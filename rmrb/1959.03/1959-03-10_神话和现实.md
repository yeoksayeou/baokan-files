    Myths and Reality
    Lin Mohan

    In old China, there was a superstition: when a child was born into a family, to prevent him from dying young, they would give him a lowly name like "Dog" or "Cat" to show contempt, so as to avoid attracting the attention of the god of death. This method is now also being used by the apologists for capitalism. To save capitalism from extinction, they have come up with an idea: to give capitalism another name. The difference is: one gives a newborn child an ugly name, and the other gives a dying fellow a nice name; the former to deceive the god of death, and the latter to deceive the people.

    For this purpose, they gave capitalism a new name, called "People's Capitalism." They thought that as long as they put a "People's" hat on capitalism, the people would like it. Those bourgeois scholars who have sold their souls have also concocted a set of myths for this. They used all kinds of hypocritical arguments to try to prove that it seems that in the United States and some other capitalist countries, capital already belongs to the people, because many workers have stocks, they have become shareholders of large factories and mines, and are the "masters" of these factories and enterprises. The bourgeois spokesmen boasted with great seriousness, and those revisionist crows who betrayed the working class also hurriedly chimed in with the tone of orioles.

    Myths are beautiful, but when they encounter reality, they go bankrupt. The myth of "People's Capitalism" also cannot stand the test of facts.

    What are the facts?

    On the one hand, some small clerks or some workers use the few dollars they have managed to save to buy one or two small shares of a certain company, and are considered so-called shareholders of that company; on the other hand, there are big bosses like Rockefeller and Morgan. According to statistics, the former controls 61.4 billion US dollars of capital, and the latter controls 65.4 billion US dollars of capital. Who would believe that these two kinds of people are the same "capitalists" in the United States, the same "masters" of those large factories and mines?

    Comrade Khrushchev said it well: "What is the actual situation of those workers and employees who have been deceived, who have used their labor savings to buy some small shares and become shareholders, become 'masters' of capitalist enterprises? When a crisis comes, the real master grabs these 'masters'—the shareholders—by the ears and throws them out of the enterprises in which they have shares. The shareholder becomes one of the millions of unemployed. Then it is the turn of this kind of 'master' to eagerly hope: perhaps he is fortunate enough to regain his job, perhaps he himself will not starve to death and plunge his whole family into desperation."

    This is exactly the case. Moreover, not only when a crisis comes, but even in their so-called "return to prosperity," the unemployment rate of workers is increasing. The British "News Chronicle" on March 3 published a report from its special correspondent in Washington, which said that in Detroit, a large industrial city, "despite the recovery after last year's severe depression, there are still 194,000 workers unemployed. This is an increase of 3,000 from a year ago, accounting for more than 12% of the city's labor force." The reporter also said: "This illustrates a cruel new phenomenon in the United States: while productivity is rising, the number of unemployed is also rising." And "this phenomenon is not mysterious, the situation is the same throughout the United States."

    What is the situation in other capitalist countries? Let's take another example from France. According to the Paris "Express" weekly on February 19: "On the workers' side, there is no sector, no region that is not hit and threatened by unemployment. Any dismissed worker finds it difficult to find a job again. Because large companies no longer hire people. On the other hand, they no longer make up for the positions left vacant due to death, illness or retirement. Some enterprises are dismissing or preparing to dismiss workers."

    Who would believe that these French workers who are tightening their belts and struggling on the starvation line, and the 200 richest families in France, are enjoying the same "happiness" and "joy" "bestowed" by capitalism?

    Engels said that people can arbitrarily call a shoe brush a mammal, but you can't squeeze a drop of milk from a shoe brush. The bourgeois apologists can also give capitalism all kinds of pleasant names, such as "People's Capitalism" or "Capital Democratization," but it will neither bring bread to the unemployed workers nor bring houses to the unemployed workers. The lessons of facts are more powerful than any fascinating myth. The workers of the capitalist world have understood that their responsibility is to send that rotten and dirty "shoe brush" - the capitalist system, to the museum as soon as possible, just like an outdated carriage!

    神话和现实
    林默涵
    我国旧时候有一种迷信：谁家生了孩子，为了怕他夭折，就给他取一个阿狗阿猫之类的名字，以表示轻贱，这样可以避免引起死神的注意。这个方法，现在也被资本主义的辩护士们所采用了。为了挽救资本主义的灭亡，他们想出了一个主意，就是给资本主义另外取一个名字。所不同的是：一个给刚生的小孩取难听的名字，一个给快死的家伙取好听的名字，前者为了瞒过死神，后者则为了欺骗人民。
    为了这个目的，他们就给资本主义取了一个新名字，叫做“人民资本主义”。他们以为只要给资本主义戴上一顶“人民”的帽子，人民就会喜欢它了。那些卖身投靠的资产阶级学者们还为此编造了一套神话。他们用各种虚伪的论据，企图证明似乎在美国和其他一些资本主义国家里，资本已经属于人民了，因为许多职工都有了股票，他们已经成为大厂矿大企业的股东，是这些厂矿和企业的“主人”了。资产阶级的说客们像煞有介事地大吹大擂，那些背叛工人阶级的修正主义乌鸦们也装着黄莺的声调赶紧帮腔。
    神话是美丽的，可是一碰到现实，它就破产了。“人民资本主义”的神话也是根本经不住事实的对证的。
    事实怎样呢？
    一方面是一些小职员或者一些工人，他们用好容易积蓄下来的几块钱，买了某家公司一两份小额股票，就算是那家公司的所谓股东了；另一方面是洛克菲勒和摩根之类的大老板，据统计，前者所控制的资本有六百一十四亿美元，后者所控制的资本有六百五十四亿美元。谁会相信，这两种人是美国的同样的“资本家”，是那些大厂矿大企业的同样的“主人”呢？
    赫鲁晓夫同志说得好：“那些上了当的工人和职员，他们用自己的劳动储蓄购买了若干小额股票而成为股东，成为资本主义企业的‘主人’，实际上他们的情况究竟怎样呢？当危机现象来临的时候，真正的主人就揪住这些‘主人’——股东的耳朵，把他们从那些有他们股份的企业中抛出去了。股东变成了几百万失业大军中的一员。于是轮到这种‘主人’来殷殷期望：也许他有幸重新获得工作，也许他自己不致饿死和使他全家陷入绝路一条。”
    事实正是这样。而且，不仅在危机到来时，就在他们的所谓“再度出现繁荣局面”时，工人失业率也是有增无已。3月3日的英国“新闻纪事报”登载了该报特派记者从华盛顿发回的一篇报道，其中说，在底特律这个大工业城市中，“尽管在去年的严重萧条后现在有了复苏，但是仍然有十九万四千名工人失业。这比一年前增加了三千人，占全市劳动力的12％以上。”这位记者又说：“这说明美国的一种残酷的新现象：在生产率上升的时候，失业人数也在上升。”而“这种现象并不神秘，美国各地情况都是一样。”
    其他资本主义国家的情形又怎样呢？我们再举一个法国的例子吧。据2月19日巴黎“快报”周刊说：“在工人方面，没有一个部门，没有一个地区不遭到失业的打击和威胁。任何一个被解雇的工人都很难再找到工作。因为大公司不再雇人了。另一方面，它们也不再弥补由于死亡、生病或退休而空出来的位子。有些企业正在解雇或准备解雇工人。”
    谁又会相信，这些勒紧裤带在饥饿线上挣扎的法国工人，跟法国最有钱的二百个家族是享受着资本主义所“赐与”的同样的“幸福”和“快乐”呢？
    恩格斯说过，人们可以任意把鞋刷子叫做哺乳动物，但是，你从鞋刷子里面是怎么也挤不出一滴奶汁来的。资产阶级的辩护士们也尽可以给资本主义取各种动听的名字，什么“人民资本主义”呀，“资本民主化”呀，但是它既不会给失业工人带来面包，也不会给失业工人带来房子。事实的教训，比任何迷人的神话都要有力量。资本主义世界的工人们已经明白，他们的责任是把那个腐朽透顶的、肮脏的“鞋刷子”——资本主义制度，跟过了时的马车一样尽快地送到博物馆里去！
