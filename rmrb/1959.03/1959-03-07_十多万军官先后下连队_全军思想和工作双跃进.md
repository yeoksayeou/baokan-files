Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch. The Chinese People's Liberation Army units are conscientiously implementing the system of officers becoming soldiers. The first batch of officers becoming soldiers this year have arrived at their respective companies recently.

This year, the cadres going down to companies to serve as soldiers in various units are characterized by early arrangements, rapid action, and great determination. As early as around the Spring Festival, the leading organs of the garrisons in various parts of the country carefully and meticulously arranged the plan for cadres to become soldiers this year, and determined the number of people, time, and order of priority for going down to the companies in batches according to the work situation. Then, they began to implement it. Units in areas such as Guangzhou and Jinan, which acted relatively quickly, currently have several thousand officers who have gone down to the companies to serve as soldiers. A certain unit of the garrison in the Shenyang area comprehensively arranged its work, and more than 45% of the office cadres went down to the companies in early March. In Beijing, Nanjing, Kunming, Wuhan, Lanzhou and other places, the first batch of officers to go down to the companies are also mostly ready and are either going down to the companies or will be doing so soon. Li Shuiqing, a major general and leader of a certain unit of the Qingdao garrison, and some other officers who had already served as soldiers once last year, once again took the lead in becoming soldiers this year. A large number of cadres who originally worked in the company have also recently begun to take turns serving as soldiers in their own companies.

Before departing, the first batch of officers who became soldiers this year made full ideological and material preparations, expressing that they must put down their airs, treat people equally, respect the squad leader, care for the soldiers, work actively, learn with an open mind, and work with the company officers and soldiers to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks, and strive for a double harvest in ideology and work, and become a "five-good soldier." After arriving at the company, they lived, ate, operated, labored, and entertained with the soldiers as ordinary soldiers, and set an example in everything, and carried out training in a secure, open-minded, and happy manner. Many generals and leading cadres are also prepared to spend some time after a month of being soldiers to participate in grass-roots leadership work on the spot or inspect the main work of the troops, in order to solve problems in a timely manner, strengthen grass-roots construction, and lay a good foundation for a comprehensive leap forward in various tasks this year.

    十多万军官先后下连队
    全军思想和工作双跃进
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军各部队认真贯彻执行干部当兵制度，今年首批当兵的军官，已在最近先后到达连队。
    今年各部队干部下连当兵，都具有安排早、行动快、决心大的特点。早在春节前后，全国各地驻军领导机关就认真细致地安排今年干部当兵的规划，根据工作情况，确定了分批下连的人数、时间和先后次序。接着，就开始实施。行动较快的广州、济南等地区部队，目前下连当兵的军官已有几千人。沈阳地区驻军某部全面安排了工作，45％以上的机关干部都在3月初下了连。北京、南京、昆明、武汉、兰州等地部队，首批下连当兵的军官，也大多整装就绪，正在或即将分头下连。青岛驻军某部首长李水清少将等一些去年已经当过一次兵的军官，今年又一马当先带头当兵。大批原在连队工作的干部，也已于最近开始轮流在本连当兵。
    今年首批当兵的军官在出发之前，都作了充分的思想准备和物质准备，表示一定要放下架子、平等待人，尊重班长，爱护士兵，积极工作，虚心学习，和连队官兵一起，完成和超额完成今年各项任务，争取思想、工作双丰收，当个“五好战士”。下到连队之后，都以普通一兵的身分，和士兵同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动、同娱乐，并且处处以身作则，安心、虚心、愉快地进行锻炼。许多将军和领导干部，还准备在当兵一月之后，再抽出一段时间，就地参加基层领导工作或对部队主要工作进行检查，以便及时解决问题，加强基层建设，为今年度的各项工作全面大跃进打下良好的基础。
