Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The No. 1 medium-sized blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company was put into production at the end of February. The company's five medium-sized blast furnaces, which started construction last year, have now all been completed and put into production ahead of schedule. Their total effective volume is 1,170 cubic meters, and they can produce more than 1,000 tons of iron per day.

These five medium-sized blast furnaces were designed by the Wuhan Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute. From charging to iron tapping, the entire production process of each blast furnace is basically mechanized. The entire set of equipment on the blast furnaces is made in China.

Currently, the workers of the five blast furnaces are carrying out a red flag competition, determined to increase the daily production level to more than 1,000 tons, and strive to complete the province's steel production targets.

    马鞍山新建五座高炉投入生产
    新华社讯　马鞍山钢铁公司一号中型高炉在2月底投入生产。这个公司去年动工兴建的五座中型高炉，至此已全部提前建成投入生产。它们的有效容积共为一千一百七十立方公尺，每天可出铁一千多吨。
    这五座中型高炉是武汉黑色冶金设计院设计的，每座高炉从上料到出铁，整个生产过程基本上都是机械化操作。高炉上的整套设备全部由我国自造。
    目前，五座高炉的职工正在开展红旗竞赛，决心把日产水平提高到千吨以上，为完成全省的钢铁生产指标而奋斗。
