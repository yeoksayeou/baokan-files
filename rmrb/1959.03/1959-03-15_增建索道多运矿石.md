Increase the construction of cableways to transport more ore
The existing cableway of the Yingde pyrite mine in Guangdong can only carry 1,300 tons per day. This year, the mine's production task will increase by two times compared to last year. In order to transport more ore from the mine to the railway trunk line station, it has been decided to add a one-kilometer-long aerial cableway this year.

    增建索道多运矿石
    广东的英德硫铁矿原有索道每天只能载运一千三百吨。今年这个矿的生产任务将较去年增加两倍，为了更多的把矿石从矿山运到铁路干线车站，今年决定增设一座一公里长的架空索道。
