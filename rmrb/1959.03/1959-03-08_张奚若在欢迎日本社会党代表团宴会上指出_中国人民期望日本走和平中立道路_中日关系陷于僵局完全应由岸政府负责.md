    Zhang Xiruo Points Out at Banquet Welcoming Japanese Socialist Party Delegation That Chinese People Hope Japan Will Take a Path of Peace and Neutrality; The Impasse in Sino-Japanese Relations is Entirely the Responsibility of the Kishi Government
    (Our Newspaper) News – Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, gave the following full text of his speech at a banquet on the evening of the 7th to welcome the Japanese Socialist Party delegation:
    Ladies and gentlemen, friends:
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, to extend a warm welcome to the Japanese Socialist Party delegation headed by Mr. Inejiro Asanuma for their second visit to our country.
    In April 1957, a goodwill mission of the Japanese Socialist Party led by Mr. Asanuma visited our country for the first time. During the visit, we exchanged views extensively on issues of common concern to both countries, and reached a consensus on many important issues. Finally, the joint statement issued by Mr. Asanuma and myself expressed our common aspirations. Nearly two years have passed since that visit.
    In these two years, although there have been twists and turns in the relationship between China and Japan, the Japanese Socialist Party's position on promoting friendship between the people of our two countries, improving relations between our two countries, and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world has not changed, and they have made a series of efforts and great contributions. We express our heartfelt admiration for this.
    The people of our country fully support the Japanese Socialist Party's proposition of breaking the Japan-U.S. security system and Japan's path toward peace and neutrality. We believe that this is a realistic and feasible path for Japan to move towards peace and prosperity. The people of our country have always hoped that our neighbor, Japan, can become an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country, and live in friendship and peace with all countries on an equal footing. The people of our country agree with the Japanese Socialist Party's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We believe that this is a relatively important step and measure to ease international tensions and ensure peace in the Far East and the world. The people of our country are willing to work together with friends from the Japanese Socialist Party to promote its realization.
    The people of our country welcome the Japanese Socialist Party's repeated explicit expression of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and opposing "two Chinas." The people of our country are willing to cooperate with friends from the Japanese Socialist Party to continue to work to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.
    Speaking of the relationship between our two countries, I think you all know that in the year after our joint statement was issued, thanks to the joint efforts of the people of our two countries and the active assistance of our government, trade and cultural exchanges between our two countries had greatly developed, making this year the year with the most exchanges between our two countries since the war. But regrettably, the development of trade and cultural exchanges between our two countries has not led to a corresponding improvement in the political relations between our two countries. This is because the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government not only did not make corresponding efforts to improve relations between the two countries, but on the contrary,妄想 to use non-governmental exchanges between China and Japan, especially trade exchanges, to deceive the Japanese people, obtain economic benefits, and politically pursue his consistent policy of following the United States and being hostile to China. Kishi Nobusuke tore up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, repeatedly condoned thugs to insult our national flag, and followed the United States in playing the "two Chinas" conspiracy. The Chinese people certainly cannot tolerate the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile and two-faced approach towards China. In this situation, trade relations between the two countries have been completely interrupted, and friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries cannot but be seriously affected. The impasse in Sino-Japanese relations is entirely the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    The reactionary policy adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke government on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations is completely contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people, and has been met with increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese people. The movement of people from all walks of life in Japan against Kishi Nobusuke's hostility towards China and demanding the restoration of normal relations with China is higher than ever before, and even some enlightened people in the ruling party of Japan have risen up to attack Kishi Nobusuke's China policy. The Kishi Nobusuke government, which is in a desperate situation, in order to ease the pressure on it from all sides, and in order to overcome its political and economic crisis, has recently reiterated the cliché of breaking the impasse in Sino-Japanese relations under the principle of so-called separation of politics and economics. But anyone with discernment can see that this is purely a hypocritical and deceptive gesture. In fact, since the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade relations, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not only shown no sign of repentance, but on the contrary, has intensified its policy of hostility towards China. Kishi Nobusuke openly supported the United States' expansion of aggression against China, falsely accused our country of being an "aggressor," and further colluded with the United States in an attempt to revive Japanese militarism by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," making Japan a nuclear base and accomplice for the United States to carry out aggression in the Asia-Pacific region. This fully exposed Kishi Nobusuke's so-called improvement of Sino-Japanese relations as insincere, and it was nothing more than continuing to play two-faced tricks on the basis of his basic policy of hostility towards China. The reason why Kishi Nobusuke issued this argument, as Mr. Asanuma told reporters in Hong Kong: The main reason is that the power of the Japanese people's opposition to his policy of hostility towards China is getting stronger and stronger, so Kishi Nobusuke has to make such a gesture to deceive the people and win votes for the upcoming elections.
    Recently, the spokesperson of our government has repeatedly refuted Kishi Nobusuke's fallacy of so-called separation of politics and economics, and has made clear our people's fundamental position on breaking the impasse in Sino-Japanese relations. There can be no change in this position of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always believed that the economic exchanges and political relations between China and Japan must not be separated. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its policy of hostility towards our country, continues to play the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and continues to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, trade relations between China and Japan cannot be restored, and the current impasse between the two countries cannot be broken. Therefore, if we want to talk, we can only talk about politics and economics together, and solve them together, otherwise there is no way to talk.
    Nevertheless, the people of our country have always been friendly to the Japanese people. Moreover, we and our friends from the Japanese Socialist Party have so many common points on the issues of safeguarding peace, improving Sino-Japanese relations, opposing American aggression, upholding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and striving to establish an Asian zone of peace and neutrality and a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We are friends and comrades in arms for peace. With the best wishes, we welcome you to visit our country. We are willing to frankly exchange views with you on issues of common concern, and are willing to make joint efforts to improve relations between our two countries. We believe that this effort will never be in vain, and it will have a far-reaching impact on establishing long-term friendly relations between the people of China and Japan.
    Ladies and gentlemen, since your last visit to our country, our country has also undergone great changes. Since last year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country have realized an all-round Great Leap Forward. Our people's commune movement has achieved great victories. At present, the people of our country are working hard to achieve a bigger and better leap forward this year. You are welcome to visit various places to see that the people of our country are engaged in peaceful labor, and I hope you will give us more advice.
    Finally, let us
    For the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people,
    For peace in Asia and the world,
    Let's drink to the health of Mr. Asanuma and the members of the delegation.

    张奚若在欢迎日本社会党代表团宴会上指出
    中国人民期望日本走和平中立道路
    中日关系陷于僵局完全应由岸政府负责
    本报讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若在7日晚间为欢迎日本社会党代表团而举行的宴会上讲话全文如下：各位先生、各位朋友：
    请允许我代表中国人民外交学会，对以浅沼稻次郎先生为首的日本社会党代表团再次来我国访问，表示热诚的欢迎。
    1957年4月，由浅沼先生率领的日本社会党亲善使节团来我国进行了首次访问。在访问期间，我们曾就两国共同有关的问题广泛地交换了意见，并且在许多重要问题上取得了一致的看法。最后由浅沼先生和我发表的共同声明，表达了我们的共同愿望。从那次访问起，时间已经过去将近两年了。
    在这两年中，中日两国间的关系虽然发生了曲折的变化，但是日本社会党关于增进我们两国人民的友谊、改善我们两国的关系，以及维护远东和世界和平的立场始终没有改变，并且进行了一系列的努力，作出了很大的贡献。对此我们表示衷心的敬佩。
    我国人民完全支持日本社会党提出的打破日美安全体制和日本走向和平中立道路的主张。我们认为这是日本走向和平和繁荣的现实可行的道路。我国人民从来就期望我们的近邻——日本能够成为一个独立、民主、和平中立的国家，在平等的基础上同一切国家友好和平相处。我国人民赞同日本社会党所提出的设立非核武器地带的主张。我们认为，这是缓和国际紧张局势，保障远东和世界和平的一个较为重要的步骤和措施。我国人民愿意同日本社会党的朋友们一起为促其实现而共同奋斗。
    我国人民欢迎日本社会党所一再明确表示的恢复中日邦交和反对“两个中国”的主张。我国人民愿意同日本社会党朋友们合作，为促进中日两国邦交的恢复而继续努力。
    谈到我们两国的关系，我想诸位都知道，在我们共同声明发表后的一年中，由于我们两国人民的共同努力，由于我国政府的积极协助，我们两国的贸易和文化来往，曾经有过很大的发展，使这一年成为战后我们两国来往最多的一年。但是遗憾的是，我们两国贸易和文化来往的发展，没有能够使我们两国的政治关系得到相应的改善。这是因为日本岸信介政府，不仅不对改善两国关系作出相应的努力，相反的，却妄想利用中日民间的往来特别是贸易往来，欺骗日本人民，捞取经济实惠，而在政治上执行他一贯的追随美国、敌视中国的政策。岸信介撕毁了第四次中日贸易协定，一再纵容暴徒污辱我国国旗，并且追随美国玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋。中国人民当然绝不能容忍岸信介政府这种敌视中国的两面三刀的做法。在这种情况下，两国的贸易关系陷于完全中断，而两国人民的友好来往也不能不受到严重的影响。中日关系之所以陷于目前的僵局，这应该由岸信介政府负完全的责任。
    岸信介政府在中日关系问题上所采取的这种反动的政策是完全违背日本人民的意愿的，并且遭到了日本人民越来越强烈的反对。日本各阶层人民反对岸信介敌视中国、要求同中国恢复正常关系的运动比过去任何时候都更加高涨，连日本执政党中的某些有识之士也起来攻击岸信介的对华政策。处在四面楚歌下的岸信介政府，为了缓和各方面对它的压力，为了度过它在政治上和经济上的危机，最近又重弹所谓在政治和经济分开的原则下打开中日关系僵局的滥调。但是明眼人一看便知，这纯粹是一种虚伪的欺骗姿态。事实上自从中日贸易关系中断以来，岸信介政府不仅丝毫没有悔悟之意，相反的，却更加变本加厉地执行着它的敌视中国的政策。岸信介公然支持美国向中国扩大侵略的行为，诬蔑我国为“侵略者”，并且进一步同美国狼狈为奸，企图通过修改日美“安全条约”加紧复活日本军国主义，使日本成为美国在亚洲和太平洋地区进行侵略的原子基地和帮凶。这就充分暴露了岸信介的所谓改善中日关系是毫无诚意的，它不过是在敌视中国的基本政策的基础上继续玩两面三刀的花招而已。岸信介之所以发出这种论调，正如浅沼先生在香港对记者所说的：主要原因是由于日本人民反对他的敌视中国的政策的力量越来越强大，因此岸信介不得不作出这样的姿态来欺骗人民，为快要来到的选举，争取选票。
    最近一个时期来，我国政府发言人曾经反复驳斥了岸信介所谓政治和经济分开的谬论，表明了我国人民对于打开中日关系僵局的根本立场。中国人民的这种立场是不可能有任何改变的。中国人民始终认为，中日两国的经济来往和政治关系决不能分开，只要岸信介政府一天不改变它敌视我国的政策，继续玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠中日关系的正常化，中日两国的贸易关系就无法恢复，两国目前的僵局就无法打开。因此，要谈只有政治和经济一齐来谈，一齐解决，否则就无从谈起。
    尽管如此，我国人民对日本人民始终是友好的。并且，我们和日本社会党的朋友在保卫和平，改善中日关系，反对美国侵略，拥护和平共处的五项原则和万隆精神，争取设立亚洲和平中立地带和无原子区域等问题上有这么多共同点，我们是朋友，又是和平的战友。我们怀着最好的愿望，欢迎诸位来我国访问，我们愿意同你们就共同有关的问题坦率地交换意见，并愿意对改善我们两国的关系共同作出努力。我们相信这种努力绝不会是徒劳的，它必将为建立中日两国人民长期友好关系发生深远影响。
    各位先生，自从上次你们访问我国以后，我们国家也有了很大的变化。去年以来，我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，实现了全面的大跃进，我们的人民公社运动已经取得了伟大的胜利，目前我国人民正在为了实现今年更大、更好的跃进而奋斗。欢迎诸位到各地去看看，看看我国人民所进行的是和平劳动，并希望诸位多多指教。
    最后，让我们
    为中日两国人民的友谊，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为浅沼先生和代表团各位先生的健康干杯。
