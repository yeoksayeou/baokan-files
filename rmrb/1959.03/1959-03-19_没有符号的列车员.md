    The Conductor Without Insignia
    Pan Siyun
    In the first carriage of the Express Train No. 18 from Pukou to Shenyang, two passengers were arguing over a seat. Nearby passengers were trying to mediate. At this moment, a robust young man, wearing a white jersey and dark blue woolen trousers, walked over, wiping the sweat from his face. "Alright, don't argue," he said. "There are seats over there, come on!" As he spoke, he pulled one of them towards the other side, as intimately as if he were pulling his own brother.

    The train moved smoothly forward, and the spring sunshine outside the window was pleasant. From time to time, crowds of people building railways or working hard to accumulate fertilizer flashed past the window. "Ah! The Great Leap Forward, everywhere is full of enthusiasm!" An old man looked out the window and said excitedly. "Have a bowl of water, old man!" It was the young man in the white jersey again, carrying a large water bottle. "Drink water? Thank you, the bowl you poured for me just now hasn't been drunk yet," the old man replied. "Let me change it to a hot one!" He changed the water and walked on.

    "This attendant is so thoughtful. He saw me take out biscuits and immediately brought water. Before getting on the train, my daughter was afraid that the water supply on the train wouldn't be timely, so she bought me a basket of fruit. Hah! She wasted her worry," the old man praised, laughing at the last sentence.

    "Comrade! Excuse me, lift your legs." It was him again, the young man in the white jersey, sweeping the carriage.

    Then he wiped the small tables and the windows. He was really busy!

    "Comrade! Sit down and rest for a while." When the young man in the white jersey was wiping the old man's window, the old man pulled him, insisting that he sit in his seat.

    "Thank you, old man, I'm not tired, you sit."

    "Listen to the opinions of the masses, telling you to rest for a while." The old man pulled him into the seat and said to the young man in the white jersey, "Are you a Red Banner Holder? Are you an advanced worker?"

    The young man in the white jersey smiled and didn't answer.

    The old man took out two big apples from the bamboo basket and handed them to the young man in the white jersey, "Here, eat them."

    "Thank you, you eat them!"

    "I have plenty here, eat them, eat them." The old man kept stuffing them into his hands. "What, don't want to eat what this old man has?" The old man was a little angry.

    "Eat, eat." Saying this, he took one and ate it.

    "Comrade! What's your number?" A girl next to him flicked her long braid and asked the young man in the white jersey.

    "What?" The young man in the white jersey didn't seem to understand her meaning.

    "What's the number on your attendant certificate?" The girl added. It seemed she was planning to write him a letter of praise.

    The young man in the white jersey smiled and didn't answer.

    At this time, the loudspeaker loudly broadcast:

    "On our train, there is a naval officer who has been helping the conductors deliver water and clean the carriages since he got on the train, without any rest. The broadcasting room, on behalf of all the crew members of this train, expresses our gratitude to you! And please put down the tools in your hand immediately and go back to your seat to rest."

    "Ah! Is that you? You're a naval officer?..."

    "Where are you getting off?" The naval officer in the white jersey asked the old man.

    After listening to the old man, it turned out they were getting off at the same station ahead.

    "I'll call you later, goodbye!"

    The train sped along. The loudspeaker announcing the station names rang out. A young naval officer in a woolen overcoat walked up to the old man, "Old man! The station is almost here, get ready to get off." He carried the old man's old blue cloth bundle and helped the old man get off the train together.

    没有符号的列车员
    潘思云
    从浦口开往沈阳的18次直快列车的一号车厢里，有两个旅客为座位问题争执起来了，邻近的乘客正在劝解，这时，一位体格魁梧的青年，上穿白色球衣，下着丈青呢裤走了过来，他擦着满脸汗水说，“算了，甭吵啦，那边有座位，来！”他说着就拉着其中的一位向那边走去了，像拉着自己的亲兄弟一样，那么亲切。
    火车平稳地前进，窗外春阳怡人，不时有兴建铁路或大搞积肥的劳动的人群，从窗前掠过。“啊！大跃进，处处干劲冲天啊！”一位老大爷望着窗外激动的说。“喝碗水吧，老大爷！”仍是那个穿白色球衣的青年，携着个大水壶。“喝水？谢谢，刚才您给我斟的一碗还没喝哩。”老大爷回答。“换碗热的吧！”他换完水，又向前走去。
    “这位服务员真周到，他见我拿出饼干，马上就把水送上。上车前，我女儿怕车上供水不及时，还给我买了一篓水果。嗐！她算是白操这份心了。”老大爷夸赞着，说到最后一句，笑起来了。
    “同志！劳驾，抬抬腿。”又是他，那个穿白球衣的青年，拿着扫帚在打扫车厢。
    接着又擦小桌，擦门窗。真是忙个不停！
    “同志！坐下来歇会儿吧。”当穿白球衣的擦老大爷那扇窗子的时候，老大爷拉着他，强要他坐在自己的座位上。
    “谢谢您，老大爷，不累，您坐着吧。”
    “听见吧，群众的意见，叫你休息会儿。”老大爷一面拉他在座位上坐下，一面对穿白球衣的说，“你是红旗手吧？是先进工作者吧？”
    穿白球衣的微笑着，没有回答。
    老大爷从篾篓里掏出两只大苹果送到穿白球衣的面前，“来，吃了吧。”
    “谢谢，您吃吧！”
    “我这儿多的是，吃吧，吃吧。”老大爷直往他手上塞，“怎么，不愿吃我老汉的东西？”老大爷有点生气了。
    “吃，吃。”说着他接过一个来就吃。
    “同志！您是几号？”旁边一位姑娘甩了一下长辫子朝着穿白球衣的问。
    “什么？”穿白球衣的似乎没听懂她的意思。
    “您的服务员证的号码是几号？”姑娘又补充说。看来，她打算给他写封表扬信啦。
    穿白球衣的微笑着，没有回答。
    这时，扩音器里大声的播送着：
    “在我们这次列车上，有一位海军军官，他从上车一直到现在都在帮助列车员送水，清扫车厢，毫不消闲。广播室代表本次列车全体乘务员向您表示谢意！并请您马上放下您手上的工具，回到您的坐位上去休息吧。”
    “啊！这说的是您？您是海军军官？……”
    “您到哪儿下车？”穿白球衣的海军军官问老大爷。
    听老大爷一说，原来他们同在前面一个站下车。
    “一会儿我来招呼您，再见！”
    车，飞速地奔驰着。报告站名的扩音器响了。一位穿着呢大衣的雄赳赳的青年海军军官走到老大爷的面前，“老大爷！快到站啦，准备下车吧。”他给老大爷携着老蓝布的包袱，扶着老大爷一块儿下车了。
