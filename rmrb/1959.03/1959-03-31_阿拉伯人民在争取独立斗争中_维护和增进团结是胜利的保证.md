Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article signed "Observer" entitled "The Unity of the Arab People in the Struggle for Independence is the Guarantee of Victory."

	The article recalls that Arab leaders, primarily President Gamal Abdel Nasser, have pointed out more than once that the Arab people, in their struggle for independence, and the Egyptian people, in their struggle against imperialist aggression, have received the support of peace-loving countries, especially the Soviet Union, and consider this support and assistance to be of great significance. The article also quoted President Nasser's speeches, in which he gave due credit to the Soviet Union's friendly attitude towards Egypt and later the UAR. However, the article continues, the Soviet people were very surprised to learn that in a series of recent statements by Mr. Nasser, the assessment of the Soviet Union's support for the Arab people's liberation struggle and its opposition to the armed intervention of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel seriously violated well-known historical facts and the UAR President's own past statements. In a speech in Damascus in late March, Nasser spoke of the tripartite aggression of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel and said: "In those days, brothers, we did not see any indication of assistance from any foreign country, including the Soviet Union." Regarding this speech, the article wrote: It is difficult to understand why Mr. Nasser has changed his view of the Soviet Union's role in stopping the aggression against Egypt, a role that is well known in the world beyond the Near East. Even the Associated Press, which is absolutely not well-disposed towards the Soviet Union, pointed out that Britain and France decided to cease fire after the Soviet Union issued a warning.

	The article went on to say that the Soviet Union had firmly defended Syria when imperialist conspiracies were directed against it. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries had provided effective support to the people of the Arab countries to counter imperialist armed interventionists, and had helped Iraq and the UAR to avoid being struck, enabling the occupying forces to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. Arab national leaders have expressed their gratitude for this assistance. Now, Mr. Nasser claims that no one but Allah has stood on the side of the Arab people. The article asked, can the Arab liberation movement be completely separated from the anti-imperialist liberation movements of other countries? Can the Arabs be isolated from other peoples? Can it be denied that the Arab national liberation movement has received and continues to receive genuine support from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, all the socialist countries of Europe and Asia, and other peace-loving countries?

	The article then pointed out that the attempt to slander those countries that have sincerely and friendly helped the Arab people is linked to the current frenzied propaganda campaign in the UAR against Communists, against "international Communism," and against the leaders of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as against the Republic of Iraq. The author wrote that not long ago, enemies of Egypt and Syria accused Cairo and Damascus of "submitting to communism," and now it is strange, but true, that some people in Cairo are trying to accuse Baghdad in this way. King Hussein, the puppet ruler of Jordan, who has only retained his throne thanks to the support of the U.S. and British imperialists, is currently in Washington boasting of supporting the anti-communist movement in the UAR, bragging that he is second to none in this regard.

	The article noted the fact that some newspapers in the UAR, such as the publications of the Amin brothers, are now particularly keen on carrying out propaganda and clamoring, and it is well known that they have close ties with Western imperialist groups. It is these newspapers that are spreading the absurd claims of so-called "communist conspiracies" hindering Arab unity.

	It is also noted that the current propaganda campaign is unfolding at a time when internal difficulties in the Syrian region of the UAR have increased due to the conspiracies of leaders of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party. These leaders are doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the Arab people, promote hatred of progressive forces, and create internal strife.

	The article continued: Recently, there has been a situation in which certain activists in the Near East, under the banner of Arab nationalism, want to implement the idea of immediately and mechanically merging all Arab countries into one state, regardless of whether these countries are willing or not. Anyone who disagrees with this is accused of being a Zionist, a Communist, an enemy of the Arab people; all progressive movements among the Arabs are groundlessly opposed to Arab nationalism. In this way, instead of uniting the anti-imperialist forces, discord has appeared. This can only benefit the enemies of the people's freedom, and benefit the imperialists.

	"Observer" pointed out that the current situation in the relations between Arab countries objectively will not only fail to enhance their unity in the anti-imperialist struggle, but, on the contrary, has opened a gap in this unity, and the colonialists are rushing to use this gap to sow discord among the Arab countries and restore their "influence" in the Near East. The enemies of Arab-Soviet friendship are precisely for this purpose spreading vile slanders, insisting that the Soviet Union is changing its policy towards the Arab countries.

	"Observer" emphasized that the Soviet people resolutely sweep away such slanderous remarks. The Soviet Union has pursued, and will continue to firmly pursue, a sincere and friendly policy towards the UAR, other Arab countries, and the people of Asian and African countries who defend freedom and independence.

### 阿拉伯人民在争取独立斗争中  维护和增进团结是胜利的保证

    阿拉伯人民在争取独立斗争中
    维护和增进团结是胜利的保证
    苏联“真理报”观察家文章摘要
    新华社30日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：苏联“真理报”发表了一篇署名“观察家”的文章，题目是“阿拉伯人民在争取独立斗争中的团结是胜利的保证。”
    文章回顾说，阿拉伯人民的领导人，首先是阿卜杜勒·加麦尔·纳赛尔总统曾经不止一次地指出，阿拉伯人在争取独立的斗争中以及埃及人民在反击帝国主义侵略的斗争中，都得到了爱好和平的国家的支持，特别是得到了苏联的帮助，并且认为这种支持和帮助具有重大意义。文章还摘引了纳赛尔总统的讲话，他在讲话中对苏联对埃及以及对后来的阿联的友好态度作了应有的评价。但是，文章接着说，苏联人民十分惊讶地得知，在纳赛尔先生最近发表的一系列言论中，对于苏联支持阿拉伯人的解放斗争和反对英法以三国武装干涉埃及的这种立场的评价，严重违反了人所共知的历史事实和阿联总统本人过去的言论。纳赛尔3月下旬在大马士革的演说中谈到了英法以三国的侵略，并且说：“在这些日子里，兄弟们，我们并没有看到任何外国，包括苏联在内有给予援助的任何表示”。文章就这篇演说写道：很难理解，为什么纳赛尔先生改变了自己对苏联在制止侵略埃及方面的作用的看法，而这种作用在近东以外的世界是人所共知的。就连对苏联绝对不怀有好意的美联社都指出，英国和法国是在苏联提出了警告之后才决定停火的。
    文章接着说，苏联在帝国主义阴谋反对叙利亚的时候曾坚决地维护过叙利亚。苏联和其他社会主义国家曾经给予阿拉伯各国人民有效的支持以反击帝国主义武装干涉者，曾经帮助伊拉克和阿联免遭打击，使占领军撤出了黎巴嫩和约旦。阿拉伯国家领袖曾经对这种援助表示感谢。现在纳赛尔先生声称，除了真主以外，任何人都不曾站在阿拉伯人民方面。文章问道，难道可以把阿拉伯的解放运动和其他国家的反帝解放运动截然分开么？难道可以把阿拉伯人同其他各国人民隔绝么？难道可以否认阿拉伯人的民族解放运动过去和现在一直得到苏联、中华人民共和国以及欧亚所有社会主义国家和其他爱好和平国家的真正支持么？
    文章接着指出，企图诽谤曾真诚友好地帮助过阿拉伯人民的那些国家的做法，是同目前在阿联进行的反对共产党人、反对“国际共产主义”、反对苏联和其他社会主义国家领导人以及反对伊拉克共和国的疯狂的宣传运动有着联带关系的。作者写道，不久以前，埃及和叙利亚的敌人还指责开罗和大马士革，说它们“屈从共产主义”，而现在开罗竟有人企图这样来指责巴格达，这是令人奇怪的，然而这却是事实。只是靠了美英帝国主义者的扶植才保住了宝座的约旦现在的傀儡执政者侯赛因国王，目前在华盛顿扬言支持阿联的反共运动，自吹自擂地说，他在这方面首屈一指。
    文章注意到这样一个事实：阿联一些报纸，例如，阿明兄弟的报刊现在特别卖力进行宣传叫嚣，它们都同西方帝国主义集团有密切联系，这是许多人都知道的。正是这些报纸在散布所谓妨碍阿拉伯团结的“共产主义阴谋”的无稽之谈。
    同时还注意到，目前的宣传运动正是在这样一个时候展开的：由于阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖在阿联叙利亚地区搞阴谋，阿联的内部困难增加了。这些领袖千方百计地企图破坏阿拉伯人民的团结，宣扬对进步力量的仇视，制造内讧。
    文章接着说：最近出现了这种情况，近东的某些活动家打着阿拉伯民族主义的旗帜，要实现立即将所有的阿拉伯国家都机械地合并成为一个国家的主张，不管这些国家愿意还是不愿意。谁要是不同意这样做，谁就被指责为犹太复国主义者、共产党人、阿拉伯人民的敌人；阿拉伯人中的一切进步运动被毫无根据地同阿拉伯民族主义对立起来。这样一来，反帝力量非但没有团结起来，反而出现了不和睦的现象。这只会对人民自由的敌人有利，对帝国主义者有利。
    “观察家”指出，在阿拉伯国家关系中目前的局面在客观上不仅不会增进它们在反帝斗争中的团结，相反，却在这个团结中打开了一个缺口，殖民主义者连忙利用这个缺口来离间阿拉伯国家，恢复自己在近东的“影响”。阿拉伯——苏联友谊的敌人也正是为了这个目的在散布卑劣的诽谤，硬说苏联在改变自己对阿拉伯国家的政策。
    “观察家”强调说，苏联人民坚决扫除诽谤者的这种谰调。苏联对阿联、其他阿拉伯国家，对维护自由和独立的亚非各国人民，过去执行了、将来也会坚定地执行真诚友好的政策。
