    Getting Acquainted with New Things
    -- Letters Regarding the Poems “Two Poems on Atomic Energy”
    ·Letter from Comrade Qian Sanqiang· Editor:
    There are a few places in Comrade Fang Ji's "Two Poems on Atomic Energy" (January 27, page 8) that are not quite appropriate.
    “One-thousandth of the liberated atomic energy” – this should refer to the fission of heavy atomic nuclei, which can liberate one-thousandth of the energy contained in matter.
    "One percent of the liberated hydrogen energy" – this should refer to the nuclear fusion (or fusion) of light atomic nuclei, which can liberate a few thousandths of the energy contained in matter, but at most not up to one percent. The current thermonuclear reactions also belong to this type of phenomenon, and the energy released in large quantities in stars and the sun may also belong to this type of phenomenon.
      "If two hydrogen atoms collide, one-tenth of the energy is released" – these two sentences are not very correct. The collision of two hydrogen atoms belongs to the scope of thermal collision reactions, so at most it can liberate a few thousandths of the energy contained within. What can hopefully liberate one-tenth of the energy contained in matter is the phenomenon of mutual conversion and decay of elementary particles. The atomic nuclei of two hydrogen atoms, that is, protons, can produce the phenomenon of elementary particle interaction when they collide with each other under the action of extremely high energy. However, judging from the words and content, the author of the poem may not be referring to this type of phenomenon.
    The scientific content in literary works does not necessarily have to be too strict, but if these basic concepts can be clarified and a few words can be changed in the content, the original meaning of the poem can still be preserved.
    We still welcome writers to care about scientific activities, and don't be too nervous about small mistakes.
    Sincerely,
                                    Qian Sanqiang
    ·Letter from Comrade Fang Ji· Editor:
    I was very happy to read Comrade Qian Sanqiang’s letter that was forwarded to me. It is rare that he paid attention to such two insignificant little poems. My scientific knowledge was originally extremely limited, especially for this kind of cutting-edge science. This time in Beijing, I visited the Atomic Energy Research Institute and was very excited about our rapid achievements in the latest cutting-edge science, so I wrote those two little poems. However, because it was ultimately a temporary impression, some scientific concepts were not thoroughly understood, and I inevitably spoke like an amateur. Compared with the scientists' concern for literature, I am really ashamed! We live in the atomic age and do cultural work, and insufficient scientific knowledge is a major shortcoming. Comrade Qian Sanqiang’s concern for literature should really make us want to learn some science. Please convey my thanks to Comrade Qian Sanqiang. Sincerely!
                                  Fang Ji
            ·Editor's Note·
    Our purpose in publishing the letters of Comrade Qian Sanqiang and Comrade Fang Ji is not just to correct some defects in "Two Poems on Atomic Energy." We deeply feel that the poet strives to express new scientific and technological themes, and the scientist enthusiastically cares about literary activities. This is something that can only appear in our era and is a gratifying thing.
    The people demand that writers express our rapidly changing era in literary works, and writers also enthusiastically devote themselves to the seething life. At such a juncture, it is inevitable that we will encounter many new things and new problems. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out ten years ago: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." Our writers are familiar with war, familiar with land reform and cooperativization, but not so familiar with modern industrial construction and modern science and technology. However, how can a writer who is determined to write works worthy of our era avoid these brand-new things?
    Comrade Qian Sanqiang said, "Welcome writers to care about scientific activities," and Comrade Fang Ji said, "We have to learn some science." We feel that this is good news for readers and also good news for our socialist literary cause.

    去熟悉崭新的事物
    ——关于诗“原子能两首”的信
    ·钱三强同志的信·编辑同志：
    方纪同志的“原子能两首”（1月27日八版）中，有几处有些不妥当。
    “原子解放能的千分之一”——这里应指的是重原子核的裂变，能将物质蕴藏的能力的千分之一解放出来。
    “氢解放能的百分之一”——这里应指的是轻原子核的聚裂（或者叫熔合），能将物质蕴藏的能力的千分之几解放出来，最大不会到百分之一。现在说的热核反应也是属于这类现象，在恒星、太阳中大量解放出来的能力，可能也属于这类现象。
      “假如两个氢相撞，解放能的十分之一”——这两句话不很正确。两个氢相撞，是属于热撞反应范围，因而最多可以将蕴藏中的能量解放出千分之几。能够有希望将蕴藏在物质中的能量解放出十分之一的，是基本粒子的互相转换、蜕变的现象。两个氢的原子核，也就是质子，在极高的能力的作用下互相碰撞，可以产生基本粒子互相作用的现象的。但是由文字和内容看来，诗的作者可能不是指的这类现象。
    文学作品内的科学内容本来不一定要太严格，但若能将这些基本观念弄清楚，将内容改几个字，仍然可以保存原来的诗的意义。
    我们还是欢迎文学家们关心科学活动，小的错误不要太紧张。
    此致敬礼
                                    钱三强
    ·方纪同志的信·编辑同志：
    读了转来钱三强同志的信，十分高兴。难得他注意到了这样两首不成样子的小诗。我的科学知识，原本极其有限，尤其对于这种尖端科学。这次在北京，去参观了原子能研究所，对于我们在最新尖端科学上迅速取得的成就，十分感奋，于是写了那样两首小诗。但因为究竟是一时的印象，有些科学概念没有彻底弄清楚，不免说了外行话。这比之科学家对于文学的关心来，真是十分惭愧！我们生活在原子时代，做的又是文化工作，科学知识不足，是一个大缺陷。钱三强同志这种对文学的关怀，真该使得我们要去学一点科学了。请便中转致我对钱三强同志的谢意。敬礼！
                                  方　纪
            ·编者的话·
    我们发表钱三强同志和方纪同志的信，目的还不只是在补正“原子能两首”中的一些缺陷。我们深深感到：诗人努力去表现新的科学技术的题材，科学家热情地关心文学活动，这事只有我们这时代才能出现，是一件可喜可贺的事。
    人民群众要求作家在文学作品里表现我们的一日千里的时代，作家也满腔热情地去投入沸腾的生活。在这样的关头，自然不可避免地要遇到许多崭新的东西，崭新的问题。毛泽东同志在十年前就指出：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”我们的作家们，熟悉战争，熟悉土地改革和合作化，而对于现代工业建设、对现代科学技术，就不是那么熟悉了。然而，一个立志要写出无愧于我们这时代的作品的作家，又怎能回避这些崭新的事物呢？
    钱三强同志说“欢迎文学家们关心科学活动”，方纪同志说“我们要去学一点科学”，我们觉得，对读者来说，这是一个好消息；对我们的社会主义文学事业来说，也是一个好消息。
