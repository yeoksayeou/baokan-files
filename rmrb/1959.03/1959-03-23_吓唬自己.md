Notes

    Scaring Oneself
    Recently, the United States has been clamoring for war, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has even held naval exercises. Adenauer also couldn't resist joining in, conducting so-called psychological warfare exercises in Demang, West Germany. All of this is merely an attempt to create an atmosphere of tension in order to salvage their embarrassing situation regarding the West Berlin issue.
    But what will this achieve other than scaring themselves? West Germany's psychological warfare exercise is a ridiculous example. The exercise was conducted without prior notice to local residents, and planes were dispatched to scatter leaflets in large numbers, saying that "the victorious Red Army is advancing forward, breaking through all obstacles, and refugees are being shot at by Adenauer's police 'like mad dogs.'" As a result, local residents were "greatly shocked" after picking up the leaflets. Of course, they were not shocked by the lies of the so-called "Red Army" "advancing," because such lies are self-defeating. The people of West Germany, however, can see from this the long shadow of the impending disaster of West German militarism.

### 吓唬自己

    吓唬自己
    最近美国发动战争叫嚣，北大西洋集团还举行海军演习。阿登纳也少不了来一番配合，在西德的德芒市进行所谓心理战演习。这一切无非想借此制造紧张空气，以挽救它们在西柏林问题上的狼狈处境。
    但这除了吓唬他们自己以外，会有什么结果呢？西德的心理战演习，就是一个可笑的例子。这次演习事先并没有通知当地居民，就出动飞机大批散发传单，说什么“胜利的红军正在破除一切障碍向前挺进，难民正在被阿登纳警察‘像疯狗一样’开枪打死。”结果当地居民捡到传单后，“大为震惊”。他们震惊的当然不是所谓“红军”“挺进”的谎言，因为这种谎言不戳自穿。西德人民倒是可以由此看到拖得长长的西德军国主义灾难的阴影。
