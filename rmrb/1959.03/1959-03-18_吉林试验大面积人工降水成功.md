    Jilin Successfully Experiments with Large-Scale Artificial Precipitation

    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 17th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force recently successfully experimented with large-scale artificial precipitation in Jilin Province. A single flight can benefit an area of 200 square kilometers with a precipitation amount of 1.2 millimeters.

    This unit, in close collaboration with the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, the Jilin Meteorological Department, and other units, successfully experimented with artificial precipitation last year. However, at that time, the dry ice spreading device was not fully automated, resulting in low precipitation efficiency and a small benefited area. This year, based on the original experience, the unit adopted a new dry ice spreading device and a semi-automatic ice crushing device. This equipment is installed on the aircraft, carrying 1,600 to 1,800 kilograms of ice, and can produce 1.2 millimeters of precipitation over an area of 200 square kilometers in a single operation.

    吉林试验大面积人工降水成功
    新华社长春17日电　人民解放军空军某部最近在吉林省试验大面积人工降水成功。单机每次飞行降水的受益面积可达二百平方公里，降水量为一点二公厘。
    这个部队去年曾经和吉林肥料厂、吉林气象部门等单位紧密协作，试验人工降水成功。但当时由于干冰撒布装置没有达到自动化，降水效率不高，受益面积不大。今年，这个部队又在原有经验的基础上，采用了新的干冰撒布装置和半自动化碎冰装置。把这种设备安装在飞机上，载冰一千六百到一千八百公斤，一次就可以在二百平方公里范围内降水一点二公厘。
