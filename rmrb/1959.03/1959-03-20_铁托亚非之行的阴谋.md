Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 19th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Agricultural Banner" recently published an article refuting Tito's slanders and libels against the leaders of Bulgaria and Albania in his speech in Skopje.

The article said that in his speech, Tito shamelessly used all kinds of insulting adjectives to abuse the leaders of Bulgaria and Albania. He fabricated rumors that they had made speeches inciting war. The article asked, who made such a speech and when? Who used war to intimidate Yugoslavia in that speech? The article continued: Indeed, there have been speeches against Yugoslav revisionism in the past, and there will be in the future. Comrade Hoxha did indeed deliver a speech in Tirana not long ago criticizing the splitters in the international communist movement. But what does this speech have in common with "inciting war"? What does a speech defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and safeguarding the unity of the working class have to do with "war mongering"? There is and cannot be anything in common! Because the struggle against revisionism is actually a positive struggle for peace.

The article pointed out that the reason why Tito confused the struggle against revisionism with so-called "inciting war" is because he has no reason, no arguments, and no facts to defend the bankrupt arguments of the splitters. Because he is trying to divert the attention of the Yugoslav people to another angle, in order to stir up feelings that are favorable to him and his partners, so that they can use them to show their gratitude to imperialism.

### 铁托亚非之行的阴谋

    铁托亚非之行的阴谋：一、企图离间亚非国家同社会主义国家的友谊，二、为美帝国主义的利益效劳，三、使亚非国家离开万隆原则，四、传播反共“经验”。但是这些阴谋都遭到了可耻的失败。
    新华社索非亚19日电　保加利亚“农业旗帜报”最近发表文章，驳斥铁托在斯科普里的演说中对保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚领导人的污蔑和诽谤。
    文章说，铁托在他的演说中十分放肆地用尽各种侮辱性的形容词来辱骂保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的领导人，他造谣说他们发表了挑拨战争的演说。文章问道，是谁在什么时候发表过这种演说？是谁在那一次演说中用战争恫吓过南斯拉夫？文章接着写道：的确，反对南斯拉夫修正主义的演说过去有过，而且将来还会有。霍查同志不久前在地拉那的确发表过批判国际共产主义运动中的分裂分子的演说。但这个演说和“挑拨战争”之间有什么共同之处？维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、捍卫工人阶级的团结的演说同“战争挑拨”有什么相干？没有而且不可能有任何共同之处！因为，反对修正主义的斗争其实就是争取和平的积极斗争。
    文章指出，铁托所以把反对修正主义的斗争同所谓“挑拨战争”混为一谈，是因为他没有理由，没有论据，没有事实来为分裂分子的已经破了产的论据辩解。因为他企图把南斯拉夫人民的注意力转移到另一个角度上去，以煽起有利于他和他的伙伴们的感情，从而可以使他们用来向帝国主义感恩戴德。
