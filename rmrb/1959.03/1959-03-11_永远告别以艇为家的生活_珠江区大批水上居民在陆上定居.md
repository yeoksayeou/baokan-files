Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: A large number of waterfront residents in Guangzhou's Pearl River District have moved to settle on land, ending their lives of living on the water and in boats for generations over thousands of years. According to recent statistics, more than 5,000 households of waterfront residents have moved to land, and the remaining 5,000 households will all be relocated this year.

The work of assisting waterfront residents to settle on land began as early as 1956. At that time, the People's Congress of the Pearl River District passed a resolution: "To build the Pearl River District into a modern water transportation area, and to gradually relocate the waterfront people to live on land." The Party and government leading organs and relevant departments of Guangzhou City attached great importance to this requirement to improve the living conditions of the waterfront people. Over the past two years, the Municipal People's Committee has allocated more than 600,000 yuan in special funds for construction to assist waterfront residents in relocation. The relevant departments have also allocated funds to build three new villages for waterfront residents and a number of waterfront resident dormitories on land.

Recently, with the great leap forward in various production and construction efforts, waterfront residents have basically found employment, and are qualified for large-scale relocation to land. At the same time, according to the needs of urban construction planning, it is also required to assist waterfront residents in relocating more quickly. Therefore, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have specially established a working group to lead this work. In addition to giving priority to waterfront residents when adjusting housing, the municipal housing management department has also begun to build a new batch of waterfront residential houses, including six three-story buildings. The Guangzhou Maritime Bureau and other units, which have a large number of waterfront resident employees, have also adopted methods such as increasing employee dormitories and giving priority to waterfront resident employees to assist the families of employees among waterfront residents to move to land.

Waterfront residents all regard moving to land as a great happy event, and they all express their gratitude to the Party and the government for their kind care. (Attached picture)

    永远告别以艇为家的生活
    珠江区大批水上居民在陆上定居
    新华社广州9日电　广州市珠江区大批水上居民迁移陆上定居，结束了千百年来世世代代以水为乡、以艇为家的生活。据最近统计，已经有五千多户水上居民先后迁居陆上，剩下的五千多户今年内也将全部迁居完毕。
    协助水上居民上陆定居的工作，早在1956年就已经开始了。当时，珠江区人民代表大会通过决议：“把珠江区建设成为现代化的水上运输区，水上人民逐步迁移到陆上居住。”广州市党政领导机关和各有关部门，对这项关系水上人民居住条件改善的要求，很是重视。两年来，市人民委员会先后拨出了专款六十多万元，作为协助水上居民迁居的建设费用。有关部门并先后拨款在陆上建设了三所水上居民新村和一批水上居民宿舍。
    近来，随着各项生产建设大跃进，水上居民已经基本上就业，具备了大规模迁居陆上的条件。同时，根据城市建设规划的需要，也要求较快地协助水上居民迁居。因此，中共广州市委和市人民委员会专门成立了一个工作组，领导这项工作。市房屋管理部门除了在调整房子时优先照顾水上居民以外，并开始再建一批水上居民住宅，其中包括六幢三层楼房。水上居民职工较多的广州海运局、等单位，也都采取增加职工宿舍和优先照顾水上居民职工等办法，协助水上居民中的职工家属移居陆上。
    水上居民都把移居陆上看成一件大喜事，他们同声感谢党和政府对他们的亲切关怀。（附图片）
