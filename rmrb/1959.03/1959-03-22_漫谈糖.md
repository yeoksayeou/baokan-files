    A Casual Discussion of Sugar
    Sugar has a long history in China. As early as the end of the Zhou Dynasty two thousand years ago, people were already drinking sugarcane juice (syrup extracted from sugarcane). For example, in the "Summoning the Soul" chapter of the Chu Ci by Song Yu, there is the line "stewed turtle and roasted lamb with zhe jiang" (meaning that sugar syrup was used to flavor dishes and desserts – the author). By the Jin Dynasty, the method of making cane sugar by hand was mastered; and during the prosperous Tang Dynasty (during the reign of Emperor Taizong, more than 1,300 years ago), sugar production methods gradually spread to the provinces of Sichuan and Guangdong.
    Although China has a long history of indigenous sugar production, its development was slow for a long time before liberation. After liberation, like other industries, the sugar industry has developed rapidly. In 1958, the national sugar output increased more than four times compared to 1949. More than 100 new and expanded large and medium-sized mechanized sugar factories were built, and there are no fewer than tens of thousands of small sugar factories scattered throughout the country.
    Sugar is a carbohydrate, which is not only sweet and palatable, but also an indispensable nutrient for the human body. It is also an indispensable raw material for chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
    At present, the raw materials used for sugar production are mainly sugarcane and sugar beet. Sugar maple, coconut palm, date palm, sweet potato, berry trees, and sugar sorghum can also be used to make sugar, but their sugar content is relatively low.
    Sugarcane, also known as gan zhe, dou zhe, or zhu zhe, belongs to the Gramineae family and is a perennial herbaceous plant. It is abundant in the tropics and subtropics. In China, it is produced in large quantities in the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Taiwan, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Sugarcane has high economic value. In addition to being the main raw material for sugar production, its roots, leaves, bagasse, molasses, and filter mud can all be comprehensively utilized.
    Sugar beet, also known as tian cai or sugar radish, belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family and is a biennial economic crop. Sugar beet has only been in the East for about a century, and it used to be abundant only in colder regions such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia. However, in recent years, under the glorious guidance of the Party's General Line, the working people have broken through years of superstitious constraints and finally succeeded in trial planting sugar beet in the hottest regions of China, such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Hubei. At present, sugar beet cultivation has spread almost throughout the country. Because of the rich sugar content of sugar beet (16 to 18 jin of sugar per 100 jin, and up to 23 jin in some cases), which is similar to that of sugarcane, sugar beet has been used as the main raw material for sugar production in many countries in recent centuries.
    China is located in the subtropical and temperate zones and has unique and abundant conditions for growing sugarcane and sugar beet. Therefore, with the rapid development of China's national economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, under the leadership of the Party, the sugar industry will leap forward at an unprecedented pace.

    漫谈糖
    糖，在我国有悠久的历史。远在二千年前的周朝末叶，人们已饮用蔗浆（甘蔗中榨出的糖浆）了。例如楚词宋玉招魂篇中即有“胹鳖炮羔有柘浆”之句（即做菜和点心时用糖浆来调味的意思——笔者）。到了晋朝，就掌握了手工制蔗糖的方法；及至唐朝的兴盛时期（太宗时，距今一千三百多年），制糖方法逐渐传播于川、广诸省。
    我国土法制糖的历史虽很悠久，但是，解放前长期发展缓慢。解放后，和其他工业一样，制糖工业才有了飞速发展。1958年全国糖产量比1949年增长了四倍以上，新建、扩建的大、中型机械化糖厂一百多个，而遍布各地的小糖厂则不下十几万个。
    糖，是一种碳水化合物，它不仅味甜适口，而且是人体不可缺少的营养品。也是化学和医药等工业不可缺少的原材料。
    目前，用于制糖的原料主要有甘蔗与甜菜两种。糖枫、椰棕、枣棕、红薯、浆果树及糖用高粱等，也可制糖，不过含糖量较少一些。
    甘蔗，又名甘柘、都蔗或诸蔗，属禾本科，是多年生的草本植物，盛产于热带及亚热带，我国南方的广东、广西、福建、四川、江西、台湾、浙江、安徽等省出产甚丰。甘蔗的经济价值很高，除可做制糖的主要原料外，它的根、梢叶、蔗渣、废蜜以及滤泥等都可综合利用。
    甜菜，又称菾菜或糖萝卜，属藜科，是二年生的经济作物，甜菜东来不过百年历史，以往只盛产于黑龙江、吉林及内蒙古等较寒地带。但是，近几年来，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，劳动人民冲破了多年的迷信羁绊，终于在我国最热的广东、江苏和湖北等地试种甜菜成功，目前，甜菜种植几遍及全国。由于甜菜的含糖量丰富（每百斤含糖量十六到十八斤，多的达二十三斤），与甘蔗差不多，近世纪来，在许多国家里，甜菜和甘蔗都被做为制糖的主要原料了。
    我国位于亚热带与温带，具有种植甘蔗和甜菜得天独厚的丰产条件。因此，随着我国国民经济的飞速发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，在党的领导下，制糖工业将一日千里地向前跃进。　（秦馥）
