The "preserve" character in the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" does not mean that we only need to pay attention to it after the crops have grown. We must pay attention to this work before the spring sowing, using less effort to achieve greater results. The prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of overwintering crops should also be carried out as early as possible.

Most kinds of diseases and insect pests hide in soil, weeds, straw, roots, stubble, seed heads, seeds, and warehouses during the winter and spring seasons. Overwintering pests are generally inactive and relatively concentrated, making this the easiest time to eliminate them. Eliminating one insect now is equivalent to eliminating dozens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of insects during crop growth. Preventing and controlling pests on one mu of land now will ensure that dozens or even hundreds of mu of crops are less affected or unaffected during the growing season. This can greatly save labor and pesticides.

From the previous winter to spring, the Jin Southeast region of Shanxi Province seized the overwintering period of diseases and insect pests and fought a major battle throughout the winter and spring, achieving "three zeros" and "five cleans." "Three zeros" means no straw, no root stubble, and no seed heads; "five cleans" means clean homes, clean courtyards, clean villages, clean threshing grounds, and clean fields. During the crop growth process, a series of prevention and control measures were carried out, realizing no insect holes in corn leaves, no insect holes in stalks, and no broken tassels, basically preventing corn borer damage.

This year, many regions have also done a good job in preventing and controlling overwintering diseases and insect pests. For example, Shouzhang County in Shandong Province proposed "working hard for thirty days to wipe out the hosts of diseases and insects." Chen County in Hunan, the Jin Southeast region in Shanxi, and Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui have all launched mass movements to eliminate overwintering diseases and insect pests, and have achieved great results. However, from an overall perspective, the prevention and control of overwintering diseases and insect pests is not balanced enough, and some regions have not paid close attention to this work. The climate was warm last winter and this spring, the mortality rate of overwintering diseases and insect pests was low, and the number of diseases and insects is large. In addition, there has been more rain in many regions this spring, and it is expected that there will still be a large outbreak and epidemic of diseases and insect pests this year. Therefore, we must seize the last moment before overwintering diseases and insect pests begin to move, and before "Grain Rain," in conjunction with the current fertilizer accumulation movement, vigorously carry out mass movements to eliminate overwintering diseases and insect pests, launch a few days of concentrated attacks, completely destroy the lairs of diseases and insect pests, and resolutely eliminate diseases and insect pests in the overwintering stage. This is of extremely important significance for striving for a bumper harvest of crops this year, and it is also a good way to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

In winter wheat and oilseed rape producing areas, in conjunction with the ongoing field management, universally and strictly inspect the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, and eliminate them immediately once discovered. Wheat rust must be eliminated at the focus of the disease to prevent it from spreading.

In rice producing areas, actively take measures such as spring plowing and irrigation, picking up and destroying rice roots, and removing weeds and wild grasses from the edges of fields to completely eliminate pests such as rice borers and rice planthoppers.

In corn and millet producing areas, in conjunction with accumulating fertilizer, composting manure, and storing livestock feed, promptly dispose of straw, root stubble, and seed heads to eliminate overwintering pests such as corn borers and millet gray borers.

In cotton producing areas, mobilize the masses to clean up warehouses storing cotton, eliminate the residue left over from ginning, pick up and destroy cotton bollworms and fallen leaves, and completely eliminate cotton bollworms.

In all regions, seed used for spring sowing must be properly selected, treated with warm water soaking, and treated with pesticides. Seed potatoes used for raising seedlings should also be thoroughly "disinfected."

    “保”字要早抓
    杨显东
    农业“八字宪法”中的“保”字，并不是要到作物生长出来以后才需要注意。在春播以前就要注意这个工作，用较少的力量能得到很大的效果。对于越冬作物的病虫害，也应该及早防治。
    各种病虫害在冬春两季大多数躲藏在土壤、杂草、秸秆、根
  、穗轴、种子、仓库里面过冬。越冬病虫一般不活动，而且比较集中，在这一时期，最容易消灭。现在消灭一个虫就等于作物生长期间消灭几十个虫、几百个虫，甚至几万个虫。现在防治一亩地，就保证生长期间几十亩，甚至几百亩农作物少受害或者不受害。这样就可大大地节省劳动力和农药。
    前冬去春，山西省晋东南地区，抓住病虫害越冬时期，大战一冬一春，做到“三无”、“五净”。“三无”就是无秸秆、无根茬、无穗轴；“五净”就是家里干净、院子干净、村庄干净、谷场干净、田地干净。在作物生长过程中，又进行了一系列的防治工作，实现了玉米叶子无虫孔、茎秆无虫洞、雄穗不折断，基本制止了玉米螟为害。
    今年也有很多地区防治越冬病虫害搞得很好。如山东省寿张县提出“苦干三十天，让病虫寄主一扫光”。湖南郴县、山西晋东南地区、安徽阜阳专区都开展了群众性的消灭越冬病虫害运动，成绩都很大。但从全面情况来看，越冬病虫害防治工作是不够平衡的，有些地区对这项工作抓的不紧。去冬今春气候温暖，越冬病虫害死亡率低，病虫数量很多，加以今春不少地区雨水较多，预计今年病虫害仍有大发生和大流行的可能。因此，必须抓住越冬病虫害尚未开始活动的最后一刻，在“谷雨”以前，结合当前积肥运动，大力开展群众性的消灭越冬病虫害工作，突击几天，彻底捣毁病虫害的老窝，坚决把病虫害消灭在越冬阶段。这对于争取今年农作物大丰收有极其重大的意义，也是在防治病虫害的工作中执行多快好省的工作路线的好办法。
    在冬小麦和油菜产区，要结合正在进行的田间管理，普遍严格地检查病虫发生情况，一旦发现立即消灭。对小麦锈病，必须消灭在发病中心，不使扩大蔓延。
    在水稻产区，要积极采取春耕灌水，拾毁稻根，铲除田边杂草、游草等，彻底消灭水稻螟虫、稻飞虱等害虫。
    在玉米、谷子产区，要结合积肥、沤粪和贮蓄牲畜饲料，及时地处理秸秆、根茬、穗轴，消灭越冬玉米螟、粟灰螟等害虫。
    在棉花产区，要发动群众清扫贮藏棉花的仓库，消灭轧花剩余的残渣，拾毁棉花枯铃落叶，彻底消灭棉花红铃虫。
    在各个地区，春播用的种籽都要做好选种、温汤浸种、药剂拌种等工作。对育苗用的种薯，也要彻底“消毒”。
