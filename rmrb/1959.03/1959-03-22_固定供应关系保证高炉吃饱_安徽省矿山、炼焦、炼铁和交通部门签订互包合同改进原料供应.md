This newspaper reported from Hefei on March 21st: In order to ensure that the furnaces of the province's steel bases are "well-fed" and "eat well," thereby increasing the output and quality of pig iron, the industrial departments of Anhui Province recently convened the leaders of the province's major steel plants, mines, coal mines, coking plants, and transportation departments to specifically study the supply situation of ore, coke, and coking coal throughout the province, and signed contracts to uniformly arrange the supply relationships between mines, coal mines, coking plants, and steel plants.

After vigorously developing the steel industry last year, new supply relationships urgently needed adjustment. Ore from the mining areas on the south bank of the Yangtze River supporting the steel bases north of the river was all concentrated in Yuxi, and then uniformly allocated according to urgency. The ore grades and component contents of each mining area varied, and the places to which they were transported were often changed, making it difficult for blast furnace production to control the batching according to the ore composition. During the dry season, ore from some mining areas could not be transported out, while some blast furnaces could not get the ore they needed in time. Whether in transportation or supply, ore, coke, and coking coal urgently needed unified arrangements to ensure supply and improve iron production and quality. Based on this situation, Anhui Province adopted the following specific measures:

First, establish fixed supply points and implement dual leadership. Supply points are determined according to the size of the tasks of the mines and steel plants, ore quality, transportation, and other conditions. For example, the ore required by the Anhui Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Iron and Steel General Plant is supplied by the Baimashan in Fanchang County, Yeshan in Tongling, and Dagaishan mining area in Qingyang; the steel plant in Hefei City is supplied by the mining areas in Guichi, Lu'ru, and Wuwei; Huainan and Fuyang are supplied by Ma'anshan and Dangtu. The quality, quantity, and time of supply are clearly specified, such as the iron content of the ore must be around 45%, not less than 40%. In order to closely link the steel plants and mining areas, it is determined that the steel plants should send people to participate in the leadership of the mining areas. In this way, the mining areas have clear supply targets and clear production tasks, and the consolidation and improvement of the mining areas are also guaranteed. With ore supply bases, steel plants can easily grasp the ore composition, improve steel quality, and give play to their initiative in helping the construction of mining areas.

Second, sign mutual guarantee contracts for the direct supply of processed coke and ore. The empty train cars returning from Huainan supplying coke to Ma'anshan carry back ore to develop steel production. Mutual support between the two places is beneficial to the development of the steel and coal industries. On this basis, both parties further strengthen the supply relationship and signed mutual guarantee contracts for quality, quantity, and transportation. In the past, the ore and coke mutually supplied by the two places were raw coke and raw ore. Now, Huainan uses the existing local equipment to crush and screen the raw coke, and transports the high-quality coke that meets the specifications to Ma'anshan, which can be directly sent into the blast furnace for iron smelting. Coke powder and ash content are treated locally. Ma'anshan also processes the ore with the existing crushing equipment in the mine, and transports the high-quality ore that meets the specifications to Huainan for direct iron smelting. Ore powder is sintered locally. In this way, not only do both parties get good coke and good ore, but it also greatly saves transportation capacity. This year, the two places will mutually supply a total of more than 960,000 tons of raw coke and raw ore, of which impurities such as ore powder and coke powder account for about 130,000 tons. By leaving these in place for treatment instead of transporting them to the other party, more than 3,000 train cars can be saved this year.

Third, sign transportation contracts, fix transportation tools, and ensure timely supply. In the past, it was difficult for the transportation department to grasp the ore and coke transportation needs of each steel plant, and there was often a phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. Now that the supply points are fixed, the transportation department can arrange transportation tools and labor for highways, waterways, railways, and short-distance transportation according to the contract, and carry out unified combined transportation.

Now, the various steel plants, mining areas, coking plants, and transportation departments have all actively acted according to the contracts. The Huainan City obtained an average of 750 tons of ore per day last month, and now it has reached more than 1,000 tons, ensuring the production supply of the blast furnaces. In the mining areas where ore cannot be transferred out in large quantities during the dry season, they are now also carrying out crash mining with the help of steel plants, preparing sufficient ore for outward transportation during the flood season. Many mining areas have proposed to ensure supply so that the steel base will have a quarter's worth of ore reserves.

    固定供应关系保证高炉吃饱
    安徽省矿山、炼焦、炼铁和交通部门签订互包合同改进原料供应
    本报合肥21日电　为了确保全省钢铁基地的高炉“吃饱粮”“吃好粮”，从而提高生铁的产量和质量，安徽省工业部门最近特召集全省主要钢铁厂、矿山、煤矿、炼焦厂和交通部门的负责人，专门研究了全省矿石、焦炭和炼焦煤的供应情况，并签订合同，统一安排矿山、煤矿、炼焦厂和钢铁厂的供应关系。
    去年在大办钢铁工业后，新的供应关系急需调整。长江南岸各矿区支援江北钢铁基地的矿石，都是集中到裕溪以后，根据缓急，统一调配。各矿区矿石品位高低不一，所含成分不同，调运的地方也常调换，因此高炉生产很难根据矿石成分掌握配料；枯水季节，有些矿区的矿石调运不出，而一些高炉所需的矿石，又不能得到及时供应。矿石、焦炭和炼焦煤不论在运输上、供应上都急需统一安排才能保证供应，提高铁的产量和质量。安徽省根据这一情况，采取了以下的具体办法：
    一、固定供应点，实行双重领导。按矿山和钢铁厂任务大小、矿石质量、交通等条件，确定供应点。如安徽省直属机关钢铁总厂所需的矿石，由繁昌县的白马山、铜陵的叶山、青阳大盖山矿区供应；合肥市的钢铁厂由贵池、庐汝、无为的矿区供应；淮南和阜阳由马鞍山、当涂供应；并明确规定了供应的质量、数量和时间，如矿石含铁成分一定要在45％左右，不低于40％。为了密切钢铁厂和矿区关系，确定钢铁厂要派人参加矿区的领导工作。这样，矿区就有了明确的供应对象，明确的生产任务，矿区的巩固和提高也有了保证。钢铁厂有了矿石供应基地，也易于掌握矿石成分，提高钢铁质量，并能发挥积极性帮助矿区建设。
    二、签订互包合同，直接供应加工后的焦炭和矿石。淮南供应马鞍山焦炭的回空车皮，带回矿石发展钢铁生产，两地互相支援，对发展钢铁和煤炭工业都有好处。在这个基础上，双方进一步加强供应关系，签订了包质、包量、包运输的互包合同。过去两地互相支援的矿石、焦炭，都是原焦、原矿。现在淮南就本地已有设备，把原焦破碎、筛选后，把各合乎规格的好焦，运给马鞍山，就能直接送入高炉炼铁。焦粉、灰分留原地处理。马鞍山也同样就矿山已有的破碎设备加工矿石，把合乎规格的好矿运给淮南直接炼铁。矿粉就地烧结。这样，不仅双方都得到好焦好矿，而且大大节省了运输力量。两地今年互相供应的原焦、原矿共九十六万多吨，其中矿粉，焦炭粉等杂质，约占十三万多吨。把这些留在原地处理，不运给对方，今年将可节省车皮三千多个。
    三、签订运输合同，固定运输工具，保证及时供应。过去交通部门很难掌握各个钢铁厂所需要运输的矿石、焦炭情况，常有顾此失彼现象。现在固定供应点后，交通部门就能根据合同，安排公路、水路、铁路和短途交通的运输工具和劳力，统一进行联运。
    现在各个钢铁厂、矿区、炼焦厂和交通运输部门，已都根据合同积极行动起来，淮南市在上月份每天平均得到矿石七百五十吨，现已达到千吨以上，保证了对高炉的生产供应。在枯水季节矿石不能大量外调的矿区，现在也因得到了钢铁厂帮助，正在突击开采，准备充足的矿石，待涨水期外运。许多矿区都提出要保证供应，使钢铁基地有一个季度的矿石储备。
