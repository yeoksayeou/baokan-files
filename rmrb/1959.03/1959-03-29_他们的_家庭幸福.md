Their “Family Happiness”
	Ma Tieding

Here are two news items:

“In Detroit, USA, a man named George Johnston left a house, a servant, and $15,000 to a three-year-old named Bozo after his death. The deceased wrote in his will that the servant must be responsible for taking care of the heir. Who is this Bozo? It turns out to be a German Shepherd dog.” (Reported by Soviet Culture News)

“According to official U.S. statistics, more than fifteen million Americans live in slums. In some workers' residences in New York, overcrowding has led to people having to sleep in shifts. An economist named Shelby, because of long-term unemployment and nowhere to live, often goes to the subway to doze off after midnight. There is also a homeless old man who has been spending his nights in a crystal coffin of a French king in the New York City Museum for the past ten years.” (Reported by the U.S. People's World)

Since last winter, many foolish people in the United States have been trying in vain to slander our people’s Great Leap Forward and the People’s Communes as destroying and breaking up families, as if American families are "complete and happy."

However, look, in the United States, the families of George Johnstons and dogs like Bozo do indeed have happiness. As for the people in the slums, the workers who sleep in "shifts," the people who spend their nights in the subway and crystal coffins… their families have long been destroyed and broken up. All the vicious curses of the rumor experts, applied to the United States, are perfectly suitable and very appropriate.

American imperialists not only destroy the families of millions of people in their own country, but wherever their power reaches, they play a destructive role.

Here, I cannot help but think of Taiwan.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is currently engaged in some "Happy Family Movement." We are all Chinese people, and we hope that our compatriots in Taiwan will have a happy family. However, the family happiness of the Taiwan compatriots has already been subjected to, and continues to be subjected to, the destruction of American imperialists. There are legislative members who have been killed by American military jeeps, and innocent women who have been raped to death by American soldiers. The Taiwan Keelung "Oriental Daily" once published the following news: "‘U.S. military pleasure gardens,’ military brothels, have been established in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other places. Many Taiwanese women are imprisoned inside, including some girls as young as fourteen or fifteen years old."

Who doesn't have a wife and children? Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have a family? Who wasn't born of a mother and father? With no guarantee of life while walking on the street, and wives and daughters being insulted and ravaged, what "happiness" can there be?! We know clearly, and our compatriots in Taiwan, who are experiencing it firsthand, know even more clearly: as long as the American imperialists do not get out of the Taiwan region, the so-called "happy family" is all worthless nonsense!

Only in the regions under the leadership of the Chinese People's Government can there be true happy families, family happiness. This kind of happiness has never been seen since the beginning of time!

Who is destroying families, destroying the family happiness of millions of people? It is the American imperialists and their running dogs. Isn’t this an obvious and undeniable fact?

    他们的“家庭幸福”
    马铁丁
    有新闻两则如下：
    “美国底特律城有个叫乔治·约翰斯顿的，死后留给三岁的布佐一所房子、一个仆人和一万五千美元。死者在遗嘱上写着，仆人必须负责照拂继承人。这布佐是谁呢？原来是一只日耳曼种的牧羊狗。”（苏维埃文化报载）
    “据美国官方统计，有一千五百多万美国人住在贫民窟中。在纽约的一些工人住宅，由于过份拥挤，以致不得不轮班睡觉。有一个名叫谢尔比的经济学者因为长期失业，无处栖身，常在深夜十二时后到地下火车去打瞌睡。还有一个无家可归的老头儿，十年来一直在纽约市立博物馆中一个法国国王的水晶棺材中过夜。”（美国人民世界报载）
    美国的许多蠢人们，去年冬天以来，曾经枉费心机地污蔑我国人民的大跃进、人民公社破坏和拆散了家庭。仿佛它美国的家庭是“圆满幸福的”。
    然而，请看吧，在美国，乔治·约翰斯顿们的家庭，以及布佐之类的狗，的确是有幸福；至于贫民窟里的人、“轮班”睡觉的工人们、在地下火车和水晶棺材中过夜的人，……他们的家庭早就被破坏、被拆散了。造谣专家们的一切恶毒诅咒，用在它美国，正好头寸合适，十分恰当。
    美帝国主义者不但在本国破坏千千万万人的家庭，而且它的势力到哪里，就在哪里起着破坏作用。
    在这里，我不禁想起台湾。
    台湾蒋介石集团最近正在搞什么“幸福家庭运动”。咱们都是中国人，咱们多么希望台湾的同胞们都有一个幸福的家庭。可是，台湾同胞们的家庭幸福，早已遭受到、并在继续不断地遭受到美帝国主义者的破坏。有被美军吉普车撞死的立法委员，有被美军强奸致死的良家妇女。台湾基隆“东方日报”还曾经登过这样的消息：“在台北市、高雄市等地都设立了‘美军乐园’军妓院，许多台湾妇女被囚禁在里面，其中包括一些只有十四、五岁的女童”。
    谁无妻女？谁无父母？谁无家庭？谁不是爷娘生的？走路生命没有保障，妻女受人侮辱和蹂躏，有什么“幸福”可言？！我们清楚，身历其境的台湾同胞更清楚：只要美帝国主义者一天不滚出台湾地区去，所谓“幸福家庭”云云，全都是一文不值的废话！
    只有中国人民政府领导下的地区，才有真正的幸福家庭，家庭幸福。这种幸福是盘古开天辟地以来，所未曾有过！
    谁在破坏家庭、破坏千千万万人的家庭幸福？是美帝国主义者及其走狗们，难道不是事实昭昭、有目共睹吗？
