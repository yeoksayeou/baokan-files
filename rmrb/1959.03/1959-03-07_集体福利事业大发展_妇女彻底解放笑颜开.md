Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Since the people's commune movement, a great number of nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens, maternity hospitals and other collective welfare undertakings have been established throughout the country, enabling women, who have been confined to stoves for thousands of years, to be thoroughly liberated and smile with joy.

According to preliminary statistics from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, there are currently more than 4.98 million nurseries and kindergartens across the country, caring for more than 67.7 million children. In general, the percentage of children attending nurseries in provinces and counties reaches more than 70% of the total number of pre-school children, and in some cases more than 90%. The vast majority of these childcare organizations were established during the people's commune movement. Shandong Province currently has more than 300,000 nurseries, kindergartens, and breastfeeding rooms, more than three times the number before communization.

The Party, the government, and the people's communes have done tremendous work to run childcare organizations well. Welfare offices or childcare and education committees have been established at all levels to strengthen the leadership of childcare organizations. A large number of childcare workers have received specialized training. In Shandong Province, more than 79,000 nursery workers and educators received training in teaching methods, diet and hygiene, and organizational management last winter and this spring; in Henan Province, more than 70% of childcare workers have received specialized training. Teachers and students from many normal schools for kindergarten teachers go to the countryside or tour the communes to hold training classes to train childcare workers. The Ningxia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China also held training classes for commune party committee secretaries, chairmen, welfare ministers, women's federation cadres, and heads of childcare organizations on how to run childcare organizations well. A large number of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and outstanding women have been transferred to do childcare work. Through these tremendous efforts, childcare organizations in various places have made great progress in teaching management and child care. Many childcare organizations have established links with local hospitals and health stations, and doctors conduct regular health guidance and check-ups. In Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, every child in care has a health record. The children receive meticulous care and are generally more lively and healthier.

By the end of last December, there were more than 2.89 million public canteens established across the country. Generally, the number of farming households participating in the canteens reaches 90% of the total number of local farming households, and in many cases 100%. According to survey materials from Lushan County, Henan Province, after the establishment of public canteens, each cook can generally cook for 45 people, while in the past, one household had one stove, and one woman cooked for an average of only four or five people. Obviously, this is a huge saving in labor. Many places have recently trained cooks specifically for public canteens. Xingguo and 15 other counties and cities in Jiangxi Province trained more than 1,700 cooks at one time. Taiyuan City has trained nearly 6,000 cooks. Some places have also held representative meetings of activists among cooks. Through training classes and representative meetings of activists, the cooks enthusiastically discussed how to better establish the idea of serving commune members and do this noble work conscientiously; at the same time, they widely exchanged experiences and invited chefs with cooking experience to impart their skills on the spot, which greatly improved the work of the canteens and was enthusiastically supported by the masses.

In addition, according to incomplete statistics, more than 150,000 rural maternity hospitals have also been established across the country, providing good care for mothers and infants.

The development of these collective welfare undertakings has freed the broad masses of women from the burden of trivial housework and made them a huge force in China's socialist construction. According to preliminary statistics from Zhejiang and Shandong provinces, more than 4 million women in each province were freed from housework last year and participated in production with peace of mind. In the past, less than half of the female labor force in the Xilaozhuang Production Team of the Changcheng People's Commune in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, attended work; after the establishment of childcare organizations and public canteens, all women with the ability to work have participated in production. Yao Zhongqing, a woman from Songcun, Wendeng County, has three children and could not work in the fields in the past. Her mother-in-law and husband did not respect her very much. Since the children were enrolled in the nursery and the public canteen was established, she worked more than 280 workdays last year and became a well-known labor model in the commune.

    集体福利事业大发展
    妇女彻底解放笑颜开
    新华社6日讯　人民公社化运动以来，全国各地创办了以数百万计的托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂、妇产院等集体福利事业，使几千年来屈伏在锅灶旁边的妇女得到了彻底的解放而笑逐颜开。
    据二十七个省、市、自治区的初步统计，目前全国各地举办的托儿所、幼儿园有四百九十八万多处，受托儿童六千七百七十万多人。一般省、县入托儿童都达到学龄前儿童总数70％以上，有的达到90％以上。这些托儿组织绝大部分是在人民公社化运动中建立的。山东省目前有托儿所、幼儿园、哺乳室等三十多万处，比公社化以前增加了两倍多。
    党、政府和人民公社为办好托儿组织，进行了巨大的工作。各地层层建立起了福利办公室或托儿保育委员会，加强对托儿组织的领导。大批保育工作者受到了专门的训练。山东省去冬今春受到有关教养方法、饮食卫生、组织管理等方面训练的保育员、教养员有七万九千多名；河南省已经有70％以上的保育工作者受过专门训练。许多幼稚师范学校的师生下乡或巡回到公社举办训练班，培养保育人员。中共宁夏自治区委员会还为公社党委书记、社长、福利部长、妇联干部以及托儿组织的负责人举办了怎样办好托儿组织的训练班。大批共产党员、共青团员和优秀妇女被调去做保育工作。经过这些巨大工作，各地托儿组织在教养管理和儿童保健方面都有了很大进步。许多托儿组织同当地医院、保健站建立联系，由医生定期进行卫生指导和健康检查。河北省高阳县的入托儿童，每人都有健康档案。孩子们受到无微不至的关怀，一般都更加活泼、健壮了。
    全国各地建立的公共食堂，到去年12月底止，共有二百八十九万多处。参加食堂的农户一般都达到当地农户总数的90％，多的达到100％。据河南省鲁山县的调查材料，建立公共食堂后，每个炊事员一般可以做四十五个人的饭，而过去一家一灶，一个妇女平均只做四、五口人的饭。显然，这是劳动力上的巨大节省。许多地方最近都专门为公共食堂训练了炊事员。江西省兴国等十五个县市一次就训练了一千七百多名炊事员。太原市已训练了近六千名炊事员。还有些地方举行了炊事员积极分子代表会议。通过训练班和积极分子代表会议，炊事员们热烈地讨论了如何更好地树立为社员服务的思想，认真做好这件崇高的工作；同时普遍交流经验，请有烹调经验的厨师实地传授技术，大大改进了食堂工作，得到了广大群众的热烈拥护。
    此外，据不完全统计，全国还建立了十五万多处农村产院，使产妇和婴儿得到良好的照顾。
    这些集体福利事业的发展，使广大妇女群众摆脱了繁琐家务的牵累，成为我国社会主义建设事业中一支巨大的生力军。据浙江、山东两省初步统计，去年两省各有四百多万名妇女摆脱家务，安心地参加了生产。山东诸城县昌城人民公社西老庄生产队，过去妇女劳动力出勤不到半数，建立托儿组织和公共食堂后，有劳动条件的妇女已全部参加了生产。文登县宋村妇女姚仲卿有三个孩子，过去不能下地劳动，婆母和丈夫都不大尊重她，自从孩子入托和建立公共食堂后，去年一年她做了二百八十多个劳动日，成了公社中有名的劳动模范。（附图片）
