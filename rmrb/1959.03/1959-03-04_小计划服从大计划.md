Small Plans Subordinate to Big Plans
Chen Pu

The simultaneous emphasis on self-sufficient production and commodity production is one of the important principles for the development of production in people's communes. Recently, people's communes in various regions have been arranging their annual production plans based on this principle.

Under the socialist system, economic activity is an organically integrated whole. No people's commune can carry out production and consumption in isolation, nor can it be completely self-sufficient. If people's communes do not develop commodity production, they will not be able to meet the country's huge demand for agricultural products, nor will they be able to promote the development of the communes' own production and improve the lives of commune members. This principle is now widely known. However, can the above-mentioned goals be achieved by developing commodity production in just any way? No. Commodity production in people's communes is socialist commodity production, fundamentally different from the blindly competitive capitalist commodity production. It must be developed in a planned way. To enable the commodity production of people's communes to develop healthily and prosperously, it is first necessary to solve an important problem: making commodity production subordinate to the state plan. At present, the commodity production plans of people's communes require that some items be formulated directly in accordance with the requirements of the state's planned targets, while other items are combined with the state commercial departments' purchase and sales plans through contracts. Of course, when formulating plans, people's communes must also combine subordination to the state plan with the principle of adapting to local conditions. They must take into account the specific needs and specific conditions of the commune itself, and give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm, while meeting the needs of the state.

Cash crops are the agricultural products with the strongest commodity nature. There is no question that the production of cash crops must be accelerated with the great leap forward in grain production. However, the development of various cash crop production should also be based on the needs of the country and its own specific circumstances, distinguishing between what is important, what is urgent, and what is less so. Various cash crops have their uses and are therefore needed by the country and the people; however, the situation regarding needs is not the same. Some needs are greater and more urgent, while others are not so great or so urgent. Therefore, the state must make unified arrangements, and the people's communes must produce in a planned way. If production lacks unified arrangements, and the production of a certain product is excessive, then efforts to produce other products will inevitably be relaxed, and the needs of the country and the people for these products cannot be met. This is also unfavorable to the people's communes themselves. From any perspective, people's communes must subordinate their small plans to the state's big plan.

Spring plowing has already begun in a few areas, and spring plowing will soon begin successively in most areas. It is necessary for all people's communes to take hold of the production plan for the whole year. Plans that have already been made should be checked to see if they are adapted to the requirements of the state plan; if there are any incompatibilities, they should be revised quickly. Production plans that have not yet been finalized should be finalized based on the principle of combining subordination to the state plan with adapting to local conditions. The implementation of the production plan is a major matter for all commune members. Of course, whether it is formulating or revising plans, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to fully discuss, so that everyone can understand the close relationship between the commune and the country from the plan, understand the basis and necessity for completing the plan, and understand what methods and attitudes to use to complete the plan. In this way, the sense of responsibility, initiative, and confidence of the commune members in realizing the production plan can be greatly strengthened.

    小计划服从大计划
    陈浦
    自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，是人民公社发展生产的重要原则之一。最近，各地人民公社都在根据这个原则安排本年度生产计划。
    社会主义制度下的经济活动是一个有机结合的整体，任何一个人民公社都不可能孤立地进行生产和消费，都不可能自给自足。人民公社如果不发展商品生产，就不能满足国家对农业产品的巨大需要，也不能促进公社本身生产的发展，促进社员生活的改善。这个道理现在已是人所共知的了。但是，是不是随便怎样发展商品生产，都能实现上述的目的呢？不是的。人民公社的商品生产，是社会主义的商品生产，它根本不同于那种盲目竞争的资本主义商品生产，它必须有计划地发展。要使人民公社的商品生产健康地发展起来，繁荣起来，首先必须解决一个重要问题，就是使商品生产服从国家计划。目前人民公社的商品生产计划，有些项目必须直接依照国家规定的计划指标的要求制订，有些项目是通过合同与国家商业部门的购销计划结合起来。当然，人民公社在制订计划的时候，还要把服从国家计划同因地制宜的原则结合起来，要在适应国家的需要的条件下，照顾公社本身的具体需要和具体条件，充分发挥积极性和主动性。
    经济作物是商品性最强的农产品。经济作物必须随着粮食生产的跃进而加速发展，这是没有问题的。但是，发展各种经济作物生产，也要根据国家的需要和本身的具体情况，分别轻重缓急。各种经济作物都有它们的用处，因而也都为国家和人民所需要；但是，同是需要，情况可不一样。有些需要多而迫切，有些需要就不那么多，也不那么迫切。因此，必须由国家来统一安排，由人民公社有计划地来生产。倘若生产缺乏统一安排，某项产品生产过多，那末，必然放松对其他产品生产的努力，因而国家和人民对这些产品的需要就无法满足。这样做，对于人民公社本身也是不利的。不论从哪方面看，人民公社都必须使自己的小计划服从国家的大计划。
    现在少数地区春耕已经开始了，多数地区的春耕也很快要陆续开始，各个人民公社都有必要把全年生产计划抓起来。计划已经订了的，应当加以检查，看看是否同国家计划的要求相适应；如有不相适应之处，应当赶快修订。生产计划还没有最后确定的，应当根据服从国家计划和因地制宜相结合的原则，把计划定下来。执行生产计划是全体社员的大事，不论是制订或是修订计划，当然都应当发动群众充分讨论，使大家从计划上了解公社和国家的密切关系，了解完成计划的根据和必要性，了解用什么办法、什么态度来完成计划。这样，就能大大加强社员群众对于实现生产计划的责任感、积极性和信心。
