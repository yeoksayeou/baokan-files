    Working Together with Courage and Resourcefulness
    Chen Baohe, Li Jianguo, and Wang Yunqing Exceed the "Thousand Machine-Hour" Target

    According to the Qingdao Daily, three young workers from the seventh planing group of the third workshop of the Qingdao Machinery Factory—Chen Baohe (Class A), Li Jianguo (Class B), and Wang Yunqing (Class C)—worked diligently and cleverly in the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement, completing nearly two months' worth of work in twenty days, all while maintaining quality standards.

    In this workshop, each machine tool was required to complete 586 work hours per month. Now, with the "Thousand Machine-Hour" target, each machine tool is expected to complete 1,000 work hours per month, nearly doubling the workload. The three young men in the planing group were excited and thought, "We must double it!" After discussing it, they nominated Wang Yunqing to represent them, guaranteeing that they would complete 1,000 work hours per month, strive for 1,500, and ensure no quality, personal injury, or equipment accidents occurred.

    After the meeting, the three of them raced against each other, their eyes and hands glued to the machine tools, barely uttering a word. After working for a few days, they felt so tired that their backs ached, their legs were sore, and they were completely exhausted. They realized that they could not possibly reach 1,000 work hours by simply relying on brute force, so they recalled what the Party branch secretary had said: "We must work hard but also cleverly, and we must engage in technical revolution. Simply relying on physical strength is not enough." That's right! We must delve into the tools and equipment. One day, they received an order for 29 crane gear couplings (internal gears). According to the quota, it took eight hours to plane one, but the factory's Great Leap Forward target required them to plane one in three hours, totaling 87 work hours. This was an urgent task. With such urgency, it would be impossible to complete the task if they used the old method of first cutting with a cutting tool and then planing with a template tool. So, they carefully considered every movement of the machine and finally decided to eliminate the cutting tool and complete the process in one go with the template tool, while also increasing the speed of the machine. This approach proved to be both fast and effective, and they completed the task in just 26 work hours. This successful improvement made them value technical revolution even more and strengthened their confidence. A few days later, they received an order for 32 crane iron plates. They improved the tools again and completed the task in just nine work hours. The newly modified tools proved to be remarkably effective. For the sand mixer discharge door, which used to take three work hours per piece, they used the newly modified tools and increased the machine speed, completing the task of 16 work hours in just two and a half work hours.

    The three of them were like relay runners in the movement, caring for, encouraging, and promoting each other. For batch orders, they would compete on output between shifts, collectively brainstorm, and teach each other experiences and methods. For small tasks, they would divide the work, "determine the tasks," and "schedule the time," and each would strive for breakthroughs. Exchanging experiences became an indispensable part of their daily activities. On Sundays, the three of them would gather together, studying even more enthusiastically, sometimes even forgetting to eat.

    By the middle of the month, their machine tool had already completed 1,000 work hours. Now, they have set even newer goals, aiming to guarantee 1,500 work hours and strive for 2,000 for the entire month. As of the 20th, their machine tool had already completed 1,090 work hours, which is close to completing two months' worth of work compared to the workshop's planned 586 work hours, and even more than the quota for eight people during this period, and the quality all met the standards.

### 同心协力　有勇有谋  陈宝和李建国王云庆突破“千台时”指标

    同心协力　有勇有谋
    陈宝和李建国王云庆突破“千台时”指标
    据青岛日报消息　青岛机械厂三车间刨工七组的三个青年工人——陈宝和（甲班）、李建国（乙班）、王云庆（丙班），在“千台时”运动中苦干巧干，二十天完成了近两个月的工作量，质量都符合标准。
    这个车间一台机床一个月要完成五百八十六个工时的活，现在提出“千台时”，就是一台机床一个月要完成一千个工时的活，将近翻一番。刨工七组三个青年小伙子心里热呼呼的想：“一定要翻一番！”三人一商议，推选王云庆上台：保证一个月完成一千个工时的活，争取一千五，不发生任何质量、人身、设备事故。
    会后，三个人你追我赶，手眼不离机床，连话也不多说一句。干了几天，直累得腰酸腿疼，浑身没劲。他们感到这样干下去怎么也拼不出一千个工时的活，于是想起了党支部书记的话：“要苦干也要巧干，要大闹技术革命，光拼体力是不行的。”对！要从刀具、工具上钻一钻。一天，他们接到吊车齿轮联接器（内齿轮）二十九个，按定额是八小时刨一个，厂里跃进指标要求三小时刨一个，得八十七个工时，这是急活，等着用。活这样急，像过去先用割刀切一次再用样板刀刨，根本是完不成的。于是他们把机器的每一个动作都考虑几遍，最后决定不用割刀，用样板刀一刀攻下来，并把车速加快了。这样做果然又快又好，结果只用了二十六个工时就完成了任务。这次改进成功，使他们对大闹技术革命更重视了，信心也更强了。过了几天，他们又接到吊车铁板活三十二个，他们又改进工具，一共用了九个工时就完成任务。新改的刀具真是百试百灵，做混砂机出砂门的活，以前三个工时一个，他们使用了新改的刀具，并提高了车速，十六个工时的活只用两个半工时就做完了。
    他们三个人在运动中就像接力赛跑的运动员一样，互相关心、加油、促进。如果是成批的活，就班班比产量，集体动脑筋，互相教经验教办法。零星的任务，就三个人分工“定活”、“定时”，各个突破。交流经验成了他们日常不可缺少的活动。星期天，三个人凑在一起，那就研究得更起劲，有时连饭也顾不得吃。
    到月中的时候，他们这台机床已经干了一千个工时的工作量。现在，他们又提出了更新的奋斗目标，全月要保证完成一千五百个工时的工作量，争取两千。到20日止，他们这台机床已完成了一千零九十个工时的工作量，和车间订的五百八十六个工时的计划比较，接近完成两个月的工作量，比八个人在这期间的工时定额还多，并且质量都符合标准。（附图片）
