    Unclear Explanation

    The report "Between the Couple" on page 3 of the February 22nd People's Daily did not clearly state whether it was about domestic or foreign affairs. The article only mentions "Premier Kim Il-sung came to inspect this factory." Judging from the tone, it is a report about North Korea. I hope that when publishing foreign reports in the future, the explanation will be clearer.

    交代不清
    2月22日人民日报第三版“他们夫妇之间”这篇报道，没有写清楚是国内的事还是国外的事。在文章里仅提到“金日成首相来这个工厂视察”。从语气上看，是关于朝鲜的报道。希望今后发表国外报道时，交代得清楚些。
