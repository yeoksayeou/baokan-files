(I)
    Under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the technological revolution and the cultural revolution are flourishing with the tremendous upsurge of industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, while the Chinese people made a great leap forward in production, they also achieved great success in cultural and technical learning. However, it must be recognized that China's current cultural and technical level is relatively backward and cannot meet the needs of high-speed economic construction. Moreover, the further development of national industrialization, communal industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification makes it all the more urgent to improve the cultural and technical level of the masses. Striving to improve the cultural, technical, and scientific knowledge level of the broad masses of the people is a necessary condition for accelerating China's socialist construction, and it is also to gradually eliminate the difference between manual and mental labor, and to prepare the necessary conditions for further transition to communism in the future.
    In the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, the youth of our country are the most active and vigorous shock force. Young people are in a period of growth, with a strong desire for knowledge and progress. The Party hopes to cultivate the younger generation into a new generation with communist consciousness and modern cultural and scientific knowledge. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Communist Youth League calls on the organizations of the Communist Youth League at all levels to organize and lead the youth's learning with great enthusiasm while leading the youth to engage in large-scale production activities, and to continuously improve the political consciousness and cultural and technical level of the youth of our country. This is a glorious task with strategic significance for the Communist Youth League organizations.
                (II)
    China has 130 million young people, distributed on various fronts such as factories, mines, rural areas, and schools. Currently, more than 10 million young people are studying in full-time and part-time schools at all levels. In the future, these schools will have a relatively large development, and they are an important base for cultivating various talents for the socialist construction of the motherland. However, under China's current conditions, more than 90 percent of young people are in industrial and agricultural production and other work positions. Therefore, it is necessary to conscientiously organize spare-time learning in order to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of the broad masses of young people so that they can better serve the socialist cause. The Communist Youth League organizations must attach great importance to this work.
    Experience in recent years, especially the experience in 1958, has proved that it is not only necessary but also entirely possible for young people in production positions to use their spare time to study. In 1958, a total of 36 million young illiterates were eliminated nationwide, and more than 50 million young people participated in Red and Expert Schools and various spare-time schools. Great achievements have also been made in the study of philosophy by workers and peasants and the reading movement carried out in cities. Many worker and peasant youths, after adhering to several years of spare-time study, have made better achievements in production because of improved political, cultural and technical level. Learning and production, as long as they are properly arranged, can promote each other. The great leap forward in production has powerfully stimulated the youth's desire for knowledge and learning enthusiasm; and the improvement of the youth's political, cultural, and technical level is conducive to the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity. The interwoven development of the labor upsurge and the learning upsurge among the broad masses of young people has become an important component of the upsurge of socialist construction in our country.
    Of course, in a considerable period in the future, especially during the three years of hard work, production labor will still be very intensive. When organizing youth spare-time learning, it is inappropriate to be overly demanding about spare-time learning if this situation is not taken into account. But it is also wrong to only focus on production and ignore learning, thinking that spare-time learning is irrelevant. At present, the conditions for organizing youth spare-time learning are very good. First, the Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over various undertakings of the cultural revolution; second, after rural areas have been communalized, it is easier to make unified arrangements for the time for labor, rest and learning; and finally, not only has the learning enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people been unprecedentedly high, but the strength and experience in organizing spare-time teaching have also increased. As long as we are good at using these conditions, we can assist the Party in organizing youth spare-time learning better.
              (III)
    The "Instructions on Educational Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council in September 1958 proposed that efforts should be made to ensure that, within about fifteen years, all young people and adults throughout the country who have the conditions and are willing can receive higher education. This grand goal should become the program of action for all the League organizations to organize youth spare-time learning.
    Eliminating illiteracy is the first step in the cultural revolution. Great achievements have been made in eliminating illiteracy in 1958, but they are not yet consolidated, and many cases of relapse into illiteracy have already occurred. At the same time, a considerable number of young people are still in a state of illiteracy or semi-literacy. Any complacency and slackness in this regard are harmful. The whole League should continue to work hard, strictly in accordance with the standards for eliminating illiteracy, and strive to complete the task of eliminating youth illiteracy in two years or a little more, and gradually promote Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and putonghua.
    For young people who have already gotten rid of illiteracy, they should be organized to further improve themselves and gradually reach the level of senior primary school and secondary school. It is necessary to run spare-time senior primary schools and spare-time secondary schools on a large scale, and strive to enable most young people to reach the level of graduation from senior primary school in four or five years or a little more, and to enable most young people to reach the level of secondary education in eight or nine years or a little more, and to have certain technical knowledge. For young people who already have secondary education or above, they should also be organized to continue self-study, and those who have the conditions can enter spare-time universities to study, and cultivate them into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and red to the core and expert in depth.
              (IV)
    To organize youth spare-time learning, we must adhere to the direction of being both red and expert. The content of spare-time learning should include three aspects: politics, culture, and technology, and the three should be combined. In terms of political learning, it should be combined with the domestic and international situation and central work to study current events and the Party's line and policies, and at the same time, according to the different levels of youth, gradually study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. In terms of technical learning, it is necessary to learn the current production and business technology needed, as well as the basic knowledge of production and business. In terms of cultural learning, it is necessary to learn Chinese and mathematics well, and to learn the necessary natural science knowledge. Cultural learning must be given great importance, because without a certain cultural and scientific foundation, it is impossible to learn political theory and professional technology well. Whether from the current or long-term needs, laying a good foundation of cultural and scientific knowledge is extremely important. For young people below the level of senior primary school, learning culture should be the main focus. For young people above the level of junior high school, in addition to continuing to learn basic cultural and scientific knowledge, the proportion of technical and business learning should be gradually increased according to needs and possibilities. The learning of politics, technology, and culture should all implement the policy of combining with production and serving production, but the proportion of these three types of learning should be different according to different units, different periods, and different objects.
              (V)
    To do a good job in youth spare-time learning, we must implement the working method of the mass line. It is necessary to strengthen ideological work, constantly encourage learning enthusiasm, commend and reward advanced individuals, and establish necessary learning discipline. In order to solve the difficulty of lacking teachers, we should follow the method of "using local materials and those who are capable as teachers," mobilize educated youth to serve as various spare-time teachers, and seize the work of cultivating and training them. In accordance with the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily, we should mobilize the masses to solve specific problems such as school buildings, school equipment, teaching aids, and funding. Textbooks are an important link to ensure the normal conduct of teaching; League committees above the county level must assist relevant departments to solve various textbooks above the spare-time senior primary school level in a timely manner, and supply popular reading materials suitable for young people.
    In order to make spare-time learning effective, learning time should also be guaranteed. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed: "At the present time, not only in cities, but also in rural areas, a system of eight hours of actual work and two hours of learning should be implemented on weekdays. When farming is busy or other work in rural areas is particularly busy, working hours can be appropriately extended." This fully reflects the Party's emphasis and concern for spare-time learning. The experience of many places has proved that as long as spare-time learning can be adapted to the characteristics of production, reasonably arranged, and paying attention to "learning more when less busy and learning less when very busy," it is possible to achieve no interference with labor, learning, and rest, with production as the center.
    The Red and Expert Schools and various spare-time schools that are all over the place now are the main battlefields for the broad masses of young people to conduct spare-time learning. League organizations at all levels should cooperate with the education departments to run these schools effectively. Running schools in workshops in factories and mines, and running schools in management areas and production teams in communes, are conducive to unifying the arrangement of production and learning time, and to strengthening the connection between learning and production, which should be promoted and supported.
                (VI)
    The unified leadership of the Party is the guarantee for doing a good job in spare-time learning. We must closely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to the mass line, and organize the spare-time learning work of young people, so that we can have the correct political direction, mobilize the forces of all parties, solve the difficulties in the work, arrange the time reasonably, and do a good job in spare-time learning. The Communist Youth League is the Party's natural assistant in carrying out the cultural revolution. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly instructed the League to manage this major event of spare-time learning well. League organizations at all levels should further recognize the importance of organizing youth spare-time learning, vigorously strengthen this work, and cooperate closely with relevant departments to work together. We should carry forward the experience in the anti-illiteracy movement, implement the participation of the whole League and management by specialists; conduct frequent propaganda to create momentum; cultivate key points to establish banners; and hold regular meetings to evaluate and reward, in order to set off and maintain a regular learning upsurge.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always been very concerned about the all-round growth of the younger generation. Comrade Mao Zedong's call for young people to "be good in health, good in study, and good in work" is extremely valuable to us. The Plenary Session calls on young people across the country to cherish their youth and never waste precious time. Let every member of the Communist Youth League and youth not only work outstandingly in production and work positions, but also study diligently, work hard, carry forward the spirit of perseverance, strive to climb the peaks of culture and science, and contribute the greatest strength to the great cause of socialist construction.

    共青团三届四中全会关于积极组织青年业余学习的决议
    一九五九年三月六日通过
                （一）
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，随着工农业生产的巨大高涨，技术革命和文化革命正在蓬勃发展。一九五八年，我国人民在生产大跃进的同时，在文化和技术学习方面也获得了巨大的成绩。但是，必须看到，我国现在的文化和技术水平是比较落后的，还不能适应高速度发展的经济建设的需要；而且，国家工业化、公社工业化以及农业机械化电气化事业越是向前发展，对于提高群众文化和技术水平的要求就越是迫切。努力提高广大人民的文化、技术和科学知识水平，是加速我国社会主义建设的必要条件，也是为了逐步消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，并在将来进一步过渡到共产主义准备必要的条件。
    在技术革命和文化革命中，我国青年是一支最积极最有生气的突击力量。青年正处在成长的时期，有着强烈的求知识和求进步的要求。党希望把青年一代造就成为具有共产主义觉悟和现代文化科学知识的新的一代。共青团三届四中全会要求各级团的组织，在带领青年大搞生产活动的同时，以极大的热情来组织和领导青年的学习，不断地提高我国青年的政治觉悟和文化、技术水平。这是共青团组织一项具有战略意义的光荣任务。
                （二）
    我国一亿三千万青年，分布在工矿、农村和学校等各个战线上。目前在各级全日制和半日制学校中学习的青年有一千多万人。今后这种学校还会有一个比较大的发展，它是为祖国社会主义建设培养各种人材的重要基地。但是，在我国目前条件下，百分之九十以上的青年是在工农业生产和其他工作的岗位上。因此，必须认真组织业余学习，以便提高广大青年的政治、文化、技术水平，使他们能够更好地为社会主义事业服务。共青团组织必须十分重视这方面的工作。
    几年来的经验，特别是一九五八年的经验证明，在生产岗位上的青年，利用业余时间进行学习，不仅是需要的，也是完全可能的。在一九五八年中，全国共扫除了青年文盲三千六百万人，参加红专学校和各种业余学校的青年则达五千万人以上，工农青年学哲学以及城市中开展的读书运动也取得了很大的成绩。不少工农青年在坚持了几年的业余学习之后，由于提高了政治、文化和技术水平，在生产中做出了更好的成绩。学习和生产，只要安排得好，是能够互相促进的。生产的大跃进，有力地激发了青年的求知欲望和学习积极性；而青年政治、文化和技术水平的提高，又有利于生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高。广大青年中的劳动高潮和学习高潮交织发展，已经成为我国社会主义建设高潮的重要组成部分。
    当然，在今后一个相当时期内，特别是苦战三年期间，生产劳动还是十分紧张的。在组织青年业余学习的时候，如果不考虑到这一情况，对业余学习要求过急，是不适当的。但是只抓生产，不管学习，认为业余学习无关重要，也是不对的。目前组织青年业余学习，条件是很好的，首先，各级党委对文化革命的各项事业都加强了领导；其次，农村在公社化以后，对劳动、休息和学习的时间更便于作统一的安排；最后，不仅广大青年的学习积极性空前高涨，而且组织业余教学的力量和经验都更加增多了。只要善于运用这些条件，我们就能协助党把青年的业余学习组织得更好。
              （三）
    中共中央和国务院在一九五八年九月发出的“关于教育工作的指示”中提出，要争取在十五年左右的时间内，基本上做到使全国青年和成年，凡是有条件的和自愿的，都可以受到高等教育。这个宏伟的目标，应当成为全团组织青年业余学习的奋斗纲领。
    扫除文盲是文化革命的第一步。一九五八年扫盲成绩很大，但还不巩固，已出现不少回生复盲现象，同时有相当数量的青年还处在文盲半文盲的状态。在这方面任何自满和松懈的情绪都是有害的。全团应当继续努力，严格按照扫盲标准，争取在两年或者更多一点的时间内，完成扫除青年文盲的任务，并且逐步推广汉语拼音和普通话。
    对于已经脱离文盲状态的青年，应当组织他们进一步提高，逐步达到高小和中学程度。要大办业余高小和业余中学，争取在四、五年或者更多一点的时间内，使大多数青年在文化上达到高小毕业的程度；在八、九年或者更多一点的时间内，使大多数青年达到中等的文化程度，并且具有一定的技术知识。对于已经具有中等教育以上程度的青年，也应当组织他们继续自学，有条件的可以进入业余大学学习，把他们培养成为又红又专、红透专深的工人阶级知识分子。
              （四）
    组织青年的业余学习，必须坚持又红又专的方向。业余学习的内容，应当包括政治、文化、技术三个方面，并把三者结合起来进行。在政治学习方面，应当结合国内外形势和中心工作，学习时事和党的路线政策，同时还应根据青年不同的水平，逐步地学习马克思列宁主义的基础知识和毛泽东同志的著作。在技术学习方面，既要学习当前需要的生产、业务技术，也要学习生产和业务的基础知识。在文化学习方面，要学好语文和数学，并且学习必要的自然科学知识。对于文化学习必须十分重视，因为，没有一定的文化科学基础知识，要想学好政治理论和专业技术，是不可能的。无论从当前和长远的需要来看，打好文化科学知识的基础，都是极为重要的。对于高小以下程度的青年，应当以学习文化为主。对于初中以上程度的青年，除继续学习文化科学基础知识外，还应根据需要和可能，逐步增加技术和业务学习的比重。政治、技术、文化的学习，都应贯彻结合生产、为生产服务的方针，但这三种学习的比重，应该按不同单位、不同时期、不同对象而有所区别。
              （五）
    搞好青年的业余学习，必须贯彻群众路线的工作方法。要加强思想工作，不断鼓舞学习情绪，表扬奖励先进，并建立必要的学习纪律。为了解决缺少教师的困难，应该按照“就地取材，能者为师”的办法，发动有文化的青年去担任各种业余教师，并抓紧对他们的培养训练工作。要按照勤俭办学的原则，发动群众自己动手，解决校舍、校具、教具、经费等具体问题。教材是保证教学正常进行的重要环节；县以上团委必须协助有关部门及时解决业余高小以上的各种教材，并且供应适合青年需要的通俗读物。
    为了使业余学习获得成效，还应当保证学习时间。党的八届六中全会决议提出：“在目前时期，不但在城市中，而且在农村中，应当实行平时实际工作八小时，学习二小时的制度。农忙或者农村其他工作特别忙的时候，工作时间可以适当延长一些。”这充分体现了党对业余学习的重视和关怀。不少地方的经验证明，只要能够使业余学习适应生产的特点，加以合理安排，注意“小忙多学，大忙少学”，是可以做到以生产为中心的劳动、学习、休息三不误的。
    现在遍布各地的红专学校和各种业余学校，是广大青年进行业余学习的主要阵地。各级团组织应当配合教育部门把这些学校切实办好。厂矿中的车间办学、公社的管理区、生产队办学，便于统一安排生产和学习的时间，便于加强学习和生产的联系，应当加以提倡和支持。
                （六）
    党的统一领导是搞好业余学习的保证。必须紧紧地依靠党的领导，坚持群众路线，组织青年的业余学习工作，才能有正确的政治方向，才能调动各方面的力量，解决工作中的困难，合理地安排时间，把业余学习搞好。共青团是党进行文化革命的天然助手，党中央和毛泽东同志曾经多次指示，要团把业余学习这件大事管好。各级团组织应当进一步认识组织青年业余学习的重要性、大力加强这一工作，并且和有关部门密切协作，一致努力。我们应当发扬扫盲运动中的经验，实行全团动手，专人管理；经常宣传，造成声势；培养重点，树立旗帜；定期开会，评比奖励；以掀起和保持经常的学习热潮。
    党中央和毛泽东同志对青年一代的全面成长从来就是十分关心的。毛泽东同志号召青年作到“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，对于我们是极为宝贵的。全会号召，全国青年必须十分珍惜自己的青春时期，决不浪费宝贵的光阴。让我们每一个共青团员和青年，不但在生产和工作岗位上出色地劳动，而且能够勤奋学习，刻苦钻研，发扬坚韧不拔的精神，努力攀登文化、科学的高峰，为伟大的社会主义建设事业贡献出最大的力量。
