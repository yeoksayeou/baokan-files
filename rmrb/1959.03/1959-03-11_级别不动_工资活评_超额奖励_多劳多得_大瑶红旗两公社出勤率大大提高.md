According to a report from the New Hunan Daily: In the Da Yao Commune in Liuyang, Hunan, and the Dongfeng Commune in Huayuan, in implementing a distribution system that combines wages and supply, in addition to constantly paying attention to socialist and communist ideological education for cadres and the masses to establish a correct work ethic, they have also experimented with several different methods of calculating compensation for the wage portion distributed to commune members. This involves combining labor quotas, basic workdays, basic wages, and bonuses, generally keeping grades unchanged but flexibly assessing wages. Although these methods are still in the exploratory stage, the results of the trials show that they have played a certain role in encouraging the production enthusiasm of the masses.

The broad masses of cadres and commune members in these two communes actively support the implementation of the new distribution system that combines wages and supply. However, the commune party committee, from the practice of implementing this new distribution system, felt that if the wage portion was only paid according to the assessed grade without quotas or attendance, there would be no unified standard for the quantity and quality of commune members' labor, and there would be no necessary basis for inspecting production and distributing bonuses. Therefore, during the rectification of the commune, by summarizing the distribution work of the previous period, several different methods of calculating compensation were trialed.

The Da Yao Commune in Liuyang trialed two methods: One was the Shanhu Brigade's method of stipulating basic workdays according to labor power, calculating labor points according to work quotas, and rewarding or penalizing monthly. This brigade first stipulated the basic workdays for each commune member each month according to their wage grade and actual situation. After commune members participated in production each day, the team leader or work recorder assessed work points at the work site, filled out attendance sheets daily, and posted them on the dining hall wall. Settlement was carried out at the end of the month. Those who exceeded the quota of work points were given wage bonuses, and those who did not meet the quota had their wages deducted. Wages were distributed to the brigade by the commune monthly. The total amount of basic wages received by the brigade each month was generally fixed, so as not to disrupt the commune's wage plan; the bonus portion was distributed monthly by the commune according to the production performance of each brigade. The brigade divided the total number of work points of the entire team by the total amount of wages to determine the amount of wages that each work point should receive. The second method was the Jingang Brigade's method, which stipulated the basic workdays for each person each month according to the specific situation of each laborer. After commune members participated in production each day, the team recorded different symbols (such as A, B, C, D, etc.) according to each person's work attitude and completion of the quota, and posted them in the dining hall daily. During the final monthly evaluation, those with more "A"s and who exceeded the basic workdays had their wages increased, and those with more "D"s and who failed to complete the workdays without reason had their wages deducted. The commune party committee held a meeting of commune and brigade cadres to conduct a preliminary summary and study of these two methods. Most believed that the first method (the Shanhu Brigade's method) was better, and therefore began to promote it throughout the commune from January.

The Dongfeng Commune in Huayuan County trialed three methods: The first was the "fixed points by grade, assess both ends" method trialed by the Longdong Brigade. That is, the total wages and labor grades of the brigade remained unchanged each month, and the base points for each grade of labor were set at ten points per person per day. The wages to be received were also divided into ten points, and the value of one point per person per day for each grade of labor was calculated as the basis for awarding or deducting wages. Then, attendance was taken based on the actual production time, work attitude, and task completion of each grade of labor. Commune members conducted an evaluation once every one or two days or three to five days, only evaluating both ends, that is, evaluating those who performed exceptionally well and those who performed exceptionally poorly. Those who performed well were rewarded with an additional two points or more, in addition to the ten points they should have received, depending on the circumstances; those who performed poorly were deducted points; those who performed generally were neither rewarded nor deducted. Settlement was conducted once a month before wages were issued. The cash portion of the wages deducted for penalizing work points was the cash portion of the wages awarded for rewarding work points. The commune believed that the advantage of this method was that it was closely integrated with the basis of grading, taking into account the quality of labor skills and the level of ideological awareness. At the same time, because only both ends were focused on, there were not many people to evaluate, the method was simple, and the required evaluation time was not long. The disadvantage was that because the penalized portion was the rewarded portion, if there were few work points penalized and many work points rewarded in the current month, the value of the rewarding work points would be very low. Conversely, if there were many work points penalized and few work points rewarded in the current month, the value of the rewarding work points would be very high. In this way, there would be imbalances and irrationalities between months. The second method was the Liangshuijing Brigade's method, which, on the basis of the first method's calculation of point values, specifically evaluated each person in each evaluation, regardless of the quality of labor performance, and formulated quotas for each type of labor. Those assigned to individuals were given points based on their completion of the quota; those assigned to work groups were scored by the group itself based on the group's quota. Wages were rewarded or deducted at the end of the month. The commune believed that the advantage of this method was that it was more detailed than the first method, but because work points were recorded to individuals according to quotas, the procedures were troublesome. The third method was the Wangcheng Brigade's "evaluate work and record points, issue wages monthly" method. That is, after the brigade received the total wages for the entire team from the commune each month, it formulated different quotas for various types of farm work and assigned them to individuals or work groups for long or short periods of time depending on the circumstances; then, it divided the total number of work points earned by all commune members in the entire team by the total wages of the entire team each month to determine the work point value, and distributed wages to commune members according to the number of points earned by each person; those who performed well in long-term fixed farm work were given appropriate rewards from the bonus wage portion. The commune believed that this method could also play a positive role in attendance rates and work efficiency; however, this method was basically the same as the work evaluation and point recording method adopted by the original advanced cooperative, and at the same time, it was detached from the basis of grading, which would be unreasonable in some places; moreover, evaluating work every night, calculating points every day, and engaging in small quotas for everything would bring many troubles to management. Now, these three methods are still being trialed to weigh the pros and cons and learn from each other's strengths to create experience.

Although the methods trialed by the two communes each have their own advantages and disadvantages, they all have a significant effect on further mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the masses.

According to a report from the Shaanxi Daily: In the process of rectifying the commune, the Hongqi People's Commune in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, accepted the opinions of commune members and implemented the method of "fixed grades, flexible wages," and also implemented responsibility to the field and everyone is responsible, which greatly improved work efficiency and quality. The implementation of this method has largely solved the problem of labor shortage.

Since the Hongqi Commune implemented the wage system plus food supply system last October, the production enthusiasm of the commune members has been very high. However, due to the lack of experience in labor management, the production potential of commune members is still very large.

The commune party committee studied this situation and, in conjunction with the rectification of the commune, mobilized commune members to speak out and debate to tap labor potential. After more than ten days of study and debate, the commune party committee accepted the opinions of commune members and decided to implement the method of "fixed grades, flexible wages." The so-called "fixed grades, flexible wages" means that the wage grade of the commune members (seven grades) is generally unchanged, and the commune members are assigned to work according to the level of the grade, the lightness, heaviness, difficulty and ease of the work; work points are stipulated separately in the morning, noon, and afternoon; regardless of the level of the grade, working one day is ten points, that is, one day of attendance; if you work two and a half days, you will be given a day of attendance. Male laborers are required to attend twenty-eight days a month, and female laborers are required to attend twenty-five days a month. Those who are fully attending will be paid according to their grade, those who are absent will have their wages deducted according to the number of days of absence, those who are over attending will have their wages increased according to the number of days of over attendance, and those who are injured at work will be recorded as days of attendance. While promoting this method, the commune also established a evaluation system of "small evaluation every ten days, big evaluation every month." In order to save evaluation time, only both ends are evaluated during the "small evaluation." Those who are evaluated as upper reaches three times will be upgraded. The evaluation conditions are: work attitude, work quality, and number of days of attendance. After the commune implemented "fixed grades, flexible wages" and periodic evaluations, the number of commune members attending work increased from 75% to 95%.

    级别不动  工资活评  超额奖励  多劳多得
    大瑶红旗两公社出勤率大大提高
    据新湖南报消息　湖南浏阳大瑶公社和花垣东风公社在实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度中，除经常注意对干部和群众进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，使之树立正确的劳动态度外，对分配给社员的工资部分，又试行了几种不同的计酬办法，这就是将劳动定额、基本劳动日和基本工资加奖励结合起来，一般是级别不动，工资活评。这些办法虽然还是处于摸索阶段，但从试行的效果来看，都起了一定作用，鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。
    这两个公社的广大干部和社员对实行工资制和供给制相结合的新的分配制度，是积极拥护的。但是，公社党委从实行这种新的分配制度的实践中，感到工资部分如果只按评定的级别付给，没有定额和考勤，社员劳动的数量和质量就没有一个统一的标准，对于检查生产，分发奖励工资等，就没有必要的依据。于是在整顿公社工作中，通过总结前一段分配工作的情况，试行了几种不同的计酬办法。
    浏阳大瑶公社试行了两种作法：一种是山虎大队按劳动力规定基本劳动日，按工作定额计算劳动工分，按月进行奖罚的办法。这个大队首先根据每个社员工资等级和实际情况按月规定各人的基本劳动日，社员每天参加生产以后，由小队长或记工员在工地评定工分，逐日填写考勤表，在食堂墙壁上公布，月终进行结算，超过定额工分的给予工资奖励，不足定额的照扣工资，工资由公社每月分发给大队。大队每月领取的基本工资总额一般是固定的，以免打乱公社的工资计划；奖励工资部分则由公社按月根据各大队生产好坏情况分发。大队每月将全队的工分总数除工资总数，得出每个工分应得的工资数。第二种是金刚大队的办法，即按每个劳动力的具体情况规定每人每月的基本工作日，社员每天参加生产后，小队根据每人的劳动态度和完成定额情况，用不同符号（如甲、乙、丙、丁等）记录，逐日在食堂公布，月终总评议时，“甲”字多而又超过基本工作日的提高工资，“丁”字多而又无故不完成工作日的扣工资。公社党委曾召开社、队干部会议对这两种办法进行了初步的总结和研究，大多数认为第一种办法（山虎大队的办法）较好，因而从元月份已开始在全社推行。
    花垣县东风公社试行了三种办法：第一种是龙洞大队试行的“按级定分，两头评分”的办法。即大队向公社每月领的总工资和劳动力的工资等级都不动，将各级劳力的底分每天每人定为十分，应得的工资数，也分为十分，分别求出各级劳动力每人每天一分的分值，作为奖扣工资的根据。然后以各级劳力的实际生产时间、劳动态度、任务完成情况等来考勤，一、两天或三、五天由社员评议一次，只评两头，即评表现突出好的和突出不好的。对表现好的按情况除应得十分外，另外再奖励二分，或再多一些；对表现不好的则予以扣分；对表现一般的不奖不扣。每月在发工资前结算一次，惩扣工分的工资现金部分，就是奖励工分的工资现金部分。公社认为，这种办法的优点是，和评级的基础结合很紧密，照顾了劳力技术好坏和思想觉悟的高低，同时由于只抓两头，评的人不多，方法简单，所需评议时间不长；缺点是因为惩扣部分即为奖励部分，如果本月惩扣工分少、受奖工分多，则奖励工分值就很少，反之如果本月惩扣工分多、受奖工分少，奖励工分值就很高，这样，就会出现月与月之间的不平衡和不合理现象。第二种是凉水井大队的办法，即在第一种办法计算分值的基础上，不论劳动表现好坏，每次评议都具体到每一个人，并制订出每种劳动的定额。安排到个人的，按定额完成情况计分；安排到作业组的，则由组内按全组定额自己评分，月终奖励或扣发工资。公社认为，这种办法的好处是比第一种办法更细一些，但是由于按定额评记工分到人，手续麻烦。第三种是望城大队的“评工记分，按月发工资”的办法，即大队按月向公社领取全队工资后，将各种农活制订出不同的定额，根据情况长期或短期安排到人或作业组；然后按月根据全队社员所做的工分总数除全队工资总数，得出工分值，照各人得分多少分发给社员；对长年固定的农活，表现得好的则另由奖励工资部分中适当奖给。这种办法，公社认为也能在出勤率和工效上起到积极的作用；但是这种办法和原高级社所采用的评工记分办法基本相同，同时脱离了评级的基础，在一些地方就会不够合理；而且夜夜评工、天天计分、事事搞小定额，给管理上也带来不少麻烦。现在这三种办法都仍在继续试行，以权衡利弊，并互相取长补短，创造经验。
    两个公社试行的这些办法虽然还各有利弊，但对进一步调动群众生产积极性上都有显著的作用。
    据陕西日报消息　陕西省西乡县红旗人民公社在整社过程中，接受社员意见，实行了“死级别、活工资”的办法，并且还实行了责任到田、人人负责，这样大大提高了工作效率和作活质量。由于这种办法的实行，在很大程度上解决了劳动力不足的问题。
    红旗公社自去年10月实行工资制加伙食供给制以后，社员生产积极性很高。但由于劳动管理工作缺乏经验，社员生产潜力还很大。
    公社党委研究了这一情况，结合整社，发动社员鸣放辩论，挖掘劳动潜力。通过十多天的学习和辩论，公社党委接受社员的意见，决定实行“死级别、活工资”的办法。所谓“死级别、活工资”就是：社员的工资级别（七个级别）一般不动，根据级别高低，活路轻重难易，分配给社员去作；按早晨、中午、下午分别规定工分；不分级别高低，作一天工为十分，也就是一个出勤日；如果作两个半天就给记一个出勤日。男劳力规定每月出勤二十八天，女劳力规定每月出勤二十五天。满勤的按级别发给工资，缺勤的按缺勤日扣发工资，超勤的按超勤日加发工资，因工负伤照记出勤日。公社在推行这个办法的同时，还建立了“十天一小评、一月一大评”的评比制度。为了节省评比时间，进行“小评比”时，只评两头。三次评为上游，给予升级。评比条件是：劳动态度作活质量、出勤天数。公社实行“死级别、活工资”和按期评比之后，社员出勤人数由75％增加到了95％。
