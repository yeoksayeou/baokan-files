A Casual Discussion of the Cheng School
    Ma Shaobo

    I remember last year today, when Guo Lao commemorated Comrade Yanqiu, he said: "Comrade Cheng Yanqiu's life was one of exerting great effort and striving for progress!"

    This one sentence is a definitive and accurate assessment. In Comrade Yanqiu's life, he never wasted his time. He not only maintained noble sentiments and an inviolable national integrity in politics, finally embarking on the revolutionary road of communism under the Party's cultivation; but also, as an outstanding artist, diligently worked throughout his life, creatively developing the art of Peking Opera Dan roles, forming a unique and beautiful artistic style, and making significant contributions to the people's art cause.

    Comrade Yanqiu was known for his performance of tragedies. Indeed, most of his repertoire was tragic. This is inseparable from the dark society he lived in before liberation and his deeply resentful attitude towards the dark phenomena of society. In the old society, cruelly oppressed by the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, an upright artist, hearing, seeing, and even personally experiencing all kinds of suffering, always wanted to express his protests and wishes to the world directly or indirectly through artistic images. Therefore, his repertoire was inevitably filled with indignation towards the dark society and sympathy for the people. This spirit of realism is the most fundamental quality of Cheng School tragedies. It is by no means a morbid lament, but a clear expression of the artist's political tendencies. Comrade Yanqiu's character of hating evil like an enemy and being坚强不屈 determined and unyielding determined his healthy tone in art. The tragedies he performed had a power to shake people's hearts, and a clear song would often bring tears to people's eyes. In those years, Mr. Ma Xulun watched his performance and wrote such moving verses:

      Why bother with the Wuding River of that year,
      Just listen to a song before your eyes.
      How many people in the audience cover their faces,
      Look, my green robe has the most tears!

    Will tears of emotion lead to pessimism and despair? No, it won't be like that. On the contrary, it is precisely because it reveals social contradictions through artistic images, distinguishes between good and evil, touches people's hearts, and meaningfully cultivates the moral qualities of the people, guiding and encouraging people to fight against evil things, and giving people strong perseverance and beautiful wishes, which constitutes the rich popularity and distinct fighting style of Cheng School art. Of course, Comrade Yanqiu's comedies are also good, such as "The Flower Boat Romance," "A Daughter's Heart," "The Story of Hong拂," and "Tricking Wen娟." It may be because he felt so much injustice and was so deeply melancholy in the old society that his comedies were particularly few in his repertoire.

    The Cheng School's singing style is not only beautiful and pleasing to the ear, but also has the power to move people. People love the Cheng style, and it has swept the north and south for many years, truly reaching an enchanting degree.

    The characteristic of the Cheng style is that it is soft yet contains strength. Due to the positive ideological tendencies in the scripts and the strong character given to the protagonists, Comrade Yanqiu created artistic images to express emotions, strictly proceeding from the authenticity of the characters' thoughts and personalities, accurately grasping the characteristics of historical conditions and the characters' living environment, and working hard to study them. Therefore, his singing sounds melancholic and tactful, with a winding and low voice, containing a kind of vigorous, fresh, and sharp power, deeply touching people's hearts. This is the most valuable feature of the Cheng style. Unfortunately, Comrade Yanqiu began to gain weight in middle age, and his demeanor in his later years was not as good as in his early years. Therefore, among some young audiences, an illusion has almost formed that Cheng School art is only the Cheng style, which is a big mistake. In fact, Comrade Yanqiu's art not only has outstanding achievements in singing, but also in creating character images, such as expressions, movements, and even water sleeve skills, has reached a precise, perfect, and consummate state.

    Comrade Yanqiu went through a very difficult and tortuous road in his long-term creative practice. Comrade Yanqiu was poor in his childhood and started learning opera very early. He initially learned Hua旦 (female comic role) and Daoma旦 (female warrior role) from Rong Diexian; later, due to circumstances, he switched to Qing衣 (virtuous female role). His first teacher in Qing衣 was the famous Dan Chen Xiaoyun. From then on, he laid a solid foundation, but after "倒仓" (voice change) in his teens, his voice did not fully change, but it did not completely fail either, resulting in a kind of "立音" (standing voice), the so-called "brain after voice," which insiders call "ghost voice." This kind of voice can be high or low, can be stretched or bent, but it does not conform to the specifications of the Qing衣 singing style of that year. The older generation believed that this kind of voice had no future in singing Qing衣. Later, he became a student of Wang Yaoqing, and even Mr. Wang initially regretted it, thinking that "ghost voices have no future"; but Wang Yaoqing was, after all, an outstanding Peking Opera educator. He cherished Comrade Yanqiu very much, gave him great inspiration, and believed that he should open up a new path according to his own voice conditions. If this kind of voice imitated others and followed the trend, it would "have no future," but if he "闯" (pioneered), he would "have a future." Comrade Yanqiu was encouraged and inspired by this, worked even harder, and with the enthusiastic help of Mr. Yaoqing, he studied and created, gradually creating his own singing method, which was the beginning of the later popular, melancholic, and tactful Cheng style.

    Comrade Yanqiu was a brave general who correctly inherited traditions and dared to create and innovate. He strived for progress and never stuck to conventions, respecting traditions and laying a good foundation, and also making great efforts to develop traditions with his own creative spirit. Especially when his own talent conditions were not very good, he was even more motivated and invigorated. He believed that as a Peking Opera actor, his voice was important, but not the only thing. He must develop comprehensively in singing, performance, politics, and culture. With a good voice, he must also be good at using it. Paying attention to singing methods must be based on conditions to create and innovate. The singing style must be beautiful and pleasing to the ear; but the purpose of being pleasing to the ear is not for anything else, but to profoundly express the character's personality and emotions, and to infect the audience. Therefore, the pronunciation must be accurate and clear, the rhythm must be clear, the melody must be rich, and the emotions must be full. There must never be singing without words or words without singing. Singing and performance must form an organic whole. Otherwise, a good voice would be wasted. Comrade Yanqiu's views are correct. Not only Comrade Yanqiu, but also Mr. Wang Yaoqing, Yan Jupeng, Zhou Xinfang, Xun Huisheng... their voice conditions were not very good, but didn't they all adopt such a scientific attitude to form their own style and create their own artistic schools and styles?

    Excellent art will inevitably be loved and respected by the people, and under the guidance of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" policy, it will inevitably have unlimited prospects. How to inherit and promote Cheng School art in the future lies in the inheritors first clarifying the path and law of Comrade Yanqiu's artistic development, correcting their attitude towards learning and creation, and truly mastering his creative methods and artistic techniques; and further carrying it forward according to their own conditions. Comrade Yanqiu was most opposed to sticking to conventions and stagnating before his death. Facts have proved that "the student surpasses the teacher" must be seriously learned, inherited, and correctly and boldly created and developed. We look back on the past: Tan Xinpei's relationship with Cheng Changgeng, Yang Xiaolou's relationship with Yu Jusheng, Mei, Cheng, Shang, and Xun's relationship with Mei Qiaoling, Yu Ziyun, Shi Xiaofu, Wang Yaoqing, and even the great commonalities in artistic style between Mei, Cheng, Shang, and Xun, but also the great differences, this commonality and difference is the concrete embodiment of the dialectical relationship between inheritance and development, and it can also fully explain the essence of the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom."

    At this New Year, I have recorded this with emotion after returning from sweeping Comrade Yanqiu's tomb. We firmly believe that Cheng School art and other excellent artistic schools of various types will "flowers follow the red meaning to bloom, leaves follow the green feeling to be new," and will inevitably bear fruit again, bloom again, and bear fruit again. Every year we watch the flourishing blossoms, and the art of our predecessors will be immortal forever!

    漫谈程派
    马少波
    记得去年今日，郭老在公祭砚秋同志的时候，曾这样说过：“程砚秋同志的一生，是鼓足干劲力争上游的一生！”
    一语论定，确切极了。在砚秋同志的一生中，真不曾虚度年华，他不仅在政治上一直保持了高洁的情操和凛然不可侵犯的民族气节，终于在党的培养下，走上了共产主义的革命的道路；而且作为一个卓越的艺术家，勤恳终生，创造性地发展了京剧旦角艺术，形成了独特的优美的艺术风格，为人民的艺术事业作出了重大的贡献。
    砚秋同志是以表演悲剧著称的。他的演出剧目，的确悲剧居多。这与他在解放前所处的黑暗社会和他对于社会黑暗现象所采取的深恶痛绝的生活态度是分不开的。在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山残酷压迫的旧社会中，一个正直的艺术家，听到看到的以至亲身遭遇的种种痛苦因而产生的抗议和愿望，总是想通过艺术形象把它直接或曲折的倾诉于世的，于是，在他演出的剧目中，不能不充满着对黑暗社会的愤懑和对人民的同情，这种现实主义的精神是程派悲剧中最根本的素质，他绝不是无病呻吟，而是鲜明地表现出艺术家的政治倾向。砚秋同志嫉恶如仇、坚强不屈的品格，决定了他的艺术中健康的基调，他所演的悲剧，具有震撼人心的力量，清歌一曲，往往使人热泪沾襟。当年马叙伦先生看了他的演出，就曾写下这样动人的诗句：
      何必当年无定河，
      且听一曲眼前歌。
      坐中掩面人多少，
      检我青袍泪独多！
    热泪沾襟，会使人悲观绝望么？不，不会是那样，恰恰相反，正是因为它通过艺术形象揭示了社会的矛盾，判明善恶，扣人心弦，意味深长地培养人民的道德品质，引导和鼓舞人们对邪恶事物进行斗争，给人以坚强的毅力和美好的愿望，这就构成了程派艺术丰富的人民性和鲜明的战斗的风格。当然，砚秋同志的喜剧也是好的，如“花舫缘”、“女儿心”、“红拂传”、“赚文娟”等。可能是由于他在旧社会中不平之甚，忧郁之深，在他的剧目中，喜剧显得特别少。
    程派唱腔不但优美动听，而且富有感人的力量。人们喜爱程腔，多少年来风靡南北，真是到了迷人的程度。
    程腔的特点，是柔中含刚，由于剧本中积极的思想倾向和赋予剧中主人公的坚强性格，砚秋同志创造艺术形象表达感情，十分严格地从人物的思想性格的真实性出发，确切掌握历史条件和人物生活环境的特点，刻苦钻研，因而他的唱腔，听来幽咽婉转，曲折低回声中，蕴涵一种刚劲清新锋芒逼人的力量，深深地打动人心，这是程腔最可贵的特色。可惜砚秋同志在中年即开始发胖，晚年丰采更不似早年，因而在一些青年观众中几乎形成一种错觉，以为程派艺术，只是程腔而已，这是大误。其实砚秋同志的艺术，不但在唱腔方面有优异的成就，而且在创造人物形象方面，像表情、动作身段以至水袖工夫都达到了精确完美炉火纯青的境界。
    砚秋同志在长期的创作实践中，是经过了十分艰难曲折的道路的。砚秋同志幼年贫苦，学戏很早，最初跟荣蝶仙学过花旦、刀马旦；后来因条件关系改学青衣，青衣开蒙师是名旦陈孝云。从此打下了稳固的基础，但是十几岁“倒仓”之后，嗓音未能全变，但也没有全倒，出现了一种“立音”，即所谓“脑后音”，内行叫作“鬼音”的。这种音能高能低、能伸能屈，但是不合乎当年青衣唱工的规格。老一辈认为这种嗓音唱青衣是没有前途的。后来，他拜王瑶卿为师，连王先生最初也为之惋惜，认为“鬼音没饭了”；可是王瑶卿毕竟是杰出的京戏教育家，他很爱惜砚秋同志，给予他很大的启发，认为应该根据自己的嗓音条件别开蹊径，这种嗓音如果模仿别人随俗当令就“没饭”，要“闯”就“有饭”。砚秋同志受到这种激励和鼓舞，更加发奋用功，在瑶卿先生的热心帮助之下，钻研创造，逐渐独创了自己的唱法，这就是以后脍炙人口幽咽婉转的程腔的开始。
    砚秋同志是正确继承传统勇于创造革新的一员猛将。他力争上游，决不墨守成规，既尊重传统，打好根基，又以极大努力在传统基础上发挥独创精神，发展传统，特别是当自己的天赋条件不太好的时候，更加激励奋发，他认为作为京戏演员，嗓子是重要的，但不是唯一的，必须从歌唱、表演、政治、文化全面发展，有了嗓子，还须善于运用。讲究唱法，必须根据条件创造革新，唱腔要作到美妙动听；但动听的目的不是为了别的，而是为了深刻表现人物的性格感情，感染观众，因而吐字要准确清晰，节奏鲜明，旋律丰富，感情充实，决不可有腔无字或者有字无腔。歌唱和表演必须形成有机的整体。不然的话，好嗓子也是枉费。砚秋同志的见解是正确的，岂止砚秋同志，像王瑶卿、言菊朋、周信芳、荀慧生……诸先生嗓音条件并不很好，不都是采取这样科学的态度才形成一家，独创了自己的艺术流派和风格的吗？
    优秀的艺术必然受到人民的喜爱和尊重，在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针指导下，必然是前途无限的。今后如何继承和发扬程派艺术，在于继承者首先明确砚秋同志艺术发展的道路和规律，端正学习和创造的态度，切实掌握他的创造方法和艺术技巧；根据自己的条件进一步发扬光大。砚秋同志生前是最反对墨守成规，停滞不前的。事实证明，“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”是必须认真地学习、继承，而又必须正确的大胆的加以创造和发展。我们回顾往事：谭鑫培之对程长庚，杨小楼之对俞菊笙，梅、程、尚、荀之对梅巧玲、余紫云、时小福、王瑶卿，甚至梅、程、尚、荀之间，在艺术风格上有很大的共同性，但又有极大的差异性，这种共同性和差异性，就是继承和发展的辩证关系的具体体现，也完全可以说明“百花齐放”的精神实质。
    际此新春，为砚秋同志扫墓归来，有感录此。我们坚信程派艺术和其他各种各行优秀的艺术流派，都会“花随红意发，叶就绿情新”，而且必然是再结果，再开花，再结果的。年年岁岁看繁英，前辈的艺术将永远不朽！
