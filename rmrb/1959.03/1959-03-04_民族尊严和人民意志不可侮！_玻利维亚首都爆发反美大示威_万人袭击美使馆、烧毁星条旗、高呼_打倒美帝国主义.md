Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, La Paz dispatch: A massive anti-American demonstration erupted in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, on March 2nd. Ten thousand angry people attacked the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia and the U.S. Information Service with stones, and burned the American flag.

It is reported that the demonstration was triggered by an insulting article about Bolivia published in "Time" magazine. The Bolivian government condemned the article, saying that it "damaged Bolivia's national dignity and is intolerable to the Bolivian people." The article quoted an unnamed American diplomat as saying that in order to "rescue" Bolivia from its economic crisis, the United States had futilely "spent" $129 million. The diplomat also insulted the country by saying that Bolivia's economic difficulties could only be solved by "dividing Bolivia and merging it with its neighbors."

The news stated that the demonstrators, shouting slogans of "Down with U.S. Imperialism," burned two cars belonging to the U.S. Embassy and all copies of "Time" magazine sold at local newsstands. Bolivian newspapers have published articles severely criticizing "Time" magazine for insulting the Bolivian people. The government newspaper "La Nación" reported the above events on its front page with the headline "Imperialist Shameless Claws Insult Bolivia." Other newspapers published editorials and articles expressing protest. Various Bolivian political organizations, universities, and student organizations have condemned the magazine.

It is reported that Bolivian Ambassador to the United States, Manuel Barrau, delivered a note to U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herter on the evening of the 2nd, protesting to the United States about the aforementioned insulting article in "Time" magazine.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Washington dispatch: The Bolivian government formally protested to the U.S. government on the 2nd regarding "Time" magazine's insult to Bolivia. The protest note was delivered to U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herter by Bolivian Ambassador to the U.S., Manuel Barrau.

It is reported that Barrau told reporters after meeting with Herter that the article published by "Time" magazine was "extremely harmful" to Bolivia, and Bolivia is awaiting a formal reply from the United States.

It is also reported that the ruling party of Bolivia, the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, called on Latin American countries to jointly strengthen the maintenance of international justice in Latin America from attacks by this North American financial clique's publication.

Bolivian agriculture is very backward, and it needs to import 50%-70% of its grain every year. In the arable land of Bolivia, large landowners and foreign monopoly capitalists control 70%-80%. On August 2, 1953, under the pressure of the people, the Bolivian government promulgated the Land Reform Law. In order to make Bolivia a permanent market for surplus agricultural products in the United States, U.S. monopoly capital colluded with the domestic landlord groups of Bolivia to force the Bolivian government not to implement the decree on land reform.

In order to step up plunder and exploitation, U.S. monopoly capital forced the Bolivian government to accept the so-called Eder Plan to stabilize the Bolivian economy in December 1956. The implementation of this plan, drafted by American advisors, has plunged Bolivia into serious economic difficulties. The Bolivian currency has depreciated sharply, and the exchange rate between the Boliviano (Bolivian currency) and the U.S. dollar has plummeted from one hundred and eighty to one in 1952 to eleven thousand to one in 1958. The "Eder Plan" has also caused Bolivia's production to shrink and prices to rise sharply.

The lives of the Bolivian people have fallen into dire straits under the increasingly tight control of U.S. monopoly capital. According to "Time" magazine, Bolivia has the highest cost of living in the world, and from 1945 to the third quarter of 1957, the cost of living increased by two thousand and two hundred times. The wages of Bolivian workers are only 4% of the wages of American miners. As for the working conditions, they are even more terrible. A "New York Times" news item stated, "All food is imported from abroad... 60% of the workers have lung diseases... 50% of the babies do not live to be one year old, and those who survive have an average life expectancy of only thirty-five years... There are no hospitals, and any illness or serious injury means death."

U.S. monopoly capital has brought unparalleled pain and disaster to the Bolivian people, so the Bolivian people have continuously launched struggles against U.S. monopoly capital. On March 11, 1958, the Bolivian Miners' Federation launched a nationwide strike; on April 22 of the same year, students in La Paz held an anti-American demonstration to protest against the U.S. looting of Bolivia's oil resources; then on May 5, when Nixon arrived in La Paz, the Bolivian people held another large-scale anti-American demonstration. A pamphlet distributed by the Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Front said: "Our country is the cradle of patriotism and the graveyard of tyrants and imperialism." The Bolivian people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is on the rise. The anti-American demonstration that broke out in La Paz on March 2 marks a new upsurge in the Bolivian people's anti-American struggle. (United States)

    民族尊严和人民意志不可侮！
    玻利维亚首都爆发反美大示威
    万人袭击美使馆、烧毁星条旗、高呼“打倒美帝国主义”
    新华社3日讯  拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚首都拉巴斯2日爆发了巨大的反美示威游行。一万名愤怒的群众用石子袭击了美国驻玻利维亚大使馆和美国新闻处，并且烧掉了美国的国旗。
    据报道，这次示威游行是因为美国“时代”周刊发表了一篇侮辱玻利维亚的文章引起的。玻利维亚政府谴责说，这篇文章“损害了玻利维亚的民族尊严，是玻利维亚人民所不能容忍的”。这篇文章援引未署名的一位美国外交家的谈话说，为了把玻利维亚从经济危机中“解救”出来，美国徒然
  “耗费”了一亿二千九百万美元。这位外交家还侮辱说，只有把“玻利维亚瓜分并且与它的邻国合并，才能解决玻利维亚的经济困难。”
    消息说，高呼着“打倒美帝国主义”的口号的示威群众烧毁了美国大使馆的两辆汽车，并且还烧掉了所有当地报摊上出卖的“时代”周刊。玻利维亚报纸纷纷发表文章，严厉抨击美国“时代”周刊对玻利维亚人民的侮辱。政府报纸“民族报”在第一版上以“帝国主义无耻的脚爪侮辱玻利维亚”的大字标题报道了上述事件。其他报纸发表了社论和文章表示抗议。玻利维亚的一些政治组织、大学和学生组织都谴责这家杂志。
    据报道，玻利维亚驻美国大使曼努埃尔·巴劳在2日晚上交给美国代理国务卿赫脱一份照会，就“时代”周刊上述侮辱性文章向美国提出抗议。
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：玻利维亚政府2日就美国“时代”周刊侮辱玻利维亚一事向美国政府正式提出抗议。抗议的照会是由玻利维亚驻美大使曼努埃尔·巴劳交给美国代理国务卿赫脱的。
    据报道，巴劳在会见赫脱后对记者说：“时代”周刊登载的这篇文章对玻利维亚“极为有害”，玻利维亚正在等待美国的正式复照。
    又据报道说，玻利维亚执政党民族主义革命运动党呼吁拉丁美洲各国共同加强维护拉丁美洲的国际正义免受这家北美财阀政治的刊物的攻击。
    玻利维亚农业非常落后，每年需进口50％—70％的粮食，在玻利维亚的可耕地中，大地主和外国垄断资本家控制了70％—80％。1953年8月2日，玻利维亚政府在人民的压力下颁布了土地改革法。美国垄断资本为了使玻利维亚永远成为美国剩余农产品的市场，竟勾结玻利维亚国内大地主集团强迫玻利维亚政府不去执行关于土改的法令。
    美国垄断资本为加紧进行掠夺和剥削，于1956年12月强迫玻利维亚政府接受一个所谓稳定玻利维亚经济的埃德尔计划。这个由美国顾问起草的计划实施的结果使玻利维亚陷入严重的经济困难，玻利维亚的货币剧烈贬值，玻利维亚诺（玻币名）和美元的兑换比率从1952年的一百八十比一猛跌到1958年的一万一千比一；“埃德尔计划”还使得玻利维亚的生产萎缩，物价直线上涨。
    玻利维亚人民的生活在美国垄断资本控制日益加紧的情况下陷于水深火热之中。据美国“时代”周刊报道，玻利维亚是世界上生活费用最高的国家，从1945年到1957年第三季度，生活费用上涨到二千二百倍。玻利维亚工人的工资只有美国矿工工资4％。至于劳动条件，那更是万分恶劣。“纽约时报”一则消息说，“一切食物都是从国外进口的……60％的工人有肺病……50％的婴儿活不上一年，活下来的人平均寿命也只有三十五岁……没有医院，任何疾病或重伤都意味着死亡。”
    美国垄断资本给玻利维亚人民带来了无比的痛苦和灾难，所以玻利维亚人民不断地展开反对美国垄断资本的斗争。1958年3月11日，玻利维亚矿工联合会发动了全国性的罢工；同年4月22日，拉巴斯学生举行反美示威游行，抗议美国掠夺玻利维亚的石油资源；跟着在5月5日，尼克松到达拉巴斯时，玻利维亚人民又举行了一次大规模的反美示威，反帝爱国阵线散发的小册子说：“我们的国土是爱国的摇篮，是暴君和帝国主义的坟墓。”玻利维亚人民反对美国帝国主义的斗争在日益高涨。3月2日在拉巴斯爆发的反美示威标志着玻利维亚人民反美斗争的新的高涨。（美）
