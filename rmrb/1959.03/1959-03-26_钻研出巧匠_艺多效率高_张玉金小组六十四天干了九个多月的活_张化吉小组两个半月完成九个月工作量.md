　　Zhang Yujin Group Accomplishes Over Nine Months of Work in Sixty-Four Days
　　Zhang Huaji Group Completes Nine Months of Workload in Two and a Half Months

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Zhang Yujin forging team of the Forging Workshop of the Dalian Shipyard in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, recently overfulfilled the March Great Leap Forward plan in nine working days. As of March 18, this team had completed a workload of nine months and two days in sixty-four working days. Currently, the entire group proposes to respond to the call of the Party, create more outstanding achievements, and strive to go to Beijing to participate in the National Hero Conference.

　　The Zhang Yujin team, with a spirit of non-arrogance and non-impatience, continues to strive for greater leaps forward with greater enthusiasm. In addition to comprehensively preparing for production, all four members of the team work together to constantly study ways to improve production efficiency. Since March, they have already put forward five innovation proposals. On March 6, when forging sand dredging boat chain plates, they further improved the tools, creating a three-in-one tool to replace shims, pressure plates, and choppers, reducing the time spent changing tools, and increasing the chain plate output from 165 to 180 per shift.

　　The key product – the sixth-stage blade of a 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine – has always been a critical task in the workshop. In the past, working on this kind of job was not only inefficient, but also wasted valuable copper steel. In March, after receiving this task, they spent several days studying and created a groove for roughing blanks, shortening the time for pre-forging blanks and increasing production efficiency by 50%, from forging 130 blades per day in the past to 200. At the same time, due to the reduction in cutting heads, an average of 0.4 kilograms of copper steel can be saved per sixth-stage blade.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the Zhang Yujin team has been using the experience of the Great Leap Forward of last year to work more effectively with practicality, diligence, and ingenuity. In January, the team received a batch of tasks to process door handles for cargo ships. This work was very complicated. In the past, forging this type of work relied on manual tong operation, and each handle had to be reheated four or five times. Based on this calculation, this batch of tasks would take at least 270 man-hours to complete. Before starting forging, the team spent three days racking their brains and successfully developed four types of dies, using forging dies to replace manual operation. The complex structure of the door handles was formed with just a few hammer blows, increasing production efficiency by 2.4 times. As a result, this batch of tasks was completed in only 80 man-hours. Due to continuous painstaking research, the Zhang Yujin team created and reformed nearly 20 types of tools and dies from the beginning of the year to mid-February. The application of most of these in production has doubled production efficiency. The team's production preparation work has also become more detailed, minimizing production downtime. Before going to work, all team members divided their responsibilities to prepare materials, tools, and drawings, ensuring that nothing was missing and everything was available during the eight-hour production period. They also created some new methods to make production preparation more detailed. For example, they used the residual heat of the lower layer of the heating furnace to preheat the blanks, so that normal production could begin as soon as they started work, reducing the previous waiting time for materials. Some commonly used tools were changed from preparing one set to two sets, so that even if they were suddenly damaged, production would not be interrupted. Measuring tools of various specifications were also prepared in advance, eliminating the time wasted in measuring sizes as needed in the past. In this way, production downtime was further shortened, making full use of all effective time, which played a great role in further improving production. Because the Zhang Yujin team took these measures to work hard from the beginning of the year, the result was daily overproduction, with batches of tasks completed ahead of schedule, and production averaged two to seven times the work-hour quota. As a result, they completed half a year's workload in just thirty-eight working days.

　　After completing half a year's workload in thirty-eight working days at the beginning of this year, the team immediately proposed to advance victoriously and aim to complete three years' workload this year.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Zhang Huaji team of the Forging and Riveting Workshop of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory is making a major technical revolution, improving tools and equipment, improving technology and product design, and improving labor organization and operation methods. This year, they have already achieved thirty-one major technical reforms, mechanizing eighty-four manual operations, greatly improving labor productivity. Among these thirty-one reforms, the highest labor efficiency increased by 239 times, and the lowest increased by five times. As of March 15, the Zhang Huaji team had completed nine months of work in two and a half months.

　　Under the new situation of this year's greater leap forward, the tasks of the Zhang Huaji team have greatly increased compared with last year. In January, they had to complete the processing and manufacturing of nine components of 200 diesel engine housings and assemble the diesel tanks for 200 diesel engines; in February, they had to complete the processing tasks of six components of a large number of mobile grain dryers and assemble the diesel tanks of diesel engines; in March, they had to assemble 200 small diesel engine housings, assemble ten mobile grain dryer wheel spring plates, and perform a batch of component manufacturing tasks.

　　When discussing how to ensure the completion of this year's more arduous production tasks, some people believed that after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the potential had been fully tapped, and this year was the production of new products, with high technical requirements, and labor efficiency could not be further improved. In response to this understanding, the workshop Party branch organized the Zhang Huaji team to conscientiously summarize the experience of the first five-year plan, especially the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and further studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through summarizing experience and studying documents, all team members improved their understanding and overcame the idea of "leaping to the top." After discussion, the team formulated this year's leap forward plan: to ensure the completion of twenty-nine months of work in one year. After setting the targets, they also put forward measures, and the specific measures for completing the first quarter's tasks were: improving tools and equipment, improving technology and product design, improving labor organization and operation methods, making a major technical revolution, and improving labor productivity.

　　The Zhang Huaji team closely combined with the current production tasks and carried out technical reforms according to the characteristics of the products. The characteristics of the first quarter's tasks this year were that there were many new product components, many processes, and many manual operations. In order to simplify processes and use more machines to replace manual operations, they put forward the slogan "tool and die modernization, mechanization of manual operations," focusing on tool reform. Among the thirty-one technical innovations realized by the team, twenty-eight belonged to the reform of tools and dies. More than seventy production processes that required scissors, hammers, and pliers were replaced by die tools, enabling these processes to achieve mechanized production.

　　Diligence creates skilled craftsmen, and many skills lead to high efficiency. In order to continuously improve labor productivity, this team promoted "multi-skilled workers" so that one person could do the work of two or more people, changing the past phenomenon of one person only being able to do one type of work. The team's workers generally mastered multiple techniques such as forging, riveting, shearing, punching, pliers, and drilling, and one person could operate several processes at the same time, making full use of working hours. They also implemented component division of labor and contracting. Therefore, although there are many product varieties, complex technologies, and many processes this year, they can still complete the tasks excellently.

　　As a result of the Zhang Huaji team's major technical revolution, they had completed nine months of work by March 15. (Attached picture)

    钻研出巧匠　艺多效率高
    张玉金小组六十四天干了九个多月的活
    张化吉小组两个半月完成九个月工作量
    本报讯　旅大市大连造船厂锻冶车间张玉金锻工小组最近以九个工作日，超额完成了3月份跃进计划。截至3月18日止，这个小组以六十四个工作日，完成了九个月零两天的工作量。目前全组提出：要响应党的号召，创造更出色的成绩，争取上北京参加群英会。
    张玉金小组全组工人以不骄不躁的精神，用更大的干劲继续争取更大的跃进。他们除了全面地做好生产准备工作以外，全组四个人拧成一股绳，时刻研究提高生产效率的办法。3月份以来，他们已经提出了五件革新建议。3月6日，他们在锻造挖砂船链子板时，又进一步改进了工具，创造一种三用工具代替垫板、压板和剁刀，减少了上下换工具的时间，使链子板又由过去班产一百六十五个提高到一百八十个。
    重点产品——一千五百瓩汽轮机六级叶片，一直是车间的关键活，过去干这种活不但效率低，而且还浪费贵重的铜钢。3月份，他们接到这批任务后，经过几天研究，创造了一副打荒料的槽子，缩短了预锻荒料的时间，生产效率提高50％，由过去一天锻造一百三十个叶片，提高到二百个。同时，由于减少了剁头，平均每个六级叶片可以节约零点四公斤铜钢。
    张玉金小组从今年年初开始就运用去年大跃进的经验，更有成效地实干、苦干、巧干起来。这个组1月间接到一批加工货轮上门把手的任务，这个活很复杂，过去锻造这类活都是靠手工方法掌钳操作，加工一个得回四五次火，以此计算，这批任务最少也要二百七十个工时才能完成。小组在开始锻造之前，经过三天的苦心琢磨，研究成功四种胎具，用锻模代替了手工操作，门把手的复杂结构几锤就打了出来，使生产效率提高二点四倍，结果这批任务仅用八十个工时就完成了。张玉金小组由于不断苦心钻研，从年初到2月中旬共创造和改革工具、胎具近二十种，在生产中运用后大部分都使生产效率成倍地增长。这个小组的生产准备工作也越作越细，尽量减少生产间歇时间，全组工人在上班以前就分工负责把材料、工具、图纸准备齐全，保证在八小时的生产时间内一样不少，一件不缺外，并创造了一些新的办法，使生产准备进行得更加细致。例如：利用加热炉的下层余热，提前把毛坯加热，一上班就可以正常生产，减少了过去的等料时间；有些常用的工具，由原来准备一套改为二套，即使突然损坏也不致造成生产中断。各种规格的量具，也都提前准备好，消灭了过去现用现对尺码而浪费的时间。这样一来生产间歇时间更加缩短，做到了充分利用一切有效时间，对进一步提高生产起了很大作用。张玉金小组由于从年初就采取这些措施大干起来，结果是日日超产，批批任务提前完成，使生产平均都超过工时定额二倍到七倍，因此他们仅用三十八个工作日就完成了半年的工作量。
    这个组在今年初以三十八个工作日完成了半年工作量之后，当即提出乘胜前进，今年要达到完成三年工作量的目标。
    本报讯　吉林省农业机械厂锻铆车间张化吉小组大闹技术革命，改进工具和设备，改进工艺和产品设计，改进劳动组织和操作方法，今年来已经实现了三十一项重大技术改革，使八十四道手工操作的工序实现了机械化，大大地提高了劳动生产率。在这三十一项改革中，劳动效率最高的提高到二百三十九倍，最低的也提高了五倍。到3月15日为止，张化吉小组在两个半月里，已经完成了九个月的工作量。
    在今年更大跃进的新形势下，张化吉小组的任务比去年大大增加了，1月份要完成二百台柴油机箱的九种部件的加工制造任务和整装二百台柴油机的柴油箱；2月份要完成大批移动式谷物烘干机的六种部件的加工任务和柴油机柴油箱的整装；3月份要完成小装二百台柴油机箱，装配十台移动式谷物烘干机车轮弹板，还有一批部件制造任务。
    在讨论如何保证完成今年更繁重的生产任务的时候，曾有人认为，经过1958年的大跃进，潜力已经挖尽了，今年又是生产新产品，技术要求高，劳动效率没法再提高了。针对这种认识，车间党支部组织张化吉小组认真地总结了第一个五年计划特别是1958年大跃进的经验，进一步学习了党的八届六中全会文件。通过总结经验、学习文件，全组工人都提高了认识，克服了“跃进到顶”的思想。小组经过讨论之后，订出了今年的跃进计划：保证一年完成二十九个月的工作量。指标定了以后，又提出了措施，完成第一季度任务的具体措施是：改进工具、设备，改进工艺和产品设计，改进劳动组织和操作方法，大闹技术革命，提高劳动生产率。
    张化吉小组紧密结合当前生产任务，按照产品特点，进行了技术改革。今年第一季度任务的特点是，新产品部件多，工序多，手工操作多。他们为了简化工序和多用机器代替手工操作，就提出了“工具胎模化，手工操作机械化”的口号，把重点放在工具改革方面。全组实现的三十一项技术革新中，有二十八项是属于工具胎模的改革。有七十多道需要用剪子、锤子、钳子操作的生产工序，用胎模工具代替了，使这些工序实现了机械化生产。
    钻研出巧匠，艺多效率高。这个小组为了不断提高劳动生产率，一个人干两个人或者更多人的活，推行了“多面手”，改变了过去一个人只能做一种活的现象。全组工人普遍掌握了锻、铆、剪、冲、钳、钻等多种技术，并且一个人可以同时操作几道工序，充分地利用了工时，还实行了部件分工包干。因此，虽然今年产品品种多，技术复杂，工序多，也能出色地完成任务。
    张化吉小组由于大闹技术革命的结果，到3月15日为止，已经完成了九个月的工作量。（附图片）
