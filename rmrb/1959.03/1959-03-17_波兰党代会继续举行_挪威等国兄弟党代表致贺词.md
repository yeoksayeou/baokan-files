Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, after five days of discussion and one day of recess, continued its session today to discuss the reports by Gomulka, Jendrychowski, and Ochab.

    In the morning session today, Dechnik, secretary of the Bilgoraj County Committee of Lublin Province, spoke first. He said that in their county, the relationship between the masses and the Party has become closer because the Party members have set a brilliant example among the masses. Now, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has increased, and they have more confidence in agricultural production cooperatives.

    Next, Teichma, chairman of the Polish Rural Youth League, spoke. He believed that education on the socialist prospects of agriculture should be strengthened for young people. He concluded by saying that a general plan for educating young people should be formulated, and Party organizations should be concerned with the formulation and implementation of this plan.

    Mirostan, First Secretary of the Sroda County Committee of Poznan Province, talked about the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives in the county. He pointed out that the atmosphere of mistrust of socialist construction among peasants has been eliminated, and the idea of cooperation has been supported again in rural areas. His speech was warmly welcomed.

    Professor Wasilkowski, President of the Polish Supreme Court, spoke about the role and tasks of law and judicial trials. He said that strengthening the people's legal system not only includes protecting the individual rights of citizens, but also defending social interests and opposing waste and theft of public property. He particularly emphasized the need to be vigilant against the danger of bourgeois ideology infiltrating law.

    Żukrowski, the Polish Minister of Higher Education, said in his speech that we support the realization of everything with socialist characteristics in universities and oppose things that take young people away from socialism. He said that we should strengthen and expand ideological education for university students, and courses in political economy and philosophy should be established in universities. He also said that socialist ideological work must be strengthened, and future experts must meet our needs both technically and politically. The proportion of workers and peasants among university and secondary school students must be increased.

    The head of the Norwegian Communist Party delegation and vice-chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Lippe, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting. He pointed out that Adenauer's policies are a threat to peace. Norway's army has been controlled by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Norwegian people's struggle in this regard has become increasingly strong. He also said that Poland's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe has received the enthusiastic support of the Norwegian people. Our two parties will further strengthen solidarity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, on the basis of the struggle against revisionism, and on the basis of the struggle for peace.

    Subsequently, the head of the Belgian Communist Party delegation and Secretary of the Central Committee, Béren, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress, saying that the Belgian working people have been paying attention to your achievements in developing socialism, and are particularly concerned about Poland's efforts in opposing the revival of West German militarism and maintaining peace in Europe. He also said that the just struggle of the Congolese people and the workers' strikes in Belgium show that progressive forces are constantly growing.

    Łogha-Sowińsky, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, focused on the issue of wage policy in his speech. He said that the proportion of wages should be determined according to technical requirements, labor intensity and working hours, and according to the socialist principle of distribution, which should be conducive to the improvement of labor productivity. Labor quotas should be determined according to objective conditions. He said that labor quotas should not be regarded as the only means to improve production, and labor organization should also be improved. The principle of the reward system should enable employees to be more concerned about technological progress and labor productivity.

    Łogha-Sowińsky concluded by saying that our achievements in developing the economy and improving people's living standards are also a contribution to consolidating the socialist camp.

    Koviolekk, First Secretary of the Warsaw Municipal Committee of the Polish Socialist Youth League, pointed out at the meeting that some reactionary forces and the church are trying to make young people hate socialism. He called for strengthening political and ideological work among young people. Party organizations should care about the thoughts and lives of young people and should recognize the importance of educating young people. He particularly emphasized the influence of Party members' exemplary actions on young people.

    The head of the Danish Communist Party delegation and member of the Central Executive Committee of the Danish Communist Party, Willy Karlsson, said in his congratulatory message to the congress that West German militarism not only threatens the security of socialist countries, but also threatens small countries in the Atlantic Group. Our people oppose our government's negotiations with West Germany on handing over our army to West German control. He also said that revisionists are trying to cause divisions within the Danish Communist Party, but their attacks have been crushed.

    Next, the head of the Indonesian Communist Party delegation and Deputy Secretary-General, Lukman, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress. He said that the strengthening of economic relations between Poland and Indonesia greatly helps Indonesia resist imperialist aggression. The Indonesian people are a resolute force against colonialism. The Indonesian Communist Party supports the current patriotic government.

    He concluded by saying that the Indonesian Communist Party hopes to arm its members with Marxism-Leninism to oppose the danger of revisionism.

    The head of the Cuban People's Socialist Party delegation and President of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, Juan Marinello, received a warm welcome when he delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress. He said that the victory of Cuba cannot be regarded as an isolated phenomenon, but is an event of great significance to the world. The Cuban revolutionary movement marks a serious blow to US imperialism and marks a change in the balance of domestic revolutionary forces. This victory was achieved because the Cuban revolution has a profound popular character.

    He said that our party supports the current government, first of all, supports the rebel army. The actions of the current government are in line with the interests of the people. He also said that the Cuban revolution does not mean that the final victory has been achieved, and imperialists are still trying to attack. We have not yet completed the tortuous road. He said that when we were in the most difficult period, socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China gave us great support, and we deeply felt the preciousness of this fraternal friendship. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to Poland for its support of the Cuban revolution.

    The morning session passed a list of a drafting committee of fifty-four people for the "Instructions on the Party's Agricultural Policy."

    The morning session ended here. The meeting continued in the afternoon.

    波兰党代会继续举行
    挪威等国兄弟党代表致贺词
    新华社华沙16日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会经过五天讨论和一天休会之后，今天继续开会，讨论哥穆尔卡、英德里霍夫斯基和奥哈布的报告。
    在今天上午会议上卢布林省比尔戈莱县委员会书记德赫尼克首先发言。他说，在他们的县里，由于党员在群众中做出了光辉的榜样，群众同党的关系更加密切了。现在，农民的生产积极性提高了，他们对农业生产合作社更加信任了。
    接着，波兰农村青年联盟主席泰赫马发言。他认为，应该对青年加强进行农业社会主义远景的教育。他最后说，应该制定教育青年的总的计划，党组织应当关心这个计划的制定和执行。
    波兹南省斯罗达县委员会第一书记米洛斯坦谈到了这个县的农业生产合作社的发展和巩固的情况。他指出，农民对社会主义建设不信任的气氛已经消除，合作化思想重新在农村中得到支持。他的发言受到了热烈的欢迎。
    波兰最高法院院长瓦西尔科夫斯基教授在发言中谈到了法学和司法审讯的作用和任务问题。他说，加强人民法制不仅包括保护公民个人权利，也包括保卫社会利益，反对浪费和盗窃公共财产。他特别提出应当对资产阶级思想渗透到法学的危险保持警惕。
    波兰高等教育部部长祖凯夫斯基在发言中说，我们在高等学校中支持实现一切具有社会主义特点的东西，反对使青年离开社会主义的东西。他说，我们应该加强和扩大对大学青年的思想教育，大学中应该设立政治经济学和哲学课程。他又说，必须加强社会主义思想工作，并使未来的专家们在技术和政治上都符合我们的需要。必须提高高等学校和中等学校学生的工农成份。
    挪威共产党代表团团长、挪共副主席利佩在会上致贺词。他指出，阿登纳的政策是对和平的威胁。挪威的军队已被北大西洋公约组织所控制。挪威人民在这方面的斗争已愈来愈加强。他又说，波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器区的计划获得了挪威人民的热烈支持。我们两党在马克思列宁主义的基础上、在同修正主义进行斗争的基础上，在为和平而斗争的基础上将进一步加强团结。
    随后比利时共产党代表团团长、中央委员会书记贝伦向大会致贺词说，比利时劳动人民一直注视着你们在发展社会主义中所取得的成就，特别关心波兰在反对西德军国主义复活和维护欧洲和平方面所作出的努力。他又说，刚果人民的正义斗争和比利时国内的工人罢工说明了进步力量在不断成长。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、工会中央理事会主席洛加—索文斯基在发言中着重谈到了工资政策问题。他说，工资的比例应当根据技术要求、劳动强度和工作时间，根据社会主义的分配原则来确定，应该有利于劳动生产率的提高。劳动定额应该根据客观条件来规定。他说，不能把工资定额视为提高生产的唯一的手段，还应该改进劳动组织。奖励制度的原则应当使职工能更加关心技术进步和劳动生产率的提高。
    洛加—索文斯基最后说，我们在发展经济和提高人民生活水平方面的成就，也是对巩固社会主义阵营的贡献。
    波兰社会主义青年联盟华沙市委员会第一书记科威奥列克在会上指出，一些反动势力和教会企图使青年仇恨社会主义，他要求加强对青年的政治思想工作，党组织应该关心青年的思想和生活，应该认识到教育青年问题的重要性。他特别强调党员的模范行动对青年的影响。
    丹麦共产党代表团团长、丹共中央执行委员会委员威利·卡尔逊在向大会致祝词时说，西德的军国主义不但威胁着社会主义国家的安全，也威胁着大西洋集团中的小国家。我国人民反对我国政府同西德进行关于把我国军队交西德控制的谈判。他又说，修正主义者企图在丹麦共产党内引起分裂，但他们的进攻已被粉碎。
    接着，印度尼西亚共产党代表团团长、副总书记鲁克曼向大会致祝词。他说，波兰同印度尼西亚的经济关系的加强，大大有助于印度尼西亚抵抗帝国主义者侵略。印度尼西亚人民是反殖民主义的坚决力量。印度尼西亚共产党支持现在的爱国政府。
    他最后说，印度尼西亚共产党希望用马克思列宁主义武装自己的党员，以反对修正主义的危险。
    古巴人民社会党代表团团长、古巴人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略向大会致贺词时受到了热烈的欢迎。他说，不能把古巴的胜利当作一个孤立的现象，这是对全世界都有巨大意义的事件。古巴的革命运动标志着对美帝国主义的严重打击，标志着国内革命力量对比的改变。获得这个胜利是由于古巴的革命具有深刻的人民性。
    他说，我们党支持现政府，首先是支持起义部队。现政府的行动是同人民的利益一致的。他又说，古巴革命并不意味着已获得最后胜利，帝国主义者还在设法进攻，我们还没有走完曲折的道路。他说，当我们处在最困难的时期里，苏联、中国等社会主义国家给了我们巨大支持，我们深刻感到这种兄弟友谊的可贵。最后他对波兰对古巴革命的支持表示感谢。
    上午会议通过了由五十四人组成的“党的农业政策指示”起草委员会的名单。
    上午会议至此结束。下午继续开会。
