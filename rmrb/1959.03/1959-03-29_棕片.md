    Palm fiber is a kind of soft, resilient, water-resistant fiber that does not easily rot, stripped from palm trees. Palm fiber has a wide range of uses in agriculture, fishing, handicrafts, transportation, aquaculture, and basic construction. It can also be processed into palm silk for export.
    Palm fiber is mainly produced in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi and other provinces. The employees of the Luzhou Prefecture Native Produce Wholesale Station of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce, based on the principle of degumming wild fibers to make cotton, use the previously discarded palm frond petioles, processing them into palm silk after boiling in alkali. The quality is good and can completely replace ordinary palm silk. (Attached picture)

    棕片
    棕片是从棕树上剥下的一种性柔软、有韧力、耐水、经久不会腐烂的纤维。棕片的用途很广，农业、渔业、手工业、运输业、水产业，以及基本建设都需要，还可加工成棕丝出口。
    棕片主要出产在四川、贵州、云南、湖南、湖北、陕西等省。四川省商业厅泸州专区土产批发站的职工，根据野生纤维脱胶制棉的原理，利用过去废弃不用的棕树叶柄，经碱煮后加工成棕丝，品质良好，完全可以代替一般棕丝使用。（附图片）
