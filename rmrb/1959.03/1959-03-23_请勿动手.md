    "Please Do Not Touch"
    Zhang Yun, Department of Finance, Renmin University
    In the past, almost all exhibits at various exhibitions had a white paper sign that said "Please Do Not Touch." Of course, this was necessary to protect the exhibits from damage and dirt, and it also served as a certain restriction on those unconscious visitors who liked to touch things indiscriminately. However, whether every exhibit needs this is worth considering.
    My visit to the National Agricultural Exhibition gave me a lot of enlightenment in this regard. In this exhibition, except for some indoor exhibits that are easily damaged and soiled, visitors are not allowed to touch them casually. The various machines, especially improved farm tools, exhibited outdoors not only did not restrict visitors from touching them, but also arranged a wide space for visitors to try them out for themselves.
    On the day I visited, I personally saw some Young Pioneers treading on waterwheels, a group of engineering students moving the farmer's homemade ramming machine to analyze its lever principle, and two international friends also trying out the water press. Representatives of farmers from the suburbs showed great interest in various soil transporting machines, trying this and that, which added a lot of lively atmosphere to the exhibition.
    I hope that the departments holding various exhibitions in the future will put more effort into this aspect, and make arrangements to allow the audience to use their hands when possible, and boldly let go. This can sometimes save the labor of the guides, and the effect will be greater. Of course, we must also strengthen the publicity and education of the audience on cherishing national property and ensuring a certain order.

### “请勿动手”

    “请勿动手”
    人民大学财政系　章云
    以前各种展览会上，几乎所有的展品上都挂上了一张“请勿动手”的白纸条。当然这对保护展品不受损污是必要的，特别对那些不自觉的喜欢乱摸乱动的参观者来说也起着一定限制作用的。但是否每件展品都要这样，却是值得考虑的。
    这次参观了全国农业展览会在这方面给了我不少启示。这个展览会里除了室内的一些易损污的展品不许随便动手外，室外展出的各种机械特别是改良农具，不仅不限制观众动手，而且还安排了一个宽广的场所，让参观者能亲手试一下。
    我参观那天就亲眼看到一些少先队员们在踏着水车，一群工科大学生在搬弄着农民土制的打夯机分析其杠杆原理，有两个国际友人也在那儿试压轧水机，近郊农民代表对各种运土机发生了浓厚的兴趣，这个试了那个试，给展览会增添了不少热闹气氛。
    希望今后举办各种展览会的部门，要在这方面多下些功夫，能够让观众动动手的，就作些安排，大胆放手，这样有时也可以节省讲解员的劳动，效果将更大。当然也要加强对观众进行爱护国家财物的宣传教育和保证一定的秩序。
