Golden Oranges Transformed into Ten Thousand Tons of Steel
Anshan Iron and Steel Company Deputy Manager Gu Zhengrong

The People's Daily supplement on February 21st published the poem "Ode to Spring Oranges" written by Comrade Ruan Zhangjing in Baotou. The poet said: He has already transferred three golden oranges as a gift to Anshan Iron and Steel. Anshan Iron and Steel received this precious gift at the beginning of February. These three golden oranges, which came from Yunnan and traveled from all directions, symbolize the close unity of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao in socialist construction. All the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel thank the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country for their concern, and thank the Baotou Iron and Steel brothers for their deep friendship. In addition to resolutely guaranteeing the early completion of this year's steel task to answer the encouragement and concern of the Party and the people for us, everyone decided to dedicate these three golden oranges to the 600 million people.
　　The spring breeze blows, a hundred flowers bloom, golden oranges fly into the steel capital.
　　A thousand people hear it, a thousand people praise it, ten thousand people see it, ten thousand people love it.
　　Flowers bloom for thousands of miles, fragrance spreads for ten thousand miles, golden oranges are more fragrant than flowers,
　　The sky is full of stars, the ground is full of light, golden oranges are brighter than stars.
　　Kunming's spring scenery is the most charming, golden oranges are even stronger than the spring scenery;
　　The affection between flesh and blood is the deepest, golden oranges are even more affectionate.
　　The sky moves, the earth shakes, miracles fly to the ninth heaven,
　　Golden oranges bring the affection of mountains and seas, flying east, west, north and south.
　　Presenting Ruyi in Zhongnanhai, sending good luck in front of Tiananmen,
　　Going to the East China Sea front to congratulate, asking about the steel city outside the Great Wall.
　　Ten thousand lines are strung by golden oranges, six hundred million hearts are linked by golden oranges.
　　Every line leads to Beijing, every heart faces the Communist Party.
　　Beat the war drums, blow the bugles, whip the horse faster on the Yangguan Road,
　　Steel soldiers are all dispatched, holding up golden oranges for a great leap forward.
　　Mine salute cannons are better than spring thunder, blast furnaces spew molten iron,
　　Steel flowers dance, reflecting the sky red, golden dragons fly under the rolling mill.
　　The guiding light shines in the sky, the steel capital people express their determination,
　　Thank you for the heavy affection of the golden oranges, vowing to report the good news early.
　　Fiery golden oranges warm people's hearts, transforming into tens of millions of tons of steel,
　　Dedicated to the leader Chairman Mao, dedicated to the heroic 600 million people!
