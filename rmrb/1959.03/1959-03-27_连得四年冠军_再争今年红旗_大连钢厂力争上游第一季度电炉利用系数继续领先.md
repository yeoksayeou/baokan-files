People's Daily, Lüda, March 26th: The Dalian Steel Plant has been vigorously promoting mass movements for four years and continuously carrying out technical revolutions. Since 1955, the average utilization coefficient of its electric furnaces has consistently maintained a leading position in the country. In the first quarter of this year, it once again led the country, launching the first salvo in its quest to win the championship for the fifth year.

The main factors for Dalian Steel Plant's acquisition of the high-yield red banner for electric furnaces, and its ever-increasing success, are the result of mobilizing the masses to continuously carry out technological innovation movements around the three major elements of improving the utilization coefficient: shortening smelting time, increasing operating rate, and increasing charging capacity. Before 1955, the plant only had old-style electric furnaces with manual charging, which took a long time. The utilization coefficient was only around 10. The workers were determined to change this situation of great effort and little return. Taking advantage of the opportunity of major repairs, they used their own strength to change manual charging to mechanical charging, thereby shortening the charging time per furnace from 20 minutes to 2 minutes. On this basis, the utilization coefficient in 1955 was greatly improved, and it achieved a leading position in the country. However, they were still not satisfied with the status quo, and under the condition of not requiring national capital construction investment, they continuously improved equipment and operating methods with a spirit of hard work and diligent study. In the past, the furnace wall of the electric furnace would generally be corroded after being used for ten days or so, requiring a shutdown of seven or eight hours for intermediate repairs. The workers felt that this affected the operation too much, so they researched a standby furnace body method: when a working furnace needed intermediate repairs, they used a crane to lift the entire furnace body out for repair, and then replaced it with a standby furnace body to continue production in just ten minutes. In this way, the operating rate was increased. During the Great Leap Forward last year, while studying the Soviet method of electric oxygen steelmaking, the plant creatively adopted the method of injecting gas. The new "three-gas steelmaking method" technology, which strengthens smelting, shortened the smelting time of one furnace of steel by several tens of minutes, and created conditions for expanding the charging capacity and exploiting the potential of the transformer.

While carrying out competitions within the plant, Dalian Steel Plant also carried out friendly competitions with fraternal steel plants. In the fourth quarter of last year, the utilization coefficient of Benxi Steel Plant surpassed that of Dalian Steel Plant. After the news came, all the workers in the plant immediately held meetings in the workshop to study how to learn from the advanced experience of fraternal plants and further improve the utilization coefficient. After several days of efforts, they created four national records in a row, and finally surpassed Benxi Steel Plant again. (Attached picture)

### 连得四年冠军　再争今年红旗  大连钢厂力争上游第一季度电炉利用系数继续领先

    连得四年冠军　再争今年红旗
    大连钢厂力争上游第一季度电炉利用系数继续领先
    本报旅大26日电　大连钢厂四年如一日地大搞群众运动，不断开展技术革命，从1955年以来，电炉平均利用系数连续保持了全国领先地位；今年第一季度又在全国领先，为夺得第五年的冠军打响了第一炮。
    大连钢厂获得电炉高产红旗，并且越举越高的主要因素，是发动群众围绕着提高利用系数的三大要素——缩短熔炼时间、提高作业率和加多装料量，不断地开展技术革新运动的结果。这个厂1955年前只有人工装料的旧式电炉，装料时间长，利用系数只有10左右，职工们决心改变这种费力大、收成小的情况，趁大修的机会，用自己的力量，把人工装料改为机械装料，从而装一炉料的时间由二十分钟缩短到两分钟。在这个基础上，1955年的利用系数即有了很大提高，取得了在全国领先的地位。但是，他们仍不满足现状，在不要国家基本建设投资的条件下，以苦钻勤学的精神，不断改进设备和操作方法。电炉炉壁过去一般使用十几天就被腐蚀坏，需要停产七、八小时进行中修，职工们觉得这样太影响作业，就研究出备用炉体的办法：当工作着的炉子需要中修的时候，用吊车把它整个炉体吊出去修理，只用十分钟的时间，再换上备用炉体继续生产。这样，就提高了作业率。去年大跃进中，这个厂在学习苏联电气加氧气炼钢的同时，又创造性地采用了吹入煤气的方法。强化冶炼的“三气炼钢法”新技术，使一炉钢的熔炼时间缩短了数十分钟，并且为扩大装料量、发挥变压器潜力，创造了条件。
    大连钢厂在厂内开展竞赛的同时，也同兄弟钢厂开展了友谊竞赛。去年第四季度，本溪钢厂利用系数赶过大连钢厂。消息传来以后，全厂职工立即在车间召开会议，研究如何学习兄弟厂的先进经验，进一步提高利用系数。经过几天的努力，就连创四次全国纪录，终于又赶过本溪钢厂。（附图片）
