Raising Pigs is Like Raising Children
Ma Fengying, Commune Member of Qianwei Commune, Guandu District, Kunming

    I am a feeder at the pig farm of Qingquan Brigade, Qianwei People's Commune, Guandu District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province. In February of last year, our cooperative built a pig farm and transferred me to raise pigs. The two of us raised forty pigs, earning eight work points a day. The work is very satisfactory. However, I also have three children, which sometimes inevitably affects my work. The eldest child goes to school, but the second and third children have to be carried on my back or in my arms. Every morning, I go to the pig farm to mix pig feed and then come back to cook. After eating breakfast, it's already noon, and then I go back to the pig farm. When I get home in the evening, I have to start cooking again. This way, my heart is divided in two, and although I want to take better care of the pigs in the commune, it's hard to do.

    At the end of last year, the commune was established, and life became different. The commune set up public canteens and nurseries, so I don't have to cook anymore. Every morning when I get up to fetch water, I conveniently take the children to the nursery and can go to work with peace of mind. In the evening, I bring the children back. I think raising pigs is like raising children, relying entirely on careful care, so I simply moved to the pig farm to live. When a sow is in heat, it should be mated in time; when a sow is about to give birth, I move it to a nearby pen so I can get up and take care of it at night. Our pig farm has also been expanded, and a neat pigsty has been built, and we also have a veterinarian. The pigs I am raising now, one sow gave birth to thirteen in one litter, and each little pig is growing up sleek and shiny, truly lovable. (Attached picture)

    养猪就像带娃娃
    昆明官渡区前卫公社社员  马凤英
    我是云南省昆明市官渡区前卫人民公社清泉大队养猪场的饲养人员。去年2月间，我们合作社建起了养猪场，调我来养猪。我们两个人，养了四十头猪，一日评八个工分。工作很称心。可就是，我还拖着三个娃娃，有时不免影响工作。大娃娃上学了，第二、第三个娃娃还得背着抱着。每日早晨，我到养猪场去拌猪食，回来才做饭。吃完早饭就到十二点了，又到养猪场去。晚上回家时，又摸锅摸灶做饭。这样，心分成了两半，虽然想把社里的猪照料得更好，也难办到。
    去年底成立了公社，日子可就不同啦。社里办起了公共食堂和托儿所，自己不用摸锅摸灶。每日早上起床挑水时我顺便把娃娃送进托儿所，就放心去工作。晚上，才把娃娃接回来。我想，养猪好比带小娃一样，全靠人细心照料，就索性搬到养猪场去住。那只母猪发情了，应该及时配种，那只母猪该生小猪了，就把它移到靠近的栏里来住，晚上也好起来照顾。我们的养猪场也扩大了，修了个整整齐齐的猪厩，又有了兽医。我现在养的猪，有一头猪一窝就生了十三个，一个个小猪都长得油光水滑的，真惹人爱。（附图片）
