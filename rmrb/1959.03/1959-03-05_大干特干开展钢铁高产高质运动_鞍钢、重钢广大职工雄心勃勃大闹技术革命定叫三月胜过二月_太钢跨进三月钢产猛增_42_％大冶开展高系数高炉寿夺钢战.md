Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines continue to carry out high-yield and high-quality competitions, striving for a complete victory in steel production in March and the first quarter.

The output of high-quality steel in Anshan Iron and Steel's various steelmaking plants in February surpassed that of January, with an average daily output increase of more than 1,200 tons compared to January. Steelworkers have recently discussed and arranged production plans for March, determined to advance victoriously and show their skills in March, overfulfilling the monthly plan on a daily and ten-day basis. The "Open Hearth Furnace King" – No. 24 open hearth furnace, which was put into production last year, saw its average daily output increase by more than 14% in February compared to January. The workers on this open hearth furnace decided to adopt measures such as frequent and thorough blowing of the furnace roof, thoroughly patching the front and rear walls, and maintaining the slag outlet to ensure that the "Open Hearth Furnace King" produces more high-quality steel in March. The famous Youth Friendship Furnace – No. 1 open hearth furnace, created a new record for furnace bottom utilization coefficient since the plant's opening in February. They are determined to further increase the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces to 50% in March by doing more charging and rapid refining, low-carbon batching, adding molten iron at the end of melting, and expanding the charging volume, maintaining an average furnace bottom utilization coefficient of over twelve tons.

Workers at the ironmaking plant are determined to make great strides in March. The workers of No. 2 and No. 9 blast furnaces, who were at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward in February, recently held meetings and discussions, identified key issues, proposed measures, and set targets, once again launching a competition to seize the factory's red flag. In order to regain the factory's red flag in March, the workers of No. 9 blast furnace launched a movement for everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions, and each shift strengthened operational analysis to continuously improve production levels. The No. 10 giant blast furnace, which was put into production in November last year, demonstrated its great power in February, with smelting intensity increasing from 0.779 to 0.89, and overfulfilling the monthly plan by 3,000 tons of high-quality pig iron. All the workers in the furnace have increased their confidence and guarantee that the average daily output in March will increase by 130 tons compared to February, increasing the nation's pig iron production by 4,000 tons for the whole month.

Chongqing, this newspaper, 4th. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company further mobilized its workers, combined the summary of February's production experience, earnestly discussed the March production plan, and adopted a series of effective measures to seize the completion of the March production task, ensuring the comprehensive completion of the first quarter's national plan.

In February, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company launched a mass high-yield and high-quality movement throughout the company, centered on combating high-sulfur local iron, achieving a double leap forward in output and quality. Steel exceeded the national plan by 11.8%. This has created favorable conditions for completing the March production plan. The company's March production task is much heavier than in February. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the first quarter's national plan, the company's Party committee mobilized workers to discuss the March production plan on the basis of summarizing February's production experience. After clarifying their tasks and direction of efforts, the vast number of workers actively contributed ideas and suggestions, and proposed specific measures and guarantees.

The central key to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's completion of the March task is to continue the fight against high-sulfur local iron. According to the workers' discussion opinions, in addition to continuing to adopt February's rich experience in desulfurization, the company has also adopted an effective desulfurization method of building more iron melting furnaces to produce more "regenerated iron." Now the company has utilized all iron melting furnaces to produce "regenerated iron," and organized more than 500 people to build another batch of iron melting furnaces to participate in "regenerated iron" production, supporting the completion of the steelmaking task.

In terms of technical management, the company has also taken a series of measures. In addition to giving full play to the production potential of existing equipment and strengthening the maintenance and repair of equipment, the main thing is to mobilize workers to carry out technical revolution, improve furnace output, and extend the life of the furnace. No. 2 small open hearth furnace has been urgently repaired to make various parts of the furnace more reasonable, so as to meet the needs of high yield and high quality.

The company's Party committee and the Party organizations of various factories and workshops have strengthened political and ideological work. At present, all cadres in the company go to the workshop to follow shifts and participate in labor at fixed times and locations according to their business nature, discover problems and improve business through labor; at the same time, they further organize workers to participate in the high-yield and high-quality competition movement to ensure the completion of the March plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th. The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company vowed to strive for a complete success in the first quarter's production and launched a competition upsurge to fight a great battle in March. In the first three days of March, new achievements in production and construction have continued to emerge, and the production level and construction speed have significantly improved compared to February. Under the slogan of iron driving the overall situation, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's average daily output of pig iron in the first three days of March increased by more than 100 tons compared to February; the average daily production level of steel increased by 42% compared to February.

On February 27th, Taiyuan City held a city-wide industrial Great Leap Forward oath-taking meeting with 3,500 Great Leap Forward models participating. The meeting proposed to the city's industrial front workers to carry out a competition comparing indicators, measures, enthusiasm, and awareness. After this proposal was conveyed to Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the workers immediately sought measures and innovated technologies to ensure the complete realization of the first quarter's plan, focusing on the current key production issues. After the Second Steelmaking Plant of the company conveyed the proposal of the Great Leap Forward oath-taking meeting to the workers on the 28th, the Zhang Hui group of Class A and the Yang Pengtu group of Class C of No. 1 furnace closely cooperated on the same night and created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in seven hours and thirty minutes, which was one hour and twenty-five minutes shorter than usual. In order to solve the current problem of insufficient supply of steel ingot molds, the workers automatically organized a hard-fought commando team of more than 100 people, repaired more than 80 old steel ingot molds in their spare time, creating good conditions for more steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th. The workers of Daye Steel Plant have entered the "Steel Seizing Battle" of high yield, high quality, high coefficient, and high furnace life in March, laying the foundation for ensuring the completion of this year's overall production Great Leap Forward plan.

Since the beginning of the year, this factory has realized more than 100 technical innovation proposals put forward by the workers, making production gradually rise. Compared with January, the average daily output of steel in February increased by 13%, steel increased by 25%, the quality of steel and steel has generally improved, and pig iron completed the first quarter's plan more than a month ahead of schedule. However, the steelmaking aspect cannot fully meet the needs of the rolling mill with sufficient steel ingots. The factory's Party committee analyzed this situation and decided to focus on steelmaking, mobilize all factory workers to propose measures and offer suggestions, and launch a major competition to encircle and suppress key production issues, striving to overfulfill the March steelmaking plan and various other production plans that are adapted to it. All factory workers responded to the Party's call and are actively finding the key problems of their units and the solutions. The First Steelmaking Department has implemented classified management of raw materials, summarized and promoted the "high-temperature thin patching" furnace repair experience and the ingot casting operation experience of the Guo Yanjian team, and increased equipment such as steel ladle, iron ladle, and slag discharge tank, preparing to further increase the proportion of hot-charged molten iron, and implement double-ladle steel tapping to facilitate desulfurization and increase output. The Second Steelmaking Department has also tried to increase the brick pressing machine and wind hammer for making converter linings to further improve the output and quality of the linings and ensure the normal blowing of the converter. According to the situation that the heating furnace capacity is smaller than the rolling mill, the workers of the Rolling Steel Department are promoting the experience of "more charging, fast charging, and hot charging" on the furnace, shortening the heating time, further realizing "multi-strip rapid rolling" on the rolling mill; at the same time, they are actively preparing to put a new set of small continuous rolling mills into production in March.

    大干特干开展钢铁高产高质运动
    鞍钢、重钢广大职工雄心勃勃大闹技术革命定叫三月胜过二月
    太钢跨进三月钢产猛增42％大冶开展高系数高炉寿夺钢战
    据新华社鞍山4日电　鞍钢各厂矿职工继续开展高产优质竞赛，力争3月份和第一季度的钢铁生产获得全面胜利。
    鞍钢各炼钢厂2月份优质钢产量胜过1月份，平均日产量比1月份增长一千二百多吨。炼钢工人最近几天讨论和安排了3月份生产计划，决心乘胜前进，在3月份要大显身手，按日、按旬地超额完成全月计划。去年新投入生产的“平炉王”——二十四号平炉，2月份平均日产量比1月份增产14％以上。这座平炉上的职工决定采取对炉顶勤吹、彻底吹，以及彻底贴补前后墙、维护好出渣口等办法，保证让“平炉王”在3月份内生产出更多的优质钢。著名的青年友谊炉——一号平炉，在2月份创造了全厂开工以来的炉底利用系数新纪录，他们决心在3月份进一步做到多装快炼、低炭配料、溶化末期兑铁水、扩大装入量，使快速炼钢炉数增加到50％，平均炉底利用系数保持在十二吨以上。
    炼铁厂工人决心在3月份迈开大步前进。2月份跑在跃进前列的二号、九号高炉的工人们，最近分别集会座谈，找关键、提措施、订指标，再次掀起了夺取全厂红旗的竞赛。九号高炉的职工为了在3月份重新夺回全厂的红旗，展开了人人献计献策运动，各个班都加强操作分析，使生产水平不断提高。去年11月间投入生产的十号巨型高炉，2月份发挥了巨大威力，冶炼强度由零点七七九提高到零点八九，全月比计划增产了三千吨优质生铁。全炉职工信心倍增，保证3月份平均日产量比2月份增加一百三十吨，全月为国家增产生铁四千吨。
    本报重庆4日电　重庆钢铁公司进一步深入发动职工，结合总结2月份生产经验，认真讨论3月份生产计划，采取一系列有效措施，全力抓紧完成3月份生产任务，确保全面完成第一季度国家计划。
    重庆钢铁公司在2月份内，在全公司开展了一个群众性的以战胜土铁高硫为中心的高产高质运动，产量、质量双跃进。钢材超额11.8％完成了国家计划。为完成3月份的生产计划创造了有利条件。这个公司3月份的生产任务比2月份繁重得多。为了确保第一季度国家计划的全面完成，公司党委发动职工在总结2月份生产经验的基础上，对3月份生产计划展开讨论。广大职工在明确了自己的任务和努力方向后，纷纷献计、献策，提出具体的措施和保证。
    重庆钢铁公司完成3月份任务的中心关键仍然是继续与土铁高硫作斗争。公司根据职工讨论意见，除了继续采用2月份脱硫的丰富经验外，又采取了大建化铁炉多搞“再生铁”的有效脱硫办法。现在公司已把所有化铁炉都利用起来生产“再生铁”，并组织五百多人再建一批化铁炉，参加“再生铁”生产，支援炼钢任务的完成。
    在技术管理方面，公司也采取了一系列措施，除充分发挥现有设备的生产潜力，加强对设备的维护、检修外，主要是发动职工大搞技术革命，提高炉产量和延长炉子的寿命。二号小平炉已抓紧进行大中修，使炉子的各个部分更合理，以适应高产高质的需要。
    公司党委和各厂、车间的党组织都加强了政治思想工作。目前，全公司干部都根据自己业务性质定时定点下车间跟班参加劳动，通过劳动发现问题，改进业务；同时，进一步组织工人参加高产、高质竞赛运动，保证完成3月份的计划。
    据新华社太原4日电　太原钢铁公司的职工誓争第一季度生产满堂红，展开了大战三月的竞赛热潮。3月份的头三天，生产建设的新成就就已不断出现，生产水平和建设速度都比2月份显著提高。太原钢铁公司在以铁带全面的口号下，3月头三天，生铁的平均日产量比2月份增加了一百多吨；钢的平均日产水平比2月份增长了42％。
    太原市在2月27日召开了有三千五百名跃进模范参加的全市工业跃进誓师大会，会议向全市工业战线职工提出了开展比指标、比措施、比干劲、比觉悟的竞赛倡议，这一倡议传到太原钢铁公司后，职工们针对当前生产关键问题，立即找寻措施，革新技术，以确保第一季度计划的完满实现。这个公司的第二炼钢厂在28日向职工们传达了跃进誓师大会的倡议以后，当天晚上一号炉甲班张辉小组和丙班杨鹏图小组，就紧密配合，创造了七小时三十分炼一炉钢的新纪录，这个时间比平时缩短了一小时二十五分。为了解决当前钢锭模供不应求的问题，职工们自动组织了一百多人参加的苦战突击队，在业余时间修好了八十多个旧的钢锭模，为多出钢创造了良好条件。
    新华社武汉4日电　大冶钢厂职工已经进入了3月份高产、高质、高系数、高炉寿的“夺钢大战”，为确保完成今年全年生产跃进计划打下基础。
    这个厂开年以来已经实现了职工们提出的一百多项技术革新建议，使生产逐步上升。以2月份的平均日产量与1月份比较，钢增长13％，钢材增长25％，钢和钢材的质量普遍提高，生铁更是提前一个多月完成了第一季度的计划。但目前炼钢方面还不能以充分的钢锭满足轧机的需要。工厂党委分析了这一情况，决定以炼钢为中心，发动全厂职工提措施、献计策，开展围攻生产关键问题的大竞赛，力争超额完成3月份的炼钢计划和其他相适应的各种生产计划。全厂职工响应党的号召，都在积极找出本单位的关键问题和解决的措施。第一炼钢部已实行了原料分类管理，总结和推广了“高温薄补”的补炉经验和郭颜见班的铸锭操作经验，同时增加了钢水包、铁水包和出渣罐等设备，准备进一步提高热装铁水的比例，并实行双包出钢，以利于脱硫和提高产量。第二炼钢部，也设法增加了制作转炉炉衬的压砖机、风锤，进一步提高炉衬的产量和质量，保证转炉正常吹炼。轧钢部职工根据均热炉能力小于轧钢机的情况，在炉子上推行“多装、快装、热装”的经验，缩短加热时间，进一步在轧机上实现“多条快速轧制”；同时积极准备把新建的一套小型连轧机在3月里投入生产。（附图片）
