Barren Hills Transformed into Paradise
—A Record of the New Look of Bamianshan in Longshan County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
By our reporter Chen Yongchu

With a long-standing admiration, I visited Bamianshan in Longshan County, Xiangxi. After breakfast, we began to climb the mountain, and it was noon when we reached the waist of Bamianshan. At this time, we saw clouds gently moving beside us, and spring water gushing from the cliffs flowed downwards like jade belts. On the You River surrounding the foot of the mountain, a few small boats floated like leaves. The main peak of Bamianshan, hidden deep in the clouds, was even more majestic and magnificent against the backdrop of natural beauty. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we reached the summit. What appeared before us was a boundless field, ninety li long and fifteen li wide. Wide roads crisscrossed it. When entering the central area of Bamianshan, loud mountain songs rose and fell, and in the songs, men and women were busily accumulating fertilizer. People were enthusiastic and full of energy.

Floating Mountain City on the Top of White Clouds

Qingtian Street is a clean and beautiful street, lined with brand-new buildings. In the center of the street is a neat and flat road. People building new houses on the flat ground are humming such a folk song: "The street is built on Qingtianping, with glass windows and red lacquered doors. Loudspeakers are calling from the head and tail of the street, and every red heart faces Beijing." The singing is intertwined with the sounds of the motors of the sugar refinery, agricultural machinery processing plant, and sewing factory, awakening the Bamianshan that has been sleeping for ten thousand years. At the other end of the street, the supply and marketing cooperative is bustling with customers, and four salespersons are busy serving them. In the shop hanging with the sign "Traveler's Home," people are even busier. Since last year, the number of guests visiting Bamianshan has been increasing day by day, and now an inn with thirty beds has been built.

Party Secretary Comrade Cheng Liuxiang told the reporter that a long time ago, Bamianshan was a large forest of towering trees. Only when you walked here could you see a large patch of blue sky. From then on, people named this place Qingtianping (Blue Sky Flat). Due to the long-term destruction of the mountain by bandits, the trees were burned out. Not long ago, Qingtianping was still a barren hill covered with thorns, but today it has become a new type of city. This small city was built by the masses themselves. There are three other streets like Qingtian Street. Secretary Cheng paused thoughtfully and said, "By New Year's Day next year, there will be a power plant here, and ten thousand silver lights will illuminate the mountains and slopes. Cars will also climb up Bamianshan!"

In the suburbs of Qingtian Street, molten iron is flowing day and night in the earthen furnaces, and agricultural machinery plants are manufacturing machines. There is also a clean People's Hospital, an agricultural technical middle school with forty-three students, and a primary school with more than three hundred and twenty students. All school-age children on the mountain have been enrolled. Speaking of the culture of Bamianshan, there is also such a story. In the past, in order to let their children learn a few characters, the farmers here hired a private school teacher from Xikou, Sichuan Province. From then on, the first school was established on Bamianshan. Once, when farmer Chu Shufa held a celebration at home, he asked the teacher to write a "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parent, Teacher" shrine. However, the teacher wrote the "teacher" character of "teacher's seat" (师位) as the "feed" character for feeding pigs (喂). Chu Shufa, who was illiterate, hung this plaque on his family shrine. Now, the people of Bamianshan not only know how to read, but most can also write.

Young Women Vie to Climb the Mountain

"Don't marry a daughter to Bamianshan, climbing slopes and ditches makes the waist sore. Nine out of ten thatched houses are broken, and nine out of ten people are cold." "Bamianshan is not a suitable place, potatoes are the main food. If you want to eat a meal of rice, you have to wait until after the Mid-Autumn Festival in August." This is the description of the past living conditions of Bamianshan by the masses at the foot of the mountain. Indeed, the life of the people of Bamianshan in the past was unspeakably bitter, and even wild grass and kudzu roots were often not available. Party Secretary Peng Shitang's grandfather starved to death in a cave. When farmer Peng Basheng's family lived in a cave, two children were so hungry that they grabbed their parents' chests and cried to the point of death. This unbearable scene made the father unable to endure it any longer, and he finally jumped off a cliff and died. There is also such a folk song among the masses on the mountain: "Speaking of the bitter things on the mountain, sweat and blood become rivers, and tears fill the slopes. Bandits kill and set fires, and the mountain village becomes a den of tigers and wolves. The fields are barren and no one plants, and birds have nothing to eat and fly down the slope. Girls on the mountain marry down, and there are many single young men." After liberation, production developed, and the lives of the people have completely changed. Now 90% of the households have built new houses and put on new clothes and rubber shoes. The masses on the mountain have summarized that there are five "mores" in their lives: more young women, more tile-roofed houses, more rubber shoes, more skills at the sewing factory, and more pigs and sheep. In the past two years, last year and the year before, more than 100 women from the foot of the mountain married young men on the mountain, and there are currently more than 20 couples of young men and women in passionate love on the mountain and at the foot of the mountain. After visiting Bamianshan, while passing through the Liye Commune at the foot of the mountain, the reporter saw such a street poem: "Now Bamianshan is shining with red light, everyone wants to go to heaven. The buildings are tall and magnificent, and the grain is piled up like mountains. The blast furnaces are inserted into the clouds, and the molten iron flows like the Yangtze River. The cattle and sheep grow fat and strong, and the people's lives are full of joy."

National Policy Shines

The reason why Bamianshan has been able to transform from a barren wilderness into a new type of mountain city in just a few years, and the people's lives have been able to rapidly step onto the road of abundance from a state of hunger and cold, is mainly due to the meticulous care of the Party and the government and the close unity and mutual support of all ethnic groups. In the first year after liberation, the government gave them more than 5 million yuan in living expenses, as well as five head of cattle and a large number of agricultural implements. In 1952, the state provided them with more than 80,000 catties of grain for relief and supply. In 1954, the farmers on the mountain listened to the Party's words and embarked on the road of organization. At this time, the Party and the government vigorously led the masses to begin the reform of the farming system. In that year, grain basically achieved self-sufficiency, and with the support of the government, the lives of the masses began to improve. By 1957, agricultural production here had changed from extensive cultivation to intensive cultivation, from no fertilization to more than 500 dan of fertilizer per mu, and from sparse planting to dense planting. With the victory of this series of technical measures, grain output greatly increased, and the yield per mu increased from more than 100 catties to more than 300 catties. In that year, more than 270,000 catties of surplus grain were sold to the state. In 1958, even greater leaps forward were achieved in production, with a grain yield of more than 600 catties per mu, and a maximum yield of 1,230 catties per mu, a six-fold increase compared to the time of liberation. In that year, more than 370,000 catties of surplus grain were sold to the state.

While developing agricultural production, the Bamianshan Party Committee, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee and the characteristics of the mountain's vast pastures and abundant water and grass, vigorously developed animal husbandry production. In 1957, the number of pigs raised reached more than 6,000, with an average of 16 pigs per household. The income from raising pigs was more than 50 yuan per person. In 1958, the number of pigs raised per household increased to more than 26. In addition, there were 452 head of cattle, 183 goats, 50 sheep, 380 rabbits, and 4 mules and horses. The development of animal husbandry has not only increased the income of the commune members, but also greatly promoted agricultural production.

In order to comprehensively and better develop Bamianshan and build Bamianshan, the people of all ethnic groups in Bamianshan are continuing to work hard and move towards a more prosperous road. (Attached picture)

    荒山变乐园
    ——记湘西土家族苗族自治州龙山县八面山的新面貌
    本报记者　陈咏初
    记者怀着久已仰慕的心情，访问了湘西龙山县的八面山。吃过早饭，我们就开始攀登上山，时已晌午，才达到了八面山的腰部。这时，只见云层在我们的身旁轻轻游动，悬岩内所喷出的泉水，玉带似地向下飘流，围绕山脚的酉水面上，几只小船似树叶一样在飘荡。八面山的主峰，掩映在云层的深处，加以自然美景的衬托，显得更为巍峨雄壮了。下午三时，我们登上了山顶。这时，在我们眼前出现的是一个九十华里长、十五里路宽的一望无垠的原野。宽阔的道路纵横交错其中。进入八面山的中心地带时，嘹亮的山歌就此起彼伏，歌声中，男男女女的人们正在紧张积肥，人们热情洋溢，干劲冲天。
    白云顶上浮山城
    青天街是一条整洁而又美丽的街道，两旁排列着崭新的楼房，街中央，是一条整齐而又平坦的大马路。正在平地上建筑新房的人们哼着这样的一首歌谣：“大街修在青天坪，玻璃窗子红漆门，街头巷尾喇叭叫，颗颗红心向北京”。歌声与制糖厂、农具加工厂、缝纫厂内机器的马达声交织在一起，震醒了万年沉睡的八面山，街道的另一头，供销合作部内门庭若市，四个营业员在手脚不停地接应着顾客。在挂着“旅客之家”的店子内，人们更是忙碌。从去年以来，由于上八面山参观与访问的客人日益增多，现在修建了一个可容纳三十个床位的招待所。
    党委书记程流香同志告诉记者，很早以前，八面山是一大片参天的森林，只有走到这里时，才看见一大块青天，从此，人们就将这里命名为青天坪。由于山上长期遭受土匪的破坏，树木也被烧光了，青天坪在不久以前还是一片满布荆棘的荒丘，而今天却成了一座新型的城市。这个小城，都是群众自己动手盖起来的。像青天街这样的街道，还有三条。程书记若有所思地停顿了一下，说：“到明年元旦，这里就有发电厂，满山满坡就有万盏银灯了，汽车也会爬上八面山来！”
    在青天街的四郊，土炉内的铁水正在日夜奔流，农具农械厂正在制造机器。还有整洁的人民医院，有四十三名学员的农业技术中学、三百二十多个学生的小学，山上的适龄儿童都全部入了学。谈到八面山的文化，还有这样一个故事。以前，这里的农民，为着能让自己的儿女识几个字，曾从四川省的溪口请来了一位教私塾的先生，从此，八面山上开始办起了第一所学校。有一次农民储书发家里办喜事，去请先生写个“天地君亲师位”的神座，先生却把师位的“位”字，写成喂猪的“喂”字。储书发不识字，就把这个牌子挂在自己的家神上。现在，八面山的人不但识得字，而且大部分能写字了。
    青年妇女争上山
    “有女莫嫁八面山，上坡下墈腰干酸。十栋茅屋九栋破，十人之中九人寒。”“八面山上不是（场）合，洋芋子是对头，若想吃餐大米饭，要等八月过中秋”。这是山下的群众对八面山以往生活状况的描绘。的确，八面山的人们过去生活是苦不堪言，就是野草和葛根也经常吃不到口。党委书记彭世堂的祖父就活活饿死在山洞里。农民彭巴生全家住在洞里时，两个小孩饿得抓住大人的胸口，哭得死去活来。这种目不忍睹的情景，使得作父亲的再也无法忍受，终于纵身跳岩而死。山上的群众也有这样一首歌谣：“提起山上苦事多，血汗成河泪满坡，土匪杀人又放火，山寨成了虎狼窝。田地荒芜无人种，鸟雀无食飞下坡，山上有女往下嫁，青年男子单身多。”解放以后，生产发展了，人民的生活也完全变了样。现在90％的户盖起了新房子，穿上了新衣和胶鞋。山上的群众总结他们生活中有五多：青年妇女多、瓦房多、胶鞋多、缝纫厂的工夫多、猪羊多。去年和前年的两年中，山下就有一百多个妇女与山上的男青年结了婚，目前山上山下热恋着的青年男女，还有二十多对。记者在访问八面山以后，从山下的里耶公社经过时，看到了这样一首街头诗：“如今八面放红光，人人皆想上天堂，楼房修得高又大，粮食堆起似山岗，高炉插入云霄内，铁水奔流似长江，牛羊长得肥又壮，人民生活喜洋洋。”
    民族政策放光辉
    八面山之所以能在短短的几年内由一片荒山旷野而成为新型的山城，人民的生活能从饥寒交迫的境地而迅速踏上丰衣足食的道路，主要是党和政府无微不至的关怀和各民族的紧密团结与相互支持的结果。在解放后的第一年，政府给他们发了五千多（万）元的生活费，还有五头耕牛和大批农具。1952年，国家救济与供给他们的粮食达八万余斤。1954年，山上的农民听了党的话，走上了组织起来的道路。这时，党和政府又大力领导群众开始了耕作制度的改革。这一年的粮食就基本达到了自给，加上政府的支持，群众的生活就开始好转。到1957年，这里的农业生产由粗耕浅作变为了精耕细作，由不施肥到每亩施肥五百多担，由稀植变成了密植。这一系列技术措施的胜利，粮食产量就大大提高了，亩产量由一百多斤提高到了三百多斤，这一年就卖给了国家二十七万斤余粮。1958年的生产取得了更大的跃进，亩产粮食达到六百多斤，最高亩产达一千二百三十斤。比解放时翻了六番。这一年，卖给国家的余粮就有三十七万多斤。
    在发展农业生产的同时，八面山的党委还根据上级党委的指示和山上牧场广阔、水草丰盛的特点，大力发展了畜牧业生产。1957年生猪饲养数达到六千余头，每户平均养猪十六头。养猪的收入每人就有五十多元。1958年，每户养猪增至二十六头多。另外，还有耕牛四百五十二头，山羊一百八十三只，绵羊五十只，兔子三百八十只，骡马四头。畜牧业的发展不仅增加了社员的收入，而且大大促进了农业生产。
    为了全面地更好地开发八面山，建设八面山，八面山的各族人民正继续努力，向着更幸福的道路前进。（附图片）
