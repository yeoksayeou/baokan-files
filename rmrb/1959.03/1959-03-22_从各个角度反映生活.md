    Reflecting Life from All Angles
    The People’s Daily published on February 25th a photograph taken by Xinhua News Agency reporter Qi Guanshan, titled "Commune members of the Dongfeng People’s Commune in An’guo County are driving carts to transport fertilizer to the fields." The photograph displays to us: the boundless fields, the commune's land as flat as a lake, the field ridges neat and tidy, and a vast expanse of fertile land. The straight avenue points directly to the horizon. Carts carrying fertilizer are rolling along the avenue… After seeing it, one feels refreshed and happy, and it can evoke many beautiful associations, making you naturally think of the boundless vitality of the People's Commune. This is an excellent photographic work, which one is loath to put down.
    However, in recent news photographs, there are also many clichéd works. Some newspapers reported on the watering of wheat to promote greening, and many of the published photos were similar in content and form, with compositions basically the same as the aforementioned work by Comrade Qi Guanshan. Why does this phenomenon occur? I think it is probably related to whether the reporter has truly immersed themselves in life. Therefore, I hope that photographers can also truly immerse themselves in life and reflect all aspects of the country's leaping construction from various angles. The form should also be novel and diverse, and not be the same old thing.

    从各个角度反映生活
    人民日报2月25日刊登了新华社记者齐观山摄的一张“安国县东风人民公社的社员，正赶着大车往田间运送肥料”的照片。照片展示在我们面前的是：一望无际的田野，公社的土地平整得像湖面一样，田垅整洁，沃野千里。笔直的大道直挺挺地指向天际。一辆辆运肥大车，辚辚地行驶在大道上……看罢，心旷神怡，能勾起你许多优美的联想，使你很自然地想到人民公社的生命力无比强大。这是一幅优秀的摄影作品，令人爱不释手。
    但是，近来的新闻照片中也有不少千篇一律的作品。一些报刊报道小麦浇灌返青水，刊登的照片有好多在内容和形式上互相雷同，构图和齐观山同志的上述作品基本一样。为什么出现这种现象呢？我想恐怕与记者是否真正地深入了生活有关。因此，希望摄影工作者也能真正地深入到生活中去，从各个角度反映祖国飞跃建设的各个方面。形式也希望新颖多彩，不要千篇一律。
