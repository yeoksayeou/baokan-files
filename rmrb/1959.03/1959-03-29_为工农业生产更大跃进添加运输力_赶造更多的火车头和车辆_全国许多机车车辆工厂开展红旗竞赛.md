To add transport capacity for the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production,
Rush to manufacture more locomotives and vehicles
National locomotive and rolling stock factories launch Red Flag competition

This newspaper reports that more than twenty locomotive and rolling stock factories across the country are vigorously rushing to manufacture locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars to provide more transportation equipment for rapidly increasing railway transport capacity.

This year, China's railway transportation volume will increase significantly compared to last year. The planned new locomotives will increase by nearly two times compared to last year, freight cars will increase by more than three times, and passenger cars will also increase. By March 22nd, various factories had already manufactured sixty locomotives and more than one thousand six hundred freight cars.

Currently, a mass movement to build cars is widely unfolding in many factories. The broad masses of workers are actively proposing various suggestions and measures to improve operational methods, labor organization, and technology and equipment, thereby raising production levels. Workshop leaders, veteran workers, and technicians at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, after joint research, adopted a series of measures in terms of charge composition for cupola furnaces, converters, and cold-cast wheels, and successfully used local iron to cast high-quality wheels. This is of great significance for solving the current shortage of wheels. The Wuchang Rolling Stock Factory's task of manufacturing insulated cars and freight cars this year has increased by more than three times compared to last year. Since the factory launched the production campaign of "Great Leap Forward in Vehicle Production with Doubled Output," the output of various production processes has significantly increased.

Because the task of building cars is large, the time is pressing, and the supply of materials is relatively tight. The workers of many factories have adopted measures such as substitution, modification, and self-reliance to overcome difficulties. When manufacturing freight cars in February, the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory lacked brake beams for one hundred and fifty cars and nine hundred and sixty wheel discs. The workers collected unused waste steel rails from various places to replace shaped steel, making brake beams for one hundred and fifty cars. They also cleared out more than two thousand old wheel discs, reprocessed them, and made nine hundred and sixty wheel discs, ensuring that the newly built freight cars were delivered on time and with high quality, and also produced a batch of freight cars more than planned.

While vigorously rushing to manufacture locomotives and vehicles, the expansion and renovation projects of these twenty-odd factories are also being carried out at an accelerated pace.

On March 24th, the Ministry of Railways and the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union jointly held a telephone conference, calling on locomotive and rolling stock factories in various regions to further carry out the "Three Contributions" (contributing vehicles, materials, and technology) and "Five Comparisons" (comparing high output, high quality, high technology, high savings, and high collaboration) Red Flag competition movement centered on technological revolution, to create a new upsurge in the manufacture of locomotives and freight cars, and to organize inter-factory competitions among the locomotive and rolling stock factories. Representatives of various factories announced at the meeting their competition targets and measures for completing this year's locomotive and freight car manufacturing tasks, determined to overfulfill the state plan, and strive to participate in the National Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers Representative Conference in industry, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade to be held in Beijing in the fourth quarter of this year.

Changxindian

This newspaper reports that workers at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory are carrying out a heated "Work Efficiency Doubling Competition" to ensure the conversion of forty "Friendship" type gauge-changing locomotives before the end of March.

The rolling stock workshop, which is mainly responsible for the locomotive gauge-changing task, is like a battlefield, with cranes rumbling back and forth lifting huge wheels, and electric welding sparks flying everywhere. The labor competition here is no longer evaluated on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis, but rather within a shift to see who creates the highest record and who wins the upper hand. Liu Jiuping and Pei Dianren, veteran workers who rotate wheels on a lathe, recently used the method of "fast-tracking, large cuts" and processed a pair of wheels in one minute and five seconds, improving efficiency by two times compared to the past. They immediately told their competitors Yan Sihe and Chen Tie about their experience in detail, enabling Yan Sihe and Chen Tie to also create a higher record of processing a pair of wheels in forty-two minutes. Yan Sihe and Chen Tie then introduced all the advanced experience to the successor workers Xu Baofeng and Chi Jinzhong, and these two young men, with the ambition of "surpassing the predecessors," quickly caught up and innovated the record again with a score of processing a pair of wheels in forty minutes.

The locomotive workshop, which is responsible for dismantling and assembling locomotives, has also launched a competition. Their slogan is "When the locomotive arrives, start dismantling it, and ensure two locomotives are produced a day." All the workshops in the factory have transferred the most skilled workers and the best equipment to these two workshops. The freight car workshop not only supported the rolling stock workshop with more than twenty electric welding workers, but also took the initiative to help them complete the electric welding tasks for the vehicles.

The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has a heavy task this year. In this year, they will manufacture seventy locomotives, one thousand eight hundred freight cars, and two hundred and fifty-eight gauge-changing locomotives. In order to ensure the completion of the locomotive gauge-changing task, the factory's Party committee established an office, and Party committee members divided up the work to check the production situation of each workshop every day. The chief engineer and technicians walked out of the office, and they climbed on the locomotives and crawled under the locomotives for a while, personally commanding the operations on the spot.

Dalian

This newspaper reports that the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory is engaging in a mass movement and tapping production potential to increase the production of locomotives and freight cars at an unprecedented speed to support railway transportation.

The task recently assigned to the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory by the state is to manufacture four hundred locomotives and five thousand freight cars. In order to complete this arduous task, the workers have recently launched a large-scale Red Flag competition movement centered on high output and high quality. More than two hundred leading cadres throughout the factory have successively gone to the forefront of production, participating in production and leading production. Under the tense labor of all the workers in the factory, a new record of assembling ten locomotives in sixty hours was recently created.

While focusing on current production, this factory is continuing to prepare various conditions for a greater leap forward.

Qishuyan

This newspaper reports that the workers of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory are fully tapping their potential and fighting hard to produce more vehicles and deliver them earlier, arming the railway "pioneer."

In order to complete the first quarter's locomotive and vehicle production task, since mid-February, the factory has launched a "Nine Comparisons" competition craze, comparing ideology, output, quality, cost, variety, labor productivity, collaboration, safety, and measures. After the competition was launched, in the competition between second-level lathe worker Liu Hongfang and fifth-level lathe worker Huang Hongyuan, Huang Hongyuan completed twelve hours of work in five hours and twenty-five minutes. Liu Hongfang refused to fall behind. When machining the "blast furnace blockage," he improved the tool, reducing the processing time from more than one hour to twenty-five minutes, setting a new record for the factory.

The workers fully exerted their subjective initiative in the competition, increasing production and saving raw materials in all aspects to ensure normal production. The production of locomotives and vehicles requires a large number of steel castings. When steel was in short supply, the steelmaking workers of this factory carried out technological innovation, using local iron to produce high-quality steel and cast high-quality castings. This increased the output of steel castings in the first quarter by 12% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

In the case of insufficient, untimely, and incomplete supply of raw materials, the factory, according to this characteristic, actively organized sources of goods on the one hand, and on the other hand, queued up according to the urgency of the production tasks and flexibly allocated raw materials. In March, it was planned to produce one hundred and eighty freight cars. Due to the untimely supply of six-millimeter steel plates, only sixty-two cars were completed by the 16th. They prepared various parts in advance, and when the six-millimeter steel plates arrived, they concentrated on assembly. After adopting this method, from the 17th to the 21st, they completed the task of seventy-two freight cars in five days, ensuring the overfulfillment of the first quarter's freight car manufacturing task.

Zhuzhou

This newspaper reports that the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Hunan Province has taken effective measures to break through the raw materials barrier in every possible way and accelerate the manufacture of locomotives and vehicles. As of March 15, it had overfulfilled the first quarter's plan by 3.2%.

This year, the factory's task increased by 70% compared to last year. The biggest difficulty encountered at the beginning of the year was the shortage of raw materials. The factory's Party Committee mobilized the masses to break through the raw materials barrier. Within nine days, the factory put forward more than 32,000 rationalization proposals to solve raw materials and technological innovation, and 5,487 of them were adopted and implemented.

The Party Committee summarized these rationalization proposals as: produce (self-production), find (find raw materials inside and outside), substitute (use substitute materials on the premise of ensuring quality), save (save materials), and specialize (use special materials for special purposes). Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the workers of the whole factory immediately formed a climax of self-reliance and breaking through the raw materials barrier. The workers of the vehicle workshop took the lead, and after more than ten experiments, they made high-quality welding rods. More than two hundred workers in the raw materials workshop, everyone tried to come up with ideas and suggestions for making calcium carbide. The workers fought hard for three days and nights beside the furnace with a temperature of more than two thousand degrees, and finally refined calcium carbide. The frame of the eighty-ton electric locomotive, about 60% of which is made of angle iron, but there was no qualified angle iron at all. After collective research, the workers in the vehicle workshop pressed eight-millimeter iron plates into angle iron, solving the difficulty of insufficient materials. In this way, the factory completed the national total output value plan for the first quarter sixteen days ahead of schedule. (Attached picture)

    为工农业生产更大跃进添加运输力
    赶造更多的火车头和车辆
    全国许多机车车辆工厂开展红旗竞赛
    本报讯　全国各地二十多个机车、车辆工厂，正在大力赶造机车，货车和客车，为迅速增加铁路运输能力提供更多的运输设备。
    今年我国铁路运输量将比去年增加很多，计划新造的机车，将比去年增加近两倍，货车增加三倍多，客车也有所增加。各厂到3月22日止，已经制造了六十台机车，一千六百多辆货车。
    目前，一个群众性的造车竞赛运动，正在许多工厂里广泛展开。广大职工在改进操作方法、劳动组织和工艺、设备等方面，纷纷提出各种建议和措施，提高生产水平。戚墅堰机车车辆厂的车间领导干部和老工人、技术人员经过共同研究，在化铁炉、转炉和冷铸轮配料方面，采取了一系列措施，成功地用土铁铸造出了优质的车轮。这对解决当前车轮不足具有很大意义。武昌车辆厂今年制造保温车、货车的任务，比去年增加了三倍多，自从全厂开展了“出车高产大翻番”的生产运动以来，各个生产工序的产量都显著地提高了。
    因为造车的任务大，时间急迫，材料供应是比较紧张的。许多工厂的职工采取代用、改用、自力更生等措施，克服了困难。哈尔滨机车车辆工厂在2月份制造货车时，缺少一百五十辆车的制动梁和九百六十个车轮饼，工人们就到各处搜集不用的废钢轨代替型钢，制成了一百五十辆车的制动梁；他们还清查了二千多个旧轮饼，经过重新加工，制成了九百六十个车轮饼，保证了新造货车按时、按质出厂，而且还比计划多生产了一批货车。
    在大力赶制机车、车辆的同时，这二十多个工厂的扩建、改建工程，也正在加紧进行。
    3月24日，铁道部和中国铁路工会全国委员会联合召开了电话会议，号召各地机车车辆工厂把以技术革命为中心的三献（献车、献料、献技术）、五比（比高产、比优质、比技术、比节约、比协作）红旗竞赛运动进一步开展起来，掀起一个制造机车、货车的新高潮，并组织了各机车车辆工厂之间进行厂际竞赛。各厂的代表在会上宣布了自己为完成今年机车、货车制造任务的竞赛指标和措施，决心超额完成国家计划，争取参加今年第四季度在北京召开的全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
    长辛店
    本报讯　长辛店机车车辆工厂职工正在开展火热的“工效翻番竞赛”，保证在3月底以前改造好四十台“友好”型改轨机车。
    承担机车改轨主要任务的车辆车间像一个战场，吊车轰轰隆隆地来回吊着庞大的车轮，电焊火花四溅。这里的劳动竞赛已经不是按月、按周、按日评比了，而在一班里就要看谁创造的纪录高，看谁争得了上游。在一台机床上旋车轮的老工人刘久平和裴殿仁，前几天用“打快车，吃大刀”的办法，用一点零五分钟的时间就加工好了一对车轮，比过去效率提高了两倍。他俩立即把自己的经验详细地告诉给竞赛对手阎四合和陈铁，使阎四合和陈铁也创造了用四十二分钟加工一对车轮的更高纪录。阎四合和陈铁又把先进经验全介绍给接班工人许宝丰和迟进中，这两个小伙子又以“后来居上”的雄心猛起直追，以四十分钟加工一对车轮的成绩再次创新纪录。
    担负拆车和组装机车任务的机车车间也展开了竞赛，他们的口号是“机车什么时候到，什么时候动手拆车，保证一天出两台机车”。全厂各个车间都把技术最高的工人和最好的设备调给这两个车间用，货车车间不仅支援给车辆车间二十多个电焊工人，并且主动帮助他们完成车辆的电焊任务。
    长辛店机车车辆工厂今年任务很重，在这一年里他们要制造七十台机车，一千八百辆货车和二百五十八台改轨机车。工厂党委为了保证完成机车改轨任务，成立了办公室，党委委员分工包干每天检查各个车间的生产情况。总工程师和技术人员走出了办公室，他们一会儿登在机车上面，一会儿又爬到机车下边，亲临现场指挥作战。
    大连
    本报讯　大连机车车辆厂大搞群众运动，挖掘生产潜力，以空前的速度增产机车、货车，支援铁路运输。
    国家最近给大连机车车辆厂下达的任务是承制四百台机车，五千辆货车。职工们为了完成这个艰巨任务。最近掀起了一个声势浩大的以高产、优质为中心的红旗竞赛运动。全厂二百多领导干部，先后开上了生产第一线，参加生产领导生产。在全厂职工紧张的劳动下，最近创造了六十小时组装十台机车的新纪录。
    在大抓当前生产的同时，这个厂正继续为更大跃进准备各种条件。
    戚墅堰
    本报讯　戚墅堰机车车辆厂职工充分挖掘潜力，为多出车、早出车，武装铁路“先行官”而奋战。
    这个厂为了完成第一季度机车车辆生产任务，2月中旬以来，全厂掀起了比思想、比产量、比质量、比成本、比品种、比劳动生产率、比协作、比安全、比措施的“九比”竞赛热潮。竞赛开展以后，二级车工刘洪芳和五级车工黄洪元在对手竞赛中，黄洪元以五小时二十五分钟完成十二小时工作量，刘洪芳不甘落后，在车制“洗炉堵塞”时，改进刀具，加工时间由一个多小时缩短到二十五分钟，创全厂新纪录。
    职工们在竞赛中充分发挥了主观能动性，从各个方面增产节约原材料，保证生产正常进行。生产机车车辆需要大量钢铸件，当钢材不足时，这个厂的炼钢工人，开展技术革新，用土铁炼出优质钢，浇铸优质铸件。使第一季度钢铸件产量比去年第四季度增加12％。
    在原材料供应不足、不及时、不成套的情况下，工厂根据这个特点，一方面积极组织货源，一方面根据生产任务的轻重缓急进行排队，灵活调用原材料。3月份计划生产货车一百八十辆，由于六公厘钢板供应不及时，到16日只完成六十二辆。他们事先把各种零部件做好，等到六公厘钢板一到，就集中进行组装。采用这个办法后，17日到21日五天中，就完成了七十二辆货车的任务，保证了一季度货车制造任务超额完成。
    株洲
    本报讯　湖南株洲机车车辆工厂采取有效措施，千方百计大破原材料关，加快机车车辆的制造。到3月15日止，超额3.2％完成第一季度计划。
    这个厂今年的任务比去年增加70％。年初遇到最大的困难，是原材料不足。工厂党委会就发动群众，大破原材料关，在九天内，全厂提出了解决原材料和技术革新的合理化建议三万二千多件，被采纳实现的有五千四百八十七件。
    党委会将这些合理化建议，归纳起来是：产（自己生产）、找（内外找原材料）、代（在保证质量的前提下用代用材料）、省（节约用材）、专（专材专用）。全厂职工在党委会的领导下，马上形成了一个自力更生，大破原材料关的高潮，车辆车间的工人首先行动起来，经过十多次试验，制成了质量优良的电焊条，原材料车间的二百多个工人，人人为试制电石想办法、出主意，工人们在二千多度高温的炉旁，经过三昼夜苦战，终于炼出了电石。八十吨电机车的骨架，60％左右是由角铁制成的，而合格的角铁一点也没有，车辆车间的工人经过集体研究后，用八公厘的铁板压制成了角铁，解决了材料不足的困难。这样，全厂第一季度国家总产值计划就提前十六天完成了。（附图片）
