    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 13th: The Director of Propaganda and National Guidance of Iraq today issued a statement to the people of Syria, Iraq, and the Arab nations. The statement demands that the UAR authorities cease all activities against the Republic of Iraq from this point forward.

    The statement, published in today's newspapers here, was issued in response to the UAR authorities in Syria holding a funeral for Shihab, a traitor to Iraq. Shihab fled to Syria after being wounded in the Shawwaf rebellion and subsequently died.

    The statement said that Shihab was a lackey of imperialism who conspired with the great traitor Shawwaf to undermine the security of the Iraqi people and betray the motherland.

    The statement accuses the UAR authorities of holding a memorial service in Damascus for this traitor, who betrayed the Arab nation and the Iraqi people, and burying him in the Mausoleum of Saladin. The statement said that there is no doubt that Arab citizens in Syria, Egypt, and throughout the Arab world will condemn this practice.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 13th: Workers, staff, and students in Baghdad have returned to their normal work and studies yesterday after participating in three days of demonstrations to support the Iraqi government and leader Qasim in suppressing the treasonous conspiracy.

    Brigadier General Ahmed Saleh al-Abdi, the military governor, issued a statement yesterday expressing "deep gratitude and respect to the compatriots who maintained order during the events in Mosul." The statement also said: "At the same time, we ask them to return home and carry out their work, so that the responsible government authorities can maintain order and security. We call on all of them to work in close unity and safeguard the peace of our beloved Republic under the leadership of our leader Qasim."

    伊拉克宣传和国家指导处长发表声明
    要求阿联停止反伊拉克活动
    新华社巴格达13日电　伊拉克宣传和国家指导处长今天向叙利亚、伊拉克和阿拉伯国家人民发出了一项声明。声明要求阿联当局从现在起不再进行反对伊拉克共和国的活动。
    今天这里的各家报纸所刊载的这项声明，是因为叙利亚阿联当局为伊拉克的卖国贼希哈卜举行葬礼而发表的。希哈卜是在沙瓦夫叛国事件中负伤逃到叙利亚后死去的。
    声明说，希哈卜是帝国主义的走狗，他和大卖国贼沙瓦夫一道进行阴谋活动来破坏伊拉克人民的安全，背叛了祖国。
    声明指责阿联当局将在大马士革为这个背叛阿拉伯民族和伊拉克人民的卖国贼举行追悼，并把他安葬在萨拉赫丁陵墓。声明说，毫无疑问，叙利亚、埃及和阿拉伯世界各地的阿拉伯公民将指责这种手法。
    新华社巴格达13日电　巴格达的工人、职员、学生在参加了三天的示威游行来支持伊拉克政府和领袖卡塞姆镇压叛国阴谋犯以后，昨天已经恢复了正常的工作与学习。
    军事长官艾哈迈德·萨勒·阿卜迪准将昨天发表声明，表示“深深感谢和尊敬在摩苏尔发生事变的时候维持了秩序的同胞”。声明还说：“同时，我们要求他们回家去并进行工作，以便让负责的政府当局维持秩序和安全。我们号召他们全体在紧密的团结中工作，并且维护在我们的领袖卡塞姆领导下的可爱的共和国的安宁。”
