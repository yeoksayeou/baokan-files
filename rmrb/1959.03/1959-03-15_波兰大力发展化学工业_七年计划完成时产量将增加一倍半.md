    Warsaw Dispatch, March 14th, by our correspondent Li Ke: Polish Deputy Minister of the Chemical Industry, Taben, received our reporter and gave a detailed account of the rapidly developing chemical industry in Poland.

    Unique Advantages in Raw Materials
    Comrade Taben said: Poland has all the conditions for developing the chemical industry. Poland is one of the world's largest coal producers, with an annual output of nearly 100 million tons. Tar production is advanced in Europe. Poland also has abundant salt mines, with an annual output of 1.6 million tons, which is the raw material for the production of soda and chlorine. Poland also has the world's largest sulfur deposits, with proven reserves of 111 million tons. Recently, the geological survey team discovered natural gas, which means we have found the cheapest raw material for the production of plastics and nitrogen fertilizers. Existing discoveries allow us to extract 10 billion cubic meters annually. In addition, our country has countless other chemical raw materials.

    Leading Development Speed
    Although Poland has such good conditions for developing the chemical industry, the pre-war bourgeois regime did not make good use of them. Poland's existing chemical industry was entirely established after the people's regime. The current output of Poland's chemical industry is nine times that of pre-war levels. In fourteen years, 150 large chemical plants have been built, including the Auschwitz Chemical Combine, the Kędzierzyn Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, and the Wizów Sulfuric Acid Plant, which are among the largest in the world. Chemical sectors that did not exist in pre-war Poland, such as pharmaceuticals, plastics, and synthetic fibers, have been established. We now trial-produce hundreds of new chemical products every year; last year alone, we successfully trial-produced 400 kinds.

    Comrade Taben said: Despite the significant progress made by the chemical industry during the people's regime, it still lags behind due to the vigorous development of other industrial sectors. Therefore, the Polish United Workers' Party, in its directives for the future seven-year national economic development, stipulates that by 1965, the output of Poland's chemical industry should be two and a half times its current level, and its development speed should be leading among all sectors, as the entire national economy will only grow by 80% during the same period.

    Four Pioneers
    Poland will first develop synthetic fibers, mainly nylon. By 1965, the output of synthetic fibers will reach 118,000 tons, an increase of fourteen times. In the near future, we will build two nylon factories with an annual output of 5,000 to 7,000 tons.

    The development of the synthetic fiber industry is of particular significance to Poland because Poland is a country lacking cotton and wool. The development of the synthetic fiber industry can reduce cotton and wool imports, and Poland's abundant coal, coke, and natural gas can provide the cheapest raw materials for the development of synthetic fibers.

    Secondly, plastics must be developed. In the modern world, industry cannot do without plastics. In 1958, Poland produced 25,000 tons of plastics; in seven years, it will produce 180,000 tons. At that time, the average per capita consumption of plastics in Poland will increase from the current 0.9 kilograms to 6 kilograms. In addition to industrial use, the market will have a wide variety of colorful plastic daily necessities.

    Thirdly, the needs of agriculture for chemical fertilizers must be met, as well as the needs of farmers for pesticides to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. By 1965, nitrogen fertilizer will increase from the current annual output of 230,000 tons to 480,000 tons, and phosphate fertilizer will increase from 150,000 tons in 1958 to 360,000 tons. At that time, the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare can be increased from the current 30 kilograms to 88 kilograms, which can greatly increase the yield of agricultural products.

    Fourthly, the pharmaceutical industry, including antibiotics, penicillin, vitamins, etc., must be developed.

    Tasks Will Be Overfulfilled
    Comrade Taben said: You may ask, what methods will we use to increase chemical production by half again in seven years? Our methods are: First, increase investment. On average, each Pole will invest 500 złoty in the chemical industry each year. We will expand all the old factories and build 22 new chemical plants. We have good neighbors, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia, who will help us. One of the historically significant events for the Polish chemical industry in the next seven years is the construction of an oil processing chemical plant, which will use the gas from oil processing to produce synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, etc. This enterprise is a large-scale factory like Nowa Huta. Poland does not produce oil, so why build an oil processing plant? Because the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of socialist countries has decided that by 1963, an oil pipeline will be laid from the Ural region of the Soviet Union, through Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia to Hungary. Tens of millions of tons of oil will flow through this oil pipeline every year. This will be a political event of world significance, which will satisfy the needs of European socialist countries for oil at one stroke. At that time, Poland will also have oil.

    We also plan to completely eliminate manual labor in the chemical industry and achieve complete mechanization and automation in the next seven years.

    The most important aspect is to mobilize all workers and technicians to tap production potential and find usable production resources. Now all factories have discussed the task put forward by the Party. The discussion shows that everyone is not only confident in completing the task but also prepared to overfulfill it. We have decided that by 1965, chemical production will increase by 1.6 times compared to the present, which is 10% higher than the task put forward by the Party. In order to celebrate the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, the people of the whole country are in high spirits, and they complete their production tasks ahead of schedule every month. The chemical industry department is expected to produce 530 million złoty more products than the national plan this year. (Attached picture)

### 波兰大力发展化学工业  七年计划完成时产量将增加一倍半

    波兰大力发展化学工业
    七年计划完成时产量将增加一倍半
    本报华沙14日电　记者李克报道：波兰化学工业部副部长塔班接见了本报记者，并向记者详细地介绍了波兰迅速发展的化学工业的情况。
    原料得天独厚
    塔班同志说：波兰具有发展化学工业的一切条件。波兰是世界上产煤最多的国家之一，每年产煤将近一亿吨，焦油的生产在欧洲占着先进地位，波兰还有丰富的盐矿，每年的产量达一百六十万吨，这是生产苏打和氯的原材料，波兰也是世界上硫磺最多的国家，现已查明的储量达一亿一千一百万吨，不久前，地质勘察队又发现了天然瓦斯，这就是说，我们找到了生产塑料、氮肥最便宜的原料，现有的发现就使我们可以每年开采十亿立方公尺。此外，我国还有其它数不清的化学原料。
    发展速度领先
    尽管波兰有这么好的发展化学工业的条件，可是战前资产阶级政权却没有很好的利用。波兰现有的化学工业完全是战后人民政权时期建立起来的。现在波兰化学工业的产量相当于战前的九倍，在十四年内，建立了一百五十个大化学厂，其中有奥斯维辛化学联合厂、肯杰仁化肥厂、维佐夫硫酸厂这类在世界上有数的大工厂，建立了战前波兰根本没有的化学部门，像制药、塑料、合成纤维等。现在我们每年都试制成成百种的新的化学产品，仅去年一年试制成功的就有四百种。
    塔班同志说：尽管化学工业在人民政权时期有了长足的进步，但是由于其它工业部门的蓬勃发展，化学工业仍然显得落后。所以波兰统一工人党在今后七年国民经济发展的指示中规定，到1965年，波兰化学工业产量要相当于现在的两倍半，它的发展速度要在各个部门之中领先，因为整个国民经济在同一时期只增长80％。
    四个开路先锋
    波兰首先要发展合成纤维，其中主要是尼龙。到1965年，合成纤维的产量要达到十一万八千吨，比现在增长十四倍。在最近期间，我们要兴建两座年产五千吨到七千吨的尼龙工厂。
    发展合成纤维工业对波兰有特殊的巨大意义，因为波兰是个缺乏棉花和羊毛的国家，合成纤维工业的发展可以减少棉毛的进口，而波兰丰饶的煤、焦炭、天然瓦斯可以为合成纤维的发展提供最便宜的原料。
    其次要发展塑料，在现代世界，工业是离不开塑料的。1958年波兰生产了二万五千吨塑料，七年后要生产十八万吨，那时，按人口平均波兰将从现在的每人零点九公斤提高到每人六公斤塑料。除了工业用而外，市场上将出现花色品种丰富多采的塑料制日用品。
    第三，要满足农业对化学肥料的需要，满足农民对防治病虫害药剂的需求，到1965年氮肥将从现在年产二十三万吨提高到四十八万吨，磷肥从1958年的十五万吨提高到三十六万吨。那时，每公顷的施肥量可以从现在的三十公斤增加到八十八公斤，可以使农产品的产量大大提高。
    第四，要发展制药工业，包括抗生素、盘尼西林、维他命等等。任务将超额完成
    塔班同志说：你们也许要问，我们用什么办法在七年期间把化学生产提高一倍半呢？我们的办法是：第一，增加投资，平均每个波兰人每年要向化学工业投资五百兹罗提，我们要扩大所有的旧厂，另建二十二个新的化学工厂。我们有好邻居，苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克都要帮助我们。未来七年内，波兰化学工业具有历史性意义的事件之一，是要建设一座石油加工化学厂，利用石油加工时的瓦斯来生产人造纤维、人造橡胶等，这个企业是像诺瓦胡塔这种规模的大型工厂。波兰不产石油，为什么还要建石油加工厂？因为社会主义国家经济互助委员会已经决定，在1963年前，要敷设一条从苏联乌拉尔区开始的，经波兰、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克到匈牙利的输油管，每年要有上千万吨的石油流过这个石油管，这将是一个有世界意义的政治事件，它一举而满足欧洲社会主义国家对石油的需求，那时候，波兰也就有了石油。
    我们还打算在未来的七年间，在化学工业内完全取消手工劳动，实现完全的机械化和自动化。
    最重要的一个方面，是发动全体工人、技术人员挖掘生产潜力，寻找可以利用的生产资源。现在所有的工厂都对党提出来的这个任务进行了讨论，讨论的结果表明，大家不仅有信心完成任务，还准备超额完成，我们决定：到1965年化学生产要比现在增加一点六倍，即比党提出来的任务高10％。为了庆祝波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的召开，全国人民政治情绪高涨，每月都提前完成生产任务，化学工业部门今年可望比国家计划多生产五亿三千万兹罗提的产品。（附图片）
