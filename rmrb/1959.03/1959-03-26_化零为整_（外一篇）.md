    “Turning Fragments into Wholes” (and Another Piece)
    Gan Feng
    Not long ago, at an exhibition, I saw a child's garment sewn together from scraps of colorful fabric. It was not only economical but also beautiful, making one admire the maker's spirit of thrift and marvel at the seamstress's diligence and skill. Matters are not about size; as long as they embody a good spirit, they will always move and inspire people. I believe this spirit and method of "turning fragments into wholes" can also be applied to work, study, and other aspects of life.
    Now, when we talk about reading, some comrades complain that they don't have time, because they are always in meetings or have this and that to do. Yes, it is indeed busy, as we are in the great leap forward, how can we not be busy? It is indeed rare for everyone to take out whole blocks of time to read leisurely. But fragmented time is not lacking, and there is plenty of it, offering a great "battlefield for heroes." Let's do some simple calculations. Apart from the prescribed study system, we should be able to read five pages of books every day using fragmented time, right? If we persist, we will read one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five pages a year, and nine thousand one hundred and twenty-five pages in five years, which is more than the three volumes of Das Kapital, a set of Selected Works of Marx and Engels (two volumes), a set of Selected Works of Lenin (two volumes), three volumes of Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and a set of Selected Works of Lu Xun. With this calculation, our confidence and drive will come, and instead of complaining about not having time, we will effectively use the many fragments of time.
    Is there a theoretical basis for the method of turning fragments into wholes? Of course, there is. In philosophy, it is the transformation from quantitative change to qualitative change, and in economics, it is the way of thrift. Some fragmented and scattered things may seem insignificant, but when they are concentrated, they undergo a qualitative change and become a great force.
    Whether in terms of time, economy, or materials, on the one hand, we must be good at using the "whole" and giving full play to its role; on the other hand, we must also be good at using fragments, turning fragments into wholes, and tapping into all kinds of potential.

    “化零为整”（外一篇）
    敢峰
    不久以前，我在一个展览会上，看到过一种小孩服装，是用各色的零碎花布拼起来缝成的，既经济，又好看，不仅使人钦佩制作者的节俭精神，而且叹羡缝工的勤和巧。事情不在大小，只要体现出一种好的精神来，它总会使人受到感动和启发。这种“化零为整”的精神和方法，我觉得在工作上、学习上以及生活的其他方面，也都用得着。
    现在一谈读书，有些同志就叫嚷没有时间，不是开会啦就是要有这样那样的事儿。是的，说忙的确也忙，我们正处在大跃进的洪流中，哪能不忙？每个人要拿出一整块一整块的时间安安闲闲地来读书，的确不可多得。但零碎时间却不是没有的，而且还多得很，还大有“英雄用武之地”。我们不妨来算几笔细帐。除了规定的学习制度以外，每天我们利用零碎时间读五页书总该是办得到的吧，如果坚持下去的话，那一年就要读一千八百二十五页书，五年就要读九千一百二十五页书，其数量就要比三卷资本论、一套马恩文选（两卷集）、一套列宁文选（两卷集）、三本毛泽东选集和一套鲁迅选集还多一些。这样一算帐，我们的信心和干劲就来了，不是吵嚷没有时间，而是把许多零碎的时间有效地利用起来。
    化零为整的办法有没有理论根据？当然有的。在哲学上就是由量变到质变，在经济上就是节约之道。一些零碎的、分散的东西，看来是不起什么作用的，但一集中起来，就起了质的变化，成为巨大的力量。
    无论在时间上、经济上和物资上，我们一方面要善于利用“整”的，充分发挥它的作用；另一方面也要善于利用零碎的，化零为整，把各种潜力都挖出来。
