    Combining Production and Seizing Harm Elimination and Disease Prevention
    Experience Exchange Conference on Preventing Five Major Parasitic Diseases Proposes Combat Tasks

    (Our reporter Hu Jian, Li Guohua reported) The National Experience Exchange Conference on Preventing Five Major Parasitic Diseases, which recently concluded in Changsha City, demanded that all possible areas nationwide basically eliminate schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, and hookworm disease before National Day this year (kala-azar has already been basically eliminated in over 90% of the epidemic areas nationwide), and basically eliminate the four major pests: mosquitoes, flies, sparrows, and rats. At this conference, after extensive exchange of harm elimination and disease prevention experiences and thorough discussions, the representatives, full of enthusiasm and confidence, strived to achieve this combat task.

    This conference was convened by the Ministry of Health in Changsha City, lasting eleven days from February 26th to March 8th. Over two hundred representatives participated in the meeting, which was a "three-way combination" of leading cadres from health departments, scientists, and practitioners of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. At the meeting, the experiences of various regions across the country in preventing five major parasitic diseases last year were systematically and comprehensively summarized and exchanged. Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian and other provinces respectively introduced their successful experiences in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, malaria, hookworm, and filariasis. The representatives also visited the mass harm elimination and disease prevention combat scenes in the rural areas of Changde, Yiyang, Yuanjiang, Lingling, Xiangyin, Chenxian and other counties in Hunan Province. Based on a comprehensive summary of mass harm elimination and disease prevention experiences, the conference preliminarily formulated a concrete plan for eliminating five major parasitic diseases in 1959, and proposed specific measures and requirements such as investigation and research, treating patients, eliminating transmission vectors, and strengthening mass prevention work, in order to further combine with industrial and agricultural production, organize and unite all forces, and continue to carry out the mass harm elimination and disease prevention movement extensively and in depth. The conference requested that all regions, when carrying out the work of eliminating five major parasitic diseases, must focus on current production; must closely cooperate with doing a good job in the current collective health undertakings of the people's communes, with eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating other epidemic diseases; Regions and provinces and counties should implement the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" in eliminating harm and preventing diseases, strengthen joint prevention, carry out socialist large-scale cooperation, pool the wisdom of the masses, and strive to completely eliminate the five major parasitic diseases and other diseases.

    The conference believed that with the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the national health work achieved great results last year. Schistosomiasis, which was prevalent in twelve provinces and cities, has been basically eliminated in 60% of the areas. More than 3.17 million schistosomiasis patients were treated last year, which is approximately three times the total number of patients treated in the eight years from 1949 to 1957; the area of snails eliminated last year in conjunction with production is approximately twice the total area of snail elimination in the past eight years. Kala-azar has been basically eliminated in over 90% of the epidemic areas. More than 2.44 million patients with filariasis were treated last year alone, which is sixteen times the total number of people treated in the eight years from 1949 to 1957. More than 30 million hookworm patients were treated last year, which is five times the total number of treatments in the eight years since liberation. Vigorous efforts were made to prevent and control malaria last year, and the incidence of malaria in various regions has decreased significantly. For example, in Guizhou Province, a well-known malaria-prone area, the incidence of malaria decreased from 0.59% in 1957 to 0.33% last year; Chenxian Prefecture, a malaria-prone area in Hunan Province, has ended the situation of "people getting malaria when they arrive in Chenzhou."

    The achievement of these results is a great victory of putting politics in command and combining science and technology with the mass movement. In the fight to eliminate harm and prevent diseases, under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, various regions have handed over technology to the masses, concentrated the wisdom and strength of the masses, and launched large-scale mass movements, which is a path to eliminate harm and prevent diseases quickly, well, and economically. From the experience exchanged at the conference, it can be seen that in areas where health cadres deeply mobilized the masses, taught prevention and treatment knowledge to the masses, and adopted the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and the combination of local and foreign methods, the prevention and treatment work was carried out quickly and well. The Liu Jintao treatment team in Hunan Province proposed 20 technical innovations in the treatment of schistosomiasis, which increased treatment efficiency by nearly 200 times. Recently, in Changde County of this province, the masses contributed the traditional Chinese medicine "Guanzhong Decoction" in the treatment of hookworm disease. Five million hookworm patients in the province took "Guanzhong Decoction" for treatment, and the curative effect reached about 85%, which solved the difficulty of insufficient "tetrachloroethylene" medicine for treating hookworm disease. Shanghai used "industrial waste" calcium carbide slag to eliminate snails, and various regions used dozens of wild plants such as mountain mahogany leaves, bitter kudzu, and crown of thorns to eliminate snails and mosquitoes and flies, and the effects were very good.

    The conference believes that eliminating five major parasitic diseases is an arduous and complex struggle to conquer nature and transform the national health environment. The prevalence of parasitic diseases is due to the transmission of mosquitoes, snails, etc. Diseases and pests are interrelated. Therefore, eliminating diseases must eliminate harm, and comprehensive measures must be taken. Comprehensive measures may vary from place to place, from time to time, and from place to place, and it is possible to concentrate the main forces to eliminate the source of infection at a certain period, or to take comprehensive measures mainly to eliminate the route of transmission (such as mosquitoes) at a certain period. The conference emphasized: With the development of the harm elimination and disease prevention movement, the closer to the end, the more scattered and difficult to find the remaining patients and vectors of transmission, and the more arduous the task. Therefore, the work of eliminating harm and preventing diseases should be done more and more carefully, and there should be no slightest complacency. Areas that have basically eliminated a certain parasitic disease should also conduct thorough and repeated sweeps; even areas that have been thoroughly eliminated after inspection should establish some necessary prevention systems, observe for a long time, prevent resurgence, and strive to eradicate the five major parasitic diseases.

    结合生产抓紧除害灭病
    防治五大寄生虫病经验交流会提出战斗任务
    本报讯　记者胡坚、李国华报道：最近在长沙市闭幕的全国防治五大寄生虫病经验交流会议要求全国一切可能的地方，在今年国庆节前基本消灭血吸虫病、疟疾、丝虫病和钩虫病等五大寄生虫病（黑热病已经在全国90％以上的流行地区基本消灭），和基本消灭蚊、蝇、雀、鼠等四大害。这次会议上经过广泛交流除害灭病经验和充分讨论，代表们干劲百倍、满怀信心地力争实现这一战斗任务。
    这次会议是由卫生部在长沙市召开的，从2月26日至3月8日，历时十一天。参加会议的有二百多名代表，是一次卫生部门领导干部、科学家和中西医务工作者“三结合”的会议。会上，比较系统地全面地总结和交流了去年全国各地防治五大寄生虫病的经验。湖南、云南、贵州、四川、福建等省分别介绍了防治血吸虫病、疟疾、钩虫和丝虫病等方面的成功经验；代表们还在湖南省常德、益阳、沅江、零陵、湘阴、郴县等县农村参观了群众性除害灭病的战斗场面。会议在全面总结群众除害灭病经验的基础上，初步制订了1959年消灭五大寄生虫病的具体方案，提出了调查研究、治疗病人、消灭传播媒介和加强群众性预防工作等具体措施和要求，以便进一步结合工农业生产，组织和团结一切力量，继续深入广泛地开展群众性除害灭病运动。会议要求各地在开展消灭五大寄生虫病工作时，必须围绕当前生产进行；必须同搞好当前人民公社集体卫生事业、同除四害、讲卫生和消灭其他流行性的疾病的工作，紧密配合起来；各地区之间、各省各县之间，要贯彻除害灭病“全国一盘棋”的思想，加强联防，开展社会主义大协作，群策群力，为彻底消灭五大寄生虫病和其他疾病而斗争。
    会议认为，随着工农业大跃进，去年全国卫生工作成绩很大。流行在十二省市的血吸虫病，已在60％的地区基本消灭了。去年一年治疗了三百一十七万多名血吸虫病人，约等于1949年到1957年八年中治疗病人总数的三倍；去年一年结合生产消灭的钉螺面积，约等于过去八年灭螺总面积的两倍。黑热病已在90％以上的流行地区基本消灭了。丝虫病去年一年就治疗了二百四十四万多名病人，等于1949年到1957年八年中治疗总人数的十六倍。去年一年治疗了三千多万钩虫病人，比解放以来八年的治疗总人数增加五倍。去年大力开展了防治疟疾工作，各地疟疾发病率都显著下降了。例如，有名的高疟区贵州省，去年疟疾发病率由1957年的0.59％下降到0.33％；湖南省高疟区郴县专区已结束了“人到郴州打摆子”的局面。
    这些成绩的取得，是政治挂帅，科学技术和群众运动相结合的伟大胜利。在除害灭病的斗争中，在各级党委的统一领导下，各地把技术交给群众，集中群众的智慧和力量，大搞群众运动，是一条多快好省地除害灭病的道路。从会上交流经验来看，凡是卫生干部深入发动群众，把防治知识教给群众，采用中西合作、土洋并举的地区，防治工作就开展得又快又好。湖南省刘锦桃治疗小组在治疗血吸虫病中，提出技术革新二十条，使治疗工效提高近二百倍。这个省的常德县最近在治疗钩虫病中，群众献出了中药“贯仲汤”土方，全省服用“贯仲汤”治疗五百万名钩虫病人，疗效达到85％左右，解决了治钩虫病“四氯乙烯”药剂不足的困难。上海市用电石渣“工业废品”灭钉螺，以及各地用山红木叶、苦葛、霸王鞭等几十种野生植物消灭钉螺和蚊蝇，效果都很好。
    会议认为，消灭五大寄生虫病，是一场征服自然、改造国家卫生环境的艰巨、复杂的斗争。寄生虫病的流行是由于蚊子、钉螺等的传播，疾病与害虫是互相关联的。因此灭病必须除害，必须采取综合措施。综合措施各地可以因病、因时、因地有所不同，既可以在一定时期集中主要力量消灭传染的病源，也可以在某个时期采取以消灭传染途径（如蚊子之类）为主的综合措施。会议强调指出：随着除害灭病运动的发展，愈到尾期，剩下的病人和传染媒介愈加分散和不易发现，任务更加艰巨。因此除害灭病工作应该越做越细致，不能有丝毫麻痹大意的情绪。目前已基本消灭某种寄生虫病的地区，还要深入地反复扫荡；就是经过检查已彻底消灭某种病害的地区，也应建立一些必要的预防制度，长期观察，防止死灰复燃，力争根除五大寄生虫病。
