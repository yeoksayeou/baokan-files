This newspaper, Chengdu, 10th – Rural areas throughout Sichuan Province are transferring their main forces to the front lines of spring plowing production.

Currently, in all regions, from the county and commune levels down to the production teams, the labor force used in the field management of summer-harvest crops and on the spring plowing production front generally accounts for 60% to 70% or more of the total labor force. The remaining labor force is also rationally arranged based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the time, focusing on current agricultural activities.

In order to ensure an even greater leap forward in agricultural production, people's communes in various places are transferring labor from other areas to strengthen the agricultural production front. Yilong County, based on the needs of the local production season, rectified the county-run industries by various means; for example, merging factories of similar nature and reducing non-production organizations, using semi-labor in exchange for main labor and other methods, drawing out more than 13,000 main laborers, strengthening the agricultural production force. Communes also made appropriate adjustments to the forces invested in sideline management without affecting normal income. In sideline production, the general principle of "no large-scale engagement when busy, small-scale engagement when slightly busy, and large-scale engagement when not busy" is adopted, flexibly controlling and using manpower.

Various Red and Expert Schools, agricultural middle schools, and other training classes run by the communes have also changed their original tendency of not being closely integrated with current production, and have fully exploited the labor potential of the students. In the past, most of the people's communes in Nanchong County ran agricultural middle schools and Red and Expert Schools, and these members managed very little area of spring-harvest crops during their studies, and their labor potential was not fully exploited. Now, some Red and Expert Schools have changed from long-term to short-term; agricultural middle schools all implement half-work and half-study, and the commune劃劃out production areas to be responsible for production by these school members. The Spark Commune also mobilized more than 200 members with strong labor and production skills to temporarily return to the team to participate in production, and then make up lessons during slack farming seasons.

From the "five members" of logistics work and other non-production personnel, communes in various places also adopt the method of exchanging the strong and the weak, reforming tools, and changing working methods to transfer them to participate in agricultural production. In the collective canteens of communes in northern Sichuan and eastern Sichuan, many are set up with some dedicated personnel to peel sweet potato skins, pick firewood, and collect pigweed, etc. Now, some of the work is distributed to the members, using their rest time outside of work to do it incidentally, saving a large number of laborers to participate in agricultural production. The Hongguang Commune in Pi County also cultivates everyone to be multi-skilled, organizes various professional teams, and tries to replace men with women and the strong with the weak, saving a large number of strong male members to strengthen the agricultural front.

This newspaper, Changsha, 10th – Anhua County, Hunan Province, has adopted five measures of "sorting, digging, pressing, changing, and managing" to tap the labor potential of various aspects, increasing the number of agricultural work attendance from the original 220,000 to more than 270,000, ensuring the needs of the main attack front, and rationally arranging the labor force of other lines to ensure the simultaneous completion of other production tasks.

At the expanded cadre meeting of the whole county held in early February, the Anhua County Party Committee made an accounting and investigation of the labor force, and found that the labor force was not properly arranged, many departments and units had accumulated and wasted labor, the labor management of many communes had not kept up, and labor efficiency had not been fully exploited; tool reform was also not grasped forcefully enough, and work efficiency was not high. After discussion, it was decided to adopt five measures of "sorting, digging, pressing, changing, and managing." The so-called "sorting" is based on the principle of agricultural production as the center and overall leap forward, while also taking into account the complex nature of production content, and made appropriate arrangements for the labor ratio required for grain production, cash crops, animal husbandry and aquaculture, industry and transportation, and service industries. "Digging" is that there are too many service personnel around production (such as canteen personnel), and more than 9,900 people can be "dug" out from canteens throughout the county to participate in agricultural production. "Pressing" is that the county compressed 25 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects with large scale, difficult tasks, and small losses after shrinking, drew out labor in a timely manner to turn to preparations for plowing, and reduced water conservancy labor by more than 800,000 man-days. "Changing" is to vigorously grasp tool reform to save manpower. "Managing" is to improve labor management on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, and the county has widely promoted the production responsibility system, making the production order well-organized and greatly enhancing the enthusiasm for labor.

Since Anhua County adopted these five measures, it has greatly promoted spring plowing production. The daily amount of fertilizer accumulation has increased three times compared to before. More than 62,000 mu of seedling fields have been generally sorted. Tea, forest, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline industries also have dedicated personnel to manage and have been developed accordingly.

### 该增就增　该减就减　全面安排　保证重点  四川抽调人力加强春耕战线  湖南安化县采取“排、挖、压、改、管”五项措施挖掘劳动潜力

    该增就增　该减就减　全面安排　保证重点
    四川抽调人力加强春耕战线
    湖南安化县采取“排、挖、压、改、管”五项措施挖掘劳动潜力
    本报成都10日电　四川省各地农村把主要力量调到春耕生产第一线。
    目前，各个专区，从县、公社，直到生产队，使用到夏熟作物田间管理和春耕生产战线上的劳动力，一般都占到总劳动力的60％到70％以上。其余劳动力，也根据因地制宜、因时制宜的原则，围绕当前的农事活动进行合理安排。
    为了保证农业生产更大跃进，各地人民公社都从其他方面调出劳力，加强农业生产战线。仪陇县根据当地当时的生产季节需要，对全县社办工业采取各种办法，进行了整顿；如将性质近似的工厂实行合并，并减缩非生产机构，以半劳力换主劳力等办法，抽调出主要劳动力一万三千多人，壮大了农业生产队伍。各公社还在不影响正常收入的情况下，将投放在副业经营上的力量作了适当调整。在副业生产上，一般采取“大忙不搞，小忙小搞，不忙大搞”的原则，灵活掌握，机动使用人力。
    公社举办的各种红专学校，农业中学和其他训练班，也改变原来结合当前生产不够密切的偏向，把学员们的劳动潜力充分发挥出来。南充县各人民公社原来大部分办有农业中学、红专学校，这些社员在学习期间管理的小春作物面积很少，劳动潜力没有充分发挥出来。现在有些红专学校有的由长期改为短期；农业中学一律半工半读，公社划出生产区域交给这些学校学员负责生产。火花公社还动员二百多个劳动力较强，有生产技术的社员，暂时回队参加生产，待农闲时再进行补课。
    后勤工作“五员”及其他非生产人员中身强力壮或生产技术熟练的社员，各地公社也采用强弱调换、改革工具和改变工作方法等办法，把他们抽调出来参加农业生产。川北、川东各地公社集体食堂中，许多都是设有一部分专人负责削红苕皮、拣柴、打猪草等，现在把有些工作分给社员，利用出工之外的休息时间捎带着做，就节省出大批劳动力，参加农业生产。郫县红光公社还培养人人当多面手，组织各种专业队，尽量以女代男，以弱代强，节省出大量强有力的男社员，加强农业战线。　（孙跃冬）
    本报长沙10日电　湖南省安化县采取“排、挖、压、改、管”五项措施，挖掘各方面劳动潜力，使农业出勤人数由原来的二十二万多人，增加到二十七万多人，保证了主攻战线的需要，并且合理安排了其它各线的劳力，以保证其他各项生产任务同时完成。
    安化县委在2月初召开的全县扩大干部会议上，对劳动力进行了算账和摸底，发现劳力有摆布不恰当，很多部门和单位有积压浪费劳动力的现象，不少公社的劳动管理没有跟上，劳动效率没有充分发挥；工具改革也抓得不够有力，工效不高。经过讨论，决定采取“排、挖、压、改、管”五项措施。所谓“排”是本着农业生产为中心，全面跃进为原则，同时又照顾到生产内容复杂的情况，对粮食生产、经济作物、畜牧水产、工交运输和服务性行业所需的劳力比例作了适当安排。“挖”，是围绕生产的服务人员（如食堂人员）太多，从全县各食堂可以“挖”出九千九百多人参加农业生产。“压”，全县将规模大、任务很难完成，收缩后损失不大的大、中水利工程压缩了二十五处，抽出劳力及时转向备耕，减少水利用工八十多万个。“改”，就是大力抓工具改革，以节省人力。“管”，在充分发动群众的基础上，改进劳动管理，全县广泛推行了生产责任制，使生产秩序井然，劳动积极性大大发挥。
    安化县采取这五项措施以来，大大推动了春耕生产。每日积肥量比以前提高了三倍。六万二千多亩秧田已普遍进行了整理。茶、林、牧、渔、副各业也都有专人经营，得到了相应发展。
