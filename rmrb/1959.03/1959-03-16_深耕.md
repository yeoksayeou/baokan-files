Editor's Note: The agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958 created extremely rich experiences. Summarizing these experiences is of great significance for striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year. We plan to publish a series of articles on deep plowing, fertilization, irrigation, seed selection, and close planting, and we hope readers will pay attention.

Soil is the foundation for crop growth and the ground for root system development. Crop roots are rooted in the soil, obtaining the water and nutrients necessary for growth from the soil. The characteristics of the soil can be changed by yield-increasing measures, and the water and nutrients in the soil can be regulated by human power. Good soil management can create conditions for close planting and lay the foundation for high-yield harvests.

The CPC Central Committee pointed out in the "Instructions on Deep Plowing and Soil Improvement": "'Water, fertilizer, soil, seed, and density,' the center is the soil, which is deep plowing." The agricultural bumper harvest practice in 1958 fully demonstrated the great role of deep plowing and soil improvement in increasing agricultural production. The benefits of deep plowing mainly include the following points.

	Deep Plowing Creates a Deep Cultivation Layer

In the agricultural production practice of 1958, while deep plowing, the masses of farmers, combined with advanced measures such as irrigation and drainage, intensive cultivation and fine work, reasonable fertilization, and the integration of soil and fertilizer, accelerated the ripening of raw soil and created a deep cultivation layer.

The main function of deep plowing is to thicken the loose soil layer, improve the physical properties of the soil, regulate the soil's water, air, and temperature conditions, and create conditions for nutrient transformation and biological activity. Deep plowing can cause significant changes in the physical properties of the soil. In the corn experimental field of Mengpai Village, Changge County, Henan Province, the loose layer after deep plowing was thickened from 20 cm to 50 cm, the total porosity increased from 20% to 55%, and the large porosity increased from 5% to 10%. For example, according to materials from the "May Fourth" cooperative of Heshangqiao Township and the Victory First Cooperative of Mengpai Township in the same county, after deep plowing broke the plow pan, the water content of both the topsoil and subsoil reached over 20%, while the water content of the plow pan in fields that were not deep plowed was only 9%. In the high-yield rice experimental field in Baimao Township, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, during the late stage of grain filling of late rice, after the field surface dried, the use of potential measurement methods proved that the aeration layer of fields with a plowing depth of 42 cm was 8 cm thicker than that of fields with a plowing depth of 26 cm. In Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, there were six experimental fields with deep plowing and fertilization. After the same drought period, rice in fields with a plowing depth of 13-16 cm showed more severe drought symptoms than rice in fields with a deep plowing depth of 26 cm. These examples all show that deep plowing thickens the loose soil layer, increases air permeability and water permeability, thereby enhancing the soil's ability to store water and resist drought.

Deep plowing combined with fertilization, especially the application of large amounts of organic fertilizer, can not only further promote the improvement of soil physical properties, but also an effective measure to accelerate the ripening of raw soil after deep plowing. For example, in the wheat high-yield experimental field of the Saishike Farm in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, due to deep plowing and the application of large amounts of organic fertilizer, a 45 cm thick mature soil layer was formed. The soil was not only loose and porous, but also began to form a granular structure. Some people believe that after deep plowing of rice fields, due to frequent irrigation and submersion and the pressure on the lower soil layer, the newly cultivated layer is still prone to reverting to its original compacted and firm state. According to observations in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, it is proved that this view is unfounded, and the soil structure can also be improved after deep plowing of rice fields. Due to the improvement of these physical properties, the contradiction between water and air in the soil is resolved, thereby creating favorable conditions for the activity of aerobic microorganisms, and the number of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes has increased. The analysis results of paddy soil in Changfeng People's Commune, Xiaogan County, showed that the number of beneficial microorganisms in the soil increased by several to dozens of times. Especially in the same soil profile, the number of various microorganisms in the new cultivation layer is roughly the same as the number of microorganisms in the old cultivation layer, which powerfully proves that the deepened cultivation layer of this land has matured. The increase in beneficial microorganisms in the soil, some of which can supply the nutrients necessary for crops themselves, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and more importantly, the activity of beneficial microorganisms promotes the decomposition and transformation of nutrients in the soil that are difficult for crops to absorb, thereby meeting the needs of crops during growth and development.

	Deep Plowing is a Necessary Condition for Applying Large Amounts of Fertilizer

Applying large amounts of fertilizer to fully supply the nutrients needed by crops is an important measure to obtain high yields. Deep plowing expands the space for accommodating fertilizer, providing the possibility for applying large amounts of fertilizer, allowing fertilizer to be dispersed and stored in a thicker soil layer, which not only avoids fertilizer concentration and excessive nutrient concentration, but also meets the needs of crop roots for absorption anytime and anywhere. If a large amount of fertilizer is applied under shallow plowing conditions, due to the excessive concentration of nutrients in the soil, it is easy to cause crop wilting, that is, the commonly called "burning to death," or excessive growth and leaf spreading, and some crops may even lodge and reduce yield as a result. In the late rice field in Tangxia Commune, Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, which was deep plowed to 66 cm and densely planted with 60,000 plants, although 1,500 piculs of fertilizer were applied, of which fine fertilizer accounted for 50%, the yield per mu reached 3,864 catties (gross weight) due to deep plowing and layered fertilization. An analysis of the comparison between deep and shallow plowing of rice fields in Changfeng People's Commune, Xiaogan County, showed that the plowing layer was 20 cm and 14 cm. Under the same conditions of fertilization and dense planting, the deep plowed field did not lodge, while the shallow plowed field lodged during the grain filling period. The hollow grain rate of the former was 5.2%, and the ratio of straw to grain weight was 1.9, while the hollow grain rate of the shallow plowed field was as high as 6.7%, and the ratio of straw to grain weight was 2.3. The yield of the shallow plowed field was 24% lower than that of the deep plowed field. In the corn field of the Ukraine People's Commune in Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, under the same conditions of dense planting and fertilization, the deep plowing field of 40-50 cm had 2% lodging and a yield of 1,308 catties, while the shallow plowing field of 17-23 cm had 8% lodging and a yield of 700 catties. The yield of the deep plowing field was 87% higher than that of the shallow plowing field. The above facts fully show that deep plowing is necessary to apply large amounts of fertilizer.

		Deep Plowing is the Foundation of Dense Planting

Dense planting is an important measure to obtain high-yield harvests. Dense planting of crops requires a larger space for root extension and an area for absorbing nutrients. Deep plowing combined with fertilization can meet this requirement. However, under shallow plowing conditions, it restricts the downward extension of the root system, thereby reducing the area for roots to absorb water and nutrients. In the rice deep plowing comparison field in the Seventh Work Zone of Qingyang Commune, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, under the same conditions of dense planting and fertilization, the root weight per plant in the field with a plowing depth of 40 cm increased by 0.16 grams and the number of roots increased by 32.7 compared to the field with a plowing depth of 13 cm, so it can effectively and evenly utilize the nutrients in the soil, increasing yield by 53.9%. For example, in Lijiaqiao, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, the cotton field with a deep plowing depth of 33 cm was fertilized with 30,000 catties, and the yield per mu was 4,300 plants, the main root was 51 cm long, and the lateral roots were 31. The yield of seed cotton per mu was 738 catties, while the shallow plowing depth was 13 cm, and the fertilization was 12,000 catties. The same number of 4,300 plants per mu, the main root was 32 cm long, and the lateral roots were 14. The yield of seed cotton per mu was 430 catties. The length of the main root of the deep plowing field was 19 cm longer than that of the shallow plowing field, and the lateral roots increased by 17, increasing yield by 71.6%. These examples fully show that after deep plowing is combined with fertilization, the depth of downward extension of the crop root system increases, the root mass increases, promoting the crops to have thick stalks and strong seedlings, obtaining high yields.

	Deep Plowing is Beneficial for Eliminating Weeds and Preventing Plant Diseases and Insect Pests

Deep plowing can break the roots of weeds and reduce the germination of weeds. For example, in the soybean deep plowing experiment in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, the number of perennial weeds in the field with a plowing depth of 20-22 cm was reduced by 21.2% compared with the field with a plowing depth of 12-14 cm. Deep plowing can also turn over the insect eggs, larvae, and pathogens hidden in the deep soil, which is beneficial to reduce or eliminate crop diseases and insect pests. In the rice field of Tangxia Team, Yangzhuang Commune, Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, which was deep plowed to one meter, the rice blast rate was below 1%, while the incidence rate in the rice field with a deep plowing depth of 23 cm reached 70%.

		Rice Crops Also Need Deep Plowing

The rich experience of the agricultural bumper harvest in 1958 fully proves that deep plowing can not only turn thin soil into fertile soil, but also make fertile soil more fertile. In Dongfeng People's Commune, Songjiang County, Shanghai, there were more than 400 mu of rice fields. Due to the lowering of the groundwater level, the improvement of soil moisture conditions, the deepening of the cultivation layer, and the reasonable increase in fertilizer application, the average rice yield jumped from more than 500 catties to about 1,500 catties, and there was no lodging phenomenon. In Xinhua Brigade, Longdian People's Commune, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the deep plowing depth of more than 700 mu of rice fields in the whole brigade was 26-50 cm, combined with a large amount of fertilization, the yield increased by more than eight times compared with 1957. In Wuxing People's Commune, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, a deep mud field (a type of cold soaking field) has been ditching and draining water, increasing the application of natural fertilizer and lime, and thickening the cultivation layer since 1955, so that the rice yield has increased from more than 100 catties to more than 1,000 catties per year. These examples all show that whether it is neutral or acidic paddy soil, fertile soil or infertile soil, as long as the "soil, fertilizer, water" and other measures centered on deep plowing are implemented, soil fertility can be continuously improved and crop yield can be increased. And it powerfully refutes the outdated view that "rice is a shallow-rooted crop and does not need deep plowing." In Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the root mass of rice fields with a deep plowing depth of 26 cm increased by 150% compared with that of deep plowing depth of 13 cm. In Xianfeng People's Commune, Tianjin, the deep plowing depth of rice fields was 148 cm, and the rice roots also extended to below 165 cm. Deep plowing of rice fields creates conditions for root development, which is not only a guarantee for increasing yield, but also has the effect of preventing lodging.

	Deep Plowing is an Effective Method to Improve Poor Soil

Deep plowing not only thickens the loose soil layer, but also improves physical characteristics. In the high-yield field of Saishike Farm, due to deep plowing combined with the application of a large amount of organic fertilizer, a granular structure has begun to form. In the red soil in the south, deep plowing to loosen the soil, applying a large amount of organic fertilizer, and increasing the application of lime and plant ash, can also gradually form a granular structure. The old vegetable garden land in winter has always been deep plowing and heavily fertilized, and the management is even more prominent. That is, paddy soil, although a granular structure may not necessarily be formed after deep plowing and fertilization, it also improves the soil structure and physicochemical properties. This fully shows that deep plowing creates conditions for the application of large amounts of fertilizer, and the integration of soil and fertilizer can accelerate soil ripening, improve soil structure, increase soil water and fertilizer retention capacity, and develop a new theory of labor creating fertile soil. Deep plowing combined with fertilization is not only an effective method to improve general soil, but also an effective method to improve barren soil and saline-alkali soil. For example, in the Hua alkali land in the Xuhuai area of Jiangsu Province, in the comparison experiment in Pei County, after deep plowing of 50 cm, the total salt content of the surface layer dropped from 0.28% to 0.04%; in the Hua alkali land in Lianshui, after deep plowing and turning up the black soil layer below one meter, the corn yield per mu reached 560 catties, an increase of thirteen times compared with the original yield. The reason why deep plowing can achieve the effect of improving saline-alkali soil is mainly to thicken the loose soil layer, cut off the passage of capillary water, inhibit the salt return effect, and at the same time improve the ventilation and water permeability, which is not only conducive to the smooth rooting and growth of crops, but also conducive to the penetration of rainwater, which can accelerate the leaching of salt. If deep plowing is combined with the application of a large amount of organic fertilizer, the effect of improving saline soil is more significant by improving the soil structure. Of course, the improvement of barren soil cannot be completely solved by deep plowing and fertilization. Other improvement measures must also be taken according to the characteristics of different soils. For example, the improvement of saline-alkali soil must focus on establishing a drainage and irrigation system to lower the groundwater level to facilitate salt washing. The transformation of the Tianjin depression is a good example. For soils with heavy alkali, in addition to the above measures, other special measures should also be taken. For example, the "Baijiang soil" in the Yinchuan irrigation area of Ningxia has a relatively high degree of alkalization. In addition to deep plowing and applying organic fertilizer and replacing water with drainage and irrigation, gypsum is applied to make the soil where no grass grows can grow rice, and the yield can reach 300 catties. The improvement of cold soaking fields must also focus on irrigation and drainage to regulate soil moisture and temperature. The improvement of flying sand soil should pay attention to measures such as introducing soil, applying organic fertilizer, planting pasture, planting fruit trees and afforestation. Some low-yield soils should also change the agricultural system in order to achieve the purpose of improving soil and increasing production. The "changing dry land to paddy land" in the Xuhuai area of Jiangsu and the "changing submerged land to dry land" in the Lixiahe area are good examples.

			The Appropriate Depth of Deep Plowing

The appropriate depth of deep plowing must be determined according to different crops, different soils, as well as fertilizer, dense planting, tools and labor. According to the high-yield cases in 1958, generally speaking, it is in line with the current actual situation to promote deep plowing of about one foot in farmland cultivation. From the perspective of different soil characteristics and root development, the limit of deep plowing still needs to be deepened. For example, the dead yellow mud in the south, which is sticky, heavy and barren, needs a deeper deep plowing depth in order to destroy its sticky and firm soil layer; saline-alkali soil also needs a deeper deep plowing depth in order to cut off the capillary to inhibit salt return and facilitate drainage and salt washing; loose and uniform soil also needs a considerable depth in order to increase fertilizer application and thicken the soil ripening layer. However, the appropriate deep plowing depth needs further experimental research.

At the same time as deep plowing, regarding the question of whether the surface layer and raw soil can be disturbed, generally speaking, if the fertilizer cannot keep up, in order to prevent the reduction of surface soil fertility, attention should be paid to not turning up the raw soil. As for whether the soil layer order of the subsoil needs to be maintained, it should be determined according to the characteristics of the soil. In short, deep plowing must grasp the methods suitable for local conditions according to specific requirements and conditions in order to maximize the effect of deep plowing.

    深耕
    中国科学院土壤研究所所长　马溶之
    编者按：1958年农业大跃进的实践，创造了极其丰富的经验。总结这些经验，对争取今年农业生产的更大跃进有很大意义。我们准备连续发表的关于深耕、施肥、灌溉、选种、密植等方面的文章，希望读者注意。
    土是作物生长的基础，是根系生长发育的园地。作物根扎在土里，从土壤中得到生长所必需的水分和养分。土壤的特性可以因增产措施而改变，土壤中的水分和养分可以用人力来调节，良好的土壤管理，可以为密植创造条件，为作物的高额丰产奠定基础。
    中共中央在“关于深耕和改良土壤的指示”中指出：“‘水肥土种密’，中心是土，就是深耕。”1958年农业丰产实践充分地显示了深耕和改良土壤在农业增产中的巨大作用。深耕的好处主要有以下几点。
            深耕创造了深厚的耕作层
    在1958年的农业生产实践中，农民群众在深耕的同时，结合灌溉排水、精耕细作、合理施肥、土肥融和等先进措施，加速了生土的熟化，创造了深厚的耕作层。
    深耕的作用主要是加厚了疏松土层，改善了土壤的物理性状，调节了土壤水分、空气和温度状况，为养分转化和生物活动创造了条件。深耕能使土壤的物理性质发生显著的变化。河南省长葛县孟排村的玉米试验田，深翻后的疏松层从二十厘米增厚至五十厘米，总空隙从20％增加到55％，大空隙从5％增加到10％。又如该县和尚桥乡“五四”一社及孟排乡胜利一社的材料，深耕破坏犁底层后，不论表层或心土的含水量都达20％以上，而未深翻的田，犁底层的含水量只有9％。江苏省常熟县白茆乡丰产水稻试验田，在晚稻灌浆后期，田面落干后，用测定电位方法证明耕深四十二厘米的比耕深二十六厘米的田通气层加厚了八厘米。湖北省孝感县有六块深耕施肥的试验田，经过同一干旱时期以后，耕深十三—十六厘米比深耕二十六厘米的田中水稻旱象较为严重。这些事例，都表明了深耕加厚了疏松土层，增大了通气透水性，从而增强了土壤蓄水抗旱的能力。
    深耕结合施肥，特别是施用大量有机肥料，不仅更能促进土壤物理性状的改善，而且也是加速深翻后生土熟化的有效措施。例如，青海柴达木赛什克农场的小麦丰产试验田，由于深翻和施用大量有机肥料，形成了四十五厘米厚的熟土层，土壤不但疏松多孔，而且开始形成团粒结构。有人认为，水稻田深翻后因经常灌水浸淹而且下部土层承受一定压力新耕作层仍易于回复板结紧实的原状。根据湖北孝感县的观察，证明这种看法是没有根据的，水稻田深翻后，土壤结构同样可以得到改善。由于这些物理性状的改善，解决了土壤中水分与空气的矛盾，从而为好气性微生物的活动创造了有利条件，细菌、真菌和放线菌等的数量均有增加。孝感县长风人民公社水稻土的分析结果表明，土壤中有益微生物的数量增加数倍至数十倍。特别是在同一土壤剖面内，新耕作层中的各种微生物数量和老耕作层中的微生物数量大致相同，有力地证明了这块土地加深的耕作层已经熟化。土壤中有益微生物的增加，有的本身就可以供给作物所必须的养分，如固氮菌，而更重要的是有益微生物的活动，促进了土壤中难为作物吸收的营养物质的分解和转化，从而满足作物生长发育时对养分的需要。
            深耕是大量施肥的必要条件
    大量施肥以充分供给作物所需养分是获得高产的重要措施。深耕扩大了容纳肥料的空间，为大量施肥提供了可能，使肥料分散贮藏于较厚的土层中，既避免了肥料集中、养分浓度过高，又能随时随地满足作物根系吸收的需要。如果在浅耕的条件下，施入大量肥料，由于土壤中养分浓度过高，易于引起作物枯萎即普通所说的“烧死”，或者疯长披叶，某些作物还会因此而倒伏减产。江苏省溧阳县棠下社深翻六十六厘米的晚稻田，密植六万穴，虽施肥一千五百担，而其中细肥占50％，但由于深翻和分层施肥，亩产达到三千八百六十四斤（毛重）。孝感县长风人民公社水稻田深浅耕对比的分析，耕层为二十厘米及十四厘米，在施肥密植相同的情况下，深耕田未倒伏，而浅耕田于灌浆期倒伏，前者空壳率5.2％，藁秆与籽粒重比率为1.9，而浅耕田空壳率高达6.7％，藁秆与籽粒重比率为2.3，浅耕田比深耕田的产量减少24％。江苏省新沂县乌克兰人民公社的玉米田，密植施肥相同的情况下，深耕四十—五十厘米者有2％倒伏，产量一千三百零八斤，浅耕十七—二十三厘米者，有8％倒伏，亩产七百斤，深耕田比浅耕田增产87％。以上的事实，充分说明了要大量施肥就必须深耕。
                深耕是密植的基础
    密植是获得高额丰产的重要措施，作物的密植需要有更大的根系伸展空间和吸收养分的面积，深耕结合了施肥就可以满足这个要求。但在浅耕条件下，就限制了根系向下伸展，从而缩小根系吸收水分与养分的面积。江苏省江阴县青暘公社七工区的水稻深耕对比田，在密植施肥相同的情况下，耕深四十厘米的比耕深十三厘米的每株根系重量增加零点一六克，根数增加三十二点七根，因而可以有效地均匀地利用土壤中的养分，增产53.9％。又如陕西省长安县李家桥，深耕三十三厘米的棉田，施肥三万斤，亩产四千三百株，主根长五十一厘米，侧根三十一根，亩产籽棉七百三十八斤，而浅耕十三厘米的，施肥一万二千斤，每亩同为四千三百株，主根长三十二厘米，侧根十四根，亩产籽棉四百三十斤，深耕的比浅耕的主根长度增加十九厘米，侧根增加十七根，增产71.6％。这些例子都充分说明深耕结合施肥后，作物根系下伸深度增加，根量增多，促使作物的秆粗苗壮，获得高产。
          深耕有利于消灭杂草防治病虫害
    深耕可以挖断草根而减少杂草的萌生，如黑龙江省的安达县大豆深耕试验中，耕深二十—二十二厘米比耕深十二—十四厘米多年生杂草减少了21.2％。深耕还可以翻动藏在深土中的虫卵、幼虫和病菌等，有利于减少或消灭作物的病虫害。江苏省溧阳县杨庄公社棠下队深耕一公尺的稻田，穗颈稻瘟病率在1％以下，而深耕二十三厘米的稻田，发病率即达70％。
              水稻作物同样需要深耕
    1958年农业大丰收的丰富经验，充分证明了深耕不仅可使薄土变肥，而且可使肥土更肥，上海市松江县东风人民公社，有四百余亩水稻田，由于降低了地下水位，改善了土壤水分状况，加深了耕作层，合理增施肥料，水稻平均产量由五百余斤跃增到一千五百斤左右，而且没有倒伏现象。湖北省孝感县龙店人民公社新华大队，全队七百多亩水稻田，深耕二十六—五十厘米，结合大量施肥，比1957年增产八倍多。江西省宜春县五星人民公社一块深泥田（冷浸田的一种），自1955年起，开沟排水，增施自然肥料和石灰，加厚了耕作层，使水稻产量由一百多斤增加到年产一千多斤。这些事例都说明了不论是中性或酸性水稻土，肥土或瘦土，只要贯彻了以深耕为中心的“土、肥、水”等措施，就可以不断提高土壤肥力，增加作物产量。并且有力地驳斥了“水稻是浅根作物，不需要深耕”的陈腐观点。湖北孝感县的水稻田深耕二十六厘米，比深耕十三厘米的根量增加了150％。天津先锋人民公社的水稻田深耕一百四十八公分，水稻根还延伸到一百六十五公分以下。水稻田的深耕为根系发育创造了条件，不但是增产的保证，也有防止倒伏的作用。
          深耕是改良不良土壤的有效方法
    深耕不仅加厚松土层，而且改善了物理特性。赛什克农场的丰产田，由于深耕结合大量施用有机肥料，已开始形成团粒结构。南方的红壤，深翻松土，大量施用有机肥料，增施石灰和草木灰后，也可以逐渐形成团粒结构。冬地的老菜园地一向是深耕和大量施肥的，管理得更突出。就是水稻土，深耕施肥后虽然不一定形成团粒结构，但是也改善了土壤结构和理化特性。这就充分说明，深耕为大量施肥创造了条件，土肥融和可以加速土壤熟化，改善土壤结构，增加土壤的保水保肥能力，发展了劳动创造肥沃土壤的新理论。深耕结合施肥，不仅是改良一般土壤的有效方法，同时也是改良瘠薄土、盐碱土的有效方法。例如，江苏省徐淮地区的花碱地，在沛县的对比试验，深翻五十厘米后，表层含盐总量自0.28％降至0.04％；在涟水的花碱地，经过深翻并将一公尺以下的黑土层翻上来，玉米亩产达五百六十斤，较原产量增加了十三倍。深翻之所以能起到改良盐碱土的效果，主要是加厚了松土层，切断了毛管水的通路，抑制了返盐作用，同时改善了通气透水性能，既利于作物的顺利扎根生长，又利于雨水的渗透，可以加速盐分的淋洗。如果深耕结合了大量施用有机肥料，改善了土壤结构，改良盐土的效果更为显著。瘠薄土的改良当然也不是深耕施肥可以完全解决的，还必须按不同土壤的特性，采取其他各种改良措施。例如盐碱土的改良，必须重视建立排灌系统，降低地下水位，以利洗盐。天津洼地的改造就是一个很好的例证。对于碱重的土壤，除了上述措施外，还应配合其他特殊措施，例如宁夏银川灌区的“白疆土”碱化度相当高，除了深耕施用有机肥料、排灌换水外，施用了石膏，使寸草不生的土壤能够生长水稻，产量可达三百斤。冷浸田的改良也必须重视灌溉排水，以调节土壤的水分和温度。飞砂土的改良就应注意客土、施用有机肥料、种植牧草，栽种果树和造林等措施。有的低产土壤还应改变农业制度，才能达到改良土壤增加生产的目的。江苏徐淮地区的“旱改水”和里下河地区的“沤改旱”，就是很好的例证。
                  深耕的适宜深度
    深耕的适宜深度，必须根据不同作物、不同土壤以及肥料、密植、工具和劳力等情况而定。按1958年的丰产事例，一般的来说，在大田耕作上提倡深耕一尺上下是切合当前实际情况的。就不同土壤特性和根系发育情况来讲，深耕限度还是需要加深的，例如南方的土质粘重瘠薄的死黄泥，就需要较深的深耕深度，以便破坏它的粘重坚实土层；盐碱土同样需要较深的深耕深度，以便切断毛细管抑制返盐，以及有利于排水洗盐；土质松散均匀的土壤，为了增施肥料加厚土壤熟化层，也是需要相当深度的。但是适宜的深耕深度，还需要进一步试验研究。
    在深耕的同时，表层与生土是否可以打乱的问题，一般的说，如果肥料还跟不上，为了防止表层土壤肥力的降低，要注意不把生土翻上来。至于心土的土层是否需要保持原来的土层顺序，就要根据土壤的特性决定。总之，深耕必须根据具体要求和条件，掌握适合当地情况的方法，才能发挥深耕的最大效果。
