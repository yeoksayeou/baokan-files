    Cuban Revolution and its Prospects
    Wilfredo Velázquez Gabreña, Organization Secretary of the Las Villas Province Committee of the Popular Socialist Party of Cuba.
    On January 1, 1959, the Cuban people, through a combination of armed attacks and a revolutionary general strike, overthrew the most brutal and bloody dictatorship in Latin America. The "total achievement" of the dictatorship was the massacre of more than 20,000 men, women, and children, and the barbaric torture of tens of thousands of people. This was carried out by eight special organs for suppressing the revolutionary movement.
    The military committee used by U.S. imperialism in the final moments of Batista's downfall to carry out conspiracies was also immediately dissolved.
    In the struggle against the Batista dictatorship, which was supported to the end by the U.S. State Department, all methods of struggle were used: from protest telegrams, strikes, and rallies, to guerrilla warfare and revolutionary general strikes. Therefore, the downfall of the Batista tyranny was not the result of a coup, but the result of a people's revolution in which the broad masses participated.
    The revolution destroyed the entire structure of the former military and political organs, dissolved the army, police, Supreme Court, House of Representatives, and Senate, and dismissed all mayors and municipal councilors.
    The revolution excluded all reactionary classes from power: the large exporters, semi-feudal landlords, and the giants of the domestic sugar, livestock, and banking industries.
    The result of the revolution was the emergence of a new regime that owed no obligations to imperialism and the above-mentioned reactionary classes. In the final overthrow of the dictatorship, no American mediation or official assistance was accepted. Politically, the established provisional government is the freest government in Cuban history, because its actions and decisions depend only on the rebel army led by Fidel Castro, and supported by various revolutionary organizations and social organizations, and are not constrained by any other forces.
    The basis of the new regime is the majority of the working class, peasants, students, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie. Therefore, the new regime of Cuban freedom and nationality has various possibilities for advancing the revolution; however, it also faces the danger of enemies regrouping and hindering the new regime from completing its tasks.
    We have not forgotten that although the political and military machine of the tyranny has been destroyed, the economic foundations of the social classes that supported the tyranny have not been touched.
    Cuba's economy has always been dependent on U.S. monopolies, and past reactionary governments have been subservient to Washington.
    Most of Cuba's arable land is the property of the United States, most of the sugar mills are American-owned, and so are the banks, telephone, and electricity companies. 80% of imported goods come from the United States. It can be seen that the downfall of the dictatorship was a blow to U.S. imperialism in a region inhabited by only six million people.
    The Cuban people's great victory was achieved first because the people fought with unprecedented courage in unity. This unity was not formal or negotiated, but was generated and developed in the heat of the struggle against tyranny. Workers, peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the strata of the national bourgeoisie that had no connection with imperialism all participated in this struggle. Secondly, the Cuban people no longer believed in the myth that U.S. imperialism was powerful and invincible. The people broke the fatalism restricted by geographical conditions, utilized the favorable international situation, and struck at and even destroyed the pro-imperialist dictatorship. Thirdly, because the Cuban people received great international assistance.
    The great task facing the Cuban people is to defend the revolution and make it develop increasingly to the left. The political foundation of the old state machine has been shattered, but the semi-colonial economic structure that still harms us should also be broken, because it is the root cause of the dictatorship. What imperialism fears most is this. The Yankees are afraid that we will embark on the road of national independence. They have begun to clamor against the Cuban revolution and slander the provisional government's execution of Batista elements. All this is to confuse world opinion and turn it against the Cuban revolution and prepare conditions for intervention in our country.
    However, so far, U.S. imperialism's conspiracy has not succeeded. We believe that they will not succeed in the future, because the entire Cuban people are prepared to defend their sovereignty at any cost, and international public opinion will also prevent such barbaric actions. The vigorous development of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a factor that strikes at (and has already struck at) imperialism's various conspiracies in our country.
    Our revolution is still threatened by an enemy that still has strength, and that is precisely why we appeal to the people of all countries in the world to give our cause—the Cuban revolutionary cause—the strongest spiritual and material support.
    In order for the revolution to move forward, the provisional government should implement the following measures: implement the land law formulated in the Sierra Maestra. Although this land law is still imperfect, it will be an important first step for Cuba to begin land reform; necessary measures should be taken to eliminate the large estate system and distribute the estate land to peasants and agricultural workers; attention should be paid to demands against high living costs, unemployment, and low wages; revise the harsh contracts concluded with imperialism; reduce public utility charges in order to implement nationalization in the future; take measures to protect and develop national industries; implement educational and punitive laws against racial discrimination; implement an independent foreign policy, and establish appropriate diplomatic, economic, cultural, scientific, and sports relations with Asian and African countries that have recently freed themselves from colonial rule, as well as with socialist countries, and so on.
    The above-mentioned measures, as well as other measures, must be implemented to prevent the revolution from remaining purely political and to further change the semi-colonial structure of the country.
    In order to strive for the full realization of the national liberation program, we should move towards a revolutionary provisional government of broad popular unity, which should have not only representatives of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, but also representatives of the proletariat and peasants.
    The Communist Party of Cuba, the Popular Socialist Party of Cuba, which has now obtained complete legal status, actively participated in the guerrilla movement. Although the dictatorship placed it in an underground state, our party continued to work in cities and rural areas, guiding and organizing workers in the united front and in the struggle for democratic rights and the overthrow of tyrannical rule. The party's daily newspaper "Hoy" has been re-published and is being published. The Party has open offices throughout the country. The Party has gained a high reputation and prestige. The Party is growing and constantly deepening its contact with the workers and peasants.

    古巴革命及其前景
    古巴人民社会党拉斯维利亚省组织书记  威尔夫列多·维拉斯克斯·加勃雷腊
    1959年1月1日，古巴人民以武装进攻和革命总罢工的配合行动，推翻了拉丁美洲最残暴的血腥独裁统治。独裁统治的“总成绩”就是：杀戮了两万多名男女老少，对成千上万的人们施行野蛮的酷刑。这是由八个专门镇压革命运动的镇压机关干的。
    美帝国主义在巴蒂斯塔垮台的最后时刻用来进行阴谋活动的军事委员会，也立即被解散。
    在反对由美国国务院支持到底的巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的斗争中，人们使用了所有的斗争方法：从抗议电、罢工、集会，一直到游击战争和革命总罢工。因此，巴蒂斯塔暴政统治的倒台不是一次政变的结果，而是由广大群众参加的人民革命的结果。
    革命摧毁了全部以前的军政机关的结构，解散了军队、警察、最高法院、众议院和参议院，撤销了所有的市长和市政议员的职务。
    革命把所有的反动阶级排斥在政权之外，这些阶级是：大出口商、半封建地主以及本国糖业、畜牧业和银行业的巨头。
    革命的结果是出现了一个不对帝国主义和上述各反动阶级负有任何义务的新政权。在最后推翻独裁统治时并没有接受美国任何调停或官方援助。从政治上看，已经建立的临时政府是古巴历来最自由的政府，因为它的行动和决定只取决于由菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导、并得到各革命组织和社会组织支持的起义军，而不受任何其他力量的约束。
    新政权的基础是大多数的工人阶级、农民、学生、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。因此，古巴自由和民族性的新政权具有使革命向前发展的各种可能性；但是，它也面临着敌人重整旗鼓、阻碍新政权完成各项任务的危险。
    我们并没有忘记，暴政统治的政治军事机器虽然已经被摧毁，但是还没有触动支持暴政统治的社会阶级的经济基础。
    古巴在经济上一直依赖美国垄断企业，过去历届反动政府都听命于华盛顿。
    古巴的大部分可耕地是美国的财产，大部分制糖厂是美国人的，银行、电话和电力企业也是他们的，80％的进口货物来自美国。由此可见，独裁统治的倒台就是人口只有六百万的人民在美帝国主义统治领域内给它的一个打击。
    古巴人民之所以取得这样伟大的胜利，首先因为人民团结一致以空前的勇敢精神进行战斗，这种团结不是形式的和商定的，而是在反暴政统治的斗争热潮中产生和发展的。工人、农民、城市小资产阶级以及民族资产阶级中与帝国主义没有联系的阶层都参加了这个斗争。其次是古巴人民已经不再相信美帝国主义是强大和不可战胜的神话。人民打破了受地理条件限制的宿命论，利用了有利的国际形势，打击甚至摧毁了亲帝国主义的独裁统治。第三是因为古巴人民得到了伟大的国际援助。
    古巴人民面临的巨大任务是保卫革命，并使它日益向左发展。旧的国家机器的政治基础已经被粉碎了，但是还应该打破现在还使我们遭受损害的半殖民地经济结构，因为它是造成独裁统治的根源。帝国主义最害怕的就是这一着，美国佬害怕我们走上民族独立的道路，他们开始叫嚷着反对古巴革命，对临时政府处决巴蒂斯塔分子进行诬蔑。所有这一切都是为了混淆世界舆论，并使之转而反对古巴革命和准备条件对我国进行干涉。
    但是，到现在为止，美帝国主义的阴谋并未成功。我们认为，他们在将来也不会成功，因为古巴全体人民准备不惜任何代价保卫自己的主权，而国际舆论也将制止这种野蛮行动。以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的蓬勃发展，是使帝国主义在我国的种种阴谋受到打击（而且已经遭到了打击）的因素。
    我们的革命还受着一个还有实力的敌人的威胁，正因为如此，我们才向世界各国人民呼吁给予我们的事业——古巴的革命事业——以最有力的精神和物质支援。
    为了革命向前发展，临时政府应该执行以下措施：执行在马埃斯特腊山制订的土地法。尽管这个土地法还是不完善的，但它将是古巴开始进行土地改革的重要的第一步；应该采取必要措施来消灭大庄园制度，把庄园的土地分给农民和农业工人；应该关心反对生活高昂、反对失业、反对工资低微的要求；修改与帝国主义订立的苛刻的合同；降低公用事业的收费，以便今后实行国有化；采取措施保护和发展民族工业；实行反对种族歧视的教育和处罚的法律；执行独立的对外政策，同最近摆脱殖民主义统治的亚非各国以及社会主义国家建立应有的外交、经济、文化、科学和体育关系，等等。
    上述措施以及其他的措施必须执行，以使革命不停留在纯政治的意义上，并进而改变国家的半殖民地结构。
    为了争取全部实现民族解放纲领，我们应该向着广泛人民联合的革命临时政府的方向前进，这个政府不仅要有资产阶级和小资产阶级的代表，而且也要有无产阶级和农民的代表。
    古巴共产主义者的政党古巴人民社会党现在已经取得了完全合法的地位，它曾积极参加游击运动。尽管独裁统治使它处在地下状态，我们的党仍在城市和农村进行工作，在统一战线和争取民主权利、推翻暴政统治的斗争中引导和组织工人。党的日报“今日报”已经复刊，并且正在出版。党在全国各地都有公开的办公处。党已取得了很高的声誉和威信。党正在成长和不断深入地同工农群众进行联系。
