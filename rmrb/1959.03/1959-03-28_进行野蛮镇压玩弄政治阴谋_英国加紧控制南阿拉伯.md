Carrying Out Savage Suppression and Engaging in Political Intrigue
Britain Intensifies Control of South Arabia

    This newspaper reports that British authorities are carrying out large-scale military base construction projects in southern Arabia. The bases are scattered throughout Aden and other areas of southern Arabia. Once completed, they can garrison 70,000 soldiers, 1,000 aircraft, 500 tanks and other military equipment, and atomic weapons. According to South Arabian League disclosures, bases located in Unuq, Maikiras, Rayyan, Zala, and Beihan have already been completed. The Unuq base will be equipped with atomic weapons.
    The activity of constructing a large-scale military base network in this region is part of Britain's plan to protect its colonial interests in the Middle East and suppress the national independence movements in the Middle East. Along the Persian Gulf coast and in southern Arabia, Britain still controls a large contiguous area of ​​colonies, totaling more than 1.5 million square kilometers. In recent years, the people of this region have launched unremitting struggles against British colonial rule. In addition to implementing frantic military suppression, the British colonial authorities have also engaged in the conspiracy of establishing a "federation," using certain puppet chiefs to intensify their control over the region. The so-called "federation" established on February 11—the "Federation of Arab Emirates of the South," including six protectorates in the Aden region—and the so-called "Arabian Gulf Federation," which is currently being planned and includes the three regions of Oman, Bahrain, and Muscat, are all for this purpose. The aforementioned base network was established in accordance with the "constitution" of the "Federation of Arab Emirates of the South."
    With the establishment of the puppet federation and the commencement of the base project, Britain's armed suppression of the national independence movement in the region has also been strengthened. In the Oman region alone, Britain recently sent 10,000 troops, of which 7,000 came from the Aden base and the rest from British Cameroon.

    进行野蛮镇压玩弄政治阴谋
    英国加紧控制南阿拉伯
    本报讯  英国当局正在阿拉伯半岛南部进行大规模的军事基地建筑工程。基地分散于亚丁和阿拉伯半岛南部其他地区，全部建成以后，可驻扎七万名士兵、一千架飞机、五百辆坦克和其他军用装备以及原子武器。据南阿拉伯联盟揭露，位于乌努克、迈基拉斯、赖扬、扎拉和贝汉等地的基地，目前已经建成。其中乌努克基地将配备原子武器
    在这个地区建筑大规模军事基地网的活动，是英国保护其在中东的殖民利益、镇压中东民族独立运动的计划的一部分。在波斯湾沿岸和阿拉伯半岛的南部，英国目前仍然控制着联成一片的大块殖民地，总面积达一百五十多万平方公里。近几年来，这个地区的人民展开了不懈的斗争，反对英国的殖民统治。英国殖民当局除了实行疯狂的军事镇压外，并且玩弄了建立“联邦”的阴谋，利用某些傀儡酋长，加紧对这个地区的控制。2月11日成立的包括亚丁地区六个保护国在内的所谓“联邦”——“阿拉伯南部酋长国”，以及目前仍在筹划中的包括阿曼、巴林和马斯喀特三个地区的所谓“阿拉伯湾联邦”，都是为了这个目的。上述基地网就是根据“阿拉伯南部酋长国”的“宪法”建立的。
    随着傀儡联邦的建立和基地工程的开展，英国对这个地区民族独立运动的武装镇压也有了加强。仅在阿曼地区，英国最近就派去了一万名军队，其中七千人来自亚丁基地，其余来自英属喀麦隆。
