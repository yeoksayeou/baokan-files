As we excitedly and joyfully commemorate the 1959 "March 8th" International Women's Day, I, on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, extend warm congratulations to the sisters in the capital, to the sisters throughout the country, and to the foreign friends present here! I would also like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt greetings and gratitude to the female experts and experts' wives from the socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, and other countries who have come to our country to help with construction!

    The socialization of housework has greatly liberated the vast female workforce.
From "March 8th" last year to "March 8th" this year, this has been an unprecedentedly great year since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In this year, under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a vigorous mass movement has been launched on all fronts, enabling our socialist construction to achieve unprecedented great achievements in industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, and health. The vast rural areas have realized the people's commune system, forming a new situation of a nationwide and comprehensive great leap forward.

In this new situation, the women's movement in our country has leaped to a new historical stage. First, it is manifested in the participation of the vast number of women in various social production labors. Almost all women with labor ability in rural areas have participated in various labors of the people's communes, and have become a main force in agricultural production. The hard work of women has played an extremely important role in the great agricultural harvest of 1958. In the mass movement of running industry with steel as the key link, Chinese women, like men, bravely plunged into the torrent of large-scale steelmaking. Women have participated in large numbers in other various industries, transportation, and financial and trade work. The number of female employees in 1958 jumped from more than 3 million in 1957 to more than 7.5 million, becoming an important force in the rapid development of industry and transportation.

On the cultural, educational, medical, health, science, and art fronts, women have made outstanding contributions. They have studied cultural and scientific knowledge diligently, carried out inventions and creations bravely, and made outstanding contributions in improving tools and studying science and technology, some of whom have been hired as scientific researchers. In the past year, tens of millions of working women have escaped illiteracy, and many of them have achieved good results in culture and art, and many female poets and female painters have emerged. Many intellectual women have gone deep into labor practice, worked hard to improve their awareness, and studied their professions deeply, accelerating their progress towards becoming both red and expert.

The leap of the women's movement to a new historical stage is also manifested in the socialization of housework. Due to the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various socialist constructions, and at the urgent request of the broad masses of people, especially women, collective living welfare undertakings have developed rapidly accordingly. Now, whether in cities or rural areas, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, homes for the elderly, sewing factories, laundry groups, etc. have been established everywhere. The tedious housework undertaken by women for thousands of years has become a social collective undertaking. The vast female workforce has been greatly liberated. They can work, study, rest, and participate in cultural entertainment like men. Women are rejoicing and smiling. This great change in social life has not only won the heartfelt support of women, but also made men, women, old and young, live better, and enabled the vast number of children to receive better care and education from society and families. The feudal patriarchal system has been broken, and quarrels due to trivial family matters have been greatly reduced. Family life has become more democratic, united, and happier. Children receive better parental care in harmonious families, and an atmosphere of respecting the old and loving the young, unity, mutual assistance, and friendship pervades our family life.

    Profound changes in mental outlook, working hard and happily with men.
With the fundamental changes in women's social production and social life, women's mental outlook has undergone extremely profound changes, which is also a sign of the leap of the women's movement to a new stage. In the past year, we could see women everywhere being energetic, high-spirited, and where the Party pointed, they rushed. In particular, they have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, overcome inferiority, and established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act; they have promoted the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation; and they have made great achievements on various fronts of socialist construction that no one has ever made before.

Dear sisters, friends! As this time of renewal of all things and flourishing spring arrives, the high tide of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward production in 1959 has already unfolded throughout the country. The Party's Eighth National Congress, Sixth Plenary Session, put forward the grand national economic development policy for 1959, and the four major indicators of steel, grain, and cotton have become the goals of struggle for the people of the whole country. On the industrial front, people in various places are striving to complete the tasks of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, and other industrial production and capital construction; striving to complete and overfulfill the annual plan has become the realistic goal of intense labor and enthusiastic competition for people in various places. On the agricultural front, people in various places are striving to produce 1,050 billion jin of grain, 100 million dan of cotton, and a series of other agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production plans; the preparatory farming movement centered on accumulating fertilizer is being carried out vigorously on the land of our motherland. On the financial, trade, cultural, educational, health, and art fronts, people in various places are also working hard to realize the 1959 leap forward plan.

From the coastal defense front of our motherland, all the way to the interior, from the south all the way to the north, from the city all the way to the countryside, we can see our women working hard and happily shoulder to shoulder with men everywhere, using the results of actual labor to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. Now, women all over the country are using the actual actions of the great leap forward to welcome this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day. Female workers, female commune members, and women from all walks of life in many factories in the capital are carrying out a meritorious service competition to present gifts to the "March 8th" Festival!

    Five Expectations for Sisters Across the Country
When the masses of women set off a production upsurge to commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th, we must also see that this is only a good start to 1959; to complete the country's construction plan for 1959, we must go through arduous efforts by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party, which is by no means easy. Our women must go all out and make a great leap forward, do things practically, and carry out creative labor diligently. To this end, I would like to put forward the following five expectations to sisters across the country:

    Launch a vigorous technical revolution to open up a broader path for women to participate in labor.
First, launch a vigorous technical revolution. We women must actively participate in the production movement centered on technical revolution that is being carried out throughout the country, work hard to learn advanced technologies, engage in technical innovation in a big way, improve tools in every possible way, combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work, so as to greatly improve labor productivity and give full play to the active role of women. For women, only through the technical revolution movement can we open up a broader path for women to participate in labor, give fuller play to women's strength, reduce labor intensity, and fundamentally protect the female labor force. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Only when class society no longer exists, when heavy labor is automated, and when agriculture is mechanized, can true equality between men and women be truly realized." From last year to now, women's federations in various places, under the leadership of the Party, have advocated and encouraged women to actively participate in the technical revolution; some places have already launched or are launching a vigorous mass movement, such as the "Million Girls Bumper Harvest Movement," the "Clever Girls" movement, the "Million Women Technical Innovators" movement, etc., which have all achieved or are achieving remarkable results. We firmly believe that as long as our women further overcome inferiority and conservative thinking, more firmly establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, study diligently, and work hard, then we will surely be able to show our talents in the technical revolution movement and make outstanding achievements.

    Working hard to improve collective welfare undertakings is equal to producing more grain and more steel for the country.
Second, vigorously consolidate and improve collective living welfare undertakings. On the basis of the great leap forward in production and the people's commune movement in 1958, collective living welfare undertakings in rural and urban areas have greatly developed. According to the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress, Sixth Plenary Session, through the work of rectifying people's communes last winter and this spring, these emerging undertakings have been consolidated and improved. A few parents who originally had concerns and doubts about childcare organizations have turned to trust and love them; a few people who originally feared that they would not eat well in public canteens now feel satisfied and satisfied. All the people in rural areas have joined public canteens, and the number of people eating in canteens in cities has generally increased. Due to the good management of collective living welfare undertakings, the labor enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved, labor efficiency has increased rapidly, and the level of health is also improving.

However, it must be seen that in our country, collective living welfare undertakings have been held on a large scale for a short time, with insufficient experience, and some problems remain to be further resolved; especially due to the need for a greater leap forward in production, which requires the masses of people to be energetic and vigorous in production, and the material and cultural life requirements of the masses will inevitably continue to increase with the leap forward in production, so we must constantly improve and improve the level of collective living welfare work. We must do collective welfare undertakings better and more economically in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Canteens must adhere to the principle of careful calculation and thrift, and strive to make meals nutritious, varied, and clean and hygienic, and take into account the special needs of lying-in women, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, the elderly, and patients as much as possible; at present, we must especially strive to improve cooking tools and constantly improve work efficiency. In terms of childcare and kindergarten work, we must proceed from reality, adapt to local conditions, and adopt flexible organizational forms according to the needs of production development and the masses. At present, it is right for various places to vigorously run day-care nurseries and kindergartens, but according to the needs of production development and mothers, we should also actively run full-time care in places with basic conditions. Those that have already been established should continue to be run as long as the masses need them, and they must be run well. While consolidating and improving kindergartens, special attention should be paid to running nurseries well. Children in nurseries are generally under the age of three, young, and have weak resistance, and whether the physical development is good or not during infancy and early childhood has a significant impact on the children's future growth.

Most of those who work in collective welfare undertakings are women, and we must work hard to do this glorious work well. Cooks who cook good meals and teachers who take good care of children are equal to producing more grain and more steel for the country, and contributing to the completion of the country's construction plan this year. At present, many women's federation cadres in many regions have gone deep into nurseries, kindergartens, and public canteens to try out "experimental fields," acting as teachers and cooks, and in actual work, they jointly study work with local cadres, summarize and promote experience. This style and method of caring about the lives of the masses and getting personally involved deserves great advocacy and promotion.

An important method to improve collective living and welfare work is to constantly improve the political and professional level of cooks, caregivers, childcare workers, midwives, and managers. Since last winter and this spring, many provinces, cities, counties, and communes are training or have trained a large number of caregivers, cooks, and so on. According to current experience, this method of conducting short-term training at all levels can help them establish a sense of honor in loving their work and correct their service attitude; it can help them acquire basic professional knowledge and skills, so this training is necessary and must continue to be held in large quantities. However, short-term training can only solve certain problems for a certain period of time. To improve political and ideological level and professional level in the long term, we must rely on exercise in regular work, and we must rely on regular education and help. Some regions now adopt the policy of combining short-term intensive training and long-term guidance for caregivers, which is very good. On the basis of short-term training, continuing to advocate the method of central childcare organizations guiding other childcare organizations, and public childcare organizations guiding private childcare organizations is a good way to give play to the collective wisdom of caregivers, help each other, and make progress together. Some places with good conditions also run amateur normal schools for early childhood education, and systematically train on-the-job caregivers for a long time. These methods are all worthy of vigorous promotion in various places according to local actual conditions.

    Constantly improve your socialist and communist awareness and enhance collectivist viewpoints.
Third, to do a good job in production and life, we must adhere to the principle of putting politics in command and ideology first. Therefore, under the education of the Party, our women must constantly improve their socialist and communist awareness. In cities, a large number of housewives have participated in social labor, that is, they have participated in organized and disciplined social collective labor. At the beginning, there will be difficulties and ideological struggles. After the rural people's commune system, the degree of collectivization of production and life has been greatly improved compared with the past; at the same time, a distribution system combining wage system and supply system has been implemented; these are all fresh things that have never been experienced before, and the degree of understanding and adaptation of women to these new things is naturally not completely the same. After the socialist and communist ideological education movement and the work of rectifying the communes last winter and this spring, the ideological awareness of urban and rural women has been significantly improved, and the conscious and selfless labor attitude of the majority of women is a concrete manifestation of the improvement of ideological awareness. However, the relevant leadership must still conduct political and ideological education frequently, care about the special circumstances of women, and help them correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the collective and the country. Our women themselves must adapt to the needs of the development of the situation, work hard to improve their awareness, and enhance collectivist viewpoints. Many regions have achieved good results in improving women's ideological awareness, exchanging advanced experience, and promoting production and work by establishing banners, setting benchmarks, and launching a mass movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced on the basis of organizing women to speak out freely, debate freely, and put up big-character posters, which is worthy of promotion.

    Cultivate and improve female backbones so that they can lead the vast masses of women to make continuous leaps forward.
Fourth, in order to lead the vast masses of women to make continuous leaps forward, we must always pay attention to cultivating and promoting female backbones. In the great leap forward in 1958 and the people's commune movement, a large number of both red and expert female activists and female backbones emerged in both urban and rural areas, and their number has exceeded several times or even dozens of times more than in the past. On the other hand, due to the fact that people's communes are large and public organizations, the leadership backbones have many tasks and heavy responsibilities. In urban street residents' work, most of the cadres were women in the past. Now, with the development of urban construction, the vast number of housewives have transferred to social labor, and the original female backbones lack experience in leading production and organizing collective life. In the face of this new historical task, consciously and systematically training female backbones to participate in the leadership of production and life organizations is extremely important for giving play to the enthusiasm of the vast masses of women. At present, many provinces, cities, counties, and people's communes throughout the country have insisted on implementing the central government's instruction of "every commune has a female commune head, and every team has a female team leader," and there are a certain number of female cadres in the positive and deputy heads of people's communes, production brigades (cultivation areas), and production teams. However, some people's communes have not paid attention to equipping female backbones in the leadership structures at all levels. It is hoped that the relevant leadership will combine the rectification of the communes and the preparatory farming movement to cultivate and promote female backbones as early as possible in a planned and conscious manner, and participate in the leadership of the people's communes at all levels. In state-owned factories, mines, shops, and other enterprises and service undertakings with a large number of women participating, it is also necessary to strengthen the cultivation of female backbones. Our female cadres themselves should help each other and learn from each other in their work, work hard to improve their political, professional, and production technology level, and truly complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the masses.

    Pay attention to protecting women's health to maintain lasting vigorous energy.
Fifth, when this new production upsurge is being carried out throughout the country, and women on all fronts are working hard and enthusiastically in selfless labor, in order to maintain lasting vigorous energy, our women must pay attention to protecting their health while giving play to a high degree of production enthusiasm. Since the publication of the resolution of the Party's Eighth National Congress, Sixth Plenary Session, various places have paid more attention to protecting female labor force on the original basis. Many places have achieved "be sure to ensure that women have full rest before and after childbirth, and women must also be given necessary rest during menstruation, and do not do heavy work, do not go down to cold water, and do not stay up late." In all places where this is done, women's enthusiasm for production and labor is further improved, production tasks are also better completed, and women's health is also correspondingly increased; therefore, whether from the long-term interests or the immediate interests, giving play to women's labor enthusiasm and protecting women's health are consistent and not contradictory. Our women should consciously pay attention to implementation. At the same time, we must also conduct publicity to all relevant parties. For those who have resistance to protecting women's labor, we must patiently explain.

In 1959, while striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in domestic socialist construction, Chinese women should contribute more to defending world peace. The unprecedented leap forward in the socialist construction of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, especially the brilliance of the Soviet Union's great seven-year plan for national economic development, inspires our confidence in construction; at the same time, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing rapidly and magnificently, while the economic crisis and mutual contradictions of the imperialist camp headed by the United States are deepening day by day, and the entire international situation fully proves that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind and will continue to prevail further over the West wind, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. In this international situation that is completely conducive to our construction, Chinese women must work harder to enhance the strength of defending world peace with the achievements of construction; we must warmly respond to the appeal to women of the world issued by the Executive Bureau of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and work hard to stop nuclear weapons tests, ban all nuclear weapons, and demand disarmament; we also need to better strengthen unity and mutual assistance with women in socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and learn from their advanced construction experience humbly and forever; strive to support the national liberation struggles of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and better develop friendly cooperation with peace-loving women in all countries of the world; so as to work together with peace-loving people all over the world to strive for greater victories in the cause of world peace and human progress!

    鼓足干劲踏踏实实办事情
    蔡畅在首都各界妇女纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上的讲话（摘要）
    在我们大家兴奋愉快地纪念1959年“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我谨代表中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会，向首都姊妹们，向全国姊妹们，向在座的各国朋友们，致以热烈的祝贺，并趁这个机会向以苏联为首的各社会主义国家和其他各国来到我国帮助进行建设的女专家和专家夫人们表示衷心的慰问和感谢！
    家务劳动社会化，广大妇女
        劳动力得到了极大的解放
    从去年“三八”到今年“三八”，这是中华人民共和国成立以来，空前伟大的一年。在这一年中，在党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线光辉照耀下，在各个战线上，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，使我国社会主义建设事业无论在工业上、农业上、商业上和文化、教育、卫生事业上都获得了史无前例的伟大成就，广大的农村实现了人民公社化，形成了全民全面大跃进的新形势。
    在这种新的形势下，我国妇女运动跃进到了一个新的历史阶段。首先表现在我国广大妇女参加了各项社会生产劳动。农村有劳动能力的妇女几乎全都参加了人民公社的各种劳动，并一跃成为农业生产上的主力。妇女们的辛勤劳动，对1958年的农业大丰收起了极重大的作用。在以钢为纲的大办工业的群众运动中，我国妇女同男子一样，英勇地投入大炼钢铁的洪流。妇女们大量参加了其他各种工业、交通运输业和财贸工作，1958年女职工数量，由1957年的三百余万人跃增到七百五十余万人，她们成为工业、交通运输业飞跃发展中的一支重要力量。
    在文化、教育、医药、卫生、科学、艺术战线上，妇女们都有了出色的贡献。她们刻苦地学习文化科学知识，勇敢地进行发明创造，在改良工具、钻研科学技术方面作出了出色的贡献，其中有些人被聘为科学研究员。去年一年中，有几千万劳动妇女摆脱了文盲状态，其中有不少人还在文化艺术方面取得了很好的成绩，出现了不少女诗人、女画家。许多知识妇女，深入劳动实践，努力提高觉悟，深钻业务，向又红又专的方向加速前进。
    妇女运动跃进到新的历史阶段，又表现在家务劳动的社会化。由于工农业生产和社会主义各项建设大跃进的需要，在广大人民特别是妇女群众迫切要求下，集体生活福利事业相应地迅速地发展起来，现在不论城市或者农村，到处办起了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院、敬老院、缝纫厂、洗衣组等等，几千年来由妇女承担的繁琐的家务劳动，变成了社会集体事业，广大妇女劳动力得到了极大的解放，她们能够和男子一样，同劳动、同学习、同休息、同参加文化娱乐，妇女们欢欣鼓舞，笑逐颜开。这种社会生活的伟大变更，不仅获得了妇女们的衷心拥护，而且使男女老少，生活得更好，使广大儿童得到社会和家庭更好的关怀和教养。破除了封建家长制度，因家庭琐事而争吵的事情大大减少了，家庭生活也更加民主团结，更加幸福。孩子们在和睦的家庭里得到父母更好的爱抚，尊老爱幼，团结、互助、友爱的气氛洋溢在我们的家庭生活之中。
    精神面貌有了深刻变化，
      和男子一起紧张而愉快劳动
    随着妇女在社会生产和社会生活方面所发生的根本性变化，妇女们的精神面貌有了极为深刻的变化，这也是妇女运动跃进到新阶段的一个标志。在去年一年中，到处可以看到妇女们精神焕发，斗志昂扬，党指向那里她们就奔向那里；特别是破除了迷信，解放了思想，克服了自卑，树立了敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格；发扬了互助协作的共产主义精神；在社会主义建设的各个战线上干出了前人从来没有做出过的伟大成绩。
    亲爱的姊妹们，朋友们！当这万物更新，欣欣向荣的大好春光到来的时候，我们1959年的更大更好更全面的跃进的生产高潮已经在全国范围内展开了。党的八届六中全会所提出的1959年国家宏伟的国民经济发展的方针和钢铁粮棉四大指标已经成为全国人民奋斗的目标。在工业战线上，各地人民正在为完成一千八百万吨钢、三亿八千万吨煤和其他工业生产、基本建设任务而奋斗；争取完成和超额完成全年的计划已经成为目前各地人民紧张劳动热烈竞赛的现实目标。在农业战线上，各地人民正在为生产一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担棉花和其他一系列的农、林、牧、副、渔的生产计划而奋斗；目前以积肥为中心的备耕运动，正在我们祖国的大地上轰轰烈烈地开展着。在财经、贸易、文教、卫生、艺术等各个战线上，各地人民也正在努力实现1959年跃进计划。
    从我们祖国的海防前线，一直到内地，从南方一直到北方，从城市一直到农村，我们到处可以看到我们妇女和男子一起，肩并肩地紧张而愉快劳动，用实际劳动的成果来争取1959年的更大更好更全面地跃进。现在我们全国各地妇女都正用大跃进的实际行动来迎接今年“三八”国际妇女节。首都许多工厂的女工人、女社员和其他各界妇女正在开展立功竞赛，向“三八”节献礼！
        对全国姊妹的五点期望
    在妇女群众掀起生产热潮纪念三八国际妇女节的时候，我们还要看到，这仅仅是1959年的良好的开端；要完成1959年国家的建设计划，必须在党的领导下经过全国人民艰巨的努力，决不是轻而易举的。我们妇女一定要鼓足干劲大跃进，踏踏实实办事情，勤勤恳恳地进行创造性的劳动。为此特向全国姊妹们提出下列五点期望：
      大闹技术革命，为妇女开辟参加劳动
  更宽广的门路
    第一，大闹技术革命。现在全国各地正在开展的以技术革命为中心的生产运动，我们妇女一定要积极参加，努力学习先进技术，大搞技术革新，千方百计地改良工具，把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，从而大大提高劳动生产率，充分发挥妇女积极作用。对妇女来说，只有通过技术革命运动，才能为妇女开辟参加劳动更宽广的门路，才能更充分地发挥妇女的力量，才能减轻劳动强度，才能从根本上保护妇女劳动力。毛主席早已指出：“只有当阶级社会不存在了，笨重的劳动都自动化了，农业也机械化了的时候，才能真正实现男女平等。”从去年到现在，各地妇联在党的领导下，提倡和鼓励了妇女积极参加技术革命；有些地方已经或正在开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，例如“百万姑娘丰产运动”，“巧姑娘”运动，
  “百万妇女技术革新者”运动，等等，都已经和正在做出了显著的成效。我们深信，只要我们妇女更进一步克服自卑保守思想，更巩固地树立敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，勤学苦练刻苦钻研，那就一定能在技术革命运动中大显身手，做出出色的成绩。
      努力搞好集体福利事业等于为国家多
  打粮食多产钢
    第二，大力巩固和提高集体生活福利事业。在1958年生产大跃进和人民公社化运动的基础上，农村和城市的集体生活福利事业都有极大的发展，根据党的八届六中全会的精神，通过去冬今春整顿人民公社的工作，这些新兴的事业都得到了巩固和提高。原来有少数对托儿组织有顾虑怀疑的家长，转为信赖和热爱，原来有少数怕在公共食堂吃不好饭的人，现在感到称心满意，农村全体人民加入了公共食堂，城市参加食堂吃饭的人普遍增加了。由于集体生活福利事业办好了，人民群众的劳动积极性大大提高了，劳动效率迅速增长，健康水平也正在提高之中。
    但是必须看到在我们国家，大规模地举办集体生活福利事业，时间很短，经验不足，有些问题还有待于进一步解决；特别由于生产更大跃进的需要，要求人民群众精力充沛，生龙活虎似地投入生产，而人民群众的物质文化生活的要求必将随着生产的跃进而不断地增长，因此我们必须不断地提高和改进集体生活福利工作的水平。我们要在人力物力财力方面把集体福利事业办得更好更省，食堂要在精打细算节约的原则下，做到饭菜富有营养、花样翻新和清洁卫生，尽可能照顾到产妇、孕妇、哺乳母亲、小孩、老人和病人的特殊需要；当前特别要努力改进炊事工具，不断提高工作效率。在托儿所、幼儿园工作方面，要根据生产发展和群众的需要，从实际出发，因地制宜，采用灵活的组织形式。目前，各地大力办好日托的托儿所和幼儿园是对的，但是根据生产发展和母亲需要在具有基本条件的地方，也应积极办好全托，已经办起来的，只要群众需要，应坚持办下去，而且一定要办好。在巩固和提高幼儿园的同时，特别要注意办好托儿所。托儿所的孩子一般都在三岁以下，年龄小，抵抗力薄弱，而婴儿幼儿时期，体质发育得好不好对孩子以后的成长有着重大的影响。
    在集体福利事业岗位上担任工作的，大多数是妇女，我们要努力把这光荣的工作做好，炊事员做好了饭，保教人员带好了孩子，也就是等于为国家多打粮食多产钢，为完成今年国家建设计划贡献了力量。现在不少地区的妇联干部，深入到托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂在那里试办“试验田”，当保教人员、炊事员，在实际工作中，和当地干部共同研究工作，总结和推广经验。这种关心群众生活和亲自动手的作风和工作方法，值得大大提倡和推广。
    而提高和改进集体生活福利工作的重要方法是经常不断地提高炊事员、教养员、保育员、助产员、管理人员的政治和业务水平。去冬今春以来，许多省、市、县、公社正在或者已经训练了大量保教人员、炊事员等等。根据现在的经验看来，这种各级分层进行短期训练的办法，可以帮助她们树立热爱工作的光荣感，端正服务态度；可以帮助她们获得基本的业务知识和技能，因此这种训练是必要的，还必须继续大量的举办。但是短期训练到底只能解决一定时期一定的问题，长期地提高政治思想水平和业务水平，还必须依靠在经常工作中锻炼，还必须依靠经常的教育和帮助，有些地区现在对保教人员，采取短期集训、长期辅导相结合的方针，是非常好的。在短期训练的基础上，继续提倡中心托儿组织辅导其他托儿组织，公办托儿组织辅导民办托儿组织等办法，是发挥保教人员集体智慧、互相帮助、共同进步的好办法。有些条件好的地方，还举办业余幼稚师范，有计划地长期地培养在职的保教人员，这些办法，都是值得各地根据当地实际情况，大力推广的。
      经常不断地提高自己的社会主义、共
  产主义觉悟，增进集体主义观点
    第三，要搞好生产，搞好生活，都要坚持政治挂帅，思想先行的原则。因此我们妇女必须在党的教育下，经常不断地提高自己的社会主义共产主义觉悟。在城市中，大量的家庭妇女参加了社会劳动，也就是说参加了有组织有纪律的社会集体劳动，在开始时，不会没有困难的，也不会是没有思想斗争的。农村人民公社化以后，生产和生活集体化的程度比过去大大提高；同时又实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度；这些都是从来没有经历过的新鲜事物，在妇女群众中对这些新事物的认识程度是不完全一样的，适应的程度也不完全一致也是很自然的。经过了去冬今春的社会主义共产主义思想教育运动和整社工作，城乡妇女的思想觉悟又有了显著的提高，大多数妇女自觉的、忘我的劳动态度，正是思想觉悟提高的具体表现。但是有关领导方面还必须经常地进行政治思想教育，关心妇女的特殊情况，帮助她们正确地处理个人与集体、集体与国家之间的关系问题。而我们妇女自己，更必须适应形势发展的需要，努力提高自己的觉悟，增进集体主义观点。许多地区在组织妇女大鸣、大放、大辩论的基础上，树立旗帜，立标兵，大搞学先进、赶先进、超先进的群众运动，对提高妇女的思想觉悟，交流先进经验和推动生产和工作方面都取得了很好的效果，这是值得推广的。
      培养和提高妇女骨干，使她们带领广
  大妇女群众不断跃进
    第四，为了带领广大妇女群众不断地跃进，必须经常注意培养和提拔妇女骨干。在1958年大跃进及人民公社化运动中，不论城市和农村都涌现了大量又红又专的妇女积极分子和妇女骨干，其数量是超过以往几倍以至几十倍之多。但另一方面，由于人民公社是又大又公的组织，领导骨干的任务繁多，责任重大。城市街道居民工作中，过去绝大多数干部都是由妇女担任的，现在随着城市建设的发展，广大家庭妇女转入社会劳动，原有的女骨干对于领导生产和组织集体生活的经验比较缺乏。在这个新的历史任务面前，有意识有计划地培养女骨干参与生产和生活组织的领导工作，对于发挥广大妇女群众的积极性有着极为重要的作用。现在全国许多省、市、县、人民公社坚持执行了中央关于“社社有女社长，队队有女队长”的指示，在人民公社正副社长，生产大队（耕作区）及生产队的正副队长中，都有一定数量的女干部。但也有些人民公社还没有在各层领导机构中注意配备女骨干，希望有关领导方面，结合整社和备耕运动，及早地有计划有意识地培养和提拔妇女骨干，参与人民公社各层领导。在有大量妇女参加的国营厂矿、商店等企业、服务性事业中也同样需要加强对妇女骨干的培养。而我们妇女干部本身更应该在工作中互相帮助、互相学习，努力提高政治、业务及生产技术水平，名副其实地完成党和群众交给我们的光荣任务。
      注意保护妇女身体健康，以保持持久
  的旺盛干劲
    第五，当这新的生产高潮正在全国各地开展，各个战线上的妇女正在紧张热烈地进行忘我劳动的时候，为了保持持久的旺盛的干劲，我们妇女在发挥高度的生产积极性的同时，必须注意保护身体健康。从党的八届六中全会决议公布以后，各地都在原有的基础上更进一步注意保护妇女劳动力，许多地方做到了“一定要保证妇女在产前产后的充分的休息，在月经期内也一定要让妇女得到必要的休息，不做重活，不下冷水，不熬夜”。凡是这样做的地方，妇女生产劳动的积极性更加提高，生产任务也完成得更好，妇女的身体健康也相应增长；所以不论从长远的利益和眼前的利益来看，发挥妇女劳动积极性和保护妇女身体健康是一致的，并不矛盾。我们妇女，要自觉地注意执行。同时还要向有关各方面进行宣传。对于保护妇女劳动有抵触思想的人，要耐心地进行解释。
    1959年，我国妇女在争取国内社会主义建设更大更好更全面跃进的同时，要为保卫世界和平贡献更大的力量。以苏联为首的各兄弟国家社会主义建设事业的空前跃进，尤其苏联伟大的国民经济七年计划的光辉更鼓舞着我们建设的信心；同时亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的民族独立运动正波澜壮阔地迅速朝前发展，而以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的经济危机和相互矛盾正在日益加深，整个的国际形势完全证明：东风已经压倒西风并将继续进一步压倒西风，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。在这个完全有利于我们建设的国际形势下，我国妇女要更加努力，以建设的成绩，增强保卫世界和平的力量；要热烈响应国际民主妇女联合会执行局发出的告世界妇女书，为停止核武器试验、禁止一切核武器、要求裁减军备而努力；还需要更好地加强同以苏联为首的各社会主义国家妇女的团结互助，虚心地永远地学习她们建设的先进经验；努力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国的民族解放斗争；要更好地发展同世界各国爱好和平妇女的友好合作；以便和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，争取世界和平和人类进步事业的更大胜利！　　（题目是本报编者加的）（附图片）
