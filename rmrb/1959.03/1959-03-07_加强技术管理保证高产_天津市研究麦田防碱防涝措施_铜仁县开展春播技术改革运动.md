    Strengthen Technical Management to Ensure High Yields
    Tianjin Studies Measures for Alkali and Flood Prevention in Wheat Fields
    Tongren County Launches Spring Sowing Technical Reform Movement
    This newspaper, Tianjin, 6th – The Rural Work Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently sent people to investigate the growth of wheat in saline-alkali, water-adjacent, and river bend areas. The investigation found that some wheat seedlings in these areas were yellowing, and wheat fields in low-lying areas were being leached and damaged by alkali.
    This investigation conducted a careful study of the problems in wheat seedling growth, and based on local conditions and existing experience, determined appropriate technical measures. For example, in Ba County, within three miles of the reservoir area, wheat fields are being leached by water. Some have groundwater close to the surface, and others have groundwater levels above one foot, but the soil moisture is too high, preventing wheat seedlings from growing normally. The solutions for these areas are: dig deep intercepting ditches one to two meters deep along the edge of the water to prevent leaching; if there are drainage conditions, combine this with terraced field projects to dig drainage ditches and lower the groundwater level. For wheat fields with excessive humidity, multiple harrowing and cultivation can be used to loosen the soil, circulate air, and reduce soil moisture content. For wheat fields that have been submerged and cannot be drained, transplanting seedlings can be used as a remedy.
    The investigation also found that some wheat seedlings were showing signs of yellowing. After discussions and analysis with the masses, it was determined that the basic reason for the yellowing was a lack of fertilizer. Secondly, some cases were due to sowing too early, too high of a sowing density, too deep of a sowing depth, or too thick of a soil covering, resulting in a long germination and emergence time for the seeds and excessive nutrient consumption. These fields need to be vigorously top-dressed with well-rotted human manure and urine, ammonium sulfate, and other fast-acting fertilizers. In conjunction with top-dressing, these wheat fields should also be watered appropriately early for spring recovery.
    This year, Tianjin has planted more than 8 million mu of winter wheat, a large proportion of which is in saline-alkali and low-lying areas. This investigation will greatly help to strengthen the management of these fields and promote increased production. (Zhang Hua)
    This newspaper, Guiyang, 6th – Tongren County, Guizhou, based on summarizing the spring sowing technical experience of last year, has launched a mass spring sowing technical reform movement.
    In mid-February, the more than 50,000 mu of spring potatoes sown in the county were not only selected, deeply ploughed, and had base fertilizer applied in layers before sowing, but also took frost and rot prevention measures. The 2,500 mu of early corn that has been sown generally undergoes warm bed seedling cultivation and cattle manure germination acceleration before being transplanted into the ground after the seeds sprout. In order to ensure that sweet potatoes have a long period of warm growth and to increase the size of the tubers, rapid warm bed seedling cultivation of sweet potatoes (commonly known as "fire sweet potato seedlings") is being promoted this year. Currently, the sweet potato seedlings cultivated throughout the county account for more than half of the planned planting volume, more than a month earlier than last year. Among them, 75% have emerged from the soil, and the seedlings are growing strong and vigorous.
    In order to achieve the county's plan to double grain production, the county, led by the thirteen scientific research institutes of each commune, management area, and production team, as well as hundreds of technical training stations and technical popularization groups, mobilized the broad masses of commune members to carefully summarize the local planting experience of rice, corn, sweet potatoes, and other crops last year, and combined it with foreign experience to formulate spring sowing technical operating procedures for the main crops of each commune.
    The Tongren County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the spring sowing technical reform work. Yao Hongxian, the county party secretary, often goes deep into the communes to personally check on the spring sowing technical reform issues. The party secretaries of each commune also personally lead this movement. (Liu Yangshen)

    加强技术管理保证高产
    天津市研究麦田防碱防涝措施
    铜仁县开展春播技术改革运动
    本报天津6日电　中共天津市委农村工作委员会，最近派人分别对盐碱、临水、河套等地区的小麦生长情况进行了调查，发现这些地区的部分麦苗黄萎、低洼地区麦田浸淘和遭受碱害。
    这次调查对麦苗生长中的问题，进行了认真的研究，并根据当地条件和已有经验，确定了相当的技术措施。例如坝县临近蓄水区三里地以内的麦田，受水浸淘，有的地下水临近地面，有的地下水位虽在一尺以上，但土壤水份过大，使麦苗不能正常生长。对这些地区麦田的处理办法是：在临水边沿开挖深达一两公尺的截渗沟，防止浸淘；有排水条件的，应结合搞畦田工程，挖好排水沟，降低地下水。对湿度过大的麦田，可以采取多耙地、多中耕，以达到松土、流通空气，降低土壤含水量的目的。对已经被水没顶而无法排水的麦地，可以采取移苗的办法补救。
    调查中还发现部分麦苗发生黄萎现象，经过与群众座谈分析，苗黄的基本原因是缺少肥料。其次，有的是因为播种太早，下种量过大，播种深，复土厚，种子萌芽出土时间长，养分消耗过多等等原因。这些田需要大力追施腐熟的人粪尿、硫铵等速效性的肥料。结合追肥，这些麦田还要适当早浇返青水。
    天津地区今年种植冬小麦八百多万亩，其中盐碱地低洼地占很大比例。这次调查对加强这些田的管理，促进增产有很大作用。（张华）
    本报贵阳6日电　贵州铜仁县在总结去年春播技术经验的基础上，掀起了一个群众性的春播技术改革运动。
    2月中旬，全县播种的五万多亩春洋芋，播种前不仅全部经过选种、深耕、分层施底肥，还采取了防冻防烂措施。已播下的二千五百亩早玉米，一般经过温床育苗，牛粪催芽，待种子露芽后才移栽到地里。为了保证红薯有长时期的温暖生长期，使薯块增大，今年全部推广红薯快速温床育苗（俗称火苕秧），目前全县培育的薯秧已占计划播种量的一半多，比去年提早一个多月，其中75％已经出土，薯苗长得壮旺。
    为实现全县粮食产量加番的计划，全县以各公社、管理区、生产队的十三个科学研究所，以及成百上千个技术传授站、技术普及小组为主，发动广大社员，认真总结了当地去年水稻、玉米、红苕等作物的播种经验，并结合外地经验制订出各公社主要农作物春播技术操作规程。
    中共铜仁县委十分重视春播技术改革工作。县委书记姚洪显常深入公社，亲自检查春播技术改革问题。各公社党委书记也都亲自领导这个运动。　　　　（刘扬深）
