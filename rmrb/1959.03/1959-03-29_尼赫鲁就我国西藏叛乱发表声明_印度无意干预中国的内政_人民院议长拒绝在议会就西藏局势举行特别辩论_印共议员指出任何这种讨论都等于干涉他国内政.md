Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, New Delhi Dispatch: According to Indian News Service telecommunications from New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement in the People's Assembly on March 23 regarding the situation in the Tibet region of China. Nehru said, "The recent news about the events that have occurred in the Tibet region of China has naturally aroused great attention in our country." He said, "Last week, on March 17, during the discussion of the demands put forward by the Ministry of External Affairs, I briefly mentioned the tensions there. I mentioned that there had been a conflict of intentions, although there have been no major violent actions recently."

Nehru was referring to his speech in the People's Assembly on March 17, in which he "expressed concern" about the situation in the Tibet region of China.

Nehru continued, "Later, we received more detailed information from our Consul-General in Lhasa. It seems that various rumors about the Dalai Lama have caused agitation in Lhasa. About two weeks ago, a large number of Tibetans entered the Indian Consulate-General. They talked to our Consul-General about these rumors and their unease. Three days later, many Tibetan women came to our Consulate-General, asking our Consul-General to accompany them to the Chinese Foreign Affairs Office to witness them making certain demands." Nehru said that the Indian Consul-General explained to these women that he could not accompany them.

Nehru spoke of "the sudden outbreak of fighting between Chinese troops and Tibetan elements" on March 20. Some stray bullets hit the Indian Consulate-General, but personnel and property were not damaged. He said, "Obviously, the situation in Lhasa has calmed down somewhat." Nehru said, "The People's Assembly will understand that this is a difficult and delicate situation, and we should avoid taking any actions that would aggravate this situation. We have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs, and we have friendly relations with China. The Sino-Indian Agreement was signed in 1954 (referring to the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and India). The Panchsheel Principles were first stipulated in this agreement."

According to foreign news agencies, before and after Nehru issued his statement, some members of the People's Assembly, especially members of the People's Socialist Party, requested a special debate on the situation in Tibet, China. Communist Party member Dange opposed such a discussion, saying that any such discussion would amount to interference in the internal affairs of another country. If Beijing were to discuss Singh's arrest or discuss the threat of civil war over land reform in India, many protests would be raised.

Nehru said that things happening in another country may sometimes have some relevance, so these things are often mentioned in foreign affairs debates. However, holding a special debate would have far-reaching consequences and set a bad precedent.

Speaker Ayyangar refused to hold a special debate. He said, "We have the friendliest relations with China. This House never discusses the internal affairs of other countries." He added, "Some people have argued that if the fighting continues, a large number of people may come to the border. If they come, then we will study this issue."

    尼赫鲁就我国西藏叛乱发表声明
    印度无意干预中国的内政
    人民院议长拒绝在议会就西藏局势举行特别辩论
    印共议员指出任何这种讨论都等于干涉他国内政
    新华社28日讯　据印度新闻处新德里电讯，印度总理尼赫鲁3月23日在人民院就中国西藏地区局势发表声明。尼赫鲁说，“最近关于中国西藏地区所发生的事件的消息自然在我国引起很大的注意。”他说，“上星期在3月17日，在讨论为外交部提出的要求的过程中，我简略地提到那里的紧张局势。我提到曾发生意愿方面的冲突，虽然最近并没有发生重大的暴力行动。”
    尼赫鲁指的是他3月17日在人民院的讲话，在那次讲话中他对中国西藏地区的局势“表示关切”。
    尼赫鲁接着说，“后来我们从我们驻拉萨的总领事那里收到较详细的情报。看来关于达赖喇嘛的各种谣言在拉萨引起了激动情绪。在大约两周以前，有一大批西藏人进入了印度总领事馆。他们向我们的总领事谈到这些谣言和他们感到的不安。三天以后，有许多西藏妇女到我们的总领事馆来，要求我们的总领事陪她们到中国外事处，为她们提出某些要求作见证。”尼赫鲁说，印度总领事对这些妇女说明不能陪她们去。
    尼赫鲁谈到3月20日“中国军队和西藏分子之间突然爆发了战斗”。印度总领事馆中了一些流弹，但人员和财产均未受到损失。他说，“显然，拉萨的局势已经平静了一些”。尼赫鲁说，“人民院将了解，这是一个困难而微妙的局势，我们应当避免采取任何会使这个局势恶化的行动。我们无意干预中国的内政，我们同中国有友好的关系。在1954年签订了中印协定（按指中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间通商和交通协定）。潘查希拉原则就是在这个协定中第一次规定下来的。”
    据外国通讯社报道，在尼赫鲁发表声明之前和以后，人民院的一些议员，特别是人民社会党的议员要求就中国的西藏局势问题举行特别辩论。共产党议员丹吉反对举行这样的讨论，他说，任何这样的讨论都等于干涉他国的内政。如果北京要讨论辛格被捕或讨论关于印度土地改革的内战威胁，那就会提出许多抗议。
    尼赫鲁说，另一个国家中发生的事情有时可能有些关系，因此在外交辩论中常提到这些事情。但是举行特别辩论将具有影响深远的后果，并且树立不好的先例。
    议长阿延加尔拒绝举行特别辩论。他说，我们同中国有最友好的关系。本院从来不讨论他国的内政问题。他又说，有人提出论点说，如果战斗发展下去，就可能有大批人来到边境。“如果他们来了，那时我们再研究这个问题。”
