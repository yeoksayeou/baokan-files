When is Broadcast Sound Most Clear?
	Zhang Lin

	The radio waves emitted from the antenna of a radio station carry sound waves, like people riding in an airplane, flying in all directions. Radio waves can generally be divided into two parts: sky waves and ground waves. Ground waves propagate along the ground. Their propagation distance is affected by weather and geographical conditions. They travel farther on flat ground than in mountainous areas, farther in rural areas than in cities, and farther over the sea than over land. This is mainly because ground waves are gradually absorbed by ground objects during propagation. Sky waves, however, are not restricted by these conditions. They can immediately penetrate to a height of two to three hundred kilometers above the ground. There, it is like a huge mirror is placed, and some sky waves are immediately reflected back, just like light rays hitting a mirror. Therefore, radios on the ground can receive programs from distant stations. This layer of "mirror" that can reflect radio waves is called the ionosphere.

	The shortwave broadcasting band is particularly suitable for long-distance broadcasting, fax, and communication because its sky waves are reflected by the ionosphere. As long as the area reached by the reflected wave can receive the signal, but because the reflected wave is in the shape of a parabolic curve, there is often a "skip distance" in the middle that cannot be received. Generally, the shorter the wavelength, the farther the skip. Therefore, the same shortwave radio can receive different radio stations in different locations. A certain Moscow radio station can be heard in Wuhan, but may not be heard in Xinjiang.

	The ionosphere is created at a very high altitude due to the low air pressure, and the ionization of the air by ultraviolet rays and cosmic rays from the sun. When the intensity of sunlight changes, the height and thickness of the ionosphere will also change, so the reflection of shortwave sky waves will be affected. In winter, the sunlight is weak, the ionosphere is thin and far from the ground, so the receiving distance can be longer and clearer. In summer, the sunlight is strong and unstable, the ionosphere is thick and low, and it often changes, so the radio reception is not clear. As for the evening, although sunlight does not directly shine, the ionosphere still exists, but some ions dissipate by themselves, and the ionosphere is weaker than during the day and higher above the ground, so it is also more stable. Therefore, shortwave reception is better at night than during the day, and better in winter than in summer. The sky waves in the medium wave broadcasting band are mostly absorbed by the ionosphere during the day. Only when the density of the ionosphere changes at night can the sky waves in the medium wave band be reflected satisfactorily, so that distant medium wave broadcasts can be received more ideally.

    广播之声何时最清楚？
    张林
    从广播电台的天线发出来的无线电波，载着声波，好像人搭乘了飞机一样，飞向四方。无线电波一般可以分为两部分：天波和地波。地波是沿着地面传播的。它的传播距离受着天时地理条件的影响，在平坦的地面上，比山岳地区传得远，乡村比城市传得远，海面上又比陆地上传得远。这主要因为地波在传播过程中逐渐被地面物体吸收了。天波却不受这些条件的限制，一下子可以穿射到离地面二、三百公里的高空，在那里好像放着一面巨大的镜子，有些天波就像光线碰到镜子一样，立时就被反射回来，因此地面上的收音机就可以收到远方电台的节目。这一层能反射电波的“镜子”，我们把它叫做电离层。
    短波广播波段，特别适宜于远距离广播、传真和通讯，就是由于它的天波被电离层所反射的缘故。只要反射波所能达到的区域就能收到讯号，但由于反射波呈抛物曲线形，往往中间隔开了一段不能收听的“跳越距离”。通常波长愈短，跳越愈远。因此同样的短波收音机，在不同的地点所能收听的电台是不相同的，在武汉可以收听莫斯科的某一电台，到新疆可能就听不见了。
    电离层是在很高的高空中，由于气压低，太阳光的紫外线和宇宙射线使空气产生电离作用而造成的。太阳光强度变化时，电离层的高低、厚薄亦会变化，因此短波的天波反射就要受到影响，冬季阳光弱，电离层薄，离地面远，收听距离可以较远，而且较清晰。夏季阳光强而不稳定，电离层厚而低，且常变动，收音就不清晰。至于晚间阳光虽不直接照射，但电离层仍然存在，只是部分离子自行消散，电离层比白天变弱些，离地也高些，因此也较稳定些，所以收听短波晚间比白昼好，冬季比夏季好。中波广播波段的天波，在白天大都被电离层所吸收，只有在晚上电离层密度变化了，中波段的天波才能得到满意的反射，这才可以较理想的收到远地的中波广播。
