Field "Advisors"
By Our Correspondent Liang Guangjing

In Xinglong People's Commune, Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, most production teams have "advisors" in the wheat production campaign. These field advisors are commune members with production experience and progressive thinking, elected by the masses.

In early February, when wheat seedlings in most areas had not yet turned green, the more than 20,000 mu of wheat in this commune were already full of spring color. The good ones already had five or six leaves, and the slightly worse ones had three leaves. The wheat fields were carefully managed everywhere, with plenty of fertilizer and sufficient water. There was not a single field of third-class seedlings to be seen.

When this reporter visited the Fifth Production Team of the Fourth Brigade, Deputy Captain Lu Zhaofu told me that the field advisors have played a significant role in wheat field management. This production team has more than ninety field advisors for over four hundred mu of wheat fields. The responsibilities of the field advisors are: to manage the growth of wheat seedlings, ensure full seedlings, large ears, and many grains to achieve the thousand-jin target; to manage the quality of agricultural work; to manage the smooth flow of irrigation ditches to ensure dry fields after rain; to manage the inspection of pests and diseases; and to prevent children, chickens, ducks, cattle, and horses from trampling the wheat seedlings in the fields.

Field advisors have already had a significant effect on field management. Young woman Yang Guifang is the field advisor for field number eleven on the Twenty-first Embankment of the Fifth Production Team. When she took charge of managing this wheat field in mid-January, she found that more than one mu of wheat seedlings were not growing very well. She immediately suggested to labor group leader Liu Deguang to apply pig manure fertilizer to this field. Now the wheat seedlings in this field are growing very uniformly. When this reporter visited this female commune member, she said that she always takes time to look at the field she is responsible for several times a day, and it is also her glory that this field can achieve a yield of one thousand jin per mu!

I also met several other field advisors, who said, "With responsibility fields, everyone can show their talents." They all try to make the wheat seedlings they manage grow better than the wheat seedlings in the fields on the left and right. Liu Derong, who is responsible for field number three on the Twenty-first Embankment, used to go wherever he was told to work before becoming a field advisor, and his work was very passive. But after becoming a field advisor, his sense of responsibility increased. He carefully studied the growth of the wheat seedlings in the field he was responsible for and achieved fertilization based on the condition of the seedlings. Now the field he manages basically has one seedling and one ear, with forty to sixty grains per ear, and it is estimated that it can reach a yield of one thousand three hundred jin per mu. When one field is well managed, everyone immediately learns from each other, and a mass competition to show their talents is formed. Now that every field has an advisor, production team cadres can specialize and fixedly participate in labor in one group. A quick meeting of the team cadres can provide an understanding of the growth of wheat seedlings throughout the team. Having advisors in every field is not just a simple responsibility system, but also a mass line in field management. Facts have proven that this approach has stimulated the enthusiasm and responsibility of the masses, and has found the most reliable guarantee for this year's small-scale high yield.

### 田间“参谋”

    田间“参谋”
    本报记者　梁光景
    江苏省扬中县兴隆人民公社在三麦千斤运动中，多数生产队块块田间有“参谋”。这些田间参谋，是由群众推选出来的有生产经验和思想进步的社员。
    2月初，一般地区麦苗还未返青的时候，这个公社的两万多亩三麦已经是满田春色，好的已有五、六个叶子，稍差一点的也有三个叶子。到处麦田管理得细致，肥多水也足，不见一块三类苗。
    记者在四大队第五生产队访问时，副队长陆朝富对我说，田间参谋在麦田管理工作上发挥了很大作用。这个生产队四百多亩麦田就有九十多名田间参谋。田间参谋的职责是：管麦苗生长情况，保证苗全、穗大、粒多，达到千斤指标；管农活质量；管水沟通畅，保证雨住田干；管检查病虫害；管小孩、鸡鸭、牛马不到田间蹧蹋麦苗。
    田间参谋在田间管理工作上，已经有了显著效果。青年妇女杨桂芳，是第五生产队二十一圩上?十一号田的田间参谋。当她在1月中旬负责管理这块麦田时，发现有一亩多麦苗长得不大好，她马上向劳动组长刘德广建议，在这亩田加施猪灰肥，现在这块田麦苗长得很整齐。记者访问这位女社员时，她说对自己负责管的田，每天总要抽空去望几遍，这块田能实现亩产千斤，也是自己的光荣呵！
    我还遇见好几位田间参谋，他们说：“有了责任田，就可以各显神通”。他们都想方设法使自己所管的麦苗，要比左右邻近田的麦苗长得好。负责二十一圩上?三号田的刘德荣，在未担任田间参谋以前，喊到哪里去做活，就到哪里去，工作被动得很。但是当了田间参谋之后，他的责任心增强了。他精心研究自己负责的田麦苗生长情况，做到了看苗下肥，现在他管的这块田基本上是一苗一穗，每穗有四十到六十粒籽，估计能达到亩产一千三百斤。哪一块田管得好，立即就互相学习，而且形成群众性的各显神通的竞赛。现在块块田头有参谋，生产队干部就能够分工固定地深入在一个组内参加劳动。队干部开一次碰头会议，就可以了解全队麦苗的生长情况。块块田头有参谋，这不仅是简单的责任制问题，而且是田间管理工作上的群众路线。事实证明，这种作法已经激发了群众的积极性和责任心，使今年小产丰产找到了最可靠的保证。（附图片）
