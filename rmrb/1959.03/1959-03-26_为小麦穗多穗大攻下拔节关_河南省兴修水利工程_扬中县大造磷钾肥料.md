Xinhua News Agency report: Henan wheat is growing vigorously and densely, generally over a foot tall, with jointing occurring earlier than in previous years. In order to irrigate the jointing stage in a timely manner and prepare for the sowing of over 30 million mu of major autumn crops, various parts of Henan Province are launching a vigorous high tide of water conservancy activities, focusing on the repair of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects and field projects.

Across the province, 2.5 million people are participating in this movement daily. Preliminary statistics as of March 20th show that the province has repaired over 237,000 various small channels, over 7,500 small reservoirs, over 30,000 ponds and dams, dug 7,000 wells, and opened over 14,000 artesian springs.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the current concentrated water conservancy campaign. Four secretaries of the CCP Zhenping County Committee are leading water conservancy projects in the Zhao River, Yanling River, Qi River, and Liao River basins. In the Kaifeng Special District, every canal has a leader, and every well has a dedicated person responsible. Many areas have also launched red flag competitions between teams and individuals.

(Our newspaper Yangzhong, March 25th dispatch) The people of Yangzhong County, Jiangsu, are launching a crash program to accumulate and produce phosphorus and potassium fertilizers on a large scale, providing ample nutrition to the wheat seedlings during the jointing and ear-bearing stages.

Currently, as the weather warms up, Yangzhong County's wheat seedlings have entered the round stem jointing and ear-bearing period. At this time, to consolidate the tillers that have already jointed and promote the full development of young ears, a large amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer is needed. In particular, the number of seedlings per mu this year is about three times higher than in previous years, and to make each ear large and each grain full, several times more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer is needed than in previous years. After analyzing this situation, the CCP Yangzhong County Committee believed that relying solely on chemical fertilizers could not meet the needs of the three wheat crops for phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, so it was necessary to launch a mass movement to accumulate and produce phosphorus and potassium fertilizer on a large scale.

Starting in mid-February, the county committee publicized the importance of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer for long ears and long grains to cadres and the masses, while leading the masses to find sources of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. Zhu Songhua and Xu Jing, deputy secretaries of the county committee, and the party secretaries of each commune, went deep into the communes, teams, and with the masses to identify a variety of fertilizer sources.

Yangzhong County is surrounded by rivers on all four sides, with crisscrossing ditches and ponds full of snails and river mussels. They made full use of this favorable condition, using these aquatic animals as an inexhaustible source of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. They put forward the slogan "Accumulate enough phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to feed the three wheat fields fully," and launched a mass movement to harvest snails throughout the county. The commune party secretaries and the brigade and team cadres, each with a net, led the masses to fish in ditches, ponds, and rivers everywhere. In nearly a month, the communes harvested more than 36,000 dan of snails.

In the movement to vigorously produce phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, more than 1,200 local fertilizer plants and more than 29,000 various forms of smoked soil kilns throughout the county emitted thick smoke day and night. The local fertilizer is made from smoked soil, human urine, cow dung, bone meal, snail powder, and other raw materials, to produce a refined fertilizer with a high phosphorus and potassium content. In the fertilizer production process, each commune organized various specialized teams to carry out smoked soil, snail harvesting, snail processing, and other work separately. Communes such as Youfang and Fengyu also organized commercial workers in the towns to participate in the production of local fertilizer. Each factory set tasks by factory and targets by person, clearly dividing labor and working day and night without stopping. Each commune adopted the method of accumulating and applying fertilizer simultaneously, applying the accumulated phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner. From March 1st to 20th, the average amount of fertilizer applied throughout the county was 128 dan per mu. For first-class seedlings that are thick and strong, snail paste and potassium-rich smoked soil are generally applied to promote stronger growth and harder wheat stalks. For the few denser seedlings, wood ash containing a large amount of potassium and finely screened smoked soil are applied to prevent lodging due to weak stalks. For second and third-class seedlings, quick-acting fertilizers such as snail paste and human manure and pig ash are vigorously applied to promote faster growth.

    为小麦穗多穗大攻下拔节关
    河南省兴修水利工程　扬中县大造磷钾肥料
    据新华社讯　河南小麦茁壮茂密，一般已长有一尺多高，拔节比往年提早。为了及时灌溉拔节水，并迎接三千多万亩大秋作物的播种，河南省各地正在展开一个声势浩大的以整修中小型水利工程和田间工程为主的水利运动高潮。
    全省每天投入这个运动的有二百五十万人。到3月20日的初步统计，全省已整修各种小型渠道二十三万七千多条，小水库七千五百多座，塘堰坝三万多处，打井七千眼，开挖下泉一万四千多眼。
    各级党委十分重视当前的突击整修水利运动。中共镇平县委四个书记，分片领导赵河、沿陵河、淇河、潦河流域的水利工程。开封专区水利工程做到了渠渠有领导，井井有专人负责。很多地区并展开了队与队、人与人的红旗竞赛。
    本报扬中25日电　江苏扬中县人民，正在突击大积、大造磷钾肥，给拔节孕穗的麦苗以充足的营养。
    目前气候转暖，扬中县的麦苗已进入圆秆拔节孕穗时期。这个时候，要巩固已经拔节的分蘖，促进幼穗的充分发育，需要大量的磷钾肥料。特别是今年的麦苗每亩苗数比往年增加三倍左右，要使穗穗长大、粒粒饱满，就需要比往年多好几倍的磷钾肥料。中共扬中县委分析了这一情况后，认为单纯依靠化学肥料是不能解决三麦对磷钾肥的需要，因此必须展开一个群众性的大积大造磷钾肥的运动。
    2月中旬开始，县委向干部和群众宣传磷钾肥对三麦长穗长粒的重要意义，同时带领群众寻找磷钾肥源。县委副书记朱松华、徐靖和各公社党委书记都深入社、队和群众一起找出了多种肥源。
    扬中县四面临江，境内沟渠纵横，池塘遍布，螺丝、河蚌很多。他们充分利用这个有利条件，把这些水生动物作为取之不尽的磷钾肥料的肥源。他们提出了“积足磷钾肥，喂饱三麦田”的口号，在全县范围内掀起了一个大捞螺丝的群众性的运动。公社的党委书记们和大队、小队的干部人手一网，带领群众在各处沟、塘、河道上捕捞。近一个月中，各公社捞到螺丝三万六千多担。
    在大搞磷钾肥料的运动中，全县一千二百多个土化肥厂和二万九千多座各种形式的熏土窑日夜冒着浓烟。土化肥是以熏土、人尿、牛屎、骨粉、螺丝粉等为原料，制成一种含磷钾量很高的精肥。制肥中各公社组织了各种专业队伍，分别进行熏土、捞螺丝、加工螺丝等工作。油坊、丰裕等公社还组织集镇上的商业工作人员参加土化肥的生产。各厂都以厂定任务，以人定指标，明确分工，歇人不歇工地日夜生产。各公社采取边积边施的方法，把积造起来的大量磷钾肥及时追施到田里。从3月1日到20日，全县追施的肥料平均每亩一百二十八担。对苗粗苗壮的一类苗，普遍加施磷钾俱全的螺丝糊和钾肥熏土，促使它越长越健旺，麦秆越长越硬。对少数较密的苗，施上含有大量钾素的草木灰和筛细的熏土，防止因秸茎软弱而倒伏。对二三类苗猛追螺丝糊和人粪、猪灰等速效肥料，促使它加快生长。
