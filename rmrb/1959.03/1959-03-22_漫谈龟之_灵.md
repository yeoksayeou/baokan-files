    A Casual Discussion on the "Spirituality" of Turtles
    Yang Min
    The turtle, one of the so-called "Four Spirits" in ancient China, is the most familiar to people. Simply because ancient people had limited knowledge and could not understand the turtle's life characteristics and other strange phenomena, they regarded it as a mysterious thing.
    The turtle's carapace and plastron are both formed by epidermal keratinization and dermal ossification. Like amorphous substances such as glass, when subjected to destructive forces, they often fracture in different directions. The ancients did not understand this point and blindly believed in "turtle divination."
    Turtles are cold-blooded animals, and their shells easily dissipate heat. When it is about to rain, excessive water vapor in the air will condense on the turtle's back. This is the same principle as "damp foundations indicate rain," and it is not because the turtle has any foresight.
    Legend has it that turtles "do not drink or eat," but in reality, turtles can only endure hunger and thirst for a relatively long time, not that they absolutely do not eat. Many turtles are herbivorous, and remnants of roots and leaves can sustain life. When there is little food, they eat just enough to stave off hunger; when there is plenty of food, they eat heartily, seemingly without a limit. However, when they eat a lot, most of the excess nutrients are stored in the liver and other tissues for use during hibernation or food shortages. Moreover, during hibernation or food shortages, their metabolism is significantly weakened, consuming less than usual. Even more interesting is that there is a large sac on each side of the cloaca, which can store a large amount of water and keep it fresh and palatable, even better than a camel's water sac. It is said that people traveling in the tropics have cut open turtle sacs to extract its water to quench their thirst. As for the turtles themselves, in addition to being able to use the oxygen dissolved in this sac water to supplement their breathing and to moisten the sand when laying eggs and digging holes, they can also use it to quench their thirst when necessary. In addition, turtles generally do not need much water, and some can even get enough water from the food they eat.
    Legends also record that turtles "can guide and induce qi" and that "large turtles open their mouths to draw in qi, either bowing or raising their heads." This situation is indeed true. Because turtles do not have intercostal muscles, they must use the rise and fall of the lower part of their mouths to first suck air into the mouth and then press it into the lungs when breathing, which looks like swallowing food. In addition, the stretching and retracting of the head and feet cause the lungs to expand and contract, which is indeed a breathing action. It is said that the current qigong, sports, and other therapies, formerly collectively known as "guiding," were invented by imitating the special movements of turtles and other animals. It can be seen that the ancient saying that turtles live long is due to guiding and moving qi has some truth. However, it is now believed that the longevity of turtles is also related to the fact that their lungs are particularly developed, capable of holding a large amount of air, and their long-term hibernation.
    Ancient people regarded turtles as spiritual beings. However, in later generations, they were regarded as representatives of ugliness and lowness. This is somewhat of an underestimation. You should know that although turtles are not spiritual beings, their value is indeed not small.
    In ancient times, turtle shells were used as currency. Before the Qin and Han dynasties, before paper was invented, things that needed to be recorded were mainly carved on turtle shells or animal bones with knives, forming the so-called "oracle bone script." These turtle shells inscribed with writing were discovered in the Ruins of Yin, and there are no fewer than tens of thousands of recorded pieces. It can be seen that turtle shells have made a certain contribution to the evolution of writing. As for using turtle shells to make combs, buttons, smoking sets... and other decorations, it is even more common.
    In modern times, the use of turtle shells to make various handicrafts is even more widespread; and it has been discovered that turtle bones and shells are a very good phosphate fertilizer. The commonly known turtle is a type of freshwater turtle, and the soft-shelled turtle (commonly known as round fish, turtle) is also one of the freshwater turtles; the meat and blood of these two types of turtles and the green sea turtle, etc., among the saltwater turtles, can be eaten. In particular, the meat of soft-shelled turtles and green sea turtles tastes very good and is rich in nutrition. Although the meat of loggerhead turtles, hawksbill turtles, and tortoiseshells among saltwater turtles is too smelly to eat, the fat is very rich and can be used to extract oil, which can be used to make soap, etc. The eggs of various turtles can also be eaten. Especially sea turtles, one turtle lays about two hundred eggs a year, which is a considerable amount of supplementary food. In addition, turtle shells and the claw skin of the four feet can also be boiled into glue, which is very valuable in medicine and industry.
    My country is very rich in both saltwater and freshwater turtles. In Shanghai alone, the transaction volume of soft-shelled turtles alone reached more than 350,000 catties in 1950. In 1957, a resource survey team from the Guangdong Aquatic Products Bureau captured more than 600 sea turtles (each weighing about 200 catties) between the Xisha Islands. This was done under incidental conditions and with simple tools.

    漫谈龟之“灵”
    杨旻
    我国古代所谓“四灵”中的龟，是人们最熟悉的。只因古人知识有限，对于龟的生活特性及其他奇异现象不能理解，才把它看成为一种神秘的东西。
    龟的背甲和腹甲，都是由表皮角质化和真皮骨质化而成。它和玻璃等非晶体一样，在受到破坏作用的时候，往往会沿着不同的方向发生破裂。古人不明白这一点，迷信“龟卜”。
    龟是冷血动物，龟甲又容易散热，天将下雨的时候，空气中过多的水蒸气便会在龟背上凝结。这和“础润而雨”的道理相同，并不是龟有什么预见。
    传说谓龟“不饮不食”，实际上龟类不过能较长久地耐饥渴而已，并非绝对不食。龟类中很多都是草食，残根败叶，便可维持生活。食物少，聊以充饥；食物多，则大吃而特吃，似乎没有个饱。不过吃得多的时候，大部分多余的养分都被贮藏到肝脏和其他组织里面，以备蛰伏或缺食时应用。并且在蛰伏或缺食的时候，它们的新陈代谢又显著减弱，消耗较平时少。更有趣的是泄殖腔两旁各有一个大囊室，既可贮蓄多量水分，又能保持清冽可口，比骆驼的水囊还要出色。据说在热带地方旅行的人，就有剖龟开囊，取出它的水分来解渴的。而龟类自己，除能利用这囊水中溶解的氧，以补呼吸的不足和产卵挖穴时用它湿润沙土以外，必要时也可用它来解渴。此外，龟类需水一般都不多，有些甚至只要利用食物中所含的水分就已足够。
    传说又有“龟能导引致气”，以及“大龟张口引气，或俯或仰”等记载。这情形倒是真实的。因为龟没有肋间肌，呼吸时，必须利用口腔下部的一降一升，把空气先吸入口腔，然后再压送到肺中去，看起来就和咽吞食物一样。此外，头、足一伸一缩，肺便一张一收，也确是一种呼吸动作。据说现在的气功、体育等疗法，在从前统称为“导引”就是模仿龟类及其他动物的特殊动作而发明的。可见古代说龟多寿，是由于导引行气所致，也有些道理。不过龟的多寿，现在认为还和龟的肺特别发达，能容纳多量空气，以及长期蛰伏等有关。
    古人把龟当作灵物。然而到了后世，却把它当成了丑恶和低贱的代表。这又未免轻视过甚。要知道，龟虽不是灵物，但是它的价值实在不小。
    在古代，龟甲曾用来当货币。秦汉以前，纸张尚未发明，需要记载的事物，主要是用刀刻于龟甲或兽骨上，而形成所谓“甲骨文”。这种刻有文字的龟板，发现于殷墟，而见于记载的，不下数万。可见龟甲对于文字的演进，是有一定功劳的。至于用龟甲制造梳子、钮扣、烟具……及其他装饰品，就更普遍了。
    在现代，用龟甲制作各种工艺品，更加普遍；并发现龟的骨、甲，是一种很好的磷肥。普通所说的乌龟是一种淡水龟，鳖（俗称团鱼、甲鱼）也是淡水龟之一；这两种龟和咸水龟中的绿?龟等的肉、血都可以食用。特别是鳖和绿?龟的肉，滋味都很好，并且富于营养。咸水龟中的棱龟、红?龟、玳瑁的肉虽因臭不堪食，但脂肪非常丰富，可用以熬油，可作制造肥皂等用。各种龟的卵也都可以吃。尤其是海龟，一只龟一年所产的卵，约有二百左右，实在是一项相当丰富的副食品。此外，龟板和四足的爪皮还可以熬胶，在医药上和工业上都很有价值。
    我国咸水龟和淡水龟都非常丰富。仅上海一市，单鳖鱼一项，在1950年的交易数量，就达三十五万多斤。1957年，广东水产厅一个资源调查队，在西沙各岛之间就曾捕获海龟六百多只（每只二百来斤），这是在附带和用简单工具的条件下进行的。
