Nearing noon, a small steamboat on the Nanwan Reservoir slowly headed west. My fellow comrades and I stood at the bow, gazing out. We saw layer upon layer of mountains naturally embracing the Nanwan Reservoir. On the vast expanse of shimmering water, clusters of green peaks emerged. The steamboat carefully navigated among these peaks. The air was fresh, and birds chirped merrily. As the peaks gradually receded behind the steamboat, we faintly glimpsed Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain.

Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain is a place where chickens are herded on the mountains. This might sound novel, but in Xinyang County, people's communes have been establishing Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains since October last year. Approximately 800,000 chickens were herded on the mountains. After a few months, the number grew to 1,080,000. This year, the county plans to increase the number of chickens to 5,700,000 (an average of ten chickens per person in the county). The large-scale collective chicken farming and the high-speed development of the chicken farming industry greatly piqued our interest. We visited the earliest established Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain in the county.

Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain is part of the Dongjiahe Comprehensive Livestock Farm of the Youhe Branch of the Hongqi People's Commune in Xinyang County. It is surrounded by water on three sides and backed by mountains on one side, with abundant grasslands and fertile land, making it an excellent pasture. Currently, there are 13,500 chickens herded on the mountain. As we were discussing how they manage the chickens spread across the mountains and fields, we heard the keeper blow a whistle. The chickens immediately flew from all directions to surround the keeper. We praised how obedient the chickens were, but the keeper said that it wasn't always like this. At first, they would fly away when they saw people and wouldn't return after foraging, making management difficult. So, we confined the chickens in a large courtyard and trained them with a whistle: when the keeper blew the whistle, the chickens would raise their heads, and the keeper would immediately scatter some feed. After repeating this many times, the chickens learned that the whistle meant food, and gradually, they obeyed the whistle.

As the keeper was speaking, suddenly, an eagle flew from the east, circling over the mountain. Strangely, all the chickens in the mountains and fields immediately stopped their clucking and became silent. Then, they swiftly burrowed into the small air-raid shelters (pre-dug by the keeper) in the mountain hollows. After a while, the eagle flew away, and the chickens gradually emerged.

An old man with a gun slung over his shoulder walked towards us. He was in charge of both herding the chickens and watching for eagles. We asked him about the situation with birds and animal pests here. He smiled and said:

"This area is in the shallow mountainous region of the Dabie Mountains. The surrounding mountains are not very high, and it is surrounded by water on three sides, so there are not many animal pests. Since the farm was established, no chickens have been harmed by animals. The main concern is eagles, but now that we have air-raid shelters, the eagles can't do anything."

Spring comes late in the mountainous area. Today, the once lush mountain slopes are still a yellowish-brown. One can imagine that it is difficult for the chickens to find food on the slopes in the depths of winter. However, the chicken farm was established last winter. How did they solve the feed problem?

We asked many keepers about this issue.

"In this rich mountainous area, the feed problem is easy to solve at any time," they all agreed. "When there's nothing to eat on the mountains in winter, there's plenty in the water. There are two or three thousand mu of water within the territory, with all kinds of aquatic plants that can't be harvested completely, as well as leaves from the trees and bran and chaff from the agricultural and sideline product processing plant of the comprehensive livestock farm..."

Their promotion of these substitute feeds has indeed solved the feed problem. The accounting office of the comprehensive livestock farm has a feed supply report that reads: In the three and a half months of winter, the 13,500 chickens, in addition to eating 235,000 jin of aquatic plants and other feeds, 12,000 jin of bran, and 70,000 jin of chaff, only consumed 30,000 jin of rice (an average of just over three qian of rice per chicken per day).

This situation shows that since the feed problem can be solved in winter by promoting substitute feeds supplemented with a small amount of rice, the feed problem will be even easier to solve in the spring, summer, and autumn.

Does feeding chickens mainly with substitute feeds affect their normal development? We visited many mountain chicken flocks and did not find this problem. When the farm was first established, most of the 13,000 chickens weighed six or seven liang. Now, after only three or four months of feeding, they generally weigh more than one jin, and many weigh two or three jin.

The chicken coops are all built on the mountaintops. The farm built approximately 80 chicken coops to accommodate the 10,000 chickens. Initially, we were worried about the construction costs of this large number of chicken coops. I asked Ying Xiangyu, the secretary of the comprehensive livestock farm's branch, "How much did it cost to build so many chicken coops?" "It didn't cost much," he said firmly. Seeing my skepticism, he explained, "The timber is from the mountains, the bamboo is from the mountains, the thatch is from the mountains... everything is locally sourced, so what does it cost?" After a pause, he added, "If you have to talk about spending money, building these 80 houses only cost less than ten yuan for nails."

In our imagination, raising more than 10,000 chickens would require a lot of labor. However, Mei Youchun, the head of the First Chicken Farm, told us that they have 5,230 chickens here, managed by only eleven people, an average of more than 1,300 chickens per person. Herding chickens on the mountain is so labor-saving!

Our conversation turned to the issue of egg laying.

"If chickens are herded on the mountain, they will inevitably lay eggs all over the place. What do you do?" some comrades asked.

"We have already studied a solution," Mei Youchun said. "When domestic chickens lay eggs, they are prepared with a straw nest in advance, and the chicken will go there to lay eggs each time. Now we refer to this method, placing straw nests near the air-raid shelters in the mountain hollows (or using the air-raid shelters) and covering the top with simple thatched roofs, so the chickens will go there to lay eggs."

Eggs are a major source of income from chicken farming. With so many chickens raised here, what will the egg income be this year? Secretary Ying said that normally a hen lays twelve or thirteen jin of eggs a year, but here they calculate it at ten jin. The 10,000 laying hens on the farm can lay 100,000 jin of eggs, which is worth 45,000 yuan at local market prices, equivalent to the value of 700,000 jin of rice produced from 500 mu of land. This is truly a large income. Secretary Ying enthusiastically continued, "Chicken manure is also a large source of income. In the three months since the farm was established, 9,000 jin of chicken manure have been sold, generating an income of more than 6,000 yuan."

Secretary Ying said that this year's income from eggs and chicken manure alone will reach 73,000 yuan. Due to the high income, they plan to increase the number of chickens to 100,000 this year.

It has been a few days since we left Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain. Thinking of this rich mountainous area, especially the people here, we cannot forget them. For many years, people have not paid much attention to barren mountains. Now, they have creatively turned them into chicken farms, herding chicken flocks on a large scale. In mid-November last year, the Xinyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting here, summarizing their experience in establishing Ten Thousand Chicken Mountain and promoting it throughout the county—in fact, their experience is more than just applicable to one county! How many mountainous areas like this are there in the country? They can all establish thousands upon thousands of Ten Thousand Chicken Mountains based on the experiences here and adapting to local conditions. (Attached picture)

    访“万鸡山”
    新华社记者　古维进
    快到中午，南湾水库的一艘小轮船慢慢地往西开行。我和同行的几个同志立在船头纵目一望，只见重重叠叠的山峦把南湾水库天然地环抱着，在碧波万顷的水面，露出一群一群的绿色的山峰，轮船小心翼翼地穿行在群峰之间。空气清新，鸟雀欢快地啾鸣着。当群峰渐渐地留在轮船背后，我们隐约望见万鸡山了。
    万鸡山，就是在山上放牧鸡群的地方，这在人们听来，也许是一件新鲜事情，但是在信阳县，各人民公社从去年10月份起已经普遍建立了万鸡山，约有八十万只鸡在山上放牧，数月后，鸡发展到了一百零八万只。今年，全县又计划把鸡发展到五百七十万只（全县平均每人有十只鸡）大规模的集体养鸡，高速度的发展养鸡事业，引起我们极大的兴趣。我们访问了这个属于全县建立最早的万鸡山。
    万鸡山是河南信阳县红旗人民公社游河分社董家河综合牧场的一个组成部分，三面临水，一面靠山，草原丰富，土地肥沃，是一个良好的牧场。现在这里有一万三千五百只鸡在山上放牧。我们正谈论着他们怎样看管这满山遍野的鸡时，只听得饲养员把哨子一吹，群鸡就马上从四面八方飞到饲养员的周围。我们都称赞鸡这样的听话，但是饲养员说，开始并不是这样的，那时它们见人就乱飞，出去觅食不知道回来，管理很困难。我们就把鸡关在大院子里用哨子训练：饲养员把哨子一吹，鸡都抬起了头，饲养员立即撒上一把饲料，这样反复多次以后，鸡懂得哨音一响就有吃的，渐渐地就听哨音指挥了。
    饲养员正说着，忽然，东面飞来一个老鹰在山头上盘旋，说也奇怪，满山遍野的鸡立即停止咯咯咯的声音，变成一片寂静，紧接着，都敏捷地钻进了山坳里的小防空洞（饲养员事先挖好的）。一会儿，老鹰过去，鸡又陆续地钻出来了。
    一个背枪的老汉向我们走过来，他是牧鸡兼看鹰的。我们向他打听这里的鸟兽害情形。他笑笑说：
    “这里属大别山的浅山区，周围的山都不大，又三面靠水，兽害是不多的，建场以来，还没有发现鸡遭过兽害呢，比较操心的是老鹰，可是现在有了防空洞，老鹰也没有办法了。”
    山区的春天来得比较迟，如今，往日牧草茂盛的山坡还是一片苍黄，可以想到，在隆冬季节里，鸡很难在山坡找到吃的东西。但是鸡场是建立在去年冬季，他们怎样解决饲料问题呢？
    我们向许多饲养员了解这个问题。
    “在这个富饶的山区，不管什么时候，饲料问题都是好办的。”这是他们一致的意见，“冬天山上没吃的，水里有的是，境内两三千亩水面，各种各样的水草捞不完，还有树上的叶子和综合畜牧场的农副产品加工厂的糠皮、秕谷……”。
    他们推广这些代用饲料，确实解决了饲料问题。综合畜牧场会计室有一份饲料供应情况这样写着：冬季三个半月来，一万三千五百只鸡除吃水草等二十三万五千斤、糠皮一万二千斤、秕谷七万斤外，只吃了稻谷三万斤（平均一只鸡一天吃稻谷三钱多）。
    这个情况表明，既然在冬季可以以推广代用饲料为主配搭少量稻谷解决饲料问题，那么，到了春夏秋三季，饲料问题更加容易解决了。
    以代用饲料为主喂养鸡，是不是影响鸡的正常发育呢？我们参观了许多山头的鸡群，并没有发现这个问题。初建场时，一万三千多只鸡大部分是六、七两的，现在经过短短的三、四个月饲养，一般都长到一斤以上，二、三斤的也不在少数。
    鸡舍都是建筑在山顶上。全场大约盖了八十多间鸡舍才解决了一万多只鸡的栖息问题。开始，我们都为这一大批鸡舍的建筑费用担心。我和综合畜牧场的支部书记应向雨说：“盖这么多鸡舍花了多少钱？”“没花什么钱。”他的口气很坚定，看见我半信半疑，他解释说：“木材是山里的，竹子是山里的，茅草是山里的……一切就地取材，还花什么钱呢？”停了停又说：“要说花钱的话，盖这八十多间房子只开支了不到十元钱的洋钉费。”
    在我们的想像中，饲养一万多只鸡，恐怕需要花费许多劳动力。但是，第一鸡场的负责人梅友春告诉我们，这里有五千二百三十只鸡，只用了十一个人管理，平均每人牧鸡一千三百多只。在山上放牧鸡群多么节约劳力啊！
    我们的谈话转到鸡的下蛋问题。
    “鸡在山上放牧，下蛋必然是满山遍野，怎么办呢？”有的同志问。
    “我们已经研究了办法。”梅友春说，“家庭养鸡下蛋的时候，事先给它准备一个草窝，鸡就每次到那里下蛋。现在我们参照这个办法，在山坳的防空洞附近（或利用防空洞）絮上草窝，顶上加盖简单的草篷，这样鸡就去下蛋了。”
    鸡蛋，是养鸡的一项主要收入，这里喂了这么多鸡，今年的鸡蛋收入怎样呢？应书记说，通常一只母鸡一年下蛋十二、三斤，这里就以十斤计算，全场现有的一万产卵鸡可下蛋十万斤，按当地市价可值四万五千元，相当于五百亩田地生产七十余万斤稻谷的价值。这真是一项很大的收入。应书记兴致勃勃地继续说：“鸡粪也是一项很大的收入。建场三个多月来，已售出鸡粪九千斤，收入六千多元。”
    应书记说，今年光是鸡蛋和鸡粪的收入，要达七万三千元。由于收入大，今年计划把鸡发展到十万只。
    离开万鸡山有几天了，想起这个富饶的山区，特别是这里的人们，我们就念念不忘。多少年来，人们对于荒山都是不重视的，如今，他们创造性地把它变成鸡场，在山上大规模的放牧鸡群。去年11月中旬，中共信阳县委在这里召开现场会议，总结他们建立万鸡山的经验，在全县推广——其实他们的经验，何止推广到一个县呢！全国有多少像这样的山区呵，他们都可以根据这里的经验结合当地的情况因地制宜的建立千千万万的万鸡山。（附图片）
