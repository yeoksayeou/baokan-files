Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd – China's pharmaceutical industry will achieve even greater leaps forward this year, primarily by focusing on the development of various drugs with significant therapeutic effects and widespread use. The output of antibiotic drugs, sulfa drugs, and drugs for the prevention and treatment of the four major endemic diseases, schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria, will all increase significantly compared to last year. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Commerce recently convened pharmaceutical production and supply meetings, respectively, to determine this year's production and supply tasks.

Both meetings believe that in 1958, amidst China's comprehensive Great Leap Forward and the mass movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, the pharmaceutical industry achieved corresponding development. The output of antibiotics increased more than threefold compared to 1957, and nearly five hundred new products were researched and successfully trial-produced. However, due to the relatively weak foundation of China's basic chemical industry, the raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry cannot be fully supplied. The two meetings decided that this year, it is necessary to exert great effort to overcome the raw material bottleneck, first focusing on the development of various antibiotics, sulfa drugs, vitamins, and other drugs with significant therapeutic effects and widespread use. At the same time, in coordination with the health departments' measures to basically eliminate endemic diseases such as schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria in all possible areas, it is necessary to vigorously develop various drugs for treating endemic diseases.

The pharmaceutical production professional meeting convened by the Ministry of Chemical Industry focused on studying a series of measures to solve the raw material problem. The pharmaceutical supply meeting convened by the Ministry of Commerce also focused on studying the issue of assisting the pharmaceutical industry departments in developing production. The meeting believes that the commercial departments have extensive connections with various parties and should combine work-study programs in medical colleges and universities and organize hospitals and other relevant parties to vigorously develop chemical raw material intermediates to expand the source of pharmaceutical raw materials.

    化工部商业部确定今年药品生产供应任务
    重点增产疗效大用途广的药品
    据新华社3日讯　我国医药工业今年将有更大的跃进，首先是重点地发展疗效显著、使用广泛的各种药品。抗菌素类药品、磺胺类药品、防治血吸虫、血丝虫、钩虫、疟疾等四种主要地方病的药品的产量，都将比去年有很大增长。化学工业部和商业部最近分别召开的医药生产和供应会议上，确定了今年的生产和供应任务。
    两个会议认为，1958年在我国全面大跃进和群众性的除四害讲卫生运动中，医药工业得到了相应的发展，抗菌素的产量比1957年增加了三倍多，研究和试制成功了近五百种新产品。但是由于我国基本化学工业的基础比较薄弱，医药工业的原料还不能充分供应。两个会议决定今年要鼓足干劲，大力突破原料关，首先重点地发展疗效显著、使用广泛的各种抗菌素、磺胺、维生素等药品，同时配合卫生部门在一切可能的地方基本上消灭血吸虫、血丝虫、钩虫、疟疾等地方病的措施，要大力发展各种治疗地方病的药品。
    化工部召开的医药生产专业会议上，着重研究了解决原料问题的一系列措施。商业部召开的医药供应会议上，也着重研究了协助医药工业部门发展生产的问题。会议认为，商业部门与各方面有广泛的联系，应当结合医学院校的勤工俭学，和组织医院等有关方面大搞化工原料中间体，以扩大制药原料来源。
