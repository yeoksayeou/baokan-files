    A New Commune Member

    One day, the Hubin People's Commune in Boxing County welcomed a new commune member. He was Comrade Gao Deming, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee.

    The second day after Deputy Secretary Gao arrived at the commune, it rained incessantly, and work in the fields was impossible. He thought to himself, if other work can't be done, I'll go to the canteen and take a look. When he arrived at the canteen, he helped wash vegetables. After eating, he went out in the rain to repair the pigsty and tidy up the turnip cellar, getting soaked to the bone.

    His first day of labor left a deep impression on the commune members. However, the commune members were still very polite to him, and the production team cadres were embarrassed to assign him tasks. Comrade Gao Deming thought: "The masses still don't see me as an ordinary laborer, so I must put down my airs and become one with them." Whenever there was work to be done, he always took the lead. If he didn't understand something, he would ask. During breaks, he would enjoy himself with the commune members. Seeing how diligent and unpretentious he was, the masses gradually began to treat him as one of their own. The elderly neighbors would also come to his house to chat whenever they had free time. The cadres also treated him as an ordinary commune member, assigning him tasks just like everyone else.

    In the days of eating, living, and working alongside the commune members, living among the masses, every feeling was fresh and profound. It not only enriched his production knowledge but also his leadership experience, enabling him to more deeply understand the thoughts, feelings, and demands of the masses. During topdressing of wheat fields, according to the county party committee's requirements, each mu required 100,000 jin of fertilizer. When this commune discussed this issue, some cadres said, "How to apply 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu is a problem." Some cadres thought that Comrade Gao Deming was the deputy secretary of the county party committee and consulted him. Comrade Gao Deming, while working, studied the problem with the commune members. One commune member said, "It is indeed necessary to apply 100,000 jin of fertilizer, and it is not difficult to apply if we adopt a method of applying it in stages." This immediately grasped the key to the problem. Comrade Gao Deming immediately helped the commune solve the problem of topdressing and reflected this experience to the county party committee. The county party committee then promoted the experience of applying fertilizer in stages and breaking through the fertilizer source barrier to the entire county, quickly promoting a high tide of topdressing throughout the county.

    一个新社员
    一天，博兴县湖滨人民公社来了个新社员。他就是县委副书记高德明同志。
    高副书记到公社的第二天，小雨下个不停，田里的活没法干。他心里想，别的活不能干，就到食堂里看看吧。他到了食堂就帮着洗菜。吃罢饭，冒着雨去修猪圈，收拾萝卜窖，浑身都被雨淋透了。
    第一天的劳动，就给社员留下深刻的印象。可是社员对他还是很客气，生产队的干部也不好意思指派他。高德明同志心想：“群众还没有把我看成一个普通的劳动者啊，那就一定要放下架子，和他们打成一片。”凡是干活，他总是抢在头里，不会不懂的就问，休息时和社员们一块娱乐，群众看到他那样勤快，那样没有一点架子，慢慢地就把他当做自己人了。邻居的老人，一有空也都到他屋子里去玩，干部们也把他当做一个普通社员，和大家一样地分配给他任务。
    在和社员同吃、同住、同劳动的日子里，生活在群众之间，一切感受都是新鲜的、深刻的。不仅丰富了生产知识，而且丰富了领导经验，使领导更能深刻地体会到群众的思想感情和要求。在麦田追肥中，依照县委要求，每亩要追十万斤。这个社在讨论这个问题的时候，有些干部说：“每亩追十万斤肥，怎么追上去倒是个问题。”有的干部觉得高德明同志是县委副书记，就请教他。高德明同志就一面劳动，一面和社员研究。有一位社员说：“追十万斤肥确实很需要，只要采取分期追的办法，追上去并不难。”这一下子就抓住了问题的关键，高德明同志马上帮助这个社解决了追肥的问题，并把这一经验反映给县委。县委又把分期追肥、突破肥源关的经验推广到全县，迅速推动全县掀起了追肥高潮。（附图片）
