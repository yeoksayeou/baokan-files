Unveiling the Secrets of the 460,000 Square Kilometer Desert
Taklamakan Oil Survey Completed One Year Ahead of Schedule
Exploration Workers Bravely Overcome Sandstorms and Discover Numerous Potentially Oil-Bearing Structures and Ancient Inhabitant Relics

Urumqi, March 15th (This newspaper) – The oil survey of the world-renowned Taklamakan Desert has been successfully completed one year ahead of schedule. Thus, the true face of this desert, covering more than 460,000 square kilometers, has begun to be unveiled. Exploration teams have discovered more than a dozen potentially oil-bearing structures in the desert, as well as underground water, virgin forests, ancient settlements, and unique animals.

The Taklamakan Desert is located in the center of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, bordering the Tarim River to the north and the foot of the Kunlun Mountains to the south. It is approximately 500 kilometers wide from north to south and over 1,000 kilometers long from east to west, with a total area of over 460,000 square kilometers. "Taklamakan" means "enter and never return" in the Uyghur language. Many mythical legends circulate in the Uyghur villages surrounding the desert: a long time ago, this place was a flat land, but after forty days of black wind, this flat land turned into a desert. In the past, Chinese archaeologists and foreign travelers wanted to enter the desert to explore its secrets, but all failed. In recent years, Xinjiang petroleum exploration workers have discovered more than forty structures with oil potential around the desert. Based on these circumstances, petroleum geologists believe that the Taklamakan Desert, located in the center of the Tarim Basin, may also have oil potential. In the spring of 1958, the Tarim Mining Bureau of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration organized a youth shock exploration team with geological, topographic, and gravity-magnetic survey specialties, launching a heroic feat to explore the secrets of the Taklamakan Desert. This heroic survey team used a large number of camels to carry drinking water, food, cooking equipment, tools, and light luggage, and entered the desert in groups. They carried out arduous labor in this boundless, yellow-sand-rolling desert without a drop of surface water. During the day, the team members carried out survey work, and at night, they also had to dig wells to find water for the camels. In order to ensure that they would not run out of water midway, everyone did not wash their faces or brush their teeth every day, and each person only drank three catties of water per day. The water used to wash the rice was used to wash the pots, and the water used to wash the pots one day was kept until the next morning to wash the pots again, and then given to the camels to drink. During the day, the temperature in the desert reached as high as 42 degrees Celsius, and the team members' lips cracked from thirst, and many people had nosebleeds, but everyone still persevered in their work. The first group of team members failed to dig out underground water for six consecutive days after entering the desert.

The entire group of people and animals were in danger of falling into desperation, and the camel drivers also began to panic. Zhao Hongquan, the Communist Party member and group leader, said to everyone: In history, many people have declared failure and retreated from the desert under such circumstances, but we, the people of New China, are brave and fearless people, we only advance and never retreat. After everyone's discussion, they finally came up with a solution. They decided to reduce the water consumption of people to save the camels. They continued to move forward in this way for three days, and finally dug out underground water.

The Taklamakan Desert has wind almost every day. When the wind rises, sand flies, the sky is dark, people cannot stand still, and their eyes cannot be opened. The sand rolls underfoot, sand dunes turn into flat ground in an instant, and gullies become sand dunes again. Working under such circumstances, the observers could not open their eyes, and the surveyor's poles could not stand firmly in the wind. In order to improve the progress, the team members put forward the combat slogan of "work harder in light winds, work hard in small winds, and work extra hard when there is no wind." When the wind was strong, they shortened the distance between the surveyor's poles and measured bit by bit. When the wind was small, they immediately lengthened the measuring distance. In the morning and evening when there was no wind in the desert, they started work early and finished late every day, using tense labor to seize this golden time. The national quota for desert traverse surveying was eight kilometers per day, but they achieved more than twenty kilometers and created the national record of thirty-two kilometers per day under level three terrain conditions.

Because they overcame the wind and sand and improved the speed of their work, they were able to cross the desert on time each time, avoiding the danger of running out of water and food midway. The original plan was for two teams to complete the survey of the entire desert in two years, but as a result, one team completed it in one year. After hard work, this team discovered an outcrop of Tertiary strata several hundred kilometers long that had not been covered by yellow sand in the desert. This stratum outcrop not only provided valuable information for understanding the stratigraphic structure of the desert, but also provided extremely valuable clues for further understanding oil-bearing structures. More than a dozen potentially oil-bearing structures have also been discovered in the southwest and southeast regions of the desert. Originally, people thought that no water could be found in the entire desert, but the exploration team members found underground water in most of the areas they passed through, and even dug out sweet water in individual places. South of Mazartag in the southwest of the desert, there are patches of lush reeds. In the heart of the desert, there are large tracts of withered virgin forests, most of which are thick Populus euphratica trees, some of which are still alive. East of the Yutian River, the team members discovered an ancient settlement. Remnants of about three hundred houses were scattered over an area of more than thirty square kilometers. The walls of the houses have collapsed, but the supports and door frames still exist. The structure and style of the houses do not resemble the residences of Uyghur farmers in southern Xinjiang, but are similar to the more elaborate residences of Han people. On the sandy land around this settlement, there are many remnants of pottery jars and clay pots, as well as copper ancient coins and other valuable materials for research. In several entries into the middle of the desert, the exploration team members saw wild camels, gazelles, rabbits, mice, lizards, and unique birds and other animals. (Miao Di illustration)

    揭开46万平方公里沙漠的秘密
    塔克拉玛干石油普查任务提前一年完成
    勘探工作者历尽千辛万苦战胜狂风滚沙发现许多可能含油构造和古代居民遗迹
    本报乌鲁木齐15日电　世界闻名的塔克拉玛干大沙漠的石油普查工作提前一年胜利完成。至此，这片拥有四十六万多平方公里的沙漠真面目已开始被揭破。勘探队员们在沙漠里发现了十多个有含油可能的构造，还发现了地下水、原始森林、古代居民点和奇异的动物。
    塔克拉玛干大沙漠位于新疆塔里木盆地中央，北起塔里木河，南到昆仑山下，南北宽约五百公里，东西长约一千多公里，沙漠面积共四十六万多平方公里。“塔克拉玛干”在维吾尔族语里的意思是进去出不来。沙漠外围的维吾尔族农村流传着许多神话般的传说：很早以前这里是一片平地，后来，刮了四十天黑风，这块平地就变成了一片沙漠了。过去，中国的考古学家和外国的旅行家都曾想进沙漠去探索它的秘密。结果都失败了。近几年来，新疆石油勘探工作者在大沙漠周围发现了四十多个有含油希望的构造，石油地质家们根据这些情况认为，位于塔里木盆地中央的塔克拉玛干大沙漠也可能有含油希望。1958年春天，新疆石油管理局塔里木矿务局组织了一支有地质、地形和重磁力等勘测工种的青年突击勘探队，发起了探索塔克拉玛干大沙漠秘密的壮举。这支英雄的普查队用大批骆驼驮上生活用水、食物、锅灶、工具和轻装行李，分组进入沙漠，他们在这片茫无边际，黄沙滚滚，没有一滴地面水的沙漠里进行着艰苦的劳动。队员们白天在进行普查工作，夜晚，还要为骆驼挖井找水。为了保证中途不致断水，大家每天不洗脸，不刷牙，每天每人只饮三斤水，淘了米的水洗锅，先一天洗锅水还要留到第二天早晨再洗锅，然后又去饮骆驼。白天沙漠气温高达摄氏四十二度，队员们渴得嘴唇裂了缝，许多人流鼻血，但大家仍然坚持工作。第一组的队员们，进入沙漠后接连六天一直未挖出地下水。
    全组人畜已有陷入绝境的危险，骆驼夫也开始恐慌不安。共产党员组长赵鸿铨对大家说：历史上许多人就在这种情况下宣告失败退出沙漠的，我们新中国的人民是英勇无畏的人，只有前进，决不后退。经过大家讨论，终于想出办法。他们决定缩减人的用水来抢救骆驼。这样继续前进了三天，终于挖出了地下水。
    塔克拉玛干大沙漠几乎每天都有风。风起沙飞，天昏地暗，人站不住、眼睁不开，沙子在脚下滚滚流动，沙丘顿时变为平地，沟壑又成了沙丘。在这样的情况下工作，观测员睁不开眼，花杆被风吹得立不稳。为了提高进度，队员们提出大风小干，小风大干，无风加油干的战斗口号。风刮的大了，他们就缩短花杆距离，一点一点地测，风一小，立即放长测距；早晨和黄昏沙漠无风，他们每天提早出工，晚收工，以紧张的劳动来抢这段黄金时间。沙漠导线测量，国家定额每天为八公里，他们却达到了二十公里以上，并在三级地形条件下创造了日测三十二公里的全国最高纪录。
    由于他们战胜了风沙、提高了工作速度，每次都按预定时间穿出沙漠，避免了中途水尽粮绝的危险，原来计划以两个队在两年时间普查完毕整个大沙漠的计划，结果他们一个队在一年内就完成了。经过辛勤的劳动，这个队在沙漠中发现了一块几百公里长、未被黄沙复盖的第三纪地层露头，这个地层露头不仅为了解大沙漠的地层结构提供了宝贵的资料，而且对进一步了解含油构造，也提供了极有价值的线索。在沙漠西南和东南地区还发现了十多个有可能含油的构造。原来人们认为整个沙漠都找不到水，但勘探队员们在他们经过的大部分地区都挖到了地下水，并在个别地方还挖出了甜水。沙漠西南玛扎尔塔克以南有葱绿的片片芦苇，沙漠心脏地带有大片干枯了的原始森林，其中大部分为粗大的胡杨树，其中个别地方的胡杨仍然活着。在于阗河东部，队员们发现了一座古代居民点，在三十多平方公里的面积上散布着约有三百多幢房舍的残迹。房舍墙垣皆已坍毁，支架和门框尚存，房屋的结构和式样不像南疆维吾尔族农民的住所，近似汉族人比较讲究的住所。在这个居民点周围的沙地上，有许多陶罐和泥土盆的残迹，还有铜质古钱等有研究价值的资料，勘探队员们在几次进入沙漠中间，都看到了野骆驼、黄羊、兔子、老鼠、四脚蛇和奇异的小鸟等动物。（苗地插图）
