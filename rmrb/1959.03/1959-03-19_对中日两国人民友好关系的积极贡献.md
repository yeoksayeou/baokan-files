The visit of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China is about to come to a successful conclusion. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, issued a joint statement on the 17th after friendly and sincere talks. The joint statement indicates that this visit by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation has achieved concrete results, which not only played an extremely important role in breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and enhancing the friendship between the two peoples, but also made beneficial contributions to promoting the common cause of the Chinese and Japanese peoples in safeguarding Far Eastern and international peace.

The joint statement believes that the increasing development of anti-imperialist forces throughout the world “is very beneficial to Japan’s smashing of the Japan-U.S. ‘Security Treaty’ system and the return of territories such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, as well as China’s cause of liberating Taiwan. At the same time, in order to oppose the Cold War, oppose atomic warfare, realize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of Bandung, and ensure peace in Asia and the world, the two peoples must join hands.” The emphasis placed on this point by both sides is of great significance. After the war, both the Chinese and Japanese people have been threatened by the U.S. aggressive and war policies, and our struggles have always been closely related. The U.S. imperialist aggression against China's territory Taiwan, the military control and occupation of the Japanese mainland and Okinawa, and the use of these places as bases for launching aggressive wars and military provocations, have infringed upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and seriously threatened the security of the two peoples. The United States refuses to ban nuclear weapons testing, and is establishing nuclear war bases in the Far East and Japan, stepping up the planning of the so-called Northeast Asia military alliance, and constantly creating tension, threatening the peace of China, Japan and the entire Asian region. In particular, in recent months, U.S. imperialism has attempted to further push Japan onto the road of preparing for war through the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," in order to act as a vanguard for U.S. aggression against Asia, which not only brings serious war danger to the Japanese people, but also directly threatens China's security. These facts show that the Chinese and Japanese people have a common task of opposing U.S. aggressive and war policies. In this common struggle, the Chinese and Japanese people should and can better support and encourage each other, so as to exert greater strength and make more contributions to the common cause of the Chinese and Japanese people and the peace of Asia and the world.

The joint statement points out the only correct way to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides unanimously believe that in order to break the current deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, "economic and political issues between the two countries must be discussed and resolved simultaneously, and at present, political issues must take priority." This is the fundamental principle for resolving Sino-Japanese relations in the future, drawn from the most important lessons in post-war Sino-Japanese relations. In recent years, due to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people and the active support of the Chinese government, exchanges between the people of China and Japan once experienced great development. In view of the geographical and historical relationship between China and Japan and the situation of the Japanese people after the war, the Chinese people once hoped that, in the absence of the lifting of the state of war between the two countries, friendly and trade exchanges between China and Japan could be promoted through non-governmental activities, and the Japanese government could be gradually pushed to take corresponding measures to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries, and finally achieve the goal of restoring diplomatic relations and concluding a peace treaty between the two countries. This was originally a path extremely beneficial to both the Chinese and Japanese people. However, the efforts made by the Chinese and Japanese people to realize this path have been blocked by Nobusuke Kishi’s policy of submitting to the United States and being hostile to China. Nobusuke Kishi mistakenly regarded this goodwill of the Chinese people as a sign of weakness, and he vainly attempted to take economic advantage of the non-governmental exchanges between China and Japan, while at the same time maintaining his potentially imperialist policy of being politically hostile to China and bullying China. The Chinese people certainly cannot tolerate this situation. The Chinese people have learned an extremely important lesson from this, that is, the relationship between China and Japan must be resolved through government-to-government negotiations, and political and economic issues must be negotiated and resolved together in order to truly open the road to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. May I ask, in the absence of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the end of the state of war, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the continued submission of the Kishi Nobusuke government to the United States in hostility to China, can economic issues be discussed without first resolving political issues? Can all non-governmental agreements, especially trade agreements, be smoothly implemented without the definite guarantee of the Japanese government? Isn't the lesson of the tearing up of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement profound enough? As for political solutions, the Chinese people clearly put forward three principles half a year ago, that is, the Kishi Nobusuke government must: (1) stop implementing policies hostile to China; (2) not participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; and (3) not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan; and take corresponding measures. These are the necessary conditions for breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. Only when these conditions are realized can further solutions to political issues between China and Japan be possible, and can the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade be considered. Otherwise, nothing can be discussed. However, Nobusuke Kishi has suffered a strong backlash from the Japanese people for his reactionary policy of following the United States and being hostile to China. In order to get rid of this unfavorable situation, he has recently repeatedly played the old tune of breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations under the principle of separating politics and economics. This shows that Nobusuke Kishi has no sincerity in improving Sino-Japanese relations, and his real purpose is to continue to be politically hostile to China, while at the same time vainly attempting to gain economic benefits from China, and under the guise of "restoring Sino-Japanese trade," shift the responsibility for continuing to僵化 Sino-Japanese relations to the Chinese side. The sinister intentions of Nobusuke Kishi can be seen from this. But this two-faced trick cannot deceive anyone. Everyone knows that in the relationship between countries, politics and economics cannot be separated. "Only talk about trade, not politics" is just a fallacy created by Nobusuke Kishi. In fact, even Nobusuke Kishi himself has never separated politics and economics. His so-called principle of separating politics and economics is the specific manifestation of his everywhere subservience to the United States and his consistent hostility to China, which is the biggest politics. The Chinese and Japanese people will never allow Nobusuke Kishi to continue to play this two-faced trick. This time, the Japanese Socialist Party delegation discussed this key issue in Sino-Japanese relations with relevant Chinese parties and reached a consensus, which is of great significance for promoting the further development of the Japanese movement to restore diplomatic relations with China.

The Chinese people emphasize that Sino-Japanese relations must start with political issues and must be resolved through government channels. This does not mean that we underestimate the people's diplomacy between China and Japan. On the contrary, under the circumstances that the Kishi Nobusuke government stubbornly adheres to its policy of hostility towards China, further developing people's diplomacy is of great significance for consolidating the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and strengthening the common struggle of the two peoples against artificial obstacles that hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese people have always distinguished between the Japanese people and the Kishi Nobusuke government. Although the current deadlock in relations between the two countries has not yet been broken, the Chinese people will still do their best to promote friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between the people of the two countries. The Chinese people also express deep sympathy for the difficulties faced by some small Japanese enterprises and working people due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's destruction of Sino-Japanese trade.

The joint statement particularly emphasizes the relationship between Japan's breaking of the so-called Japan-U.S. "security guarantee" system and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the establishment of collective security in the Far East. Today, the biggest difficulty Japan encounters in its foreign relations is that the United States controls Japan politically, militarily, and economically, making it impossible for the Japanese people to realize their strong desire to take the road of peace and neutrality and restore diplomatic relations with China. Therefore, only by getting rid of U.S. control and implementing an independent and autonomous policy can Japan establish peaceful and friendly relations with all countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of Bandung. The joint statement points out that as long as Japan smashes the Japan-U.S. "security guarantee" system, realizes complete independence, and concludes non-aggression pacts with China and the Soviet Union, it can be expected that the military clauses of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance targeting Japanese militarism will naturally become invalid. And after the establishment of collective security in the Asian and Pacific regions, Japan's neutral status will be further guaranteed. This points out an infinitely bright prospect for Japan to take the road of peace and neutrality. After Japan becomes an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country, it can develop economic exchanges with all countries, live in friendship, and prosper together. China and Japan have a long and close economic relationship. As long as the Japanese government abandons its policy of hostility towards China, restores diplomatic relations with China, and develops friendly relations, the economic relationship between China and Japan will be greatly developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Promoting the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and restoring normal relations between the two countries is the common will of the Chinese and Japanese people. Nobusuke Kishi's insistence on implementing a reactionary policy that violates the will of the Japanese people is destined to fail. The Japanese Socialist Party's position of actively fighting against Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary policy undoubtedly reflects the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people and is in the interests of the Chinese and Japanese people. The Chinese people express warm support for the various efforts made by the friends of the Japanese Socialist Party in defending peace, opposing U.S. aggression, and improving Sino-Japanese relations.

We believe that through this visit by the Socialist Party delegation, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people will be further developed. As long as the people of our two countries persist in their efforts, all artificial obstacles can be overcome, and the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is bound to be realized.

### 对中日两国人民友好关系的积极贡献

    对中日两国人民友好关系的积极贡献
    日本社会党代表团对我国的访问即将圆满结束了。中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎，经过友好和诚挚的会谈，于17日发表了共同声明。共同声明表明，日本社会党代表团这次的访问已经收到了具体的成效，不仅对打开中日关系的僵局和增进两国人民的友好起了极为重要的推动作用，而且对于促进中日两国人民维护远东和国际和平的共同事业也作出了有益的贡献。
    共同声明认为，目前全世界反对帝国主义的力量的日益发展，“对于日本的粉碎日美‘安全保障’体制和冲绳、小笠原群岛等领土的归还日本，以及中国解放台湾的事业，是十分有利的。同时，为着反对冷战，反对原子战争，实现和平共处五项原则和万隆十项原则，确保亚洲和全世界的和平，两国人民必须携起手来。”双方特别强调地指出这一点，是有着十分重大的意义的。战后中日两国人民都受到美国侵略政策和战争政策的威胁，我们的斗争一直就是息息相关的。美帝国主义对中国领土台湾的侵略，对日本本土和冲绳的军事控制和占领，并利用这些地方作为发动侵略战争和军事挑衅的基地，侵犯了两国的主权和领土完整，严重地威胁着两国人民的安全。美国拒绝禁止核武器试验，并在远东和日本建立核子战争基地，加紧策划所谓东北亚军事同盟，不断制造紧张局势，威胁了中日两国和整个亚洲地区的和平。特别是近几个月来，美帝国主义力图通过日美“安全条约”的修改，进一步把日本驱上准备战争的道路，以便替美国侵略亚洲打先锋，这不仅给日本人民带来了严重的战争危险，并且直接威胁着中国的安全。这些事实说明，中日两国人民之间有着反对美国侵略政策和战争政策的共同任务。在这个共同斗争中，中日两国人民完全应该而且可以更好地互相支持，互相鼓舞，从而发挥更大的力量，为中日两国人民的共同事业以及亚洲和全世界的和平作出更多的贡献。
    共同声明指出了打开中日关系的僵局和促进中日关系正常化的唯一正确的途径。双方一致认为，要想打开当前中日关系的僵局，两国之间的“经济和政治问题必须同时商谈同时解决，而且在当前，政治问题必须居于优先地位”。这是汲取了战后中日关系中最重要的教训而得出来的今后解决中日关系问题的根本原则。最近几年来，由于中日两国人民的共同努力，由于中国政府的积极支持，中日两国人民之间的交往曾经一度有很大的发展。鉴于中日两国的地理和历史关系和战后日本人民的处境，中国人民曾经希望在两国战争状态还没有解除的情况下能够通过民间活动促进中日之间的友好和贸易往来，逐步推动日本政府采取相应措施，促进两国关系的正常化，最后达到两国恢复邦交、缔结和约的目标。这本来是一条对中日两国人民都极为有利的道路。但是中日两国人民为了实现这条道路而进行的努力却被岸信介屈服美国、敌视中国的政策所堵塞了。岸信介把中国人民的这种善意错认为是中国人民的示弱，他妄想一面利用中日民间的来往捞取经济上的实惠，而同时又保持他在政治上敌视中国、欺侮中国的潜在帝国主义政策。中国人民当然不能容忍这种情况。中国人民从这里得到了一条极为重要的教训，那就是中日两国的关系问题必须通过政府间的谈判求得解决，而且必须是政治问题和经济问题一起谈判、一起解决，才能真正打开中日关系正常化的道路。试问在中日两国间还没有建立外交关系，还没有结束战争状态，还没有缔结和约，岸信介政府继续屈从美国敌视中国的情况下，不首先解决政治问题，能谈得上解决经济问题吗？一切民间协定特别是贸易协定，如果不得到日本政府的确切保证，能够顺利地执行吗？难道第四次中日贸易协定被撕毁的教训还不够深刻吗？至于谈到政治解决，中国人民半年前就明确地提出了三原则，这就是岸信介政府必须：（1）停止执行敌视中国的政策；（2）不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋；（3）不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复；并采取与此相应的措施。这是打开中日关系僵局的必要条件，只有实现了这些条件，才有可能导致中日两国间政治问题的进一步解决，也才有可能考虑重开中日贸易的问题。否则，一切都谈不到。但是岸信介由于他所执行的追随美国、敌视中国的反动政策遭到了日本人民强有力的反击，为了摆脱这种不利的局面，最近又一再弹出在政治和经济分开的原则下打开中日关系僵局的滥调。这说明岸信介对于改善中日关系毫无诚意，他的真实目的是在政治上继续敌视中国，在经济上又妄图从中国捞取实惠，并且假借“恢复中日贸易”的招牌，把中日关系继续僵化的责任推给中国方面。岸信介用心之险毒，由此可见。但是这种两面三刀的手法是欺骗不了任何人的。谁都知道，在国家与国家的关系上，政治和经济是不能分开的。“只讲贸易，不讲政治”，不过是岸信介创造的一个谬论。其实就是岸信介本人，也从来没有把政治和经济分开过。他的所谓政治和经济分开的原则，就是他处处屈从美国和一贯敌视中国这个最大的政治的具体表现。中国人民和日本人民绝不容许岸信介继续玩弄这种两面手法。这次日本社会党代表团同中国有关方面，就中日关系中的这个关键问题进行了探讨并且取得了一致的看法，这对于推动日本恢复中日邦交运动的进一步发展具有重大意义。
    中国人民强调中日关系问题必须从政治问题着手，必须经过政府途径解决，这丝毫不意味着我们低估中日两国的人民外交。相反的，在岸信介政府顽固地坚持敌视中国的政策的情况下，进一步开展人民外交，对于巩固中日两国人民的友谊，加强两国人民反对阻挠中日关系正常化的人为障碍的共同斗争具有重大的作用。中国人民一贯把日本人民和岸信介政府加以区别对待。尽管目前两国关系的僵局还没有打开，但是中国人民仍将尽力促进两国人民的友好往来和文化交流。中国人民对于日本某些小企业和劳动人民由于岸信介政府破坏中日贸易而遭受的困难境遇，也寄予深切的同情。
    共同声明特别强调指出日本打破所谓日美“安全保障”体制同恢复中日邦交和建立远东集体安全的关系问题。今天日本在对外关系上所遭遇的最大困难，就是美国在政治上、军事上、经济上控制着日本，使日本人民要求走和平中立道路和同中国恢复邦交的强烈愿望无从实现。因此，只有摆脱美国的控制，实行独立自主的政策，日本才有可能根据和平共处五项原则和万隆十项原则，同包括中国、苏联、美国在内的各个国家建立和平共处的友好的关系。共同声明指出，只要日本粉碎了日美“安全保障”体制，实现了完全的独立，并且同中国和苏联缔结了互不侵犯协定，就可以期待以日本军国主义为对象的中苏友好同盟互助条约中对日本的军事条款将会自然归于失效。而在亚洲和太平洋地区的集体安全建立以后，日本的中立地位也将会得到进一步的保证。这就为日本走和平中立的道路指出了无限光明的前景。日本在成为一个独立、民主、和平、中立的国家以后，就可以同一切国家发展经济的往来，友好相处，共同繁荣。中日两国在经济上具有悠久和密切的联系，只要日本政府放弃敌视中国的政策，同中国恢复邦交并且发展友好关系，中日两国的经济关系就会在平等互利的基础上得到长足的发展。
    促进中日两国人民的友好，恢复两国的正常关系，是中日两国人民的共同意志。岸信介坚持执行违反日本人民意志的反动政策，是注定要失败的。日本社会党同岸信介的反动政策进行积极斗争的立场，无疑地反映了日本广大人民的愿望，是符合中日两国人民的利益的。中国人民对于日本社会党的朋友们在保卫和平、反对美国侵略、改善中日关系等问题上所做的种种努力，表示热烈的支持。
    我们相信，通过社会党代表团这次访问，中日两国人民的友好关系必将得到进一步的发展。只要我们两国人民坚持努力，一切人为的障碍都是能够克服的，中日两国关系正常化是一定要实现的。
