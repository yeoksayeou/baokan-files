Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 25th. The head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and delegation member Xi Zhongxun, left Budapest by plane this morning, March 25th, to return home.

The Hungarian party and government leaders, including Münnich, Marosán, Rónai, Kish, Kállai, Fock, Biszku, Fehér, etc., and representatives of mass organizations were at the airport to see them off. Also seeing them off at the airport were Hao Deqing, China's Ambassador to Hungary, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Hungary.

After Vice Chairman Zhu De, accompanied by Prime Minister Münnich, reviewed the guard of honor, he addressed the well-wishers.

Vice Chairman Zhu expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Hungarian Party, Government, and people for their warm welcome and cordial reception. He said that they fully appreciated that this friendly gesture embodies the Hungarian people's brotherly affection and friendly spirit towards the Chinese people, and they were very moved by this and wished to convey this profound friendship to the Chinese people. Vice Chairman Zhu then said that during their time celebrating the revolutionary holiday together, they personally witnessed the brilliant achievements made by the Hungarian people in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and in all aspects of socialist construction, especially the unprecedented development in agricultural cooperativization, under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government headed by Comrade Kádár. All of these left a deep impression on them.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that the Hungarian working class and the broad masses of people, with a traditional spirit of revolutionary struggle, support and actively endorse the political line and policies of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and are closely united around the Party and the Government, marching forward with firm and rapid strides on the road of socialist construction with full confidence. They felt boundless joy and encouragement for this. They firmly believed that the Hungarian people would continue to achieve new and greater victories in the cause of socialist construction and safeguarding world peace. The fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Hungarian people, united in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will be strengthened and developed day by day.

Prime Minister Münnich said in his speech that the support of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, as well as the Chinese comrades, has given our struggle tremendous strength. The working people of our country have learned lessons from the failure of the Soviet Republic and the 1956 counter-revolutionary events. Now, young people and old veterans are firmly defending the people's power together. He emphasized that our Party, through steadfast work, has eliminated the ideological confusion caused by the counter-revolutionary riots, and is fighting with steel-like unity against the remnants of sectarianism-dogmatism, especially against revisionism domestically and internationally. Recently, our people have made great achievements in both industry and agriculture. The people of our country are determined to speed up socialist construction. The Hungarian people will also do their utmost to continue to strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp.

    新华社布达佩斯25日电　中国党政代表团团长朱德副主席和代表团团员习仲勋，在25日上午乘飞机离布达佩斯回国。
    到机场欢送的有：匈牙利党政领导人明尼赫、马罗山、罗奈伊、基什、卡拉伊、福克、比斯库、费赫尔等，以及群众团体的代表。到机场送行的还有我国驻匈牙利大使郝德青和各国驻匈牙利外交使节。
    朱德副主席在明尼赫总理陪同下检阅了仪仗队之后，向欢送的群众讲了话。
    朱副主席在对匈牙利党和政府以及匈牙利人民热烈的欢迎和亲切的接待表示衷心的感谢后说，我们充分体会到，这种友好的表示体现着匈牙利人民对中国人民的兄弟情谊和友好精神，我们对此非常感动，并愿将这种深厚的友情转达给中国人民。朱德副主席接着说，在我们同你们一起欢度具有革命意义的节日期间，亲自看到匈牙利人民在以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的正确领导下，在巩固无产阶级专政、在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了辉煌的成就，特别是农业合作化方面出现了空前未有的发展。这些都给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    朱副主席说，具有传统的革命斗争精神的匈牙利工人阶级和广大人民群众，都拥护和积极支持社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的政治路线和政策方针，紧密地团结在党和政府周围，满怀信心地正在社会主义建设的道路上以坚定而快速的步伐向前迈进，我们为此感到无限欢欣和鼓舞。我们深信，匈牙利人民今后在社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业中，将会不断取得新的更大的胜利。团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中的中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊和合作，必将日益加强和发展。
    明尼赫总理在讲话中说，苏联和社会主义阵营其它国家、以及中国同志们对我们的支持，给了我们的斗争以巨大的力量。我国劳动人民从苏维埃共和国的失败和1956年反革命事件中吸取了经验教训。现在，年轻人和老战士们一起坚定地保卫着人民政权。他强调说，我们的党通过坚定的工作，已消除了反革命暴乱所造成的思想上的混乱，在钢铁般的团结下与宗派—教条主义的残余，特别是在国内和国际范围内同修正主义进行着斗争。最近，我国人民在工业和农业方面都取得了很大的成就。我国人民决心加快速度进行社会主义建设。匈牙利人民并将尽自己的最大努力来继续加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量。
