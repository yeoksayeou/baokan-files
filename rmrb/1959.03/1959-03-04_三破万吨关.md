Breaking the 10,000-Ton Barrier Three Times
Wang Shiying, Secretary of the CCP Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Primary Rolling Mill Committee

It was a cold spring night, stars twinkling in the sky. People flocked from all directions to the victory celebration. Gongs and drums sounded in front, firecrackers popped behind, and waves of cheers echoed for a long time.

The loudspeaker began to speak. It was the same loudspeaker, but today its voice was particularly clear and loud—it was announcing the birth of another new record. Sound waves reverberated in the night sky, sending the first triumphant song of the new spring from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Primary Rolling Mill—the victorious results of the third "10,000-Ton Battle"—in all directions.

The "10,000-Ton Battle" is not unfamiliar to us rolling mill workers. Last November, the Party Committee put forward the battle slogan of "Hard work for half a year, roll six hundred (ingots) per shift, roll 10,000 tons (of raw material) per day, turn one mill into two." It required, within half a year, on the basis of the existing equipment, to vigorously launch mass movements, and make great technical revolutions, so that the output would reach twice the average level of June 1958. In December, we successively organized two "10,000-Ton Battles" and achieved the goal of "rolling 10,000 tons per day" ahead of schedule.

After the New Year, when the Party Committee deployed the third "10,000-Ton Battle" at the cadre meeting, all the workers in the mill were truly confident and high-spirited. The "10,000-Ton Battle" was like a red thread, running through the hearts of every worker.

Look at those young men in the raw material assault team, their faces beaming with excitement, their eyes shining, and their cotton-padded jackets unbuttoned. They said, "We must ensure that the soaking pits are well-fed and well-nourished." This sentence went straight to the hearts of the soaking pit workers. —It turned out that since the Great Leap Forward last year, the furnace's steel heating capacity has doubled. What the soaking pit workers worried about was the shortage of raw steel ingots. The guarantee of the raw material assault team greatly encouraged the soaking pit workers who were discussing measures. They immediately put forward the battle slogan of "Double the hot ingots, and advance the cold ingots." This echoing response gave the workers of the primary rolling mill even greater confidence. The rolling operators said, "Let's do it! With your support, we guarantee to roll as much as you heat!"

On the side of the primary rolling mill, the flag of command rose up. The machinery roared. Swallowing steel ingots, spitting out steel billets, one fiery dragon after another sped north on the roller table.

At the beginning of the second work shift, the dispatch chart reflected that there would be waiting for heat. The shift director, Old Han, was sweating profusely, constantly muttering, "Tough! Tough!" The dispatch director also pouted, feeling that waiting for heat and stopping rolling was inevitable. In the dispatch room, many eyes looked at the leaders, eagerly awaiting new action orders. At this time, Chen Fu-kuan, the soaking pit branch secretary, reminded Old Han to remain calm and seek solutions from the masses. At the same time, he personally organized the operators of each soaking pit to carry out emergency mobilization: requiring everyone to do everything possible to speed up the steel heating speed. After analysis and research: if furnace No. 11 could be released a few tens of minutes earlier, it might be possible to eliminate waiting for heat. The key was found, but everyone was still a little worried: because Liu Feng-ying, the furnace chief of No. 11, used to be a famous "old conservative." Could he heat the steel well in advance? Technician Quan Ting-ren volunteered to study measures with Old Liu. As soon as he introduced the situation to Old Liu, before he could say anything else, Old Liu抢着 said, "Come on! I guarantee to heat the steel well an hour and a half in advance!"

Liu Feng-ying lived up to expectations, he heated the steel ingots ahead of schedule and ensured that the ingot temperature was suitable for rolling.

The tense battle continued…

The soaking pits felt the shortage of raw materials again. The danger of waiting for heat was imminent. There were still fourteen pans of hot steel ingots in the steel ingot stripping plant, but there was no locomotive.

The raw material assault team immediately asked the steel ingot plant dispatch room for help. With great difficulty, they got a No. 39 locomotive. However, to pull fourteen pans of heavy hot steel ingots over the slope and into the factory building, two locomotives were required. Where to find another one?

The veteran driver of No. 39 looked at the anxious faces of the assault team members and replied without hesitation, "There is a way! In order to support the '10,000-Ton Battle,' the locomotive must also muster its strength and break the routine!"

No sooner said than done. The No. 39 locomotive spewed thick smoke, pulling the long line of fourteen pans of hot steel ingots, doing its best, and finally pulled the fourteen pans of ingots over the slope and delivered the ingots to the primary rolling mill in time.

The third "10,000-Ton Battle" ended victoriously with a record high of 10,972 tons of steel ingots rolled per day.

10,972 tons! This figure marks that the production level of the First Primary Rolling Mill has increased by 94.4% compared with June last year.

How much thought and effort, how many sleepless nights, and how much hard work were spent for rolling 10,000 tons per day! When the heroic people talked and laughed, recounting one by one the passes and obstacles that had been leveled and broken through, when the steel warriors looked into the distance, displaying the greater victory of tomorrow, the lights in the Party Committee office burned late into the night, and newer and greater leap forward plans were being discussed in a heated atmosphere:

"Work hard for fifty days to completely realize 'turning one mill into two'." All the workers are marching forward with full confidence along the direction pointed out by the Party!

    三破万吨关
    中共鞍钢第一初轧厂委员会书记  王士英
    这是一个初春的寒夜，天边繁星闪烁，人群从四面八方涌向祝捷的会场。前边锣鼓响，后面鞭炮鸣，欢呼的声浪久久不能平息。
    扩音器开始说话了。还是那个扩音器，今天的嗓门特别嘹亮、清脆，——它在宣布又一个新纪录的诞生。声波在夜空回旋，把鞍钢第一初轧厂新春的第一曲凯歌——第三次“万吨大战”的胜利战果，送向四方。
    “万吨大战”对我们轧钢工人说来并不生疏。去年11月党委提出
  “苦干半年，班轧六百（块），日轧万吨（原料），一厂变两厂”的战斗口号。要求在半年内，在原有设备基础上，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，使产量达到1958年6月份平均水平的一倍。我们在12月里就先后两次组织了“万吨大战”，提前实现了“日轧万吨”的目标。
    过了年，党委在干部会议上又部署第三次“万吨大战”的时候，全厂职工真是信心百倍，斗志昂扬，
  “万吨大战”就像一根红线一样，贯穿着每个职工的心。
    你看那原料突击队的小伙子们，脸上带着兴奋的神色，两眼熠熠发光，棉袄的扣子也撇开了。他们说：“一定保证均热炉吃得饱，吃得好。”这句话，正道入了均热工人的心坎。——原来从去年大跃进以来，炉子的烧钢能力翻了番，均热工人所担心的就是原料钢锭不足。原料突击队的保证给正在讨论措施的均热工人以极大的鼓舞。他们马上提出了“热锭再翻番，冷锭再提前”的战斗口号。这一呼一应，使初轧机的工人信心更大了。压延操作手们说：“干吧！有你们的支援，我们保证烧多少，轧多少。”
    初轧机侧升起了督阵的帅字大旗。机械在轰鸣。吞钢锭，吐钢坯，一根根的火龙在辊道上向北奔驰着。
    在第二个工作班开始的时候，调度图表上反映出将会待热。值班主任老韩，急得满头大汗，不断在叨咕：“够呛！够呛！”调度主任也撅着嘴，觉得待热停轧已在所难免。调度室里，多少人的眼睛看着领导，急切地等待着新的行动号令。这时均热支部书记陈富宽一面提醒老韩：要沉住气，找群众想办法。一面亲自组织各均热炉的操作手进行紧急动员：要求大家想尽一切办法来加快烧钢速度。经过分析研究：如果十一号炉能提前几十分钟出炉，就有可能消灭待热。关键找到了，但大家还是有几分担心：因为十一号炉的炉长刘凤营过去是个有名的“老保守”，他能不能提前把钢烧好呢？技术员全廷仁自报奋勇去和老刘共同研究措施。他刚向老刘介绍完情况，还没有来得及说别的，老刘就抢着说：“来吧！保证提前一个半小时把钢烧好！”
    刘凤营果然没有辜负众望，他提前烧好了钢锭并保证了钢锭温度适合轧制的要求。
    紧张的战斗在持续着……
    均热炉又感到原料不足了。待热的危险迫在眉睫。钢锭脱模厂里还有十四盘热钢锭，可就是没有火车头。
    原料突击队员们马上向钢锭厂调度室求救。好容易才弄到一台三十九号机车。可是，要把十四盘沉重的热钢锭牵过坡道，送入厂房，却必须有两台机车才能胜任。到哪儿去找另一台呢？
    三十九号老司机瞧着突击队员们焦急的脸色，毫不迟疑地回答说：“有办法！为了支援‘万吨大战’，火车头也得鼓足干劲，打破常规！”
    说干就干。三十九号火车头吐着浓烟，牵引着长长的十四盘热钢锭，竭尽全力，终于把十四盘钢锭拉过坡道，把钢锭及时送到了初轧厂。
    第三次“万吨大战”以日轧钢锭一万零九百七十二吨的最高纪录胜利结束。
    一万零九百七十二吨！这个数字标志着第一初轧厂的生产水平比去年6月份提高了94.4％。
    为了日轧万吨，费尽了多少心机，经历了多少不眠的夜晚，流过了多少辛勤的汗水！当英雄的人们谈笑风生地细数着一个个被踏平和被突破的雄关隘道的时候，当钢铁战士们举目远眺，展视着更大胜利的明天的时候，党委办公室的灯光，深夜不熄，更新更大的跃进方案又在热烈的气氛中讨论着：
    “苦干五十天，彻底实现‘一厂变两厂’”。全体职工，正满怀信心地沿着党所指引的方向，高歌猛进！
