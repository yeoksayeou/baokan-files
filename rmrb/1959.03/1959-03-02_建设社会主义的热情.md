Enthusiasm for Building Socialism
Zhu Shiqing

Spring has arrived in Poland. Although the weather is still quite cold, people's hearts are warm. Whether in cities or villages, factories or mines, offices or schools, the enthusiasm for building socialism is burning in people's hearts. The entire nation is contributing its share to the Polish United Workers' Party Third Congress, which will convene on March 10.

Inspiring Call

The decision to convene the Polish United Workers' Party Third Congress was made at the Party's Second Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee in mid-October last year. At this plenary session, three documents were also passed: the draft directives for Poland's development from 1959 to 1965, the Party's policy directives in rural areas, and the draft revisions to the Party Constitution. These serve as the basic topics for the Third Congress agenda. The convening of the Party's Third Congress is a major event in the political life of the Polish people. After the documents were published, the entire party and the entire nation immediately launched heated discussions. Comrade Gomulka, First Secretary of the Party Central Committee, pointed out at the plenary session that "not only party members, but also the people" are paying attention to the congress; the road mapped out by the party "is not only the party's road, but also the road of the working class, all working people, and the entire nation." He issued a call to the people of the whole country to "greet the Third Congress with labor." The call was like a spring thunder, resounding throughout Poland. From the Bug River to the Oder-Neisse line, from the Tatra Mountains to the Baltic Sea, the Polish people launched a magnificent movement throughout the country to dedicate themselves to the Party's Third Congress.

Welcoming the "Third Congress" with Action

The working class is at the forefront of the movement. From the newspapers, one can see their fighting determination and achievements every day, truly reporting good news frequently. At the beginning of February, we visited the Warsaw Steel Plant, Poland's first steel plant producing high-quality steel, which is under construction. From afar, we could see the large red characters "Welcome the Third Congress with Action" on the roof of the factory building at the construction site. The main content of the workers' dedications (here called "undertaking obligations") includes: tapping production potential, increasing labor productivity, increasing targets and tasks, reducing costs, improving quality, improving labor organization, and carrying out technological reforms. Thanks to the dedication movement, the fulfillment of the production plan for the fourth quarter of last year was fully guaranteed, and many factories overfulfilled their plans; the production targets for January this year were also exceeded in most factories, completing the plans ahead of schedule. Provinces and cities all plan to increase production by hundreds of millions of zlotys (Polish currency) as gifts, such as the agricultural region of Rzeszów Province, which plans to increase production by nearly 700 million zlotys. The twenty-two provinces and cities (seventeen provinces and five cities) across the country will create more than 10 billion zlotys worth of wealth for the country and the people before the "Third Congress." Technical personnel in factories have played a significant role in technological reforms. After the dedication movement began, labor discipline was strengthened, attendance rates increased, and labor competitions were gradually carried out. For example, at the Piotrków Trybunalski Province train carriage repair factory, 90% of the employees participated in the competition, forming more than 300 production shock teams. Rationalization proposals have also surged; the workers in Wrocław Province put forward more than 12,000 proposals, the implementation of which will increase light industry production by 20% over the original plan in seven years, and the 1959 plan will be able to be greatly overfulfilled. The workers in Katowice Province, known as the "industrial heart of Poland," put forward more than 20,000 proposals. Preliminary statistics show that the implementation of these proposals will increase the country's wealth by more than 5 billion zlotys.

The forms of dedication are diverse. In rural areas, such as consolidating and promoting the cooperative movement, rectifying agricultural groups, improving the management of state-owned farms, carrying out land improvement, and building roads and bridges. In addition, the young workers' organization, "Youth Day," young students go to the western recovered territories to give lectures, help popularize culture, and participate in various social voluntary labor activities. To welcome the "Third Congress," doctors went to the countryside one after another, and designated February 22 as "Doctors to the Countryside Day" to provide medical services to the villagers. The renowned "Mazowsze" National Folk Song and Dance Ensemble gave touring performances in various places, allowing more working people to enjoy...

Cooperatives are Advancing

Comrade Gomulka pointed out at the Twelfth Plenary Session that "the socialist transformation of the countryside is the only way to develop agriculture." The Party's policy directives in rural areas have aroused heated discussions in the countryside. Recently, celebrations of the tenth anniversary of agricultural production cooperativization in Poland have been held in various places. The economic results achieved by agricultural production cooperatives in 1958 clearly demonstrated the superiority of cooperativization. Last year, the average yield of four types of grains in cooperatives reached 2.05 metric tons per hectare, more than 0.5 metric tons higher than the national average yield. Some cooperatives even achieved yields of 2.5 to 3 metric tons per hectare. Members' incomes have increased, and cooperatives' investments have also increased.

The superiority of cooperatives attracts farmers. During the income distribution process in 1958, more than 300 farmers applied to join cooperatives. By the end of last year, there were more than 1,850 cooperatives across the country, more than 50 of which were established after the Twelfth Plenary Session. Dozens more were established in January this year, with 18 in Poznan Province alone, and seven in Opole Province. A cooperative was established in the Avaika area, named "Third Congress." It can be seen that the production cooperativization of Poland's countryside is constantly advancing. As Wojciech, Secretary of the Kielce Provincial Party Committee, said, "The future of Poland's countryside is the countryside of cooperatives, which is an objective necessity."

The Whole Nation Runs Schools

The whole nation running schools is also an important part of the Polish people's movement to welcome the "Third Congress." The Polish United Workers' Party proposed building a thousand new schools in urban and rural areas to celebrate the millennium of Polish statehood. The Twelfth Plenary Session made this slogan more specific: raising 1 billion zlotys in funds for school construction before the "Third Congress." This slogan has been widely praised and enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of the people, and is being transformed into action in various places. The slogans and banners of "Building a Thousand Schools" are everywhere.

Workers and farmers in their own factories and rural areas are responding to the call with their own labor and funds. Especially in rural areas, farmers are using local materials, engaging in large-scale construction, burning ash, digging stones, surveying, and building, all managed by themselves. Architects are actively designing typical patterns for them. Some workers work overtime and give up rest. For example, miners in Silesia and dockworkers in Gdansk also work on Sundays, contributing all the output value to this movement. Young students actively participate in labor in response to this call, and athletes increase the number of performances and competitions, donating all the income.

In short, the whole nation is mobilized. School buildings will blossom all over the beautiful Polish land.

At present, the movement to dedicate gifts to the Party's "Third Congress" is in full swing. The whole country is connected with the "Third Congress," paying close attention to the convening of this congress. The people expect the "Third Congress" to guide them more quickly towards a better tomorrow. (Attached picture)

    建设社会主义的热情
    朱士清
    春天已经来到了波兰。虽然天气还比较寒冷，但是人们心里却是暖融融的。无论是城市还是乡村，工厂还是矿井，机关还是学校，建设社会主义的热情，燃烧着人们的心，全国人民都在为即将于3月10日召开的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会贡献自己的一分力量。
      鼓舞人心的号召
    波兰统一工人党召开第三次党代表大会的决定是在去年10月中旬举行的党二届十二中全会上通过的。在这次全会上，还通过了关于1959—1965年波兰发展的指示草案、党在农村中的政策指示，以及党章修改草案等三个文件，作为第三次代表大会议程的基本题目。党的第三次代表大会的召开是波兰人民政治生活中的一件大事。文件公布后，全党全民立即就展开了热烈的讨论。党中央第一书记哥穆尔卡同志在全会上指出，注意代表大会的“不但有党员，而且有人民”；党拟定的道路“不只是党的道路，也是工人阶级、全体劳动人民和全国人民的道路。”他向全国人民发出了“以劳动来迎接第三次代表大会”的号召。号召犹如一声春雷，响澈了全波兰。从布格河到奥得尼斯河，从塔塔尔山到波罗的海，波兰人民在全国各地掀起了波澜壮阔的向党的第三次代表大会献礼的运动。
      以行动迎接“三大”
    工人阶级走在运动的前列。从报纸上天天可以看到他们的战斗决心和战果，真是喜报频传。2月初，我们参观了正在建造中的波兰第一座生产优质钢的华沙钢铁厂，远远地就可看到工地的厂房顶上“以行动迎接三大”的大红字。工人们献礼（这里叫做“承担义务”）的主要内容有：发掘生产潜力，提高劳动生产率，增加指标和任务，降低成本、提高质量，改善劳动组织和进行技术改革等等。由于献礼运动，去年第四季度生产计划的完成得到了充分的保证，而且许多工厂都超额完成了计划；今年1月份的生产指标在大部分的工厂里又被突破，提前完成了计划。各省市都计划以增加数亿兹罗提（波币名）的生产作为礼物，如农业地区的热苏夫省就计划增加生产近七亿兹罗提，全国二十二个省市（十七省五市）在“三大”前将为国家和人民创造百亿兹罗提以上的财富。工厂的技术人员在技术改革方面起了不小的作用。献礼运动展开后，劳动纪律加强了，出勤率提高了，劳动竞赛也在逐步开展。如彼得哥煦省火车车厢修理工厂，90％的职工参加了竞赛，成立三百多个生产突击队。合理化建议也有如潮涌，伏罗茨瓦夫省的工人们提出了一万二千多件建议，这些建议的实现将使轻工业的生产在七年中较原计划增加20％，同时1959年的计划将完全能大大超额完成。被称为“波兰工业心脏”的卡托维兹省的工人们提出了二万多件建议，初步统计，这些建议的实现将为国家增加五十多亿兹罗提的财富。
    献礼的形式是多种多样的。在农村中，如巩固和宣传合作化运动，整顿农业小组，改进国营农场的经营，进行土地改良，修建道路和桥梁等。此外，青年工人组织“青年日”，青年学生去西部收复地区讲课，帮助普及文化，并参加各种社会性的义务劳动。医生为了迎接“三大”，纷纷下乡，并把2月22日订为“医生下乡日”，为老乡们治病服务。享有盛誉的“玛佐夫舍”国家歌舞团在各地作巡回演出，供更多的劳动人民欣赏……。
        合作化在前进中
    哥穆尔卡同志在十二中全会上指出，“农村的社会主义改造是发展农业的唯一道路”。党在农村中的政策指示在农村中引起了热烈的讨论。最近，各地都在举行庆祝波兰农业生产合作化十周年的活动。1958年农业生产合作社所取得的经济效果，显著地表明了合作化的优越性。合作社去年四种谷物的平均产量，每公顷达到二十点五公担，较全国平均产量高五公担多，有的合作社每公顷达到二十五甚至三十公担的产量。社员的收入有了提高，合作社的投资也有了增加。
    合作社的优越性吸引着农民。在进行1958年收入分配的过程中，就有三百多个农民申请加入了合作社。到去年年底，全国共有一千八百五十多个合作社，其中在十二中全会后就成立了五十多个。今年1月份又成立了好几十个，仅波兹南一省就成立了十八个，奥波莱省七个。在阿瓦依卡地方成立了一个合作社，取名为“三大”。可以看到，波兰农村的生产合作化在不断前进中。正如凯尔采省委书记伏依契克说的那样，“波兰农村的明天是合作社的农村，这是客观的必要性。”
      全民都来办学校
    全民都来办学校也是波兰人民迎接“三大”运动的重要内容之一。波兰统一工人党提出在城乡建立一千所新学校来庆祝波兰建国一千周年。十二中全会把这一口号提得更具体了：在“三大”前为建设学校募集十亿兹罗提资金。这个口号得到广大人民的普遍称赞和热烈支持，正在各地变为行动。“建设一千所学校”的口号和标语，处处皆是。
    工人和农民在自己的工厂和农村里，正以自己的劳动和资金响应号召，特别是在农村中，农民们就地取材，大兴土木，烧灰、掘石、测量、建造，全由自己包管。建筑师们积极地为之设计典型图样。有的工人们则加班生产，放弃休息，例如西里西亚的矿工和革但斯克的码头工人星期日也都上班，把全部产值都贡献给这个运动。青年学生们为了响应这一号召而积极地参加劳动，运动员们增加表演比赛的场数，把收入全部捐出。
    总之，全民都动起来了。学校建筑将在美丽的波兰国土上遍地开花。
    目前，向党的“三大”献礼的运动正在热火朝天地进行着，举国上下都和“三大”连系在一起，关注地瞩望着这次代表大会的召开。人民期待着“三大”将更快地指引他们奔向美好的明天。（附图片）
