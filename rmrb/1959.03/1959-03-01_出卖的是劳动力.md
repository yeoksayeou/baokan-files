    What is Sold is Labor Power

    Cui Qi's article "Curses Cannot Overthrow Truth" on the fourth page of the February 16th People's Daily is a good article. It lists rich facts and gives Dulles a powerful rebuttal.

    However, the phrase "workers 'freely' sell their labor to capitalists" in the third paragraph of the third section is incorrect. Marx said that wages under the capitalist system are the price of the labor power of wage laborers. What workers sell to capitalists is labor power, not labor. However, wages under the capitalist system conceal this truth, as if wages are the price of labor. Therefore, the above statement is incorrect.

### 出卖的是劳动力

    出卖的是劳动力
    2月16日人民日报第四版上崔奇同志所写“咒骂推翻不了真理”，是一篇好文章。它列举了丰富的事实，给杜勒斯以有力的驳斥。
    但是，第三部分第三段中“工人们‘自由地’把自己的劳动出卖给资本家”一语有错误。马克思说过，资本主义制度下的工资，是雇佣劳动者的劳动力的价格，工人出卖给资本家的，是劳动力，而不是劳动；但资本主义制度下的工资掩盖了这一真相，好像工资是劳动的价格。因此上面的说法是不正确的。　　　　　　广州　张汉青
