Main Focus – The Jointing Stage

Currently, it is the jointing stage of wheat, which is also the main time to ensure more and larger wheat ears. Providing the wheat with sufficient nutrition – water and fertilizer – during this period is key to high yield and is the main focus of current wheat field management.

Yangzhong County, according to the needs of wheat jointing and booting, is mobilizing the entire party and all the people to massively produce and apply phosphate and potash fertilizers; Henan is building water conservancy projects to prepare for universal irrigation during the jointing stage. These practices are all timely. "Timeliness" is particularly important for crop growth. Only by meeting the needs of crops in a timely manner can we achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is one of the important conditions for ensuring high yields.

    主攻方向——拔节关
    目前正是麦子拔节阶段，也是保证小麦穗多穗大的主要时刻。这一时期给予麦子充足的营养——水和肥，是高产的关键，也是当前小麦田间管理的主攻方向。
    扬中县根据小麦拔节孕穗的需要，全党全民大造大施磷钾肥；河南兴修水利工程，准备普浇拔节水。这些做法都是适时的。“适时”，对农作物的生长特别重要，只有适时地满足农作物的需要，才能收到事半功倍之效。这是保证高产的重要条件之一。
