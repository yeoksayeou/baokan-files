Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 14th.  Ochab, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report on "The Party's Instructions on Rural Policy" at the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on the afternoon of March 14th.

In his report, he pointed out that the current agricultural policy of the Party is to continuously increase agricultural and livestock production, improve the production indicators of state-owned farms, pave the way for gradually realizing socialist transformation in the countryside, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

Ochab said that during the period from 1959 to 1965, the total output of the four main grains will increase from 13.5 million tons to 15.6 million tons, potatoes from 34.8 million tons to 44 million tons, and the total output value of the entire agriculture will increase by about 30% in seven years.

The reporter pointed out that in the five years from the Second Congress to the Third Congress of the Party, the total agricultural output value increased by 25%, of which the output value of commodity production increased by 36%. Almost all agricultural land has been cultivated, and the labor productivity of each agricultural population has increased by an average of one-fold compared to the pre-war period. The grain harvest per hectare from 1955 to 1958 was 14.5 quintals, an increase of 3 quintals compared to the average harvest in the last few years before the war.

Ochab pointed out that due to the increase in Poland's exports of various agricultural products, we are now not only able to completely offset the value of grain imports, but also have a surplus in foreign trade of agricultural products.

He then said that our plan to develop agriculture requires increased investment in various sectors of agriculture. From 1956 to 1958, our appropriation for agricultural investment was about 37 billion zlotys, while in the seven-year plan, the investment will be 129 billion zlotys, including state investment and farmers' own investment. The plan stipulates that 16 billion zlotys will be used to improve soil, about 75 billion zlotys will be used for construction projects to develop animal husbandry, and 32 billion zlotys will be used for agricultural mechanization.

The reporter said that the instructions for developing agriculture require increasing the yield per unit area of the four grains, and the average yield per hectare should reach 17.5 quintals by 1965. If we note that the population will increase to more than 32 million and that agricultural product imports must be maintained at a higher level than now, then the task after completion is still strenuous.

When talking about the development of state-owned farms, he pointed out that in 1958, the commodity production of state-owned farms increased by 18.2% compared with 1956, the number of agricultural workers employed decreased by 17.4% during this period, and the number of staff members decreased by 41%. The average wage of workers increased by 19% compared with 1956.

These figures show that the deficits of state-owned farms nationwide can be eliminated in the past year.

Ochab then talked about the agricultural production cooperativization movement. He said that by December 1958, the number of cooperatives was 1,718, and the labor results of these cooperatives should be considered good. The harvest of the four main grains per hectare of cooperatives averaged 2.6 quintals higher than that of individual farmers. In some cooperatives in the Province of Bydgoszcz, the remuneration for a labor day increased from 45.3 zlotys in 1956 to 91.1 zlotys, an increase of more than one-fold. In order to further improve the economic indicators of cooperatives and thus further demonstrate the superiority of the collective economy over the individual economy, we should pay special attention to the development of public animal husbandry in cooperatives and expand its construction.

He emphasized that our policy is to build a socialist system in urban and rural areas and build a classless society. The people's regime will systematically help production cooperatives and other collective forms of activity of farmers.

The reporter pointed out that in order to help production cooperatives, the state will give them preferential treatment in agricultural tax and compulsory sales. The Party now and in the future will fight against the revisionist "theorists" who oppose production cooperativization. The development of agricultural production cooperatives is the law of socialist construction and the fundamental condition for the rapid development of rural economy and culture.

Then the reporter emphasized that the development of production cooperatives should be carried out in accordance with the farmers' own will, and the principle of voluntariness should not be violated. He said that production cooperatives are the future of the Polish countryside. However, we cannot, like dogmatists, hope to use administrative measures to accelerate the development of this movement.

Ochab then pointed out that the state's multifaceted assistance should be combined with giving play to social and economic initiative in rural areas. Agricultural groups should complete a major task in this regard.

When talking about rural economic issues and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, Ochab pointed out that the policy of the people's state is conducive to the increase of agricultural production and the improvement of the living standards of farmers. He said that in the years of the people's regime, profound changes have taken place in the class relations in the Polish countryside. He pointed out that the main component of the countryside at present is the middle peasant, who provides most of the commodities. Of course, this does not mean that we can ignore the interests of the poor peasants. Although the number of poor peasants is decreasing day by day. He said that our Party's policy is to support middle and small peasants and to fight against the speculative and exploitative tendencies of rich peasants.

When talking about the tasks of rural Party organizations, Ochab said that the peasant masses increasingly regard them as their friends, advisors and leaders, and the prestige of rural Party organizations has increased.

When talking about the tasks of millions of individual farmers voluntarily transferring to collective socialist farms, completing the output targets of the seven-year plan, and establishing cooperatives and socialist countryside, Ochab said that there is no doubt that we can complete these tasks. Because we have the Marxist-Leninist theory as a guide, because we can make use of the experience of fraternal communist parties, and because we have given revisionists and dogmatists a resolute blow. We have united our ranks with a correct political program.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 14th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued its meeting this morning to discuss the reports of Gomulka and Indrikhovsky. A total of eleven people spoke at the morning meeting.

Zawadzki, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party and Chairman of the State Council, spoke first. He mainly talked about the issue of the Party and the Party's position and leading role in the National Front. He said that the Party is holding the congress in an atmosphere of unity, the Party is aware of its tasks and responsibilities, the Party is firmly united with the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas, and has won the trust of the working people.

When talking about the work of the National Front, he said that for many years this front has embodied the active participation of the broad masses of working people in the country's social and political life. The Polish United Workers' Party and the United Peasant Party, as well as other fraternal parties, jointly realize the ideological and political leadership of this front.

Zawadzki emphasized that Lenin's theory is the most important content of socialist democracy. Lenin said that millions, and then gradually the whole society, should be made to participate in the management of the country under the ideological and political leadership of the Party, to develop autonomous social forms in which the initiative, talent, creativity and selflessness of the masses can be most effectively developed. He said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party took a big step forward on the road to forming conditions for the development of socialist democracy in our country. Forming these conditions is to serve the cause of socialist construction more effectively.

Zawadzki said that the people's state and socialist democracy are based on the unconditional and principled observance of the rule of law. He also said that in order to prevent the influence of reactionaries and revisionists on democratic groups and institutions, it is necessary to take administrative measures against troublemakers who do not correct their mistakes and to further improve the society's political awareness and socialist patriotism. He pointed out that it is urgently necessary to conduct socialist influence on the ideological and political content of many areas of life in the spirit of the Party's ideology.

Zawadzki then pointed out that the thorough eradication of all bad signs and tendencies to distort the Party's line, as well as the firm will to prevent the revival of the roots that produce such distortions, will be the guarantee for the realization of the resolutions of the Third Congress.

Zawadzki finally talked about using the history of the Polish workers' revolutionary movement and proletarian internationalism to train cadres and strengthen the Party's ranks.

Also speaking at the morning meeting were Maleritzki, Chairman of the Science and Technology Commission, and Kainchi, a representative of a district in Warsaw.

The head of the Vietnamese Labor Party delegation, Wu Yuanjia, member of the Central Political Bureau, addressed the congress with a congratulatory message and presented a banner, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

In his congratulatory message, Wu Yuanjia condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in attempting to turn South Vietnam into a military base and instigating the South Vietnamese authorities to slaughter patriots. He expressed his gratitude to Poland for its great role in assisting the implementation of the Indochina Armistice Agreement. Finally, he wished Poland greater achievements in opposing revisionism and dogmatism, consolidating the solidarity of the socialist camp, and maintaining European security.

The head of the German Communist Party delegation said in his congratulatory message that Adenauer is very resentful of the great achievements of socialist countries. He rejected the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and carried out revanchist propaganda in the country. We, the German Communists, will unite the entire working class and all democratic forces to fight for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and against the Adenauer regime.

Minister of Coal Mining and Power Industry Waniouka talked about Poland's vigorous increase in the production of lignite, while also increasing the production of oil and natural gas.

Woijas, First Secretary of the Opole Provincial Committee, spoke in detail about the great achievements made by the province in the past fourteen years. When talking about agricultural issues, he said that an important factor in increasing agricultural production is the development of agricultural cooperatives. Now the harvest of the four grains per hectare of agricultural cooperatives in Opole Province has reached 20.4 quintals, which should become the main argument for persuading farmers to be convinced of the superiority of cooperatives.

The head of the Algerian Communist Party delegation said in his speech that the establishment of the Algerian government reflects the people's wishes. Our country wanted to negotiate with the de Gaulle government to stop the war, but the de Gaulle government unreasonably refused. Therefore, the responsibility for continuing the war should be borne by the de Gaulle government. We will unite with the people of Arab countries and fight together for national independence.

Then, the heads of the Austrian and Finnish Communist Party delegations addressed the congress with congratulatory messages respectively.

The speeches of all heads of foreign fraternal party delegations were warmly welcomed.

The morning meeting ended here, and the meeting will continue in the afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 14th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued its meeting on the afternoon of March 14th.

The meeting first listened to the report of Ochab, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, on the Party's rural policy.

Tomaszewski, First Secretary of the Olsztyn Provincial Committee, spoke after Ochab's report. He said that after discussing the seven-year development instructions, the forty factories and enterprises in Olsztyn Province have all raised their production targets.

Tomaszewski said that the Party's policies have been warmly supported by the Polish people. A good proof is that 90% of the employees in the enterprises of Olsztyn Province participated in the production competition before the congress. When talking about the country's economic construction, the speaker especially emphasized that attention should be paid to the development of the western region.

Also speaking at the meeting was Kopeć, a representative of an agricultural production cooperative in Wangemin, Warsaw Province. At the afternoon meeting, the heads of the three fraternal party delegations from Spain, Brazil and Iceland addressed the congress with congratulatory messages.

Alvarez, head of the Spanish Communist Party delegation, said that people from all walks of life in Spain are increasingly dissatisfied with Franco's dictatorship. If all domestic democratic forces unite, Franco's dictatorial rule will not last long.

Alvarez asked the Polish people to support the democratic struggle movement that Spain will launch on May 5th this year. He finally said that our party has corrected the mistakes of dogmatism and sectarianism, and has also carried out the struggle against revisionism.

The head of the Brazilian Communist Party delegation said in his speech that to strive for our economic independence, we must have a peaceful diplomatic policy. We are fighting for Brazil to establish contact with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China.

Hergason, head of the Icelandic United Socialist Party delegation, then addressed the congress. He condemned the British for sending warships to openly sabotage Iceland's legitimate right to declare its fishing zone to be twelve nautical miles. He also said that the people of our country demand that the U.S. troops withdraw from our country, which is not only for ourselves, but also for international peace.

The speeches of the three fraternal party delegation heads were warmly welcomed by the participants.

The March 14th meeting ended here. On the 15th, the congress will be adjourned for one day. Fraternal party delegations from eight countries, including Albania, Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam, will visit Krakow on this day.

    奥哈布在波兰党代会上作关于农村政策的报告
    不断提高农牧生产逐步实现社会主义改造
    越南等六个国家的兄弟党代表向大会致贺词
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员奥哈布14日下午在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会上作了“党在农村政策的指示”的报告。
    他在报告中指出，党的当前农业政策的方针是：不断提高农业和畜牧业生产，提高国营农场的生产指标，为在农村中逐步实现社会主义改造开辟道路并加强工农联盟。
    奥哈布说，在1959年到1965年期间，四种主要谷物的总产量将从一千三百五十万吨增加到一千五百六十万吨，马铃薯从三千四百八十万吨增加到四千四百万吨，七年中整个农业的总产值将增加约30％。
    报告人指出，在党的第二次代表大会到第三次代表大会的五年期间，农业总产值增加了25％，其中商品生产的产值增加了36％。几乎所有的农业用地都已开垦，每一个农业人口的劳动生产率平均比战前时期增加了一倍。1955—1958年的每公顷谷物收获量为十四点五公担，比战前最后几年的平均收获量增加了三公担。
    奥哈布指出，由于波兰各种农产品出口的增加，现在我们不仅能完全抵消谷物进口的价值，而且在农产品的对外贸易方面还有顺差。
    他接着说，我们发展农业的计划要求对农业各部门增加投资。在1956到1958年，我们对农业投资的拨款约为三百七十亿兹罗提，而在七年计划中，投资将为一千二百九十亿兹罗提，其中包括国家投资和农民自己的投资。计划规定，要用一百六十亿兹罗提来改良土壤，约七百五十亿兹罗提用于发展畜牧业方面的建设工程，三百二十亿兹罗提用于农业机械化。
    报告人说，发展农业的指示要求提高四种谷物的单位面积产量，到1965年每公顷土地的平均产量要达到十七点五公担。如果注意到人口将增加到三千二百万以上和还必须把农产品的进口保持在比现在为高的水平上，那么，这个任务完成后也还是紧张的。
    他在谈到国营农场的发展情况时指出，1958年国营农场商品生产比1956年增加了18.2％，就业的农业工人的数目在这一时期中减少了17.4％，职员人数减少了41％。工人平均工资比1956年提高了19％。
    这些数字说明，最近一年可以消灭全国国营农场的赤字。
    奥哈布接着谈到了农业生产合作化运动。他说，到1958年12月合作社的数目是一千七百一十八个，这些合作社的劳动成果应当认为是良好的。合作社四种主要谷物的收获量每公顷平均比个体农民高二点六公担。在比得哥煦省的一些合作社，劳动日的报酬从1956年的四十五点三兹罗提提高到九十一点一兹罗提，即增加了一倍以上。为了进一步提高合作社的经济指标从而更加显示出集体经济对个体经济的优越性，我们应当特别注意合作社的公有畜牧业的发展，扩大它的建设。
    他强调说，我们的政策是要在城乡建成社会主义制度，建成没有阶级的社会。人民政权将系统地帮助生产合作社和农民的其他集体活动形式。
    报告人指出，国家为帮助生产合作社，将在农业税和义务交售方面给它们优惠。党现在和将来都将同反对生产合作化的修正主义“理论家”作斗争。农业生产合作社的发展是社会主义建设的规律，以及农村经济和文化迅速发展的根本条件。
    接着报告人着重谈到，生产合作社的发展应该按照农民自己的意志来进行，不能破坏自愿的原则。他说，生产合作社是波兰农村的未来。但是不能像教条主义者那样，希望用行政措施来加速这个运动的发展。
    奥哈布接着指出，国家多方面的帮助，应该同发挥农村中的社会—经济主动性互相结合起来。农业小组应该完成这方面的重大任务。
  奥哈布在谈到农村经济问题和加强工农联盟问题时指出，人民国家的政策有助于农业生产的提高和农民生活水平的提高。他说，在人民政权的年代里，波兰农村的阶级关系发生了深刻的变化。他指出，目前农村的主要成分是中农，他们提供大部分商品。当然，这不是说我们就可以不关心贫农的利益了。虽然贫农的人数在日益减少。他说，我们党的政策是支持中小农，并同富农的投机和剥削倾向作斗争。
    奥哈布在谈到农村党组织的任务时说，农民群众越来越把它们看作是自己的朋友、顾问和领导者，农村党组织的威信增长了。
    奥哈布在谈到千百万个体农户自愿转入集体的社会主义农庄、完成七年计划产量指标以及建立合作社和社会主义农村等任务时说，毫无疑问，我们能够完成这些任务。因为我们有着马克思列宁主义学说为指南，因为我们可以利用兄弟共产党的经验，因为我们已经给了修正主义者和教条主义者以坚决的打击。我们已经用正确的政治纲领把我们的队伍团结起来。
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会今天上午会议继续开会，讨论哥穆尔卡和英德里霍夫斯基的报告。在上午会议上发言的共有十一人。
    统一工人党中央政治局委员、国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基首先发言。他主要谈到了党的问题和党在全国阵线中的地位和领导作用问题。他说，党是在团结的气氛中举行代表大会的，党意识到自己的任务和责任，党和广大的城乡劳动人民牢固地团结在一起，并博得了劳动人民的信任。
    在谈到全国阵线的工作时，他说，多年来这个阵线体现着广大劳动群众积极参加国家的社会和政治生活。波兰统一工人党和统一农民党以及其他兄弟党共同实现对这个阵线的思想政治领导。
    萨瓦茨基强调说，列宁的学说是社会主义民主的最重要的内容。列宁说，应当使千百万人，而后逐步使整个社会在党的思想政治领导下参加管理国家，发展自治的社会形式，在这种形式下，群众的主动性、才能、创造力和忘我精神能够得到最有效的发挥。他说，波兰统一工人党八中全会在我国形成发展社会主义民主条件的道路上迈出了一大步。形成这些条件是为了更有效地服务于社会主义的建设事业。
    萨瓦茨基说，人民国家和社会主义民主为基础之一，就是无条件地原则性地遵守法制。他又说，为了杜绝反动派和修正主义对民主团体和机构的影响，有必要对不改正错误的危害分子采取行政措施和进一步提高社会的政治觉悟和社会主义爱国热情。他指出，迫切需要本着党的意识形态来对生活许多领域的思想政治内容进行社会主义的影响。
    萨瓦茨基接着指出，彻底铲除一切不良迹象和曲解党的路线的倾向，以及杜绝复活产生这种曲解的根源的坚决意志，将是实现第三次代表大会决议的保证。
    萨瓦茨基最后谈到用波兰工人革命运动历史和无产阶级国际主义培养干部和加强党的队伍的问题。
    在上午会议上发言的还有科学技术委员会主席马勒茨基、华沙市一个区的代表凯恩奇。
    越南劳动党代表团团长、中央政治局委员武元甲向大会致了贺词并献了一面锦旗，受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    武元甲在贺词中谴责了美帝国主义企图把南越变为军事基地、并唆使南越当局残杀爱国者的罪行。他对波兰在协助实现印度支那停战协定方面所起的巨大作用表示感谢。最后，他祝波兰正在反对修主义和教条主义、巩固社会主义阵营的团结和维护欧洲安全方面取得更大的成就。
    德国共产党代表团团长在致祝词时说，阿登纳对社会主义国家的巨大成就非常仇恨。他拒绝苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议，在国内进行复仇主义宣传。我们德国共产党人将团结整个工人阶级和一切民主力量，为争取缔结对德和约和反对阿登纳政权而斗争。
    采煤动力工业部长瓦尼奥乌卡在会上谈到了波兰将大力增产褐煤、同时也要增产石油和天然瓦斯的问题。
    奥波莱省委员会第一书记沃雅斯在发言中详细谈到这一省十四年来所获得的巨大成就。在谈到农业问题时，他说，农业增产的重要因素是发展农业合作社。现在奥波莱省农业合作社四种谷物每公顷的收获量已达到二十点四公担，这应成为说服农民确信合作社优越的主要论据。
    阿尔及利亚共产党代表团团长致词说，阿尔及利亚政府的成立反映了人民的愿望。我国本想同戴高乐政府进行谈判，停止战争，但戴高乐政府无理加以拒绝了，因此继续战争的责任应由戴高乐政府负责。我们将同阿拉伯各国人民团结起来，共同为争取民族独立而斗争。
    接着，奥地利和芬兰两国共产党代表团团长分别向大会致了祝词。
    所有外国兄弟党代表团团长的致词都受到了热烈的欢迎。
    上午会议至此结束，下午将继续开会。
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会14日下午继续开会。
    会议首先听取了波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员奥哈布关于党的农村政策的报告。
    奥尔兹丁省委员会第一书记托马歇夫斯基在奥哈布报告之后接着发言。他说，奥尔兹丁省的四十个工厂和企业在讨论七年发展指示后，都提高了自己所订的生产指标。
    托马歇夫斯基说，党的政策得到波兰人民的热烈拥护，奥尔兹丁省的企业中有90％的职工参加了代表大会前的生产竞赛，就是很好的证明。在谈到国家的经济建设时，发言人特别强调应该注意西部地区的发展。
    在会议上发言的还有华沙省凡格明的一个农业生产合作社代表科佩茨。在下午会议上，西班牙、巴西和冰岛三个兄弟党代表团团长向大会致了祝词。
    西班牙共产党代表团团长阿尔瓦雷斯说，西班牙各阶层人民对佛朗哥的独裁政权日益不满。如果国内所有民主力量都团结起来，佛朗哥的独裁统治是不会长久的。
    阿尔瓦雷斯要求波兰人民支持西班牙将在今年5月5日开展的民主斗争运动。他最后说，我们党纠正了教条主义和宗派主义的错误，同时也进行了反对修正主义的斗争。
    巴西共产党代表团团长在致词中说，要争取我们的经济独立，必须有和平的外交政策。我们正在为争取巴西同苏联、中国等社会主义国家的联系而斗争。
    冰岛统一社会党代表团团长黑尔加森接着致词。他谴责了英国派军舰公开破坏冰岛宣布捕鱼区为十二海里的合法权利的行动。他还说，我国人民要求美军从我国撤出去，这不仅是为我们自己、也是为国际和平而斗争。
    三个兄弟党代表团团长的讲话受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    14日会议至此结束，15日，大会将休会一天。阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古、朝鲜、越南等八国兄弟党代表团将在这一天到克拉科夫参观访问。
