Xinhua News Agency, 17th. According to TASS reports: Moscow announced today the communique of the Republic of Iraq government delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. The communique announced that after the successful conclusion of the talks between the two government delegations, the Soviet Union and the Republic of Iraq signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation.

In the communique, the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Republic of Iraq stated that they are willing to develop friendly cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs, and expressed their conviction that this cooperation will help strengthen peace and security in the Middle East.

According to the economic and technical cooperation agreement, the Soviet Union will provide technical assistance to the Republic of Iraq to help it build a number of enterprises in heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, food industry, and light industry, etc. Soviet experts will help it expand irrigation systems, conduct geological surveys, and design certain highways. The Soviet Union will help train Iraqi experts.

In order to implement the signed agreement, the Soviet government will provide the Republic of Iraq with a total loan of 550 million rubles, with an annual interest rate of 2.5 percent. The government of the Republic of Iraq will begin repaying the loan in installments annually over twelve years, starting one year after the Soviet Union provides a complete set of equipment.

The Soviet Union will also provide technical assistance to the Iraqi government to help build many other industrial and agricultural projects, and the Soviet side's expenses will be paid according to the provisions of the current Soviet-Iraqi trade agreement.

The Iraqi side stated that it considers the signing of this agreement as a new step in the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries, and believes that this cooperation will help accelerate Iraq's overcoming of the difficulties left over from the colonial era, and help strengthen Iraq's economic independence.

The Soviet side reiterated that this cooperation does not attach any political or other conditions that relate to the sovereignty and national dignity of the Republic of Iraq.

During the negotiations, both parties expressed the hope of developing friendly ties on the basis of expanding trade relations.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. TASS Moscow reported: The Soviet Union and the Republic of Iraq signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries at the Grand Kremlin Palace yesterday. Representing the Soviet side in signing the agreement were Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kuzmin and Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations Arkhipov; representing the Iraqi side were Iraqi Republic Minister of Economy Kuba and Minister of Construction Shebani.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. TASS Moscow reported: "The negotiations we held in Baghdad and Moscow have proven the stable commonality of many basic principles of our two countries' policies, and have proven the consistency of the goals of our two countries' peoples." This is what Dr. Kuba, head of the Iraqi government delegation, said at a reception at the Kremlin on the 16th.

In his speech, Kuba emphasized the irreproachable stance taken by the Soviet Union in maintaining peace and peaceful coexistence.

Kuba said that Iraq, as part of the Arab nation, is firmly following the path of complete solidarity with the liberated Arab countries, and is making every effort to give those Arab peoples who are fighting against imperialism material and spiritual support. When deciding its attitude toward Arab unity, Iraq proceeds from the real-life conditions of the mutually separated Arab countries. The basis for determining this position is to promote the strengthening of Arab peoples' unity in the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries, to provide the greatest freedom and guarantee the greatest progress for the Arabs. Iraq's position on this issue also guarantees a reliable path to seek the most beneficial and solid forms of connection between Arab countries, and these forms should conform to the specific conditions of the Arab countries and the interests of the Arab residents, so as to help the Arab nation achieve their long-cherished goal of national unity through normal democratic channels.

Kuba pointed out that from the very first days of the Iraqi revolution, a new page of friendship was opened in the relations between Iraq and the Soviet Union. Kuba said that there is no doubt that the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful coexistence, its policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, its implementation of equal international cooperation, and its policy of friendship with all countries, especially with Arab countries, have been and are a solid foundation for strengthening and developing friendship and cooperation between Iraq and the Soviet Union.

    伊拉克方面声明，它认为签订这个协定是发展两国之间友好合作的新步骤，并且认为，这种合作将有助于加速伊拉克克服殖民主义时代所遗留下来的困难，有助于加强伊拉克的经济独立。
    苏联方面重申，这种合作不附带任何涉及到伊拉克共和国主权和民族尊严的政治条件以及其他条件。

    库巴在讲话中着重指出了苏联在维护和平与和平共处方面所采取的无可责难的立场。
    库巴说，伊拉克作为阿拉伯民族的一部分，坚定地走着同获得了解放的阿拉伯国家完全团结的道路，并且在尽一切力量给予那些在同帝国主义作斗争的阿拉伯人民物质上和精神上的支持。伊拉克在决定自己对阿拉伯团结的态度时，是从互相分离的阿伯拉国家的现实生活条件出发的，决定这个立场的基础是促进阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义和反动派的斗争中加强团结，提供最大的自由和保证阿拉伯人有最大的进步。伊拉克在这个问题上的立场也保证了谋求阿拉伯国家之间联系的最有益和巩固的形式的可靠道路，这些形式应符合阿拉伯国家的具体条件，和阿拉伯居民群众的利益，以有助于阿拉伯民族通过正常的民主途径达到他们朝夕思念的目标——民族团结。
