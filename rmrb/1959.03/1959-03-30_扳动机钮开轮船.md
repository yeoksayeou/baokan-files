Flipping a Switch to Start a Ship

    The crew of the "Peace No. 45" freighter used a "remote controller" to operate and steer during a recent voyage from Shanghai to Dalian. With it, just one person can easily pilot this 4,000-ton ship.
    Speaking of steering a ship, it's quite complex. For example, in the past, when the captain issued a sailing order in the bridge, the watch officer would have to ring the engine room telegraph to notify the engine room crew, who would then operate the machinery according to the telegraph signals. This required the operation of four people, which was not only slow but also prone to errors. Now, the "Peace No. 45" is not like that. The helmsman stands in front of a "remote controller" that looks like a radio, flipping various switches, and the ship can start, stop, speed up, slow down, move forward, backward, and turn. All the manual operations of the past have been replaced by electricity. This controller can also be moved at will. For example, in foggy weather, the controller can be moved to the bow deck for steering.

    扳动机钮开轮船
    “和平四十五号”货轮的船员，在最近从上海到大连的一次航程中，使用了一种“遥远操纵器”来操纵驾驶。有了它，只要一个人便能轻松地驾驶这艘四千多吨的大轮船。
    说起驾驶轮船，也真够复杂。譬如开船，过去船长在驾驶室发出航令，要由值班驾驶员打车钟通知机舱轮机员，再由轮机员按照车钟信号操纵机器，中间要经过四个人操作，不但速度慢，而且容易出差错。现在
  “和平四十五号”可不是这样。驾驶员站在一架像收音机似的“遥远操纵器”前面，扳动着各种电钮，轮船就可以开、停、快、慢、前进、倒退和转弯，所有过去的人力操作，都被电力代替。这种操纵器还可随意搬动。比如下雾天气，就可以把操纵器搬到船头甲板上去驾驶。
