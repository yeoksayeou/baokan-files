Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: China's first large-scale thin plate rolling mill has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. After inspection, its quality meets national requirements and standards.

The roll diameter of this thin plate rolling mill is 760 millimeters, and it can roll 30,000 to 50,000 tons of thin steel plates with a width of 1.2 meters annually. It is one of the key products of China's machinery manufacturing industry this year. Its structure is complex, and the technical requirements are very strict. The total weight of the entire rolling mill set is 380 tons, of which the main reducer alone weighs 92 tons. After accepting this task, the Heavy Machinery Plant immediately made specific arrangements to ensure the timely completion of key products. (Attached picture)

    太原制成大型薄板轧钢机
    据新华社太原19日电  我国第一台大型薄板轧机最近在太原重型机器厂试制成功。经过检验，它的质量合乎国家要求标准。
    这台薄板轧机的轧辊直径为七百六十公厘，每年能轧制一点二公尺宽的薄钢板三万到五万吨，是今年我国机器制造工业的重点产品之一。它的结构复杂，技术要求很严格；轧机全套的总重量为三百八十吨，其中仅主减速机就有九十二吨重。重型机器厂接受这一任务后，立即作了具体的安排，以保证重点产品按时完成。（附图片）
