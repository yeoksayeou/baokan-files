    Women, Summon Sky-High Drive and Make Greater Contributions!
    It is of great significance to commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th at a time when the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward of 1959 is beginning to reach its climax.
    In the short year from last year's "March 8th" to this year's "March 8th," along with China's unprecedented Great Leap Forward, China's women's movement has also leaped to a new historical stage. Due to the rapid development of various production and construction undertakings, the great victory of the rural people's communization throughout the country, and the establishment of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, the vast female labor force has been further liberated. The number of women participating in labor production has increased unprecedentedly. Almost 100% of women with labor power in rural areas have participated in various production labors of the people's communes. In some places, women have become the main force in field farming. On the industrial production front, women have not only participated in textile industry, food industry and other light industrial production, but also in heavy industrial production. In the mass movement of the whole people making steel, the broad masses of women bravely threw themselves into the battle like men, and played a certain role in completing the task of doubling steel production in 1958. Women's contributions are particularly outstanding in commerce, culture, education, health and other service industries. At present, there are 4.98 million nurseries and kindergartens and more than 3.6 million public canteens in rural areas across the country. Women are a strong main force in the noble position of this emerging service industry. Women are more respected and cared for both in society and in the family, family life is more harmonious and united, and women are more comfortable.
    The tremendous achievements and changes made by women in 1958 have made the broad masses of women more deeply realize that only on the basis of production development, and only when women's contributions to socialist construction are increasing day by day, can the material, cultural life and political and economic status of women be further improved. Women across the country realize that the interests of women are consistent with the interests of the collective and the interests of the country. Only by actively participating in labor can we make the most concrete and practical contribution to socialist construction, and it is also a practical way to further improve our economic status and social status. At the same time, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 also fully demonstrated that in order to rapidly develop industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses of women and make them a vital force in socialist construction.
    In order to make 1959 a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, women across the country must continue to exert their efforts and make greater contributions in this greater leap forward. At present, the vast majority of women have participated in social labor production. In order to further give play to their role, the central issue is how to continue to break down superstitions, emancipate the mind, and carry out mass technical revolution movements in order to further improve women's labor productivity. Carrying out the technical revolution movement is the central task of the entire party and the entire people at present, and it is also an urgent requirement of women due to the limitations of women's physical strength and physiological characteristics. Only by carrying out the technical revolution movement can we improve labor efficiency, ensure the completion of this year's leap forward plan, and also reduce labor intensity and fundamentally solve the problem of women's labor protection. Women across the country must actively participate in this movement, continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, overcome inferiority complexes, strive to learn and promote new technologies and new tools, and boldly create inventions to give play to women's intelligence and wisdom in order to further improve labor efficiency.
    In order to ensure that women can better participate in labor production, it is also necessary to further consolidate and improve existing collective living welfare organizations. Facts have proved that the large-scale establishment of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens has fundamentally solved the contradiction between women's participation in social production and managing housework, thereby further liberating female labor. According to statistics from the labor department, the total number of female labor force liberated in rural areas across the country last year due to the establishment of public canteens and nurseries and other collective welfare undertakings reached more than 50 million; many women in the past did not attend meetings, did not work, and did not participate in social activities because they were burdened by children, and were called "three nos" members by others. After the establishment of the people's commune, the nurseries were set up, and they got rid of the worries of children and actively participated in production labor, and changed from "three nos" members to "three active" members, actively working, actively participating in meetings, and actively participating in social activities. What a huge change this is! Female members of the Wufeng People's Commune in Wan'an County, Jiangxi Province, increased their work points in 1958 by one-third to one-half compared with 1957 because their children were enrolled in nurseries, and some increased by two-thirds. This shows how important the promotion of collective welfare undertakings is for liberating female labor and for developing production? At present, consolidating and improving these collective living welfare undertakings is also a very important task in the work of rectifying the commune. Various places are now taking various measures to train childcare workers and canteen cooks in rotation. And the vast majority of those who work in these collective welfare undertakings are women. Therefore, women should actively participate in training, improve their political and professional level, and run collective living welfare undertakings, especially childcare undertakings, better.
    If women want to do a good job in all fronts, they must strengthen political and theoretical study and improve their ideological awareness. Having only technology without politics will lose the commander and lose the direction of progress, and technology will not be learned well. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve socialist and communist consciousness, strengthen collectivist viewpoints in collective production and collective life, and in the work of rectifying the commune, and correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and collective interests, and between collective interests and national interests.
    To do the above work well, we must rely on the efforts of women themselves, and also rely on party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over women's work. At present, while boldly mobilizing women, party committees at all levels should pay attention to training female cadres and activists. In the past, all localities have trained a large number of female cadres and activists, but because the scale of production is becoming wider and wider, the content of production is becoming more and more complex, and the number of women participating in production is increasing more and more, the original female cadres and activists have appeared to be very insufficient. This requires efforts to achieve "every commune has a female president, and every team has a female captain," and to strengthen the training of female cadres and activists in a planned way to adapt to the needs of the development of the situation.
    Women in New China are a huge force. Under the leadership of party organizations at all levels and with the care and support of relevant departments at all levels, women's creativity and enthusiasm will surely be further brought into play, and they will surely make greater contributions to this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

### 妇女们，鼓足冲天干劲  作出更大贡献！

    妇女们，鼓足冲天干劲
    作出更大贡献！
    当1959年更大更好更全面地跃进开始进入高潮的时候，来纪念“三八”国际妇女节是具有重大意义的。
    从去年“三八”到今年“三八”的短短一年中，随着我国空前的大跃进，我国的妇女运动也跃进到一个新的历史阶段。由于各项生产建设事业的飞跃发展，由于全国农村人民公社化的巨大胜利，由于公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等等集体福利事业的创办，广大妇女劳动力获得了进一步解放。妇女参加劳动生产的人数空前增加，农村有劳动力的妇女，几乎百分之百地参加了人民公社的各项生产劳动，有些地方妇女已成为田间耕作的主力。在工业生产战线上，妇女不仅参加了纺织工业、食品工业及其他轻工业生产，也参加了重工业生产；在全民大炼钢铁的群众运动中，广大妇女同男子一样英勇地投入了战斗，对于完成1958年钢产翻一番的任务起了一定的作用。在商业、文化、教育、卫生和其他服务性行业方面，妇女的贡献尤为出色。目前，全国农村有四百九十八万所托儿所、幼儿园，三百六十多万处公共食堂。在这个新兴的服务行业的崇高岗位上，妇女是强大的主力军。妇女无论在社会上或者家庭中，都更加受到尊敬和爱护，家庭生活也更加和睦团结，妇女的心情也更加舒畅了。
    1958年妇女所获得的巨大成就与变化，使广大妇女群众更深刻地体会到，只有在生产发展的基础上，只有妇女对社会主义建设的贡献日益增进的时候，才能进一步提高妇女的物质、文化生活和政治、经济地位。全国妇女认识到：妇女的利益与集体的利益、国家的利益是一致的。只有积极参加劳动，才是对社会主义建设的最具体最实际的贡献，也是进一步提高自己经济地位、社会地位的实际途径。同时，1958年的大跃进也充分说明，为了迅速发展工农业生产，必须把妇女群众充分发动起来，使她们成为社会主义建设的生力军。
    为了使1959年成为更大更好更全面跃进的一年，全国妇女必须继续鼓足干劲，在这个更大跃进的行列中作出更巨大的贡献。目前，绝大部分妇女都参加了社会劳动生产。为了进一步发挥她们的作用，中心问题就是如何继续破除迷信，解放思想，开展群众性的技术革命运动，以便进一步提高妇女的劳动生产率。开展技术革命运动是当前全党全民的中心任务，由于妇女体力的限制及生理上的特点，也是妇女的迫切要求。只有开展技术革命运动，才能提高劳动效率，保证完成今年跃进计划，也才能减轻劳动强度，从根本上解决妇女劳动保护问题。全国妇女要积极投入这个运动，继续发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，克服自卑观念，努力学习和推广新技术、新工具，并大胆创造发明，为进一步提高劳动效率而发挥妇女的聪明才智。
    为了保证妇女更好地参加劳动生产，还需要进一步巩固和提高现有集体生活福利组织。事实证明：公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业的大量举办，从根本上解决了妇女参加社会生产和料理家务的矛盾，从而进一步解放了妇女劳动力。据劳动部门统计：去年全国农村由于举办了公共食堂和托儿所等等集体福利事业，解放出来的妇女劳动力总数达到五千万人以上；许多妇女过去由于孩子牵累，不参加开会，不出工，不参加社会活动，被别人叫作“三不”社员，在人民公社建立后，托儿所办起来了，她们摆脱了孩子的牵挂，积极参加生产劳动，由“三不”社员变成了“三积极”社员，积极出工，积极参加会议，积极参加社会活动。这是多么巨大的变化啊！江西省万安县五丰人民公社女社员由于孩子入了托儿所，1958年的工分比1957年增加三分之一到二分之一，有的增加到三分之二。由此可见，集体福利事业的举办，对于解放妇女劳动力、对于发展生产，有着何等重大的促进作用？目前，在整社工作中，巩固和提高这些集体生活福利事业也是一项十分重要的任务。现在各地正采取各种办法，轮训保教工作人员和食堂炊事员。而在这些集体福利事业里工作的，绝大多数是妇女。因此，妇女们要积极参加训练，提高自己的政治和业务水平，把集体生活福利事业，特别是托儿事业办得更好。
    妇女要做好各条战线上的工作，就要加强政治理论学习，提高思想觉悟，光有技术，没有政治，就失去了统帅，失去了前进的方向，而且，技术也学不好。因此，必须不断提高社会主义和共产主义的觉悟，在集体生产和集体生活中，在整社工作中，加强集体主义观点，正确处理个人利益与集体利益、集体利益和国家利益的关系。
    要做好以上工作，要靠妇女自己的努力，也要靠各级党组织加强对妇女工作的领导。目前，在放手发动妇女的同时，各级党组织要注意培养妇女干部和积极分子。过去各地已经培养了大批妇女干部和积极分子，但由于生产规模越来越广，生产内容越来越复杂，而妇女参加生产的人数又是越来越多，原有的妇女干部和积极分子已显得非常不够，这就需要努力作到“社社有女社长，队队有女队长”，有计划地加强妇女干部和积极分子的培养，以适应形势发展的需要。
    新中国的妇女是一支巨大的力量，在各级党组织的领导下，在各级有关部门的关怀和支持下，妇女的创造性、积极性一定能得到进一步的发挥，一定能在今年更大更好更全面的跃进中，作出更大的贡献。
