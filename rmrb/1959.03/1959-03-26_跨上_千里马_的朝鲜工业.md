    Korean Industry Riding the "Chollima"
    Huang Daoyuan, Director of the Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    The Korean industry, riding the "Chollima" (Thousand-li Horse), is developing at a leaping speed. At present, the total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries in Korea is equal to four times that of the pre-war 1949 level. From 1954 to 1958 after the war, the Korean industry grew at an average annual rate of 42.3%; from 1953 to 1958, the production of means of production in Korean industry grew at an average annual rate of 52%, and the production of consumer goods grew at an average annual rate of 34%. The development of Korean industry is not only high-speed, but also balanced. It is firmly established on the economic principles of socialist expanded reproduction of Marxism-Leninism. Today, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has established its own strong heavy and light industry base, which can rapidly accelerate the speed of socialist industrial expanded reproduction and support the rural areas in water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification. This means that it has built its own completely independent industry. Now, the Korean working class is confidently implementing the 1959 industrial development plan, preparing to complete the first five-year plan two years ahead of schedule by the end of this year.
    In 1958, the leap-forward development of Korean industry was of decisive significance for completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.
    In 1958, the total state investment in capital construction was 34.1 billion won (26% more than in 1957), of which 55% was allocated to industrial construction. In this year, state-owned enterprises and cooperatives completed 117% of the basic plan for total industrial output value, producing industrial products worth 21.7 billion won (Korean currency) more than the state basic plan. The total industrial output value completed by state-owned enterprises and cooperatives was equal to 140% of that in 1957, and twice that of 1956, the last year of the Three-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the national economy after the war. In terms of labor productivity, the plan was overfulfilled by 6%. The cost of industrial products was reduced by 2.3% compared with the planned cost, and by an average of 8.6% compared with 1957. The actual wages of workers and staff increased by 13% compared with the previous year.
    Several things are worth noting in the industrial construction work of Korea in 1958:
    First, since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party in June 1958, many small-scale local factories and enterprises have been built all over the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. From September to the end of the year, more than 1,060 enterprises managed by cities and counties were built. These enterprises used local raw materials to produce a large number of food, daily necessities, construction materials, and agricultural tools. Second, the labor force in Korea has grown tremendously, especially with the large-scale participation of women in production. In 1958, democratic Korea not only had no unemployed, but also had insufficient labor. Therefore, a widespread movement was launched throughout the country to mobilize women to participate in labor. In this year, the number of female workers in the industrial sector increased by 1.4 times compared with the previous year, and the proportion of female workers in the total number of employees increased from 22% in 1957 to 34%. Third, a historically significant technical innovation movement was launched on the industrial front. The working masses broke the mystery of technology, gave full play to their high creativity, and created amazing miracles. They put forward more than 37,000 inventions and rationalization proposals, and more than 4,900 were adopted in production. The adoption of the method of iron smelting with iron coke significantly reduced the consumption of coking coal and reduced the utilization coefficient of the internal volume of the blast furnace. The use of hydraulic mining and continuous drilling in mines and coal mines greatly improved labor productivity. In the production of plate glass, the method of burning gas with domestic anthracite was created, and in the textile industry, the method of using reed and corn stalks to produce artificial pulp for weaving cloth was created.
    In 1958, Korea produced many new products for the first time, such as tractors, excavators, trucks, bulldozers, electric locomotives for mines, 50-ton refrigerated ships, 4,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators, universal milling machines, drilling machines, automatic looms, automatic threshers, Korean typewriters, and electric washing machines. These new products will be produced in large quantities this year.
    The production volume of important products in 1958 and its growth are as follows:

    Due to the achievements of Korean industrial construction after liberation, especially the leap-forward development in 1958, the current production level of major products in Korea, compared with 1944 during the Japanese rule, increased coal to 120%, steel to 2.5 times, steel products to 2.4 times, cement to 139%, logs to 143%, and textiles to 80 times, thus completely eliminating the backward colonial deformity of Korean industry during the Japanese rule. The following statistics illustrate the situation of Korean industry overcoming colonial deformity:

    From the above table, it can be seen that the Japanese imperialists wantonly exploited Korea's rich underground resources, wantonly felled forest resources, roughly processed them and transported them to their own country, and focused on the production of military supplies aimed at invading the Asian continent - chemical industry products. During the Japanese rule, fuel, ore mining, metallurgy, chemical industry, forest products and wood processing industries accounted for 63% of the total industrial output value. At that time, Korea's machinery and metal processing industries were only small-scale repair shops; textile industry, stationery and groceries production were also just small-scale handicraft-style weaving factories, knitting factories and daily necessities factories. Thus, during the Japanese rule, Korea was a place where imperialist robbers plundered raw materials, a market for them to sell goods, and a most typical colonial appendage.
    Today, the situation in Korea has fundamentally changed. The Korean industry has further strengthened the fuel and power base, and produces a large number of various heavy machinery and equipment, various steel products, non-ferrous metal products, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, medicines, cement, prefabricated components, various cotton textiles, silk fabrics, glass, ceramic utensils, various daily necessities, meat, fish, fruits, vegetables and canned food, etc.
    On the basis of the leap-forward development of industry in 1958, in 1959, the Korean industry will develop even further. The Korean workers unanimously support the letter from the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea to all party members. They are determined not to increase production by a few percent, but by several times. They are giving full play to their unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm to realize their determination.
    Encouraged by the correct economic policies and wise leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Republic headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean workers will undoubtedly overfulfill the first five-year plan two years ahead of schedule this year. Li Jong-ok, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of Korea, announced at the Fifth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea in February this year that the Korean People's Economic Plan for 1959 stipulates that 9.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 10.86 million tons of coal, 1.124 million tons of pig iron and granular iron, 884,000 tons of steel, 706,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 3.185 million tons of cement, 855,000 tons of fish, and 200 million meters of cloth will be produced this year. By the end of this year, Korea will far exceed Japan in terms of per capita important industrial products such as electricity, coal, pig iron, cement, chemical fertilizers, as well as fish catch and grain output. At that time, the industrial output value of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will account for more than 70% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.
    In September last year, Premier Kim Il-sung put forward a grand goal of advancement to the Korean people: "In the next six or seven years, the annual output of important industrial products in Korea should reach the following levels: 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 million tons of coal, 4 million tons of pig iron and granular iron, 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, 1.5 million to 2 million tons of chemical fertilizers, 5 million tons of cement, 500 million meters of cloth, 100,000 tons of sugar, and 1 million tons of fish." Premier Kim Il-sung said: "Achieving these targets will turn our past backward country into a developed socialist industrial country and will fundamentally improve the material and cultural life of the people." When this call was submitted to the Korean working people for discussion, they resolved to achieve this grand goal in four or five years.
    Looking forward to a bright future, the Korean people are responding to the call of the Workers' Party of Korea with full confidence, realizing production targets by day and by month, striving to improve product quality, and completing production plans in a balanced manner. (Picture attached)

    跨上“千里马”的朝鲜工业
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局局长  黄道渊
    跨上“千里马”的朝鲜工业，正以飞跃的速度向前发展。目前，朝鲜国营和合作社工业总产值已等于战前1949年的四倍。从战后1954年到1958年，朝鲜工业每年平均增长42.3％；从1953年到1958年，朝鲜工业中生产资料的生产平均每年增长52％，消费资料的生产平均每年增长34％。朝鲜工业的发展，不仅是高速度的，而且是均衡的。它牢固地建立在马克思列宁主义的社会主义扩大再生产的经济原则上。今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经建立起自己的强有力的重工业和轻工业基地，它能够迅速地加快社会主义工业扩大再生产的速度，能够支援农村进行水利化、机械化、电气化。这就是说，它已经建设起本国的完全自主的工业了，现在，朝鲜工人阶级正在满怀信心地执行1959年的工业发展计划，准备在今年年底提前两年完成战后第一个五年计划。
    1958年，朝鲜工业飞跃发展，对提前完成第一个五年计划具有决定性意义。
    1958年，国家对基本建设的投资总额是三百四十一亿元（比1957年增加了26％），其中55％是拨给工业建设的。这一年，国营企业和合作社完成了工业总产值基本计划的117％，比国家基本计划增产了价值二百一十七亿元（朝币）的工业产品。国营企业和合作社所完成的工业总产值，等于1957年的140％，等于战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划最后一年——1956年的二倍。在劳动生产率方面，超额6％完成了计划。工业产品的成本比计划成本降低2.3％，比1957年平均降低8.6％。工人和职员的实际工资比前一年增加13％。
    1958年，朝鲜工业建设工作中有几件事值得注意：
    第一，自从党中央委员会1958年6月全会以来，全国各地都像雨后春笋一样兴建起许多小规模的地方工厂企业。从9月到年底，就建成了市、郡经营的一千零六十多个企业。这些企业利用地方原料，生产了大量的食品、日用品、建设器材和农具等。第二，朝鲜的劳动队伍有了巨大的发展，尤其是妇女大量参加生产。在1958年，民主朝鲜不仅没有一个失业者，而且劳动力还不足。因此，各地广泛地展开了动员妇女参加劳动的运动。这一年，工业部门的妇女劳动力比上年增加了一点四倍，妇女劳动力在全体职工中所占的比重从1957年的22％增长到34％。第三，工业战线上展开了一个具有历史意义的技术革新运动。工人群众打破技术的神秘性，发挥高度的创造性，创造了惊人的奇迹，他们提出了三万七千多件创造发明和合理化建议，被采用到生产上的有四千九百多件。由于采用了以铁焦炼铁的方法，显著地减少了焦煤消费量，降低了高炉的内部容积的利用系数。在矿山和煤矿采用水力采矿法和连续钻孔法，大大提高了劳动生产率。在板玻璃生产上，创造了用国产无烟煤烧出煤气的方法，在纺织工业上，创造了用芦苇和玉米秆生产人造浆来织布的方法。
    1958年，朝鲜首次生产了拖拉机、挖土机、卡车、推土机、矿山用的电气机车、五十吨级冷冻船、四千瓩水力发电机、万能铣床、钻床、自动织机、自动打谷机、朝文打字机和电力洗衣机等许多新产品，这些新产品今年将大量生产。
    1958年重要产品的生产量及其增长情况如下：
    由于解放后朝鲜工业建设的成就，特别是1958年的飞跃发展，目前朝鲜主要产品的生产水平，同日本统治时期1944年相比，煤增至120％，钢增至二点五倍，钢材增至二点四倍，水泥增至139％，原木增至143％，纺织品增至八十倍，因而彻底消灭了日本统治时期朝鲜工业的落后的殖民地畸形性。下列统计数字说明朝鲜工业克服殖民地畸形性的情况：
    从上表可以看出，日本帝国主义者滥行采掘朝鲜丰富的地下资源，滥伐森林资源，粗略加工之后就运往本国，并且着重生产旨在侵略亚洲大陆的军需品——化学工业产品。日本统治时期，在工业总产值中，燃料、矿石采掘、冶金、化学、林产和木材加工等工业占63％。那时，朝鲜的机械和金属加工工业只不过是一些规模小得可怜的修理厂；纺织工业、文具和杂货生产也不过是小规模的手工业式的织布厂、针织厂和日用品工厂。这样，日本统治时期，朝鲜是一个帝国主义强盗掠取原料的地方，是他们销售商品的市场，是一个最典型的殖民地附属国。
    今天朝鲜的情况有了根本改变。朝鲜工业进一步加强了燃料动力基地，并且大量地生产各种重型机械和设备，各种钢材、有色金属制品、化学肥料、农药、医药品、水泥、预制构件、各种棉纺织品、绸缎、玻璃、陶瓷器皿、各种日用品、肉类、鱼类、水果、蔬菜和罐头等。
    在1958年工业飞跃发展的基础上，1959年，朝鲜工业将要更进一步飞跃发展。朝鲜工人们一致拥护朝鲜劳动党中央委员会给全体党员的信，他们下定决心：不是把生产提高百分之几，而是提高几倍。他们为实现自己的决心而发挥无比的爱国热情。
    朝鲜工人为以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确的经济政策和英明领导所鼓舞，毫无疑问，他们将提前两年在今年内超额完成第一个五年计划。朝鲜国家计划委员会委员长李钟玉今年2月间在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第五次会议上宣布，朝鲜1959年人民经济计划规定，今年要生产电力九十七亿度、煤炭一千零八十六万吨、生铁和粒铁一百十二万四千吨、钢八十八万四千吨、化学肥料七十万六千吨、水泥三百十八万五千吨、鱼类八十五万五千吨、布匹二亿公尺。到今年年底，朝鲜将在电力、煤炭、生铁、水泥、化学肥料等重要工业产品以及捕鱼量和谷物产量方面按人口平均计算远远超过日本。那时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业产值，将占工农业总产值的70％以上。
    去年9月间，金日成首相向朝鲜人民提出一个宏伟的前进目标：“在今后六、七年内，要使朝鲜的重要工业产品的年产量达到下面的水平：电力二百亿度、煤炭二千五百万吨、生铁和粒铁四百万吨、钢三百到三百五十万吨、化学肥料一百五十到二百万吨、水泥五百万吨、布匹五亿公尺、糖十万吨、鱼类一百万吨。”金日成首相说：“达到这些指标，就会使我们这个过去落后的国家变成发达的社会主义工业国，并且将从根本上改善人民的物质和文化生活。”当这一号召提交朝鲜劳动人民讨论的时候，他们决心要在四年或五年内实现这个宏伟的目标。
    朝鲜人民眺望着光辉灿烂的未来，信心百倍地响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，正在按天按月实现生产指标，努力提高产品质量，均衡地完成生产计划。（附图片）
