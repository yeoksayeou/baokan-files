Commenting on Japan's New Fiscal Year Budget
　　Wan Feng
    On March 3rd, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, relying on its majority of seats, passed the Kishida Nobusuke government's 1959 fiscal year national budget unchanged in the House of Representatives of the Diet.
    Japan's 1959 fiscal year national budget is the largest national budget in post-war Japan. The total revenue and expenditure of this budget are 1,419.2 billion yen (nearly 4 billion US dollars), an increase of 107.1 billion yen compared to the 1958 fiscal year. The size of this budget is eleven times larger than the first normal budget in post-war Japan in 1947.
    Judging from the content of the budget expenditure, this is a budget in which the Kishida Nobusuke government is doing its utmost to use state funds to help Japanese monopoly capital tide over the difficult period of the economic crisis, intensify the revival of militarism, and implement economic expansion overseas. It is also a budget that attacks the lives of the Japanese working people.
    Paying Tribute to Monopoly Capital and Stifling Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
    When Kishida Nobusuke delivered a policy speech in the Diet on January 27th this year, he emphasized that the government "intends to make greater efforts to ensure the stable development of our country's economy, which is said to have shallow roots, and to improve the constitution of our economy." Shizaka Taizo, chairman of the headquarters of Japanese monopoly capital, "Japan Federation of Economic Organizations," also said with regard to the compilation of the budget that the Japanese government should only adopt two policies at present: one is to promote exports, and the other is to improve the economic constitution. The so-called "stable development of the economy" means consolidating the foundation of Japanese monopoly capital, enabling it to get rid of the heavy blow of the economic crisis, and strengthening its rule over the Japanese people. The specific contents of "improving the economic constitution" are: (1) Intensify the plunder of the working class, reduce production costs, promote capital concentration, and squeeze out and crack down on small and medium-sized enterprises through corporate reorganization and industrial "rationalization" measures; (2) Concentrate financial funds on large monopoly capital to enhance its strength and maintain monopoly prices and monopoly profits; (3) Reorganize and expand the roads, ports, railways and other transportation facilities that are the "common wealth" of monopoly capital. The Japanese monopoly capital group attempts to stimulate the domestic economy and increase its competitiveness in the international market through such "economic constitution improvement". The so-called "promoting exports" is actually actively carrying out economic expansion abroad. Judging from the unprecedented expansion of fiscal investment and loans and the increase in appropriations to the Export-Import Bank of Japan in the 1959 budget, the Kishida Nobusuke government's new fiscal year budget is making its best efforts to meet the requirements of the Japanese monopoly capital group.
    In the 1959 budget, the Kishida Nobusuke government planned to invest and loan 519.8 billion yen in the fiscal investment and loan to the large enterprise sector, of which the expenditure used to expand the equipment of large enterprises such as steel, electric power, shipping, and coal mines and to build transportation equipment such as ports, highways, and railways in the name of "public works expenses" amounted to 232 billion yen, an increase of 47.5 billion yen compared to the 1958 fiscal year. The cost of building roads and ports alone increased by 36.7 billion yen, exceeding the increase in social security expenses or cultural and educational and scientific promotion expenses.
    The Kishida Nobusuke government's appropriation to the Export-Import Bank of Japan in the 1959 budget jumped to 36 billion yen, equivalent to four times that of the 1958 fiscal year. If the original funds are added, the funds that the Export-Import Bank of Japan, which is specifically responsible for developing overseas markets, can use in the 1959 fiscal year will reach 80 billion yen. This fund is mainly used to provide yen loans to Southeast Asian countries, implement deferred payment exports, and export complete sets of equipment. In addition, the total amount of expenses related to war reparations in the "Defense Agency" budget was determined to be 32.3 billion yen, an increase of 6.1 billion yen compared to the 1958 fiscal year. Because compensation is in the form of physical objects (mainly production equipment) and "technical assistance," the money allocated by the Kishida Nobusuke government helps Japanese monopoly capital expand commodity exports and capital exports to the Southeast Asian region.
    Because the Kishida Nobusuke government is opening its "pocketbook" so greatly, large monopoly capital can have more ample funds for so-called "industrial rationalization" investment. In this way, the general industrial investment reduction caused by the deepening of the overproduction crisis will be alleviated. Judging from this year's equipment investment plan, many important industrial sectors are roughly the same as last year or even slightly higher. Moreover, due to large-scale construction projects such as road and port repairs, industrial sectors such as steel, machinery manufacturing, and cement will open up sales channels for their products, which will stimulate domestic demand. As for increasing appropriations to the Export-Import Bank of Japan, it shows that Japanese monopoly capital is trying to use domestic financial capital to increase its economic expansion strength, given that the hope of relying on foreign capital is unlikely to be realized. In short, this budget prominently reflects the attempt of the Japanese monopoly group to strengthen state monopoly capitalism and rely on state financial assistance to find a way out of the economic crisis.
    In contrast, although Kishida Nobusuke hypocritically said that "measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises from the aspects of the tax system and finance will be further strengthened," in fact, the "small and medium-sized enterprise countermeasure fee" in the entire budget is only 2.2 billion yen, accounting for 1.6 per thousand of the entire budget. This is as little as a sparrow's tears, as the Japanese idiom says. As for fiscal investment and loans, financial institutions such as the Japan Development Bank, the Japan Export-Import Bank, and the Electric Power Development Corporation, which are related to large enterprises, have significantly increased their investment and loans. However, the Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Corporation and other institutions related to small and medium-sized enterprises have hardly increased their investment and loans.
    Since the outbreak of the overproduction crisis in Japan in the spring of 1957, small and medium-sized enterprises have been increasingly closing down due to the lack of funds and sales difficulties as large monopoly capital has transferred the consequences of the crisis to them in every possible way. According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," more than 2,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the textile industry went bankrupt in 1958 alone. This year, as the Kishida Nobusuke government continues to implement policies that stifle small and medium-sized enterprises, their situation will become even more difficult.
    A Budget for the Revival of Militarism
    In order to intensify the revival of militarism and reorganize armaments centering on nuclear weapons, Kishida Nobusuke determined a huge 1959 military budget while negotiating with the United States to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The total amount of the "Defense Agency" budget for the 1959 fiscal year reached 136.04 billion yen, an increase of 15.98 billion yen compared to the 1958 fiscal year. This expenditure, plus the US military advisor fees stationed in Japan and the "defense burden sharing fee," totaled 153.665 billion yen. With the increase in military spending, the three services of the Japanese army, navy and air force have all made plans to increase their troops and equipment.
    This plan to strengthen the equipment of the three services provides a considerable market for Japan's arms industry. The "Industrial Economic News" of Japan recently reported that 1959 is a turning point for the Japanese arms industry. In this year, Japan will vigorously manufacture warships, jet fighters, and trial-produce missiles. Producing missiles is one of the important goals of the Japanese arms industry this year. The "Defense Agency" has established a "Missile Headquarters" and plans to build a "Missile Test Force." After purchasing the Swiss "Oerlikon" missile, Japan also plans to continue to purchase the American "Sidewinder" and "Nike" missiles for research and test launch.
    Arms production is an important source for Japan to maintain the expansion of monopoly capital, and it is also the main pillar for the revival of imperialism. Moreover, since the arms buyer is the Japanese government, this market is quite stable. The Kishida Nobusuke government determined such a huge military budget in the 1959 fiscal year, also in order to promote economic militarization, to develop the arms industry to stimulate the entire economy, and to seek a way out of the crisis.
    In addition to huge military expenditures, the Kishida Nobusuke government also allocated large sums of money to provide financial resources for the revival of militarist activities. The old soldiers' pensions, which accounted for 6.8% of the entire budget, amounting to 96.75 billion yen, were the expenses for supporting Japanese militarist elements. This expenditure increased by 11.37 billion yen compared to the 1958 fiscal year. The "Moral Education Lecture Meeting Expenses" of as much as 32 million yen in education funds were also used to restore militarist education. This expenditure increased sevenfold compared to the 1958 fiscal year. In addition, in 1959, a "subsidy" totaling 38 million yen was newly established to be issued to the chairmen of the local education committees that directly implemented the "performance evaluation" system.
    Further Tightening the People's Belts
    Ninety percent of the Kishida Nobusuke government's 1959 budget revenue mainly comes from the blood and sweat taxes it squeezes from the Japanese people. As for the more than 500 billion yen that it concentrates on large monopoly capital in the form of fiscal investment and loans, in addition to the state financial funds composed of people's taxes, it also uses people's savings and public bonds to pay tribute to monopoly capital. However, in the budget expenditure, the Kishida Nobusuke government has tried every possible way to deduct expenditures related to people's lives and welfare.
    Under the impact of the economic crisis, the number of unemployed people in Japan has been increasing due to the large-scale reduction of workers by capitalists for many years. The total number of registered and unregistered unemployed people has reached 10 million. However, the unemployment relief fund in the 1959 budget was reduced instead. The budget also reduced the "living protection fee" for poor people and the welfare loan amount for "mother and child families" (families without fathers).
    In order to win votes, the Kishida Nobusuke group has been vigorously publicizing that it has realized the promise of "tax reduction" made in the last general election in this budget. Yes, it announced that it would reduce direct taxes by 52.5 billion yen in the new fiscal year. However, on the other hand, in terms of indirect taxes, it will extract another 95.3 billion yen from the hard-pressed Japanese people in the name of "natural increase." Even in terms of tax reduction, according to the Kishida Nobusuke government's approach, families with low wages will not only not benefit, but will also increase their economic burden due to the Kishida Nobusuke government's increase in bus fares, railway fares, and electricity bills.
    Another "good thing" that the Kishida Nobusuke group is touting is that a "national pension" totaling 11 billion yen has been newly established in this budget, saying that it is used to help the helpless old, young, disabled, and orphans and widows. In fact, this amount of money is completely useless for nearly four million people in need of relief, with an average of only more than 2,500 yen per person per year (equivalent to less than 17 yuan in our RMB). Furthermore, the "national pension" is included in the social security expenses. Due to the establishment of the new "national pension," other social security expenses have been greatly reduced, and as a result, the number of people receiving living relief has decreased by 23,000 compared to the previous year, which has made the unemployment problem even more serious.
    After the Kishida Nobusuke government's budget is passed, the new fiscal year will begin. However, the prospects are not so bright for the Kishida Nobusuke group to intensify the revival of militarism and implement economic expansion through such a huge budget. In Japan, the already very serious overcapacity will become more acute due to the newly added equipment, and the "economic overheating" has the risk of leading to inflation. Abroad, the people of Southeast Asia are deeply wary of Japan's potential imperialism. At the same time, after the implementation of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries and the implementation of free exchange of foreign exchange, the "international commercial war" will intensify, and Japan's economic expansion will encounter stronger competitors. Finally, and most importantly, the increasingly powerful struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people to strive for a path of peace and neutrality and develop a peaceful economy will give the ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capital group a doubled blow.

    评日本新年度国家预算
    万峰
    本月3日，日本执政的自由民主党依仗它的多数议席，使国会众议院原封不动地通过了岸信介政府的1959年度国家预算。
    1959年度的日本国家预算，是战后日本规模最庞大的一次国家预算。这次预算的收支总额各为一万四千一百九十二亿日元（将近四十亿美元），比1958年度增加了一千零七十一亿日元。这次预算的规模要比战后日本第一次有正常预算的1947年度大十一倍。
    从预算支出的内容来看，这是岸信介政府极力运用国库资金帮助日本垄断资本度过经济危机难关、加紧复活军国主义及向海外实行经济扩张的预算，也是向日本劳动人民生活进攻的预算。
    孝敬垄断资本扼杀中小企业
    今年1月27日岸信介在国会上作施政演说时，强调地说，政府“打算更加努力设法使据说根底浅的我国经济稳定地发展，并且改善我国经济的体质”。日本垄断资本总部“日本经济团体联合会”会长石坂泰三也针对编制预算问题说，日本政府目前应该采取的政策只有两个，一个是振兴出口，一个是改善经济体质。所谓“稳定地发展经济”，就是巩固日本垄断资本的地盘，使它摆脱经济危机的沉重打击，并加强它对日本人民的统治。而“改善经济体质”的具体内容，是：（一）以整顿企业和实行产业“合理化”的手段，加紧掠夺工人阶级，降低生产费用和促进资本集中，排挤和打击中小企业；（二）把财政金融资金向大垄断资本集中，以增强它的实力，维持垄断价格和垄断利润；（三）整顿和扩充垄断资本“共有的财富”的道路、港湾、铁道等交通运输设备。日本垄断资本集团企图通过这样的“经济体质改善”来刺激国内经济和增加在国际市场上的竞争能力。而“振兴出口”，实际上就是对外积极进行经济扩张。从1959年度的财政投资贷款的空前膨胀和增加对日本输出入银行的拨款来看，岸信介政府的新年度预算在尽最大的努力来满足日本垄断资本集团的要求。
    在1959年度预算中，岸信介政府在财政投资贷款方面准备向大企业部门投资和贷款的五千一百九十八亿日元中，用来扩建钢铁、电力、海运、煤矿等大企业设备和以“公共事业费”名义兴修港湾、公路、铁路等交通运输设备的支出，共达二千三百二十多亿日元，比1958年度增加了四百七十五亿日元。光是修建道路和港湾的费用，就增加了三百六十七亿日元，超过了社会保障费或文教、科学振兴费的增加数额。
    岸信介政府在1959年度预算中拨给日本输出入银行的资金，一跃而增加到三百六十亿日元，相当于1958年度的四倍。如果加上原有的资金，这家专门负责开拓海外市场的日本输出入银行在1959年度可以运用的资金将达八百亿日元。这笔资金主要是用来向东南亚国家进行日元贷款、实行延期付款输出和出口成套设备等。此外，在“防卫厅”预算中确定了同战争赔偿有关的经费总额为三百二十三亿日元，比1958年度增加六十一亿日元。因为赔偿是采取实物（主要是生产设备）和“技术援助”的形式，所以岸信介政府拨出的这笔钱，有助于日本垄断资本向东南亚地区扩大商品输出和资本输出。
    由于岸信介政府如此大掏“腰包”，大垄断资本可以有更充裕的资金进行所谓“产业合理化”投资。这样一来，因生产过剩危机加深而产生的一般产业投资缩减情况将会和缓。从今年的设备投资计划来看，许多重要产业部门大体上同去年不相上下甚至略有增长。而且由于大兴土木，整修道路和港湾等工程，钢铁、机器制造和水泥等工业部门还会打开产品的销路，而将刺激国内的需求。至于增加向日本输出入银行的拨款，则表明日本垄断资本在依靠外资的指望不大可能实现的情况下，极力想利用本国财政资本增加经济扩张的实力。总之，这次预算突出地反映日本垄断集团企图加强国家垄断资本主义，仰仗国家的财政资助为摆脱经济危机寻找出路。
    与此相反，尽管岸信介假惺惺地说“要进一步加强从税制和金融方面扶植中小企业的措施”，但是实际上在整个预算中，“中小企业对策费”只有二十二亿日元，占整个预算的千分之一点六，这真像日本俗语所说，像麻雀眼泪一样少得可怜。至于财政投资贷款方面，同大企业有关的日本开发银行、日本输出入银行、电源开发会社等金融机关都显著地增加了投资和贷款。但是，同中小企业有关的中小企业金融公库等则几乎没有增加投资和贷款。
    自从1957年春季日本爆发生产过剩危机以来，由于大垄断资本百般地把危机的后果转嫁给中小企业，中小企业因资金缺乏和销路困难而纷纷倒闭者日见增多。据“读卖新闻”报道，1958年一年内纺织业的中小企业倒闭者达二千余家。今年由于岸信介政府继续执行扼杀中小企业的政策，它们的处境更将艰窘。
    复活军国主义的预算
    岸信介为了加紧复活军国主义和以核武装为中心重整军备，在同美国谈判修改日美“安全条约”的同时，确定了庞大的1959年度军事预算。
    1959年度的“防卫厅”预算总额达一千三百六十亿四千万日元，比1958年度增加了一百五十九亿八千万日元。这笔开支加上驻日美军顾问费、“防卫分担费”共达一千五百三十六亿六千五百万日元。在军事费用增加的情况下，日本陆海空三军都作出了增强兵力和装备的计划。
    这种加强三军装备的计划，为日本的军火工业提供了一个不小的市场。日本“产业经济新闻”最近报道说，1959年是日本军火工业处于转折点的一年。在这一年中，日本将大力制造军舰、喷气式战斗机并试制导弹。生产导弹，是今年日本军火工业的重要目标之一。“防卫厅”已经成立了一个“导弹本部”并拟建“导弹试验部队”。在购卖了瑞士的“厄利康”式导弹之后，日本还准备继续购买美国的“响尾蛇”式和“奈克”式等导弹，以便进行研究和试射。
    军火生产是日本维持垄断资本膨胀的重要来源，又是复活帝国主义的主要支柱。而且，由于军火买主是日本政府，这个市场又是相当稳定的。岸信介政府在1959年度确定这样庞大的军事预算，也是为了想推行经济军事化，以发展军火工业来刺激整个经济，为摆脱危机寻求出路。
    除了庞大的军费开支外，岸信介政府还拨出大笔款子来为复活军国主义活动提供财力。占整个预算6.8％的九百六十七亿五千多万日元的旧军人年金，是供养日本军国主义分子的费用。这笔开支比1958年度增加了一百一十三亿七千多万日元。在教育经费中多达三千二百万日元的“道德教育讲习会经费”，也是用来恢复军国主义教育的。这笔经费比1958年度增加了七倍。此外，1959年度还新设了发给直接执行“勤务评定”制度的各地方教育委员会委员长的“补助费”共计三千八百万日元。
    进一步勒紧人民的裤带
    岸信介政府1959年度预算收入的90％，主要是它从日本人民身上榨取来的血汗税金。至于它以财政投资贷款形式向大垄断资本集中的五千多亿日元中，除了以人民税金构成的国家财政资金外，还把人民的储蓄和公债也拿来孝敬垄断资本。但是，岸信介政府在预算支出中，却百般地剋扣与人民生活福利有关的开支。
    在经济危机影响下，由于资本家连年来大批裁减工人，日本的失业人数不断增加。已登记和未登记的失业人数共达一千万人。但是，1959年度的预算中失业救济费反而被削减了。预算中还减少了穷苦老百姓的“生活保护费”和给“母子家族”（没有父亲的家庭）的福祉贷款额。
    岸信介集团为了骗取选票，大吹大擂地宣传说在这次预算中实现了在去年大选中许下的“减税”的诺言。不错，它宣布要在新的财政年度中减少直接税五百二十五亿日元。但是，另一方面却在间接税方面，以“自然增收”名义在生活困苦的日本人民身上再比上一年度多榨取九百五十三亿日元。即便是减税方面，根据岸信介政府的办法，工资收入低微的家庭不仅得不到好处，反而会因岸信介政府提高公共汽车费、铁路运费、电费等而增加经济负担。
    岸信介集团大事吹嘘的另一件“好事”，是这次预算中增设了一笔总额一百一十亿日元的“国民年金”，说是用来救济无依无靠的老幼残废和孤儿寡妇的。其实，这点钱对于近四百万需要救济的人来说，每人每年平均只分到二千五百多日元（折合我国人民币不足十七元），根本无济于事。再则，“国民年金”是包括在社会保障费内的，由于新设了“国民年金”，其它的社会保障费大大被削减，结果领取生活救济费的人数反而比去年度减少二万三千人，这就使失业问题更加严重。
    岸信介政府的预算通过后，新的财政年度就要开始了。但是，岸信介集团想通过这样一个庞大的预算来加紧复活军国主义和实行经济扩张，其前景并不怎么光明。在日本国内，已经十分严重的生产能力过剩，将因新增加的设备而更形尖锐化，而且“景气过热”有导致通货膨胀的危险。在国外，东南亚人民对日本的潜在帝国主义深怀戒心，同时西欧六国的“共同市场”的实施和实行外汇自由兑换后，“国际商业战”更将激化，日本的经济扩张将碰到更强劲的竞争对手。最后，也是最重要一点，争取走和平中立道路和发展和平经济的广大日本人民日益强大的斗争，将会给日本垄断资本集团的野心以加倍的打击。
