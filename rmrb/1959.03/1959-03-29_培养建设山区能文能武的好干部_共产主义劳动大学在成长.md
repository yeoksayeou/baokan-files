    Cultivating Good Cadres for Mountain Area Development Who Are Skilled in Both Literary and Military Pursuits
    The Communist Labor University Is Growing
    (Our Nanchang dispatch) In order to cultivate talent for the development of mountainous areas, Jiangxi Province established the Communist Labor University last "August 1st." Now it has developed into one main campus, 75 branch campuses, and 52 affiliated labor technical schools, with a total of more than 42,000 students. These schools are distributed in the vast mountainous areas of 82 counties throughout the province and are closely integrated with the more than 150 comprehensive reclamation farms established by cadres transferred to the mountains. The entire university implements the policy of combining education with productive labor in the teaching process and has achieved remarkable results.
    Over the past six months, all the students of the Communist Labor University have greatly improved in terms of ideology, culture, production knowledge, and science and technology through study and labor. Regarding the improvement of ideological awareness, many students in the past did not sufficiently understand the significance of physical labor, but now they are very fond of labor. The school's buildings, equipment, and utensils have all been created by the students through their own labor. In terms of cultural learning, the students study diligently, and their cultural level has improved rapidly. Many students have written their own textbooks, such as Vegetable Cultivation, Botany, Fruit Tree Cultivation, and Agricultural Enterprise Management, based on their own production experience and labor practice. The content is both accessible and applicable. There have been even greater gains in production knowledge and science and technology. In the past, much industrial production knowledge was unfamiliar to the students, but now many students have mastered techniques such as building furnaces, batching ingredients, watching the fire color, and tapping molten iron in steel production; they have learned oil extraction, winemaking, fiber manufacturing, rosin processing, and timber processing; and some have also learned techniques in civil engineering such as drilling holes, blasting, building chutes and cableways. In agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, they have learned many things they had never learned before, such as raising sheep and rabbits, and identifying, collecting, and utilizing wild oilseeds and wild fibers. In particular, many students have made many inventions and creations through production practice. For example, students at the main campus successfully tested gibberellin, which can accelerate plant growth; students at the Jinggangshan branch made cement; students at the Huanggangshan branch made high explosives and locust-killing fogging agents using indigenous methods; some branch campuses made bamboo slide rails, bamboo curve radius testers, and dragonfly-type slide automatic unloading devices; and some improved the formula for the sag and safety factor of steel cableways. As the students' production knowledge and labor skills have improved, they have established 37 farms, 141 factories, 17 forest farms, and 51 livestock farms in the mountainous areas within half a year, cultivating a total area of more than 140,000 mu. The people in the mountainous areas greatly admire them and say, "These students are skilled in both literary and military pursuits and are truly university students of our workers and peasants."
    The establishment of the Communist Labor University has even more far-reaching significance and effects for Jiangxi. It has enabled more workers and peasants to receive education; at the same time, it has laid a good foundation for the cultural and technical revolution in the mountainous areas, enabling it to cultivate all-round talents for the development of the mountainous areas more quickly and greatly promote the development of production in the mountainous areas.

    培养建设山区能文能武的好干部
    共产主义劳动大学在成长
    本报南昌讯　江西省为培养建设山区的人才，在去年“八一”创办的共产主义劳动大学，现在已经发展到总校一所，分校七十五所，各分校附属劳动技术学校五十二所，学生总计达四万二千余人。这些学校分布在全省八十二个县的广大山区中，和全省下放干部在山区建立的一百五十多个综合垦殖场紧密结合在一起，全校在教学过程中，贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，取得了显著的成就。
    共产主义劳动大学的全体学生们，经过半年来的学习和劳动，在思想、文化、生产知识与科学技术等方面，都获得了很大的提高。在思想觉悟的提高方面，过去许多学生对体力劳动的意义认识不足，现在非常热爱劳动，学校的校舍、设备和用具，都是学生们用自己的双手劳动创造的。在文化学习方面，学生们刻苦学习，文化水平提高得很快。有许多同学根据自己的生产经验和劳动实践，自己编写出蔬菜栽培学、植物学、果树栽培学、农业企业管理学等等课本。内容既通俗又适用。在生产知识和科学技术方面，收获更大。过去许多工业生产知识对学生们来说是很生疏的，现在许多同学掌握了钢铁生产中建炉、配料、看火色、放铁水等技术；学会了榨油、酿酒、制造纤维、松脂加工、木材加工等生产；还有的学会了土木建筑工程中的打眼、放炮、炸滩、建筑滑道和索道等技术。在农林牧副渔五业方面，更学到了许多过去从未学过的东西，比如养羊、养兔，对野生油料和野生纤维的识别和采集利用等。特别是许多学生通过生产实践，有了许多创造发明。例如，总校学生试验成功了能加速植物生长的赤霉素，井冈山分校学生试制成了水泥，黄岗山分校学生用土法制成烈性炸药和灭蝗烟雾剂；还有的分校制成了竹滑轨道、竹制曲线半径测定器和蜻蜓式滑道自动卸材器，有的改进了钢索道垂度与安全系数公式等。随着全校学生生产知识和劳动技能的提高，半年内即在山区举办起农场三十七个，工厂一百四十一个，林场十七个，畜牧场五十一个，共经营耕地面积十四万多亩。山区的人民群众十分赞佩地说：“这些学生能文能武，真是我们工人农民的大学生。”
    共产主义劳动大学的兴办，对江西来说，还有着更为深远的意义和作用。它使更多的工农群众受到了教育；同时，为山区的文化技术革命奠定了良好的基础，能更快地培养建设山区的全面发展的人才和大大促进了山区生产的发展。
