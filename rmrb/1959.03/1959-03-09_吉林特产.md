Jilin Specialties

	Jiaohe Sun-Cured Tobacco

	The sun-cured tobacco grown in Jiaohe County was introduced from Luzon in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and then cultivated in the Jiaohe area by coastal provinces of China during the late Ming Dynasty. After hundreds of years of cultivation and improvement, it has become one of China's famous sun-cured tobaccos. Jiaohe sun-cured tobacco is characterized by: large leaves, thick flesh, and a mellow aroma; it is resistant to humidity, does not extinguish easily, and does not lose its flavor. In the Qing Dynasty, it was selected as a tribute gift. Jiaohe sun-cured tobacco is widely sold in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, and Liaoning, and is very popular among the masses.

	Artificially Cultivated Mushrooms

	In people's minds, mushrooms are a wild plant that grows on trees or in the ground. However, the Changchun Municipal Vegetable Procurement Station has cultivated a type of artificial mushroom in greenhouses using horse manure, rice straw, gypsum powder, and superphosphate. This mushroom has high nutritional value and a delicious taste.

	To allow people to eat fresh mushrooms in winter, the Changchun Municipal Vegetable Procurement Station built a 100-square-meter greenhouse for cultivation. Now, five or six jin can be harvested every day.

	Beishan Walking Sticks

	Beishan, located on the banks of the Songhua River, is famous not only for its beautiful scenery but also for its famous Jilin Beishan walking sticks. People who visit Beishan often purchase these walking sticks as souvenirs.

	Jilin Beishan walking sticks have a history of more than thirty years. They are made by hand using a type of tree known locally as "old grouse eye" as the main raw material, which grows on Beishan. There are many types, including straight handles, curved handles, ox horn curved handles, ox horn knob handles, bamboo joint handles, twisted flower handles, and unattached handle walking sticks, totaling twenty or thirty varieties. Their designs are beautiful, with natural patterns and colors, as well as artificially created patterns and colors. All walking sticks have the characteristics of a tight straight mouth, no head-dropping, round stick, durable without bending, and unbreakable.

	Beishan walking sticks are not only popular in the domestic market but are also sold to Mongolia, Korea, and Japan. Last year, a total of two thousand walking sticks were exported. This year, another two thousand walking sticks will be exported to Southeast Asia and other countries.

	Jilin Tiger

	The Jilin tiger is one of Jilin Province's important specialties. This tiger is large and slender, fierce and strong, with thick and beautiful fur, its entire body being orange or brown with black transverse stripes. The lower jaw, abdomen, and inside of the limbs are all white. There is also a white stripe of fur above the eyes, and the long tail has ten black rings. The fur around its body is long and smooth, and the winter tiger fur is twice as long as the summer fur. Therefore, people also call it "long-haired tiger."

	Jilin tigers mostly mate in winter, producing cubs every two to three years, with two to four cubs per litter. The gestation period is about one hundred days. The cubs will grow up after three or four years.

	The Jilin tiger is very valuable. Tiger bones, tiger meat, tiger blood, etc., are all valuable Chinese medicinal materials; tiger skins can be used as mattresses, which are beautiful and practical. (Attached image)
