Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 13th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in Parliament today that US military aid to Pakistan "fuels the aggressiveness of the Pakistani authorities and intensifies tensions and conflicts between India and Pakistan."

	He said, "Based on past experience, the continuous threats from Pakistan and Pakistan's interpretation of the recent (military) agreement concluded with the United States make it difficult for us to ignore the possibility that Pakistan will use the aid it receives from other countries to deal with India."

	He also said that while the assurances of the US authorities are welcome, "the broader interpretation of the agreement made by the Pakistani authorities is a matter of serious concern to us." He said the Indian government has asked the US authorities to "further clarify their attitude in this regard."

	Congress will debate the US-Pakistan bilateral military agreement when the Indian Foreign Ministry's budget is brought up for discussion at the end of the month. The "Delhi Times" weekly wrote in its latest issue that Indian politicians unanimously believe that "this treaty is a direct military threat to India" and "people are beginning to greatly distrust the Washington government." The weekly also said: "It is becoming increasingly clear that the Washington government is creating discord, disunity and quarrels among Asian and African countries," and "the Americans have become the biggest enemies of the principles of coexistence and cooperation."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 13th: Members of Parliament from various Indian political parties expressed unanimous indignation in the People's House on the 12th at the incidents of Pakistani attacks on the Indian border. They considered these incidents to be part of a "carefully planned conspiracy."

	Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a meeting in the People's House specifically to discuss this issue that the Indian government is "very concerned" about this situation and the "entire background behind the incidents," and the government will take preventive measures.

	Nehru said that India has discovered that Pakistanis used US weapons in attempted sabotage activities in Kashmir, including radio transmitters, radio receivers, and certain types of bombs.

	Nehru said that since he recently made a statement on the US-Pakistan military agreement, the Indian government has continued to discuss this issue with the US authorities. He wants to present to Parliament some documents regarding the assurances obtained by the Indian government and a copy of the US-Pakistan military agreement. He said the Indian government will continue to question the US authorities. He said that the assurances made by the US authorities that the US-Pakistan military agreement has absolutely no connection with any Pakistani plan to attack India cannot be "completely satisfactory, because the other party not only does not give such assurances, but also makes statements to the contrary."

	Indian Communist Party leader Mukherjee pointed out that "Pakistan would never dare to be so arrogant without the aid, money and missile bases given to it by the United States." He demanded that the Indian government lodge a protest in the United Nations against Pakistan's continued attacks on the border. Communist Party member Banerjee also demanded that the government lodge a protest in the United Nations because "Pakistan's rifles firing American bullets are ultimately a dangerous thing." Guha of the Congress Party called on the government to recruit militias to protect the border.

    尼赫鲁指责美巴军事协定
    美国加剧印巴紧张局势
    印度议员谴责巴基斯坦用美国武器攻击边界
    新华社新德里13日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天在国会中发言时说，美国对巴基斯坦的军事援助“助长巴基斯坦当局的侵略性，并且加剧印度和巴基斯坦之间的紧张局势和冲突”。
    他说，“根据过去的经验，巴基斯坦的继续不断的威胁以及巴基斯坦对最近同美国缔结的（军事）协定的解释，我们就很难忽视巴基斯坦利用它从别国获得的援助来对付印度的可能性。”
    他又说，虽然美国当局的保证是值得欢迎的，但是，“巴基斯坦当局对协定所作的较广义的解释是我们严重关切的问题”。他说，印度政府已经要求美国当局“进一步阐明这方面的态度”。
    国会将在印度外交部的预算在月底提出来讨论的时候，辩论美巴双边军事协定。“德里时代”周报在最近一期中写道，印度政界人士一致认为，“这个条约是对印度的直接军事威胁”，“人们开始非常不信任华盛顿政府”。这家周报还说：“越来越明显，华盛顿政府正在亚非国家中制造不和、不团结和争吵”，“美国人已经成为共处和合作原则的最大敌人”。
    新华社新德里13日电　印度各政党的议员12日在人民院对巴基斯坦攻击印度边界事件一致表示愤慨，他们认为这些事件是“周密策划的阴谋”的一部分。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在人民院专门讨论这个问题的会议上说，印度政府“非常关心”这种情况以及“事件后面的整个背景”，政府将采取防范性的措施。
    尼赫鲁说，印度发觉，巴基斯坦人在克什米尔进行未遂的破坏活动中使用了美国武器，这些武器包括无线电发报机，无线电收音机和某种炸弹。
    尼赫鲁说，自从他最近就美巴军事协定发表谈话以来，印度政府一直继续同美国当局讨论这个问题，他想向议会提出关于印度政府所获得的保证的某种文件和美巴军事协定的副本。他说，印度政府将继续追问美国当局。他说，美国当局所作的关于美巴军事协定同巴基斯坦进攻印度的任何计划绝无联系的保证，不能“完全令人满意，因为另一方非但不作这种保证，而且发表了与此相反的言论。”
    印度共产党领袖慕克吉指出，“巴基斯坦没有美国给它的援助、金钱和导弹基地”，决不敢如此狂妄，他要求印度政府在联合国提出抗议，抗议巴基斯坦继续在边境上进行攻击。共产党议员班纳吉也要求政府在联合国中提出抗议，因为“巴基斯坦的步枪发射美国的子弹终究是危险的事情。”国大党的古哈要求政府募集民兵来保护边境。
