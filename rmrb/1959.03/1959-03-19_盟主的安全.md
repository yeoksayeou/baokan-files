Title: The Security of the Hegemon

The matter of contracting for the production of two turbines between the United States and Britain "has caused a great uproar beyond mere business dealings" (People's Daily, March 11th). This event is very helpful for us to understand the essence of the "US-UK alliance."

According to the US side, rejecting the bid of the British Electric Company was for the sake of US security interests. The British side was very dissatisfied, believing this was an excuse to exclude and discriminate against Britain. Therefore, the British ambassador to the United States loudly exclaimed in Washington: "I think it is difficult for anyone to believe that entrusting the manufacturing of two turbines to Britain, an ally of the United States, would threaten the security of the entire United States." Both statements seem to be "each for its own master," with each side having its own reasons. Comparing them, the British ambassador's "reasoning" seems somewhat naive.

Capitalist countries are concentrated to serve the big bourgeoisie. To harm the interests of the big bosses is to threaten national security. As for the enterprises that are the lifeblood of the bosses, they are naturally related to "national security." The ambassador probably understands what his most fundamental task is, otherwise two turbines would not have caused a diplomatic dispute. So, the Americans say that the normal operation of the equipment of American companies is related to national security interests. Therefore, to "national security", they take away the two turbines from the British bosses and give them to this American company that manufactures giant machinery. Isn't that also perfectly justified?

Therefore, the crux of the problem is not whether the American excuse is legitimate, but that the essence of the problem reflects the unequal relationship between the two partners in the "US-UK alliance." The British annoyance is because they have been oppressed by the hegemon and feel unfair: You Americans can open more than 250 subsidiaries in our Britain, investing nearly 2 billion US dollars, penetrating manufacturing, petroleum, mining and smelting to public utilities and trade departments. Even five-thirds of the kettles, more than half of the refrigerators, a large number of medicines, beverages, cars and auto parts used by us British are products of your American companies. Your products can flood our British market, you can swallow up our entire British Aluminum Company; so why can't our British companies even contract to manufacture your two turbines? If two turbines threaten the national security of the United States, then wouldn't the above-mentioned threaten the security of our British Empire even more? Only the hegemon is allowed to set fires, and the partner is not allowed to light lamps. Can this still be considered an ally? Aren't you bullying us too much?

The British ambassador's words reflect that the British, sitting in the second seat in the capitalist world, are unwilling to be completely manipulated. It is said that some British people believe that Dulles and Eisenhower are old and sick and unable to assume the great responsibility of leading the Western world, and are urging Macmillan to take the opportunity to "play a greater leading role"; at the very least, they want to achieve some equality with the Americans. However, in the eyes of the Americans who pursue hegemony, the so-called "US-UK alliance" is nothing more than an alliance between the master sitting in the sedan chair and the coolies carrying the sedan chair. When carrying the sedan chair, not only the sedan chair pole of the master is related to the master's safety, but also the back of the coolie is related to the master's safety. For the masters, even if the coolie is crushed to death, the master cannot be thrown. The security of the hegemon is important, and the life of the hegemonic slave is not worth anything. Here, even the "equality" flaunted by the bourgeoisie is impossible.

The dispute over the two turbines more or less exposed the inside story of the US-UK alliance. From the US side, it is about how to control the hegemonic slaves more tightly, while from the British side, it is about how to break free from the oppression of the hegemon and obtain some equal rights. That's why it caused a "great uproar" "beyond mere business dealings." This "uproar" can only intensify, but cannot disappear. It is indeed true to the old saying: "One wave has not subsided, another wave rises."

### 盟主的安全

    盟主的安全
    董逢亚
    为承制两部涡轮机的事，美英之间，“引起了一场超乎生意经以外的轩然大波”（3月11日人民日报）。这件事很有助于我们认识“美英联盟”的实质。
    据美国方面讲，拒绝英国电气公司的投标，是为了美国安全的利益。而英国方面很不服气，认为这是排挤歧视英国的借口。因此，英国驻美国大使就在华盛顿大声叫喊：“我觉得任何人都很难相信，如果把两只涡轮机交给美国的盟友英国去制造，就会使美国整个国家的安全受到威胁”。两种说法，看来都是“各为其主”，公说公有理，婆说婆有理。比较一下，英国大使的“理”，多少还有点天真。
    资本主义国家，是集中为大资产阶级服务的。要是损伤到大老板的利益，就是威胁到了国家安全，至于作为老板们命根子的企业，自然更是与“国家安全”有关的了。大使先生大概也明白他最根本的任务是什么，否则两部涡轮机，也就不会引起外交争执。那末，美国人说，美国公司的机器设备正常运转关系到国家安全利益，因而为了“国家安全”，便把两部涡轮机从英国老板手里夺过来、交给美国这家制造巨型机件的公司，岂不也是名正言顺的么？
    因此，问题的症结倒不在于美国人的借口是否正当，而在于这个问题的实质，反映了“美英联盟”中两个伙伴的不平等关系。英国人的气恼，就是因为他们受到了来自盟主方面的压迫，内心感到这样的不平：你们美国佬，在我们英国可以开设二百五十多家的子公司，投资高达近二十亿美元，浸透到加工制造、石油、开采溶炼直到公用事业和贸易各部门，甚至，我们英国人使用的五分之三的家用水壶，一半以上的冰箱，大量的药品、饮料、汽车和汽车配件，都是你们美国公司的产品，你们的产品可以在我们英国市场泛滥成灾，你们可以把我们英国制铝公司全部吞并；而我们英国的公司为什么连你们的两部涡轮机也不能承制呢？如果说两部涡轮机威胁到你美国的国家安全，那末，上述种种，岂不是更要威胁我们大英帝国的安全吗？只许盟主放火，不许伙计点灯，这还能算得上盟友，你们岂不也欺人太甚了吗？
    英国大使的话反映出坐在资本主义世界中第二把交椅上的英国人，不愿完全甘心受摆布。听说，有些英国人认为目前杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔一病一老，不堪担当西方世界首领的大任，而促使麦克米伦乘机“发挥更大的主导作用”；起码，他们是想同美国人取得一点平等。但是，在奉行霸道的美国人眼里看来，所谓“美英联盟”，又只不过是坐轿子的主子和抬轿子的奴才的联盟。抬着轿子的时候，不仅老爷的轿杆，关系到老爷的安全，就是轿夫的脊背也关系到老爷的安全。对老爷们来说，即是压死轿夫，也不能摔了老爷。盟主的安全要紧，盟奴的身家性命是算不得了什么的。在这里，就连资产阶级标榜的那种“平等”也是不能有的。
    两部涡轮机的争执，多多少少暴露出美英联盟的内幕。在美国方面来说，是如何把盟奴控制得更紧，而在英国方面来说，是如何挣脱盟主的压迫，取得一些平等权利，因此才引起“超乎生意经以外”的“轩然大波”。这“波”只能变本加厉，却无法消逝，真是应了“一波未平一波又起”的老话了。
