    One Equals Ten
    —Literary Appreciation Essays
    Wang Chaowen
    A笊篱 (zhào lí), a tool for scooping things. In the northern villages and towns, I
  have seen it more than once, hanging at the entrance of noodle shops. Just like
  noodles made from red cloth strips, it becomes a visual signboard. Because it has a close connection with noodles, its prominent appearance at the entrance of noodle shops is not only a sign but also a potential lure. It lures travelers who need to fill their stomachs, generating corresponding associations and imaginations.
      When viewed as a signboard, is the image of the 笊篱 (zhào lí) less complete than noodles made from red cloth strips? Is its content less clearly expressed than the latter? Not necessarily. Even the latter cannot explain everything. It seems that people do not expect it to explain everything either. Using the 笊篱 (zhào lí) as a signboard is a form of artistic creation, but it also has similarities to artistic creation. Artistic creation consists of real life, the artist's labor, and the needs of the appreciator. Only in connection with the appreciator's feelings and influence can we judge the artistic quality of thought and skill.
    No art can explain everything, nor does it need to. One of the artist's skills lies in adapting to the vast appreciators' life experiences, emotional memories, aesthetic requirements, appreciation habits…, shaping images that are easy to understand yet capable of evoking corresponding re-creative psychological activities, allowing people to be influenced by healthy thoughts and feelings. Last year in Chongqing, I listened to an interesting Quyi program. It described an arrogant cat, fantasizing itself as a tiger in every way, the invincible king of beasts. In the end, it couldn't withstand a light blow from reality, and its good dream of self-admiration shattered. This Quyi program, which is somewhat like a fairy tale and somewhat like a caricature, is similar to some people's character only in the aspect of arrogance, not in all aspects, when viewed as a re-creation of life's image. One of the important benefits of these programs is their ability to prompt appreciators to associate from one point to others. In front of these interesting images, appreciators are not simply accepting propaganda, but also exploring, discovering, and supplementing, gaining the pleasure of appreciation
  (including worrying for the ancients). Because appreciators explore, discover, and supplement, the influence of the work's theme also becomes more profound.
    Recently, I saw a painting draft with a scene that wasn't very large, but it felt rich in content. It depicts the flesh-and-blood connection between the Chinese and Korean people, starting from seemingly trivial but not insignificant aspects of life. The only figure in the picture is an old Korean woman. She is mending military uniforms for the Chinese People's Volunteers. Where have the Chinese People's Volunteers gone? Are they on a mission and haven't returned yet? The painter doesn't explain to us, and it seems there is no need to particularly say. In the room, only three bundles, three satchels, and three water cups are left. The three water cups are placed on the brazier in front of the old woman, with steam rising from the water in the cups. This is what the old woman is preparing for them; she is waiting for the volunteers as she awaits the return of her sons. In this painting draft, the things expressed by images are very limited, but it contains a lot of content. In this painting draft, loftiness and greatness are not externally added concepts, but a spirit revealed in ordinary people and events. This kind of painting draft, which does not directly depict the actions of the volunteers, but only describes the influence of their actions, focusing on the spiritual outlook of the characters and emphasizing the beauty in life, can evoke a lot of imagination in the appreciators. Isn't it more moving and complete than those large-scale, detailed works that are unfortunately just flat narrations of life's phenomena, just in terms of the praise of internationalism spirit? A flat but detailed narration of life's phenomena may conceal the author's ignorance and indifference towards life, but it cannot achieve a stirring effect.
    Even today, there are still audiences who demand that art narrate everything, and there are still artists who demand that art re-create everything. Demanding a series of pictures from sculpture, demanding a multi-act play from sculpture, demanding a novel from sculpture, is not only because they do not understand the strengths and limitations of sculpture, but also because they do not understand the difference between art and life. If the demands on art violate the characteristics of art, then the necessity of the existence of portrait paintings that do not narrate actions and landscape paintings that do not depict people in action, all art, can be questioned. Isn't it? Compared to the complex reality itself, isn't it too "incomplete"? However, an important characteristic of artistic creation is from complexity to simplicity. The simplified artistic image can have a big difference from life itself. Using uplifting music (such as a chorus) to express a character's inward emotional state, such as deep thought, is to approach real life by focusing on the description of emotional excitement. Demanding that the images in creation be the same as the materials inevitably cancels art. Precisely because art does not have to be a replication of life, just drawing firecrackers and red lanterns, adding words, the appreciator may be brought into the illusion of a lively New Year; just drawing a dried lotus seedpod and a dragonfly may make the appreciator imagine the clear and refreshing scenery of autumn; just drawing the calm state of a hero refusing to confess before execution, the viewer can associate it with a stormy and enthusiastic struggle. If we understand the principle that art is a reflection of life from a formal rather than an essential perspective, the method of painting bamboo with vermilion can be said to be formalism; the performance of using singing instead of speaking is abnormal nonsense; aesthetic knowledge about craftsmanship and architecture (using the formal sense of special shapes to reflect the people's feelings, and using this reflection to influence the people) may also be seen as empty talk divorced from reality.
    Achieving more with less and inferring from this to that are also signs of artistic skill. Especially the visual arts, which can only re-create reality from one aspect of life rather than all aspects. Any scene or plot is only part of the whole, and the important thing is whether it can summarize other parts. Artists must be good at choosing the most representative phenomena and emphasizing some of their characteristics. One of the reasons why it is difficult to be an artist is whether they can discover the intrinsic meaning of things, form novel themes, and, in order to adapt to novel themes and fit specific art forms, choose the most representative phenomena, and shape images that do not fall into clichés, that is, to typify. An artist who cannot typically reflect reality cannot be considered a talented artist.
    The power of the typical lies in making people associate from this one in the work to those many others. This one is the result of the artist's understanding of life, and also the starting point for the appreciator's re-understanding of life. The appreciator can infer from one instance to many, and this one in art should be equal to ten. "In the hands of a talented writer, every character is a type; for the reader, every type is a familiar stranger." Belinsky's sentence can be given a tangible explanation in modern Chinese works. The movie "Two Salesmen," although it still has obvious shortcomings, like the painting draft and Quyi mentioned earlier, just expresses the relationship between the general and the specific, so it may universally have a positive impact on people. The young salesman who is criticized by the author with a friendly attitude, the young man who is accustomed to the working methods and systems of urban stores, and does not understand the characteristics of rural life, we feel strange as a salesman in a grocery store in a remote rural area; however, we feel familiar with his self-righteous, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses words and deeds in terms of the nature of his thoughts. Because this young man not only represents the salesmen who are transferred from the city to remote rural areas, but also represents the revolutionaries in all walks of life who still have problems in their thinking style. After the audience sees his ridiculous words and deeds and laughs, they may feel their faces burning, feeling that the role they just ridiculed also contains their own shortcomings. Although he cannot replace other people, he also represents many people.
    Art that serves socialism, just in terms of the images of the characters, must also be colorful. If everyone only chooses the same aspect, even if it is the most important, drawing it over and over again, and the drawing methods are almost the same, the audience will inevitably feel bored and find it difficult to evoke new imagination. How can we shape this one that is both specific and universal? Or, how can we find the most representative, that is, the so-called most comprehensive, posture, language, and expression from the complex phenomena of life? There is no other way, only to see more and see through. The complexity of reality and the diversity of the needs of the masses provide a prerequisite for bold originality for talented and hardworking artists. To reveal significant meaning from the reflection of ordinary phenomena requires higher skills and outstanding vision. However, some artists who treat the subject matter as the theme, artists who think that sketching exercises can replace typification, have not yet explored life and hurriedly put down his magnifying glass and ended his labor. Not focusing on reflecting the character's personality, especially the character's individuality, only using brush and ink on general phenomena, taking architecture as the subject matter and only drawing the construction scene, taking steelmaking as the subject matter and only drawing the scene of steel production, just like taking manure accumulation as the subject matter and focusing on describing manure accumulation, it is not that the author does not know the importance of creating characters in a novel way, the difficulty lies in the fact that he has no idea in his mind. Because there are countless things in the heart, only work hard on some phenomena that are not conducive to shaping typicals and whose images are easily generalized, and even repeat other people's established creations.
    How to reflect from all aspects of reality and create typical characters full of personality, there are many examples in traditional drama for painters to refer to. Even if it is to embody the same concept, for example, to ridicule the lack of resilience in life attitude, the Peking opera "Water Splashed Before the Horse" and the Hubei Baling opera "Night Dream Crown Wearing", which take the wife of Zhu Maichen, Cui, wanting to restore the relationship with her husband as the subject matter, are completely different aspects of life. The former focuses on the fact that Cui asked Zhu Maichen, who became an official, to take her in and was humiliated on the street. The latter describes Cui dreaming, dreaming that her husband Zhu Maichen, whom she used to look down on, sent someone to welcome her; the playwright starts from the description of people's subconscious activities and conducts a subtle but sharp criticism of the qualities and thoughts of some people. As far as Cui's life is concerned, both of these dramas are the aftermath of the conflict, but it can also reveal the character's personality and is easy to embody a specific theme. It can be seen that the creation of art has a very free world. The character loved by the people, such as wisdom, has also been given ever-changing manifestations in traditional opera. In terms of the expression of this advantage, "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats" and "Empty City Stratagem", which are led by Zhuge Liang himself, are very good, and "Yellow Crane Tower", which is not directly led by him, is not bad either.
    One equals ten is relative. This one can represent others, but it does not replace others. In order to praise women's struggle for freedom, it is not only Bai Suzhen who takes up armed struggle who is the most moving and meaningful. Wang Baochuan, who broke up with her father, Zhu Yingtai, who died on her lover's grave, Mu Guiying, who chose her lover in battle, and Du Liniang, who saw her lover in a dream, have great differences in their specific situations, but they are all very moving and meaningful images. In opera, there are many women who are harmed and rise up to fight, and they have a common characteristic—no compromise. Their personalities, the specific circumstances of their harm, the objects of struggle, and the ways of struggle vary greatly. Du Shiniang uses what Li Jia cares about most (wealth) to humiliate Li Jia; Qin Xianglian relies on the social forces that are conducive to the struggle when counterattacking Chen Shimei; Jiao of "Three Times on the Sedan Chair" endured temporary humiliation, and went to worship the enemy with a short knife in her arms; Jiao Guiying did not win when she was alive, and continued to fight even after becoming a ghost.
    Without the special, there is no general; Li Huiniang, who was ravaged by feudal forces, her personality and situation are not like Xier and Xiao Feie, not like Zhu Yingtai and Bai Suzhen, not like all the typicals of women who demand freedom, it is not the shortcoming of "Red Plum Pavilion" but its advantage. Precisely because Li Huiniang is different from others, she will not be replaced by the typical women in other works of art. Li Huiniang is not like Xiao Feie who originally had a lover, not like Xier who originally had a lover, and revealed her desire to change the status quo (even if she herself does not understand what it means) when she saw the strange but admired young man Pei Sheng while visiting West Lake, which does not detract from the anti-feudal significance of the work. It cannot be said that Jia Sidao's desire to seize other people's fiancées like Huang Shiren is a crime, and hindering people's freedom by relying on legal status is not a crime. Furthermore, it cannot be said that Li Huiniang should fight back against her enemies if she originally had a lover, and she should be killed by Jia Sidao if she did not have a lover. Regardless of when things happen or whether the person concerned's understanding is clear, Li Huiniang is not comfortable with the situation where her freedom is hindered and desires to obtain true love, and its nature does not change with the complexity of specific situations. Just as Yao An killed Lüe and Xiao Fang killed Cui Niang, the motives for killing their wives are not exactly the same, but in terms of despising women's personality, there is no fundamental difference. If we force this one woman Li Huiniang to look up to other women, only wanting generality and not specificity, then, it cannot be explained in other words, it can only be said that the simplification of life and the generalization of the content of art. It is not expanding the field of art's subject matter, but narrowing its field.
    In order to adapt to the diverse requirements of art appreciators, reflecting reality can only start from many aspects. The typification required by art is not the simplification of real life. Focusing on describing the character's actions may shape the typical, not writing about the character's actions, only borrowing from the description of its influence, may also shape the typical. Putting effort on minor characters does not necessarily mean trying to avoid the focus of life, not in order to focus on the expression of the main characters. A certain aspect of the personality is emphasized, for example, the little nun in "Thinking of the World", focusing on her uneasiness with her unfortunate status quo and focusing on her fantasy about a happy future in the performance, can be a powerful anti-feudal image, and may be a complete image. I hope that in the field of art, there are not fewer but more representative and original images.

    一以当十
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
    王朝闻
    笊篱，捞东西的用具。在北方的村镇，我
  不只一次看见它，悬挂在面食店的门首。正如
  用红布条来做的面条，成了以视觉形象见长的幌子。因为它和面食有过密切的联系，在面食
  店门首引人注目地出现，不只是一种标志，而且可能是一种诱惑。它诱惑需要充饥的旅人，产生相应的联想和想像。
      当成幌子来看，笊篱的形象，是不是不如红布条作成的面条完整呢？它的内容，是不是不如后者表现得明确呢？不见得。即令是后者，也不能说明一切。看样子人们也不企图要它说明一切。把笊篱当成幌子，不就是艺术的创作，但也和艺术创作有相似的地方。艺术创作，是生活实际、艺术家的劳动、欣赏者的需要组成的。只有联系着欣赏者的感受和影响，才能够判断艺术的思想和技巧的高低。
    任何艺术，都不能说明一切，也不必说明一切。艺术家的本领之一，在于适应广大欣赏者的生活经验、情绪记忆、审美要求、欣赏习惯……，塑造出容易了解却又是能够唤起相应的再创造的心理活动的形象，让人们受到健康的思想感情的影响。去年我在重庆，听了一个有趣的曲艺节目。描写妄自尊大的猫，从各方面把自己幻想为老虎，所向无敌的兽中王。最后经不起事实轻轻一击，自我欣赏的好梦破灭了。有点像童话也有点像讽刺画的这一曲艺节目，当成再现生活的形象来看，它不过是在妄自尊大这一点，而不是在各方面，和某些人的性格相接近的。能够促使欣赏者由某一点联想到其他，是这些节目的重要好处之一。在这种有趣的形象之前，欣赏者不是简单地接受宣传，同时也是一种探索、发现和补充，得到欣赏的乐趣
  （包括为古人担心）。因为欣赏者有所探索，有所发现和补充，作品的主题的影响也更深入。
    最近看了一幅场面并不大，看起来觉得内容丰富的画稿。表现中朝人民血肉相联的关系，是从似乎琐碎而意义并不琐碎的生活侧面着手的。画面上唯一的人物，是一位朝鲜老大娘。她在给中国人民志愿军补军衣。中国人民志愿军不知到那儿去了，是执行任务还没有回来吗？画家没有向我们说明，似乎也不必特别说出。屋里只留下三个被包，三个挎包，三个水杯。三个水杯就放在老大娘面前的火盆上面，水杯里的水正在冒着热气。这是老大娘为他们准备着的，她像期待儿子归来一样在期待着志愿军。在这幅画稿里，用形象来表现的东西很有限，可是它包含了许多内容。在这种画稿里，崇高和伟大，不是外加进去的概念，而是平平凡凡的人物和事件中透露出来的一种精神。没有直接描写志愿军的行动，只描写他们的行动的影响的这种画稿，从人物的精神面貌着眼，着重表现生活中的美，能够引起欣赏者很多想像的这种画稿，单就国际主义精神的歌颂来看，不是较之那些规模不小，画得很细致，可惜不过是生活现象的平板叙述的作品更动人也更完整吗？生活现象的平板的但也是详尽的叙述，可能掩盖作者对于生活的无知和冷淡，却不能够得到令人心情激动的效果。
    至今也还有要求艺术叙述一切的观众，也还有要求艺术再现一切的艺术家。向雕刻提出连环图画的要求，向雕刻提出多幕剧的要求，向雕刻提出长篇小说的要求，不只因为不了解雕刻的特长和局限性，也因为不了解艺术与生活的区别。如果对艺术提出的要求违反艺术的特征，那末，不叙述行动的肖像画和不描写人在活动的风景画，一切艺术，其存在的必要性都可怀疑。不是吗？它和复杂的现实本身比较，不是太“不完整”了吗？可是艺术创作的重要特征，是由复杂到单纯。单纯化的艺术形象，和生活本身可以有很大的区别。运用高亢的音乐（例如帮腔）来表现人物深思之类的内向的情绪状态，是从情绪激动这一点的着重描写，来和生活实际相接近的。要求创作里的形象和素材一样，难免取消艺术。正因为艺术不必是生活的复制，只画爆竹和红灯，题上字，欣赏者也可能被带进热闹的过年的幻境；只画一个干枯了的莲蓬和一只蜻蜓，可能使欣赏者想像出秋高气爽的景色；只画临刑前拒绝忏悔的英雄的冷静状态，看画的人联想得到狂风暴雨般的热烈斗争。要是不从本质上而是从形式上了解艺术是生活的反映这一原则，用朱色来画竹子的办法可以说是形式主义的；用歌唱代替说话的表演是精神状态不正常的胡闹；有关工艺和建筑的美学知识（利用特殊的造型的形式感来反映人民的感情，而又用这种反映来影响人民），也可能被看成是脱离实际的空谈。
    以少胜多和由此及彼，也是艺术技巧的标志。特别是造型艺术，它只能是从生活的某一侧面而不是一切侧面来再现现实的。任何场面任何情节都不过是构成整体的一部分，重要的是它能不能够概括其他的部分。艺术家要善于选择最富于代表性的现象，而且着重它的某些特征。艺术家难做的原因之一，就在于能不能发现事物的内在意义，形成新颖的主题，而且为了适应新颖的主题，切合特定艺术样式，选择最富于代表性的现象，塑造不落陈套的形象，也就是典型化。不会典型地反映现实，不能算是有才能的艺术家。
    典型的力量在于使人由作品里的这一个联想到那许多。这一个是艺术家认识生活的结果，也就是欣赏者再认识生活的出发点。欣赏者可以举一反三，艺术的这一个应当是一以当十的。“在有才能的作家的笔下，每个人物都是典型；对于读者，每一个典型都是熟识的陌生人。”别林斯基的这句话，在现代中国的作品中可以得到有形的解释。电影“两个营业员”，虽然还有分明的缺点，但它和前面提到过的画稿、曲艺一样，恰好表现了一般与特殊的关系，因而它可能普遍使人们受到积极的影响。作者持了友善的态度在批判的青年营业员，那个习惯于城市商店工作方式和制度，不明白农村生活特点的青年，作为偏僻农村中的杂货店的营业员来看，我们感到陌生；可是，他那些自以为是，脱离实际，脱离群众的言行，就思想的性质而论，我们感到熟识。因为这个青年不只代表了由城市调到偏僻的农村的营业员，而且代表了各行各业里在思想作风上还有毛病的革命者。当观众看到他那可笑的言行而笑了之后，可能脸热，感到刚才自己嘲笑过的角色里，也包含了自己的缺点在内。他虽然代替不了别的人，却也代表了许多人。
    为社会主义服务的艺术，只就人物形象而论，也必须是万紫千红的。如果大家都只选择同一侧面，即令它是最重要的，画来画去都是它，画法又差不多，观众也难免感到腻，很难唤起新的想像。怎样才能够塑造出既有特殊性又是有普遍性的这一个呢？或者说，怎样才能够从复杂的生活现象里，找出最有代表意义的也就是所谓最有概括性的姿态、言语和表情呢？没有别的办法，只能是见得多，看得透。现实的复杂性，群众需要的多样性，给有才能而且努力的艺术家，提供了大胆独创的前提。要从普通的现象的反映里，揭示出重大的意义，需要有较高的技巧，出众的眼光。可是有些把题材当作主题来对待的艺术家，以为写生习作可以代替典型化的艺术家，还没有向生活进行探索，就匆匆放下他的扩大镜，结束了他的劳动。不着重反映人物的性格，特别是人物的个性，只在一般的现象上用笔墨，以建筑为题材就只画施工的场面，以炼钢为题材就只画出钢的场面，好比以积肥为题材就着重描写积肥那样，不见得作者不知道别出心裁地塑造人物的重要，困难在于自己心中无数。因为心中无数，只有在一些不便于塑造典型的，形象容易流于一般化的现象上卖力，甚至重复别人既成的创造。
    怎样从现实的各个方面来进行反映，创造富于个性的典型人物，传统戏剧中有不少可供画家参考的范例。那怕是为了体现同一观念，例如为了嘲笑缺乏韧性的生活态度，同是以朱买臣的妻崔氏想和丈夫恢复关系为题材的，京剧“马前泼水”和湖北巴陵戏“夜梦冠戴”，是完全不同的生活侧面。前者着重表现的是崔氏要求做了官的朱买臣收留她，在大街上受了羞辱。后者是描写崔氏做梦，梦见她过去看不起的丈夫朱买臣，派人来迎接她；剧作者从人的下意识活动的描绘着手，对有些人的品质和思想，进行了含蓄而又尖锐的批判。就崔氏的生活而论，这两个戏都是冲突的余波，可是它也很能揭露人物的性格，便于体现特定的主题。由此可见，艺术的创造有很自由的天地。人民所喜爱的性格，例如智慧，在传统戏曲里也得到了千变万化的表现。就这一优点的表现来说，诸葛亮自己出头的“草船借箭”和“空城计”很好，不直接出头的“黄鹤楼”也不坏。
    一以当十是相对的。这一个可以代表其他，却不是代替其他。为了赞美妇女的争自由，不只描写采取武装斗争的白素贞才是最动人最有意义的。和父亲闹翻了脸的王宝钏，在爱人的坟上碰死了的祝英台，在战斗中选择爱人的穆桂英，在梦里看见爱人的杜丽娘，具体状况的区别很大，但都是很动人很有意义的形象。在戏曲里，有许多受损害而起来斗争的妇女，有一个大家共通的特点——不妥协。她们的性格，她们受害的具体情况，千差万别，斗争的对象和斗争的方式也千差万别。杜十娘用李甲最关心的东西（财富）来羞辱李甲；秦香莲还击陈世美时借助于有利于斗争的社会力量；“三上轿”里的焦氏，忍着一时的屈辱，怀了短刀去同仇人拜堂；焦桂英活着的时候没有得到胜利，变成鬼也要继续斗争。
    没有特殊也就没有一般；受封建势力蹂躏的李慧娘，她的个性和处境都不像喜儿和小飞娥，不像祝英台和白素贞，不像所有的要求自由的妇女的典型，不是“红梅阁”的缺点而是它的优点。正因为李慧娘与众不同，才不至于被其他艺术品里的妇女典型所代替。李慧娘不像小飞娥一样本来就有爱人，不像喜儿一样本来就有爱人，在游西湖时看见了陌生的然而使她倾慕的少年裴生，透露出要求改变现状的（那怕是连她自己也还不明白是什么意义的）愿望，无损于作品反封建的意义。不能说贾似道要像黄世仁那样强占别人的未婚妻才是罪恶，依靠合法地位妨碍了人们的自由就不是罪恶。更不能说李慧娘本来有爱人才应当反击仇人，本来没有爱人就该当挨贾似道的杀害。不论事情发生的早晚，也不论当事人的认识是不是明白，李慧娘不安于自由被妨碍的处境，渴望获得真正的爱情，其性质是不以具体情况的复杂性为转移的。也正如姚安杀绿娥萧方杀翠娘，杀妻的动机不尽相同，但就蔑视妇女的人格这一点而论，没有根本上的区别。如果强求李慧娘这一个妇女向别的妇女看齐，只要一般性而不要特殊，那么，不能用别的话来解释，只能说是生活的简单化，艺术内容的一般化。不是扩大艺术取材的领域，而是缩小了它的领域。
    为了适应艺术欣赏者多方面的要求，反映现实只有从多方面着眼。艺术所要求的典型化，不是现实生活的简单化。着重描写人物的行动可能塑造典型，不写人物行动，只借助于它的影响的描写，也可能塑造典型。在次要人物身上着力，不见得就是企图避开生活的重点，不是为了着重表现主要人物。个性的某一方面被强调，例如“思凡”里的小尼，在表演上着重她不安于不幸的现状和着重她幻想幸福的未来，都可以是有力的反封建的形象，都可能是完整的形象。但愿艺术领域中，不是减少而是增加富于代表性而且是富于独创性的形象。
