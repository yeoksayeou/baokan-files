Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th. Comrade Wang Jiaxiang, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation invited to attend the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech to the Congress today. The full text is as follows:

    The Chinese Communist Party delegation, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has come to participate in the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain and is very pleased to gather with the representatives of the advanced troops of the British working class. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, we extend warm brotherly congratulations to your Party Congress.

    The history of the British working class's struggle proves that the Communist Party of Great Britain, as a Marxist-Leninist party, is the only party that inherits the excellent traditions of the British working class. It has always unswervingly fought to safeguard the vital interests of the British working people, to defend the democratic rights of the working people, and to strive for the realization of socialism. It has persistently opposed the imperialist policies of war and aggression, and has carried out arduous work to defend world peace, strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and support the liberation movements of oppressed nations. In order to realize the great cause of socialism, the Communist Party of Great Britain has also waged complex and tenacious battles against the reformist ideas that corrode the working class. Especially in the last two years, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrades Pollitt and Gollan, the Communist Party of Great Britain has repelled the revisionist elements' frantic attack on the Party and achieved a major victory in defending Marxism-Leninism and consolidating the Party's unity. The Chinese Communists are pleased with all the achievements you have made.

    Your Party's Congress, holding high the bright banner of defending world peace, supporting national independence movements, and fighting for the realization of socialism, fully reflects the will and aspirations of the British working class. We believe that through mass struggles, through the struggle against reformism, through the united action of the working class and the unity of all progressive and democratic forces, through the consolidation and expansion of the Communist Party's ranks and its close ties with the working masses, you will eventually accomplish your great historical mission.

    Our era is a truly great era of the people. The strength of the world's people against imperialism exceeds the strength of imperialism. This international balance of power is greatly conducive to the cause of the people of all countries in defending peace, striving for national independence, and realizing social progress. Now, the imperialist camp's policy of arms expansion and war preparation, led by the United States, is increasingly opposed by the people of all countries in the world. The people of the world have sufficient strength and means to smash the imperialist war plans. Under the impact of the rising national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the imperialist colonial system is collapsing rapidly. The deepening of the general crisis of capitalism and the sharpening of the struggle for capitalist markets are leading to the intensification of contradictions within the imperialist camp and are arousing strong resistance from the working class to strengthen its attack on the monopoly bourgeoisie. The imperialist camp is rotting away day by day.

    Conversely, the socialist camp is thriving. The magnificent seven-year plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held not long ago, unfolded the brilliant prospect of comprehensively building a communist society before the people of the world and greatly inspired the determination of the people of the world to struggle. Other socialist countries are also developing rapidly. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, our Chinese people are also striving to build a socialist society. In the past year, with the improvement of the Chinese people's socialist and communist consciousness, there has been a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and a great development of people's communes in China. In 1958, the output value of the national economy increased by about 70% compared with 1957. This year, the Chinese people are striving to reach 18 million tons of steel production and 525 million tons of grain production. The establishment of people's communes is promoting a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production with new strength. The Chinese people have full confidence and are prepared to build China into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen, twenty, or more years.

    The development trend of the two camps increasingly clearly proves the unparalleled superiority of the vibrant socialist system over the decadent capitalist system. This development trend is increasingly conducive to the people of all countries uniting closely and struggling for world peace, national independence, and social progress. The imperialists' attempt to stop this struggle of the people of the world will never succeed, and the Yugoslav revisionists who serve US imperialism's delusions to undermine the unity of the people of the world and the communist parties of all countries in this struggle, is also wishful thinking. Communists of all countries will continue to advance victoriously under the illumination of the great Moscow Declaration.

    Comrades, the British people's struggle for peace, democracy and socialism is warmly supported by our people; just as our people have been supported by the British people in the long struggle for independence and the realization of socialism. During our Great Revolution of 1925-27, the British workers launched a movement against interfering in the Chinese revolution. This event is still fresh in the memory of the Chinese people. In our subsequent revolutionary periods and the period of building socialism, we have also received the support of the British people. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the British working class and working people for their support for our revolution and construction. We are deeply convinced that the friendship between the Chinese and British people will develop more and more with the passage of time.

    Now allow me to read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to your Party Congress:
    To the Twenty-Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Dear Comrade Delegates:

    On behalf of the entire Chinese people and all members of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm brotherly congratulations to the Twenty-Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain!

    Since its birth, the Communist Party of Great Britain has always consistently struggled to safeguard the interests of the British working class and working people, to defend democratic rights, and to strive for social progress. In recent years, the Communist Party of Great Britain has also launched active campaigns against Britain's following of the United States' policies of war and aggression, against colonialism, supporting national independence movements, and striving for peace and security in Europe and the world. The long history of struggle proves that the Communist Party of Great Britain is the advanced force of the British working class and the most faithful representative and defender of the interests of the British working people.

    At present, although the Communist Party of Great Britain still has various difficulties temporarily, and reformism still maintains a strong influence on the British labor movement, all this will change. With the development of the capitalist economic crisis and the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system, the soil on which bourgeois reformism thrives has become increasingly barren, and the conditions for promoting the awakening and unity of the British working class and the working masses are becoming increasingly mature. The convening of the Twenty-Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain will surely become a new starting point for the British working class and the working masses to struggle to achieve their democratic rights and the goals of social progress.

    We wish the Twenty-Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain complete success! We wish the ranks of the Communist Party of Great Britain to be increasingly consolidated and strengthened! We wish the Communist Party of Great Britain to achieve new successes in the cause of uniting all working people and all progressive and democratic forces in the cause of striving for peace, democracy, and social progress!
                  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                              March 25, 1959

    争取实现民主和社会进步斗争的新起点
    中共中央向英共代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺
    滋长改良主义的土壤已经越来越贫瘠了
    促进劳动人民团结一致的条件日益成熟
    新华社伦敦28日电　应邀出席英国共产党第二十六次代表大会的中国共产党代表团团长王稼祥同志今天向大会致词，全文如下：
    中国共产党代表团受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，前来参加英国共产党第二十六次代表大会，能够同英国工人阶级先进部队的代表们会聚一堂，感到非常高兴。我们谨代表中国人民和中国共产党向你们的党的代表大会，致以兄弟般的热烈祝贺。
    英国工人阶级的斗争历史证明，英国共产党作为马克思列宁主义的政党，是唯一继承英国工人阶级优秀传统的政党。它始终不渝地为维护英国劳动人民的切身利益、保卫劳动人民的民主权利和争取社会主义的实现，进行了长期的斗争。它坚持不懈地反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，为保卫世界和平、争取不同社会制度国家的和平共处和支持被压迫民族的解放运动，进行了艰巨的工作。为了实现社会主义的伟大事业，英国共产党还同腐蚀工人阶级的改良主义思想进行了复杂的坚韧的战斗。尤其在最近两年期间，英国共产党在以波立特同志和高兰同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，打退了修正主义分子对党的疯狂进攻，取得了保卫马克思列宁主义、巩固党的队伍的团结的重大胜利。中国共产党人为你们所取得的这一切成就而感到高兴。
    你们党的这次代表大会，高举着保卫世界和平、支持民族独立运动和为实现社会主义而斗争的鲜明旗帜，充分地反映了英国工人阶级的意志和愿望。我们相信，通过群众斗争，通过反对改良主义的斗争，通过工人阶级的统一行动和一切进步民主力量的团结，通过共产党队伍的巩固和扩大以及它同劳动群众的密切联系等等，你们终将完成你们的伟大的历史使命。
    我们这个时代是一个真正伟大的人民的时代，世界人民反对帝国主义的力量超过了帝国主义的力量。这种国际斗争的力量对比，大大有利于各国人民保卫和平、争取民族独立和实现社会进步的事业。现在，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的扩军备战政策，已经越来越受到世界各国人民的反对，世界人民已拥有足够的力量和手段来粉碎帝国主义的战争计划。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族解放运动的冲击之下，帝国主义的殖民体系正在日益激剧地土崩瓦解。资本主义总危机的加深和争夺资本主义市场的斗争的尖锐化，正在导致帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的激烈化，并且激起工人阶级加强对垄断资产阶级进攻的强烈抵抗。帝国主义阵营正在一天天烂下去。
    与此相反，社会主义阵营正在蒸蒸日上。不久以前举行的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的宏伟的七年计划，在全世界人民面前展开了全面建设共产主义社会的辉煌前景，大大地鼓舞了全世界人民的斗争决心。其他社会主义国家也正在一日千里地向前发展。我们中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，也正在为建成社会主义社会而奋勇前进。最近一年，随着中国人民社会主义和共产主义觉悟的提高，在中国出现了工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社的大发展。1958年，国民经济产值比1957年增长70％左右。今年，中国人民正在为争取达到钢产量一千八百万吨、粮食产量五万二千五百万吨而奋斗。人民公社的建立正在以新的力量推动着工农业生产的更大跃进。中国人民具有充分的信心，准备在十五年、二十年或者更多一些时间内把中国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
    两个阵营的发展趋势越来越显明地证明了生气勃勃的社会主义制度对于腐朽透顶的资本主义制度具有无比的优越性。这种发展趋势越来越有利于各国人民紧密地团结起来，为世界和平、民族独立和社会进步而进行斗争。帝国主义者妄图阻止世界人民的这种斗争，是永远不能得逞的，为美帝国主义效劳的南斯拉夫修正主义妄想破坏世界人民、各国共产党在这种斗争中的团结，也是枉费心机的。各国共产党人将在伟大的莫斯科宣言的照耀下，继续胜利前进。
    同志们，英国人民为争取和平、民主和社会主义事业而进行的斗争受到我国人民的热烈支持；正像我国人民在争取独立和实现社会主义的长期斗争中，曾经得到英国人民的支持一样。在我国1925—27年大革命时期，英国工人曾经发动一个反对干涉中国革命的运动，这件事在中国人民的心目中还记忆犹新。在我国以后的各个革命时期和建设社会主义时期，也得到了英国人民的支持。我愿利用这个机会，对英国工人阶级和劳动人民对于我国革命和建设事业所给予的支持表示感谢。我们深信，中英两国人民的友谊将随着时间的前进而愈益发展。
    现在请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致你们的党的代表大会的贺电：英国共产党第二十六次代表大会，亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体中国人民和全体中国共产党党员，向英国共产党第二十六次代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺！
    英国共产党从其诞生以来就始终一贯地为维护英国工人阶级和劳动人民的利益、保卫民主权利和争取社会进步而斗争。最近几年，英国共产党又展开了积极活动反对英国追随美国的战争政策和侵略政策，反对殖民主义，支持民族独立运动，争取欧洲和全世界的和平和安全。长期的斗争历史证明，英国共产党是英国工人阶级的先进部队，是英国劳动人民利益的最忠实的代表者和捍卫者。
    目前，英国共产党虽然暂时还有各种困难，改良主义还保持着对于英国工人运动的强大影响，但是，这一切都会发生变化。随着资本主义经济危机的发展和帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解，资产阶级改良主义赖以滋长的土壤已经越来越贫瘠了，促进英国工人阶级和劳动群众的觉悟和团结一致的条件正在日益成熟起来。英国共产党第二十六次代表大会的召开，必将成为英国工人阶级和劳动群众为争取实现自己的民主权利和社会进步的目标而斗争的新的起点。
    祝英国共产党第二十六次代表大会完满成功！祝英国共产党队伍日益巩固和增强！祝英国共产党在团结全体劳动人民和一切进步民主力量争取和平、民主和社会进步的事业上获得新的成就！
                  中国共产党中央委员会
                              1959年3月25日
