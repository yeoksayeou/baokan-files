(Reported from Hangzhou, this newspaper, March 19) Zhejiang Province is widely promoting a campaign to cultivate strong seedlings and prevent seedling rot in the comprehensive sowing of early rice, laying the foundation for launching a large-scale high-yield early rice campaign.

Zhejiang Province plans to plant over 15 million mu of early rice this year, and sowing is now in full swing from south to north. The entire province is meticulously carrying out the cultivation management work of leveling paddy fields, applying sufficient base fertilizer, carefully selecting good seeds, and preventing frost and rot, with each link tightly connected. Many communes have also strictly implemented the paddy field inspection and acceptance system, conducting assessments and inspections field by field before sowing, and checking while sowing. Before sowing, various localities universally carried out grain selection of good seeds, seed dressing, and seed soaking. In many communes in the Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo areas, seeds have to pass five checkpoints before being put into the mud: wind selection, screening, mud or salt water selection, baking soda soaking, and drug mixing.

The quality and quantity of base fertilizer in paddy fields this year are also better and more abundant than last year. In order to adopt advanced technology and improve sowing quality, the province has trained more than 400,000 skilled sowing and seedling cultivation personnel.

Based on the experience of early sowing and high yield last year, Zhejiang Province has advanced the sowing of early rice by ten days to half a month this year. In early March, various localities seized the sunny days with rising temperatures and rushed to sow early rice. The seedling needles in many early-sown cadre experimental fields are now one to two inches high. In order to prevent early sowing and seedling rot, the leading departments at all levels have taken some measures to protect and strengthen the seedlings. Various districts, counties, and many communes have launched cadres and commune members to discuss how to prevent seedling rot, and have also criticized some conservative ideas of not daring to sow early.

Under the slogans of "Guarantee no seedling rot, determined to cultivate good seedlings" and "Practical hard work plus skillful work, guarantee no rotten seedlings," commune members in various places are trying every means to prevent seedling rot. They have universally adopted methods such as applying sufficient ash fertilizer, building sheds in paddy fields, and weaving a large number of straw curtains and straw fans or covering paddy fields with oiled paper to prevent frost and freeze. Many communes have ensured that every paddy field has frost prevention equipment.

At present, the production teams of most communes throughout the province have organized specialized paddy field management teams and established a paddy field management responsibility system. After the establishment of the "five-fixed" responsibility system of "fixed person, fixed field, fixed quality, fixed measures, fixed rewards and punishments" in the communes of the Jiaxing area, paddy field management has achieved "every team has a commander, every level has a general, every field has a soldier, and everyone is responsible." At present, more than 400,000 cadres and commune members in the entire area have become "seedling nannies," and they are camping in the fields to strengthen nursing. The sowing and seedling cultivation professional team of more than 50,000 people in Tongxiang County promptly grasped the changes in weather and took turns on duty to take care of the seedlings, so the seedlings grew strong. The production teams of the communes in Wenzhou, Jinhua, Ningbo and other regions have also universally strengthened the management of paddy fields, adopted various insulation and anti-freeze measures to prevent seedling rot, and the paddy field management professional teams of many production teams have carried out seedling competition to cultivate strong seedlings and prevent seedling rot between teams and people.

(Reported from Wuhan, this newspaper, March 19) About 50% of the paddy fields in Hubei Province have been leveled like mirrors and the mud is as rotten as soup. The 500,000 mu of early rice paddy fields in the Huanggang area have generally been cultivated twice, and many fields have been cultivated three or four times, earlier and better than last year. The province's plan for base fertilizer for early rice has been completed more than 70%, generally more than double last year. Because this year's water conservancy projects have played a greater role, most areas have now accumulated enough water for seedling cultivation, transplanting, and early irrigation of rice fields. At present, the seedlings in some early rice experimental fields have already revealed tender buds.

Hubei Province plans to sow 12 million mu of early rice this year, more than double last year, and the autumn fields will also be more than double last year. The province has universally promoted moist paddy fields to prevent seedling rot. Xiaogan and Xishui counties require moist paddy fields to be normalized. According to last year's experience, this kind of paddy field has the advantages of fast rooting, no seedling lodging, less seedling rot, and fewer weeds and pests. The counties in the Jianghan Plain and the eastern Hubei rice area have also trained thousands of rice seedling cultivation technicians. Huangpi County alone will train about 100,000 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 19th. Early rice in most areas of Hunan has been soaked, and 80% of the seeds in the Chenxian area, where the season is earlier, have been planted, and some seedlings have grown into a tender green.

This year, according to the new situation that rice fields in Hunan are generally ploughed more than twice as deep as last year and fertilizers are greatly increased, various localities have universally selected folk varieties of early japonica "Sixteen," Mafengnian, Daguanzhan, Tonghe, Yunpabai, etc., which have developed root systems, absorb more fertilizer, and have large ears and many grains, for sowing and seedling cultivation. In the past, due to shallow ploughing and little fertilization, the advantages of these varieties were not brought into play, so they were not valued by farmers. Last year, many deeply ploughed and heavily fertilized rice fields adopted these varieties and generally achieved high yields, so this year farmers throughout the province are willing to use them for seedling cultivation.

Absorbing the experience of last year's bumper harvest of crops, various localities will promote reasonable close planting this year. The amount of sowing per mu of paddy field is generally prepared to be increased to 20 to 25 catties.

Cultivating strong seedlings is the first hurdle to ensure a good rice harvest. To this end, the province has universally promoted moist paddy fields and selected more than 2 million mu of good fields with wind protection, sun exposure, and convenient drainage and irrigation as paddy fields. According to the situation in some places last year where seed soaking and seedling cultivation were divided into two teams, resulting in unclear responsibilities and affecting the quality of seedlings, people's communes in various places have universally organized specialized seed soaking and seedling cultivation teams and established a production responsibility system, laying the foundation for cultivating strong seedlings. Since the 11th, the Chenxian area, which was sown earlier, has been attacked by cold waves for several consecutive days. The entire area dispatched more than 440,000 people to protect seedlings. They built more than 30,000 windbreak sheds along the paddy fields, burned more than 60,000 fires in the fields to increase the temperature of the paddy fields, and also applied 2.34 million dan of plant ash to more than 100,000 mu of paddy fields to keep them warm. The fields were filled with flames and people, and finally the cold wave was overcome and the tender seedlings were protected.

(Reported from Hefei, this newspaper, March 19) The southern Anhui area of ​​Anhui is cultivating early rice strong seedlings to welcome the transplanting season. In order to solve the contradiction between early sowing of early rice and climate, various localities have vigorously promoted the rapid seedling cultivation method. Since mid-February, Guangde, Langxi, Dangtu, Xuancheng, Qimen and other places have successively soaked seeds and cultivated seedlings. Xuancheng Shuangqiao People's Commune soaked rice seeds with stronger cold resistance such as "503", "Atomic No. 2", "Awned Early Japonica", and "Unawned Early Japonica", put them in linen bags and rice baskets, first put them in warm water at 45 to 47 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes, then put them in warm water at 55 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, and then immediately took them out and put them in cold water to cool down. In this way, the rice seeds germinated within 40 to 48 hours.

In order to pass the hurdle of strong winds and frosts, people's communes in various places have also woven a large number of straw curtains. According to statistics from eleven counties including Guangde and Xiuning, more than 813,000 straw curtains have now been made, and Dangtu and Guangde counties have made windbreaks for more than 16,000 mu of paddy fields. At the same time, the entire area organized more than 15,400 paddy field management teams (with a total of more than 114,000 people participating) to carefully manage the paddy fields. The paddy fields for seedling cultivation have been carefully sorted out and generally ploughed from one to three times and sufficient base fertilizer has been applied. Now the seedlings are growing vigorously and are bright green.

    像抚育婴儿般管理秧田
    浙江、湖北、湖南、皖南农民精心培育壮秧
    本报杭州19日电　浙江省各地在全面播种早稻中，广泛开展育壮秧、不烂秧运动，为开展早稻大面积高产运动打下基础。
    浙江省今年规划种植的一千五百多万亩早稻，目前正由南而北的全面开始播种。全省平整秧田、施足基肥、精选良种、防冻防烂等培育管理工作都精益求精，一环扣一环。许多公社还严格执行了秧田检查验收制度，做到逐丘鉴定，播前检查，边播边查。在播种前，各地普遍进行粒选良种，拌种浸种。温州、金华、宁波等专区许多公社在种子落泥前要过五关，即风选、筛选、泥水或盐水选、小苏打浸种和药物拌种。
    今年秧田基肥也比去年质好量多。为了采用先进技术和提高播种质量，全省已经训练播种育秧能手四十多万人。
    浙江省各地根据去年早播丰产的经验，今年早稻播种比去年提早十天到半月。3月上旬，各地抓住气温升高的晴天，抢播早稻。许多早播的干部试验田现在秧针长高一二寸。为了防止早播烂秧，各级领导部门采取了一些措施来保育壮秧，各专区、县和许多公社发动干部和社员讨论如何防止烂秧的办法，对一些不敢早播的保守思想也进行了批判。
    各地社员在“保证不烂秧，决心育好秧”、“实干苦干加巧干、保证不烂一株秧”等口号下，千方百计防止烂秧，普遍采用了施足灰肥、秧田搭棚和编织大量草帘草扇或用油纸复盖秧田等办法，防冻防霜，许多公社做到块块秧田有防冻设备。
    目前，全省各公社的生产队大多组织了秧田管理专业队，建立了秧田管理责任制度。嘉兴专区各公社以生产队为单位普遍建立了定人、定田、定质量、定措施、定奖惩制度的“五定”责任制后，做到了秧田管理“队队有帅、层层有将、丘丘有兵、人人有责”。目前全专区有四十多万干部和社员当了“秧保姆”，他们扎营田间，加强护理。桐乡县五万多人组成的播种育秧专业队，及时掌握天气变化，轮流值班护理，因而秧苗长的茁壮。温州、金华、宁波等专区各公社的生产队也普遍加强秧田管理工作，采取各种保温防冻办法防止烂秧，许多生产队的秧田管理专业队开展了队与队、人与人之间的育壮苗、不烂秧竞赛。（伊心恬）
    本报武汉19日电　湖北全省50％左右的秧田已平整如镜、泥烂如羹。黄冈专区五十万亩早稻秧田，一般都耕整了两遍，有不少田耕整了三、四遍，比去年耕得早、整得好。全省早稻底肥的积肥计划已完成70％以上，一般都比去年增加一倍多。由于今年各地水利工程发挥了更大的作用，大部分地区现在已经蓄积了足够培苗、插秧和稻田前期灌溉用水。目前，有些早稻的试验田的秧苗已露出嫩芽。
  湖北省今年计划播种早稻一千二百万亩，比去年扩大一倍多，秋田也比去年要扩大一倍以上。全省普遍推广了湿润秧田，防止烂秧。孝感和浠水等县要求湿润秧田化。根据去年经验，这种秧田具有扎根快，不倒苗，烂秧少，杂草虫害少等优点。江汉平原和鄂东稻区各县还都培养了成千上万的水稻育秧技术员，仅黄陂县将培养十万人左右。

    新华社长沙19日电　湖南大部地区的早稻已经浸种，季节较早的郴县专区已有80％的种谷下田，有些秧苗已经生长得一片嫩绿。
    今年湖南各地根据稻田一般比去年深耕一倍以上、肥料大大增加的新情况，普遍选用根系发达、吸肥多、穗大粒多产量高的早粳“十六”号、麻风粘、大光粘、桐禾、云怕白等民间良种播种育秧。过去由于耕的浅施肥少，这些品种的优点没有发挥出来，因而也没受到农民的重视。去年，许多深耕肥多的稻田采用这些品种，普遍获得高额丰产，因此今年全省农民，都乐意用它们来育秧。
    吸收去年农作物丰产的经验，今年各地都将推行合理密植。每亩秧田的播种量一般都准备增加到二十斤到二十五斤。
    培育壮秧，是保证水稻丰收的第一关。为此，全省各地普遍推行了湿润秧田，并选择了避风向阳、排灌方便的好田二百多万亩做秧田。各地人民公社根据去年有些地方浸种、育秧分成两套人马，结果责任不明，影响秧苗质量的情况，今年普遍组织了浸种育秧专业队，建立生产责任制，为培育壮秧打下了基础。播种较早的郴县专区从11日以来，连日遭到寒潮的袭击，全区出动四十四万多人护秧保苗。他们在秧田边搭起了三万多个挡风棚，在田里烧火六万多处，增加秧田温度，还在十多万亩秧田里追施二百三十四万多担草木灰，保温保苗。田野里火光冲天，人声鼎沸，终于战胜了寒潮，保住了嫩秧。
    本报合肥19日电　安徽皖南地区正在培育早稻壮秧，迎接栽插季节的来临。为了解决早稻早播与气候的矛盾，各地大力推行了快速育秧法。从2月中旬开始，广德、郎溪、当涂、宣城、祁门等地，先后泡种育秧。宣城双桥人民公社，披抗寒力较强的“五零三”、“原子二号”、“有芒早粳”、“无芒早粳”等稻种泡好后，装入麻袋和稻箩里，先放在摄氏四十五度至四十七度的温水里浸五分钟，再放入摄氏五十五度的温水浸十分钟，然后立即拿出放在凉水里冷却，这样，在四十至四十八小时内，稻种就出芽了。
    为了过好大风霜冻这一关，各地人民公社还编制了大量草帘子。据广德、休宁等十一个县的统计，现在已打好草帘八十一万三千多张，当涂、广德两县为一万六千多亩秧田做好了防风障。同时，全专区又组织了一万五千四百多个秧田管理小组（共有十一万四千多人参加），精心管理秧田。育秧的秧田都经过精心整理，并普遍翻犁了一交到三交，施了足够的基肥。现在秧苗生长旺盛，一片鲜绿。
