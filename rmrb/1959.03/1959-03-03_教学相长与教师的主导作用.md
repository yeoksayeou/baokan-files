Teaching and learning are generally the relationship between teachers and students. Teacher and student, teaching and learning, are the two aspects of a contradictory unity. The main task of teachers is teaching, but they must also learn, including learning from students. The main task of students is learning, but they can also teach, including educating teachers. The so-called teaching and learning go hand in hand reflects the objective dialectic of this teaching relationship between teachers and students.

Teaching and learning go hand in hand, but under the old education system, its role could not be fully realized due to the limitations of social conditions. For example, in the scholar-official class of feudal society, there was a trend of being ashamed to "take someone as a teacher" and ashamed to "ask questions to one's inferiors"; it was naturally difficult for teachers and students to teach and learn from each other and for teaching and learning to go hand in hand. Under the capitalist system, knowledge is a commodity, and the relationship between teachers and students is actually a transaction of knowledge and money; those who have knowledge are never willing to easily teach others; it is, of course, difficult for teaching and learning to go hand in hand.

Under the socialist system, the situation is fundamentally different. The relationship between teachers and students here is a comrade-like relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation based on democracy and equality. Teachers cannot rely on feudal-style rule to maintain their dignity, but must set an example for students with their "both red and expert" qualities; they should not engage in teaching solely for "tuition," but should devote themselves to education to cultivate the next generation that is "both red and expert." Students respect teachers for their "both red and expert" qualities, for their hard work in "tirelessly teaching," for being a bridge for inheriting human scientific culture, and for being a guide for developing human scientific culture, and no longer worship teachers as idols. Teachers love students for their promising future, for being a symbol of the times, for their "never being tired of learning" spirit of advancement, for being successors to inheriting human scientific culture, and for being a vital force in developing and creating human scientific culture, and cannot regard students as personal protégés and use them as "assistants" for personal gain. In this way, teachers and students can be in a mutually equal position in the face of science and truth; teaching and learning go hand in hand also has a broad place to fully play its role.

The teaching and learning between teachers and students usually follows this development process: students' knowledge is first acquired from teachers; some is also acquired through their own direct practice. Students learn knowledge from teachers, and after independent thinking, integrate it to become their own knowledge; students who are good at learning can also draw inferences about other cases from one instance and learn analogous things, achieving "understanding two things from hearing one," or even "understanding ten things from hearing one." This is "the student surpasses the teacher." When students surpass teachers, they can, in turn, educate teachers. Even if they have not surpassed teachers, they may, after a period of learning and improved level, make new and higher learning demands on teachers; this will objectively promote the improvement of teachers. When teachers improve, they can, in turn, educate students at a higher level. Like this, "as the water rises, the boat floats higher," and the cycle continues, forming a picture of teaching and learning going hand in hand between teachers and students.

In the rectification movement and teaching reform, the teaching and learning between teachers and students has created new forms and enriched new content; that is, students can openly criticize teachers, and teachers and students can carry out "a hundred schools of thought contend." It is often the case that after students have learned certain knowledge from teachers, they do not agree with some of the teachers' views. Because they have broken superstitions and liberated their minds, they use the weapon of Marxism-Leninism to boldly identify, comment on, and criticize these knowledge materials and views in order to extract their essence and discard their dross; or they put forward their own different opinions and viewpoints from those of the teachers on certain issues, forming a situation of "contention." Once there is "contention," the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, errors are mutually negated, teachers and students receive common improvement, culture and science are rapidly developed, and a new teaching atmosphere is formed. In this way, teaching and learning go hand in hand is raised to a new level.

Advocating teaching and learning go hand in hand does not mean belittling the role of teachers in teaching. On the contrary, it is necessary to respect the leading position of teachers in teaching and to give full play to the leading role of teachers in teaching. Without teaching and learning going hand in hand, the so-called leading role of teachers is obviously false; but without giving play to the leading role of teachers, the so-called teaching and learning going hand in hand will also fall through. Teacher, as the name implies, his main responsibility is to "teach." Han Yu said it well: "A teacher is one who imparts the Way, imparts skills, and resolves doubts." Although the content of the so-called "Way, skills, and doubts" will vary with the times, will vary with the class attributes of education, and will vary with the subject of teaching, the main responsibilities of "imparting, teaching, and resolving" belong to the teacher, which is undoubtedly true. Because generally speaking, the "Way" and "skills" are mainly mastered by teachers, and teachers always hear the "Way" first and have specialized "skills" earlier than students. This objectively forms the leading position of teachers in teaching. What about students? As the name implies, their main task is to "learn." Young students are in a period of growing knowledge, as Lenin taught: the task of youth "can be expressed in one sentence, that is, to learn." China also has the ancient saying "learn young, act strong"; without putting in the painstaking effort of "cutting, filing, carving, and polishing," one will be "jade that is not carved, which cannot become a useful object." They have a strong desire for knowledge, a strong desire to make progress, and are full of creative spirit; but their knowledge is not much after all, and they need to go through a process from not knowing to knowing, from knowing little to knowing more, that is, they need to go through a learning process. Schools are places for "cultivating people," places for young people to learn culture, learn knowledge, learn skills, and learn how to be people; their main purpose in entering school is to "seek knowledge." This word "seek" objectively reflects the subordinate position of students in teaching.

For teachers, what does it mean to recognize their leading position in teaching? That is to take practical responsibility for teaching work. The people entrust their next generation to schools for education, and as one of the main members of the school and a teacher who plays a leading role in teaching, they must shoulder the sacred responsibility for the growth of the next generation. A sculptor who carves jade into something that is neither bird nor beast, a gardener who causes flowers to be infested with poisonous insects, will be blamed for "dereliction of duty"; what about teachers? Educating students into something that is neither red nor expert is also a "dereliction of duty."

At present, the sense of responsibility of many teachers in our schools is admirable. Some teachers, together with their students, climb mountains and wade through rivers to guide students in carrying out "real" graduation designs; some teachers, day and night, forget to eat and sleep to guide students in establishing internship factories. Such situations were common during the Great Leap Forward. However, there are also a few teachers who are either unwilling to take responsibility, or dare not take responsibility, or lack an active and responsible spirit, which will affect the teaching and learning going hand in hand and affect the play of the leading role of teachers. A teacher who has the ideological foundation of loving students and has a practical sense of responsibility for teaching work should certainly praise the gratifying phenomenon of students surpassing themselves and "rising from behind"; even for some inappropriate parts of students' criticism of themselves, they should also have the demeanor of an educator, assist and guide them, patiently guide them, and teach them tirelessly.

For students, what does it mean to respect the leading role of teachers in teaching? That is to give full play to the strengths of teachers and earnestly learn the useful knowledge of teachers; at the same time, they can supplement the shortcomings of teachers with their active participation in improving teaching. It is a great thing for students to dare to criticize teachers, and it is not possible to cancel this criticism; but the criticism must improve quality and strive to be appropriate, which will be more conducive to unity and progress.

At no time should we forget that our advocacy of the leading role of teachers is a leading role under the leadership of the Party, implementing the Party's education policy, and implementing the Party's mass line. The Party's policy is to "cultivate students into laborers who have socialist consciousness and culture," that is, to enable students to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical education. Under the guidance of this policy, the task of teachers is to go all out and give play to creativity to achieve our purpose of running education. Leaving the leadership of the Party, leaving the Party's education policy, and leaving the mass line to isolate and emphasize the "leading" role will have the danger of making education divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses. Under the leadership of the Party, we have formed a new relationship between teachers and students, and we must achieve greater victories in teaching work.

### 教学相长与教师的主导作用

    教学相长与教师的主导作用
    成于思
    教师与学生的关系，一般表现为教和学的关系。师与生，教与学，是矛盾统一体的两个方面。教师的主要任务是教，同时也要学，包括向学生学习。学生的主要任务是学，同时也可以教，包括教育教师。所谓教学相长，正反映了师生间这种教学关系的客观辩证法。
    教学相长，在旧的教育制度下，由于社会条件的限制，并没有能够充分发挥它的作用。例如在封建社会的士大夫阶层中，就有一种耻于“相师”、耻于“下问”的风气；要师生间能够互教互学，教学相长，自然就困难了。在资本主义制度下，知识是商品，师生间的关系，实际上是一种知识与金钱的买卖关系；谁有知识，总不肯轻易教人；教学相长，当然也就困难了。
    在社会主义制度下，情况就根本不同了。这里的师生关系，是以民主、平等为基础的同志般的互助合作关系。教师对学生，不能依靠封建式的统治来维护自己的尊严，而要靠自己的“又红又专”在学生中树立榜样；不能专为“束修”来从事教学，而应当为培养“又红又专”的下一代致力于教育事业。学生尊师，是要尊其“又红又专”，尊其
  “诲人不倦”的辛勤劳动，尊其是继承人类科学文化的桥梁，尊其是发展人类科学文化的向导，而不再把教师当着偶像来崇拜。教师爱生，是爱其方兴未艾，爱其是时代的象征，爱其“学而不厌”的进取精神，爱其是继承人类科学文化的接班人，爱其是发展和创造人类科学文化的生力军，而不能把学生视为个人的桃李门墙，用作个人猎取名利的“助手”。这样，师生双方，就能够在科学和真理面前，处于相互平等的地位；教学相长，也才有了充分发挥其作用的广阔场所。
    师生间的教学相长，通常是这样一个发展过程：学生的知识，首先是从教师那里接受过来的；也有一部分是通过自己的直接实践取得的。学生从教师那里学来知识，经过独立思考，加以融会贯通，成为自己的知识；善于学习的学生，还能触类旁通，举一反三，做到“闻一以知二”，甚至是“闻一以知十”。这便是“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。学生胜过教师，反过来就可以教育教师。即使没有超过教师，他们也可能在经过一段学习，提高了水平之后，向教师提出新的更高的学习要求；这在客观上也会促进教师的提高。教师提高了，回头又可以在较高水平的基础上去教育学生。像这样“水涨船高”，循环不已，就构成一幅师生间教学相长的图画。
    在整风运动和教学改革中，师生间的教学相长，又创造了新的形式，充实了新的内容；这便是学生可以公开批评教师，师生间开展“百家争鸣”。常有这样的情况：学生从教师那里学到一定的知识以后，但并不同意教师的某些观点。由于破除了迷信，解放了思想，他们运用马列主义的武器，大胆地对这些知识材料和观点，加以鉴定，加以评论，加以批判，以求取其精华，扬其糟粕；或在某些问题上提出自己和教师不同的见解和观点，而形成一种“争鸣”的局面。一经“争鸣”，真理愈辩愈明，错误相互否定，师生得到共同的提高，文化科学得以迅速发展，新的教学风气因而形成。这样，教学相长，便被提到了一个新的水平。
    提倡教学相长，并不意味着要贬低教师在教学上的作用。相反，要尊重教师在教学中的主导地位，要充分发挥教师在教学上的主导作用。没有教学相长，所谓教师的主导作用显然是假的；但不发挥教师的主导作用，所谓教学相长，也会落空。教师，顾名思义，他的主要职责是“教”。韩愈说得对：“师者所以传道、授业、解惑也”。尽管所谓“道、业、惑”的内容会因时代的不同而异，会因教育的阶级属性不同而异，会因教学的科目不同而异，然而“传、授、解”的主要职责属于教师，这是无疑的。因为一般说来，
  “道”和“业”主要还是掌握在教师方面，教师比之于学生，总是闻“道”在先，攻有专“业”的。这就在客观上形成了教师在教学中的主导地位。学生呢？顾名思义，他的主要任务是“学”。青年学生，处于长知识的时期，正如列宁所教导的：青年的任务，“可以用一句话来表示，就是要学习”。中国也有“幼而学，壮而行”的古话，不下点“如切如磋，如琢如磨”的刻苦工夫，便会是“玉不琢，不成器”。他们求知欲旺，进取心强，富于创造精神；但知识毕竟不多，需要经过一个从不知到知、从知之不多到知之较多的过程，也就是要经过一个学习的过程。学校是“树人”的地方，是青年人学文化、学知识、学本领、学做人的地方，他们进入学校的主要目的是“求学”。这个“求”字，就客观地反映了学生在教学中的从属地位。
    对教师来说，认识到自己在教学中的主导地位是意味着什么呢？那就是要对教学工作切实负起责任。人民把自己的下一代委托学校进行教养，作为学校主要成员之一、并要在教学中起主导作用的教师，就必须对下一代的成长肩负起神圣的责任。一个雕刻家，把玉石雕琢得非禽非兽，一个园艺师使花卉附生了毒虫，将被责以“失职”；教师呢？把学生教育成不红不专，同样是一种“失职”行为。
    目前，我们学校中许多教师的负责精神是令人可佩的。有的教师和学生一起，爬山涉水，指导学生大搞“真刀真枪”的毕业设计；有的教师，夜以继日，废寝忘食地指导学生建立实习工厂。大跃进中这样的情况比比皆是。但也有少数教师，或者是不肯负责，或者是不敢负责，或者是缺乏积极主动负责的精神，这都会影响教学相长，影响教师主导作用的发挥。一个有了爱学生的思想基础，有了对教学工作切实负责精神的教师，对于学生超过自己的可喜现象，固然应当嘉其“后来居上”；即使对于学生批评自己的某些不恰当部分，也要有教育者的风度，辅之导之，循循善诱，诲人不倦。
    对学生来说，尊重教师在教学中的主导作用是意味着什么呢？那就要充分发挥教师的所长，认真学习教师的有用知识；同时能以自己主动参与改进教学的积极行为，以补教师的所短。学生敢于批评教师，是一件大好事，取消这种批评是不行的；但批评要提高质量，要力求恰当，这才更有利于团结和进步。
    任何时候都不应忘记：我们提倡教师的主导作用，是在党的领导之下、执行党的教育方针、贯彻党的群众路线的前提下的主导作用。党的方针，是要“培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者”，也就是要学生在德育、智育、体育几个方面都得到发展。教师的任务，是在这个方针的指导下，鼓足干劲，发挥创造性，来实现我们办教育的目的。离开了党的领导，离开了党的教育方针，离开了群众路线，而去孤立地强调“主导”作用，将有使教育脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的危险。我们在党的领导下形成了新的师生关系，我们一定要在教学工作上取得更大的胜利。
