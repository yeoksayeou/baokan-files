Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 22nd: Zhu De, head of the Chinese Communist Party and government delegation, and delegation members Xi Zhongxun and Hao Deqing, accompanied by Marosan, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, today attended a mass meeting in the Ninth District of Budapest to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. When Vice Chairman Zhu and the delegation members entered the venue, all those present stood up and applauded them for a long time.

At the celebration meeting, Horváth, Secretary of the Ninth District Party Committee of Budapest, made a report on commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

Next, Vice Chairman Zhu De spoke at the meeting. He spoke of the glorious revolutionary traditions of the working people of Budapest, the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian people in socialist construction, especially the achievements made in the years since crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956. Vice Chairman Zhu emphasized that the organizer and inspirer of Hungary's socialist construction is the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has made significant contributions in opposing modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito group, consolidating the international unity of the proletariat, and defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party expresses the will of the people and represents the interests of the people. It has won the trust and support of the broad masses with its correct policies, close ties with the people, and excellent work style. Vice Chairman Zhu said that these new achievements made by the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Communist Party after crushing the 1956 counter-revolutionary riots are a great encouragement to the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party.

Vice Chairman Zhu De continued, the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party in March 1959 proposed striving to reach the 1960 level stipulated in the Three-Year Plan by the end of 1959 in important indicators such as the production cost of socialist industrial production, labor productivity, capital construction, and national income, striving to achieve a bumper harvest on the agricultural front this year, while consolidating existing agricultural production cooperatives and welcoming a new upsurge in agricultural cooperation. The working people of Hungary have given full play to their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, setting off a vigorous and large-scale labor competition to ensure the completion of these tasks. We believe that the Hungarian people will surely be able to successfully achieve their current goals and push the socialist cause forward at a faster pace.

Vice Chairman Zhu also spoke of the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction in 1958, as well as this year's magnificent production tasks and bright prospects. When he spoke of this, warm applause rang out continuously in the venue.

Vice Chairman Zhu then spoke of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples and the current international situation. Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the current international situation is very favorable to us. The unity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union and the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been further consolidated. The socialist camp countries are becoming increasingly strong, and their economies are developing at a high speed. All the sabotage plots of the imperialists and their agents—the modern revisionists—have failed again and again, and will inevitably go completely bankrupt. The recently held 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great Seven-Year Plan it adopted mark that the day is not far off when the socialist system will achieve an overwhelming advantage over the capitalist system not only politically and militarily but also economically. In the capitalist world, the general crisis is deepening, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, the imperialist colonial system is disintegrating, and the imperialist countries are moving towards disintegration. The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Even if the imperialists may be rampant for a while in certain parts of the capitalist world, this is only a death struggle, and the result will more decisively determine their final failure and demise.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that today, as we gather together to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, I think we all have a common feeling, feeling how enormous changes have taken place in the world situation in the past 40 years, and how enormous the growth of revolutionary forces has been. Our cause is just, and the future belongs to us.

Vice Chairman Zhu's speech was warmly welcomed by the meeting and was constantly interrupted by stormy applause. Representatives of veteran Soviet revolutionaries also spoke at the meeting.

Finally, Marosan spoke at the meeting. He elaborated on the great significance of proletarian internationalism and the importance of fraternal unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people for the fraternal assistance they gave to the Hungarian people politically and economically during the 1956 Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots and after the counter-revolutionary events. Finally, Horváth, secretary of the Ninth District Party Committee, presented gifts to Vice Chairman Zhu on behalf of the Ninth District Party Committee and the workers of the bulb factory in the district.

Before the opening of the celebration meeting, Comrade Horváth warmly introduced the situation of the Ninth District of Budapest to Vice Chairman Zhu De. Vice Chairman Zhu also met with the veteran revolutionary fighters who participated in the celebration meeting and had a cordial conversation with them.

    在布达佩斯第九区群众大会上
    朱德副主席说未来是属于我们的
    指出一切帝国主义者和他们代理人的阴谋必将彻底破产
    新华社布达佩斯22日电　中国共产党和政府代表团团长朱德副主席和代表团团员习仲勋、郝德青在匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央书记处书记马罗山同志的陪同下，今天参加了布达佩斯第九区举行的庆祝匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年的群众大会。当朱副主席和代表团团员走进会场时，与会者全体起立，经久不息地鼓掌欢迎他们。
    在庆祝大会上，布达佩斯第九区区党委书记霍尔瓦特作了关于纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年的报告。
    接着，朱德副主席在会上讲了话。他谈到了布达佩斯劳动人民光荣的革命传统，谈到了匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就，特别是在粉碎了1956年10月反革命叛乱后几年来取得的成就。朱副主席强调指出，匈牙利社会主义建设事业的组织者和鼓舞者是以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党。匈牙利社会主义工人党在反对以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义、巩固无产阶级的国际团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面作出了重大贡献。匈牙利社会主义工人党表达了人民的意志，代表了人民的利益，它以正确的政策和人民群众密切的联系和优良的工作作风，赢得了广大群众的信任和支持。朱副主席说，匈牙利人民和匈牙利共产党人在粉碎1956年反革命暴乱后所取得的这些新的成就，对于中国人民和中国共产党人是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    朱德副主席接着说，社会主义工人党中央委员会1959年3月全会的决议提出要争取在1959年底在社会主义工业生产的生产成本、劳动生产率、基本建设和国民收入等重要指标上达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平，争取在农业战线上取得今年的丰收，同时巩固现有的农业生产合作社，迎接农业合作化新的高潮。匈牙利的劳动人民高度发挥革命积极性和创造性，掀起了一个蓬蓬勃勃规模巨大的劳动竞赛，来保证完成这些任务。我们相信，匈牙利人民一定能够胜利地实现当前的目标，以更快的速度把社会主义事业推向前进。
    朱副主席还谈到了中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，1958年在社会主义建设事业中取得的伟大成就以及今年的宏伟的生产任务和美好的前景。他讲到这里时，会场上不断响起热烈的掌声。
    朱副主席接着谈到中匈两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊，谈到目前的国际形势。朱德副主席说，目前国际形势对我们是十分有利的。以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营和以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结有了进一步的巩固，社会主义阵营各国正在日益强大，它们的经济正在高速度地发展。一切帝国主义者和他们的代理人——现代修正主义者的破坏阴谋一次又一次地失败了，并且必将彻底地破产。最近举行的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会和它所通过的伟大的七年计划标志着，社会主义体系不仅在政治上和军事上而且在经济上也取得对资本主义体系的压倒优势的日子不久就要到来。而在资本主义世界中总危机正在加深，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在澎湃地高涨，帝国主义的殖民主义体系正在瓦解，帝国主义国家之间正在走向四分五裂，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。帝国主义者即使可能在资本主义世界范围内的某些地方猖獗一时，但是，这只不过是垂死的挣扎，结果将更加决定他们的最后失败和灭亡。
    朱副主席说，今天当我们聚会在一起纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年的时候，我想我们大家都有一个共同的感觉，感觉到四十年来世界形势发生了多么巨大的变化，革命力量有了多么巨大的增长。我们的事业是正义的，未来是属于我们的。
    朱副主席的讲话受到大会的热烈欢迎，不断为暴风雨般的掌声所打断。在会上讲话的还有苏联老革命战士的代表。
    最后，马罗山在会上讲了话。他阐述了世界无产阶级国际主义的伟大意义和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般团结互助合作的重要性，他并且衷心感谢中国共产党、毛泽东主席和中国人民在1956年匈牙利反革命暴乱时和反革命事件后在政治上和经济上给予匈牙利人民兄弟般的帮助。最后，第九区区党委书记霍尔瓦特代表第九区区党委会和该区电灯泡工厂的职工向朱副主席献了礼品。
    在庆祝大会开幕前，霍尔瓦特同志热情地向朱德副主席介绍了布达佩斯第九区的情况。朱副主席还会见了参加庆祝会的老革命战士，并同他们进行了亲切的谈话。
