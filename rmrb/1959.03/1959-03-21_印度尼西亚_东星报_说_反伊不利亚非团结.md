Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th. The Indonesian "East Star Newspaper" published an editorial on the 18th, pointing out that the situation caused by the United Arab Republic's opposition to Iraq's activities "is detrimental to Afro-Asian solidarity, but beneficial to imperialist and colonialist groups."

The editorial said that imperialists and colonialists often use accusations against "communists" as an excuse for their aggression and intervention.

The editorial said that it is very regrettable that the authorities of the United Arab Republic also use this accusation to attack Iraq. The editorial then said that this accusation violates the spirit of the Bandung Conference and will only be detrimental to the United Arab Republic.

"East Star Newspaper" also published a conversation between the Iraqi ambassador to Indonesia, Ibrahim Fazli, and the newspaper's reporter. Fazli pointed out that Prime Minister Qasim pursues an independent and active policy; in Iraq, people can express their views and ideas in the way they like best. He said that it is for this reason that Qasim is dubbed a "communist."

    印度尼西亚“东星报”说
    反伊不利亚非团结
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”在18日发表社论指出，由于阿拉伯联合共和国反对伊拉克的活动而引起的局势“是不利于亚非的团结的，但是却有利于帝国主义和殖民主义集团”。
    社论说，帝国主义者和殖民主义者经常利用对“共产党人”的指责作为他们进行侵略和干涉的借口。
    社论说，阿拉伯联合共和国当局也利用这种指责来攻击伊拉克，这是非常令人遗憾的。社论接着说，这种指责是违反万隆会议的精神的，同时只会对阿拉伯联合共和国不利。
    “东星报”同时刊载了伊拉克驻印度尼西亚公使易卜拉欣·法兹利对这家报纸记者发表的谈话。法兹利指出，卡塞姆总理奉行独立和积极的政策；在伊拉克，人民可以用他们最欢喜的方式来表示他们自己的观点和想法。他说，正是由于这个原因，卡塞姆被冠以“共产党人”的名字。
