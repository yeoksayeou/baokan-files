On the Question of the Withering Away of the State and Other Matters

Editor's Note: Since "Study Translations" was renamed "Academic Translations" at the beginning of this year, three issues have been published. These three issues have primarily published articles by Soviet scholars clarifying and discussing some theoretical issues concerning communist construction, which are worth reading. The following are abstracts of several articles translated and published in the latest issue of "Academic Translations."

Prerequisites for the Withering Away of the State

With the complete victory of socialism, the threat of imperialist aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries will disappear. Consequently, national defense will no longer be needed, nor will it be necessary to maintain armies and the state to solve external tasks. Thus, Engels' formula regarding the withering away of the state after the victory of the socialist revolution will take effect.

The political prerequisites for the withering away of the state should be:

1.  The elimination of exploiting classes and the establishment of spiritual and political unity in society. This prerequisite has already been established in our country. In the Soviet Union, the function of suppressing the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes has disappeared. Our armies, intelligence agencies, and punitive organs are aimed at external enemies.

2.  The expansion of socialist democracy.

From the perspective of the internal conditions for the development from a socialist society to communism, expanding socialist democracy is the most important political prerequisite for the withering away of the state. A completely and thoroughly victorious communism is a society without a state. However, it should not be concluded that communist society will not have any organization to adjust people's relationships. Communism is a highly organized society that manages vast and continuously improving production, elevates the development of science, technology, and art to increasingly higher levels, ensures communist education for children and youth, guarantees the comprehensive development of all, and organizes distribution according to ability and need. It is very clear that the management work of communist society will be undertaken by certain social organizations. It is also very clear that these organizations cannot be bestowed upon communist society in ready-made form. They must be established in the process of the organic development of society along the path of communism and must gradually replace the state and state organs. In our conditions, this process simultaneously consolidates and strengthens the socialist state and prepares for the future withering away of the state. The Communist Party is the leading force in preparing for the future withering away of the state, and it plays an increasingly significant role in the construction of communist society.

3.  The complete victory of socialism and the elimination of the danger of aggression against socialist camp countries (which is the result of the victory of the socialist revolution in decisive capitalist countries) should also be listed as a political prerequisite for the withering away of the state. This victory will mean that the fundamental contradiction of our time—the contradiction between the socialist system and the capitalist system—will be resolved in favor of socialism. This will gradually cause the state to lose its political nature, and political functions will gradually become purely administrative functions.

The economic prerequisites for the withering away of the state are: the powerful development of productive forces necessary for establishing communist distribution principles, the elimination of the essential differences between manual and mental labor, and between urban and rural areas, and labor becoming the primary need of people's lives. Complete communism is necessary for the state to wither away. The economic foundation for the withering away of the state is established in the process of communist construction.

(F. Nikolayev: "On the Question of the Withering Away of the Socialist State")

Collective Farms Should Develop Industrial Production

The main condition for increasing labor productivity in agriculture is the mechanization and electrification of the production process, because mechanization and electrification can enable us to shorten operating times and adopt comprehensive mechanization according to the conditions of different agricultural areas. At the same time, the adoption of comprehensive mechanization requires the effective use of collective farm labor in new ways. For socialism, it is necessary to improve labor productivity in such a way that the increase in labor productivity not only reduces the labor consumption of each unit of product but also greatly increases the total output value of collective farms.

One of the ways to better use the labor force in collective farms is to develop certain industrial production, especially so-called sideline enterprises. Some may object that the development of these sectors will divert collective farmers from their primary tasks. In reality, with the development of agricultural mechanization, the phenomenon of collective farmers "detaching" from production already exists objectively and is strengthening. At the same time, the national economy suffers losses because a considerable proportion of the able-bodied residents do not create material wealth for several months of the year.

The second reason against the development of industrial production in collective farms is that labor productivity in collective farm enterprises is relatively low, and the cost of products is higher than in large industrial enterprises. This statement is not wrong in itself, but it cannot be the basis for opposing the development of industrial production in collective farms. First, industry currently cannot fully guarantee that collective farms and collective farmers obtain all the necessities, especially building materials, woodenware, certain daily necessities, etc.; second, if only reducing costs without simultaneously increasing the total amount of products, then reducing costs alone cannot solve the task of creating abundant products for the national economy. Therefore, we believe that it is incorrect to decide whether industrial production in collective farms is necessary only from the perspective of comparing product cost levels. The product cost of collective farm enterprises may be higher than that of large industrial enterprises, but under the condition of unchanged total output, the economic benefits derived from increasing total output are greater than the benefits derived from saving costs. Using the power of collective farms to establish enterprises can first win time to increase the production volume of products in the national economy.

(Su. Le. Zlomanov: "On Developing Industrial Production of Collective Farms")

Monetary Labor Remuneration Has Great Significance

There is a prevailing opinion in our country that in-kind relations in collective farms are always more advanced than commodity-monetary relations. The reasoning is this: since there are no commodity-monetary relations under the communist system, any in-kind relations in collective farms are "closer to communism" than commodity-monetary relations. However, in real life, this view is unfounded.

The monetary income of collective farms and collective farmers is growing faster than in-kind income. This is because commodity production is increasing more and more. At the same time, collective farmers increasingly prefer to receive currency rather than in-kind. Here, the following factors play a role: 1. With the increase in the income of collective farmers, the proportion of purchasing industrial products in their budgets increases; 2. With the growth of agricultural specialization, collective farmers need to purchase a large amount of agricultural products; 3. Collective farmers increasingly want to take advantage of the advantages of currency as a general equivalent when realizing their income. The example of grain can prove this. In many collective farms, collective farmers receive a large amount of grain according to labor days, but they are particularly worried about the sales problem.

Monetary labor remuneration can better combine distribution according to labor and the results of collective farm economic activities, thus more effectively utilizing all means of material incentives in the public economy. The growth and strengthening of the collective farm public economy, the development of commodity-monetary relations in collective farms, and the gradual promotion of the guaranteed monetary labor remuneration system for collective farmers will bring the collective farm ownership form closer to the form of ownership by the whole people, especially making work calculated in labor days gradually become directly calculated in currency. The labor day in collective farms has indeed played a huge role in the establishment and development of collective farms. However, at all stages of the development of socialism and the collective farm system, the labor day is by no means the only measure of labor and consumption in collective farms.

(Le. Gatovsky: "The Socialist Principle of Material Interests and the Utilization of Commodity-Monetary Relations")

Evaluating Economic Activities is Always Necessary

Evaluating the consumption and results of economic activities still has great significance in communist society, only the calculation form has fundamentally changed. This calculation form will increasingly lose its value nature and gradually become a direct social evaluation of the production consumption and results of individual economic units and regional units. This evaluation can be expressed in estimates and indexes. Without this evaluation, it is impossible to manage the communist economy.

In the initial stage of communism, when commodity production is still preserved, "...only by adopting the monetary form, that is, only by first going through social calculations in both quality and quantity" ("Complete Works of Lenin" Volume 1, page 385), can the products of commodity production reach consumers. In the advanced stage of communism, when distribution is according to need, the products of production do not need to become commodities or take monetary form to reach consumers, but planned calculations directly carried out by certain social institutions will be even more necessary than they are now.

    关于国家的消亡问题及其他
    编者按：“学习译丛”自今年年初改名为“学术译丛”后，已出版了三期。这三期都以主要的篇幅发表了苏联学者阐明和探讨关于共产主义建设的一些理论问题的文章，值得一读。下面是最近一期“学术译丛”上译载的几篇文章的摘要。
    国家消亡的前提条件
    随着社会主义的彻底胜利，帝国主义侵略势力进攻苏联和人民民主国家的这种威胁就没有了，结果，国防也就不需要了，保存军队和国家来解决外部任务也不需要了。这样，恩格斯关于社会主义革命胜利后国家消亡的公式就发生效力了。
    国家消亡的政治前提应当是：
    一、剥削阶级的消灭以及社会上精神和政治一致的建立。这个前提已经在我国建立了。在苏联，镇压被推翻了的剥削阶级反抗的职能消失了，我们的军队、侦查机关、惩罚机关是对付外部敌人的。
    二、社会主义民主的扩大。
    从社会主义社会向共产主义发展的内部条件来看，扩大社会主义民主是国家消亡的最重要的政治前提。完全的、彻底胜利的共产主义是没有国家的社会。但绝不能由此得出结论说，共产主义社会没有任何组织来调整人们的关系。共产主义是高度组织化的社会，它管理着庞大的、不断完善的生产，使科学、技术和艺术发展达到越来越高的水平，保证儿童和青年受到共产主义教育，保证一切人的全面发展，组织各尽所能和按需分配。十分清楚，共产主义社会的管理工作将由一定的社会组织来承担。同时也很清楚，这些组织不能由谁以现成的形式赋予共产主义社会。它们必须在社会沿着共产主义道路有机发展的过程中建立起来，必须逐步代替国家和国家机关。这个过程在我们的条件下一方面巩固和加强着社会主义国家，同时也准备着国家的未来消亡。共产党是准备国家将来消亡的主导力量，它在共产主义社会的建设中起着越来越重大的作用。
    三、社会主义的彻底胜利和社会主义阵营国家遭受侵犯危险的消除（这是社会主义革命在决定性的资本主义国家取得胜利的结果），也应当列为国家消亡的政治前提。这个胜利将意味着当代的基本矛盾——社会主义体系和资本主义体系之间的矛盾以有利于社会主义而获得解决。这将使国家逐渐丧失政治性质，使政治职能逐渐变成纯行政性的职能。
    国家消亡的经济前提是：为建立共产主义分配原则所必需的生产力的强大发展，体力劳动和脑力劳动之间、城市和乡村之间的本质差别的消灭，劳动成为人们生活的第一需要。要使国家消亡，必须有完全的共产主义。国家消亡的经济基础是在共产主义建设过程中建立起来的。
    （弗·尼科拉耶夫：“关于社会主义国家的消亡问题”）
    集体农庄要发展工业生产
    提高农业中劳动生产率的主要条件是生产过程的机械化和电力化，因为机械化和电力化能使我们缩短作业时间和根据不同农业区的情况采用全盘机械化。同时，采用全盘机械化，要求用新方法有效地使用集体农庄的劳动力。对于社会主义来说，必须这样来提高劳动生产率：劳动生产率的提高不仅能减少每一单位产品的劳动消耗，而且能大大提高集体农庄的生产总值。
    更好地使用集体农庄中劳动力的方法之一，是发展某些工业生产，特别是所谓副业企业。可能有人反对说，发展这些部门会使集体农民脱离他们的基本任务。实际上，随着农业机械化的发展，集体农民“脱离”生产的现象已经客观地存在着，而且正在加强。同时，正是由于相当多的一部分有劳动能力的居民一年内有好几个月不创造物质财富而使国民经济遭受损失。
    反对集体农庄发展工业生产的第二个理由，是集体农庄企业中的劳动生产率比较低，而产品成本却高于大工业企业。这种说法本身并没有错，可是它不能成为反对集体农庄发展工业生产的根据。第一，目前工业还不能充分保证集体农庄和集体农民获得一切必需品，特别是建筑材料、木器、某些日用品等等；第二，如果只是降低成本，而不同时增加产品总量，那么，降低成本的本身并不能解决为国民经济创造丰足的产品的任务。因此，我们认为，只从比较产品成本水平出发来决定集体农庄中工业生产是否必要，那是不正确的。集体农庄企业产品成本可能比大工业企业高一些，可是，在总产量不变的情况下，从增加总产量得来的经济利益要大于从节约成本得来的利益。用集体农庄的力量来创办企业，首先可以赢得时间来增加国民经济中的产品生产量。
      （苏·勒·兹洛玛诺夫：“论发展集体农庄的工业生产”）
    货币劳动报酬有巨大意义
    我国流行着这样一种意见，仿佛集体农庄中的实物关系始终比商品货币关系更先进。理由是这样的：既然共产主义制度下没有商品货币关系，那么集体农庄中的任何实物关系都比商品货币关系“更接近共产主义”。但是，在现实生活里，这种观点是没有根据的。
    集体农庄和集体农民的货币收入比实物收入增长得更快。这是因为商品生产越来越增加的缘故。同时，集体农民也越来越喜欢得到货币，而不愿得到实物。在这里，这样一些因素起着作用：一、随着集体农民收入的增加，在他们的预算中购买工业品的部分增加了；二、随着农业专业化的增长，集体农民要大量购买农产品；三、集体农民在实现自己的收入时，越来越想利用货币这种一般等价物的优点。拿谷物作例子就可证明这一点。在许多集体农庄里，集体农民按劳动日得到大量的谷物，但是他们特别担心出售问题。
    货币劳动报酬能够把按劳分配和集体农庄经济活动的结果更好地结合起来，因而在公有经济中能够更有效地利用物质刺激的一切手段。集体农庄公有经济的增长和加强、集体农庄商品货币关系的发展、集体农民有保证货币劳动报酬制的逐渐推广，将使集体农庄所有制形式同全民所有制形式接近起来，特别是使工作按劳动日计算逐渐变为直接按货币计算。集体农庄的劳动日在集体农庄的建立和发展中的确起了巨大的作用。但是在社会主义和集体农庄制度发展的一切阶段上，劳动日决不是集体农庄唯一的劳动尺度和消费尺度。
      （勒·加托夫斯基：“社会主义物质利益原则和商品货币关系的利用”）
    评价经济活动永远需要
    评价经济活动的消耗和成果，就是到共产主义社会还是有它的巨大意义，只是计算形式有根本改变。这种计算形式将越来越要失去价值性质，并逐渐变为个别经济单位和地域单位生产消耗和成果的直接社会评价。这种评价可以用估计数字和指数表现出来。没有这种评价，也就不可能管理共产主义经济。
    在共产主义的最初阶段，还保存着商品生产的时候，“……只有采取货币形式，就是说，只有预先经过质量和数量两方面的社会计算”（“列宁全集”第一卷385页），商品生产的产品才能到达消费者手里。在共产主义高级阶段，按需要进行分配的时候，生产的产品不必变成商品，也不采取货币形式就能到达消费者手里，但是直接由一定社会机构进行的有计划的计算，将比现在还更加必要。
          （弗·涅莫奇诺夫：“国民经济计划化的若干问题”）
