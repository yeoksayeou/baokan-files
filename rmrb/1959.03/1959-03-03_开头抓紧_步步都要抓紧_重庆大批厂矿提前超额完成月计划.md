Grasp Tightly from the Beginning, Grasp Tightly at Every Step
Chongqing's Large Number of Factories and Mines Fulfill and Exceed Monthly Plans Ahead of Schedule

    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd dispatch) Many factories in Chongqing, such as Jiangling Machine Factory, Changshou Chemical Factory, Chongqing Asbestos Factory, and Xiyuan Motor Factory, have fulfilled and exceeded their February production plans five to ten days ahead of schedule. Currently, workers in various factories are taking advantage of this momentum to discuss and arrange tasks for March, striving to fulfill and exceed the state plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule.
    This year, according to the action slogan of "Grasp Tightly from the Beginning, Grasp Tightly from Beginning to End" proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Party committees of these factories have widely organized workers to launch a surge of competition. All factories have universally held plant-wide mobilization rallies and skill competitions. Workshops and workshops, departments and departments, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals have enthusiastically launched challenges and responses, formulating plans separately, pushing production to a new peak. Many departments persisted in production even during the Spring Festival. Many factories launched a "High Production Movement Week" immediately after the Spring Festival.
    During the competition, workers in various factories closely focused on key production issues and carried out a vigorous technical revolution. The workers of Jiangling Machine Factory widely launched a technical revolution movement centering on increasing production and saving raw materials. Under the principle of ensuring product quality, they first rationally simplified product design structures and improved processing techniques, maximizing the effectiveness of raw materials. After the workers in the motorized workshop simplified the design structure according to actual production needs, the metal materials that were originally used to make twenty yuan vehicles could now produce one hundred and twenty automatic yuan vehicles. After the workers in the 13th workshop changed the bearing ring production from machining to hot stamping, they used scrap steel to make 10,000 bearing rings in February. In addition, the factory workers also tried their best to produce raw materials themselves and use substitutes. Due to the increase in raw materials, the entire factory overfulfilled the February plan six days ahead of schedule.
    This year, various factories have made great efforts to improve labor efficiency and improve transportation. Many leading cadres went deep into the workshops to work alongside workers to address key issues in these areas. Party committee members of Changshou Chemical Factory went to the workshops to help workers summarize advanced operational experiences and promote them, increasing the factory's daily hydrochloric acid production from 15 tons to 45 tons. Various factories also solved the problem of insufficient transportation capacity inside and outside the factories, ensuring the normal progress of production. Workers from Chongqing Asbestos Factory and Changshou Chemical Factory adopted methods such as making their own transportation tools to solve transportation difficulties through self-reliance. Chongqing Asbestos Factory dispatched more than 30 people to transport back more than 2,000 tons of asbestos, carbonic acid, and white clay.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd dispatch The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, after successfully overfulfilling the rolling steel task in January, overfulfilled and rolled out 2,369 tons of high-quality steel for the country in February.
    In February, the rolling mills and related auxiliary equipment of the company underwent major and medium repairs, and the actual production time was much less than in January. In order to ensure the completion of the February rolling steel task, the workers carried out a technical revolution with greater vigor, shortening the repair time and creating favorable conditions for overfulfilling the February plan.
    The workers of the rolling mill also launched a high-yield and high-quality competition in February, creating many new production records. The section steel segment of the large rolling mill created a new record of 516 tons of open billets, more than 100 tons higher than the previous highest record. The roll changing time was also shortened from the original 16 to 20 hours to 4 hours; the average daily output of the small rolling mill in February reached more than 500 tons, an increase of more than 100 tons compared with the average daily output of the previous month.

### 开头抓紧　步步都要抓紧  重庆大批厂矿提前超额完成月计划

    开头抓紧　步步都要抓紧
    重庆大批厂矿提前超额完成月计划
    本报重庆2日电　重庆江陵机器厂、长寿化工厂、重庆石棉厂、西原电机厂等许多工厂都提前五天到十天超额完成了2月份生产计划。目前各厂职工正乘胜抓紧讨论、安排3月份的任务，力争提前超额完成第一季度国家计划。
    今年这些工厂的党委根据中共四川省委提出的“一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的行动口号，广泛组织职工开展竞赛热潮。各厂普遍召开了全厂誓师大会、比武大会。车间与车间、部门与部门、小组与小组、个人与个人之间都热烈掀起挑战、应战，分别制定规划，把生产推向一个更新的高峰。许多部门在春节也坚持生产。不少厂一过春节就掀起“高产运动周”。
    各厂职工在竞赛中紧紧围绕生产关键问题，大闹技术革命。江陵机器厂职工以增产节约原材料为中心广泛开展技术革命运动。他们在保证产品质量的原则下，首先合理简化了产品设计结构和改进了加工工艺，使原材料最大限度发挥效用。机动车间职工根据生产实际需要简化了设计结构后，原来做二十台元车的金属材料，可以生产一百二十台自动元车。十三车间职工生产轴承套环由车加工改为热冲压加工后，2月份就利用零星边角钢材制了一万个轴承套环。此外，这个厂的职工还尽量自己生产原材料和采用代用品。由于原材料增多，全厂提前六天超额完成2月份计划。
    今年各厂在提高劳动效率和改善运输方面作了很大努力。许多领导干部针对这些方面的关键问题深入车间与工人跟班劳动。长寿化工厂党委委员分别到车间帮助工人总结操作上的先进经验，加以推广，使这个厂的盐酸日产量由十五吨提高到四十五吨。各厂还解决了厂内外运输力不足的问题，保证了生产的正常进行。重庆石棉厂、长寿化工厂职工采取自制运输工具等办法自力更生解决运输困难。重庆石棉厂抽出三十多人运回石棉、炭酸、白泥等二千多吨。
    新华社重庆2日电　重庆钢铁公司的职工在胜利超额完成1月份轧钢任务以后，在2月份又超额为国家多轧出二千三百六十九吨质量很好的钢材。
    2月份这个公司的轧钢机及有关的辅助设备都进行了大、中检修，实际生产时间比1月份减少很多。职工们为了保证完成2月份的轧钢任务，以更大的干劲大闹技术革命，缩短检修时间，为超额完成2月份计划创造了有利条件。
    轧钢厂的职工在2月份还开展了高产高质竞赛，创造了不少生产新纪录。大型轧钢厂型钢段开胚创造了五百一十六吨新纪录，比过去最高的纪录还高一百多吨，换辊时间也由原来十六到二十个小时缩短为四小时；小型轧钢厂2月份的平均日产量达到五百吨以上，比上月平均日产量提高一百多吨。（附图片）
