    Wheat Rust Prevention Methods

    Stripe Rust: In areas with overwintering sources of inoculum, stripe rust is currently mainly occurring in early-sown wheat fields. These areas must take active measures after the wheat turns green to completely eliminate the overwintering pathogens. The method of elimination is to conduct a general survey and treatment of diseased wheat fields within fifteen to twenty days after the wheat turns green. If disease centers are found, first eliminate the diseased leaves by burying the soil and cutting the leaves. Then, remove all the wheat leaves within and two feet outside the disease center to eliminate latent inoculum. When a single diseased leaf is found, the wheat leaves within one foot around it should also be removed while burying and cutting the diseased leaf. All treated areas should be marked for future inspection and cleanup.

    Starting twenty days after the wheat turns green, when spore heaps appear in large numbers, 3% ammonium sulfate solution or a 1:1 mixture of fresh urine and water can be sprayed first on marked areas or areas where diseased leaves are found. After spraying the diseased leaves, a 0.5-degree lime-sulfur mixture should be sprayed on the area five to ten feet around the diseased leaves. If sodium fluoride is available, a 300-fold solution of sodium fluoride can also be sprayed. Each spraying treatment should be carried out every five days, for a total of three to four treatments. In areas with castor bean leaves, a mixture of castor bean leaf juice and lime-sulfur mixture can be boiled and sprayed. After the wheat begins to joint, late-sown wheat fields should also be inspected and treated.

    During the wheat booting to heading stage, if the disease tiller rate reaches 0.1%, various protective agents should be used for comprehensive spraying.

    Leaf Rust: After winter wheat turns green, a general inspection should be carried out in early-sown or previously affected plots. If the disease incidence rate reaches 0.1% in a wheat field, various protective agents should be sprayed immediately, once every ten days, for a total of two sprays. Then, continue to spray twice until the booting stage, with an interval of ten days each time. Generally, wheat fields do not need to be sprayed after turning green, but regular inspections are needed. If the disease incidence rate reaches 0.1% before the booting stage, spraying protection is required.

    Stem Rust: In stem rust epidemic areas, if the disease starts to occur around the heading stage or a large number of spores appear at this time, there is a high possibility of a large-scale outbreak. Generally, around the heading stage, if the disease incidence rate reaches 1% based on stems, chemical control is needed. The treatment should be sprayed every seven to ten days, for a total of three to four sprays.

    小麦锈病防治法
    条锈病：在有越冬菌源的地区，目前条锈病主要发生在早播麦田里。这些地区必须在小麦返青后，采取积极措施，将越冬病菌消灭干净。消灭的方法是在返青后的十五到二十天以内，对发病麦田进行普查普治，发现传病中心，就用埋土切叶的方法先把病叶消灭掉，然后把传病中心以内和以外二市尺处的麦叶，全部摘净，以消灭潜伏菌源。发现单片病叶的时候，也应该在埋切病叶的同时，把一市尺周围的麦叶摘净。防治后的地方都应当插上标记，以便日后检查和肃清。
    从小麦返青后二十天起，病菌孢子堆出现较多，可在插有标记或发现有病叶的地方，先喷3％硫铵水或一比一的生尿水。在向有病叶的地方喷药以后，还要用零点五度的石灰硫黄合剂向病叶周围五——十市尺处喷射。如有氟化钠时，也可用三百倍的氟化钠水溶液喷射。各项喷药处理每隔五天进行一次，共防治三到四次。在有蓖麻叶的地方，可用蓖麻叶熬煮叶汁和石硫合剂的混合喷射。在小麦拔节以后，对迟播麦田也要开始检查防治。
    在小麦孕穗期到抽穗期，如发现病蘖率达到千分之一时，就应该用各种保护性药剂进行全面的喷射。
    叶锈病：在冬麦返青以后，应在早播或冬季曾经发生过的地块进行普遍检查，对病株率已达千分之一的麦田要立即喷射各种保护药剂，每隔十天喷一次，共喷二次，以后至打苞期再连续喷二次药，每次间隔十天。一般麦田返青以后不需要喷药，但需要定期检查，在打苞期以前如发现病株率达到千分之一时，就需要喷药保护。
    秆锈病：在秆锈病流行地区，如抽穗前后即开始发病，或在此时开始有大量孢子出现，就有大量发生可能。一般情况在抽穗前后，以秆计算发病率达到1％时，即需进行药剂防治。防治每隔七——十天喷药一次，共喷三——四次。
