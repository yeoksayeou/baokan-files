The middle reaches of the Wu River, a 200-plus kilometer waterway that for thousands of years has been forced into segmented navigation due to dangerous shoals, is now fully navigable. At present, the river is filled with sails and bustling with transport activity.

This Wu River, once crossed by the Red Army in a daring feat, is the largest river in Guizhou Province, with its main stream and tributaries passing through more than thirty counties and cities in the province. The basin is rich in surface and underground resources. However, because of the many shoals and rapid currents, the upper reaches are currently not navigable. Even the navigable middle reaches, until recently, had to be navigated in three sections. This not only affected transportation speed and increased cargo damage but also required approximately 200,000 yuan in cargo handling fees at the shoals and a large amount of labor each year.

In order to develop Wu River shipping, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Transportation, starting in 1958, used blasting and channel clearing methods in the 212 kilometers between Wenjiadian in Sinan and Gongtan. They opened up the Xin Tan and Chao Di shoals, known as the Wu River's natural barriers, creating a shallow-water tugboat channel from Sinan directly to Gongtan. (Illustration by Miao Di)

### 乌江中游全线通航

    乌江中游全线通航
    新华社讯　千百年来由于受险滩阻碍而不得不分段航行的乌江中游二百多公里航道，现在已经全线通航。目下，江上樯帆相接、百舸争流，呈现一片繁忙运输景象。
    当年红军曾经飞渡过的这条乌江，是贵州省最大的河流，它的干流和支流经过全省三十多县市。流域内，地上、地下资源丰富。但是，因为滩多水急，上游目前还没有通航，就是通航的中游，在不久以前也须分三段航行，这不仅影响运输速度，增加货物损失，而且每年需耗费约二十万元的货物搬滩费和大量的劳动力。
    为了发展乌江航运，贵州省交通部门从1958年开始，在思南文家店到龚滩的二百一十二公里间，用爆破清槽的办法，打通了号称乌江天险的新滩和潮砥两处断航滩险，开辟了思南直达龚滩的浅水拖轮航道。（苗地插图）
