Relying on the masses, advancing at a tremendous pace! This is the unanimous comment of the delegates attending the National Experience Exchange Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Five Major Parasitic Diseases after visiting Chen County, Hunan Province, the first county to basically eliminate filariasis.

Last year, the county adopted the method of mobilizing the entire Party, mobilizing the entire population, combining Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and relying on the masses to send away the God of Plague. From the end of June to the end of September, more than 250,000 people out of more than 270,000 people in the county underwent blood smear examinations, discovering more than 30,000 filariasis patients, who were immediately given medication to kill microfilariae. According to recent typical materials from various places tracking and re-examining more than 2,000 patients over the past eight months, the microfilariae in the blood of more than 90% of the patients have been killed, fundamentally eliminating the root cause of the disease.

It is estimated that the county can increase more than 480,000 labor days per year. Recently, when we visited the rural areas of Chen County, we saw many former "big foot" patients whose swollen legs had subsided and were plowing the fields with oxen in the spring.

Can "Big Foot" Disease Be Eliminated?

Filariasis is a chronic parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Because a type of "filaria" parasitizes the human lymphatic glands, causing symptoms such as swollen legs and itching, it is medically called filariasis, and the masses usually call it "itching and bleeding," "elephantiasis," and "big foot" disease. This disease has been prevalent in the mountainous areas of Chen County for more than 100 years. People with this disease generally have an attack once or twice a month. When the disease occurs, they experience chills and fever, and they are bedridden for four or five days and unable to work. Especially in the late stages of the disease, both legs swell up like "buckets," making it difficult to walk and causing extreme pain. According to investigations, there are more than 30,000 filariasis patients in the county, of which the main labor force accounts for about two-thirds. The county loses more than 400,000 labor days each year due to this.

In the spring of last year, the Chen County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on summarizing the experience of basically eliminating malaria, proposed a plan to eliminate filariasis through one year of hard work. At first, some cadres lacked confidence. They believed that in the past, some experts from the province had conducted experiments on eliminating filariasis in Xujiadong, Chen County, but after treating 480 patients for five years, not all of them were cured. The county had poor technical conditions, so proposing to eliminate it in one year was too bold. However, most cadres believed that in the past two or three years, the county had cured more than 50,000 malaria patients, basically ending the situation of "people getting malaria when they come to Chenzhou." Malaria affects a wide area and has many patients, but it can be eradicated, so why can't "big foot" disease be eliminated more quickly?

The county Party committee supported the latter opinion and helped everyone analyze the favorable conditions and difficulties at that time. First of all, the Party committee was determined, and the masses had an urgent need for treatment. In addition, the masses had rich experience in fighting filariasis for many years; there were also more than 330 traditional Chinese medicine doctors and herbal doctors distributed in every corner of the county, as well as more than 2,600 rural health workers who had grown up in the battle to eliminate malaria. These were all favorable conditions for eliminating "big foot" disease and were also the main aspects of the problem.

Thus, a five-person leading group headed by Yin Hui, deputy secretary of the county Party committee, was established, and specialized agencies were established at each level. The method of "unified leadership, overall planning, prioritizing the severe cases, and gradually nibbling away" was adopted. In June, the battle to eliminate "big foot" disease was launched throughout the county.

Initially, there were no professional medical cadres. They extracted 60 traditional Chinese medicine doctors from 27 rural traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, plus more than 20 cadres transferred from the county's health department, forming a professional medical team of more than 80 people. Among these medical personnel, only four were traditional Chinese medicine physicians, and the vast majority were young traditional Chinese medicine apprentices, but after short-term training, they were able to diagnose and prescribe medicines while doing and learning. Without microscopes, they concentrated the microscopes used for experiments in schools, plus the 27 provided by the province, which were basically enough. Without medicines, the province provided 900,000 tablets of "Haiqunsheng," and they also mobilized the masses to contribute more than 200 indigenous prescriptions, and the problem of Chinese-Western cooperation was gradually solved.

Medical Work Must Follow the Mass Line

After the medical teams arrived in the pilot townships, the question of how to implement the mass line in medical work was raised. Initially, some health cadres only knew how to deliver medicines to people's doors and ask them to take them, but they were not good at doing ideological mobilization work. Due to long-term failure to cure "big foot" disease, many people in the masses regarded it as an incurable disease. Many patients were also afraid that spending money would not cure the disease and that taking "Haiqunsheng" would cause large reactions and affect work. Therefore, at first, some health cadres offered free treatment to the masses, but they were turned away.

In May, 80 medical cadres from the county were concentrated for rectification and training. Led by Xiao Zuomin, member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee and Deputy County Head, everyone looked for the reasons. The conclusion was: medical cadres must not only learn to diagnose and prescribe medicines for the masses, but also learn to do publicity and education work for the masses. Only on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses can treatment and prevention work be carried out. Relying solely on a few medical cadres cannot solve the problem.

Later, Deputy County Head Xiao personally led the medical cadres to the pilot townships. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, in coordination with the central work, combining production, labor was comprehensively arranged, and treatment was carried out in batches and phases. Because filariae are active in human blood and only enter the epidermis at night, the general survey and blood smear work were arranged at night to avoid affecting production. Combining the various meetings to deploy the central work, they amplified the microfilariae in the blood smears through microscopes and made slides to show to the masses, effectively breaking the superstitious ideas among the masses; at the same time, combining the publicity of the harm of "big foot" disease, they mobilized the masses to speak out and debate, calculating the health loss account, the work attendance account, the income gain and loss account, and the treatment benefit account of "big foot" disease, and organized filariasis patients to pour out their sufferings and carry out a comparison of the new and old societies. In this way, the masses consciously sought medical treatment, and many rural health workers and Party and Youth League activists, after short-term training, helped the medical teams make blood smears, create rosters, write medical records, and carry out general surveys and treatment work. Lei Zengxiu, a female member of the Communist Youth League from Bailudong Agricultural Cooperative, assisted the medical team in doing more than 130 blood smear examinations in one night after a short period of study. In the past, it took more than two months to survey and treat the patients in one township during the pilot township period, but later it generally only took about ten days. After three or four months of fighting filariasis, the more than 80 traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel in the medical team not only learned the techniques of examining and treating filariasis, but also preliminarily learned how to do mass work. Among them, 36 medical personnel were rated as advanced workers by the masses.

Relying on the Masses to Overcome Difficulties

After the masses were mobilized, many difficult problems in medical work were solved easily, and the technological innovation of medical methods was a great initiative.

Originally, according to the books, the past treatment of filariasis was to adopt a small-dose, long-course treatment method. This method took 57 days to cure one patient and cost about 30 yuan in medical expenses. Obviously, it was impossible to eliminate filariasis in the whole county within one year by taking this path. How can we eliminate filariasis quickly, well, and economically? This question was sharply raised.

At this time, the medical personnel who were piloting in Banqiao Township discovered a new situation during the treatment of patients: because the reaction to taking "Haiqunsheng" was large, some patients were unwilling to take the medicine again after taking it once. However, after examining the blood of these patients, the microfilariae had basically been eliminated. So they conducted a treatment trial of 1.5 grams per day on more than 1,000 patients, and the effect was very good. Later, after another treatment trial of one gram by Youth League member and medical officer Ou Xueqing and other medical personnel on more than 480 patients, the curative effect reached more than 90%. This new treatment method of one gram at a time not only shortened the medication time and reduced the suffering of the patients, but also reduced the amount of medication, costing only about 0.6 yuan to treat a patient. In this way, in practice, they found a new path to eliminate filariasis quickly, well, and economically. After investigation and appraisal by the county Party committee and the Hunan Provincial Health Department, it was promoted throughout the county.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient "Haiqunsheng" medicine, local herbal doctor Huang Hengshan contributed an indigenous prescription for treating green bark water. According to preliminary efficacy observations of 44 cases, 86% of the microfilariae in the patients' blood were killed. The relevant departments are still conducting further research and observation.

How to deal with the vomiting, fever, and other reactions caused by taking "Haiqunsheng" medicine was also a difficult problem encountered in the battle to eliminate filariasis, but in the mass movement to contribute prescriptions, this difficulty was also overcome. The masses contributed more than 100 indigenous prescriptions such as eating danggui essence, strong tea, and ginger soup, all of which were very effective. Among them, eating danggui essence before taking the medicine was particularly effective. According to observations, in more than 40 cases, eating danggui essence before taking the medicine did not cause vomiting, fever, or bed rest.

The Cangzhu Fangji pill, Lingxian Ermiao decoction, acupuncture, and other prescriptions contributed by local indigenous medicine doctors have very good curative effects in reducing swelling of "big foot" disease. We saw more than a dozen "big foot" patients in Matouling, Chen County, who used the above prescriptions for medical treatment and basically reduced the swelling and recovered their health.

Creating an Environment for Eliminating Pests and Diseases

Practice has proved that adopting a comprehensive method that focuses on treating patients and combines mosquito control and individual protection is very effective. According to the comparison investigation materials on infection status in Xujiadong Township, Chen County, where different measures were taken by the Hunan Provincial Malaria Prevention and Control Institute, the new infection rate was about 30% in areas where only treatment or mosquito control work was carried out, while the new infection rate was about 5% in areas where treatment of patients and mosquito control work were carried out simultaneously.

In the past few years, the county has carried out mass movements to eliminate mosquitoes and eliminate the four pests in conjunction with eliminating malaria, and the mosquito density has been greatly reduced. Last summer, the county launched two mass mosquito control movements of "every household lights a fire, every household emits smoke" every month. It is difficult to find mosquitoes in some places. An official from the Hunan Provincial Malaria Prevention and Control Institute told reporters that in August last year, they spent more than 40 days in Chen County to catch 100 mosquitoes for dissection experiments. In the past, they had to catch several hundred mosquitoes a day.

Recently, when we visited the rural areas of Chen County, the representatives felt that the patriotic health movement here was carried out very well. Toilets, cattle pens, and pig pens were moved outside the village, and lime powder was often sprinkled. Everywhere was clean and bright. This is also a major reason why Chen County was able to eliminate filariasis in ninety days.

Naturally, the adoption of comprehensive prevention and control measures also varies depending on the time and place. For example, in winter, they concentrate their efforts on treatment work. In the summer and autumn, when there are many mosquitoes, they carry out mass mosquito control movements, the masses dig up local herbs and boil them as medicine to eat, and preventing various infectious diseases has begun to become a habit of the masses here. According to statistics on February 10, more than 2,600 local medicine factories have been established in the county, and more than 8,800 old farmers have formed professional teams to dig up local medicines, digging up more than 210,000 catties of various local medicines. All the people's commune public canteens in the county boil local medicine as tea to drink. When the representatives visited Matouling in Chen County, they all ate local medicine tea that was very effective in preventing meningitis and other infectious diseases. They all felt that this mass prevention method was very good, and many people copied these local prescriptions and took them back.

Now, the battle to eliminate filariasis in this county has entered a new stage, that is, the stage of repeated sweeps and consolidating victories, because more than 10,000 floating population in the county who were not blood-tested during the general survey last year is a big loophole; secondly, according to the law of filariasis, after being infected with microfilariae, it can incubate in the human body for one year, and some may not have been discovered during the general survey last year; finally, some pregnant women and people with lung diseases were not treated during the treatment last year. Under the current conditions, it is still impossible to completely eliminate all mosquitoes at once, and it is entirely possible that new patients will be infected. According to the results of a recent key re-examination conducted by the county's health department in cooperation with more than 50 teachers and students from Hunan Medical College in four areas, although the general curative effect is very good, two or three newly infected patients are still found in every 100 people. Therefore, the county Party committee has decided to launch a re-examination and fire-filling movement throughout the county recently. Strive to eliminate filariasis cleanly and thoroughly throughout the county and protect the people's health. (Attached pictures)

    群策群力送瘟神
    ——记郴县奋战九十天基本消灭丝虫病
    本报记者　胡坚　李国华
    “依靠群众、一日千里”！这是参加全国防治五大寄生虫病经验交流会议的代表们，最近参观湖南省第一个基本消灭丝虫病的郴县后一致的评语。
    这个县去年采取全党动员、全民动手、中西并举、土洋结合、群策群力送瘟神的办法，从6月底到9月底止，在全县二十七万多人中有二十五万多人进行了血片检查，发现三万多名丝虫病患者，当即普遍服药，杀灭微丝蚴。根据最近各地八个月来追踪复查二千多名病人的典型材料说明，有90％以上的病人血液中的微丝蚴杀死了，基本上断了病根。
    估计全县每年可增加四十八万多个劳动日。最近，我们在郴县农村参观时，就看到许多过去的“大脚”病人，现在肿腿消了，喝着牛在春耕。
  “大脚”病能不能消灭？
    丝虫病是一种由蚊子传染的慢性寄生虫病，因为一种“丝虫”寄生在人体淋巴腺内，引起肿腿、生痒等症状，医学上叫丝虫病，群众通常叫“痒子下血”、“象皮腿”和“大脚”病。这种病在郴县山区流行一百多年了。有这种病的人。一般每月要发一、两次，病一发作，就畏寒发烧，一倒床就是四、五天爬不起来，不能出工，特别是晚期病，双腿肿得像个“提桶”，连走路也拖不动，痛苦极了。据调查，全县有三万多名丝虫病人，其中主要劳动力约占三分之二。全县每年因此损失的劳动日有四十多万个。
    去年春天，中共郴县县委在总结基本消灭疟疾的经验基础上，提出苦战一年消灭丝虫病的规划。开始有些干部信心不足。他们认为过去省里一些专家在郴县许家洞作消灭丝虫病的实验，四百八十多个病人治疗了五年也没全治好，县里技术条件差，提出一年消灭，未免太大胆了。但是大多数干部却认为过去两、三年全县治好了五万多疟疾病人，基本上结束了“人到郴州打摆子”的局面。疟疾面大、病人多，都能扑灭，为什么不能更快地消灭“大脚”病呢？
    县委支持了后一种意见，并帮助大家具体分析了当时的有利条件和困难方面。首先，党委决心大，群众治病要求迫切；再加上群众有多年来向丝虫病作斗争的丰富经验；还有分布全县每个角落的三百三十多名中医和草药郎中，以及在消灭疟疾战斗中成长起来的二千六百多名农村卫生员。这些都是消灭“大脚”病的有利条件，也是问题的主要方面。
    于是，以县委副书记尹辉为首成立了五人领导小组，层层建立专业机构。采取“统一领导，全面规划，先重后轻，逐块蚕食”的办法。6月间消灭“大脚”病的战斗就在全县铺开了。
    开始没有专业的医疗干部，他们从二十七个农村中医院中抽出六十名中医，加上县里卫生部门抽调的二十多名干部，就组成一支八十多名的专业医疗队，这些医疗人员中，只有四名中医师，绝大部分是年轻的中医学徒，但是他们经过短期训练，在边做边学中，都能看病处方。没有显微镜，他们把学校里实验用的显微镜集中起来，加上省里支援的共有二十七台，基本上够用。没有药品，省里支援了九十万片“海群生”，他们又发动群众献了二百多种土药方，中西合作问题就逐步解决了。
    医疗工作要走群众路线
    医疗工作队一到试点乡，医疗工作如何贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法这个问题就提出来了。开始，有些卫生干部只知道送药上门，叫群众吃药，不善于做思想发动工作，而群众中由于长期患“大脚”病治不好，许多人把它看成不治之症。还有不少病人怕花了钱治不好病，怕服“海群生”反应大，影响出工。因此，开始有些卫生干部免费上门给群众治病，反而给顶回来了。
    5月间，全县八十名医疗干部集中整训，由县委常委、副县长萧作民领导大家找原因，结论是：医疗干部不仅要学会给群众看病、处方，而且要学会向群众做宣传教育工作，只有在充分发动群众的基础上，才能开展治疗预防工作，单靠几个医疗干部是不能解决问题的。
    后来，由萧副县长亲自带领医疗干部到试点乡，在当地党委统一领导下，配合中心工作，结合生产，全面安排劳力，分批分期地进行治疗，由于丝虫在人体血液中活动，只有在晚间才进入表皮的特有规律，因此普查、做血片等工作，都安排在晚间进行，不影响生产。结合布置中心工作的各种会议，他们将血片中的微丝蚴，通过显微镜放大，制成幻灯，放映给群众看，有力地破除了群众中的迷信思想；同时，结合宣传“大脚”病的危害性，发动群众鸣放辩论，算得“大脚”病的健康损失账、出工、收入得失账和治疗好处账，组织丝虫病人诉苦，开展新、旧社会的回忆对比。这样一来，群众就纷纷自觉就医，许多农村卫生员和党、团员积极分子，经过短期训练后，帮助医疗队制血片、造名册、写病历，开展普查、治疗工作。白鹿洞农业社女共青团员雷增秀经过短期学习，一个晚上就协助医疗队做了一百三十多个的血片检查工作，从前搞试点乡时，要花两个多月时间才能普查、治疗一个乡的病人，后来一般只要十天左右就行了。医疗队的八十多名中、西医务人员，经过三、四个月的灭丝虫病的战斗，不仅学会了检查和治疗丝虫病的技术，而且初步学会了做群众工作，他们中间有三十六名医疗人员被群众评为先进工作者。
    依靠群众突破了难关
    群众发动起来后，许多医疗工作中的难题就迎刃而解了，医疗方法的技术革新，就是一个伟大的创举。
    本来，根据书本记载，过去治丝虫病是采取小剂量长程疗法的，这种办法治好一个病人要五十七天，需医药费三十元左右。显然，全县要在一年内消灭丝虫病，走这条路是走不通的。究竟如何才能多快好省地把丝虫病消灭呢？这个问题就尖锐地提出来了。
    正在这个时候，在板桥乡作试点的医务人员在治疗病人中发现一个新的情况：因为服
  “海群生”反应大，有些病人服一次药就不愿再服了。但是，经过检查这些病人的血液中，微丝蚴还是基本消灭了。于是他们就在一千多病人中采取一日一点五克的治疗试验，效果很好。后来，经过共青团员、医士欧学卿等医务人员又在四百八十多名病人中作了一次一克的治疗试验，疗效达到90％以上。这种新的一次一克的治疗方法，不仅缩短了服药时间，减少了病人的痛苦，而且减少了用药量，治疗好一个病人只花六角钱左右。就这样，在实践中他们找到了一条多快好省消灭丝虫病的新道路。经过县委和湖南省卫生厅的调查鉴定，就在全县推广开了。
    为了解决“海群生”药剂不足的问题，当地草药郎中黄恒山献出了青树皮水剂治疗土方。据四十四个病例的初步疗效观察，病人血液中86％的微丝蚴杀死了。有关部门，还在进一步研究观察中。
    如何处理服“海群生”药剂所引起的呕吐发烧等反应现象，也是在消灭丝虫病战斗中碰到的一个难题，可是，在发动群众献方运动中，这道难关也突破了。群众献出了吃当归精、浓茶、姜汤等一百多个土药方，都很有效，其中特别是服药前吃当归精，效果更为显著，据观察，四十多个病例，服药前吃当归精，都没有发生呕吐发烧卧床等现象。
    当地土药医师献出的苍术防已丸、灵仙二妙汤、针灸等药方，使“大脚”病消肿，疗效都很好。我们在郴县马头岭就看到十多个“大脚”病人，采用上述药方医疗，基本上消了肿，恢复了健康。
    造成除害灭病的环境
    实践证明：采取以治疗病人为主，结合进行灭蚊和个体防护的综合办法，收效很好。根据湖南省疟疾防治所在郴县许家洞乡采取不同措施的感染情况对比调查材料，单纯搞治疗或灭蚊工作的地区，新感染率均在30％左右，而治疗病人和灭蚊工作同时进行的地区，新感染率在5％左右。
    这个县过去几年中，结合消灭疟疾大搞除蚊灭四害的群众运动，蚊子密度大大降低了。去年夏天，全县又每月开展了两次“家家点火、户户冒烟”的群众性灭蚊运动。有些地方已很难找到蚊子了。湖南省疟疾防治所的一位负责人对记者谈，去年8月，他们在郴县花了四十多天才捉到一百个蚊子作解剖试验，要是过去他们一天要捉好几百只蚊子。
    最近，我们在郴县农村参观，代表们都感到这里爱国卫生运动开展得很好，厕所、牛栏、猪圈都搬到了村外，而且经常撒上石灰粉。到处窗明几净，清清洁洁。这也是为什么郴县能在九十天内消灭丝虫病的一个主要原因。
    自然，采取综合防治措施，也是因时因地不同的。比如，在冬天他们比较集中力量进行治疗工作，夏秋之交蚊子多，他们就开展群众性的灭蚊运动，群众性的挖土药、熬着当药吃，预防各种流行性疾病，在这里已开始成为群众的习惯。据2月10日统计，全县办起二千六百多个土药厂，有八千八百多个老农组成了挖土药的专业队，共挖各种土药二十一万多斤。全县人民公社公共食堂都熬土药当茶吃，代表们在郴县马头岭参观时，都是吃的预防脑膜炎等流行病很有效的土药茶，都感到这种群众性的预防办法很好，许多人把这些土药方抄回去了。
    现在，这个县的消灭丝虫病的战斗又进入一个新的阶段，即反复扫荡、巩固胜利的阶段，因为全县去年普查中尚有一万多名流动人口未进行血片检查，是一个大漏洞；其次，根据丝虫病的规律，感染微丝蚴后可以在人体内潜伏一年，去年普查时，有些可能没有发现；最后，去年治疗时一些孕妇和患肺病的人都未进行治疗。在目前条件下，蚊子还不可能一下子全部灭掉，完全可能感染发生新的病人。根据最近县里卫生部门配合湖南医学院下放的五十多名师生在四个地区进行重点复查结果，一般疗效虽然很好，但是每一百个人中仍发现两、三个新感染的病人。因此，县委决定最近在全县范围内开展一次复查、补火运动。力争干净、彻底地在全县范围内消灭丝虫病，维护人民健康。（附图片）
