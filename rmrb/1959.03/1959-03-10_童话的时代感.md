　　Flipping through children's books for lower grades and listening to radio broadcasts for pre-school children, one encounters many fairy tales.

　　These fairy tales are generally interesting and loved by children. They are mostly informative fairy tales drawn from folk stories and folk tales, educating children to be diligent, brave, honest, friendly, not arrogant, respect elders, help others..., helping children understand some simple natural phenomena and learn some scientific knowledge. But I always feel that the scope of our fairy tales seems a bit narrow. Many fairy tales still lack a distinct sense of the times.

　　Some say that fairy tales can only depict kings and fishermen, cats and swallows, and that if they are "too realistic" they are no longer fairy tales. This is a theoretical issue that needs to be studied by children's literature scholars and critics. But as a reader who loves fairy tales, I don't think this is necessarily the case. Don't we also read some fairy tales with a sense of the times? (For example, some of Gaidar's works, and some works by Chinese children's literature writers.) I think that fairy tales can also express major themes in current real life. For example, they can express the Great Leap Forward in production, or even international events, while still retaining the characteristics of a fairy tale.

　　We can't always confine the subject matter of fairy tales to kindergartens, families, and schools. We should use fairy tales, a charming and easily accepted form of expression for children, to broaden their horizons and enable them to understand life more widely and extensively.

　　If we don't do this, fairy tales will become a literary form that can never radiate a strong sense of the times.

### 童话的时代感

    童话的时代感
    翻翻专供低年级看的儿童读物，听听广播电台对学龄前儿童的广播，就会接触到许多童话。
    这些童话故事一般都是有趣的，为儿童所喜爱的。它们大都是取材自民间故事和民间童话的知识性的童话，教育儿童勤劳、勇敢、诚实、友爱、不骄傲、尊敬长者、帮助别人……，帮助儿童理解一些简单的自然现象，知道一些科学知识。但我总觉得我们的童话所涉及的范围，似乎狭窄了点。不少童话都还缺少鲜明的时代感。
    有人说，童话只能描写那些国王和渔夫，猫和燕子，“太现实了”就不叫童话。这是个理论问题，需要儿童文学家和评论家去研究。但是作为一个爱读童话的读者，我觉得并不一定如此。我们不是也读到一些具有时代感的童话吗？（例如盖达尔的一些作品，例如中国儿童文学家的一些作品）我觉得，童话也可以表现当前现实生活中的重大的题材。譬如说，可以表现生产大跃进，甚至于国际性的大事件，然而它仍可以具有童话的特色。
    不能老把童话的题材关在幼儿园里、家庭里、学校里。应该通过童话这个富有魅力，易于儿童接受的表现样式，扩大儿童的视野，使他们更多更广阔地认识生活。
    不这样做，童话就会变成一种永远无法发散着浓郁的时代气息的文学形式了。
