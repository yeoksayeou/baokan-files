Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Moscow dispatch: Moscow newspapers published on the 27th the speech delivered by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the Ninth All-German Workers' Conference in Leipzig on March 7th.

Khrushchev attended the conference at the formal invitation of the Standing Committee of the All-German Workers' Conference while visiting the Leipzig Fair in early March. He addressed workers and trade unionists from both Germanys at the conference and answered several questions regarding the peaceful resolution of the German question.

After briefly recounting the relationship between the Soviet Union and the capitalist world since the October Revolution, Khrushchev addressed the modern international situation. He said, we believe that war is not inevitable at present. This is not because the imperialists have become smarter or kinder, but because they have become weaker, and because the camp of peace is now stronger than ever.

Khrushchev said, it can be compared to this: the imperialists want to eliminate the socialist countries, just like a hungry wolf wants to eat a lion, but unfortunately, the wolf's appetite is too small, and its teeth are no longer useful - not sharp, worn out.

Khrushchev pointed out that the strength of the working class worldwide lies in its unity, its organization, and proletarian internationalism.

Khrushchev said that the international workers' movement now has a powerful and growing real force as its pillar. This force is the powerful camp of socialist countries, where power belongs to the working class and the working people.

Khrushchev said, we believe that if the imperialists launch a war against the socialist countries, then this war will inevitably end with the demise of capitalism. He said that in the struggle against the forces pursuing a "cold war" policy and expanding armaments, the socialist countries have their own great moral strength and considerable material strength as their pillar.

Khrushchev said, we know that the imperialists rarely consider moral principles; they recognize the rights of the strong. Therefore, the imperialists force us not only to rely on moral rights but also to use force to consolidate these rights. Khrushchev said, amidst stormy and prolonged applause, now there is such a force—the powerful socialist camp.

Khrushchev said that the international and domestic situation of the Soviet Union and all socialist countries is very good and very stable. The Soviet Union—a country where socialism has already triumphed—and other socialist countries are developing more and more prosperously.

Khrushchev said that the sun hangs high in the sky, shining brightly on every corner of the earth. Communism is the same; it rose from the Soviet state and has now risen to its zenith—the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are confidently advancing along the road of building socialism and communism. The smoke will clear, and the blind will regain their sight; they will see what is white and what is black. People of all countries will certainly be convinced that there is only one path to progress and a better life for all mankind—and that is the path to communism.

Khrushchev said that the German question is a key link in the issue of peace and war, and one of the fundamental sources of international friction and conflict. He said, that is why we are now and will continue to resolutely strive for the normalization of the German situation. Khrushchev continued, under the current conditions, the most sensible solution is to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys. He explained that concluding a treaty that confirms the situation that has already formed in Central Europe, without changing anything produced after the war, would be a decisive step towards normalizing the international situation and creating an environment of mutual trust.

Khrushchev continued, our two countries have fought two bloody wars against each other in fifty years. Now, a friendly and fraternal relationship has been established between the Soviet people and the German working people.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, have consistently advocated and still advocate the reunification of Germany. It was the ruling groups in the Western countries who clamored for the partition of Germany, and it was their unilateral actions that led to the division of your country. Our government and Stalin had steadfastly and consistently upheld the idea of German reunification. We still maintain this position now.

Khrushchev emphasized that the issue of German reunification should first of all be approached from a class standpoint. A person who represents the interests of the working class should not even have the thought that the workers and peasants of the German Democratic Republic, which has already established a worker-peasant state and is successfully building socialism, should lose all the fruits of their victory and agree to live under capitalist enslavement as in the past, due to the restoration of unity in Germany.

Khrushchev said that if we agree to reunify Germany on a capitalist basis, then this will be a humiliation for our workers in the eyes of future generations. Now, the capitalist world is trying to achieve the reunification of Germany at the expense of the interests of the German Democratic Republic, thereby reducing the socialist position. Can we agree to do this?

Khrushchev said, we were not born and do not live to make concessions to capitalism. We should adhere to the principle of proletarian internationalism.

Khrushchev said that if we now want to restore German unity by eliminating the capitalist system in West Germany and establishing a working-class regime there, it is unrealistic. He added that it is even more unrealistic to harbor illusions of eliminating the socialist achievements of the German Democratic Republic and depriving the worker-peasant regime of power.

Khrushchev pointed out that people in the capitalist world are now masquerading as defenders of democracy, advocating for all-German general elections. Khrushchev said that when they put forward this deceptive slogan, they forget that they have already tarnished their reputation once in a similar matter. Khrushchev reminded everyone of the Geneva Accords regarding elections in Vietnam. He said that an agreement was reached in Geneva to hold general elections in Vietnam in two years. However, two years have long passed, and the elections have still not been held because the imperialists know that if elections are held, then all the people of Vietnam will stand under the banner of the worker-peasant government.

Khrushchev added that the United States has put in more effort than anyone else to prevent free elections in Vietnam.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government advocates the restoration of German unity, and the German people will be reunited in the future. He said, it is only a matter of time. What is important here, of course, is on what basis reunification is restored.

Khrushchev said that it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty now, which is an important step towards restoring German unity. Conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys that actually exist.

Khrushchev recounted that the Soviet government proposed concluding peace treaties with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and we are now awaiting a response. In our view, it is best to conclude peace treaties with the two existing Germanys, but if it is not possible, we will have to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. Concluding a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic will have significant positive meaning. The German people will be able to obtain the peace treaty they have long awaited. If the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is unwilling to conclude a peace treaty, then the situation of the Federal Republic of Germany will become complicated.

Khrushchev pointed out that if a confederation of the two Germanys could be established now, that would also be very good. But the capitalists are afraid of a confederation. Khrushchev said that the capitalist gentlemen seem to want us, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, to help them eliminate the German Democratic Republic. No, gentlemen, we will not help you do such a dirty trick; we stand entirely on the side of the German working class.

Khrushchev especially talked about the issue of national borders. He said that history tells us that a confederation will not change national borders, and the current German borders may change due to war. But the current situation is such that both sides are quite rational and will not allow military action to be taken due to the issue of changing national borders. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the current state. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the current borders. Khrushchev pointed out that not only are Germans sensitive to the issue of national borders, but this issue is also very acute for many capitalist countries. Khrushchev pointed out that at the same time, as socialist revolutions win victories in some countries, the issue of national borders takes on a different nature and does not have the kind of acuteness that it has under the capitalist system. But this issue also exists in socialist countries. Khrushchev continued, but we believe that the issue of national borders is not the main thing for us communists. Conflicts cannot arise between socialist countries because of this issue.

Khrushchev continued that broad cooperation in economic, social, political, and cultural life is constantly developing between the sovereign states of the socialist camp. He said that if we talk about the future, I think that socialist countries will necessarily continue to develop along the lines of strengthening a unified world socialist economic system. The obstacles left over from the capitalist era that divide the economies of these countries will be eliminated one after another. The common economic foundation of world socialism will be consolidated, and this economic foundation will eventually make the issue of national borders an empty one.

Khrushchev said that the issue of national borders, in its current meaning, is gradually disappearing. No independent socialist country will close itself off or rely solely on its own strength and resources.

Khrushchev also pointed out that some heads of imperialist powers have repeatedly said in the post-war period that countries do not need to care about national sovereignty. What the imperialist powers are concerned about is abolishing the national independence of various countries in order to carry out economic and political enslavement of the people of these countries as they please, while the people of these countries have some possibility to protect their interests with the help of border and tariff systems.

Khrushchev continued that it is not difficult to believe that the heads and thinkers of imperialism, who call for restricting national sovereignty and weakening the customs barriers of other countries, are actually implementing policies aimed at making these countries subordinate to the interests of imperialist monopoly organizations. Under these circumstances, consolidating the national sovereignty of various countries is a progressive cause that helps consolidate the national independence of the people of various countries.

Khrushchev emphasized that we communists firmly believe in the reality of our plans and clearly envision what direction the relations between the peoples of the world should develop.

Khrushchev paid tribute to Walter Ulbricht at the All-German Workers' Conference for his resolute defense of the interests of the working class and the interests of the German people. Khrushchev said that it would not be bad, or even very good, if Otto Grotewohl led the government of the whole of Germany. But if the people of West Germany are not yet prepared for this, then don't worry, let the two Germanys exist. The two Germanys should engage in peaceful competition.

Khrushchev said that in the peaceful competition with capitalism, we will inspire the minds and hearts of workers and working people all over the world with our own achievements in the cause of socialist construction. In the near future, we will surpass the richest capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output, further shorten the working day, and achieve new achievements in the development of science and culture. By then, all the people of capitalist countries will be more convinced of the superiority of the socialist system and will decide for themselves whether they should continue to tolerate the capitalist system there.

Khrushchev concluded that the most important task for all of us at present is to maintain peace. The forces of peace are not only no weaker than the forces of war, but are stronger than them. The forces of peace in the world are growing, and the future definitely belongs to the forces of peace. Maintaining and strengthening the solidarity and unity of the working class around the world is of special significance for the struggle for peace and against war.

### 共产主义的太阳已升上顶空

    赫鲁晓夫对全德工人代表会议说
    共产主义的太阳已升上顶空
    社会主义国家满怀信心赢得和平竞赛的胜利
    德国问题是和平和战争问题的关键性环节
    缔结对德和约将能够促使国际局势正常化
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科报纸27日发表了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫3月7日在来比锡第九届全德工人代表会议上发表的演说。
    赫鲁晓夫是在3月初参观来比锡博览会时，应全德工人代表会议常委会的正式邀请而来参加这次代表会议的。他在代表会议上向来自两个德国的工人、工会工作者发表演说，并且回答有关和平解决德国问题的若干问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在简要地叙述了从十月革命以来苏联同资本主义世界之间的关系之后，就谈到了现代的国际局势。他说，我们认为，战争在现在不是不可避免的。这并不是因为帝国主义者变得更聪明或更善良了，而是因为他们变得羸弱了，是因为和平阵营现在比任何时候都更强大。
    赫鲁晓夫说，可以这样作个比方：帝国主义者想消灭社会主义国家，就像饿狼想吃掉狮子，不过倒霉的是：这只狼的胃口太小，而且牙齿也不管用了——不锐利了，磨坏了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，全世界工人阶级的力量在于它的团结，它的组织性和无产阶级的国际团结。
    赫鲁晓夫说，国际工人运动现在有一个日益壮大、日益巩固的强大的现实力量作为支柱。这个力量就是强大的社会主义国家阵营，这些国家里的政权属于工人阶级，属于劳动人民。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们相信，如果帝国主义者对社会主义国家发动战争，那么，这场战争必将以资本主义的灭亡而告终。他说，在同实行“冷战”政策和扩充军备的势力进行的斗争中，社会主义国家有着自己的伟大的道义力量和不小的物质力量作为支柱。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们知道，帝国主义很少考虑道义原则，它们承认强者的权利。因此，帝国主义迫使我们不仅要依靠道义权利而要用力量来巩固这种权利。赫鲁晓夫在暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声中说，现在有着这样的力量——强大的社会主义阵营。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联和所有社会主义国家的国际和国内情况是很好的、很稳固的。苏联——社会主义已经取得了胜利的国家——和其他社会主义国家正在日益蓬勃地发展。
    赫鲁晓夫说，太阳高挂在天空，光芒万丈地照耀着地球上的每一个角落。共产主义也是一样，它从苏维埃国家升起，现在已升上顶空——苏联和其他社会主义国家正满怀信心地沿着建设社会主义和共产主义的道路前进。烟幕将会消除，瞎子也会复明，他们将会看到什么是白的，什么是黑的。各国人民都必将确信，通向全人类进步、通向美好生活的道路只有一条——这就是通向共产主义的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫说，德国问题是和平和战争问题的一个关键性环节，是国际摩擦和冲突的基本根源之一。他说，正因为如此，我们现在和将来都要坚决争取德国局势的正常化。赫鲁晓夫接着说，在目前的条件下，和两个德国签订和约是最明智的解决办法。他解释说，确定欧洲中部已经形成的局面，丝毫不改变战后所产生的东西，这样来缔结和约将是走向国际局势正常化和创造双方信任环境的一个决定性步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我们两国在五十年来曾经互相进行过两次流血战争。现在，苏联人民和德意志劳动人民之间树立了友好兄弟关系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联、苏联人过去和现在一致主张德国统一。从前正是西方国家的统治集团大叫必须瓜分德国，正是它们的片面行动导致了你们国家的分裂。而我国政府和斯大林曾经坚决、一贯地坚持德国统一的主张。我们现在也坚持这个立场。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，对待德国重新统一的问题应当首先从阶级立场出发。一个代表工人阶级利益的人，根本不应该有这样的念头：由于在德国恢复统一而使已经建立了工农国家并正在顺利地建设社会主义的德意志民主共和国的工人和农民失去自己的全部胜利果实，并同意像过去那样，生活在资本主义的奴役之下。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果我们同意在资本主义基础上重新统一德国，那么，在后代子孙看来，这将是对我们工人的羞辱。现在，资本主义世界企图想靠损害德意志民主共和国的利益来实现德国的重新统一，从而缩小社会主义阵地，难道我们能够同意这样做吗。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们生下来和活着并不是为了向资本主义让步。我们应当坚持无产阶级国际主义原则。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果现在要通过消灭西德的资本主义制度和在那里建立工人阶级政权来恢复德国统一，这是不现实的。他补充说，但是，如果抱着要消灭德意志民主共和国的社会主义成果，抱着剥夺工农政权的幻想，那就更不现实了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，资本主义世界的人士现在装扮着民主保卫者的角色，主张举行全德国的普选。赫鲁晓夫说，当他们提出这个迷惑人心的口号的时候，他们忘记了：有一次在类似的事情上他们已经败坏了自己的名声。赫鲁晓夫提醒大家回忆一下关于在越南进行选举的日内瓦协议。他说，在日内瓦达成了关于两年后在越南举行普选的协议。但是，两年早已过去了，而选举依然没有举行，因为帝国主义者知道，如果举行选举，那么，全越南的人民便都会站到工农政府的旗帜下面来。
    赫鲁晓夫补充说，美国为了不允许在越南进行自由选举，所卖的力气比任何人都多。
    赫鲁晓夫着重说，苏联政府主张恢复德国统一，而德国人民将来也会重新统一的。他说，这不过是时间问题。这里很重要的当然是：在什么样的基础上恢复统一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在必须签订和约，这是恢复德国统一的一个重要步骤。同实际上存在着的两个德国签订和约。
    赫鲁晓夫追述说，苏联政府提出过同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国缔结和约的建议，我们现在正等待回答。依我们看，最好是同两个现存的德国签订和约，但如果办不到，我们就不得不同德意志民主共和国签订和约。同德意志民主共和国签订和约将会有重大的积极意义。德国人民将能得到他们久盼的和约。如果德意志联邦共和国政府不愿意签订和约，那么德意志联邦共和国的局势就会复杂起来。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，如果现在就可以建立两个德国的邦联，那也很好。不过资本家们害怕邦联。赫鲁晓夫说，资本家老爷们看来想让我们苏联和其他社会主义国家——帮助他们消灭德意志民主共和国。不，老爷们，我们不会帮助你们干这种肮脏勾当的，我们完全站在德国工人阶级这一边。
    赫鲁晓夫特别谈到了国界问题。他说，历史告诉我们，邦联不会改变国界，而目前德国的国界可能会由于战争而改变。但是目前的情况是这样：双方都相当理智，都不允许由于改变国界问题而采取军事行动。因此就得承认现在的国家。因此，就得要承认现在的国界。赫鲁晓夫指出，不仅是德国人对国界问题很敏感，这个问题对许多资本主义国家都是很尖锐的。赫鲁晓夫指出，在这同时，随着社会主义革命在一些国家获得胜利，国界问题有了另外一种性质，而不会是有像在资本主义制度下所有的那种尖锐性了。但是这个问题在社会主义国家中也是存在的。赫鲁晓夫接着说，不过我们认为，国界问题对我们共产党人来说不是主要的。社会主义国家中间不可能由于这个问题而发生冲突。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在社会主义阵营各个主权国家之间，经济、社会、政治和文化生活各方面的广泛合作不断发展。他说，如果谈到将来，我想，社会主义国家想必要沿着加强统一的世界社会主义经济体系的路线继续发展。资本主义时代遗留下来的使我们这些国家的经济分裂的障碍将一个接一个地被铲除。世界社会主义的共同经济基础将得到巩固，这种经济基础将最后使国界问题成为空洞的东西。
    赫鲁晓夫说，国界问题就它现在的含义来讲，正在逐渐消失。没有任何一个独立的社会主义国家会闭关自守或只依靠自己的力量和富源。
    赫鲁晓夫同时指出，一些帝国主义大国的头子们在战后时期一再说什么国家不需要关心民族主权。帝国主义大国所关心的是取消各国的民族独立，以便为所欲为地对这些国家人民进行经济和政治奴役，而这些国家的人民借助疆界和关税制度就有某种可能来保护自己的利益。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，不难相信，帝国主义的头子们和思想家们号召限制民族主权、削弱其他国家的海关壁垒，实际上是在实行旨在使这些国家服从于帝国主义大垄断组织的利益的政策。在这种情况下，巩固各国的民族主权是有助于巩固各国人民的民族独立的进步事业的。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，我们共产党人坚信我们的计划的现实性，并且明确地想像出应当以怎样的方针来发展世界各国人民之间的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫在全德工人代表会议上向瓦尔特·乌布利希致敬，因为他坚决维护工人阶级的利益，维护德国人民的利益。赫鲁晓夫说，如果奥托·格罗提渥领导整个德国的政府，那是不坏的，甚至是很好的。但是，如果西德人民现在对这一点还没有准备，那么不要着急，就让两个德国存在吧。两个德国应该展开和平竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在同资本主义的和平竞赛中，我们将以我们自己在社会主义建设事业中的各项成就来鼓舞工人和全世界劳动人民的头脑和心灵。在最近期间，我们将在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面超过最富强的资本主义国家，更加缩短工作日，在发展科学和文化方面将取得新的成就。到那时，资本主义国家的一切人们就会更加确信社会主义制度的优越性，并且自己决定：他们是否应该继续容忍他们那里的资本主义制度。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，当前我们大家最重要的任务是维护和平。和平力量不仅不弱于战争力量，而是比它强些。全世界的和平力量在日益增长，未来一定属于和平力量。维护和加强全世界工人阶级的团结一致对争取和平、反对战争的斗争具有特殊的意义。
