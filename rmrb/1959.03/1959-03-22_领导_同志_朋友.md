    Leader, Comrade, Friend
    Chen Tao
    Comrade Huang Ping, Secretary of the Nankang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province, spoke of his experience of going down to the countryside to be a commune member. He said that when he first arrived in the team, the men, women, old and young in the commune all called him Commissar Huang. After eating, living, and working together, a deep friendship was established between them. The commune members gradually changed from calling him Commissar Huang to Comrade Huang Ping, and finally simply called him Old Huang. Comrade Huang Ping said that he felt very happy every time he heard this title.
    Commissar Huang - Comrade Huang Ping - Old Huang, is this just a simple matter of title? This change in title reflects so vividly and figuratively the close relationship between a responsible cadre of the county and the commune members! What is especially wonderful is the word "simply"; "simply called him Old Huang," one can imagine the scene of them living together, working together, talking and laughing, without any restraint.
    Calling him "Commissar Huang," although also out of the masses' inner respect for the leader, always feels that the feelings are not so close. Calling him "Comrade Huang Ping" brings the feelings a step closer. As for simply calling him "Old Huang," then they have already become one, indicating that the masses have regarded our responsible cadres as ordinary laborers, as their friends, and the same as themselves.
    However, its significance is more than that.
    From "Commissar Huang" to "Comrade Huang Ping" to "Old Huang," this title reflects his triple identity - in the eyes of the masses, he is both a leader, a comrade, and a close friend. As an ordinary laborer, he is a member of the commune, working with the masses in production, a comrade of everyone; sharing hardships and joys with everyone, talking and laughing, knowing everything and saying everything, caring for each other, and also a close friend of the masses; as a responsible cadre, he not only participates in production, but also discovers problems, summarizes and promotes experience, and guides production, so he is also a leader of the masses.
    Leaders and the masses become one, integrated into the masses, listening to the voices of the masses, humbly learning skills from the masses, and then leading and educating the masses to advance together, united in their hearts to build socialism. This is a new style of leadership and a further development of our Party's mass line.
    As the saying goes: "A bird cannot fly without wings." If we compare all our people to a bird, then this bird is none other than a roc spreading its wings for thousands of miles. The body of the bird is naturally the masses, but the head of the bird is the leader. The combination of the leader and the masses can fly freely in the vast sky. Otherwise, it will be difficult to move an inch and at a loss. Cadres going down to the countryside as commune members, appearing as ordinary laborers, participating in production, and leading production, is precisely a good way to combine the two. This combination is for the purpose of soaring higher and achieving great success in the cause of building socialism. Therefore, our cadres, after combining with the masses, in addition to being close friends of the masses, must not forget to play the role of the "head."
    Because they are comrades and friends, it is easier to understand the situation and discover problems, and it is more convenient to do work. The implementation of policies and guidance of production will be more in line with reality. Because they are comrades and friends, sharing weal and woe with the masses, the enthusiasm of the masses for production will be even greater. The mobilization of the masses can be done more deeply and fully. This is actually strengthening the role of the "head." Therefore, the secretary being a commune member is precisely a good new way to strengthen leadership.
    This new relationship between cadres and the masses is worthy of poets writing poems to praise it, and singers singing loudly. This new relationship is not only universally true in the countryside, but also blossoms everywhere in the army and factories. Generals going down to companies as soldiers, generals and soldiers, are comrades, friends and leaders; factory directors going down to workshops as workers, factory directors and workers are also comrades, friends and leaders. In this way, cadres and the masses, leaders and the led, are twisted into one rope, close and intimate, with their hearts linked together.
    "Two people with one heart, yellow earth becomes gold." Today, our cadres and the masses are of one heart, and 650 million people are of one heart - one heart to build socialism and communism. What could be more indestructible on our road forward!

    领导·同志·朋友
    陈涛
    中共江西省南康县委书记黄平同志谈他下放当社员的心得说，他刚到队里的时候，社里的男女老少都叫他黄政委，经过同吃、同住、同劳动以后，彼此间建立了深厚的感情，社员们由叫黄政委逐渐改叫黄平同志，最后干脆叫他老黄了。黄平同志说，每当听到这个称号时，心里都非常高兴。
    黄政委——黄平同志——老黄，这仅是一个简单的称呼问题么？这个称呼的变化，多么形象、多么生动地反映了一个县的负责干部和社员群众间的亲密关系啊！尤其妙的是这“干脆”二字；“干脆叫他老黄了”，人们可以想像得到他们在一起同生活，同劳动，说说笑笑，无拘无束的情景。
    叫“黄政委”，这虽也是出自群众内心的对领导的尊敬的称呼，但总觉得感情上还不那么亲切。叫“黄平同志”，感情就进了一层。至于干脆叫“老黄”，那就已经打成一片了，说明群众已经把我们的负责干部看成是普通的劳动者，看成自己的朋友，和自己一样了。
    然而，它的意义还不止此。
    由“黄政委”而“黄平同志”而“老黄”，这个称呼，反映了他的三重身份——在群众看来，他既是领导，又是同志，又是亲密的朋友。作为一个普通劳动者，他是社员，和群众一起搞生产，是大家的同志；和大伙儿在一起同艰苦，共欢乐，说说笑笑，知无不言，彼此关心，又是群众亲密的朋友；作为一个负责干部，他不仅参加生产，还要发现问题，总结和推广经验，指导生产，这样，他又是群众的领导。
    领导和群众打成一片，融合在群众之中，倾听群众的心声，虚心向群众学习本领，而后又领导和教育群众，共同前进，万众一心为建设社会主义而奋斗。这是新的领导作风，是我们党的群众路线的进一步发扬。
    俗话说：“鸟无翅不飞”。如果把我们全体人民比作一只鸟，那么，这个鸟不是别的，而是一只展翅万里的大鹏，鸟的身体自然是群众，但鸟的头却是领导，领导和群众结合，就能海阔天空任飞翔。否则就会寸步难行，一筹莫展。干部下放当社员，以普通劳动者的身份出现，参加生产，领导生产，正是两者结合的好方法。这种结合，是为了更能展翅高飞，在建设社会主义的大业上鹏程万里，所以我们的干部在同群众结合之后，除了作群众的亲密的朋友之外，也还不能忘了起“头”的作用。
    因为是同志和朋友，了解情况、发现问题也就容易了，工作做起来也就方便了，贯彻政策和指导生产也就更切合实际了。因为是同志和朋友，与群众同甘苦，群众的生产劲头也就更大了。对群众的发动，也就能作得更深刻更充分。这实际上又是加强了“头”的作用。所以，书记当社员，正是加强领导的好方法新方法。
    这种干部和群众的新的关系，值得诗人们写诗赞美，歌手们放声歌唱。这种新的关系不仅在农村中普遍如此，而且在部队里，工厂中遍地开花。将军下连当兵，将军和士兵，是同志、朋友和领导的关系；厂长下到车间当工人，厂长和工人也是同志、朋友和领导的关系。就这样，干部和群众，领导和被领导，拧成了一条绳，亲密无间，心连着心。
    “两人一条心，黄土变成金”如今，我们的干部和群众是一条心，六亿五千万人民是一条心，——一条心建设社会主义和共产主义，在我们前进的道路上又何坚而不可摧呢！
