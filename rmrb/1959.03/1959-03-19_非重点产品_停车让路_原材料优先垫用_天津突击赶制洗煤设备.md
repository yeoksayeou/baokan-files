According to the Tianjin Daily, a campaign to rush-produce coal washing equipment is in full swing in Tianjin's mechanical and electrical factories. Workers from ten units, including the Belt Conveyor Factory, participating in this campaign, are placing the task of supporting steel production in a position of paramount importance, in accordance with the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," ensuring not a minute is wasted and resolutely completing the task on schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity.

The coal washing equipment assigned by the state this time includes belt conveyors, water pumps, hand-cranked winches, hydrocyclones, etc. These pieces of equipment are the main equipment urgently needed in coal washing at present, and the state requires them to be completed in batches in March, April, and May. The task is heavy and the time is short. After receiving the task, the factories quickly mobilized and launched a crash campaign. After receiving the task of producing 192 coal washing belt conveyors of six types, the party committee secretary and factory director of the Belt Conveyor Factory immediately held an emergency meeting to deploy the work. In order to race against time, special personnel were dispatched that same night to Beijing and Anshan to request drawings and expedite the supply of materials. The entire factory gave the green light to coal washing equipment, and all non-priority products that affected this task were temporarily suspended to make way for coal washing equipment. In order to ensure that coal washing equipment was put into production in a timely manner, before the state allocated materials arrived, five pieces of equipment being produced, such as horizontal lathes and combined shearing and punching machines, were stopped, and some of the raw materials were used first. Now, 360 large rollers and more than 50,000 circle pads and 15 other types of parts have been put into production.

Many factories have educated workers about "the whole country as a single chessboard," explained the role of coal washing equipment in steel production, educated workers to strengthen their overall perspective, actively overcome difficulties, and resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the state. A technical revolution upsurge to complete the coal washing equipment has been set off in various factories. The Winch Factory undertook the production of 40 hand-cranked winches of 500 kilograms, and the workers proposed to complete them by April 15, half a month earlier than required by the state. The lathe workshop proposed six measures, including using multi-tool and multi-blade to make turbine housings and turbine shafts, and using double-edged milling cutters to process oil plugs, to ensure that the processing task is completed 25 days ahead of schedule. When Water Pump Factory No. 2 was manufacturing water pumps, the poor quality of pig iron and the hardness of the castings caused some difficulties for processing. However, the workers said: although the iron is hard, our will is harder, we must complete the processing of the water pumps so that we can add provisions for the steel commander. Thanks to the joint efforts of leading cadres and workers, giving full play to their energy, working hard and skillfully, in addition to completing the production task for March, the 44 water pumps for April can also be delivered ahead of schedule by the end of March.

    非重点产品“停车让路”原材料优先垫用
    天津突击赶制洗煤设备
    据天津日报消息　一场赶制洗煤设备的突击战，正在天津市机电工厂中热烈展开。参加这场突击战的皮带运输机厂等十个单位的职工，根据“全国一盘棋”的方针，把承担这批支援钢铁生产的任务放在头等重要的地位，保证一分钟也不耽误，坚决保质保量按期完成。
    这次国家下达的洗煤设备，有皮带运输机、水泵、手摇卷扬机、水力旋流器等。这几项设备是目前洗煤中急迫需要的主要设备，国家要求分批在3、4、5月完成，任务重，时间短。各厂接到任务后，纷纷紧急动员起来，展开了突击大战。皮带运输机厂接到六种、一百九十二台洗煤皮带运输机的生产任务后，党委书记、厂长马上召开紧急会议进行部署。为了争分秒，抢时间，当天晚上就派出专人，连夜分赴北京、鞍山索图催料。全厂为洗煤设备大开“绿灯”，凡是影响这项任务的非重点产品，都暂时停止生产，为洗煤设备让路。为了保证洗煤设备及时投料，在国家拨料未到之前，正在生产的落地车床、联合剪冲机等五项设备停了下来，腾出一部分原材料先垫上。现在已有三百六十个大滚筒和五万多个圈垫等十五种零件投入生产。
    许多工厂向职工进行了“全国一盘棋”的教育，讲解洗煤设备在钢铁生产中的作用，教育职工加强全局观点，积极克服困难，坚决完成国家交给的任务。一个为完成洗煤设备的技术革命热潮在各厂掀起来了。卷扬机厂承担四十台五百公斤的手摇卷扬机，职工们提出要在4月15日比国家要求早半个月完成。车工车间提出了用多刀多刃制作涡轮箱和涡轮轴、双刃铣刀、加工油塞等六项措施，保证提前二十五天完成加工任务。水泵二厂在制造水泵时，由于生铁质量较差，铸件较硬，给加工带来了一些困难。但是职工们说：铁硬没有意志硬，一定要完成水泵加工任务，好给钢帅增加粮草。由于领导干部和工人上下一齐动手，鼓足干劲、实干巧干，这个厂除完成3月份的生产任务外，4月份的四十四台水泵，也可以在3月底提前交货。
