Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: “They can do anything, and they can do anything well.” These two sentences most aptly summarize the image of women in China today, and they are also the two sentences that all Chinese women are most proud of. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, and particularly since the realization of the people's commune system has opened up infinitely broad avenues for women in both urban and rural areas to participate in social labor, women have not only shown their talents in agricultural production, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and various service industries, but have also made significant contributions to various industrial production and construction efforts. The number of female workers in many large factories and mines has greatly increased compared to the past. For example, the number of female workers at Anshan Iron and Steel is now more than double what it was in 1956. Female workers at the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory now account for 18% of the factory's total workforce. Many production departments where women rarely or never participated in the past now have many women participating. For example, the Jiawang Coal Mine in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, did not have a single female worker before liberation, but now has 1,746 female workers who are responsible for design, production management, and driving locomotives. Yinchuan City, Ningxia, had only 19 female construction workers in 1956, but now has more than 2,000. During the nationwide steelmaking campaign, women were eager to be first and show their abilities.

Women's enthusiasm for participating in industrial production is so high that even without factory buildings, machines, or funds, they are trying every means to start various small factories from scratch and produce all kinds of industrial products. According to preliminary statistics from 22 cities including Beijing and Tianjin, 530,000 street women have left their homes to participate in industrial production. They have established more than 40,000 small factories, producing various products such as ball bearings, pesticides, and native fertilizers for agricultural production, as well as mechanical hardware, chemical industry raw materials, textiles, food, and medicine for large-scale industrial production and people's lives. According to preliminary estimates from the latter half of last year, more than 4,000 production units in Tianjin, mainly composed of street women, created approximately more than 20 million yuan worth of wealth for the country. The more than 32,000 street women in Changchun who participated in industrial production produced a total of 1,390 kinds of products and successfully trial-produced 320 new products within half a year.

The vast number of female workers are not only working with great enthusiasm in production, but are also actively participating in the technical innovation movement, and many advanced producers and female experts have emerged. In Shanghai's textile factories alone, female workers carried out more than 2,400 technical innovations in the latter half of last year. After a wave of learning from and catching up with experts was launched among the city's female fine spinning machine operators, 30% of the female spinners are now able to join 18 yarn ends per minute, reaching the expert level. More than 7,000 female advanced producers and advanced workers emerged in Shandong Province last year. Qu Shuzi, a female lathe operator at the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, reformed seven tools successively, increasing work efficiency by an average of 72 times, and completed the annual workload in five months and three days. Wei Fengying, a female worker at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory in Shenyang, has completed a total of 95 technical innovations in the past five years. One of the tools she reformed last year could increase production efficiency by 14 times, and she completed the workload for the second five-year plan in four months. Yang Shouyi, a female worker at the North China Radio Equipment Factory in Beijing, improved the glaze spraying operation method, increasing production efficiency by 256 times. Female technicians and male workers at the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory worked together for three months to solve the automation and dust removal problems of the "115" type sand mixer, increasing the sand mixing speed by eight times.

    在工业生产建设中作出重要贡献
    新中国妇女真能干
    新华社5日讯　“什么事情都能干，什么事情都能干得好”，这是概括今天中国妇女形象的最恰当的两句话，也是全中国妇女最引为骄傲的两句话。自从去年大跃进以来，由于人民公社化实现以后给广大城乡妇女参加社会劳动开辟了无限广阔的道路，妇女们不仅在农业生产、文教卫生事业以及各种服务性行业等方面大显了身手，而且在各种工业生产建设方面，也作出了重大贡献。许多大型厂矿企业里的女职工比过去大大增加了，如目前鞍钢的女职工已比1956年增加了一倍多；长春第一汽车厂的女职工已占这个厂职工总数的18％。过去很少或没有妇女参加的生产部门，现在也有不少妇女参加了，如江苏省徐州市贾汪煤矿解放前没有一个女工，现在已有一千七百四十六名女职工分别担任着设计、生产管理、开机车等工作。宁夏银川市1956年只有十九名女建筑工人，现在有了两千多名。在全民大炼钢铁运动中，妇女们更是人人争先，个个显能。
    妇女参加工业生产的热情是如此高涨，以至虽然没有厂房，没有机器，没有资金，她们也想尽各种办法，白手起家办起各种各样的小工厂，生产出了各种各样的工业产品。据北京、天津等二十二个城市的初步统计，有五十三万街道妇女走出家庭参加工业生产，她们办起的各种小工厂达四万多个，生产出来的产品有为农业生产服务的滚珠轴承、农药、土化肥，也有为大工业生产和人民生活服务的机械五金、化学工业原料、纺织品、食品、药物等。天津市四千多个主要由街道妇女组成的生产单位，据去年下半年初步估算，就大约为国家创造了价值两千多万元的财富。长春市参加工业生产的三万二千多名街道妇女，半年内共生产出一千三百九十种产品，并且试制成功了三百二十种新产品。
    广大女职工不仅在生产中干劲冲天，而且积极参加技术革新运动，涌现出了许多先进生产者和女能手。仅上海市各纺织工厂的女工，去年下半年就进行了二千四百多项技术革新。在全市细纱挡车女工中掀起学能手、赶能手的热潮后，现在已有30％的女车工，能够每分钟接头十八根，达到了能手水平。山东省去年一年涌现的女先进生产者和先进工作者达七千多名。济南市第二机床厂女车工曲淑姿，先后改革了七种工具，平均提高工效七十二倍，用五个月零三天的时间就完成了全年的工作量。沈阳东北机器制造厂女工蔚凤英，五年来共完成了九十五项技术革新，去年她改革的一项工具，可以提高生产效率十四倍，四个月时间就完成了第二个五年计划的工作量。北京华北无线电器材厂女工杨守仪，改进喷釉操作方法，提高生产效率达二百五十六倍。长春第一汽车厂女技术员和男职工们在一起，经过三个月苦战，解决了“一一五”型碾砂机的自动化和除尘问题，使碾砂速度提高了八倍。（附图片）
