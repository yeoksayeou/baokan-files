    Wild Plants—An Inexhaustible Treasure
    China’s wild plant resources are extremely abundant. More than a thousand kinds of wild plant materials have now been discovered that can be utilized. Among them are raw materials of wild plant fibers that can be used for papermaking, processing "artificial cotton," and replacing hemp; starch raw materials that can be used for oil extraction, brewing, starch extraction, and food processing; raw materials for manufacturing tannin extracts; and wild plant aromatic oil raw materials for extracting various essential oils and fragrances. In addition, there are many Chinese medicinal materials and indigenous pesticide raw materials. During the surveys, many wild plants with high economic value were also discovered in various places. For example, Baoshan County in Yunnan Province discovered about three million "fire bean trees" that can produce glucose and vitamins. In the past, this kind of bean was mostly imported from foreign countries. In Menglong and Mengbang and other places in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, a natural oil-producing tree called "Jiebuluo Xiang" was discovered. This tree has leaves as large as palms, and its trunk has fluff. If you dig a hole in the trunk and burn it with fire, oil will flow out. This oil can be used for lighting lamps, and when applied to books, it can prevent insect and ant bites. Rucheng County in Hunan Province discovered a tree that bears beans, grows fast, and has a high yield. It can bear fruit in the same year, and the beans can be used to make tofu, bean cakes, and can be stir-fried or boiled for consumption.
    Last year, the collection and utilization of wild plant materials across the country achieved great results. According to the statistics of the recent National Native Produce and Waste Products Conference, the country purchased more than 20 million dan of various wild plant materials last year, worth more than 150 million yuan, an increase of more than three times compared with 1957. The collection and utilization of these wild plants not only played a certain role in solving the shortage of certain industrial raw materials in the country, but also increased people's income and promoted the development of diversified operations in the people's communes.
    In the past year, various places have also created many advanced experiences in the utilization of wild plants. Santai County in Sichuan Province used wild plant fibers to process and manufacture "artificial cotton," which was spun into yarn and woven into cloth. It has now been promoted nationwide. In Sichuan and Yunnan provinces alone, 180,000 dan of "artificial cotton" were processed last year, which is equivalent to the output of approximately 180,000 mu of cotton fields. Last year, Xunwu County in Jiangxi Province purchased more than 3.9 million jin of wild plant oilseeds alone, which can produce about 500,000 jin of oil. Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang and other provinces used wild plant tannin raw materials to make tannin extracts, which replaced imported materials and supplied the needs of leather making and fishery production.
    In short, wild plants are everywhere, covering the mountains and plains. They are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. As long as we seize the production and collection season and organize the communes and members to collect them, we can increase a huge amount of wealth for the country.

    野生植物——取之不尽的财宝
    我国野生植物的资源非常丰富。就现在已发现的可以利用的各种野生植物原料共有一千多种，其中有可供造纸、加工“人造棉”和代替麻类使用的野生植物纤维的原料；有可供榨油、酿酒、提制淀粉、加工食品的淀粉原料；可供制造栲胶的原料，还有可供提制各种香精、香料的野生植物芳香油原料。此外，还有许多中药材和土农药原料。在调查中，各地还发现了许多具有很高的经济价值的野生植物，如云南省保山县发现了一种能制葡萄糖和维他命的“火豆树”约三百万棵，这种豆过去多从国外进口。云南省西双版纳的猛笼和猛棒等地，发现了一种天然出油的油树，名叫“羯布罗香”，这种树叶大如手掌，树干上有茸毛，在树干上挖一个洞，用火一烧，便流出油来。这种油可以点灯，涂在书籍上可以防虫蛀和蚂蚁咬。湖南省汝城县发现一种结豆子的树，生长快、产量高，当年就能结果，结的豆子可以用来做豆腐、豆糕和炒煮食用。
    去年，全国野生植物原料的采集和利用成绩很大。据最近召开的全国土产废品会议统计，去年全国收购的各种野生植物原料约有两千多万担，价值一亿五千多万元，比1957年增加三倍多。这些野生植物的采集和利用，不仅对解决国家某些工业原料不足问题起了一定的作用，而且增加了人民的收入，促进了人民公社多种经营的发展。
    一年来，在野生植物的利用上，各地也创造了不少先进经验。四川省三台县利用野生植物纤维加工制成了“人造棉”，纺成纱，织成布，现已在全国推广，仅四川、云南两省去年加工的“人造棉”就有十八万担，约相当于十八万亩棉田的产量。江西省寻乌县去年仅野生植物油料就收购了三百九十多万斤，可产油五十万斤左右。四川、贵州、浙江等省利用野生植物栲胶原料制成了栲胶，代替了进口物资，供应了制革和渔业生产的需要。
    总之，野生植物满山遍野到处都有，是取之不尽，用之不竭的，只要抓紧生产和采集季节，组织公社和社员采集起来，就可以为国家增加一笔巨大财富。
