People Sing, Oxen Rejoice, Spring Plowing Begins

(Our newspaper, Nanning, 4th dispatch) A high tide of spring plowing production competition has formed in Luchuan County.

This competition centers on thoroughly implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and carrying out large-scale, high-yield production. Since launching a large-scale manure accumulation campaign, the entire county has conducted three major inspections and appraisals, combined with general line propaganda and education, which has greatly promoted the spring plowing production movement throughout the county. For example, Qinghu Commune accumulated an average of more than 300 dan of fertilizer per mu per day, and Gucheng Work Area burned more than 10,000 dan of grass and wood ash per day. After learning about this, the rival Liangtian Commune immediately convened a commune-wide broadcast meeting, mobilizing commune members to learn from Qinghu and catch up with Qinghu. After the meeting, the entire commune universally smoked the soil, realizing the "fertilizer vat at the field head." The Fifth Production Team and the Sixth Production Team of the Qiaolu Work Area of ​​Michang Commune competed. During the first appraisal, the Fifth Team plowed more land, and the Sixth Team was judged to have lost due to the lack of male labor. The Chinese Communist Party branch of the Sixth Production Team immediately trained women to learn how to plow with oxen. The next day, nineteen women joined the plowing battle, catching up with and surpassing the Fifth Team.

In the process of the competition, both sides not only strived to be advanced and seize the upstream position but also supported each other and jointly leaped forward. For example, the Wanzhang Work Area and the Guantian Work Area of Shangyou Commune shared a river. During the competition, the Wanzhang Work Area, upstream of the river, took the initiative to let the Guantian Work Area downstream irrigate and plow the fields first, and then built dams to block the water and irrigate its own fields, so that the entire commune could have timely water for irrigation. Through segment-by-segment inspections and appraisals, the spirit of competing for diligence and striving for upstream positions has been continuously promoted, generating a huge driving force, and making the spring plowing production competition rapidly form a high tide. In this mass movement, the work style of cadres throughout the county has become more in-depth, meticulous, and down-to-earth. Now, the fields throughout the county are full of spring, people sing, oxen rejoice, and full-scale rice transplanting is about to begin. (Huang Shaojin)

    人唱牛欢开始春耕
    本报南宁4日电　陆川县的春耕生产竞赛形成高潮。
    这个竞赛是以贯彻执行
  “八字宪法”，开展大面积高额丰产为中心内容。从大搞积肥运动以来，全县进行了三次大检查、大评比，并结合进行总路线的宣传教育，大大推动了全县的春耕生产运动。如清湖公社一天积肥每亩平均达三百多担，古成工区一天烧草木灰一万多担。竞赛的对手良田公社知道以后，马上召开了公社广播大会，动员社员学习清湖、赶上清湖，会后全公社普遍进行了熏土，实现了田头肥缸化。米场公社桥鲁工区第五生产队与第六生产队竞赛，第一次评比时，五队耙田多，六队因男劳动力少，评输了。第六生产队的中共支部马上训练妇女学会用牛耙田，第二天十九个妇女耙田参战、追上并超过了五队。
    在竞赛过程中，双方不仅争先进、抢上游，而且互相支援，共同跃进。例如上游公社万丈工区与官田工区共用一条河水，在竞赛中，河水上游的万丈工区，主动地先让下游的官田工区灌水耙田，然后自己再筑坝拦水灌田，使整个公社都能及时有水灌田。通过逐段检查评比，比干劲、争上游的思想不断发扬光大，产生出巨大的推动力，使春耕生产大竞赛迅速形成高潮。在这个群众运动中，全县的干部作风更加深入、细致、踏实。现在，全县田野一片春意，人唱牛欢，全面插秧即将开始。　（黄绍进）
