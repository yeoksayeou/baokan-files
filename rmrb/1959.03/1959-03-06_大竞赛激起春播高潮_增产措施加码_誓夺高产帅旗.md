    Great Competition Spurs Spring Planting High Tide
    Increased Production Measures Added Vow to Seize the High-Yield Banner
    Guangzhou, March 5th (by our reporter) - In most rural areas of Guangdong Province, a red flag competition movement to seize a double-thousand jin per mu yield of early rice has been launched.
    This competition movement was launched on the ideological basis of summarizing the experience of last year's late-season production, speaking greatly of the harvest, speaking greatly of the achievements, and speaking greatly of the prospects. At present, more than twenty counties and cities, including Nanhai, Fan-Shun (Panyu and Shunde counties), Zengcheng, Hua County, and Zhongshan County in the Foshan Special District, Wengyuan, Lianping, and Longchuan in the Shaoguan Special District, as well as the suburbs of Shaoguan City, have raised their battle flags and launched competitions or leagues between counties and cities. The competition and comparison movement between management areas and management areas, production teams and production teams, and individuals and individuals has also spread to most areas. Zhongshan County has 140 management areas that have found their competition opponents; more than 780 of the more than 1,000 production teams in Nanhai County have challenged each other; 270 management areas and more than 1,600 production teams in 18 communes in Jieyang County are divided into four war zones for competition, and 570,000 laborers in the county have also found their opponents, youth against youth, women against women, and old farmers against old farmers. The four county party secretaries in charge of agriculture in this county each contracted a war zone and also participated in the competition.
    In areas where the movement has developed extensively and deeply, the backward elements among the masses have been motivated. Two members of the Lunjiao Commune in Fan-Shun County, who had previously attended work less often, greatly increased their labor enthusiasm after signing battle agreements with each other. Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law also compared themselves to see who was more advanced. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 40,000 people in Huiyang County alone participated in individual competitions.
    Striving for a double-thousand jin per mu yield of early rice has become the common goal of both sides in the county and commune competitions (some are higher than this target). The competition targets of each unit have been discussed by the masses, and specific advanced measures have been proposed. The target that Wengyuan County proposed to the brother counties in the competition was an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu on 200,000 mu of basic farmland in the county, and it also formulated three major measures: putting politics in command, following the mass line, and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, as well as specific details for implementing these measures. The Dawang Commune in this county also stipulated the quantity and quality of fertilizer application per mu, the time for delivering fertilizer, soaking seeds, sowing, transplanting, and the specifications for close planting in the conditions for proposing the challenge. 90% of the cadres in Fan-Shun County proposed the "two guarantees" of ensuring the mobilization of commune members and ensuring the implementation of specifications and quality, and the "five togethers" of working in the fields, living in the fields, eating in the fields, working in the fields, and conducting propaganda and education in the fields; the agronomists in this county also proposed the "five no's" competition centered on protecting seedlings: no drought, no waterlogging, no insect damage, no rat damage, and no missing seedlings. The content of the competition between production teams and production teams, and between individuals and individuals, generally revolves around completing the current production tasks of the commune.
    In areas where the competition has been widely carried out, the appearance of production has been changing day by day. As of the 20th of last month, the Foshan Special District had accumulated 10.4 billion dan of fertilizer, more than double the amount in the same period last year. Dongshan Commune, the most backward commune in fertilizer accumulation in Lianping County, recently accumulated more fertilizer in seven days than it had accumulated since the start of preparations for planting, after competing with the Zhongxin and Dahu communes, with 15 commune cadres leading more than 2,500 commune members to set up camps on the mountains. In the competition, major tool reforms are being carried out in order to defeat opponents through skillful work.
    Before and after the launch of this competition movement, all localities have conducted ideological education in the communist style for cadres and the masses, advocating the spirit of mutual assistance and common progress; some areas, in order to keep this socialist red flag competition movement hot and steaming from beginning to end, and to conduct competitions in a led and planned manner according to different production contents in different periods, have taken measures to strengthen leadership. For example, some counties have established special competition evaluation committees. Various competition experiences that were effective last year, such as holding mass competition mobilization meetings, signing contracts, setting up competition platforms, conducting regular evaluations and inspections, and using big-character posters and inserting red flags, have all been fully utilized.

### 大竞赛激起春播高潮  增产措施加码  誓夺高产帅旗

    大竞赛激起春播高潮
    增产措施加码  誓夺高产帅旗
    本报广州5日电　广东省大部分农村展开了夺取早稻亩产双千斤的红旗竞赛运动。
    这次竞赛运动，是在总结去年晚造生产经验，大谈丰收、大谈成绩、大谈远景的思想基础上掀起来的。目前，佛山专区的南海、番顺（番禺、顺德县）、增城、花县、中山县，韶关专区的翁源、连平、龙川以及韶关市郊区等二十多个县市，已经高举战旗，开展了县、市之间的对赛或联赛。管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队、个人与个人的竞赛评比运动，也遍及大部地区。中山县已有一百四十个管理区互相找好竞赛对手；南海县的一千多个生产队中，已有七百八十多个生产队互相挑战；揭阳县十八个公社的二百七十个管理区、一千六百多个生产队，分成四个战区展开竞赛，全县的五十七万个劳动力也各找对手，青年对青年，妇女对妇女，老农对老农。这个县专管农业的四位县委书记分别包干一个战区，也参加了竞赛行列。
    运动在广泛深入发展的地区，群众中的落后层已被带动起来。番顺县伦教公社有两个社员过去出勤较少，互相下了战表后，劳动积极性大大提高。夫妻、父子、婆媳之间也互比先进。据不完全的统计，仅惠阳县就有近四万人参加个人竞赛。
    力争早稻亩产双千斤，变成这次县、公社竞赛双方的一致目标（有的高于这个指标），各单位的竞赛指标，都经过群众讨论，并提出具体的先进措施。翁源县向兄弟县提出竞赛的指标是全县二十万亩基本农田平均亩产三千斤，并且订出了政治挂帅、群众路线、“八字宪法”的三大措施，以及实现这些措施的具体细节。这个县的大湾公社在提出挑战的条件中还规定了每亩下肥数量、质量、送肥、浸种、播种、插秧的时间，以及密植规格等。番顺县90％干部提出包发动社员、包执行规格质量的“二包”和劳动到田、住到田、食到田、办公到田、宣传教育到田的“五到”；这个县的农艺师之间，也提出了以保苗为中心的无旱、无水浸、无虫吃、无鼠患、无缺苗的“五无”竞赛。生产队与生产队、个人与个人的竞赛内容，一般都围绕了完成公社的当前生产任务。
    在已经广泛开展竞赛的地区，生产面貌已日新月异。佛山专区到上月20日止，全区已积肥一百零四亿担，比去年同期增加两倍多。连平县积肥最落后的东山公社，最近和忠信、大湖两个公社竞赛后，十五个社干部带动了二千五百多个社员上山安营扎寨，七天时间积得的肥料比备耕以来所积的还多。在竞赛中，大搞工具改革，以便通过巧干来战胜对手。
    这次竞赛运动开展前后，各地都向干部和群众进行了共产主义风格的思想教育，提倡互相帮助、共同跃进的精神；有些地区为了使这个社会主义红旗竞赛运动自始至终保持热气腾腾，有领导、有计划地按不同时期不同生产内容进行竞赛，已采取措施加强领导。例如有些县专门成立了竞赛评比委员会。去年行之有效的如举行群众竞赛誓师大会、签订合同、摆竞赛擂台、定期评比检查、大字报、插红旗等各种竞赛经验都充分地加以运用。　（许实）
