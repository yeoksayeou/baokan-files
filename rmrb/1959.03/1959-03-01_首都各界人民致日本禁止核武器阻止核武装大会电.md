Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The message from people of all circles in the capital supporting the Japanese people's struggle to ban nuclear weapons and oppose nuclear armament to the "Fifth Anniversary of the Bikini Victims, Ban Nuclear Weapons, and Prevent Japanese Nuclear Armament Conference" in Japan is as follows:

To the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, transferred to the Bikini Victims Fifth Anniversary, Ban Nuclear Weapons, Prevent Japanese Nuclear Armament Conference:

    On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Japanese people's suffering from the American hydrogen bomb test disaster, people from all walks of life in the capital of the People's Republic of China solemnly gather to support the Japanese people's just struggle to ban nuclear weapons and oppose Japanese nuclear armament. We express our deep condolences to the Japanese people who were innocently sacrificed by the atomic bombing and hydrogen bomb tests of US imperialism, and extend our heartfelt condolences to their families and the victims who are still suffering from atomic diseases. We also express our sincere respect to the Japanese people who are resolutely fighting to ban nuclear weapons, oppose Japanese nuclear armament, and oppose the US imperialism's policy of promoting nuclear war threats.

    Banning nuclear weapons and opposing the entry of nuclear weapons into Japan is the urgent demand of the Japanese people and is in line with the interests of defending peace in Asia and the world; however, the aggressive US imperialism not only does not stop their nuclear tests, obstructs the agreement on the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear tests at the Geneva Conference on the Prohibition of Nuclear Tests, and further colludes with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, which has potential imperialist ambitions, attempting to amend the US-Japan "Security Treaty," step up the armament of Japan with nuclear weapons, turn Japan into a permanent US base in the Far East, and drag Japan into a nuclear war to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. The Japanese people, who have suffered from the scourge of war and atomic disasters, resolutely oppose this war conspiracy by the US-Japanese reactionaries, launching a large-scale struggle demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, opposing Japanese nuclear armament, demanding the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and the realization of an independent, democratic, and peaceful neutral Japan. The just demands of the Japanese people will receive the unanimous support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world.

    The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people. We solemnly condemn the war conspiracy activities of US imperialism and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government that threaten peace in Asia and the world. We fully support the proposal put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to establish peace zones in the Far East and the entire Pacific region, first of all, to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones. In the Japanese people's struggle against the conspiracy of aggressive war and for independence, peace, and democracy, the Chinese people will always be the close friends of the Japanese people. We firmly believe that in today's world where the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the forces of peace prevail over the forces of war, the struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

    首都各界人民致日本禁止核武器阻止核武装大会电
    新华社28日讯　首都各界人民支持日本人民禁止核武器、反对日本核武装斗争大会给日本“比基尼受害五周年、禁止核武器、阻止日本核武装大会”的电报，全文如下：日本禁止原子弹、氢弹协议会转比基尼受害五周年、禁止核武器、
  阻止日本核武装大会：
    值此日本人民遭受美国氢弹试验灾害五周年前夕，中华人民共和国首都各界人民庄严集会，支持日本人民禁止核武器、反对日本核武装的正义斗争。我们对因美帝国主义的原子轰炸和氢弹试验而无辜牺牲的日本人民表示沉痛的哀悼，对他们的遗属和仍在遭受原子病症痛苦的受害者遥致亲切的慰问。并向为禁止核武器、为反对日本核武装和反对美帝国主义推行核战争威胁政策而坚决斗争的日本人民致以衷心的敬意。
    禁止核武器、反对把核武器运进日本，是日本人民的迫切要求，也符合保卫亚洲和世界和平的利益；但是，侵略成性的美帝国主义不仅不停止他们的核试验，阻挠在日内瓦的禁止核试验会议上就立即和永远停止核试验问题达成协议，并且更进一步同具有潜在帝国主义野心的日本岸信介政府狼狈为奸，企图通过修改日美“安全条约”，加紧用核武器武装日本，把日本变为美国在远东的永久基地，并把日本拖入为美国火中取栗的核武器战争。饱受战争祸害和原子灾难的日本人民，坚决反对美日反动派的这一战争阴谋，展开了声势浩大的斗争，要求禁止核武器、反对日本核武装，要求废除日美“安全条约”和实现一个独立、民主与和平中立的日本。日本人民的正义要求，将会得到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的一致支持。
    中国人民坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。我们严正谴责美帝国主义和日本岸信介政府威胁亚洲和世界和平的战争阴谋活动。我们完全支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫所提出的在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平地区，首先是建立无原子武器地区的建议。在日本人民反对侵略战争阴谋和争取独立、和平、民主的斗争中，中国人民永远是日本人民的亲密朋友。我们坚信，在东风压倒西风，和平力量压倒战争势力的今天，日本人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。中华人民共和国首都各界
