    "Pan-Yang Harmony"
    —The Story of the Transformation from "Rancor" to "Harmony" Between the Pan and Yang Clans of Yantou Village

    In March, in the area beyond the Great Wall, we visited an ancient village – Yantou Village, Datong City. Here, we heard a vivid story of the transition from "Pan-Yang Rancor" to "Pan-Yang Harmony." This story ruthlessly uprooted the seeds of discord sown among the people by the feudal rulers for thousands of years, and enthusiastically praised the communist ethos that has grown since the communization of the people.
    Of the two hundred and some households in Yantou Village, the Pan and Yang surnames account for 80%. According to local folklore, they were all immigrants who moved from within Yanmen Pass nine hundred years ago. The Pan family is descended from Pan Renmei of the Song Dynasty, and the Yang family is descended from the Yang Generals. The mountains, thirty miles southwest of Yantou Village, where peaks overlap, are the Two Wolf Mountains, where Pan Renmei held back troops, leading to Yang Ye's entrapment and martyrdom. The Li Ling Stele, where Yang Ye died, is still preserved here. The boundless plains to the south, covered with trees, are the ancient battlefield of Jinshatan, where the Yang Generals fought fiercely with the foreign soldiers.
    According to the fictional stories, the Pan and Yang families had a "blood feud," but this was nine hundred years ago. Who could have imagined that this fictional story would sow the seeds of discord in a small village beyond the Great Wall.
    Nine Centuries Passed
    The struggle between the Pan and Yang families lasted for more than nine hundred years, and continued in Yantou Village until before liberation, becoming a tool for the landlord class to create divisions among the working people and maintain feudal rule.
    One year, Yantou invited a good opera troupe, and the Pan family landlords in power ordered the performance of "Jinshatan," in which the Yang Generals were defeated and killed. This play immediately aroused the resentment of the Yang families, and the Yang family landlords, seeing an opportunity, organized the Yang family to demand that the troupe perform "Suing the Emperor" that afternoon. The Pan family came forward to block them, resulting in a large-scale brawl, with broken heads and bloodshed, and no clear victor. So, they went to the county government to file a lawsuit. The muddle-headed county magistrate, of course, could not judge who was right and who was wrong, so he declared that the performance of "Jinshatan" and "Suing the Emperor" was forbidden in Yantou Village. From then on, plays about the Pan-Yang struggle became taboo here.
    The struggle between the two major clans in Yantou Village, centered on the interests of the feudal landlord class, became increasingly acute. During the Japanese invasion of China, around 1942, the village government of Yantou Village was seized by the landlord Yang Sixian, and a large number of conscription fees, opium taxes, white hemp, etc., were put into his pocket. At that time, the Pan landlords, led by landlord Pan Jinyuan, were envious, and organized the Pan people to jointly sue at the pseudo-Datong Court, and fought a lawsuit with Yang Sixian's group for half a year. The Pan family had money and finally defeated the Yang family and seized the village government. Under the manipulation of the feudal ruling class, the Pan and Yang families of Yantou Village added new hatred to old grudges, and the hatred became deeper and deeper. More than eighty Pan households and more than eighty Yang households in the village did not speak to each other when they met, their children did not marry, and even the children did not play together. Thus, the story of "Pan-Yang Rancor" was almost universally known within a hundred miles.
    The End of Factional Struggle
    The long-term factional struggle between the two major surnames in Yantou Village gradually subsided only after liberation.
    Yantou Village was liberated in 1947, and the land reform movement was launched in 1949. The village's poor peasant associations were established, and the poor and hired peasants, who had been deeply oppressed and exploited by the landlords and rich peasants, awakened under the education of the Party. Pan Ying and Pan Rixiang, who had been working as hired laborers for half their lives, broke the boundaries of their own surnames for the first time, and stood together with Yang Yingshan, Yang Yucai and other poor and hired peasants to launch a struggle against Pan Fu-hong, the largest landlord in the village. This land reform movement lasted for more than three months, and although two landlords surnamed Pan, one rich peasant surnamed Pan and two rich peasants surnamed Yang were overthrown. However, because a considerable number of people were still bound by feudal family concepts, the land reform was not thorough. From then on, although there were no more large-scale fights in Yantou Village, small-scale open and secret struggles between the Pan and Yang families continued. The Pans did not allow the Yangs to walk through their land or yards; the Yangs fabricated facts and jointly falsely accused the Pans. Such incidents were still common.
    According to the specific situation of Yantou, the Party branch launched a movement to fight feudalism in 1955. Because the peasants had been educated by the Party for nine years, and they had also seen through the means of the Pan and Yang landlords to create discord within the working people, they brought the four Pan landlords, one Yang landlord and one Yang rich peasant who had escaped the net or passed the test in 1949 to the light of day. Pan Yintang's nephew exposed his uncle's conspiracy to use the historical contradictions between the Pan and Yang families to divide the working people, completely digging out the hidden reefs that created discord between the two families, and giving all the people of the Pan and Yang families in the village the most vivid class education. In this struggle, the cooperation between the Pan and Yang families in Yantou Village made new progress. In the same year, the village's unified agricultural production cooperative was born. In an agricultural cooperative, everyone worked together in the same boat, greatly improving the relationship between people. However, it was not until after the communization that the Pan and Yang families were able to treat each other sincerely, and truly eliminate the rift ideologically.
    From Great Unity to Great Leap Forward
    In 1958, Yantou Village joined the Dongfeng People's Commune in the suburbs of Datong City. People not only worked together and harvested together, but also "ate from the same pot." After the foundations of the hatred between the Pan and Yang families were dug away, the ideological influence that controlled the minds of the Pan and Yang families lost its effectiveness. As a result, a brand-new relationship of unity and kindness was formed. Making friends and intermarrying between the Pan and Yang families became a new social custom in Yantou Village. Although our visit to Yantou Village was short, we heard many stories of "Pan-Yang Harmony."
    Pan Xian and Yang Nan were neighbors in front and behind the house. Both were young, but the "hatred" inherited from their ancestors had always dominated these two young men, making them the only pair of enemies left after the fight against feudalism in 1955. As late as 1957, Yang Nan's sister was beaten for walking through Pan Xian's yard. In the winter of 1957, Yantou Village launched a mass rectification campaign, and Yang Nan exposed Pan Xian's behavior of selling straw privately. At that time, Pan Xian was extremely dissatisfied, thinking that Yang Nan was retaliating. Later, after criticism from the members and several talks with the secretary of the Party branch, he felt that he was wrong and felt a little sorry. After the communization, the two young men slowly approached each other while working on a well on a construction site. They spoke their minds to each other and reconciled. Later, when working, Yang Nan would quickly replace Pan Xian when he saw that he was tired, and Pan Xian would let him rest and do the work himself when he saw that Yang Nan had been working for a long time. In this way, a pair of enemies became a pair of close comrades-in-arms.
    There were also two girls in the village, one named Yang Yingxian and the other named Pan Nvdan. They were the same age and had even studied in the same school when they were young. However, because the older generation did not communicate with each other, it also hindered the approach of these two girls. Last year, the communization was realized, and the gongs and drums of the Great Leap Forward in the village were deafening. Both girls wanted to find a partner for work and labor. The two of them chose each other, so they had a frank conversation and became one. When weeding in the summer, they jointly proposed a competition to the members. When they went to the ground, one helped the other as soon as one finished hoeing, inseparable, like sisters. Last year, when watering the fields, the flood was great and they could not seal the opening, so the two girls jumped into the water to block the opening together. Nvdan also discussed her marriage with Yingxian. In February of this year, Pan Nvdan got married, Yang Yingxian helped Pan Nvdan dress up, and sent her all the way outside the village before returning. The two girls became a model for the unity and leap forward of women in Yantou Village, and the slogan "Learn from Yang Yingxian and Pan Nvdan" became the goal of all women in the village.
    The young people of the Pan and Yang families reconciled, and the old people also changed greatly. Pan Gui and his wife died in 1957, leaving a boy unattended. The wife of Yang Hengshan adopted him and treated him even more dearly than her own son, giving the child the first priority for food, drink, clothing, and wearing. The villagers said, "Pan Changren (the name of the adopted son) has become Yang Hengshan's favorite son!" On the evening of the second day of our visit to Yantou, we also saw two old men playing chess in the twilight. We asked, and learned that one was named Pan Dianying and the other was named Yang Bei. We asked again, "Are you old chess friends?" They looked at each other and laughed.
    The reconciliation of the Pan and Yang families has brought a new situation to production in Yantou Village. In 1958, more than 700 people in the village joined forces to build water conservancy projects, so that Yantou, which had been planting dry land for generations, saw 200 mu of paddy fields for the first time. The battle for fertilizer and field management guaranteed a bumper harvest. Last year, the total grain output of the village reached more than 500,000 jin, with an average of more than 710 jin per person, an increase of more than 130,000 jin compared with 1957, and the yield per mu increased by 36% compared with 1957, ending the thousand-year history of low yield. Since the beginning of this year, the members of Yantou Village are working with greater efforts to realize the Party's call for a greater leap forward. They are determined to complete the garden-like construction of 400 mu of land and the target of applying 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of 2,000 mu of basic farmland in the three months before the end of spring plowing, and strive for a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu this year. The members of Yantou Village use such verses to praise the people's commune:
    "The people's commune shines brightly,
    A thousand years of grievances swept away,
    Pan and Yang unite in the Great Leap Forward,
    Each year is stronger than the last."

    “潘杨和”
    ——晏头村潘杨两姓由“怨”到“和”的故事
    高松　杨森　杨义　莎荫
    3月间，我们在外长城内的塞上地区，访问了一个古老的村庄——大同市晏头村。在这里，我们听到了一个生动的从“潘杨怨”到“潘杨和”的故事。这个故事无情地挖掉了千年来封建统治者播散在人民中间的不和的种子，热情洋溢地歌颂了人民公社化后成长起来的共产主义风尚。
    晏头村二百零几户人家，潘、杨两姓占了80％。根据当地群众传说，他们都是九百年以前从雁门关内迁来的移民。潘家是宋代潘仁美的后裔，杨家是杨家将的后代。晏头村西南方向三十里的群峰重叠的大山，就是当年潘仁美按兵不发致使杨业被困而殉难的两狼山，现在这里还保留着当时碰死杨业的李陵碑。南面一望无际的树木丛生的平川，就是民间相传杨家将与番兵大战的古战场——四十里金沙滩。
    根据演义故事，潘杨两家结下“血海深仇”，但这是九百年前的事了。谁能料想到，这件演义故事却给塞上一个小小村庄，播下了不和的种子。
    过了九个世纪
    潘、杨两家的斗争，经过了漫长的九百多年，直到解放以前，还在晏头村持续着，而且成了地主阶级用来制造劳动人民间裂痕、维持封建统治的手段。
    有一年，晏头请了一台好戏，当权的潘家地主就点了一个杨家将被杀得落花流水的“金沙滩”。这个戏立刻引起了杨姓人家的反感，杨姓地主见有机可乘，便组织杨家人马，立逼剧团在当天下午演出“告御状”，潘家出面阻挡，结果，造成了一场大规模的打群架事件，直打得头破血流，难分胜负，于是，又跑到县衙门里去打官司。昏庸的县官，当然无法判个谁是谁非，就胡里胡涂地宣告禁止晏头村上演“金沙滩”和“告御状”，从此有关潘、杨斗争的戏，在这里变成了禁戏。
    以封建地主阶级利益为中心的晏头村的两大宗族的斗争，在以后变得越来越尖锐了。日寇侵华期间，大约是1942年，晏头村的村政权被地主杨思贤夺去了，大批壮丁费、鸦片捐、白麻等都装进了腰包。当时，姓潘的地主看得眼红了，以地主潘金元为首，组织了潘姓的人，联名在伪大同法院告了状，和杨思贤聚集的一簇人打了半年官司。潘家有钱，最后把杨家告倒了，把村政权夺到了手。晏头村的潘、杨两姓就这样在封建统治阶级的操纵下，旧仇加新恨，仇恨越结越深。全村八十多家姓潘的和八十多家姓杨的见面不说话，儿女不结亲，甚至小孩也不在一起玩耍。于是“潘杨怨”的故事，在方圆百里之内，几乎无人不知。
    宗派斗争的平息
    晏头村两大姓之间长期的宗派斗争，直到解放以后才逐渐地平息。
    1947年晏头村解放，1949年便展开了土地改革运动。村里的贫农团成立了，那些深受地主、富农压榨剥削的贫雇农，在党的教育下觉醒了。半辈子扛长工的潘英、潘日祥第一次打破当家本姓的界线，和杨应山、杨玉才等贫雇农站在一起，向村里最大的地主潘辅洪展开了斗争。这次土地改革运动先后进行了三个多月，虽然斗倒了两个姓潘的地主，一户姓潘的富农和两户姓杨的富农。但是，由于仍然有相当一部分人被封建的家族观念束缚着，因而，就使得土地改革没有斗透。从此以后，晏头村虽然再没有发生大规模的斗殴，但潘、杨两姓之间小规模的明争暗斗还在继续着。姓潘的不许姓杨的从自己地里、院里走；姓杨的捏造事实，联名诬告姓潘的。这类事件，还是屡见不鲜。
    根据晏头的具体情况，党支部在1955年发动群众开展打封建运动。由于农民已经受了党的九年教育，对于潘、杨两姓地主制造劳动人民内部不和的手段也看清了，因而把在1949年漏网和混过关的四大潘姓地主、一个杨姓地主和一户杨姓富农拉到光天化日之下了。地主潘印堂的侄子揭发了他叔父利用潘、杨历史矛盾分裂劳动人民的阴谋，彻底挖掉了制造两姓不和的暗礁，使全村潘、杨两家的人受了一次最生动的阶级教育。在这次斗争中，晏头村潘、杨两姓的合作有了新的进展。就在这一年，全村统一的农业生产合作社诞生了。在一个农业社里，大家同舟共济，大大地改善了人与人之间的关系。但是，潘、杨两姓能够赤诚相见，以心相许，真正地从思想上消除裂痕，还是在公社化以后。
    从大团结到大跃进
    1958年，晏头村参加了大同市郊东风人民公社。人们不仅一起劳动，一起收获，而且“一个锅里搅饭吃”了。所有构成潘、杨两姓之间仇恨的基础被挖掉之后，左右潘、杨两姓人们的思想影响，便随之而失去了控制的效能。于是，一个崭新的团结、亲切的关系形成了。潘、杨两姓之间交朋友、结亲家，成为晏头村新的社会风尚。我们在晏头村访问时间虽短，却听到了许多“潘杨和”的故事。
    潘贤和杨南是房前房后的邻居。两人都很年轻，但是从祖先那里继承下来的“仇恨”一直支配着这两个年轻人，使他们成了1955年打封建以后留下的唯一的一对冤家了。就在1957年，杨南的妹妹因为走了潘贤的院子，还遭到一次痛打。1957年冬天，晏头村开展了全民大整风，杨南揭发了潘贤私卖谷草的行为，当时潘贤极为不满，认为杨南是报复。以后经过社员批评，党支部书记几次谈话，才感到自己不对，心里觉得有点抱歉。公社化以后，这两个年轻人在一个工地上打井，才慢慢接近起来。互相说了心里话，和解了。以后劳动时，杨南看见潘贤累了，就赶紧去替换，潘贤看到杨南劳动时间长了，就让他休息自己干，这样，一对冤家变成了一对亲密的战友。
    村里还有两个姑娘，一个叫杨英仙，一个叫潘女旦，两人同岁，小时候还在一个学校念过书。可是，因为老一辈们互不来往，也阻碍了这两个姑娘的接近。去年实现了公社化，村里大跃进的锣鼓敲得震天响，两个姑娘都想找一个工作、劳动的伙伴。两个人互相选中了，于是就开诚布公地谈了一次心，拧成一股劲。夏锄时，共同向社员们提出竞赛，上了地，一个锄到头，就帮助另一个，形影不离，活像亲姐妹。去年浇地时，洪水大，封不了口，两个姑娘就双双跳进水中堵口。女旦找对象还要和英仙商量。今年2月，潘女旦结婚，杨英仙帮潘女旦穿戴好，一直送到村外才回来。两个姑娘成了晏头村妇女团结跃进的榜样，“向杨英仙和潘女旦学习”的口号，成了全村妇女努力的目标。
    潘、杨两家的年轻人和好了，老年人也大变了。潘贵两口在1957年去世了，留下一个男孩无人抚养，杨恒山老汉的女人便收养起来，看得比自己的亲生子还亲，吃、喝、穿、戴先让给孩子。村里人们说：“潘长仁（收养子名）成了杨恒山的老疙瘩（爱称）了！”我们访问晏头的第二天晚上，还看见两个老汉在暮色苍茫中下棋，问了一下，知道一个叫潘殿英，一个叫杨北，我们又问：“你们是老棋友吧？”他们互相看了看，哈哈大笑了。
    潘、杨两姓的和解，给晏头村生产带来了一个新局面，1958年，全村七百多人拧成一股劲，大兴水利，使祖祖辈辈种旱田的晏头，第一次出现了二百亩水田。大战肥料和田间管理，保证了大丰收。去年全村粮食总产量达五十多万斤，每人平均粮食七百一十斤以上，总产量比1957年增加了十三万多斤，亩产量比1957年提高了36％，结束了千年的低产史。今年以来，晏头村社员们正以更大干劲实现党的更大跃进的号召，他们决心在春耕结束之前的三个月中，完成四百亩地的园田化工程，完成二千亩基本农田亩施肥十万斤的指标，力争今年亩产千斤粮。晏头社员们用这样的诗句歌颂人民公社：
    “人民公社放光芒，
    千年积怨一扫光，
    潘杨团结大跃进，
    一年要比一年强。”
                          （原载山西日报）
