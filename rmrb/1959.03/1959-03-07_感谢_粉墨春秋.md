Thanks to "The Painted Faces of Opera"
　　丘扬
　　Mr. Gai Jiaotian, with his lifelong artistic experience, has once again demonstrated to us younger generations that, as a science, the art of performance requires in-depth learning from life and persistent, arduous training.

　　This book, echoing Mr. Mei Lanfang's "Forty Years of Stage Life," has its own unique characteristics, which is to more broadly guide us to understand how the older generation of performing artists (especially the vast number of actors from the folk) lived and learned.

　　Many things are difficult for later generations to imagine, such as the extremely arduous life of learning the art; treating the difficult living environment as a condition for exploring art, and so on. (One can close one's eyes and imagine how the young Gai Jiaotian, in the rural dirt roads with snow up to his knees, braved the wind and snow, running and jumping to figure out the moving situation of the "Night Journey") From this, one can clearly understand why Gai Lao, whose "whiskers are like frost, but spirit is still like a dragon" (a line from Comrade Tian Han's poem to Gai Lao's Wu Song), still has agile skills and accurate and exquisite "unique skills" in his old age! Why would Gai Lao say with endless gratitude today, "My parents gave me life, and the Communist Party understands me!"

　　A performing artist who is loyal to his profession cannot but first be strictly loyal to life. How to verify, integrate, and sublimate the principles of life and the principles of artistic creation at any time and anywhere, Gai Lao provides us with many valuable instructions in his book, such as the stage positions and the relationship between actors and audiences from the layout of indoor furnishings ("a flip and a stand in tumbling exercises"), such as starting from strictly adhering to the logic of life first, and gradually entering the learning process of art education ("Someone answers before pushing the door"), etc. Gai Lao, from the time he stepped into the hall of art as a schoolboy until he created a complete image, has given many insightful, practical, and extremely meaningful inspirations at each important stage. And in all these inspirations, Gai Lao has pointed out more than once that an actor must be an honest, serious, and moral person in life and on the stage. Many descriptions that seem like details of life are actually chapters with deep intentions, which also prove that Gai Lao is worthy of being a model in this regard.

　　What is most commendable is that what Gai Lao depicts is a life that we can be familiar with and understand; what he summarizes are principles that we can comprehend and understand (and therefore can be applied to practice more quickly). National style should be an important feature of the book's style.

　　This is a performing textbook and actor's cultivation textbook worthy of repeated and careful reading and repeated deliberation. It is true not only for opera actors, but also for drama and film actors. Especially at present, when the issue of learning from the tradition of opera is raised more urgently, one will gain many beneficial and even urgently needed nourishment from this book.

　　This method of recording is also worth affirming. Although it has been organized, it basically preserves Gai Lao's language and spirit, without embellishment, without exaggeration, and without rigidly using a framework to summarize his many wonderful and vivid insights. Therefore, it is easier for readers to digest and chew from different angles and depths without deviating from Gai Lao's original intention. This should also be thanked to the two recorders.

    感谢“粉墨春秋”
    丘扬
    盖叫天先生以他毕生的学艺经历，再度向我们这些后辈昭示：做为一门科学，表演艺术需要的是深入地向生活学习，顽强地刻苦锻炼。
    这本和梅兰芳先生的“舞台生活四十年”前后辉映的经验谈，有其独具的特色，那就是更广泛地引领我们去了解，前辈的表演艺术家们（特别是为数众多的来自民间的演员）是如何生活过来、学习过来的。
    有许多事物是后人难于想像的，比如刻苦极了的学艺生活；把艰苦的生活环境当做自己探索艺术的条件等等。（一闭眼就可以想像得到幼年的盖叫天如何在雪深及膝的乡间土道上，迎着风雪，奔跑跳踉地揣摩“夜行边”身段的动人情境），由之，可以清楚地理解，何以“须眉如霜气犹龙”（田汉同志赠盖老武松诗的一句）的盖老，在暮年犹有矫健的身手，准确精湛的“绝活”！何以盖老会在今日感涕无已说出“生我者父母，知我者共产党！”
    一个忠于自己行业的表演艺术家，不可能不首先是严格地忠于生活的人，如何把生活的道理和艺术创造的道理随时随地地加以印证、加以揉合和加以升华，盖老在他的书中提供给我们许多宝贵的指教，比如从室内陈设的布局所联想起的舞台部位、演员与观众的交流关系，（“毯子功一戳一站”）比如从首先严格地忠实于生活逻辑出发，逐步进入艺术教育的学习过程；（“有人应声才推门”）等等，盖老从一个学童踏进艺术殿堂开始，直至他创造出完整形象为止的各个重要阶段，都给了许多深入浅出、实践意义极大的启示。而在这一切启示当中，盖老不止一次地指出，一个演员必须是生活中诚实、舞台上严肃的有道德的人。许多看来像是生活细节的描绘，其实却是具有深心安排的章节，也恰好证明盖老无愧于这方面的楷模。
    最值得称道的是：盖老所描绘的是我们可以熟知、可以理解的生活；所概括的是我们可以领悟、可以理解（因之是可以较快地用于实践）的道理。民族气派，该是全书风格的重要特色。
    这是一本值得反复精读、反复揣摩的表演教科书、演员修养教科书，不仅对于戏曲演员说来如是，对于话剧、电影演员说来亦莫不如是，特别在目前，当学习戏曲传统的问题提的更为迫切的时候，是会从这本书中得到许多有益的、甚至是急需的滋养的。
    这种记录的方法也是应该肯定的，虽然有过整理，但基本上保存着盖老的语句精神，不粉饰，不铺张，也没有呆板地用一个框框去归纳他许多精彩生动的见解。因之就更便于读者从不同的角度、不同的深度去消化咀嚼，而又不会与盖老的初衷乖离。这也是应当向两位记录者致谢的。
