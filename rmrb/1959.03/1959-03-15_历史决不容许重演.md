History Must Never Be Allowed to Repeat Itself
By Our Staff Commentator

March 15th is an unforgettable date in modern history. Twenty years ago today, Hitler's Germany, with the connivance of the British and French imperialists' shameful policy of appeasement, invaded and occupied the then-bourgeois independent state of Czechoslovakia. To remind world public opinion once again of this painful historical lesson, the Czechoslovak government recently issued a memorandum on the 20th anniversary of the German fascist occupation of Czechoslovakia. It calls on the anti-Hitler alliance countries, especially those that suffered from the aggression of fascist Germany, to cooperate in opposing and stopping the danger of the revival of German militarism, and to work for the maintenance of peace in Europe and the world.

The situation in Europe has undergone fundamental changes since the war. Czechoslovakia, which was at the mercy of others twenty years ago due to the weakness and incompetence of its bourgeois rulers, is today a prosperous and strong socialist country. The people of Czechoslovakia have become the masters of their own country. They are reliably defending their country's freedom and independence, and together with the people of the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union, are making important contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting the cause of human progress. Czechoslovakia suffered from Hitler's aggression, and its people played an indispensable role in the struggle to defeat fascist Germany. Therefore, Czechoslovakia has every right to participate in the settlement of the German question. Its call for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful settlement of the German question should be taken seriously by the world. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's proposal in its March 2nd reply to the Western countries, believing that the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the work of the East-West conference will help resolve the German question and European security issues.

The facts of twenty years ago have become history. But in Western countries today, there are still people walking the old path of twenty years ago. Those who once manufactured and started Hitler's German war machine, bringing great disasters to European countries, are now in key positions in the West German government and are eager to try to re-realize Hitler's aggressive dreams that have been shattered. And those new Chamberlains and Daladiers have also forgotten the lessons of history and want to use their patronage to cultivate West German militarist forces in order to achieve the goals they envisioned on the eve of World War II. All peace-loving countries and people must be highly vigilant about this.

However, history must never be allowed to repeat itself. The people of all countries cannot stand by and watch Germany, which has brought two bloody disasters to the world in just half a century, turn into a source of war to launch another large-scale massacre. They support the Soviet government's peace proposals, support the German Democratic Republic's peaceful and democratic policies, and demand the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and the peaceful resolution of the German question. This demand is irresistible. Anyone who continues to adhere to the original path, regardless of the people's wishes and the requirements of the times, will only end up in a more tragic fate than Hitler's aggressors and their appeasers.

    历史决不容许重演
    本报评论员
    在现代历史上，3月15日是一个不能使人忘记的日子。二十年前的今天，希特勒德国在英、法帝国主义者可耻的姑息政策的纵容下，侵占了当时的资产阶级独立国家捷克斯洛伐克。为了再一次提醒世界各国舆论注意这个惨痛的历史教训，捷克斯洛伐克政府最近发表了关于德国法西斯占领捷克斯洛伐克二十周年的备忘录。它要求反希特勒同盟各国，首先是那些遭受法西斯德国侵略的国家进行合作，来反对和制止德国军国主义复活的危险，为维护欧洲与世界的和平而努力。
    欧洲的局势在战后发生了根本的变化。二十年前由于资产阶级统治的软弱无能而只能任人宰割的捷克斯洛伐克，今天已成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家。捷克斯洛伐克的人民成了自己国家的主人。他们正在可靠地保卫着本国的自由独立，并同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的人民一起，为维护世界和平与促进人类进步事业作出重要的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克曾经遭受过希特勒侵略的灾害，它的人民在战胜法西斯德国的斗争中起了不可低估的作用。因此，捷克斯洛伐克有参与解决德国问题的充分权利。它要求尽速缔结对德和约与和平解决德国问题的呼声应该受到世界的重视。中国人民完全支持苏联政府在3月2日致西方国家复照中所提出的建议，认为波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加东西方会议的工作，会有助于德国问题和欧洲安全问题的解决。
    二十年前的事实已经成为历史。但是在西方国家中，今天却还有人在走着二十年前的老路。那些曾经制造和开动希特勒德国的战争机器，给欧洲各国带来巨大灾难的人们，今天又在西德政府窃据要津，并且跃跃欲试地企图重新实现已被粉碎了的希特勒的侵略迷梦。而那些新的张伯伦和达拉第们也已忘记了历史的教训，又想用自己的卵翼来培植西德军国主义势力，以便达到他们在第二次世界大战前夕曾经设想过的目的。一切爱好和平的国家和人民对此不能不提高警惕。
    但是，历史决不容许重演。各国人民不能眼看着在短短半个世纪中就给世界带来两次血腥灾难的德国，重新变为发动另一次更大规模屠杀的战争策源地。他们支持苏联政府的和平建议，支持德意志民主共和国的和平民主政策，要求尽早缔结对德和约，结束西柏林的占领制度，和平解决德国问题。这种要求是不可抗拒的。谁要是不顾人民的愿望和时代的要求而继续坚持原来的道路，谁就只会得到比希特勒侵略者及其纵容者更悲惨的下场。
