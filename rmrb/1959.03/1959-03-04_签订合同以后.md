After Signing the Contract
　　Lü Xilin, Li Ce
On February 6th, responsible comrades from the iron and steel, coal, mining, and transportation departments in the Emei area signed a comprehensive collaboration and competition contract at Baoguo Temple at the foot of Mount Emei. They jointly agreed that each factory and mining enterprise must transport "grain and grass" to the iron and steel industry in accordance with the stipulated quantity, quality, time, and location, forming a united front "taking steel as the key link." From that day on, the flames of the great leap forward in the steel industry this year were ignited in the Emei area.

After He Pinhua, the young mine director of Longchi Coal Mine, signed the collaboration and competition contract in the Emei area, he felt an additional burden: in order to shorten the transportation line, the higher authorities requested that Longchi Coal Mine quickly take over the entire coke supply task of the nearby Qianghua Steel Plant. This mine was only established in October last year by merging several small coal kilns, and it can only produce about 100 tons of coke per day, while Qianghua Steel Plant consumes 400 tons per day. How could it possibly handle this? The burden was heavy, but at the same time, he felt that this task was very glorious.

Back at the mine, he didn't even bother to sleep, and reported to the Party Committee Secretary, and convened an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee overnight. After dawn, he immediately summoned all the mine workers for an emergency mobilization. During the Spring Festival, He Pinhua spent his holiday nervously by the coke oven. Coincidentally, problems occurred one after another in production after the Spring Festival: four kilns of foamy coke came out in a row, which turned into coke powder when it fell to the ground, and could not be used for ironmaking at all. He quickly summoned the experienced workers and the coke-making section chief for a "consultation." Everyone spoke their minds, and finally found out the problems in kiln loading, kiln temperature, and fire watching. The workers immediately took action to improve operations in all aspects. Coke production increased day by day. In just a few days, the daily coke production of the entire mine rose to 136 tons.

During this period, the mine also formulated a development plan, seized the basic construction and further experimented with using more inferior coal for coking, and rapidly expanded coke production. After these measures are implemented, it will be possible to take over the entire coke supply task of Qianghua Steel Plant starting in the second quarter.

After signing the competition contract, the miners of the Xinchang Mining Field immediately began to build roads in the mining area to transport the ore to the roadside. In the mountains more than 1,000 meters above sea level, in winter, there are continuous rains and the roads are muddy. The ore is piled up in the mining field and cannot be transported out at any time. When the cars arrive at the mine, they often cannot get the ore. The miners decided to immediately eliminate this disconnection.

Hundreds of employees from various work areas and the mine headquarters nervously wielded hoes, carried sand and soil, and built branch lines of roads. Each work area also stepped up the laying of wooden rails, rushed to make tipper trucks, wheelbarrows, and other transportation tools to haul the ore out. In addition to taking time to repair roads every day, all mine workers also transported ore in their spare time, preparing more "grain and grass" for the blast furnace. The ore dressing team composed of veteran workers carefully picked out the low-grade ore during the mining, transportation, and loading process, so that the blast furnace could eat good materials. The grade of ore exported by the entire mine met the conditions for the competition.

Longchi Bus Station has to transport seven or eight hundred tons of ore, coke, and limestone from three directions to Qianghua Steel Plant every day, and also transport more than one hundred tons of pig iron out. In the past, the drivers did not understand the production situation of the steel plant, and transported as much as they could. Sometimes the blast furnace went hungry. After the collaboration and competition started, the drivers demanded that the links between transportation and steel production be closely connected, and the entire station's transportation became unprecedentedly active. Around the Spring Festival, some drivers were transferred to support the steel plant, and there were not enough people to drive. The captain Ou Zizhong, dispatcher Zeng Xiangfu, and others volunteered to help drive. Driver Liu Jiafu created a record of one person driving two cars by taking advantage of the gap while waiting for loading and unloading in order to improve transportation efficiency; driver Chen Heng, in order to prevent the car from being idle, once asked someone to drive a round trip for him while he was eating.

    签订合同以后
    吕希林　李策
    2月6日，峨眉地区的钢铁、煤炭、矿山和交通运输部门的负责同志在峨眉山下的报国寺内，签订了综合协作竞赛的合同，共同约定：各个厂矿企业必须按照规定的数量、质量、时间、地点，向钢铁工业输送
  “粮草”，结成一条“以钢为纲”的联合战线。从那一天起，峨眉地区就燃起了今年钢铁工业大跃进的烽火。
    龙池煤矿青年矿长何品华在峨眉地区协作竞赛合同上签字以后，心里增加了一层负担：上级为了缩短运输线，要求龙池煤矿迅速把邻近的强华钢铁厂全部焦炭供应任务包下来。这个矿去年10月份才由几个小煤窑合并成立，一天只能生产焦炭一百吨左右，强华钢铁厂一天却要消耗四百吨。这怎能包得了？担子是很重，但同时他也觉得这个任务很光荣。
    回到矿里，他觉也顾不得睡，就向党委书记汇报，连夜召开了党委扩大会。天亮以后又立即召集全矿职工进行紧急动员。春节期间，何品华在炼焦炉旁紧张地度过了假期，恰好春节后生产上接二连三发生了问题：一连出了四窑泡焦，摔到地上就成焦粉子，根本不能炼铁。他赶紧召集老师傅和炼焦区长“会诊”，你一言，我一语，终究找出了装窑、窑温、看火等方面的毛病。工人们立即行动起来，在各个环节上改进操作后，焦炭产量逐日上升，在短短几天中全矿日产焦炭就上升到一百三十六吨。
    在这期间，矿上又制订了发展规划，抓紧基本建设和进一步试验多掺用劣质煤炼焦，迅速扩大焦炭产量，这些措施实现之后，在第二季度开始就可把强华钢铁厂全部焦炭供应任务包下来。
    在签订竞赛合同以后，新场采矿场的矿工们立即动手修建矿区的道路，把矿石运到公路旁边。在拔海一千多公尺的矿山上，到了冬季，阴雨连绵，道路泥泞，矿石堆积在采矿场上，不能随时运出来。汽车开到了矿山，时常拉不到矿石。矿工们决定立即消除这个脱节现象。
    从各个工区和矿部来的数百名职工，紧张地挥动镢头，搬运砂土，修建了一条条公路支线。各工区也加紧敷设木轨道，赶制斗车、鸡公车和其他运输工具，把矿石拖运出来。全矿职工除了每天抽出时间修路以外，又在业余时间运送矿石，替高炉准备更多的“粮草”。由老工人组成的选矿小组，在采矿、运输和装车过程中，细心地把品位低的矿石拣出去，让高炉吃好料。全矿输出的矿石品位都达到了竞赛的条件。
    龙池汽车站每天要把七、八百吨矿石、焦炭、石灰石从三个方向运到强华钢铁厂，还要把一百多吨生铁运出来。过去驾驶人员不了解钢铁厂的生产情况，运多少算多少，有时高炉就饿着肚子。协作竞赛开始以后，驾驶人员都要求把运输和钢铁生产之间的环节严密地衔接起来，全站运输空前活跃起来。春节前后，有的驾驶员被调去支援钢铁厂，开车的人不够，队长欧自中、调度员曾祥富等就自告奋勇去帮助开车。驾驶员刘加福为了提高运输效率，利用等待装卸的空隙创造了一人开双车的纪录；驾驶员陈衡为了不叫车子歇空，有一次他在吃饭的时候也叫别人替他开一个来回。
