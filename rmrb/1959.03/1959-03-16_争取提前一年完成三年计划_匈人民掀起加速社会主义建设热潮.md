Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 14th: The Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, have launched a surge to accelerate socialist construction. People from all walks of life are vigorously engaged in the construction upsurge to complete the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.

The Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on March 6th put forward a combat task to the people of the whole country: to make the main indicators of the national economy reach the level stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1960 by the end of this year. This includes the gross output of socialist industry, the cost of industrial products, labor productivity, as well as agricultural production, investment, the actual income of employees, and the actual income of farmers, all to be achieved one year ahead of schedule.

This inspiring call from the Party has been warmly responded to by the people of the whole country. At present, workers in various places have launched labor competitions, proposing to further exert their efforts, tap production potential, improve technology and labor productivity, and vigorously improve product quality and reduce costs to build the socialist motherland at a faster pace.

The Budapest Municipal Party Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held an enlarged meeting on the 11th to discuss how to implement the resolutions of the Party Central Committee. The workers of the Csepel Iron and Steel and Machine Manufacturing United Plant in the city guaranteed to save 150 million forints this year, while the original plan was to save 130 million forints. The most important products of this factory will exceed the targets set by the Party Central Committee this year. For example, the production of steel pipes will increase by 6.9%, the production of motorcycles will increase by 5%, and the steel pipe plant producing for China will complete its task five months ahead of schedule.

The workers of the Lenin Iron and Steel United Enterprise, another major steel center in Hungary, unanimously decided after discussing the resolutions of the Enlarged Meeting of the Party Central Committee to produce 40,000 tons more steel this year without increasing investment, reduce production costs by 5%, increase labor productivity by 8%, and increase the total output of the plant by 8% compared to last year.

The workers of agricultural machinery manufacturing plants across the country have also launched labor competitions. They jointly proposed to strengthen collaboration, to better support agriculture, and to ensure that agricultural machinery worth 35 million forints is produced in excess of the plan this year.

On the basis of the rapid development of the cooperativization movement, farmers are now actively engaged in intense spring plowing and sowing work. The broad masses of farmers have warmly responded to the call of the Party and the government to produce more grain, vegetables, fruits, and livestock products this year.

The total value of agricultural production in the country this year will increase by at least 8.7%. The area of improved cultivated land will increase by a quarter compared to last year, the irrigated area will increase by a fifth, and the amount of chemical fertilizer applied per hold (approximately 8.55 mu) of cultivated land will increase by 14% compared to last year, which is more than 60,000 tons more than the original quota set for 1959 in the Three-Year Plan.

Due to the rapid development of the cooperativization movement, the labor enthusiasm of collective farmers is particularly high this year. In Győr-Sopron County, spring barley has been sown on nearly 40,000 holds of land in the past week. In Szolnok County, spring plowing and fertilization have been completed on 140,000 holds of land. Tractor drivers at some agricultural machinery stations in the Tisza River basin are working day and night to complete spring plowing ahead of schedule, fertilizing at night and sowing during the day. In the area of culture, science and education, the Party Central Committee's cultural program is currently being implemented universally and deeply across the country, the struggle against revisionism is being further carried out, and education and transformation of intellectuals are being strengthened, so that cultural and educational work can better serve the broad masses of workers and peasants. Whether they are older writers or young writers who have emerged in the struggle, they are actively engaged in creation. Recently, more and more plays and films reflecting real-world issues have been staged in theaters. (Attached picture)

    争取提前一年完成三年计划
    匈人民掀起加速社会主义建设热潮
    新华社布达佩斯14日电　匈牙利全国人民在社会主义工人党的领导下掀起了加速社会主义建设的热潮。各界劳动人民都朝气蓬勃地投入了提前一年完成三年计划的建设热潮中。
    社会主义工人党3月6日的中央扩大会议向全国劳动人民提出了战斗的任务：要求到今年年底使国民经济的主要指标达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平，其中包括社会主义工业的总生产量、工业产品的成本、劳动生产率以及农业生产、投资、职工的实际收入和农民的实际收入等指标都要提前一年达到。
    党这一振奋人心的号召得到全国人民的热烈响应。目前各地职工纷纷展开了劳动竞赛，提出要进一步发挥干劲、挖掘生产潜力、提高技术和劳动生产率，大力提高产品质量和降低成本以更快的速度来建设社会主义祖国。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党布达佩斯市党委员会于11日召开扩大会议，讨论了如何贯彻党中央决议的问题。这个市的切佩尔钢铁和机器制造联合厂的职工们，保证今年要节约一亿五千万福林，而原订计划是节约一亿三千万福林。这个工厂最主要的产品今年都将超额完成党中央所提出的指标，如钢管的生产将提高6.9％，摩托车的生产将增加5％，为中国生产的钢管厂将提前五个月完成任务。
    匈牙利另外一个主要钢铁中心列宁钢铁联合企业的职工，在讨论了党中央扩大会议的决议后，一致决定今年要在不增加投资的情况下多生产四万吨钢，生产成本要降低5％，劳动生产率提高8％，全厂的总生产量要比去年提高8％。
    全国各地的农业机器制造厂的职工们也开展了劳动竞赛，他们共同提出了要加强协作，为了更好地支援农业，保证今年要超计划多生产价值三千五百万福林的农业机器。
    农民们在合作化运动取得迅速发展的基础上，目前正积极地投入紧张的春耕和春播工作。广大的农民热烈响应了党和政府的号召，要在今年生产更多的粮食、蔬菜、水果和畜产品。
    今年全国的农产物的生产总值最少要提高8.7％，改良耕地土壤面积要比去年增加四分之一，灌溉面积要增加五分之一，每一霍尔特（约合八·五五市亩）耕地所施用的化学肥料将比去年增加14％，这比三年计划原订1959年的定额增加六万多吨。
    由于合作化运动的迅速发展，今年集体农民的劳动热情特别高涨。吉厄尔—索普伦州一周来已在近四万霍尔特土地上播种了春大麦。索尔诺克州已有十四万霍尔特土地完成了春耕和施肥。蒂萨河流域一些农业机器站的拖拉机手为提前完成春耕在日夜不停地工作，他们夜晚施肥，白天播种。在文化科学教育方面目前全国各地正在普遍深入地贯彻党中央的文化纲领，进一步开展反修正主义的斗争，加强对知识分子的教育和改造，使文教工作更好地为广大的工农群众服务。不论年老的作家或者是在斗争中涌现出来的青年作家，都在积极地从事创作。近来各戏院上演的反映现实问题的剧本和影片一天比一天多起来。（附图片）
