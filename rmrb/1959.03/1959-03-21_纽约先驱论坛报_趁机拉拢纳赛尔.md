Xinhua News Agency, March 20th, New York: The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote on the 18th: "The consequences of the failed rebellion in the Mosul region of Iraq leave no doubt that this was a major riot, if not instigated by United Arab Republic President Nasser, then at least encouraged by him. This can be clearly seen from Cairo's vehement reaction."

The newspaper said that the failure of the Mosul rebellion has "dealt a new blow" to Nasser's prestige. It also pointed out: "Nasser's situation is becoming increasingly isolated... It is precisely at times like these that one can reasonably expect him to desperately attempt to improve relations with the West."

    “纽约先驱论坛报”趁机拉拢纳赛尔
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”18日写道：“伊拉克摩苏尔地区所发生的失败的叛乱的后果，使人毫不怀疑，这是一次大暴动，假如不是由阿联总统纳赛尔所策动的，那至少是他所鼓励的。人们可以从开罗的激烈的反应中清楚地看到这一点。”
    这家报纸说，摩苏尔叛乱的失败，给纳赛尔的威信“带来新的打击”。它还指出：“纳赛尔的处境越来越孤立了。……正是在像现在这样的时候，人们可以合理地预料，他将拼命企图改善同西方的关系。”
