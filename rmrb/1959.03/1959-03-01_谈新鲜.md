    On Freshness
    Yi Heyuan
    Last year, I heard a *xiangsheng* (comic dialogue), and I was deeply impressed because its presentation was very fresh to me. This technique can be called the "pretend deafness method" – deliberately pretending to be deaf, seizing on a topic to elaborate and expound a principle. For example, if Person A says "eating," Person B would say, "You want to make trouble? Making trouble will be punished by law..." If Person A says "reading," Person B would say, "You want to feed pigs? That's great; our country is vigorously developing animal husbandry now..."
    However, later in magazines and on the radio, I saw and heard *xiangsheng* with the same presentation technique again and again. After inquiring, I found out that this technique, which seemed very fresh to me, was actually not so fresh. Many people use it. We have a saying in Sichuan: "The first time it's fragrant, the second time it stinks..." This is indeed very true. When looking at paintings, one can't always look at "fairies standing among white clouds"; when reading poetry, one can't always read "kick away the Kunlun Mountains with one foot," "Chang'e in the moon wants to descend to earth." Seeing and reading too many things that follow the same pattern makes one lose appetite.
    If poems, articles, and paintings are to be liked and cherished, the element of "freshness" is essential. I think no one likes old clichés. The farmer-poet Wang Lao Jiu said in an article: "Some people write poems that are dry and only shout slogans; some people also use metaphors, but the metaphors are also old clichés..." He also said: "Afraid of difficulties, afraid of using one's brain, one will not be able to write good things in one's lifetime..." This is very pertinent. "Freshness" is inseparable from creation; to create, one must use one's brain. Without hard work, wanting to write the newest and most beautiful poems, to paint the newest and most beautiful paintings, is of course impossible. Wang Lao Jiu's article is very popular with readers. I think the main reason is that the content of the article is relatively fresh, the writing is simple and unique, and the language is vivid, without intellectual affectation. However, some people feel that there is a flaw: the poem that the author quotes himself, "Three years cannot finish singing one cow ear," this metaphor is perhaps not very fresh either. It can be seen that to achieve freshness, one must put more effort into using one's brain.
    Our country has many fresh things: new inventions, new creations, new records, new people are constantly emerging. Whether in cities and villages, in factories and schools, everywhere is a new atmosphere, making people happy and encouraged. No wonder many cadres who go to factories and the countryside, or students who go home for holidays, can't help but pick up a pen and write a few words to praise them. If you ask where these fresh things come from? In the final analysis, it is inseparable from "people," or more precisely, from our "new generation." Since they are new people, they are not simple. They have new minds, new ideas, new styles, are both active and creative; they are both able to work hard and diligently, and are able to work cleverly; they are both able to learn from others with an open mind, and are not satisfied with catching up with others, but want to surpass them and create new achievements. They are not like some people who always imitate others. If someone writes about "gods changing careers," they will come up with "Sun Wukong changing jobs"; if someone paints a big winter melon, they will come up with a big radish. There is no creativity at all, let alone their own unique style.
    Freshness is relative to the old and outdated; it is constantly changing. What is fresh today will become old tomorrow and will be replaced by newer things. Take record-breaking as an example. Today's new record is advanced, but after some time, a newer record comes out, and the original record is no longer new. Our society, our country, is changing with each passing day and constantly moving forward. To achieve this, we must be brave in getting rid of the old to bring forth the new, and be bold in creating. This is the case in industry, agriculture, and other constructions, and I think the creation of literature and art is no exception. Of course, so-called playing of subjective creativity, so-called originality, must be based on subjective and objective conditions, study the laws of development of things, and be realistic. If it is unrealistic wild thoughts, formalism that is divorced from politics, that kind of freshness is worthless.

    谈新鲜
    易和元
    去年听了一个相声，印象很深，因为它的表现手法在我看来很新鲜。这种手法可以叫“装聋法”——故意装聋，借题发挥，说一通道理。比如甲说“吃饭”，乙就说“你要捣蛋？捣蛋是要受法律制裁的。……”甲说“读书”，乙就说“你要喂猪？这很好，现在我们国家正大力发展畜牧事业。……”
    但是，以后在杂志上，在广播里，一次又一次地看到和听到这种表现手法相同的相声，再一打听，原来这个在我看来很新鲜的手法，其实也不怎么新鲜。许多人都用它。我们四川有句俗话：“一道香，二道臭……”，的确很有道理。看画不能老是看“仙女站在白云间”；读诗不能老是读“一脚踢开昆仑山”，“月里嫦娥想下凡”。这样依样画葫芦的东西看多了，读多了，胃口也就败了。
    要诗、文、画使人喜欢看，爱不释手，这新鲜二字确不可少，我想不会有人喜欢老一套的东西的。农民诗人王老九在一篇文章中说：“有人写诗，干巴巴的，光喊口号；有的人也用比喻，比喻也是老一套。……”又说：“怕困难，怕费脑子，一辈子写不出好东西。……”这说得非常中肯。“新鲜”是和创造分不开的，要创造就得费脑子。不付出艰苦的劳动，就想写出最新最美的诗，画出最新最美的画，当然是做不到。王老九的这篇文章，很受读者欢迎，我想主要是文章的内容比较新鲜，写法比较朴素，别致，语言文字生动，没有知识分子腔。但是也有人感到美中不足，就是作者引的自己写的那首诗，“三年唱不完一个牛耳朵”，这个比喻也未必能算是新鲜的，可见要做到新鲜，还得多费脑子。
    我们国家新鲜的事物多得很，新发明，新创造，新记录，新人物不断出现；不论是在城市和农村，在工厂和学校，到处是气象一新，使人欢欣鼓舞，难怪很多机关干部下厂下乡走了一回，或是学生假期回家去了一趟，都忍不住要提起笔来写上三言五句，歌颂一番。若问这些新鲜事物从何而来？归根到底，是和我们“人”分不开的，更准确些说，是和我们这“一代新人”分不开的。既说是新人，那就不简单，他们有新的头脑，新的思想，新的风格，既有积极性，又有创造性；既能苦干，实干，又能巧干；既能虚心向别人学习，又不以赶上别人为满足，而要超过别人，创造新的成绩，他们不像某些人那样，老是模仿别人，人家写“神仙改行”，他就来个“孙悟空转业”；人家画个大冬瓜，他就来个大萝卜，一点创造性没有，当然更说不上自己独特的风格了。
    新鲜是和陈旧相对而言的，是不断变化着的，在今天是新鲜的东西，在明天就会变为陈旧，而为更新的东西所代替。就拿创造记录来说吧，在今天是新记录，是先进的，过一些时候，更新的记录出来了，原有的记录就不新了。我们的社会，我们的国家，就是这样日新月异、不断前进的。要做到这点，就必须勇于推陈出新，大胆创造。这在工业、农业等各项建设上是如此，对于文学艺术的创作来说，我想也是不能例外的。当然所谓发挥的客观创造性，所谓标新立异，必须依据主观和客观的条件，研究事物的发展规律，实事求是。如果是脱离实际的胡思乱想，脱离政治的形式主义，那样的新鲜是一钱不值的。
