What Do Fossils Tell Us?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chuan Liu
　　In China's medicinal materials, there is a peculiar variety called "Dragon Bone." Dragon Bone is not from the legendary "dragon," but rather bones or teeth left behind by ancient vertebrates such as rhinoceroses, deer, and horses. These creatures typically lived hundreds of thousands of years or more ago.

　　Why haven't these bones rotted after such a long time? Indeed, many have already decayed, but a small portion has been preserved after undergoing changes due to being buried in the mud and sand, offering protection. These "Dragon Bones" are mostly solidified because minerals filled the pores inside the bones. In other cases, the remains of ancient organisms are slowly and completely replaced by underground minerals, but still retain their original shape. Alternatively, the corpses decompose, forming a cavity in the sediment, and when minerals enter, they fill it like being poured into a mold, preserving the shape of the organism. Not only the organisms themselves, but even their droppings, footprints, and crawling traces can be preserved in the rocks. Over time, we can still see the remains or traces of organisms from hundreds of millions of years ago today.

　　Some biological remains can even be preserved to this day without undergoing changes. For example, insects in amber are like being stored in a glass coffin, clearly and completely preserved. In the Soviet Union, mammoths that died many years ago frozen in ice have also been discovered. All of these ancient biological remains or traces are collectively called fossils.

　　Fossils are words written on stone. They tell us many materials about the history of the Earth. For example, some organisms are only found in the ocean, and this type of fossil indicates the geographical environment at that time. The Chinese scholar Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty once pointed out, "I have seen snail and clam shells on high mountains, or growing in stones. This stone is the soil of the past, and the snails and clams are things of the water. What was low has become high, and what was soft has become hard." Here, based on fossils, he revealed the vicissitudes of life.

　　By understanding fossils and studying the properties of rocks, we can restore the historical appearance of the Earth. This greatly strikes at religious superstition and various forms of idealistic thought. Humans evolved from ancient apes, and fossils provide important evidence. In Europe, the first to recognize that fossils were the remains of ancient organisms was the famous scholar and painter Leonardo da Vinci. The church initially refused to acknowledge this discovery, and then shamelessly claimed that these were the corpses of victims of God's flood. However, as more and more fossils were discovered, people gradually found the laws of biological evolution in these fossils, and those religious lies were no longer believed.

　　Because the evolution of ancient organisms follows certain rules, we can determine the order in which rock layers were formed based on the fossils they contain, and divide the historical stages of the Earth's development. Furthermore, because certain minerals are often formed in particularly large quantities during certain historical periods, distinguishing the era to which a rock layer belongs makes it more purposeful and certain to find minerals. Therefore, fossils are very useful.

    化石告诉我们什么？
    川流
    在我国的药材中，列着一个奇异的品种“龙骨”。龙骨可不是传说中那种“龙”身上的，而是些古代的脊椎动物譬如犀牛、鹿、马等遗留下来的骨头或是牙齿。这些生物距离现在通常已有几十万年或更多的时间。
  经过了这样长久的时间，骨头为什么没有烂呢？是的，许多都已经烂了，但是有一小部分却因埋在泥沙里受到保护经过了变化以后保存了下来。像这些“龙骨”多是由于有矿物质充填在骨头内部的孔隙里，使它固结起来；还有些古生物的遗体慢慢地完全被地下的矿物质代替，但仍然保留了原来的形状，或者是尸体分解了，在泥沙里形成了一个空洞，当矿物质进入其中时，就像灌在模子里一样，把生物的形状保留了下来。不仅是生物本身，连生物拉的屎、踩的脚印以及爬行的痕迹也可在岩石中保存下来。传之久远，使我们在今天还可以看见几万万年前的生物的遗体或遗迹。
    有的生物遗体居然能不经变化就保存到现在，譬如琥珀中的虫子就像藏在玻璃棺材里一样，清楚、完好地留了下来。在苏联还发现冻结在冰中死亡了多年的大象。以上这些古代生物的遗体或遗迹，统统都叫做化石。
    化石是写在石头上的文字，它告诉了我们许多有关地球历史的材料，譬如说有些生物是海洋中才有的，这种化石便说明了当时的地理环境。我国宋代学者朱熹便曾指出：“尝见高山有螺蚌壳，或生石中，此石即旧日之土，螺蚌即水中之物，下者却变为高，柔者却变为刚。”他在这里根据化石道出了沧桑的变迁。
    靠着对化石的认识以及对岩石性质的研究，我们就能恢复起地球的历史面貌，这就大大打击了宗教迷信以及各色唯心主义的思想。人是从古猿变来的，化石提供了重要的证据。在欧洲，最早认出化石是古代生物遗体的是著名的学者、画家达·文西，教会对这个发现始则不承认，继则无赖地说这是上帝降洪水时罹难者的尸体。但是以后人们发现的化石愈来愈多，从这些化石中人们也逐渐找到了生物演化的规律，那些宗教的谎言便再也无人相信了。
    由于古代生物的演化是有规律可寻的，因此可以根据岩层中有什么化石来确定它们生成的先后，划分出地球发展的历史阶段。又因为某种矿藏常常在一定历史时期生成得特别多，分辨了岩层所属时代，找起矿来就更有目的更有把握了，所以化石是很有用的东西。
