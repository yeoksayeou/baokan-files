Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 17th: A large-scale demonstration against Iraq and against the Communist Party was organized in Cairo on the 16th. UAR Vice President Amer delivered an anti-Iraq and anti-communist speech to the demonstrators. The demonstrators carried coffins, and on both sides of the coffins were pasted portraits of Qasim, with words such as: "Qasim of Iraq is the executioner of Baghdad." The demonstrators shouted slogans similar to those shouted by the crowds in Damascus these days, such as "Death to Qasim," "Down with the brutal rule of Iraq," "Down with the communist traitors," "Communism will not be allowed to exist among the Arab nation," and "Nasser is the only leader." In the afternoon, a memorial service was held in Republic Square for the dead Mosul rebels.
    In his speech at the memorial service, Amer attacked the communists in the UAR as "agents, traitors, and rebels," saying that they "oppose the free people of Iraq and undermine Iraqi Arab nationalism, and are expanding to eliminate the UAR and Arab nationalism in all Arab countries."
    He slandered Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim as having "usurped leadership." He described the measures taken by the Iraqi government in response to the Mosul rebellion as "the conspiracy of agents." He insisted that the suppressed Shawwaf rebellion was a "revolution against oppression, autocracy, dictatorship, against terrorism and barbaric actions." He described Arif, who was sentenced to death by the Iraqi court for treason, as "the person who truly led the revolution."

    开罗组织反伊反共游
    行竟开会追悼死了的摩苏尔叛乱分子  阿密尔发表演说攻击伊拉克和伊共
    新华社开罗17日电　开罗16日组织了大规模的反对伊拉克和反对共产党的示威游行。阿联副总统阿密尔向示威群众发表了反伊反共的演说。示威游行者抬着棺材，棺材两旁贴着卡塞姆的画像，还写着这样的话：“伊拉克的卡塞姆是巴格达的刽子手”。示威游行者高喊：“处死卡塞姆”、“打倒伊拉克的残暴统治”、“打倒共产党卖国贼”、“不容许共产主义在阿拉伯民族中存在”、“纳赛尔是唯一的领袖”这样一些同大马士革这几天举行示威的群众所喊的一样的口号。下午，还在共和国广场为死去的摩苏尔叛乱分子举行了追悼会。
    阿密尔在追悼会上发表的演说中攻击阿联的共产党人是“代理人、卖国贼和叛徒”，说他们“反对伊拉克的自由人民和破坏伊拉克的阿拉伯民族主义，并且进行扩张以消灭阿联和所有阿拉伯国家的阿拉伯民族主义”。
    他污蔑伊拉克总理卡塞姆“僣取了领导地位”。他把伊拉克政府对摩苏尔叛乱事件所采取的措施说成是“代理人的阴谋”。他硬说被平服了的沙瓦夫的叛乱是“反对压迫、专制、独裁，反对恐怖主义和野蛮行动的革命”。他把因犯有叛国罪而被伊拉克法庭判处死刑的阿里夫说成是“真正领导革命的人”。
