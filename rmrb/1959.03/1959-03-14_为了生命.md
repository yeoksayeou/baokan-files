    For Life
    Li Wen, Ji Liu
    A middle-aged man, over forty, carrying a medicine bag, walked out of Crab Cave, around the mountain rocks, and towards the Baiyi Nunnery construction site. From the yellow mud all over his body and his difficult steps, it could be seen that a day's mountain road had exhausted him.
    The middle-aged man walked to the entrance of the workers' shed of the Second Battalion of the Tuan Yun Mine in the suburbs of Santai County. The cook immediately greeted him with a smile and said, "Doctor Wang, are you tired? Come and eat."
    "Not too tired, but I am hungry."
    Doctor Wang took off his medicine bag, still panting. This morning, he climbed the misty Guanwu Mountain to see patients for the steel warriors at several construction sites. Crossing mountains and ridges was indeed not an easy task for this doctor who had only recently arrived from the western Sichuan plain.
    Doctor Wang had just sat down when he heard shouts of someone falling and getting injured from the mountain. He picked up his medicine bag and ran out. When the cook brought a bowl of hot rice into the workers' shed, he had already crossed the stream in front of the shed and disappeared into the sea of fog.
    The mountains were high and the roads were narrow, thick fog filled the air, and it was impossible to see your fingers. In addition, it had been raining for several days, and the road was full of mud. Doctor Wang ran towards the Nose Bridge Mountain Rock with one foot high and one foot low. Anxious, he only cared about hurrying on his way, and without thinking, he bumped into someone. Judging from the accent, it was the deputy company commander.
    "How is the person who fell?" Doctor Wang asked anxiously.
    "It seems he's not going to make it."
    The deputy company commander said sadly, "He was a good young man, he fell from a mountain rock more than ten zhang high..."
    "I'll go take a look!" Doctor Wang climbed over the mountain rock and hurried to a small thatched shed below the rock. As soon as he entered, he saw a young man lying on the ground. He rushed forward, felt his hand, which was already cold; moved his leg, which was already stiff. He quickly unbuttoned the young man's cotton coat, which had been torn to pieces by the thorn forest, and with the greatest hope, gently placed his trembling hand on his chest. "Ah! There is still a very slight beat here..." Doctor Wang made up his mind: he must save him!
    However, the night was already deep, he couldn't find any medicine, and there was no medical equipment. Doctor Wang suddenly crawled onto the ground, put his mouth on the young man's mouth and began to breathe air into him, once, twice, three times... He had climbed the mountain all day, and had not eaten in the evening. Doctor Wang felt dizzy and his breathing gradually weakened. A series of explosions rolled over the top of the thatched shed. He thought of the Party sending him to support the mining area, and thought of the vigor of the steel warriors on Guanwu Mountain. He gathered his spirits and continued to breathe air into the young man who was struggling on the line of death.
    At this time, the company political instructor heard the news of the person who had fallen and quickly boiled a pot of ginger soup, crossed two mountain ridges, and pushed the door in. In this deep mountain night, the cold wind whistled, and the small stream in front of the thatched shed had already frozen. Doctor Wang looked at the young man lying on the ground and quickly took off his own cotton coat and put it on him. The company political instructor brought the ginger soup over, then took off his own cotton coat and gently put it on Doctor Wang's shoulders.
    At dawn, the young man's pulse began to beat.
    "Ah, he's alive!" Doctor Wang and the political instructor exclaimed in surprise. The young man opened his eyes slightly and grabbed the doctor's hand.
    "What is your name, which regiment are you from?"
    "My name is Gong Xude, from the Flying Horse Regiment."
    "Ah, the Flying Horse Regiment," the political instructor became excited, "that is our competition opponent."
    Dawn broke, and the entire Guanwu Mountain was boiling again. The sound of vehicles and people were noisy in the clouds and fog, and a huge explosion shook the mountains and valleys...

    为了生命
    力文　吉六
    一个四十开外的中年人，背着一个药包，走出螃蟹洞，绕过山岩，向白衣庵工地走来。从那满身黄泥和艰难的步伐可以看出，一天的山路，已经把他累得精疲力尽了。
    中年男子走到三台县城郊团运矿二营工棚门口，炊事员立即满面笑容地迎出来说：“王医生，累了吧，快吃饭。”
    “累倒不太累，肚子是饿了。”
    王医生把药包取下来，口里还在喘气。今天清早，他爬上吞云吐雾的观雾山，到几个工地给钢铁战士看病。翻山越岭，对这个前不久才从川西平原来的医生来说，的确不是一件容易的事。
    王医生刚刚坐下，就听到山上传来跌伤人的喊叫声，他背起药包就往外跑。当炊事员端着一钵热腾腾的饭走进工棚时，他已经跨过工棚前的溪流，消失在雾海里了。
    山高路窄，浓雾弥漫，伸手不见五指，加上一连下过几天阴雨，路上尽是泥泞。王医生高一脚低一步地向鼻梁拐山岩跑去。心里着急，只顾低着头赶路，没提防，一头撞在一个人身上，听口音，是副连长。
    “跌伤的人怎样了？”王医生焦急地问。
    “好像不行了。”
    副连长难过地说：“是个好小伙子，从十多丈高的山岩上跌下来……”
    “我去看看！”王医生翻过山岩，急急忙忙向岩下一间小茅棚赶去。一进门，看到一个青年正躺在地下。他抢上前去，摸摸手，手已变冷；搬搬腿，腿已发硬。他急忙解开年青人被刺林撕得稀烂的棉衣，怀着最大的希望，用颤抖的手轻轻贴在他的心口上。“呵！这里还有一点极轻微的跳动呢……”王医生下定决心：一定要把他救活！
    可是，夜已经深了，药物找不到，医疗器械又没有，怎么办呢？王医生霍地爬到地上，用自己的嘴贴在青年人的嘴上开始度气，一次二次，三次……。白天爬了一整天的山，晚上又没吃饭，王医生感到头昏眼花，呼气逐渐微弱下来。一阵??的爆破声从茅棚顶上滚过，他想起了党派他来支援矿区，想起了观雾山上钢铁战士的干劲，又提起精神给这位在死亡线上挣扎的青年继续度气。
    这时，连指导员听到跌伤人的消息，赶忙烧了一壶姜汤，翻过两道山梁，推门进来。在这深山的夜晚，寒风嗖嗖，茅棚前面的一道小溪，已经结冰了。王医生看了一下躺在地上的年青人，忙把自己的棉衣脱下来，盖在他的身上。连指导员把姜汤送过去，接着脱下自己的棉衣，轻轻的披在王医生的肩上。
    天麻麻亮时，年青人的脉搏开始跳动了。
    “呵，他活了！”王医生和指导员惊喜地叫了起来。年青人微微地睁开眼睛，拉住医生的手。
    “你叫什么名字，哪个团的？”
    “我叫龚绪德，飞马团的。”
    “呵，飞马团，”指导员兴奋起来：“那是我们竞赛的对手。”
    天亮了，整个观雾山又沸腾起来。车声、人声，在云雾里喧闹，一声巨大的爆炸声，震得山鸣谷应……。
