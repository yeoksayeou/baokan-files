　　Dad told the child the story of "Big Black Bear": "Two little girls, carrying baskets to the forest to pick mushrooms, met Grandma Bear,..." -- Dad described the little girls' long braids, tied with red bows, Grandma Bear's mouth was pointed, her teeth were long, her tongue stuck out, and she wanted to eat them... The child listened intently and started to draw. First, he drew the big black bear. After finishing the bear, he drew the older sister. The child said seriously, "The older sister is big, she stands in front, persuading Grandma Bear not to eat them." So he drew according to his own ideas, the older sister protecting the younger sister, her arm reaching out to the bear, one hand blocking the bear. Not yet satisfied, he added an even younger sister at the very end, holding a rattle drum. The child supplemented the story with his own imagination and life knowledge.
　　This is a common scene of a child drawing at home. Such induction and enlightenment of children's creativity is no longer a rare phenomenon. With the improvement of people's material and cultural life, more and more families are beginning to care about the spiritual growth of children. Society not only generally attaches importance to the education of children and young people, but also gives due attention and care to those children who show artistic talent. In the old society, art was occupied by a few people, and the young buds of genius were often buried before they could grow up.
　　In the Young Pioneer Palaces, in schools, and in families, we everywhere embody the Party and the people's care and cultivation of children's artistic talents. From many children's art exhibitions, we can see the creativity of children across the country in fine arts. Children have keen and fresh feelings about real life, and they can wonderfully and delicately depict the reality around them. In Chinese children's paintings, we often see various interesting games, affectionate depictions of small animals, and love for spring, flowers, butterflies, and birds. Little girls like to draw beautiful patterns; chickens, white rabbits, and classical beauties. Boys like to draw imposing tigers; horses running with straight tails; ancient military generals holding big swords, wearing swords at their waists, and helmets on their heads. When you see the festive night scene of "May Day", the glittering of the Young Pioneer campfire, the small silhouettes of children climbing onto the roof in the moonlight to see the Soviet satellite; a long train speeding across the Han River Bridge, emitting thick smoke; when you see not one or two but rows of kites flying into the sky... you can't help but feel excited, as if through the children's paintings, you once again recognize and feel life!
　　A five-year-old child drew "Selling Watermelons," a cart full of watermelons, half of them cut open, revealing black seeds and red flesh. The watermelon seller, wearing a vest and shorts, waved a banana leaf fan in one hand and a watermelon knife in the other, calling out loudly. Look, how energetic! Under the cart, a chick popped out, rushing over to peck at the melon seeds falling on the ground. The picture has both the interest of real life and is filled with children's fantasy and fun.
　　A sick child drew "My Dream - Camping," showing various camping activities unfolding on the spring grass: swimming; playing the flute by the river; wearing a straw hat and sitting on the bridge fishing; reading picture books together and cooking! ... It's so happy. This eleven-year-old child has placed so many wonderful wishes, dreams, and love for life in a painting...
　　The development of children's artistic talents contains the hard work of their elders. However, it needs to be pointed out that not all parents and teachers are good at patiently guiding and helping children to observe the surrounding life carefully; and at enlightening children's imagination and artistic creativity. Some kindergartens let children repeatedly draw some fixed regular patterns, and some middle and primary school art classes overdo the imitation of still lifes of jars and pots. Of course, basic training in art class is absolutely necessary, but we cannot just use one method to make the children's art world so small, limiting their active artistic thinking, creativity, and artistic imagination, so that some children's paintings are too restrained, timid, or simply imitate adult paintings. This is a problem worth noting.
　　Parents are also the most closely related to the growth of children. Parents consciously or unconsciously influence the next generation every day. A few parents, when they discover that their child has some artistic talent, exaggerate it; they take their children around, visit people, ask famous artists to inscribe and sign their children's paintings, and socialize with artists. Doing so is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, and besides ruining the child's talent, it has no good results.
　　In socialist society, art is no longer forced to be a means of survival and fishing for fame and praise; art has a noble social purpose. In this way, the healthy growth of children's artistic talents has the most fundamental guarantee. In this regard, the child's parents, teachers, and artists all have a responsibility to cultivate these young buds—in the future, they will surely be the blooming flowers in our garden.

    好好护新芽

    爸爸给孩子讲了“大黑熊”的故事：“有两个小姑娘，挎着篮子到森林里去采蘑菇，遇到了熊外婆，……”——爸爸形容小姑娘长长的辫子，扎着红蝴蝶结，熊外婆的嘴是尖的、牙齿是长的、舌头露在外面，要吃她们……。孩子听得入神了，就画起来，先画大黑熊，画着、画着，大熊画完了，又画了姐姐，孩子认真地说：“姐姐大，挡在前面，劝熊外婆不要吃她们。”于是照自己的想法画了，姐姐保护着妹妹，胳膊向熊伸过去，一手挡着熊。还没有尽兴，又加了一个更小的妹妹，在最后头，拿着啵啷鼓，孩子用自己的想像和生活知识补充了故事。
    这是孩子在家里画画时的普通情景，像这样诱导、启发儿童的创造力，已不是稀有的现象了。随着人民物质、文化生活的提高，越来越多的家庭开始关心儿童在精神上的成长。社会上不仅一般地重视少年儿童的教育问题，而且，对于那些萌露艺术天才的儿童，总是给予应有的注意和关心。在旧社会，艺术曾被少数人占有，天才的幼芽不等长大，往往就被埋没了。
    我们在少先宫、在学校和家庭里，处处体现着党和人民对儿童艺术天才的关怀和培植。从许多次儿童画展，可以看到全国各地的孩子在美术上的创造。孩子们对现实生活有敏锐和新鲜的感受，而且能够美妙地、细致地描绘周围的现实，在我国的儿童画里，常常看到各种有趣的游戏，对小动物充满感情的描绘，对春天、对花、对蝴蝶和鸟的喜爱。小姑娘们喜欢画美丽的图案；小鸡、小白兔和古典美人，男孩子们喜欢画气势眈眈的老虎；直着尾巴奔跑的马；手持大刀、腰挎宝剑、头戴帽盔的古代武将。当你看到“五一”节欢腾的夜景，少先队营火的闪光，在月光下爬上屋顶去看苏联人造卫星的小小背影；穿过汉水大铁桥，吐着浓烟在奔驰的长长一列火车；当你看到不是一个、两个而是成排的风筝飞上天去……不由得满心激动，好像通过孩子的画，又再一次认识、感受了生活！
    一个五岁的孩子画了“卖西瓜”，满车的西瓜，一、半个切开了，露出黑子红瓤。身穿背心短裤的卖瓜人，一手舞着芭蕉扇；一手挥着切瓜刀，仰头叫卖。你看，神气得很呢！车底下，钻出一支小公鸡，急奔过来，啄食掉落在地上的瓜子，画面既有真实生活的情趣，又洋溢着儿童的幻想和趣味。
    一个病中的孩子，画了“我的梦——野营”，在春天草地上，展开了各种各样的野营活动：游泳呵；小河边吹笛子呀；戴着草帽坐在桥头钓鱼呀；一起看画报又自己烧饭哪！……真是快活极了。这十一岁的孩子，在一幅画里寄予了多少美妙的愿望、梦想和对生活的热爱……。
    孩子们艺术才能的发展，包含着长辈的心血。但是，需要指出：还不是所有的家长和老师都善于谆谆诱导，帮助孩子留心观察周围的生活；启发儿童的想像力和美术创造才能。有的幼儿园，随便让孩子反复画一些固定的规则图案，有些中、小学校的美术课过多地临摹；或常出一些坛坛罐罐的静物，当然，美术课的基本训练是完全必要的，但是不能只是用一种方法，把儿童的艺术天地圈得这样小，限制了他们积极的艺术思维活动、创造性和艺术想像力，使得一些孩子的画过分拘谨、胆小，或是简单地模仿大人画。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    家长对儿童的成长也是关系最密切的，父母亲每天在自觉或不自觉地影响着下一代。有少数家长，发现孩子在艺术上稍有所长，就大加吹嘘；带孩子奔走四方、登门作客、请名家给孩子的画题字落款，周旋于艺术家之中，这样做，就是拔苗助长，除了毁了孩子的才能以外，没有什么好结果。
    在社会主义社会里，艺术不再被迫作为求生和沽名钓誉的手段；艺术，具有崇高的社会目的。这样，儿童艺术才能的健康成长就有了最根本的保证。在这方面，孩子的双亲、教师、艺术家们都有责任来培植这些幼小的蓓蕾——在明天，他们必然是我们百花园里盛开的鲜花。
