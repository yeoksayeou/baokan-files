Taking "Steel as the Key Link for Overall Leap Forward" is the Party's construction policy on the industrial front for the present and for a relatively long period in the future. It embodies the objective law of planned and proportionate development in the Party's general line for socialist construction. It was precisely because the policy of "taking steel as the key link" was implemented in 1958 that great achievements were made, with steel production doubling, completing a journey that took capitalist countries seven to thirty-two years to complete in just one year. Due to the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry, industrial sectors such as coal, machinery, electricity, chemicals, light industry, and textiles have all developed accordingly, forming an overall leap forward situation of "one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping," laying a material foundation for a greater leap forward this year and in the future. Here, I will explore the proportional relationships between the iron and steel industry and various sectors of the national economy in terms of how to implement the principle of "taking steel as the key link for overall leap forward" and "the whole country as a coordinated chess game."

The Relationship Between Raw Material Industries and Processing Industries

The relationship between raw material industries and processing industries, specifically, is mainly the relationship between the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry.

China's industry was backward in the past. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, it has greatly developed in recent years. During the First Five-Year Plan, steel production increased by an average of 31.7% per year, and the output value of the machinery industry increased by an average of 34.6% per year. However, China's iron and steel industry and machinery industry are still very weak and far from meeting the requirements of the national economy's high-speed development. Therefore, we require both the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry to develop vigorously and simultaneously, while maintaining an appropriate ratio between them. Only in this way can we accelerate socialist construction, accelerate the technical equipment of the national economy, accelerate the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and accelerate the development of transportation. It is precisely based on the requirements of vigorously developing the machinery industry that it is necessary to fully guarantee the machinery industry with sufficient raw materials, in other words, to supply a sufficient quantity of steel materials.

At present, the supply of metal raw materials, generally speaking, still cannot meet the requirements of the existing machinery industry in terms of quantity and variety.

The construction of the machinery industry, relatively speaking, is faster and easier than the construction of the iron and steel industry. The construction of the iron and steel industry requires large investments, long construction periods, many heavy equipment, and involves a wide range of areas and complex projects. For example, building a one-million-ton steel plant takes five to six years from the start of exploration and design to completion. It involves not only geological exploration work, the construction of major production departments such as mines, ore dressing, sintering, refractory materials, coke, chemicals, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling; but also the construction of about twenty auxiliary service departments such as transportation, water, electricity, gas, steam, and machine repair. The machinery industry, however, does not have geological mines and other units, and equipment installation is also simpler. Building a manufacturing plant with an annual output of 2,000 machine tools only takes about a year; building a 30,000-ton heavy machinery plant only takes about two years.

The machinery industry in some areas with relatively good foundations is developing in the direction of "high, precise, large, and advanced," and the demand for steel varieties is increasing with the development of science and technology. Taking the manufacture of a car as an example, dozens of steel grades and thousands of types of steel are required, and most of these raw materials must be produced with modern equipment.

It is precisely for the above reasons that we must currently attach great importance to the development of the iron and steel industry. Only by giving priority to the development of the iron and steel industry can the development of the machinery industry be adapted to the development of the metallurgical industry, and can favorable conditions be created for vigorously developing the machinery industry. What exactly is the proportional relationship between them? This is changing with the development of the national economy, the changes between industry and agriculture, and the changes between light and heavy industries. In general, the development speed of the iron and steel industry is similar to or slightly higher than the development speed of the machinery industry. If we can make the development of the iron and steel industry not only fully meet the requirements of the machinery industry, but also have reserves, then many of our things will be easier to handle. The policy of simultaneously developing the machinery industry and the iron and steel industry on the basis of giving priority to the development of the iron and steel industry has proven to be very correct.

The Relationship Between the Iron and Steel Industry and the Coal Industry

In the great leap forward of 1958, a prominent issue was how the coal industry should adapt to the development of the iron and steel industry. That is, the issue of the proportional relationship between them. This involves the production and distribution of coal, the combination of coal and steel production, and the issue of coal types.

China is a populous country, and also a country where crude oil and natural gas are not yet developed. The proportion of coal used in our fuel is very large. The distribution of coal between industry and agriculture, and between the various sectors of industry, with a certain proportion used for the iron and steel industry, has a certain proportional relationship, and this proportional relationship will change with the development of industry and agriculture. In agriculture, due to the establishment of people's communes, the development of collective welfare undertakings, the development of commune-run industries, and the improvement of people's living standards, coal consumption has increased. In addition, with the gradual mechanization of agriculture, the amount of coal consumed by agriculture is increasing more and more. Similarly, the development of industry is also increasing the demand for coal. Both industry and agriculture are developing, but the proportional change between them is that the proportion of industry is increasing year by year. The proportion of industry increased from 37.6% in 1953 to 46.9% in 1957. From the perspective of the change in coal consumption per 100 million yuan of total industrial and agricultural output value, coal consumption per 100 million yuan of total industrial output value increased by more than 28% in 1957 compared with 1953. The development of industry and agriculture requires more and more coal. Therefore, supplying coal with a distinction between primary and secondary importance and using coal where it is most needed has become an important task at present.

The issue of combining steel production with coal production mainly concerns the distribution of coal and iron production. With the development of the iron and steel industry, from the past situation where the iron and steel industry was mainly concentrated in Northeast China, North China, and Shanghai, it has gradually spread across the country. In particular, the great leap forward in 1958 led to iron and steel production throughout the country. At present, the work of "five fixings" (fixing type, fixing team, fixing location, fixing personnel, fixing leadership) and "two izations" (industrialization, base construction) is being carried out. There are already many iron and steel bases in areas south of the Yangtze River, but because the development of coal in the southern regions cannot keep up with the needs of the iron and steel industry, this has led to the problem of transporting coal from the north to the south, which not only involves large volumes but also long-distance transportation, increasing the burden on transportation. Developing the iron and steel industry in areas south of the Yangtze River is very necessary, and there is also the foundation for the leap forward in 1958. The difficulty is the coal problem, and the coal problem is again a transportation problem. For the development of the iron and steel industry in areas south of the Yangtze River, judging from the current situation, some coal can be transported from the north to the south, but this cannot meet the requirements of large-scale development. It is necessary to concentrate efforts to carry out coalfield construction and production work in areas south of the Yangtze River. It can be believed that in a very short period of time, the coal industry in the southern regions will have great development, creating favorable conditions for the development of the iron and steel industry in the southern regions.

In order to combine coal and iron production, in future construction and current "five fixings" and "two izations" work, it is necessary to locate iron and steel bases close to coal mines and iron mines, adopting the method of locating at both ends of coal mines and iron mines in order to greatly save transportation capacity.

The issue of coal types. Not all coal can be used for coking. Only coal with good caking properties and appropriate volatile matter can be used for coking. Coking coal is an important condition for the development of the iron and steel industry. At present, the national coke production cannot meet the needs. Therefore, saving coking coal is a very important issue. In the current situation, some places consume as much as seven or eight tons of coking coal to refine one ton of iron, while others consume less than one ton. If we can strive to refine one ton of iron with two tons of coking coal, then a lot of coking coal will be saved. The use of coking coal should first ensure the needs of key enterprises, such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. After ensuring the key points, then take care of the general. In order to adapt to the needs of this year's great leap forward in steel, the development of the coking industry should also be considered. This year, various parts of the country are vigorously carrying out the construction of simple coking furnaces. The location of coke ovens must consider combining them as much as possible with the origin of coking coal, considering transportation, electricity, water, and other conditions, and considering the combination with ironmaking plants. If the location is unreasonable, it will not only bring difficulties to future production, but also increase production costs due to economic irrationality.

In short, steel production and coal problems are closely related. Without coal, there is no iron and steel industry. For the development of the iron and steel industry, it is currently necessary to seize the production and construction of coal, especially seizing the construction of coking coal and coal washing.

The Relationship Between the Iron and Steel Industry and Transportation

Transportation is an "independent material production sector." Every production unit cannot do without it. Without it, social production cannot proceed. Production arrangements must be accompanied by corresponding transportation arrangements. Otherwise, if transportation and production are disconnected, production imbalances will occur, normal production will not be possible, and even production will be suspended waiting for materials.

The needs of various sectors of the national economy for transportation are growing. The growth in transport volume is not keeping up with the growth of industry and agriculture, which indicates that transportation is very tight. In addition, the distribution of productive forces, some distance from raw materials or consumer areas, makes the transportation problem even more prominent.

The iron and steel industry has a great demand for transportation. An iron and steel complex needs to transport 22 tons for every ton of steel produced, of which 12 tons are transported within the plant and 10 tons are transported outside the plant. The raw materials needed for production are transported from the raw material producing areas, and the products produced are also transported to the departments that need them.

The requirements of the iron and steel industry for transportation are prominently reflected in the transportation of iron ore and coking coal. The annual transport volume for the iron and steel industry accounts for a large proportion of the total transport volume. The speed of development of the iron and steel industry is faster than the speed of growth of transportation capacity. Steel increased by 202% in 1957 compared with 1953, while transport volume only increased by a little more than 81%. Therefore, the proportion of the iron and steel industry's demand for transport volume in the total transport volume cannot but change. This change is currently that the proportion of iron and steel transport volume is increasing, especially since the great leap forward. The relationship between the growth of transport volume and the growth of the national economy, the proportion of iron and steel industry growth in the total transport volume has changed. Studying the relationship between them, taking appropriate measures, increasing transport capacity, rationally allocating transport volume, and organizing the rational flow of goods, etc., is another very important issue to ensure taking steel as the key link.

The rational distribution of productive forces can reduce the transport distance of raw materials, solve the irrational flow of goods to a certain extent, and thus maximize the rational use of transport capacity.

The Iron and Steel Industry Can Not Only Leap Forward But Also Make a Great Leap Forward

The internal transportation problem of iron and steel enterprises, with the increase in major production equipment and the improvement of production technology, the requirements for transportation are also increasing. At present, one of the internal contradictions of iron and steel enterprises is that transportation cannot keep up with the growth of the capacity of major production equipment. In this way, the exertion of the potential strength of enterprises is restricted. That is to say, there is also a certain proportional relationship objectively between the requirements for transportation between various processes within the enterprise. Studying the changes in the relationship between them, grasping the contradictions, and taking corresponding measures can fully exert the potential strength of the enterprise.

How can the iron and steel industry be considered a great leap forward? Can the iron and steel industry make a great leap forward this year?

Some people say: "Although the growth rate of the iron and steel industry has been high in the past few years, it is only due to the small base. It will not be possible in the future." Objective facts have answered this doubt. The average growth rate of steel during China's first five-year plan reached 31.7%, which is a very high rate. In 1958, it increased by 109% compared with 1957, more than doubling. The net increase of 5.83 million tons last year is also unprecedented in the history of China's iron and steel industry development.

Some people also believe: "Producing 18 million tons of steel this year means increasing 6.82 million tons more than last year, which is too much and not easy to complete." Indeed, the quantity increased this year is not small compared with last year, and the requirements for the iron and steel industry are also stricter, and the task is indeed arduous. However, there are many favorable conditions for completing the task of steel this year. First, the vast laboring masses are full of energy and have high labor enthusiasm, that is, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "They are in a good mood, have high morale, and are full of vigor"; second, there is a mass foundation for last year's great leap forward. In particular, the vast masses who participated in the iron and steel front have been tempered. They not only refined steel but also refined people. Third, last year, the basic experience of running the metallurgical industry was found, such as: walking on two legs, carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and finding a way for the whole party and the whole people to develop the iron and steel industry at high speed. Fourth, through last year's great leap forward, we have gained experience in planned and proportionate arrangements, making the relationship between various sectors of the national economy more coordinated this year; fifth, last year, the whole people engaged in steel production on a large scale, increasing a lot of ironmaking and steelmaking equipment, providing a certain material basis; sixth, there are people's communes; seventh, we started early. Last year, the iron and steel leap forward only began to be tightened after August. This year, we started to seize it from the beginning, and there are special agencies to grasp production; eighth, through last year's mass steel industry, a lot of iron and coal resources were discovered, providing the possibility for large-scale development; ninth, the policy of taking steel as the key link for the overall leap forward has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people due to the leap forward in 1958, and has become the guiding ideology of work; tenth, the leaders attach importance to it and will seize it several times a year, which will greatly promote the development of the iron and steel industry.

Therefore, the question before us is how to turn possibility into reality and grasp it tightly. What should we grasp? To sum it up, we must grasp the inherent laws between various sectors of the national economy, correctly grasp and use them to promote the development of industry; we must grasp the inherent links of the iron and steel industry, so that mines, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling can develop in proportion, and overcome various specific and effective measures for weak links; we must grasp walking on two legs and the mass line, mobilize the positive factors of all parties, and give play to enthusiasm and creativity under the unified plan and the principle of the whole country as a coordinated chess game. We believe that 18 million tons of steel this year can be completed and overfulfilled.

Adhere to the Correct Policy of Taking Steel as the Key Link for Overall Leap Forward

We say that the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an overall leap forward" is a policy for a fairly long period of time, not a temporary expedient policy. This is because China's economy is backward, the industrial foundation is weak, and to achieve socialist industrialization, without the machinery industry manufacturing various equipment, it is impossible to equip China's national economy with modern technology. The level of the machinery industry is one of the signs of the level of national industrialization. Promoting the development of the machinery industry and fully guaranteeing the metal materials it needs has become a major issue at present and for a certain period in the future. Taking steel as the key link is precisely proposed from this basic requirement. China is a large country with a large population. The existing steel per capita is lower than that of many countries. If we want to gradually change this situation, it cannot be achieved in a year or two. It requires a certain amount of time and effort. With steel, we can handle many things easily.

"Taking steel as the key link and making an overall leap forward" is the specific application of the law of planned and proportionate development. Highlighting key points and making overall arrangements does not mean that only one horse is required to take the lead, and it can be separated from ten thousand horses. On the contrary, objective requirements require one horse to take the lead, and ten thousand horses must also gallop in a corresponding manner. It is impossible to imagine that the development of the iron and steel industry can be separated from the development of departments such as coal, transportation, and the machinery industry and gallop in an uncoordinated manner. Precisely for the development of the iron and steel industry, it is necessary to develop the coal industry, the machinery industry, and the transportation industry accordingly. … It is precisely because these industrial and transportation sectors have achieved great development that they have promoted the great development of the iron and steel industry in return. This is what we often say about highlighting key points while taking care of "neighbors" and making overall arrangements. Separating from neighbors and ignoring the inherent links of various sectors of the national economy will inevitably "hasten to achieve nothing." If we ignore "taking steel as the key link" to arrange various sectors of the national economy, and mechanically put the various industrial sectors in parallel and fail to grasp the key points, it will also delay the speed of industrial development and fail to ensure the realization of key indicators, thus lacking reliable material conditions for the realization of other indicators. Taking steel as the key link for the overall leap forward is mutually dependent and mutually promoting.

To implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an overall leap forward," it is necessary to walk on two legs. Some people believe that the "small indigenous groups" have already played a historical role last year, and this year we can only rely on the "large foreign groups" to complete the task. In fact, this is not correct. This year and in the future, relying on the "large foreign groups" is the main thing, but we must also rely on the "small indigenous groups" at the same time. This year's "small indigenous groups" will gradually become "small foreign groups" after rectification, consolidation, and improvement through "five fixings and two izations." This is the law of objective things. The development of "small indigenous groups" into "small foreign groups" is a leap forward, a qualitative change. It can increase steel production and product quality, reduce costs, improve the technical level, and make more rational use of resources. Not engaging in the improvement work of "small indigenous groups" and denying their role is a one-sidedness of our way of thinking and working methods, and does not view the problem from the perspective of comprehensive development. We must fully estimate the role of small indigenous groups turning into small foreign groups, and fully utilize it to play its due role in completing 18 million tons of steel.

To implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an overall leap forward," we must adhere to the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," gather the strength of all parties, under unified leadership, divide responsibilities, strengthen cooperation, and give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties. We will then have the potential to complete and overfulfill the task. If every place and every unit only meets its own needs first, then there can be no "the whole country as a coordinated chess game," and it will be impossible to complete the national plan. Doing so is harmful. Our human, material, and financial resources are limited. Should we revive everything at once? Or should we prioritize according to the order of importance and urgency and complete the most important tasks at present? Of course, what we require is the latter rather than the former.

    以钢为纲全面跃进
    吴力永
    “以钢为纲全面跃进”的方针，是党在工业战线上目前和将来一个比较长时间的建设方针，是体现党的社会主义建设总路线有计划、按比例发展的客观规律具体化。正是由于在1958年执行了“以钢为纲”的方针，取得了伟大的成绩，钢的产量翻了一番，一年走完资本主义国家需要七年到三十二年才能走完的路程。由于钢铁工业的高速度发展，煤炭、机械、电力、化工、轻工、纺织等工业部门都得到了相应地发展，形成了“一马当先，万马奔腾”的全面跃进局面，为今年和今后打下了展开更大跃进的物质基础。这里就如何执行“以钢为纲全面跃进”和“全国一盘棋”的原则，就钢铁工业和国民经济各部门的几个比例关系，作如下的探讨。原料工业和加工工业间的关系
    原料工业和加工工业间的关系，具体说来，主要是钢铁工业和机械工业的关系。
    我国的工业过去是落后的，解放后，在党的正确领导下，几年来有了很大发展。在第一个五年计划期间，钢产量平均每年递增31.7％，机械工业产值平均每年递增34.6％。但是我国的钢铁工业和机械工业仍然是很薄弱的，远远满足不了国民经济高速度发展的要求，因此我们要求钢铁工业和机械工业都要大力发展，同时并举，而相互间要有适当的比例。只有这样，才能加速社会主义的建设，加速国民经济的技术装备，加速农业的机械化、电气化，加速交通运输的发展。正是基于大力发展机械工业的要求，那就必需充分保证机械工业以足够的原材料，换句话说，供给足够数量的钢铁材料。
    而目前金属原材料供应一般说数量和品种都还满足不了现有机械工业的要求。
    机械工业建设比较钢铁工业建设，相对的讲，来得快一些，也较容易些。钢铁工业的建设投资大，建设时间长，需要重型设备多，涉及的面广，工程复杂。比如建设一个一百万吨的钢铁厂，从开始勘探设计到建成要五、六年的时间，它不仅有地质勘探工作，矿山、选矿、烧结、耐火材料、焦炭、化工、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等主要生产部门的建设；而且有交通运输、水、电、瓦斯、蒸汽、机修等辅助服务部门约二十来个单位的建设。而机械工业，却没有地质矿山等单位，设备安装也较简单。建成一个年产二千台机床的制造工厂，只需一年左右；建成一个三万吨重型机械厂也只需要二年左右的时间。
    机械工业在一些基础比较好的地区正向“高、精、大、尖”的方向发展，对钢铁品种的要求，随着科学技术的发展而日益增多起来。以制造一台汽车为例，需要几十种钢种和几千种钢材，而这些原材料的大部分，必须有现代化的设备才能生产。
    正是由于上述原因，我们目前必需十分重视钢铁工业的发展，只有优先发展钢铁工业，才能使机械工业与冶金工业的发展相适应，才能为大力发展机械工业创造有利条件。它们之间的比例关系究竟是什么样的比例关系，这是随着国民经济发展，工农业之间的变化，轻重工业之间的变化而变化，大体上钢铁工业发展速度与机械工业发展速度近似，或者略高于机械工业的速度。如果我们能够使得钢铁工业的发展，不仅充分满足机械工业的要求，而且有储备，这样，我们许多事情都好办了。在优先发展钢铁工业的基础上，机械工业和钢铁工业同时并举的方针，事实证明是十分正确的。钢铁工业和煤炭工业间的关系
    在1958年大跃进中，突出的一个问题是煤炭工业如何与钢铁工业发展相适应的问题。也就是它们之间的比例关系问题。这里有煤炭的生产和分配问题，煤炭和钢铁生产相结合问题，以及煤种问题。
    我国是一个人口众多的国家，又是原油和天然气还不发达的国家。我们使用的燃料，煤的比重很大；煤炭的分配，在工业和农业之间，在工业的各部门之间，其中多少用于钢铁工业，是有一定比例关系的，这种比例关系，将随着工农业发展而有所变化。在农业中由于人民公社的建立，集体福利事业发展了，公社办工业发展了，人民生活水平提高了，因而用煤增加了，再加上农业的逐渐机械化，农业消耗煤炭是愈来愈多了。同样，工业的发展，对煤的需要量也在增加中。工农业都在发展，但是他们之间的比例的变化，却是工业比重逐年提高。工业比重从1953年的37.6％上升到1957年的46.9％。从工农业总产值每亿元消耗煤的变化情况来看，工业总产值每亿元消耗煤，1957年比1953年增加28％强。工农业的发展对煤的需要愈来愈大，因之，分别主次加以供应，把煤炭使用在最需要的地方，就成为当前重要的课题了。
    钢铁生产和煤的生产相结合问题，主要是煤铁生产的分布问题。随着钢铁工业的发展，从过去钢铁工业主要集中在东北、华北、上海的情况，已逐渐分布全国。特别是1958年的大跃进，钢铁生产遍布全国，目前在进行五定（定型、定组、定点、定员、定领导）二化（工业化、基地化）工作，长江以南地区，已有不少钢铁基点，但由于江南地区煤炭的发展赶不上钢铁工业的需要，这就产生了北煤南运的问题，不仅运量多，而且是长途的运输，增加了运输的负担。在长江以南地区发展钢铁工业是十分必要的，而且又有了1958年跃进的基础，困难就是煤的问题，而煤的问题又是运输问题。为了长江以南钢铁工业的发展，根据目前的情况看来，北煤可以南运一些，但满足不了大发展的要求。这就必须集中力量，在长江以南大搞煤田建设和生产的工作，可以相信，在很短的时期内，江南地区的煤炭工业，将有很大发展，为江南地区钢铁工业的发展创造有利条件。
    为了使煤、铁生产结合起来，在今后建设和目前的“五定”、“二化”工作中，必须使钢铁基地的布点，靠近煤矿和铁矿，采取就煤矿、就铁矿两头布点的方法，以便大大节省运输力。
    煤的品种问题。并不是所有的煤都能用于炼焦，只有粘结性较好和挥发分适当的煤才能炼焦。焦煤是发展钢铁工业的重要条件，目前全国焦炭产量还不能满足需要，因而，节约焦煤就是十分重要的问题。以目前情况而论，有的地方炼一吨铁消耗焦煤达七、八吨之多，而有的还不到一吨，如果能够争取以两吨焦煤炼出一吨铁来，那就要节约很多焦煤。焦煤的使用，首先应保证重点企业的需要，如鞍山钢铁公司，武汉钢铁公司等。保证了重点，然后照顾一般。为了适应今年钢铁大跃进的需要，还应考虑炼焦工业的发展，今年全国各地大搞简易炼焦炉的建设，焦炉的布点，必须考虑尽可能地同焦煤的产地相结合，考虑到交通运输、电力、水等条件，考虑到与炼铁厂的结合。如果布点不合理，不仅给今后生产带来困难，而且由于经济上的不合理，会加大生产成本。
    总之，钢铁生产和煤炭问题，是有密切联系的，没有煤就没有钢铁工业，为了钢铁工业的发展，当前必须抓紧煤炭的生产建设。特别是抓紧焦煤和洗煤的建设。钢铁工业和交通运输间的关系
    运输工作是“独立的物资生产部门”，每个生产单位离不了它，离了它，社会生产就不能进行。安排生产必须相应地安排运输，否则，运输和生产脱节，就会发生生产失调，不能正常生产，甚至使生产停工待料。
    国民经济各部门对运输的需要日益增长，运输量的增长，还赶不上工农业的增长，这就表明运输很紧张。再加上生产力的分布，有的距离原料或消费地区较远，运输问题就更为突出了。
    钢铁工业对运输的要求很大，一个钢铁联合企业，生产一吨钢，需要运输量二十二吨，其中厂内运输量达十二吨，厂外运输量十吨。生产需用的原材料靠原材料产地运来，生产出来的产品也要靠运输输送到需用部门去。
    钢铁工业对运输的要求，突出地表现在铁矿石和焦煤的运输上，每年为钢铁工业的运输量，占总运输量很大的比例。钢铁工业发展的速度比运输能力增长的速度来得快，1957年比1953年钢增加202％，而运输量只增加81％多一点。因之，钢铁对运输量的要求，在总运输量中所占的比例不能不起变化，这个变化在目前是钢铁运输量的比重越来越大了，尤其是大跃进以来，运输量的增长和国民经济的增长间的比例，钢铁工业增长占总运输量的比重起了变化，研究它们间的关系，采取适当的措施，增加运输能力，合理分配运输量，组织货源的合理流向运输等，是保证以钢为纲又一个十分重要的问题。
    生产力的合理分布，可以缩小原材料的运输距离，一定程度内解决不合理的货物流向，因而使运输能力得到最大限度的合理使用。钢铁工业不仅可以跃进而且可以大跃进
    钢铁企业内部的运输问题，随着主要生产设备增加和生产技术的改进，对运输的要求也愈来愈多了。目前，钢铁企业内部矛盾之一，就是运输跟不上主要生产设备能力的增长。这样，就使得企业潜在力量的发挥受到限制。这就是说，企业内部各工序之间，对运输的要求，也客观地存在着一定的比例关系，研究它们之间的关系变化，抓住矛盾，采取相应的措施，就能够充分发挥企业的潜在力量。
    钢铁工业如何才算大跃进？钢铁工业今年能不能大跃进？
    有的人讲：“过去几年钢铁工业增长速度虽然高，只是由于基数小的原故，以后就不可能了。”客观的事实已经回答了这个怀疑，我国第一个五年计划期间钢的增长速度平均达到31.7％，这个速度是很高的。1958年比1957年却增长109％，增加一倍还多。去年一年净增五百八十三万吨，在我国钢铁工业发展史来说也还是史无前例的。
    也有人认为：“今年生产一千八百万吨钢，就是说比去年再增加六百八十二万吨增加得太多，不容易完成。”的确，今年比去年增加的数量不少，同时对钢铁工业的要求也严格了，任务确是艰巨的。但是，今年完成钢的任务有许多有利的条件，一是广大的劳动群众的干劲十足，劳动热情很高，也就是毛主席指出的：“心情舒畅，斗志昂扬，意气风发”；二是有了去年大跃进的群众基础，特别是参加钢铁战线的广大群众受到了锻炼，不仅炼了钢，也炼了人。三是去年找到了办冶金工业的基本经验，如：用两条腿走路，大搞群众运动，找到了全党全民高速度发展钢铁工业的道路，四是经过去年大跃进，我们取得了有计划按比例安排的经验，使得今年国民经济各部门之间的关系更加协调了；五是去年全民大搞钢铁，增加了不少的炼铁、炼钢的设备，有一定的物质基础；六是有了人民公社；七是抓得早，去年钢铁跃进只是8月以后才开始抓紧，今年一开始就抓，而且有专门机构抓生产；八是经过去年群众大搞钢铁工业，发现了不少铁煤资源，提供了大发展的可能；九是以钢为纲全面跃进的方针由于1958年的跃进，更加深入人心，成为工作的主导思想；十是领导重视，一年要抓几次，这会大大推动钢铁工业的发展。
    因此，摆在我们面前的问题是如何把可能变为现实，紧紧地抓起来的问题。要抓一些什么呢？概括一些说，要抓国民经济各部门之间的内在规律性，正确地掌握和运用它，促进工业的发展；要抓钢铁工业内在的联系，使矿山、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢间按比例发展，克服其中薄弱环节的各种具体有力的措施；要抓两条腿走路和群众路线，调动各方面的积极因素，在统一的计划，全国一盘棋的原则下，发挥积极性创造性。我们相信，今年一千八百万吨钢是可以完成和超额完成的。坚持以钢为纲全面跃进的正确方针
    我们说“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针是相当长时期的方针，不是一时权宜的方针，这是由于我国经济落后，工业基础薄弱，要社会主义工业化，没有机械工业制造各种各样的设备，不可能将我国国民经济用现代化的技术装备起来。机械工业水平的高或低，是国家工业化水平的标志之一。促进机械工业的发展，充分保证其所需的金属材料，已成为当前和今后一定时期主要的问题。以钢为纲正是从这一基本要求提出来的。我国是一个大国，人口众多，现有的一点钢按人口平均低于很多国家，如果我们要逐步改变这种情况，不是一年两年能搞起来的，要有一定时间的努力，有了钢铁，我们有许多事情就好办了。
    “以钢为纲，全面跃进”是有计划按比例发展的规律的具体运用。突出重点，全面安排，这并不是说只要求一马当先，可以脱离万马。恰恰相反，客观要求一马当先，万马也要相适应地奔腾。不可能设想，钢铁工业的发展可以脱离煤炭、交通运输、机械工业等部门的发展而不相适应地奔腾起来。正是为了钢铁工业的发展，必须相应发展煤炭工业、机械工业、交通运输事业。……正是这些工业和交通部门得到了大发展，返回来就促进了钢铁工业的大发展，这就是我们常常说的突出重点同时要照顾到“左邻右舍”全面加以安排。脱离左邻右舍，忽视国民经济各部门的内在联系，必然“欲速不达”。如果忽视“以钢为纲”来安排国民经济各部门，而把各工业部门机械地平列起来，抓不住重点，也将延缓工业发展速度，不能确保重点指标的实现，从而其他指标的实现也缺乏可靠的物质条件。以钢为纲全面跃进是互为依赖的，互相促进的。
    贯彻“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，必需两条腿走路。有的人认为“小土群”去年已经起了历史的作用，今年只依靠“大洋群”就能完成任务了。其实这是不正确的。在今年和今后要依靠“大洋群”这是主要的，同时也要依靠“小土群”。今年的“小土群”经过“五定二化”整顿、巩固、提高以后，将逐步成为“小洋群”，这是客观事物发展的规律。“小土群”发展成为“小洋群”，这是一个跃进，质的变化。它可以提高钢铁产量和产品质量，降低成本，提高技术水平，使资源得到较合理的利用。不搞“小土群”的提高工作，否认其作用，这是我们思想方法和工作方法的片面性，不是从全面发展的观点去看问题。我们必须充分估计小土群转为小洋群的作用，充分的利用它为完成一千八百万吨钢而发挥其应有的作用。
    贯彻“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，必须坚持“全国一盘棋”的原则，集合各方面的力量，在统一的领导下，分工负责，加强协作，充分发挥各方面的积极性，我们就有可能完成和超额完成任务。如果每个地方，各个单位，都只按自己的需要先满足自己的要求，那就不可能有“全国一盘棋”，就不可能完成国家计划。这样作是有害的。我们的人力物力财力有限，是百废俱兴呢？还是分别轻重缓急排队，完成当前最主要的任务呢？当然我们要求的是后者而不是前者。
