    Belief and Doubt
    Jiang Yan

    Belief and doubt are important attitudes in the pursuit of truth. When learning, we must humbly accept the experiences of our predecessors, be brave enough to acknowledge and practice them, and also boldly doubt, discovering their shortcomings or inaccuracies. When expressing our own opinions, we must believe that they are correct, that they are insights based on our own thinking and have a certain basis, and also doubt that they may have shortcomings or inaccuracies, requiring others or practice to test them. Only believing and not doubting will lead to the mistakes of "reading without seeking thorough understanding" or "stubbornly adhering to one's own views," while only doubting and not believing will lead to confusion and indecision.

    There are people who don't seek thorough understanding when learning, disregarding truth and falsehood entirely, and when expressing their own opinions, they always think they have thought it through, so they don't listen to others' opinions. This attitude is extremely harmful. Such people find it difficult to learn real knowledge and difficult to do their jobs well.

    信与疑
    江延
    信与疑，是追求真理的一个重要态度。在学习的时候，既要虚心接受前人的经验，勇于承认它和实践它，又要大胆怀疑，发现它的不足或不是。在发表自己的意见时，既要相信它是正确的，是经过自己一番思考有一定根据的见解，又要怀疑它可能有不足或不是的地方，需要别人或实践来检验。只信不疑，就要犯“读书不求甚解”或“固执己见”的错误，只疑不信，便要搞的是非不明，莫衷一是。
    有这样的人，学习时不求甚解，真理与谬误全然不管，发表自己的意见时总认为自己已经想过，就不倾听别人意见。这种态度都是极为有害的，这样的人很难学到真正的知识，很难把工作做好。
