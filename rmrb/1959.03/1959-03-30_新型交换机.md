    New Type of Switchboard

    The workers of the China Automatic Telecommunications Equipment Factory have designed and manufactured a new type of switchboard. It is simple in structure and saves labor and materials.

    The new switchboard is common-battery type, suitable for urban use. It is only about the size of three ordinary foreign typewriters, with twenty internal extensions and four external lines, allowing six pairs of telephones to talk simultaneously. If the using unit finds the number of telephones insufficient, it can be increased as needed. This type of switchboard can also be used to hold small telephone conferences.

    This new type of switchboard was jointly trial-produced by electricians Xu Rongsen, Li Shiming, Mi Changsheng, Hong Benfang, and others from the China Automatic Telecommunications Equipment Factory. They only spent eight days to make this new reform. (Attached picture)

    新型交换机
    中国自动电讯器材厂的工人设计制造了一种新型的交换机。它结构简单，省工省料。
    新交换机是共电式的，适宜城市使用。它只有三架普通的外文打字机那么大，二十门内部分机和四条外线，可供六对电话机同时通话。如果使用单位嫌话机不够，也可根据需要增加。用这种交换机，还可以举行小型的电话会议。
    这种新型交换机是中国自动电讯器材厂的电工许荣森、李世铭、宓长升、洪本芳等人合作试制的。他们仅用八天时间就作了这一新的改革。（附图片）
