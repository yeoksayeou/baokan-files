    Hoping for Annotations When Quoting Ancient Books
    After reading the ideological commentary "Reviewing the Old to Know the New" on the seventh page of the March 17th issue, I felt it was very good. However, some of the words and sentences from the ancient book quotations in the article are very difficult to understand, and I cannot interpret and comprehend them well. I have encountered similar difficulties before when reading articles in the People's Daily and other newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, I hope that when authors quote ancient books, they will provide brief annotations or explanations of difficult words and sentences. This would be very helpful for us young people.

    引用古籍希望作点注释
    读了3月17日第七版上“温故而知新”这篇思想评论，觉得很好。可是，文章里有一些古书引语的词和句很不易懂，我不能很好地解释和领会。我以前读人民日报及其他报刊上的一些文章，也曾碰到过这样的困难。因此，希望作者们引用古籍时，对艰深的词句作点简明的注释或解释。这对我们青年人是很有帮助的。
