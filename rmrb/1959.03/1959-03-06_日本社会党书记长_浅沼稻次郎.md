Personage Introduction

    Japanese Socialist Party Secretary General
    Inejirō Asanuma
    Inejirō Asanuma, head of the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, who is visiting our country again for a friendly visit, is a famous Japanese political activist and current Secretary General of the Japanese Socialist Party.
    Inejirō Asanuma was born in 1898 in Tokyo. In 1923, he graduated from the Department of Politics at Waseda University in Tokyo. During his time at school, he began to participate in the labor movement and joined the early socialist research groups "Builders Alliance" and "Gyomin Society." After graduating from school, he joined the miners' union and participated in the famous Ashio copper mine strike at that time, for which he was arrested and imprisoned for five months.
    In 1925, he served as the secretary general of the Japan Farmers' Party. The following year, he served as a founding member of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party. Later, he served as a standing central committee member of the National Labor-Farmer Masses Party and the organization minister of the Social Masses Party.
    After the war, in 1946, he served as a standing central executive committee member and organization minister of the Japan Socialist Party. The following year, he became secretary general. After the split of the Japanese Socialist Party in 1951, he served as secretary general of the Right-wing Socialist Party. When the left and right wings of the Socialist Party merged in October 1955, he became the secretary general of the Socialist Party again until now.
    Since 1936, Inejirō Asanuma has been elected as a member of the House of Representatives many times. Prior to this, he was also elected as a member of the Tokyo City Council twice and served as the vice chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.
    The Chinese people are familiar with Inejirō Asanuma. In April 1957, Asanuma led the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China for a visit and issued a joint statement with Zhang Xiruo, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, making positive efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and the normalization of relations between the two countries. During his visit to China, Asanuma expressed the position of the Japanese Socialist Party: it does not recognize "two Chinas," there is only one China, Taiwan is a part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, which should be resolved by China itself.
    Regarding Japan's foreign policy, Asanuma advocates that Japan should revise its foreign policy of following the United States and implement an independent and autonomous foreign policy. In a statement he made during his last visit to China, he said that the Japanese people unanimously demanded absolute opposition to atomic and hydrogen bombs and opposition to war. The Japanese people demand to get rid of American military rule, not to participate in any camp, to carry out independent and autonomous diplomacy, to strengthen cooperation with China, Asia and Africa, and to expand the area of ​​peace. The Japanese people demand that trade and economic exchanges be developed with China and Southeast Asian countries. The Japanese people demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Japan and Asia, and the abolition of military bases. After Nobusuke Kishi violated the will of the Japanese people, undermined the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, and took a series of actions hostile to China and undermined Sino-Japanese friendly relations in April last year, Asanuma once pointed out in his statement that the Japanese government's hostile attitude towards China in its foreign policy was the cause of Sino-Japanese disputes. He also proposed that the Japanese government should recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as soon as possible and establish friendly relations with China.
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China led by Inejirō Asanuma to visit China again for a friendly visit. We believe that their visit will contribute to enhancing the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and to promoting the just cause of the Japanese people to strengthen unity, get rid of foreign control and strive for Japan's independence and autonomy.

    1925年，他担任日本农民党的书记长。次年任日本劳农党创立委员，后来历任全国劳农大众党的常任中央委员和社会大众党的组织部长等职。
    战后，1946年，他担任了日本社会党常任中央执行委员兼组织部长。次年任书记长。1951年，日本社会党发生分裂以后，他担任右派社会党书记长。1955年10月，左右两派社会党合并时，他又任社会党书记长直到现在。
    从1936年以来，浅沼稻次郎曾多次当选为众议院议员。在这以前，他还两次当选为东京市议会议员，并担任过东京都议会的副议长。
    中国人民是熟识浅沼稻次郎的。1957年4月间，浅沼曾率领日本社会党访华亲善使节团来我国访问，并同中国人民外交学会会长张奚若发表了共同声明，对促进中日友好和两国关系正常化，作了积极的努力。浅沼在访华期间，表达了日本社会党的立场：不承认“两个中国”，中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分，台湾问题是中国内部问题，应由中国自己来解决。
    对于日本的外交政策，浅沼主张，日本应该修改追随美国的外交政策，实行独立自主的外交。他在上次访华期间发表的谈话中说，日本人民一致要求绝对反对原子弹、氢弹，反对战争。日本人民要求摆脱美国的军事统治，不参加任何阵营，进行独立自主的外交，加强和中国、亚非各国的合作，扩大和平区域。日本国民要求和中国以及东南亚各国发展贸易经济往来。日本国民要求撤退在日本和亚洲的外国军队，取消军事基地。去年4月间岸信介违反日本人民的意志，破坏第四次中日贸易协定，并且采取了一系列敌视中国的行动，破坏中日友好关系后，浅沼曾经在他发表的谈话中指出：日本政府在外交方针方面采取着敌视中国的态度，是造成中日纠纷的原因。他并提出，日本政府应该尽快承认中华人民共和国政府，并且同中国建立友好关系。
    中国人民热烈欢迎浅沼稻次郎率领的社会党访华亲善使节团再次来华进行友好访问。我们相信他们的访问对于增进中日两国人民的友好关系，对于促进日本人民加强团结摆脱外国控制、争取日本独立自主的正义事业，作出贡献。（新华社）
