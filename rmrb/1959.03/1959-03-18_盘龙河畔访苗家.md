Visiting Miao Homes on the Banks of the Panlong River
By our reporter Wang Chuanguo

"Miao people squat on the mountain tops, Zhuang people occupy the waterfront, and Han people dominate the streets."
This is a well-known saying in the border areas of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, and it is a true reflection of the old ethnic distribution and ethnic relations at that time. Today, times have changed, and ethnic relations have also completely changed. In this place where ethnic groups were deeply divided and alienated from each other, it is now difficult to find Miao people on the mountain tops. They have all moved to the rich plains, riverbanks, or bustling streets and towns.

In the first spring after the people's communes were established, I came to the Wenshan area in the southeastern corner of Yunnan. On the banks of the Panlong River, I visited more than a dozen newly relocated Miao villages and saw many Miao people who had just moved from the high-altitude cold mountains and primitive old forests, working together with their Zhuang and Han brothers to build a socialist big family. They have transformed the mountain slopes into pastures and forestry bases, and turned the fertile land on the banks of the Panlong River into double-cropping rice, cotton, and sugarcane areas. The good natural conditions of the plains are being fully utilized, and the "slash-and-burn" cultivation and steep slope reclamation in the mountainous areas have also been eradicated. Production has been comprehensively developed, and ethnic relations have been completely changed. In the common labor, they have forged new ethnic friendships.

Hongyu Village is one of the newly emerging villages on the banks of the Panlong River. Originally, only a few Han families lived here. Sixty or seventy Miao-style thatched houses, common in the mountains in the past, are lined up south of the Han residences. The village is surrounded by paddy fields and sugarcane gardens. These days, people are busy with spring plowing and manure accumulation, and the village seems quiet. I walked out of the south of the village and came to the place where manure is being accumulated, where people are using weeds, human and animal manure to make high-temperature compost. The noise of people is overwhelming, and smoke is billowing. For generations, the Miao people have never fertilized the land. Today, however, their enthusiasm for accumulating manure is as great as that of the Han commune members. This is the first time that double-cropping rice and various technical crops are being grown on a large scale in the坝子(plains), and the need for fertilizer is many times greater than in previous years. All the Miao commune members, like other ethnic commune members, are determined to complete the target of applying 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

On a morning in February in Hongyu Village, sowing has already begun. I followed the sowing people to the fields. Among the seven or eight people sowing seeds, there were also Miao commune members who had just come down from the mountains. Tao Wanming, who was participating in rice sowing for the first time in his life, was particularly excited today, and his wish for decades has finally been realized. "Ravens have no tree stumps, Miao people have no place." This old poor peasant, who is nearly half a century old, spoke out this sentence first. Since he was a child, he lived in the high mountains behind this Xishan Mountain. Every year, he dug through the entire mountain to plant a few dan of corn and buckwheat in the cracks of the rocks, and as a result, he had to give most of it to the Han landlords in the city. In the best years, it was considered good if each of his ten family members could have a bowl of corn noodles mixed with pumpkin leaves and wild vegetable soup per meal. Sometimes he thought: If I could open up more wasteland and accumulate more grain, it would be great if I could buy two pieces of land one day. But the hoe could never outsmart the landlord's abacus. Dig, dig! I don't know how many hoes were worn out, but life was still the same as before. Everything only completely changed after the Liberation Army came here. With the improvement of ethnic relations, the Miao people also often went down to the坝子(plains). Last winter, after the mountainous areas and the坝子(plains) formed a unified people's commune, the Zhuang and Han people warmly welcomed the Miao people to move to the坝子(plains). Tao Wanming was the first to take the lead in moving down from their mountain village. Now, he is really sowing rice at the foot of this Xishan Mountain.

The material basis for the ethnic segregation for thousands of years no longer exists. Today, the spiritual impact it has on people is also quickly disappearing. Li Zhengfa, a Miao commune member in Hongyan Village, had various concerns before moving. The couple discussed it many times. Hongyan Village is all Zhuang people, and the new house has not yet been built. If they move to a Zhuang family, would they like it? This matter of moving made them both happy and worried. What should they do? In the end, they decided to move down to try, and if it didn't work, they would move back. Who knew that it would be completely different after they came down. Zhuang commune member Wang Mingchong gave half of his house to him, and he specially repaired it in advance, and even rammed the ground again. On the day of the move, the Zhuang people in Hongyan Village ran more than ten miles to welcome them, helping to carry furniture and move things. Now, in addition to going out to work during the day, the Li and Wang families always help each other take care of chickens and ducks, and take care of the children when they are at home. The women also learn needlework, weaving straw sandals, and culture together. They have simply become a family.

In the process of eating, living, and working together, ethnic commune members have more opportunities to understand and learn from each other. Everyone learns from each other's strengths and makes up for their weaknesses, promoting each other, and all have improved quickly. At the same time, they also respect and take care of the customs of each ethnic group, and fully exert their respective strengths. In the past, the Miao people had no experience in growing paddy fields, and the women had never been in paddy fields. But in Hongyu Village, I saw several Miao women and Han women working together to harrow paddy fields. The big water buffalo dragged the iron-toothed harrow around in the fields. The clever Miao women stood on the harrow and operated freely. The mud splashed on the "hundred-pleated skirt" that swayed from side to side, and they hummed mountain songs from time to time. When they first moved down, how envious they were when they saw that women of other ethnic groups could plow and harrow the fields! They thought: Others can do it, can I learn it? As a result, with the enthusiastic help of Han women, they studied hard and practiced diligently, and learned it in no time. The pig farm of the Hongyu Village production team raises more than 100 fat pigs and sows, as well as a large group of piglets. The feeders are all Miao women. This team did not raise many pigs in the past, because the Han and Zhuang people here have very poor pig-raising experience, and they have no habit of raising sows. When the Miao commune members came down the mountain, several Miao women were specially selected to raise pigs. As a result, the number of sows increased, the management was meticulous, and the big and small pigs grew quickly and well, making this team a banner for pig raising in the entire commune.

The united Miao, Zhuang, and Han people have unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, and the spring plowing production on both sides of the Panlong River is in full swing. This year, they are preparing for a bigger leap forward, and the total income is expected to double by another half compared to last year. Starting this year, the mountainous areas are becoming "cattle and sheep all over the slopes, flowers and fruits all over the mountains."

One day, I spent a commune holiday with the commune members of Hongyan Village. On the holiday, the village boiled over. A large group of people were watching a Miao youth "dancing the lusheng." He sometimes spins, sometimes somersaults, and the melodious singing is gentle and moving, attracting all the Zhuang audience. The Zhuang people's favorite dance "Jumping Paper Horse" also took the stage. The performers were six old women who were all dressed in ancient costumes. They danced to the rhythm of a slow "gong" sound, and two colorful paper horses also galloped left and right with the graceful dance. In the climax of joy, Ma Guizhen, a 64-year-old Zhuang mother, put on a monkey mask that children play with and ran to the field to dance the old monkey. Then, Wang Youfu, an old Miao man, also greeted him empty-handed. These two old people of different ethnic groups, one male and one female, chased and played with each other. The Miao and Zhuang people couldn't help themselves, and the sound of lusheng, gongs, and laughter rippled for a long time on the banks of the Panlong River... (Attached picture)
The Hongqi People's Commune in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province, is composed of four ethnic groups: Zhuang, Miao, Yi, and Han. The commune has made unified arrangements for the development of the坝区(plains) and mountainous areas. The four ethnic groups cooperate in unity, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for their weaknesses in a commune, and develop together. The picture above shows the newly built Miao village in Hongqi Commune. A large number of Miao commune members have moved here from the high-altitude cold mountains.

    盘龙河畔访苗家
    本报记者　王传国
    “苗家蹲山头，僮族占水头，汉人霸街头”
    这是滇、桂、黔边区人人皆知的一句话，它也是对这里旧的民族分布和那时的民族关系的真实写照。如今，时代变了，民族关系也全变了。就在这个各民族彼此分裂、隔阂极深的地方，山头上已很难见到苗人，他们都迁到那富饶的平坝里，河岸边，或繁华的街镇上了。
    人民公社化后的第一个春天，记者来到了滇东南角的文山地区。在盘龙河畔，我访问了十多个新出山的苗族村寨，见到了很多刚从高寒山区和原始老林搬来的苗族人民正同僮族、汉族兄弟一道，积极地在建设社会主义的大家庭。他们将山坡改作了牧场和林业基地，把盘龙河岸的沃土变成了双季稻、棉花和甘蔗区，平坝的良好自然条件正在充分利用，山区也根除了“刀耕火种”和陡坡开荒。生产全面大发展了，民族关系也全改观了。在共同的劳动中，已使他们结下了新的民族友谊。
    红鱼村是盘龙河畔新出现的村庄之一。原来只有几家汉人在这里居住。六七十户过去在山头上常见的苗式草房，就排在汉族住宅的南边。村子周围是一片水田和甘蔗园。这几天，人们都忙春耕和积肥去了，村里显得静悄悄的。我走出村南，来到了生产积肥的地方，人们正在用杂草、人畜粪制造高温堆肥。人声鼎沸，烟雾腾腾。苗族种地世世代代是不施肥的，今天积肥的劲头却和汉族社员一样大，坝子里又是头次大种双季稻和各种技术作物，需要的肥料比往年多好几倍。所有的苗族社员都和其他民族社员一样，决心要完成每亩施肥三万至五万斤的指标。
    在红鱼村的2月的一个早晨，这里已开始播种了。我随着播种的人们来到田间，在七八个撒种的人里，也有刚下山的苗族社员。生平头次参加播稻种的陶万明，今天特别兴奋，几十年来的愿望终于实现了。“老鸦无树桩，苗人无地方”。这位年近半百的老贫农一开口就先讲出了这句话。从小他就住在这西山背后的大山上。每年挖遍全山，才能在那石缝中种出几担包谷和荞麦来，结果还要把大部分交给城里的汉族地主。最好年景，全家十口人每顿能有一碗包谷面拌南瓜叶和野菜汤喝就算不错了。有时也想：多开些荒地，多积点粮食，到那一天能买上两块田就好了。但锄头总挖不过地主老爷的算盘，挖呀，挖呀！锄头不知磨坏了多少把，日子依然和从前一样。自从解放大军来到这里以后，一切才完全变样了。随着民族关系的改善，苗族也经常下坝了。去年冬天，山区和坝区组成了统一的人民公社后，僮族和汉族都热烈欢迎苗族搬到坝子里来。陶万明就是他们山寨中第一个带头搬下来的。如今，他真的在这西山脚下播上稻子了。
    千年万代民族隔阂的物质基础早没有了。今天它留给人们精神上的影响也正在很快地消失着。红岩村苗族社员李正发，搬家前还有种种顾虑，夫妻俩曾多次商量，红岩村全是僮族，新房子又未盖起来，要是搬在僮族家里，他们喜欢吗？搬家这事使他们又高兴，又耽心。怎么办呢？最后确定搬下来试试，不行再搬回去。谁知下来后竟是另一个样子。僮族社员王明充把自己的房子让了一半给他住，事先还专门作了修理，连地也重新捶整了一次。搬家那天，红岩村的僮族群众跑到十多里外去迎接，帮助抬家具，搬东西。现在李王两家除白天出去劳动外，在家时总互相帮助照料鸡、鸭，领娃娃，妇女们还一道学针线、学织草鞋、学文化、简直变成了一家人。
    在同吃、同住、同劳动过程中，各民族社员彼此了解和学习的机会多了，大家取长补短，互相促进，都很快得到了提高。同时，又互相尊重、照顾各民族习惯，也充分发挥了各自的特长。苗族人民过去没有种水田的经验，妇女们从来没有下过水田。但在红鱼村，我却见到了几个苗族妇女和汉族妇女一道，正在耙水田。大水牛拖着铁齿耙在田里兜圈，机灵的苗族妇女立在耙上操作自如，泥水溅湿了那左右飘动的“百折裙”，嘴里还不时哼着山歌。刚搬下来的那几天，当他们看到其他民族妇女都会犁田、耙田时，内心里是多么羡慕啊！心想：别人都会，自己能不能学会呢？结果，在汉族妇女热心的帮助下，自己勤学苦练，没好久就学会了。红鱼村生产队的养猪场，养着一百多头肥猪和母猪，还有一大群小猪娃，饲养员全是苗族妇女。这个队原来养猪也不多，因为这里的汉族和僮族养猪经验都很差，更没有养母猪的习惯。当苗族社员下山后，专门抽出了几个苗族妇女养猪。结果，增加了母猪，管理细致了，大小猪都长得又快又好，使这个队成为全公社养猪的旗帜。
    团结起来的苗人、僮人和汉人，革命干劲空前高涨，盘龙河两岸的春耕生产闹得热火朝天。今年准备来个更大的跃进，总收入要比去年再翻一番半。从今年开始，山区正在变成“遍坡牛羊，满山花果”。
    一天，我和红岩村社员共度了公社休息日。在休假日里，村中沸腾起来了。一大群人在看一个苗族青年“跳芦笙”，他时而旋转，时而翻滚，悠扬的歌声娓婉动人，把所有僮族观众都吸引住了。僮族喜爱的舞蹈“跳纸马”也上场了，表演者是六个年已半百的老妈妈，个个都是一派古老的打扮。她们迎着一阵缓缓的“铓锣”声起舞，两匹彩色纸马也随着翩翩的舞姿左右奔腾。在欢乐的高潮里，六十四岁的僮族大妈妈马贵珍便带上孩子们玩的猴子面具，跑到场中跳起老猴来了。接着，苗族王有福老大爹也空手迎了上去。这两个不同民族的老人，一男一女，在一起互相追逐，嬉戏。苗人、僮人情不自禁，盘龙河畔长久荡漾着芦笙、铓锣声和欢笑声……。（附图片）
    云南省文山县红旗人民公社，是由僮、苗、彝、汉四个民族组成的。公社对坝区和山区的发展作了统一安排。四个民族在一个公社里团结合作，互相学习，取长补短，共同发展。上图为红旗社新建的苗族村庄，大批的苗族社员从高寒山区搬到这里。
