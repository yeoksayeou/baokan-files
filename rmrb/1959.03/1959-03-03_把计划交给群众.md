    Hand the Plan Over to the Masses
    Li Qin-yuan
    Currently, many people's communes are formulating their production plans for this year. This is also an important part of the spring plowing preparation work. How can we do this work well? The correct approach is to hand the production plan over to the masses, mobilize the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, big debates, and writing of big-character posters to discuss the feasibility of achieving the plan and specific measures. This can enable the masses to recognize the favorable conditions and specific methods for achieving the plan, as well as see the difficulties in implementing the plan and find ways to overcome them, boosting their morale sufficiently to fight wholeheartedly to complete the plan. In the discussion process, widely absorbing the correct opinions of the masses can make the plan more complete and reliable. Doing so will allow the plan to take root in every piece of land and in every commune member. The Sanyang People's Commune in Pingjiang, Hunan, is doing just that. This approach is worth promoting.
    Some comrades believe that the Great Leap Forward last year has already liberated the minds of the masses, and they believe that what the Communist Party says will not be wrong, so there is no need to mobilize them so earnestly anymore; the masses will work with full steam ahead. It is correct to say that the masses, encouraged by the Great Leap Forward last year, have even more confidence in striving for a greater leap forward this year. However, people's understanding often lags behind objective reality. What we want to strive for this year is a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than last year. In this struggle, we have many favorable conditions sufficient to guarantee victory. At the same time, some difficulties will also arise on our path forward. All these favorable and difficult conditions should be clearly understood by every commune member. If the masses do not see the favorable conditions, it will be difficult to improve their confidence; if they do not see the difficulties and are not prepared to overcome them, their confidence and determination may also waver when they encounter difficulties. Handing over the plan and measures item by item to the masses for discussion and modification, and fully exposing contradictions and recognizing the methods to resolve contradictions in the discussion, can greatly improve the masses' awareness and level of understanding, and greatly enhance the masses' confidence and determination in a greater leap forward.
    Last year, many places precisely mobilized the masses, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and boosted the masses' soaring enthusiasm in the process of formulating and revising production plans, which led to the fruits of a great harvest. We must remember this experience.

### 把计划交给群众

    把计划交给群众
    李沁源
    现在，许多人民公社正在制订今年的生产计划。这也是备耕工作的一个重要部分。怎样才能把这个工作做好呢？正确的作法，是把生产计划交给群众，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，出大字报，讨论实现计划的可能性和具体措施。这样可以使群众认识到实现计划的有利条件和具体做法，也看到执行计划的困难，找到克服困难的办法，劲鼓得足足的，同心协力为完成计划而斗争。在讨论过程中，广泛吸取群众正确的意见，可以使计划订得更完满，更可靠。这样做，就能使计划在每块土地上和每个社员身上落脚生根。湖南平江三阳公社正是这样做的。这种作法值得提倡。
    有些同志认为，去年大跃进了，群众思想已经解放了，他们相信共产党讲的话不会错，无需再那么认真地去发动，群众就会一股劲地去干。说群众在去年大跃进的鼓舞下，对争取今年更大跃进的信心更足，这是对的。但是，人的认识往往落后于客观实际。我们今年要争取的是比去年更大更好更全面的跃进。在这个斗争中，我们有许多有利条件，足以保证取得胜利。同时，在我们前进的道路上也会出现一些困难。所有这一切有利的和困难的条件，都应该让每一个社员清楚地了解。群众看不到有利条件，信心就很难提高；看不到困难，没有克服困难的准备，一碰上困难，信心和决心也可能动摇。把计划和措施项项都交群众讨论、修改，在讨论中，充分地揭露矛盾，认识解决矛盾的办法，就可以大大提高群众觉悟和认识水平，大大增强群众对更大跃进的信心和决心。
    去年，许多地方正是在制订和修订生产计划的过程中，发动了群众，批判了右倾保守思想，鼓足了群众的冲天干劲，才取得了大丰收的果实。我们必须记住这一条经验。
