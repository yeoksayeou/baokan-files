Liaoning Rectifies and Improves Small-Scale Native Power Stations

(Our Dispatch) Liaoning Province's vigorous mass movement for electricity generation is beginning to develop from "small-scale native groups" to "small-scale foreign groups." Various localities are systematically and with leadership rectifying and improving small-scale native power stations, and many enterprises are vigorously developing small-scale foreign self-supplied power stations.

In order to ensure an overall leap forward with steel as the key link, Liaoning Province, in addition to actively building large-scale foreign power stations, launched a mass movement focused on establishing small-scale native power stations starting in September last year. Many units have achieved electricity self-sufficiency, and some have even supported fraternal units with surplus electricity. This has played a significant role in ensuring the great leap forward in industrial production throughout the province. In the mass electricity generation movement, the masses created more than forty methods for generating and substituting electricity, and they manufactured a large number of native boilers, native steam turbines, and native generators themselves. Industrial wastewater and wind power from flues, which had never been utilized before, have been used for power generation. The Anshan Hotel even successfully used the residual heat from cooking stoves to generate electricity. Many units combine power generation with heating, using heating boilers for power generation. The Shenyang Bicycle Factory used the steam generated during the separation of water and oil to drive six 75-kilowatt steam turbines for power generation. Anshan city has constructed many small square furnaces, which can not only use their coal gas for power generation but also provide coking coal needed for steelmaking, and can also extract many by-products from coal tar. Currently, a mass movement centered on technological revolution to consolidate and improve small-scale native power stations is gradually unfolding in various cities throughout the province. Various localities have established technology rooms or technology groups to study and solve how to improve the output, efficiency, and sustained operation of boilers, steam turbines, and generators. Two native generators at the Xinqiu Coal Preparation Plant of the Fuxin Coal Mine were damaged during operation due to overspeed rotation. The leadership mobilized the masses to create an electric emergency safety device that is simple to manufacture and does not require special materials, solving the problem of safe operation. Fuxin City is using this experience to install this safety device on all existing native generators. Benxi City is adopting methods such as short-term training, holding on-site meetings, and piloting to increase the output of various power equipment such as native turbines and internal combustion engines.

In order to further meet the electricity needs of a greater leap forward in production, many units are actively building small-scale foreign self-supplied power stations based on the technical and organizational experience they have already gained in electricity generation. During the construction process, employees are exerting sky-high efforts, adopting methods such as combining native and foreign techniques and substituting materials to overcome technical and material barriers. The Shenyang Signal Factory, Bridge Factory, and three other units are collaborating to build a 1,600-kilowatt small-scale foreign power station. Machining steam turbine blades requires dozens of specialized precision machine tools in professional steam turbine factories, but the workers of Dalian Shipyard used their own specially manufactured native machine tools for processing blades and also made foreign power equipment. When processing steam turbine blades, Dalian Porcelain Factory did not have a milling machine, so they made a mold to mill them on a lathe. Without a polishing machine, they used a grinding wheel to polish them. Without a crane, they built an iron frame to replace it. Finally, they successfully trial-produced a 250-kilowatt steam turbine. Recently, many units in Shenyang have been cooperating to establish joint self-supplied power stations, gradually forming regional self-supplied power grids. (Attached picture)

Workers in the Light Oil Workshop of Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 used waste materials to make a native turbine. This native turbine is small in size and consumes less power, but can generate 190 kilowatts of electricity, which can not only meet the electricity needs of the workshop but also support other workshops.

    辽宁整顿提高小土电站
    本报讯　辽宁省轰轰烈烈的群众性的办电运动开始由“小土群”向“小洋群”发展，各地正在有计划有领导地整顿和提高小土电站，许多企业都在大搞小洋的自备电站。
    辽宁省为了保证以钢为纲的全面跃进，除积极建设大洋电站以外，从去年9月开始，掀起了一个以兴办小土电站为主的群众性的办电运动。很多单位做到电力自给，有的还在自给之余支援兄弟单位。这对保证全省工业生产大跃进起了很大作用。在群众性的办电运动中，群众创造的发电、代电的办法有四十多种，群众自己动手制造了大量的土锅炉、土汽轮机和土发电机。从来没有被利用过的工业废水、烟道的风力等都被用来发电了。鞍山饭店还利用炒菜炉灶余热发电成功。许多单位把发电和取暖结合起来，用暖气锅炉发电。沈阳自行车厂利用水和油分离过程中产生的蒸汽，带动了六台七十五瓩的汽轮机发电。安东市建设了许多小方型炉，既能利用它的煤气发电，又能提供炼钢所需的焦煤，还可以从焦油中提炼出许多种副产品。目前，一个以技术革命为中心的巩固、提高小土电站的群众运动，正在全省各市逐步展开。各地都成立技术室或技术小组，研究和解决如何提高锅炉、汽轮机、发电机的出力、效率和持久运行等问题。阜新煤矿新丘选煤厂曾有两台土发电机因过速旋转，在运行中甩坏了，领导方面便发动群众创造出制造简便、不用特殊材料的电动危急保安器，解决了安全运行问题。阜新市正根据这个经验把现有的土发电机都装上这种保安设备。本溪市采取短期训练、开现场会议和试点的办法，提高土透平、内燃机等各种电力设备的出力。
    为了进一步满足生产更大跃进用电的需要，很多单位都在已经取得的办电技术经验和组织经验的基础上，积极建设小洋自备电站。在建站过程中，职工们发挥冲天干劲，采取土洋结合、材料代用等办法，大破技术关和材料关。沈阳信号厂、桥梁厂等五个单位互相协作，正在建设一千六百瓩的小洋电站。加工汽轮机叶片，在专业性的汽轮机厂需要几十台专用的精密机床，可是大连造船厂职工们使用自己制造的专门加工叶片的土机床，也做出了洋发电设备。大连电瓷厂加工汽轮机叶片时，没有铣床就自制胎具在车床上铣制，没有抛光机就用砂轮打光，没有吊车就打起铁架子代替，终于试制成功二百五十瓩的汽轮机。最近沈阳许多单位互助协作开办联合自备电站，正逐步形成一片片地方的自备电力网。（附图片）
