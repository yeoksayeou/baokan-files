    Southeast Asia Group Creates Tension
    Holds Large-Scale Air Force Exercise
    (Report from our newspaper in Bangkok) The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been holding a large-scale air force exercise at the Don Muang Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, for several days. This eight-day military exercise began on March 2nd.
    It is reported that the air force and paratrooper units of the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand are participating in this exercise. The French air force units sent to participate in this exercise are currently stranded in Tehran due to heavy snow and other reasons.
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique of Taiwan has also sent "observers" to participate in this exercise.
    This aggressive military group's air force exercise, codenamed "Air Progress," is being held in the context of the United States intensifying military intervention in some countries in Southeast Asia and creating tension in the region. The Deputy Commander of this exercise, Thomas Mooreman, Commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force, clamored today that the member states of this military group should "concentrate their resources and strength" to "safeguard freedom."

    东南亚集团制造紧张局势
    举行大规模空军演习
    本报讯　曼谷消息：东南亚条约组织连日以来在泰国曼谷的当穆安机场举行大规模空军演习。这次为期八天的军事演习是从本月2日开始的。
    据报道，美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和泰国的空军和伞兵部队参加了这次演习。法国派来参加这次演习的空军部队由于大雪等原因目前滞留在德黑兰。
    台湾蒋介石集团也派遣了“观察员”参加这次演习。
    这个侵略性军事集团的这次以“空中进步”为代号的空军演习，是在美国加紧对东南亚地区的一些国家进行军事干涉和在这个地区制造紧张局势的情况下举行的。这次演习的副总指挥、美国第十三航空队司令托马斯·穆尔曼今天竭力叫嚣这个军事集团的成员国应该“集中它们的资源和力量”来“维护自由”。
