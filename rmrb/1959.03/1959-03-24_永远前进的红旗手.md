　　The Ever-Advancing Red Flag Bearer
　　By our correspondent Wang Chongjie
　　In these warm spring days, as the Hungarian people are grandly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Soviet Republic, I interviewed two veteran revolutionary fighters in Budapest – Németh Lajos and Sándor Rezső.

　　Red Sun Rises in the East
　　"My revolutionary journey began on the land of Soviet Russia. In the crucible of the Great October Revolution, I was tempered, gained new life, and a forever young heart." Németh Lajos, a revolutionary veteran in his seventies, began recalling the scene from nearly half a century ago with great excitement.

　　During the First World War, Németh Lajos was forcibly conscripted into the army, and later captured by the Russian army in 1916. While in Tsarist Russia, Németh Lajos established a deep friendship with advanced Russian workers in the Ural region, and later connected with an old Bolshevik from a printing factory. He gradually realized the root of the war and the way out of the war's disasters, carried out propaganda and mobilization work among the prisoners of war, and actively organized a revolutionary committee in the prisoner-of-war camp on the eve of the October Revolution.

　　After the outbreak of the October Revolution, Németh Lajos immediately led a large number of Hungarian prisoners of war to participate in the Russian working class's struggle to destroy the Tsar's rule. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, they, along with their Russian brothers, fought countless battles against the White bandit army in the Ural region and northern Russia. Neither hunger, cold, nor the fatigue of day and night fighting shook the people who fought for the truth. Many Hungarians shed their last drop of blood to defend the world's first proletarian state.

　　In April 1918, Németh Lajos participated in the Hungarian Communist group organized in Moscow at that time, headed by Béla Kun.

　　The short poem "To Mother," written by Németh Lajos before returning to his country, fully expressed his feelings at the time.

　　The red sun rises in the East,
　　The great October Revolution gives us
　　Hope, confidence, and strength,
　　Wait, beloved Mother,
　　We will return to your side with torches,
　　Like the Russian worker brothers,
　　Thoroughly bury the inhuman old society!

　　Petrel in the Storm
　　In November 1918, Németh Lajos and more than eighty comrades, headed by Béla Kun, returned to Budapest from Moscow after many hardships. They quickly united the advanced elements of the working class and established the Hungarian Communist Party on November 20 of that year.

　　Lajos and Sándor Rezső were among the first members of the Party. The organized vanguard of the proletariat, armed with Marxism-Leninism, immediately raised the banner of socialist revolution and actively engaged in preparations for the revolution. Lajos and other comrades prepared the "Red Newspaper," working day and night to disseminate the Party's statements to the masses in a timely manner; Comrade Rezső carried out the work of developing the Party among the workers in Budapest.

　　The reactionary government, formed by the coalition of the liberal bourgeoisie and the right-wing of the Social Democratic Party, was fundamentally unable to save the nation from the whirlpool of disaster, but it adopted cruel terror against the Communist Party. In February 1919, the government imprisoned many leaders of the Communist Party and declared the Communist Party an illegal organization.

　　The Party Committee sent Németh Lajos to Moscow quickly to meet with Lenin, report on the situation in Hungary to the revolutionary teacher of the world's proletariat, and seek his advice. After receiving the Party's instructions, Németh Lajos disguised himself as a returning Russian prisoner of war and rushed to Moscow day and night, braving the dangers of crossing the German front line and traversing a no man's land. In the area near the Russian border, the weather was freezing and the cold wind was biting. Since no horse-drawn carriages could be hired, they had to walk. They often fell into snow pits and often got lost at night.

　　After a long journey, Németh Lajos finally arrived in Moscow. Lenin warmly and kindly received the heroic representatives of the Hungarian working class in his office at the Kremlin. He learned in detail about all the changes that had taken place in Hungary and the attitudes of various classes, and thoughtfully helped the Hungarian people consider the path to liberation.

　　The reactionary government's intimidation did not make the Hungarian Communists shrink. After returning to the country, Lajos, according to the Party's decision, returned to his hometown of Eger to work in the countryside. During this period, Sándor Rezső was developing the Party's work in the Budapest People's Militia. The Party's influence in factories, mines, and among poor peasants grew day by day, and its prestige became higher and higher.

　　Due to the onslaught of the revolutionary wave of the masses, the coalition government of the liberal bourgeoisie and the right-wing of the Social Democratic Party faced a crisis in March 1919. Their alliance broke down, and the coalition government was forced to resign, handing over power to the revolutionary working class. On March 21, 1919, the Hungarian proletariat announced the establishment of the Soviet Republic.

　　Struggling to Defend the Soviet
　　When talking about the bold initiatives and heroic struggles of the Soviet Republic's one hundred and thirty-three days, which are forever recorded in the glorious history of the Hungarian nation and the world's workers' movement, Comrades Németh Lajos and Sándor Rezső could not suppress their fervent emotions, and the flame of youth rekindled in their eyes.

　　After the establishment of the Soviet Republic, the Party sent Németh Lajos to Heves County to lead the work. In these days of earth-shattering changes, he led the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the confiscation of capitalists' enterprises and landlords' land in this state.

　　But soon, the Entente imperialists and the overthrown exploiting classes in Hungary colluded to organize an attack on the Soviet Republic, intending to allow capitalists and landlords to ride on the heads of the Hungarian people once again.

　　The broad masses of working people immediately responded to the Party's resounding call to defend the socialist motherland. Comrade Sándor Rezső took up arms immediately when the war of defense began. Initially, he served as the political commissar of the Third Division of the Hungarian Red Army, and later as the director of the political department of the Third Army Corps.

　　The Hungarian Red Army, born in the struggle against the Entente imperialist aggressors, displayed sublime heroism in battle, bravely stopping and repelling the enemy that was superior in strength, and cutting off the lines of Romania and Czechoslovakia.

　　When the Hungarian Red Army pursued the armies of the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie into the city of Kassa in Slovakia, it was warmly welcomed by the local residents. Sándor Rezső said that before the dust of the reactionary armies had settled, people had put red flags on their houses, and the streets were lined with cheering crowds. Men, women, old and young hugged and kissed the Hungarian Red Army soldiers, and many were moved to tears. The citizens offered the most beautiful flowers and the best food to the Red Army. A young girl even insisted on carrying the machine gun for the advancing Hungarian Red Army machine gunner for a long distance.

　　Due to the siege by the Entente imperialists' absolute superior forces, the treacherous acts of the domestic landlords and bourgeoisie, and the betrayal of the revisionist elements in the merged Party and Soviet government institutions, the Soviet Republic temporarily failed. But the one hundred and thirty-three days of creation and struggle of the Soviet Republic absolutely won a moral victory. The Soviet Republic lives forever in the hearts of the people. Hungarian revolutionary fighters did not yield; they continued to wage a more arduous struggle to achieve final victory.

　　The Ever-Advancing Red Flag Bearer
　　The failure of the revolution severely damaged the Party, and tens of thousands of outstanding soldiers of the working class and poor peasants were massacred or imprisoned. But even in this extremely difficult period, the Hungarian proletariat maintained its composure, fortitude, and perseverance.

　　Németh Lajos continued to persist in underground work in the country despite the cruel white terror. Together with other comrades, he first began the work of restoring the Party organization and providing relief to the families of the victims. Comrades in exile abroad also strongly supported their struggle.

　　In the face of a dense network of spies and gendarmes, Németh Lajos was forced to change his place of residence frequently. During the twenty-five years of underground struggle, he traveled almost all over Hungary. He worked as a carpenter, miner, cook, shop assistant, hired hand...

　　When the Soviet Republic failed, Comrade Sándor Rezső was arrested and imprisoned. The enemy decided to imprison him for a long time. In prison, he suffered all kinds of torture. The enemy also tried to buy him off. But this faithful son of the working class never stopped fighting, even in the face of the enemy's knives. He spent two and a half years in prison. Later, due to an exchange of prisoners, Sándor Rezső was rescued and went to Moscow.

　　During his time in the Soviet Union, he engaged in theoretical research, summed up the experiences of the revolution, and helped and cooperated with the struggle at home. After 1927, Sándor Rezső went to Paris and other places to carry out political work among Hungarian exiles. Later, he returned to work in the Soviet Union for a period of time.

　　When the Spanish people launched a war against the fascist rebellion and imperialist intervention in 1936, this proletarian internationalist fighter immediately went to Spain, where he served as the leader of an artillery battalion, participating in more than twenty major battles in Madrid and other places. Together with internationalist fighters from all over the world, he supported the struggle of the Spanish people.

　　When the Soviet-German War broke out, Sándor Rezső and others organized the Kossuth Radio in the Soviet Union. This radio station conducted extensive anti-fascist propaganda to the Hungarian people. They also conducted education and organizational work among the prisoners of war, organizing guerrilla groups to cross the front lines and carry out heroic struggles behind Hitler and Horthy.

　　Old and Strong Welcoming the East Wind
　　April 4, 1945, marked a new turning point in the history of the Hungarian nation. The Soviet Red Army finally crushed the rule of Horthy and Hitler's fascists, liberating the Hungarian people. After twenty-five years of underground struggle, the Communist Party once again stood freely before the Hungarian people, undertaking the great cause of rebuilding the motherland and restoring national rebirth.

　　Németh Lajos and Sándor Rezső immediately participated in this restoration and construction work after liberation. The joy of victory restored the vitality of the veteran fighters. They worked tirelessly day and night to build a better new life.

　　Due to years of hard work, Németh Lajos lost his sight in both eyes in 1953. After treatment, only one eye regained its vision. But the old man Lajos was not willing to retire, and he continued to contribute his strength to socialist construction.

　　The veteran fighters greatly cherish the fraternal friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet people forged in their joint struggle last year. After returning to his country, Sándor Rezső has been committed to strengthening the friendship between the people of Hungary and the Soviet Union. He served for a long time as the secretary-general of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association and edited a publication introducing the great Soviet Union.

　　Under the leadership of the working-class party, the Hungarian people quickly healed the wounds of war, and rapidly developed the national economy, science, and culture, advancing on the road of socialism. However, counter-revolutionary groups, ranging from revisionist elements to fascist elements, launched an insidious counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956 with the support and instigation of Western imperialism. They attempted to subvert the socialist system once again. Lajos and Rezső pointed out that October 1956 was very similar to the counter-revolution of August 1919. The thugs, who initially concealed themselves under the cloak of "democracy," quickly exposed the original form of fascist counter-revolution and began a white terror.

　　The veteran revolutionary fighters, who had been tested in battle for a long time and had rich revolutionary experience, once again took up arms to defend the freedom and independence of the socialist motherland. With the help of the Soviet Red Army, the Hungarian people thoroughly crushed the counter-revolutionary group and the despicable conspiracies of imperialism.

　　Although Comrade Németh Lajos was old and frail, and retired after repeated persuasion from comrades, he still insisted on doing the Party's work. He is now the secretary of the Party organization in the first residential district of the 18th district of Budapest. He is busy every day carrying out various propaganda and organizational work, using the glorious revolutionary tradition to educate the younger generation.

　　Sándor Rezső still goes to work at the Hungarian Guerrilla League every day. He is a member of the Presidium of the Guerrilla League and a member of the National Committee of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association.

　　At the end of the conversation with the reporter, Comrade Sándor Rezső said: "The world has undergone tremendous changes in the past forty years. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind today. Our socialist countries are developing rapidly, while the capitalist world is declining day by day. We old soldiers are now preparing to enter the paradise of communist society with joyful hearts."

    永远前进的红旗手
    本报记者　王崇杰
    在这春暖花开的日子里，当匈牙利人民正在隆重庆祝苏维埃共和国四十周年的时候，记者访问了布达佩斯的两位老革命战士——内梅特·拉约什和山多·雷热。
    东方升起红太阳
    “我的革命道路是在苏维埃俄罗斯大地上开始的。在伟大十月革命战斗的熔炉中，我得到了锻炼，获得了新生和一颗永远年青的心。”七十多岁的老革命战士内梅特·拉约什非常激动地开始回忆差不多半个世纪前的情景。
    第一次世界大战时，内梅特·拉约什被强征入伍，后来在1916年被俄国军队俘虏。在沙皇俄国时，内梅特·拉约什在乌拉尔一带同俄国先进的工人建立了深厚的友谊，后来又同一个印刷厂的老布尔什维克取得了联系。他逐渐认清了战争的根源和解脱战争灾难的出路，在战俘中开展了宣传鼓动工作，十月革命的前夜，并在俘虏营中积极组织了革命委员会。
    十月革命爆发后，内梅特·拉约什便立即率领着大批匈牙利战俘，参加了俄国工人阶级摧毁沙皇统治的斗争。在布尔什维克党的领导下，他们和俄罗斯兄弟一起，先后在乌拉尔一带和俄国北部与白匪军进行了无数次的战斗。饥寒交迫和日夜战斗的疲乏，都没有使为真理而斗争的人们动摇，很多匈牙利人都为保卫世界上第一个无产阶级的国家流尽了最后一滴血。
    1918年4月，内梅特·拉约什参加了当时在莫斯科以孔·贝拉为首的组织起来的匈牙利共产党小组。
    内梅特·拉约什在回国前写的题为“给母亲”的短诗，充分表达了他当时的心情。
    东方升起了红色的太阳，
    伟大的十月革命给我们
    带来了希望、信心和力量，
    等着吧，敬爱的母亲，
    我们将带着火炬回到你的身旁，
    像俄罗斯的工人兄弟一样，
    把惨无人道的旧社会彻底埋葬！
    暴风雨中的海燕
    1918年11月，内梅特·拉约什同以孔·贝拉为首的八十多个同志，经过很多艰险，从莫斯科赶回了布达佩斯。他们很快地团结了工人阶级的先进分子，于当年11月20日成立了匈牙利共产党。
    拉约什和山多·雷热都是党的第一批党员，以马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的无产阶级有组织的先锋队，立即高举起了社会主义革命的旗帜，积极投入了革命的准备工作。拉约什和其他同志一起筹办了“红色报”，日夜不停地忙于把党的声明及时传播到广大群众中去；雷热同志在布达佩斯工人中进行了发展党的工作。
    当时的自由资产阶级和社会民主党右翼联合组成的反动政府根本无法把民族从灾难的旋涡中拯救出来，但是它对共产党又采取了残酷的恐怖手段，1919年2月，政府把很多共产党的领袖关入监狱，并宣布共产党为非法组织。
    党委派内梅特·拉约什迅速赶到莫斯科去会见列宁，向世界无产阶级的革命导师汇报当时匈牙利情况并向他请教。内梅特·拉约什接到党的指示后，便化装成一个回国的俄国俘虏日夜不停地向莫斯科赶去，在冒着危险穿过德军阵线之后，还要越过一段真空地带。在接近俄罗斯边境的地区时，冰天雪地，寒风刺骨，当时又雇不到马车，只得徒步前进，经常跌倒在雪坑中，夜晚还常常迷路。
    经过长途跋涉之后，内梅特·拉约什终于赶到了莫斯科，列宁在克里姆林宫办公室里非常热情和亲切地接见了各位英勇的匈牙利工人级阶的代表，他详细地了解了匈牙利发生的一切变化和各个阶层的态度，并且深思熟虑地帮助匈牙利人民考虑了解放斗争的途径。
    反动政府的恐吓并没有使匈牙利共产党人畏缩，拉约什回国后又按党的决定回到他的故乡爱格尔一带的农村中去进行工作。山多·雷热这时期是在布达佩斯人民纠察队中开展党的工作，党在工厂、矿山和贫苦农民中的影响一天比一天地扩大起来，威信一天比一天更高。
    由于群众革命浪潮的袭击，在1919年3月自由资产阶级和社会民主党右翼的联合政府发生了危机，他们的同盟也因而破裂，联合政府被迫辞职，把政权交给革命的工人阶级。1919年3月21日，匈牙利无产阶级宣布成立了苏维埃共和国。
    为保卫苏维埃而斗争
    在谈到永远载入匈牙利民族和世界工人运动光荣史册的苏维埃共和国一百三十三天的大胆创举和英勇斗争时，内梅特·拉约什和山多·雷热同志无法压制热烈的情感，青春的火焰又重新燃烧在他们的眼里。
    苏维埃共和国成立后，党把内梅特·拉约什派到赫威斯州作领导工作。在这些翻天复地的日子里，他在这个州领导了镇压反革命、没收资本家的企业和地主土地的工作。
    但是不久，协约国帝国主义和匈牙利国内被推翻的剥削阶级，便勾结起来组织了对苏维埃共和国的进攻，他们要让资本家和地主再度骑在匈牙利人民头上。
    广大的劳动人民立刻响应了党发出的保卫社会主义祖国的响亮号召。山多·雷热同志在卫国战争开始时，便立刻拿起了武器。起初他担任了匈牙利红军第三师的政治委员，后来又担任第三兵团政治部主任。
    在反对协约国帝国主义侵略者的斗争中诞生的匈牙利红军，在战斗中表现了崇高的英雄主义，英勇地阻止并击退了在力量上占优势的敌人，切断了罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克的战线。
    当匈牙利红军追击捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级的军队进入斯洛伐克的卡涓城时，受到当地居民热烈欢迎。山多·雷热讲道，反动的军队刚刚逃跑的尘土还没消，人民便在房屋上插起了红旗，街道两旁站满了欢呼的群众，男女老少和匈牙利红军战士互相拥抱接吻，很多人都感动地流下了泪。市民们把最美的鲜花和最好的食品都献给了红军。一位年青的姑娘并且硬要求替挺进的匈牙利红军机枪手背了很长一段路的机枪。
    由于协约国帝国主义绝对优势兵力的围攻，国内地主资产阶级的卖国勾当以及合并后的党内和苏维埃政权机构中的修正主义分子的叛卖行为，苏维埃共和国暂告失败了。但是苏维埃共和国一百三十三天的创造和斗争，却绝对赢得了道义上的胜利。苏维埃共和国永远活在人民的心中。匈牙利革命战士并没有屈服，他们继续为取得最后的胜利展开更艰苦的斗争。
    永远前进的红旗手
    革命的失败使党遭到严重的摧残，成千上万工人阶级和贫农的优秀战士被屠杀或置入狱中。但是就是在这异常危难的时期，匈牙利的无产阶级也保持了镇定、刚毅和坚韧不拔的精神。
    内梅特·拉约什不顾残酷的白色恐怖，继续在国内坚持了地下工作。他同别的同志一起首先开始了恢复党组织和救济被害者家属的工作。流亡在国外的同志也大力支持了他们的斗争。
    在特务和宪兵密布的情况下，内梅特·拉约什被迫经常改换居住地点。在二十五年的地下斗争时期，他几乎走遍了匈牙利所有的地区。他做过木匠、矿工、厨师、店员、雇工……。
    苏维埃共和国失败时，山多·雷热同志被捕入狱。敌人决定长期监禁他。在狱中，他受尽了各种折磨。敌人也曾企图收买他。但这位工人阶级忠实的儿子，就是在敌人的屠刀前面也从没有停止过斗争。在监狱里他度过了两年半。后来由于交换俘虏，山多·雷热便被解救前往莫斯科。
    在苏联期间，他从事了理论研究工作，总结了革命的经验，并帮助和配合了国内的斗争。1927年后，山多·雷热前往巴黎等地，在匈牙利流亡者中开展了政治工作。后来他又回到苏联工作了一个时期。
    当1936年西班牙人民掀起了反对法西斯叛乱和帝国主义干涉的卫国战争时，这位无产阶级国际主义战士便立即赶到西班牙，在那里他担任了炮兵营的领导工作，先后在马德里等地参加了二十多次主要战役。与来自世界各国的国际主义战士一起支援了西班牙人民的斗争。
    苏德战争爆发，山多·雷热等在苏联组织了柯树特电台。这个电台向匈牙利人民进行了广泛的反法西斯宣传。他们并且在战俘中进行了教育和组织工作，组织游击小组穿过前线在希特勒和霍尔蒂的背后开展了英雄斗争。
    老当益壮喜东风
    1945年4月4日在匈牙利民族的历史上出现了新的转折点。苏联红军最后粉碎了霍尔蒂和希特勒法西斯的统治，解放了匈牙利人民。经过二十五年的地下斗争之后，共产党又重新自由地站在匈牙利人民面前，承担了重建祖国和恢复民族新生的伟大事业。
    内梅特·拉约什和山多·雷热在解放后立即便参加了这种恢复和修建工作。胜利的喜悦重新恢复了老战士们的活力。他们不辞劳苦地夜以继日地为建设美好的新生活而忙碌着。
    由于长年的劳累，1953年内梅特·拉约什双目失明。经过医治后只有一只眼睛恢复了视力。但是拉约什老人并不甘心休养，他继续为社会主义建设而贡献着自己的力量。
    老战士们非常珍贵匈苏人民去年共同斗争结成的兄弟友谊。山多·雷热归国后一直致力于加强匈苏两国人民的友谊，他曾长期地担任匈苏友好协会的秘书长并主编介绍伟大苏联的刊物。
    在工人阶级政党的领导下，匈牙利人民很快地医治了战争的创伤，并且迅速地发展了国民经济和科学文化，在社会主义的道路上前进。可是从修正主义分子起到法西斯分子为止的反革命集团，都在西方帝国主义的支持和策动下，在1956年10月发动了阴险的反革命暴乱。他们企图再一次颠复社会主义制度。拉约什和雷热指出，1956年10月同1919年8月的反革命很相似，开始隐蔽在“民主”外衣下的暴徒们，很快就暴露了法西斯反革命的原形，开始了白色恐怖。
    久经战斗考验的和具有丰富革命经验的老革命战士们，又重新拿起了武器，捍卫了社会主义祖国的自由和独立。在苏联红军的帮助下，匈牙利人民彻底粉碎了反革命集团和帝国主义的卑鄙阴谋。
    内梅特·拉约什同志虽然因年高体衰，经过同志再三劝说退休了，但是他仍然坚持做党的工作。现在是布达佩斯第十八区第一居民区党组织的书记。天天忙于进行各种宣传和组织工作，以光荣的革命传统来教育年轻的一代。
    现在山多·雷热每天还按时到匈牙利游击队联盟上班工作，他是游击队联盟主席团的委员，并且担任匈苏友协全国委员会的委员。
    在结束同记者的谈话时，山多·雷热同志说：“四十年来世界发生了巨大的变化。正像毛泽东同志指出的，今天东风已经压倒西风。我们社会主义国家正在飞跃地发展，资本主义世界却在日益衰退。我们这批老兵现在都怀着喜悦的心情，准备走进共产主义社会的乐园。”
