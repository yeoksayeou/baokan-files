Their Lives Shine in the Arctic Night
By Our Correspondent Li Nan

Speaking of the Arctic region, people naturally think of ice, snow, storms, and severe cold. However, many may not realize that there is a trend here that is becoming warmer year by year. Scientists have found that the source of the warmth is due to the increased amount of Atlantic water flowing into the Arctic Ocean. But the people living within the Arctic Circle have another explanation. They say that more and more scientific stations and towns are being built, and more and more people are coming, so the Arctic is gradually becoming warmer.

People bring light and heat, warmth and brightness, and this simple truth is even more prominent and vivid in the Arctic region. It is none other than the heroic Soviet people who are changing the face of the Arctic region. They have built scientific villages and towns in the heart of the Arctic, and they have scattered bright pearls in the long night and desolate islands. Day and night they are sending meteorological materials to people in other parts of the world, and they are tirelessly exploring the treasures of the Arctic region.

How should we describe these ordinary yet great Soviet people? At the Seventh Drifting Ice Station, they are few in number, only twenty-eight in total. The half-year Arctic night is long and unbearable, the storms are fierce, the ice may break at any time, and ferocious polar bears may pounce unexpectedly. But not only are they not afraid or tired, but they become radiant and energetic whenever they mention life and work in the Arctic. Shepirov, a meteorologist at the drifting ice station, has been working in the Arctic for more than twenty years, but he is still attracted by these meteorological instruments and the vast amount of scientific work, and comes to the Arctic region year after year. He said, "If I were twenty years old now, and had to choose a career again, I would definitely choose to be a polar worker." Shepirov spent his first winter on Novaya Zemlya more than twenty years ago. For several years, the conditions on the island were very difficult. Once, when he was working outside, he encountered a storm, and the wind was so strong that he could not stand up. He had to lie on the ground. Although he could see the lights in the cabin flickering not far ahead, he could not move forward. Later, when the wind weakened, his comrades found him half-frozen to death. Another time, he set off to get bread for the station personnel. When he set off, the sky was full of stars and the moon was bright, but halfway he encountered a storm again. He had to use his hunting rifle to help him move forward. He still doesn't understand how he got out this time, but after all, this strong and energetic man once again overcame the violence of Arctic nature. Over the past twenty years, how many storms, cold, and long Arctic nights has he experienced, and how much scientific data has he sent for people to use!

Over the past twenty years, Shepirov has seen the scientific network in the Arctic region become larger and larger, the power of nature retreating steadily, mankind advancing step by step, and technical and living conditions greatly improved. Cross-country vehicles have replaced sledges, fresh meat has replaced salted meat, the First Drifting Ice Station had only ten tons of supplies, while now a single late spring transport is two hundred tons of supplies; the original tents were as cold as minus twenty degrees Celsius, while now the tents are twenty degrees Celsius above zero, as warm as spring; in the past, small planes could only carry two people, and luggage had to be hung under the fuselage, now modern large planes fly back and forth between the various scientific stations in the Arctic. He said: "I have seen very amazing progress in the Arctic region in the past twenty years, and the content of the work has become more and more abundant, so every time I leave, I feel like a traveler hoping to return home, and I return to the scientific station in the Arctic."

What moves us most is the selfless labor spirit of the Arctic staff, which is an embodiment of the noble qualities unique to the Russian people of being faithful to the tasks of the motherland and dedicated to their careers. During our visit to the station, we watched them face the wind and snow every day, put on their leather coats, and then quickly disappear into a blur; we watched them return to the tent, their bodies turning white, their faces covered with ice and snow, and ice strips hanging from their beards; we watched them take a torch every hour to record the readings on the meteorological instruments; we watched them being blown off their feet by the strong wind when releasing sounding balloons, seemingly about to fly away with the balloons. They are creating merits in these daily arduous labors.

Station Director Belov is an unforgettable person. He combines the excellent characteristics of a scholar, a leader, and an ordinary worker. We sat with him in a small prefabricated wooden house, which was his studio and bedroom, his desk was piled with scientific materials and books, microscopes, and charts. He showed us a map of the Arctic region's terrain that he had spent ten years creating. Looking at this colorful map, we seemed to penetrate the ice layer of the Arctic and thousands of meters of seawater, and saw the intricate topography of the ocean floor. Mountains, deep valleys, and plains were all clearly visible. Belov told us that this map had surprised scientific staff from Britain and the the United States. They were not only surprised that the Soviet people had a thorough understanding of the Arctic Ocean floor, but also that the Russian people had such a spirit of perseverance, meticulousness, and dedication to research. After showing us the map, Belov sat back at his desk, and looked down at the microscope, carefully observing the mud and gravel taken from the ocean floor thousands of meters deep. More than ten hours passed, and we still saw the light on his small window flickering in the snow swirling in the wind.

On the fourth day of our life at the station, the originally frozen cracks became active again, and a sharp alarm sounded on the ice sheet. At such a sudden and tense moment, we saw these calm scientific workers suddenly turn into agile soldiers like on the battlefield, and Station Director Belov became a calm and composed commander in times of crisis. At this time, the world was dark, and it was impossible to distinguish between the roar of the wind and the sound of ice cracking, but the experienced station personnel were able to immediately determine the direction of the danger, and the twenty-eight people gathered together in one area to engage in a battle to conquer the forefront of the Arctic. By the time the danger had definitely passed, their whole bodies seemed to be made of ice and snow. Everyone gathered in the club, drank a cup of hot tea, and then immediately dispersed to their respective observation posts.

Living, working, and fighting must be integrated into one, which is the tradition of every polar scientific station. This spirit has been accumulated and nurtured over many years. The scientific staff told us in conversation that this tradition, in the long run, can be traced back to the era of the great Russian Arctic explorer Sedov, and in the near term, it should be mentioned the Chelyuskin incident in 1934. In February of that year, the Chelyuskin expedition ship was destroyed by an iceberg, and the personnel were evacuated to the ice floes, drifting awaiting rescue. However, the Chelyuskin personnel did not passively wait. While fighting against the difficult and harsh conditions, they turned the ice floe into a base for scientific research. They drifted for more than two months and carried out a huge research project. When they ended their drifting and returned to the mainland, they not only rejoiced to survive, but also collected a large amount of scientific material.

The Chelyuskin incident laid the cornerstone for the floating ice scientific research station that followed. The Soviet method and style of the Chelyuskin personnel, which combined work, life, and combat, has been inherited and carried forward by the staff working in the Arctic region today.

Living, working, and fighting turn the twenty-eight people at the drifting ice station into a strong collective. The heroism of fighting against difficulties and natural violence, the collective love and solidarity, make this small collective seem to have infinite power, making everyone noble and brave. Once, the doctor of the drifting ice station, an enthusiastic and lively young man, told us when talking about the collectivist spirit of the drifting ice station: all the work and life on the drifting ice station are organized according to the spirit of communism.

The people at the drifting ice station have the same goals and the same ideas. They do not distinguish between each other in life, and they do not distinguish between large and small in work. In addition to professional division of labor, they also jointly bear all labor tasks. The first day we saw this Doctor Makarenko, he was carrying supplies, the next day we saw him become a cook, and the third day we met him in the engine room, where he became an assistant delivering materials to the mechanic. But he is also a doctor. As long as someone in any tent is uncomfortable, he will go there immediately. When we were in the field, we found that the doctor was paying attention to everyone's face, because he was afraid that someone would not pay attention and let the Arctic cold wind damage their skin. What a meticulous person who cares for his comrades!

In the big family of polar workers, Makarenko is still a new member. He only came to work last year. But his skill and enthusiasm have already won him credibility among his comrades. He told us that it seems that he has been attracted by the magnetic force of the Arctic region and will not be separated from it in the future.

Among the staff at the station, geologist Samsunolov is a particularly enthusiastic and hospitable person. He takes some time almost every day to come to our tent to talk. He is only in his thirties, but he has been working in the Arctic region for more than ten years. As a young geologist, he came to the remote areas of the Arctic with the youthful dream of loving new things. Year after year, he has come to understand a truth more and more: the more people who stand and fight in the most difficult places, the more easily they can show the value of life. He said: "I came to the north with a curious mentality, but in the north I understood the value of life. When living in the loving collective of the Arctic work station, when the last point is marked on the map, at this time, drinking a cup of strong tea brought from the heart of the motherland, listening to a song broadcast from Moscow specifically for the Arctic work station, then you will think of the next step of work, you will have new strength, you will feel that you have received the support and happiness you need as a person. Only those who dedicate their lives and youth to the motherland can understand the significance of this support and happiness."

Compared with life and work in the frontier areas of various places, the difficulties in the Arctic are much greater. But for the Soviet Arctic staff, all difficulties seem to be nothing. We saw that because the climate was bad, it was very difficult for the plane to take off and land each time. When we occasionally talked to the pilot Moskalinko about whether the Arctic climate could be made more ideal, this quiet Belarusian replied: "Let the Arctic be so violent and harsh forever, what's so terrible about that! Our progress cannot be stopped."

No matter how fierce the cold wind on the Arctic Ocean is, it cannot shake the strong will of the Soviet Arctic staff. Pilot Arkhipov landed a four-engine Tu-4 heavy aircraft on an ice floe. This type of aircraft requires a 1,500-meter-long runway, but before the aircraft had time to fly away, a sudden gust of wind shook the ice floe, and the ice floe under the aircraft broke, and the 1,500-meter ice floe became 900 meters. But Arkhipov did not hesitate at all. He crawled into the cabin and rushed the aircraft onto the 900-meter runway. In the last section, the aircraft left the ice floe.

This is a heroic deed of an Arctic pilot that we heard at the floating ice station. The countless merits created by the creators of such deeds have converged into the glorious cause of the Soviet people conquering the Arctic. In this cause of the people, the names of many Arctic workers have become symbols of heroism and courage in the new era.

Thousands of miles of misty snowfields, more than half a year of long nights. In this northern border of the earth, the Soviet Arctic personnel, like strong trees, stand tall and unyielding; like soldiers on an expedition, they bravely move forward. Their lives shine in the Arctic night, bringing warmth and light to the vast land and ocean of the Arctic. (Attached picture)

    他们的生命在北极夜中放出光彩
    本报记者　李楠
    提到北极地区，人们最先联想到的自然是冰雪、风暴和严寒，但是许多人也许没有想到这里有一年比一年变得比较温暖一些的趋势。科学家们研究出温暖的来源是因为大西洋的水流注入北冰洋的水量增多。但是居住在北极圈内的人们却另有一种说法。他们说，开辟的科学站和城镇越来越多，来的人越来越多，因此，北极也就逐渐温暖起来了。
    人们带来光和热，温暖和光明，这一普通的道理在北极地区更显得非常的突出和鲜明。不是别人，正是英勇豪迈的苏维埃人在改变着北极地区的面貌。他们在北极中心建成了科学的村镇，他们在漫长的黑夜和荒凉的岛屿撒下了明亮的珍珠。他们日日夜夜在为地球其他部分的人们发出气象材料，他们不知疲倦地在发掘着北极地区的宝藏。
    该怎样来描述这些平凡而又伟大的普通苏维埃人啊！在第七浮冰站，他们的人数不多，一共才二十八个。半年的北极夜是漫长的，难以忍受的，风暴是凛冽的，冰块随时可能破裂，凶恶的白熊会出其不意地迎面扑来。但是他们不但没有畏惧，没有疲倦，反而每逢提到北极的生活和工作情景时便神采奕奕，精神百倍。浮冰站上的气象工作者歇皮洛夫已经在北极地区工作二十多年了，但是他照旧被这些气象仪表，被浩繁的科学工作所吸引，年复一年地来北极地区。他说：“如果我现在才二十岁，再一次选择职业的话，我一定还是选择作一个极地工作者”。歇皮洛夫二十多年前第一次在新地岛上过冬，一连几年，岛上的条件都是非常艰苦的。有一次他在外边工作时遇到风暴，风势大得使人站立不住，只好伏在地下，虽然看得见小屋中的灯光在前面不远处闪烁，但是却不能前进一步。后来风势减弱，同志们发现他已经冻得半死了。又一次他出发去为站上人员取面包，临行时满天星斗，月色皎洁，但是走上半路却又遇到了风暴，他只好用随身带的猎枪来帮助前进。他至今还不明白这次又是怎样走出来的，但毕竟这个体格坚强精力旺盛的人又一次战胜了北极自然的暴力。二十多年来，他经历了多少风暴寒冷和漫长的北极夜，他又发出了多少科学资料供人们利用啊！
    二十多年来，歇皮洛夫看到北极地区的科学网越来越大，自然的淫威在节节退却，人类在步步前进，技术和生活条件大大改善了。越野车代替了雪橇，鲜肉代替了咸肉，第一号浮冰站一共只有十吨物资，而现在一次春末运输就是两百吨物资；原先的帐篷里面也冷到零下二十度，现在的帐篷内是零上二十度，温暖如春；从前小飞机只能载两人，行李要吊在机身下面，现在现代化的大飞机在北极各科学站间来来去去。他说：“我二十年来看到北极地区的进步非常惊人，工作的内容越来越丰富，因此每次离开以后，又像游子希望回家一样，又回到北极的科学站上来了。”
    最使我们感动的是北极工作人员的忘我劳动精神，这是一种俄罗斯人民所特有的忠实于祖国任务、对事业抱献身态度的高尚品质的体现。我们在站上访问的日子，天天看着他们迎着风雪，把皮衣往身上一披，然后就迅速消逝在一片迷蒙中；看着他们回到帐篷里来，一身变白，满面冰雪，胡须上也挂着冰条；看着他们每隔一个小时拿着火炬去纪载气象仪表上的纪录；看着他们放送探空气球时被狂风卷得站立不住，似乎将要随着气球飞去。他们在这些日常的艰苦的劳动中创立着功绩。
    站长别洛夫是一个令人难以忘怀的人物，他的身上兼有学者、领导人员和普通劳动者的优秀特色。我们伴着他坐在一间装配式的狭小的木屋里，这是他的工作室和寝室，书桌上堆满了科学资料和书籍、显微镜和图表。他给我们看了一张他用了十年的劳动绘成的北极地区地面形势图。注视着这件色彩纷纭的图面，我们仿佛透穿了北极的冰层和数千公尺的海水，看见了那海洋底下的错综复杂的地形。山脉、深谷、平地，历历在目。别洛夫告诉我们，这张地图曾经使英美的科学工作人员感到惊异，他们不但惊异苏联人民已经把北极洋底了如指掌，而且更加惊异的是俄罗斯人这种坚忍细致、埋头钻研的精神。给我们看完了地图之后，别洛夫又坐到书桌旁边，俯首在显微镜上面，仔细观察从数千公尺深的洋底取上来的泥土和沙砾。十几小时过去了，我们还看见他小窗上的灯光在狂风卷起的雪团中闪烁。
    在我们生活在站上的第四天，原来冻合了的裂缝又活跃起来了，冰原上响起了尖锐的警报声音。在这样突发的紧张时刻，我们看到了这些冷静的科学工作者们突然变成了像战场上的敏捷的战士，站长别洛夫变成了临危不乱、镇定有方的指挥人员。这时天地是昏暗的，分不清狂风吼声和冰层破裂的声音，但是富有经验的站上人员能够立刻判断出危险的方向，二十八个人一起集中在一个地区，从事一场征服北极最前线的战斗。等到危险已经肯定过去了的时候，他们的全身已经变成似乎是冰雪铸成的了。大家聚集在俱乐部里，喝上一杯热茶，又立刻分散到各个观察岗位上去。
    生活、工作和战斗都要结成一体，这是每一个极地科学站的传统。这种精神是多少年代积累和培养起来的。科学工作人员在谈话中告诉我们，这种传统从远处来说，可以追溯到伟大的俄罗斯北极探险者塞多夫时代，近一些来说，应该提到1934年的车留斯肯号轮船事件。这年2月份车留斯肯号考察船被冰山撞毁，人员撤到冰块上面，飘流待救。但是车留斯肯号人员没有消极等待，他们一面和困难恶劣条件作斗争，一面把避难的冰块变成科学研究的基地。他们飘流了两个多月，进行了庞大的研究工作。等到结束飘流，回到大陆的时候，他们不仅庆幸生还，而且把大量的科学材料搜集起来了。
    车留斯肯号事件奠定了以后浮冰科学研究站的基石。车留斯肯号人员这一把工作、生活和战斗结合在一起的苏维埃式的方法和作风在今天北极地区的工作人员中得到了继承和发扬。
    生活、工作和战斗把浮冰站上的二十八个人变成一个坚强的集体。向困难和自然暴力作斗争的英雄主义、集体的友爱和团结使这一人数很少的集体仿佛拥有无限的力量，使每个人都变得高尚和勇敢。有一次浮冰站的医生，一个热情活泼的青年人和我们谈到浮冰站上的集体主义精神时说：浮冰站上的一切工作和生活是按照共产主义的精神组织的。
    浮冰站的人们目标一致，思想一致，在生活上不分彼此，在工作上不分巨细。这里的工作除按专业分工外，又共同负担一切劳动任务。我们第一天看到这位马卡连科医生时，他是在搬运物资，第二天又看到他变成了厨师，第三天又在电机房遇到他，他变成了给机械师递送材料的助手。但是他又是医生，只要有哪个帐篷里有人不舒适，他立刻就到哪里去了。在野外的时候，我们发现医生在注意每个人的面孔，原来他是怕谁未曾留心，让北极寒风把皮肤冻坏。多么细致的关心同志的人啊！
    在极地工作者的大家庭中，马卡连柯还是一个新的成员，他去年才来工作。但是他的熟练和热诚已经使他在同志们中间获得了信誉。他告诉我们说，看起来，他已经被北极地区的磁力吸引住，将来的生活不会和它分离了。
    在站上的工作人员中，地质工作者桑姆松洛夫是一个特别热忱好客的人物。他几乎每天都要抽一点闲暇来我们的帐篷中谈话。他才三十来岁，但已经在北极地区工作了十多年的时间。作为青年地质工作者，他抱着青年人的热爱新鲜事物的幻想来到了北极边远的地区。年复一年，他愈加懂得了一项真理：越是站在最艰难地方战斗的人，越是容易显示出生命的价值。他说：“我抱着好奇的心理来到北方，但是在北方我却了解了生命的价值。当生活在北极工作站的友爱的集体中间，当在地图上点完了最后一点，正在这时，喝到一杯远从祖国心脏运来的浓茶，听到一曲莫斯科专门为北极工作站播送的歌曲，这时你又会想起下一步的工作，你会涌现新的力量，你会感到你得到了作为一个人所需要的支持和幸福。把生命和青春献给祖国的人才能理解到这种支持和幸福的意义。”
    比起各地的边疆地区的生活和工作来，北极的困难是要大得多的。但是对于苏联的北极地区工作人员来说，一切困难却都仿佛没有什么，我们看到，因为气候恶劣，飞机每次起飞和降落都很不容易，偶然和飞行员莫斯卡林科谈起能否让北极的气候变得理想一些时，这位沉静的白俄罗斯人回答说：“就让北极永世永代这样狂暴和严酷吧，这又有什么可怕的呢！我们的前进是挡不住的。”
    任随北极海洋上的寒风多么猛烈都不能动摇苏联北极工作人员的顽强意志。飞行员阿希波夫驾着四发动机的图四式重型飞机降落在一浮冰块上，这种飞机需要一千五百公尺长的跑道，但是飞机还没有来得及飞走，突然一阵烈风震动冰块，飞机下的冰块破裂了，一千五百公尺的冰块变成了九百公尺。但是阿希波夫一点没有犹豫，他钻进机舱里去，把飞机冲向九百公尺的跑道。在最后一段地区，飞机离开了冰块。
    这是我们在浮冰站上所听到的一件北极飞行员的英勇事迹。这样的事迹的创造者们立下的无数功绩汇合成苏联人民征服北极的光荣事业。在这个人民的事业中，不少北极工作者的名字已经成了新时代英雄主义、坚强勇敢的象征。
    迷蒙雪野数千里，漫漫长夜大半年。在这地球的北国边疆，苏联北极人员，就像坚固的大树一样，挺立不拔；就像出征的战士一样，奋勇前进。他们的生命在北极夜中放出光彩。给北极广大的土地和海洋带来温暖和光明。（附图片）
