Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Sukegawa Eiichi, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Chairman of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, told Hong Kong newspaper reporters on the 4th: "As a Japanese citizen, it pains me to see that the Japanese government is still adopting a hostile policy towards China in the face of the great achievements China has made in such a short period. I believe that both China and Japan are Asian countries and should cooperate with each other to seek peace in Asia."

He said, "The fundamental key to restoring Sino-Japanese trade relations is for the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its hostile policy towards China."

Sukegawa Eiichi arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th from Guangzhou after visiting China on February 7th. He told reporters: "During my stay in China, I visited various places. I saw that China's construction achievements are very great, and there have been great changes compared to when I visited China last April." He went on to point out: "This shows that China can do a good job of construction without trading with Japan, not only in industry but also in agriculture. The actual situation is that the Chinese government and people are carrying out construction with full confidence."

Sukegawa Eiichi refuted the claim that China's attitude towards the Kishi Nobusuke government was "interference in Japan's internal affairs." He pointed out that China's attitude is only directed at the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile policy towards China. The facts of the past two years have shown that the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted a hostile policy towards China. He said that as long as the Kishi Nobusuke government changes this policy, trade between China and Japan is still possible.

Sukegawa Eiichi pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's recent dissemination of the idea of "restoring Sino-Japanese trade" is aimed at deceiving the people, and not truly for the purpose of restoring trade between the two countries. He said: "The demand for the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade is the voice of the broad masses of the Japanese people, and Kishi Nobusuke cannot ignore it. In order to cope with the upcoming elections, Kishi Nobusuke is pretending to say nice things in front of the people and putting on a show for them."

    宿谷荣一谈恢复日中贸易问题
    关键是岸政府改变敌视中国政策
    据新华社讯　日本国际贸易促进协会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一4日对香港报纸记者说：“作为日本国民的一分子，我看到日本政府面对着中国在一个短短期间取得伟大成就的这个事实，还采取敌视中国的政策，实在使我痛心。我认为，日中两国同是亚洲国家，应该互相合作以谋求亚洲的和平。”
    他说，“恢复日中贸易关系的根本关键是岸信介政府改变它敌视中国的政策。”
    宿谷荣一是在2月7日到我国进行了访问以后，4日从广州来到香港的。他对记者说：“我在中国逗留期间，曾经到各地参观。我见到中国建设的成就很大，比我去年4月到中国时发生很大的变化”。他接着指出：“这说明中国不与日本贸易也能把建设搞好，不单在工业方面是这样，而且在农业方面也是这样。实际的情况是中国的政府和人民正在满怀信心地进行建设。”
    宿谷荣一驳斥了那种认为中国对待岸信介政府的态度是“干涉日本内政”的说法。他指出，中国采取这种态度，只是针对岸信介政府敌视中国的政策。过去两年来的事实已经表明，岸信介政府是采取敌视中国的政策的。他说，只要岸信介政府改变这种政策，日中两国之间仍然是可以进行贸易的。
    宿谷荣一指出，岸信介最近散布要“恢复日中贸易”的空气，目的是为了欺骗人民，而不是真正为了要恢复两国间的贸易。他说：“要求恢复日中贸易是日本广大人民的呼声，岸信介不能不理。岸信介为了要应付即将到来的选举，因此他在人民面前假说好话，装出一些样子给人民看看。”
