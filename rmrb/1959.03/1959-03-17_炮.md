    Cannon
    Liu Mianzhi
    Chess players all know how to use the cannon, which is used for long-range attacks. This "cannon" used stones as cannonballs. When Taoranting Park in Beijing was built in 1952, several round stones the size of footballs, and some the size of large soccer balls, were unearthed. It appears they were cannonballs used by the Northern Song Dynasty when attacking the Liao Dynasty.
    From long weapons to long-range killing weapons, the cannon further extended people's arms.
    Using stones as cannonballs and wood as the cannon base, applying the principle of leverage to throw stone balls far away for attacking cities was the most powerful weapon in the Middle Ages. The forms and types of cannon bases were summarized in the "Wujing Zongyao" (Complete Essentials for the Military Classics), compiled around 1044 AD.
    However, the use of stone cannons did not begin in the Song Dynasty. In general, it had a history of about two thousand years, from the 5th century BC to the 14th or 15th century AD.
    According to legend, Fan Li's military tactics in the 5th century BC used flying stones weighing twenty catties, launched five hundred steps by a machine (Note in Pan Yue's "Idle Living Ode," Selections of Refined Literature). During the Three Kingdoms period, there were stone-throwing carts that used machines to turn wheels and launch stones to strike enemy cities, capable of hitting targets hundreds of steps away (Note from "Biography of Ma Jun" in "Records of Xuan" quoted in "Biography of Du Kui," Wei Zhi, Volume 29, Records of the Three Kingdoms). At the end of the Sui Dynasty, Li Mi attacked Luoyang, launching stones with machines, called "General Cannons" (Biography of Li Mi, New Book of Tang, Volume 84). When Emperor Taizong of Tang besieged the palace city of Luoyang, he used large cannons to launch stones weighing fifty catties, throwing them two hundred steps (Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 188). In 645 AD, Li Ji attacked Liaodong city, using trebuchets to throw three hundred catties of stones one li away (Biography of Goryeo, Old Book of Tang, Volume 199). In 956 AD, when Emperor Shizong of Zhou attacked Shouchun, he inspected the naval camp. While crossing a bridge, he dismounted and picked up a stone to be used as a cannon stone in the naval camp, and the officials followed suit, each carrying a stone (Tongjian, Volume 293), using a square boat to carry cannons to attack the city from the Fei River (Historical Records of the Five Dynasties, Volume 33, Biography of Liu Renzhan). When Nong Zhigao attacked Guangzhou during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, he carved stones into round cannons, killing several people with each shot (Sima Guang's Sushui Jiwen, Volume 13). Emperor Renzong of Song attached great importance to this weapon and specially built a cannon field north of Kaifeng, the capital, personally inspecting the practice and building another cannon field west of the city (Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, Volume 177). In 1126 AD, the Jin people besieged Kaifeng, taking the cannon stones prepared by the Song army outside the city and setting up hundreds of cannon racks to attack the city, throwing them like rain. Dozens of Song soldiers were killed by the cannons every day (Ding Teqi's Jingkang Jiwen). When Liu Yu attacked Daming, he used cannon carts to launch broken monuments and remnants of foundations to attack the city. The towers and defenses on the city were destroyed, and the defending soldiers used shields to protect themselves, but many were crushed to death (History of the Song Dynasty, Volume 448, Biography of Guo Yong). Until the end of the Yuan Dynasty, when Xu Da of the Ming Dynasty besieged Suzhou, the rebel general Xiong Tianrui taught the city to make flying cannons. When the wood and stones in the city were exhausted, the ancestral temples and civilian houses were dismantled to make cannon tools (Wu Kuan's Ping Wu Lu). The Ming army also used cannons to attack the city. Zhang Shixin, brother of Zhang Shicheng, supervised the battle on the city tower and was killed by a cannon stone (History of the Ming Dynasty, Volume 123, Biography of Zhang Shicheng, Liu Chen's Early Deeds).
    Cannonballs must be made of stone, but in special circumstances, ice and mud were also used. For example, in 1004 AD, when the Khitans attacked Cangzhou, the city lacked cannon stones, so they used ice as cannon stones to defend the city (Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, Volume 57). When attacking Anzhou, Chen Gui defended firmly, using mud as cannonballs, and the enemy could not conquer it and had to leave (Lu You's Lao Xue An Notes, Volume 5).
    During these thousand years, the cannon was the main weapon for the army to attack strongholds, but around the tenth century AD, gunpowder cannons were also invented, and stone cannons were gradually replaced by gunpowder cannons.

    炮
    刘勉之
    下象棋的人都知道用炮，炮是用于远距离攻击的。这个“炮”，是用石头当炮弹的。1952年北京修建陶然亭公园时，挖出几个像足球大小的圆石头，也有像大皮球大小的，看来是北宋攻辽时所用的炮弹。
    从长武器进一步发展到远距离杀伤武器的炮，人们的手臂又延伸得长一些了。
    用石头作炮弹，用木头作炮床，应用杠杆的原理，把石弹抛得远远的，用以攻城，是中古时代最厉害的武器。炮床的形式、种类，公元1044年左右编成的“武经总要”有总结性的纪录。
    但是用石炮不始于宋，大体上从公元前五世纪到公元十四、五世纪，有两千年左右的历史。
    相传公元前五世纪范蠡兵法，飞石重二十斤，为机发行五百步，（文选潘岳闲居赋注）三国时有发石车，用机鼓轮发石，飞击敌城，可以打到几百步以外（三国志魏志卷二十九杜?传注引传玄记马钧事）。隋末李密攻洛阳，以机发石，号将军礮（新唐书卷八十四李密传）。唐太宗围洛阳宫城，用大礮飞石，重五十斤，掷二百步（资治通鉴卷一八八）。公元645年李勣攻辽东城，用抛车飞三百斤石于一里之外（旧唐书卷一九九上高丽传）。公元956年，周世宗攻寿春，视察水寨，过桥的时候，下马取一石，拿到水寨作礮石，从官也跟着人人搬一块石头（通鉴卷二百九十三）用方舟载礮，从淝水中流攻城（五代史记卷三十三刘仁瞻传）。宋仁宗时侬智高攻广州，把石头琢圆为礮，一发就杀几个人（司马光洓水纪闻卷十三）。宋仁宗很重视这一武器，在京城开封城北，专门修建炮场，亲自检阅练习，又修了一个城西炮场（续资治通鉴长编卷一七七）。公元1126年金人围攻开封，取城外宋军所准备的炮石，立炮架数百攻城，抛掷如雨，宋军中炮死的日不下数十（丁特起靖康纪闻）。刘豫攻大名，用炮车发断碑残础攻城，城上的楼橹都被打坏，守城将士用盾障身，多被碎首（宋史卷四百四十八郭永传）。一直到元朝末年，明徐达围攻苏州，叛将熊天瑞教城中作飞礮，城中的木头石块都用完了，拆祠庙民居为礮具（吴宽平吴录）。明军也用炮攻城，张士诚的兄弟张士信在城楼上督战，被礮石打死（明史卷一二三张士诚传，刘辰国初事迹）。
    炮弹非用石头作不可，但在特殊情况下，也有用冰和泥的，如公元1004年契丹攻沧州，城中没有礮石，就用冰代炮石拒守（续资治通鉴长编卷五十七）攻安州，陈规固守，用泥作礮弹，敌人攻不下，只好走了（陆游老学庵笔记卷五）。
    在这一千多年中，炮是军队攻坚的主要武器，但在公元十世纪左右，应用火药的火炮也发明了，以后石炮就逐步为火炮所代替。
