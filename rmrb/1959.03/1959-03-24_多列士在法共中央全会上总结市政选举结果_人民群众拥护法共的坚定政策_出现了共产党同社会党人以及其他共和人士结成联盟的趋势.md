Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 23rd: Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party Central Committee, emphasized in a recent speech at the Party's Central Committee Plenary Session summarizing the municipal election results, that the main characteristic of the municipal elections was the emergence of a trend of forming alliances between Communists, Socialists, and other Republicans. Thorez said that this was not merely a guiding principle; alliances were formed in many municipalities, and these alliances, especially in the second round of elections, ensured the victory of Republicans in many areas.

    Thorez pointed out that the municipal elections were a measure of the correctness of the Communist Party's policies and strategies. The election results proved that the people supported the Communist Party's firm and clear policy in the struggle against the anti-democratic policies of the ruling parties.

    Thorez then said that the Communist Party's policy of advocating the establishment of a "broader union of left-wing forces" had also stood the test of time. The Communist Party's approach was to establish a united front at the grassroots level, but this did not exclude negotiations and agreements at the upper levels, as such agreements could help to bring them closer together and take practical joint action.

    Thorez continued, "A realistic prospect of changing the status quo has opened up before us... Due to the pressure of the masses, the achievements already made can be expanded, but it cannot be assumed that everything will go smoothly from now on. Power is still in the hands of the enemy, and they are trying to strike at us, but their difficulties will increase, and contradictions will sharpen. And the support of the masses can enable us to fight back."

    In this regard, Thorez called on all Communist Party members to be vigilant against the danger of being blinded by victory. He said, "Only a possibility has opened up before us, a realistic possibility of widely mobilizing the masses to fight for changing the status quo."

    Thorez continued, "Due to the mobilization of the masses, it is possible to raise the issue of restoring democracy very resolutely, pointing out the prospect of electing a constitutional assembly based on proportional representation, and putting on the agenda issues such as abolishing government decrees, defending freedom and non-religious education, and formulating economic and social programs that are not limited to basic demands but more resolutely raise the issue of nationalization."

    Thorez also emphasized that the Communist Party would recently prioritize the struggle to achieve peace in Algeria through negotiations, to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Berlin issue, and to promote France's implementation of an independent foreign policy.

    Thorez then spoke about some conclusions regarding the municipal elections. He said that, first, the election proved the existence of a crisis in the Socialist Party and the weakening of its position. Second, the "various factions" of the Radical Party suffered bankruptcy in this municipal election. Third, the achievements of the candidates of the "Union of Democratic Forces" and the Independent Socialists were not significant. Thorez explained that the "Union of Democratic Forces" and the Independent Socialist parties should not be ignored, but they should not be overestimated. The Communist Party must maintain constant contact with the masses through these parties, but it should not compare its own political policies with the policies they pursue. Thorez said that the main reason for the failure of the "Union of Democratic Forces" and the Independent Socialist Party in the elections was their refusal to fight together with the Communist Party.

    After critically analyzing the views of the leaders of the aforementioned parties, Thorez said that the Communist Party did not want to impose its ideas on anyone. He said, "We demand recognition of objective facts and recognition of the significance of the movement that is irresistibly guiding the working class towards socialism." He finally called for a struggle on two fronts, that is, against the current main danger of right-leaning tendencies, and also against "left"-leaning tendencies, in order to broadly unite workers and democratic forces and successfully complete the Party's tasks.

    多列士在法共中央全会上总结市政选举结果
    人民群众拥护法共的坚定政策
    出现了共产党同社会党人以及其他共和人士结成联盟的趋势
    新华社巴黎23日电　法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士最近在党的中央委员会全体会议上就市政选举结果发言时强调指出，市政选举的主要特点是出现了共产党同社会党人以及其他共和人士结成联盟的趋势。多列士说，这不仅仅是一种方针，在许多市镇成立了联盟，这些联盟特别是在第二轮选举中在许多地区保证了共和人士的胜利。
    多列士指出，市政选举是衡量共产党政策和策略正确性的尺度。选举结果证明，人民群众拥护共产党在反对各执政党派反民主政策斗争中所采取的坚定而明确的政策。
    多列士接着说，共产党主张建立“左翼力量的更广泛的联合”的方针也表明经得起考验。共产党的这种方针是期望建立基层的统一战线，但这也不排斥上层的谈判和协议，因为这样的协议可以帮助彼此接近和采取实际的联合行动。
    多列士接着说，“在我们面前开辟了可能改变现状的现实前景……由于群众的压力，可以扩大已经取得的成果，但是不能认为从今以后事事都将一帆风顺。政权还掌握在敌人的手里，他们企图给我们打击，但是他们的困难将增长，矛盾将尖锐化。而群众对我们的支持可以使我们能够进行反击”。
    多列士在这方面号召全体共产党员警惕胜利冲昏头脑的危险。他说，“在我们的面前只不过是开辟了可能性，广泛动员群众为改变现状而斗争的现实可能性。”
    多列士接着说，“由于群众的动员，可以十分坚决地提出恢复民主的问题，指出根据比例代表制进行制宪议会选举的前途，把废除政府命令、保卫自由和非宗教教育问题、制定不仅限于基本要求、而是更加坚决地提出国有化问题的经济和社会纲领等问题提到日程上来。”
    多列士还强调指出，最近共产党将把通过谈判途径争取阿尔及利亚和平，争取和平解决柏林问题和促使法国执行自主的外交政策的斗争提到首位上来。
    多列士接着谈到了有关市政选举的某些结论。他说，第一，这次选举证明在社会党中存在着危机和它的地位的削弱。第二，在这次市政选举中激进党的“各种派别”遭到了破产。第三，“民主力量联盟”和独立社会党的候选人取得的成就不大。多列士解释说，不应忽视“民主力量联盟”和独立社会党这些党派，但也不应该对它们估计过高。共产党必须通过这些党派同群众不断联系，但是它不应该把自己的政治方针同它们奉行的政策相比。多列士说，“民主力量联盟”和独立社会党在选举中的失败主要原因是它们拒绝同共产党一起进行斗争。
    多列士在批判地分析了上述各党派的领导人的观点以后说，共产党不想把自己的思想强加给任何人。他说，“我们要求承认客观事实和承认正在引导着工人阶级不可遏止地奔向社会主义的运动的意义。”他最后号召在两个战线上展开斗争，即反对当前的主要危险右倾倾向，也反对“左”倾倾向，以便广泛团结工人和民主力量，胜利地完成党的任务。
