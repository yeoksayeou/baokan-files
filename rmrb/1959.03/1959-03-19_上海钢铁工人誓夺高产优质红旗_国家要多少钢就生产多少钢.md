Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 18th: Today, 100,000 steelworkers in Shanghai held a massive "Radio Rally to Respond to the National Steelworkers' High-Yield, High-Quality Competition," expressing their determination to overfulfill the state-assigned steel production plan for Shanghai and ensure the successful realization of the magnificent goal of producing 18 million tons of steel nationwide this year.

    Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said at the radio rally: After the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Conference proposed the task of producing 1.6 million tons of steel in Shanghai this year according to the national plan, the thousands of steel warriors were excited and full of confidence, launched a red flag competition, and a new upsurge in production was rapidly formed. Comrade Li Fuchun's call on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at the "National Steelworkers' High-Yield, High-Quality Competition Radio Rally" gave greater encouragement to the steelworkers in Shanghai. After careful accounting, tapping potential, and serious discussion of the national plan, the workers of each factory believed that they could overfulfill the national plan and make greater contributions.

    Ke Qingshi requested that all steelworkers in the city, under the guidance of the principle of "the whole nation as one chessboard," resolutely ensure that we produce as many tons of steel and steel products as the state needs, guaranteeing only more and not less; we produce whatever types and specifications the state plan requires us to produce, guaranteeing only better and not worse; and we deliver to the state whenever the state plan requires us to deliver, guaranteeing only faster and not slower.

    Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, called on all steelworkers in the city in his speech to take immediate action to continuously improve production levels. He demanded that in terms of output, the city's daily steel output in late March should increase by 70% compared to February, and the second quarter should increase by 90% compared to the first quarter. In terms of quality, during the second quarter, the qualified rate of steel ingots in open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces should reach 98.8%, 97%, and 99% respectively; and in the fourth quarter, they should reach 99.4%, 99%, and 99.8% respectively. In terms of steel product varieties, the number should increase from 2,400 last year to 5,000.

    Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, called on all employees of the design, construction, and installation departments to continue to exert their energy and strive for the upstream, comprehensively implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and successfully complete the capital construction tasks of the steel industry.

    Representatives from various steel plants took the stage one after another to express their determination to the conference. They succinctly and powerfully put forward their leap forward targets and specific measures, determined to achieve greater leaps forward this year. Chen Datong, director of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, said that their goal this year is: to double steel production, increase steel products by 2.7 times, and increase castings by 4.6 times, with one person doing the work of one and a half, to support the needs of national and Shanghai production and construction. They will also produce more steel castings, medium plates, and thin plates to support the needs of the machinery industry and other industries. They will adopt the method of grasping every furnace and every shift to ensure the completion of the plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis.

    The heads of the Shanghai Municipal Materials Department, Transportation Department, and Mechanical and Electrical Industry Department also stated at the meeting: The steel marshal will have raw materials if they need raw materials, equipment if they need equipment, vehicles if they need vehicles, and ships if they need ships. They are determined to go all out to support steel production. The radio rally formed a climax of taking steel as the key link, comprehensive support, and comprehensive leap forward.

    Xu Yan, Director of the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau, stated at the conference that he would guarantee to do everything possible to increase the production of more steel and steel products to support various regions. At the same time, he also hoped that various regions would support Shanghai with more pig iron and other raw materials.

    While listening to the broadcast, workers from various steel plants discussed measures and created new high-yield records in steelmaking and steel rolling. During the radio rally, the factories kept calling the conference to report good news and express their determination to strive for greater leaps forward. For this reason, the conference was interrupted several times to broadcast these production news reports. Inside and outside the meeting, the atmosphere was boiling. After the Wei Xianrong steelmaking team of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 expressed their determination to the conference, they immediately went back to the furnace and fought, smelting a furnace of high-grade alloy steel for casting high-pressure vessels in 5 minutes and 41 seconds, shortening the previous record by 45 minutes and creating a new achievement in rapid steelmaking. After creating a new record of smelting one furnace of steel in 82 minutes on the 16th, the electric furnace of the General Machinery Repair Factory created a newer record of smelting one furnace of steel in 78 minutes today, reporting the good news to the conference.

    上海钢铁工人誓夺高产优质红旗
    国家要多少钢就生产多少钢
    据新华社上海18日电　上海市十万钢铁工人今天上午举行了声势浩大的“响应全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会”，表示决心超额完成国家分配给上海的钢产量计划，保证全国今年产钢一千八百万吨的宏伟指标胜利实现。
    中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施在广播大会上说：上海市委工业会议根据国家计划提出今年上海产钢一百六十万吨的任务后，千万钢铁战士群情振奋，信心十足，开展红旗竞赛，一个新的生产高潮迅速形成。李富春同志代表党中央和国务院在“全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会”上发出的号召，给上海钢铁职工以更大的鼓舞，各厂职工经过算细帐，挖潜力，认真讨论国家计划，都认为可以超额完成国家计划，作出更大的贡献。
    柯庆施要求全市钢铁工人在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，坚决做到国家要我们生产多少吨钢和钢材，我们就生产多少吨钢和钢材，保证只多不少；国家计划要我们生产什么样的品种和规格，我们就生产什么样的品种和规格，保证只好不坏，国家计划要我们什么时候交货，我们就什么时候交给国家，保证只快不慢。
    市委书记处书记曹荻秋在讲话中号召全市钢铁工人立即行动起来不断提高生产水平。他要求产量方面，3月下旬全市钢的日产量要比2月份增加70％，二季度要比一季度增加90％。质量方面，钢锭合格率在二季度内，平炉、转炉、电炉分别要达到98.8％、97％、99％；四季度分别达到99.4％、99％、99.8％。在钢材品种方面要从去年的二千四百种增加到五千种。
    市委书记处书记陈丕显在讲话中号召设计、施工、安装等基本建设部门全体职工要继续鼓足干劲力争上游，全面贯彻多快好省的方针，胜利完成钢铁工业基建任务。
    各个钢厂的代表纷纷登台向大会表示决心。他们简明有力地提出了自己跃进指标和具体措施，决心争取实现今年更大的跃进。上钢三厂厂长陈大同说，今年他们的目标是：钢产量翻一番，钢材增长二点七倍，铸件增长四点六倍，一人顶一人半，支援全国和上海的生产建设需要。还要生产出更多的铸钢件和中板、薄板，支援机械工业和其他工业的需要。他们采取炉炉抓、班班抓，保证按日、按旬、按月完成计划。
    上海市物资部门、交通运输部门、机电工业部门的负责人，也在会上表示：钢铁元帅要原料有原料，要设备有设备，要车有车，要船有船。决心全力以赴，支援钢铁生产。广播大会形成了一个以钢为纲、全面支援、全面跃进的高潮。
