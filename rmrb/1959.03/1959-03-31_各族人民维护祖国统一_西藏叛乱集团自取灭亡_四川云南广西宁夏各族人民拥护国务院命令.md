Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 30th: People in the Tibetan areas of Sichuan Province and Tibetans in Chengdu are angrily condemning the serious crime of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in betraying the motherland and launching an armed rebellion. They also warmly support the central government's measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion and disband the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion.

Hua'er Gongchenglie, Vice Governor of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said: Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our ethnic groups have been united and equal. I have been to Lhasa and personally felt the benefits of the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet for the Tibetan people. The central government has patiently persuaded and educated these reactionary elements in Tibet for a long time, waiting for them to become enlightened, but they are stubborn and have openly colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out rebellion. This is their own destruction. I support the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and disband the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, because this is in the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

Kang Wanqing (Tibetan), Vice Governor of the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, who is currently in Chengdu, also said that the act of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in launching an armed rebellion, betraying the motherland, and betraying the people is intolerable by national law and firmly opposed by the people of the whole country.

Tibetan students from Tibet at the Southwest University for Nationalities are particularly resentful of the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique. The Tibetan girl Longzhong is the sister of Kanqiong Suolang Jiangcuo, a Tibetan official of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region who was killed by the rebels. She burst into tears when she heard the news. She said: I hope the People's Liberation Army will quickly and thoroughly quell the rebellion. I am determined to raise my awareness, study hard, and strive to build a prosperous, democratic, and socialist new Tibet.

Deji Zhuoga, a Tibetan student from Lhasa, said: The Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements can only bring suffering to the Tibetan people. Their rebellion violates the interests of the people of the whole country and the interests of the motherland, and also violates the interests of the Tibetan people. This rebellion will enable the broad masses of Tibetan people to recognize the faces of these traitors and will promote the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland to unite more closely under the leadership of the Party and promote the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 30th: Yunnan minority nationality figures have unanimously condemned the crime of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism and betraying the motherland, and unanimously support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion.

Song Mou (Tibetan), Governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said that the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique shows that they have betrayed the motherland and the Tibetan people. In recent years, they have not only failed to repent, but have regarded the Party's waiting for them to become enlightened as a sign of weakness and deception. He also pointed out: The treason of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique is self-destruction. This incident has educated our Tibetan people and will also promote the early rebirth of Tibet.

Zhao Baohe (Tibetan), the white-haired Deputy Governor, was extremely indignant at the heinous crimes of the traitorous clique, and condemned them as scum of the Tibetan people. He said that he had been to many areas such as Lhasa and Heihe in the past and personally witnessed the painful lives of the Tibetan people under the oppression of feudal serfdom. He said: Since the traitorous clique has broken faith and abandoned the motherland and the Tibetan people, a democratic and socialist new Tibet can come sooner.

Dao Jingban (Dai nationality), Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, said: The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique openly launched an armed rebellion, betraying the motherland and harming the people. This violates the interests of the Tibetan people and endangers the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, which is not allowed by the people and not tolerated by national law. I firmly support the State Council's order to quell the rebellion. The State Council's order reflects the common demands of all ethnic groups.

Gong Shou (Dai nationality), and Lei Chunguo (Jingpo nationality), Deputy Governors of the Autonomous Prefecture, said that from their personal experience since liberation, they felt that without the leadership of the Party, the unity of the motherland, and the unity of all ethnic groups, there would be no happiness and development for minority nationalities. They condemned the heinous crimes of a small handful of Tibetan upper-class reactionary cliques and supported the heroic actions of the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

Pei Aqian (Lisu nationality), Governor of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, said: The Tibetan reactionary clique launched a rebellion, which is their own way to death.

Hu Zhonghua (Kawa nationality), Deputy Commissioner of the Lincang Prefecture, said: The Party and the government have waited for the Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements to become enlightened for eight or nine years, which is truly benevolent and righteous, but they still colluded with imperialism to carry out rebellion, ungrateful and seeking their own death.

Dao Youliang (Dai nationality), and Dao Dongting (Dai nationality), Deputy Governors of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Li Hecai (Hani nationality), Governor of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Hu Yitang (Kawa nationality), member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Yu Haiqing (Yi nationality), County Chief of the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, expressed their warm support for the measures taken by the central government against the Tibetan traitorous clique in their speeches. They pointed out that the unity of the motherland cannot be destroyed, national unity must be consolidated, and the demise of the Tibetan reactionary clique has promoted the rebirth of the broad masses of the Tibetan people.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 30th: People of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are denouncing the heinous crimes of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to carry out armed rebellion, and warmly support the State Council's order on thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion and dissolving the Tibetan local government.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened a symposium this afternoon. The responsible persons of the local organizations of the various democratic parties and the various people's organizations who attended the meeting unanimously believed in their speeches that the Tibetan local government's collusion with imperialism to launch a rebellion, attempting to undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity, is just a futile attempt.

Lin Hu, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Autonomous Region Committee, mentioned in his speech that he had been to Tibet and saw the situation in the Tibetan feudal serfdom society. He said that the patriotic Tibetan people are resolutely safeguarding the unity of the motherland and national unity, and the rebellion of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique is bound to suffer a shameful defeat.

Teachers and students of all ethnic groups at the Guangxi Institute for Nationalities expressed their indignation when they heard the news that Tibetan reactionaries had launched an armed rebellion.

Workers of all ethnic groups in Nanning also condemned the crimes of the Tibetan traitors and warmly supported the State Council's order.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, March 30th: People of all ethnic groups in Yinchuan City, the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, expressed great indignation at the crime of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism and openly launching an armed rebellion. They expressed their firm support for the central government's measures to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion.

Jin Fengshan, Vice Chairman of the Islamic Association of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said that the act of the Tibetan reactionaries in betraying the motherland makes us see their reactionary faces more clearly. Eliminating these traitors will enable the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland to unite more closely. Li Dewang, Deputy Director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of the Autonomous Region, said: "The Tibetan reactionary forces tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and carried out an armed rebellion. This is completely an act of treachery, betraying the motherland, undermining national unity and ethnic unity. The fact that the production and life of the people of all minority ethnic groups in the country have significantly improved in the nine years since liberation proves that the people of all ethnic groups can only have true prosperity and prosperity under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, united in the big family of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland." Ma Wenliang, a standing committee member of the Yinchuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "The Tibetan people and the people of the whole country are united. The conspiracy of a few reactionary elements will never succeed. The rapid suppression of the rebellion shows that the Tibetan people love the Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland."

Workers, peasants, government cadres and street residents in Yinchuan City were even more angry after hearing the news that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique had colluded with imperialism to carry out rebellion. More than 100 representatives who are participating in the first advanced workers' congress of public security, procuratorate and justice in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region held seminars on the evening of the 28th after hearing the news of the Tibetan rebellion from the broadcast to denounce the rebels.

Many mass organizations, workers and peasants in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Yinchuan City also wrote letters to Ningxia Daily on the 29th to denounce the Tibetan rebels and express their respect to the heroic PLA troops stationed in Tibet.
