The Party Committee Secretary of Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine
This year's Great Leap Forward is even more vibrant, and the Tangjiazhuang Mine is full of heroic spirit. The country has arranged for industrialization, and coal production takes the lead. Water mining, water transportation, and water lifting; another hydraulic mine shaft will be built. If materials are lacking, we won't hesitate to ask for them, and we will be responsible for the design and construction ourselves. Construction began in mid-February, with everyone working from dawn till dusk. Red flags flutter on the construction site, and the battle will be completed in five weeks. The newborn dragon will be put into production, with boundless power to stir up rivers and seas. Water mining output will double again, and the national plan will be completed ahead of schedule. (Note) Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine is now actively building a second hydraulic mine.
