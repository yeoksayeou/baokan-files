    Increase Labor Productivity by Onefold
    Guangdong Province Launches a Labor Productivity Improvement Campaign Centered on Tool Reform

    Guangdong Province is striving to double its labor productivity this year to ensure the full realization of this year's leap forward plan.

    The Provincial Party Committee believes that the significant increase in workload and low labor productivity are the main contradictions in achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. The specific manifestation of this difficulty is the shortage of labor. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee believes that we must do everything possible to overcome all kinds of difficulties, fully tap labor potential, and increase labor productivity by onefold or even one and a half-fold this year, so that not only can the yield per unit area of various crops be greatly increased compared to last year, but also the average output per workday can be greatly increased compared to last year. For example, last year, about 70% of the agricultural labor force in the province was engaged in grain production, and each laborer produced about 6,800 jin of grain per year. Based on 300 workdays per year, each laborer produced an average of about 23 jin of grain per workday. If this year 55% of the agricultural labor force is engaged in grain production, and the total output is to be increased by 60% compared to last year, then each laborer must produce 14,000 jin of grain per year, and an average of 47 jin of grain per workday, which is more than double last year's output. The production situation in other departments is the same. Therefore, doubling labor productivity is the key to winning a greater victory this year.

    In order to achieve a twofold increase in labor productivity, the Provincial Party Committee believes that the following measures must be taken:

    First, vigorously carry out tool reform and launch a technical revolution. Focus on reforming several tools that are most widely used, heaviest, and require the most labor in the region, especially transportation and processing tools; and fully utilize natural kinetic energy such as water power, wind power, and biogas to replace manual labor in milling rice, cutting sweet potatoes, and cutting vegetables. Secondly, we must earnestly strengthen the specific leadership of tool reform, and carry out specific and meticulous organizational work on a series of issues such as material supply, design and manufacturing, quality inspection, and technical training. To this end, party committees at all levels must appoint a secretary to be specifically responsible for this work.

    Second, rationally arrange and use the labor force, which is another important measure to improve labor productivity. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that there is a shortage of labor on the one hand, but there is also a great waste of labor on the other hand. Therefore, accurate calculation of the labor force and minimization of waste in the use of labor are of particular importance at present. For example, in the current movement to accumulate and transport fertilizer, in addition to vigorously reforming the tools for collecting, producing, and transporting fertilizer, taking measures such as accumulating fertilizer locally and producing fertilizer locally can greatly save labor in transporting fertilizer.

    Third, adopt technical measures that do not increase the workload or increase a small amount of workload but can increase production more. This is also an effective way to improve labor productivity. For example, the use of improved varieties, rational fertilization, rational irrigation and drainage, timely cultivation, and doing a good job in plant protection, etc., do not require a lot of work, and the output can be significantly increased. Conversely, if the measures in this regard are improper, even if a great deal of effort is spent, the result may still be a reduction in production. Therefore, in order to create higher output per workday, we must widely improve technical measures.

    The Provincial Party Committee believes that the issue of increasing labor productivity has become the key to whether or not we can achieve a greater victory this year. Therefore, the entire province must use its greatest strength to grasp this labor productivity improvement campaign centered on tool reform, and provide a solid material and technical guarantee for a greater victory this year.

    把劳动生产率提高一倍
    广东省以工具改革为中心
    开展提高劳动生产率运动
    本报广州22日电  广东省力争在今年内把劳动生产率提高一倍，以保证今年跃进规划的全面实现。
    省委认为：工作量的大大增加和劳动生产率的低下，是实现今年更大、更好、更全面跃进的主要矛盾。这个困难的具体表现，就是劳动力的紧张。因此，省委认为，想尽一切办法，克服各种困难，充分挖掘劳动潜力，在今年内把劳动生产率提高一倍乃至一倍半，使各种作物不仅单位面积产量能比去年大大增加，而且按每个工作日平均计算的产量，也能比去年大大提高。因此，除了必须把全省农村劳动力按适当比例进行分配，分战线包干完成任务外；还必须对每个劳动力一年生产多少东西，平均每个工作日生产多少东西，提出具体要求，作为奋斗目标。如去年全省约有70％的农业劳动力从事粮食生产，每个劳动力一年生产的粮食约达六千八百斤，按一年三百个工作日计算，平均每个工作日约生产粮食二十三斤。如果今年以55％的农业劳动力从事粮食生产，而总产量要比去年增加60％，这样，每个劳动力一年就要生产粮食一万四千斤，平均每个工作日就要生产粮食四十七斤，即比去年翻一番多。其他各部门生产的情况也是一样。因此，劳动生产率翻一番，是夺取今年更大胜利的关键。
    为了实现劳动生产率翻一番，省委认为必须采取如下的措施：
    第一，大搞工具改革，大闹技术革命。抓住几项本地区使用最广、最笨重和投放劳动力最多的工具，特别是运输工具和加工工具，认真加以改革；并在碾米、切薯、切菜等工作上，充分利用水力、风力、沼气等自然动能代替人力劳动。其次，要切实加强工具改革的具体领导，在材料供应、设计制造、质量检验和技术训练等一系列问题上，进行具体的、细致的组织工作。为此，各级党委必须指定一个书记专管这方面的工作。
    第二，合理安排和使用劳动力，这是提高劳动生产率的另一个重要措施。省委指出，目前劳动力一方面是紧张，但另一方面却又有很大的浪费。因此，精确计算劳动力，最大限度地减少劳动力使用上的浪费，在当前有特别重要的意义。如在目前积肥、送肥运动中，除大力改革采肥、制肥、运肥的工具以外，采取就地积肥、就地制肥等办法，就可以大大节省运肥的劳动。
    第三，采用不增加工作量或增加较少的工作量而能较多增产的技术措施。这也是提高劳动生产率的一项有效办法。如采用良种，合理施肥，合理排灌，适时耕种，做好植物保护等等，并不需要增加很多工作量，产量就能显著增加。反之，如果在这方面措施失当，那怕费了九牛二虎之力，结果还可能减产。因此，为了使每个工作日能创造出更高的产量，就必须广泛改进技术措施。
    省委认为：提高劳动生产率的问题，已成为今年能否取得更大胜利的关键，因此全省必须以最大力量来抓好这个以工具改革为中心的提高劳动生产率运动，为今年更大的胜利提供牢靠的物质保证和技术保证。　　　　　　　　（周方晹）（附图片）
