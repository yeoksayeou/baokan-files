    "Defendant"
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Fang Cheng
    The Dortmund Political Criminal Court in West Germany recently held a trial. The defendant was 150,000 letters from the people of the German Democratic Republic supporting the struggle of Dortmund residents against the deployment of British missiles in the city.

    The courtroom was solemnly arranged, a group of judges sat on the upper side,
    Black robes adorned their figures, each with a stern face to hide.
    Suddenly, a cry rang, "The court is now in session!" Court police were busy,
    A shout thundered, "Bring the defendant!" Bundles of letters piled high!
    The judges questioned with diligence, scrutinizing each word with care,
    Letters, voiceless and still, black ink on white, an unblinking stare.
    The trial swiftly came to its end, pronouncing the "ultimate" decree,
    A single match, the "bullet," ignited, its flames illuminating the court for all to see!
    Absurd? Perhaps not, war-mongers are in fright.
    Though the letters are destroyed, their spirit endures, the people's resolve shines bright!

    “被告”
    天马诗　方成画
    西德多特蒙德市政治刑庭不久前举行了一次审讯，被告是德意志民主共和国人民支援多特蒙德市居民反对英国导弹营进驻该市斗争的十五万封信件。
    法庭布置好威严，一群法官坐上边，
    黑色长袍穿身上，个个都把脸孔板。
    忽听一声叫开庭，忙坏法警一大群，
    ?喝一声被告到，抬来信件几大捆！
    法官审问很认真，一字一句问得清，
    信件不会把话说，白纸黑字瞪眼睛。
    审讯很快就完成，一致判决处“极刑”，
    一根火柴当子弹，火光熊熊照法庭！
    说是荒唐不荒唐，战争贩子太恐慌。
    信件虽毁精神在，人民斗志更昂扬！
