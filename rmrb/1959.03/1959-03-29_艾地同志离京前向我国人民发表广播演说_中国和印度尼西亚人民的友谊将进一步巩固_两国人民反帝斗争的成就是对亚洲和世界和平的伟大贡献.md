Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Before leaving Beijing, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Comrade Aidit, delivered a broadcast speech to the Chinese people. The Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the full recording of Comrade Aidit's speech tonight. The full text of the broadcast speech is as follows:

Heroic Chinese people, dear comrades!

The delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party led by me is about to conclude its visit to China. Through Beijing Radio, on behalf of the delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, and in my own name, I express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people and their leaders for their warm and friendly reception and for introducing us to the development of China.

Comrades!

Although we only visited Beijing and Wuhan during our two weeks in China, we are already very satisfied. During this period, we had the honor of meeting with the main leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, learning about the recent developments in China, and exchanging views on our common task of defending and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

From the talks with the Chinese leaders, we have gained a deeper understanding of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, the large-scale industrial construction currently underway in China, the various efforts in the cultural field, the various measures to improve the people's living standards, the People's Communes, and the prospects of this social organization that has already organized 99% of Chinese farmers.

During our time in China, we visited the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, the Agricultural Exhibition, Renmin University, senior high schools, junior high schools, primary schools, kindergartens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, the Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, residents' committees, the Evergreen People's Commune, the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Beijing Women's Embroidery Production Cooperative, and so on. There are so many things we saw and heard during the entire visit that it is impossible to talk about all our impressions through a radio broadcast.

Our profound impression is that the leaders' ideas and plans for building a strong socialist China and further building a communist society in China, as well as their unified will, have become the Chinese people's ideology, life goals, and unified will. This is not due to anything else, but because what the leadership thinks and does is in line with the people's wishes and needs. The 650 million Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee, and Comrade Mao Zedong are united as one. Their thoughts and actions are consistent in order to build a socialist China and gradually move towards the communist society that mankind has longed for for centuries. Of course, there are difficulties, and there will be more in the future, but for the people, the goal has been clearly defined, and the road to achieving this goal has been pointed out. There is also a guarantee for achieving this goal, which is the unified will of the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tested and tempered in extremely serious struggles. Comrade Zhu De's inscription on the monument at the Ming Tombs Reservoir, "Moving Mountains and Filling the Seas, United as One," is very true.

I would like to take this opportunity to specifically convey the warmest congratulations from the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party and all members of the Indonesian Communist Party to the Chinese peasants, congratulating them on finding the best social organization for building socialism and further building communism in the future. What I am referring to is the social organization that has now organized 500 million Chinese peasants - the People's Commune.

If imperialism does not attack the People's Commune, then it is not imperialism. They say that the People's Commune destroys family life, children are forced to leave their parents, and women must put down their housework to participate in production. This is of course an imperialist lie. They themselves know they are lying, but they always think that someone will believe the lie. Therefore, they sell these lies everywhere.

I think that for Chinese rural women - I know that Indonesian rural women must think this way, and rural women in all countries also think this way - being smoked in the kitchen every day is not paradise. Therefore, if someone insists that the People's Commune should set up public canteens, they are none other than the women who get the support of their husbands. In addition, women are particularly concerned about the People's Commune's addition of kindergartens and nurseries. With these, they can entrust their children when they go to work in the fields, and then take them home after work. Not only Chinese women, not only Indonesian women, I think women in the United States also do not want to carry their children to work in the fields like in the old China era. And this phenomenon still exists in Indonesia and other Asian, African, and Latin American countries.

For women anywhere, living on their husband's income is not happiness. That is why I fully understand why the women in the People's Commune have such great enthusiasm for participating in production, getting wages, and jointly improving the family's living standards with their husbands! How happy are the Chinese women who have the People's Commune as a weapon to completely liberate themselves from the remnants of the dark old society!

Of course, the People's Commune is not only for liberating women, not only for people to eat without paying, not only for children to be well cared for in nurseries and kindergartens. The delegation of the Indonesian Communist Party led by me also saw with their own eyes and directly heard the explanation that the People's Commune, which appeared in 1958 and now includes about 500 million peasants, is a new and dynamic social organization. It is the inevitable development after China implemented land reform, then went through the stage of socialist agricultural production cooperatives, and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The People's Commune combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. This is the most correct social organization for China to strengthen socialism and move towards communism. For China, there is no other easier or faster way to achieve this goal.

I believe that the development of the Chinese People's Commune, following the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, will also have a wide and profound impact on the future progress of our world. This estimate is not an exaggeration.

Comrades:

As the Indonesian Communists and other patriots, including President Sukarno, often say, the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people is not a new friendship. The current friendship is very good, as Brother Sukardjo Wirjopranoto, the recent Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia, said in Jakarta. I am convinced that the great achievements that the Chinese people have recently made and will make in the future will further consolidate this inherent and close friendship. The achievements of the Indonesian people in driving out colonialism, defeating foreign interference led by the United States, and destroying the subversion activities of the imperialists have also consolidated the friendship between Indonesia and China.

In the peaceful labor of the Chinese people building socialism, American imperialism is trying to obstruct it, and in the unification of the whole of China, Taiwan has not yet been liberated. Similarly, the Indonesian people's struggle for complete national independence has also been obstructed by the imperialists led by the United States, and a part of the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, West Irian, is not yet under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia. These facts further consolidate the friendship between Indonesia and China, and further strengthen the will of the two peoples with revolutionary traditions. As Comrade Zhu De said, as long as we are united as one, everything can be done. Socialist China will become stronger and stronger, and Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of its legal owner, China. Similarly, Indonesia will achieve complete national independence, and West Irian will surely be liberated and returned to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.

The achievements of the powerful socialist China and the Indonesian people in the anti-imperialist struggle are a great contribution to Asian and world peace. This contribution, together with the contributions of other Asian people, will surely form a force to establish peace in the Far East as suggested by Khrushchev at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or to realize the establishment of peace among the Pacific Rim countries as suggested by President Sukarno in his speech in Shanghai in October 1956.

Long live the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people, the friendship between the two peoples with revolutionary traditions and love of peace!

Long live socialist China!

May Chinese industry and the People's Communes continue to advance!

Long live Asian and world peace!

    艾地同志离京前向我国人民发表广播演说
    中国和印度尼西亚人民的友谊将进一步巩固
    两国人民反帝斗争的成就是对亚洲和世界和平的伟大贡献
    新华社28日讯印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在离开北京以前向中国人民发表了广播讲话。中央人民广播电台今晚播送艾地同志讲话全文的录音。广播讲话全文如下：英勇的中国人民，亲爱的同志们！
    由我率领的印度尼西亚共产党代表团即将结束在中国的访问。通过北京电台的广播，我代表印度尼西亚共产党代表团，代表印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会，并且以我个人的名义，十分感谢亲切和友好地接待我们并向我们介绍有关中国的发展情况的中国人民及其领导人。
    同志们！
    我们在中国的两个星期，虽然只访问了北京和武汉，就已经使我们感到非常满意。这个期间，我们很荣幸地会见了中国共产党的主要领导人，了解了中国最近的发展情况，并且就我们保卫和巩固亚洲和世界和平的共同任务交换了意见。
    从与中国的领导人的会谈中，我们对于中国社会主义建设中的大跃进，对于现在正在中国大规模进行的工业建设，对于在文化方面的各项努力，对于提高人民生活水平的各种措施，对于人民公社并对这一已经把中国各民族的99％的农户组织起来的社会组织的远景，都有了进一步的了解。
    在中国期间，我们曾经参观了北京电子管厂、农业展览会、人民大学、高级中学、初级中学、小学、幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院、长江大桥、武汉重型机床厂、居民委员会、四季青人民公社、长城、十三陵水库、北京妇女挑花生产合作社等等。在整个访问期间所见所闻甚多，要通过电台的广播来谈我们所有的观感，是不可能的。
    我们获得的深刻印象是：领导者们建设强大的社会主义中国并且进一步在中国建设共产主义社会的思想和计划以及他们的统一的意志，已经成为中国人民群众的思想、生活目标和统一的意志。这不是由于别的，而是由于领导方面所想的和所做的是符合人民的愿望和需要的。六亿五千万中国人民，中国共产党及其中央委员会和毛泽东同志是团结一致的，为了建设社会主义的中国和逐步走向数世纪以来人类所渴望的共产主义社会，他们的思想和行动是一致的。困难当然有，而且今后还会有，但是对人民来说，目标已经明确，以及达到这个目标的道路已经指出来。达到这个目标的保证也有了，这就是在极其严重斗争中久经考验和锻炼的中国共产党领导下的人民的统一意志。朱德同志在十三陵水库的纪念碑上题词说“移山造海，众志成城”这是很对的。
    我想趁这个机会，特地向中国农民转达印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会及印度尼西亚共产党全体党员的最热烈的祝贺，祝贺他们已经找到建设社会主义和在将来进一步建设共产主义的最好的社会组织。我所指的就是这一现在已经组织了五亿中国农民的社会组织——人民公社。
    帝国主义如果不攻击人民公社，那就不是帝国主义了。他们说，人民公社破坏了家庭生活，小孩被迫离开了父母，妇女必须放下家务参加生产。这当然是帝国主义的谎言，他们自己也知道是在撒谎，但他们总认为还有人会相信谎言。因此，他们就到处推销这些谎言。
    我想，对于中国农村妇女来说——我知道，印度尼西亚农村妇女一定是这样认为，各国的农村妇女也是这样认为，每天在厨房给烟熏并不是什么天堂，因此，如果有人坚持人民公社应该设立公共食堂，他们不是别人，而是那些得到她们的丈夫支持的妇女。此外，妇女也特别关心人民公社增设幼儿园和托儿所这件事情。有了这些，他们就可以在下地劳动的时候寄托孩子，劳动完了，再把孩子接回家去。不光是中国妇女，也不光是印度尼西亚妇女，我想，美国的妇女也都不愿意像在旧中国时代那样背着孩子在地里干活。而这种现象，迄今在印度尼西亚和其他亚非国家以及拉丁美洲国家，是仍然存在的。
    对于任何地方的妇女来说，依赖丈夫的收入过活，并不是幸福的。正是因为如此，我充分了解，为什么人民公社的妇女们对参加生产、得到工资并和丈夫一起共同提高家庭的生活水平会有那么巨大的热情！有了人民公社来作为武器，使自己从黑暗的旧社会影响的残余中完全解放出来的中国妇女是多么幸福啊。
    当然，人民公社并不仅是为了解放妇女，不仅是人民可以吃饭不要钱，不仅是使儿童们在托儿所和幼儿园得到很好地养育的地方。我率领的印度尼西亚共产党代表团还亲眼看到，并且直接听到了这样的说明：1958年出现的现在已经包括了大约五亿农民的人民公社，是一个新的富有生命力的社会组织，是在中国实行了土地改革，以后又经过了社会主义的农业生产合作社的阶段，以及社会主义建设大跃进之后的必然发展。人民公社把工、农、商、学、兵结合在一起。这是中国加强社会主义和走向共产主义的最正确的社会组织。对于中国来说，要达到这一目的，比它更容易更迅速的其他道路是没有的。
    我认为，继苏联七年计划之后，中国人民公社的发展，对于目前我们世界今后的进展，也将会有广泛的和深刻的影响。这种估计，是不过分的。
    同志们：
    正如印度尼西亚共产党人以及其他爱国人士包括苏加诺总统在内所经常说的，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊并不是新的友谊，目前这个友谊非常好，正如最近印度尼西亚共和国大使苏卡佐·维约普拉诺托兄在雅加达所说的一样。我深信，中国人民最近和将来所取得的伟大成就将会进一步巩固这个固有的和亲密的友谊。印度尼西亚人民在赶走殖民主义、在打败以美国为首的外国干涉，以及在摧毁帝国主义者的颠复活动中所取得的成就，也同时巩固了印度尼西亚和中国的友谊。
    在中国人民建设社会主义的和平劳动中，美帝国主义企图阻挠，而在统一全中国方面，还有台湾没有解放。同样的，印度尼西亚人民在争取完全的民族独立的斗争中，也受到了以美国为首的帝国主义者的阻挠，印度尼西亚共和国的一部分领土即西伊里安，尚未在印度尼西亚共和国的管辖之下。这些事实进一步巩固了印度尼西亚和中国的友谊，并进一步加强了具有革命传统的两国人民的意志。正如朱德同志所说的，只要众志成城，一切都能够做到。社会主义的中国将日益强大，台湾必将回到它的合法的所有者中国的怀抱。同样的，印度尼西亚将取得完全的民族独立，西伊里安也必将解放，重新归入印度尼西亚共和国版图内。
    强大的社会主义中国和印度尼西亚人民在反帝斗争中所取得的成就，是对亚洲和世界和平的伟大贡献。这个贡献加上其他亚洲人民的贡献，必将形成为建立像赫鲁晓夫在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上所建议的远东和平，或者实现像苏加诺总统1956年10月在上海发表的演说中所建议的建立太平洋沿岸各国间的和平的力量。
    印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊、具有革命传统和热爱和平的两国人民的友谊万岁！
    社会主义的中国万岁！
    中国工业和人民公社继续前进！
    亚洲及世界和平万岁！
