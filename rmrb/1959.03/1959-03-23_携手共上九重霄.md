Hand in Hand to Ascend the Nine Heavens
By Our Shanghai Correspondent

The Shanghai workers have a high style, the Red Flag Competition displays heroic spirit, working together for the entire country, hand in hand to ascend the nine heavens.

This folk song describes the lofty aspirations of Shanghai's million industrial workers in this year's even greater leap forward. These days, the banks of the Huangpu River are filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, bustling and lively. The Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference has just concluded, and the goal of increasing industrial output by another 55% this year has deeply resonated with the people. All walks of life are carrying out Red Flag Competitions, with every industry refusing to lag behind, and everyone striving to be first. Teams submitting battle pledges come one after another, and the celebratory gongs sound louder than the last. Today's Shanghai is truly a world of heroes, with endless tales of remarkable figures, and countless stories of outstanding men and women. Here are some stories of famous figures and their inspiring achievements in the city-wide competition, offering a glimpse of the new style of Shanghai workers in this year's even greater leap forward.

Han Xinliang and Sun Wanyin

March 5th, in the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3.

Just the day before, Han Xinliang's team on Furnace No. 1 had set a record of four hours and twenty-four minutes to refine a furnace of steel.

A few hours later, more good news came from Furnace No. 2: Sun Wanyin's team had set a new record, refining a furnace of steel in just four hours and seventeen minutes.

As soon as they started work that day, these two nationally renowned advanced teams were both ambitious and determined to do it again. The two teams exchanged experiences and worked together to prepare for the shift. Han Xinliang said to Sun Wanyin: "Old Sun, let's work together today, and when we're done, we'll go to the factory headquarters to report the good news together! We've already prepared the gongs and drums!"

As Han Xinliang took over and peered into the furnace with his blue glasses, his heart suddenly skipped a beat: "Oh no, the molten steel is foaming with slag, I'm afraid the quality won't be guaranteed!"

Ensuring quality is paramount! Han Xinliang immediately called his partners: "Quickly notify the smelting furnace to add five tons of molten iron!" After the molten iron was added, the slag slowly settled down, and the quality of the steel was preserved, but the time was extended to five hours and thirty-nine minutes!

Han Xinliang explained the situation to the whole team, and everyone was determined to make up for the lost time. The second furnace started smelting again, and the whole team formed a ring, rapidly and rhythmically throwing the steel material into the furnace. More than ten tons of steel material were all added in ten minutes. The molten steel became increasingly turbulent, and the time for tapping the steel arrived. As the yellow-white molten steel rushed into the steel ladle like a huge fire dragon, the broadcast station announced an exciting piece of good news: Han Xinliang's team had set a new record of four hours and seven minutes to refine a furnace of steel!

"The red flag is planted on Furnace No. 1, hurry up and work harder!" Sun Wanyin's team on Furnace No. 2 worked even harder. Han Xinliang came over and said: "Old Sun, we're waiting for you to report the good news together." Sun Wanyin said confidently: "It can't be wrong, it's guaranteed not to exceed four hours." As soon as he finished speaking, he quickly waved his hand: "Tap the steel!"

"Dang dang..." The bell for tapping steel on Furnace No. 2 rang. The red light reflected the boiling night, and in three hours and fifty-seven minutes, Sun Wanyin's team was ahead again. Two sets of gongs and drums rang out together, and Han Xinliang and Sun Wanyin's two teams walked side by side towards the factory headquarters. It is truly said: The waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves ahead, each wave higher than the last, heroes go to report the good news side by side, the furnace fire and steelworkers reflect each other in red.

Yi Shijuan and Li Sulan

Steelworkers all know Han Xinliang and Sun Wanyin, and textile workers also know Yi Shijuan and Li Sulan. However, Han Xinliang and Sun Wanyin are in the same factory and workshop, while Yi Shijuan and Li Sulan are in the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 and Cotton Mill No. 7 respectively. The great wave of the Red Flag Competition closely connects these two models and their teams, even though they are in two different factories.

Yi Shijuan's team has always been a famous advanced team, and all thirty-odd sisters in the team are as united as one person. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, their performance in production has been even more outstanding!

Li Sulan's team, on the other hand, used to be a backward team in Cotton Mill No. 7, and Li Sulan had only recently been transferred there. The thirty-odd sisters in the team had many different minds. When it came to production, there were four sayings: many broken ends, many cotton waste, low output, and poor quality.

But unexpectedly, Yi Shijuan's team sent a "battle pledge" to Li Sulan's team. The "battle pledge" proposed that the two teams should learn from each other, exchange experiences, and improve together.

Li Sulan's team was both surprised and delighted to receive the "battle pledge". They were surprised that the city's advanced team would challenge a backward team, and delighted that it would be glorious to compete with Yi Shijuan's team.

One late night, Li Sulan's team went to Cotton Mill No. 2 after work. As they entered the workshop, they saw that the sisters of Yi Shijuan's team were as warm and affectionate as a family. The doffers were helping the spinners, and the foreman was also helping the doffers. The sisters of Li Sulan's team all felt a little hot in the face. On the way back, they started criticism and self-criticism on the bus. They had to learn from others! Unity is the only way to do a good job in production. The next day, everyone helped each other and learned advanced operating methods. Two weeks passed, and various production indicators such as cotton waste, broken end rate, and doffing downtime all caught up with or exceeded Yi Shijuan's team!

Yi Shijuan's team was also making progress. They had a slogan: "We can't sit and wait to be caught up!" But they didn't expect to be caught up so quickly: Li Sulan's team had reduced the doffing downtime to thirty-nine seconds. When the news came, the sisters of Yi Shijuan's team immediately rushed to Cotton Mill No. 7 to learn from Li Sulan's team. After several days of hard work and practice, the doffing downtime of Yi Shijuan's team was reduced from forty-one seconds to thirty-eight seconds, realizing the target that Li Sulan's team had planned to achieve on "May Day" before "March 8th"! "March 8th" and "thirty-eight seconds", a pair of "March 8th" good news flew into Cotton Mill No. 7. Li Sulan's team gave up their Sunday holiday and came to learn from the advanced team again, preparing to catch up immediately and surpass them again. There is a poem for this: Sisters fly to the white clouds, younger sisters catch up to the Milky Way, the Weaver Girl opens the door and asks for details, willing to admit defeat and become an apprentice.

Yang Cunlong and Gu Binggen

On the evening of February 26th, the day after Comrade Ke Qingshi announced the grand goals of Shanghai's even greater leap forward this year at the Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference, a group of young men—the members of Yang Cunlong's team—in the tool workshop of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Textile Machinery Factory, were discussing challenging Gu Binggen's team in the same workshop. The young men were full of energy and set up a "Leap Forward Platform" overnight, preparing to send a challenge letter the next day.

When Gu Binggen's team heard about the challenge, although most of the team members were old and weak, they were unwilling to lag behind and also built a "Pioneer Platform" that night.

The "Leap Forward Platform" and the "Pioneer Platform" faced each other in the workshop, and the production targets of both sides were drawn on them with red arrows. On the first day, the results were evenly matched. After three days of hard work, the arrows were still at the same height. Gu Binggen's team then exclaimed: the "old generals" are weak and have little strength, they will definitely not be able to beat the young people, they must work skillfully. As soon as they said it, they did it, and they created a two-purpose homemade milling machine, which turned some manual operations into mechanical operations, doubling the efficiency.

Yang Cunlong's team also worked hard and skillfully on this day, using machinery to replace manual labor, but ultimately failed to catch up with Gu Binggen's team. The old workers gave their homemade milling machine to the young men to use. The young people continued to study and adopted the assembly line operation method, and the arrow on the Leap Forward Platform turned around and surpassed the Pioneer Platform.

Although Yang Cunlong's team had overtaken the "old generals", they took the initiative to propose to the leadership that they take on the heavier workload, so that the "old generals" would not be too strained. Two days later, the red arrows were advancing side by side again.

Now, the two teams are still constantly engaged in technological innovation, constantly eliminating manual operations, learning from and supporting each other. Although the arrows on the two platforms are sometimes high and sometimes low, the result is still rising side by side. There is also a poem for this: Leap forward pioneer two platforms, young workers and old generals compete in talent, technical innovation is frequently exchanged, arrows are difficult to distinguish high and low!

    携手共上九重霄
    本报驻上海记者上海工人风格高，红旗竞赛逞英豪，同为全国棋一局，携手共上九重霄。
    民歌一首，写的是上海百万产业工人在今年更大跃进中的壮志豪情。这几天，黄浦江两岸到处锣鼓喧天，热闹非凡。市委工业会议刚才结束，工业产值今年再提高55％的指标，已经深入人心。各行各业都在开展红旗竞赛，行行不甘落后，个个都要争先，下战表的队伍一队接着一队，报喜的锣鼓一声响似一声。今日的上海，真是英雄们的天下，说不尽的风流人物，写不完男女豪杰。这里写的是全市大竞赛中几对有名的人物，几个耐人寻味的故事，请读者们看一看：上海工人在今年更大跃进中的新风格。
    韩忻亮和孙万银
    3月5日，在上钢三厂平炉工段。
    就在前一天，一号炉韩忻亮小组创造了四小时二十四分钟炼一炉钢的纪录。
    过了几个小时，喜讯又从二号炉上传出，孙万银小组创造了更新的纪录，炼一炉钢只花四小时十七分。
    这天刚上班，这两个全市闻名的先进小组，都雄心勃勃，决心再干一场。两个小组交流了经验，一起做好接班的准备工作。韩忻亮对孙万银说：“老孙，今天我们一起干，干完了一起到厂部报喜，锣鼓我们已经准备好了！”
    接班时，韩忻亮拿起蓝镜片朝炉子里一瞧，心里猛地一跳：“糟糕，钢水起泡沫渣，质量怕保不住！”
    保证质量要紧！韩忻亮立刻招呼他的伙伴：“赶快通知化铁炉，加五吨铁水！”铁水加进后，渣子慢慢平净下去，钢水质量保住了，时间却延长到五小时三十九分！
    韩忻亮把情况向全组作了交代，个个决心要把时间抓回来。第二炉又开始熔炼了，全组排成一个环形圈，飞速地有节奏地把钢料往炉子里扔，十多吨钢料，十分钟就全部加完。钢水越来越沸腾，出钢的时间到了。当黄里透白的钢水像巨大的火龙般冲进盛钢桶时，广播台上传出了震动人心的捷报：韩忻亮小组又创造四小时零七分炼一炉钢的新纪录！
    “红旗插上一号炉了，快加油呀！”二号炉的孙万银小组干得更起劲了。韩忻亮走过来说：“老孙，我们等你一起报喜。”孙万银满有把握地说：“错不了，保险不超过四个钟头”。话刚说完，他迅速把手一挥：“出钢！”
    “当当……”，二号炉出钢钟敲响了。红光辉映着沸腾的黑夜，三小时五十七分，孙万银小组又赶到前面了。两套锣鼓一齐敲起，韩忻亮、孙万银两个小组并肩走向厂部。这真是：长江后浪推前浪，一浪更比一浪高，英雄并肩去报喜，炉火钢人相映红。
    裔式娟和李素兰
    炼钢工人都知道有个韩忻亮和孙万银，纺织工人也都知道有个裔式娟和李素兰。只是韩忻亮和孙万银在同厂同车间，裔式娟和李素兰却分别在国棉二厂和国棉七厂。红旗竞赛的大浪潮，把分在两个厂的这两个模范和她们的小组紧紧结合在一起了。
    裔式娟小组，一向是出名的先进小组，全组三十多个姐妹团结得像一个人。去年大跃进以来，生产上各项成绩更出色了！
    李素兰小组，原来却是七厂的落后组，李素兰刚调去不久。全组三十多个姐妹，好多条心。说到生产，有四句话：断头多，白花多，产量低，质量差。
    但是出人意料，裔式娟小组向李素兰小组下了“战表”，“战表”内提出：两组要互相学习，交流经验，共同提高。
    李素兰小组接到“战表”真是又惊又喜。惊的是：全市先进小组竟向落后小组来挑战；喜的是：跟裔式娟小组竞赛，多么光彩。
    一天深夜，李素兰小组下了班，一起赶到二厂去。走进车间，就看到裔式娟小组的姐妹们亲热得像一家人。落纱工正帮挡车工的忙，工长也在帮落纱工。李素兰小组的姐妹看了，人人脸上都有点发热。回去的时候，在车上就开展起批评和自我批评来了。要向人家学习呀！团结才能搞好生产。第二天，大家就相互帮助，学习先进操作法。两个星期过去了，白花、断头率、落纱停台时间等等各项生产指标，都赶上或超过裔式娟小组了！
    裔式娟小组也在前进。她们有一个口号：“不能坐着等人赶！”但是想不到赶得这样快：李素兰小组落纱停台时间已经缩短到三十九秒。消息传来，裔式娟小组的姐妹们马上赶到七厂，向李素兰小组学习。经过几天的苦学苦练，裔式娟小组落纱停台的时间从四十一秒降到三十八秒，在“三八”节前实现了李素兰小组准备在“五一”节实现的指标！“三八节”、“三十八秒”，一对“三八”的喜讯飞进了国棉七厂，李素兰小组放弃了星期休假，再来向先进小组学习，准备立即赶上去，再超过她们。这有诗一首：姊姊飞向白云天，妹妹赶上银河边，织女启门问端细，甘拜下风做徒弟。
    杨存龙和顾炳根
    2月26日，柯庆施同志在市委工业会议上宣布了今年上海更大跃进的宏伟指标后第二天的晚上，国营上海第一纺织机械厂的工具车间里，一群青年小伙子——杨存龙小组的组员们，正在讨论向同车间的顾炳根小组挑战。小伙子们干劲大，连夜布置了一座“跃进台”，准备第二天送挑战书。
    顾炳根小组一听到要挑战，虽然组员们大多年老体弱，却也不甘落后，当晚也制起一座“先锋台”。
    “跃进台”和“先锋台”在车间里遥遥相对，双方的生产指标都用红色箭头画在上面。第一天，战果不相上下，接连苦干了三天，箭头还是同样高低。顾炳根小组这时嚷开了：“老将”体弱力气小，准要比不过青年人，一定要巧干。说做就做，他们创造了一架两用的土铣床，使部分手工操作变成机械操作，效率提高一倍。
    杨存龙小组这天也是苦干加巧干，用机械代替手工，但终究没有赶上顾炳根小组。老工人们就把自己创造的土铣床让给小伙子们使用。青年人继续钻研，采用了流水作业法，跃进台上的箭头反过来超出了先锋台。
    杨存龙小组虽然赶过了“老将”，却主动向领导上提出：把大生活分给自己做，使“老将”们不致过分吃力。两天过后，红色箭头又齐头并进了。
    现在，两个小组还在不断地搞技术革新，不断地淘汰手工操作的工序，相互学习、支援，两座台上的箭头虽然时有高低，结果还是并头上升。这也有诗一首：跃进先锋两座台，青工老将比雄才，技术革新多交流，箭头难分高和低！（附图片）（苗地插图）
