　　The news about the rational allocation of funds by the Guangfu and two other communes in Wuxian County contains some gratifying figures. The reason it's gratifying is that it embodies the superiority of the commune and demonstrates that the commune has abundant resources and great potential. As long as we actively develop in one area, we can greatly increase income; and by exercising restraint in another area, we can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of yuan in expenses. From this, it seems that if we manage effectively, arrange things rationally, and know how to increase income and reduce expenditure, putting every penny to good use, the prosperity and development of the commune's economy will be limitless.

　　The problem is that there are still many comrades who don't know how to "manage" this large "family," spending money lavishly, wishing that all industries could prosper at once. Some spend money where it shouldn't be spent, while neglecting to spend it where it's needed. Others don't have accurate cost accounting when spending money.

　　We are not generally opposed to spending big money, but we are opposed to blindly and planlessly spending money. The commune has a large and prosperous foundation, and necessary production investment is essential. Without the development of production, there can be no economic prosperity, let alone improved living standards. Therefore, the principle of spending money proposed by the three communes in Wuxian County, which is "under the premise of ensuring production needs and rationally using funds, distinguish between priorities, postpone what can be postponed, reduce what can be reduced, and save what can be saved," is correct.

　　For expenditures that must be made, we must also have a correct attitude, which is to carefully calculate the details and accurately calculate the costs of each expenditure, rationally saving expenses, so that one yuan can be used for the effectiveness of two. This year, Weiting Commune needs 100,000 saplings for building windbreaks. The original estimate was 6 jiao per sapling, but after accurate calculation, each sapling only costs 3 jiao. Reducing 3 jiao per sapling, 100,000 saplings amounts to 30,000 yuan. This shows that to manage the finances of a large commune, even accounts involving a few jiao must be carefully calculated.

　　The Guangfu and other two communes, led by the Party committee secretary, combined the formulation of financial income and expenditure plans with the rational allocation of funds, and used it to promote the development of various economic undertakings of the commune, and promptly prevented and overcame unnecessary expenditures and extravagance. This approach is very good and timely. Doing a good job in financial work universally and conscientiously will provide a more reliable material guarantee for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

### 用大钱　算细账

    用大钱　算细账
    张竞
    吴县光福等三个公社合理安排资金的消息里面，讲了一些可喜的数字。说它可喜，是因为它体现了公社的优越性，说明公社有雄厚的资源，有很大的潜力。只要在某一处积极发展一下，就可以增加很大一笔收入；而在另一处节制一点，又可以省下几万甚至几十万元的开支。由此看来，如果我们经营得法，安排合理，懂得如何开源，如何节流，把每一块钱都用在骨节眼上，公社经济的繁荣和发展将是无可限量的。
    问题是现在还有很多同志不会“当”这个大“家”，用起钱来，大手大脚，恨不得一下子就百业俱兴。也有的是该用的地方不用，不该用的地方却花了不少钱。还有的是用钱没有精确核算。
    我们并不一般的反对用大钱，而是反对盲目无计划的用钱。公社的家大业大，必要的生产投资是一定要用的，没有生产的发展，就谈不到经济的繁荣，更谈不到生活的改善。因此吴县三个公社提出的“在保证生产需要和合理使用资金的前提下，分别轻重缓急，能缓办的就缓办，能少用的就少用，能节省的就节省”这个用钱的原则是正确的。
    对于必须用的开支，也得有一个正确的态度，那就是一定要算细账，要对各项支出做到精确核算成本，合理节约开支，这样就能一块钱顶两块钱的效用。唯亭公社今年造防风林，需要十万棵树苗，原估每棵六角钱，经过精确核算后，每棵只需三角钱。一棵缩减三角钱，十万棵就是三万元。由此说明，管理一个大公社的财务，即使几角钱的账，也得精细地算一算。
    光福等三个公社由党委书记挂帅，把制定财务收支规划和合理安排资金结合起来，并且用它来促进公社各项经济事业的发展，及时防止和克服了不必要的支出和铺张浪费的现象，这种做法很好，而且很及时。普遍认真地做好财务工作，就能使今年的农业生产的更大跃进，获得更可靠的物质保证。
