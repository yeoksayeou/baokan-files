    The Benefits of the "Labor Day Basic Wage System"
    Introducing the Distribution Method of the Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo Commune
    Bian Cao
    In the Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo People's Commune in Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, regarding the distribution system, the commune correctly implements the principle of "equal pay for equal work, more pay for more work" according to labor. Besides implementing the food supply system, the wage part for commune members adopts the "Labor Day Basic Wage System," closely combining the individual interests of commune members with the collective interests, greatly improving the labor enthusiasm of commune members, and promoting the development of productive forces.
    The Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo People's Commune was transformed from the original Xionghuo Advanced Agricultural Cooperative. After the realization of the commune, the management area implemented a distribution system combining wage and supply systems. After a period of practice, and concentrating the opinions of the broad masses of commune members, it finally affirmed the method of adopting the "Labor Day Basic Wage System." They rationally absorbed the beneficial experiences of the previous advanced agricultural cooperative in management and labor remuneration, and developed them on a new foundation.
      The "Labor Day Basic Wage System" is also called
  the "Labor Day Basic Remuneration System of Work Evaluation and Point Recording." Its characteristic is that, based on the strength of each commune member's labor ability and the level of technical skill, the specific number of basic labor days each person must achieve per month is assessed by means of self-reporting, public discussion, and approval by the management area committee, and then the total number of labor days is divided by the estimated reliable total wage amount to calculate each person's monthly basic wage. This
  "Labor Day Basic Wage System" is different from the method of piece-rate quotas, work evaluation and point recording, advance payment at ordinary times, annual settlement, and dividend distribution based on labor days in the past during the advanced agricultural cooperative period. It is also different from the method of setting levels and issuing wages that had been tried. The advantage of taking the method of piece-rate quotas, work evaluation and point recording, advance payment at ordinary times, annual settlement, and dividend distribution based on labor days, besides everyone being familiar with it, and that it is easy to implement, is more importantly that it can improve labor enthusiasm and ensure the quantity and quality of labor; however, the disadvantage is that wages cannot be paid monthly, commune members do not know their income, and some types of work are not easy to set quotas for. The advantage of adopting the method of setting levels and issuing wages is that it is easy to control the number of wages, implement economic accounting, and is simple and easy to implement; however, the disadvantage is that it cannot accurately assess the amount and quality of each commune member's labor, and therefore cannot better encourage the labor enthusiasm of commune members. There is another way to implement grade wages, which is fixed grade, flexible wage. It is a step forward from the previous method. The advantage is that although each commune member has their own wage grade, it must be evaluated at the end of the month when wages are issued. Wage increases for good work and wage reductions for poor work can better encourage commune members' labor emotions; however, the disadvantage is that it still cannot accurately assess each person's actual work performance, especially it cannot achieve equal pay for equal work for commune members of different levels. The "Labor Day Basic Wage System" absorbs the advantages of some of the above methods and makes up for their shortcomings.
    The "Labor Day Basic Wage System" currently adopted by the Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo People's Commune includes the following specific content:
    First, regarding quotas. First of all, based on the weight, technical skill, and distance of agricultural work, sideline work, miscellaneous work, etc., a quantity and quality that a medium-strength labor force can complete in a day is determined as the quota for one labor day (ten work points). Then, the planned number of workers for each unit is determined based on the unified labor day quota and the tasks to be completed by each unit, to achieve a basic balance between tasks, labor force, and labor use between teams.
    Second, regarding the basic labor day wage amount. To make the current wage reliable, we must first make the estimated total wage amount reliable. When determining the total wage amount, there are two options: one is to use the planned net income for 1959, minus the accumulation and supply parts, as this year's estimated total wage amount; the other is to use the actual net income for 1958, minus the public accumulation and food supply parts, plus 10% as this year's estimated total wage amount. The former option is not as reliable as the latter option, and the production level in 1958 was not low, and adding 10% can ensure that commune members' income increases year by year. Therefore, the latter option shall prevail. After determining the estimated total wage amount, when calculating the wage amount for each labor day, 10% should also be drawn from the total wage amount as bonus wages for monthly evaluation and awards; and another 20% should be drawn as accumulated wages, which will be issued at the end of the autumn settlement. Drawing 20% as accumulated wages not only ensures the reliability of commune members' wages, but also has the following benefits: 1. Commune members will receive more distribution at the end of the year, which can adapt to the farmers' habit of spending more money after autumn; 2. It can increase the management area's annual regular revolving funds, which is convenient for expanding reproduction; 3. If some units reduce production due to poor management, the management area can easily conduct unified settlement. Therefore, commune members call this "triple insurance."
    Third, regarding rewards and punishments. For commune members, in addition to determining the basic labor days for each commune member, it is also stipulated that each male laborer should work 28 days per month under normal circumstances, and female laborers should work 25 days per month (excluding rainy days and sick leave) as the basis for attendance assessment. For those who actually work one to four labor days more per month, each additional labor day will be paid according to one and a half labor days; for those who exceed five or more, each additional labor day will be paid according to two labor days (the increased part will be paid from the bonus wages). Those who work a few labor days less will have a few labor days' wages deducted. Although the basic labor days have been reached, those who are absent without reason should be appropriately criticized and educated or punished to strictly enforce labor discipline. The management area implements a "four-determination and one-award" system for each production team, which determines tasks, investment, labor, and commodity production. For the overproduction part of overproducing units, the management area only draws 30%, the remaining 30% goes to the team as a public welfare fund, and 40% is awarded to commune members to increase wage levels. For underproducing units, wages will be deducted according to the reduction, but in order to take care of the living standards of commune members, the maximum deduction cannot exceed 30% of the annual wage.
    Fourth, regarding the wages of cooking, raising livestock, childcare, sewing, and outgoing personnel. It is stipulated that quota contracting shall be implemented based on the number of people eating in the cafeteria, the number of livestock raised, the number of children cared for and educated, and the number of clothes woven. Within each unit, the number of work points obtained from quota contracting is divided according to the basic labor days of each staff member to find out the number of labor days equivalent to each person and ordinary commune members. For personnel who go out to participate in iron and steel production and water conservancy construction, if the factory has other wage regulations, the factory shall pay according to the regulations; if there are no regulations, the number of quotas completed shall be divided according to each person's basic labor days. Evaluated monthly, rewards for good, deductions for bad.
    Fifth, regarding cadre work delays. The previous method of subsidy work was not good enough. If the subsidy is too much, cadres participate less in field labor, and commune members have opinions; if the subsidy is too little, it affects cadres' work and family life. Now it is determined that cadres implement two basic labor days: one is to determine each person's basic work labor days according to the simplicity and complexity of the position and work attitude; the other is to evaluate the basic production labor days according to the strength of labor and the level of technology. Awards for those who actually work more production labor days each month, deductions for those who do not reach. Basic work labor days are evaluated monthly, and rewards or deductions are implemented based on the quality of work. For those who miss production labor days due to special reasons, appropriate care shall be taken after approval by the commune members' representative meeting.
    Sixth, regarding the wages of those who are sick, injured, pregnant, or giving birth. Personnel injured on duty and mothers on leave are paid in full according to their basic labor day wages. Long-term sick people for more than ten days, lactating mothers with babies under one year old, and pregnant women who are more than half a year pregnant, are paid half of their basic wages. If the actual labor days exceed more than half of the full month's basic labor days, the excess part will be rewarded.
    The experience of the Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo People's Commune proves that implementing the "Labor Day Basic Wage System" is a better wage system under the current circumstances. Because it fully embodies the socialist principle of distribution according to labor of equal pay for equal work and more pay for more work, it is conducive to the development of rural production and construction. Now all commune members are in a happy mood and full of energy, and are stepping up preparations for deep plowing cotton fields and other spring plowing and sowing work. This year's wheat field management is also being done more carefully and excellently than in previous years. People are working hard to strive to achieve a wheat yield of 1,500 jin per mu this year.
    The experience of the Xionghuo Management Area of the Xionghuo People's Commune also proves that the implementation of any advanced system must be guaranteed by advanced thinking. Therefore, while determining the implementation of the "Labor Day Basic Wage System," we will continue to strengthen socialist and communist education for commune members, and carry out the "Excellent Commune Member Movement" with the main content of actively working, being innovative, loving the commune, and safeguarding the interests of the commune, and daring to fight against bad people and bad deeds. Conduct regular evaluations and commend advanced individuals. Combine political work with economic work to develop the production and construction of people's communes at high speed.

    “劳动日基本工资制”的好处
    介绍雄火公社雄火管理区的分配办法
    边草
    山西省洪洞县雄火人民公社雄火管理区，在分配制度方面，由于正确地贯彻了同工同酬、多劳多得的按劳分配原则，除实行伙食供给制外，对社员工资部分采取“劳动日基本工资制”，使社员个人利益和集体利益密切结合起来，大大地提高社员的劳动积极性，促进生产力的发展。
    雄火人民公社雄火管理区，是由原来的雄火高级农业社转成的。这个管理区在实现公社化后，执行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，经过一个时间的实践，并集中广大社员群众的意见，最后肯定了采取“劳动日基本工资制”的办法。他们合理地吸收了以前高级农业社的经营管理和劳动报酬的有益的经验，并在新的基础上加以发展。
      “劳动日基本工资制”，也叫做
  “评工记分的劳动日基本报酬制”。它的特点是，根据每个社员劳动能力的强弱，技术水平的高低，以自报公议，管理区委员会批准的办法，具体评定每人每月必须做到的基本劳动日数，然后以总劳动日数去除预计可靠的工资总额，算出每人每月的基本工资。这种
  “劳动日基本工资制”，既不同于过去高级农业社时期的按件定额、评工记分、平时预支、年终结算、按劳动日分红的办法，也不同于曾经试行过的定级别、发工资的办法。采取按件定额、评工记分、平时预支、年终结算、按劳动日分红的办法，好处除了大家都熟悉、都习惯容易执行外，更重要的是能够提高劳动积极性，保证劳动的数量和质量；但缺点是不能按月发工资，社员对自己收入不摸底，有些工种不容易定额计工等。采取定级别、发工资的办法，好处是便于控制工资数、实行经济核算、简单易行；但缺点却是不能准确考核每个社员的劳动数量和质量，因而不能更好地鼓励社员的劳动积极性。采取等级工资还有另一种办法，就是死级别、活工资，它比前一种办法进了一步，好处是虽然各个社员都有自己的工资级别，但月终发工资时必须经过评定，劳动好的提级发工资，劳动不好的降级发工资，可以比较好的鼓励社员的劳动情绪；但缺点还是不能准确地考核每个人的劳动实绩，特别是对不同级别的社员不能做到同工同酬。而“劳动日基本工资制”，则吸取了上面一些办法的长处，又弥补了它们的不足。
    目前雄火人民公社雄火管理区所采取的“劳动日基本工资制”，包括以下一些具体内容：
    第一、关于定额。首先根据农业活、副业活、杂活等等的轻重、技术性强弱、里程远近，定出一个中常劳动力一天所能完成的数量和质量，作为一个劳动日（十分工）的定额。再以统一的劳动日定额和各单位所要完成的任务，确定每个单位的计划用工数，以达到队与队之间的任务、劳力、用工基本平衡。
    第二、关于基本劳动日工资额。要使现行工资可靠，首先要使预计的工资总额可靠。在确定工资总额的时候，有两种方案：一种以1959年的计划纯收入，除去积累和供给部分，即为今年预计工资总额；一种以1958年的实际纯收入，除去公共积累和伙食供给部分，再加10％即为今年预计的工资总额。前一种方案不如后一种方案可靠性大，而且1958年的生产水平并不低，再加10％，又能保证社员收入逐年增加。因此以后一种方案为准。在确定了预计工资总额后，计算每个劳动日工资额时，还需从工资总额中抽出10％作为奖励工资，按月评奖；另抽20％作为积累工资，秋后决算时发。抽20％作为积累工资，不但可以保证社员工资可靠，而且还有以下几点好处：一、社员年终多分配，可以适应农民秋后用钱多的习惯；二、能够增加管理区全年经常的周转资金，便于扩大再生产；三、某些单位因经营不善而减产，管理区便于统一结算。因此，社员叫这是“三保险”。
    第三、关于奖惩。对社员，除确定出每个社员的基本劳动日外，还规定每个男劳动力在通常情况下，每月要出勤二十八天，女劳动力出勤二十五天（雨天、病假在外），作为考勤依据。每月实做劳动日超过一至四个者，每超过一个劳动日按一个半劳动日发工资；超过五个以上者，每超过一个劳动日按两个劳动日发工资（增发部分从奖励工资中开支）。少做几个劳动日，则扣减几个劳动日的工资。基本劳动日虽然达到了，但无故缺勤者，要适当批评教育或处分，以严格劳动纪律。管理区对各个生产队实行定任务、定投资、定工、定商品生产的“四定一奖”制。超产单位的超产部分，管理区只抽30％，其余30％归队作为公共福利基金，40％奖给社员提高工资水平。减产单位则按成扣减工资，但为了照顾社员生活水平，最高不能扣减全年工资的30％。
    第四、关于炊事、饲养、保育、缝纫和外出等人员的工资。规定按在食堂吃饭人数、饲养牲口的头数、保教的幼儿数、纺织衣服件数，实行以单位定额包工。在每个单位内部，按每个工作人员的基本劳动日数去分定额包工所得的工数，求出每个人和一般社员等价的劳动日。外出参加钢铁生产和水利建设的人员，如果工厂另有工资规定，由工厂按规定付酬；如果没有规定，按照每人的基本劳动日去分所完成的定额数。一月一评，好的奖励，不好的扣减。
    第五、关于干部误工。以前实行的补贴工办法不够好。补的多了，干部参加田间劳动少，社员有意见；补的少了，影响干部工作和家庭生活。现在确定干部实行两种基本劳动日：一种是按照职务简繁，工作态度，定出每个人的工作基本劳动日；另一种是按照劳力强弱、技术高低，评定出生产基本劳动日。每月实作生产劳动日超过者奖，达不到者扣减。工作基本劳动日一月一评，根据工作好坏同样实行奖励或扣除。对因特殊原因误工而少作生产劳动日者，经社员代表会核准适当照顾。
    第六、关于病、伤、孕、产者的工资。对因公负伤人员和在假期的产妇，按基本劳动日工资全部发给。对十天以上的长期病号，有一周岁以下婴儿的乳妇，怀孕半年以上的孕妇，发给半数基本工资，如实作劳动日超过全月基本劳动日半数以上者，超过部分给予奖励。
    雄火人民公社雄火管理区的经验证明，实行“劳动日基本工资制”，这是目前情况下比较好的一种工资制度。因为它充分体现了同工同酬、多劳多得的社会主义按劳分配的原则，有利于农村生产建设事业的发展。现在全体社员人人心情舒畅，干劲冲天，正在加紧准备深翻棉田和其他春耕播种工作，今年的麦田管理也比往年做得更细致、更出色，人们正为争取实现今年小麦亩产一千五百斤而努力。
    雄火人民公社雄火管理区的经验也证明，任何一种先进制度的执行，必须要有先进的思想作保证。因此确定在执行“劳动日基本工资制”的同时，继续加强对社员的社会主义和共产主义教育，开展以积极劳动、富有革新精神、爱护公社、维护公社利益而勇于向坏人坏事作斗争为主要内容的“优秀社员运动”，定期评比，表扬先进。把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，高速度发展人民公社的生产建设事业。
