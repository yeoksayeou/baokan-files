Bulgarian "Workers' Affairs" Exposes Tito's Dirty Tricks During His Trip to Asia and Africa.
South Revisionists Vigorously Undermine the Arab Anti-Imperialist Struggle
Attempting to Split the Unity of Socialist Countries and Asian-African Countries

    This Dispatch: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Affairs" published an editorial on the 20th entitled "Why is Yugoslav President So Anxious?" using concrete facts to expose the despicable aims of Yugoslav President Tito's three-month tour of Asian and African countries.

    The editorial said that just as Yugoslavia's domestic economic situation was serious, Yugoslav newspapers launched an unimaginable outcry for Tito's trip. Tito's trip won the cheers of US imperialists.

    The editorial pointed out that Yugoslav revisionists are playing a particularly vile role as assassins in the Arab East. Their activities in this region are clearly serving the imperialists. As everyone knows, the people of Arab countries have been shedding blood for many years to eliminate colonialist enslavement, oppose imperialist oppression, and strive for national independence. All Arab patriots participate in this struggle, and the Arab Communists stand at the forefront of this struggle. The Communists in Arab countries have won the love and respect of the working masses with their selfless patriotic activities, loyalty to national interests, and fearless spirit. They are worthy of being the strongest fighters against imperialism and the most thorough defenders of Arab unity.

    The editorial pointed out that this is precisely what the imperialists and their lackeys do not like. They regard the Communists as their mortal enemies and adversaries. The revisionists in Belgrade played a special role in this regard. Their envoys in the Arab East tried their best to split and weaken the Arab communist movement. They tried their best to peddle the poison of "national communism" secretly, fabricating some special theory of "Arab communism." They tried every possible means to lead the national liberation movements in these countries away from the correct path of resolutely opposing imperialism, especially US imperialism.

    The editorial said that the envoys of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia sent to some Arab countries established close ties with all kinds of adventurers, traitors, and conspirators, and colluded with some leaders of the so-called Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party who played the disgraceful role of right-wing social democrats in the West, as well as other reactionary groups. The Tito clique cooperated with all those who attempted to weaken anti-imperialist forces and undermine the patriotic united front under the slogan of "anti-communism."

    The editorial said that the spearhead of the destructive activities of the Yugoslav revisionists in the Middle East is mainly aimed at the unity of the people of Arab countries and their anti-imperialist struggle. The Tito clique rejoiced at every victory of imperialism and felt sad for their every failure. For example, recently, the freedom-loving people of Iraq crushed the Mosul rebellion instigated by imperialist conspiracies. The purpose of this rebellion was to try to overthrow the revolutionary government of General Kassem, which was trusted by the masses. The newspapers of the Yugoslav pseudo-communists participated in this anti-Arab movement of stirring up trouble. "Borba", "Politika", "Nova Makedonija" and other newspapers were filled with Western news agency reports and other suspicious news and telegrams. These reports completely distorted the situation in Iraq. These reports said that the counter-revolutionary rebellion had not been suppressed, that the rebels were attacking Baghdad, that the Kassem government was collapsing, and other such messages. Yugoslav newspapers did not mention a word about the participation of imperialist and reactionary forces in the rebellion, or the extreme hatred of these forces towards the Republic of Iraq. However, "Borba" openly declared that the reason for the situation in the Middle East was "the strong tendency to link the development of this region with 'bloc politics'." In everyday language, this means that the imperialists and their lackeys have nothing to do with it, and that the socialist camp is to blame for the tense situation in the Arab East.

    The editorial said: "In short, the entire tone of the Yugoslav newspapers' reports and other materials on the situation in Iraq clearly reflects the regret of the Belgrade revisionists for the crushing of the imperialist conspiracy, as well as the hostile attitude towards the revolutionary government of General Kassem."

    The editorial said that the Yugoslav propaganda machine insisted that Tito's trip to Asia and Africa was "for peace and coexistence," saying that it was out of friendship for the people of Asia and Africa. However, it is one thing to say high-sounding words, and it is quite another to do dirty deeds! What Tito and his clique tried their best to conceal with various words has already been revealed by Western newspapers. The American journalist Hobrecht wrote: "Tito's trip to Asia is to counter the communists who exposed him last year." Many bourgeois newspapers reported that Tito, under the guise of neutralism, was trying his best to establish and lead a "third group" that could smoothly confront the socialist camp. The American "Washington Post" wrote in December last year that Tito "is organizing a third force among the neutral countries in Asia, and this force may be beneficial in all aspects."

    The "Workers' Affairs" editorial continued that many facts show that the purpose of Tito's highly publicized trip to Asia and Africa was to undermine and slander the mutual understanding and friendly relations that exist between the socialist camp and the independent countries of Asia and Africa. To turn these countries against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire socialist camp. Facts have proved that Tito's purpose is also to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

    The editorial said that the unity of independent Asian and African countries, their mutual understanding, and their fruitful cooperation with the world socialist system are thorns in the eyes of imperialists and modern colonialists. They want to act as the sole masters of the vast lands of Asia and Africa with endless treasures, as in the past, and hope that the hundreds of millions of residents of Asia and Africa will remain in a state of slavery and colonial dependence. Therefore, they are satisfied with using the slavish service that Tito and his clique are trying their best to provide, and do not hesitate to reward them with dollars.

    The editorial said that the characteristic of Tito's visit to Asian and African countries was the attack on the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp. The Yugoslav president's speeches and the Yugoslav newspapers' attacks on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies, and their condemnation of their peace policies.

    The editorial wrote that the traitors from Belgrade tried their best to dress themselves up as great friends and believers of the famous Bandung Principles, and boasted as if they were also the initiators of the Bandung Principles. However, the principle of peaceful coexistence established at the Bandung Conference and which has become the main basis of the policies of many countries has nothing in common with the pseudo-"non-alignment" policy pursued by the Yugoslav upper echelons. These are two diametrically opposed things. The Bandung Principles are characterized by the pursuit of a policy of peace, neutrality, mutual understanding, cooperation with socialist countries, and solidarity with all peace forces in the world. On the contrary, the "non-alignment" line of the Yugoslav revisionists is to split the forces of peace and democracy and make them stand against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries. This is a line that benefits US imperialism.

    The editorial pointed out that the policies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries towards the neutral countries of Asia and Africa are well known. This is a policy of friendship and cooperation, and a policy of expanding economic and cultural ties on the basis of mutual benefit. The countries of the socialist camp have been watching the development of the newly emerging independent countries with great sympathy, and giving them selfless assistance so that they can improve their economy and culture and strengthen their independence.

    The editorial pointed out that the imperialists and their revisionist servants' conspiracy to slander the equal and friendly relations between socialist countries and independent Asian and African countries, and the conspiracy to undermine the reputation of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries among the people of Arab countries will surely go bankrupt.

    The editorial said that Yugoslav President Tito visited various overseas countries for three months, and finally held talks with the Greek Prime Minister on Rhodes, and successively published crazy slanderous remarks at the Skopje railway station and in Belgrade. In his speech, Tito attacked the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attacked the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and especially attacked the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Albanian Labor Party and their leaders. The editorial said: Why is the president so restless, and why has he revealed his true colors? Because the masks of him and his clique have been taken off, because the world has become clearer about what the Yugoslav revisionists—these modern "Trojan horses" of imperialism—really are, and what they want to do?

### 保“工人事业报”揭露铁托亚非之行的肮脏勾当  南修正主义者极力破坏阿拉伯反帝斗争  妄图分裂社会主义国家同亚非国家团结

    保“工人事业报”揭露铁托亚非之行的肮脏勾当
    南修正主义者极力破坏阿拉伯反帝斗争
    妄图分裂社会主义国家同亚非国家团结
    本报讯　保加利亚“工人事业报”20日以“南斯拉夫总统为什么急躁不安？”为题发表社论，用具体事实揭露南斯拉夫总统铁托在亚非国家所作的为期三个月的游说的可耻目的。
    社论说，正当南斯拉夫国内经济状况严重的时候，南斯拉夫报纸为铁托这次旅行掀起了难以想像的叫嚷。铁托这次旅行博得了美帝国主义者的喝采。
    社论指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者在阿拉伯东方国家扮演着特别卑鄙的暗害者的角色。他们在这个地区所干的勾当显然是为帝国主义者效劳。大家知道，阿拉伯各国人民多年以来一直为消除殖民主义奴役、反对帝国主义压迫、争取民族独立而流血奋斗。所有阿拉伯爱国者都参加这一斗争，而阿拉伯共产党则站在这一斗争的最前列。阿拉伯国家的共产党人以他们奋不顾身的爱国主义活动、对民族利益的忠诚和勇敢无畏的精神博得了劳动群众的爱戴和尊敬。他们不愧为反对帝国主义的最坚强的战士，不愧为阿拉伯团结的最彻底的捍卫者。
    社论指出，这一点恰好是帝国主义者及其走狗所不喜欢的。他们把共产党人看作是自己不共戴天的敌人和死对头。贝尔格莱德的修正主义者在这方面扮演了特殊的角色。他们在阿拉伯东方的使者极力分裂和削弱阿拉伯的共产主义运动。他们竭力偷偷地贩卖“民族共产主义”的毒剂，捏造某种特殊的“阿拉伯共产主义”的理论。他们千方百计地要使这些国家的民族解放运动离开坚决反对帝国主义、首先是反对美帝国主义的正确道路。
    社论说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟派往某些阿拉伯国家的使者同形形色色的冒险家、叛徒、阴谋家建立了密切联系，同扮演西方右翼社会党人不光彩角色的所谓阿拉伯复兴社会党的某些领导人以及其它反动集团勾勾搭搭。铁托集团同所有企图在“反共”的口号下削弱反帝力量和破坏爱国阵线的人合作。
    社论说，南斯拉夫修正主义者在中东进行破坏活动的矛头主要指向阿拉伯各国人民的团结和他们的反帝斗争。铁托集团为帝国主义的每一胜利感到高兴，为他们的每一次失败而感到伤心。例如，最近爱好自由的伊拉克人民粉碎了帝国主义阴谋策动的摩苏尔叛乱。这次叛乱的目的是企图推翻革命的、受到群众信任的卡塞姆将军的政府。南斯拉夫冒牌共产党人的报纸参加了这个兴风作浪的反阿拉伯运动。“战斗报”、“政治报”、“新马其顿报”以及其他一些报纸充满了西方通讯社和其他来路可疑的消息和电讯。这些消息完全歪曲了伊拉克的情况。这些消息说，反革命叛变没有被镇压下去，叛乱者在进攻巴格达，卡塞姆政府正在瓦解以及其他诸如此类的消息。南斯拉夫报纸连一句话都没有提到帝国主义和反动势力参加叛乱以及这些势力极端仇视伊拉克共和国的情况。而“战斗报”则公开宣称，中东局势的原因是“把这个地区的发展同‘集团政策’联系起来的有力倾向”。如果用日常的话来讲，就是说帝国主义者及其走狗与此毫不相干，而阿拉伯东方紧张局势的罪过在于社会主义阵营。
    社论说：“总之，南斯拉夫报纸关于伊拉克局势报道和其他材料的整个调子显然反映了贝尔格莱德修正主义者对帝国主义阴谋被粉碎的惋惜心情，也反映了对卡塞姆将军革命政府的仇视态度。”
    社论说，南斯拉夫宣传机构硬说，铁托的亚非之行是“为了和平与共处”，说什么这是出于对亚非人民的友情。然而，说冠冕堂皇的话是一回事，干肮脏的勾当又完全是另一回事！铁托和他的集团用种种言词所极力掩饰的东西，已经被西方的报纸所透露出来了。美国记者霍布雷奇特写道：“铁托的亚洲之行是为了反击在去年揭他底的共产党人”。许多资产阶级报纸报道说，铁托打着中立主义的幌子，极力要建立和领导一个能够顺利地同社会主义阵营相对抗的“第三集团”。美国“华盛顿邮报”在去年12月写道，铁托“正在亚洲中立国家之间组织第三种力量，这种力量可能在一切方面都是有好处的”。
    “工人事业报”社论继续写道，许多事实表明，铁托这次大事宣扬的亚非之行的目的是：破坏和中伤社会主义阵营同亚非独立国家之间存在的相互了解和友好关系。要使这些国家跟苏联、中华人民共和国和整个社会主义阵营对立起来。事实证明铁托的目的还在于破坏亚非国家在反对殖民主义和帝国主义斗争中的团结。
    社论说，亚非独立国家的团结、它们之间的相互谅解以及它们同世界社会主义体系的卓有成效的合作是帝国主义者和现代殖民主义者的眼中钉。他们想和过去一样充当拥有无尽宝藏的亚非辽阔土地上的唯一主人，希望亚非的数亿居民仍然处于奴隶和殖民地附属地位。因此，他们满意地利用铁托及其集团所尽力而为的奴仆式的效劳，并不惜用美元来犒赏。
    社论说，铁托这次访问亚非国家的特点是攻击苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营。南斯拉夫总统的演说和南斯拉夫报纸对苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家大肆攻击，大骂它们的和平政策。
    社论写道，来自贝尔格莱德的叛徒极力把自己装扮成著名的万隆原则的伟大朋友和信奉者，大肆自吹自擂，好像他们也是万隆原则的首倡者。但是，在万隆会议上确立的和成为许多国家政策主要基础的和平共处原则和南斯拉夫上层所奉行的冒牌的“非集团”政策毫无共同之处。这是两种针锋相对的东西。万隆原则的特点是奉行和平、中立、互相谅解、同社会主义国家合作以及同世界所有和平力量团结的政策。恰恰相反，南斯拉夫修正主义者的“非集团”路线则要分裂和平和民主力量，使它们跟苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他社会主义国家相对立。这是一种对美帝国主义者有利的路线。
    社论指出，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家对亚非中立国家的政策是人所共知的。这就是友好与合作的政策，在互利的基础上扩大经济和文化联系的政策。社会主义阵营各国十分同情地注视着新兴的独立国家的发展，给予它们无私的援助，使它们能够提高自己的经济和文化，加强自己的独立。
    社论指出，帝国主义者及其修正主义者仆从诬蔑社会主义国家和亚非独立国家之间平等和友好关系的阴谋，破坏苏联和其他社会主义国家在阿拉伯各国人民中间的名声的阴谋必遭破产。
    社论说，南斯拉夫总统铁托到远洋各国进行了三个月的访问，最后在罗得岛同希腊首相举行了会谈，并先后在斯科普里市火车站和贝尔格莱德发表了疯狂的污蔑言论。铁托在讲话中，攻击了苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议，攻击了中国共产党的领导人和中国人民，并且特别厉害地攻击了保加利亚共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其领导人。社论说：为什么总统这样神情不安，为什么他原形毕露了呢？因为，他和他的集团的假面具被揭下来了，因为，全世界已经更加清楚地看出，南斯拉夫修正主义者——帝国主义的这些现代的“特洛伊木马”究竟是什么货色，究竟想干什么？
