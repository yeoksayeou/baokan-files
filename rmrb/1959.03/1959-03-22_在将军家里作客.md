Being a Guest at the General's Home
Private First Class Yan Dianyu

At the front of the military guest house, Old Li grabbed my hand: "Come with me quickly, the political commissar is inviting you as a guest."
"Inviting me...?"
"Hurry up, the food is already prepared, the political commissar specifically asked me to invite you!"
At this moment, I hesitated, my heart pounding, my mind filled with questions: "What should I say when I see the political commissar?!..."
Old Li seemed to see through my thoughts. "Don't be restrained when you get there, just be like you are in the squad."
Old Li is the secretary of the Party Committee. Last November, he came to our Eighth Company as a soldier with Political Commissar Wu Rongfeng. Both of them were in our Fifth Squad. In the short month we lived together, we got along very well. In the days and nights of iron smelting at a mine, they got up early and went to bed late just like us, transporting ore, sifting coal, loading kilns, and smashing ore, regardless of the cold and fatigue. Whether it was windy or rainy, they stayed by the iron smelting furnace day and night. You helped me wash clothes, and I poured you foot-washing water... it was as if we had become inseparable old comrades-in-arms. They helped us learn current events, taught us culture, and the political commissar often told us stories of the Long March. We all loved to listen, sometimes until late at night.
I came to the military to participate in a literary creation competition. Before I came, the comrades in the squad repeatedly told me: "After arriving in the military, be sure to go see Old Wu, and send him our squad's greetings." But after arriving in the military, I never had time to visit the political commissar. First, I was busy with meetings, and second, I heard that the political commissar was very busy, attending meetings one day and giving reports the next. Last night, the political commissar saw me at the cinema in the auditorium and asked me to visit him today. I didn't expect him to send Old Li to invite me today. I was truly happy beyond words.
Old Li and I walked side by side. Before long, we arrived outside the political commissar's residence. Entering the corridor, through the glass window, I saw the political commissar was bent over his desk, reading documents. I hesitated for a moment, thinking how busy the political commissar must be. At this moment, I already heard the political commissar's kind and gentle voice: "Come in, old comrade-in-arms."
I hurried in, saluted him, and said, "Hello, Comrade Political Commissar!" The political commissar quickly stood up and shook my hand warmly, offering me a cigarette and pouring tea. I said, "I can do it myself!" The political commissar said with a smile, "How can that be? You are a guest here, and besides, you are an old comrade-in-arms!" I stood there foolishly, holding the teacup, not knowing what to do. The political commissar quickly said, "Sit down, don't be restrained."
Hearing these words reminded me of what the political commissar said when he was about to leave the squad: "In the future, if anyone goes to the military, be sure to visit me, not in the office, but at my home, don't be restrained. At that time, just call me Old Wu!" But it was a little difficult not to be restrained. At this moment, I couldn't remember a single word of the comrades' instructions.
The political commissar spoke first, asking about the situation in the squad and the company. Only then did I remember the comrades' instructions before I came. I said, "All the comrades in the squad asked me to send you their greetings, and also to tell you the good news: our squad achieved a perfect score in combat shooting, and the company also achieved very good results in live-ammunition tactical exercises. The comrades also said that they will always remember your instructions, hold high the banner of the model Fifth Squad, maintain its honor, and carry it forward." As soon as I finished speaking, the political commissar and Old Li both burst out laughing. The political commissar said, "Very good, this is a joy, and I, this soldier of the Fifth Squad, also feel honored!"
The political commissar also asked about the living conditions in the company, and I told him everything in detail, and also told him that Comrade Xie Dexi and Deputy Squad Leader Zheng Manpei had both gone to the sports training team, and now there were only four people left in the squad. The political commissar said with a smile: "Our squad is truly comprehensive. Training is a great leap forward squad, and sports and literary creation are both running ahead." He added: "Go back and tell the comrades, and say I congratulate them." Just then, a middle-aged woman came in, probably the political commissar's wife. She greeted me warmly and said to the political commissar, "The food is ready, you guys eat."
Entering the next room, I saw four dishes and a soup on the table, steaming hot. It seemed that the dishes were specially stir-fried for me, and there was also a bottle of wine on the table. After the political commissar invited me to sit down, he poured me wine. I quickly said, "I can't drink, Comrade Political Commissar!" "It's okay, this is Shanxi's famous wine 'Bamboo Leaf Green', it won't make you drunk." Old Li added from the side: "The political commissar specially bought it from the cooperative." Then, the political commissar raised his glass and said, "Come, let's drink to our squad's perfect score in combat shooting!" I was so moved that I couldn't speak, and drank three glasses of wine in a row.
After finishing the meal, we talked for a while. I knew that the political commissar had many things to do, so I got up to say goodbye. The political commissar walked me to the door and said, "Go back and tell the comrades to write to me often in the future, and don't forget this soldier of the Fifth Squad." I said to Comrade Political Commissar: "I will remember it. After returning to the squad, I will definitely tell the comrades in the squad what you said."
I bid farewell to the political commissar, as if I were leaving my own brother. After walking a long way, I looked back and saw the political commissar was still standing at the door, smiling and waving to me. The sunlight shone on the glass windows, shimmering with colorful light. Clusters of lush green small cypress trees, bathed in the warm sunshine, emitted a fragrant scent.

    在将军家里作客
    上等兵　阎殿玉
    在军人招待所大楼前，老李一把抓住我的手：“快跟我走吧，政委请你作客呢。”
    “请我……？”
    “快走吧，饭菜早已准备好了，政委特地让我来请你的！”
    这时，我犹豫起来了，心里蹦蹦直跳，脑子里打着一个个问号：“见到政委该怎么说呢？！……”
    老李像是看透了我的心。“去了以后别拘束，还像在班里一样。”
    老李是党委会的秘书，去年11月份，随同政委吴融锋将军来到我们八连当兵。他俩都在我们五班，短短一个月的生活中，我们相处的非常好，在某处矿区炼铁的日日夜夜里，他们同我们一样早起晚睡，不顾天寒劳累去运矿、筛煤、装窑和砸矿石，无论刮风下雨，日夜守在炼铁炉旁。你帮我洗衣，我给你倒洗脚水……简直成了不可分离的老战友了。他们帮助我们学时事，教我们学文化，政委还常常给我们讲长征的故事。我们都很爱听，有时一直讲到深夜。
    我是来军里参加文艺创作评比会的，临来时，班里的同志一再嘱咐说：“到军后，一定要到老吴那里去看看，代表全班向他问好。”可到军后一直没去看看政委，一来是开会没时间，二来听说政委很忙，今天开会，明天作报告。昨天晚上在大礼堂看电影，政委看到了我，要我今天到他那里去玩，不想今天他让老李来请我来了，心里真有说不出的高兴。
    我和老李并肩走着，不一会，到了政委的住室外。进了走廊，透过玻璃窗，我看到政委正伏在桌上阅读文件。我迟疑了一下，心想政委多忙呀。这时已听到政委亲切而温存的话音：“快进来吧，老战友。”
    我赶忙进门，向他敬了礼，说：“你好啊，政委同志！”政委连忙起身和我亲切地握手，又递纸烟又倒茶，我说：“我自己来吧！”政委笑着说：“那怎行啊，你到这里是客人呀，再说又是老战友啊！”我端着茶杯，痴痴地站着，不知该怎么是好。政委忙说：“坐下吧，不要拘束。”
    听到这话，又使我想起政委在临离班时说的话：“以后谁要到军里去，一定要到我那里去玩玩，咱们不到办公室，到我家里去，不要拘束。那时，仍叫我老吴好了！”可是，要不拘束可有点难办，同志们嘱咐的话，这会儿连一句也想不起来了。
    倒是政委先开口，问了班里和连里的情况，这时我才想起临来时同志们嘱咐的话，我说：“全班同志要我向你问好，还要我向你报喜：咱们班战斗射击打了个满堂红，连里实弹战术演习成绩也很好。同志们还说，永远记住你的嘱咐，把模范五班的旗帜高高举起，保持荣誉，发扬光大。”我刚一住口，政委和老李都哈哈的笑开了。政委说：“很好，这是一个喜，我这个五班的兵也感到光荣啊！”
    政委又问了连里的生活情况，我一一都告诉了他，还对他说谢得喜同志和副班长郑满培都到体育集训队去了，现在班里只剩四个人，政委笑着说：“咱们班真全面呀，训练是个跃进班，体育和文艺创作都跑在前面”。他又说：“回去告诉同志们，说我向他们祝贺。”正在这时，进来一个中年妇女，大概是政委的爱人，她热情招呼我，并对政委说：“饭好了，你们吃饭吧。”
    进了隔壁的房间，只见桌上摆着四个菜一个汤，热气腾腾的。看样子是特意为我炒的菜，桌上还放了一瓶酒。政委招呼我坐下后就给我斟酒，我忙说：“我不会喝酒呀，政委同志！”“没关系，这是山西名酒‘竹叶青’，不会醉的。”老李又在一旁补充了一句：“这是政委同志特意去合作社买来的。”接着，政委端起酒杯说：“来，为咱们班取得战斗射击满堂红干一杯！”我真感动的说不出话，端起酒杯连喝了三杯。
    吃罢饭，又说了一阵话，我知道政委还有很多事要办，就起身告辞。政委一直送到门口，说：“回去告诉同志们，今后要多给我来信，可别把我这个五班的兵给忘掉了。”我向政委同志说：“我记住了，回班后一定把你的话告诉班里的同志。”
    我告别了政委，像离开了自己的兄长，走了很远，回头一看，政委还站在门口，微笑着向我招手。太阳光照射着玻璃窗，闪耀着五彩的光，一丛丛青绿色的小柏树，沐浴在温暖的阳光下，散发出阵阵的清香。（附图片）
