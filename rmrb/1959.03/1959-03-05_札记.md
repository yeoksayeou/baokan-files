    Notes
    The Moon and Madness
    When Chairman Twining of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the U.S. House Space Committee on March 2nd, he said that the U.S. Air Force had "informally considered the possibility of stationing troops and missiles in orbit around the moon for use in case of war."
    The United States has not yet been able to launch a satellite to the moon, but this top U.S. military official is already talking about stationing U.S. troops and missiles "in orbit around the moon." The extent of the Pentagon madmen's loss of reason has truly reached its peak.
    The imagination of U.S. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Put, is even more astonishing. He said that if the United States could establish missile bases on the moon, even if the enemy annihilated us (referring to the United States) with a sudden attack, our bases on the moon would destroy it.
    In Latin, the prefixes for "madness" and "moon" are the same. Therefore, the American "Stone Weekly" has long suggested that the United States should establish a "Department of Lunacy" in addition to the Army, Navy, and Air Force to "manage space warfare," which would be very suitable for American generals like Twining.
    True Stupidity
    Not long ago, the Prime Minister of the British Rhodesias and Nyasaland, Welensky, said in a statement: "It is foolish to think that exploitation did not exist in the old imperialist era; exploitation did indeed exist. But in many countries that have gained independence, there are currently various forms of large-scale exploitation." The implication is that there seems to be no contradiction between national independence and imperialist exploitation, and the people of Central Africa do not need to oppose the rule of the British Empire.
    However, according to this Prime Minister's logic, "various forms of large-scale exploitation" also "exist" in the United Kingdom. Then, should the United Kingdom be subjected to colonial rule by other countries? The one who is truly stupid is not others, but the Prime Minister himself, who thinks he is clever.

    札记
    月亮和疯癫
    美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁3月2日在美国众议院空间委员会作证时说，美国空军已经
  “非正式考虑了在月球周围的轨道上驻扎军队和导弹以供万一发生战争之用的可能性。”
    美国目前还没有能够发射一颗到月球的卫星，可是这位美国军方最高级官员已经在大谈其要把美国的军队和导弹“驻扎在月球周围的轨道上”了，五角大楼狂人们的丧失理智的程度，真可谓到了家。
    美国空军副参谋长普特中将的想像力，更是惊人。他说，如果美国能够在月球建立导弹基地的话，即使敌人以突然的攻击消灭了我们（指美国），我们月亮上的基地将会消灭它。
    在拉丁文中，“疯癫”和“月亮”的字首是相同的。因此，美国“斯通周刊”早就建议美国除陆军、海军、空军三部外，还应该成立一个“管理空间战争”的机构，定名为“疯癫部”，对于特文宁之流的美国将军们来论，倒是十分合适的。
    真正的愚蠢
    不久以前，英属罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰总理韦伦斯基在一篇声明中说：“以为在旧的帝国主义时代里不存在剥削是愚蠢的，剥削的确存在。但是在许多已经得到独立的国家中，目前也存在着各种各样的大量的剥削”。言外之意是，民族独立和帝国主义的剥削之间，似乎并不存在什么矛盾，中非人民大可不必反对大英帝国的统治。
    但是，按照这位总理先生的逻辑，英国国内也“存在着各种各样的大量的剥削”，那么，英国是不是应该受到别国的殖民统治呢？真正愚蠢的不是别人，而是自以为聪明的总理先生自己。
