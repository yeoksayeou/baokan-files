Participating in Production and Leading Production as Ordinary Laborers

Everyone Praises the New Commune Members
    Our Reporter
    Around the Spring Festival, the Liuzhou Special Zone of Guangxi Province transferred a group of leading cadres to the people's communes to participate in labor and training. The moving deeds of these new commune members are deeply etched in people's minds.

      The Locomotive on the Construction Site
    Zhao Mingqing, the Secretary of the Shilon County Party Committee, who was sent to the Shixiang River water conservancy construction site as a laborer, was exactly the same as the more than 10,000 commune members on the construction site. Every day he carried soil and moved stones, his shoulder never free from the burden; even on rainy days, he was still in the mud and water, braving the wind and cold. Once, he noticed that some laborers started work early, some started late, and the progress of the project was sometimes fast and sometimes slow. What was the reason? He conducted a detailed investigation and found that the production enthusiasm of some of the masses had not been fully mobilized. Therefore, he concentrated the demands of the masses and launched a vigorous labor competition. The daily soil carrying progress of the entire work area quickly jumped from the original 7,100 cubic meters of soil to 8,300 cubic meters, greatly improving work efficiency. The commune members all said with great joy: "Secretary Zhao still has many methods, he can labor and lead, he is really like a locomotive on the construction site."

      Good Secretary, Good Farmer
    One morning before the Spring Festival, Li Jingting, the Secretary of the Yishan County Party Committee, carrying luggage, a sickle, and a bamboo basket, walked to the home of Tan Ruiying, the production team leader of the Happiness Commune, and said with a smile: "Team Leader Tan! The commune has assigned me to your team as a farmer, and in the future, you will lead me to do a good job in production!" Tan Ruiying was momentarily at a loss, how could a County Party Committee Secretary come to be a farmer? He must be joking. While he was half believing and half doubting, Li Jingting urged him to assign work immediately and go to the fields immediately. Tan Ruiying turned it over in his mind and chose a light job, leading him to dig peanuts in the field. A gust of piercingly cold wind blew across the field, turning Li Jingting's face red, and the fingers of a group of women including Tang Meiying, who were working with him, were frozen stiff. The women originally wanted to go back to warm up, but they were thinking about a question: the new commune member is taking the lead, how can the old commune members take the lead in retreating? No one wanted to leave the field.
    Tan Ruiying was very worried that Li Jingting would catch a cold and get sick, so he boiled a basin of water for him to wash his face early the next morning. Who knew that Li Jingting had already gone to the field to work; the third morning, Li Jingting got up even earlier, and went to fetch water with a flashlight at five o'clock, and the water was boiled before dawn. When he saw the production team leader getting up, he immediately poured a basin of hot water for washing his face and personally delivered it to Tan Ruiying. Tan Ruiying was so moved that he didn't know what to say, he only said one sentence: "Good Secretary, you have worked too hard."
    Two days later, the production team was deeply plowing in a big way, and most of the commune members had to go to the fields to turn the soil. Tan Ruiying looked at the heavy double-shared plow and the tall water buffalo, fearing that Li Jingting would be exhausted, and secretly planned to still assign him to dig peanuts. Unexpectedly, Li Jingting spoke first, requesting the team leader to send him to do deep plowing. Tan Ruiying couldn't dissuade him, so he had to choose two honest water buffaloes and let Wei Jingqian, a veteran of double-shared plows, teach him how to operate it. In the field, Li Jingting recognized Wei Jingqian as his teacher, and learned to drive the double-shared plow in half a morning. On the first day, he plowed two and a half acres. When it was time to rest in the evening, Li Jingting was busy reading newspapers to the commune members, explaining the domestic and international situation and the Party's policies. After reading the newspaper, he had to wipe the double-shared plow clean and add grass to the cattle before slowly falling asleep. Li Jingting's approachable style and selfless labor attitude left a deep impression on the commune members, and everyone praised him as a good example for farmers.

        Three New Cooks
    Gui Dianchun, the Director of the Supervision Office of the Luocheng County People's Committee, Wen Yonglin, the Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and Zhao Huagui, the Secretary of the Post Office Branch, and other three veteran Communist Party members, came to the Fengli Canteen of the Red Flag Commune to serve as cooks. This canteen originally had eleven cooks, and more than 400 people ate, but in the past, because leadership was not strengthened in time, the food was not made to the commune members' satisfaction. For example, corn was made into thin porridge alone, sweet potatoes were steamed in strips, and green vegetables, cabbage, and radishes were boiled in one pot, sometimes undercooked and sometimes overcooked, and the commune members had many opinions. Since these three Party members came to the canteen, every piece of work has been renewed. The old cooks said that corn and sweet potatoes should not be cooked together; Wen Yonglin said with a smile: "Yes, if you don't believe me, I'll cook a meal and try it first." He soaked the broken corn in hot water for several hours, first put the sweet potato pieces in the pot and boiled them until soft, then put in the corn. The cooked rice was fragrant, sweet, soft, smokeless, and not undercooked. The commune members were very satisfied after eating it.
    Gui Dianchun and the other three new cooks firmly remembered the Party's instruction to "grasp ideology, grasp production, and grasp life." Every time they ate, they personally went to the table to solicit opinions on improving life. And they encouraged the commune members to do a good job in production and ensure that life would improve step by step. Usually, they ate what the commune members ate, and their lives and work were all integrated with the masses. Therefore, people all praised them in unison as the bright red flag in the canteen. They are good sons of the Party and good servants of the people.

    众口齐夸新社员
    本报记者
    春节前后，广西柳州专区抽调一批领导干部，下放到人民公社参加劳动锻炼。这些新社员的动人事迹，深刻地留在人们的心里。
      工地上的火车头
    下放在石祥河水利工地当民工的中共石龙县委书记赵明清，和工地上一万多名社员完全一样，天天挑土搬石，担不离肩；在落雨的日子里，也仍然是泥里来水里去，不避风寒。一次，他发觉民工当中有的出工早，有的出工晚，工程进度时快时慢。什么缘故呢？他详细地进行了调查访问。发现部分群众生产积极性还没有很好发挥，于是便集中群众要求，开展起轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛。全工区每日挑土进度，迅速由原来的七千一百方土，跃进到八千三百方土，大大提高了工作效率。社员们都兴高采烈地说：“还是赵书记办法多，会劳动又会领导，真像工地上的火车头。”
      好书记、好农民
    春节前的一个早晨，宜山县县委书记李景亭挑着行李、镰刀和竹箕，走到幸福公社生产队长覃瑞英家里，笑着叫道：“覃队长！公社分配我到你们队里当农民，今后你要领导我搞好生产啦！”覃瑞英一时摸不着头脑，怎么一个县委书记来做农民，恐怕是开玩笑。他正在半信半疑，李景亭又催促起来，要求队长马上分配工作，马上下田。覃瑞英心里打了一转，选了项轻便工作，领他到地里挖花生。田野上一阵阵刺骨寒风，把李景亭的脸刮得通红，跟他一起劳动的唐美英等一帮妇女手指冻僵了。妇女们本想回去取一取暖，但是，他们却在想着一个问题：新社员带头上阵，老社员怎么能带头下火线哩！谁也不愿意离开田间。
    覃瑞英很担心李景亭受冻闹病，第二天一早就给他烧了一盆洗脸水，谁知李景亭早已下田出工了；第三天早晨，李景亭起得更早，五点钟就打着手电筒去挑水，烧好水天还没有亮。当他看到生产队长起床时，立即倒了一盆热呼呼的洗脸水，亲自送到覃瑞英身前，覃瑞英感动得不知说什么话才好，只说了一声：“好书记，你太辛苦了”。
    过了两天，生产队里大闹深耕，绝大部分社员都要到田里翻土。覃瑞英看着沉重的双铧犁和一人高的大水牛，唯恐把李景亭累坏了，暗自打算仍然分配他挖花生。不料李景亭先开口，一股劲请求队长派他去搞深耕。覃瑞英劝阻不住，只好选了两头老实水牛，让双铧犁老手韦景乾教他操作。在田野上，李景亭认韦景乾为师，半个早晨即学会驾驶双铧犁，头一天就犁了二亩半，到晚上休息的时候，李景亭又忙着给社员们读报，讲解国内外形势和党的方针政策。读完报，还要把双铧犁擦拭干净，给牛添好草，才慢慢入眠。李景亭这种平易近人的作风和忘我的劳动态度，在社员群众中留下深刻的印象，人人都称赞他是农民的好榜样。
        三个新炊事员
    罗城县人民委员会监察室主任桂殿春、财政局副局长温永林和邮局支部书记赵华桂等三个老共产党员，来到红旗公社凤立食堂担任炊事员。这个食堂原有十一个炊事员，四百多人吃饭，过去因没有及时加强领导，饭菜做得不合社员要求。例如，玉米单作稀粥，红薯成条闷煮，青菜、白菜、萝卜一锅熬，有时夹生，有时熟，社员们有不少意见。自从这三个党员到食堂后，件件工作为之焕然一新。老炊事员们说玉米红薯不能放在一起煮饭；温永林却笑喜喜地说：“能，不信，我先煮一餐试试。”他把碎玉米用热水泡了几个钟头，先将红薯块放在锅里煮软，再放进玉米，煮成的饭又香又甜又软和，既无烟气，也不夹生，社员们吃了都很满意。
    桂殿春等三个新炊事员，牢牢地记着党的
  “抓思想、抓生产、抓生活”的指示，每逢吃饭时间，他们都亲自到桌前征求改进生活的意见。并鼓舞社员大力搞好生产，保证生活步步提高，平时，社员们吃什么，他们也吃什么，生活、工作全和群众打成一片。因此，人们都异口同声赞扬他们是食堂里鲜艳的红旗。是党的好儿子，人民的好勤务员。
