　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 3rd: Yunnan Province's steel production in February exceeded the state plan by 3.4% and 3.9% respectively.

　　February is a month with more holidays and fewer days, an unfavorable objective condition. However, Yunnan Province, due to its early, tight, and firm approach, especially after the provincial party committee promptly organized a major competition involving the steel, coal, transportation, and other five major systems in Kunming, Qujing, Gejiu, and other seven regions in early February, transformed a slow month into a prosperous one. This month's steel production increased by 70% compared to the previous month, and iron increased by 15%.

　　In the mass movement of the major competition, party committees at all levels convened telephone conferences, worker representative conferences, etc., to extensively mobilize and organize the masses, discuss competition conditions, and propose measures, fully preparing from ideological, organizational, and technical perspectives. The Kunming Municipal Party Committee strengthened its leadership over steel production, successively convening cadre meetings and specialized meetings on equipment matching, raw material supply, and chemical analysis, fixed the professional steelmaking teams and production materials, and strengthened raw material management and chemical analysis work. Party committees in Gejiu, Qujing, and other regions also took timely measures to launch red flag competitions.

　　The major competition inspired greater revolutionary enthusiasm among the broad masses of workers. Workers at Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, Yunnan's largest, targeted weak links in production, sought out solutions, and proposed measures to increase steel production. Blast Furnace No. 1 switched from using ores from three locations to using ores from higher-grade mines in Bajie and other two locations, reducing the content of sulfur, phosphorus, and other elements in pig iron. Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant completed the monthly steelmaking plan 15.26% ahead of schedule on February 27th. During this month, they broke the 100-ton daily production mark.

　　In the competition, all major coal mines and highway and railway departments in the province made every effort to support steel production, ensuring the successful completion of the February steel production plan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 2nd: Over 200,000 coal mine workers in Hebei Province overfulfilled the February production plan. Among them, state-owned coal mines' raw coal output exceeded the plan by 3.6% in February, a 60% increase compared to the same period last year.

　　This month, workers in various coal mines in Hebei Province launched a vigorous red flag competition, resulting in a rapid increase in daily production levels. Kailuan Coal Mine's coal output reached more than 49,000 tons on the 25th; Fengfeng Coal Mine's daily output has been consistently maintained above 20,000 tons since February 24th; Jingxing Coal Mine's daily output has also consistently remained above 10,000 tons since the 20th, greatly exceeding the planned targets.

　　In order to promote the in-depth development of the red flag competition movement in coal mines throughout the province and ensure the completion of raw coal production tasks for March and the first quarter, the Hebei Provincial Coal Mine Administration convened a telephone conference at the end of February. Based on the proposals of various units, coal mine workers across the province have further launched inter-mine competitions comparing drive, large-scale bumper harvests, safety, and attendance rates. At the conference, Jingxing No. 4 Mine took the lead in challenging Kailuan and Tangshan Mines, guaranteeing to double the 1959 output compared to last year and ensuring that the state plan is overfulfilled every month; workers at Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Mine, Fengfeng Coal Mine, Xiahuayuan Coal Mine, and other units also proposed at the conference to carry out friendly competitions with coal mines throughout the province and put forward specific competition conditions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 2nd: Workers in the Karamay Oilfield have overfulfilled the state production plan for two consecutive months. The oilfield's drilling, testing, oil extraction, and machine repair plans for February were all completed ahead of schedule by the 28th.

　　This year's production upsurge in the Karamay Oilfield was formed on the basis of continuing to vigorously promote mass movements. In January, the oilfield's party committee led workers in adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, free debate, big-character posters, and thorough discussions on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and this year's state plan, enabling the broad masses of workers to ideologically recognize that this year is a year of even greater leaps forward, thereby further boosting their enthusiasm and overfulfilling the state plan for January. In early February, the oilfield convened the second First Workers' Representative Conference and the Advanced Producer Award Conference. In accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the meeting focused on practical results, examined enthusiasm, discussed leap forward plans and measures, and unanimously passed a proposal to carry out friendly competitions with fraternal oilfields, with the condition of completing this year's drilling, testing, and oil extraction production plans three months ahead of schedule.

　　After the masses of workers in the oilfield fully leaped forward, the oilfield party committee immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the oilfield party committee, proposing six competition conditions: comparing targets and speed, comparing quality and safety, comparing cost reduction, comparing communist large-scale collaboration, comparing technological revolution, and comparing self-reliance in solving raw material and equipment difficulties, organizing a production upsurge in the oilfield. At the same time, leading cadres of the Mining Bureau, the oilfield party committee, and various units went deep into the production front lines to work alongside the workers and lead production in the process. In this way, the entire mine quickly launched a vigorous competition centered on drilling, thereby ensuring the overfulfillment of the February production plan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, March 3rd: The coal army fighting in the Benxi mining area, after overfulfilling the February production plan, is advancing victoriously and has decided to produce an additional 70,000 tons of high-quality coking coal for the country in March, in addition to guaranteeing the completion of the production plan.

　　In recent days, workers in various coal mines in the mining area have successively held leap forward mobilization rallies, with miners resolutely expressing that they will definitely guarantee the realization of this new increased production plan and provide food for the steel industry. Currently, the red flag competition with the content of increasing coking coal production is unfolding deeply in the mining area.

　　In order to ensure the realization of the increased production plan, the Benxi Mining Bureau and the Benxi and Caitun mines, which produce coking coal, as well as various mining areas, have established high-yield command posts and adopted a series of measures. These include organizing rapid tunneling teams, strengthening production preparation work; fully leveraging the efficiency of mechanical equipment, and using coal mining combines and coal cutting machines extensively; promoting and improving new hydraulic coal mining technologies to increase coking coal production. In order to fully leverage equipment efficiency and the potential of coal mining work faces, it has been decided to implement two-shift or three-shift centralized coal mining methods to increase output per unit area and achieve large-scale bumper harvests.

    云南完成二月钢铁任务　河北省煤矿开展矿际竞赛
    克拉玛依油区连战连捷　本溪保证三月增煤七万吨
    本报昆明3日电　云南省2月份钢铁生产，分别超额3.4％和3.9％完成国家计划。
    2月是假期多、日子少的月份，客观条件不利。但是，云南省由于抓早、抓紧、抓狠，特别是2月上旬省委及时组织了昆明、曲靖、个旧等七个地区的钢铁、煤炭、运输等五大系统展开大竞赛以后，淡月变成旺月，这个月的钢产量比上月增加了70％，铁比上个月增加了15％。
    在大竞赛的群众运动中，各地党委都纷纷召开电话会议、职工代表大会等，广泛发动群众和组织群众，讨论竞赛条件、提出措施，从思想上、组织上、技术上充分做好准备工作。中共昆明市委加强了对钢铁生产的领导，相继召开干部会议和设备配套、原料供应、化验分析等专业会议，固定了专业炼钢队伍和生产用料，加强了原料管理和化验分析工作。个旧、曲靖等地区的党委也都及时采取措施，展开了红旗竞赛。
    大竞赛激发了广大职工更大的革命干劲。云南最大的昆明钢铁厂的工人针对生产中的薄弱环节，找窍门、提措施，提高钢铁产量。一号高炉由过去用三处矿石炼铁，改为用品位较高的八街等两个矿的矿石，生铁中的硫、磷等含量都有了下降。昆明第一钢铁厂在2月27日就超额15.26％完成了全月炼钢计划。在这个月中，他们突破了日产百吨大关。
    在竞赛中，全省各主要煤矿和公路、铁路部门都竭尽全力支援钢铁生产，保证了2月钢铁生产计划的胜利完成。
    新华社天津2日电　河北省二十多万煤矿职工超额完成2月份生产计划。其中，国营煤矿的原煤产量，2月份超过计划3.6％，比去年同期增长60％。
    这个月，河北省各个煤矿职工开展了热火朝天的红旗竞赛，因而使日产水平迅速上升。开滦煤矿25日煤产量达到了四万九千多吨；峰峰煤矿自2月24日以来，日产量一直保持在两万吨以上；井陉煤矿从20日以来，日产量也始终保持在万吨以上，大大超过了计划指标。
    河北省煤矿管理局为了推动全省煤矿红旗竞赛运动深入开展，保证完成3月份和第一季的原煤生产任务，在2月底召开了电话会议。根据各单位的倡议，全省煤矿职工已进一步掀起比干劲、比大面积丰收、比安全、比出勤等的矿际竞赛。会上，井陉四矿首先向开滦、唐山矿发起挑战，保证1959年产量比去年翻一番，并且保证月月超额完成国家计划；开滦唐家庄矿、峰峰煤矿、下花园煤矿等单位的职工，也在会上倡议同全省各煤矿开展友谊竞赛，并且提出了具体的竞赛条件。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　克拉玛依石油矿区职工连续两月超额完成国家生产计划。这个矿区2月份的钻井、试油、采油、机修等计划在28日前已全部提前超额完成。
    今年克拉玛依矿区的生产高潮是在继续大搞群众运动的基础上形成的。1月间，矿区党委领导职工采用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方式，广泛深入地讨论了六中全会的精神和今年的国家计划，使广大职工从思想上认识了今年是更大跃进的一年，从而更加鼓足了干劲，超额完成了1月份国家计划。在2月初，矿区召开了首届二次职工代表大会和先进生产者奖励大会。会议根据八届六中全会精神，以虚带实，检查干劲，讨论跃进计划和措施，并且一致通过倡议同兄弟石油矿区开展友谊竞赛，条件是提前三个月完成今年的钻井、试油和采油生产计划。
    矿区党委在职工群众全面跃进起来之后，又立即召开了矿区党委扩大会议，提出比指标和速度，比质量和安全，比降低成本，比共产主义大协作，比技术革命，比自力更生解决原材料和设备困难的六比竞赛条件，在矿区组织生产高潮。同时，矿务局、矿区党委和各单位的领导干部都深入到生产前线，同工人一起劳动，在生产中领导生产。这样，全矿便很快地以钻井为中心展开了轰轰烈烈的竞赛热潮，从而保证超额完成了2月份生产计划。
    新华社本溪3日电　战斗在本溪矿区的煤炭大军，在超额完成2月份生产计划以后，乘胜前进，决定3月份除了保证完成生产计划以外，再为国家增产七万吨优质炼焦煤。
    最近几天，矿区各煤矿的职工都先后举行了跃进誓师大会，矿工们坚决表示一定保证实现这个新的增产计划，给钢铁工业备粮。现在，以增产炼焦煤为内容的红旗竞赛正在矿区深入展开。
    为了保证实现增产计划，本溪矿务局和出产炼焦煤的本溪、采屯两个矿以及各采区，都成立了高产指挥部，同时采取了一系列措施。如组织快速掘进队，加强生产的准备工作；充分发挥机械设备效能，大量使用采煤康拜因和截煤机采煤；推广和提高水力采煤新技术，来提高炼焦煤产量。为了充分发挥设备效能和采煤工作面的潜力，决定实行两班或三班集中采煤办法，以提高单位面积产量，实现大面积丰收。（附图片）
