What Does the Trend of American Monopoly Capitalists Governing in Person Indicate?
Wan Guang

	Rockefeller's Political Ambition
	The political crisis of American imperialism is developing, and one of its manifestations is that more and more American monopoly capitalists are personally coming forward to directly control the state machinery. Since last year, this trend has been accelerating on a larger scale.

	Nelson Rockefeller, one of the leading figures of the Rockefeller monopoly consortium, currently the most powerful in the United States, has taken office as Governor of New York State at the beginning of this year. American bourgeois political history shows that the governorship of New York State is often a stepping stone to further running for President of the United States. Now that Nelson Rockefeller has been elected governor, the farce of "Elect Rockefeller as President," hosted by retired Federal Judge Leffert, has also kicked off. If such a powerful American monopoly capitalist can openly ascend to the presidential throne in two years, it will be an unprecedented first in American presidential history.

	The matter is not limited to Nelson Rockefeller's soaring ambitions. From the Rockefeller consortium to other monopoly consortiums, they all launched a so-called "business into politics" movement last year. National organizations of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, such as the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce, have issued calls in this regard. Many large companies, such as Mellon consortium's Gulf Oil, issued a declaration in September last year that they would "actively participate in politics" in the future. DuPont, Ford Motor Company, and others followed suit. Morgan consortium's General Electric specifically established a "Government Relations Department" in April last year to organize its managers to "participate in political activities." Monopoly capitalists and their confidant managers are not only actively entering central institutions, but also entering local institutions at all levels. A new "training" industry has emerged. An "Effective Citizens Organization," funded by approximately fifty large companies, has established a "workplace" network nationwide to "train business executives to become familiar with the skills of engaging in practical politics."

	Of course, the slogan of "business into politics" is deceptive. American businesses have always been in politics. From Washington to local legislatures, governments, and courts, these have always been the tools of the American bourgeoisie's dictatorship, firmly grasped in their hands. Politicians and military personnel who obediently serve American capitalists have been installed in these ruling institutions batch after batch, taking turns to replace each other. Moreover, since the beginning of this century, with the development of state monopoly capitalism, big capitalists have increasingly personally gone to these institutions. Eisenhower's cabinet, organized after his election as president in 1952, was known as the "cabinet of millionaires," with the number of capitalists reaching an unprecedented peak. According to statistics in mid-1955, out of the 272 senior officials in the Eisenhower government, 150 were capitalists.

	Take Nelson Rockefeller as an example. He has successively served in the Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower administrations as "Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs," Assistant Secretary of State, Director of the International Development Advisory Board, Chairman of the Federal Agency Adjustment Committee, Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Policy. Nelson Rockefeller personally participated in drafting a series of major policy measures in the United States after World War II. After leaving government service, he led the "Rockefeller Brothers Fund Special Studies Project," and last year put forward a series of "reports" on future US military, economic, and political policies. The military report particularly advocated intensifying the nuclear arms race and conducting "limited wars." These policy instructions have been faithfully implemented by Eisenhower and Dulles.

	However, American monopoly consortiums are not satisfied with the current situation, they are not reassured. Nelson Rockefeller also wants to personally ascend to the presidential throne. Many monopoly companies also urgently want to launch a large-scale "participation in politics" campaign.
	Reflection of Political and Economic Crisis
	This is a reflection of the further development of the American political and economic crisis.

	American policy is currently in a comprehensive and profound crisis. In the economic competition between the two systems that most influence the world situation in the contemporary era, the economies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are leaping forward. The Soviet Union has already sounded the magnificent clarion call to comprehensively surpass the United States in material production within twelve years, while the United States is sinking into the quagmire of economic crisis. Terrified by the peaceful competition, the American rulers want to find a way out through war, but in the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the "massive retaliation" strategy that the United States has boasted about for several years has gone bankrupt, and the adventure of conducting "limited wars" in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait last year has also suffered a disastrous defeat. The national independence movement is surging high, and the territory under imperialist rule is shrinking. The leadership position that the United States established in the Western world after World War II has been greatly shaken, its allies are increasingly going their own way, and centrifugal tendencies are growing. In this situation, the mutual complaints, quarrels, and disagreements within the American ruling group are further greatly intensifying. The most aggressive and war-mongering forces among the American monopoly consortiums are increasingly unable to be reassured, and want to personally seize power and make a dying struggle. According to American press reports, Nelson Rockefeller was dissatisfied with the way certain officials in the Eisenhower administration "invited failure" when he resigned from his government post in 1955. He stated that he wanted to "gain power through elections" so that others would completely "listen to him." It is said that the series of reports on American policy put forward by the "Rockefeller Brothers Fund Special Studies Project" last year were also to prepare for his future "statements."

	American monopoly consortiums are consistent on the fundamental policy of foreign aggression and expansion. However, with the deepening of the American economic crisis and the development of the American policy crisis, the differences in the implementation methods and focuses of the various monopoly consortiums, based on their respective interests, are also expanding. For example, the Rockefeller and other consortiums, which have huge interests overseas and profit from arms expansion and war preparation, are making every effort to advocate a large increase in military spending and the intensification of foreign economic expansion backed by "military strength," in order to delay and transfer the economic crisis. They advocate increasing government spending at the expense of fiscal deficits, and using state power on a larger scale to promote the export of capital and commodities. However, the Midwest and other consortiums, which are mainly based on the domestic market or are mainly engaged in civilian industries, oppose further large increases in military spending, and they are even more concerned that the sharp increase in fiscal deficits will lead to economic bankruptcy. The current Eisenhower administration basically implements the policies of the Rockefeller and other consortiums, but at the same time makes certain compromises to the opinions of the Midwest and other consortiums. Nelson Rockefeller was very dissatisfied with the then Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey's advocacy of "tightening the budget," who represented the Midwest consortiums, when he left the government as early as 1955. Nelson Rockefeller's desire to personally govern also reflects the Rockefeller consortium's ambition to absolutely control the government in order to more smoothly promote its foreign policy. Other powerful consortiums are also making every effort to directly control or more forcefully influence government policies in order to realize their own interests.

	In the economic crisis, American state monopoly capitalism is further developing. The monopoly bourgeoisie relies more on government spending (primarily military spending) and other state power to give the economy an injection of stimulants. Not only does the annual expenditure of the American central and local governments, which is around 100 billion US dollars, account for about one-fourth of the annual gross national product, but the government also provides capitalists with all kinds of "benefits" through tax reductions and exemptions, "granting public enterprises," foreign investment "guarantees," and so on. Now capitalists are demanding to participate more in the government in person in order to more reliably divide up government military orders and other "benefits." At the same time, monopoly capitalists occupying key departments in the government can also more favorably eat the small fish with the big fish and squeeze out and merge small and medium-sized enterprises in the crisis. The share of small and medium-sized enterprises in the United States in military production has further declined from 20.9% in 1951 to 16.2% in 1958. There were 10,450 business bankruptcies from January to August 1958, an increase of 12% compared to the same period in 1957. The struggle of 140,000 small and medium-sized enterprises against monopoly capital has been rising recently. The answer of monopoly capital is that they personally come to control the state machine more closely and accelerate this process of capital concentration.

	Due to the development of the economic crisis and the more retrograde domestic and foreign policies of the United States, the dissatisfaction of the American people is generally growing. The American people generally abhor and oppose war. When the American government played with fire in the Taiwan Strait last year, it was strongly condemned domestically. As a result, the Republican Party, which pursued the "brink of war" policy, suffered a disastrous defeat in the election. The American public's movement against fascism is also further developing. In last year's election, extreme right-wing elements within the Republican Party, such as Nolan and Smith, were defeated or retired, and there are few remaining figures who gained power during the heyday of McCarthy fascism. American monopoly capital is making every effort to intensify the transfer of the burden of the crisis onto the working people in the economic crisis, and the workers are also strengthening their struggle. The American labor movement showed its strength in last year's election. In order to prevent the development of the labor movement, monopoly capital formulated bills restricting trade unions, and in the November election last year, six states held referendums on this anti-labor law, but it was rejected by a large majority of votes in five states. According to American bourgeois newspapers, this issue in California and Ohio aroused hatred of capitalists that was "unprecedented since the economic crisis of the 1930s." Trade union organizations in California distributed more than six million leaflets against the anti-labor law. The capital of Ohio held a mass rally of 40,000 union members in early September and established the "Ohio Organized Workers Association." Trade union members in Kansas visited relatives and friends in the countryside, helped farmers with their work, and tried to win their support. Although the American monopoly bourgeoisie still completely controls the state machinery by relying on the two-party system, the forces of undercurrents surging and stirring are strengthening. The entire American ruling class, including the Rockefeller consortium, is therefore extremely fearful. The monopoly capital's "Fortune" magazine said in an editorial in the October issue last year that now is the time for entrepreneurs to "participate in politics" to deal with the "challenge" of the labor movement. If organized labor is allowed to "influence" American politics "at will," "while the managers of companies sit at their desks wringing their hands in sorrow or writing letters to each other, the competitive enterprise system will not exist for long."

	In the crisis of American domestic and foreign policy, a group of politicians cultivated by monopoly capitalists for a long time have lost their reputations. After Roosevelt's death, it was not until the 1952 election that they managed to put up a "World War II hero" Eisenhower, but especially in the past two years, Eisenhower's name has been linked to "brink of war" and economic crisis, and his prestige has plummeted. At present, it is difficult to find a politician in the Republican and Democratic parties who has the so-called "sufficient appeal to run for president." This is the case for presidential candidates, and the same is true for some senior American officials. For example, Dulles has always been a confidant of the Rockefeller consortium, and Nelson Rockefeller praised Dulles last year as "one of the most outstanding secretaries of state the United States has ever had." However, even American newspapers admit that Dulles has become "the most fiercely attacked diplomat in the world." The political agents of the monopoly capitalists are rotting, which is also one of the reasons why the capitalists want to come forward in person.
	Self-Exposing the Deceptive Veil of Democracy
	It is still too early to assert whether Nelson Rockefeller will be elected president in two years. It is naturally not difficult for him to pay huge campaign expenses and gather a group of politicians to wave the flag and shout. Just as he created an unprecedented record of campaign spending of five dimes per vote when running for governor, he may create even higher records in the future. But the problem is that among all the monopoly consortiums in the United States, even if the Rockefeller consortium has jumped to the first place in strength, the United States is still a situation where several consortiums – Morgan, DuPont, Mellon, "First National City Bank of New York," Cleveland, Chicago, and "Bank of America" – are evenly matched. Under normal circumstances, the composition of federal agencies should reflect the power struggles and compromises between these monopoly consortiums. Will the Rockefeller consortium be able to achieve a position of dictating everything in the next two years? What kind of compromise can it reach with other consortiums on the issue of the next presidential candidate? What will be the reaction of the American public to a monopoly capitalist openly running for president? Future developments will answer these questions. In any case, a trend can now be clearly seen: monopoly capitalists are increasingly participating in politics in person.

	The tradition of bourgeois democracy is that capitalists are in the backstage directing, and politicians, military personnel, and congressmen are active in the front stage. This is a form that is more conducive to fooling the people and concealing the essence of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Now, American monopoly capitalists are in a hurry to go from the backstage to the front stage and expose this deceptive veil of "democracy" themselves. This is a manifestation of the weakness, exhaustion, and decline of the American ruling group.

    美国垄断资本家亲自执政的趋向说明了什么？
    万光
    洛克菲勒的政治野心
    美帝国主义的政治危机正在发展，它的一个表现是，越来越多的美国垄断资本家在亲自出马，来直接掌握国家机器。去年来，这种趋向在更大规模上加速进行着。
    美国目前实力最大的洛克菲勒垄断财团的首脑人物之一纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，今年年初已经就任纽约州州长。美国资产阶级政治史表明，纽约州长往往是进一步竞选美国总统的一个阶梯。现在，当纳尔逊·洛克菲勒当选州长后，由退休联邦法官勒法特出面主持的“选洛克菲勒当总统”的闹剧也紧跟着开锣了。假若这样一个美国最有权势的垄断资本家能够在二年后公然登上总统宝座，这在美国总统史上，将是没有前例的第一遭。
    事情不止于纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的勃勃野心。从洛克菲勒财团到其他各个垄断财团，去年就都展开了所谓“企业到政治中去”的运动。美国垄断资产阶级的全国性组织——全国制造商协会和全国商会等，在这方面发出了号召。许多大公司，如梅隆财团的海湾石油公司在去年9月发表了今后要“积极参与政治”的宣言，杜邦公司、福特汽车公司等等也相继作了同样的表示。摩根财团的通用电气公司去年4月专门设立了一个“政府关系部”，为的是组织它的经理们“参与政治活动”。垄断资本家和他们的亲信经理们不仅在积极进入中央机构，而且要进入各级地方机构。一种新的“训练”行业应运而生。大约由五十家大公司资助的一个“有效公民组织”在全国成立了“工作场所”网，来“训练企业负责人员熟习搞实际政治的技巧”。
    当然，所谓“企业到政治中去”的口号是带有欺骗性的。美国企业从来就是在政治中，从华盛顿到各地的议会、政府和法院等一直都是美国资产阶级牢牢抓在手中的专政工具。顺从地为美国资本家服务的政客、军人们一批又一批被安设进这些统治机构里去，轮流接替。而且，从本世纪开始以来，随着国家垄断资本主义的发展，大资本家便日益增多地亲自到这些机构里去。艾森豪威尔1952年当选总统后组织的内阁便有“富豪内阁”之称，其中资本家之多达到了前所未有的高峰。根据1955年年中情况统计，艾森豪威尔政府二百七十二个高级官员里，资本家有一百五十人。
    以纳尔逊·洛克菲勒来说，他曾经连续在罗斯福、杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔三任政府里，先后担任过“美洲事务协调人”、助理国务卿、国际开发顾问局局长、联邦机构调整委员会主任、卫生教育和福利部副部长、总统的外交政策特别助理等。美国在第二次世界大战后的一系列重大政策措施，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒都是亲自参与拟订的。他在离开政府职务后，领导“洛克菲勒基金会特别研究组”，在去年提出了关于今后美国军事、经济、政治等方面政策的一系列“报告”，其中军事报告特别鼓吹要加紧核军备竞赛和进行“有限战争”，这些政策指示基本上都由艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在忠实地执行着。
    但是，美国垄断财团对目前这样的状况还感到不够，不放心。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒还想亲自登上总统宝座。许多垄断公司还要紧迫地开展一个大规模“参与政治”的运动。
  政治经济危机的反映
    这是美国政治经济危机进一步发展的一种反映。
    美国政策目前处在全面的、深刻的危机中。在当代最影响世界局势发展的两种制度经济竞赛中，苏联及其他社会主义国家经济在跃进，苏联已经响起了十二年内在物质生产上全面压倒美国的雄伟号角，而美国却正在陷进经济危机的泥坑中。对和平竞赛恐慌万状的美国统治者想从战争中找出路，但是在东风压倒西风的形势下，美国吹嘘过好几年的“大规模报复”战略破产了，去年在中东和台湾海峡进行“有限战争”的冒险也遭到了惨重失败。民族独立运动在澎湃高涨，帝国主义统治地盘越来越缩小。美国在第二次世界大战后建立的对西方世界的领导地位，已经大大动摇，它的盟国日益自行其是，离心倾向在增长着。在这种情况下，美国统治集团内部的相互埋怨、争吵和分歧，在进一步大大加剧起来。美国垄断财团中最富侵略性和战争狂热的势力，日益不能放心，而要亲自掌握政权，作垂死的挣扎。据美国报刊报道，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在1955年辞去艾森豪威尔政府职务时就对政府某些官员“招致失败”的方法不满，他表示，要“经过竞选当政”，使别人完全“听从他的话”。去年“洛克菲勒基金会特别研究组”提出的一系列关于美国政策的报告，据说也是为他今后的“说法”作准备的。
    美国各个垄断财团在对外侵略扩张的根本政策上是一致的。但是，随着美国经济危机的加深，随着美国政策危机的发展，各个垄断财团从其各自不同的利益范围出发，在政策的执行方法和重点上的分歧也在扩大。例如，在海外有着巨大利益、从扩军备战中发财的洛克菲勒等财团，竭力主张大量增加军费和以“军事实力”为后盾来加紧向外经济扩张，以延缓和转嫁经济危机。他们鼓吹不惜财政赤字来增加政府开支，并且更大规模地运用国家力量促进资本和商品的输出。而以国内市场为主、或者是以经营民用工业为主的中西部等财团，则反对军费再大量增加，他们更加担心财政赤字激增会导致经济破产。目前的艾森豪威尔政府基本上是执行着洛克菲勒等财团的政策，但同时也对中西部等财团的意见有某些妥协。而纳尔逊·洛克菲勒早在1955年离开政府时，就对代表中西部财团的当时财政部长汉弗莱“紧缩预算”的主张很不满意。纳尔逊·洛克菲勒想亲自执政，也是反映出洛克菲勒财团想绝对控制政府，以便更加得心应手地来推行它的对外政策的野心。其他有势力的财团也竭力企图直接掌握或更有力地影响政府的政策，以实现自己的利益。
    在经济危机里，美国的国家垄断资本主义在进一步发展。垄断资产阶级更加依靠政府开支（首先是军事开支）以及其他国家力量，来给经济注射强心针。不仅是美国中央及地方政府每年一千亿美元左右的开支，已经占到每年国民生产总值的四分之一左右，而且，政府还通过减免赋税、“赠与公共企业”、国外投资“保障”等等办法，给予资本家各式各样的“好处”。现在资本家要求更多地亲自参加政府，是为了更牢靠地瓜分政府军事定货以及其他各种“好处”。同时，垄断资本家占住政府中的关键部门，也可以更有利于在危机中大鱼吃小鱼，排挤和兼并中小企业。美国中小企业在军火生产中所占的份额，已经由1951年的20.9％，进一步下降到1958年的16.2％，企业破产倒闭在1958年1月到8月有一万零四百五十家，比1957年同期增加12％。十四万家中小企业反对垄断资本的斗争近来在抬头。而垄断资本的回答是，他们亲自来更加紧密地控制国家机器，加速这种资本集中过程。
    由于经济危机的发展，美国内外政策的更加倒行逆施，美国人民的不满情绪在普遍增长着。美国人民普遍厌恶和反对战争，去年美国政府在台湾海峡玩火时在国内受到十分强烈的谴责。结果，奉行“战争边缘”政策的共和党，在选举中遭到惨败。美国公众反对法西斯化的运动也在进一步发展。去年选举中，共和党内的极右翼分子，如诺兰、史密斯等十一人纷纷落选或见势不妙而退休了，在麦卡锡法西斯主义全盛时期得势的一批人物已经所余无几了。美国垄断资本在经济危机中竭力加紧把危机重担转嫁到工农大众身上，而工人也在加强着斗争。美国工人运动在去年选举里显示了力量。垄断资本为了阻止工人运动的发展，拟订了限制工会的法案，并且在去年11月选举时要六个州就这种反劳工法举行公民投票，结果却在五个州里被绝大多数票所否决。据美国资产阶级报纸报道，这个问题在加利福尼亚州和俄亥俄州激起了“三十年代经济危机以来所不曾有过的”反对资本家的仇恨情绪。加利福尼亚州的工会组织散发了六百多万张反对反劳工法的传单。俄亥俄州首府在9月初举行了四万工会会员参加的群众集会，成立了“俄亥俄州有组织的工人协会”。堪萨斯州工会会员纷纷去拜访农民中的亲戚朋友，帮助农民干活，争取他们支持。虽然，美国垄断资产阶级目前依靠两党制度依然完全控制着国家机器，但是暗流汹涌激荡的力量在加强。包括洛克菲勒财团在内的整个美国统治阶级，因此而极为恐惧。垄断资本的“幸福”杂志去年10月一期的社论说，现在该是企业家“参与政治”来对付工人运动的“挑战”的时候了，如果让有组织的劳工能够“随心所欲地影响”美国政治，“而公司的经理们却坐在他们的写字台前悲痛得使劲扭自己的手或者是彼此写些信，竞争企业制度就不会存在很久”。
    在美国内外政策的危机中，垄断资本家长期培植的一批政客纷纷名声扫地。罗斯福逝世后，到1952年选举里，才好容易抬出一个“第二次世界大战英雄”艾森豪威尔来，但是，特别是近两年来，艾森豪威尔的名字同“战争边缘”和经济危机联在一起，声望一落千丈。目前，在共和、民主两党里，都很难找出一个所谓“有竞选总统的足够号召力”的政客来。总统竞选人是如此，美国一些高级官员也是如此。例如，杜勒斯一直是洛克菲勒财团的亲信，纳尔逊·洛克菲勒去年还称赞杜勒斯是“美国曾经有过的最卓越的国务卿之一”，然而，连美国报纸也承认，杜勒斯已经成为“世界上受到最猛烈攻击的外交家”了。垄断资本家的政治代理人烂下去了，这也是资本家要亲自出马的一个原因。
  自行揭穿骗人的民主帷幕
    现在来断言纳尔逊·洛克菲勒是否将在两年后当选总统，为时尚早。要他支付出巨额竞选费用和搜罗到一批摇旗呐喊的政客，自然是不困难的。像他在竞选州长时创每张选票五角竞选费的空前纪录一样，今后还可能创出更高的纪录来。但是问题在于，在美国所有的垄断财团中，洛克菲勒财团的实力，即使已跃居第一位，可是美国依然是好几个财团——摩根、杜邦、梅隆、“纽约第一花旗银行”、克利夫兰、芝加哥、“美洲银行”等财团势均力敌的局面。在一般情况下，联邦机构组成上是要反映出这些垄断财团间的实力斗争和妥协的。洛克菲勒财团在今后两年里是否能够达到专断一切的地位呢？它同其他财团间能够在下届总统人选问题上达成什么样的妥协呢？美国公众对于一个垄断资本家公开出来竞选总统，又会有什么反应呢？将来事实发展会回答这些问题。不管怎样，现在已经可以清楚地看到一种趋向：垄断资本家在越来越多地亲自参政。
    资产阶级民主制的传统是，资本家居于后台指挥，政客、军人和议员们在前台活动。这是一种更便于愚弄人民、掩饰资产阶级专政实质的形式。现在，美国垄断资本家急忙地要从后台走到前台来，自己来揭开这道骗人的“民主”帷幕了。这是美国统治集团力量虚弱、黔驴技穷和走向没落的表现。
