    Let Each Small Blast Furnace Produce More and Better Iron
    Anhui Small Blast Furnace Iron Smelting Conference Proposes Competition
    Hunan Province Launches a New Steel Production Campaign
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Anhui Daily, the Anhui Provincial Department of Metallurgical Industry recently held a small blast furnace iron smelting conference, exchanging technical experiences and studying production issues, and issued a competition proposal to all iron smelting workers in the province to ensure the victorious completion of this year's pig iron production tasks.
    Since last year, Anhui Province has been vigorously developing the steel industry with the participation of the entire party and all the people. While building small indigenous blast furnaces, it has also focused on the construction of small modern blast furnaces. By the end of January this year, the province had built 891 small modern blast furnaces, of which 496 had been put into production, and 350 were still under construction. The total volume of these small blast furnaces is more than 13,000 cubic meters. In January this year, a total of 72,753 tons of pig iron were produced, accounting for 74.3% of the province's total output in January. The production of small blast furnaces that have been put into production is gradually becoming normal, the technical barrier has been broken in most areas, the unit output of each furnace and the quality of pig iron have been improved compared with before, and the coke ratio and cost are also gradually decreasing.
    According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the meeting examined the main problems currently existing in small blast furnace iron smelting. The meeting believed that although the production and construction of small blast furnaces in the province have achieved great results, there are still problems such as high coke ratio, unstable quality, excessive personnel, high cost, and unsound management system. In response to these problems, the participants conducted full research and discussion and exchanged experiences, and put forward a series of improvement measures, requiring the strengthening of management in production to achieve "three highs, one reduction, and two lows," that is, improving technology, increasing output, improving quality, reducing personnel, lowering the coke ratio, and reducing costs, so as to achieve more and better iron production from each small blast furnace.
    The meeting believed that strengthening production management is an important factor in increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs, and required all iron smelting units to establish and strengthen various production systems, and conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" management system.
    In order to ensure the completion of the task, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and ideological and political work. The meeting required all iron smelting units to quickly establish Party organizations, establish a normal political education system, and carry out red banner competitions, while at the same time caring about the lives of the masses.
    Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that this year's steel production task in Anhui Province has greatly increased compared with last year, and all regions must strengthen leadership, establish a viewpoint of balanced production, overcome slackening thoughts, continue to exert great efforts, and ensure that steel production plans are completed on a monthly basis. Li Renzhi emphasized that saving coal and reducing the coke ratio is the key to completing this year's steel plan, and all units must complete the task of reducing the coke ratio as a political task. The coke ratio in iron smelting is not only a cost issue, but also directly related to the quality of pig iron. All regions should conduct widespread education on saving coal among the masses, and cherish coke as they cherish grain. To ensure the completion of this year's steel production task, we must continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, adopt the methods of great airing, great blooming, big-character posters, and great debates to mobilize the masses to discuss technical problems in production, so as to facilitate the exposure and resolution of contradictions, and implement the policy of relying on the masses to run enterprises well.
    The heads of metallurgical departments from various regions and the Party secretaries, factory directors, workshop directors, and technicians of various iron smelting units who participated in this meeting, after full discussion, put forward a proposal to all iron smelting workers in the province to increase pig iron production, reduce coke ratio, save labor, improve quality, and reduce costs. The representatives of the Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant and the steel plants of various prefectures and cities also launched a heated challenge and response competition during the meeting. Everyone was determined to strive for a greater leap forward on the basis of the victory in 1958 and complete and over fulfill this year's pig iron production task.

    (Reported by this newspaper) After more than two months of rectification, consolidation, and improvement work, Hunan Province's steel production has launched a new campaign. Now, the province's 157 steel production base points not only "match iron smelting needs" and technically transform indigenous blast furnaces to increase output and quality, but also have 185 modern furnaces that have been put into or are about to be put into production; another batch of modern furnaces are undergoing supporting work. The putting into production of these furnaces has greatly advanced the province's steel production on the road of "combining indigenous and modern methods, from indigenous to modern," laying a solid foundation for a greater leap forward throughout the year.
    The new steel production campaign launched in Hunan Province has already seen significant results in January. In January, the province produced more than 37,000 tons of pig iron, an increase of 4.2 times compared with the same period last year; the proportion of foundry pig iron jumped from 16% in the past to 40%; many indigenous blast furnaces can also produce good quality foundry pig iron.
    Due to the province's implementation of steel production baseization, the original production landscape has quickly changed. Xinshao Iron Plant used to be a small iron plant with only two indigenous furnaces and several iron forging furnaces. After last year's great leap forward and the recent rectification, consolidation, and improvement work, it has now become an iron plant with an annual production capacity of 50,000 tons of foundry pig iron. After improving output and quality, some steel production base points have begun to further improve factory management, and have formulated simple systems from production plans, technical operating procedures, and financial management, so as to achieve factory-based management. This has not only promoted production, but also greatly reduced the cost of products. At present, the province's 157 steel production base points are vigorously mobilizing the masses to carry out technical reforms from mining, smelting and other aspects, so as to further improve production.
    In order to make the province's steel production advance by leaps and bounds on the new position, and to launch a high tide of industrial production with steel as the key, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee recently decided to launch a "high-yield and high-quality steel, iron, and coal competition month" in March. Now, the province's steel army is gearing up and actively preparing, striving to show their skills in the province's steel production upsurge.

    让每座小高炉多出铁出好铁
    安徽小高炉炼铁会议倡议竞赛
    湖南省摆开钢铁生产的新阵势
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：安徽省冶金工业厅最近召开小高炉炼铁会议，交流了技术经验，研究了生产中的问题，并向全省炼铁职工发出竞赛倡议，保证今年生铁生产任务的胜利完成。
    去年以来，安徽省全党全民大办钢铁工业，在大建小土高炉的同时，抓住了小洋高炉的建设，到今年1月底止，全省已经建成小洋高炉八百九十一座，其中已投入生产的有四百九十六座，正在施工的还有三百五十座。这些小高炉的总容积共达一万三千多立方公尺。今年1月份共生产生铁七万二千七百五十三吨，占全省1月份总产量的74.3％。已经投入生产的小高炉，生产正在逐步走向正常，技术关在大部地区已被突破，每个炉子的单位产量和生铁质量都比以前有所提高，焦比和成本也在逐步下降。
    会议根据省委的指示，检查了小高炉炼铁中当前存在的主要问题。会议认为：全省小高炉生产和建设虽然取得了很大成绩，但还存在着焦比高、质量不稳定、人员多、成本高、管理制度不健全等问题。针对这些问题，与会人员进行了充分的研究讨论和经验交流，提出了一系列的改进措施，要求在生产上加强管理，实现“三高、一减、二低”，即提高技术、提高产量、提高质量，减少人员，降低焦比，降低成本，达到每座小高炉都能多出铁、出好铁。
    会议认为，加强生产管理是提高产量、提高质量、降低成本的重要因素，要求各炼铁单位建立和加强各种生产制度，和认真贯彻两参、一改、三结合的管理制度。
    为了保证任务的完成，必须加强党的领导和政治思想工作。会议要求各炼铁单位迅速建立起党的组织，建立正常的政治教育制度，开展红旗竞赛，同时必须关心群众生活。
    省委书记处书记李任之同志在会议上讲了话。他指出，今年安徽省钢铁生产任务比去年有了很大增加，各地必须加强领导，树立均衡生产观点，克服松劲思想，继续鼓足干劲，保证钢铁生产计划按月完成。李任之同志强调指出：节约用煤，降低焦比，是完成今年钢铁计划的关键，各单位要把降低焦比当作一个政治任务去完成。省委提出三吨煤炼一吨铁，只要我们制定具体措施，是一定可以实现的。炼铁中焦比的高低，不仅仅是成本问题，也直接关系到生铁的质量，各地应在群众中普遍进行节约用煤的教育，像爱护粮食一样爱护焦炭。要保证今年钢铁生产任务的完成，必须继续大搞群众运动，采用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，发动群众讨论生产上技术上的问题，以利于揭发矛盾和解决矛盾，贯彻依靠群众办好企业的方针。
    参加这次会议的各地冶金部门负责人和各炼铁单位的党委书记、厂长、车间主任、技术员，在经过充分讨论之后，向全省炼铁职工提出了增产生铁、降低焦比、节约劳力、提高质量、降低成本的倡议书。省委钢铁厂和各专、市钢铁厂的与会代表还在会议期间热烈展开挑应战竞赛，大家决心在1958年胜利的基础上争取更大跃进，完成并超额完成今年的生铁生产任务。
    本报讯　经过两个多月的整顿、巩固和提高工作，湖南省的钢铁生产摆开了新的阵势。现在，全省一百五十七个钢铁生产基点不仅做到“炼铁对口”、土高炉进行技术改造，提高了产量和质量，而且已有一百八十五座洋炉投入和即将投入生产；另有一批洋炉正在进行配套工作。这些炉子投入生产，使全省钢铁生产在“土洋结合，由土到洋”的道路上大大前进一步，为全年更大跃进打下了坚实的基础。
    湖南省摆开的钢铁生产新阵势，在1月份已经看到显著效果。1月份全省生产生铁三万七千多吨，比去年同期增加了四点二倍；铸造生铁的比例由过去的16％跃进到40％；许多土高炉也能生产质量良好的铸造生铁。
    由于全省实行钢铁生产基地化，很快改变了原来的生产面貌。新邵铁厂过去是只有两座土炉和几个打铁炉的小铁厂，经过去年的大跃进和不久以前整顿、巩固、提高工作，现在已成为一个有年产铸造生铁五万吨能力的铁厂。部分钢铁生产基点在提高产量和质量以后，已开始进一步改进工厂管理，从生产计划、技术操作规程、财务管理等方面，制订出简便的制度，做到管理工厂化。这样不仅推动了生产，也使产品的成本大大减低。目前，全省一百五十七个钢铁生产基点，正大力发动群众从采矿、冶炼等各个方面大搞技术改革，以便进一步提高生产。
    为了使全省钢铁生产在新的阵地上大踏步前进，在全省掀起一个以钢为纲的工业生产高潮，中共湖南省委最近确定在3月份开展“钢、铁、煤高产高质竞赛月”。现在，全省钢铁大军都摩拳擦掌，积极准备，争取在全省钢铁生产高潮中大显身手。
