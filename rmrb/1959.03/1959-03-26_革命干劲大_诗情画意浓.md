    Stepping into the courtyard of the People's Liberation Army Jinan Region Troops' Poetry and Painting Exhibition, one is immediately greeted by ten golden characters: "Great Revolutionary Drive, Rich Poetic and Artistic Flair." This sentence aptly reflects the spiritual outlook and cultural landscape of the troops. Here, 1,180 art works and 202 poems created by soldiers are exhibited. From these works, one can see the soldiers' firm will, bold character, and loyalty to the motherland. In their poems and paintings, they warmly praised the socialist motherland, the people's communes, and new things both inside and outside the military.

    In an exhibition room, soldier Yin Youyue wrote the following enthusiastic verses about the Party's General Line: "The General Line is a treasure, whoever has it is well-off. Workers with this treasure, production targets are higher than the sky; peasants with this treasure, grain piles reach the clouds; soldiers with this treasure, train day and night without fatigue; everyone with this treasure, socialism will be built early!" Sergeant Liang Linfa vividly depicted the post-commune appearance of his hometown in a painting: on one side, towering blast furnaces illuminate the sky red, on the other side, wheat waves roll, promising a good harvest. Below this watercolor painting is a poem written by another soldier: "The Party is the spring rain, the commune is the flower, one flower blooms in ten thousand homes. Spring rain waters the flowers to bloom beautifully, and the fruits of happiness grow large."

    The heroic images of the soldiers who guard the motherland's coastline day and night also appear in the exhibited poems and paintings. Skilled paper-cutter and Private Jiang Daijiu created a paper-cut: on a stormy night, a sentry stands under the heavy rain, wearing a cloak, with sharp eyes staring straight ahead. Another soldier named Li Dequan wrote a poem that perfectly complements this painting. The poem reads: "The wind blows incessantly, dark clouds cover the stars, lightning flashes across the sky, thunder deafens the ears, heavy rain pours down, waves surge underfoot. I guard the motherland's border, watching every suspicious movement. No matter how cunning the enemy is, they cannot succeed here!" This is a self-portrait of the heroic soldiers. It is these heroic soldiers who guard our motherland's oceans, islands, mountains, and dense forests day and night, ensuring that no matter where they come from, neither aerial bandits nor maritime robbers can escape the destructive blows of the People's Liberation Army soldiers!

    Among the many poems and paintings reflecting the combat training life of the troops, there is a watercolor painting "All-Round Excellence" by Private Zhang Renfu, next to which is a poem titled "Night Battle Training by the Sea" written by Wang Defu. The poem reads: "The moon is tired, the stars are blinking, the waves have calmed, the fishing village has fallen asleep. A team of young Liberation Army soldiers, practice night battles on the beach, quickly cross the hilly terrain, and bravely charge into the sea. The sea smiles, kissing the soldiers' faces. Songs of victory rise, the red sun has risen." These poems and paintings vividly and powerfully cooperate with the central work of the troops.

    Many poems and paintings created by the soldiers have quite rich imaginations and have also better utilized the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Soldier Guo Faming wrote the following poem while smelting iron: "Soldiers smelt iron, burning the sky red, better than Lao Jun refining elixirs. Elixirs cannot guarantee a person's hundred years, but steel can guarantee peace for ten thousand years." Another soldier, Xu Changzhi, who is praised by the masses as a soldier poet, thought that on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, when he was smelting iron with citizens and students, he wondered how many blast furnaces across the country would be smelting iron at the same time, and wouldn't the molten iron flowing out converge into rivers; looking up at the night sky, with a few white clouds supporting a bright moon, he thought that if there really was a Jade Emperor in the sky, wouldn't he mistake this scene for the Milky Way falling into the mortal world. So he wrote: "Sweet osmanthus fragrance for thousands of miles in August, Mid-Autumn Festival molten iron grows into the Yangtze River, the Jade Emperor drives clouds to view the world, suspecting the Milky Way has fallen into the mortal realm."

    This colorful poetry and painting exhibition has aroused widespread attention and praise from local literary and art circles, as well as teachers and students from various universities and colleges. The audience wrote such praises in the guestbook:

    Visited ten miles to find this poetic land,
    Dazzling poems and paintings shine brightly,
    Soldier poets are also painters,
    Civil and military talents are not a vain saying.

    革命干劲大　诗情画意浓
    新华社记者　姜文品
    一踏进人民解放军济南地区部队诗画展览会的大院，迎面就看到“革命干劲大，诗情画意浓”十个金字。这句话恰切地反映了部队的精神面貌和文化面貌。这里，展出了战士创作的一千一百八十幅美术作品和二百零二首诗歌。从这些作品中，可以看出战士们坚韧的意志，豪迈的性格和忠于祖国的情操。他们在诗画中对社会主义祖国、人民公社和军内外新生事物作了热情的歌颂。
    在一间展览室里，战士尹有月对党的总路线写下了这样热情奔放的诗句：“总路线是件宝，谁家有了谁家好。工人有了这件宝，生产指标比天高；农民有了这件宝，粮食堆积通云霄；军人有了这件宝，昼夜练兵不疲劳；人人有了这件宝，社会主义早建好！”上士梁林法把自己家乡公社化后的面貌形象地描述在画面上：一边是高炉耸立，映红天空，一边是麦浪翻滚，丰收在望。在这张水彩画的下面配有另一个战士写的一首诗：“党是春雨社是花，一朵花儿开万家。春雨浇花开的美，幸福果实长的大。”
    日日夜夜守卫在祖国海防线上的战士们的英雄形象，也出现在展出的诗画之中。出色的剪纸能手、下士姜代久，创作了这样一幅剪纸：在狂风暴雨之夜，一个哨兵身披斗篷，矗立在暴雨之下，一双锐利的眼睛，直视前方。另一个名叫李德全的战士写的一首诗，恰好与这幅画搭配起来。诗里写道：“狂风刮个不停，乌云遮住星星，闪电划破长空，雷声震得耳鸣，头上大雨如注，脚下海浪翻腾。我守卫在祖国的边疆，注视着一切可疑的动静，任凭敌人多诡诈，也休想在这里逞能！”这正是英雄战士们的自我写照。正是这些英雄战士们日日夜夜守卫着我们祖国的海洋、岛屿、高山和密林，才使不论是天上的飞贼，或是海上的强盗，不管他们从哪里钻出来，都逃不脱人民解放军战士们的毁灭打击！
    在反映部队战斗训练生活的许多诗画中，有一幅上等兵张仁福画的“全能全优”的水彩画，它的旁边是王德福写的一首题为“海边练夜战”的诗歌。诗里写道：“月亮已疲倦，星星在眨眼，海浪平静了，渔村已入眠。一队青年解放军，海边沙滩练夜战，迅速越过丘陵地，勇猛冲杀入海滩。海水笑开颜，亲吻战士脸。胜利歌声起，红日已出山。”这些诗画，形象而有力地配合了部队的中心工作。
    战士们创作的许多诗画，想象力相当丰富，而且还较好地运用了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法。战士郭发明在炼铁时写了这样一首诗：“战士炼铁烧红天，胜过老君炼仙丹，仙丹难保人百岁，钢铁能保和平万万年。”另一个被群众誉为战士诗人的许长智，去年中秋之夜在同市民、学生一起烧炉炼铁时，他想全国在这一夜不知会有多少高炉在同时炼铁，流出的铁水岂不汇成江河；仰望夜空，几朵白云浮托一轮明月，他想天上如果真有玉皇大帝，见到这种景象岂不误为银河落凡。于是他提笔写道：“八月桂花千里香，中秋铁水成长江，玉皇驾云观世景，疑是银河落凡疆。”
    这个丰富多彩的诗画展览，引起了当地文艺界、各大专院校师生们的普遍重视和赞扬。观众们在留言簿上写下了这样的赞句：
    十里访诗觅此乡，
    琳琅诗画放豪光，
    军人诗人亦画家，
    文武全才不虚讲。
