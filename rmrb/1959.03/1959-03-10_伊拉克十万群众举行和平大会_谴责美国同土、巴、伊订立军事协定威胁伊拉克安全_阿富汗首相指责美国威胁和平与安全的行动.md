Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 8th: Newspapers reported today that a peace congress was held in Mosul, a northern city in Iraq, on the 6th, with the participation of over 100,000 people.

    The congress passed a resolution condemning the bilateral military agreements concluded by the United States with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, considering them a threat to democratic and peace-loving Iraq.

    The congress called for the maintenance of world peace and demanded a ban on the manufacture, testing, and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.

    The congress was held there at the invitation of the Mosul Peace Fighters Committee. Thousands of people poured into this large city in northern Iraq from nearby areas and neighboring provinces.

    Tawfiq Munir, a member of the National Committee of the Iraqi Peace Fighters Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting, in which he spoke about the persecution of the peace movement in Iraq under the old regime. He said that now, the peace fighters of Iraq have stopped all illegal and terrorist acts and liberated their motherland from imperialist enslavement and oppression. He expressed that the peace fighters of Iraq, together with all the peace fighters in the world, are determined to safeguard peace.

    Religious figure Matiouni, in his speech, emphasized the need to oppose imperialism in order to defend peace. Pastor Abu Bibi, in his speech, called for harmonious coexistence between Christians and Muslims, Arabs and Kurds.

    The famous Jordanian politician Shukeir also spoke at the congress, praising the high morale and vitality of the Iraqi people and army.

    The congress supported the resolution passed by the World Peace Council, which called for an end to the Cold War and the settlement of international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Other resolutions of the congress called for the liberation of Arab lands occupied by foreign countries and supported the struggle of the Arab people of Algeria and Oman.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, March 8th: According to the Eastern News Agency, Afghan Prime Minister Daud said that the vague assurances given by the US government regarding the bilateral military agreements signed between the United States and Afghanistan's neighboring countries cannot eliminate the Afghan government's anxiety. "Of course, the Afghan government will have to study more carefully the situation arising from this development."

    He said that, in principle, the Afghan government believes that military treaties are a factor in creating and exacerbating international tensions. He pointed out that despite the unpleasant experience of such treaties and the negative reactions of many countries in the region to these treaties, especially at a time when the entire Middle East is facing various crises, the conclusion of such agreements is still a shortsighted action.

    He also said that the storage of weapons in these countries undermines the balance of power and threatens the peace and security of the entire region.

    阿富汗首相指责美国威胁和平与安全的行动
    新华社巴格达8日电　据报纸今天报道，6日，在伊拉克北部城市摩苏尔举行了有十万多人参加的和平大会。
    大会通过了决议，谴责美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦缔结的双边军事协定，认为这是对民主的和爱好和平的伊拉克的威胁。
    大会呼吁维护世界和平，并且要求禁止制造、试验和储存核武器。
    这次大会是应摩苏尔和平战士委员会的邀请在那里举行的。数以千计的人民从摩苏尔附近的地方和邻近的省份源源不断地来到伊拉克北部的这个大城市。
    伊拉克和平战士委员会全国委员会委员陶菲克·穆尼尔在会上发表了演说，他谈到在旧政权统治下和平运动在伊拉克遭受迫害的情况。他说，现在，伊拉克的和平战士已经制止了一切不法和恐怖行为，并且把他们的祖国从帝国主义的奴役和压迫下解放出来。他表示，伊拉克的和平战士同全世界所有的和平战士一起有决心来维护和平。
    宗教界人士马提乌尼在发言时，强调要反对帝国主义以保卫和平。阿布比牧师在发言中要求基督徒和穆斯林、阿拉伯人和库尔德人之间和好相处。
    著名的约旦政治家舒凯尔也在大会上讲了话，他赞扬伊拉克人民和军队的高昂的士气和生命力。
    大会支持世界和平理事会通过的、要求结束冷战并且通过和平谈判来解决国际争端的决议。大会其他决议要求解放被外国侵占的阿拉伯土地，支持阿尔及利亚和阿曼的阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    新华社喀布尔8日电　据东方通讯社报道，阿富汗首相达乌德说，美国政府就美国和阿富汗邻近国家之间签订的双边军事协定所表示的含糊的保证，并不能够消除阿富汗政府的焦虑，“当然，阿富汗政府将不得不更仔细地研究从这种事态发展中所产生的情况。”
    他说，在原则上，阿富汗政府认为军事条约是制造国际紧张局势并且使其恶化的一个因素。他指出，不顾这种条约并不愉快的经验，以及这个地区的很多国家对这些条约的否定的反应，特别是在整个中东面临各种各样危机的时候，仍然缔结了这种协定，这是一种目光短浅的行动。
    他又说，在这些国家储存武器破坏了力量对比，威胁了整个地区的和平与安全。
