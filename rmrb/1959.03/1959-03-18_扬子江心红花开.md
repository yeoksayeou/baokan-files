Red Flowers Bloom in the Heart of the Yangtze River
Sun Zhen, Jiang Weicai

    A Lively Cabin
    As the east revealed a touch of milky white dawn, we boarded a ship at the Zhenjiang wharf headed for Yangzhong County.

    The ship sailed eastward with the current, and the bustling passengers began to chat with each other. Many were discussing how well the wheat was growing in Yangzhong County this year, and the soaring enthusiasm of the people of Yangzhong County to strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu for three types of wheat (namely barley, wheat, and buckwheat). We also joined the conversation. The vast majority of these passengers were returning to Yangzhong County from Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. Some were family members of workers, returning to their hometown to participate in production; some were employees of the new steel base, who were being transferred to support agricultural production in their hometown due to continuously improving production efficiency; and others were specifically visiting Yangzhong.

    At the suggestion of a passenger, an artist sang in a loud voice:

    The people of Yangzhong are drumming up their energy,
    Managing the wheat fields tightly,
    Striving for a county with 1,000 jin of three wheats per mu,
    Socialism shines brightly.
    …

    "Yangzhong Red"
    Fills the Oasis
    Before we knew it, we arrived at Chuishan Mountain. This is a beautiful mountain standing on the bank of the Yangtze River. The passengers eagerly said, "We're almost at Yangzhong County."

    Someone introduced us: Before liberation, people returning to Yangzhong County from other places would frown and sigh when they saw Chuishan Mountain from afar, saying, "Here comes 'Gruel Mountain' again." Originally, Yangzhong was also a poor place, and because people often drank gruel, people called Chuishan Mountain "Gruel Mountain." But now, people are full of energy when they see Chuishan Mountain, and "Gruel Mountain" has become "Leap Forward Mountain."

    Yangzhong County is in the center of the Yangtze River, a large island in the river, more than seventy li long and ten li wide. Tall river dikes around it keep the mighty river water out. Stepping onto the pier and standing on the river dike, we saw lush green wheat seedlings, one after another, a beautiful oasis.

    In Yangzhong, we visited six people's communes, where the famous "Yangzhong Red" fine wheat variety is planted. Now the stalks are growing thick and strong. In the morning, facing the sun, we looked at the wheat fields. The nearby wheat leaves were covered with bean-sized dewdrops, radiating light; the distant wheat seedlings were like a layer of colored glaze, a shiny dark green.

    Agricultural technician Yang Bingkun was inspecting the ear development of the wheat seedlings in a field where the stems were already elongating. He told us that the ears of wheat could already be seen through a microscope. The largest wheat ears already had seventeen rows of grains, and the largest buckwheat ears already had thirteen rows of grains. Along the river dike, the wheat seedlings were growing neatly and strongly everywhere. As long as we continue to cultivate and manage them, Yangzhong has a good chance of achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu for three wheats.

    Meeting at the Field for Thousand-Jin Wheat
    In the Xinglong People's Commune, we met Zhang Guoyuan, the head of the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee, who jokingly said, "We've brought the Rural Work Department down to the countryside."

    The comrades of the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee personally pulled carts and carried burdens to the Xinglong People's Commune. The first thing they did after arriving was to borrow hoes and rakes to accumulate fertilizer; only after dark did they begin to tidy up their bedding. The next day, the cadres moved into the production teams to participate in production and assist in the work.

    "Go down with a thousand-jin target, come back with a thousand-jin yield." This is the slogan put forward by the Yangzhong County Party Committee to the cadres of all organs. The Yangzhong County Party Committee established three field offices throughout the county. The Secretary of the County Party Committee often held forums with veteran farmers in various field offices to study the growth of the three wheats. Various departments of the county-level organs also moved down to the countryside, with each unit responsible for assisting the work of a people's commune.

    Finely Made Fertilizer Now,
    Better Than Grain in Summer
    We visited the Happiness Commune at the southernmost tip of Yangzhong County, an island within an island in the heart of the Yangtze River.

    At a red flag competition meeting of all members of the Xinsheng Brigade, when the members of the Third Production Team discussed the issue of fertilization, they all said that in the past, the application of smoked soil fertilizer caused some large clods of soil to injure the wheat seedlings. Now that the wheat heads are dense and tender, the smoked soil fertilizer must be made finer. After some deliberation, everyone decided to filter the smoked soil with a sieve to ensure that not a single wheat seedling would be damaged. Based on everyone's discussion, Bao Hengyang, the captain of the Third Production Team, raised his voice and challenged the Second Production Team: "We will sieve the smoked soil finely with a sieve, so as not to hurt a single seedling." As soon as the members of the Second Production Team heard this competition proposal, they immediately responded enthusiastically.

    The two production teams are separated by a small port, with the Second Team to the south of the port and the Third Team to the north. The two production teams set up a fine work battle array on both sides of this "Heart-Piercing Port," fighting across the port. When applying smoked soil fertilizer, the Second Production Team found that some of the soil clods filtered by the sieve were too large and damaged the wheat seedlings. Captain Sun Zhonglin discussed with veteran farmers and technicians and decided to sieve it again with a fine sieve after sieving it with a sieve. After two sievings, the smoked soil fertilizer was as fine as flour.

    Finer and Finer,
    Not a Needle's Width of Error
    This year, Yangzhong County put forward a powerful slogan: "Manage the seedlings like embroidery, not a needle or thread amiss!"

    We passed through the North Street of Xilai Town and entered the "Satellite Gate" of the Tenth Production Team of the Yuexin Brigade of the Happiness Commune. In a field of dark green wheat, there were three women, around fifty years old, sitting on small stools, bending over, weeding in the field. They all held a small shovel with a wooden handle more than a foot long in their hands, using the corner of the small shovel to pick out the weeds one by one in the gaps between the wheat seedlings, like an embroidery girl holding a steel needle. In places where the seedlings were dense, they gently separated the wheat seedlings and pulled out the weeds by hand, as carefully as picking sesame seeds from soybeans.

    "This work is really meticulous!" We couldn't help but praise. An old woman smiled and said to us: "If we want to harvest a thousand jin of wheat per mu, how can we not put in some effort?"

    扬子江心红花开
    孙振　姜韦才
    热闹的船舱
    东方才显出一点乳白色的朝霞，我们就从镇江码头登上了去扬中县的轮船。
    轮船顺流东去，熙熙攘攘的旅客们，相互攀谈起来。很多人在谈论扬中县今年的麦子长得好，谈到了扬中县人民要争取三麦（即大麦、小麦、元麦）亩产千斤的冲天干劲。我们也参加了交谈。这些旅客中绝大多数是从上海、南京等地回到扬中县去的，他们有的是工人家属，这次回到家乡来参加生产；有的是新建钢铁基地上的职工，因为生产效率不断地提高，他们被抽调出来支援家乡的农业生产；还有的人是专门到扬中来参观的。
    在旅客的倡议，一个艺人大声音唱起来：
    扬中人民鼓干劲，
    麦田管理抓得紧，
    要争三麦千斤县，
    社会主义放光明。
    ……。
    “扬中红”
    种满绿洲
    不知不觉到了圌山。这是一座秀丽的大山，矗立在长江边上。旅客们争着说，“快到扬中县了”。
    有人向我们介绍说：解放前从外地回扬中县的人，远远见到圌山，总要锁起眉头叹气说，“又到粯粥山了”。原来扬中也是个贫地方，因为经常喝粯子稀饭，所以人们把圌山称为“粯粥山”。可是，现在人们一见到圌山，精神抖擞，“粯粥山”成了“跃进山”。
    扬中县在长江中心，是江里的一个大岛，长七十多华里，宽十华里。周围高大的江堤，把浩浩的江水挡在外边。登上了码头，站到江堤上，我们看到了绿油油的麦苗，一片连一片，这是一个秀丽的绿洲。
    在扬中，我们访问了六个人民公社，这里种着著名的“扬中红”良种麦，现在苗秆长得粗壮、结实。早晨，我们迎着阳光，向麦田里看去，近处的麦叶上，凝着豆大的露珠，放射着光芒；远处的麦苗，像涂上了一层彩釉，绿得乌亮。
    农业技术员杨炳坤，正在已经拔节的麦田里检查麦苗孕穗的情况。他告诉我们说，透过显微镜，已经可以看到麦穗。最大的小麦穗，已经有了十七排麦粒，最大的元麦穗，已经有十三排麦粒。沿着江堤，处处麦苗都长得整齐茁壮，只要继续加工管理，扬中争取三麦亩产千斤是大有希望的。
    为千斤麦会师田头
    在兴隆人民公社，我们遇见了县委农村工作部长张国源，他开玩笑似地说：“我们提着农村工作部下乡了。”
    县委农村工作部的同志们，亲自拉着板车，挑着担子，来到了兴隆人民公社。他们来到后的第一件事就是借锄头、钉耙，动手积肥；到天黑以后，才开始整理自己的床铺。第二天，干部们就分别住到生产队里，参加生产并协助工作。
    “带着千斤指标下去，带着千斤产量回来”。这是扬中县委对各机关干部提出的口号。扬中县委在全县建立了三个田头办公室。县委书记经常到各个田头办公室召开老农座谈会，研究三麦生长的情况。县级机关各个部门也都搬下了乡，每一个单位负责帮助一个人民公社的工作。
    今比细肥
    夏比粮
    我们访问了扬中县最南端的幸福公社，这是扬子江心的岛中之岛。
    在新升大队一次全体社员红旗竞赛大会上，第三生产队的社员在讨论到施肥问题时，都说过去施熏土肥，有些大泥块压伤了麦苗，现在麦头又密又嫩，熏土肥就要搞得更细。大家一琢磨，决定用漏篮过滤熏土，保证不伤一根麦苗。第三生产队队长鲍恒阳，根据大家的讨论，拉开嗓门向第二生产队挑战：“我们用漏篮把熏土筛细，不伤一根苗。”第二生产队的社员一听到这个竞赛倡议，立即群起应战。
    这两个生产队相隔一道小港，港南是第二队，港北是第三队，两个生产队在这名叫“穿心港”的两岸，摆下了细工细作的阵势，隔港而战。第二生产队在施熏土肥时，发现用漏篮过滤的熏土，有的泥块嫌大，压了麦苗。队长孙忠林就和老农、技术人员研究，决定用漏篮筛过以后，再用漏筛筛一次。经过两次筛滤，熏土肥细得像白面一样。
    一细再细
    一针不差
    今年扬中县提出了一个有力的口号：“管苗如绣花，一针一线都不差！”
    我们穿过西来镇北街，就走进了幸福公社月新大队第十生产队的“卫星门”，在一块乌油油的麦田里，有三个五十上下年岁的妇女，坐着小板橙，弯着腰，在田里薅草。她们手里都拿着一把一尺多长的木柄小锹，在麦苗空档里，用小锹的角口一根一根地把野草挑出来，就像绣花姑娘拿着一支刺锈钢针那样心灵手巧。在苗密的地方，她们便轻轻地理开麦苗，用手拔起野草，功夫细得像在黄豆里拣芝麻。
    “这功夫真细致啊！”我们不禁地称赞起来。一位老太笑咪悠悠地对我们说：“一亩田要收一千斤麦子，不下点功夫怎行？”
