    New Commune Members
    On February 15th, Wang Di, the Secretary of the CPC Keshan County Committee in Heilongjiang Province, along with thirteen others, came from the county seat to the Qianjin Management Area of the Gucheng People's Commune. They were responding to the Party's call for cadres to go down to lower levels and participate in labor training, coming here to be commune members.
        Learning Through Labor
    After they arrived, they immediately threw themselves into the intense spring plowing production, learning labor skills in the process. Manure shoveling seems simple, but it is not so easy to do. Veteran commune members can shovel off a large chunk with one or two scoops, while new commune members who don't know how, only shovel off a small chunk after three or four scoops; after shoveling for a while, they feel weak all over, and their hands are blistered. "Old Teng, you have to give us a lesson." During breaks from work, Comrade Wang Di asked his already acknowledged teacher – veteran commune member Teng Yongxiang – for guidance. The new commune members listened carefully to Old Teng explaining the technique of shoveling manure, watching after listening, and working again after watching. They finally found the trick to shoveling large chunks of manure, and from then on, each of them exceeded the commune's assigned manure shoveling quota every day.
    After putting down their hoes, they learned to drive carts. Although there were many difficulties, and they even encountered some dangers, they did not shrink back. Not only did the male comrades learn to drive carts, but the newly arrived female commune member – Fan Wenxue, the Deputy Secretary of the County Youth League Committee – also learned quickly and drove with gusto. She cracked the whip sharply, "Crack," with a loud sound, "Giddy-up," she shouted, and the livestock obediently pulled the cart to the fields to deliver manure. Some commune members wrote a poem praising her, saying: "The new female commune member drives the cart, inside and out, she shouts with might, everyone praises her for being capable, the girl on the cart laughs heartily."
    Because they were eager to learn, they quickly learned a lot.
        Doing Mass Work
    The new commune members labored alongside the veteran commune members, delving into every aspect of the production process. They quickly discovered some problems in production and promptly reported them to the Party branch and the County Committee work team. After careful joint research, they proposed specific solutions and used practical actions to influence the masses, powerfully promoting spring plowing production.
    During manure accumulation, upon hearing some people reflecting that there was a shortage of manure sources, they consulted with the commune members and proposed more than ten ways to solve the problem of insufficient manure sources, enhancing the masses' confidence in achieving "fields full of manure." Seeing that using hoes to shovel frozen manure was inefficient, they suggested that the Party branch promote high-efficiency tools such as the rapid soil-splitting implement. As a result, the average daily work efficiency per person increased from three cubic meters to six cubic meters. During the upsurge of all-people spring plowing production, after hearing feedback that there were too few people and too much work to do, they learned about the distribution of labor and, together with the County Committee work team, replaced strong laborers from professional positions with those most needed in the production projects, greatly accelerating the progress of manure shoveling and delivery.
            Caring for the Masses' Livelihood
    During their days of living together with the commune members, they used their spare time every day to visit the commune members' homes, humbly listening to their opinions and requests. They always tried their best to solve any problems that could be solved. One night, everyone was busy delivering manure, except for Commune Member Ma Kui's wife, because her father-in-law and husband were sick, and they had gone to the hospital several times during the day, but the doctor had gone to the countryside and could not be reached. As it was getting dark, just when she was worrying about how to get a doctor, the doctor arrived. It turned out that after learning about this situation, the new commune members asked the comrades of the County Committee work team to bring the doctor over. After the doctor examined Ma Kui's father, the old man said, moved, "This time! Even if my illness isn't cured, it'll be eighty percent better!"
    Because these new commune members ate, lived, and labored together with the veteran commune members, they not only learned some labor skills and received training, but also encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses, further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, effectively helped with grassroots work, and promoted spring plowing production.

    新社员
    2月15日，中共黑龙江省克山县委书记王地等十三人由县城来到古城人民公社前进管理区。他们是响应党的干部下放参加劳动锻炼的号召，来这里当社员的。
        在劳动中学习
    他们来到之后，立即投入了紧张的备耕生产，在生产中学习了劳动本领。刨粪，看来很简单，但做起来却不那么容易，老社员刨一两下，就刨下一大块来，而不会刨的新社员，刨三、四下，只刨下一小块；刨一会儿，浑身就没劲了，手也出了泡。“老滕，你得给我们上课了。”在工余的时候，王地同志请教他早已拜好了的老师——老社员滕永祥。新社员们细心地听老滕讲刨粪的技术，听完了又看，看完了再干，他们终于找到了刨下大块粪的窍门，从此平均每人每天都超额完成了社里规定的刨粪定额。
    放下镐把，他们又学赶车。虽然有很多困难，甚至也曾遇到一些惊险，但他们并没有畏缩。不仅男同志学会了赶车，新来的女社员——团县委副书记范文学学得也很快，赶得很带劲。她把大鞭一甩，“卡”的打了个响鞭，“驾”，一声?喝，牲口驯从地拉起大车往地里送粪。有些社员写诗赞扬她说：“新女社员赶起车，里里外外直?喝，人人称赞她能干，姑娘车上笑呵呵。”
    由于他们虚心好学，所以很快就学到了很多东西。
        做群众工作
    新社员们和老社员们在一起劳动，深入各个作业环节，很快地发现了生产中的一些问题，及时汇报给党支部和县委工作组，经过共同细致的研究，提出具体解决的办法，并以实际行动去影响群众，有力地推动了备耕生产。
    在积肥中，听到有人反映粪源不足，他们就和社员共同商量，提出了十多种办法，解决了粪源不足的问题，增强了群众实现“粪满田”的信心。在刨冻土粪中，他们看见用镐刨粪效率太低，就建议党支部推行高工效的快速劈土器等工具，结果，平均每人每天的工效由三立方公尺提高到六立方公尺。在开展全民备耕生产高潮中，他们听到人少活多干不过来的反映以后，就了解劳动力的分布情况，并同县委工作组研究，把专业人员中的强劳动力替换下来投到最需要的生产项目中去，大大加快了刨粪、送粪的进度。
            关心群众生活
    他们在和社员一起生活的日子里，天天利用工余时间到社员家去访问，虚心倾听社员们的意见和要求。凡是能够帮助解决的问题，他们总是想尽办法加以解决。在一天夜里，人人都在忙着送粪，只有社员马魁的爱人没有来，因为她的公公和丈夫生了病，白天到医院去了几次，可是大夫下乡了，没能接来。天黑了，当她正发愁没法接大夫的时候，大夫却来了。原来是新社员了解到这个情况后，就请县委工作组的同志把大夫给接来了。当大夫给马魁的父亲看过病以后，这位老人感动地说：“这回呀！我这病不治也能好八分哪！”
    由于这些新社员和老社员同吃同住同劳动，不仅学会了一些劳动技术，受到了锻炼，而且也鼓舞了群众的干劲，进一步地密切了干部与群众的关系，有效地帮助了基层工作，推动了备耕生产。
