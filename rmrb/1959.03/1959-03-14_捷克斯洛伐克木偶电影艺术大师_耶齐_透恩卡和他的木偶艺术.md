    Do you still remember the puppet image of "The Good Soldier Švejk"? The Czechoslovak Puppet Film Art Exhibition is currently being held in Beijing. This exhibition features many excellent works by Jiří Trnka, the author of "The Good Soldier Švejk."

    Czechoslovakia's puppet art achievements enjoy great international prestige. Jiří Trnka is a master of puppet film art in the Czechoslovak Republic. His puppets possess a unique charm and are widely welcomed by children and adults alike.

    From an early age, Trnka possessed artistic talent and worked in a famous puppet troupe. Here, he learned the techniques of puppetry. After graduating from a craft school, he engaged in several artistic endeavors simultaneously. He drew inexhaustible artistic inspiration from Czechoslovakia's long tradition of puppet theater. Coupled with his own rich imagination and simple yet expressive talent for portraying characters and creating dramatic effects, his art gradually reached a mature state. Before engaging in puppet film art, he was an experienced and excellent painter, constantly creating illustrations for children's books and drawing many satirical cartoons. At the same time, he was a satirical short story writer. He also served as an art director for animated film studios.

    His first puppet film, "The Czech Year," has won many international awards. In this film, he used various folk songs, dances, and rural customs as themes to vividly depict typical Czechoslovak farmers and the bustling atmosphere of the countryside. Following this successful work, he successively created dozens of puppet films such as "The Emperor's Nightingale," "Song of the Prairie," "Prince Bayaya," "The Good Soldier Švejk," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Old Czech Legends." Trnka achieved great success in various expressive techniques.

      "Old Czech Legends" is Trnka's first film to give puppets a voice. A large-scale crowd scene is arranged in this film. This time, he collaborated with playwrights to solve many creative problems together.

      "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is his recent wide-screen color puppet film adapted from Shakespeare's comedy. He arranged many beautiful fairies, elves, goblins, animated acorns and pine cones, and dancing tree roots in the film, thus making this realm with the charming Titania, the tyrannical Oberon, and mischievous goblins a fascinating and magical world. This is difficult to achieve under the limitations of stage and lighting. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is performed in pantomime and dance. It is more convincing than dialogue and more poetic than using narration.

    Trnka's creations have rich and broad themes. In all his works, he strives to make his artistic style suitable for the theme of the film. This puppet art master does not stop at his existing achievements, but pursues a new art form and style in each film, constantly making his puppets more and more perfect. His actors – the puppets – are all beautiful and full of expression and personality. This is not only due to his artistic achievements, but more importantly, he gives deep human emotions to his puppets. His creation is not naturalistically letting puppets imitate living people, but expressing their personalities through the puppets' specific faces and movements. In particular, he is good at using the flexible expressions of the puppets' eyes to create dramatic effects and express various human thoughts and feelings. Some people praised him and said: "From the point of view of performance, Trnka's puppets surpassed real actors in the most touching scenes." This is not an exaggeration.

    Chinese audiences who love puppet art, you can not only carefully appreciate Trnka's works at the exhibition, but also see the brilliant achievements of Czechoslovak puppet film art. (With pictures)

    捷克斯洛伐克木偶电影艺术大师
    耶齐·透恩卡和他的木偶艺术
    你们还记得“好兵帅克”的木偶形象吗？现在捷克斯洛伐克木偶电影艺术展览会正在北京举行。这个展览会上展出了“好兵帅克”作者耶齐·透恩卡的许多优秀作品。
    捷克斯洛伐克的木偶艺术的成就，在国际上享有极大的声誉。耶齐·透恩卡是捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国的木偶电影艺术大师。他的木偶具有独特的魅力，受到了儿童和成年人普遍的欢迎。
    透恩卡从小就有艺术天才，在一个著名的木偶剧团里工作。在这儿他学会了木偶戏的技术。当他从工艺学校毕业后就同时从事了好几种艺术工作。他从捷克斯洛伐克悠久的木偶戏艺术的传统中汲取了用之不竭的艺术源泉。加上他自己的丰富的想像力和朴素而又善于表现人物性格、以及戏剧效果的才能，使他的艺术逐渐达到成熟的境界。在他从事木偶电影艺术以前，他是一位有丰富经验的优秀画家，一直为儿童读物作插画，也画过不少讽刺画。同时，他又是讽刺短文作家。他也担任过动画电影制片厂的艺术指导。
    他的第一部木偶影片“捷克的一年”在国际上曾多次获奖。在这部影片里，他采用了各种民歌、舞蹈和农村风俗习惯作为主题，生动地描绘了典型的捷克斯洛伐克农民和农村中的喧闹气氛。继这部成功之作以后，他陆续地创作了“皇帝的夜莺”、“草原之歌”、“巴耶耶王子”、“好兵帅克”、“仲夏夜之梦”和“捷克古代传说”等几十部木偶片。透恩卡在各种表现手法上都获得了很高的成就。
      “捷克古代传说”是透恩卡第一部使木偶有声的影片。在这部片子里安排了一个大规模的群众场面。这一次，他使木偶艺术工作者同戏剧家合作，共同解决了许多创作上的问题。
      “仲夏夜之梦”是他新近根据莎士比亚喜剧改编摄制的宽银幕彩色木偶片。他在影片中安排了许多美丽的仙女、小精灵、小妖精，活了的橡子和松毯，跳起舞来的树根，这样就使这个有着迷人的蒂旦尼亚仙后，暴虐的奥白龙和恶作剧的小妖精的国度成为一个富于魅力和神奇的世界。这在舞台和灯光的限制之下是难于办到的。“仲夏夜之梦”以哑剧和舞蹈形式演出。它比起对话方式来更有说服力，比起用解说方法更有诗意。
    透恩卡的创作有丰富而广阔的题材。在他所有的作品中都力求他的艺术风格适合于影片的主题。这位木偶艺术大师，没有停留在已有的成就上，他在每一部片子中都在追求一个新的艺术形式和风格，不断地使他的木偶益趋完美。他的演员们——木偶都美丽而富于表情和个性。这不仅是由于他的艺术成就，更重要的是他把人类的深厚感情赋予了他的木偶。他的创作不是自然主义地让木偶模仿活人，而是通过木偶特定的脸谱和身段，来表现它们的个性。特别是善于运用木偶眼睛的灵活表情来产生戏剧效果，表达各种不同的人的思想感情。有人称赞地说：“从表演的观点看来，透恩卡的木偶在最动人的场面中超过了真演员。”这是并不过分的。
    爱好木偶艺术的中国观众们，你们在展览会上不仅可以细细地欣赏透恩卡的作品，而且可以看到捷克斯洛伐克木偶电影艺术的光辉成就。（附图片）
