After the establishment of the Uyan People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang, the commune regularly conducted socialist and communist ideological education for its members through night Party schools, night Youth League schools, and Red and Expert schools. Furthermore, on the basis of “three-izations” (industrialization, mechanization, and electrification), it implemented democratic management and established a “cadre-masses dual participation” system where cadres participate in production and commune members participate in management. This greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members and powerfully promoted the flying leap development of industrial and agricultural production. Although the area of winter planting last year was doubled compared to previous years, and the male labor force decreased by 40% compared to 1957, the task was completed fifteen days earlier than in previous years, and measures such as deep plowing, strip sowing, and close planting were implemented. There was also great development in industry and sideline occupations, with the establishment of 190 livestock farms, raising more than 11,000 pigs and more than 1,200 sheep. In just over two months, the income reached 380,000 yuan. On the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the income of commune members increased greatly. After the wages were distributed, everyone beamed with joy, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher.

Two Contradictions, Two Roads

After the establishment of the Uyan People's Commune, although there was a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the political consciousness of the commune members was greatly improved, there were still some problems in the work. At that time, there were two prominent contradictions: First, after the rectification campaign, cadres' awareness had been raised, their work style had been transformed, and they wanted to participate in production, lead production, go deep among the masses, and follow the mass line. However, after communization, the situation changed, the scope was wide (industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs), and the tasks were heavy (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries). Cadres spent more time in the office and in meetings, and less time going deep among the masses and participating in production. Everyone urgently wanted to find a way to change their work style. Second, after communization, the masses of commune members implemented the three-izations, and had the rudiments of an agricultural production army. Under the education of the Party's General Line, they liberated their minds, and on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, they enthusiastically demanded that commune cadres better and faster lead production and life. They urgently demanded a change in the phenomenon of the leadership style temporarily lagging behind the situation.

Under such circumstances, two roads were placed before the commune Party committee: one was to increase the number of cadres; the other was to strengthen the Party's leadership and implement democratic management. At first, the commune Party committee took the former road, increasing the number of commune cadres from more than 120 to more than 340. The result was that the number of upper-level cadres increased, the number of people detached from production increased, affairs became more chaotic, and the practice of taking everything into one's own hands became more serious. Experience proved that this road was impassable.

Later, the commune cadres gradually realized that the key was to improve the cadres' work style. The Party committee was determined to implement the mass line and implement the method of cadres participating in labor and the masses participating in management.

Three Processes, Gradual Improvement

The participation of cadres in production and the participation of the masses in management did not develop and improve all at once, but rather went through a process. In summary, there are three processes. The first process was budding experimentation: First, in the Liyang Production Team and the Rixi Production Team, commune members took turns being on duty. At the beginning, they only called people to work, but later it was expanded to assist the operation group leader in allocating the labor force for the day and checking and accepting the quality of agricultural work. The effect was very good. At that time, the conditions for duty officers were: Except for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they were commune members with higher political consciousness, certain production experience, a little ability to handle affairs, and prestige among the masses. This form and effect greatly enlightened the Party committee, and the Party committee was determined to summarize and promote it.

The second process: universal promotion, letting a hundred flowers bloom. Under the leadership of the Party committee, a field meeting of 40 production teams in the three brigades of the entire commune was held to learn from the experience of the Rixi Team. Various production teams adopted various methods in promotion, and a situation of letting a hundred flowers bloom appeared. Some established duty officers in the operation group, some established duty officers in the production team, and some established duty officers in both the production team and the operation group. Some of the members of the duty officer included all commune members, and some participated after being evaluated by the masses according to certain conditions. In terms of the scope of management, some were purely in charge of production, and some were in charge of both production and life. In terms of time, some were one-day systems, some were three-day systems, some were five-day systems, some were both male and female duty officers, and some had only one duty officer per day. At the same time, the Party committee sent a portion of the commune cadres, brigade cadres, and even a few production team cadres to work at the grassroots level for half a month. These different practices all achieved different degrees of effect, but also brought many new contradictions:

First of all, after some commune members participated in team and group management, contradictions appeared between "team leader, group leader, and duty officer." The methods for solving this contradiction were also different. Most teams did "seize major powers, disperse minor powers"; some teams (such as the 52nd Team) duty officers only performed the three tasks of "knocking the gong, carrying water, and cooking," and the team leader was still busy with affairs, and the work was very chaotic. Commune members reflected: "The duty officer has become a errand boy, a cook." Some teams (such as the Shuangxitang Team) simply implemented the method of the team leader stepping down and not managing the work, and did not know anything about the team's situation, losing their leadership role. The second contradiction was: "There is a contradiction between the previous shift duty officer and the next shift duty officer. The next shift duty officer does not understand the production of the previous shift, and cannot find the duty officer. Some duty officers even reflect that: "The previous one does not hand over, the next one does not take over. The old monk does not explain the affairs of the temple clearly, and the new monk does not even know how many bodhisattvas there are." In order to solve this contradiction, the commune Party committee went deep into the Shangxi and Zhoujiaqiao Production Teams, and after discussing with the masses, researched and established a "handover" system. The third contradiction was that duty officers with different working abilities produced two different effects on production. In teams with weak duty officers, some wealthy peasants proposed "Don't let these people be duty officers." The commune Party committee analyzed the characteristics of the agricultural front, where most were young people, women, and semi-laborers. Most of them were poor and lower-middle peasants, with high enthusiasm and great energy, but lacking working ability and production experience. As long as they were trained, they would be able to manage production. Through the masses' great airing of views, a method of "two leading one helping" was adopted. Two leads were: old hands lead new hands, strong abilities lead weak abilities; one help was: the team leader helps the duty officer to specifically arrange and solve difficulties. Through this method, many duty officers with poor abilities went from being unfamiliar once to being proficient twice, and became experts three times, becoming cadres with strong abilities.

The third process is summarizing and improving. The commune Party committee made a preliminary summary of the problems and experiences and lessons learned in the promotion process, promoting the good and eliminating the bad. It affirmed the "two leading one helping" and "handover" systems, eliminated the method of the branch secretary and production team leader stepping down and not managing the work, and stipulated the scope of the team leader's powers: ① Regularly summarize the work, formulate short-term plans in a timely manner according to the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and study measures to complete the plans. ② Assist the duty officer in formulating five-day or seven-day plans, and check the implementation of the plans and the quality of agricultural work. ③ Devote most of the time to participating in labor, going deep among the masses, discovering problems, and solving them in a timely manner. ④ Handle major daily affairs within the team, such as production distribution, major life issues, and approve leave of absence for no more than one day. ⑤ Do a good job in political and ideological work according to the requirements of the Party branch. The scope of powers of the operation group leader was also set at five, which were roughly the same as those of the production team leader. Clear regulations were made on the scope of the duty officer's powers: ① Under the leadership of the team leader and group leader, arrange the agricultural work of the team and group according to the needs of the short-term plan, and allocate the labor force. ② Check and accept the quality of agricultural work. ③ Handle daily administrative affairs, such as calling for work, calling for meetings, implementing work and rest times, and approving half-day leave. ④ Under the leadership of the team and group leader, commend and criticize the production situation of the commune members on that day. ⑤ Conscientiously implement the handover system. The commune also stipulated the conditions for duty officers with reference to the experience of advanced teams. The commune promoted the duty officer system of the production team to all fronts, and "duty officer" systems were established on the industrial, logistics, sideline occupation, and financial fronts.

"Cadre-Masses Dual Participation" Shines Brightly

The practice of one month has proved that the "dual participation" system is full of life. It effectively improves the leadership style, enabling commune cadres to go deep among the masses, integrate with the masses, participate in production, and lead production, truly appearing as ordinary laborers, correctly solving the contradiction between leadership and being led, and promoting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and masses, greatly changing people's interrelationships, and making industrial and agricultural production leap forward together. The specific advantages are as follows:

(1) Cadres can participate in labor, go deep among the masses, understand the situation below, integrate with the masses, and better publicize the Party's policies. On the other hand, they can grasp the plans and measures of the commune, team, and group, and the key issues in implementation, and better allocate labor, formulate quotas, and implement the responsibility system of layered contracting. Cadres said: "Combining the Party's policies with the enthusiasm of the masses can overcome any difficulties." Cadres personally experience participating in production, can better appreciate the hardships of the masses, care about the production and life of the masses, enhance the concept of the masses, and truly follow the mass line. Through the "duty officer" system, the cadres' bureaucratism is greatly reduced, and the time spent going deep among the masses and participating in labor is greatly increased. Sixty-four commune cadres have already participated in labor in batches. The labor volume of other cadres has generally increased compared to the past, and overall it has increased by more than 50%. Because they are free from bureaucratism, cadres spend more time studying, and the Red and Expert School has already trained two batches, a total of 286 people, all of whom are cadres above the level of small team leader, and the cadres' awareness has been greatly improved.

(2) After the implementation of the "dual participation" system, the sense of responsibility of the masses has been greatly strengthened, their enthusiasm has been greatly improved, and the sense of ownership has been further established. More than 13,000 laborers in the entire commune participated in duty, and they understand production, manage production, are lively and cheerful, and feel comfortable. The experience of the duty officer is: "Participating in production and participating in management can better understand production, understand cadres, better listen to cadres, cadres and mass relations are closer, the collective concept is more enhanced, and the democratic centralism is better reflected." In the past, the masses generally participated in management indirectly. Now, after turning to directly participating in a part of management, they have a deeper understanding of cadres and the collective, and their enthusiasm is even higher.

(3) Through the "dual participation" system, a large number of red and expert cadres and activists are cultivated, becoming a source for promoting cadres and developing Party and League members. A large number of cadres and activists are tempered every day in their own practical struggle positions, constantly summarizing and comparing, plus batch rotation training, and the cultivation of night Party schools and red and expert night schools, and gradually become both red and expert cadres. After a large number of cadres and activists were transferred to support industry, the commune Party committee has now trained 211 cadres, including 2 brigade leaders, 2 women directors, 7 brigade accountants, more than 90 production team leaders, and more than 110 operation group leaders. Fifty-two Party members and more than 80 League members have been developed. There are currently more than 60 development targets, and 20 Party members are currently being prepared for development, greatly enriching the leadership of the grass-roots core and ensuring the role of the Party's fighting fortress.

(4) The relationship between the Party and the masses is closer, and the Party's policies can be better implemented among the masses of commune members. After the cadres participated in labor and production, they quickly discovered problems: For example, the Shuangxitang Production Team only focused on agriculture. Although its output was the highest in the entire brigade, its income was not high, and it was the most indebted team in the entire brigade. Many commune members lacked pocket money, and there was dissatisfaction in their minds, and they were not active in production. On the contrary, the Dongxi Production Team, although located in mountainous areas with barren land, had greatly increased its income due to the development of diversified operations. The income from silkworm raising alone was more than 2,000 yuan, and all the debts owed in the past were paid off. At the same time, it was also found that although the Liyang Production Team extracted 55% of its labor force to engage in diversified operations, the agricultural production tasks were completed ahead of schedule due to the good arrangement of the labor force and the formation of various professional teams. After discovering these situations, the commune Party committee analyzed and studied them, and put forward opinions on comprehensively arranging various tasks, correctly solving the problems in production.

(5) The more far-reaching significance of the "cadre-masses dual participation" system lies in the fact that with the gradual development of national industrialization, commune industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification, the new system of cadres participating in production and the masses participating in management will help to gradually eliminate the difference between mental labor and physical labor.

    干部参加生产，社员参加管理
    中共乌岩公社党委书记　　王天仁
    浙江黄岩县乌岩人民公社在建立起来后，通过夜党校、夜团校、红专学校等，经常不断地向社员进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育，并且在“三化”的基础上，实行了管理民主化，建立了干部参加生产、社员参加管理的
  “干群双参”制度，因而大大地激发了社员的劳动热情，有力地推动了工农业生产的飞跃发展。虽然去年冬种的面积比往年增加了一倍，男劳动力又比1957年减少40％，却比往年提早十五天完成了任务，并实行了深耕、条播、密植等措施。在工业和副业方面，也有很大发展并建立了一百九十个畜牧场，养猪一万一千多头，羊一千二百多头，仅二个多月的时间，收入达三十八万元。在工农业生产大跃进的基础上，社员收入大大增加，发放工资后，个个眉开眼笑，劳动热情更加高涨。
    两个矛盾、两条道路
    乌岩人民公社建立以后，虽然工农业生产有了很大的跃进，社员的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，但是工作中也还存在一些问题。当时突出的矛盾有两个：一是干部在整风以后，觉悟提高，作风转变，要求参加生产、领导生产，深入群众，走群众路线；但是公社化以后，形势变化了，范围广（工农商学兵），任务重（农林牧副渔），干部忙于办公和开会的时间多了，深入群众和参加生产的时间少了。大家迫切要求找到转变工作作风的办法。二是社员群众在公社化以后，实行了三化，有了农业生产军的雏形，在党的总路线的教育下，解放了思想，和在1958年大跃进的基础上，热烈要求公社干部更好地、更快地领导好生产和生活。对出现的领导作风暂时落后于形势的现象，迫切要求改变。
    在这种情况下，摆在公社党委面前两条路：一条是增加干部；一条是加强党的领导，贯彻执行民主管理。公社党委起初采取了前一条路，把公社干部由一百二十多人增加至三百四十多人，结果是上层干部增多，脱离生产人员加大，事务更加忙乱，包办代替更加严重。经验证明，此路不通。
    后来公社干部渐渐认识到关键是改进干部的作风。党委下决心，贯彻执行群众路线，实行干部参加劳动、群众参加管理的办法。
    三个过程，逐步完善
    干部参加生产、群众参加管理不是一下子发展完善的，是有一个过程的。概括起来有三个过程。第一个过程是萌芽试验：首先里洋生产队和日溪生产队由社员轮流值日，开始时只叫人出工，后来扩大到协助操作组长调配当天的劳动力，检查验收农活质量，效果很好。当时值星员条件是：除地、富、反、坏、右分子以外，政治觉悟较高，有一定生产经验，稍有办事能力，群众中有威信的社员担任。这种形式和效果，给党委很大启发，党委决心总结推广。
    第二个过程：普遍推广，百花齐放。在党委的领导下，召开全社三个大队四十个生产队的现场会议，学习日溪队的经验。各生产队在推广时，采用了多种多样的办法，出现了百花齐放的局面。有的以操作组为单位建立值星员，有的以生产队为单位建立值星员，有的生产队、操作组都建立值星员。值星员的成员，有的是所有社员都参加，有的按照条件，经过群众评定再参加。管理范围上有的单纯管生产，有的既管生产，又管生活。在时间上，有的一日制，有的三日制，也有的五日制，有的男女双值星，有的一天只一个值星员。与此同时，党委把一部分公社干部、大队干部、甚至少数生产队干部下放劳动，时间半月。这些不同的作法，都收到程度不同的效果，同时也出现了许多新矛盾：
    首先是部分社员参加队、组管理后，出现了“队长、组长和值星员”之间的矛盾。当初解决这个矛盾的办法也不尽相同，大多数队做到“大权独揽，小权分散”；有的队（如五?队）值星员只执行“敲锣、挑水、烧饭”三个任务，队长仍忙于事务，工作很乱。社员反映：“值星员变成跑腿员，变成伙夫员”。有的队（如双溪塘队）干脆实行队长下放，不管工作的办法，对于队里情况，一问三不知，失去了领导作用。其次一个矛盾是：“上一班值星员与下一班值星员之间有矛盾。下一班值星员对上一班生产不了解，找值星员找不到，甚至有的值星员反映说：“上不交，下不接，老和尚不把寺内事情讲清，新和尚连几尊菩萨也不知道”。为了解决这个矛盾，公社党委深入上溪、周家桥生产队，经和群众商量后，研究建立了“交接班”制度。第三个矛盾是，工作能力强弱不同的值星员，生产上出现两种不同的效果，在弱的值星员队里，有的富裕农民提出“不要这些人来当值星员”。公社党委分析农业战线上大部分是青年多，妇女多，半劳动力多的特点，他们大部分是贫农、下中农，热情高，干劲大，但缺乏工作能力和生产经验，只要培养锻炼，是能够管理生产的。通过群众大放大鸣，采取了“两带一帮”的办法。两带是：老手带新手，能力强的带能力弱的；一帮是：队长帮值星员具体安排，解决困难。通过这个办法，使许多能力差的值星员一次生疏、二次熟练，三次成了内行，成了能力强的干部。
    第三个过程是总结提高。公社党委把推广过程出现的问题和经验教训进行了初步总结，好的发扬，坏的去掉。肯定“两带一帮”和“交接班”制度，去掉了分支书记、生产小队长下放不管工作的办法，规定了队长的职权范围：①定期总结工作，根据上级布置的任务，及时制定小段计划，研究完成计划的措施。②辅助值星员制订五天或七天计划，检查计划贯彻执行情况和农活质量。③抽出绝大部分时间参加劳动，深入群众，发现问题，及时解决。④处理队内日常重大事务，如生产分配、生活重大问题，批准一天以内的请假等。⑤根据党支部要求，做好政治思想工作。操作组长的职权范围也定了五条，和生产队长的大同小异。对值星员的职权范围作了明确规定：①在队长、组长领导下，根据小段计划的需要，安排本队、本组农活，调配劳动力。②检查验收农活质量。③处理日常行政事务，如叫出工、叫开会，执行作息时间，批准半天请假。④在队组长领导下，表扬批评当天的社员生产状况。⑤认真执行交接班制度。对值星员条件参照先进队的经验也做了规定。公社把生产队的值星员制度在各条战线上推广开来，工业、后勤、副业财务等战线都建立了“值星员”制度。
    “干群双参”，大放光芒
    从一个月的实践中证明，“双参”制度是富有生命的，它有效地改进了领导作风，使公社干部既能深入群众，和群众打成一片，又能参加生产，领导生产，真正以普通劳动者的姿态出现，正确解决了领导与被领导的矛盾，发扬了广大干部群众的积极性，使人们的相互关系起了很大变化，使工农业生产双飞齐跃。具体优越性有了以下几方面：
      （一）干部一方面能参加劳动，深入群众，了解下情，和群众打成一片，更好地宣传党的方针、政策；另方面又能掌握住社、队、组的计划、措施，和执行中的关键问题，更好地调配劳力、制定定额和执行分层包干的责任制。干部说：“党的方针、政策和群众的积极性结合起来，什么困难都克服得了”。干部亲身体验参加生产，更能体会群众疾苦，关心群众生产、生活，增强群众观念，真正做到走群众路线。通过“值星员”制度，干部的事务主义、官僚主义大大减少，深入群众，参加劳动的时间大大增加。公社干部已有六十四人，分期分批参加劳动。其他干部的劳动量普遍比过去增加，总起来约增多50％以上。因为摆脱了事务主义，干部参加学习时间多了，红专学校已轮训二批，共二百八十六人，都是小队长以上干部，干部觉悟大大提高。
      （二）群众在“双参”制度实行以后，责任心大大加强，积极性大大提高，进一步树立了主人翁思想。全社一万三千多个劳力，参加值星的有七千二百多人，他们了解生产、管理生产，生动活泼，心情舒畅。值星员的体会是
  “参加生产、参加管理，更能了解生产，体贴干部；更能听干部话，干群关系更加密切，集体观念更加增强，更好地体现民主集中制。”过去群众一般是间接参加管理的，现在转到直接参加一部分管理后，对干部和集体体会得更加深刻，他们的积极性也更加高涨。
      （三）通过“双参”制度，培养大批的红专干部和积极分子，成为提拔干部和发展党员、团员的源泉。大批的干部和积极分子，在自己实践斗争的岗位上，天天锻炼，不断总结评比，再加上分批轮训，夜党校、红专夜校的培养，逐步就变成又红又专的干部。在大批的干部和积极分子外调支援工业以后，现在公社党委已培养了干部二百一十一人，计大队长二人，妇女主任二人，大队会计七人，生产队长九十多人，操作组长一百十多人；已发展党员五十二人，团员八十多人，现有发展对象六十多人，最近又正在准备发展党员二十人，大大地充实了基层核心的领导，保证党的战斗堡垒作用。
      （四）党群关系更加密切，党的方针、政策能更好地在社员群众中贯彻执行。干部参加劳动生产后，很快就发现了问题：如双溪塘生产队由于光搞农业，虽然产量是全大队最高的一个队，但收入不多，是全大队负债最多的队。有不少社员由于缺乏零用钱，思想上存在不满情绪，生产不积极。相反，东溪生产队，虽然地处山区，土地瘠薄，但由于发展多种经营，收入增加很大，光养蚕收入就有二千多元，过去所欠的债全部还清。同时，还发现里洋生产队虽然抽出55％的劳动力去搞多种经营，但由于劳动力安排得好，组成了各种专业队，农业生产任务也提前完成。公社党委发现这些情况后，经过分析研究，提出了全面安排各项工作的意见，正确地解决生产中的问题。
      （五）“干群双参”制的更深远的意义，在于随着国家工业化，公社工业化，农业机械化、电气化的逐步发展，通过干部参加生产、群众参加管理的新制度，有利于逐步消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别。
