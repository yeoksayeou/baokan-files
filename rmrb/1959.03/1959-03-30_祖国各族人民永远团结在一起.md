To the Editorial Comrades:

When we heard the news that the majority of Kālons and reactionary upper-class elements of the Tibetan local government had colluded with bandits to stage a rebellion and harm the people, we were filled with boundless indignation! This act of betraying the motherland and undermining unity betrayed the highest interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all nationalities throughout the country. We resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government, and we also resolutely support the actions of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to thoroughly quell the rebellion.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely following the path of socialism and communism is the highest aspiration of the people of all nationalities in our country. At present, the vast majority of regions inhabited by all nationalities in the country have implemented social democratic reforms and socialist transformation, and most regions established people's communes last year. The people of all nationalities are vigorously and confidently engaged in socialist construction. Due to the limitations of historical development conditions, the Tibetan region is still stuck in a feudal serf society, and the vast number of working people are living a life worse than that of beasts of burden under the oppression of heavy feudal shackles. They deeply yearn for the early arrival of a free, equal, happy, and fulfilling socialist society. However, the reactionary elements representing the interests of feudal lords vainly attempt to maintain their corrupt and dark rule forever, attempting to prevent the Tibetan people from embarking on the road to a happy and fulfilling socialist life. Their conspiracy to violate the interests of the people has met with a shameful failure.

The people of all nationalities throughout the country deeply hope that the Tibetan people will be liberated from the darkest feudal serf system in the world as soon as possible, so that the vast number of Tibetan people can join the people of all nationalities throughout the country in building a prosperous and strong socialist motherland.

Safeguarding the unification of the motherland and strengthening the unity among all nationalities are the highest interests of the people of all nationalities throughout the country. Any words or actions that split the motherland and undermine national unity violate the fundamental interests of all nationalities. Only in the united and unified family of the motherland can the people of all nationalities build their own happy and fulfilling new life. Therefore, we must resolutely fight to the end against all crimes that split the motherland and undermine national unity!

    祖国各族人民永远团结在一起编辑同志：
    当我们听到西藏地方政府多数噶伦和上层反动集团纠集叛匪、进行叛乱、残害人民的消息后，心中无比愤怒！这种背叛祖国、破坏统一的行为背叛了西藏人民和全国各族人民的最高利益。我们坚决拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府的命令，同时我们也坚决拥护与支持中国人民解放军驻西藏部队彻底平息叛乱的行动。
    在中国共产党的领导下，坚决地走社会主义和共产主义道路是我国各族人民的最高愿望。现在全国各族绝大部分地区都实行了社会民主改革和社会主义改造，大部分地区在去年又都建立了人民公社，各族人民正精神奋发、信心百倍地进行着社会主义建设。由于历史发展条件的限制，西藏地区现在还停留在封建农奴制社会，广大劳苦人民在重重封建枷锁的压榨下过着牛马不如的生活。他们深切地向往着自由、平等、幸福、美满的社会主义社会的早日到来。但是，代表封建领主利益的反动分子们却妄想永远保持他们腐朽黑暗的统治，企图阻止西藏人民走幸福美满的社会主义道路。他们这种违背人民利益的阴谋已遭到可耻的失败。
    全国各族人民都深切盼望着西藏人民早日从世界上最黑暗的封建农奴制度下解放出来，使西藏广大人民同全国各族人民一道建设繁荣富强的社会主义祖国。
    维护祖国的统一、加强各族人民间的团结是全国各族人民的最高利益。任何分裂祖国、破坏民族团结的言论行动都是违背着各族人民的根本利益。各族人民只有在团结统一的祖国大家庭里才能建设自己幸福美满的新生活。因此我们必须同一切分裂祖国、破坏民族团结的罪行坚决斗争到底！
