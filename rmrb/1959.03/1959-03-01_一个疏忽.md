    A Slip-up
    On February 21st, a contradictory situation occurred in the group of pictures and an article about the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain on the sixth and eighth pages of the People's Daily: The pictures reported on the current life situation of Comrade Song Xueyi, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain who survived back then, and the caption pointed out that two heroes escaped at the time. However, the article on the eighth page stated: "The Five Heroes of Langya Mountain have been gone from the people for eighteen years. But the heroic spirit of the five heroes will forever live in the hearts of the broad masses of people..." This statement is inconsistent with the facts and is a slip-up that should not have occurred in the newspaper.

    一个疏忽
    2月21日人民日报第六版和第八版关于狼牙山五壮士的一组图片和一篇文章里，发生了这样的矛盾事情：图片中报道了当年生还的狼牙山五壮士之一的宋学义同志现在的生活情形，而且在说明中还指出当时有两位壮士脱险。但是第八版的文章中却说：“狼牙山五壮士离开人们十八年了。可是五壮士的英勇精神却永远活在广大人民心里……”。这种说法是不符合事实的，是报纸上不应有的疏忽。
