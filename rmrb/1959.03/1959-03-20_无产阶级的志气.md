The Ambition of the Proletariat
Wang Quan

Many people know that there is a Wang Guofan Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province. When the production cooperative was established in 1952, the entire cooperative had twenty-three poor peasant households, and their combined shares of donkeys amounted to only three donkey legs. All twenty-three cooperative members were very poor and had no money to invest in the cooperative to buy other means of production. People called them the "Poor Bastards' Cooperative." However, this "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" was poor in material possessions but not in ambition. They did not want to rely on state loans, nor did they want to depend on the help of other cooperatives. They used their own hands, relying entirely on their own hard work, and worked diligently under difficult conditions. After three years, the cooperative was greatly consolidated and developed, and they purchased a large number of means of production. Chairman Mao said, "This is the image of our entire country."

More than a month ago, I took a trip to this original "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" and saw this moving image. As the people there said, "In the past, there were only three donkey legs, but now tractors are running everywhere." Now, every time I think of their tractors rumbling, I can't help but be moved. Moreover, even electric lights have been installed in the village. In three to five years, the "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" became a historical term.

What kind of force is it that has realized this moving image before our eyes? The people in the cooperative said, "This is all because of the leadership of the Communist Party." This is entirely correct. With correct leadership, one must also work hard to achieve success. It is precisely like this: a group of "poor bastards" who do not want to rely on anything, but only rely on the leadership of the Communist Party and the labor of their own hands, walking step by step along a correct path, and no matter how great the difficulties are, they cannot shake their glorious and brilliant ideals. In the people's common language, these are all ambitious people. In the cause of building socialism, we have many, many such ambitious people. When they are still in difficulty, they use the labor of their own hands to overcome their difficulties. They do not easily rely on the help of others, because they know that solving their own difficulties so easily will increase the difficulties of the entire socialist cause. For the victory of the entire socialist construction cause, they need to take on their own difficulties and let everyone advance faster, better, and more comprehensively on the road of building socialism. What these people possess is not any other ambition, but a firm and unyielding ambition of the proletariat.

For decades, our Party has led the people of the whole country and defeated one powerful enemy after another in extremely difficult circumstances, relying on nothing else but this kind of proletarian ambition. Just recalling it will bring many earth-shattering scenes to our eyes! In the situation of white terror, we had nothing in our hands, but because we believed that our cause would surely be victorious, we never wavered in our revolutionary ambition, no matter how difficult the circumstances were. During the revolutionary war period, we fought fierce battles with powerful enemies on the one hand, and solved the problem of our own clothing and food by the labor of our own hands on the other hand. Sometimes, in extremely difficult circumstances, we could not eat enough and could not wear enough clothes, but we finally defeated the fierce enemy. After the victory of the revolution, our Party again led the people of the whole country to carry out large-scale production and construction, and many difficult situations appeared before us in various, more complex, and unfamiliar forms. However, it is because there are so many ambitious people like the twenty-three poor peasant households of that "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" that we have overcome one difficulty after another. This is the reason why the image of that "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" is so exciting and moving. Without this kind of ambition, our cause of building socialism would not have today's victory.

Today, our whole country is united as one, building a socialist society on a poor and blank land. The Party's general line shines like a beacon, illuminating our future. Our proletarian ambition has been transformed into soaring enthusiasm. Yes, we are poor and blank, but we have such ambition to change the face of our motherland with our own hands. Isn't the image of that "Poor Bastards' Cooperative" in Zunhua County our example? For example, after the people's communes were established, the economic development of some communes was faster and some were slower. The production teams under the leadership of the communes, because the economic foundations before the communization were different, some were richer and some were poorer. Communes with slower economic development need to catch up with communes with faster development, and production teams with relatively poor economic foundations need to catch up with better production teams. Rely on what? Rely on the leadership of the Communist Party, rely on the labor of our own hands, and rely on steadfast revolutionary ambition. In this way, after another effort, we 600 million original "poor bastards" will turn the entire country into the most affluent paradise.

    无产阶级的志气
    王全
    许多人都知道河北遵化县有个王国藩合作社，1952年建立生产合作社的时候，全社二十三户贫农，按驴股合起来只有三条驴腿，二十三户社员都很穷，也没有钱向社投资来买其他生产资料。人们把他们叫“穷棒子社”。可是这个“穷棒子社”人穷志不穷，他们一不想依靠国家贷款，二不想依赖其他合作社的帮助。他们用他们的双手，完全依靠自己的刻苦的劳动，在艰苦的条件下埋头苦干，经过三年的时间，就使合作社获得了大大的巩固和发展，购置了大批的生产资料。毛主席说“这就是我们整个国家的形象。”
    一个多月以前，我到这个原来的“穷棒子社”去跑了一趟，看到了这个动人的形象。正如那里的人们说的，“过去驴腿只三条，如今拖拉机到处跑。”现在每次想起他们的拖拉机在轰隆隆地响着，总不能不受到感动。而且现在村里连电灯都安上了。三、五年工夫，“穷棒子社”成了历史名词。
    究竟是什么力量，在我们的眼前实现了这个动人的形象？社里的人们说：“这都是因为有了共产党的领导。”这是完全正确的。有了正确的领导，还得要自己大干特干才能取得成就。正是这样：一伙“穷棒子”，什么也不想依靠，只依靠共产党的领导和自己的双手的劳动，沿着一条正确的道路一步步往前走，无论多大的困难也动摇不了他们的光辉灿烂的理想。用人民的通俗的语言来说，这都是一些有志气的人。在建设社会主义的事业上，我们有着许许多多这样有志气的人。当他们还有困难的时候，他们就用自己双手的劳动来克服自己的困难。他们没有轻易地依赖别人的帮助，因为他们知道，这样轻易地解决自己的困难，就会增加整个社会主义事业的困难，而为了整个社会主义建设事业的胜利，正需要他们把自己的困难担当起来，让大伙一起在建设社会主义的道路上更快、更好、更全面地不断前进。这样一些人所具有的，不是什么别的志气，这正是一种坚贞不移的无产阶级的志气。
    数十年来，我们党领导着全国人民，曾经在极其困难的情况下，打败了一个又一个强大的敌人，不是靠别的，就靠这种无产阶级的志气。只要回想一下，在我们的眼前就会出现多少惊天动地的景象！在白色恐怖的情况下，我们的手上一无所有，只是因为我们相信我们的事业一定要胜利，无论在多么艰难的情况下，也没有动摇过我们革命的志气。在革命战争时期，我们一面和强大的敌人进行着激烈的战斗，一面靠自己双手的劳动解决自己穿衣吃饭的问题，有时候在极其困难的情况下，饭吃不饱，衣也穿不上，但是我们终于还是打败了凶恶的敌人。革命胜利以后，我们党又领导着全国人民，进行规模宏大的生产建设，许多困难的情况，以多种多样的、更加复杂的、而且是我们所不熟悉的形式出现在我们面前。但是，就是因为有了像那个“穷棒子社”的二十三户贫农那样许许多多有志气的人，使我们战胜了一个又一个的困难。那个“穷棒子社”的形象之所以令人兴奋，令人感动，就是这个原因。如果没有这种志气，我们的建设社会主义的事业就不会有今天这样的胜利。
    如今，我们全国上下一心，正在一穷二白的土地上建设社会主义社会。党的总路线像指路明灯一样照耀着我们的前途。我们的无产阶级的志气已经化为冲天的干劲。是的，我们一穷二白，但是我们有这样的志气，用我们的双手来改变祖国的面貌。遵化县的那个“穷棒子社”的形象，不是我们的榜样么？譬如说，人民公社化以后，各个公社的经济发展有的快些有的慢些，在公社领导下的生产队，因为在公社化以前的经济基础不一样，有的富些，有的差些。经济发展得慢些的公社需要赶上发展得快些的公社，原来经济基础比较差的生产队需要赶上比较好的生产队。靠什么呢？靠共产党的领导，靠自己双手的劳动，靠坚贞不移的革命的志气。这样，再经过一番努力，我们六万万原来的“穷棒子”就要把整个国家变成一座最富足的乐园。
