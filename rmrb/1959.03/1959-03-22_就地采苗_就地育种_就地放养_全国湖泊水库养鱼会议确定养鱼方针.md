Xinhua News Agency, March 21st. The National Conference on Lake and Reservoir Fish Farming, recently convened, pointed out that utilizing newly built reservoirs in mountainous areas and lakes in various regions for large-scale fish farming will rapidly develop the national freshwater aquaculture industry. In 1958, the area of lakes and reservoirs used for fish farming nationwide increased from 6.2 million mu in the previous year to over 20 million mu, but this still only accounts for a quarter of the total water surface area suitable for fish farming in all lakes and reservoirs, so the prospects for the development of freshwater fish farming are still very great.

Reservoir fish farming is a new undertaking that has developed in recent years along with the development of water conservancy construction in rural areas. It has enabled many mountainous areas and rural areas in the north to raise fish for the first time. Lake fish farming was relatively common in the south in the past, but it has also greatly developed in the Great Leap Forward last year. Last year, many fishery cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives around large lakes such as Honghu Lake in Hubei Province and Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province, under the call of the Party and the government, changed the practice of simple fishing and began to engage in storage and breeding, which greatly increased fish production.

The meeting believed that there are many advantages to developing fish farming using lakes and reservoirs. First, lakes and reservoirs have a wide water surface, the water quality is relatively fertile, and the oxygen content is high, which is conducive to the activity and growth of fish; second, fish production on large water surfaces is concentrated, which has a certain effect on producing commercial fish to supply the market; at the same time, the labor productivity of lake and reservoir fish farming is high, and generally each person can produce 10,000 to 20,000 jin per year. The meeting pointed out that according to last year's experience, when developing lake and reservoir fish farming, it is necessary to analyze the specific conditions of the water surface, and separately determine the utilization method, and the steps should be taken from small to large, from easy to difficult, and from rough to refined. Lake and reservoir fish farming must do a good job in preventing escape, eliminating pests, and fishing. The meeting exchanged some experiences in this regard. Regarding the issue of what kind of fish to raise, the meeting required all regions to implement the policy of "obtaining seedlings locally, breeding locally, and raising locally," expand the variety of fish farmed, and change the situation of simply emphasizing the four major domestic fish: grass carp, black carp, silver carp, and bighead carp. Regarding the feed issue, the meeting believed that green feed and green manure should be the main sources of feed, and all regions should open up feed sources in many ways according to local conditions.

### 就地采苗  就地育种  就地放养  全国湖泊水库养鱼会议确定养鱼方针

    就地采苗  就地育种  就地放养
    全国湖泊水库养鱼会议确定养鱼方针
    新华社21日讯　在最近召开的全国湖泊水库养鱼会议指出：利用山区新修的水库和各地的湖泊大量养鱼，将使全国淡水养殖事业飞快发展。1958年全国湖泊、水库养鱼面积已由前年的六百二十万亩增加到二千多万亩，但还只占全部湖泊和水库可养总水面的四分之一，所以淡水养鱼的发展前途还很大。
    水库养鱼是近年来随着农村兴修水利发展起来的新兴事业，它使北方许多山区和农村也破天荒地养了鱼。湖泊养鱼过去在南方比较普遍，但去年大跃进中又有了很大发展。去年，湖北省洪湖、安徽省巢湖等大型湖泊周围许多渔业社和农业社在党和政府的号召下，改变了单纯捕捞的作法，开始进行蓄养，使鱼产量大增。
    会议认为：利用湖泊水库发展养鱼有很多优点。首先，湖泊、水库受水面广，水质较肥，含氧率高，有利鱼类的活动和成长；其次，大水面渔产集中，对生产商品鱼供应市场有一定的作用；同时，湖泊、水库养鱼劳动生产率高，一般的每年每人可生产一万斤到二万斤。会议指出：根据去年的经验，发展湖泊、水库养鱼时，要分析水面具体条件，分别决定利用办法，应采取先小后大、先易后难、由粗到精的步骤。湖泊水库养鱼要做好防逃、除敌害、捞捕等工作。会议在这方面交流了一些经验。对于养什么鱼的问题，会议要求各地贯彻“就地采苗、就地育种、就地放养”的方针，扩大养鱼的品种，改变单纯强调青、草、鲢、鳙四大家鱼的情况。关于饲料问题，会议认为应以青饲绿肥为主，各地要因地制宜地多方面开辟饲料来源。
