Xinhua News Agency Report: Jute producing communes in Zhejiang province are making preparations early for jute planting, striving to produce more jute this year to support industrial construction. The province plans to increase the jute planting area by 20% compared to last year, and double the total jute output.

The jute-producing counties and people's communes in Zhejiang Province have formulated advanced plans for this year's jute production, proposed concrete measures, and launched mutual competition between counties and communes. Xiaoshan County, which accounts for about half of the province's jute output, is striving to achieve an average yield of 1,700 to 2,000 jin per mu for more than 200,000 mu of jute this year, and has proposed a competition with Haining County. The Jiubao Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou City, whose jute production achieved a bumper harvest last year, is also launching competitions among its management areas and production teams, and is vigorously accumulating fertilizer and preparing improved seeds for the jute fields. At present, the jute seeds prepared in various jute-producing areas can meet the requirements of planting about 40,000 plants per mu this year. In addition to sowing according to dense planting requirements and preparing reserve seeds for replanting, Xiaoshan, Haining and other counties have surplus seeds to support other areas. This year, the jute-producing areas also plan to expand the planting area of the high-yielding, high-quality "long-pod variety" from 50% last year to 80%. Therefore, many communes are adjusting and exchanging "long-pod variety" seeds.

In order to start sowing early and strive to basically complete sowing before "立夏" [lixia - Beginning of Summer], the communes in various jute-producing areas are currently stepping up technical training and tool preparation. Xiaoshan County has trained more than 1,600 technical backbones for jute planting, and each operating group in each commune in the county has trained technicians. The communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou City are also preparing to train more than 10,000 jute planting technicians in early March. In addition, many jute-producing communes are also carrying out tool reforms according to the requirements of dense planting and wide ridges. Xiaoshan County's communes have converted nearly 1,000 double-row seeders into four-row seeders.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Hubei Province, which ranks first in the country in ramie production, will vigorously develop ramie production this year while grasping grain, cotton, and oil production. The province's ramie area this year will be doubled compared to last year, and preparations are now underway in various places to strive for a bumper ramie harvest this year. More than 100,000 jin of ramie seeds are being transferred to various places. In order to solve the planting technology problems in the new ramie areas, various places are vigorously training ramie planting technicians. Huangpi County, which is expanding the ramie area by 50,000 mu this year, has trained more than 150 ramie planting technicians in the county's agricultural technology training class.

The relevant departments of Hubei Province believe that this year's ramie production can tap potential from the following aspects: First, grasp large-area balanced production increase, so that the large-area hemp fields can catch up with the high-yield hemp fields. Second, grasp the balance of three seasons, change the phenomenon that the first crop of ramie has high yield, and the second and third crops have low yield in the past, and further strengthen the management of the second and third crops, and increase fertilizer application. Third, grasp the high yield of new ramie fields, sow early, transplant early, and strengthen the management of new ramie fields.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest in the new ramie fields in the same year, various places are preparing to sow between "惊蛰" [Jingzhe - Awakening of Insects] and "春分" [Chunfen - Vernal Equinox], one solar term earlier than in previous years. At present, many new ramie areas are preparing seedbeds for sowing. Most of the old ramie fields have also been deep-plowed, cultivated, fertilized, and dewormed. Many old ramie areas are also supplementing sparse hemp fields.

    浙江黄麻产区提前准备播种工作
    湖北大力发展苎麻生产
    据新华社讯　浙江省黄麻产区的各人民公社，正在提前准备黄麻播种工作，争取今年生产出更多的黄麻支援工业建设。今年全省计划种植的黄麻面积要比去年增加两成，黄麻总产量要比去年翻一番。
    浙江省各产麻县和人民公社已订出今年黄麻生产的跃进规划，提出具体措施，开展县与县、社与社之间的相互竞赛。黄麻产量占全省约一半的萧山县，争取今年全县二十多万亩黄麻平均亩产一千七百斤到两千斤，并向海宁县提出开展竞赛。去年黄麻生产得到大丰收的杭州市郊九堡公社各管理区、生产队，也相互展开竞赛，并且正在大闹麻地积肥和准备良种。现在，各麻区准备的黄麻种子已能满足今年每亩密植四万株左右的要求，萧山、海宁等县除了按密植要求播种和准备补种的预备种子以外，还有多余种子支援外地。各产麻区今年还计划将产量高、质量好的“长果种”的播种面积由去年的50％扩大到80％，因此许多公社正在调剂和调换“长果种”。
    各产麻区公社为了提早播种，并争取在“立夏”前基本播完，目前正在加紧进行技术训练和工具准备等工作。萧山县已经训练了一千六百多名植麻技术骨干，全县各公社每个操作组都有经过训练的技术员，杭州市郊各公社也准备在3月上旬训练一万多个植麻技术员。此外，许多产麻区人民公社还根据密植、阔畦的要求，进行工具改革。萧山县各公社已将近一千架双行条播器改为四行条播器。
    据新华社讯　苎麻产量占全国第一位的湖北省，今年在抓紧粮、棉、油生产的同时，将大力发展苎麻生产。这个省今年苎麻的面积将比去年扩大一倍，现在各地正在为争取今年苎麻丰收作好一切准备工作。十万多斤苎麻种籽正源源调往各地。为了解决新麻区的植麻技术问题，各地正在大力训练植麻技术员。今年扩大苎麻面积五万亩的黄陂县，在县农业技术训练班里培训了一百五十多名植麻技术员。
    湖北省有关部门认为，今年的苎麻生产可以从以下几个方面挖潜力：一、抓大面积平衡增产，使大面积的麻田都向丰产麻田看齐。二、抓三季平衡，改变过去头麻产量高，二麻、三麻产量低的现象，进一步加强二麻、三麻的管理，增施肥料。三、抓新麻田丰产，提早播种，提早移栽，加强新麻田的管理。
    为了争取新麻田当年丰收，各地都准备在“惊蛰”到“春分”期间播种，较往年提早一个节令。现在，许多新麻区正在整理苗床，作播种准备。大部分老麻田也做好了深耕、培土、施肥、除虫等工作。许多老麻区还给一些蔸稀的麻田进行补蔸。
