Work Hard and Cleverly to Produce More Steel
Yuan Zhen, Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    This year is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle, and a year in which the whole country, with steel as the key link, will organize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward to seize 18 million tons of steel. In this glorious year, our Anshan Iron and Steel Company is undertaking the even more glorious and arduous tasks assigned by the Party and the state. This year, we will also have a significant increase in the six indicators of steel, iron, steel products, coke, iron ore, and refractory bricks compared to the actual output in 1958. In addition, in line with these six major products, there will be significant increases in transportation, machinery processing, and power supply.
    From the beginning of this year, all the staff and workers of our Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been engaged in the intense battle to seize 18 million tons of steel for the whole country. We have extensively launched red banner competitions. Especially since February, all the staff and workers have been in higher spirits and have more enthusiasm. They are doing everything possible to overcome all difficulties and working hard, practically, cleverly, and meticulously to improve the daily production level. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the average daily output of iron and steel has been increasing month by month, and the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces has been increasing month by month. By the end of February, the production level had increased significantly.
    While boosting our energy, we must also firmly grasp measures, especially a series of measures related to improving the production level of iron and steel, such as capital construction projects and major and medium repairs. To this end, we must implement the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," and, based on the order of priority and urgency, make unified arrangements to use limited human, material, and financial resources in the most urgently needed areas. We must ensure that the newly built large coke ovens, simple coke ovens, beneficiation, sintering machines, water wells, gas, ingot cranes, boilers and other projects are put into production on schedule, and the major and medium repairs of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces are completed on time. Important measures projects in ironmaking, steelmaking, mining, sintering, chemical, refractory, transportation, power and other aspects should be realized as scheduled.
    At the same time, we must resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," and do a good job in training out-of-town personnel. We must also ensure that we complete the task of transferring personnel according to the national plan.
    In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of our annual iron and steel leap forward plan, we warmly respond to the call of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry: to carry out friendly competitions among various fraternal units. To this end, we propose the following competition conditions:
    1. Ensure the completion of the production plan for steel, iron, and steel products on a daily, ten-day, monthly, and quarterly basis.
    2. Ensure that the average utilization coefficient of the hearth bottom of large open-hearth furnaces reaches 9.45 throughout the year, with a qualified ingot rate of 98.6%; the average utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces reaches 1.7, with a qualified pig iron rate of 98%; and ensure that the average utilization coefficient of the hearth bottom of large open-hearth furnaces reaches 9.74 in the second quarter, and the average utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces reaches 1.62.
    The average annual first-class product rate (qualified rate for the No.1 primary rolling mill) of each major steel rolling mill—No. 1 primary rolling, large, seamless, medium, No. 2 medium plate, No. 2 thin plate, No. 1 small, and No. 2 small—reaches 98%, 80%, 95%, 96%, 94%, 80.06%, 97.36%, and 96.6% respectively; the quality meets the national standards; and the annual operating rate reaches 84%, 78%, 85.4%, 80%, 74.2%, 85%, 86.1%, and 86.3% respectively.
    3. Practice strict economy and reduce consumption quotas. The average consumption of iron and steel materials per ton of steel in large open-hearth furnaces throughout the year is 1007 kg, the average coke consumption per ton of iron in large blast furnaces is 670 kg, and the average steel yield reaches 74%.

    苦干巧干多出钢铁
    鞍山钢铁公司经理　袁振
    今年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，是全国以钢为纲为夺取一千八百万吨钢而组织更大更好更全面跃进的一年。在这样光辉的一年里，我们鞍山钢铁公司担负着党和国家所赋予的更加光荣而艰巨的任务。我们今年在钢、铁、钢材、焦炭、铁矿石、耐火砖六项指标方面，较1958年的实际产量亦有很大增长。此外，与这六项主要产品相适应，运输、机械加工、动力供应等方面均有很大的增长。
    我们鞍钢全体职工，从今年一开始，就投入了为夺取全国一千八百万吨钢的紧张战斗。广泛开展红旗竞赛，特别是2月份以来，全体职工情绪更饱满，干劲更足，千方百计地克服一切困难，为提高日产水平而苦干、实干、巧干、细干，因而，今年以来，钢铁平均日产量逐月上升，平炉和高炉利用系数逐月提高，到2月下旬生产水平更有显著的增长。
    在鼓足干劲的同时，我们还必须狠狠抓措施，紧紧抓措施，特别是围绕着提高铁、钢生产水平有关的基建工程和大、中修等一系列的措施。为此，必须贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，本着轻重缓急统一排队，把有限的人力、物力、财力用到最急需的地方去，务使新建的大型焦炉、简易焦炉、选矿、烧结机、水井、煤气、铸锭吊车、锅炉等工程按期投入生产，大、中修的高炉、平炉按时竣工，炼铁、炼钢、矿山、烧结、化工、耐火、运输、动力等方面的重要措施项目如期实现。
    同时，我们还必须坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，作好外来人员的培训工作；还要保证按照国家计划，完成外调人员的任务。
    为了保证完成和超额完成我们全年的钢铁跃进计划。我们热烈地响应冶金部的号召：开展各兄弟单位之间的友谊竞赛。为此，提出以下竞赛条件：
    一、并保证按日、按旬、按月、按季完成钢、铁、钢材的生产计划。
    二、保证全年大型平炉炉底利用系数平均达到九点四五，钢锭合格率为98.6％：大型高炉利用系数平均达到一点七，生铁合格率为98％；并保证在二季度大型平炉炉底利用系数平均达到九点七四，大型高炉平均利用系数平均达到一点六二。
    各个主要轧钢厂——一初轧、大型、无缝、中型、二中板、二薄板、一小型、二小型的全年一级品率（一初轧厂为合格率）平均分别达到98％，80％，95％，96％，94％，80.06％，97.36％，96.6％；质量达到国家规定的指标；全年作业率分别达到84％，78％，85.4％，80％，74.2％，85％，86.1％，86.3％。
    三、厉行节约，降低消耗定额。全年大型平炉平均每吨钢的钢铁料消耗量为一千零七公斤，大型高炉平均每吨铁消耗焦炭六百七十公斤，钢材收得率平均达到74％。
