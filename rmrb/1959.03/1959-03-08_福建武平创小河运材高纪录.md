Fujian Wuping Sets High Record for Small River Timber Transport

    (Reported) The entire staff of the Shuili (Water Transport) Team of the Xiaba Forestry Station in Wuping County, Fujian Province, overcame the difficulties of low water and created a new high record for timber transportation on small rivers.

    The Wuping Xiaba Water Transport Team is responsible for supporting timber transportation to Guangdong and other provinces, and frequently operates on a small river between Wuping and Jiaoling, Guangdong. This small river can only navigate wooden sailing boats. Due to the shallow water, each string of timber could only carry a volume of just over ten cubic meters, with a maximum of no more than twenty cubic meters. Since the second half of last year, all employees have broken superstitions and established a style of daring to think and act. They have broken quotas more than ten times, increasing the timber load per string from the original twenty cubic meters to more than four hundred cubic meters. Recently, in order to accelerate timber flow and timely support the timber needs of Guangdong and other provinces, they proposed that the loading volume should exceed the 1,000 cubic meter mark. Team leaders and workers studied together and finally created the "centipede-style double-layer raft" loading method, lengthening the raft. Timber with high buoyancy was placed at the bottom of the raft, forming a giant timber raft of 1,776 meters (297 sections) long, with a volume of 1,172.24 cubic meters, which was transported by twenty-five workers to Jiaoling, Guangdong.

    福建武平创小河运材高纪录
    本报讯　福建省武平县下坝林业站水运队全体职工战胜枯水困难，创造小河运材最高纪录。
    武平下坝水运队担负支援广东等省木材运输工作，经常活跃在武平和广东蕉岭一带的一条小河上。这条小河只能航驶木帆船，由于水浅，一连木材装排量只十多立方公尺，最高也不过二十立方公尺，从去年下半年以来，全体职工破除了迷信，树立了敢想敢作的风格，曾先后十多次突破定额，木材装排量由原来二十立方公尺，提高到四百多立方公尺。最近，他们为了加速木材流送，及时支援广东等省用材需要，提出装排量要跨过千立方公尺大关。队领导和工人一起研究，终于创造了“蜈蚣式双层排”装排法，拉长排身，排底放上浮力大的木材，装成了一连长达一千七百七十六公尺（二百九十七节）的巨型木排，材积达一千一百七十二点二四立方公尺，由二十五个工人捎运抵达广东蕉岭。
