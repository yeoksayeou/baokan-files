The "New York Times" openly admits that Laos is undermining the Geneva Accords, with the United States as the mastermind behind it
    This newspaper report March 9th "New York Times" published an editorial, once again confessing that the United States is the instigator of the Lao authorities' illegal acts of tearing up the Geneva Accords and the mad destroyer of peace in Indochina.
    This newspaper, which has always reflected the official attitude of the United States, admitted in its editorial that because Laos tore up the Geneva Accords, the United States has obtained a better opportunity to accelerate its intervention in Laos, especially military intervention. Referring to the large amount of military equipment received by the Lao authorities from the United States, it openly declared: "Now, we can train 25,000 Lao troops, and Laos is also free to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." The editorial also brazenly advocated that Laos' illegal act of undermining the Geneva Accords "is also our struggle, and therefore worthy of our help."
    Prior to the publication of this editorial, the "New York Times" had admitted in its recent editorials and articles that Laos' act of undermining the Geneva Accords was taken with the support of the United States. "New York Times" reporter Dargan wrote in the February 13th newspaper that Laos' refusal to fulfill the Geneva Accords "clears the way" for the Pentagon, because the Pentagon hopes to control the Lao army and establish US military bases in Laos. Dargan also pointed out that strengthening military cooperation between Laos and the United States will enable Laos to establish a closer relationship with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    In addition, the "New York Times" also admitted in its February 23rd editorial that "Laos has received timely support from the United States, and its attitude has finally become firm." This editorial proudly praised the Lao government's act of undermining the Geneva Accords as "taking a clever path."

### “纽约时报”公开供认  老挝破坏日内瓦协议  美国是背后的策动者

    “纽约时报”公开供认
    老挝破坏日内瓦协议  美国是背后的策动者
    本报讯　3月9日“纽约时报”发表的社论，再一次招供了美国是老挝当局撕毁日内瓦协议的非法行为的主使者和印度支那和平的疯狂破坏者。
    这家一向反映美国官方态度的报纸的社论承认，由于老挝撕毁了日内瓦协议，美国已经获得更好的机会来加速它对老挝的干涉，特别是军事干涉活动。它在提到老挝当局收到的美国的大量军事装备时公开宣称：“现在，我们可以训练老挝二万五千名陆军，而老挝也可以自由参加东南亚条约组织”。社论还公然鼓吹老挝破坏日内瓦协议的非法行为“也是我们的斗争，因而值得我们予以帮助”。
    在这篇社论发表之前，“纽约时报”曾经在它近来连续发表过的社论和文章中承认了老挝破坏日内瓦协议的行为是在美国支持下采取的。“纽约时报”记者达尔根在2月13日的报纸上写道，老挝拒绝履行日内瓦协议为五角大楼“扫清道路”，因为五角大楼希望控制老挝军队并在老挝建立美国的军事基地。达尔根还指出，加强老挝同美国的军事合作将使老挝同东南亚条约组织建立更紧密的关系。
    此外，“纽约时报”在2月23日的社论中还承认，“老挝得到美国的及时支持，它最后态度坚定起来了”。这篇社论得意地夸奖老挝政府这种破坏日内瓦协议的行为是“正在走着一条聪明的道路”。
