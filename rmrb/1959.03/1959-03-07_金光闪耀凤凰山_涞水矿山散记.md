Golden Light Shining on Phoenix Mountain
——Sketches from Laishui Mine
Wang Jinfeng

  In the morning, I treaded the rugged mountain road and came to Phoenix Mountain in Laishui. The mountains were still shrouded in misty fog, but the valleys echoed with bursts of earth-shattering cannon fire.

  The thousands of miners fighting in this deep mountain valley began another day of new battles.

	Mining Wells Blossom, Waves Surge

  The "Vanguard Company" is the most active team on the construction site. Everyone wears a faded military uniform, and people know at a glance that they have a different background. It turns out that they defended peace in Korea and withstood the test of arduous battles. Today, coming to the mine, they still inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition and serve as pioneers in the mine's great technical revolution.

  The commune members from the countryside only knew how to drill small holes and set off small explosions, but the blasting effect was not significant, and they couldn't solve the problem. However, those who came from the battlefield, combining the experience of digging tunnels on the Korean battlefield, finally overcame the difficulties and created various forms of multiple explosions such as "chain explosions" and "leap forward explosions." At once, they could blast out twenty-four tons, increasing the blasting effect eightfold.

  When the sound of opening the mountain reverberated through the mountains like thunder, people saw waves of ore rising all over the mountain and felt unspeakable joy in their hearts.

	Ore Travels on Steep Cliffs

  The rapid increase in ore production placed new burdens on transportation.

  Relying solely on donkeys, manual carrying, and back-packing on the narrow and rugged mountain roads could not meet the needs. It was necessary to find new shortcuts. "Can we find a fast and good road for the ore?"

  Technicians got up before dawn every day, ran up the mountain to observe and measure, but several experiments according to the original plan failed.

  Later, after the workers' painstaking research and visits to other places, the first drawing of a locally-made cableway transportation system was created.

  Afterward, they spent countless nights and finally used local methods to build the first 375-meter-long aerial transportation line in the mountains. The success of this aerial transportation line allowed one person to operate and transport 100 tons of ore per day, increasing work efficiency by 13.3 times, making ore transportation an extremely easy task.

  When the workers saw the ore-filled wooden buckets swiftly flying down from the top of the mountain, they couldn't help but clap their hands and cheer. They said, "Once the mind is liberated, the ore can travel on steep cliffs!"

		A Young Miner
  In the evening, the closing horn sounded on the mountain, the clear and crisp horn sound summoning the workers who had labored all day to rest.

  At this time, young worker Zhai Shufang carried his pickaxe and walked down from the mountain humming a ditty... He was full of optimism and a strong love for the mine. Asked why he was so happy, he pointed to the mountain ridge in the west reflecting the golden sunset glow and said, "Iron ore has recently been discovered on that big mountain. If the mining area expands this year and achieves semi-mechanization, I must learn to operate a pneumatic drill!" The brilliance flashing in his bright eyes told people that he had infinite love and beautiful aspirations for life.

  Ordinary builders who are fighting hard to realize a better tomorrow, the heroes emerging from the motherland, your drive will be admired by people forever, just like the golden mountains.

    金光闪耀凤凰山
    ——涞水矿山散记
    王金锋
  早晨，我踏着崎岖的山路来到涞水凤凰山。群山还弥漫着蒙蒙的雾气，峡谷里便回荡起阵阵震天的炮响。
    战斗在这深山峡谷里的几千名采矿工人又一天的新的战斗开始了。
      矿井开花翻巨浪
    “尖兵连”是工地上最活跃的一支队伍。每个人都穿一身褪了色的军装，人们一看便知道他们另有一番来历。原来，他们在朝鲜保卫过和平，经受过艰苦的战斗的考验，今天，来到矿山，仍然继承着光荣的革命传统，在全矿大搞技术革命的浪潮里充当着先锋。
    来自农村的社员，只知道打小眼放响炮，可是，爆破效力不大，却无法解决。然而，那些从战场上下来的人，结合在朝鲜战场打坑道的经验，终于克服了困难，创造出“连环炮”“跃进炮”等各种不同的群炮形式。一下子就可以轰出二十四吨，爆破效力提高了八倍。
    当开山的炮声像劈天的雷鸣，震撼着群山的时候，人们看到满山矿石翻起了巨浪，心里都有说不尽的喜悦。
      矿石行在峭壁悬崖
    矿石的产量迅速的增长，给运输加重了新的任务。
    在狭窄崎岖的山路上，光靠毛驴驮运，人工抬、背，是不能满足需要的。必须想各种办法寻找新的捷径。“能不能给矿石找出一条又快又好的道路来？”
    技术员们，每天不等天亮就爬起来，跑上山去，观察、测量，可是几次按照原订计划实验都失败了。
    后来，经过全体工人们刻苦钻研和到外地参观，绘出了第一张土法锁道运输的图纸来。
    后来，他们不知花费了多少个夜晚，终于用土办法，在崇山峻岭中架起了第一条长达三百七十五公尺的高空运输线。这条高空运输线的成功，一个人操作一天就能运下一百吨矿石，提高了工作效率十三点三倍，使运送矿石变成了一种极为轻松的工作。
    当工人们看到木斗上满载的矿石从山顶迅速向下飞落的情景，都情不自禁地拍手喝采，他们说：“思想一解放，矿石也就行在峭壁悬崖了！
                矿山一青年
    傍晚，山头上吹起了收工号，嘹喨清脆的号声召唤着劳动了一天的工人转入休息。
    这时候青年工人翟树方扛着镐头从山上边哼着小曲走下来……。他充满了乐观，充满了对矿山强烈的爱情。问他为什么这么乐？他顺手指了指西边那座辉映着金色霞光的山岭说：“那个大山上最近也发现了铁矿，今年如果矿区扩大了，实现了半机械化，我一定要学开风钻机！”他那双明亮的眼睛所闪现的光彩告诉了人们，他对生活有着无限的热爱与美好的憧憬。
    为实现美好明天而艰苦奋战的普通建设者们，祖国辈出的英雄们，你们的干劲将和金色的山岭一样永远会受到人们的爱慕。
