Participating in Labor Training to Enrich Learning Content
Nanjing Agricultural College Teachers and Students Reap Great Rewards After Four Months of Working Down Below

    (Our report) Nanjing Agricultural College teachers and students, working down below in the Xuzhou Special District brigade, have gained much in production, teaching, scientific research, and ideological transformation during their four-plus months of labor training in the Hongqi People's Commune of Guanhu, Pi County. In the "field classroom," this brigade organized teachers, veteran farmers, production experts, and specialized students to give lectures to students of all grades more than 140 times, and led teachers and students throughout the special district counties to seek teachers and visit friends. To date, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, the entire brigade has adopted a method combining the Party Committee, teachers, students, and the masses to compile 93 types of teaching material drafts, totaling more than 850,000 words; 79 out of 272 scientific research tasks have been preliminarily completed, more than 230,000 words of scientific papers and reports have been written, and more than 60 copies of high-yield summary reports have been compiled. In addition, it has helped the commune establish 41 amateur schools and 24 nurseries. Of the entire brigade of more than 530 teachers and students, 95 have recently been rated as models by the commune.
    Teachers and students of the Agricultural Machinery Department's Class of '64 created wooden-rail trolleys and earthen cranes on water conservancy construction sites, and sweet potato slicers, washing machines, and bread slicers for the cafeteria; they also created fertilizer spreaders for agricultural production. Influenced by the soaring enthusiasm of the commune members, the thinking of the teachers and students in this class has changed greatly, and many are not afraid of hardship, dirt, or fatigue in their work. Eighteen of the 33 teachers and students in the class were commended, and 12 were rated as models.
    Teachers and students of the Plant Protection Department's Class of '52 discovered rust during last year's wheat field pest inspection. After research, they concluded that summer spores can overwinter, breaking the long-standing theory, unanimously recognized by the plant protection community for many years, that northern summer spores cannot overwinter. To date, they have conducted research on more than a dozen scientific research projects, such as seed potato storage, the occurrence and prevention of beet armyworms, the prevention and treatment of wheat rust, and the occurrence and prevention of cutworms, and have obtained preliminary conclusions.
    During their work down below, teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department learned from local expert Xi Mingguang about forcing estrus in livestock and eliminating barrenness, and learned from traditional Chinese veterinarians the eight major syndromes of cold and heat, interior and exterior, deficiency and excess, and pathogenic and antipathogenic factors, as well as the principles of acupuncture efficacy, greatly enriching their veterinary knowledge. At present, they have completed 15 scientific research reports, such as "Introduction to the Experience of Draught Animal Breeding," and have produced the first batch of swine enzootic pneumonia vaccine.
    The Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Department has helped the commune successfully trial-produce phosphate fertilizer, bone meal, and other fertilizers, 13 kinds of native pesticides such as tobacco stems and castor bean roots, and 14 kinds of chemical products such as native white soap, sweet potato fruit candy, corn cob candy, and activated carbon.

    参加劳动锻炼　充实学习内容
    南京农学院师生下放四个月收获巨大
    本报讯　南京农学院下放徐州专区大队的师生，在邳县官湖红旗人民公社四个多月的劳动锻炼中，生产、教学、科学研究和思想改造，都有了不少的收获。这个大队在“田头课堂”上，先后组织教师、老农、生产能手和专业学生，给各年级学生讲课一百四十多次，并带领师生走遍专区各县寻师访友。到目前为止，全大队在党总支领导下，采取党委、教师、学生和群众四结合的方法，编写了九十三种教材初稿共八十五万多字；二百七十二项科学研究任务初步完成了七十九项，写出科学论文和报告二十三万多字，编写了丰产总结报告六十多份。此外，并帮助公社建立了四十一所业余学校，二十四所托儿所。全大队五百三十多个师生，最近被公社评为模范的就有九十五人。
    农机系六四班的师生，在水利工地上，创制了木轨小车、土起重机，给食堂创造了山芋切片机、洗涤机、切馒头机；为农业生产创造了施肥车。这个班的师生在社员冲天干劲的影响下，思想有很大变化，很多人在劳动中不怕苦、不怕脏、不怕累。全班师生三十三人中有十八人受到表扬，十二人被评为模范。
    植保系五二班师生，在去年检查麦田病害时，发现了锈病，经过研究得出了夏包子能越冬的结论，打破了以往许多年来为植物保护学界一致公认的北方夏包子不能越冬的立论。到目前为止，他们对种薯贮藏、斜文夜蛾的发生与防治、麦锈病的防治、粘虫的发生与防治等十几个科学研究项目，进行了研究，并获得了初步结论。
    畜牧兽医系师生在下放锻炼中，向土专家席明光学习了强制牲畜发情、消灭空怀的知识，向中兽医学习了寒热、里表、虚实、邪正八大症以及针灸疗效等原理，大大丰富了自己的兽医知识。目前，他们已完成“耕畜配种经验介绍”等十五项科学研究工作报告，制成了第一批猪喘气症的疫苗。
    土壤农化系，帮助公社试制成功了磷肥、骨粉等肥料，烟草茎、蓖麻根等十三种土农药和土白肥皂、山芋水果糖、玉米芯糖、活性炭等十四种化工产品。
