Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th - A red flag competition movement with the "high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties" as the goal has been launched in dozens of factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. On March 6th, more than a thousand advanced figures and worker representatives from mining, blast furnace, open-hearth furnace, rolling mill, transportation, machine repair, and capital construction departments gathered at the Municipal People's Auditorium to hold a skill competition broadcast conference with news of production successes from their units and competitive conditions proposed after discussions by all employees. The eighteen worker representatives who took the stage represented the firm oath of hundreds of thousands of steelworkers at Anshan Iron and Steel: we must, in this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward, produce steel products with greater quantity, better quality, and more complete varieties than last year to meet the needs of national economic construction.
	Today, 90,000 employees in Anshan who remain at their production posts listened to the live broadcast of the conference and skill competition.
	The first to take the stage was Zhang Yue, deputy director of the Ironmaking Plant, which is responsible for supplying all steelmaking raw materials to Anshan Iron and Steel. He represented the 2,000 employees of the plant in saying that from March onwards, the entire plant would focus on shift production and daily production plans; implement daily inspections, ten-day evaluations, and monthly summaries with rewards; and carry out high-yield and high-quality competitions between furnaces, groups, and work sections to create conditions for producing more and better pig iron in the second quarter. Immediately afterward, worker representatives from Dagushan Mine, Sintering General Plant, and Chemical General Plant, which produce ironmaking raw materials, successively took the stage, expressing their intention to produce a "rich feast" to make the blast furnaces "eat their fill and eat well," and to challenge the Ironmaking Plant with this as a condition. Geng Yulong, the electric shovel driver chief of Dagushan Mine, stated on stage that the entire mine's employees were determined to mine 10 million tons of iron ore this year, produce 3.4 million tons of concentrate powder, and supply the sintering plant to manufacture high-quality artificial rich ore. He initiated a proposal to the Cherry Orchard and Dong Anshan Mine employees to carry out a friendly competition, and the worker representatives of the Sintering General Plant expressed their intention to produce artificial rich ore to meet the needs of ironmaking. The representative of the Chemical General Plant, which supplies all metallurgical coke for ironmaking, proposed that on the basis of completing the production plans for January and February, they would carry out a competition in March comparing output with operating rate, quality with variety, safety with equipment maintenance, coordination with support, and measures with advanced experience, and would try to reduce coke ash content and improve coke quality to create conditions for high production in the Ironmaking Plant.
	Worker representatives from various steelmaking plants challenged and responded to challenges one after another, forming the climax of today's skill competition conference. Wang Linghao, a representative to the National Advanced Producers' Conference and a labor model of Anshan City, representing the workers of the First Steelmaking Plant, stated that in the red flag competition, all employees of the plant must strengthen cooperation between furnaces, break through the slag running and steel running barriers, strengthen furnace body repairs, expand furnace loading, ensure that the furnaces are loaded more and smelted quickly, and achieve a ingot rate of 99.3%, to create conditions for the rolling mill to produce high-quality steel. As soon as Wang Linghao finished speaking, the worker representatives of the Second Steelmaking Plant ran to the stage and announced the plant's conditions for accepting the challenge. Immediately afterward, worker representatives from a large fixed open-hearth furnace, which over-fulfilled the February steel production plan by more than 10,000 tons, took the stage and announced new goals. They proposed to resolutely complete the March steel production plan and strive for a complete victory in the steel production task for the first quarter; ensure that the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace bottom is increased to 8.34 tons in March, an increase of 0.59 tons compared to February and 1.17 tons compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and eliminate unqualified low-temperature steel.
	At today's skill competition conference, representatives from various rolling mills, transportation departments, machine repair factories, and capital construction sites also took the stage one after another, announcing the production news of their units and proposing the challenge and response conditions of their units. When Wang Chonglun, the nationally renowned labor model, took the stage, more than 1,000 representatives at the conference gave him thunderous applause to welcome this representative from the machine repair department of Anshan Iron and Steel. Wang Chonglun said that the mechanical repair and fitting plant where he works had over-fulfilled the task of mechanical repair and the creation of equipment parts in February. In March, all employees of the plant are determined to carry out a red flag competition to compare high output, high quality, high enthusiasm, and high measures, to ensure that the produced machinery equipment and mechanical parts are delivered to the production factories and mines in advance.
	This skill competition conference is a grand gathering of heroes from all walks of life in Anshan Iron and Steel. Even before the conference was held, the vast number of employees in the factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel had already launched a red flag competition between factories, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and groups in conjunction with discussing the national plan. The workers of the Ironmaking Plant took the lead, with the average daily output of pig iron in the first five days of March increasing by 4.2% compared to February. In the competition among the steelmaking open-hearth furnaces, new production records also continued to appear. In the first three days of March alone, six open-hearth furnaces, including No. 1, No. 9, No. 11, No. 14, No. 20, and No. 22, exceeded production by more than 900 tons of steel. The two rolling mills in the rolling system – the First Medium Plate and the Second Medium Plate Plant – which have been engaged in inter-factory friendship competitions since the beginning of this year, after over-fulfilling the plans for January and February, rolled out 8,107 tons of high-quality steel plates from March 1st to 5th, exceeding the plan by 3%.
	Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at today's skill competition conference. He pointed out that in the national battle to seize 18 million tons of steel this year, all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel bear an extremely arduous and glorious task. He called on the employees of all factories and mines to immediately launch a production upsurge, carry out a vigorous red flag competition, and strive to complete Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production tasks for this year ahead of schedule.
	During the conference, the employees who remained at their production posts listening to the radio broadcast called and wrote to the conference one after another, reporting their new production achievements and submitting guarantees, challenges, and responses. They expressed their firm response to the call of the Party and strove to over-fulfill the production plans for March and the first quarter to create conditions for completing the annual steel production plan ahead of schedule.
