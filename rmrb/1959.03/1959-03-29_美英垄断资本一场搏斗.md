A Bout Between U.S. and British Monopoly Capital

    While politicians in Washington and London are grandly singing the tune of "interdependence" on television, the monopoly capitalists of the United States and Britain have been engaged in a fierce life-and-death trade battle.

    This battle took place recently at a special meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal, Canada. The main purpose of the meeting was to determine which company would obtain the manufacturing rights for international standard aviation safety equipment. Representatives from airlines in Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Canada, and other countries attended the meeting. To conceal the truth of the infighting, the special meeting adopted a secret consultation method. Nevertheless, because the noise at the venue escalated to the point of drawing swords, the inside scandals have spread like wildfire, becoming material for discussions and laughter in public opinion in various countries.

    Obtaining the manufacturing rights for standard aviation equipment is a lucrative business. It is said that its turnover is at least several million pounds. At a time when the sales crisis in the capitalist world is deepening, this kind of good business naturally makes monopoly capital from various countries covet it, trying to seize it for themselves.

    The Decca company, a British manufacturer of aviation safety equipment, showed great interest in this profitable deal. In order to support this company's victory in the competition, the British government and the British bourgeois press put in a great effort. The British Ministry of Transport publicly promoted the quality of Decca's products, saying that it greatly exceeded the American equipment that the International Civil Aviation Organization had always used. In early February, the British Ministry of Transport used jet passenger planes traveling between London and Paris to conduct live demonstrations, attempting to prove that Decca's products could best ensure aviation safety and prevent the tragedy of mid-air collisions. The British Ministry of Transport also stated that civil aircraft equipped with Decca's aviation safety equipment would receive preferential treatment when arriving in Britain.

    However, this large-scale competitive activity by the British side aroused strong opposition from American monopoly capital. Originally, the International Civil Aviation Organization had been using safety equipment manufactured by American companies. Now, although the term of the U.S. manufacturing rights has expired, American companies are trying to continue to dominate this right and prevent British involvement.

    At the Montreal meeting, Pan American Airlines, in the posture of a hegemon, exerted strong pressure, forcing representatives from Air France, KLM, Canadian Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines and other companies to jointly deal with Britain and oppose the use of British Decca's safety equipment. The only supporters of the British proposal were British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways.

    When the British company suffered such great oppression and exclusion from the United States, some people wanted to say a few fair words for Britain.

    For example, members of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations once expressed that British-made products were more reliable. However, for fear of offending the United States, the association's spokesperson immediately stated that this was a private opinion and not the official opinion of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations.

    The American delegation's crude methods naturally aroused full resistance from the British representatives, and a sharp struggle unfolded at the meeting. After making a lot of noise, the British representatives were ultimately unable to do anything due to their weak position. The meeting finally passed a resolution extending the use of American equipment to 1975.

    The "unpleasant results" of the Montreal meeting aroused a wave of indignation in Britain. The British "Financial Times" called it "an air quarrel." A spokesman for Decca bitterly said: "This is a political decision, not a decision based on technical conditions. This cannot be regarded as the final decision of the meeting, but only as a decision by employers who have made large investments in American equipment manufacturing."

    Moreover, the Montreal meeting also stirred up the British monopoly capital's resentment towards their American "partners." At the Decca company's shareholders meeting on February 26, the chairman of the board of directors pointed out with grief that Decca's marine safety equipment had originally been used by more than 5,000 ships. However, under the direction of American monopoly capital, the U.S. Coast Guard prohibited ships equipped with Decca equipment from docking in U.S. ports, so British, French, Swedish, Dutch, and American ships sailing across the Atlantic could not use the British company's safety equipment. On March 11, British Trade Minister Erroll, in a speech in London, also openly complained that the United States was attacking Britain in trade. Erroll also listed a series of examples of British companies being excluded and attacked by the United States. It seems that the sharp struggle for markets between U.S. and British monopoly capital, exacerbated by the Montreal meeting, will continue to develop.

    美英垄断资本一场搏斗
    正当华盛顿和伦敦的政客们在电视台上冠冕堂皇地高唱“相互依靠”曲调的时候，美英两国的垄断资本家又进行了一场你死我活的激烈的贸易搏斗。
    这场搏斗发生在不久以前在加拿大蒙特利尔举行的国际民用航空组织特别会议上。这次会议的主要内容，是要确定哪家公司将获得国际标准航空安全设备的制造权。会议有英、美、法、荷、加等国航空公司的代表参加。为了掩盖勾心斗角的真相，这次特别会议采取了秘密协商的方式。尽管如此，由于会场的吵闹发展到了剑拔弩张的地步，其中的内幕丑闻已经不胫而走，成为世界各国舆论谈笑的资料。
    获得标准航空设备的制造权，是一笔利润可观的好生意。据说，它的营业额至少有几百万英镑。在当前资本主义世界销售危机日益加深的时候，这种好生意自然使各国垄断资本垂涎三尺，力图把它攫为己有。
    对于这桩有利可图的交易，英国制造航空安全设备的德卡公司表现了很大的兴趣。为了支持这家公司在竞争中得胜，英国政府和英国资产阶级报刊卖了很大的力气。英国运输部公开出面宣扬德卡公司产品的质量，说它大大地超过了国际民用航空组织一向采用的美国设备。2月初，英国运输部利用往返伦敦、巴黎间的喷气式客机作了实地表演，试图证明德卡公司的产品最能保障航空安全、防止空中飞机互撞的惨剧。英国运输部并且声明，凡是装配着德卡公司航空安全设备的民航机，飞抵英国时将受到优待。
    但是，英国方面这种大张旗鼓的竞争活动，引起了美国垄断资本的强烈对抗。原来，在此之前，国际民用航空组织是采用美国公司制造的安全设备的。现在虽然美国制造权的期限已满，但是美国公司却力图继续霸占这种权利，不让英国插手。
    在蒙特利尔会议上，泛美航空公司以霸主的姿态，施加了强大的压力，迫使法国航空公司、荷兰航空公司、加拿大航空公司、斯堪的纳维亚航空公司等企业的代表一齐对付英国，反对采用英国德卡公司的安全设备。而支持英国建议的只有不列颠海外航空公司、不列颠欧洲航空公司。
    在英国公司遭受美国这么大欺压与排挤的时候，也曾有人想替英国说几句公道话。
    例如，航空驾驶员国际协会的会员们就曾经表示，英国制造的产品比较可靠。但是由于怕触怒美国，该会发言人立即声明，这是私人的意见，不是航空驾驶员国际协会的正式意见。
    美国代表团这种蛮横的手法，自然引起英国代表全力抵抗，在会场上展开了尖锐的斗争。英国代表吵闹一番之后，终因势单力薄，无济于事。会议最后通过决议，把美国设备的采用期延长到1975年。
    蒙特利尔会议的“令人不愉快的结果”，在英国激起了一片愤慨。英国“金融时报”把它评为“一场空中的争吵”。德卡公司的发言人愤愤不平地说：“这是一个政治性的决定，不是一个根据技术条件而作的决定。这不能当作是会议的最后决定，只能算为在美国设备制造方面进行着大量投资的雇主们的决定。”
    不仅如此，蒙特利尔会议还勾起了英国垄断资本对他们的美国“伙伴”的积怨。在2月26日德卡公司股东会议上，公司董事会主席满怀悲愤地指出，德卡公司的航海安全设备本来已为五千多艘轮船所采用。但是在美国垄断资本的指使下，美国海岸国民警卫队禁止装备着德卡公司设备的船只在美国港口停靠，因此航行于大西洋两岸间的英、法、瑞典、荷兰以及美国的轮船却无法采用这家英国公司的安全设备。3月11日，英国贸易大臣埃克尔斯在伦敦发表的谈话中，也公开抱怨美国在贸易上打击英国，埃克尔斯还算了一笔账，列举英国企业遭受美国排挤和打击的一系列实例。看来，由蒙特利尔会议而加剧的美英两国垄断资本争夺市场的尖锐斗争，还要进一步发展下去。（附图片）
