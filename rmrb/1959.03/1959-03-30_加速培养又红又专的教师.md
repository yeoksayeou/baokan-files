Since last year, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, education has also greatly developed. New schools have been established in batches, and old schools have been continuously expanded. Whether it is general education or worker-peasant education, full-time schools or part-time schools, spare-time schools, all require teachers with corresponding levels. Therefore, although we already have a considerable professional education worker team, it is far from meeting the objective requirements in terms of quantity or quality, from the current needs or from the long-term needs. We must take active measures to cultivate more teachers in a planned and effective manner, solve the problem of insufficient quantity, and gradually improve the quality of teachers to meet the needs of the development of education.

What kind of teachers do we need? This is determined by the role of education. Education is one of the powerful weapons of class struggle. The bourgeoisie runs bourgeois education to serve the bourgeoisie. The working class must also run working-class education to serve the cause of the working class. The purpose of socialist education is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, establish a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals, and serve the construction of socialism and the realization of communist ideals. To achieve this goal, we need a huge teacher force that has socialist and communist ideas and can dedicate itself to the cause of education for the working class. Only teachers who are both red and expert can have a firm working-class political direction, serve the politics of the working class wholeheartedly, contribute their talents and wisdom to the socialist education cause loyally, pay attention to improving students' socialist consciousness, follow the path of socialist education, and resist the erosion of bourgeois educational thought. Similarly, only teachers who are both red and expert can better impart knowledge to students and guide students in learning, continuously improve their professional level in teaching practice and labor practice, improve the quality of teaching, strive to meet the requirements of their teaching grade and subject, and cultivate more and better socialist construction talents. Being expert but not red cannot correctly serve the socialist education cause; being red but not expert cannot meet the needs of socialist education. Only when teachers are both red and expert, red through and expert deep, can they better implement the Party's education policy under the leadership of the Party.

At present, we already have a certain number of teachers with a certain level. After rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, after self-ideological revolution and the practice of productive labor, many teachers have broken away from bourgeois ideology to varying degrees, established proletarian ideology, and continuously improved teaching methods and teaching quality. Some of them can serve the people loyally, and some have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and become members of the working class vanguard. However, some teachers still retain bourgeois positions and have more bourgeois ideas, viewpoints, and styles. Therefore, education administrative departments and schools should continue to implement the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, and strive to win over all possible teachers to serve the cause of socialist education. And actively help them politically and ideologically, so that they abandon non-proletarian positions and stand on the working-class position, and serve the cause of the working class wholeheartedly. Those old teachers who are deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, as long as they sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, work hard to change their bourgeois positions, viewpoints, and styles, and strive to improve their teaching skills, they may become an active force in the teacher force of socialist education.

The fundamental way to strengthen and expand the working-class teacher force is to continuously transport new blood to the education front. The sources of new teachers are no more than two aspects: first, the state selects some people from the existing cadres to work as teachers; second, opening classes and establishing schools to train new forces. The state has made great efforts to transfer teachers from cadres in the past few years, but this source is ultimately limited. The more important method is to cultivate and train new teachers in a planned, step-by-step, and active manner. The method of training teachers should be a combination of short-term training and long-term cultivation, a "walking on two legs" approach. Short-term training courses have played a positive role in improving teachers' level and training new teachers. Since last year, Changshou County, Sichuan Province, has established 83 accelerated normal schools and organized nearly 2,000 teachers to study in the schools. Through three to four months of study, teachers have improved the quality of teaching, and also improved their political and cultural levels, making "cadres satisfied, students satisfied, and the masses satisfied." This short-term training method should continue to be held. As the development of education is booming, all localities should also let go and develop normal education, and cultivate reserve forces of teachers. Now, in order to meet the needs of the constantly developing education cause, all localities have established a large number of normal schools, including junior normal to secondary and higher normal, including spare-time, part-time and full-time normal schools. Hebei Province attaches importance to the development of normal education. In addition to establishing a complete normal education system, it also set up normal classes, junior normal classes and preschool teacher classes attached to the original middle schools and normal schools in various counties. The study time is one or two years, and some are three or four years. Taking various methods can make normal education develop rapidly.

In order to train more new teachers, while the state runs normal education, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to run normal schools under the leadership of the Party. Only in this way can normal education be run more, faster, better, and more economically, and better adapt to the new situation of the development of education. Many localities have a shortage of teachers for preschool education, adult spare-time education, and primary schools, and their level urgently needs to be improved. The state cannot meet the requirements by running normal schools for a while. Some localities put the problem to the masses for discussion, and everyone said, "Let us also run schools for training teachers!" It can be seen that since the masses have the enthusiasm to run education, they will also have the enthusiasm to train teachers. All localities should give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running normal education. Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, took the mass line, and through key experiments, used facts to refute the argument that "the masses cannot run normal schools." From point to surface, gradually promoted, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, various types of normal schools, in addition to training and improving the in-service primary school teachers and some ordinary middle school and agricultural middle school teachers, also trained new primary school teachers and adult spare-time education teachers. All localities can mobilize the masses to run normal education according to needs and possibilities. Education administrative departments should strengthen guidance and assistance, and pay attention to improving the quality of teacher training. Any work of the Party is inseparable from the mass line, and the work of training teachers is also the same.

In the work of training teachers, while vigorously solving the problem of teachers in primary schools, junior high schools and adult education, we should also pay attention to cultivating teachers in higher education as soon as possible. In the cultivation of teachers in higher education, national key universities and other schools with conditions can enroll graduate students, receive advanced teachers, and train backbone teachers for other schools; they can also select and retain a group of excellent students from university graduates and returned students to work as teaching assistants in the school, and cultivate and improve them in their work. Education administrative departments and universities should formulate long-term and overall plans for cultivating and improving teachers based on the development plan of education, and make practical arrangements.

The issue of how to train teachers who are both red and expert is related to our next generation and to the education cause that is directly related to socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, party organizations at all levels need to strengthen their leadership over the work of training teachers. Since liberation, especially since the great development of education in 1958, it has been fully demonstrated that as long as the party committee attaches importance to the issue of teachers and takes the lead in grasping it, this problem can be completely solved. In the past, we have achieved many achievements and considerable experience in the work of cultivating and expanding the teacher force. In the future, we must work harder and use various methods to effectively and quickly allocate and cultivate more and better teachers, so that the working-class teacher force that is both red and expert will continue to develop and grow.

### 加速培养又红又专的教师

    加速培养又红又专的教师
    去年以来，随着工农业生产的大跃进，教育事业也有了很大的发展。新学校成批地建立，老学校不断地扩大。无论普通教育或工农教育，全日制学校或半日制学校、业余学校，处处都需要具有相应水平的教师。因此，现在我们虽然已经有了一支相当可观的专业教育工作者队伍，但是无论在数量上或者质量上，从目前的需要或者从长远的需要看，都还远远不能满足客观实际的要求。我们必须采取积极措施，有计划而又有成效地培养更多的师资，解决数量不够的问题，并逐步地提高师资质量，以适应教育事业发展的需要。
    我们需要什么样的师资呢？这是由教育的作用而决定的。教育是阶级斗争的有力的武器之一。资产阶级办资产阶级的教育，为资产阶级服务。工人阶级也要办工人阶级的教育，为工人阶级的事业服务。社会主义教育的目的，是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，建立一支强大的工人阶级知识分子队伍，为建设社会主义和实现共产主义的理想服务。要达到这个目的，就需要具有社会主义和共产主义思想的、能够献身于工人阶级教育事业的一支又红又专的庞大的教师队伍。只有又红又专的教师，才能具有坚定的工人阶级的政治方向，全心全意地为工人阶级的政治服务，忠心耿耿地为社会主义的教育事业贡献自己的才智，注意提高学生的社会主义觉悟，遵循社会主义教育事业的道路，抵制资产阶级教育思想的侵蚀。同样的，只有又红又专的教师，才能更好地向学生传授和指导学生学习知识，在教学实践和劳动实践的过程中，不断提高自己的业务水平，提高教学业务的质量，努力适应自己教学的年级和学科的要求，培养出更多更好的社会主义的建设人才。只专不红，固然不能正确地为社会主义教育事业服务；只红不专，也是不能适应社会主义教育需要的。教师只有又红又专，红透专深，才能在党的领导下，更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针。
    目前我们已经有了一定数量的和具有一定水平的师资。经过整风和反右派斗争，经过自我的思想革命和生产劳动的实践，已经有不少教师不同程度地破除了资产阶级的思想，树立起无产阶级的思想，不断地改进教学方法，提高教学质量。其中有人能够忠心耿耿地为人民服务，有人已经光荣地参加了中国共产党，成为工人阶级先锋队的一分子。但是，也有一部分教师，还保留着资产阶级立场，还有着较多的资产阶级的思想观点和作风。因此，教育行政部门和学校应当继续贯彻执行党的团结改造知识分子的政策，争取一切可能争取的教师为社会主义的教育事业服务。并从政治上思想上积极地帮助他们，使他们放弃非无产阶级立场，站到工人阶级立场上来，全心全意为工人阶级的事业服务。那些受资产阶级影响较深的老教师，只要他们诚心接受党的领导，努力改变自己的资产阶级立场、观点和作风，并在教学业务上努力提高，他们就有可能变成社会主义教育事业的教师队伍中的一支积极的力量。
    加强并壮大工人阶级教师队伍的根本途径，是不断输送新的血液到教育战线上去。新的师资的来源不外两个方面：第一，由国家从现有干部中间挑选一些人去作教师；第二，开班设校培养训练新生力量。从干部中调配教师，国家几年来已经作了很大的努力，但这个来源终究是有限的，更重要的方法还是有计划有步骤而又积极地培养和训练新师资。培养师资的办法，应该采取短期训练和长期培养相结合的“两条腿走路”的办法。短期轮训班在目前对提高教师水平，培养新教师起了积极作用。四川省长寿县去年以来，办了速成师范学校八十三所，组织了近两千教师入校学习。教师通过三个月到四个月的学习，提高了教学的质量，还提高了政治水平和文化水平，使“干部满意，学员满意，群众满意”。这种短期轮训的办法，应该继续举办。由于教育事业的发展方兴未艾，各地也还要放手发展师范教育，培养师资的后备力量。现在，各地为了适应不断发展的教育事业的需要，已经兴办了大量的师范学校，包括初级师范到中等和高等师范，包括业余的、半日制的和全日制的师范学校。河北省重视发展师范教育，除了建立完整的师范教育体系以外，还在各县原有中学、师范内附设了师范班、初师班和幼师班。学习时间有一、二年的，也有三、四年的。采取多种多样的办法，就能使师范教育迅速发展起来。
    为了更多地培养新的师资，在国家举办师范教育的同时，还有必要在党的领导下，发动群众来办师范。只有这样，才能把师范教育办得多快好省，更好地适应教育事业发展的新形势。许多地方幼儿教育师资、成人业余教育师资、小学师资都很不足，水平也急需提高。国家办师范一时也不能满足要求。有的地方把问题交给群众讨论，大家都说，“让我们也来办培养教师的学校吧！”可见群众既然有办教育的积极性，也就会有培养教师的积极性。各地就要充分发挥群众办师范教育的积极性。江苏省昆山县走群众路线，通过重点实验，用事实驳倒了“群众不能办师范”的论调。由点到面，逐步推广，在各级党委的领导下，各类师范学校，除了培养提高在职的小学教师和部分普通中学、农业中学的教师外，还培养了新的小学教师和成人业余教育的教师。各地都可以根据需要和可能，发动群众来办师范教育。教育行政部门应该加强指导和帮助，注意提高培养师资的质量。党的任何工作，都离不开群众路线，培养教师的工作也是这样。
    在培养师资的工作中，与大力解决小学、初中和成人教育的师资问题的同时，也要及早注意培养高等教育的师资问题。在培养高等教育师资方面，全国重点高等学校及其它有条件的学校可以招收研究生，接收进修教师，为其他学校培养骨干教师；还可以从高等学校毕业生和回国留学生中选留一批优秀的学生在学校担任助教，在工作中加以培养提高。教育行政部门和高等学校，对于培养提高教师的工作，应该根据教育事业的发展规划，制定出长期的、全盘的培养提高教师的规划，并且作出切实的安排来。
    如何培养又红又专的教师问题，关系到我们的下一代，关系到同社会主义革命和社会主义建设有直接联系的教育事业，因此各地党组织有必要加强对培养教师工作的领导。解放以来、尤其是1958年教育事业大发展以来，充分说明了，只要党委重视师资问题，亲自动手来抓，这个问题是完全可以解决的。过去我们在培养壮大教师队伍的工作中，已经取得了许多的成就和相当的经验，今后我们更要努力，用各种办法，有效地迅速地调配和培养更多更好的师资，使又红又专的工人阶级的教师队伍不断地发展壮大。
