Xinhua News Agency, Prague. Czechoslovakian production cooperatives (excluding unified agricultural cooperatives) and consumer cooperatives, under the unified national plan and the leadership of the state-owned economy, are actively playing the role of powerful assistants to state-owned industry and commerce.

Currently, Czechoslovakia has 700 production cooperatives, employing 140,000 workers, producing 25,000 kinds of goods, and occupying a non-negligible position in the country's industrial production. For example, metal production cooperatives are responsible for 80% of the country's camera production, 15% of washing machine production, and 13% of vacuum cleaner production. Wood production cooperatives produce one-fifth of the country's agricultural tools, sports equipment, furniture, and toys. Production cooperatives also include some special industries engaged in jewelry processing, as well as the production of folk handicrafts such as embroidery, lace, pottery, and glassware.

Production cooperatives also provide other various services to residents, such as repairs. They effectively make up for the shortcomings of state-owned enterprises and satisfy people's individual preferences and desires.

One of the characteristics of production cooperatives is that they all use local materials or waste materials from factories as raw materials. Much of the leather, wood, cotton, and wool that is no longer suitable for industrial production can still be used by production cooperatives.

    生产二万多种商品满足居民多样需要
    捷生产合作社作用巨大
    新华社布拉格讯　捷克斯洛伐克生产合作社（不包括统一农业合作社）和消费合作社在国家统一计划和国营经济领导下，正积极发挥着国营工商业的有力助手的作用。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克有七百个生产合作社，拥有十四万工人，生产着二万五千种商品，在国家工业生产中占有不可忽视的地位。如金属生产合作社担负了全国80％的照像机、15％的洗衣机和13％的吸尘器的生产。木器生产合作社生产着全国五分之一的农具、运动器械、家具和玩具。生产合作社还包括一些特殊性质的行业，从事珠宝加工，以及刺绣、花边、陶器、玻璃器皿等民间手工艺品的生产。
    生产合作社也为居民提供其他各种服务，如修理等。它们有效地弥补了国营企业的不足，满足了人们的个别嗜好和愿望。
    生产合作社的特色之一是：它们都是在本地取材或利用来自工厂的废料作原料。许多已不适用于工业生产的皮革、木材、棉花、毛线，仍然能够为生产合作社所利用。
