Relying on the unified planning and close collaboration of the Party Committee
Railway hub design is fast and good

    (Our report) The Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, under the leadership of the local Party committee and fully relying on local initiative, has achieved greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the design of the Dalian, Yingkou, Fushun, and Anshan railway hubs, achieving an all-round leap forward.

    In the past, railway hub design work was carried out by a small number of technical personnel. They went to various economic enterprises to investigate economic and transport volume data, discussed land use and demolition issues, and conducted on-site surveys and designs, which generally took one to two years to complete the detailed construction drawings. During this one to two year period, various situations changed greatly, forcing the design to be constantly reworked and revised. At the same time, because hub projects occupied a large area, disputes and delays often arose over demolition and urban planning issues.

    Since last year, the Party Committee of the Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly instructed design personnel to conduct hub design under the leadership of the local Party Committee. Design personnel, in carrying out the design work of Dalian, Yingkou, Fushun, and Anshan hubs, closely relied on the leadership of the local Party Committee, and quickly changed the previous situation of delays, rework, and low quality.

    These four cities have established railway hub comprehensive design teams, directly led by the municipal Party committee, with the participation of the municipal planning commission, municipal construction bureau, railway transportation department, and railway design department. The comprehensive design teams frequently convened meetings of the Party secretaries and factory directors of relevant industrial and mining enterprises to discuss and resolve issues such as data supply, investment, land use, demolition, and materials in the design work. During on-site surveys, the urban construction bureau introduced local geological and hydrological conditions and put forward opinions based on urban planning. The railway bureau put forward opinions based on transportation needs and existing station conditions. The design personnel, based on the actual situation on the ground, uniformly considered the requirements of all parties, established various comparison schemes, selected schemes for explanation, introduction, and recommendation to the municipal Party committee and comprehensive design team for approval, and widely listened to the opinions of relevant industrial and mining enterprises and railway workers.

    Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" and ensuring the greater, faster, better, and more economical construction of railway hubs, relevant units and industrial and mining enterprises in Dalian, Yingkou, Fushun, and Anshan regarded the railway hub design work as their own task and shared the responsibility.

    In the Dalian hub design, the economic data sent by various industrial and mining enterprises in three days was more than the design unit collected in two or three months. The municipal construction bureau specially assigned people to conduct a comprehensive survey and provide topographic maps. Some mines proposed that they had technicians and air pumps and were willing to contract all the stonework of the station project, and were willing to take out steel rails that could be laid for twenty kilometers to support the hub construction. Some factories, seeing that the hub design scheme greatly increased the vehicle marshalling capacity of the station, decided to take out the budget originally planned for the construction of an in-plant marshalling station for the state to expand the hub.

    The hub design work in Dalian, Yingkou, Fushun, and Anshan has achieved high quality and speed. The Dalian hub, which has been designed and completed, only took forty days, which is twice as high as the leap-forward work efficiency stipulated by the Third Design Institute last year, and the number of design personnel involved was only four. Moreover, due to the unified leadership and overall layout of the municipal Party committee, the cooperation and support of various units, and the adoption of the opinions of all parties, the selection of station plans, the interference of special lines, and the possible occurrence of diseases have all been solved practically. Therefore, local departments and enterprises are satisfied, and there has not been a single design rework. The Fushun hub also saved 2 million yuan in project costs and 600,000 yuan in annual operating costs due to reasonable route selection and high design quality by merely restoring a section of the South Trunk Line.

    依靠党委统筹安排通力协作
    铁路枢纽设计又快又好
    本报讯　铁道部第三设计院在当地党委领导下，充分依靠地方积极性，在大连、营口、抚顺、鞍山四个铁路枢纽的设计中实现了多快好省、全面跃进。
    过去，铁路枢纽设计工作都是由少数技术人员进行的，他们到各个经济企业单位调查经济、运量等资料，商量用地、拆迁事宜，进行现场踏勘设计，直到完成施工详图，一般需要一、二年时间。在这一、二年时间内，各种情况有很大变动，迫使设计不断返工修改。同时因为枢纽工程占地大，为了拆迁和城市规划问题也常常发生扯皮拖延现象。
    去年以来，铁道部第三设计院党委一再指示设计人员在进行枢纽设计时要在当地党委领导下进行。设计人员在进行大连、营口、抚顺、鞍山等枢纽设计工作中，紧密依靠当地党委领导，就很快改变了以往那种拖延、返工、质量不高的情况。
    这四个市分别组成了铁路枢纽综合设计小组，由市委直接领导，市计划委员会、市建设局、铁路运输部门和铁路设计部门参加。综合设计小组经常召开有关工矿企业党委书记、厂矿长会议，协商解决设计工作中的资料供给、投资、用地、拆迁、材料等问题。在现场踏勘中，城市建设局介绍当地地质、水文等情况，根据城市规划提出意见，铁路局根据运输的需要和现有站场情况提出意见，设计人员就根据现场实际情况，统一地考虑各方面的要求，订出多种比较方案、选择方案向市委和综合设计小组说明、介绍和推荐批审，并广泛听取有关工矿企业和铁路职工的意见。
    在全国一盘棋、保证多快好省建设铁路枢纽的思想指导下，大连、营口、抚顺、鞍山等地有关单位和工矿企业把铁路枢纽设计工作看成了自己的任务而分担起来。
    在大连枢纽设计中，各工矿企业三天中送来的经济资料，比设计单位两三个月收罗到的还要多。市建设局特地抽人全面测绘，供给了地形图。有的矿提出他们有技工有风泵愿意包下车站工程的全部石方，并愿意拿出可铺设二十公里长的钢轨支援枢纽建设。有的厂因为看到枢纽设计方案大大增加了车站的车辆编组能力，就决定把原定修建厂内编组站的预算拿出来给国家扩建枢纽使用。
    大连、营口、抚顺、鞍山的枢纽设计工作，都作到了质量高、速度快。已经设计完成的大连枢纽只用了四十天时间，比第三设计院去年规定的跃进工作效率还提高了两倍，而投入的设计人员只有四人。并且由于市委的统一领导、全面布局，各单位的协作和支持以及采纳了各方面的意见，对站场方案的选择，专用线路的干扰和可能发生的病害都作了切合实际的解决，因此当地各部门、企业满意，而没有发生一次设计返工。抚顺枢纽也因为选线合理、设计质量高，仅恢复南干线一段就可以节省工程费二百万元和每年的运营费六十万元。
