    Direct Experience and Indirect Experience
    Xu Feiguang
    To study books to death and become slaves to books, to only believe in books and not in reality—this is a prominent characteristic of the old education. As Lenin said, "One of the greatest misfortunes left to us by the old capitalist society is the complete separation of books from practice." In order to resolutely combat this bad tradition left over from thousands of years of human history, students in our schools, especially in universities and colleges, participated relatively more in social and production practices during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. As a result, not only has the students' political and ideological outlook changed, and a new atmosphere of facing reality, facing production, and loving labor and working people has been formed, but also the students' practical knowledge of society and production has been greatly enriched, and the knowledge originally learned has become useful and living knowledge.
    Our emphasis on students' direct participation in social and production practices, does this mean that we only need to gain knowledge from our own direct experience? Does it mean that we can disbelieve the experience of predecessors and others, and only believe in our own experience? Of course not. In order to reverse the tendency of the old education to be divorced from practice for thousands of years, it is absolutely necessary for us to emphasize direct participation in social and production practice, but emphasizing this aspect is by no means to abandon the practical experience of predecessors and others, but to establish a correct relationship between the two.
    Some people have participated in labor production and social practice, and then they believe that only their own practical experience is reliable, and all historical knowledge and book knowledge are dogmas and cannot be believed. They have made great progress from being divorced from production and social practice to participating in production and social practice; but they think that they can not learn from the experience of the ancients and others, which is wrong. The reason for this one-sided view is that they mechanically understand the materialistic principle that "all true knowledge originates from direct experience," but they do not see that their own experience comes from practice, and the experience of predecessors and others also comes from their practical activities. This experience is only indirect experience for us. Many people in the world have not been to the Americas, but they only know of its existence through Columbus and all those who have been there, but the existence of the Americas does not change because many people have not been there. We have not seen Confucius, but we only know that he did exist through the "Analects" and other records of his disciples, but the fact that Confucius existed does not change because we have not seen him.
    In fact, due to various limitations, it is impossible to acquire all knowledge through one's own direct experience, and most of it is acquired from indirect experience. Human beings have had recorded history for thousands of years, the universe is infinitely large, and there are infinitely many things in the world. A person's life can only directly experience a very short period of time and a very narrow scope. The development of science and culture can reach such a peak today precisely because people are starting their own practical activities on the basis of the experience of predecessors and others. They summarized the experience of predecessors and others, and after personal practice, they added their own experience to the treasure house of knowledge, becoming the indirect experience of future generations. Human knowledge has been accumulated generation after generation in this way. Mendeleev discovered the periodic law on the basis of the more than sixty elements that predecessors and others had already discovered. Once the periodic law was discovered, it became a weapon for future generations to further explore the internal laws of matter; but to understand the periodic law, it is not necessary for everyone to personally measure the atomic weight of each element. When Marx laid the foundation of Marxism, in addition to personally participating in the social struggle practice at that time, he had to summarize the sum of human knowledge through a large number of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign documents, that is, through indirect roads, and it was impossible to directly experience everything covered by his theory.
    Therefore, in a certain sense, it can be said that the question of attitude and view towards indirect knowledge is actually a question of attitude and view towards historical heritage and book knowledge.
    Historical experience basically belongs to the scope of indirect knowledge, because except for a small part of modern history, we cannot directly experience it. However, we must never underestimate or abandon the precious heritage of history. The reason why these historical heritages are important is that they are the experiences accumulated in the long-term practice and struggle of mankind, which contain very rich and proven "true knowledge." All the scientific and cultural achievements that human beings can achieve now have been developed on this basis. Without ancient clubs and stones, there would be no atomic generators today; without primitive bows and arrows, there would be no cosmic rockets today. If human beings were like "bears stealing corn," taking one and throwing away the original one, then we might still be in the stage of drinking blood. Precisely because of this, Lenin said: "Proletarian culture should be the inevitable result of the development of the total sum of knowledge created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist society, landlord society, and bureaucratic society." "Only by enriching our minds with all the knowledge treasures created by mankind can we become communists." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "Today's China is a development of historical China; we are Marxist historians, and we should not cut off history. From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should summarize and inherit this precious heritage. This is of important help in guiding the current great movement."
    Book knowledge is also mostly indirect knowledge for us, because books contain a large number of summaries of the experiences of predecessors and others that we cannot or have not experienced. We cannot look down on book knowledge either, because good book knowledge contains more content than personal direct experience, and it has been processed and refined into rational things. Without practical experience, theoretical knowledge cannot be produced, but once theory is produced, it can guide practice and give practice a clear goal. When the internal relationship of more than sixty elements was not found, we could not have any foresight about the discovery of new elements; but when Mendeleev discovered its internal relationship, that is, discovered the periodic law, he foresaw that we would discover some new elements, and history was realized as he predicted.
    Of course, we cannot conclude from this that indirect experience is enough, and our own direct experience is dispensable. On the contrary, we believe that people's direct experience still has its decisive significance, not only because both one's own experience and the experience of predecessors and others originate from direct experience, but also because people's practical activities are the main conditions for transforming nature and society. Learning from the experience of predecessors and others is not to delve into old papers and become bookworms, but to use it to guide our practice and further develop our science and culture through practice. Therefore, after learning book knowledge and historical knowledge, we must also use it (of course, we cannot require it to be useful immediately), and combine it with reality.
    Furthermore, we cannot think that all indirect experiences are reliable and can be absorbed indiscriminately. Those indirect experiences that have been tested and proven are of course reliable knowledge, and we must study them carefully. However, due to the limitations of human understanding and historical conditions, indirect experience must also contain some unreliable and distorted things. However, we must also study it carefully before we know that it is unreliable. In short, we cannot lightly affirm or deny indirect experience, but we must carefully study and research them, remove the dross, take the essence, criticize its wrong and unreliable things, and absorb its correct and reliable things.
    From the above, it can be seen that both indirect experience and direct experience have their limitations when viewed in isolation. Direct experience is the source of human knowledge, but it is impossible to reach the peak of knowledge on the basis of individual direct experience; indirect knowledge is the direct experience of predecessors and others, but before we have carefully studied and researched it, it is still someone else's thing, and the errors in it cannot be discovered.
    Therefore, we must both learn indirect knowledge and have our own direct knowledge; we must have both book knowledge and historical knowledge, and social and production practical experience. Both of these are produced on the basis of practice, and therefore can only be combined and unified on the basis of practice. Only in this way can we acquire rich and comprehensive knowledge and promote the continuous development of science and culture.

    直接经验和间接经验
    徐非光
    死读书，读死书；只相信书本，不相信实际，这是旧教育的一个突出的特点。正如列宁所说的，“旧时资本主义社会所遗留给我们的最大祸害之一，就是书本与实践完全隔离”。为了与人类历史几千年遗留下的这种恶劣传统进行坚决斗争，我国学校，特别是高等学校的学生在1958年大跃进中，曾经比较多地参加了社会和生产的实际。这样作的结果，不仅改变了学生的政治思想面貌，并使面向实际、面向生产、热爱劳动和劳动人民成为一种崭新的风气，而且大大地丰富了学生的社会和生产的实践知识，并使原来学到的知识变成有用的活的知识。
    我们强调学生直接参加社会和生产的实际，这是不是说，我们只要从自己的直接经验中获得知识就够了呢？是不是说，我们可以不相信前人和别人的经验，而仅仅相信自己的经验呢？当然不是这样。为了扭转几千年旧教育脱离实践的倾向，我们强调直接参加社会和生产实践这一方面是绝对必要的，但是强调这一方面绝不是为了抛弃前人和别人的实践经验，而是为了在两者之间建立起正确的关系来。
    有些人参加了劳动生产和社会实践，便认为只有自己的实践经验才是可靠的，而所有的历史知识和书本知识都是教条，都是不能相信的。他们从脱离生产和社会实践到参加了生产和社会实践，这是一个很大的进步；但是他们因此便认为可以不学习古人和别人的经验了，这就是错了。产生这种片面看法的原因，是他们机械地理解了“一切真知都是从直接经验发源”这一唯物主义原理，而没有看到自己的经验是来源于实践，前人和别人的经验也同样是来源于他们的实践活动，这种经验只是对我们来说才是一种间接的经验。世界上很多人并没有到过美洲，而是通过哥伦布和一切去过那里的人才知道它的存在，但是美洲的存在并不因为很多人没有到过那里而有所改变。我们没有看见过孔夫子，而是通过他的门生记录下来的
  “论语”等才知道他的确存在过，但是存在过孔夫子的事实并不因为我们没有看见过他而有所改变。
    实际上，由于种种条件的限制，一切知识都经过自己的直接经验来获得是不可能的，多数还是从间接经验中获得的。人类有记载的历史已有几千年，宇宙之大是无限的，世界上事物之多也是无限的，一个人的一生最多也只能直接经验其中极短暂的时间和极狭小的范围。科学文化的发展能达到今天这样的高峰，正是因为人们都在前人和别人经验的基础上来开始自己的实践活动。他们总结了前人和别人的经验，又经过亲身的实践把自己的经验加入到知识的宝库中去，成为后一代人的间接经验。人类知识正是如此一代代积累起来的。门德雷也夫是在前人和别人已经发现了六十余种元素的基础上发现了周期率的，周期率一旦发现就成了后一代人进一步探索物质内部规律的武器；但是要理解周期率并不一定要每一个人都亲自测定一下每一种元素的原子量。马克思在奠定马克思主义基础的时候，除了亲身参加当时的社会斗争实践之外，也不能不通过大量古今内外的文献、即通过间接的道路来总结人类知识的总和，而不可能直接经验由他的理论所概括的一切内容。
    因此，在一定意义上可以说，对间接知识的态度和看法的问题，实际上是一个对历史遗产、对书本知识的态度和看法的问题。
    历史经验基本上是属于间接知识的范围，因为除了现代史的一小部分外，我们都无法去直接经验它们。但是，我们绝不能因此轻视或抛弃历史的宝贵遗产。这些历史遗产之所以是重要的，就在于他是人类长期实践斗争中积累下来的经验，其中就包含着十分丰富的、经过证明了的“真知”。人类现在能达到的一切科学文化成就，都是在这个基础上发展起来的。没有古代的棍棒石块，就不会有今天的原子发电机；没有原始的弓箭，就不会有今天的宇宙火箭。人类如果像“狗熊偷玉米”那样，取得一个便丢掉原有的一个，那么我们也许至今仍会处在茹毛饮血的阶段。正因为如此，列宁说过：“无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会、官僚社会压迫下所创造出来的知识总汇发展的必然结果”。“只有用人类所创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。”毛泽东同志也说过：“今天的中国是历史的中国的一个发展；我们是马克思主义的历史主义者，我们不应当割断历史。从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，承继这一份珍贵的遗产。这对于指导当前的伟大的运动，是有重要的帮助的”。
    书本知识对我们来说大部分也是间接的知识，因为书本中包括着我们无法或没有经验过的大量的前人和别人经验的总结。我们也不能看不起书本的知识，因为好的书本知识比个人的直接经验来说包含着更多的内容，而且它是经过了一番加工提炼成为理性的东西。没有实践经验当然不会产生理论知识，但是，理论一旦产生出来就可以指导实践，给实践以明确的目标。当六十余种元素的内在联系没有找到的时候，我们对新元素的发现不能有任何的预见；但是当门德雷也夫发现了其内在联系、即发现了周期率后，他就预见到我们将要发现的一些新的元素，而且历史正是如他的预见那样实现了。
    当然，我们并不能因此得出结论说，有了间接的经验就够了，自己的直接经验是可有可无的。恰恰相反，我们认为人的直接经验仍然有其决定的意义，这不仅是因为不论是自己的还是前人和别人的经验都发源于直接的经验，而且是因为人的实践活动是改造自然和社会的主要条件。学习前人和别人的经验，不是为了钻到故纸堆中变成书呆子，而是为了用以指导我们的实践，并通过实践进一步发展我们的科学文化。因此，学了书本知识和历史知识还要拿来用（当然也不能都要求马上有用），使之与实际结合。
    并且，我们还不能认为一切的间接经验都是可靠的，可以不加选择地吸收。间接经验中那些经过检验和证明了的当然是可靠的知识，我们要认真地学习。但是，由于人的认识的限制和历史条件的限制，间接经验中也必然包含着一些不可靠的被歪曲了的东西。不过，我们也要认真地研究，然后才知道其不可靠。总之，对于间接经验，我们不能轻率地予以肯定或否定，而要认真地学习和研究它们，去其糟粕，取其精华，批判其错误的不可靠的东西，吸收其正确可靠的东西。
    由上可见，间接经验和直接经验，孤立地看都有其局限性。直接经验是人的知识的发源，但是在单个人的直接经验的基础上，是不可能达到知识的高峰的；间接知识是前人和别人的直接经验的东西，但是在我们没有认真学习研究以前还是别人的东西，并且其中的错误也不能发现。
    因此，我们必须既要学习间接的知识，又要有自己的直接知识；既要有书本知识和历史知识，又要有社会和生产的实践经验。这二者都是从实践的基础上产生，因而也只能在实践的基础上结合起来，统一起来。只有如此，我们才能获得丰富的全面的知识，才能促进科学文化的不断发展。
