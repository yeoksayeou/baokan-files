Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 13th: People's communes in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, based on the principle of unified leadership and management at different levels, have adopted various measures to fully utilize the role of production teams, resulting in a vigorous spring ploughing production.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of production teams, the county party committee and commune party committees have delegated a large number of cadres to work and participate in production in the production teams. Of the 622 cadres delegated at all levels in the county, more than 590 have arrived in the production teams. These cadres are able to work hard and deeply, setting an example in everything they do in the production teams. Some production teams that were relatively backward in their work have quickly improved and become advanced production teams after additional cadres were assigned. Each people's commune, in conjunction with rectification, has reorganized the production teams and established team committees. The team committee implements collective leadership, and divides responsibilities by line and area. Their slogan is: "Grasp everything when you go down, then divide the work when you come back up." This has further strengthened the leadership of the production teams. Each people's commune has defined the fixed cultivation areas of the production teams, and established a responsibility system of "two guarantees" (guaranteeing output and quality, guaranteeing investment) and "four fixings" (fixing the crop planting area, fixing labor, fixing measures, fixing rewards and punishments), as well as a field management responsibility system of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing the season, guaranteeing measures, guaranteeing quality) and "three diligences" (diligent inspection, diligent supervision, diligent feedback).

    After taking the above measures, the cadres and members of each production team are even more enthusiastic, and the labor competition is in full swing. More than 40,000 mu of seedbeds in the county have been prepared, fertilized, plowed, and harrowed; the selection, drying, and disinfection of seeds are being carried out intensively.

    Hainan Island Organizes Operation Groups to Improve Rice Transplanting Efficiency

    According to the Southern Daily, people's communes in various parts of the Hainan area of Guangdong Province are generally improving labor organization and organizing large numbers of rice transplanting groups, seedling pulling groups, fertilizer delivery groups, and field harrowing groups of three to five or five to seven people, which has generally improved labor efficiency.

    According to statistics from 85 communes in eight counties and cities, including Wenchang, Chengmai, Yaxian, and Haikou, there are already 32,863 specialized teams and specialized groups for rice transplanting, seedling pulling, fertilizer delivery, and plowing. These operation groups are promoting the "six fixings, one reward, and one competition" labor responsibility system and a management system of assigning measures to the fields and responsibilities to individuals. Labor efficiency has generally increased by about 50%, the progress of rice transplanting has accelerated by 42%, and the quality of rice transplanting has also greatly improved. After Ledong County improved labor organization and organized 8,040 rice transplanting operation groups, the daily progress of rice transplanting increased from 2,000 mu to 2,800 mu. By February 25, 80% of the basic farmland in the county had completed rice transplanting. The improvement in labor efficiency is even more significant in communes that have implemented the "six fixings, one reward, and one competition" system. For example, 115 rice transplanting operation groups in Yunlong Commune in the suburbs of Haikou City implemented a "six fixings" system that fixes time, tasks, quality (specifications of one by five), plots, labor, and leadership. Labor efficiency has nearly doubled; the commune has increased from transplanting 220 mu per day to 500 mu.

    Fuzhou Prefecture Launches a Red Flag Competition for Double Thousand Jin Per Mu Yield

    According to the Jiangxi Daily, a ten-red-flag competition movement for double thousand jin per mu yield of early rice, with the commune as the unit, is developing vigorously in Fuzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province. The 110 people's communes in the prefecture have put forward competition conditions, determined to achieve an average yield of 1,300 jin per mu for early rice this year, and obtain 3.2 billion jin of grain in one season for the whole prefecture, laying a solid foundation for achieving the plan of 5.2 billion jin of total grain production for the whole year (an increase of 72% over 1958).

    The early rice double thousand jin per mu yield ten red flag competition movement was proposed at the enlarged meeting of the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held from February 21 to 28. The meeting believed that in order to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, in addition to the preparatory work for spring plowing such as accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, and deep winter plowing in the previous period, which were grasped earlier, more carefully, and better than in the same period last year, it is also required to make persistent efforts in the future to plan fields mu by mu, and commune by commune, ensuring that early rice eliminates water and drought disasters, and that each mound has sufficient water sources; each mu is fertilized with 500 dan of fertilizer and 500 jin of native fertilizer; spring plowing is advanced, and deep plowing and careful harrowing are carried out to ensure that there are no weeds on the ridges and embankments, the mud is as rotten as pulp, and the fields are as flat as mirrors; and it is required to complete the early rice sowing task before March 20. In addition, the prefectural committee also decided to launch a ten red flag competition for double thousand jin per mu yield of early rice in the whole prefecture, with the commune as the unit. Now, the competition movement is being carried out extensively and deeply in the whole prefecture, with more than 300,000 people participating in accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects alone.

    Baise County Completes Early Rice Sowing One Season in Advance

    According to the Guangxi Daily, Baise County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had successfully completed the early rice sowing task by the beginning of March, one season earlier than in previous years. This year, a total of 1,920,254 mu of early rice was sown in the county, and the vast majority reached new technical specifications, firing the first shot for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    The reason why the county's early rice sowing work was completed so quickly and well is mainly because the guiding ideology was clear. Before the Beginning of Spring, the county party committee mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses by using the fact that most of the early sowing last year yielded a bumper harvest, and some did not increase production because they missed the season due to late sowing. At the same time, party committees at all levels also personally went deep into the fields to strengthen supervision and inspection, and carried out experimental fields to drive the overall situation. In addition, a responsibility system was established. Some communes adopted the method of six fixings, namely, fixing the leadership, fixing the labor force, fixing the farming location and task, fixing the specification and quality, fixing the time requirements, and fixing the farming cattle and farm tools. At the same time, labor management was carefully carried out, and labor competitions were launched to promote each other. This promoted the rapid and good development of the sowing work.

    At present, on the basis of completing sowing, the county is turning to a blitz of early rice field preparation, striving to complete the early rice transplanting task in advance.

    Huangyan Promotes the "Seven Fairies" Fast Rice Transplanting Experience

    This newspaper reports that Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, is recently using various forms to widely publicize and promote the "Seven Fairies" fast rice transplanting experience, and is also running various training classes to train rice transplanters and farm tool operators. This is an important measure taken by Huangyan County to greatly improve labor productivity and successfully overcome the spring ploughing and rice transplanting hurdle.

    The "Seven Fairies" refer to He Fengying, Xu Meixiang, Wang Xianfeng, Wang Meiyun, Yang Lingfeng, He Jinfeng, and Pan Xianzhao, seven female commune members of the Jiazhi Management Area of the Haimen People's Commune in the county. Most of them are young women around the age of twenty who became famous for their fast rice transplanting last year. According to measurements, last year they could transplant 60,000 to 70,000 clumps to 90,000 clumps per person per day, that is, one to one and a half mu per day according to the 5×2 specification for dense planting. According to a survey, the rice transplanting speed in various parts of Zhejiang Province last year could only reach 30,000 clumps per person per day at the higher end, 15,000 to 20,000 clumps in the middle, and only 6,000 to 7,000 clumps at the lowest. Compared with the higher level, the "Seven Fairies" are one to two times higher. The Huangyan County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the emergence of the "Seven Fairies." In order to achieve a doubling of agricultural labor productivity, it is actively publicizing and promoting their fast rice transplanting experience. The Zhejiang Daily also used the entire front page on the 7th to give prominent publicity and published an editorial entitled "Learn from the 'Seven Fairies'," calling on all localities to vigorously promote the "Seven Fairies" and the fast rice transplanting methods created by various localities while promoting rice transplanters, and strive to complete the transplanting task successfully in a short period of time.

    Spring is returning to the earth, and another rice transplanting season is coming. Responding actively to the call of the Party, the "Seven Fairies" are diligently studying and practicing to further improve their skills and strive to make even more outstanding achievements this year. Before the "March 8th" festival, they issued a battle invitation to the women sisters in the Wenzhou Prefecture, proposing to carry out a friendship competition. In their competition conditions, they proposed to strive to transplant 120,000 clumps per person per day this year, that is, transplant more than two mu of dense planting seedlings. Their proposal has been warmly responded to by female generals from various commune management areas in Huangyan, Linhai, Ruian and other counties. A competition movement to learn from the "Seven Fairies" and surpass the "Seven Fairies" has been launched among the vast number of women.

    Wanchun Commune Skillfully Arranges Labor and Sows Fine Seeds in Batches

    According to the Sichuan Daily, Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, has recently arranged a plan for batch harvesting of small spring crops and batch transplanting of large spring crops according to the growing seasons of small and large spring crops, so that all production links are closely linked and carried out in an orderly manner. This not only solves the problem of labor crowding, but also ensures that the farming season is not missed.

    This year, the small spring crops in Wanchun Commune have generally implemented a high degree of dense planting, and the 80,000 mu of rice to be planted will also promote dense planting. The amount of labor will increase significantly. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage, in addition to building wheat harvesters and rice transplanters, the commune has also decided to adjust labor from rationally arranging the harvesting and planting of small and large spring crops. After discussions among the commune cadres, the commune party committee, based on the opinions of the masses, decided to calculate the connection time according to the harvesting and transplanting seasons of various crops, and then arrange labor to sow and transplant in batches. It was determined that the sowing would basically be completed in three batches.

    In order to effectively guarantee the implementation of the three-batch sowing plan, each brigade in the commune has assigned field management responsibilities to individuals. The managers will strictly check and accept the quality of land preparation, the amount of fertilizer applied, the sowing time, and the sowing specifications in accordance with the regulations for each batch of sowing.

    Shuangxing Brigade Overcomes Wind and Rain to Preserve Seedlings

    According to the Fujian Daily, Shuangxing Brigade of Suocuo Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, everyone contributed their efforts and ideas, overcame more than 20 days of cold wind and rain and drastically changing cold and hot weather, protected the healthy growth of seedlings in more than 1,700 mu of seedbeds and direct seeding fields in the whole team, and cultivated enough strong seedlings for early rice dense planting.

    In order to achieve the plan of 1,500 jin per mu of early rice, Shuangxing Brigade started sowing on February 16, one season earlier than last year. At present, it has completed more than 700 mu of seedbed sowing and 1,000 mu of direct seeding tasks. However, since sowing, there has been continuous spring rain and drastically changing cold and hot weather. Based on these circumstances, the brigade party branch convened a meeting of cadres, a forum for old farmers, and a mass meeting, calling on everyone to contribute ideas to cultivate strong seedlings. At the same time, a on-site meeting was convened to mobilize the masses to protect the seedlings. Responding to the call of the party branch, the commune members tried every means to cultivate strong seedlings.

    Thanks to the many good experiences contributed by the masses, coupled with the fact that the cadres, party members, and league members took the lead in fighting in the fields day and night, Shuangxing Brigade finally safely survived more than 20 days of adverse weather with more than 1,700 mu of seedbeds and direct seeding fields. Now the first batch of sown seedlings has grown to more than three inches long and can be transplanted recently. The second and third batches of sown seedlings have also sprouted and taken root, with strong roots and dense and verdant mounds. (Attached picture)

    南方各地人民公社掀起春耕生产高潮
    播良种　育壮秧　力争早稻丰产
    临湘县充分发挥生产队的积极性
    新华社长沙13日电　湖南临湘县各公社根据统一领导分级管理的原则，采取各种措施，充分发挥生产队的作用，春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    为了加强生产队的领导力量，县委和公社党委下放了大批干部到生产队中工作和参加生产。在全县各级下放的六百二十二名干部中，已有五百九十多名到了生产队。这些干部都能艰苦深入，在生产队里处处以身作则，起模范带头作用。一些原来工作比较落后的生产队，加派干部后，工作很快有了起色，变成了先进生产队。各人民公社结合整社，整顿了生产队，成立了队委会。队委会实行集体领导，又分线分片包干。他们的口号是：下去一把抓，上来再分家。这样，就进一步加强了生产队的领导。各人民公社都确定了生产队的固定的耕作区域，并且建立两包（包产量和质量、包投资）四定（定作物种植面积、定劳力、定措施、定奖罚）的责任制，以及三保（保季节、保措施、保质量）三勤（勤检查、勤督促、勤反映）的田间管理责任制。
    采取上述措施以后，各生产队干部和社员的干劲更足了，劳动竞赛轰轰烈烈地开展起来。全县四万多亩秧田已经进行了整地、下肥和犁耙；种子的精选、翻晒、消毒工作正在紧张进行。
    海南岛组织作业小组提高插秧效率
    据南方日报消息　广东省海南区各地人民公社，普遍改善劳动组织，大量组织起三至五人或五至七人的插秧组、拔秧组、送肥组、耙田组等，使劳动效率普遍提高。
    根据文昌、澄迈、崖县、海口等八个县市的八十五个公社统计，已经组织起来的插秧、拔秧、送肥、犁耙田等专业队、专业小组共有三万二千八百六十三个。这些作业小组正在推行“六定一奖一赛”的劳动责任制和措施到田、责任到人的管理制度，劳动效率一般提高了50％左右，插秧的进度加速了42％，插秧的质量也比前大有提高。乐东县改善劳动组织，组织了八千零四十个插秧作业小组以后，每天插秧进度由二千亩提高到二千八百亩。到2月25日，全县80％的基本农田就完成插秧。推行了“六定一奖一赛”制度的公社，劳动效率的提高更为显著。例如海口市郊云龙公社的一百一十五个插秧作业小组，实行了定时间、定任务、定质量（规格一乘五）、定地段、定劳动力、定领导的“六定”制度，劳动效率将近提高一倍；全社由原来日插二百二十亩增加到五百亩。
    抚州专区开展亩产双千斤红旗竞赛
    据江西日报消息　一个以公社为单位的早稻亩产双千斤的十面红旗竞赛运动，正以万马奔腾之势，在江西省抚州专区普遍开展。全区一百一十个人民公社纷纷提出竞赛条件，决心争取今年早稻达到平均亩产一千三百斤，全区一季拿到三十二亿斤粮食，为实现全年粮食总产五十二亿斤（比1958年增长72％）的计划打下雄厚的基础。
    开展早稻亩产双千斤十面红旗竞赛运动，是2月21日至28日召开的中共抚州地委扩大会议提出的倡议。会议认为，为了确保实现早稻大丰收，除了前一时期积肥造肥、兴修水利、深翻冬翻等项春耕准备工作，都比去年同时期抓得早，抓得细，抓得好以外，还要求今后再接再厉，作好逐县、逐社、逐队规划好田亩，保证早稻消灭水旱灾害，丘丘水源充足；亩亩下肥五百担，土化肥五百斤；提前春耕，深耕细耙，作到田塍、田塝无杂草，泥烂如浆，田平如镜；以及要求在3月20日以前完成早稻播种任务等。此外，地委还决定在全区范围内开展以公社为单位的早稻亩产双千斤十面红旗竞赛。现在，竞赛运动正向全区广泛深入地开展，仅参加积肥造肥和兴修水利的就有三十多万人。
    百色县提早一个季节完成早稻播种
    据广西日报消息　广西僮族自治区百色县到3月初已胜利完成了早稻播种任务，比往年提早了一个季节，全县今年共播种早稻一百九十二万零二百五十四亩，绝大部分达到新的技术规格，为实现今年农业生产更大跃进打响了第一炮。
    该县的早稻播种工作所以如此又快又好地完成任务，主要是由于指导思想明确，县委在立春前就在全体干部和群众中用去年大部分早播得到丰收，部分因迟播错过了季节因而得不到增产的事实，把干部和群众的积极性调动起来。在这同时，各级党委还亲自深入田间，加强督促检查，并搞好试验田，带动全面。此外还建立责任制，有些公社采用了六固定的办法，即定领导，定劳动力，定耕作地点和任务，定规格质量，定时间要求，定耕牛农具。同时认真搞好劳动管理，开展劳动竞赛，互相推动。这就促进了播种工作既快又好的开展。
    目前该县正在完成播种的基础上，转入突击早稻本田整理，争取提早完成早稻插秧任务。
    黄岩推广“七仙女”快速插秧经验
    本报讯　浙江省黄岩县最近正在通过各种形式，广泛宣传推广“七仙女”的快速插秧经验，同时大办各种训练班来培养插秧手和农具手。这是黄岩县大大提高劳动生产率，胜利攻克春耕插秧这一关的一项重要措施。
      “七仙女”是指该县海门人民公社葭芷管理区的贺凤英、许梅香、王仙凤、王美云、杨领凤、何金凤和潘仙招等七位女社员，她们大多数是二十岁上下的青年妇女，在去年水稻插秧中以插秧快速而出名。据测定，去年她们每天每人能插秧六、七万丛到九万丛，即按5×2规格密植每天插一亩到一亩半。而根据调查，去年浙江全省各地水稻的插秧速度，较高的每天每人只能达到三万丛，中等的插一万五千到二万丛，最低的只能插六、七千丛。与较高的水平相比，“七仙女”也高出一倍到两倍。中共黄岩县委对“七仙女”的涌现非常重视，为了实现成倍地提高农业劳动生产率，正积极宣传推广她们的快速插秧经验。浙江日报7日也用第一版整版地位作了突出的宣传，并发表题为“向‘七仙女’看齐”的社论，号召各地在推广插秧机的同时，也大力推广“七仙女”和各地创造的快速插秧法，争取用较短的时间，胜利完成插秧任务。
    大地春回，又一个插秧的季节即将来临。“七仙女”积极响应党的号召，正勤学苦练，进一步提高技术，争取今年做出更出色的成绩。她们在“三八”节前夕，曾向温州专区的妇女姐妹们发出战表，倡议开展友谊竞赛。在她们的竞赛条件中，提出要在今年力争每人每天插秧十二万丛，即插密植秧二亩以上。她们的倡议已经得到黄岩、临海、瑞安等县许多公社管理区的各路女将们的热烈响应，广大妇女已掀起了一个学“七仙女”超“七仙女”的竞赛运动。
    万春公社劳力巧安排分批播良种
    据四川日报消息　四川省温江县万春人民公社，最近根据大小春生长季节，及早安排好了分批收割小春和分批栽插大春的计划，使各个生产环节紧密相连，有次序地进行。这样做，既解决了劳力打挤问题，又保证不误农时。
    万春公社今年的小春作物普遍实行了高度密植，将要种植的八万亩水稻也要推行密植，用工量将显著增多，为了解决劳力紧张问题，社里除正在大造小麦收割机、水稻插秧机等工具外，还决定从合理安排大小春收栽农活上来调剂劳力。经过社干部的讨论，公社党委根据群众意见，决定按各种作物的收割和栽插季节，计算出衔接时间，然后安排劳力，分批播种，分批栽插。确定基本上分三批播完种。
    为了切实保证实现三批播种计划，全社各个大队都把田块管理责任分配到人，管理人将严格按照各批播种的规定，检查验收整地质量、施肥数量、播种时间和播种规格。
    双星大队战胜风雨保全秧苗
    据福建日报消息　福建省晋江县苏厝公社双星大队人人出力献计，战胜了二十多天冷风雨和冷热剧变的坏气候，保护全队一千七百多亩秧苗和直播田的秧苗生长茁壮，为早稻密植育足了壮秧。
    双星大队为了实现早稻亩产一千五百斤的规划，比去年提前一个季节，在2月16日就开始播种，目前已完成七百多亩秧田播种和一千亩水直播任务。但自播种以来一直春雨绵绵，冷热多变。大队党支部根据这些情况，召开了干部会、老农座谈会和群众大会，号召人人献计，培育壮秧，同时召开现场会议，动员群众护好秧苗。社员们响应党支部的号召，千方百计培育壮秧。
    由于有了群众贡献出来的许多好经验，加上干部党团员们不分昼夜地带头奋战田间，终于使双星大队的一千七百多亩秧田和直播田，安全度过了二十多天恶劣气候。现在第一批播种的秧苗已长到三寸多长，最近就可插秧。第二三批播种的秧苗也已抽青扎根，根株茁壮，丘丘茂密翠绿。（附图片）
