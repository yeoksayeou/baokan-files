Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 6th - In order to meet the great leap forward in national construction and the huge demand for timber, forest railways are now being built in the virgin forest area of the Greater Khingan Range.

Currently, more than 20,000 railway construction workers are advancing into the primeval dense forests along the four forest railway lines, which are over 300 kilometers long, opening up steep mountains and undeveloped frozen soil.

Three of these four railways are branch lines extending from the original Yalin Railway into the newly developed virgin forest, and the other is the Nenlin Line extending from Nenjiang Station, north of Qiqihar, to the eastern foot of the Greater Khingan Range. After the Nenlin Railway is completed, large quantities of timber can be transported southward from Nenjiang Station, via the Pingqi Line, to Liaoning and other parts of Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall), reducing the burden on the Binzhou Railway.

These four railways started construction successively in August and September of last year. In previous years, railway construction in the Greater Khingan Range only started on a large scale after the frozen soil thawed in April and May. However, the winter in the Greater Khingan Range is very long, and the progress of the project was very slow due to the winter shutdown. During the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to speed up the project's progress, the workers launched a major debate on the issue of whether large-scale construction could be carried out in winter. After the debate, the workers broke the superstition that large-scale construction could not be carried out in winter. They also came up with many methods for winter construction, wore cold-proof equipment, and launched a battle for time in the severe cold. They mined stone on a large scale because it was advantageous to mine stone in winter; when the rivers froze in winter, they used the freezing method to build the foundations of bridges. The use of the freezing method also saved a lot of water pump equipment compared to summer operations.

### 把铁路修进原始森林  大兴安岭两万多职工冒着严寒加紧施工

    把铁路修进原始森林
    大兴安岭两万多职工冒着严寒加紧施工
    新华社牙克石6日电　大兴安岭原始森林区目前正在加紧兴建森林铁路，以适应国家建设大跃进对木材的大量需要。
    现在，两万多名筑路职工正在三百多公里长的四条森林铁路线路上，开峻岭、辟冻土，向原始密林里挺进。
    这四条铁路，有三条是从原有的牙林铁路向新开发的原始林延伸的支线，另一条是从齐齐哈尔北边的嫩江车站向大兴安岭东麓伸进的嫩林线。嫩林线铁路建成以后，大批木材可从嫩江站南下，通过平齐线运往辽宁和关内各地，减轻滨洲线铁路的负担。
    这四条铁路是去年8、9月份先后动工兴建的。往年，在大兴安岭修建铁路都是在4、5月间冻土解冻之后才开始大规模施工。但是，大兴安岭冬季很长，冬天一停工，工程进度就很慢了。去年大跃进中，职工们为了加快工程进度，就冬季能否大规模施工的问题，展开了大辩论。经过辩论，职工们打破冬季不能大规模施工的迷信。并且想出许多冬季施工的办法，穿着防寒装备，在严寒里展开了争夺时间的战斗，冬季开石方有利，他们就大量开石方；冬天河水冻结了，他们就运用冻结法修建桥梁的基础。使用冻结法，还比夏季作业节省了不少抽水机设备。
