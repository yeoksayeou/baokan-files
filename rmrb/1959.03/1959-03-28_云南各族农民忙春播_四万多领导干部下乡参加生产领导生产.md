    This newspaper, Kunming, 27th: In the thousands of mountains and valleys of the Yunnan Plateau, over four million farmers of all ethnic groups have begun plowing, sowing, and transplanting rice seedlings on the vast fields stretching from the banks of the Jinsha River in the east to the Hengduan Mountains in the west. Along the thousand-mile border of Yunnan, located in the subtropical zone, the early rice seedlings planted by the Dai farmers have begun to turn green, presenting a lush, green landscape everywhere.

    In Yunnan Province, sowing and transplanting are starting earlier and progressing faster than in previous years. Currently, the over 46,000 mu of early rice sown across the province are growing densely and sturdily, and the over 300,000 mu of cotton and nearly 100,000 mu of sugarcane are also growing vigorously.

    Since the beginning of spring, more than 45,000 leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government have gone to the countryside and communes to lead production through participation in production, greatly encouraging the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups. Wang Zixian, First Secretary of the Zhaotong Prefectural Party Committee, worked alongside commune members to accumulate fertilizer in the face of the heaviest snowfall and coldest weather Yunnan had seen in decades; the county's attendance rate regularly exceeded 90%. In the Ninglang Yi ethnic group settlement, which formerly had a slave system economy, Party and government officials led 300 cadres to villages and patiently helped the Yi brothers, who had just been freed from the shackles of slavery, to farm during the first spring after peaceful consultation and land reform. Although the Yi farmers were not familiar with rice cultivation techniques, the management of the rice paddies this year is as good as that of farmers in the interior.

    A feature of this year's agricultural production in Yunnan Province is that while focusing on grain production, it also does not neglect various cash crops. During the period of preparation for farming, fertilizer accumulation formed a massive mass movement across various regions. Recent preliminary statistics show that the province has accumulated over 700 billion jin of fertilizer, of which human and animal manure accounts for about 35% of the total, and soil fertilizer accounts for more than 3%, both in quantity and quality exceeding last year. The province has also done better than in previous years in terms of plowing and water conservancy. The winter plowing fields that should be plowed in the province have basically been plowed, of which about one-fifth have been deeply plowed more than one chi deep, and the land in the border minority areas has also been plowed deeper than in previous years. This year's water conservancy work started early, and the quality of the projects is good. Last year, an average of less than six fang of water was conserved for every fang of earthwork done, while this year twelve point six fang of water were conserved for every fang of earthwork. Now, the water conservancy projects built throughout the province, coupled with the supplementary measures of well-digging and increasing irrigation and drainage machinery, can basically solve the water needs of the province's large and small spring crops this year. In addition, various regions have exchanged seeds that are most suitable for local growth based on local climate, soil, and other natural conditions, and vigorously promoted rational close planting.

    云南各族农民忙春播
    四万多领导干部下乡参加生产领导生产
    本报昆明27日电　云南高原的千山万壑之中，四百多万各族农民在东起金沙江畔西至横断山脉的广阔田野上，已开始犁田、撒种和插秧。地处亚热带的云南边疆千余里国境线上，傣族农民播下的早稻秧已开始转青，到处一片油绿。
    云南省今年撒种插秧都较往年提早，插秧进度也快。目前，全省播种的四万六千多亩早稻长得茂密茁壮，三十多万亩棉花和近十万亩甘蔗也生长旺盛。
    入春以来，各级党政领导干部四万五千多人，纷纷下乡下社，通过参加生产来领导生产，大大鼓舞了各族人民的革命干劲。昭通地委第一书记王子贤，在云南数十年未有的大雪寒天里，和社员一道顶着雪花积肥；这个县的出勤率经常在90％以上。原是奴隶制经济结构的宁蒗彝族聚居区，在和平协商土改后的第一个春天，党政负责干部率领三百多干部下村寨，耐心帮助刚刚挣脱奴隶锁链的伊族兄弟种田，虽然彝族农民不熟悉种植水稻的技术，但今年秧田管理得和内地农民一样好。
    云南省今年农业生产上一个特点是，既抓紧粮食生产，也不放松各种经济作物。在备耕期间，各地积肥形成声势浩大的群众运动。最近初步统计，全省已积肥七千多亿斤，其中，人畜粪肥为总数的35％左右，土化肥占3％以上，数量质量都超过去年。全省在翻耕和水利方面，也比往年做得好。全省应翻耕的冬耕田基本翻耕完毕，其中有五分之一左右深翻一尺以上，边疆少数民族地区土地也较往年翻得深。今年的水利工作，动手早，工程质量好。去年，平均修一方土不到六方水，今年修一方土却有十二点六方水。现在，全省兴修的水利，再加上打井、增加排灌机械等补助措施，基本上能解决今年全省大小春作物用水。此外，各地根据当地气候，土壤等自然条件，调换了当地最适宜生长的种籽，大力推广合理密植。
