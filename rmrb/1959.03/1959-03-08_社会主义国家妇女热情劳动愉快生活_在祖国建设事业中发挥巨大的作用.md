Comprehensive report: As International Women's Day approaches, women in socialist countries are celebrating their holiday with unprecedented political and labor enthusiasm, striving for new and greater achievements.

    Soviet Union
    Soviet women are celebrating their holiday with new labor achievements. In the vast countryside, in many factories, women on all production fronts are organizing communist labor teams, working hard, and actively striving to better complete the Seven-Year Plan.
    The Moscow "Three Mountains" Textile Factory, the First and Second Clock Factory, and the Pharmaceutical Factory are all filled with a festive atmosphere these days. 80%-90% of the workers there are women. Dozens of work groups in these factories, striving for the title of Communist Labor Team, are engaged in production competitions. In the past two days, many female workers in the textile and pharmaceutical factories have completed 120%-200% of their workload every day.
    Today, Soviet women with higher education account for half of the experts in various sectors of the Soviet national economy. There are 93,000 different experts in scientific work alone. In industry, there are about 500,000 female engineers and technicians. Many women have become factory directors, workshop directors, and team leaders. In rural areas, women's labor is particularly important. Many of them are outstanding agronomists, farm chairpersons, and tractor drivers. In education, women account for 70%, and in medicine, women account for 75%.
    Soviet women are becoming increasingly active in socio-political activities. Like men, they participate in the management of national affairs. More than 2,000 women across the Soviet Union are representatives to the Supreme Soviet and the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics. 37% of the representatives to local Soviets are women, totaling more than 500,000. In the Soviet Union, many women hold important positions such as ministers and deputy ministers. Albania
    In the fourteen years since Albania's liberation, the ranks of women's labor force have been expanding year by year. Today, the number of women participating in production has increased forty-seven times compared to 1938. Currently, women working in the education sector account for 42% of all staff, and as much as 60% in the health sector. Even in the complex industrial production sector, women account for 23%.
    In this newborn labor force, many outstanding women have emerged. More than 1,300 have won the title of Stakhanovite worker, more than 4,500 have won the title of shock worker, and more than 3,300 women have won various medals and awards.
    Under the people's regime, Albanian women actively participate in management work. There are more than 1,600 women who are people's representatives at all levels. Seventeen women are representatives to the National People's Assembly, and six hundred and fifty-eight women serve as judges or jurors in the people's courts.
    Before liberation, 94% of women in Albania were illiterate. But today, one in every three women in the country is studying in various schools. Women under the age of forty had already shed the label of illiteracy by 1955. In 1938, there were no female engineers in Albania, but now there are 459 female engineers and technicians.
    To welcome the "March 8th" Festival, Albanian women are responding to the call of the International Women's Federation and launching a nationwide campaign against the use of nuclear weapons.
    Mongolia
    Mongolian women have become a strong force on all fronts of socialist construction.
    Currently, 50% of the strong labor force in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives and farms are women. Women account for 41% of the total number of workers in the country. They have learned and mastered science and technology. Female advanced producers continue to emerge. Tractor driver Daolema reclaimed 1,300 hectares of wasteland in one year, and milkmaid Avermid can produce 2,000 liters of milk per cow. Their model deeds have become examples for workers to learn from.
    The proportion of female staff in cultural, educational, and health departments is even larger. Women account for 70% of the medical staff, 32% of the artists, and 25% of the teachers in the country. Women are also active participants in political and social activities. Currently, women representatives account for 21% of the total number of representatives in the Mongolian Great People's Hural.
    Under the care of the Mongolian Party and government, women's and children's welfare has also developed significantly. Mothers with many children are rewarded by the state, and more than 23,000 mothers across the country have received the "Glorious Mother" medal.
    Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovak women actively participate in the socialist construction of their motherland. Currently, more than 42% of the employees in the entire national economy are women, an increase of more than 40% compared to 1946. In the industrial sector, women account for 36% of the workforce. In agricultural production, women account for 54% of the labor force, while in health, education, trade, and other departments, female staff even account for more than 60% to 70%.
    In rural areas, many women serve as chairpersons and other leading positions in agricultural cooperatives, becoming the backbone of the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production.
    Women are also active members of the state's political and social life. Currently, there are sixty-two female members in the National Assembly. There are more than 30,000 female cadres in people's committees at all levels across the country, accounting for 17% of the total number of members.
    Since liberation, especially since 1950, the Czechoslovak Party and government have vigorously developed service industries and public utilities to liberate the female labor force burdened by housework. Currently, Czechoslovakia has more than 1,000 well-equipped nurseries and more than 6,000 kindergartens.
    Romania
    Romanian women, who account for more than half of the country's population, play a huge role in the socialist construction of their motherland. Women are an important force on the industrial front. Women working in light industry, the food industry, and the trade system account for 70% of the total number of employees, and more than eighty of them hold leadership positions in factories and enterprises.
    In agricultural production, women are also actively contributing their strength. Many women serve as farm chairpersons or directors of agricultural cooperatives.
    Before liberation, women accounted for 70% of the country's four million illiterate and semi-literate people. Now, girls account for 48% of the students in seven-year schools, and girls account for more than 37% in universities. Many female scientists, female writers, female poets, and female artists have emerged in the country.
    Women also actively participate in the country's political life. More than 30,000 women across the country have been elected as representatives to the Grand National Assembly and people's congresses at all levels. Many women also serve as presidents and jurors in the courts. More than 7,000 women across the country have received medals or awards issued by the state. (Attached pictures)
