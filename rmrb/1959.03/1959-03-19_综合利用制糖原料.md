Comprehensive Utilization of Sugar Production Materials
Luo Shuzhang, Vice Minister of Light Industry

Sugar cane is a treasure trove; it can directly and indirectly produce food, clothing, and daily necessities for people, and can also provide chemical raw materials and agricultural fertilizers. In recent years, China's sugar industry has developed rapidly, but not enough attention has been paid to the comprehensive utilization of sugar materials, and many valuable by-products have been discarded as waste.

It is estimated that two-thirds of China's sugar production uses sugar cane as raw material. If China uses 40 million tons of sugar cane as raw material each year, turning the bagasse into paper and furfural, and using all the molasses and filter mud to produce alcohol and cane wax, it can produce more than 2 million tons of various types of paper, more than 100,000 tons of furfural, nearly 300,000 tons of alcohol, and more than 10,000 tons of cane wax. These are all items urgently needed for national economic construction. In fact, many things can be produced using by-products from sugar cane factories, such as rayon, acetone butanol, citric acid, glycerin, dry ice, lactic acid, and dozens of others. If these products are further processed, thousands upon thousands of products can be made. The viscose fiber and furfural made from bagasse of 40 million tons of sugar cane can make 800,000 tons of rayon and 200,000 tons of nylon, which can weave more than 6 billion meters of cloth, averaging more than two zhang per person nationwide. It can be seen that the comprehensive utilization of sugar cane has great significance.

Sugar factories have many favorable conditions for carrying out comprehensive utilization on a large scale. First, the resources are abundant, and the raw materials are in the factory itself. Secondly, sugar factories have seasonal production, and many equipments can be utilized. Generally, sugar factories have some assets and great potential. Although the technical equipment of each industrial system has its particularities, it also has its commonalities. For example, of the fifteen units of chemical equipment, sugar factories have thirteen. The Neijiang Sanyuan Sugar Factory only added equipment such as hydrolysis pots and decolorization tanks, and was transformed from a sugar factory into a glucose factory with an annual output of 2,000 tons.

Furthermore, building factories within factories, and old factories building new factories, does not require setting up separate stalls, which can reduce non-productive investment and greatly save cadres.

In recent years, various places have explored some experiences in the comprehensive utilization of sugar cane, and many products have begun to be produced in workshops or factories. These are all favorable conditions for carrying out comprehensive utilization of sugar cane on a large scale in the future. Let us launch the comprehensive utilization movement vigorously.

The current policy for comprehensive utilization of sugar materials is: to accelerate the development of sugar production as the main task, vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of sugar materials, and make full use of sugar material resources.

In order to enable comprehensive utilization to be widely and deeply carried out in all sugar-producing areas, the following issues must be paid attention to:

1.  Launch a mass movement on a large scale. Facts show that the process of carrying out comprehensive utilization of sugar cane is also a process of intense ideological struggle. This struggle is first reflected in whether the comprehensive utilization of sugar cane should take the expert route of relying on a few people in a cold and lackluster manner, or the mass line of relying on the majority of people in a vigorous and enthusiastic manner. Taking the former route will certainly not achieve the expected results. Only by putting politics in command, launching a mass movement on a large scale, continuing to break superstitions, fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, relying on our own efforts, and overcoming difficulties can the cause of comprehensive utilization of sugar materials be vigorously developed. The most fundamental experience of why Neijiang Special District in Sichuan Province has done a good job in the comprehensive utilization of sugar cane is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and take the mass line.

2.  Combine indigenous and foreign methods, combine large, medium, and small sizes. Foreign production methods require less labor, have lower labor intensity, and the product quality is more guaranteed. Those with conditions can adopt foreign production methods. However, at present, under the situation of comprehensively advancing with steel as the key, it is impossible to have more steel and mechanical equipment to meet the development of light industry. Therefore, when starting to engage in the comprehensive utilization of sugar materials, the source of the required equipment must be carefully considered. If equipment is insufficient, we should take the road of: indigenous methods first, and combine indigenous and foreign methods.

China has a large number of medium and small sugar factories. In the future, the development of sugar factory construction will still focus on medium and small-sized factories for a certain period. Therefore, in terms of comprehensive utilization, more small workshops or sections should also be set up.

3.  The scope, priority, urgency and importance of comprehensive utilization of sugar materials. Starting from sugar, going on in a series, thousands of products can be produced. Taking bagasse as an example, carefully selected bagasse can be used for papermaking; screened bagasse can be used to make furfural, furfural can be used to make nylon 66, polyester resin, plastics, etc., polyester resin can be used as fiberglass, and nylon can be used as cords for airplane tires, clothing and other daily necessities.

There are many types of comprehensive utilization products of sugar materials. What should be grasped first? What should be grasped later? Which is the main one? Which is secondary? This is a question worth studying. When mobilizing the masses to engage in the comprehensive utilization of sugar materials on a large scale, it is not appropriate to draw frameworks first, so as not to affect the enthusiasm of the masses. However, after the masses have been mobilized and have mastered the relevant information on needs and possibilities, the priority, urgency and importance should be clarified. It is not right to only engage in high-end products in pursuit of output value and profit, and not be willing to engage in urgently needed general products, or to engage in them on a large scale before the technology has reached a certain degree of maturity. All localities should make plans based on the spirit of "the whole country is a chessboard" and then based on their own conditions, and use their strength in the most urgent places. Paper, cardboard, and alcohol are all urgently needed at present, and the more production the better; furfural, acetone butanol, citric acid, glycerin, etc. can all be developed more. In short, it is necessary to grasp the main products that are currently urgently needed. Of course, this does not mean that secondary products can be ignored. As long as secondary products have a way out and the technical and equipment conditions are available, they can also be produced.

    综合利用制糖原料
    轻工业部副部长　罗叔章
    甘蔗浑身是宝，它可以直接间接生产人们吃的、穿的，用的生活用品，还可以提供化工原料和农用肥料。几年来，我国制糖工业获得了迅速的发展，可是，糖料资源的综合利用却注意得不够，许多宝贵的副产物却被当作废料抛弃了。
    我国的食糖生产，估计有三分之二是以甘蔗为原料的，如果，我国每年用四千万吨甘蔗作原料的话，把这批甘蔗的蔗渣制成纸和糠醛，用全部废蜜和滤泥生产酒精和蔗腊，就可以生产各种纸张二百多万吨、糠醛十万余吨、酒精近三十万吨、蔗腊一万几千吨。这些都是当前国家经济建设中极需的物品。事实上，利用甘蔗糖厂副产物可生产的东西还很多，例如人造丝、丙酮丁醇、柠檬酸、甘油、干冰、乳酸等好几十种，如果将这些产品继续加工，还可制出千千万万的产品。四千万吨甘蔗的蔗渣制得的粘胶丝和糠醛，可制人造丝八十万吨，尼龙二十万吨，可织布六十多亿公尺，全国每人平均有二丈多。由此可见甘蔗综合利用具有重大意义。
    糖厂大搞综合利用，有利条件是很多的，首先是资源丰富，原料就在本厂。其次，糖厂是季节性生产，有很多设备可以利用。一般糖厂都有些家底子，潜力很大。各工业体系的技术装备虽有其特殊性，但也有其共同点，如化工设备十五个单元，糖厂就有十三个。内江三元糖厂只增加了水解锅和脱色桶等设备，就由糖厂改为一个年产二千吨的葡萄糖厂。
    再者，以厂办厂、老厂办新厂，不需要另摆摊子，可减少非生产性的投资，大大节省了干部。
    几年来各地在甘蔗综合利用上已摸索了一些经验，许多产品已开始在车间或工场进行生产，这些都是今后大搞甘蔗综合利用的有利条件。把综合利用运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    当前糖料综合利用的方针是：以加速发展食糖生产为主，大力开展糖料综合利用事业，充分利用糖料资源。
    为了使综合利用迅速在各产糖区广泛深入地开展起来，必须注意以下几个问题：
    一、大搞群众运动。事实表明，甘蔗综合利用开展的过程也是思想剧烈斗争的过程，这个斗争首先反映在甘蔗综合利用是走冷冷清清依靠少数人的专家路线呢，还是走轰轰烈烈依靠多数人的群众路线。走前一条路线，肯定不能收到预期的效果。只有政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，继续破除迷信，充分发动群众，依靠群众，自力更生，克服困难，才能把糖料综合利用事业蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。四川省内江专区甘蔗综合利用所以搞得好，最根本的一条经验就是加强了党的领导，大走群众路线。
    二、土洋结合、大中小结合。洋法生产，需要的劳动力少，劳动强度低，产品质量较有保证。有条件的可以采用洋法生产。但是，目前在以钢为纲全面跃进的情况下，不可能有更多的钢铁和机械设备来满足轻工业的发展。因此，在开始搞糖料综合利用时，必须十分慎重地考虑所需设备的来源。如果设备不足，应该是走：土法先上马，走土洋结合的道路。
    我国中、小型糖厂的数量大，今后在一定时间内，糖厂建设的发展还是以中小型为主。因此，在综合利用方面，也应该更多的设置一些小型车间或工段。
    三、糖料综合利用的范围和主次、急缓。从糖出发，一连串地搞下去，可以生产千万种产品，以蔗渣为例，精选蔗渣可以造纸；筛余蔗渣可制糠醛，糠醛可制尼龙66、聚脂树脂、塑料等等，聚脂树脂又可作玻璃钢，尼龙可以作飞机轮胎的帘子线、衣服等生活用品。
    糖料综合利用产品的种类很多，先抓什么？后抓什么？何者为主？何者为次？这是一个值得研究的问题。在发动群众大闹糖料综合利用的时候，不宜先划框框，以免影响群众的积极性。但是，在群众已经发动起来，已掌握有关需要与可能的情况以后，应该明确主、次与缓、急。那种为了追求产值和利润，只搞高级产品，不愿搞急需的一般产品，或者是技术上还未达到一定的成熟程度就大搞起来，都是不对的。各地应该根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，然后根据本身情况，作出规划，把力量使用在最急需的地方。纸、纸板和酒精都是目前迫切需要的，生产愈多愈好；糠醛、丙酮丁醇、柠檬酸、甘油等都可以多搞。总之要抓当前急需的主要产品，当然不是说可以忽视次要产品，次要的产品只要有出路，技术和设备条件具备，也可以生产。
