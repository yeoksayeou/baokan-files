    Tianshan Snow Water
    Gu Gong
    Snow water, flow on!
    The snow on Tianshan has melted. Snow water rushes out along the stone walls, through the cracks, and down the narrow valleys...
    The snow water is absorbed by the sand grains in the desert, evaporated by the scorching sun, turning into wisps of white mist, turning into clusters of white clouds...
    White clouds adorn the peaks of Tianshan, but the earth remains so parched, so parched.
    But today, no, no, it cannot be like this, it will not be like this anymore.
    Underneath the desert, the sound of pickaxes rings out, the sound of shovels rings out, the sound of people's panting and people's clamor rings out... On the ground, wells appear, one after another, like horse hoof prints; beneath the earth, the sound of gurgling water echoes.
    Ah, snow water! From the peaks of Tianshan, it flows past the foothills, flows through underground channels tens of miles, hundreds of miles long, flowing out at the entrance of every village; flowing out in front of every commune member's water jar; flowing out beside every patch of verdant seedlings...
    Snow water, flow on! Flow on! Flow to your heart's content...
    Snow water! Today, you have also learned to sing a light and cheerful song!
    The Shepherd
    The night is deep, the cold wave has arrived, the shepherd has set up his tent.
    The flock of sheep huddles inside the tent, resting; the shepherd lights a fire outside the tent.
    The shepherd walks back and forth, back and forth, around the tent, around the fire...
    In the dark forest, the wild wolves utter their mournful howls; in the gloomy mountain valleys, the hungry bears utter their coarse roars... These howls and roars even make Tianshan tremble slightly! But the shepherd still calmly folds his hands, he only holds the gun under his arm a little tighter.
    The shepherd thinks of herding water buffalo as a child; thinks of his mother's instructions when he joined the army; thinks of life on the frontier, in the sentry box; thinks of the letters from the commune; thinks of the moment when he shears wool with spring shears... thinking, thinking, he always chuckles unconsciously.
    Stars appear beside him, one by one; stars dim at his feet, one by one.
    Look, a patch of red light shines on the edge of the mountain peak again!
    The shepherd vigorously pats the frost on the tent, and the sheep all wake up at once, jump up, and bleat affectionately around the shepherd.
    The crisp sound of sheep bells rings again, on the streamside, on the grassland, clanging...

    The Fertilizer Warehouse
    A small reconnaissance team is roving in Tianshan.
    Leading the team is an old Kazakh man, who knows Tianshan as well as he knows the lines on his palm; following behind are several demobilized soldiers, who love Tianshan as much as they love their distant homeland. They walk, they walk...
    They have been walking for more than ten days, they are scouting for fertilizer sources.
    There are many, many sheepfolds in Tianshan – left by some diligent shepherd; he and his flock stayed here for a period of time, and this place became a fertilizer warehouse.
    The old man and the soldiers kick up clouds of snowflakes on the snow slopes as they rush and slide forward; the old man and the soldiers chop out ledges beside the ice columns as they climb forward... They find patches of black and thick sheep manure under a cluster of tree branches hanging with sheep bones.
    Following the path they walked, a long line came again, carrying shoulder poles and baskets. They are in high spirits and full of vigor, they all know they have discovered a mineral deposit that will nourish the fields.
    Float On! Float Towards the Fields
    A gust of raging wind, a current of gray sand, has blocked the underground canal here.
    The lips of the land and the people are dry and cracked; the new leaves and the newborn foals are drooping their heads from thirst. In the air, there seems to tremble a silent sigh.
    The People's Liberation Army – the sons and daughters of the people, arrived at this time.
    War horses pull ropes, ropes pull buckets, buckets are filled with mud and sand, mud and sand are poured onto the ground...
    The people – the army, are all fighting together, fighting together.
    The round mirror above the well opening faces the sun; the sun slides across the mirror surface and drills into the bottom of the well. Ah! How lively it is at the bottom of the well! There are division commanders, soldiers, Uyghur youths, Kazakh girls... They all immerse their bodies in the mud, they all scoop the mud into buckets. Busy, busy, no one stops...
    The next day, the dry riverbed began to moisten;
    The third day, the clear stream began to babble;
    The fourth day, the bright waves began to roll...
    People, standing on the embankment, scatter flowers, melons, and raisins on the water surface. Let these colors, let these fruits, float on! Float on! Float towards the fields, float towards home...
    People, holding the hands of the soldiers, do not let go for a long time, do not let go for a long time. Is it because of the brilliance of the water? Is it because of the emotion in their hearts? Look, the people's eyes are brighter, the corners of their eyes are moist...

    天山雪水
    顾工
    雪水，你流吧！
    天山上的雪化了。雪水顺着石壁，顺着隙缝，顺着狭谷，冲泻出来……。
    雪水被沙漠上的砂粒吸干了，被炽热的太阳蒸发了，化成缕缕白雾，化成团团白云……
    白云点缀着天山的山巅，但大地依然是这样地干渴、干渴。
    可是今天，不，不，不能这样不再这样。
    在沙漠的底下，响起洋镐的声音，响起铁铲的声音，响起人们喘息和人们喧哗的声音……。地面上，出现了一个挨一个，一个挨一个，马蹄印般地井眼；地层下，响起了潺潺地流水的声音。
    雪水啊！从天山的山巅，流过山脚，流过几十里、几百里长的地下渠道，在每个农村的村口流出来了；在每个公社社员的水缸前流出来了；在每片翠绿色的根苗旁流出来了……
    雪水啊！你流吧！流吧！尽情地流……
    雪水啊！在今天，你也学会了唱一支轻快的欢畅的歌！
    牧羊人
    夜深了，寒潮来了，牧羊人支起了帐篷。
    羊群挤在帐篷里面憩睡着；牧羊人在帐篷外面生起一堆火。
    牧羊人围着帐篷、围着火，走来走去，走来走去……
    黑压压的森林里，野狼发出凄厉的嚎叫；阴沉沉的山坳中，饿熊发出粗鲁的吼声……这些嚎吼，弄得天山也有些微微发颤呢！但是牧羊人还是坦然地拢着手，他只是把掖下的枪支挟得更紧些。
    牧羊人想着小时候放水牛的情景；想着参军时母亲的叮咛；想着在边防、在哨棚里的生活；想着公社里的来信；想着自己用弹簧剪剪羊毛的时刻……想着，想着，他总是不自觉地噗嗤嗤地笑起来。
    一颗颗星星在他身边闪现；一颗颗星星又在他脚边暗淡。
    你看，山巅边又亮起一片红光！
    牧羊人用力拍打了一下帐篷上的寒霜，羊群一下子都苏醒过来，跳跃起来了，围着牧羊人亲热地咩咩地叫着。
    清脆地羊铃，又在溪流边，草地上，铮铮地响起……。
    肥料的仓库
    一支小小的侦察队，在天山里游动。
    领头的是一位哈萨克族的老人，他熟悉天山，像熟悉自己的掌纹；后面跟着的是几位才复员的战士，他们热爱天山，像热爱遥远的乡土。他们走着，走着……
    他们已经走了十来天了，他们在侦察肥源。
    天山里面是有很多很多的羊窝子——不知是那一位辛勤的牧羊人留下的；他和他的羊群，在这里逗留了一个时期，这里便成了肥料的仓库。
    老人和战士，在雪坡上，激起一团团雪花，他们冲滑着前进；老人和战士，在冰柱旁，砍出一道道棱坎，他们攀登着前进……。他们在一簇挂着羊骨头的树枝下，发现了一片片又黑又厚的羊肥。
    顺着他们走过的路，又开来了长长的队伍，抗扁担的，背筐篓的。他们兴致勃勃，神采飞扬，他们都知道发现了营养田野的矿藏。
    飘吧！飘向田野
    一阵阵的狂风，一股股的灰沙，把这里的地下水渠堵塞了。
    土地和人们的嘴唇，都干燥得裂了缝；新叶和才生的马驹，都饥渴得垂下了头。空气中，似乎颤动着无声的叹息。
    解放军——人民子弟兵，在这个时候赶来了。
    战马拉着绳索，绳索拉着吊桶，吊桶盛满泥沙，泥沙泼在地面……
    人民——军队，都在一起战斗着，战斗着。
    井口上的圆镜，面迎着太阳；太阳滑过镜面，钻进了井底。啊！井底是多么地热闹啊！有师长，有战士，有维吾尔族青年，有哈萨克族姑娘……他们都把身子浸在泥浆里，他们都把泥浆盛在吊桶里。忙碌、忙碌，谁也不停歇……
    第二天，干枯的河床开始潮润了；
    第三天，清清的流水开始喧哗了；
    第四天，明亮的波浪开始翻滚了……
    人们，站在堤岸上，把花，把瓜、把葡萄干，洒向水面。让这些彩色，让这些果实，飘吧！飘吧！飘向田野，飘向家园……
    人们，牵着战士的手，久久不放，久久不放。是因为水光的辉映呢？是因为内心的感动？你看，人们的眼睛更亮了，人们的眼角润湿了……。
