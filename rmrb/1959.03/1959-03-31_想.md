    Thinking……
    Yang Tiannong
    People live every day, and every day there are new things that compel people to understand them; there are new problems that compel people to solve them. Recognizing new things and solving new problems both require thinking. Some things or problems cannot be immediately recognized and solved today, but as long as we think about them, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow… we will always recognize and solve them.
    As the saying goes, "A frown brings a plan to mind." The "frown" here is the act of thinking, and "a plan to mind" means a solution has been devised. Of course, many things are not that simple, and a single "frown" is not enough; we need to think deeply and repeatedly. As for our socialist construction, in the context of the Great Leap Forward, new things are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and new problems are constantly placed before us. In order to promptly recognize new things and support their growth; in order to promptly solve new problems and continuously leap forward, and then leap forward again, it is even more necessary for us to think diligently, repeatedly, and doubly. We must think and then experiment, experiment and then think again, to solve problems well and promote the development of construction.
    I heard a report from Zhang Qiuxiang, a national model worker and cotton-growing expert, which included an example of being good at thinking. Last year, she and a dozen others went to Shanxi Province to visit and learn cotton-growing experience. They found that people there used a brush to apply sugar water to the cotton bolls. She asked what the sugar water did, and they said that a demobilized soldier had taught them the method, but they couldn't explain the reason. In the evening, the visitors discussed the issue together. Some people said that since there was no reason, applying it might not necessarily increase production. But Zhang Qiuxiang pondered the matter. As she thought, she figured out the reason: because it is hot in the summer, the cotton has little moisture, and bees collect honey, absorbing nutrients from the pistils, reducing the flowers' nutrition. Applying sugar water can increase moisture and nutrients, which will definitely help increase production. After everyone had finished speaking, she expressed her thoughts. Others thought it made sense and immediately wrote letters to their communes to introduce and promote the method. At this time, Zhang Qiuxiang was different again. After returning to her commune, she discussed it with everyone and first selected three cotton plants in their cotton-growing team for experimentation. After a few days, they found that the effect was very good, and only then did they promote it universally.
    From this small matter, we can see that Zhang Qiuxiang's ability to become a national outstanding cotton-growing expert is by no means accidental. One of the main reasons is that she knows how to think. She did not think out of thin air, but combined her cotton-growing experience and thought about the relationship between weather, bees, and moisture and nutrients. In fact, whether this idea is scientific needs to be further studied, and even if it is scientific, it may not be possible to universally feed cotton sugar water across the country at present, but I think this does not matter, because thinking is the first step, and the experiment is still preliminary. We can continue to think and experiment. For example, if the idea that increasing moisture and nutrients in cotton bolls can increase cotton production is scientific, then it should not only be proven by sugar water, but other methods should also be proven. Therefore, we need to experiment with other methods; similarly, if other experiments also prove that this is correct, then we will definitely be able to find something to replace sugar. In short, continuous thinking will lead to continuous answers. Watt's invention of the steam engine, which advanced the entire social production by an era, didn't it start with thinking about how the steam from a kettle of boiling water could lift the lid?
    The brain is a tool for thought. Tools should be used every day, and when they are used, they become very flexible. Frowning more often will bring "plans" to mind quickly and in large numbers. Conversely, if tools are not used often, they will rust. If you don't think often, don't observe new things around you, and don't study problems, your thinking will become rigid and dull, and you will become a lazy thinker.

    想……
    杨田农
    人们天天生活着，天天会有新的事物，迫着人去认识它；会有新的问题，迫着人去解决它。认识新事物和解决新问题，都要通过脑子想一想。有些事物或问题，今天是不会马上认识和解决的，但只要我们动脑子想，明天、后天……总会认识和解决的。
    俗话说“眉头一皱，计上心来”。这里的“皱”眉头，就是在动脑子，“计上心”，就是想出了办法。当然，有许多事情，并不是那样简单，只靠一“皱”还不行，那就要往深里想，反复地想。至于说到我们的社会主义建设，在大跃进形势下，新事物像雨后春笋般的出现，新问题不断摆在我们面前。为了及时认识新事物，扶持新事物成长；为了及时解决新问题，不断地跃进，再跃进，就更需要我们勤动脑子，反复地想，加倍地想，想了就去试验，试作了再来想，才能解决好问题，推动建设的发展。
    我听到过全国劳动模范、植棉能手张秋香的一个报告，里面就有一个善于想的例子。去年她和十几个人到山西省参观学习植棉经验，发现人家把白糖和水，用毛笔抹在棉花疙瘩上。她问白糖水起什么作用，人家说，这是一个复员军人教给的，知道方法，说不出道理。晚上，参观的人一起讨论了这个问题。有些人就说，既然没什么道理，抹上了对增产不一定能起作用。但张秋香却闷住气想，想着想着，她想出道理来了，因为夏天天热，棉花上水分少，加上蜜蜂采蜜，吸收了花蕊的养分，花的营养减少了，用白糖水抹，可以增加水分和养分，一定可以帮助增产。等大家说完了，她说出了自己的想法，别人都觉得有道理，马上都纷纷给自己社里写信介绍推广。这时的张秋香却又不一样，她回社后同大家一商量，就先在她们务棉小组选了三株棉花试验，几天以后就发现效果很好，这才普遍推广了。
    就从这件小事上，也可以看出张秋香能成为全国出色的植棉能手，绝不是偶然的。主要的原因之一就是她会想。她并非凭空想，而是结合了她植棉的经验，想到了天气、蜜蜂和水分、养分的关系。其实，这种想法是否科学，还需要再进一步去研究，而且，即使是科学的，全国要普遍给棉花喂白糖水，目前怕也办不到，但我以为这不要紧，因为这想才是第一步，试了也还是初步的。还可以再想下去，试下去。例如，如果说在棉花疙瘩上增加水分和养分能够增产棉花的想法是科学的，那末，就不只是用白糖水能得到证明，别的方法也应该得到证明。因此，还需要用别的方法试验；同样，如果其他的试验也证明了这是正确的话，那末，也就一定能找出代替白糖的东西来了。总之不断地想，就会不断的得到答案。瓦特的发明蒸汽机，使整个社会生产前进了一个时代，不也是先从一壶沸水的热气能够冲起壶盖想起的吗？
    脑子是思想的工具，工具应该天天使用，用起来就很灵便，多皱皱眉头，“计”就上来的快，上来的多。相反，工具不常用，便会生锈，不常动脑子，不观察周围的新事物，不研究问题，思想就会变得僵化、迟钝，就是一个思想懒汉了。
