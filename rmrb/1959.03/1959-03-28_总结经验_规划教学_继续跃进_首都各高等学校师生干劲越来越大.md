Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Universities and colleges in the capital are universally summing up the experiences of implementing the Party's education policy last year. Based on these experiences and the characteristics of each school's major, they have comprehensively planned this year's teaching, production, and scientific research work, striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Currently, more than ten colleges, including Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Foreign Trade College, and Beijing Mining Institute, have completed their summing-up work. Most schools, including Peking University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Medical College, are in the process of summing up.

The experiences summarized by the schools first show that the implementation of the Party's education policy last year has achieved great results. The political ideology of teachers and students has been improved, their labor viewpoint has been strengthened, and students' ability to work independently and study theory has also been greatly improved. This has fundamentally changed the situation of theory being divorced from practice in past teaching work, and has brought a new look to all aspects of the school's work. This year, in order to further implement the Party's education policy, all schools have made comprehensive arrangements for teaching, labor, and life. In terms of labor, schools have determined that students should mainly participate in labor related to their major, while also participating in certain social public welfare labor. The labor time is generally set at about three months. Labor outlines or plans should be formulated for each batch of students participating in production labor, so that they can learn certain production knowledge and receive comprehensive training according to the plan in a relatively short period of time. Schools should conduct regular assessments of students' training in labor. To this end, most schools have adjusted their labor sites, strengthened the leadership of school-run factories and farms, and established fixed cooperative relationships with counterpart factories and people's communes.

In terms of teaching, all schools have strengthened the teaching of basic theory and various professional theory courses based on the new requirements put forward by the combination of education and productive labor for theoretical teaching. Most engineering colleges have enriched the content of basic theory courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and have universally added courses on the latest scientific and technological aspects such as modern physics and isotope applications. Liberal arts colleges have universally increased the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism related to their majors, and have adjusted the proportion of ancient, modern, Chinese, and foreign content in many courses to make them more comprehensive and systematic. Regarding scientific research work, based on last year's experience, all schools have determined that on the one hand, they should closely integrate with the major issues in the country's current production and construction, and on the other hand, they should also strengthen the research of various basic theories.

Last year was a year of victory for the Party's mass line in all aspects of work in universities and colleges. Schools have accumulated many rich experiences on this issue. Last year, due to the implementation of the mass line in teaching, a new teacher-student relationship of mutual teaching and learning has been formed. This year, in order to promote the further development of this new teacher-student relationship, all schools have decided to further give play to the leading role of teachers in teaching under the principle of Party leadership and mutual teaching and learning, and encourage teachers to actively do a good job in "imparting knowledge, solving doubts." Students should respect teachers and learn from them seriously, and at the same time, they can also put forward opinions on the shortcomings in teaching work in the spirit of promoting democracy.

All schools believe that strengthening the Party's leadership and ensuring that the school's teaching, production, and scientific research work are carried out under the principle of putting politics in command is the fundamental reason for the great achievements made last year. To this end, this year all schools will further strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen the theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism, and enable all teachers and students to further transform themselves based on Marxist ideology and improve their work.

After summing up last year's experiences and clarifying this year's tasks, the enthusiasm of teachers and students in all schools is growing stronger. Teachers are working hard to improve the quality of lectures, experimental guidance, and scientific research. Students are also studying diligently and working actively. Teachers at Normal University are adopting the method of mutual observation to improve classroom theoretical lectures. Teachers at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute have established regular teaching research groups to simultaneously conduct research and experiments on several teaching methods. Teachers at the Beijing Mining Institute and the Beijing Institute of Geology have compiled new achievements confirmed in production last year into teaching materials. Teachers in liberal arts schools are actively improving teaching quality, and the atmosphere of academic discussion is becoming stronger. Renmin University of China has launched discussions on issues such as commodity production based on last year's investigations, and will soon hold a series of school-wide teacher discussion meetings on issues in philosophy and political economy.

    总结经验　规划教学　继续跃进
    首都各高等学校师生干劲越来越大
    新华社27日讯　首都各高等学校正在普遍总结去年贯彻党的教育方针的经验，根据这些经验和各校的专业特点，全面规划了今年的教学、生产和科学研究工作，争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    现在，清华大学、北京地质学院、北京农业大学、北京对外贸易学院、北京矿业学院等十多个院校总结工作已经结束。北京大学、中国人民大学、北京师范大学、北京医学院等多数学校正在总结中。
    各校总结的经验首先表明，去年贯彻党的教育方针取得了巨大的成绩；师生的政治思想提高了，劳动观点加强了，学生的独立工作能力和钻研理论的能力也有很大提高，从根本上改变了过去教学工作中理论脱离实际的状况，使学校各方面的工作，面貌为之一新。今年，为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，各校都对教学、劳动和生活作了全面安排。在劳动方面，各校确定学生以参加和所学专业相近的劳动为主，同时参加一定的社会公益劳动。劳动时间一般定为三个月左右。每批学生参加生产劳动都要制订劳动大纲或劳动计划，以便在比较短的时间里按计划学会一定的生产知识，得到全面锻炼。学校对学生在劳动中锻炼的情形要进行定期地考查。多数学校为此调整了劳动场所，加强了校办工厂、农场的领导，并和挂钩工厂、人民公社建立了固定的协作关系。
    在教学上，各校都根据教育和生产劳动相结合对理论教学提出的新的要求，加强了基础理论和各种专业理论课的教学。多数工科院校充实了数、理、化等基础理论课的内容，普遍增设了近代物理、同位素应用等最新科学技术方面的课程。文科各校普遍增加了和专业有关的马列主义基本理论，在不少课程中调整了古、今、中、外的比例，使之更加全面更加系统。关于科学研究工作，各校根据去年的经验，确定一方面要密切结合国家当前生产建设中的重大问题进行，同时也要加强各种基本理论的研究。
    去年一年是党的群众路线在高等学校各方面工作中取得胜利的一年。各校在这个问题上积累了许多丰富的经验。去年，由于在教学上贯彻了群众路线，一种教学相长的新的师生关系已经形成。今年为促进这种新的师生关系进一步发展，各校决定在党的领导和教学相长的原则下，进一步发挥教师在教学方面的主导作用，鼓励教师积极做好“传道、解惑”工作。学生应该尊敬教师，认真地向教师学习，同时也可以本着发扬民主的精神对教学工作中的缺点提出意见。
    各校认为，加强党的领导，使学校的教学、生产和科学研究工作都在政治挂帅的原则下来进行，这是去年工作取得巨大成绩的根本原因。为此，今年各校都将进一步加强党的领导，加强马列主义理论教育，使全体师生根据马克思主义思想进一步改造自己，提高工作。
      在总结去年的经验和明确了今年的任务后，各校师生的劲头越来越大。教师们正在努力地提高讲课、实验指导和科学研究的质量。学生们也在认真地读书，积极地劳动。师大的教师正在采取互相观摩的办法，改进课堂理论讲授。北京外国语学院的教师建立了定期的教学研究会，就几种教学方法同时作研究试验。北京矿业学院、北京地质学院的教师把去年生产上肯定的新成就编进了教材。文科学校教师都在积极提高教学质量，学术讨论的空气更浓了。中国人民大学已经在去年调查的基础上就商品生产等问题展开了讨论，最近还要就哲学和政治经济学上的一些问题连续举行全校教师的讨论会。
