Xinhua News Agency report: In addition to achieving a great leap forward in livestock production last year, Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, also experienced rapid development in poultry production. The National Poultry Production On-Site Conference, recently held here, promoted the county's poultry raising experience.

The characteristics of Qingyuan County's poultry industry are: particularly good collective poultry farming; high marketability; large quantity raised; and rapid development. Last year, the number of poultry raised reached 6.53 million, nearly double that of 1957, with an average of fifty per household. Due to fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Commune system and vigorously developing collective livestock and poultry farming, the county has achieved "eight farms in every commune" (namely pig, cattle, sheep, chicken, duck, goose, rabbit, and bee farms) and "five farms in every team" (namely pig, cattle, chicken, duck, and goose farms). There are over 5,000 collective poultry farms in the county, with publicly raised poultry accounting for the vast majority. Last year, a total of over 860,000 live poultry were sold to the state, exceeding the state plan by 150,000.

The main reasons for the rapid development of poultry production in the county last year are: the county party committee strengthened leadership over the entire animal husbandry industry, paid attention to grasping planning, comprehensively arranged the annual production, and urged implementation at all levels; relevant departments, especially agriculture, commerce, banking, and grain departments, paid attention to cooperation and conducted on-site inspections, evaluations, and competitions on a large scale. In vigorously developing collective breeding, they adopted the principles of "small, local, and mass," and launched mass movements to establish over 5,000 poultry (livestock) farms in a short period of time using simple and indigenous methods, ensuring the needs of rapid development of collective breeding. While vigorously developing collective breeding, this commune also organized member households to raise privately and mobilized organs, schools, factories, and enterprises to raise poultry, forming a widespread nationwide poultry raising movement.

The great development of the poultry industry in Qingyuan last year is inseparable from the planned efforts to select and retain breeding poultry, self-breed and self-raise, and ensure the source of chicks. Last year, the county achieved "leaving all hens, not eating seed eggs," and established 350 hatcheries to systematically and massively propagate seedlings.

In order to make poultry breed quickly and raise well, Qingyuan County also attached great importance to the feeding and management of poultry. In addition to selecting a group of party members and youth league members to strengthen the backbone force and arranging 50,000 members with certain feeding experience to form specialized teams to raise poultry by specific personnel, specific responsibilities, in groups, by size, and by gender, the county party committee also vigorously promoted the planting of feed bases and the use of a variety of feeds.

    广东清远家禽生产发展迅速
    全县平均每户社员养鸡鸭鹅五十只
    据新华社讯　广东省清远县去年在取得家畜生产大跃进的同时，家禽生产也有了飞跃的发展。不久以前在这里举行的全国家禽生产现场会议，推广了这个县的养禽经验。
    清远县养禽业的特点是：集体养禽业搞的特别好；商品率高；养的多；发展得快。去年家禽饲养量达到六百五十三万只，比1957年翻了将近一番，每户平均五十只；由于充分发挥人民公社制度的优越性，大力发展集体畜禽业，全县已实现“社社办八场”（即猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、蜂八场）“队队办五场”（即猪、牛、鸡、鸭、鹅）。县内集体养禽场共有五千余个，其中公养家禽占了绝大部分。去年全年交售给国家的活禽八十六万多只，超额十五万只完成了国家计划。
    这个县去年家禽生产迅速发展的主要原因，是由于县委加强对整个畜牧业的领导，注意抓计划，全面安排全年生产，并层层督促贯彻；有关部门特别是农业、商业、银行、粮食等部门都注意进行协作，并且大搞现场检查评比竞赛。在大力发展集体饲养业中，他们采取小、土、群的方针，大搞群众运动，在短期内用穷办法、土办法建立了禽（畜）场五千余个，保证了集体饲养业迅速发展的需要。这个公社在大力发展集体饲养的同时，又组织社员家庭私养和发动机关、学校、工厂、企业饲养，形成了广泛的全民养禽运动。
    清远去年养禽业的大发展是和有计划的抓好选留种禽、自繁自养，保证雏禽的来源等方面分不开的，这里去年做到“见雌就留，种蛋不食”，并建立孵房三百五十处，有计划地大量繁殖种苗。
    为了使家禽繁殖的快，养的好，清远县还十分重视家禽的饲养管理。县委除了选拔一批党团员充实骨干力量和安排五万个有一定的饲养经验的社员组成专业队，专人、专责、分群、分大小和分公母的方法饲养家禽外，还大搞饲料基地种植和采用多种多样的饲料。（附图片）
