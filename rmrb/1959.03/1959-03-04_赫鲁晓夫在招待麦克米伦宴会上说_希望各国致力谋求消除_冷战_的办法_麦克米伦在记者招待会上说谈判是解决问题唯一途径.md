Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd. The Soviet government held a grand banquet in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the evening of the 2nd to entertain British Prime Minister Macmillan.

Macmillan, along with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and other British activists, attended the banquet.

The Soviet side was represented by: Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Kosygin, and Polyansky.

Among the guests were members of the Iraqi government delegation, members of the Romanian government delegation, and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev and Macmillan delivered speeches at the banquet.

In his speech, Khrushchev first thanked the British Prime Minister for making the decision to visit the Soviet Union, despite the prejudice held by some in Britain and its allies regarding the benefits of this visit and meeting with Soviet leaders.

Khrushchev said that we are satisfied with the exchange of opinions. Our talks took place on various occasions and in different atmospheres. We hope that when you talk with your allies in the future, and when we talk with our allies, everyone will be dedicated to seeking solutions that are acceptable to both sides and conform to the purpose of eliminating the "Cold War." Khrushchev said that since we have exchanged views and clarified our positions, you and we are now better prepared for this matter. The mere fact that we now have a better understanding of each other's views demonstrates the benefits of such a meeting.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the British guests put forward some interesting ideas, especially on the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev said that this meeting, as Mr. Macmillan described when he set off from Britain, was a reconnaissance, a probe, so it is not expected to solve major problems. But we hope that this probe will eventually lead to results that will be welcomed by both the British and Soviet people.

Khrushchev continued, "In the talks, we have expressed our ideas on how we think the German question should be resolved. We hope to eliminate all the remnants of the last war that are still felt today, and we hope that the international atmosphere will become clearer. We believe that concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanies and resolving the West Berlin issue will also help to achieve this."

Khrushchev pointed out that, in fact, the Soviet side is proposing to affirm the actual situation that has formed since the defeat of Hitler's Germany until today.

Khrushchev said that in the notes sent to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and other countries today, we have once again clarified our attitude towards all these issues. We hope that the British government and the governments of other Western countries will show due attention to the normalization of international relations and the elimination of the "Cold War" state.

Khrushchev said that we have suggested concluding a Soviet-British treaty of non-aggression, because we believe that this is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also beneficial to strengthening universal peace. In this treaty, we can undertake obligations such as: neither side shall infringe upon the other, and neither shall use force or the threat of force against the other. It would also be good if we could undertake the obligation of not allowing the establishment of new foreign military bases in our two countries and taking measures to eliminate existing foreign military bases.

Khrushchev said that all disputes that may arise between the Soviet Union and Britain should be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Charter, through negotiations, and in a spirit of mutual understanding. Establishing good neighborly relations and greater mutual understanding is not only beneficial to the people of both countries, but also to the people of other countries, because it can strengthen universal security.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the heads of government of the two countries also exchanged views on trade issues during their talks. He said that the current scale of trade between the two countries is insufficient. We welcome the interest of the British national leaders in developing mutually beneficial trade relations. There are also many companies in Britain that hope to receive new orders, and we can place large orders. This is not only beneficial to the Soviet Union, but also to Britain.

Khrushchev emphasized that our seven-year plan is aimed at completing it by using our own resources. If other countries, including Britain, wish to obtain large additional orders and allocate loans for this purpose, then we are willing to sign agreements on the above basis. We can note with satisfaction that an agreement has been reached on expanding Soviet-British scientific, technological, and cultural exchanges. This is a good start. Contacts and exchange of delegations will help the people of all countries better understand each other.

Khrushchev expressed the hope that future negotiations between Soviet and British representatives will make the agreements already reached on all these issues more concrete. He also expressed the hope that friendly and cooperative relations can be established between the Soviet Union and Britain.

Macmillan then delivered a speech at the banquet. He said that his visit "should be a useful preparation for broader international negotiations in the future."

Macmillan believes that "holding negotiations on the basis of understanding gained through comprehensive discussions and with the sincerity of reaching a just agreement" is the correct path.

Macmillan expressed his warm gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their gracious and friendly reception. He pointed out that during his visit to the Soviet Union, the construction and economic development he saw in the Soviet Union left him with "a truly strong impression." He went on to say that these achievements are even more remarkable if you recall the scenes of destruction caused by the war. Macmillan congratulated the Anglo-Soviet trade and cultural agreements.

Referring to the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty between Britain and the Soviet Union, Macmillan said that he agreed on the following points:

All disputes between the two countries should be resolved in the spirit and terms of the United Nations Charter;

Neither government should attempt to unilaterally undermine each other's rights, obligations, and vital interests;

The two governments recognize, in accordance with these principles, that disputes should be resolved through negotiation and not by resorting to force.

Macmillan immediately added that this in no way involves Britain's firm commitment to supporting its military alliances.

He stated, "Britain will stand by our defensive alliances until that happy day arrives when such protective measures can be abandoned in the world."

Macmillan said that no matter how great the differences between Britain and the Soviet Union may be, he still believes that "our fundamental goal is the same, namely to prevent the outbreak of a third world war."

Referring to the frank exchange of views in Moscow, Macmillan said: "We do not want to avoid our differences, but each side wants to understand these differences and the reasons for them."

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd. According to a TASS report from Moscow: British Prime Minister Macmillan held a press conference in Moscow on the 3rd. The press conference lasted for forty minutes.

Macmillan made a statement at the beginning of the press conference. Referring to the Soviet-British communique just signed in the Kremlin, Macmillan's statement said that this document clarifies the basic aspects of the issues discussed during the talks. He said that those issues on which there are differences between East and West should be resolved through negotiations with the sincerity of resolving these issues.

He added that the real value of his talks with Soviet national leaders lies in the fact that both sides have a better understanding of each other's attitudes.

Macmillan said: "I have not come here to hold formal negotiations. But these talks are the basis for the talks to be held in the coming months."

Macmillan reminded reporters that he refused to disclose the content of his secret talks with Khrushchev. He said that if I did, then the talks would lose all value.

Macmillan told reporters that he intends to meet with Western representatives to discuss some of the issues he talked about during his visit to the Soviet Union.

The British Prime Minister answered many questions raised by Soviet and foreign journalists.

In response to a question from a "Pravda" reporter about the prospects for the conclusion of a Soviet-British non-aggression treaty, he advocated continuing negotiations and consultations on this issue based on the principles in the Soviet-British communique just signed.

At the request of a reporter from the British "Workers' Daily," Macmillan explained the passage he had spoken at the banquet in the Grand Kremlin Palace yesterday about the "happy day" when the world could abandon defensive alliances. He pointed out that opposing countries must reach an agreement. He went on to say: "It is not good to make new friends and lose old friends."

A reporter from "International Life" magazine asked what state the British government had taken on the Polish government's famous proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe. Macmillan quoted a passage from the Soviet-British communique, namely that both sides agreed that it would be beneficial to further study the possibility of enhancing and consolidating security by limiting armed forces as well as conventional and nuclear armaments in mutually agreed areas of Europe, and adopting corresponding monitoring systems.

A reporter from "Red Star" newspaper asked Macmillan how he viewed US Secretary of State Dulles' recent statement that the Western countries would not hesitate to use force to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin.

Macmillan believes that such issues must be resolved through negotiation. He said that this is the only way to solve the problem.

Macmillan added that any unilateral action would only lead to dangerous consequences, which must be avoided. He once again emphasized that everything must be done to resolve all issues through negotiation. On this basis, we can make progress.

    赫鲁晓夫在招待麦克米伦宴会上说
    希望各国致力谋求消除“冷战”的办法
    麦克米伦在记者招待会上说谈判是解决问题唯一途径
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联政府2日晚在大克里姆林宫举行盛大宴会，招待英国首相麦克米伦。
    麦克米伦同英国外交大臣劳埃德以及其他英国活动家出席了宴会。
    苏联方面参加宴会的有：阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、柯西金、波利扬斯基。
    在来宾中间还有伊拉克政府代表团成员、罗马尼亚政府代表团成员、各国驻苏联的外交官员等。
    赫鲁晓夫和麦克米伦在宴会上先后致词。
    赫鲁晓夫在致词中首先感谢英国首相不顾英国本国和它的盟国中有人对他这次访问和同苏联领导人的会见的益处抱有某些偏见，而作出了访问苏联的决定。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们对交换意见的情况感到满意。我们的会谈是在各种场合下和不同的温度中进行的。我们希望。你们将来同自己的盟国会谈的时候和我们同自己的盟国会谈的时候，大家都致力于谋求这样的解决办法：它能为双方所接受，并且符合消除“冷战”的目的。赫鲁晓夫说，自从我们经过交谈并互相阐明态度后，你们和我们现在都对这件事有了更好的准备。仅是我们现在已经更好地互相了解彼此的观点这件事，就说明这种会晤的好处了。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，英国客人提出了一些使人感到兴趣的想法，特别是在停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题上。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次会谈，正如麦克米伦先生在从英国起程到这里来的时候所形容的那样，是一次侦察、一次试探，所以就不能指望解决重大问题。但我们希望，这次试探终于会导致既会受到英国人民欢迎、也会受到苏联人民欢迎的结果。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在交谈中，我们已经把我们认为应该如何解决德国问题的想法谈出来了。我们希望消除目前还使人感觉到的上次战争的一切残余，希望国际气氛变得清朗起来。我们认为，同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题也能有助于做到这点。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，其实，苏联方面是在建议把希特勒德国被粉碎后一直到今天所形成了的实际局面确定下来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在今天发给英国、美国、法国和其它国家政府的照会中，我们又一次阐明了对这一切问题的态度。我们希望，英国政府以及其它西方国家政府会对使国际关系正常化和消除“冷战”状态这件事表现应有的注意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们曾经建议缔结苏英两国互不侵犯条约，因为我们认为，这不仅对我们两国人民有好处，而且对加强普遍和平也有好处。在这个条约中可以承担这样的义务：双方互不侵犯，不对对方使用武力或武力威胁。如果能承担这样的义务，即不允许在我们两国境内建立新的外国军事基地，并采取措施来取消现有的外国军事基地，那也是很好的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏英两国之间可能产生的一切争执问题都应根据联合国宪章、通过谈判和本着互相谅解的精神来解决。建立良好睦邻关系和在更大的程度上互相谅解不仅对两国人民有利，对其他各国人民也有利，因为这能加强普遍安全。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，两国政府首脑在交谈的时候还就贸易问题交换了意见。他说，现在两国之间的贸易规模是不够的。我们对英国国家领导人对发展互利的贸易关系感到兴趣这一点表示欢迎。英国也有不少的公司希望得到新的定货，而我们可以订大宗的货物。这不仅对苏联有利，对英国也是有利的。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，我们的七年计划是指望利用自己的资源来完成的。如果其它国家，其中也包括英国，希望获得大宗额外定货并将为此拨出贷款，那么我们愿意在上述的基础上签订协定。我们可以满意地指出，已经就扩大苏英两国的科学技术和文化交流达成协议。这是一个很好的开端。接触和互派代表团有助于各国人民更好的互相了解。
    赫鲁晓夫表示，希望苏英两国代表之间今后的谈判能使在所有这些问题上已达成的协议具体化。他还希望，苏英两国之间能够建立起友好合作的关系。
    麦克米伦接着在宴会上致词。他说，他的访问“对于今后举行更广泛的国际谈判应当是一个有益的准备”。
    麦克米伦认为：“在经过全面讨论而获得的认识的基础上，并怀着达成公正协议的诚意来举行谈判”是正确的途径。
    麦克米伦向苏联政府和人民对他的殷勤而友好的接待表示热烈的感谢。他指出，在访问苏联期间，他所看到的苏联的建设和经济发展给他留下了“真正强烈的印象”。他接着说，如果回想起遭受战争破坏的情景，这些成就甚至还要更加显著。麦克米伦对英苏贸易和文化协议表示祝贺。
    麦克米伦在谈到苏联关于英苏之间签订互不侵犯条约的建议时说，他同意以下几点：
    两国之间的一切争端都应该本着联合国宪章的精神和条款来解决；
    无论此方或彼方政府都不应该企图片面地使彼此的权利、义务和切身利益遭到损害；
    两国政府根据这些原则承认，各种争端应该通过谈判加以解决，而不诉诸武力。
    麦克米伦马上又补充说，这决不牵涉到英国支持它的军事同盟的坚定决心。
    他表示：“英国将坚持我们的防御性联盟，直到世界上可以放弃这种保护性措施的愉快的日子到来。”
    麦克米伦说，无论英苏之间的分歧有多么大，他仍然相信：“我们的基本目标是一致的，那就是防止第三次世界大战的爆发”。
    在谈到在莫斯科坦率地交换意见的时候，麦克米伦说：“我们不想讳言我们的分歧，而是每一方都想了解这些分歧和产生这些分歧的原因。”
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：英国首相麦克米伦3日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会。记者招待会历时四十分钟。
    麦克米伦在记者招待会开始时发表了一项声明。在谈到刚刚在克里姆林宫签字的苏英公报时，麦克米伦的声明说，这个文件阐明了会谈过程中所谈到的那些问题的基本方面。他说，东西方存在着分歧的那些问题，应当在有诚意解决这些问题的情况下通过谈判来解决。
    他又说，他同苏联国家领导人会谈的真正宝贵之处，在于双方更好地了解了对方的态度。
    麦克米伦说：“我到这里来不是为了举行正式的谈判。但是这些会谈是最近几个月将要举行的会谈的基础。”
    麦克米伦提醒记者注意，他拒绝公布他同赫鲁晓夫秘密会谈的内容。他说，如果我这样做，那么这个会谈就失去了一切价值。
    麦克米伦告诉记者，他打算会晤西方代表，磋商他访问苏联期间所谈到的一些问题。
    英国首相回答了苏联和外国记者提出的许多问题。
    在回答“真理报”记者关于缔结苏英互不侵犯条约的前景的问题时，他主张根据刚刚签字的苏英公报中的原则，就这个问题继续举行谈判和磋商。
    应英国“工人日报”记者的请求，麦克米伦解释了他昨天在大克里姆林宫宴会上讲过的、世界上可以放弃防御性联盟的“愉快的日子”来到的一段话。他指出，相对立的国家必须达成协议。他接着说：“交新朋友而丢掉老朋友是不好的”。
    “国际生活”杂志记者问，英国政府对波兰政府关于在欧洲建立无原子武器区的著名建议采取怎样的状态，麦克米伦引述了苏英公报中的一段话，即双方一致认为，进一步研究通过在欧洲的一致同意的地区内限制武装部队以及常规军备和核军备的某些办法，并采取相应的监督制度，来增进巩固安全的可能性是有益处的。
    “红星报”记者问麦克米伦说，他如何对待美国国务卿杜勒斯不久前的这样一种说法，即西方国家为了维持西柏林的占领制度将不惜采用武力。
    麦克米伦认为，这样的问题必须通过谈判来解决。他说，这是唯一能够解决问题的途径。
    麦克米伦补充说，任何单方面的行动都只会导致危险的后果，必须避免这种后果。他再一次强调说，必须做到一切问题只通过谈判来协决。在这个基础上，我们可以获得进展。
