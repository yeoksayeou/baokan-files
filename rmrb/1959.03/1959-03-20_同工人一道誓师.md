Editor's Note:

    It is a gratifying thing that engineering and technical personnel in the Shanghai mechanical system have joined the workers on the leap forward arena.

    Technology serves production. To achieve a greater leap forward in production, we must vigorously promote technological revolution. Many technical problems need to be solved in a timely manner. Therefore, technical personnel need to closely follow the leap forward situation under the leadership of the Party, and work with workers to study and sort out thousands of technical innovation proposals and measures to integrate technical theory more closely with production practice, pushing production to a new level.

    The persistence of technical personnel and the masses of workers in solving key problems in production will be an important starting point for the development of engineering technology towards "heavy, large, precise, and cutting-edge." The engineering and technical personnel of the Shanghai mechanical system have gained a lot in this regard, and it is hoped that they will achieve greater success in this great competition.

    同工人一道誓师
    上海机械系统的工程技术人员紧紧同工人一道登上跃进擂台，这是一件可喜的事情。
    技术是为生产服务的，实现生产更大跃进，必须大搞技术革命。有许多技术问题需要及时解决，因而也就需要技术人员在党的领导下紧紧跟上跃进的形势，同工人一道研究和整理成千上万的技术革新的建议和措施，使技术理论同生产实践结合得更紧。把生产推向更新的水平。
    技术人员同工人群众一起坚持到底解决生产中的关键问题，将是工程技术向“重、大、精、尖”发展的重要起点。上海机械系统的工程技术人员在这方面是有很多收获的，希望他们在这场大比大赛中获得更大的成就。
