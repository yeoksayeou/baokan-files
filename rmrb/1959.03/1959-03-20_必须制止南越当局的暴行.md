The Atrocities of the South Vietnamese Authorities Must Be Stopped
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    On March 19, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army published a memorandum from General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, to Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, on March 6. The memorandum revealed, with a large number of irrefutable facts, the heinous crimes committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique since the restoration of peace in 1954, in which they massively persecuted patriotic people and former resistance members. General Vo Nguyen Giap also demonstrated with convincing materials that it was the US imperialism that was behind the scenes, instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to commit these crimes. US imperialism sought to drag South Vietnam into the Manila military bloc, turn South Vietnam into a military base, and strenuously obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. In the memorandum, General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that since the restoration of peace, 180,843 people have been arrested and imprisoned by the South Vietnamese authorities, 10,185 have been tortured and injured, and 4,971 have died or disappeared. The Chinese people feel great indignation at such heinous crimes committed by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Chinese people express their utmost concern and sympathy for the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who are bravely fighting against US imperialism and its lackeys, and will give them full support.
    As General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out, the Phu Loi incident and other incidents of persecuting the South Vietnamese people and former resistance members are a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam clearly stipulates that no reprisals or discrimination shall be taken against individuals or organizations for their activities during the period of hostilities, and that their democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed. Now, under the instigation of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has established a large number of concentration camps in South Vietnam and is bloodily murdering these innocent patriotic people. This is a serious provocation against the dignity of the Geneva Accords and the conscience of mankind. As a participant in the Geneva Conference, we will never allow the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities to wantonly trample on the Geneva Accords. We hope that the International Commission for Vietnam will immediately accept General Vo Nguyen Giap's solemn request to send mobile teams to Phu Loi and other locations where incidents have occurred to conduct on-site investigations, in order to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam.
    It should be pointed out that the great tragedy of the Phu Loi concentration camp in December 1958 was by no means an isolated incident. This is an integral part of US imperialism's creation of tension in Indochina. As is well known, it was at this time that the United States instigated the Lao authorities to launch military provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from South Vietnam and Laos in two directions. American news agencies have widely publicized that the area near the 17th parallel will become one of the areas of the "Cold War." At the same time, the South Vietnamese Navy, based in Da Nang, invaded our territory of the Xisha Islands and abducted our fishermen and fishing boats. It can be seen that US imperialism is instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to create incidents in all aspects and intensify the tense situation in order to expand its aggression and intervention activities. In order to stop US imperialism's massacre and persecution of the South Vietnamese people and former resistance members, and in order to uphold the Geneva Accords, resolute measures must be taken immediately to conduct a thorough investigation of the Phu Loi incident. The International Commission for Vietnam has an unshirkable responsibility in this regard.

    必须制止南越当局的暴行
    本报评论员
    越南人民军总司令部3月19日公布了越南人民军总司令武元甲大将3月6日给越南国际委员会主席安萨里的一件备忘录，以大量的、无可辩驳的事实揭露了吴庭艳集团在1954年和平恢复以来大量残害爱国人民和前抗战人员的滔天罪行。武元甲大将也以令人信服的材料证明了，在幕后指使吴庭艳集团进行这些罪行的正是要把南越拉入马尼拉军事集团、变南越为军事基地和亟力阻挠越南和平统一的美帝国主义。武元甲大将在备忘录中指出：自从和平恢复以来，受南越当局拘捕和监禁的达十八万零八百四十三人，被虐打成伤的一万零一百八十五人，死亡或失踪的四千九百七十一人。对于美国和吴庭艳集团这种滔天罪行，中国人民感到极大的愤慨；对于正在同美帝国主义和它的走狗作英勇斗争的越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，中国人民寄予无比的关怀和同情，并将全力加以声援。
    正如武元甲大将所指出，富利事件以及其他残害南越人民和前抗战人员的事件乃是对日内瓦协议的严重违反。越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款明文规定，不得对个人和团体因其在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。现在吴庭艳集团在美国指使下，竟然在南越建立大量集中营，并且血腥杀害这些无辜的爱国人民，这是对日内瓦协议的尊严和人类的良知的严重挑衅。作为日内瓦会议的参与国，我们决不允许美国和南越当局对日内瓦协议横加蹂躏。我们希望越南国际委员会立即接受武元甲大将提出的派流动小组到富利以及其他发生事件的地点进行现场调查的严正要求，以保证日内瓦协议在南越得到严格履行。
    应当指出，1958年12月富利集中营的大惨案，决不是偶然的事件。这是美帝国主义在印度支那制造紧张局势的一个组成部分。如所周知，正是在这个时候，美国策动老挝当局向越南民主共和国发动了军事挑衅，企图从南越和老挝两个方向向越南民主共和国进行威胁。美国通讯社大事宣传，十七度线附近地区将成为“冷战”的地区之一。与此同时，以岘港为基地的南越海军侵入了我国领土西沙群岛，掳走我渔民和渔船。由此可见，美帝国主义正指使吴庭艳集团从各方面制造事端，加剧紧张局势，以便扩大侵略和干涉活动。为了制止美帝国主义对南越人民和前抗战人员的残杀迫害，为了维护日内瓦协议，必须立即采取坚决措施，对富利事件进行彻底的调查。越南国际委员会对此负有义不容辞的责任。
