Strengthen the Main Attack Front
Zeng Zhi

Recently, many people's communes have adopted an important measure: transferring a large number of laborers from industry, sideline production, and other undertakings to strengthen the agricultural front. This is like concentrating superior forces to strengthen the main attack direction on the battlefield under certain circumstances, which is of decisive significance for achieving overall victory.

Currently, it is the busy season for spring plowing. Whether we can complete and over fulfill the greater leap forward targets for grain and cotton this year, and whether we can increase the production of oil, flax, animal husbandry, etc., more and better, the primary key lies in whether spring plowing production can be done well. To do a good job in spring plowing production, the first thing to solve is the contradiction between insufficient labor and heavy production tasks. Tool reform is one way to solve this contradiction; rational arrangement and use of labor is another way. The so-called rational arrangement and use of labor is to use each laborer in the place where it is most needed. As the saying goes, "Steel should be used on the blade," that's what it means. Not only should each laborer be used in the place where it is most needed, but also each laborer should be able to maximize their role. Now, among the various fronts of the people's communes, agricultural production can be said to be the "blade." Because "a year's plan starts in spring," the spring plowing production season is tight and fleeting. We must firmly grasp the opportunity of spring plowing and sowing, and use the greatest strength to ensure that the spring sowing task is completed quickly and well.

The people's commune was born out of the needs of production development, and its consolidation and improvement also depend on the continuous development of production. Therefore, the people's commune must pay great attention to the issue of developing production, and concentrate all its strength to develop production. From the perspective of labor use, the principle should be to strive to put all labor into production and minimize non-direct production personnel, such as full-time cadres, service personnel, and cultural and educational staff. Now, some communes' management cadres at all levels are participating in production and leading production, adopting methods of using women instead of men and using the weak instead of the strong in the service industry, and canceling full-time cultural workers. These are all good ways to reduce non-productive personnel and are conducive to the development of commune production.

Will appropriately transferring labor from other fronts to strengthen the agricultural front be detrimental to the work of other fronts? Generally speaking, it will not. Because: First, not every laborer working on other fronts originally was used very rationally or fully played their role. Some things were not arranged well due to lack of experience, wasting some labor. For example, the Fengqiao Commune in Zhuji, Zhejiang, used to concentrate the power machines (pumps) for rice milling in the commune for unified use. Each team needed to carry rice to Fengqiao for milling, and more than 800 laborers were spent on carrying rice every day. Now, the commune has adopted the method of setting up rice milling and processing stations in each management district, and some management districts have rice milling machines touring production teams for processing, which not only makes rice milling more timely and convenient than in the past, but also saves 560 laborers every day. These saved laborers have been put into the agricultural front, which currently needs the most and most urgent labor. It can be seen that transferring out the labor that was originally improperly used will not only not affect the original work, but also better exert the role of each laborer. Second, other undertakings should be sorted out by distinguishing between importance and urgency; this is beneficial to the overall undertaking. Some undertakings that should be retained have gained some experience in the past few months, the staff's skills have become proficient, and some tool reforms have been carried out. They already have the conditions and possibilities to complete the tasks better with less manpower. Taking people out will not affect the development of these undertakings. Third, cadres should participate in production. Cadres who are divorced from production cannot deeply discover the situations and problems in production, cannot lead production expertly, and cannot connect with the masses more closely. Therefore, having cadres participate in production will not only not weaken these aspects of work, but will greatly facilitate the improvement of these aspects of work.

In short, it is both necessary and feasible to transfer labor from other undertakings to strengthen the agricultural front at present; this is to ensure the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    加强主攻战线
    曾志
    最近，许多人民公社都采取了一项重要的措施：从工业、副业生产和其他事业方面，抽调了大批劳动力加强农业战线。这正像战场上在一定情况下集中优势兵力加强主攻方面一样，对于取得全局的胜利是有决定意义的。
    目前，正是春耕大忙时期。今年能不能完成和超额完成更大跃进的粮棉指标，能不能使油、麻、畜牧业等增产得更多更好，首要关键就在于春耕生产能不能搞好。要搞好春耕生产，首先要解决劳动力不足和生产任务繁重的矛盾。工具改革是解决这个矛盾的一个办法；合理安排和使用劳动力，是又一个办法。所谓合理安排和使用劳动力，就是要把每个劳动力使用在最需要的地方，俗话说：“钢要使在刀刃上”，就是这个意思。不但要把每个劳动力使用在最需要的地方，而且，要使每个劳动力能够最大限度地发挥作用。现在，在人民公社的各条战线之中，农业生产可以说是“刀刃”。因为“一年之计在于春”，春耕生产时机紧迫，稍纵即逝。必须紧紧把握住春耕春种时机，用最大的力量保证春耕播种任务完成得又快又好。
    人民公社是应生产发展的需要而产生的，它的巩固和提高，也有赖于生产的不断发展。因此，人民公社要以极大的注意力来关心发展生产的问题，要集中一切力量来发展生产。从劳动力的使用这方面来说，原则应该是力求使所有的劳动力都投入生产，尽量减少非直接生产人员，如脱产干部、服务业人员、文教工作人员等。现在，有些公社各级管理干部都参加生产领导生产，在服务业中采取了以女代男、以弱代强的办法，并且取消了脱产的文化工作人员，这些都是减少非生产人员的好办法，都有利于公社生产的发展。
    从其他战线适当抽调劳动力加强农业战线，会不会不利于其他战线的工作？一般地说，是不会的。因为：第一、原来在其他战线上工作的劳动力，并不是每一个都使用得很合理，都充分发挥了作用，其中有些事情由于没有经验，安排得不好，浪费了一部分劳动力。比如浙江诸暨枫桥公社过去把碾米的动力机（抽水机）集中在公社统一使用，各个队碾米都需要把米挑运到枫桥去碾，每天仅仅花在挑运食米上的劳动力就有八百多个。现在，公社采取了在各管理区分设碾米加工站，有些管理区的碾米机下生产队巡回加工的办法，就不但使碾米比过去及时了方便了，而且每天还节省出五百六十个劳动力。这些节省出来的劳动力，都投入了当前需要劳力最多最急的农业战线。可见，把原来使用不当的劳动力抽调出来，不仅不会影响原来的工作，而且可以更好地发挥每个劳动力的作用。第二、其他事业，应该分清轻重缓急进行整顿；这对整体的事业是有利的。该保留的一些事业，几个月来已经取得了一些经验，工作人员的技术也熟练了，也进行了一些工具改革，已经有条件、有可能用较少的人力，把任务完成得更好。抽出人来，也不会影响到这些事业的发展。第三、干部本来就应当参加生产。干部脱离生产，就不能深入地发现生产中的情况和问题，不能内行地领导生产，不能更密切地联系群众。因此，要干部参加生产，不但不会削弱这些方面的工作，而且会大大有利于这些方面的工作的改进。
    总之，目前从其他事业中抽调劳动力加强农业战线，是既必要又可行；这样做是为了确保实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
