Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Public opinion from various countries around the world has unanimously condemned the bilateral military agreements signed by the United States with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan.

    The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" commented on March 8th that the ruling cliques of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, while colluding with American imperialism behind the backs of their own people, hypocritically claim that their starting point is to care about "protecting" their own "independence." But this mask cannot deceive anyone. In fact, the rulers of these countries signed agreements with the United States out of fear of their own people. It is no accident that the Ankara Agreement grants the United States the right to armed intervention in the internal affairs of these three countries.

    But there is no doubt that foreign bayonets will not help those rulers who directly betray national interests.

    "Pravda" emphasized that the Soviet Union is deeply concerned about maintaining peace, especially peace near its borders, but it cannot ignore the imperialist conspiracy to intensify the situation in the Middle East. "Pravda" concluded by writing that the Soviet people, enraged by these conspiracies, resolutely support their government. The Soviet government has warned the participants in these aggressive agreements that they bear full responsibility for further exacerbating the situation in the region.

    The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on March 6th, calling on all levels of organizations of the Communist Party of India to mobilize the broad masses of patriotic and peace-loving people to participate in the protest rallies and demonstrations scheduled for March 22nd.

    The statement said that the purpose of these bilateral military agreements is to intensify the "Cold War" and pose a new threat to the freedom and independence of the Asian people.

    The statement demanded that the Indian government issue a serious warning to the U.S. government, rather than "taking a complacent attitude towards this issue" and not "relying too much on American guarantees."

    Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, reiterated at a press conference held in New Delhi on March 8th that the Communist Party of India strongly opposes the bilateral military agreement signed between the United States and Pakistan and is very concerned about this dangerous development.

    He said that the United States is playing a double-faced policy towards India. It is not the first time that the United States has said one thing to India and another to Pakistan.

    He said that, of course, the Indian people are willing to be friendly with the American and Pakistani people, but Pakistan, with the support of the United States, is carrying out military preparations under the pretext of "aggression from India." He also said that Pakistan used American weapons in border disputes between India and Pakistan.

    He said that it is appropriate for the Indian government not to trust empty promises and should lodge a serious protest, indicating that the US-Pakistan bilateral military agreement is unfriendly to India.

    The Karachi newspaper "Combat" published an editorial on March 7th, saying that signing a bilateral military agreement with the United States may bring dangerous consequences to Pakistan.

    The newspaper pointed out that the United States wants to involve Pakistan in the international Cold War and lose the peace of mind that remains. The newspaper said, "Involving oneself in the Cold War is by no means a smart policy. Therefore, this treaty, which may lead to Pakistan's involvement in the Cold War, is by no means a pleasant thing."

    The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on March 7th, pointing out that this is another criminal act of sowing the seeds of aggression and war in Asia and threatening peace. It said, "The U.S. aggressor groups are using Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan as springboards and tools for aggressive activities against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and threatening the security and sovereignty of peace-loving countries such as India and Iraq."

    The commentary said: "Today, no foreign aggressor troops should be stationed in any Asian country. No Asian country or region should become a base for U.S. aggressor troops' atomic weapons."

    The Baghdad newspaper "Al-Zaman" said on March 7th, "The U.S. imperialists' signing of these bilateral military agreements is a new provocative action against the cause of world peace. The signing of these military agreements, which have been strongly opposed, will increase tensions in the Middle East and intensify the Cold War throughout the world."

    The Beirut evening newspaper "Al-Sharq" pointed out in a commentary on March 6th that the current governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan are being used by U.S. imperialism as tools to launch aggression and psychological warfare against Middle Eastern countries, "just as the imperialists are using Israel for the same purpose and to combat the liberation movement of the Arab East for independence."

    The Cairo newspaper "Al-Masaa" commented on March 7th that the imperialists want to replace the already fragmented Baghdad Pact by concluding these agreements. It is clear that this is a new step in the imperialist conspiracy in the Middle East.

    美国威胁和平的又一犯罪行动
    各国舆论痛斥美国同土、巴、伊签订军事协定
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：世界各国的公众舆论，一致谴责美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定。
    苏联“真理报”8日评论说，土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦的统治集团一面瞒着本国人民同美帝国主义勾结，一面又假仁假义地说什么他们的出发点是关心“保护”本国的“独立”。但这种假面具是欺骗不了任何人的。事实上，这些国家的统治者由于害怕本国人民才同美国签订协定。安卡拉协定给予美国武装干涉这三个国家的内政的权利不是偶然的。
    但是毫无疑问，外国的刺刀无助于那些直接出卖民族利益的统治者。
    “真理报”强调指出，苏联深切地关心维护和平，特别是在自己边境附近的和平，但是它不能对帝国主义加剧中近东局势的阴谋置之不理。“真理报”最后写道，被这些阴谋激怒的苏联人民坚决拥护自己的政府。苏联政府曾经警告过这些侵略协定的参加者，进一步加剧这个地区局势的全部责任都由他们承担。
    印度共产党全国委员会书记处6日发表声明，号召印度共产党各级组织动员广大爱国的和爱好和平的人民参加定于3月22日举行的抗议大会和示威游行。
    声明说，这些双边军事协定的目的是要加剧“冷战”，并且对亚洲人民的自由和独立造成新的威胁。
    声明要求印度政府向美国政府提出严重的警告，而不要“对这个问题采取高枕无忧的态度”，并且不要“过多地信赖美国的保证”。
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士8日在新德里举行的记者招待会上重申，印度共产党强烈反对美国同巴基斯坦签订双边军事协定，并且十分关心这种危险的事态的发展。
    他说，美国对印度玩弄着两面政策，美国一方面对印度说这样的话，而另一方面对巴基斯坦又说那样的话，这已经不是第一次了。
    他说，当然，印度人民愿意同美国人民和巴基斯坦人民友好，但是巴基斯坦在美国支持下以“来自印度的侵略”为借口，进行着军事准备。他又说，在印度和巴基斯坦边界纠纷中，巴基斯坦使用了美国的武器。
    他说，印度政府不信赖空头保证是适当的，并且应该提出严重的抗议，表明美巴双边军事协定对印度是不友好的。
    卡拉奇“战斗报”7日发表社论说，同美国签订双边军事协定，可能给巴基斯坦带来危险的后果。
    这家报纸指出，美国是要使巴基斯坦卷入国际冷战中和失却所剩下的心境安宁。报纸说，“把自己卷入冷战，绝不是一个聪明的政策。因此，这个可能导致巴基斯坦卷入冷战的条约绝不是一件愉快的事情。”
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”7日发表评论指出，这是在亚洲散播侵略和战争的种子，威胁和平的又一个犯罪行动。它说，“美国侵略集团把土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦三国当做侵略活动的跳板和工具，来反对苏联等社会主义国家，并且威胁印度、伊拉克等爱好和平国家的安全和主权。”
    评论说：“今天，在任何一个亚洲国家都不应驻有外国侵略军队。亚洲的任何一个国家和地区都不得成为美国侵略军队的原子武器基地。”
    巴格达“时代报”7日说，“美帝国主义者签订这些双边军事协定，是对世界和平事业发动了新的挑衅行动。这些一直遭到竭力反对的军事协定的签订势将增加中东的紧张局势和加剧全世界的冷战。”
    贝鲁特晚报“东方报”6日在一篇评论中指出，土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦目前的政府被美帝国主义当作对中东国家发动侵略和神经战的工具，“正像帝国主义分子为了同样的目的和为了打击阿拉伯东方争取独立的解放运动而利用以色列一样”。
    开罗“晚报”7日评论说，帝国主义者想通过缔结这些协定来代替已经支离破碎的巴格达条约。很明显，这是帝国主义在中东进行阴谋的新的一步。
