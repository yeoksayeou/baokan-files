A Vivid Lesson
　　The bell rang for the end of class. After Mr. An finished his lecture, he said to everyone: “Next period's metalworking class will be about iron smelting, and the classroom will be at the Steel Union….” Before he could finish his words, he was immediately drowned out by a burst of enthusiastic laughter.

　　Going to the Steel Union for class, what an enticing and happy event! Looking back half a year, during those days and nights of intense battle, these young people used their own hands and sweat to overcome many difficulties and build the Tianjin University Steel Joint Enterprise. Today, they are going there again for class. How could they not be excited!

　　At two o'clock, everyone gathered in the simple dining hall next to the small blast furnace. Before Mr. Xu began his lecture, he first drew a schematic diagram of the small blast furnace and its auxiliary equipment on the blackboard. Although this diagram was simple, it evoked many memories for people. The small blast furnace, hot blast stove, dust collector... immediately appeared before their eyes. During the lecture, everyone listened with great interest, and some even took detailed notes.

　　As soon as the lecture was over, everyone went to the small blast furnace to visit the site. Everyone carefully observed and touched it from top to bottom, from all around to the inner wall. Some people kept asking their classmates and teachers about problems they had not yet understood.

　　On the way back, everyone talked freely about their feelings and gains. Many people said: This teaching method is too effective. It not only makes theoretical knowledge easy to accept, but also deepens students' understanding and memory of theoretical knowledge. Some students also said: "The content that the teacher lectured on in the classroom made a deeper impression after visiting the site."

    生动的一课
    下课铃响了。安先生结束了他的讲课后，对大家说：“下节金工讲炼铁，课堂在钢联……。”他的话音未落，马上被一阵热烈的欢笑声淹没了。
    到钢联上课去，这是多么诱人的喜事啊！回顾半年前，在那紧张战斗的日日夜夜里，这些年轻的人们用自己的双手和汗水，战胜了重重困难，建成了天津大学钢铁联合企业，今天又要到那里去上课，怎么不兴奋呢！
    两点钟，大家聚集在小高炉旁的简易饭厅里。徐先生讲课前，先在黑板上画了个小高炉及其附属设备的示意图，这图形虽然简单，但却引起人们的很多回忆。小高炉、热风炉、除尘器……马上浮现在人们的眼前。在讲的过程中，每个人都听得津津有味，有人还重点地记着笔记。
    课一讲完，大家便到小高炉前参观现场。大家从上到下，从四周到内壁都仔细地观察着，摸着，有的人还不断向同学和老师询问着自己尚未弄懂的问题。
    回来的路上，大家畅谈着自己的感受和收获。很多人说：这样的教学方法太顶用了，它不仅使理论知识容易接受，而且使同学加深了对理论知识的理解和记忆。也有的同学说：“先生在课堂上讲的内容，经过现场参观后印象更深了。”
