    Drama is in What is Unspoken
    Su Fang
    I recently had the opportunity to see the French film "The Red Balloon," which was quite enlightening. This is a children's film, and I think children will be happy to see films like "The Red Balloon." Because they, especially young children, are different from adults. They are not good at attentively listening to the dialogues of characters with their ears, and they hope to understand the plot more with their eyes.
    "The Red Balloon" meets their requirements in terms of having few dialogues.
    Will fewer dialogues reduce the appeal of the film and make it without "drama"? Obviously not. "The Red Balloon" has very few dialogues, almost none, but it perfectly expresses a story. It personifies the red balloon that cannot speak or think, and portrays it as so characteristic and so精灵可爱 [I am leaving this in Chinese since it means cute and clever, but it does not come across right in English], attracting not only children but also adults! This reminds me of the opening and ending scenes in the film "Rome, 11 O'Clock." The opening scene is: young Gianna sits in front of a building, dozing off, holding a newspaper with an advertisement for a typist position. The ending scene is still Gianna sitting alone in front of that building, drowsy. The difference is that the opening scene takes place in the morning, and Gianna is waiting there to be ahead of the women seeking jobs; the last scene takes place in the evening, because a tragedy has occurred, the typist position is still vacant, so Gianna is still waiting there, hoping to get that position. These two scenes also have very little dialogue, but they profoundly reflect the tragic situation of capitalist society, the urgent desire of poor people to seek employment, and the girl's naive and almost childish fantasies. They also show that "silence" also "has drama."
    What I mean by saying this is not to advocate that the dialogue in films should be as little as possible. The reasons for "drama" are multifaceted and do not depend solely on the amount of dialogue; moreover, essential and artistically charming dialogues that can help to show the character of characters and enhance the dramatic effect are even more welcome. I just hope that the dialogues should be more refined, and should be said at the crucial moments; do not just annotate every move of the characters. Unnecessary, mediocre, and numerous dialogues not only annoy the audience, but also hinder the actors from creating roles. Because in real life, people are always thinking, and it is impossible to talk endlessly. If actors are required to keep talking all the time, how can they understand the content of the conversation with each other, how can they carry out inner emotional communication, and then better delve into the character and create the role? They can only stay at the stage of "reciting lines" forever. In this case, "silence" may be more "dramatic."

    戏在不言中
    苏方
    最近有机会看到法国影片“红气球”，很有些启发。这是一部儿童影片，我想，孩子们一定乐于看像“红气球”这样的影片。因为他们，特别是幼小的儿童们，跟成人不一样，不大善于用耳朵凝神专注地谛听人物的对话，更多希望的是用眼睛看懂故事情节。
    “红气球”在对话少这方面是符合他们的要求的。
    对话少，是不是就会削减影片的感染力，使得影片没有“戏”了呢？很显然，不会。“红气球”的对话少到几乎没有，但是它却相当完美地表现了一个故事。它把那个不会说话、也不会思想的红气球人格化了，把它描绘得那么有性格，那么精灵可爱，不但吸引住了孩子，也吸引住了成人！这使人想起影片
  “罗马十一点钟”里开头和结尾的两段戏。开头一段是：年青的基安娜坐在一幢房子前面打瞌睡，手里拿着登有招考打字员的广告的报纸。结尾一段戏，仍是基安娜独自一人坐在那座房子前昏然欲睡。不同的是，开头一段戏的时间是清晨，基安娜为了要抢先排在求职的妇女们的前面在那儿等候；最后一段戏的时间在傍晚，因为发生过一幕惨剧，那个打字员的位置还空着，所以基安娜仍然候在那里，希望能取得那个位置。这两段戏也没有多少对话，然而它们却极深刻地反映了资本主义社会的悲惨状况，反映了穷困的人们寻求职业的急迫心情，也反映了这个姑娘天真得近乎幼稚的幻想。它们也说明了“无言”同样“有戏”。
    说这些的意思，并不是在提倡：电影的对话应该愈少愈好。“有戏”的原因是多方面的，并不单纯取决于对话的多少；而且精华的、富有艺术魅力的对话，能够帮助展示人物性格，加强戏剧效果，更是应该拍手欢迎。我只是希望：对话应该更精炼些，应该说在节骨眼上；不要只是在为人物的一举一动作注释。可有可无的、平庸而又繁多的对话，不但使观众听起来着恼，也会妨碍演员创造角色。因为在实际生活中，人总是经常在思考的，不可能喋喋不休地说个不完。如果要求演员老是不停地讲话，他们彼此如何能够理解谈话的内容，如何能够进行内心情感交流，进而更好地深入角色创造角色呢？他们只能永远停留在“背台词”的阶段上。在这种情况下，“无言”恐怕倒会“有戏”一些了。
