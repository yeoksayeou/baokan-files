I Will Always Love Nursing
    ——Remembering Bi Huaying, Head Nurse of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital
    By our reporter Liu Peiheng
    The rising sun had just shone into the ward of the trauma and orthopedics department. The nurse on the night shift hadn't gotten off work yet, and head nurse Bi Huaying had already arrived. She first gently entered the room of the paraplegic and seriously ill patients, walking to each patient's bedside to greet them kindly:
      “Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere? Did you sleep well last night?”
    Sometimes, before she could finish speaking, the patients would rush to tell her about their conditions, even telling her how many apples they had eaten. Suddenly, a long sigh of "Ah!" came from the crack of another room's door. She immediately thought it must be the rural girl suffering from a compression fracture of the lumbar vertebra who was sad again. She went over to take a look, and the girl's face was indeed covered in tears. She took out her handkerchief to wipe the girl's tears, stroked the patient's hair, and told the story of the "Flying Hero without Feet." When Bi Huaying walked into another ward, a middle-aged patient was asking the patient in the next bed, "Is the commissary open?" She immediately understood that the patient wanted to eat fruit. She immediately picked up the telephone and called the commissary to ask them to deliver the fruit to this ward. Some patients often said with emotion: "The head nurse and the patients are really connected heart to heart!"
    One day after dusk, an operation room sent over a burn patient. Bi Huaying greeted him, and saw that beneath his thick eyebrows, a pair of dull eyes were deeply hidden, and only a layer of skin covered the bones of his face. She immediately thought of the patient's malnutrition, which would affect the healing of his wounds. When she learned that the patient was a worker sent from Zhangjiakou who had shed blood for the country's socialist construction, she not only personally fed him every day, but also instructed the other nurses to take extra careful care of him. The patient's wound constantly oozed blood, pus, and exudate, often soaking the bandages, dressings, and sheets, causing the room to exude an unpleasant odor. Bi Huaying was afraid that the young nurses would not be used to it, so she often stayed in this ward herself. When they changed the patient's sheets, they were always careful to lift the patient gently and change to dry sheets, fearing that they would touch the painful areas of the wound. Bi Huaying also carefully calculated the amount of exudate and urine excreted by the patient every day, as well as how much water he drank and how many eggs he ate, to see if it was enough for his nutritional needs. However, burn patients did not like to eat a lot of things. She stood in front of the patient's bed, patiently persuading him again and again. "Drink a sip of milk! Eat another bite of egg, eat more and you will get well faster..." The patient opened his eyes and looked at Bi Huaying's kind face, not wanting to disappoint her good intentions, so he ate a little more. After several months of care by Bi Huaying and other nurses, the worker recovered his health and returned to his job.
    Bi Huaying is a good head nurse praised by patients and a role model for young nurses to learn from. In the wards of this hospital, her exemplary behavior deeply influences young nurses. Ge Wenhua used to be a girl who was not at ease with her nursing job. She worked with head nurse Bi Huaying for a long time, and often heard Bi Huaying talk about her thirty years of nursing experience, and the connection between nursing work and socialist construction, which slowly made her understand the meaning of nursing work. Once, a seriously ill patient wanted to eat cold mixed vegetables, adding only salt without vinegar one moment, and then only vinegar without salt the next. The head nurse changed it for the patient again and again, which deeply moved Ge Wenhua. She remembered that the head nurse often said to her: "We must see patients as our own relatives, and we will not dislike being dirty or tired. Seeing the builders of socialism that we personally care for leave the hospital healthy, we will feel even greater happiness and comfort." Ge Wenhua thought of these things, saw these things, and with the constant education of the Party, she strengthened her sense of career. From then on, Ge Wenhua's work attitude changed, and some patients praised her for being like the head nurse's "apprentice."
    Why does Bi Huaying love her work so much? During the great debate on the future of nurses in Jishuitan Hospital, she answered this question with her thirty years of nursing experience. Bi Huaying had worked as a nurse in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Donghua Hospital, Kailuan Hospital and other hospitals for twenty years in her early years. In the era of reactionary rule, bureaucratic landlords lived in hospitals and regarded nurses as "high-class maids," suffering endless grievances with nowhere to complain. For the sake of life and fear of losing her job, she did not dare to marry. After liberation, her life completely changed. She got married at the age of forty-six and lived a happy life in her later years. She wrote on a big-character poster: "I like nursing work very much because nursing work is important. Patients cannot leave nurses for a moment. We take good care of wounded and sick comrades, so that they can return to their jobs, which is equivalent to us adding strength to the cause of socialism."

    我永远热爱护士工作
    ——记北京市积水潭医院护士长毕华英
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    初升的太阳刚刚射进创伤骨科的病房里，值夜班的护士还没下班，护士长毕华英就来了，她先轻轻地走进截瘫重病人的房间，走到每个病人的床前亲切地问候：
      “有哪儿不舒服吗？夜里睡的好吗？”
    有时，不等她说完，病人就抢先向她述说自己的病情，甚至吃了几个苹果也都告诉她。忽然，从另一个房间的门缝传出了“唉！”的长叹声。她立刻想到准是患腰椎压缩骨折的农村姑娘又伤心了，走过去一看，这位姑娘果然满脸泪痕。她拿起手帕为姑娘擦眼泪，摩抚着病人的头发，讲起“无脚飞英雄”的故事。当毕华英又走进另一个病房时，一个中年病人在询问邻床的病友：“小卖部开门没有？”她立即会意病人想吃水果。马上拿起电话机叫通小卖部请把水果送到这个病房来。有的病人常常感动地说：“护士长和病人真是心连着心啊！”
    一天黄昏后，手术室送来一个烧伤的病人。毕华英迎上去，只见这个人浓眉下面，深藏着一对无神的眼睛，脸上仅有一层皮包着骨头，她立刻想到病人的营养不良，会影响到伤口的愈合。当她知道患者是从张家口送来的一个工人，为祖国的社会主义建设流了血。她不仅每天亲自喂他饭，还嘱咐其他护士要对他特别细心地护理。这个病人伤口不断流出血、脓和渗出液，经常湿透了绷带、敷料和床单，使屋子里散发出一股难嗅的臭味。毕华英怕青年护士不习惯，自己常常守在这个病房里。当她们给病人换床单时，生怕触到伤口的疼处，总是轻轻抬起病人换好干燥的床单。毕华英每天还仔细的计算病人流出的渗出液和排泄的尿量，以及喝了多少水和吃了几个鸡蛋，看看是否够营养量。可是烧伤病人却不喜欢多吃东西。她就站在病人的床前，一遍又一遍耐心地劝说。喝口牛奶吧！再吃一口鸡蛋，多吃点病就好的快了……”病人睁开眼睛看看毕华英那副亲切的面孔，不好辜负她的好意，就再吃一点，经过毕华英和其他护士几个月的护理，这个工人恢复了健康，重新走上了工作岗位。
    毕华英是病人称赞的好护士长，也是青年护士学习的榜样。在这个医院的病房里，她的模范行为深深地影响着青年护士。葛文华以前就是一个不安心护士工作的姑娘，她和护士长毕华英在一起工作长了，时常听到毕华英讲述三十年护士生活的经历，讲护士工作和社会主义建设工作的联系，慢慢使她理解到护士工作的意义。有一次，一个重病人要吃拌凉菜，一会儿只加盐不加醋，一会儿，又光加醋不加盐，护士长就一次又一次的给病人换。使葛文华深深地受到了感动。她想起护士长经常对她说：“我们要把病人看成是自己的亲人，就不会嫌脏嫌累，看到亲手照顾的社会主义建设者健康地走出医院，我们会感到更大的幸福和安慰”。葛文华想到这些，看到这些，又加上党的不断教育，才坚定了自己的事业心。从此，葛文华的工作态度变了，有的病人称赞她真像护士长的“徒弟”。
    毕华英为什么这样热爱自己的工作呢？在积水潭医院开展关于护士前途问题大鸣大放大辩论时，她以三十年的护士生活的经历回答了这个问题。毕华英早年曾在协和医院、东华医院、开滦医院等医院当了二十年的护士。在反动统治的年代里，官僚地主住医院，把护士看成“高级老妈子”，受尽委曲也没处去说理。为了生活怕失业，她不敢结婚，解放后，她的生活才彻底变了样。她在四十六岁那一年也结了婚，过着晚年的幸福生活。她在一张大字报上这样写道：我很喜欢护士工作，因为护士工作重要。病人没有一时一刻可以离开护士。我们把伤、病的同志护理好，使他们重回工作岗位，就等于我们对社会主义事业增加了力量。”
