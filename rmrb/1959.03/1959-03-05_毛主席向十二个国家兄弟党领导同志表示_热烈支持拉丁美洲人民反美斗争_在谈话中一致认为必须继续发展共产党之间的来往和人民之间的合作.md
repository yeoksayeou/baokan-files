Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th - Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the 3rd, met with the leaders of the brotherly parties of twelve Latin American countries who recently came to China for a visit, and had warm and friendly talks with them. The comrades of the brotherly parties of these twelve countries are: Luis Corvalán, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chile; Pompeyo Márquez, Central Secretary of the Communist Party of Venezuela, Political Bureau members Pedro Ortega Díaz, Alonso Ojeda Olaechea, Central Committee member Guillermo Guevara; Gilberto Vieira, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Colombia, Political Bureau member Joaquín Moreno Guaracas; Raúl Acosta, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Peru, Central Committee member Jorge Del Prado; Elías Muñoz, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Ecuador; Humberto Ramírez, member of the Central Political Committee of the Communist Party of Bolivia; Felipe Pesse Rotnic, Secretary of the Central Finance Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina; Wilfredo Velásquez, Organizational Secretary of the Las Villas Provincial Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, and representatives of the Communist Party of Brazil, the Communist Party of Paraguay, the People's Vanguard Party of Costa Rica, and the People's Party of Panama.

Participating in the meeting and talks were: Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.

Chairman Mao Zedong exchanged views with the leaders of the above-mentioned fraternal parties on the current international situation and unanimously agreed that the current world situation is extremely favorable to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, independence, democracy and social progress. The reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism were disintegrating, while the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the revolutionary and peace-loving democratic forces of the world are surging forward with unstoppable momentum. In the talks, it was unanimously agreed that as long as the people of all countries continue to maintain unity, remain vigilant, and strive for struggle, if imperialism launches a world war of aggression, it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat, and the just cause of the people of the world will surely achieve final victory.

When talking about the situation in Latin America, they all unanimously and satisfiedly pointed out that recently the patriotic sentiments of the people of all Latin American countries have grown unprecedentedly. It is an inevitable trend of historical development that the people of all Latin American countries get rid of the control of U.S. imperialism and achieve complete independence. Chairman Mao Zedong expressed warm sympathy and support for the resolute opposition of the people of Latin American countries to U.S. imperialism, defending national independence and striving for democratic freedom, and expressed heartfelt congratulations to the revolutionary victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the reactionary pro-American autocratic government.

The leaders of the brotherly parties of Latin American countries talked about the great achievements they had seen in China's socialist construction, and believed that these achievements greatly helped the Latin American people in their struggle for independence, democracy, social progress, and world peace. They expressed the sympathy and support of the Latin American people for the Chinese people and thanked the Communist Party of China for inviting them to visit China and the warm hospitality. Chairman Mao Zedong expressed gratitude for the warm concern of the leaders of the Latin American brotherly parties for the Chinese revolution and construction.

In the talks, it was unanimously agreed that, in order to defend the cause of world peace, national independence, democracy and social progress, it is necessary to continue to develop exchanges between the Communist Parties of Latin American countries and the Communist Party of China in order to facilitate the development of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Latin American countries and the Chinese people.
