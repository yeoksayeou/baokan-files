    A Journey Through the Hengduan Mountains
    Our correspondent in Yunnan
    A production upsurge has begun in the Hengduan Mountain area of Yunnan. We began our long journey from Nushan in the northwestern part of the Hengduan Mountains. The mountain tops here are covered with snow, and the north wind is howling. No matter how cold the weather, it cannot stop people's soaring ambitions. Tens of thousands of Lisu and Nu people, in order to achieve greater victories on the production front this year than in 1958, brave the wind and snow to dig Coptis chinensis on the mountains, collect fertilizer, build water conservancy projects, and build roads.
    At a water conservancy and road construction site at an altitude of 4,000 meters, thousands of Lisu and Nu migrant workers have set up camps on the mountainside. They are building a road across Nushan to connect the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture with inland Yunnan. While building the road, a canal was dug to divert snow water from Nushan to irrigate thousands of acres of farmland in Bijiang County. When the project progressed to the top of the mountain, it was the time of heavy snow. In order to get the snow water to flow into the fields as soon as possible, and to get the cars to the frontier as soon as possible, each team launched a competition to see who could win the red flag in the "Snow Mountain Assault Battle."
    Traveling south along the Nujiang River valley, after crossing countless mountains, we arrived at Baoshan County in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. Here is a completely different scene. Who would have thought that while it was still snowing heavily on the high mountains, cotton had already begun to be sown in the valley below? The Han, Dai, and Benglong ethnic groups here are rushing to plant cotton. In order to change the extensive farming habits of the past, they require: flat fields and fine soil, to ensure that the seedlings emerge evenly, and implemented two plowing and two harrowing for all cotton fields. They organized more than 1,300 cattle to carry out deep plowing and fine harrowing. By January 29, the cotton fields had been harrowed. The person in charge of the Baoshan County Committee said that in order to ensure the state's cotton supply, they will plant more than 70,000 mu of cotton this year, an increase of nearly double compared to last year, and the sowing will be a month earlier than last year.
    In 1957, we visited a cotton experimental station on the banks of the Nujiang River. Although cotton can be planted here all year round, they are still studying when it is most suitable to plant cotton in this subtropical region. According to the experiments of the past few years, planting the first crop of cotton early in winter is an important measure to ensure increased cotton production, because the rainy season comes early and the rainfall is heavy in the Baoshan area. Spring sowing of cotton coincides with the rainy season when the cotton bolls are forming and spitting out, and many cotton bolls are lost. This year, they are sowing a month earlier, so that the boll formation and spitting can avoid the rainy season and ensure a bumper harvest. It can also be harvested earlier and harvest a second crop of regenerated cotton.
    From Baoshan to Dali, although it is only a two-day journey, it is another scene. Heavy snow is falling on Cangshan Mountain, but the peach blossoms and cherry blossoms by the Erhai Lake at the foot of Cangshan Mountain are in full bloom.
    The Bai people living in such a beautiful place have even greater enthusiasm this year. In the first month, they achieved a good start, overfulfilling the production tasks of steel, iron, copper, and light industry, and also using indigenous methods to manufacture small rolling mills in batches.
    There are many copper mines in the remaining veins of the Yunling Mountains. Bai and other ethnic workers use various indigenous machines to mine and select ores in the mountain streams. The sound of horses' hooves is broken in the mountains, and teams of caravans and ox carts transport the ores from the mountain post roads hidden in the clouds to the copper smelters. The Gonglang Copper Mine in Weishan Yi Autonomous County and the Changjie Copper Mine in Yongping County have realized vehicle transportation, the transportation efficiency of ore has increased by two times, and the daily output of copper has increased by more than one time. The entire Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture completed the task for January in only twenty days. The copper produced in this month is equal to more than half of last year's output, and the quality has also improved compared to last year.
    In the cities and villages of the Bai people on the Erhai Lake, one of the most prominent impressions is the abundance of light industrial products and chemical industrial products. The deputy director of the Autonomous Prefecture's Industrial and Vice Bureau told us: The Autonomous Prefecture's sugarcane production more than doubled last year. Now is the season for sugar extraction. In the plains of Jianchuan, Heqing, and other counties, people's communes have established more than 300 comprehensive factories for sugar extraction, winemaking, alcohol production, papermaking, and fertilizer production. As a result of the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane, sugar, alcohol, and paper are all available.
    Following the Honghe River from Erhai Lake, we came to the Yuanjiang Dam in the Ailao Mountains. When we crossed Nushan Mountain, we were wearing leather coats. After arriving here, we only wore a shirt in the morning. Who would have thought it was winter? The banana gardens are full of fresh bananas, and the blood-red Bauhinia are in full bloom. When we visited the Honghe People's Commune, we also saw mature rice in an experimental field of the Agricultural Science Research Institute, while the commune was busy transplanting early rice; some cotton was spitting out cotton. In other fields, people were sowing. Li Hongyuan, deputy director of the Honghe People's Commune, said: "Plants are not restricted by the season here. They can be planted and harvested all year round."
    Such a natural environment is truly blessed. However, it also brings people busyness. Duan Yuhua, secretary of the Honghe People's Commune Party Committee, said: "We are really busy in winter, harvesting sugarcane, extracting sugar, transplanting early rice, planting cotton, collecting fertilizer... several gongs and drums are playing together. In the past, we could only take care of one thing at a time. Sugarcane was harvested until March when it bloomed, and early rice was not transplanted until after the Spring Festival. Cotton was only planted sporadically. Labor was tight, so we couldn't take care of it! This year, we are advancing side by side and blooming everywhere!" We asked him: "Where does the labor come from?" Secretary Duan said: "From the commune. Our commune has six ethnic groups. Dai, Han, etc. live in the dam area, with few people and a lot of land; Hani, Yi, Bula, Shansu, etc. live in the nearby mountains, with strong labor and little land. Now everyone helps each other and runs canteens and nurseries. Women of all ethnic groups are coming out to do men's work, so there is more labor. Without the establishment of people's communes, we would not be able to take care of it at all this year!"
    As we walked along the Honghe River, through this fertile dam area, a row of chimneys was exposed in the depths of the sugarcane forest. The ancient ox-drawn wooden presses, the water-powered sugar presses created by the masses, and the modern large sugar factories are all busy pressing sugarcane. Although the commune's sugarcane output has more than doubled this year compared to last year, it can be squeezed out in early February; the commune plans to plant 4,500 mu of new cotton, and most of it has been planted. The fields are full of manure pits, and ox carts delivering fertilizer are weaving back and forth; in the mirror-like paddy fields, Dai women are busy transplanting rice seedlings. We walked to a field near Xiaoyan Village and saw a group of Dai women pulling ropes to plant rice seedlings in the field. We asked Feng Shihong, the captain of this production team: "Will this planting method be slower than in the past?"
    "Not slow! In the past, we didn't transplant rice seedlings until after the Spring Festival, but this year we will finish transplanting them by the Spring Festival!"
    "Why did you have to wait until after the Spring Festival to transplant rice seedlings in the past?"
    "One is that the labor force is too busy, and the other is that it is our Dai people's old habit. The old people say: If you transplant rice seedlings before the Spring Festival, you won't have enough to eat. Last year, several of our cadres discussed: Whether we can eat enough or not, let's try it on a few mu. Our experimental field was transplanted five days before the Spring Festival, and with deep plowing, close planting, and more fertilization, one mu of land harvested a total of 4,000 catties of grain in two seasons, while the other fields averaged only 1,600 catties per mu in two seasons. As a result, everyone believed it, and this year they all asked to plant early. The fields that are planted now are imitating our experimental fields last year."
    "How many catties do you plan to produce this year?"
    "An average of 2,000 catties per mu, and strive for 3,000 to 5,000 catties per mu for 700 mu of high-yield fields. The cadres, young people, and women in our team have all planted experimental fields with a target of 10,000 catties per mu." (Attached pictures)

    横断山纪行
    本报驻云南记者
    生产高潮在云南的横断山地带开始了，我们从横断山脉西北部的怒山开始了长途旅行。这里的山顶已积雪皑皑北风呼啸。不管天气多么寒冷，却挡不着人们跃进的雄心，几万个傈僳族人和怒族人为了今年在生产战线上取得比1958年更大的胜利，冒着风雪在山上挖黄连、积肥料、修水利、筑公路。
    在拔海四千公尺的一个水利和筑路工地上，几千个傈僳族和怒族民工在山坡上安营下寨。他们正在修筑一条越过怒山把怒江傈僳族自治州与云南内地联结起来的公路。在修公路的同时，开凿了一条水渠，引怒山上的雪水到山腰去灌溉碧江县的几千亩田地。当工程进行到山顶时，正是大雪纷飞的日子，民工们为了使雪水早日流进田地，为了使汽车早日通到边疆，各队展开了竞赛，看谁在“雪山突击战”中夺得红旗。
    沿怒江河谷南下，也不知翻过多少大山，便到了德宏傣族、景颇族自治州的保山县。这里完全是另一景象，有谁能想到在大山上还大雪纷飞，山下的坝子里又已经开始播种棉花呢？这里的汉族、傣族和崩龙族正在突击种棉。为了改变历年来耕作粗放的习惯，他们要求达到：田平土细，保证小苗出的齐，实行了全部棉田两犁两耙。他们组织了一千三百多头牛来进行深耕细耙，到1月29日棉田已经耙完。保山县委会的负责人说，为了保证国家用棉，他们今年种棉七万多亩，比去年增加将近一倍，播种也比去年早了一个月。
    1957年我们曾来过怒江边一个棉作试验站，在这里虽然一年四季都可以种棉花，但他们还在研究这亚热带地区到底什么时候种棉花合适。根据这几年来的试验证明，提早在冬季种第一季棉花是保证棉花增产的重要措施，因为保山地区雨季来的早，雨量多。春季播种棉花，在结桃吐絮时正值雨季，棉桃损失很多。今年他们提前播种一个月，结桃吐絮就可躲过雨季，确保丰收。还可提早收割，多收一次再生棉。
    从保山到大理，虽然只有两天路程，但又是一番景色了。苍山上正大雪纷飞，苍山脚下洱海边的桃花和樱花却在盛开。
    居住在这样美好地方的白族人民，今年的干劲更大。在头一个月里，他们旗开得胜，超额完成了钢、铁、铜和轻工业的生产任务，还用土办法成批地制造小型轧钢机。
    云岭余脉里的铜矿很多，白族与其他民族的工人，使用各种土机械在山箐里采选矿石，山间马蹄声碎，一队队马帮和牛车从隐藏在云雾中的山间驿道上把矿石源源不断地运到炼铜厂。巍山彝族自治县公郎铜矿和永平县厂街铜矿实现了车子化，矿石的运输工效提高了两倍，铜的日产量提高了一倍多，整个大理白族自治州只有二十天就完成了1月份的任务。这一个月生产的铜等于去年产量的一半多，质量也比去年提高了。
    在洱海边的白族人民的城市和农村里，给人最突出的印象之一是有丰富的轻工业品和化学工业品，自治州工业副局长告诉我们：去年自治州的甘蔗增产了一倍多。现在正是榨糖的季节，在剑川、鹤庆等县的平原里，人民公社办了三百多个榨糖、酿酒、制酒精、造纸、作肥料的综合工厂。甘蔗综合利用的结果，糖、酒精、纸就都有了。
    从洱海沿红河而下，来到了哀牢山中的元江坝。我们翻越怒山时，身上穿着皮大衣，到这里以后，上午只穿一件衬衫。谁能感到这是冬天呢？香蕉园里结满了新鲜的香蕉，血红的攀枝花正在盛开。我们访问红河人民公社时，还看到农业科学研究所的一块试验田里，稻谷已经成熟，而公社里正忙着栽插早稻；有的棉花正在吐絮。其它田里，人们却在播种。红河人民公社副主任李洪元说：“植物在我们这里是不受季节限制的，一年四季可以种，一年四季可以收。”
    这样的自然环境，真是得天独厚。不过，它也给人带来了繁忙，红河人民公社党委书记段毓华说：“我们冬天真忙，收甘蔗、榨糖、栽早稻、种棉花、积肥……几套锣鼓一齐响。往年，顾得这样顾不得那样，甘蔗收到3月份开了花才收完，早稻要过了春节才动手栽，棉花只零星地种点。劳动力紧，顾不上啊！今年才齐头并进，遍地开花！”我们问他：“劳动力从哪里来？”段书记说：“从公社来。我们公社有六种民族，傣族、汉族等住坝子，人少田地多；哈尼、彝、卜拉、山苏等民族住附近山上，劳动力强，田地少。现在大家互相帮助，办起食堂和托儿所。各民族的妇女都出来干男人的活，劳动力就多了。不成立人民公社，今年根本顾不过来！”
    当我们沿着红河，走过了这块富饶的坝子，蔗林深处，露出一排排的烟囱。古老的牛拉木榨，群众创造的水力榨糖机，现代化的大糖厂同时在忙碌地压榨甘蔗。虽然全公社今年甘蔗的产量比去年增加了一倍多，但2月上旬即可榨完；公社计划新植四千五百亩棉花，已栽下大半，田野里到处是粪坑，送肥的牛车往来如织；在平如镜面的水田里，傣族妇女忙着插秧。我们走到小燕村附近的一块田边，看见一群傣族妇女在田里拉着绳子栽秧，我们问这个生产队的队长封世鸿：“这样栽法进度会比往年慢吧？”
    “不慢！往年过了春节才栽秧，今年到春节就栽完啦！”
    “往年为什么要等春节过后才栽秧呢？”
    “一来是劳动力忙不过来，二来是我们傣族老习惯，老人都说：不过春节栽秧不得吃。去年，我们几个干部商量：得吃不得吃，试它几亩吧。我们的试验田在春节前五天栽了秧，加上深耕密植多施肥，一亩田两季共收了四千斤谷子，其它的田平均一亩两季才收一千六百斤。这样一来，大家都相信啦，今年都要求早栽。现在栽的田都仿我们去年的试验田那样。”
    “今年你们准备产多少斤？”
    “平均一亩两千斤，七百亩高产田争取三千到五千斤，我们队里的干部、青年和妇女都种了亩产万斤指标的试验田。”（附图片）
