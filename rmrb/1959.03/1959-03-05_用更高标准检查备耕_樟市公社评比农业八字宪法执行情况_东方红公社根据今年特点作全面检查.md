    Using Higher Standards to Inspect Spring Plowing
    Zhangshi Commune Evaluates the Implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture
    Dongfanghong Commune Conducts a Comprehensive Inspection Based on This Year's Characteristics

    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th) The Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, recently conducted a point-by-point major inspection and evaluation of the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in the current spring plowing and cultivation, pushing the cultivation and preparation movement to a new climax.
    This inspection went deep into each team and the fields, with the purpose of discovering and solving problems, and more strictly implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" to ensure that the yield of early-season grain crops doubles.
    The inspection showed that this year's preparation and cultivation production is faster, better, and earlier than last year, and the five points of the "Eight-Point Charter" that can be implemented according to the season are being carried out earnestly and excellently. For example, the amount of fertilizer accumulated this year is greater and of better quality than last year, with an average of more than 2,500 dan of native miscellaneous fertilizer per mu; more than 16,000 mu of rice fields have been deeply plowed to a depth of more than one foot, and other cultivated land has also been deeply plowed to a depth of seven or eight inches; more than half of the cultivated land has achieved garden-style management and self-flowing irrigation, and the drought resistance capacity of ordinary cultivated land has also exceeded sixty days. The "Eight-Point Charter," which cannot be carried out due to seasonal reasons, such as close planting, field management, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, has also been fully prepared for. However, the inspection also found that the preparation and cultivation work was not balanced enough, and individual teams were not thorough enough in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter." For example, some accumulated less fertilizer, especially refined fertilizer; some sowing was not completely up to specifications; and some poor field management caused seedling deaths. Production teams with these problems humbly accepted the criticism and made up for the deficiencies. More than 30 mu of dry seedlings sown in the Jietan Management Area were washed away by rain because the soil cover was not tight. After the inspection discovered this, the area immediately organized more than 180 people to replant and cover the soil in the rain. The twelve small canals that were buried when schistosomiasis was eliminated in the Matigang Team of the Liukeng Management Area were also discovered and opened in time during this inspection. Some production teams, which had developed a sense of complacency and slackness due to better preparation and cultivation, launched an even greater production upsurge after criticizing complacency and slackness through inspection and evaluation.
    The major inspection and evaluation powerfully promoted spring plowing production. Now, spring plowing production in the Zhangshi Commune is in full swing.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th) The Dongfanghong Commune in the suburbs of Datong City, Shanxi Province, recently dispatched cadres to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the current spring plowing work.
    This inspection, in the spirit of "despising the enemy strategically and valuing the enemy tactically" and "combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis," carefully studied the problems facing spring plowing production this year. There are many things and big tasks in this year's spring plowing production. According to the commune's plan, the grain yield per mu of basic farmland in 1959 should reach 1,000 jin, and with the income from industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the total output value of the entire commune in 1959 should increase from 6,948,000 yuan in 1958 to 13,599,000 yuan. This has brought a series of new tasks and new work to this year's spring plowing production. The commune roughly calculated that there is a shortage of more than 110,000 labor days in spring plowing production before early June. There is a lack of new-style tools, and general agricultural tools are also insufficient. In the past, it was extensive planting and low yield, but this year it is intensive cultivation and meticulous work, so everyone is required to master new technologies. Fertilizers have increased, so how to apply fertilizer reasonably? After close planting, how to make it ventilated and light-transmitting and facilitate field management? All of these should be prepared for.
    Through investigation and research and scientific analysis, it was unanimously believed that the favorable conditions brought about by the Great Leap Forward and communization last year must be fully utilized to make preparations early, and four major countermeasures were studied: (1) In view of the characteristics of many things and big tasks this spring, implement overall arrangements. On the basis of overall ranking, according to the principle of ensuring key points and taking into account general needs, it was decided to focus on grasping fertilizer, preventing drought and preserving soil moisture, breaking up soil and preparing land, and preparing for wheat sowing. (2) In view of the characteristics of the shortage of labor and tools this spring, vigorously grasp tool reform and repair agricultural tools. More than 400 iron and woodworking craftsmen have shifted from engaging in sideline occupations to manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools. (3) In view of the urgent need to master new technologies, mobilize party members and cadres to take the lead in implementing technology learning for all. (4) According to the principle of destruction, construction and retention, strengthen planning, improve the responsibility system, and adapt the commune's management level to greater leaps forward.

    用更高标准检查备耕
    樟市公社评比农业八字宪法执行情况
    东方红公社根据今年特点作全面检查
    本报广州4日电　广东省韶关市郊樟市人民公社，最近对早造备耕、开耕中的农业“八字宪法”的执行情况，进行了逐条大检查大评比，把开耕、备耕运动推向更高潮。
    这次检查深入到每个队和田间，检查的目的在于发现问题解决问题，更严格地贯彻“八字宪法”，确保早造粮食作物产量翻一番。
    检查表明，今年备耕开耕生产比去年做得又快又好又早，“八字宪法”中按照季节目前可以贯彻的五条，条条都做得认真，做得出色。如今年积得的肥料比去年的数量多质量好，现在每亩已平均有土杂肥二千五百担以上；已深翻的稻田中深一尺以上的达一万六千多亩，其他耕地深翻也达七、八寸；一半以上的耕地达到园田化和灌溉自流化，一般耕地的抗旱能力也超过六十天以上。“八字宪法”中，因季节关系目前还不能进行的密植、田间管理、防治病虫害等，也都做了充分的准备。但是，检查中也发现备耕开耕工作不够平衡，个别队在贯彻“八字宪法”时不够彻底。如有的积肥数量少，特别是精肥少；有的播种不完全合乎规格；有的田间管理不善而造成秧苗的死亡。存在这些问题的生产队，都虚心接受，突击补课。解滩管理区播下的三十多亩旱秧，因为盖土不严，种子在下雨时被冲走了。检查发现后，该区立即组织一百八十多人冒雨补播和盖土。留坑管理区马蹄岗队，在消灭血吸虫时被埋掉的十二条小水渠，也在这次检查中发现后及时挖开了。一些因备耕搞得较好而产生自满松劲情绪的生产队，在通过检查评比批判了自满松劲情绪后，掀起了更大的生产高潮。
    大检查大评比有力地推动了春耕生产。现在，樟市公社的春耕生产进行得热火朝天。

    本报太原4日电　山西大同市郊东方红公社最近抽调干部对当前备耕工作全面进行了检查。
    这次检查本着“战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人”和“冲天干劲和科学分析相结合”的精神，细致地研究了今年春耕生产面临着的问题。今年的春耕生产事情多、任务大。按照公社的计划，1959年基本农田的粮食亩产量要达到一千斤，加上工林牧副渔的收入，全公社1959年的总产值要由1958年的六百九十四万八千元增长到一千三百五十九万九千元。这就给今年的春耕生产带来了一系列的新任务和新工作。公社粗略地计算了一下，在6月上旬以前的春耕生产中，缺十一万多个劳动日。新式工具缺乏，一般农具也不足。过去是广种薄收，今年是精耕细作，因此要求人人掌握新技术。肥料增多了，怎样合理施肥？密植后，如何使之通风透光和便于田间管理？所有这些，都应该有所准备。
    通过调查研究和科学的分析，一致认为必须充分运用去年大跃进和公社化后带来的有利条件，早作准备，并研究出四大对策，（1）针对今春事情多、任务大的特点，实行全面安排。在全面排队的基础上，根据保证重点、兼顾一般的原则，决定在当前突出地抓肥料、防旱保墒、碎土整地、小麦播种的准备等。（2）针对今春缺劳力缺工具的特点，大抓工具改革和整修农具。四百多个铁木匠已经由搞副业转到制造和修补农具方面来了。
  （3）针对掌握新技术的迫切要求，发动党员干部带头，实行全民学技术。（4）根据有破有立有存的原则，加强计划性，健全责任制，使公社的管理水平与更大的跃进相适应。（附图片）
