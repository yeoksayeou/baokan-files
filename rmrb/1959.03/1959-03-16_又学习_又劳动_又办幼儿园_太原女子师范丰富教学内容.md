    Studying, Laboring, and Running Kindergartens
    Taiyuan Women's Normal School Enriches Teaching Content
    (Our dispatch) Taiyuan Women's Normal School in Shanxi Province organized teachers and students to go deep into rural areas and streets. They participated in labor, assisted communes and streets in running kindergartens, and conducted on-site teaching, gaining a lot.
    More than 350 teachers and students from this school formed 27 groups and were sent to several rural people's communes and streets last December. In addition to participating in labor, they also, with the support of the local Party committees, assisted people's communes and streets in setting up 109 kindergartens, enrolling more than 4,000 children, and training 940 childcare workers, enabling more than 2,300 women to participate in labor.
    In the activities of labor training and running kindergartens, the students personally experienced the importance of early childhood education, greatly improving their political awareness and consolidating their professional thinking. In the past, more than 90% of the students in one class of the first grade were not at ease with their studies. Now, 99% of the students are highly motivated to study. They expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to this noble cause and cultivate communist successors for the motherland. They actively invested in kindergarten activities, using scraps of cloth to sew cloth dolls for the children and using waste materials to make teaching aids and toys. Many students personally cleaned the houses, wrote slogans, and drew cartoons to beautify the kindergartens. In a very short time, they established close relationships with the children. During this period, the teachers and students adopted a method of teaching and learning at the same time, and conducted on-site teaching by class. Because teaching was combined with practice and the content was greatly enriched, the students learned a lot of knowledge that could not be learned in the classroom. Moreover, through early childhood education practice, the students' thinking was greatly enlivened, and their creativity was brought into play. They used their spare time to collect many local folk songs, folk tales, and children's rhymes, and compiled hundreds of children's textbooks. They also created many dances, games, and children's exercises. All of these have significantly improved the quality of teaching. In the past, there had to be a long preparation time before the exam, and this time they went back to school and immediately took the exam. Most of the students scored four or five points. In particular, through practical exercises, many students have learned to work as childcare workers, cooks, and nurses. They can not only lecture, but also cook, sew, and even cut hair and take care of the children, becoming all-rounders in early childhood education. In-depth practice and on-site teaching have also promoted teaching reform. After the teachers and students went into practice, they found that the previous teaching was seriously divorced from reality. For example, children like to dance very much, but the women's teachers do not have this course; in the music class, there are no children's songs at all. Through on-site teaching and contact with reality, teachers have been greatly educated, and teachers of various subjects have reformed the teaching materials according to their experiences in practice. For example, the Chinese teachers used the collected folk tales and legends to add children's literature to the "Literature" class; the music class streamlined the music theory and added children's songs, organ playing, and other teaching; the history teachers, in addition to revising the history class to suit early childhood normal education, also compiled a history of the People's Commune after visiting and investigating.
    In the new semester, the school's teaching plan will more closely integrate teaching with productive labor, classroom teaching with on-site teaching, and achieve both learning, laboring, and running gardens. The arrangement of teaching and production is five days of study per week, and one day is spent combining professional characteristics in the children's teaching aids, toy factory and children's clothing factory labor. In learning, the first grade does preliminary internships in street-run kindergartens, the second grade interns in the school's affiliated kindergartens, and the third grade self-run kindergartens while teaching and learning. In the last month of each semester, they go deep into the countryside to participate in labor and conduct on-site teaching.

### 又学习　又劳动　又办幼儿园  太原女子师范丰富教学内容

    又学习　又劳动　又办幼儿园
    太原女子师范丰富教学内容
    本报讯　山西省太原女子师范学校，组织师生深入农村和街道，一面参加劳动，一面协助公社和街道办幼儿园，进行现场教学，收获很大。
    这个学校的师生三百五十余人，组成二十七个组，于去年12月分别下放到几个农村人民公社和街道。她们除参加劳动外，并在当地党委支持下，协助人民公社和街道办起了一百零九个幼儿园，共收幼儿四千余人，培养训练了九百四十名保教人员，使两千三百多妇女参加了劳动。
    在劳动锻炼和办幼儿园活动中，学生们亲身体会到幼儿教育事业的重要，大大提高了政治觉悟，巩固了专业思想。一年级有一个班过去90％以上的学生不安心学习，现在99％的学生学习情绪都很高涨，她们表示要献身于这个崇高的事业，为祖国培养共产主义接班人。她们积极地投入办园活动，利用破碎布头给孩子们缝布娃娃，利用废物制作教具、玩具，不少学生亲自动手打扫房子，写标语、画漫画，美化幼儿园。很短时间就和孩子们建立了亲密的感情。师生们在这一段过程中采取边教边学的办法，以班为单位进行了现场教学。由于教学结合实际，内容大大丰富，使学生们学到了很多课堂里学不到的知识。并且，学生们通过幼儿教育实践，思想大大活跃，发挥了创造能力，利用业余时间搜集了很多地方民歌、民间故事、儿童歌谣等，编写了数百篇儿童教材，还创作了许多舞蹈、游戏和儿童体操等。这些都使教学质量有了显著的提高。以往考试前，都要有一段较长的准备时间，这次她们回校后即行考试，绝大部分学生的成绩都是四分、五分。特别是通过实际锻炼，许多学生学会做保育员、炊事员、护理员等的工作，既能讲课，又能给孩子们做饭、缝衣以至于理发、看护，成为幼儿教育工作的多面手。深入实际和现场教学也促进了教学改革。师生们深入实际以后，发现以往教学中脱离实际的严重现象。比如孩子们很喜欢跳舞，但女师却没有这门课；音乐课中，根本没有儿童歌曲。通过现场教学和接触实际，使教师受到很大教育，各科教师根据实践中的体验，对教材进行了改革。如语文教师利用搜集来的民间故事、传说，在“文学”课中增加了儿童文学；音乐课精简了乐理，增加了儿童歌曲、风琴弹奏等教学；历史教师除了把历史课改得适合于幼儿师范教育，还经过访问调查，编写了人民公社史。
    在新的学期里，这个学校的教学计划，使教学与生产劳动、课堂教学与现场教学更密切结合起来，做到又学习、又劳动、又办园。教学与生产的安排是每周学习五天，以一天时间，结合专业特点在儿童教具、玩具厂和儿童服装厂劳动。学习中，一年级在街道民办幼儿园做初步实习，二年级在本校附属幼儿园实习，三年级自办幼儿园边教边学。每学期最后一个月深入到农村，参加劳动，并进行现场教学。
