Constantly Summarize Small Blast Furnace Experience
Wei Pu Steel Plant Erects a Red Banner of High Yield, High Quality, and Low Cost

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th dispatch) The fifteen-cubic-meter small blast furnace of the Wei Pu Steel Plant in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, has erected a red banner for a comprehensive leap forward. Due to the mobilization of workers to vigorously innovate technology and improve enterprise management, the utilization coefficient of this newly built small blast furnace has stabilized at 1.5087 since March. The qualified rate of pig iron reached 95.5%, and the coke ratio was reduced to 1.05. Since February, the entire plant's workers have been mobilized to grasp management, transforming from losses to profits. All indicators have exceeded the competition conditions and struggle goals proposed by the National Small Blast Furnace Conference.

This is a semi-native and semi-foreign small blast furnace, with relatively simple power, blowing, and charging equipment. The workers are unfamiliar with blast furnace ironmaking. Some people lacked confidence in these production conditions. Shortly after the furnace was opened in July last year, the Party committee proposed a leap forward plan of fifteen tons per day. At that time, individual grass-roots cadres emphasized insufficient air volume and temperature, believing that it could not be achieved even if the furnace was broken. However, after the indicators and tasks were given to the workers for discussion, effective measures emerged one after another. While strengthening equipment maintenance, they adopted the method of connecting a spare blower with a commonly used one, and using two hot blast stoves in parallel, which doubled the air volume and maintained the air temperature at 650 degrees. In this way, the smelting cycle was greatly shortened, and the daily pig iron production level quickly increased from seven or eight tons to fifteen tons.

In order to stabilize and continue to improve the operation of the small blast furnace, Wei Pu Steel Plant has extracted a set of experiences for comprehensive technical management from constantly summarizing the production experience of workers. The workers realized from production practice that each link in the blast furnace production process must be closely linked. For example, after the air volume and temperature increased, the output fluctuated due to the lack of strict charging system and the continuous occurrence of equipment accidents. The workers of the charging section discussed and formulated "sintering and roasting, strict block size, flat laying and vertical extraction, and graded charging" as the code of conduct to ensure the smooth operation of the blast furnace. The workers of the power section also ensured the normal operation of the machines and prevented the blast furnace from lacking air and water by strictly enforcing the shift handover system and clarifying the responsibility system. Because the technical management links are closely linked, the daily production level has risen from 15 tons to 22 tons.

After the blast furnace production stabilized, the plant mobilized workers to rectify enterprise management work with the spirit of comprehensively managing the enterprise and running the enterprise diligently and thriftily. The plant leaders found in summarizing last year's work that although the pig iron plan was overfulfilled, there were still losses before January this year due to the short production time and the neglect of cost accounting. In order to reverse this situation, the Party committee launched a financial assault month campaign among the workers in February. After the workers exposed various wasteful phenomena, in addition to formulating strict production costs and financial expenditures, they further adjusted the labor organization and studied the principles of rational development and transportation of ore. After the rectification, more than 400 laborers were drawn to enrich and strengthen the mining force. After they implemented the cost accounting by everyone, the cost of each ton of pig iron in February was reduced from the original 271 yuan to 208 yuan, reversing the loss situation.

    经常总结小高炉经验
    苇瀑钢铁厂竖起高产优质成本低的红旗
    本报太原30日电　山西阳泉市苇瀑钢铁厂十五立方公尺的小高炉竖起了全面大跃进的红旗。这个厂由于发动职工大力革新技术和改进企业管理，使这座新建的小高炉从3月份以来利用系数稳定到一点五零八七。生铁合格率达到95.5％，焦比降低到一点零五。2月份以来又发动全厂职工人人抓管理，由亏赔一变而为盈余。各项指标都超过了全国小高炉会议提出的竞赛条件和奋斗目标。
    这是一座半土半洋的小高炉，动力、鼓风、上料设备都比较简陋，职工们对高炉炼铁很陌生。有些人对这种生产条件信心不足。去年7月份开炉不久党委提出日产十五吨的跃进计划，当时个别基层干部强调风量、风温不足，认为撑破炉子也达不到。可是，当指标、任务交给职工讨论后，一个个得力的措施就源源而来。他们在加强设备维护的同时，采取备用的鼓风机和常用的并连、两个暖风洞并用的办法，使风量增大一倍、风温保持到六百五十度。这样，冶炼周期大大缩短，生铁日产水平很快由七、八吨提高到十五吨。
    为了稳定并继续提高小高炉的操作，苇瀑钢铁厂从不断总结职工生产经验中摸出一套全面进行技术管理的经验。职工们从生产实践中认识到高炉生产过程的各个环节之间必须环环扣紧。如风量、风温加大以后由于下料制度不严格，和设备事故不断发生，产量忽上忽下。上料工段职工就讨论出“烧结焙烧、严格块度、平铺立取、分级入炉”作为保证高炉顺行的守则。动力工段工人们也从严格交接班制度、明确责任制等方面来保证机器正常运转，不让高炉缺风、缺水。由于技术管理一环紧扣一环，日产水平由十五吨又节节上升到二十二吨。
    高炉生产稳定以后，这个厂以全面管理企业和勤俭办企业的精神发动职工整顿企业管理工作。厂领导在总结去年工作中发现虽然超额完成了生铁计划，但由于生产时间不长和忽视成本核算，今年1月份以前还有亏损。为了扭转这种局面，厂党委在2月份发动职工开展了财务突击运动月，职工们揭发了种种浪费现象后，除制定出严格生产费用和财务开支外，进一步调剂了劳动组织和研究出合理开发、运输矿石的原则。经过整顿，抽出了四百余名劳动力充实和加强了采矿力量。他们在贯彻了人人抓成本核算以后，2月份每吨生铁成本由原来的二百七十一元降低到二百零八元，扭转了亏损局面。（附图片）
