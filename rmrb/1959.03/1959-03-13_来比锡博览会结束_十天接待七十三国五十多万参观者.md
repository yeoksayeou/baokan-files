Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th - The Leipzig Spring Fair concluded on the 10th. Over the course of ten days, the fair welcomed more than 585,000 visitors from 73 countries, including 37,000 from Western countries. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev also visited the fair. The pavilions of the socialist countries left a good impression on the audience. Many exhibits were considered by Western visitors to surpass the West and be of true world-class level.

This year, many Western European manufacturers sent important representatives to participate in the fair. Britain alone sent representatives from 190 large manufacturers. Representatives of heavy industrial manufacturers from the Rhine and Ruhr areas of West Germany, as well as managers of some large banks, also came to the fair one after another. Faced with increasingly difficult sales in the capitalist world market, they paid close attention to Khrushchev's several speeches in Leipzig on developing East-West trade. Some Western European manufacturers were eager to contact the trade circles of socialist countries to explore the possibility of promoting their products. In the inquiry office of the Chinese pavilion alone, nearly a hundred such guests were received every day. Many Western European manufacturers conducted business with socialist countries at the fair.

Various socialist countries also engaged in trade at this fair. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic concluded contracts for machinery and equipment worth 400 million rubles, and China and the German Democratic Republic signed a trade contract worth more than 100 million rubles and a protocol. The German Democratic Republic also signed a trade and shipping agreement with Vietnam.

    来比锡博览会结束
    十天接待七十三国五十多万参观者
    新华社柏林11日电　来比锡春季博览会于10日结束。十天来，博览会接待了来自七十三个国家的五十八万五千多位参观者，其中的三万七千人是从西方国家来的。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫也曾参观了博览会。社会主义国家的展览馆给观众留下良好的印象。许多展品，被西方参观者认为是超过西方而具有真正世界水平。
    今年，许多西欧厂商都派了重要代表参加博览会。仅英国就派了一百九十家大厂商的代表。西德莱因、鲁尔区重工业厂商代表和一些大银行经理也先后来到博览会。在资本主义世界市场销售日益困难的情况下，他们非常注意赫鲁晓夫在来比锡几次关于发展东西方贸易的演说，一些西欧厂商急于和社会主义国家的贸易界接触，探询推销他们商品的可能性。仅在中国馆的询问处里，每天就要接待近百位这样的客人。许多西欧厂商在博览会上和社会主义国家作了买卖。
    各社会主义国家也在这次博览会上进行了贸易。苏联和德意志民主共和国缔结了价值四亿卢布的机器装备合同，中国和德意志民主共和国签订了一项价值一亿卢布以上的贸易合同和一项议定书。德意志民主共和国还和越南签订了贸易和航运协定。
