Sewage Irrigation Has Many Benefits
	Long Zhentao

Every day, cities discharge a large amount of sewage, such as wastewater from washing vegetables and dishes from kitchens, wastewater with soap suds from washrooms and bathhouses, and fecal sewage from toilets. Beijing alone discharges about 500,000 tons of sewage every day. In the past, sewage was usually discharged into rivers, which not only affected river hygiene but also was a waste. Because sewage contains a lot of fertilizer, using sewage to irrigate farmland and vegetable fields has great economic value.

The growth of any crop requires four basic conditions: light, heat, water, and mineral nutrients. Among these four conditions, light and heat come from the sun and are inexhaustible. Water and mineral nutrients belong to soil factors, which can be controlled and modified by humans.

There are many kinds of mineral nutrients, and the main elements are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen can be obtained from the air. Crops need the most nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and very little of other nutrients. The fertilization we talk about, whether it is chemical fertilizer or manure, is generally to increase the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. The water supply of crops depends on atmospheric precipitation and agricultural water conservancy irrigation measures. Using sewage irrigation can not only supply water but also accumulate fertilizer, because sewage contains a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Every hundred tons of sewage contains about ten catties of nitrogen, three catties of phosphorus, and two catties of potassium. If all the city's sewage is collected, it will be a great fortune.

The advantages of using sewage irrigation can be summarized as follows:

	Rich in fertilizer and high irrigation efficiency. Sewage is especially rich in nitrogen fertilizer, which promotes rapid crop growth, large leaves and stems, and high yield. In addition, because the temperature of sewage is higher than that of clean water, irrigation will not lower the soil temperature and promote earlier crop maturity.

	Low irrigation cost. Generally, after using sewage for irrigation, each mu of farmland can save 25 yuan in fertilizer costs. Irrigation with sewage can save about 20 man-days and 5 animal-days per mu compared to using clean water.

	Makes the soil fertile. Sewage contains many organic substances with high viscosity and adsorption, which can make soil particles form small clods, increase water content, and improve the soil, which can turn wasteland into fertile land.

	Beneficial to urban sanitation.

	Saves the construction of urban sewage pipelines and sewage treatment equipment.

In addition, in order to prevent the harm of germs and roundworm eggs, it is best to carry out sedimentation in the pool before using sewage for irrigation, so that bacteria and insect eggs can settle together with the sludge, which can remove more than 90% of parasitic eggs and worms, while nitrogen fertilizer only reduces by 5%. According to domestic and Soviet data, sewage irrigation can increase production by one or two times or more.

    污水灌溉好处多
    龙振涛
    从城市里每天都排出大量的污水，如：从厨房排出的洗菜、洗碗的污水，从洗脸室及澡塘排出带有肥皂沫的污水，从厕所排出的粪便污水等。单北京市，每天排出的污水就约有五十万吨。过去通常是把污水放入河流，这样不仅影响河流卫生，而且也是一种浪费。因为污水中含有很多肥料，利用污水灌溉农田、菜田，有很大经济价值。
    任何农作物的生长都需要四个基本条件，即：光，热，水和矿物质养分。这四个条件中光和热是从太阳来的，是取之不尽用之不竭的。而水和矿物质养分则属于土壤因素，是可以人为控制和改造的。
    矿物质养分种类很多，主要元素有碳，氢，氧，氮，磷，钾等等。碳，氢，氧可以从空气中获得。农作物需要氮磷钾养分最多，别的养分需要量极少。我们所说的施肥，无论是化肥或粪肥一般都是为增加土壤中氮磷钾的含量。而农作物水分供给则靠大气降雨及采取农田水利灌溉措施。利用污水灌溉既可供应水分又可以积肥，因为在污水中含有大量氮磷钾。每百吨污水中约含十斤氮，三斤磷，二斤钾，如果把全市污水汇集起来，将是一笔很大财富。
    用污水灌溉的好处概括说来有以下几点：
    肥分多，灌溉效率高。污水中尤以氮肥较多，促使农作物生长快，叶茎肥大产量高。此外，由于污水温度比清水高，灌溉后不致使土温降低促进作物提早成熟。
    灌溉成本低。一般农田用污水灌溉后每亩可节省肥料二十五元，灌溉时比用清水灌溉每亩可节省约二十个人力和五个畜力。
    使土壤肥沃。污水中含很多有机物具有很高粘性和吸附性，能使土壤颗粒形成小土块状，提高含水量改良土壤，可使荒地变肥沃。
    有利于城市卫生。
    节省城市污水管道的建设及污水处理设备。
    此外，为防止病菌及蛔虫卵的侵害，在用污水灌溉前最好先在池中进行沉淀，使细菌及虫卵与污泥一起沉淀可除寄生卵虫90％以上，而氮肥只减少5％。根据国内及苏联资料，用污水灌溉可增产一、二倍以上。
