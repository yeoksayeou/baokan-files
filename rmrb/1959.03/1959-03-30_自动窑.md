Automatic Kiln

    In enamel factories, the work of kiln operators is the most arduous. Standing in front of the high-temperature kiln opening, kiln workers use steel forks to load and unload enamel blanks, weighing more than ten pounds each. A worker has to fork these in and out more than a thousand times a day.

    Last year, the Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory created China's first automatic kiln.

    The automatic kiln is a circular brick-built kiln, inside which is a rotating turntable. Workers only need to place the enamel blanks, one by one, from the not-so-high temperature kiln entrance onto the turntable. The turntable then carries the enamel products on a journey through the furnace, where the temperature reaches 900 degrees Celsius. By the time they reach the kiln exit again, the enamel products are already fired.

    Compared to the earthen kiln, this automatic kiln increases production by 2.6 times and saves half of the labor. The automatic kiln was successfully developed by four workers from the Huafeng Factory. (Attached picture)

    自动窑
    在搪瓷厂，烧窑工人的操作是最艰苦的。烧窑工人站在高温窑口前面，用钢叉把十多斤重的搪瓷生坯叉进去烧；烧好，又叉出来。一个工人一天要这样叉进叉出一千多次。
    上海华丰搪瓷厂去年创造了我国第一座自动窑。
    自动窑是一个圆形的砖砌的窑，窑里是一个旋转的转盘。工人只要把搪瓷生坯从温度不高的窑门口依次放在转盘上，转盘就带着搪瓷品到里面温度高达九百度的炉里周游一圈，等到再到出窑口时，搪瓷品已经烧好了。
    这种自动窑比起土窑来，产量提高二点六倍，节约劳动力一半。自动窑是华丰厂的四个工人研究成功的。（附图片）
