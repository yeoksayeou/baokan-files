    Giving Full Play to Mass Enthusiasm and Vigorous Tool Reform
    Jiangxi's Water Conservancy Projects Make Rapid Progress with Good Quality
    (Our Nanchang Dispatch, March 1) After drawing a large number of laborers to invest in fertilizer accumulation, Jiangxi Province's water conservancy projects still achieved simultaneous leaps in project progress and quality. According to statistics, the province has completed more than 286 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, completed 62 medium-sized projects, more than 3,000 key projects with an area of more than 1,000 mu, and more than 60,000 small-scale projects, which can expand the irrigation area by more than 2.16 million mu. After inspection, the project quality is generally very good.
    This year's water conservancy task in Jiangxi Province is more than double that of last year. Initially, 2.1 million people were投入into the water conservancy front. In December, when the province's large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement began, localities transferred 500,000 people from the water conservancy front to support fertilizer accumulation. At this time, many water conservancy construction sites proposed challenge competitions with the fertilizer accumulation army, guaranteeing that with fewer people, they would resolutely complete the water conservancy tasks and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.
    Although the water conservancy army was reduced, a more extensive and in-depth tool reform movement was launched on water conservancy construction sites throughout the province, pushing the high-efficiency movement of water conservancy construction sites to a new stage, and the daily progress of the project increased by about one time compared with the past. According to recent statistics, the province has created and promoted more than 920,000 pieces of advanced improved water conservancy tools. At present, on various construction sites, there are "airships," "aerial trains," lever soil lifting devices, swing-type soil conveying devices, wooden cranes, and "sky bridge" earth trains flying in the air; on the ground there are ox-drawn earth trains, rope-pulled trains, three-wheeled soil carts, tracked soil transporters, earth trucks, automatic pile drivers, automatic soil levelers, and automatic sprinklers; on mountain slopes and inclined roads, wooden rails and earth funnels are everywhere; and in the water, there are rope-pulled bamboo rafts, water turbine-driven tugboats, and various boats and rafts. All of these have increased the efficiency of digging, transporting, and compacting soil by several times or even dozens of times. In Jiujiang Prefecture, Duchang County set up 58 local explosive factories in a few days, producing more than 28,000 jin of local explosives, engaging in large-scale blasting and plowing; and transferred more than 500 head of draft cattle and hundreds of double-wheeled double-furrow plows to eliminate digging soil with shovels, making the soil digging efficiency 15 times higher than before. Yugan County, which suffered severe drought and flood disasters last year, had 35,000 water conservancy soldiers who were even more enthusiastic. They drilled mouths when encountering valleys, built reservoirs when encountering ridges, dug ponds, dredged ditches, and enclosed lakes in low-lying areas, determined to guarantee a bumper harvest this year even if there were extraordinarily large droughts and floods. In this vigorous tool reform movement, they also put forward more than 70,000 rationalization proposals, created and promoted more than 30,000 advanced improved tools, and every migrant worker used advanced improved tools, and the average daily efficiency per person jumped from 4 cubic meters to more than 10 cubic meters.
    While launching a more effective tool reform movement, local party committees have paid special attention to strengthening political and ideological leadership on water conservancy construction sites and improving labor organization, which has also greatly improved labor efficiency. After Yongxiu County transferred a batch of labor to participate in fertilizer accumulation, it carried out a "three fine accounts" (time, task, labor) and "two comparisons" (the advantages and disadvantages of completing or not completing water conservancy projects) discussion on various construction sites, using communist education as the guiding principle, so that the water conservancy army realized the importance and possibility of completing water conservancy projects, which greatly inspired the masses' enthusiasm for labor. On this basis, the party committees of each construction site in the county reorganized the labor organization according to the specific situation, forming more than 2,000 specialized teams for digging soil, transporting soil, and compacting soil on each construction site; implemented a "five-fixed" responsibility system for the project: fixed time, fixed labor, fixed task, fixed quality, and fixed tools; achieving a quota for everything, everyone having something to do, eliminating wasting labor and greatly improving labor efficiency. In this way, a red flag competition upsurge was quickly formed on the construction site between individuals, between companies, and between construction sites, making the water conservancy construction site of the county appear a new atmosphere of "one full and three fast" (full loading of vehicles, fast loading of soil, fast transporting of soil, and fast compacting of soil). In Pengze County, more than 2,000 cadres on the water conservancy construction site, from the county party secretary to the township and commune cadres, went deep into the companies and platoons, eating, living, and working with the migrant workers, which also greatly encouraged the migrant workers' enthusiasm for labor.
    Running factories on a large scale on water conservancy construction sites, so that construction sites are industrialized, is another important measure for the simultaneous leap in project progress and project quality. At the beginning of water conservancy construction in Jiangxi Province, each construction site started to run factories. Up to now, more than 4,200 factories have been set up throughout the province. Among these factories, there are woodworking factories, as well as cement factories and explosives factories manufacturing materials, providing materials for the construction site in a timely manner. Wan'an County set up more than 200 such factories on various water conservancy construction sites, so that the materials needed for the more than 570 water conservancy projects completed in the county this year and the tools needed for the more than 20,000 water conservancy troops were supplied in a timely manner, without asking the higher authorities for any materials, nor buying a single tool from other places.

    发挥群众干劲大抓工具改革
    江西水利工程进度快质量好
    本报南昌1日电　江西省水利工程在抽走大批劳力投入积肥以后，工程进度和质量仍然齐跃双飞。根据统计，全省已完成土石方达二亿八千六百多万公方，建成中型工程六十二座，千亩以上的重点工程三千多座，小型工程六万多座，共可扩大灌溉面积二百一十六万多亩。经检查，工程质量一般都很好。
    江西省今年的水利任务等于去年的两倍多。最初有二百一十万人投入水利战线。12月，当全省大规模的积肥运动开始后，各地从水利战线上抽调了五十万人支援积肥。这时，许多水利工地提出与积肥大军挑战竞赛，保证在人减少的情况下，坚决完成水利任务，保证农业大丰收。
    水利大军虽然减少了，但是全省的水利工地又掀起了一个更广泛更深入的工具改革运动，把水利工地的高工效运动推向了一个新的阶段，工程日进度比过去约增加一倍。根据最近的统计，全省创造和推广的水利先进改良工具达九十二万多件。目前各个工地上，在空中飞的有空中飞船、空中列车、杠杆吊土器、秋千式送土器、木质起重机、天桥式土火车；在平地上跑的有牛拉土火车、绳索牵引列车、三轮拖土车、履带运土机、土汽车、自动打硪机、自动平土机、自动洒水机；在山坡斜道上则满布着木轨道和土漏斗；在水中游的有绳索牵引竹排、水轮机带动的牵引船和各种船筏。所有这些，把挖土、运土和压土的工效提高了几倍以至几十倍。九江专区都昌县在几天中就办起了五十八个土炸药厂，制出了两万八千多斤土炸药，大搞爆炸，大搞耕翻；并抽调了五百多头耕牛和几百部双轮双铧犁，消灭了用锹挖土，使挖土工效比原来提高十五倍。去年遭受严重水旱灾害的余干县，三万五千名水利大军更是干劲冲天，他们是遇谷钻口、逢陇做库、挖塘疏渠、洼地围湖，决心保证今年即使有特大的水旱灾害，也要夺取丰收。在这次大闹工具改革运动中，他们又提出了七万多件合理化建议，创造和推广了三万多件先进改良工具，每个民工都用上了先进改良工具，每天每人平均工效由四公方跃到十公方以上。
    在掀起一个更有效的工具改革运动的同时，各地党委都特别注意加强对水利工地的政治思想领导，改善了劳动组织，这也大大地提高了劳动效率。永修县在抽调一批劳力参加积肥以后，即以共产主义教育为纲，在各个工地上开展了一次算三笔细账（时间、任务、劳力）和作两个比较（完成与完不成水利工程的利弊）的鸣放辩论，使水利大军认识到完成水利工程的重要性和可能性，大大地激励了群众的劳动热情。在此基础上，该县各工地党委又根据具体情况，对劳动组织进行了整顿，在各个工地上组成挖土、运土、压土等专业队二千多个；对工程则实行了定时间、定劳力、定任务、定质量、定工具的五定责任制；做到事事有定额，人人有事做，消灭了窝工浪费现象，大大提高了劳动效率。这样，在工地上很快形成了一个个人与个人、连队与连队、工地与工地的红旗竞赛高潮，使全县水利工地出现了“一满三快”（装车满，上土快、运土快、压土快）的新气象。彭泽县在水利工地的两千多名干部，从县委书记到乡社干部都深入到连、排，与民工同吃同住同劳动，也大大鼓舞了民工的劳动热情。
    在水利工地大办工厂，使工地工厂化，是目前水利工程进度和工程质量齐跃双飞的另一重要措施。江西省水利建设一开始，各工地就着手办工厂，到目前为止，全省已办起了四千二百多个工厂。在这些工厂中，有木工厂，也有制造材料的水泥厂、炸药厂，及时为工地提供材料。万安县在各个水利工地上办起了二百多个这样的工厂，使全县今年建成的五百七十多座水利工程所需要的材料和两万多水利大军所需要的工具都得到了及时供应，没有向上级要一点材料，也没有向外地买一件工具。
