    Hopes for "Cultural Street Corner"

    I very much enjoy reading the short commentaries and suggestions published in the "Cultural Street Corner" column of the supplement. But I have a feeling that there is very little discussion directly related to the cultural life of the countryside.

    I hope this column will also talk about issues in rural cultural life. I welcome Comrade Qin Li to visit the countryside more often, so that he can discover many topics worth discussing.

    对“文化街头”的希望
    副刊的“文化街头”栏里，发表了不少短小的评论与建议，我非常喜欢看。但有一个感觉，就是直接有关农村的文化生活，谈得很少。
    希望在这一栏里也谈谈农村文化生活中的问题。欢迎秦犁同志多到农村走一走，那样就会发现很多值得一谈的题目。
