    To complete the 1959 national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, the entire Party and all the people must, on the basis of the various basic measures already taken by the state, launch a mass movement of technological revolution that is broader in scope and more deeply mobilized than in 1958, with soaring enthusiasm, and strive to rapidly and greatly improve labor productivity.
    Due to the rapid advancement of socialist construction, labor shortages were already felt in 1958. The realization of this year's grand targets for industrial and agricultural production requires more labor. Taking grain production as an example, according to the situation in many places, each laborer who can be used for grain crop production this year must bear an average burden of twenty mu. In 1958, the average daily output was about twenty-eight jin, while this year it needs to reach about fifty jin. If we follow the technical level of 1958, it would require double the labor force. Therefore, this year, one laborer must play the role of one and a half, two, or even more laborers. This requires continuing to vigorously promote a mass movement of technological revolution centered on reforming production tools and methods, to improve labor productivity. Only when the people of the whole country work hard to study and reform production tools and methods in production anytime and anywhere, change the relatively backward production tools to more advanced production tools, change the relatively backward production methods to more advanced production methods, constantly innovate, and constantly move forward, will the same amount of labor produce greater labor results.
    This year's mass movement of technological revolution should first focus on summarizing and promoting the achievements of inventions and technological innovations in the 1958 technological revolution movement of the entire Party and the entire people. Because these achievements are the creations and innovations of our people in production practice, they are easily mastered by the masses and easily produce rapid results. Some of these achievements have been promoted, but many have not yet been summarized and promoted. As long as all localities immediately seize this work, the many advanced achievements and experiences of 1958 will play a significant role in this year's greater leap forward in production.
    This year, there are more favorable conditions for carrying out the technological revolution than in 1958. Encouraged by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses is even higher; the superiority of the people's commune system and the grand economic construction plan for 1959 have opened up a broader path for the development of China's scientific and technological undertakings; after the great leap forward in production and the great development of scientific and technological undertakings in 1958, China's scientific and technological level has been improved to some extent; China's scientific and technological research team has developed relatively rapidly, and a large number of worker-peasant inventors and innovators have joined the scientific and technological research team; in particular, the practice of the great leap forward in production and scientific and technological work has laid a better foundation for the mass movement of the entire Party and the entire people to run science and technology in a big way and vigorously promote technological revolution.
    Whether we can carry out the technological revolution faster and better this year mainly depends on whether we can earnestly implement the "walking on two legs" policy under the leadership of the Party in scientific and technological work, especially the policy of combining the activities of professional scientific and technological research institutions with mass scientific and technological activities. Before the great leap forward in 1958, many people only saw the role of professional scientific and technological research institutions and did not see or underestimated the role of the broad masses in the technological revolution. After the Party called for emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions, this incorrect idea of ​​underestimating the masses was greatly overcome, and the great role of the workers and peasants in scientific and technological activities was recognized by most people. At the same time, some people only saw the role of the masses and ignored the role of professional scientific and technological research institutions. This view was quickly clarified. Over the past year, many professional scientific and technological research institutions have been gradually established across the country. This is the backbone of China's scientific and technological work and is very important; but it must be pointed out that the view of neglecting mass scientific and technological activities is again on the rise to some extent. One of the main manifestations is the neglect of the role of mass scientific and technological organizations in the technological revolution. These one-sided views generated in different periods are not in line with the "walking on two legs" policy and are not conducive to realizing the task of technological revolution proposed by the Party. Obviously, if the status and role of professional scientific and technological research institutions in China's scientific and technological undertakings are belittled, it will greatly weaken the backbone forces of China's scientific and technological undertakings and affect the development of China's scientific and technological undertakings; conversely, if only the role of professional scientific and technological research institutions is paid attention to, and mass scientific and technological activities are ignored or denied, it is also very unfavorable to the development of production and scientific and technological undertakings. Of course, the scientific and technological research work of any professional scientific and technological research department, industrial and mining enterprise, and university must be carried out in accordance with the mass line working method, and scientific and technological personnel of this unit should also be actively mobilized to participate in the mass movement of technological revolution. However, these professional scientific and technological research departments should not and cannot "specially" engage in the mass movement of technological revolution, otherwise it will be impossible to complete the tasks assigned by the state that they bear. Moreover, relying solely on these professional scientific and technological research institutions will never be able to solve the various scientific and technological problems encountered by the broad masses in industrial and agricultural production and other production activities, as well as in people's lives, anytime and anywhere. Only by mobilizing the broad masses, relying on the broad masses, everyone using their brains, thinking of ways, vigorously promoting the mass movement of technological revolution, and combining this mass movement with professional scientific and technological research institutions, can we quickly and effectively solve the thousands, large and small, various, and ever-present scientific and technological problems in industrial and agricultural production and other production activities, as well as in the lives of the broad masses of people. The experience of 1958 has proved that the scientific and technological activities of the broad masses have extremely vigorous vitality. As long as the broad masses are mobilized to vigorously promote the technological revolution, certain problems that professional scientific and technological research institutions have not solved for a long time will be solved quickly. Therefore, the activities of professional scientific and technological research institutions and mass scientific and technological activities are complementary. We must correctly understand the roles of the two and their mutual relationship, and we must vigorously strengthen the work of professional scientific and technological research institutions, and we must also vigorously carry out mass scientific and technological activities. The two should be closely combined, mutually promoted, and mutually supported, so that China's technological revolution movement will advance on a larger scale and at a faster speed.
    Since the great leap forward in 1958, the situation of "walking on two legs" in scientific and technological work has actually gradually formed. The problem is that we must consciously recognize this situation and be good at guiding the situation so that mass scientific and technological activities can more effectively play its role. We can see that: first, Party committees at all levels, especially grassroots Party committees, need an organization that specializes in mass scientific and technological activities as an assistant for them to regularly lead mass scientific and technological activities, so that the mass movement of technological revolution can be carried out continuously and deeply. Moreover, if this organization has a relatively broad and fixed mass base, the assistant role will be greater; second, the mass movement of technological revolution is to be launched everywhere and everyone participates. However, every factory or people's commune will inevitably have a group of activists in the movement. This group of activists is the backbone of the mass movement of technological revolution in each unit. In order to facilitate activities and collaboration, this group of backbones urgently requires being organized according to the needs of scientific and technological research activities. Since the great leap forward in 1958, many industrial and mining enterprises and rural people's communes have had various organizations of this kind. In addition to the organizations of the Science and Technology Association, there are many other forms, such as "Scientific Research Group," "Technological Revolution Group," "Tool Reform Group," "Zhuge Liang Meeting," and so on. Although these names are different, in essence, they are roughly the organizations of the backbone of the mass movement of technological revolution. Under the leadership of the Party, these organizations have also played a certain role. Because these organizational forms lack extensive connections up and down, inside and outside, the role is not big enough, and these shortcomings should be corrected. Third, once mass scientific and technological research activities are launched, the broad masses urgently require mastering scientific and technological knowledge, requiring the combination of practice and theory, the combination of popularization and improvement, and therefore requiring the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants. This year, we must be good at summarizing the experience of the mass movement of technological revolution vigorously promoted in various places since 1958, so that the role of mass scientific and technological research activities in industrial and agricultural production will be greatly improved compared with 1958, to meet the needs of national economic construction.
    In order to summarize the experience of mass scientific and technological activities, and to launch a mass movement of technological revolution more broadly and deeply, the China Association for Science and Technology held a national work conference of the Association for Science and Technology in Hangzhou from late January to mid-February. The conference analyzed the current situation and tasks of production and construction and the mass movement of technological revolution, further clarified the policy of "walking on two legs" in scientific and technological work, and planned the work of the National Association for Science and Technology in 1959 in accordance with the spirit of the national overall plan. This is very necessary and timely. The organizations of the Association for Science and Technology at all levels and the broad masses of members must, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, muster sufficient revolutionary energy, closely combine with production, fully cooperate with relevant departments, and do everything possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of scientific and technological workers and the broad masses of people across the country, rapidly expand the mass scientific and technological team, and continuously push the mass movement of technological revolution to new heights, and strive to continuously improve labor productivity to new levels.

### 更广泛地展开群众性的科学技术活动

    更广泛地展开群众性的科学技术活动
    为了完成1959年以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划，全党全民必须在国家已经采取的各种基本措施的基础上，以冲天的干劲，开展一个比1958年规模更广阔、动员更深入的技术革命的群众运动，为迅速地大大地提高劳动生产率而斗争。
    由于社会主义建设的飞跃前进，在1958年就已经感到劳动力的紧张。今年工农业生产的宏伟指标的实现，要求有更多的劳动力。以粮食生产为例，根据许多地方的情况，今年可以用在粮食作物生产上的劳动力，每个平均须负担二十亩。1958年每个劳动日平均生产约二十八斤，今年则要达到约五十斤。如果按1958年的技术水平，则要求有加倍的劳动力。因此，今年一个劳动力就要起一个半、两个、甚至更多劳动力的作用。这就必须继续大搞以改革生产工具和生产方法为中心的技术革命的群众运动，以提高劳动生产率。只有全国人民在生产中随时随地都努力研究改革生产工具和生产方法，把比较落后的生产工具，改为比较先进的生产工具，比较落后的生产方法改为比较先进的生产方法，不断革新，不断前进，才会使同样多的劳动力产生出更大的劳动成果。
    今年技术革命的群众运动应当首先把重点放在总结和推广1958年全党全民技术革命运动中的发明创造和技术革新的成就上。因为这些成就是我国人民群众在生产实践中的创造和革新，容易为群众掌握，容易迅速发生效果。这些成就，有些已被推广了，但还有不少没有被总结和推广。只要各地立即抓紧这项工作，1958年的许许多多先进成就和经验，就会在今年的生产更大跃进中产生重大的作用。
    今年大搞技术革命比1958年有更为有利的条件。在党的八届六中全会决议的鼓舞下，广大干部和群众的积极性更为高涨；人民公社制度的优越性和1959年宏伟的经济建设计划，给我国科学技术事业的发展开辟了更为广阔的道路；经过1958年的生产大跃进和科学技术事业的大发展，我国科学技术水平已经有所提高；我国科学技术研究队伍有了比较迅速的发展，大量的工农创造发明家和革新家参加了科学技术研究的队伍；特别是生产和科学技术工作大跃进的实践，为全党全民大办科学、大搞技术革命的群众运动打下了更好的基础。
    今年我们能不能把技术革命进行得更快更好，主要看我们在科学技术工作中能不能在党的领导下认真贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，特别是专业的科学技术研究机构的活动和群众性科学技术活动相结合的方针。在1958年大跃进以前，许多人只看到专业科学技术研究机构的作用，看不到或小看了广大群众在技术革命中的作用。在党号召解放思想、破除迷信以后，这种轻视群众的不正确的思想有了很大的克服，工农群众在科学技术活动中的伟大作用，被大多数人公认了。与此同时也有一些人因而又只看到群众的作用，忽视了专业科学技术研究机构的作用。这种看法很快也澄清了。一年来，全国各地已经逐步建立了许多专业的科学技术研究机构，这是我国科学技术工作的骨干，是非常重要的；但必须指出，现在忽视群众性科学技术活动的看法，又有某种程度的抬头。主要表现之一，就是忽视科学技术群众组织在技术革命中的作用。这些在不同时期所产生的片面的看法，是不符合“两条腿走路”的方针，是不利于实现党所提出的技术革命的任务的。很显然，如果贬低了专业科学技术研究机构在我国科学技术事业中的地位和作用，必将大大削弱我国科学技术事业的基干力量，影响我国科学技术事业的发展；反过来，如果只注意专业科学技术研究机构的作用，而忽视或否定群众性科学技术活动，同样是十分不利于生产和科学技术事业的发展的。当然，任何专业科学技术研究部门、工矿企业和高等学校等的科学技术研究工作，都必须按群众路线的工作方法进行，并且也应该积极发动本单位的科学技术人员参加技术革命的群众运动。但是，这些专业科学技术研究部门不应该也不可能“专门”从事技术革命的群众运动，否则就不可能完成它们自己所负担的国家规定的任务。而且，只依靠这些专业科学技术研究机构，也决不可能随时随地解决广大群众在工农业生产和其他生产活动中以及人民生活中遇到的各种各样的科学技术问题。只有发动广大群众，依靠广大群众，大家开动脑筋，想办法，大搞技术革命的群众运动，并且使这个群众运动同专业的科学技术研究机构结合起来，才能迅速而有效地大量地解决工农业生产和其他生产活动中以及广大人民生活中千千万万、大大小小、各种各样、随时随地出现的科学技术问题。1958年的经验已经证明，广大群众的科学技术活动，有极其旺盛的生命力，只要发动广大群众大闹技术革命，专业科学技术研究机构长期没有解决的某些问题，很快就解决了。因此，专业科学技术研究机构的活动和群众性科学技术活动是相辅相成的。我们必须正确地认识二者的作用和它们的相互关系，既要大力加强专业的科学技术研究机构的工作，又要大力开展群众性的科学技术活动。二者应该相互密切结合，相互推动，相互支援，才会使我国的技术革命运动以更大的规模和更快的速度前进。
    1958年大跃进以来，科学技术工作中“两条腿走路”的形势，实际上已经逐渐形成，问题在于我们要自觉地认识到这个形势，并善于因势利导，使群众性的科学技术活动更有效地发挥它的作用。我们可以看到：首先，各级党委特别是基层党委需要一个专门从事群众性科学技术活动的组织，作为自己经常领导群众性科学技术活动的助手，使技术革命的群众运动能够持续深入地开展。而且这种组织如果有比较广泛而固定的群众基础，助手作用就会更大；第二，技术革命的群众运动是要处处发动、人人参加的。但每一个工厂或人民公社都必然在运动中出现一批积极分子，这批积极分子是各单位技术革命群众运动的骨干，这批骨干为了便于活动，便于协作，迫切要求按科学技术研究活动的需要组织起来。1958年大跃进以来，不少工矿企业、农村人民公社已经有各种各样的这一类的组织，除了科学技术协会的组织而外，还有许多形式，如“科学研究小组”、“技术革命小组”、“工具改革小组”、“诸葛亮会”等等。这些名称虽然不同，实质上大体都是技术革命群众运动的骨干的组织。这些组织在党的领导下也都起了一定的作用，这些组织形式由于缺乏上下内外的广泛联系，作用还不够大，应当注意改正这些缺点。第三，群众性的科学技术研究活动，一经开展起来以后，广大群众迫切要求掌握科学技术知识，要求实际和理论相结合，普及和提高相结合，因此也就要求知识分子和工农群众相结合。我们在今年必须善于总结1958年以来各地大搞技术革命的群众运动的经验，要使群众性的科学技术研究活动在工农业生产中的作用，比1958年大大提高，以满足国民经济建设的要求。
    为了总结群众性科学技术活动的经验，更广泛更深入地开展技术革命的群众运动，中国科学技术协会在1月下旬到2月中旬在杭州举行了全国科协的工作会议，会议分析了当前生产建设和技术革命群众运动的形势和任务，进一步明确了科学技术工作中“两条腿走路”的方针，并且根据全国一盘棋的精神，规划了全国科协1959年的工作。这是十分必要和适时的。科协各级组织和广大会员必须在各级党委的统一领导下，鼓足革命干劲，密切结合生产，同有关部门充分协作，千方百计地调动全国科学技术工作者和广大人民群众的积极性，迅速扩大群众性的科学技术队伍，把技术革命的群众运动不断地推向新的高潮，为把劳动生产率不断提高到新的水平而斗争。
