    Organize and Promote Commodity Circulation
    State Council Approves and Transmits Ministry of Commerce Report Requiring Convening of Materials Exchange Meetings at Each Level

    The State Council approved and forwarded the "Report of the Ministry of Commerce on Convening Materials Exchange Meetings at Each Level to Further Improve Urban and Rural Materials Exchange" on March 18, requiring all regions to implement it.

    The State Council stated in its approval: In order to enable the circulation of third-category commodities that the state cannot directly include in the plan to be carried out in a more organized and planned manner, to meet the various needs of production and construction and people's lives as rationally as possible, and to enable the diversified economy of the people's communes to develop in a more planned way, convening materials exchange meetings at each level is a relatively good format.

    The "Report of the Ministry of Commerce to the State Council on Convening Materials Exchange Meetings at Each Level to Further Improve Urban and Rural Materials Exchange" stated that materials exchange meetings have been an effective method for organizing commodity circulation in the past. The materials exchange meetings now required to be convened will draw on past experience and, through the meeting format involving production, circulation, and consumption, sign bilateral or multilateral production-sales combination contracts (agreements) to connect the plans of relevant parties. In this way, the people's communes can plan production, arrange labor, and develop diversified economies based on the contracts, while also planning for the materials needed for production and life. Industrial and handicraft departments can obtain more reliable guarantees for raw material supply, thereby arranging for year-round production and sales, and also having a more stable market. Commercial departments can plan the purchase, allocation, and rational distribution of third-category materials, arrange the market, and ensure that various needs can be met.

    The first category of materials centrally managed by the state must not participate in the exchange to avoid disrupting the state plan. The second category of materials, which the state implements differential allocation, can also participate in the exchange if there is surplus or savings after ensuring the completion of foreign trade and export tasks. When conducting materials exchange, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game, ensure key points, and take care of the original collaborative relationships.

    The report proposes that materials exchange meetings can be convened at each level by the central government, collaborative regions, provinces (autonomous regions), special districts, and counties, in order to combine top-down with bottom-up. The exchange meetings at the level of county and above mainly negotiate various commodity purchase and sales targets and sign general contracts between regions; while the exchange meetings at the county level specifically implement these targets. Therefore, the county's materials exchange meeting should be attended by leading cadres from various communes and production teams to specifically implement the contract tasks signed by the provincial (autonomous regional) and special district meetings; at the same time, it helps the various communes to do a good job in production planning and labor arrangement (including transportation arrangements), so that not only the contracts signed by the provincial (autonomous regional) and special district exchange meetings have reliable guarantees, but also the sideline production of the people's communes is incorporated into the state plan.

    The report states that it is best to convene materials exchange meetings at all levels twice a year. One in the spring, mainly to stipulate supply and sales figures through contracts to arrange production; one in the autumn, mainly to check the implementation of the contract in the first half of the year and supplement and revise the contract to further ensure the full realization of the contract. In order to strive to arrange the market well in the first half of the year, the report believes that it is best for provinces, cities (regions), special districts, and counties to convene a materials exchange meeting in March and April to arrange production and organize supply.

    The report proposes that convening materials exchange meetings at each level is an important aspect of supporting national construction, further strengthening regional and departmental collaboration, and implementing the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game. Therefore, this work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the party committees at all levels, and the people's committees are requested to preside over it. In addition to the commercial departments, representatives from industry, agriculture, handicrafts, people's communes, and regions with collaborative relations should also participate in the exchange meeting. In order to ensure the realization of the contract, transportation departments and supervision departments can also be invited to send representatives to participate. The specific organizational work can be undertaken by the commercial departments.

    有组织地促进商品流转
    国务院批转商业部报告要求逐级召开物资交流会
    新华社23日讯　国务院在3月18日批准并转发了商业部“关于逐级召开物资交流会进一步做好城乡物资交流的报告”，要求各地贯彻执行。
    国务院在批示中说：为了使国家还不可能直接纳入计划的第三类商品的流通也能更有组织有计划地进行，使生产建设和人民生活中各种各样的需要，尽可能得到合理的供应，使人民公社的多种经济能够更有计划地发展，逐级召开物资交流会是一种较好的形式。
    商业部给国务院的“关于逐级召开物资交流会进一步做好城乡物资交流的报告”中说，物资交流会过去就是我们在组织商品流通方面行之有效的办法。现在要求召开的物资交流会，是吸取以往的经验，通过生产、流通和消费三个方面参加的会议形式，签订双边的或多边的产销结合合同（协议），把有关方面的计划衔接起来。这样，人民公社就可以根据合同规划生产，安排劳动力，发展多种经济，同时对生产和生活所需的物资，也可以有计划地安排；工业和手工业部门在原料供应上可以取得更为可靠的保证，据以安排常年生产和销售，也可以更有稳定的市场；商业部门可以有计划地组织三类物资的收购、调拨和合理分配，安排市场，使各种各样的需要，能够得到供应。
    国家集中管理的第一类物资，不得参加交流，以免打乱国家计划；国家实行差额调拨的第二类物资，在确保外调和出口任务完成的前提下，如尚有超产或节约下来的部分，也可以参加交流。在进行物资交流时，必须贯彻全国一盘棋的精神，保证重点和照顾原有的协作关系。
    报告提出，物资交流会，可由中央、协作区、省（区）、专区、县逐级召开，以便上下结合。县以上的各级交流会，主要是协商各种商品购销指标，签订地区间的总合同；而县级的交流会，则是具体的把这些指标落实。因此，县的物资交流会，应有各公社、生产队领导干部参加，把省（区）、专区会议签订的合同任务，具体落实；同时帮助各个公社作好生产规划和劳力安排（包括运输力的安排），这样不仅省（区）、专区级交流会议所订的合同有了可靠的保证，同时也把人民公社的副业生产纳入国家计划的轨道。
    报告中说，各级物资交流会，每年最好分别召开两次。春季一次，主要是通过合同规定供销数字，以安排生产；秋季一次，主要是检查上半年合同执行情况和补充修订合同，进一步保证合同的全部实现。目前为了争取在上半年把市场安排好，报告认为各省、市（区）和专区、县最好在3、4两月间都分别召开一次物资交流会以安排生产，组织供应。
    报告提出，逐级召开物资交流会，是支持国家建设，进一步加强地区和部门协作，贯彻全国一盘棋的方针的一个重要方面。因此，这项工作必须在各级党委的统一领导下，请人民委员会主持进行。参加交流会的，除商业部门外，还应当有工业、农业、手工业、人民公社和有协作关系的地区代表参加。为了保证合同的实现，还可邀请交通部门和监察部门派代表参加。具体组织工作，可由商业部门担负。
