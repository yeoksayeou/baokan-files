Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 20th: The Hungarian National Assembly held a meeting at 3:00 PM local time today to solemnly commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and state leaders Kádár, Münnich, Dobi, and others attended the meeting.

Party and government delegations from fraternal countries including the Soviet Union, China, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Poland, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and Vietnam were invited to participate in the meeting.

The Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly, Rónai, delivered the opening speech. When he expressed a warm welcome on behalf of the participants to the delegations from the fraternal countries, the audience responded with prolonged applause.

Rónai said that forty years ago, the Hungarian people, following the example of the Russian October Socialist Revolution, overthrew the rule of landlords and capitalists, won national independence, and declared the establishment of the Soviet Republic. Imperialist countries, fearing the socialist revolution of the Hungarian people, launched an attack on the Soviet Republic. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hungarian proletariat, together with the broad masses of working peasants and progressive intellectuals, carried out a heroic struggle to defend the people's regime.

Rónai then pointed out that although the imperialists and the Hungarian domestic reactionaries united to temporarily defeat the Republic, the Hungarian people have always persisted in their heroic struggle. He said that in 1945, the Soviet Red Army liberated the Hungarian people, opening up the road for our country's independence, freedom, and socialist construction. The goals of the Hungarian people's struggle forty years ago are now being realized. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people are actively and enthusiastically building socialism. The Hungarian working people are fighting together with the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, for a better future.

After Rónai's speech, Münnich, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, he elaborated on the historical significance and lessons of the founding of the Soviet Republic.

As of 4:00 PM, the meeting was continuing.

    匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年
    布达佩斯隆重集会纪念
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　匈牙利国民议会今天下午三时（当地时间）举行会议，隆重纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党和国家领导人卡达尔、明尼赫、道比等出席了会议。
    应邀参加会议的有苏联、中国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜、波兰、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、越南等兄弟国家的党和政府代表团。
    匈牙利国民议会议长罗奈伊致开幕词。当他代表大会的参加者向各兄弟国家的代表团表示热烈的欢迎时，全场响起了经久不息的掌声。
    罗奈伊说，四十年前，匈牙利人民追随着俄国十月社会主义革命的榜样，推翻了地主—资本家的统治，获得了国家的独立，宣布成立苏维埃共和国。帝国主义国家由于害怕匈牙利人民的社会主义革命，向苏维埃共和国发动了进攻。匈牙利无产阶级在共产党的领导下，同广大的劳动农民、进步的知识分子一起，进行了保卫人民政权的英勇斗争。
    罗奈伊接着指出，虽然帝国主义者和匈牙利国内反动派联合起来，暂时地打败了共和国，但是，匈牙利人民一直坚持英勇的斗争。他说，1945年，苏联红军解放了匈牙利人民，为我国打开了独立、自由和建设社会主义的道路。匈牙利人民四十年前的斗争目标现在正在实现中。匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党的领导下，正在积极和热情地建设社会主义。匈牙利劳动人民正在同苏联和其他社会主义国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一道，共同为美好的未来而斗争。
    罗奈伊致词毕，社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫在会上作了报告。他在报告中阐述了苏维埃共和国成立的历史意义和经验教训。
    截至下午四时，会议在继续进行中。
