Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, March 14th: In the Second Literary and Artistic Review Conference held by the Fujian Front Line Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from February 20th to March 12th, the coastal defense soldiers enthusiastically praised the combat life and heroic spirit of the three services on the front lines with boundless heroic feelings. The chorus "Boom! Our Artillery Speaks" and "The Gunners are Doing Well" performed by the front line artillery enthusiastically sang of their victory in carrying out punitive artillery strikes against the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen. The opera "Communist Fighter Wang Bangde" allowed the audience to see the heroic image of Wang Bangde, the political instructor of an engineering company who sacrificed himself to save others. This opera, and the opera "Red Flag on the Coast," which depicts medical personnel rescuing the heroic gunner Hu De'an, moved the audience to tears. The drama "'One Zero One' Target," written and performed by reconnaissance personnel of an artillery unit based on their own experiences, brought the heroic actions and thrilling scenes of our army's reconnaissance personnel scouting the enemy's situation to the stage. Other excellent programs, such as the crosstalk "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds Surround the Barracks," which reflects the achievements of the front line troops in participating in socialist construction, and the dance "General - Private," which depicts the close relationship between officers and soldiers of the People's Army, were also warmly welcomed by the audience.
