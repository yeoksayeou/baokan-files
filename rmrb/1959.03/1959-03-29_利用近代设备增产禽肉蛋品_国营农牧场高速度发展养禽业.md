Utilizing Modern Equipment to Increase Poultry Meat and Egg Production
State-Run Farms and Ranches Rapidly Develop Poultry Farming

(Our report) State-run farms and ranches across the country are actively adopting various measures to rapidly develop the poultry industry. It is estimated that the total number of poultry this year will increase from the current 2.2 million to more than 10 million. In addition, approximately 10,000 tons of commercial frozen poultry meat will be produced.

In the past, state-run farms and ranches in various regions developed the poultry industry on a smaller scale, with scattered breeding and no clear focus. This year, in order to increase the output of agricultural and livestock products such as chickens, ducks, and eggs more quickly, better, and in greater quantities, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation has decided to focus on developing poultry production bases in the Mishan and Hulin reclamation areas in Heilongjiang, the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island in Guangdong, and other areas. State-run farms and ranches in various provinces will also establish key poultry farms. Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces alone plan to build seventeen chicken and duck farms. Generally, all regions plan to increase poultry production tenfold to twentyfold this year.

Fully utilizing modern technology and equipment, and carrying out mechanical and electrical incubation, are favorable conditions for state-run farms and ranches to develop poultry production. To meet the needs of farms across the country to vigorously develop poultry, dozens of electrical incubators are being shipped from the Beijing Poultry Farm to various regions. At present, land reclamation departments and farms in various regions are actively training technical personnel. Land reclamation departments in Shandong, Jiangxi and other provinces have already started poultry farming training classes. Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei and other provinces have also sent people to Beijing to learn electrical incubation.

In order to ensure a reliable supply of feed required for chickens and ducks, farms in various regions have arranged for feed production bases according to development plans. Jiangxi Province has transported seeds of feed crops such as jack beans, banana roots, and water hyacinth from other regions, and farms across the province have allocated a total of 500,000 mu of land to produce feed. State-run farms and ranches in southern provinces and regions are also making full use of animal feeds such as earthworms, termites, snails, and shrimps to feed poultry. (Fu Wei)

    利用近代设备增产禽肉蛋品
    国营农牧场高速度发展养禽业
    本报讯　全国各地国营农牧场正积极采取种种措施，高速度的发展家禽业，预计今年的家禽总数将由现在的二百二十多万只发展为一千多万只。另外生产商品冻禽肉一万吨左右。
    过去各地国营农牧场发展家禽业的规模较小、饲养分散、没有重点。今年农垦部为了更多更快更好的增加鸡、鸭、禽蛋等农畜产品的产量，决定以黑龙江的密山、合江两垦区、广东的雷州半岛和海南岛等地为发展家禽生产的主要基地。各省国营农牧场也将建立重点家禽场，仅安徽、江苏、山东准备筹建的鸡鸭场就有十七个。一般地区今年也都计划发展家禽十倍到二十倍。
    充分利用现代化的技术设备，开展机械和电气孵化，是国营农牧场发展家禽生产的有利条件。为了满足各地农场大力发展家禽的需要，几十台电气孵化器正从北京家禽场运向各地。现在，各地农垦部门和农场正积极进行培养训练技术人员的工作。山东、江西等省农垦部门已开办了家禽饲养训练班。江苏、安徽、河北等省也已派人到北京学习电气孵化。
    为了使鸡鸭所需的饲料有可靠的保证，各地农场都按照发展计划安排了生产饲料的基地。江西省从外地运进了狗爪豆、蕉藕、水浮莲等饲料作物种子，全省各农场共划出五十万亩土地生产饲料。在南方各省、区的国营农牧场，并做到充分利用蚯蚓、白蚁、螺蛳、虾等动物性饲料来喂养家禽。　（拂为）
