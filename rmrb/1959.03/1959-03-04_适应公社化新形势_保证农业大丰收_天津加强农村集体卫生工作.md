Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 3rd: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a rural health work conference, determining that in 1959, it is necessary to adapt to the new situation of rural communization and further strengthen collective health and healthcare work. Since the counties and suburbs of Tianjin achieved communization last year, rural health and healthcare services have greatly developed. Currently, the city's twelve counties have a total of 264 hospitals and more than 2,000 other health institutions, achieving a situation where every commune has a hospital and every team has a health station. Calculated per capita, the number of beds in 1958 increased by 6.2 times compared to 1957. People's communes in various places have strengthened the leadership of collective living hygiene and construction site hygiene, improved the hygiene of canteens, food hygiene, construction site hygiene, and the hygiene of nurseries and kindergartens. There have also been great improvements in personal hygiene. Various places are also carrying out basic health construction, eradicating and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, while also carrying out activities such as building toilets, livestock sheds, pig pens, sheepfolds, poultry houses, improving drinking water wells, dredging ditches, and filling in pits and depressions.

The conference believed that in order to ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, especially to ensure the realization of grain and cotton targets, the current rural health work will continue to rectify healthcare organizations in conjunction with the overall rectification of communes, improve the quality of medical care, and focus on developing a portion of health services.

The conference decided to unify the masses' medical and preventive work organizationally, forming health centers that are responsible for both treatment and prevention, as well as administrative responsibilities. These will be under the unified leadership of the commune Party committees, with the health centers establishing departments for medical treatment and prevention, pest control and disease elimination, and maternal and child health. On the basis of rectification, medical and preventive work systems will be further established and improved.

Regarding the issue of expanding and improving existing mass health organizations, the conference decided to greatly promote mass health training and popularize health knowledge. Cooks, childcare workers, health workers, etc., will receive short-term specialized training in conjunction with their respective professions; the general public will receive health knowledge education in conjunction with the commune's pest control and disease elimination efforts.

The conference decided that in 1959, the focus should be on developing county hospitals, developing simple hospital beds in communes with suitable conditions, and actively developing the work of epidemic prevention stations. In order to achieve the above tasks, it is necessary to continue to implement the principle of "running undertakings diligently and thriftily" and promote the practice of "combining Chinese and Western medicine" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods."

    适应公社化新形势　保证农业大丰收
    天津加强农村集体卫生工作
    新华社天津3日电　中共天津市委最近召开农村卫生工作会议，确定1959年要适应农村公社化新形势，进一步加强集体卫生保健工作。天津市所属县和郊区在去年实现公社化以后，农村卫生保健事业有很大发展，目前全市十二个县共有医院二百六十四所，其他卫生机构两千多个，已经达到社社有医院，队队有保健站。按人口计算，病床1958年比1957年增加了六点二倍。各地人民公社都加强了集体生活卫生和工地卫生的领导，改善了食堂卫生、饮食卫生、工地卫生和托儿所幼儿园的卫生状况，在个人卫生方面也有了很大改进。各地还在进行卫生基本建设、铲除与消灭蚊蝇孳生场所的同时，开展了修建厕所、畜棚、猪圈、羊栏、禽舍，改良饮水用井，疏通沟渠，填平坑洼等活动。
    会议认为，为了保证今年农业生产大丰收，特别是保证粮棉指标的实现，目前农村卫生工作将结合整社继续整顿保健组织，提高医疗质量，并重点发展一部分卫生事业。
    会议确定把群众的医疗预防工作从组织机构上统一起来，组成既管治疗又管预防并兼行政责任的卫生院，由公社党委统一领导，卫生院设医疗预防、除害灭病、妇幼卫生等股。在整顿的基础上，将进一步建立与健全医疗预防工作制度。
    对扩大与健全现有的群众卫生组织问题，会议确定大搞群众卫生训练，普及卫生知识。对炊事员、保育员、保健员等，分别结合不同专业进行短期的专门训练；对广大群众，结合公社除害灭病进行卫生常识教育。
    会议决定：1959年要重点发展县医院，在有条件的公社发展简易病床，积极发展防疫站的工作。为实现上述任务，要继续贯彻“勤俭办事业”的方针，提倡“中西医结合”、“土洋结合”的作法。
