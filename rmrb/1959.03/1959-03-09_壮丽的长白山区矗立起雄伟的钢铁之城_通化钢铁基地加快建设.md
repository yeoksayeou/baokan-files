A magnificent steel city stands tall in the majestic Changbai Mountains.
Tonghua Iron and Steel Base accelerates construction.

This newspaper reports that Jilin Province, on the basis of the mass iron and steel campaign, is adopting the principle of "walking on two legs" and is building a new type of Tonghua Iron and Steel Base with the Tonghua Iron and Steel United Enterprise as its center. After the completion of this base, it will undertake the vast majority of Jilin Province's steel production tasks this year, contributing to the glorious task of producing 18 million tons of steel nationwide this year.

The Tonghua area is located in the southeastern part of Jilin Province, in the Changbai Mountains. The area has extremely rich mineral resources, with coal and iron reserves of hundreds of millions of tons. More than a dozen rivers, including the Songhua River, the Yalu River, and the Hun River, flow through the area, providing ample water and tremendous power potential. The area has a dense railway network and convenient transportation. All of this provides extremely favorable conditions for establishing an iron and steel base and developing the iron and steel industry. In the mass iron and steel campaign that began last year, the area not only built more than 5,000 small indigenous furnaces and indigenous-foreign integrated iron smelting furnaces, but also built over a hundred small blast furnaces. In the fourth quarter of 1958, the Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the instructions of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, universally rectified, consolidated, and improved the "small indigenous groups," reorganized the scattered "small indigenous groups" into dozens of iron smelting plants of varying sizes, and decided to build four new small iron and steel joint enterprises on the basis of the four existing blast furnace clusters in Tonghua, Qidaogou, Hunjiang, and Dalizi, forming a Tonghua Iron and Steel Base of considerable scale together with the Tonghua Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, which was built first. In this base, five iron and steel joint enterprises of varying sizes are the backbone, with iron smelting plants equipped with blast furnaces ranging from 13 to 255 cubic meters, steelmaking plants equipped with converters and open-hearth furnaces ranging from 12 to 60 tons, small and medium-sized rolling mills, and medium and large coking plants. Among them, after the completion of the Tonghua Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, its annual production capacity will reach 800,000 tons of pig iron, 1 million tons of steel, 800,000 tons of steel, 50,000 tons of seamless steel pipes, and 1.8 million tons of coke. In addition, dozens of renovated indigenous blast furnaces are also an important part of this iron and steel base, and they will provide a large amount of raw materials for steelmaking and rolling as satellite plants of various iron and steel joint enterprises.

The principle of simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously adopting foreign methods and indigenous methods, has greatly accelerated the construction speed of this iron and steel base. Dozens of iron smelting plants here were built using indigenous methods in a simple and crude manner. During the construction process, when there was a shortage of red bricks, the masses made their own adobe bricks; when there was a shortage of refractory bricks, they searched for substitute materials and used indigenous methods to manufacture them; when there was a shortage of blast equipment, the masses made wooden blowers themselves, and in a very short period of time, thousands of various types of blowers were manufactured throughout the area, breaking through the difficulties of insufficient materials and equipment. The 13 to 255 cubic meter blast furnaces that have been started and are under construction are progressing simultaneously according to the principle of simultaneous design, construction, and production. At present, 23 newly built 13 to 28 cubic meter blast furnaces have been put into production one after another. As the center of the Tonghua Iron and Steel Base, the first phase of the iron smelting plant of the Tonghua Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise is nearing completion. Two 255 cubic meter blast furnaces, five hot blast stoves, two scrubbing towers, and dozens of meters high chimneys have soared into the sky. The steelmaking plant, the small rolling mill, and the coking plant have also started construction in full swing. Small iron and steel joint enterprises such as Hunjiang, Qidaogou, and Dalizi are also advancing in step with medium-sized enterprises. Four iron mines and five coal mines serving steel production are also accelerating their exploitation under the principle of simultaneous adoption of indigenous and foreign methods. The base transportation network connecting various mines and factories has been formed. The newly built three major railways, two light railways, three standard highways, and three simple highways have all been opened to traffic.

In the further implementation of the principle of taking steel as the key link in 1959, nearly 150,000 iron and steel troops in the province have rapidly concentrated in the Tonghua Iron and Steel Base from more than a dozen cities and counties in a very short period of time. On the iron smelting front, the iron and steel fighters from government agencies, schools, and rural areas have paid arduous labor in order to learn iron smelting, and now they have become veritable iron smelting workers. On the construction sites of iron and steel joint enterprises, thousands of civil construction workers, installers, and furnace builders are speeding up winter construction day and night in the bitter winter cold. They have created many miracles in hard work plus skillful work and a large-scale technical revolution. The creation and vigorous promotion of "rapid welding method," "rapid installation method," and "rapid construction method" on various construction sites have increased construction efficiency several times or even more than ten times, making the entire base present a glorious leap forward scene.

    壮丽的长白山区矗立起雄伟的钢铁之城
    通化钢铁基地加快建设
    本报讯　吉林省在全民炼钢铁的基础上，采取“两条腿走路”的方针，正在建设以通化钢铁联合企业为中心的新型的通化钢铁基地。这个基地建成后，将担负吉林省今年钢铁生产任务的绝大部分，为完成全国今年产钢一千八百万吨的光荣任务献出力量。
    通化地区在吉林省东南部。属于长白山区。境内蕴藏着极为丰富的各种矿产，其中煤、铁的储量都在数亿吨以上。松花江、鸭绿江、浑江等十几条江河流贯全区，水量充足，提供了巨大的动力能量。全区铁路稠密，交通方便。这一切都为建立钢铁基地、发展钢铁工业生产提供了极为有利的条件。这个地区在去年开始的全民大搞钢铁运动中，不仅建起五千多座小土炉和土洋结合的炼铁炉，而且还建起来上百座的小高炉。1958年第四季度，中共通化地委根据中共吉林省委的指示，对“小土群”普遍进行了整顿、巩固和提高，将分散的“小土群”组成了数十处大小不同的炼铁厂，决定在通化、七道沟、浑江、大栗子四个原有高炉群的基础上，再新建四座小型钢铁联合企业，连同最先兴建的通化钢铁联合企业，构成一个有相当规模的通化钢铁基地。在这个基地里，五个大小钢铁联合企业是骨干，分别建有十三到二百五十五立方公尺的高炉的炼铁厂，十二到六十吨的转炉和平炉的炼钢厂，小型和中型的轧钢厂，以及中型和大型焦化厂。其中通化钢铁联合企业建成后，年产能力可达八十万吨生铁，一百万吨钢，八十万吨钢材，五万吨无缝钢管，一百八十万吨焦炭。此外，数十座改造后的土高炉也是这个钢铁基地的重要组成部分，它们将作为各钢铁联合企业的卫星厂，大量提供炼钢轧钢的原料。
    大型企业与中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产与土法生产同时并举的方针，使这个钢铁基地的建设速度大大加快。这里的数十座炼铁厂都是因陋就简用土办法建起来的。在建设过程中，红砖不足，群众便自己动手托坯烧砖；耐火砖不足，就多方寻找代用材料用土办法制造；鼓风设备不足，群众就自己动手大搞木制鼓风机，在很短时间内，全区赶制出数千台各式鼓风机，突破了材料、设备不足的困难。已经动工修建和正在筹建的十三到二百五十五立方公尺的高炉，根据边设计、边施工、边生产的原则，正在齐头并进。目前已有二十三座新建的十三到二十八立方公尺的高炉陆续投入生产。作为通化钢铁基地中心的通化钢铁联合企业，炼铁厂第一期工程正在收尾，两座二百五十五立方公尺的高炉、五座热风炉、两座洗涤塔和数十公尺高的烟筒已经耸向高空，炼钢厂、小型轧钢厂和焦化厂也已全面动工。浑江、七道沟、大栗子等小型钢铁联合企业，也同中型企业齐步前进。为钢铁生产服务的四个铁矿和五个煤矿也在土洋并举的方针下加速进行开采。连结各矿山、工厂的基地交通运输网已经构成。新修的三条大铁路、两条轻便铁路、三条标准公路和三条简易公路已全线通车。
    在1959年进一步贯彻以钢为纲方针中，全省有将近十五万钢铁大军已在很短时间内，由十几个市县迅速集中到通化钢铁基地。在炼铁战线上，来自机关、学校、农村的钢铁战士，为了学会炼铁，付出了艰苦的劳动，现在他们都成了名副其实的炼铁工人了。在钢铁联合企业的工地上，成千上万的土建工人、安装工人和筑炉工人正冒着深冬的寒风昼夜加速冬季施工。他们在苦干加巧干，大搞技术革命中，创造了许多奇迹。在各个工地上“快速焊接法”、“快速安装法”、“快速施工法”的创造和大力推广，使施工效率几倍甚至十几倍地提高。使整个基地呈现出一幅光辉的跃进景象。　（申曰营）（附图片）
