    Appearing After Being Well-Groomed
    Qin Li
    Before the content of an article is seen, the title first catches the reader's eye. Whether the title is general or attractive can influence the reader's interest in reading the article. Of course, if the article itself is not good, a good title will be of no avail; but if the article is good and the title is not, it is a pity. An article, like an actor, needs to be well-groomed in all aspects before appearing, such as logic, grammar, rhetoric, punctuation, etc. As the name suggests, the title is the face of an article, how can it be treated casually?
    Are book and play review titles limited to "After Reading" or "After Watching"? Such titles are almost dispensable. Essay titles often start with "Starting from Such and Such"; otherwise, they are "Thoughts on the Spring Festival" or "Thoughts on Children's Day." They may have served some excellent essays, but their overuse makes people feel that the author has not put much thought into the title. The titles of papers seem difficult to escape from statements like "Implement..." or "Must Strive for..." While these statements may still be necessary at times, it cannot be said that there is no room for creativity here.
    Everyone will remember some of the outstanding commentary titles from the anti-rightist struggle. "Why is this?" A good question! Righteous and forceful, making sophistry difficult. "The Workers Have Spoken," how concise and powerful! And, "An Unusual Spring," can't political commentary have a "literary" title? These titles are vivid, but also accurate, and appropriate for the articles. Detached from the content of the article, the one-sided pursuit of novelty and exaggeration is bound to fail. Just as grooming is necessary, but one must pay attention to the appropriate degree of intensity, so as not to backfire.

    打扮好了出场
    秦犁
    在文章内容被人看到以前，题目先入读者眼帘。题目一般化还是吸引人，可能左右读者的对文章的阅读兴趣。固然，文章本身不好，安上一个好题目，也无济于事；但文章好而题目不好，就未免令人惋惜了。文章像演员一样，需要从各方面打扮好了出场，比如逻辑、语法、修辞、标点符号等。顾名思义，题目为一篇眉目，怎能随便对付呢？
    书评、剧评的题目难道只能是某书“读后”，某剧“观后”吗？这样的题目几乎可有可无。杂文的题目往往是“从什么什么说起”；再不然便是“春节有感”，“儿童节有感”。它们也许曾经为一些精彩的杂文服务过，但是用得多了，便使人觉得作者没有在题目上好好地用一番心思。论文的题目好像不容易脱出“贯彻执行……”，“应该”或“必须为……而奋斗”的说法，在必要时这些说法也还有采用的必要，但决不能说，这里就没有发挥创造性的余地了。
    大家都会记得反右斗争中的一些出色的评论题目。“这是为什么？”问得好！义正词严，狡辩为难。“工人说话了”，多么简洁，又多么有力！还有，“不平常的春天”，政治评论难道不可以有一个“文学”的题目？这些题目是生动的，但也是准确的，对文章来说，是贴切的。离开了文章内容，片面地追求新奇，夸张，那是要失败的。正如打扮是需要的，却不能不注意浓淡得体，以免弄巧成拙。
