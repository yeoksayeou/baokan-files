    Commonly Used Seed Selection Methods
    Winnowing: The purpose is to use wind power to blow away inferior seeds (light seeds) and weeds and impurities mixed in the seeds; some severely diseased and insect-infested grains, such as rice blast in rice and scab in wheat, can also be blown away during winnowing. The force should be even when shaking the winnowing machine, otherwise the quality of the selected seeds will be uneven.
    Screening: Screening can separate large and small grains and remove some entrained matter and some small diseased grains (such as wheat nematode galls), but it is not easy to separate light and heavy grains, and insect-eaten and diseased grains are also difficult to remove.
    Hand-picking: Hand-picking is seed-by-seed selection. Because it takes a lot of time, it is generally suitable for seeds with large grains, such as beans, peanuts, corn, and cotton seeds.
    Clear Water Selection: Put the seeds in a bamboo basket, wash them in clear water, and remove the light and shriveled grains that float to the top.
    Salt Water Selection (Mud Water or Ammonium Sulfate Water Selection): Salt water (mud water, ammonium sulfate water) is heavier than clear water and has greater buoyancy, which can remove more shriveled grains, insect-eaten grains, and weed seeds from the seeds. However, it is important to note that different crop seeds should be matched with different salt water concentrations. For example, when selecting rice seeds, add 15 to 25 jin of salt per 100 jin of water; when selecting wheat seeds, add 20 to 30 jin per 100 jin of water. After salt water selection, rinse with clean water (rice seeds can be soaked and sprouted after being rinsed; wheat seeds should be spread out to dry before sowing after being rinsed). Salt water selection is not suitable for large-grained seeds such as beans and peanuts. In areas where ammonium sulfate is commonly used, ammonium sulfate water can be used to replace salt water for seed selection, and the remaining solution can also be used as fertilizer.
    Before the seeds are finely selected, they should be placed in the sun to dry. The drying time can be one to three days depending on the size of the seeds and the amount of water they contain. This can enhance the vitality of the seeds and promote seed germination. (Attached picture)

### 选种常用方法

    选种常用方法
    风选：目的在于用风力把劣种（量轻的种子）和夹在种子里的杂草杂质吹掉；一部分受病虫害严重的籽粒，如水稻的稻热病和小麦的赤?病等籽粒，在风选时也可以吹掉。摇动风车时力量要均匀，否则选出的种子质量不一。
    筛选：筛选能分别大小粒，去掉一些夹杂物和一部分细小的病粒
  （如小麦线虫病瘿等），但不易分开轻粒和重粒，虫蛀和带病的籽粒也较难剔去。
    拣选：拣选就是粒选。因为费时较多，一般适用于子粒大的种子，像豆类、花生、玉米和棉籽。
    清水选种：把种子盛在箩筐里，放在清水中淘选，把漂浮起来的轻粒和瘪粒捞出去。
    盐水选种（泥水或硫铵水选种）：盐水（泥水、硫铵水）比清水重，浮力比清水大，可以除掉种子中较多的瘪粒、虫粒及杂草籽等。但要注意不同的作物种子，要配合不同的盐水浓度。例如选水稻种子时，每百斤水中加食盐十五到二十五斤；选小麦种子时，每百斤水中要加二十到三十斤。盐水选种后要用清水洗净（水稻种洗净后即可浸种催芽；小麦洗净后，要摊开晾干后，才可播种）。豆类、花生等大颗粒的种子不适用盐水选种。在施用硫铵有习惯的地方，可用硫铵水来代替食盐水选种、剩下的溶液还可用作肥料。
    种子在精选以前，应该放在太阳下晒种，晒的时间，可以根据种子的大小和含的水分多少分别晒一天到三天，这样能够增强种子的生活力，促进种子发芽。（附图片）
