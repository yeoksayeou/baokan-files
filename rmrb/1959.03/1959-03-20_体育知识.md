    Skeet Shooting
    Skeet shooting, also known as clay pigeon shooting, was included as a major shooting competition item as early as the Second Olympic Games in 1900. At that time, there were two types of competitions: live pigeon and clay pigeon shooting, but currently only clay pigeon shooting competitions are held. The so-called clay pigeon is not actually a pigeon made of clay, but a disc-shaped object made of a mixture of asphalt and plaster, 11 cm in diameter and nearly 3 cm high. During the competition, these disc-shaped objects are thrown into the air by a trap machine from a trench 15 meters away from the shooter. The shooter must immediately shoot at it with a double-barreled shotgun. Each clay pigeon is thrown out one at a time, but the direction is uncertain (left, middle, right). Within about four seconds from the time it is thrown out to the time it falls to the ground (flying about 70 meters), the shooter can fire two consecutive shots at it in a standing position. In the competition, the more clay pigeons hit, the better the score.
    In current international competitions, shooters shoot 200 or 300 clay pigeons, but some also shoot 100. China held a demonstration competition of shooting 200 clay pigeons in 1956, and the best score at that time was 173 hits (the current world's best score is 196 hits). In this 1959 National Hunter Shooting Competition, the number of clay pigeons shot is 50. Shooters take turns shooting, and the length of the shooting time (number of days) is determined according to the number of shooters participating in the competition. The standard for a first-class shooter is 40 hits, and for a second-class shooter, it is 33 hits (there are no standards for Master of Sports and third-class shooters). The national record for this event—47 clay pigeons hit—was set by Lu Houqing from Heilongjiang on March 20, 1958, in Guangzhou.
    Running Deer Shooting
    Running deer shooting is also one of the main competition items in international shooting competitions. During the competition, the shooter must stand 100 meters away and shoot at a running deer target with a military rifle. The running deer is made of wood and is about the same size as a real deer. A target ring is drawn on its heart, and the smallest ring is 15 cm in diameter, scoring five points when hit. This fake deer is electrically operated, and the shooter only has a chance to shoot during the brief four seconds each time it passes through the 23-meter-long open area. This competition is divided into two types: 50 single shots and 25 double shots (firing two bullets in four seconds). Each type is conducted in groups, rather than shooting all the bullets at once. The score with the most hits on the rings is the best.
    In this 1959 National Hunter Shooting Competition, 50 single-shot competitions are held. These 50 bullets are shot in three groups of 20, 20, and 10, and the number of days for shooting is determined by the number of shooters participating in the competition. The current world record for this event is 234 rings (full ring is 250 rings), created by Soviet athlete Nikitin at the 37th World Shooting Championships in August 1958. The Chinese record is 217 rings, created by Tan Binggong of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing on August 14, 1958. The standard for Master of Sports in this event is 215 rings, and for a first-class shooter, it is 195 rings.　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)

    飞碟射击
    飞碟射击也叫泥鸽射击，早在1900年的第二届奥林匹克运动会上，它就被列为主要射击竞赛项目之一。但当时还分活鸽和泥鸽射击两种比赛，而目前只举行泥鸽射击比赛。所谓泥鸽，实际上并不是泥做的鸽子，而是用沥青和石膏混合做的直径十一公分、高近三公分的碟状物。在比赛时，这些碟状物由离射手十五公尺远的靶沟中被抛靶器抛向空中后，射手就要立刻用双管猎枪向它射击。飞碟每一次抛出一个，但方向不定（分左、中、右），在它从被抛出到落地的约四秒钟内（约飞行七十公尺），射手可用站立姿态向它连发两枪。在比赛中，命中飞碟越多，成绩越好。
    在目前的国际比赛中，射手射击飞碟的数目有二百和三百个的，但也有射一百个的。中国在1956年曾经举行过射二百个飞碟的表演赛，当时最好的成绩是命中一百七十三个（目前的世界最好成绩是命中一百九十六个）。这次在1959年全国猎手射击竞赛中，射击飞碟的数目是五十个，射手轮流进行射击，按参加比赛射手人数的多少，决定射完时间（天数）的长短。一级射手的标准是命中四十个，二级射手是命中三十三个（无运动健将和三级射手标准）。这个项目的全国纪录——命中四十七个飞碟，是黑龙江选手鲁厚庆1958年3月20日在广州创造的。
    跑鹿射击
    跑鹿射击也是国际射击比赛中的主要竞赛项目之一。在比赛时，射手要站在一百公尺以外用军用步枪向跑鹿靶射击。跑鹿是用木板制的，大小同真鹿差不多，在它的心脏部分画有靶环，最小的一个环直径是十五公分，命中后可得五分。这个假鹿是用电操纵的，在它每次通过长二十三公尺开阔地带的暂短的四秒钟内，射手才有机会射击。这种比赛分五十次单发射和二十五次双发射（在四秒钟内射两发子弹）两种。每种都分组进行，而不是把子弹一气射完。命中环数最多的成绩最好。
    这次在1959年全国猎手射击竞赛中，是举行五十次单发射比赛。这五十发子弹分二十发、二十发、十发三组三次射完，射完的天数，由参加比赛的射手人数多少来决定。目前这个项目的世界纪录，是苏联选手尼基京1958年8月在第三十七届世界射击锦标赛中创造的二百三十四环（满环二百五十环）。中国纪录是解放军选手谭炳贡1958年8月14日在北京创造的二百一十七环。这个项目的运动健将标准是二百一十五环，一级射手是一百九十五环。　　　　　　（新华社）
