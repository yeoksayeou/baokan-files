    Everyone Has a Plan
    Nanning, 4th (of this month) - The Wanzhang Work Zone of the Shangyou People's Commune in Luchuan County has mobilized the masses to formulate a production leap forward plan even greater than that of 1958. Furthermore, every household has drawn up a family plan to execute the work zone's plan, and everyone has a work attendance plan. The work zone's production plan stipulates that early rice will universally use high-yield varieties, greatly increase fertilizer application, and coupled with deep plowing and close planting, strive to achieve a yield of 5,000 jin per mu for rice throughout the year. Specialized teams will be organized to uniformly manage various industries and sideline occupations. In terms of the masses' lives, collective canteens should be improved, with one pig raised for every seven people; in addition, large numbers of chickens and fish should be raised.
    Based on the work zone's production plan, every household and every individual also makes plans. The content includes income plans, work attendance plans, and family or individual consumption plans. With production and living plans, the direction for the commune members to advance is specific and clear. Everyone is full of enthusiasm, and everywhere there are discussions between brothers, sisters-in-law, husbands and wives, and fathers and sons, all jointly establishing great ambitions for the leap forward.
