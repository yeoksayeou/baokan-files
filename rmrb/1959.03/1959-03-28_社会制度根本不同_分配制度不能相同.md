Editor's Note: The term "bourgeois right" originated from the Chinese translation of Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program." Now, after research by the CCP Central Bureau for the Compilation and Translation of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's Works on the original German text, as well as Russian, English, and Japanese translations of this sentence, it has been proven that this translation is inaccurate. A more accurate translation would be "bourgeois-style right." Therefore, this discussion column in our newspaper should also be corrected accordingly.

Fundamentally Different Social Systems: Different Distribution Systems
Li Guangcan

After reading Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's article on eliminating bourgeois-style rights on January 27th, I believe his main argument is incorrect. His incorrect view mainly stems from his misunderstanding of the socialist principle of distribution according to labor as also being a capitalist principle of distribution. That is, he believes that in terms of distribution principles, socialism is the same as capitalism, both distributing according to labor. From this erroneous fundamental point, he has derived other erroneous views.

What bourgeois-style right is reflected in distribution according to labor? This is the central point of discussion with Comrade Jiqiao. He believes that equivalent exchange measured by labor is both a bourgeois-style right reflecting general equivalent exchange of commodities (this is correct) and a bourgeois-style right reflecting the capitalist distribution system (this is wrong).

Why do I say that Comrade Jiqiao's view of the capitalist distribution system as equivalent exchange measured by labor is wrong?

The Essence of Bourgeois-Style Right is the Existence of Inequality

First, as far as the distribution system is concerned, Marx and Lenin both regarded the unavoidable existence of certain inequalities in the implementation of distribution according to labor as a bourgeois-style right, rather than equivalent exchange itself measured by labor. If, like Comrade Jiqiao, one believes that the bourgeois-style right manifested in the distribution system is the latter (of course, his opinion also includes the former), then naturally, the entire principle of distribution according to labor can only be a bourgeois-style right; it is not that the distribution according to labor contains bourgeois-style right! To facilitate explaining this issue, I will now quote a passage from Lenin that Comrade Jiqiao once quoted: "But it (referring to bourgeois-style right - Author's note) still remains in another respect, as the regulator (determinant) allotting products and apportioning labor among the members of society. 'He who does not work, neither shall he eat'—this socialist principle is already realized; 'An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor'—this socialist principle is also already realized. However, this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish 'bourgeois-style right,' which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products." (Lenin: "State and Revolution") Here, (1) "He who does not work, neither shall he eat," Lenin described as a socialist principle of distribution, which is not a bourgeois-style right, because the capitalist principle of distribution is not "He who does not work, neither shall he eat;" (2) "An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor," Lenin also described as a socialist principle of distribution, which is also not a bourgeois-style right, because the capitalist principle of distribution is also not "An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor;" (3) Only when implementing "an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor" and encountering situations where different individuals receive equal amounts of products for unequal amounts of labor, that is, when encountering de facto inequalities, does Lenin call it a bourgeois-style right (because the capitalist principle of distribution includes all extreme inequalities, and naturally includes these non-extreme inequalities). It is very clear here that, as far as the distribution system is concerned, two out of three are not bourgeois-style rights; only in the third situation does a bourgeois-style right exist. Thus, Lenin's reference to bourgeois-style right is to the existence of substantial inequality, so it can only be a remnant in the "distribution according to labor" principle; while Comrade Jiqiao's reference to bourgeois-style right in the distribution system is to equivalent exchange measured by labor, that is, formal equality, so it naturally becomes the entirety of the entire "distribution according to labor" principle. I believe Lenin's opinion is correct.

Equivalent Exchange Measured by Labor is not a Bourgeois-Style Right

Second, it is true that the meaning of "according to labor" in the principle of distribution according to labor is to adopt "the form of equivalent exchange measured by labor" to distribute consumer goods. However, is "equivalent exchange measured by labor" itself a bourgeois-style right in the distribution system? Comrade Jiqiao believes it is; I hold a different opinion.

First of all, equivalent exchange measured by labor is not a bourgeois-style right in the distribution system, because: (1) Equivalent exchange measured by labor is a general principle of commodity exchange (this principle of commodity exchange began to appear in slave society), not a capitalist principle of distribution. (2) The capitalist principle of distribution is not only not equivalent exchange measured by labor, but is fundamentally opposed to it, because the characteristics of the capitalist distribution system fully reflect the nature of capitalist class exploitation. It is specifically manifested as: first, capitalists who own the means of production gain much without working; second, the vast majority of workers who do not own the means of production gain little despite working hard. The capitalists' remuneration to the workers (distribution through the form of wages) is an extremely unequal exchange for the workers' labor, and therefore is not measured by labor. The examples listed by Comrade Jiqiao of capitalists giving workers "money according to the amount of work they do" (this is not equivalent exchange, but unequal exchange where more labor yields less gain, because capitalists must extract surplus value from all workers, "extracting more with more work, and relatively less with less work"), "or paying according to the labor day or the quantity of products, giving more for more work and less for less work," are precisely not equivalent exchange measured by labor. Marx had already pointed out these issues long ago; distribution according to labor is only possible in a society where the means of production are publicly owned, that is, on the basis of "the material conditions of production being the collective property of the workers themselves." (Marx: "Critique of the Gotha Program").

Secondly, although the form of equivalent exchange measured by labor is only possible in the distribution system in socialist society, is "equivalent exchange measured by labor" itself a new category created in socialist society? No! It is not only not a new category created in socialist society, but it is also not a category created in capitalist society. It began to emerge very early, when the social phenomenon of simple commodity exchange appeared. At that time, it could only be used to a limited extent in the general field of commodity exchange. In capitalist society, after commodity production and commodity exchange became the ruling form of society, although it is impossible to implement it in the capitalist distribution system, it can play its regulatory role even more in the general field of commodity exchange. Therefore, this "form of equivalent exchange measured by labor" that accompanies the emergence of simple commodity economy belongs to the capitalist category when it reaches capitalist society. Only in this sense is it a bourgeois-style right (as Marx mentioned in the "Critique of the Gotha Program"). But this is another meaning. This is different from the meaning of the bourgeois-style right in socialist distribution according to labor that people often speak of (referring to the inequality in content and substance, and therefore it can only be a remnant rather than a large amount, much less the entirety), these are two different issues. We cannot confuse these two issues, and we cannot confuse the essence and content (remnants of inequality) of bourgeois-style right in the distribution system with the form of bourgeois-style right (the concept of "equivalent exchange measured by labor") that is generally used by socialist society. Only by distinguishing the two clearly can we avoid mistakenly regarding the main principle of socialist distribution—distribution according to labor—as retaining the bourgeois-style right in the distribution system, and as inheriting or using the capitalist distribution system.

I believe that the remnants of bourgeois-style right in the essence of the distribution system that are retained by the principle of distribution according to labor are not manifested in the form of equivalent exchange measured by labor, that is, the "distribution according to labor" issue, but are manifested in the unavoidable existence of certain inequalities in life when implementing distribution according to labor. The concept of equivalent exchange measured by labor, which embodies general commodity exchange and is utilized by socialist society, belongs to the capitalist category and the general category of bourgeois-style right. In this sense, Marx and Lenin called it bourgeois-style right, but it is not a category of the capitalist distribution system, and therefore is not a bourgeois-style right reflecting the capitalist distribution system.

Socialist Distribution According to Labor Carries Remnants of Bourgeois Right

In addition to the erroneous view of regarding the form of equivalent exchange measured by labor as the entire bourgeois-style right in the distribution system, another reason why Comrade Zheng Jiqiao came to the conclusion of regarding "distribution according to labor" as both the main principle of socialist distribution and the principle of capitalist distribution is that Comrade Jiqiao has severed the organic connection between the distribution system and the system of ownership (what kind of ownership determines what kind of distribution system). He has isolated the distribution system from the foundation of ownership. Although he believes that capitalism and socialism are fundamentally different in terms of the system of ownership (which is of course correct), because he erroneously believes that the distribution system can exist independently of the system of ownership, it naturally gives him more reason, under the influence of the first erroneous view (that is, regarding the entire "distribution according to labor" as a bourgeois-style right), to make his erroneous argument: although capitalism and socialism are fundamentally different in terms of the system of ownership, they can have a common distribution system—distribution according to labor.

The distribution system of a certain society is determined by two important aspects of the relations of production in that society: the ownership relations (which is the foundation) and its level of development of the productive forces. When discussing the distribution system: when comparing one socio-economic form with another, for example, comparing capitalism with socialism, the most decisive factor to emphasize first is the role of ownership in the relations of production in determining its distribution system, followed by the role played by the level of development of the productive forces. Otherwise, we would not be able to explain why, under the current conditions where our country's productive forces are still lower than those of the United States, we are able to implement distribution according to labor, while the United States cannot implement it at all. However, if comparing two stages of development of the same socio-economic form, for example, comparing socialism with communism, because the system of ownership in the relations of production has already been resolved (that is, socialism and communism have essentially the same ownership foundation—the public ownership foundation), it should be emphasized that the level of development of the productive forces plays a significant decisive role in which distribution system is adopted. Engels's statement that "the distribution arrangements depend essentially on the quantity of products to be distributed" (Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin: "On Communist Society") is directed at comparing socialist distribution according to labor with communist distribution according to need. But if comparing the socialist distribution system with the capitalist distribution system, one should first emphasize that the distribution system of each society is determined by the ownership system of each society, and one should not disregard ownership and simply make a case from the development of productive forces. Comrade Jiqiao's article does just that; he actually denies the decisive relationship of social ownership to social distribution. This erroneous conclusion further leads Comrade Jiqiao to juxtapose communist distribution according to need with socialist distribution according to labor (naturally, this is also an opposition, but it is an opposition in another sense—the opposition in the universality of dialectical opposition and unity). In his view, this opposition is also the opposition between communist distribution according to need and the capitalist distribution system (because he believes that distribution according to labor is also the capitalist distribution system!). Thus, in analyzing the distribution system, Comrade Jiqiao on the one hand confuses the essential differences between socialism and capitalism; on the other hand, he severs the essential connection between socialism and communism.

The correct view should be: socialism and capitalism are not only fundamentally different in terms of the system of ownership, but also fundamentally different in terms of the distribution system determined by each ownership system (are two essentially different societies and the opposite of two systems), but due to the limitations of certain socio-historical conditions, the socialist distribution according to labor system simultaneously carries the remnants of bourgeois-style rights. The socialist principle of equality of distribution according to labor is opposed to the capitalist principle of exploitation of non-distribution according to labor. As for distribution according to need, although there is also a difference in principle from distribution according to labor, the difference between them is essentially different from the fundamental opposition between the capitalist distribution system and the socialist distribution according to labor system, because they are both produced on the same foundation of public ownership.

专栏：

    编者按　“资产阶级法权”一语源出于马克思的“哥达纲领批判”一书的中文译本。现在经过中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局对德文原本以及俄文、英文和日文译本中这句话的研究，证明这种译法是不确当的，比较准确的译法应该是“资产阶级式的权利”。因此，本报这一讨论的栏目也应作相应的改正。
    社会制度根本不同　分配制度不能相同
    李光灿
    看了1月27日郑季翘同志讨论削除资产阶级式的权利的文章，我认为他的主要论点是不正确的。他的不正确的看法主要是：他把社会主义的按劳分配原则误认为也是资本主义的分配原则，就是说，在分配原则上，社会主义同资本主义一样，都是按劳分配。他从这一错误的基本点出发又产生了其它一些错误的看法。
    反映在按劳分配中的资产阶级式的权利是什么？这是和季翘同志讨论的中心。他认为：以劳动为尺度的等价交换本身，既是反映一般商品等价交换的资产阶级式的权利（这一点是对的），也是反映资本主义分配制度的资产阶级式的权利（这一点是错的）。
    为什么说季翘同志把资本主义分配制度看成是以劳动为尺度的等价交换是错误的呢？
    资产阶级式的权利实质上是不平等现象的存在
    第一，作为分配制度来说，马克思和列宁都是把在实行按劳分配中还不可免的存在着某些不平等这一点看作是资产阶级式的权利，而不是指以劳动为尺度的等价交换本身。如果像季翘同志那样认为在分配制度上资产阶级式的权利所表现的就是后者（当然他的意见同时也包括了前者），这样，自然，整个按劳分配原则只能是资产阶级式的权利了，就不是在按劳分配中包含有资产阶级式的权利了！为便于说明这个问题，现在我来引用季翘同志曾经引用过的列宁的一段话：“但是它（指资产阶级式的权利——笔者注）在另一方面却依然存在，依然是社会各个成员间分配产品和分配劳动的调节者（决定者）。‘不劳动者不得食’这个社会主义原则已经实现了；‘按等量劳动领取等量产品’这个社会主义原则也已经实现了。但是，这还不是共产主义，还没有消除不同的人按不等量的（事实上是不等量的）劳动领取等量产品的‘资产阶级式的权利’。”（列宁：“国家与革命”）在这里，（一）“不劳动者不得食”，列宁说成是社会主义的分配原则，这不是资产阶级式的权利，因为资本主义的分配原则并不是“不劳动者不得食”；（二）“按等量劳动领取等量产品”，列宁也说成是社会主义的分配原则，这也不是资产阶级式的权利，因为资本主义的分配原则也并不是“按等量劳动领取等量产品”；（三）只有在实行“按等量劳动领取等量产品”时遇到不同的人按不等量的劳动领取等量产品的情况下，即遇到事实上的不平等出现时，列宁才把它叫做资产阶级式的权利（因为在资本主义分配原则中，包括了一切极端的不平等，自然也包括这类不极端的不平等了）。这里很清楚，作为分配制度来说，在三条中有两条不是资产阶级式的权利，只有在第三条的情况下才存在资产阶级式的权利。可见，列宁所指的资产阶级式的权利，是实质上的不平等现象的存在，因此它在“按劳分配”原则中只能是残余；而季翘同志所指的在分配制度上的资产阶级式的权利，是以劳动为尺度的等价交换，即形式上的平等，因此它自然就成为整个“按劳分配”原则的全部了。我认为，列宁的意见是对的。
    以劳动为尺度的等价交换不是资产阶级式的权利
    第二，不错，按劳分配原则中“按劳”分配的意思，就是采取“以劳动为尺度的等价交换形式”来进行对消费品的分配。但是，“以劳动为尺度的等价交换”本身，是否就是在分配制度上的资产阶级式的权利呢？季翘同志认为是，我持不同的意见。
    首先，以劳动为尺度的等价交换不是在分配制度上的资产阶级式的权利。因为：（一）以劳动为尺度的等价交换，是一般商品交换的原则（从奴隶社会起这种商品交换原则就开始出现了），不是资本主义的分配原则。（二）资本主义分配原则不但不是以劳动为尺度进行等价交换，而是相反地同它根本对立，因为资本主义分配制度的特点充分反映了资本主义阶级剥削的性质，它具体表现为：一是占有生产资料的资本家不劳多获；二是没有生产资料的工人大众多劳少获，资本家对工人的报酬（通过工资形式所进行的分配）是他们对工人的劳动所进行的极不等价的交换，因此也就不是以劳动为尺度。季翘同志所列举的资本家对工人“做多少活，给多少钱”（这不是等价交换，而是多劳少获的不等价交换，因为资本家对一切工人都要榨取剩余价值，“多做活多榨取，少做活相对地少榨取”）、“或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给”等，恰恰都不是以劳动为尺度的等价交换。对于这些问题，马克思早在按劳分配只有在生产资料公有制的社会里，即在“物质的生产条件将是工人自己的集体财产。”（马克思：“哥达纲领批判”）的基础上，才有可能实行。
    其次，固然，以劳动为尺度的等价交换形式，被用在分配制度上，只有到社会主义社会时才有可能；但“以劳动为尺度的等价交换”本身是不是在社会主义社会产生的新范畴呢？不！它不但不是社会主义社会产生的新范畴，而且也不是资本主义社会产生的范畴，而是在很早以前，即在简单商品交换的社会现象出现时就开始产生了这个概念，那时它只能有限度地被用在一般商品交换领域中，到了资本主义社会，商品生产和商品交换成为社会的统治形式后，虽然在资本主义分配制度上它不可能实行，但在一般商品交换领域中，它却更能发挥自己的调节作用。因此，这个伴随着简单商品经济出现的“以劳动为尺度的等价交换形态”，到了资本主义社会，它便属于资本主义范畴。只有在这个意义上讲，它是资产阶级式的权利（如马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中所提的那样）。但这是另外一个意思，这同人们经常所说的社会主义按劳分配中带有资产阶级式的权利（指在内容和实质上的不平等，因此也只能是残余而不是大量的更不是全部）的含意是两个问题，是两回事。我们不能把这两个问题混淆起来，不能把在分配制度上的资产阶级式的权利实质和内容（不平等的残余）同在一般概念上被社会主义社会所运用利资产阶级式的权利形式（“以劳动为尺度的等价交换”的这个概念）混淆起来。只有把二者分别清楚，才不致把社会主义的主要分配原则——按劳分配，错误地当做是保留了在分配制度上的资产阶级式的权利当做是继承了或者说沿用了资本主义的分配制度。
    我认为，按劳分配原则所保留的在分配制度本质上的资产阶级式的权利的残余，并不表现在以劳动为尺度的等价交换形态即“按劳”分配问题上，而是表现在在实行按劳分配中还不可避免地存在着生活上的某些不平等上。被社会主义社会所利用的以劳动为尺度的等价交换这个体现一般商品交换的概念，是属于资本主义范畴和一般资产阶级式的权利范畴，在这个意义上，马克思和列宁才称它为资产阶级式的权利，但它不是资本主义分配制度的范畴，因而也不是反映资本主义分配制度的资产阶级式的权利。
        社会主义按劳分配带有资产阶级权利的残余
    除了把以劳动为尺度的等价交换形式当作是在分配制度上的整个资产阶级式的权利这个错误看法以外，郑季翘同志所以得出了把“按劳分配”既看成是社会主义的主要分配原则又看成是资本主义的分配原则这个结论，还有另外的原因，那就是季翘同志把分配制和所有制之间的有机联系（什么样的所有制决定着什么样的分配制）割裂了，他把分配制从所有制基础上孤立地抽取出来，他虽然认为在所有制基础上，资本主义同社会主义根本不同（这当然是对的），但因为他错误地认为分配制可以脱离所有制而孤立存在，所以就使他在头一个错误看法（即把“按劳”分配整个看成是资产阶级式的权利）的支配下，自然更有理由来作出他这样的错误立论了：虽然资本主义和社会主义在所有制上根本不同，但却可以有共同的分配制度——按劳分配。
    一定社会的分配制度，由一定社会的生产关系中的所有制关系（这是基础）和它的生产力发展水平这两个重要方面所决定。在论起分配制度来：以一种社会经济形态同另一种社会经济形态相比较，例如以资本主义同社会主义相比较，首先应当强调的是生产关系中的所有制对它的分配制起着最决定的作用，其次才是生产力发展水平所起的作用。否则我们就不好去说明：何以我国目前在生产力还低于美国的条件下，我们能够实行按劳分配制，而美国却根本不能实行。然而，如果以同一的社会经济形态的两个发展阶段相比较，例如以社会主义和共产主义相比较，因为在生产关系中的所有制已经得到解决（即社会主义和共产主义在本质上有着同一个所有制基础——公有制基础）的前提下，就应当强调生产力的发展水平对采用哪一种分配制才起着显著的决定作用。恩格斯所说的“分配方式在很大程度上取决于所被分配的产品数量。”（马、恩、列、斯：“论共产主义社会”）就是针对着拿社会主义按劳分配同共产主义按需分配相比较的情况下来说的。但如果拿社会主义分配制同资本主义分配制相比较，就应当首先强调各该社会的分配制被各该社会的所有制来决定，而不应当抛开所有制不管，单从生产力发展方面作文章。季翘同志的文章正是这样作的，他实际上否定了社会所有制对社会分配制的决定的关系。这个错误结论就进一步引导着季翘同志把共产主义按需分配同社会主义按劳分配对立起来（自然这也是对立的，但它是另一种意义上的对立——辩证法对立统一的普遍性意义上的对立）。在他看来，这种对立，同时也就是以共产主义的按需分配同资本主义分配制度的对立（因为他认为按劳分配也是资本主义的分配制度吗！）。这样，在分析分配制度上，季翘同志就一方面混淆了社会主义同资本主义的本质区别；另一方面割裂了社会主义同共产主义的本质联系。
    正确的看法应当是：社会主义和资本主义，不仅在所有制基础上根本不同，而且在被各该所有制基础所决定的分配制上也根本不同（是两种本质不同的社会和两种体系的对立物），但由于一定的社会历史条件的限制，社会主义按劳分配制同时带着资产阶级式的权利的残余。按劳分配的社会主义平等原则，是同不按劳分配的资本主义剥削原则相对立的。至于按需分配，虽然同按劳分配也有原则上的区别，但它们之间的区别和资本主义分配制同社会主义按劳分配制之间的根本对立有本质上的不同，因为它们都是在公共所有制同一基础上产生的。
