    Experience in Managing and Operating the Exchange Commune
    Since the establishment of many people's communes, they have already explored a set of relatively mature experiences in management and operation, such as how to strengthen ideological education and improve the production responsibility system. It is recommended that the People's Daily introduce more experiences in these aspects, whether single items or comprehensive ones, and especially welcomes special experience introductions. This will allow for a wide exchange of experience and mutual promotion.

    交流公社的经营管理经验
    不少人民公社成立以来，已经在经营管理方面摸索出一套比较成熟的经验，像如何加强思想教育工作、健全生产责任制等，建议人民日报多介绍这些方面的经验，单项的也好，全面的也好，尤其欢迎专题的经验介绍。这样就可以广泛地交流经验，相互促进。
