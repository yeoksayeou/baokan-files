Recycling and utilizing waste materials should be a regular task, because turning broken and discarded waste into useful wealth for the country is a good thing at any time. Last year, the city collected more than 136,000 tons of scrap steel, which could be used to manufacture more than 19,000 tractors. As for waste paper, the amount collected in just over two months this year can be used to make 8,000 tons of new paper; these papers can be used to print 250 million copies of newspapers. Isn't it a great thing to "turn waste into treasure" and "turn garbage into gold"? What's more, with the current shortage of certain raw materials, fully utilizing these waste materials is of great practical significance for solving the raw material difficulties and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. Some units have partially solved the difficulty of insufficient raw materials by utilizing waste in many ways. According to today's newspaper, Tiangong Abrasives Manufacturing Factory has not received raw materials from the state this year due to the full utilization of waste materials, and production has been increasing month by month. They are determined to strive not to receive raw materials this year and ensure that production doubles. Of course, due to different specific conditions, not all factories can be required to do this, but this spirit of self-reliance and full utilization of waste should be universally promoted.

Because some achievements have been made in the recycling and utilization of waste products in the past, some people have doubts about the potential of waste products. They said: Waste products have been collected for several years, and a large-scale "drought resistance" campaign was carried out last year, so there is not much potential left. These comrades did not see that waste products also "come and go," that is, old waste products are collected, and new waste products are generated. Shanghai is an industrial base and a densely populated metropolis. Every day, a large amount of materials are consumed in industrial production and people's daily lives, which constantly generates a large amount of waste products. Moreover, with the development of production and the improvement of people's living standards, the factory's leftovers and the waste materials discarded in people's lives will also increase accordingly. Besides, the waste was not completely collected last year. Taking waste oil as an example, nearly 1,000 tons of vegetable and mineral oil were recovered and refined last year from the swill of only a few small and medium-sized canteens, restaurants, and individual oil factories. If it were widely collected and refined in more factories and public places, the number would certainly be very large. Take waste paper again. Now there is a shortage of raw materials for papermaking, and almost every household in Shanghai has old newspapers and old books, but no one collects them. It can be seen that there are "treasure houses" of waste materials in many places, waiting for us to further explore and utilize them.

Some people think that these broken and discarded things are not very useful, and it is troublesome to sort them out, so why bother spending so much effort. Obviously, this view is even more incorrect. A piece of waste paper, a piece of rag, a piece of broken glass, a pair of broken rubber shoes, scattered everywhere, are indeed of no use and affect environmental hygiene, but after they are collected, they can accumulate into a huge material force. Waste paper, rags, waste cotton, etc. are all raw materials for the paper industry. Rags and waste cotton can also be woven into cotton blankets after being bleached and recycled. The scraps of cloth left over from tailoring clothes, after chemical treatment and pressing, become tough and wear-resistant rubber cloth, which can replace precious metals such as aluminum and alloy steel to manufacture machine parts, faucets, and sprayers. Some waste products are also important export materials. More than two tons of human hair can be exchanged for a combine harvester. How can you say it's "not very useful"? What does it matter if you are a little "troubled" for increasing so much wealth for the country?

In order to widely mobilize the masses and do a good job in waste product recycling, first of all, the staff of the waste product recycling department are required to boost their morale. On the one hand, they should do a good job in publicity, so that everyone understands that selling waste products and turning useless things into useful things is "a contribution to the country," and at the same time, it is also beneficial to themselves. On the other hand, they should try their best to facilitate residents to sell waste products, ensure reasonable prices, seize both large and small items, take into account both primary and secondary items, and collect whatever is available to expand the scope of purchases. However, due to the characteristics of waste products, such as being scattered, fragmented, complex, and diverse, it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of the purchasing units to do a good job in purchasing. It is necessary to rely on social forces and the strength of the masses. On the basis of doing a good job in ideological work, a mass movement to purchase and sell waste products should be launched throughout the city. Doing so will surely result in collecting more waste products than last year, turning more waste into treasure and garbage into gold. (March 27th, Jiefang Daily Editorial)

### 变废物为黄金

    变废物为黄金
    回收和利用废弃物资，应当是一个经常性的工作，因为把破破烂烂的废物，变成为国家有用的财富，任何时候都是一件好事。去年一年中，本市一共收集了十三万六千多吨废钢铁，如果用来制造拖拉机，可以制成一万九千多台。至于废纸，单今年两个多月里收集的，就可以制造八千吨新纸；拿这些纸来印报，可以印两亿五千万份。这样“变废物为宝贝”，“变垃圾为黄金”，不都是很大的好事吗？何况当前某些原材料供应不足，充分利用这些废弃物资，对解决原材料困难，促进生产大跃进，更有很大的现实意义。有些单位，由于多方面地利用废物，原材料不足的困难已得到部分的解决。据今天报载，天工砂轮制造厂，由于充分利用废料，今年未向国家领取原料，而生产月月提高，他们并决心争取今年不领原料，保证生产翻一番。当然，由于具体条件不同，不能要求所有的工厂都做到这一点，但这种自力更生、充分利用废物的精神则应普遍加以发扬。
    由于过去在回收和利用废品方面做出了一些成绩，有些人就对废品的潜力发生了怀疑。他们说：废品收了好几年，去年又大搞“抗旱”运动，已经没有多大油水了。这些同志没有看到废品也是“有去有来”的，即旧的废品被收走了，新的废品又产生了。上海是一个工业基地，又是一个人口集中的大城市，每天在工业生产上和人民日常生活上都要消耗大量的物资，从而也就不断产生大量的废品。而且随着生产的发展和人民生活水平的提高，工厂的下脚和人民生活中废弃的物资也会相应地增多，何况去年并没有把废弃的东西收集干净。以废油脂为例，去年仅从少数中小食堂、饭馆和个别油厂的泔脚中，就回收和提炼出植物、矿物油近一千吨，如果在更多的工厂和公共场所广泛收集提炼，数字一定是很大的。再拿废纸来说，现在造纸原料不足，而上海的旧报纸、旧书刊，几乎家家都有，就是没有人去收。由此可见，许多地方都存在着废旧物资的“宝库”，有待我们去进一步发掘和利用。
    有些人认为这些破破烂烂的东西，能有多大的用处，整理起来又麻烦，何必花那么大力气。显然，这种看法更是不对的。一张废纸、一块破布、一片碎玻璃、一双破胶鞋，散落各处，确实没啥用处，而且影响环境卫生，但是收集起来以后，就可以聚沙成塔，成为巨大的物质力量。废纸、破布、废棉等都是造纸工业原料，破布、废棉加以漂洗、回弹，还可以织成棉毯。裁剪衣料剩下的碎布，经过化学处理和压制以后，就成为坚韧耐磨的胶布，可以代替铝、合金钢等贵重金属制造机器部件、水龙头和喷雾器等。有些废品还是重要的出口物资，两吨多的人发可以换回一部联合收割机。怎么能说“用处不大”呢？为国家增加这样多的财富，自己稍微“麻烦”一点，又有什么关系呢？
    为了广泛发动群众，做好废品的回收工作，首先要求废品回收部门的工作人员，鼓起干劲，一方面做好宣传工作，使大家都了解，出售废品，变无用为有用，是“功在国家”的事，同时对自己也有好处；一方面想尽办法便利居民出售废品，做到价格合理，大小都抓，主次兼顾，有啥收啥，以扩大收购品种的范围。但是，由于废品具有分散、零星、复杂、多样等特点，要做好收购工作，单靠收购单位的力量是不够的，必须依靠社会力量，群众的力量。应在做好思想工作的基础上，在全市范围内掀起一个收购出售废品的群众运动。这样做一定可以收到比去年更多的废品，使更多的废物变成宝贝，垃圾变成黄金。　（3月27日解放日报社论）
