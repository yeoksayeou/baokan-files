Seeds of Hatred
A letter from Vietnam

Comrade Tian Jian:

I am writing to you with a very painful and angry heart to report the barbaric massacre committed by the American imperialist lackey Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam.

On December 1, 1958, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique poisoned and simultaneously killed more than a thousand patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp in Thu Dau Mot province. This concentration camp holds more than six thousand people. Over the years, due to the extremely savage prison system, hundreds of people have been killed every day. Currently, the remaining four thousand plus lives are in great distress, because the enemy is trying to find ways to kill them with water, shooting, burning down the concentration camp, and trying to scatter them elsewhere.

Comrade Tian Jian, in the past you have exposed the crimes of the American-Chiang and Japanese imperialists in China, and you have also participated in the anti-American struggle in Korea. I believe that when you hear this news, you will be very angry. I hope that you will expose the crimes of American imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem through your creative work. This is the response the Vietnamese people are waiting for!

Vietnamese Poet, Ji Xiang

Response

To Vietnamese Poet Ji Xiang:

Reading your letter, I see on the white paper, every word is hatred. The white paper has turned into sparks, flying and bursting before my eyes; I shout here, this atrocity must be stopped! Hatred is a seed, taking root in the earth; whoever sows this hatred will swallow the bitter fruit himself. I want to say to the concentration camp, to the thousand murdered people, please hold up your blood and drown the evil plague!

    仇恨的种子
    从越南寄来的信田间同志：
    我以非常痛心和愤怒的心情向你报告美帝国主义走狗吴庭艳在越南南部制造的野蛮的屠杀事件。
    1958年12月1日，吴庭艳集团在土龙木省富利集中营放毒药同时杀害一千多个爱国者。这个集中营有六千多人，多少年来由于非常野蛮的监狱制度，每天杀死成百人，目前余下四千多人的生命，人人非常担忧，因为敌人正想办法，用冲水，开枪，烧毁集中营，想把他们分散到别处。
    田间同志，过去你曾经揭露美蒋和日本帝国主义在中国的罪恶，并曾到朝鲜参加过抗美斗争，我相信当你听了这个消息之后，你一定非常愤恨。希望你以创作揭露美帝国主义和吴庭艳的罪恶，这是越南人民等待着的回音！

    信
    田间越南诗人济享：接读你的来信，我看见白纸上，每一个字都是仇恨。白纸化成了火星，在我的眼前飞迸；我在这里高呼，必须制止暴行！仇恨这是种子，在大地上生根；谁种下这仇恨，恶果他自己吞。我要寄语集中营，一千个被害的人，请把鲜血捧起来，淹死万恶的瘟神！
