Dear comrades fighting bravely on the steel front:

Today, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Central People's Broadcasting Station are jointly holding a "National Steel Workers' High-Yield, High-Quality, and All-Round Bumper Harvest Competition Broadcast Meeting." Millions of troops on the steel front are participating in this meeting to tell the Party and Chairman Mao about their ambitions to fight for steel. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend my warmest greetings to you and wish this broadcast meeting to be a great success in further boosting morale and ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's steel tasks.

As everyone knows, 1958 was a year of great leap forward for the whole nation in our country. In this year, we achieved extremely great achievements and extremely rich experience in terms of the transformation of production relations and the development of productive forces, as well as in the growth of the material foundation and the change of the mental outlook. Facts have proved that the Party's general line for socialist construction is completely correct and has great vitality. Under the principle of "taking steel as the key link" and "overall leap forward," the steel front last year fulfilled and overfulfilled the great call of "doubling steel production" put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao ahead of schedule, both refining steel and people, and achieved unprecedented achievements in the completion of steel tasks and the improvement of workers' ideological consciousness. The attainment of these great achievements is the result of your—the workers on the steel front— soaring enthusiasm and hard work under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

This year is a decisive year in our country's three years of hard work, and it is also a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of last year's victory. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward new and grand plans, requiring the production of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton this year. Completing and over-completing these four major indicators and other indicators is a common task for the whole Party and the whole people. In this overall task, the national steel workers shoulder a very glorious and great task. Eighteen million tons of steel is a key link, and its successful completion is of particularly great significance for promoting national socialist construction, promoting national industrialization, promoting agricultural mechanization, and realizing this year's entire national economic plan.

Eighteen million tons of steel is a very ambitious indicator, and it is an indicator that must be over-fulfilled. The tasks on the entire steel front, with this indicator as the key link, have the following characteristics: (1) The absolute increase in steel is greater than last year; (2) In addition to steel, the planned targets for major products such as iron ore, coke, refractory materials, pig iron, and steel products have almost doubled compared with last year; (3) The investment and scale of construction in basic construction are larger than in previous years, and the proportion of undertaking current production tasks is greater than in previous years. These characteristics show that this year's leap forward is greater and more comprehensive than last year, and at the same time, it shows that the tasks facing steel workers are very arduous. This task can only be completed by relying on the great strength of millions of steel worker comrades.

Can the task be completed? It is entirely possible to complete it. We have many favorable conditions to overcome all the difficulties on the road ahead. Under the strong leadership of the Party, and with the help of Soviet experts, comrades will further give play to their soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom. You have gained rich experience in running steel in a big way last year, your technology will improve day by day, and the national steel basic construction will increase day by day. These are the decisive factors to ensure the completion of this year's task. Every time we think of or see you in iron mines, in refractory material plants, next to coke ovens, next to blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, converters, electric furnaces, and next to rolling mills, engaging in the struggle of steel production with soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and constantly achieving victories, we are full of confidence in completing the great task of 18 million tons of steel!

For the greater leap forward in national industry and agriculture, the national production and basic construction departments are now waiting for you to produce more and better steel and steel products. Therefore, it is also necessary to require you to achieve high yield, high quality, and multiple varieties from now on, and continuously improve the daily production level of iron ore, coke, refractory materials, pig iron, steel, steel products, and other products, and strive for each equipment, each enterprise, and each day to comprehensively complete and over-complete the national plan, and ensure that the steel front achieves an all-round bumper harvest and all-round leap forward this year.

This requires you to give play to your soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of collectivism, and carry out a socialist red flag competition to improve output, quality, improve equipment utilization rate, improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and save raw materials. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is holding a high-yield and high-quality competition broadcast meeting here in accordance with the situation of the greater leap forward and the enthusiastic wishes of the vast number of steel workers, which I think is necessary.

To ensure the completion of the tasks on the steel front and to win the victory of the high-yield and high-quality competition, it is necessary to:

(1) Vigorously carry out mass movements. The task is so important and arduous that it can only be completed by relying on millions of steel workers. The Party's various undertakings tell us that the strength of the masses is endless, and it is the source of our overcoming difficulties and creating miracles. The practice of running steel in a big way last year proved that it is not possible to run industry coldly and quietly, and only a vigorous mass movement can promote the rapid development of productive forces. Why can the national blast furnace and open hearth furnace red flags fly for a long time on the buildings of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 3? This is not because the equipment there is advanced, but because the mass movement there is carried out more deeply and thoroughly. Therefore, every enterprise must strengthen the Party's leadership, implement political command, and use the method of mass movement to engage in production, conscientiously implement "two participations," "one reform," and "three combinations," hand the plan over to the masses for discussion, attach importance to the experience of veteran workers, attach importance to the enthusiasm and vigor of young workers, attach importance to the research and experiments of technicians, respect each other, unite with each other, and "everyone is of one heart, and the yellow soil turns into gold," so that we can victoriously complete the glorious and great task.

Leading cadres of various factories and mining enterprises must also catch up with the mass movement in the organization and management of production, and in specific measures, so as to combine centralized leadership and the promotion of democracy well.

(2) Vigorously engage in technical revolution. Since Chairman Mao put forward the idea of breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do last year, a vigorous technical revolution movement has been set off in the steel industry. Not only has it broken many old technical theories that have shackled productive forces, but it has also emerged with endless technical innovations and advanced experiences such as three-slot steel tapping in open hearth steelmaking, mixed steelmaking in electric furnace steelmaking, rapid firing of refractory materials, high smelting intensity ironmaking operations on blast furnaces, and multi-strip fast rolling advanced operation methods in steel rolling... and a team of thousands of technical innovators and inventors has emerged. This movement has a major revolutionary significance for improving production and improving quality. This year, we must continue to break superstitions, promote various effective advanced experiences, and continuously improve technology and master technology, and persist in the technical revolution. In this great movement, at the same time, I hope that every worker comrade will pay attention to equipment maintenance and repair, pay attention to production safety, pay attention to mastering operating procedures, and pay attention to continuously improving technology. Not only should we increase our efforts, but we should also be skillful, everyone should use their brains to think of ways, everyone should compete as Zhuge Liang, and everyone should show their heroism.

(3) Grasp both ends and bring along the middle. In the steel production sector, there is currently a contradiction of "large middle and small ends" (i.e., the capacity of ironmaking and steelmaking is greater than the production capacity of raw materials and steel rolling), and there are weak links such as transportation not keeping up with production needs.... This is not surprising. This is not because the capacity of raw materials, steel rolling, and transportation has been reduced, but because the needs of the great leap forward in steel have expanded rapidly. This is a contradiction in development, a tension in the leap forward, and a phenomenon that is bound to occur in the process of advancement. This requires greater efforts and more skillful work from the comrades in the mining sector, the coking sector, the refractory materials sector, the transportation sector, and the steel rolling sector. As long as we are good at breaking through weak links in a timely manner, we can promote a greater leap forward in the entire steel production and bring it to a new level. In order to ensure this year's task, we must currently grasp both ends and bring along the middle, concentrate our efforts to solve the weak links such as raw materials, steel rolling, and transportation, especially we must first grasp the construction and production work of raw materials (mines, coke, refractory materials).

(4) Walk on two legs. In the practice of the great leap forward last year, the Party summed up a complete set of guidelines for "simultaneous development of central industry and local industry, large enterprises and medium and small enterprises, and foreign production methods and indigenous production methods." This set of guidelines has played an extremely significant role in the high-speed development of the steel industry and must be resolutely implemented. It should be known that large-scale modern enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel are indeed the backbone and key points of my country's steel industry and have their significant role, but a larger number of medium and small enterprises play a decisive role in the growth rate and industrial layout of the steel industry. Taking ironmaking as an example, more than 50% of this year's tasks will be completed by thousands of small blast furnaces. If we ignore the status of medium and small enterprises, we will make mistakes.

(5) The whole country as one chessboard. This is the central government's guideline and must be conscientiously implemented. Without the communist style of subordinating the part to the whole, it is impossible to ensure that the whole country is one chessboard. Whether or not we can adhere to the whole country as one chessboard ideologically and actionally is a question of testing the strength of the Party spirit of every locality, every department, every enterprise, and every cadre. In order to ensure the completion of the entire steel task with 18 million tons of steel as the key link, we must be consistent across the country, give play to the spirit of high communist cooperation, support each other, and cooperate closely under the banner of "taking steel as the key link and overall leap forward." From the perspective of the steel sector, we must ensure the production of more and better steel and steel products, ensure the completion of the national allocation plan for steel, coke, and refractory materials, and supply the needs of various steel enterprises, and supply the needs of other fraternal departments. The workers in departments closely related to the steel sector, such as coal, railways, machinery..., should vigorously support and ensure the successful completion of 18 million tons of steel, and strengthen communist cooperation.

Comrades, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward upsurge is rising. The two fronts of national industrial and agricultural production and the basic front of the national economy are waiting for you to supply more good iron, good steel, and good steel products, and the people of the whole country are looking forward to your battle news of high-yield and high-quality competition!

Comrades, forge ahead bravely!

I wish you victory!

I wish the national plan with steel as the key link to be completed and over-completed ahead of schedule!

    掀起钢铁生产更大跃进的高潮
    李富春同志在全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会上的讲话
    在钢铁战线上奋勇作战的亲爱的同志们：
    今天，冶金工业部与中央人民广播电台联合举办一个“全国钢铁职工高产优质、全面丰收竞赛广播大会”。钢铁战线上的几百万大军，都参加了这个大会，要把自己为钢而战的雄心壮志告诉党和毛主席。我代表党中央和国务院，向你们致以最亲切的慰问，预祝这次广播大会成为更加鼓足干劲保证完成和超额完成今年钢铁任务的大会。
    大家知道，1958年是我国全民全面大跃进的一年。这一年，我们无论在生产关系的变革和生产力的发展方面，无论在物质基础的增长和精神面貌的改变方面，都获得了极其伟大的成绩和极为丰富的经验。事实证明了党的社会主义建设总路线是完全正确的，是具有伟大生命力的。在“以钢为纲”、“全面跃进”的方针下，钢铁战线上在去年提前、超额实现了党和毛主席提出的“钢产翻一番”的伟大号召，炼钢又炼人，在钢铁任务的完成上和职工们思想觉悟的提高上都取得了空前的成绩。这种种伟大成绩的取得，是你们——钢铁战线上的职工们，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，干劲冲天，努力奋斗的结果。
    今年，是我国苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年，也是在去年胜利的基础上，更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年。党的八届六中全会提出了新的宏伟的计划，要求在今年生产一千八百万吨钢、三亿八千万吨煤、一万零五百亿斤粮食和一亿担棉花。完成和超额完成这四大指标及其他指标，是全党全民共同的任务。在这个总任务中，全国钢铁职工担负着十分光荣而伟大的任务。一千八百万吨钢是一条纲，它的胜利完成，对促进全国社会主义建设、促进全国工业化、促进农业机械化以及实现今年整个国民经济计划有着特别重大的意义。
    一千八百万吨钢是一个十分宏伟的指标，是必须超额完成的指标。以这个指标为纲的整个钢铁战线上的任务，有着这样几个特点：（一）钢的绝对增长量比去年更大；（二）除了钢以外，铁矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、生铁、钢材等主要产品的计划指标，几乎都比去年有成倍地增长；（三）基本建设方面的投资和工程规模比历年都大，承担当年生产任务的比重比历年都重。这些特点，说明今年比去年跃进得更大、更全面，同时也说明摆在钢铁职工面前的任务是十分艰巨的。这个任务只有依靠成百万的钢铁职工同志们的伟大力量来完成。
    任务能否完成呢？是完全能够完成的。我们有很多有利条件去战胜前进道路上的一切困难。在党的坚强领导下，并有苏联专家的帮助，同志们将进一步发挥冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧，在去年大办钢铁时取得了丰富的经验，你们的技术将一天一天进步，全国的钢铁基本建设将一天一天增加，这些都是保证今年完成任务的决定性因素。每当我们想到或看到你们在铁矿山中，在耐火材料厂中，在炼焦炉旁，在高炉、平炉、转炉、电炉旁，在轧钢机旁，以冲天的干劲，以苦干、实干、巧干精神，进行钢铁生产斗争而不断取得胜利的时候，我们就充满着完成一千八百万吨钢这个伟大任务的信心！
    为了全国工农业的更大跃进，现在全国的生产和基本建设部门，都在等待着你们生产出更多、更好的钢铁和钢材。因此，还必需要求你们从现在起，做到高产、优质、多品种，不断提高铁矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、生铁、钢、钢材以及其他产品的日产水平，力争每一个设备、每一个企业、每一天都全面完成和超额完成国家计划，保证今年在钢铁战线上达到全面大丰收，全面大跃进。
    这就需要你们以集体主义的精神发挥冲天的干劲，开展一个提高产量、质量，提高设备利用系数，提高劳动生产率，降低成本、节约原材料的社会主义红旗大竞赛。冶金工业部根据更大跃进的形势及广大钢铁职工的热烈愿望，在这里召开高产优质竞赛广播大会，我认为是必要的。
    要保证钢铁战线任务的完成，要取得高产优质竞赛的胜利，必须做到：
      （一）要大搞群众运动。任务如此重大而艰巨，只有依靠几百万钢铁职工，才能完成。党的各种事业告诉我们：群众的力量是无穷无尽的，它是我们克服困难和创造奇迹的源泉。去年大办钢铁运动的实践证明：冷冷清清办工业是不行的，只有轰轰烈烈的群众运动才能促进生产力的迅速发展。为什么全国高炉和平炉红旗能够长期在本溪第一铁厂和上钢一厂、三厂的房子上飘扬呢？这并不是那里的设备先进，而是那里的群众运动进行得比较深、比较透。因此，每一个企业都必须加强党的领导、实行政治挂帅，以群众运动的方法来搞生产，认真实行“两参”“一改”“三结合”，要把计划交给群众讨论，要重视老工人的经验，重视青年工人的干劲和朝气，重视技术人员的研究试验，相互尊重，相互团结，“大家一条心，黄土变成金”，这样我们就能够胜利地完成光荣伟大的任务。
    各厂矿企业的领导干部，还必须把生产的组织管理工作，把具体措施赶上群众运动，使集中领导和发扬民主好好结合起来。
      （二）大闹技术革命。去年，毛主席提出打破迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格以来，在钢铁工业中兴起了一个蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命运动。不仅打破了许多束缚生产力的陈旧技术理论，而且出现了像平炉炼钢的三槽出钢、电炉炼钢的混合炼钢、耐火材料快速烧成、高炉上的高冶炼强度的炼铁操作、轧钢上的多条快轧的先进操作方法……等等层出不穷的技术革新和先进经验，涌现了成千上万的技术革新者和创造发明家队伍。这个运动，对提高生产、提高质量具有重大的革命意义。我们今年必须继续破除迷信，推广各种行之有效的先进经验，不断提高技术和掌握技术，把技术革命坚持下去。在这个伟大运动中，同时希望每一个职工同志要注意设备维护检修、注意生产的安全、注意掌握操作规程、注意不断提高技术。不但要劲上加劲，而且要巧上加巧，大家动脑筋想办法，人人赛诸葛，个个逞英豪。
      （三）抓两头，带中间。在钢铁生产部门，目前存在着“中间大，两头小”（即炼铁、炼钢能力大于原料及轧钢生产能力）的矛盾，并出现了运输跟不上生产需要……等薄弱环节。这是不足为怪的。因为这并不是由于原料、轧钢、运输的能力缩减了，而是钢铁大跃进对它们的需要迅速扩大了。这是发展中的矛盾，跃进中的紧张，是前进过程中必然产生的现象，这就特别需要矿山部门、炼焦部门、耐火材料部门、运输部门、轧钢部门的职工同志们更大的努力，更多的巧干。只要我们善于及时突破薄弱环节，就能推动整个钢铁生产的更大跃进，使它达到新的水平。为了确保今年任务，当前我们必须抓两头、带中间，集中力量解决原料、轧钢、运输等薄弱环节，特别是首先要抓紧原料（矿山、焦炭、耐火材料）的建设和生产工作。
      （四）用两条腿走路。去年大跃进的实践中，党总结了“中央工业与地方工业，大型企业与中、小型企业，洋法生产与土法生产同时并举”一整套用两条腿走路的方针。这套方针，在钢铁工业高速度发展的过程中，产生了极为巨大的作用，必须继续坚决贯彻执行。要知道，像鞍钢、武钢、包钢这种大型现代化企业，固然是我国钢铁工业中的骨干和重点，有其重大的作用，但是数量更多的中、小型企业，在钢铁工业的增长速度和工业布局方面，却起着决定性的作用。以炼铁为例，今年的任务就有50％以上将靠数以千计的小高炉来完成。如果我们忽视了中、小型企业的地位，我们就会犯错误。
      （五）全国一盘棋。这是中央的方针，必须认真地执行。如果没有局部服从整体的共产主义风格，要保证全国一盘棋是不可能的。能否从思想上、行动上坚持全国一盘棋，是考验每一个地方、每一个部门、每一个企业、每一个干部党性强弱的问题。为了保证一千八百万吨钢为纲的整个钢铁任务的完成，我们必须全国一致，在“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的旗帜下，发挥高度共产主义协作精神，互相支援，通力合作。从钢铁部门来说，必须保证生产出更多、更好的钢铁、钢材，保证完成全国钢铁、焦炭及耐火材料的调拨计划，供应各个钢铁企业的需要，供应其他兄弟部门的需要。与钢铁部门有密切关系的部门，如煤炭、铁道、机械……等部门的职工，则应该大力支援和保证一千八百万吨钢的胜利完成，加强共产主义的协作。
    同志们，一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进高潮正在兴起。全国工农业生产的两个战线上，国民经济基本战线上，正等待着你们供应更多的好铁、好钢、好钢材，全国人民正期待着你们高产优质竞赛的战斗捷报！
    同志们，奋勇前进吧！
    祝你们胜利！
    祝以钢为纲的全国计划提前完成和超额完成！
