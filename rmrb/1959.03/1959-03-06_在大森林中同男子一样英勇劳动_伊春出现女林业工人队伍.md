Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: A forestry worker team composed of 30,000 women has emerged in China's famous Yichun forest area.

　　These 30,000 female forestry workers are mostly family members of forestry workers. After being liberated from housework last year, they have been bravely laboring alongside men in all aspects of forestry production. One can see female switchyard operators skillfully swinging signals at railway stations where timber is gathered and dispatched. After timber cars stop, the female conductors, female drivers, and female stokers jump down from the train. When the train is about to depart, female switch operators approach the track switches. In timber processing plants, many workers, whether sawing lumber or manufacturing fiberboard, are women. In nurseries, groups of women are carefully building seedbeds, loosening soil, applying fertilizer, and watering. At the entrances of new villages bordering the forests, and along the roads in the dense forests, female forest protection and fire prevention patrol teams are protecting the forests. Female log haulers are shouting at the ox and horse teams, transporting the harvested timber down the mountains. On every forestry farm, one can see female loggers, female scalers, and female technicians working diligently. After these 30,000 women joined production, they increased Yichun's forest industry workforce by 20%, alleviating the difficulty of insufficient labor in forestry production.

    在大森林中同男子一样英勇劳动
    伊春出现女林业工人队伍
    新华社哈尔滨4日电　我国著名的伊春林区出现了一支由三万名妇女组成的林业工人队伍。
    这三万名女林业工人大都是林业职工的家属。她们去年从家务中解放出来后，就在林业生产的各个环节上同男子们一起英勇地劳动。人们可以在集散木材的火车站上看到女调车员熟练地摆动着信号，木材车停下来后，从车上跑下来的是女车长、女司机、女司炉。当火车要开动的时候，走近搬道器的是女搬道员。在木材加工厂里，不论锯木工人还是制造纤维板的工人，都有许多是妇女。在苗圃里，一群群的妇女在细心地叠苗池、松土、施肥、浇水。在森林边的新村村口、在密林的路旁，妇女护林防火巡查队在保护着森林。女集材工在吆喝着牛马套子，把采伐好的木材运下山来。在每一个林场上，都能看到女伐木工、女检尺员和女技术员在辛勤地劳动。这三万名妇女参加生产后，为伊春的森林工业增加了20％的劳动力，缓和了林业生产上劳动力不足的困难。
