    Three-Wheat Technical Research Network Spreads Across Fields
    Yangzhong County Trains Technicians at All Levels, Striving for a Yield of 1,000 Jin Per Mu
    (Our newspaper Nanjing, 5th dispatch) Jiangsu's Yangzhong County has established a three-wheat thousand-jin technical research network, cultivating and training a technical backbone force, launching a mass thousand-jin technical research movement, and strengthening the scientific management of wheat fields, striving for large-scale, high-yield production.
    Due to new circumstances of deep plowing and close planting, field management requires more meticulous and scientific methods than in the past. In order to strive for high yields in every plot and a bumper harvest per mu, the Yangzhong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to strengthen technical guidance by organizing a three-wheat thousand-jin technical research network. Recently, the county, communes, and production brigades have universally established thousand-jin schools, and production teams have universally established thousand-jin research groups, generally with one thousand-jin technician for every ten to fifteen mu of land. Currently, the county has established more than 80 thousand-jin schools, more than 600 thousand-jin research groups, and more than 9,000 technical backbone personnel, forming a powerful technical force. This thousand-jin technical research organization and personnel are as dense as a spiderweb, distributed throughout the county.
    Party committees at all levels in Yangzhong County have universally strengthened their leadership over the thousand-jin technical research network. Each thousand-jin school generally has a secretary serving as the principal, and teachers are technical personnel with rich agricultural knowledge and experienced farmers. The thousand-jin schools are generally part-time, with the county mainly training commune and brigade cadres and county-level officials who frequently go to the countryside. Communes and brigades mainly train Party and Communist Youth League members, experienced farmers, and some young activists. In terms of teaching content and methods, they tightly grasp every "checkpoint" in the wheat seedling growth process, teaching management techniques. They adopt the method of organizing students to go to the fields to "look, talk, and drill," learning, researching, setting examples, and promoting advanced operational techniques. Thousand-jin research groups are generally composed of production team leaders, labor models, and young people with technical knowledge. Their task is to research and process management technical measures based on the growth patterns of wheat seedlings. The thousand-jin technicians who manage the fields mainly guide the masses to strictly implement technical operating procedures, and use methods such as working and discussing research at the same time to specifically assist members in learning and mastering new management techniques. The county's Agricultural Science Research Institute and the agricultural science research groups of various communes are responsible for the business guidance of the thousand-jin technical research network.
    After Yangzhong County established the thousand-jin technical research network, it universally improved the scientific and technical level of cadres and the masses, and strengthened the scientific management of large-area crops. When wheat seedlings were passing the greening stage, the thousand-jin schools and thousand-jin research groups in various places universally organized members to study and discuss, so that they knew what should be done at this "checkpoint" and how to do it. Therefore, the entire county passed the greening stage relatively well, and the wheat seedlings generally grew well. When the eighth production team of the Qingfeng Brigade of the Baqiao Commune applied fertilizer, because the seedlings were dense and tender, they made pig ash, smoked soil and other fertilizers fine, and then sifted them like flour, sprinkling them into the field by hand. The thousand-jin technician who managed the fields specifically guided the masses to implement this technical measure, so the fertilizer was applied very evenly. When the thousand-jin research group of the third production team of the Tongxin Brigade of the Happiness Commune studied yield-increasing measures, they proposed a plan to apply different fertilizers according to the different growth conditions of wheat seedlings. The production team then adopted the method of applying more pig ash, soil fertilizer, and a small amount of nitrogen fertilizer to first-class wheat fields, and applying more nitrogen fertilizer (human manure) to third-class wheat fields, so that the more than 170 mu of wheat seedlings in the entire team developed in a balanced manner.
    Currently, the Yangzhong County Party Committee is training a group of technical backbones for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests from top to bottom, and before the wheat harvest, it will also train a group of technical backbones for seed selection and seed retention.

    三麦技术研究网遍布田间
    扬中县层层培训技术员力争亩亩产千斤
    本报南京5日电　江苏扬中县建立三麦千斤技术研究网，培养和训练技术骨干队伍，开展群众性的千斤技术研究运动，加强了麦田的科学管理，力争大面积高额丰产。
    由于深翻、密植的新情况，田间管理要求比过去更加细致、更加科学。为了力争块块高产、亩亩丰收，中共扬中县委决定用组织三麦千斤技术研究网的办法，加强技术指导。最近，县和各公社、生产大队都普遍举办了千斤学校，生产队都普遍成立了千斤研究小组，一般每十到十五亩田都有一名千斤技术员。目前，全县已办起千斤学校八十多个，千斤研究小组六百多个，千斤技术骨干九千多人，组成了一支强大的技术队伍。这个千斤技术研究组织和人员密如蛛网，分布在全县各地。
    扬中县各级党委普遍加强了对千斤技术研究网的领导，每个千斤学校一般都有一名书记担任校长，教员由有丰富农业知识的技术人员和老农担任。千斤学校都是业余性质的，县里主要培养训练社队干部和县级机关经常下乡的工作人员，公社和大队主要训练党、团员老农和一部分青年积极分子。在教学内容和教学方法上，紧紧抓住麦苗生长过程中的每个“关口”，讲授管理技术。采取组织学员到田头“看、谈、钻”的方法，边学习，边研究，做出样子，推广先进的操作技术。千斤研究小组一般都由生产队长、劳动模范和有技术知识的青年组成，他们的任务是根据麦苗生长规律研究加工管理的技术措施。管理到田的千斤技术员，主要是指导群众严格贯彻技术操作规程，并运用一面干活、一面讨论研究等方法，具体辅导社员学习和掌握新的管理技术。县里的农业科学研究所和各公社的农业科学研究小组，负责千斤技术研究网的业务指导。
    扬中县建立起千斤技术研究网以后，普遍提高了干部群众的科学技术水平，加强了大面积作物的科学管理。在麦苗过返青关时，各地的千斤学校和千斤研究小组，普遍组织社员学习讨论，使他们知道在这个“关口”上应当干些什么？怎样干？因此，全县的返青关都过的较好，麦苗普遍生长良好。八桥公社庆丰大队第八生产队在施肥时，因为苗密、苗嫩，都把猪灰、熏土等肥料搞细，再用筛子落的像面粉一样，用手撒到田里。管理到田的千斤技术员具体指导群众贯彻了这项技术措施，因而肥料施的很匀。幸福公社同新大队第三生产队千斤研究小组在研究增产措施时，提出了根据不同麦苗的生长情况，追施不同肥料的方案，生产队便采取一类麦田多施猪灰、土化肥和少量氮肥，三类麦田多施氮肥（人粪尿），使全队一百七十多亩麦苗平衡发展。
    目前，扬中县委正在自上而下培养训练一批防治病虫害的技术骨干，麦收前还将训练一批选种、留种的技术骨干。　（姜韦才）（附图片）
