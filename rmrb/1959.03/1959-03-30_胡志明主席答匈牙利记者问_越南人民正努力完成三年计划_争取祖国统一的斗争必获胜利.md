Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 27th: The Hungarian "People's Freedom" newspaper published on the 27th the answers given by President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to questions raised by reporters from "People's Freedom" and the Hungarian News Agency.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the situation in Asia has undergone tremendous changes in the past decade. Ten years ago, Chiang Kai-shek was still entrenched in mainland China, but now, the vast majority of Asian people are living independent lives; China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are building socialism; India, Indonesia, and Burma are also striving to establish their own national economies.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the imperialists are unhappy about this, and they are attempting to occupy and have already occupied Taiwan, South Korea, and South Vietnam, as well as other places. The imperialists are mobilizing countries in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to oppose the Asian people, but ultimate victory will surely belong to the people. The declaration issued by the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve countries in Moscow in 1957 clearly analyzed this and correctly believed that not only the people of Asia and Africa but also the people of Latin America are advancing along the path of independence and progress in an unstoppable manner. The work and struggle of the Vietnamese people are part of the great anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then said that the Vietnamese comrades learned a lot from the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The 21st Congress opened up the road to building communism, and the Soviet Union's seven-year plan greatly encouraged the fraternal countries, the working class, and the broad working people in capitalist countries.

When talking about the current tasks of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that we must strive to complete the three-year plan and improve the people's living standards. In this regard, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have given us great assistance, and we must complete the task of socialist construction more quickly.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that industrialization is developing rapidly in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. By 1960, agricultural collectivization will be 60%-70% complete. In terms of literacy work, great achievements have been made. In the past, 95% of the Vietnamese people were illiterate, but now only 5% of the people are illiterate.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh finally pointed out that the biggest problem for the Vietnamese people is to strive for national reunification. We are confident that the country will be reunified. To achieve this, we will naturally have to overcome many difficulties, but the people will surely win, and the country will surely be reunified.

    胡志明主席答匈牙利记者问
    越南人民正努力完成三年计划
    争取祖国统一的斗争必获胜利
    新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”27日刊登了越南民主共和国主席胡志明对“人民自由报”和匈牙利通讯社记者提出的问题的答复。
    胡志明主席指出，最近十年以来亚洲的局势发生了巨大的变化。十年前，蒋介石还盘踞在中国大陆，但是现在，绝大多数的亚洲人民过着独立的生活；中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国正在建设着社会主义；印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸也在为建立自己的民族经济而努力。
    胡志明主席说，帝国主义对这一点是不高兴的，他们企图侵占而且已经侵占了台湾、南朝鲜和南越以及其它地方。帝国主义者发动东南亚条约组织中的国家来反对亚洲人民，但是，最后胜利必然是属于人民的。十二个国家的共产党和工人党1957年在莫斯科发表的宣言很清楚地分析了这一点，而且十分正确地认为，不仅亚洲和非洲人民，就是拉丁美洲人民也在不可阻挡地沿着独立和进步的道路前进。越南人民的工作和斗争是反帝国主义、反殖民主义伟大斗争的一部分。
    胡志明主席接着说，越南同志们从苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会学习了很多东西。二十一次代表大会开辟了建设共产主义的道路，苏联的七年计划大大鼓舞了兄弟国家和资本主义国家的工人阶级和广大劳动人民。
    胡志明主席在谈到越南人民目前的任务时说，我们要努力完成三年计划，提高人民生活水平。在这方面，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家给了我们很大的援助，我们要更快地完成社会主义建设任务。
    胡志明主席说，工业化在越南民主共和国迅速发展着。到1960年，农业合作化将完成60％—70％。在扫盲工作方面，已经取得了很大成绩，过去越南人民95％是文盲，现在只有5％的人不识字。
    胡志明主席最后指出，越南人民最大的问题是争取国家的统一。我们确信，国家会统一起来的，要实现这一点，自然要克服很多困难，但是，人民一定会胜利，国家一定会统一。
