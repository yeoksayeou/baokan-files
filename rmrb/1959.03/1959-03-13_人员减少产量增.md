    Reduced Workforce, Increased Production
    Cheng Xihai, Secretary of the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee

    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Anhui Provincial Committee, Huainan City has actively implemented the policy of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward." In 1958, the city's total industrial output value exceeded the plan by 121%, an increase of 83% compared to 1957, exceeding the total output value from 1952 to 1955.

    Last year, the city added 130,000 new workers. This year, Huainan City's total industrial output value will increase by 1.13 times compared to last year. Many enterprises have put forward new labor force utilization plans based on their production tasks, and the city still needs to add more than 150,000 people. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, the Municipal Committee has carefully studied the labor force utilization situation in the city and believes that there is great potential in various factories and mines, especially in coal, coking, and steel enterprises. As long as the potential is seriously tapped, the requirements of doubling the task and reducing personnel can be fully achieved. Therefore, the Municipal Committee decided to resolutely carry out a mass movement to rectify labor organization in the city's factories and mines.

    After accounting and tapping potential, this year, not only is it unnecessary to add 150,000 new employees, but 61,058 people can also be transferred from the existing personnel, while the production efficiency of various enterprises can be generally increased by 30% to 200%. Of the streamlined personnel, 15,000 will be retained to supplement the city's newly built or expanded enterprises, and the remaining personnel can be transferred to other regions to support industrial and agricultural production.

    We have been able to achieve greater results in a short period of time for the following reasons.

    1.  The whole Party takes action, and politics takes command. Vigorously mobilize the masses and actively carry out rectification. In the beginning, all units conducted investigations to ascertain the facts; then, Party members, cadres, and all employees meetings were generally held to conduct repeated education. Through the education on rectifying labor organization, the erroneous ideas of some leading cadres that "increasing production must increase people" and "more people can handle things better" and that they did not consider costs or efficiency were basically reversed. Because the ideological education of employees was relatively thorough and meticulous, the movement started on January 20th, reached its climax on the 25th, and achieved complete success by the end of the month. The methods adopted in this movement were mainly the combination of airing views freely, big-character posters, group meetings, and exposure and debate. More than 180,000 big-character posters were posted during the movement, and the masses put forward more than 210,000 opinions, with more than 95% of the employees actively participating in the movement. Some coal mine workers were very dissatisfied with the insufficient workload and wrote big-character posters in the form of quick rhythm verses, and some units' workers criticized the lax discipline. After airing views freely, the employees' awareness was significantly improved, and labor discipline was greatly strengthened. On the basis of airing views freely, the method of combining leadership and the masses was adopted to formulate quota plans. In order to ensure that the formulation of the plan is based on advanced reliability, it was particularly emphasized that to grasp reasonable advanced quotas, it must be (1) Ensure safe production; (2) Do not increase the labor intensity of workers; (3) Start from a long-term perspective and be sustainable to prevent possible deviations in the formulation and implementation of the plan. At the same time, the formulation of the plan must be combined with technological reforms and tool reforms, and these factors must be considered in the plan. Because this issue was emphasized, most of the plans were formulated in a relatively advanced and reasonable manner.

    2.  Mobilize the masses to carry out technological revolution and tool reforms on a large scale. While solving ideological problems, the important significance of technological revolution was particularly emphasized, and this link was closely grasped throughout the entire movement. Therefore, the goals of greatly reducing personnel, rapidly increasing production efficiency, and reducing labor intensity were achieved. For example, after the successful self-manufacture of a brick-making machine by the coking plant of Xie No. 3 Mine, 34 bricks could be produced per minute, and 40,000 bricks could be produced per day. As a result, the labor of 39 people replaced the heavy operation of 324 people. The Xie No. 1 Mine coking plant used electric coal screening instead of manual coal screening, which saved 88 labor forces. The 702 construction zone of the coal washing plant construction company successfully trial-produced a ramming machine, which increased labor efficiency by eight to ten times.

    3.  Adjust labor combinations and streamline auxiliary personnel. For example, the transportation area of Jiulonggang Coal Mine reduced personnel by more than 200 by merging the original 19 groups into 12 groups. When determining the blast furnace quotas in various steel plants, the method of concurrent operations was adopted for hot air, blast workers, and weighers, and the personnel were reduced by half. In the past, the ratio of production workers to auxiliary workers was very unreasonable. For example, in the coal mine system, auxiliary workers accounted for 55%, and in steel enterprises, auxiliary production personnel exceeded more than twice the number of direct production workers. After mobilizing the masses to discuss, compress, and adjust, this situation was changed, which played a significant role in improving labor productivity.

    After rectifying the labor organization, the awareness of the broad masses of employees in Huainan City has been further improved. At present, they are striving to overfulfill the production plan in every possible way with soaring revolutionary vigor.

    人员减少产量增
    中共淮南市委书记　程西海
    淮南市在党中央和安徽省委的正确领导下，积极贯彻“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针，1958年全年工业总产值超额完成121％，比1957年增长83％，超过了1952年到1955年总产值的总和。
    去年，全市共增加了新工人十三万人。今年淮南市工业总产值，将比去年增加一点一三倍。不少企业单位根据生产任务分别提出了新的劳动力使用计划，全市还需增加十五万多人。市委根据省委的指示，认真研究了全市劳动力的使用情况，认为各厂矿企业尤其是煤炭、炼焦、钢铁企业中的潜力很大，只要认真挖掘潜力，完全可以达到任务加翻、人员减少的要求。因此市委决定：坚决在全市厂矿企业内进行一次整顿劳动组织的群众运动。
    经过算账和挖掘潜力，今年不但不需要增加十五万新职工，而且还可以从现有人员中抽调出六万一千零五十八人，而各企业的生产效率将可普遍提高30％到200％。精简下来的人员除留一万五千人补充本市新建或扩建企业外，其余人员可调给其他地区，支援工农业生产。
    我们能在短期内取得较大成绩，有以下几个原因。
    一、全党动手、政治挂帅。大力发动群众，积极进行整改。开始，各单位都进行了调查摸底工作；接着又普遍地召开党团员、干部会和全体职工会议，反复进行教育。通过整顿劳动组织的教育，基本上扭转了某些领导干部“增产必增人”、“人多好办事”和不计成本不算效率的错误思想。由于对职工思想教育比较深入细致，所以运动从1月20日开始，到25日就达到高潮，到月底就取得了圆满成效。这次运动所采取的方法，主要是大鸣大放、大字报、小组会、揭发辩论结合进行。运动中共贴出大字报十八万多张，群众提出的意见有二十一万多条，有95％以上的职工积极参加了运动。有的煤矿工人对本身工作量不足非常不满意，编成快板写出大字报，有的单位的工人对纪律松懈的现象提出了批评。经过大鸣大放、职工觉悟有了显著提高，劳动纪律大大加强。在大鸣大放的基础上，采取了领导与群众相结合，制订了定员定额方案。为了使方案的制定建立在先进可靠的基础上，特别强调了要抓合理先进的定员定额，必须作到（1）确保安全生产；（2）不增加工人的劳动强度；（3）要从长远出发，持久可行，以防止在制订方案中和实现方案后可能发生的偏差。同时，制订方案必须与技术改革、工具改革结合起来，把这方面的因素考虑到方案中去。由于强调了这一问题，所以大部分方案制订得比较先进合理。
    二、发动群众大搞技术革命和工具改革。在解决思想问题的同时，就特别强调技术革命的重要意义，以后在整个运动中也都紧紧抓住这一环节。因此达到人员大大减少，生产效率迅速提高，劳动强度减轻的目的。如谢三矿炼焦厂自制制砖机成功以后，每分钟可出砖三十四块，每天能出四万块，结果以三十九人的劳动代替了三百二十四人的笨重操作，谢一矿焦厂用电动筛煤代替人工筛煤，可节约出八十八个劳动力，选煤厂建筑公司702工区试制打夯机成功，劳动效率提高八到十倍。
    三、调整劳动组合，精简辅助人员。如九龙岗煤矿运输区把原来的十九个组合并为十二个组，就减少人员二百多名。各钢铁厂确定高炉定员时，对热风、鼓风工和司磅员都采取兼职作业的办法，人员便减少一半。在过去，生产工人和辅助工人的比例很不合理，如煤矿系统辅助工人占55％，钢铁企业中的辅助生产人员超过直接生产工人二倍以上。经过发动群众讨论和压缩调整，改变了这种情况，这对提高劳动生产率起着重大作用。
    经过整顿劳动组织，淮南市广大职工的觉悟有了进一步提高，目前，正以冲天的革命干劲，千方百计地为超额完成生产计划而努力。
