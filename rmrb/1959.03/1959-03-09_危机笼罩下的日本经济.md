The prosperity known as the "Jimmu Boom" (from 1955 to the spring of 1957) shifted into a crisis situation from the spring of 1957. Judging from the sharp decline in the industrial and mining production index, this crisis has the nature of being a link in the formation of a world cyclical crisis of overproduction, or the prelude to such a crisis.

With 1953 as 100, Japan's industrial and mining production index in May 1958 fell to 92.8% of May 1957, a sharp decrease of 30.8 compared to the ratio of May 1957 to May 1956. The reasons for the particularly low economic situation in Japan among all capitalist countries are: first, the post-war Japanese economy lost its imperialist colonial markets, and the enthusiastic equipment renewal from 1955 to 1957 had a backlash; second, the US imperialism, which controls the lifeline of the Japanese economy (especially in terms of raw materials and markets), is shifting the crisis to Japan, etc.

Since last autumn, the Japanese government, in coordination with the US authorities, has begun publishing statistical data on the "recovery" of the Japanese economy. According to the Economic Planning Agency (with 1955 as 100), the industrial and mining production index, which began to decline since April 1957, fell to its lowest point in April 1958 (139.75), and then rose to 149.1 in November of the same year. However, the highest index in October last year did not exceed the highest point of the "Jimmu Boom." If the index in 1956 increased by 22.4% compared to 1955, then 1958, compared to 1957, showed a negative number for the first time after the war. Moreover, industries such as coal and fertilizers are still increasing production despite the increase in unsold inventory. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about calling the situation of stopping the reduction and decline in production a "recovery." However, considering some other indices, the above-mentioned data released by the Nobusuke Kishi government can be regarded as a "recovery" in a certain sense. For example, the inventory index was 120 at the beginning of last year, fell to 110 in the summer, and further to 105 in October; also, wholesale prices showed a halt to the decline in November last year for the first time in thirteen months, etc.

The Nobusuke Kishi government and some monopoly capitalists, echoing the US authorities, are exaggerating this "recovery." The "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations," an organization of monopoly capitalists, regards this recovery as the prelude to a "large-scale rise," and promotes it as "demonstrating the outstanding superiority of modern capitalism." The Economic Planning Agency also said that the "economic recession" of about a year and a half has ended, and the new year will be "a year of economic recovery," encouraging them. Recently, the opinions of commercial newspapers have also been influenced by this.

Up to now, there have been two claims promoting the "improvement" of the Japanese economy. The first time was during the general election in May 1958. At that time, the reactionary forces promoted "improvement" on the grounds that the foreign exchange crisis had been eliminated, and the prices of stocks, textiles, and steel had rebounded somewhat. The rebound in the prices of textiles and steel, which occupied the main position, was a temporary result achieved by taking measures such as providing loans for unsold goods, establishing purchasing agencies, reducing operating rates, and implementing cartels, at the expense of the interests of the working people and small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, this phenomenon had already disappeared with the decline in wholesale prices. The first claim of "improvement" was thus overturned by the facts.

The second claim of "improvement" was "centered on financial figures returning to Tokyo from the United States" (November 8, 1958, "Tokyo Shimbun"), which began to spread from last autumn. The reasons they cited for the "recovery" were: first, exports increased, peaking in October last year; second, the situation of reducing operating rates has eased. In addition to these main factors, they also cited the following reasons: the speed of implementing plans to increase new industrial sectors such as synthetic fibers has accelerated, and the international prices of steel, copper, and oil have risen.

The problem is: first, this "recovery" has anti-people and anti-national content; second, the "recovery" is a temporary phenomenon, and it can even be said to have aggravated the degree of overproduction.

                (II)

From the perspective of people's lives, the most serious situation is that this "recovery" is the result of implementing measures such as "rationalization" and reducing operating rates, which means that workers and other people have suffered losses.

As of June 1958, monopoly capital groups reduced operating rates by an average of 30% in half of the industrial sectors to maintain monopoly prices. At the same time, in order to win in the fierce domestic and foreign market competition, they are using "rationalization investment" to reduce costs. As a result, first of all, corporate restructuring and unemployment are increasing. Moreover, it must be noted that the government's statistics on "completely unemployed people" (referring to people who have not done even one hour of work in the week of the survey) are becoming a regular phenomenon.

Last year, financial capital laid off a large number of workers in the textile, paper, pulp, shipping, chemical and other industrial sectors, and reorganized large companies such as "Nissan Chemical Industries Co., Ltd." (producing ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, with 6,574 employees), "Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd." (producing film, with 3,672 employees), "Japan Hydrogen Industry Co., Ltd." and "Japan Insulation Materials Co., Ltd." as "key companies," reducing some formal workers. Shipbuilding companies, small and medium-sized coal mines, etc. also laid off indirectly employed workers and temporary workers. Steel companies and "Nippon Express Co., Ltd." also implemented the method of transferring workers' jobs. Companies related to "special procurement" orders laid off an average of 4,000 workers per month. In small and medium-sized enterprises, for example, in the Sennan area (Osaka Prefecture), the weaving industry alone laid off 5,000 people. Layoffs in the coal mining industry have been postponed to this year.

In public enterprises, the state-owned railway (with 367,000 union members) implemented the first "rationalization" and laid off workers. Electrical communication enterprises (with 161,000 members) implemented the second "rationalization" and laid off workers. Postal and monopoly companies are also carrying out mechanization in production and administration.

While gradually changing semi-feudal labor conditions, large enterprises are also combining this practice with gradually adopting the American-style labor management system (implementing performance appraisal, compiling evaluation tables, promoting suggestion systems, and using company internal communications for internal management, etc.), requiring workers to work under extremely tense conditions in the concentrated automatic machinery system. While implementing layoffs, job transfers, and three-shift systems, they are also adopting methods such as lowering the rank of skilled workers, simplifying operating procedures, and hiring part-time staff to strengthen the capitalists' autocratic rule over workers. Moreover, "rationalization" measures have also been extended to small and medium-sized enterprises that belong to large enterprise systems. Monopoly capital organizations are increasingly deepening the dependence of small and medium-sized capitalists on monopoly capital organizations, requiring them to lower subcontracting prices and improve the precision of components. In the end, this loss is passed on to the workers.

The number of unemployed and underemployed people in Japan, which cannot be seen in official statistics, is said to account for one-sixth of the population. Monopoly capital uses the army of unemployed as a pressure to forcibly implement job grade wage systems in large enterprises, work efficiency wage systems in small and medium-sized enterprises, and minimum wage systems in scattered enterprises, and to suppress the grade of women's labor and the labor of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, last year, large textile companies such as "Kanebo Spinning Co., Ltd." reduced wages by 10%. The state-owned railway is also preparing to revise the wage system again from July this year. According to a survey by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the rate of wage increases due to the spring struggle, according to the Japan Council of Public Corporation Workers' Unions, was 6.2% in 1957 and dropped to 1% in 1958; according to the unions of eight large companies in the Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union system, it was 10.9% in 1957 and dropped to 6% in 1958. Generally speaking, the wage increase rate has decreased by about 30%. In contrast, excluding banks, the profit rate of 456 companies that regularly appear in the stock market decreased by only 20% when settling accounts in July 1958 (according to a survey by "Toyo Keizai Shinposha").

The methods forcibly implemented by monopoly capital to overcome this crisis are: using second unions (capitalists' puppet unions - editor's note) to split the labor movement; illegally punishing workers; and using the military and police to implement suppression.

A particularly noteworthy new phenomenon is that the decline of silkworm farmers and dairy farmers and the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises are emerging one after another. Not only that, even large industrial capitals such as "Nissan Chemical Industries Co., Ltd." and "Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd." have implemented subordinate reorganizations, and the capital concentration of financial capital is progressing. Moreover, due to the increase in the number of loans from the World Bank, agreements on foreign debt, and dependent relationships in foreign trade, the Japanese economy will further strengthen its subordination to US imperialism. The reason for this is mainly because the Nobusuke Kishi government wants to increasingly tighten the transformation of Japan into a link in the US strategic system, aiming at nuclear armament, reorganizing the entire Japanese economy according to the dependent military system, in order to stimulate the expansion of production according to this policy. Therefore, in fiscal year 1958, the Nobusuke Kishi government used a loan of 315 million US dollars and increased fiscal expenditure by 110.9 billion yen, combining the expansion of basic industries with the revival of militarism, stimulating the consumption of raw materials. For example, the manufacture of weapons such as missiles, jet aircraft, and warships, and the development of the electronics industry, have officially begun.

              (III)

However, the Economic Planning Agency itself cannot but admit that the "recovery" since the second half of last year was only caused by some temporary and artificial reasons. Temporary reasons are: seasonal increases in domestic demand; early start of public works projects; boom in export trade caused by lowering export prices; increased procurement of goods and raw materials after inventory reduction to a certain extent. Artificial reasons are: increased government fiscal expenditure; the second reduction in bank interest rates eased financial tensions, etc. The government authorities have such a view not only because the development of the domestic market has reached its peak, but also because with the revival of Japanese monopoly capital, since 1955, and
the prospects for foreign trade, which has become increasingly important in inverse proportion to the situation of "special procurement" orders, are becoming increasingly bleak.

According to the situation in the second quarter of 1958, Japan's commodity export markets were: North America accounted for 29.1% (the United States accounted for 23.1%), Asia accounted for 39.9% (Southeast Asia accounted for 22.2%), Africa accounted for 15%, and others. Japan-China trade, which accounted for 25% before World War II, now accounts for only 2%. Due to the political and economic oppression of US imperialism and the implementation of a pro-US policy by Japanese monopoly capital and the Japanese reactionary government, the proportion of the United States in Japan's foreign trade has increased unnaturally. However, due to the protectionist trade policy implemented by the US government, trade with the US continues to show a significant deficit. Since the crisis occurred, the proportion of Japan's trade with Southeast Asia and South America has declined rapidly. Although the proportion of trade with the US is increasing, the deficit is also increasing. Also, from the overall perspective, the economic situation in capitalist countries is not good. The temporary economic recovery in the United States caused by military inflation has deepened the financial crisis. European capitalist countries are also entering a stage of crisis sooner or later. Asian and African countries are suffering from a lack of foreign exchange and are strengthening economic ties with socialist countries. Looking domestically again, domestic demand for economic recovery has also come to an end, and it is estimated that equipment investment will not even reach half of the peak period of investment. Due to the above reasons, the market problem of the Japanese economy will become more serious.

Despite the increasingly deteriorating prospects for the market problem, the accumulation desire of monopoly capital in pursuit of maximum monopoly profits has not diminished. Last year, in the context of the crisis, overall production stagnated, but equipment in the manufacturing industry increased by an average of 10%. Among them, for example, steel industry capital relied on World Bank loans to begin implementing the third "rationalization investment." Chemical fiber industry capital strengthened cooperation with US monopoly capital organizations and began operating new industries such as the petrochemical industry. Fertilizer industry capital is trying to change the source of power with the help of financial capital. Judging from the equipment investment situation this year, the automobile industry and the cement industry are on par with last year. Although the steel industry, the petrochemical industry, the mining industry, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, and the communication equipment manufacturing industry have decreased slightly compared to last year, the power industry, the coal industry, the gas industry, the oil refining industry, the ammonium sulfate industry, the organic compound industry, and the pulp industry have shown a slight increase.

In this way, a situation will emerge: on the one hand, there is production stagnation and frequent undercapacity in the entire Japanese economy; on the other hand, various industrial sectors and enterprises are rapidly updating equipment and increasing new investment; on the one hand, there is cartelization, and on the other hand, there is anarchy of production; on the one hand, there is the closure of old factories, and on the other hand, there is the establishment of efficient new factories. In this process, the differentiation between treasonous monopoly capital and national capital deepens. On the one hand, unemployment and equipment idleness are becoming commonplace, and on the other hand, production capacity is expanding day by day, and the operating rate is declining, which has created a "recovery" of production that is increasingly incompatible with the market. This is constantly strengthening the capital export desire of monopoly organizations.

The Nobusuke Kishi government has set the growth rate of the Japanese economy this year at 5.5%, and in order to meet the above-mentioned urgent requirements of monopoly capital, it wants to create conditions for expanded reproduction by borrowing from the United States and issuing foreign bonds, and also to expand national budget expenditures. The Nobusuke Kishi government has increased fiscal investment and lending by 30% in order to expand power, steel, road and port construction projects. The funds it invested in the Export-Import Bank are 36 billion yen, four times that of fiscal year 1958. This is for capital exports, such as providing yen loans to India, providing yen loans to help Brazil build the Minas steel plant, and providing yen loans to the United Arab Republic, etc. And investment and lending in road construction increased by 82.5 billion yen compared to 1958. It should not be forgotten that this "support for basic industries" not only has the ambition to carry out economic aggression externally, but also has been combined with the Defense Agency's budget, which has begun to openly advocate "maintaining law and order" and "missileization" domestically, and is inextricably linked to the policy of reviving militarism by maintaining nuclear armament.

From this, it can be seen that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, in order to be loyal to the US-Japan monopoly capital, is trying to intensify plunder and super-exploitation in order to overcome this crisis in accordance with the direction of implementing a reactionary policy relying on military and police forces. However, this approach of stimulating production is bound to prepare conditions for a deeper and broader conflict between production and the market. This policy will increasingly arouse the resistance of the working masses. Not only that, not to mention national capitalists, even monopoly capitalists are worried that the "overheating of the economy" in the second half of this year will lead to a financial crisis. From this, it can be seen that even the monopoly capital group is skeptical about whether the anti-people and anti-national reactionary policies adopted by the Nobusuke Kishi government to cope with the crisis will help to overcome the economic crisis.

    危机笼罩下的日本经济
    日本经济学家　丰田四郎
                （一）
    被称作“神武景气”的繁荣局面（1955年至1957年春），从1957年春天起转入危机的局面。从工矿业生产指数的急剧下降情况看来，这次危机具有形成世界周期性生产过剩危机的一环或者是这种危机的序曲的性质。
    以1953年为一百，1958年5月日本的工矿业生产指数降至1957年5月的92.8％，这个比率较1957年5月同1956年5月的比率激减了30.8。在整个资本主义国家中，日本经济特别低落的原因，第一是战后日本经济丧失了帝国主义殖民地市场，而且1955至1957年狂热地进行设备更新的情况发生了反作用，第二是掌握日本经济命脉（尤其是原料、市场方面的基础）的美帝国主义把危机转嫁给日本等等。
    日本政府从去年秋天起，同美国当局配合起来，开始发表了有关日本经济“回升”的统计资料。据经济企划厅统计（以1955年为一百），从1957年4月以来开始下降的工矿业生产指数，在1958年4月降到最低点（139.75），到同年11月回升到149.1。但是，去年最高的10月份的指数也没有超过“神武景气”的最高点。如果说，1956年的指数比1955年增加22.4％，那末1958年同1957年相比，却是战后第一次出现负数的情况。而且，煤炭、肥料等工业在滞销存货增加的情况下，仍然在增加生产。因此，把生产停止减少和下降的情况叫做“回升”，是有必要加以保留的。但是，考虑到另外一些指数，岸信介政府所发表的上述资料，在某种意义上说也可以算作“回升”吧。例如：库存产品指数在去年年初是一百二十，到夏季降为一百一十，到10月更降至一百零五；又如批发物价在去年11月出现了十三个月来停止下跌的情况，等等。
    岸信介政府和一部分垄断资本家，同美国当局相呼应，正在夸大地宣传着这种“回升”。垄断资本家的组织“日本经营者团体联盟”，把这种回升看作“大规模上升”的序曲，宣传说它“显示了现代资本主义的卓越的优越性”。经济企划厅也说一年半左右的“经济衰退”已经结束，新的一年将是“经济回升的一年”，给他们打气。近来商业报纸的言论也受了这种影响。
    到目前为止，有过两次宣传日本经济“好转”的说法。第一次是在1958年5月大选的时候。当时反动势力宣传“好转”的理由是：外汇危机已经消除；股票价格、纺织品和钢铁的价格有了一些回涨。其中占主要地位的纺织品和钢铁的价格的回涨，是由于采取提供滞销贷款、设立收购机关、缩减开工率、实行卡特尔制等手段，在牺牲劳动人民和中小企业的利益的情况下取得的暂时的结果。而且，这种现象后来在批发价格下跌的同时也已经消失了。第一次宣传的“好转”的说法，就这样被事实推翻了。
    第二次“好转”的说法是“以从美国返回东京的金融实业界人士为中心”（1958年11月8日“东京新闻”），从去年秋天开始散布出来的。他们所举的“回升”的理由，第一是以去年10月为最高峰，出口有了增加，第二是缩减开工率的情况有了缓和。除了这些主要因素以外，他们还举出了这样的理由：加快了执行增设合成纤维等新产业部门计划的速度，钢铁、铜、石油的国际价格有了上涨。
    问题在于：第一，这种“回升”具有反人民反民族的内容，第二，“回升”是暂时的现象，倒可以说是加剧了生产过剩的程度。
                （二）
    从人民生活这一方面看来，最严重的情况是，这种“回升”是实行“合理化”及减缩开工率等措施的结果，这意味着工人及其他人民群众遭受到损失。
    截至1958年6月为止，垄断资本集团在半数的产业部门中把开工率平均缩减30％，来维持垄断价格，同时，为了在激烈的国内外市场争夺战中取胜，正在用“合理化投资”的办法来降低成本。结果，首先是，整顿企业和失业现象正在增加。而且，必须注意的是，政府统计的“完全失业者”（指在进行调查的一个星期内连一小时的工作都没有做的人）正在变成一种经常的现象。
    去年，金融资本在纺织品、造纸、纸浆、海运、化学等工业部门大批地解雇工人，并且把“日产化学工业公司”（生产硫铵、过磷酸，职工六千五百七十四人）、“小西六照像工业公司”（生产胶卷，职工三千六百七十二人），以及“日本氢工业公司”、“日本绝缘器材公司”等大公司作为“重点公司”重新加以改组，裁减了一部分正式工人。造船公司、中小煤矿等也解雇了间接雇用的工人和临时工。钢铁公司、“日本通运公司”，也实行了调换工人的工种的办法。同“特需”订货有关的公司每月平均裁减工人四千人。在中小企业方面，例如在泉南地方（大阪府），仅机织业就解雇了五千人。煤矿业的解雇推延到今年了。
    在公共企业方面，国营铁道（工会会员三十六万七千人）实行第一次“合理化”解雇了工人。电气通讯企业（会员十六万一千人）实行第二次“合理化”解雇了工人。邮政、专卖公司也正在进行生产及事务方面的机械化。
    大企业一面逐步改变半封建的劳动条件，一面同这种做法结合起来，逐步采用美国式的劳动管理制度（实行勤务评定、编制考绩表、推行建议制度，用公司内部通报的办法进行内部管理等），在集中起来的自动化机械体系下面，要求工人在精神非常紧张的情况下工作。在实行解雇、调换工种、三班制等办法的同时，还采用降低熟练工人的等级、简化操作程序、雇用非全日工作人员等办法，以加强资本家对工人的专制统治。而且，“合理化”措施还扩大到从属于各大企业系统的中小企业。垄断资本组织越来越加深了中小资本家依附垄断资本组织的程度，要求他们降低承包单价和提高部件的精确程度，最后，这种损失就被转嫁给工人。
    在官方统计中看不到的日本失业者和半失业者的人数，据说占人口的六分之一。垄断资本把失业大军作为一种压力，用强制办法在大企业实行职务等级工资制，在中小企业实行工作效率工资制，在零散企业实行最低工资制，并且压低了妇女劳动、中小企业工人劳动的等级。例如，去年“钟渊纺织公司”等大纺织公司把工资减低了10％。国营铁道也准备从今年7月起重新修改工资制度。据日本工会总评议会调查，因春季斗争而提高工资的比率，按日本官公厅工会协议会来说，1957年是6.2％，1958年降为1％；按日本煤矿工会系统的八个大公司工会来说，1957年是10.9％，1958年降为6％。一般地说，工资增加率减少了30％左右。与此相反，除银行外，经常在股票市场出现的四百五十六个公司在1958年7月结算时，利润率只减少20％（据“东洋经济新报社”调查）。
    垄断资本为了克服这次危机而强制实行的办法是：利用第二工会（资本家的御用工会——编者注）来分裂劳工运动；非法处分工人；利用军队和警察实行镇压。
    特别值得注意的一个新现象是，养蚕农户挤乳农户的没落和中小企业的倒闭层出不穷，不仅如此，甚至连“日产化学工业公司”和“小西六照像工业公司”那样的大工业资本也实行了从属性的改组，金融资本的资本集中正在进展着。而且，由于向世界银行借款数目的增加、关于外债的协议、对外贸易方面的依附关系，日本经济将进一步加强对美帝国主义的从属。其所以这样，主要是因为岸信介政府想要越来越加紧把日本变为美国战略体系的一环，以实行核武装为目标，按从属性的军事体制改组整个日本经济，以便按照这个方针来刺激生产的扩大。因此，岸信介政府在1958年度利用三亿一千五百万美元的借款和增加财政支出一千一百零九亿日元，使基础产业的扩充同复活军国主义结合起来，刺激了原材料的消费。例如，制造导弹、喷气式飞机、军舰等武器和发展电子工业，都已正式着手进行。
              （三）
  然则，经济企划厅本身也不能不承认，去年下半年以来的“回升”，不过是一些暂时性和人为的原因引起的。暂时性的原因是：国内需求的季节性增加；公共事业工程的提前开工；压低出口价格所造成的出口贸易旺盛情况；库存减少到一定程度以后，商品、原材料的采购量增加。人为的原因是：政府财政支出的增加；第二次降低银行利率缓和了金融紧张情况等等。政府当局所以有这样的看法，不仅是因为在国内市场的发展已经到了顶点，而且是因为在日本垄断资本复活的同时，从1955年起，和
  “特需”订货情况形成反比例、比重越来越大的对外贸易的前途越来越暗淡了。
    按照1958年第二季度情况来看，日本的商品输出市场是：北美占29.1％（美国占23.1％），亚洲占39.9％（东南亚占22.2％），非洲占15％，及其他等等。在第二次世界大战以前占25％的日中贸易，现在只占2％。由于美帝国主义的政治和经济的压迫以及日本垄断资本和日本反动政府执行对美从属的政策，美国在日本对外贸易中的比重不自然地增大了。然而，由于美国政府实行保护贸易政策，对美贸易仍然继续着显著的入超。自从发生危机以后，日本对东南亚、对南美的贸易的比重下降得很快。对美贸易所占比重虽然在增加，但逆差也日益增大。还有，从整个看来，资本主义各国经济情况不妙。美国由于军事性通货膨胀而引起的暂时的景气回升，反而加深了财政危机。欧洲资本主义国家也有迟有早地正在进入危机阶段。亚非国家正在苦于缺乏外汇，并且正在加强同社会主义国家的经济联系。再从国内来看，恢复经济的国内需要也告一段落，估计设备投资连投资最盛时期的一半也达不到。由于以上种种原因，日本经济的市场问题就将变得更加严重起来。
    尽管市场问题的前景越来越恶化，但是追求最大垄断利润的垄断资本的积累欲却没有减退。去年在危机的情况下，整个生产停滞不前，但是制造业的设备还平均增加了10％。其中，例如，钢铁工业资本依靠世界银行的贷款开始实行第三次“合理化投资”。化学纤维工业资本加强了同美国垄断资本组织的合作，开始经营石油化学工业等新工业。肥料工业资本依靠金融资本的帮助正在设法改变动力来源。从今年的设备投资情况来看，汽车工业、水泥工业同去年不相上下，钢铁工业、石油化学工业、采矿工业、电气机械制造业、通讯器材制造业虽比去年略减，但是电力工业、煤炭工业、瓦斯工业、石油精炼业、硫铵工业、有机化合工业、纸浆工业却有略增的趋势。
    这样一来，将出现这样一个局面：一方面是在整个日本经济中存在生产停滞、经常开工不足的现象，一方面各个产业部门及企业方面却迅速更新设备和增加新的投资；一方面是卡特尔化，一方面是生产的无政府状态；一方面是旧厂的倒闭，一方面是效率高的新厂的建立。在这个过程中，卖国的垄断资本和民族资本的分化加深。一面是失业和设备闲置的经常化，一面是生产能力日益膨胀，开工率下降，这就产生了日益不能同市场相适应的生产的“回升”。这又不断地加强了垄断组织的资本输出欲。
    岸信介政府把今年日本经济的增长率预定为5.5％，并且为了满足垄断资本的上述迫切要求，欲借助于向美国借款和发行国外公债，还要扩大国家预算开支，以便为扩大再生产创造条件。岸信介政府为了扩大电力、钢铁、道路及港湾建设工程，增加了30％的财政投资和放款。它向进出口银行投放的资金是三百六十亿日元，为1958年度的四倍。这是为了进行资本输出，如对印度提供日元贷款、提供帮助巴西建设米那斯钢铁厂的日元贷款，以及向阿联提供日元贷款等等。而在修建道路方面的投资和放款比1958年增加了八百二十五亿日元。不应该忘记的是，这种“基础产业的扶植”不仅有对外进行经济侵略的野心，而且在国内已经同开始公然标榜“维持治安”和“导弹化”的防卫厅预算结合起来，而同以维持核武装来复活军国主义的方针密不可分。
    由此可见，岸信介内阁为了效忠于美日垄断资本，正想按照推行依靠军警力量的反动政策的方向，加紧掠夺和进行超额剥削，以便度过这次危机。但是，这种刺激生产的作法，势必为生产同市场发生更深刻、更广泛的冲突准备条件。这个政策将会日益引起劳动群众的反抗。不仅如此，民族资本家自不待言，即便是垄断资本家也为今年下半年“景气过热”会引起财政危机而担忧。由此可见，岸信介政府为了应付危机而采取的反人民反民族的反动政策，能否有助于度过经济危机，连垄断资本集团也抱着怀疑的态度。
