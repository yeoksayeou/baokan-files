Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has written to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, requesting them to take resolute measures appropriate to the current situation in Laos, primarily to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos in order to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today published this letter, which Pham Van Dong wrote on February 4th. The letter requests the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference to note that the current situation in Laos is developing in a direction unfavorable to the peace of Laos, Vietnam, and Indochina.

The letter states: "Recently, American imperialism has strengthened its interference and activities in Laos, especially its interference and activities in the military sphere. Many American military personnel have been sent to Laos to serve as advisors to various units of the Laotian army and so-called police organizations; American military aid agencies have transported many new weapons and ammunition to Laos, where they have also intensified the expansion and construction of many military bases, airports, and strategic highways connecting Laos and South Vietnam."

The letter points out: "In order to realize American imperialism's conspiracy in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the South Vietnamese authorities, with the connivance of the Royal Laotian Government, have dispatched many disguised military personnel to Laos, using Laotian territory to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The letter also points out: "Since the Pathet Lao forces joined the Laotian national community, the Royal Laotian Government has intensified its persecution, retaliation, and discrimination against former Pathet Lao personnel – that is, former resistance personnel. This is in complete violation of Article 15 of the Geneva Agreement on Laos."

The letter says, "Instigated, aided, and coordinated by American imperialism and other foreign powers, the Kingdom of Laos has recently increased its troops on the border between Vietnam and Laos, continuously violated the airspace and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating an unstable situation on the border between the two countries. Although the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has protested repeatedly and suggested resolving these disputes through peaceful negotiations, similar incidents continue to occur, and recently they have created tension in the Xiangli area. Xiangli Township has always been the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The letter reveals that the purpose of the Kingdom of Laos in creating tension on the border is to use it as a pretext to establish a military dictatorship at home, using it as a tool to undermine the Geneva Agreement on Laos and paving the way for dragging Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

The letter emphasizes that the above-mentioned acts seriously violate Articles 6, 7, 9, and 15 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, as well as Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

The letter says: "The purpose of all these violations of the agreement is to attempt to turn Laos into an American military base and to use Laos to undermine the peace and unification of Vietnam."

Pham Van Dong concludes the letter by stating that, for the peaceful interests of the Vietnamese and Laotian people, and as a party to the Geneva Conference on Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference to "take appropriate and resolute measures appropriate to the current situation in Laos, primarily to restore the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, in order to investigate the above-mentioned violations of the agreement and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Agreement on Laos."

    范文同总理函日内瓦会议两位主席
    要求保证日内瓦协议的履行
    首先应使老挝国际委员会恢复活动
    新华社河内3日电　越南民主共和国外交部长范文同已经写信给日内瓦会议两位主席，要求两位主席采取适应老挝目前局势的坚决措施，首先是使老挝国际委员会恢复活动，以保证日内瓦协议的履行。
    越南外交部今天发表了范文同在2月4日所写的这封信。信中要求日内瓦会议两位主席注意：目前老挝局势正在朝着不利于老挝、越南和印度支那和平的方向发展。
    信中说：“最近美帝国主义加强了它在老挝的干涉和活动，特别是它在军事方面的干涉和活动。有许多美国军事人员奉派到老挝去充当老挝军队中各单位的和所谓警察组织的顾问；美国军事援助机关运送了许多新的武器和弹药到老挝，在那里还加紧扩建和新建了许多军事基地、机场以及连接老挝和南越的战略公路。”
    信中指出：“为了实现美帝国主义在印度支那和东南亚的阴谋，南越当局在老挝王国政府的纵容下，派遣了许多穿上伪装的军人到老挝，利用老挝国土来向越南民主共和国进行侦察和破坏活动。”
    信中还指出：“自从寮国战斗部队加入老挝国家共同生活之后，老挝王国政府加强了对前寮国战斗部队人员——即前抗战人员——的迫害、报复和歧视。这完全违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协定第十五条。”
    信中说，“老挝王国由于美帝国主义和其它外国的唆使、帮助和配合，最近在越南和老挝的边境增兵，连续侵犯了越南民主共和国的领空和领土，制造了两国边境的不安局势。虽然越南民主共和国政府多次抗议，并建议用和平协商的办法来解决这些纠纷，但是，类似事件仍继续发生，最近更在向立地区制造了紧张局势。而向立乡一向是越南民主共和国的领土。”
    信中揭露，老挝王国在边境制造紧张局势的目的，是要用来作为借口，以便在国内建立起军事独裁制度，用它来作为破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的工具，为把老挝拉进东南亚侵略集团开辟道路。
    信中强调声明，上述行为严重地违反了关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第六、七、九和十五条以及日内瓦会议最后宣言第四、五条。
    信中说：“所有这些违反协议的行为的目的，都是企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地，并且利用老挝来破坏越南的和平、统一。”
    范文同在信件的最后表示，越南民主共和国为了越南人民和老挝人民的和平利益，作为参加签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议的一方，要求日内瓦会议的两位主席，“采取适应老挝目前局势的适当而坚决的措施，首先是使老挝国际监督和监察委员会恢复活动，以调查上述违反协议的事件，确保关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行”。
