Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 23rd. The Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast a communiqué from the Director of the Iraqi Guidance and Broadcasting Bureau to the Iraqi people on the evening of the 22nd.

The communiqué stated, "Shawwaf's despicable conspiracy caused the painful bloodshed in Mosul. Shawwaf's conspiracy was openly planned by the United Arab Republic. The United Arab Republic, colluding with imperialists, reactionaries, and some foolish traitors within Iraq, conspired to undermine the security of the Iraqi Republic and consciously shed the innocent blood of Iraqis. The purpose of this conspiracy was to completely destroy the eternal Iraqi Republic."

The communiqué said that the army and the people, in full cooperation, had crushed this conspiracy with lightning speed. "This conspiracy has awakened all the people, strengthened their unity, and heightened their vigilance, causing them to monitor every foreign ambition and provocateur attempting to divide their ranks and create chaos among them."

The communiqué stated that Iraq is a country liberated from imperialism and a strong fortress of genuine patriotism. It is committed to strengthening Iraq's comprehensive unity and works, on a small scale, for the benefit of the people of the Iraqi Republic; and on a large scale, for the benefit of the Arab nation. Iraq is currently concentrating on national industrialization, implementing beneficial plans, and raising the people's living standards, so that Iraq can become a powerful, cultured, and civilized nation, thereby being able to provide support to its brothers beyond the Iraqi borders. All of this will be more useful than empty language and propaganda or the clownish actions of deceiving fools.

The communiqué stated, "Peace and tranquility reign throughout Iraq. Our country's economic situation will develop daily. The government of the Iraqi Republic has decided to protect Iraq's various economies, encourage and protect national enterprises, and care for the interests of the people. Iraq and the Iraqi people have sufficient spiritual and material strength to achieve all this and forever guarantee the happiness of the people."

The communiqué said that the Iraqi Cabinet meeting has decided to allocate 50,000 dinars to provide relief to the families of the victims of the painful Mosul incident. The relief funds will be supervised and distributed by the Ministry of Interior and the Guidance Department in coordination with representatives of the Ministry of Defense before Eid al-Fitr. Prime Minister Qassem has stated that he will allocate another sum after Eid al-Fitr to provide diligent support for the families of the martyrs.

    伊拉克指导和广播局局长就粉碎沙瓦夫叛乱发表公报
    伊拉克人民进一步加强团结提高警惕
    指出这次叛乱是阿联为了摧毁伊拉克共和国公开策划的
    新华社巴格达23日电　伊拉克共和国电台22日晚上发表了伊拉克指导和广播局局长给伊拉克人民的公报。
    公报说，“沙瓦夫的卑鄙阴谋造成了令人痛心的摩苏尔流血事件。沙瓦夫的阴谋是阿拉伯联合共和国公开策划的。阿拉伯联合共和国串通帝国主义分子、反动分子和伊拉克国内某些愚蠢的卖国贼阴谋破坏伊拉克共和国的安全，有意识地使伊拉克流无辜者的鲜血。制造这次阴谋的目的，就是要彻底摧毁永恒的伊拉克共和国。”
    公报说，陆军和人民全面合作，已以迅雷不及掩耳之势粉碎了这次阴谋。“这次阴谋唤醒了全体人民，加强了他们的团结，提高了他们的警惕，使他们要监视每一个企图分裂他们队伍和在他们中间制造混乱的外来野心分子和挑拨者。”
    公报说，伊拉克是从帝国主义手中解放出来的国家，是真实的爱国主义的强大堡垒。它致力于加强伊拉克的全面统一，它在小范围内，为伊拉克共和国人民的利益而工作；在大范围内，为阿拉伯民族的利益而工作。伊拉克目前正专心致志于国家工业化，实施有益计划，提高人民的生活水平，使伊拉克成为一个强大的有文化的文明国家，从而能够给伊拉克国境以外的兄弟们以支援。这一切，比之空洞的语言和宣传或骗骗蠢人的小丑行动，将更为有用。
    公报说，“伊拉克全境太平无事。我们国家的经济情况将日益发展。伊拉克共和国政府已决定保护伊拉克的各种经济，鼓励和保护民族企业，关心人民利益。伊拉克和伊拉克人民有足够的精神力量和物质力量，来实现这一切并永远保证人民幸福。”
    公报说，伊拉克内阁会议已决定拨款五万第纳尔，抚恤痛心的摩苏尔事件受难的家属。抚恤金将由内政部和指导部协同国防部代表，在开斋节前监督发放。卡塞姆总理已经声明，他将在开斋节后再拨出一笔款项，作为认真赡养烈士家属之用。
