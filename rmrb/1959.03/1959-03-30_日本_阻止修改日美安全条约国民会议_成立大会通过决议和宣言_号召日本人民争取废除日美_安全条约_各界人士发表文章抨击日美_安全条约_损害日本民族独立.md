Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 29th: Representatives of Japanese political parties and people's organizations participating in the founding大会 (dà huì, grand meeting) of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" held in Tokyo on the 28th, unanimously called on the Japanese people to strengthen the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" until the treaty is abolished.

Approximately 600 representatives from 134 Japanese political parties, labor unions, peace organizations, and various people's groups participated in the founding大会.  Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party; Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japan Communist Party; Akira Kazami, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations; Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association; Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; and many other prominent figures from various sectors of Japanese society spoke at the meeting.  In their speeches, they unanimously emphasized the importance of establishing the National Conference.

The resolution, unanimously adopted by the大会, pointed out that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" would not only lead to strengthening this military treaty, but also to the conclusion of a military alliance between Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, and the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea.

The resolution stated that after the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it would "legitimize" the nuclear armament of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" and their dispatch abroad; the path for Japan to restore diplomatic relations with China would be blocked; Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands would become permanent U.S. nuclear bases; and at the same time, it would pave the way for completely abolishing the national constitution and undermining Japanese democracy through strengthened control and suppression measures.

The resolution also stated that the true security of the Japanese people depends on the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the pursuit of a neutral policy of not participating in any military bloc.

The大会 unanimously adopted a declaration condemning the secret negotiations between the Japanese government and the United States regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and called on the Japanese people to engage in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" even more actively than they did last fall against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The大会 also unanimously adopted a program of action for the future. The goals of the program of action are: to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demand the abolition of the treaty; and to strive for Japan to pursue a neutral policy. The program calls for actively carrying out propaganda work to achieve this goal, and calling on the people to actively participate in the movement to expose the Japanese government's war plans.

The program of action stipulates that a joint struggle organization against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be established, and that thousands upon thousands of resolutions against the treaty should be passed in factories and townships.  The program stipulates that April 15th be designated as a unified action day to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." On this day, rallies will be held in factories throughout the country, and extensive propaganda activities will be carried out in the streets.

The program also requires candidates participating in the upcoming参议员 (cānyìyuán, councillor) and local elections to express their attitude on the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 28th: Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in the April issue of "世界" (Shìjiè, The World) magazine, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality.

He pointed out that if the conspiracy of the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government to revise the "Security Treaty" succeeds, the United States will inevitably transport nuclear weapons into Japan, and Japan will become an advanced base for U.S. nuclear weapons. Once the United States goes to war with other countries, Japan will be dragged into a devastating war.  In this way, not only will peace in Asia not be maintained, but Japan's security will also be undermined.

Shiga also pointed out that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will further cause Japan to lose its independence and further worsen Japan-China relations.

Shiga said that now is the time to concentrate the people's strength to strive for the abolition of this treaty.  Not only that, Japan should implement such an active policy: driving the U.S. military out of Japan, forcing the United States to remove its military bases in Japan, making Japan one of the non-nuclear-armed regions in the Pacific, and becoming a peaceful, democratic, and independent country, establishing diplomatic relations with all countries on an equal basis.

Tomomi Narita, Director-General of the Japan Socialist Party, pointed out in an article published in the same issue of "世界" magazine that the act of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with the open aim of being hostile to China is incompatible with the Kishi government's expression of opening up the deadlock in Japan-China relations.  Narita said: For the sake of Asian peace and Japan's independence and security, and in order to open up the deadlock in Japan-China relations, we demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately stop negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" and abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in accordance with the people's demands.

He said that establishing a collective security system with China, the Soviet Union, Japan, and the United States as the main members, and concluding non-aggression treaties between the countries before that, is the only concrete policy and guideline for maintaining peace in Asia and ensuring Japan's independence and security.

Tadataka Sata, former Director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, pointed out that in order to achieve and guarantee complete independence, peace, and security, Japan must get rid of the U.S.-Japan "security guarantee" system.  The U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should not be revised, but should be abolished.

Sata pointed out that revising the "Security Treaty" will also strengthen Japan's policy of hostility toward China, making relations between the two countries more tense.

Sata finally said that Japan should first get rid of its subordination to the United States and liberate itself from the U.S.-Japan "security guarantee" system so that it can coexist peacefully with neighboring countries.  Restoring diplomatic relations with China is also an important link.

Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointed out that as a result of revising the "Security Treaty," Japan's military dependence on the United States will deepen, military expenditures in the budget will increase, workers' wages and people's social insurance situation will deteriorate, people's lives will be greatly and adversely affected, and the path for Japan's political and economic development in a democratic direction will be seriously hindered.  Therefore, it is necessary to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty."

Ota said that the Soviet Union has ended the state of war with Japan and restored peace.  China is carrying out peaceful construction at an amazing speed, and there are only friendly conditions there, and there will be no military threat to Japan.  In this case, revising the "Security Treaty" in order to fight alongside the U.S. military can only make Japan act as a pawn of the United States and undermine peace in Asia.

He said that Japan's security cannot be achieved by turning Japan into a link in the U.S. atomic strategy system, but should fundamentally change the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's foreign policy.

Minoru Takano, former Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, advocated crushing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said that 1959 is the year that the Japanese people will hold high the banner of abolishing the "Security Treaty" and concentrate all their strength on attacking the "security guarantee" system. He expressed his hope that the struggle to abolish the "Security Treaty" will be victorious.

Historian Goro Hani pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a military treaty that violates the Japanese Constitution and ignores the will of the Japanese people. Based on this alone, the Japanese people have ample reason to demand the abolition of this treaty.

Literary critic Kiyoshi Aono said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Security Treaty" will increase the risk of Japan being involved in a nuclear war, lead Japan down the path of destruction, and will further worsen Japan-China relations.

Commentator Yoko Matsuoka pointed out that if the "Security Treaty" is revised according to the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan, the color of the U.S.-Japan military alliance will be further strengthened, the tense situation in Asia will be further intensified, and Japan's independence will be further damaged, threatening Japan's security.

Japanese Christian pastor Junichi Asano also expressed opposition to revising the "Security Treaty." He hoped that Japan would adopt a peaceful policy.

Hachiro Arita, former Foreign Minister of the Socialist Party, said that revising the "Security Treaty" according to the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan will seriously endanger peace in Asia and worsen relations between Japan and China and other Asian countries. He advocated that Japan change its "leaning to one side" toward the United States and implement a neutral policy.

    日本“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”成立大会通过决议和宣言
    号召日本人民争取废除日美“安全条约”
    各界人士发表文章抨击日美“安全条约”损害日本民族独立
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：参加28日在东京举行的“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”成立大会的日本各政党和人民团体的代表在会上发表讲话时，一致号召日本人民加强反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，直到这项条约被废除时为止。
    参加这次成立大会的，有日本的一百三十四个政党、工会、和平组织和各人民团体的大约六百多名代表。日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎，日本共产党总书记宫本显治，恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议议长风见章，日本中国文化交流协会会长片山哲，日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一以及日本各界其他许多著名人士都在会上讲话。他们在讲话中还一致强调指出了成立国民会议的重要意义。
    大会一致通过的决议指出，修改日美“安全条约”不仅会导致加强这项军事条约，而且会导致日本、台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜李承晚集团之间缔结军事联盟。
    决议说，修改日美“安全条约”以后，将使核武装日本“自卫队”和把它派往国外“合法化”；日本同中国恢复外交关系的道路将被堵塞；冲绳岛和小笠原群岛将变为美国的永久性的核基地；同时，还将为彻底废除国家宪法、通过加强控制和镇压措施来破坏日本民主铺平道路。
    决议还说，日本人民的真正安全有赖于废除日美“安全条约”，并且奉行不参加任何军事集团的中立政策。
    大会一致通过了一项宣言，谴责日本政府同美国举行的关于修改日美“安全条约”的秘密谈判，并且号召日本人民比去年秋天反对
  “警察官职务执行法”修正案时更加积极地来进行反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    大会还一致通过了今后的行动纲领，行动纲领的目标是：阻止修改日美“安全条约”，并要求废除这项条约；争取使日本奉行中立政策。纲领要求为实现这个目标而积极展开宣传工作，号召人民积极参加揭露日本政府的好战计划的运动。
    行动纲领规定，要建立反对日美“安全条约”的联合斗争组织，在工厂和乡镇中应当通过成千上万的反对这项条约的决议。纲领规定把4月15日定为阻止修改日美“安全条约”的统一行动日，在这一天，全国各地的工厂都将举行集会，并且将在街道上广泛展开宣传活动。
    纲领还要求参加即将举行的参议员和地方选举的候选人就修改日美“安全条约”问题表示态度。
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会委员志贺义雄在4月号“世界”杂志上发表文章，要求废除日美“安全条约”，实行和平中立的政策。
    他指出，如果美国和岸信介政府修改“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，美国必然要把核武器运进日本，日本将会变成美国的核武器前哨基地。一旦美国同其他国家作战，日本将被卷入毁灭性的战争中。这样，不仅亚洲的和平得不到维护，日本的安全也将遭到破坏。
    志贺还指出，修改日美“安全条约”将使日本进一步丧失它的独立，并且使日中关系进一步恶化。
    志贺说，现在应该集中人民的力量来争取废除这个条约。不仅如此，日本应该实行这样的积极政策：把美军从日本赶出去，迫使美国撤除它在日本的军事基地，使日本成为太平洋非核武装地区之一，成为和平、民主的独立国家，同所有国家在平等的基础上建立邦交。
    日本社会党总务局长成田知巳在同期“世界”杂志上发表的文章中指出，公然以同中国为敌为目的来修改日美“安全条约”的行动是和岸信介政府所作出的打开日中关系僵局的表示不相容的。成田说：为了亚洲和平和日本的独立与安全，为了打开日中关系僵局，我们要求岸信介政府立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判，并且根据人民的要求废除日美“安全条约”。
    他说，建立以中、苏、日、美四国为主要成员的集体安全体系，并且在这以前在各国之间缔结互不侵犯条约，是维护亚洲和平和保障日本的独立与安全的唯一具体的方针政策。
    日本社会党前国际局长佐多忠隆指出，为了实现和保障完全独立、和平和安全，日本必须摆脱日美“安全保障”体制。日美“安全条约”不是应该修改，而是应该废除。
    佐多指出，修改“安全条约”还将会加强日本敌视中国的政策，使两国关系更加紧张。
    佐多最后说，日本首先应该摆脱对美国的隶属关系，从日美“安全保障”体制中解放出来，这样才能同邻近国家和平共处。同中国恢复邦交也是重要的一环。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏指出，修改“安全条约”的结果，将加深日本在军事上对美国的从属性，增加预算中的军事开支，工人的工资和人民的社会保险情况将会恶化，人民生活将受到很大的恶劣影响，日本的政治和经济向民主方向发展的道路将受到严重的阻碍。因此，必须反对修改“安全条约”。
    太田熏说，苏联已经同日本结束了战争状态，恢复了和平。中国正在以惊人的速度在进行和平建设，那里只存在着友好的条件，而不会对日本有什么军事威胁。在这种情况下，要修改“安全条约”以便同美军共同作战，只能使日本充当美国的马前卒而破坏亚洲和平。
    他说，日本的安全不可能根据把日本变成美国原子战略体系的一环的办法来达到，而应该根本改变岸信介内阁的外交方针。
    日本工会总评议会前任事务局长高野实主张粉碎日美“安全条约”。他说，1959年是日本人民高举废除“安全条约”的旗帜，集中全部力量打击“安全保障”体制的一年。他表示期望废除“安全条约”的斗争获得胜利。
    历史学家羽仁五郎指出，日美“安全条约”是违反日本宪法、忽视日本人民意志的一个军事条约，仅仅根据这一点，日本人民就有充分的理由要求废除这个条约。
    文艺评论家青野季吉说，岸信介政府修改“安全条约”将增加日本卷入核战争的危险，使日本走上毁灭的道路，并且将使日中关系更加恶化。
    评论家松冈洋子指出，如果根据岸信介政府的计划修改“安全条约”，日美军事同盟的色彩将进一步加强，亚洲的紧张局势将更加剧，并且将进一步损害日本的独立，威胁日本的安全。
    日本基督教牧师浅野顺一也表示反对修改“安全条约”，他希望日本采取和平政策。
    社会党前外务相有田八郎说，根据岸信介政府的计划修改“安全条约”，将严重危害亚洲和平，并且使日本和中国以及其他亚洲国家间的关系恶化。他主张日本改变向美国“一边倒”的状态，实行中立政策。（附图片）
