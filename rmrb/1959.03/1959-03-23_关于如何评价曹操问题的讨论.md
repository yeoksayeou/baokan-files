Discussion on How to Evaluate Cao Cao

How to evaluate Cao Cao is one of the issues currently being discussed in academic circles. This discussion was triggered by the newly compiled Beijing opera "Battle of Red Cliffs" and Guo Moruo's new historical drama "Cai Wenji." The discussion began with Guo Moruo's article "On Cai Wenji's 'Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute,'" published in the Guangming Daily on January 25th. Subsequently, Guangming Daily published a series of articles. As of March 20th, nine articles have been published by Jian Bozan, the Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group of Hebei Beijing Normal College, Liu Yibing, Weisheng, Yuan Liangjun, Rong Sheng, Wang Kunlun, Wu Han, and Li Zongbai.

Negating Cao Cao is the Result of the Orthodox Historical View of Feudalism

Guo Moruo, in his article discussing Cao Cao, believes that Cao Cao made outstanding contributions to politics, economy, and culture at the time. He said: "Cao Cao's contribution to the nation should be highly evaluated, and he should be called a national hero." However, since the establishment of the so-called orthodox concept since the Song Dynasty, this outstanding historical figure has suffered injustice. After the popularity of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," people regarded him as a bad person, a treacherous official with a white face, which is a major distortion of history. He believes that "Although Cao Cao started by attacking the Yellow Turbans, we can say that he inherited the Yellow Turban movement and organized it." Cao Cao eliminated the powerful, suppressed mergers, helped the poor and weak, and promoted agricultural reclamation. After more than 30 years of painstaking management, he basically reordered the entire society that had collapsed at the end of the Han Dynasty, so that the peasants in northern China basically achieved some adjustments to their centuries-old desire for land. The Xiongnu, who had been a major problem in northern China since the Yin Dynasty, almost turned into counties and prefectures in his hands. He also went far to Liaodong to pacify the newly rising Wuhuan. Culturally, he formed the climax of Jian'an literature in the history of Chinese literature.

Jian Bozan's basic viewpoint is the same as Guo Moruo's. He said that Cao Cao was not only a first-class politician, military strategist, and poet among the Three Kingdoms nobles, but also one of the outstanding figures in Chinese feudal society. "He consistently regarded the unification of China as his political mission. Although he did not complete the task of unification, he ended the long-term warlord melee since the end of the Han Dynasty, eliminated the threat of nomadic peoples from the northwestern border of China, protected the cities and villages of the Yellow River Plain, restored the feudal order in the north and south of the Yellow River, and paved the way for the later unification of the Western Jin Dynasty." In the process of negating Cao Cao, "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" exhausted its literary abilities and was simply a slander book of Cao Cao. The author clearly knew that Cao Cao was not as bad or incompetent as he said, but in order to promote the feudal orthodox historical view, he wantonly distorted history and belittled Cao Cao. He not only wrote the history of the Three Kingdoms into a farce, but also allowed later generations to regard his farce as the history of the Three Kingdoms. The reason why feudal rulers did not like Cao Cao was because they were afraid that Cao Cao's "ambition of disobedience" would spread and affect their feudal rule. Therefore, modifying Cao Cao's facial makeup is not only a matter of restoring Cao Cao's reputation, but also a matter of eliminating the orthodox historical view. He believes that Cao Cao's biggest shortcoming was in fighting the Yellow Turbans. He said that although Cao Cao incorporated the Yellow Turbans, it was his attempt to use the peasants' armed forces to achieve his political goals. However, Cao Cao was accused of being a treacherous official not because he fought the Yellow Turbans, but because he "usurped" the Han Dynasty. Because of this, we are overturning the case for him. In fact, Cao Cao did not "usurp" the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao's world was won by himself. Later, Cao Pi's claim to the throne objectively conformed to the wishes of the people at that time. If Cao Cao is to be rehabilitated on the stage, it is not enough to put a little light red on Cao Cao's face. It is clear that as long as there is still white powder on Cao Cao's face, as long as white powder is still a sign of a treacherous official or a bad person, Cao Cao cannot be removed from the hat of a treacherous official, and Cao Cao's reputation cannot be restored.

Rong Sheng also completely agreed with Guo Moruo's views in his article "On the Authenticity of Cao Cao's Image in 'Cai Wenji'."

The Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group of Hebei Beijing Normal College believes that Cao Cao does have a progressive side, but he also undeniably has a reactionary side in politics, that is, Cao Cao's suppression of peasant uprisings and the massacre of the people. They also said that politically evaluating Cao Cao cannot be equated with evaluating Cao Cao from a literary perspective.

Cao Cao is Regarded as a Treacherous Official Because He Committed Serious Crimes Against the People

Liu Yibing disagreed with Jian Bozan's statement that Cao Cao was regarded as a treacherous official because people wore orthodox glasses. He said that this is not entirely the case. "The main reason is that Cao Cao committed serious crimes against the people": madly suppressing peasant uprisings, massacring the working people, colluding with powerful families, colluding with aristocratic landlords, cruelly enslaving the people, and Cao Cao's nature was fierce and treacherous. At the same time, he believes that the division of the Three Kingdoms has its social and economic reasons. Since the Han Dynasty, the local economy of Yang, Jing, and Yi prefectures in the south has gradually developed, while the north has been severely damaged by long-term wars and cannot unify China. This is an objective law that Cao Cao cannot resist. And the people did not want war, let alone Cao Cao to "unify." The Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao was defeated, the reason lies in this. Therefore, he also disagreed with Guo Moruo calling Cao Cao a "national hero." Although Liu Yibing also agreed that Cao Cao was talented, especially in the history of literature should be affirmed, but he believes that he cannot be lenient to him because he is talented. In addition, he also made some defenses for the author of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

Yuan Liangjun believes that "Cao Cao's success was built on the failure of the Yellow Turbans. Under his feet, I don't know how many heads and bones of the Yellow Turban peasants were trampled on. This is an undeniable problem, and this is Cao Cao's unforgivable crime." If we admit that the Yellow Turbans were the driving force of historical progress at that time, and were just, then we cannot but admit that Cao Cao was reactionary on this issue. He believes that Guo Moruo and Jian Bozan intentionally or unintentionally ignored this issue, which is lenient to Cao Cao and unfair to the Yellow Turbans. Therefore, he believes that when affirming Cao Cao's achievements, this aspect that cannot be ignored cannot be ignored.

Weisheng believes that Cao Cao is a figure that we should affirm. We cannot innocently put him into hell, but we cannot praise him to the sky either. He said that Cao Cao was an individualistic ambitionist, but because his political and military measures were in line with the objective general trend of the people's demand for national reunification as soon as possible, although he did not achieve "the world belongs to the heart," he did create the necessary conditions for the later unification of China by the Sima family. Therefore, his glorious position in Chinese history should be affirmed. But like Liu Yibing and Yuan Liangjun, he believes that attributing the rise of Jian'an literature to Cao Cao's advocacy is not in line with historical facts.

The Historical Cao Cao and the Cao Cao on the Stage Should Be Treated Differently

Wang Kunlun believes that throughout the ages, people have analyzed history and evaluated figures based on their own era situation, their own thoughts and feelings, so that they can serve themselves. Therefore, for many ancient people, they are often "covered" but cannot be "concluded." Since the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, "people's hearts miss the Han," and "being in Cao's camp but with a heart in the Han" is the universal patriotic feeling of the Chinese people. In this way, Zhuge Liang became the embodiment of wisdom, and Cao Cao became the typical treacherous hero. The Cao Cao on the stage has a distance from the real Cao Cao in history. Therefore, "Cao Cao has suffered a great wrong, and there is no objective reason. If it is said that this is entirely due to the dominance of the ruling class's orthodox propaganda, then it ignores the choices of the broad masses of the people for many years." He said that we can re-evaluate Cao Cao correctly based on historical truth; at the same time, it is also necessary to objectively analyze the emotions of love and hate of the people for many years, and admit that the Cao Cao on the stage is a typical figure shaped by the people themselves for many years. Understand that artistic truth and historical truth can be consistent or not completely consistent. Cao Cao was an outstanding figure in ancient Chinese history, which cannot be denied, but Cao Cao also has the outstanding killings and treachery that the people hate the most. In order to express their hatred for all cruel and treacherous character qualities, people put a white face on Cao Cao and asked him to serve as a symbol of this type of person. Therefore, what people hate is already a conceptual Cao Cao, which exceeds the historically true Cao Cao. It cannot be denied that Cao Cao has been shouldering the important roles of constituting the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, highlighting the contrast between good and bad, and stimulating the audience's emotions. He has long served as a negative teacher for the people and has done good things. If the white face of Cao Cao is suddenly wiped off and appears in traditional Beijing operas with the appearance of a good person, then the opposite side and the image of the characters on the stage will have to be re-handled, and many Three Kingdoms dramas will have to be greatly adapted. Whether it can be approved by the audience is a question. He believes that it is not possible to mechanically require that the typical characters on the stage conform to historical truth.

In terms of Cao Cao's entire career, his merits outweigh his demerits

Wu Han said that he basically agreed that Cao Cao's personality has two sides. That is, there is a capable minister side, and there is also a treacherous hero side; there are advantages, and there are also disadvantages. He said that the reason for judging Cao Cao as a treacherous hero is not simple. This is related to the ancient people's concept of patriotism and loyalty to the monarch; to love the country, one must be loyal to the monarch, and not being loyal to the monarch is not loving the country. If the emperor is gone, he will lose the object of loyalty and love, and he will also lose the order of peace, unity, and stability. As for who the emperor is and what he looks like, it doesn't matter much. The important thing is to have a unified government and legal system. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, there were years of melee, and the people suffered enough. The symbol of the Han Dynasty emperor became the centripetal force of the people. Loyalty to the emperor is also loving the country. Cao Cao controlled the tool of Emperor Xian of Han, organized a strong and powerful government, and promulgated decrees restricting powerful families, which also adapted to the people's desire for unity and peace and conformed to the requirements of the times. If it is said that Cao Cao's coercion of the Han emperor is a treacherous official, then, conversely, if Cao Cao did not coerce, the Han Dynasty would have been finished long ago. The division of the Central Plains region has been prolonged. What benefits are there for the people? In the past nine hundred years, scolding him as a treacherous official was due to the role played by the past feudal system and feudal morality. Today, when evaluating Cao Cao, we should calculate from the role he played for the people at that time. Did he promote the progress of the times, or the opposite? "I think the word 'treacherous' of the treacherous hero, this hat can be removed. This case can be overturned." He believes that it is unfair to scold Cao Cao alone for suppressing the Yellow Turbans. Cao Cao made great contributions to the people at that time. He promoted historical progress and occupied an important position in history. Of course, Cao Cao also committed many crimes. These crimes are very large when arranged one by one, but in terms of Cao Cao's entire career, his merits outweigh his demerits. Therefore, Cao Cao, as a historical figure, should be affirmed in his historical status. However, he also believes that historical figures should not be completely equated with the characters in artistic works. The old Cao Cao plays can still be performed as they are, and chaotic overturning of cases will mess up good plays.

Li Zongbai also said: The historical Cao Cao, as a heroic figure, he deserves it. But it cannot be denied that behind his majestic literary and military achievements, there are indeed some shortcomings in moral character, and these shortcomings are precisely what the masses of the people do not like. Then the masses of the people stand on their own perspective and use the form of drama art to expose and ridicule and satirize this feudal ruler. I think this should be very natural. Therefore, the view that not wiping off Cao Cao's pink and white face on the stage is "the embodiment of the feudal orthodox historical view in historical dramas" is worth pondering. He said that the treatment of Cao Cao in drama art has always been very unfair, exaggerating the ugly side of Cao Cao's moral character; erasing the excellent side of Cao Cao's moral character. He believes that stage performances should give a comprehensive reflection and fair evaluation of Cao Cao's life deeds. As for wiping off Cao Cao's pink and white face or painting him with other colors, there are great difficulties from the perspective of drama art.

### 关于如何评价曹操问题的讨论

    关于如何评价曹操问题的讨论
    如何评价曹操，是目前学术界正在讨论的问题之一。这个讨论，是从新编京剧“赤壁之战”，和郭沫若新编历史剧“蔡文姬”引起来的。讨论的文章始见于1月25日光明日报所载郭沫若的“谈蔡文姬的‘胡笳十八拍’”一文。随后，光明日报陆续发表了一些文章。截至3月20日，已发表有翦伯赞、河北北京师范学院古典文学教研组、刘亦冰、微声、袁良骏、戎笙、王昆仑、吴晗、李宗白等的九篇文章。
    否定曹操是封建正统历史观作祟
    郭沫若在文章中谈到曹操时认为，曹操对当时的政治、经济、文化都有杰出的贡献。他说：“曹操对于民族的贡献是应该作高度评价的，他应该被称为一位民族英雄”。然而，自宋以来，所谓正统观念确定了之后，这位杰出的历史人物就蒙受了不白之冤。“三国演义”风行后，人们更把他当成坏人，当成一个粉脸的奸臣，实在是历史上的一大歪曲。他认为“曹操虽然是攻打黄巾起家的，但我们可以说他是承继了黄巾运动，把这一运动组织化了”。曹操锄豪强、抑兼并、济贫弱、兴屯田，费了三十多年的苦心经营，把汉末崩溃了的整个社会基本上重新秩序化了，使北部中国的农民千百年来要求土地的渴望基本上得到了一些调剂。自殷代以来即为中国北边大患的匈奴，到他手里，几乎化为了郡县。他还远远到辽东去把新起的乌桓平定了。他在文化上更在中国文学史中形成了建安文学的高潮。
    翦伯赞的基本观点和郭沫若的一样。他说曹操不仅是三国豪族中第一流的政治家、军事家和诗人，并且是中国封建社会有数的杰出人物。“他一贯地把统一中国当作自己的政治使命，虽然他没有完成统一的任务，但是他结束了汉末以来长期存在的豪族混战局面，并且从中国的西北边疆排除了游牧种族的威胁，保卫了黄河平原的城市和农村，恢复了黄河南北的封建秩序，替后来的西晋统一，铺平了道路。”在否定曹操的过程中，“三国演义”是尽了文学的能事，简直是曹操的谤书，作者明明知道曹操并不如他说的那样坏，那样愚蠢无能，但是为了宣传封建正统主义的历史观，他就肆意地歪曲了历史，贬斥曹操，他不仅把三国的历史写成了滑稽剧，而且还让后来的人把他写的滑稽剧当作三国的历史。封建统治者之所以不喜欢曹操，则是怕曹操的“不逊之志”流传，影响他们的封建统治。所以修改曹操的脸谱，不仅是恢复曹操名誉的问题，而且是消灭正统历史观的问题。他认为曹操的最大缺点是在于打黄巾。他说，虽然曹操收编了黄巾，但这是他企图利用农民的武装来实现自己的政治目的。不过，曹操之被指为奸臣，并不是因为他打了黄巾，而是因为他“篡”汉。因为如此，我们才替他打翻案。事实上曹操也并没有“篡”汉，曹操的天下是他自己打的，后来曹丕的称帝，在客观上也是符合当时人民的愿望的。如果要让曹操在舞台上翻身，仅仅在曹操脸上涂上一点淡红色是不够的。很明白，只要曹操脸上还有白粉，只要白粉还是奸臣或坏人的记号，就不能替曹操摘掉奸臣的帽子，不能替曹操恢复名誉。
    戎笙在他的“谈‘蔡文姬’中曹操形象的真实性”一文中也完全同意了郭沫若的观点。
    河北北京师范学院古典文学教研组认为，曹操确有其进步的一面，但在政治上也不可辩驳地有他反动的一面，这就是曹操镇压农民起义，屠杀人民。并说，从政治上评价曹操与从文学上评价曹操不能等同起来。
    把曹操目为奸臣是因为他对人民犯了严重罪行
    刘亦冰不同意翦伯赞说曹操被目为奸臣是因为人们戴着正统主义眼镜。他说，这不尽然，“主要的原因是曹操给人民犯下了严重的罪行”：疯狂地镇压农民起义、屠杀劳动人民，联络豪族、勾结士族地主，残酷地奴役人民，和曹操的本性凶残、奸诈。同时，他认为，三国的分立是有其社会经济原因的，自汉以来，南方扬、荆、益诸州地方经济逐步发展，而北方经长期战争，破坏很甚，不可能统一中国，这是客观规律，非曹操所能抗拒。而人民不希望战争，更不希望曹操来“统一”，赤壁之战，曹操大败，原因就在此。因此，他也不同意郭沫若把曹操称为“民族英雄”。刘亦冰虽然也同意说曹操有才能，特别是在文学史上应该肯定，但他认为不能因为有才能就宽容他。此外，他又为“三国演义”的作者进行了一些辩白。
    袁良骏认为，“曹操的成功正是建筑在黄巾失败的基础上，在他的脚下，正不知践踏了多少黄巾农民的头颅和白骨，这是不容否认的问题，这是曹操的不可饶恕的罪状。”如果我们承认黄巾是当时历史前进的推动力量，是正义的，就不能不承认曹操在这个问题上是反动的。他认为郭沫若和翦伯赞是有意无意地忽视了这个问题，这是对曹操的宽厚，对黄巾的不公平。因此他认为在肯定曹操的功绩时，不能忽视这个不容忽视的方面。
    微声认为，曹操是我们应该肯定的人物，不能无辜地把他打入地狱，但也不能把他捧上了天。他说，曹操是个个人主义野心家，但由于他的政治军事措施是适应人民要求国家尽快统一的客观总趋势，尽管他未做到“天下归心”，毕竟为后来司马氏的统一中国，创造了必要的条件，所以他在中国历史上的光荣地位是应该肯定的。但他和刘亦冰、袁良骏一样认为把建安文学之兴归功于曹操的提倡是不合乎史实的。
    历史上的曹操和舞台上的曹操应该区别对待
    王昆仑认为，古往今来，人们都是要根据自己的时代处境，自己的思想情感来分析历史，评价人物，使其为自己服务，因而对许多古人常是“盖棺”而不能“定论”。宋、元、明、清以来，“人心思汉”，“身在曹营心在汉”是我国人民普遍的爱国感情，这样，诸葛亮就成了智慧的化身，曹操就成了奸雄的典型，舞台上的曹操就和历史上真实的曹操发生了距离。所以，“曹操受了很大的冤枉，也不是没有客观理由的。如果说这完全由于统治阶级正统主义宣传的支配，那就忽略了多少年来广大人民自己的选择。”他说，我们可以根据历史真实重新给曹操以正确的评价；同时，也必要客观地分析多少年来人民爱憎的情感，对舞台上的曹操要承认他是一个多年来人民自己所塑造的典型。理解到艺术真实和历史真实，可以一致也可以不完全一致。曹操在中国古代史上是一个杰出的人物，不能否认，但曹操也具有人民所最痛恨的突出的残杀和奸诈，人们为了表示对一切残忍奸诈的性格品质的憎恨，就给曹操涂上白脸，请他担任这一类人物的象征。因此人们所恨的已经是概念的曹操，超过了历史真实的曹操了。不能否认曹操已经担负着构成敌我矛盾、突出好坏对比和激动观众感情的重要脚色，长期地给人民充当了反面教员，做了好事，如果忽然把曹操的白脸擦掉，以好人的面貌出现在传统京戏中，那末舞台上的对立面和人物形象都要重新处理，许多出三国戏都来一个大改编，能不能得到观众的批准是个疑问。他认为不能机械地要求舞台上的人物典型都符合历史真实。
    就曹操整个事业来说他是功大于过
    吴晗说，他基本上同意说曹操人格有两面性。即有能臣的一面，又有奸雄的一面；有优点，也有缺点。他说，将曹操评定为奸雄的原因并不简单。这是和古代人的爱国观念与忠君观念连用有关的；要爱国就得忠君，不忠君也就不爱国。皇帝没有了，也就失去了忠、爱的对象，也就失去了和平、统一、安定的秩序。至于皇帝是什么人，什么样子，那倒关系不大。重要的是要有一个统一的政府和法制。东汉末年，连年混战，人民吃够了苦头，汉朝皇帝的这一象征就成为人民向心的力量，忠于皇帝也就是爱国。曹操掌握了汉献帝这一工具，组织了强而有力的政府，颁布限制豪强的法令，也就适应了人民要求统一和平的愿望，符合了时代的要求。要说曹操挟汉帝就是奸臣，那末，反过来，曹操不挟，汉朝早就完了。中原地区分裂局面延长了，对人民有什么好处？过去九百多年来骂他作奸臣，是由于过去的封建体制、封建道德所起的作用。今天评价曹操，应该从他对当时人民所起的作用来算账，是推动时代进步呢，还是相反？“我认为奸雄的奸字，这个帽子是可以摘掉的。这个案是可以翻的。”他认为就镇压黄巾事单骂曹操是不公道的，曹操对当时人民有很大功绩，他推动了历史进步，在历史上占有重要地位。当然曹操也犯了不少罪过，这些罪过排列起来一条条都很大，但就曹操整个事业来说，却是功大于过。所以曹操作为历史人物，在历史地位上是应当肯定的。但是，他也认为历史人物不应该和艺术作品中的人物完全等同起来，旧戏中的曹操戏照样可以演，乱翻案会把好戏都翻乱了的。
    李宗白也说：历史上的曹操，做为一个英雄人物他是受之无愧的。但也不能否认在他那些雄伟的文治武功背后，也确实存在若干道德品质上的缺点，而这些缺点又正是人民群众所不喜欢的，那么人民群众站在自己的角度上，通过戏曲艺术形式对这个封建的统治者给以揭露，并加以嘲笑、讽刺，我想这应该是很自然的事情。因此那种认为在舞台上不给曹操擦去粉白脸，就是“封建正统主义历史观在历史剧中的体现”的说法，就值得商榷了。他说，历来戏曲艺术对曹操的处理确是很不公平的，夸大了曹操道德品质上的丑陋的一面；抹煞了曹操道德品质上的优秀的一面。他认为舞台表演应该对曹操生平事迹给以全面反映和公平估价。至于要擦去曹操的粉白脸，或是给他涂上点别的颜色，从戏曲艺术角度来看有很大的困难。
