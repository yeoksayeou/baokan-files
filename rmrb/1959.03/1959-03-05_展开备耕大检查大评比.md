    Launch a Great Inspection and Comparison of Spring Plowing Preparations

    Many regions are organizing large-scale inspections and comparisons of spring plowing preparations. It is necessary to inspect and compare sowing plans and production targets; to inspect and compare measures for increasing production and revolutionary enthusiasm; and, more importantly, to inspect and compare whether the specific measures and material preparations, as well as technical preparations, are adapted to the targets for increased production. Check each item one by one, compare each item one by one, immediately popularize experiences, and quickly solve problems. This mass-based great inspection and comparison will undoubtedly play a significant role in promoting the current spring plowing preparations.

    Large-scale mass inspections and comparisons are one of the very good working methods that emerged during the high tide of agricultural production in 1958, and are an inseparable part of the entire mass movement. In future rural work, this working method should continue to be used, and it should be done better and more meticulously.

    The greatest advantage of this kind of inspection and comparison lies in its broad mass character. First, this inspection is not only superior inspecting subordinates, but also superiors and subordinates jointly inspecting the work. A large inspection team often includes leaders at several levels, including responsible comrades from higher leading organs and staff from grassroots units (such as communes, management districts, and production teams). In joint inspections, the opinions of superiors and subordinates can be fully exchanged, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates will be closer, enabling the work to be promoted rapidly and powerfully. Second, this inspection is not simply cadres inspecting the masses, but leaders and the broad masses jointly inspecting. Producers are also inspectors. They inspect their own work with the attitude of masters, and they also inspect the work of others with the attitude of masters, learning from each other and promoting each other in mutual inspection.

    Precisely because this kind of inspection and comparison has a broad mass character, wherever the inspection team goes, there are always many people, high enthusiasm, and high morale. Once the inspection and comparison are launched, the center of public opinion in a place quickly concentrates on the key issues of the current work. In this way, problems are discovered quickly, and problems are solved thoroughly.

    Precisely because this kind of inspection and comparison has a broad mass character, there are many people who are familiar with policies, familiar with production, and familiar with local conditions. Therefore, in the inspection and comparison, it is easier to see the work of a place more comprehensively, more meticulously, and more correctly, and it is also easier to see the key issues in the work. It is possible to have praise, eulogy, criticism, and suggestions, and to be timely and to the point, making the inspection and comparison full of combat effectiveness and constructiveness.

    Precisely because this kind of inspection and comparison has a broad mass character, various experiences will also be disseminated more quickly during the inspection and comparison. When a place has good creations and good experiences, it will quickly attract everyone's attention. In order to promote these, on-the-spot meetings can be held quickly. Through this large-scale inspection and comparison, exchanges between various regions and various units will be closer, making it easier to encourage each other, learn from each other, and help each other.

    Since large-scale inspection and comparison have so many advantages, it is certainly worth advocating. Good weapons become sharper with use, and good working methods become more skilled with use. In the preparations for spring plowing and spring plowing itself, it is necessary to carefully organize great inspections and comparisons, and in the future, it is also necessary to organize great inspections and comparisons regularly. The specific methods of inspection and comparison must also be continuously improved and continuously enhanced. Doing so will surely push the booming production upsurge to a new peak.

    展开备耕大检查大评比
    许多地区都在组织大规模的备耕检查评比。要检查评比播种计划、生产指标，要检查评比增产措施、革命干劲，更要检查评比具体措施和物资准备、技术准备同增产指标是否适应。要一件一件地查，一项一项地比，有经验立即推广，有问题赶快解决。这种群众性的大检查大评比，无疑地将会对当前的备耕工作起很大的推动作用。
    大规模的群众性的检查评比，是在1958年农业生产高潮中出现的很好的工作方法之一，也是整个群众运动的不可分的一部分。在今后的农村工作中，应当继续运用这种工作方法，并且要做得更好、更细致。
    这种检查评比的最大优点，就在于它的广泛的群众性。首先，这种检查不仅是上级检查下级，而且上下级共同来检查工作。一个大的检查团中，常常包罗了好几级的领导人员，其中既有高级领导机关的负责同志，也有基层单位（例如公社、管理区、生产队）的工作人员。在共同检查中，上下级的意见可以充分交流，上下级的关系也会更加密切，能够迅速地有力地推动工作。其次，这种检查，也不单纯是干部检查群众，而是领导者和广大群众共同来检查。生产者同时也是检查者。他们以主人翁的态度检查自己的工作，也以主人翁的态度检查别人的工作，在互相检查中互相学习，互相促进。
    正因为这种检查评比有广泛的群众性，所以检查团所到之处，总是人多势众，热气腾腾，干劲高涨。检查评比一展开，一个地方的舆论的中心很快就集中到当前工作的关键问题上。这样，发现问题就快，解决问题也就透。
    正因为这种检查评比有广泛的群众性，熟悉政策、熟悉生产、熟悉当地情况的人都比较多，所以在检查评比中，对于一个地方的工作，就容易看得比较全面、比较细致、比较正确，也容易看到工作中的关键性的问题，可以做到有表扬，有歌颂，有批评，有建议，而且恰合时宜，切中要害，使得检查评比充满战斗性和建设性。
    正因为这种检查评比有广泛的群众性，所以在检查评比中，各种经验也会传播得更快。一个地方有了好的创造，好的经验，很快就会引起大家的注意。为了推广这些，很快就可以召开现场会议。通过这种大规模的检查评比，各个地区、各个单位之间的交往会更加密切，便于互相鼓舞、互相学习、互相帮助。
    大规模的检查评比既然有这么多的好处，当然值得大大提倡。好的武器愈用愈锋利，好的工作方法也愈用愈熟练。在备耕和春耕中，要认真地组织大检查大评比，今后还要定期地组织大检查大评比。检查和评比的具体方法，还要不断改进，不断提高。这样做，一定会把轰轰烈烈的生产高潮推向新的高峰。
