    Giving Play to the Leading Role of Teachers
    Bai Sheng

    How to give play to the leading role of teachers in teaching work under the leadership of the Party and under the principle of teaching each other, is an important issue in the current teaching work of universities. Chongqing University has paid attention to giving full play to the role of teachers in teaching work in the overall arrangement of teachers' work, which has played a good role in improving the quality of teaching.

    Teaching work, as the name implies, includes two aspects: teaching and learning. Teachers teach well, students learn well; one teaches, one learns, there is teaching and there is learning, teachers and students jointly complete the teaching task, which is the main content of school teaching work.

    In schools, young students come to "seek knowledge," and they diligently and humbly learn knowledge from teachers. The main task of teachers is to teach students well under the leadership of the Party and to the best of their ability. The so-called "patient teaching and tireless instruction" is the responsibility of teachers. In order to teach students well, teachers must go deep into the student masses, humbly listen to the opinions of students, strengthen their own studies, improve teaching work, and improve the quality of teaching. The "Record of Learning" in the "Book of Rites" says: "Only after learning do you know your deficiencies, and only after teaching do you know your difficulties. Knowing your deficiencies, then you can reflect on yourself. Knowing your difficulties, then you can strengthen yourself. Therefore, it is said: Teaching and learning grow together." This precisely illustrates the relationship of teaching and learning growing together between teachers and students. In teaching activities, teachers should play a leading role in a series of processes such as lecturing, assigning homework, grading papers, correcting homework, exams, and answering questions.

    Our education cause, the school system, teaching plans, teaching syllabus, etc. in schools, must, under the leadership of the Party, implement the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and implement the Party's mass line. Therefore, the teaching work of teachers must also be under the leadership of the Party and follow the mass line. Chongqing University, according to the expertise of teachers and the needs of school development, properly and carefully arranges the teaching and scientific research work of teachers, and actively organizes and helps teachers to go deep into practice, deep into the student masses, and strengthen the exercise of productive labor and the study of political theory. This enables teachers to better implement the Party's education policy, create new teaching methods, and establish new teacher-student relationships under the leadership of the Party and based on the principle of teaching and learning growing together, and further give play to the leading role of teachers in teaching work.

    发挥教师的主导作用
    柏生
    如何在党的领导下，在教学相长的原则下，发挥教师在教学工作中的主导作用，这是目前高等学校教学工作中的一个重要问题。重庆大学在全面安排教师工作中，注意充分发挥教师在教学工作中的作用，对提高教学质量起了很好的作用。
  教学工作，顾名思义，它包含着教与学两个方面。教师教好，学生学好；一个教，一个学，有教有学，师生共同完成教学任务，这正是学校教学工作的主要内容。
    在学校，青年学生是为“求学”而来，他们勤奋地虚心地向老师学到知识。而教师的主要任务，则是在党的领导下，尽己所长地向学生教好课。所谓“循循善诱，诲人不倦”，乃是教师的责任。教师为了教好学生，就必须深入学生群众，虚心倾听学生的意见，加强自己的进修，改进教学工作，提高教学质量。“礼记”的“学记”上所说的：“学然后知不足，教然后知困。知不足，然后能自反也。知困，然后能自强也。故曰：教学相长也。”这正说明师生间的教学相长的关系。在教学活动中，教师应该在讲课、指定作业、改卷子、改作业、考试、答疑等一系列的过程中起主导作用。
    我们的教育事业，学校中的学制、教学计划、教学大纲等等，都必须在党的领导下，贯彻党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，贯彻执行党的群众路线。因此，教师的教学工作也必须是在党的领导下，走群众路线。重庆大学根据教师的专长和学校发展的需要，妥善周详地安排了教师的教学和科学研究工作，并积极组织和帮助教师深入实际，深入学生群众，加强生产劳动的锻炼和政治理论的学习。这就能使教师在党的领导下，根据教学相长的原则，更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针，创造新的教学方法，建立新的师生关系，进一步发挥教师在教学工作中的主导作用。
