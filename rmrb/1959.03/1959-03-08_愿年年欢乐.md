Wishing Joy Every Year
Qin Xiulan

Time provides the same opportunities for everyone, yet people experience completely different circumstances and moods during the same period.

Today, women in the socialist camp are welcoming their holiday with outstanding labor achievements and the enthusiasm and drive to build the socialist motherland. At their machines, on welding rigs, in the fields, by the sides of children, behind counters, on trains, in front of hospital beds, and in all kinds of positions, they are using their nimble hands to weave bright and dazzling flowers for the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland. Soviet sisters are marching confidently towards communism while singing loudly, and the red flag they hold high is fluttering in the hearts of women all over the world.

China's more than 300 million women are creating a spring of even greater leaps forward. More than 100 million rural households' mistresses will spend the festival joyfully in the green fields. They no longer spend their days revolving around the stove, the bed, and the millstone; they no longer have to worry about their children's eating and sleeping. The People's Communes have arranged ample conditions for them to participate in the construction of the motherland, opening the door wide for them to contribute their wisdom and talents. You say, how can they not cheer, how can they not sing!

And as we immerse ourselves in this incomparable joy, how can we not gaze deeply into the distance!

Ah, we see you, our sisters in Arabia, Africa, and Latin America. Smiles of victory adorn your faces, but your eyes still hold the tears of hardship. How many years! Hoping for freedom, striving for independence, Cuban women have waited from maidenhood to white hair; black African mothers have offered prayers in vain for a lifetime. Until today, they finally stand up and laugh aloud! Today, the flames of national independence are burning in your lands. Go to the streets with the men, to witness the last days of the traitors, to break through the last dike of colonialism and imperialism! I really want to fly to your side, to sing and shout with you!

We also see you, the wife of an American worker. You are frowning, coaxing your children, who haven't had half a loaf of bread in two days, but what can you do? Your husband has been unemployed for almost a year. Last year, the Wall Street financial oligarchs took away the jobs of five million workers, bringing tears to the eyes of five million wives!

We see you, the mothers of Western Europe. Women in London are worried about the increasing burden of living, women in Paris are anxious about the devaluation of the franc, women in Bonn, your mood is always as gloomy as the haze above your heads; women in Venice, your tears are as endless as the water flowing through the streets. The fate of your countries has been strapped onto the chariot of that gold-dominated empire, galloping down a dead end. It's just like what one of our ancient poets described: "An ancient road, a west wind, a thin horse, the setting sun goes down, a heartbroken person is at the end of the world."

March 8th, you bring more joy to so many people, you bring more hope to so many people! Although there are still many sisters in the world who are spending the March 8th of 1959 in a very depressed mood. However, the sorrows of many mothers are temporary, while the sorrows of those warmongers can never be resolved. The east wind blows stronger and stronger, the days of the imperialists are getting worse and worse, this is the inevitable law of historical development, and no one can do anything about it. Let us work hard with the men to make the newborn grow fast, to make what is just born grow faster, and to make the decadent die faster! May this year's March 8th bring us more happiness, and may next year's March 8th bring more joy to all peace-loving women in the world!

    愿年年欢乐
    秦绣兰
    时节对于每个人的机会总是相同的，然而人们在相同的时节却有完全不同的境遇和心情。
    今天，社会主义阵营的妇女们，用出色的劳动成果，用建设社会主义祖国的热情和干劲来迎接自己的节日。她们在机床边，在焊接架上，在田野上，在孩子们身边，在柜台旁，在列车上，在病床前，在各种各样的岗位上，用灵巧的双手，为祖国的锦绣河山织出一朵朵鲜艳夺目的花朵。苏联的姊妹们满怀信心地高歌着迈向共产主义，她们高举着的红旗，正在全世界妇女的心头飘荡。
    中国的三亿多妇女，正在创造一个更大跃进的春天。一亿多户农家的主妇，将要在青青的原野上欢乐地度过节日。她们不再整天围着锅台、床台和磨台转了，她们不再要为娃娃的吃和睡操心了，人民公社为她们安排了参加祖国建设的充分条件，为她们贡献自己的聪明才智大开方便之门。你说，这怎能不欢呼，怎能不歌唱！
    而当我们沉浸在这种无法比拟的欢乐里的时候，我们又怎能不深情地凝望着远方！
    啊，我们望见了你阿拉伯、非洲和拉丁美洲的姊妹们。你们脸上挂着胜利的笑容，眼睛里还噙着辛酸的泪花。多少年了啊！盼望自由，争取独立，古巴的妇女从妙龄少女盼到白发苍苍；黑非洲的母亲们空做了一辈子的祷告。直到今天，终于站起来高声欢笑了！今天，民族独立的火焰，正在你们的国土上燃烧。你们跟男人们一起走上街头，去看看卖国贼的末日，去冲破殖民主义者、帝国主义者的最后一道堤防吧！我真想飞到你们身边，同你们一起唱歌，一起呐喊！
    我们也望见了你美国工人的妻子，你正紧锁双眉，哄着你的孩子们，他们两天没有啃半块面包了，可是，这有什么办法，你的丈夫失业快一年了。去年，华尔街金融寡头们夺去了五百万工人的饭碗，给五百万个妻子带来了眼泪！
    我们望见你西欧的母亲们。伦敦的妇女们为生活负担加重而发愁，巴黎的妇女们为法郎贬值焦心，波恩的妇女们，你们的心情老是像头顶上的阴霾那样低沉；威尼斯的妇女们，你们的眼泪就像街头的流水那样无穷无尽。你们的国家的命运，被那个金元帝国绑上了战车，在绝路上驱驰。真像我们一位古代诗人描写的：“古道西风瘦马，夕阳西下，断肠人在天涯。”
    三八节，你给多少人带来更多的欢乐，你给多少人带来更多的希望！虽然，在世界上仍然还有很多姊妹在渡过1959年的三八节时，心情仍然十分愁闷。但是，许多母亲们的忧愁是暂时的，而那些战争贩子们的忧愁却是永远也解不开的。东风越吹越猛，帝国主义者的日子越来越不好过，这是历史发展的必然规律，谁也不能奈何它。让我们同男人们一起努力，叫新生的快成长，叫方生的快些生，叫腐朽的快些死亡吧！愿今年的三八节给我们带来更多的幸福，愿明年的三八节为全世界爱好和平的妇女们带来更多的欢乐！
