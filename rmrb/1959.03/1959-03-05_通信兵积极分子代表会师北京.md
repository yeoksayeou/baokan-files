Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Communication Corps Activist Representatives Conference opened in Beijing today.

More than 500 representatives of advanced units and activist representatives of the Communication Corps from the Fujian Front and all over the country are participating in the conference. Wang Zheng, Director of the Communication Corps, gave a report at the opening ceremony. Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Peng Shaohui, General, also attended and spoke.

The Communication Corps is one of the modernized arms of the People's Liberation Army. In the past year, it has achieved great victories and accomplishments in combat, modernization construction, and participation in the socialist telecommunications construction of the motherland. In the battles to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen, the Communication Corps displayed a high degree of heroism and tenacity, ensuring the victory of the battle. Chen Liangen, an activist representative and second-class meritorious worker participating in the conference, connected lines more than 70 times in two hours during the fierce artillery battles on the Fujian Front, ensuring smooth communication on the battlefield. In military training, the Communication Corps troops launched the "one specialty, multiple skills" and "one soldier, multiple uses" movement.

The Communication Corps also enthusiastically participated in the construction of rural telephone networks and wired broadcasting networks. Last year alone, the Nanjing and Shenyang troops laid more than 3,400 kilometers of telephone lines for rural areas and supported communes with more than 1,000 telephone sets.
