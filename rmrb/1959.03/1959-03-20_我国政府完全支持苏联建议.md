Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. Regarding the convening of a summit conference to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue:

Our government fully supports Soviet proposals.
If Western countries reject Soviet proposals or engage in delaying tactics, socialist countries will have no choice but to seek other ways to promote a solution to the German and West Berlin issues.
If Western countries dare to resort to force, our country will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling the provocations of the aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, received Antonov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, on the 19th and handed him a reply from the Chinese government to the Soviet government's note of March 2nd regarding the proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue. The full text of the Chinese government's reply and the Soviet government's note of March 2nd are as follows:

The Reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Government Regarding the Soviet Government's Proposal to Convene a Summit Conference to Discuss the German Peace Treaty and the West Berlin Issue

The Government of the People's Republic of China is pleased to have received the note of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dated March 2nd of this year, and has learned that the Soviet government proposes to convene a highest-level meeting attended by the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, with the participation of representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet government proposes that if Western countries are not yet prepared to participate in the highest-level meeting, then a foreign ministers' meeting attended by the countries suggested above could be convened. The Government of the People's Republic of China has studied the note of the Soviet government and believes that the Soviet government's unremitting efforts to eliminate the threat of war and correctly resolve the German issue fully demonstrate its determination and sincerity in safeguarding world peace and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports this proposal of the Soviet government's.

Since the end of World War II, the Western countries, headed by the United States, have flagrantly violated the Potsdam Agreement, consistently adhered to an aggressive and war-mongering policy of splitting Germany and rearming West Germany, and have drawn West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Today, West Germany is playing a crucial role in this aggressive bloc and has become a center for conducting the Cold War and a base for launching atomic warfare. All this has not only greatly deepened the division of Germany but also seriously threatens the peace of Europe and the world. Therefore, the correct resolution of the German question is of paramount importance for ensuring world peace and the security of all peoples.

In order to promote Germany's development in a peaceful and democratic direction in accordance with the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has, for more than a decade, continuously put forward to the Western countries of the United States, Britain, and France reasonable proposals for concluding a German peace treaty, withdrawing foreign troops stationed in Germany, and many other ways of resolving the German question. The government of the German Democratic Republic has also repeatedly put forward to the West German government proposals to promote rapprochement between the two Germanys and to establish a confederation. However, all these reasonable proposals have been unreasonably rejected by Western countries. Despite this, the Soviet Union, in line with its lofty aspiration to safeguard world peace and its obligations to Germany, put forward a proposal on January 10 this year to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss and sign a German peace treaty, after proposing that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city. There is no doubt that the realization of the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic would eliminate the threat of war and promote the peaceful reunification of Germany. However, Western countries still refuse to abandon their reactionary policy on the German question. In particular, the United States has not only failed to put forward any practical and feasible proposals for resolving the German question, but has also constantly clamored for the use of force, poisoning the international atmosphere. This cannot but arouse the severe condemnation and unanimous opposition of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world.

Recently, under the pressure of just world opinion, Western countries, in order to extricate themselves from their extremely embarrassing situation, have had to make a gesture of willingness to negotiate, proposing to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, but they have predetermined the agenda of this meeting to be a discussion by the four powers of so-called "all aspects and implications of the German problem," while avoiding any mention of the signing of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. It is obvious that the purpose of Western countries in playing this extremely clumsy trick is nothing more than to deliberately complicate the negotiations in order to delay and obstruct the signing of a German peace treaty, thereby achieving the goal of permanently dividing Germany and maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin.

The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that if Western countries once again reject the Soviet government's proposal to convene a highest-level meeting of the leaders of the countries concerned or a meeting of foreign ministers, or if they use endless arguments at the meeting to delay and obstruct it, then socialist countries will have no choice but to seek other ways to promote a solution to the German and West Berlin issues. All the threats and clamors of Western countries will not achieve their goals. If they dare to attempt to resort to force and infringe upon the territory and sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, then, as the note says, "Anyone who dares to do so should bear serious responsibility before mankind for launching a new war." The People's Republic of China will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such armed provocations, and the aggressors will surely reap what they sow.

The Government of the People's Republic of China highly appreciates the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet government to safeguard world peace, and reiterates that it will continue to fully support the efforts of the Soviet government.

Beijing, March 19, 1959

The Note of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dated March 2, 1959

The Soviet Government notes with great satisfaction that the Government of the People's Republic of China, in its statement of January 21st this year regarding the Soviet Government's note of January 10th, fully supported the Soviet Government's proposal for the necessity of convening a peace conference to conclude a German peace treaty (the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Government has been endorsed by the Government of the People's Republic of China) and to eliminate the abnormal situation in Berlin caused by the continued occupation of West Berlin. At the same time, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to inform the Government of the People's Republic of China of the following matters:

The Soviet Government received on February 16th this year replies from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Government's note of January 10th to the aforementioned three governments. These notes did not respond to the Soviet Union's specific proposals, such as concluding a German peace treaty and convening a conference of countries that participated in the war against Germany for this purpose, and the proposal to normalize the situation in Berlin. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France attempted to replace the solution of these issues, which are of paramount importance for consolidating European peace and the future of the German nation, with talk of hoping that the foreign ministers of the four powers would discuss "all aspects of the German problem," and they did not put forward any substantive proposals on this issue.

The Soviet Government sent new notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on March 2nd. The Soviet Government drew the attention of the Western powers to the fact that their statements on the German issue in their replies of February 16th themselves demonstrated their unwillingness to consider the current actual situation in Germany and the requirements of reason. If, fourteen years ago, Germany, although divided into several zones, was still a country with a single social structure, then today there are two German states developing in different directions. If the Western powers truly strive to resolve the German issue on a realistic basis, they cannot close their eyes to this fact, especially since they were the first to establish the West German state. The United States, Britain, and France adopted a policy of splitting Germany at the very beginning of the occupation, and at the same time they prepared to rearm the West German state they had established. In doing so, they abandoned the Potsdam Agreement, which was intended to eradicate the ideology of German militarism, an ideology that the people of Europe had paid for with incredible sacrifices and suffering. As subsequent events have shown, their main consideration was to entice West Germany into their military bloc. The Federal Republic of Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allows it to openly begin building a Bundeswehr and demand that this Bundeswehr be armed with rocket-atomic weapons. It is precisely because of the policy of rearming and supporting West German militarist forces that the peoples of Europe must once again live in a situation of anxiety about their future.

Another independent German state - the German Democratic Republic - has chosen the path of peace and social progress for itself. There is no soil here for the restoration of militarism and the implementation of aggressive and revanchist policies. The government of the German Democratic Republic does not implement compulsory military service, nor does it build a large army. The contrast and separation between the two German states is becoming increasingly profound for the following reasons: they belong to two mutually opposed national military-political blocs, and they have assumed certain obligations by participating in these blocs.

In this way, the post-war development of Germany has raised a number of new issues that are different from those faced by the four powers in the early years after the defeat of Hitler's Germany.

The Western powers propose to discuss all aspects of the German problem, but they themselves have undermined the basis for such a discussion. The four powers' common policy towards Germany no longer exists. For example, no one can ask the Soviet Union to be responsible for the Federal Republic of Germany's path of militarist development. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has repeatedly warned the Western powers and the Federal Republic of Germany that this path of development in West Germany contains dangers to peace and the cause of German unity. On the other hand, few people would attribute the victory and consolidation of the peace-loving and democratic forces of the German Democratic Republic to the Western powers.

Today, it is still possible to restore the cooperation of the four powers on important issues related to Germany. The conclusion of a German peace treaty would open up this possibility. According to the treaty, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany would undertake the same obligations, which would be sufficient to eliminate the possibility of a revival of German militarism, thus guaranteeing conditions for the peaceful development of the two German states and freeing the peoples of Europe from the heavy threat of war.

The Soviet Government's proposal for concluding a German peace treaty has so far been fully endorsed by the governments of nine countries that once sent armed forces to participate in the war against Hitler's Germany, with a total population of approximately one billion people. This proposal has also received the endorsement and support of broad social strata in many other countries.

Isn't this a convincing fact that is conducive to illustrating that a German peace treaty should be concluded in the near future?

As for the issue of German reunification, the Soviet Government has clearly and definitely emphasized in its reply that it believes that it is impossible and impermissible to interfere in the affairs of the two German states or to have anyone replace them in resolving the issue of reunification. This issue can only, and should only, be resolved by the Germans themselves. If the four powers were to take any action in this regard without harming the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, it would be to promote the elimination of the current state of estrangement in the relationship between the two German states, to bring them closer together in order to solve the task of reunifying Germany, and to reach an agreement. The Soviet Government expresses its readiness to provide such assistance, in particular to support the German Democratic Republic Government's proposal for the establishment of a German Confederation. Naturally, we had hoped that those Western powers who profess loyalty to the cause of German reunification would show a constructive attitude towards this proposal, but so far, they have not shown such an attitude.

The Soviet Government has also pointed out that it is convinced that, under the current circumstances, the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the normalization of the situation in Berlin would themselves be the best way to resolve the reunification issue as soon as possible in accordance with the national aspirations of the German people and the interests of peace and security for the people of other countries.

According to the Soviet Government, if the countries concerned truly want to conclude a treaty, the treaty can be concluded with the two German states. Because now only they can represent the Germany that signed the surrender instrument, and the treaty should affirm the existing state of affairs. If anyone wishes to change the social system of either of these two countries through foreign interference, then he can only live in a world of illusions. Isn't it clear that any attempt to use force against the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany would lead to a conflict between the two opposing military blocs in which they participate and subject mankind to a new war that would be a hundred times more devastating in its consequences than all past wars?

The conclusion of a German peace treaty also means resolving the Berlin issue. The Soviet Government has repeatedly reminded the governments of the Western powers that the current situation in Berlin is abnormal and that it is an important source of international tension, especially tension between European countries. The Soviet Government advocates that this issue should be resolved on a basis acceptable to all parties concerned in order to achieve the goal of ensuring peace and the security of the peoples of Europe. It is for this reason that it has proposed that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city, whose autonomous status and necessary business, cultural, and other ties with Eastern and Western countries will be guaranteed by reliable international guarantees with the participation of the major powers and the United Nations.

In this situation, how should we assess the threats issued by the West? The West threatens that after the conclusion of a peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic, as the sovereign master of transport between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany, they will use tanks and planes to rush into Berlin. If there is indeed an attempt to resort to force behind these threats, then anyone who dares to do so should bear serious responsibility before mankind for launching a new war.

The Soviet Government is convinced that it is now more necessary than ever to take urgent and effective measures to prevent the situation from developing in a dangerous direction. Therefore, it has once again raised with the governments of the Western powers the issue of holding talks between the highest-level national leaders.

The foreign ministers' meeting currently proposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is a long road.

If some heads of government have not yet taken decisive decisions to establish relations between countries on the basis of cooperation and not to allow anything to happen that would complicate these relations, then can other representatives of some countries take some decisions that can guarantee that relations between countries will be fundamentally improved?

In the current tense situation, the very fact of a meeting of heads of government would undoubtedly promote the soundness of the entire international atmosphere. If the heads of government participating in the meeting decide that they will strive in the future to resolve all international problems for the sake of peace and on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and will not allow anything to happen that would hinder the achievement of these lofty goals, then not to mention how great and truly historical significance such a decision would have.

Obviously, the heads of government can discuss a wider range of issues than those that the governments of the Western powers propose to be discussed by the foreign ministers' meeting. This particularly involves those issues which, if not resolved, contain a threat to the security of the peoples of all countries and to world peace. The Soviet Government's starting point is that the heads of government will discuss its proposal for concluding a German peace treaty and its proposal for taking joint measures to eliminate the abnormal situation caused by the foreign occupation of West Berlin. Of course, the decisions agreed upon at this meeting regarding the treaty can be submitted to a peace conference, as suggested by the Soviet Union.

In addition, the heads of government meeting can also discuss issues related to ensuring European security and disarmament, such as the mutual withdrawal of troops and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and buffer zones for the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the reduction of the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in the territories of other countries, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the cessation of testing such weapons.

The Soviet Government believes that representatives of countries that suffered aggression from Hitler's Germany should also actively participate in this work. This is a necessary condition for the smooth preparation of a German peace treaty and the resolution of all issues related to ensuring European security. Therefore, the Soviet Government believes that, in addition to the four powers and the two German states participating in the meeting, it is also necessary for relevant countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, which are both neighbors of Germany and were among the earliest victims of Hitler's aggression, to participate in the meeting. As for the issue of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany participating in the meeting, the Soviet Government believes that when discussing the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue at the highest-level meeting, both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should have representatives participating in the meeting.

Some people in the West often make statements against the highest-level meeting because it is said that there is no guarantee that such a meeting will not fail. Of course, if some participants have no intention of promoting an agreement at such a meeting from the beginning, then it may indeed fail. However, in this case, any meeting, no matter at which level it is held, is inevitably doomed to failure.

In order to ensure the success of the highest-level meeting, all participants in the meeting must adhere to a sincere desire to seek an agreement and recognize that, in order to ensure lasting peace between the peoples of all countries, it is necessary to abandon attempts to seek any unilateral advantage in the negotiations.

The Soviet Government believes that the highest-level meeting has the greatest chance of achieving positive results at present. It is precisely the prestigious national leaders, such as the heads of government, who have the greatest authority and experience, who should put forward their own views in order to give a new direction to the development of relations between countries.

After the heads of government have reached an agreement on some mature international issues, the foreign ministers can be instructed to formulate further measures to implement the various common decisions that have been adopted.

If the governments of the Western powers are not yet prepared to participate in the highest-level meeting, then the Soviet Government believes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia can be convened to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet Government declares its agreement with the proposal of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that both German states - the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany - should have representatives participating in this meeting. In view of the fact that these two specific issues have long been ripe, the Soviet Government believes that it is appropriate to stipulate that the duration of the work of the foreign ministers' meeting should not exceed two or three months.

The Soviet Government suggests that the aforementioned meeting of heads of government be convened in Vienna or Geneva in April of this year, if it is convenient for the other participating countries and, of course, if the governments of Austria or Switzerland are willing to host the participants of such a meeting.

If the Western powers are not prepared for a meeting of heads of government, then the Soviet Government proposes that a meeting of foreign ministers of the countries mentioned above be convened at the above-mentioned time and place.

The Soviet Government hopes that the various proposals it has put forward in this note will be understood and supported by the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    关于召开首脑会议讨论对德和约和西柏林问题
    我国政府完全支持苏联建议
    如果西方国家拒绝苏联建议或者进行拖延阻挠，社会主义国家就不得不寻找其他办法促进德国和西柏林问题的解决。
    如果西方国家胆敢诉诸武力，我国将同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起全力支持德意志民主共和国反击侵略者的挑衅。
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国外交部副部长曾涌泉于19日接见了苏联驻华临时代办安东诺夫，并交给他一份中国政府就苏联政府3月2日给中国政府关于建议召开政府首脑会议讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题的照会的复照。中国政府复照和苏联政府3月2日来照的全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府就苏联政府建议召开首脑会议讨论对德和约和西柏林问题给苏联政府的复照
    中华人民共和国政府荣幸地收到了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府今年3月2日的来照，得悉苏联政府建议召开由苏联、美国、英国、法国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的国家领导人出席，并且有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加的最高级会议来讨论对德和约和西柏林问题。同时，苏联政府提出，如果西方国家还不准备参加最高级会议，那末，可以召开由上面所建议的各国参加的外长会议。中华人民共和国政府研究了苏联政府的照会，认为苏联政府为了消除战争威胁和正确地解决德国问题所作的不懈努力，充分证明它为维护世界和平和促进德国和平统一的决心和诚意。中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联政府的这项建议。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，以美国为首的西方国家粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，一贯坚持分裂德国和重新武装西德的侵略政策和战争政策，并且把西德拉入了北大西洋公约集团。今天，西德正在这个侵略集团中扮演重要的角色，并且成为进行冷战的中心和发动原子战争的基地。这一切，不仅大大加深了德国的分裂，而且严重地威胁着欧洲和世界的和平。因此，德国问题的正确解决对于确保世界和平和各国人民的安全就具有极其重大的意义。
    苏联为了促使德国按照波茨坦协定的基本原则朝着和平民主的方向发展，十多年来，曾经不断向美、英、法西方国家提出缔结对德和约、撤退驻在德国的外国军队和其他许多解决德国问题的合理建议。德意志民主共和国政府为了实现祖国的和平统一，也一再向西德政府提出促进两个德国的接近和建立邦联的建议。但是，所有这些合理建议，都遭到了西方国家的无理拒绝。尽管如此，苏联仍然本着它为维护世界和平的崇高愿望和对德国所承担的义务，在提出了关于使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的建议之后，今年1月10日又提出由有关国家召开和会讨论并签订对德和约的建议。毫无疑问，实现苏联和德意志民主共和国的上述各项建议，就能消除战争威胁和促进德国的和平统一。但是，西方国家，至今仍不放弃它在德国问题上的反动政策。特别是美国，在解决德国问题上不仅没有提出过任何切实可行的建议，并且不断叫嚣使用武力，毒化国际空气。这样，就不能不引起全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的严厉谴责和一致反对。
    最近，西方国家在世界公正舆论的压力下，为了摆脱他们十分狼狈的处境，不得不作出愿意谈判的姿态，提出召开苏、美、英、法四国外长会议，但是他们又将这次会议的议程预先规定为由四大国讨论所谓“德国问题的一切方面和含义”，而对签订对德和约和西柏林问题却避而不谈。显而易见，西方国家玩弄这种十分拙劣的手法，其目的无非是要把谈判故意弄得复杂化，来拖延和阻挠对德和约的签订，从而达到永远分裂德国和维持西柏林的占领制度的目的。
    中华人民共和国政府认为，如果西方国家再次拒绝苏联政府关于召开有关国家领导人最高级会议或外长会议的建议，或者在会议中用无休止的争论来进行拖延和阻挠，那末，社会主义国家就不得不寻找其他办法来促进德国和西柏林问题的解决。西方国家的一切威胁叫嚣都不会达到他们的目的。如果他们竟然企图诉诸武力，侵犯德意志民主共和国的领土和主权，那末，正如来照所说：“任何胆敢这样做的人都应当在人类面前对发动新的战争承担严重的责任。”中华人民共和国将同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起全力支持德意志民主共和国对于这种武装挑衅的反击，侵略者必将自食其果。
    中华人民共和国政府对于苏联政府为维护世界和平所作的不懈努力给与极其崇高的评价，并且再次表示它将继续全力支持苏联政府的努力。     1959年3月19日于北京
        1959年3月2日苏联外交部的来照
    苏联政府极其满意地指出，中华人民共和国政府在今年1月21日就苏联政府1月10日照会所发表的声明中完全支持了苏联政府所提出的关于必须召开和平会议来缔结对德和约（苏联政府提出的和约草案得到了中华人民共和国政府的赞同）和消除由于保持西柏林的占领状态而造成的柏林的不正常局势的建议，同时，苏联政府认为有必要通知中华人民共和国政府下列事项：
    苏联政府在今年2月16日收到了美、英、法三国政府对苏联政府今年1月10日给上述三国政府的照会的复照。这些照会没有对苏联的这样一些具体建议作出回答：如缔结对德和约，并且为此目的而召开参加对德战争的国家的和会，以及使柏林局势正常化的建议。美、英、法三国政府企图用希望由四大国外长对“德国问题的一切方面”进行讨论的言论来代替对巩固欧洲和平和德意志民族的未来具有极其重大意义的这些问题的解决，它们也没有提出任何有关这个问题的实质的建议。
    苏联政府在3月2日给美、英、法三国政府发出了新的照会。苏联政府提起西方各大国政府注意：它们在2月16日的复照中关于德国问题的提法本身就说明了它们不愿意考虑在德国目前的实际情况和理智的要求。如果说十四年以前德意志虽然被分成几个区域但还是一个具有单一社会结构的国家的话，那么今天存在着两个朝着不同方向发展的德意志国家。如果西方各大国政府确实力求在现实的基础上解决德国问题，它们就不能闭着眼睛不看这个事实，何况它们是率先建立了西德国家的。美、英、法三国在刚开始占领时就采取了分裂德国的方针，同时它们为由它们所建立的西德国家重新武装进行准备。这样，他们就抛弃了富有根除德国军国主义思想的波茨坦协定，这种思想是欧洲各国人民以难予置信的牺牲和苦难为代价而换得的。正如后来的事态所证明，他们的主要考虑是要勾引西德加入他们的军事集团。德意志联邦共和国参加了北大西洋公约组织，就可以公开着手建立国防军并且要求用火箭——原子武器来武装这支国防军，正是由于重新武装和扶植西德军国主义力量的政策，使得欧洲各国的人民不得不再度在为自己的明天焦虑不安的情境下度日。
    另一个独立的德意志国家——德意志民主共和国——为自己选择了和平和社会进步的道路。这里没有恢复军国主义和实行侵略和复仇政策的土壤。德意志民主共和国政府不实行义务兵役制，也不建立大批军队。由于下列原因使两个德意志国家之间的对比和分离状态愈来愈深刻：即它们属于相互对立的两个国家军事政治集团，并且由于参加了这两个集团而承担着一定的义务。
    这样，战后德国的发展把一些新的问题提上了议事日程，这些问题是同击溃希特勒德国后的最初几年间四大国所面临的那些问题不一样的。
    西方各大国建议讨论德国问题的一切方面，但他们自己却破坏了这种讨论的基础。四大国共同的对德国政策早已不再存在了。例如，没有人可以要求苏联对德意志联邦共和国走上军国主义的发展道路负责。大家知道，苏联曾一再警告西方各大国和德意志联邦共和国，西德这种发展道路包藏着对和平和德国统一的事业的危险。另一方面，未必有人会把德意志民主共和国爱好和平和民主的力量获得胜利和得到巩固的事实归功于西方各大国。
    今天还有可能恢复四大国在与德国有关的重要问题上的合作。对德和约的缔结就会开辟这种可能性。根据和约，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国将承担同样的义务，这些义务足以排除德国军国主义复活的可能性，这样就能保证两个德意志国家和平发展的条件，并且会使欧洲各国人民摆脱沉重的战争威胁。
    苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议到目前为止已经得到了九个曾经派遣武装力量参加反希特勒德国战争的国家的政府的完全赞同，这些国家的人口总数约达十亿人。这个建议也获得了其他许多国家广泛社会阶层的赞同和支持。
    难道这不就是有利于说明应在最近期间缔结对德和约的一些令人信服的事实吗？
    至于德国统一的问题，苏联政府在自己的答复中已经明确而肯定地着重指出，它认为在解决统一问题的时候是不可能也不容许对两个德意志国家的事务进行干涉或者由任何人来代替他们解决的。这个问题只可以，并且也只应当由德国人自己来解决。如果要不损害德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的主权的话，四大国在这方面可以采取的唯一行动就是促使消除两个德意志国家之间的关系中目前存在的疏远状态，使它们为了解决重新统一德国的任务而接近起来，并且取得协议，苏联政府表示准备给予这样的协助，特别是支持德意志民主共和国政府关于建立德意志邦联的建议。自然我们曾经期望过那些表示忠于重新统一德国的事业的西方大国对这个建议会表现出富有建设性的态度，然而，到目前为止，它们还没有表现出这种态度。
    苏联政府还曾指出，它深信在目前的情况下对德和约的缔结和柏林局势的正常化本身就会是使重新统一问题按照德国人民的民族愿望和其他各国人民的和平和安全的利益早日解决的最好方法。
    根据苏联政府的意见，如果有关国家真正是想缔结和约的话，和约是可以同两个德意志国家缔结的。因为现在只有它们能够代表曾经在投降书上签过字的德国，而和约应当肯定现存的状态。如果有人希望借助于外来的干涉来变更这两个国家中任何一个的社会制度，那末他只能生活在幻想的世界里。想要对德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国采用强力的任何企图将导致有它们参加在内的两个对立的军事集团的冲突并且使人类遭受一次就其后果来讲要比过去所有的战争惨重百倍的新战争，这一点不是很清楚吗？
    缔结对德和约也意味着解决柏林问题。苏联政府已经不止一次地提醒西方各大国政府注意，柏林目前的情况是不正常的，它是国际紧张局势，特别是欧洲各国间紧张局势的重要源泉。苏联政府主张，这个问题应当在一切有关方面都可以接受的基础上来进行解决，以便达到保障和平和欧洲各国人民安全的目的。正因为这样，它才提出了使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的建议，这个城市的自主地位以及它同东西方国家的必要的事务上的、文化上的和其他的联系将受到有各大国以及联合国参加在内的可靠的国际保证。
    在这种情况下，应当如何来估价西方发出的威胁呢？西方威胁在签订了和约作为一个主权国家的德意志民主共和国成为西柏林和德意志联邦共和国之间交通的全权主人之后它们将使用坦克和飞机冲进柏林。如果在这种威胁后面的确隐藏着想要诉诸武力的企图，那末任何胆敢这样做的人都应当在人类面前对发动新的战争承担严重的责任。
    苏联政府深信，现在比任何时候都更需要采取紧急有效的措施来防止事态向危险的方向发展。因此，它再一次向西方各大国政府提出了最高级的国家领导人进行会谈的问题。
    美、英、法三国政府目前所建议举行的外长会谈是一条漫长的道路。
    如果一些政府首脑尚未采取果断的决定，以使国家之间的关系建立在合作的基础上并且不允许发生任何会使这种关系趋于复杂的事情，那末一些国家的其他代表是否能够采取一些可以保障国家之间的关系得到根本改善的决定呢？
    在目前紧张局势的情况下，政府首脑的会晤这一事实本身就无疑会促使整个国际气氛健全起来，如果参加会议的政府首脑决定他们今后将努力为了和平的利益和在和平共处各项原则的基础上解决一切国际问题并且不允许发生任何会妨碍达到这些崇高目的的事情，则更不用说这种决定会具有多么伟大和真正历史性的意义。
    显然，政府首脑可以讨论比西方各大国政府建议由外长会议来讨论的更为广泛的各项问题。这特别涉及一些不解决就蕴藏着对各国人民的安全和世界和平的威胁的那些问题。苏联政府的出发点是，政府首脑将讨论它所提出的关于缔结对德和约的建议以及关于采取共同措施以消除由于外国占领西柏林而造成的不正常局面的建议。当然，在这个会议上就和约所商定的决议可以像苏联所建议的那样，提交和平会议。
    此外，在政府首脑会议上还可以讨论一些同保障欧洲安全、裁军有关的问题，如关于互相撤退军队并建立无原子武器区和华沙条约和北大西洋公约组织的武装力量隔离区，关于缩减苏联、美国、英国和法国在其他国家领土上的武装力量、关于禁止原子武器和氢武器和停止这种武器的试验等问题。
    苏联政府认为，遭受希特勒德国侵略的各国代表也应积极参加这项工作。这是顺利地进行对德和约的准备工作和解决同保障欧洲安全有关的各项问题的一个必要条件。因此，苏联政府认为，除了四大国和两个德意志国家参加会议外，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克这样一些既是德国的邻国而且又曾经是希特勒侵略的最早牺牲者的有关国家也有必要参加会议。至于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加会议的问题，则苏联政府认为，在最高级会议上讨论对德和约和西柏林问题时德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都应当有代表参加会议。
    西方有些人经常发表反对最高级会议的言论，因为据说无法保证这种会议不遭到失败。当然，如果某些参加者从一开始就无意促使这种会议达成协议，那末那时它确实可能遭到失败。但是，在这种情况下任何一个会议，不论它是哪一级代表举行的会议，都不可免地注定要失败的。
    为了保证最高级会议获得成功，会议的所有参加者都必须遵循谋求协议的真诚愿望，并且认识到，为了保障各国人民之间的持久和平必须放弃力求在谈判中取得任何单方面的优势的企图。
    苏联政府认为，在目前最高级会议有最大机会来获得积极的结果。正是像政府首脑这样一些拥有最大权限和经验的有威望的国家领导人应当提出自己的主张以使国家之间的关系得到一个新的发展方向。
    在政府首脑就一些业已成熟的国际问题取得协议之后，就可以责成各外长制定进一步措施来实现所通过的各项共同决定。
    如果西方各大国政府尚未准备参加最高级会议，则苏联政府认为，为了讨论对德和约和西柏林问题，可以召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克各国的外长会议。同时，苏联政府声明同意美国、英国和法国政府的建议，即两个德意志国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都有代表参加这个会议。鉴于这两个具体问题早已成熟，苏联政府认为规定外交部长会议工作的期限不超过二、三个月是适当的。
    苏联政府建议，如果会议的其他参加国认为方便的话，以及当然如果奥地利或瑞士政府愿意接待这种会议的参加者的话，于今年4月在维也纳或日内瓦召开上述政府首脑会议。
    如果西方各大国政府对政府首脑会议没有准备，则苏联政府建议在上述期间和上述地点召开上面所建议的各国参加的外长会议。
    苏联政府希望，它在本照会中所提出的各项建议将得到中华人民共和国政府方面的了解和支持。
