Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. Regarding the convening of a summit conference to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue:

Our government fully supports Soviet proposals.
If Western countries reject Soviet proposals or engage in delaying tactics, socialist countries will have no choice but to seek other ways to promote a solution to the German and West Berlin issues.
If Western countries dare to resort to force, our country will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling the provocations of the aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, received Antonov, Charg√© d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, on the 19th and handed him a reply from the Chinese government to the Soviet government's note of March 2nd regarding the proposal to convene a summit conference to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue. The full text of the Chinese government's reply and the Soviet government's note of March 2nd are as follows:

The Reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Government Regarding the Soviet Government's Proposal to Convene a Summit Conference to Discuss the German Peace Treaty and the West Berlin Issue

The Government of the People's Republic of China is pleased to have received the note of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dated March 2nd of this year, and has learned that the Soviet government proposes to convene a highest-level meeting attended by the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, with the participation of representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet government proposes that if Western countries are not yet prepared to participate in the highest-level meeting, then a foreign ministers' meeting attended by the countries suggested above could be convened. The Government of the People's Republic of China has studied the note of the Soviet government and believes that the Soviet government's unremitting efforts to eliminate the threat of war and correctly resolve the German issue fully demonstrate its determination and sincerity in safeguarding world peace and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports this proposal of the Soviet government's.

Since the end of World War II, the Western countries, headed by the United States, have flagrantly violated the Potsdam Agreement, consistently adhered to an aggressive and war-mongering policy of splitting Germany and rearming West Germany, and have drawn West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Today, West Germany is playing a crucial role in this aggressive bloc and has become a center for conducting the Cold War and a base for launching atomic warfare. All this has not only greatly deepened the division of Germany but also seriously threatens the peace of Europe and the world. Therefore, the correct resolution of the German question is of paramount importance for ensuring world peace and the security of all peoples.

In order to promote Germany's development in a peaceful and democratic direction in accordance with the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has, for more than a decade, continuously put forward to the Western countries of the United States, Britain, and France reasonable proposals for concluding a German peace treaty, withdrawing foreign troops stationed in Germany, and many other ways of resolving the German question. The government of the German Democratic Republic has also repeatedly put forward to the West German government proposals to promote rapprochement between the two Germanys and to establish a confederation. However, all these reasonable proposals have been unreasonably rejected by Western countries. Despite this, the Soviet Union, in line with its lofty aspiration to safeguard world peace and its obligations to Germany, put forward a proposal on January 10 this year to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss and sign a German peace treaty, after proposing that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city. There is no doubt that the realization of the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic would eliminate the threat of war and promote the peaceful reunification of Germany. However, Western countries still refuse to abandon their reactionary policy on the German question. In particular, the United States has not only failed to put forward any practical and feasible proposals for resolving the German question, but has also constantly clamored for the use of force, poisoning the international atmosphere. This cannot but arouse the severe condemnation and unanimous opposition of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world.

Recently, under the pressure of just world opinion, Western countries, in order to extricate themselves from their extremely embarrassing situation, have had to make a gesture of willingness to negotiate, proposing to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, but they have predetermined the agenda of this meeting to be a discussion by the four powers of so-called "all aspects and implications of the German problem," while avoiding any mention of the signing of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. It is obvious that the purpose of Western countries in playing this extremely clumsy trick is nothing more than to deliberately complicate the negotiations in order to delay and obstruct the signing of a German peace treaty, thereby achieving the goal of permanently dividing Germany and maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin.

The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that if Western countries once again reject the Soviet government's proposal to convene a highest-level meeting of the leaders of the countries concerned or a meeting of foreign ministers, or if they use endless arguments at the meeting to delay and obstruct it, then socialist countries will have no choice but to seek other ways to promote a solution to the German and West Berlin issues. All the threats and clamors of Western countries will not achieve their goals. If they dare to attempt to resort to force and infringe upon the territory and sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, then, as the note says, "Anyone who dares to do so should bear serious responsibility before mankind for launching a new war." The People's Republic of China will, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such armed provocations, and the aggressors will surely reap what they sow.

The Government of the People's Republic of China highly appreciates the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet government to safeguard world peace, and reiterates that it will continue to fully support the efforts of the Soviet government.

Beijing, March 19, 1959

The Note of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dated March 2, 1959

The Soviet Government notes with great satisfaction that the Government of the People's Republic of China, in its statement of January 21st this year regarding the Soviet Government's note of January 10th, fully supported the Soviet Government's proposal for the necessity of convening a peace conference to conclude a German peace treaty (the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Government has been endorsed by the Government of the People's Republic of China) and to eliminate the abnormal situation in Berlin caused by the continued occupation of West Berlin. At the same time, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to inform the Government of the People's Republic of China of the following matters:

The Soviet Government received on February 16th this year replies from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Government's note of January 10th to the aforementioned three governments. These notes did not respond to the Soviet Union's specific proposals, such as concluding a German peace treaty and convening a conference of countries that participated in the war against Germany for this purpose, and the proposal to normalize the situation in Berlin. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France attempted to replace the solution of these issues, which are of paramount importance for consolidating European peace and the future of the German nation, with talk of hoping that the foreign ministers of the four powers would discuss "all aspects of the German problem," and they did not put forward any substantive proposals on this issue.

The Soviet Government sent new notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on March 2nd. The Soviet Government drew the attention of the Western powers to the fact that their statements on the German issue in their replies of February 16th themselves demonstrated their unwillingness to consider the current actual situation in Germany and the requirements of reason. If, fourteen years ago, Germany, although divided into several zones, was still a country with a single social structure, then today there are two German states developing in different directions. If the Western powers truly strive to resolve the German issue on a realistic basis, they cannot close their eyes to this fact, especially since they were the first to establish the West German state. The United States, Britain, and France adopted a policy of splitting Germany at the very beginning of the occupation, and at the same time they prepared to rearm the West German state they had established. In doing so, they abandoned the Potsdam Agreement, which was intended to eradicate the ideology of German militarism, an ideology that the people of Europe had paid for with incredible sacrifices and suffering. As subsequent events have shown, their main consideration was to entice West Germany into their military bloc. The Federal Republic of Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allows it to openly begin building a Bundeswehr and demand that this Bundeswehr be armed with rocket-atomic weapons. It is precisely because of the policy of rearming and supporting West German militarist forces that the peoples of Europe must once again live in a situation of anxiety about their future.

Another independent German state - the German Democratic Republic - has chosen the path of peace and social progress for itself. There is no soil here for the restoration of militarism and the implementation of aggressive and revanchist policies. The government of the German Democratic Republic does not implement compulsory military service, nor does it build a large army. The contrast and separation between the two German states is becoming increasingly profound for the following reasons: they belong to two mutually opposed national military-political blocs, and they have assumed certain obligations by participating in these blocs.

In this way, the post-war development of Germany has raised a number of new issues that are different from those faced by the four powers in the early years after the defeat of Hitler's Germany.

The Western powers propose to discuss all aspects of the German problem, but they themselves have undermined the basis for such a discussion. The four powers' common policy towards Germany no longer exists. For example, no one can ask the Soviet Union to be responsible for the Federal Republic of Germany's path of militarist development. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has repeatedly warned the Western powers and the Federal Republic of Germany that this path of development in West Germany contains dangers to peace and the cause of German unity. On the other hand, few people would attribute the victory and consolidation of the peace-loving and democratic forces of the German Democratic Republic to the Western powers.

Today, it is still possible to restore the cooperation of the four powers on important issues related to Germany. The conclusion of a German peace treaty would open up this possibility. According to the treaty, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany would undertake the same obligations, which would be sufficient to eliminate the possibility of a revival of German militarism, thus guaranteeing conditions for the peaceful development of the two German states and freeing the peoples of Europe from the heavy threat of war.

The Soviet Government's proposal for concluding a German peace treaty has so far been fully endorsed by the governments of nine countries that once sent armed forces to participate in the war against Hitler's Germany, with a total population of approximately one billion people. This proposal has also received the endorsement and support of broad social strata in many other countries.

Isn't this a convincing fact that is conducive to illustrating that a German peace treaty should be concluded in the near future?

As for the issue of German reunification, the Soviet Government has clearly and definitely emphasized in its reply that it believes that it is impossible and impermissible to interfere in the affairs of the two German states or to have anyone replace them in resolving the issue of reunification. This issue can only, and should only, be resolved by the Germans themselves. If the four powers were to take any action in this regard without harming the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, it would be to promote the elimination of the current state of estrangement in the relationship between the two German states, to bring them closer together in order to solve the task of reunifying Germany, and to reach an agreement. The Soviet Government expresses its readiness to provide such assistance, in particular to support the German Democratic Republic Government's proposal for the establishment of a German Confederation. Naturally, we had hoped that those Western powers who profess loyalty to the cause of German reunification would show a constructive attitude towards this proposal, but so far, they have not shown such an attitude.

The Soviet Government has also pointed out that it is convinced that, under the current circumstances, the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the normalization of the situation in Berlin would themselves be the best way to resolve the reunification issue as soon as possible in accordance with the national aspirations of the German people and the interests of peace and security for the people of other countries.

According to the Soviet Government, if the countries concerned truly want to conclude a treaty, the treaty can be concluded with the two German states. Because now only they can represent the Germany that signed the surrender instrument, and the treaty should affirm the existing state of affairs. If anyone wishes to change the social system of either of these two countries through foreign interference, then he can only live in a world of illusions. Isn't it clear that any attempt to use force against the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany would lead to a conflict between the two opposing military blocs in which they participate and subject mankind to a new war that would be a hundred times more devastating in its consequences than all past wars?

The conclusion of a German peace treaty also means resolving the Berlin issue. The Soviet Government has repeatedly reminded the governments of the Western powers that the current situation in Berlin is abnormal and that it is an important source of international tension, especially tension between European countries. The Soviet Government advocates that this issue should be resolved on a basis acceptable to all parties concerned in order to achieve the goal of ensuring peace and the security of the peoples of Europe. It is for this reason that it has proposed that West Berlin become a demilitarized free city, whose autonomous status and necessary business, cultural, and other ties with Eastern and Western countries will be guaranteed by reliable international guarantees with the participation of the major powers and the United Nations.

In this situation, how should we assess the threats issued by the West? The West threatens that after the conclusion of a peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic, as the sovereign master of transport between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany, they will use tanks and planes to rush into Berlin. If there is indeed an attempt to resort to force behind these threats, then anyone who dares to do so should bear serious responsibility before mankind for launching a new war.

The Soviet Government is convinced that it is now more necessary than ever to take urgent and effective measures to prevent the situation from developing in a dangerous direction. Therefore, it has once again raised with the governments of the Western powers the issue of holding talks between the highest-level national leaders.

The foreign ministers' meeting currently proposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is a long road.

If some heads of government have not yet taken decisive decisions to establish relations between countries on the basis of cooperation and not to allow anything to happen that would complicate these relations, then can other representatives of some countries take some decisions that can guarantee that relations between countries will be fundamentally improved?

In the current tense situation, the very fact of a meeting of heads of government would undoubtedly promote the soundness of the entire international atmosphere. If the heads of government participating in the meeting decide that they will strive in the future to resolve all international problems for the sake of peace and on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and will not allow anything to happen that would hinder the achievement of these lofty goals, then not to mention how great and truly historical significance such a decision would have.

Obviously, the heads of government can discuss a wider range of issues than those that the governments of the Western powers propose to be discussed by the foreign ministers' meeting. This particularly involves those issues which, if not resolved, contain a threat to the security of the peoples of all countries and to world peace. The Soviet Government's starting point is that the heads of government will discuss its proposal for concluding a German peace treaty and its proposal for taking joint measures to eliminate the abnormal situation caused by the foreign occupation of West Berlin. Of course, the decisions agreed upon at this meeting regarding the treaty can be submitted to a peace conference, as suggested by the Soviet Union.

In addition, the heads of government meeting can also discuss issues related to ensuring European security and disarmament, such as the mutual withdrawal of troops and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and buffer zones for the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the reduction of the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in the territories of other countries, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the cessation of testing such weapons.

The Soviet Government believes that representatives of countries that suffered aggression from Hitler's Germany should also actively participate in this work. This is a necessary condition for the smooth preparation of a German peace treaty and the resolution of all issues related to ensuring European security. Therefore, the Soviet Government believes that, in addition to the four powers and the two German states participating in the meeting, it is also necessary for relevant countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, which are both neighbors of Germany and were among the earliest victims of Hitler's aggression, to participate in the meeting. As for the issue of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany participating in the meeting, the Soviet Government believes that when discussing the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue at the highest-level meeting, both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should have representatives participating in the meeting.

Some people in the West often make statements against the highest-level meeting because it is said that there is no guarantee that such a meeting will not fail. Of course, if some participants have no intention of promoting an agreement at such a meeting from the beginning, then it may indeed fail. However, in this case, any meeting, no matter at which level it is held, is inevitably doomed to failure.

In order to ensure the success of the highest-level meeting, all participants in the meeting must adhere to a sincere desire to seek an agreement and recognize that, in order to ensure lasting peace between the peoples of all countries, it is necessary to abandon attempts to seek any unilateral advantage in the negotiations.

The Soviet Government believes that the highest-level meeting has the greatest chance of achieving positive results at present. It is precisely the prestigious national leaders, such as the heads of government, who have the greatest authority and experience, who should put forward their own views in order to give a new direction to the development of relations between countries.

After the heads of government have reached an agreement on some mature international issues, the foreign ministers can be instructed to formulate further measures to implement the various common decisions that have been adopted.

If the governments of the Western powers are not yet prepared to participate in the highest-level meeting, then the Soviet Government believes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia can be convened to discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet Government declares its agreement with the proposal of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that both German states - the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany - should have representatives participating in this meeting. In view of the fact that these two specific issues have long been ripe, the Soviet Government believes that it is appropriate to stipulate that the duration of the work of the foreign ministers' meeting should not exceed two or three months.

The Soviet Government suggests that the aforementioned meeting of heads of government be convened in Vienna or Geneva in April of this year, if it is convenient for the other participating countries and, of course, if the governments of Austria or Switzerland are willing to host the participants of such a meeting.

If the Western powers are not prepared for a meeting of heads of government, then the Soviet Government proposes that a meeting of foreign ministers of the countries mentioned above be convened at the above-mentioned time and place.

The Soviet Government hopes that the various proposals it has put forward in this note will be understood and supported by the Government of the People's Republic of China.
