Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22nd: The Eighth All-Soviet Mendeleev Congress on General and Applied Chemistry, which began in Moscow on March 16, closed on March 21. A series of major scientific research achievements were announced during the meeting, fully demonstrating the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of chemistry.

　　The convening of this congress was to discuss the tasks put forward by the Central Plenary Session of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in May last year and the Twenty-First Congress this year in the field of chemistry, and to further accelerate the development of various chemical sectors through extensive exchange of experience.

　　Chemists from nineteen countries attended the congress, including those from the United States, Britain, and Japan, in addition to socialist countries. The Chinese representatives invited to attend the congress were Yang Shixian, Chairman of the Chinese Chemical Society, and Liu Dagang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

　　During the meeting, seventeen groups were divided according to various professional departments to conduct extensive discussions for six days.

　　Many famous Soviet chemists reported their research results and new discoveries at the congress and group meetings. The famous physical chemist, Nobel Prize winner, and founder of the theory of chemical chain reactions, Semyonov, announced his new theory on the performance of free radical reactions. This theory solved the most important problem in chemistry for the first time—determining the relationship between the reactive properties of chemical substances and their structure. It opens up broad prospects for controlling chemical reactions in industry. This theory is considered one of the most important events of the congress.

　　Academician Engelgard of the Soviet Academy of Sciences introduced the new achievements of Soviet chemists in studying the laws of important physiological processes. He said that Soviet chemists had for the first time isolated nucleic acid molecules from the cell nucleus. Because nucleic acids are the basis for producing living proteins and are closely related to biological heredity, the achievements of Soviet scientists in this area have brought the secret of the genetic mechanism, the most important issue in biology, to the stage of being revealed.

　　In addition, scientists in the fields of agricultural chemistry, polymer chemistry, fuel chemistry, radiochemistry and isotope chemistry, metal chemistry, and the economics, planning, and organization of chemical production have successively announced their important discoveries or research results at the meeting. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, also made a report at the congress entitled "Mendeleev's Periodic System and Organic Chemistry." Liu Dagang also introduced China's achievements in the study of rare element ores. In six days, the meeting heard a total of more than 1,400 academic reports and speeches, fully demonstrating the brilliant achievements and grand prospects of the Soviet Union in all aspects of the field of chemistry.

    加速化学工业进一步发展
    全苏第八届化学大会闭幕
    大会显示了苏联在化学领域中的优异成就
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：从3月16日开始在莫斯科举行的全苏第八届普通化学及应用化学门捷列夫大会已于21日闭幕，会议期间宣布了一系列重大的科学研究成果，大会充分显示了苏联在化学领域中的优异成就。
    这次大会的召开是为了讨论苏联共产党去年5月中央全会及今年二十一次代表大会在化学方面所提出的任务，以及通过广泛交流经验以进一步加速化学各部门的发展。
    有十九个国家的化学家出席了这次大会，除了社会主义国家以外，还有美国、英国、日本等国的化学家。中国应邀出席大会的代表是，中国化学学会理事长杨石先和中国科学院化学研究所副所长柳大纲。
    会议期间，按照各专业部门分为十七个小组分别进行了为时六天的广泛讨论。
    很多苏联著名的化学家在大会和小组会上报告了他们的研究成果和新发现。著名的物理化学家，诺贝尔奖金获得者、化学链式反应理论的创立人谢苗诺夫宣布了他所创立的关于游离基反应性能的新理论，这一理论第一次解决了化学中最重要的问题——确定化学物质的反应性能和它们的结构之间的相互关系问题。它为在工业中控制化学反应开辟了远大的前景。这一理论被认为是这次大会最重要事件之一。
    苏联科学院院士恩格尔加德介绍了苏联化学家在研究重要生理过程的规律方面的新成就，他说，苏联化学家已经第一次从细胞核中分离出了核酸分子。因为核酸是产生活蛋白质的基础并对生物遗传有密切关系，所以苏联科学家在这方面的成就已经使遗传机制的秘密这个生物学中最重要的问题临到了即将被揭开的阶段。
    此外，在农业化学、高聚物化学、燃料化学、放射化学及同位素化学、金属化学和化学生产的经济、计划及组织等方面的科学家都先后在会上宣布了他们的重要发现或研究成果，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫也在大会上作了题为“门捷列夫元素周期系统与有机化学的报告。柳大纲也介绍了中国在研究稀有元素矿石方面的成就。在六天中，会议总共听取了一千四百多次学术报告和发言，充分显示了苏联在化学领域的各个方面所取得的辉煌成果及其宏伟的远景。
