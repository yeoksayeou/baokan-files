Since construction began in Hong'an's tobacco treasure land, three sounds have been most captivating: besides the majestic and rhythmic chants of the tampers, and the resolute and piercing cries of the dozens of earth-hauling carts, there's the heartfelt "he-ho" shouted at the peak of the labor competition. It originates from the bottom of the lungs, a resonant, sonorous, and rounded sound. Rising and falling, continuous, it's like a roaring wave, echoing throughout the valley and sky. The laborers sing of it thus:

	“He-ho” a burst,
	Full of energy;
	I'll fill up the East Sea,
	And level Mount Tai!

Speaking of "he-ho," the people of Hong'an will tell you with pride: "It's our local specialty, he!" A revolutionary elder, Wang Zexiao, even told me a story about "he-ho":

In 1927, the Party led the Volunteer Army in its first attack on Huang'an City. The Volunteer Army was composed of poor peasants from the Qili, Ziyun, and Chengguan districts, possessing only two or three old rifles. On the twenty-third day of the tenth lunar month, before dawn, hundreds of Volunteer Army soldiers, armed with pitchforks, spears, and carrying large and small red flags, shouted "He-ho, -- He-ho" in unison, advancing like a tide towards the county seat. This frightened the reactionary guards, who, hearing the surging voices, couldn't figure out how many Red Army soldiers were coming or how many firearms we possessed. They abandoned their weapons and horses and fled. The Volunteer Army quickly entered the city, and the then puppet county magistrate, He Shouchong, who didn't have time to escape, was captured alive...

Since then, I began to pay attention to the time, place, and conditions of the "he-ho's" appearance, and to understand the issues that the "he-ho" illustrates. I came to the realization that in the past, it was the bugle call of awakened peasants charging against the enemy; today, it is the signal of a people who have stood up, a declaration of high spirits, a challenge to battle, and a triumphant song of victory! In the past and present, it is the unrestrained expression of the stubbornness, courage, heroism, and optimism of the people of Hong'an!

Recently, I also discovered a new phenomenon: whenever teams of young women form cart or shoulder-pole teams on the construction site, the laborers almost unanimously "he-ho" in unison. And they? Generous and open, with smiling rosy cheeks, they raise their heads and also shout "he-ho" loudly. At this time, the entire construction site boils over, the carts run as fast as arrows, and the loads on the shoulder poles tremble with even more vigor... I think: doesn't this "he-ho" also contain a pure spirit of mutual admiration, encouragement, and romanticism?

In this sea of laborers, they are organized into regiments, battalions, and companies according to communes, brigades, and production teams, living a collectivized, militant, militarized, and democratized life. When asked about the significance of building the reservoir, the laborers can all list several points: irrigation, power generation, flood control, fish farming... Perhaps it is for this reason that they are full of energy all day long, shouting "he-ho" constantly. If judged by the standard of carrying and digging by hand, their work efficiency is not low. But in the face of this large-scale project and tight schedule, this efficiency seems insufficient. Take the main dam, for example, it requires 1.12 million cubic meters of earth, and only a little over 100,000 cubic meters have been completed. The dam must be completed before the Qingming Festival, otherwise, if mountain torrents erupt, the project will be in vain. The Engineering Section calculated that if the current method continues, 1.12 million cubic meters of earth would require 4.4 million standard workdays, meaning more than 80,000 people would have to work every day to keep the dam ahead of the spring floods. However, the County Party Committee, considering the overall situation of the county, decided that no more than 20,000 laborers could be sent to Yanbaodi. What to do? Only by improving tools and innovating technology.

The Party Committee Secretary announced to everyone: The command headquarters has decided to lay 9,000 meters of light railway tracks on the construction site, using three trucks to pull eighty cars. The plan is for each car to carry 2,000 catties, and one truck to pull twenty or so cars per trip, which is about 50,000 catties, equivalent to five or six hundred people carrying it in one trip. If these measures can be implemented, there will be no problem completing the task on schedule. But it requires more than 200 tons of iron for the railway tracks and iron wheels. Where will it come from? The Secretary said: The communes have promised to take it on.

Four days later, I went to the command headquarters on business and found a pile of greyish-black things in the left corner of the door. I walked closer out of curiosity and saw that they were brand new small railway tracks! Each three feet long. I tapped them lightly with my finger, and they rang crisply. Even more surprising was that on the flat ground outside the door, more than a zhang of small railway track had been laid, with a brand new automatic earth-dumping car placed on it. Ah! "How could it come so quickly in just four days?"...

"Isn't this the result of vigorously developing the iron and steel industry!" The more I thought about it, the more sense it made: "Without the whole Party and all the people engaging in iron and steel production, where would the communes get these two hundred tons? Without the whole Party and all the people engaging in iron and steel production, how could the communes design and sand cast it? Without the whole Party and all the people engaging in iron and steel production, where would this steel-like belief in self-reliance come from?" Because, just five months ago, Hong'an had never even smelted iron, let alone before liberation, when there wasn't a single factory in the entire county! I also thought: Without communization, where would all of this come from?

### “呵嗬”响彻烟宝地

    “呵嗬”响彻烟宝地
    谢平仄
    开工以来，在红安烟宝地有三种声音最引人入神：除了那打夯时雄伟而有节奏的号子；除了那几十路土车群发出的坚韧而锐利的叫声；就要算劳动竞赛高潮中，人们放声高呼的“呵嗬”，它出自肺腑，声音宏亮、高亢而圆润，它此起彼伏，连延不断，有如万丈波涛在咆哮，响彻整个山谷和天空。民工们这样歌唱着它：
      “呵嗬”一阵，
    浑身是劲；
    东海我来填满，
    泰山我要削平！
    提起“呵嗬”，红安人会以自豪的口吻告诉你：“这是我们的土特产呵！”一位革命老人王泽孝，还给我讲过一段关于“呵嗬”的故事：
    1927年，党领导义勇军第一次攻打黄安城。义勇军都是七里、紫云和城关几个区的贫苦农民，连撇子枪只有两三架。农历十月二十三日，天还没有发白，数百名义勇军就手执脚鱼杈、梭镖和扁担，扛起大大小小的红旗，大声地“呵嗬，——呵嗬”着，前呼后应，潮水般地向县城进发。这下可把反动派的警备队吓坏了，他们只听得人声潮涌，摸不清来了多少红军，不知道我们拥有多少枪枝弹药，一个个丢枪弃马逃之夭夭。义勇军很快打进了城，当时的伪县知事贺守中没有来得及逃跑，就被活捉了……。
    从此，我开始注意这“呵嗬”出现的时间、地点和条件，体会这
  “呵嗬”说明的问题。得出了这样的认识：在往日，它是觉醒了的农民向敌人冲锋陷阵的号角；在今天，它是站起来了的人民、干劲冲天的信号、挑战应战的战表、丰收胜利的凯歌！在过去和现在，它都是红安人民倔强、勇敢、豪迈和乐观主义的奔放！
    最近，我还发现了一种新现象，每当工地出现了年轻姑娘们组成的车子队、担子队，民工们就几乎不约而同地“呵嗬”起来，她们呢？大方、开朗，笑着红润的双颊，昂起头，也跟着高声“呵嗬”。这时，整个工地沸腾了，车子跑得快似箭、担子颤得更有劲……。我想：这“呵嗬”不也蕴藏着一股纯朴的互相爱慕、鼓舞和浪漫主义精神？
    在这民工的大海里，他们都是按照公社、大队、生产队组成团、营、连，过着集体化、战斗化、军事化、民主化的生活。问起修水库的意义，民工们都能说出几条：灌溉、发电、防汛、养鱼……正是这原因吧，他们成天劲头十足，“呵嗬”连声。要是以肩挑手挖的水平来要求，他们的工效是不低的。但是在这工程大、时间紧迫的面前，这样工效就显得不够了。拿主要的工程大坝来说，它需要土方一百一十二万，现在只完成了十万多方，而大坝必须在清明以前修成，不然山洪爆发，工程将前功尽弃。工务科算了一笔帐，如果照现在的办法，一百一十二万土方需要四百四十万个标工，即每天要有八万多人上工，才能使大坝跑在春汛之前。而县委考虑了全县的情况，决定上烟宝地的民工不能多于两万。怎么办呢？只有改良工具、革新技术。
    党委书记向大家宣布：指挥部决定在工地铺设轻便铁轨九千公尺，用三部汽车拉八十个车皮，计划每个车皮载重两千斤，一部汽车一趟拉二十几个车皮，就是五万斤左右，相当于五、六百人用肩挑跑一趟。如果这些措施都能实现，如期完成任务就没有问题了。但需要铁轨和铁轮子两百多吨铁，从哪里来呢？书记说：各公社答应包下来了。
    四天之后，我因事去指挥部，发现门的左角里堆了一堆灰黑色的东西，我好奇地走近瞧瞧，原来是全新的小铁轨！每根三尺长。我用指头轻轻敲了几下，铿锵有声。更使我惊奇的是门外平地上，铺了丈多长的小铁轨，上面还搁了一辆崭新的自动卸土车厢。啊！“前后不过四天，怎来的这快？”……。
  “难道不是大办钢铁的结果！”我越想越有道理：“如果没有全党全民办钢铁，公社哪来这两百吨？如果没有全党全民办钢铁，公社怎能设计和翻砂？如果没有全党全民办钢铁，哪来这钢铁般的自力更生的信念？”因为，就在五个月前，红安还不曾炼铁，更不用说解放前，全县一个工厂也没有！我还想：如果没有公社化，又哪来这一切？
