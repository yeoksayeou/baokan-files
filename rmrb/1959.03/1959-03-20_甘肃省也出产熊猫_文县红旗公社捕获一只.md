Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 18th – The Qiangqu Production Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Wenxian County, Gansu Province, recently captured a small panda while hunting in the deep mountains using an encirclement method. This small panda is female, only three months old, weighs fifteen pounds, and is entirely white except for black fur around its eyes, ears, neck, and rump. The Wenxian County Grain Purchasing and Marketing Station has assigned a special person to raise the small panda, and it is doing well. Pandas are a precious animal and were previously only found in Sichuan. This capture in Wenxian proves that Gansu is also a panda-producing area.

    甘肃省也出产熊猫
    文县红旗公社捕获一只
    新华社兰州18日电　甘肃省文县红旗人民公社强曲生产大队最近在深山打猎时，用围剿方法捕获一头小熊猫。这头小熊猫雌性，出生才三个月，体重十五斤，全身白色，只有眼圈、耳朵、脖子和座部有一圈黑毛。现在这头小熊猫已由文县粮食购销站派专人饲养，生活得很好。熊猫是一种珍贵动物，过去只有四川有。这次在文县捕获，证明甘肃也是熊猫出产地之一。
