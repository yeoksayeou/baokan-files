Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi blatantly distorted the Japanese Constitution in the Diet on the 17th, supporting the US military's actions of bringing nuclear weapons into Japan.

At a meeting of the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee, Socialist Party member Tsuyoshi Kihara questioned Nobusuke Kishi, saying: According to the current US-Japan "Security Treaty," the US military can bring atomic and hydrogen bombs into Japan. However, according to the government's interpretation of the Constitution, Japan possessing atomic and hydrogen bombs violates the Constitution. Therefore, the relevant part of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" violates the Constitution. According to the principle that the Constitution is the fundamental law, this part of the "Security Treaty" should be invalid.

In his response, Nobusuke Kishi did not hesitate to distort the spirit of the Japanese Constitution, trying his best to explain that Article 9 of the Constitution, which prohibits Japan from possessing war potential, "has nothing to do with the US military," and that the stationing of US troops in Japan "does not violate the Constitution." He also said that the Japanese Constitution "cannot restrict" the equipment of the US military stationed in Japan.

Prior to this, Nobusuke Kishi openly declared at a Diet meeting on the 12th that Japan possessing nuclear weapons "does not violate the Constitution."

Answering questions from Socialist Party member Tsuyoshi Suzuki at a meeting of the Senate Budget Committee, Nobusuke Kishi also said: "There are two issues regarding nuclear weapons: one is how to interpret the provisions of the Constitution, and the other is the practical and political aspects." He deliberately distorted and interpreted the provisions of the Japanese Constitution, saying that his past announcement that his cabinet would not allow Japan to conduct nuclear armament "does not mean that, according to the Constitution, Japan cannot possess anything with the name 'nuclear weapon'."

Socialist Party member Tsuyoshi Suzuki pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's interpretation of the Constitution, saying that nuclear weapons can be brought into Japan, is disturbing and dangerous.

    岸信介侵略凶相再次毕露支持美国核武器运进日本
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介17日在国会里公然歪曲日本宪法，支持美军把核武器运进日本的行为。
    社会党议员木原津与志在众议院内阁委员会会议上质问岸信介说：按照现行日美“安全条约”，美军能够把原子弹和氢弹运进日本。但是，按照政府对宪法的解释，日本拥有原子弹和氢弹是违反宪法的。因而，日美“安全条约”中的有关这一部分是违反宪法的，按照宪法是根本大法的原则，“安全条约”的这一部分应当是无效的。
    岸信介回答时不惜歪曲日本宪法精神，竭力说明规定禁止日本保有战争力量的宪法第九条“和美军无关”，美国军队驻扎在日本“不违反宪法”。他还说日本宪法“不能限制”驻日美军的装备。
    在此以前，岸信介12日在国会会议上竟公然宣称日本拥有核武器并“不违反宪法”。
    岸信介在参议院预算委员会会议上答复社会党议员铃木强的质询时还说：“关于核武器存在着两个问题：一个是宪法的规定怎样解释的问题，另一个是实际方面和政治方面的问题。”他故意歪曲解释日本宪法的条款说，他过去宣布他的内阁将不使日本进行核武装，“并不等于说，根据宪法的规定，日本不能拥有任何有‘核武器’名称的东西。”
    社会党议员铃木强指出，岸信介政府对宪法做出这样的解释，说可以把核武器运进日本，这一点令人感到不安，并且存在着危险。
