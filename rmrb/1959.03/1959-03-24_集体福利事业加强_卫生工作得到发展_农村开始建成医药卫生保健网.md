Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Under the leadership of the Party, people's communes in various parts of our country have strengthened medical and health work within the communes. A medical and health care network centered on the commune has begun to be established.

After the people's communes were established in the vast rural areas of our country, health work has also been valued and developed with the strengthening of collective welfare undertakings. Many rural hospitals originally run by counties have been transferred to the communes. The commune Party committees have also organized local medical and health forces, uniformly allocating them, and rationally distributing them, establishing commune hospitals and branch hospitals and health clinics in large and medium sized production teams. In many communes, the Party secretary, the head of the commune, and the production team leader concurrently serve as the hospital director. According to statistics up to the end of 1958, the number of rural hospitals in our country reached 39,134, and there were more than 130,000 rural maternity hospitals. There were more than 520,000 professional medical and health personnel in these hospitals and maternity hospitals. In addition, there are many medical and health care clinics and thousands upon thousands of non-fulltime or part-time health workers and midwives, forming a medical and health care network centered on the people's commune, fundamentally changing the situation in our country's rural areas where some places extremely lacked medical personnel and the distribution of medical points was extremely uneven.

The establishment of the commune health network has brought great convenience to farmers in seeing doctors, enabling health work to further cooperate with production and serve production. Last year, Ningyuan County, Hengyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, established 15 commune health centers, basically achieving the goal of having doctors and medicine in every commune team, so that the treatment of general diseases could be done without leaving the village. In order to deliver medical treatment and medicine to people's doors, many commune hospitals and health clinics have implemented a mobile medical service system. In addition to fixed outpatient clinics every day, they also carry health kits and diligently go deep into farmers' homes to provide medical treatment, which has been warmly praised by the masses. Due to the development of the rural medical network and the appropriate care from the communes, the financial burden on the masses for medical expenses has also been greatly reduced.

At present, in order to further implement the health policy of focusing on prevention, communes in various places are vigorously training cooks, health workers, childcare workers, and midwives, teaching them relevant health knowledge, and having them manage collective health work, which has a great impact on ensuring production, improving people's lives, and promoting public hygiene. After studying, many cooks have maintained the constant cleanliness of cooking utensils, eating utensils, stoves, and dining halls, wearing masks and work clothes when entering the kitchen. The cooks themselves also paid attention to personal hygiene such as frequently changing clothes and regularly trimming their nails. At the same time, the communes also organized medical personnel to strengthen health guidance for canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. The Weixing People's Commune in Tunliu Town, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, organized medical personnel to adopt the method of "one person assigned to one stove, one person assigned to one point," implementing contracted responsibility by area, using points to drive the whole area, helping canteens improve their hygiene work, so that basically all ninety-four canteens in the commune became first- and second-class canteens, which has greatly helped ensure the health of the farmers.

Eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene are basic measures for doing a good job in the collective prevention of diseases. This year, communes in various places closely cooperated with agricultural production and launched a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating pests and diseases. Under the unified leadership of the commune, medical personnel have taken on the technical guidance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in the commune. They led the masses to cooperate with accumulating fertilizer and improving environmental sanitation, clearing garbage and dirt, eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, and fumigating mosquitoes and flies overwintering. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces and cities, including Beijing, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, more than 40 million rats and more than 24 million sparrows have been killed since January this year, achieving great results.

    集体福利事业加强　卫生工作得到发展
    农村开始建成医药卫生保健网
    新华社23日电　我国各地人民公社在党的领导下，加强了公社内部的医疗卫生工作。一个以公社为中心的医药卫生保健网开始建成。
    我国广大农村人民公社化以后，随着集体福利事业的加强，卫生工作也得到重视和发展。许多原来县办的农村医院下放给公社。公社党委也将当地医药卫生力量组织起来，统一调配，合理分布，在公社建立了公社医院，大队、中队设分医院、卫生所。许多公社由党委书记、社长、生产队长兼任医院院长。据截至1958年底统计，我国乡村医院数已达三万九千一百三十四所，乡村产院十三万多所，在这些医院、产院中的专业医药卫生人员共有五十二万余人。此外，还有许多医疗保健所和成千上万的不脱产或半脱产的保健员、接生员，构成了以人民公社为中心的医药卫生保健网，根本改变了我国农村过去有的地方极端缺乏医务人员和医疗点分布极不平衡的状况。
    公社卫生网的建立，给农民看病带来了很大便利，使卫生工作能够进一步配合生产、为生产服务。湖南省衡阳专区宁远县去年建立了十五所公社卫生院，基本上做到每个社队有医有药，治疗一般疾病可以不出村。为了送医送药上门，许多公社医院、卫生所实行了巡回医疗制度，每天除了固定门诊外，还携带保健箱辛勤地深入到农民家中巡回治病，受到了群众的热烈赞扬。由于农村医疗网的发展和公社的适当照顾，群众对医疗费的负担也大大减轻了。
    目前，各地公社为了进一步贯彻执行以预防为主的卫生工作方针，都对炊事员、保健员、保育员、接生员大力进行培训，教给他们有关的卫生常识，通过他们管理好集体卫生工作，这对保证生产、改善群众生活和推动群众讲卫生也有很大影响。许多炊事员经过学习后，做到保持炊具、食具、灶台、饭厅的经常清洁，进厨房带上口罩、穿工作服，炊事员自己也注意了勤换衣、常剪指甲等个人卫生。同时，公社还组织医务人员加强对食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等的卫生指导。山西省长治市屯留镇卫星人民公社组织医务人员采取“每人分一灶、每人分一点”的办法，实行分片包干，以点带面，帮助食堂改进卫生工作，使全社九十四个食堂基本上都成为一、二类食堂，对保证农民们的健康有很大作用。
    除四害、讲卫生是做好集体预防疾病的基本措施。今年，各地公社密切配合农业生产，展开了以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动。在公社的统一领导下，医务人员担负起公社中除四害、讲卫生的技术指导工作，他们带动群众配合积肥搞好环境卫生，清除垃圾污物、铲除蚊蝇孳生场所、烟熏过冬蚊蝇等。仅据北京、江苏、浙江等十二省市的不完全统计，今年1月以来共灭鼠四千多万只，灭雀二千四百多万只，成绩很大。（附图片）
