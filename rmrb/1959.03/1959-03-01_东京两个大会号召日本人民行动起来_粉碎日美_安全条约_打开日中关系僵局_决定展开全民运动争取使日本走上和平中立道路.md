Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Tokyo: The "Abolish the Security Treaty and Promote Peaceful Coexistence Peace Conference" in Japan today passed a declaration and resolution, expressing its determination to fight for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the realization of peace and neutrality, and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The conference declaration pointed out that Japan is currently at a crossroads determining its future direction: one is the path of moving towards nuclear war with the United States by revising the "Security Treaty," and the other is the path of neutrality and peaceful coexistence. The declaration stated that all participants unanimously confirmed that all roots of Japan's implementation of militarization, nuclear armament, and anti-democratic policies lie in the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty." The declaration said that for the sake of Japan's security and Asian peace, we are determined to launch a nationwide large-scale movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and will cooperate with peace-loving people around the world to advance side by side for the complete elimination of "power politics" from Japan and the complete abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The declaration pointed out that this struggle is to build a bright Japan of neutrality and peaceful coexistence, and to bring lasting peace to Japan.

The conference unanimously passed a resolution on demanding the cessation of negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty." The resolution pointed out that if the Japanese and U.S. governments are allowed to revise the "Security Treaty," the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" and the U.S. military will openly and on a large scale conduct joint operations, Japan will send troops abroad, the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will accelerate nuclear armament, and the U.S. military will accelerate the establishment of missile bases in Japan.

The resolution said: The "Security Treaty" issue is a major issue concerning the fate of the Japanese nation. Therefore, we resolutely make the following demands to the government: immediately stop negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty," make public the content of past talks, and abolish this treaty.

The resolution calls on the Japanese government to implement a policy of peace and neutrality.

The conference also passed a letter of demands from the Japanese people to the U.S. government. The letter of demands, in the name of the Japan Peace Conference, demanded that the U.S. government: immediately withdraw its nuclear-armed troops and all other troops from the entire Asian region, including Japan; agree to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"; revise the San Francisco Treaty, and return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan; thereby seriously guaranteeing Japan's true independence and Asian peace.

The letter of demands said that the Japanese people will not allow the U.S. conspiracy to make Asians fight Asians to succeed, and the Japanese people resolutely demand to take the path of neutrality.

The letter of demands strongly condemned the United States for sending troops to invade the Middle East and occupy Chinese territory Taiwan.

The letter of demands pointed out that if the U.S. military stops infringing on the rights of other nations and withdraws from Asia, Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan will return to normal, and the root causes of Asian tensions and disputes will also be eliminated.

The letter of demands said that the participants of the Peace Conference, based on the above position and considering the historical fact that the Japanese people have suffered from two atomic bomb explosions, demand that the United States agree to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific Asian region.

The letter of demands demanded that the United States permanently stop conducting nuclear tests, stop the Cold War, and recognize the principle of peaceful coexistence.

The conference also passed resolutions on demanding that the Geneva Conference immediately reach an agreement on concluding a permanent treaty banning nuclear weapons testing, on urging the Japanese Diet to pass laws prohibiting Japan from engaging in nuclear armament and urging the Kishi Nobusuke government to take measures not to implement nuclear armament, on launching a struggle to recover Okinawa Island, on promoting the conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, on promoting the realization of the repatriation of pro-North Korean residents in Japan, on condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal compensation to South Vietnam, on protesting the South Vietnamese government's massive massacre of political prisoners, and on opposing the "performance rating" system.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Tokyo: 27,000 Tokyo citizens held a rally this afternoon demanding the crushing of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. This conference was jointly convened by more than 40 organizations from all walks of life under the joint initiative of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution of Japan, the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Preservation of Peace and Democracy.

Representatives of people from all walks of life in Tokyo, including workers, farmers, citizens, youth, students, women, and business people, participated in the conference.

Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution of Japan, Mosaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Socialist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Communist Party, Akira Imamura, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and others spoke at the conference. They unanimously pointed out that abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are goals that must be achieved for Japan's peace and prosperity.

Imamura said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with more than 3 million members, will unite with the All-Japan Trade Union Conference and the National Federation of Industrial Organizations at this decisive moment and stand at the forefront of the entire nation to carry out a resolute struggle.

In his speech, Nosaka Sanzo pointed out that Japan is currently standing at a crossroads of whether to take the path of nuclear war or the path of peace. He called on all participants to take immediate action to crush the conspiracy of the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The conference passed a resolution amid warm applause. The resolution pointed out that the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Security Treaty" means that Japan will openly participate in the U.S.-Japan "joint defense" system, send troops overseas, and allow the import of U.S. nuclear weapons, leading Japan down the path of nuclear armament. The resolution pointed out that it is obvious that as a result, it will be impossible to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations cannot be expected.

The resolution said that all participants will learn from the experience of last year's struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," unite with people from all walks of life, and strive to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The conference issued a declaration. The declaration called on all people to launch a resolute struggle from today to crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system and open the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. (Attached picture)

    大会宣言指出，日本目前站在决定将来方向的十字路口：一条是通过修改“安全条约”同美国一起走向核战争的道路，另一条是中立、和平共处的道路。宣言说，全体与会者一致确认，日本实行军国主义化、核武装化和采取反民主政策等一切根源都在于修改“安全条约”的阴谋。宣言说，为了日本的安全和亚洲和平，我们决心展开阻止修改“安全条约”的全民性大规模运动，并且将同世界上爱好和平的人民进行合作，为从日本全面排除“实力政策”和完全废除日美“安全条约”而并肩前进。宣言指出，这种奋斗是为了建立中立、和平共处的光明的日本，是为了给日本带来持久和平。
    大会一致通过了关于要求停止举行修改“安全条约”谈判的决议。决议指出，如果容许日美政府修改“安全条约”，日本“自卫队”同美军将公然而大规模地进行共同作战，日本将向国外派兵，日本“自卫队”将加紧进行核武装，美军将加紧在日本设置导弹基地。
    决议说：“安全条约”的问题是有关决定日本民族命运的重大问题。因此，我们坚决向政府提出下列要求：立即停止修改“安全条约”的谈判，把过去的会谈内容都公开出来，废除这项条约。
    决议要求日本政府实行和平中立的政策。
    大会还通过了日本人民对美国政府的要求书。要求书以日本和平大会名义要求美国政府：立即从包括日本在内的全亚洲地区撤出它的核武装军队和其他一切军队；同意废除日美“安全条约”；修改旧金山和约，把冲绳和小笠原归还日本；从而严肃保障日本的真正独立和亚洲和平。
    要求书说，日本人民不许美国使亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋得逞，日本人民坚决要求走中立的道路。
    要求书强烈谴责美国派兵侵略中东和侵占中国领土台湾的行为。
    要求书指出，如果美国军队停止侵犯其他民族权利，撤出亚洲，朝鲜、越南和台湾将恢复正常状态，亚洲紧张局势和纷争的根源也将消灭。
    要求书说，和平大会与会者根据上述立场，并且考虑日本人民曾经遭受两次原子弹爆炸祸害的历史事实，要求美国同意在太平洋亚洲地区建立无核武装地带。
    要求书要求美国永久停止进行核试验，并且停止冷战，承认和平共处的原则。
    大会还通过了关于要求日内瓦会议立即就缔结永久禁止试验核武器协定达成协议的决议，关于促使日本国会通过禁止日本进行核武装的法律和促使岸信介政府采取不实行核武装的措施的决议；关于为收回冲绳岛展开斗争的决议；关于促进缔结日苏和约的决议；关于促进实现旅日朝侨归国的决议；关于谴责岸信介政府非法对南越给予赔偿的决议；关于抗议南越政府大量屠杀政治犯的决议；关于反对“勤务评定”制度的决议。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：东京市民二万七千人今天下午举行大会，要求粉碎日美“安全条约”体系和恢复日中邦交。这次大会是在日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日本工会总评议会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、日本拥护宪法国民联合会、全国反对军事基地联络会议和东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议的共同倡议下，由四十多个各界团体联合召开的。
    东京的工人、农民、市民、青年、学生、妇女、工商业者等各阶层人民的代表都参加了这次大会。
    日本拥护宪法国民联合会会长片山哲、社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、共产党第一书记野坂参三、日本工会总评议会副议长今村彰等先后在大会上讲了话。他们一致指出，废除日美“安全条约”和恢复日中邦交，是为了日本的和平和繁荣而必须实现的目标。
    今村表示，拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会在这个决定性的时期，将同全日本工会会议和全国产业别工会联合会团结起来，站在全体国民的前列，进行坚决的斗争。
    野坂参三在讲话中指出，日本目前正站在要走核战争的道路还是走和平的道路的十字路口。他号召全体与会者立即行动起来，粉碎美国和岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    大会在热烈掌声中通过了决议。决议指出，美国同岸信介政府修改“安全条约”，意味着日本要公然参加日美“共同防御”体系，向海外派兵，并且允许运进美国的核武器，使日本走上核武装的道路。决议指出，很明显，这样做的结果，将无法打开日中关系僵局，恢复日中邦交也是不能指望的。
    决议说，全体与会者将吸取去年反对修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争的经验，同所有阶层的人民团结起来，为阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”，并且为争取恢复日中邦交而奋斗。
    大会发表了宣言。宣言号召全体人民从今天起，为粉碎日美“安全条约”体系和打开日中关系僵局而展开坚决的斗争。（附图片）
