    Joint Statement by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and Inejiro Asanuma, Head of the Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party to China

    Both sides believe that due to the anti-China policy pursued by the Nobusuke Kishi government, relations between the two countries have greatly deteriorated and are in a deadlock. This is completely against the wishes of the people of both countries. The Chinese side believes that the Nobusuke Kishi government must: (1) stop implementing its anti-China policy; (2) not participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; (3) not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan; and take corresponding measures to break this deadlock. Otherwise, reopening Sino-Japanese trade is also impossible. The Japanese Socialist Party fully agrees with the above-mentioned three principles put forward by China, and clearly advocates that it does not recognize the existence of "two Chinas," that the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, that it recognizes the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and that in order to achieve the formal restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, it must first abolish the "Japan-Chiang Peace Treaty" and sign a treaty with the People's Republic of China.

    Both sides firmly believe that the common goals of the Chinese and Japanese people in safeguarding world and Far Eastern peace, restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and promoting friendship between the two peoples will surely achieve complete victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Inejiro Asanuma, Head of the Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party to China, exchanged documents on their joint statement in Beijing today.

    President Zhang Xiruo and Head of Delegation Asanuma Inejiro exchanged texts at 11:20 p.m. tonight.

    The Chinese side participating in the exchange of documents included Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Changsheng, Li Dequan, Wang Zhen, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Cai Tingkai, Lu Xuzhang, Ji Chao Ding, Zhang Wenjin, Zhou Gengsheng, Yang Hansheng, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Anbo, and others.

    The Japanese Socialist Party Delegation to China participating in the exchange of documents included delegation members Katsumada Seiichi, Okada Muneyoshi, Sone Masaru, Nakazaki Satoshi, Sata Tadataka, Tanaka Toshio, attendants Hirosawa Kenichi and Watanabe Akira.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th. Joint Statement by Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Inejiro Asanuma, Head of the Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party to China.

    Amidst the high tide of the national movement in which the Japanese people are enthusiastically developing to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and shatter the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system, a delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party headed by Inejiro Asanuma visited the People's Republic of China in March 1959. Since the visit to China by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation in April 1957 and the publication of the joint statement by Zhang Xiruo and Asanuma, with the joint efforts of the people of China and Japan, the exchanges between the people of the two countries once made great progress. Unfortunately, due to the anti-China policy adopted by the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, relations between the two countries have been in an extremely abnormal state since May 1958. The purpose of this trip by the Japanese Socialist Party delegation is to express to the Chinese people the Japanese people's ardent desire for peace, democracy, and the earliest possible restoration of diplomatic relations with China, and to further develop people-to-people diplomacy in order to consolidate and develop the friendship between the two peoples and strengthen the efforts of the two peoples to eliminate the artificial obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

    Although diplomatic relations between the two countries have not been restored, and relations between the two countries have been almost completely interrupted since last spring, the Chinese side still welcomed the visit of the Socialist Party delegation.

    The head of the delegation, Inejiro Asanuma, and the members of the delegation, Katsumada Seiichi, Okada Muneyoshi, Sone Masaru, Nakazaki Satoshi, Sata Tadataka, Tanaka Toshio, and other seven people, during their visit, met with Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and held lengthy talks. The delegation also held several talks with Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and other relevant parties in China.

    The talks were conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere throughout, achieved several concrete achievements, and played an extremely important role in enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. Therefore, it was agreed to jointly publish the following points:

    Both sides reviewed the changes in the international situation since the publication of the joint statement by Zhang Xiruo and Asanuma in April 1957. Both sides unanimously believe that the forces against imperialism and colonialism are developing day by day throughout the world. This development is very beneficial to Japan's efforts to shatter the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system and return territories such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, as well as China's cause of liberating Taiwan. At the same time, in order to oppose the Cold War, oppose atomic warfare, realize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of Bandung, and ensure peace in Asia and the world, the people of the two countries must join hands.

    Both sides repeatedly emphasized that, in view of the current international and Asian situation, it is necessary to unconditionally and comprehensively prohibit the testing, manufacturing, stockpiling, and use of all types of nuclear weapons. To this end, countries possessing atomic weapons should promptly conclude an agreement prohibiting the testing, manufacturing, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons.

    The delegation expressed the Japanese Socialist Party's determination to jointly and faithfully defend the Peaceful Constitution with the Japanese people, prohibit Japan from manufacturing, stockpiling, using, and importing all nuclear weapons, and strive for Japan to issue a non-nuclear armed declaration on its own. The two sides reached a consensus on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific and jointly working with relevant countries to this end.

    The efforts made by the people of the two countries to improve relations between the two countries and develop people's friendship since the publication of the joint statement by Zhang Xiruo and Asanuma on April 22, 1957, have been highly praised.

    Both sides confirmed that, according to the geographical and historical relations between the two countries and the various existing circumstances, the governments of China and Japan should have immediately entered the stage of negotiations on the formal and comprehensive restoration of diplomatic relations. Unfortunately, however, due to the anti-China policy pursued by the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, relations between the two countries have deteriorated greatly and fallen into a deadlock. This is completely contrary to the wishes of the people of both countries.

    The Chinese side believes that the following three principles must be implemented, namely, the Nobusuke Kishi government must: (1) stop implementing its anti-China policy; (2) not participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; (3) not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan; and take corresponding measures to break this deadlock. Otherwise, reopening Sino-Japanese trade is also impossible.

    Based on the basic policy for opening up Japan-China relations determined on September 11 last year, the Japanese Socialist Party not only fully agrees with the above-mentioned three principles put forward by the Chinese side, but also clearly advocates that it does not recognize the existence of "two Chinas," that the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, that it recognizes the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and that in order to achieve the formal restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, it must first abolish the "Japan-Chiang Peace Treaty" and sign a treaty with the People's Republic of China. The Chinese side welcomes the above-mentioned proposition of the Japanese Socialist Party.

    The Chinese side further pointed out that the political and economic issues between the two countries cannot be separated, and economic and political issues must be discussed and resolved simultaneously; and at present, political issues must take priority. The delegation agreed to this.

    The Japanese Socialist Party delegation expressed the strong desire of the Japanese people to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Japan after breaking the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system, abolish military bases, achieve the complete return of Japanese territories such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, so as to establish Japan's independence and autonomy, and establish friendly relations with all countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and the Ten Principles of Bandung as its development. The Chinese side believes that Japan's achievement of complete independence and Japan's embarking on a path of peace and neutrality that does not belong to any military bloc is not only in the interests of the Japanese nation, but also conducive to peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome and support the early realization of this desire of the Japanese people. The Chinese side stated that Taiwan is China's territory, and U.S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The delegation believes that China's position is in line with the interests of peace in Asia and the world, expresses its heartfelt support for this, and hopes that it will be achieved through peaceful negotiations.

    After Japan shatters the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system, achieves complete independence, and concludes a mutual non-aggression pact with China and the Soviet Union, then it can be expected that the military clauses against Japan in the Sino Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance will naturally become invalid; and after the conclusion of a collective security treaty among countries in the Asian and Pacific region, especially among China, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States, Japan's neutral position will be further guaranteed. The two sides reached a consensus on this.

    The delegation emphasized that although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not been restored, and various exchanges between China and Japan have been almost completely interrupted since last spring, in order to strengthen the friendship between the people of the two countries and people-to-people diplomacy, such as friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges, some efforts should still be made under realistically possible conditions. The Chinese side expressed its approval of this and agreed to invite friendly delegations from Japan in the fields of culture, art, academia, technology, farmers, and workers to visit China. The delegation expressed to the Chinese side the wish of the Japanese people to invite Chinese non-governmental delegations to visit Japan. The Chinese side expressed its gratitude for the good intentions of the Japanese people and hoped that conditions will appear soon so that it can be invited to visit.

    Both sides unanimously believe that the Japanese Socialist Party delegation's visit to China under the current circumstances has made a positive contribution to further developing people-to-people diplomacy between China and Japan. Both sides firmly believe that the common goals of the Chinese and Japanese people in safeguarding world and Far Eastern peace, restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and promoting friendship between the two peoples will surely achieve complete victory.

    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若  日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎共同声明
    双方认为，由于岸信介政府执行的敌视中国政策，两国关系大为恶化，陷于僵局。这是完全违反两国人民的愿望的。中国方面认为，岸信介政府必须：（一）停止执行敌视中国的政策；（二）不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋；（三）不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复；并采取与此相应的措施，才能打开这种僵局。否则，重开中日贸易也是不可能的。日本社会党完全同意中国提出的上述三原则，并且明确主张，不承认“两个中国”的存在，解放台湾是中国的内政问题，承认中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权，并且为了达到中日邦交的正式恢复，必须首先废除“日蒋和约”，必须同中华人民共和国签订和约。
    双方深信，中日两国人民为维护世界和远东和平、恢复中日邦交、促进两国人民友好的共同目的，必将取得完全胜利。
    新华社17日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎共同声明，今天在北京进行换文。
    今晚十一时二十分，张奚若会长和浅沼稻次郎团长互换了文本。
    中国方面参加换文的，有郭沫若、廖承志、刘长胜、李德全、王震、楚图南、许广平、蔡廷锴、卢绪章、冀朝鼎、章文晋、周鲠生、阳翰笙、王芸生、赵安博等。
    日本社会党访华代表团方面参加换文的，有团员胜间田清一、冈田宗司、曾祢益、中崎敏、佐多忠隆、田中稔男，随员广泽贤一和渡边朗。
    新华社17日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若　日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎　共同声明
    在日本人民热烈展开恢复中日邦交和粉碎日美“安全保障”体制的国民运动的高潮中，日本社会党以浅沼稻次郎为首的代表团于1959年3月到中华人民共和国进行了访问。溯自1957年4月日本社会党访华使节团访问中国及张奚若、浅沼共同声明发表以后，在中日两国人民的共同努力下，两国人民之间的交往一度有很大的发展。但不幸，由于日本岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，1958年5月以后两国关系便陷于极不正常的状态。日本社会党访华代表团此行的目的就是向中国人民表达日本人民爱好和平、民主和尽速同中国恢复邦交的热烈愿望，并进一步开展国民外交，以巩固和发展两国人民的友谊，加强两国人民为消除中日关系正常化的人为障碍而作的努力。
    尽管两国间的邦交没有恢复，并且从去年春天以来两国关系几乎完全中断，中国方面仍然欢迎了社会党代表团的访问。
    代表团的团长浅沼稻次郎，团员胜间田清一、冈田宗司、曾祢益、中崎敏、佐多忠隆、田中稔男等七人，在访问的期间里，拜会了周恩来总理和陈毅副总理、彭真副委员长，并且进行了长时间的会谈。代表团还同中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和中国的其他有关方面进行了多次的会谈。
    会谈始终是在友好和诚挚的气氛中进行的，收到了若干的具体成就，并且对增进两国人民的友好起了极为重要的作用，因而同意共同发表以下各点：
    双方回顾了1957年4月张奚若、浅沼发表共同声明以来的国际形势的变化。双方一致认为，目前全世界反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的力量正在日益发展。这种发展，对于日本的粉碎日美“全安保障”体制和冲绳、小笠原群岛等领土的归还日本以及中国解放台湾的事业，是十分有利的。同时，为着反对冷战，反对原子战争，实现和平共处五项原则和万隆十项原则，确保亚洲和全世界的和平，两国人民必须携起手来。
    双方再三强调，鉴于目前的国际形势和亚洲形势，有必要无条件地全面禁止一切种类的核子武器的试验、制造、储存和使用。为此目的，持有原子武器的各国应该迅速缔结禁止核子武器的试验、制造、储存和使用的协定。
    代表团表示了日本社会党决心和日本人民共同忠实保卫和平宪法，禁止日本制造、储存、使用和运进一切核子武器，以及争取日本自行发表非核子武装宣言的立场。双方对于建立亚洲和太平洋非核子武装地区并且与有关各国为此共同进行努力一事，取得了一致的意见。
    1957年4月22日的张奚若、浅沼共同声明发表以来，两国人民为改善两国关系和发展人民友好所做的努力，博到极高的评价。
    双方确认，根据两国的地理历史关系和现存的各种情况，中日两国政府本来应该立即进入就正式和全面地恢复邦交问题进行谈判的阶段。但是不幸，由于日本岸信介政府执行的敌视中国政策，两国关系却反而大为恶化，陷于僵局。这是完全违反两国人民的愿望的。
    中国方面认为，必须实行下述三原则，即岸信介政府必须：（1）停止执行敌视中国的政策；（2）不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋；（3）不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复；并采取与此相应的措施，才能打开这种僵局。否则，重开中日贸易也是不可能的。　　　　　
    日本社会党根据它去年9月11日所确定的打开日中关系的基本方针，不仅完全同意中国方面提出的上述三原则，并且明确主张，不承认“两个中国”的存在，解放台湾是中国的内政问题，承认中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权，并且为了达到中日邦交的正式恢复，必须首先废除“日蒋和约”，必须同中华人民共和国签订和约，中国方面欢迎日本社会党的上述主张。
    中国方面进一步指出，两国之间的政治和经济问题不能分开，经济和政治问题必须同时商谈同时解决；而且在当前，政治问题必须居于优先地位。代表团对此表示同意。
    日本社会党代表团表示了日本人民要求在打破了所谓日美“安全保障”体制之后，撤退美国驻在日本的军队，取消军事基地，实现完全收回冲绳、小笠原群岛等日本领土，以确立日本的独立自主，并根据尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则和作为它的发展的万隆十项原则，同包括中国、苏联、美国在内的各个国家建立友好关系的强烈愿望。中国方面认为日本取得完全的独立和日本走上不属于任何军事集团的和平中立的道路，不仅符合日本的民族利益，而且也有利于亚洲和世界的和平。中国人民衷心地欢迎并支持日本人民的这一愿望能够早日实现。中国方面表示，台湾是中国的领土，美国军队必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤退。代表团认为，中国的这一立场是符合亚洲和世界和平的利益的，对此表示衷心的支持，并且希望它通过和平谈判得到实现。
    在日本粉碎了日美“安全保障”体制，实现了完全的独立，并且同中国和苏联缔结了互不侵犯协定之后，那末，可以期待以日本军国主义为对象的中苏友好同盟互助条约中对日本的军事条款将会自然归于失效；并在亚洲和太平洋地区各国间首先是中、日、苏、美间的集体安全条约缔结之后，日本的中立地位，将会得到进一步的保证。对此，双方取得了一致的看法。
    代表团强调地表示，尽管日本和中国之间尚未恢复邦交，并且自从去年春天以来，中日两国间的各种交流已经几乎完全中断，但是，为了加强两国人民的友谊、人民外交，如友好往来和文化交流等，在现实可能的条件下仍应有所增进。中国方面对此表示赞同，并同意邀请日本文化、艺术、学术、技术、农民、工人等方面的友好代表团来华访问。代表团向中国方面表达了日本人民邀请中国民间代表团去日本访问的愿望。中国方面对日本人民这种好意表示感谢，并且希望早日出现能够应邀前往访问的条件。
    双方一致认为，日本社会党代表团在目前情况下访问中国，对于进一步开展中日两国的人民外交作出了积极的贡献。双方深信，中日两国人民为维护世界和远东和平、恢复中日邦交、促进两国人民友好的共同目的，必将取得完全胜利。
