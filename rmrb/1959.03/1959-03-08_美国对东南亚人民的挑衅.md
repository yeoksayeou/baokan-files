    American Provocations Against the People of Southeast Asia
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's eight-day aerial military exercise is underway in Thailand. The American side is doing its utmost to promote this as the "largest" military exercise since the establishment of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, with "scenes of simulated atomic attacks." Although this military exercise is being carried out under the banner of Southeast Asian countries, only Thailand is a Southeast Asian country among the participating nations, while the United States, Britain, France, and other countries are Western colonial powers. This fact itself demonstrates that the Bangkok military exercise is a trick by the United States-led aggressive bloc to flaunt its military might against the people of the Southeast Asian region.
    The armed forces of Western colonial countries, led by the United States, have come to the land of Thailand to conduct exercises, supposedly to "defend Thailand," which is simply a huge joke. What is particularly ironic is that in this exercise to "defend Thailand," the Royal Thai Army has been assigned the role of "aggressor," while the Americans are playing the role of "defender." The Thai Air Force itself "invades" Thailand, and the United States goes to the trouble of "defending" it. This arrangement is painstakingly arranged. If it were reversed, wouldn't the face of the American aggressor appear even more realistic? The American propaganda machine is even attempting to portray China as the "imaginary enemy" of the military exercise. This is a completely shameless slander and an utter lie, which in no way conceals the aggressive and provocative nature of this military exercise.
    The US imperialists' planning of this military exercise at this time is closely coordinated with its other aggressive activities in the Southeast Asian region. In recent months, US imperialism has intensified its aggressive activities in the Southeast Asian region, especially in Indochina.
    The US imperialists are making every effort to plot the complete tearing up of the Geneva Accords, which maintain peace in Indochina. It openly incites the extreme pro-American elements in Laos to clamor for the abandonment of the Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue, so that the American aggressive forces can further infiltrate Laos. Not long ago, when the Royal Laotian Government clamored for the abolition of the International Commission for Laos, US State Department officials immediately expressed their support and gleefully declared that the United States could now "freely establish a military mission in Laos." A February 23 editorial in "The New York Times" more blatantly declared that the Geneva Accords were "worthless" and clamored for the United Nations to "maintain" the "freedom" of Laos. The facts show that US imperialism is implementing an aggressive plan to control the entire Indochina. Not only that, but the United States recently incited South Vietnam to invade the Xisha Islands of China and took the opportunity to publicize the so-called "possible outbreak of an East-West crisis" in order to exacerbate the tension in the Far East. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military exercise at this time is an important part of the United States' recent series of aggressive activities in Southeast Asia. This is a military intimidation and a serious provocation against the people of Southeast Asian countries.
    No matter how ferocious the US imperialists may appear, they can absolutely not frighten the peace-loving people of Southeast Asia who are determined to strive for national independence. The United States' behavior of flaunting its military might and creating tension in the Southeast Asian region can only further expose its face as an aggressor.

    美国对东南亚人民的挑衅
    本报评论员
    东南亚条约集团为期八天的空中军事演习，正在泰国进行。美国方面竭力宣传这是东南亚侵略集团成立以来“规模最大的”军事演习，并且有“假装原子攻击的场面”。这次军事演习虽然打着东南亚国家的旗号，但参加演习的国家中，只有一个泰国是东南亚国家，而美、英、法等国都是西方殖民国家。这个事实本身说明，曼谷军事演习是以美国为首的侵略集团对东南亚地区人民炫耀武力的把戏。
    以美国为首的西方殖民国家的武装力量开到泰国的土地上去进行演习，据说是为了“保卫泰国”的，这简直是天大的笑话。而尤其富有讽刺意味的是，在这场“保卫泰国”的演习中，泰国皇家军队被派定充当“侵略者”的角色，而美国人反倒充当了“保卫者”。泰国空军自己“侵略”泰国，却有劳美国去进行“保卫”，这种安排是煞费苦心的。如果对调过来，美国侵略者的面目不是就会显得更加逼真了吗？美国宣传机器竟然企图把中国说成是军事演习“假想敌人”，这完全是无耻的诬蔑和彻头彻尾的谎言，它丝毫也都掩盖不了这次军事演习的侵略的和挑衅的实质。
    美国帝国主义在这个时候策划这个军事演习，是同它在东南亚地区进行的其它侵略活动密切配合的。近几个月来，美帝国主义加紧了对东南亚地区，特别是对印度支那的侵略活动。
    美帝国主义者正在竭力策划彻底撕毁维护印度支那和平的日内瓦协议的阴谋。它公开唆使老挝的极端亲美分子叫喊废弃关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，以便美国侵略势力进一步渗入老挝。不久前，当老挝王国政府叫喊取消老挝国际委员会的时候，美国国务院官员立即表示支持，并且兴高采烈地宣称今后美国可以“自由地在老挝设立一个军事使团”。2月23日“纽约时报”的社论更露骨地宣称，日内瓦协议“毫无价值”，叫嚷要由联合国来“保持”老挝的“自由”。事实表明，美国帝国主义正在执行一项阴谋控制整个印度支那的侵略计划。不仅如此，美国最近还唆使南越侵犯中国领土西沙群岛，并借此大肆宣传所谓“可能爆发东西方危机”，以加剧远东的紧张局势。东南亚条约集团在这个时候进行军事演习，正是美国最近时期在东南亚一系列侵略活动的一个重要组成部分。这是对于东南亚各国人民的武力恫吓和严重挑衅。
    不管美帝国主义者怎样张牙舞爪，它绝对吓唬不了东南亚地区爱好和平和决心争取民族独立的各国人民。美国在东南亚地区炫耀武力、制造紧张局势的行为，其结果只能是进一步暴露了它的侵略者的面目。
