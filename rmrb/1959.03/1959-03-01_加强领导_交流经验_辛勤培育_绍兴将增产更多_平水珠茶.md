Strengthen Leadership, Exchange Experiences, Diligent Cultivation
Shaoxing Will Increase Production of "Ping Shui Pearl Tea"

    (Our report) Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, which is rich in "Ping Shui Pearl Tea," has launched a wave of tea garden cultivation. In 1958, Shaoxing County's tea production, like other productions, made a tremendous leap forward. The county's 23,867 mu of tea gardens (excluding 2,236 mu of new tea gardens) that were actually harvested had an average yield of 151 jin of tea per mu, an increase of 35.8% compared to 1957. The quality of tea has also greatly improved, with the quantity of special grade tea increasing fourteen times compared to 1957. The increase in both yield and quality has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for cultivating and developing tea production.

    In order to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, the Shaoxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's communes in various tea-producing areas have summarized and applied the experience of tea production increase in 1958 at all levels, and improved the organizational leadership. The County Committee assigned a secretary to be responsible for the leadership of mountain production, and strengthened the work at the tea base points. The County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry also moved the office in charge of mountain work to the mountains to specifically summarize the experience of tea production, and transferred 45 cadres from tea factories and purchasing stations to help tea farmers with their work. The people's communes in the four tea-producing areas of the county have established 151 fixed professional teams, and established a tea production responsibility system with fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed quality, and fixed time, as well as a competition and reward system. In addition, 35 cadres in charge of tea production from various communes were organized to study advanced experiences in Qimen and Shexian counties in Anhui Province. The county has successively held three on-site meetings on pruning, frost prevention, and fertilization, and communes, brigades, and production teams have also held more than 40 experience exchange meetings, and launched a vigorous debate among commune members on how to strive for a greater harvest in 1959, setting off a vigorous tea garden cultivation movement. The relevant departments of this county have also specially allocated 14,000 dan of vegetable cakes for the tea gardens. At present, more than 11,000 dan of cake fertilizer, more than 974,000 dan of pig and cattle manure, scorched mud ash, and compost have been applied to the tea gardens, and the fertilized area has reached more than 20,000 mu. There have also been new developments in fertilization methods. In the past, fertilization was generally applied to the surface soil of the tea gardens or in a shallow ditch, but this year, for tea trees on steep slopes, a deep ditch is dug at the roots, fertilizer is applied, and then covered with soil; tea trees on flat land are fertilized by opening ditches around the roots to maintain the fertilizer effect. In addition, 12,000 mu of tea gardens in the county have been intercropped with green manure seeds, opening up a source of fertilizer for the tea gardens. At present, 6,000 dan of fertilizer powder is also stored, to be used as germination fertilizer when the buds emerge in early March. The experience of the County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry in pruning 125 mu of tea gardens in Pingyang Tea Farm of Pingshui People's Commune in 1958, which increased tea production by 63%, has been promoted in nearly 10,000 mu of tea gardens. In addition, 1,500 mu of tea gardens with missing plants have been replanted.

    After such diligent cultivation, the growth of tea trees has been greatly promoted. Although this year the tea trees have suffered more severe frost than in previous years, they are still growing very vigorously. Tea farmers at the foot of Mount Kuaiji said happily, "This year will definitely be a bumper harvest year."

    加强领导　交流经验　辛勤培育
    绍兴将增产更多“平水珠茶”
    本报讯　盛产“平水珠茶”的浙江绍兴县，已掀起培育茶园的热潮。绍兴县1958年茶叶生产和其他生产一样，有了巨大的跃进。全县实采茶叶的二万三千八百六十七亩茶园（二千二百三十六亩新茶园除外），平均亩产茶一百五十一斤，比1957年增产35.8％。茶叶的质量也大大提高，仅特级茶数量就比1957年增加了十四倍。由于产量和质量的提高，更鼓舞了广大社员对培育和发展茶叶生产的积极性。
    为了争取更大更好更全面的跃进，中共绍兴县委和各茶区人民公社已经层层总结运用了1958年茶叶增产的经验，健全了组织领导。县委由一个书记负责对山区生产的领导，并且加强了茶叶基点工作；县农林局也将分管山区工作的办公室搬到山区去具体总结茶叶生产经验，并从茶厂，收购站里抽调了四十五个干部帮助茶农进行工作。全县四个茶区的人民公社建立了固定专业队一百五十一个，并且建立了定人、定任务、定质量、定时间的茶叶生产责任制，和竞赛奖励制度。此外，还组织各公社负责茶叶生产的干部三十五人到安徽省的祁门、歙县去学习先进经验。全县已经先后召开了三次修剪、防冻、施肥等现场会议，各公社、大队、生产小队间也召开了四十多次交流经验的会议，并发动社员就怎样争取1959年更大丰收的问题进行了鸣放辩论，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的培育茶园运动。这个县的有关部门还为茶园专门调拨出菜饼一万四千担。现在全县已施入茶园的肥料有饼肥一万一千多担，猪牛栏粪、焦泥灰、堆肥九十七万四千多担，施肥面积已达二万多亩。在施肥的方法上也有了新的发展。以往施肥一般都施在茶园的表土上或是挖一条浅沟，而今年，陡山坡茶树都在根部挖一条深沟，施上肥，再盖上土；平地茶树进行围根开沟施肥，以保持肥效。此外，全县有一万二千亩茶园套播了绿肥草子，为茶园开辟了肥源。目前还贮存了六千担肥田粉，留在3月初发芽时作催芽肥用。1958年县农林局在平水人民公社平阳茶场的一百二十五亩茶园中进行修剪，使茶叶增产63％的经验，已在近万亩茶园中推广。此外，还补植了缺株茶园一千五百亩。
    经过这样一番辛勤的培育工作，大大促进了茶树的生长，今年茶树虽然受到了往年更严重的冰冻，但生长得还很旺盛。会稽山下的茶农，朝着茶园高兴地说：“今年一定是个丰收年。”
