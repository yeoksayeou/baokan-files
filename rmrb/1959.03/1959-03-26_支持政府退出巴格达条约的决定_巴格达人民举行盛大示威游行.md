Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 25th: People in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, held a large-scale demonstration today to support the Iraqi government's decision to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and to try the traitorous elements of the Mosul rebellion.

The demonstrators sang and danced happily in the streets. They poured into Zubeida Square, the center of Baghdad, from all directions. A grand mass rally was held in the square.

The marching crowds carried many banners with slogans such as: "Down with the Baghdad Pact," "We are liberated from the Baghdad Pact," "Long live the Republic and Qasim," and "For the beloved Republic, we demand severe punishment for the traitors."

The delegation from Mosul was warmly welcomed. Wherever they went, people surrounded them, cheered them, and shouted slogans expressing respect to the heroic people of Mosul, thanking them for their contributions to the Republic in the struggle against the rebellious conspiracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 25th: Brigadier General Khalil Said, commander of the Third Division of the Iraqi Army, sent a telegram to Prime Minister Qasim, supporting his statement on withdrawing from the Baghdad Pact.

The telegram stated, "You have announced to the world the withdrawal of the Iraqi Republic from the Baghdad Pact, thereby ensuring the basic demands of the people and the army. You have freed our beloved Iraq from the shackles of shame and the heavy yoke. We believe that true independence cannot accept the rule of foreigners or partnership with them; whoever accepts the chains of imperialist alliances cannot be free. We have always believed that the future belongs to the loyal and free people, to the people, the nation, and the motherland."

The telegram said, "You have chosen the camp of the people, the camp of freedom and peace, and we supported you from the beginning. We will always defend and maintain the honor of Iraq, the revolution of July 14th, and your decisive and beloved leadership."

    游行的人在街上欢乐地唱歌跳舞。他们从四面八方涌向巴格达的中心祖贝达广场。广场上举行了盛大的群众集会。
    游行队伍举着许多横幅，上面写着：“打倒巴格达条约”、“我们从巴格达条约中解放出来了”、
  “共和国和卡塞姆万岁”、“为了可爱的共和国，我们要求严厉惩办卖国贼”。
    从摩苏尔来的代表团受到人们的热情的欢迎。无论他们走到那里，人们都把他们围住，向他们欢呼，高呼向英勇的摩苏尔人民表示敬意的口号，感谢他们在同叛乱阴谋进行的斗争中对共和国所作的贡献。
    新华社巴格达25日电　伊拉克陆军第三师师长哈利勒·赛义德准将致电卡塞姆总理，支持他关于退出巴格达条约的声明。
    电报说，“你向全世界宣布伊拉克共和国退出巴格达条约，从而确保了人民和军队的基本要求。你使我们热爱的伊拉克摆脱了耻侮的锁链和沉重的枷锁。我们相信，真正的独立不能接受外国人的统治或同他们合伙，谁接受帝国主义联盟的锁链，谁就不能自由。我们一直相信，未来是属于忠诚、自由的人的，是属于人民、民族和祖国的”。
