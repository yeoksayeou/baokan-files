Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd dispatch from TASS: The "Pravda" published on the 2nd an editorial entitled "The Magnificent Communist Advance" commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist International.

The article stated that in the history of the international communist movement spanning more than a century, the founding of the Communist International was a glorious page. The Communist International played a decisive role in establishing modern mass Marxist-Leninist parties.

The founding of the Communist International was prepared by the entire process of social and historical development in the era of imperialism, the victory of the Russian socialist revolution, and the great revolutionary upsurges in many countries. Its establishment was the result of a long-term and uncompromising struggle led by Lenin and the Bolsheviks on the domestic and international stage. This struggle was to fight for the purity and creative development of Marxism, for proletarian internationalism under the battle cry of Marx and Engels' "Workers of the world, unite!", for the establishment of revolutionary parties of the working class, against bourgeois ideology and its various manifestations—reformism, opportunism, revisionism—and against sectarian "leftism."

The article said that the great contribution of the Communist International lies in: defending Marxist doctrine and preventing it from being vulgarized by opportunists; promoting the formation of true workers' parties by the advanced worker vanguards of many countries, and helping these parties mobilize the working masses to defend their economic and political interests, and fight against fascism and imperialist wars; strengthening the internationalist solidarity of the working class worldwide; and fighting for the development and victory of the national liberation movement.

The article stated that the organizational form of uniting workers selected by the First Congress of the Communist International was in line with the requirements of the initial stage of the worker movement's recovery. As this movement developed and its tasks became more complex, this organizational form increasingly appeared outdated in some countries. Due to the growth and political maturity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and their leading cadres, the Communist International announced its dissolution in 1943 based on the decision of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. During its existence, this militant international organization of the working class played a significant historical role in promoting the liberation struggle of the working people and in uniting the forces of the working people on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology. Under the leadership of the Communist International, the international communist youth movement arose and developed.

The article said that the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties established in 1947 was an important factor in further strengthening the proletarian internationalism and unity of the international communist movement and in uniting the working class and all working people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. As its tasks were completed, the Information Bureau ceased its activities in 1956 with the mutual consent of the Central Committees of the Communist and Workers' Parties that joined the Bureau.

The article said that forty years ago, on the days when the Communist International held its First Congress, communist ideas and small communist groups existed only in a few countries. Now, however, Communist and Workers' Parties have been established in eighty-three countries, with a total of more than 33 million members. In the twelve countries of Europe and Asia that make up the powerful and indestructible socialist camp, the Communist and Workers' Parties are leading the people in building socialism and communism.

At present, the international communist movement is more united than ever. This movement is united by the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism, by the common goal of liberating laboring humanity, and by the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the Congress of Communist Builders—has opened up new and inspiring prospects for the international communist and worker movement and for all mankind. The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan approved by the Congress will have a tremendous impact on the entire course of world development, will strengthen the positions of the socialist camp, will further strengthen the forces of peace and further weaken the forces of war, and will attract millions of new active fighters to the side of socialism.

The article said that the great achievements of the Soviet people and the people of all socialist countries, their magnificent creative plans, are a powerful moral support to the working class and all working people in capitalist countries in their struggle for their right to live, for peace, freedom and democracy, and against reactionary forces and imperialism.

International reactionary forces are very afraid of the growth of socialist forces, and they are launching an offensive against the communist movement and the worker movement. It uses lies such as the so-called "free world" and the democracy of bourgeois countries to carry out social demagoguery and deceive the masses. Under the guise of freedom and equality, reactionary forces are becoming increasingly rampant, intensifying their trampling on the democratic rights of the masses, and in some capitalist countries are turning or attempting to turn to open dictatorship. Ominous signs of the revival of fascism are becoming increasingly obvious. In this situation, Lenin's words at the First Congress of the Communist International are even louder and more powerful. He said at the time that no matter how brutal the bourgeoisie of the world is, how it expels, imprisons, and even kills Communists, all of this will still not save the bourgeoisie. Armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and years of experience in the anti-fascist struggle, and strengthened by internationalist solidarity, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will resolutely counterattack the reactionary offensive.

The article said that at the First Congress of the Communist International, Lenin spoke about the international significance of the great example of our working class and laboring peasants who seized power, established a socialist state, and began to build a new society. For more than forty years, our country has gone through a long and arduous road of struggle and victory. Communists and progressive humanity around the world regard the Soviet Union as the fortress of all socialist countries and the world communist movement. Our country was the first to pave the way for mankind to socialism, it is the most powerful country in the world socialist system, and it was the first to enter the period of full-scale communist construction.

The article said that the strength of the Communist and Workers' Parties lies in their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and in their creative development and application of advanced revolutionary theory. The strength of the Communist and Workers' Parties lies in their international unity and fraternal, unbreakable internationalist relations. The meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow in November 1957 powerfully demonstrated this. The meeting declaration, unanimously endorsed by all Communist and Workers' Parties and confirmed by life itself, has become a program for the internationalist unity of the world communist movement. On the basis of the implementation of the principles of the declaration, the strength within the Communist Parties of various countries has been further united, the international communist movement has been more closely united, modern revisionism has been exposed and condemned, and a resolute rebuff has been given to the Yugoslav revisionists.

The powerful unity and solidarity of the international communist movement was powerfully demonstrated at the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Delegations from Marxist-Leninist parties in seventy-two countries participated in the Congress. The spirit of solidarity and mutual support of the Marxist-Leninist parties, and the spirit of proletarian internationalism, were reflected in the congratulatory messages and letters to the Congress, and in the reports on the Congress made by the delegations after returning to their countries.

The article concluded by saying that forty years ago, at the birthplace of the founding of the Communist International, the great Lenin expressed his unwavering confidence in the future victory of communism. Now, hundreds of millions of people are advancing under the banner of socialism and communism. Tomorrow, tens of millions and hundreds of millions of selfless fighters will come under this banner. The magnificent communist advance is unstoppable, and the future belongs to it!

    共产主义进军波澜壮阔
    苏联真理报发表编辑部文章
    纪念共产国际成立四十周年
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：  “真理报”2日发表了一篇题为“波澜壮阔的共产主义进军”的编辑部文章，纪念共产国际成立四十周年。
    文章说，在国际共产主义运动的一百多年的历史中，共产国际的成立写下了光辉的一页。共产国际在建立现代群众性的马克思列宁主义政党中起了决定性的作用。
    共产国际的成立是由帝国主义时期社会历史发展的整个进程、俄国社会主义革命的胜利和许多国家革命的巨大高涨所准备好了的。它的成立是以列宁为首的布尔什维克在国内和国际舞台上进行长期的、毫不妥协的斗争的结果。这种斗争就是争取马克思主义的纯洁和创造性的发展，争取在马克思和恩格斯的“全世界无产者团结起来”的战斗口号下的无产阶级国际主义，争取建立工人阶级的革命政党，反对资产阶级的意识形态及其各种表现——改良主义、机会主义、修正主义，反对宗派主义的“左倾”。
    文章说，共产国际的伟大功绩在于：它捍卫了马克思主义学说，使马克思主义学说没有被机会主义者庸俗化；它促进许多国家的先进工人先锋队结成真正的工人政党，并帮助这些政党动员劳动群众保卫自己的经济利益和政治利益，为反对法西斯和帝国主义战争而斗争；它加强了全世界工人阶级的国际主义团结；它为争取民族解放运动的发展和胜利进行了斗争。
    文章说，共产国际第一次大会所选定的联合工人的组织形式是符合工人运动恢复初期阶段的要求的，随着这一运动的发展和它的任务的复杂化，这种组织形式在某些国家里便日益显得过时了。由于各国共产党和工人党及其领导干部的成长和政治上的成熟，根据共产国际执行委员会主席团的决议，共产国际于1943年宣布解散。共产国际这一工人阶级的战斗性的国际组织，在其存在期间，对于推动劳动人民的解放斗争，对于在马克思列宁主义思想基础上团结劳动人民的力量，起过重大的历史作用。在共产国际的领导之下，兴起和发展了国际共产主义青年运动。
    文章说，1947年建立的各国共产党和工人党情报局，是进一步加强国际共产主义运动队伍的无产阶级国际主义和团结工人阶级和全体劳动者为争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的重要因素。随着它的任务的完成，在加入情报局的各国共产党和工人党的中央委员会的彼此同意下，情报局于1956年停止活动。
    文章说，四十年前，在共产国际举行第一次大会的日子里，仅仅在少数国家中存在着共产主义的思潮和人数很少的共产主义小组，而现在却在八十三个国家里成立了共产党和工人党，它们一共拥有三千三百多万党员。在组成强大而不可摧毁的社会主义阵营的欧亚十二个国家里，共产党和工人党领导着建设社会主义和共产主义的人民。
    目前国际共产主义运动比任何时候都更加一致和团结。这个运动是由马克思列宁主义的共同意识形态，是由解放劳动人类的共同目标，是由争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争而团结在一起的。具有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会——共产主义建设者的代表大会，给国际共产主义运动和工人运动、给全人类打开了新的令人鼓舞的前景。代表大会批准的七年计划的实现，将对世界发展的整个进程起巨大的影响，将加强社会主义阵营的阵地，将使和平力量进一步壮大和使战争势力进一步削弱，将把千百万新的积极战士吸引到社会主义方面来。
    文章说，苏联人民和所有社会主义国家的人民所取得的伟大成就，他们的宏伟的创造性计划，是对资本主义国家的工人阶级和全体劳动者争取自己的生活权利，争取和平、自由和民主，反对反动势力和帝国主义的斗争的强有力的道义上的支持。
    国际反动势力非常害怕社会主义力量的壮大，它向共产主义运动和工人运动展开进攻。它用所谓“自由世界”和资产阶级国家的民主主义等类谎言来进行社会蛊惑宣传，来欺骗群众。在自由、平等口号的掩饰下，反动势力日益猖獗，日益加紧蹂躏人民群众的民主权利，而在某些资本主义国家中已在转向或企图转向公开的独裁。法西斯主义复活的不祥之兆已经越来越明显。在这种情况下，列宁在共产国际第一次大会上讲的话就更加响亮，更加有力。他当时说，不管全世界的资产阶级如何残暴，如何驱逐、囚禁、甚至杀害共产党人，但是，这一切仍然挽救不了资产阶级。以马克思列宁主义理论和多年的反法西斯斗争经验武装起来的、由于国际主义团结而坚强有力的各国共产党和工人党，将给反动派的进攻以坚决的反击。
    文章说，在共产国际第一次大会上，列宁谈到了夺取了政权、建立了社会主义国家和着手建设新社会的我国工人阶级和劳动农民的伟大榜样的国际意义。四十多年来我国经历了漫长的、艰苦的斗争和胜利的道路。共产党人，全世界进步人类把苏联看成是一切社会主义国家和世界共产主义运动的堡垒。我国首先铺平了人类走向社会主义的道路，它是世界社会主义体系中最强大的国家，它第一个进入了全面展开共产主义建设的时期。
    文章说，共产党和工人党的力量在于它们忠于马克思列宁主义，在于它们创造性地发展和运用先进的革命理论。共产党和工人党的力量在于它们的国际团结和兄弟般的、牢不可破的国际主义关系。1957年11月在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议有力地显示了这一点。所有共产党和工人党所一致赞同的、并且为生活本身所证实了的会议宣言，成为世界共产主义运动的国际主义团结的纲领。在实现宣言的原则的基础上，各国共产党内部的力量进一步团结了，国际共产主义运动更加紧密地团结一致了，透露并谴责了现代修正主义，并给予南斯拉夫修正主义者以坚决的回击。
    国际共产主义运动的强大的统一和团结在苏共第二十一次代表大会上十分有力地显示出来。有七十二个国家的马克思列宁主义政党的代表团参加了代表大会。在贺词和给代表大会的贺信中，在代表团回国后所作的关于代表大会的报告中，反映出马克思列宁主义政党的团结一致和相互支持的精神，反映出无产阶级国际主义精神。
    文章最后说，四十年以前在共产国际成立的发源地，伟大的列宁表示了对共产主义未来胜利的坚定不移的信心。现在，几亿人民在社会主义和共产主义的旗帜下前进。明天，还将有几千万和几万万忘我的战士走到这个旗帜下面。波澜壮阔的共产主义进军是不可阻挡的，未来是属于它的！
