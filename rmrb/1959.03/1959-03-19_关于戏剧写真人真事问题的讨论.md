Discussion on the Question of Drama Depicting Real People and Real Events

The "Drama" monthly magazine in January and February this year launched a discussion on the creation of new heroic figures and the question of depicting real people and real events. This is a very meaningful discussion involving current literary and artistic creation issues. Here, we excerpt some opinions on the issue of "depicting real people and real events."

Neither Rigidly Adhering to Real People and Events, Nor Violating Historical Truth

We have performed many scripts based on real people and events, such as "Liu Hulan," "Red Storm," "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and "Egret." These scripts all praise heroic figures. From these scripts, we feel that it is possible to write scripts based on real people and events, but it is best not to rigidly adhere to them. If you are too rigid in adhering to real people and events, the restrictions on creation are very large. It is better to concentrate on summarizing and processing. For heroes who have historical conclusions, such as Liu Hulan, Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, and Liu Xifen, the historical truth should be taken care of on major issues, and creation is allowed in specific details, that is, neither rigidly adhering to the materials of real people and real events, nor violating historical truth. In "Red Storm," Lin Xiangqian did not originally live in a broken shed in the material, and his life was not so hard, but the script wrote him as living in a broken shed, which is beneficial to portraying this character. There was no character like Xiuying in the material of "Liu Hulan," but the playwright added this character. However, the first draft of "Egret" wrote Liu Xifen's sister as a traitor, and she herself was not a traitor, which aroused people's opposition. This kind of behavior of demeaning and distorting others in order to express a heroic figure is inappropriate. Therefore, the performance version was revised with the consent of the original author, and the sister was changed to the current appearance. Of course, the specific details are not exactly the same as her sister's life at the time, but important issues (the issue of whether there was a betrayal) have taken care of historical truth. Scripts written based on real people and events, like other creations, cannot be separated from politics to pursue artistic integrity.

Real People and Events and Refining Themes

From real people and events to vivid artistic images—this is the entire work of artistic creation. What a creator painstakingly wants to do is such a thing. However, everyone has their own approach. Some use a specific person and a specific thing, and through scheduling and arrangement, discard the crude and select the refined, and successfully create a work of art; but even so, he is based on his entire life experience, otherwise he will not be able to grasp this specific person and this specific thing, and there is no way to arrange and schedule, discard the crude and select the refined. Some others conceive their works and create artistic images based on many people and many things. Whether it is based on one person and one thing, or based on many people and many things, in the final analysis, artistic creation cannot be separated from these people and these things. That is to say, it cannot be separated from real life. The “characters” in myths cannot escape this rule, but they are reflected more tortuously, let alone the works of art that express real life? However, it can also be seen from this that the original appearance of life, without any production, cannot become a work of art, and it is also a rule that creators cannot escape. Therefore, the matter of depicting real people and real events itself has no gains or losses to speak of, and the issue of gains and losses lies in other aspects.

What aspects do gains and losses lie in?

I don’t think it lies in the phenomenon that some authors are tied up because they are confined to real people and events. In my opinion, the main reason for the emergence of this phenomenon is not because the author only creates based on one person and one thing, but because the author's life experience and creative experience are insufficient to restrain himself. Most of these authors are beginners in writing, or amateur authors in the masses. I think I can understand the difficulties of such authors, because I am one of them. When I am studying and writing some "homework," I always write down a thing and a few people that I know, roughly without any difference. Sometimes I also want to conduct more comprehensive and generalisation, but limited by my ideological level and artistic accomplishment, it is even more difficult, and it often does not work well. Therefore, for this phenomenon, I think it is more practical to talk about it from the perspective of refining themes rather than talking about the gains and losses of depicting real people and real events.

Works Depicting Real People and Events Also Have Concentration and Selection

In fact, it is impossible to completely depict real people and events. Those works that depict real people and events actually have concentration and selection. A person lives for decades in life, and attends a meeting for several hours. We have never seen a work that depicts real people and events, truthfully writing out his decades of life without any omissions, because the space and time in the work are greatly reduced. A play lasts a maximum of three and a half hours, how can it be possible to truthfully hold a meeting for three hours on the theatrical stage?! Therefore, works depicting real people and events only write about one thing or a fragment of it, and it is impossible to be completely the same as real people and events. However, in reality, some people seriously demand the authenticity of even individual plots in these works depicting real people and events, and even require that the voice and gestures must be the same as the real person. This is not right and is harmful to creation. Writers do not have to adhere to the details of real events in life, but should be loyal to the essence of life, grasp the main things in the development of life (of course, secondary ones are not absolutely not to be written), and can boldly abandon non-essential things, and only by abandoning non-essential things can it have higher generalisation and greater authenticity.

Writing works should not be limited to being completely the same as real people and events, and it is necessary to use real names and surnames. Requiring that the details of every event are the same is self-defeating and violates the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. However, works depicting real people and events among the masses cannot be compared with this. Some works written by the masses are also processed and selected. Some because they have a limited understanding of the scope of life, it is also difficult to make a greater generalization. For these works, they should first be encouraged, and at the same time, higher requirements should be put forward to them, requiring them to gradually free themselves from the situation of depicting real people and events, and write higher works, not only can they make natural records of touching deeds, but also can better carry out drama creation. This is entirely possible, and the facts have also proved this point.

### 关于戏剧写真人真事问题的讨论

专栏：报刊文艺评论摘要

    关于戏剧写真人真事问题的讨论
    今年1、2月号“剧本”月刊上展开了关于创造新英雄人物和写真人真事问题的讨论。这是一个涉及到当前文艺创作问题的很有意义的讨论。在这里，我们摘要发表了其中对于“写真人真事”问题的一些意见。
    既不拘泥于真人真事，又不能违反历史真实
    我们演出过不少以真人真事为基础的剧本，如“刘胡兰”“红色风暴”“把一切献给党”“白鹭”等，这些剧本都是歌颂英雄人物的，从这些剧本我们觉得根据真人真事的素材是可以写作剧本的，但是最好不要拘泥于真人真事。如果过于拘泥真人真事，对创作的限制是很大的。能集中概括加工要好些，对于历史上有了定论的英雄，如刘胡兰、林祥谦、施洋、刘惜芬等在重大的问题上应照顾历史的真实性，在具体细节上是容许创造的，既不拘泥于真人真事的素材，而又不违背历史真实。“红色风暴”原来素材中林祥谦并不是住在破棚子里，生活也没那么苦，但剧本把他写成住在破棚里，这对刻划这个人物有利。“刘胡兰”的素材中并没有秀英这个人物，但剧作者增加了这一个人物。但“白鹭”初稿把刘惜芬的姐姐写成叛徒，而本人又不是叛徒，引起人们的反对，这种为了表现一个英雄人物，不惜把别人贬低了、歪曲了，这是不妥当的。因此演出本经过原作者同意作了修改，把姐姐改成现在的样子。当然具体的细节也并不是与她姐姐当时的生活完全一样，不过重要的问题（有无叛变的问题）已照顾到历史真实了。根据真人真事写作的剧本，和其他的创作一样，是不能脱离政治去追求艺术的完整性的。
      （吴雪：“关于描写英雄人物及其他”）
    真人真事和提炼题材
    从真人真事到活生生的艺术形象——这便是艺术创作的全部工作。一个创作者煞费苦心要做的，就是这么一件事情。不过各人有各人的做法。有的采用一个具体的人、一件具体的事，经过调度安排，去粗取精，创作成功一部艺术作品；不过即使是这样，他也是以他的全部生活经验作基础的，否则他就无法掌握住这个具体的人、这件具体的事，也无从安排调度，去粗取精。有的则是根据许多人、许多事来构思他的作品，来创造艺术形象。根据一个人、一件事也好，根据许多人、许多事也好，归根结底，艺术创作离不开这些人，这些事。也就是说离不开现实生活。神话中的
  “人物”，都逃不脱这件规律，只不过反映得曲折一些罢了，何况表现现实生活的艺术作品呢？但是也由此可见，生活的原样，不加制作，却不能成为艺术作品，也是创作者逃不脱的一条规律。所以，写真人真事这件事本身，没有什么得失可言，得失问题在于别的方面。
    得失在于哪些方面呢？
    我觉得也不在于有些作者因为囿于真人真事而被捆住了手脚这样一种现象上。这种现象的产生，依我看，主要的原因不是因为作者只根据一个人、一件事而进行创作，是因为作者的生活经验和创作经验不足而束缚了自己。这样的作者大都是初学写作的，或者是群众中的业余作者。我觉得我能了解这样的作者的苦处，因为我是其中的一个。当自己作为学习，要写一些“作业”的时候，总是根据自己知道一件事，几个人，和原样大致不差地写下来，有时也想进行更多的综合和概括，但是限于思想水平和艺术修养，吃力更甚，而且往往搞不好，所以对于这种现象，我觉得与其从写真人真事的得失上谈，不如从提炼题材的角度上谈，更切合实际。
    （乔羽：“也谈写真人真事”）
    写真人真事的作品也是有集中和选择的
    实际上完全写真人真事也是不可能的，那些写真人真事的作品实际上也有了集中和选择的。生活中一个人生存几十年，开一个会几个钟头，我们从没有见过一个写真人真事的作品，真实地把他几十年的生活无遗地都写出来，因为作品中的空间和时间是大大缩小了，一个戏最多三个半小时，怎可能如实地在戏剧舞台上开三个钟头会呢？！因此写真人真事的作品，只不过是写其中的一桩事、一个片断，根本不可能完全和真人真事一样。但是在现实中就有些人对这些写真人真事的作品，连个别情节的真实性都要认真的要求，甚至说话声音和手势必须和真人一样，这是不应该的，是对创作有害的。作家不必拘泥于生活中的实事的细节，要忠实于生活的本质，抓住生活发展中主要的（当然次要的也不是绝对不要写）可以大胆抛弃非本质的事物，而且只有抛弃非本质的东西，才能具有更高的概括性，和具有更大的真实性。
    写作品不要限于完全与真人真事一样，非用真名实姓不可。要求与每一事件的细节都一样，这是作茧自缚，也是违反革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法的。但对于群众中写真人真事的作品，就不能与此同日而语。群众写的作品有的也是经过加工和选择的。有的因为他们了解生活范围有限，也难于作更大概括，对于这些作品首先应该鼓励，同时对他们提出更高的要求，要求他们逐渐从写真人真事的情况下解脱出来，写出更高的作品，不只是对可歌可泣的事能作自然形态的记录，也能更好的进行戏剧创作，这是完全可能的，而且事实也证明了这一点。
