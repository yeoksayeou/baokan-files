Two Sentries
Zhang Ming

I.

On the third night of the field exercise, the Third Company of the artillery regiment camped in a village. The lights-out bugle had sounded, and bright moonlight streamed through the paper windows into the farmhouse's hallway, illuminating the soldiers sleeping on the straw mats.

Division Commander Yang, who had been sent down to serve as a soldier, took off his cotton coat and lay down next to the squad leader. Ah, so soft, so comfortable! The straw gave off a fragrant aroma, sweet and refreshing. He stretched and felt a slight ache in his muscles. He had been working hard all day during the intense exercise, repeatedly shifting the artillery positions, digging fortifications, pushing cannons, and transporting shells, always taking the lead. The soldiers said:
“It's really strange, Comrade Lao Yang is old and thin, but he moves even more nimbly than us young people!” At the time, he proudly said, “Of course, I’m not an old man at all!” Now he chuckled to himself: Lao Yang, Lao Yang, has he really become an old man? Not necessarily! Thinking this, he gradually drifted into a drowsy state.

Suddenly, something jolted him awake from his slumber: It's been three days of field exercises, why hasn't the squad leader assigned me to guard duty for the first two nights? He didn't say anything tonight either, could there be a reason? Thinking, he threw off the covers and sat up. The squad leader beside him was still awake. "Comrade Lao Yang, why are you getting up?" "Comrade Squad Leader, do I have guard duty tonight?" "No, you just rest." "Why haven't I been assigned guard duty for three days in a row?" The squad leader paused, then said, "It's not that you aren't assigned, it just hasn't been our squad's turn these past few days." With that, he yawned and turned over to sleep.

Comrade Lao Yang lay down, but he couldn't shake off his unease. He thought: There's a loophole in the squad leader's words. The company is out on field exercises, with fewer personnel and heavy tasks, how could it not be our squad's turn to stand guard? He must have been hiding it from me the first two nights, quietly taking my shift while I was snoring away. This is terrible! It can't happen like that tonight! Tonight, I'll lie here without blinking, and see what the squad leader does. Having made up his mind, he lay in the darkness with his eyes wide open, waiting quietly. All around him was the sound of snoring, the soldiers were sleeping soundly.

After half an hour, there was still no movement. Comrade Lao Yang was finding it hard to hold on, his eyelids felt heavy, but he persevered. Another half hour passed, and sure enough, the squad leader switched on his flashlight, checked his watch, and threw off the covers, getting up. He hadn't even taken off his cotton coat! He tiptoed to the end of the hallway near the door and patted a soldier: "Get up, it's our turn to take over!" The soldier mumbled something, turned over, and fell back asleep. Comrade Lao Yang saw all of this clearly. Smiling inwardly, he quickly put on his cotton coat, slung his rifle over his shoulder, and walked behind the squad leader: "Comrade Squad Leader, let him sleep a little longer, I'll take this shift!"

The squad leader quickly turned his head: "Hey, Comrade Lao Yang, why are you awake?" "I haven't been sleeping at all!" "Aiya! You really are--" "Comrade Squad Leader, don't be like that, what kind of soldier doesn't stand guard? Wouldn't that make me a special soldier?" The squad leader thought for a moment, then helplessly shook his head: "Alright, let's go!"

The two of them pushed open the door and went outside. The outside was full of dew and moonlight. The night wind was chilly. The squad leader quickly put the cotton overcoat in his hand over Comrade Lao Yang.

II.

The sentry post was set up on the bank of a small river at the east end of the village. In front was a river beach and groves of trees, behind was a harvested rice field where all the company's vehicles and artillery were parked. Comrade Lao Yang, draped in the cotton overcoat and holding his rifle, patrolled back and forth in the moonlight, watching in all directions and listening intently. He was a very good sentry.

Soon after he took up his post, he saw someone walking over from the artillery vehicle area. He recognized the driver of vehicle number five, Chen Hesheng. He saw him pacing back and forth along the riverbank, walking and stopping, as if something was on his mind. Comrade Lao Yang found it strange: Soldiers usually fall asleep as soon as they lie down, and sleep soundly until morning. The company is the best hospital for treating insomnia. Even my old insomnia has been cured in the ten days since I joined the company. Why would this young man suddenly have insomnia, getting up in the middle of the night to wander in the moonlight?

Thinking this, Comrade Lao Yang couldn't help but worry about Xiao Chen: This young man must have some ideological knot that he can't untie, making him unable to sleep. But what could be the problem? Xiao Chen is a cheerful, lively young man of twenty. During combined training, he drove the vehicle to the position and even volunteered to help the artillerymen push the cannon and pass shells, doing it more enthusiastically than anyone else. Whenever he had free time, he would shout and run over: "Comrade Lao Yang, tell me a story about the Long March!" Or: "How did the September 18th Incident begin?" He loves to ask and listen to everything, what ideological problem could he have? ... Suddenly, Comrade Lao Yang remembered something Xiao Chen said when the artillery vehicle was crossing the river during the day: "After crossing the river, it's only fifty li to my hometown!" That's right, this young man is probably homesick! The moonlight is so good tonight, "I raise my head and gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown," especially since he is so close to home. Right, tomorrow I must find an opportunity to talk to him and comfort him. Doesn't he love to hear stories? I'll tell him the story of an Eighth Route Army political commissar who passed his home three times without entering...

III.

The moon hung in the mid-sky, and the dew on the grass gradually turned into white frost. The squad leader brought the third squad of sentries to relieve the guard, Comrade Lao Yang introduced the situation, and walked back with the squad leader. On the way he thought: I should report Chen Hesheng's insomnia to the squad leader, and ask for his opinion on how to help him. So he stopped the squad leader and softly recounted the situation.

The squad leader initially wanted to laugh, but later he was suddenly moved, grabbed Comrade Lao Yang's hand, and exclaimed: "Comrade Lao Yang, you really care about our soldiers!" Lao Yang said: "Let's discuss a way to help him!" The squad leader laughed again: "Comrade Lao Yang, do you know what his ideological problem is? Speaking of which, it has something to do with you!"

"Has something to do with me?" Comrade Lao Yang was taken aback, and quickly grabbed the squad leader, wanting to know the details. The squad leader had no choice but to tell the truth about what happened.

It turned out that when the squad leader brought Comrade Lao Yang to the sentry post, he was very worried when he assigned the task and walked back: The terrain here is complex, and it's dark at night, what if something happens? He was planning to go back and wake up the deputy squad leader to discuss a solution, when suddenly he tripped over a tin bucket, making a "thump" sound that startled him. He had already walked to the artillery vehicle.

The driver of vehicle number five, Chen Hesheng, was sleeping in the carriage, and was awakened by the sound of the tin bucket. "Who's there?" "It's me." "Vehicle commander, is it my turn to stand guard?" "Not yet. It's not your shift tonight, Comrade Lao Yang is on the second shift."

"Aren't you not going to ask him to stand guard?" "If we don't ask him to stand guard, he'll stay up all night waiting, what can we do?" Chen Hesheng jumped up and got dressed. "Vehicle commander, I don't think this is right. Field exercises are not the same as in the barracks. This is a remote mountainous area, we must pay attention to Comrade Lao Yang's safety!" The squad leader frowned and said: "I'm worried about this too."

Chen Hesheng quickly put on his clothes and jumped out of the vehicle. "Vehicle commander, leave this to me, I'll stand guard for him!" With that, he ran towards the riverbank, which is why he got up in the middle of the night to wander in the moonlight.

After Comrade Lao Yang finished listening, he stamped his feet repeatedly and said: "Aiya, what are you two doing! I am myself a sentry, and you're sending me another sentry! Comrade Squad Leader, don't treat me like a leader!" The squad leader said: "We didn't treat you like a leader, but what if--" Comrade Lao Yang quickly interrupted him: "What if? I have a rifle in my hand, what am I afraid of? You are really too worried about me!"

IV.

The next night, the troops camped under a tea mountain, and the moonlight was still good. Before going to sleep, Comrade Lao Yang talked with the young driver for a long time. Comrade Lao Yang told several stories, even the story of the old political commissar who passed his home three times without entering for the sake of the revolution. Before parting, Comrade Lao Yang said with a smile to the young driver: "Xiao Chen, we've agreed, next time I'm on guard, you're not allowed to be a 'sentry's sentry' again!"

    两个哨兵
    章明	一
    野营演习的第三天晚上，炮兵团三连宿营在一个村庄里。熄灯哨吹过了，明亮的月光从纸窗透进农舍的穿堂，照着睡在地铺上的战士们。
    下放当兵的杨师长脱了棉衣，挨着班长躺了下来。呵，这样柔软，这样舒服！稻草发出一阵阵的香味，甜丝丝的，清幽幽的。他伸了一个懒腰，感到浑身的筋骨有些酸疼。白天紧张地演习了一整天，大炮再三的变换阵地，挖工事、推炮、运炮弹，他都抢在头前。战士们说：
  “也真怪，老杨同志年纪大，身板瘦，动作可比我们年青人还麻利！”当时他很自豪地说：“当然罗，我根本就不是老头子！”现在他暗自笑了笑：老杨呀老杨，难道真的成了老头子吗？不见得吧！想到这里，他渐渐地睡意蒙胧起来。
    忽然，一件事情把他从蒙胧里惊醒：出来野营三天了，为什么头两夜班长没有派我站岗？今晚上他又没有交代，莫非其中有原故？想着，他一掀被子坐了起来。班长在旁边还没有睡着。“老杨同志，你怎么起来了？”“班长同志，今晚上有我的岗吗？”“没有，你安心睡吧。”“怎么一连三天都不派我站岗呢？”班长停了一下，说：“不是不派你，这几天还没摊到咱们班哩。”说着，他打了呵欠，翻过身去睡了。
    老杨同志躺下来，却放心不下。他想：班长的话里有漏洞。连队出来野营，人员少，任务重，怎么摊不上咱们班站岗呢？头两夜准是瞒着我，当我睡得呼呼地，人家悄悄地替我把岗站了。这多糟糕！今晚上可不能那样了！今晚上我不眨眼地躺在这里，看看你班长有什么动作。主意打定，他就在黑暗里睁大眼静静地等着。耳边是一片鼾声，战士们睡得十分香甜。
    过了半个多钟头，还没有什么动静，老杨同志有些撑不住了，眼皮子直发涩，但他还是坚持着。又过了半点钟，果然，班长拧开了手电，看了看表，一掀被子站了起来。原来他根本没有脱棉衣！只见他蹑手蹑脚地走到穿堂靠门的那头，拍拍一个战士：“起来吧，该咱们接岗啦！”那个战士嘴里咕哝了句什么，翻了一个身，又睡着了。这一切老杨同志都看得真切。他一面暗笑着，一面飞快地穿上棉衣，背上大枪，走到班长背后：“班长同志，让他多睡一会儿，我站这一班！”
    班长连忙一扭脸：“哎，老杨同志，你怎么醒了？”“我根本也没有睡呀！”“咳！你真是——”“班长同志，你别这样，当兵还有不站岗的吗？那不成了个特殊兵啦？”班长想了想，无可奈何地摇摇头：“好吧，我们走！”
    两个人推开门走了出去。外面是满天的露水，满地的月光。夜风吹在身上凉飕飕的。班长连忙把手里的棉大衣给老杨同志披上。	二
    哨位设在村东头的小河岸上，前面是河滩和杂树林子，后面是一片收割了的稻田，全连的汽车和火炮就停放在稻田里。老杨同志披着棉大衣，端着枪，在月光下面来回巡视着，眼观六路，耳听八方，他是一个很好的哨兵。
    他上岗不久，就看见从炮车那边走过来一个人，一看，原来是五号汽车的小司机陈禾生。只见他一个人在河边一趟一趟地蹓跶着，走走又停停，好像有什么心事似的。老杨同志觉得奇怪：战士们都是一躺下就睡着，一觉到天亮的。连队是治疗失眠症的最好的医院，连我这个老失眠患者，下连来十多天就给治好了，为什么这个小伙子突然失了眠，半夜里爬起来，在月亮地里徘徊起来了？
    想到这里，老杨同志不禁替小陈担起心来：这小伙子一定是有什么思想疙瘩解不开，弄得睡不着觉了。可这会是什么问题呢？小陈是个好说好笑，活蹦乱跳的二十岁的小青年，在合练当中，把汽车开到了阵地，还主动地帮炮手推炮，递炮弹，干得比谁都欢。一有空，就叫嚷着跑过来：“老杨同志，讲个万里长征的故事吧！”或者就是：“九一八事变是怎么开头的？”什么他都爱问爱听，他会有什么思想问题呢？……，忽然，老杨同志想起了白天炮车渡河的时候小陈说的一句话：“过了河，离我家乡只有五十里路了！”对了，这小伙子可能是想起家来了！今晚上月光又好，“举头望明月，低头思故乡”，何况离家又这么近。对，明天我一定找个机会跟他谈谈，安慰安慰他。他不是爱听故事吗？我就把八路军的一个老政委三过家门而不入的故事讲给他听……	三
    月亮挂在中天，草叶上的露水渐渐凝成白霜。班长带了第三班哨兵来换岗，老杨同志介绍了情况，就和班长一道往回走。在路上他想：我应该把陈禾生失眠的情况给班长汇报一下，该怎么进行帮助，也征求一下他的意见。于是他喊住了班长，轻声地把方才的情况说了一遍。
    班长开始听了直想笑，可是听到后来他忽然一阵感动，拉住了老杨同志的手，喊道：“老杨同志，你可真关心我们士兵呵！”老杨说：“我们商量一个办法帮助他吧！”班长又笑了起来：“老杨同志，你知道他是什么思想问题？说起来，还跟你有点儿关系哩！”
    “跟我有关系？”老杨同志吃了一惊，连忙拉住班长要问个究竟。班长没有办法，只好把这件事的来由照实说了出来。
    原来，班长把老杨同志带到哨位上，交代了任务往回走的时候，心里很是放心不下：这里地形复杂，又是黑夜里，万一出了事情怎么办？他正盘算着回去把副班长叫醒了商量一个办法，忽然脚下绊翻了一个洋铁桶，“嗵”的一声，把他吓了一跳。他已经走到炮车旁边来了。
    第五号汽车的小司机陈禾生在车厢里睡觉，叫洋铁桶的响声惊醒了。“谁？”“我。”“炮车长，该我站岗了吗？”“还早呢。今晚你轮不上了，老杨同志站第二班。”
  “不是不叫他站吗？”“不叫他站，他就一夜不睡等着，有什么办法？”陈禾生一骨碌爬了起来：“炮车长，我看这不行，野营不比在营房，这里荒山野地的，我们要注意老杨同志的安全呀！”班长皱着眉说：“我正为这犯愁呢。”
    陈禾生连忙穿好衣服，跳下车来。“炮车长，你把这件事交给我吧，我给他放个哨！”说着他就朝河滩那边跑去，这就是他半夜里爬起来在月下徘徊的原因。
    老杨同志听完了，连连跌足说：“咳，你们两个这是干什么！我自己就是一个哨兵，你们又给我派了一个哨兵！班长同志，不要把我当首长看待嘛！”班长说：“我们没有把你当首长，可是万一——”老杨同志连忙截住他：“万一？我哨兵手里有枪，还怕什么？你们真是为我过于操心啦！”	四
    第二天晚上，部队在一座茶山下面露营，月光仍旧很好。在睡觉之前，老杨同志跟小司机谈了很长时间。老杨同志讲了好几个故事，就连那个老政委为革命三过其门而不入的故事也讲了。临分手的时候，老杨同志笑着对小司机说：“小陈，我们说好了，下次我站岗，可不许你再给我当‘哨兵的哨兵’了！”（附图片）
