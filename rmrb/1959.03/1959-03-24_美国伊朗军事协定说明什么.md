What Does the U.S.-Iran Military Agreement Indicate?
Wei Daoxu

The long-brewing U.S.-Iran military agreement, together with the U.S. military agreements with Turkey and Pakistan, was formally signed on March 5 in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. These three agreements are aggressive agreements by which U.S. imperialism patches up the Baghdad Pact, openly replaces Britain's position, and attempts to place the member states of the Baghdad Pact organization in the Middle East under its direct and strict control. U.S. imperialism vainly attempts to suppress the Iranian people and the national independence movement in the Middle East by colluding with the Iranian dynasty in a dirty manner, turning Iran into a center for threatening the Soviet Union and plotting to subvert the Republic of Iraq. This agreement openly allows the United States to send troops to occupy Iran in the event of direct or indirect "aggression" against Iran. Obviously, the United States hopes to further place Iran under strict U.S. military control through the U.S.-Iran military agreement, to make Iran serve U.S. aggression in the Middle East, to pave the way for U.S. monopoly capital to invade Iran, and to drag the Iranian people into the abyss of national disaster.

Baghdad Pact Revived

As early as July 1958, Dulles, at the Baghdad Pact Organization Council meeting in London, proposed concluding bilateral military agreements with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. This was because the heroic Iraqi people overthrew the rule of the Faisal dynasty and established the Republic of Iraq, which left the Baghdad Pact Organization in a state of disintegration. In order to adhere to the "cold war" and "brinkmanship" policies that endanger peace in the Middle East and the world, the U.S. ruling clique attempted to maintain the Baghdad Pact Organization and further turn the three countries of Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran into U.S. bases for aggression.

The United States has already established a series of military bases in Iran, built many warehouses for storing hydrogen bombs and hydrogen weapons, and formed a U.S. missile base network with its spearhead pointing to southern Soviet Union.

The Iranian reactionary government's policy of hostility towards the Soviet Union has been fully exposed in the recent Soviet-Iranian negotiations. Under the strong pressure of the Iranian people, the Iranian government had to feign an initiative in January of this year to sign a treaty of friendship, non-aggression, and cooperation with the Soviet Union. If this treaty had been successfully signed, it would have brought great benefits to Iran. However, because the Iranian ruling clique insisted on relying on the United States and suppressing domestic national revolutionary forces, the negotiations finally broke down, and Iran finally signed this bilateral military agreement with the United States, which harms the interests of the Iranian people and the people of all countries in the Middle East.

Another spearhead of the U.S.-Iran military agreement is directed at the Arab national independence movement. The United States wants to turn Iran into a center for plotting to subvert the Republic of Iraq, just as it used Iraq under the old dynasty as a center for armed intervention in Syria in the past. The Iraqi "National Newspaper" pointed out that "this agreement is not only a threat to the Soviet Union, but also a threat to the people of all countries in the Middle East, especially to the Arab people, and especially to the Iraqi people." The victory of the Iraqi revolution has had a tremendous impact on the people of all countries in the Middle East. This revolution shows that the surging national independence movement is an irresistible trend, causing further shake-ups in imperialist forces in the Middle East. Therefore, the newborn Republic of Iraq has become a thorn in the side of the imperialists.

While U.S. and British troops were forced to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, the United States sent Rountree to the Middle East to carry out activities to split Arab countries and isolate Iraq, and on the other hand, it intensified its use of the member states of the Baghdad Pact Group to carry out sabotage activities against Iraq. According to Beirut news, the United States is instigating the Kurds in Iraq to rise up against the Qasim regime. Lindquist, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Iran, "visited" the city of Resa'iyeh near the Iraqi border in October 1958, where he inspected a special sabotage group composed of Kurdish criminals. This sabotage group will be sent to Iraq to engage in sabotage activities, and the funds and weapons will be provided by the United States. The implementation of this sabotage work will be carried out strictly in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. Consulate in Kirkuk (an oil-producing area in northern Iraq). The signing of the U.S.-Iran bilateral military agreement means that the United States and the Iranian ruling clique will launch larger-scale conspiracies to oppose the Republic of Iraq and the national independence movement in the Middle East from the north.

Intensifying Military Control over Iran

The signing of the U.S.-Iran military agreement has further intensified U.S. military control over Iran. The Iranian army has a total of only over 100,000 troops, while the United States has a huge military advisory group stationed in Iran, with more than 600 military advisors alone, and no less than 4,600 officials participating in the work! This advisory group has actually become the "supreme emperor" of the Iranian army, and its claws almost reach every department of the Iranian army. They cooperated with the Iranian government to carry out "cleansing" work in the army, while at the same time placing more U.S. puppets in the Iranian army. They have almost unlimited power over the training, equipment, and stationing locations of Iranian armed forces personnel. Some Iranian officers receive monthly allowances from the Americans, and some of these officers have also formed a special organization to secretly monitor the entire Iranian army. These U.S. "representatives" in Iran are also gradually strengthening their control over Iranian security agencies, so that they can carry out activities arbitrarily in the Iranian army behind the backs of the Iranian King and his confidants.

According to Middle Eastern newspapers, the U.S.-Iran bilateral military agreement has secret annexes stipulating that the United States can station troops in Iran, including areas such as Khuzestan, Kurdistan, and some areas near the Persian Gulf. U.S. military aircraft and warships have the right to use Iranian airports and ports, and U.S. soldiers will not be subject to Iranian judicial interrogation. The secret annexes also stipulate that the United States has the right to send troops from other countries to Iran in the event of a "dangerous situation."

In order to arrange such a military agreement that enslaves the Iranian people, U.S. dignitaries have already carried out a series of activities in Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally visited Iran in early 1958, followed by Army Chief of Staff Taylor, Defense Secretary McElroy, former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey McGee, spy chief Allen Dulles, war-monger Radford, and Chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (an expert in building rocket bases) Itschner, all of whom successively went to Iran to carry out activities and held a series of secret talks with the Iranian ruling clique. The United States is building and expanding new military bases in all important strategic areas of Iran. According to Egyptian and Indian newspapers, the U.S. military bases in Iran are scattered all over the place, numbering no less than dozens.

In addition, the United States also plans to build the planned station for the Fifth Fleet in the ports of Bushehr, Shapour, and Shahbahar on the southern coast of Iran. According to U.S. Navy officials, the Iranian coast "both strategically and politically, is the most suitable area to become a new fleet base," because "no matter what happens in any coastal area of Asia and Africa, it is possible to take relative action from this area."

Monopolizing Iran's Oil Resources

The signing of the U.S.-Iran military agreement will greatly facilitate U.S. monopoly groups in seizing Iran's oil. Iran is rich in oil resources. Before the nationalization movement in 1951, its output ranked third in the capitalist world, second only to the United States and Venezuela. Iranian oil was originally under the control of British oil monopoly capital. From 1920, U.S. oil capitalists began to try to get involved in Iranian oil enterprises, but due to Britain's strong resistance, they could not get what they wanted. In 1951, the United States took advantage of the turmoil caused by the Iranian oil nationalization movement to fish in troubled waters and forced Iran to accept the proposal to establish an international oil consortium, grabbing 40% of Iran's oil exploitation rights from Britain out of thin air. This, of course, was far from satisfying the insatiable desires of the U.S. oil bosses, whose goal was to completely squeeze British and other countries' oil companies out of Iran.

In order to achieve this goal, the United States spent $7 million in early 1958 to plot a coup in Iran, supporting Ali Amini, the then Iranian ambassador to the United States, who was more appreciated by U.S. oil monopoly organizations, to come to power. Amini had established connections with representatives of some large oil companies and U.S. intelligence agencies in the United States. He agreed that after coming to power, he would give U.S. oil companies various preferential treatments, including canceling the oil agreement signed with the Italian National Oil Company in September 1957. This agreement violated the traditional profit-sharing rate stipulated by the international oil cartel, which made the U.S. oil bosses feel very indignant.

Before the signing of the U.S.-Iran military agreement, the giants of the U.S. big oil monopoly organizations held a meeting in Los Angeles to discuss the possible benefits that the U.S.-Iran military agreement could bring to U.S. oil companies. The number one boss of the oil empire, Rockefeller, the owner of "New Jersey Mobil Oil Company," personally came to participate in the meeting. From the speeches of the oil giants who participated in the meeting, it can be seen that the U.S. oil monopoly organization has already reached an agreement with the Pentagon in Washington that, according to the agreement, the Persian Gulf region, which is the most abundant in Iranian oil, will be declared a strategic area in the future, prohibiting all non-American foreigners from engaging in activities.

Oil is the economic lifeline of Iran. After the United States monopolizes Iranian oil, it can further control the Iranian economy. According to the figures published by the international oil cartel itself, the international oil consortium extracted nearly $500 million (half of which is supposed to go to the Iranian government) from Iran in 1958. This figure is more than half of Iran's national budget for 1957-58. According to the Iranian King himself, Iran will be able to obtain $1 billion in taxes annually in ten years. That is to say, in ten years, the international oil consortium will be able to extract about seven times more staggering profits from the Iranian people than the Iranian national budget for 1957-58!

In addition to oil monopoly capital, other U.S. monopoly organizations have also begun to invade Iran. The "Hawaiian Sugar Company" and "Parsons Company" of the U.S. Western Consortium have already monopolized Iran's sugar industry. Iran's seven-year agricultural development plan is also being implemented by the "Development and Resources Corporation" of New York on behalf of the Iranian government. The Kerman region in Iran, which is rich in chromium and coal, will be exclusively operated by the "Kerman Development Company" composed of U.S. monopoly capital.

The Iranian People Will Surely Be Masters of Their Own Affairs

Because of the U.S. imperialism's collusion with the Iranian feudal dynasty to exploit the Iranian people, the Iranian people are in dire straits. Since Iran joined the Baghdad Pact, it has been burdened with increasingly heavy military expenditures. In 1958-59, military expenditures accounted for 40% of the budget, reaching 11.43 billion rials (76 rials equal to one U.S. dollar), more than double that of 1954-55, and almost six and a half times more than that of 1946-47. Huge military expenditures have brought a huge deficit to Iran's finances. The deficit in 1955-56 was 2.7 billion rials, and it reached more than 4 billion in 1956-57, and the actual figures were far more than that. According to Iranian economists, the deficit in 1955-56 was 6 billion instead of 2.7 billion rials. Iran's national debt reached a staggering 34.3 billion rials by the end of 1957!

There are 1,084 foreign companies in Iran, and they, like poisonous snakes, occupy every economic sector in Iran, extracting a staggering profit of 100 million pounds from the Iranian people every year. These companies import 25 billion rials of various foreign commodities into Iran every year, which has dealt a fatal blow to Iran's national industry, thereby bringing a huge trade deficit to Iran. In 1955-56, Iran's trade deficit was 15.94 billion rials, 12.16 billion in 1956-57, and 16.9 billion in 1957-58. Huge military expenditures, soaring financial deficits, and heavy debts have made Iran impoverished, and the lives of the vast working people are even more miserable. From 1953-57, Iran's cost of living index rose by 39%, while the purchasing power of the rial fell by 30% from 1951-55. At the same time, the Iranian people have suffered increasingly severe political persecution. Progressive forces have been brutally destroyed, progressive parties have been declared illegal for no reason, and thousands of workers and patriotic people have been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps, subjected to inhuman torture. In May 1958, the Iranian ruling class blatantly disregarded the just condemnation of world public opinion and secretly executed the leader of the Iranian People's Party, Khosrow Rouzbeh.

However, no matter how ferocious imperialism and feudal forces are, they cannot scare the Iranian people. The Iranian working people, under the leadership of the working class, have a glorious tradition of struggle. From the first day that imperialist forces began to invade Iran in the early 19th century, they have launched irreconcilable struggles with the enemy. As early as 1921, Iranian oil workers held a major strike to oppose the exploitation of British imperialism. On May 1, 1946, under the leadership of the Iranian trade union organization, a nationwide demonstration of 700,000 people was held. On July 14, 1946, more than 100,000 oil workers in Abadan held a world-shaking strike. The workers fought with their bare hands against the enemies who came to suppress them, and more than 200 people were killed or injured. In early 1951, another 50,000 oil workers held a major strike, and at the same time, 70,000 people held an anti-American demonstration in Isfahan. With the increasing awareness of the people, the Iranian people's will to struggle is also becoming more and more firm. In 1951, a climax of the oil nationalization movement was launched throughout Iran. In 1953 alone, more than 200 strikes were held throughout Iran.

The Iranian people are a people with revolutionary traditions. The evil activities of imperialism and the domestic reactionary ruling clique in Iran can only make the Iranian people more united and determined to carry out the struggle. Military agreements, bases, missiles, and other conspiracies cannot stop the development and growth of the Iranian people and the people of all countries in the Middle East. The doomsday of the Saeed government of the Iraqi dynasty awaits the current reactionary dynasty rule in Iran.

    美国伊朗军事协定说明什么
    卫道煦
    酝酿已久的美国伊朗军事协定，已与美国同土耳其和巴基斯坦的军事协定一起，于3月5日在土耳其首都安卡拉正式签字。这三个协定是美帝国主义补缀巴格达条约，公开取代英国地位，想把中东地区的巴格达条约组织成员国置于自己直接的、严密的控制之下的侵略协定。美帝国主义妄想用和伊朗王朝勾结的肮脏办法来镇压伊朗人民和中东民族独立运动，把伊朗变为威胁苏联和阴谋颠复伊拉克共和国的活动中心。这个协定公然允许美国在伊朗遭受直接或间接“侵略”时出兵占领伊朗。显然，美国是希望通过美伊军事协定进一步置伊朗于美国严密的军事控制之下，使伊朗为美国对中东的侵略活动效劳，为美国垄断资本侵入伊朗铺平道路，把伊朗人民拖进民族灾难的深渊。
    巴格达条约借尸还魂
    早在1958年7月，杜勒斯在伦敦召开的巴格达条约组织理事会上，就提出要和伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦缔结双边军事协定。这是因为英勇的伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔王朝的统治，成立了伊拉克共和国后，使得巴格达条约组织陷于支离破碎的境地。美国统治集团为了坚持奉行危害中东和世界和平的“冷战”和“战争边缘”政策，企图借此维持巴格达条约组织，并进一步把土、巴、伊三国变为美国的侵略基地。
    美国已经在伊朗建立了一系列军事基地，修建了很多贮存氢弹和氢武器的仓库，形成了一个矛头指向苏联南部的美国导弹基地网。
    伊朗反动政府敌视苏联的政策，已在最近苏伊谈判中暴露无遗。在伊朗人民的强大压力下，伊朗政府不得不在今年1月假意提出倡议，要和苏联签订友好、互不侵犯和合作条约。这一条约如果签订成功，会给伊朗带来莫大好处。但是由于伊朗统治集团一意依靠美国，镇压国内民族革命力量，谈判终告破裂，伊朗最后和美国签订了这个损害伊朗人民利益和中东各国人民利益的双边军事协定。
    美伊军事协定的另一矛头是指向阿拉伯民族独立运动。美国想把伊朗变为阴谋颠复伊拉克共和国的活动中心，就像它过去利用旧王朝统治下的伊拉克作为武装干涉叙利亚的中心一样。伊拉克“国家报”指出，“这个协定不仅是对苏联的威胁，而且也是对中东各国人民的威胁，特别是对阿拉伯人民的威胁，尤其是对伊拉克人民的威胁。”伊拉克革命的胜利在中东各国人民中产生了巨大的影响。这个革命说明了风起云涌的民族独立运动是一股不可阻挡的潮流，使帝国主义势力在中东发生进一步的动摇。因此，新生的伊拉克共和国便成了帝国主义者的眼中钉。
    在美英军队被迫撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的同时，美国一方面派出了朗特里去中东进行活动，分裂阿拉伯国家，孤立伊拉克；另一方面也加紧利用巴格达条约集团成员国，对伊拉克进行破坏活动。据贝鲁特消息透露，美国正在策动伊拉克的库尔德人起来反对卡塞姆政权。美国驻伊朗军事顾问团团长林德奎斯特在1958年10月“访问”了靠近伊拉克国界的雷萨埃城，在那里视察了由库尔德人犯罪分子组成的特别破坏集团。这个破坏集团将被派往伊拉克从事破坏活动，经费和武器都由美国供给。这项破坏工作的进行将严格按照美国驻基尔库克（伊拉克北部产油区）领事馆的指示进行。美国—伊朗双边军事协定的签订，意味着美国和伊朗统治集团将更大规模地展开从北面反对伊拉克共和国和中东民族独立运动的阴谋活动。
    加紧对伊朗的军事控制
    美伊军事协定的签订，使美国更进一步加紧了对伊朗的军事控制。伊朗陆军总共只有十多万人，而美国却在伊朗驻有一个庞大的军事顾问团，单是军事顾问就有六百多人，参加工作的官员不下四千六百人！这个顾问团实际上成了伊朗军队的太上皇，它的魔爪几乎触及伊朗军队中的每一个部门。他们协同伊朗政府在陆军中进行“清洗”工作，同时却把更多的美国傀儡安插到伊朗军队中去。他们对伊朗武装部队人员的训练、装备和驻扎地点等等几乎握有无限的权力。有一些伊朗军官每月向美国人领取津贴，其中一部分军官还成立了一个特别组织，对整个伊朗军队进行暗中监督。美国在伊朗的这些“代表”还正在逐步加强对伊朗保安机关的控制，从而使他们可以背着伊朗国王和他的亲信，在伊朗军队中肆意进行活动。
    据中东报刊透露，美国和伊朗的双边军事协定附有秘密附件，规定美国可以在伊朗驻军，驻军地区包括胡泽斯坦、库尔德斯坦和靠近波斯湾的一些地区。美国军用飞机和舰只有权使用伊朗的飞机场和港口，美国军人将不受伊朗司法的审讯。秘密附件还规定，美国在一旦产生“危险局势”的情况下，有权把其他国家的军队也派到伊朗去。
    为了安排这样一个奴役伊朗人民的军事协定，美国的达官显贵，早已在伊朗进行了一系列的活动。美国国务卿杜勒斯于1958年初亲自访问了伊朗，接着陆军参谋长泰勒、国防部长麦克耳罗伊、前美国驻土耳其大使麦吉、特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯、战争贩子雷德福、美国陆军工兵处处长（修建火箭基地的专家）伊特希纳等人，都先后到伊朗进行活动，并和伊朗统治集团进行一系列秘密会谈。美国正在伊朗的一切重要战略地区修建和扩建新的军事基地。据埃及和印度报刊揭露，美国在伊朗的军事基地星罗棋布，大小不下数十处之多。
    此外，美国还计划在伊朗南部海岸的布什尔、沙普尔和沙赫巴哈尔等港口修建拟议中的第五舰队的驻扎地。据美国海军负责人谈，伊朗海岸“无论从战略上和从政治上来说，都是成为新舰队基地的最合适地区”，因为“亚非任何沿海地区不管发生什么情况，都有可能从这个地区采取相对的行动”。
    垄断伊朗石油资源
    美伊军事协定的签订，将为美国垄断集团霸占伊朗石油大开方便之门。伊朗石油资源丰富，1951年国有化运动前，产量在资本主义世界中仅次于美国和委内瑞拉，而居第三位。伊朗石油原来是在英国石油垄断资本控制之下，1920年起，美国石油大资本家就开始想插足伊朗石油企业，但由于英国的竭力抵制，未能为所欲为。1951年美国利用伊朗石油国有化运动发生的动乱，混水摸鱼，强迫伊朗接受成立国际石油财团的建议，从英国手中平空攫取了40％的伊朗石油开采权。这当然还远不能满足美国石油大老板贪得无厌的欲望，他们的目标是要把英国和其他国家的石油公司完全从伊朗排挤出去。
    为了达到这一目的，美国曾在1958年初，花了七百万美元，阴谋在伊朗发动一次政变，扶持更为美国石油垄断组织所赏识的当时伊朗驻美大使阿里·阿米尼上台。阿米尼在美国和一些大石油公司代表以及美国特务机关都建立了联系，他同意上台后将给予美国石油公司种种优惠，包括取消1957年9月和意大利国家石油公司签订的石油协定。这个协定违反了国际石油卡特尔传统规定的利润对分率，曾使美国石油大老板们感到非常愤慨。
    美伊军事协定签订前，美国大石油垄断组织的巨头们曾在洛杉矶开会，讨论美伊军事协定给美国石油公司可能带来的好处。石油帝国的第一号头子、“新泽西美孚油公司”老板洛克菲勒亲自出马参加了这次会议。从参加会议的石油巨头们的发言中可以看出，美国石油垄断组织已经和华盛顿五角大楼谈妥，根据协定，伊朗石油最丰富的波斯湾地区今后将被宣布为战略地区，禁止一切非美国的外国人从事活动。
    石油是伊朗的经济命脉，美国垄断伊朗石油后就可以进一步控制伊朗经济。据国际石油卡特尔自己公布的数字，1958年国际石油财团从伊朗榨取了将近五亿美元（其中一半按规定归伊朗政府）的惊人利润。这个数字比伊朗1957—58年的国家预算还要多出一半多。据伊朗国王自己称，十年后伊朗每年将可获得十亿美元的税收。那就是说，十年后，国际石油财团每年将可从伊朗人民身上榨取约比1957—58年伊朗国家预算大七倍多的惊人利润！
    除了石油垄断资本外，美国的其他垄断组织也开始侵入伊朗，美国西部财团的“夏威夷糖公司”和“巴逊氏公司”已经垄断了伊朗的制糖业。伊朗的农业发展七年计划，也是由纽约的“开发与资源公司”代表伊朗政府执行的。伊朗盛产铬和煤的基尔曼地区，将由美国垄断资本组成的“基尔曼开发公司”独揽经营。
    伊朗人民必将当家作主
    由于美帝国主义勾结伊朗封建王朝对伊朗人民进行压榨，伊朗人民正处于水深火热之中。伊朗参加巴格达条约以来，它背负着日益沉重的军事开支。1958—59年，军事开支占预算的40％，达一百一十四点三亿里亚尔（七十六里亚尔等于一美元），比1954—55年增加一倍多，而比1946—47年几乎增加了六倍半。巨额的军费开支给伊朗财政带来了庞大的赤字。1955—56年赤字为二十七亿里亚尔，1956—57年达四十亿以上，而实际数字还远不止于此。据伊朗经济学家的估计，1955—56年的赤字是六十亿而不是二十七亿里亚尔。伊朗国债到1957年底已达三百四十三亿里亚尔的惊人数字！
    伊朗有一千零八十四家外国公司，它们就像毒蛇一样盘据在伊朗每个经济部门中，每年从伊朗人民身上榨取一亿英镑的惊人利润。这些公司每年向伊朗输入二百五十亿里亚尔的各种外国商品，使伊朗民族工业受到致命打击，从而给伊朗带来了巨大的贸易赤字。1955—56年伊朗贸易赤字为一百五十九点四亿里亚尔，1956—57年为一百二十一点六亿，1957—58年达一百六十九亿。军事开支浩大、财政赤字激增、债台高筑，使伊朗民穷财尽，广大劳动人民生活更是苦不堪言。1953—57年，伊朗生活指数上升了39％，而里亚尔的购买力从1951—55年却下降了30％。与此同时，伊朗人民遭受到的政治迫害也是有加无已。进步力量惨遭摧毁，进步政党无故被宣布为非法，成千上万的工人和爱国志士被关进监狱和集中营，受到惨无人道的酷刑的折磨。1958年5月，伊朗统治阶级悍然不顾世界舆论的正义谴责，秘密处死了伊朗人民党领袖豪斯劳·鲁兹贝赫。
    但是，不管帝国主义和封建势力如何凶狠，它们是吓不倒伊朗人民的。伊朗劳动人民在工人阶级领导下，有光荣的斗争传统，他们从十九世纪初帝国主义势力开始侵入伊朗的第一天起，就和敌人展开了不调和的斗争。早在1921年伊朗石油工人就举行过大罢工，反对英帝国主义的压榨。1946年5月1日，在伊朗工会组织的领导下，举行了全国有七十万人参加的示威大游行。1946年7月14日，阿巴丹十多万石油工人举行了震动全世界的大罢工，工人们赤手空拳和前来镇压他们的敌人展开流血斗争，死伤两百多人。1951年初又有五万石油工人举行大罢工，同时在伊斯法罕有七万人举行了反美示威大游行。随着人民觉悟的日益提高，伊朗人民的斗争意志也日益坚决。1951年伊朗全国掀起了石油国有化运动高潮。单是1953年一年，伊朗全国就举行过二百多次的罢工。
    伊朗人民是具有革命传统的人民。帝国主义和伊朗国内反动统治集团的罪恶活动，只能使伊朗人民更加团结一致，坚决进行斗争。军事协定、基地、导弹以及其他阴谋诡计，都阻止不了伊朗人民和中东各国人民力量的发展壮大。伊拉克王朝赛义德政府的末日，等待着现在的伊朗反动王朝统治。
