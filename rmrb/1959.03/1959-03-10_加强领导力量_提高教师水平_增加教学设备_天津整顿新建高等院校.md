Strengthening Leadership, Improving Teacher Quality, and Increasing Teaching Equipment
Tianjin Rectifies Newly Built Institutions of Higher Learning

(Our dispatch) Tianjin is actively rectifying and consolidating the sixteen newly built institutions of higher learning established during last year's Great Leap Forward.

These sixteen institutions include different types such as engineering, teacher training, medicine, and physical education, with a total of more than 10,000 students. Their characteristics are diligence and thrift, and the students have relatively good political quality. Since the establishment of these schools, they have achieved considerable success in implementing the Party's education policy. However, due to the urgent need to adapt to the objective situation, these newly built institutions generally underwent only a short period of preparation and then took on the task of cultivating talents based on the principle of making do with whatever was available. Therefore, some institutions do not have perfect teaching equipment, lack teachers, and have incomplete cadre allocation. There are also duplications or inadequacies in school and major settings, which to some extent affect the quality of teaching.

In response to these new problems arising in the newly built institutions of higher learning, the focus of this rectification and consolidation is to make appropriate adjustments according to the current needs of national construction, to merge some institutions and majors with overlapping settings, and to add some urgently needed institutions and majors, especially focusing on the development of higher normal colleges. At the same time, cadres and teachers have been appropriately allocated to the original institutions with incomplete cadre allocation and insufficient teachers, and teaching equipment has been added.

Now, most institutions have established Party committees, equipped with full-time Party committee secretaries and general branch and branch secretaries, strengthening the Party's leadership. In terms of administrative cadres, they have also allocated main responsible cadres such as presidents and department heads. The provincial and municipal Party committees have also selected a group of capable veteran cadres and experienced experts to take on the leadership of these newly built institutions. For example, Li Zhongyuan, Director and Party Group Secretary of the Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical Bureau, concurrently serves as the President of Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical College, and the Tianjin Construction Engineering Bureau has also transferred Yan Ziheng, Deputy Director and veteran construction engineer, to Tianjin Construction College as President. Tianjin Chemical Engineering College, Construction College, Normal College and other institutions have also strengthened collective leadership and established school affairs committees, so that the various tasks of the school have begun to move onto the right track.

Various institutions have also taken various measures to solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers. On the one hand, existing well-established institutions of higher learning, such as Tianjin University, Nankai University, Tianjin Normal University, and Tianjin Medical University, are promoting the spirit of communist collaboration and supporting a group of teachers. On the other hand, the newly built institutions have also adopted methods such as studying at key schools, having old teachers mentoring apprentices, and holding teacher training classes to cultivate teachers through self-reliance. In addition to sending more than 30 new teachers to Tianjin University, Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology and other schools for further study, Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical College also organized 87 new teachers to participate in mathematics, physics, drawing, and mechanics teacher training classes organized by the school itself. Old teachers imparted teaching experience and helped solve problems in teaching. Now some new teachers have been able to teach classes and are welcomed by students. After taking such multifaceted measures, the situation of insufficient and low-quality teachers in basic courses and professional courses has been greatly improved. Hebei Institute of Technology also adopted the method of old teachers leading new teachers, which has been very effective. Because these new teachers are eager to learn, study hard, and can carefully listen to students' opinions, they have made rapid progress.

Now, these newly built institutions of higher learning are also vigorously implementing the Party's education policy in the process of consolidating and improving, ensuring the continuous improvement of teaching quality. Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical College has revised the teaching plan in the rectification, properly arranged teaching and labor time, strengthened basic courses, and increased students' self-study time. In order to gain experience in improving teaching quality, Chen Dejun, a member of the Party Committee and Vice President, also conducted "experimental fields" in the fourth grade of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department and the Electrical Engineering Department, combining the forces of teachers, workers, and students to explore experiences in teaching, scientific research, labor, and ideological transformation. Tianjin Construction College sent people to brother institutions in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places to learn from the experience of improving teaching. On the one hand, on the other hand, it carried out a large-scale airing of views among teachers and students throughout the college, combining theoretical and practical work, studying the Party's education policy, revising the teaching plan, and closely integrating teaching, labor and scientific research on the basis of linking theory with practice. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, Hebei Institute of Technology adopted a three-way combination of teachers, students, and external forces, and through extensive airing of views and debates, drafted a draft plan for comprehensively improving teaching quality, formulated a new teaching plan, and compiled teaching outlines and part of the teaching materials for each course in the nine majors of the mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering departments.

    加强领导力量　提高教师水平　增加教学设备
    天津整顿新建高等院校
    本报讯　天津市正积极整顿巩固在去年大跃进中新建的十六所高等院校。
    这十六所院校有工科、师范、医学、体育等不同类型，共有学生一万多人，它们的特点是勤俭朴素，学生政治质量较好。这些学校成立以后，在贯彻党的教育方针方面，都取得相当的成就。但是这些新建院校由于适应客观形势的迫切需要，一般都只经过很短时期的筹备，就本着因陋就简的原则担当起了培养人才的任务。因此，有些院校在教学设备上还不够完善，师资力量不足，干部配备不齐，在学校设置和专业设置上也有重复或不够的地方，在一定程度上影响了教学质量。
    针对新建高等院校出现的这些新问题，这次整顿巩固的重点是根据当前国家建设的需要，进行适当调整，把一些院校和专业设置重复的进行合并，并且新增加一些目前迫切需要的院校和专业，特别是着重发展高等师范院校。同时，对原来干部配备不齐、师资不足的院校适当调配了干部和教师，增添了教学设备。
    现在，大部分院校都成立了党委会，配备了专职党委书记和总支、支部书记，加强了党的领导力量。在行政干部方面，也都调配了院长和系主任等主要负责干部，省、市委并且挑选了一批能力强的老干部和有经验的专家担负这些新建院校的领导工作。天津机电学院就是由天津市机电局局长、党组书记李中垣兼任院长，天津市建筑工程局也把副局长、老建筑工程师阎子亨调到天津建设学院担任院长。天津化工学院、建设学院、师范学院等院校还加强了集体领导，建立了校务委员会，使学校的各项工作都开始步入正轨。
    各院校也采取了多种办法解决师资不足的困难。一方面是由原有基础好的高等学校如天津大学、南开大学、天津师范大学、天津医科大学等学校发扬共产主义协作精神，支援一批师资。一方面新建院校也采取了到重点学校进修、老教师带徒弟、举办师资训练班等办法，自力更生培养师资。天津机电学院除了把三十多名新教师送到天津大学、清华大学、哈尔滨工业大学等校进修外，还组织了八十七名新教师分别参加学校自己举办的数学、物理、制图和力学等师资训练班，由老教师传授教学经验，帮助解决教学中的困难问题。现在有的新教师已能开课，而且受到学生的欢迎。经过这样多方采取措施以后，基础课和专业课师资不足和质量不高的情况已大为改善。河北工学院采取老教师带新教师的办法，收效也很大。由于这些新教师虚心学习，刻苦钻研，并能认真听取学生的意见，进步很快。
    现在，这些新建高等院校也正在巩固提高中大力贯彻党的教育方针，保证不断提高教学质量。天津机电学院在整顿中重新修订了教学计划，妥善安排了教学和劳动时间，并且加强了基础课，增加了学生的自学时间。为了取得提高教学质量的经验，党委委员、副院长陈德钧还在机械制造系和电机系的四年级搞了“试验田”，和教师、工人、学生的力量相结合，摸索在教学、科学研究、劳动和思想改造等方面的经验。天津建设学院一方面派人到天津、上海等地的兄弟院校吸取改进教学的经验，一方面在全院师生中开展大鸣大放，务虚和务实相结合，学习党的教育方针，修订了教学计划，在理论联系实际的基础上，使教学、劳动和科学研究紧密结合起来。河北工学院在党委的领导下，采取教师、学生和校外力量三结合的办法，通过广泛鸣放辩论，拟定了全面提高教学质量的草案，制订了新的教学计划，并编写出了机械、化工和电机三个系九个专业各门课程的教学大纲和一部分教材。　（朱泽民、黄人晓）
