Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 28th: The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) today published an "Election Appeal" in the "Akahata" newspaper, calling on the Japanese people to unite and strive for the formation of a national democratic united front and the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet in the upcoming local and House of Councillors elections. This document was adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session of the JCP Central Committee held on the 20th and 21st of this month.

The appeal pointed out: The upcoming House of Councillors and local elections are being held under the serious circumstances of the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Therefore, the struggle in this election will revolve around the following policies closely related to the fate and future path of the nation: First, should we revise the "Security Treaty," strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and choose the path of war and militarism, or should we prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," and further abolish this treaty, break away from the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and adopt a neutral policy to win peace and independence for Japan and ensure Japan's security? Second, should we follow the United States, continue to adopt a policy of hostility towards China and play the "two Chinas" conspiracy, so that relations between Japan and China can never return to normal, or should we abolish the Japan-Chiang treaty and restore diplomatic relations and trade between Japan and China? Similarly, should we no longer adopt an anti-Soviet attitude, but conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty to fully normalize relations between Japan and the Soviet Union? Third, should we agree to the United States bringing in nuclear weapons, arming the "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons, and turning Japan into a base for the United States to wage nuclear war, or should we prevent Japan from nuclear armament, establish a nuclear-free zone in Asia, and develop this zone into a zone of peace in Asia, contributing to the peace of Japan and Asia? Fourth, should we deprive the people of their democratic rights guaranteed by the Constitution, amend the Constitution, and restore a state that suppresses the people and implements reactionary politics, or should we defend democratic rights, prevent the amendment of the Constitution, and further fully implement the provisions of the Constitution concerning peace and democracy, making Japan a democratic country?

The appeal said: Whether all the difficulties faced by the Japanese people today can be resolved depends on what policies the Japanese people support and whether they unite to fight.

The appeal pointed out that, domestically, the united action of democratic forces has greatly developed, and the united front of the Japanese people for peace and independence is expanding day by day. On the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party have suffered a major blow in the struggle over the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Mistrust of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is growing in Japan, and the infighting within the Liberal Democratic Party is becoming increasingly serious.

The appeal said: Internationally, socialism has made great progress, the contradictions of capitalism are becoming increasingly acute, and U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated. This situation has created favorable conditions for the struggle of the people for peace and independence. The Japanese Communist Party now calls on the Japanese people to recognize this favorable development of the domestic and international situation and, with full confidence, strive to fight in this election, so that the united action of the people will develop in the direction of realizing current demands and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, while forming a national democratic united front.

The appeal condemned the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party for spreading the so-called "two major parties" everywhere in order to get rid of this unfavorable situation, attempting to separate the Socialist Party from the people, forcing the Communist Party to be unable to participate in political activities, thereby dividing the democratic forces and facilitating them in turning the Diet into a tool for the dictatorship of reactionary forces.

The appeal also pointed out that the Socialist Party is currently not actively fighting for the unity of all democratic forces, which is not in line with the expectations of the people.

The appeal said: The Japanese Communist Party has consistently advocated the formation of an all-people's patriotic national democratic united front. To this end, the appeal calls on the people to carry out the following struggles in this election: (1) Campaign on the basis of further developing the various struggles currently underway; (2) Develop these struggles into a united struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and abolish this treaty, to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and to strive for the realization of other demands, so that the united struggle organizations of democratic forces will further develop and expand. In the process of this struggle, make efforts to realize the unity of all democratic forces, including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

The appeal finally requested all party members to do their utmost to publicize to the masses of the people and discuss the Communist Party's policies with the masses, so that the Communist Party and the masses of the people can be integrated, and to participate in campaign activities. The appeal also called on party members to strive to always stand at the forefront of the people in the election struggle, to strive to strengthen the unity of the people and the connection between the party and the people, and to expand and strengthen the party ranks in this struggle.

    日共发表关于选举的呼吁书
    号召日本人民团结起来进行斗争
    打倒岸内阁废除日美“安全条约”
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会书记局今天在“赤旗报”上发表了“关于选举的呼吁书”，号召日本人民团结起来，在即将举行的地方选举和参议员选举中，为组成民族民主统一战线和打倒岸信介内阁而奋斗。这个文告是日共中央委员会在20和21日两日召开的第五次全体会议通过的。
    呼吁书指出：这一次的参议院选举和地方选举是在修改日美“安全条约”这样严重的形势下举行的。因此，在这次选举中将围绕着同国家的命运和前进道路息息相关的下列政策进行斗争：第一，是要修改“安全条约”，加强日美军事同盟，选择战争和军国主义的道路呢，还是要阻止“安全条约”的修改，进而废除这个条约，摆脱日美军事同盟，采取中立政策，来赢得日本的和平和独立，保障日本的安全。第二，是要追随美国，继续采取敌视中国的政策并且玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，使日中两国的关系永远不能恢复正常呢，还是要废除日蒋条约，恢复日中邦交，恢复日中贸易。同样，是否不再采取反苏的态度，而缔结日苏和约，使日苏两国关系全面正常化？第三，是要同意美国运进核武器，用核武器来武装“自卫队”，使日本变成美国进行核战争的基地呢，还是要阻止日本进行核武装，在亚洲建立禁止核武装地带，使这个地带发展成为亚洲的和平地带，对日本和亚洲的和平作出贡献。第四，是要剥夺宪法所保障的人民的民主权利，修改宪法，恢复镇压人民和实行反动政治的国家呢，还是要保卫民主权利，阻止修改宪法，进而完全实施宪法中有关和平和民主的条款，使日本成为一个民主的国家。
    呼吁书说：日本人民今天面临的一切困难能否解决，都取决于日本人民支持什么样的政策以及他们是否团结起来进行斗争。
    呼吁书指出，在国内，民主力量的联合行动有了很大的发展，日本人民争取和平和独立的统一战线正在一天天扩大，另一方面，岸信介内阁和自由民主党却在“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中受到了很大的打击，在日本国内不信任岸信介内阁的情绪正在增长，自由民主党的内哄越来越严重。
    呼吁书说：在国际上，社会主义获得了伟大的进展，资本主义的矛盾越来越尖锐，美帝国主义越来越孤立，这种形势已经为争取和平和独立的人民的斗争创造了有利的条件。日本共产党现在号召日本人民认清国内外形势的这种有利的发展，满怀信心地在这次选举中努力进行斗争，使人民的联合行动朝着实现当前的要求和打倒岸信介内阁的方向发展，同时组成民族民主统一战线。
    呼吁书谴责岸信介内阁和自由民主党为了摆脱这种不利的局面，正在到处宣传所谓“两大政党”，妄图使社会党脱离人民、迫使共产党不能参加政治活动，从而使民主力量四分五裂，便利于它们把国会变成反动势力独裁的工具。
    呼吁书还指出：社会党目前没有为一切民主力量的联合而积极进行斗争，这是不符合人民的期望的。
    呼吁书说：日本共产党一贯主张组成全民的爱国民族民主统一战线。为此，呼吁书号召人民在这次选举中进行下列斗争：（一）在进一步发展目前所进行的各方面斗争的基础上进行竞选；（二）使这些斗争发展成为一种争取阻止修改日美“安全条约”和废除这项条约、争取恢复日中邦交并且争取实现其他要求的联合斗争，使民主力量的联合斗争组织进一步发展和扩大。在这个斗争的过程中，为实现包括共产党和社会党在内的所有民主力量的联合，进行努力。
    呼吁书最后要求全体党员竭尽全力，向人民群众进行宣传并且同群众一起讨论共产党的政策，以便使共产党和人民群众打成一片，参加竞选活动。呼吁书还要求党员努力奋斗，在选举斗争中经常站在人民的前列，努力加强人民的团结以及党和人民的联系，并且在这个斗争过程中扩大和加强党的队伍。
