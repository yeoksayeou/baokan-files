Accelerate Greening Speed and Improve Afforestation Quality

Now is the great season for planting trees and creating forests. All regions and all people's communes should, according to the principle of comprehensive planning for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and in accordance with local conditions, arrange the most suitable time to launch a large-scale spring afforestation campaign.

Last year, the cause of greening the motherland made a great leap forward. In one year, the country afforested 400 million mu, planted more than 30 billion trees around houses and villages, exceeding twice the total afforestation in the eight years after liberation; the quality of afforestation also improved. This year's plan is: the country must guarantee the completion of afforestation of 400 million mu, plant 40 billion trees around houses and villages, and cultivate 40 million mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests. The afforestation area last year was very large, so this year's task of tending young forests is even greater; this year's quality requirements for afforestation are higher than last year's. Completing this year's afforestation plan is a bigger and better leap forward on China's forestry front.

The "Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "We must carry out an all-round revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front." The great revolution on the entire agricultural front certainly includes the great revolution in forestry. This is not only because forestry is a part of the entire agricultural front, but also because forestry has a very close relationship with other industries. Developing forestry production can promote agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and is also inseparable from the development of industry and tool reform. Everyone knows that timber is a very important basic construction material and an important raw material for many means of production and means of livelihood. Afforestation is also an important measure to stabilize agricultural harvests and a long-term plan for increasing agricultural production. Forests can transform the climate and the ground, conserve water, soil, and fertilizer, and prevent drought, sand, and wind, and have a significant effect on eliminating floods, droughts, windstorms, and hailstorms. In many areas with barren land, agricultural output has increased significantly after afforestation. In many barren mountains and desert areas, the natural landscape has changed significantly after afforestation. Minqin County in Gansu Province, due to afforestation and sand control, has transformed the desert into fertile land after eight years of hard work, expanding the cultivated area by 420,000 mu, and the annual rainfall has also increased significantly compared to the past, which is one of the most prominent examples. Forests not only enable crops to grow healthily and safely, but also make pasture lush and fishery production abundant. With forests, in addition to forest trees, fruits, oil crops, and tea, a variety of birds, animals, medicinal materials, silk, and other mountain forest by-products can also grow, which can greatly develop the benefits of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, making the sideline production of people's communes more rich and colorful. In mountainous areas, the income from forestry and sideline occupations of the masses generally accounts for 30% to 40% of agricultural income; in mountainous areas with a large forest coverage rate, the income from forestry and sideline occupations is even greater. Many forestry and sideline products are necessary for the daily life of the broad masses of the people, and are also raw materials for industrial and handicraft production, and some are important export materials. People's communes, in order to implement the policy of giving equal importance to commodity production and self-sufficiency, cannot but pay attention to the development of forestry production.

The Party's Sixth Plenary Session's Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes put forward a great ideal: "Efforts should be made to gradually reduce the existing cultivated land area for growing crops to about one-third, depending on local conditions, within a few years, while the remaining part of the land should be rotated, planted with pasture and green manure, and another part of the land should be planted with trees, create forests, and dig lakes for water storage. Ornamental plants of various colors can be grown in large quantities on plains, mountains, and water surfaces to realize the gardenization of the land." This is the long-term goal of China's afforestation cause and the highest standard for greening the motherland. Reducing the cultivated land area can only be gradually realized under the condition of greatly increasing the unit area yield of crops. However, the afforestation work to realize this great ideal must not wait until a few years later to begin. All regions and all people's communes should now make afforestation work serve this great ideal. With the goal of gardenizing the land, the masses of commune members should be mobilized to discuss and formulate afforestation plans, so that every commune member understands the beautiful vision of building the motherland into a colorful garden, and that everyone puts in redoubled effort and enthusiasm into the current afforestation work.

In the afforestation plan, it is necessary to combine overall planning with adapting to local conditions. The so-called overall consideration is: we must take into account the needs of the local commune and the needs of national construction; we must take into account long-term interests and current interests; we must have sufficient forest bases and be conducive to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; we must be conducive to production and construction and to transforming nature and beautifying the land; we must consider timber forests and economic forests, and also protective forests, water source forests, and scenic forests; we must pay attention to greening and also to rapid and high yield. The so-called adapting to local conditions is to pay attention to determining the different priorities of different places according to the characteristics of each place: in large barren mountains, large deserts, and areas with severe soil erosion, the main task should be to accelerate the speed of greening. Whatever tree grows fast and grows well, plant that tree in order to quickly create a green shade and maintain water and soil. In particular, in desert and Gobi areas, we should accelerate the speed of greening, promote the combination of grass and trees, combine transformation and utilization, and transform the desert into a vast and rich new production base. In areas with better conditions, we should plan to establish supply bases for timber, fruits, and woody oil crops, and build various timber forests and economic forests on a large scale as soon as possible; at the same time, we should strengthen the management and operation of forests to promote the rapid growth and high yield of forests. Some units that need timber or other forest products and have afforestation conditions should strive to achieve self-sufficiency. For example, all mining enterprises should build enough mine pillar forests near the mining areas to meet the needs of mining, so as to obtain materials locally and supply them in a timely and sufficient manner; this can not only reduce costs, but also reduce long-distance transportation of timber, saving the country a lot of transportation capacity. In urban and rural residential areas, along roadsides and watersides, various fast-growing timber trees, fruit trees, mulberry trees, etc. should be planted, and some ornamental plants should be appropriately matched; we must green and beautify. In short, we must make good plans and implement them according to the principle of overall planning and adapting to local conditions.

When formulating plans, we must not only see the mutually promoting aspects of forestry and other industries, but also see the mutually conflicting aspects of forestry and other industries. Looking at the relationship between agriculture and forestry: gardenization of the land is a long-term goal; at present, we cannot reduce the planting area of crops too much at once, and the planting area of some crops will have to be expanded this year. However, trees grow relatively slowly, and if we wait until the yield of crops has greatly increased before starting to afforest the cultivated land, it will delay the time of gardenization. To solve this contradiction, under the conditions of making a land plan for gardenization, we can first select tree species that do not hinder crop production on some of the land that is intended to be abandoned in the future but is currently still planted with crops, and try agroforestry intercropping. Looking at the relationship between forestry and animal husbandry: not leaving appropriate pastures will cause difficulties for the development of animal husbandry; not restricting grazing locations will cause great damage to young forests. This contradiction must be resolved when formulating a comprehensive plan, and the location and area of forest land and pastures should be appropriately arranged. Looking at the relationship between forestry and sideline occupations: closing mountains for afforestation often conflicts with sideline occupations; this is essentially a contradiction between long-term interests and current interests. This contradiction can also be resolved through comprehensive planning.

Last year's great leap forward in afforestation work, like the great leap forward on various fronts, was the result of a mass movement. In order to make this year's afforestation work a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, we must better carry out the mass movement. In particular, we must seize the favorable season of spring and set off another climax of greening. Spring is the most suitable time for afforestation, and about 70% of this year's afforestation tasks must be completed in spring. Is it possible to carry out both spring farming preparation work centered on accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer, field management of summer harvest crops, and other work, and at the same time carry out the afforestation movement? Is there enough labor? This is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. This problem can be solved. The key is to strengthen centralized and unified leadership, give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, make proper arrangements for time and manpower, and at the same time actively improve labor organization and reform afforestation tools. All regions and all people's communes can make overall plans, draw a certain amount of time according to the entire situation of local agricultural activities, and concentrate their efforts to carry out afforestation. Effective methods such as holding on-site meetings and launching red flag competitions can be adopted to promote the mass movement of afforestation. At the same time, all people's communes should establish institutions for managing forestry and forestry production units, such as commune forest farms or forestry professional teams. Forestry work should be included in the commune's production plan. Regular professional work should be combined with seasonal shock work. Before the arrival of the season for shock afforestation, forest farms or professional teams should prepare seedlings and seeds, and make afforestation plans. Once the favorable time for afforestation arrives, the broad masses should be immediately mobilized to carry out shock afforestation. After afforestation, the regular tending and management work of the forest trees should be handed over to the commune forest farms or forestry professional teams. In the middle of shock afforestation, we must also divide into groups and assign areas, and establish a responsibility system; when afforestation comes to an end, it must be inspected and accepted by the forest farm personnel or professional team personnel responsible for managing each area. All teams and groups for shock afforestation must have professional personnel participating, and must be jointly responsible for the afforested trees to the end. In addition, we must also advocate commune members to plant trees next to their houses. This can not only increase the income of commune members, but also beautify the living environment. It should be announced that the achievements of commune members' scattered tree planting next to their houses and the ownership of the trees will always belong to the commune members, and the enthusiasm of the masses for planting and tending trees next to their houses should be promoted.

In order to achieve the goal of gardenizing the land as soon as possible, and in order to improve the quality of afforestation, we must carry out the movement for rapid growth and high yield of forest trees. The movement for rapid growth and high yield of forest trees is a new development in the greening movement in the great leap forward of 1958, and it was led by the Chinese fir, the main timber tree species in the south. It is generally believed that Chinese fir takes 30 years to become timber, but last year a large number of Chinese fir trees that became timber in 10 or 8 years were discovered in some places in Guizhou. This is the result of the local masses long-term cultivation of Chinese fir forests, mastering the growth law of Chinese fir, and processing and cultivating according to this law. This discovery has established confidence among the masses that people can change the character of trees and that forest trees can grow rapidly and produce high yields. In Jinping County of this province, the heroic slogan of "changing 18-year-old fir to 10-year-old fir" was first put forward, setting off a movement for rapid growth and high yield of forest trees. In other provinces, there have also been records of high yield of Chinese fir, oil tea, moso bamboo, and other forest trees, and a movement to create high-yield forests has been widely carried out. The area of creating fast-growing and high-yield forests is constantly expanding. Just as in agricultural production, high-yield fields drive ordinary fields to form a large-scale high-yield movement, in forestry production, fast-growing and high-yield forests must be the center to drive the national greening movement; in this way, not only can the speed of greening be accelerated, but also the quality of afforestation can be universally improved, and it is also an important way to quickly solve the problem of insufficient timber and oil crops. The main methods of rapid growth and high yield are to implement the six basic measures of forestry production: suitable trees for suitable land, meticulous land preparation, good seeds and strong seedlings, appropriate dense planting, tending and protection, and tool reform; in addition, in some places and at some times, under necessary and possible conditions, measures such as irrigation and fertilization should also be added. We must strive to plant trees as meticulously as we plant crops. In the afforestation movement, technical guidance should be strengthened so that these basic measures can be fully implemented in order to improve the survival rate of afforestation and make young forests grow fast and well. From the current situation, land preparation, young forest tending, and tool reform are the weakest, and these are the main links in afforestation work, so special attention must be paid to them. Young forest tending is especially important. Only planting trees without tending is equivalent to only giving birth to children without taking care of them, the consequences of which are unimaginable. We must take all organizational and technical measures to ensure that we tend one mu for every mu we afforest, plant one tree and manage one tree, ensure planting, ensure survival, ensure growth, and ensure timber.

"Ten points for indicators, twelve points for measures, and twenty-four points for hard work!" This slogan is equally applicable in forestry. We must give full play to our efforts. We must earnestly mobilize the broad masses and make them realize that the current planting of trees and forests is to start building a colorful garden on our vast and expansive land. After our hard work, in a few years, we will be able to completely change the natural landscape of our country. At that time, our country will be: good weather every year, bumper harvests of grain; green mountains and clear waters everywhere, birds singing and flowers fragrant; the landscape will be more beautiful, the climate will be better, the desert will become fertile land, and the land will be gardens; timber will be inexhaustible, mulberry and tea will be endless, fruits will be inexhaustible, and oil crops will be inexhaustible. In every place where we work and live, there will be: green shade in summer, red leaves in autumn, peach blossoms in spring, green pines in winter, fresh air, and pleasant scenery. As long as we put in enough effort, work hard, and work skillfully, this beautiful ideal can definitely be realized. Now, let us not fail to live up to the good spring time. Taking advantage of the best afforestation season of the year, with the goal of realizing the gardenization of the land, and with the movement for rapid growth and high yield of forest trees as the center, let us quickly set off a climax of spring afforestation!

### 加快绿化速度，提高造林质量

    加快绿化速度，提高造林质量
    现在，正是植树造林的大好时节。各个地区、各个人民公社，都应该根据农林牧副渔通盘规划的原则，按照当地的具体情况，安排最合适的时间，开展一个大规模的春季造林运动。
    去年，绿化祖国的事业有一个巨大的跃进。一年间，全国造林四亿亩，四旁植树三百多亿株，超过解放后八年造林总和的两倍；造林质量也有所提高。今年确定的计划是：全国要保证完成造林四亿亩，四旁植树四百亿株，培育速生丰产林四千万亩。去年造林的面积很大，今年抚育幼林的任务也就更大；今年造林的质量要求比去年更高。完成今年的造林计划，是我国林业战线上的更大更好的跃进。
    中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌”。整个农业战线的大革命，当然也包括林业的大革命。这不仅因为林业是整个农业战线的一部分，也因为林业同其它各业有极密切的相互关系。发展林业生产，可以促进农业、牧业、副业、渔业各项生产，同发展工业、工具改革也有不可分的关系。人人都知道，木材是十分重要的基本建设材料，又是许多生产资料和生活资料的重要原料。造林也是稳定农产丰收的重要措施，是农业增产的百年大计。森林能改造气候、改造地面，能保水、保土、保肥、防旱、防沙、防风，对消灭水灾、旱灾、风灾、雹灾有重大的作用。许多土地贫瘠的地区造林后，农业产量有显著提高。许多荒山、沙漠地区造林后，自然面貌有显著变化。甘肃省民勤县由于造林治沙，经过八年的奋战，把沙漠变成良田，使耕地面积扩大四十二万亩，每年降雨量也比过去提高了不少，就是最显著的例子之一。森林不但能使农作物健壮地安全地生长，也能使牧草肥美、渔产丰盈。有了森林，除林木和果品、油料、茶叶之外，还能生长多种鸟兽、药材、蚕丝和其它山林副产品，可以大兴山川草木之利，使人民公社的副业生产更加丰富多彩。各地山区群众林副业收入，一般占农业收入的30％到40％；森林复盖率较大的山区，林副业收入就更大。许多林副业产品是广大人民日常生活所必需的，也是工业、手工业生产的原料，有些是重要的出口物资。人民公社要贯彻执行商品性生产和自给性生产并举的方针，就不能不注意发展林业生产。
    党的六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中提出一个伟大的理想：“应当争取在若干年内，根据地方条件，把现有种农作物的耕地面积逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右，而以其余的一部分土地实行轮休，种牧草、肥田草，另一部分土地植树造林，挖湖蓄水，在平地、山上和水面都可以大种其万紫千红的观赏植物，实行大地园林化。”这是我国的造林事业的远大的目标，是绿化祖国的最高的标准。缩减耕地面积，这是要在大大提高农作物的单位面积产量的条件下才可能逐步实现的。可是，为实现这个伟大的理想而进行的造林工作却决不能等到若干年以后才动手。各个地区和各个人民公社现在就应该使造林工作服务于这个伟大的理想。应该以大地园林化为目标，发动社员群众讨论和制定造林规划，使每个社员都了解把祖国的大地建设成万紫千红的大花园的美丽的远景，使每个人都拿出加倍的干劲和热情投入目前的造林工作。
    在造林规划中，必须统筹全局和因地制宜相结合。所谓全局着眼，就是：既要顾及当地公社的需要，也要顾及国家建设的需要；既要顾及长远的利益，也要顾及当前的利益；既要有足够的森林基地，又要有利于农林牧副渔的综合发展；既要有利于生产建设，又要有利于改造自然、美化大地；既要考虑到用材林、经济林，也要考虑到防护林、水源林、风景林；既要注意到绿化，也要注意到快速丰产。所谓因地制宜，就是要注意按照各地的特点确定各地不同的重点：在大荒山、大沙漠和水土流失严重的地区，主要任务应是加快绿化速度。什么树生长的快、生长的好，就种植什么树，以求尽快地绿树成荫，保持住水土。特别是沙漠戈壁地带，更应该加快绿化速度，提倡草木并举，改造和利用相结合，变沙漠为广阔富饶的新生产基地。在条件较好的地区，就要有计划地建立木材、果品、木本油料的供应基地，尽快地大面积地营造各种用材林和经济林；同时也要加强林木的经营管理，促使林木速生丰产。有些需用木材或其他林产品而又有造林条件的单位，应力求做到自给。如各个采矿企业就应当在矿区附近营造足够采矿需用的矿柱林，以求就地取材，及时足量供应；这不但可以降低成本，还可以减少长途运材，为国家节省大量的运输力。在城乡居民区，在路旁、水旁，应该种植各种速生用材树、果树、桑树等等，并适当搭配一些观赏植物；既要绿化，又要美化。总之，要根据统筹全局、因地制宜的原则，做好规划，贯彻执行。
    在制定规划的时候，既要看到林业同其他各业相互促进的一面，也要看到林业同其他各业相互矛盾的一面。就农业和林业的关系来看：大地园林化是一个长远的奋斗目标；目前，还不能一下子把农作物的种植面积缩小过多，有些作物的种植面积今年还要扩大。可是林木又生长得比较慢，等农作物产量大大提高以后才开始在退耕的地上造林，就要拖迟园林化的时间。为解决这个矛盾，可以在作好园林化的土地规划的条件下，先以一部分打算将来弃耕而目前仍在种植农作物的土地，选择不妨碍农作物生产的树种，试行农林混作。就林业和牧业的关系来看：不留出适当的牧场，对牧业的发展会造成困难；不对放牧地点加以限制，会使幼林受到很大损失。这个矛盾，要在制定全面规划时注意解决，要把林地和牧场的位置、面积加以适当的安排。就林业和副业的关系来看：封山育林同副业时常发生矛盾；这实质上是长远利益和目前利益的矛盾。这个矛盾，通过全面规划也是可以解决的。
    去年造林工作的大跃进，同各个战线上的大跃进一样，是大搞群众运动的结果。为了使今年造林工作更大、更好、更全面地跃进，必须更好地开展群众运动。特别是要抓住春天这个有利季节，再掀起一个绿化高潮。春季最适宜造林，今年的造林任务要有70％左右在春季完成。既要做好以积肥造肥为中心的春耕准备工作和夏收作物的田间管理工作和其他工作，又要同时开展造林运动，是不是可能呢？劳动力是不是够用呢？这是一个迫切需要解决的问题。这个问题是可以解决的。关键在于加强集中统一的领导，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，把时间和人力作妥善的安排，同时积极改进劳动组织、改革造林工具。各地各个人民公社可以统筹规划一下，按照当地农事活动的整个情况，抽出一定时间，集中力量突击造林。可以采取召开现场会议、开展红旗竞赛等有效办法，推动造林的群众运动。同时，各个人民公社要建立管理林业的机构和林业生产单位，如公社林场或林业专业队。要把林业工作纳入公社的生产计划之内。要把经常的专业工作和季节性突击工作结合起来，在突击造林的季节到来之前，林场或专业队要准备好树苗、树籽，做好造林规划。造林的有利时机一到，立即发动广大群众突击造林。造林之后，就把经常性的林木抚育和经营管理工作交给公社林场或林业专业队负责。在突击造林中间，也要分组划片，建立责任制度；造林告一段落的时候，要由负责管理各个地段的林场人员或专业队人员验收。突击造林的各个队组，都要有专业人员参加，对所造林木要共同负责到底。此外，还要提倡社员在宅旁植树。这既可以增加社员收入，又可以美化生活环境。要宣布社员的宅旁零星植树的成果和树木所有权永远归社员所有，发扬群众种植和抚育宅旁树木的积极性。
    为了早日达到大地园林化的目的，为了提高造林质量，必须开展林木速生丰产运动。林木速生丰产运动是绿化运动在1958年大跃进中的新发展，是以南方主要用材树种杉木为先锋带动起来的。一般认为杉木要三十年才能成材，但去年在贵州一些地方却发现了大量的十年、八年成材的杉木。这是当地群众长期培养杉木林，掌握了杉木的生长规律，根据这规律加工培育的结果。这个发现，在群众中树立了人可以改变树的性格、林木可以速生丰产的信心。在这个省的锦屏县，首先提出了“改十八年杉为十年杉”的豪迈口号，掀起了林木速生丰产运动。在其他各省，也出现了杉木、油茶、毛竹及其他林木的高额丰产纪录，普遍开展了营造丰产林运动。营造速生丰产林的面积，正在不断扩大。正像在农业生产方面由高额丰产田带动一般田形成大规模的丰产运动一样，在林业生产方面，也要以速生丰产林为中心，带动全民绿化运动；这样，不但可以加快绿化速度，并且可以使造林质量普遍提高，也是迅速解决木材、油料不足问题的重要途径。速生丰产的主要方法，就是贯彻执行林业生产的六项基本措施：适地适树，细致整地，良种壮苗，适当密植，抚育保护，改革工具；此外，在有些地方、有些时候，在必要和可能的条件下，还要加上灌水和施肥等措施。要力求做到种树像种庄稼一样细致。在造林运动中要加强技术指导，使这些基本措施得以全面贯彻执行，以求提高造林成活率，使幼林长得又快又好。就当前情况来看，整地、幼林抚育和改革工具三方面最为薄弱，而这些又是造林工作的主要环节，必须特别重视。幼林抚育工作尤为重要。只栽树不抚育，等于只生孩子不管养活，其后果是不堪设想的。一定要采取一切组织措施和技术措施，切实做到造一亩抚育一亩，栽一株管理一株，保栽保活，保长大保成材。
      “十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲！”这口号在林业方面同样适用。一定要把干劲鼓得足足的。要认真地发动广大群众，使群众认识到：现在的植树造林，就是着手在我们的辽阔广大的国土上建造一个丰富多彩的大花园。经过我们的辛勤劳动，在若干年后，就可以彻底改变我国的自然面貌。那时候，我国将是：年年风调雨顺，五谷丰登；处处山绿水清，鸟语花香；江山更加多娇，气候更加美好，沙漠变成沃土，大地皆是园林；木材取不竭，桑茶采不尽，水果吃不完，油料用不了。在我们工作和生活的每一个地方，都是：绿荫护夏，红叶迎秋，春风桃李，冬雪苍松，空气清新，风景宜人。只要鼓足干劲苦干巧干，这个美好的理想是一定可以实现的。现在，我们切莫辜负大好春光，趁这一年之中最好的造林季节，以实现大地园林化为目标，以林木速生丰产运动为中心，迅速地掀起一个春季造林的高潮！
