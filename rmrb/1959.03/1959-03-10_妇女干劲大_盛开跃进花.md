A Good Husband and Wife on the Ranch

In the Gong-Mu-Xue (Worker-Herder-Student) Experimental Farm in Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, there is a very harmonious and loving couple. The man is named Liang Shucheng, and the woman is named Liu Guangxiu. Because of their consistently conscientious and responsible work, they have been rated as models in the farm twice.

It is remembered that in June of last year, when they were first transferred from the countryside to the farm, the leadership assigned Liang Shucheng to learn carpentry and Liu Guangxiu to learn pig raising. They did not hesitate and started working as soon as they received their assignments. The couple was always so diligent and eager to learn. Often, even after two o'clock in the morning, you could still see Liang Shucheng studying planing and cutting round wood under the dim kerosene lamp. Some time ago, under Liang Shucheng's suggestion and leadership, seven carpenters used old waste materials and completed tasks such as ten-ridge roof frames in fifteen days, saving one hundred and twenty logs of raw wood.

When people were celebrating his achievements, his wife, Liu Guangxiu, also congratulated him, but secretly resolved: "If the husband becomes a hero, the wife must also become a model." From then on, Liu Guangxiu's work became even more outstanding. One day, a sow gave birth to seven piglets. At that time, the weather was freezing, and the sow's milk was insufficient. Liu Guangxiu tried every means to personally light a fire to keep the piglets warm and squeezed milk to feed them every day. The seven newborn piglets grew bigger day by day under her care. When they hung big red flowers on their chests, people praised them and composed a folk song for the couple:

　　There is a good husband and wife on the ranch,
　　The two help each other and are affectionate.
　　Like a pair of phoenixes in harmony, their enthusiasm is great,
　　Neither one is worse than the other.

Constantly Thinking of Production Bai Shuyun came out of the venue of the Fourth Beijing Municipal Women's Congress, it was already past six o'clock in the afternoon. Her home was nearby, and since there was a meeting to attend the next day, she could have gone home to rest.

"No!" Bai Shuyun thought as she walked, there were only a few days left in the month, and the factory's production tasks were very tight. She was away at the meeting, and the newcomer who replaced her was not very skilled. If she didn't go back to catch up, the plan might not be completed. Thinking of this, she quickly took a bus to the southern suburbs and returned to the Metal Craft Factory. It was already past eight o'clock. She didn't even bother to sit down for dinner and went straight into the carbon rod workshop, chewing on a bun. The newcomer who replaced her was nervously printing trademarks on the carbon rods. Thousands of carbon rods were piled up on the workbench, and it seemed that the printing work couldn't keep up, and the packaging workers were likely to be idled. After inspecting the machine, Bai Shuyun started operating it herself, working until two o'clock in the morning, printing more than six thousand carbon rods. During the week of meetings, she spent four days attending meetings during the day and rushing back to the factory twenty miles away to produce at night. Bai Shuyun is a female worker who loves the factory more than her home and has a strong sense of responsibility. In order to improve printing efficiency, she painstakingly studied in her spare time and converted the hand-pushed printer into a foot-pedaled one, increasing labor efficiency by more than 20%.

Bai Shuyun's conscientious and responsible work spirit is loved and respected by people. She was recently named an advanced producer of the whole factory in 1958 and was recently selected as a representative to attend the Dongcheng District 1958 Advanced Producers Representative Meeting.

A Crayon

In the office of the Chayuan Hutong Kindergarten in Beijing, a child's parent was talking to the principal, Wang Xiuzhen, about his child's situation. He said: "Kindergarten education cares for children even more than we do. The education work is done very carefully. At home, we only know how to take care of his food and clothing, and we never care about or know how to educate him. We let him play in the yard all day long."

Once, two children in the senior class were crying and shouting over a crayon, "This is mine!" Luo Diyuan held the crayon tightly and refused to let go. "It's mine!" Li Lixing cried very hard.

Whose crayon was it after all? Seeing Li Lixing crying so hard, it was estimated that the crayon might be his, and some teachers advocated giving the crayon to him. However, Wang Xiuzhen did not deal with it lightly. She thought: a crayon is only worth one fen, which is a small matter, but if it is handled incorrectly, it will bring great harm to the child. If a child who should not get the crayon gets it, it will develop the habit of lying and being greedy for small advantages. If the child who lost the crayon feels that the teacher is unfair and does not trust the teacher, then the teacher will not be able to educate him in the future. She called Luo Diyuan aside and asked him who bought the crayon? How much did it cost? When did you buy it? Luo Diyuan answered very clearly. Then he called Li Lixing out and asked him the same questions, but Li Lixing hesitated and couldn't answer clearly. Then she took the crayon and asked the other children in the class, "Do you recognize whose crayon this is?" "Yes, it's Luo Diyuan's."

The problem was very clear. Wang Xiuzhen was not in a hurry to deal with it. She pulled Li Lixing aside and told him a story about the disadvantages of telling lies in a kind and gentle manner, and said, "If you like crayons, the teacher will buy you one, but don't lie." The child was educated and admitted that the crayon was indeed not his.

In order to make the matter handled accurately, Wang Xiuzhen specially visited the parents of the two children the next day, proving that the crayon was indeed bought for her grandson by Luo Diyuan's grandmother for one fen. Only then did she give the crayon to Luo Diyuan, and the child was so happy that he jumped up, and from then on he was more affectionate with Teacher Wang.

Because Wang Xiuzhen cultivated children so carefully, Li Lixing's parents specially came to the kindergarten to express their gratitude.

    妇女干劲大　盛开跃进花
    牧场一对好夫妻
    贵州黔西县工牧学试验场，有一对非常和睦、互敬互爱的夫妻。男的叫梁树成，女的叫刘光秀。由于他俩工作一贯认真负责，曾两次被评为场里的模范。
    记得，去年6月，当他俩刚从农村调到场里，领导上分配梁树成学木工、刘光秀学养猪时，他们毫不犹豫，接到活路就干。夫妻俩，总是那样地刻苦好学。在午夜两点多钟的时候，你还能经常看见梁树成在半明半暗的煤油灯下，学推刨、解元木……。前些时候，在梁树成的建议和带动下，七个木工利用旧废料，十五天功夫，完成了十櫺屋架等任务，并节约了元木一百二十根。
    当人们都为他的成绩庆贺时，他的妻子刘光秀，也向他祝贺，可是她却暗地里下了决心：“夫做英雄，妻也要当模范。”从此，刘光秀的工作就更见起色。有一天，一头母猪生了七个崽，当时天寒地冻，母猪的乳又缺乏，刘光秀想尽办法，亲自烧火给小猪烤，每天挤牛奶喂小猪。七头初生的小猪，在她的照管下，一天天的长大了。当他俩胸前悬挂着大红花的时候，人们赞扬地为他夫妇俩编唱起一首山歌：
    牧场有对好夫妻，
    两人互助又相亲。
    鸾凤和鸣干劲大，
    一个不比一个差。时刻不忘生产白淑云从北京市第四届妇女代表大会会场出来，已经下午六点多了，家就在附近，明天还要开会，本来可以回家休息了。
    “不！”白淑云边走边想，离月底只有几天了，工厂的生产任务很紧，她出来开会，代替她的新手技术不大熟练，如果不回去赶一赶，计划就有完不成的危险，想到这里，她迅速地搭上去南郊的公共汽车，回到金属工艺厂。这时，已经八点多了，她顾不上坐下来吃饭，嚼着馒头就走进炭精车间。代替她的新手正紧张地在炭精棒上打印商标，工作台上堆了几千支炭精棒，看来打印工作接不上去，包装工人很可能窝工。白淑云检查机器后就动手操作起来，一直干到深夜两点，打印了六千多支炭精棒。在开会的一星期中，有四天她都是白天开会，晚上赶回二十里外的工厂生产。白淑云是个爱厂胜过爱家，责任心很强的女工。她为了提高打印效率，在业余时间苦心钻研，把手推式的打印机改成脚踏式，使劳动效率提高20％以上。
    白淑云这种认真负责的工作精神，受到人们的爱戴与尊敬，不久前被评为1958年全厂的先进生产者，最近还被选为出席东城区1958年先进生产者代表会议的代表。一支石笔
    在北京市察院胡同幼儿园的办公室里，一位孩子的家长正和园长王秀珍谈着他孩子的情况，他说：“幼儿园教育，关心孩子真胜过我们，教育工作做得真细致，在家里我们只知管他吃、穿，从来顾不上、也不懂得怎么教育他，整天让他自己在院里玩。”
    有一次，大班的两个孩子为了争一支石笔又哭又嚷，“这是我的！”罗弟元拿着石笔不撒手，“是我的！”李立兴呜呜地哭得很厉害。
    石笔到底是谁的呢？看李立兴哭得那么厉害的样子，估计石笔可能是他的，也有的老师主张把石笔给他。可是王秀珍却不轻易处理，她想：一支石笔只值一分钱是件小事，可是要是处理错了，就会给孩子带来很大损害，不该得到石笔的孩子得了会养成撒谎、贪小便宜的习惯，失去了石笔的孩子会感到老师不公平，不信任老师，那样以后老师就无法对他进行教育。他把罗弟元叫到一边问他石笔是谁买的？多少钱？什么时候买的？罗弟元回答得很清楚。之后他又叫出李立兴问他同样的问题，李立兴却支支吾吾说不清楚。接着她又拿着石笔问班上其他小孩子，“你们认得这支石笔是谁的？”“认得，是罗弟元的。”
    问题已很清楚了，王秀珍还不急于处理，她把李立兴拉到一边，和颜悦色地对他讲了一个说假话有什么坏处的故事，又说，你要喜欢石笔，老师给你买一支，但千万别说谎。孩子受到了教育，承认石笔确实不是他的。
    为了使这件事处理得千准万确，第二天王秀珍又特地去访问了这两个孩子的家长，证明石笔确是罗弟元姥姥花一分钱给外孙买的。这样她才把石笔给了罗弟元，孩子因此乐得跳起来，从此对王老师也更亲热了。
    由于王秀珍培养孩子这样认真，李立兴的家长特地跑到幼儿园来表示感谢。（附图片）
