    For the Health of the Working People
    We Must Go to Factories More Often
    Yang Guan, an ophthalmologist at Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital, felt sympathy and annoyance when facing a lathe operator who was constantly shedding tears because iron filings kept flying into his eyes. He complained to the worker: "Why don't you wear protective glasses?"

    Later, Yang Guan went to the First Machine Tool Factory for labor training. As soon as he got to the lathe, he saw iron filings spraying from the cutting edge. The worker was leaning sideways, squinting, trying to avoid the splashing debris from flying into his eyes. Yang Guan earnestly advised his fellow workers to wear protective glasses. The workers told him: it is inconvenient to wear glasses; the heat fogs up the lenses, and they often have to stop working to wipe the lenses, which delays production. Yang Guan was myopic and wore glasses himself. He leaned close to the lathe, and soon enough, his lenses fogged up. While wiping his lenses, he thought with shame: "I was too arbitrary in the past. I didn't get in touch with the reality of production, and I just fantasized in the hospital, thinking I was something great." Yang Guan remembered that the head of the ophthalmology department had made a chip guard for a planer. Could a chip guard be made for a lathe as well? Yang Guan and the factory's labor protection committee worked together and made a double-layered glass chip guard four inches wide and three inches long.

    The chip guard was inserted into the screws in front of the tool holder. When the machine rotated, the iron filings were blocked and fell to the ground. The operator could look directly at the tool holder without having to lean sideways to avoid the debris. The workers were very happy, and Yang Guan was also very happy. His first thought was: I must go to the factory more often in the future.
    "You are so good!"
    Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine teachers and students went to the countryside to help eliminate pests and diseases. One day, a female student, Chen Yiping, found a female patient lying in a remote hut, pale, emaciated, silent, and motionless. This was Lu Yuemei, a member of the Qinfeng People's Commune. She suffered terribly in the old society's "baby homes" in her childhood. Although she had a happy life after liberation, she was too weak. After giving birth to a child last July, she suffered from severe nutritional deficiency, and some doctors had already considered it "impossible to revive" her. Her mother-in-law and husband had also lost hope. Upon discovering such a serious patient, Chen Yiping immediately told the Party branch. The Party branch immediately sent people to conduct a detailed examination and diagnosed Lu Yuemei's illness as: severe multiple vitamin deficiency, pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by pleurisy, bronchopneumonia, rheumatic knee and hip arthritis, and tuberculous knee and hip arthritis. In the words of traditional Chinese medicine, she had reached the point of "extreme deficiency of both qi and yin." Facing such a critical situation, the Party branch decided: we must do our best to cure this patient. Party members, Youth League members, and all doctors made solemn guarantees: we must promote a high degree of communist spirit and snatch Lu Yuemei back from the hands of death.

    The battle to rescue Lu Yuemei immediately began. Senior and junior doctors cooperated, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The rescue team ran to Minhang, ten miles away, to buy cardiotonics. The nursing team guarded the bedside day and night, handling excrement and urine without minding the filth. Chen Deming gave his new quilt to the patient, replacing her soiled quilt due to incontinence. They decocted medicine, administered medicine, and gave injections on time. After several sleepless nights, the tenacious medical workers defeated death. Lu Yuemei gradually improved, escaped the danger period, could eat and drink on her own, and had already begun to chat and smile. She said: "Doctors, you are so good!"

    The peasants spread the word: Chairman Mao has sent "immortals" to save Yuemei.
    Rescuing a Critically Ill Child
    As it got dark, the rain grew heavier. Dr. Ren Jiawei, who lived in Beilu, Shanghai County, helping the Qinfeng People's Commune prevent and treat measles, was preparing to rest when Xu Guohua's grandfather, carrying a small lantern, walked in and said anxiously: "Doctor, the child is seriously ill..." Before he finished speaking, Ren Jiawei picked up his medicine bag, put on his raincoat, and left.

    Three-year-old Guohua was lying in bed, his eyes tightly closed, hypoxic, breathing rapidly with phlegm, his nostrils flaring, his face cyanotic, and his fever over forty degrees. Based on such a serious condition, he should generally be transferred to the hospital for oxygen and fluid infusion. However, the transfer would require walking more than ten miles, which would be very detrimental to the sick child in such heavy rain. Ren Jiawei thought: I am a doctor, and I should do everything possible to save the patient. At this time, the child's parents were also hesitant. Ren Jiawei decisively said to them:

    "It's raining so hard, we can't send him to the hospital. I'll treat him at home."

    Ren Jiawei injected the child with penicillin and streptomycin while giving him Maxing Ganshi Decoction based on the principle of traditional Chinese medicine for resolving phlegm. The child was dehydrated, so Ren Jiawei tried to give him fluids. Ren Jiawei kept giving the child decoction of cogongrass rhizome, according to a proven prescription. For one day and two days, Ren Jiawei never left the child's bedside. On the third day, the child's breathing was stable and he could eat. Only then did Ren Jiawei leave with peace of mind.

    为了劳动人民的健康
    一定要多下工厂
    上海市立第六人民医院眼科医生杨冠，面对着因为铁屑飞进眼睛不断流着眼泪的车工，既同情又烦躁。他埋怨工人：“为什么不戴防护眼镜？”
    后来杨冠到第一机床厂劳动锻炼。他一到车床旁，看到铁屑从刀口处喷射出来，工人斜着身子眯缝着眼睛，竭力避着飞溅的屑渣，不让它飞进眼睛。他还竭力劝工人同志戴上防护眼镜。工人告诉他：戴着眼镜不方便，热气雾花了眼镜片，常常要停下工作来擦镜片，这样会耽误生产。杨冠是个近视眼，本来就戴着眼镜，他俯身凑近车床，不久果然镜片雾花了。他一边擦镜片，一边惭愧地想：“我过去实在太武断，不接触生产实际，在医院空想一套，还以为自己了不起呢。”杨冠想起眼科主任曾经为刨床做过防屑罩，车床是不是也可以做呢。杨冠和厂里的劳保委员一起研究，做了一个四寸宽三寸长的双层玻璃防屑板。
    防屑板插在刀台前面的螺丝钉上，机器转动的时候铁屑被挡得纷纷落地，操作的工人可以正对着刀台看，不用偏着身子躲避了。工人很高兴，杨冠也很高兴，他第一个念头就是：以后一定要多下厂。
    “你们太好了”
    上海中医学院师生下乡帮助除害灭病，有一天，女学生陈以萍在一间偏僻的小屋里，发现床上躺着一个女病人，脸色惨白，身体枯瘦，不说话也不动弹。这是勤丰人民公社社员陆悦梅，幼年时在旧社会的“育婴堂”受尽摧残，虽然解放后有了幸福的生活，但因身体太弱，去年7月间生了一个孩子后，患了高度营养缺乏症，奄奄一息，一些医生都已认为“回春无术”，婆婆和丈夫也已失望。发现这样严重的病人，陈以萍马上告诉了党支部。党支部立即派人去详细检查，诊断出陆悦梅的病是：高度多种维生素缺乏，肺结核并发胸膜炎、支气管肺炎、风湿性膝髋关节炎还有结核性膝髋关节炎。用中医的话来说，是到了“气阴极度亏竭”的地步。面临着这样危急的情况，党支部决定：一定要尽力治好这个病人。党员、团员以及所有大夫都纷纷提出了庄严的保证：要发扬高度的共产主义风格，把陆悦梅从死神手边夺回来。
    抢救陆悦梅的战斗马上展开了。老年医师和青年医师携手合作，中西医疗法结合，抢救组为买强心剂，医生们跑到十里外的闵行去买，护理组日夜守护在病床前，端屎倒尿，不嫌脏臭，陈德铭把自己的新被给病人盖，换下她因大小便失禁而弄脏的被子，他们按时煎药、喂药、打针，经过几个不眠之夜，顽强的医务工作者击败了死神，陆悦梅逐渐好转，脱离了危险期，能自己吃饭、喝水，并且已开始和人微笑着说长道短，她说：“医生呵，你们太好了！”。
    农民们奔走相告：毛主席派来了“仙人”把悦梅救过来了。
    抢救垂危的病孩
    天黑的时候，雨越来越大，住在上海县北陆帮助勤丰人民公社防治麻疹的任家维医生，正准备休息，肺炎病孩徐国华的祖父，提着个小方灯走进来，着急地说：“大夫，孩子病重了……。”任家维没等说完，背上药包披起雨衣就走。
    三岁的小国华躺在床上，眼睛紧闭，缺氧，呼吸急促而有痰声，鼻翼不停地搧动着，脸色青紫，烧到四十度以上。根据这样严重的状况，一般都应该转送医院，输氧、输水。但是转院需要步行十多里，那么大的雨，对病孩很不利。任家维想：自己是个医生，应该尽一切力量挽救病人。这时，孩子的家长们也在犹豫，任家维果断地对他们说：
  “雨那么大，不能送医院，就在家里由我来治疗。
    任家维一面给小孩注射青霉素，链霉素一面根据中医化痰的原理，给他吃麻杏甘石汤，小孩缺水，设法输水，任家维就按验方给孩子不断喝清热的茅根汤。一天两天，任家维一直没有离开过孩子的床边，第三天，孩子呼吸平稳能吃东西了，任家维才放心地走了。
