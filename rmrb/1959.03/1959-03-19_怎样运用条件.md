How to Utilize Conditions

In doing any work, one must proceed from reality, that is, from the specific conditions of the time and place. However, people's understanding of specific conditions is not always the same. Some people only see objective conditions and fixate on them; this is the view of "condition-ism." Others see both objective and subjective conditions and can correctly analyze the relationship between them, giving full play to the active role of subjective conditions. This is a dialectical and comprehensive view.

Yingjisha County, located in the western frontier of our country, does not have very favorable natural conditions, and the original plan was to produce 400 jin of wheat per mu. Later, because they gave full play to the active role of people, comprehensively checked and analyzed the growth of winter wheat, and found many favorable conditions and specific measures to strive for a bumper harvest, they improved the confidence of cadres and the masses. They immediately raised the target from 400 jin to 1,000 jin. This is an example of being good at recognizing and utilizing specific conditions.

    怎样运用条件
    做工作一定要从实际出发，也就是要从当时当地的具体条件出发。但人们对具体条件的认识，却不尽相同。有的人只看见客观条件，并且把它固定化，这是“唯条件论”者的看法。有的人既看到客观条件，也看到主观条件，并且能正确地分析主客观条件之间的关系，充分发挥主观条件的积极作用，这就是辩证的、全面的看法。
    地处我国西部边疆的英吉沙县，自然条件不够好，原计划小麦亩产四百斤；后来由于他们充分发挥了人的能动作用，全面地检查和分析了冬小麦生长情况，找到了许多争取大丰收的有利条件和具体措施，从而提高了干部和群众的信心，他们马上把指标从四百斤提高到一千斤。这就是善于认识和运用具体条件的一个例子。
