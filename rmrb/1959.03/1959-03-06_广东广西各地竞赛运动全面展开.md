This newspaper reports from Nanning on the 5th. A spring plowing production competition, aiming to strive for the top and seize the leading banner, is unfolding in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The main contents of this competition include: competing for total grain output and overall leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries; competing for increased total income of people's communes and net income of members; competing for the completion of various national tasks; competing for democratic management of communes, diligent and thrifty management of communes, planned grain consumption, and collective welfare undertakings; and competing for political and ideological work and the mass line.

The great competition was proposed by the Yulin Special District. This special district achieved five major harvests last year in ideology, grain, steel, sideline occupations, and cash crops, and 90% of its members increased their income. This year, the competition targets of the Yulin Special District are: a yield of 3,000 jin per mu for rice, 30,000 jin per mu for sugarcane, and 500 jin per mu for peanuts. The production of coarse grains and other crops should be doubled compared to last year. At the same time, the special district should vigorously develop industry and sideline occupations. After the competition was proposed, the Wuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin Special Districts immediately responded, and the Baise and Liuzhou Special Districts also successively joined the competition upsurge. In order to realize the competition plan, each special district has put forward specific measures.

At present, the great competition in various special districts has stimulated greater revolutionary drive among the masses. On the basis of completing deep plowing, the Yulin Special District is carrying out a movement to accumulate 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu. The counties and communes of the Wanglin and Wuzhou Special Districts are mutually selecting targets to launch competitions. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the entire autonomous region has increased more than twofold compared to the same period last year, and significant achievements have also been made in early rice planting, afforestation, and water conservancy projects.

    广东广西各地竞赛运动全面展开
    本报南宁5日电　一场争上游，夺帅旗的春耕生产大竞赛，正在广西僮族自治区展开。
    这场竞赛的主要内容有：比粮食总产量和农林牧副渔的全面跃进；比人民公社总收入和社员纯收入的增加；比完成国家各项任务；比民主办社、勤俭办社、计划用粮和集体福利事业；比政治思想工作和群众路线。
    大竞赛是玉林专区提出的，这个专区去年获得了思想、粮食、钢铁、副业和经济作物的五大丰收，90％的社员增加了收入。今年，玉林专区的竞赛指标是：水稻亩产三千斤，甘蔗亩产三万斤，花生亩产五百斤，杂粮和其他作物比去年翻一番，同时还要大办工业和副业。竞赛提出后，梧州、南宁、桂林三个专区立即应战，百色、柳州二个专区也相继投入了竞赛热潮。为了实现竞赛计划，各专区都提出了具体措施。
    目前，各专区的大竞赛，已经激起了群众更大的革命干劲。玉林专区在完成深耕的基础上，正开展每亩积肥千担运动；王林、梧州二专区各县、各公社，互选对象展开竞赛。全自治区积得的肥料比去年同期增加二倍以上，早稻播种、造林、水利等工作，也获得了显著的成绩。
