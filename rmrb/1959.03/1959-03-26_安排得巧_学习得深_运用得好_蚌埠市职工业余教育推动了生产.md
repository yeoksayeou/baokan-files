    Well-Arranged, Deep Learning, Good Application:
    Bengbu City's Workers' Spare-Time Education Promotes Production
    (Reported by our newspaper) Bengbu City's various factory workers' spare-time schools, in the teaching process, implement the policy of teaching serving production, closely integrating with current production while systematically learning cultural knowledge and basic theory. After workers learned cultural knowledge, it promoted the development of the technological revolution, powerfully promoting production.
    In the Great Leap Forward in production, Bengbu City's workers' spare-time education has greatly developed. According to recent incomplete statistics, thirty-two factories, including the Machinery Factory, Glass Factory, and Dyeing and Weaving Factory, have established eighty-two various workers' spare-time schools, with an enrollment of more than 30,000 people. The source of teachers in these schools, based on the principle of "those who are capable are teachers," has been basically resolved by combining technicians, veteran workers, and full-time teachers. In the arrangement of production and teaching time, the principle of "learn more when less busy, learn less when very busy" is adopted, and methods such as unified class arrangement, shift classes, and contract teaching are used to solve the problem. In case of major political movements, flexible arrangements are made to conduct on-site teaching. For example, the spare-time engineering school, during the mass campaign to produce steel, in order to meet the needs of rushing to build furnaces, moved the school to the construction site, adopting a "seize every opportunity" method during labor, having classes by the furnace and insisting on on-site teaching. Therefore, even under the most intense production conditions, the school can persist in teaching, and the student attendance rate reaches over 90%. The teaching content takes production as the center, implementing a combination of politics, technology, and culture; each school teaches technical courses according to the characteristics of the factory, workshop, and type of work, and the current needs of production. For example, in the air compressor workshop of the Machinery Factory, the technical courses cover lathes, drafting, and the structure of compressors; factory office cadres teach factory management business; cooks teach hygiene knowledge, nutrition, cooking, etc.
  During the teaching process, each school, on the one hand, revises the original teaching materials, and on the other hand, compiles new teaching materials. Now, general schools have compiled a set of technical textbooks for various different majors and factory mathematics, physics, and chemistry textbooks suitable for the factory's production needs. Bengbu Machinery Factory has compiled more than 30 kinds of teaching materials. For example, the compound number part of mathematics has increased the commonly used metric and imperial unit conversions in production, and cut out excessive example operations in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers and decimals; the fraction application problem part has added the conical angle calculation commonly used by machine workers when processing conical products; the polygon part of geometry has increased the simple calculation methods of opposite sides and opposite angles of pentagons and hexagons commonly used by workers; the projection part is incorporated into the mechanical drawing course (because machine workers are more familiar with it and easier to understand). Political and language courses are also compiled and selected based on the current political struggle and real life. This ensures that teaching serves production and enables workers to learn systematic cultural knowledge and basic theory.
    Because teaching is closely integrated with production, the role of factory-run schools in production is significant. The spare-time school established by the Dyeing and Weaving Factory has persisted in teaching for six years. Over the past six years, it has not only improved the workers' cultural level and cultivated a large number of technical talents, self-reliantly solving the difficulty of insufficient technical talents in production development, but also transferred technical forces to support new factories. Veteran worker Wang Guodong, who studied in the spare-time school of the Machinery Factory, improved the lathe tool after studying tool science, increasing work efficiency by sixteen times.
    Now, the workers' spare-time schools of various factories, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, are focusing on consolidating and improving work. In order to make teaching work better serve production, they are organizing technicians and teachers and students to compile and select new teaching materials, and sending full-time teachers to workshops to follow production, understand the production process, better combine the characteristics of production to compile teaching materials and carry out teaching work, so that workers can not only learn and apply what they have learned, but also learn systematic cultural knowledge.

    安排得巧　学习得深　运用得好
    蚌埠市职工业余教育推动了生产
    本报讯　蚌埠市各工厂的职工业余学校，在教学过程中，贯彻教学为生产服务的方针，既与当前生产紧密结合，又系统学习文化知识和基础理论。职工们学到文化知识后，促进了技术革命的开展，有力地推动了生产。
    在生产大跃进中，蚌埠市职工业余教育有很大的发展。据最近不完全统计，机械厂、玻璃厂、染织厂等三十二个工厂，已办起各种职工业余学校八十二所，入学人数达三万多人。这些学校的师资来源，本着能者为师的原则，以技术员、老工人和专职教师结合的办法，基本上得到解决。在生产与教学时间安排上，是以“小忙多学，大忙少学”的原则，采取了统一编班，轮班上课，包教包学等办法解决，遇有重大的政治运动，灵活安排，进行现场教学。如业余工程学校，在全民大办钢铁运动中，为了适应突击建炉需要，把学校搬上工地，在劳动中采用见缝插针的办法，炉边上课，坚持现场教学。因此，在生产最紧张的情况下，学校也能坚持教学，学生出席率达到90％以上。教学内容，以生产为中心，实行政治、技术、文化三结合的办法；各校根据工厂、车间、工种的特点与当前生产的需要，讲授技术课。如机械厂空气压缩机车间，技术课讲车床、制图和压缩机的构造等；工厂科室干部讲工厂管理业务；炊事员讲卫生常识、营养学、烹调学等。
  在教学过程中，各校一方面修改原有教材，一方面编写新的教材，现在，一般的学校都编出了一套各个不同专业的技术课本和适合本厂生产需要的工厂数学、理化课本。蚌埠机械厂已编出三十多种教材，如数学中的复名数部分增加了生产上常用的公英制换算，砍去了整数和小数加、减、乘、除中过多的例题运算；分数应用题部分，补上机械工人加工锥形产品常用的锥形角度计算；几何课多角形部分增加工人惯用的五角六角对边对角的简易计算方法；投影部分并入到机械制图课（因为机械工人比较熟悉，容易理解）。政治、语文课也根据当前政治斗争和现实生活进行编选。这样就保证了教学既为生产服务，又使工人学习到系统的文化知识和基础理论。
    由于教学和生产紧密结合起来，工厂办学对生产起的作用很大。染织厂创办的业余学校，教学坚持了六年。六年来，不但提高了工人的文化水平，培养了大批的技术人才，自力更生地解决了生产发展中技术人才不足的困难，而且抽调技术力量支援新建厂。在机械厂业余学校学习的老工人王国栋，学习了工具学以后，改进了车刀工具，提高工作效率十六倍。
    现在，各工厂职工业余学校，在各级党委领导下，大抓巩固提高工作，为了使教学工作更好地为生产服务，组织技术员和师生编选新的教材，并把专职教师下放到车间，跟班生产，了解生产过程，更好地结合生产特点编写教材和开展教学工作，使工人既能学以致用，又能学习系统的文化知识。
