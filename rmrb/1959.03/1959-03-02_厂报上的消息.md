    News from the Factory Newspaper
    The ink is not yet dry, the smell of printing ink fills the air. A freshly printed mimeographed newspaper is passed from worker to worker. Short articles, eye-catching headlines, clear ideas, and moving sentences are like the loudest horn, announcing the latest news of the Great Leap Forward. Who was in the lead yesterday? Who is number one today? Which group is riding a rocket? Which group is flying in an airplane? Why did he fall behind? How can you help him catch up? Everyone is an interview subject, and everyone is a reporter and editor. The news in the factory newspaper is the strongest torch. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, it is burning inside and outside the workshop, spewing out a wave of surging heat! The news in the factory newspaper is the reddest red flag. In the blossoming spring, it raises joy on people's faces that will never fade! The ink is not yet dry, the smell of printing ink fills the air. Freshly printed mimeographed newspapers are passed from worker to worker, passed from worker to worker!

    厂报上的消息
    李学鳌墨迹未干，油香扑鼻，一张刚出版的铅印小报，在工人手里传递。短小的文章，醒目的标题，鲜明的思想，动听的字句，像一支最响的喇叭，向人们宣告大跃进的最新消息；昨天谁领先？今天谁第一？哪组乘火箭？哪组坐飞机？他为什么落后了？你怎样帮他赶上去？人人是采访的对象，人人又是记者、编辑。厂报上的消息，是最强的火炬，在大跃进的高潮中，是它燃烧得车间内外，喷着一片腾腾热气！厂报上的消息，是最红的红旗，在春暖花开的春天，是它给人们脸上，扬起永不散落的欢喜！墨迹未干，油香扑鼻，一张张刚出版的铅印小报啊，在工人手里传递，传递！
