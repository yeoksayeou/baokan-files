Seize the Peak Hatching Season and Quickly Incubate Poultry
Hunan, Hebei and Six Other Provinces Have Already Incubated More Than 20 Million Hatching Eggs

(Report from our newspaper) Many regions are responding to the call made at the National Poultry On-Site Conference to "Work hard for three months and focus all efforts on spring hatching," and are rapidly launching spring hatching work. According to statistics from Hunan, Hebei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces as of mid-March, more than 25.07 million hatching eggs have been incubated. According to incomplete statistics from Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangsu, Tianjin and other provinces and cities, more than 8.738 million chicks have hatched.

Strong leadership and early action are features of spring hatching in many regions this year. Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Ningxia, Heilongjiang and other provinces and regions started incubation training classes as early as January to carry out spring hatching work. Hebei, Sichuan and other provinces also held poultry on-site conferences in late March, including content to promote spring hatching work.

In order to quickly complete the spring hatching task, many regions, while mobilizing the masses to adopt various methods of incubation, have also promoted some indigenous and foreign combined incubation tools. The kang-heated egg incubator from the Tianjin Food Company Poultry Farm, the water-heated incubator from the Songhua River Branch of Northeast Agricultural College, and the kitchen-style incubator from Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu, are all good incubation tools that are easy to operate, save labor, have large incubation capacity, and are easy to master technically. Many regions have greatly improved incubation efficiency by improving incubation tools.

Many counties and communes have promptly resolved some common problems in the spring hatching work, such as the small number of poultry eggs and the low fertilization rate of hatching eggs.

    抓住孵化旺季快孵家禽
    湖南、河北等六省已孵种卵二千多万个
    本报讯　许多地区响应全国家禽现场会议所提出的“大干三个月，全力抓春孵”号召，迅速地开展了春孵工作。据湖南、河北、安徽、浙江、江苏、河南等省截至3月中旬的统计，已孵种蛋二千五百零七万多个；另据湖南、四川、福建、安徽、江苏、天津等省、市不完全统计，已出雏八百七十三万八千多只。
    领导部门抓得紧，动手早，是今年许多地区春孵的一个特点。陕西、山西、河北、宁夏、黑龙江等省、区，为了开展春孵工作，早在1月份就开办了孵化训练班。河北、四川等省还在3月下旬分别召开了包括推动春孵工作内容的家禽现场会议。
    许多地区为了迅速完成春孵任务，在发动群众采用多种多样方法孵化的同时，还推广了部分土洋结合的孵化工具。天津市食品公司家禽场的火炕孵卵器、东北农学院松花江分院的水暖孵化器、江苏江都县小纪人民公社的厨式孵化器等，都是操作简便、节省劳力、孵化量大、技术容易掌握的孵化好工具。许多地区由于改进孵化工具，大大提高了孵化效率。
    不少县、社在春孵工作中，都及时地解决了一些带有普遍性的问题，如禽卵不多，种卵受精率低等。
