Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 28th: The Japanese Socialist Party submitted a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to the House of Representatives this afternoon.

    Socialist Party member Uichiro Ito stated at the plenary session of the House of Representatives that the Socialist Party's reasons for submitting a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet are: the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet pursues a policy hostile to China and implements a foreign policy subordinate to the United States; it carries out nuclear armament and distorts the interpretation of the constitution in an attempt to legalize this nuclear armament. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet also implements economic policies aimed at rearmament.

    Ito also pointed out that in domestic affairs, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet implements reactionary education policies and fascist policies to suppress the workers' movement, and is also corrupt.

    Socialist Party member Koichi Yamamoto expressed support for the motion of no confidence. He said that the amendment to the "Police Duties Execution Law" proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet last year had already been crushed. According to the precedent of previous cabinets, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet should have stepped down long ago.

    He condemned Kishi Nobusuke for openly stating that he would amend Article 9 of the Constitution, which stipulates the prohibition of Japan possessing war potential, declaring that the Japanese Constitution "cannot restrict" U.S. forces stationed in Japan from carrying out nuclear armament and transporting nuclear weapons into Japan, and increasing the "Self-Defense Forces" under the guise of "defense."

    Yamamoto also condemned Kishi Nobusuke for refusing to support a resolution passed by the Diet regarding the prohibition of Japan carrying out nuclear armament.

    Yamamoto exposed the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's "tax reduction" scam. He pointed out that the price increases caused by the Kishi Nobusuke government's increase in gasoline tax, etc., have instead caused many families' incomes and expenditures to run deficits, resulting in a tax increase. He also pointed out that corruption cases in the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet are endless.

    Yamamoto demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet step down.

    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, relying on its majority seats, rejected the Socialist Party's motion of no confidence.

    日本社会党在国会众院
    对岸内阁提出不信任案
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午向国会众议院提出了对岸信介内阁的不信任案。
    社会党议员伊藤卯四郎在众议院全体会议上说，社会党对岸信介内阁提出不信任案的理由是：岸信介内阁实行敌视中国的政策，执行从属于美国的外交政策；实行核武装，并且歪曲解释宪法，企图使这种核武装合法化。岸信介内阁还实行目的在于重新武装的经济政策。
    伊藤还指出，在内政方面，岸信介内阁执行反动的教育政策和镇压工人运动的法西斯政策，并且贪污。
    社会党议员山本幸一表示支持不信任案。他说，去年岸信介内阁提出的“警察官职务执行法”修正案已经被粉碎了。根据历届内阁的惯例，岸信介内阁早就应该下台了。
    他谴责岸信介公然表示要修改宪法中规定禁止日本保有战争力量的第九条，宣称日本宪法“不能限制”驻日美军进行核武装和向日本运入核武器，并且假借“防卫”的名义，增强“自卫队”。
    山本还谴责岸信介拒绝支持由国会通过关于规定禁止日本实行核武装的决议。
    山本揭露了岸信介内阁的“减税”骗局。他指出，由于岸信介政府提高汽油税等而造成的物价上涨，反而使许多家庭的收支产生赤字，造成增税的结果。他并且指出，岸信介内阁的贪污案件层出不穷。
    山本要求岸信介内阁下台。
    执政的自由民主党依仗它的多数议席，否决了社会党的这个不信任案。
