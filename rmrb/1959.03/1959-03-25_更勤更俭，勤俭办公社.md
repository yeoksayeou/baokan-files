The principle of diligence and frugality is the fundamental principle for our country to carry out socialist construction; practicing thrift is the fundamental method for socialist enterprises to carry out internal accumulation. The broad masses of the Chinese people are very familiar with and warmly support the Party's policy of building the country diligently and frugally, running communes diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally. In the past ten years since the founding of the country, relying on this policy, the Chinese people have not only quickly healed the serious wounds of war, but also enabled our country's socialist construction to develop at a high speed. In 1958, under the guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, the Chinese people highly promoted the spirit of diligence and frugality, worked hard and skillfully with soaring revolutionary energy, and achieved great victories in socialist construction, resulting in an all-round great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The broad masses of peasants fighting on the agricultural front have not only enabled our country's agricultural production to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest, but also found the people's commune, the best organizational form for accelerating our country's socialist construction. Now, the task before the national peasants and all the people's communes is how to make more rational use of the powerful material forces of the unprecedented bumper harvest, and how to give full play to the enormous superiority unique to the people's communes. That is to say, in the new situation, how to realize the greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production proposed by the Party Central Committee according to the principle of running communes diligently and frugally and running all undertakings diligently and frugally.

The bumper harvest and communization have brought new content to the principle of diligence and frugality, and have put forward new requirements for us to implement this policy. The unprecedented bumper harvest has rapidly enriched the vast rural areas of our country. Compared with the advanced countries in the world, this kind of affluence is still at a very low level; compared with the lofty ideals of our people, it is still far behind, but compared with the past, it is unprecedentedly rich and powerful. The realization of communization, from a single, small-scale agricultural cooperative, has developed into a large-scale people's commune that closely combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and comprehensively develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The strength has become unprecedentedly powerful. Many things that the agricultural cooperatives could not do or could not do well in the past can now be started by the people's communes. Faced with this new situation, people are prone to have two kinds of views and ideas, and thus have two completely different attitudes and practices. Some people think that since there has been a bumper harvest and communization, it is no longer necessary to emphasize the principle of diligence and frugality so much; things can be done "generously," and there is no need to be meticulous and "nitpicky." However, the broad masses of cadres and working people believe that: after the bumper harvest and communization, not only should there be no extravagance and waste, but they should cherish their labor results even more, make more rational use of the people's commune's human, material, and financial resources, be more diligent, and go all out; be more frugal, and practice thrift vigorously. There is no doubt that the latter view and idea is completely correct.

Why? The reason is very simple. The people's commune is large in scale, with a large population and abundant resources, coupled with last year's bumper harvest, the strength is unprecedentedly strong, this is a fact; the people's commune operates a wide range of production undertakings, not only agriculture, but also industry, commerce, and various diversified economies, this is also a fact. However, precisely because of this, we especially need to emphasize the implementation of the principle of running communes diligently and frugally. Isn't the problem very obvious? After the family and business become large, first, it is easy to produce the idea of "not caring much"; second, a slight negligence will cause great waste, and a little attention will increase a lot of income. Taking manpower as an example, each commune has tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people. A large population is a great thing, and one of the main signs that the people's commune has great superiority, but only when we make reasonable use of such strong manpower can the superiority of the people's commune be fully realized. Now, the people's commune not only operates many production undertakings, but also runs many welfare undertakings, each commune has hundreds of public canteens, dozens of nurseries, homes for the elderly, and many other service undertakings. If each public canteen and nursery uses one or two more people, it may not seem like much; but, added together, it is hundreds or even thousands of people. Similarly, rationally organizing the labor force, thinking of ways to improve work methods, and reforming tools, so that each canteen and nursery can reduce one or two or three to five people, it will be possible to free up thousands of people to strengthen the production front. Thousands of people, what a huge force this is. Taking material resources as an example, after the bumper harvest, there is more grain, and the vast rural areas have implemented a food supply system or a grain supply system where "eating does not cost money," which is certainly a great thing. If, as a result, no attention is paid to thrift, as long as each canteen wastes some grain, it will cause alarming waste; similarly, with a little attention, we can save a lot of grain and make our lives even better. Here is the fact of Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province: When this commune first established a public canteen last year, because some people did not pay attention to saving grain, in just two months, only two production teams wasted more than 10,000 catties of grain. At the beginning of this year, after they implemented the method of planned grain use with fixed quotas per person and savings belonging to the individual, in two months, more than 100 production teams in the entire commune saved a total of more than 370,000 catties of grain, and almost every household had grain reserves, and they ate even better than before. Taking financial resources as an example, it is true that the commune has more income and more money, but the areas of expenditure are also wide, and the amount of expenditure is also large. One entry and one exit often involve thousands or tens of thousands of yuan.

Here is the situation of Weiting Commune in Wuxian County, Jiangsu: This year, the commune launched a tree planting and afforestation campaign and wanted to buy 100,000 tree saplings. If the tree saplings were delivered to the commune by others, each tree sapling would cost 6 jiao. The commune calculated that the expenditure was too large and did not meet the principle of thrift. It mobilized the members to transport them themselves, and each one only cost 3 jiao. By being more diligent, they saved 30,000 yuan at once. From these many facts, it can be seen that after communization and production development, there should not be any extravagance and waste, but should be more diligent and frugal, more meticulous; more rational use of their human, material, and financial resources; and make every effort to reduce costs and save expenses. In this way, we can concentrate more and stronger human, material, and financial resources to develop our production undertakings, increase income, and better improve the lives of the members.

The policy of running communes diligently and frugally and running all undertakings diligently and frugally is a policy of actively developing production, and a policy of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. Implementing the policy of diligence and frugality is, of course, to save a lot of human, material, and financial resources. However, this does not mean that we should not use what should be used, or not use more when more should be used. We advocate reducing non-production personnel; advocate reducing non-productive expenditures; advocate reducing productive expenditures that can be reduced; advocate not rushing to build office buildings and clubs; advocate not establishing professional performing arts troupes and drama troupes, etc., in order to make more rational use of the commune's human, material, and financial resources. Suspending or postponing some undertakings that are not needed today is to create conditions for starting these undertakings faster and better tomorrow. Therefore, our policy of diligence and frugality, our policy of vigorously practicing thrift, is linked to our general policy of accelerating socialist construction, is linked to the wishes and demands of our people, and is linked to the fundamental task of our people in building socialism. The people's commune should give full play to its unique advantages of being both "large" and "public," make more rational use of its own human, material, and financial resources, and promote the faster development of the commune's various production undertakings, especially agricultural production.

To correctly implement the principle of running communes diligently and frugally, we must rely on the correct understanding of the policy of running communes diligently and frugally by all commune staff and the broad masses of members, and also rely on the commune's sound management system. With a correct understanding and a sound organizational guarantee, the policy of running communes diligently and frugally can be more effectively and comprehensively implemented. Every people's commune should further establish and improve the planned management system. This planned management is manifested in the use of labor, that is, rationally organizing the labor force and minimizing non-direct production personnel according to the commune's production tasks; and implementing quota management and responsibility systems in various labor organizations, clearly stipulating individual labor quotas and collective labor quotas for groups or production teams, and truly achieving "everyone has something to do, and everything has someone to do." In terms of the use of financial and material resources, we should strengthen the commune's financial management, promote the economic accounting system, save expenses and reduce costs as much as possible, and ensure that every penny and every item of the commune can play its greatest effect. Only in this way can we concentrate enough human, material, and financial resources to develop the production undertakings of the people's commune faster; only in this way can we give fuller play to the superiority of the people's commune and promote the faster development of social productive forces in our country.

In the past, when our production was still very backward and materials were still very scarce, we relied on the policy of building the country diligently and frugally, running communes diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally, overcame countless difficulties, and rapidly developed our rural economy; now, when our production has greatly improved, our material strength has become stronger, especially after having the social organization of the people's commune with great superiority, further implementing the policy of running communes diligently and frugally will surely make the economy of the people's commune develop faster, better, and more comprehensively, and will surely make the lives of all members get greater improvement with the rapid development of production.

### 更勤更俭，勤俭办公社

    更勤更俭，勤俭办公社
    勤俭的原则，是我国进行社会主义建设的根本原则；厉行节约，是社会主义企业进行内部积累的根本方法。我国广大人民对党的勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针是十分熟悉和热烈拥护的。建国十年来，我国人民依靠这条方针，不仅迅速地医治了严重的战争创伤，而且使我国的社会主义建设高速度地发展了起来。1958年，我国人民在党的建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，高度地发扬了勤俭的精神，以冲天的革命干劲，实干苦干巧干，取得了社会主义建设的伟大胜利，出现了工农业生产全面大跃进。奋战在农业战线上的广大农民，不仅使我国的农业生产获得了空前的大丰收，而且找到了人民公社这个加速我国社会主义建设的最好的组织形式。现在，摆在全国农民、全国人民公社面前的任务是，如何更合理地利用空前大丰收的强大的物质力量、如何充分地发挥人民公社所特有的巨大优越性，也就是说，在新的情况下如何根据勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的原则，实现党中央提出来的农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进。
    大丰收，公社化，给勤俭的原则带来了新的内容，给我们执行这个方针提出了新的要求。空前大丰收，使我国广大乡村迅速富裕起来。这种富裕同世界上先进的国家比较起来，虽然水平还是很低的；同我国人民的远大理想比较起来，虽然还差得很远，但是同过去比较起来，却是空前富裕和强大了。公社化的实现，由单一的、规模较小的农业社，发展成工农商学兵各项事业密切结合、农林牧副渔全面发展的规模很大的人民公社，力量是空前地强大起来了，农业社过去不能办、办不好的许多事情，人民公社也能开始兴办了。面对着这种新的情况，人们容易产生两种看法和想法，因而也就产生两种截然不同的态度和做法。有人认为，大丰收了，公社化了，可以不必再十分强调勤俭的原则了；办事情可以“大方”些了，不必再精打细算、“斤斤计较”了。但是广大的干部和劳动人民却认为：丰收了，公社化了，不仅不应该产生任何铺张浪费的思想，反而应该更加珍惜自己的劳动果实，更加合理地利用人民公社的人力、物力和财力，更要勤，更要鼓足干劲；更要俭，更要厉行节约。毫无疑问，后一种看法和想法是完全正确的。
    为什么呢？道理很简单。人民公社规模大，人多、资源丰富，再加上去年大丰收，力量空前强大了，这是事实；人民公社经营的生产事业很广泛，不仅有农业，还有工业、商业和各种各样的多种经济，这也是事实。但是，正因为如此，我们才特别需要强调贯彻勤俭办社的原则。问题不是十分明显吗？家大业大以后，第一，容易产生“不大在乎”的思想；第二，稍一疏忽，就会造成很大的浪费，略加注意又会增加很大的收入。以人力为例，每个公社都有几万人甚至十几万人。人多，这是一件大好事，是人民公社具有巨大优越性的主要标志之一，但是只有当我们把这样雄厚的人力合理地运用起来的时候，人民公社的优越性才能充分发挥出来。现在，人民公社不仅经营着很多的生产事业，也举办着很多的生活福利事业，每个公社都有几百个公共食堂，几十个托儿所、敬老院和很多别的服务性事业。如果在每一个公共食堂和托儿所多用一两个人，看起来好像不算什么；但是，加到一起就是几百人甚至上千人。同样，合理地把劳动力组织一下，想法改进一下工作方法，改革一下工具，每个食堂和托儿所因而减少一两个或者三五个人，就能够腾出几千人去加强生产战线。几千人，这是一支多么巨大的力量。再以物力为例，大丰收以后粮食多了，广大乡村实行了“吃饭不要钱”的伙食供给制或者粮食供给制，这当然更是天大的好事。如果因此就不再注意节约，只要每个食堂浪费一些粮食，就会造成惊人的浪费；同样，稍加注意，就能够使我们节约下很多的粮食，使我们的生活得到更大的改善。这里是河北省遵化县建明人民公社的事实：这个社在去年刚成立公共食堂的时候，因为有些人不注意节约粮食，在两个月的时间内，仅仅两个生产队就浪费了粮食一万多斤。今年初，他们实行了以人定量、节约归己的计划用粮办法后，两个月全公社一百多个生产队就一共节省了三十七万多斤粮食，几乎家家都有了存粮，而且比过去吃得更好。再以财力为例，公社收入多、钱多，这是事实，但开支的方面也广，开支的数量也大。一进一出，常常是几千元、几万元。
    这里是江苏吴县唯亭公社的事情：今年这个社开展植树造林运动要买十万树秧，要是由别人把树秧送到公社，一棵树秧要六角钱，公社一计算，开支太大不合节约原则，发动社员自己去运，一棵只合三角钱，自己多勤劳一点，一下就节省了三万元。从这许多事实中可以看出：公社化以后，生产发展了以后，不仅不应该产生任何铺张浪费的现象，而且应该更勤更俭，更加精打细算；更要合理地运用自己的人力、物力和财力；更要千方百计地降低成本、节约开支。这样，我们就能够集中更多更雄厚的人力、物力和财力去发展我们的生产事业，增加收入，更好地改善社员生活。
    勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，是一个积极发展生产的方针，是更多更快更好更省地进行社会主义建设的方针。执行勤俭的方针，当然是为了节省很多的人力、物力和财力。但是，这并不是说该用不用、该多用不多用。我们主张减少非生产人员；主张缩减非生产性的开支；主张缩减能够缩减的生产性的开支；主张先不要忙着盖办公大楼、俱乐部；主张不要成立专业的文工团、剧团等等，是为了更合理的利用公社的人力、物力和财力。停办、缓办一些今天还不太需要的事业，是为了明天更快更好地兴办这些事业创造条件。因此，我们的勤俭方针，我们的厉行节约方针，是同我们加速社会主义建设的总的方针联系在一起的，是同我国人民的愿望、要求联系在一起的，是同我国人民建设社会主义的根本任务联系在一起的。人民公社应该充分发挥它特有的又“大”又“公”的优越性，更合理地利用自己的人力、物力和财力，促进公社的各项生产事业，首先是农业生产更快的发展。
    正确地贯彻勤俭办社的原则，要依靠全体公社工作人员和广大社员对勤俭办社的方针的正确认识，也要依靠公社的健全的经营管理制度。有了正确的认识，又有了健全的组织保证，勤俭办社的方针才能更有效地全面地贯彻。每个人民公社都应该进一步建立和健全计划管理制度。这种计划管理表现在劳力使用方面，是根据公社的生产任务，合理地组织劳动力和尽量减少非直接生产人员；并在各个劳动组织中实行定额管理和责任制，要明确规定个人劳动定额和小组或生产队的集体劳动定额，要真正做到“事事有人作，人人有事作”。表现在财力、物力使用方面，则应该加强公社的财务管理，推行经济核算制，尽量节省开支、降低成本，保证公社的一钱一物都能发挥它最大的效用。只有这样，我们才能够集中足够的人力、物力和财力，更快地发展人民公社的生产事业；只有这样，我们才能够更充分地发挥人民公社的优越性，促进我国社会生产力的更快发展。
    过去，当我们的生产还很落后，物资还很缺乏的时候，我们依靠着勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，克服了无数困难，使我们的农村经济迅速地发展起来；现在，当我们的生产已经有了很大提高，物质力量已经更加强大，特别是有了人民公社这样的具有巨大优越性的社会组织以后，进一步贯彻勤俭办社的方针，一定会使人民公社的经济更快更好更全面地发展起来，一定会使全体社员的生活随着生产的迅速发展获得更大的改善。
