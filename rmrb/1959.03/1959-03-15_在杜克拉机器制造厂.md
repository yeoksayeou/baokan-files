    At the Dukla Machine Works
    By Our Correspondent Yang Yi
      An Old Factory with a Glorious History
    Anyone who has been to Czechoslovakia has probably heard of the ČKD Dukla factory. It is one of the largest machine manufacturing plants in Czechoslovakia and also a historically significant factory in Prague. It has written a glorious chapter in the history of the Czechoslovak workers' movement. Due to its glorious tradition of struggle and its outstanding contributions to production after liberation, the Dukla factory has been repeatedly rewarded by the Party and the government. In 1957, when the factory celebrated its 125th anniversary, it was awarded the country's highest honor - the Klement Gottwald Order of Socialist Labor.
    Before the war, the Dukla factory produced a wide variety of products, mainly including sugar refinery equipment, hydraulic presses, and steam boilers. After liberation, it specialized in the production of power equipment, including steam boilers and other power station equipment. The Dukla factory also manufactured a large number of machines and equipment for China.
    Remarkable Results of Industrial Management Reform
    When the reporter visited this famous factory, the director, Josef Ježek, received us in his simple and elegant office. He is a calm and modest person with rich experience in struggle and outstanding management skills. Therefore, he always completes the tasks entrusted to him by the Party very well.
    The conversation began with how the Dukla factory was implementing the Party and government's new plan for the reform of national economic management. Director Ježek told us that the industrial management reform, which began in April 1958, gave the factory greater power than before in planning and arranging its production. Therefore, it was possible to mobilize all positive factors to better complete the tasks stipulated by the state. Last year, the Dukla factory overfulfilled its total output value by 9%, commodity production exceeded the plan by 7%, labor productivity increased by 7.5% compared with 1957, and the profit plan was fulfilled by 102%.
    Director Ježek emphasized that the main reason for achieving such good results was the promotion of the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses and the development of socialist labor emulation. Last year, the factory's profit plan was originally not easy to complete, but with the conscious efforts of the workers, it not only completed but also overfulfilled the original task.
    The factory's Party organization played a decisive role in mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm. It maintained close contact with the workers, led the development of the emulation movement, and conducted monthly summaries and formulated the next steps in the plan. The Party organization also implemented the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and carried out political and ideological education of the workers through various methods such as Party classes, report meetings, and production meetings.
    The Superiority of Planning and Financial Reform
    Turning to the topic of the national economic planning and financial reform that began in January this year, Director Ježek, based on his own experience in his work, talked about the correctness and advantages of this plan of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He said that the biggest benefit of the planning reform is that it encourages enterprises to attach importance to the role of long-term plans and long-term planning, to formulate annual production plans in a timely manner, and to fully utilize the enthusiasm of the working masses. Before the reform, the annual plans of enterprises were formulated and issued by the central ministries. Factories only cared about immersing themselves in production, regardless of national needs and the requirements of other departments, and without considering their own technological development and expanded reproduction. Now the factory's long-term plan (1960-1965) is drafted by the factory itself based on the main indicators stipulated by the government and the Ministry of Heavy Machine Building and the basic construction plans approved by the government. The long-term regulations do not specify specific indicators, but the factory itself decides the direction of future production development according to the long-term plan and production situation.
    In the past, the workers of the Dukla factory could only know the annual production plan issued by the ministry at the beginning of each year, and had no opportunity to put forward their own opinions. After the reform, the annual plan independently formulated by the enterprise is issued to the workers for extensive discussion half a year before the start of the year, and is revised according to their opinions. For example, the Dukla factory has now formulated its production plan for 1960, which will be submitted to the workers for full discussion in the coming months.
    The Dukla factory also has its own research and development department, which formulates its own technological development plan. This year, it will start working on about 50 research tasks according to the needs of the factory, so that its products fully meet international standards.
    Director Ježek went on to talk about the financial reform. Starting this year, the factory can for the first time have financial relations with the bank and apply to the bank for loans according to its production tasks and plans. In this way, the factory has its own far more flexible accounting system, which is greatly beneficial to the development of production. Another benefit of the financial reform is that a part of the factory's profits and excess profits will be allocated to the factory as the factory fund. The factory can use a part of this money to expand production and update equipment, and another part directly as production bonuses for the workers. Director Ježek believes that the new financial system correctly uses the law of economic incentives and can encourage factory leaders and the working masses to produce faster, better, and more economically.
    After introducing in detail the situation of the factory's planning and financial reform, Director Ježek excitedly told us that the superiority of the factory's industrial reform has been shown in this year's production plan and practice. According to the plan, the total output value of the Dukla factory will increase by 18% this year compared with last year, and commodity production will increase by 16%. Although this is a considerable figure, the new economic management plan and the workers' great enthusiasm have provided all the necessary prerequisites for the completion and over-completion of this year's tasks. For example, in January, the Dukla factory overfulfilled its original plan for total output value and commodity production.
    Strongly Supporting China's Power Industry
    45% of the Dukla factory's products are produced for the foreign market. China is also one of its important customers. It supplies China with many steam boilers and other power station equipment every year. The Dukla factory also supplies China with technical data on steam boilers according to the Sino-Czechoslovak Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement. At present, the Shanghai Boiler Factory has started producing this kind of steam boiler according to its blueprints.
    When we walked into the huge workshop, we saw a long line of steam boiler parts. These are all produced for the Shanghai Boiler Factory and will be shipped to China in the first half of this year. In order to adapt to China's specific conditions, the boilers produced by the Dukla factory for China can use coal instead of oil as fuel. At present, Czechoslovakia is the only country in the world that can produce this kind of boiler.
    An old worker in the workshop told us that last summer, in order to complete a batch of Chinese orders in a timely manner, many workers voluntarily postponed their vacations and rushed to finish the work first. They produced thirty boilers for China last year.

    在杜克拉机器制造厂
    本报记者　杨翊
      具有光辉历史的老厂
    到过捷克斯洛伐克的人大概都听说过捷卡德——杜克拉工厂的名字。它是捷克斯洛伐克大型机器制造厂之一，也是布拉格市一座历史悠久的工厂。在捷克斯洛伐克工人运动史上，它曾写下了光辉的一页。由于它的光荣斗争传统和解放后在生产上的卓越贡献，杜克拉工厂曾多次得到党和政府的奖励。在1957年，当工厂庆祝成立一百二十五周年的时候，还荣获了国家的最高奖赏——哥特瓦尔德社会主义祖国建设勋章。
    在战前，杜克拉工厂的产品种类很多，主要的有炼糖厂设备，水压机和汽锅等。解放后它专门生产电力设备，包括汽锅和电站的其他装置。杜克拉工厂还为中国制造大批机器设备。
    工业管理改组卓著成效
    在记者到这个著名的工厂访问的时候，厂长约瑟夫·叶皆克在他陈设简单大方的办公室里接见了我们。他是一位沉静而朴实的人，有丰富的斗争经验，也有出色的管理才能。因此总是很好地完成了党付托给他的任务。
    谈话是从杜克拉工厂怎样执行党和政府关于国民经济管理改组的新方案开始的。叶皆克厂长告诉我们，1958年4月开始实施的工业管理改组，使工厂在计划和安排自己的生产方面有了较前更大的权力，因之有可能调动一切积极因素来更好地完成国家规定的任务。去年杜克拉工厂生产总值超额完成了9％，商品生产超过计划7％，劳动生产率比1957年提高7.5％，利润计划完成了102％。
    叶皆克厂长强调说明，取得这样良好成果的主要原因，是发扬了工人群众的积极性和创造性，以及开展了社会主义劳动竞赛。去年工厂利润计划本来不易完成，但是在工人们的自觉努力下，不仅完成而且超额完成了原定的任务。
    工厂党组织在发动工人积极性方面起了决定性的作用。它和工人们保持着密切的联系，领导着竞赛运动的开展，按月进行总结和制订下一步的规划。党组织还通过党课学习、报告会、生产会议等各种方式，贯彻捷共中央的决定和进行对工人的政治思想教育。
    计划和财务改组的优越性
    话题转到从今年1月开始执行的国民经济计划和财务改组方面，叶皆克厂长根据自己在工作中的体会，谈到捷共中央这一方案的正确性和优点。他说，计划改组的最大好处是促使企业重视远景计划和长期规划的作用，及时制订年度生产计划以及充分发挥工人群众的积极性。改组前企业年度计划由中央各部制定颁发，工厂只顾埋头生产，不管国家需要和其它部门的要求，也不考虑本身的技术发展和扩大再生产。现在工厂的远景计划（1960—1965年）由工厂根据政府和重型机器制造部规定的主要指标和政府批准的基本建设计划来自行拟定。长期规定中不规定具体指标，只由工厂自己按照远景计划和生产情况决定今后生产发展的方向。
    过去杜克拉工厂的工人只是在每年年初才能知道由部里发下的年度生产计划，没有机会再提出自己的意见。改组后，企业独立拟定的年度计划在年度开始前半年就发给工人们进行广泛的讨论，并根据他们的意见加以修改。例如杜克拉工厂现已订出1960年的生产计划，将在今后几个月中提交工人们去充分讨论。
    杜克拉工厂还有自己的研究和发展部门，自己制定技术发展计划。今年它将根据工厂的需要着手解决约五十项研究任务，以使自己的产品完全达到国际标准。
    叶皆克厂长接着谈到有关财务改组的问题。从今年起，工厂第一次可以同银行发生财务关系，按照自己的生产任务和计划向银行要求贷款。这样工厂就有了自己远为机动灵活的会计制度，大大有利于生产的发展。财务改组的另一好处是工厂利润和超额利润的一部分将拨交工厂作为工厂基金，厂方可以把这笔钱的一部分用来扩大生产和更新设备，另一部分直接作为工人的生产奖金。叶皆克厂长认为，新的财务制度正确利用了经济刺激的法则，能鼓励工厂领导和工人群众都更快、更好、更省地进行生产。
    在详尽介绍了工厂计划和财务改组的情形后，叶皆克厂长兴奋地告诉我们，工厂工业改组的优越性已从今年生产的计划和实践中显示出来。按照计划，杜克拉工厂今年生产总值将比去年增加18％，商品生产增长16％。虽然这是一个可观的数字，但经济管理的新方案和工人的巨大热情，已为今年任务的完成和超额完成提供了一切必要的前提。如在1月份，在杜克拉工厂就超额完成了原定的生产总值计划和商品生产计划。
    大力支援中国电力工业
    杜克拉工厂有45％的产品是为国外市场生产的。中国也是它的重要主顾之一。它每年供应中国许多汽锅和其他电站装备。杜克拉工厂还根据中捷科学技术合作协定供应中国有关蒸汽锅炉的技术资料。目前，上海锅炉厂已根据它的蓝图开始生产这种汽锅。
    当我们走进巨大的车间就看到一长列蒸汽锅炉的部件。这都是为上海锅炉厂生产的，今年上半年就将运往中国。为了适应中国的具体情况，杜克拉工厂为中国生产的锅炉都能用煤代替油作为燃料。在目前，捷克斯洛伐克是全世界唯一能生产这种锅炉的国家。
    车间中的一位老工人告诉我们，去年夏天为了及时完成一批中国订货，许多工人都自动推迟他们的假期，先把这批活赶了出来。他们去年为中国生产了三十个锅炉。
