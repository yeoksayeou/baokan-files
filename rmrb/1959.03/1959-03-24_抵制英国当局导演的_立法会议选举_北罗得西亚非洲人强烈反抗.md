Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd, Lusaka Dispatch: Africans in the Luapula region of Northern Rhodesia recently took action to resist the Legislative Council election directed by the British colonial authorities in Northern Rhodesia, and the election in this region has not yet taken place.

According to the British colonial authorities on the 21st, in the Ngumbo area of the Luapula region of Northern Rhodesia, approximately 200 Africans armed with spears gathered on the evening of the 18th to carry out resistance activities. Local colonial police used tear gas and arrested six Africans. However, this resistance was not suppressed, and people continued to gather. The colonial authorities sent reinforcements and arrested another twenty-eight Africans on the 21st.

This incident was reported while the British colonial authorities were vigorously touting the success of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council election. This election, directed by the British colonial authorities, took place on the 20th, but the true owners of Northern Rhodesia, more than two million Africans, had only seven thousand "voters" and could not possibly influence the election. Although the election results have not yet been fully announced, it is reported that the ruling party of the British colonialists, the United Federal Party, has already obtained a "majority."

In Nyasaland, the British colonial authorities are still frantically carrying out suppression. Colonial troops arrested another 160 Africans during a "sweep" in the Lilongwe district of the Central Province on the morning of the 22nd.

Reports say that the Nyasaland colonial authorities recently hastily built another concentration camp near Blantyre. This concentration camp can hold 750 people and currently holds 260 Africans.

The colonial air force from Southern Rhodesia again scattered 100,000 leaflets over the Northern Province of Nyasaland on the 21st, threatening the Africans who persisted in their struggle there.

According to reports from Salisbury, the British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, left Southern Rhodesia on the 21st and flew back to London. Perth spent nine days in the Central African Federation. The specific content of the activities has not been disclosed.

    抵制英国当局导演的“立法会议选举”
    北罗得西亚非洲人强烈反抗
    新华社23日讯　卢萨卡消息：北罗得西亚卢阿普拉地区的非洲人最近用行动抵制英国殖民当局在北罗得西亚导演的立法会议选举，这地区的选举到现在一直没有进行。
    据英国殖民当局21日透露，在北罗得西亚卢阿普拉地区的恩古姆波地方，18日晚上约有二百名手执长矛的非洲人聚集在一起进行反抗活动。当地殖民警察使用了催泪弹，并且逮捕了六个非洲人。但是，这一反抗并没有被镇压下去，人们仍旧聚集在一起。殖民当局派出了增援部队，在21日又逮捕了二十八个非洲人。
    这一事件是在英国殖民当局正在竭力吹嘘北罗得西亚立法会议选举成功的时候传出的。这个由英国殖民当局导演的选举在20日进行了一天，而北罗得西亚真正的主人两百多万非洲人只有七千名“选民”，根本不可能影响选举。虽然选举结果还没有全部公布，但是有消息说，英国殖民者的执政党统一联邦党已经获得“多数”。
    在尼亚萨兰，英国殖民当局仍在疯狂地进行镇压。殖民部队22日上午在中央省利郎格韦区的一次“扫荡”中，又逮捕了一百六十名非洲人。
    有消息说，尼亚萨兰殖民当局最近在布兰太尔附近又赶修了一座集中营。这座集中营可以关七百五十人，目前已经关有二百六十个非洲人。
    来自南罗得西亚的殖民空军21日又在尼亚萨兰北方省的上空散发了十万张传单，对在那里坚持斗争的非洲人进行威胁。
    据来自索耳兹伯里的消息说，英国协办殖民地事务国务大臣佩思已经在21日离开南罗得西亚飞回伦敦。佩思曾在中非联邦进行了九天活动。活动的具体内容，一直没有透露。
