Xinhua News Agency, 6th - A responsible person of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade today issued a statement regarding the Thai government's ban on the import of Chinese goods, saying that this extremely unfriendly behavior by the Thai government towards the Chinese people goes against the will of the Thai people and violates the spirit of the Bandung Conference. This behavior will only benefit American imperialism in creating tensions in Southeast Asia. The responsible person pointed out that this act of ingratitude by the Thai government will inevitably backfire.

The full text of the statement by the responsible person of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade is as follows:

    On January 17th of this year, the Thai government announced a ban on the import of goods from the People's Republic of China and forced merchants to sell all Chinese goods on the Thai market within thirty days, with severe penalties for those who disobey. Chinese goods have always been welcomed by the Thai people in the Thai market. Because the Thai government has adopted such a hostile policy towards China, Thai merchants who deal in Chinese goods have suffered significant losses. The current market chaos and rising prices in Thailand have aroused dissatisfaction among the Thai people, especially those in the industrial and commercial sectors. We have been closely monitoring the development of the situation.

    China and Thailand have a long history of trade relations. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Thai trade could not proceed because the Thai government implemented the American "embargo" policy. Since the Bandung Conference, as the Thai people's demand for trade with our country has grown, relevant Thai parties have also continuously requested trade with our country. Based on our consistent desire to develop trade with the Thai people to promote friendship between the two peoples, and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of needed goods, we began direct trade with Thailand. Since 1956, we have received representatives from Thai industrial and commercial circles and signed a number of trade contracts with them, purchasing some of the goods that were backlogged in Thailand at the time, and helping them solve some export difficulties. Obviously, this trade is beneficial to the Thai people. Although the volume of trade between China and Thailand has not been large in recent years, Thai officials have not denied that Chinese goods play a role in regulating price fluctuations in the Thai market.

    Now the Thai government disregards the interests of the Thai people, and barbarously sabotages the mutually beneficial Sino-Thai trade relations that have been initially established, and destroys the friendship between the people of China and Thailand that has been cultivated over the years. We cannot but regretfully point out that this is an extremely unfriendly act by the Thai government towards the Chinese people. This behavior goes against the will of the Thai people and violates the spirit of the Bandung Conference. This behavior will only benefit American imperialism in creating tensions in Southeast Asia. American imperialism is extremely unwilling to see the development of friendly relations between the people of China and Thailand. The Thai government's actions are in line with the intentions of American imperialism and will not bring any benefits to Thailand itself.

    Our country has always been willing to develop equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with Thailand on the basis of peaceful coexistence. Since Sino-Thai trade was initiated by the Thai side and is now being sabotaged by the Thai government, this will of course not have any impact on our country. On the contrary, this act of ingratitude by the Thai government will inevitably reap what it sows.

    我国际贸易促进委员会负责人就泰国禁止我商品进口发表谈话
    泰国破坏中泰贸易将自食其果
    这种行为违反万隆精神，只会有利于美国制造紧张局势
    新华社6日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会负责人今天就泰国政府禁止中国商品进口的问题发表谈话说，泰国政府对中国人民这种极不友好的行为是违背泰国人民的意志，也是违反万隆会议精神的。这种行为只会有利于美帝国主义在东南亚制造紧张局势。负责人指出，泰国政府这种以怨报德的行为，必将自食其果。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会负责人谈话的全文如下：
    泰国政府于本年1月17日宣布禁止中华人民共和国商品进口，并迫令商人把泰国市场上的中国商品在三十天内全部售出，对违令者将予严惩。中国商品在泰国市场上一向受到泰国人民的欢迎。由于泰国政府对中国采取这种敌视的政策，已使经营中国商品的泰国商人蒙受重大的损失。目前泰国市场混乱，物价上涨，已引起泰国人民尤其是工商界人士的不满。对此，我们一直是密切注视着事态的发展的。
    中泰两国是有悠久的贸易关系的，中华人民共和国成立后，由于泰国政府执行了美国的“禁运”政策，使中泰贸易无法进行。自从万隆会议以后，由于泰国人民要求同我国进行贸易的呼声日益高涨，泰国有关方面也连续向我国提出进行贸易的要求，我国本着一向同泰国人民发展贸易以促进两国人民友好的愿望，根据平等互利互通有无的原则，同泰国开始了直接贸易往来。1956年以来，我们曾接待了一些泰国工商界的代表，并且同他们签订了一些贸易合同，购买了当时在泰国一些积压商品，帮助他们解决了一些出口的困难。很显然，这种贸易对泰国人民是有益的。几年以来，中泰间的贸易额虽然不大，但泰国官员也不讳言中国商品在泰国市场上有调剂物价波动的作用。
    现在泰国政府不顾泰国人民的利益，对已初步建立起来的互利的中泰贸易关系蛮横地加以破坏，对几年来已培植起来的中泰两国人民的友谊，加以摧残，我们不能不遗憾地指出，这是泰国政府对中国人民极不友好的行为，这种行为是违背泰国人民的意志的，也是违反万隆会议精神的。这种行为，只会有利于美帝国主义在东南亚制造紧张局势。美帝国主义是极不愿意中泰两国人民发展友好关系的，泰国政府这种作法，正符合了美帝国主义的意图，对泰国本身决不会带来任何好处。
    我国一向愿意同泰国在和平共处的基础上发展平等互利的贸易关系。中泰贸易既然是由泰国方面提出来的，现在又遭到泰国政府的破坏，这对我国来说当然不会有任何影响，相反的，泰国政府这种以怨报德的行为，必将自食其果。
