    Complete Sets of Equipment

    The purpose of capital construction is to expand reproduction. How can we ensure that an industrial and mining enterprise is built and put into production? A basic condition is complete sets of equipment.

    A modern factory generally consists of three parts: basic production workshops, auxiliary workshops, and an in-plant transportation and communication system. Putting all the equipment needed for these workshops and transportation and communication systems together in a complete set is called a complete set of equipment.

    The basic production workshop is the main component of the factory, and the various equipment required by the basic production workshop is the main body of the factory's complete set of equipment. The equipment of the basic production workshop is composed of main equipment (referred to as the main machine) and auxiliary equipment (referred to as auxiliary machines). Taking a steel rolling workshop as an example, the rolling mill is the main machine; in addition to the rolling mill, many auxiliary machines are needed to cooperate with it, such as cranes, heating furnaces, steel pushers, roller tables, shears, straightening machines, and electrical control equipment, in order to carry out production.

    In order to ensure the production of the basic production workshop, a number of auxiliary workshops are also needed. The number of auxiliary workshops varies from factory to factory. The more common ones are machine repair workshops, laboratories, boiler rooms, gas stations, water supply stations, substations, compressed air stations, and oxygen stations. These auxiliary workshops also require a large number of equipment.

    In-plant transportation equipment refers to the various vehicles needed for transportation between and within the factory's workshops, which is also necessary to ensure the enterprise is put into production. In-plant communication equipment is also indispensable.

    The number of equipment and accessories required for complete sets of equipment for industrial and mining enterprises is large, and there are many types. The equipment required for iron and steel complexes and power stations is particularly complex. A set of 6,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment has more than 7,000 accessories surrounding the main machines such as boilers, steam turbines, and generators, of which more than 4,000 are more complex.

    Complete sets of equipment are composed of many single machines. Machines such as machine tools, water pumps, and cranes are all single machines. Single machines are composed of three parts: power, transmission, and operation. It cannot become a complete machine if one is missing. Therefore, a complete set of single machines is the basis of a complete set of equipment.

    设备成套
    基本建设的目的是扩大再生产。怎样保证一个工矿企业建成并且投入生产？一个基本的条件是设备成套。
    每一个现代化的工厂，一般都是由基本生产车间、辅助车间、厂内运输系统和通讯系统三部分构成的。把这些车间和运输、通讯系统所需要的设备全部配成套，就叫做设备成套。
    基本生产车间是工厂的主要构成部分，基本生产车间所需要的各种设备，是工厂设备成套的主体。基本生产车间的设备，是由主要设备（简称主机）和辅助设备（简称辅机）组成的。以轧钢车间为例，轧钢机是主机；除了轧钢机以外，还需要有许多辅机，如起重机、加热炉、推钢机、辊道、剪切机、矫正机和电气控制设备等与它相配合，才能进行生产。
    为了保证基本生产车间的生产，还需要有若干辅助车间。各种工厂的辅助车间多少不同，比较普遍的有机修车间，试验室，锅炉房，煤气站，供水站，变电站，压缩空气站和氧气站等。这些辅助车间也需要数量众多的设备。
    厂内运输设备是指厂内各车间之间、各车间内部的运输所需要的各种车辆，这也是保证企业投入生产所必需的，厂内通讯设备，也是不可缺少的。
    工矿企业设备成套所需要的设备和配件的数量很大，种类很多，钢铁联合企业和电站所需要的设备尤为复杂。一套六千瓩的火力发电设备，围绕着锅炉、汽轮机、发电机等主机的附件，共有七千多件，其中比较复杂的有四千多件。
    成套设备又是由很多单机组成的。像机床、水泵、吊车等都是单机。单机都是由原动、传动、作业三部分部件构成的，缺一就不能成为一部完整的机器。因此，单机的成套，是设备成套的基础。
