Heilongjiang Local Specialties

    Willow Grouse (Feilong)
    Despite its name, which suggests a flying beast, the willow grouse is actually a bird about the size of a sand grouse, common in grasslands and forests. It grows in the Huma and Xunke counties of the Heihe region in the northernmost part of China. Willow grouse meat is a famous delicacy, a prized ingredient for hot pot. When the hot pot is brought to the table, the water boils, and after adding the broth base (various seasonings) and thinly sliced pork and lamb, many bubbles appear. At this point, adding the willow grouse meat gives the hot pot a very rich and delicious flavor, making it a precious dish. During the Qing Dynasty, the people here presented willow grouse meat as a tribute during festivals; now, it has become something enjoyed by the people themselves.
   Elk (Handa'an)
    The elk is a rare animal in the forest regions of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. It resembles a cow but is taller and larger, runs well, and likes to eat tender willow branches. Elk do not harm people, nor do they have any particular fear of them. When they see people, they often stop to look before running, making them relatively easy to hunt. Elk hides can be used to sew soft high boots, which the locals call "Wengde." Paired with fur socks, they are light, convenient, and keep out the cold. Elk meat is as delicious as beef. In addition to eating elk meat, the Oroqen hunters also dry it to make jerky, which they keep for consumption during hunting trips. Elk nose is a famous dish, which can be stir-fried or braised and has a delicious taste.
    Chum Salmon (Dama Hama Yu)
    The chum salmon, also known as the salmon, is a specialty of the Heilongjiang River. This fish has a spindle-like shape and is one of the most beautiful of fish. It is about three feet long, with a greenish head, a bluish-gray back with black spots, and a silver-white belly. It looks a bit like a trout.
    Chum salmon meat is delicious and is ideal for smoking and canning. Residents along the Heilongjiang River and its tributary, the Ussuri River, where chum salmon are abundant, also use it to make dumplings. Chum salmon roe is different from ordinary fish roe; it is almost as large as dried fish oil pills, pink, and very beautiful. This meat can be eaten raw or cooked and is very nutritious.
    Gold-Line Frog (Jin Xian Wa)
    The gold-line frog is a specialty of Heilongjiang. It is a type of field frog, named for the golden lines on its back. The oil extracted from the gold-line frog is a valuable medicinal material and nutritional tonic.
    Originally, gold-line frogs were wild, found everywhere in rivers, ditches, and swamps. Last year, many people's communes in various counties began to regard artificial breeding of gold-line frogs as a new sideline production activity.
    More than ten counties, including Shangzhi, Wuchang, and Muling, have raised more than 20 million gold-line frogs, which can extract more than 100,000 jin of oil annually. The income from this sideline production is quite considerable. For example, the Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County, using natural conditions and artificial management methods, raised 200,000 gold-line frogs, increasing its income by more than 14,000 yuan a year.
    Sable (Zidiao)
    The three treasures of Northeast China are ginseng, mink fur, and Ula grass. Mink is one of the three treasures, mostly produced in the forests of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. It is a world-renowned precious fur. The sable's fur is very fine, soft, glossy, and beautifully colored, yellowish-black or with a purplish tint, hence the name purple sable or black sable. The sable's tail is very long, and the fur is most abundant. It is said that during the Han Dynasty, sable tails were used as crown ornaments worn by high officials.
    Sable fur has a high degree of cold resistance. If you wrap a pot of cold water in sable fur and place it in freezing temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze even after a day. Sable fur is mostly used for coat collars or as decorations for women's hats.
    To develop sable production, relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province have started artificial breeding. Last year, a large number of sables were bred in Hengdaohezi in Ning'an County and Yuquan in Acheng County, and many baby sables have already been born. (With pictures)

    黑龙江土特产
    飞龙
    听名字飞龙像是会飞的猛兽，其实它是和草原森林里常见的沙半鸡那样大小的一种飞禽。它生长在我国最北部的黑河地区呼玛县和逊克县一带。飞龙肉是名菜之一，是吃火锅的珍品，摆在餐桌上的火锅里的开水翻滚了，锅底（各种作料）和用刨子削得纸一样薄的猪肉和羊肉下过之后，锅里就冒出了很多泡沫，这时放上飞龙肉，火锅的味道非常淳厚鲜美，成为珍贵的佳肴。清朝时，逢年过节都要这里人民以飞龙肉作为贡品；现在则成为人民自己所享受的东西了。
   罕达犴
    罕达犴是大小兴安岭林区稀有的动物，样子像牛，但比牛高大，善跑，喜欢吃嫩柳枝。犴不伤人，对人也没有特殊的恐惧，当它看到人时，常常站下看看再跑，因此，猎取较为容易。犴皮可缝柔软的长统靴，当地人叫它“翁得”，配上毛皮袜子，穿起来又轻便又御寒。犴肉像牛肉一样的好吃。鄂伦春猎人除吃犴肉外，还晒成犴肉干，留作打猎时食用。犴鼻子是一种名菜，可溜可扒，味道鲜美。
    大马哈鱼
    大马哈鱼又名鲑鱼，是黑龙江的特产。这种鱼的形状很像一个纺锤，是鱼类里异常美丽的一种。体长大约三尺，头部带翠色，背部呈蓝灰色，并有黑色的斑点，腹部是银白色的，它的样子有一点像鳟鱼。
    大马哈鱼肉味鲜美，是熏制罐头的佳品，盛产大马哈鱼的黑龙江及其支流乌苏里江沿岸的居民，还用它包饺子吃，大马哈鱼籽和一般鱼籽不同，它几乎有鱼干油丸那样大，粉红色，非常好看。这种肉生食、熟食都可以，营养很丰富。
    金线蛙
    金线蛙是黑龙江的一种特产。它是田鸡的一种，因为背上有金线故名叫金线蛙。从金线蛙身上榨取的油，是贵重的医药材料和营养滋补品。
    金线蛙本来是野生的，河沟、泡沼到处都是。去年许多县的人民公社，已把人工饲养金线蛙作为一项新的副业生产内容。
    尚志、五常和穆棱等十多县，就饲养了二千多万只金线蛙，每年可提取十万多斤油。这项副业生产收入相当可观，如尚志县苇河人民公社，利用自然条件和人工管理办法就饲养二十万只金线蛙，一年增加收入就达一万四千多元。
    紫貂
    关东有三宝，人参貂皮靰鞡草。貂就是三宝之一，多产在大、小兴安岭森林里，是举世闻名的珍贵毛皮。貂的绒毛非常细密，柔软，光泽美丽，颜色黄黑或带紫色，故名紫貂或黑貂。紫貂尾巴很长，绒毛也最多。相传在汉朝的时期，曾用紫貂的尾巴，作为高官佩带的冠饰。
    貂皮具有高度的防寒能力，如果用貂皮包上一盆凉水，放在零下三十多度的严寒气温下，一天也不会结冰。貂皮多半用做大衣领子，或用作妇女帽子的装饰品。
    黑龙江省有关部门，为了发展紫貂的生产，已经开展了人工饲养。去年在宁安县横道河子和阿城县玉泉等地就饲养了大批紫貂，已经生了许多小紫貂了。（附图片）
