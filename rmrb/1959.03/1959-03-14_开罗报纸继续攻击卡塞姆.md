    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 12th: Cairo newspapers today all published on their front pages the speech given by UAR President Nasser in Damascus on the 11th, attacking Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem and the Iraqi Communist Party. Many newspapers used titles attacking Iraq, such as "Terror Rule in Baghdad," "The Attitude of Iraq's Kassem and Arab Traitors," and "Listen: Iraq's Kassem," etc.
    An editorial in "Al-Ahram" slandered Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem as a "hired agent" like former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said.
    "Al-Ahram's" correspondent in New York reported that many American radio and television stations broadcast the full text of Nasser's speech on the 11th. The correspondent also said that Washington diplomats were "deeply impressed by Nasser's speech, in which Nasser condemned the communists for accepting orders from abroad."

    开罗报纸继续攻击卡塞姆
    新华社开罗12日电　开罗各报今天都在头版刊载了阿联总统纳赛尔11日在大马士革发表的攻击伊拉克总理卡塞姆和伊拉克共产党的演说。许多报纸用了攻击伊拉克的标题，如“巴格达的恐怖统治”、“伊拉克的卡塞姆的态度和阿拉伯叛徒”、“听着：伊拉克的卡塞姆”等。
    “金字塔报”的社论诋毁伊拉克总理卡塞姆像伊拉克前首相努里·赛义德一样是“受人雇佣的代理人”。
    “金字塔报”驻纽约记者报道，美国的许多广播电台和电视台在11日广播了纳赛尔演说的全文。这位记者还说，华盛顿的外交官“对纳赛尔的演说获得十分深刻的印象，纳赛尔在这次演说中谴责共产党人从外国接受命令”。
