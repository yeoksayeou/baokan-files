Xinhua News Agency, March 7th. Over 8,000 women from all walks of life in the capital gathered with joy and excitement at the Beijing Gymnasium today to celebrate their festival, "March 8th" International Women's Day.

Red flags fluttered in front of the gymnasium, and women from all fronts arrived at the venue in their festive new clothes. The venue was decorated solemnly and beautifully. Huge banners hung on both sides of the rostrum, reading: "Women, join the people of the whole country and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!" "Women, contribute all your strength to achieving the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton proposed by the Party Central Committee!" The venue also displayed huge colored flags printed with peace doves and olive branches, expressing the women's love for a peaceful life.

The meeting was opened by Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Beijing Women's Federation. She first extended a warm welcome and respect to the leaders of the All-China Women's Federation, the Beijing Party, government and people's organizations, international friends, and women advanced figures from all fronts who attended the meeting. She then said: Today, as we commemorate our festival here, we feel even happier and more jubilant, because the socialist construction of the motherland achieved extremely great achievements in 1958. After introducing the great achievements made by women in the capital on all fronts, she called on women in the capital to continue to exert their utmost efforts and strive for the top, to contribute all their strength to completing and over fulfilling this year's production and construction tasks, to achieving the four major targets of steel, coal, grain and cotton, and to defending world peace.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting. She first extended festive greetings to the women of the capital and the whole country, and expressed sincere condolences and thanks to the female experts and experts' wives from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries who came to our country to help with construction. She then said that from "March 8th" last year to "March 8th" this year, this was an unprecedentedly great year since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Cai Chang listed the specific situations of the vast number of women in our country participating in various social production and labor, the socialization of housework, and the profound changes in the spiritual outlook of women, illustrating that the women's movement in our country has leapt to a new historical stage. After narrating the situation of women and men working together since the New Year of 1959, actively leaping forward on the industrial, agricultural and other fronts, Cai Chang said: When the masses of women are launching a production upsurge to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day, we must also see that this is only a good start for 1959, and to complete the country's construction plan for 1959, it must be achieved through the arduous efforts of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party. She asked women across the country to actively participate in the production movement centered on the technical revolution being carried out throughout the country, to actively participate in improving, consolidating and developing collective living welfare undertakings; to constantly improve their socialist and communist consciousness under the education of the Party; to pay attention to cultivating and promoting women's backbones; and to pay attention to protecting women's health while giving full play to their high production enthusiasm.

In conclusion, Cai Chang called on women across the country to contribute even greater strength to defending world peace while striving for a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward in domestic socialist construction.

The wife of the Ambassador of the People's Republic of Albania to China, Mrs. Balili, delivered a congratulatory speech to the meeting on behalf of the wives of the heads of missions and diplomats of various countries in China. She said: Today, when the forces of peace, freedom and social progress have grown invincible and the forces of imperialism and colonialism have reached the end of their rope, a bright and splendid prospect has unfolded before women, who constitute half of the world's population. Mrs. Balili said: We women are very concerned about progress and peace, because progress and peace are indispensable to human life and the future of mankind, and are indispensable to the future of our children. Mothers always do everything they can to nurture their children, even at the cost of sacrificing everything for them. In her speech, Mrs. Balili congratulated Chinese women on their greater achievements in all efforts to build a strong socialist new China and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Representatives of women from all walks of life in the capital reported to the meeting on their contributions on various fronts and their determination to strive for a greater leap forward this year. Zhao Shumin, a female worker from the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, where female workers account for more than 70%, said in her speech that last year, 540 advanced female workers emerged from their factory. In the first two months of this year, all the workers in the factory rushed to meet the three targets of output, quality, and conservation, and overfulfilled the plan in a balanced manner by week, by day, and by shift. Zhao Shumin said that they would hold high the red flag they had already won and realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Yu Jihui, deputy director of Songzhuang People's Commune in Tongzhou District, on behalf of the female members of the commune, proposed to the women of the entire suburban area at the meeting to carry out a friendship competition with the guarantee that more than 95% of the women with labor power in the entire commune would attend full time and run public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. well. Zhou Luo, deputy director of the Beijing Childcare Workers' Representative Conference, on behalf of the childcare sector in Beijing, said that this year they will continue to implement the policy of serving production and running kindergartens and nurseries frugally, and launch a red flag competition of "loving children and taking good care of children" to further consolidate and improve the existing childcare organizations.

On behalf of more than one million children and more than 400,000 Young Pioneers in the capital, they presented words of tribute to the meeting with moving poems, congratulating
"Mothers, Aunts, and Aunts for achieving even greater results this year."

After the meeting read out the "Appeal to the Women of the World by the Executive Bureau of the Women's International Democratic Federation," thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue, indicating that women from all walks of life in the capital, together with women across the country, warmly responded to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation and worked hard to immediately stop nuclear weapons testing, ban all nuclear weapons, and achieve disarmament.
