Anhui Province is transforming wild growth into domestic cultivation and establishing large numbers of Chinese medicinal herb farms.

(This report) The Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to the development of the production of Chinese medicinal materials. They have strengthened leadership over the medicinal material production departments in various regions and mobilized the broad masses to cultivate Chinese medicinal materials, thereby enabling the production of medicinal materials to achieve rapid development. Anhui Province is extremely rich in Chinese medicinal materials, with more than 700 varieties. Among them, the more precious products include Dendrobium officinale from Huoshan, Agastache rugosa and Gastrodia elata from the Dabie Mountains, deer antlers from She County, Jingde, and Qingyang, chrysanthemums from Chu County, She County, and Bo County, Chaenomeles speciosa from Xuancheng, and Coptis chinensis and pangolins from the mountainous areas of southern Anhui. The larger yielding products include white peony root, tree peony bark, and Poria cocos.

At present, the medicinal material departments in Anhui Province have established 50 medicinal material cultivation farms in various counties, with a total area of over 80,000 mu, some of which have been put into production one after another. Various localities rely on the people's communes to widely cultivate Chinese medicinal materials. Some people's communes have established specialized teams for collecting medicinal materials, capturing musk deer and deer, and collecting Dendrobium officinale. Some people's communes have also established medicinal material cultivation farms or harvesting and processing plants.

Currently, Anhui has converted 75 kinds of medicinal materials from wild to domestic cultivation, including Saposhnikovia divaricata, gallnut, Liriope spicata, sika deer, Pinellia ternata, and Dendrobium officinale. The cultivation farms have already planted more than 20 kinds, including Scrophularia ningpoensis, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Rehmannia glutinosa, Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis, Carthamus tinctorius, and tree peony bark, greatly increasing the variety of medicinal materials in Anhui Province. The medicinal material departments have adopted various methods for trial planting and breeding, and have already gained some experience.

In developing the production of Chinese medicinal materials, Anhui Province first strengthened organizational leadership. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, a leading group for medicinal material production was formed, composed of responsible comrades from agriculture, forestry, and health departments, to lead the province's medicinal material production work. The Party committees of counties and people's communes also generally have dedicated personnel responsible for leading medicinal material production, greatly promoting the development of medicinal material production. Most cultivation farms have established medicinal material technology schools or training classes to learn techniques such as collection, cultivation, processing, and storage, combining learning with production. Some places have also adopted the method of inviting veteran herb farmers to take apprentices to improve medicinal materials. During the general survey, more than 150 kinds of medicinal materials were discovered, some of which were made into specimens for teaching and research materials, and some of which were confirmed as medicinal materials after research, enriching the variety of medicinal materials. For example, Lygodium japonicum and Pseudostellaria heterophylla were both discovered not long ago during the survey. Another way to increase the production of Chinese medicinal materials is to increase the yield per unit area. For example, in She County last year, 197 mu of white peony root had a yield of 1,517 jin per mu, an increase of one time compared to the past. In another 1.4 mu plot, the yield was 14,285 jin. Fuyang had a high-yield record of 28,000 jin of Rehmannia glutinosa per mu. In addition to the medicinal material departments engaging in medicinal material production, state-owned farms and schools also carry out medicinal material production in conjunction with greening and beautification.

    变野生野长为家种家养
    安徽建立大批中药培植场
    本报讯　安徽省各级党委重视发展中药材的生产，对各地药材生产部门加强了领导，发动广大群众培植中药材，因而使药材生产获得了迅速发展。安徽省出产中药材极为丰富，有七百多个品种。其中较名贵的产品有霍山的石斛，大别山区的藿香、天麻，歙县、旌德、青阳的鹿茸，滁县、歙县、亳县的菊花，宣城的木瓜和皖南山区的黄连、穿山甲等。产量较大的有白芍、丹皮、茯苓等。
    目前，安徽省药材部门在各县建立了五十个药材培植场，总面积达八万亩以上，有的已先后投入生产。各地依靠人民公社，广泛地培植中药材。有些人民公社成立采集药材专业队，捕捉獐、鹿，采集石斛，有些人民公社还建立了药材培植场或采挖加工厂。
    现在安徽各地把野生改为家种家养的药材有防风、五棓子、麦冬、梅花鹿、半夏、石斛等七十五种；各培植场已下种的有元参、泽泄、生地、佛手、红花、丹皮等二十多种，大大增加了安徽省的药材种类。药材部门采取各种方法进行试种、试养，已经取得了一些经验。
    安徽省在发展中药材生产工作中，首先加强了组织领导。在省委领导下由农业、林业、卫生等部门负责同志组成药材生产领导小组，领导全省药材生产工作；县和人民公社的党委也大都有专人负责领导药材生产，大大地推动了药材生产的发展。大部分培植场内都办起了药材技术学校或训练班，学习采集、培植、加工、保管等技术，使学习与生产相结合。有些地方还采取请老药农带徒弟的方法来提高药材。普查工作中，发现了一百五十多种药材，有的制成标本作为教学研究材料，有的经过研究，肯定为药材，丰富了药材的品种。如海金砂、太子参等都是不久前调查出来的。增加中药材生产的另一种办法就是提高药材的单位面积产量，如歙县去年有一百九十七亩白芍每亩单产一千五百一十七斤，比以往提高一倍；另外一亩四分地单产一万四千二百八十五斤；阜阳出现了生地亩产二万八千斤的高产纪录。安徽除药材部门搞药材生产外，国营农场、学校结合绿化、美化，也进行药材生产。
