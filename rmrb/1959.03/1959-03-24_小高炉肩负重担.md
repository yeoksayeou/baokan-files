Small Blast Furnaces Shoulder Heavy Responsibilities
By Our Correspondent

This year, on the iron and steel industry front in our country, small blast furnaces with certain mechanical equipment, after rectification, consolidation, and improvement, are undertaking about half of this year's pig iron production tasks. The current situation of iron and steel production is: pig iron production still lags behind the needs of steelmaking, while the potential of small blast furnaces is very large. Therefore, whether small blast furnaces can achieve high yields and high quality, and complete and overfulfill production plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, is of great significance to this year's target of 18 million tons of steel.

To improve the output and quality of small blast furnaces, the first priority is to attach importance to them ideologically. Many small blast furnace workers have already created experiences of high yield, high quality, and long life in production practice. Consider the Shuicheng Iron Factory in Guizhou Province, which has a small blast furnace with a volume of 35 cubic meters. Its main production technical indicators are: an average utilization coefficient of 1.689 tons of iron per cubic meter of volume, a sulfur content of 0.07% in pig iron, a coke consumption of 0.8 tons per ton of pig iron, and a cost of 68.83 yuan per ton of iron. These indicators are in no way inferior to large and medium-sized blast furnaces. The Hechuan Iron and Steel Plant in Sichuan Province has a "long-life" small blast furnace that has been in operation since July 1955 for more than three years and eight months and has not yet been shut down for major repairs. Small blast furnaces in the Shijiazhuang area have adopted innovative measures such as multi-nozzle combustion and high-temperature blast, increasing output by nearly double compared to the past. Seriously summarizing, disseminating, and promoting the experience of these advanced small blast furnaces can powerfully promote a large-scale high-yield movement of small blast furnaces, and more high-yield, high-quality, and long-life small blast furnaces can emerge. Although the production conditions of small blast furnaces vary from place to place, and production indicators differ, the pioneers have already blazed a trail, and those behind can and should catch up quickly.

In order to ensure that small blast furnaces across the country can smoothly shoulder this year's production responsibilities, it is also necessary to pay close attention to some of the problems that currently exist in the production of small blast furnaces, and take all measures to solve them practically. First of all, we must do a good job in the preparation and management of various raw materials to ensure that small blast furnaces are well-fed. This is the material foundation for small blast furnaces to achieve high yields and high quality. So-called "well-fed" means that we must do everything possible to improve the grade of iron ore, ensuring that the iron content of the ore entering the furnace is above 40%; we must accelerate the construction of simple coal washing plants, simple coking furnaces, and simple refractory material plants to increase the output and quality of coke and refractory materials, ensuring a steady supply of coke and preventing small blast furnaces from "running out of fuel." Secondly, it is necessary to improve ironmaking technology, strive for a high utilization coefficient, a high pass rate for pig iron, low coke consumption, and low pig iron costs. The "Key Points of Operation and Technical Measures Plan for Small Blast Furnaces" formulated at the recent National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference is the crystallization of ironmaking production experience from various regions and should be conscientiously implemented to reduce the sulfur content of pig iron to the specified limit.

The most fundamental measure to improve the production of small blast furnaces lies in vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously carrying out technological revolution. Explain tasks, targets, and difficult problems to the masses, mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, and rely on the wisdom of the masses to solve problems; we must launch a high-yield, high-quality movement on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, so that production can steadily improve, thereby guaranteeing the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks.

The inspiring drums of war have already sounded on the iron and steel front, and good news of production is pouring in from all directions. Workers of small blast furnaces across the country have issued a solemn initiative, striving to increase the operating rate of small blast furnaces across the country to 80% to 90% in April, striving to gradually reach an average utilization coefficient of one or more for small blast furnaces, and striving to achieve a pig iron pass rate of 95% or more, etc. We wish them success and look forward to hearing good news from them soon.

    小高炉肩负重担
    本报评论员
    今年，在我国钢铁工业战线上，经过整顿、巩固、提高，有一定机械装备的小高炉，担负着今年生铁生产一半左右的任务。当前钢铁生产情况是：生铁生产还赶不上炼钢的需要，而小高炉的潜力很大，因此，小高炉能否高产优质，按日、按旬、按月地完成和超额完成生产计划，对今年的一千八百万吨钢的关系十分重大。
    要提高小高炉的产量和质量，首先要思想上重视小高炉。许多小高炉的职工，已经在生产实践中创造了高产、优质、长寿的经验。请看，贵州省水城铁厂有一座三十五立方公尺容积的小高炉，它的几个主要生产技术指标是：平均利用系数一立方公尺的容积，产铁一点六八九吨，生铁含硫量0.07％，每吨生铁消耗焦炭零点八吨，每吨铁成本六十八点八三元。这些指标比起大、中型高炉来毫无逊色。四川省合川钢铁厂有一座“长寿”小高炉，从1955年7月开炉生产迄今，已逾三年零八个月，还未停炉大修。石家庄地区的小高炉采用多嘴燃烧高温大风的革新措施，产量比过去增加将近一倍。把这些先进小高炉的经验认真加以总结传播、推广，可以有力地推动小高炉大面积丰产运动，可以出现更多高产、优质、长寿的小高炉。虽然各地小高炉生产条件不尽相同，生产指标互有悬殊，但是，先行者既已踏开了一条大路，后面的人就可以而且应该很快赶上来。
    为了保证全国小高炉能顺利地担起今年的生产重担，还必需十分正视当前小高炉生产中存在的一些问题，切切实实地采取一切措施加以解决。首先要作好各种原料的准备和管理工作，保证小高炉吃饱吃好。这是小高炉达到高产、优质的物质基础。所谓吃饱吃好，就是要千方百计地提高铁矿石的品位，务使入炉矿石的含铁量在40％以上；要加快简易洗煤厂、简易炼焦炉和简易耐火材料厂的建设，提高焦炭、耐火材料的产量和质量，保证焦炭源源供应，不使小高炉有“断炊”之虞。其次，要提高炼铁技术，争取利用系数要高，生铁合格率要高，焦炭消耗量要低，生铁成本要低。最近召开的全国小高炉生产技术会议，制订的小高炉操作要点和技术措施方案，是各地炼铁生产经验的结晶，应该认真贯彻执行。使生铁含硫率降低到规定限度。
    提高小高炉生产的最根本的措施，还在于大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命。把任务、指标和困难问题向群众交代，发动群众提合理化建议，依靠群众的智慧来解决问题；必须在充分发动群众的基础上搞高产优质的运动，使生产稳步地提高，以此来保证生产任务的完成和超额完成。
    钢铁战线上振奋人心的战鼓已经响起来了，生产喜讯正从四面八方纷纷传来。全国小高炉工作者们已经发出了庄严的倡议，争取在4月份把全国小高炉的开炉率提高到80％到90％，争取小高炉的平均利用系数逐渐达到一以上，争取生铁合格率达到95％以上等等。我们预祝他们取胜，期待他们早传佳音。
