Plow Hand, Cooperative Chairman, Delegate
    -- An Interview with Korean Female Labor Hero Kim Rak-hui
    By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    Recently, when the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea was in session, I visited Kim Rak-hui, the chairman of the Bonghwa Agricultural Cooperative in Gachon County, and a female labor hero, in Pyongyang. Since the war, she has been a shining example for rural women in Korea.

  The First Female Plow Hand
    She is only twenty-six years old this year. Her rosy face displays the healthy and robust features of a rural woman who has endured wind and rain. Her large eyes shine with a light that fears no difficulties. Eight years ago, Kim Rak-hui began to plow the fields, becoming the first female plow hand, greatly encouraging Korean women to actively participate in labor production to support the front lines.
    It was the spring of 1951, a time when Korea was facing serious difficulties. The young and middle-aged men in the village had all joined the army to fight the enemy on the front lines, and there were no plow hands when it was time for spring plowing. Korean women are very hardworking and are no strangers to activities such as rice planting and weeding, but no one had ever plowed the fields before. Seeing the land about to become barren, everyone was very anxious. At this time, Kim Rak-hui, an eighteen-year-old who had just graduated from junior high school, stepped forward. She first learned plowing from Yoon Soon-sung, an elderly neighbor. The Korean-style wooden plow is very heavy. At first, Kim Rak-hui's back ached after plowing only 500 pyong (approximately 0.41 acres) of land a day, but she persisted in training and learning. Later, she was able to plow 1,000 pyong a day, as much as a man. Under her influence, thousands of women in Junheung-ri and Gachon County took up the plow and cultivated their own fields. That year, not a single pyong of land in Junheung-ri was left barren, and a bumper harvest was obtained. After the autumn harvest, Kim Rak-hui donated more than 1,400 kilograms of rice to the state to support the front lines, and another 1,800 kilograms the following year. From then on, the name of Kim Rak-hui, the first female plow hand and patriotic farmer, resounded throughout the republic.

    A Leader of the Cooperative
    In the winter of 1953, agricultural production cooperatives began to be organized throughout Korea. Kim Rak-hui took the lead in forming the first agricultural cooperative in the area, the Bonghwa Agricultural Cooperative, with seventeen other poor farmers and families of revolutionary soldiers, mainly with women as the labor force. Although Kim Rak-hui was only a twenty-year-old girl, her high degree of patriotism, collective spirit, and outstanding labor gave her great prestige, and people elected her as the chairman of the agricultural cooperative. Kim Rak-hui would leave before dawn every day with a rice ball in her pocket, leading the girls and daughters-in-law to work in the fields. That year, the cooperative's grain output was one and a half times higher than when they were working individually the previous year, and households within the cooperative that had previously lacked grain no longer did. In this way, in less than two years, more than 170 farmers in Junheung-ri had all joined the cooperative.

    A Strong General Has No Weak Soldiers
    Under Kim Rak-hui's influence and leadership, the women of the Bonghwa Agricultural Cooperative were all skilled laborers. Song Ok-shin, a family member of a revolutionary martyr, was the champion female worker in the Bonghwa Cooperative, having worked 380 workdays last year. Although she raises three children, she has not needed government assistance for several years and lives a good life.
    Last year, the Bonghwa Cooperative merged with three other small cooperatives into a large cooperative with 600 households. They established seven canteens, as well as nurseries and kindergartens, liberating women from household chores. Under the leadership of Kim Rak-hui, all members of the Bonghwa Cooperative are in high spirits. They are working hard to build a new socialist countryside.

    扶犁手、社长、议员
    ——访朝鲜女劳动英雄金乐姬
    本报记者　王玉章
    最近朝鲜最高人民会议举行会议的时候，我在平壤访问了朝鲜价川郡烽火农业社社长、女劳动英雄金乐姬，从战争时期起她一直是朝鲜农村妇女的一面光辉的旗帜。
  第一个女扶犁手
    她今年还只有二十六岁，红通通的面孔显示出饱受过风吹雨打的农村妇女的健美的丰采，一对大大的眼睛闪着不怕一切困难的光芒。八年前，金乐姬开始扶犁耕地，成为第一个女扶犁手，对朝鲜妇女努力参加劳动生产支援前线起了巨大的鼓舞作用。
    那是1951年春天，正是朝鲜处在严重的困难中的时候，村子里的青壮男子都参军到前线去杀敌人去了，到了应该春耕的时候没有扶犁手。朝鲜的妇女是很勤劳的，她们对于插秧薅草这些活并不生疏，但扶犁耕地还没有人干过。眼看着土地要荒芜，大家都很着急。这时刚从初中毕业的十八岁的金乐姬挺身而出，她首先向邻家的老人尹顺成学习耕地。朝鲜式的木犁很重，金乐姬开始一天耕五百坪地就腰酸背疼，但她坚持着进行锻炼、学习，后来她竟能够一天耕一千坪，同男子耕的一样多。在她的影响下俊赫里和价川郡的数千名妇女都操起了犁把，自己耕田。这一年俊赫里一坪地也没有荒，并获得了丰收。秋收后金乐姬献给国家一千四百多公斤稻谷支援前线，第二年又献了一千八百多公斤。从此，第一个女扶犁手、爱国农民金乐姬的名字就响遍了共和国。
    合作社的带头人
    1953年冬天，朝鲜各地开始组织农业生产合作社。金乐姬首先带头同另外十七户贫农、烈军属以妇女为主要劳动力组成了这一带的第一个农业社——烽火农业社。金乐姬虽然不过是一个二十岁的姑娘，但她的高度的爱国精神，集体精神和她的出色的劳动，使她有很高的威信，人们就选她当农业社的社长。金乐姬每天天刚亮她就揣起一个饭团子领着姑娘媳妇们到田里劳动。这一年社里的粮食产量就等于前一年单干时的一倍半，社内的缺粮户都不缺粮了。就这样不到两年的时间，俊赫里的一百七十多户农民就全部入了社。
    强将手下无弱兵
    在金乐姬的影响和领导下，烽火农业社的妇女们个个都是劳动能手。烈属宋玉新在劳动中是烽火社的女状元，她去年一人作了三百八 十个劳动日。她虽然抚养着三个小孩，但她几年来已不需要政府的照顾，生活过得很好。
    去年烽火社同另外三个小社并成了一个六百户的大社，办了七个食堂，还办起了托儿所、幼儿园，妇女都从家务劳动中解放出来了。金乐姬领导下的烽火社个个社员情绪高涨，他们正在积极劳动，建设社会主义的新农村。
