Mastering Basic Courses is Essential to Reaching Technological Heights
Harbin Institute of Technology Takes Various Measures to Strengthen Basic Course Teaching
(Our newspaper, Harbin, 15th dispatch) Harbin Institute of Technology is taking active measures to strengthen basic courses, so that the teaching of basic courses is better integrated with professional studies and linked to production practice, thereby continuously improving students' level of basic theoretical knowledge.

In dealing with the issue of basic courses, there were previously two deviations. One was that basic courses were completely divorced from production practice, so that students could not fully apply the knowledge of basic courses when studying their major and engaging in production practice. The other was to ignore the role of basic courses and advocate merging them into professional courses. After implementing the Party's policy of "combining education with productive labor," and after a year of practice, it has been proven that both of these deviations are incorrect. Many students have realized from production practice that the problems posed by real life far exceed the scope of professional knowledge, and that it is necessary to systematically study basic courses in order to adapt to the needs of practical work. Moreover, various professional knowledge is actually a special application and development of the common laws taught in basic courses. Only by mastering basic courses can one independently study and understand things by analogy. They used many facts from participating in production labor and scientific research activities to powerfully refute those who wanted to abolish or disintegrate basic courses and incorporate them into professional courses, believing that this would destroy the internal connections between courses and make basic courses develop solely in the direction of "practicality," thereby reducing the quality of talent cultivation. On the other hand, after the implementation of the Party's education policy, basic course teachers participated in the production labor of relevant majors and gained practical experience, which made it possible to combine the teaching of basic courses with professional studies and link it to practice.

It is on this basis that Harbin Institute of Technology has taken various measures to strengthen the teaching of basic courses. After the summer vacation last year, the school established two basic theory departments, namely mathematics, physics, mechanics, and chemical engineering, which provided conditions for cultivating basic course teachers and improving the quality of basic course teaching. This semester, it is more clearly stipulated that each department and major should be responsible for the quality of basic course teaching within its own scope; each department should have a department head or teaching secretary responsible for the basic course teaching of the department; and assist basic course teachers in solving problems such as the combination of teaching and majors.

Now, the teaching and research sections of basic courses such as mathematics, physics, and theoretical mechanics are preparing to fix teachers to teach a certain department as much as possible, and through organizing visits to laboratories of relevant majors, reading curriculum design materials, and participating in professional labor, the basic course teachers can understand the role played by the basic course they teach in the process of training students in this major.

Various departments and majors have also taken many methods to actively help basic course teachers understand the requirements of their departments and majors. For example, the Power Machinery Department established a three-in-one group of basic course teachers, professional course teachers, and students, to jointly study and improve the teaching content and teaching methods of basic courses according to professional requirements; the Electrical Engineering Department organized teachers of various basic courses to study the interrelated teaching content problems. For example, the content of "semiconductors" is taught in four courses: chemistry, physics, industrial electronics, and electrical engineering materials. In the past, teachers of each course did not communicate with each other, and the teaching content was repeated; now, they jointly study and assign teaching tasks according to their respective focuses.

Basic course teachers cooperating with professional studies to conduct scientific research work is one of the important measures taken by the Industrial University to strengthen basic courses, and make them combine with professional studies and connect with reality. In the scientific research of the giant turbine for the Three Gorges water conservancy project conducted by the hydraulic machinery major, the "vibration" problem is a key issue, and the strength calculation problem is also very complicated when designing the rotor of the turbine, which once made the hydraulic machinery teaching and research section feel very tricky, but after the material mechanics basic course teachers participated in the scientific research work of this major, these problems were solved smoothly, and promoted the related scientific research work. At the same time, basic course teachers have also enriched the content of their lectures and improved the quality of teaching because of participating in scientific research work.

In addition, the Industrial University also revises the teaching syllabus of basic courses according to professional requirements. At present, some departments have selected some majors, and in accordance with the principle of combining teaching, production, and scientific research, with teaching as the main focus, organized basic course teachers, professional course teachers, and students to jointly discuss and formulate a teaching plan that can correctly reflect this principle.

Since the beginning of this semester, the teaching and research sections of various basic courses are comprehensively carrying out the teaching reform work of basic courses in accordance with the spirit of "combining with majors, connecting with reality, and reflecting the latest technological achievements", and carefully preparing lessons. Some experienced teachers also take the initiative to help new teachers start courses in order to improve the quality of basic course teaching.

    学好基础课才能攀上技术高峰
    哈尔滨工大采取多种措施加强基础课教学
    本报哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨工业大学正采取积极措施加强基础课，使基础课的教学更好地结合专业，联系生产实际，从而不断地提高学生的基础理论知识水平。
    在对待基础课的问题上，过去曾发生过两种偏向，一种是基础课完全脱离生产实际，使学生在学习专业和进行生产实践时不能充分运用基础课的知识。一种是忽视基础课的作用，主张归并到专业课中去。在贯彻党的“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针后，经过一年的实践，证明这两种偏向都是不对的。很多同学从生产实践中体会到：现实生活提出的问题远远超过了专业知识的范围，必须系统的学习基础课，以适应实际工作的需要。而且各种专业知识实际上多是基础课中讲过的共同规律的特殊运用和发展，只有学好基础课，才能独立钻研，触类旁通。他们用参加生产劳动及科学研究活动中的很多事实有力地批驳了那些要把基础课取消或解体并入专业课的主张，认为这样会破坏各门课程间的内在联系，使基础课单纯向“实用”方面发展，因而会降低培养人才的质量。另一方面，基础课的教师从党的教育方针贯彻后，参加各有关专业的生产劳动，有了实践的体会，也使讲授基础课时结合专业，联系实际有了可能。
    哈尔滨工业大学就在这样的基础上，采取多种措施来加强基础课程的教学。去年暑期以后，学校建立了数理力学和化学工程两个基础理论系，为培养基础课师资及提高基础课教学质量提供了条件。这学期更明确规定：各系各专业要对本单位范围内的基础课教学质量负责；各系有一名系主任或教学秘书负责本系的基础课教学；并协助基础课教师解决教学与专业相结合等问题。
    现在，数学、物理、理论力学等基础课教研室预备尽可能地让教师固定教某一个系，并通过组织参观有关专业的实验室、阅看课程设计资料及参加专业劳动等方式，使基础课教师能了解自己所讲授的这门基础课在培养这个专业学生的过程中所起的作用。
    各个系和专业也采取许多方法主动帮助基础课教师来了解本系本专业的要求。如动力机械系成立了基础课教师、专业课教师和学生三结合小组，根据专业要求共同研究改进基础课教学内容和教学法；电机系把各门基础课教师组织起来，研究互相有关联的教学内容问题。如“半导体”这部分内容，在化学、物理、工业电子学、电工材料四门课中都讲，以前各课教师互不通气，讲授内容重复；现在则共同研究，各按重点，分工讲授。
    基础课教师与专业合作搞科学研究工作是工业大学采取的加强基础课、并使之结合专业、联系实际的重要措施之一。水力机械专业所进行的三峡水利枢纽工程用的巨型水轮机的科学研究中，“振动”问题是一个关键，在设计水轮机的转子时，强度计算问题也很复杂，这些都曾使水力机械教研室感到很棘手，而材料力学基础课教师参加这个专业的科学研究工作后，就使这些难题顺利地得到了解决，推进了有关系的科学研究工作。同时，基础课教师也因为参加科学研究工作，充实了讲课内容，提高了教学质量。
    另外，工业大学还根据专业要求修订基础课的教学大纲。目前，有的系已选择一些专业，按照教学、生产、科学研究三结合，以教学为主的原则，组织基础课教师、专业课教师和学生共同讨论制定能正确反映这一原则的教学计划。
    这学期开学以来，各基础课教研室都正在根据“结合专业，联系实际，反映最新技术成就”的精神，全面地进行基础课的教学改革工作，认真地进行备课，一些有经验的教师还主动帮助新教师开课，以提高基础课的教学质量。
