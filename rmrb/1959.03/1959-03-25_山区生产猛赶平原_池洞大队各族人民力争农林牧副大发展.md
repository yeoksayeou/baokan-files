　　Nanning, March 24th (reported by this newspaper) – The Chidong Brigade of the Sanfang Commune in the Damiao Mountain Miao Autonomous County of Guangxi, displaying the spirit of self-reliance, further taps its potential and is determined to work hard for a year to strive to change the face of the mountainous area and catch up with the economic level of the plains areas.

　　The Chidong Brigade is located in a high and cold mountainous area where Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Han people live together. The brigade has more than 100 households and more than 500 people. In recent years, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have gradually improved, but their grain and sideline income still cannot catch up with the wealthier communities. The people’s commune has brought conditions for leap-forward development to this brigade. This brigade was merged from the original two ethnic joint advanced cooperatives. The original Han and Zhuang joint cooperative accounted for 70% of the land and 40% of the labor force; the Miao and Yao joint cooperative accounted for 30% of the land and 60% of the labor force. After the brigade was merged, the land and labor force were fully and rationally utilized. The original Miao and Yao joint cooperative had a large number of economic forests, but lacked management technology. After communization, under the guidance of Han members, the development of forestry and sideline industries such as tea planting, beekeeping, and the production of shiitake mushrooms was generally developed. With the help of Han members of the Luodong Brigade, the brigade learned production techniques such as planting rice, corn, and wheat, and developed production. In this way, the Chidong Brigade achieved several times the increase in production in 1958: the average rice yield per mu reached more than 1,600 jin, an increase of more than eight times compared with 1957, the average yield per mu of dry land crops reached 654 jin, an increase of more than five times compared with 1957, and the income from various sideline industries was 120,000 yuan. More than 80,000 jin of surplus grain was sold, turning from a grain-deficient brigade into a surplus grain brigade.

　　After communization, under the unified leadership of the commune, mutual support and common development among all ethnic groups have created extremely favorable conditions for the further development of production in the Chidong Brigade. After implementing the principles of "unified leadership, decentralized management" and "distribution according to work, more pay for more work" in the people's commune, the brigade showed more initiative, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, and was determined to work hard for a year to catch up with the advanced plains areas and fundamentally change the face of the mountainous area. Under the leadership of the Party branch, everyone believed that the mountainous area had many favorable conditions and great potential. For example, further transforming cold water fields and improving farming methods, strengthening the prevention of animal damage, and grain output could be greatly increased; many fallow lands could be reclaimed for farming; abundant pasture could be used to develop animal husbandry; a large number of wild tea forests and shiitake mushrooms could be greatly increased in yield with reclamation and management, and so on. As a result, the seven production teams revised this year's leap forward plan, implemented the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production based on the characteristics of the mountainous area. The original plan was to plant 20 mu of early rice, which was expanded to 170 mu, and the yield per mu was increased from 2,500 jin to 4,500 jin; the original planting of 1,000 mu of dry food crops has now been expanded to 3,000 mu, and the yield per mu has been increased from 800 jin to 1,200 jin. After the implementation of this plan, the average per capita grain yield this year will reach more than 2,300 jin. Vigorously develop forestry and sideline production, raise a large number of pigs, chickens, and bees, cultivate 1,000 mu of tea, 100 mu of palm bark, and 50 mu of medicinal materials, arrange 2,000 workdays for mushroom cutting. In this way, the average per capita income from forestry and sideline industries this year can reach more than 100 yuan, and it can reach 430 yuan next year.

　　Now, all members of the team are engaged in intense fighting to realize this plan. The entire team has built 64 new field sheds, and all people, cattle, farm implements, and canteens are on the mountain, carrying out spring ploughing production in full swing. As of the 20th, all the paddy fields in the team have been harrowed, and 1,200 dan of fertilizer have been applied per mu, 200 mu of land have been opened up, and 140,000 jin of lime have been burned. Sideline production is also developing greatly, with more than 10,000 jin of shiitake mushrooms, more than 1,000 jin of honey, and more than 100 tigers and bears captured. (Attached picture)

    山区生产猛赶平原
    池洞大队各族人民力争农林牧副大发展
    本报南宁24日电　广西大苗山苗族自治县三防公社池洞大队，发扬自力更生的精神，进一步挖掘潜力，决心大干一年，力争改变山区面貌，赶上平原地区的经济水平。
    池洞大队位于苗、瑶、僮、汉各族人民杂居的高寒山区，全队有一百多户，五百多人。这里山高岭峻，地多田少。近几年来，各族人民生活逐步得到改善，但粮食和副业收入还赶不上富裕社。人民公社化给这个大队带来了飞跃发展的条件。这个大队是由原来的两个民族联合高级社合并而成的。原来的汉、僮族联合社，土地占70％，劳力占40％；苗、瑶族联合社土地占30％，劳力占60％；合并大队后，土地、劳力都得到了充分合理的使用。原来的苗、瑶族联合社有大量的经济林木，但缺乏经营技术，公社化以后，在汉族社员指导下，普遍发展了种茶、养蜂、生产香菌等林、副业。在罗洞大队汉族社员帮助下，这个大队学会了种植水稻、玉米、小麦等生产技术，发展了生产。这样，池洞大队1958年在生产上获得了数倍的增长：水稻亩产平均达一千六百多斤，比1957年增长八倍以上，旱地作物平均亩产达六百五十四斤，比1957年增长五倍以上，各项副业收入十二万元，卖余粮八万多斤，由缺粮变为余粮大队。
    公社化以后，在公社统一领导下，各民族相互支援，共同发展，给池洞大队进一步发展生产创造了极其有利的条件。在贯彻执行人民公社“统一领导、分级管理”、“按劳分配、多劳多得”的原则后，这个大队表现得更积极主动，发扬了自力更生的精神，决心大干一年，赶上先进的平原地区，从根本上改变山区的面貌。在党支部的领导下，大家认为山区的有利条件很多，潜力很大。如进一步改造冷水田和改善耕种方法，加强防止兽害，粮食产量还可大大提高；许多轮休生地可供开垦种田；丰富的牧草可供发展畜牧业；大量的野生茶林和香菌等只要加以开垦管护，产量很大，等等。于是，七个生产小队纷纷修订今年的跃进规划，根据山区特点，实行农林牧副全线大发展。原计划种早稻二十亩，扩大为一百七十亩，亩产由二千五百斤提高到四千五百斤；旱粮作物原种一千亩，现已扩大为三千亩，亩产由八百斤提高到一千二百斤。这个规划实现后，今年平均每人有粮将达二千三百多斤。大力发展林、副业生产，大量养猪、养鸡、养蜂，垦种茶叶一千亩，棕皮一百亩、药材五十亩，安排砍菌二千个工，这样，今年的林副业收入平均每人可得一百多元，明年即可达到四百三十元。
    现在，全队社员为实现这个规划，正进行紧张战斗。全队新建田头工棚六十四间，人、耕牛、农具、食堂全上山，紧张地进行春耕生产。到20日止，全队水田已全耙完，每亩下肥一千二百担，开地二百亩，烧石灰十四万斤。副业生产也在大发展，已采集香菌一万多斤，蜂糖一千多斤，捕捉虎、熊等一百多只。（附图片）
