    A Good Book Needs Skillful Presentation
    Qin Li
    Sometimes, getting a book means knowing the title beforehand and going to the bookstore specifically to buy it; other times, it's because you accidentally discover a book with a unique binding among thousands of books, and then, after examining the contents, you buy it.

    When you buy a book with wonderful content but the binding is crude and vulgar, you always feel a bit unpleasant while reading. Sometimes, you come across a book that you didn't initially plan to read immediately, but you are attracted by its exquisite binding. You feel that the book's appearance and content are combined into a complete work of art, which increases your interest in reading, and you can't help but read it first.

    Recently, I bought a newly published small book called "Accuse Fascism" in a bookstore. The binding is simple and exquisite. The cover has a sketch of Dimitrov, a depiction of him speaking at the Leipzig trial. The picture isn't complex, and the background color of the book is snow-white, using only two colors, but it stands out among a pile of red and green books.

    Are the bindings of current publications all as elaborate and serious as this little book? Readers still have some regrets in this regard. Some books are too fragile. Some hardcover books start to have their covers warped not long after you buy them; or the "skin" and "flesh" separate. What about paperback books? Some can't be opened flat on the table; some have covers that are too ugly; some have text that is too dense, with too little space at the top and bottom, making it very difficult to read!

    Of course, advocating for attention to the art of bookbinding does not necessarily mean requiring every book to have a silk cover with gold lettering, luxurious and opulent, or to have colors that are as complex as possible. In fact, that would increase the burden on readers. What we advocate is that, within the limits of material conditions, we should maximize the creativity of binding personnel, making them both inexpensive and very exquisite, lovely, sturdy, and durable. This is easy to do. Isn't "Accuse Fascism" an example?

    By the way, Mr. Lu Xun paid the most attention to the art of bookbinding. He not only personally bound his own books, but also designed the covers of many books and magazines for others. He personally designed the book's layout and the fonts used, and he never relaxed. In this regard, it is also very necessary to learn from Mr. Lu Xun's meticulous spirit. (Attached picture)

    好书还得巧打扮
    秦犁
    得到一本书，有时是先知道了书名特地到书店买来的；有的时候，却又因为在万书丛中无意间发现了一本装帧别致的书，然后翻检内容后购来的。
    买到一册内容很精彩的书，但那装帧却粗俗不堪，读书时总有点不愉快的感觉。有时遇到一本原来没想马上要读的书，却为它那精致的装帧吸引，觉得书的外型与内容结合起来简直就是一个完整的艺术品，结果就增加了阅读的兴趣，立即爱不释手地先读了它。
    最近我在书店买到一本新出版的小书“控诉法西斯”，装帧朴素而精致，封面有一幅季米特洛夫的素描像，是他在莱比锡法庭上讲话的写照，画面并不庞杂，书的底色是雪白的，也只用了两种颜色，但在一堆大红大绿的书中却显得十分不寻常。
    现在的出版物的装帧是不是都像这本小书一样地讲究、认真呢？这方面，读者还是颇有遗憾的。有的书太不结实。有的精装书买不多久，封皮就翘起来了；要不“皮”与“肉”就分了家。平装书呢？有的摊在桌上摊不开、放不平；有的书封面太难看；有的字太密，上下天地留得太小，看时十分吃力！
    当然，提倡讲究书籍装帧艺术，并非一定要求每本书都绸面烫金、豪华富丽，或是要套印得颜色越复杂才越好，其实那样反会增加了读者的负担。我们提倡的是，在物质条件可能的情况下，要尽量发挥装帧人员的创造性，既要花钱少，又要十分精致可爱、结实耐看。这一点是容易做到的。“控诉法西斯”不就是一个例子吗？
    顺便说一声，鲁迅先生是最讲究书籍装帧艺术的，他不仅亲自装帧自己的著书，也还代人装帧设计许多书刊杂志的封面，对于书的排版格式，以及所用字号等等，也都亲自设计毫不放松，在这一点上，学习鲁迅先生的一丝不苟的精神也是很必要的。（附图片）
