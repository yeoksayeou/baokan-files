“Work is only afraid of experts”
	Dong Rongshen

There is an old Russian saying: “Work is only afraid of experts; fake experts are afraid of work.” I think the meaning is very profound. To run the cause of the working class in a vibrant and successful way, we must transform ourselves into real “experts,” not “fake” ones. Without revolutionary will, lacking revolutionary passion and perseverance, one will of course be intimidated by difficult and arduous work; but merely having will, passion, and perseverance without “expert” knowledge will not get things done well. Lenin said: “The working people must master science.” This is precisely because work is only afraid of experts. Once experts do the work, things will be done better with less time and effort.

What does it mean to be an expert? It means someone who has skillfully grasped the laws and rules of that line of work. To become an expert, one must arm one's mind with knowledge. And so-called knowledge is not narrowly defined. Gorky has an article called "On 'Small' People and Their Great Work," which says: "It is difficult to know everything our vast and resource-rich country has done in the past and present, and how it has been done. But all literate workers and peasants must know these things, each of them must know them, and they must pass on this knowledge of creation to illiterate workers and peasants."

Acquiring knowledge is a difficult process. As the old saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." This is of course a metaphor, but it summarizes a truth: it takes time! Of course, under the new system where no one oppresses anyone, the speed can be greater. But in the process of acquiring knowledge, there is a very dangerous enemy, which is the tendency to be self-satisfied. As the old saying goes, "Only after learning do you know your inadequacy." All those who study diligently and delve into knowledge know that their knowledge is but a drop in the ocean. The opposite of this saying is: "If you don't learn, you will be content!" Throughout history, the more "expert" someone is, the more humble they are. The so-called "great wisdom appears foolish" is, in my opinion, not about being stupid, but rather those "experts" "know their inadequacy," so they are "not ashamed to ask those 'below'," learning from others at all times and in all places, looking just like the "foolish" old man.

A sense of pride is necessary, especially for us, because our nation has lived under the oppression of foreign capital and domestic exploiters for many years, and sometimes we inevitably have a bit of inferiority complex. But pride is not equal to arrogance. If pride is excessively developed into arrogance, it is very detrimental to seeking knowledge. Gorky told a very interesting example. It is said that an arrogant person went to Europe to travel. People asked him, "Do you like the sea?" He replied, "We have plenty of sea ourselves!" Gorky strongly disagreed with this. As I see it, having our own sea is a sense of pride, but "being proud of our own sea and looking down on other countries' seas" (Gorky) is a bit too much. In the past, some people said, "Even the moon is better in foreign countries!" This is fawning on foreigners and is a lack of ambition; it is national inferiority. But "we have plenty of sea ourselves!" also prevents us from humbly looking at other countries' seas, not to mention the lack of respect for other countries' seas. If the sea is like this, how can everything else be any different!

Therefore, acquiring knowledge and participating in labor are two indispensable aspects of transforming from an amateur to an expert. As for fake experts, that is of course much simpler. You only need to put on some nice colors on your face, but when they encounter practical work, they can only stare blankly, at a loss; otherwise, they pretend to be experts, mess around, and ruin good things.

    “工作只怕行家做”
    栋榕森
    俄罗斯有句古语：“工作只怕行家做，冒牌行家怕工作。”我觉得含义确实十分深刻。要把工人阶级的事业办得有声有色，必须把自己变成真正的“行家”，而不是“冒牌”的“行家”。没有革命的意志，缺少革命的热情和毅力，当然会在困难艰苦的工作面前被吓倒的；可是仅仅有意志、热情和毅力，而没有“内行”的见识，事情是办不好的。列宁说：“劳动人民应当精通科学。”为的就是工作只怕行家做，行家一做，事情就会用较少的时间花较少的力气办得较好。
    行家——这是什么意思呢？就是熟练地掌握了这一行工作的规律、规则的人。要成为行家，就必须用知识将自己的头脑武装起来。而所谓知识，又不是狭义的。高尔基有一篇文章叫做“论‘渺小的’人及其伟大的工作”，这里面说：“要想知道我们这个地大物博的国家过去和现在所做的一切，知道这一切是怎样做的，那是困难的。但是必须使所有识字的工农知道这些，必须让他们每一个人都知道这些，并且要他们把自己这种关于创造的知识传授给不识字的工农。”
    要获得知识，那是一个艰苦的过程。古语说：“十年树木，百年树人”，这当然是比喻，这比喻总结了一条真理：要花时间！当然，在没有人压迫人的新制度下，速度是可以更大的。可是在获得知识的过程中，有一个十分危险的敌人，那就是容易自己满足。古语云：“学而后知不足。”凡是刻苦用功，钻研知识的人，才知道自己的知识是沧海之一粟。这句古语的反面是：“不学则知足”了！古往今来，越是“行家”，越是虚心，所谓“大智若愚”者，我看这“愚”实非蠢材之谓，不过是那些“行家”“知不足”，于是“不耻‘下’问”，随时随地向人学习，看上去活像“愚”公而已。
    自豪感是要的，在我们尤其必要，因为我们这个民族多少年来曾经在外国资本和本国剥削者压迫下面生活，有时不免多了些自卑感。但是自豪不等于自傲。如果把自豪过分地发展到傲慢，对于寻求知识是很不利的。高尔基讲过一个很有趣的例子。据说有个傲慢的人去欧洲游历。人家问他：“你喜欢海吗？”他就回答说：“我们自己有的是海！”高尔基对此大不以为然。据我想，自己有海——这是自豪感，但是“以本国海自豪，看不起别国的海”（高尔基），那就有点过分了。从前有人说：“月亮也是外国的好！”这是媚外，没有出息，民族自卑主义者。但是“我们自己有的是海！”也就妨碍着虚心看看别国的海，还不必说对别国的海不够尊重了。海如此，其他一切又何尝不是如此！
    所以说，获取知识和参加劳动——这是由外行变为行家不可缺少的两个方面。至于冒牌行家，那当然简单得多，只须在脸上搽上好看的颜色就行了，不过他碰到实际工作，只好瞠目结舌，束手无策；要不然就冒充内行，乱来一气，把好事办坏了。
