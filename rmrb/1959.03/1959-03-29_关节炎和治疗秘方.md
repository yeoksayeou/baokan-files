    Arthritis and Treatment Secret Recipes
    Editor's Note: After the publication of Comrade Mu Lin's "Spring Night Jottings" in the supplement on March 10th, we received over a hundred letters from readers inquiring about the prescription mentioned in the article for treating arthritis. We have now received a reply from Comrade Mu Lin. Based on Comrade Mu Lin's introduction, we have copied the prescription published in the "Chinese Journal of Intermediate Medicine" below. In addition, we have invited Dr. Cai Jingfeng of the Beijing Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine to provide a more detailed analysis of the treatment of arthritis with traditional Chinese medicine, which is also published below for readers' reference.
    Comrade Mu Lin's Letter
    To the Editor:
    After my "Spring Night Jottings" was published on page eight, many comrades wrote to me asking for the arthritis prescription mentioned in the article. This made me realize that I lacked a mass perspective when writing that article. Although the theme of the article was not to introduce the prescription, my unclear explanation caused anxiety to those suffering from the same illness, which made me feel very uneasy.
    The prescription I saw was published on page 33 of the first issue of the "Chinese Journal of Intermediate Medicine" published by the People's Medical Publishing House in 1959. It was disclosed by Qi Yuzhai, a physician from Changfeng Township, Renqiu County, Hebei Province. To avoid errors caused by transcription, proofreading, and transmission, which could affect health and safety, I hope that comrades who need this prescription will consult a doctor and obtain their consent before prescribing and trying it.
    After taking three doses, my condition has greatly improved. I am truly grateful to Dr. Qi and the comrades from the Shandong Dazhong Daily and Jinan Hongjitang who helped me prepare the prescription.

    My Views on the Treatment of Arthritis with Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Dr. Cai Jingfeng, Beijing Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    The main cause of rheumatic arthritis is not "wind" and "dampness." Damp housing may be an inducing factor for arthritis, but the main cause is related to a type of hemolytic streptococcus. The blood of rheumatic arthritis patients contains antibodies that resist hemolytic streptococcus, but this bacterium cannot be found, so it is likely an allergic reaction to this bacterium. Soviet scientists further point out that this is a disease related to nervous system dysfunction. In addition, fatigue, nutrition, and chronic infections such as tonsillitis may also cause this disease. In other words, the cause of arthritis is the sum of several complex factors.
    The "arthritis" we usually talk about often includes two types of diseases. One is "rheumatic," which often involves pain in some large joints, with the pain moving around. Today, the knee hurts, tomorrow it may be the wrist joint, and after a few days, it may be completely painless, without leaving any problems on the joint. The other type of arthritis often involves pain in the finger joints, and it occurs symmetrically in both hands. Over time, the joints may become deformed, large in the middle and small at both ends. This is called "rheumatoid arthritis."
    Traditional Chinese medicine collectively calls "rheumatic" and "rheumatoid" arthritis "Bi" syndrome, also known as "Li Jie" disease. It believes that this disease is the result of the combined influence of "wind, cold, and dampness." If "wind" is the dominant factor, the joint pain has no fixed location, which is called "Xing Bi," somewhat similar to "rheumatic arthritis." If "dampness" is severe, the pain is fixed in a certain joint, which is called "Zhuo Bi," somewhat similar to "rheumatoid arthritis." As for the pain felt by the patient, it is caused by "cold." Cold causes Qi stagnation and blood coagulation. If Qi and blood do not circulate, of course there will be pain.
    Modern medicine has many treatments for arthritis. Salicylic acid preparations such as "aspirin" are very effective for "rheumatic" arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can also be treated with medication and physiotherapy. Traditional Chinese medicine treats "Bi" syndrome, whether it is "rheumatoid" or "rheumatic," by targeting the three Qi of "wind, cold, and dampness," using methods to dispel wind, promote dampness, and dispel cold to eliminate the cause of the disease. Because Qi stagnates and blood coagulates, and the meridians are blocked, drugs that activate blood circulation and unblock the meridians should be used. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine has the treatment principle of "treating blood first when treating wind, and wind will disappear when blood flows," so blood-activating drugs are the most commonly used for treating this disease.
    Dr. Qi Yuzhai's prescription for treating rheumatic arthritis contains several blood-activating drugs, such as peach kernel, Angelica sinensis, chuanxiong, red peony, and safflower. Cinnamon twig and Erodium stephanianum are used to unblock the meridians. Ledebouriella seseloides, papaya, saposhnikovia, aconite, and chuanxiong are used to dispel wind, cold, and dampness. Therefore, this prescription is in line with the principles of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Because each patient's condition and specific circumstances such as physical condition and living environment are different, the treatment methods, types of drugs, and dosages are not completely the same for the same disease. Therefore, it is recommended that patients who want to use this prescription consult a doctor for diagnosis and take the medicine according to the doctor's advice.

    关节炎和治疗秘方
    编者按：副刊在3月10日发表了木林同志写的“春夜随笔”后，我们收到一百多位读者来信，询问这篇文章中所提到的治疗关节炎的药方是什么。现在我们已经木林同志作了答复。根据木林同志的介绍，将“中级医刊”上登载的这个药方抄录于下。此外，我们还约请了北京市中医研究院蔡景峰医师就中药治疗关节炎的问题作了比较详细的分析，一并发表于下，供读者参考。
    木林同志来信编辑同志：
    我写的“春夜随笔”在第八版上发表后，不少同志写信向我要文中提到的那个治关节炎的药方，这就使我觉察到我在写那篇文章的时候，缺乏群众观点。虽然那篇文章的主题不是介绍方子，但是，由于我交代不清，而使同病者着急，使我感到很不安。
    我看到的那个方子刊登在人民卫生出版社出版的“中级医刊”1959年第一期三十三页。是河北任丘县长丰乡医师齐玉斋公开的。为了避免转抄、校对、传递造成谬误，影响健康、安全，希望需要这个方子的同志，在征求医师同意后，再去配药试服。
    连服三剂，我的病情已大为减轻。真得谢谢齐医师和帮助我配齐药方的山东大众日报与济南宏济堂的同志们。

    我对中药治疗关节炎的看法
    北京中医研究院医师　蔡景峰
    风湿性关节炎的主要原因并不是“风”与“湿”，住所潮湿可能是引起关节炎的诱因，而主要原因却与一种溶血性链球菌有关系。在风湿性关节炎患者的血液中有抵抗溶血性链球菌的抗体，但却找不到这种细菌，因而很可能是对这种病菌的一种过敏表现。苏联科学家更指出这是与神经系统功能失常有关的一种病。此外，劳累、营养、慢性感染如扁桃腺炎……等也可能引起这种病的发生。换句话说，关节炎的病因是若干复杂因素的总和。
    我们平时所说的“关节炎”，其中常包括两种病，一种是“风湿性”的，常常是一些大关节疼痛，痛的部位游走不定，今天腿膝盖痛，明天可能是手腕关节痛，几天后也可能完全不痛了，而关节上也不留下什么毛病；另一种关节炎常常是手指头关节痛，而且两手对称性地发病，日子长了，关节就可能变形，中间大，两头小，这叫“风湿样关节炎”。
    祖国医学把“风湿性”和“风湿样”的关节炎，统统叫作“痹”症，也叫“历节”病。认为这种病是“风寒湿”三气杂至的影响。三气中如果“风”是主重的，关节痛就没固定部位，名之为“行痹”，有点类似“风湿性关节炎”；如果“湿”厉害，痛的部位便固定在某一关节上，名之为“著痹”，有点类似“风湿样”的关节炎。至于患者感到疼痛，是“寒”在作祟，寒使气滞血凝，气血不通，当然要痛。
    现代医学对关节炎的治疗方法并不少，柳酸制剂如“阿斯匹林”，对“风湿性”关节炎有很大的疗效。风湿样的关节炎，也可以用药和理疗……等等办法。中医治疗“痹”症，不管是“风湿样”也罢，“风湿性”也好，都针对“风寒湿”三气，用散风利湿祛寒的方法，除去病因。由于气滞血凝，经络不通，就要用活血、通经络的药，同时中医有“治风先治血、血行风自灭”的治疗原则，因此，活血药是治这种病最常用的。
    齐玉斋医师治疗风湿性关节炎的这个药方，其中桃仁、当归、川芎、赤芍、红花等几味药是活血的；桂枝、老鹳草等是通经络的；羌活、木瓜、防风、附子、川芎……等是祛风寒湿的，因此，这个方子是符合中医的治疗原则的。
    由于每一个患者的病情和身体、生活环境等具体情况不同，往往对同一种病人的治疗方法和用药种类、份量多少等都不完全一样，因此建议欲采用这个方子的病人，最好请医生诊断后，按照医生的意见服用。
