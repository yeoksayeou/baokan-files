Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Shantou, Guangdong Province, experimental kelp farming in coastal counties of the special district is currently growing well. It is estimated that by April, each mu can harvest approximately 10,000 jin of raw kelp.

    Cultivating kelp in the South China Sea is a pioneering undertaking in China's aquaculture industry. The kelp seedlings transported from Lushun-Dalian at the end of last year to Shantou special district, after more than three months of careful cultivation, have now generally grown to 80 to 90 centimeters, with the longest reaching 1.2 meters. They can grow two to three centimeters per day, and in colder weather, the growth rate reaches four centimeters, almost approaching the fastest growth rate in the north. Currently, workers at various coastal mariculture farms and aquaculture workers in the people's communes are carrying out meticulous management work to promote rapid kelp growth.

    In order to further develop kelp production, this special district has decided to expand the kelp farming area by another 12,000 mu this year.

    汕头试养海带可望丰收
    据新华社讯　广东省汕头专区沿海各县试验养殖的海带，目前生长良好，预计到4月份每亩就可收获一万斤左右的生海带。
    在南海养殖海带，是我国养殖事业的一个创举。去年底汕头专区从旅大运回来的海带苗，经过三个多月的精心培育，现在已普遍长到八十至九十公分，最长的达到一点二公尺，一昼夜能生长二至三公分，在较冷天气中，生长速度达到四公分，几乎接近北方生长的最快速度。目前沿海各海水养殖场的工人和人民公社的养殖员正进行细致的管理工作，促使海带快速生长。
    为了进一步发展海带生产，这个专区已决定在今年内再扩展一万二千亩海带养殖面积。
