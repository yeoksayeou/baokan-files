    Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Silkworm Cocoon Production
    By Our Staff Commentator
    With the rapid development of socialist construction, the uses of silk are becoming wider and wider, and the demand is increasing. Silk is not only an important raw material in the textile industry, but also an indispensable "insulator" in electrical machinery. Without it, the development of these industries will be hindered. Silk has a wide range of uses, high economic value, and a short production cycle. It is a very important economic crop for people's communes to develop commodity production, expand capital accumulation, and increase the income of their members. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, in its "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes," and the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, in its "Ten Initiatives," both clearly stated that silkworm production should have a faster development. The people's communes in the vast silk-producing areas should redouble their efforts to strive for a greater leap forward in silkworm cocoon production in 1959.
    Last year, China's sericulture production saw many large-scale bumper harvests and high-yield bumper harvests. In terms of mulberry silkworms, six counties across the country achieved a production of 100 jin of cocoons per mu. In Qinliu People's Commune, Fanshun County, Guangdong Province, 305 mu of mulberry gardens created a high-yield record of 11,000 jin of mulberry leaves and 1,119 jin of silkworm cocoons per mu. In terms of tussah silkworms, more than 6.41 million moths achieved "100 moths, 10,000 cocoons" last year. In terms of mulberry tree cultivation, various localities also created the experience of raising seedlings and planting mulberry trees in the same year; planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms in the same year, achieving a double harvest of silkworms and mulberry trees. In terms of feeding methods, advanced feeding methods have been created to raise silkworms multiple times, greatly increasing the yield of summer and autumn cocoons. These advanced experiences and advanced working methods are all favorable conditions for us to strive for a great leap forward in sericulture this year. Coupled with China's rich tussah forest resources, and the great development of mulberry gardens through last year's efforts, it is entirely possible to double or even triple silkworm cocoon production. Currently, all silk-producing areas must first and foremost focus on the extremely important link of spring silkworm production. A high-yield and bumper harvest of spring silkworms is the first key to a greater leap forward in 1959. At present, the spring silkworm season is approaching very closely, and the people's communes in all silk-producing areas must immediately do all the preparatory work before silkworm rearing. In accordance with the increase in the number of silkworms raised, rationally arrange and build more silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools, and do a good job in the supply of materials.
    Last year, silkworm diseases were relatively serious. Before raising silkworms, all localities should conduct a comprehensive and thorough disinfection of silkworm rearing rooms and silkworm rearing tools to ensure the safe production of spring silkworms, and strive for the output of spring silkworms to reach about two-thirds of the total cocoon output for the whole year, firing the first shot for achieving a greater leap forward in silkworm cocoon production this year.
    Secondly, we must vigorously implement multiple silkworm rearings to achieve balanced production throughout the year. According to the experience of 1958, multiple silkworm rearings can be implemented throughout the country: the Pearl River Basin can increase from seven to eight rearings in the past to eight to ten rearings; the Yangtze River Basin can increase from three to four rearings to five to seven rearings; and the Yellow River Basin and areas north of the Yellow River can increase from one to two rearings to three to four rearings. Implementing multiple silkworm rearings can not only make full use of mulberry leaves, but also greatly increase the production of silkworm cocoons. It should be fully promoted in 1959 to achieve "high yields in all seasons and bumper harvests throughout the year."
    Thirdly, we must vigorously promote the successful experience of 1958. All silk-producing areas should carry out large-scale high-yield movements on about 20% of the mulberry fields and tussah forests. The Pearl River Basin should carry out a movement to achieve "5,000 jin of leaves and 500 jin of cocoons per mu," the Yangtze River Basin should carry out a movement to achieve "1,000 jin of leaves and 100 jin of cocoons per mu," and the Yellow River Basin and areas north of the Yellow River should carry out a movement to achieve "800 jin of leaves and 80 jin of cocoons per mu" and "100 moths, 10,000 cocoons" for tussah silkworms, in order to complete and overfulfill the glorious task of a greater leap forward in silkworm cocoon production in 1959.

    力争蚕茧生产更大跃进
    本报评论员
    随着社会主义建设事业迅速发展，蚕丝的用途越来越广，需要量越来越多了。蚕丝不仅是纺织工业上的重要原料，也是电器机械上不能缺少的“绝缘物”，缺了它就会障碍着这些工业的发展。蚕丝用途广、经济价值高、生产周期短，是人民公社发展商品生产、扩大资金积累、增加社员收入的一种很重要的经济作物。党的八届六中全会在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中，全国农业先进单位代表会议在“十大倡议”中都明确提出蚕丝生产应该有一个更快的发展。广大蚕区的人民公社应该加倍努力，力争1959年的蚕茧生产有一个更大的跃进。
    去年，我国的蚕桑生产出现了很多大面积丰产和高额丰产。桑蚕方面全国出现了六个蚕茧百斤县。广东省番顺县勤流人民公社三百零五亩桑园，更创造了亩产桑叶一万一千斤、蚕茧一千一百一十九斤的高额丰产纪录。柞蚕方面，去年实现“百头蛾、万粒茧”的共六百四十一万多蛾。在桑树栽培方面，1958年各地还创造了当年育苗、当年栽桑；当年栽桑、当年养蚕，蚕、桑双丰收的经验。在饲养方法方面，更创造了多次养蚕，大大增加夏秋茧产量的先进饲养方法。这些先进的经验和先进工作方法，都是我们争取今年蚕桑大跃进的有利条件。加上我国柞林资源丰富，桑园经过去年的努力栽培，也有很大发展等条件，实现蚕茧翻一番到两番是完全可能的。当前，各蚕区首先要紧紧抓住春蚕生产这个极为重要的环节。春蚕高产丰收是1959年更大跃进的第一个关键。目前春蚕期已很迫近，各蚕区人民公社必须立即做好养蚕前的一切准备工作。根据养蚕数量的增加，合理安排和增修蚕室、蚕具，做好物资供应工作。
    去年蚕病比较严重，各地在养蚕前，应该对蚕室蚕具进行全面彻底消毒，保证春蚕安全生产，力争春蚕产量达到全年产茧量的三分之二左右，为实现今年蚕茧生产更大跃进打响第一炮。
    其次，要大力实行多次养蚕，达到全年均衡生产。根据1958年经验，全国各地都可实行多次养蚕：珠江流域可由过去养蚕七到八次增加到八到十次；长江流域可由三到四次增加到五到七次；黄河流域和黄河以北地区可由一到二次增加到三到四次。实行多次养蚕既可充分利用桑叶又能大量增产蚕茧，1959年应该全面推行，达到“四季高产，全年丰收”。
    第三要大力推广1958年成功经验。各蚕区应该以20％左右的桑田、柞林开展大面积高产运动。珠江流域要开展亩产“五千斤叶、五百斤茧”、长江流域要开展亩产“千斤叶、百斤茧”，黄河流域和黄河以北地区要开展亩产“八百斤叶、八十斤茧”和柞蚕“百头蛾，万粒茧”的大面积丰产运动，为完成和超额完成1959年蚕茧生产更大跃进的光荣任务而努力。
