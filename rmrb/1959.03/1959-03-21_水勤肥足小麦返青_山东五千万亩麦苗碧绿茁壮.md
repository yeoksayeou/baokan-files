Sufficient Water and Fertilizer Revitalize Wheat
Shandong's 50 Million Mu of Wheat Seedlings are Lush and Thriving

    Jinan, March 20th (from our newspaper) – Shandong Province's competition to win the wheat revitalization stage has entered the decisive phase. Hundreds of thousands of field management personnel are using iron will to wage a large-scale water diversion and fertilization campaign in drylands, highlands, mountain slopes, backward fields, and slow-progress areas. They are determined to ensure that all 50 million mu of wheat fields across the province are fully fed and watered in a short period of time, achieving a comprehensive victory in wheat revitalization.
    Difficulties cannot scare heroes, and high mountains cannot stop the great power of the People's Communes. Those areas lacking water and fertilizer are building dams to block rivers and digging springs in ditches to bring water up mountains and across large ravines to irrigate wheat fields. In Yidu County, the Wuli Commune in the mountainous area, with more than 28,000 mu of wheat, could not irrigate by gravity flow due to the undulating mountains and lack of water sources. The commune members formed a 2,900-person water-carrying army to transport water from several miles away. The Alliance and Xuguang West Management Areas of this commune carried water from the Ximen River, eleven li away, with more than 300 people forming a long snake formation. During the day, water buckets and pots formed a water dragon, and at night, lanterns and torches formed a fire dragon. The Party Committee Secretary and the head of the commune are the vanguard of this team, competing with the commune members in their efforts. This commune's battle to boost revitalization fertilizer and water concluded victoriously on the 9th. In Wendeng County, the Puji Commune launched a large-scale fertilizer transport campaign to target third-class seedlings on remote slopes. The first and second production teams launched a competition, both organizing vehicles to transport fertilizer in the rain, turning all third-class seedlings into high-yield seedlings.
    In overcoming the difficulties of irrigation, People's Communes in various regions also organized large-scale cooperation. The industrial departments of various counties and communes in the Liaocheng area repaired and manufactured water lifting tools to help poor villages and teams first. Advanced areas that had already completed irrigation and topdressing tasks also transferred water equipment and transportation tools to support backward communes and teams. As a result, the enthusiasm of backward areas to catch up with advanced areas is even greater.
    In order to seize the time and take the initiative, Party committees at all levels have recently transferred personnel to strengthen the wheat field management front. Currently, more than 10 million laborers across the province are engaged in irrigation and topdressing every day, advancing at a rate of 2.3 million mu of topdressing and 800,000 mu of irrigation per day. Now, more than 35 million mu of wheat in the province have been adequately fertilized for revitalization, and more than 16 million mu of wheat have been thoroughly irrigated for revitalization. In more than ten counties and cities, such as Shou Zhang and Fan County, the topdressing area has reached 70% to 90%, and the irrigation area has reached 60% to 80%. Many advanced People's Communes have already raised the victorious red flag of universal topdressing, universal irrigation, and the general upgrading of third-class seedlings. These advanced areas have formed a 10,000-person inspection and evaluation team, conducting inspections plot by plot and ridge by ridge, supplementing lessons while inspecting, adding water where there is a lack of water, replenishing fertilizer where there is a lack of fertilizer, controlling insects when encountering insects, and striving for every seedling. The millions of high-yield champions who manage high-yield wheat are even more outstanding. They never leave their posts, inspecting several times a day. Many high-yield fields have already achieved five irrigations and five fertilizations. They manage the 23 million mu of high-yield wheat seedlings in the province like horse manes. Generally, they grow to six or seven inches high, with four or five tillers per plant and an average of about 1.5 million plants per mu. These lush green wheat high-yield seedlings create a boundless green pattern across the entire Shandong landscape.
    These encouraging scenes have further inspired the confidence of the entire Party and people of Shandong to vow to seize a thousand jin per mu of wheat province. Now, areas with relatively slow progress are dividing the personnel managing wheat fields into several groups: irrigation, water transportation, topdressing, fertilizer transportation, and weeding. They are accelerating their pace to catch up with the advanced. The advanced areas, on the one hand, are conducting large-scale inspections and supplementary lessons, and on the other hand, are preparing materials and supplies to welcome the new battle of the wheat jointing stage.

    水勤肥足小麦返青
    山东五千万亩麦苗碧绿茁壮
    本报济南20日电　山东省大战小麦返青关的竞赛运动，进入决战阶段。各地成千上万的麦田管理大军，以钢铁般的战斗意志，向缺水少肥的旱田高地、山岭远坡、落后田苗和进展迟缓的地区大兴引水施肥运动，他们决心在短时期内让全省五千多万亩小麦垄垄株株吃足喝饱，取得小麦返青的全面胜利。
    困难吓不倒英雄汉，高山挡不住人民公社的巨大威力。那些缺水缺肥的地区，拦河筑坝，闸沟挖泉，把水车上高山，引过大沟，灌溉麦地。益都县山区的五里公社二万八千多亩小麦，因为山岭起伏水源缺乏，不能自流灌溉，社员们组成一支二千九百多人的挑水大军，从几里以外运水上山。这个公社的联盟、旭光西管理区，到十一华里之外的西门河挑水，三百多人摆开一条长蛇阵。白天水桶、罐子形成一条水龙，夜晚灯笼火把形成一条火龙。社党委书记、社长是这支队伍的尖兵，他们和社员竞赛着干。这个公社大兴返青肥、水的战斗，已于9日告捷。文登县的铺集公社为了向边远坡地的三类苗进军，大摆运肥阵。第一、二两个生产队开展竞赛，他们都组织车辆，冒雨运肥，把所有三类苗变成丰产苗。
    在克服浇水的困难中，各地人民公社还组织了大协作。聊城专区各县、社工业部门大修大造提水工具，首先帮助穷村穷队；已经完成浇水、追肥任务的先进地区，也纷纷抽调水具、运输工具支援后进社、队。因此这个地区后进赶先进的劲头更大。
    各级党委为了抢时间、争主动，最近又纷纷调兵遣将加强麦田管理战线。现在全省每天投入浇水追肥的劳力已达一千多万人，每日以追肥二百三十万亩，浇水八十万亩的速度向前挺进。现在全省已有三千五百多万亩小麦施足了返青肥，一千六百多万亩小麦浇透了返青水。寿张、范县等十多个县、市，追肥面积已达70％到90％，浇水面积达60％到80％。许多先进的人民公社，已经举起了普追、普浇、促使三类苗普遍升级的胜利红旗。这些先进地区组成了万人检查评比团，逐块逐垄进行检查，边检查边补课，缺水加水，缺肥补肥，遇虫治虫、棵苗必争。管理高额丰产麦的数百万丰产健将，更加出色。他们一时也不离开阵地，一天检查好几遍，很多丰产田已经达到五水五肥。他们把全省二千三百万亩丰产麦苗管理得像马鬃一样，一般都长到六、七寸高，每株分蘖四、五个，每亩平均一百五十万株左右。这些碧绿遍野的小麦丰产苗，把山东整个大地构成了一幅极目无边的绿色图案。
    这些振奋人心的景象，进一步鼓舞了山东全党全民誓夺小麦千斤省的信心。现在进展比较迟缓的地区，把管理麦田的人马，分作浇水、运水、追肥、运肥、锄草等几路大军，快马加鞭追赶先进。那些先进的地区，一方面进行大检查大补课，一方面备物备料，迎接小麦拔节关的新战斗。　（胡雷）（附图片）
