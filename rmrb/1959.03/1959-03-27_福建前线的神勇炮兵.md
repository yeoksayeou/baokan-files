The Valiant Artillery on the Fujian Front

The Artillery's Eyes

On the front line, people affectionately call artillery reconnaissance soldiers the "artillery's eyes." This is because any modern artillery unit, without precise observation and calculation, cannot find its target and accurately direct its fire to bombard the enemy.

One day, the artillery battle was very fierce. Although the enemy's artillery fire was quickly suppressed by our artillery fire, the accuracy with which the enemy had been shelling our peaceful villages and a certain position for the past few days aroused the great attention of our reconnaissance soldiers. They realized that the enemy must have set up a new command post in a more advantageous position. They vowed to find it and knock it out. Thus, a difficult reconnaissance battle began.

Reconnaissance platoon leader Shen Qisong convened several "Zhuge Liang meetings" with the reconnaissance soldiers. It was speculated that a high ground protruding from the beach on the eastern half of Kinmen Island was the best location for the enemy to observe and command against us. However, it was a bare mountain, and the enemy had not dared to set up a command post there in the past, and no suspicious signs had been found in the past few days. But, was it possible that the enemy was hiding cleverly? In order to further uncover this secret, reconnaissance platoon leader Shen Qisong was ordered to lead a reconnaissance team to the front beach, braving the threat of enemy artillery fire, to conduct close reconnaissance and find the enemy's observation post that posed the greatest threat to us.

Shen Qisong led reconnaissance soldiers Shao Heng'an and Huang Xiagang to set off for the beach at night. They observed incessantly from morning till night. They only left the beach after the night had covered the isolated island. However, after a hard day's work, although they had found some other targets, they had not found the enemy's observation post and command post. The next day, as soon as it dawned, they continued to search this high ground with large periscopes. Suddenly, Huang Xiagang saw a shadow of a human head in his periscope flashing on the top of the mountain and then disappearing. "Good boy! You can't escape now!" Huang Xiagang shouted excitedly. At the same time, he tracked and searched with Shen Qisong and Shao Heng'an. In less than a quarter of an hour, the three of them simultaneously spotted a human head moving rapidly down the hillside towards the back of the mountain from their periscopes. They also discovered the enemy's bunker and a periscope hole on the right side of the mountain peak as thin as a gray-black line. They found the enemy's command post and another hidden observation post on the left side of the high ground.

The secret was revealed, and their eyes were also covered with red streaks. Soon, two small green dots were added to the commander's military map. Then, after a burst of fierce shelling, the enemy's highest observation post, which had been directing enemy artillery fire to indiscriminately bomb our peaceful villages for the past few days, was destroyed by our army.

Saving Comrades from Fire

During one of the most intense artillery battles on the Fujian front, suddenly, an enemy shell hit one of our artillery positions, igniting the powder packs in the ammunition chamber, causing thick smoke and flames. The artillery commander Zhang Zuowu's clothes were on fire. His flesh was burning with excruciating pain. But remembering that there were still two soldiers trapped by the fire in the gun position, he threw himself down without regard for his own safety, rolled over, and rushed into the thick smoke and flames to rescue his comrades. The smoke and fire burned his eyes, making it impossible to open them. He crawled on the ground looking for the soldiers. His hands and legs were covered with dense blisters from the fire, and every step he crawled was agonizing. However, the lofty desire to rescue his comrades supported him in moving forward courageously. He rolled to the side of the gun position and carried one soldier out on his back. Then, he carried the second wounded soldier from the fire, also in a rolling manner. However, the fire spread quickly, and he had not completely escaped the danger after rolling for a while. He was already exhausted. Fortunately, there was a shell crater outside the ring of fire, so he carried the wounded soldier into the crater, and lay prone on the edge of the crater, using his body to block the flames from burning the soldier again. When other soldiers arrived to rescue them, Zhang Zuowu was too burned to move. He only smiled and said, "My comrades' lives are more precious than mine. Their survival is my greatest happiness."

Night Annihilation of the Flying Thief

This battle took place in the Zhenhai area on the Fujian front, on the night before last year's National Day.

At 7:50 p.m., the command post suddenly issued an emergency alert of an enemy aircraft approaching. The soldiers jumped onto the gun platforms as if flying, each taking their position. The aimer was quickly acquiring the target, and the ammunition handler clicked and clacked, loading the ready-to-fire shells. In an instant, all the gun muzzles were pointed towards the southeast sea and sky. Everyone was ready for battle. At this moment, two small red lights, sometimes bright and sometimes dim, faintly appeared in the high altitude between Kinmen and Dongding Island, and moved rapidly towards the right side of the No. 3 artillery battery's position. Almost at the same time as the small red lights appeared, the aimer shouted the command "Target acquired!" The huge gun muzzle closely followed the increasingly close target.

Jia Dequan, the company clerk in the No. 2 gun position of the No. 3 artillery battery, had become an all-round artilleryman during the "One Specialization, Multiple Skills" campaign. At that time, the No. 2 gunner was hospitalized due to illness, and he volunteered to come and replace the No. 2 gunner to perform combat tasks. At this time, a C-46 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft had sneaked into the sky above, and cunningly suddenly turned its nose, attempting to change course. Taking advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft's shortcut 90-degree turn, Jia Dequan vigorously stepped on the firing machine with both feet and fired a short burst. All three shells hit the fuselage of the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, which immediately burst into flames. At the same time, all the anti-aircraft guns on the position and the various anti-aircraft weapons on the naval gunboats patrolling the sea fiercely fired dense artillery fire at the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. This Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, riddled with bullets, plunged into the sea near Dongding Island with a burst of violent explosions. Chiang Kai-shek's "Lieutenant Aviation Officer" Hua Wulin and "Lieutenant Co-pilot" Liu Chengli, who parachuted to escape, were immediately captured alive by the People's Navy in the sea.

This excellent night air defense operation took only one minute. When the anti-aircraft artillerymen cheered for victory, they composed and sang a poem:

　　“With me at the peace outpost,
　　The U.S.-Chiang flying thief should not be reckless.
　　Dare to provoke me,
　　Smash your dog's head!”

    福建前线的神勇炮兵
    炮兵的眼睛
    在的线，人们总是亲昵地称炮兵侦察兵是“炮兵的眼晴”。这是因为任何一个现代炮兵部队，离开了精确的观察和测算，就无法找到目标，无法准确地指挥火炮，轰击敌人。
    有一天，炮战进行得十分激烈。虽然敌人的炮火很快就被我军炮火压制下去了，但是，这几天来敌人对我和平村镇和某阵地打得很准确，却引起了我军侦察兵的极大注意。他们意识到敌人一定在一个更为有利的位置上设立了新的指挥所。他们发誓要把它找出来，敲掉它。于是，一场艰苦的侦察战斗便开始了。
    侦察排长沈琦松召集侦察兵开了几次“诸葛亮会”。据推测，突出在金门东半岛海滩上的一个高地是敌人对我进行观察和指挥的最好位置。可是，那是一个光山，过去敌人没敢在上设指挥所，这两天也没有发现什么可疑的征候。但是，是不是敌人隐蔽得巧妙呢？为了进一步揭开这个秘密，侦察排长沈琦松奉命率领侦察组到前沿海滩冒着敌人的炮火威胁进行抵近侦察，找出对我威胁最大的敌人的观察所。
    沈琦松带着侦察兵邵恒安和黄霞章连夜出发来到海边。他们从早到晚不停地观察。直到夜幕盖住了孤岛才离开海滩。可是，辛苦了一天，虽然也发现了一些其它的目标，但是却没有找出敌人的观察所和指挥所来。第二天天刚亮他们就又继续拿起大潜望镜搜索这个高地。突然，黄霞章的潜望镜里有一个人头的影子在山顶上一闪就消失了。“好小子！你跑不了啦！”黄霞章兴奋地大喊起来。同时和沈琦松、邵恒安一起跟踪搜索。不到一刻钟，三人又同时从潜望镜里发现了一个人头沿着山坡迅速向山背移去，并且发现了敌人的地堡和山峰右侧一条细得像灰黑色的细线一样的潜望孔，找到了敌人的指挥所和高地左侧的另一个隐蔽的观察所。
    秘密揭开了，他们的眼睛里也布满了红丝。不久，在指挥员的军用地图上增加了两个绿色小点。接着，一阵猛烈的炮击，这个几天来一直指挥敌人炮火滥轰我和平村镇的敌军最高的观察所就被我军摧毁了。
    火中救战友
    在福建前线最激烈的一次炮战中，突然，一发敌人打来的炮弹击中了我军某炮位，打着了弹药室里的药包，燃起了浓烟烈火。炮长张作武的衣服被烧着了。肉被烧得痛如刀割。但他想起炮位上还有两个战士被烈火封住了，就奋不顾身地就地一滚，冲进浓烟烈火中去救自己的战友，烟火烤得他睁不开眼。他就在地上爬着寻找战士。他的手和腿被火烧起了密密麻麻的水泡，每爬一步都疼痛难忍。但是，抢救战友的崇高愿望支持他奋勇前进。他滚到炮位旁边背出了一个战士。接着，又抱着第二个被火烧伤的战士从火中向外滚。但是，火势蔓延很快，他滚了好一会还没有完全脱离危险，已经精疲力竭了。正好烈火圈外有一个弹坑，他就把这个负伤的战士抱进坑内，自己伏在弹坑的边沿，用身体挡住火苗，不让火再烧到这个战士。当其它战士赶来抢救时，张作武已经被火烧得不能动弹了。他只是含笑说：“战友的生命比我更宝贵，他们能活着就是我最大的幸福了。”
    夜歼飞贼
    这场战斗发生在福建前线镇海地区，时间是去年国庆前夕的夜间。
    七时五十分，指挥所突然发出敌机来袭的紧急警报。战士们飞也似地跳上炮盘，各就本位。瞄准手在迅速地捕捉目标，弹药手咔喳咔喳地压满了待发的炮弹。转瞬间，所有的炮口都指向东南海空。每一个人都作好了战斗准备。这时，从金门和东椗岛之间高空里隐约出现了两只时明时暗的小红灯，并迅速地向炮三班阵地右侧方向移动。几乎是在小红灯出现的同时，瞄准手喊出了“目标捕住！”的口令；巨大的炮口紧紧地跟着越来越近的目标转动。
    在炮三班二炮手战位上的连部文书贾德全，是在开展“一专多能”运动中成为全能炮手的。当时，二炮手因病住院了，他自告奋勇跑来顶替二炮手执行战斗任务。这时，一架C—46型蒋机已窜入上空，并狡猾地突然调转机头，企图改变航向。贾德全趁着蒋机九十度捷径转弯时两脚猛力蹬住发火机，急促地打出一个短点射。三发炮弹全部击中了这架蒋机的机身，蒋机当即燃起一团烈火。与此同时，阵地上所有的高射炮和正在海上巡逻的海军炮艇上的各种高射火器，都迅猛地向蒋机射出了密集的炮火。这架遍体中弹的蒋机在一阵猛烈的爆炸声中，一头栽进东椗岛附近的大海里。跳伞逃命的蒋军“上尉飞行官”华武麟和“上尉副驾驶”刘承理，当即在大海里被人民海军活捉了。
    这次出色的夜间对空作战，仅仅用了一分钟。高射炮兵们在欢呼胜利时编诗唱道：
      “和平前哨有我在，美蒋飞贼休胡赖，
       敢向老子来挑衅，砸碎你的狗脑袋！”
