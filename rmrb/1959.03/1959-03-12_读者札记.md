Liu Mianzhi
Tang Shunzhi on Book Printing in the Ming Dynasty

	Reading old books requires attention to the edition. It's certainly reasonable to want books with fewer misprints, published earlier, and closer to the original. However, some people focus solely on rare editions, mechanically pursuing specific versions, not for the sake of truth but for the sake of "rarity" and "antiquity." They don't really care about the content of the book. The ancient story of "buying the casket and returning the pearl" comes to mind; these people are quite similar.

	Is reading about the form of the book, the edition of the book, or the content of the book?

	Song and Yuan editions are highly valued by those who focus on editions. Reluctantly, Ming editions are also acceptable.

	The Ming Dynasty saw the most collections of writings printed, and they also loved to print anthologies.

	Also in the Ming Dynasty, there was a man named Tang Shunzhi, who also had a collection of writings called the "Jingchuan Anthology." This person was very interesting, interesting because he left a will instructing his descendants not to print his anthology. But his descendants printed it anyway, and this anthology has been passed down to this day.

	Here are two of his letters, both severely criticizing the printing of anthologies:

	I often think that there are a few things in the world that everyone is accustomed to seeing but are utterly ridiculous. One is that some petty people, like wine sellers and butchers, must have an epitaph after their death if they have a bowl of rice to eat. The other is that high-ranking officials, those who have passed the imperial examinations and have some reputation, must have a collection of poetry and prose printed after their death. It's as if living requires drinking water and eating food, and dying requires clothing, a coffin, and a burial, with nothing missing. This situation not only didn't exist before the Three Dynasties, but it was definitely not like this before the Han and Tang Dynasties.

	Fortunately, these epitaphs and poetry collections all disappear soon enough.

	However, despite the destruction of many, there are still plenty left. If some are not destroyed and all are kept, even if the world were used as a bookshelf, there wouldn't be enough space. If every family collected this kind of writing and used Qin Shi Huang's method to use it as firewood, the price of coal and bamboo in the southern mountains would surely decrease. Laughable, laughable.

	I usually think that printing writings is a shameless act. I cannot guarantee that idle people will create this karma after my death. As for my own children, I must leave a will explaining this intention and not allow them to create this karma. (Volume Six, Reply to Wang Zunyan)

In another letter, he said:

	Today's so-called literary collections are everywhere, in great abundance. In reality, not a single word is useful. The authors originally wanted to achieve immortality through them, but the result is the opposite; they only expose their "ugliness" and are ridiculed. Isn't this called a literary disaster? (Ibid., Letter to Bu Wuxi)

	He spoke very bluntly. Although it's a bit excessive, for example, some wine sellers and butchers having an epitaph may not be entirely unacceptable, and the content of some printed anthologies may not all be useless. Printing writings cannot be generally considered a shameless act. Although some places are not accurate, for example, there was no printing technology at all before the Three Dynasties, how could there possibly be large-scale printing of literary collections? The same is true for the Han and Tang Dynasties. However, it does point out the atmosphere of the Ming Dynasty, where books were printed recklessly, and some of the printed books were truly unacceptable.

	As for the anthologies printed by the Ming people, they changed their titles, cut corners, plagiarized from east to west, and cobbled things together. There are many problems. Although many are good and do preserve many useful things, providing convenience to people, their contribution is significant. However, not all that has been passed down is good.

	Why did this era have such a reckless trend of printing books?

	One reason is economic. After the tenth century, printing technology developed, and many cities between the Yuan and Ming dynasties became printing centers. Wood and engravers were readily available. As long as you were willing to spend money, you could print books. In particular, local officials could use their authority or the convenience of compiling local chronicles to include their own poetry and prose. Even if you weren't a current local official, as long as you had been a government official in the capital or had achieved some academic success, you could ask a local official with whom you had "year-end ties" or "generational ties" to handle it. If you don't believe me, check the existing Ming anthologies; can you find any that weren't written by officials or people who had achieved some academic success?

	Another reason is political. Qing Dynasty Jiang Chaobo's "Nanchun Kuyyu" states:

		Bribery was very prevalent in the Ming Dynasty officialdom.

	According to the rules, when sending money as a bribe, it was necessary to include books, especially newly printed books. This led to widespread book printing, even without enough time for proofreading. For example, Chen Zhi's "Muzhong Collection" was reprinted by Deng Huai, the prefect of Wenzhou during the Hongzhi period, and Du Mu's "Nanhao Poetry Talk" was printed by Huang Huan, the prefect of Hezhou. The prefaces all said that they were donating their salaries to print and disseminate the books widely. Such examples are numerous. Using books as a cover for bribery seemed more elegant, and there was a special term for it: "book gift." Ming Dynasty Xu Shupi's "Shixiao Lu" states:

	In the past, "book gifts" were only important in the two yamen, and at most were only thirty or forty taels of silver. When my father-in-law was a member of the Hanlin Academy, foreign officials sent book gifts, with the lesser ones being only three or four taels of silver. At that time, it was only regarded as a normal matter of social interaction and did not attract much attention. Later, the court strictly prohibited it. As a result, white [silver] was no longer sent, and it was replaced by yellow gold. But it was too cumbersome, so it was simply replaced by round, shiny white pearls. In recent years, when foreign officials and Beijing officials meet, they often exchange greetings and engage in transactions with both hands.

	This was the political atmosphere of the late Ming Dynasty, and it explains why there were so many books printed in the Ming Dynasty, and why they were so rampant.

    唐顺之论明代刻书
    读古书要讲究版本，要求刻的书错字少一些，刊行的时代早一些，更近于原来面貌一些，这原是无可厚非的事。但是，也有那么一些人，片面地讲究孤本，机械地追求版本，其目的不是为了求真，而是为了“孤”，为了“古”，对于书的内容，倒不十分在意，古代有个“买椟还珠”的故事，我看，这类人倒很像。
    读书，是读书的形式，读书的版本，还是读书的内容呢？
    宋版，元版，讲版本的人很重视，不得已而求其次，明版也将就。
    明朝人刻文集最多，也很喜欢刻丛书。
    也就是在明朝，有个唐顺之，他也有部文集，叫荆川文集。这个人很有趣，有趣在立下遗嘱叫后人不要给他刻文集，而后人偏给他刻文集，这部文集还留传到现在。
    下面是他的两封信，都是大骂特骂刻文集的：
    我常常想起，天地间有那么几件事情，人人见惯而绝是可笑的，一件是有些卖酒杀猪的市井细人，有一碗饭吃，死后必定有一篇墓志。一件是达官贵人，中过举人进士、稍有名目的，死后也必然有一部诗文刻集。好像是活着必得喝水吃饭，死去必得有衣衾棺槨，一样不能缺那样，这种情况，不但三代以前没有，汉、唐以前也绝不是这样。
    幸亏还好，这些墓志也吧，诗文集也吧，不久就都泯灭了。
    不过，尽管毁灭了很多，剩下的还是满屋子。假如不毁掉一些，都留着，即使以天地作书架子，也安顿不下。这种文字，假如家家收藏，用秦始皇办法，作用一番，代替柴火，南山的煤炭竹木，不是都可减价了。可笑，可笑。
    我平常以为刻文字是无廉耻的行为。我死后有闲人作此业障，我不敢保险。至于自家子弟，则必须有遗嘱说破此意，不让他们作这业障。（卷六答王遵岩书）在另一封信里又说：
    今世所谓文集，到处都是，多得很。其实一字无用。作者原来是想靠这个不朽的，结果相反，只会暴露自己的
  “陋”，给人取笑，这不叫作木灾吗？（同上与卜无锡书）说得很痛快。虽然也有些过火，例如卖酒杀猪的有些人有这么篇把墓志，也不一定不可以，有些人刻的文集内容也不见得都是一字无用，刻文字也不能一概而论都是无廉耻之类。虽然也有的地方不对头，例如三代以前根本没有印刷术，怎么有可能大刻其文集，汉、唐这两代也是这样。但是，毕竟说出明代这时期的风气，胡乱刻书，刻的书很有些是要不得的。
    至于明人刻的丛书，改头换面，偷工减料，东抄西袭，胡拼瞎凑，毛病多得很。虽然也有不少是好的，的确保存着许多有用的东西，给人方便，功劳不少。但是，留传下来的不尽都是好的。
    为什么这个时代会有这样胡乱刻书的风气呢？
    一个理由是经济的，十世纪以后，印刷术发达了，元明之间许多城市都成了刻书中心，木头，刻工都方便，只要舍得钱，就可刻书。特别是作地方官的人，可以利用职权，或者通过修地方志的方便，附带刻自己的诗文。即使不是现任地方官，只要作过京官，有过功名的，也可以通过有什么“年谊”，“世谊”的地方官来办。不信，请查查现存的明人文集，能找出几个不是作过官，或是有过功名的。
    另一个是政治的。清蒋超伯南漘楛语：
        明代官场，行贿风气很盛。
    按规矩送钱时一定要配以书，特别是新刻的书。闹得到处刻书，连校对也来不及了。如陈埴木钟集，是宏治时温州知府邓淮重刻的，都穆的南濠诗话是和州知州黄桓所刻的，序文上都说是捐俸绣梓，用广流传，像这样的不一而足。行贿用书陪衬，显得雅一些，有个专门名词叫书帕。明人徐树丕识小录四说：
    往时书帕，惟重两衙门，最多也不过三四十两银子。外舅作翰林时，外官送书帕，少的不过三四两银子，那时也不过作为往来交际常事，不大引起注意。后来朝廷严厉禁止，结果，白的不送了，换成黄的金子，又嫌累赘，索性换成圆的白的发光的珠子了，近年来外官和京官相见，往往一面作揖
    寒暄，两手就作交易。
    这就是明代后期的政治风气，也就是明代刻书特别多，特别滥的道理。
