Rushing to "Finish Up" - A Good Start and a Good Finish
Beijing Concentrates Efforts to Ensure Eighteen Newly Built Units are Put Into Production as Early as Possible

This newspaper reports: While guaranteeing the completion of key construction projects, Beijing's industrial capital construction departments are also making intensive efforts to complete the final stages of work on eighteen factories.

In the first quarter of this year, approximately half of the factories under construction in Beijing have entered the final stages. Because finishing work is often fragmented and of lower value, it is often easily overlooked. In light of this situation, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Capital Construction Committee, in arranging the first quarter's projects, clearly put forward the policy of resolutely shortening the battle lines and concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles: focusing on a few key points and speeding up the final stages of construction. This approach has two major benefits: first, it can promote the early completion of new enterprises and accelerate the production of urgently needed national products; second, because the workload of the finishing touches is not large, it can be completed with short-term concentrated efforts, which can quickly transfer the construction forces and construction equipment from this part of the project to support other key projects.

In the process of speeding up the completion of the final stages of construction, all capital construction departments, under the leadership of the Party committees, are actively organizing construction forces to carry out crash construction. For some of the larger finishing projects, unified queuing and batch crash construction are also carried out according to the production needs of the factory. The Second Beijing Construction Engineering Company, which is undertaking eight finishing projects, has mostly entered the stage of water and electricity installation. Based on the arrival of equipment and the supply of small hardware materials, this company decided to concentrate its efforts on the finishing work of the Beijing Chemical Plant and the Beijing Plastics Plant first. The other six finishing projects are planned to be completed in batches. When installing the final phase of the No. 3 generating unit at the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, the leadership promptly convened a mobilization meeting for the final phase of the project, putting forward the fighting slogan of "fighting to the end, adding the last bit of effort, and winning the decisive battle." As a result, it took only fifty-six days to complete the entire installation project, which was sixty days faster than the installation of the No. 1 unit, which had half the generating capacity, and the quality was good.

The workers of many machinery manufacturing factories, in order to ensure that the finishing work of these new enterprises can be completed on schedule, are also rushing to complete the finishing work, so that the equipment can be quickly put into production as a complete set. The Beijing Metal Structure Factory rushed to complete the finishing production of twenty-one items of equipment in six days, and promptly supplied the non-standard equipment urgently needed for the matching of five projects such as the Beijing Steam Turbine Generator Factory and the Beijing Refractory Materials Factory.

### 突击“收尾”　善始善终  北京集中力量保证十八个新建单位及早投入生产

    突击“收尾”　善始善终
    北京集中力量保证十八个新建单位及早投入生产
    本报讯　北京工业基本建设部门在保证完成重点工程项目的同时，抓紧突击十八个工厂的收尾工程。
    今年第一季度，北京正在兴建的工厂项目中，约有二分之一的工厂已进入收尾阶段。由于收尾工程都比较零碎，产值较低，常常容易被人忽视。根据这个情况，中共北京市委工业基本建设委员会在安排第一季度工程项目时，明确地提出坚决采取缩短战线，集中力量打歼灭战的方针：突击少数重点，抓紧收尾工程。采取这种做法，有两大好处：第一，能促使新建企业早日竣工，提前生产国家急需的产品；第二，由于收尾工程的工作量不大，短期突击即可完工，这就可以把这一部分工程的建筑力量和施工设备迅速调出来支援其他重点工程。
    在抓紧完成收尾工程的过程中，各基本建设部门在党委领导下，都积极地组织施工力量，进行突击修建。对一些工作量比较大的收尾工程，还按照工厂生产的需要，进行统一排队，分批突击。北京市第二建筑工程公司承担的八项收尾工程，绝大部分已经进入水电安装阶段。这个公司根据设备到货和小五金材料供应情况，决定集中力量先突击北京化工厂和北京塑料厂的收尾工程。其他六项收尾工程准备分批突击完成。北京热电厂在安装三号机组的结尾工程时，领导上及时召开了结尾工程动员大会，提出“苦战到底，加最后一把劲，打好决定性一仗”的战斗口号。结果，只用了五十六天就完成全部安装工程，速度比安装发电能力少一半的一号机组还要快六十天，而且质量良好。
    许多机械制造工厂的职工，为了保证这批新建企业的收尾工程能够按期竣工，也都抓紧突击完成扫尾活，使设备迅速成套投入生产。北京市金属结构工厂在六天中，突击完成了二十一项设备的扫尾生产，及时供应了北京汽轮发电机厂、北京耐火材料厂等五项工程急需配套的非标准设备。
