Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 9th: Japanese figures from all walks of life today published written statements in the "Akahata" newspaper, unanimously expressing their support for the joint statement issued on the 3rd by the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party.

    Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that this joint statement points out the fundamental issues in Sino-Japanese relations, which is of great significance. He expressed his hope that the basic direction indicated in the joint statement could be widely understood by the Japanese people. He also stated that he would continue to work to open up Sino-Japanese relations and strive for world peace.

    Kazami Akira, Director-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, said that the joint statement of the two Communist Parties is the foundation for establishing friendly relations between the two countries. He stated that the National Council will redouble its efforts to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations in accordance with the spirit of the joint statement.

    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), pointed out when talking about the Chinese Communist Party's expression of firm support in the joint statement for the struggle of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," that the struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" plays an important role in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East. He said that "Sohyo" is carrying out the spring struggle with the aim of abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as its main slogan.

    Hozumi Shichiro, Acting Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, said that at a time when the Kishi Nobusuke government is clearly moving in the direction of war, the Japanese people expect the Socialist Party not to compromise with it. Therefore, the joint statement issued by the Chinese and Japanese Communist Parties this time can also be regarded as a joint statement by the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese Socialist Party.

    Uchiyama Kanzo, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said that the joint statement points out the path that Japan should take. He said that the Japanese people hope that Japan will take the path of peace and neutrality. However, the current situation in Japan is contrary to this.

    Ogata Shoji, Permanent Director of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out that the two joint statements issued separately by the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Workers' Party analyzed the international situation and various issues that threaten peace. At the same time, they clarified common interests and indicated that they will deal with the forces that threaten peace and strengthen the forces that safeguard peace through mutual cooperation and support. Therefore, these two joint statements point out the direction of the current peace movement in the Far East.

    日本各界人士支持中日两国共产党联合声明
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士今天在“赤旗报”上发表书面谈话，一致表示支持中国共产党代表团同日本共产党代表团在3日发表的联合声明。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁说，这项联合声明指出了日中关系上的根本问题，这是有重大意义的。他表示希望联合声明所指明的基本路线能广泛为日本人民理解。他还表示将继续为打开日中关系和争取世界和平而努力。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章说，两国共产党的联合声明是建立两国间的友好关系的基础。他表示，国民会议将根据联合声明的精神，为打开日中关系的僵局而加倍努力。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在谈到中国共产党在联合声明中表示坚决支持日本共产党和日本人民要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争这一点时指出，争取废除日美
  “安全条约”的斗争在保卫远东和平的斗争中具有重要作用。他说，
  “总评”正在以争取废除日美“安全条约”作为主要口号来开展春季斗争。
    社会党国际局代理局长穗积七郎说，在岸信介政府明确指向战争方向的时候，日本人民期望社会党不要同它妥协，因此中日两国共产党这次发表的联合声明同时可以当作中国共产党同日本社会党的联合声明。
    日中友好协会理事长内山完造说，联合声明指出了日本应当走的道路。他说，日本人民是希望日本走和平、中立的道路的。但是，日本的现状却与此背道而驰。
    日本和平委员会常任理事尾形昭二指出，日本共产党代表团同中国共产党和朝鲜劳动党分别发表的两项联合声明分析了国际形势和威胁和平的各种问题，同时阐明了共同的利害关系，并且表明将在相互合作和支持下对付威胁和平的势力，加强维护和平的力量。因此，这两项联合声明指出了目前远东和平运动的方向。
