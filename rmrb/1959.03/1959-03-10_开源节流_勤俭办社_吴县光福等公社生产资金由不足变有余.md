Increasing Income and Reducing Expenditure, Running Communes Diligently and Frugally
Production Funds of Guangfu and Other Communes in Wu County Change from Insufficient to Surplus

    (Our dispatch) Jiangsu Wu County's Guangfu, Huangdai, and Weiting People's Communes, based on a clear understanding of their financial situation, actively opened up financial resources and balanced their revenue and expenditure plans, so that every penny of the commune's funds could be used on essential needs in a planned way. This has played a positive role in guaranteeing a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.
    Initially, although the three communes had a general plan for developing various productions this year, the leadership had no idea how much money would be needed to realize these plans. It was also difficult to guarantee some urgently needed expenditures in current production. On the other hand, due to lax financial management, there were many instances of improper use of funds. In Guangfu Commune, from last autumn to before the Spring Festival, non-productive expenditures accounted for 50.1% of total expenditures. This situation is obviously unfavorable to the development of industrial and agricultural production.
    The Party committees of the three communes promptly discovered this problem and, with the help of the prefectural committee's working group, began to rectify financial work. Through accounting and sorting, it was found that the financial expenditure plan was very large, but the funds available to the commune after distribution were far less than this amount. At the same time, it was found that non-productive expenditures accounted for a large proportion of the expenditure items of the three communes.
    Were the commune's funds really insufficient to cover expenses? Could we find ways to expand fund accumulation through self-reliance? The commune's Party committee seized this issue and, after mass debate, tapped huge potential from both increasing income and reducing unnecessary expenditures.
    1. Distinguish between the importance and urgency of tasks, and under the premise of ensuring the needs of production funds and the rational use of funds, postpone those that can be postponed and use less for those that can be used less; for all expenditures, accurately calculate costs and reasonably save expenditures. The three communes could reduce expenditures by 948,000 yuan after postponing, saving, and accurately calculating expenses.
    2. Vigorously promote replacing old with new, waste utilization, and tap the potential of materials and funds to reduce cash expenditures. Huangdai and Weiting communes alone can tap 400,000 yuan in this area.
    3. Develop diversified economy, open up financial resources, and expand fund accumulation. In addition, the masses also proposed methods such as organizing deposits and expanding credit loans.
    After actively tapping potential, the three communes not only do not lack the funds needed before the summer harvest, but also have a surplus of 250,000 yuan.
    This meticulous accounting and sorting, which fully estimates the factors of both people and materials, not only enabled the leadership to initially understand the financial situation, but also actively opened up financial resources, eliminated waste, and provided a reliable guarantee for balancing revenue and expenditure.

    开源节流　勤俭办社
    吴县光福等公社生产资金由不足变有余
    本报讯　江苏吴县光福、黄埭和唯亭三个人民公社，在摸清家底的基础上，积极开辟财源，平衡收支规划，使公社的每一笔资金都能有计划地用在刀口子上，这对保证今年农业生产更大跃进起了积极的推动作用。
    开始，三个公社对今年发展各项生产虽已有了大体的规划，但对实现这些规划究竟需要多少钱，领导上却心中无数。对当前生产上某些迫切需要的开支也很难保证。可是另一方面，因财务管理不严，又出现了许多资金用之不当的现象。光福公社从去年秋收到春节前，非生产性开支竟占总支出的50.1％。这种情况对发展工农业生产显然是不利的。
    三个公社的党委及时发现了这个问题，在地委工作组帮助下，着手整顿财务工作。通过排队算账，发现财务支出的规划很大，但公社分配后可用资金却远远不足此数；同时又发现三个公社的支出项目中，非生产性开支占很大比重。
    公社的资金真是入不敷出吗？能不能设法自力更生地扩大资金积累呢？公社党委抓住这个问题，经过群众鸣放辩论，从增加收入和减少不必要开支这两个方面挖掘出了巨大的潜力。
    一、分别轻重缓急，在保证生产资金需要和合理使用资金的前提下，能缓办的就缓办，可以少用的就少用；对各项支出要做到精确核算成本，合理节约支出。三个公社可以缓办、节约和精确核算后可减少的支出就达九十四万八千元。
    二、大搞以旧代新，废物利用，挖掘物资和资金潜力，减少现金支出。这方面黄埭和唯亭两个公社就可挖掘出四十万元。
    三、发展多种经济，开辟财源，扩大资金积累。此外，群众还提出了组织存款，扩大信用贷金等办法。
    经过积极挖掘潜力后，三个公社在夏熟前所需要的资金不但不缺，而且还可多余二十五万元。
    这一次精细的排队和算账，把人与物的因素都充分估计进去，不仅使领导上初步摸清了家底，而且积极开辟了财源，杜绝了浪费，使收支平衡有了可靠的保证。（张竞）
