    Soil—The Foundation of Plant Growth
    Lu Feng
    Soil is the loose layer on the Earth's land surface where crops can grow. Crops can grow on soil because it has the ability to supply the necessary water and nutrients to crops during their various growth stages. This ability of the soil is called soil fertility. Farmers divide soil into infertile soil, active soil, and fertile soil according to the degree of fertility. This classification has profound production significance and is also very vivid. Infertile soil, also called raw soil, has tightly arranged soil particles, contains no or very little organic matter, and has very weak microbial activity. It basically still belongs to the scope of the soil's predecessor—the parent material, or it is an inactive soil, with no or very low fertility. Active soil is relatively loose, contains a certain amount of organic matter, and has active microbial activity and fertility. Fertile soil, also called mature soil, contains more organic matter than active soil, has high fertility, and can produce high yields when crops are planted.
    A long, long time ago, the Earth's surface was originally a hard rock, with no fertile soil like it is now, let alone flourishing plants. Over hundreds of millions of years, it has been continuously subjected to the sun's intense radiation, wind and rain, water erosion, cold and heat, biological (especially microbial) activity, etc. Through this series of physical, chemical, and biological effects, the hard rock has gradually become pulverized and loose, and soil has slowly formed on the basis of the parent material, and fertility began to appear. Especially after human cultivation, the soil has gained higher fertility. Therefore, soil and its fertility are not only the product of natural forces, but also the product of human labor. Like all things, soil and its fertility are constantly changing and developing according to certain laws. This process is not only affected by natural factors, but more importantly, by human activities. After people have mastered the laws of soil development, they can use artificial methods to change the soil in the direction people expect, in the direction of fertility, turning infertile soil into active soil, and active soil into fertile soil. This process is the process of soil ripening. Deep plowing is an effective means to promote soil ripening.
    Soil includes the following components: mineral particles of various sizes, organic and inorganic nutrients in various forms, various organisms, especially microorganisms and their activity products—humus, and finally water and air. All these components and their interrelationships affect the properties of the soil and the degree of soil fertility. Therefore, we cannot understand soil as simply the sum of mineral particles. To change the properties of the soil and regulate soil fertility, it is necessary to regulate the interrelationships of the various components in the soil.
    The growth and development of plants require the soil to simultaneously supply the required nutrients and water. However, plants cannot directly absorb and utilize organic nutrients and insoluble mineral nutrients in the soil. They must be converted into soluble, oxidized inorganic salts through microbial decomposition or oxidation before they can be absorbed and utilized by plants. And these processes must have the participation of air. Therefore, there must be a certain amount of space in the soil to provide a "place" for water and nutrients. As mentioned earlier, plant growth requires the soil to simultaneously supply the required nutrients and water, and to achieve this, water and air must coexist in the soil. However, water and air repel each other in the same space. Only soil with a good structure can solve this contradiction and allow water and air to coexist. Soil with a crumb structure is such a soil.
    What is crumb structure? It is the structure in which mineral particles in the soil are combined with each other to form aggregates with a diameter of 1-10 millimeters. Soil with this structure is called soil with crumb structure. Soil with crumb structure has two types of pores: capillary pores formed by the relatively tight arrangement of mineral particles inside the aggregates, and larger non-capillary pores between the aggregates. When it rains, water quickly infiltrates along the non-capillary pores, and each aggregate is also filled with water from the infiltrating water flow due to the action of capillaries, thus maximizing the reception of rainwater. When it is sunny and there is no rain, the surface of the soil dries out after a thin layer of soil has been dried by the sun due to the presence of non-capillary pores, becoming like a quilt, covering the deep layer and greatly reducing the loss of water from evaporation from the ground surface. Therefore, soil with crumb structure can both store water and conserve water. On the contrary, non-crumb structure soil has mineral particles that are not agglomerated into one piece, and the soil is full of capillary pores. Therefore, when it rains, water moves downwards very slowly, and much of the water forms surface runoff and is lost. When it is sunny and there is no rain, the water in the lower layer continuously rises to the surface due to the action of capillaries and evaporates in large quantities. Therefore, the water storage and water conservation capacity of non-crumb structure soil is very poor. From the perspective of nutrients, the inside of the aggregates of soil with crumb structure is full of water. As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement: "The aggregate itself is a small reservoir, and the space between the aggregates forms a corridor of air. This is conducive to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and the aggregate becomes a small fertilizer reservoir." Soil with crumb structure can solve the contradiction between water and air in the soil, and thus can simultaneously supply the water and nutrients needed for plant growth. Therefore, crumb structure is the foundation of soil fertility. Deep plowing is the most fundamental measure to form soil crumb structure.

    土—植物生长的基础
    鲁峰
    土壤是地球陆地表面能生长庄稼的疏松层。土壤上能够生长庄稼是因为有这样一种能力：在作物的各个生长期中供给作物所需的水分和养分。土壤的这种能力叫土壤肥力。农民根据肥力的程度，把土壤分为死土、活土和油土。这种分法有深刻的生产意义，也非常形象化。死土又叫生土，土粒排列紧密，不含或者很少含有机质，微生物活动非常微弱。它基本上还属于土壤的前身——母质的范围，或者是不活跃的土壤，不具有肥力或者肥力非常低。活土则比较疏松，含有一定的有机质，微生物的活动活跃，具有肥力。油土又叫熟土，比活土含有更多的有机质，肥力很高，种植庄稼可以获得很高的产量。
    很古很古的时候，地球表面原是一片坚硬的岩石，并没有现在这样肥沃的土壤，更没有繁盛的植物。亿万年来，它不断受到烈日的照射，风雨的吹打，水流的浸蚀，冷热的作用，生物（特别是微生物）的活动等等，通过这一系列物理的、化学的及生物的作用，才使坚硬的岩石逐渐变得粉碎、疏松，在母质的基础上慢慢形成了土壤，开始有了肥力。特别是经过人类的耕种以后，才使土壤有了较高的肥力。所以说，土壤和它的肥力不仅是自然作用的产物，而且也是人类劳动的产物。和一切事物一样，土壤和它的肥力也是遵循着一定的规律不断地变化和发展的。这个过程不仅受自然因素的影响，而更重要的是受着人类活动的影响。人们在掌握了土壤的发展规律以后，就可以用人为的方法使土壤向人们所期望的方向变化，向肥沃的方向变化，使死土变活土，活土变油土。这个过程，就是土壤熟化的过程。深耕就是促使土壤熟化的有效手段。
    土壤包括以下各种成分：各种大小不同的矿物粒子，各种不同形态的有机的和无机的养料，各种不同的生物，特别是微生物及其活动的产物——腐植质，最后还有水和空气。所有这些成分以及它们之间的相互关系，都影响着土壤的性质和土壤肥力的程度。所以，我们不能把土壤理解为只是矿物粒子的简单总和。人们要改变土壤的性质，调节土壤的肥力，就是要调节土壤中各种成分的相互关系。
    植物的生长和发育，要求土壤同时地供给所需的养分和水分。但是，植物不能直接吸收利用土壤中的有机养料和不溶性的矿物养料，它们必须经过微生物的分解或氧化作用以后，变为可溶性的氧化状态的无机盐类，才能被植物吸收利用。而这些过程，都必须有空气的参加。所以，土壤中必须要有一定的空隙，要给水分和养分以“存身之地”。前边已经说过，植物的生长要求土壤同时地供给所需的养分和水分，而要达到这一点，就必须要土壤中水分和空气同时存在。但是，在同一空间水分和空气是互相排斥的，只有具有良好结构的土壤才能解决这个矛盾，才能使水分和空气同时并存。有团粒结构的土壤，就是这样的土壤。
    什么是团粒结构呢？就是土壤中的矿物粒子互相结合成一个个直径为一—十毫米大的团块的结构。具有这种结构的土壤叫有团粒结构的土壤。有团粒结构的土壤有两种空隙：团粒内部由于矿物粒子的较紧密的排列而形成的毛细管空隙，团粒之间的较大的非毛细管空隙。当有雨水时，水分沿非毛细管空隙迅速下渗，每个团粒也因毛细管的作用而由下渗水流中吸满了水分，这样就能最大限度地接纳雨水。当天晴无雨时，因有非毛细管空隙的存在，表面一薄层土壤被晒干以后，就变成像一块被子一样，复盖着深层，大大减少了水分由地表的蒸发损失。所以有团粒结构的土壤既能蓄水，又能保水。相反，非团粒结构的土壤，它的矿物粒子是不成团的一片，土中全是毛细管空隙，因而当有雨水时，水向下运动很慢，许多水分都形成了地面径流而损失。在天晴无雨时，又因毛细管的作用而使下层水分不断上升至表面，大量蒸发。所以，非团粒结构的土壤的蓄水和保水能力都很差。再从养分方面来看，有团粒结构的土壤团粒内部充满着水分。正如中共中央关于深耕和改良土壤的指示所指出的：“团粒本身是个小水库，团粒之间的空隙则形成空气的走廊。这就有利于土壤中有机物质的分解，团粒也就成了小肥料库”。有团粒结构的土壤能解决土壤中水分和空气的矛盾，从而能同时供给植物生长所需的水分和养分。所以说，团粒结构是土壤肥力的基础。深耕则是形成土壤团粒结构的最根本的措施。
