Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th – President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delivered a speech at a special session of the Indonesian Parliament today.

President Ho Chi Minh praised the unity of the Indonesian people, their struggle against colonialism for national independence, and their achievements. He said that the Vietnamese people fully support the Indonesian people's aspiration and determination to recover West Irian. The Vietnamese people are confident that all patriotic forces in Indonesia will surely be able to defeat the colonialists and recover West Irian.

Speaking of the Vietnamese people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland, President Ho Chi Minh condemned the imperialists for disrespecting the Geneva Accords and hindering the realization of Vietnam's reunification. He pointed out that the imperialists are continuing to interfere in South Vietnam, turning it into a military base for preparing new wars. He said, we firmly believe that the solidarity and resolute struggle of the entire Vietnamese people, with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely lead the cause of the Vietnamese people for the reunification of their motherland to victory.

President Ho Chi Minh then said that the history of Vietnam and Indonesia proves that national unity is the decisive factor for success. The close unity of Asian countries is an important factor in defeating colonialism and imperialism. He said that since the Bandung Conference, this unity has been strengthened and is developing day by day.

President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that at present, the world situation has undergone fundamental changes: the forces of war have suffered a series of defeats; while the forces of peace, democracy and national independence are growing stronger. He said, therefore, we firmly believe that the power of unity and struggle of the Asian and African peoples will surely defeat colonialism and imperialism.

The members of Parliament broke the convention of not applauding in Parliament today, and repeatedly gave warm applause to President Ho Chi Minh's speech.

Before President Ho Chi Minh delivered his speech, Parliamentary Speaker Sartono introduced President Ho Chi Minh's brilliant experiences.

Sartono pointed out that the histories of Vietnam and Indonesia and their struggles against colonialism have many similarities. He said that President Ho Chi Minh's visit will surely strengthen the friendly ties and cooperation between the Indonesian and Vietnamese peoples. He expressed the hope that Vietnam would achieve reunification at an early date.

Also present at today's special session of Parliament were Prime Minister Djuanda and cabinet ministers, as well as diplomatic envoys from China, the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, and other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th – Indonesian President Sukarno said at a state banquet held for President Ho Chi Minh tonight that President Ho Chi Minh's visit to Indonesia will help to further strengthen the friendship and relations between Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

President Sukarno expressed his acceptance of President Ho Chi Minh's invitation to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said, "I will go to Vietnam to further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between your country and my country." President Sukarno concluded by proposing a toast to President Ho Chi Minh's health and the prosperity and happiness of the Vietnamese people.

President Ho Chi Minh said at the banquet that both Vietnam and Indonesia had suffered the pain of imperialist rule, and later got rid of imperialism and gained freedom and independence. He pointed out that, however, Indonesia still has to recover West Irian, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has to strive to restore the unity of the country. He said that therefore, both countries still have to fight against imperialism.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the Vietnamese people did not have warships, airplanes, and tanks in the patriotic war against French imperialists, "but like you, we beat them very badly, because like your people, our people are patriotic and want freedom."

President Ho Chi Minh said that thanks to the Bandung spirit, the people of many Asian and African countries have gained freedom.
