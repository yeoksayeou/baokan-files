    Joyfully Listening to Kugik's Singing
    Guo Naian
    The visit and performance in Beijing by Soviet People's Artist, the famous Estonian baritone, Tiit Kuusik, has given us the opportunity to appreciate the outstanding singing of this gifted singer, which is truly exciting!
    This singer, known for his beautiful voice, has given us a very deep impression. His voice is a clever combination of passion and mellowness, a clever combination of the depth of emotional experience and the clarity of the image; his use of vocal contrast can be described as a perfect blend of strength and softness, and it is just right. With highly perfect vocal skills and versatile talent, he truthfully expresses the artistic content of his program.
    We all greatly appreciate Tiit Kuusik's performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Not the Wind Blowing from the Heights." When singing this famous lyrical piece, he handled it entirely with soft, gentle tones. In this program, we were amazed not only by his high level of technical control when singing in soft tones, but more importantly, we were led by him into the wonderful spiritual realm of the work. However, the Rimsky-Korsakov lyrical piece "By the Sea," which he sang next, was a completely different realm. Here, it is full of unrestrained passion, which forms a strong contrast with "Not the Wind Blowing from the Heights."
    Tiit Kuusik brilliantly interpreted the German composer Schumann's songs "I Bear No Grudge" and "The Two Grenadiers." In "I Bear No Grudge," he used a mellow and firm voice to express deep emotional experience without any exaggeration. In "The Two Grenadiers," he not only expressed the richness of emotion, but also highlighted the heroic climax in the latter part. The entire piece was handled so richly, completely, and movingly.
    The two Estonian folk songs sung by the singer gave us a vivid and intimate feeling for the life customs of the Estonian people. Also, the performances of Estonian composer A. Kapp's lyrical song "Along the Forest Path" and E. Kapp's lyrical song "Summons," one is a deep and distant poetic feeling, and the other is a passionate summons, both are expressed so appropriately. Through the performance of these programs, we have greatly increased our understanding of the Estonian people.
    As a seasoned opera actor, Tiit Kuusik has versatile talents in playing opera roles. Moreover, no matter what kind of work he sings, he does not have the excessive exaggeration and pursuit of superficial effects that often appear on the opera stage. His singing is always good at revealing the spiritual characteristics of the characters in the play, and expressing them through perfect and vivid techniques.
    He sings Figaro's aria and lyrical piece from Mozart's opera "The Marriage of Figaro," relaxed without becoming frivolous, accurately and vividly expressing Figaro's wit, cheerfulness, and optimism. When he sings Mephistopheles' Serenade from Gounod's opera "Faust," those contemptuous laughs are a profound expression of rebellious spirit, not at all excessive.
    Similarly, when he sings the "Toreador Song" from Bizet's opera "Carmen," the high-spirited singing not only shows his perfect technique, but more importantly, it is a unified expression of artistic truthfulness and the vividness and completeness of the image in his artistic creation.
    For such an outstanding singer, his artistic achievements are far beyond what I can summarize in this short article. His visit and performance have given us a lot of enlightenment.

    喜听库吉克的演唱
    郭乃安
    苏联人民演员、爱沙尼亚著名男中音歌唱家齐特·库吉克在北京的访问演出，使我们有机会欣赏到这位天才歌唱家的卓越的演唱，实在令人兴奋！
    这位以优美的歌喉著称的歌唱家，给了我们极为深刻的印象。他的声音是热情和圆润的巧妙结合，是感情体验的深刻性和形象的明朗性的巧妙结合；他对声音对比的运用真可谓刚柔相济，恰到好处。他以高度完善的声乐技巧和多方面的才能，真实地表现了他的节目的艺术内容。
    我们都十分赞赏齐特·库吉克演唱的李姆斯基—科萨可夫的“不是高处吹来的风”，他唱这首著名的抒情曲时，全部是用轻柔的弱音来处理的。在这个节目中，我们惊叹的不仅是他演唱弱音时高度的技巧控制，更主要的是我们被他引进了作品的美妙的精神境界。但是，他接着又唱的李姆斯基—科萨可夫的抒情曲“海边”，却是另一种决然不同的境界。这里充满着不可抑止的热情，恰恰同“不是高处吹来的风”构成强烈的对比。
    齐特·库吉克卓越地解释了德国作曲家舒曼的歌曲
  “我不怨恨”和“两个掷弹兵”。在“我不怨恨”这一节目中，他用圆润而又坚实的声音，毫无夸饰地表达了深刻的感情体验。在“两个掷弹兵”中，不仅表达了感情的丰富性，并在后部突现了英雄性的高潮。整个曲子处理得那么丰富、完整而且动人。
    歌唱家演唱的两首爱沙尼亚民歌，使我们对爱沙尼亚人民的生活习俗有了栩栩如生的亲切感受。还有爱沙尼亚作曲家阿·卡普的抒情曲“沿着林间小径”和爱·卡普的抒情曲“召唤”的演唱，一个是深邃幽远的诗情，一个是热情的召唤，表现的都是那么恰到好处。通过这些节目的表演，使我们大大地增加了对爱沙尼亚人民的了解。
    作为久经舞台锻炼的歌剧演员的齐特·库吉克，在歌剧角色的扮演上有着多方面的才能。而且，他无论演唱那一类的作品，都没有那种常常出现在歌剧舞台上的过火的夸张和追求表面效果的作风。他的演唱总是善于揭示剧中人物性格的精神特征，并且通过完善的、形象鲜明的手法表现出来。
    他唱莫扎特的歌剧“费加罗的婚礼”中的费加罗的咏叹调和抒情曲，轻松而不流于轻薄，确切而生动地表现了费加罗的机智、开朗和乐观的性格。他唱古诺的歌剧“浮士德”中梅菲斯托斐尔的小夜曲时，那些轻蔑的笑声，正是叛逆精神的深刻的表现，一点也不过火。
    同样的，在他唱比才的歌剧“卡门”的“斗牛士之歌”时，那昂扬的歌声，不仅表现了他的完善的技巧，而且更主要的是他在艺术创造上对于艺术的真实性和形象的鲜明性和完整性的统一的表现。
    对于这样一位卓越的歌唱家，他的艺术成就远不是我这篇短文所能概括的。他的访问演出使我们得到了不少的教益。
