Vietnamese Overseas Chinese in Thailand Demonstrate Against Persecution by Authorities

Bangkok Dispatch: According to Bangkok newspapers, more than 500 Vietnamese overseas Chinese in Lang Khai Province, northeastern Thailand, gathered on the 6th around the police station of the province to protest the arrest of three Vietnamese overseas Chinese and the authorities' coercion of Vietnamese overseas Chinese to provide fingerprints.

Recently, Vietnamese overseas Chinese in Mokken Province and Sakon Nakhon Province have been going to local police stations for several days in a row to protest the authorities' plan to concentrate them in southern Thailand and demand the release of their arrested relatives.

American Small Space Rocket Loses Scientific Value

Washington Dispatch: The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced on the 12th that a small space rocket launched by the United States not long ago has completely lost its scientific value and will no longer be visible to people in the future. It is said that it will take fifteen years before it can approach the Earth at the shortest distance, and at that time the distance between the two will be more than ten million miles. It will be impossible to observe it with any instrument. Therefore, it will not be possible to use it to accurately determine the astronomical unit, that is, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. This astronomical unit is very important for future spaceflight.

    美国小宇宙火箭失去科学价值
    华盛顿讯：美国全国星际和空间航行局12日宣布，美国不久前发射的一个小宇宙火箭已经完全失去了科学价值，以后不可能再被人们看到。据说，要等到十五年以后，它才能以最短的距离接近地球，而那时两者之间将相距一千万英里以上。人们用任何仪器都无法对它进行观测。因此也就不可能利用它来精密地确定天文单位，即地球与太阳之间的平均距离。而这个天文单位对于将来的宇宙飞行是非常重要的。
