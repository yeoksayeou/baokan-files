Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 4th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has over a thousand large and small dairy factories, plans to further develop the dairy industry this year by using old factories to lead new factories and large factories to lead small factories, without or with minimal investment. This will enable the output of milk powder, cream, casein, lactose, condensed milk, buttermilk powder, and other products to double.

Currently, the dairy industry sector in Inner Mongolia is carrying out a mass movement centered on technological revolution to achieve this leap forward plan. Many dairy factories have also self-made indigenous equipment and have developed from single production to joint enterprises, expanding the utilization of raw materials.

In the mass technological revolution movement, the finished product rate and product quality of various dairy factories have been improved. The rate of first-grade products leaving the factory at the Yakshih Milk Powder Factory has recently jumped from 35% to over 98%.

    据新华社呼和浩特4日电　拥有一千多个大、小乳品工厂的内蒙古自治区，今年计划用老厂带新厂，大厂带小厂等办法，在不投资或少投资的情况下，进一步发展乳品工业，使乳粉、奶油、酪胶、乳糖、炼乳、酪乳乳粉等的产量成倍增长。
    目前，内蒙古的乳品工业部门正在开展一个以技术革命为中心的群众运动，来实现这个跃进计划。许多乳品工厂还自制土设备，已由单一生产发展成为联合企业，扩大了原材料的利用。
    在群众性的技术革命运动中，各个乳品工厂的成品率和产品质量都有了提高。牙克石乳粉厂出厂的一级品率，最近已由35％跃到98％以上。
