Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th—The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued its session on the afternoon of the 16th.

　　Sambrowski, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, first made a report on the revision of the Party Constitution at the meeting.

　　The reporter pointed out that the revision of the Party Constitution is to fully comply with the principles of Leninism and to make the provisions in the Party Constitution fully consistent with the Party's actions. The Party Constitution should be regarded as an inviolable law.

　　He said that after the Eighth Plenary Session, the Party restored its ties with the masses and, on this basis, consolidated the Party's leading role in the entire national life, overcoming the reactionary forces, especially the revisionist theories that are particularly dangerous to the Party's activities. Now, the domestic political situation is stable, the Party is united, and the political enthusiasm of party members has also been strengthened.

　　The reporter particularly emphasized the issue of democratic centralism. He said that democratic centralism has great practical and political significance. It is the main principle of inner-Party life and a condition for the Party's ideological and political unity and consistency of action. He also said that small groups and factional activities must never be allowed to use it to undermine the Party's unity. He said that only under the condition of the Party's unity can inner-Party democracy be correctly and consistently promoted.

　　Sambrowski then talked about the activities of the Party's grassroots organizations. He said that the revisionists proposed to separate the Party organizations from economic and production issues, and this theory is extremely harmful. Political work should be combined with production activities. Party organizations should be concerned about economic issues.

　　After Sambrowski's report, Podalski, First Secretary of the Koszalin Provincial Committee, then spoke. He talked about the great achievements in the construction of Koszalin Province in the past and the moving prospects for future development. He said that the total industrial output value of Koszalin Province will double in seven years. The grain yield per hectare will increase by three quintals, and milk production will increase by 45%.

　　Wolczyk, First Secretary of the Warsaw Old Town District Committee, said that the Party's unity is the result of the Party's correct line.

　　Kiesielewski, Secretary of the Szczecin Provincial Committee, said in his speech that the Party's policies are not only supported by the Szczecin Provincial Party Organization, but also by the broad masses united around the Party.

　　Bagdash, General Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party, spoke about the situation in the Near and Middle East when he extended congratulations to the conference.

　　Then, Jackson, National Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, extended congratulations to the conference. He said that Poland's achievements in socialist construction have greatly encouraged the American working people.

　　When talking about Poland's fight against revisionism, Jackson said that this fight is in line with the interests of the Polish people and is also a contribution to the socialist camp.

　　Bagdash and Jackson's speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants.

　　The afternoon session on the 16th ended here, and the meeting will continue on the 17th.

    萨姆布罗夫斯基作修改党章报告
    叙共、美共代表向大会致贺词
    新华社华沙16日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会16日下午继续开会。
    统一工人党中央政治局委员萨姆布罗夫斯基在会上首先作了关于修改党章的报告。
    报告人指出，修改党章是为了完全遵守列宁主义原则，使党章中的规定与党的行动完全一致。应该把党章视为不可破坏的法律。
    他说，在八中全会后，党恢复了与群众的联系，并在这个基础上巩固党在整个国家生活中的领导作用，战胜了反动力量、特别是对党的活动格外危险的修正主义理论。现在，国内政治形势是稳定的，党内是团结的，党员的政治积极性也加强了。
    报告人特别着重谈到了民主集中制问题。他说，民主集中制具有很大的实践意义和政治意义。它是党内生活的主要原则，是党在思想上和政治上的团结和行动一致的条件。他又说，绝不容许小集团和派别活动利用它来破坏党的团结。他说，只有在党团结一致的条件下，才能正确地和一贯地发扬党内民主。
    萨姆布罗夫斯基接着谈到了党的基层组织的活动问题。他说，修正主义者提出要使党组织脱离经济问题和生产问题，这种理论是极为有害的。应该使政治工作同生产活动结合起来。党组织应该关心经济问题。
    在萨姆布罗夫斯基报告后，柯萨林省委员会第一书记波达尔斯基接着发言。他谈到了柯萨林省过去建设中的巨大成就和今后发展的动人远景。他说，柯萨林省工业生产总值七年间要增加一倍。每公顷土地上的谷物产量要增加三公担，牛奶要增产45％。
    华沙老城区委员会第一书记伏耳契克说，党的团结是党的正确路线的结果。
    什切青省委员会书记基谢累夫斯基在发言中说，党的政策不仅得到什切青省党组织的支持，而且也得到了团结在党周围的广大群众的支持。
    叙利亚共产党总书记巴格达什在向大会上致祝词时谈到了中近东情况。
  接着美国共产党全国书记杰克逊向大会致祝词。他说，波兰在社会主义建设中的成就大大鼓舞了美国劳动人民。
    杰克逊在谈到波兰对修正主义的反击时说，这一反击是与波兰人民的利益一致的，同时也是对社会主义阵营的贡献。
    巴格达什和杰克逊的讲话受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    16日下午会议至此结束，17日继续开会。
