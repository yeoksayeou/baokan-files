    Spring Night Jottings
    Mulin
    The early spring weather in Jiangnan is rainy.
    It rained for more than twenty consecutive days, and the blue sky had just appeared when it started raining again. The room is quite cold at night, but the two packages on the desk are like two stoves, making me feel warm…
    One package, wrapped in yellow kraft paper, contains "Geranium" medicine, recently sent from Jinan, Shandong, to treat arthritis. I have suffered from arthritis for five or six years, and have taken many Chinese and Western medicines over the years, but it has never been cured. Not long ago, I saw a secret ancestral recipe of a famous doctor from Hebei published in a medical journal, and I rushed to the pharmacy to get it, but the main medicine, "Geranium," could not be found anywhere in the city. After checking the pharmacopoeia, I learned that it was originally produced in Shandong, but I didn't know which pharmacy in Shandong had it, so I wrote to the Jinan Dazhong Daily asking for their help. Today, half a month later, I actually received this package of medicine that came from nearly two thousand miles away.
    What is particularly touching is that the clerk of Jinan Hongjitang, who sent the medicine, also gave me a letter, which said:
      "Your letter was forwarded to our store by the Shandong Dazhong Daily through the Chinese medicine wholesale department. We believe that Geranium is effective in treating arthritis, and we believe that with this secret recipe, you will definitely recover and work hard for the socialist construction of the motherland. …”
    Who can say that this is just an ordinary relationship between a store clerk and a customer? For one person's illness, how many people are deeply concerned!
    The other package is the draft of the big-character poster given to me by the group leader in the school. The group leader said kindly: "This is a gift from the students to you during the airing of views and debate stage. They may not all be correct. But even if there is only 5% correctness, we hope you will absorb it, with the aim of improving understanding and improving work..." I opened the package and read it from beginning to end, the voices and smiles of the students seemed to be right in front of me:
    "Teacher: When you teach, sometimes you beautify the lifestyles of hermits in the feudal era without criticizing them, which has a bad influence on us... See how harmful this is!"
    "Teacher, we hope you progress, just like a child hopes their mother is healthy!"
  People are not made of wood or stone. Who can remain indifferent after reading these earnest words? A person who has received a bourgeois education has been infected with many viruses. If these problems are not cured in time, teachers will directly infect the younger generation. The Party's rectification movement has indeed played a role in curing diseases and saving people. Thinking about the responsibilities I should bear in teaching, I feel both ashamed and excited!
    The accidental coincidence of the two packages gave me a complete concept, and also deepened this concept: how close is the relationship between people in the new society! When you are sick, people you have never met thousands of miles away will know about it, comfort you, encourage you, and serve you! When you make a mistake, comrades will warmly advise you, help you, and urge you to progress. Whether it is people you know or people you don't know, they all hope you are healthy in body and mind, and serve the people better. This is unimaginable in the cold and ruthless old society. All this is so inspiring!
    Spring is a season when all things are full of life. This year's spring is another spring for the whole people to strive for greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward. Then, let me write this short article to commemorate this extraordinary spring!

    春夜随笔
    木林
    江南的早春天气是多雨的。
    一连下了二十多天的雨，刚刚露出蓝天。桃花还没来得及开放，又下起雨来了。夜里室内相当冷，但是，案头两个包裹却像两盆火，使我感到热呼呼地……
    一包用黄色牛皮纸包着的“老鹳草”，是刚从山东济南寄来的治关节炎的中药。我患关节炎已经五六年了，几年来服过不少中西药物，总是治不好。不久前看到医刊上公开的河北名医的一个祖传秘方，我就连忙到药店里去配，可是其中主药“老鹳草”全城都找不到，查了一下药典才知道原产山东，可是又不知道山东什么地方什么药房有，于是就写信给济南大众日报请他们帮忙。半个月以后的今天，居然收到了这包不远两千里而来的药。
    尤其可感的是寄药的济南宏济堂的店员同志还给了我一封信，信上说：
      “您的来信，是山东大众日报转到中药批发部介绍到我店的。老鹳草治关节炎，我们相信定有奇效，我们相信您有此秘方，一定能痊愈，为祖国社会主义建设而努力。……”
    谁能说这是一般的店员与顾客的关系呢？为了一个人的疾病，多少人在深切的关怀！
    另一包是学校里的小组长交给我的大字报底稿。小组长亲切地说：“这是同学们在鸣放争辩阶段送给你的礼物，不一定都正确。但即使只有5％的正确性，也希望加以吸收，目的在提高认识，改进工作……”我打开纸包从头到尾看了一遍，同学们的声音、笑貌，就像在我眼前：
    “老师：您教课时，有时候美化了封建时代隐士们的生活方式，而没有对他们进行批判，对我们起了不好的影响……您看这危害性有多大！”
    “老师，我们希望您进步，就像孩子希望母亲健康！”
  人非草木，看了这些热切的语言，谁能无动于衷呢？一个受过资产阶级教育的人，染上的病毒是不少的，毛病如不及时治好，做教师的就会直接传染给年轻一代，党的整风运动，的的确确起了治病救人的作用。想想自己在教学中应该负的责任，真是又惭愧又兴奋！
    两个包裹偶然的巧合，使我得出一个完整的概念，也加深了这个概念：新社会人与人之间的关系是多么亲密啊！当你患了疾病，数千里外素不相识的人知道了，也会安慰你鼓励你，为你效劳！当你犯了错误，同志们会热情地劝导你，帮助你，促使你进步。不论是你认识的或不认识的人，都希望你身心健康，更好地为人民服务，这是在冷酷无情的旧社会所不能想像的，这一切多么令人振奋！
    春天是万物生机蓬勃的季节。今年的春天，又是全民争取更大更好更全面跃进的春天。那末，就让我写下这篇短文来纪念这个不平凡的春天吧！
