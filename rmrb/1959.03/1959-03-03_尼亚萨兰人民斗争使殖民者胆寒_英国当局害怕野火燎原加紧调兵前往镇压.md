Xinhua News Agency dispatches: A dispatch from Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanganyika: Colonial police from Tanganyika, a British "trusteeship" in East Africa, crossed the border on March 1st and entered northern Nyasaland to suppress the people of Nyasaland.

These police have already occupied Hillborough. An airport in Hillborough has been controlled by Africans since the riots in Nyasaland.

An official statement from the British colonial authorities said that the colonial police of Tanganyika entered Nyasaland at the request of the Governor of Nyasaland.

According to reports from Blantyre, the anti-colonial struggle of the Africans in Nyasaland continues. The Nyasaland African National Congress held two mass rallies in the northern province of Nyasaland on the afternoon of February 28, one in Mzuzu and the other in Rumphi.

The report said that while the mass rally in Mzuzu was in progress, the police sent by the British colonial authorities to suppress the demonstration used tear gas again and arrested eighteen Africans.

At the same time, according to reports from Lourenço Marques, the capital of Mozambique, the Portuguese colonial authorities also sent troops to the area bordering Nyasaland on the evening of March 1.

In recent days, the struggle of the people of Nyasaland in Central Africa against British colonial rule has reached a climax. In many areas of Nyasaland, people have continuously held large-scale demonstrations and parades to protest against Britain's persecution of African leaders who are leading the struggle for independence, and demanding immediate secession from the "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland" and complete independence.

Since the beginning of the year, the people's demonstration movement in Nyasaland has been unfolding continuously. British newspapers admit that in the past few weeks, there have been demonstrations and clashes with the police almost every day. Now, the anti-colonial anger in Nyasaland is tending to spread to Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the situation in the region is approaching a "boiling point."

The colonial imperialists are terrified because the struggle in Nyasaland is like a prairie fire. These days, British newspapers are worried that the wave of opposition to colonial rule by the people of Nyasaland will sweep across Northern and Southern Rhodesia, causing "the danger of a full-scale fire." The colonial authorities in the neighboring areas of the Central African Federation are extremely worried and "watching" the situation in Nyasaland, fearing a "chain reaction." (Attached picture)

    尼亚萨兰人民斗争使殖民者胆寒
    英国当局害怕野火燎原加紧调兵前往镇压
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：坦噶尼喀首府达累斯萨拉姆消息：英国“托管”下的东非坦噶尼喀的殖民警察在3月1日越过边境，开进尼亚萨兰北部，去镇压尼亚萨兰人民。
    这些警察已经占据了希尔堡。希尔堡的一个机场自尼亚萨兰发生暴动后就一直由非洲人掌握着。
    英殖民当局的一项官方声明说，坦噶尼喀的殖民警察是应尼亚萨兰总督的要求开进尼亚萨兰的。
    据布兰太尔消息，尼亚萨兰非洲人反殖民主义的斗争仍在继续中。非洲人国民大会2月28日下午曾在尼亚萨兰北部省份举行了两次群众性示威集会，一次在姆苏苏，另一次是在鲁姆皮。
    消息说，在姆苏苏的群众集会正在举行的时候，英殖民当局派往镇压的警察又使用了催泪弹，并逮捕了十八个非洲人。
    同时，据来自莫三鼻给首府罗伦索马贵斯的消息说，葡萄牙殖民当局在3月1日晚间也派遣军队前往这个殖民地同尼亚萨兰交界的地方。
    最近几天来，中非尼亚萨兰人民反对英国殖民统治的斗争进入高潮。尼亚萨兰许多地区的人民连续举行大规模示威游行，抗议英国迫害领导争取独立斗争的非洲人领袖，要求立即脱离“罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦”，取得完全的独立。
    自从开年以来，尼亚萨兰人民的示威运动就在不断展开。英国报纸承认，过去几个星期中，几乎每天都有游行示威、同警察发生冲突的事件。现在，尼亚萨兰反殖民主义的怒火已有扩大到南北罗得西亚的趋势，这一地区的局势正在接近
  “沸点”。
    殖民帝国主义者恐惧不安是因为尼亚萨兰的斗争正像野火燎原。这几天，英国报纸在担心尼亚萨兰人民反对殖民统治的浪潮会席卷南北罗得西亚，会引起“全面发生大火的危险”。中非联邦邻近地区的殖民当局都在极端忧虑地“注视着”尼亚萨兰的局势，害怕发生“连锁反应”。（附图片）
