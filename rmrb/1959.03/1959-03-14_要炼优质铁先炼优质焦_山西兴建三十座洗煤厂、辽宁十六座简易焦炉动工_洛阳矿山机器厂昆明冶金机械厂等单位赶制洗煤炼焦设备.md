(Our Newspaper) News: Shanxi Province is constructing thirty large, medium, and simple coal washing plants.

In the past, except for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's coking plant, which washed and selected coal for its own use, there were no coal washing plants in the entire province.

This year, Shanxi Province will begin construction on a total of six modern coal washing plants with a total annual coal washing capacity of eight million tons. The sites of these large and medium-sized coal washing plants are all in areas producing coking coal, with sufficient water and power supply, and convenient transportation. The Taiyuan Coal Washing Plant, which is being built, is designed and equipped by Poland, with an annual coal washing capacity of two million tons. Currently, the civil engineering of the four huge workshops for coal receiving, preparation, water washing, and loading is nearing completion, and various mechanical equipment is being installed. The plant building of the water washing workshop, which is twenty-nine meters high, has already been erected, and the third layer of hoppers and the pre-installation of the main washing machine are being rushed. Inside the loading warehouse for storing refined coal, disk feeders and vacuum filters are being installed. All construction and installation work will be completed in the third quarter of this year and officially put into production. The civil engineering of the Jiexiu Coal Washing Plant, with an annual coal washing capacity of 1.5 million tons, has been fully launched and is expected to be completed and put into production in the first quarter of next year. The construction preparations are being accelerated for the four modern coal washing plants planned to be newly built in Huoxian, Luan, and other coal mines this year.

Recently, in order to cooperate with the construction of simple coke ovens, it was decided to build twenty-one simple coal washing plants in state-owned and local coal mines that produce coking coal, with a total coal washing capacity of 7.2 million tons. Currently, the sites of eighteen simple coal washing plants have been determined, and construction designs are underway. The five coal washing plants in Xuangang, Xishan, and Fenxi, which are progressing faster, will start construction soon. In addition, of the three simple coal washing plants that started construction last year, one in Xuangang has been basically completed and has begun trial production, and the remaining two will also be completed and handed over for production this year.

It is estimated that the coal washing capacity of the coal washing plants put into production in the province this year will reach approximately 9.9 million tons. In this way, the weak coal washing capacity of Shanxi Province will undergo a fundamental change. In addition to meeting the province's own coking needs, it can also support the national steel production.

(Our Newspaper) News: In order to ensure the completion of this year's steel production leap forward plan, Liaoning Province has decided to build the first batch of sixty No. 2 simple coke ovens throughout the province. Sixteen of them have already started construction and will be put into production successively in March. After the first batch of sixty No. 2 simple coke ovens is completed and put into production, calculated at an annual output of 5,000 tons per furnace, more than 200,000 tons of coke can be produced in the next three quarters, which will play a significant role in ensuring steel production needs. Currently, relevant leading departments and cities and counties with furnace construction tasks in Liaoning Province are taking measures to accelerate the speed of furnace construction. For example, in terms of refractory material production, it has been decided to give priority to meeting the needs of No. 2 simple coke oven construction in addition to ensuring the completion of national tasks and supporting national tasks. Some units have also taken measures such as using ceramics instead of steel and using waste oil drums as pipelines to overcome the shortage of materials. In order to rush the construction of simple coke ovens, relevant machinery factories are fighting day and night, and have now rushed to produce sixty sets of coking equipment and sent them to the furnace construction units. In order to break through technical barriers and prepare technical forces for furnace construction, the province also opened two training classes in furnace building and production in February. A batch of technical forces trained in the furnace building training class have been dispatched to various construction units to participate in construction.

(Our Newspaper) News: The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory is undertaking the manufacturing tasks of a large number of washing and mining equipment this year. These equipment are manufactured for our country's large-scale steel and coal production bases, including equipment urgently needed by Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Fushun Coal Mine, and Pingdingshan and Hebi coal mines in Henan Province. Ten washing equipment are planned to be completed in March.

The employees of Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory attach great importance to the production of these products. After receiving the design drawings last month, many people began to review, modify, and compile material lists during the Spring Festival. Originally, these tasks would have taken twenty-two days to complete, but they were completed and delivered to the workshop in fourteen days. In order to ensure the completion of the national plan, the factory party committee established some necessary institutions and systems in response to this year's tasks, and compiled various measures and plans. The factory and workshop continuously conducted plan briefings to the workers, and organized technicians and workers to discuss the plan and study the drawings together. In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the factory organized its own manganese smelting and silicon smelting.

The metal structure workshop, which is responsible for the production of these products, is mobilizing workers to take all measures to complete the plan. The workers in this workshop are trying to modify the product design, reduce the workload, and reform jigs and tools. The work of manufacturing tools and equipment has already begun.

(Our Newspaper) News: Kunming Metallurgical Machinery Factory, Yunnan Mining Machinery Factory, and many other machinery factories are rushing to produce coal washing and simple coking equipment to accelerate the arming of the coal industry, so as to quickly refine high-quality coke.

At present, the vast number of employees in the mechanical factories and power manufacturing plants undertaking the manufacturing tasks of this batch of coal washing and coking equipment are stepping up manufacturing with high production enthusiasm. The Kunming Metallurgical Machinery Factory's production tasks for February were originally full, and the metallurgical equipment manufacturing tasks were very tight. However, because the employees understood that the manufacture of coal washing equipment was also a top priority, they resolutely stated that while completing the tasks of ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling equipment, they would strive to complete or complete the coking equipment manufacturing tasks ahead of schedule. In the case of tight time and urgent tasks, they tried every means to overcome difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and technical forces, and immediately began feeding and manufacturing. The Yunnan Mining Machinery Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing washing coal tumbler cage and manual gate, immediately held a meeting of the party committee to discuss and unify thinking after receiving the task, mobilized at the staff meeting, arranged the production schedule, and decided to complete the parts processing and all assembly tasks at the end of the month.

The Youth Leap Forward small coke oven designed and built by the employees of Benxi First Iron and Steel Plant is producing coke.

Since this small coke oven combining indigenous and foreign methods was put into production, the output has been increasing continuously, and now it has increased from 20 tons of coke per day to 25 tons. The highest reached 28 tons, and the coke quality is also close to the level of the large foreign furnace. An average of one ton of coal tar can be produced every day.

    要炼优质铁先炼优质焦
    山西兴建三十座洗煤厂、辽宁十六座简易焦炉动工
    洛阳矿山机器厂昆明冶金机械厂等单位赶制洗煤炼焦设备
    本报讯　山西省正在兴建三十座大、中型和简易洗煤厂。
    过去，山西省除太原钢铁公司焦化厂进行煤炭洗选自行使用外，全省还没有一座洗煤厂。
    今年山西省即将开工的现代化洗煤厂共有六座，年洗煤能力总计为八百万吨。这些大、中型洗煤厂的厂址，都在焦煤产地，水源、电源充足，交通方便。正在兴建中的太原洗煤厂是由波兰设计并提供设备的，全年洗煤能力为二百万吨。目前，这个洗煤厂的受煤、准备、水洗和装车四个规模巨大的车间土建工程已接近完工，各种机械设备正在安装。高达二十九公尺的水洗车间的厂房已经耸立起来，现在赶做第三层漏斗和预装主洗机。储存精煤的装车仓的内部正在安装圆盘给煤机和真空过滤机。全部建厂、安装工程将于今年第三季度结束，并正式投入生产。全年洗煤能力为一百五十万吨的介休洗煤厂的土建工程已经全面展开施工，预计将在明年第一季度全部建成并投入生产。今年计划在霍县、潞安等煤矿新建的四座现代化洗煤厂，正在加紧进行施工准备。
    最近，为了配合简易炼焦炉的兴建，又决定在盛产焦煤的各国营煤矿和地方煤矿新建简易洗煤厂二十一座，它们的洗煤能力总计为七百二十万吨。目前有十八座简易洗煤厂的厂址业已确定，正在进行施工设计，进展速度较快的轩岗、西山、汾西三地的五座洗煤厂，将于最近破土动工。此外，去年开工兴建的三座简易洗煤厂，除轩岗的一座已基本建成并开始试验性生产外，其余两座也将在今年竣工移交生产。
    预计全省今年投入生产的洗煤厂的洗煤能力将达九百九十万吨左右。这样山西省洗煤能力薄弱的状况将发生根本变化，除了满足本省炼焦需要外，还可支援全国钢铁生产。
    本报讯　辽宁省为保证今年钢铁生产跃进计划的完成，全省决定第一批建设六十座二号简易焦炉，现在已有十六座开始施工，3月份可陆续投入生产。第一批六十座二号简易焦炉建成投入生产后，按每座炉年产五千吨计算，今后三个季度里可生产焦炭二十多万吨，对保证钢铁生产需要将起很大作用。目前辽宁省有关领导部门和有建炉任务的市县，正在采取措施加快建炉速度。如在耐火材料生产方面，决定在保证完成国家任务和支援全国任务以外，尽先满足二号简易焦炉建设的需要。有的单位还采取了用陶瓷代钢铁、用废油筒做管道等办法，来克服材料不足的困难。为突击建设简易焦炉，有关机械工厂日夜奋战，现在已经把六十台炼焦设备赶制出来送给建炉单位。为突破技术关、给建炉准备技术力量，2月份全省还开办了筑炉和生产两个训练班，筑炉训练班培训出来的一批技术力量，已分赴各施工单位参加建设。
    本报讯　洛阳矿山机器厂今年担负着大批洗选和采矿设备的制造任务。这些设备都是为我国规模宏大的钢铁、煤炭生产基地承制的，其中有包头钢铁公司、抚顺煤矿以及河南省的平顶山、鹤壁等煤矿急需的设备。有十台洗选设备计划在3月份完成。
    洛阳矿山机器厂职工对这些产品生产十分重视。他们在上月份接到了设计图纸以后，不少人在春节期间就开始进行审查、修改、编制材料清单工作。本来这些工作需要二十二天才能完成，结果十四天就完成并交到了车间。为了确保国家计划的完成，厂党委针对今年的任务，建立了一些必要的机构和制度，编制了各项措施计划，厂、车间连续向工人进行了计划交底工作，并组织技术人员和工人一起讨论计划，学习图纸。为了解决原材料问题，厂内自己组织炼锰、炼矽等。
    担负这些产品生产的金属结构车间，正在发动工人采取一切办法完成计划。这个车间的工人正想办法修改产品设计，减少工作量，改革台具、工具。现在制造工具、设备的工作已经开始。
    本报讯　昆明冶金机械厂、云南矿山机械厂等许多机械厂，正突击赶制洗煤和简易炼焦设备，加速武装煤炭工业，以便迅速炼出质量好的焦炭来。
    目前，承担这一批洗煤、炼焦设备制造任务的各机械厂与动力制造厂的广大职工，正以以高度的生产热情，加紧进行制造。昆明冶金机械厂2月份的生产任务本来已经排满了，而且冶金设备制造任务很紧。但是，由于职工们了解到洗煤设备的制造也是当务之紧，坚决表示在完成炼铁、炼钢和轧钢配套设备任务的同时，力争完成或提前完成炼焦设备制造任务。他们在时间紧、任务急的情况下，想尽各种办法，克服原材料和技术力量不足等困难，立即开始投料制造。担负制造洗煤用的翻贯笼和手动闸门任务的云南矿山机械厂，在接受任务后，党委立即开会讨论，统一了思想认识，并在职工大会上进行了动员，安排了生产进度，决定在月底完成零件加工和全部装配任务。（附图片）
