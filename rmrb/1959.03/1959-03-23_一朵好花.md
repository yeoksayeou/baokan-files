    A Fine Flower
    The First Tractor Plant's "Thousand-Machine-Hour" campaign is a fine flower blooming in the garden of the machinery industry amidst the Great Leap Forward, and a good form of collective competition worthy of promotion.

    In modern large-scale industrial enterprises, there often exists substantial potential in equipment. However, in terms of equipment utilization rates, not all enterprises can improve the production efficiency of each machine tool to its proper level. The Luoyang Tractor Plant's implementation of the plant-wide "Thousand-Machine-Hour Red Flag Competition" precisely and practically addresses this issue. The achievements of the campaign show that all the machine tools participating in the campaign have increased their monthly output per machine, and most of them have been able to complete their monthly production tasks with efficiencies greater than the original quota by a factor of two, several times, or even more than ten times, creating unprecedented miracles. What encouraging news this is for a greater leap forward in China's industrial production!

    Advanced targets must be guaranteed by advanced measures in order for production to reach advanced levels. The "Thousand-Machine-Hour" is an advanced indicator for increasing the output per unit area in industry – the monthly output per machine tool – and also a very concrete measure. Because achieving production plan targets cannot be accomplished solely by relying on physical labor; it is necessary to carry out major technological innovations on key technologies in order to win time, seize speed, and demonstrate the maximum capacity of production equipment.

    The "Thousand-Machine-Hour" campaign has already blossomed like spring flowers in the Luoyang area, and has also begun to bloom brightly in the Dalian area. It can be asserted that in industrial enterprises throughout the country that have machine tool production, especially large industrial enterprises, soil suitable for its growth can be found. If we propagate it in large numbers, then this flower, in this vigorously developing spring, will bloom even more brilliantly and beautifully.

    一朵好花
    第一拖拉机厂的千台时运动，是大跃进形势下，机械工业园地里开放的一朵好花，也是值得推广的良好的集体竞赛形式。
    在现代化的工业大企业中，往往都拥有雄厚的设备潜力，可是，从设备利用率来看，并不是所有的企业对于每台机床的生产效率都能提高到应有的水平。洛阳拖拉机厂开展全厂性的千台时红旗竞赛运动，正好很实际地解决了这个问题。运动的成就表明：凡是参加运动的机床，都提高了它的台月工时产量，其中大多数机床都能够以大于原来定额一倍、几倍、十几倍的效率，去完成每月的生产任务，开创了史无前例的奇迹。这对于我国工业生产更大跃进该是一个多么可贵的喜讯！
    先进的指标，必须有先进的措施做保证生产才能达到先进的水平。千台时便是一个提高工业单产面积产量——每台机床月工时产量——的先进指标，也是一个十分具体的措施。因为实现生产计划指标，不是单纯凭着拼体力劳动所能达到的，而是要在技术关键上大搞技术革新，才能赢得时间，夺取速度，显示出生产设备的最大能力。
    千台时运动在洛阳地区已经像春花一样地开放，在大连地区也开始放出鲜艳的花朵。可以断言：在全国各地具有机床生产的工业企业特别是大工业企业中，都能找到适于它发育生长的土壤，如果我们将它众多地繁殖起来，那末，这支花朵在这蓬勃发展的大好春天里，将会开放得更加灿烂，更加美丽。
