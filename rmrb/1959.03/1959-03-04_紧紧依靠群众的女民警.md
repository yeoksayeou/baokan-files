The Female Policeman Who Relies Closely on the Masses
By our reporter Chen Huaining

In Nanning, Guangxi, there is a police station composed entirely of young female police officers - the Linjiang Street Police Station. Since its establishment in September of last year, this police station has relied closely on the masses in its work, solving all the old accumulated cases that had not been solved in the past few years in a short period of time, becoming a red flag in Nanning's public security work.

The area under the jurisdiction of this police station includes more than 2,000 households and 80 organizations, with some areas located at the junction of urban and rural areas, large and scattered, and the situation is complex. However, these unfavorable conditions do not affect their outstanding achievements at work. Because they are all Communist Party members and know how to utilize the wisdom and strength of the masses to complete their work, making the work both fast and good.

As soon as the police station was established, they immediately dealt with the backlog of civil and criminal cases. In the process of handling old accumulated cases, they all conducted in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, and discussed with the mass activists. There was a theft case that occurred in October 1956, which had not been solved in the past. After the establishment of this police station composed of female police officers, the deputy director Lei Defang was responsible for solving the case. She first held a mass meeting and reported the details of the case to everyone; she also held two discussion meetings near the victim's home to inspire everyone to recall whether there were any suspicious clues among the people they had contacted at the time. Then, she conducted many individual interviews and talked with the masses, gathering the bits and pieces of clues provided by the masses for research, and continued to investigate based on these clues. After her repeated investigation and research, the truth of the case finally came to light.

Because they understand the importance of relying on the masses in their work, they are always concerned about the interests of the masses. As long as it is a matter beneficial to the masses, no matter how big or small, they do not tire of trying their best to do it. They often call meetings of children on the streets, patiently educating them to pay attention to fire prevention, abide by traffic rules, and cherish public property. If they find lost children, even in the middle of the night, as long as they find out which family they belong to, they will try to send them back. They also pay special attention to educating the few masses with backward ideas. Occasionally, when they encounter street residents who do not get along well, they try their best to mediate, so that everyone is united and friendly. There is a middle-aged woman named Huang de'ai in Zhongshan East Second Lane. She often quarrels with others, and residents nearby are unwilling to approach her. Over the years, many police officers have mediated her disputes with others, but none have been completely resolved. After the establishment of this police station composed of female police officers, a female police officer was determined to educate Huang de'ai well. After individual conversations, she learned that Huang de'ai was very poor before liberation. After liberation, her life had improved, but she had to go to work on construction sites during the day, and she had four children at home, so she was busy with housework, which made her unwilling to participate in street social activities, and she was easily irritable and quarreled with others. Based on these circumstances, the female police officer patiently conducted class education for her, explaining that after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, her life had improved, and she had turned over politically. Today's society requires everyone to be united, friendly, respectful and helpful to each other. She also often helped her with housework and cared about her life and production. Huang de'ai was sincerely grateful for the female police officer's care and help, which led to a significant change. Now, she not only actively participates in various social activities, but also no longer quarrels with neighbors.

The female police officers of the Linjiang Street Police Station have become increasingly close to the masses through these activities of loving the people, and the masses are more actively helping them to do a good job in public security. Last year, due to their outstanding work, they were rated as an advanced unit in Nanning's public security work and were selected as representatives to participate in the Nanning Municipal Congress of Socialist Construction Activists. Now, as the "March 8th" International Women's Day is approaching, they are all full of confidence and guarantee that they will make even greater achievements in their work this year.

    紧紧依靠群众的女民警
    本报记者　陈怀宁
    在广西南宁市，有一个全部由年轻的女人民警察组成的派出所——临江街派出所。这个派出所从去年9月成立以来，由于在工作中紧紧依靠群众，在短短时间内就全部破获了过去几年来所没有破获的旧积案，成为南宁市公安工作的一面红旗。
    这个公安派出所管辖的地区内，有二千多户居民和八十个机关，部分地区还处在城乡交界，大而分散，情况复杂。但这些不利条件丝毫也不影响她们工作取得出色的成绩。因为她们都是共产党员，懂得如何发挥群众的智慧和力量来完成工作，使工作做得既快又好。
    派出所一成立，她们就突击处理过去积压下来的民事和刑事案件。在处理旧积案的过程中，她们都经过深入细致的调查研究，和群众积极分子一起商量。有一件盗窃案，还是1956年10月发生的，过去一直没有破获。这个女民警组成的派出所成立以后，由副所长雷德芳负责破获这个案件。她首先召开群众大会，向大家详细报告了案情；又在失主家附近开了两次座谈会，启发大家回忆当时所接触的人中，有没有可疑的线索。然后，她又多次进行个别访问，同群众交谈，把群众所提供的一点一滴线索集中起来进行研究，并根据这些线索继续追查。经过她这样反复调查研究，终于使这一案件水落石出，真象大白了。
    由于她们懂得在工作中依靠群众的重要，因此她们处处都关心群众的利益。只要是对群众有利的事，不管大小，她们都不厌其烦地尽力去做。她们经常召集街道上的儿童们开会，耐心教育他们要注意防火，遵守交通规则，要爱护公共财物。拾到了迷路儿童，那怕是在深夜里，只要查出是那家的，她们都想法给送去。她们还特别注意对少数思想落后的群众进行教育，偶而遇到街道居民相处不睦，她们就想尽办法调解，使得大家团结友爱。中山东二里有一个名叫黄的爱的中年妇女，她经常跟别人吵嘴，附近居民都不愿同她接近。几年来，许多民警都调解过她和别人的纠纷，但都没有彻底解决。这个女民警组成的派出所成立后，一位女民警决心把黄的爱教育好。她经过个别谈话，了解到黄的爱解放前很贫苦，解放后生活有了改善，但自己白天要上工地工作，家里又有四个小孩，家务事很忙，使她不愿参加街道社会活动，而且心情烦燥，容易跟人吵嘴。根据这些情况，这位女民警耐心向她进行阶级教育，说明解放后在党的领导下她生活改善了，政治上也翻了身，今天的社会个个都要团结友爱，互敬互助。并且经常帮助她做家务事，关心她的生活和生产。黄的爱衷心感激这位女民警对她的关心和帮助，从而就有了显著的转变。现在，她不但积极参加各种社会活动，也不同邻居吵嘴了。
    临江街派出所的女民警们，通过这些爱民活动同群众的关系日益密切，群众都更加积极地帮助她们做好治安工作。去年，由于她们的工作做得出色，被评为南宁市公安工作的先进单位，选出代表参加了南宁市建设社会主义积极分子代表大会。现在，在“三八”国际妇女节即将到来的时候，她们个个信心百倍，保证今年工作一定做出更大的成绩。
