Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 25th: The troops in the Jinan area of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held a poetry and painting exhibition. The audience gave high praise to the exhibited poetry and paintings.

A total of 202 poems and 1,180 pieces of art were exhibited at this exhibition. These works were carefully selected from the mass literary and artistic creations of the troops in the Jinan area last year. Most of the authors of these works are soldiers who have only recently escaped illiteracy. When describing their determination to learn culture and practice writing poetry at that time, they wrote such poems: "The Red Army is not afraid of the Long March, the soldiers are not afraid of the mountain of culture. No need for ten years of hard study, determined to become a champion in three months." "The stars in the sky are countless, the poets on the ground compete with the stars, if you ask where the author is, he is in the big family of the company."

The exhibition opened on March 1st and will end its exhibition in Jinan at the end of March. Then, it will go to various troops for a touring exhibition.

    济南地区部队举办诗画展览会
    新华社济南25日电　中国人民解放军济南地区部队最近举办了一个诗画展览会。观众对展出的诗画给了很高的评价。
    在这个展览会上，共展出诗歌二百零二首、美术作品一千一百八十件。这些作品都是济南地区部队从去年群众性的文艺创作中精选出来的。这些作品的作者大部分是刚摆脱文盲状态不久的士兵。他们在描写自己当时学文化和练习写诗的决心时写下了这样的诗句：“红军不怕远征难，战士不怕文化山，不用十年寒窗苦，决心三月当状元。”“天上星星数不清，地下诗人赛星星，要问作者在何处，就在连队的大家庭。”
    这个展览会是从3月1日开幕的，将在3月底结束在济南的展出。然后，还要到各部队作巡回展览。
