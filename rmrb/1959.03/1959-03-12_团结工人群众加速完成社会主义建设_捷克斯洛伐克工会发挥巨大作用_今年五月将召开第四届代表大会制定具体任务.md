Prague, March 11th (by our correspondent Yang Yi) – “In the coming period, the role of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions will be increasingly expanded. It will become an important organizational form for the Czechoslovak Communist Party to unite, mobilize, and organize the working masses to accelerate the completion of socialist construction.” This was stated by Bashek, Secretary of the Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, during a recent interview with reporters.

Bashek said that after the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party last year, the responsibilities of the trade union, as the largest organization of the Czechoslovak working class, have increased. In order to enable the working people to actively participate in the management and leadership of production, Czechoslovakia has adopted a number of effective methods. These include the establishment of production meetings, technical and economic meetings, and comprehensive technical groups in factories; the development of socialist labor emulation; the promotion of rationalization campaigns; the mobilization of the masses to participate in the preparation and discussion of production plans; and the signing of collective contracts between enterprise leaders and workers.

The responsibility of the trade union is to ensure the widespread implementation of these measures in all sectors, to give play to the political and production enthusiasm of the working masses, so as to increase production and improve labor productivity. In particular, the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," as a new and higher form of socialist labor emulation, should continue to be vigorously carried out.

In talking about the role of the trade union in caring for the lives and welfare of the working people, completing the cultural revolution, conducting ideological, cultural, and technical education for workers, especially young workers, and supporting rural areas and schools, Bashek emphasized that since the implementation of the reform of the national economic management last year, with the expansion of enterprise powers, the powers of the trade union have also increased. Now the trade union and administrative leaders work closely together to prepare, discuss, and formulate programs related to enterprise management, planning, and finance. In the past, these were directly issued by various central ministries, and the trade union had no opportunity to participate in opinions. The increase in the role of the trade union is also reflected in the transfer of some functions from the administration to the trade union. For example, the factory welfare fund is entirely controlled by the trade union, and the organization and awarding of labor competitions are also entirely the responsibility of the trade union.

Bashek especially mentioned the Fourth Congress of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, scheduled to be held from May 13th to 17th this year. The main task of this congress is to formulate the specific tasks of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions during the period of Czechoslovakia's completion of socialist construction.

In accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the responsibilities of the trade union in industrial production are to ensure the maximum participation of the working people in production and state management, to promote greater participation of the working masses in the preparation and realization of state plans, to continue to improve the level of the "Socialist Labor Team" competition, and to assist in the implementation of the new wage system.

The trade union should also strengthen its influence in the political and ideological spheres, raise the communist consciousness of the working masses, so that the ideological revolution can keep pace with economic construction, and the creativity and enthusiasm of the working people can be given greater play.

Bashek pointed out: "In order to complete new and more ambitious political tasks, it is necessary to improve the level of trade union organizational work. Our slogan is: 'Face the factory – face the place that determines the fate of the new tasks.'"

Bashek finally told reporters that the preparations for the Fourth Congress of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions have already begun in the autumn of last year. 25,000 grassroots organizations and trade union committees at all levels have held meetings for this purpose. The fifteen national industrial trade unions will also hold meetings from next month to elect more than 1,600 delegates to attend the congress. Bashek said with confidence that this congress will further enhance the enthusiasm and efforts of the Czechoslovak working class in striving to build socialism, will consolidate the unity of the international working class, and promote their joint efforts in solving problems related to the working class.

    团结工人群众加速完成社会主义建设
    捷克斯洛伐克工会发挥巨大作用
    今年五月将召开第四届代表大会制定具体任务
    本报布拉格11日电　记者杨翊报道：“在今后时期中，捷克斯洛伐克工会的作用将日益扩大，它将成为捷克斯洛伐克共产党团结、动员和组织工人群众加速完成社会主义建设的重要的组织形式。”这是捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会书记巴歇克日前接见记者时谈到的。
    巴歇克说，在去年捷共第十一次代表大会以后，作为捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级最大组织的工会的责任加重了。为了使劳动人民积极参加生产的管理和领导，捷克斯洛伐克采取了一些有效的方式。如在工厂成立生产会议、技术经济会议和综合技术小组，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，倡导合理化运动，发动群众参与生产计划的编制和讨论，以及签订企业领导和工人之间的集体合同等。
    工会的责任是保证这些措施在一切部门的广泛实施，发挥劳动群众的政治和生产积极性，以增加生产和提高劳动生产率。作为社会主义劳动竞赛新的更高形式的争取
  “社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛运动，尤其应该继续大力开展。
    在谈到工会在关怀劳动人民生活福利，完成文化革命，进行对工人特别是青年工人的思想、文化和技术教育，以及支援农村和学校等方面的作用后，巴歇克着重指出，从去年国民经济管理改组实行以来，随着企业权力的扩大，工会的权力也有了增长。现在工会和行政领导密切协作，共同准备讨论和制定有关企业管理、计划和财务的方案。而过去这是由中央各部直接颁发的，工会没有机会参与意见。工会作用的增长，也表现在行政将一些职能转交给工会方面。如工厂福利基金完全由工会支配，劳动竞赛的组织和评奖也全部交工会负责。
    巴歇克特别谈到预定在今年5月13日到17日召开的捷克斯洛伐克工会第四届代表大会。这次大会的主要任务，是制定捷克斯洛伐克工会在捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设时期的具体任务。
    根据捷共第十一次代表大会决议的精神，工会在工业生产方面的职责是保证劳动人民最大限度地参加生产和国家管理，促使工人群众更多地参与国家计划的编制和实现，继续提高争取“社会主义劳动队”竞赛的水平和协助推行新工资制度等。
    工会还要加强政治思想方面的影响，提高工人群众的共产主义觉悟，使思想革命能跟上经济建设的步伐，使劳动人民的创造性和积极性得到更大的发挥。
    巴歇克指出：“为了完成新的、更宏伟的政治任务，必须提高工会组织工作的水平。我们的口号是：
  ‘面向工厂——面向决定着新任务命运的场所’。”
    巴歇克最后告诉记者，捷克斯洛伐克工会第四届代表大会的准备工作，从去年秋季就已经开始。二万五千个基层组织和各级工会委员会，都为此召开了会议。十五个全国性的产业工会也将从下月份起举行会议，选举出席代表大会的一千六百多名代表。巴歇克满怀信心地说，这次大会将会进一步提高捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级为建成社会主义而奋斗的热情和努力，将巩固国际工人阶级的团结，促进他们在解决与工人阶级有关问题上的共同努力。
