1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our motherland. We are silkworm industry workers from 24 provinces, cities, and regions across the country. We are participating in the tea and silkworm production leap forward conference in the great capital of the motherland, and have listened to the Ministry of Agriculture's report on silkworm production in 1958 and the doubling of mulberry silkworm cocoon production and tripling of tussah silkworm cocoon production in 1959, which greatly encouraged our confidence and determination to realize a great leap forward in silkworm production in our motherland. We must continue to exert our efforts, remain unremitting, and work together with silkworm cadres and the broad masses of people engaged in silk production across the country to strive to complete this year's silkworm production tasks. We propose:

	One, Guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the task of doubling this year's mulberry silkworm cocoon production and tripling the tussah silkworm cocoon production, striving to exceed the highest pre-war levels.

	Two, Adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, oppose right-leaning conservative ideas, promote the daring and pioneering communist style, and work hard, practically, and skillfully to complete the tasks, in order to meet the needs of the country and the people.

	Three, Grasp mulberry, grasp tussah, and grasp silkworms simultaneously. Using about 20% of the mulberry fields, tussah forests, and silkworm seed quantity, launch a large-scale high-yield movement, requiring unit yields to be more than double the average yield.

	Four, Conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" (soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tool reform, and field management), and do everything possible to increase the production of mulberry leaves and tussah leaves, achieving "a thousand dan of fertilizer and a thousand jin of leaves per mu," and "a thousand mulberry trees and ten thousand branches."

	Five, Achieve multiple silkworm rearing, requiring cocoon production to "exceed last year's spring cocoons in the spring and exceed spring cocoons in the autumn," and "high yields in all four seasons and a full harvest throughout the year." Implement five "goods" in silkworm rearing: "good food, good environmental hygiene, good silkworm seeds, good management, and good tool reform."

	Six, Taking state-owned silkworm seed farms as the core, vigorously establish people's commune silkworm seed farms to breed silkworm seeds and cultivate high-quality mulberry silkworm and tussah silkworm breeds. Silkworm seed breeding implements five selections: egg selection, silkworm selection, cocoon selection, pupa selection, and moth selection.

	Seven, Implement the principle of "prevention is more important than cure, combining indigenous and foreign methods," completely eliminate pests and diseases, and ensure safe production.

	Eight, Vigorously carry out technological revolution and actively reform tools to improve labor efficiency and save manpower. Promote the "fast and economical" silkworm rearing method that is "faster, more economical, better, and more efficient" for mulberry silkworms, and popularize the "fixed ant farm" to protect seedlings and precisely release tussah silkworms. Vigorously engage in invention and innovation, and gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization of silkworm production within two to three years.

	Nine, Give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, establish and consolidate specialized teams for silkworm production, establish and improve production responsibility systems, train specialized personnel, and improve scientific and technological levels.

	Ten, Spring silkworm production is the first hurdle in the greater leap forward of 1959. We must immediately do all the preparatory work, and fire the first shot to welcome the spring silkworm harvest and obtain a huge victory for the whole year.

    蚕业生产十大倡议（摘要）
    1959年是我们祖国工农业生产更大更好更全面跃进的一年。我们是来自全国二十四个省、市、区的蚕业工作者，在祖国伟大的首都参加茶蚕生产跃进会议，听取了农业部对1958年蚕业生产和1959年桑蚕茧翻一番，柞蚕茧翻二番的报告，大大地鼓舞了我们为实现祖国蚕业生产大跃进的信心和决心。我们要继续鼓足干劲，始终不懈地和全国蚕业干部以及从事蚕丝生产的广大人民一道，努力完成今年蚕业生产任务。我们倡议：
    一、保证完成和超额完成今年桑蚕茧产量翻一番，柞蚕茧翻两番的任务，力争超过战前最高水平。
    二、坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，反对右倾保守思想，发扬敢想敢作的共产主义风格，苦干、实干、巧干地完成任务，以满足国家和人民的需要。
    三、抓桑、抓柞、又抓蚕，以20％左右的桑田、柞林和蚕种量，开展大面积丰产运动，要求单位产量比平均产量高一倍以上。
    四、认真贯彻“八字宪法”，千方百计增产桑叶和柞叶，作到采一次叶施一次肥，达到每亩“千担肥，千斤叶”，“千株桑，万根条”。
    五、实现多次养蚕，要求产茧量“春茧超去年，秋茧超春茧”，“四季高产，全年丰收”。养蚕贯彻五好：“吃得好、环境卫生好、蚕种好、管理好、工具改革好”。
    六、以国营蚕种场为核心大办人民公社蚕种场，繁殖蚕种，培育品质优良的桑蚕种和柞蚕种。蚕种繁殖实行五选：选卵、选蚕、选茧、选蛹、选蛾。
    七、贯彻“防重于治，土洋结合”的方针，彻底消灭病虫危害，保证安全生产。
    八、大搞技术革命积极进行工具改革，提高劳动效率，节省人力。桑蚕推广多快好省的“快省”养蚕方法，柞蚕普及“固定蚁场”保苗精放。大搞发明创造，在二、三年内逐步实现蚕业生产半机械化和机械化。
    九、充分发挥人民公社的优越性，建立与巩固蚕业生产的专业队，建立与健全生产责任制，培训专业人员，提高科学技术水平。
    十、春蚕生产是1959年更大跃进的第一关。必须立即做好一切准备工作，为迎接春蚕丰收，获得全年巨大胜利打响第一炮。
