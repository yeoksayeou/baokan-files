To eliminate detours in commodity allocation, the Beijing Dongmen Warehouse promotes delivery directly from stations, factories, and warehouses to reduce handling.

(This report) Our newspaper reports that the Dongmen Warehouse of the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company is vigorously promoting the practice of direct commodity delivery from stations (railway stations), factories, and warehouses, greatly reducing commodity handling and saving expenses.

In the past, the Dongmen Warehouse only used direct delivery for popular goods purchased by large stores such as the Department Store. Most commodities were still transported back and forth between factories, warehouses, and stores. Since November of last year, based on the new situation of expanded supply tasks, the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company has vigorously promoted the "three direct" commodity delivery method of direct delivery from stations, factories, and warehouses. Currently, direct delivery relationships have been established with over one hundred retail units, more than ten wholesale departments, and over twenty factories. The direct delivery volume of popular commodities such as cloth shoes, batteries, and enamel products has reached 80% to 90% of the factory's total production.

The benefits of adopting direct commodity delivery are the reduction of commodity roundabout transportation and the acceleration of capital turnover. For example, last year, the total value of directly delivered goods was over 17 million yuan, saving approximately 80,000 flatbed tricycle trips. In the past, it generally took three to seven days for goods to go from the factory to the sales unit, but now it is basically possible to ensure that goods are shipped from the factory and sold on the same day. The cooperative relationship between industry and commerce, as well as wholesale and retail, has also been strengthened as a result. Factories and enterprises have welcomed the direct commodity delivery work. The implementation of direct commodity delivery has also saved a large number of packaging materials. In November and December of last year alone, the direct delivery of ten commodities such as cloth shoes saved more than 18,000 wooden and cardboard boxes and nearly 20,000 city feet of wrapping cloth.

    商品调拨不走弯路
    北京东门仓批发部推行就站就厂就库发货减少搬运量
    本报讯　北京市百货批发公司东门仓批发部，大力推行就站（火车站）、就厂（工厂）、就库（仓库）直拨商品的工作方法，大大减少了商品搬运环节，节约了费用开支。
    东门仓批发部的商品直拨工作，过去只对百货大楼等几个大型商店采购畅销货时采取直拨方法，绝大部分商品仍在工厂、仓库、商店之间往返搬运。去年11月份以来，北京市百货批发公司根据供应任务扩大的新形势，大力推行就站、就厂、就库的“三就”直拨商品的工作方法。目前已建立直拨关系的有一百多个零售单位，十多个批发部和二十多个工厂，一般畅销商品如布胶鞋、电池，搪瓷制品等产品的直拨量已达到厂方生产总量的百分之八十到百分之九十。
    采用直拨商品的好处是，减少了商品迂回运输，加速了资金周转。如去年直拨商品总值一千七百多万元，约节省平板三轮八万多车次。过去，商品由出厂到销售单位，一般需要三天到七天的时间，现在基本上可以作到当日出厂，当日销售。工商、批零之间的协作关系，也因此加强了，工厂企业对商品直拨工作都表示欢迎。由于推行了商品直拨，还节省了大量包装用品。仅在去年11、12两月内直拨的布胶鞋等十种商品，就节省木箱、纸箱一万八千多个和包皮布近两万市尺。
