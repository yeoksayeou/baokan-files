Good News from the Coal Front

Guizhou Province, Fangzi Mine, and Others Fulfill First Quarter Tasks Ahead of Schedule

    (Our report) Guizhou Province's coal industry workers, after more than two months of hard work, have produced 2.18 million tons of raw coal, exceeding the first quarter plan by 9%; and produced 205,000 tons of coke, exceeding the first quarter plan by 247.4%.

    Vigorously developing small coal kilns and carrying out technological innovation, enabling small coal kilns to exert tremendous power in completing production plans, is the key to the rapid increase in coal production in Guizhou. According to statistics, small coal kilns accounted for more than 92% of the total output in completing the first quarter plan. Anshun, Zunyi, Bijie and other regions regarded the transformation of small coal kilns as the key to completing tasks, mobilized the masses to speak out and debate, and offered suggestions, so that many small coal kilns achieved vehicle transportation, self-tipping, and wooden rails, greatly improving labor productivity.

    In terms of coal washing and coking, in order to meet the standard of metallurgical coke, various places have taken many measures, such as giving priority to mining high-quality coking coal; changing ditch coal washing to multi-layer coal selection; adding appropriate amount of lime during coal washing and coking to reduce the sulfur content of coal coke; and paying attention to coal quality and carrying out manual selection at the coal mine working face.

    In March, all staff of the Provincial Coal Management Bureau also implemented a system of contracted responsibility for each area, going deep into the grassroots to direct production, and sent working groups to various sites to tackle technical problems, ensuring the double leap forward of production and capital construction.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 22) Shandong Fangzi Coal Mine, which has been overfulfilling production quotas every month since the beginning of this year, has completed the first quarter's national raw coal production plan half a month ahead of schedule. Now all the mine's workers are advancing victoriously, taking various measures to improve the daily output level, and are determined to increase raw coal production by another 80,000 tons for the country before the end of March.

    This coal mine resolutely implemented the state's technical policies this year and carried out production in accordance with regular mining procedures. Therefore, the amount of coal obtained in preparation for mining and labor productivity have been significantly improved, and the cost has been reduced by 14.7% compared to the plan. They learned from the past lessons of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end, and being passive step by step. At the beginning of this year, they grasped planning and production scheduling, checked the plan on a daily and ten-day basis, and organized balanced production. At the same time, starting from December last year, they focused on the weak link of tunneling lagging behind mining, established a new tunneling area, equipped it with full-time cadres, and organized rapid tunneling teams, so that the amount of coal obtained in preparation increased from the past four months to nearly six months, providing conditions for regular high production.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 22) Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant of Huainan Coal Mine has completed the first quarter's national production plan ten days ahead of schedule on the 21st, washing and selecting a total of 230,000 tons of raw coal. The washed and selected refined coking coal has all supported the iron and steel enterprises in Ma'anshan, Hefei, Huainan and other places.

    Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant is a modern factory that was put into production at the end of last year. Although the factory has only been put into production for a short time and the workers are not yet familiar with the operation, they have shown a high degree of enthusiasm, constantly overcome difficulties, explored experience, studied technology, and improved production. Due to the workers' earnest efforts to strengthen maintenance, all of the factory's more than 300 machines have achieved normal operation during production time, and the production level has been higher month by month. After completing the first quarter's production plan, the workers of this factory are now continuing to work hard to strive to wash and select 30,000 tons more raw coal than planned in the first quarter.

    煤炭战线捷报早传
    贵州省、坊子矿等提前完成首季任务
    本报讯　贵州省煤炭工业战线职工经过两个多月的奋战，已经生产原煤二百一十八万吨，超额9％完成了第一季度计划；生产焦炭二十万五千吨，超额247.4％完成第一季度计划。
    大搞小煤窑改造，进行技术革新，使小煤窑在完成生产计划中发挥巨大的威力，这是贵州煤炭生产迅速上升的关键。据统计，在完成第一季度计划中，全省小煤窑的产量占总产量的92％以上。安顺、遵义、毕节等专区，把小煤窑的改造工作，当作完成任务的关键，发动群众鸣放辩论，献计献策，因而有不少小煤窑实现了车子化、自翻化、木轨化，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    在洗煤炼焦方面，为了达到冶金焦的标准，各地采取了很多措施，如尽先开采优质焦煤；改地沟洗煤为多层选煤；在洗煤炼焦时加进适量石灰，以减少煤焦的含硫量；在矿井工作面注意煤质，进行手选。
    在3月份，省煤管局全体职工还实行了分片包干，深入基层指挥生产，并派出工作组分赴各现场猛攻技术关，保证生产、基建的双双跃进。
    新华社济南22日电　今年以来月月超产的山东坊子煤矿，已经提前半个月完成了首季国家原煤生产计划。现在全矿职工正乘胜前进，采取各种措施提高日产水平，决心在3月底前再为国家增产原煤八万吨。
    这个煤矿今年坚决贯彻了国家的技术政策，按照正规开采程序进行生产。因此，使准备开采的获得煤量和劳动生产率有了显著提高，成本也比计划降低14.7％。他们吸取以往月初松月末紧，一步被动步步被动的教训，今年一开始就通过抓计划、抓生产调度，按日按旬地检查计划，组织均衡生产。同时，从去年12月开始就抓住掘进落后于回采的这一薄弱环节，成立新的掘进区，配备专职干部，组织快速掘进队，使准备下来的获得煤量由过去的可采四个多月增加到将近六个月，为正规高产提供了条件。
    新华社合肥22日电　淮南煤矿望峰岗洗选厂已在21日提前十天完成了第一季度国家生产计划，共洗选出原煤二十三万吨。洗选出来的炼焦精煤，全部支援了马鞍山、合肥、淮南等地的钢铁企业。
    望峰岗洗选厂是去年年底投入生产的一座现代化工厂。虽然工厂刚投入生产不久，职工们操作还不熟悉，但是他们发挥了高度积极性，不断克服困难，摸索经验，钻研技术，提高生产。由于职工认真加强保养工作，全厂三百多台机器在生产时间都达到了正常运转，生产水平一月比一月高。这个工厂的职工在完成第一季度生产计划后，现在正在继续努力，争取第一季度比计划多洗选三万吨原煤。
