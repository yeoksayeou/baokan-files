    China's Largest Sugar Warehouse - Guangdong
    By our correspondent Zhao Ying
    Dear Reader: In Guangdong Province, the southernmost part of our country, what attracts you most? Is it its particularly rich grain, fish, shrimp, and fruits? Or its evergreen, picturesque rivers and mountains? Of course, these are all lovely, but in addition to these, this rich and beautiful Guangdong also has more sugarcane fields than any other province in our country, and sugar factories with the highest output in the country.
    Here, whether it is the Pearl River Delta, the land of fish and rice, the border areas of the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, or the coastal Shantou area and the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong, there are tall and dense sugarcane forests everywhere, and sugar factories are filled with the fragrance of sugar. Compared with other regions, it really has a unique flavor. Walking into the sugar refining workshop of the Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Plant, the largest in our country with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 3,000 tons, you can see huge cranes sending bundles of sugarcane, like small mountains, to the machines for crushing and refining. From another place, you can see crystal-clear white sugar, like a huge stream, gushing out from the conveyor. The packed sugar will quickly make the wide warehouse crowded. Here, the entire sugar production process is automated and mechanized.
    Currently, Guangdong Province has eleven large sugar factories with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of over 1,000 tons, along with a total of ninety-six medium and small sugar factories. These sugar factories can consume nearly 40,000 tons of sugarcane and produce 5,000 tons of sugar every day. In addition, there are thousands of earthen sugar workshops, producing about 100,000 tons of sugar each pressing season.
    Guangdong has a mild climate, which is the best place for sugarcane to grow. Not only is the planting area large, but the yield is also very high. This year's sugarcane planting area will increase from more than 2.1 million mu last year to 2.5 million mu.
    Guangdong started making sugar as early as more than 1,300 years ago. However, the real development of the sugar industry came after liberation. The vast majority of sugar factories in Guangdong were newly built after liberation. In recent years, two new sugar industry bases have been opened up in Hainan Island and the Zhanjiang area. Sugar production has grown even faster. Last year, the province produced more than 425,000 tons of sugar, equivalent to 16.8% of the country's total sugar production. This year, the estimated output will reach about 800,000 tons.
    Before liberation, Chen Jitang of Guangdong wanted to build a sugar factory, but before the sugar factory was completed, he hurriedly bought "foreign sugar" from Hong Kong, labeled it, and sold it at high prices as sugar produced in Guangdong. In fact, the chimney of the sugar factory hadn't even started smoking! Since then, the name "smokeless sugar factory" has been passed on as a joke. However, now Guangdong can say without shame: we have built a complete sugar industry system. Now, the young Guangdong Provincial Light Industry Design Institute can not only skillfully design sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of several hundred tons, but also designed large sugar factories with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons with good quality. The Guangdong machinery industry, which had a very poor foundation, has also developed into being able to provide complete sets of sugar-making equipment for large, medium, and small sugar factories.
    Last year, the drums of the Great Leap Forward brought about a huge change in the sugar industry. Sugarcane, which was always considered to be only used for making sugar and as fuel, can now be comprehensively utilized at the Jiangmen Sugarcane Chemical Plant to produce a wide variety of products. This major discovery has shown new prospects for the sugarcane sugar industry, marking that a seasonal, single-production sugar factory will be transformed into a factory that operates in multiple varieties and produces year-round. Now, this factory is not just a sugar factory, but has become a model and pace-setter for the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane, a veritable sugarcane chemical plant.
    Now, dozens and hundreds of sugar factories in Guangdong Province have taken a big step towards the comprehensive utilization of sugarcane. Many sugar factories have built auxiliary workshops for alcohol, papermaking, dry ice, sugarcane wax, and furfural by relying on their own efforts and using indigenous methods, which not only produces various products to serve socialist industry and the people's lives, but also greatly increases the output value of the sugar factories.
    Just like the national support for Guangdong's coal and steel, Guangdong also enthusiastically dedicated its rich sugar industry equipment to brother provinces and regions. In recent years, while developing and strengthening its own sugar base, Guangdong has also provided design drawings, sugar machinery, and a large number of technical personnel, as well as excellent varieties of sugarcane, to Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Hunan and other provinces.
    In addition, since last year, Guangdong Province has also undertaken the task of designing sugar factories and providing equipment and training personnel for our close neighbor - the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. (Attached picture)

    我国最大的糖仓——广东
    本报记者　赵颖
    亲爱的读者：在祖国最南方的广东省，什么东西最吸引你？是她特别富饶的粮食、鱼虾、水果？——还是它的四季常青、姿态似画的河山景色？固然，这些都很可爱，但是，除此之外，在这富饶美丽的广东，还有着比我国其他省都要来得多的甘蔗园，和产量居全国首位的糖厂呢。
    在这里，不论是鱼米之乡的珠江三角洲，边陲的雷州半岛和海南岛，或是滨海的汕头地区和粤北山区，到处都有高高密密的甘蔗林，和糖香四溢的糖厂。同别的地区相比，真是别有一番风味。走到我国最大的、日榨甘蔗三千吨的江门甘蔗化工厂制糖车间，就可以看到，巨大的起重机，把像小山一样的甘蔗一捆捆送到机器去压榨和煮炼，从另外一个地方，你可以看到晶莹可爱的白砂糖，像一股巨流似的从输送机冲击出来，经过打包的糖，很快就会使宽大的仓库变得拥挤不堪。在这里整个糖的生产过程都是自动化机械化的。
    现在，广东全省已有日榨甘蔗千吨以上的大糖厂十一个，连同中小型糖厂共有九十六个。这些糖厂每天可以吞食近四万吨甘蔗，生产出五千吨食糖。此外，还有几千个土糖作坊，每个榨季，生产食糖十万吨左右。
    广东气候温和，是甘蔗生长最好的地方，不但种植的面积大，产量也很高。今年的甘蔗种植面积要由去年的二百一十多万亩增加到二百五十万亩。
    远在一千三百多年以前，广东就已经开始制糖。但是真正发展制糖工业还是解放以后的事情。广东的制糖厂，绝大多数是解放后新建的。最近几年，还新辟了海南岛和湛江专区两个新的糖业基地。糖产量增长得更快，去年全省产糖四十二万五千多吨，相当于全国产糖量的16.8％。而今年预计产量要达到八十万吨左右。
    解放前广东省的陈济棠，曾想办糖厂，但是没有等到糖厂建成，就急急忙忙从香港买了“洋糖”，贴上商标，冒充广东出产的糖高价出卖。实际上糖厂的烟囱还没冒烟呢！从此，“无烟糖厂”之名就被人们当笑话传开了。但是，现在广东可以毫无愧色地说：我们已经建起了一个完整的制糖工业体系。现在，年轻的广东省轻工业设计院，不仅能熟练地作出日榨几百吨的糖厂设计，而且设计出了质量很好的日榨甘蔗两千吨的大糖厂。基础很差的广东机械工业，也发展成为可以为大中小型糖厂提供全套制糖设备了。
    去年，大跃进的战鼓使制糖工业发生了一个巨大的变化，一向被认为只能制糖和作燃料的甘蔗，在江门甘蔗化工厂已经可以综合利用它来生产多种多样的产品了。这个重大的发现为甘蔗制糖工业展示了新的前景，它标志着：一个季节性的单一生产的糖厂，将要变为经营多品种和长年生产的厂了。现在，这个厂不单单是个糖厂，已成为综合利用甘蔗的榜样、标兵、名符其实的甘蔗化工厂。
    现在，广东省成十上百的糖厂已经向甘蔗的综合利用迈开了一大步。许多糖厂用自力更生土法上马的办法，建起了酒精、造纸、干冰、蔗腊、糠醛等附属车间，不仅生产出了各种产品为社会主义工业和人民生活服务，而且糖厂的产值大大增加。
    像全国各地大力支援广东的煤炭、钢材等情况一样，广东也把丰富的制糖工业装备热情地献给兄弟省区。这几年来，广东在发展壮大自己糖业基地的同时，还为广西、福建、江西、云南、湖南等省区提供了大中小型糖厂的设计图纸，糖业机械，和大批的技术人材，以及甘蔗优良品种等。
    此外，从去年开始，广东省还担负了为我国的亲密邻邦——越南民主共和国设计糖厂和提供设备、培养人材的任务。（附图片）
