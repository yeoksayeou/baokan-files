Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th. The 1959 National Athlete-Level Gymnastics Championships held in Guangzhou concluded all competition events on the evening of the 10th.

After five days of intense competition, the men's and women's team championships were both won by the Guangdong team. Second place went to the Hebei men's and women's teams. The Beijing men's and women's teams took third place. In the individual all-around competition, the men's all-around champion was won by Guo Shuzeng, an athlete-level gymnast from the Heilongjiang team, with a total score of 106.75 points (out of a possible 120 points); Guo Keyu, an athlete-level gymnast from the Hebei team, won the women's all-around championship with a total score of 72.90 points (out of a possible 80 points).

The fourth to sixth places in the team competition were: Jiangsu team, Shanghai team, and Liaoning team for men, and Sichuan team, Jiangsu team, and Yunnan team for women.
