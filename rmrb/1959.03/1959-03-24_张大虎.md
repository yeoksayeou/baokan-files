    Zhang Dahu

    Zhang Dahu is a worker in the transportation team of the mining factory. He is about forty years old, very tall, standing like a mountain, with broad shoulders that seem to be made of iron. Since joining the factory, he has quickly earned respect because he picks more and carries heavier loads.
    In this Red Flag competition, Dahu carried over a hundred pounds of pottery clay in one load, walking more than two miles from the mining area to the pottery factory work area. He consistently led during the first five loads. Later, a young man from the second team named Xiaoniu surpassed him with a higher number, and Zhang Dahu consistently fell behind Xiaoniu.
    The fellow workers discussed the matter:
    "Dahu lost the competition, not for any other reason, probably because he ate too much today!"
    "It's a bit hard to believe that a big tiger can't beat a little ox."
    The factory's Party Committee Secretary, Secretary Liu, came to Zhang Dahu's dormitory during the evening break. Dahu was soaking his feet in a basin of warm water. When he saw Secretary Liu coming, he hurriedly wiped his feet and stood up to greet him.
    "Some people say you lost today's competition to Xiaoniu because you ate too much," Secretary Liu said, sitting down.
    "Is that the reason?"
    Dahu poured Secretary Liu a cup of tea, smiled, and said, "It's not because I ate too much, it's..."
    "Sit down and talk!"
    "It's a long story," Dahu said, sitting down:
    "I started working as a laborer in the kiln at the age of sixteen, carrying pine branches from the riverbank to the kiln hill, carrying over a hundred pounds in one load. At that time, there was no job security. When the boss saw that business was good, he wanted us to do more, and when business was slow, he would kick us aside. One winter, the weather was particularly cold. Every morning, I would take my lunch and run to the mountains. When I was hungry, I would open my lunch bag, and the rice balls would be frozen into ice balls. I would crush the ice balls, put them in my mouth to melt, and then swallow them. One night, I braved the wind and snow to carry a load of thatch home. The mountain socks I was wearing were covered with a thick layer of ice, frozen to my feet, and I couldn't pull them off. My old mother poured warm water on my feet, and after a while, she gently took off the mountain socks. Both feet were red and swollen, and the toenails on all ten toes came off with the mountain socks! I should have rested for a few days, but the boss wanted me to carry pine branches again. To eat, I had to go. From that time on, the tendons in my feet were injured, and they would ache whenever the weather was about to turn bad..."
    "I understand!" Secretary Liu said, "The reason you lost the competition today is that reason. You should rest for a few days."
    "During the Great Leap Forward, all the pottery factories are waiting for clay, Secretary Liu, how can I rest?"
    "No matter what, you have to rest for a few days!" Secretary Liu said, walking out the door.
    Zhang Dahu rested for two days in a row. On the third day, he couldn't bear it anymore. He secretly walked towards the mining area, but he met Secretary Liu halfway.
    "Where are you going?" Secretary Liu stopped him: "Your current task is to rest well."
    "Secretary Liu, just let me carry a little less!"
    "Carrying less is not allowed, unless..."
    "Unless what?"
    "Unless you don't have to carry it on your shoulders."
    "Don't have to carry it on my shoulders!"
    From that day on, Zhang Dahu kept thinking about ways to avoid carrying loads on his shoulders. If you don't carry it on your shoulders, you have to use a cart, but to use a cart, you have to lay rails on the mountain. Where do these rails come from? He consulted with a few friends, and everyone felt that the rails were difficult to obtain.
    After the newspapers reported that pottery factories were using pottery instead of steel and making machines out of clay, Zhang Dahu thought:
    "If clay can make machines, it can certainly make rails!" Then he proposed the idea of using clay to make rails to Secretary Liu. Secretary Liu happily supported this proposal.
    The pottery rails were quickly made successfully in the pottery factory.
    The sun shines on Dragon Mountain, and the colorful pottery clay shines with brilliant colors. The mining workers are working hard to knock and dig the treasures on the mountain; the transportation workers are transporting the pottery clay to the factory. Under their feet, there are many long pottery tracks, the pottery rails are as strong as iron rails, and the flatbed carts with iron wheels, fully loaded with pottery clay, are speeding on them.
    Among the many transportation workers, there is a tall man wearing a willow hat and a towel around his neck, standing on the edge of a flatbed cart, speeding on the pottery rails. He is Zhang Dahu.

    采矿厂里运输一组工人张大虎，年龄在四十左右，个儿长得很高，站着就像一座山，两个宽肩膀，就好像铁打的一样。自从进厂以后，由于他挑得多，担得重，很快就使人佩服了。
    在这次红旗竞赛中，大虎一担挑了百来斤陶坭，从矿区走到陶器厂工区，约有两里多路，这样连续挑了五担，他一直是领先的。后来二组有个小伙子名叫小牛的，以更多的数字超过了他，而且张大虎一直掉在小牛后边。
    工人同志们都纷纷谈论起来：
    “大虎赛输了，不是别的原因，大概是今儿他吃饭吃得太多了！”
    “大老虎赛不过小牛，真有点说不过去。”
    厂里的党委刘书记在晚间休息的时候，亲自到工人宿舍来找张大虎。大虎把一双脚正浸在一盆温水里，他一看见刘书记来，慌忙地把脚拭了一下，站起来迎接。
    “有人说你今天竞赛输给小牛是吃得过多了，”刘书记坐下说：
    “是不是这个原因啊？”
    大虎给刘书记倒了一杯茶，笑了笑，说：“不是因为吃得太多，那是……”
    “你坐下谈吧！”
    “说起来话长，”大虎坐下来说：
    “我十六岁就在窑上当杂工，从河埠把松枝挑到窑岭上，一担能挑百来斤。那时做工一点保障都没有，老板见生意好的时候，就要我们多做，生意清淡的时候，就一脚把我们踢在一旁。有一年冬天，天气特别冷，我每天一早带了饭包就往山里奔。饿的时候，把饭包打开，饭团冻成冰球，把冰球敲碎了，送到嘴里化开冻，再咽下肚去。一天夜晚，冒着风雪挑了一担茅柴回家，脚上穿的山袜，结了一层厚冰，冻牢在脚上，扯都扯不开。老母亲用温水往我脚上浇，浇了一会，才把山袜轻轻地脱下来，原来两只脚冻得又红又肿，十个脚趾上的趾甲都跟着山袜脱下来了！本来应该好好歇几天的，可是老板又要我去挑松枝了。为了吃饭，我不能不去挑。就打那时起我的脚上的筋络受了伤，每逢天快阴的时候就发痛了，……”
    “我懂了！”刘书记说：“今天竞赛赛输了就是这原因，你该好好歇几天。”
    “在大跃进里，各个陶器厂都等着要坭，刘书记，我怎么能歇呢？”
    “无论怎么说，你得歇几天！”刘书记说着走出门去。
    张大虎一连歇了两天，到第三天，再也耐不住了，他偷偷地走向矿区去，可是走到半路，顶头遇到刘书记。
    “你到哪里去？”刘书记拦住他：“目前给你的任务，就是好好休歇？”
    “刘书记，你就让我去少挑一些吧！”
    “少挑也不行，除非……”
    “除非什么？”
    “除非不用肩挑。”
    “不用肩挑！”
    从那天起，张大虎的脑子里就老是在想着不用肩挑的办法：不用肩挑，就得用车子，可是山上要铺成轨道，车子才能行啊，这路轨从哪里来呢？他找几个朋友商量，大家都感到路轨难办。
    报上登出陶器厂用陶代钢、陶土做成机器的消息以后，张大虎想：
    “陶土能做机器，一定也能做路轨啊！”接着他就向刘书记提出用陶土造路轨的建议。刘书记高兴地支持了这个建议。
    陶轨很快就在陶器厂里做成功了。
    太阳照在龙山上，五颜六色的陶坭发着绚烂的光彩。采矿工人们在用力地敲着、挖着山上的宝藏；运输工人们在把陶坭运到工场去，在他们的脚下，铺展着好多条漫长的陶轨道，陶轨坚实得就像铁轨一样，铁轮子的四平车，满载着陶坭，在上面飞奔。
    在许多运输工人当中，有个高大的汉子，他戴着柳条帽，颈上围着毛巾，站在四平车的边沿上，在陶轨上疾驰着。他就是张大虎。
