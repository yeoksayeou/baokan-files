Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 9th: The first batch of twenty-two bureau and section-level cadres and three hundred division-chief-level cadres in Guangzhou this year have been sent down to factories, construction sites, or docks to work as laborers.

After arriving at their labor posts, these bureau and section-level cadres participated in physical labor as ordinary laborers. Some worked as fitters, some as road repair workers, and some as stevedores. In their work, they all abide by discipline, obey leadership, and work actively. After Xu Huaizhi, Director of the Guangzhou Postal Bureau, was sent down to the Transportation Section of the bureau to work as a porter, he helped a few workers solve ideological problems. After Cui Xianwu, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Port Authority, and Liao Yuanlu, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, were sent down to a loading and unloading team at Huangsha Wharf to work as stevedores, the workers were greatly encouraged, and the labor efficiency of this team has improved. The workers also enthusiastically introduced the production situation to the cadres sent down and taught them production technology. After Dai Ji, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Telecommunications Bureau, was sent down to the Telegraph Workshop of the bureau to work as a telegram delivery worker, he basically mastered the rules of telegram delivery in only two or three days thanks to the enthusiastic help of the workshop workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 9th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has successively sent down a batch of cadres to workshops and work sections this year to work as laborers.

After the cadres were sent down to the workshops and work sections, they labored and lived with the workers, became familiar with the production situation, and promptly discovered many problems in production. Fan Tingrui, Deputy Section Chief of the Production Planning Section, mingled with the workers in the stockyard and often conducted propaganda and explanations to the workers, making them realize the importance of improving stockyard management to improve steel quality. As a result, in a very short period of time, the workers classified and graded the pig iron in the stockyard, managing the stockyard in an orderly manner. Fan Tingrui also explored the experience of rectifying all the company's stockyards.

Xinhua News Agency: In the past year, the thirty-two leading cadres of the Laotougou Flax Factory in Yanji County, Jilin Province, have persisted in going to the workshops to participate in labor, thereby strengthening leadership, improving work, and allowing eight cadres, including the factory director and the Party General Branch Secretary, to reach the level of ordinary technical workers.

This factory began to implement the system of cadres participating in labor in March last year. The methods adopted were: cadres signed contracts with workshops, fixed labor objects, and stipulated three days of labor per week. After a year of labor training, the leading cadres learned production technology, became familiar with the production process, and were therefore able to discover new problems in production and guide workers to break through key production problems. In the past, flax stacking was always done manually, which was inefficient and unsafe. After the cadres who participated in labor worked with the workers to research, a flax stacking and transportation machine was made, which greatly improved labor efficiency. In the past year, these cadres discovered that some rules and regulations were unreasonable in their joint labor with the workers. After research by the leading cadres, the necessary revisions have been made based on the actual situation; at the same time, some new rules and regulations suitable for production needs have been established.

    以普通劳动者身分参加生产领导生产
    广州、重钢分别下放一批干部当工人  老头沟亚麻厂主要领导干部学会技术
    新华社广州9日电　广州市今年首批下放的二十二名局、处级干部和三百名科长级干部，已经分别到工厂、工地或码头当工人。
    这批局、处级干部到了劳动岗位后，以普通劳动者的身份参加体力劳动，他们有的当钳工、有的当修路工人，有的当搬运工人。他们在劳动中都能遵守纪律、服从领导、积极工作。广州市邮局局长徐化之下放到这个局的运输科当搬运工人后，帮助少数工人解决了思想问题。广州市港务局副局长崔宪武、党委副书记廖元绿下放到黄沙码头一个装卸班当装卸工人后，工人们受到很大的鼓舞，这个班的劳动效率已经有了提高。工人们还热情地向下放干部介绍生产情况，教给他们生产技术。广州市电讯局副局长戴机下放到局里的电报车间当递报工人后，由于车间工人的热心帮助，只两、三天就基本上掌握了递报的规律。
    据新华社重庆9日电　重庆钢铁公司今年陆续下放了一批干部到车间、工段当工人。
    干部下放到车间、工段以后，和工人同劳动、同生活，熟悉了生产情况，及时发现了不少生产上存在的问题。生产计划科副科长范廷瑞在料场参加劳动中，和工人打成一片，并经常向工人进行宣传、解释，使工人认识到改进料场管理对提高钢的质量的重要性，结果在很短时间内，工人们就对料场的生铁进行分类分级堆放，把料场管理得有条有理，范廷瑞也摸索到了整顿公司所有料场的经验。
    据新华社讯　吉林省延吉县老头沟亚麻厂的三十二名领导干部，在过去一年中坚持不懈地下车间参加劳动，从而加强了领导，改进了工作，并有厂长和党总支书记等八个干部达到了一般技术工人水平。
    这个厂从去年3月开始实行干部参加劳动的制度。采取的办法是：干部和车间订立合同、固定劳动对象和规定每周劳动三天。领导干部们经过一年劳动锻炼，学会了生产技术，熟悉了生产过程，因此也就能够发现生产中的新问题，引导工人突破生产关键问题。过去，亚麻堆垛一直用手工操作，效率低，不安全。经过参加劳动的干部和工人们一起研究，制成了亚麻堆垛运输机，就大大提高了劳动效率。这些干部一年来在和工人共同劳动中，发现了有些规章制度不合理，经过领导干部研究以后，已根据实际情况作了必要的修改；同时建立了一些适合生产需要的新的规章制度。（附图片）
