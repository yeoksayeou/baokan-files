    Transfer Steel to Support Key Projects
    Dalian Steel Plant Completes Plan on Schedule
    (Our newspaper reports) The Dalian Steel Plant completed the recent 1,300-ton steel transfer plan assigned by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry on time and with a surplus, providing strong support to key enterprises manufacturing rolling mills, power stations, and coking and coal washing equipment.
    After receiving the urgent task of supporting key enterprises, the plant promptly conducted in-depth ideological education on the "whole country as a single chessboard" for all employees and adopted effective measures to ensure the on-time completion of the task with the required varieties and guaranteed quality. When producing spring steel for units such as the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, they lacked ferrosilicon. They sent people out to seek help overnight. Once the ferrosilicon arrived, the steelmaking workers launched a crash program to smelt steel, and the rolling mill workers rushed to roll finished products. In less than a week, they completed this batch of urgent orders.
    During the delivery of this batch of steel, the transportation workers of Dalian Port and Railway and the sales personnel of Dalian Steel Plant cooperated, implementing reasonable distribution and fast loading and unloading despite the very tight other transportation tasks, ensuring timely delivery.

    调拨钢材支援重点
    大连钢厂按期完成计划
    本报讯　大连钢厂按时超额完成了最近冶金工业部布置的一千三百吨钢材调运计划，有力地支援了制造轧钢、电站和炼焦、洗煤设备的重点企业。
    这个厂在接到支援重点企业的紧急任务后，及时向全体职工深入地进行了“全国一盘棋”的思想教育，并采取了有效措施，保证了按品种、保质量如期完成任务。在为沈阳重型机器厂等单位生产弹簧钢的时候，缺少矽铁，他们就连夜派人向外求援，矽铁有了以后，炼钢工人突击炼钢，轧钢工人赶轧成品，先后不到一星期，就完成了这批紧急订货任务。
    在这批钢材发运过程中，大连海港、铁路的运输职工和大连钢厂运销人员协作，在其他运输任务十分紧张的情况下，实行合理配载，快装快运，作到了按时发货。
