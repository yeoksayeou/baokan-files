Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 22nd: The four-day Fourth National Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives of Czechoslovakia successfully concluded at noon on the 22nd. In a letter to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, the Congress pledged to basically complete the socialist transformation of the countryside within this year.

The meeting opened on the 19th. Attendees listened to the main report by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Štrougal, on that day, and then listened to a speech by the president of the Czechoslovak Republic and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotny, on the 20th.

Novotny pointed out the important significance of this Congress in terms of the victory of socialist relations of production in the countryside. He emphasized the need to continue establishing and expanding cooperatives, to deepen collectivized thinking in the minds of individual small and middle peasants, and thus quickly complete the collectivization of the countryside. He said that large-scale production is the main factor in eliminating the major differences between urban and rural areas.

Novotny said that in order to achieve a decisive change in agricultural production, conscious efforts are very important. The purpose of this effort is to further strengthen the political, economic, and organizational aspects of the cooperatives. He emphasized that it is necessary to raise the socialist consciousness of cooperative members while resolutely combating the remnants of individualism generated by small-scale production.

When talking about the issue of material interests, he said that in agricultural production, it is also entirely necessary to implement the socialist form of distribution, giving remuneration according to the quantity and quality of labor. He believes that new mechanization and new technology are another decisive factor in developing agricultural production. Decisive changes in agriculture also require deep and careful cultivation of the land, etc. He also requested that all those working in organizations and institutions related to agriculture participate in practical work in cooperatives and state farms as much as possible, and frequently provide opinions when making decisions on important agricultural issues.

During the discussion, more than fifty representatives spoke at the Congress. They unanimously supported the policies and measures of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government in agriculture, put forward many ambitious guarantees and useful suggestions, exchanged their achievements and experiences in production, and also made strict criticisms of the shortcomings in current work. Some also suggested launching a nationwide competition to strive for the highest yield per unit area of crops.

In their speeches, the representatives also universally requested that the public accumulation of cooperatives be increased from the original 7% to more than 10%, and pointed out that this is the correct path to consolidate and expand the socialist economy and make the cooperatives and their members prosperous.

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Štrougal made a concluding speech at the meeting on the morning of the 22nd. He pointed out that this Congress is an important milestone for Czechoslovakia in developing socialist agriculture, and pointed out the significance of strengthening ideological education of cooperative members, so as to combine improving agricultural production with raising the political consciousness of peasants.

The Congress finally passed a resolution. The resolution stated that Czechoslovakia's task in agriculture is to concentrate all efforts on developing large-scale socialist agricultural production, and to ensure the completion of the production increase targets and requirements put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the recent plenary session of the Party Central Committee. The resolution said that achieving a decisive increase in crop production and forming its own feed base are the direction of future efforts of the cooperatives. To this end, on the one hand, it is necessary to make full use of agricultural land, and at the same time, it is necessary to improve the fertility of the land.

The resolution also emphasized the importance of adopting large-scale production methods of division of labor and cooperation in animal husbandry production, paying attention to increasing the public accumulation of cooperatives, and vigorously improving the technical level of cooperative members and their love for agricultural labor.

The Congress also unanimously passed suggestions for supplementing and amending the cooperative charter.

Agricultural delegations from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union who were invited to participate in the Congress, as well as representatives of agricultural organizations from other countries, all delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. The Congress also received congratulatory telegrams from Chinese Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    统一农业合作社代表大会向党和政府提出保证
    捷今年基本完成农村社会主义改造
    诺沃提尼在会上强调必须提高合作社社员社会主义觉悟
    新华社布拉格22日电　历时四天的捷克斯洛伐克第四届全国统一农业合作社代表大会22日中午胜利闭幕。大会在给捷共中央和政府的信中提出，保证在今年内基本完成农村的社会主义改造。
    会议是在19日开幕的，到会者在当天听取了农林部长什特劳加尔的主要报告后，20日又听取了捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼的讲话。
    诺沃提尼指出了这次代表大会在农村中社会主义生产关系获得胜利方面的重要意义。他着重指出，有必要继续建立和扩大合作社，使合作化思想深入个体小农和中农的心，从而很快完成农村的集体化。他说，大生产是消除城乡之间重大差别的主要因素。
    诺沃提尼说，为了实现农业生产方面的有决定意义的改变，目的在于使合作社的政治、经济和组织方面进一步得到增强的自觉的努力是很重要的。他强调指出在对小生产所产生的个人主义残余进行坚决斗争时，必须提高合作社社员社会主义觉悟。
    他在谈到物质利益问题时说，在农业生产方面，也完全有必要实行按照劳动数量和质量给予报酬的社会主义分配形式。他认为新的机械化和新的技术是发展农业生产的另一个有决定性的因素。农业方面的决定性的改变也要求土地的深耕细作等。他还要求，所有那些在同农业有关的组织和机构中工作的人尽可能地在合作社和国营农场中参加实际工作，并且在对重要的农业问题作出决定的时候经常提供意见。
    在讨论中，有五十多位代表在大会上发了言，他们一致拥护捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府在农业方面的政策和措施，提出了许多豪迈的保证和有益的建议，交流了他们在生产中的成就和经验，同时也对当前工作中的缺点进行了严格的批评。有的还建议在全国范围内开展争取农作物最高单位面积产量的竞赛。
    代表们在发言中还普遍要求将合作社的公共积累由原有的7％提高到10％以上，并指出这是巩固和扩大社会主义经济，使合作社和社员富裕的正确道路。
    农林部长什特劳加尔在22日上午的会议上作了总结发言。他指出，这次代表大会是捷克斯洛伐克在发展社会主义农业中的一个重要里程碑，并且指出了加强对社员的思想教育，以便使提高农业生产和提高农民政治觉悟相结合的意义。
    大会最后通过了一项决议。决议说，捷克斯洛伐克在农业方面的任务是，集中一切力量发展社会主义农业大生产，保证完成捷共第十一次代表大会和最近党中央全会所提出的增产指标和要求。决议说，在农作物的生产上取得决定性的提高和形成自己的饲料基地是合作社今后努力的方向。为此，一方面需要充分利用农业用地，同时需要提高土地的肥沃程度。
    决议还着重指出了在畜牧业生产中采用分工协作的大生产方法，注意提高合作社的公共积累以及大力提高社员的技术水平和对农业劳动的热爱的重要性。
    大会还一致通过了对合作社章程的补充和修改的建议。
    应邀参加大会的苏联等兄弟国家的农业代表团以及其他国家农业组织的代表都先后在会上致了贺词。大会还收到中国农业部长廖鲁言和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的贺电。
