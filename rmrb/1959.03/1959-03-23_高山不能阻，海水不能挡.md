    High Mountains Cannot Stop, Seas Cannot Block
    An Bo
    "South Vietnam is our bone of our bones, flesh of our flesh. Our determination to unify our country cannot be stopped by high mountains, nor blocked by the seas!"
    This is what President Ho Chi Minh said in his New Year's greetings to the people in 1957. After hearing about the heinous massacre committed by the US imperialists and their lackey Ngo Dinh Diem in Phu Loi, South Vietnam, I remembered these words again. That year, I spent the Spring Festival in Hanoi with Vietnamese friends, together with many comrades who had gathered in the North from South Vietnam. When we talked about the South, those comrades who inherited the heroic spirit of the South Vietnamese people all said:
    "Yes, we have relatives in South Vietnam, and our relatives are far more than just these. The brothers of the entire socialist camp are our relatives, and with the mutual comfort and help of so many relatives, one day we will be reunited with our relatives in our hometowns!"
    These words resonate particularly strongly in my ears today!
    The US-Ngo clique's executioners want to use cannibalistic means to stop the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their country, but they will never succeed!
    In 1957, I traveled in central Vietnam. On the north bank of the Ben Hai River, the temporary military demarcation line between North and South Vietnam, I heard several folk songs popular in the South:
    "Who divided the motherland,
    Who divided the family,
    Who must pay the price!
    No matter when, never violate
    One's own oath:
    Money is useless,
    Force cannot subdue!"
    "I love the peace fighters who sacrificed for the motherland,
    I hate the wicked elements who launched the war,
    Sister swears to the motherland:
    Never let honor be stained with dust!"
    These poems were recited to the people by an old farmer who had escaped from the south bank of the Ben Hai River. In front of a thatched cottage, under several swaying banana trees, I met this white-haired old man with many Vietnamese villagers. When everyone asked about the situation on the other side of the river, he first covered his face with convulsing hands and burst into tears. After a long while, he began his accusations:
      "I have two sons. The elder one sacrificed during the War of Resistance, and his daughter-in-law and three children were also killed by the enemy. My second son fishes on this side of the river. For this reason alone, Ngo Dinh Diem launched three 'anti-communist campaigns' and arrested me for reflection. The so-called reflection is torture to extract confessions. After forcing it out, people with father-son relationships with the North have to sever their relationship, and people with marital relationships have to divorce and remarry, otherwise their land will be confiscated and they will have no food to eat... The first and second times I was beaten half to death by them. This third time, I said I couldn't bear it anymore! That day, taking advantage of the fact that they were escorting us out and walking to the Ben Hai River, I rushed out of the ranks and jumped into the water. They thought I had committed suicide by jumping into the river... I felt like I had entered heaven when I got here, but unfortunately, I left an old wife over there. How can she survive?"
      "How is it over there recently?" several young people asked eagerly.
      "Alas, it's impossible to survive!" the old man sighed, and continued, "There are so many taxes: land tax, head tax—these have to be paid four times a year! Officials' drinking and banquets are all borne by the farmers; in addition, there are Buddhist fees, and after being forced to participate in the 'National Revolutionary Movement' organization, they have to pay movement fees... Not to mention, people are not allowed to go out after seven o'clock every night, they force every household to build a fence, and two people cannot meet! All those between the ages of eighteen and fifty have to stand guard at night, and anyone who doesn't go will be said to be pro-communist and dangerous... Now they often grab young men to be soldiers at night, making people unable to sleep peacefully! Across the river from the demilitarized zone is a large military camp, where American devils also live!"
    He said that the people of the South all yearn for the North, yearning for the liberated land of the North. The "Unification Brand" matchboxes and "Thang Long Brand" cigarette boxes produced in Hanoi have become the most precious things once they are passed over there, and people scramble to secretly watch them, and some even offer high prices to buy and keep them. A farmer brought back a large papaya from the north bank of the river, and he displayed it at home specifically for people to admire...
    "They are afraid that the people will run to this side, so they have erected barbed wire on the river bank, prohibiting people from washing clothes by the river, and even more so from taking boats or rafts," the old man said.
    However, he forgot that he himself had run over from there.
    After hearing his accusations, everyone gnashed their teeth. A young man jumped up and said:
      "No matter how fierce and evil the US imperialists and Ngo Dinh Diem are, they cannot stop our determination to unify our country! Nor can they stop the people from supporting the Workers' Party and Uncle Ho!"
    This is the common voice of the people on both sides of the Ben Hai River, the common voice of the 25 million people from Con Lon Island to Dong Deng!
    Ngo Dinh Diem uses the most despicable and shameless means to massacre unarmed patriots who have already been imprisoned by them. What can this mean? Isn't it proof that they are at the end of their rope and exhausted all their tricks! What can they get besides owing the Vietnamese people a debt of blood?
    Dear Vietnamese brothers: The blood of the martyrs of Phu Loi and all Vietnamese patriots will not be shed in vain. It will irrigate the beautiful land of Vietnam, it will surely bear the fruits of peace, unity, and freedom, and the doomsday of imperialism and its running dogs is getting closer and closer!
    In 1957, I personally saw two different flags standing on both sides of the Ben Hai River: one was Ngo Dinh Diem's: yellow, dim, and drooping low (originally there was also a French flag! Later, Ngo Dinh Diem took it down to make it easier to quibble and cover up shame); the other was the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's: bright red, radiant, and flying high in the wind. In order to admire this flag, there are people who have come from dozens of miles away specifically. They feel proud as soon as they see this red flag with a gold star, and they have expressed their heartfelt wishes to the government: "Raise this gold-star flag higher and higher!"
    Yes, this red flag shining with a gold star will rise higher and higher, so that all twelve million people in the South can see it. High mountains cannot stop it, and the seas cannot block it!

    高山不能阻，海水不能挡
    安波
    “越南南部是我们的骨中之骨，肉中之肉。我们统一祖国的决心，高山不能阻，海水不能挡！”
    这是胡志明主席在1957年春节向人们致祝辞中说的话。当我听到了美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳在南越的富利制造了令人发指的惨案以后，我又想起了这句话。那年春节，我在河内同越南朋友们一起，同许多从越南南部集结到北方来的同志一起，欢度良宵。当我们说到南方的时候，那些继承了南越人民豪迈气概的同志们都说：
    “是的，南越有我们的亲人，而我们的亲人却绝不止这些。整个社会主义阵营的弟兄都是我们的亲人，凭着这么多亲人的互慰互助，终将有一天，我们要与家乡的亲人团聚的！”
    这些话在今天特别地响在我的耳际！
    美吴集团的刽子手们想以生番吃人的手段阻止越南人民统一祖国的斗争是万万办不到的！
    1957年，我曾在越南中部旅行。在越南北部和南部的临时军事分界线边海河北岸，我听到几首流行在南部的民歌：
    “谁分割了祖国，
    谁分割了家庭，
    谁就要偿罪！
    不论何时，决不违背
    自己的誓言：
    金钱没有用，
    威武不能屈！”
    “我爱和平战士为祖国牺牲，
    我恨奸恶分子发动战争，
    妹妹向祖国宣誓：
    决不能让荣誉沾上灰尘！”
    这几首诗是一位从边海河南岸逃过来的老农念给人们听的。在一幢茅屋门前，几株婆娑的芭蕉树下，我与许多越南老乡一起会见了这位须发皆白的老人。当大家问到河那边的情形时，他先是用痉挛的双手捂着脸失声痛哭起来，半晌才开始了他的控诉：
      “我有两个儿子，大的在抗战时牺牲了，他的媳妇跟三个孩子也被敌人杀死了；我的二孩子在河这边打渔。就是因为这个缘故，吴庭艳三次发动“肃共运动”把我抓了去反省。所谓反省就是拷打口供。逼问出来以后，与北方有父子关系要断绝关系，有夫妇关系的要离婚改嫁，否则就没收土地，就没有饭吃……第一、二次我被他们打得死去活来，这第三次我说什么再也不能忍受了！那一天，趁着他们押着我们出来走到边海河边的时候，我一个箭步跑出队伍，跳进了水里。他们以为我投河自尽了……我到了这边就好像进了天堂，只可惜那边还留下一个老伴，她怎么能活下去呀？”
      “那边最近怎么样啊？”几个青年争着问。
      “唉，活不下去呀？”老人长叹一声，继续说：“捐税那么多：土地税、人头税——这每年要交四次！官员们吃酒请客都要由庄稼人负担；此外还有什么佛学费，被迫着参加了‘国家革命运动’的组织以后还要交什么运动费……这且不说，每到晚上七点钟就不让出门了，他们强迫每家都修一个篱笆，两个人碰头也不行！十八岁以上五十岁以下的全要在夜里站岗，谁要不去就说是亲共、危险分子……现在他们抓壮丁当兵常常是夜里抓呀，闹得人们再也睡不安稳觉了！过了河那边一出非军事区就是一个大兵营，里面还住着美国鬼子呢！”
    他说，南部人民人人向往着北方，向往着北部解放了的土地。河内出品的“统一牌”火柴盒与“升龙牌”纸烟盒一传到那边都成了最珍贵的东西，人们争着秘密地传看，甚至有人出高价收买保存起来。一位农民从河北岸弄回去一个大木瓜，他摆在家里专门供人观赏……
    “他们怕人民往这边跑，在河岸上架起了铁丝网，禁止人们到河边洗衣服，乘船、渡筏就更不允许了。”老汉说。
    然而，他忘了自己就是从那边跑过来的。
    人们听了他的控诉以后，个个咬牙切齿。一位青年跳起来说：
      “美帝和吴庭艳再凶再恶也不能阻止我们统一祖国的决心！也不能制止人民拥护劳动党与胡伯伯！”
    这就是越南边海河两岸人民的共同声音，从昆仑岛到同登两千五百万人民的共同声音！
    吴庭艳用最卑鄙最无耻的手段屠杀手无寸铁的已被他们监禁起来的爱国者，这能意味着什么呢？难道不是证明他们正是日暮途穷、黔驴技穷了么！他们除了欠下越南人民一笔血债以外，又能得到什么呢？
    亲爱的越南兄弟们：富利的烈士们和所有越南爱国者的鲜血是不会白流的。它将灌溉越南美丽的国土，它必将结出和平、统一、自由的果实，而帝国主义及其走狗们的末日却越来越近了！
    1957年，我曾亲眼看到边海河两岸立着两面不同的旗帜：一面是吴庭艳的：黄、灰暗、低落地下垂着（原先还有一面法国旗呢！后来吴庭艳为了便于狡赖遮羞把它取下来了）；另一面是越南民主共和国的：鲜红、光彩、高高地迎风飘荡。为了瞻仰这面旗，有从几十里路以外特意赶来的人民。他们一见到这面金星红旗就感到自豪，他们纷纷向政府提出衷心愿望：“把这面金星旗竖得更高更高吧！”
    是的，这面闪耀着金星的红旗，将会越升越高，让整个南部一千二百万人民都能看到。高山不能阻，海水不能挡！
