    Ushering in a High Tide of Socialist Agricultural Production
    By our correspondents Yang Yi and Lin Hai
    A Significant Meeting
    It is early spring in March, and on the vast fields of Czechoslovakia, farmers have begun cultivating the newly thawed land. This spring is a favorable one with timely rain. As a result, spring plowing here is almost a month earlier than last year. When you walk in the countryside of Czechoslovakia and see the black soil, plowed deeply and thoroughly by machines, you will naturally feel the joy of a promising harvest, just like the Czechoslovak farmers. The task of increasing agricultural production by 12.3% this year, proposed by the Czechoslovak Communist Party, encourages Czechoslovak agricultural laborers. More than six thousand agricultural cooperatives and most state farms have pledged to complete the production increase targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) a year ahead of schedule.
    Farmers are also clearly aware of the more arduous tasks ahead of them, namely, to increase agricultural production by 40% by 1965 compared to 1957, and to basically complete the socialist transformation of the entire rural area by next year at the latest. This is a grand plan. In order to promote its smooth implementation, the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee has called for thorough discussions, the formulation of concrete measures, and the mobilization of the entire party and the entire people to go all out. The Fourth National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives of Czechoslovakia, which opened on March 19, will carefully discuss the tasks for agriculture put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, formulate measures to complete these tasks, and determine the path to complete the socialist construction of the countryside in the shortest possible time.
    This National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives is receiving great attention from the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the entire working people, and not without reason. At present, agricultural production in Czechoslovakia has not kept pace with the rapid growth of industrial production, thus affecting the further upsurge of the national economy. Therefore, Comrade Krutina, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, said in his report to the Central Committee plenary session in early March that it is now necessary to fundamentally solve some decisive issues in the development of socialist agriculture.
    Preparations for the Fourth National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives began in the second half of last year. All cooperative members and farmers across the country conducted extensive mass discussions on issues such as increasing agricultural production, consolidating the cooperative economy, and completing the rural cultural revolution.
    Tributes to the Congress
    Reporters recently attended some cooperative annual meetings and agricultural cooperative county representative meetings held to welcome the National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives. At these meetings, members and farmers who have not yet joined the cooperatives discussed the measures on agricultural production issued by the Party and the government, put forward a large number of useful suggestions, and also proposed many new socialist guarantees. Now, 6,500 agricultural cooperatives across the country have pledged to complete the task of increasing agricultural production by 28% as stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In Slovakia, farmers put forward more than 20,000 suggestions for tapping potential to increase agricultural production, and also put forward more than 5,000 collective or individual guarantees to engage in agricultural production and capital construction better, so as to develop the cooperative economy. Members of the Hradec Králové region put forward 1,200 rationalization proposals related to fertilizer accumulation, etc.
    90% of the suggestions made in this discussion were solved in a timely manner, put into practice, or included in the annual plan of the cooperative.
    This discussion also greatly increased the farmers' interest in collective management. Many members took the initiative to increase the public accumulation of the cooperative to 10%, and many individual farmers also joined the cooperative during the discussion. For example, in the Presov region of eastern Czechoslovakia, the economy is relatively underdeveloped, and farmers have been more hesitant to accept new lifestyles in the past. However, 55 new agricultural cooperatives were established in this discussion.
    Increasing Crop Yields
    Crop yield is the basis of the entire agricultural production. In order to reverse the current situation that food products are not self-sufficient and animal husbandry relies on imported feed, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has decided to first pay attention to increasing the yield per unit area and the amount of livestock products per hectare of land. The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party requires that the national average wheat yield reach 2.7 tons per hectare, rye 2.5 tons, and barley 2.65 tons by 1965. This will ensure that at least 17.5 tons of meat, 73,000 liters of milk, and 40,700 eggs are produced per 100 hectares of farmland.
    In order to complete this task, the policy of the Czechoslovak Communist Party is to make full use of the existing arable land, while vigorously increasing the fertility of the land, and taking a series of measures to improve the soil, such as drainage, irrigation, and fertilizer accumulation. It is expected that by 1965, water conservancy projects will be built on more than 260,000 hectares of land.
    Expanding the feed base is also one of the current central tasks. The area of feed crops will increase from the current 26% of the country's cultivated land to 30%, in order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in feed.
    Accelerating the Mechanization of Production
    Czechoslovakia's strong industry has created good conditions for the mechanization of agriculture. In particular, the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement has made it possible to use machines on a large scale. The Czech countryside has fertile land, but the labor force, especially the young and middle-aged labor force, is relatively scarce. A reporter recently visited the Weierjie Agricultural Cooperative in the northern suburbs of Prague. The average age of the members there is 55 years old, and there are 38 women among the 54 members. This situation is quite common in the Czech countryside. Therefore, further strengthening the mechanization of the countryside has become one of the important ways to increase agricultural production. The Central Committee and the government of the Czechoslovak Communist Party attach great importance to this issue and have taken many measures to increase investment in agricultural machinery production. For example, the number of tractors received by the countryside this year will increase by 30% compared with last year. In addition, new machines and farm tools will be directly supplied to agricultural cooperatives in the future. The 51,000 tractors and other agricultural machines currently owned by machine and tractor stations will also be gradually sold to cooperatives in the next two years. From the eagerness of cooperatives everywhere to purchase machines recently, it can be seen how much interest and enthusiasm the farmers have for this new and important measure. As of the beginning of March, cooperatives have purchased nearly 4,000 tractors. In the Pardubice region, more than half of the cooperatives have purchased agricultural machinery. Many members happily drove their own tractors for the first time to carry out this year's spring plowing.
    Specialization and Collaboration
    Agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia often have only dozens of members and engage in diversified operations on nearly 100 hectares of land. In this case, the advantages of large-scale socialist agricultural production are often limited. In order to change this situation and further improve agricultural labor productivity, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has decided to implement the specialization and regionalization of agricultural production, so that state farms and cooperatives can strive to develop the production departments that are most suitable for their own characteristics, and rely on cooperation and adjustment between cooperatives to concentrate crop and animal husbandry production on a larger scale.
    Cooperation between agricultural cooperatives is gradually being strengthened, such as organizing the strength of some neighboring cooperatives to jointly improve the soil, repair roads, and purchase various large-scale machinery and equipment. Six agricultural cooperatives in the Pilsen region have decided to carry out division of labor and collaboration in production. The Czechoslovak Communist Party also pays attention to restricting the expansion of private plot economy, and educates members to correctly combine the interests of individuals, cooperatives, and the state.
    The Whole Party and the Whole People Run Agriculture
    "Vigorously increasing agricultural production is one of the important tasks of the whole party and the whole people." This is the call put forward by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in early March. The 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party has set huge tasks for agricultural production. By 1965, the Czechoslovak people will receive 61 kilograms of meat, 235 kilograms of milk and dairy products, 210 eggs, and 123 kilograms of flour every year. This task requires agricultural production to move forward at a rapid pace, and requires the whole party and the whole people to care about and support agricultural production.
    In the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production in Czechoslovakia, the people of the whole country have always regarded supporting agricultural production as a noble obligation. During the busy seasons of spring plowing and autumn harvest or other agricultural seasons, a large number of workers, soldiers, students, and staff members work with farmers in the fields. Many factories and cooperatives have signed mutual assistance contracts to help members produce and carry out construction with voluntary labor. Workers also pass on their experience in political and organizational work to their farmer brothers. Many factories also send outstanding workers to specialize in helping backward cooperatives. Not long ago, 614 party cadres in the Ostrava region went to work in some backward agricultural areas. After two months of hard work, with their help, these originally backward cooperatives have all caught up.
    Under the call of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party recently put forward to further accelerate agricultural development, party organizations in various places have strengthened their leadership over agricultural production, gone deep into cooperatives and state farms, and given greater play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Socialist competitions have been launched in the countryside, and communist ideological education for farmers has been strengthened. The Party and the government have decided to send more agricultural experts to the countryside in the future, and to make agricultural managers as close to production as possible. At the same time, they also support cooperatives to send more farmers to study at schools.
    Marching toward agricultural production has become one of the important tasks for the Czechoslovak people to complete socialist construction. The Party has issued a loud battle call for this. From the preparations for the Fourth National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives, the heroic response of the Czechoslovak people has been heard: We must promote the arrival of a high tide of socialist agricultural production.

    迎接社会主义农业生产的高潮
    本报记者　杨翊　林海
    意义重大的会
    正是早春3月，在捷克斯洛伐克辽阔的田野上，农民已在刚刚解冻的土地上开始了耕种。今年春天是一个雨顺风调的好春天。因此，这里的春耕几乎比去年提早了一个月。当你走在捷克斯洛伐克的农村中，看到那被机器翻犁得又深又透的黑土，就会同捷克斯洛伐克的农民一样，心头自然地涌起丰收有望的喜悦。捷共提出的今年农业增产12.3％的任务鼓舞着捷克斯洛伐克的农业劳动者。有六千多个农业合作社和大部分国营农场提出保证，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960）所规定的增产指标。
    农民们也清楚地看到了摆在他们面前的更加艰巨的任务，即到1965年农业生产要比1957年增长40％以及至迟明年要基本完成全国农村的社会主义改造。这是一项宏伟的计划，为了促进它的顺利实现，捷共中央号召进行透彻的讨论，拟定具体的措施，动员全党全民全力以赴。3月19日开幕的捷农业合作社第四届全国代表大会，将仔细讨论捷共第十一次代表大会为农业提出的任务，要拟定完成这些任务的措施，制定在最短时期内完成农村的社会主义建设的途径。
    这一届农业合作社全国代表大会，受到捷共与全体劳动人民的极大重视，并不是没有原因的。目前捷农业生产还跟不上工业生产增长的迅速步伐，因而影响到国民经济的进一步高涨。因此，捷共中央书记克鲁蒂纳同志在3月初捷共中央全会的报告中说，现在要从根本上解决社会主义农业发展上的一些决定性问题。
    从去年下半年起，就着手准备第四届全国农业合作社代表大会的召开了，全体合作社员和全国农民就提高农业生产、巩固合作社经济和完成农村文化革命等项问题，进行了广泛的群众性的讨论。
    向大会献礼
    记者最近参加了一些为迎接农业合作社全国代表大会而召开的合作社年会和农业合作社县代表会议。在这些会议上，社员们同还未入社的农民一齐讨论了党和政府颁发的关于农业生产方面的措施，提出了大批有益的建议，同时也提出了许多新的社会主义保证。现在全国已有六千五百个农业合作社保证提前一年完成第二个五年计划规定的农业增产28％的任务。在斯洛伐克，农民们提出了二万多个发掘潜力增加农业生产的建议，还提出了五千多项集体的或者是个人的保证，要更好地从事农业生产和基本建设，以发展合作社经济。赫腊德茨州的社员们提出了一千二百项有关积肥等的合理化建议。
    这次讨论中提出的建议，90％都及时得到解决，付诸实施，或订入了合作社的年度计划中。
    这次讨论也大大提高了农民对集体经营的兴趣。许多社员主动提出把合作社的公共积累提高到10％，还有许多个体农户也在讨论过程中加入了合作社。如捷克斯洛伐克东部的普雷郊夫州，经济比较不发达，农民们过去对接受新的生活方式比较犹豫。但在这一次讨论中也新建立了五十五个农业合作社。
    提高农作物产量
    农作物产量是整个农业生产的基础。为了扭转当前粮食产品还不能自给和畜牧业依靠输入饲料的情况，捷共决定首先注意提高单位面积的产量和每公顷土地上畜类产品的数量。捷共中央要求在1965年时全国平均的小麦产量达到每公顷二点七吨，黑麦二点五吨，大麦二点六五吨。这样才能保证每一百公顷农地上至少生产十七点五吨肉、七万三千公升牛奶和四万零七百个鸡蛋。
    为了完成这项任务，捷共的方针是充分利用现有的可耕土地，同时大力提高土地的肥沃程度，采取排水、灌溉、积肥等一系列改良土壤的措施。预计到1965年时，将在二十六万多公顷的土地上建设起水利工程。
    扩大饲料基地也是当前的中心任务之一。饲料种植面积将由目前占全国耕地26％增加到30％，以逐步实现饲料的自给自足。
    加速生产的机械化
    捷克斯洛伐克的强大工业给农业的机械化创造了良好的条件，特别是农业合作化运动的迅速发展，更使得大规模的使用机器成为可能。捷农村有着富饶的土地，但是劳动力特别是青壮年劳动力却比较缺乏。日前记者访问了布拉格北郊的维尔杰农业合作社。那里社员平均年龄是五十五岁，五十四个社员中有三十八个妇女，这种情况在捷农村中是相当普遍的。因此进一步加强农村机械化，就成为提高农业生产的重要途径之一。捷共中央和政府十分重视这一问题，曾采取了许多措施来提高对农业机器生产的投资，例如今年农村得到的拖拉机将比去年增加30％。此外，今后新的机器和农具将直接供应农业合作社。现在的机器与拖拉机站所拥有的五万一千台拖拉机等农业机器，也将在今后二年内逐步转卖给合作社。从最近各地合作社涌跃购买机器的情况可以看出，农民对这一新的重要措施怀着多么大的兴趣和热情。到3月初为止，合作社已购买了近四千台拖拉机。巴杜比泽州就有半数以上的合作社购买了农业机器。许多社员兴高采烈地第一次驾驶着合作社自己的拖拉机进行了今年的春耕工作。
    专业化和协作
    捷克斯洛伐克的农业合作社，常常是只有几十个社员，并在近百公顷的土地上进行着多种经营。在这种情况下，社会主义农业大生产优越性的发挥，每每受到限制。为了改变这种状况，进一步提高农业劳动生产率，捷共决定实行农业生产的专业化和区域化，使国营农场和合作社都尽力发展最适合自己特长的生产部门，并依靠合作社之间的协作和调济，使农作物和畜牧业生产都能在更大的范围内集中起来。
    农业合作社之间的合作正在逐步加强。如组织相邻的一些合作社力量共同改良土壤，维修道路以及购买各种大型的机器设备。比尔森州有六个农业合作社决定在生产方面进行分工和协作。捷共还注意限制自留地经济的扩大，并教育社员将个人、合作社和国家的利益正确地结合起来。
    全党全民办农业
    “大力提高农业生产是全党全民的重要任务之一。”这是3月初捷共中央全会提出的号召。捷共十一大给农业生产规定了巨大的任务，到1965年时，捷克斯洛伐克人民每年将得到六十一公斤肉，二百三十五公斤牛奶和乳类食品，二百一十个鸡蛋和一百二十三公斤面粉等。这个任务要求农业生产以快速的步伐前进，要求全党全民都来关心和支援农业生产。
    在捷克斯洛伐克的农业合作化运动和农业生产中，全国人民一贯把支援农业生产作为自己一项崇高的义务。在春耕秋收或其他农忙的季节，大批工人、战士、学生、职员等在田野里和农民一起劳动，许多工厂和合作社订立了互助合同，以义务劳动帮助社员生产和进行修建。工人们也把自己关于政治和组织工作的经验传授给农民弟兄。许多工厂还派遣优秀工人去专门帮助落后的合作社。不久前，俄斯特拉发州就有六百一十四个党的干部到一些落后的农业地区去工作。经过他们两个月的辛勤劳动，在他们的帮助下，这些原来落后的合作社已经都赶上来了。
    在捷共中央最近提出的进一步加速农业发展的号召下，各地的党组织都加强了对农业生产的领导，深入到合作社和国营农场去，更大地发挥了群众的积极性。在农村中展开了社会主义竞赛，加强了对农民的共产主义思想教育。党和政府决定今后要输送更多的农业专家到农村去，并使农业管理人员尽量接近生产。同时还支持合作社选派更多的农民到学校学习。
    向农业生产进军已经成为捷克斯洛伐克人民完成社会主义建设的重要任务之一。党已经为此发出了响亮的战斗号召。从第四届农业合作社全国代表大会的准备工作中，已经听到捷克斯洛伐克人民豪迈的回答：一定要促进社会主义农业生产高潮的到来。（附图片）
