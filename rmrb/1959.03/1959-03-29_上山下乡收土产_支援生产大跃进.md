    Report from our newspaper: Since last winter, commercial departments in various regions have closely centered their work around the people's communes to develop diverse economic undertakings, vigorously carrying out the procurement of small local products. According to statistics from Hebei Province from December 1st of last year to the end of February this year, the total output value of local and sideline products reached over 400 million yuan, and the total procurement value reached over 124 million yuan (including some non-staple foods and waste products). The main local products include reed mats, saltpeter, reed screens, osier strips, crude sodium sulfate, alkaline soil, various tool handles, straw braid, wild plant fibers, wild plant oilseeds, and cotton stalk skins. In Zhejiang Province, which is rich in moso bamboo, the province had purchased 6.45 million moso bamboo poles by March 20th. By the end of February, Hubei Province had purchased more than 1,300 dan of palm fiber. By March 15th, Changchun City, Jilin Province, had purchased more than 2,600 tons of reeds, 84,000 reed mats, 168,000 soil baskets, and 221,000 straw sacks. These items are currently in great demand in industrial and agricultural production or basic construction.

    In the procurement of local products, commercial departments in various regions have, based on local resources and production conditions, assisted the people's communes in formulating plans for developing diverse economic production, restoring and developing original production, and finding new avenues for production. Through production and sales contracts, they have linked the production of the people's communes with the state's procurement plans, thereby greatly promoting the development of commodity production and strengthening the planned nature of commodity production. According to statistics from Longchang County, Sichuan Province, by the beginning of February, the county's commercial bureau had signed 110 contracts with 23 people's communes throughout the county. The contract system more effectively promoted the development of the diverse economies of the people's communes in a planned manner. In two months, the county's small local products reached more than 2.1 million pieces. Small items such as soil dustpans, brooms, and pot scrubbers alone increased the income of the communes by more than 50,000 yuan. At the same time, in the procurement of small local products, commercial departments in various regions also actively provided strong support to the people's communes in terms of raw materials, technology, and funds. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce has also helped the people's communes establish many small factories for comprehensive utilization of aromatic oils, wood flour, pine wax, tannin extract, alkaline soil, artificial fiberboard, and charcoal.

    In order to further promote the procurement of small local products, the Ministry of Commerce convened a national conference on local products and waste materials, determined this year's procurement tasks for local products, and requested that various regions launch a high tide of small local product procurement through materials exchange fairs.

    上山下乡收土产　支援生产大跃进
    本报讯　去冬以来，各地商业部门紧密地围绕着人民公社开展多种经济经营，大力开展了小土产采购工作。河北省从去年12月1日到今年2月底统计，土副产品生产总值达四亿多元，收购总值达一亿二千四百多万元（包括部分副食品、废品）。其中主要土产有苇席、火硝、苇箔、荆柳条、皮硝、土碱、各种工具把、草帽辫、野生植物纤维、野生植物油料、棉秆皮等。盛产毛竹的浙江省，到3月20日，全省已收购毛竹六百四十五万根。湖北省到2月底已收购棕片一千三百多担。吉林省长春市到3月15日，已收购芦苇二千六百多吨，苇席八万四千多条，土篮子十六万八千多副，草袋子二十二万一千多条。这些东西都是目前工农业生产或基本建设中非常需要的。
    在土产采购中，各地商业部门都根据当地的资源和生产条件，帮助人民公社制定了发展多种经济生产规划，恢复与发展了原有生产，寻找到新的生产门路，并通过产销合同，将人民公社的生产与国家的收购计划衔接起来，因而大大地促进了商品生产的发展，加强了商品生产的计划性。四川省隆昌县到2月上旬统计，县商业局与全县二十三个人民公社签订了一百一十份合同，通过合同制更有计划地促进了人民公社的多种经济的发展。这个县两个月中小土产生产达二百一十多万件，仅土箕、扫把、洗锅把等小东西，就为公社增加收入五万多元。同时在小土产采购中，各地商业部门还积极地在原料、技术、资金等方面，给予人民公社有力的支持。四川省商业厅还帮助人民公社建立芳香油、木粉、松腊、栲胶、土碱、人造纤维板、木炭综合利用等许多小型工厂。
    为了进一步推动小土产的采购工作，商业部召开了全国土产废品会议，确定了今年土产的采购任务，并要求各地通过物资交流会，掀起一个小土产采购高潮。（附图片）
