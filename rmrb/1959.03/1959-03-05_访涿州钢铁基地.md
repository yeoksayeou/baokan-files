Visiting the Zhuozhou Steel Base
By our correspondent Fang Chen

	A Completely New Look
    In early February, I took a train north to Zhuozhou Town.

    I had visited this town during those days of vigorously developing the steel industry last year. After a lapse of more than two months, I came here again, but it has developed from a group of small, smoky, earthen steel furnaces into a group of small, modern furnaces.

    From Zhuozhou Station to the old city is about half a kilometer. From a distance, rows of tall chimneys and billowing smoke were drifting in the wind. Amidst the groups of orderly blast furnaces, machines made deafening noises. Suddenly, a burst of raging flames shot out from a blast furnace, and then molten iron flowed like a tame fire dragon along the sand mold. They were tapping iron. To the south of the blast furnace group, there was a series of clanging metal sounds. Walking over, I saw that installers were installing the first small rolling mill. Looking east was the coking plant, known as "Flame Mountain," where a "Red Flag No. 2" simple coking oven had just been put into production.

    Zhuozhou Town is located west of the Taihang Mountains, about 40 to 50 kilometers from the Xiacheting Iron Mine and Xileizi Coal Mine in Zhuoxian County. It is east of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and north of the power grid from Beijing to Zhuozhou. It is a relatively ideal small steel base. In December 1958, the Zhuoxian County Party Committee merged the more than 34,000 small blast furnaces with the county-run Zhuozhou Machinery Factory, Electrical Machinery Factory, and Iron Factory to establish a steel and machinery joint enterprise – the Zhuozhou Steel United Factory.

	The Factory Director's Interests
    In the afternoon, we visited the Deputy Director of Operations of the United Factory in two small new houses. He is a shrewd and capable man, with great interest in continuously reducing costs. He opened his notebook and told the reporter: "Since January, the factory has been implementing economic accounting by workshop, and the cost per ton of iron has been reduced to 300 yuan. With a little more effort, it will be very close to the standard set by the higher authorities."

    Whether the cost of iron could be reduced had caused controversy among the leading cadres of the factory.

    In order to reduce costs, the factory party committee proposed to focus on improving labor productivity and stipulated that mechanical production should be adopted whenever machines could replace manual operations and could be manufactured by themselves. At the same time, it organized all factory cadres to go to the workshops to manage furnaces and work with workers to study and improve operations and formulate raw material consumption quotas. In less than two months, the mechanical and electrical machinery branches of the factory manufactured more than 70 units, including ore crushers, electric and manual winches, electric motors, and inclined automatic loading machines, so that several major production processes such as ore crushing, blast furnace loading, and water supply all used machinery. As a result, labor efficiency increased by seven or eight times. In the past, crushing ore was done by hand hammers, and each person could only crush 400 to 500 jin at most. A small blast furnace with a volume of 6.5 cubic meters required 100 to 200 people to crush ore every day to supply it. But now, four or five people can crush 35 tons of ore a day with one ore crusher, enough for three small blast furnaces. They have installed four ore crushers, and this item alone can save more than 800 people every day.

    Recently, the factory has also proposed a plan for diversified operations. The results of the trial have further reduced the cost of iron to 150 yuan. They use the molten iron from the blast furnace to directly cast products, and have now cast more than ten kinds of products such as vortex engine parts, rails, pliers, and hammers. In the past, the waste slag flowing out of the blast furnace was discarded, but now they have researched using waste slag to calcine ore. According to preliminary tests, the iron content of ore calcined with slag can be increased by 12%, reducing the cost of each ton of ore by 14 yuan. Not long ago, they organized workers to go to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn how to use blast furnace slag to make slag wool, which can be used to manufacture ships, trains, and other fire-resistant materials. In addition to vigorously promoting tar recovery, the coking plant is also studying the use of simple coking oven gas for power generation.

	The Steel Plant's Wings
    Walking north along the north-south main street of Zhuozhou Town, passing through the Drum Tower, you can see several rows of rectangular houses. Some of these houses are built with reed mats and oiled paper, and some are newly built brick houses. This is the mechanical branch of the Steel United Factory. But don't underestimate this place, it is the "heart" of the factory's technological revolution. In these simple houses, the workers of the mechanical factory designed and manufactured a complete set of mechanical equipment for the steel plant. There are tall and flexible automatic loading machines, ore crushers that can replace the labor of 200 people, as well as earthen rails and blowers called the "heart" of the blast furnace... Because of these machines, the small earthen furnace was equipped into a small modern furnace in just two or three months. Therefore, the workers praised it as the "wings of the steel plant."

    We visited the machine shop of this factory. At first, we thought there must be some very precise machines here, but when we walked into the workshop, we saw that the workers were using broken belt lathes. A comrade Zhang who led us to visit said: "Almost all the mechanical equipment of the steel plant is manufactured with these incomplete old lathes."

    In just over a month, they built more than a dozen small blast furnaces with a volume of 6.5 to 28 cubic meters. The cast iron heating pipes alone were three miles long, plus blowers, automatic loading machines, etc. They calculated that if all these mechanical equipment were processed by factories elsewhere, it would take at least five months to deliver them. However, time waits for no one! Under such circumstances, the workers of the mechanical branch put forward the slogan of "using indigenous methods to attack foreign methods, using small methods to attack large methods, and arming ourselves," and as a result, they equipped themselves in less than a month.

    Manufacturing metallurgical machinery and equipment by themselves was indeed full of difficulties for this factory, which used to only produce "small farm tools weighing three to five jin." But all the difficulties were conquered by them. For example, the blower used on the blast furnace, not to mention making it, they had never even seen it, and there were no blueprints. They bought a Roots blower from Tianjin Machinery Factory, disassembled it to use as a model, and cast the parts while "drawing a gourd." Without a large head lathe to process the blades, the workers processed them on a six-foot plane milling machine and made the first Roots blower with an air volume of 25 cubic meters per minute. The test on the blast furnace showed that the effect was very good. To make an inclined automatic loading machine, several hundred kilograms of triangular steel were needed. At that time, it was calculated that more than ten tons of steel would be needed for twenty blast furnaces. Where would there be so much steel? Veteran worker Zuo Shizhen and technician Ban Runmao conducted more than ten experiments, and they finally used rectangular wooden strips instead of triangular steel to make the inclined ladder, and yuan iron rods instead of light steel rails. The loading machine was successful. In this way, after more than two months of hard work, they manufactured seven ore crushers, twenty-five automatic loading machines, and thirteen Roots blowers in one go, equipping the steel plant.

    访涿州钢铁基地
    本报记者　方辰
            面貌全新
    2月初，记者乘北上列车，到了涿州镇。
    在去年大办钢铁的那些日子里，我曾经访问过这座城镇。时隔两个多月，又来到了这里，这里却由烟火弥漫的钢铁小土炉群，发展成为小洋炉群了。
    由涿州车站到旧城，约有一华里，远远望去，一排排高大的烟囱，滚滚的浓烟正随风飘散。在一组组整齐的高炉群中间，机器发出震耳的响声。霎时，高炉中喷射出一股熊熊的火焰，接着铁水像一条驯服的火龙，沿着沙模奔流。那里正在出铁。高炉群的南边，发出一阵阵叮叮当当的金属撞击声，走过去一看，那里，安装工人正在安装第一台小型轧钢机。向东望去，就是被人称作“火焰山”的炼焦厂，一座“红旗二号”简易炼焦炉刚刚投入生产。
    涿州镇，西临太行山，距涿县下车亭铁矿、西垒子煤矿四、五十华里，东靠京广铁路，北面有从北京到涿州的输电网，是个比较理想的小型钢铁基地。1958年12月，中共涿县县委将这里的三万四千多座小高炉和县营涿州机械厂、电机厂、铁工厂合并，建立起钢铁机械联合企业——涿州钢铁联合工厂。
            厂长的兴趣
    下午，我们在两间不大的新房子里，访问了联合厂经营副厂长。他是一个精明强干的人，对于不断降低成本有着极大的兴趣。他翻开记事本对记者说：“从一月份，全厂以车间为单位推行经济核算来看，每吨铁的成本已经降到了三百元。再努一把力，就距上级规定的标准很近了。”
    能不能使铁的成本降下来，在工厂领导干部中间曾引起过争论。
    厂党委为了降低成本，曾提出了从提高劳动生产率方面打主意，并规定：凡是能用机械代替人力操作而自己又能制造的，就采用机械生产；同时，组织全厂干部下车间进行包炉，和工人一起研究改进操作，制定原材料消耗定额。不到两个月时间，这个厂的机械和电机两个分厂职工制造出矿石粉碎机、电动、手摇两用卷扬机、电动机、斜梯式自动上料机等七十多台，使矿石从粉碎到高炉上料、上水等几个主要生产工序都使用上机械，结果劳动效率提高了七、八倍。过去粉碎矿石，都是用人工手锤砸，每人最多只砸四、五百斤，一座容积六点五立方公尺的小高炉，每天得一、二百人砸矿石，才能供得上，可是，现在四、五个人用一台矿石粉碎机，一天就能粉碎三十五吨矿石，足够三座小高炉用的。他们已安装上四台矿石粉碎机，只这一项，每天就可节省八百多人。
    最近，这个厂又提出搞多种经营的方案，试行结果，使铁的成本一降再降到一百五十元。他们用高炉炼出来的铁水直接铸造产品，现在已铸出涡驼机零件、铁轨、钳、锤等十多种产品。过去高炉里流出来的废渣都扔掉了，现在他们研究出用废渣焙烧矿石。据初步试验，经过矿渣焙烧过的矿石，含铁量可提高12％，使每吨矿石的成本降低了十四元。不久前他们组织工人去石景山钢铁厂学习用高炉渣制造渣棉的方法，这种渣棉可以制造轮船、火车等做耐火材料用。炼焦厂除了大力推行焦油回收以外，也在研究用简单炼焦炉煤气发电。
        钢铁厂的翅膀
    顺着涿州镇南北大街往北走，穿过鼓楼，可以望见几排长方形的房屋，这些房屋，有的是用苇席、油纸搭起来的，有的是才盖起的新砖房，这里就是钢铁联合厂的机械分厂。可是，你可不要小看这个地方，它是全厂的技术革命的“心脏”。就在这些简陋的房子里，机械厂工人们为钢铁厂设计制造了一整套机械设备。有高大而又灵巧的自动上料机，有能代替二百多人劳动的矿石粉碎机，还有土铁轨和被人称作高炉“心脏”的鼓风机……，正因为有了这些机械，在短短的两、三个月内，使这座小土炉装备成了小洋炉。因而，工人们称赞它是“钢铁厂的翅膀”。
    我们参观了这个厂的机工车间，起先我们以为，这儿一定有什么很精密的机器，可是，走进车间一看，工人们使用的都是破旧的皮带车床。领着我们参观的一位张同志说：“钢铁厂机械设备，几乎都是用这些残缺不全的旧车床制造出来的。”
    在一个多月的时间内，建设起十几座容积六点五到二十八立方公尺的小高炉，仅铸铁暖风管接起来就有三华里长，加上鼓风机，自动上料机等。他们算了一下，这些机械设备如果全由外地工厂加工，最快也得五个月才能交货。可是，时间不等人呀！在这种情况下，机械分厂职工提出：土攻洋，小攻大，自己武装自己的口号，结果一个月不到，就把自己装配起来了。
    自己制造冶炼机械设备，对这个过去只生产“三、五斤重小农具”的厂子来说，确是困难重重。但是所有困难都被他们征服了。比如高炉上用的鼓风机，别说做，见也没有见过，又没有图纸。他们从天津机械厂买了一台罗式鼓风机拆开来做样板，边按着“葫芦画瓢”，边倒铸件。加工叶片没有大头旋床，工人在六尺平面铣床上加工，做成了第一台每分钟二十五立方公尺风量的罗式鼓风机，在高炉上一试验效果很好。做一台斜梯式自动上料机，需要几百公斤三角钢，当时计算了一下，二十座高炉就得用十几吨钢材，哪里有这么多的钢材。老工人左士珍和技术员班润茂两个人经过了十多次试验，他们终于用长方条木代替三角钢做斜梯，元铁棍代替轻便钢轨，上料机成功了。就这样，他们经过两个多月苦干，一鼓气制造出七台矿石粉碎机，二十五台自动上料机，十三台罗式鼓风机，把钢铁厂装备了起来。（附图片）
