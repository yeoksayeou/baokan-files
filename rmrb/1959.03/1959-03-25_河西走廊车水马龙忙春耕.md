Reported from Zhangye, March 24th: "The Hexi Corridor has beautiful scenery in March, and thousands of people are busy with spring ploughing." These days, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province has fully launched a high tide of spring ploughing and sowing. Every morning, on the main roads leading to the fields in every village, crowds of people driving cattle, horses, mules, camels, and various vehicles are like long dragons. More than 10,000 iron and wooden seeders and a large number of tractors in the entire region have all been put into operation. On the land moistened by the spring snow, there is a hubbub of voices and red flags fluttering everywhere. In this agricultural army of 700,000 people, there is the Nanhu Brigade of the Dunhuang County People's Commune, one of the national spring wheat high-yield counties last year. Their average yield per mu last year was 1,550 jin, and this year they have raised the leaping forward red flag of 3,350 jin. There is Li Chunrong, secretary of the Party branch of the Taizihuan Brigade of the Xuanhua People's Commune in Gaotai County, who achieved a spring wheat yield of 5,400 jin per mu last year. This year, he has set a goal of striving for a yield of 8,000 to 12,000 jin per mu. There are secretaries of Party committees at all levels and a large number of cadres from counties, communes, and brigades, who are fighting side by side with the vast number of commune members in the fields. Now, communes and teams are displaying flags and drums to urge on the warhorses, carrying out a revolutionary great competition to race against time and ensure quality.

This year, the people of Hexi have made full preparations to strive for a greater harvest. The land has been universally deep-plowed. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu has more than doubled last year, reaching about 3,000 jin, with some reaching as high as 150,000 jin per mu, and the highest amount of fertilizer under high-yield land reaching 1.8 million jin. Commune members once organized a large fertilizer collection army in the severe winter, went deep into the Qilian Mountain grasslands, and used methods such as carrying on their backs, transporting by horses, and pulling by cars to bring back a total of 20 billion jin of sheep manure. This year, the amount of seeds sown per mu has also greatly exceeded last year, averaging 30 to 60 jin per mu. After seed selection and mixing, every seed is large and plump, and it is expected that more than 600,000 seedlings can be preserved per mu.

"Sowing one day earlier will ripen ten days earlier." The entire region has generally advanced the spring sowing time, with individual counties starting sowing in late February. Commune members took advantage of the early morning and evening ground frost to carry fertilizer in a concentrated manner, and plowed the ground and sowed seeds when it thawed in the middle and afternoon. In order to strive for rapid sowing and rapid fertilizer transportation, each commune organized skilled craftsmen before spring sowing to create and improve more than 42,000 pieces of sowing, cultivating, harrowing, and transportation tools, which greatly improved labor efficiency. Due to the widespread use of seeders, sowing efficiency has increased more than tenfold. In the entire region, old plows have been eliminated, and motorization has been realized. Many communes have also improved the stoves and mills in the canteens, replacing hand-pulled bellows stoves with natural draft stoves, and changing one donkey pulling one mill to one donkey pulling four or five mills, saving a lot of manpower and animal power for spring ploughing and sowing. In terms of labor organization, each production brigade organized personnel according to agricultural work types and established a field file system at the same time.

This year, the people of Hexi are demanding that the total output value of grain and cotton increase by nearly 100% compared with last year. Achieve a thousand-jin per mu grain production zone and a hundred-jin per mu ginned cotton production zone, so that each person has 3,000 jin of grain and 30 jin of ginned cotton. The Hexi region has a large area, a small population, little rain, and is plagued by wind and sand, which is much worse than the conditions in coastal provinces. However, the people of Hexi are overcoming difficulties with unparalleled heroic spirit and forging ahead courageously. To solve the water source problem, they have been vigorously developing water conservancy since liberation, and since last year, they have launched a "ten thousand reservoirs" movement. This year, with the help of scientific workers, they are preparing to artificially melt snow and ice from the glaciers of the Qilian Mountains in May and June to divert 22.2 million cubic meters of water to irrigate farmland, and to carry out large-scale artificial rainfall in July and August. To prevent and control wind and sand, the people of the entire region will complete the construction of the windbreak forest belt stretching across the northern part of the corridor for a total length of 10,000 li, which began last year, and will plant grass and trees (aerial seeding) on 22.2 million mu of desert and Gobi, striving to fundamentally change the natural appearance of Hexi and build the corridor into a perpetually rich and high-yielding grain and cotton base and a pasture with lush water and grass.

    河西走廊车水马龙忙春耕
    本报张掖24日电　“三月河西风光好，千军万马春耕忙”。这几天，甘肃省的河西走廊已经全面掀起春耕春播高潮。每天清晨，在每个村庄通向田野的大路上，下地的人群赶着牛、马、骡、骆驼和大小车辆，犹如长龙一样。全区一万多部铁制、木制播种机和大批拖拉机已经全部出动。在为春雪所润湿的土地上，到处人声鼎沸，红旗招展。在这一支七十万人的农业大军中，有去年全国春小麦丰产县之一的敦煌县人民公社南湖大队，他们去年平均亩产一千五百五十斤，今年更高的举起了三千三百五十斤的跃进红旗。有去年获得春小麦亩产五千四百斤的高台县宣化人民公社台子寰大队党支部书记李春荣，他今年订下了亩产八千至一万二千斤的奋斗目标。有各级党的书记和县、公社、大队的大批干部，他们和广大的社员一同在地里并肩作战。现在，社社、队队之间展旗擂鼓催战马，进行争时间、保质量的革命大竞赛。
    今年，河西人民为争取更大的丰收进行了充分的准备。土地普遍经过了深耕。平均每亩地的施肥量超过去年一倍以上，达到了三千斤左右，其中高的达到每亩十五万斤，最高的丰产地下肥量达到一百八十万斤。社员们曾经在严冬组织采肥大军，深入祁连山草地，用人背、马驮、汽车拉等办法，共取回二百亿斤羊板粪。今年每亩下种量也大大超过去年，平均每亩三十至六十斤，经过选种、拌种，颗颗籽大粒肥，预计每亩可以保苗六十万株以上。
    “早播一天，早黄十天”，全区普遍提早了春播时间，个别的县在2月下旬就开始播种。社员们利用早晚地冻突击运肥，中、下午解冻就犁地下种。为了争取快速播种，快速运肥，各公社曾在春播前组织能工巧匠创造和改进了播种、耕作、耙耘、运输等工具四万二千多件，使劳动功效大大提高。由于普遍采用播种机，播种功效提高十多倍。在全区，旧犁已经消灭，并实现了车子化。许多公社还改良了食堂的炉灶和磨子，以自然吸风式炉代替手拉风箱炉，改一驴拉一磨为一驴拉四磨、五磨，节省了很多人力畜力，投入春耕、春播。在劳动组织上，各生产大队都按农事工种分套组织人马，同时建立了田间档案制度。
    今年河西人民要求粮棉总产值比去年增长近一倍。实现粮食亩产千斤专区，皮棉亩产百斤专区，做到每人有三千斤粮、三十斤皮棉。河西地区地大、人少、干旱少雨，且有风沙为患，比沿海省份的条件要差得多。但河西人民以无比的英雄气概战胜困难，奋勇前进。他们为解决水源，解放以后即大搞水利，从去年起又展开了万库群（上万个水库）运动，今年又在科学工作者的帮助下，准备5、6月从祁连山的雪海冰川以人工融化冰雪水二千二百万公方引灌农田，在7、8月大搞人工降雨；为防治风沙，全区人民今年将全部完成去年开工的纵横在走廊北部总长达一万华里的防风林带的营建工作，并且要在二千二百万亩的沙漠戈壁上种草植树（飞机撒种），为根本改变河西的大自然面貌，把走廊建设成永远丰裕高产的粮棉基地和水草肥美的牧场而奋斗。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（郑伯亚）
