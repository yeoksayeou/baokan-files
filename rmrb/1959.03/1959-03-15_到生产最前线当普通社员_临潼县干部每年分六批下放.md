To the Production Frontline as Ordinary Commune Members
Lintong County Cadres Sent Down in Six Batches Annually

(Our report) The Lintong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee, in order to make cadre participation in labor a regular system, have decided from this year onwards: "From the County Party Secretary and the County Head to cadres above the commune management area level, with the exception of a few who are elderly or ill and unable to participate in physical labor, will take turns going down to the people's commune production teams as commune members in six batches each year, with each batch lasting at least one month." The first batch of one hundred cadres has already gone down to the production teams to participate in labor, including Comrade Liu Chonghua, the First Secretary of the Lintong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

After the realization of communization throughout the county, when commune cadres still lacked experience in managing large-scale production and managing the lives of the masses, the County Committee immediately transferred a group of cadres to the commune production teams as commune members, to participate in production, serve as cooks, feeders, and nursery workers, and assist commune cadres in their work, which played a significant role in the commune's work at that time, and was well received by the commune members.

In order to further implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on cadres at all levels participating in physical labor, and to ensure an even greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959, the County Committee, while studying the issue of further strengthening leadership over the communes, summarized the experience of the cadres sent down last year and decided to make the rotation of cadres going down as commune members a regular system. The County Committee's decision on the rotation of cadres going down stated: "Comrades who take turns going down as commune members should, based on needs, go to work in more difficult and weak areas." The decision also emphasized: "All comrades who take turns going down as commune members, especially leading cadres, should not only be model laborers, but also strengthen their political and theoretical study and technical study, comprehensively and systematically understand the situation of the people's communes, and help local cadres study and improve their leadership work. Each comrade must also conduct a special study and summary of a more prominent issue in the work, in accordance with the local specific situation and the requirements of higher authorities. At the same time, they should regularly report on their work to the County Committee and the competent departments, in order to enrich their leadership experience and powerfully guide the overall work."

    到生产最前线当普通社员
    临潼县干部每年分六批下放
    本报讯　中共临潼县委、县人委，为了使干部参加劳动成为一项经常制度，决定从今年起：“从县委书记、县长到公社管理区以上干部，除个别人年老和有病不能参加体力劳动外，每年分六批轮流到人民公社生产队当社员，每批时间最少一个月。”第一批一百名干部，已下到生产队参加劳动，其中有中共临潼县委第一书记刘崇华同志。
    在全县实现公社化后，当公社干部还缺乏管理大生产和管理群众生活的经验时，县委立即抽调了一批干部下到公社生产队当社员，参加生产，担任炊事员、饲养员、保育员，协助公社干部工作，对当时公社工作起了很大作用，社员反映很好。
    为了进一步贯彻中共中央、国务院关于各级干部参加体力劳动的指示，和保证1959年工农业生产更大跃进，县委在研究进一步加强对公社的领导问题时，总结了去年下放干部的经验，决定把干部轮流下放当社员做为一项经常性的制度。县委关于干部轮流下放的决定中说：“轮流下放当社员的同志，下去做什么工作，应该根据需要，到比较艰苦和薄弱的工作方面去。”决定还强调指出：“凡轮流下放当社员的同志，特别是领导干部，既要当模范的劳动者，又要加强政治理论学习和技术学习，要全面系统地了解人民公社的情况，帮助当地干部研究和改进领导工作。每一个同志还必须按照当地具体情况和上级要求，就工作中一个比较突出问题进行专题研究总结。同时定期向县委和主管部门作工作汇报，以丰富领导经验，有力地指导全面工作。”
