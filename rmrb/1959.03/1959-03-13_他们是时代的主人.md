They Are Masters of the Era
By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

"Don't look down on our dilapidated factory; we can produce whatever the country needs, and whenever it's needed, we can deliver!" The workers of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant always proudly make this guarantee to the nation.

The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant is "poor but ambitious." With mat-shed workshops and belt-driven machine tools, a glance upon entering reveals rows of brand-new and towering rolling mills and rock loaders gleaming beside the simple workshops and machines.

The workers of this factory have such a spirit: they bristle with displeasure if anyone suggests they can't make a certain machine. This year, the state tasked them primarily with manufacturing rolling mills, and the task is substantial. Not only have these new machines never been made before, but they also lack hundreds of pieces of equipment, posing a great challenge. However, they resolutely accepted the task. From the start of rolling mill manufacturing, the workers launched a "break through the five barriers" (technology, equipment, materials, labor, construction) competition. The carpentry section devised methods of "using substitutes for real materials," "using small for large," and "using inferior for superior," overcoming the barrier of insufficient lumber. The electric furnace team came up with the idea of "using a teapot to cook a camel," loading sixteen tons of material into a three-ton electric furnace, overcoming the barrier of low steel production. Workers and technicians in the forging and riveting workshop successfully tested electroslag welding, overcoming the barrier of not being able to weld large forgings. In a matter of days, the "break through the barriers" campaign spread throughout the factory.

　　　　　　　Three Probes into Deep Mountains

In the past, the foundry workshop used sand transported from Hunan, but the supply was often untimely, sometimes available and sometimes not. Workers devised many methods to manufacture artificial sand as a supplement, but it still couldn't keep up with production needs, and many large parts couldn't be cast. Based on the workshop's suggestion, the leadership entrusted this task to veteran foundry workers Pang Hu and Han Gao. After receiving this task, Pang Hu and Han Gao became obsessed. They thought, "Can't we use Shanxi sand to replace Hunan sand?" The more they thought, the more absorbed they became, immediately deciding to look for sand in their spare time. One Sunday, just as dawn was breaking, Pang Hu shouldered the dry provisions bag sewn by his wife, rode his bicycle, and headed straight for the Honggou Village mountain that people often mentioned. However, on this day, Pang Hu traveled over ninety *li* of mountain roads, climbing all over the hilltops, exhausting himself without finding anything. But he was not discouraged at all. The second Sunday, he and Han Gao went to the mountains west of Taiyuan. After searching for half a day, they still couldn't find any. On their way back, they asked around as they walked, and coincidentally, a farmer said he had seen sand in Qingyou Town. The third Sunday, they arrived in Qingyou Town, walked over fifty *li* along a long river, and discovered a type of white and shiny sand. When they rubbed it in their hands, it was indeed the sand they needed most.

　　　　　　　Installing Teeth for the Gantry Planer

The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant only had one large gantry planer. According to the calculation of the rolling mill parts to be processed at that time, the gantry planer's capacity needed to be increased ninefold. However, the gantry planer had been modified many times in the past. How could it be increased ninefold! All the factory workers were anxious looking at the large piles of parts stacked next to the gantry planer. Li Kesheng, a Communist Party member who had worked on the gantry planer for fifteen years, always felt that the gantry planer was like a vigorous young man with inexhaustible strength. He was determined to unleash the gantry planer's strength this time. As soon as the "break through the barriers" campaign began, he and his team members buried themselves in hard work. They pondered while working during the day and studied next to the gantry planer at night. Li Kesheng thought: the gantry planer is so big, but it only has a "tooth" the size of a little finger, taking a bite every so often, making efficiency low. If we install a few more teeth, wouldn't it bite faster? Therefore, the team members, like dentists, installed four teeth for the gantry planer, greatly improving efficiency. But Li Kesheng was not satisfied and, together with veteran worker Hao Fuyou, improved the gantry planer's processing method, lining up large and small jobs for unified planning. Then they studied how to increase the gantry planer's speed. He didn't leave the gantry planer for more than ten days in a row. Li Kesheng's wife was puzzled because Li Kesheng hadn't been home for many days. Li Kesheng's team finally successfully transformed the gantry planer. They increased the gantry planer's efficiency by more than tenfold. The factory sent good news to the workshop, and people beat gongs and drums to send the good news to Li Kesheng's home. Li Kesheng's wife's doubts of more than ten days were immediately resolved.

　　　　　　　Model of Mutual Assistance and Collaboration

After the factory's competition campaign unfolded, young workers first created a twist drill to replace the core drill, increasing work efficiency eightyfold, earning them a red flag. Li Kesheng's team also won a red flag by completing 10% of the entire month's task in one day. Guo Delong, a veteran worker in the machining workshop, improved his tools, first increasing efficiency thirteenfold, and then increasing it seventeenfold, surpassing Li Kesheng. The winning red flag belongs to this class today and that class tomorrow. In a few days, most workers had planted red flags. However, in several rounds of the competition, Wang Fuye, Wang Shiqing, and Qiao Chenggui's three teams in the steam hammer section, the winning team had always been Wang Fuye's team. They adopted fast joint forging and non-stop hammer methods, first breaking the steam hammer's 500 kg quota, and then creating new records of 800 kg and 1200 kg per shift. Wang Shiqing and Qiao Chenggui's teams couldn't catch up no matter what they did. At first, Wang Fuye's team felt very glorious and excited. But this excitement and glory were quickly replaced by a sense of unease. Wang Fuye felt that although his team had improved production efficiency, the problem of the factory's overall forging capacity being small had not been solved, and many urgently needed forged parts could not be forged. Wang Fuye shared his thoughts with his team members. Everyone felt that planting red flags is glorious, and leading in the competition is also glorious, but the most important thing is to ensure the completion of the entire factory's tasks. Everyone decided to help the other two teams. With assistance, the efficiency of these two teams quickly improved. Wang Shiqing's team even created a new record of forging 1315 kg in one shift with a three-ton steam hammer, surpassing Wang Fuye. The factory presented these three teams with a red flag with the words: "Model of Mutual Assistance and Collaboration." (Attached picture)

    他们是时代的主人
    本报记者　张超
    “别看我们厂子破，国家要什么就能造出什么，什么时候要，我们就能拿出来”！太原矿山机器厂的工人总是这样自豪地向国家提出自己的保证。
    太原矿山机器厂“人穷志大”，席棚厂房、皮带机床，如果你进厂一看，一眼就会看到在简陋的厂房旁和机器旁，一排排崭新而高大的轧钢机、装岩机，闪闪地在发光。
    这个厂的工人有这么一股劲：谁要说他们做不了什么机器，他们就像是受了侮辱似的不乐意。今年国家要他们以制造轧钢机为主，而且任务很大。这些新机器不仅没做过，而且机器设备还差好几百台，困难很大。可是，他们坚决把任务接受下来了。一开始轧钢机制造，工人们就展开了“闯五关”（技术关、设备关、材料关、劳力关、建设关）竞赛。木工工段想出了“以空代实”、“以小代大”、“以次代好”的办法，闯过了木料不足的关。电炉小组想出了“茶壶煮骆驼”的办法，使三吨电炉装了十六吨料，闯过了产钢量少的关。锻铆车间工人和技术员一道试验成功了电渣焊，闯过了大型锻件不能焊接的关。几天工夫“闯关”运动就在全厂展开了。
            三　探　深　山
    过去，熔铸车间用的砂子是从湖南运来的，供应不及时，时有时无，工人们想了很多办法制造人工砂来补充，但仍然赶不上生产需要，而且很多大部件不能铸。领导上根据车间的建议，把这个任务交给了老翻砂工庞湖、韩高等去完成。庞湖和韩高接到这个任务以后，就像着了迷似的。他们想：“用山西砂代替湖南砂不行吗？”他们越想越出神，立即决定在业余时间去找砂子。一个星期日，天刚蒙蒙亮，庞湖背上妻子给缝好的干粮袋，骑上自行车，直奔人们常说的红沟村山去了。可是，这一天，庞湖跑了九十多里的山路，爬遍了山头，弄得精疲力竭，什么也没找见。但他一点也没灰心，第二个星期天，他和韩高一起去太原西边的山上。找了半天，也没有找见。往回走的路上，他们边走边打听，碰巧有一位农民说在青尤镇见过砂子。第三个星期天，他们到了青尤镇，顺着一条长河走了五十多里路，发现有一种白而发亮的砂子，用手一捻，果然是他们最需要的砂子。
          给龙门刨装牙
    太原矿山机器厂只有一台大型龙门刨床，按照当时要加工的轧钢机部件计算，龙门刨的能力要提高九倍才行。但是龙门刨过去已改装过好多次，怎能提高九倍！全厂工人眼看着堆在龙门刨床旁边的大堆部件着急。在龙门刨上工作了十五年的共产党员李克盛，他老觉得龙门刨像一个血气方刚的青年小伙子，有使不尽的力气。他决心在这次让龙门刨把力气使出来。“闯关”运动一开始，他就和小组的人埋头苦钻。他们白天边干活边琢磨，晚上就到龙门刨旁边研究。李克盛想：龙门刨个子那么大，可是只有一个小拇指头大的
  “牙齿”，半天啃一下，效率很低，如果多装几颗牙，不就啃得快了吗？于是，小组的人就像牙科医生似的，给龙门刨装了四颗牙，效率提高很多。但李克盛还不满足，又和老工人郝富有改进了龙门刨的加工方法，把大活、小活进行排队，统筹安排。接着又研究加快龙门刨的转速。他一连十多天没离开龙门刨。李克盛的妻子见李克盛好多天不回家，很纳闷。李克盛小组终于把龙门刨改造成功了。他们把龙门刨效率提高了十多倍。厂里给车间送了喜报，人们又敲锣打鼓的把喜报送到李克盛家里。李克盛的妻子十多天的疑团一下解开了。
          互助协作模范
    厂里的竞赛运动展开以后，青年工人首先创造了麻花钻代替花钻，工作效率提高八十倍，得到了红旗。李克盛小组又以一天完成了全月10％的任务夺得了红旗。加工车间老工人郭德隆改进了工具，第一次提高效率十三倍，第二次又提高了十七倍，超过了李克盛。优胜红旗今天是这个班的，明天就是那个班的，不几天，大部分工人都插上了红旗。但是汽锤工段的王富业、王时清、乔成贵三个小组在竞赛的几个回合中，获胜的一直是王富业小组。他们采用了快速联合锻造、歇人不歇锤的办法，首先打破了汽锤五百公斤定额，接着又创造了台时八百公斤、一千二百公斤的新纪录。王时清、乔成贵小组怎么也赶不上。开始王富业小组觉得很光荣，很兴奋。但这种兴奋和光荣感很快被一种不安的心情代替了。王富业觉得虽然自己的小组提高了生产效率，但整个厂的锻压能力小的问题并没有解决，很多急需锻造的部件锻不出来。王富业和小组的人谈了自己的想法。大家都觉得：插红旗是光荣，在竞赛中领先也光荣，但最重要的还是保证全厂任务完成。大家决定去帮助那两个小组。这两个小组经过帮助，效率很快地提高了。王时清小组竟创造了三吨汽锤一班锻造一千三百一十五公斤的新纪录，超过了王富业。厂里给这三个小组赠送了一面红旗，上面写着：“互助协作模范”。（附图片）
