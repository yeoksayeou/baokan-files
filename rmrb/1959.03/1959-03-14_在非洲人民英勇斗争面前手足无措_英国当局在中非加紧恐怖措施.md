Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Lusaka report: The British Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Benson, announced on the morning of the 12th that the Zambia African National Congress in Northern Rhodesia was banned, and all leaders of this nationalist organization were arrested.

With the development of the Nyasaland African People's national independence movement and the approaching date of the Northern Rhodesia "elections," the British colonial authorities became increasingly uneasy about the activities of the Zambia African National Congress and had long planned to suppress it. On March 4th, ten members of this organization had already been arrested. According to Western news agencies, one of the important topics on the agenda of the secret meeting of the heads of the British colonial authorities in Central Africa held on the 8th was to plot a unified conspiracy to suppress the African National Congress organizations.

Prior to this, within the so-called Central African Federation, the colonial authorities had successively banned the two African National Congress organizations in Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland on February 26th and March 3rd. Following this, they launched a large-scale bloody suppression of the Nyasaland Africans' struggle for freedom and independence. Currently, only the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress, which the British colonial authorities consider to be "much more moderate," has not been banned in this "federation."

Northern Rhodesia is famous for its rich mineral deposits. It is a major producer of copper, with its output in 1956 accounting for about 13% of the total output of the capitalist world, ranking third in the world. It also produces cobalt and uranium, and is one of Britain's sources of atomic raw materials. This region has approximately 2.2 million Africans and over 70,000 Europeans. One of the purposes of the British colonialists in organizing the so-called Central African Federation is to more ruthlessly exploit the cheap labor of Nyasaland Africans to develop the mineral deposits here.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Blantyre report: The British colonial authorities in Nyasaland admitted that since the declaration of a "state of emergency" in Nyasaland nine days ago, 400 members of the African National Congress have been arrested. The colonial authorities also admitted that as of the 11th, 41 Africans had been killed and 64 injured.

However, the heroic struggle of the people of Nyasaland for freedom and independence has continued to grow. In the Northern Province of Nyasaland, African workers in the public works department are continuing their strike; African residents are also refusing to move roadblocks for the colonial authorities. These actions have hit the suppression activities of the British colonial military and police, who rely on supplies airlifted in, because many roads in this province have been destroyed.

Reports say that colonial troops from Southern Rhodesia appear to be preparing to be stationed in Nyasaland for a long time, and the colonial authorities have published a newspaper for the stationed troops.

There are also reports that the British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, who is "visiting" East Africa, is scheduled to fly to Nyasaland on the afternoon of the 12th.

### 在非洲人民英勇斗争面前手足无措  英国当局在中非加紧恐怖措施

    在非洲人民英勇斗争面前手足无措
    英国当局在中非加紧恐怖措施
    新华社12日讯　北罗得西亚首府卢萨喀消息：北罗得西亚的英国总督本逊在12日晨宣布取缔北罗得西亚赞比亚非洲人国民大会，并且逮捕了这个民族主义组织的所有领袖。
    随着尼亚萨兰非洲人民族独立运动的开展和北罗得西亚“选举”日期的临近，英国殖民当局对赞比亚非洲人国民大会的活动日益感到不安，早就预谋加以镇压。在3月4日，就曾经逮捕了这个组织的十名成员。据西方通讯社透露，在8日举行的中非英国殖民当局首脑秘密会议上，重要议题之一就是策划统一镇压非洲人国民大会组织的阴谋。
    在此以前，在所谓中非联邦境内，殖民当局已在2月26日和3月3日先后取缔了南罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰的两个非洲人国民大会组织。接着，他们就对尼亚萨兰非洲人争取自由、独立的斗争展开了大规模的血腥镇压。目前，在这个“联邦”境内就只剩下英殖民当局认为“温和得多的”北罗得西亚非洲人国民大会还没有被取缔。
    北罗得西亚以具有丰富的矿藏著名。它盛产铜，1956年的产量约占资本主义世界总产量的13％，居世界第三位。它还产钴和铀，是英国原子原料来源地之一。这个地区约有二百二十万非洲人，欧洲人七万余名。英国殖民者组织所谓中非联邦的目的之一，就是要更残酷地剥削尼亚萨兰非洲人的廉价劳动力，来开发这里的矿藏。
    新华社12日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰英国殖民当局承认，自尼亚萨兰宣布“紧急状态”九天以来，已经逮捕了四百名非洲人国民大会会员。殖民当局还承认，截至11日为止，已有四十一名非洲人被打死，六十四人受伤。
    但是，英勇的尼亚萨兰人民为争取自由、独立而展开的斗争有增无已。在尼亚萨兰北方省，公共工程部门的非洲工人在继续罢工；非洲居民也拒绝给殖民当局搬动路障。这些行动打击了依仗空投物资接济的英国殖民军警的镇压活动，因为在这个省里许多公路都被破坏了。
    有消息说，从南罗得西亚开来的殖民军队看来准备在尼亚萨兰长期驻下来，殖民当局已为驻军出版了一种报纸。
    还有消息说，正在东非“访问”的英国负责殖民事务国务大臣佩思预定在12日下午飞到尼亚萨兰。
