Xinhua News Agency, 28th—The production competition held in 1958 by state-owned and jointly-owned (public-private) farms in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin has concluded on the 25th under the auspices of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. During the competition, the milk production of the farms in these three cities greatly increased in 1958, and the reproduction of dairy cows also accelerated. The yields of other products such as vegetables also saw significant increases. The farms in Beijing were rated first due to their better overall performance and were awarded the winning red flag by the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation.

At the evaluation meeting, the farms in the three cities, aiming to accelerate the development of vegetables, dairy, meat, eggs, and other subsidiary foods to supply the cities, began the 1959 competition.

Participating in the 1958 production competition evaluation were the Shuangqiao, Nanjiao, and Xijiao State Farms in Beijing, the Dongjiao and Beijiao State Livestock Farms, twelve state-owned and jointly-owned livestock farms in Shanghai, and the Yangliuqing and Shuanglin State Farms in Tianjin. Beijing, which won the competition, increased the average milk yield per dairy cow by 1,400 catties compared to 1957, completing the competition targets best; it also cultivated batches of high-yield dairy cows that produced over 20,000 catties and over 16,000 catties of milk per year, respectively. Among them, the "Beijing No. 1" dairy cow produced 28,382 catties of milk in 300 days last year. The survival rate of dairy cow reproduction in Beijing's farms reached 84.9%, slightly lower than Tianjin's 85.5%. Milk production in Shanghai and Tianjin also greatly exceeded that of 1957. The average milk yield per dairy cow in Shanghai increased by 766.5 catties compared to 1957. Both cities cultivated batches of high-yield dairy cows that produced over 16,000 catties of milk per year. Most farms made significant achievements in reducing milk costs and improving quality. In terms of vegetable production, the average net yield of Chinese cabbage planted by the Xijiao Farm in Beijing reached 12,303 catties per mu on a large area, with an average yield of 54,300 catties per mu on 1.2 mu. The Nanjiao Farm was second, with 11,000 catties per mu. The Yangliuqing Farm in Tianjin had the highest yields of kale and tomatoes, with an average yield of over 10,000 catties per mu on a large area. The Dongjiao Farm in Beijing and the Shuanglin and Yangliuqing Farms in Tianjin also achieved high yields of rice on large areas. Among them, the rice yield of Shuanglin Farm exceeded 1,000 catties per mu on more than 4,600 mu.

In addition to Beijing's victory, the Shuangqiao Farm and the Dongjiao and Beijiao Livestock Farms in Beijing, the Sixth State-owned Livestock Farm and the Sanxing and Liyuan Jointly-owned Livestock Farms in Shanghai, and the Yangliuqing and Shuanglin Farms in Tianjin also received award flags from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. Some had significant achievements in production leaps, while others had more significant achievements in production management or technological innovation.

The new competition content of the farms in the three cities is richer than in 1958. Not only will they compete in milk production, dairy cow breeding, and vegetable production, but they will also add competitions in pork, chicken, and duck production, and other subsidiary foods. The farms in the three cities must raise a large number of fat pigs weighing over 200 catties in eight months, and some of them should strive to raise them in six months. Each farm in Beijing guarantees to raise 10,000 chickens weighing 1.5 to 2 catties each in 80 days, and ducks weighing 3.5 to 4.5 catties each in 60 days, and also guarantees to cultivate a large number of high egg-laying chickens.

    用更多菜、肉、蛋、乳供应城市
    北京、上海、天津各农牧场开展副食品生产竞赛
    新华社28日讯　北京、上海、天津三市的国营和公私合营农牧场1958年举行的生产竞赛，在农垦部主持下已经在25日评比结束。竞赛中，这三个市的农牧场1958年的牛乳生产都大大增产，乳牛繁殖也加快了。其他如蔬菜等产量也有显著提高。北京市各场因总的成绩较好被评为第一，获得了农垦部奖给的优胜红旗。
    评比会上，三个市的农牧场又以加速发展蔬菜、乳类、肉类、蛋等副食品供应城市为目标，开始了1959年的竞赛。
    参加1958年生产竞赛评比的，有北京市的双桥、南郊、西郊三个国营农场和东郊、北郊两个国营畜牧场，上海市的国营和公私合营的十二个牧场，天津市的杨柳青、双林两个国营农场。获得优胜的北京市，每头乳牛的平均产乳量比1957年提高了一千四百斤，完成竞赛指标最好；而且培育了每头年产乳两万斤以上和一万六千斤以上的高产乳牛各一批，其中“北京一号”乳牛去年三百天就产乳二万八千三百八十二斤。北京市各场的乳牛繁殖成活率达84.9％，略低于天津的85.5％。上海和天津的牛乳生产也大大超过了1957年。上海每头乳牛的平均产乳量比1957年增长了七百六十六点五斤。两市都培育了一批每头年产乳在一万六千斤以上的高产乳牛。在降低牛乳成本和提高质量方面，大部分农牧场都有显著成绩。在蔬菜生产方面，北京市西郊农场所种的大白菜，大面积平均每亩净菜产量高达一万二千三百零三斤，其中有一点二亩平均亩产达五万四千三百斤。其次为南郊农场，高达一万一千斤。甘兰、蕃茄的产量以天津市杨柳青农场为高，大面积平均每亩产量都超过了一万斤。北京东郊、天津双林、杨柳青等场的水稻也获得了大面积的高产。其中双林农场的水稻，有四千六百多亩每亩产量在一千斤以上。
    除北京市优胜外，北京市的双桥农场和东郊、北郊两畜牧场，上海市的国营第六牧场、公私合营三星和丽园两牧场，天津杨柳青、双林两农场也获得了农垦部的奖旗。它们有的生产跃进成绩大，有的在生产管理或技术革新方面有较显著的成就。
    三个市农牧场的新竞赛内容比1958年更加充实。不仅在牛乳生产、乳牛繁殖和蔬菜生产等方面竞赛，又增加了养猪、养鸡、养鸭等副食品的竞赛。三市各场都要在八个月育成二百斤以上的大量肥猪，而且其中一部分要争取在六个月内育成。北京每场保证八十天各养出一万只体重一点五到二斤的鸡，和六十天体重达三点五到四点五斤的鸭，还保证要培育出大量的产卵很高的鸡。（附图片）
