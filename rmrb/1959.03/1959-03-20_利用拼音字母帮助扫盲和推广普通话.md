Using Pinyin Alphabet to Aid Literacy and Promote Putonghua
Wu Yuzhang

Since May of last year, I have traveled to several places, taking a brief look and learning many new things, which has been very encouraging. I have been to nine provinces and cities: Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. In each place, I consulted with local officials in charge of cultural and educational departments to understand the situation of literacy work and the promotion of Putonghua (Standard Mandarin). Within the limits of my physical strength, I also visited some schools, factories, streets, and people's communes.

In January and February of this year, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, together with the Ministry of Education, formed a working group and went to Guangzhou, Xinhui, Foshan, Zhongshan, Shantou, Huiyang, Puning, Jieyang, Chao'an in Guangdong Province, and Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Datian, Fuzhou in Fujian Province to understand the local promotion of Putonghua and the implementation of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme.

According to what we have seen in various places, the literacy work in the past year has been very successful. Many people, through hard work, have shaken off illiteracy and begun to master writing. This is a very gratifying thing. However, there are different degrees of "relapse" in various places. In some areas, the "relapse" phenomenon is quite serious. Because literacy campaigns have adopted a blitz approach, coupled with heavy production tasks, there has been no timely consolidation, and naturally there is "relapse." Responsible comrades in various provinces and cities believe that in 1959, it is necessary to continue to carry out literacy work effectively and strive to do a good job in consolidating and expanding the results of literacy.

How to improve the quality of literacy, to "re-familiarize" those who have "relapsed," to consolidate the literacy of those who have become literate, and to further improve it, I think is a major issue in current educational work.

In his report "The Current Tasks of Writing Reform" at the CPPCC National Committee meeting on January 10th last year, Premier Zhou raised the issue of using the Pinyin alphabet to improve the efficiency of Chinese character teaching. He said: "I think it should be admitted that Chinese characters are difficult to read and write, and therefore difficult to remember. Not to mention children who are just learning Chinese characters, even adults who have studied for many years still do not recognize many Chinese characters or read them incorrectly. Now, on the one hand, we are simplifying the strokes of Chinese characters, and on the other hand, we are annotating them with Pinyin, with the aim of reducing the difficulty of reading and writing Chinese characters so that they can be easily grasped by the masses. The use of Pinyin can improve the efficiency of Chinese character teaching, which has been proven by the rapid literacy methods of the past and the current experience of teaching phonetic alphabet first in primary schools. It is to be hoped that after the Pinyin scheme is approved by the National People's Congress, it can be used to annotate Chinese characters in primary school textbooks and literacy textbooks in the Northern dialect area. Primary school literacy education and illiteracy elimination work will be greatly facilitated, which can be asserted."

Using Pinyin Alphabet for Literacy Can Improve Effectiveness and Consolidate Achievements

According to what we have seen in various places, the use of Pinyin alphabet to help children recognize characters and correct pronunciation has generally been effective. As for the method of using Pinyin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters to help literacy (for the sake of convenience, this method of literacy can be called "Pinyin literacy"), pilot projects have been carried out in Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces and have been successful.

The Pinyin scheme uses the Latin alphabet. This alphabet is unfamiliar to the workers and peasants in our country. Can it be accepted by the masses? Our people do not have the habit of Pinyin. Is it difficult for workers and peasants to master this set of alphabets and Pinyin methods? Can the application of Pinyin alphabet in literacy work be effective? In the past, people's views on these questions were not necessarily consistent. The pilot projects in these three provinces answered the above three questions.

First, the Pinyin alphabet is very popular among the masses. The masses in Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu generally believe that the Pinyin alphabet is a "magic weapon for literacy" and a "teacher who does not speak"; after mastering the alphabet, literacy can be "self-taught without a teacher." The masses in Shandong Province said: "The teacher is really good, following me all the time. If I don't recognize a word, I quickly find it." However, at the beginning, the masses were skeptical about the Pinyin alphabet, thinking it was foreign language and useless to learn. They were also not accustomed to practicing pronunciation. In the pilot class of Shibuzhai, Qixia Mountain, Nanjing City, everyone laughed desperately on the first day of class when teaching the first letter a. Especially the women, they were unwilling to open their mouths to pronounce. Some people even made strange remarks, saying it sounded like a frog croaking. Cao Luofen, the organization committee member of Beixiashu branch in Wanxian District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, is fifty-four years old this year. His family has been a farmhand for two generations. After Cao Luofen learned the Pinyin alphabet last autumn, he did not have time to further rely on the alphabet to learn Chinese characters due to the tight production schedule. Although he does not know Chinese characters now, he can write with Pinyin alphabet. He wrote a poem with Pinyin alphabet, from which we can see the feelings of the general workers and peasants towards the Pinyin alphabet: My name is Cao Luofen, I have been a farmhand for eighteen springs. The exploitation system is really unbearable, the class enemy is a wolf's heart. The Communist Party came and we turned over, the poor people became happy people. Agricultural leap forward and another leap forward, grain and cotton piled up and broke through the clouds. The cultural revolution is rising, the Chinese Pinyin is in my heart. The old man also wants to learn culture, to be loyal to the motherland and repay the Party's grace.

Second, the masses have no difficulty in learning the Pinyin alphabet. According to the experience of Shandong Province, a illiterate or semi-literate person can generally learn it in ten to twelve hours. According to the experience of Hebei Province, general students can basically master it after seven to twelve lessons (one to one and a half hours each time). In the two pilot classes in Jiangsu Province: one took twelve nights, and the other took nine nights (about one hour each night), to teach the Pinyin alphabet. The masses generally have three difficulties in learning the Pinyin alphabet: (1) some compound vowels, especially nasal vowels, are composed of three or four letters, which are considered long; (2) the usage of two semi-vowels is a little complicated; (3) there are three vowels that have to omit a letter in the middle when combined with consonants. The above three points only require being able to read them correctly, not to write them completely accurately, so the difficulty is not great. As for the shape of the Pinyin letters, although it is unfamiliar to the masses, there are only twenty-six in total, and only lowercase letters are taught, neither uppercase nor cursive, so it is not difficult. There is also no difficulty in teaching the pronunciation of the letters in the Northern dialect area. Now it is used as a tool for literacy. Some sounds may not be accurate at one time, but it is not necessary to require complete accuracy, which does not hinder literacy.

Third, the Pinyin alphabet can improve the efficiency of language teaching and consolidate and expand the results of literacy. After the masses learn the Pinyin alphabet, they can not only consolidate the Chinese characters they have already learned, but also increase their knowledge of more Chinese characters and continuously improve. For example, the eleven barbers in the barber shop of Xin'an Town, Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, graduated from literacy in April last year. After learning the Pinyin alphabet in October, they read phonetic readings every day; they annotated Pinyin on big-character posters, poems, and reports. Recently, through one-by-one word-by-word inspection, all eleven members of the group have increased their knowledge by an average of 653 characters on the basis of the original 2,000 characters. Zhai Xinghua, who has improved the most, has increased his knowledge by 1,500 characters; Li Xueqin, who has improved the least, has increased his knowledge by 350 characters. They can now read "Xinhua Daily", read popular readings, write letters, and take notes. Zhai Xinghua published an article he wrote in the "Xinhua Daily" on January 14th this year, entitled "Learning Chinese Pinyin Alphabet Helps Me Increase My Knowledge by More Than a Thousand Characters". He wrote: "Learning the Pinyin alphabet is very useful. It will teach you the words you don't know, and it can replace the words you can't write; once I read 'Liu Jiemei Forgets His Roots and Turns Back', I came across the word 'ragged', and many people didn't know it. Later, I checked the dictionary and found out that it was spelled lanlou, and I knew it meant ragged clothes. In the past, when I listened to reports, I was worried that I couldn't remember them. After learning the Pinyin alphabet, I became bolder. I wrote the Chinese characters with pinyin alphabet. After listening to the report, I checked the dictionary to fill in the Chinese characters. After many days, not only did I consolidate the Chinese characters I originally knew, but I also learned many new words." According to the experience of Hebei Province, after one month of study, the students who graduated from literacy, in addition to learning the Pinyin alphabet and consolidating the words they have already learned, can increase their knowledge by an average of more than 500 Chinese characters.

Another feature of Pinyin literacy is that it is convenient for the masses to study by themselves. After September last year, due to the tight production schedule, the mass spare-time study in most areas was suspended. However, there are still some students who, using the gaps in production, rely on the Pinyin alphabet to persist in self-study, not only consolidating the existing achievements, but also further improving. For example, Niu Aixiang and Zhang Xiuzhen, graduates of literacy in Daxingwang Village, Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, relied on the Pinyin alphabet to consolidate 1,500 characters. They also used the gaps in production to study hard and finished reading the first volume of the phonetic amateur primary school textbook. Because of their good academic performance, Niu Aixiang is now a part-time primary school teacher for the main course, and Zhang Xiuzhen is a tutor in the part-time primary school class.

The Pinyin literacy work in Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces, despite the interruption for several months due to the tight production schedule, its effectiveness has already been seen. The Pinyin alphabet is indeed helpful for literacy: the quality is better, and it is particularly conducive to consolidation and improvement.

Is there any harm in Pinyin literacy? I think there is no harm. Some people have a concern about Pinyin literacy, that is, they feel that they have to learn the alphabet and Chinese characters, which will increase the burden on the masses and lengthen the literacy time. Last year, everyone competed for speed in literacy, the faster the better, so they always felt that teaching the Pinyin alphabet would delay things. Now it seems that this concern is unfounded. According to the experience of Shandong, Hebei and other provinces, it only takes one or two months for an illiterate person to graduate from learning the alphabet to literacy. Speed is important, but it must be based on ensuring quality, which is in line with the principle of more, faster, better and more economical results. I think this can be regarded as our experience in literacy work last year. Besides, in addition to being a literacy tool, the Pinyin alphabet has many uses, such as looking up dictionaries, learning Putonghua, algebra, geometry, physics, and chemistry all cannot do without the Pinyin alphabet, namely the Latin alphabet. This set of alphabets is essential for everyone in modern countries who has received secondary education. Therefore, combining literacy with teaching the Pinyin alphabet should never be seen as adding an extra burden.

Is there any difficulty in promoting Pinyin literacy? It should be said that there are difficulties. This is a new work, and it cannot be said that there are no difficulties at all. But these difficulties are easy to overcome. How can we do this work well? According to the experience of Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong, it can be summarized into these five points: First, Party committee leadership and secretaries taking the lead. This is the key to doing all work well, and the same is true for Pinyin literacy work. In Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, all places where the Party committee attaches importance and strengthens leadership have achieved relatively significant results. Second, in-depth publicity and mobilizing the masses. Because this is a new work, we must do a good job of in-depth publicity to the masses, explain the effectiveness of the Pinyin alphabet and the purpose of learning clearly, eliminate various misunderstandings and doubts, and launch mass movements to create momentum. Third, integrating with production and unified planning. In terms of teaching form and time arrangement, we must closely integrate with production, political movements, and central work, and make unified arrangements to implement the policy of serving production and politics. Fourth, cultivating backbone and training teachers. We must select a group of literacy cadres, train them, and then let them go back to train civilian teachers. Most of the teachers in primary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities have learned the Pinyin alphabet, and their strength can also be used to train and guide civilian teachers. Fifth, compiling and printing teaching materials and supplying reading materials. We must compile and print Pinyin alphabet readers, phonetic literacy textbooks, and part-time primary school textbooks, and supply phonetic readings with Chinese characters and Pinyin alphabet.

At present, a total of three million workers and peasants in Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu provinces have learned and are learning the Pinyin alphabet. Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and other provinces are also vigorously carrying out Pinyin literacy work. A township in the suburbs of Beijing is also conducting pilot projects. We believe that, except for minority language areas, parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, parts of Guangxi, and other Chinese dialect areas, all other provinces in the country belong to the Northern dialect area, the so-called "Mandarin area", which is not very different from Putonghua in terms of pronunciation, and this method can be fully applicable. Although the pronunciation of Fujian is far from Putonghua, due to certain favorable conditions, most of their literacy is carried out in Putonghua, and it seems that this method can also be applicable. Whether other dialect areas are suitable for literacy can be piloted first, and if it proves effective, it can be gradually promoted. As for the masses who have already become literate in the dialect areas, I think we can teach them the Pinyin alphabet, so that on the one hand, it will help them continue to improve, and on the other hand, it will be convenient for them to learn Putonghua.

The promotion of Putonghua has gradually become a social trend in some areas

In the past year, many areas across the country, such as Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and She County in Anhui, Zouping and Fan County in Shandong, Hejian and Baoding in Hebei, Ye County and Dengfeng in Henan, Kaiyuan and Zhuanghe in Liaoning, Baiquan and Tonghe in Heilongjiang, Siping in Jilin, Linyi in Shanxi, and other cities and counties, have done a lot of work and achieved great results in promoting Putonghua. Fujian and Guangdong are the regions with the most complex dialects in our country. In the past, when cadres from other provinces came to work there, they had to have people who understood the local language as translators. At various meetings, a lot of time was wasted due to language barriers. Often, reports were made in the morning, and then translated into various dialects in the afternoon. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the situation has changed greatly. First of all, except for remote areas, primary and secondary schools have generally begun to teach in Putonghua. More importantly, Putonghua has gone out of the school gate and begun to be promoted to the society, and the countryside is more active than the city, with great enthusiasm. Especially in Fujian, learning Putonghua and speaking Putonghua has gradually become a social trend. In many people's communes, Putonghua is quite common. In Jiangsu Province, Kunshan, Xinyi, Jintan, Fengxian, Jiangpu, Liyang, Wujin, Jiangyin, and other counties have promoted the Pinyin alphabet and promoted Putonghua among most of the young and middle-aged people in a mass movement way, and have achieved great success.

Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the situation has developed rapidly, and the Party's policies and tasks at each stage need to meet the masses quickly, so that when the Party committee calls, the masses will rise up in response. Under this circumstance, the need to promote Putonghua is even more urgent. Since the second half of 1958, many counties and cities in Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu and other provinces have combined the Great Leap Forward in production and adopted the method of launching mass movements to vigorously promote Putonghua. Now, a large part of the young and middle-aged people in these areas have begun to be able to speak and listen to Putonghua. This is a new situation that emerged in the promotion of Putonghua in 1958. The masses in Fujian Province believe that Putonghua has ten benefits: (1) It is good to strengthen the unity of cadres (referring to local cadres and foreign cadres); (2) It is good to strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses (referring to foreign cadres and local masses); (3) It is good to improve political awareness (referring to being able to understand reports and broadcasts); (4) It is good to facilitate the exchange of experience; (5) It is good to shift the social atmosphere; (6) It is good to facilitate cultural learning; (7) It is good to facilitate daily life; (8) It is good to strengthen the unity of the people; (9) It is good to adapt to the leap forward situation; (10) It is good to promote writing reform. Therefore, the promotion of Putonghua has become a common requirement of leaders and the masses in these areas.

The promotion of Putonghua should also be combined with production and follow the mass line

The reason why the promotion of Putonghua work achieved such great results last year, in addition to the support of Party committees at all levels and the demands of the masses, is also due to the mass line and close integration with production. For example, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, lacked teaching materials for promoting Putonghua. After mobilizing the masses, the masses compiled and printed 88,876 textbooks, 84,720 Pinyin alphabet charts, and 239,340 Putonghua and Kunshan dialect comparison tables, and also created more than 40 kinds of teaching aids. Jieyang County, Guangdong, compiled and printed 200,000 copies of Chinese Pinyin textbooks, and the conversational textbooks compiled by the commune were printed and distributed in more than 264,000 copies. In terms of combining with production, various places have created many experiences. Facts have proved that learning Putonghua can be completely combined with production. On the water conservancy construction site of Qipan Daying, Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, the masses sang ditties and shouted slogans in Putonghua when carrying soil, digging soil, and ramming, and the masses were very interested. On the Grand Canal construction site in Feng County, Jiangsu Province, the Pinyin alphabet song was used to replace the slogan, and the teacher shouted and encouraged slogans in Putonghua. In Zouping County, Shandong Province, the work of promoting Putonghua was combined with poetry competitions, and peasant poets used Putonghua to recite their own poems. In many areas, the promotion of Putonghua is also combined with the masses' cultural learning, and the Pinyin alphabet is used to help improve the masses' cultural level, which has achieved significant results.

From the situation in Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangsu, it seems that in dialect areas, adopting the method of secretaries taking the lead and launching mass movements to vigorously promote Putonghua can achieve great results. But on the other hand, the use of dialects is a long-term habit of the people, and popularizing Putonghua is a long-term and arduous task. Therefore, mass movements must be combined with regular work, and we must pay attention to teaching the Pinyin alphabet well to consolidate and improve the quality of Putonghua. Now, some areas stipulate that the time for popularizing Putonghua is too short and too urgent, and I think it can be appropriately lengthened. Relying solely on a sudden movement to achieve "Putonghuaization" among the young and middle-aged people is an unrealistic idea. We must establish regular work, and we must take consolidation measures. We would rather slow down the pace a bit and put this work on a truly reliable basis. In dialect areas, the promotion of Putonghua should have different requirements for different objects, and the requirements must be lowered at the beginning. Among workers and peasants, we only seek to be able to basically listen to and speak Putonghua, first popularizing it, and then gradually improving it. The promotion of Putonghua should take a variety of forms, mainly based on needs and voluntary participation. It should be vigorously promoted and encouraged with various methods such as observation, evaluation, competition, etc., and should not be adopted in a compulsory manner. It should be pointed out that the promotion of Putonghua does not mean abolishing dialects. People in this area should be allowed to continue to use dialects while promoting Putonghua. As for the work of teaching Pinyin alphabet and Putonghua in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools in various places, we must pay attention to continuing to consolidate and improve it, so that students can master the Pinyin alphabet proficiently and use pure Putonghua. Schools are still an important position for promoting Putonghua, and we must not relax.

Based on the above situation, we have this experience: the use of Chinese Pinyin alphabet to help consolidate literacy results and promote Putonghua has begun to achieve results and is welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants. It is hoped that all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will vigorously publicize and promote the Pinyin alphabet according to their own situations and needs. In the Northern dialect area, the so-called "Mandarin area", it can be mainly used to consolidate and expand literacy results, and in the dialect area, it can be mainly used as a tool for promoting Putonghua. Comrade Shaoqi proposed in the work report of the Eighth National Congress Second Session that "actively carrying out the reform of Chinese characters" as one of the main tasks of the current cultural revolution. We want to build our country in fifteen, twenty, or more years into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We must strive to realize the cultural revolution in a relatively short period of time, improve the cultural level of the broad masses of people, and realize the standardization of Chinese – basically popularizing Putonghua among the Han people. Therefore, vigorously promoting the Pinyin alphabet among the broad masses of people to help them learn culture and unify language is an important part of our country's socialist construction.

    利用拼音字母帮助扫盲和推广普通话
    吴玉章
    去年5月以来，我跑了好几个地方，走马看花，看到许多新鲜事物，学到许多东西，受到很大鼓舞，我到过辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河北、山东、河南、湖北、江苏、上海九个省市。每到一个地方，我都找当地文教部门负责同志了解扫盲工作和推广普通话工作的情况，在体力允许的范围之内，还参观了一些学校、工厂、街道和人民公社。
    今年1、2月，中国文字改革委员会会同教育部组成了一个工作组，到了广东省的广州、新会、佛山、中山、汕头、惠阳、普宁、揭阳、潮安和福建省的漳州、厦门、泉州、大田、福州，了解了当地推广普通话和推行汉语拼音方案的情况。
    根据我们在各地看到的，过去一年来的扫盲工作，成绩是很大的。很多群众经过刻苦努力，脱离了文盲状态，开始掌握文字。这是一件十分可喜的事。但是各地都有不同程度的“回生”现象，有些地区，“回生”现象相当严重，因为扫盲采取的是突击方式，加上生产任务繁重，没有及时加以巩固，自然就“回生”了。各省市负责同志都认为1959年必须继续切实扫盲，并且要努力做好巩固和扩大扫盲成果的工作。
    怎样使扫盲的质量提高，“回生”的使它
  “回熟”，脱盲的使它巩固，并且进一步提高，我看是当前教育工作中一个大问题。
    去年1月10日周总理在政协全国委员会举行的报告会上所作“当前文字改革的任务”这个报告中，曾经提出利用拼音字母来提高汉字的教学效率问题。他说：“我看应该承认：汉字是难读难写的，因而也就难记。不要说初学汉字的儿童，就是学了多年的成人，对于不少的汉字也还是不认识，或者要读错。现在我们一方面简化汉字的笔画，另一方面给它注上拼音，目的在于减少汉字的读和写的困难，让它容易为广大群众掌握。利用拼音可以提高汉字的教学效率，这一点已经为过去的速成识字法以及现在小学的先教注音字母的经验所证明。希望拼音方案经过全国人民代表大会批准之后，小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本上就能用来给汉字注音，小学识字教育和文盲扫除工作将得到极大的便利，这是可以断言的。”
    用拼音字母扫盲可以提高效果，巩固成绩
    根据我们在各地看到的，用拼音字母帮助儿童认字和正音，成效一般良好。至于用拼音字母给汉字注音的办法来帮助扫盲（为了称说方便起见，这种扫盲的方法可以叫做“注音扫盲”），曾经在山东、河北、江苏三省作过试点，得到成功。
    拼音方案采用的是拉丁字母，这种字母对我国工农群众是生疏的，它能不能为群众所接受？我国人民没有拼音的习惯，工农群众要掌握这套字母和拼音方法，究竟有没有困难？扫盲工作中应用拼音字母究竟能不能收到成效？对于这几个问题，过去大家的看法是未必一致的。这三个省的试点，回答了以上三个问题。
    第一，拼音字母很受群众欢迎。山东、河北、江苏的群众，普遍认为拼音字母是“识字的法宝”，是“不说话的老师”；掌握字母以后，识字可以“无师自通”。山东省的群众说：“老师真正好，随身跟我跑，哪字不认得，快把它来找。”但是一开始，群众对拼音字母是有怀疑的，认为是洋文，学了没有用，对于练习发音，也不习惯。南京市栖霞山石埠寨的试点班，第一天上课，教第一个字母a，大家拼命笑。特别是妇女，怎么也不肯张嘴发音。有的人还说怪话，说像青蛙叫。河北省保定市完县区北下舒支部组织委员曹洛芬，今年五十四岁，他家两代都当长工。去年秋季曹洛芬学会拼音字母之后，因生产紧张，没有来得及进一步依靠字母学汉字。他现在虽然不识汉字，但能用拼音字母写作。他用拼音字母写了一首诗，从这首诗里可以看出一般工农群众对于拼音字母的心情：我的名叫曹洛芬，扛了长工十八春。剥削制度真难忍，阶级敌人是狼心。共产党来了咱翻身，苦命人变成幸福人。农业跃进再跃进，粮棉堆起顶破云。文化革命高潮起，汉语拼音称我心。老汉也要学文化，尽忠祖国报党恩。
    第二，群众学习拼音字母，并没有什么困难。山东省的经验，一个文盲或半文盲，一般只要十至十二小时可以学会。河北省的经验，一般学员经过七至十二次课（每次一小时至一个半小时）的学习之后，就能基本掌握。江苏省的两个试点班：一个用了十二个晚上，另外一个用了九个晚上（每晚约一个多小时），教会了拼音字母。群众学习拼音字母，一般有三个难点：（一）一部分复韵母特别是鼻韵母要用三个或四个字母组成，觉得长了；（二）两个半母音的用法复杂了一点；（三）有三个韵母，跟声母拼的时候，中间要省去一个字母。上述三点，目前只要求能正确读出来，不要求写得完全准确，因此困难不大。至于拼音字母的字形，虽然对群众是生疏的，但是因为一共只有二十六个，而且只教小楷，大楷和草书都不教，所以并不困难。字母的发音，在北方话区教学，也没有什么困难。现在是用来作识字的工具，某些音一时念不准，可以不必要求完全准确，对于识字并无妨碍。
    第三，拼音字母能够提高语文教学效率，巩固和扩大扫盲成果。群众学会拼音字母之后，不仅可以巩固已识的汉字，而且可以增识更多汉字，不断提高。例如江苏省新沂县新安镇理发店的十一个理发员，去年4月扫盲毕业。10月间学了拼音字母之后，每天阅读注音读物；写大字报，创作诗歌，写报告都加注拼音。最近通过逐人逐字检查，全组十一人，已在原有的二千字基础上，平均每人增识六百五十三个字。提高最多的翟兴华，增识了一千五百个字；最少的李学芹，增识了三百五十个字。他们现在都能看“新华日报”，读通俗读物，写信，记笔记。翟兴华在今年1月14日的“新华日报”上发表了他写的一篇文章，题目叫“学习汉语拼音字母帮我增识一千多字”。他写道：“学会拼音字母用处大极了，不认识的字，它会教你，不会写的字它能顶替；有一次我读‘刘介梅忘本回头’，碰上‘褴褛’两字，问很多人都不认识。后来查字典才拼出来是lanlou，而且知道是衣服破烂的意思。从前听报告，担心记不下来，学过拼音字母以后，胆量就大了。听报告能记就记，写不出汉字时就用拼音字母顶替。听完报告后，再查字典把汉字补出来。这样日子多了，不但巩固了原识的汉字，而且学会了许多生字。”河北省的经验，扫盲毕业的学员，经过一个月的学习，除了学会拼音字母，巩固已识的字之外，平均能增识五百多个汉字。
    注音扫盲还有个特点，就是便于群众自学。去年9月以后，由于生产任务紧张，多数地区的群众业余学习陷于停顿。但是仍有一部分学员，利用生产空隙，依靠拼音字母，坚持自学，不仅巩固了已有的成果，而且进一步有所提高。例如山东平原县大邢王庄扫盲毕业学员牛爱香、张秀珍，依靠拼音字母，把一千五百个字巩固住了。她们又利用生产间隙，刻苦自学，读完了注音的业余高小课本第一册。由于学习成绩好，现在牛爱香当上了业余高小班主课民师，张秀珍在业余高小班当辅导员。
    山东、河北、江苏三省的注音扫盲工作，尽管中间因生产紧张曾有几个月的中断，但是它的成效已经看得出来。拼音字母对扫盲确实有好处：质量比较好，特别有利于巩固，有利于提高。
    注音扫盲有没有什么害处，我想没有什么害处。有些人对注音扫盲有个顾虑，就是觉得既要学字母，又要学汉字，怕增加群众负担，拉长扫盲时间。去年扫盲，大家比速度，越比越快，因此总觉得教拼音字母要耽误事情。现在看来，这种顾虑是没有根据的。山东、河北等省的经验，一个文盲从学字母到扫盲毕业，不过一、两个月的时间。速度是重要的，但是必须在保证质量的基础上讲究速度，这才符合多快好省的原则。我想这一条可以算作我们去年扫盲工作的经验。再说，拼音字母除了作为扫盲工具以外，还有许多用处，例如查字典、学普通话，都需要应用拼音字母；代数、几何、物理、化学都离不开拼音字母，即拉丁字母。这套字母是现代世界各国每一个受中等教育的人所必须掌握的。因此结合扫盲教学拼音字母，决不能看作是增加一种额外负担。
    推广注音扫盲有没有困难？应该说有困难。这是一项新的工作，不能说完全没有困难。但是这些困难是容易克服的。怎样才能做好这项工作？根据江苏、河北、山东的经验，可以归纳为这样五条：第一，党委领导，书记挂帅。这是做好一切工作的关键，注音扫盲工作也是一样。江苏、山东、河北三省，凡是党委重视，加强领导的地方，都取得了比较显著的成绩。第二，深入宣传，发动群众。因为这是一项新的工作，必须向群众作好深入宣传，把拼音字母的效用和学习的目的说清楚，消除各种误解和怀疑，并大搞群众运动，造成声势。第三，结合生产，统一安排。在教学形式和时间安排上，要密切结合生产，结合政治运动，结合中心工作，统一安排，以贯彻为生产、为政治服务的方针。第四，培养骨干，训练师资。必须抽调一批扫盲干部，加以训练，然后由他们回去训练民师。各省市中小学教员大部分都学过拼音字母，也可以运用他们的力量来训练辅导民师。第五，编印教材，供应读物。要编印拼音字母读本、注音的扫盲课本和业余高小课本，并供应汉字和拼音字母对照的注音读物。
    目前山东、河北、江苏三省一共有三百万工农群众已经学过和正在学习拼音字母。河南、辽宁、黑龙江等省也正在大力开展注音扫盲工作。北京市市郊的一个乡也在进行试点。我们认为，除了少数民族语区、江苏的一部分、浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、广西的一部分等汉语方言区以外，全国其他各省都属于北方话区，即所谓“官话区”，在语音上跟普通话差别不大，完全可以适用这个办法。福建语音虽然跟普通话距离很远，但是由于某些有利条件，他们的扫盲大部分是用普通话进行的，看来也能适用这个办法。其他方言区扫盲能否适用，可以先行试点，如果证明有效，再行逐渐推广。至于方言区已经脱盲的群众，我以为可以教学拼音字母，这样一方面帮助他们继续提高，另一方面便于他们学习普通话。
    推广普通话在某些地区已经逐渐成为社会风气
    在过去的一年中，全国好些地区，如福建、广东、江苏、上海等省市和安徽的歙县，山东的邹平、范县，河北的河间、保定，河南的叶县、登封，辽宁的开原、庄河，黑龙江的拜泉、通河，吉林的四平，山西的临猗等市县在推广普通话方面，作了不少工作，成绩很大。福建、广东是我国方言最复杂的地区，过去外省干部到那里工作，必须由懂本地话的人充当翻译。开各种会议，由于语言隔阂，浪费许多时间，往往上午做报告，下午要用各种方言翻译一遍。去年大跃进以后，情况已有很大改变。首先中小学除偏僻地区外，一般都已经开始用普通话教学。更重要的是普通话已经出了学校的大门，开始向社会推广，而且农村比城市积极，劲头很大。特别在福建，学普通话，讲普通话已经逐渐成为社会风气，在许多人民公社里，普通话相当普遍。江苏省在昆山、新沂、金坛、丰县、江浦、溧阳、武进、江阴等县的大部分青壮年中以大搞群众运动的方法，推行了拼音字母和推广了普通话，取得了很大的成功。
    特别自大跃进以来，形势发展一日千里，党在每个阶段的方针任务，需要迅速和群众见面，做到党委一声号召，群众风起云涌。在这种情况下，推广普通话的需要就更加迫切。自1958年下半年起，福建、广东、江苏等省的好些县市，结合生产大跃进，采取大搞群众运动的方式，大力推广普通话。现在这些地区的青壮年中，已有很大一部分，开始能讲能听普通话。这是1958年在推广普通话工作方面出现的一个新形势。福建省的群众，认为普通话有十大好处：（一）加强干部团结好（指本地干部和外来干部）；（二）密切干群关系好（指外来干部和当地群众）；
  （三）提高政治觉悟好（指能听懂报告、广播）；（四）便利交流经验好；（五）转移社会风气好；（六）学习文化方便好；（七）便利日常生活好；（八）加强人民团结好；（九）适应跃进形势好；（十）促进文字改革好。因此，推广普通话已经成为这些地区领导和群众的一致要求。
    推广普通话也要结合生产和走群众路线
    去年推广普通话工作，所以能够取得这样大的成绩，除了各级党委的支持和群众的要求之外，还由于走了群众路线和密切结合生产。例如，江苏昆山县推广普通话缺乏教材，发动群众之后，群众自编自印课本八万八千八百七十六册，拼音字母表八万四千七百二十张，普通话和昆山话对照表二十三万九千三百四十张，还创造了四十余种教具。广东揭阳县编印汉语拼音课本二十万册，公社编的会话课本，印发了二十六万四千多册。在结合生产方面，各地创造了许多经验。事实证明，学习普通话完全可以跟生产结合。江苏新沂县棋盘大营的水利工地上，抬土、挖土、打夯时用普通话唱小调，打号子，群众感到很大兴趣。江苏丰县运河工地上，用拼音字母歌代替号子，教员用普通话叫喊鼓动口号。山东邹平县，推广普通话的工作跟赛诗相结合，农民诗人们用普通话来朗诵自己的诗篇。好些地区推广普通话还跟群众的文化学习相结合，用拼音字母来帮助提高群众的文化水平，收到了显著的成效。
    从福建、广东、江苏的情况看来，在方言地区，采用书记挂帅，大搞群众运动的办法来大力推广普通话，可以收到很大成效。但在另一方面，使用方言是人民长时期的习惯，普及普通话是一项长期的、艰巨的任务。因此，群众运动必须跟经常工作相结合，必须注意教好拼音字母，来巩固提高普通话的质量。现在有些地区，规定普及普通话的时间太短太急，我看可以适当放长。光靠一个突击运动，在青壮年中实现“普通话化”，这种想法是不现实的。必须建立经常工作，必须采取巩固措施，宁愿步子放慢一点，要把这项工作放在一个确实可靠的基础上。在方言区推广普通话，对不同对象应有不同的要求，在开始的时候，要求必须放低。在工人农民中间只求大体上能听能讲普通话，首先普及，然后逐步提高。推广普通话应该采取多种多样的方式，主要要根据需要和自愿，应该大力提倡，并用观摩、评比、竞赛等各种方法来加以鼓励，不要采取强制的方式。应当指出，推广普通话并不是要废除方言，应当容许在推广普通话的同时，本地区的人们仍然可以使用方言。至于各地小学、中学和师范学校教学拼音字母和普通话的工作，必须注意继续巩固提高，使学生们都能熟练掌握拼音字母和使用纯正的普通话。学校仍然是推广普通话的重要阵地，不可放松。
    根据以上的情况，我们有这样的体会：用汉语拼音字母来帮助巩固扫盲成果和推广普通话，已经开始收到成效，并且受到广大工农群众欢迎。希望各省、市、自治区，根据自己的情况和需要，大家都来大力宣传，大力推行拼音字母，在北方话区，即所谓“官话区”，可以主要用来巩固和扩大扫盲成果，在方言区，可以主要作为推广普通话的工具。少奇同志在八大二次会议的工作报告中提出“积极地进行汉字的改革”，作为当前文化革命的主要任务之一。我们要在十五年、二十年或者更多一些的时间内把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，必须争取在比较短的时间内实现文化革命，提高广大人民群众的文化水平，并实现汉语的规范化——在汉族人民中基本普及普通话。因此，在广大群众中大力推行拼音字母，帮助学习文化和统一语言，正是我国社会主义建设的一个重要组成部分。
