    Summarizing the Creative Experiences of Worker-Peasant Authors

    Summarizing the creative experiences of outstanding worker-peasant authors, analyzing and introducing their works, is an effective method to help them gradually improve on their existing creative level. The Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and the "Yan River" monthly magazine have done some work in this area. They adopted a method combining authors, the masses, and critics, and successively introduced in "Yan River" how the peasant poets of Bai Miao Village, a poetry village famous in Shaanxi, started writing poems (August 1958 issue); and published the poems of Gao Xueli, a sixteen-year-old peasant poet from Weinan County, and his writing process (November 1958 issue). In particular, the February issue this year published a special collection, "The Farmer Poet Wang Laojiu and His Poems," which included Wang Laojiu's poems and his writing "Talking About My Creation and Life," a record of "Bai Miao Village Peasant Poets' Discussion of Wang Laojiu's Poems," and articles by comrades Yan Ge and Hu Cai, such as "Drawing Nourishment from Wang Laojiu's Poems" and "Reading the Poems of Farmer Poet Wang Laojiu." These introductions allow us to understand how an ordinary farmer has grown into an excellent farmer poet under the constant cultivation of the Party and his own hard work. The masses love this farmer poet, Wang Laojiu, who has a wealth of life experience, hates the old society, and loves the Party and the new China, and they love his poems. The peasant poets of Bai Miao Village carefully read Wang Laojiu's poems, praising them for "speaking beautifully and sounding flavorful. Every sentence speaks to the heart." They conducted a detailed analysis and study of the ideological content and expressive techniques of Wang Laojiu's poems. This not only helped the author improve his understanding and summarize his creative experience, encouraging creative enthusiasm, but also inspired and encouraged other mass authors.

    总结工农作者创作经验
    总结优秀的工农作者的创作经验，分析和介绍他们的作品，是帮助他们在现有的创作水平上逐步提高的有效方法之一。中国作家协会西安分会和“延河”月刊在这方面进行了一些工作。他们采用作者、群众、评论家三结合的办法，在“延河”上陆续介绍了陕西远近闻名的诗歌村——白庙村的农民诗人们怎样作起诗来的（1958年8月号）；发表了渭南县十六岁的农民诗人高学礼的诗作和他的写作过程（1958年11月号）。特别是今年2月号上，出了“农民诗人王老九和他的诗”的专辑，刊登了王老九的诗和他写的“谈谈我的创作和生活”、“白庙村农民诗人座谈王老九的诗”的记录、严戈和胡采同志的“从王老九的诗中汲取营养”、“读农民诗人王老九的诗”等文章。这些介绍，使我们了解到一个普通农民在党的不断培养和自己的刻苦努力下，如何成长为一个优秀的农民诗人。群众喜爱这位有着丰富的生活经历，痛恨旧社会，热爱党和新中国的农民诗人和他的诗。白庙村的农民诗人们仔细读了王老九的诗，赞扬它“说的美，听起来有味。句句话说到人的心坎上”。他们对王老九的诗的思想内容表现技巧，进行了细致的分析和研究。这样不但帮助作者提高了认识，总结了创作经验。鼓舞了创作热情，而且使其他的群众作者也能受到启发和鼓励。
