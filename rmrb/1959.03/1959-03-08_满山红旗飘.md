    Red Flags Flutter All Over the Mountains
    ·Long· There are fine birds in the high mountains, and heroes emerge from the forests. The horn of the Great Leap Forward sounds, and red flags flutter all over the mountains. Swinging axes to move heaven and earth, trees fall and clouds and mists dissipate. Timber rides the water downstream, and spring breeze transmits the good news.

    满山红旗飘
   ·龙·高山有俊鸟，林中出英豪，跃进号角响，满山红旗飘。抡斧动天地，树倒云雾消，木材乘水下，春风传捷报。
