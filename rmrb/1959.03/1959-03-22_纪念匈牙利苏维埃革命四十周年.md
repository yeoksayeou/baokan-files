Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Revolution
Jiang Chunfang

    The imperialist World War of 1914-1918 created a revolutionary situation worldwide. The great October Socialist Revolution directly promoted a revolutionary crisis on a world scale. This revolutionary crisis reached its peak in Western and Central Europe from 1918 to 1921. During this period, following the Russian October Revolution, there were the German November Revolution, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Hungarian Soviet Revolution, and the strike struggles of workers in Italy, England, and France. This huge revolutionary wave shook the world with overwhelming force. In this great revolutionary wave, the Hungarian proletarian revolution was the first to bravely and directly adopt the experience of the October Revolution and take the path of the Bolsheviks towards socialism. The great Lenin gave the Hungarian Revolution a very high evaluation, saying: "The role of the Hungarian revolution in history may be even greater than that of the Russian revolution. This cultured country absorbed all the experiences of the Russian revolution, resolutely implemented socialization, and built the edifice of socialism on a better foundation and in a more planned and smooth manner."
    A strong working class and the struggle of the working masses had already become a revolutionary tradition in Hungary. As early as 1868, Hungary established the first socialist workers' organization and participated in the First International; during the Paris Commune revolution in 1871, Hungarian workers expressed their enthusiastic response through demonstrations and strikes. The growth of the Hungarian proletarian revolutionary forces, although later suppressed by the reformists of the Second International, was still able to break through various difficulties and carry out revolutionary struggles. For example, a large-scale May Day strike and demonstration was held in 1890, and an unprecedented political strike and demonstration was held in 1905 in response to the first Russian revolution. In 1912, the Hungarian proletariat held a political general strike against the monarchy, which later developed into street battles in Budapest. Shortly after the October Revolution, in January 1918, Hungarian workers and German and Austrian workers held strikes simultaneously to protest the predatory treaty conditions proposed by Germany and Austria-Hungary to Soviet Russia. In February, sailors of the Adriatic Fleet revolted, in June a wave of strikes swept the country, and in November the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the proletariat, completed the bourgeois democratic revolution. In November 1918, the Hungarian working class learned from the example of the Russian proletariat and established the Communist Party.
    The proletarian revolution of 1919 was led by the Hungarian Communist Party, headed by Béla Kun, a heroic soldier of the proletariat. Comrade Béla Kun was praised by Lenin as "a communist who has completely traversed the practical path of Russian Bolshevism."
    One of the major international significances of the Hungarian revolution forty years ago is that it showed that the common laws of proletarian revolution must be combined with the specific conditions of the country. The methods of the Hungarian revolution were completely different from those of Russia, which shows that other countries may also achieve the same goal through other methods, but the establishment of Soviet-style worker-peasant power and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat are common laws that any country must abide by. Lenin said: "The example of Hungary will be of decisive significance to the proletarian masses, to the proletariat and working peasants of Europe" because "nowhere in the world is it possible to have a government that is supported by the working people led by the proletariat, except for Soviet power, except for the dictatorship of the proletariat." The form of Hungary's transition to the dictatorship of the proletariat is different from that of Russia, and other countries may be different from both Russia and Hungary, "which is why the example of Hungary is of decisive significance." Lenin's exposition on the Hungarian revolution contains important ideas on how to combine the common truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of different countries.
    As soon as the Hungarian March Revolution occurred, the Chinese people, especially the revolutionary intellectuals, watched its development with great excitement. The news of the outbreak of the Hungarian revolution, the news of the various revolutionary measures of the Soviet government led by Comrade Béla Kun, were closely watched by progressive people in various parts of China at that time, and many articles expressing enthusiastic sympathy were published in newspapers and periodicals.
    At that time, the famous revolutionary newspaper "Weekly Review" in Beijing pointed out in the "Review of Foreign Affairs" on April 6, 1919, that the Allied Powers attempted to establish a neutral zone in Hungary to prevent the revolutionary wave led by the Russian Bolsheviks from spreading to Western Europe. Who knew that Bolshevism had infected Hungary first, and a Soviet government was established in Hungary, declaring that "domestic property, minerals, industry, banks, and transportation must be owned jointly by the people" and announced joint action with the Russian Bolsheviks. On April 13 of the same year, the publication published the declaration of the Hungarian Soviet government, detailing the revolutionary measures of the new Hungarian government, pointing out that this revolution was supported by the people. On April 20, it also pointed out that the Hungarian worker-peasant revolution, like the Russian October Revolution, was "the most valuable event in political history."
    On April 5, 1919, the Beijing "Morning Post" published the full text of the declaration of the Hungarian Soviet government. On June 20 and 22, it published a long article entitled "The Red Revolution in Hungary," reviewing the process of the Hungarian proletarian revolution and introducing the life of the Hungarian revolutionary leader Béla Kun (then translated as Bila Kang). The "Morning Post" believed that the impact of the Hungarian revolution was worldwide; it said that "it is difficult to predict whether Béla Kun's future governance will be fully successful, but it is an undeniable fact that the impact of the Red Revolution will spread globally. The Red Revolution thought was previously confined to Northern Russia, but now that it has been implemented in Central Europe, Italy, Germany, France, Sweden and other countries are geographically close, and will inevitably be thrown into the whirlpool."
    The first issue of "Zhengheng" in Shanghai published the full text of the "Constitution of the Hungarian Soviet Federal Republic," with eighty-nine articles. The fourth issue of the "Beijing University Student Weekly" was entitled "Comments on the Hungarian Constitution" and introduced the advantages of the Constitution of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.
    Comrade Mao Zedong warmly praised the Hungarian revolution in the articles he published in the "Xiangjiang Review," which he edited.
    The Hungarian Soviet Revolution of 1919 was strangled by the armed intervention of imperialism. World imperialism never misses any opportunity to eliminate the revolutionary struggle and revolutionary fruits of the working class. However, the revolutionary cause of the working class is becoming more and more consolidated and expanded. The Soviet people defeated the armed intervention of imperialism and defended the fruits of the October Revolution. Although the Hungarian revolution of forty years ago was destroyed, 14 years ago, with the help of the Soviet army, Hungary was liberated again, and the Hungarian People's Republic was quickly established. The Hungarian people victoriously launched socialist construction, and achieved great achievements in industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings. The imperialist aggressor forces, fearing the development of socialism, once carried out instigation and sabotage in Hungary in 1956, creating a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, but because the Hungarian people learned from the experience of past revolutionary struggles and recognized that imperialism was their mortal enemy, they carried out a heroic struggle with the assistance of the Soviet Union, thoroughly crushing the counter-revolutionary restoration, and defending the Hungarian People's Republic and the achievements of socialism. After the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quelled, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, the economy was rapidly restored. The Hungarian people have achieved encouraging achievements in industrial and agricultural and cultural construction. The recent leap in agricultural collectivization is a great victory for the Hungarian people in the socialist struggle.
    In the heroic struggle to establish and defend the Soviet Republic forty years ago, the Hungarian working class demonstrated its glorious revolutionary tradition and raised the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism. Today, it is carrying out brave and selfless labor to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, accelerate the construction of socialism, and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people praised the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Hungarian working people forty years ago, and today they are inspired by the creative labor of the Hungarian people. The people of China and Hungary have a deep friendship. The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the goal of building socialism closely link our two countries together. In recent years, our two countries have supported each other and cooperated closely in various aspects of politics, economy, and culture, and have achieved major achievements. We are very grateful to the Hungarian people for the assistance they have given to our country's socialist construction. We are willing to work with the Hungarian people to continue to develop the friendly cooperation between our two countries and strive for our common cause of communism.

    纪念匈牙利苏维埃革命四十周年
    姜椿芳
    1914—1918年帝国主义世界大战在全世界造成了革命形势。伟大的十月社会主义革命直接推进了世界规模的革命危机。这个革命危机，在西欧和中欧，于1918—1921年达到了最高点。在这段时期中，紧跟在俄国十月革命之后接连发生了德国十一月革命、奥匈帝国的崩溃、匈牙利苏维埃革命、意大利和英、法的工人罢工斗争，这个巨大的革命浪潮，以排山倒海之势，震撼全世界。在这巨大的革命浪潮中，匈牙利的无产阶级革命，是第一个勇敢地直接采用十月革命的经验，按照布尔什维克的道路走向社会主义的革命。伟大的列宁给予匈牙利革命以极高的评价，他说：“匈牙利革命在历史上所起的作用也许比俄国革命更大。这个有文化的国家吸取俄国革命的全部经验，坚决实行社会化，并在更好的基础上，更有计划地顺利地盖起社会主义的大厦”。
    强大的工人阶级，工人群众的斗争，当时已成为匈牙利的革命传统。远在1868年，匈牙利就建立了最初的社会主义工人团体，参加了第一国际；在1871年巴黎公社革命时期，匈牙利工人就以游行示威和罢工来表示热烈响应。匈牙利无产阶级革命力量的成长，虽然后来受到第二国际改良主义者的压抑，但仍能冲破种种困难；进行革命斗争，例如1890年曾举行大规模的五一罢工和游行示威，1905年曾举行规模空前的政治罢工和游行示威，响应俄国的第一次革命。1912年匈牙利无产阶级曾举行反对君主制度的政治大罢工，后来并在布达佩斯发展为街垒战。十月革命发生后不久，在1918年1月，匈牙利工人和德奥工人阶级同时举行罢工，抗议德国和奥匈帝国向苏俄提出的强盗式的和约条件，2月亚德里亚海舰队水兵起义，6月罢工浪潮普及全国，11月匈牙利人民在无产阶级领导下完成了资产阶级民主革命。1918年11月，匈牙利工人阶级学习俄国无产阶级榜样，成立了共产党。
    1919年的无产阶级革命，就是以无产阶级英勇的战士贝拉·库恩为首的匈牙利共产党所领导的。贝拉·库恩同志被列宁誉为“是一位完全走过了俄国布尔什维主义的实际道路的共产党员”。
    四十年前匈牙利革命的重大国际意义之一，是它表明无产阶级革命的共同规律必须和本国特殊条件相结合。匈牙利革命的方式和俄国的截然不同，这说明别的国家也可能通过别的方式达到同样目的，但建立苏维埃式的工农政权，建立无产阶级专政，则是任何国家必须遵守的共同规律。列宁说：“匈牙利的例子对无产阶级群众，对欧洲的无产阶级和劳动农民将具有决定意义”，因为，“现在除了苏维埃政权而外，除了无产阶级专政而外，世界上任何地方不可能有一种政权是得到以无产阶级为首的劳动者拥护的”。匈牙利过渡到无产阶级专政的形式既与俄国不同，其他国家也可能与俄国和匈牙利都不同，“这就是为什么匈牙利的例子具有决定的意义”。列宁在匈牙利革命问题上的这些阐述。包含着怎样把马克思列宁主义的共同真理和不同国家的具体实践相结合的重要思想。
    匈牙利三月革命一发生，中国人民，特别是革命知识分子就怀着极大的兴奋注视它的发展。关于匈牙利革命爆发的消息，关于贝拉·库恩同志所领导的苏维埃政府的种种革命措施的消息，当时中国各地进步人士是极为注意的，报刊上发表了不少热烈同情的文章。
    当时北京著名的革命报刊“每周评论”在1919年4月6日的“国外大事述评”中指出，协约国企图在匈牙利建立中立地带，以阻止俄国布尔什维克领导的革命浪潮向西欧泛滥，谁知道布尔什维主义反而先传染了匈牙利，在匈牙利成立了宣布“国内的财产、矿产、工业、银行、交通均须归人民共同所有”的苏维埃政府，并宣布同俄国布尔什维克共同行动。同年4月13日该刊发表了匈牙利苏维埃政府的宣言，详细介绍了匈牙利新政府的革命措施，指出这次革命是得到人民拥护的。4月20日还指出：匈牙利的工农革命，也和俄国十月革命一样，是“政治史上算得顶有价值的事体”。
    1919年4月5日北京“晨报”发表匈牙利苏维埃政府宣言的全文，6月20日，22日以“匈牙利之赤革命”为题，连载长文，评述匈牙利无产阶级革命的经过，并介绍匈牙利革命领袖贝拉·库恩（当时译为毕拉康）的生平。“晨报”认为，匈牙利革命所发生的影响，是世界规模的；它说贝拉·库恩“今后施政能否完全奏功，目下难逆睹·然赤革命影响之波及全球则为不可掩之事实，盖赤革命思想从前不过偏于北俄，今既实行于中欧，则意、德、法、瑞等国地理接近，浸假亦必投入游涡”。
    上海“政衡”第一期，发表“匈牙利苏维埃联邦共和国宪法”全文八十九条。“北京大学学生周刊”第四号以“匈牙利宪法的评论”为题；介绍匈牙利苏维埃共和国的宪法的优点。
    毛泽东同志在他主编的“湘江评论”上所发表的文章中，热情地赞扬了匈牙利革命。
    1919年匈牙利苏维埃革命是被帝国主义的武装干涉所扼杀的。世界帝国主义从来不放过每一个机会来消灭工人阶级的革命斗争和革命果实。然而工人阶级的革命事业愈来愈巩固和扩大。苏联人民战胜了帝国主义的武装干涉，保卫了十月革命的果实。四十年前匈牙利的革命虽然被摧毁，但在14年前，在苏联军队帮助之下，匈牙利又获得了解放，并且很快地成立了匈牙利人民共和国，匈牙利人民胜利地展开社会主义建设，工农业生产和文化教育事业都获得巨大的成就。惧怕社会主义发展的帝国主义侵略势力曾经在1956年向匈牙利进行挑拨离间和阴谋破坏，在匈牙利制造反革命叛乱，但是由于匈牙利人民吸取过去革命斗争的经验，认清帝国主义是自己的死敌，在苏联的援助下，进行了英勇的斗争，彻底粉碎了反革命的复辟，保卫了匈牙利人民共和国，保卫了社会主义的成果。在反革命叛乱被平服以后，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，迅速恢复了经济。匈牙利人民在工农业和文化建设方面取得了令人鼓舞的成就。最近农业合作化的飞跃发展，尤其是匈牙利人民在社会主义斗争中的伟大胜利。
    匈牙利工人阶级在四十年前为建立和保卫苏维埃共和国的英勇斗争中，显示了自己光荣的革命传统，举起了伟大的马克思列宁主义的红旗。今天，又正为巩固无产阶级专政、加紧建设社会主义和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结进行着勇敢的忘我的劳动。中国人民在四十年前歌颂了匈牙利劳动人民英勇的革命斗争，今天正从匈牙利人民的创造性的劳动中得到鼓舞。中匈两国人民有着深厚的友谊。马克思列宁主义的伟大思想，无产阶级的国际主义和建设社会主义的目标，把我们两国紧紧地联系在一起。近年来，我们两国在政治上、经济上和文化上各个方面，互相支持，密切合作，取得了重大成就。我们十分感谢匈牙利人民对我国建设社会主义事业所给予的帮助。我们愿意同匈牙利人民一起，继续发展我们两国之间的友好合作，为我们共同的共产主义事业而奋斗。
