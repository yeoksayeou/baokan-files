    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 6th: The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held a plenary session on March 4th and 5th.

    At the Central Committee plenary session, Central Political Bureau Alternate Member Jankovcova delivered a report on further improving living standards, Central Committee Secretary Černík delivered a report on housing construction issues, and Central Committee Secretary Krutina delivered a report on further developing agricultural production. The Central Committee plenary session passed corresponding resolutions on the above issues.

    First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Novotný, in his opening speech, spoke about the main conclusions of the nationwide discussion and the experience of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

    The resolution on improving people's living standards stated that the entire party and the vast majority of residents expressed great interest in this nationwide discussion. The working people unanimously agreed that the Central Committee's letter clearly demonstrated the correctness of the party's policy and its concern for improving people's living standards.

    The resolution emphasized that a noteworthy feature of this discussion was that everyone not only unanimously agreed on measures to improve living standards but also criticized the shortcomings that are still hindering our country's economic development. Therefore, this discussion was an important lesson for the masses, practically realizing the principle of enhancing the role of the working people in managing the national economy.

    The resolution stated that this discussion fully proved that at the current stage of building a socialist society, it is necessary to correctly adhere to the principle of distribution according to work. The significant suggestions made in the discussion regarding this will be adopted during the wage system reform this year.

    The Central Committee decided to take the following measures to further improve the people's living standards:

    1.  From March 8th of this year, reduce the state-stipulated retail prices of consumer goods. The working people will benefit 2.3 billion crowns from this price reduction. The commodities with reduced prices are basic food and textiles, as well as some high-end consumer goods.

    2.  From April 1st, increase subsidies for families with three or more children. The annual increase will reach 500.2 million crowns. The amount of the increase will depend on the parents' wage income.

    3.  From April 1st of this year, increase the pensions and preferential payments for workers registered before January 1st, 1957, to at least 400 crowns per person per month. In the future, pensions and preferential payments will continue to increase with the development of socialist economic construction.

    The Central Committee believes that it is possible to continue shortening working hours during the Third Five-Year Plan period. The resolution stated that measures to shorten working hours will be implemented gradually, first in mines and enterprises in major sectors.

    The Central Committee also passed resolutions on organizational structure and personnel, including a suggestion that the government establish a State Planning Commission headed by a Deputy Prime Minister, and suggesting the appointment of O. Šimůnek as Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, and the appointment of R. Barák as Deputy Prime Minister.

    The Party Central Committee elected L. Štrougal as Secretary of the Central Secretariat.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 8th: "Red Right" newspaper today published the resolution on solving the housing problem passed by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party at its meeting on March 4th and 5th.

    The resolution stipulates that 1.2 million housing units will be built by 1970 to solve the current housing shortage in Czechoslovakia. The resolution emphasized that this task can be solved due to the development of the Czechoslovak national economy and the superiority of the socialist system.

    The resolution emphasized that in completing the above housing construction tasks, in addition to housing construction mainly by the state and enterprises, it is also necessary to pay attention to organizing people's housing cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and individuals to build houses with the help of state subsidies and loans.

    The resolution stipulates that priority must be given to housing construction in the Karlovy Vary region, the Ústí region, and the Ostrava region.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 7th: According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak government has decided to reduce the retail prices of consumer goods again (for the seventh time) on the basis of the achievements in developing the national economy, especially industrial production. The decision to reduce prices took effect on March 8th, 1959.

    再次降低物价　大力兴建住宅
    捷进一步提高人民生活水平
    捷共中央全会通过重要决议
    据新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在3月4日和5日举行全体会议。
    在中央全会上，中央政治局候补委员扬科夫卓娃作了关于进一步提高生活水平的报告，中央委员会书记切尔尼克作了有关住宅建设问题的报告，中央委员会书记克鲁蒂纳作了关于进一步发展农业生产的报告。中央全会就上述问题通过了相应的决议。
    捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼在致开幕词中谈到了全民讨论的主要结论，以及苏共第二十一次代表大会的经验。
    关于提高人民生活水平问题的决议说，全党和绝大多数居民对于这次在全国范围内进行的讨论表示了很大的兴趣。劳动人民一致同意：中央委员会的信清楚地证明了党的政策的正确性和它对提高人民生活水平问题的关怀。
    决议强调指出，这次讨论的值得注意的特点是，大家不仅一致同意提高生活水平的措施，而且还批评了目前还在阻挠我国经济发展的缺点。因此，这次讨论对群众来说是上了重要的一课，它实际地实现了提高劳动人民在管理国民经济方面的作用这个原则。
    决议说，这次讨论充分证明，在建设社会主义社会的现阶段，必须正确地遵守按劳分配的原则。讨论中所提出的有关这方面的重大建议，将在今年实行工资制度改革时加以采纳。
    中央委员会决定采取下列措施来进一步提高人民的生活水平：
    一、从今年3月8日起减低国家规定的消费品零售价格，劳动人民将从这次减价中获益二十三亿克朗。减低价格的商品是基本食品和纺织品，以及一些高级消费品。
    二、从4月1日起，增加对有三个以上子女的家庭的补助费，全年增加额达五亿零二百万克朗。增加的多少将视家长工资收入而定。
    三、从今年4月1日起，把1957年1月1日以前登记的职工的养老金和优抚金至少增加到每人每月四百克朗。今后养老金和优抚金将随着社会主义经济建设的发展而继续增加。
    中央委员会认为，在第三个五年计划时期内，继续缩短工作时间是可能的。决议说，缩短工作时间的措施将逐步实行，首先是在主要部门的矿坑和企业中实行。
    中央委员会还通过了关于组织机构和人事方面的决议，其中建议政府成立一个以一位副总理为首的国家计划委员会，并建议任命奥·西穆?克为副总理兼国家计划委员会主席，任命鲁·巴拉克为副总理。
    党中央委员会选举卢·斯特劳加尔为中央书记处书记。
    据新华社布拉格8日电　“红色权利报”今天刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在3月4日和5日举行的会议上通过的关于解决住宅问题的决议。
    决议规定到1970年建成一百二十万套住宅，以解决目前捷克斯洛伐克住宅不够的问题。决议强调指出，这个任务之所以能够解决是由于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展和社会主义制度的优越性。
    决议强调说，在完成以上住宅建设任务时，除了主要由国家和企业建设住宅外，还必须注意，在国家津贴和贷款的帮助下，组织人民住房合作社、农业合作社和个人来建造房屋。
    决议规定必须优先注意卡罗维发利区、乌斯蒂区和俄斯特拉发区的住宅建设。
    新华社布拉格7日电　根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会的决议，捷克斯洛伐克政府决定在发展国民经济，特别是工业生产取得成就的基础上再一次（第七次）减低消费品的零售价格。减低价格的决议从1959年3月8日起生效。
