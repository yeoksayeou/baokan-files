How is the Situation on the Water Conservancy Front?
By a commentator of this newspaper

After Jiangxi Province withdrew a large number of laborers from water conservancy construction sites to invest in fertilizer accumulation and production, water conservancy construction continued to advance by leaps and bounds. This fact powerfully answers the question of whether water conservancy construction can advance rapidly under the new situation. As everyone knows, because fertilizer accumulation and production, field management of summer harvest crops, sideline production, community-run industries, etc., all have to occupy a considerable part of the labor force, it will be impossible this year to concentrate as much labor force into water conservancy construction as last year. Under these circumstances, can the task of water conservancy construction be completed as scheduled? The news from Jiangxi Province shows: it certainly can!

Last winter and this spring, various regions have already made appropriate adjustments to water conservancy tasks based on the new situation of rural production. The reason for adjusting water conservancy tasks is to resolutely complete the most necessary water conservancy projects on the basis of ensuring the overall development of rural production and construction; it does not mean that water conservancy construction is no longer so important, and whether the task is completed or not is inconsequential.

How is the situation on the water conservancy front? There should be a correct understanding.

The water conservancy construction in 1958 achieved unprecedented great achievements: the irrigated area expanded by 480 million mu in one year, 210 million mu of low-lying land was transformed and waterlogging prevention was completed, and the preliminary controlled area of soil and water conservation reached 300,000 square kilometers. These projects played a huge role in ensuring the bumper harvest in 1958. So, is water conservancy construction now "almost done"? No, water conservancy construction must continue to move forward. After these years of water conservancy construction, China's waterlogging and drought disasters have been greatly reduced. However, last year there were still about 100 million mu of easily waterlogged cultivated land across the country, and there were still 1 million square kilometers of soil erosion area that had not been controlled. Last year, about 400 million mu of cultivated land suffered from waterlogging and drought disasters. After a tenacious struggle against the disaster, 100 million mu were still affected. It was only because of the great leap forward and bumper harvest in agriculture that this considerable disaster did not affect the overall situation. There was disaster last year, and no one can guarantee that there will be no major waterlogging and drought disasters this year. We must be prepared to prevent trouble before it happens. It should also be pointed out that the water storage capacity of the water conservancy projects built in the past is still far from enough. It is estimated that the northern provinces only account for 10% to 30% of the local runoff, and the southern provinces are even less than 10%. In addition, the development of irrigation is also uneven, and the proportion of irrigated area in cultivated land in some areas is still not large. These facts all show that water conservancy construction must continue its efforts and cannot be slackened. In order to complete the great task of producing 1,050 billion jin of grain and 100 million dan of cotton this year, the eight major measures for increasing production must be closely coordinated; therefore, the demand for water must also be increased accordingly. According to the experience of various regions, the amount of water required for the first irrigation of the land after deep plowing is about twice as much as before deep plowing; at the same time, as more fertilizer is applied, the amount and frequency of irrigation must also be increased accordingly. It should also be seen that not only agriculture needs water, but also forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, industry, shipping, etc. all need water; in short, the scope of water use is expanding more and more. We must meet the growing needs of various undertakings for water.

Now, the question before us is how to complete this year's water conservancy construction task with less labor. Is there a clever plan? There is no other way, only to do what Jiangxi Province did: unified scheduling of labor, conscientiously improving labor organization, strengthening ideological education, and carrying out a large-scale tool reform movement. Of course, these are not unique experiences of Jiangxi Province; however, it should be said that Jiangxi Province has done an excellent job in grasping these points. In December last year, Jiangxi withdrew 500,000 laborers from the 2.1 million laborers on the water conservancy construction front to support fertilizer accumulation work, and at the same time mobilized the people remaining on the water conservancy construction sites to launch a labor competition, so that the water conservancy construction movement continued to move forward. It is particularly worth noting that the tool reform movement in water conservancy construction in various parts of Jiangxi Province has been carried out vigorously and has yielded great results, so that hard work and skillful work are truly combined. To measure the success of tool reform, it is not only necessary to see how many new tools have been created, but more importantly, to see whether the advanced tools that have been created have been universally promoted and whether they have played a huge role in field operations. The outstanding feature of Jiangxi Province's water conservancy tool reform is that various advanced tools have been widely promoted. More than 4,200 factories for repairing and manufacturing tools and producing materials were established in various water conservancy construction sites throughout the province, supplying the tools and building materials required for construction in a timely manner. This approach is worth advocating. Precisely because of this, although the number of laborers on water conservancy construction sites throughout the province has been reduced by 500,000, the daily progress of water conservancy projects has doubled compared with the previous stage. Moreover, the quality of water conservancy projects built in various places is generally very good. This also shows that under the current situation, there is still great potential to be tapped in accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction.

From now until the busy spring plowing season, there is still some time. Various regions should seize this favorable opportunity, check and arrange the water conservancy work, muster all their energy, and take various active measures to accelerate the progress of water conservancy construction. For the most necessary projects that can be completed before the spring plowing, they should be built in a concentrated way, and strive to complete them before the spring plowing on the premise of ensuring project quality, so that most of the projects can play their benefits in the same year. In order to cooperate with spring plowing and field management of summer ripening crops, while carrying out water conservancy construction, it is also necessary to strengthen the inspection and repair of existing projects, water storage and conservation, and the renovation of field channels and land leveling, accelerate the improvement, manufacturing and repair of water lifting tools, and vigorously carry out spring irrigation, so that water conservancy facilities can give full play to their role in spring production.

    水利战线形势如何？
    本报评论员
    江西省从水利工地上抽走大批劳动力投入积肥造肥工作以后，水利建设仍然突飞猛进。这个事实，有力地回答了在新的形势下水利建设能不能迅速前进的问题。大家知道，由于积肥造肥、夏收作物田间管理、副业生产、社办工业等等都得占用相当大的一部分劳动力，今年已经不可能像去年那样集中那么多的劳动力投入水利建设。在这种情况下，水利建设的任务能不能如期完成呢？江西省的消息说明：一定能够！
    去冬今春，各地已经根据农村生产的新情况，把水利任务作了适当的调整。水利任务所以要调整，是为了在保证农村生产建设全面发展的基础上，坚决完成最必需完成的水利工程；决不是说水利建设不再那么重要了，任务完成与否无关紧要了。
    水利战线形势如何？应该有个正确的认识。
    1958年的水利建设获得了史无前例的伟大成就：一年之间灌溉面积扩大了四亿八千万亩，洼地改造和防涝完成了二亿一千万亩，水土保持初步控制面积达到了三十万平方公里。这些工程对于保证1958年大丰收，起了巨大的作用。那么，现在水利建设是否已经“差不多”了呢？不是的，水利建设必需继续向前发展。经过这几年的水利建设，我国的水旱灾害已经大大地减轻了。但是去年全国仍有一亿亩左右易涝的耕地，还有一百万平方公里的水土流失面积没有控制。去年约有四亿亩耕地遭受了水旱灾害，经过顽强的抗灾斗争，仍然有一亿亩成灾。只是因为全国农业大跃进、大丰收，这场相当大的灾害没有影响大局。去年有灾，今年谁也不能担保就不会发生较大的水旱灾害。我们必须有备才能无患。还应当指出，就是过去建成的水利工程，蓄水能力也还很不够，估计北方各省只占当地径流量的10％到30％，南方各省还不到10％。另外，灌溉事业的发展也不平衡，有些地区的灌溉面积在耕地中所占的比重还不大。这些事实都说明，水利建设必须再接再厉，不能松懈。为了完成今年生产一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担棉花等等伟大任务，必须使八大增产措施密切配合起来；因此，对于水的要求也要相应地提高。根据各地的经验，深翻后的土地第一次灌水需要的水量要比深翻前多一倍左右；同时，施肥多了，灌水的数量和次数也要随之增加。还要看到，不仅农业要水，林业、牧业、渔业、工业、航运等等也要水；总之，用水的范围越来越扩大。我们要满足各种事业对于水的日益增长的需要。
    现在，摆在我们面前的问题，是如何用较少的劳动力来完成今年的水利建设任务。有何妙计？没有别的，只有像江西省做的这样：统一调度劳动力，认真改进劳动组织，加强思想教育，大搞工具改革运动。当然，这些并不是江西省独有的经验；但是，应该说江西省抓这几条抓得很出色。去年12月，江西就从水利建设战线上的二百一十万劳动力中抽出了五十万人支援积肥工作，同时发动留在水利工地上的人们展开劳动竞赛，使水利建设运动继续前进。特别值得注意的是，江西省各地水利建设中的工具改革运动搞得有声有色，收获巨大，使苦干和巧干真正结合了起来。衡量工具改革成绩大小，不仅要看创造了多少新工具，更重要的是看已经创造的先进工具是不是普遍推广了，是不是在实地作业中发挥了巨大的作用。江西省的水利工具改革出色的地方，就在于各种先进工具推广得很普遍。全省各水利工地办起了四千二百多座修造工具和生产材料的工厂，及时供应施工所需要的工具和建筑材料。这个做法很值得提倡。正因为这样，虽然全省水利工地上的劳动力减少了五十万个，但是水利工程每天的进度，却比前一阶段增加了一倍。而且，各地建成的水利工程质量一般都很好。这也说明，在目前的情况下，在加快水利建设进度方面，仍然是大有潜力可挖的。
    从现在到春耕大忙，还有一段时间。各地应当抓紧这个有利时机，把水利工作检查一下，安排一下，鼓足干劲，采取各种积极措施，加快水利建设进度。对于那些春耕以前可能完成的最必需的工程，应当突击兴修，力争在保证工程质量的条件下，在春耕前完成，使大部分工程当年能够发挥效益。为了配合春耕和夏熟作物的田间管理，在水利施工的同时，还必须加强已有工程的检查修护、蓄水保水以及田间渠道的整修和土地平整工作，加紧改良制造和修理提水工具，大力开展春灌，使水利设施在春季生产中充分发挥作用。
