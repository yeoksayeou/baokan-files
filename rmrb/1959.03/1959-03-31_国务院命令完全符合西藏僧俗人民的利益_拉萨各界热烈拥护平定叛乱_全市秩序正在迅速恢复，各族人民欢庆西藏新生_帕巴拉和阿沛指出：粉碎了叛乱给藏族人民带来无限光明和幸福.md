Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 30th. People of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life, both monks and laypersons, in Lhasa warmly support the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, as well as the Tibet Military Region's proclamation on quelling the rebellion.

On the evening of March 28th, the Tibetan, Hui, and Han people of Lhasa City excitedly heard the State Council's order and the Xinhua News Agency's published communique on the radio. On the 29th, they saw the full text of the order and communique in the Tibetan and Han editions of the Tibet Daily. They all felt joyous and inspired. On the 29th, on Lhasa's busiest Barkhor Street, people scrambled to read the orders and communiques posted on the streets. When Tibetan people met each other, they exchanged greetings of "Tashi Delek" (good luck), many shops opened their doors, and many citizens got up early to sweep the streets and draw various auspicious patterns in white powder at their doorsteps.

Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, told reporters after listening to the State Council's order and the Xinhua News Agency's communique broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, that the Central government has always acted with a magnanimous attitude and repeatedly ordered the Tibetan local government to severely punish the rebels. However, the Tibetan local government acted against these orders, secretly gathering bandits, utterly failing to live up to the Central government's hopes. He said that after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet had strict discipline. They maintained the interests of the Tibetan people everywhere, protected the monasteries, protected cultural relics, and respected the religious beliefs and customs of the monks and lay people. However, the rebels were unscrupulous, wandering around, disrupting traffic, looting, killing, and harming the people. Now, these traitorous elements are finished. This is a new beginning for our Tibetan people to move towards prosperity, happiness, and socialist construction.

When reporters visited Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, he was excitedly reading the State Council's order and the communique issued by the Xinhua News Agency. He happily told reporters that the vast majority of Tibetan people are patriotic. We resolutely support the Central People's Government, love the People's Liberation Army, and oppose imperialism and traitorous elements. For the nine years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's meticulous care for the Tibetan people and their great ethnic equality and unity policies have been warmly loved by the vast majority of Tibetan people. Therefore, the conspiracy and rebellion of a small handful of reactionary elements could not gain support among the Tibetan people. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that the rebellion of the reactionary forces in Tibet and the complete failure of the rebellion means that the history of Tibet is starting a brand new page. The rebellion launched by the reactionary elements did not cause the division of the motherland and the regression of Tibet; on the contrary, it greatly promoted the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, thereby bringing boundless light and happiness to the broad masses of Tibetan people.

Wang Peisheng (Hui nationality), a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, expressed his complete support for the wise policies of the Central government. He pointed out that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can all ethnic minorities in the country obtain genuine liberation and happiness. He said: The vast majority of our Hui compatriots in Lhasa are patriotic, and all of our Hui people will certainly follow the Communist Party.

Tsekoe Deyang, a member of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, said that this rebellion by the reactionary elements and their failure made her more clearly recognize the hideous faces of imperialism and reactionary elements. She said: Seeing the happy future of Tibet, I sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 30th. Order in Lhasa is rapidly returning to normal. Lhasa, after the rebellion, has been cleaned up spotlessly. Shops are opening their doors one after another. Fresh spinach, bok choy, beef, and mutton can be bought at the vegetable market. Large carts carrying fertilizer are coming and going on the roads leading to the suburbs. Various organs and troops have resumed spring agricultural production. In the fields in the suburbs, Tibetan farmers have also begun plowing and watering. Some time ago, rebels did not allow Tibetan farmers to carry out spring plowing and sowing in a timely manner. Now, the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is preparing to provide assistance to the farmers. Impoverished citizens will also receive relief.

Linemen from the Lhasa Power Plant are busy re-erecting power lines. During the rebellion, the rebels frantically cut down the utility poles in the urban area. Medical personnel are busy treating citizens.

The loudspeakers of the Lhasa wired broadcasting station broadcast various calls from the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Military Control Commission. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion, the Tibet Military Region's proclamation, and the Xinhua News Agency's communique on the Tibetan rebellion incident are all posted on the streets, and people are gathered around reading them carefully.

Citizens are drawing various auspicious patterns in white powder on the doors of their homes. When they meet on the streets or encounter Tibetan and Han cadres, they happily exchange greetings of "Tashi Delek" (good luck), expressing their joy at being liberated from the disaster of the rebellion.

Flags symbolizing light and happiness, are fluttering in the sky over Lhasa, celebrating the rebirth of the ancient city of Lhasa.

    全市秩序正在迅速恢复，各族人民欢庆西藏新生
    帕巴拉和阿沛指出：粉碎了叛乱给藏族人民带来无限光明和幸福
    新华社拉萨30日电　拉萨各族各界僧俗人民热烈拥护国务院关于平息西藏叛乱、解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令，以及西藏军区关于平息叛乱的布告。
    拉萨市藏、回、汉族人民28日晚上兴奋地从收音机中听到了国务院的命令和新华社发表的公报，29日又从西藏日报藏文版和汉文版上看到命令和公报的全文，他们无不感到欢欣鼓舞。29日，在拉萨市最热闹的八角街上，人民争着阅读张贴在大街上的命令和公报。藏族人民见了面互道“扎喜德来”（吉祥如意），许多商店都开了门，很多市民大清早起来就打扫街道，并在大门口用洁白的白粉画上了各种吉祥的图案。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛在收听完中央人民广播电台播送的国务院命令和新华社公报后就对记者说，中央一贯本着宽大为怀的态度，一再责成西藏地方政府严惩叛乱分子。但西藏地方政府阳奉阴违，暗地纠集叛匪，根本辜负了中央的希望。他说，西藏和平解放后，进藏的人民解放军纪律严明，他们处处维护藏族人民的利益，保护喇嘛寺庙，保护文物古迹，尊重僧俗人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。而叛乱分子却肆无忌惮，到处窜扰，破坏交通，劫掠烧杀，残害人民。现在，这些叛国分子已经完蛋了，这是我们藏族人民走向繁荣幸福和进行社会主义建设的新开端。
    记者去访问西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美的时候，他正在兴奋地阅读国务院的命令和新华社发表的公报。他很高兴地向记者说，西藏广大人民是爱国的，我们坚决拥护中央人民政府，热爱解放军，反对帝国主义和叛国分子，西藏和平解放九年来，党中央和毛主席对藏族人民无微不至的关怀和伟大的民族平等、团结政策，受到了广大藏族人民的热烈爱戴，因而一小撮反动分子的阴谋叛乱，在藏族人民中得不到支持。阿沛·阿旺晋美说，西藏反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的彻底失败，使西藏的历史正在开始最新的一页，反动分子所发动的叛乱，没有造成祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，恰恰相反，而是大大促进了祖国的统一和民族团结，从而给广大的藏族人民带来了无限的光明和幸福。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会委员王沛生（回族）表示完全拥护中央的英明政策。他指出，全国各少数民族只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能获得真正的解放和幸福。他说：我们在拉萨的回族同胞绝大多数都是爱国的，我们全体回族人民一定跟着共产党走。
    拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会委员崔科·德扬说，反动分子这次的叛乱和他们的失败，使我更清楚地认清了帝国主义和反动分子的狰狞面目。她说：看到西藏幸福的明天，我衷心地感激共产党、毛主席。　　新华社拉萨30日电　拉萨市的秩序正在迅速恢复。经过叛乱的拉萨市已打扫得干干净净。商店陆续开门。菜市上可以买到新鲜的菠菜、小白菜和牛羊肉。通往市郊的公路上来往着运送肥料的大车。各机关、部队又恢复了春耕生产。市郊的田野上，藏族农民们也开始了翻地浇水。前些时间叛乱分子不准藏族农民及时春耕播种，现在中共拉萨市委正准备对农民给予帮助。贫苦市民也将得到救济。
    拉萨电厂的架线工人在忙碌着重新架设电线。在叛乱中，叛匪曾疯狂地砍断了市区的电线杆。医务人员在忙碌地为市民们治病。
    拉萨有线广播站的大喇叭播送出中共拉萨市委和军管会的各项号召。国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令、西藏军区的布告和新华社关于西藏叛乱事件的公报都张贴在大街上，人们围着仔细阅读。
    市民们用白粉在自己的家门画上各种吉祥的图案。他们在街道上见面或遇见藏、汉族干部时，都高兴地互道“扎喜德来”（吉祥如意），表示从叛乱的灾难中被解放出来的喜悦。
    一面面象征着光明、幸福的五星红旗，飘扬招展在拉萨市上空，庆祝拉萨古城的新生。
