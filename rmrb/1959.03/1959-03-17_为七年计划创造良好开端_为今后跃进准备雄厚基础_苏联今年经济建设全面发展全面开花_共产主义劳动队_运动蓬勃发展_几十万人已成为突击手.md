Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - This year is the first year of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan. In this year, all sectors of the Soviet national economy will achieve rapid development. Now, as spring arrives and all things are renewed, the working people of the Soviet Union have made vows to ensure that the first year of the Seven-Year Plan becomes a year of comprehensive development and blossoming for all sectors of the national economy.

The scale and speed of Soviet economic construction this year have been unprecedentedly increased. The iron and steel industry is the foundation of the development of the Soviet national economy, and investment in the development of this sector will increase by 30% this year. In order to increase steel production, the Soviet Union will build five new blast furnaces this year, three of which will be the largest in Europe. In terms of iron ore production, a series of new mines will be built this year, and the first phase of a large-scale concentrator will be put into production this year, and its products will fully meet the needs of the factories in the southern iron and steel industry base for iron ore.

This year, the Soviet power industry will also leap forward, with electricity generation increasing to 258 billion kilowatt-hours by the end of the year, an increase of 11% over last year. In order to gain time and catch up with the United States as soon as possible, in the power industry, thermal power plants will be vigorously built. Thermal power plants with a generating capacity of one million kilowatts will be established in many places. For example, the largest thermal power plant in Europe will be built in the Urals, and the generating capacity of its first turbine unit will reach 200,000 kilowatts. The construction of hydroelectric power stations that have already started will also be accelerated this year. The Kremechuk hydroelectric power station on the Dnieper River will begin generating electricity this year. The Stalingrad hydroelectric power station on the Volga River will supply electricity to Voronezh, Moscow and other places this year. The construction speed of the Bratsk hydroelectric power station in Siberia will also be accelerated.

1959 will be an important year in the leap-forward development of the Soviet oil and gas industry. Oil production will increase to more than 126.5 million tons this year, an increase of 12% over last year, and gas production will increase by more than 38% over last year. This year, large-scale exploration of gas resources will also be carried out, which is expected to increase the industrial reserves of gas by about 40%. Due to the large-scale construction of gas pipelines, 50 cities in the Soviet Union will receive gas supplies from new producing areas this year. Many large factories producing plastics, synthetic fibers, chemical fertilizers and synthetic rubber will also be put into production this year.

In terms of the machine manufacturing industry, the Soviet Union will manufacture many highly efficient machine equipment this year. It is expected that 156 automated or semi-automated production lines will be built this year, which is 20% more than last year. The production of chemical industrial machinery will increase by about 80%, and the production of electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives will increase by 37%.

The Soviet Union's agriculture has also formulated a huge plan this year. State farms and collective farms in many places have formulated specific measures to increase yield per unit area. In terms of livestock development, this year will be a year of rapid progress. As of March 1, the state has purchased 620,000 tons of meat and 2,020,000 tons of milk, an increase of more than 80% and 30% respectively over the same period last year.

In order to further improve people's lives, the Soviet Union's light industry and food industry will also advance rapidly this year. The production of silk fabrics containing rayon will double this year. The production of radios and televisions will also increase significantly.

The improvement of people's lives has a solid foundation. This year, the labor productivity of industrial sectors will generally increase. According to the plan, the labor productivity of each worker will increase by an average of 5.4% this year, and if converted into products, its value will reach more than 11 billion rubles.

Kuzmin, chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, said that 1959 is an important key in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. If the Seven-Year Plan is compared to a seven-stage rocket, then the 1959 stage will provide the rocket with sufficient power to enable it to orbit in space.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - The Soviet "Communist Labor Team" competition movement has continued to develop after the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Now the number of work teams participating in the competition has increased from 35,000 at the time of the 21st Congress to more than 60,000, and hundreds of thousands of people have become shock workers in this competition. They are formulating new competition plans for this year.

At present, the Soviet Union has conducted preliminary summaries of the competition in the past four months, and thousands of work teams have won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Team."

At the Moscow marshalling station on the Moscow-Ryazan railway line, where the competition was initiated, 21 work teams have participated in the competition, and one workshop and two locomotive groups have won the title of "Communist Labor Team."

This competition is different from the socialist labor competition. It not only requires participants to overfulfill the monthly target in production, and put forward more rationalization proposals, but also to live and study in accordance with communist requirements, to learn multiple skills, and to abide by communist morality. Therefore, wherever this competition is launched, new aspects have emerged in work, study and life.

    为七年计划创造良好开端　为今后跃进准备雄厚基础
    苏联今年经济建设全面发展全面开花
    “共产主义劳动队”运动蓬勃发展　几十万人已成为突击手
    新华社莫斯科16日电　今年是苏联七年计划的第一年。在这一年中，苏联国民经济各部门都将获得飞跃的发展。现在，当春临大地、万物复苏的时候，苏联各地的劳动人民都发出了誓言，保证要使七年计划的第一年成为国民经济各部门全面发展、全面开花的一年。
    今年苏联经济建设的规模和速度都空前提高了。钢铁工业是苏联国民经济发展的基础，今年用于发展这一部门的投资将增加30％。为了增加钢铁产量，苏联今年将建设五座新高炉，其中有三座将是欧洲最大的。在铁矿砂生产方面，今年将建设一系列新矿场，一个规模巨大的选矿厂的第一期工程今年将投入生产，它的产品将充分满足南方钢铁工业基地各工厂对铁矿砂的需要。
    今年苏联电力工业也将飞跃前进，发电量到年底将增加到二千五百八十亿度，即比去年增加11％。为了争取时间及早赶上美国，在电力工业方面将大力修建火力发电站，发电能力为一百万瓩的火力发电站将在许多地方建立起来。例如将在乌拉尔建成一座欧洲最大的火力发电站，它的第一台汽轮组的发电能力就达二十万瓩。已经动工的水电站今年也将加快建设，第聂伯河上的克列门楚格水电站今年将开始发电。伏尔加河上的斯大林格勒水电站今年将为沃罗涅日、莫斯科等地供应电力。西伯利亚的布拉次克水电站的建设速度也将加快。
    1959年将是苏联石油工业和瓦斯工业跃进发展中重要的一年。石油产量今年将增加到一亿二千六百五十万吨以上，比去年增加12％，瓦斯产量将比去年增加38％以上。今年还将大规模展开瓦斯资源的勘察工作，预计这将使瓦斯的工业蕴藏量增加40％左右。由于瓦斯管道的大量兴建，今年苏联将有五十个城市得到新产区的瓦斯供应。许多生产塑料、合成纤维、化学肥料和人造橡胶的大工厂今年也将投入生产。
    在机器制造业方面，苏联今年将制成许多生产效率极高的机器设备，预计今年将建造一百五十六部自动化或半自动化作业线，即比去年多20％。化学工业机器的生产将增加80％左右，电气机车和内燃机车的生产将增加37％。
    苏联的农业今年也制定了庞大的计划。许多地方的国营农场和集体农庄都订出了提高单位面积产量的具体措施。在畜牧业发展方面，今年将是突飞猛进的一年，到3月1日为止，国家已经收购了六十二万吨肉类和二百零二万吨牛奶，分别比去年同时期增多80％以上和30％。
    为了进一步改善人民生活，苏联的轻工业和食品工业今年也将迅速前进。含有人造丝成分的绸布生产今年将翻一番。无线电、电视机的生产也将大大增加。
    人民生活的提高是有稳固基础的。今年工业部门的劳动生产率将普遍提高，按照计划，今年一年内每个工人的劳动生产率将平均提高5.4％，如果折合成产品，那么它的价值将达到一百一十亿卢布以上。
    苏联国家计划委员会主席库兹明说，1959年是苏联七年计划中的一个重要关键，如果把七年计划比成七级火箭，那么1959年这一级将供给火箭以充足的动力，以便使它环行太空。
    新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联“共产主义劳动队”竞赛运动在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会以后继续向前发展，现在参加竞赛的工作队已从二十一大时的三万五千个增加到六万多个，有几十万人成了这一竞赛中的突击手。他们正在制订今年新的竞赛计划。
    目前，苏联各地已对四个月来的竞赛进行了初步总结，成千的工作队已经获得“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
    在发起这一竞赛的莫斯科——梁赞铁路线莫斯科调车站，已有二十一个工作队参加竞赛，有一个车间和两个机车组获得了“共产主义劳动队”的称号。
    这一竞赛和社会主义劳动竞赛不同，它不仅要求参加竞赛的人在生产上每月超额完成指标，多提合理化建议，而且要按照共产主义的要求生活和学习，要学习多种技能、遵守共产主义道德。因此，凡是展开这一竞赛的地方，工作、学习和生活都出现了新的面貌。
