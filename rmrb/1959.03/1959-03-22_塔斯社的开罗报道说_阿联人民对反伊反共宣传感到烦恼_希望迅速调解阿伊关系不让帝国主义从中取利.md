TASS Cairo Report:

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st. TASS Cairo, March 20th: The public and press in the United Arab Republic (UAR) are paying attention to Khrushchev's speech at the reception held in the Kremlin for the delegation of the Iraqi Republic's government.

The excessive haste shown by some people in commenting on the points of this speech has led some commentators, especially the Middle East News Agency's diplomatic commentator, to believe that this speech represents a "turning point" in relations between the Soviet Union and the UAR. They completely ignore the fact (as Khrushchev pointed out in his speech) that relations between the Soviet Union and the UAR will remain the same as in the past.

The people of the UAR have never believed, and do not believe now, that the Soviet Union might change its friendly attitude towards Arab countries. They also remember very clearly that it was the Soviet Union that helped Egypt, Syria, and Iraq defend their independence. They are annoyed by anti-Iraqi, anti-communist propaganda and urgently hope for a swift mediation of relations between the UAR and the Republic of Iraq.

Most observers believe that the issue of relations between the two Arab countries cannot be considered unrelated to recent events in the Near East.

People here note that the intensification of tensions between the UAR and the Republic of Iraq and the instigated anti-communist movement coincided with the United States concluding bilateral military agreements with the so-called Baghdad Pact countries bordering the Republic of Iraq and the UAR – Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran.

Diplomatic circles also point out that, as a result of the signing of the London Agreement, Cyprus continues to be maintained as a strategic base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Everyone knows that it was this base that the imperialist countries relied on last year to carry out their aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. Britain has strengthened its imperialist positions in the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula. The United States has consolidated its military bases in Libya, a neighboring country of the UAR.

In this way, a semi-circular encirclement of military bases of imperialist countries has been established around the Republic of Iraq and the UAR, which recently freed themselves from imperialist rule. These imperialist countries are using the exaggeration of artificial contradictions between Arab countries and the fabrication of the lie of the so-called "communist threat" to formulate long-term plans to restore colonial rule in Arab countries.

The task the imperialist countries have set for themselves is to divert the attention of Arab countries' leaders from foreign policy issues and force them to concentrate their forces on dealing with internal contradictions.

Observers point out that imperialist countries have, through clever tricks, already achieved their goals to some extent and exacerbated the contradictions between the two young Arab republics.

A commentary published by Schmidt, the Washington correspondent of the "New York Times" on March 12, is particularly illustrative of the attitude of Western countries towards the conflict between the UAR and the Republic of Iraq. Schmidt wrote, "The consequences of the already failed rebellion in Iraq may cause a crisis in the relationship between the UAR and the Soviet Union. This is the strategic benefit that the West can derive from the disastrous situation in the Near East."

People here also point out that Western imperialist propaganda has to some extent achieved the goal of undermining the policy of active neutrality, non-interference, and peaceful coexistence pursued by the UAR, based on the Bandung principles. Diplomatic circles point out that, in any case, the current position taken by the UAR press and officials towards the Republic of Iraq is far from consistent with the policy of active neutrality.

Although the press is continuing its propaganda campaign against Iraq and against communism, people here hope that reason will prevail and that efforts will be made to eliminate this conflict so as not to allow imperialism to exploit it for its own benefit.

    塔斯社的开罗报道说
    阿联人民对反伊反共宣传感到烦恼
    希望迅速调解阿伊关系不让帝国主义从中取利
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社开罗20日讯：阿拉伯联合共和国的公众和报刊注意赫鲁晓夫在克里姆林宫为伊拉克共和国政府代表团举行的招待会上的讲话。
    某些人士在评论这一讲话的论点时所表现出的过分匆忙的态度，使得某些评论员，特别是中东通讯社的外交评论员认为这一讲话是苏联和阿联之间关系的“转折点”。他们完全忽视了这样一个事实（正如赫鲁晓夫在讲话中所指出的那样）：苏联和阿联之间的关系将和过去一样。
    阿联人民过去和现在都不相信，苏联可能改变自己对阿拉伯国家的友好态度。他们还记得很清楚，正是苏联帮助了埃及、叙利亚和伊拉克保卫了它们的独立。他们对反伊反共的宣传感到烦恼，迫切期望迅速调解阿联和伊拉克共和国之间的关系。
    大多数观察家都认为，决不能认为两个阿拉伯国家之间的关系问题同近东地区最近的事件无关。
    这里的人们注意到，阿联和伊拉克共和国之间紧张关系的加剧和策动起来的反共运动，是和美国同那些与伊拉克共和国和阿联毗邻的所谓巴格达条约国家——巴基斯坦、土耳其和伊朗缔结双边军事协定同时发生的。
    外交界人士还指出，由于签订伦敦协定，塞浦路斯被继续保持为北大西洋公约组织的战略基地。大家都知道，去年帝国主义国家就是靠这个基地来实现对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略的。英国加强了它在阿拉伯半岛南部地区的帝国主义阵地。美国巩固了自己在阿联的邻国利比亚的军事基地。
    这样一来，在不久前摆脱了帝国主义统治的伊拉克共和国和阿联的周围建立了帝国主义国家军事基地的半圆形的包围圈。这些帝国主义国家利用渲染阿拉伯国家之间人为的矛盾和捏造所谓
  “共产主义威胁”的谎言来制订在阿拉伯国家恢复殖民统治的长远计划。
    帝国主义国家给自己提出的任务是：要转移阿拉伯国家的领导人对外交政策问题的注意，迫使他们集中自己的力量来对付内部的矛盾。
    观察家指出，帝国主义国家通过巧妙的花招已经在某种程度上达到了自己的目的和加剧了两个年轻的阿拉伯共和国之间的矛盾。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿特派记者施密特3月12日发表的评论特别能够说明西方国家对阿联和伊拉克共和国之间的冲突所抱的态度。施密特写道，“在伊拉克的已经失败的叛乱的后果可能引起阿联和苏联之间相互关系的危机。这就是西方可以从近东的灾难局面中所能得到的策略利益”。
    这里的人们还指出，西方帝国主义的宣传在某种程度上达到了破坏阿联所执行的、以万隆原则为基础的积极中立、不干涉和和平共处的政策的目的。外交界人士指出，无论如何，目前阿联报刊和官方人士对伊拉克共和国所采取的立场远不符合积极中立的政策。
    虽然报刊还在继续进行反对伊拉克、反对共产主义的宣传运动，但这里的人都希望，理智会占上风并竭力消除这一冲突，不让帝国主义有可能利用它来为自己的利益服务。
