    Teachers Teach with Heart, Students Learn with Heart
    Bai Sheng
    The China University of Science and Technology has correctly implemented the Party's educational policy, fully utilizing the leading role of teachers in teaching under the principle of teaching and learning from each other, and has grown rapidly. In this school, teachers teach with heart, students learn with heart, and the quality of teaching and learning is constantly improving, providing excellent experience for teaching work in higher education institutions.
    Why have they been able to achieve such good results in teaching in such a short period? The main reason is that the school's Party committee can effectively lead the teaching work, paying attention to strengthening the teaching of basic science theory courses for students, based on the characteristic that cultivating top-notch science and technology talents must first have a solid foundation of scientific theory and be able to master the latest scientific experimental techniques.
    In order to truly teach students basic scientific theoretical knowledge and strictly conduct operational training in experimental techniques, this school fully utilizes the initiative of teachers and students, allowing teachers and students to jointly conduct teaching and learning activities tailored to the characteristics of the teaching. This has truly made teachers teach with heart and students learn with heart in the school. For example, under the leadership of the Party organization, the entire school regularly holds teacher-student symposiums for each course, allowing teachers and students to freely discuss problems and opinions in the teaching and learning process to improve teaching work. Furthermore, teachers are organized to strengthen extracurricular tutoring for students, enabling teachers to go deep into the students to conduct actual teaching. In this way, teachers can gain an in-depth understanding of students' learning situations and needs, and students can actively tell teachers their learning thoughts, learning difficulties, and opinions on teaching, thereby deepening the relationship between teachers and students in teaching and learning. Furthermore, after learning that students' understanding of basic science theory courses was not deep or thorough, many teachers personally went to relevant production sites to collect materials in order to better help students understand some basic theorems in physics and chemistry in connection with production practice, and then gave lectures. Some teachers specially compiled lecture notes suitable for students' learning situations. This school has thus achieved teacher-student cooperation, teaching and learning from each other, fully utilizing the leading role of teachers in teaching work, and also giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of students. Therefore, teachers teach with heart and teach well; students learn with heart and learn well, greatly improving the quality of teaching.
    In teaching work, it is very important for teachers to teach with heart and teach well. To teach with heart and teach well, teachers must establish the view of education serving proletarian politics and the view of combining education with productive labor, and correctly implement the Party's educational policy, being both red and expert. For students, learning with heart is the main thing. If they do not learn with heart, even if the teacher teaches well, the best results cannot be obtained. Therefore, teachers teach with heart so that they can teach well, and students learn with heart so that they can learn well. With the joint efforts of teachers and students, the role of teaching and learning from each other can be brought into play, and the school's teaching work can be done better.

    教师用心教　学生用心学
    柏生
    中国科学技术大学正确地贯彻执行了党的教育工作方针，在教学相长的原则下充分发挥了教师在教学中的主导作用，已经迅速成长起来。这个学校教师用心教，学生用心学，教和学的质量不断在提高，为高等学校的教学工作提供了很好的经验。
    为什么他们在短短的时间中，能够在教学中取得如此好的成绩呢？主要是学校党委能够根据学校培养尖端科学技术人材，必须首先具有坚实的科学理论基础、能掌握最新科学实验技术这个特点，切实地把教学工作领导起来，注意了抓住加强学生的基础科学理论课程的教学这一环节。
    为了真正地教给学生以科学基础理论知识和严格地进行实验技术的操作训练，这个学校充分地发挥了师生的积极性，让师生共同针对教学特点进行教与学的活动。这就在学校中真正做到了教师用心教，学生用心学。例如，在党组织的领导下，全校定期召开各门课程的师生座谈会，使师生互相畅谈教与学过程中的问题和意见，改进教学工作。又如，组织教师加强对学生的课外辅导，使教师深入学生中去实际进行教学。这样，教师们既能深入了解学生学习的情况和需要，而学生也能把自己的学习思想和学习上的困难，以及对教学的意见主动告诉教师，从而加深了师生的教与学之间的关系。再如，许多教师在了解到学生对基础科学理论课学习理解得不深不透的情况后，为了更好地帮助学生结合生产实际理解物理和化学上的一些基本定理，就亲自到有关生产现场去搜集资料，然后再进行讲课。有的教师专门编写了适合学生学习情况的讲义。这个学校就是这样地实现了师生合作，教学相长，既充分发挥了教师在教学工作中的主导作用，也发挥了学生的主动性和积极性，因而教师用心教，教得好；学生用心学，学得也好，大大地提高了教学质量。
    在教学工作中，教师用心教，教得好，是非常重要的。要用心教，教得好，教师就要树立教育为无产阶级政治服务的观点，教育与生产劳动相结合的观点，正确贯彻执行党的教育工作方针，又红又专。对于学生来说，用心学是主要的，如果不用心学，教师虽然教得好，也是不能获得最好的效果的。因此，教师用心教，才能教得好，学生用心学，才能学得好。师生共同努力，就可以发挥教学相长的作用，把学校的教学工作作得更好。
