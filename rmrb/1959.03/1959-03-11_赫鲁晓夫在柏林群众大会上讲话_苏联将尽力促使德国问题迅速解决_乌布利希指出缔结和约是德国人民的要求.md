Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 9th: The working people of the capital of the German Democratic Republic held a mass rally today in the Weina-Seelenbinder Hall in democratic Berlin to welcome Soviet Premier Khrushchev's visit to Berlin. The hall was brightly lit, and both inside and outside the hall were crowded with residents from East and West Berlin.

This mass rally, attended by thousands of people, was convened by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in conjunction with the Greater Berlin District Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

When Khrushchev and GDR leaders Ulbricht, Grotewohl, Dieckmann, and others entered the hall, the entire audience stood up and greeted them with thunderous cheers.

The meeting was presided over by Correns, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany. Khrushchev and Ulbricht spoke at the meeting.

Khrushchev said that during his visits to Leipzig and Berlin, every German he had spoken to, without exception, hoped for peaceful coexistence among all peoples and for friendship with the Soviet Union. It seemed that they reflected the sentiments of the vast majority of Germans.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people consider the working people of the German Democratic Republic to be their close friends, their brothers fighting side by side for the great ideals of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. We are advancing towards communism shoulder to shoulder with you.

Khrushchev then spoke about the German question. He said that a peaceful resolution of the German question would be an important step in improving the international situation. This issue has matured. The German people and the people of the world are waiting for this issue to be resolved. Unfortunately, we do not see any desire on the part of the ruling groups in the Western countries to expedite the conclusion of a peace treaty and eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin. However, we still hope that our proposals will be duly understood by all countries, and we will not relax our efforts to ensure that these issues are resolved quickly.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has put forward a proposal to give West Berlin the status of a free city. Implementing this proposal would not bring any changes to the current situation in West Berlin, except to eliminate the occupation regime. Some people in the West are worried that the freedom and independence of West Berlin will be threatened by others. This worry is, of course, completely unfounded. Moreover, we have suggested that the major powers guarantee the independent and free development of the free city. We also have no objection to the United Nations participating in this guarantee. If necessary, we even agree to a solution where the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, or some neutral countries, can station a minimum number of troops in West Berlin to ensure that the status of the free city is respected, but they have no right to interfere in the internal life of the city.

Khrushchev pointed out that the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city has received widespread support. However, some people believe that perhaps not only West Berlin should be declared a free city, but also East Berlin. Obviously, these gentlemen have forgotten that Berlin is the capital of the German Democratic Republic. These people have a big appetite. We believe that this argument is untenable, unrealistic, and will only complicate the resolution of the issue of establishing a free city in West Berlin.

Khrushchev said that now some people are even threatening us, saying that if a peace treaty is concluded with the German Democratic Republic, then the Western countries will take countermeasures, even resorting to force.

Khrushchev emphasized that brandishing weapons will not scare us. We are not timid people, and we are prepared to give a proper rebuff to any attempt to use force against us or our friends. Do not forget that we also have such means, and the purpose of creating these means is to sober up those hotheads, so that they do not go crazy, dare not speak carelessly, and especially dare not act arbitrarily.

Khrushchev said that we hope that everyone clearly understands that we have put forward proposals on concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys and on eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin because we hope that the armed forces of the two camps will disengage and that the situation in this region will normalize. We will spare no effort and energy to eliminate the current dangerous situation in Germany. Even if the Western countries refuse to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys, we will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev then spoke about his exchange of views with the Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, on issues such as concluding a German peace treaty and eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin. He said, I hope that today's Social Democrats can deeply understand their responsibility to history and to their own working class, and strive to resolve issues that are of vital importance to the working class and to all the German people. There is no more important issue now than guaranteeing peace and creating conditions that exclude the possibility of a new war breaking out. Under the current conditions, everyone expects the German Social Democrats to have a clear understanding of the current situation. If they do not have a clear understanding of the current situation and do not do everything they should for the welfare of the people and for peace, then history will never forgive them.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that our generation bears the great historical task of leading mankind out of the dark and dead ends into which imperialism has led them into bloody wars. To show mankind the bright prospects of peaceful life. However, it is dangerous to underestimate the threat of war. The people of all countries should show high vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialist aggressive forces. We must not wait for peace, but defend peace in the struggle. Only through a tenacious struggle against the threat of war can lasting world peace be guaranteed.

Ulbricht then spoke. He said that Khrushchev's speech showed that the Soviet Union's peace proposals were fully in line with the traditions and goals of the National Front of Democratic Germany. He said that concluding a German peace treaty is the demand of the German people.

Ulbricht condemned Adenauer's desire to establish a "new order" in Europe with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to revive militarism, and to prepare for atomic war. He said that the Adenauer group opposes the peace treaty because they have no proposals of their own.

Ulbricht exposed the recent talks between Adenauer and de Gaulle. He said that Adenauer's aim is to use France as a major rear area and fallback base for German militarism. But the French people gave de Gaulle a heavy blow in the recent municipal elections. Ulbricht said that Adenauer's policies have reached a dead end. The people of West Germany are also increasingly aware of Adenauer's anti-national policies. He said that if Adenauer continues to be stubborn, then Khrushchev's recent speeches in Leipzig and Berlin will enlighten him.

In his speech, Ulbricht talked in detail about the significance of the Soviet proposals on West Berlin and the relationship between this proposal and the German peace treaty. He said that the Soviet draft peace treaty fully conforms to the peaceful aspirations of the German people and the people of other countries. If West Germany rejects the proposal to conclude a peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic will sign a peace treaty and hold high the banner of the struggle for peace and a German peace treaty for the entire German people.

In his speech, Ulbricht also talked about the West German Social Democratic Party. He condemned the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party for supporting Adenauer's policies, and condemned the destructive activities of the Social Democratic Party's Eastern Bureau. He said that the Social Democratic Party must abandon the "five-point program" that supports the West German army. At present, the West German working class is still divided. We must take united action and fight for the common cause of the German working class. Now it depends on the attitude of the Social Democratic Party.

In his speech, Ulbricht also called on the American people to support the German people's struggle to achieve a peace treaty.

Khrushchev's and Ulbricht's speeches were constantly interrupted by applause and cheers from the audience. At the end of the speeches, the crowd sang "The Internationale."

Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Germany were also invited to attend the mass rally.

    赫鲁晓夫在柏林群众大会上讲话
    苏联将尽力促使德国问题迅速解决
    乌布利希指出缔结和约是德国人民的要求
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国首都劳动人民今天在民主柏林的魏纳·西兰宾德大厅举行群众大会，欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问柏林。大厅里灯火辉煌，厅内外挤满了来自东西柏林的居民。
    这个有数千人参加的群众大会是由德国统一社会党中央委员会会同统一社会党大柏林专区委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会召集的。
      当赫鲁晓夫和德意志民主共和国领导人乌布利希、格罗提渥、狄克曼等人走进大厅的时候，全场起立，报以暴风雨般的欢呼声。
    大会由民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯主持。赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希先后在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在他访问来比锡和柏林期间，凡是同他谈过话的德国人，无例外地都希望各国人民之间和平相处，希望同苏联友好。看来，他们反映了绝大多数德国人的情绪。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民认为，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民是自己亲密的朋友，是自己的为马克思、恩格斯、列宁的伟大理想而共同斗争的兄弟。我们同你们在肩并肩地向共产主义前进。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了德国问题。他说，和平解决德国问题将是改善国际局势的一个重要步骤。这个问题已经成熟了。德国人民和全世界人民都期待着这个问题的解决。遗憾的是，我们看不到西方国家统治集团有促使尽快缔结和约和消除西柏林占领制度的愿望。但是，我们仍然希望，我们的建议会得到各国应有的理解，我们将不放松自己的努力，以便使这些问题迅速解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联提出了给西柏林以自由城市地位的建议。实现这个建议并不会给西柏林目前的状况带来任何改变，只不过是消除占领制度罢了。西方有人担心西柏林的自由和独立会受到别人的威胁。这种担心当然是毫无根据的。而且，我们已建议由大国来保证自由城市独立和自由地发展。我们也不反对联合国参加这种保证。如果需要的话，我们甚至同意这样的办法：美、英、法三国和苏联或一些中立国家可以在西柏林驻扎某种最低数目的军队，以保证自由城市的地位得到遵守，但它们无权干涉城市的内部生活。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，把西柏林变成非军事化自由城市的建议得到了广泛的支持。但是，也有人认为，也许宣布为自由城市的不仅应该是西柏林，而且也应该有东柏林。显然，这些先生们忘记了柏林是德意志民主共和国的首都。这些人的胃口是很大的。我们认为，这种论调是经不起一驳的，是不现实的，而且只会使解决在柏林西部建立自由城市的问题变得更加复杂起来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在甚至有人想威胁我们，他们说，如果同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，那么西方国家就要采取对策，甚至不惜动用武力。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，挥动武器是吓不倒我们的。我们不是胆小怕事的人，我们准备给企图对我们或我们的朋友使用武力的任何尝试以应有的回击。不要忘记我们也有这种手段，制造这种手段的目的就是为了使那些头脑发热的人清醒过来，使他们不致于发狂，不敢信口开河，特别是不敢为所欲为。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们希望所有的人都明确地理解到，我们之所以提出关于同两个德国缔结和约、关于消除西柏林占领制度的建议，是因为我们希望两个阵营的武装部队脱离接触，希望这个地区的局势正常化。我们将不惜力量和精力来消除德国目前的危险局势。即使西方国家拒绝同两个德国缔结和约，我们也要同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到，他和西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔就缔结对德和约、消除西柏林占领制度等问题交换了意见。他说，我希望今天的社会民主党人能深刻理解到自己对历史、对本国工人阶级的责任，并努力来解决对工人阶级、对全体德国人民有切身重大意义的问题。现在没有比保障和平，创造排除爆发新战争的可能性的条件更加重要的问题了。在当前条件下，大家期待德国社会民主党人清醒地理解目前的局势。如果他们不清醒地理解目前的局势，不对人民的福利、对和平作出他们应做的一切，那么历史就将永远不会饶恕他们。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们这一代肩负着伟大的历史任务——要把人类从帝国主义将他们引入流血战争的黑暗的死胡同里引出来。在人类的面前展现出和平生活的光明前景。但是，低估战争的威胁是一件危险的事。各国人民应当对帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋表现出高度的警惕。不能等待和平，而要在斗争中捍卫和平。只有对战争威胁进行顽强的斗争，才能保障世界的持久和平。
    乌布利希接着讲了话。他说，赫鲁晓夫的讲话表明，苏联的和平建议是同民主德国全国阵线的传统和目的完全一致的。他说，缔结对德和约是德国人民的要求。
    乌布利希谴责阿登纳想和北大西洋公约集团在欧洲建立“新秩序”，复活军国主义，准备原子战争。他说，阿登纳集团反对和约，因为他们没有自己的建议。
    乌布利希揭露了最近阿登纳和戴高乐举行的会谈。他说，阿登纳的目的是想把法国作为德国军国主义的大后方和退守基地。而法国人民却在最近的市政选举中给戴高乐一次沉重的打击。乌布利希说，阿登纳的政策已经进入了死胡同。西德人民也越来越多地认识到阿登纳的反民族政策。他说，如果阿登纳继续顽固不化，那么赫鲁晓夫最近在来比锡和柏林的一些讲话正好开导他。
    乌布利希在讲话中详细地谈到了苏联关于西柏林的建议的意义和这个建议同对德和约的关系。他说，苏联提出的对德和约草案完全符合德国人民和其他国家人民的和平愿望。如果西德拒绝缔结和约的建议，德意志民主共和国将签订和约，为全德国人民高举起争取和平和对德和约的斗争大旗。
    乌布利希在讲话中还谈到了西德社会民主党。他谴责社会民主党右翼领导支持阿登纳的政策，谴责社会民主党东方局进行的破坏活动。他说，社会民主党必须抛弃支持西德军队的“五点纲领”。目前西德工人阶级还处于分裂状态，我们要统一行动，要为德国工人阶级的共同事业而斗争，现在就看社会民主党的态度了。
    乌布利希在讲话中还呼吁美国人民支持德国人民争取实现和约的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希的讲话不断为到会群众的掌声和欢呼声所打断。讲话结束时，群众高唱“国际歌”。
    各国驻德外交使节也应邀参加了群众大会。
