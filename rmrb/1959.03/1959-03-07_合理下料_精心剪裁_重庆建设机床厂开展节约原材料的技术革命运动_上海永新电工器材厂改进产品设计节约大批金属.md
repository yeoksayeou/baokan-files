This newspaper, Chongqing, 6th: Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory workers are carrying out a technical revolution movement centered on increasing "output per unit area" and saving raw materials. Many units have seen a new situation of high yield and bumper harvest.

This year's production task of the factory is two-thirds more than last year. In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the task, from the end of January, the workers launched a technical revolution movement centered on increasing "output per unit area" and saving raw materials.

In more than a month, the factory workers put forward tens of thousands of technical innovation proposals, vigorously reformed the operating techniques of various processes, reformed machines, tools and other equipment and process regulations, so that many workshops, work areas and groups greatly increased the "output per unit area". There are already more than ten units in the factory with significantly higher output. In the first twenty days of February, the 22nd workshop carried out more than 1,600 innovations in technology and equipment, which quickly increased the daily output of products from more than 1,500 pieces in January to more than 2,800 pieces, creating the highest level of daily output in the workshop.

In the technical revolution movement, the factory workers also created and promoted various new technologies and methods for saving raw materials. The workers of the 21st workshop are vigorously experimenting with a new technology - changing all the machine parts of the factory from forging to precision casting. Machine parts made by forging have large machining allowances during processing. Using precision casting, the shape of the part is made during casting, so the machining allowance is small, which can greatly reduce the material quota. After the two precision-cast parts that have been successfully trial-produced in this workshop are put into production instead of forgings, the factory can save more than 150 tons of steel this year. Since the workers of the 35th workshop launched the "clever tailor" activity and implemented other methods of saving raw materials this year, they have saved more than 100 tons of metal materials in just one and a half months. In carrying out the "clever tailor" activity, the workers tried to arrange the templates reasonably when cutting and cutting materials, cut more regular materials, and reduce edge materials and residual materials. At the same time, without affecting the quality, the workers used the method of tailoring and mending clothes to weld small materials, edge materials, and residual materials together for use as whole materials and large materials. Many workers also reasonably simplified the product structure and reduced the consumption of raw materials on the premise of ensuring the performance of the machine. In the first quarter, the 35th workshop had to produce more than 200 large and small hoists. After repeated experiments and research, the workers reduced the number of parts for the hoist from 200 to 118, so that each large hoist reduced about one ton of steel.

This newspaper reports that the workers of Shanghai Yongxin Electrical Equipment Factory actively used substitutes and improved product design on the premise of not affecting product quality, and saved a lot of raw materials supply. In just over a month this year, the factory workers improved the design of four products, and according to the annual output, they can save the country 891 tons of ferrous metals.

This year, the factory needs more than 1,400 tons of ferrous metals to produce only one type of less oil switch. How to save steel is an important key to completing this year's leap forward task. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the staff of the production technology section closely combined with the workers to improve the design of the product and made a new type of oil switch. Calculated on the basis of an annual output of 7,000 units, it can save the country 710 tons of ferrous metals, 17.5 tons of calcium carbide, and 700 bottles of oxygen within a year, and also greatly compress the man-hours. At present, this product has begun small-scale production. After tasting the sweetness of improving product design, the engineering and technical personnel became more enthusiastic, and immediately improved the design of a switch box, and used this switch box to trial-produce a new type of switch table, which can also save the country 156 tons of steel within a year. Technician Ning Chao improved the design of the reactor on the premise of not affecting product quality, and successfully replaced silicon steel sheets with pig iron, which can save 290 kilograms of silicon steel sheets per reactor.

The workers also paid great attention to the rational use of raw materials. When the 406 group of the fourth workshop produced 2,000 current transformers, the supply of silicon steel sheets could not keep up for a while. They used the waste materials, edge materials, corner materials, and small materials that had been shelved in the workshop for many years to ensure the completion of the production task.

This newspaper reports that the workers of various factories in Siping City adopted various methods to save raw materials.

Under the guidance of the idea of ​​making the best use of big materials, making small use of small materials, not using good materials for inferior use, and fully substituting materials, the workers in the forging and riveting workshop of the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory adopted the blanking method of "big sets small, small sets", and saved more than 12,000 kilograms of various good steels in one month. In the past, the Jin Yuzhu group used good iron plates to make wool washer parts. The workers felt that it was a pity to use good materials to make such small parts, so they collected waste materials (material heads, material feet, material edges) instead of good iron plates to make 100,000 wool washer parts, saving more than 4,000 kilograms of good iron plates. The Zhang Huaji group made full use of waste materials to ensure that six types of parts did not need to be obtained from raw materials. At the beginning of the year, the task of the casting workshop was very tight, and there was insufficient pig iron. The workers collected waste iron and broken sand boxes and used them to ensure the completion of a batch of casting tasks. The Power Machinery Factory, Machine Tool Factory and other units have recently successfully trial-produced ductile iron, and replacing forging with casting can save a lot of steel.

    上海永新电工器材厂改进产品设计节约大批金属
    本报重庆6日电　重庆建设机床厂职工围绕提高“单位面积产量”和节约原材料，开展技术革命运动，许多单位已出现高产丰收的新局面。
    这个厂今年的生产任务要比去年增加三分之二；为了确保全面完成任务，从1月下旬起，职工便展开了以提高“单位面积产量”、节约原材料为中心的技术革命运动。
    一个多月来，全厂职工提出了几万件技术革新建议，大力革新了各工序的操作技术，改革了机器、工具等设备和工艺规程，使许多车间、工区和小组大大提高了“单位面积产量”。全厂显著高产的单位已有十多个。二十二车间由于在2月份前二十天中就在技术、设备方面进行了一千六百多项革新，使全车间产品的日产量由1月份的一千五百多件很快提高到二千八百多件，创造了车间日产量的最高水平。
    全厂职工在技术革命运动中，还创造和推行了各种节约原材料的新技术和新方法。二十一车间职工正在大力试验一种新技术——把全厂的机器零件由锻造改为精密铸造。用锻造方法制出的机器零件，在加工过程中加工余量大。改用精密铸造，在铸造时就制成了零件形状，因而加工余量少，可以大大降低材料定额。这个车间已经试制成功的两种精密铸造零件代替锻件投入生产以后，全厂今年就可以节约钢材一百五十多吨。三十五车间职工在今年开展“巧裁缝”活动和实行其他节约原材料的办法以来，仅一个半月的时间，便节约了金属材料一百多吨。在开展“巧裁缝”活动中，工人们下料剪料时尽量做到合理安排样板，多下正料，减少边料、余料。同时，在不影响质量的情况下，工人们用裁缝补衣的办法，把小料、边料、余料焊接起来，当整料、大料使用。许多职工还在确保机器性能的前提下，合理简化产品结构，减少原材料的消耗。三十五车间第一季度要生产大小卷扬机两百多台，职工经过多次试验研究，将卷扬机的零件种类由两百种减为一百一十八种，使每部大卷扬机减少了约一吨钢材。
    本报讯　上海永新电工器材厂的职工在不影响产品质量的前提下，积极采用代用品，改进产品设计，大量节约原材料供应。全厂职工仅在今年一个多月内就改进了四项产品的设计，按年产量计算，可为国家节约八百九十一吨黑色金属。
    今年，这个厂仅生产的一种少油开关就需要黑色金属一千四百多吨。怎样节约钢材，是完成今年跃进任务的重要关键。生产技术科的工作人员，在党的正确领导下，与工人紧密结合，改进了产品的设计，制成了一台新型的油开关。按年产量七千台计算，年内就可为国家节约黑色金属七百一十吨，节约电石十七吨半，氧气七百瓶，而且还大大压缩了工时。目前，这项产品已开始小批生产。工程技术人员在尝到改进产品设计的甜头后，劲头更大，紧接着又改进了一种开关箱的设计，并用这种开关箱试制成一台新型开关台，年内也能为国家节约一百五十六吨钢材。技术员宁超在不影响产品质量的前提下，改进了电抗器的设计，以生铁代替矽钢片成功，每台电抗器就能节省二百九十公斤矽钢片。
    工人们对合理使用原材料也很注意。第四车间四○六小组在生产二千只电流互感器时，矽钢片一时供应不上，他们就把搁置在车间多年不用的废料、边料、角料、小料加以利用，保证了生产任务的完成。
    本报讯　四平市各工厂职工采用各种办法节约原材料。
    省农业机械厂在大材大用，小材小用，优材不劣用，充分代用，使物尽其用的思想指导下，锻铆车间工人采取“大套小、小套了”的下料方法，在一个月时间内就节约各种好钢材一万二千多公斤。金玉珠小组过去做毛垫圈部件都使用好铁板，工人们感到做这种小部件用好料很可惜，就搜集废料（料头、料脚、料边）代替好铁板做成十万个毛垫圈部件，节约好铁板四千多公斤。张化吉小组充分利用废料，做到六种部件不领原材料。铸造车间年初任务很紧，生铁不足，工人们把废铁、破砂箱都搜集起来加以利用，保证了一批铸造任务的完成。动力机械厂、机床厂等单位，最近都试制成功了球墨铸铁，以铸代锻可以节约大量钢材。
