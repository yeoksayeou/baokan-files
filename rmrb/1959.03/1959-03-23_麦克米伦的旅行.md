    Macmillan's Trip
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

    After visiting Moscow, British Prime Minister Macmillan went to Paris and Bonn successively. Now, he has arrived in Washington to hold talks with Eisenhower.

    In just one month, Macmillan has traveled almost around the globe, making himself a very active figure in Western countries.

    Starting from Moscow and ending in Washington—this carefully arranged journey itself has a certain significance.

    Macmillan summarized the purpose of his visit to the Soviet Union as: merely "probing," not "negotiating." In other words, he was only there to explore the Soviet Union's views and attitudes on some major international issues—especially the German and Berlin issues—so that Western countries could formulate their common policies.

    In fact, the Soviet Union's position and policy on the German and Berlin issues have always been very clear and explicit, and have long been known to Western countries.

    Since Macmillan limited the purpose of his visit to the Soviet Union to the scope of "probing," the role of this visit could not but be greatly reduced. For example, Macmillan did not accept the Soviet proposal to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries, even though he had advocated such a treaty not long ago. Macmillan also did not have the determination to try to resolve some of the major international issues of the moment.

    But despite this, Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union still has its positive significance. The Anglo-Soviet communiqué affirmed that international disputes should be resolved through peaceful consultation, not through war. At that time, some leaders in the United States were carrying out blackmail and intimidation, threatening to use nuclear weapons on the Berlin issue. The British and Soviet sides also expressed the hope to stop nuclear weapon testing as soon as possible. The communiqué also mentioned that the two sides discussed the possibility of limiting troops and armaments in certain regions of Europe.

    The idea of establishing a security zone in Central Europe, proposed by Eden in 1955 and later specified by Poland's Rapacki Plan, was discussed at the level of heads of government for the first time.

    In addition, after Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, there was new progress in trade relations and cultural exchanges between Britain and the Soviet Union.

    All of this has had a beneficial impact on the development of the international situation. And for Britain itself, as a result of Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, and because it has carried out independent diplomatic activities to a greater or lesser extent, Britain's position in the Western camp has changed.

    As a logical result of the visit to the Soviet Union, Macmillan held talks with de Gaulle and Adenauer respectively. Britain explained the necessity of holding these talks: Macmillan told its Western European "allies" the results of his visit to the Soviet Union and discussed countermeasures, and, under the current circumstances, neither de Gaulle nor Adenauer could or should go to the Soviet Union.

    Although Britain cannot be said to be worth a hundred times its value, its position in the Western camp has clearly improved a lot. Before this, since the failure of the free trade area plan, Britain had been in a very isolated situation in Western Europe.

    Currently, the relationship between Britain and West Germany and the United States is very delicate.

    Adenauer hoped that Macmillan would clarify Britain's attitude on the issue of a European security zone, and worried that Britain would take further action in this regard. Adenauer tried his best to oppose the establishment of such a security zone plan, whether the troops in this zone were completely withdrawn, reduced, or frozen at the current level. Because the realization of such a plan would interrupt West Germany's rearmament process, hinder West Germany from obtaining nuclear weapons, and create a favorable atmosphere for the solution of the German issue.

    In the past negotiations on the free trade area plan, West Germany played a pivotal role in the dispute between Britain and France. Now, the situation is beginning to change: Britain is trying to get rid of its old passive position and is trying to lower West Germany's prestige by all means.

    When dealing with the United States, Britain's voice is louder and its spirit is stronger than in the past. Britain has publicly criticized some of the measures taken by the United States in trade. Macmillan also pounded his chest in Parliament and guaranteed that when he arrived in Washington, he would protest to the United States and ask Eisenhower to "pay attention to the strong opposition in this country."

    It is worth noting that not long ago, some British newspapers closely related to the Conservative Party and the British government uniformly publicized that Macmillan had become the number one figure in the Western camp. They said: Dulles has fallen ill, de Gaulle is preoccupied with his own affairs, and Adenauer is old and frail; the role Macmillan is now playing cannot be replaced by anyone.

    The ongoing Anglo-American talks began against the above background.

    Macmillan's first speech after arriving in Washington directly mentioned the issue of Anglo-American relations. He said:

  "When we face some serious and urgent problems, mutual dependence is more necessary than ever today." Macmillan further explained: The main factor or cornerstone of mutual dependence "is the Anglo-American partnership."

    The term "mutual dependence," a term in Western politics, has disappeared for a year. Now, Macmillan has reaffirmed it and given it a new meaning.

    Eisenhower certainly did not remain silent. As early as three days before Macmillan arrived in the United States, Eisenhower said in a radio speech: "We cannot accept any agreement or arrangement that would undermine the security of the United States and its allies simply to show so-called 'flexibility.'"

    It is Macmillan who has recently been constantly emphasizing that Western countries must have "flexibility" in tactics.

    Whenever the United States fights back to defend its "leadership position," Britain often retreats a little. For example, Eisenhower personally came forward to refute the remarks in British newspapers that Macmillan was being touted as the "number one figure." Eisenhower said that the position of the United States has not changed, and it is still the "leading force" in the Western camp. Immediately afterwards, "The Times" published an editorial, renaming Macmillan as a "middleman"—he is not playing a leading role, but only a role of "communication."

    The events of the past month show that Britain has taken some diplomatic initiatives on individual issues (such as visiting the Soviet Union); but at the same time, it should be seen that this does not at all mean that there has been any major shift in Britain's foreign policy. In fact, Macmillan himself made it very clear: Britain's position on the German and Berlin issues is the same as that of the United States, the only difference is tactics. He also wants to change the unfavorable position of Western countries on the German and Berlin issues.

    If we note that Britain today still has to rely on American loans to survive, and still has to seek American "cooperation" in suppressing national liberation movements, we can know that Britain cannot break away from the United States.

    But the important fact is that the United States is in a very isolated and extremely passive situation on the German and Berlin issues, and its position in the Western camp has been greatly weakened; on the other hand, West Germany and France have formed an alliance and are excluding Britain from Western European affairs. This makes it inevitable that Britain will, and will continue to, seize every opportunity to strike at its competitors and strive to improve its position.

    麦克米伦的旅行
    本报记者　潘非
    在访问了莫斯科之后，英国首相麦克米伦曾先后前往巴黎和波恩。现在，他又到了华盛顿，同艾森豪威尔举行会谈。
    在短短的一个月内，麦克米伦几乎绕了地球一圈，使自己成为西方国家中一个十分活跃的人物。
    以莫斯科为起点，以华盛顿为终点——这一精心安排的旅程，本身就具有一定的意义。
    麦克米伦把他访问苏联的目的，概括为：只是“探测”，并非“谈判”。换句话说，他只是去探听苏联对一些重大的国际问题——特别是德国和柏林问题的观点和态度，以便西方国家有可能制定出它们的共同政策。
    事实上，苏联在德国和柏林问题上的立场和政策，一向十分清楚和明朗，早已为西方国家所共知。
    麦克米伦既然把他的访苏目的局限于“探测”的范围之内，就不能不使这次访问的作用大大降低。例如，麦克米伦没有接受苏联提出的缔结两国互不侵犯条约的建议，而缔结这样一个条约，正是他不久以前所主张过的。对于当前一些重大的国际问题，麦克米伦也没有决心去试图解决。
    但是尽管这样，麦克米伦访问苏联仍然有其积极意义。英苏会谈公报，肯定了以和平协商的方法，而不是以战争的方法，来解决国际争端。正在那个时候，美国的一些领导人则进行着讹诈与恫吓，扬言要在柏林问题上使用核武器。英苏双方并表示希望从速停止核武器试验。公报还提到，双方讨论了关于在欧洲一定地区限制部队和军备的可能性问题。
    1955年由艾登提出、后来由波兰的腊帕茨基计划具体化了的在中欧建立安全区的思想，第一次在政府首脑一级的水平上进行了讨论。
    此外，在麦克米伦访苏以后，英苏之间的贸易关系和文化往来，有了新的进展。
    所有这些，对于国际局势的发展，起了有益的影响。而对于英国本身来说，由于麦克米伦访苏的结果，由于它多多少少进行了独立的外交活动，使得英国在西方阵营中的地位有了改变。
    作为访问苏联的逻辑结果，是麦克米伦同戴高乐和阿登纳分别举行会谈。英国解释举行这些会谈的必要性：麦克米伦把访苏的结果告诉它的西欧“盟国”，并商订对策，而且，不论戴高乐也好，阿登纳也好，在目前情况下，他们都不可能或者不宜于前往苏联。
    英国虽然还谈不上身价百倍，但是，他在西方阵营中的地位显然已提高不少。而在此以前，即自从自由贸易区计划失败以来，英国在西欧已陷于十分孤立。
    目前英国同西德和美国的关系是很微妙的。
    阿登纳希望麦克米伦澄清英国在欧洲安全区问题上的态度，并担心英国在这方面采取进一步的行动。阿登纳竭力反对建立这样一个安全区的计划，不论这个区域内的部队全部撤出也好，减少也好，或者冻结在现有水平上也好。因为这样一个计划的实现，将打断西德重新武装的进程，阻挠西德获得核武器，并且为德国问题的解决创造了有利的气氛。
    在过去谈判自由贸易区计划时，西德在英法的争执中扮演了一个举足轻重的角色。现在，情况正在开始改变：英国竭力摆脱旧日的被动地位，并想尽办法来压低西德的气陷。
    在同美国打交道时，英国的嗓门比过去高了一些，气也壮了一些。英国对美国在贸易上所采取的某些措施，进行了公开的抨击。麦克米伦并在议会中拍胸脯保证：当他到达华盛顿后，一定向美国抗议，要艾森豪威尔“注意这个国家中强烈的反对情绪。”
    值得注意的是，在不久以前，同保守党和英国官方有密切联系的一些英国报纸，一致宣传麦克米伦已成为西方阵营中的第一号人物。它们说：杜勒斯已经病倒，戴高乐自顾不暇，阿登纳老朽不堪；麦克米伦现在所起的作用，是谁也代替不了的。
    目前正在进行中的英美会谈，就是在上述的背景下开始的。
    麦克米伦到达华盛顿后的第一次发言，就直截了当地提到了英美关系问题。他说：
  “当我们面临着一些严重的和紧急的问题时，互相依赖没有比今天更为必要了。”麦克米伦进一步解释：互相依赖的主要因素或基石，“是英美的合伙关系”。
    “互相依赖”这一西方政治中的术语，一年来早已消声匿迹。现在，麦克米伦又加以重申，并赋予它新的涵义。
    艾森豪威尔当然并没有沉默。早在麦克米伦到达美国的前三天，艾森豪威尔在一次广播演说中说道：“我们不能够仅仅为了表示所谓的‘灵活性’，而接受会破坏美国及其盟国的安全的任何协定或安排。”
    大家知道，正是麦克米伦，最近不断地强调西方国家在策略上必须有“灵活性”。
    每当美国为了捍卫自己的“领导地位”而进行反击的时候，英国往往向后退缩一下。例如，艾森豪威尔曾亲自出马，反驳英国报纸把麦克米伦捧为“第一号人物”的言论。艾森豪威尔说，美国的地位并没有改变，它仍然是西方阵营中的“领导力量”。紧接着，“泰晤士报”就发表社论，把麦克米伦改称为“中间人”——他起的不是领导作用，只是“通”的作用。
    一个月来的事态表明：英国曾在个别问题上采取了一些外交上的主动（如访问苏联）；但同时更应看到，这根本谈不上英国在对外政策上有什么重大的转变。事实上，麦克米伦自己就说得很清楚：英国在德国和柏林问题上的立场，同美国是一致的，所不同的只是策略。他也想改变西方国家在德国和柏林问题上所处的不利地位。
    如果注意到英国今天还不能不依靠美国的贷款过日子，还不能不在镇压民族解放运动中寻求美国的“合作”，就可以知道，英国还不可能同美国分道扬镳。
    但是，重要的事实是：美国在德国和柏林问题上已处于十分孤立和极为被动的境地，它在西方阵营中的地位已大大削弱；而另一方面，西德和法国已结成联盟，正在把英国排斥于西欧事务之外。这就使得英国必然会、并且将继续会利用一切机会，来打击竞争中的对手，竭力提高自己的地位。
