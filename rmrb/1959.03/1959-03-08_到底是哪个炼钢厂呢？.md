    Which Steel Plant Is It?
    The communication "The Bell for Tapping Steel Sounds," published on the second page of the March 3rd issue, depicts the images of a group of heroes fighting for steel. From leading cadres to the masses of workers, everyone is full of energy and heroic spirit. The cooperation between departments is so close that they are determined to achieve "four happy events at the same time." All of this is so moving! I want to pay tribute to these steel heroes!
    However, which steel plant is this about? The author forgot to mention it. It is truly regrettable, and I want to write a letter to the heroes, but I have nowhere to send it.　　　　　　　　Xiao Yu
      Editor's Note: This is about the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. It was our oversight not to specify the name of the plant.

    到底是哪个炼钢厂呢？
    3月3日第二版上登的“出钢的钟声响了”的通讯，写出了一群为钢而战的英雄们的形象，从领导干部到工人群众，个个干劲十足，人人英雄气概；部门之间协作得那么紧密，非让“四喜临门”不可。这一切多么使人感动！我要向这些钢铁英雄们致敬！
    但是，这到底是哪个炼钢厂的事呢？作者却忘了交代。真使人遗憾，想给英雄们写封信，也无处投递了。　　　　　　　　肖煜
      编者按：这是鞍山钢铁公司的事情。没有写明厂名，是我们的疏忽。
