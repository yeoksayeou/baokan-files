Kundulun’s Girls
By Our Correspondent Cheng Jingming

Position

Kundulun—the new urban district of Baotou Steel City, a brand-new city built from wasteland. The streets are smooth and wide, crisscrossing each other. The main street of the new urban district has a resounding name—Iron and Steel Avenue. This fourteen-li-long road stretches straight from east to west, crossing the Kundu River and leading to the magnificent Baotou Steel plant area...

Like everyone who comes here for the first time, we were drawn to an unexpected sight: at the intersection of the busiest Iron and Steel Avenue and Baiyun Ebo Road, a female police officer stood at the traffic police post. A fur hat pressed down on her short hair, a blue uniform, snow-white cuffs, a belt tightly fastened around her waist, and a pair of half-high leather boots on her feet—she looked truly heroic. She stood tall, skillfully waving the baton in her hand.

On Youth Road, Friendship Road, Forward Road, and Linyin West Road, there are such female police officers patrolling. They occasionally raise their loudspeakers, cordially advising those who do not obey traffic rules: "Pedestrians, please use the sidewalk!"

The growth of female police officers reflects the leap forward in the construction of Baotou Steel from one aspect. The construction site requires a large amount of strong labor, and women have become a vital force in various service industries in Kundulun. The traffic and fire police brigade also began to train female police officers. The first group of seventeen proudly took on the task of directing traffic.

The next morning, I pushed open the window facing the street. In the moonlight, the road was a dark, dense mass. The crowd, like a constantly flowing river, surged towards the factory buildings. Under the window, the familiar loudspeaker sounded again: "Comrades, please watch out for vehicles, please watch out for vehicles!" The female police officers guarded the post, attentively watching the pedestrians, sending them to the construction site batch by batch; when it was dark, they welcomed them home from work under the lights, diligently maintaining the traffic safety of the Baotou Steel builders.

Test

Every day, every hour, how many vehicles and pedestrians pass before them? I obtained an outdated statistical table. It recorded the hourly traffic flow on Iron and Steel Avenue as: one hundred and ninety-seven cars, three thousand two hundred and twenty-five bicycles, one thousand and ninety-four horse-drawn carts, ox carts, and thirteen thousand two hundred and twenty-five pedestrians. Such a number may not be significant in a large city, but it is noteworthy in Baotou. At the time of liberation, the entire city of Baotou had only nine dilapidated cars.

Standing at the crossroads of traffic arteries, directing so many vehicles, horses, and pedestrians to pass safely and orderly, is not an easy task for these former rural girls and female students. They only received twenty days of training before going into action "replacing men with women." At first, they could cope when there were few cars and people; but when many vehicles came from all directions at the same time, they couldn't help but panic, sweating profusely. However, with their attention to detail and courage, they became calm and skilled after a period of time. From National Day in 1958—the first working day for female police officers—until now, no traffic accidents causing injury or death have occurred in the sections they are responsible for.

In the dead of winter, the cold wind howls outside the Great Wall, and the cold is biting. If you stay outdoors for a while, your eyebrows and eyelashes will be covered with white, crystalline ice flowers. But the female police officers stood upright at their posts, braving the biting cold wind to perform their duties. Sometimes, their hands ached as if pricked by needles, and their heels cracked from the cold. After standing for two hours, their bodies were almost numb. However, no one ever complained; they were all early for duty and late to leave. Several times, passing elderly people stopped and kindly greeted them: "Girls, come down and warm yourselves!" The female police officers smiled gratefully and shook their heads.

Once, because the weather was very cold, nineteen-year-old Xiao Wang quietly collapsed on her bed after going off duty and covered her head with a quilt and cried. She thought of her mother far away in Qingdao, of the good weather in her hometown, and regretted running to this place to suffer. After crying for a while, she thought, that's not right! In such an important position, holding the safety of so many pedestrians, vehicles, and horses in her hands every day, if I don't want to do it, who will? It is such a shameful idea to be afraid of difficulties and seek ease. Without today's hard work, when will Baotou Steel be built? What does the cold weather matter? There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of a Communist Youth League member. After thinking about it repeatedly, Xiao Wang felt as if she had seen the sun after the clouds cleared. Her mood suddenly brightened, and she was as happy as before. When she talked to me about this past event, she shook her head childishly and said repeatedly: "That kind of thinking was too dangerous, too dangerous!"

What a good girl, after overcoming a wavering, she became even stronger and has now become an advanced worker among the female police officers.

"Good girl, leave your name"

Trains are constantly sending large numbers of passengers to Baotou. There are workers and experts supporting Baotou Steel, citizens who have come to settle in the new steel city, and commune members from nearby counties coming to visit relatives. Many people come to the female police officers' posts every day to ask for directions. There are too many new neighborhoods and new houses, and sometimes it is difficult to explain clearly all at once. "New buildings are popping up every day, and you don't know when another road will come out." It is not an exaggeration for the female police officers to describe the changes in Kundulun in this way. A few years ago, this was still a wilderness, with only a few scattered small villages, totaling only two hundred households. In April 1955, the first brick house appeared in Kundulun. From that time on, more and more people came from all over the country to build Baotou Steel, ten thousand, thirty thousand, fifty thousand...now the population is nearly two hundred thousand. The female police officers are full of enthusiasm for every working person who comes to Kundulun and are happy to serve them.

One afternoon at the end of October last year, Wang Cuiyu finished her patrol and was riding her bicycle home. When she reached Wula Road, she saw an old farmer sitting at the corner of a wall in a daze, with a package beside him. "He must be lost," Wang Cuiyu guessed, and immediately got off her bike: "Grandpa, are you looking for someone?" The old man nodded and took out a crumpled envelope with his son's address on it. After Wang Cuiyu read the envelope, she told him in detail which direction to go and what landmarks were at the turning point. After hearing this, the old man looked bewildered. What to do? Wang Cuiyu had just come from that direction, traveling a long distance. However, she forgot her fatigue and immediately took the package, put it on her bike and pushed it, leading the old man all the way to the southern section of Baiyun Road, asking door to door, and finally found his son's dormitory. The old man's daughter-in-law chased after her to thank her repeatedly, and Wang Cuiyu smiled and said "Goodbye" and rode away.

Helping the old and the young, leading guests from afar to find organizations and people, has almost become an important activity for female police officers after they get off work. Each of them encounters this kind of thing every two or three days. Li Shuzhai and Li Ping once helped an old woman and walked for two whole hours, sending the old woman home. The old woman held their hands tightly and said earnestly: "Good girls, leave your names so I can remember you."

These police officers who are called "good girls" are truly a group of amiable aunts and older sisters to the lost children in the Kundulun District. When they are patrolling the streets and publicizing traffic rules in public places, they immediately take or hold the lost children and try to find the children's parents in various ways. Chen Shaohua, the daughter of Chen Xiufeng, a steel worker at Baotou Steel No. 2 Company, was once treated kindly by a police aunt. One day, this seven-year-old elementary school student went to see a movie with her teachers, but unfortunately, she lost her group after the show ended. At this time, it was late, and female police officer Wang Xinfu saw this little girl standing in the center of the street with a schoolbag on her back and watery eyes, so she immediately ran over and took her to her post. After work, she took her back to her dormitory. Where did the child live? She couldn't find out. Wang Xinfu comforted the child kindly, bought her steamed buns, and slept with her like a relative at night. The next morning, she washed her face, applied snow cream, and combed her braids for her. After everything was taken care of, she sent her to Youth Road Elementary School.

The female police officers who love the people have been respected and praised by the masses. They have only been in charge of traffic management for a short five months. Beautiful Kundulun continues to develop with each passing day, and the female police officers will grow and expand with the development of Kundulun! (Attached picture)

    昆都仑的姑娘
    本报记者　程竞明
    岗位
    昆都仑——钢城包头的新市区，一个从荒原上建立起来的崭新的城市。平整而宽阔的街道，纵横交叉。新市区的主要街道有一个响亮的名字——钢铁大街。这条十四里长的马路，从东到西，笔直地伸展着，跨过昆都河，通向规模宏伟的包钢厂区……
    和所有刚来这儿的人一样，我们被一个意外的景象吸引住了：在最热闹的钢铁大街和白云鄂博路的十字路口，交通警的岗位上，站的是一位女民警。皮帽子压在短发上，蓝色的制服，雪白的袖筒，腰间紧系着皮带，脚上登一双半高统的皮靴，模样真是英武。她挺着胸，熟练地挥动着手里的指挥棒。
    在青年路、友谊路、前进道和林荫西路，都有这样的女民警在巡逻。她们不时举起喇叭筒，和蔼地劝告不遵守交通规则的人：“行人走便道！”
    女民警的成长，从一个侧面反映了包钢建设事业的飞跃。工地上需要大量的强壮劳动力，在昆都仑的各个服务性行业中，妇女便成了一支生力军。交通消防民警大队也开始培养女民警。第一批十七个人，光荣地走上指挥交通的岗位。
    第二天清晨，我推开临街的窗户。月亮地里，但见马路上黑压压、密麻麻的一片。人群，像一条流不断的河水，朝着厂房的方向滚滚涌去。窗下，又响起了我所熟悉的喇叭声：“同志，请注意车辆，请注意车辆！”女民警守在岗台上，亲切地关注着行人，把他们一批批送往工地；天黑了，又在灯光下迎接他们下班，就是这样，兢兢业业维护着包钢建设者的交通安全。
    考验
    每天、每小时，有多少车辆行人从她们的面前流过啊？我拿到一份过了时的统计表。这上面记载着钢铁大街每小时的流量是：一百九十七辆汽车，三千二百二十五辆自行车，一千零九十四辆马车、牛车和一万三千二百二十五个行人。这样的数字在一个大都市，也许算不了什么，可是在包头却是值得注意的，刚解放时，全包头市总共只有九辆破烂的汽车。
    站在交通要道的十字路口，指挥那么多车马行人安全地、有秩序地通过，对于这些不久以前的农村姑娘和女学生，并不是容易的事。她们只不过受了二十多天的训练，就“以女代男”上了阵。开始时，遇着车少人稀的时候，还能对付；遇到四面同时开来许多车辆，不由得要慌手慌脚，头上冒汗。但是，凭着心细、胆大，经过一段时间以后，她们也就沉着而熟练了。从1958年国庆节——女民警第一个工作日开始，直到现在，在她们负责的地段，没有发生过一次撞车伤人的事故。
    十冬腊月，塞外朔风呼啸，寒气凛冽。你只要在露天里呆一会，眉毛、睫毛都结满了白晶晶的冰花。而女民警挺立在岗台上，顶着刺骨的冷风执行自己的职务。有时候，她们两只手像针扎似的疼痛难熬，脚跟也冻开了裂口，两个钟头站下来，身子几乎快要麻木。可是，从来没有一个人叫苦，出勤时全都是早到晚退。有几次，过路的老年人停下来，好心地向她们招呼：“姑娘，你下来暖和暖和身子吧！”女民警脸上浮出感激的笑意，摇摇头。
    有一回，因为天气很冷，十九岁的小王下岗回去悄悄倒在床铺上，用被子蒙着头哭起来。她想远在青岛的妈妈，想故乡的好天气，懊恼自己跑到这个地方来自讨苦吃。她哭了一会，想想，不对头！在这样重要的岗位上，每天手里捏着多少行人车马的安全，自己不愿干，让谁来干？畏难苟安，这是多么可耻的思想啊，没有今天的艰苦奋斗，包钢啥时才能建成？天气冷一点算得什么，在共青团员的面前没有克服不了的困难。小王这么反复一想，就像拨云见日似的，心境豁然开朗，又跟以前一样乐呵呵的了。当她向我谈起这段往事时，孩子气地摇着头，连连说：“那种思想太危险了，太危险了！”
    真是一个好姑娘，战胜了一次动摇，她变得更坚强起来，现在已经成为女民警中的先进工作者。
    “好闺女，你留个名字”
    火车不断向包头送来大批的旅客。有支援包钢的工人和专家，有新来钢城落户的公民，也有四近邻县来探亲的人民公社社员。在女民警的岗台前，每天有许多人跑来问路。新的街坊、新的住宅太多了，有时很难一下子说明白。“天天冒出新的楼房，不晓得什么时候又走出了一条路。”女民警们这样形容昆都仑的变化，也不算过份。几年前，这儿还是一片荒野，数得出来的散散落落几个小村，一共只有二百来户人家。1955年4月，昆都仑才出现了第一座砖瓦房子。打那时开始，从全国各地来建设包钢的人越来越多，一万、三万、五万……，现在居民已经将近二十万人了。女民警们对每一个来到昆都仑的劳动人民，都满怀着热情，乐意为他们效劳。
    去年10月底的一天下午，王翠玉巡逻完毕，骑着自行车回家。走到乌拉道，看见有个老农民坐在墙角发楞，身边放着包袱。“大概是迷了路”，王翠玉猜想着，立即下了车：“大爷，你来找人的吗？”老人点点头，掏出一个揉烂了的信封，上面有他儿子的地址。王翠玉看过信封，详细告诉他朝什么方向走，那个拐弯的地方有什么标记。老人听罢，露出一脸迷惘的神情。怎么办呢？王翠玉刚从那个方向来，赶了很远的路程。可是，她忘掉了自己的疲劳，马上把包袱接过来，放在车上推着，带领老人一直走到白云路的南段，挨门逐户地打听，最后找到他儿子的宿舍。老人的儿媳妇追出来连声道谢，王翠玉笑着说声“再见”，登车走了。
    扶老携幼，带领远处来的客人去找机关、找人家，几乎成了女民警下班之后的一件重要活动。她们每一个人三天两头就会遇到这种事。李淑宅和李萍还曾经一起搀扶着一位老婆婆，整整走了两个多钟头，把老婆婆送到家中。老婆婆紧紧拉着她们的手，恳切地说：“好闺女，你留个名字下来，好让我念叨念叨。”
    这些被叫做“好闺女”的警察，对于昆都仑区迷了路的小孩子来说，可真是一群可亲的阿姨和大姐姐。她们在街头巡逻的时候，在公共场所宣传交通规则的时候，发现有丢失的孩子就马上去牵着，或是抱着，想各种办法寻找小孩的家长。包钢二公司钢筋工陈秀峰的女儿陈少华，就曾受到过民警阿姨的款待。这个七岁的小学生，有一天放了学随着老师集体看电影，不料散场之后失了群。这时，天色已晚，女民警王新芙发现这个小女孩，背着书包，睁着水汪汪的大眼睛站在街中心，便立即跑过去把她牵到自己岗位旁边，下班后带回了宿舍。小孩的家住在哪里？打听不出来，王新芙亲切地安慰孩子，为她买来了馒头，夜里像亲人似地带她一起睡觉，第二天早上又替她洗脸，擦雪花膏、梳小辫子，一切收拾好了才送到青年路小学校上学去。
    热爱人民的女民警们，已经受到人民群众的尊重和赞扬。她们踏上管理交通的岗位，只不过短短五个月的功夫。美丽的昆都仑，还继续在日新月异地发展着，女民警将会随着昆都仑的发展而成长壮大！（附图片）
