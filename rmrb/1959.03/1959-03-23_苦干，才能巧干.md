Only Hard Work Leads to Skillful Work
Kong Sang

According to the Shanxi Daily, the workers of the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant are enthusiastically carrying out a "Thousand-Minute Competition" movement centered on improving labor productivity. The so-called "Thousand-Minute Competition" means that each person completes one thousand minutes (sixteen hours and forty minutes) of work within eight hours each day. According to incomplete statistics, since February 13th, more than three thousand person-times in the factory have achieved one thousand minutes of work, and more than four thousand nine hundred person-times have achieved seven hundred to nine hundred minutes of work. In February, the factory completed 139.6% of the output value plan and 236.3% of the labor productivity plan. When talking about these achievements, the workers said: "Everything comes down to the word 'skill'."

"Everything comes down to the word 'skill'," is an excellent saying. "Skill" means skillful work. That is to say, the workers can complete a thousand minutes of work in eight hours, which is the result of skillful work, that is, carrying out technological revolutions such as reforming tools, reforming equipment, and improving operating methods. For example, Wang Jinbi, an apprentice in the mechanical workshop of this factory, after promoting advanced experiences such as multi-blade drills and assembly line operations, and reforming the chuck, can complete an average of twenty-seven to thirty-two hours of work per day (eight hours). The Dong Cunrui Commando team of the freight car workshop also completed the first quarter's task one month ahead of schedule due to vigorous technological revolution. From the "Thousand-Minute Competition" in the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, we once again see the enormous power of skillful work—technological innovation. If we want to double labor productivity and make a great leap forward, we must take this path.

Saying that skillful work—the importance of technological innovation—in no way belittles the importance of hard work. In production and construction, sometimes in order to complete a certain crash task, it is of course not absolutely impossible for workers to consciously extend working hours and work late into the night, which also reflects the spirit of hard work of the workers, but it cannot be used as a regular method for completing production tasks. The hard work we advocate is the fighting spirit of being unafraid of difficulties, being unyielding, and painstakingly studying technology. This spirit of hard work is a manifestation of soaring energy and is indispensable at any time.

As the saying goes: "Practice makes perfect." "Practice" means being familiar with the objective laws of the production process and the performance and structure of tools and equipment. Therefore, to work skillfully, one must study hard, constantly enrich one's knowledge, improve technical level, and gradually recognize and master the objective laws of production. No reform can be correct with one thought or effective with one try. In particular, important reforms and creations in production technology often require one experiment after another, and one failure and setback after another before finally achieving success. Just to give an example. On March 6th, the Shanghai Liberation Daily had a message saying that Chen Xiulin, a national youth socialist construction activist and worker at the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, in the process of recently converting an old belt lathe into a universal automated lathe, went through twenty-three experimental failures in the automatic tool changing part alone before succeeding on the twenty-fourth attempt. Here, not only must there be a style of daring to think and dare to do, but also a spirit of hard work that is unafraid of difficulties, unyielding, and daring to forge ahead on rugged paths.

It can be seen that hard work and skillful work are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Hard work is the guarantee of skillful work, and without the spirit of hard work, there is no way to talk about skillful work. Without skillful work, hard work will not bear rich fruits. Only hard work plus skillful work can create miracles.

    苦干，才能巧干
    孔桑
    据山西日报报道：太原机车车辆厂职工，正在热烈开展一个以提高劳动生产率为中心的“千分竞赛”运动。所谓“千分竞赛”，就是每人每天在八小时内，完成一千分钟（十六小时又四十分）的工作量。据不完全统计，从2月13日以来，全厂达到千分钟工时的已有三千多人次，达到七百至九百分钟工时的有四千九百多人次。2月份全厂完成产值计划139.6％，劳动生产率计划完成236.3％。在谈到这些成就的时候，工人们说：“万事都出在一个‘巧’字上。”
    “万事都出在一个‘巧’字上”，这话讲得好极了。“巧”，就是巧干。就是说，工人们能够在八小时内完成千分钟工作量，莫不是巧干，即开展改革工具、改革设备、改进操作方法等技术革命的结果。例如这个厂的机械车间徒工王晋璧，推行了多刃钻头、流水作业等先进经验和改革了卡具以后，平均每天（八小时）可以完成二十七到三十二小时的工作量。货车车间董存瑞突击队，也由于大搞技术革命，提前一个月完成了第一季度的任务。从太原机车车辆厂的“千分竞赛”中，我们再一次看到了巧干——革新技术的巨大威力。要想成倍地提高劳动生产率，要想大跃进，非走这一条路不可。
    说巧干——技术革新的重要，绝没有贬低苦干的重要性的意思。在生产和建设中，有时候为了完成某种突击任务，工人们自觉地延长劳动时间，挑灯夜战，当然不是绝对不可以的，这也体现了工人的苦干精神，但不能把它作为完成生产任务的经常方法。我们所提倡的苦干，是不怕困难，不屈不挠，苦心钻研技术的战斗精神。这种苦干精神正是冲天干劲的表现，任何时候都少不了。
    俗话说：“熟能生巧”。“熟”，就是熟悉生产过程的客观规律，熟悉工具和设备的性能和构造。所以要巧干，就得刻苦钻研，不断丰富自己的知识，提高技术水平，逐步认识和掌握生产的客观规律。任何一种改革不可能一想就对，一试就灵的。特别是生产技术上的重要改革和创造，往往要经过一次又一次试验，一次又一次的失败和挫折才得到最后的成功。随便举个例子说吧。3月6日上海解放日报有一条消息，说全国青年社会主义建设积极分子、上海柴油机厂工人陈修林同志，在最近把一部破旧的皮带车床改装成全能自动化车床的过程中，仅仅在自动换刀部分，就经过二十三次的试验失败，到第二十四次试验才成功。在这里，不但要有敢想敢做的风格，还要有不怕困难，不屈不挠，敢于在崎岖小路上勇往直前的苦干精神。
    由此可见，苦干和巧干是相辅相成，相得益彰的。苦干是巧干的保证，没有苦干精神，就根本谈不上巧干。没有巧干，苦干就不会结出丰硕的果实。只有苦干加上巧干，才能创造奇迹。
