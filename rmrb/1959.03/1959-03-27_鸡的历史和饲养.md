    The History and Raising of Chickens
    Shí Yīchén
    All over the country, the chicken raising industry is being greatly developed to meet the needs of people's lives. Chickens are also one of the most familiar domestic fowls to people, but have we ever thought about: what did chickens evolve from? Where is their old home? What are their benefits to mankind? How should we raise them?
    The ancestor of the chicken is called the Red Junglefowl, which lives in the warm south. Our neighbors India, Burma, and Malaya are their dear hometowns. Even now, their traces can still be found in these places and in the forests of southern China.
    The Red Junglefowl's body is lighter than a chicken's, and its wings are not long, but it flies higher than a chicken, and likes to perch in trees. A female Red Junglefowl only lays eight to twelve eggs a year, and the male Red Junglefowl also likes to sing.
    About five thousand years ago, due to the breeding and selection of the working people, they began to become friends of mankind and gradually changed their nature. About four thousand years ago, chickens came to China from India as the first "envoys of peace."
    The chicken family has four branches.
    The first branch is called egg-laying chickens, the most famous of which is called the Leghorn chicken, which can lay a record of three hundred and sixty-eight eggs a year, more than thirty times the number of eggs laid by the Red Junglefowl. Recently, in the Soviet Union, the method of conditioned reflex was also used to insert an artificial night during the day, so that chickens can lay two eggs a day. In this way, the highest egg-laying record of chickens will be greatly increased.
    The second branch is called meat chickens. In our country, the most famous are the Langshan chicken and the Jiujin Yellow chicken. The Langshan chicken is produced in Langshan, Nantong, Jiangsu. They are strong and not prone to illness. According to recent reports, their maximum weight has reached more than fourteen pounds. The Jiujin Yellow chicken is cultivated by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing. Their bodies are almost like a ball, their feathers are full, they are not afraid of the cold, and they are suitable for raising in the north.
    The third branch is called fighting cocks. They are closest to their ancestor, the Red Junglefowl, brave and good at fighting, and are very good acrobats.
    In addition, there are long-tailed chickens, short-tailed chickens, and short-legged chickens, which are a branch of the chicken family. They can also be used for food, but they are mainly for people to enjoy. All chickens love to eat weeds and pests, and make great contributions to agriculture. In 1940, the sugar beet weevil was rampant in Ukraine. The collected beetles alone weighed more than 13,000 tons, which not only reduced the harvest by half, but also cost more than 137 million rubles for mechanical or chemical control. At that time, according to Lysenko's suggestion, only a hundred or so chickens were released in one hectare of land, and the weevils were eaten up.
    In addition, chicken manure is a high-quality fertilizer, and its fertilizer effect is two to three times higher than that of horse manure. Chicken feathers can also be used as fertilizer, writing brushes, feather dusters, etc.
    Generally speaking, chickens are not very resistant to heat and cold. They like dry air, warm sunshine, love exercise, hate dirt, like to eat all kinds of food, and need various nutrients. Also, since the Red Junglefowl grandfather lived in trees at night, chickens still retain the habit of climbing to high places to roost.
    Therefore, when we raise chickens, it is best to prepare a relatively spacious wooden house for the chickens, and each chicken should have an area of three feet square. The wooden house should have more windows so that there is plenty of sunshine and air circulation; roosts should be set up in the wooden house, about two feet high; manure boards should be set up under the roosts so that it is easier to collect manure. Some chicken coops covered with dry grass can be arranged in the wooden house as the hen's laying bed.
    The area near the wooden house should be relatively open, and some trees should be planted so that they can exercise and enjoy the shade. There are feeders and drinkers so that they are not hungry or thirsty.
    In addition, in terms of food, in addition to finding some weed seeds and pests themselves, they can also be fed some bran, chaff, green vegetable leaves, etc. In winter, add some blood meal, bone meal and other meat dishes.

    鸡的历史和饲养
    石一辰
    全国各地正在大大发展养鸡事业，以满足人们生活的需要。鸡也是人们最熟悉的一种家禽，但是我们是否想过：鸡是由什么东西进化来的？它们的老家在哪里？它们对人类有什么利益？我们应当怎样饲养它们呢？
    鸡的祖先叫做原鸡，生活在温暖的南方。我国的邻邦印度、缅甸和马来亚，是它们亲爱的故乡。现在在这些地方和我国南部的森林里，仍然可以找到它们的踪迹。
    原鸡的身体比鸡轻巧，翅膀也不长，但是比鸡飞得高些，喜欢栖息在树上。母原鸡一年只生八到十二个蛋，公原鸡也很喜欢歌唱。
    大约在五千年前，由于劳动人民的饲养和选择，它们开始成了人类的朋友，并逐渐改变着自己的本性。大约在四千年前，鸡便作为第一批“和平使者”，从印度来到了中国。
    鸡的一族共有四房人家。
    长房叫做卵用鸡，其中最有名的叫做来亨鸡，最高纪录一年能够生三百六十八个蛋，比原鸡的生蛋数字翻了三十几番。最近在苏联还利用条件反射的方法，在一个白天里插入一个人为的黑夜，使鸡一天生两个蛋。这样，鸡的最高生蛋纪录又将大大提高了。
    二房叫做肉用鸡，在我国，最有名的有狼山鸡和九斤黄鸡。狼山鸡产在江苏南通狼山。它们身体强壮，不大生病。据最近报载，它们的体重最高已经达到十四斤多了。九斤黄鸡是北京郊区农民培育的。它们的身体几乎像一个圆球，羽毛丰满，不怕寒冷，适宜于在北方喂养。
    三房叫做斗鸡、它们和祖先原鸡最接近，英勇善斗，是很好的杂技演员。
    此外还有长尾鸡、短尾鸡、矮脚鸡，是鸡族里的一房。它们也可以供食用，但是主要是供人们赏玩的。所有的鸡都爱吃杂草和害虫，对农业有很大的贡献。1940年在乌克兰，甜菜象鼻虫曾经猖獗一时，光是收集的甲虫就有一万三千多吨，不仅使收成减低一半，而且用于机械或化学防治的费用就超过了一亿三千七百万卢布。当时根据李森科的建议，一公顷田里只放了百把只鸡，就把象鼻虫吃光了。
    此外，鸡的粪便是上等肥料，比起马粪来，肥效要高两三倍。鸡的羽毛也可以做肥料、毛笔、鸡毛掸等。
    一般来说，鸡不大能耐热和耐寒，它们喜欢干燥的空气，温暖的阳光，热爱运动，讨厌肮脏，欢喜杂食，需要各种营养料。还有，由于原鸡爷爷夜间是住在树上的，鸡至今仍然保留着登高栖息的习惯。
    因此我们饲养鸡，最好给鸡准备一个比较宽敞的木房，每只鸡应当有三尺见方的面积。木房子要多开窗户，使阳光充足，空气流通；木房里要设置栖木，高约两尺；栖木下设置粪板，这样收集粪便也方便些。木房里可以布置一些铺干草的鸡窠，作为母鸡的产床。
    在木房附近应当比较空旷，栽些树木，以便它们运动和乘凉。有食槽和饮水器，使它们不致饥渴。
    此外，食物方面，除了它们自己可以找一些杂草种子和害虫外，还可以适当喂一些麸、糠、青菜叶等。冬天另外拌进一些血粉、骨粉等荤菜。
