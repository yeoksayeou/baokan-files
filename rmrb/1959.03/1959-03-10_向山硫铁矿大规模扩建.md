    Large-scale expansion project of Xiangshan Iron Pyrite Mine has entered the final stage of intense construction, and is expected to be completed and put into production in June this year.
    Xiangshan Iron Pyrite Mine, located in Xiangshan Town, Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, is one of the earliest and largest iron pyrite mines in China. It is now being developed into an important base for iron pyrite in Central China. In the early days of liberation, this mine was considered to have limited resources and no future development prospects. However, after three years of active exploration by geological personnel, it has been confirmed that there are still considerable underground resources. Furthermore, a reserve mining area with reserves of about 100 million tons has been discovered outside the original mining area. Therefore, a large-scale expansion project was started last July on the basis of the original mine. After the first phase of the expansion project is put into production, the production capacity will increase from 150,000 tons last year to 1.1 million tons.

    向山硫铁矿大规模扩建
    向山硫铁矿大规模的扩建工程，已经进入最后紧张施工阶段，预计今年6月可全部完工投入生产。
    向山硫铁矿，在安徽省马鞍山市向山镇，是我国硫铁矿开采较早、规模较大的矿山之一，现在将发展为华中硫铁矿重要基地。这个矿在解放初期，被认为资源不多，已经没有发展前途，但是经过了地质人员三年来的积极勘查，证实井下资源仍然不少，并且在原来矿区外围另发现了储量有一亿吨左右的后备矿区，因此从去年7月份在原有基础上开始进行大规模的扩建工作。这一期扩建工程投入生产后，生产能力将由去年年产十五万吨提高到一百一十万吨。
