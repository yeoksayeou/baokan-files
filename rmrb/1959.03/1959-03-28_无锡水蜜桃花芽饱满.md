Brief News:

    Wuxi water蜜桃 peaches from Jiangsu are known throughout the country for their large fruit, abundant juice, and sweet taste. At present, communes in the peach-producing areas are stepping up the management of their peach orchards. Since the beginning of spring, the communes have successively organized specialized teams to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer for the peach orchards by clearing pits, clearing circles, and clearing garbage. They also carried out soil turning, fertilization, pruning, and weeding in the peach orchards early. Disinfection and pest control are currently underway. This year, the peach trees generally have more than half as many flower buds as last year, and each bud is plump and strong, foreshadowing a greater harvest of water蜜桃 peaches this year.

    无锡水蜜桃花芽饱满
    江苏无锡水蜜桃以果硕、汁多、味甜而闻名各地。目前各产桃地区的公社，正在加紧桃园管理。入春以来，各公社都先后组织了专业队，用清坑、清圈、清垃圾等办法，为桃园积下了大批肥料。并提早进行了桃园的翻土、施肥、修剪、除草等工作。目前正在进行消毒和除虫工作。今年桃树的花芽一般比去年多一半以上，而且朵朵饱满茁壮，预兆今年水蜜桃将获更大丰收。
