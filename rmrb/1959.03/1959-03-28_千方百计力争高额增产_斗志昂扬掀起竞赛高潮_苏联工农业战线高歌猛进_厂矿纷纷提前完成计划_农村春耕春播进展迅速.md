Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: Our correspondent reports: The socialist emulation movement launched by workers in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union to complete the production tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule is developing vigorously, with a momentum like galloping horses. Long before the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when the Soviet Union announced the draft of the control figures for the Seven-Year Plan, workers in industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet Union were determined to work hard in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. After the 21st Congress, newspapers were filled with competition challenge letters and response letters from all directions to increase production tasks. This mass production competition, which was strongly supported by the Party and trade union organizations, quickly spread to all industrial sectors and enterprises throughout the country. In the competition, workers in various regions generally revised and raised the original production targets of their units. According to the actual situation, many industrial departments proposed completing the Seven-Year Plan one, two, or even three years ahead of schedule. Currently, a vigorous nationwide competition is underway to win the honorary title of "Communist Labor Team." According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-March, more than 85,900 labor teams and workshops across the Soviet Union had participated in this movement, becoming shock workers in completing this year's production plan.

Although this nationwide competition movement has just begun, judging from the production achievements made in various regions over the past two months, it has shown unparalleled vitality. Many factories in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, the Baltic coastal republics, and the Central Asian republics have completed their production tasks for January and February ahead of schedule and are successfully completing their plans for March. For example, in Ukraine, an important industrial base of the Soviet Union, miners produced 88,000 tons of coal for the state above the plan in February alone. Steel workers in the republic also completed 102.3% of the steel production plan, 102% of the steel products production plan, and 100.9% of the pig iron production plan in February, producing hundreds of tons of various high-quality steel for the state. Currently, production reports are constantly coming from all over the country.

With the increasing development of the competition movement, the initiatives and measures proposed by workers in various regions to improve labor productivity and increase production are increasing. Young workers in the instrument workshop of the Internal Combustion Locomotive Power Equipment Factory in the Kharkov region proposed to guarantee that they would complete the task of increasing labor productivity stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan within five years. In Moscow, the Maksimosheva and Marininkova production teams of the famous "Three Mountains" textile factory proposed to improve labor productivity in every production process. They organized a competition between production teams to achieve this guarantee, and as a result, the daily and monthly production tasks of the production teams were overfulfilled by an average of about 120%. This initiative is currently being promoted to other regions and other enterprises. The Drozdova production team of the Leningrad "Proletarian Victory" factory completes its production tasks at 150% above the plan every day.

Another feature of this year's production competition is that, while striving to improve labor productivity and product output, workers in various regions pay close attention to reducing product costs. Currently, a nationwide savings movement to save materials and labor is being carried out in various industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union. The Gorky Automobile Factory stipulates that each worker should save an average of 1,500 rubles worth of materials in production this year. Workers in many factories in Leningrad proposed to practice thrift when designing each new product, saving a total of 15,000 tons of ferrous and non-ferrous metals for the country throughout the year in this regard. Due to the further reduction in product costs, workers in Leningrad will save 100 million rubles for the country this year. In Kharkov, a famous machine manufacturing industrial city, factories have saved 3,500 tons of steel and 19 tons of non-ferrous metals for the country so far. Industrial enterprises in other places are also further mobilizing the masses, carrying out technological innovations, inventions, creations, and putting forward more rationalization proposals to improve labor productivity and practice thrift.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: Our correspondent reports: The vibrant spring has arrived on the vast Soviet land. Ukraine has melted the last snow, peach blossoms in Moldova and Uzbekistan have already budded, and the thawing Volga River is rippling with spring waves. On the boundless fields of Kuban and southern Kazakhstan, the roar of tractors echoes day and night. In the first spring of the Seven-Year Plan, rural areas throughout the Soviet Union have fully launched tense spring plowing and sowing. All Soviet agricultural workers are striving to achieve a bumper harvest on the agricultural front in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan.

In December last year, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU put forward a new combat task to all Soviet agricultural workers—to greatly increase grain production, and by 1965, grain output should reach 9 billion to 11 billion poods. At the same time, the production of animal husbandry, economic and technical crops should also be greatly increased. This inspiring call from the Party was warmly responded to by the vast rural areas. Since January this year, collective farms and state farms in various regions have successively launched discussions on completing the agricultural Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and then launched a nationwide production competition between states, districts, and farms to complete the Seven-Year Plan tasks for meat, milk, and grain ahead of schedule. Currently, this competition has entered a new stage of development with the beginning of spring plowing. Because the spring plowing preparation work was done well in the competition, coupled with the early arrival of a sunny spring, this year's spring plowing and sowing started earlier than in previous years. This has created favorable conditions for a bumper harvest this year.

This year, on the basis of the further consolidation of the Soviet collective farm system and the increasing improvement of agricultural mechanization, the basic method of obtaining more agricultural products is to increase the yield per unit area. Many state farms and collective farms have proposed guarantees to strive to produce four to five quintals more grain per hectare this year. For example, Kazakhstan, the second granary of the Soviet Union, strives to harvest 1.5 billion poods of grain this year on the same cultivated area as last year, that is, an increase of 200 million poods compared with last year. Agricultural workers in this republic have decided to increase the average grain yield per hectare by about three quintals this year.

In order to ensure the increase in yield per unit area, this year all republics have paid special attention to seed selection and fertilizer accumulation, repaired a large number of agricultural machines early, and strived to achieve careful cultivation and intensive farming. More than 14,000 collective farms and all state farms in the Ukrainian Republic have selected seeds in advance and decided to sow carefully selected high-quality seeds on all cultivated land. Ukraine has accumulated 10 million tons more fertilizer than last year, and the amount of manure and peat accumulated in the first two months of this year alone reached 40 million tons. This year's seed selection in Kazakhstan is better than in previous years, and more than 70% of the republic's cultivated area will be sown with high-quality seeds. This is unprecedented in the history of the republic, and it has a significant effect on ensuring large-scale high yield this year.

Inspired by the magnificent Seven-Year Plan for building communism, farmers in various regions are particularly enthusiastic about labor in spring plowing and sowing. Many collective farms have established production teams to strive for the title of "Communist Labor Team." In the southern region of Kazakhstan, more than 300,000 hectares of wheat, barley, and alfalfa were successfully sown in just two or three days. On hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in Ukraine and the southern region of the Russian Federation, collective farm members sowed the first batch of seeds of various crops day and night. In order to strive for early rice and early harvest, the villagers unanimously advocated that the spring sowing should be completed in about eight days. Many mass initiatives for quick plowing and quick sowing have emerged. The "Stalin," "Russia," and "Kirov" collective farms in Abinsk district, Kuban, sowed seeds on more than 2,000 hectares of land each in the first two days due to a more rational arrangement of machinery and manpower. The "Lenin" and other collective farms in Jambylsk overfulfilled the planned sowing task by 10%-20% every day. (Attached picture)

    千方百计力争高额增产　斗志昂扬掀起竞赛高潮
    苏联工农业战线高歌猛进
    厂矿纷纷提前完成计划　农村春耕春播进展迅速
    新华社莫斯科27日电　本社记者报道：苏联各工业部门职工为提前完成七年计划第一年的生产任务而展开的社会主义竞赛运动，正以高歌猛进、万马奔腾之势向前发展着。远在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会以前，当苏联公布了七年计划的控制数字草案时，全苏联各地工业企业的职工就斗志昂扬决心要在七年计划的第一年中大干一番。二十一大以后，报刊上充满了来自四面八方的提高生产任务的竞赛挑战书和应战书。这一受到党和工会组织大力支持的群众性生产竞赛，很快就遍及全国各地工业部门和各工业企业。竞赛中，各地的职工普遍改订和提高了本单位原订的生产指标，不少工业部门的工人根据实际情况，纷纷提出提前一年、两年甚至三年完成七年计划。目前全国轰轰烈烈地展开了争取获得“共产主义劳动队”光荣称号的竞赛。据不完全统计，到3月中旬为止，苏联全国已经有八万五千九百多个劳动队和车间参加了这一运动，它们成为完成今年生产计划的突击手。
    现在这个全民性的竞赛运动虽然刚刚开始，但是根据两个多月来各地所取得的生产成就来看，它已经显出无比的活力。俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆以及波罗的海沿岸和中亚细亚各加盟共和国的许多工厂都提前完成了今年1月和2月份的生产任务，并且正在胜利地完成3月份的计划。例如，在苏联的重要工业基地乌克兰共和国，矿工们单在2月份就超计划为国家多生产了八万八千吨煤。共和国的钢铁工人2月份也完成了钢生产计划102.3％，钢材生产计划102％，生铁生产计划100.9％，为国家多生产了几百吨各种优质钢。目前，生产捷报还不断从全国各地传来。
    随着竞赛运动的日益发展，各地职工们提出的提高劳动生产率和增加生产的倡议和措施日益增多。哈尔科夫州的内燃机车动力设备工厂仪表车间的青年工人提出保证，要在五年内完成七年计划规定的提高劳动生产率的任务。在莫斯科，著名的“三山”纺织厂的马克西莫谢娃和玛丽宁科娃两个生产小组提出，在每个生产工序上都要提高劳动生产率。她们组织了实现这一保证的生产小组之间竞赛，结果生产小组每天的和每月的生产任务都平均超额完成120％左右。这一倡议目前正向其他地区和其他企业推广中。列宁格勒“无产阶级胜利”工厂的德罗茨多娃生产小组天天都超计划150％完成生产任务。
    今年生产竞赛的另一个特点是，各地职工们在努力提高劳动生产率和产品产量的同时，十分注意降低产品成本。目前，苏联各工业企业正开展着一个节省材料和劳动力的全民性节约运动。高尔基汽车工厂规定今年每个工人在生产中平均要节省价值一千五百卢布的材料。列宁格勒许多工厂的职工倡议在设计每一个新产品时都要厉行节约，全年在这方面总共要为国家节省一万五千吨黑色金属和有色金属。由于产品成本的进一步降低，列宁格勒市的工人今年将为国家节约一亿卢布。在著名的机器制造工业城市哈尔科夫，各工厂至今已为国家节省了三千五百吨钢铁和十九吨有色金属。其他地方的工业企业也都在为提高劳动生产率和厉行节约而进一步发动群众，进行技术革新，发明创造和多提合理化建议。
    新华社莫斯科25日电　本社记者报道：充满着朝气蓬勃的春天已经来到了辽阔的苏维埃大地。乌克兰已经消融了最后一片积雪，摩尔达维亚、乌兹别克的扁桃花业已鼓起花蕾，解冻的伏尔加河的流水泛起了阵阵春波。在库班、哈萨克南部无边的田野上，夜以继日地响彻着拖拉机的吼声。在这七年计划第一个春天里，苏联各地农村已经全面展开了紧张的春耕春播。全苏农业劳动者努力争取在七年计划的第一年在农业战线上获得大丰收。
    去年12月，苏共中央全会向全苏农业劳动者提出了新的战斗任务——大力增加谷物生产，到1965年，谷物产量要达到九十亿到一百一十亿普特，同时，畜牧业、经济技术作物的生产也要大大增加。党的这一振奋人心的号召得到了广大农村的热烈响应。从今年1月起，各地集体农庄和国营农场先后展开了关于提前完成农业七年计划的讨论，接着开展了全国规模的州与州、区与区、农庄与农庄之间为提前完成肉类、牛奶、谷物七年计划任务的生产竞赛。目前，这个竞赛随着春耕的开始，已经进入了新的发展阶段。由于在竞赛中春耕准备工作做得好，加上阳光和煦的春天来得早，因此今年的春耕春播比往年开始得早。这就为今年获得丰收创造了有利条件。
    今年，在苏联集体农庄制度进一步巩固、农业机械化日益完善的基础上，获得更多农产品的基本方法是提高单位面积产量。许多国营农场和集体农庄纷纷提出保证，争取今年每公顷土地多出产四到五公担谷物。例如，苏联第二谷仓哈萨克今年在同去年同样的耕种面积上，争取收获十五亿普特谷物，即比去年增产二亿普特。这个共和国农业劳动者决定，今年每公顷土地平均增产三公担左右的谷物。
    为了保证单位面积产量的提高，今年各共和国都特别注意了选种、积肥工作，提早修好了大批农业机器，在耕作中做到精耕细作。乌克兰共和国的一万四千多个集体农庄和所有的国营农场，都提前选好了种子，决定在全部耕地面积上播种精选的优质种子。乌克兰比去年多积一千万吨肥料，仅在今年头两个月所积集的粪肥和泥炭就达四千万吨。哈萨克今年的选种比往年要好，共和国70％以上的耕种面积将播种优质种子。这是共和国历史上前所未有过的，这对保证今年大面积高产有着重大的作用。
    被建设共产主义的雄伟的七年计划鼓舞着的各地农民们，在春耕春播中劳动热情格外高涨。许许多多的集体农庄建立了争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产队。在哈萨克南部地区，仅在两三天内就顺利地播下了三十多万公顷小麦、大麦和紫苜蓿。在乌克兰、俄罗斯联邦南部地区的数十万公顷土地上，集体农庄庄员们夜以继日地播种下第一批各种作物的种子。为了争取早稻早收，庄员们一致主张，要用八天左右的时间全部结束春播。许多快耕快播的群众倡议涌现了出来。库班的阿宾斯克区的“斯大林”、“俄罗斯”、“基洛夫”三个集体农庄，由于更合理地安排了机器和人力，头两天就各在二千多公顷土地上播下了种子。詹布耳斯克的“列宁”等集体农庄，每天都超额10％—20％完成预定的播种任务。（附图片）
