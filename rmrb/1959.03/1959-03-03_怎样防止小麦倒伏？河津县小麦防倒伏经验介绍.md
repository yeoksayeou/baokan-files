How to Prevent Wheat Lodging?
Introduction to the Experience of Preventing Wheat Lodging in Hejin County
Wang Zhiying

Whether wheat lodges or not has a significant impact on yield. According to past experience, lodging generally reduces yield by 10%-20%; if it lodges during the flowering stage, the reduction will be more than 30%.

In 1958, the five high-yield units in Hejin County, Shanxi Province, which achieved yields of over 2,000 jin per mu, had a common characteristic: they did not lodge, or lodged late and little. Judging from their cultivation management measures and the wheat's growth, the main reasons were reasonable fertilization and watering, even plant distribution, good ventilation, sufficient sunlight, and adequate supply of major elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As a result, the wheat not only grew rapidly but also developed strong and well-proportioned stems.

Summarizing their experience, there are the following points:

	Plant more seeds and use wider rows

In 1958, the row spacing of the five high-yield units in Hejin County was all 2.5 to 4 cun, and the seeding rate was more than 30 jin per mu. The number of plants per mu was at least 600,000, and some even reached more than 720,000. Generally, the wheat grew well without lodging or with very little lodging.

What is the reason for this? The main reason is their wide rows. The narrowest row width of the five high-yield units was more than 2.5 cun, and some were as wide as 4 cun. Because the row width was widened, the plants were evenly distributed, and each plant had a certain nutritional area, which not only reduced water evaporation but also correspondingly improved the utilization rate of fertilizer. This was conducive to root development, and at the same time, the upper part had good ventilation and sufficient sunlight, which strengthened photosynthesis. Therefore, the wheat grew strong and developed evenly, not only avoiding lodging but also maturing uniformly.

	Postpone jointing irrigation
	Increase booting irrigation

Wheat lodging is closely related to the strength of the first and second internodes at the base. Therefore, strengthening management during the growth period of the first and second internodes is very important; especially the role of watering is even more significant.

The wheat of Chaijia Agricultural Cooperative in Chaijia Township, which produced more than 2,200 jin per mu in 1958, was managed in this way: Although the weather was dry and water was urgently needed when the wheat began to joint, they watered five days later than usual, but irrigated twice continuously during the booting stage. The wheat in the high-yield area not only did not lodge but also had full grains. Other plots lodged by 50% due to early watering. The reason is that appropriately controlling water when the wheat is jointing allows the cell walls to thicken. Although this temporarily inhibited growth, the plant tissue became dense. Especially at the right time for jointing, doing so can make the first and second internodes at the base short and strong, laying a good foundation for preventing lodging.

In order to make the grains full, the ears large, and the yield high, the watering during the booting stage should not only be frequent but also large in quantity. During this period, wheat needs water most urgently, and with the jointing irrigation postponed, the moisture should be sufficient at this time so that the wheat can develop strongly and grow rapidly.

	Apply potash fertilizer early

In terms of topdressing, the five high-yield units with yields of over 2,000 jin generally used mixed fertilizers, and single fertilizers were used less. Winter and early spring topdressing were human manure and well-rotted barnyard manure. After jointing, mixed fertilizers and single-nature fertilizers were topdressed according to the growth of the seedlings. From the perspective of the wheat's own growth requirements, this is extremely reasonable. Because the main elements of wheat plant composition are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron, sulfur is also indispensable. The requirements of wheat at various growth stages are different. If only ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate are applied, there will be too much nitrogen, resulting in rapid growth and loose tissue, which reduces the tissue layer of the cell membrane, making it not only prone to lodging but also susceptible to diseases and insect pests. Conversely, if only phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are applied, nitrogen cannot be well utilized. Liu Zhimin, deputy director of the Fulida Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, cultivated an experimental field with a yield of more than 2,200 jin per mu by applying nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers at the same time. He topdressed 20 jin of ammonium sulfate and 10 jin of superphosphate per mu during the jointing stage, and the wheat seedlings grew oily green and very vigorous, without any excessive growth.

Judging from the growth of high-yield wheat in 1958, potash fertilizer must be applied early. Although wheat absorbs potash fertilizer from the soil from the first day of growth until flowering, it is still better to apply it early in practice. For example, in the experimental fields cultivated by the director and deputy director of the Fulida Cooperative in Chengguan Township, when applying wood ash (the amount applied per mu was 500 jin), the deputy director applied it at the "Qingming" festival when the wheat seedlings were about to start jointing, while the director applied it at the "Guyu" festival. As a result, part of the deputy director's experimental field was semi-lodged at maturity, but the director's experimental field was completely lodged in the late flowering stage.

	Early spring harrowing and rolling

Harrowing and rolling in early spring makes the soil compact, the wheat roots firm, and avoids frost damage. More importantly, rolling can appropriately inhibit growth, make the tillering nodes close to the soil, cause water to flow in, accelerate the formation of new secondary roots, slow down the growth of large tillers, and quickly catch up with small tillers. In this way, the wheat seedlings are not only strong but also grow neatly, which has a great effect on preventing lodging.

The experience of the masses over the years is also like this. The wheat of the Qinlian Cooperative in Ganjian Township, Hejin, always harrows once, harrows again, and then rolls once every year after returning to green and before jointing. The masses reflected that although this can damage some of the wheat seedlings, the grown wheat stalks are thick, hard, and grow neatly and evenly.

	Watering according to the weather, deep plowing
	Apply more base fertilizer

Do not water on windy days, especially in the later stages of growth
(booting to flowering) should pay more attention. According to experiments by the Chengguan Fulida Cooperative, this point is also related to preventing lodging. An experimental high-yield plot of the cooperative was just beginning to flower when it was watered, and then a strong wind came, and as a result, this plot lodged more severely than other plots. After watering, the ground was wet and soft. Because the wheat was already heavy in the later stage, it was bound to lodge due to the strong pressure of the wind and the soft roots.

In 1958, the land of high-yield units in Hejin with a yield of over 2,000 jin per mu was generally deeply plowed and had sufficient base fertilizer. The plowing depth was generally more than one chi, and the amount of base fertilizer used was at least more than 13,000 jin, and some even reached 20,000 jin, all using layered and phased fertilization. Wheat is a deep-rooted crop. Loose soil and sufficient base fertilizer, and the fertilizer is very complete, so the root system will develop well, and the phenomenon of excessive nitrogen fertilizer, luxuriant branches and leaves, and insufficient balance between the upper and lower parts will be avoided. This link is also an important measure to prevent lodging.

    怎样防止小麦倒伏？
    河津县小麦防倒伏经验介绍
    王志英
    小麦倒伏和不倒伏，对产量关系很大。根据历年经验：倒伏的一般减产均在10％—20％；如果在扬花期卧倒，减产将在30％以上。
    1958年，山西省河津县出现的五个高额丰产单位，每亩产量都在二千斤以上，它们有一个共同特点是不倒伏，或倒的迟、倒的少。从他们的加工管理措施和小麦生长情况看，主要是施肥浇水合理，植株分布均匀，通风良好，阳光充足，氮、磷、钾等主要元素的肥料供应得当，不但生长迅速，而且茎秆发育粗壮、匀称。
    综合他们的经验，有下面几点：
  多下种，播幅宽
    1958年河津县五个高额丰产的行距都是二点五到四寸，每亩播种量都在三十斤以上，每亩株数少的也在六十万株以上，多的还到七十二万多株，一般生长良好，没有倒伏或倒伏很少。
    这是什么原因呢？主要原因是他们的播幅宽。五个丰产单位最窄的播幅也在二点五寸以上，宽的还有达四寸的。因为播幅加宽后，植株分布均匀，每株都有一定的营养面积，不但减少了水分蒸发，相应地也提高了肥料的利用率，既利于根系发育，同时上部通风良好，阳光充足，光合作用加强，所以小麦生长健壮，发育匀称，不仅避免了倒伏，而且成熟一致。
  推迟拔节水
      增多孕穗水
    小麦倒伏和基部一、二节间的强度关系很大。因此，在一、二节的生长期加强管理，意义是非常重要的；尤其是浇水作用更为显著。
    柴家乡柴家农业社1958年亩产二千二百多斤的麦子就是这样管理的：在麦子开始拔节时，虽然天气干旱，需水迫切；但他们比一般地迟五天浇水，在孕穗期却连浇了两次。丰产地的麦子不但没倒，而且籽粒饱满。其他地块由于浇的早，倒伏了50％。其原因是麦子在拔节起身时，适当控制水分，使细胞壁加厚，这虽然暂时抑制了一下生长，但植株组织紧密。尤其是正当起身时机，这样做，可以使基部一、二节短而壮实，给防止倒伏打下了良好基础。
    为使籽粒饱满，穗大粒多，产量提高，在孕穗期浇水不但次数要多，而且量要大。这期间麦子需水最为迫切，加上拔节水推迟了，所以这时水分应充足，使小麦发育健壮，生长迅速。
      早施钾肥
    五个双千斤以上的高额丰产单位在施追肥方面，一般用的是混合肥料，单一肥料少。冬季和早春追肥都是人粪尿和腐熟的厩肥，拔节后根据禾苗生长情况追施了混合肥及单一性质的肥料。从小麦本身生育的要求看，这是极其合理的。因为小麦植株构成的主要元素是氮、磷、钾、钙、镁、铁，硫也是不可缺少的。小麦在各个生育阶段的要求是不同的，如果光施硫酸铵和硝酸铵，则氮素过多，形成生长迅速，组织松散，使细胞膜的组织层减少，不但容易倒伏，而且易受病虫侵袭。相反的只施磷钾肥料，氮素又不能很好被利用。城关乡福利农业社副主任刘志民培育的亩产二千二百多斤试验田就是同时施用氮磷肥料的。他在拔节期每亩追硫酸铵二十斤，过磷酸钙十斤，麦苗长的油绿，又很茁壮，没有徒长现象。
    从1958年高额丰产小麦的生长情况看，钾肥必须早施。虽然小麦由生长的第一天开始直到开花为止，都从土壤中吸收到钾肥，但从实践中看，早施还是好一些。如城关乡福利社主任和副主任同样培育的试验田，在施草木灰时（每亩施量均是五百斤），副主任是在“清明”节麦苗刚要起身时施入的，而社主任却在“谷雨”节才施入，结果副主任的试验田在成熟时有部分呈半倒伏，可是社主任的试验田在扬花后期就全部倒伏。
    早春耙耱镇压
    早春耙地镇压，一方面使土壤紧密，麦根严实，避免冻害。更重要的是，通过镇压可以适当抑制一下生长，使分蘖节接近土壤，引起水分流入，加速形成新的二次根，使大蘖生长缓慢，小蘖迅速赶上，这样麦苗不但壮实而且生长整齐，对防止倒伏作用很大。
    群众历年经验也是这样。河津干涧乡勤俭社的小麦，每年返青后拔节前，总要耙一次，耱一次，紧接着碾压一次。群众反映说：这样虽然可以损伤一部分麦苗，可是长起来的麦秆子粗壮，而且坚硬，同时生长齐整、匀称。
  看天浇水，深耕
      多施基肥
    风天不浇水，尤其在生长后期
  （孕穗到扬花期）更应注意。据城关福利社试验，这一点对防止倒伏也有很大关系。该社一块丰产试验田正当扬花开始，刚浇水后，即来了一场大风，结果这块地比其他地块倒伏严重。浇水过后，地下湿软，由于麦子后期已经身重，遇上风的强大压力，加上根部湿软，势必造成倒伏。
    1958年河津亩产二千斤以上的高额丰产单位的土地，一般都是耕的深，基肥施的足。耕深均在一尺以上，基肥的用量最少也在一万三千斤以上，多的还达到二万斤，都是采用分层分期施肥。小麦是深根作物，土壤疏松加上底肥充足，肥料性质又很完全，所以根系就会很好发育，也避免了由于氮肥过多，枝叶繁茂，上、下部不够平衡的现象。这一环也是防止倒伏的重要措施。
