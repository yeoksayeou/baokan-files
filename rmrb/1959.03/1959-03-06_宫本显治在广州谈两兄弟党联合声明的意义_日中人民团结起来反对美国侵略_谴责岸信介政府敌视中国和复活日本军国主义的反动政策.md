Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th: Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered a speech today to more than one thousand workers at the Guangzhou Paper Mill who gathered to welcome him.

Accompanied by Wang De, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Japanese Communist Party delegation headed by Miyamoto Kenji visited the Guangzhou Paper Mill, one of China's largest paper mills, this afternoon. More than one thousand workers from the factory gathered in the rain to warmly welcome the delegation and express their strong support for the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and for independence, peace, and democracy.

In his speech, Miyamoto Kenji first expressed his gratitude for the warm reception they had received during their visit to China. He then spoke about the great significance of the joint declaration of the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese Communist Party. He said that the joint declaration has great historical significance for strengthening the friendship between the people of Japan and China and for developing the international solidarity of the proletariat. It is a declaration of the firm struggle of the people of Japan and China against U.S. imperialism's aggression. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people, who are under the semi-occupation of U.S. imperialism and are fighting to liberate their country, will receive greater encouragement and strength from this joint declaration.

Miyamoto Kenji then condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility toward the People's Republic of China. He said: The Japanese working class and people are engaged in a broad struggle against the tyranny of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries centered on the Kishi Nobusuke government. The Japanese reactionaries, who are following U.S. imperialism, are hostile to Japan's neighbors, that is, the People's Republic of China, which has close historical ties with Japan. They oppose the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. And, most strangely, they concluded a treaty with a small group of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, claiming that the Chiang Kai-shek group represents the government of China. Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are eagerly reviving Japanese militarism, once again dragging the Japanese people onto the dangerous road of aggression.

Miyamoto Kenji said: The Vice President of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party shamelessly clamored in a magazine that Korea, Taiwan, and Japan should be put together to form a United States of Japan. Of course, the patriotic democratic forces of Japan cannot tolerate this situation.

Miyamoto Kenji described the achievements of the Japanese people in the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said that the National Grand March against war and unemployment by the Japanese people is advancing towards Tokyo. This is a grand march that firmly opposes the U.S. policy of aggression and war, and it is a blow to the Japanese reactionaries.

Miyamoto Kenji said that the great achievements you have made in the cause of socialist construction fill us in the Japanese Communist Party with immense joy. Many Japanese people are amazed by China's great leap forward in industry and agriculture. Last year, China's grain output doubled, while it took Japan sixty years to double rice production. We visited the Xijiao People's Commune in Zhengzhou and realized even more clearly that this increase in production is not a miracle, but the fruit of scientific socialism.

Miyamoto Kenji said that your great leap forward in socialist construction not only creates immense happiness for the Chinese people, but every day of your construction's leap forward is a powerful blow against the U.S. imperialists' policies of aggression and war. Miyamoto Kenji said: The people of China and Japan and the brotherly parties of the two countries will surely achieve the final and complete victory in the struggle against the common enemy. As the joint declaration of the two parties pointed out, the East Wind has now prevailed over the West Wind. The people of all countries striving for peace, national liberation, and social progress will achieve the final and complete victory, and the imperialists will fail. These are certain and beyond doubt.

Miyamoto Kenji finally pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party will unite all patriotic democratic forces and continue to fight in any environment. He said: Just as you have cleared the concessions from the territory of your motherland, we the Japanese people will also eliminate the rule and military bases of the U.S. imperialists and build our country into an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country with friendly and amicable relations with all nations. Only by firmly following this path will our working class and people achieve complete liberation through socialism.

Wang De, First Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the beginning of the welcoming rally, warmly welcoming the Japanese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Miyamoto Kenji to visit Guangzhou on behalf of all Communist Party members and the people of the city. Qi Baofu, a representative of the workers of the Guangzhou Paper Mill, also spoke at the meeting, expressing full support on behalf of all workers and the working class of Guangzhou for the just struggle of the Japanese people against atomic weapons and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said, we believe that under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people will surely achieve the final victory in the struggle for independence and peace. He also asked Comrade Miyamoto Kenji to convey the warm regards of the Chinese workers and the Chinese people to the Japanese working class and the Japanese people who are struggling hard.

After the meeting, Miyamoto Kenji and others, accompanied by Zhang Huixin, Secretary of the Guangzhou Paper Mill Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Teng Yun, Director of the factory, visited the wood grinding workshop, the paper making workshop, the cafeteria, and the club, among other places. Miyamoto Kenji expressed great concern for the workers' lives. (Attached photo)

### 宫本显治在广州谈两兄弟党联合声明的意义  日中人民团结起来反对美国侵略  谴责岸信介政府敌视中国和复活日本军国主义的反动政策

    宫本显治在广州谈两兄弟党联合声明的意义
    日中人民团结起来反对美国侵略
    谴责岸信介政府敌视中国和复活日本军国主义的反动政策
    新华社广州5日电　日本共产党总书记宫本显治今天在广州造纸厂向集会欢迎他的一千多名工人发表了演说。
    以宫本显治为首的日本共产党代表团今天下午在中共广州市委第一书记王德陪同下，来到我国最大的造纸厂之一——广州造纸厂参观。这个工厂的一千多名工人冒雨集会热烈欢迎代表团，热烈支持日本人民为反对美日反动派和争取独立、和平、民主所进行的正义斗争。
    宫本显治在讲话时，首先对他们在中国访问期间所受到的热情接待表示感谢。他接着谈到了中国共产党和日本共产党联合声明的重大意义。他说，联合声明对于加强日中两国人民的友谊和对于发展无产阶级的国际团结有着巨大的历史意义，是日中两国人民对美帝国主义的侵略进行坚决斗争的宣言，处在美帝国主义半占领状态下、为了解放自己的国家而进行斗争的日本共产党和日本人民，将从这个联合声明中得到更大的鼓舞和力量。
    宫本显治接着谴责了岸信介政府敌视中华人民共和国的政策。他说：日本的工人阶级和人民正在进行广泛的斗争，反对美帝国主义和以岸信介政府为中心的日本反动派的暴政。追随美帝国主义的日本反动派敌视日本的近邻，即同日本在历史上有密切关系的中华人民共和国。他们反对日中两国恢复邦交。而最奇怪的是他们同一小撮台湾蒋介石集团缔结和约，把蒋介石集团说成是代表中国的政府。而且，日本反动派正在急于复活日本的军国主义，再一次把日本人民拖向危险的侵略的道路。
    宫本显治说：日本自由民主党副总裁在杂志上无耻地叫嚣说，把朝鲜、台湾、日本合在一起，组成日本合众国。对这种情况，日本的爱国民主力量当然是不能忍受的。
    宫本显治叙述了日本人民在反对岸信介政府阴谋修改“警察官职务执行法”和日美“安全条约”的斗争中所取得的一定成就。他说，日本人民反对战争和失业的国民大游行正在向东京前进，这是坚决反对美国推行侵略和战争政策的大游行，是对日本反动派的一个打击。
    宫本显治说，你们在社会主义建设事业中所取得的巨大成就，使我们日本共产党特别感到巨大的喜悦。许多日本人对于中国工业、农业的大跃进都感到惊异。去年中国的粮食产量翻了番，而日本，使大米增产一倍，就花去了六十年。我们在郑州参观了西郊人民公社，更加清楚地知道这种增产并不是奇迹，而是科学的社会主义所产生的果实。
    宫本显治说，你们的社会主义建设大跃进不仅为中国人民创造了巨大的幸福，你们的建设的每一天的跃进，都是对于美帝国主义者的侵略和战争政策的有力打击。宫本显治说：中日两国人民和两国兄弟党在对共同的敌人进行的斗争中，必定获得最后的和全面的胜利。正像两党的联合声明所指出的，现在已经是东风压倒了西风。争取和平、民族解放、社会进步的各国人民，将要获得最后的全面胜利，帝国主义者将要失败，这些都是确定的，不可怀疑的。
    宫本显治最后指出，日本共产党将在任何环境下，团结一切爱国民主力量，继续进行斗争。他说：正像你们从你们祖国的领土上把租界肃清了一样，我们日本人民也将把美帝国主义者的统治和军事基地消灭掉，把我国建设成为一个同各民族具有友好、亲善关系的、独立、民主、和平、中立的国家。只有坚定走这条道路，我国的工人阶级和人民才会通过社会主义走向彻底的解放。
    中共广州市委第一书记王德在欢迎大会开始的时候讲话，他代表广州市全体共产党员和全市人民热烈欢迎以宫本显治同志为首的日本共产党代表团到广州访问。广州造纸厂工人代表齐宝富也在会上讲话，他代表全体工人和广州市的工人阶级，全力支持日本人民反对原子武器和要求废除日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。他说，我们相信，日本人民在日本共产党的领导下，在争取独立、和平的斗争中，一定能够取得最后的胜利。他并请宫本显治同志转达中国工人和中国人民对正在艰苦斗争中的日本工人阶级和日本人民的亲切慰问。
    大会结束后，宫本显治等在中共广州造纸厂委员会书记张惠钦、厂长滕云陪同下，参观了磨木车间、抄纸车间、食堂和俱乐部等。宫本显治对工人生活表示了极大的关切。（附图片）
