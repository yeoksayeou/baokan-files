    A Thousand Jin of Thought, A Thousand Jin of Wheat
    Ling Bu
    When many people's communes discuss the target of producing a thousand jin per mu of wheat this year, the members often like to say this insightful sentence: to achieve a thousand jin of wheat, first you must have a thousand jin of thought!
    Production targets seem like concrete numbers, but if they are not combined with the thoughts of the masses, these concrete numbers will become abstract empty words. The thoughts of the masses seem like an abstract thing, but when combined with production targets, they will turn into concrete thousand jin of wheat.
    Therefore, as long as the masses are fully mobilized, and after repeated discussions by the masses, everyone clearly sees the favorable conditions of their commune and production team, and has full confidence in the thousand-jin target, then thousands of people will be of one mind and speak with one voice. This is establishing a clear thousand-jin thought, and the thousand-jin target can truly take root.
    Where does this thousand-jin thought come from? It comes from soaring enthusiasm, from the crystallization of last year's experience of great agricultural harvests, and from the confidence in a greater leap forward this year. Do you say this is abstract? Not at all. Aren't the commune members calculating meticulously? Listen to what the members of the Tanshi Commune in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang, said: "Looking at it from afar, the whole country created a high-yield record of seven thousand jin per mu of wheat last year; looking at it up close, Qian Shanmen in our management area planted only five jin of seeds in one mu of rice and barley last year and harvested two hundred and forty jin. This year, the amount of seeds sown has reached thirty jin, five times more than last year. As long as we strengthen cultivation, the thousand-jin target can definitely be achieved." This passage talks about the distant and the near; it talks about the whole country and the management area; it has the logic of definitely achieving high yields, and it has the examples of personal experience. From this passage, can't we see the thousand-jin thoughts of the commune members, can't we foresee wheat stacks piled up like mountains?
    Of course, having a target requires measures. Doubled measures and effort are the key to achieving the target. But as long as the thousand-jin thought is established, it's like the marshal has entered the tent, and with a wave of the command flag, everything will be in order, and thousands of troops will advance in sequence. As long as the strategy and tactics are properly applied, victory is firmly in hand!

### 千斤思想千斤麦

    千斤思想千斤麦
    凌步
    许多人民公社在讨论今年大小麦亩产千斤的指标的时候，社员常常爱说这样一句精辟的话：要实现千斤麦，先要有千斤思想！
    生产指标看起来好像是具体的数字，可是如果不同群众的思想结合起来，这具体的也会变成一句抽象的空话；群众思想说起来好像是一个抽象的东西，可是一同生产指标结合起来，它就会变成具体的千斤麦。
    所以说，只要充分发动群众，经过群众的反复讨论，人人看清本公社、本生产队的有利条件，对千斤指标有了充分的信心，千人同心，众口一辞，这就是树立了鲜明的千斤思想，千斤指标才能真正地落脚生根。
    这千斤思想从哪里来？来自冲天干劲，来自对去年农业大丰产经验的结晶化，来自对今年更大跃进的信心。你说这是抽象的么？一点也不。社员不是都在算细账吗？请听浙江江山县坛石公社社员说：“从远处看，全国去年就创造了亩产七千斤的小麦高产纪录；从近处看，我们管理区的前山门一亩田米大麦，去年只播五斤种子，收了二百四十斤，今年播种量达到三十斤，比去年增加五倍，只要加强培育，千斤指标一定能实现。”这段话讲了远的，也讲了近的；讲了全国的，也讲了本管理区的；既有一定能高产的道理，又有亲身经历的实例。从这一段话里，不就能看到了公社社员们的千斤思想，不就能预见到堆得像山一般的麦垛了么？
    当然，有了指标，还得有措施。加倍的措施和干劲，是实现指标的关键。但只要树立了千斤思想，就好像元帅升了帐，令旗一展，一切都会井井有条，千军万马依次进发。只要战略战术运用得当，胜利是稳稳在握的！
