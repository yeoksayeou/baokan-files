A Garden Full of Spring Colors
Record of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory's Great Leap Forward in Technical Revolution Through the "Three-Way Combination"
By Our Correspondents Yang Ying and Xie Lanlin

	On a sunny spring day, we visited the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory. In the newly built large workshop, a technical revolution exhibition was being held. The venue was filled with hundreds of new products, new parts, and new machines co-created and improved by workers and technicians... truly a garden full of spring colors.
	These days, the factory is test-producing a Dongfeng brand diesel engine. Workers and technicians are jointly reviewing the design drawings of the new product, formulating process regulations, and manufacturing special machine tools themselves. The work is progressing smoothly. A process that used to take three months to complete is now completed in twenty-one days.
	Workers and engineers excitedly told us a series of stories about the "three-way combination" of workers, technicians, and leading cadres to carry out the technical revolution. Comrade Zhu Wenbin, the Party Committee Secretary, also took time out of his busy schedule to talk about his experiences over the past year. Zhu Wenbin humbly told reporters: "To be honest, we didn't immediately grasp how to carry out the technical revolution in a big way. It was clear that the simple methods of the past, where workers made rationalization proposals and technicians reviewed them behind closed doors, couldn't mobilize the masses. Later, through organizing workers and technicians to jointly study, debate, and practice, the technical revolution movement unfolded like a raging fire.”
	The newly designed oil pump—an important component of the diesel engine—had a complex structure and was difficult to process. Even a seventh-grade master craftsman could barely assemble one a day. The workers were burning with anxiety. Workers from all parts of the process, from casting and machining to assembly, put forward opinions on modifying the design of the oil pump. However, some technicians believed that this was due to the workers' lack of operational proficiency.
	The Party General Branch Committee of the workshop studied this situation and decided to hold a debate to allow everyone to present their reasons and conduct joint analysis and research.
	After three days of preparation, the debate began. Workers brought many drawings, physical objects of the oil pump, and parts. Workers, technicians, and workshop cadres sat around on wooden crates. The workers first put forward sixteen suggestions for eliminating and simplifying parts. Veteran workers Cai Guobin, Liu Bingquan, and others analyzed the performance comparison of many parts before and after the improvement one by one. After debate and research, the technicians agreed to ten suggestions for modifying the parts.
	When the debate reached lunchtime, there were still a few questions left, and the reasons on both sides were not sufficient. The workshop director, who was chairing the meeting, decided to discuss them again next time.
	The focus of the second debate was whether the auxiliary shaft could be shortened. At the meeting, a technician found theory from books to prove that shortening the auxiliary shaft was not feasible; veteran worker Xin Jifang and others presented physical objects to prove that some oil pumps had already been shortened. Of course, the persuasiveness of physical objects was stronger than that of book theory, and most technicians agreed to the change. However, individual technicians still expressed doubts, saying that the physical objects brought by the workers were only applicable to gasoline engines and might not work on diesel engines. The workers conducted an experiment on the spot, and the results proved that they could be used on diesel engines as well.
	Finally, there was one last suggestion that had not been resolved: the workers suggested eliminating the oil return hole. Engineer Wu Longge deduced from theory that without the oil return hole, the oil would be blocked by air and could not fully enter the operating parts of the entire component. Moreover, without the oil return hole, the oil could not circulate and take away the heat generated during the operation of the component. This would affect the life of the oil pump. Workshop director Shen Baolin attached great importance to this suggestion, and he went to consult other engineers. Some said that it could be cancelled. Some workers found an old oil pump without an oil return hole, further proving that it was possible to do without the oil return hole. The problem seemed to be conclusive. However, Shen Baolin did not do so. He took the old oil pump and discussed it with Wu Longge again. Wu Longge still insisted that it could not be cancelled. Finally, after testing, the results proved that Wu Longge's deduction was correct.
	After several debates, studies, and experiments, one-third of the parts of the oil pump were removed, saving raw materials, reducing man-hours, and making processing and assembly easier, ensuring the completion of the September production task. It also solved the key to the year's leap forward. Last year, the factory's diesel engine output increased by more than two times compared to the previous year, greatly exceeding the national plan.
	Engineer Wu Longge told reporters that he had only truly participated in the technical revolution through the reform of the oil pump. In the past, he rejected more of the workers' suggestions. Inspired by the reform of the oil pump, he re-examined the rationalization proposals made by the workers in the past and remembered the workers' earlier suggestion to eliminate the flywheel housing on the diesel engine. After research and experimentation with workers and cadres, the diesel engine used for agricultural drainage and irrigation now not only eliminates the flywheel housing, but also the heavy flywheel, greatly saving raw materials. He said meaningfully: "Such bold reforms cannot be found in books."
	At the exhibition, reporters witnessed that the workers and technicians of the diesel engine factory are working hard to manufacture various special machine tools, striving to achieve automatic production of cylinder heads first during the tenth anniversary of the National Day this year.
	The technical revolution movement in this factory is developing vigorously through the "three-way combination" path.

### 满园春色  记上海柴油机厂通过三结合大闹技术革命

    满园春色
    记上海柴油机厂通过三结合大闹技术革命
    本报记者　杨瑛　谢蓝麟
    一个春光明媚的日子，我们访问了上海柴油机厂。新落成的大车间里，正在举办技术革命展览会。会场里布满了工人和技术人员合作改进和创造的成百上千件新产品、新部件、新机器……，真是满园春色。
    这几天，厂里正在试制一种东风牌柴油机，工人和技术人员一起审查新产品的设计图纸，制定工艺规程，自制专用机床，工作进展很顺利。过去要三个月才能完成的工艺，现在二十一天便完成了。
    工人们、工程师们兴奋地告诉我们一连串关于工人、技术人员和领导干部三结合大闹技术革命的故事。党委书记朱文斌同志也在百忙中谈了谈一年来的体会，朱文斌谦逊地告诉记者：“老实说，大闹技术革命，究竟怎么个闹法，我们并不是一下就摸到门道的。很显然，像过去那种简单的作法，工人提合理化建议，技术人员闭门批建议，群众是发动不起来的。后来，通过组织工人和技术人员共同研究辩论和实践的方法，技术革命运动便势如破竹地展开了。”
    新设计的机油泵——柴油机上的一个重要部件，结构复杂，加工费事，一个七级老师傅一天一只也装不拢。工人们心里急得像火烧。从翻砂、加工到装配各部分的工人，纷纷提出了修改机油泵设计的意见。可是有些技术人员认为这是工人操作不熟练的缘故。
    车间党总支委员会研究了这个情况，于是决定举行一次辩论会，让大家提出理由，共同分析研究。
    经过三天准备，辩论会开始了，工人带来了许多图纸、机油泵的实物和零件。工人、技术人员、车间干部围坐在木板箱上。工人们首先提出了十六项取消和简化零件的意见。老工人蔡国斌、刘炳泉等，逐一分析了许多零件改进前后性能的比较。经过辩论研究，技术人员同意了十条修改零件的意见。
    辩论会开到吃中饭的时候，还剩下几个问题，双方的理由都不够充分，主持会议的车间主任决定下次再谈。
    第二次辩论会的争论焦点，是副轴能不能缩短。会上，技术员从书本上找出理论，证明副轴缩短不行；老工人忻纪芳等拿出了实物，证明有的机油泵已经缩短了。当然实物的说服力比书本理论强，多数技术人员都同意改。但是个别技术人员仍然表示怀疑，说工人拿来的实物只适用于汽油机，用在柴油机上不一定行。工人当场作了试验，结果证明柴油机上一样可以用。
    最后，还剩下的一条意见没有解决：工人建议取消回油孔，工程师吴隆葛根据理论推断，没有回油孔，机油将被空气阻塞，不能充分进入整个机件的运转部分，而且没有回油孔，机油便不能循环流转，把机件运转时发生的热量带走。这样，会影响到机油泵的寿命。车间主任沈保林很重视这个建议，他又去征求其他工程师的意见，有些人说可以取消。有的工人找来了一只没有回油孔的旧机油泵，进一步证明没有回油孔是可以的。问题似乎可以做结论了。但是，沈保林没有这样做。他拿了这只旧机油泵再去和吴隆葛商量，吴隆葛仍然坚持不能取消。最后经过试验，结果证明吴隆葛的推断是正确的。
    经过几次辩论、研究和试验，机油泵的零件去掉了三分之一，节省了原料，减少了工时，而且加工、装配方便，保证了9月份生产任务的完成，也解决了全年跃进的关键，去年这个厂的柴油机产量比前年增长两倍多，大大超过了国家计划。
    工程师吴隆葛告诉记者，通过改革机油泵，他才算真正地参加了技术革命。过去他对工人的建议否定的多。在改革机油泵的启示下，他从新翻出了过去工人们提的合理化建议，想起了工人早就提过的取消柴油机上飞轮壳的意见，经过和工人、干部研究试验，现在农业排灌用的柴油机，不仅取消了飞轮壳，连笨重的飞轮也取消了，大大节省了原材料。他意味深长地说：“这样大胆的改革，书本上是找不到的。”
    在展览会上，记者亲眼看到柴油机厂的工人和技术人员正在努力制造各种专用机床，争取在今年国庆十周年的时候，首先实现汽缸头自动化生产。
    这个厂的技术革命运动，通过三结合的道路，正在蓬勃地发展。
