    Safe Transportation Improves Month by Month; Each Month Redder Than the Last
    Nanjing Station Breaks Old Rules and Establishes New Chapters

    (Our newspaper's report from Nanjing on the 14th) Nanjing Railway Bureau's Nanjing Station, while mobilizing the masses to tap transportation potential, has established and improved a series of new management systems based on the needs of production. This has resulted in a new situation where both transportation and safety are improving month by month.
    Nanjing Station is the largest comprehensive passenger and freight transportation station under the Nanjing Railway Bureau, with a daily vehicle throughput of up to 3,500 vehicles. The technical operations are very heavy and complex. Over the years, in order to adapt to the transportation situation at various times, a set of rules and regulations has gradually been established. However, with the development of the situation and the improvement of workers' operating skills, some of these rules and regulations have become impractical, and some even hinder the continued improvement of transportation capacity. In the first half of last year, the station broke some outdated rules and established and improved some management systems during the mass movement to tap transportation potential, which greatly improved transportation efficiency. This year, in order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, the station has again mobilized the masses to comprehensively review the rules and regulations that have already been broken, and at the same time, to conduct a large-scale discussion on current issues such as traffic safety and punctuality. Many employees believe that rules and regulations must be broken and established in order to ensure a double leap forward in transportation and safety, and they have criticized and suggested that the failure to establish new systems in a timely manner after breaking some outdated rules in the past has affected traffic safety, punctuality, and other issues.
    The Nanjing Station Party Committee attaches great importance to the opinions of the broad masses of employees and immediately organized them to repeatedly discuss various management systems for safe production. Starting from the point of view of serving production, everyone continued to break 73 outdated rules based on the improvement of equipment, the improvement of workers' technical operating skills, and the actual needs of operations. Correspondingly, 70 new management systems were established. At the same time, more than 20 advanced experiences from the Great Leap Forward last year were sorted out and revised, and all of them were compiled into the "Station Management Rules," so that the newly established systems were closely integrated with the operation process, greatly improving transportation efficiency. For example, the "gravity switching" operation of shunting crews is an advanced shunting method that has been implemented since the early days of liberation. At that time, due to limitations such as equipment and the level of workers' operating skills, many restrictions were stipulated while implementing the "gravity switching" operation. Under the circumstances at the time, this did indeed ensure the efficiency and safety of shunting. In this discussion, employees, based on the new conditions of the station's equipment and the level of workers' operating skills, abolished and modified four restrictions that prohibited "gravity switching." This one act of breaking and establishing the system increased shunting efficiency by five to ten times. For another example, it was previously stipulated that a single locomotive should not tow more than 40 axles. This regulation was abolished during the Great Leap Forward last year. In this discussion, everyone, based on practical experience, believed that if there was no conductor observing, exceeding the axle limit too much would not guarantee traffic safety. Therefore, it was decided to establish a system that "if towing exceeds 60 axles, a conductor must be assigned to the train." In addition, clear responsibility systems were established for some new systems that had been revised last year but had not been well implemented.
    In order to ensure the rapid implementation of the newly established management systems for transportation, safety, and other aspects, the Nanjing Station Party Committee has also taken a series of measures. The first is to organize all employees to continue to deeply study the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and further improve the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of employees. Secondly, a safe production exhibition was organized, summarizing the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, examining the problems that occurred in safe production due to the failure to conscientiously implement management systems, and commending advanced units and advanced individuals in safe production. The station also regularly organizes various forms of seminars and report meetings to exchange experiences in safe production. At the same time, a regular business examination system is implemented so that all employees are familiar with the rules and regulations of their profession. In addition, the station has established a line of safe production organizations. Under the leadership of the station Party Committee, the entire station has established a safe production leading group headed by the stationmaster, and some workers who play a decisive role in safe production and who implement the system well are absorbed as members of the leading group. In each production team, a safe production inspector is set up to be responsible for safe production inspection work.
    Because all work types and all production teams conscientiously implement various management systems, a new atmosphere of comprehensive Great Leap Forward has emerged in Nanjing Station, with transportation and safety improving month by month, and the next month being redder than the previous month. In terms of transportation, all production targets have been fully completed or overfulfilled. For example, the turnaround time of vehicles at the station was 4.2 hours in December, shortened to 3.9 hours in January, and further shortened to 3.3 hours in February. The stay time for each freight operation was 6.9 hours in December, shortened to 5.5 hours in January, and further shortened to 5.3 hours in February. The average load per vehicle was 31.7 tons in December, increased to 31.8 tons in January, and further increased to 41.3 tons in February. In addition, technical indicators and transportation tasks such as the punctuality rate of passenger and freight trains, the number of loading and unloading vehicles, and the tonnage of goods dispatched have also been completed or overfulfilled. In terms of safety, the accident rate has been greatly reduced. In January, Nanjing Station won the bureau's red flag with excellent safety results.

### 安全运输月月红　一月更比一月红  南京车站破陈规立新章

    安全运输月月红　一月更比一月红
    南京车站破陈规立新章
    本报南京14日电　南京铁路局南京车站，在发动群众挖掘运输潜力的同时，从生产需要出发，建立和健全了一系列新的管理制度，在运输和安全两方面出现了一月比一月好的新局面。
    南京车站是南京铁路局所属最大的客货运输综合车站，每日车辆吞吐量最高达三千五百辆之多，技术作业十分繁重复杂。多年来为了适应各个时期的运输情况，逐渐建立了一套规章制度。但是，随着形势的发展和工人操作技术水平的提高，有些规章制度已经不切合实际，有的甚至妨碍运输能力的继续提高。去年上半年，这个车站在挖掘运输潜力的群众运动中，曾经破除了一些陈旧规章，建立和健全了一些管理制度，大大提高了运输效率。今年，为了实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，这个车站又发动群众对已经破除的规章制度进行全面复查，同时对当前行车安全和正点等问题进行大鸣大放。许多职工认为，规章制度要有破有立，才能保证运输和安全双跃进，并对过去破除一些陈规以后没有及时建立新的制度，以致影响行车安全、正点等问题，提出了批评和建议。
    南京车站党委十分重视广大职工的意见，立即组织他们对安全生产各项管理制度反复进行讨论。大家从为生产服务的观点出发，根据设备的改进、工人们技术操作水平的提高和作业的实际需要等情况，继续破除了七十三种陈规，相应地建立了七十种新的管理制度；同时整理修订了去年大跃进中的二十多种先进经验，把它们全部编进了“车站管理细则”，使新建立的制度和作业过程紧密地结合起来，大大提高了运输效率。如调车组的“溜放”作业，是解放初期就实行的先进调车法。当时，因为设备和工人操作技术水平等条件的限制，在实行“溜放”作业的同时，又规定了许多限制的条件。这在当时的情况下，确实保证了调车的效率和安全。在这次讨论中，职工们根据本站的设备条件和工人操作技术水平等新的情况，破除和修改了其中四条不准“溜放”的限制。单是这一制度的破与立，就使调车效率增加到五到十倍。再如，过去曾规定，单机车牵带车辆不得超过四十轴。这项规定在去年大跃进中被废除了。在这次讨论中，大家根据实践的经验，认为如果没有车长了望，过多地超轴就不能保证行车安全。因此，决定建立“牵带超过六十轴要开车次派车长”的制度。此外，对去年有些已经修订了的新制度而没能很好执行的，也作出了健全责任制的规定。
    为了保证新立的运输、安全等各项管理制度的迅速贯彻，南京车站党委又采取了一系列的措施。首先是组织全体职工继续深入学习党的八届六中全会决议，进一步提高广大职工的政治思想觉悟。其次，组织了一个安全生产展览会，总结了1958年大跃进的巨大成绩，检查了由于没有认真贯彻执行管理制度而在安全生产上发生的问题，同时表扬了安全生产先进单位和先进人物。这个车站还经常组织各种形式的座谈会和报告会等，交流安全生产的经验。同时执行定期业务考试制度，使全体职工都熟悉本行的规章制度，此外，这个车站又建立了一条线的安全生产组织。在车站党委的领导下，全站建立了以站长为首的安全生产领导小组，将一部分对安全生产起决定作用的工种中执行制度较好的工人，吸收为领导小组组员。在各个生产小组，设立一个安全生产检查员，负责安全生产检查工作。
    由于各个工种，各个生产小组都认真贯彻了各项管理制度，南京车站就出现了运输和安全月月红、下月比上月更红的全面大跃进的新气象。在运输方面，各项生产指标都全面完成或超额完成。如车辆在站中转时间，12月份为四点二小时，1月份缩短为三点九小时，2月份又进一步缩短为三点三小时。一次货物作业停留时间，12月份为六点九小时，1月份缩短为五点五小时，2月份又进一步缩短为五点三小时。每车平均载重量，12月份为三十一点七吨，1月份提高为三十一点八吨，2月份又提高为四十一点三吨。此外，客车、货车的正点率，装、卸车数，货物发送吨数等技术指标和运输任务，也都完成或超额完成。在安全方面，事故率大大降低。1月份南京车站以优良的安全成绩夺得了全局红旗。
