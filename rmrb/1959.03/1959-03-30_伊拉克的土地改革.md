    Land Reform in Iraq
    The Iraqi Supreme Committee for Land Reform recently decided to lease state-owned land in the Kut province directly to farmers. This is part of the land reform plan that the Iraqi government has decided to implement widely.
    Iraq is an agricultural country, with 80% of the population engaged in agriculture. The total cultivated land area in the country is 22 million dunums (one dunum equals 3.75 mu), but more than two-thirds of the cultivated land belongs to one thousand large landowners, among whom 104 landowners each own more than 20,000 to 1 million dunums of cultivated land. The vast majority of farmers have no or very little land, and tenant farmers generally have to pay more than two-thirds of their harvest as rent. Therefore, the living standards of the vast majority of farmers are very low.
    Shortly after the victory of the July 1958 revolution, the government of the Republic of Iraq announced that it would implement land reform; the provisional constitution also stipulated restrictions on the amount of land owned by landowners. In early August of last year, the Land Reform Committee, headed by the Minister of Agriculture, was established. Before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, the government stipulated that landowners and farmers should share the harvest equally in order to reduce the burden on farmers. It also abolished the feudal courts privately set up by large feudal landowners—chieftains, thereby打击[dǎjī - to strike; to hit; to attack]打击[dǎjī - to strike; to hit; to attack] feudal forces.
    The Land Reform Law was promulgated on September 30, 1958. According to this decree, the land owned by individuals shall not exceed 1,000 dunums in areas with irrigation and drainage facilities, and up to 2,000 dunums in areas without irrigation and drainage facilities. Land exceeding the limit will be requisitioned within five years, but with compensation; the compensation will be paid off within twenty years. The state will distribute the requisitioned land and state-owned land to farmers. In areas with irrigation and drainage facilities, each farmer household can receive 30 to 60 dunums, and in areas without irrigation and drainage, 60 to 120 dunums. The price of land distributed to farmers will be determined according to land conditions, and farmers will pay it off within twenty years. The Land Reform Law also stipulates that cooperatives will be organized to help new landowners cultivate.
    Shortly after the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, the government of the Republic of Iraq established the Supreme Committee for Land Reform and allocated one million dinars (Iraqi currency) to implement the Land Reform Law. In November 1958, the Land Reform Committee ordered landowners to declare their land area within two or three months, and in December, it announced the list of landowners whose land would be requisitioned in two successive batches. The Iraqi Minister of Agriculture once said that the purpose of Iraq's land reform is to ensure that each farmer household with an average of five people has an annual income of 350 dinars.
    The vast number of farmers in Iraq warmly welcome and support the government's Land Reform Law. At the beginning of this year, 50,000 farmers in the Diwaniyah province and farmer representatives from other provinces held a meeting to support the Land Reform Law. The resolution of the meeting expressed the determination to crush those who attempt to obstruct the implementation of the Land Reform Law.

    伊拉克的土地改革
    伊拉克土地改革最高委员会最近决定把库特省的国有土地直接出租给农民。这是伊拉克政府决定广泛实行的土地改革计划的一部分。
    伊拉克是农业国，80％的人口从事农业。全国耕地总面积有二千二百万杜努姆（一杜努姆等于三点七五市亩），但是三分之二以上的耕地是属于一千个大地主的，其中一百零四个地主各拥有耕地二万到一百万杜努姆以上。绝大多数农民则没有或很少有土地，佃农一般要把三分之二以上的收成交纳地租。所以绝大多数农民的生活水平非常低下。
    1958年7月革命胜利后不久，伊拉克共和国政府就宣布要实行土地改革；临时宪法也规定限制地主土地额。去年8月初成立了以农业部长为首的土地改革委员会，在土地改革法颁布以前，政府规定地主和农民平分收成，以减少农民负担，还取消了封建大地主——酋长私设的法庭，从而打击了封建势力。
    1958年9月30日，土地改革法颁布了。根据这个法令，个人所有的土地，在有排灌设施的地区不得超过一千杜努姆，在没有排灌设施的地区可达二千杜努姆。超过限额的土地将在五年内予以征收，但有补偿；补偿款项于二十年内还清。国家则将征收的土地和国有土地分给农民，在有排灌设施的地区，每个农户可分到三十到六十杜努姆，无排灌地区可分到六十到一百二十杜努姆。分给农民的土地价格将根据土地条件确定，农民将在二十年内偿清。土地改革法还规定将组织合作社以帮助新的土地所有者耕种。
    土地改革法颁布不久，伊拉克共和国政府又成立了土地改革最高委员会，并拨款一百万第纳尔（伊币名）来执行土地改革法。1958年11月，土地改革委员会限令土地所有者在两三月内申报土地面积，在12月并先后两次公布了要予以征收土地的地主名单。伊拉克共和国农业部长曾说过，伊拉克土地改革的目的是要保证平均有五口人的每个农户每年三百五十第纳尔的收入。
    伊拉克广大农民热烈欢迎和支持政府的土地改革法。今年年初，迪旺尼亚省的五万个农民和来自其他各省的农民代表举行集会，支持土地改革法，大会的决议表示要粉碎那些企图阻挠实行土地改革法的人。
