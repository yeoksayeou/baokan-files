The season for early rice sowing and transplanting has arrived. After solving the problem of cultivating strong seedlings, the question of how to improve transplanting speed and quality has been put on the agenda.

How to solve this problem? In addition to vigorously reforming transplanting tools in Zhejiang Province, fast rice transplanting skill competitions are being held in various places. This is a good way. Through the competition, people can not only see the new developments in the techniques of last year's transplanting experts, but also discover more new experts cultivated in the production process; through the competition, people can not only compare the characteristics of the various experts, but also summarize and improve their technical experience to make it more complete and systematic; through the competition, not only can the experts learn from each other, but also more people can be encouraged and educated, which creates conditions for further carrying out a mass movement for rapid rice transplanting. Therefore, holding a rice transplanting skill competition will inevitably make the experts more skillful as they compare, and the masses more skillful as they learn. This plays an important role in ensuring the timely completion of early rice dense planting.

    越比越巧
    早稻播种插秧的季节已经来到了。在解决了培育壮秧的问题之后，如何提高插秧速度和质量的问题又被提到议事日程上来了。
    怎样解决这个问题？浙江省除了大力改革插秧工具，各地都在召开快速插秧能手比赛大会。这是一个好办法。通过比赛，人们不仅可以看到去年的插秧能手在技术上的新发展，而且能发现更多的在生产过程中培养出来的新的能手；通过比赛，人们不仅可以互相比较各个能手之间的特点，而且可以把他们的技术经验加以总结和提高，使它更加完整和系统化；通过比赛，不仅可以使能手之间互相学习，而且能使更多的群众受到鼓舞和教育，这就为进一步开展群众性的快速插秧运动创造了条件。因此，召开插秧能手比巧大会，必然使能手越比越巧，群众越学越巧。这对保证适时完成早稻密植有重要作用。
