Huainan, March 2nd (by our correspondent) — Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province is taking various measures to extract coal against time, contributing to the national goal of producing 380 million tons of coal annually, striving to increase coal production from 8.15 million tons last year to 14 million tons this year, an increase of 72% compared to last year. Among this, approximately 7 million tons will be suitable for coking coal.

Huainan Coal Mine's planned output for this year exceeds the total coal production of the mine in the twenty years before liberation by more than 4.2 million tons, surpassing the designed production capacity of existing mines by nearly double. To ensure the realization of this year's great leap forward, Huainan Coal Mine will first maximize the potential of existing mines, increasing coal production from 8.15 million tons last year to 11.5 million tons from the existing seven production mines. At the same time, Huainan Coal Mine is also accelerating the construction of new mines. The new mines and small coal pits that will be put into operation this year will produce 2.5 million tons of coal within the year.

Reforming coal mining methods and improving coal mining efficiency, thereby increasing the output per unit area of coal mining faces, is an important way to increase the production capacity of existing mines. This year, Huainan Coal Mine plans to further promote advanced coal mining methods such as the "shield support coal mining method," the "multi-cycle operation coal mining method," and "hydraulic coal mining." The common features of these coal mining methods are: high output, high efficiency, low timber consumption, and safe production. For example, after adopting the "shield support coal mining method," the average coal mining efficiency of the coal mining face increased from the original 4.1833 tons to 6.6 tons. At present, although the "hydraulic coal mining" production at this mine is not yet normal, the average efficiency of the coal mining face has increased by approximately one time compared to general "dry mining."

In order to rapidly increase the coal mine's new production capacity, Huainan Coal Mine will not only focus on the construction of large-scale mines this year but also build a number of small coal pits. This year, the mine plans to newly build and continue the construction of a total of seven pairs of large and medium-sized mines, with a designed capacity of 3.75 million tons. Among them, five mines will be put into operation successively within this year. Currently, the construction of new mines is being accelerated. Of the twenty-nine pairs of small coal pits planned to be built this year, twenty-six pairs have already started construction. These twenty-nine pairs of small coal pits will be put into operation successively before May of this year, with construction time generally only about three months. These small coal pits plan to produce 1.5 million tons of coal within the year.

On the basis of mobilizing the masses of workers to reform coal mining technology, Huainan Coal Mine has also rationally adjusted the labor organization, solving the problem of labor shortage. Originally, coal mining and tunneling workers only accounted for 45% of the total number of workers in the mine, while auxiliary production workers accounted for 55%. After this adjustment, the proportion of direct production workers will increase to 55%, and auxiliary production workers will decrease to 45%. In this way, 1,709 people can be transferred from auxiliary workers to supplement coal mining and tunneling production. At the same time, some business institutions that could be merged were merged, and concurrent operations were promoted.

Currently, the vast number of workers at Huainan Coal Mine are carrying out enthusiastic labor emulation drives, vigorously engaging in technological revolution, and ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's leap forward plan. The workers of the No. 3 mine of Liyingzi displayed soaring enthusiasm, overfulfilling the January coal production plan by 5,522 tons, an increase of 8.2% compared to the highest output in December last year. The workers of the New Zhuangzi Coal Mine basic construction youth red flag team completed the first quarter's mine development plan in thirty-eight days. Now, the workers of this team have put forward new goals, guaranteeing to complete the state plan of tunneling 1,080 meters throughout the year before June. Since the beginning of this year, the workers of New Zhuangzi Coal Mine have carried out 446 technical reforms, greatly improving production efficiency. For example, the electric hoist created by the electromechanical section of this mine increased the efficiency of the electric motor ball plate by more than 900 times. Only five technical reforms in Xiejiagji No. 1 Mine can save more than 30 people.

### 订出跃进指标　开展劳动竞赛  淮南矿决心为“三亿八”立功

    订出跃进指标　开展劳动竞赛
    淮南矿决心为“三亿八”立功
    本报合肥2日电　安徽省淮南煤矿采取各种措施，向时间要煤，为全国年产三亿八千万吨煤炭立功，争取今年煤炭产量由去年的八百一十五万吨提高到一千四百万吨，比去年增长72％。其中将有七百万吨左右可以用作炼焦煤。
    淮南煤矿今年的计划产量，比解放前这个矿二十多年产煤量的总和还多四百二十多万吨，超过现有矿井设计生产能力将近一倍。为了保证实现今年的大跃进，淮南煤矿首先大挖现有矿井的潜力，现有七个生产矿井的产煤量，将由去年的八百一十五万吨提高到一千一百五十万吨。同时，淮南煤矿还抓紧新井建设工程。今年要陆续投入生产的新井和小煤窑年内将生产煤炭二百五十万吨。
    改革采煤方法，提高采煤生产效率，从而增加采煤工作面的单位面积产量，是提高现有矿井生产能力的重要途径。淮南煤矿今年计划进一步推广的先进采煤法有：“掩护支架采煤法”、“多循环作业采煤法”和“水力采煤”。这几种采煤方法的共同特点是：产量大，效率高，坑木消耗少，生产安全。如采用“掩护支架采煤法”以后，采煤工作面的平均采煤效率，就由原来的四点一八三三吨提高到六点六吨。目前，这个矿“水力采煤”生产虽然还不够正常，但采煤工作面的平均效率已比一般“旱采”提高约一倍。
    为了迅速增加煤矿新的生产能力，淮南煤矿今年在大抓大型矿井建设的同时，还要建设一批小煤窑。这个矿今年计划新建和续建的大型、中型矿井共七对，矿井的设计能力是三百七十五万吨。其中，有五个矿井将在今年内陆续投入生产。目前，新井建设工程正在加紧进行。今年计划兴建的二十九对小煤窑，目前已有二十六对动工建设。这二十九对小煤窑，将在今年5月份以前陆续投入生产，建设时间一般都只有三个月左右。这些小煤窑年内计划生产一百五十万吨煤炭。
    淮南煤矿还在发动职工群众改革采煤技术的基础上，合理地调整了劳动组织，解决了劳力不足的问题。原来采煤和掘进工人只占全矿工人总数的45％，而辅助生产工人却占了55％；经过这次调整以后，直接生产工人的比例将增加到55％，辅助生产工人降到45％。这样，就可以由辅助工人中抽调出一千七百零九人，充实到采煤和掘进生产中去。同时，又合并了一些可以合并的业务机构，推行兼职作业。
    目前，淮南煤矿的广大职工开展了热烈的劳动竞赛，大搞技术革命，保证完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划。李郢孜三号井的职工发挥了冲天的干劲，超额五千五百二十二吨完成了1月份的产煤计划，比去年产量最高的12月份提高了8.2％。新庄孜煤矿基本建设青年红旗队的工人，用三十八天就完成了第一季度的矿井开拓计划。现在，这个队的工人又提出了新的奋斗目标，保证在6月以前完成全年掘进一千零八十公尺的国家计划。新庄孜煤矿的职工今年以来，已进行了四百四十六项技术改革，大大提高了生产效率。如这个矿机电科创造的电扒子，使电动机弹子盘提高工效九百多倍。谢家集一矿仅五项技术改革，就可以节省三十多人。
