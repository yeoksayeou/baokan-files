    The play on the stage is now at the scene where Guan Hanqing, the great Yuan Dynasty playwright of our country five hundred years ago, meets his confidante Zhu Lianxiu in prison. This famous singer and actress of Dadu, who was praised for her excellence in performing zaju at the time, is once again deeply and passionately singing a new tune "Butterfly Double Flying" written by Guan Hanqing in prison. This song, which depicts their life, heavily touches the hearts of the audience.

    The actress playing Zhu Lianxiu has a golden bell-like voice. She sings with an exciting tone, so melodious and touching, full of emotion. One doesn't know how much emotion and anger is hidden in her heart, as she pours out all her passion. Guan Hanqing, who is appreciating it from the side, is deeply intoxicated in this touching realm. He expresses his feelings through dance as he sings along. When the song reaches the line "Our hair may not be the same color, but our hearts are equally warm; we may not share the same bed in life, but we will share the same grave in death. When azaleas bloom all over the land next year, watch the Hanqing and Fourth Sister butterflies fluttering in the wind," Zhu Lianxiu, whose heart is bursting with the sparks of love, is both happy and worried. She is happy that the "double flying butterflies" she has been waiting for day and night are finally spoken by Guan Hanqing himself; she is worried about how such a scene can be realized. This ever-changing complex mood is powerfully portrayed through the actress's increasingly high-pitched singing and her vigorous walk in a circle from a static singing posture. Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu's unyielding spirit, and the lofty friendship between the two, through this song and dance "Butterfly Double Flying," bring the audience to a state of selflessness. I don't know when, but the theater became so quiet, and the annoying noise and clutter at the beginning disappeared without a trace. The magic of art exerts its irresistible power here.

      The lingering sound of "May we always be together, let's not say goodbye," is still in my ears, the purple-red curtain suddenly falls, and the electric lights come on, illuminating the theater. The audience, awakened from their contemplation, bursts into enthusiastic applause. "This is the Zhu Lianxiu and Guan Hanqing I imagined!" my companion next to me said excitedly with an uncontrollable emotion.

    This is "Guan Hanqing" performed on the Cantonese opera stage. I have seen this play for more than half a month, but the moving images of Zhu Lianxiu and Guan Hanqing carefully shaped by the talented tragic actress Hong Xiannv and the experienced veteran artist Ma Shizeng, appear in my mind from time to time, and I cannot forget them for a long time. The excellent drama describing the northern cold plum blossoms has bloomed a wonderful flower in the South.

    That very night, after the play, an impatient mood drove me to the backstage to listen to the two actors talk about their creative insights while they were changing costumes.

    "I love people like Zhu Lianxiu. When I first read Comrade Tian Han's script in one breath, I really longed for the opportunity to play this role," said Comrade Hong Xiannv excitedly. After thinking for a while, she continued, "From Zhu Lianxiu, I saw the beautiful qualities left on her by Dou E, Zhao Pan'er, Yan Yan… these respectable and lovable women she has played. These kind Chinese women, in the era of feudal rule, suffered all kinds of torture and hid their pain in their hearts, but they dared to rise up and resist. Zhu Lianxiu is considered an outstanding one among them. Don't look down on her as a courtesan, she has more insight and talent than ordinary courtesans. She is not only beautiful, dignified, knowledgeable and reasonable, but also a truly righteous person."

    Speaking of this, Comrade Ma Shizeng, who had finished dressing, came over. Comrade Hong Xiannv asked him to continue, apologizing that she had to change her clothes. Comrade Ma Shizeng modestly stated that the play produced by the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe has only been performed intermittently for more than thirty shows, and is very immature. He is still exploring and improving it. He himself has studied some materials about Guan Hanqing. This is a passionate literati. At that time, Guan Hanqing saw the rulers' licentiousness and shamelessness, and also deeply knew the suffering of the people. He had to use his pen to outline the ugly faces of the powerful, and at the same time enthusiastically sing the praises of the working people's beautiful character and spirit of resistance. He believes that Guan Hanqing in this play truly and thoroughly exhausted the art of expressing joy, anger, sorrow, and mockery.

    It was nearly midnight, and the backstage staff urged us to leave as if they were urging the actors to go on stage. I had no choice but to hurriedly say my last request: "The audience in the capital will love the Cantonese opera 'Guan Hanqing' as much as I do, please come and perform as soon as possible!"

    北地寒梅南国开
    朱树兰
    舞台上的戏，正演到五百年前我国元代大戏剧家关汉卿和他的风尘知己朱廉秀在狱中相会。这位当时被誉为擅演杂剧的大都名歌妓，又一次深情地抒唱着关汉卿在狱中写成的一支新曲“蝶双飞”。这支为他们二人一生写照的曲子，沉重地拨动着观众的心弦。
    那扮朱廉秀的演员，有一副金铃般的歌喉，她用一种激动人心的腔调，唱得那么婉转动听，感情奔放，不知道她心中蕴藏了多少感慨，多少愤怒，把一腔热情尽情地倾泻出来了。在一旁欣赏的关汉卿，深深地沉醉在这感人的境界中，他随着歌唱，借舞蹈抒发自己的情怀。曲子唱到“俺与你发不同青心同热，生不同床死同穴，待来年遍地杜鹃花，看风前汉卿四姐双飞蝶。”被爱情的火花燃烧得心花怒放的朱廉秀又是喜又是忧，喜的是朝夕盼望的“双飞蝶”，终于由关汉卿亲口说出来了；忧的是此等情景，又怎能实现？这变化万千的复杂心情，从演员越来越高吭的歌声，和从静唱的姿态急遽地走了一个圆场中有力地刻划出来。关汉卿和朱廉秀的坚贞不屈，他们二人之间的崇高情谊，通过这一曲载歌载舞的“蝶双飞”，把观众带到了忘我的境界。不晓得从什么时候开始，剧场里变得这样安静，开场时令人不耐的纷扰和杂乱声消失得无影无踪。艺术的魔力在这里施展了它不可抗拒的力量。
      “相永好，不言别。”的余音犹在耳边，紫红色的帷幕腾地放落下来，电灯一亮，照得剧场通明，从沉思中清醒过来的观众席上发出一阵热烈的掌声。“这才是我想像中的朱廉秀和关汉卿！”我邻座的同伴用一种抑制不住的情绪兴奋地说。
    这是粤剧舞台上演出的“关汉卿”。我看这出戏已经有半个多月了，但是，天才的悲剧演员红线女和有经验的前辈艺人马师曾精心塑造的朱廉秀和关汉卿的动人形象，不时出现在我的眼前，久久不能忘怀。描写北地寒梅的优秀话剧在南国放出了奇葩。
    就是那天晚上，戏散了，急不可待的心情驱使我去到后台，趁下装的片刻，听两位演员谈谈他们的剧作心得。
    “我爱朱廉秀这样的人。当我第一次，一口气读完田汉同志这个剧本的时候，真是渴望能有机会扮演这个角色。”红线女同志兴奋地这样说。思索了一下，她接着又说：“从朱廉秀的身上，我看到了她演过的窦娥、赵盼儿、燕燕……这些可敬爱的女性在她身上留下的美好品质。这些善良的中国妇女，在封建统治的年代，受尽折磨，心藏苦痛，她们却敢于起来反抗，朱廉秀算是她们中间出色的一个。别看她是一个歌妓，却比一般歌妓有见识，有才华。她不只是美丽端庄、知书达理，也是真正讲义气的人。”
    谈到这里，马师曾同志下好装过来了，红线女同志请他继续说下去，她抱歉自己也要换衣服了。马师曾同志谦虚地表示，广东粤剧院排的这出戏，断断续续才演了三十多场，很不成熟，如今还在摸索改进。他自己研究过一些关于关汉卿的资料。这是一个满怀热情的文人，在当时，关汉卿一面看到统治者的荒淫无耻，又深知人民的疾苦，他不能不用自己的笔来勾划权贵们的丑恶嘴脸，同时也热烈地歌颂劳动人民美好的品德和反抗精神。他认为这出戏里的关汉卿真是淋漓尽致地用尽了喜笑怒骂的手笔。
    近午夜了，后台的管理人员像催演员上场一样催我们离去。我只好匆忙的说出了最后一个要求：“首都的观众会和我一样爱上粤剧的
  ‘关汉卿’，请你们早点来演出吧！”
