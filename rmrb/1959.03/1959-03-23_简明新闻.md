	Universal Mud Collector
	Wang Zhenjia's well-digging team from the Mafeng People's Commune in Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, recently created a "universal mud collector" for digging wells in mountainous areas, increasing the speed of digging deep wells in mountainous areas by fourteen times. This universal mud collector is designed and manufactured according to the characteristics of thin soil layers, large amounts of underground gravel, and thick cobblestone layers in mountainous areas. It is very convenient to use. When digging and expanding the well, simply hang the "universal mud collector" a little more than one meter below the well-digging cone, and it can collect all the mud, sand, and cobblestones that fall off during the well-digging process. After it is full, it is lifted up together with the well-digging cone. This greatly increases the speed of well drilling.

	Ceramic Rail Fertilization
	The Ziwu People's Commune in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan has successfully fired ceramic rails. At present, the first batch of ceramic rails has been laid in the commune's fields. Fertilizer carts shuttle back and forth on the rails, increasing efficiency by seventeen times compared to carrying by people in the past. These ceramic rails were fired by workers in the commune's pottery factory under the specific leadership of the Party committee. The method is the same as firing other pottery. It saves money and is strong. According to tests, a fertilizer cart weighing 500 kilograms can be pushed back and forth on it without causing any damage to the ceramic rail.

    万能接泥器
    辽宁海城县马风人民公社王振甲打井小组最近创制了一种山地打井用的“万能接泥器”，使山地打深井速度提高十四倍。这种万能接泥器是根据山区土层薄、地下砂砾大、卵石层厚的特点设计制造的。它使用起来很方便，在打井扩眼时，只要把“万能接泥器”吊在打井锥下面一公尺多的地方，就可以把打井时脱落的泥砂、卵石全部接住，装满后便随打井锥一起提上来。这样就大大提高了凿井速度。
    陶轨运肥
    云南楚雄彝族自治州子午人民公社烧制陶器轨道成功。目前，公社田野上已铺设起第一批陶轨，运肥斗车在轨道上往来如梭，效率比过去人背肩挑提高十七倍。这种陶轨是公社里陶器厂的工人在党委具体领导下烧制出来的。方法与烧制其他陶器一样。它省钱又坚固，据试验，重达五百公斤的肥料斗车在上面来回推运，陶轨丝毫没有受到损折。
