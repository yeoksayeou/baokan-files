Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 9th - Beirut's "News Weekly" published a commentary on the 8th regarding Yugoslav President Tito's recent visits to some Asian and African countries, stating that "his duty is to destroy the friendship between the Soviet Union and the people of the countries he visits."

The commentary stated that Arabs and Lebanese are very proud of their friendship with the Soviet Union, which was, is, and will continue to be a source of their strength. Tito and his friends in the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party cannot destroy the friendship between the Soviet people and the Arab people.

The commentary said, "In his speech in Syria, Tito told his listeners, 'You can trust Yugoslavia'; there is no doubt that Tito also said the same thing to the Indonesians and Ceylonese, etc."

The commentary continued, "A person with a high fever cannot help a healthier person. The rulers of Yugoslavia believe that Yugoslavia is such a country, one that is ruled by the working class and has established socialism under the leadership of the 'League of Communists.' However, we see it begging for loans here and there, from the United States and Britain, in order to stand on its own feet and fight against the widespread poverty in Yugoslavia." The commentary stated, "The fact that typhus is prevalent in central Yugoslavia illustrates the widespread poverty in that place, because typhus accompanies poverty."

    黎巴嫩“消息周报”发表评论
    铁托存心破坏苏联和亚非国家友谊
    新华社贝鲁特9日电　贝鲁特“消息周报”在8日就南斯拉夫总统铁托最近在一些亚非国家的访问发表评论说，“他的职责是破坏苏联同他所访问的国家的人民之间的友谊”。
    评论说，阿拉伯人和黎巴嫩人对他们与苏联的友谊感到非常骄傲，这种友谊过去是，而且将来也是他们的力量的泉源。铁托和他的朋友阿拉伯复兴社会党人都不能破坏苏联人和阿拉伯人之间的友谊。
    评论说：“铁托在叙利亚发表的演说中对听众们说，‘你们可以信赖南斯拉夫’；毫无疑问，铁托也曾经对印度尼西亚人和锡兰人等等说过同样的话。”
    评论接着说，“一个发高烧的病人不能帮助一个比较健康的人。南斯拉夫的统治者认为，南斯拉夫是这样一个国家，就是一个由工人阶级统治的和在‘共产主义者联盟’的领导下已经建立了社会主义的国家。但是，我们却看到它向这里和那里、向美国和英国乞求贷款，以便立住脚来与南斯拉夫普遍存在的贫困斗争。”评论说，“斑疹伤寒在南斯拉夫中部流行这一事实，说明在那个地方普遍地贫困，因为斑疹伤寒是伴随着贫困而来的”。
