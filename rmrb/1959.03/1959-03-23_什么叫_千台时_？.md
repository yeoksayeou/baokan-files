What is "Thousand Machine-Hours"?

"Machine-hours" is a form of calculating output for machine tools. According to general quotas, each machine tool operated by three people in three shifts can complete 570 to 600 labor-hour quotas per month. "Thousand Machine-Hours" means that each machine tool operated by three people in three shifts must complete 1,000 labor-hour quotas per month. The "Thousand Machine-Hours" movement is by no means about increasing working hours, because even if a machine tool operates non-stop around the clock for the entire month (calculated as 30 days), it can only have 720 hours of working time. Therefore, to achieve a thousand machine-hours or even higher, it is necessary to strengthen production management, improve labor organization, carry out technical revolution, strengthen cooperation, and fully exploit the potential of labor and equipment. This is a collectivist red flag emulation movement, and a good way for the machinery industry to increase output per unit area.

    什么叫“千台时”？
      “台时”是机床计算产量的一种形式。按照一般定额，每台机床三个人开三班，一个月可以做五百七十到六百工时定额的活。“千台时”就是指每台机床三个人开三班一月要做一千工时定额的活。“千台时”运动绝不是增加工作时间，因为一台机床即使全月（按三十天计算）昼夜不停地运转，也只能有七百二十小时的工作时间。所以要达到千台时以至更高的台时，就必须加强生产管理，改善劳动组织，开展技术革命，加强协作，充分发挥劳动力和设备的潜力等。这是一种集体主义的红旗竞赛运动，是机械工业提高单位面积产量的一种好形式。
