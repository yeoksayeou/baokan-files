    Good News Nears
    Xu Feixi
    Happily Composed After Returning to the Country

    After ten years of absence, I return, delighted to see the embroidered landscapes, meeting relatives everywhere, this is my home. A hundred flowers bloom in dazzling crimson, a myriad of phenomena present a vibrant spirit, the motherland's bugle sounds heroic and strong, in the red of the early sun.

    好事近
    徐飞锡
    归国后喜赋
    念载复归来，喜见锦团山水，到处亲人相遇，是吾家乡里。百花齐放灿朱霞，万象呈朝气，祖国角声雄壮，在初阳红里。
