Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 23rd: Approximately 180,000 workers from fourteen major coal mining companies in Japan, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, began an indefinite strike this morning, launching the largest unified struggle since the autumn of 1952.

    The coal miners' general strike is part of the spring struggle currently being waged by workers throughout Japan. Prior to this, the coal miners held numerous strikes, insisting on a monthly wage increase of 2,000 yen and opposing the attempt by capitalists at Mitsui Mining Company to lay off 6,000 workers.

    Negotiations held between the Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union and the Japan Coal Association broke down on the 22nd. This is because the capitalists not only refused to accept the workers' wage increase demands, but also wanted to effectively reduce workers' wages in the name of improving work efficiency.

    日本十八万矿工举行大罢工
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本三井、三菱、住友等十四家大煤矿公司的共约十八万工人从今天早晨开始一齐举行不定期罢工，展开了自从1952年秋天以来规模最大的统一斗争。
    煤矿工人的这次大罢工是日本全国工人正在进行的春季斗争的一个部分。煤矿工人在这以前举行了多次罢工，坚持要求每月增加工资两千日元，并反对三井矿山公司的资本家企图解雇六千名工人。
    日本煤矿工会和日本煤炭协会举行的谈判在22日已经破裂。因为，资本家们不仅不接受工人的增加工资的要求，反而想以提高工作效率的名义，来实际上降低工人工资。
