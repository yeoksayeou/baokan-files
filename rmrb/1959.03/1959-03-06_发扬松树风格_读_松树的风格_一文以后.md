    Promoting the Pine Tree Style
    ——After Reading "The Pine Tree's Style"
    Wen Xiuhua

    "The Pine Tree's Style" is a very good essay, a good article that inspires people to be high-spirited and enthusiastic. I read it three times and loved it. Essays generally refer to short articles that express feelings and emotions in an unconstrained and impromptu manner. Many are published in newspapers, but some have too much of an intellectual flavor, some are no different from lengthy theoretical articles, and some are too miscellaneous, lacking grandeur, and fail to give people a strong sense of inspiration after reading.

    "The key to opening other people's hearts is the author's own heart." Comrade Tao Zhu, in his article "The Pine Tree's Style," openly revealed his crystal-clear heart to the reader, expressing his noble sentiments, and leading us into a sublime inner realm.

    Comrade Tao Zhu used Mr. Lu Xun's saying, "I eat grass and squeeze out milk and blood," to describe the style of the pine tree. In my opinion, this is also a description of the style of our revolutionary predecessors, a description of those who "devote themselves to the cause of the people." In life, there are many such people. The exemplary deeds of Fang Heming, an old Red Army regimental commander who returned to farming after being demobilized, working diligently and thriftily with the masses to build his hometown, are not precisely this style? In more than twenty years of revolutionary struggle, climbing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, shedding blood and sweat, he regarded these as merely the duties of a Communist Party member. After victory, he enjoyed the victory with the farmers, with no special demands. "In the past, I needed to fight, so I went to fight. Now, I need to engage in labor and production, so I come back to farm." He felt that it was a very natural thing for a Red Army regimental commander to become a farmer. What a noble pine tree style this is! Comrade Song Xueyi, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain, returned to his hometown as an ordinary demobilized soldier, enduring the hidden pain of his injured body, leading the masses to build their homes for eight years, without ever boasting to anyone. What a noble pine tree style this is!

    The pine tree's great spirit of self-sacrifice, its steadfast style of not fearing severe cold and scorching heat, and its optimistic spirit are all worthy of our eternal learning. Only those with great self-sacrifice are the most steadfast and optimistic. Comrade Song Xueyi is a shining example. His greatest satisfaction comes from gaining the trust of the masses. A person's ability may be great or small, but as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: As long as one has a spirit of utter selflessness, one is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people.

    The noble style and qualities of our revolutionary predecessors constantly inspire us to move forward. Although we are still far from the high requirements of having a noble pine tree style as hoped for by our revolutionary predecessors, "high mountains are looked up to, great conduct is followed, though we cannot reach it, our hearts aspire to it." We must use this to constantly spur ourselves on—to be a good revolutionary, like a great pine tree that is evergreen in winter and summer, and forever young.

    We earnestly hope that revolutionary veterans on all fronts can, like Comrade Tao Zhu, use essays or other forms to express noble sentiments, form a new literary style of the socialist era, and inspire everyone.

    发扬松树风格
    ——读“松树的风格”一文以后
    文修华
    “松树的风格”是一篇很好的杂文、是一篇激励人们意气昂扬、热情奋发的好文章。我连读三遍，爱不释手。杂文，大概一般是指那些有所感触、抒发情怀、不拘形式、信手拈来的短文章，报上发的不少，但有的知识分子味道太浓，有的与长篇理论文章无甚区别，有的又过于杂了，气魄不大，读后不能给人以强烈的感染。
    “打开别人心灵的钥匙，是作者自己的内心。”陶铸同志在“松树的风格”一文中，就是这样在读者面前坦开了他那像水晶般透明的心灵，抒发着高尚的情操，把我们引入了一个崇高的内心境界。
    陶铸同志用鲁迅先生的“我吃的是草、挤出来的是牛奶、血。”一句话，来作为松树的风格的写照，我看，这也是对我们革命前辈的风格的写照，对那些为人民事业“鞠躬尽瘁”的人的写照。在生活中，这样的人是很多的。红军老团长方和明同志解甲当农民，与群众一道克勤克俭地建设家乡的模范事迹，不正是这种风格么？在二十多年的革命斗争中，爬雪山、过草地、流血流汗，他把这些看成只不过是一个共产党员份内之事。胜利了，与农民一样享受胜利，毫无特殊要求。“过去需要打仗，我就去打仗，现在需要劳动生产，我就回来耕田。”他觉得一个红军团长去当农民是一件非常自然的事，这是一种多么崇高的松树风格。狼牙山五壮士之一的宋学义同志，以一个普通复员军人的身份，回到家乡，忍受伤残身体的隐痛，领导群众建设家园，八年之久，从没有向人们夸耀过自己。这又是一种多么崇高的松树风格啊！
    松树这种伟大的自我牺牲风格，不畏严寒酷暑的坚定风格，松树的乐观主义精神，都是值得我们每一个人永远学习的。也只有那种富有伟大自我牺牲的人才是最坚定的人，最乐观的人，宋学义同志便是光辉的典范。他感到最大的快慰，就是得到群众的信任。一个人的能力有大有小，但正如毛泽东同志教导我们的：只要有毫无自私自利之心的精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    革命前辈们的崇高风格和品质，时刻鼓舞着我们前进。虽然我们距革命前辈所希望的那样具有崇高的松树风格的要求还差很远，但“高山仰止，景行行止，虽不能至，心向往之”，我们一定要以此来经常的鞭策自己——做一个好比大松树冬夏长青，永远是年青的革命者。
    我们殷切期望着各个战线上的革命老战士们，都能像陶铸同志那样，用杂文或其他形式，抒发崇高的情怀，形成社会主义时代的新文风，激励大家。
