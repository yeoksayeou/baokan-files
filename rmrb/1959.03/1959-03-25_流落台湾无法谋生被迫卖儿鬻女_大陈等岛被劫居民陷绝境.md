Xinhua News Agency, March 24th, Taipei Dispatch: Recent reports in various Taiwanese newspapers have revealed the extremely tragic living conditions of residents from Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and the Nanjishan Islands in Zhejiang Province, who are now in Taiwan. Approximately 20,000 residents from Dachen and other islands were abducted to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek Group with the participation of the United States in February 1955, just before our army crossed the sea to liberate these islands.

According to a report published in Taiwan's "United Daily News" on March 8th, the more than 1,000 Dachen Island residents who were abducted and resettled in Dawu Township, Taitung County, were allocated land by the Chiang Kai-shek Group that was "entirely unsuitable for cultivation and impossible to farm" due to being rocky mountains. They wished to make a living by fishing, but the nearby Shangwu fishing port has been in disrepair for years, and they lack the funds to purchase fishing boats and gear to go out to sea. The simple thatched huts they built were mostly destroyed by a recent typhoon. Therefore, these Dachen Island residents, who have been "uprooted from their homes and displaced to foreign lands," have "long been in a desperate situation" and are currently only surviving on a daily ration of sweet potato porridge provided by the Taitung County Fishery Administration Office. This group of Dachen Island residents, residing in Dawu Township, recently sent representatives to the relevant authorities of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, requesting the allocation of arable wasteland for them to cultivate, a resolution to the fishing problem, and relief for those whose houses were destroyed by the typhoon, but all requests were denied. The report stated that the representatives of the Dachen Island residents repeatedly protested and expressed indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek Group's Taitung County authorities' "collusion with local bullies to oppress the Dachen residents."

Taiwanese newspapers report that Dachen Island fishermen resettled in Nanshihu, Linbian, and other villages in Pingtung County are facing a desperate situation because their fishing boats and nets are old and dilapidated, and they lack the funds to replace them, preventing many from engaging in fishing production. Reports state that many Dachen residents scattered throughout Taiwan, unable to make a living after being uprooted from their homes, have been forced to sell their children. Some women have been repeatedly trafficked and forced into prostitution in Chiang's army's "military brothels" or "American military brothels."

### 流落台湾无法谋生被迫卖儿鬻女  大陈等岛被劫居民陷绝境

    流落台湾无法谋生被迫卖儿鬻女
    大陈等岛被劫居民陷绝境
    新华社24日讯　台北消息：最近台湾各地报纸发表的一些消息中，透露了在台湾的浙江省大陈岛、渔山列岛、披山岛、南麂山列岛的居民，生活非常悲惨。大陈等岛上的约二万名居民，是在1955年2月间我军渡海解放这些岛屿的前夕，被蒋介石集团在美国参与下劫到台湾去的。
    据台湾“联合报”3月8日发表的消息说，被劫到台东县大武乡居住的一千多名大陈岛居民，蒋介石集团分配给他们的土地，都是“全部不堪开垦、无法耕种”的石头山。他们想捕鱼为生，也因附近的尚武渔港年久失修，没有钱购置渔船渔具而无法出海。他们盖搭的简陋茅屋，在不久前大部分被台风刮毁。因此，这些“毁家离乡、流落异地”的大陈岛居民“生活已早陷绝境”，目前只靠台东县渔民管理处每天发给一顿番薯丝粥来苟延残喘。这群寄居在大武乡的大陈岛居民，最近推派代表向蒋介石集团有关机关要求拨给能够开垦的荒地给他们开垦耕种，解决捕鱼问题和对房屋被风灾所毁者加以救济，都没有结果。消息说，大陈岛居民的代表们对蒋介石集团台东县当局“勾结恶霸欺压大陈居民”的行为，一再抗议，表示愤慨。
    台湾报纸说，被安置在屏东县南势湖、林边等乡村的大陈岛渔民，由于渔船和渔网都年久破烂，又缺乏资金添置，以致许多人都无法从事渔捞生产，生活陷入绝境。消息说，散居在台湾各地的大陈居民在离乡背井无法谋生的境况下，许多人被迫卖儿卖女，有些妇女被辗转贩卖，堕入蒋军“军中乐园”或“美军乐园”妓院的火坑中。
