    What is Aplastic Anemia?
    Mu Feng
    The People's Daily editorial on January 25th, "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine," mentioned the names of many diseases, including "aplastic anemia." What exactly is this disease?
    Blood is a very precious thing. It bears the important task in the body of transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide, transporting nutrients, certain wastes, endocrine hormones, and regulating the acidity and alkalinity of body fluids. The total amount of blood in the human body is approximately 8% of body weight. For example, if your weight is one hundred pounds, you have eight pounds of blood, which is about 4000 CC. The red color of blood mainly comes from red blood cells because they contain red hemoglobin. Adult men have about thirteen grams of hemoglobin per hundred milliliters of blood, and women have about twelve grams.
    An individual also has a certain number of red blood cells, about four and a half to five million red blood cells per cubic millimeter. If all the red blood cells in a person's body were lined up one by one, they could circle the Earth's equator three and a half times!
    The body has factories that manufacture red blood cells. During the fetal stage, the factory sites are the liver and bone marrow, but in adults, the bone marrow bears all the responsibility. The raw materials supplied to the factory for making red blood cells include food (including iron, vitamins, protein), digestive juices... and so on.
    If a person's total blood volume is less than one-third of the original amount, or hemoglobin is less than eleven grams, or red blood cells are less than three million per cubic millimeter, we say that they are suffering from anemia.
    The causes of anemia can be various, such as acute or chronic blood loss, malnutrition, failure to supply sufficient hematopoietic raw materials, etc. Also, even if hematopoietic raw materials are not lacking, if the hematopoietic factory has a problem and cannot produce products – red blood cells – it can also cause anemia. The latter situation is "aplastic anemia."
    Western medicine treats anemia mainly by targeting the cause. For example, if there is a lack of hematopoietic raw materials, patients are given iron, vitamin B12, liver extract... and so on. However, for "aplastic anemia," because the cause is still unknown, it is difficult to deal with. Apart from blood transfusions, there are very few active measures that can be taken.
    Traditional Chinese medicine treatment principles are mainly based on symptoms, which is what is usually referred to as "treatment based on syndrome differentiation." As long as there are symptoms, treatment can be carried out. Regardless of whether you have iron-deficiency anemia, aplastic anemia, or even other non-anemia diseases, as long as symptoms such as pallor, palpitations, dizziness, and bleeding are present, the same principles can be used for treatment.
    Traditional Chinese medicine believes that pallor, palpitations, dizziness, etc., are due to blood deficiency, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and weakness are due to qi deficiency, and bleeding is caused by blood heat. Therefore, the treatment principles are to tonify qi, nourish blood, clear heat, etc. Based on this principle, many cases of aplastic anemia, which were previously considered terminal illnesses, have been saved. Some patients have even become athletes after recovering their health.
    Traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a great treasure house, but diagnosing aplastic anemia is not an easy task and requires bone marrow, blood... and other examinations. In order to enrich modern medicine and better serve the health of the people, it is indeed necessary to combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for each other's shortcomings.

### 什么是再生不良性贫血？

    什么是再生不良性贫血？
    木风
    1月25日人民日报“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论中，曾提到许多疾病的名字，其中有“再生不良性贫血”，这究竟是个什么病呢？
    血液是很宝贵的东西，它在身体里负担着运送氧气、二氧化碳，运输营养料、某些废物、内分泌素和调节身体体液的酸碱性的重要任务。人体的血液总量约等于体重的8％，比如，你的体重是一百斤，就有八斤血，大约是四千CC。血液的红颜色，主要来自红血球，因为它含有红色的血色蛋白。成年男子每一百毫升血液中有十三克左右，女子有十二克左右。
    一个人的红血球也有一定数目，大约每一立方毫米内有红血球四百五十至五百万个，一个人全身的红血球如果一个挨一个地排列起来，就可以绕地球赤道三圈半！
    身体有制造红血球的工厂，在胎儿时期工厂的厂址是肝脏和骨髓，成年人就全部由骨髓负担了。供给工厂造红血球原料的有食物，（包括铁质、维生素、蛋白质）、消化液……等等。
    如果一个人的血液总量少于原量的三分之一，或血色素少于十一克，红血球每立方毫升少于三百万个，我们就说是患了贫血了。
    贫血的原因可以是多种多样的，比如急性或慢性的失血、营养不良，不能供给足够的造血原料等等，还有，虽然造血原料没缺，但造血工厂出了毛病，造不出产品——红血球来，也可以引起贫血，后一种情况就是“再生不良性贫血”。
    西医治疗贫血，主要是针对病因，比如，缺少造血原料，就给病人铁质、维生素B12，肝精……等等，但是，对于“再生不良性贫血”，由于原因还不明了，很难应付，除去输血以外，可以说是很少积极的办法。
    中医治疗原则主要是根据症状，也就是平时所说的“辨证施治”，只要有症状，就能治疗。不管你是缺铁性贫血也罢、再生不良性贫血也罢，甚至其他非贫血疾病也罢，只要表现出苍白、心跳、头晕、出血的症状，就可以用同一原则来治。
    中医认为苍白、心跳、头晕等等是血虚，气短、气迫、无力是气虚，而出血则是血热所致。因此治疗原则是补气、补血、清热等等。根据这个原则，已经有很多过去被认为是绝症的再生不良性贫血得救，有些患者恢复健康后甚至还成了运动员。
    祖国医学确实是一个大宝库，但是，要诊断再生不良性贫血不是一件容易的事，必需有骨髓、血液……等等检查。为了丰富现代医学，更好地为人民的健康服务，中西医互相结合，互相取长补短，确实大有必要。
