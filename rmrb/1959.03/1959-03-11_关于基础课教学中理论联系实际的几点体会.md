    Some Experiences on Integrating Theory with Practice in Basic Course Teaching
    Li Zhuobao, Secretary of the General Branch of the Public Teaching and Research Group, Tsinghua University
      I. Basic Courses Not Only Cannot Be Eliminated, But Must Be Strengthened
    Since Tsinghua University implemented the Party Central Committee's policy on combining education with productive labor, the shortcomings of basic theoretical courses (i.e., compulsory public courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, theoretical mechanics, and mechanics of materials, hereinafter referred to as basic courses) in teaching, such as being detached from reality, detached from professional requirements, and blindly pursuing abstract theory, have become more obvious. People urgently demand that basic courses correct these shortcomings as soon as possible and catch up with the needs. But how to make basic courses connect with reality and combine with professional fields? This issue has been debated.
    Through debate, we have gained a deeper understanding of the significant role of basic courses in cultivating red engineers. Taking physics as an example, it not only enables students to master systematic theory and prepare relevant theoretical knowledge for professional learning, but also enables students to have a comprehensive and unified understanding of the entire material world. Therefore, when teaching material phenomena and their various laws of motion in physics courses, it is necessary to explain their position in natural laws and their interconnections, etc., instead of teaching them in isolation. There are extremely close connections between the several parts of physics, such as sound, light, heat, force, electricity, molecular physics, and atomic physics. Not studying these connections and only teaching each chapter in isolation will affect students' thorough understanding of the basic laws of physics. Such a task cannot be shared by technical basic courses. For example, if the chemistry course is cancelled and only supplemented when professional courses require chemical knowledge, the result will inevitably be that students' knowledge is fragmented, greatly limiting their creativity. If students only know the properties and uses of carbon and germanium respectively, but do not understand the connection between them based on the systematic theoretical foundation of Mendeleev's periodic law, it is impossible to have the foresight that there may be germanium in coal ash if there is carbon, and thus extract germanium from coal ash. In fact, in many cases, without a systematic theoretical foundation, it is very difficult to teach a specific topic or a fragment, which often seriously affects the quality of students' knowledge.
    Basic courses should prepare necessary theoretical knowledge for professional courses, but this does not mean teaching students whatever professional courses need. We must enable students to develop their professional knowledge on a broad and profound theoretical foundation. Only seeing today and not seeing tomorrow will not enable students to adapt to the rapidly developing situation of science and technology. New discoveries and creations in science and technology departments should be quickly reflected in basic courses so that basic theories can promote the adoption of new technologies by professional fields and promote the continuous development of production. For example, ultrasonic waves and radioactive isotopes were problems in modern physics not long ago, but recently they have begun to be widely used in various scientific and technological fields. It can be seen that cancelling or weakening basic courses is not compatible with the cultivation of high-quality engineers. In addition, doing so does not meet the requirements of cultivating students' dialectical materialist worldview through basic courses.
    It should be admitted that if basic courses do not overcome the shortcomings of being detached from reality and actively carry out reforms, it is impossible for them to play the above-mentioned role. However, the practice of cancelling, dismantling, or weakening basic courses cannot solve the problem. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to actively carry out reform work, so that basic courses can be improved along the direction of connecting with reality, combining with engineering majors, and continuously improving theoretical levels, so as to play a significant role in the process of cultivating red engineers.
    II. Actively Improve Basic Courses Under the Guidance of the Principle of Connecting with Reality, Combining with Engineering Majors, and Continuously Improving Theoretical Levels
    After basic course teachers affirmed the direction of connecting with reality, combining with engineering majors (hereinafter referred to as majors), and continuously improving theoretical levels, it does not mean that the problem is solved. There is also the question of how to combine. Some teachers believe that a major reform can be carried out with "application as the guiding principle," that is, breaking the past theoretical system and compiling a new system according to professional needs. Another opinion is that combining with majors can only be done by giving a few examples, otherwise it will violate the original scientificity and systematicness and lower the theoretical level. We believe that both of these opinions are one-sided.
    The basic task of basic courses is to teach the most basic phenomena and laws of nature. The theoretical system in past courses generally reflected the internal connections between objective laws, so it should not be easily changed according to the order or magnitude of their effects when people apply them. Moreover, because it describes the most basic natural phenomena and laws, it must be universal and generally encountered directly or indirectly in various engineering and technical sciences. It is inappropriate to arbitrarily reduce the content of basic courses or arbitrarily change their own system. The result will inevitably lead to the weakening of the theory itself.
    Basic courses should also be taught purposefully and with emphasis according to the different requirements of each department. Some comrades once understood purposeful and focused teaching as the specialization of basic courses, such as changing general chemistry to "electrical materials chemistry," etc. We believe this is inappropriate. Because basic courses describe the general laws of nature, they are generally suitable for each department. Specializing basic courses ignores their universality. Of course, it is also inappropriate to only see universality and not see particularity. When we say purposeful and focused teaching, it mainly refers to combining with the majors of each department to explain the theory more deeply and thoroughly, rather than replacing professional courses. Related to this issue, some comrades once believed that in order to better coordinate the teaching of basic courses with the needs of each department, the basic course teaching and research group should be dismantled and the teachers teaching basic courses should be assigned to each department. We believe that although there are certain differences in combining with majors between teachers teaching different majors, because what they are teaching is the same basic theoretical course, their commonality is even greater. These teaching and research groups will play a very significant role in studying how to improve the teaching quality of basic courses and strengthening basic theoretical research. However, in order for everyone to deeply study the majors, it is completely necessary to divide teachers into small groups within the teaching and research group, go to each department to participate in production and scientific research, and jointly study how to conduct purposeful and focused teaching according to the needs of different majors. Therefore, the opinion that teaching and research groups can be dismantled, although it has some truth, is not entirely appropriate. In fact, after teachers are divided into small groups and go deep into each department, the role of the entire basic course teaching and research group is not weakened, but strengthened. Especially since the basic theoretical level of teachers is not high at present and is far from meeting the requirements for independent problem-solving, this requires the leadership of the teaching and research group to not only organize everyone to study majors, but also to help everyone summarize and generalize common experiences in a timely manner, organize everyone to study various different basic theoretical problems, and improve teachers' teaching level and scientific level of basic theory.
    Because of the connection with reality and the combination with majors, there have been new creations in all teaching links. We believe that the teaching of basic courses should still focus on classroom teaching. However, supplementing it with on-site teaching combined with practical production, experiments combined with majors, and discussions in exercise classes at appropriate times has a very good effect. For example, mechanics of materials teachers used to lecture more abstractly, and students found it difficult to understand and apply. After finishing the basic theory of composite resistance this time, they conducted an on-site class, took students to the workshop, and guided students to use the theory they learned to simplify the stress analysis of the main shaft of the lathe, and finally drew the internal force diagram of the component and proposed a plan to increase strength and stiffness. It enabled students to understand how to simplify mechanical problems from engineering practice and how to apply the basic theories they learned to engineering practice, and achieved great results. It also cultivated students' ability to think independently. Of course, on-site classes have relatively large limitations, take a lot of time, and are not easy to meet comprehensive training, because practical problems are mostly more complex and not easy to achieve step-by-step progress. Each teaching link has its own role, so it cannot completely replace lectures and exercise classes, and can only be organized purposefully in the entire teaching plan. In the past, when the physics teaching and research group did experiments on the principle of polarized light, they only allowed students to use a saccharimeter to measure the concentration of sugar solutions. As a result, after students studied their majors, they needed to use photoelasticity to measure the stress distribution of dams, but they could not use the principle of polarized light to explain this phenomenon, and their creativity was greatly limited. This semester, the teachers of the physics teaching and research group combined with their majors to improve this experiment, making the experimental content closely related to photoelasticity. Such reform experiments not only deepened students' understanding of basic principles, achieved the purpose of using experiments to test theory, cultivating students' experimental skills, and giving students basic physical training, but also enriched the content of physics experiments and helped students understand how to apply this principle to solve practical production problems, which was welcomed by professional teachers and students. Of course, many original physics experiments in the past, although the content was relatively simple, simplified various complex objective factors in practice and helped students establish the most basic physical concepts and master the most basic physical laws, which was also very necessary and should not be easily changed.
    III. Basic Course Teachers Must Go Deep Into Each Department and Humbly Be Elementary School Students of Engineering Practice and Majors While Mastering Their Own Professional Skills
    How to enable basic course teachers to quickly master production and professional knowledge is the first problem encountered. There has also been debate on this issue. Some comrades believe that "Basic course teachers are mainly engaged in theory, so it is impossible and unnecessary for them to master engineering technical knowledge; just flip through professional books, talk to professional course teachers, and find a few examples of engineering practice." Another opinion is that "Basic course teachers in industrial universities should choose a major and take supplementary courses like students, so that after several years, they can reach the level of engineers. Only in this way can they completely master the needs and requirements of professional courses." To fundamentally solve the problems of serious detachment from reality and detachment from majors in past teaching work, basic course teachers are first required to honestly be elementary school students of practical production and majors, put down their airs, learn in production practice, and learn from everyone who understands engineering technical knowledge. Only in this way can they truly experience and truly master the needs and requirements of majors. However, this does not mean that they must start from the first grade like students. Such a requirement is unnecessary, and such a learning method is obviously slow, poor, and costly. Because basic course teachers are experts in their own scientific fields, they should be required to be familiar with engineering knowledge, master some engineering technology, and be basic theoretical experts who can engage in the study of basic theoretical problems in engineering practice.
    The implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor has created extremely favorable conditions for basic course teachers to widely and deeply participate in the production labor and scientific research of various departments, enabling them to master engineering technical knowledge and skills quickly, well, economically, and practically, thereby deeply experiencing the needs of professional courses. For example, a chemistry teacher who teaches in the Civil Engineering Department used to have a very abstract understanding of what chemical problems the Civil Engineering Department had. Later, he participated in the labor of making clay cement and discovered in production practice what components clay cement contains, what impact clay components and molecular structure have on the properties of cement, what chemical changes clay undergoes after being burned into cement in a coal kiln, and why the color and performance of cement are different after it is made. Many chemical problems such as what is the reason? It is difficult to understand these problems if you only flip through books and ask professional teachers to introduce them. After teachers participate in and become familiar with production, their theoretical knowledge can truly play a role. This requires teachers to personally participate in production and study hard. Basic course teachers participating in the scientific research of various departments can also help them become familiar with majors more quickly and improve their theoretical level and ability to solve practical problems in actual work. For example, physics teachers participating in the study of a certain aspect of the program-controlled machine tool in the Mechanical Engineering Department are faced with the problem of solving the application of gratings in the feedback system. To solve this problem, in-depth research must be carried out, which will strongly promote them to improve their optical level.
    Teachers participating in the production labor and scientific research of various departments can quickly master professional knowledge in practice. But this is not enough. Teachers should also systematically study some major professional theories, especially technical basic courses, which are not only follow-up courses to basic courses, but also the combined part of basic courses and professional courses. It is beneficial for each teaching and research group to choose their own relevant courses for further study according to this principle. Although the effectiveness of this kind of learning may not be seen for a while, we believe that in the long run, the benefits will be great. Under the guidance of this thought, the school also organized spare-time professional refresher courses for basic course teachers, organized them to study necessary professional courses, and conducted relevant visits, experiments, and internships.
    Basic course teachers must master their own professional skills and reach certain requirements, otherwise even if they learn engineering practical knowledge and understand the needs of majors, they will still not be able to solve the problem. Therefore, there must be different arrangements for teachers of various levels to ensure that everyone can start from their original foundation and cultivate themselves into basic theoretical experts who are familiar with engineering knowledge, master certain engineering technologies, and can engage in the study of basic theoretical problems in engineering practice as quickly as possible.
    IV. Establish a Cooperative Relationship Between Basic Courses and Professional Courses That Promotes Each Other and Improves Together
    The combination of basic courses and majors not only enriches teaching content and improves teaching quality, but also gradually affects professional courses. Here is an example: physics teachers who teach in the Hydraulic Engineering Department used to do experiments on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which was simply measuring the magnetic field of a coil. After students finished it, they quickly forgot it and did not know how to use it. This time, the physics teachers went to the department and found that the instrument used by the Hydraulic Engineering Department to measure water flow velocity used this principle. So, after returning to the teaching and research group, they improved it and arranged an experiment on a flow velocity meter, so that students could more deeply grasp this principle and the method of measuring magnetic fields in combination with their majors. At the same time, they also helped the Hydraulic Engineering Department improve this instrument. Later, students further improved it on the basis of the improvement made by the physics teachers in the professional course, and made a simple and accurate flow velocity meter, which improved the level of this experiment in the Hydraulic Engineering Department. As for increasing the content of cutting-edge science in basic courses, it can better promote the improvement of the level of professional courses. These examples powerfully illustrate that the relationship between basic courses and professional courses is not a simple service of basic courses to professional courses, but a relationship of mutual promotion and common improvement. We firmly believe that under the light of the Party's education policy, strengthening cooperation in this area will more quickly improve students' learning quality and catch up with the needs of China's socialist construction.

    关于基础课教学中理论联系实际的几点体会
    中共清华大学公共教研组总支书记  李卓宝
      一、基础课不但不能取消而且必须加强
    自从清华大学贯彻党中央关于教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以来，基础理论课（即数学、物理、化学、理论力学、材料力学等公共必修课，简称基础课）教学工作中那种脱离实际、脱离专业要求、盲目追求抽象理论的缺点，暴露得更加明显了。人们迫切要求基础课能尽快的纠正这些缺点，赶上需要。但是怎样使基础课联系实际、结合专业呢？这个问题是曾经有过争论的。
    经过争论，我们对基础课在培养红色工程师过程中的重大作用，有了更深刻的认识。以物理课为例，它不仅仅使学生掌握系统理论，为学习专业准备有关的理论知识，而且使学生对整个物质世界有一个全面统一的了解，因此在物理课中讲授物质现象及其运动的各种规律，就不能孤立地去讲，必须要讲清它们在自然规律中的地位、相互之间的联系等等。物理学中声、光、热、力、电、分子物理、原子物理等几个部分之间有着极其密切的联系，不去研究这些联系，只是孤立的去讲每一个章节，将会影响学生对物理学基本规律的透彻理解。这样一个任务，技术基础课显然是分担不了的。又如把化学课取消掉，只在专业课需要化学知识时再补充上去，这样的结果，必然会使学生掌握的知识是片断零碎的，大大限制了学生的创造性。如果学生只分别知道炭和锗的性质、用途，而不知道在门得列夫周期律的系统理论基础上去理解它们之间的联系，就不可能产生煤灰里有炭就可能有锗的预见，从而在煤灰里提炼出锗来。事实上，在相当多的情况下，没有系统的理论基础，要讲好某一个专题，或某一个片断，是十分困难的，其结果往往会严重影响学生的知识质量。
    基础课要为专业课准备必要的理论知识，但这并不是专业课需要什么就教给学生什么。我们必须要使学生在广泛的深刻的理论基础上发展他们的专业知识，只看见今天，不看见明天，就不能使学生适应今天科学技术发展一日千里的形势。科学技术部门的新发现、新创造，应该在基础课中迅速得到反映，使基础理论能够促进专业采用新技术，促进生产不断发展。例如超声波与放射性同位素，在不久以前还是近代物理学中的问题，但在最近已开始在各种不同的科学技术中得到广泛的应用。由此可见，取消或削弱基础课，是与培养高质量的工程师不相适应的。此外，这样做也不符合通过基础课培养同学辩证唯物主义世界观的要求。
    应该承认，如果基础课不克服脱离实际的缺点，积极进行改革，要使它起上述作用是不可能的。但是，取消、拆散或削弱基础课的做法更不能解决问题。因此，我们认为必须积极进行改革工作，使基础课沿着联系实际、结合工程专业，不断提高理论水平的方向改进，以发挥它在培养红色工程师过程中的重大作用。
    二、在联系实际结合工程专业，不断提高理论水平的原则指导下积极改进基础课
    基础课教师肯定了联系实际、结合工程专业（以下简称专业）不断提高理论水平的方向以后，并不等于说问题就解决了。这里还有一个如何结合的问题。有的教师认为可以以“应用为纲”来一番大改革，即打破过去的理论系统，根据专业需要，另编系统。另一种意见则认为结合专业只能是举几个例子，否则就会违反了原来的科学性与系统性，降低理论水平。我们认为这两种意见都是片面的。
    基础课的基本任务是讲授自然界最基本的现象与规律，过去课程中的理论系统大体上反映了客观规律之间的内在联系，因此不宜轻易根据人们应用它们时的顺序或作用大小去变动它。而且由于它是讲述最基本的自然现象与规律，因此就必然带有普遍性，在各种工程技术科学中一般都会直接或间接碰到。随便去削减基础课的内容，和随便改变它本身的系统，都是不妥当的。其结果必然会导致理论本身的削弱。
    基础课还应该根据各系不同的要求，进行有目的、有重点的讲述。曾有同志把有目的、有重点的讲述，理解为基础课专业化，即如把普通化学改为“电工材料化学”等，我们认为是不妥当的。因为基础课是讲述自然界一般的规律，它大体上对各系都是合适的。把基础课专业化，就是忽略了它的普遍性。当然，只看到普遍性而看不见特殊性也是不恰当的。我们说有目的、有重点的讲述，主要也是指针对各系不同的要求，结合各系的专业，把理论讲得更深入透彻，而不是去代替专业课。与这个问题相联系，也曾经有同志认为，为了使基础课更好配合各系需要进行教学，应该把基础课教研组拆散，把教基础课的教师分到各系去。我们认为教不同专业的教师，在结合专业上，虽然有一定的差别性，但是因为他们所讲授的，却都是同一门基础理论课，因此他们的共同性也就更大。这样一些教研组在研究如何提高基础课的教学质量上，加强基础理论研究上都将起着很重大的作用。不过，为了大家深入学习专业，把教师在教研组内分成小组，到各系去参加生产、科研，并共同研究如何针对不同专业的需要，进行有目的有重点的讲述，则是完全必要的。因此，那种认为教研组可以拆散的意见，虽然有一定道理，但是不完全恰当。事实上，教师分成小组，深入各系以后，整个基础课教研组的作用，不是削弱，而是加强了，特别是目前教师的基础理论水平都不高，离独立解决问题的要求还很远，这就要求教研组的领导除了组织大家学习专业以外，还要及时帮助大家总结概括共同的经验，组织大家对各种不同基础理论问题的研究，提高教师基础理论的教学水平与科学水平。
    由于联系了实际，结合了专业，各个教学环节都有了新的创造。我们认为基础课的教学仍然应该以课堂讲授为主。但是在适当的时候，辅以结合生产实际的现场教学、结合专业的实验、习题课上进行讨论，效果却是很好的。如材料力学教师，过去讲课比较抽象，同学也感到难以理解和运用。这次讲完复合抗力的基本理论以后，进行了现场课，把学生带到车间里去，指导同学运用学到的理论对车床主轴进行支承简化受力分析，最后画出构件的内力图，提出增加强度、刚度的方案。使学生了解怎样从工程实际中简化出力学问题和如何把所学到的基本理论应用到工程实际中去，收到了很大的效果。也培养了同学的独立思考能力。当然现场课有比较大的局限性，花的时间多，不容易满足全面训练，因为实际问题多半是比较复杂的，不易做到循序渐进，而各教学环节都有其各自的作用，因此不能完全代替讲课和习题课，只能组织在整个教学计划中有目的的进行。物理教研组过去做偏振光原理实验时，只让学生用糖量计去测量糖溶液的浓度，结果学生学专业以后，需要用光弹性来测量坝的应力分布，不会用偏振光原理来解释这个现象，创造性受到很大限制。这学期物理教研组的教师们结合专业改进了这个实验，使实验内容密切与光弹性相结合。像这样的改革实验，不但加深了学生对基本原理的了解，达到了以实验检验理论，培养学生实验技能，给学生以基本物理训练的目的，而且丰富了物理实验的内容，帮助同学初步懂得如何应用这个原理来解决生产实际中的问题，受到了专业教师和学生的欢迎。当然过去有不少原有的物理实验虽然内容比较简单，但简化了实践中各种复杂的客观因素，帮助学生建立最基本的物理概念，掌握最基本的物理规律，也是十分必要的，不能轻易地改动。
    三、基础课教师在学好本门业务的同时必须深入各系虚心做工程实际与专业的小学生
    如何使基础课教师迅速掌握生产与专业知识是个首先遇到的问题，对这个问题，也曾经有过争论，有的同志认为：“基础课教师，主要是搞理论的，因此不可能也不必要让他们掌握工程技术知识；只要翻翻专业书，和专业课教师谈谈，找几个工程实际的例子就可以了。”另一种意见则认为：“工业大学里的基础课教师应该选择一种专业，像学生一样，进行补课，务使若干年后，达到工程师水平，只有这样，才可能彻底掌握专业课的需要与要求。”要从根本上解决过去教学工作中严重脱离实际脱离专业的问题，首先要求基础课教师老老实实当生产实际与专业的小学生，放下架子，在生产实践中学习，向一切懂得工程技术知识的人们学习，只有这样，他们才可能切实体会与真正掌握专业的需要与要求。但是这并不等于说，他们就必须和学生一样，从一年级学起，这样的要求是不必要的，而且这样一个学习方法，显然是少慢差费的。因为基础课教师是其本门科学的专家，对他们的要求应该是熟悉工程知识、掌握一些工程技术，能够从事研究工程实际中基础理论问题的基础理论专家。
    教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的贯彻，给基础课教师广泛而深入的参加各系的生产劳动与科学研究创设了极有利的条件，使他们有可能在实践中多快好省地掌握工程技术知识与技能，从而深刻体会专业课的需要。如有一位教土木系的化学教师，过去对土木系有什么化学问题了解得很抽象，后来他参加了造粘土水泥的劳动，就在生产实践中发现了粘土水泥含有什么成分、粘土成分和分子结构对水泥的性质有什么影响、粘土经过煤窑燃烧变成水泥又有什么样的化学变化；水泥制成后，颜色性能不一样等等化学上的问题，这又是什么原因？……等等许多化学上的问题。这些问题如果光靠翻翻书，请专业教师介绍介绍是很难了解得到的。教师参加并熟悉了生产以后，教师的理论知识才真正发挥作用。这就要求教师们亲身参加到生产中去认真钻研。基础课教师参加各系的科学研究，也可以帮助他们更快的熟悉专业，并在实际工作中提高自己的理论水平和解决实际问题的能力。如物理教师参加机械系程序控制机床某一方面工作的研究，就面临着要在反馈系统中解决光栅的应用问题，要解决这个问题，就必须进行深入的研究工作，这也就有力地推动了他们提高自己的光学水平。
    教师参加了各系的生产劳动与科学研究，就可以很快地在实践中掌握专业知识。但这还不够，还应让教师系统地学习一些主要的专业理论，特别是技术基础课，它不但是基础课的后续课程，而且是基础课与专业课的结合部分。各教研组根据这一原则可选择自己相关的课程进行进修是有好处的，虽然，这种学习一时也可能看不见功效，但是我们相信从长远来看，好处会是很大的。在这种思想指导下，学校又为基础课教师组织了业余专业进修班，组织他们学习必要的专业课，进行有关的参观、实验、实习等活动。
    基础课教师必须要掌握好本门业务，达到一定的要求，否则即使是学习了工程实际知识，了解了专业的需要，仍然解决不了问题。因此对各种不同程度的教师，必须要有不同的安排，务使他们每个人都能从原有的基础出发，以最快速度把自己培养成为熟悉工程知识，掌握一定工程技术，能够从事研究工程实际中基础理论问题的基础理论专家。
    四、建立基础课与专业课相互促进，共同提高的合作关系
    基础课结合了专业不但使教学内容丰富了，教学质量提高了，而且对专业课也逐渐发生了影响。有这样一个例子，教水利系的物理教师过去做电磁感应原理的实验，就是简单的测一个线圈的磁场，学生做完以后很快就忘了，也不知道怎样用。这次物理教师到系里去发现水利系测水流速度的仪器，就是利用这个原理，于是回教研组以后，经过改进，排出了一个流速仪的实验，使同学结合专业更深入的掌握这个原理和测磁场的方法。与此同时，又帮助水利系改进了这个仪器。后来同学又在专业课中，进一步在物理教师改进的基础上进行了改进，做出了一个简便准确的流速仪，提高了水利系这个实验的水平。至于在基础课中增加有关尖端科学的内容，则更能促进专业课水平的提高。这些例子，有力的说明了基础课和专业课的关系，不是简单的基础课为专业课服务，而是相互促进，共同提高的关系。我们深信，在党的教育方针照耀下，加强这方面的合作，将会更快的提高学生的学习质量，赶上我国社会主义建设的需要。
