The Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion. This grave crime of betraying the motherland, undermining unity, and destroying national solidarity is absolutely intolerable to all ethnic groups in the country, including the patriotic people of Tibet. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has been ordered to thoroughly quell the rebellion. To safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council has issued an order to dissolve the Tibetan local government, the organizer of this rebellion, and decided that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan Local Government. Currently, the People's Liberation Army, with the active assistance of patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet, has swiftly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area and is clearing out the bandits in other parts of Tibet. Patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet warmly support the central government's measures and denounce the traitorous clique. People of all ethnic groups in other parts of the country also unanimously condemn the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan reactionary clique. We extend our cordial greetings to our compatriots in Tibet who have suffered at the hands of the rebels, and we pay our highest respects to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet for their meritorious service in quelling the rebellion.

The Tibetan people are one of the ethnic groups with a long history in China. Like other ethnic groups in the country, they have made their own contributions to the creation and development of our great motherland. However, in modern times, due to the intrusion of imperialism, the policies of national oppression and division adopted by the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and the enslavement of the people by the Tibetan reactionary ruling clique at home and their reliance on imperialism abroad, the Tibetan people have long been trapped in a dark, poor, and backward abyss. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tibet achieved peaceful liberation and returned to the big family of the motherland. Since then, the central government has consistently adhered to the policies of national unity, ethnic equality, and gradually realizing national regional autonomy and democratic reform in Tibet. The central government has taken a series of measures to promote mutual understanding and unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples. The central government has also done its best to promote unity within the Tibetan people, especially between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. In April 1956, after full consultation with the Tibetan local government, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, with the Dalai Lama as the chairman and the Panchen Lama as the first vice-chairman, and widely absorbed people from all walks of life in Tibet. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have consistently adhered to discipline, cherished the people, respected local religious beliefs and customs, did not take a single needle or thread from the masses, and established farms, factories, hospitals, and schools, built bridges and roads, and helped the development of the local economy and culture. Because of all this, the central government and the People's Liberation Army have been warmly loved by the vast masses of people in Tibet.

The Tibetan people urgently demand democratic reform because they know that without reform, it is impossible to make Tibet prosperous and progressive. The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet stipulates that the Tibetan local government should carry out reforms automatically, and the Tibetan army should be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. Nevertheless, given the special historical circumstances in Tibet, the central government's consistent policy has been to strive to strengthen national unity and patiently await the awakening of the upper echelons of Tibet. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government did not change the original political system in Tibet, the Dalai Lama's inherent status and functions, or the income of the monasteries; officials at all levels, both monks and laymen, continued to perform their duties as usual. For officials who were pro-imperialist and pro-Kuomintang in the past, as long as they expressed their separation from the relationship with imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the central government did not hold them accountable for their past actions and allowed them to continue to serve. Even for those counter-revolutionaries who still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, the central government only instructed the Tibetan local government to be responsible for punishing them and did not directly arrest them and bring them to justice. The reason why the central government adopted such a policy of waiting and leniency was entirely to prioritize the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity, giving the Tibetan local government and upper-level figures ample time to consider. At the end of 1956, the central government announced to the Tibetan local government that democratic reforms could not be carried out in Tibet for six years, that is, before 1962; after this time, when to reform would still be determined by the future situation and jointly decided by Tibetan national leaders, upper-level figures, and the people.

However, the Tibetan reactionary clique fundamentally did not want regional autonomy; what they wanted was the so-called "Tibetan independence" that imperialist aggressors had been planning for many years. They used their position in the Kashag and the center of Kalimpong abroad to collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, actively gathering bandits, instructing these bandits to burn, kill, loot, harm the people, and attack People's Liberation Army stations and transportation lines. They also organized illegal so-called "people's conferences," preparing to tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet once they gathered sufficient strength and abolish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This reactionary clique thought they could use religious superstition to deceive the Tibetan people for a long time; they thought that imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries would give them strong support; they thought that neighboring countries such as India would become their backing; they regarded the central government's patience and tolerance as a sign of weakness and incompetence. Therefore, they acted recklessly, and their rebellious activities went from secret to public, from small-scale to large-scale, until they launched a full-scale armed rebellion.

The various facts for a long time have shown that the Tibetan reactionary clique is not only a destroyer of the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the Han and Tibetan peoples, but also a stumbling block to the prosperity and progress of the Tibetan people. Although the central government had long been aware of the various evil activities of the Tibetan local government, it still adopted an attitude of utmost benevolence and repeatedly warned them to take responsibility for stopping them, expecting that they would eventually repent. Even after the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the central government still made a final effort to ask them to pull back from the brink. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique stubbornly refused to change, even kidnapping the Dalai Lama and launching a full-scale military offensive against the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, destroying the hope of a peaceful resolution and embarking on a path of self-destruction. In this unbearable situation, the central government ordered the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet to launch a punitive expedition against the Tibetan traitorous clique and thoroughly quell the rebellion. Therefore, patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet fully realize that the central government has made the greatest efforts to maintain national unity, and that now, only by suppressing the rebellion and thoroughly crushing the heinous traitorous clique can we continue to maintain national unity.

The primary task in Tibet at present is to completely eliminate all rebels and establish a peaceful order. The proclamation of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Xinhua News Agency's communiqu√© on the Tibetan rebellion have made clear the various policies that the government will adopt in this process. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army will resolutely unite all monks and laypeople in Tibet who have not participated in the rebellion; even for the rebels, they will adhere to the policy of leniency, treat them differently, that is, those who return will not be held accountable for their past actions, those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded, and prisoners will not be killed or humiliated, only those who resist stubbornly will be severely punished. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet will continue to adhere to the consistent policy of respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the masses, protecting lama temples, and protecting cultural relics and historical sites. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will exercise the functions and powers of the local government and actively promote the realization of national autonomy in Tibet. During the period when the Dalai Lama is kidnapped, Panchen Erdeni will serve as acting chairman. Of course, the rebellion of the Tibetan traitorous clique proves that it is necessary to carry out democratic reforms in Tibet, but the central government will still conduct full consultations with patriotic people from the upper and middle classes and the masses of people from all walks of life in Tibet on the timing, steps, and methods of implementing reforms. We believe that after crushing the rebellious clique, the unity of both the Han and Tibetan peoples and the internal unity of the Tibetan people will be greatly strengthened. On this basis, Tibet will gradually embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress.

The treasonous activities of the Tibetan reactionary clique have always been carried out with the support of imperialists. After the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the imperialists thought that the so-called "Tibetan independence" that they had dreamed of for a long time would become a reality. Therefore, they shouted and cheered to support the Tibetan traitorous clique. However, the good times did not last long, and the People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area. Then, the imperialists and foreign reactionaries concentrated their propaganda fire to attack People's China. The U.S. State Department issued several statements in succession, slandering the Chinese government for violating the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, saying that China wanted to "destroy religious and political autonomy," and hypocritically "expressing deep sympathy" for the "Tibetan people who are under such barbaric interference." People remember that eight years ago, when the Chinese central government reached an agreement with the Tibetan local government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, reactionaries in the United States and other countries vigorously attacked this agreement. Now, they have turned around and become defenders of this resolution. What a great irony! The U.S. State Department's slander is not worth refuting, because it is not the central government that is violating the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and does not want Tibet to implement national autonomy, but precisely the Tibetan reactionary clique supported and instigated by U.S. imperialism and foreign reactionaries. Even the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department could not but say that the United States has never considered Tibet to be an independent country. The rebellion in Tibet and the quelling of the rebellion are entirely China's internal affairs, and no foreign country may interfere in the Tibetan rebellion, which is purely China's internal affair. Everyone knows that the famous Five Principles, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were first proposed by our country and our great friendly neighbor India in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India on April 29, 1954. In June of the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Nehru of India issued a joint statement solemnly declaring that these Five Principles are the basic principles guiding relations between China and India. Since then, these Five Principles have also been the common principles for China to get along with Asian and African countries, especially with its southwestern neighbors. We are very pleased to see that after the Tibetan rebellion, Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement on March 23 stating that he would not interfere in China's internal affairs. We believe that the Chinese and Indian governments will continue to faithfully abide by the Five Principles and will not allow our two countries' friendly relations to be damaged.
