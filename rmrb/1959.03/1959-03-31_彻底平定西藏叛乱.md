The Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion. This grave crime of betraying the motherland, undermining unity, and destroying national solidarity is absolutely intolerable to all ethnic groups in the country, including the patriotic people of Tibet. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has been ordered to thoroughly quell the rebellion. To safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council has issued an order to dissolve the Tibetan local government, the organizer of this rebellion, and decided that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region shall exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan Local Government. Currently, the People's Liberation Army, with the active assistance of patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet, has swiftly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area and is clearing out the bandits in other parts of Tibet. Patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet warmly support the central government's measures and denounce the traitorous clique. People of all ethnic groups in other parts of the country also unanimously condemn the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan reactionary clique. We extend our cordial greetings to our compatriots in Tibet who have suffered at the hands of the rebels, and we pay our highest respects to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet for their meritorious service in quelling the rebellion.

The Tibetan people are one of the ethnic groups with a long history in China. Like other ethnic groups in the country, they have made their own contributions to the creation and development of our great motherland. However, in modern times, due to the intrusion of imperialism, the policies of national oppression and division adopted by the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and the enslavement of the people by the Tibetan reactionary ruling clique at home and their reliance on imperialism abroad, the Tibetan people have long been trapped in a dark, poor, and backward abyss. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tibet achieved peaceful liberation and returned to the big family of the motherland. Since then, the central government has consistently adhered to the policies of national unity, ethnic equality, and gradually realizing national regional autonomy and democratic reform in Tibet. The central government has taken a series of measures to promote mutual understanding and unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples. The central government has also done its best to promote unity within the Tibetan people, especially between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. In April 1956, after full consultation with the Tibetan local government, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, with the Dalai Lama as the chairman and the Panchen Lama as the first vice-chairman, and widely absorbed people from all walks of life in Tibet. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have consistently adhered to discipline, cherished the people, respected local religious beliefs and customs, did not take a single needle or thread from the masses, and established farms, factories, hospitals, and schools, built bridges and roads, and helped the development of the local economy and culture. Because of all this, the central government and the People's Liberation Army have been warmly loved by the vast masses of people in Tibet.

The Tibetan people urgently demand democratic reform because they know that without reform, it is impossible to make Tibet prosperous and progressive. The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet stipulates that the Tibetan local government should carry out reforms automatically, and the Tibetan army should be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. Nevertheless, given the special historical circumstances in Tibet, the central government's consistent policy has been to strive to strengthen national unity and patiently await the awakening of the upper echelons of Tibet. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government did not change the original political system in Tibet, the Dalai Lama's inherent status and functions, or the income of the monasteries; officials at all levels, both monks and laymen, continued to perform their duties as usual. For officials who were pro-imperialist and pro-Kuomintang in the past, as long as they expressed their separation from the relationship with imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the central government did not hold them accountable for their past actions and allowed them to continue to serve. Even for those counter-revolutionaries who still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, the central government only instructed the Tibetan local government to be responsible for punishing them and did not directly arrest them and bring them to justice. The reason why the central government adopted such a policy of waiting and leniency was entirely to prioritize the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity, giving the Tibetan local government and upper-level figures ample time to consider. At the end of 1956, the central government announced to the Tibetan local government that democratic reforms could not be carried out in Tibet for six years, that is, before 1962; after this time, when to reform would still be determined by the future situation and jointly decided by Tibetan national leaders, upper-level figures, and the people.

However, the Tibetan reactionary clique fundamentally did not want regional autonomy; what they wanted was the so-called "Tibetan independence" that imperialist aggressors had been planning for many years. They used their position in the Kashag and the center of Kalimpong abroad to collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, actively gathering bandits, instructing these bandits to burn, kill, loot, harm the people, and attack People's Liberation Army stations and transportation lines. They also organized illegal so-called "people's conferences," preparing to tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet once they gathered sufficient strength and abolish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This reactionary clique thought they could use religious superstition to deceive the Tibetan people for a long time; they thought that imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries would give them strong support; they thought that neighboring countries such as India would become their backing; they regarded the central government's patience and tolerance as a sign of weakness and incompetence. Therefore, they acted recklessly, and their rebellious activities went from secret to public, from small-scale to large-scale, until they launched a full-scale armed rebellion.

The various facts for a long time have shown that the Tibetan reactionary clique is not only a destroyer of the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the Han and Tibetan peoples, but also a stumbling block to the prosperity and progress of the Tibetan people. Although the central government had long been aware of the various evil activities of the Tibetan local government, it still adopted an attitude of utmost benevolence and repeatedly warned them to take responsibility for stopping them, expecting that they would eventually repent. Even after the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the central government still made a final effort to ask them to pull back from the brink. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique stubbornly refused to change, even kidnapping the Dalai Lama and launching a full-scale military offensive against the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, destroying the hope of a peaceful resolution and embarking on a path of self-destruction. In this unbearable situation, the central government ordered the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet to launch a punitive expedition against the Tibetan traitorous clique and thoroughly quell the rebellion. Therefore, patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet fully realize that the central government has made the greatest efforts to maintain national unity, and that now, only by suppressing the rebellion and thoroughly crushing the heinous traitorous clique can we continue to maintain national unity.

The primary task in Tibet at present is to completely eliminate all rebels and establish a peaceful order. The proclamation of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Xinhua News Agency's communiqué on the Tibetan rebellion have made clear the various policies that the government will adopt in this process. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army will resolutely unite all monks and laypeople in Tibet who have not participated in the rebellion; even for the rebels, they will adhere to the policy of leniency, treat them differently, that is, those who return will not be held accountable for their past actions, those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded, and prisoners will not be killed or humiliated, only those who resist stubbornly will be severely punished. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet will continue to adhere to the consistent policy of respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the masses, protecting lama temples, and protecting cultural relics and historical sites. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will exercise the functions and powers of the local government and actively promote the realization of national autonomy in Tibet. During the period when the Dalai Lama is kidnapped, Panchen Erdeni will serve as acting chairman. Of course, the rebellion of the Tibetan traitorous clique proves that it is necessary to carry out democratic reforms in Tibet, but the central government will still conduct full consultations with patriotic people from the upper and middle classes and the masses of people from all walks of life in Tibet on the timing, steps, and methods of implementing reforms. We believe that after crushing the rebellious clique, the unity of both the Han and Tibetan peoples and the internal unity of the Tibetan people will be greatly strengthened. On this basis, Tibet will gradually embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress.

The treasonous activities of the Tibetan reactionary clique have always been carried out with the support of imperialists. After the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the imperialists thought that the so-called "Tibetan independence" that they had dreamed of for a long time would become a reality. Therefore, they shouted and cheered to support the Tibetan traitorous clique. However, the good times did not last long, and the People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area. Then, the imperialists and foreign reactionaries concentrated their propaganda fire to attack People's China. The U.S. State Department issued several statements in succession, slandering the Chinese government for violating the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, saying that China wanted to "destroy religious and political autonomy," and hypocritically "expressing deep sympathy" for the "Tibetan people who are under such barbaric interference." People remember that eight years ago, when the Chinese central government reached an agreement with the Tibetan local government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, reactionaries in the United States and other countries vigorously attacked this agreement. Now, they have turned around and become defenders of this resolution. What a great irony! The U.S. State Department's slander is not worth refuting, because it is not the central government that is violating the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and does not want Tibet to implement national autonomy, but precisely the Tibetan reactionary clique supported and instigated by U.S. imperialism and foreign reactionaries. Even the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department could not but say that the United States has never considered Tibet to be an independent country. The rebellion in Tibet and the quelling of the rebellion are entirely China's internal affairs, and no foreign country may interfere in the Tibetan rebellion, which is purely China's internal affair. Everyone knows that the famous Five Principles, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were first proposed by our country and our great friendly neighbor India in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India on April 29, 1954. In June of the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Nehru of India issued a joint statement solemnly declaring that these Five Principles are the basic principles guiding relations between China and India. Since then, these Five Principles have also been the common principles for China to get along with Asian and African countries, especially with its southwestern neighbors. We are very pleased to see that after the Tibetan rebellion, Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement on March 23 stating that he would not interfere in China's internal affairs. We believe that the Chinese and Indian governments will continue to faithfully abide by the Five Principles and will not allow our two countries' friendly relations to be damaged.

### 彻底平定西藏叛乱

    彻底平定西藏叛乱
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，发动武装叛乱。这种背叛祖国、破坏统一、破坏民族团结的严重罪行，是全国各族人民包括西藏爱国人民所绝对不能容许的。人民解放军驻西藏部队已经奉命彻底平息叛乱。为了维护国家统一和民族团结，国务院周恩来总理已经发布命令，解散这次叛乱的组织者西藏地方政府，并决定由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权。现在，人民解放军在西藏爱国僧俗人民的积极协助下，已经迅速荡平了拉萨地区的叛乱，并且正在肃清西藏其他一些地区的叛匪。西藏僧俗各界爱国人民热烈拥护中央措施，声讨叛国集团，全国其他地方的各民族人民，也都一致声讨西藏反动集团的叛国罪行。我们向遭受叛匪蹂躏的西藏各界同胞表示亲切的慰问，向在平定叛乱中建立功勋的人民解放军驻西藏部队致以崇高的敬意。
    西藏民族是中国境内具有悠久历史的民族之一。它和国内其他民族一样，对于我们伟大祖国的缔造和发展，有过自己的贡献。但是在近代，由于帝国主义的侵入，由于满清王朝和国民党反动政府采取民族压迫和民族离间的政策，也由于西藏反动统治集团对内奴役人民，对外投靠帝国主义，西藏人民长期陷于黑暗、穷苦和落后的深渊。中华人民共和国成立以后，西藏实现了和平解放，回到了祖国大家庭。从那时以来，中央人民政府对于西藏一贯地坚持祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等和逐步实现民族区域自治、逐步实现民主改革的政策。中央采取了一系列的措施，努力促进汉藏两民族间的相互了解和团结。中央也尽力促进藏族内部、首先是达赖喇嘛和班禅之间的团结。1956年4月，经过同西藏地方政府的充分协商，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，由达赖喇嘛任主任委员，班禅任第一副主任委员，并广泛吸收藏族各阶层人士参加。进驻西藏的人民解放军部队，一贯严守纪律，爱护人民，尊重当地的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，不取群众一针一线，并且举办农场、工厂、医院和学校，修桥筑路，帮助当地经济文化的发展。因为这一切，中央人民政府和人民解放军受到了西藏各界广大群众的热烈爱戴。
    西藏人民迫切要求实行民主改革，因为他们知道，如果不实行改革，要使西藏繁荣进步是不可能的。关于和平解放西藏办法的协议中规定，西藏地方政府应自动进行改革，西藏军队应逐步改编为人民解放军。虽然如此，鉴于西藏地方的特殊历史情况，中央一贯的方针是努力加强民族团结，耐心等待西藏上层分子的觉悟。西藏和平解放后，对于西藏原有的政治制度、达赖喇嘛的固有地位和职权、寺院的收入，中央均未予变更；各级僧俗官员也照常供职。对于过去亲帝国主义和亲国民党的官员，只要他们表示脱离同帝国主义和国民党反动派的关系，中央也不咎既往，仍让他们继续任职。甚至对于那些在解放后仍然进行反革命活动的反革命分子，中央也只是责成西藏地方政府负责惩处，没有直接逮捕法办。中央所以采取这样的等待和宽大的政策，完全是以祖国的统一为重，以民族团结为重，给西藏地方政府和上层人士以充分的考虑时间。1956年底，中央并向西藏地方政府宣布，在六年内，即在1962年以前，在西藏可以不进行民主改革；在这以后什么时候改革，仍然要根据将来的情况，由西藏民族领袖、上层人士以及人民群众共同协商解决。
    但是，西藏的反动集团根本不要区域自治，他们要的是帝国主义侵略者多年策划的所谓“西藏独立”；他们利用在噶厦中的地位，利用在国外的噶伦堡为勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的中心，积极纠集叛匪，指使这些叛匪烧杀抢掠、残害人民、袭击人民解放军驻地和交通线，并且组织非法的所谓“人民会议”，准备一旦聚集了相当力量，就马上撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，取消西藏自治区筹备委员会。这个反动集团自以为他们能够利用宗教迷信长期欺骗西藏人民；他们以为帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派会给他们有力的支援，他们以为印度等邻国会成为他们的靠山，他们把中央的耐心等待和宽大为怀的态度看作是软弱无能的表现。因此，他们有恃无恐，叛乱活动由秘密到公开，由小规模到大规模，直至发动全面的武装叛乱。
    许久以来的种种事实表明，西藏反动集团不但是祖国统一和汉藏两大民族团结的破坏者，而且是西藏民族繁荣进步的绊脚石。中央虽然早已察觉西藏地方政府的种种罪恶活动，但仍然采取仁至义尽的态度，屡次告诫他们负责制止，期待他们最后能够憣然悔悟。甚至在3月10日拉萨叛乱发生后，中央仍然作最后的努力，要他们悬崖勒马。但是，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团顽固不化，竟然劫走达赖喇嘛，对人民解放军驻西藏部队发动全面军事进攻，摧毁了和平解决的希望，走上了自取灭亡的道路。在这种忍无可忍的情况下，中央才命令人民解放军驻西藏部队对西藏叛国集团进行讨伐，彻底平定叛乱。因此，西藏各界爱国人民充分认识到，中央人民政府为了维护民族团结确已尽了最大的努力，而在现在，只有讨平叛乱，彻底粉碎罪大恶极的叛国集团，才是继续维护民族团结的唯一道路。
    目前在西藏的首要任务是彻底肃清一切叛乱分子，建立和平秩序。关于在这一过程中政府所将采取的各项政策，人民解放军西藏军区的布告和新华社关于西藏叛乱事件的公报，都已经作了明确的说明。西藏自治区筹备委员会和人民解放军西藏军区将坚决团结全西藏一切没有参加叛乱的僧俗人民；就是对于叛乱分子，也将本宽大政策，区别对待，即来归者不咎既往，立功者给予奖励，对俘虏不杀不辱，只对顽抗者给以严惩。人民解放军驻藏部队将继续坚持尊重群众宗教信仰和风俗习惯、保护喇嘛寺庙、保护文物古迹的一贯方针。西藏自治区筹备委员会将行使地方政府的职权，并且积极促进西藏地方民族自治的实现。在达赖喇嘛被劫持期间，由班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员职务。当然，西藏叛国集团的叛乱，证明在西藏实行民主改革是必要的，但是关于实行改革的时机、步骤和办法，中央仍将同西藏上中层爱国人士和各界人民群众进行充分的协商。我们相信，在粉碎了叛乱集团以后，无论汉藏两民族的团结和藏族人民的内部团结，一定会大大加强，在这个基础上，西藏必将逐步走上繁荣进步的光明大道。
    西藏反动集团的叛国活动，一直是在帝国主义者的支持下进行的。在3月10日拉萨叛乱发生以后，帝国主义者曾经以为，他们梦想已久的所谓“西藏独立”这一下将成为事实了。因此他们就大喊大叫，为西藏叛国集团助威。然而，好景不常，人民解放军迅速平定了拉萨地区的叛乱。于是，帝国主义和外国反动派就集中宣传火力攻击人民中国。美国国务院接连发表了几次声明，污蔑中国政府破坏关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，说什么中国要“摧毁宗教和政治自治”，并且假惺惺地“对于处于这种野蛮干涉下的西藏人民”“寄予深切的同情”。人们记得，八年以前，当中国中央人民政府同西藏地方政府达成关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的时候，美国和其他国家的反动派曾经大肆攻击这个协议。现在，他们摇身一变，却又成为这个决议的捍卫者了。这是一个多大的讽刺！美国国务院的诬蔑是不值一驳的，因为破坏关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的、不要西藏实行民族自治的，并不是中央人民政府，恰恰是为美帝国主义和外国反动派支持和怂恿的西藏反动集团。甚至美国国务院的发言人也不能不说，美国从来不认为西藏是一个独立的国家。西藏的叛乱和叛乱的平定完全是中国的内政，任何外国不得干涉纯属中国内政的西藏叛乱事件。大家知道，著名的五项原则，即互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处，是首先由我国同我国的伟大的友好邻邦印度在1954年4月29日关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中提出的。同年6月，我国周恩来总理和印度尼赫鲁总理又发表联合声明，庄严地宣布这五项原则是指导中印两国关系的基本原则。从那时以来，这五项原则也是中国和亚非国家、特别是与西南邻国相处的共同原则。我们很高兴地看到，在西藏叛乱发生后，印度总理尼赫鲁在3月23日发表了不干涉中国内政的声明。我们相信，中印两国政府将继续忠实地遵守五项原则，不允许我们两国的友好关系受到损害。
