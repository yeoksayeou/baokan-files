Repairing Ditches and Draining Water in the Rain

Just as the east was beginning to light up, a dense crowd of people had already appeared in a field of three wheat crops belonging to the Second Squad of the Sixth Brigade of the San Guan People's Commune in Fengxian County, Shanghai, repairing drainage ditches. This squad has two small teams, and there is a severe shortage of male labor. Recently, the squad leader and team leader went to open a river, and the instructor is at a four-level cadre meeting in the county. Production at home is temporarily without leadership, and the commune members are very anxious. At this time, Ping Baoyun, a female commune member from the first team, and Chen Xiuzhen, from the second team, said: "Everyone shares the heavy burden. If the cadres are not at home, we'll do it ourselves." After saying that, they volunteered to lead twenty-eight women from the two teams in a joint battle to vigorously manage the fields. They left for work early and stopped late, urging people to work every day and taking the lead in hard work, which moved all the women and promoted the production of the entire squad.

In recent days, it has been raining continuously. The production army led by the two female commune members is in high spirits, repairing drainage ditches in the rain. By February 17, the water ditches of 129 mu of three wheat crops and 29 mu of rapeseed had all been cleared.

    冒雨修沟排水
    东方刚亮，上海市奉贤县三官公社六大队二中队的一块三麦田里，已出现了黑压压的人群，正在整修排水沟。这个中队共有两个小队，男劳力很缺乏。最近，中队长和小队长开河去了，指导员在县里开四级干部会，家中生产，一时无人领导，社员们心里很着急。这时，一小队的女社员平宝云和二小队的陈秀珍说：“千斤担子大家挑，干部不在家，我们自己搞。”说罢，自告奋勇，带领两个小队二十八个妇女联合作战，大搞田间管理。她们早出工，晚停工，每天催工喊人，带头苦干，感动了全体妇女，并推动了整个中队的生产。
    连日来，阴雨连绵，两位女社员带领的生产大军，士气高昂，冒雨修排水沟。到2月17日为止，一百二十九亩三麦和二十九亩油菜的水沟，已全部通畅。
