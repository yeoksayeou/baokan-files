Seeing Rockets at the Exhibition
By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

For many centuries, people have fantasized about exploring the mysteries of the universe. Only in socialist Soviet Union was the first cosmic flight truly realized. After successfully launching three artificial earth satellites, the Soviet Union launched the world's first cosmic rocket on January 2 this year. This rocket has become an artificial planet in the solar system, orbiting the sun in an elliptical orbit. The Soviet cosmic rocket's flight into space shows that the Soviet Union is at the forefront of the world in the most advanced and important scientific sector—rocket technology, leaving capitalist countries far behind.

How was this significant achievement attained?

The reporter visited the Science Exhibition Hall of the recently opened Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition, where various exhibits are displayed: rockets, artificial satellites, precision instruments for high-altitude scientific research, and various scientific and technological devices related to the development of rocket technology. These valuable exhibits in the exhibition hall tell us in detail the process of Soviet rocket technology development.

The exhibition hall first took us to the distant past.

...As early as 1607-1627, when Tsarist Russia began manufacturing war cannons, the cannon maker O. Mikhailov made Russian rockets, called "shells that can fly and run by themselves." In 1608, a workshop for making rockets appeared. It wasn't until 1820 that a Russian gunner named Zasyadko created gunpowder rockets for combat, weighing four kilograms. This earliest rocket model was displayed, its appearance being a soldier wearing a uniform and military cap. The rocket was divided into three parts: the head was the warhead, the body was the explosive, and the lower part, the feet, were wooden supports and a fuse. When launched, it was placed on a wooden frame and could fly four kilometers high. Later, after almost half a century, the famous Russian inventor and revolutionary, Kibalchich, proposed the world's first manned rocket device plan.

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), the founder of cosmonautics who lived in the era of the Great October Revolution, made great contributions to the development of rocket technology. He was the first in the world to propose the principle of using liquid fuel in rockets and to create the principle of using multi-stage rockets to escape the earth's gravity. He painstakingly designed a rocket device. This airship-style rocket aroused special interest among the audience in the exhibition hall. But Tsiolkovsky's rocket research suffered the same fate as other earlier research: his monumental work "Research on Cosmic Flight Using Jet Propulsion Devices" was torn up in the market to wrap fresh fish, and his spacecraft designs only aroused unreasonable ridicule in the Tsarist Russian court.

Russian scientists have made glorious contributions to the development of rocket technology, but the true emphasis and great development of rocket technology came during the Soviet era. In the early days of the October Revolution, when war and famine threatened the young Soviet regime, Lenin personally instructed that patriotic scientists should be taken care of. Just as fourteen foreign armed interventionists attempted to strangle the people's regime, Lenin suggested establishing new scientific research institutions. As soon as the flames of war subsided, a large number of worker-peasant cadres were transferred to study and engage in future scientific research. In 1929, the first Soviet Rocket Engine Research Institute was built in Leningrad. Recorded materials tell us that a new generation of scientists with strong wills, under the correct leadership of the Party, overcame countless difficulties and went through countless failures, and finally created the first Soviet liquid rocket engine in 1930. This rocket engine is also on display, it is less than one meter long, and the combustion chamber made of special steel is only the size of a fist, with about a dozen brass propellant supply systems around the chamber wall. On August 17, 1933, the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket made on the basis of this engine research took to the sky. A replica of this firstborn of rocket technology is also on display. Its length is 2.46 meters, its total weight at launch is 20 kilograms, its thrust is 65 kilograms, and the altitude it reached is 4.5 kilometers. This victory greatly encouraged scientific workers. Between 1933 and 1940, the Rocket Engine Research Institutes in Leningrad and Moscow successfully created twelve types of rocket engines and rockets, all of which are on display.

During this period, Soviet rocket technology experience was quickly extended to other aviation industry sectors. For example, in 1940, aircraft pilot Fedorov trial-produced the first glider using rocket jet propulsion. On May 15, 1942, the first liquid-fueled rocket plane took off under the pilotage of Bakhchivandzhi. In addition, the "Katyusha" rocket artillery, which severely punished the fascist bandits and shook the world during the Soviet Patriotic War, is well known.

After the war, under the leadership of the Party and the government, Soviet rocket technology developed rapidly, and rocket technology research embarked on a new path. During this period, the Soviet Union made powerful, high-payload single-stage rockets, multi-stage rockets, intercontinental ballistic rockets, cosmic rockets, and so on. The many advanced rocket technology instruments displayed in the exhibition hall convincingly show that the successful manufacturing and launching of Soviet cosmic rockets and artificial satellites is not merely a new achievement in science and technology, but a comprehensive crystallization of advanced Soviet industrial technology and science and technology: radio, remote control, computing, metallurgy, chemistry, semiconductors, thermodynamics, automation technology, and other new achievements, and it is also a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system.

The replicas of the three artificial satellites displayed in the main hall of the exhibition hall attract crowds of visitors.

On the other side of the exhibition hall, the heads of Soviet A1, A2, A3, and A4 type single-stage geophysical rockets carrying scientific instruments are neatly arranged. They are meeting the audience for the first time, arousing great interest. Each type has two, one of which has not been radiated. Their brand-new outer bodies are painted white or black, and their height almost reaches the roof; the other is the part that has been radiated to an altitude of 100 to 470 kilometers and returned to the ground at a designated location. Due to the differences in radiation altitude and landing speed, these rocket head shells have undergone high-heat friction, just like being burned by a raging fire. Especially the A3 type rocket head, which loaded one and a half tons of high-altitude ionosphere, atmospheric pressure and other research instruments last year, flew to an altitude of 452 kilometers, creating a world record for the payload and launch altitude of single-stage rockets. At that time, United Press International also had to admit that Washington believed "the Russians have once again won the championship in one aspect." This A3 type single-stage geophysical rocket flew to the predetermined altitude, and the rocket head automatically detached, overcoming the difficult-to-overcome atmospheric friction and returning to the ground. We saw all the displayed returned parts of the single-stage rockets, even the A3 type special one, its "tried and tested" special steel shell was burnt black, the small hardwood embedded in the small window of the rocket was burned into charcoal, and the special rubber cloth wrapped around the rocket's automatic switch interface only left a layer of burnt residue, but the rocket's huge bright red inner structure and the outer shell steel plate, which was not as thick as imagined, were safe and sound. At the tail of this rocket, four thick special-made ropes are dragged out, connecting a snow-white double-layer parachute made of synthetic fiber. When the rocket head automatically detached at an altitude of 473 kilometers, it automatically inverted and descended freely in the air at a speed of 150 to 250 meters per second. At four kilometers above the ground, the first parachute on top automatically opened, reducing the rocket's descent speed to 60 meters per second. At only 1.5 kilometers above the ground, the second parachute with an area of 700 square meters automatically opened, so the rocket safely descended to the ground at a speed of only 6 meters per second. Various single-stage rockets are launched according to different research projects. Some carry dogs, and some carry various precision instruments such as air pressure, ions, the earth's magnetic field, and cosmic rays. The launch of these rockets has provided valuable scientific data for mankind to fly out of the earth and explore the organization of high altitude and earth materials.

The current Soviet rocket technology has reached a high level of development. Whether in intercontinental ballistic rockets, cosmic rockets, single-stage or multi-stage rocket technology, it surpasses any capitalist country and ranks first in the world. The Soviet Union's powerful rocket technology is benefiting mankind and is a strong pillar for defending world peace.

The exhibition hall gave us a strong belief that relying on highly developed rocket technology, the Soviet Union will launch "permanent" artificial satellites in fixed positions in the near future, launch powerful cosmic rockets to the moon and other planets closest to the earth, solve the problem of satellite return to the ground, and manufacture and launch interstellar scientific research stations. Inspired by the Seven-Year Plan for building communism, Soviet scientific workers, technical experts, and workers are working together to realize mankind's ideal of interstellar flight by rocket.

    展览会上看火箭
    本报记者　戴枫
    许多世纪以来，人们就幻想着探索宇宙的奥秘。只有在社会主义的苏联才真正实现了第一次的宇宙飞行。在成功地发射了三颗人造地球卫星之后，苏联又在今年1月2日发射了世界上第一个宇宙火箭。这只火箭已经成为太阳系的一个人造行星，正在围绕太阳的椭圆形轨道上运行。苏联宇宙火箭上天，表明苏联在最先进、最重要的科学部门——火箭技术上已居世界首位，它把资本主义国家远远地抛在后面了。
    这个具有重大意义的成就是怎样得来的呢？
    记者参观了最近开幕的苏联国民经济成就展览会的科学展览馆，这儿展出了各种展品：火箭、人造卫星、高空科学研究精密仪器，以及与发展火箭技术有关的各种科学技术装置。展览馆中这些宝贵的展品详细地告诉了我们苏联火箭技术发展的过程。
    展览馆首先把我们带到了遥远的过去。
    ……还在1607—1627年间，当沙皇俄国开始制造战炮的时候，制炮匠奥·米哈伊洛夫就制出了俄罗斯火箭，称为“自己能飞能跑的炮弹”。1608年出现了制造火箭的作坊。直到1820年，有个叫卓霞德科的俄罗斯炮手，制成了作战用的火药火箭，重四公斤。这个最早的火箭模型陈列了出来，它的外形是一个穿制服戴军帽的士兵。火箭分三部分：头部是弹头，身体是炸药，下部双脚为木头支点和引火线。发射时架在木架上，能飞四公里高。后来，差不多又经过了半个世纪，俄罗斯著名的发明家、革命家基巴里吉格提出了世界上第一个载人的火箭装置方案。
    生活在伟大十月革命时代的宇宙飞行奠基者——齐奥尔科夫斯基（1857—1935年）对发展火箭技术作出了巨大的贡献。他是世界上第一个提出火箭利用液体燃料原理，并创立了为摆脱地球引力的宇宙速度而利用多级火箭的原理。他费尽心机设计出了一个火箭装置。这个大气艇式的火箭在展览馆里引起了观众们特别的兴趣。但是齐奥尔科夫斯基的火箭研究正与早先其他的研究遭到同样的命运：他的巨著“利用喷气装置作宇宙飞行研究”被撕烂在市场上包鲜鱼，他的飞船设计也只引起了沙皇俄国宫廷中的一片无理嘲笑。
    俄国科学家对发展火箭技术有着光荣的贡献，但火箭技术的真正被重视和得到巨大发展，这还是在苏维埃政权时代。十月革命初期，当战争、饥饿威胁着年青的苏维埃时，列宁亲自指示要照顾爱国的科学家。正当十四个外国武装干涉者企图扼杀人民政权时，列宁建议建立新的科学研究机构。战火刚熄，大批工农干部就被抽调去学习、从事未来的科学研究。1929年，列宁格勒建起了第一所苏联火箭发动机研究所。记载的材料告诉着我们：意志坚强的新一代的科学家，在党的正确领导下，克服了无数困难和经过了无数次的失败，终于在1930年制出了苏联第一架液体火箭发动机。这个火箭发动机也被陈列出来，它全长不到一公尺，特种钢制成的燃烧室只有拳头一般大，室壁四周是十来个黄铜推进剂供应系统。1933年8月17日，在这个发动机研究的基础上制成的苏联第一个液体燃料火箭飞上了天。这个火箭技术的头生子复制品也展了出来。它的长度为二点四六公尺，发射时总重量为二十公斤，推力为六十五公斤，飞到的高度为四点五公里。这个胜利大大鼓舞了科学工作者。就在1933年到1940年间，列宁格勒与莫斯科两地的火箭发动机研究所成功地制出了十二种火箭发动机和火箭，这些东西也都陈列了出来。
    这期间，苏联火箭技术经验很快地推广到其他航空工业部门。譬如，1940年时，飞机驾驶员费多罗夫试制成第一架利用火箭喷气的滑翔机。1942年5月15日，第一架液体燃料火箭飞机在巴赫吉万日驾驶下，腾空而起。此外，在苏联卫国战争期间，严惩法西斯匪军、威振世界的“卡秋莎”火箭炮，已是众所周知的了。
    战后，在党和政府的领导下，苏联的火箭技术飞速地发展，火箭技术研究走上了崭新的道路。这期间，苏联制成了推进功率强大、载负量极大的一级火箭、多级火箭、洲际弹道火箭、宇宙火箭，等等。展览馆陈列出的许许多多最先进的火箭技术仪器令人信服地表明：苏联宇宙火箭和人造卫星的制造和发射成功，不单纯是科学技术上的新成就，这是先进的苏联工业技术和科学技术：无线电、远距离控制、计算学、冶金、化学、半导体、热力学、自动化技术等等新成就的综合结晶，这也是社会主义制度优越性的具体表现。
    展览馆正厅里还展出了三颗人造卫星的复制品，吸引着成群的观众。
    在展览馆大厅的另一面整齐地排放着苏联A1、A2、A3、A4型一级地球物理火箭载运科学仪器的头部。它们是第一次和观众们见面，引起了观众们很大的兴趣。每一种类型都有两个，其中一个是未经放射过的，它们崭新的外身漆着白色或黑色，高度几乎达到屋顶；另一个是已经放射到高空一百至四百七十多公里又按规定地点返回地面的部分。由于放射高度和降落时速度的差异，这些火箭头部外壳经过高热摩擦，正如烈火烧过一样。尤其是A3型火箭头部，它在去年装载了一吨半重的高空电离子、大气压等研究仪器，飞到了四百五十二公里的高空，创造了一级火箭载重和发射高度世界纪录。当时合众国际社也不得不承认：华盛顿认为“俄国人又在一个方面夺得了冠军”。这只A3型一级地球物理火箭飞到预定的高度，火箭头部自动脱落，克服了不易克服的大气摩擦力，返回地面。我们看到所有陈列出来的一级火箭返回部分，就算A3型特别，它那“久经考验”的特种钢外壳混身烧得漆黑，嵌在火箭小窗口上的小坚木，外边烧成了炭，包在火箭自动开关接口处的特种橡胶布，只留下烧得稀烂的一层了，但是火箭庞大的鲜红色的内层结构和那并不是想像中那样厚的外壳钢板却安然无恙。在这只火箭的尾部，拖出四根很粗的特种制品的绳子，连结着一个雪白的合成纤维制成的双层降落伞。当火箭头部在四百七十三公里的高空自动脱落时，自动倒置过来，以每秒一百五十到二百五十公尺的速度自由地凌空下降。在离地面四公里时，顶上第一个降落伞自动敞开了，把火箭降落速度减低到每秒六十公尺，在离地面只有一公里半时，第二个面积达七百平方公尺的降落伞自动敞开，于是火箭只以每秒六公尺的速度安全下降到地面。多种的一级火箭是根据不同的研究项目而发射的，它们有的带着狗，有的带着气压、电离子、地球磁场、宇宙线等各种精密仪器。这些火箭的发射为人类飞出地球、探明高空组织和地球物质等方面提供了宝贵的科学资料。
    目前的苏联火箭技术已有了高度的发展。不论在洲际弹道火箭、宇宙火箭、一级或多级火箭技术方面都超过了任何资本主义国家，居世界第一位。苏联强大的火箭技术正在为人类造福，它是保卫世界和平的有力支柱。
    展览馆给了我们一个强烈的信念：苏联依靠高度发展的火箭技术，在不久的将来，将发射巩固方位的“永久”性人造卫星，发射强大的宇宙火箭到月球和其他离地球最近的行星上去，解决卫星返回地面问题，制造与发射星际科学研究站。为建设共产主义的七年计划所鼓舞的苏联科学工作者、技术专家和工人们，正在同心协力地为实现人类乘坐火箭作星际飞行的理想而奋斗着。（附图片）
