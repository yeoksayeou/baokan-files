Jiangxi Folk Songs

    Cadres Go Up the Mountains
  Yesterday, the mountain areas were desolate,
  Today, the mountain areas are bustling;
  It's not divine soldiers descending from heaven,
  It's Communist Party cadres coming to the mountain ridges.
    Cadres Reclaim Wasteland
  Since Pangu separated heaven and earth thousands of years ago,
  The past cannot compare to today,
  Cadres go up the mountains to reclaim wasteland,
  Layer upon layer, mountain slopes become terraced fields.
    Mountain Gullies Must Become Gold and Silver Nests
  New things abound in the new society,
  Cadres are sent down to the mountain gullies,
  The hoe is the pen, the mountain is the paper,
  Writing full of articles on the hillside.
    × × ×
  Heroes are not afraid of thorns,
  Heroes are not afraid of tiger and wolf dens,
  Labor can change the mountains and rivers,
  Mountain gullies must become gold and silver nests.

    江西民歌
    干部上山
  昨日山区多荒凉，
  今日山区闹洋洋；
  不是神兵从天降，
  共产党的干部来到山岗上。
    干部垦荒
  盘古开天几千年，
  过去难以比今天，
  干部上山开荒地，
  层层山坡变梯田。
    山沟要变金银窝
  新社会里新事多，
  干部下放进山窝，
  锄头是笔山是纸，
  写满文章在山坡。
    ×　×　×
  英雄不怕荆棘多，
  英雄不怕虎狼窝，
  劳动能把山河改，
  山沟要变金银窝。
