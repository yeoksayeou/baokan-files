Title: "If you don't go to Wenshu Monastery, you won't see the face of Huangshan"

Last winter, I traveled on business to southern Anhui and passed by Huangshan. Huangshan is one of China's famous mountains, displaying myriad sights. The local comrades advised us to take a trip up the mountain, but we had to hurry on, so we just climbed a small hillside and considered it a visit to Huangshan. The comrade said, "We have a saying here: 'If you don't go to Wenshu Monastery, you won't see the face of Huangshan,' and 'If you don't climb Tiandu Peak, the trip is all for naught.' Climbing just one hillside doesn't even capture the face of Huangshan, so how can you say you've been to Huangshan?"

Reading and working, I think, are like climbing Huangshan. Taking myself as an example, I've touched the edges of many books, flipped through a few pages, and then thought I'd read them, but I haven't studied them in depth. Therefore, I often don't understand what the book is really about or its essence. It's just like passing by Huangshan, climbing a hillside and then moving on. Did I reach Wenshu Monastery and see the face of Huangshan? No. When others ask, I proudly think I've been to Huangshan, but in truth, heaven only knows what Huangshan really looks like!

It's the same with work. Some work has been done, it's been grasped at, it's been touched, but the key wasn't seized, and there wasn't that spirit of fearing no difficulties or obstacles. Therefore, the problem wasn't solved, and often it's as if nothing was done. It's like "If you don't climb Tiandu Peak, the trip is all for naught." Tiandu Peak is a main peak of Huangshan, overlooking the entire mountain. The climb is extremely treacherous. As the saying goes, "Risk your life to climb Tiandu," and one cannot ascend without the perseverance and courage to brave hardship and danger. In our various tasks, there are also "Tiandu Peaks," but we sometimes avoid them or simply sigh at the sight of the mountain. Although the work is done, touched, the main problem isn't solved, and we retreat in the face of difficulty.

Learning without thorough understanding is like not learning at all; grasping without firmness is like not grasping at all. Passing by Huangshan, Wenshu Monastery and Tiandu Peak can be skipped, but in learning and work, we must have the spirit of "reaching Wenshu Monastery and climbing Tiandu Peak."

### “不到文殊院，不见黄山面”

    “不到文殊院，不见黄山面”
    去冬出差皖南，路过黄山。黄山是我国名山之一，气象万千。当地的同志劝我们上山一游，我们还要赶路，只是爬上一个小山坡浏览一下就算到过黄山了。那个同志说：“我们这里有句俗话：‘不到文殊院，不见黄山面’，‘不都峰，来了一场空’，只爬一个山坡，连黄山的面都没有照，怎么就能说到了黄山呢？”
    读书，做工作，我看也如爬黄山一样。拿我自己来说，许多书也挨了个边，翻过几页，就认为自己读过了，但就是学得不深，因此，书里到底讲些什么，其精神实质如何，却往往弄不清楚。正好像从黄山边上经过一样，爬了一个山坡就过去了，是否到了文殊院，见了黄山面呢？没有。别人问起来，还很得意地认为自己到过黄山；其实，黄山到底是个什么样子，真是天知道！
    拿做工作也是一样。有些工作也做了，也抓了，也都摸了一下，但工作没有抓住关键，而且缺乏那种不畏一切困难险阻的精神。因此并未解决问题，常常是做了等于没有做。正像是“不上天都峰，来了一场空”天都峰是黄山的一个主峰，俯瞰全山，爬上去路途非常险阻，有云：
  “舍命登天都”，没有不畏艰难险阻的毅力和勇气是上不去的。在我们的各项工作中，也有“天都峰”，但我们有时却避开了，或者望山兴叹一番。工作虽然做了，摸了，但并没有解决主要的问题，遇难而退。
    学而不透，等于没学；抓而不紧，等于不抓。路过黄山，文殊院和天都峰可以不去，但在学习和工作上，却必须要有“到文殊院，上天都峰”的精神。
