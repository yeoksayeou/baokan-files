    Forever Be a Promoter of Electric Furnace Workers
    Liu Hongxi, Foreman of the No. 1 "Red Star Youth Furnace" at Dalian Steel Plant
    For several years, all the workers of the No. 1 electric furnace at the Dalian Steel Plant, with the spirit of continuous revolution, have been engaged in unremitting struggle to improve the utilization coefficient of the electric furnace. Since 1955, the utilization coefficient has gradually increased from 14.245 to 32.294 in 1958. The utilization coefficient in the first quarter of this year has also increased, and the national plan has been fully completed nine days ahead of schedule, maintaining a leading position in the whole plant and the whole country. Therefore, it has recently been awarded the honorary title of "Red Star Youth Furnace" by the factory Party committee.
    The reason why our No. 1 furnace can achieve such results is, first of all, that under the continuous education of the Party, all the workers have further realized the great significance of steel production and devoted all their energy to the battle in front of the furnace. In production, we always adhere to the attitude of "learning from others' strengths and making up for our own weaknesses." The three shifts of workers are closely united and actively learn new technologies, so that the utilization coefficient of the electric furnace increases year by year. Now, the new technologies that we apply more skillfully and effectively, such as carbon steel furnace external deoxidation and desulfurization, and "three gas" (oxygen, gas, electricity) steelmaking, are the result of flexibly applying advanced experience. Last year, the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel, further mobilized our enthusiasm. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, the workers of our No. 1 furnace launched a red flag competition between shifts and furnaces. Comrade Liu Feng, Secretary of the Factory Party Committee and Director of the Factory, came to our furnace to supervise the battle in person and worked with the workers, which gave us great education and encouragement. Last year's utilization coefficient increased by 10.533 compared with 1957, such a high rate of increase is unprecedented.
    In production, we not only firmly grasp the key links to improve the utilization coefficient and increase steel production, but also pay great attention to quality. In the first quarter of this year, according to the raw material situation, we boldly changed the high-temperature slagging and oxygen blowing in the reduction period to low-temperature slagging and oxygen blowing in the reduction period, which not only ensured the quality but also increased the output. The factory leaders attached great importance to this reform, gave us great support, and revised the original operating procedures, which played a certain role in the factory's early completion of the first quarter's production tasks. The No. 1 electric furnace was imported from the Soviet Union, and the equipment conditions are better. In addition, the machine repair workers of our factory have continuously improved it over the years, expanding the furnace chamber and increasing the furnace charge. They also creatively adopted the method of exchanging furnace bodies, which greatly shortened the furnace's maintenance time and improved the operating rate. Therefore, the improvement of the utilization coefficient of the No. 1 electric furnace is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union.
    In long-term production practice, we have deeply realized that advanced indicators are always the driving force for progress. In the past few years, the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces has been continuously improved, and there are more and more new technologies. Production has not only not reached the top, but on the contrary, the road to steelmaking production has become wider and wider, and the potential for increasing production has become greater and greater. Improving the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces and increasing the production of more high-quality steel is our bounden duty. We must firmly remember the golden words taught by the Party: "Modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one lag behind." We must guard against arrogance and rashness, always be promoters of electric furnace workers, hold the red flag higher, and strive to complete the 18 million tons of steel this year.

    永远做电炉工人促进派
    大连钢厂一号“红星青年炉”炉长　刘洪喜
    我们大连钢厂一号电炉的全体工人，几年以来，以不断革命的精神，为提高电炉的利用系数，进行着坚持不懈的斗争。从1955年以来，利用系数由14.245逐步提高到1958年的32.294。今年第一季度的利用系数又有了提高，并且提前九天全面完成了国家计划，在全厂以及全国一直保持了领先地位。因此，最近得到了厂党委授予的“红星青年炉”的光荣称号。
    我们一号炉所以能得到这样的成绩，首先是全体工人在党的不断教育下，进一步认识到钢铁生产的伟大意义，把全部精力投入了炉前的战斗。在生产中，我们始终抱着“取人之长、补己之短”的态度，三班工人紧密团结，积极学习新技术，使电炉利用系数一年比一年提高。现在我们应用得比较熟练、效果显著的新技术如炭素钢炉外脱氧、脱硫，“三气”（氧气、煤气、电气）炼钢等等，都是灵活地应用先进经验的结果。去年，党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和生产一千零七十万吨钢的战斗号召，更把我们的积极性调动起来了。我们一号炉的工人在厂党委的领导下，开展了班与班、炉与炉之间的红旗竞赛。厂党委书记兼厂长刘锋同志到我们炉子来亲临督战，并和工人一起劳动，更给了我们很大的教育和鼓励。去年的利用系数一下子比1957年提高了10.533；这样高幅度的增长，是空前未有的。
    在生产中，我们不仅紧紧地掌握了提高利用系数、增加钢产量的环节，而且也十分注意质量。今年第一季度，根据原料的情况，我们大胆地把高温出渣、还原期不准吹氧改为低温出渣、还原期吹氧，这样，既保证了质量也增加了产量。厂领导十分重视这一改革，给我们很大的支持，并修改了原来的操作规程，这对全厂提前完成第一季度生产任务起了一定的作用。一号电炉是苏联进口的，设备条件较好，加上我厂机修工人几年来的不断改进，扩大炉膛，增加装炉量，他们还创造性地采用了互换炉体的办法，大大缩短了炉子的检修时间，提高了作业率。所以，一号电炉利用系数的提高是和苏联的援助分不开的。
    在长期的生产实践中，我们深深地体会到，先进的指标永远是推动前进的动力。几年来电炉利用系数不断提高，新技术也越来越多，生产不但没有到顶，相反地，炼钢生产的道路越走越宽，增产的潜力也越来越大。提高电炉的利用系数，增产更多的优质钢，是我们应尽的义务，我们一定牢牢地记住党所教导的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的金玉良言，戒骄戒躁，永远做电炉工人的促进派，更高地举起红旗，为完成今年一千八百万吨钢而奋斗。
