Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 21st: The Polish Press Agency reported that the resolution of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party "Instructions on the Development of the Polish People's Republic in 1959-1965" has been published here.

The resolution stated: The plan for the development of the Polish national economy in 1959-1965 is the basic program of the Party's activities in the next few years. This plan is a plan for the future work of the people. Its purpose is to comprehensively develop all aspects of Polish life and to build a socialist system that will guarantee a high level of culture and living standards for all working people.

The resolution stated that since the establishment of the people's regime fourteen years ago, Poland has taken a major step towards reaching the level of the most economically developed countries in Europe. Vigorous investment and high-speed industrialization are the foundation of Poland's economic development.

The resolution listed materials on Poland's economic achievements in the past few years and pointed out that the main task of the current Five-Year Plan—to increase real wages and real income of farmers by 30% compared to 1955 by 1960—can be fully realized.

The resolution, in defining the main direction of the national economic plan for 1961-1965, pointed out that in determining the speed of national economic development and the main proportions of creating and distributing national income, it should be taken into account that it is necessary to further realize the country's socialist industrialization, improve productivity, thereby improving the living standards of residents and narrowing the gap between Poland and the highly developed European economies.

The new Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) stipulates that by 1965, industrial output should increase by approximately 50% compared to the planned output of 1960, that is, by approximately 80% compared to 1958, and agricultural production will increase by approximately 20% compared to 1960, that is, by approximately 30% compared to 1958. This will ensure an increase in national income of approximately 40% during this period.

During the Five-Year Plan period, the total amount of investment (including residents' own funds used in residential construction and productive investment in agriculture, etc.) will increase by approximately 49% compared to 1956-1960.

Industrial production will increase by approximately 50% from 1961 to 1965, which means that the output of products in 1965 will be approximately nine times higher than in 1938.

By 1965, the production of some major industrial products is tentatively set as follows: coal—112 million to 113 million tons, electricity—43.5 billion to 45 billion kilowatt-hours, steel—9 million tons, planers—27,000 units.

The agricultural section of the resolution points out that the plan stipulates that the yield per hectare of major agricultural products in 1965 will be as follows: grain—17.5 quintals, potatoes—160 quintals, sugar beets—250 quintals. The resolution also stipulates that in 1965, the number of cattle will increase to 11 million head, and the number of sheep will increase to 16.5 million.

The resolution then discussed the expansion of foreign trade. The commodity circulation volume in 1965 should exceed the level of 1958 by at least 46% (calculated at the planned price ratio in 1959). The resolution emphasized that the structure of commodity imports and exports should be greatly improved: the import of raw materials and semi-finished products should be expanded, and the export of machinery should be increased. The proportion of machinery and equipment in all exports was 27.8% in 1958, and it should be increased to 39% by 1965.

The resolution also noted issues such as employment and improving productivity, wages, education and science, organizing vocational education, and so on.

The resolution said in the part about the material conditions and living standards of residents that the average wage of employees in 1965 should increase by 23% to 25% compared to the 1960 level, and by 33% to 35% compared to the 1958 level. The growth rate of farmers' actual income is roughly the same.

The resolution concluded: Due to overcoming the economic difficulties caused in the past and strengthening domestic political stability, and due to close cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, we have all the internal and external conditions to further successfully build socialism in our country.

The implementation of the current Five-Year Plan and the future 1961-1965 National Economic Development Plan will be a rapid advance on this road.

    缩小同欧洲经济高度发达国家的距离
    进一步实现社会主义工业化提高生产率
    波兰公布今后七年全面发展国民经济的指示
    据新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社报道：这里公布了波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会“关于1959—1965年波兰人民共和国发展的指示”的决议。
    决议说：1959—1965年发展波兰国民经济的计划是党在今后几年中活动的基本纲领。这个计划是人民未来工作的计划，它的目的是为了波兰生活各个方面的全面发展，为了建设社会主义制度，这种制度将保证全体劳动人民高度的文化和生活水平。
    决议说，自人民政权建立十四年来，波兰在达到欧洲经济最发达的国家水平方面迈出了一大步。大力投资和高速度工业化是波兰经济发展的基础。
    决议列举了波兰在过去一些年内所获得的经济成就的材料，并且指出，目前所执行的五年计划的主要任务——到1960年要把实际工资和农民的实际收入比1955年提高30％——可以完全实现。
    决议在规定1961—1965年国民经济计划的主要方向时指出，在决定国民经济发展的速度以及创造和分配国民收入的主要比例时，应当考虑到，必须进一步实现国家社会主义工业化，提高生产力，从而提高居民的生活水平，缩小波兰同欧洲经济高度发达国家之间的距离。
    新的五年计划（1961—1965年）规定：到1965年，工业产量要比1960年的计划产量增长约50％，即比1958年增长约80％，农业生产将比1960年提高约20％，即比1958年提高约30％。这样将保证这一时期内的国民收入增加约40％。
    在五年计划期间，投资总额（包括用在住宅建筑方面的居民自己的资金和农业上的生产投资等）约比1956—1960年增加49％。
    1961—1965年工业生产约将提高50％，这就是说，1965年的产品产量约比1938年增加九倍。
    到1965年，一些主要工业产品的生产暂定如下：煤——一亿一千二百万到一亿一千三百万吨，电力——四百三十五亿到四百五十亿度，钢——九百万吨，刨床——两万七千台。
    决议的农业部分中指出，计划规定1965年主要农产品的每公顷单位面积产量如下：谷物——十七点五公担，马铃薯——一百六十公担，甜菜——二百五十公担。决议还规定，1965年牛将增加到一千一百万头，羊增加到一千六百五十万只。
    决议接着谈到对外贸易的扩大。1965年的商品流通额至少应超过1958年水平的46％（按1959年计划比价算）。决议强调指出，应该大力改善商品进口和出口的结构：应该扩大原料和半制成品的进口，同时增加机器的出口。机器和设备在全部输出品中的比重在1958年是27.8％，到1965年要提高到39％。
    决议还注意到就业和提高生产力、工资、教育和科学、组织职业教育等问题。
    决议在关于居民的物质条件和生活水平这一部分中说，1965年职工的平均工资应比1960年水平提高23％到25％，比1958年的水平提高33％到35％。农民实际收入的增长比例大约也是这样。
    决议最后说：由于克服了过去所造成的经济困难和加强了国内的政治稳定，由于同苏联和其他社会主义国家的密切合作，我们具备有一切内部和外部条件来进一步顺利在我国建设社会主义。
    目前的五年计划和未来的1961—1965年发展国民经济计划的执行，将是在这一道路上的一日千里的前进。
