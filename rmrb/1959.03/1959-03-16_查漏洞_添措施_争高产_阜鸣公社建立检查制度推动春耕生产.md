Checking for Loopholes, Adding Measures, Striving for High Yields
Fuming Commune Establishes Inspection System to Promote Spring Planting Production

    Chengdu, March 15 (From Our Newspaper) The Fuming Commune in Nanxi County, Sichuan Province, acting on the spirit of "seizing the initiative from the start and maintaining a tight grip from beginning to end," has mobilized the masses to inspect the implementation of their increased production plans, plugging loopholes and adding measures early to ensure the realization of large-area high-yield plans for 1959.

    The Fuming Commune has 17,000 mu of land. In 1958, its total grain output increased fourfold, with an average yield of 2,253 jin per mu. To ensure that grain production doubles and redoubles on the basis of 1958, the commune carried out several comprehensive and in-depth inspections during the preparations for spring planting. Recently, seizing the crucial opportunity of the start of spring sowing and wheat jointing stage, they mobilized the masses to inspect the implementation of the commune's production and various measures for increasing production. This inspection was based on the requirements of the annual plan, checking whether the measures were adapted to the targets, and inspecting the previous stage of production and the preparations for the next stage. Through the inspection, dozens of loopholes, large and small, were discovered. For example, although the amount of fertilizer accumulated was completed according to the plan, the proportion of concentrated fertilizer did not meet the requirements. After discovering the loopholes, the commune party committee organized the masses to launch a major debate, overcame complacency and paralysis, and proposed many suggestions targeting the loopholes found, such as establishing concentrated fertilizer acceptance teams. After more than a month of implementing these suggestions, most of the loopholes have been plugged, and many additional measures have been added. According to an inspection in early March, 60% of the fertilizer in the commune has been composted, and the standard of concentrated fertilizer has reached 40%. The commune members plan to further develop a fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, ensuring that 150,000 jin of fertilizer are prepared for each mu of land this year. The commune has now set up eight pesticide factories, using poisonous weeds to prepare 400,000 jin of insecticide liquid, and cultivated 49 mu of poisonous weeds. In addition, based on the suggestions of the commune members, they have reduced one-third (800 people) of non-productive personnel and put them into agricultural production.

    To ensure that the plan becomes the actual action of the masses, the Fuming Commune has decided to combine the ten-day inspection with the comprehensive inspections during certain periods such as spring planting and summer harvesting, and to establish it as a system, insisting on "plugging loopholes at all times, and ensuring that no measures are missed," to ensure the realization of this year's increased production plan.

    查漏洞　添措施　争高产
    阜鸣公社建立检查制度推动春耕生产
    本报成都15日电　四川省南溪县阜鸣公社根据“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的精神，发动群众检查增产计划的执行情况，及早堵漏洞、添措施，保证1959年大面积高产计划的实现。
    阜鸣公社有一万七千亩土地，1958年粮食总产量增加四倍，平均亩产二千二百五十三斤。为了保证粮食产量在1958年的基础上番上加番，这个社在备耕中曾先后进行了多次全面深入地大检查，最近又抓住开始春播和小麦拔节的关键时机，发动群众对全社生产和各种增产措施的贯彻情况进行检查。这次检查是根据全年计划的要求，检查措施与指标是否适应，检查前阶段生产和下阶段准备工作。通过检查，大大小小共发现了好几十个漏洞。如积肥的数量虽然按计划完成了，但精肥所占比重不够要求。发现漏洞之后，公社党委便组织群众展开大辩论，克服了自满麻痹思想，针对找到的漏洞，提出了建立精肥验收小组等建议多项，这些建议经过最近一个多月的贯彻执行后，大部分漏洞都已经堵住，并追加了不少措施。据3月上旬检查，全社60％的肥料都经过沤制，精肥标准达到40％，社员们计划进一步开展积肥造肥运动，今年保证为每亩地备下十五万斤肥料。全社现已办起八个农药厂，用毒草泡制了四十万斤杀虫液，并培植了四十九亩毒草。此外，还根据社员建议，压缩了三分之一（八百名）非生产人员，投入农业生产。
    为了使计划成为群众的实际行动，阜鸣公社已决定把按旬检查和春耕、夏收等一定时期的全面大检查结合起来，并定为制度，要坚持做到“时时刻刻堵漏洞、样样措施不落空”，确保今年增产计划的实现。　　　　（王焕斗、周祖佑）
