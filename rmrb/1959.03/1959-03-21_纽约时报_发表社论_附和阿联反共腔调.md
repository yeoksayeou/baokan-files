Xinhua News Agency, 20th: New York dispatch: The "New York Times" published an editorial on the 18th with the same tone as the United Arab Republic authorities, saying: "What worries us most today is the infiltration of communism. Nasser... now finds that the Iraqi Communists are hindering his hope of realizing Arab unity. …The entire concept of Arab nationalism is in danger."
The newspaper slandered the Soviet Union and said in an inflammatory tone: Nasser has lost a battle, and so has the West. Deep thought and vigilance are needed to ensure that the Russians do not win in a major battle.

    “纽约时报”发表社论
    附和阿联反共腔调
    新华社20日讯  纽约消息：“纽约时报”在18日发表一篇同阿联当局一个腔调的社论说：“今天最使我们感到忧虑的是共产主义的渗入。纳赛尔……现在发现伊拉克共产党人阻挠他实现阿拉伯统一的希望。……阿拉伯民族主义的整个概念处在危险中。”
    报纸对苏联进行诬蔑，并且用煽动口吻说：纳赛尔打输了一场战斗，西方也是这样。需要深谋远虑和警惕来保证不使俄国人在一场主要的战斗中获胜。
