March 16th is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Alexander Stepanovich Popov, the outstanding inventor of radio. Radio scientists around the world, as well as all people, commemorate this great scientist with deep gratitude, because with his great genius and lifelong energy he invented radio for mankind, opening a new page in the history of world science and technology.

Alexander Stepanovich Popov was born on March 16, 1859, in the Turinsk mining area of Russia, located in the northern Urals, where most of the local people made a living by mining. From an early age, he loved technology, learned to master machine tools from the workers, could do carpentry and turning work, and was especially good at glass blowing. These skills had a great impact on his later research work. After graduating from middle school in the autumn of 1877, he entered the Department of Physics and Mathematics at St. Petersburg University. At that time, his university life was quite difficult, but his amazing perseverance and fervent desire for knowledge overcame the difficulties in life. To support himself, he worked as an electrician, tutored others, and proofread for newspapers. At school, the young Popov's talent and perseverance were noticed by the professors, and when he was still a fourth-year student, he had already served as a teaching assistant at the school.

After graduating from university in 1882, he became an assistant in the mine officer class of the Kronstadt Electrical Engineering School. This school had a better physics research institute and electrical and magnetic equipment. Popov carried out many effective research works here and published a number of valuable scientific papers. At this time, he invented a special photometer that could make many valuable observations of solar eclipses.

On March 7, 1895, Popov demonstrated the world's first radio receiver, which he had invented after countless research and experiments, at the Physics Department of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society. It was very sensitive and could successfully detect and record electrical oscillations. This historically significant day was later designated as Radio Day.

Although Popov's great inventions did not receive attention and support from the Tsarist authorities, he continued to work tirelessly on his inventions. He improved the receiver and connected telegraph instruments to the improved receiver, creating the world's first radio telegraph.

At the same time, in the following year, he conducted many experiments and observations on maritime radio communications, laying the foundation for radio navigation, direction finding, and positioning.

In 1899, Popov also invented the world's first radio telephone receiver and created the world's first detectors.

In 1901, he was invited to serve as a professor in the Department of Physics at the St. Petersburg Electrical Engineering Institute and received the title of Honorary Electrical Engineer.

Alexander Stepanovich Popov's great and ingenious inventions did not receive support and development due to the conservatism and short-sightedness of the old Russian system. Tense work also affected his health. On January 16, 1906, this great Russian scholar, the brilliant inventor of radio, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, died of a cerebral hemorrhage. This was an irreparable loss to advanced Russian science and to science around the world.

Popov's life, his spirit and perseverance in tirelessly pursuing human scientific endeavors, are worthy of our study. His ingenious inventions have become a treasure of world science, opening up broad avenues for the development of radio electronics and providing great favorable conditions for physics, chemistry, geology, medicine, meteorology, astronomy, and other scientific specialties to reach the highest level.

    波波夫生平简介
    3月16日是杰出的无线电发明家亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫诞生一百周年纪念日。全世界的无线电科学工作者以及所有的人民，都怀着万分感激的心情来纪念这位伟大的科学家，因为他以自己的伟大天才和毕生精力为人类发明了无线电，揭开了世界科学技术历史上新的一页。
    1859年3月16日，亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫生于俄国土耳其斯克矿区，住在乌拉尔北部，当地人民多靠采矿维生，他从小就喜欢技术，跟着工人们学会掌握机床，能做木工、旋工，尤其会吹玻璃，这些对他后来作研究工作起了很大影响。1877年秋中学毕业后，即进入彼得堡大学物理数学系，当时，他的大学生活是相当困难的，但他的惊人的毅力和热烈的求知欲战胜了生活上的困难。为了维持生活，他当过电工、替别人补过课，给报刊当过校对。在学校里，少年的波波夫的天才和毅力很得到教授们的注意，当他还是一个四年级学生的时候，就已在学校中担任助教职务了。
    1882年大学毕业后，到喀琅斯塔得电工学校水雷军官班当助理员。这个学校设有较好的物理研究所以及电学、磁学设备。波波夫在这里进行了许多具有成效的研究工作，发表了一些很有价值的科学论文。这时，他曾发明一种专门的光度计，能对日蚀作很多有价值的观测。
    1895年3月7日，波波夫在俄罗斯物理化学学会物理分会上，表演了他经过无数次研究和试验发明出来的世界上第一部无线电接收机。灵敏度很高，能顺利地发现和记录电振荡。这个具有历史意义的日子，后来即被定为无线电节。
    尽管波波夫的这些伟大的发明没有得着沙皇官厅的重视和支持，但他还是不倦地从事自己的发明。并将接收机加以改进，把电报仪器连接在这个经过改进的接收机上。创造了世界上第一个无线电报。
    同时，他又在以后的一年中，对海上无线电通讯方面作了很多试验和观测，从而为无线电导航、测向、定位等奠定了基础。
    1899年波波夫又发明了世界上第一架无线电话接收机。并且创造了世界上第一批检波器。
    1901年他被邀担任彼得堡电工学院物理系教授，并接受名誉电气工程师的称号。
    亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫伟大天才的发明，由于旧俄制度的保守和鼠目寸光，没有得到支持和发展。紧张的工作也影响着他的健康。1906年1月16日，这位伟大的俄罗斯学者，天才的无线电发明家，亚力山大·斯切潘诺维奇·波波夫患脑溢血与世长辞了。这是先进的俄罗斯科学和全世界科学的一个不可弥补的损失。
    波波夫的一生，他为人类科学事业孜孜不倦地进行的精神和毅力，是值得我们学习的。他天才的发明，成了世界科学的财富，为无线电电子学的发展开辟了广阔的道路，为物理、化学、地质、医学、气象、天文以及其它科学专门，达到最高水平提供了极大的有利条件。
