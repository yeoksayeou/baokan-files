For the Children, and for Others
　　Qin Li

　　I saw a middle-aged couple taking a three or four-year-old child to see a play. As soon as the play started, the child kept pointing at the characters on the stage, asking one by one: Is this a good person? Is that a bad person? After a while, there were always only these few people on stage, and the child was no longer interested; so, the child moved from his father's lap to his mother's lap, and then from his mother's lap to his father's lap. The parents had no choice but to coax the child with candy and biscuits, and they couldn't enjoy the play themselves. When the play reached its climax, the child was already fast asleep in his father's arms.

　　Seeing this kind of scene is not the first time. I can't help but want to say a few words for the children and for the order of the theater.

　　In the greater leap forward, it is indeed pleasant to make good use of cultural breaks and see a good play. Well-meaning parents often think, let the children come along and have some fun. They easily overlook that this will not only disrupt the child's daily routine and affect their health, but also that movies or dramas that children cannot understand may sometimes have a bad influence on them, especially the child's incessant questions, or even the crying and shouting of younger children, which will prevent other comrades from watching attentively, and the good order of the theater cannot be maintained.

　　Theater order is related to the viewing of hundreds, or even thousands, of audience members. For the sake of the children's health, and in order not to hinder more comrades from spending a wonderful moment in the theater, let each of us as audience members, jointly contribute to the good order of the theater!

    为了孩子，也为了别人
    秦犁
    我看到一对中年夫妇，带着一个三、四岁的孩子看戏。戏一开始，孩子不停地指着舞台上的剧中人，一个一个的问：这是好人吗？这是坏人吧？过那么一会儿，台上总是这几人，便引不起孩子更多的兴趣了；于是，孩子一会儿从爸爸身上换到妈妈身上，一会儿又从妈妈身上爬到爸爸身上。爸爸妈妈只好又是糖又是饼的哄着孩子，自己也看不好戏。等戏演到正热闹的时候，孩子也在爸爸臂弯里呼呼的睡起觉来了。
    看到这种情景，已经不是头一回了。不免想为孩子，为剧场的秩序说几句话。
    在更大的跃进中，好好利用文化休息的机会，看一出好戏，这的确是快意的。好心的爸爸妈妈常常会想，让孩子也一起去玩玩吧。他们却容易忽略这不但要破坏孩子的生活常规，影响他们的健康，而且那些孩子看不懂的电影或是戏剧，有时还可能给他们不良影响，特别是孩子罗罗嗦嗦的问话，甚至是更小一些的孩子的哭声、叫声，要妨碍别的同志静心观赏，剧场的良好秩序也没法维持了。
    剧场秩序关系到几百个、甚至上千个观众的观赏。为了孩子的健康，也为了不妨碍更多同志在剧场度过一段美好的时刻，让我们每一个作观众的人，共同来为剧场的良好秩序尽一份力吧！
