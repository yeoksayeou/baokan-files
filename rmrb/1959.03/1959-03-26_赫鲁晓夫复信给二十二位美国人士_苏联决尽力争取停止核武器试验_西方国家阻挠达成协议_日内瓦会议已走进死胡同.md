Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: Soviet Premier Khrushchev said: "The Soviet government now and in the future will make every effort to resolve the urgent task of stopping nuclear weapons tests, because this will be of great significance for resolving the disarmament issue and eliminating the threat of a new war."
    Khrushchev said this in a reply to a letter from twenty-two prominent American politicians, scientists, and industrialists. These Americans had written to Khrushchev, Eisenhower, and Macmillan, urging the heads of government of the three countries to promote an agreement at the ongoing Geneva conference of Soviet, American, and British representatives on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests.
    In his reply, Khrushchev said that the Soviet government believes that concluding an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests is of great significance, and concluding such an agreement would be an important first step on the road to a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    He pointed out that the Soviet government has done a lot of work to make the Geneva conference a success. However, the current Geneva conference has formed a very worrying situation. The American and British delegations not only do not want to reach an agreement to stop nuclear weapons tests, but on the contrary, are doing everything possible to obstruct an agreement on this issue. In fact, the Geneva conference, which has been open for four months, has reached a dead end due to the attitude of Western countries, and there is a danger of it breaking down.
    Khrushchev said that at the beginning of January, the American delegation, on the pretext of obtaining "new seismic data," essentially demanded that the conclusions and recommendations of experts already agreed upon by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain be revised. It is not difficult to see that the purpose of this measure by the American government is to destroy the foundation built by the patient work of authoritative experts from several countries, on which a supervisory system for monitoring the cessation of testing should have been established.
    In his reply, Khrushchev expressed his complete agreement with the view put forward by the American people in their letter that the supervisory system to be formulated by the meeting should be practical and feasible, "able to meet all reasonable requirements." Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's proposals on the supervisory system fully took into account the interests of all contracting parties and stipulated effective supervision of the cessation of testing. The Soviet Union suggested that the supervisory committee should implement a procedure for passing resolutions that would prevent any country from forcing its will on others. The Soviet Union suggested that the supervisory posts and investigation teams should be composed of a mixed international membership, including experts from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and other countries. However, the American and British governments' proposals regarding the procedure for passing resolutions are aimed at making the supervisory bodies subservient to them. In this way, Western countries can force these agencies to pass decisions that suit their wishes and resist any suggestions from the Soviet Union. The United States and Britain insist that Soviet experts should not participate in supervisory posts set up within the Soviet Union, and such supervisory posts could be used to provide false evidence and raise unfounded suspicions. In this case, the supervisory system will only deepen distrust and allow the arms race to continue.
    Khrushchev finally expressed the hope that Western countries would finally adopt a constructive attitude so that an agreement could be reached on the issue of universally and permanently stopping nuclear weapons tests.

    赫鲁晓夫复信给二十二位美国人士
    苏联决尽力争取停止核武器试验
    西方国家阻挠达成协议  日内瓦会议已走进死胡同
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫说：“苏联政府现在和今后都要尽一切努力争取解决停止核武器试验这个迫切的任务，因为这对解决裁军问题和消除新战争威胁会有重大的意义”。
    赫鲁晓夫是在一封写给二十二位著名的美国政治家、科学家和实业家的回信中说这些话的。这些美国人士曾写信给赫鲁晓夫、艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦，呼吁三国政府首脑促使目前正在日内瓦举行的苏、美、英三国代表关于停止核武器试验问题的会议达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫在回信中说，苏联政府认为缔结停止核武器试验协定具有重大的意义，缔结这样的协定将是走向全面禁止原子武器和氢武器的道路上的重要的第一步。
    他指出，苏联政府为使日内瓦会议取得成就作了许多工作。但是，目前的日内瓦会议却形成了令人非常担心的局面。美国和英国代表团不仅不想达成停止核武器试验的协议，而是恰恰相反，在竭尽所能地阻挠就这一问题达成协议。实际上，开了四个月的日内瓦会议，由于西方国家的态度，已经走进了死胡同，并且有破裂的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，1月初，美国代表团借口获得了“新的地震材料”，实质上要求修改已经由苏、美、英三国政府同意了的专家的结论和建议。不难看出，美国政府这个措施的目的是要破坏一些国家的权威专家经过耐心的工作所建筑起来的基础，在这个基础上本来是应该建立起监督停止试验的监督制度的。
    赫鲁晓夫在回信中表示完全同意美国人士在来信中提出的这样一个意见：会议所要制定的监督制度应该是切实可行的，“能满足一切合理要求的”。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联关于监督制度的建议充分考虑到了所有缔约国的利益，并且规定了对停止试验的有效监督。苏联建议，在监督委员会内实行这样一种通过决议的程序，它使任何国家都不能强迫别人接受自己的意志。苏联建议，监督岗和调查小组应当由国际性的成员混合组成，其中应包括苏联、美国、英国和其他国家的专家。而美国和英国政府关于通过决议的程序的建议，目的是要使监督机构听命于它们。这样，西方国家就可以硬要这些机构通过合乎它们心意的决定，而抵制苏联的任何建议。美国和英国坚持苏联专家不能参加设在苏联境内的监督岗，这样的监督岗就可能被利用来提供伪证和提出毫无根据的嫌疑。在这种情况下，监督制度只会使不信任加深，使军备竞赛继续下去。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示，希望西方国家终于会采取建设性的态度，使得普遍和永远地停止试验核武器的问题能够达成协议。
