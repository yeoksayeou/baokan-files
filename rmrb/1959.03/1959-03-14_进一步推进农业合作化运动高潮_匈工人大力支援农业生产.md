Xinhua News Agency, Budapest. Amidst the current high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hungary, the working class has enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and is launching a vigorous upsurge of support for agricultural production cooperatives nationwide.

Agricultural machinery factories in various regions have convened production meetings, putting forward various guarantees to overfulfill their tasks and produce more machines for agricultural production. Workers at the Emog Agricultural Machinery Factory in Budapest proposed to produce 150 more modern combine harvesters than planned, and to painstakingly design two new types of combine harvesters. The new combine harvesters will increase work capacity by 30% compared to the old ones.

The Chepel Locomotive Factory in Budapest also proposed to vigorously increase the production of V-28 tractor engines. All the workers of the Red Star Tractor Factory decided to increase the production of 150 tractors and machine parts worth 2 million forints.

Agricultural machinery repair shops will also begin producing a batch of new agricultural machines, including sugar beet and corn planters, pea harvesters, etc. In addition, this factory will provide a large number of equipment to assist the mechanization of livestock sheds in agricultural production cooperatives. Two Gebani brick and tile factories will increase production by three million bricks for agricultural production cooperatives this year.

The Vosh State Construction Industrial Enterprise provided a large number of building materials to the newly established agricultural production cooperatives. Workers in many factories in the Gyor-Sopron region are enthusiastically using their holidays to help the production cooperatives build livestock sheds, install electric lights, and so on.

The Borsod Chemical Combine increased the production of chemical fertilizers by 4,000 tons in the first two months of this year alone. Now the factory has proposed to supply more than 1,500 tons of chemical fertilizers to the countryside every month.

Railway workers are also working hard to assist the socialist transformation of the countryside, proposing to speed up the transportation of chemical fertilizers, seeds and machines to agricultural production cooperatives.

    新华社布达佩斯讯　在当前匈牙利农业合作化运动的高潮中，工人阶级热烈地响应了党的号召，正在全国范围内掀起了一个大力支援农业生产合作社的热潮。
    各地农业机器厂纷纷召开生产会议，提出种种超计划完成任务的保证，为农业生产更多的机器。布达佩斯埃莫格农业机器厂的职工提出要多生产一百五十架现代化的收割机，并且要苦心设计两种新式收割机。新的收割机将比旧的收割机的工作能力提高30％。
    布达佩斯切佩尔机车厂也提出要大力增产V—28号拖拉机发动机。红星拖拉机工厂的全体职工决定要增产一百五十架拖拉机和价值二百万福林的机器零件。
    农业机器修配厂也将开始生产一批新式的农业机器，其中包括糖萝葡和玉米播种机、豌豆收割机等。此外，这个工厂还提供一大批装备来协助农业生产合作社畜舍的机械化。两个盖巴尼砖瓦厂今年将为农业生产合作社增产三百万块砖。
    沃什州建筑工业企业向新成立的农业生产合作社提供了大批的建筑器材。吉厄尔——索普伦州很多工厂的职工正在热情地利用假日帮助各生产合作社建筑畜舍、装备电灯等。
    包尔绍德化学联合工厂仅在今年头两个月内就增产了四千吨的化学肥料。现在该厂又提出每月要为农村多供给一千五百多吨化学肥料。
