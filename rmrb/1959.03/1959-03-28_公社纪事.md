    The Secretary's Experimental Plot
    Anyone who has been to the commune office compound will praise the Party Secretary's experimental plot:
      "Less than half a mu of land, planted with dozens of things, it's really interesting!"
    The Party Secretary's experimental plot is in the yard in front of the office. There is wheat deliberately planted in the summer, dry rice sown like wheat, sunflowers from fraternal countries, newly promoted forage crop of tree kale, yam grafted with moonflower, and apples that supposedly don't grow well here, and sugarcane that has never taken root here... The most interesting thing is a small tea tree about an inch long planted in a broken bowl, which was also moved here from afar. It has only one dark green leaf and a tender yellow bud.
    Whenever the Party Secretary has time, he carefully irrigates and weeds the plot. The soil in the plot is always loose, without even a small weed. The precious tea tree in the broken bowl also often shows signs of having been watered...
    The Party Secretary has a very beautiful and grand ideal. He wants to open up tea gardens and orchards on barren mountains, to produce things that have never been produced here, and to make this not-so-affluent place very affluent.
    The Party Secretary's small experimental plot is a miniature of his ideal. He cultivates his experimental plot and also cultivates his very beautiful and grand ideal...

    New Highways
    The commune has built several new highways. One leads to the county town, one leads to the industrial and mining area, and one leads to the market town. A station has been set up at the intersection of the highways. The bus to the county town has started running.
    The highways were built by the commune's road-building army in a concentrated effort that only took a month. The soldiers collected stones from the mountains, dug up soil from the roadside, and carried yellow sand from the stream. They used extremely simple tools to create this brand new highway.
    The highway station is under a large willow tree.
  A wooden sign with "×× Station" is nailed to the tall trunk. Passengers buy tickets and sit on the soft grass waiting for the bus, smoking, chatting, and looking at the surrounding crops.
    The only person working at this station is a ticket-selling girl. She wears pigtails, dresses smartly, and looks like a clever person. She just graduated from senior primary school and took on this job. She coordinates vehicles, delivers tickets to people's doors, and is quick and efficient. People call her "Stationmaster."
    New highways, new stations, new "stationmaster"... everything is new, everything is growing. Soon, there will be more highways here, proper stations, and experienced stationmasters...

    Children
    On the streets of the commune's market town, I saw children wearing red scarves busily doing a peculiar job: they were squatting on the ground in groups, each holding a small iron shovel (ha! actually a wok shovel!), scraping up the black mud from the road surface and corners of the walls piece by piece, then putting the black mud into small bamboo baskets, and when the small bamboo baskets were full, they were poured into large baskets. They quickly accumulated several large baskets. This black, oily, delicate, and solid "thousand-foot mud" is a very good fertilizer.
    Not long ago, I also saw "Young Pioneers" working on the road construction site. Each of them held a small iron hammer, knocking pieces of broken brick into walnut-sized pieces, so that the road-building army had enough materials to pave the highway. The children hammered with great energy and seriousness. The bricks they knocked out were almost the same size, and every piece was up to standard.
    Long ago, in the hot summer, I also saw children holding basins, pots, and cans, carrying buckets and wooden ladles, marching in long lines towards the drought-stricken fields. They used the lightest water-carrying tools to participate in the struggle to fight drought and save seedlings.
    Here, children participate in various battles. They are learning to be successors to socialism and communism.

    The Old Basket Weaver
    The commune has set up a home for the elderly: the tiled houses have been repaired to be brand new, the walls have been whitewashed to be snow-white, and the beds have been arranged neatly...
    The more than seventy-year-old basket weaver of the handicraft cooperative has excellent skills and works cleanly and efficiently. However, whenever he has time, he stands outside the gate of the home for the elderly, staring blankly, lost in thought.
    The commune cadres thought that the old man must be envious of the life in the home for the elderly and wanted to enter the home.
    One day, when the old man was standing at the gate of the home for the elderly again, staring blankly, the cadre chatted with the old man.
    The old basket weaver said: "I like the home for the elderly. I have lived for more than seventy years, and I have never seen such a good place. This is really something new!"
    The old basket weaver said: "Now, let those who should go in go in first. I can still work. When I can't work anymore, I will enter this gate..."
    The old basket weaver said: "Hey, by then, the home for the elderly will definitely be better than it is now!"
    The old basket weaver laughed innocently, his eyes narrowed into a slit, and his withered mouth opened wide.
    The cadre also laughed. At this time, he understood the old basket weaver...

    公社纪事

    书记的试验田
    到过公社办公大院的人，都会啧啧称赞党委书记的试验田：
      “不到半亩地，种了几十样东西，真是有意思！”
    党委书记的试验田就在办公室前面的院子里。这里有故意改在夏天栽种的小麦，有像麦子一样播种的旱稻，有从兄弟国家来的向日葵，有新推广的饲料作物牛皮菜，有嫁接月光花的山芋，还有据说这里长不好的苹果和从未在这里落脚过的甘蔗……最有趣的是一个破碗里栽着的一棵寸把长的小茶树，它也是从远地搬到这里来落户的。它只有一片深绿的叶子和一颗嫩黄的芽苞。
    党委书记一有时间就在地里细心灌溉，细心除草。地里的泥土总是松软的，连一棵小小的杂草都没有。那个破碗里的宝贝茶树也经常有浇过水的痕迹……
    党委书记有他的很美很美的理想。他要在荒山上开辟茶园、果园，要在这里生产从未出产过的东西，更使这个不够富庶的地方变得非常富庶。
    党委书记的小小试验田，是他的理想的一部分缩影。他培育着他的试验田，也培育着他的很美很美的理想……
    新的公路
    公社新建了几条公路。一条通县城，一条通工矿区，一条通集镇。在公路的交叉点，设了一个站头。通县城的班车开始通车了。
    公路是公社的筑路大军只花一个来月的时间突击建成的。战士们从山上采下石块，从路边挖起泥土，从溪边挑来黄沙。他们用极其简陋的工具造成了这条崭新的公路。
    公路的站头在一棵大柳树下，
  “××站”的木牌钉在高高的树干上。乘客买了票，就在软绵绵的草地上坐着候车，一面吸烟，一面聊天，一面看四周的庄稼。
    为这个车站工作的，只有一个卖票的姑娘。她梳着双辫，穿着灵小的衣裳，一看就知道是个机灵人，她刚从高小毕业就担任了这个工作。她联系车辆，送票上门，腿勤手快，人们都叫她“站长”。
    新的公路，新的站头，新的“站长”……一切都是新的，一切都在成长。不久，这里将有更多的公路，将有像样的车站，将有老练的站长……
    孩子们
    在公社集镇的街道上，我看见系着红领巾的孩子们起劲地做着一种奇特的工作：他们东一伙西一伙地蹲在地上，每人手里拿一把小小铁铲（哈！原来是锅铲！），把路面、墙角的黑泥一片片地铲起来，然后把黑泥装在小竹篮里，小竹篮满了，又倒到大箩筐里。他们很快就积起了好几箩筐。这种黑油油的、又细腻又坚实的“千脚泥”，是一种很好的肥料。
    不久以前，我还看见“红领巾”们在筑路工地劳动。他们每人手里拿一把小铁捶，把一块块断砖敲成核桃大小的砖块，让筑路大军有足够的铺筑公路的材料。孩子们敲得真起劲，真认真，他们敲出的砖块，几乎一般大小，块块合格。
    很久以前，在炎热的夏天，我还看见孩子们抱着盆盆罐罐，提着水桶、木勺，列着长长的队伍，向干旱的田野走去。他们用最轻便的提水工具，去参加抗旱救苗的斗争。
    在这里，孩子们参加各种战斗。他们正在学做社会主义和共产主义的接班人。
    老篾匠
    公社办起了敬老院：一间间瓦房修理得崭新崭新，一道道墙壁粉刷得雪白雪白，一张张床铺布置得整整齐齐……
    手工业社的七十多岁的老篾匠，有一手好手艺，干起活来干净利落。可是，一有空他就站在敬老院门外，呆呆地看得出神。
    公社的干部以为那准是老头羡慕敬老院里的生活，想进敬老院。
    有一天，当老头又在敬老院门口站着呆看的时候，干部和老头聊起来了。
    老篾匠说：“我喜欢敬老院。我活了七十多岁，还没见过这样好的地方。这真是新鲜事！”
    老篾匠说：“现在，让该进的先进去。我还能干活。等我干不动了，我才进这个大门……”
    老篾匠说：“嘿，到那时，敬老院准会比现在更好！”
    老篾匠天真地笑起来，眼睛眯成一条缝，干瘪的嘴巴咧开来。
    干部也笑了。这时，他才了解这个老篾匠……
