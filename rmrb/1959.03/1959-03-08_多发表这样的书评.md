    Publish More Book Reviews Like This

    The “Review of ‘A Draft History of the People's Republic of China’” (February 28th, page 7) is a good book review. It clearly points out the fundamental weakness of the “Draft History,” which is not only helpful to the author of the book and the general readers, but also enlightening to the units that are currently compiling history. I believe the criticism of all aspects is appropriate. The article adopts a well-intentioned attitude, and the criticism is serious and earnest. After reading it, one has the feeling of "being pleased to hear of one's faults."

    I hope that the People's Daily will organize forces to regularly make similar reviews of important works. This will play a role in promoting publishing work.

    多发表这样的书评
    “评‘中华人民共和国史稿’”  （2月28日七版）是一篇好的书评。它明确地指出了“史稿”的根本弱点，不仅对本书作者及广大读者有帮助，而且对现在正在编写历史的单位也有所启发。文章对各方面的批评我认为是恰当的。文章抱着与人为善的态度，批评又是认真严肃的。读了之后，使人有“闻过则喜”之感。
    希望人民日报组织力量对重要著作常作类似的评介。这对出版工作会起到促进的作用。
