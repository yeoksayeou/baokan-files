Scientific and Technological Research Laboratories in Communes
By our reporter Yu Zhenying

    In the Scientific and Technological Research Laboratory of the Nongfeng People's Commune Nongfeng Management Area in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, several slogans are posted, one of which reads with Mikulin’s words: "We cannot wait for nature's gifts, but must demand them from nature!" Those engaged in research work in this scientific and technological research laboratory include Party and Youth League members, veteran peasants, and junior and senior high school graduates. They are all commune members, very ordinary farmers. But when they talk about how to study science, apply science, and boldly explore new scientific knowledge, they speak with great knowledge and clarity.

    The Nongfeng People's Commune has seventeen scientific and technological research laboratories. The research laboratory in the Nongfeng Management Area is one of them, led by the Science and Technology Committee. The Party Branch Secretary is the director, and the Youth League Secretary and the middle school botany teacher are the deputy directors. They treat nature as their laboratory and focus on the central problems of current production as their research topics.

    Although the Scientific and Technological Research Laboratory of the Nongfeng Management Area has been established for less than a year, it has played a significant positive role in the development of production. People told me the story of how the scientific research laboratory uncovered the secrets of that piece of land north of the village. North of Nongfeng Village, there are twenty hectares of land. The millet planted there the year before last grew lush, with large ears and tall stalks. Passers-by all praised, "What a fine field of millet!" Commune members also estimated, "At least twenty *shi* per hectare." But when it came time to harvest in the autumn, after threshing, each hectare yielded only a little over six *shi*. With such a low yield, some said it was due to the cold rain in the autumn, others said it was due to the north wind. But no one really knew the reason. After the Scientific and Technological Research Laboratory was established, the Soil and Fertilizer Group conducted a survey, test, and analysis of the land. They discovered that the land had been cultivated too shallow for many years, forming a hard plow pan layer. The roots of the plants could not penetrate, and the soil was high in nitrogen fertilizer but low in phosphate fertilizer. Therefore, the stems and leaves were luxuriant, but the grains were not full, resulting in low yields. After hearing this report, Director Wang of the Management Area slapped his thigh with delight and said, "This investigation is truly meritorious, solving a mystery that we haven't been able to guess for many years!" They immediately deep-plowed the land, applied more phosphate fertilizer, and planted soybeans. Although they encountered a severe drought of more than seventy days in the summer, the soybeans in this field still achieved a bumper harvest, averaging more than 2,500 kilograms per hectare.

    In June, there was a prolonged drought, and the fields lacked seedlings and had gaps. If seedlings were transplanted into the fields, they would still wither and die. People were worried. At this time, Wen Lizhen, a young female researcher in the Crop Cultivation Group, remembered how, when she was a child, she saw an old farmer in her courtyard make bowls out of mud, fill them with soil and manure, plant flowers in them, and plant them in the ground, where they grew very lushly. Why not use this method to cultivate seedlings? While working in the fields, she discussed this idea with her comrades in the research laboratory, and everyone thought it made scientific sense. So during the noon break, they braved the hot sun, ignoring the streams of sweat, and made many mud bowls and planted seeds in them. In just three days, the seeds sprouted, and the seedlings grew strong and drought-resistant. This method was promoted throughout the management area, and more than 220,000 corn seedlings were cultivated day and night. This alone increased corn production by more than 330,000 kilograms. The Mechanical and Agricultural Implement Group successfully developed a Leap Forward-style weeding machine during summer hoeing, speeding up the pace of land clearing. The Animal Husbandry Group promoted rapid fattening methods such as injecting pigs with "milk needles" and excising the thyroid gland, causing the pigs to gain one kilogram of meat per day. During the few days I was there, the research laboratory staff and middle school botany teacher Yi Shichen were working together to successfully produce chlortetracycline using local methods, using seaweed, wheat flour, and potato flour. Feeding this to pigs can promote fattening and save the commune more than 10,000 yuan a year. They are now preparing to manufacture it on a large scale.

    "Old Trees Rejuvenated" is a miracle created by the Fruit Tree Horticulture Group. The fruit trees in the orchard on the north mountain were too old, and they didn't bear much fruit each year. In particular, those three pear trees on the east slope had not produced pears for four years, only blooming. After the Fruit Tree Horticulture Group took over the orchard, they were determined to change this situation. They read many relevant books, visited other orchards, and then analyzed the reasons for the lack of fruit and found solutions. They conducted scientific processing and cultivation of the fruit trees: scraping off the hard shells on the old bark, loosening the soil around the roots, fertilizing, and watering. They also carried out reasonable pruning to allow sunlight and air to penetrate. By autumn, the fruit trees were laden with fruit, bending the branches, and a bumper harvest was obtained. The highest yield was 255 kilograms per tree. The three old pear trees on the east slope also produced more than 75 kilograms of pears.

    Large-scale experimental fields are being cultivated, and research and mastery of crop growth patterns have blossomed everywhere. The 110 researchers in the research laboratory have formed 28 experimental field groups, each cultivating 60 hectares of experimental fields for crops such as soybeans, corn, millet, sorghum, and sugar beets. Through careful cultivation and processing, they have created records of 375 kilograms of soybeans per *mu* (more than twice that of ordinary fields), 500 kilograms of corn per *mu* (more than twice that of ordinary fields), 3,000 kilograms of sugar beets per *mu* (more than twice that of ordinary fields), 650 kilograms of rice per *mu* (more than one and a half times that of ordinary fields), and 350 kilograms of millet per *mu* (almost twice that of ordinary fields). According to statistics, the average yield of various crops in the 60 hectares of experimental fields reached more than 4,500 kilograms per hectare, more than twice that of ordinary fields. Zhang Yufa, a 71-year-old researcher, excitedly said: "People don't want to grow foxtail millet, saying it's low-yielding, but I insisted on trying it. I planted three *fen* of foxtail millet and corn. Do you know how tall they grew?" At this point, the old man stood up abruptly, straightened his back, raised an arm high, raised his voice, and said: "I'm not short, I'm over six *chi* tall with my arm raised, and I still couldn't reach the top of the millet. After threshing the grain and weighing it, the millet was 150 kilograms and the corn was 60 kilograms. My experience is: deep plow, apply more manure, water frequently, and care diligently. The land won't let you down."

    For many years, the people here have believed that whatever root you plant, you get that fruit; soybeans can only grow on soybean roots; potato plants cannot bear pumpkins. However, in production practice, the people in the research laboratory have changed this phenomenon with facts. In the autumn, in the experimental fields, people saw corn grafted onto sorghum, and it survived; pumpkins and potatoes were grafted together, and one plant bore two crops; potato buds were planted with potatoes, and the potatoes that grew were larger; soybeans and cockleburs were grafted together, blooming and bearing pods, and the pods were more numerous and brighter than ordinary soybeans. In the face of these facts, those who did not believe in science before could not help but be speechless.

    Spring has slowly come to Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of the motherland. The frozen land has begun to melt, and tender green grass sprouts are growing. Zhao Shuqing, the deputy director of the Scientific and Technological Research Laboratory of the Nongfeng Management Area, a twenty-year-old girl with thick eyebrows and big eyes who became the captain of the women's production team of the agricultural cooperative after graduating from elementary school (now the production captain of the commune), said that after the establishment of the People's Commune, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has opened up a broader path for scientific and technological research work and has also put forward higher and more urgent demands on researchers. This year, they will develop a set of yield-increasing technical measures based on the commune's production policies and the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture; continue to cultivate large-scale experimental fields; vigorously engage in plant grafting and hybridization; vigorously engage in livestock and poultry hybridization; and vigorously engage in tool reform. She confidently said: "All members of the research laboratory are determined to create greater achievements this year and dedicate them to the Party and Chairman Mao."

    公社里的科学技术研究室
    本报记者　于振瀛
    在黑龙江省双城县农丰人民公社农丰管理区科学技术研究室里，贴着几条标语，其中有一条写着米丘林的话：“我们不能等待大自然恩赐，要向大自然索取！”在这个科学技术研究室从事研究工作的，有党、团员，有老农，有初中和高中毕业生。他们都是公社的社员，很普通的庄稼人。但是当他们讲起怎样研究科学、运用科学，怎样大胆探索新的科学知识时，讲得头头是道。
    农丰人民公社共有十七个科学技术研究室，农丰管理区的研究室是其中之一，领导这个组织的是科学技术委员会，党支部书记是主任，团支部书记和中学植物教员是副主任。他们把大自然作为自己的研究室，把当前生产的中心问题作为研究课题。
    农丰管理区的科学技术研究室，成立虽然不到一年，但对生产的发展起了很大的积极作用。人们对我讲述了科学研究室，揭破了村北头那块土地秘密的故事。农丰村北头，有二十公顷地，前年种的谷子，长得叶肥穗大棵高，过路人都啧啧称赞道：“好一片谷子”，社员们也都互相估量说：“一公顷地起码能打二十石”。可是到秋熟收割，打下粮食一过斗，一公顷地只打六石多。产量这样少，有人说是秋天的冷雨灌的，有人说是北风吹的。到底什么缘故，谁也闹不清。科学技术研究室成立后，土壤肥料组对这块土地进行了勘察、化验、分析，发现原来是多年来土地耕作太浅，土壤形成一层坚硬的犁下层，植物的根扎不下去，同时这块土壤中氮肥多磷肥少，因此茎叶繁茂，籽粒不饱满，产量不高。管理区王主任听到这个报告后，高兴的一拍大腿说：“这个考察可真有功，解决了多少年没猜着的谜。”他们对这块地立即进行了深翻，多施磷肥，种上了大豆。虽然夏天遇到七十多天的大旱，这块地里的豆子仍然获得大丰收，平均每公顷地打五千多斤。
    6月，天久旱不下雨，大地缺苗断垅，若是在地里补苗，长出来仍然要枯干，人们犯愁了。这时，作物栽培组的年青的女研究员文丽珍，想起了自己小的时候，看到同院的老农用泥制成碗，里边盛着土和粪，种上花，栽在地里，长的特别茂盛。为什么不可以用这个办法育苗呢？她在田里劳动时，把这个主意和研究室的同志一商量，大家认为有科学道理。于是在中午休息时，她们顶着火热的太阳，不管汗珠直流，制了很多泥碗，种下种子。不过三天，种子出芽了，小苗长的既茁壮又能耐旱。全管理区推广这个办法，昼夜不停的育出包米苗二十二万多棵，仅此一项就增产包米六十六万多斤。机械农具组在夏锄时，试制成功了跃进式除草机，加快了铲地进度。畜牧组推广了猪打牛奶针，割甲状腺等速效育肥法，一天使猪长二斤肉。我在这里的几天当中，刚好研究室的人员和中学植物教员伊室臣在一起，用紫菜、小麦粉加土豆粉等，试制成功土法制造土霉素，给猪吃上这东西，可以催肥，而且一年能给公社节省一万多元。现在正准备大量制造。
    “老树回春”，这是果树园艺组创造的奇迹。北山上的果园里的果树年头太久了，每年都结不出多少水果，特别是东坡上那三棵梨树，光开花不结梨已经四年了。果树园艺组把果园接手过来之后，决心要改变这种状况。他们看了很多有关书籍，到别的果园去参观、访问，然后分析了不结果的原因，找出了办法，就是对果树进行了科学的加工培育：刮去老树皮上的硬壳，对树根进行了松土、施肥、浇水；还进行了合理剪枝，让阳光和空气能透过去。到秋天，果树上结的果实累累，压弯了枝，获得大丰收，最高产量一棵树结五百一十斤。东坡上那三棵老梨树也结了一百五十多斤梨。
    大种试验田，研究和掌握作物的生长规律，已经出现了遍地开花的景象。研究室的一百一十名研究员，组成了二十八个试验田小组，分别搞大豆、包米、谷子、高粱、甜菜等作物试验田六十公顷。经过精心的培养加工，创造了大豆亩产七百五十斤（比一般田多二倍）、包米亩产千斤（比一般田多二倍多）、甜菜亩产六千斤（比一般田多二倍）、水稻亩产一千三百斤（比一般田多一倍半）、谷子亩产七百斤（比一般田多将近两倍）的纪录。据统计，六十公顷试验田，各种作物平均每公顷产量达九千斤以上，比一般田多出一倍多。七十一岁的老研究员张玉发兴奋的说：“人家都不乐意种糜子，说是低产，我偏要试试。种了三分地糜子和包米，你说长多高？”说到这，老人霍地站起来，伸直了腰，高高的举起一只臂提高嗓门说：“像我这个身量不算低，扬手有六尺多，还够不到糜子梢，打下粮食一过秤，糜子三百斤，包米一百二。我的经验就是：深翻地，多上粪，勤浇水，勤伺弄，地不亏人。”
    多少年了，这里的人祖祖辈辈都认为：有什么根结什么果；大豆只能长在豆根上；土豆秧结不出倭瓜来。可是，在生产实践中，研究室的人们已经用事实改变了这种现象。到了秋天，在试验田里，人们看到了高粱嫁接的苞米，活了；倭瓜和土豆嫁接，一棵种结了两种作物；土豆芽种土豆，结的土豆更大；大豆和苍子嫁接，开花结荚，而且比一般的大豆荚多粒亮。在这些事实面前，原来那些不相信科学的人，不能不哑口无言。
    春天姗姗地来到了祖国最北部的黑龙江省，冰封的土地开始融化，嫩绿的草芽在滋长。农丰管理区科学技术研究室的副主任赵淑清，一个有着一双浓眉大眼睛的二十岁的姑娘，高小毕业后就当上了农业合作社的女生产队队长（现在是公社生产队长），她说，人民公社建立以后，农林牧副渔的全面大发展，给科学技术研究工作开辟了更广阔的道路，也对研究人员提出了更高更迫切的要求。今年他们将要根据公社的生产方针和农业“八字宪法”，研究出一套增产技术措施；继续大搞试验田；大搞植物嫁接、杂交；大搞家畜家禽杂交；大搞工具改革。她满怀信心地说：研究室的全体人员坚决要在今年创造更大的成绩，献给党和毛主席。
