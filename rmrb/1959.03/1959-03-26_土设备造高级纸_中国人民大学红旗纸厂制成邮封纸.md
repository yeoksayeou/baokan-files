    Crude Equipment Produces High-Grade Paper
    Red Flag Paper Mill of Renmin University of China Successfully Produces Envelope Paper
    (Our Newspaper) The Red Flag Paper Mill of Renmin University of China has produced a thin, high-grade paper – envelope paper – using equipment that combines indigenous and foreign methods. This paper can be used for typing, copying, printing transfer slips, and packaging high-end candies and pastries.
    The equipment used by this factory to produce envelope paper is: a small paper machine with a wood and iron structure and a gas drying cylinder, which is a combination of indigenous and foreign papermaking equipment (foreign paper machines are made entirely of iron and use steam for drying). The machine speed is 12.5 meters per minute, the paper weight is 20 grams per square meter, and it operated continuously for 19 hours and 35 minutes, producing a total of 193.5 kilograms of envelope paper in four colors: red, yellow, white, and blue, with an average production rate of 10 kilograms per hour.
    The raw material ratio for envelope paper is: 50% bleached wood pulp, 50% unbleached reed pulp, 0.7% rosin, and 0.2% alum. The paper quality has a high gloss appearance, a whiteness of over 80 degrees, excellent uniformity and gloss, and good tensile strength, fully meeting usage requirements. The colored paper is bright and beautiful. Trial production proves that small, indigenous paper mills can not only produce a variety of paper types but also have excellent quality that can rival foreign machines. For example, the factory's No. 2 paper machine is a foreign machine, which in the past could only produce envelope paper weighing 23 grams per square meter, while the newly installed indigenous paper machine can produce even thinner envelope paper weighing 20 grams per square meter. This shows that indigenous equipment can not only produce ordinary glazed paper, wrapping paper, and other general cultural papers but also produce higher quality papers, such as envelope paper, high-grade stationery, and single-sided embossed printing paper.

    土设备造高级纸
    中国人民大学红旗纸厂制成邮封纸
    本报讯　中国人民大学红旗造纸厂用“土洋结合”的设备生产出一种薄型高级纸——邮封纸。这种纸，可供打字、复写、印制传票以及包装高级的糖果、糕点之用。
    这个厂生产邮封纸所使用的设备是：铁木结构，煤气烘缸的小纸机，这是一种土洋结合的造纸设备（洋纸机是全部用铁制成，用蒸汽干燥）。车速每分钟十二公尺半，纸重每平方公尺二十公分，连续运转十九时三十五分，共生产红、黄、白、蓝四种颜色的邮封纸一百九十三点五公斤，平均每小时抄造量十公斤。
    邮封纸的原料配比：漂白木浆50％，未漂苇浆50％，松香0.7％，明矾0.2％。纸的质量，外观光泽大，白度八十度以上，匀度、光泽很好，拉力很好，完全合乎使用要求。色纸鲜艳美观。试生产证明，小土群纸厂不仅能生产多种纸张品种，同时质量也很好，可与洋机器媲美。如该厂二号纸机是一台洋机器，过去利用这台机器只能生产每平方公尺二十三克重的邮封纸，而新装这台土纸机却能生产更薄的每平方公尺重二十克的邮封纸。这表明土设备不仅可以生产普通的有光纸、包装纸等一般文化用纸，而且还可生产质量较高的，譬如邮封纸、高级信纸和单面凸板印刷纸之类的高级纸。
