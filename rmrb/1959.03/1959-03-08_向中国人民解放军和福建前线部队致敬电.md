To the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and all commanders and fighters of the Fujian Front Troops:

    As the women of our capital jubilantly celebrate the 1959 "March 8th" International Women's Day, we extend our highest respect and heartfelt greetings to you – the defenders of socialist construction and the guardians of the happy lives of women and children – with utmost excitement and gratitude.

    Dear comrades: Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are going all out, aiming high, and building our great motherland in a faster, better, and more economical way, and have achieved brilliant successes. The output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton has increased several times over, and other production, construction, and cultural and educational undertakings have also seen an all-round leap forward. Every fruitful labor result in the construction of the motherland is also a brilliant achievement in your defense of peace. Every victory from the coastal defense front is a great encouragement to us, increasing our confidence and strength to overcome difficulties and strive for greater victories. We will always stand with you, continuously going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, striving to build our country into a great socialist nation, and fighting to the end for the realization of the communist ideal.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the women of the capital have participated in the socialist construction of the capital with lofty labor enthusiasm and soaring revolutionary vigor, making tremendous contributions. The ranks of female workers in the capital have expanded unprecedentedly, from 140,000 in 1957 to 210,000. Thanks to the establishment of people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, production has greatly developed; the collectivization of housework has been quickly realized throughout the suburbs, and 490,000 women have been投入了各种生产劳动. In 1958, after the great rectification campaign and the publicity and education of the General Line, more than 200,000 housewives in the capital participated in social labor. All these achievements are the great results of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the great victory of the Party's General Line, and are inseparable from your day and night guarding of the motherland's borders and coastal defenses, defending the motherland, and safeguarding peace. We love peace and cherish the fruits of labor even more. We vow to be your strong backing and fully support you. If imperialism dares to invade our country, our entire nation will inflict a devastating blow on the enemy! Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are our country's territories. We are determined to join the people of the whole country in resolutely struggling for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, the complete reunification of the motherland, and the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the world!

                      Capital Women's Commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day Conference.
                                              March 7, 1959

    向中国人民解放军和福建前线部队致敬电英勇的中国人民解放军和福建前线部队全体指战员同志们：
    当我们首都妇女欢欣鼓舞地纪念1959年“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我们怀着无比兴奋和感激的心情，向你们——社会主义建设的保卫者、妇女儿童幸福生活的保卫者，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    亲爱的同志们：全国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设着我们伟大的祖国，并且取得了光辉的成就，钢、煤、粮、棉的产量成倍地增长，其他各项生产建设和文教事业也都出现了全面的跃进。祖国建设中的每一项丰硕的劳动成果，同时也是你们保卫和平的光辉战果。海防前线的每一个胜利消息，对我们都是极大的鼓舞，增加了我们战胜困难争取更大胜利的信心和力量。我们永远和你们一道，不断鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，并为实现共产主义的理想而奋斗到底。
    首都妇女在党的领导下，以崇高的劳动热情和冲天的革命干劲，参加了首都的社会主义建设，作出了巨大的贡献。首都女职工的队伍空前壮大了，从1957年的十四万人增加到二十一万人。北京郊区由于人民公社的建立，生产有了很大发展；全郊区很快地实现了家务劳动集体化，有四十九万妇女投入了各种生产劳动。1958年，首都的广大家庭妇女经过伟大的整风运动和总路线的宣传教育，有二十万余人参加了社会劳动。所有这些成就，是党中央和毛主席正确领导的伟大成果，是党的总路线的伟大胜利，也是和你们日日夜夜守卫着祖国的边疆和海防，保卫祖国、保卫和平的伟大功勋分不开的。我们热爱和平，更热爱劳动的成果，我们誓作你们的后盾，全力支援你们。帝国主义如果胆敢侵犯我们的祖国，我们全国人民必将给敌人以毁灭性的打击！台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖是我国的领土，我们决心和全国人民一道，为解放台、澎、金、马，实现祖国的完全统一，为维护远东及世界和平而坚决斗争！
                      首都各界妇女纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会。
                                              1959年3月7日
