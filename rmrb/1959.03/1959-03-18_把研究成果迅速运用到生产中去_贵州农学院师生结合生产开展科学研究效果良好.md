Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 17th: Teachers and students from Guizhou Agricultural College, who have been sent down to the Huaxi People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang, are closely combining scientific research with the current production of wheat and rapeseed.

There are more than 300 teachers and students sent down. In the past, students also had certain research projects on crops such as wheat and rapeseed at school. However, the topics were determined according to books, and the research activities were mostly carried out in flowerpots and greenhouses. The research content was limited to changes in the roots, stems, and leaves of crops. The students were not interested, and many research topics were abandoned halfway. Now, the students directly participate in production, and practice has raised many questions for them, such as the early flowering of rapeseed, the "third-class seedlings" and lodging of wheat. Researching these issues is of great significance to agricultural production. In this way, the students realize that scientific research must serve production, and they also realize that there is much to be done in agricultural science, so they all enthusiastically participate in research activities.

In the past two months, many of the projects researched by the teachers and students have achieved certain results. For example, Liao Changli and other nine fourth-year students have researched methods to prevent wheat lodging, which have been promoted as important measures in the high-yield wheat fields of Dazhai. The methods studied by students Xia Xueyuan, Chen Chaofang, and others to make rapeseed branch more and increase yield per unit area have also achieved good results.

These sent-down teachers and students eat, live, and work with the farmers. Their research work is also carried out in professional teams of the commune, and research groups are established together with the commune members. In this way, with the participation of commune members with rich production experience, the difficult problems in the research work are quickly solved, and the research results can be quickly promoted. Through this research method, teachers and students have formulated a set of wheat and rapeseed cultivation measures that are both practical and in line with scientific principles.

In addition, through more than two months of production labor combined with scientific research, in addition to verifying the theoretical knowledge they have learned in the past and consolidating their learning results, the students generally feel a lack of knowledge and require further study. In order to meet the students' learning requirements, the school has adopted a method of combining classroom teaching and on-site teaching, and inviting local experts and teachers to teach together to strengthen the guidance of students' learning.

After more than two months of testing, the cucumbers they planted matured more than 20 days earlier than those cultivated by general methods.

### 把研究成果迅速运用到生产中去  贵州农学院师生结合生产开展科学研究效果良好

    把研究成果迅速运用到生产中去
    贵州农学院师生结合生产开展科学研究效果良好
    新华社贵阳17日电　贵州农学院下放到贵阳市郊花溪人民公社的师生，紧密结合当前小麦和油菜的生产，开展科学研究。
    这批下放师生共有三百多人。学生们过去在学校对小麦和油菜等作物也有一定的研究项目。但是题目是照书本确定的，研究活动多在花盆和温室中进行，研究内容局限于对农作物的根、茎、叶各部的变化方面。学生引不起兴趣，有好些研究题目都半途而废了。现在，学生们直接参加生产，实践为他们提出了许多问题，如油菜的早花、小麦的三类苗和倒伏等。研究这些问题，对农业生产有重要的意义。这样，学生们一方面认识到科学研究必须为生产服务，另一方面也认识到学农科大有可为，因此都兴致勃勃地参加了研究活动。
    两个月来，师生们研究的项目有许多已取得了一定成绩。如四年级学生廖昌礼等九人研究防止小麦倒伏的办法，已在大寨的小麦丰产田里作为重要措施来推行。学生夏学渊、陈朝芳等人研究的使油菜多分枝、提高单位面积产量的办法，也收到良好效果。
    这些下放的师生，都是和农民同吃同住同劳动，他们的研究工作也是以公社专业队为单位，和社员一起建立研究小组来进行的。这样，由于有了富有生产经验的社员参加，就使研究工作中的疑难问题很快得到解决，研究成果也能迅速推广。通过这样的研究方法，师生们已订出了一套既切实可行又符合科学原理的小麦和油菜的培育措施。
    此外，学生们通过两个多月的结合科学研究的生产劳动，除印证了过去所学的理论知识、巩固了学习成果以外，还普遍感到知识缺乏，要求进一步学习。为了满足学生们的学习要求，学校已采取课堂教学和现场教学相结合、聘请土专家和教师共同教学的方法，来加强指导学生的学习。（附图片）
