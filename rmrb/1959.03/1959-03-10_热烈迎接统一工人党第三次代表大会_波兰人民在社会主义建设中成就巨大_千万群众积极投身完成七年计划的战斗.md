    Warsaw, March 9th (Special dispatch from our newspaper reporter Li Ke): The Polish United Workers' Party will convene its Third National Congress on March 10th. On the eve of this historically significant day for the Polish people, life in every corner of the country is bubbling with activity. Everywhere one can feel a surge of high political enthusiasm, as millions of people are swept up in the production emulation movement to greet the Party Congress. Everyone is excitedly discussing the plans formulated by the Party for the future development of the country. The Polish people feel proud and honored of the achievements their country has made under the leadership of the United Workers' Party. In the Party's leadership, they see an even brighter and more splendid tomorrow for their motherland, and this feeling is even more intense as they welcome the Party's "Third Congress."
    In Poland, it has been less than fifteen years since the working class established its political power, and the actual time spent on construction is only nine years (1950-1958), because before 1949, the main task of the people's government was to heal the wounds left by the war, and clear away the piles of rubble left by the gunfire. What has the United Workers' Party led the people to do in these fifteen years, or rather, in the nine years of construction?
    First, to build a backward agricultural country into a strong industrial country. In the nine years, Poland has built more than 10,000 large and small industrial and mining enterprises, and expanded existing enterprises. Now, Poland has 491 large factories with more than 1,000 employees, while in 1938 there were only 101. New industrial sectors have been established one after another, including dozens of brand-new industrial sectors such as shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, aluminum production, bearing manufacturing, and artificial fiber production. Before the war, in 1938, the output of Poland's major industrial products was lower than the world average. After nine years of construction, Poland has joined the ranks of advanced industrial countries. More than half of its national income is derived from industry, and many important products occupy a significant position in world production. Poland ranks sixth in the world in coal production, tenth in pig iron production, eleventh in shipbuilding, and twelfth in electricity production. Another indicator of Poland's level of industrialization is that the export of machinery and equipment accounts for an increasing proportion of total exports. Before the war, Poland's machinery exports accounted for only 1% of total exports, but now they account for 25%, and will soon surpass coal to become the top export.
    Second, to ensure the continuous development of production. In 1958, Poland's total industrial output was more than five times that of the pre-war period, and the per capita output was seven times that of the pre-war period. The output of important industrial sectors has grown at a rapid rate every year. In 1958, Poland's steel production was 5.63 million tons, four times that of the pre-war period; electricity was 23.9 billion kilowatt-hours, six and a half times that of the pre-war period; coal was 95 million tons, two and a half times that of the pre-war period. The production development speed of many newly built industrial sectors after the war, such as machine manufacturing and the chemical industry, is even more unparalleled.
    On the agricultural front, Poland's development speed is not as fast as that of the industrial sector because it is facing the task of socialist transformation of the countryside, but the total agricultural output has also greatly increased. The average yield of grain per hectare has increased from 11.4 quintals before liberation to about 14.4 quintals, and grain production has increased from an average of 385 kilograms per person in 1938 to an average of 478 kilograms per person.
    On the basis of the continuous development of industry and agriculture, Poland has improved the people's living standards. In 1958, the per capita national income was 3.2 times higher than in 1938, and the people's income and consumption levels have greatly increased. In 1938, the average per capita meat consumption was 21 kilograms, now it is 45 kilograms, and milk consumption has increased from 288 liters to 374 liters. Sugar consumption is now 37 kilograms and cotton cloth is 20 meters. In nine years, Poland has built more than 2 million new houses, improving the people's living conditions. In addition, no one now has to endure the suffering of unemployment like in the pre-war period. The children of the working people have the opportunity to receive education. Everyone receives proper medical care, and more than 240,000 working people can go to sanatoriums and rest homes every year to rest, which is something that the working masses dared not dream of during the rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie.
    During this period, Poland also experienced phenomena such as unbalanced development of various economic sectors, and incompatibility between economic development and the improvement of people's living standards. However, the Party is correcting these shortcomings, and these shortcomings are insignificant compared to the great achievements.
    Let us take another look at what the Polish bourgeois regime did in the past? It is not without significance to compare the era when the landlords and the bourgeoisie ruled Poland with the period of the people's regime. The Polish landlords and bourgeoisie did all sorts of things in the twenty years between the First World War and the Second World War, but they did not do good things. In these twenty years, Poland's industrial and agricultural production declined, and there were seven or eight million unemployed people across the country, with hunger and poverty everywhere. Compared with 1938 and 1913, coal production decreased by 14%, and pig iron decreased by 16%; if the level of industrial production in Poland in 1913 was equivalent to 30% of the European average per capita, it dropped to 20% in 1938; agricultural output in 1938 was also lower than in 1913. This is the situation in Poland under the rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie. And the regime led by the working class has restored the war-torn economy in less than fifteen years, and increased industrial production by nearly five times. What a stark contrast!
    The tremendous achievements of Poland's recovery and development in the past fifteen years show the infinite vitality and great vigorous vitality of the socialist system. In terms of Poland's industrial development speed, no capitalist country dares to compete with it. After Poland ended the recovery period in 1949 and began large-scale construction, the average industrial development speed from 1950 to 1958 was more than 14%. In the capitalist world, the average annual growth of industrial production from 1951 to 1955 was 5.9%, 4.3% in 1956, and 2.6% in 1957. In 1958, due to the impact of the economic crisis that started in the United States, industrial production not only did not increase, but was lower than in 1957.
    It would take Germany twelve years, France fifteen years, and Britain twenty-eight years to achieve the growth in per capita steel production in Poland from 1950 to 1957. It would take the United States eleven years, Britain and Germany twelve years, and France twenty-two years to achieve the growth in electricity production in Poland in eight years. It would take Britain eleven years, Germany and France twenty-three years, and Italy nineteen years to achieve the growth in cement production in Poland in eight years. The superiority of the socialist system is fully demonstrated in life practice.
    The strong industrial base established by the Polish people in the past nine years enables the country to further realize comprehensive industrialization, improve the people's living standards, and catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe in the near future. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party is convened to solve this huge task. According to the instructions on the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 proposed by the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, by 1965, Poland's industrial production will increase by 80%. Seven years later, the per capita output of important products in Poland will exceed Italy, and catch up with or exceed the current level of France. In seven years, agriculture will increase by 30%, and the per capita output of meat, milk and sugar will exceed the current level of France and West Germany. By 1965, 80% of households in the country will have radios, 70% of households will have bicycles, about one in every four households will have a television and washing machine, and one in every five households will have a sewing machine and motorcycle, and the people's lives will be significantly improved.
    If the industrial production of socialist system countries in the world is to exceed that of capitalist countries by 1965, accounting for more than half of the world's industrial production, then in this competition, the Polish people will contribute a huge force.
    The Polish people, who have made great achievements in the past construction period, are inspired by the seven-year development instructions put forward by the Party, and are confidently moving towards a greater and more victorious tomorrow. (Attached picture)

### 热烈迎接统一工人党第三次代表大会  波兰人民在社会主义建设中成就巨大  千万群众积极投身完成七年计划的战斗

    热烈迎接统一工人党第三次代表大会
    波兰人民在社会主义建设中成就巨大
    千万群众积极投身完成七年计划的战斗
    本报华沙9日专电　记者李克报道：波兰统一工人党将于3月10日召开第三次全国代表大会，在这个对波兰人民有历史意义的日子的前夕，全国各个角落的生活都沸腾起来了，到处可以感到一股高涨的政治热情的激流，成百万的人民卷入了迎接党的代表大会的生产献礼运动中，人人在兴奋地谈论着党所制定的国家未来发展的计划。波兰人民对于自己的国家在统一工人党的领导下所获得的成就感到骄傲和自豪，他们在党的领导中看到了祖国更加光辉灿烂的明天，在迎接党的“三大”的日子里，人们的这种心情更加浓重起来了。
    在波兰，工人阶级建立政权的时间还不到十五年，而真正从事建设的时间不过九年（1950—1958年），因为在1949年前，人民政权的主要工作是医治战争留下来的百孔千疮，清除炮火留下的成堆的瓦砾。在这十五年间，或者说在九年的建设期间，统一工人党领导人民做了些什么呢？
    首先，把一个落后的农业国建设成强大的工业国。在九年期间，波兰建设了一万多个大小工矿企业，并且扩大了旧有的企业，现在，波兰一千人以上的大工厂有四百九十一个，而在1938年只有一百零一个。新的工业部门一个接一个地建立了起来，其中有造船、汽车、制铝、轴承、人造纤维等几十个崭新的工业部门。战前的1938年，波兰主要工业品的产量低于世界的平均水平，经过九年建设，波兰已跻身于先进工业国家的行列。它的国民收入一半以上是得自工业的；许多重要产品在世界生产中占有显著的地位。波兰煤的生产占世界第六位，生铁产量占世界第十位，造船占第十一位，电力占第十二位。另一个表明波兰工业化程度的标志是，机器设备的出口在全部出口商品中占着越来越大的比重，战前波兰机器的出口不过占全部出口的1％，而现在已经占25％，很快就要超过煤炭而占出口第一位。
    其次，保证了生产的不断发展。1958年波兰工业总产量已相当于战前的五倍多，按人口平均计算则为战前的七倍，重要工业部门的产量每年都以飞跃的速度增长。1958年波兰钢产量五百六十三万吨，相当于战前的四倍，电力二百三十九亿度，为战前的六倍半；煤九千五百万吨，为战前的二倍半，机器制造工业和化学工业等许多战后新建的工业部门，生产发展速度之快更是无可比拟。
    在农业战线上，波兰因为面临农村社会主义改造的任务，发展速度不及工业部门，但是农业总产量也有很大提高，每公顷谷物的平均产量由解放前的十一点四公担提高到约十四点四公担，粮食产量从1938年每人平均三百八十五公斤提高到每人平均四百七十八公斤。
    波兰在工农业不断发展的基础上，改善了人民的生活。1958年按人口平均的国民收入已高于1938年三点二倍，人民的收入和消费水平大大提高了。1938年每人平均的肉类消费量是二十一公斤，现在是四十五公斤，牛奶的消费由二百八十八公升提高到三百七十四公升。现在砂糖的消费达三十七公斤，棉布达二十公尺。在九年间，波兰新盖了二百多万间房子，改善了人民的居住条件。此外，现在任何人也不须忍受像战前时期那种失业的痛苦。劳动人民的子女有受教育的机会。人人得到妥善的医疗照顾，每年有二十四万多劳动人民可以到疗养院和休养所去休息，这都是工农大众在地主资产阶级统治时期所不敢梦想的。
    在这段期间，波兰在建设中也出现过各经济部门发展不平衡、以及经济发展和人民生活水平的提高不相适应等现象。但是，党正在纠正这些缺点，而且，这些缺点和伟大的成就比起来，是微不足道的。
    我们再来看一看，波兰资产阶级政权在过去作了些什么？把地主、资产阶级统治波兰的时代和人民政权时期作一比较，不是没有意义的。波兰地主、资产阶级在从第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战之间的二十年间，做了各式各样的事情，就是没有做好事。在这二十年中，波兰工农业生产下降了，全国有七、八百万的失业人口，到处是饥饿和贫困。如果拿1938年和1913年相比，煤产量下降了14％，生铁下降了16％；如果说1913年波兰工业生产水平按人口平均相当于欧洲平均水平的30％，到1938年，则下降到20％；1938年的农业产量也比1913年为低。这就是波兰在地主、资产阶级统治下的情况。而工人阶级所领导下的政权，在不到十五年的期间，恢复了战争破坏的经济，把工业生产提高了将近五倍，这是多么鲜明的对比啊！
    波兰人民十五年来恢复发展的巨大成绩，显示出了社会主义制度的无限生命力和伟大蓬勃的生机。从波兰工业发展速度来说，任何一个资本主义国家也不敢望其项背。波兰从1949年结束恢复时期开始大规模建设之后，工业发展速度从1950年到1958年，平均速度达14％以上。而在资本主义世界，在从1951年到1955年期间，工业生产平均每年增长5.9％，1956年为4.3％，1957年为2.6％，1958年由于美国开始的经济危机的影响，工业生产不但没有增长，反而比1957年低。
    要取得波兰在1950—1957年间按人口平均的钢产量增长的成就，德国要十二年，法国要十五年，英国则要二十八年的时间。要取得波兰八年中在电力生产上增长的成就，美国要十一年，英国和德国要十二年，法国要二十二年的时间。要得到波兰八年中在水泥生产上增长的成就，英国要十一年，德国和法国要二十三年，意大利要十九年的时间。社会主义制度的优越性完全在生活实践中显示出来了。
    波兰人民在以往的九年期间所建立的强大的工业基地，使得国家能够进一步实现全面工业化，提高人民的生活水平，以及在不远的将来赶上和超过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家。波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会就是为了要解决这项巨大的任务而召开的。根据统一工人党第十二次中央全会提出的1959—1965年国民经济发展的指示，到1965年，波兰工业生产要增长80％，七年后，波兰按人口平均的重要产品的产量将超过意大利，赶上或超过法国目前的水平。七年间，农业要增长30％，按人口平均的肉类、牛奶和砂糖产量，超过法国和西德目前的水平。到1965年，全国80％的家庭将有收音机，70％的家庭有自行车，大约平均每四家有一架电视机和洗衣机，每五家有一架缝纫机和摩托车，人民的生活将获得显著改善。
    如果说，到1965年世界社会主义体系国家的工业生产要超过资本主义国家，占世界工业生产量的一半以上，那么在这个竞赛中，波兰人民将贡献出巨大的力量。
    在过去建设时期取得伟大成就的波兰人民，为党所提出来的七年发展指示所鼓舞，正满怀信心地走向更大胜利的明天。（附图片）
