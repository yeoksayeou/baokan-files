Increase the Construction of Chemical Mines to Guarantee Chemical Raw Materials
This Year's Output of Major Chemical Mines Will Double Last Year's

    (Our report) In order to guarantee the growth of basic chemicals, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and inorganic industries, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to newly build and expand some chemical mines this year, totaling twenty-five projects. The construction of these mines will not only guarantee the needs of chemical industrial production this year, but also lay the foundation for the future development of chemical mines.

    Among the newly built and expanded chemical mine projects this year, the key major projects include: large-scale phosphate mines in Kaiyang, Guizhou and Jinping, Jiangsu; large-scale pyrite mines in Yingde, Guangdong and Xiangshan, Anhui; and boron mines in Liaoning. These projects have a large construction scale, with annual output of pyrite and phosphate mines ranging from 300,000 to 1,000,000 tons.

    Among the newly built and expanded chemical mine projects this year, some will be put into production successively within the year. After this part is put into production, the output of pyrite this year will increase by about 100% compared with last year, the output of phosphate rock will increase by 90%, and the output of boron minerals will increase by 50%. New mineral types such as natural alkali, potash salt, magnetic pyrite, and niter have also been added. At present, some of the newly built and expanded key projects are being rushed to construct, striving to put them into production ahead of schedule within the year; other projects are accelerating construction.

    In order to accelerate the construction of chemical mines, the Ministry of the Chemical Industry, in accordance with the general line of going all out, aiming high and building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results and the conditions of manpower and material resources, has classified the newly built and expanded projects this year according to priorities, and launched them in batches, concentrating on them in batches. Appropriate arrangements have also been made in the distribution of materials and equipment.

    Also reported: The Jinping Phosphate Mine in Xin’hai’lian City, Jiangsu, has been bravely fought by thousands of workers for the past two years, digging 18.2 kilometers of underground base roads, completing various cave, development, and cutting tasks of 30,759 cubic meters, and installing 3,268 tons of various equipment. Now, the workers are finishing the final works and making full preparations for mass production this year.

    This year, the mine's Party committee, through summing up the work in 1958, has formulated a grand plan for 1959. After completing the expansion project of the entire mine in the first quarter, it will not only produce a large amount of concentrate powder and raw ore, but also engage in the comprehensive utilization of phosphate rock on a large scale, building a phosphorus production plant and a phosphate fertilizer plant with huge production capacity, producing yellow phosphorus, red phosphorus, and calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer. In addition, many satellite factories will be established. The total output value will increase by more than six times compared with 1958.

    Employees of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Bureau built a borax plant in the Kunlun Mountains. This factory uses the rich raw boron in its nearby area to process and refine borax.

### 增建化学矿场　保证化工原料  今年主要化学矿产量将比去年翻一番

    增建化学矿场　保证化工原料
    今年主要化学矿产量将比去年翻一番
    本报讯　化学工业部为了保证基本化学和化学肥料、农药、无机物工业生产增长的需要，决定今年新建和扩建一部分化学矿，共有二十五项。这些矿山的建设，不仅可以保证今年化学工业生产的需要，而且为今后化学矿的发展打下了基础。
    今年新建和扩建化学矿的项目中，带有关键性的重大项目包括：贵州的开阳、江苏的锦屏等大型磷矿，广东的英德、安徽的向山等大型硫铁矿，辽宁的硼矿等，这些项目的建设规模较大，其中硫铁矿和磷矿的年产量都在三十万到一百万吨。
    今年新建和扩建的化学矿的项目中，有一部分年内就可以先后投入生产。这一部分投入生产后，今年的硫铁矿产量将比去年增长一倍左右，磷矿产量增长90％，硼矿产量增长50％。还增加了天然碱、钾盐、磁硫铁矿、硝石等新矿种。目前新建和扩建的关键性项目，一部分正在抓紧施工，力争年内提前投入生产；另一部分工程，正加速建设。
    为了加速化学矿的建设，化学工业部根据多快好省的方针和人力物力的条件，对今年新建和扩建的工程项目，分清主次，分批“上马”，分批突击。在材料、设备的分配上，也做了适当安排。
    又讯　江苏新海连市的锦屏磷矿，两年来经过了上千名的工人的英勇奋战，开凿了十八点二公里的地下基道，完成了各种洞室、开拓、切割任务达三万零七百五十九立方，安装了各种设备达三千二百六十八吨。现在，工人们正在结束收尾工程，并为今年大生产做好充分准备。
    今年，矿党委通过总结1958年工作，已制订出1959年的宏伟计划。在第一季度结束全矿扩建工程后，不仅要生产大量精矿粉和原矿，同时还要大搞磷灰石综合利用，建成有巨大生产能力的制磷厂和磷肥厂，生产黄磷、赤磷、钙镁磷肥。此外还建立许多卫星厂。总产值将比1958年增长六倍多。
    青藏公路运输管理局职工在昆仑山里建设了一座硼砂厂。这个厂利用它附近地区丰富的原硼加工提炼硼砂。
