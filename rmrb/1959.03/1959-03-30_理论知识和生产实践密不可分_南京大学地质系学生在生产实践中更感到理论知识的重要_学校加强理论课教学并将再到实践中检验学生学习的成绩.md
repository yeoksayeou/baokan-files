Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 29th. Students of the Geology Department of Nanjing University, after engaging in various geological works in the field, have not only improved their practical knowledge but also felt the importance of theoretical knowledge, thereby enhancing students' interest in theoretical studies.

Last year, more than 400 teachers and students from the Geology Department of Nanjing University went to the field for various geological works. After more than five months, they discovered 48 mineral species in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, with a prospective reserve of 10.5 billion tons. In addition, they compiled geological maps of various scales covering 50,000 square kilometers. These activities greatly enriched the students' practical knowledge. For example, in the past, students' level of visual identification and naming of rocks was very poor; the rocks, minerals, and structural phenomena seen in the classroom were standardized and typical. Therefore, some students couldn't even distinguish pyrite from chalcopyrite in the field. Through practical work, students' level of visual identification and naming of rocks has been greatly improved, and they have a deep impression of the stratigraphic division and lithological characteristics of certain areas. Most second-year students can identify 25 common minerals, which greatly enhances students' emphasis on perceptual knowledge. At the same time, students also felt the importance of theoretical knowledge in practice. For example, first-year students, because they have studied the theory of "faults," can generally analyze "faults" when they see them in the field, but they cannot analyze some complex "faults" because they lack theoretical knowledge of "structural geology." Some third-year students, because they did not master "ore genesis theory" well, encountered many difficulties when they were assigned to inspect tungsten mines. The second time they went to the tungsten mine, they brought some reference books to study and work simultaneously, which made the work much easier. Through these personal experiences, the students have been more serious in their study of various professional theories after returning to school than before.

Based on the above situation, the Geology Department of Nanjing University has made reasonable arrangements for the study time of various basic theoretical courses and professional theoretical courses this year. In addition to ensuring a certain teaching time for basic theoretical courses and professional theoretical courses, it has also added a number of the latest theoretical knowledge courses in the field of geology, including cutting-edge theoretical courses such as radioactivity and electronics.

In order to adhere to the principle of integrating theory with practice, the Geology Department of this school, while strengthening theoretical courses, has also decided that all students in the department will go to the field again after August this year to carry out various geological investigation activities to test their theoretical learning achievements in practice.

    理论知识和生产实践密不可分
    南京大学地质系学生在生产实践中更感到理论知识的重要
    学校加强理论课教学并将再到实践中检验学生学习的成绩
    新华社南京29日电　南京大学地质系学生经过在野外进行各种地质工作后，一方面提高了实际知识，一方面使他们更感到理论知识的重要，从而提高了学生对理论学习的兴趣。
    去年下半年，南京大学地质系有四百多名师生到野外进行各种地质工作。经过五个多月的时间，他们在江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、江西五省发现四十八个矿种，这些矿种远景储量达一百零五亿吨。此外，他们还填制了各种比例尺地质图五万平方公里。这些活动，大大丰富了学生们的实际知识。例如，过去学生们对岩石的肉眼鉴定、定名水平很差；在课堂里看到的岩石、矿物及构造现象都是标准化、典型化了的东西，因此有些学生到野外连黄铁矿和黄铜矿都分不清。通过实际工作的锻炼，学生们对岩石的肉眼鉴定和定名水平大大提高了，对某些地区的地层分层、岩性特征有了深刻的印象，大部分二年级的学生就能鉴别二十五种常见的矿物，从而大大地提高了学生们对感性知识的重视。同时，学生们在实践中也感到理论知识的重要。如一年级的学生因为学习过“断层”方面的理论，到野外见到“断层”都能作一般的分析，但是对一些复杂的“断层”就不会分析了，因为他们缺乏“构造地质学”方面的理论知识。三年级有的学生因为没有很好地掌握“矿床成因论”，被分配去检查钨矿时，遇到许多困难。第二次到钨矿时，他们带了一些参考书去，边学习，边工作，工作起来就方便多了。同学们通过这些亲身经历，回校后对各项专业理论的钻研都较前认真了。
    根据上述情况，南京大学地质系今年对各门基础理论课和专业理论课的学习时间都作了合理安排，除保证了一定的基础理论课和专业理论课的教学时间外，还增设了若干地质学领域中最新的理论知识课程，其中包括放射性和电子学等尖端性的理论课程。
    为了坚持贯彻理论联系实际的原则，这个学校地质系在加强理论课的同时，也决定今年8月以后，全系学生将再度到野外开展各种地质考察活动，以便在实践中检验他们学习理论的成绩。
