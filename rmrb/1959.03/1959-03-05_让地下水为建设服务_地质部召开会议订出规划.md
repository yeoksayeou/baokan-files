Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 4th -- The Ministry of Geology's First National Groundwater Dynamic Long-Term Observation Work Conference was held in Baotou City from February 24th to 25th. Ninety-eight representatives from geological bureaus, hydrogeology, and engineering geology teams of various provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, as well as relevant departments, attended the meeting.

The representatives discussed and clarified the important significance of actively carrying out long-term groundwater observation work for the development of the national economy. They formulated the working principle of "walking on two legs," combining professional observation stations with mass observation networks, and established a work plan.

With the great leap forward of China's national economy, the issue of groundwater utilization (including promoting benefits and eliminating harms) has become increasingly important, and it has a significant relationship with industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, transportation, and people's lives. Long-term groundwater observation is aimed at mastering the laws of dynamic changes in groundwater so that it can better serve socialist economic construction. Since 1956, geological departments have successively established many long-term groundwater observation stations and observation points in cities such as Beijing, Baotou, and Xi'an; large-scale water conservancy project sites such as Guanting and Sanmenxia; mining areas such as Huainan and Jiaozuo; and irrigation areas such as Jiangsu and Hebei. Last year alone, a general survey of groundwater was conducted on more than 690,000 square kilometers of land, groundwater conditions were explored in 34 cities, and hydrogeological and engineering geological surveys were conducted in more than 600 large, medium, and small reservoirs. This work has played a significant role in economic construction. For example, the Baotou Groundwater Dynamic Long-Term Observation Station of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Geological Bureau, based on nearly three years of observation data, recalculated the groundwater reserves in Baotou City, increasing the originally estimated groundwater resources by 100%, which is of great significance for the planning of Baotou's industrial construction. Through long-term groundwater observation, Jiangsu Province has mastered the relationship between dynamic changes in groundwater and increased wheat production. By changing the groundwater level, wheat in some areas has achieved high yields. Many provinces and regions have carried out mass groundwater observation work, achieved great success, and created rich experience.

    让地下水为建设服务
    地质部召开会议订出规划
    据新华社包头4日电　地质部第一届全国地下水动态长期观测工作会议2月24日到25日在包头市举行。到会的有各省、自治区、市的地质局水文地质、工程地质队及有关部门的代表九十八人。
    代表们讨论和明确了积极开展地下水长期观测工作，对国民经济发展的重要意义，制定了专业性观测站与群众性观测网相结合的两条腿走路的工作方针，订出了工作规划。
    随着我国国民经济的大跃进，地下水的利用问题（包括兴利除害）日益重要，它和工、矿、农、林、牧、交通及人民生活都有重大关系。地下水长期观测，就是为了掌握地下水动态变化的规律，使它更好地为社会主义经济建设服务。从1956年起，地质工作部门已相继在北京、包头、西安等城市，官厅、三门峡等大型水利工程工地，淮南、焦作等矿区，以及江苏、河北等灌溉区，建立了许多地下水长期观测站和观测点。去年一年，在六十九万多平方公里土地上对地下水进行了普查，在三十四个城市勘探了地下水的情况，在六百多个大中小型水库进行了水文地质工程地质勘察，这些工作对经济建设起了很大作用。如内蒙古自治区地质局包头地下水动态长期观测站，根据近三年的观测资料，重新计算出包头市地下水储量，比原来估算的地下水资源增加了一倍，这对包头工业建设的规划有重要意义。江苏省通过地下水长期观测，掌握了地下水动态变化与小麦增产之间的关系，经过改变地下水水位，促使部分地区的小麦得到高额丰收。许多省、区开展群众性的地下水观测工作，取得了很大成就，并创造了丰富的经验。
