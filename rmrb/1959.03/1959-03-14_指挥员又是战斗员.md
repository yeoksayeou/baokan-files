    Commander is Also a Combatant
    One evening in mid-February, we came to the First Management District of the Wuping People's Commune. We went to the spring irrigation headquarters, but it was empty. We followed the distant lights and found more than twenty strong young men digging a ditch to bring water to the highlands. They were all digging mud without even raising their heads, one spadeful at a time. Who was the secretary? We shouted several times before someone answered. It turned out that the red-faced man standing in knee-deep water, covered in mud, digging the fastest, and sweating the most, was none other than Li Lianzhong, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee. On the way back after work, he even challenged the commune members to see who could work faster and better tomorrow.
    In the evening, we stayed with the comrades at the headquarters. The next morning, at around five o'clock, before the night had fully retreated, they had all gone to work again. We quickly got up and rushed to the construction site. At this time, the commune members had already started their intense labor. We asked the commune members: "Who is digging the most today?" They said: "We want to compete with Secretary Li, you can come and see at the end of work tonight!"

    指挥员又是战斗员
    2月中旬的一个晚上，我们来到坞坪人民公社第一管理区。到春浇指挥部一看，空无一人。我们顺着远处的灯光走去，原来有二十多个身强力壮的小伙子，正在挖一条引水上高地的沟渠，个个头也不抬，一铣一铣地在挖泥。谁是书记呢？站在旁边连喊几声，这才有人答应。原来站在没膝的水中，弄得浑身上下好像泥人，挖土最快，出汗最多的那个红脸汉，就是公社党委副书记李连仲同志。在收工回来的路上，他还同社员们挑战，看谁明天干的快、干得好。
    晚上，我们同指挥部的同志们住在一起。第二天早上，大约五点多钟，夜色还未退尽，他们又都上工去了。我们也连忙起床，赶到修渠的工地上。这时，社员们又已展开了紧张地劳动。我们问社员：“今天谁挖得多？”他们说：“我们要和李书记竞赛，晚上收工时你再来看吧！”　　　　　　　　　　　　　河南商丘县委办公室通讯组
