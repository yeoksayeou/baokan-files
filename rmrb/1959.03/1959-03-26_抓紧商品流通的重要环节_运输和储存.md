Grasping the Important Links in Commodity Circulation – Transportation and Storage

Commodity circulation is the central link between commodity production and consumption; and commodity transportation and storage are two very important links in commodity circulation. Therefore, doing a good job in commodity storage and transportation is a very important aspect of doing a good job in commercial work, which is to organize commodity circulation well.

In 1958, the commercial departments' storage and transportation work, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels and with the close cooperation of relevant departments, achieved great success. In this year, hundreds of thousands of employees in commercial storage and transportation departments at all levels, regardless of day and night, rain or shine, completed huge storage and transportation tasks despite the large increase in storage and transportation volume, busy transportation, and insufficient warehousing conditions; and they also achieved great successes and rich experiences in organizing rush transportation, developing direct-line transportation, carrying out technical and cultural revolution and the “six-zeros and one-fast” movement in warehouses, and saving commodity circulation costs. These played an active role in expanding commodity circulation, accelerating commodity turnover, supporting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and meeting the needs of the people; and created favorable conditions for further improving storage and transportation work to adapt to the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in commercial work this year.

1959 is a year of even greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country. With the greater development of industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation will inevitably further expand. This brings greater and more arduous tasks to commodity transportation and storage work. On the other hand, under the situation of continuing to take steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, transportation capacity and warehousing conditions may not be able to fully meet the needs for a while. Under this circumstance, commercial storage and transportation work must implement the "nationwide coordination" policy, in the spirit of "giving way, assisting, and squeezing," properly arrange commodity allocation and transportation, first of all, ensure the allocation and transportation of key national materials and export materials, and strive to comprehensively complete the allocation and transportation of materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives; it must continue to implement the principle of "running warehouses diligently and thriftily" and do a good job in warehousing and storage work; and continue to use and promote the effective experience of 1958; only in this way can we complete this year's more arduous commercial storage and transportation tasks.

Embodying the nationwide coordination policy in commercial storage and transportation work is specifically reflected in the words "giving way, assisting, and squeezing." The so-called "giving way, assisting, and squeezing" is a set of working methods proposed by the commercial departments last year when supporting the ascent of the steel marshal. These three words vividly illustrate the relationship between the work of commercial departments and the central work; from the current point of view, it can be said that it is a working method that commercial departments should adopt in implementing the "nationwide coordination" policy. "Giving way" refers to commercial work making way for the marshal; "assisting" refers to commercial work fully supporting the steel and grain marshals; "squeezing" refers to commercial work squeezing into the central work to serve industrial and agricultural production and the broad masses of consumers, and completing commercial tasks. "Giving way" and "squeezing" are contradictory and opposite, but they are also unified, mutually dependent, and mutually connected. There must be "squeezing" if there is "giving way," and there must be "giving way" if there is "squeezing." Only "squeezing" without "giving way" will hinder the marshal's advance; only "giving way" without "squeezing" will affect the circulation of general commodities, affect market needs, and people's lives. Therefore, "giving way" and "squeezing" are dialectically unified. "Squeezing" is for "assisting," and "giving way" is also for "assisting." "Squeezing" and "giving way" are a pair of contradictions in the unity of supporting the marshal and supporting the central work. Understanding this relationship can enable us to give play to our subjective initiative and correctly handle this contradiction. In the work of commercial departments last year, especially in commodity transportation work, various places correctly applied this working method and created many good experiences. For example, when steel marshal transportation was tight last fall, the method of giving way was adopted for the transportation of general commodities. Some commercial departments in some areas proposed: "The marshal takes the main road, and the small road is taken by ourselves," letting the marshal's materials go by rail and general materials by wooden boats; or "The marshal goes ahead, and the logistics follow behind," adopting methods such as "the marshal carrying the logistics" and "piggybacking" to solve the transportation problem of some materials. In the gaps in the transportation of key materials, methods such as seizing the opportunity and filling in the gaps were adopted to rush-transport materials urgently needed by the market. This "giving way" is not a passive "giving way," but a "giving way with squeezing"; this "squeezing" is not an inappropriate "squeezing," but a "squeezing with giving way." These experiences are useful. In the work of commercial departments this year, especially in transportation work, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of "giving way, assisting, and squeezing," and continue to use and promote these experiences to ensure the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

After clarifying the guiding ideology of the work, we must also grasp the central links of the work. This year, in the transportation work of commercial departments, the central links are doing a good job in short-distance transportation and developing direct-line transportation.

Material transportation between urban and rural areas is generally called short-distance transportation. This is an important link in enlivening material exchanges between urban and rural areas and connecting regional economic work. It is an important link in the entire transportation process. If this link is not well organized, it will affect the entire transportation process and even affect production and circulation. With the substantial increase in the volume of material circulation between urban and rural areas, this year's short-distance transportation tasks will be more arduous. Therefore, Party committees in various places must attach importance to this work, strengthen leadership, take overall consideration, make comprehensive arrangements, and organize commercial departments and people's communes to cooperate and jointly do a good job in short-distance transportation. It must be clear that relying on the people's communes and the production teams of the communes, that is, relying on the masses to run transportation well, is the basic way to solve the problem of short-distance transportation.

To this end, Party committees in various places should help people's communes to make unified plans and properly arrange labor. According to different conditions in different regions, determine the proportion of transportation labor in the total labor force, arrange a certain amount of transportation labor while arranging industrial and agricultural labor; and assist people's communes in organizing professional material transportation teams in urban and rural areas. The advantage of professional transportation teams is that they can not only provide a reliable guarantee for short-distance transportation, but also facilitate the improvement of transportation technology and tool reform. For professional transportation team members, the distribution method of basic salary plus bonus or dead-level flexible assessment with more pay for more work should be adopted. In order to supplement the shortage of transportation capacity in the communes during the busy farming season and ensure the transportation of urgently needed materials, commercial departments can also prepare a certain number of transportation tools and organize transportation teams in commercial departments under the overall arrangement of the local Party committee.

Another central link in the transportation work of commercial departments is to comprehensively and deeply develop direct-line transportation. Taking the least amount of time, taking the shortest route, and spending the most economical cost are the basic principles of socialist commercial organizations in organizing commodity circulation, and it is also an important symbol for measuring the quantity, speed, quality and economy of transportation work. Direct-line transportation is an important method of organizing commodity circulation with quantity, speed, quality and economy by following this principle, taking measures to break administrative regions, cut off redundant circulation links, shorten circulation routes, and correspondingly improve procedures and systems. Since the launch of this work last year, certain achievements have been made. From a national perspective, the development of this work is still very uneven, and unreasonable phenomena such as roundabout transportation and transportation towards each other still exist to varying degrees. Therefore, this year we must comprehensively and deeply develop this work. Areas that have basically achieved direct-line transportation should further consolidate and improve; areas where some commodities have achieved direct-line transportation should sum up experience and comprehensively develop; and areas that have not yet developed should catch up quickly and develop rapidly.

While doing a good job in commodity transportation, commercial storage and transportation departments should also further carry out technical revolution, rationally use warehouses, and strengthen and improve commodity storage work.

Storing goods well and ensuring the safety of materials is the basic task of warehousing work. The large amount of materials stored in warehouses is the result of the hard work of the people of the whole country and also the material base point used by the state to ensure production and supply the needs of the people. Storing goods well is a glorious and important task entrusted to the broad masses of warehousing workers by the Party and the people. All warehousing workers must work hard to complete this task. Last year, commercial warehouses in many regions carried out the "six-zeros and one-fast" movement and achieved great results. This year, it is required to further improve on the basis of last year and develop it more widely, so that the warehouses of all commercial departments basically meet the "six-zeros and one-fast" standard. In order to further improve work efficiency, reduce costs, and enable employees to gradually get rid of heavy labor, it is also necessary to carry out a technical revolution movement centered on gradually eliminating heavy labor in warehousing work. In addition, this year's cotton production will reach 100 million dan, and the production of other agricultural and sideline products will also have a large increase. In the peak season when a large number of agricultural and sideline products are on the market, a considerable number of products will inevitably be stored in the people's communes. Therefore, in addition to the fact that Party committees in various places should inspect and supervise the people's communes to make preparations in a timely manner and do a good job in the storage and storage of agricultural and sideline products, commercial departments should also vigorously assist the people's communes in doing this work in terms of equipment, technology, and other aspects.

At the recent National Storage and Transportation Work Conference held by the Ministry of Commerce, the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in storage and transportation work last year were summarized, and the guidelines and tasks for this year's commercial storage and transportation work were determined; all the representatives attending this conference also put forward eight initiatives to all commercial storage and transportation workers as the fighting goals for this year's greater leap forward. At this moment, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a call to the employees in industry, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade to immediately launch a new and greater upsurge in production. We believe that hundreds of thousands of commercial storage and transportation workers will surely warmly respond to the call of the Party and the country, and take the "Eight Initiatives" as specific fighting goals, further boost their morale, and launch a new upsurge in commercial storage and transportation work with high spirits, and contribute greater and better achievements than last year to the National Advanced Collective and Advanced Producer Representative Conference of socialist construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, finance and trade.

    抓紧商品流通的重要环节——运输和储存
    商品流通，是商品的生产与消费之间的中心环节；而商品的运输和储存，则又是商品流通中的两个十分重要的环节。因此，做好商品的储运工作，是做好商业工作，也就是组织好商品流通的一个十分重要的方面。
    1958年商业部门的储运工作，在各级党和政府的领导下和有关部门的密切协作下，取得了很大成绩。在这一年中，各级商业储运部门的几十万职工，昼夜不分，风雨无阻，在储运量大增、运输繁忙和仓储条件不足的情况下，完成了巨大的储运任务，基本上适应了主要物资的调运和储存的要求；并在组织突击运输、开展直线运输、开展技术文化革命和仓库“六无一快”运动、节约商品流转费用等方面，取得了很大成绩和丰富的经验。这些，对扩大商品流通，加速商品流转，支援工农业生产的大跃进，满足人民需要，起了积极作用；并为进一步作好储运工作，适应今年商业工作更大更好更全面的跃进，创造了良好的条件。
    1959年是我国工农业生产更大跃进的一年。随着工农业生产的更大发展，商品流通必将进一步扩大。这就给商品的运输、保管工作带来了更大更艰巨的任务。而另一方面，在继续以钢为纲、全面跃进的形势下，运输力和仓储条件都一时还不可能完全适应需要。在这种情况下，商业储运工作就必须贯彻执行
  “全国一盘棋”的方针，本着“让、援、挤”的精神，妥善安排商品调运，首先必须保证有关全国性的重点物资和出口物资的调运，力争全面完成有关工农业生产和人民生活所需物资的调运；必须继续贯彻“勤俭办仓”的原则，作好仓储保管工作；并继续运用和推广1958年行之有效的经验；只有这样，才可能完成今年更加繁重的商业储运任务。
    在商业储运工作中体现全国一盘棋的方针，具体反映在“让、援、挤”这几个字上。所谓“让、援、挤”，是去年在支援钢铁元帅升帐时所提出来的商业部门的一套工作方法，这三个字形象地说明了商业的部门工作和中心工作的关系；从现在来看，则可以说是商业部门在贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针中应该采取的一种工作方法。“让”，是指商业工作要为元帅让路；“援”，是指商业工作要全力支援钢、粮诸帅；“挤”是指商业工作要挤进中心工作中去为工农业生产、为广大消费者服务，并完成商业任务。“让”和“挤”是矛盾的、对立的，然而又是统一的，互相依赖、互相联系的。有“让”必有“挤”，有“挤”必有“让”。光“挤”不“让”，就会妨碍元帅前进；光“让”不“挤”就会影响一般商品的流通，影响市场需要和人民生活，因此，“让”和“挤”是辩证的统一。“挤”为了“援”，而“让”也是为了“援”，“挤”和“让”是处在支援元帅、支援中心工作的统一体中的一对矛盾。懂得了这个关系，就能够发挥自己的主观能动性，去正确地处理这一矛盾了。在去年商业部门的工作中、特别是商品运输工作中，各地就曾经正确地运用了这一工作方法，创造了不少好的经验。例如在去年秋后钢帅运输紧张时，对一般商品的运输就采取了让路的办法，有些地区商业部门提出了：“元帅走大道，小路自己行”，让元帅的物资走铁道，一般物资用木船运；或是“元帅前面走，后勤后面跟”，采取“元帅带后勤”、“捎脚”等办法，解决了一部分物资的运输问题。在重点物资运输的间隙中，就采取见缝插针、有空就补的办法，突击挤运市场急需物资。这种“让”，不是消极的“让”，而是“让中有挤”；这种“挤”，不是不适当的“挤”，而是“挤中有让”。这些经验都是有用的，在今年商业部门的工作中，特别是运输工作中，仍然要继续发挥“让、援、挤”的精神，继续运用和推广这些经验，以保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现。
    在明确了工作的指导思想以后，还必须抓住工作的中心环节。今年在商业部门的运输工作中，中心环节就是作好短途运输工作和开展直线运输。
    城乡间物资运输，一般称为短途运输。这是活跃城乡物资交流和沟通地区经济工作中的一个重要环节。是整个运输全程的一个重要环节。如果这一环节组织不好将影响到整个运输全程，以至影响到生产和流通。随着城乡物资流通量的大大增加，今年短途运输任务将更加繁重。因此，各地党委必须重视这一工作，加强领导，统筹兼顾，全面安排，组织商业部门和人民公社进行协作，共同作好短途运输工作。必须明确：依靠人民公社、依靠公社的生产队，即依靠群众办好运输，是解决短途运输问题的基本途径。
    为此，各地党委应当帮助人民公社统一规划，适当安排劳力。根据不同地区不同条件，分别确定运输劳力在总劳力中所占的比例，在安排工业、农业劳动力的同时，安排一定的运输劳力；并协助人民公社组织城乡物资专业运输队。专业运输队的好处是不但能使短途运输有可靠的保证，同时也便于提高运输技术和进行工具改革。对专业运输队员应该采取基本工资加奖励或是死级活评多劳多得的分配办法。为了补充公社农忙时运力不足，保证急需物资的运输，商业部门在当地党委的统筹安排下，也可以自备一定数量的运输工具，并组织商业部门的运输队。
    商业部门运输工作中的另一中心环节是全面深入地开展直线运输。以最少的时间，走最短的路程，花最省的费用，这是社会主义商业组织商品流转的一条基本原则，也是衡量运输工作多快好省的一项重要标志。直线运输就是遵循这一原则，采取打破行政区域、砍掉多余的流转环节、缩短流转路线，并相应改进手续制度，多快好省地组织商品流通的一项重要办法。去年开展这一工作以来，已经取得一定的成绩。从全国来看，这一工作的发展还很不平衡，迂回运输、相向运输等不合理现象还不同程度地存在着。因此今年必须全面深入地把这一工作开展起来。已基本实现直线运输化的地区应当进一步巩固提高；部分商品实现直线运输化的地区要总结经验，全面开展；尚未开展的地区更应急起直追，迅速开展起来。
    在作好商品运输工作的同时，商业储运部门，还要进一步开展技术革命，合理使用仓库，加强和改善商品保管工作。
    保管好商品，确保物资安全是仓储工作的基本任务。仓库里储存着的大量物资，是全国人民辛勤劳动的果实，也是国家用以保证生产、供应人民需要的物资基点。保管好商品，是党和人民托付给广大仓储职工的一项光荣的重要任务，全体仓储职工必须努力地去完成这项任务。去年许多地区商业仓库开展了“六无一快”运动，成绩很大。今年要求在去年的基础上进一步提高，并更加广泛地开展起来，使所有商业部门的仓库基本上达到“六无一快”的标准。为了进一步提高工作效率、降低费用，并使职工逐步摆脱笨重劳动，还必须在仓储工作中开展以逐步消除笨重劳动为中心的技术革命运动。此外，今年棉花生产将达一亿担，其他农副产品生产也有很大的增长。在农副产品大量上市的旺季，必然有为数甚巨的产品储存在人民公社。因此，除各地党委应检查督促人民公社及时作好准备，做好农副产品的储存、保管工作外，商业部门也应该从设备、技术等各方面，大力协助人民公社作好这一工作。
    在最近商业部召开的全国储运工作会议上，总结了去年的储运工作大跃进的成绩和经验，确定了今年商业储运工作的方针任务；出席这个会议的全体代表并向全体商业储运职工提出了八项倡议，作为今年更大跃进的奋斗目标。正在这个时候，中共中央和国务院向工业交通基建财贸职工发出了立即掀起新的更大的生产高潮的号召。我们相信，几十万商业储运职工，一定会热烈地响应党和国家的号召，并以“八项倡议”作为具体奋斗目标，进一步鼓足干劲，意气风发地掀起一个商业储运工作的新的跃进高潮，拿出比去年更大、更好的成绩来，献给全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议。
