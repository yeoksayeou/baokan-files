Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" published an article by Italian Communist Party Central Committee member Pajetta on March 14th, refuting the unfounded attacks made by United Arab Republic President Nasser on the Egyptian Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party in a speech in Damascus on March 13th. In that speech, Nasser insisted that the Egyptian Communist Party was "an agent of foreigners" and had been "receiving instructions from the Italian Communist Party" since 1953.

Pajetta said, "It is difficult to understand what President Nasser's intentions were in his speech when he talked about the relationship between Egyptian Communists and Italian Communists; the hypocrisy of his speech is obvious. We can recall that among the Egyptian figures who have communicated with Italian Communists in recent years, there were Nasser's close aides; President Nasser himself also met with Comrade Spano, a member of the leadership of our party, and held sincere talks. At that time, as in other occasions, people have never made such absurd statements as now. President Nasser's statement cannot be based on facts; because the Egyptian Communist Party has never, nor intends to, accept orders from our party. We are confident that there has never been a relationship of accepting orders between the Egyptian Communist Party and the Communist Parties of other countries. As far as we know, the Egyptian Communists have always been ardent patriots, supporting the cause of Arab unity, and they have strived to make foreign countries understand the enormous significance of the Egyptian national movement; and when President Nasser does not attack the Egyptian Communists but strives to defend his country against the imperialists, they strike at those who attack Egypt or act as accomplices to aggression."

    意共中委巴叶塔著文
    驳斥纳赛尔对意共和埃共的攻击
    新华社18日讯  罗马消息：意大利共产党机关报“团结报”3月14日刊载了意大利共产党中央委员会委员巴叶塔的一篇文章，驳斥阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔3月13日在大马士革发表的一篇演说中对埃及共产党和意大利共产党的毫无根据的攻击。纳赛尔在那篇演说中硬说埃及共产党是“外国人的代理人”，自从1953年以来“就一直从意大利共产党那里接受指示”。
    巴叶塔说，“纳赛尔总统在他的讲话中，谈到埃及共产党人和意大利共产党的关系，很难理解他这样说居心何在；他的讲话的虚伪性质是昭然若揭的。我们可以追述一下：在这几年来和意大利共产党人进行过交谈的埃及人士当中，有纳赛尔的亲信；纳赛尔总统本人也曾会见过我们党的领导机构的成员斯巴诺同志，进行了恳切的会谈。在那时，和在其它场合一样，人们从来没有发表过像现在这样的荒谬的说法。纳赛尔总统的说法，是不可能有事实根据的；因为，埃及共产党人从来没有，也无意接受我们党的命令。我们确信：在埃及共产党与其它国家的共产党之间，也从来不存在接受命令的关系。据我们知道，埃及共产党人自始至终是热诚的爱国者，拥护阿拉伯统一事业，他们努力使外国了解埃及民族运动的巨大意义；并且在纳赛尔总统不攻击埃及共产党人而竭力保卫自己的国家以对付帝国主义者的时候，打击向埃及进攻或充当侵略的帮凶的人们。”
