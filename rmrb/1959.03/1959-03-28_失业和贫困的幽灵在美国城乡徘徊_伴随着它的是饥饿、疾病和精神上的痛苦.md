Reported by this newspaper: Although U.S. industrial production continued to recover somewhat in January and February this year, it is still lower than the level before the crisis in August 1957, and the unemployment situation remains very serious.

According to official statistics recently released, the U.S. industrial production index rose slightly in February compared to January, from 143 (1947 to 1949 = 100) to 144. This is still three points lower than the peak before the crisis: 147 in December 1956. At the same time, however, the number of unemployed people continued to increase, from 4,724,000 in January to 4,749,000 in February. This is more than two million higher than the number of unemployed before the crisis in August 1957. And the current unemployment figures do not include approximately 12 million underemployed people.

While U.S. officials continue to publicize increased production and rising profits, unemployment continues to worsen. Why is this the case?

A.H. Raskin, a "New York Times" reporter who recently visited some unemployed areas in the United States, said: This is because mechanization has greatly reduced the need for manpower. Now 68,000 people mine more coal than 125,000 people did ten years ago. It turns out that in order to maintain high profits, large monopoly capitalists in the United States have been trying their best to expand automated equipment in the production process and avoid hiring more workers. Therefore, the already very serious unemployment phenomenon cannot be alleviated by the recovery of production. On the contrary, it continues to worsen. For example, in December 1958, "General Motors" and "Ford Motor Company" produced 60,000 more cars than in the same period in 1957, but the number of employees was reduced by more than 33,000. Recently, although the U.S. steel industry has exceeded last year's output, the number of employees has decreased by 100,000 compared with the same period last year.

At the same time, the continued deterioration of the unemployment problem is also inseparable from the fact that the sales prospects of some of the U.S. industrial sectors with the most serious unemployment are still very bleak. For example, as one of the important pillars of the U.S. economy, the huge automobile industry had 500,000 more cars in stock at the end of February than in October last year, and the sales prospects for automobiles in 1959 still cannot help but make people worry, so they are preparing to continue to lay off workers. A.H. Raskin, a "New York Times" reporter who had just visited Detroit, reported that in Detroit, the center of the automobile industry, one in seven workers is now unemployed. In the next few weeks, thousands more workers may be unemployed. At present, the proportion of unemployed people in the U.S. automobile industry is as high as 10.3%. The proportion of unemployed people in the mining sector is even higher at 11.7%.

Due to the expansion of unemployment and its increasing long-term nature, the lives of unemployed workers in the United States are deteriorating, and tragedies of unemployed people committing suicide and selling their children due to the pressure of life have continued to occur. In particular, the lives of many people who have already received their unemployment benefits are the most painful. They wander the streets, unable to find a job. According to the "New York Times," three million unemployed people in the United States have now lost their right to receive unemployment benefits.

When talking about the plight of these long-term unemployed, the "New York Times" wrote: "Men and women wander the streets wearily month after month. They have gained nothing, only holes in their shoes and heavier and heavier debts. They show more confusion than anger."

"Business Week" also said: "When a person first tries to adapt to the painful reality of 'I am unemployed,' fear and shame are pressing. At the height of the economic recession, many unemployed people thought that they might find a job again after a while. But time is moving forward, and many people's unemployment benefits have run out, but they still have no job."

It can be seen from reports in American newspapers and periodicals that the area with the most serious unemployment in the United States is West Virginia, the center of coal mining. Half of the workers here are coal miners. After describing the serious unemployment situation in Detroit, the center of the automobile industry, and Pittsburgh, the center of the steel industry, a "New York Times" reporter admitted: "The long-term unemployment of a large number of workers in the coal mining area of ​​West Virginia is even more tragic." There, due to the downturn in the coal mining industry, more than 100,000 people have left their homes in recent years to find work. The unemployed account for 15% of all workers. The newspaper also published a photo of a store in Whedon, the state. In a spacious house full of goods, a lonely salesperson is sleeping. No one, not a single customer, has visited. In the past year alone, due to the spread of unemployment, retail sales in the state have fallen by 35%.

Most American newspapers and members of Congress also pointed out that serious unemployment is not limited to West Virginia. Senator Cooper of Kentucky said that the situation in the eastern coal mining area of ​​Kentucky is as bad as that in West Virginia.

Senator Douglas of Illinois also pointed out, "The specter of long-term unemployment and poverty is appearing everywhere in the streets and rural roads of many areas of this country. This state of unemployment is not a short-term problem; it has been like a suffocating coal dust spreading throughout West Virginia for several years; it has spread to New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, and vast areas of the South. It has also invaded the Midwest, Southwest, and the Far West."

Due to the impact of unemployment, residents in vast unemployed areas have difficulty in life, are attacked by diseases, and need to rely on food relief to maintain their lives. According to the "Daily Mail" of West Virginia, in twenty-four states in the United States, there are two hundred and nine areas where 15% to 50% of the residents rely on government food relief. The "New York Times" on March 16 also said that not only West Virginia, but also tens of thousands of families in other states are relying on this food relief. The line of people receiving food has almost doubled compared to a year ago. Now the number of people across the United States receiving government relief food has exceeded five million.

### 失业和贫困的幽灵在美国城乡徘徊  伴随着它的是饥饿、疾病和精神上的痛苦

    失业和贫困的幽灵在美国城乡徘徊
    伴随着它的是饥饿、疾病和精神上的痛苦
    本报讯　今年1、2月份美国工业生产继续有些回升，但仍然低于1957年8月危机前的水平，失业情况仍然十分严重。
    根据官方最近发表的统计数字，美国的工业生产指数在2月份又比1月份上升了一点。即从一百四十三（1947年到1949年为一百）上升到一百四十四。比危机前的最高峰：1956年12月的一百四十七仍差三点。可是与此同时，失业人数却在继续增加，从1月份的四百七十二万四千人增加到2月份的四百七十四万九千人。比1957年8月危机前的失业人数还要高二百多万。而现在的失业数字还没有包括大约一千二百万的半失业者。
    当美国官方仍在不断宣传着生产增加、利润上升的时候，失业却在继续恶化，这是什么缘故呢？
    刚刚访问了美国一些失业地区的“纽约时报”记者阿·赫·腊斯金说：这是因为机械化大大减少了对人力的需要，现在六万八千人挖的煤比十年前十二万五千人挖的还多。原来，最近美国大垄断资本为了保持高额利润，竭力在生产过程中扩大自动化设备，避免增雇工人。因此，已经十分严重的失业现象，并不能因生产回升而见缓和，相反地继续恶化了。如1958年12月“通用汽车公司”和“福特汽车公司”的汽车产量比1957年同期增加了六万辆，但雇用工人却减少了三万三千余人。最近美国钢铁工业虽然在产量上超过去年，但雇用人数反而比去年同期减少了十万人。
    同时失业问题的继续恶化，也是同美国一些失业最严重的工业部门的销售前景至今仍然十分黯淡分不开。例如，作为美国经济重要支柱之一的庞大汽车工业，在2月底汽车存货又比去年10月多了五十万辆，而1959年的汽车销售前景依然不能不使人感到担心，因而都在准备继续解雇工人。刚访问过底特律的“纽约时报”记者阿·赫·腊斯金就报道说：在汽车工业中心底特律，现在每七个工人中就有一个失业者。以后几个星期可能又会有成千的工人失业。目前，美国汽车工业中失业人数的比重高达10.3％。采矿部门失业人数的比例更高达11.7％。
    由于失业扩大并日益变为长期性，美国失业工人的生活愈益恶化，失业者为生活所迫自杀和出卖子女的悲剧已不断发生。特别是许多已经领完失业补助金的人的生活，最为痛苦。他们踟蹰街头，找不到职业。据“纽约时报”报道，现在美国有三百万失业者失去了领取失业救济金的权利。
      “纽约时报”在谈到这些长期失业者的处境时写道：“男男女女一个月又一个月疲乏地在街头徘徊，他们一点没有收获，只是他们的鞋子出现了窟窿，债务愈来愈重。他们流露的迷惑情绪多于愤怒情绪”。
    “商业周刊”也说：“当一个人第一次尽力适应‘我失业了’这样一个痛苦的现实的时候，恐惧和羞耻感就咄咄逼人。在经济衰退达到最高峰的时候，许多失业者认为过一个时候他们可能重新找到工作。但是时间在前进，许多人的失业补助金用光了，可是还没有工作。”
    从美国报刊的报道中可以看出，目前美国失业最严重的地区是采煤中心的西弗吉尼亚州。这里一半的劳动者都是煤矿工人。“纽约时报”记者在叙述了汽车工业中心底特律市和钢铁工业中心匹兹堡市的严重失业情况以后承认：“在西弗吉尼亚的煤矿区，大批工人长期失业的情况更加悲惨”。那里，在采煤业的不景气下，近几年来就有十多万人离开家乡外出寻找工作。失业者已占全体工人的15％。该报还刊载了该州惠登市一所商店的照片。在堆满货物的一所宽敞的大房子里，一个孤零零的售货员在睡觉。没有一个人，也没有一个顾客光临。仅在去年一年，由于失业的蔓延，这个州的零售额下降了35％。
    美国多数报刊和国会议员还指出，严重的失业并不仅限于西弗吉尼亚。肯塔基州的参议员库柏就说，肯塔基州的东部煤矿地区的情况像西弗吉尼亚一样糟糕。
    伊利诺斯州的参议员道格拉斯也指出，“长期失业和贫困的幽灵在这个国家的许多地区的街头和乡村道路上到处出现。这种失业的状态并不是一个短期的问题；它像一股窒息的煤尘在整个西弗吉尼亚州弥漫了好几年；它蔓延到新英格兰、中部大西洋沿岸各州以及南部广大地区。它还侵入中西部、西南部、最西部各地区。”
    广大的失业地区中的居民，由于失业的影响，生活困难，疾病侵袭，需要依靠粮食救济，以维持生活。据西弗吉尼亚州的“每日邮报”报道，在美国二十四个州中，就有二百零九个地区那里居民中15％到50％的人依靠政府的粮食救济。3月16日的“纽约时报”也说，不仅是西弗吉尼亚州，还有其他各州的成万个家庭，也在依靠这种粮食救济。领取食品的队伍几乎比一年前增加了一倍。现在美国全国领取政府的救济粮的人数已超过五百万人。
