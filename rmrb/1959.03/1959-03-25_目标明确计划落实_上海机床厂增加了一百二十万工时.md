Shanghai, March 24th (Reported by our newspaper) The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, in discussing its annual Great Leap Forward plan, pushed production tasks down to the grassroots level and then formulated the Great Leap Forward plans and measures for workshops and the factory from the bottom up. Through a repeated process of going to the masses and coming from the masses, the national plan was transformed into the practical actions of every worker. The factory's plans and measures gained a fully reliable mass foundation, and the process of mass discussion of the plan became a process of in-depth development of technological revolution. Originally, the factory's production tasks for this year were to double, but there was a shortage of 2 million work hours. This time, after mass discussion and the proposal of measures, about 60% of the shortage of work hours has been resolved.

The leading cadres of the factory, according to the spirit of making economic work more and more meticulous, raised the questions of "Can we achieve a greater leap forward this year?" and "How should we achieve a greater leap forward?" and mobilized the masses to speak out freely. In the speaking out, the masses put forward thousands of suggestions and measures related to achieving a greater leap forward. On this basis, the factory leaders then assigned the targets for variety, output, and output value to each workshop. The workshops, based on the parts processed by each production team, then formulated specific plans for each team and each type of work within the team, allowing the workers to discuss them. They also fully disclosed the difficulties in realizing the Great Leap Forward plan to the masses in the form of big-character posters, so that everyone could understand the key points of the entire factory and their own workshop. After the teams received the targets assigned by the workshops, they immediately launched discussions by type of work, calculated work hours, calculated equipment capacity, and then, referring to the key points raised by the workshops, aimed at the parts being processed, everyone thought of ways, everyone looked for tricks, and proposed innovative suggestions and measures to make up for the missing processing capacity. Finally, every worker of the same type of work formulated their own specific plans and measures based on the plan and measures discussed by the type of work. In this way, everyone had a clear goal, and everyone had measures to achieve the goal. The workshops and the factory summarized the specific Great Leap Forward plans and main measures at each level based on mass discussions.

Now, all the production workers in the factory have formulated plans and measures for their type of work and for themselves personally. According to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward targets, the drilling machine operators in the third team of the second workshop were to complete more than 32,000 work hours for the whole year, but their actual capacity was only 8,100 work hours. In response to this difference, the workers proposed seven measures, including making their own simple milling attachments and promoting multi-clamping and multi-drilling, and stipulated that they should be implemented in March, May, or June respectively. It is estimated that more than 14,800 work hours can be solved after implementation, and the remaining shortage is planned to be solved by cultivating multi-skilled workers and other methods.

Because the plan was brought down to every worker, the workers clearly understood the responsibilities they bore in realizing the Great Leap Forward plan, and thus further promoted their sense of ownership. Many workers said: "In the past, the task of completing the task was carried by a few people, but now all the workers in the factory carry it together." In the discussion of the plan, they aimed at the production key points of their own workshop, team, and type of work, carefully calculated accounts, looked for tricks, tapped potential, and proposed a large number of technical innovation suggestions. The gear processing team in the third workshop only completed a total of 80,000 work hours last year. After the workers proposed innovation measures, they can complete 200,000 work hours this year without increasing manpower or equipment. The workers of the entire third workshop proposed a total of 178 measures in the discussion of the plan. After the implementation of these measures, 70,000 work hours can be added to support fraternal workshops. After carefully calculating accounts and tapping potential for the first time, many workers saw that the processing capacity and task requirements were still not balanced, so they further calculated, tapped, and proposed innovative suggestions. In this way, the potential became greater and greater, and more and more measures were formulated.

Now, on the basis of mass discussion of the plan, the factory has further organized mass counterpart inspections and evaluations of machine tools to machine tools, teams to teams, workshops to workshops, and departments to departments, comparing the progressiveness, mass character, comprehensiveness, and reliability of the measures and plans. Through the evaluation, some of the measures and plans that were formulated more conservatively or unrealistically were revised. At the same time of evaluation and inspection, the factory also mobilized and organized workers to carry out a heated red flag competition between workshops and workshops, and between workers, centering on this year's doubling Great Leap Forward plan.

### 目标明确计划落实  上海机床厂增加了一百二十万工时

    目标明确计划落实
    上海机床厂增加了一百二十万工时
    本报上海24日电　上海机床厂在讨论全年跃进规划中，把生产任务一竿子插到底，再自下而上地逐级制订车间和厂的跃进计划和措施。经过到群众中去又从群众中来的反复过程，使国家计划变成每个工人的实际行动，厂的计划和措施有了充分可靠的群众基础，同时群众讨论计划的过程也成为技术革命深入发展的过程。原来，这个厂今年的生产任务要翻一番，却短少二百万工时。这次，经过群众讨论和提措施，短缺的工时，约有60％已经得到解决。
    这个厂的领导干部根据经济工作要越做越细的精神，提出“今年能不能实现更大跃进”以及“应该如何实现更大跃进”的问题，发动群众进行鸣放。在鸣放中，群众提出了成千上万条有关实现更大跃进的建议和措施。在这个基础上，工厂领导，就排出了品种、产量和产值的指标交给各车间。车间根据各个生产小组加工的零件，再排出各小组以及小组内各工种的具体计划，让工人进行讨论，并且把实现跃进计划中的困难用大字报形式详细向群众交底，使大家了解全厂和本车间的关键所在。小组接到车间下达的指标，即分工种展开讨论，算工时账，算设备能力账，然后参考车间提出的关键，针对加工部件，人人想办法，个个找窍门，提出革新的建议和措施来补足缺少的加工能力。最后，同工种的每一个工人又根据工种讨论的计划和措施，订出各自的具体计划和措施。这样就做到了每一个人都有明确的目标，每一个人都有实现目标的措施。车间和厂级就在群众讨论的基础上，层层汇总，提出具体的跃进计划和主要措施。
    现在，这个厂所有的生产工人都订出了工种的和个人的计划和措施。第二车间第三小组钻床工种，按跃进指标的要求，全年要完成三万二千多工时的任务，而实际能力只有八千一百工时。工人们针对这一差额，提出自制简易轧头具和推广多夹多钻等七条措施，分别规定在3月、5月或6月份实现。预计实现后可以解决一万四千八百多工时，其余不足之数准备用培养多面手等方法来解决。
    由于计划下到了每个工人，工人们清楚地了解到自己在实现跃进计划中所担负的责任，因此，就进一步发扬了主人翁的思想。许多工人说：“过去完成任务的担子少数人挑，现在全厂工人一齐挑。”他们在讨论计划中，针对本车间、本小组和本工种的生产关键，算细账、找窍门、挖潜力，提出了大量的技术革新建议。第三车间的齿轮加工小组去年总共只完成八万工时的任务，经工人提出革新措施后，今年在不增加人和设备的情况下，可以完成二十万工时的任务。整个第三车间的工人在讨论计划中提出的措施共有一百七十八项。这些措施实现后，可以增加七万个工时，用来支援兄弟车间。不少工人在算了一次细账，挖了一次潜力以后，看看加工能力和任务要求还是不能平衡，就进一步再算、再挖、再提革新建议。这样，潜力就越挖越大，措施也越订越多。
    现在，这个厂在群众性讨论计划的基础上，又进一步组织机床对机床、小组对小组、车间对车间、科室对科室的群众性的对口检查和评比，比措施计划的先进性、群众性、全面性、可靠性，通过评比，对某些订得比较保守或不切实际的措施计划进行了修正。在评比检查的同时，厂内又发动和组织工人，围绕今年翻一番的跃进计划，开展了车间与车间、工人与工人之间的热气腾腾的红旗竞赛。
