Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The National Forestry Science and Technology Conference, which concluded on March 5th, called on national forestry scientific workers to vigorously carry out research work and improve timber production technology, focusing on the goal of rapid and high-yield timber production. The conference determined that in 1959, rapid and high-yield cultivation experiments will be conducted nationwide on new and young forests of ninety-one timber and economic tree species. Rapid and high-yield indicators and measures for sixty-one tree species have been discussed and stipulated. The conference requested that all national forestry research units list this work as a key task.

The conference focused on discussing key research projects such as artificial wood, forestry chemistry, forest protection, and forestry mechanization, and determined the specific tasks for these projects this year. In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and in conjunction with local conditions, the conference balanced and arranged the forestry scientific research plan for 1959.

The conference pointed out that the purpose of carrying out scientific research on rapid and high-yield timber production is to fully meet the urgent need for timber and other forest products for the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, both in terms of time and quantity. In the past, people believed that forestry production generally required three to five decades, or even more than a hundred years, to yield results, and that it was a relatively extensive management undertaking. According to the experience of high-yield timber production in many regions since liberation and the results of scientific research, it has been proven that as long as we grasp several key factors for high yield, such as deep plowing, fertilization, rational close planting, strengthening tending, paying attention to soil and water conservation, timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and selecting superior varieties of strong seedlings, it is entirely possible for some fast-growing tree species to mature into timber in ten to fifteen years or a little longer, with a stock volume of 30 to 50 cubic meters per mu. For example, the eighteen-year-old Chinese fir in Jianfeng Cooperative in Jinping, Guizhou, has a stock volume of 48.5 cubic meters per mu; the eight-year-old Chinese fir in Jilang People's Commune in Huitong County, Hunan, has a stock volume of 19.1 cubic meters per mu. In addition, the yield of oil-tea camellias in some areas in the south exceeds 150 jin per mu in mature forests; the yield of walnuts in some areas in the north also reaches more than 100 jin per tree. These yields are dozens of times higher than the average yield of similar trees in the past. These facts point the direction for research on rapid and high-yield timber production.

The conference believes that the task of forestry scientific research in the future is not only to find out the ways and measures for rapid and high-yield timber production, but also to find out the ways to achieve this goal in a faster, better, and more economical way. To this end, it is necessary to conduct experiments with all possible high-yield measures for different tree species and regional conditions, and explore the possible limits of rapid and high-yield timber production under certain conditions. On the other hand, it is also necessary to compare various technical measures, observe, and explore new, most economical, and most effective methods. The layout of timber production should be based on the principle of local cultivation and local use, and priority should be given to the development of plains and timber-deficient areas.

The conference determined that the main directions of timber research in the future are: 1. How to rationally use timber and improve the utilization rate of timber, increase the output rate, and conduct research on anti-corrosion, drying, and timber properties to improve timber quality and extend the service life of timber; 2. Develop artificial wood using waste materials; 3. Find substitutes for timber, especially the comprehensive utilization of bamboo. The conference pointed out that in order to improve the effectiveness of scientific research, research results should be applied to production practice as soon as possible; both research work and promotion work should be valued.

The conference repeatedly emphasized that the leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee for the development of China's scientific undertakings.

This conference was convened by the Ministry of Forestry and the Chinese Academy of Forestry Sciences. Representatives of leading cadres and scientific workers in forestry science and technology from various provinces attended the conference, as well as representatives of forestry scientific workers from some people's communes and forestry labor models.

    找出林木速生丰产的捷径
    全国林业科学技术会议提出重点研究任务
    新华社10日讯　3月5日结束的全国林业科学技术会议，号召全国林业科学工作者围绕林木速生丰产的目标，大力开展研究工作，改进林木生产技术。会议确定：1959年中，将在全国范围内对九十一种用材和经济树种的新林和幼林，进行速生丰产的培育试验，其中六十一种树种的速生丰产指标、措施，已进行了讨论和规定。会议要求全国林业研究单位都把这一工作列为重点任务。
    会议着重讨论了人造木材、林业化学、森林保护、林业机械化等重点研究项目，确定了这些项目今年的具体任务；并根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，结合各地条件、情况，对1959年的林业科学研究计划进行了平衡和安排。
    会议指出，开展林木速生丰产科学研究工作的目的，是为了在时间上、数量上充分满足我国社会主义建设高速度发展对木材和其他林产品的迫切需要。过去，人们认为林业生产一般必需三、五十年，甚至百多年才有收获，而且是一种较粗放经营的事业。根据解放以来许多地区林木丰产的经验和科学研究的成果，证明只要抓住深翻、施肥、合理密植、加强抚育、注意水土保持、及时防治病虫害、选用良种壮苗等几项丰产关键，一些速生树种是完全可能在十至十五年或稍多一点的时间内成材，每亩蓄积量一般可达三十至五十立方公尺。如贵州锦屏建丰社十八年杉，每亩蓄积量达四十八点五立方公尺；湖南会同县吉朗人民公社八年杉，每亩蓄积量也达十九点一立方公尺。又如南方有些地区的油茶壮龄林亩产超过一百五十斤；北方有些地区的核桃单株产量也达到一百斤以上，都比过去同类林木的平均产量翻十几番到几十番。这些事实为林木速生丰产的研究工作指出了方向。
    会议认为今后林业科学研究的任务，不仅在于找出林木速生丰产的途径和措施，还必须找出达到这一目的的多、快、好、省的办法。为此，必须一方面针对不同树种和地区条件，采取一切可能的丰产措施进行试验，探讨林木速生丰产在一定条件下的可能限度；另一方面，还需要进行各项技术措施的比较、观察和探索新的最经济的最有效的办法。木材生产的布局，应以就地培育、就地使用为原则，并以平原地区和缺材地区为首先发展的对象。
    会议确定今后木材研究的主要方向是：一、如何合理使用木材和提高木材的利用率，提高出材率，进行防腐、干燥和木材性质的研究，以提高木材质量，延长木材使用年限；二、利用废材废料发展人造木材；三、寻找木材代用品，首先是综合利用竹材。会议指出，为提高科学研究工作的成效要尽快把研究成果用于生产实践；既应重视研究工作，也应重视推广工作。
    会议一再强调党的领导是发展我国科学事业的最根本的保证。
    这次会议是由林业部中国林业科学研究院召开的。参加会议的有各省林业科学技术工作领导干部和科学工作者代表；还有部分人民公社林业科学工作者代表和林业劳动模范。
