South American Public and Opinion
Protest U.S. Navy Exercises in Caribbean Sea

    (Reported by our newspaper) The current naval exercises and war preparations being conducted by the United States in the Caribbean Sea of the South Pacific and South Atlantic have aroused strong condemnation and protests from public opinion circles in South American countries.

    According to reports, this so-called "anti-submarine" naval exercise held in the Caribbean Sea was planned by the U.S. Department of Defense, with two U.S. fleets participating, led by Admirals Mustin and Stephen respectively. The United States also roped in the navies of eight countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, to participate in this exercise. The joint naval exercise between the United States and Venezuela in Venezuelan territorial waters has ended. Recently, the United States held joint naval exercises with Chile and Argentina in Chilean and Argentine territorial waters respectively, and also held joint exercises with the Uruguayan navy in Uruguayan territorial waters.

    In addition, TASS reported that the United States is stepping up war preparations in the South Atlantic. Many military missions sent to South American countries are building military bases and planning to conclude a South Atlantic Treaty. The news said that the United States is very interested in Argentina. Last year, it established a dedicated strategic air force base at the Ezeiza Airport in Argentina, stationed with 157 specially trained U.S. military personnel, who are implementing a special action plan called the "Three Points" plan. U.S. aircraft fly daily to Mato Grosso State in Brazil, Ecuador, and Antarctica. But the Americans insist that the air force base here was established "according to the International Geophysical Year program" and is intended to "study the upper atmosphere in the Southern Hemisphere." The news also revealed that in late February and early March this year, officers from the U.S. Air Force Command, led by Major General Hutchison, went to various parts of Argentina to inspect air force units. They also arrived in Chile and other Latin American countries to conduct activities for the same purpose.

    Public opinion in South American countries strongly condemned the U.S. military activities of trying to turn Latin America into its own base and tying these countries firmly to the U.S. war chariot. The National Youth Committee of the Argentine Peace Committee recently issued a statement, accusing the naval exercise as "part of a plan to turn Latin America into a base for atomic warfare for the benefit of foreign interests." The statement said: "We will never allow our beloved motherland to become a foreign base. Argentine youth are ready to shed blood to defend national sovereignty, but they are unwilling to fight brothers in distant battlefields to protect foreign interests." A statement issued by the Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party pointed out that "the Uruguayan people yearn for peace, friendship, and cooperation with the peoples of all countries, and yearn to develop trade and cultural relations with countries with different social systems. However, the purpose of this exercise is to drag our country into the world strategy of U.S. imperialism to invade socialist countries and those countries that have gained and are striving for political independence."

    Various trade unions and political organizations in Chile have condemned the joint military exercises held by the U.S. Air Force and Navy with Chile in Chilean territorial waters starting on March 19. According to the Brazilian newspaper "Ultima Hora," people from all walks of life in Brazil strongly protested against the United States conducting atomic bomb tests near Brazil. The news said that the Brazilian authorities have been constantly receiving letters from Brazilians demanding that the United States be stopped from conducting nuclear explosions in the South Atlantic.

    南美各国公众和舆论
    抗议美海军在加勒比海演习
    本报讯　美国目前正在南太平洋和南大西洋的加勒比海进行的海军演习和备战活动，引起了南美各国公众舆论界的强烈谴责和抗议。
    据报道，这次在加勒比海举行的所谓“反潜艇”海军演习，是美国国防部策划的，有两支美国舰队参加，分别由海军上将马斯庭和斯蒂芬率领。美国还拉拢了阿根廷、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉八个国家的海军参加这次演习。美国同委内瑞拉在委内瑞拉领海举行的联合海军演习已经结束，最近美国同智利和阿根廷分别在智利和阿根廷领海举行联合海军演习，也同乌拉圭的海军在乌拉圭领海举行联合演习。
    另据塔斯社报道，美国正在南大西洋加紧战争准备。派往南美国家的许多军事使团，在那里建筑军事基地并策划缔结南大西洋公约。消息说，美国对阿根廷很感兴趣。去年它在阿根廷的伊塞斯机场建立了一个专用战略空军基地，驻有一百五十七名经过专门训练的美国军人，正在实行专门的名叫“三点”计划的行动计划。美国飞机每天往巴西的马托格罗索州、厄瓜多尔和南极洲飞行。但美国人硬说，这里的空军基地是“根据国际地球物理年计划”建立的，目的是“研究南半球高空大气”。消息还揭露，今年2月底和3月初，以哈奇森少将为首的美国空军司令部的军官到阿根廷各地去视察空军部队。他们还抱着同样的目的到达智利和其他一些拉丁美洲国家活动。
    南美各国公众和舆论强烈谴责美国想把拉丁美洲变为自己的基地和把这些国家牢牢拴在美国战车上的军事活动。阿根廷和平委员会全国青年委员会最近发表声明，指责这次海军演习是“企图把拉丁美洲变为原子战争基地以利于外国利益的计划的一部分”。声明说：“我们决不容许我们可爱的祖国沦为外国的基地。阿根廷青年随时准备为维护国家的主权而流血，但是他们决不愿在遥远的战场上为保护外国利益而同亲如兄弟的人作战”。乌拉圭共产党执行委员会发表的声明指出，“乌拉圭人民渴望同各国人民和平、友好和合作，渴望同不同社会制度的各国发展贸易和文化关系。然而，这种演习的目的是想把我国拖入美帝国主义的世界战略中去，来侵略社会主义国家以及已经获得和正在争取政治独立的那些国家”。
    智利各工会及政治组织都谴责美国海空军3月19日起在智利领海同智利联合举行的军事演习。据巴西“最后一点钟报”报道，巴西各阶层人民强烈抗议美国在靠近巴西的地方进行原子弹试验。消息说，巴西当局曾不断收到巴西人士要求制止美国在南大西洋进行核爆炸的函件。
