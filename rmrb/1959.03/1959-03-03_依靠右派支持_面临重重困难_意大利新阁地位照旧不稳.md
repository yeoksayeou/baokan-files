　　Relying on Right-Wing Support, Facing Numerous Difficulties
　　Italy's New Cabinet Still Unstable

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Antonio Segni, a leader of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, formed a single-party government of the "pure" Christian Democratic Party. After being sworn in on February 16, it won a majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies on the 27th in a vote of confidence, temporarily ending Italy's government crisis.

　　Segni served as Italy's Prime Minister from 1955 to 1957. During his tenure, he appointed Toni, a representative of monopoly organizations, as Minister of State Investment; proposed a land tenancy reform bill that gave landlords greater rights; increased taxes, and increased military orders. Monopoly groups' profits increased by 31.6% in just one year. At the same time, he dismissed a large number of workers from state-owned enterprises, set off an anti-communist wave, and suppressed the people's movement. In two years, the number of fully and partially unemployed people in Italy exceeded four million. It was precisely this reactionary policy implemented by the Segni government that aroused strong dissatisfaction among the people, which led to the split of the "center-left" coalition cabinet and ultimately led to the downfall of the Segni government. However, judging from the policy program put forward by Segni after taking office this time, he has not changed his past reactionary policies in the slightest. And it is not much different from the Fanfani cabinet that fell not long ago. One of the differences is that the past practice of Fanfani, which focused on expanding the power of state monopoly capital, has been changed to focusing on expanding the power of private monopoly capital. As Agence France-Presse put it, "Segni will rely on private initiative investment to realize his plan, while Fanfani relied on state loans to help realize his reforms." It was precisely on this point that the extreme right wing within the Christian Democratic Party was dissatisfied with Fanfani. And Segni came to power precisely by relying on the support of this faction within his Christian Democratic Party.

　　This time, the Segni government is actually as unstable as the Fanfani cabinet. Because the Christian Democratic Party is in the minority in the parliament, it only occupies 274 seats out of the 596 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Therefore, the Christian Democratic Party alone cannot maintain a stable position and must rely on the support of other political parties. In this parliamentary vote of confidence, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and even the Social Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which have always teamed up with the Christian Democratic Party to form a coalition government, opposed Segni's one-party cabinet. Only by relying on the support of the extreme right-wing Liberal Party, which represents the big bourgeoisie and landlords, and the extremely reactionary Royalist Party and neo-fascists, was it barely able to come to power. Even Agence France-Presse admitted that the majority supporting the new government is not a real majority.

　　Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti recently pointed out that the Segni government of the right-wing Christian Democrats, which relies on royalists and fascists, will be opposed by the people. The democratic forces in Italy will not tolerate this reactionary alliance. Under such circumstances, even before the Segni cabinet officially took office, some Western news agencies had already been calculating the many difficulties facing Segni. These difficulties include: getting rid of economic recession; curbing rising prices; resisting strike waves; solving the unemployment problem of more than two million people, and even preventing the split within Segni's own Christian Democratic Party, etc.

### 依靠右派支持  面临重重困难  意大利新阁地位照旧不稳

    依靠右派支持  面临重重困难
    意大利新阁地位照旧不稳
    本报讯　意大利天主教民主党领袖之一、安东尼奥·塞尼组成的“清一色”天主教民主党的一党政府于2月16日宣誓就职后，27日在众议院信任投票中，获得了多数票，算是暂时结束了意大利的政府危机。
    塞尼在1955年到1957年间曾担任过意大利的总理。在他的任内，他曾任命垄断组织的代表托尼为国家投资部部长；提出给地主更大权利的土地租佃改革法案；增加税收、增加军事订货。仅仅一年中垄断集团的利润就增加了31.6％。同时，他大批解雇国营企业的工人，掀起反共高潮，镇压人民运动。两年来意大利国内全失业和半失业人数超过四百万。正是塞尼政府执行的这种反动政策激起了人民强烈的不满，从而导致“中间派”联合内阁的分裂，使塞尼政府最后垮了台。但是从这一次塞尼上台后所提出的施政纲领来看，他丝毫没有改变他过去的那些反动政策。并且和不久前倒台的范范尼内阁也没有什么很大的不同。其区别之一就是把范范尼过去的以扩大国家垄断资本势力为主的做法改为以扩大私人垄断资本的势力为主。照法新社的话来说就是“塞尼将依靠私人主动的投资来实现他的计划，而范范尼则依靠国家贷款来帮助实现他的改革”。正是在这一点上，天主教民主党内极右翼对范范尼产生了不满。而塞尼也正是在他的天主教民主党内依靠了这一派人的支持而上台的。
    这次塞尼政府实际上同范范尼内阁同样地不稳。由于天主教民主党在议会中处于少数派地位，它在众议院的五百九十六个议席中只占二百七十四个席位。因此，靠天主教民主党一个党是无法维持稳固的地位的，必须依靠别的政党的支持。在这次议会信任投票中，意大利共产党和社会党、甚至一直跟天主教民主党搭伙组织联合政府的社会民主党和共和党人都反对塞尼的一党内阁。而只是依靠了代表大资产阶级和大地主的极右翼的自由党和极端反动的保皇党和新法西斯党人的支持才勉强上台。这种情况连法新社也承认：支持新政府的多数不是一个真正的多数。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂最近曾经指出，依靠保皇党人和法西斯分子的右翼天主教民主党的塞尼政府将遭到人民的反对。意大利的民主力量不会对这种反动势力联盟抱容忍态度。在这种情况下，甚至在塞尼内阁正式上任以前，一些西方通讯社就已在替塞尼算计摆在他面前的重重困难了。这些困难有：摆脱经济衰退；遏止物价上涨；抵挡罢工浪潮；解决两百多万人失业问题，以至防止塞尼自己的天主教民主党内部的分裂等等。
