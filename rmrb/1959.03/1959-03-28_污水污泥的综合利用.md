Comprehensive Utilization of Sewage and Sludge
　　Jin Lang

When people talk about sewage and sludge discharged from cities or factories, they imagine it as something smelly and dirty, breeding mosquitoes and flies, growing bacteria and maggots, and worsening environmental hygiene.

Despite this, sewage and sludge also contain many valuable things. They contain a lot of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers needed in agriculture, especially nitrogen fertilizer. Generally, every ten tons of urban sewage contains one to two jin of nitrogen fertilizer, equivalent to five to ten jin of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate. If the national urban population is 100 million, and the average sewage volume per person per day is 30 liters, then the national daily discharge of urban sewage is 30 million tons, containing 3 million to 6 million jin of nitrogen fertilizer, equivalent to 15 million to 30 million jin of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate. If such a large amount of urban sewage is fully utilized every day, it will undoubtedly greatly benefit the development of the national economy. Sludge also contains many other useful things. People can not only make sewage and sludge harmless, but also actively use it to seek happiness for mankind.

In 1956, in Zhuzhou, Hunan, there was a drought and it hadn't rained for a long time. The farmland was cracked, and the seedlings in 700 mu of paddy fields were about to wither. Water became the only savior to rescue the seedlings at that time. However, near the drought-stricken farmland, the sewage from a factory flowed out continuously from the factory's sewage treatment station, passed by the drought-stricken farmland, and flowed into the small river in vain.

Some people wanted to use sewage for irrigation. Others thought it shouldn't be done, because it had never been used before. Some also pointed out that foreign literature not only had no records of sewage irrigation, but also clearly stated that sewage containing toxic substances should not be used to irrigate farmland.

After investigation, the average daily sewage discharge of this factory was about 2,300 tons. The nature of the sewage was mainly domestic sewage, with only 3% mixed with toxic industrial wastewater. Its toxic metals were mainly lead, chromium and fluorides. Before the sewage was discharged, it was treated by the factory's treatment station. The process was: the toxic industrial wastewater was first chemically treated with lime and ferrous sulfate, then mixed with domestic sewage, flowed through the grit chamber, double sedimentation tank, and then disinfected with chlorine before being discharged out of the factory. After such treatment, the content of toxic metals in the sewage was 0-0.15 mg/liter, while the nitrogen content was about 143 mg/liter. Obviously, this sewage had great irrigation value.

The local Party organization decided to conduct irrigation experiments. The result of irrigating 180 mu of drought-stricken land with sewage was that not only was it not harmed, but the yield per mu increased by 38%-50% compared with the land not irrigated with sewage.

In 1956, a similar thing happened in the Wannianqing Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs of Tianjin. The idea that "we cannot farm without chemical fertilizers" was very common among the farmers there. However, the supply of chemical fertilizers could not meet the needs that year. At that time, someone proposed using urban sewage discharged from the Tianjin urban area to top-dress farmland. Many people opposed it, believing that sewage would not only not act as fertilizer, but would also ruin the crops. The Party organization decided to use 150 mu of paddy fields as an experiment. As a result, this batch of fields yielded 800 to 900 jin per mu, which was more than the yield of fields using chemical fertilizers.

At the end of 1957, after studying the Agricultural Development Program, relevant scientific research units began to realize that the past goal of requiring high standards for treating sewage was a passive method, which was uneconomical and unrealistic. Today, the purpose of treating sewage should start from active utilization. Treatment methods and standards should all meet the requirements for utilizing sewage and sludge. Since 1958, relevant central and local units have systematically carried out experimental research on sewage irrigation and research on the treatment of urban sewage and industrial wastewater.

From the sewage irrigation farmland experiment in Qinghe Cooperative, Beijing, it was found that in the past, agricultural cooperatives spontaneously used very little sewage. They only used it for four or five months a year, and the rest of the time the sewage was still wasted. There was a good source of domestic sewage in Qinghe Cooperative, with an average sewage volume of 300 liters/second. The nitrogen fertilizer in the sewage throughout the year was 946,000 jin, equivalent to 4,730,000 jin of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate. It is estimated that the amount of sewage lost every year is 7 million tons, containing 700,000 jin of nitrogen fertilizer, equivalent to 3,500,000 jin of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union pointed out the direction for fully utilizing sewage: "Combine with local agricultural planning to achieve year-round irrigation of farmland." Through year-round irrigation of farmland with sewage, not only is the threat of river pollution eliminated, but also the investment in urban sewage treatment is greatly reduced. From the experiment in Qinghe Cooperative, it was concluded that sewage whose irrigation water quality is not problematic, such as urban sewage and harmless industrial wastewater, should be used for year-round irrigation. Non-growing season irrigation is mainly to store water and fertilizer from sewage in the soil, creating conditions for increasing the yield of the next crop. Soviet experience in sewage irrigation indicates that the yield of farmland irrigated during the non-growing season should increase by one and a half to two times.

Experiments on sewage utilization have proved that sewage can not only be used to irrigate farmland, but also to grow lotus roots, cultivate kelp, fish, and ducks, and breed chlorella, water hyacinth, and so on. Production practices in Qingdao and Dalian using sewage to cultivate kelp since 1958 have proved that each raft of sewage-cultured kelp can produce 17.2 tons, the longest plant is 7.5 meters long, the leaf is 60 cm wide, and weighs 3.5 kg. The vegetable body is dark brown and thick, reaching the specifications of national commercial kelp.

The mystery of the effectiveness of industrial wastewater has also been revealed. Raw materials can be recovered from wastewater, and after proper treatment, it can also provide water and fertilizer for farmland irrigation. For example, shale oil wastewater discharged into rivers can kill fish. However, when used to irrigate farmland, it is no longer necessary to apply fertilizer, and the rice yield per mu can reach 800 to 1200 jin. The results of pot experiments in the Shijingshan Experimental Zone in Beijing show that when the phenol concentration is treated to within 30 mg/liter and the oil concentration is within 100 mg/liter, irrigating crops can achieve increased production.

For example, lanolin can be recovered from the wastewater of woolen mills as a raw material for medicine and high-end cosmetics. Potassium carbonate is recovered from wool soil as an industrial raw material. Other wastewaters also contain fertilizer components, which can be used to irrigate farmland after simple mechanical treatment. In the experiment of Qinghe Cooperative in Beijing, the wastewater from the dyeing and finishing workshop of the woolen mill was mixed with one-third of the domestic sewage and irrigated farmland after mechanical treatment, which could increase the rice yield per mu by 50%.

Regarding the sediment sludge in urban sewage and industrial wastewater, in the past, it also caused headaches, just like a heavy burden on the shoulders of municipal construction agencies. In the past, the best and only way out was to use it as farm fertilizer. Using sludge in this way is a waste of talent and does not tap into all the wealth it contains. Research on the comprehensive utilization of sludge conducted in several cities in 1958 proved that sludge is a treasure trove for creating wealth for people.

From what has been excavated so far, in addition to being used as fertilizer, sludge can generate biogas and oils for fuel and power, and can also extract sludgein and antibiotics. The extraction of plastics from sludge has also been successful, but this is not all the wealth in sludge, and more and greater treasures remain to be further exploited by people who have mastered scientific weapons. With the development of comprehensive utilization, sewage and sludge will create more and greater wealth for people.

    污水污泥的综合利用
    金浪
    当人们一谈起从城市或工厂里排出来的污水和污泥，就会想像到这是又臭又脏，生蚊蝇，长菌蛆，恶化环境卫生的东西。
    尽管如此，但在污水和污泥中也含有许多有价值的东西。农业上需要的氮、磷、钾肥料，就含有不少，尤以氮肥最多。一般城市污水每十吨中含有氮肥一至二市斤，折合化学肥料硫酸铵相当于五至十市斤。要是以全国城市人口为一亿，每人每天的平均污水量为三十公升计算，则全国每天排出的城市污水量为三千万吨，氮肥为三百万至六百万市斤，折合化学肥料硫酸铵为一千五百万至三千万市斤。每天这样多的城市污水量如果全部利用起来，无疑将大大有利于国民经济的发展。污泥中还含有其他许多有用的东西。人们不但能使污水污泥无害化，还能积极地利用它为人类谋求幸福。
    1956年在湖南株州，天气干旱，久不下雨，农田龟裂，七百亩水稻田的禾苗眼看就会枯死。水成为当时挽救禾苗的唯一救星。可是就在干旱的农田附近，有一家工厂的污水，源源不竭地从厂内污水处理站流出，流过干旱的农田旁边，再白白地流入小河。
    一些人想利用污水来灌溉。另一些人认为灌溉不得，理由是从来没有用过。也有人提出外国的文献上不但没有污水灌溉的记载，还明白地说明：含有毒物质的污水是不能灌溉农田的。
    经过查明，这个厂每天排出的平均污水量约二千三百吨左右。污水的性质主要为生活污水，其中只有3％是混入了有毒的工业废水。它的有毒的金属主要是铅、铬与氟化物。污水排出之前经过厂内处理站的处理，过程是：有毒的工业废水先经过生石灰与硫酸亚铁的化学处理，然后与生活污水混和，流经沉砂池，双层沉淀池，再加氯消毒后，排出厂外。经过这样处理后的污水，有毒金属的含量为0—0.15毫克／公升，而含氮量在143毫克／公升左右。显然，这污水是有很大的灌溉价值的。
    当地党组织决定进行灌溉试验。一百八十亩受旱田引污水灌溉的结果，不但没有受到危害，反而每亩产量比未灌溉污水的增产38％—50％。
    1956年在天津西郊万年青农业社也发生过类似的事情。那里的农民“离了化肥不能种地”的想法很普遍。可是偏偏那年化学肥料供应不能满足需要。当时有人提出利用天津市区排出来的城市污水，追肥农田。不少人反对，认为污水不但不起肥料作用，反而会弄坏庄稼。党组织决定以一百五十亩水稻田作为试验。试验结果，这批田亩产八百至九百斤，比施用化肥的田增产更多。
    1957年底，有关科学研究单位学习农业发展纲要后，开始认识到过去要求高标准的处理污水的目的是消极的办法，是不经济、不现实的。今日处理污水的目的应该从积极利用着手。处理方法和标准都应适应利用污水污泥的要求。从1958年开始，中央和地方有关单位有计划地进行了污水灌溉的试验研究，和城市污水、工业废水的处理研究。
    从北京市清河社的污水灌溉农田的试验中，发觉过去农业社自发性地利用污水量很小。一年只利用四、五个月，其余时间的污水仍白白流失。清河社有一处很好的生活污水，平均污水量为300公升／秒。全年的污水中的氮肥就有九十四万六千斤，折合化肥硫酸铵为四百七十三万斤。估计每年流失的污水量为七百万吨，氮肥七十万斤，折合化肥硫酸铵三百五十万斤。苏联的先进经验给我们指出了充分利用污水的方向：“结合当地农业规划，实现终年灌溉农田”。通过农田终年灌溉污水，不仅消除了污染河流的威胁，同时也大大节省了城市污水处理的投资。从清河社的试验中，得出了灌溉水质没有问题的污水，如城市污水和无害工业废水应该用来终年灌溉。非生长期灌溉主要是使污水中的水和肥积存在土壤中，为下一茬的作物增产创造条件。苏联的污水灌溉经验指出，在非生长期进行灌溉的农田的产量，要增加一倍半到两倍。
    从污水利用试验证明，污水不但可以灌溉农田，还可以种藕，养殖海带、鱼、鸭，繁殖小球藻、水浮莲等。从1958年青岛、旅大利用污水养殖海带的生产实践证明，污水养殖的海带每台筏可以生产17.2吨，最长的棵有7.5公尺，叶宽60公分，重3.5公斤，菜体呈浓褐色而肥厚，达到国家商品海带的规格。
    工业废水效用的谜底也一样被揭开了。从废水中可以回收原料，并经过适当的处理后也可以提供农田灌溉的水和肥。如油母页岩石油废水排入河流能使鱼类死亡。但用来灌溉农田，就可以不再施肥，而使水稻产量每亩达800至1200斤。北京市石景山试验区的盆栽试验结果，说明这种石油废水在处理到含酚浓度30毫克／公升，含油浓度100毫克／公升以内时，灌溉农作物可以获得增产。
    再如从毛纺厂的废水中可以回收羊毛脂，作为医药和高级化妆品的原料。从羊毛土中回收碳酸钾作为工业原料。其他的废水还含有肥分，经过简单的机械处理后，可以灌溉农田。在北京清河社的试验中，毛纺厂中染整车间的废水和三之分一的生活污水混和后，经过机械处理，可以灌溉农田，而且能使水稻每亩增产50％。
    关于城市污水和工业废水中的沉淀污泥，过去也和污水一样，使人头痛，好似沉重的包袱压在市政建设机关的肩上。过去认为最好的也是唯一的出路，即是用作农田肥料。这样来利用污泥，毕竟是大材小用，远没有挖掘出它所蕴藏的全部财富。1958年在几个城市中进行的污泥综合利用的研究，证明污泥是为人们创造财富的宝库。
    从现在已挖掘出的东西来看，污泥除了已经可以用作肥料外，它可以产生供作燃料和动力用的沼气和油类，还可以提取污泥素和抗生素。从污泥中提取塑料也已获得成功，但这不是污泥中的全部财富，更多更大的宝贝还待掌握了科学武器的人们去进一步的开采。随着综合利用的发展，污水污泥将会为人们创造更多更大的财富。
