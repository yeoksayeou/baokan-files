Xinhua News Agency, March 17th. The first Beijing Western Medicine Doctors Off-the-Job TCM Study Class opened on the 16th at the Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Training School.

The seventy-five Western medicine doctors participating in this study class were selected from various hospitals and epidemic prevention and health units in Beijing. Among them are attending physicians, resident physicians, and also deputy directors. They generally have a college medical education level and two to ten years of clinical experience. Before entering this class, some students were active in learning Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and had participated in amateur TCM and acupuncture study classes. Some doctors have successfully treated some patients with TCM and Chinese herbal medicine in their clinical practice. From their personal experience, they have enhanced their urgent need to study and research the traditional medicine of the motherland.

In teaching, this study class will draw on the teaching experience of the Western Medicine Doctors Off-the-Job TCM Study Class held by the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Based on the principle of combining theory with practice and the characteristics of TCM, it will adopt a teaching method that combines classroom teaching, self-study, assisting diagnosis, and clinical practice. The students will first study the Party's TCM policies and Chairman Mao's works "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" to establish a dialectical materialism viewpoint, correct their learning attitude, and master correct learning methods. Then, they will study Chinese medical history, "Huangdi Neijing," "Shennong Ben Cao Jing," "Treatise on Cold Damage," "Warm Diseases," "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber," formulas, as well as internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture, massage, and other clinical courses in stages. Through the study, they will master the basic theory of TCM and the basic principles of treatment. Finally, under the guidance of teachers, the students will conduct clinical practice, summarize the treatment principles of some cases, and carry out some sorting and research work on TCM.

    选拔优秀西医离职学中医
    北京市西医离职学习中医班开学
    新华社17日讯　北京市第一次举办的西医离职学习中医班，16日在北京市中医进修学校开学。
    参加这个学习班学习的七十五名西医，是从北京市各医院、防疫卫生单位选拔出来的，其中有主治医师、住院医师，也有副院长。他们一般具有高等医学院校毕业水平，并有二年到十多年的临床经验。有的学员，在这次入学前是学习中医的积极分子，曾参加过业余中医、针灸等学习班的学习；有些医师在临床中曾试用中医中药治好过一些病人。他们从亲身的体会中增强了学习、研究祖国传统医学的迫切要求。
    这个学习班在教学上要吸取中医研究院举办的西医离职学习中医班的教学经验，根据理论联系实际的方针和中医的特点，采取课堂讲授、自学、佐诊和临床实习相结合的方法进行教学。学员们将首先学习党的中医政策和毛主席的著作“矛盾论”、“实践论”等，以便树立辩证唯物主义观点，端正学习态度，掌握正确的学习方法。然后分阶段学习中国医学史、内经、本草经、伤寒论、温病、金匮要略、方剂以及内外科、针灸、按摩等临床课程，通过学习要掌握中医学的基本理论和治疗的基本法则。最后，学员们将在老师的指导下进行临床实习，并总结部分病例的治疗原理和进行一些中医药的整理研究工作。
