Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 4th. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, arrived in Leipzig on the afternoon of the 4th. He said at a mass rally in Leipzig welcoming him that we advocate resolving mature international issues, and we advocate concluding a German peace treaty and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. However, the ruling groups in Western countries have rejected our peaceful proposals on the German question and are trying to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin with various intimidation tactics. This approach will not be successful.

Khrushchev said that as long as the German Democratic Republic is willing to sign a peace treaty, we will sign it, even if the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is unwilling to sign it.

That afternoon, a light rain fell in Leipzig. By 2 p.m., Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz was packed with tens of thousands of people. When Khrushchev, accompanied by leaders of the German Democratic Republic such as Ulbricht, stepped onto the podium, warm applause and cheers erupted from the crowd. Colorful balloons rose into the air, doves of peace flew across the sky, and beautiful fireworks were set off in the square.

Khrushchev spoke at the mass rally. He said that we say to the rulers of Western countries: Let us hold a conference with representatives from both Germanys to conclude a German peace treaty. The treaty can rule out the possibility of the revival of aggressive German militarism. This will be a major contribution to easing international tensions and create a good prerequisite for representatives of the two Germanys to reach an agreement on ways to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. We reiterate that there is only one way to peacefully restore German unity, and that is through negotiations between the two de facto sovereign Germanys, and for the Germans themselves to decide the way.

However, the ruling groups in Western countries have rejected our peaceful proposals on the German question and have not put forward any proposals that are reasonable and in line with the German situation. They even threatened to use force if we refuse to maintain the occupying position in West Berlin and transfer the function of controlling traffic between West Berlin and West Germany to the authorities of the German Democratic Republic.

But no matter how crazy those who want to maintain international tensions and disallow the elimination of the "Cold War" are, they will not get anything out of this.

Khrushchev emphasized: "What is our attitude—the attitude of the Soviet Union, the attitude of socialist countries, the attitude of all peace-loving people? What do we want? Peace, peace, peace!" He continued: "What will the signing of a peace treaty bring to the people of all countries? It will bring peace, peace, peace!"

Khrushchev pointed out that those who oppose the conclusion of a German peace treaty are trying to maintain a state of war. But those who shout for war do not want to fight themselves. Those who fight, bleed, and sacrifice are basically ordinary people, the people. The peoples of the Soviet Union and the German people have experienced two world wars, and they have fought each other in bloody wars. We have had enough of the taste of these wars. We do not need war; we need peace.

Khrushchev said, therefore, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, I declare: Let those who are responsible for ensuring world peace be wiser, come and sign a German peace treaty and eliminate the remnants of the last world war.

Khrushchev also talked about the significance of the Leipzig Fair. He pointed out that the continuous increase in participants and visitors to the Leipzig Fair reflects the growing fraternal economic cooperation between the countries of the socialist camp. It also shows that the role and prestige of the German Democratic Republic, a country with a highly developed economy and technology, is constantly increasing. The success of the Leipzig Fair also reflects the growing demand of ordinary people and business people in capitalist countries to expand trade and other forms of peaceful economic cooperation with socialist countries, and to have peaceful coexistence between countries with different socio-economic systems. He said that Leipzig has become an important place for friendly and trade exchanges between representatives of the East and the West.

Speaking about the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, Khrushchev said that we see the completion of the Seven-Year Plan as a decisive stage in the competition with the capitalist world. According to economists' calculations, due to the completion and overfulfillment of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, and due to the high-speed development of the people's democratic countries, the countries of the world socialist system will produce more than half of the world's industrial products. This is the most reliable guarantee for maintaining lasting peace on Earth. He went on to say that maintaining peace and preventing new destructive wars are the most important conditions for realizing the various plans and prospects we have formulated for further developing the economy. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government, with the support of the countries of the socialist camp, is so active in the struggle to peacefully resolve all pressing international issues.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, spoke next. He said that all residents of the German Democratic Republic and peace-loving people in West Germany are pleased with Khrushchev's visit. He emphasized that the people of the German Democratic Republic are proud of their friendship with the Soviet people.

Ulbricht expressed gratitude to the Soviet government for its proposal to conclude a German peace treaty and to hold a conference for this purpose. Ulbricht said that this is the way to strengthen peace in Europe. The peace treaty opens the door to a bright future for the German people. He said that fourteen years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the German people have the right to conclude a peace treaty.

Ulbricht said that if West Germany refuses to sign a peace treaty, the government of the German Democratic Republic will take into account the will of the German people and conclude a peace treaty without the participation of the Adenauer government.

Ulbricht pointed out that the Leipzig International Fair proves the increasing international prestige of the German Democratic Republic. The fair is a symbol of the role that a unified and peaceful Germany should play.

Ulbricht then pointed out the role of the German Democratic Republic as a bastion of peace. He said that only here can the German people breathe freely and work creatively. Ulbricht assured Khrushchev and the entire Soviet people that the working people of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to restore the unity of Germany.

Khrushchev and Ulbricht's speeches were repeatedly interrupted by storms of applause and shouts of "Friendship!" and "Hurrah!"

    赫鲁晓夫在来比锡群众大会上讲话
    签订对德和约将给各国人民带来和平
    乌布利希说没有西德参与德意志民主共和国也要签订和约
    新华社来比锡4日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫4日下午到达来比锡。他在来比锡市欢迎他的群众大会上说，我们主张解决已经成熟的国际问题，我们主张缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度。可是，西方国家统治集团拒绝了我们关于德国问题的和平建议，并试图以种种恫吓手段来维持西柏林的占领制度。这种做法是不会有结果的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，只要德意志民主共和国愿意签订和约，我们就签订，甚至在德意志联邦共和国政府不愿意签订和约情况下我们也要签订。
    这天下午，来比锡细雨纷飞，下午两点钟威廉·洛伊施纳广场上就挤满了成千上万的人群。当赫鲁晓夫由德意志民主共和国领导人乌布利希等陪同走上讲台时，人群中发出了热烈的鼓掌和欢呼，这时广场上升起了彩色缤纷的气球，和平鸽也从天空飞过，广场上还放出了美丽的焰火。
    赫鲁晓夫在群众大会上讲了话。他说，我们对西方国家的统治者说：让我们来召开有两个德国的代表参加的和会，缔结对德和约吧，和约能排除侵略性的德国军国主义复活的可能性。这将是对缓和国际紧张局势的重大贡献，并能创造良好的前提，使两个德国的代表相互之间就建立统一的爱好和平的民主的德国的途径问题达成协议。我们重申，和平恢复德国统一的途径只有一条，这就是通过两个事实上存在的有主权的德国之间的谈判，由德国人自己来决定的途径。
    但是，西方国家统治集团拒绝了我们关于德国问题的和平建议，也没有提出任何符合理智和德国形势的建议。它们甚至威胁说，如果我们拒绝维持西柏林的占领地位和把西柏林同西德之间的交通控制职能移交给德意志民主共和国当局，就要使用武力。
    但是，无论那些想要保持国际紧张关系和不允许消除“冷战”状态的人们怎样疯狂，他们都不能从这里得到任何结果。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说：“我们的态度——苏联的态度、社会主义国家的态度、一切爱好和平的人民的态度怎样呢？我们希望的是什么呢？和平、和平、和平！”他继续说：“签订和约会给各国人民带来什么呢？它将带来和平、和平、和平！”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，那些反对缔结对德和约的人是在想保持战争状态。但是，叫嚷战争的人并不想亲自打仗。打仗、流血、牺牲的人基本上都是普通人，是人民。苏联各族人民、德国人民经历了两次世界大战，他们在流血的战争中互相打过，我们对这些战争的味道尝够了，我们不需要战争，需要和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，因此，我代表苏联政府，代表苏联人民声明：让那些对保障世界和平负有责任的人更加明智些吧，来签订对德和约并消除上次世界大战的残余吧。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到了来比锡博览会的意义，他指出，来比锡博览会参加者和参观者的不断增加，反映了社会主义阵营各国之间兄弟般的经济合作在日益发展。这也说明德意志民主共和国这个拥有高度发达的经济和技术的国家的作用和威望在不断提高。来比锡博览会的成功也反映了资本主义国家所有的普通人和工商界人士日益要求同社会主义各国扩大贸易和其他形式的和平经济合作，要求社会经济制度不同的国家和平共处。他说，来比锡已经成为东西方代表进行友好和贸易交往的重要地方。
    在谈到苏联的七年计划时，赫鲁晓夫说，我们把七年计划的完成看作是同资本主义世界竞赛中的决定性阶段。根据经济学家的计算，由于完成和超额完成苏联七年计划，以及由于人民民主国家经济的高速度发展，世界社会主义体系的国家将生产全世界工业产品的一半以上。这是维护地球上持久和平的最可靠的保证。他接着说，维护和平、防止新的毁灭性的战争是实现我们所拟定的进一步发展经济的各种计划和前景的最重要的条件。正是由于这个缘故，苏联政府在社会主义阵营各国的支持下，在争取和平解决一切迫切的国际问题的斗争中表现得这样积极。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希接着讲话。他说，德意志民主共和国全体居民，西德爱好和平的人们都对赫鲁晓夫的访问感到高兴。他强调指出，德意志民主共和国人民为他们同苏联人民的友谊而骄傲。
    乌布利希对苏联政府表示感谢，感谢他提出的签订对德和约和为此召开和会的建议。乌布利希说，这是加强欧洲和平的途径。和约为德国人民打开通向美好未来的大门。他说，大战结束已经十四年了，德国人民有权利缔结和约。
    乌布利希说，如果西德拒绝签订和约，德意志民主共和国政府就要照顾到德国人民的意志，在没有阿登纳政府的参与下缔结和约。
    乌布利希指出，来比锡国际博览会证明了德意志民主共和国国际威望的提高。博览会是统一的和平的德国应该起的作用的象征。
    乌布利希接着指出了德意志民主共和国作为和平堡垒的作用。他说，只有在这里，德国人民才能自由地呼吸和创造性地劳动。乌布利希向赫鲁晓夫，向全体苏联人民保证说，德意志民主共和国劳动人民将尽一切努力来恢复德国的统一。
    赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希的讲话一再被暴风雨般的掌声和“友谊！”“乌拉！”的欢呼声打断。
