    Nanhui County's Experience in Achieving High Yields of Rapeseed

    How to make rapeseed achieve more branching, more pods and seeds, and full grains? Nanhui County in Shanghai has summarized successful experiences in this regard—successfully managing the three crucial stages of bolting, flowering, and harvesting.

    In 1958, the national average rapeseed yield was only 73 jin, while Nanhui County achieved an average yield of 252.85 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching 743 jin, becoming a banner for high rapeseed yields nationwide. The specific experiences of Nanhui County are as follows.

    When the Shengli rapeseed is bolting, its main inflorescence continuously grows, and branches grow densely, with flower buds appearing. At this time, a large amount of fertilizer is needed to promote its growth and development. With sufficient fertilizer, the main inflorescence will be strong, with more branches and more flower buds. Rapeseed belongs to the vegetable type, and the fertilizer required is mainly nitrogen fertilizer.

    Last year, Nanhui County's 30,000 mu of rapeseed fields applied an average of about 20 dan of night soil per mu during bolting. In Yaoqiao Brigade of Zhoupu Commune, 2 mu of Class 3 seedling rapeseed were fertilized with 20 dan of night soil and 10 jin of fertilizer powder per mu during bolting, resulting in an average yield of 372 jin per mu, which was 23% higher than the large-area yield of the entire commune.

    Applying fertilizer again before and after topping can promote the robust branching of rapeseed and more pod formation. When rapeseed is about to flower, if the leaves are light green, it indicates that the fertilizer is insufficient, and heavy fertilizer should be applied before topping; if the rapeseed leaves are dark green, indicating sufficient fertilizer, fertilizer can be applied after topping or the amount of fertilizer can be appropriately reduced.

    Increasing the application of flower fertilizer can appropriately reduce the number of empty pods and increase yield. Empty pods are pods that do not bear fruit after flowering. According to surveys, the empty pod rate per rapeseed plant generally reaches 20% to 30%. Insufficient nutrition in the later stage of rapeseed growth is one of the causes of empty pods. In Zhoupu Commune, the empty pod rate of one rapeseed field that was not fertilized with flower fertilizer was 10% higher than that of a field that was fertilized with flower fertilizer.

    Another measure to enable rapeseed to have more branches and more pods is timely topping. Farmers in Nanhui County have always attached importance to topping, saying, "Without topping, there is only one 'peak' (i.e., only one main inflorescence); with topping, there are 'peaks' on all sides (i.e., many branches)."

    Regarding the timing and method of topping, according to their experience, the following principles are followed: top later if there is sufficient fertilizer, top earlier if there is insufficient fertilizer, top later if the density is high, and top earlier if the density is low. In specific control, topping is generally carried out when the rapeseed flower panicle begins to elongate, that is, when the flower buds are about to bloom, removing about half an inch of the flower panicle.

    Timely harvesting is the final step to ensure a bumper harvest. Rapeseed has an indeterminate inflorescence, gradually flowering and forming pods from bottom to top, with a very long flowering period and uneven pod maturity time. If it is not harvested in time, early-maturing pods will open and shed grains, resulting in great losses. Farmers in Nanhui County generally harvest when two-thirds of the rapeseed plants are loquat-colored.

    The rapeseed is harvested by pulling it out by the roots, which allows the roots, which still store some nutrients, to continue to supply the rapeseed plants to complete their after-ripening. In order to ensure that the rapeseed grains return home, harvesting should be done in the early morning or evening to prevent the pods from cracking due to sun exposure. When bundling, bed sheets and other objects should be laid on the ground to collect fallen grains.

    This year, Nanhui County in Shanghai has learned from last year's rapeseed production experience and has seized the "deep plowing, close planting, cultivating strong seedlings, and wide ridges and high furrows" and other yield-increasing measures from the beginning, successfully managing the previous three stages of "seedling cultivation, transplanting, and frost prevention"; they are currently strengthening organizational leadership, strengthening technical measures, and improving field management, striving for a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu.

    南汇县油菜丰产经验
    怎样使油菜达到分枝多、结荚结籽多、籽粒个个饱满？上海市南汇县在这方面总结出了成功的经验——过好抽苔、开花、收获三大关。
    1958年，全国油菜平均产量只有七十三斤，而南汇县平均亩产达到二百五十二点八五斤，最高产量七百四十三斤，是全国油菜高产的一面旗帜。南汇县的具体经验有下面几点。
    在胜利油菜抽苔时，它的主花序不断生长，分枝丛生，出现花蕾。这时需要大量施肥促进它的生长发育。肥料充足，主花序就粗壮，分枝多，花蕾多。油菜属于蔬菜类型，所需肥料以氮肥为主。
    去年南汇县三万亩油菜田，在抽苔时每亩平均施人粪二十担左右。周浦公社姚桥大队二亩三类苗油菜，抽苔时每亩施二十担人粪、肥田粉十斤，平均每亩产量三百七十二斤，结果比全社大面积产量高23％。
    在摘心前后再施一次临花肥，可促使油菜分枝粗壮、多结荚。油菜在将要开花时，若叶子呈淡绿色时，表明肥料不足，就要在摘心前施重肥；若油菜叶子呈浓绿色时，这时肥料比较充足，可以在摘心以后施肥或适当减少施肥量。
    增施花肥可以适当减少阴荚，增加产量。阴荚就是开花后结的不实之荚。据调查，每株油菜阴荚率一般达到20％到30％。油菜后期生长营养不足是造成阴荚的原因之一。周浦公社有两块油菜田，其中一块未施花肥的，阴荚率比施过花肥的一块多10％。
    使油菜分枝多、多结荚的另一措施是适时摘心。南汇县农民一向就重视摘心，他们说：“不摘心，一根峰（即只有一根主花序），摘了心，四面峰（即分枝多）。”
    关于摘心的时间和做法，根据他们的经验，掌握这样几个原则：肥料足的晚一点摘，肥料少的早一些摘，密度大的晚一点摘，密度小的早一点摘。在具体掌握上，一般在油菜花盘开始伸长的时候，即花蕾将要开花的时候摘心，把花盘摘去半寸左右。
    适时收获，是保证丰产丰收的最后一关。油菜是无限花序，由下而上逐渐开花结荚，花期甚长，果荚成熟时间不一，不及时收获，早熟荚就要开口落粒，损失很大。南汇县农民一般掌握油菜已有三分之二的植株呈枇杷色时，即行收获。
    油菜收获方式采取连根拔，这样可以使还储藏一部分养分的根起继续供应油菜植株完成后熟的作用。为了使油菜籽颗粒还家，应在早晚收获，防止日晒裂荚。在捆扎时，地上铺被单等物，以便收集落粒。
    今年，上海市南汇县吸取去年的油菜生产经验，一开头就抓紧了“深耕、密植、育壮秧、阔埨高畦”等增产措施，胜利地过好了前期“育秧、移栽、防冻”三关；他们目前又正在加强组织领导，加强技术措施、搞好田间管理，力争亩产超千斤。
