(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: From American newspaper reports, it is evident that the United States is making every effort to salvage some remaining dictatorial regimes in Latin America, which are facing increasingly strong opposition from the people of various countries.

According to a report from Washington today by "New York Times" reporter Kennett Love, the U.S. State Department has decided to support the Duvalier regime in Haiti, believing that the overthrow of this dictatorial regime "would plunge Haiti into complete chaos." It has been previously reported that the United States sent a naval mission to Haiti last month to "train" the local army. The U.S. State Department has now decided to provide the Duvalier regime with financial and other assistance.

Dominican dictator Trujillo, who also relies on American support to maintain his rule, is also rushing to help Duvalier. In December of last year, they signed a so-called "anti-communist treaty." At the time, the "Washington Post and Times-Herald" wrote that this treaty was aimed at all those who were dissatisfied with the dictatorial regime.

The newspapers emphasized that Haitian prisons are full of political prisoners, and torture is commonplace. Now, not only the people but even some in the army are very dissatisfied with the current regime. A "New York Times" reporter reported from Port-au-Prince (Haiti) today that the Dominican dictator's troops, with the consent of the Haitian government, have occupied the strategic point of Malpasse on the border, from where they can quickly cross the border to help the Haitian authorities suppress the people.

In Paraguay, it has been revealed that, in view of the Paraguayan people's strong opposition to the dictatorial regime, the United States is brewing a political conspiracy aimed at preserving the dictatorship. The American magazine "Vision" recently reported that some personnel from foreign embassies in Paraguay have made predictions about the development of the situation in Paraguay, believing that the current Paraguayan dictator Stroessner is likely to nominate another member of his party as "president." The candidate for this "new president" is Gustavo Storm, the director of the Central Bank of Paraguay. The magazine said that Storm intends to take a trip to the United States.

    拉丁美洲独裁政权不稳
    美国主子慌忙出面撑腰
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：从美国报纸消息看出，美国正在千方百计地力图挽救拉丁美洲一些残余的独裁政权，这些独裁政权正遭到各国人民群众日益强烈的反对。
    据“纽约时报”记者肯华赛今天自华盛顿报道，美国国务院决定支持在海地的杜瓦利埃政权，它认为这个独裁政权被推翻“会使海地陷于全盘混乱”。前已报道，美国上个月已经派了一个海军使团去海地“训练”当地军队。美国国务院现在已经决定给予杜瓦利埃政权财政援助和其他援助。
    多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略也赶忙援助杜瓦利埃，前者也是靠美国的支持来维持统治的。去年12月份，他们之间签订了所谓的“反共条约”。当时“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”写道，这个条约是针对所有不满这个独裁政权的人的。
    报纸着重指出，海地的监狱关满了政治犯，拷问已是司空见惯的事情，现在不仅是人民，连军队里也有人对现政权感到非常不满。“纽约时报”记者今天自太子港（海地）报道，多米尼加独裁者的军队在海地政府的同意下占领国境上的战略点马利帕塞，从这里他们很快就能越过边境来帮助海地当局镇压人民。
    在巴拉圭，据透露，鉴于巴拉圭人民强烈反对独裁政权，美国正在酝酿一项旨在保存独裁政权的政治阴谋。美国“视界”杂志不久前报道说，外国驻巴拉圭大使馆的一些人员对巴拉圭局势的发展进行了预测，他们认为巴拉圭目前的独裁者斯特罗斯纳很有可能推出他党内的另一个人做“总统”。这个“新总统”的人选是巴拉圭中央银行行长古斯塔夫·斯托尔姆。这家杂志说，斯托尔姆打算到美国去一趟。
