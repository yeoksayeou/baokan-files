Springtime Fullness in Changshu
By our reporters Jin Feng and Gu Ping

A New Starting Point

Looking out, ridge after ridge of wheat seedlings are like strips of green velvet carpets, spreading out and covering the earth. A gentle breeze blows, stirring up layers of waves, joyfully dancing in the spring fields. On the narrow field ridges walked the Party Secretaries of the forty-one communes of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, attending an on-site meeting at Tangqiao Commune, the county's triple-wheat champion township of the previous year. Standing at the edge of a field with a wooden sign marking a "Ten-Thousand-Jin Experimental Plot," County Party Secretary Liu Lirong said meaningfully to Tangqiao Commune Party Secretary Yuan Peichun, "Right, Lao Yuan, this plot is yours, isn't it?" Comrade Yuan Peichun nodded knowingly. At this moment, many commune Party Secretaries, including Secretary Liu, came forward. With hearty laughter, Comrade Liu Lirong said happily to everyone, "This is the plot. Last year at this time, Provincial Party Secretary Liu brought all the provincial county Party Secretaries to see it. The idea of 'triple-wheat surpassing rice' was proposed based on this plot." At that time, this plot was an experimental field of a senior agricultural cooperative in Tangqiao, with approximately three to four hundred thousand wheat seedlings, ranking among the best in the county. But this year, if lined up, it would only be considered a third-class crop. "Let's count the number of seedlings in this field!" Comrade Liu Lirong said as he gently stepped into the wheat field, pulled out a ruler to measure a square foot of wheat seedlings, and squatted down to count. An abacus clicked and clacked nearby, "One million five hundred and sixty thousand seedlings," the person calculating reported loudly. Then the Party Secretaries walked through brigade after brigade of Tangqiao Commune, scrutinizing field after field of wheat with shrewd and experienced eyes, constantly squatting down to check the seedlings and calculate the accounts. The results of the seedling count were: first-class seedlings had one million to one million five hundred thousand seedlings, second-class seedlings had five hundred thousand to one million seedlings, and third-class seedlings also had around five hundred thousand seedlings.

The wheat seedlings of Tangqiao Commune, like a mirror, reflected the lush growth of the triple-wheat crops in Changshu County. The vibrant green wheat seedlings brought the Party Secretaries to a state of high spirits and excitement.

Faced with such a beautiful scene, could they be satisfied with just a general harvest? The CCP Changshu County Committee, skilled at leading the masses to continuously advance, immediately put forward a new goal, "Work hard for one hundred days, harvest double-thousand jin of triple-wheat; One harvest is equivalent to a whole year, the key lies in the present!"

Vow to Seize Double-Thousand Jin

The County Party Committee's call ignited the entire county like a raging fire in the spring breeze. On this hundred-li expanse of fields south of the Yangtze River, red flags fluttered, songs echoed, and tens of thousands of people were applying fertilizer to the reviving crops, vowing to seize double-thousand jin. In Guli, Xinzhuang, and Mocheng, hundreds of large and small boats set sail for Shanghai to load yellow manure and garbage. Fifty-two-year-old Lao Huang Song took five young men and sailed to a small island in the middle of the river early in the morning to cut grass. In order not to waste any time, they cooked their meals on the way back and forth. Lao Huang Song is truly a down-to-earth farmer who works diligently. How many such commune members are there? Certainly tens of millions!

Freed from the burdens of life, engaging in production is gradually becoming a joy in people's lives. In a wheat field in front of Taojiaqiao in Tangqiao Commune, five shock teams formed ranks and launched a competition, with three different colored flags planted in front of their positions. The competition had already entered its fourth day. See, the women have taken off their cotton jackets, revealing red woolen sweaters, which are particularly eye-catching in the green fields. Carrying loads of manure in baskets, they sing folk songs and walk swiftly on the field ridges. Today, they are determined to exceed the accumulated fertilizer quota by one and a half times and outdo the young men. The young men have all changed to larger baskets today, smiling and calmly accepting the challenge. The red flag has stayed with them for a day; how can they let the women snatch it away! In one morning, the women are about to complete their daily quota, and the young men are clearly falling behind. "Work harder!" the young men shouted, chasing after them. The women's laughter grew louder and louder!

Ten Sisters Pioneer Team

Lu Ermei, captain of the Communist Construction Ten Sisters Pioneer Team of Mocheng People's Commune, hummed a folk song softly, carrying a full bucket of "mixed soup" made of pigsty ash, yellow manure, cow manure, and fertilizer powder straight to their ten-mu ten-thousand-jin experimental field. Zhou Qiaoying and Zhang Xiuying, who were watering fertilizer in the field ditches, laughed and called out, "Listen, Ermei is singing a folk song!" Lu Ermei smiled and said, "Let's all sing together!" Last November, ten young and lively women carried iron hoes weighing five or six jin and turned the soil one hoe at a time. The ten mu of hard land was turned one and a half feet deep after three days of hard work. Five hundred dan of base fertilizer were applied per mu, and carefully selected wheat seeds were sown in the ground. Then they dug drainage ditches around the wheat field and in the middle of the ridges. They created indigenous fertilizer, digging stove ash and thousand-foot mud, and carrying yellow manure from the town. They sifted the garbage transported back from Shanghai, scattering it handful by handful in the fields. In winter, they ground a layer of soil fertilizer finely and spread it on the wheat seedlings, covering them like a velvet blanket. When it rained, they wore raincoats and hats and rushed to the fields to repair ditches and drain water. Now, these ten mu of wheat seedlings are a lush green, seven or eight inches tall, with strong roots and broad leaves, with approximately two million seedlings or more per mu. To prevent the wheat plants from lodging, they will take various corresponding measures. This is truly a group of pioneers in building socialism!

A New Type of "Laboratory"

Changshu people are striving for a bumper harvest of triple-wheat not only with soaring enthusiasm, but also by learning scientific management methods. Some new types of "laboratories" have appeared in the wheat fields of each commune. Adjacent to the Yangtze River, the dense wheat seedlings of Dongshazhou Commune are better than each other. People who enter Minle Embankment feel like they have entered a large garden. On two semicircular light yellow sandy soil plots in the fields, emerald green wheat seedlings embroider five-pointed stars, and also embroider the words "Minle Experimental Embankment Welcomes Visitors." Straight wheat ridges shoot out from the semicircular drawing board like the rays of the sun, radiating towards the distance. Each mound of this two-hundred-plus mu experimental field is marked with a small wooden sign, numbered, and marked with different plowing depths, different seeding rates, and the name of the manager. Every one or two rows, you can see four small bamboo strips inserted into a square among the wheat seedlings. These are "representative squares" for periodic inspection records. An inspection is made in this square foot every ten days or every week.

The "advisors" of the experimental embankment, Cheng Shude and Hou Guozhu, are conducting inspection and recording work in the fields. Cheng Shude is a technician from the County Agricultural Science Department stationed at this experimental embankment, and Hou Guozhu is an old farmer around forty years old. They use a square-foot frame made of lead wire, place it in the place marked with bamboo strips, carefully count the number of seedlings, measure the height of the wheat seedlings and the width of the wheat leaves, observe the tillering of the wheat seedlings and the changes in the color of the seedlings, and fill these details in a table. Changes in natural conditions and the labor input of each field number are also recorded. The commune Party secretary also often observes the growth of wheat seedlings with the "advisors" to study and determine the next steps for wheat field management.

Cheng Shude and Hou Guozhu have been working together since the deep plowing and sowing of this experimental embankment. They respect each other and learn from each other. In the past, the field observation and recording work was done by Cheng Shude alone, but now Hou Guozhu can also master it skillfully. This hardworking and simple old farmer, known for his meticulous farming before cooperation, only produced 120 jin per mu in his fifteen mu of wheat fields in the best year. After cooperation, yields have increased year by year, but he never thought that the steps would be so fast. This year, he aims to harvest double-thousand jin per mu!

In the middle and around the experimental embankment, there are also several groundwater level measuring devices installed, and water level scales are inserted in the surrounding rivers. Lowering the groundwater level is an important key for the alluvial plain of the Yangtze River in the sandbar area to strive for high yields of triple-wheat. A few days ago, there were several consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather. Although deep ditches were opened, the requirement of "no water after rain" was achieved, but due to the high groundwater level, there was still one or two points of water left in the ditches. What to do? Everyone said, if there is water in the ditch, we will wipe it dry with clothes, and some said we will drink it dry. As a result, they wiped the water in the ditches dry with handfuls of accumulated grass. Now that they have homemade groundwater level measuring devices, they can actively control the groundwater.

The surrounding farmers are all watching this experimental embankment. When the experimental embankment top-dresses, the surrounding embankments also follow the top-dressing; when the experimental embankment opens ditches, the surrounding embankments are also busy opening ditches. They said that the experimental embankment takes one step, and we will follow one step, not letting go, and following closely, just like a hundred birds facing the phoenix. Now every embankment here has become an experimental embankment, everyone is striving to be the wheat king, and the wheat is growing particularly luxuriantly!

The Old Farmer's Concerns

In the northeast of Minle Embankment, strips of embankment ridges extend towards the Yangtze River. Standing on the high embankment ridge, looking out, thousands of mu of green wheat fields stretch out from under your feet to the distance. The wide embankment slopes are also covered with rows of sturdy wheat seedlings, and the rolling Yangtze River flows docilely to the east outside the high embankment.

Walking towards the heart of the embankment from the open central road, the crowds applying fertilizer are slowly moving in the green ocean like many small black dots. After the women's captain Shi Xiuzhen finished the meeting in the commune, she hurried home and joined everyone in the field to rush to apply fertilizer. The twenty-one households on this embankment all voluntarily moved from four townships in the west. This is the first time they have grown wheat here this year, and people are full of joy and want to start well and have a good year.

In the canteen, old farmer Zhang Caifang, whose hair is already gray, solemnly asked the captain to send a message to the county magistrate to quickly send people here to build wheat fields and warehouses. He said: What I worry about day and night now is where to put the grain when it is harvested. There are more than 4,000 mu of wheat fields here. Looking at this mu, we will really harvest more than a thousand jin! (Attached picture)
*"Strive for a thousand-jin county of wheat" is a common slogan of the communes in Guanghua County, Hubei Province. Under the more meticulous management than in previous years, the county's wheat is growing vigorously. The third weeding has now been generally completed, and fertilizer has been applied twice. A mass upsurge in wheat field management is continuing throughout the county. This is a photo of members of the Bailian Commune carefully weeding in the wheat fields.*

    春满常熟
    本报记者　金凤　古平
    新的起点
    一眼望过去，一垅垅麦苗就像一条条绿色的绒毯，舒展开去，铺满大地。微风吹过，掀起层层的波浪，在春天的原野上欢乐地跳动着。窄窄的田埂上，走着江苏常熟县四十一个公社的党委书记，他们是到去年常熟的三麦冠军乡——塘桥公社来开现场会议的。在一块插着万斤试验片的木牌的田头，县委书记刘立荣同志意味深长地招呼着塘桥公社的党委书记袁培春同志说：“对不对，老袁，这块田是你的吧？”袁培春同志会心地点点头。这时候，许多公社的党委刘书记都走上前来了。刘立荣同志带着爽朗的笑声，高高兴兴地对大伙说：“就是这块田，去年这时候，省委刘书记带着全省的县委书记都来看了。”“三麦赶水稻”就是根据这块田提出来的。那时候，这块田是塘桥一个高级社的一块试验田，麦苗大约有三、四十万株，在全县是数一数二的。可是今年要排起队来，只能算是三类苗了。“让我们来数数这块田里的苗数吧！”刘立荣同志说着便轻轻走进麦田，拔出尺来量了一平方尺的麦苗，就蹲着数起来了。算盘在一旁滴滴搭搭地拨弄着，“一百五十六万株”。打算盘的人高声报告着。接着党委书记们走过塘桥公社的一个大队又一个大队，带着精明老练的眼光，打量着一片又一片的麦田，他们不住地蹲下身来查苗算账。查苗的结果是：一类苗有一百万到一百五十万苗，二类苗有五十万到一百万苗，三类苗也在五十万苗左右。
    塘桥公社的麦苗，像一面镜子似地反映出常熟县三麦生长丰茂的情景。绿油油的麦苗把党委书记们的心带到了高昂兴奋的境地。
    在这样美好的图画面前，难道能够满足于一般的丰收？善于带领群众不断前进的中共常熟县委，立即提出了新的奋斗目标，“大干一百天，三麦收双千；一熟顶一年，关键在当前！”
    誓夺双千斤
    县委的这一号召，像烈火春风般地在全县燃烧起来。长江南岸这一片方圆百里的原野上，红旗招展，歌声不断，有几十万人追施返青肥，誓夺双千斤。在古里、辛庄和莫城，几百条大船和小船开向上海装运黄粪和垃圾去了。五十二岁的老黄嵩带着五个年轻人，一清早开船到江心小岛割草，为了不耽误一点时间，他们在来回的路上升火做饭。老黄嵩，真是一个踏踏实实埋头苦干的庄稼汉，像这样的社员，何止上千万？
    摆脱了生活的负担，搞生产逐渐成为人们生活的乐趣。在塘桥公社的陶家桥前面一片麦田里，五个突击队摆成阵势展开了竞赛，三种颜色的旗帜插在阵前。竞赛已经进入第四天了。你看，妇女们脱下棉袄，露出一身红毛线衣，在绿色的田野上分外夺目。她们挑起一担担圈肥，唱着山歌，在田埂上快步如飞。今天她们决心要突破积肥定额的一倍半，把小伙子们比下去。小伙子们今天都换了大筐，笑嘻嘻地沉着应战，红旗在他们手中已经留了一天，怎么能给妇女们抢去！一个上午，妇女们快完成一天的定额，小伙子们显然落后了。“加油干哪！”小伙子们欢叫着，追赶着。妇女们的笑声也愈来愈响亮了！
    十姊妹闯将队
    莫城人民公社共产主义建设十姊妹闯将队的队长陆二妹，轻轻哼着山歌，挑着一满桶用猪窝灰、黄粪、牛粪、肥田粉拌成的“什锦汤”，直往她们的十亩万斤试验田走去。在田沟浇粪的周巧英和张秀英笑着叫：“听呀，二妹唱山歌！”陆二妹笑着说：“大家一起来唱！”去年11月，十位年轻快活的妇女扛起五六斤重的铁搭，一搭搭翻着。十亩硬实的土地，经过三天苦战，翻了一尺半深，每亩施基肥五百担，把精选的麦种撒在地里，接着就在麦田周围开转沟，麦垅中间开中沟。她们造土化肥，挖灶土泥和千脚泥，到镇上挑黄粪，把上海运回的垃圾用筛子筛细，一把把撒在田里。冬天，她们将一层土肥磨细，铺撒在麦苗上，像一床绒被似地复盖麦苗。下雨了，她们穿蓑衣，戴笠帽，赶到田里修沟排水。现在这十亩麦苗一片葱绿，苗高七八寸，苗根粗壮，苗叶开阔，每亩大约二百万苗以上。为了防止麦株倒伏，她们将采取各种相应的措施。这真是一群建设社会主义的闯将呵！
    新型的“实验室”
    常熟人民争取三麦大丰收，不仅有冲天的干劲，而且学习了科学的管理方法。每个公社的麦田里都出现了一些新型的“实验室”。紧临长江的东沙洲公社，茂密的麦苗一块胜过一块。人们走进民乐圩，就像走进了一座大花园，在田头两块半圆形的浅黄色的沙土上，碧绿的麦苗绣出一颗颗五角星，还绣出“民乐试验圩欢迎参观”的字样，一道道笔直的麦垅，像太阳的光芒似的从半圆形的画案四周射向远方。这一片二百多亩试验田，每丘都插有小木牌，上面编了号码，写着不同的耕翻深度，不同的播种量……，以及管理人的姓名。每隔一、两壤，就看到麦苗中有四根小竹片插成一个正方形，这是定期做检查记录的“代表方”，每隔十天或一星期就在这一平方尺内作一次检查。
    试验圩的“参谋”程树德和侯国柱，正在田间做检查记录工作。程树德是县农业科派驻这个试验圩的技术员，侯国柱是位四十岁左右的老农。他们用一个铅丝做的一平方尺的框框，放在竹片标明的地方，仔细地点数苗数，测量麦苗的高度和麦叶的宽度，观察麦苗的分蘖情况和苗色的变化，并把这些情况一一填在表格中。自然条件的变化和每一号田的用工情况，也都记录下来。公社党委书记也经常和“参谋”在一起观察麦苗的生长情况，以便研究确定下一步麦田管理的措施。
    从这个试验圩深翻播种开始，程树德和侯国柱就在一起合作了，他们互相尊重，互相学习。过去，田间观测记录工作只有程树德一个人做，现在侯国柱也能熟练地掌握了。这位勤劳朴实、以种田精细闻名的老农，在合作化以前，他家种的十五亩麦田，最好的年成才亩产一百二十斤。合作化以后，产量年年提高，但是他从来也没有想到步子会跨得这么快，今年要争取每亩收获双千斤！
    在试验圩的中间和四周，还装有几根地下水位测量器，周围的小河里插着测水标尺。降低地下水位，是沙洲地区这块长江冲积平原争取三麦高产的重要关键。前些时接连阴雨好几天，虽然开了深沟，雨住田干的要求是达到了，但由于地下水位高，沟里还留有一、二分水。怎么办呢？大家说，沟里有水，我们用衣服擦也要把它擦干，有的说喝也要把它喝干。结果他们用积草一把把揩干了沟里的水。现在他们有了土制的地下水位测量器，就能主动地制服地下水了。
    周围的农民眼睛都看着这片试验圩。试验圩追肥，周围的几个圩也跟着追肥；试验圩开沟，周围的几个圩也忙着开沟。他们说，试验圩走一步，我们就跟一步，一步不让，紧紧跟上，就像百鸟朝凤一样。现在这里圩圩都成了试验圩，个个争做小麦王，麦子都长得特别茂盛！
    老农的心事
    在民乐圩东北，一条条圩埂伸向长江边，站在高高的圩埂上，极目四眺，数千亩绿油油的麦田从脚下伸向远方，宽宽的圩坡上也都长满一行行茁壮的麦苗，滚滚江涛在高大的圩埂外面温驯地向东流去。
    从开阔的中心马路向圩心走去，追肥的人群像许多小黑点在绿色的海洋中慢慢地移动着。女队长施秀珍在公社开会结束后，连忙赶到家里，同大家一起下田突击追肥。这个圩的二十一户人家，都是从西边四个乡自愿迁来的，这里今年第一次种麦，人们满心欢欣地要来个抬头见喜。
    在食堂里，头发已经花白的老农张才方，郑重地要队长带个口信给县长，赶紧派人到这里来做麦场，盖仓库。他说：现在日夜担心的是，粮食收到手往哪里放。这一片麦田有四千多亩，看这一亩，真要收千多斤啦！（附图片）
    “力争小麦千斤县”是湖北省光化县各公社一个共同的战斗口号。全县小麦在比往年更细致的管理下，生长旺盛，现在普遍锄完三遍草，追了两次肥。群众性的麦田管理高潮正在全县继续展开。这是白莲公社社员们在麦田里细心除草。　新华社记者　华军、心宁摄
