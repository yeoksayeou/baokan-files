(Dispatch from our newspaper) Reports recently published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regarding world crude steel production in 1958, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East concerning economic surveys in Asia and the Far East, and figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce acknowledge that socialist countries experienced significant economic development last year, while Western countries suffered severe "recession."

The first quarterly issue of "Steel Production Statistics," recently published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, indicates that world crude steel production in 1958 was approximately 270 million tons, a decrease of 23 million tons compared to 1957 and 14 million tons compared to 1956, returning to the production level of 1955. Almost all major capitalist steel-producing countries were affected by the "recession." It specifically mentions the continuous decline in U.S. crude steel production in recent years: U.S. crude steel production fell from 106 million tons in 1955 to 105 million tons in 1956, and further to 102 million tons in 1957. Last year, it plummeted to 77 million tons, a decrease of 25% compared to 1957.

In addition to the United States, steel production in most Western European countries also declined significantly in 1958. Steel production in the six "Coal and Steel Community" countries fell from 59.8 million tons in 1957 to 57.7 million tons, a decrease of 4%. The UK's steel production in 1958 was 20 million tons, a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year.

When discussing steel production in socialist countries, the publication acknowledged that socialist countries "have fundamentally different trends." In 1958, Soviet steel production increased from 51 million tons to 55 million tons, while the People's Republic of China "has reached over 11 million tons, becoming the world's seventh-largest steel producer."

The survey report recently submitted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East headquarters in Bangkok to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East conference held in Broadbeach, Australia, also illustrates the same situation.

When discussing the overall unfavorable production situation in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East region, excluding the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic, the survey report points out that "the development of agricultural and industrial production (in the aforementioned regions) experienced a temporary cessation in the second half of 1957 and most of 1958." The survey report states that "due to the decline in agricultural production in Burma, India, Pakistan, and Thailand," "grain production in the region decreased by 6% in 1958." Japan's industry "contracted" after mid-1957, and in 1958 it was "unstable."

Although the survey report repeatedly claimed that it "expressed reservations" about certain data related to China's economic development, it still stated: "In contrast to the situation in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East region, the economy of mainland China appears to have begun to flourish in 1958." "The production of cotton textiles and coal seems to have exceeded that of the United Kingdom," and "the total value of agricultural and industrial production increased by approximately 75% last year."

At the end of February, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in publishing a comparison of world steel production, also had to admit that in 1958, with the exception of France (which increased by 500,000 tons), steel production in all major capitalist steel-producing countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the entire "Coal and Steel Community" group, and Japan decreased. During the same period, the Soviet Union increased by 4 million tons, while China increased by 120%. (Attached picture)

### 联合国两个经济委员会和美国商务部发表的报告承认  社会主义国家欣欣向荣西方国家一蹶不振  美英两国钢产量分别下跌百分之二十五和百分之十

    联合国两个经济委员会和美国商务部发表的报告承认
    社会主义国家欣欣向荣西方国家一蹶不振
    美英两国钢产量分别下跌百分之二十五和百分之十
    本报讯　联合国欧洲经济委员会最近发表的关于1958年世界粗钢产量的统计、联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会关于亚洲及远东地区的经济调查报告以及美国商务部发表的数字，承认去年社会主义国家经济有很大发展，而西方国家经济则发生严重的“衰退”。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会最近出版的第一期季刊“钢产量统计”指出，1958年全世界粗钢产量约为二亿七千万吨，比1957年少了二千三百万吨，比1956年少一千四百万吨，已退回到1955年的生产水平。几乎所有资本主义主要产钢国都受到“衰退”的影响。它特别提到美国粗钢产量近年以来逐年下降的情况：美国粗钢产量从1955年的一亿零六百万吨下降到1956年的一亿零五百万吨，再下降到1957年的一亿零二百万吨。去年更剧烈降到七千七百万吨，计比1957年下降了25％。
    除美国以外，大多数西欧国家的钢产量在1958年也大大下降。“煤钢联营”六国的钢产量从1957年的五千九百八十万吨下降到五千七百七十万吨，计下降了4％。英国1958年的钢产量是二千万吨，比前一年降低了10％。
    在谈到社会主义阵营国家的钢产量时，这个机关刊物承认：社会主义阵营国家“有着根本不同的倾向”。1958年苏联钢产量从五千一百万吨增加到五千五百万吨，而中华人民共和国则“已达到一千一百万吨以上，成为世界第七大产钢国”。
    联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会曼谷总部最近向在澳大利亚广滩举行的亚洲及远东经济委员会会议提出的调查报告，也说明了同样的情况。
    这份调查报告在谈到不包括中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国在内的亚洲及远东经济委员会地区的整个生产不利形势时指出，“1957年后半年和1958年的大部分时间，（上述地区的）农业和工业产量的发展发生了暂时的停止现象”。调查报告说：“由于缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦和泰国的农产量下降”，因此使“这个地区1958年的谷物产量下降了6％。”日本在1957年年中后工业“就萎缩了”，而在1958年则是“动摇不定”。
    这个调查报告虽然一再声称它对有关中国经济发展的某些资料“表示保留意见”，但仍然说：“与亚洲及远东经济委员会地区的情况形成对照的是，大陆中国的经济在1958年看来已经开始蓬勃发展”。“棉织品的产量和煤产量似乎已经超过英国的产量”，而“农业和工业生产的总值去年大约增加了75％”。
    2月底美国商务部在发表一项关于世界钢产量的对比中也不得不承认：在1958年除掉法国（增加了五十万吨）以外，所有资本主义主要产钢国如美国、加拿大、英国、整个“煤钢联营”集团国家和日本的钢产量都减少了。而在同时期内苏联却增加了四百万吨，中国则增加了120％。（附图片）
