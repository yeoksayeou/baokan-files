Ulan Bator dispatch from our newspaper, March 4th: The "Dzhamtyn" Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative in Mongolia's Central Province accepted over two hundred new members into the cooperative on the evening of March 1st. The two townships where this cooperative is located have completely achieved agricultural and pastoral collectivization.

The "Dzhamtyn" Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative now has a total of one thousand seven hundred and five members and more than one thousand eight hundred head of livestock. Cooperative Director Chogijrzhab said that in 1958, the cooperative's livestock had a net increase of seven hundred head, the output of livestock products was further increased, and the cooperative's net income reached more than 360,000 Tugriks (Mongolian currency). Therefore, the remuneration for cooperative members' workdays has increased, with each workday receiving 4.2 Tugriks in cash and 250 grams of meat. The living standards of cooperative members have further improved. The superiority of the cooperative has attracted the surrounding herders, and in just a few months, complete collectivization of the two townships has been achieved.

According to the cooperative director, the cooperative's development plan for 1959 includes a net increase of more than 2,000 head of livestock, an increase in the area of agricultural cultivation from 200 hectares to 800 hectares, and the development of various sideline productions such as brick burning and timber transportation. The cooperative's settlement will build medical clinics and other buildings this year.

The "Dzhamtyn" Cooperative is one of the hundreds of cooperatives in Mongolia. The Mongolian farmers who have been organized, like the members of this cooperative, are actively working to welcome this year's bumper agricultural and pastoral harvest.

    蒙古“扎木图”农牧社
    一天接受两百户新社员
    本报乌兰巴托4日电　蒙古中央省“扎木图”农牧业合作社1日晚上接纳了两百多户新社员入社。这个社所在的两个乡全部实现了农牧业合作化。
  “扎木图”农牧业合作社现在共有一千七百零五名社员和一千八多百多头牲畜。社长却吉尔札布说，1958年这个社的牲畜纯增殖七百头，畜产品的产量进一步提高，全社纯收入达三十六万多图格里克（蒙币）。因此，社员劳动日的报酬增多了，每个劳动日得到四点二图格里克现金和二百五十克肉，社员生活进一步有了改善。合作社的优越性吸引了周围的牧民，在短短几个月中，就实现了两个乡的全部合作化。
    据这位社长谈，合作社1959年的发展计划，牲畜将纯增两千多头农业耕种面积将从二百公顷增加到八百公顷，并要开展烧砖和运木材等各种副业生产。合作社定居地今年将建设医疗所等建筑物。
    “扎木图”合作社是蒙古几百个合作社中的一个，已经组织起来的蒙古农民，都像这个合作社的社员一样，正在为迎接今年的农牧业丰产而积极劳动。
