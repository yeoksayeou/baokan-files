Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. Jilin Province is starting to plow early and sow spring wheat in frozen soil. Before sowing, various regions widely debated the benefits of sowing seeds in frozen soil and summarized that wheat "sown on ice, harvested in fire (summer)" can resist drought and retain moisture, germinate early, produce strong seedlings, avoid blight, and produce full grains for early ripening and harvesting. Therefore, the sowing of spring wheat in various regions this year is about half a month earlier than last year.

The western and central regions of Jilin Province have flat terrain and fertile land, suitable for growing wheat. Farmers have created many experiences for high-yield wheat production in their production practices, and sowing in frozen soil is one of them. This year, the wheat sowing area in Jilin Province will be about twice that of last year. In order to regulate the tight manpower and animal power during the busy farming season, more than 100,000 mu of wheat has been winter-sown this winter, learning from foreign experience.

Jilin Province's preparations for striving for a bumper wheat harvest this year began as early as the wheat harvest season last year, selecting excellent seed varieties that mature early and are resistant to rust. Most of the spring sowing land was deep-plowed in winter. Since the beginning of spring, various regions have increased the application of high-quality base fertilizer, leveled the land, and dug wells for irrigation. At present, the spring wheat sowing work in various places is being carried out faster and more carefully than in previous years. Many places have established wheat field professional teams to take charge of wheat field management. A competition for wheat yields of 1,000 jin per mu has been launched in various counties in the Baicheng area.

    叫春小麦高产再高产
    吉林提早开犁，顶冻播种
    据新华社长春电　吉林省各地提早开犁，顶冻播种春小麦。播种前各地都广泛辩论了顶冻种麦的好处，总结出小麦“种在冰上，收在火上（夏季）”，可以抗旱保墒，提前发芽，麦苗健壮，躲过疸期，籽粒饱满，早熟早收。因此，各地今年春小麦的播种比去年又提早半月左右。
    吉林省的西部、中部地区，地势平坦，土地肥沃，适于种小麦。农民们在生产实践中创造了许多小麦高额丰产的经验，顶冻播种就是其中之一。吉林省今年小麦播种面积要比去年增加一倍左右，为了调节农忙时期人力、畜力紧张状况，有十万多亩小麦已在冬天学习外地经验试行冬播。
    吉林省争取今年小麦丰收的准备工作早在去年麦收季节就已开始，选择了成熟早、抗锈力强的优良籽种。冬天大部分春播地都进行了深翻。入春以来，各地又增施优质底肥，平整土地，打井灌田。目前，各地春小麦播种工作比往年进行得又快又细致。不少地方建立了麦田专业队，分工负责麦田管理。亩产千斤小麦的竞赛运动，已经在白城地区各县展开。
