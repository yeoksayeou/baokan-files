Xinhua News Agency, March 24th—The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China issued a notice on the 24th to the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region committees of the Communist Youth League, requiring all young workers to use outstanding work achievements to welcome the convening of the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in socialist construction in the fields of industry, transportation, basic construction, and finance and trade.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League requires Youth League committees at all levels, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, to immediately conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization among all young workers. Based on the specific conditions of each province, city, and factory, propose specific struggle goals and action slogans for young people, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of young people, actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, engage in technological revolution in a big way, and greatly improve labor productivity, so as to welcome the convening of the representative conference with outstanding achievements in over fulfilling the magnificent plan for 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, March 24th—The broad masses of workers in the capital enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, determined to launch an even greater leap forward, create outstanding achievements, and welcome the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction.

The iron smelting plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Beijing Switch Factory held skill competitions today. The young blast furnace workers of the iron smelting plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company are determined to further improve the originally planned utilization coefficient index. The average wind temperature of the hot blast stove is now 1,040 degrees, and the workers said that they will reach 1,080 degrees before the fourth quarter. The workers of this factory said: We must create outstanding achievements to welcome the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers.

More than 20,000 workers of the Beijing Transportation Company, who are carrying out the "Daily Red, Monthly Red, Everyone Red, Field Red" competition, today put forward new guarantees by field and by fleet, determined to complete the annual transportation volume of 29,370,000 tons and save 5,889 tons of gasoline and diesel, to win the red flag in the national transportation industry.

Ding Qingyun, the leader of the concrete youth shock team and an advanced producer in the national construction industry, said that from now on, we must engage in technological revolution in a big way, adjust the organization of labor, and ensure that labor productivity doubles again on the current basis. This team originally had 50 people, including supporting trades, but today 20 people were reduced, but the completed concrete pouring task exceeded what 50 people had completed by 30%.

Many red flag units in the financial and trade system said that they would hold the red flag even higher. Xu Guixiang, an advanced worker in the Tianqiao Department Store, said: Seeing the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I have even more energy. She said that she would further improve service attitude and merchandise display, add variety, reduce errors, and help two comrades in the group reach the level of advanced salespersons in the third quarter. Zhang Binggui, a model worker in Beijing at the Wangfujing Department Store, conducted deliberations with 47 red flag bearers in the store and prepared to put forward a proposal to all employees to launch an even greater leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 24th—The broad masses of workers on the industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade fronts in Tianjin are determined to respond to the call of the Party and the government with soaring enthusiasm, achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and strive to go to Beijing to participate in the heroes' conference.

This morning as soon as work started, many factory workers gathered to discuss, revise planned targets, and put forward many measures to ensure the realization of the leap forward. The workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant, who are fighting for 18 million tons of steel, said that they would produce more and better steel ingots and steel materials for the country with the greatest enthusiasm and strive to go to Beijing. The Qi Zisheng team of this factory, a model team in Tianjin in 1958, proposed in the discussion: the smelting time in April should be shortened by more than one hour compared with March, and the qualified rate of steel ingots should be guaranteed to reach 100%. The workers of the steel wire rope factory, who overfulfilled the first quarter production task eight days ahead of schedule, proposed to increase the production of steel wire rope by 80 tons for the country before the end of the month. The Liu Chaofan team of the C class of the three-ton electric furnace of the Emerging Steel Plant, guaranteed to welcome the convening of the conference with practical actions to complete 125% of the plan every day.

The workers of the carpentry team of the fifth engineering area of the Tianjin First Construction Company, said that they would continue to make a big noise in the technological revolution, put down backward tools before the "May Day" and realize the mechanization and continuity of carpentry, so that labor efficiency will increase by 98% compared with 1958.

The workers of the Guangfu Road Non-staple Food Store in Heping District, a model unit in Tianjin in 1958, all expressed their determination to continue to vigorously carry out the red flag competition movement, further improve operation and management, improve work efficiency, and better serve customers.
