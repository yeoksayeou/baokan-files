Dunhuang, Gansu Determined to Seize the High-Yield Red Flag Again

    (Our report) Dunhuang County, Gansu, which achieved a double leap forward in wheat and cotton last year, is determined to seize the red flag of large-scale, high-yield wheat and cotton production again this year with the high-spirited fighting spirit of "working hard and skillfully for 300 days, striving to double grain and cotton production." At present, various places have started sowing spring wheat six days earlier than last year.

    Dunhuang County, known as the "Oasis of the Gobi Desert," is a red flag county in Gansu for its double bumper harvest of spring wheat and cotton last year. The yield of spring wheat increased from an average of 408 jin per mu in 1957 to more than 1,000 jin, and cotton also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Based on this foundation, they recently proposed the following targets for increasing grain and cotton production: this year, more than 70,000 mu of spring wheat will be sown, with an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu, an increase of more than 900 jin compared with 1958. The total output will reach 200 million jin. 110,000 mu of cotton will be sown, with an average yield of 500 jin of ginned cotton per mu, more than double the increase compared to last year. The total output of ginned cotton will reach 55 million jin. Based on a population of 100,000 in the county, after one year, the average person will have 2,000 jin of grain and 550 jin of ginned cotton, with an average income of 875 yuan per person, an increase of more than double compared to 1958.

    In order to achieve the above targets, Dunhuang County mainly focuses on the following aspects:

    1. Give prominence to politics. Continue to emancipate the mind, break superstitions, and constantly fight against all kinds of right-leaning thoughts. Work hard, earnestly, practically, and skillfully, combine the masses' soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of scientific analysis, implement the "Ten Proposals," and ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    2. Conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Launch a mass movement to accumulate, produce, and deliver fertilizer, so that the amount of fertilizer applied per mu will be increased from 22,000 jin in 1958 to 100,000 jin. On the basis of universally deep plowing all land, eliminate saline-alkali land and uneven land, and improve the soil; vigorously carry out water conservancy construction and irrigation technology revolution, and implement planned water use; select fine varieties, rationally plant densely, protect seedlings and bolls, and eliminate missing seedlings and broken ridges. Ensure 800,000 to 1 million wheat seedlings and 9,000 cotton plants per mu, with each plant bearing 30 bolls; deepen the technical revolution, vigorously carry out tool reform, continue to set off a larger-scale tool reform upsurge, and realize semi-mechanization of flour milling and the use of new agricultural tools for sowing, cultivation, harvesting, and threshing.

    3. Vigorously carry out the high-yield demonstration field movement, planting 42,000 mu of high-yield grain and cotton fields throughout the county. 20,000 mu for grain, with a yield of 4,000-5,000 jin per mu; 22,000 mu for cotton, with a yield of 1,000-1,600 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Closely combine the high-yield demonstration field movement with cadres and the masses engaging in experimental fields. Cadres all plant experimental fields, and mobilize all kinds of model figures and production experts to engage in experimental fields and establish banners.

    4. Further change the style of leadership and continue to promote the working method of the mass line of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, and visiting and comparing.

    In order to realize the above plan, the people of the county are currently launching a mass upsurge of preparatory plowing with greater enthusiasm, and are actively carrying out preparations for sowing spring wheat and cotton.

    甘肃敦煌决心再夺高产红旗
    本报讯　去年麦棉双跃进的敦煌县，誓以“大干巧干三百天，力争粮棉加一番”的高昂斗志，再夺今年麦棉大面积高额丰产的红旗。目前各地已比去年提早六天开始播种春小麦。
    号称“戈壁的绿洲”的敦煌县，是甘肃去年的春小麦和棉花双丰收的红旗县。春小麦产量由1957年的平均亩产四百零八斤上升为一千多斤，棉花也取得了空前的大丰收。在这个基础上，他们最近提出的粮棉增产指标是：今年播种春小麦七万多亩，平均亩产达到二千斤，比1958年增加九百多斤。总产达到二亿斤。棉花播种十一万亩，平均亩产皮棉五百斤，比去年增产一倍多。总产皮棉达五千五百万斤。全县按十万人口计算，一年后达到平均每人有粮食二千斤，皮棉五百五十斤，平均每人收入达到八百七十五元，比1958年增长一倍以上。
    为了实现上述指标，敦煌县主要抓住以下几个方面：
    一、政治挂帅。继续解放思想，破除迷信，不断地和形形色色的右倾思想作斗争。大干苦干实干巧干，把群众的冲天干劲和科学分析精神结合起来，贯彻“十大倡议”，保证今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    二、认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”。全民大搞积肥造肥送肥运动，使每亩地施肥量由1958年的二万二千斤提高到十万斤。在全部土地普遍深翻的基础上，消灭盐碱地和凸凹地，改良土壤；大搞水利建设，大搞灌溉技术上的革命，实行计划用水；选用良种，合理密植，保苗保桃，消灭无苗断垄。小麦保苗八十万株到一百万株，棉花每亩九千株，每株结铃三十个；深入开展技术革命，大搞工具改革，继续掀起一个更大规模的工具改革高潮，实现磨面半机械化，播种、中耕、收割、打碾新式农具化。
    三、大搞高额丰产田运动，全县种粮棉高额丰产田四万二千亩。粮食二万亩，亩产四千——五千斤；棉花二万二千亩，亩产皮棉一千——一千六百斤。将高额丰产田运动与干部群众大搞试验田紧密结合起来。干部都种试验田，发动各类模范人物、生产能手大搞试验田，树立旗帜。
    四、进一步改变领导作风，继续发扬抓两头带中间、参观评比的群众路线的工作方法。
    为了实现上述计划，目前全县人民正以更大的干劲，掀起了一个群众性的备耕高潮，积极进行春小麦播种和棉花播种的准备工作。
