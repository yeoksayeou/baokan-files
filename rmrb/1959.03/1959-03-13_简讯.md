    Brief News
    Iron Plate as Saw Blade
    Liu Qingsheng, Yang Mingqi, and others from the tooling section of the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory successfully used iron plates to replace steel plates in making saw blades. Usage has proven that these saw blades made from iron plates have less wind resistance, don't wobble, and cut faster than steel saw blades. Each iron plate saw blade can save more than 50 yuan, saving the country more than 3,000 yuan a year.
    Rice Husk Plastic Board
    Zhao Baolun, a young carpenter at the Tianjin Xinhe Shipyard, recently successfully trial-produced a brightly colored and glossy plastic board using rice husks, sawdust, and a small amount of "petroleum sulfonic acid" and "phenolic resin" and other chemical substances. Scientific appraisal has shown that this plastic board has very good bending strength, strong waterproof performance, and acid and alkali resistance, and can replace 70% of the wood inside the ship cabin. It also has strong insulation and can be used as a general distribution board.
    Alcohol Replaces Banana Oil
    Workers in the second workshop of the Nanjing Bulb Factory successfully used alcohol to replace banana oil as a fluorescent powder coating solution.
    In the past, the fluorescent powder used for coating fluorescent lamps in this factory was always mixed and dissolved with banana oil. This solvent partially relied on imports.
    Using alcohol to replace banana oil as a coating solution not only solved the supply problem of banana oil, but also saved the country a batch of foreign exchange, and also reduced the cost of solvents, ensuring the production of fluorescent lamps.

    铁板作锯条
    秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂装造工段刘庆升、杨鸣岐等，试用铁板代替钢板做锯条成功。经过使用证明，这种锯条比钢板锯条风力小、不摇摆、锯得快。用这种铁板锯条每个可节约五十多元，一年就能为国家节约三千多元。
    稻皮塑料板
    天津新河船厂青年木工赵宝伦最近用稻皮、锯末加上少许“石油磺酸”和“酚醛树脂”等化学药品，试制成功一种颜色鲜艳，带有光泽的塑料板。经过科学鉴定，这种塑料板抗弯强度很好，防水性能、耐酸耐碱性也很强，可以代替船舱内部70％的木料。它的绝缘性也强，可以做一般的配电板。
    酒精代替香焦水
    南京灯泡厂二车间职工试用酒精代替香焦水作荧光粉涂液成功。
    这个厂过去涂荧光灯用的荧光粉，一直是使用香焦水调和溶解的。这种溶剂部分依靠进口。
    酒精代替香焦水作涂液，不但解决了香焦水的供应问题，而且为国家节省了一批外汇，同时也降低了溶剂成本，保证了荧光灯的生产。
