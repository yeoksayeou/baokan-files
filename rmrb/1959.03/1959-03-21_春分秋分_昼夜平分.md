    Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox: Day and Night Equally Divided
    Qin Xiao
    The Spring Equinox is a major solar term in the twenty-four solar terms. As early as the Spring and Autumn period, more than two thousand years ago, due to the needs of agriculture, China had already used the method of measuring the length of the sun's shadow with a sundial to determine the four major solar terms: Spring Equinox, Autumn Equinox, Winter Solstice, and Summer Solstice. Other solar terms were gradually completed around the Qin Dynasty. The so-called sundial is a jade instrument for measuring the sun's shadow. A pole is erected in the middle, and the different lengths of the pole's shadow cast by the sun at noon each day are used to determine which day a certain solar term arrives. At the same time, it is closely combined with observing the stars at night to see which constellation is overhead in the southern sky at midnight every day, so you can know which constellation the sun is currently in; the ancients divided the solar terms according to the constellation the sun enters each month. Now, on the Spring Equinox, the sun happens to enter the Pisces constellation, or the Pisces palace. (This is because the Earth's revolution causes the relative positions of the sun and other stars to change when viewed from Earth.)
    From an astronomical point of view, the Spring Equinox solar term has special significance. This is because the constellation in which the sun is located on the Spring Equinox day each year has a slight movement, which is caused by special changes in the Earth's revolution around the sun. About two thousand years ago, the sun was in the Aries constellation on the Spring Equinox, commonly known as the sun entering the Aries palace. Ancient Greek countries held a celebration ceremony on the first 15th day of the lunar month after the Spring Equinox, called the Aries Victory Festival. Residents of various places selected pure white sheep, loaded them with flowers, and held races to revel to their hearts' content. It is very similar to our former Spring Ox Celebration.
    In summer, the days are long and the nights are short. On the Summer Solstice, the day is the longest and the night is the shortest (at 40 degrees north latitude, the day is 15 hours long and the night is 9 hours long). After the Summer Solstice, the days gradually become shorter. On the Autumn Equinox, the day and night are equally divided. After that, the days gradually become shorter and the nights gradually become longer. On the Winter Solstice, the day is the shortest and the night is the longest (the night is 15 hours long and the day is 9 hours long). On the Spring Equinox, the day and night return to 12 hours each. Therefore, as the saying goes, the Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox have equal day and night. At this time, the Earth moves to such a position that the sun shines directly on the equator, so the time of day is equal in the northern and southern hemispheres, and the climate is almost the same. When it is the Spring Equinox in our northern hemisphere, it is the Autumn Equinox in the southern hemisphere.
    The cycle of cold and heat, spring, summer, autumn, and winter is the best proof of the Earth's movement around the sun. In our country, the beginning of the four seasons of the year is marked by the Beginning of Spring, Beginning of Summer, Beginning of Autumn, and Beginning of Winter, but astronomically, the beginning of spring, summer, autumn, and winter is marked by the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, and Winter Solstice as the first day of each season. Today is the Spring Equinox, which is the beginning of spring in astronomy. From now on, spring has come to the world.

### 春分秋分　昼夜平分

    春分秋分　昼夜平分
    秦晓
    春分是二十四节气中的一个大节气。远在两千多年前的春秋时代，由于农业上的需要，我国已经用土圭测定太阳影子长短的办法来定出春分、秋分、冬至、夏至这四大节气；其他节气约到秦朝时代才逐渐完备。所谓土圭就是测日影的玉器，中立一杆，用每天中午太阳照射下来的杆影长短不同，定出哪一天什么节气到来。同时又和夜间观测星象紧紧结合起来，看看每天半夜南方天空什么星座当头，就可以知道太阳现在是在什么星座；古人按每月太阳所进入的星座划分节气。现在，春分这一天太阳刚好进入双鱼星座，或者称为双鱼宫。（这是由于地球的公转，使人们从地球上看去，太阳和其他星星的位置起了相对变化。）
    从天文角度来看，春分这一节气具有特殊意义。因为每年太阳于春分日所在的星座是有微小的移动的，这是由于地球绕太阳公转运动中有特殊变化所引起的。大约在二千年前，春分这一天太阳是在白羊星座，俗称太阳入白羊宫。古希腊国家，就在春分后第一个阴历15日这一天举行庆祝仪式，称为白羊胜节，各地居民选择纯白色的羊子，装载着鲜花举行赛会，尽情狂欢。很像我国从前的春牛祝岁。
    夏天昼长夜短，至夏至那天白昼最长，夜最短（在北纬四十度地方昼长十五小时，夜晚九小时）。夏至以后，白天又渐短；到秋分日，昼夜平分。以后白昼渐短而夜渐长，到冬至日昼最短而夜最长（夜长十五小时昼长九小时），到春分这一天，又恢复昼夜各是十二小时。所以俗话说，春分秋分，昼夜平分。这时候，地球运动到这样的位置，太阳刚好直照赤道，因此地球南北半球时间早晚相等，而且气候寒冷也差不多。当我们北半球是春分日，在南半球却是秋分日了。
    寒来暑往，春夏秋冬，周而复始，这是地球绕太阳运动的最好证明。在我国以立春、立夏、立秋、立冬作为一年四季开头的日子，可是在天文学上，春、夏、秋、冬的开始却以春分、夏至、秋分、冬至作为每个季节的第一天。今天春分，正是天文学上春天的开始。自此以后，春到人间了。
