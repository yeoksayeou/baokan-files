Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th. The Ministry of Forestry recently held a national afforestation gardenization conference in Guangdong to fully study and specifically deploy the work of accelerating afforestation speed and striving to realize the gardenization of the motherland's land as soon as possible.

The meeting held that conscientiously implementing the policy of relying mainly on people's communes for afforestation, while actively developing state-owned afforestation as two legs walking, is the key to developing afforestation faster, better, and more comprehensively. In recent years, thanks to relying on the leadership of Party committees at all levels and carrying out mass movements on a large scale, a new situation has emerged in which the whole party and all people develop afforestation rapidly, well, economically, and abundantly. According to the experience of various places: relying on people's communes for afforestation and carrying out mass movements on a large scale is the fundamental guarantee for completing afforestation and forest management plans and accelerating the speed of greening. At the same time, state-owned forest farms still have major responsibilities in accelerating the greening of barren mountains and wastelands that communes cannot currently manage, establishing national timber forest bases, carrying out fast-growing and high-yielding forest tree movements, conducting scientific research and demonstrations, and promoting advanced experience. Therefore, the state-owned afforestation cause must continue to be strengthened and developed year by year in a certain proportion. In order to combine long-term interests with immediate interests, both state-owned forest farms and commune-run forest farms should focus on afforestation and forest management, while also developing diversified operations centered on the processing of forestry by-products in order to increase more income.

The meeting pointed out: In order to realize the gardenization of the land, it is first necessary to accelerate the speed of greening barren mountains and wastelands and improve the quality of tree planting and afforestation. At the same time, the scope of gardenization should face the land, and should not be limited to a few points and lines. The view that beautifying urban and rural residential areas is enough to realize gardenization is not comprehensive. The primary purpose of realizing the gardenization of the land is to transform nature and develop production. Therefore, in the work of gardenization of the land, there must be a clear production point of view, starting from production, focusing on the overall situation, adapting to local conditions, paying attention to the needs of the masses and national characteristics, and combining it with the development of local specialty production.

The meeting emphasized that in areas near industrial and mining railways and people's communes lacking timber and fuel, special attention should be paid to establishing sufficient timber forest bases and fuel wood forest bases as soon as possible, in order to strive to achieve self-sufficiency in various timber needs with a surplus in the short term.

The meeting finally called on all localities to take advantage of the good spring season to further push the spring afforestation movement to a new climax on the basis of the current vigorous development of the afforestation movement. At the same time, it is necessary to seize the seedling cultivation work and prepare enough fine varieties of strong seedlings to supply the needs of afforestation.

More than 160 representatives from forestry departments and forestry scientific research units of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participated in the meeting. The meeting started on February 20th and ended on March 19th. During the meeting, the representatives visited the afforestation gardenization work of eight counties and cities in mountainous and coastal areas and exchanged experiences.

    提高造林质量，加快绿化速度
    林业部召开造林园林化会议布置今年工作
    新华社广州26日电　林业部最近在广东召开的全国造林园林化会议，就加快造林速度，和争取早日实现祖国大地园林化的工作进行了充分的研究和具体部署。
    会议认为，认真贯彻以依靠人民公社造林为主，同时积极发展国营造林的两条腿走路的方针，是更快更好更全面地发展造林事业的关键。几年来，由于依靠各级党委领导和大搞群众运动，出现了全党全民多快好省地发展造林事业的新局面。根据各地经验：依靠人民公社造林，大搞群众运动，是完成造林营林计划，加快绿化速度的根本保证；同时，国营林场在加速绿化当前公社力所不及的荒山荒地、建立国家用材林基地、开展林木速生丰产运动、进行科学研究和示范、推广先进经验等方面，仍然负有重大的责任。因此，国营造林事业必须继续加强，按一定比例逐年发展。为了使长远利益和眼前利益结合起来，不论国营林场或社办林场，都应当以造林营林为主，同时开展以林业副产品加工为中心的多种经营，以便增加更多的收入。
    会议指出：为了实现大地园林化，首先要加快绿化荒山荒地的速度和提高植树造林的质量。同时，园林化的范围应该面向大地，不能局限于几个点线，那些认为只要美化城乡居民点就算实现园林化的看法是不全面的。实现大地园林化首要目的是改造自然，发展生产。因此，在大地园林化的工作中，必须有明确的生产观点，从生产出发，从全局着眼，因地制宜，注意群众需要和民族特点，并且与发展土特产生产相结合。
    会议强调，在工矿铁路附近地区和缺乏木材、燃料的人民公社，要特别注意尽快地建立足够的用材林基地和薪炭林基地，以争取在短期内达到各种用材自给有余。
    会议最后要求各地乘大好春光在目前造林运动蓬勃发展的基础上，进一步把春季造林运动推向新的高潮。同时，要抓紧育苗工作，准备足够良种壮苗供应造林需要。
    参加这次会议的有各省、市、自治区林业部门和林业科学研究单位的代表共一百六十多人。会议从2月20日开始至3月19日结束。会议期间，代表们曾在山区和沿海地区参观了八个县市的造林园林化工作，并交流了经验。
