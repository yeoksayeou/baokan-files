    Human Dignity
    Li Feng
    The capitalist world produces unfounded news every day. Dulles and the reactionary newspapers of the United States and Britain have been frantically fabricating "news" about the Chinese People's Communes since November of last year, saying that the People's Communes have turned the six hundred million Chinese people into "slaves" and "material units," and that the "commune system" is a "hell" that eliminates "human dignity," and so on.
    It is true that there are indeed "hells" in the world that treat people as "slaves," "material units," and damage "human dignity." This is the system in which a minority oppresses and exploits the majority. The slave owner passed this hell on to his son, the landlord, and the landlord passed it on to his descendants, the capitalists. This hell has been destroyed in China and all socialist countries, and a paradise on earth—socialist and communist society—is being built. However, in the capitalist world, this hell continues to damage the dignity of the working people today. Here are two "peaks" in Britain and the United States that symbolize the damage to "human dignity" as proof. On February 10, the British Minister of Labour, Macleod, announced in the House of Commons that the total number of unemployed in Britain had increased by another 88,000 in January, reaching 620,000. British economists say that this is not the total number of unemployed, but it is the highest "peak" of unemployment in Britain in more than ten years since the war. On March 2, the American "National Guardian" reported that there were more than 4.7 million unemployed in the United States in January, not including those working part-time and about one million people looking for work for the first time (presumably these one million people are not included in the unemployment figures because there is no "job" to "lose"). This is the highest "peak" of unemployment in January since World War II. These two "peaks" piled up by millions of groaning, starving lives can serve as a portrayal of "human dignity" in capitalist society. Workers in factories have lost their human dignity because they are treated as slaves by capitalists, and they don't even have the opportunity to be slaves. As human beings, they are superfluous. Thus, the "civilized" capitalist system treats them as material units such as toys and trees. In cities such as London and New York, tens of thousands of good women are reduced to prostitutes; in Detroit, the American automobile capital, which is known as the world's automobile capital, among the 200,000 unemployed workers, there are many pale and thin unemployed people who make a living by selling their blood. They have been transformed from people into "material units" that produce blood. Capitalists rely on them to exploit the dignity of the working people, so that their dogs can enjoy living rights that ordinary people do not have, just like their wives. On the streets of cities such as London and New York, while millions of unemployed people are groaning with hunger, the dogs of the rich are devouring biscuits, canned food, and tonics made of wheat, cod liver oil, liver, and meat, and wearing nylon pajamas worth thirty dollars and water-lapped leather shoulders worth three hundred dollars. Life in capitalist society is divided into the "two extremes" of rich and poor. The capitalists in the extreme of wealth have lost their humanity, and the people in the extreme of poverty have lost their human dignity.
    In contrast to capitalist society, what about the "human dignity" of the members of our People's Communes, which is attacked by the reactionary Western press? Here, the old are respected, the young are cared for, men and women are equal, everyone has a job, everyone has food, and everyone is the master of the country. This is a dignity that the working people of the Chinese nation have not had for thousands of years, and it is also a human dignity that capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States cannot have. As a member of a People's Commune, I lived in the commune for half a year. There, to explain to primary school students what it means to insult human dignity, one can only import teaching materials from capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States.

    人的尊严
    李峰
    资本主义世界天天产生着毫无事实根据的新闻。杜勒斯和美英等国的反动报刊，从去年11月份以来，疯狂地捏造有关中国人民公社的“新闻”，说人民公社使六亿中国人民成了“奴隶”和“物质单位”，说“公社制度”是消灭“人的尊严”的“地狱”等等。
    不错，世界上的确有把人当成“奴隶”、“物质单位”和损害“人的尊严”的“地狱”。这就是少数人压迫和剥削多数人的制度。奴隶主把这个地狱传给了他的儿子地主，地主又传给了他的下辈资本家。这个地狱在中国和所有社会主义国家都被捣毁了，而且正在建筑人间天堂——社会主义和共产主义社会。但是，在资本主义世界，这个地狱今天还在损害着劳动人民的尊严。这里有英美标志损害“人的尊严”的两座“高峰”为证。2月10日，英国劳工大臣麦克里奥得在下院宣布，英国失业总人数1月份内又增加了八万八千人，达到了六十二万。英国的经济学家说，这不是失业人数的全部，但这却是战后英国十几年来失业人数的最“高峰”。3月2日，美国“国民前卫报”报道：美国1月份有四百七十多万人失业，其中不包括部分时间工作的人和大约一百万第一次找工作的人（大概这一百万人是因为无“业”可“失”，所以不包括在失业数内）。这是第二次世界大战以来1月份失业人数的最“高峰”。这两座上百万呻吟饥饿的生命堆成的“高峰”，可以作为资本主义社会“人的尊严”的写照。工厂里的工人因为被资本家当作奴隶而失掉了人的尊严，他们连当奴隶的机会也没有了。作为人，他们是多余了。于是，“文明的”资本主义制度，就把他们当作玩具和树木之类的物质单位。在伦敦和纽约等城市，成千上万的善良的妇女沦为娼妓；在号称世界汽车首都的美国底特律二十万失业工人中，有许多苍白瘦弱的失业者靠出卖自己的血糊口。他们由人变成了生产鲜血的“物质单位”。资本家依靠他们剥削劳动人民的尊严，使他们的狗也和他们的太太那样享有普通人所没有的生活权利。伦敦和纽约等城市的街上，在数百万失业者呻吟饥饿的同时，富豪们的狗却吞嚼着用小麦、鱼肝油、肝、肉做的饼干，罐头和补药，穿戴着价值三十美元的尼龙睡衣和三百美元的水络皮肩。资本主义社会生活分成了穷富“两极”，富极里的资本家丧失了人性，穷极里的人失掉了人的尊严。
    同资本主义社会相对照，西方反动报刊所攻击的我国人民公社社员“人的尊严”如何呢？在这里，老有所尊，少有所养，男女平等，人人有工作，人人有饭吃，人人是国家的主人。这是中华民族的劳动人民几千年来没有过的尊严，也是英美等资本主义国家不可能有的人的尊严。我作为一个人民公社的社员，曾经在公社里生活了半年，在那里，要给小学生讲解什么是侮辱人的尊严，只能从英美等资本主义国家进口教材了。
