Seize the Opportunity, Rush to Transport Timber
*People's Daily* Commentator
    Timber is an indispensable material in production and construction. To meet the needs of a greater leap forward in all national production and construction undertakings this year, we must produce enough suitable timber and ensure timely supply according to plan.
    This year, the national timber production task has increased by 43% compared to last year, of which the southern forest areas are responsible for about half. Whether the timber production task of the southern forest areas can be completed depends on whether it can be transported out in time.
    At present, the southern forest areas mainly rely on waterway transportation, and a large part needs to be transported in small streams and rivers. Transporting timber in small streams and rivers is often subject to seasonal restrictions, because the water in small streams and rivers easily rises and falls. There are often rainstorms and unstable water conditions in summer, while in autumn and winter the water is too low for floating. Only the spring water is the "golden" season for floating timber. Therefore, seizing the favorable opportunity of spring, making every effort to rush to transport timber, and transporting the timber to rivers that can be floated year-round as early as possible is the important task of the forest areas in the southern provinces.
    Although the southern provinces may encounter some specific difficulties in completing this year's huge timber floating task, they also have more favorable conditions than last year. That is: after the people's communes, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all developed greatly and the labor force is unified, there is a reliable guarantee for the development of forestry production. After vigorously implementing the general line of socialist construction and the all-round leap forward in production last year, the vast number of forestry workers have further improved their ideological awareness and technical level, laying a good foundation for a greater leap forward this year. In particular, the spring water in the south this year has come early, and the situation is even more favorable to us. Therefore, we must act quickly and keep up with all the work immediately. If we can seize this favorable opportunity, we can bring the timber down earlier this year and supply the needs of various constructions in a timely manner. The current problem is: how enterprise leaders can quickly catch up. Experience has proved that as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party and widely mobilize the masses, it is entirely possible to complete this year's timber collection and transportation tasks ahead of schedule. For example, under the leadership of the Party, various places in Anhui have widely mobilized the masses to carry out a crash program of small river transportation, which has set off a climax of nearly 40,000 people rushing to transport timber. Recently, 50,000 cubic meters of timber and 250,000 mao bamboo have been transported to storage yards and allocated along the way; breaking through the small river pass, 114,200 cubic meters of timber and 1.16 million mao bamboo have been transported to the big river.
    To rush to transport timber, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. Organize the masses to widely carry out socialist labor competitions, and create new high-yield timber transportation records with greater revolutionary vigor. In the competition, we must conduct timely inspections, evaluations, and rewards; and through visits, workers' riverside research associations, on-site meetings, and other forms, we must timely summarize and exchange advanced production experiences to promote the continuous development of mass movements.
    In the mass competition movement, we must focus on promoting advanced experience and technological revolution to continuously improve labor productivity. The technical foundation of timber production in the south is relatively weak, coupled with high mountains and long distances, dangerous transportation, and poor transportation conditions. Therefore, passing the timber transportation barrier is a major event in timber production in the south. In recent years, the South has created many valuable experiences in timber water transport, which must be carefully summarized and promoted. For example, the Laibang Logging Team of the Yuexi County Forestry Bureau in Anhui Province established a water slide 1,540 meters long in the Huangbo Mountain forest area, which is more than 1,000 meters above sea level, with a slope of more than 50 degrees and steep mountains, which saved a lot of manpower and greatly improved production efficiency. Another example is Jingning County in Zhejiang Province taking advantage of the spring water to "drive sheep" (scatter timber in the river for floating); Qiyang Forest Area in Hunan Province floating in streams and rivers, and the channel transportation of timber in the high mountain forest area of the South Sichuan Forestry Bureau are all good experiences. There are many advanced experiences in various places, and as long as they are promoted or improved according to local conditions, the efficiency of timber floating can be improved. In timber floating, we should mobilize the masses to focus on local methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and boldly create around the key issues in production. We should organize the masses to seriously study and promote existing experiences. Only in this way can we effectively improve production and improve technology, and continuously give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.
    While rushing to transport timber, all localities must also vigorously grasp the basic construction of water transport. Take advantage of the small water season to整治林区河道 rectify river courses in forest areas, carry out blasting reefs and clearing of rubble, and other work; and according to the specific conditions of the rivers, take simple measures to repair some weirs and gates, or build earth reservoirs at the headwaters to store water, so as to fully utilize water power, control the flow, and ensure the normal floating of timber. More importantly, we must build some bamboo cable and steel rope horizontal or longitudinal river cables according to local conditions, and do a good job in flood prevention and security work for water transport. At the same time, we must seize the time to repair forest roads, aerial ropeways, bamboo and wood slides, and various types of timber transportation facilities, and take active and effective measures to transport timber to the side of small streams in batches in a timely manner, waiting for water to be transported or storing water for floating. In this way, the processes of felling, collecting and transporting timber, floating in small streams, transporting in big rivers, and exiting the river can be closely linked, so that timber can be supplied to various undertakings according to plan.

    抓紧时机，抢运木材
    本报评论员
    木材是生产和建设中不可缺少的材料，为了满足今年全国各项生产和建设事业更大跃进的需要，必须生产出足够的适用的木材，并要做到按计划及时供应。
    今年全国的木材生产任务较去年增加了43％，其中南方林区所负担的任务约占一半左右。南方各林区的木材生产任务能否完成，关键在于能否及时运出来。
    目前南方林区主要是依靠水路运输，有很大一部分要在小溪小河中运送。在小溪小河里运材，常常易受季节性的限制，因为小溪小河的水易涨易落，夏天多暴雨水势不稳，秋冬两季水又很小不能流送，只有春水才是流送木材的“黄金”季节。因此，紧紧地抓住春季这个有利时机，千方百计地抢运木材，把木材及早地运到常年可以流送的河流，是目前南方各省林区的重要任务。
    南方各省完成今年巨大的木材流送任务，虽然可能遇到一些具体困难，但也有比去年更为有利的条件。这就是：人民公社化后农、林、牧、副、渔五业全面大发展，统一安排劳力，对发展林业生产有了可靠的保证。经过去年大力贯彻社会主义建设总路线和生产全面大跃进，广大林业职工进一步提高了思想觉悟和技术水平，为今年更大的跃进打下了良好基础。特别是今年南方春水来得早，形势对我们更为有利，因此必须赶快行动起来，使各项工作马上跟上去。如果我们能够抓住这个有利时机，今年就可以提早把木材运下来，及时地供应各项建设需要。当前的问题在于：企业领导者怎样迅速地赶上去。经验证明，只要紧紧地依靠党的领导，把群众广泛地发动起来，提前完成今年木材的集运任务是完全可能的。如安徽各地在党的领导下广泛地发动群众突击小河运输，已经掀起了将近四万人抢运木材的高潮，最近运到储木场和途中调拨的木材已有五万立方公尺，毛竹二十五万根；突破小河关，运到大河的木材已达十一万四千二百立方公尺，运到大河的毛竹有一百一十六万根。
    抢运木材，必须大搞群众运动。组织群众广泛地开展社会主义劳动竞赛，用更大的革命干劲创造出新的运材高产纪录。在竞赛中要及时地进行检查、评比、奖励；并通过参观、工人河边研究会、现场会议等形式，及时地总结与交流先进生产经验，推动群众运动不断向前发展。
    在群众竞赛运动中要以推广先进经验和技术革命为中心，不断地提高劳动生产率。南方木材生产的技术基础比较薄弱，加上山高路远，交通险阻，运输条件差，因此过好木材运输关，是南方木材生产的大事。近几年来，南方各地在木材水运方面创造了很多宝贵经验，必须认真地加以总结与推广。如：安徽岳西县林业局来榜采伐队在拔海一千多公尺、坡度五十度以上、山势险峻的黄伯山林区建立了一条长达一千五百四十公尺的水滑道，节省了大量人力，大大地提高了生产效率。另如浙江景宁县趁春水“赶羊”（把木材散在河里流送）；湖南祁阳林区溪河流送以及川南森工局的高山林区渠道运材等经验，都是很好的。各地先进的经验很多，只要因地制宜地推广或改进，都可以提高木材流送效率。在木材流送中应发动群众以土为主、土洋结合，围绕生产中的关键问题大胆创造。对已有的经验，要组织群众认真学习与推广。只有如此，才能有效地改进生产和提高技术，不断地发挥群众的积极性和创造性。
    各地在抢运木材的同时，还要狠狠地抓水运的基本建设工作。趁小水季节整治林区河道，进行炸礁和清理乱石等工作；并按照河流的具体情况，采取简易的办法修理一些堰、闸，或在水源头修建土水库储水，以充分利用水力，控制流量，保证木材的正常流送。更重要的是，要因地制宜地修建一些竹缆、钢绳的横河绠或顺河绠，作好水运防洪保安工作。同时，要抓紧修好林区道路、索道、竹木滑道和多种多样的运材设施，采取积极有效的办法，及时把木材分批运到小溪旁边，等水待运或蓄水流送。这样，就能使采伐、集运材、小溪流送、大河运输及出河等工序紧密地衔接起来，使木材按计划地供应各项事业的需要。
