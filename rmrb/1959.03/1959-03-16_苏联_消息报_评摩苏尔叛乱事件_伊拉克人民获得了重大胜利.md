Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an article on March 15 commenting on the Mosul rebellion in Iraq. The article stated that the Iraqi people, in eliminating the insurgents' riots, had achieved a significant victory in their historical development. The author of the article, Khokhlov, wrote that the Iraqi people have further consolidated the national independence of their country.

The article said that independent Asian and African countries that have broken free from colonial oppression are a thorn in the side of the imperialists. They provoke incidents here and there, hindering the normal development of these countries. The young Republic of Iraq has not been spared this fate.

The Mosul incident fully raises the question: the people of the Arab countries, who have finally achieved independence, must unite; they must vigilantly defend their historical achievements, protecting them from the constant attacks of imperialist aggressors, because any cracks in the relations between Arab countries will be exploited by imperialist aggressors. Moreover, the argument made by Cairo newspapers, such as "Al-Ahram," that "other leaders (the leaders of the rebellion - author) will emerge to inherit the cause of the dead," will create difficulties for the government of the Republic of Iraq, which will only please the imperialist blocs and harm the Arab countries.

The article said that similar platitudes disseminated by anti-Arab propaganda from across the ocean aim to cause discord among Arabs and turn the Middle East into a permanent source of dangerous tension.

    苏联“消息报”评摩苏尔叛乱事件
    伊拉克人民获得了重大胜利
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“消息报”15日发表文章，评伊拉克摩苏尔叛乱。文章写道，伊拉克人民在消灭了叛乱者的暴动以后，在自己的历史发展中获得了重大的胜利。文章作者霍赫洛夫写道，伊拉克人民更加巩固了国家的民族独立。
    文章说，摆脱了殖民主义压迫的亚非独立国家是帝国主义者的眼中钉。他们时而在这里，时而在那里挑起事件，阻碍这些国家的正常发展。年青的伊拉克共和国也没有免于这种遭遇。
    摩苏尔事件充分地提出了这样的问题：好容易取得了独立的阿拉伯各国人民必须团结起来；必须警惕地保卫着自己的历史成果，使它们免遭帝国主义侵略者的不断攻击，因为，阿拉伯国家相互关系中的任何裂缝都会被帝国主义侵略者所利用的。而且，开罗报纸，例如“埃及报”所说的“会出现另一些领袖
  （叛乱的领袖——作者）来继承死者的事业”，这种论调会使伊拉克共和国政府遇到困难，而这只会使帝国主义集团更加高兴，并使阿拉伯国家受到损害。
    文章说，来自大洋彼岸的反阿拉伯宣传所散布的类似滥调，其目的是使阿拉伯人彼此发生争吵，是要把中近东地区变成危险的紧张局势的永久策源地。
