    Shaanxi: Preventing and Controlling Wheat Stripe Rust
    In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, the people of Shaanxi Province are conducting large-scale wheat stripe rust prevention and control work to completely eliminate wheat stripe rust before the wheat begins to joint.
    Wheat stripe rust is a common disease in wheat, and in the past it was rarely possible to completely eliminate it. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in wheat production this year compared to last year, as early as December last year, under the leadership of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Shaanxi Province launched a mass movement to eliminate stripe rust throughout the province. All wheat fields in the province that had previously experienced stripe rust were universally treated once, and some were treated two to four times, basically controlling the development of stripe rust. In order to improve the prevention and control organizations, sixteen joint prevention areas were established in the province. In the low-temperature areas along the Wei River, where stripe rust is prone to occur, counties established monitoring stations, and communes established prevention and control core groups, turning prevention and control work into a regular task. Many counties also trained technical teams. Weinan County trained more than 4,800 stripe rust prevention and control technicians. In the prevention and control work, various localities successively created methods such as burying soil and cutting leaves, and absorbed the experience of the masses in spraying with urine and castor leaf water, which made the province's stripe rust prevention and control work achieve great results. Due to these conditions, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee recently decided that from now on, within about half a month, they will carry out another universal wheat stripe rust elimination campaign throughout the province to completely eliminate stripe rust before the wheat begins to joint.
    According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities immediately launched large-scale activities to prevent and control wheat stripe rust. Chang'an County conducted a comprehensive census of all wheat. Weinan, Pucheng and other counties have invested a large amount of manpower to strengthen the prevention and control of wheat stripe rust. An agricultural science and technology team jointly formed by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee has now set off to nineteen counties (cities) in Guanzhong to strengthen the technical guidance of stripe rust prevention and control. The members of this scientific and technological team include more than 1,000 experts, professors, and students from Northwest University, Northwest Agricultural College, Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science, and the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

    Hebei: Thoroughly Eliminate Third-Class Seedlings
    The broad masses of commune members in the wheat-producing areas of Hebei are organizing professional teams like they manage high-yield fields to strengthen the management of third-class seedling wheat fields, demanding the thorough elimination of third-class seedlings.
    The 35 million mu of wheat in Hebei Province is generally more robust than in previous years. However, a small number of wheat fields, compared with the well-grown wheat fields, have become third-class seedlings. In order to eliminate third-class seedlings, party organizations at all levels in various places first mobilized the masses to carry out debates, so that the masses could recognize the great significance of managing third-class seedlings well.
    In the management upsurge to eliminate third-class seedlings, many communes have adopted measures for managing high-yield fields: fixing labor, organizing professional teams, and implementing a responsibility system with fixed personnel, fixed measures, fixed time, and fixed rewards and punishments. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members has greatly increased, and the effect is remarkable. In Handan Prefecture, due to the fixing of more than 200,000 laborers and the formation of many professional teams, after contracting management by ridges and plots, the third-class seedlings of about 400,000 mu of wheat fields have been upgraded. After doing this in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, according to incomplete statistics, more than 800,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been eliminated. The more than 1,100 mu of third-class seedlings upgraded in Liuhaizhuang Commune, Gaocheng, have increased the number of plants per mu from the original 200,000 to 300,000 to 500,000 to 600,000.
    In the management of wheat fields to eliminate third-class seedlings, various localities have adopted different management measures according to the different causes of the formation of third-class seedlings, so the effect is remarkable. The more than 25,000 mu of third-class seedlings in Shexian County, after inspection and analysis, were mainly short of water and fertilizer. In response to this situation, the county organized more than 50,000 people to carry out a watering and topdressing campaign, so that the third-class seedlings could develop and grow normally. The wheat planted on saline-alkali land in Jingzhou Commune, Wuqiao County, became third-class seedlings due to salt and alkali damage. The commune mobilized 5,600 commune members to stop the harm of salt and alkali. The wheat seedlings have turned from yellow to green and are growing vigorously.

    Beijing Suburbs: Vow to Strive for More Than 1,000 Jin Per Mu
    The people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are taking advantage of the good spring light to take concrete measures to rush through the wheat regreening period and vow to strive for more than 1,000 jin of wheat per mu.
    The 1.46 million mu of wheat fields in the suburbs of Beijing are regreening. After deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization last year, coupled with careful management throughout the winter, the wheat seedlings are growing densely, evenly, neatly, and strongly. According to investigations by relevant departments, the average number of wheat seedlings per mu is more than 700,000, and there is great hope for increasing wheat production.
    In order to turn the possibility of high yield into reality, various localities in the suburbs have universally carried out the work of "eight inspections" and "five determinations": inspect deep plowing, inspect close planting, inspect fertilizer, inspect water conservancy, inspect varieties, inspect tillering, inspect diseases, and inspect management; according to the results of the eight inspections, determine labor, determine yield, determine measures, determine plots, and determine leadership. In the "eight inspections" and "five determinations" work, after specific inspections and calculations, each commune determined production by plot, and the average yield per mu was generally more than 1,000 jin. Cadres and commune members are full of confidence and are carrying out topdressing, raking, and watering intensively. Since last winter, the 100,000 mu of wheat in Xiji People's Commune, Tongzhou District, have been universally rolled, watered, and topdressed once, and are currently undergoing the second raking and topdressing; the 105 local fertilizer plants in Yongledian Commune have produced a large amount of local fertilizer, and the average amount of local fertilizer per mu of wheat land is more than 1,800 jin. In order to let the wheat drink enough, the three communes of Anding, Caiyu, and Huangcun in Daxing District jointly renovated the Qingnian Reservoir, which can hold more than 6 million cubic meters of water, and diverted Yongding River water to irrigate the wheat fields. Chengguan People's Commune in Pinggu County organized a well-drilling team to drill 210 wells in areas lacking water sources in order to realize the garden-style irrigation of wheat fields.
    In order to strengthen wheat field management, various communes have universally established a professional front for wheat management, and with the spirit of closely linking each link and striving for perfection, they have formulated specific measures to fight hard for 120 days and pass the five stages of regreening and seedling protection, jointing and sitting, heading and flowering, grain filling and grain attack, and careful harvesting to ensure that fertilizer and water are not lacking. They also established a meteorological network and a pest and disease information network to pay close attention to frost and frost prevention, pest and disease control, and lodging prevention to ensure a bumper wheat harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 14th:
    Liaoning: Fight the First Battle of Spring Plowing and Sowing
    Under the slogan of "The Grain Commander Ascends the Tent, Wheat First," Liaoning farmers are starting plowing and sowing spring wheat early, striving to fight the first battle of spring plowing and sowing well.
    This year, spring came early to both sides of the Liao River. The wheat sowing work in the main spring wheat producing areas along the river, such as Liaozhong, Tai'an, and Xinmin, is generally half a month to a month earlier than last year.
    Liaoning farmers have always believed that wheat is a low-yield crop, so they are unwilling to plant more and do not take care of it carefully. Since the provinces inside the customs frequently reported high-yield news of wheat last year, coupled with the in-depth publicity and education of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture in various places after autumn, the farmers' thinking has undergone great changes. Many communes plan to actively expand wheat planting and are determined to strive for high yields. It is estimated that the province's wheat planting area will more than double this year compared to last year. In order to grow wheat well and start the first shot of spring plowing and sowing, the people's communes in various places have universally formulated technical measures to strive for high wheat yields during the preparation period, based on the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. The people's communes in Tai'an County also organized commune members to carry out a sowing competition to grow wheat well, seize high yields, and make a big fuss about technical revolution. Therefore, the quality of wheat sowing in various places this year is better than in previous years. Most wheat fields have been deeply plowed, leveled, and irrigated, achieving the selection of fine varieties, close planting, and increased basal fertilizer, changing the past extensive phenomenon of wheat fields not being fertilized. Large-area high-yield wheat fields have also universally adopted garden-style cultivation methods, striving to break through the 1,000 jin per mu mark and create high-yield records of 2,000 jin, 3,000 jin, and 4,000 jin, setting a high-yield example for autumn crops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 14th:
    Anhui: Overcome the Wheat Jointing Stage Well
    The nearly 40 million mu of wheat fields in Anhui Province are generally growing well. In order to overcome the jointing stage well and strive for large and numerous ears, the commune members of the people's communes in various places are currently working more deeply and meticulously in wheat field management under the slogans of "Not letting go of one move, not relaxing one step" and "Grain is not in hand, management is not relaxed." At present, the number of people in the province participating in professional wheat field management teams has increased from the original 2.34 million to more than 3.82 million.
    In order to overcome the wheat jointing stage well, many areas have put forward practical and feasible field management measures. The 660,000 mu of wheat in Dangshan County, Huaibei, is beginning to joint. According to the local wheat field growth situation, the county has taken the following measures to strengthen wheat field management. First, observe the seedlings and topdress. For high-yield fields with particularly good growth, focus on applying phosphate and potash fertilizers to facilitate strong stalks and grain formation; general high-yield fields apply both phosphate and potash fertilizers and nitrogen fertilizers; late-planted wheat focuses on applying nitrogen fertilizers and quick-acting fertilizers. And the amount of fertilizer per mu was determined. Second, vigorously grasp irrigation. Different amounts of water are irrigated according to the different growth conditions of wheat seedlings and geological conditions to promote strong stalks and prevent lodging. Third, comprehensively carry out frost prevention, freeze prevention, lodging prevention, and pest and disease prevention. The county has organized 620 weather forecast and prediction teams; smoke stoves have been dug in the heads of each wheat field to prepare for smoke to prevent frost and freeze; in order to prevent and control pests and diseases, the county has prepared 10,000 jin and 1,000 pieces of medicines and machinery. Fourth, weed and clear the bottom to promote wheat ventilation and strong stalks. Fifth, improve the wheat field file system and further carry out technical research activities.
    At present, the wheat seedlings in various parts of Anhui Province are generally still in the peak period of regreening, except for some that have already started to joint, and a few have just started to regreen. In order to strengthen the management of various wheat fields, various localities have recently held on-site meetings to strengthen the field management of various types of wheat seedlings, exchanged advanced experience in a timely manner, and promoted more meticulous wheat field management.

    春光好  麦苗长  勤管理  保丰收	陕西：防治小麦条锈病
    新华社西安14日电　陕西省各地人民为确保小麦丰收，把小麦条锈病全部消灭在小麦拔节以前，目前正在开展大规模的小麦条锈病防治工作。
    小麦条锈病是小麦中普遍流行的病害，过去很少可能彻底消灭它。为了争取今年的小麦生产比去年有更大的跃进，早在去年12月，陕西省人民在中共陕西省委领导下，就在全省范围内掀起了一个消灭条锈病的群众运动，全省凡是过去发生过条锈病的麦田普遍防治了一次，有的防治了两次到四次，基本上控制了条锈病的发展。为了健全防治机构，全省先后建立了十六个联防区，沿渭河两岸容易发生条锈病的低温地区，县县设立了测报站，社社设立了防治核心小组，把防治工作变成经常性的任务。许多县还训练了技术队伍，渭南县先后训练了四千八百多名防治条锈病的技术员。各地在防治工作中，先后创造了埋土切叶和摘除麦叶等方法，并吸收了群众中用尿水、蓖麻叶水喷洒等经验，使全省防治条锈病的工作取得了很大的成绩。由于具备了这些条件，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会最近决定从现在起，在大约半个月的时间内，在全省范围内再普遍开展一次消灭小麦条锈病工作，把条锈病全部消灭在小麦拔节以前。
    根据省委的指示，各地立即开展了大规模的防治小麦条锈病的活动。长安县对所有的小麦都进行了一次全面普查；渭南、蒲城等县投入了大批人力加强小麦条锈病的防治工作。由中共陕西省委和省人民委员会联合组成的农业科学技术队伍，现在已经开赴关中十九个县（市），加强防治条锈病的技术指导工作。参加这支科学技术队伍的成员，有西北大学、西北农学院、西北生物土壤研究所和中国农业科学院陕西分院等单位的专家、教授、学生共一千余人。	河北：彻底消灭三类苗
    新华社天津14日电　河北各产麦区的广大社员群众，正在像管理丰产田一样地组织专业队，加强三类苗麦田管理工作，要求彻底消灭三类苗。
    河北省的三千五百万亩小麦，普遍比往年茁壮。但是，有少数麦田，和长得好的麦田比较起来，就成了三类苗。为了消灭三类苗，各地各级党组织，首先发动群众开展辩论，让群众认清管好三类苗的重大意义。
    许多公社在消灭三类苗的管理高潮中，采用了管理高额丰产田的措施：固定劳力、组织专业队，推行定人、定措施、定时间、定奖惩的责任制。广大社员干劲大增，效果显著。邯郸专区由于固定了二十多万个劳力，组成了许多个专业队，经过分垅分块的包干管理后，约有四十多万亩麦田的三类苗升了级。石家庄专区各地这样作了以后，据不完全统计，已经消灭三类苗八十多万亩。藁城刘海庄公社升了级的一千一百多亩三类苗，每亩株数已由原来的二十万到三十万株，增加到五十万到六十万株。
    各地在消灭三类苗的麦田管理中，都根据形成三类苗的不同原因，采取了不同的管理措施，因此效果显著。涉县的二万五千多亩三类苗，经过检查分析，主要是缺水缺肥，针对这种情况，全县组织五万多人，开展了浇水、追肥运动，使三类苗得到正常的发育生长。吴桥县景州公社种在盐碱地上的小麦，因受盐碱侵害，成了三类苗，全社出动了社员五千六百人，制止了盐碱为害，麦苗已由黄变青，旺盛生长。	北京郊区：誓争亩产超千斤
    新华社14日讯　北京市郊区各人民公社正乘大好春光，采取具体措施，猛闯小麦返青关，誓争小麦亩产超千斤。
    北京郊区一百四十六万亩麦田正在返青。经过去年的深翻、密植、增施肥料，再加上一冬的精心管理，麦苗长得又密又匀，又齐又壮。据有关部门调查，平均每亩已有麦苗七十万株以上，增产更多的小麦大有希望。
    为了把丰产的可能性变为现实，郊区各地普遍进行了“八查”“五定”的工作：查深翻、查密植、查肥料、查水利、查品种、查分蘖、查病号、查管理，根据八查结果，定劳力、定产量、定措施、定地块、定领导。在“八查”“五定”工作中，各公社经过具体检查计算，按块定产，一般每亩平均产量都在千斤以上。干部、社员信心十足，正在紧张进行追肥、搂耙和浇水。通州区西集人民公社的十万亩小麦，去冬以来，已经普遍镇压、浇水、追肥各一次，目前正在进行第二次耙麦和追肥；永乐店公社的一百零五个土化肥厂已经制出了大量土化肥，平均每亩麦地已有一千八百多斤。为了让小麦喝足，大兴区安定、采育、黄村三个公社联合起来，整修了可容水六百多万方的青年水库，引蓄永定河水灌溉麦地。平谷县城关人民公社组织了打井专业队，在缺乏水源的地区突击打井二百一十眼，以实现麦地灌溉园田化。
    各公社为加强麦田管理，普遍建立了小麦管理专业战线，以环环扣紧、精益求精的精神，制定苦战一百二十天，过好返青保苗、拔节坐胎、抽穗扬花、灌浆攻籽、精打细收这五关的具体措施，保证肥、水不缺。并建立气象网、病虫情报网，严密注意防冻防霜、防治病虫害、防止倒伏，确保小麦丰收。	辽宁：打好春耕播种第一仗
    新华社沈阳14日电　辽宁农民在“粮帅升帐，小麦先行”的口号下，纷纷提早开犁播种春麦，力争打好春耕播种的第一仗。
    今年，春天提早来到了辽河两岸，沿岸辽中、台安、新民等主要春麦产区的小麦播种工作，普遍比去年提前了半月到一个月左右。
    辽宁农民一向认为小麦是低产作物，因此，不愿多种，也不精心侍弄。自从去年关内各省频传小麦高产捷报，再加上秋后各地深入地进行农业“八字宪法”的宣传教育，农民们的思想，有了很大变化，很多公社都计划积极扩种小麦和决心力争高产。预计今年全省小麦播种面积将比去年增加一倍以上。为了种好小麦，打响春耕播种第一炮，各地人民公社在备耕期间普遍依据农业“八字宪法”，制订了力争小麦高产的技术措施。台安县各人民公社并且组织社员开展了种好麦、夺高产、大闹技术革命的播种竞赛。因此今年各地的麦播质量比历年都好。大多数麦田都进行了深耕、平整和灌溉，做到了选播良种和实行密植，增施了底肥，改变了过去麦田不上粪的粗放现象。大面积高产麦田还普遍采用了园田化的耕种方法，力争突破亩产千斤大关，创造两千斤、三千斤、四千斤等高产纪录，为大秋作物树立高产榜样。	安徽：过好小麦拔节关
    新华社合肥14日电　安徽省近四千万亩麦田普遍生长良好。为了过好拔节关，力争穗大穗多，目前各地人民公社的社员们正在“一着不让，一步不松”、“粮食不到手，管理不放松”的口号下，更加深入细致地进行麦田管理工作。现在，全省参加麦田管理专业队的人数，已由原来的二百三十四万多人增加到三百八十二万多人。
    为了过好小麦拔节关，很多地区都提出了切实可行的田间管理措施。淮北砀山县的六十六万亩小麦，正在开始拔节。根据当地麦田生长情况，这个县采取了下列几方面的措施，加强麦田管理。一、看苗追肥。对生长特别好的高额丰产田，着重施磷钾肥，以利强秆和籽粒形成；一般丰产田既施磷钾肥也施氮肥；晚茬麦着重施氮肥、速效肥。并确定了每亩的施肥量。二、大抓灌溉。根据麦苗生长情况和地质情况的不同，分别灌溉不同的水量，促进强秆，防止倒伏。三、全面进行防霜、防冻、防倒伏、防病虫害。全县已经组织六百二十个天气预报预测小组；每块麦田地头，都挖了烟灶，为熏烟防霜防冻作好准备；为防治病虫害，全县准备了万斤千件的药械。四、锄草清底，促进小麦通风强秆。五、健全麦田档案制度，进一步开展技术研究活动。
    安徽省各地麦苗，目前除部分已起身拔节外，一般仍处在返青盛发期，少数的刚刚开始返青。为了对各种麦田分别加强管理，最近各地相继召开了加强各类麦苗田间管理工作的现场会议，及时交流先进经验，促使麦田管理工作越做越细致。（附图片）
