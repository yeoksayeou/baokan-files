    Female Factory Director Yaraui
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie

    Under the leadership of Yaraui Gecaine, the Gebani Textile Factory in Budapest has successively won the mobile red flag from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Ministers, and has received the title and rewards of advanced factory as many as fourteen times. Comrade Yaraui herself has also twice won the government medal of "For Socialist Labor" and the title of outstanding worker in light industry. We found Comrade Yaraui in the weaving workshop. She was helping a young female worker improve her working methods. From her skillful movements, it is clear that she is a labor expert.

    Yaraui began working as an apprentice in a factory at the age of fifteen, and she worked as a textile worker for more than twenty years. In Hungary, under the rule of Horthy, known as the "country of three million beggars," the lives of female workers were very miserable. At that time, they had to work twelve hours a day in the factory, and even time to eat was not given. The workers had to eat in secret, and if the foreman saw them, they would be beaten. Due to heavy and intense labor, many female workers often fell ill next to the machines. The average income of female workers was almost half that of male workers.

    In those cruel years, Yaraui also participated in the struggle to win the right to live and oppose the cruel exploitation of the capitalists. After the national liberation in 1945, Yaraui saw the dawn of a new life. She immediately participated in the struggle to build a new society. Before the nationalization of industrial enterprises in 1948, she served as the director of the factory committee in a private textile factory, and carried out resolute struggles to improve working conditions and the living welfare of employees, and to oppose the illegal activities of capitalists. She also joined the Communist Party. After the nationalization of industrial enterprises, this textile worker who had worked for more than twenty years was appointed as the factory director.

    Yaraui is not only a labor expert and an excellent factory leader, but also actively engages in social and political work. She is the chairman of the Women's Committee of the 10th District of Budapest, and she often cares about solving various issues related to the vital interests of women in the district. In addition, Yaraui is also a member of the presidium of the National Committee of the Red Cross, and she is currently carrying out work in the factory to help Algerian refugees. During the general election last year, all the employees of the factory unanimously nominated her as a candidate for the National Assembly, and she was enthusiastically supported by the voters and elected as a member of the National Assembly.

    女厂长雅劳伊
    本报记者　王崇杰
    布达佩斯盖巴尼纺织厂在雅劳伊·盖查奈的领导下，曾先后获得工会全国理事会和部长会议的流动红旗，并且得到先进厂的称号和奖励达十四次之多。雅劳伊同志本人也曾两次得到“为社会主义劳动”的政府奖章和轻工业优秀工作者的称号。我们在织布车间找到了雅劳伊同志。她正在帮助一个年青的女工改进工作方法。从她那熟练的动作，显然可以看出这是一位劳动的能手。
    雅劳伊从十五岁便开始到工厂当学徒，她一直作了二十多年纺织女工。在霍尔蒂统治下的号称“三百万乞丐的国度”的匈牙利，女工的生活是非常悲惨的。那时每天在工厂要工作十二小时，而且连吃饭的时间也不给。工人们只得偷空吃，工头看见了还要挨打。由于繁重紧张的劳动，很多女工常常病倒在机器旁边。女工的平均收入差不多比男工少一半。
    在那些残酷的年月里，雅劳伊也参加了争取生活权利反对资本家残酷剥削的斗争。1945年全国解放后，雅劳伊才看到了新生活的曙光。她立即参加了建设新社会的斗争。在1948年工业企业国有化以前，她在私营的纺织厂里担任了工厂委员会的主任，为改善劳动条件和职工的生活福利、反对资本家的非法活动进行了坚决的斗争。她并且参加了共产党。工业企业国有化以后，这位做了二十多年的纺织女工被任命为厂长。
    雅劳伊不仅是劳动的能手、优秀的工厂领导者，而且还积极从事社会政治工作。她是布达佩斯第十区妇女委员会的主席，她经常关心解决本区妇女切身利益的各种问题。此外，雅劳伊还是红十字会全国委员会主席团的委员，现在她正在厂里开展援助阿尔及利亚难民的工作。去年大选时，全厂职工一致提她为国会议员的候选人，并且得到选民们热烈的拥护，当选为国会议员。
