    Many Phoenixes in the Mountains of the South

    It has been researched and confirmed that the Kirin is actually the giraffe. This made me think of the Phoenix. There are also many legends about the Phoenix. Like the legends of the Dragon, Turtle, and Kirin, many of them were fabricated and exaggerated by the feudal rulers of ancient times to fool the common people. However, the folk belief in the existence of the Phoenix has some basis.
    The "Yunnan Mountain and River Records" says: "Phoenix Feather Mountain... formerly known as Mount Luofu, legend has it... that a Phoenix flew here, hence the name Phoenix Feather. Later, the Phoenix died, and every year in winter, many birds mourn on it, hence it is also called Bird Mourning. Even today, when the birds come, the locals light fires to catch them, and the birds rush to the fire to die." Bird Mourning Mountain is located southwest of Eryuan County in Yunnan Province, where more than 6,000 Bai people live. Every year in August and September of the lunar calendar, they go to the mountain in teams. When night falls, they first light a fire and sing and dance to their hearts' content. Soon, thousands upon thousands of birds of all kinds come in an earth-shattering manner. The large ones (Collared Scops Owl) are like small sheep, and the small ones (Zhitangzi bird) are like butterflies. Some fall on people's hats and clothes, while others rush into the fire. When they check the harvest the next morning, each person gets at least dozens or hundreds of them. However, if it is not a foggy and moonless night, it is in vain to light a fire. There is still no scientific explanation for this phenomenon, so it is no wonder that ancient people associated it with the legend of all birds paying homage to the Phoenix.
    There are also many legends about the economic value of the Phoenix. For example, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" records the "Phoenix Platform," which is said to be the white substance under the Phoenix's feet and has medical effects such as benefiting blood and calming the nerves. The "Langhuan Records" says that the Phoenix has hair under its neck that is as bright as gold and as soft as silk, which can be woven into golden brocade called "Phoenix Down Gold," which is best for keeping out the cold and has a beautiful fragrance. In addition, there is something called "Phoenix Cup," which is the Phoenix's beak; and something called "Widow's Resin," which is said to be made from the marrow of the Phoenix's bones and is very valuable. ... Although these cannot be fully believed, it is now very common to use the feathers, skin, meat, and bones of birds to make pillows, screens, medicines, and other supplies.
    It is said that the Phoenix's cry is very similar to the sound of a xiao (vertical bamboo flute), sheng (mouth organ), or like gold and drums. The Yuefu poem "Phoenix Song" writes: "Green Yao grams of Bi Tong guan sheng, Zhu lips and jade fingers learn the Phoenix's cry." The book "Customs" clearly points out that the xiao and sheng were created in imitation of the Phoenix's cry.
    The above words seem to have acknowledged the real existence of the Phoenix. But why has no one seen a Phoenix now? There are two explanations for this question:
    One explanation is: The Phoenix was a kind of pheasant-like bird that lived in ancient times. Later, it became extinct midway, resulting in incomplete records and causing many misunderstandings. Judging from ancient records, the Phoenix was very large and may have had abnormal development, which was very unfavorable for survival. As humans gradually evolved, primitive forests were continuously cut down, which would have had a negative impact on the Phoenix's search for food and shelter.
    The other is: The Phoenix was actually a pheasant beautified and deified by the ancients. The pheasant is also called the mountain chicken because it is very similar to the chicken; there are many in the south. The book "Huainanzi" says that the Phoenix's alias is "Tiji" (cuckoo), and some ancient books say that it is also called "Jiqu", or use "chicken beak" and "chicken head" to describe its beak and head; this shows that the Phoenix is also like a chicken. Du Fu's "Zhu Feng Xing" and "Compendium of Materia Medica" and many other books say that the Phoenix is produced in the south. In the high mountains of Yichang, Hubei, it is said that there are pheasants that are six or seven feet long, which can be consistent with the "Erya Yishu" saying that "the Phoenix is eight feet tall" and Jin Guo Pu saying that "the Phoenix bird is five or six feet tall." Someone once investigated the Yichang area and described the pheasant's flying posture as: "Watching it spread its wings and soar, like several strange kites, dancing in the clouds." This is extremely similar to Song Yu's question to the King of Chu: "The Phoenix strikes nine thousand miles upward, carries the blue sky, and its feet disturb the floating clouds" ("Strategies of the Warring States"). Moreover, the colorfulness of the pheasant is more than enough to be described by the best rhetoric in ancient poems describing the beauty of the Phoenix.
    Li Bai wrote in his poem: "The people of Chu do not know the Phoenix, they buy mountain chickens at a high price." Although the people of Chu do not know the Phoenix, the average person obviously does not know the Phoenix either. The one who truly knows the Phoenix should be the hunter who sells mountain chickens; because he refers to the mountain chicken as the Phoenix, which is in line with our deduction.

    南国山中多凤凰
    杨旻
    麒麟就是长颈鹿，已经有人作了考证了。由此我想到了凤凰。凤凰的传说也很多。和龙、龟、麟的传说一样，其中有不少是古代的封建统治者渲染臆造，愚弄百姓的。但是民间确信有凤凰存在，是有一定根据的。
    云南山川志说：“凤羽山……旧名罗浮山，相传……有凤翔于此，故名凤羽。后凤死，每岁冬众鸟哀吊其上，故又名鸟吊。至今土人于鸟来时举火取之，鸟见火辄赴火自死。”按鸟吊山在今云南洱源县城西南，附近居住着白族人民六千多户。每到农历8、9月，他们便结队上山。当夜幕降临时，先是举火、尽情歌舞，不久，千千万万、形形色色的鸟类，便惊天动地而来。大的（领腰鸟）赛小羊，小的（直聘子鸟）如蝴蝶。有的落人衣帽，有的则赴汤蹈火。翌晨检点收获，每人至少也得弄个数十只或百来只。不过如果不是多雾和无月的夜晚，纵举火也枉然。这现象到现在还没有科学的解释，无怪乎古代人们要联想到百鸟朝凤的说法。
    传说中还有很多谈到凤凰的经济价值。例如“本草纲目”上所载的“凤凰台”，据说是凤凰脚下的白色物，有利血、安神等医疗效果。“琅嬛记”一书则说凤凰颈下有毛，光明如金，细软如丝，织为金锦，叫做“凤毛金”，最能御寒，且有幽美的香气。此外，有叫“凤凰杯”的，是凤凰的嘴；有名“续弦胶”的，据说是凤凰的骨髓熬炼而成，都很贵重。……这些虽不可尽信，但现在利用鸟类的羽毛、皮、肉、骨等来制造枕垫、屏幛、医药以及其他用品，已非常普通。
    据说凤凰的鸣声，很像箫、笙，或似金、鼓。乐府“凤凰曲”写道：“绿耀克碧彤琯笙，朱唇玉指学凤鸣”。“风俗通”一书则明白地指出箫笙是模仿凤凰的鸣声创制出来的。
    上面这些话，似乎已承认了凤凰的真实存在。但是为什么现在谁也没有见过凤凰呢？关于这问题，有两种解说：
    一说是：凤凰是远古时候生存过的一种属于雉类的鸟类。后来中途灭绝了，以致记载不详，引起人们发生许多误解。从古代的记载来看，凤凰的形体是很大的，还可能有畸形的发育，这对于生存都非常不利。人类逐渐进化，原始林木便随着不断被砍伐，这对于凤凰的求食和栖止，也会产生不良的影响。
    另一种是：凤凰实在是古人将雉鸟美化、神化而成。雉又叫山鸡，因为它和鸡非常相似；南方很多。“淮南子”一书则说凤凰别名“鷤鸡”，有些古籍说它又叫“鸡趣”，或用“鸡喙”、“鸡头”来形容它的喙和头；这说明了凤凰也是像鸡的。杜甫的“朱凤行”和“本草纲目”等许多书又都说凤凰是南方所产。湖北宜昌一带的高山上，据说有六、七尺长的山鸡，这和“尔雅义疏”所说的“凤凰高八尺”以及晋郭璞所说的“凤鸟高五、六尺”，都能符合。从前有人曾到宜昌一带考察过，他描写山鸡的飞翔姿态说：“看它展翅高翔，宛如几只奇异的纸鸢，凌云而舞”这和宋玉的对楚王问：“凤凰上击九千里，负苍天，足乱浮云”（战国策），极其相像。何况山鸡的五彩缤纷，就是用古代诗词中描写凤凰的美丽的最好词藻来形容，也一点不算为过。
    李白诗云：“楚人不识凤，重价买山鸡”。楚人虽不识凤，但一般人也显然不识凤。真正识凤的，应该算那卖山鸡的猎者；因为他指山鸡为凤，正合乎我们的推断。
