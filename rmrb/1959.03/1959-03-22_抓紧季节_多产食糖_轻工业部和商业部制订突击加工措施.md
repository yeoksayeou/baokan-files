Seize the Season, Produce More Sugar
Ministry of Light Industry and Ministry of Commerce Formulate Measures for Intensive Processing

(Our report) Seizing the current sugar extraction season and processing all sugar crops is the most urgent task for the sugar industry at present. To accomplish this task, the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Commerce recently convened meetings in Taiyuan, Guangzhou, and Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan, to study and formulate a series of measures to process existing sugar materials in a short period.

Last year, the country had a bumper harvest of sugar crops. Besides processing a portion in the fourth quarter of last year, a large amount of sugar material needs to be processed in the first half of this year. The sugar material processing task for the first half of this year is more than 80% higher than the same period last year. However, sugar production is highly seasonal. The sugar extraction period is only five or six months each year. Sugarcane sugar production should generally be completed before mid-April. Delaying the time will reduce the sugar extraction rate and cause some sugar material to be lost. To this end, representatives from key sugar-producing areas and sugar factories attending the meeting put forward the slogan "Guarantee that not a single plant rots, not a single stalk is lost, every plant and every stalk produces sugar, fight for 45 days, and strive to overfulfill the sugar production plan for the first half of the year." They also decided that under the favorable conditions where the State Council has already made arrangements for issues related to transportation, coal supply, and so on in the current sugar production, the following tasks should be done well:

1.  Actively do a good job in the transfer, transportation, and storage of sugar materials. Under the leadership of the Party committee, we must first solve the problem of labor and transportation capacity for transferring sugar materials, retrieve the sugar beets left in the fields that have not been harvested and the excess mother roots for seed, and send them to the sugar factories for processing. Sugarcane should be cut, transported, and processed as soon as possible. For sugar materials scattered in various places that small factories cannot process, they can be concentrated and sent to large factories for processing. For factories with equipment capacity but no sugar material, or factories with sugar material but insufficient processing capacity, we must promote the spirit of cooperation and do a good job in balanced allocation. Special attention should be paid to the storage of sugar beets, and the transfer of good sugar materials for other uses (such as winemaking) should be prevented.

2.  Strive to improve the processing capacity of existing sugar factories and expand the processing volume. For example, sugar factories in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have adopted many technical measures to increase the processing capacity of existing equipment by 50%-70%, greatly increasing output. Small sugar factories should mobilize sufficient labor and earnestly carry out technical transformation.

3.  Strive to reduce the total loss of sugar and increase the sugar extraction rate. The total sugar loss of mechanized sugar beet factories should not exceed 3.5%; each small sugar beet factory should produce 1.2 jin more sugar per 100 jin of sugar material. The recovery rate of mechanized sugarcane sugar should not be less than 86% to 89%, and the sugar extraction rate of indigenous sugar should reach at least 11%.

4.  Increase the variety of sugar. Grade 2 and 3 sugar from mechanized sugar production should be released as finished products. Small sugar factories with the conditions should produce some white sugar, and general small sugar factories should produce a wide variety of sliced sugar, sugar bricks, sugar powder, and honey cakes.

5.  Packaging materials for sugar production should be solved by the industrial and commercial sectors in coordination, through measures such as economical use, recycling, and self-production.

6.  Sugar is a product that the state purchases uniformly. The commercial departments guarantee timely purchase and allocation to meet market needs.

### 抓紧季节　多产食糖  轻工业部和商业部制订突击加工措施

    抓紧季节　多产食糖
    轻工业部和商业部制订突击加工措施
    本报讯　抓紧当前榨糖季节，把所有糖料作物都加工出来，这是目前制糖工业最紧迫的任务。为完成这项任务，轻工业部和商业部最近先后在太原、广州和四川内江专区召开会议，研究和制订了在短时期内加工完现有糖料的一系列措施。
    去年全国糖料作物丰收，除了去年第四季度加工一部分之外，还有大量糖料要在今年上半年加工，今年上半年的糖料加工任务就比去年同期增加80％以上。但是食糖生产的季节性很强，每年的榨糖期只有五、六个月，甘蔗制糖一般应在4月半以前加工完毕，如果推迟了时间，就会使糖料的出糖率降低，并且使一部分糖料受到损失。为此，参加会议的各个重点产糖区和糖厂的代表，提出了“保证一棵不烂、一根不丢，棵棵根根都出糖，奋战四十五天，力争上半年超额完成食糖生产计划”的行动口号，并且决定在国务院已经对当前食糖生产中有关运输工具、煤炭供应等问题作了安排的有利条件下，作好以下几件工作：
    一，积极做好糖料的调运、保管工作。在党委的领导下首先要解决调运糖料的劳动力和运力问题，把遗留在地里没有收上来的甜菜和留种多余的母根，都加以收回送到糖厂加工；甘蔗要随砍、随运、随加工；对于散存各地而小厂又加工不了的糖料，可集中送大厂加工；对于有设备能力但是没有糖料，或者有糖料而加工能力不足的工厂，要发扬协作精神作好平衡调拨；要特别注意做好甜菜的保管工作，并且要制止把好糖料移作他用（如造酒等）。
    二，努力提高现有糖厂的加工能力，扩大处理量。如黑龙江、吉林两省的糖厂采取许多技术措施，使现有设备的加工能力提高了50％—70％，产量大大提高。小糖厂要调足劳力，认真进行技术改造。
    三，力求降低糖份总损失，提高出糖率。要做到甜菜机制糖厂糖份总损失不超过3.5％；每个小甜菜糖厂每百斤糖料要多出一点二斤糖。机制甘蔗糖的回收率要不低于86％到89％，土糖的出糖率至少要达到11％。
    四，增加糖的品种。机制糖的二、三号糖要作为成品出厂。有条件的小糖厂要生产部分白糖，一般小糖厂要生产多种多样的片糖、糖砖、糖粉、带蜜糖糕等。
  五，制糖生产用的包装材料，要采取节约使用、回收再用、自行生产等办法，由工业、商业两方面协同解决。
    六，食糖为国家统一收购的产品。商业部门保证及时做好收购、调拨工作，以供应市场需要。
