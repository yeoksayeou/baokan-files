Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 6th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in response to questions at a meeting of the Senate Budget Committee on the 4th, declared that he refuses to pursue the neutral policy strongly demanded by the Japanese public. He also stated that he believes "continuing to maintain Japan-U.S. joint defense is a realistic approach."

Kishi's response on the 4th to questions from Socialist Party member Hanyu Sanae once again demonstrated that he is wholeheartedly determined to tie Japan to the U.S. war machine by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

When questioning Kishi Nobusuke about revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Hanyu Sanae pointed out that providing military bases to the U.S. military by Japan will endanger Japan's security. He said that the "experimental" plan for revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke government stipulates that "when U.S. forces stationed in Japan are attacked, this attack will be regarded as an attack on Japan, and Japan will take necessary actions in response." He said that if the United States is at war with a third country, U.S. military bases in Japan will be attacked, and Japan will be dragged into the war, which is the greatest threat to Japan and is not commensurate with guaranteeing Japan's security. He questioned how the Kishi Nobusuke government views this issue.

In response to Hanyu's question, Kishi Nobusuke brazenly stated that Japan must take joint war actions with the United States when the United States uses its troops and bases in Japan to launch aggression. He said, "If there is an attack on U.S. military bases, I believe that regardless of whether it is justified or unjustified, it is naturally an attack on Japanese territory, Japanese airspace, and other inherent rights possessed by Japan. Needless to say, this is aggression against Japan." He said that in this case, Japan will "cooperate with friendly countries."

Hanyu pointed out that providing military bases to the United States by Japan will make Japan participate in the "joint defense" system of the United States. This violates the Japanese Constitution. Hanyu questioned whether Kishi Nobusuke wanted to revise Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution regarding Japan not being allowed to possess war potential.

In his response, Kishi Nobusuke deliberately obfuscated the issue, attempting to cover up Japan's expansionist ambitions with the claim that Japan can possess "the right of self-defense." He clamored that Japan must possess the "strength" to guarantee the "right of self-defense," and he did not hide his intention to revise the Japanese Constitution, saying that it is necessary to make the Japanese Constitution "explicitly" state that Japan possesses his so-called "right of self-defense."

Kishi Nobusuke's "Defense Agency" Director General Ino Shigeru, in response to Hanyu's questions, also stated that Japan wants to accelerate the expansion of its military and "rapidly develop weapons." He also admitted that Kishi Nobusuke believes that "limitedly transporting nuclear weapons does not count as a violation of the Constitution."

### 岸信介死心塌地当美国帮凶  硬要修改日美“安全条约”

    岸信介死心塌地当美国帮凶
    硬要修改日美“安全条约”
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介4日在参议院预算委员会会议上答复质询时，宣称他拒绝奉行日本公众强烈要求采取的中立政策，并且表示，他认为“继续维持日美共同防御是一个现实的办法。”
    岸信介4日对社会党议员羽生三七的质询的答复再次表明，他死心塌地地要通过修改日美“安全条约”，把日本拴在美国的战车上。
    羽生三七在就修改日美“安全条约”问题提出质询时指出，日本向美军提供军事基地，将危害日本的安全。他说，岸信介政府提出的修改日美“安全条约”的“试验性”方案规定，“在驻日美军受到攻击的时候，这种攻击就将被看成是对日本的进攻，日本将就此采取必要的行动。”他说，假如美国和第三国处于战争状态，在日本的美军基地就会受到攻击，日本就将被卷入战火，这是对日本的最大威胁，是同保障日本安全不相称的。他质问岸信介政府怎样看待这个问题。
    岸信介在答复羽生的问题时，悍然表示日本在美国利用它在日本的驻军和基地发动侵略时，要同美国共同采取战争行动。他说，“如果对美军基地进攻，我认为不管有理或者无理，自然就是对日本领土、日本领空以及其他日本拥有的当然的权利的进攻，不消说，这是对日本的侵略”。他说，在这种情况下，日本就要“同友好国家进行合作”。
    羽生指出，日本向美国提供军事基地，就将使日本参加到美国的“共同防御”体系中。这是违反日本宪法的。羽生质问岸信介是不是要修改日本宪法第九条关于日本不得拥有战争潜力的规定。
    岸信介在答复时故意混淆视听，企图以日本可以拥有“自卫权”的说法来掩饰日本的扩张野心。他叫嚷日本必须拥有保证“自卫权”的“实力”，并且毫不掩饰他要修改日本宪法的企图说，必须使日本宪法“明确”日本拥有他所谓的“自卫权”。
    岸信介的“防卫厅”长官伊能繁次郎在答复羽生的质询时，也表示日本要加速扩充军备和“迅速发展武器”。他还承认，岸信介认为“有限制地运进核武器并不算是违反宪法”。
