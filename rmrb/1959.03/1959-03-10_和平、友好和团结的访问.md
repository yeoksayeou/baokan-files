    A Visit of Peace, Friendship and Solidarity
    President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently paid a ten-day friendly visit to the Republic of Indonesia at the invitation of the Indonesian government. During the visit, President Ho Chi Minh received a grand and warm welcome from Indonesian national leaders, government officials, and the people, fully demonstrating the profound friendship between the governments and peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia. President Ho Chi Minh and President Sukarno held sincere talks and issued a joint communiqué, further strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and Indonesia, thereby making a positive contribution to the cause of promoting peace, friendship, and solidarity in Asia and Africa.
    Both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Indonesia are participants in the historic Bandung Conference and upholders of the Bandung Principles. The most important content of the Bandung Spirit is to oppose colonial aggression, maintain peace and friendly solidarity between Asian and African countries, and promote peaceful coexistence. The joint communiqué issued by President Ho Chi Minh and President Sukarno implemented and promoted these principles of the Bandung Conference. The joint communiqué emphasized that both countries support the struggle of all colonial peoples for independence. The two Asian leaders jointly believe that the various consequences of colonial rule and exploitation of the people will endanger world peace. Colonialism and imperialism must be eliminated, regardless of the reasons given or the forms and manifestations they take. This is a powerful support for the rising national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a heavy blow to imperialists and colonialists. The joint communiqué mentioned that President Ho Chi Minh, in his talks during his visit to Indonesia, emphasized that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly support the Indonesian people's struggle for West Irian to return to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. The joint communiqué also clearly pointed out that the reunification of Vietnam should be resolved using the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords. This is a major support from the Indonesian people for the Vietnamese people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their homeland. In the joint communiqué, President Ho Chi Minh and President Sukarno also believed that efforts should be intensified to achieve disarmament, prohibit the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, and condemned the policy of establishing military blocs. The consensus of opinion between the leaders of Vietnam and Indonesia on current major international issues, their mutual support in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and their joint efforts in strengthening solidarity and cooperation between the two countries and promoting peaceful coexistence, have set a great example for the people of Asian and African countries.
    Although Vietnam and Indonesia are countries with different social systems, this does not hinder the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries in the slightest. The people of both countries have suffered from the long-term rule of Western colonialism and have a glorious historical tradition of opposing imperialism and colonialism. After the Second World War, the Vietnamese people, through continuous struggle and efforts, gained liberation and began socialist construction, while Indonesia embarked on the road to independence. However, the struggle of both countries against imperialism is not yet over. Now, the people of both countries are engaged in peaceful construction, striving for economic independence and prosperity. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has victoriously completed the historical task of land reform and is now marching towards the broad road of socialist industrialization; after suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion supported by imperialists, the Indonesian government is striving for further independent development of the national economy. Therefore, it is natural that the people of both countries urgently demand peace and resolutely oppose war and the imperialist military bloc policy.
    Western imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists, are very afraid of the strengthening of solidarity and friendship between Asian and African countries. They have always tried every possible means to undermine the solidarity and cooperation between Asian and African countries. During President Ho Chi Minh's visit to Indonesia, the US propaganda machine tried its best to sow discord. United Press International even said: "Ho Chi Minh's visit is of no significance because 'the two countries have nothing in common'." Their intentions are very obvious.
    At present, U.S. imperialism is carrying out new aggressive conspiracies in the Southeast Asian region, attempting to tear up the Geneva Accords, invade Indochina, and undermine peace in the Southeast Asian region. Recently, provocative military exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization were also conducted in Bangkok. At a press conference in Jakarta, President Ho Chi Minh solemnly pointed out: Imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries has increased; the Vietnamese people strongly oppose the imperialist Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, which openly interferes in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and carries out subversive activities in order to establish militarist regimes, undermine the independence and peace of Southeast Asian countries, and prepare for a new war. Under this situation, strengthening the unity among Southeast Asian countries, among Asian and African countries, and their common struggle against imperialism and colonialism is of particular significance.
    The Chinese people are very pleased with the results achieved by the meeting between the leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Indonesia. We believe that the Bandung Principles will continue to be promoted, and the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of Asian and African countries will continue to be strengthened.

### 和平、友好和团结的访问

    和平、友好和团结的访问
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席最近应邀到印度尼西亚共和国进行了为期十天的友好访问。在访问期间，胡志明主席受到印度尼西亚国家领导人、政府人士和人民的隆重而热烈的欢迎，充分地表现了越南和印度尼西亚两国政府和人民之间的深厚友谊。胡志明主席和苏加诺总统举行了诚挚的会谈，发表了联合公报，进一步加强了越南和印度尼西亚之间的友好合作关系，从而对增进亚非地区和平、友好和团结的事业作出了良好的贡献。
    越南民主共和国和印度尼西亚共和国同是历史性的万隆会议的参加者和万隆原则的维护者。万隆精神的最重要的内容，是反对殖民主义侵略，维护和平和亚非国家之间友好团结，和平共处。胡志明主席和苏加诺总统所发表的联合公报，贯彻和发扬了万隆会议的这些原则。联合公报强调指出，两国支持所有殖民地人民争取独立的斗争。这两位亚洲国家的领袖共同认为，对人民进行殖民统治和压榨的种种后果，将危及世界和平。殖民主义和帝国主义必须加以消灭，不管提出了什么理由，也不管采取的形式和表现如何。这对于亚非地区和拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族解放运动是一个有力的支持，而对帝国主义者和殖民主义者则是一个沉重的打击。联合公报提到，胡志明主席在访问印度尼西亚时的各次谈话中，都强调表示，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民，坚决支持印度尼西亚人民为西伊里安回到印度尼西亚共和国的版图而进行的斗争。联合公报也明确指出，越南的重新统一问题，应当运用1954年日内瓦协议的条款来解决。这是印度尼西亚人民对越南人民要求和平统一自己祖国的愿望的重大支持。胡志明主席和苏加诺总统在联合公报中还认为，应该加紧努力来实现裁减军备，禁止生产、试验和使用核武器和热核武器，并谴责了建立军事集团的政策。越南和印度尼西亚两国领导人在当前国际重大问题上的意见一致，在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中的互相支持，以及在加强两国之间的团结合作和促进和平共处问题上的共同努力，为亚非各国人民作出了伟大的榜样。
    越南和印度尼西亚尽管是社会制度不同的国家，丝毫也不妨碍两国之间的友好联系和合作。两国人民曾经同样地遭受了西方殖民主义的长期统治，并且都有着反对帝国主义和殖民主义的光辉的历史传统。第二次世界大战以后，越南人民经过不断的斗争和努力，获得了解放，开始了社会主义的建设，而印度尼西亚也走上了独立的道路。但是，两国反对帝国主义的斗争，都还没有结束。现在，两国人民都在进行和平建设，争取经济生活的独立和繁荣。越南民主共和国已经胜利地完成了土地改革的历史任务，现正向着社会主义工业化的康庄大道迈进；印度尼西亚政府在镇压了帝国主义者所支持的反革命叛乱以后，正争取国民经济进一步的独立发展。因此，两国人民都迫切地要求和平，坚决反对战争和帝国主义军事集团政策，这是很自然的。
    西方帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者，十分害怕亚非国家之间团结友好关系的加强。它们一向千方百计地企图破坏亚非各国之间的团结合作。胡志明主席这次访问印度尼西亚，美国宣传机关就曾竭尽挑拨的能事。合众国际社甚至说：“胡志明的访问没有什么重要意义，因为‘两国没有什么共同之处’”。其用心是十分明显的。
    目前，美帝国主义正在对东南亚地区进行新的侵略阴谋活动，力图撕毁日内瓦协议，侵略印度支那，破坏东南亚地区的和平。最近在曼谷还进行了东南亚集团的挑衅性的军事演习。胡志明主席在雅加达记者招待会上严正地指出：帝国主义干涉东南亚国家内政的活动有所增加；越南人民强烈反对帝国主义者的东南亚条约组织集团，他们公开干涉东南亚国家的内政和进行颠复活动，以便建立军国主义的政权，破坏东南亚国家的独立与和平，并且准备新的战争。在这种形势下，加强东南亚国家之间、亚非国家之间的团结和它们反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争，更具有特别重大的意义。
    中国人民对越南民主共和国和印度尼西亚共和国两国领导人会见所获得的成就感到十分高兴。我们相信，万隆原则将继续发扬，亚非各国人民之间的友好合作关系将不断增强。
