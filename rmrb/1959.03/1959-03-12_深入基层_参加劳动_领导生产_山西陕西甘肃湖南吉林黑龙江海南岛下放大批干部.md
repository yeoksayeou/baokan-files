    Going Deep into the Grassroots, Participating in Labor, Leading Production
    Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Hainan Island Send Large Numbers of Cadres to Lower Levels
    Shanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th: More than 10,000 cadres in Shanxi Province who are to be sent to lower levels for a year of labor training this year, and the first batch of cadres who will be sent down for short periods as commune members and workers, have successively departed for the countryside and factories.
    Before the cadres were sent down, all levels of organizations organized airing of views and debates. Many cadres vied to request to be sent down in the airing of views. Leading cadres at all levels also requested to be sent down to communes and factories to be commune members or workers for a period of time. Among the 3,000 cadres sent down in the Jin Southeast region, there were Zhao Jun, the First Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, Guo Shusen, Secretary of the Secretariat, Shi Pizhen, Deputy Commissioner, and more than ten ministers of the Prefectural Committee and various departments, as well as 258 leading cadres above the level of county committee minister. They went to people's communes in nine counties to be commune members. Among the more than 2,000 cadres sent down this time in the Jin South region, there were more than 100 leading cadres at the county level and above. Every county had county party secretaries and county committee members sent down. Leading cadres such as Shen Jie, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, Zhao Zhenhua, Standing Committee Member of the Prefectural Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, and Shi Min, Deputy Commissioner, also went with more than 100 cadres from directly subordinate organizations to people's communes and factories in Linfen, Yuncheng, and other places to be commune members or workers for one to three months. The first batch of more than 1,600 cadres from twelve counties and cities in the Jin North region were sent down to communes and factories to work, and another 2,000 cadres were sent down for a year of labor training. At the same time, more than 200 cadres above the county level were transferred to various people's communes to strengthen leadership.
    All levels of party committees require all cadres sent down to achieve "four haves" (have a labor handbook, labor tools, experimental fields, and work focus). The Linfen County Committee of the Communist Party of China requires each cadre sent down to achieve six goods: good at in-depth work and completing tasks, good at promoting democratic mass line working methods, good at ideological progress and hard work, good at caring for the lives of the masses and helping the masses solve difficulties, good at obeying leadership organizational discipline, and good at running experimental fields.
    After leading cadres at all levels were sent down to communes, management areas, and production teams, they ate, lived, and worked with the masses, actively participated in production, went deep into reality, conducted investigations and research, and discovered and solved problems at any time, promoting the production and work of the commune. After Guan Yi, the First Secretary of the Zuo Yun County Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to the Dongfeng Commune, he actively worked with the commune members. The commune members generally praised him and said: "Chairman Mao loves the people and sends cadres to the countryside. Cadres and commune members are one family, and we will work together to grasp production. We will work harder together. A thousand catties per mu is nothing."
    Shaanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th: Recently, a large number of cadres from leading organizations at all levels in Shaanxi Province have been sent down to people's communes to be commune members for a period of time. According to preliminary statistics from eleven counties and cities, including Chang'an, Lintong, and Zhouzhi, as of the 6th, 1,163 cadres have been sent down to people's communes as commune members, including many leading cadres such as county party secretaries, county heads, and ministers. In addition, 84 county party secretaries and county heads have been sent down to take charge of the leadership work of the communes.
    The work of sending cadres from provincial-level organizations in Shaanxi Province is being carried out enthusiastically. The walls of many organizations are plastered with applications and letters of determination from cadres requesting to be sent down. It is estimated that more than 600 cadres from provincial-level organizations will be sent down to people's communes as commune members, including more than 100 cadres at the level of department and bureau chiefs and section and division chiefs. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League has also decided to send down more than 800 cadres from the provincial committee organizations to be commune members.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this work of sending cadres down. As early as mid-February, it issued a special notice. The Organization Department of the Provincial Committee recently held an on-site meeting in Lintong County to exchange experiences in the work of sending cadres down and to visit the cadres' participation in labor.
    Last year, Shaanxi Province sent down more than 35,000 cadres, and they have achieved great success in learning knowledge of production struggle, transforming their thinking, and spreading cultural and technical knowledge.
    Gansu
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 10th: More than 100,000 cadres in Gansu Province will participate in labor training in various ways this year. At present, more than 5,200 cadres have been sent down to the countryside as commune members, and a large number of cadres are preparing to be sent down successively to participate in agricultural production.
    Most of the cadres who have been sent down as commune members are at the level of provincial section chiefs and county-level cadres. Some of them will be sent down for a year, and some will go to the countryside to work for one to several months. Some of them work in the production teams of the communes, engage in experimental fields and small-area high-yield fields, and some go to the communes to serve as cooks, feeders, administrators, and nursery workers.
    After these cadres become commune members, they can all appear as ordinary laborers, working diligently, eating, living, and working with the masses. Not only can they quickly strengthen their labor views and improve their ideological awareness, but they also more closely connect with the masses, which has played a certain role in production and grassroots work. Li Gui, Secretary of the Wushan County Committee of the Communist Youth League, became a member of the Dongshun Youth Commando Team after being sent down to the Yongmen Commune. In order to ensure the high-yield target of 500 mu of wheat, he put forward six new measures. Huang Jiasheng, Secretary of the General Branch of the Weiqi Commune in Shandan County, has been sent down as a commune member for more than a month. In the manure accumulation campaign, he and the commune members launched a labor competition, which effectively promoted the manure accumulation work. In Yongchang County and Shandan County, a total of 394 commune party committee secretaries, production team party branch secretaries, and production team leaders were sent down to be cooks, feeders, nursery workers, and administrators, and the masses were very satisfied.
    Participation in physical labor has formed a trend among the vast number of cadres in Gansu Province. In addition to sending down cadres, 45,000 cadres at all levels who went to the countryside to help people's communes rectify the communes participated in the production labor of the communes. Since last winter, rural grassroots cadres have spent more than one-third of their time working in the fields with farmers.
    Hunan
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: This year, Hunan Province, prefectures, and counties have sent down more than 22,000 cadres to factories and rural areas to conduct labor training and strengthen the leadership of the grassroots. People's communes in various places have also sent down a large number of cadres to grassroots units to participate in production and lead production.
    Among the cadres who have been sent down, there are five members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and members, eighteen prefecture committee secretaries, provincial department and bureau directors, and 179 provincial agency section chiefs, prefecture committee ministers, and county party secretaries. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has successively transferred 5,000 cadres to communes to be commune members, including Zhang Ying, Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture, Chen Yanbin, Member of the Prefectural Party Committee and Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, and others.
    Cadres sent down to the countryside in various places all labor and live with the masses as ordinary laborers. Dong Xuelin, Secretary-General of the Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, was sent down to the Chetou People's Commune in Daoxian County. In the manure accumulation campaign, he often went out to pick up dog dung at dawn, sometimes picking up more than 100 catties, which had a good impact on the masses. Luo Mingcai, Secretary of the Zhaoshi Commune Party Committee in Longshan County, created a kind of manure-carrying boat with the masses after being sent down to the production team, increasing work efficiency by more than five times. Some relatively backward communes and production teams have made a lot of progress with the help of the sent-down cadres and the efforts of the cadres and commune members. More than 350 production teams in Shuangfeng County and Shaoyang County have become advanced teams after the leadership of the sent-down cadres was strengthened. Lu Jiuxing, Deputy Secretary of the Ningyuan County Party Committee, went to the commune and worked and produced with the commune members, driving the cadres of the whole commune to lead production by participating in production, solving some problems in production, and significantly improving the commune work in the county.
    Jilin
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 11th: Leading organizations at all levels in Jilin Province continue to transfer cadres to lower levels for labor training and to strengthen the leadership of the grassroots.
    Jilin Province has adopted a variety of forms to send down cadres this year. The first batch of 90 section-level and division-level leading cadres from provincial-level organizations went to six regions in the province for a longer period of time to participate in grassroots work and labor training. The Party Group of the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture recently decided that from March to October, leading cadres and technical cadres above the level of section chief and agricultural technician in the department who can participate in physical labor will be sent to people's communes to be commune members in five batches in rotation. Among them, the first batch of eight cadres sent down, led by Deputy Director Tian Qing, went to people's communes to participate in labor. The first batch of 31 cadres from the Provincial Party Committee went to the steel plant and machinery factory run by the Provincial Party Committee to work. Pan Shi, Huaide, Lishu, Yongji and other four counties recently transferred more than 40 leading cadres above the level of county committee member to serve as party committee secretaries or presidents of people's communes. Daan, Yushu, Linjiang, Changling and other counties have also made plans to send county-level and above leading cadres to people's communes in batches for more than two months this year to be commune members.
    The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently required that leading cadres who take turns going to the grassroots to serve as leaders and participate in labor should be combined with the base points established by the leading organizations; leading cadres engaging in experimental fields should adopt a method that combines cadres and the masses. The Provincial Party Committee stipulates that the performance of all aspects during the period of being sent down should be regarded as an important situation for examining and understanding cadres.
    Heilongjiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 11th: The first batch of cadres sent down this year in Heilongjiang Province have already had a good start in closely contacting the masses, leading the masses, and engaging in production with the masses.
    More than 1,300 cadres in the province have been sent down to the countryside and factories this year. Although they have not been at the grassroots level for a long time, they have already had a good start in closely contacting the masses and driving the masses to engage in production. Liu Ying, a judge of the Suihua County People's Court, was sent down to the Xinhua People's Commune as a commune member. Seeing that there were not enough manure delivery tools, he studied and reformed and created manure delivery tools with the masses, which increased the efficiency of manure delivery tenfold. The leading cadres of the Harbin Meat United Processing Plant took turns leaving their posts to work in the workshops, which played a good role in improving some weak links in the factory. Xu Yankai, the director of the factory, went to the non-staple food workshop to work as a worker. After learning that some workers in this workshop did not strictly implement the operating procedures, which affected the quality of the products, he took the lead in strictly implementing the operating procedures and put forward many improvement measures, which improved the production situation in this workshop. Liu Hongxiang, the deputy secretary of the factory's party committee, went to the canteen as a cook. After helping the canteen establish some work systems and improving the canteen work, he basically eliminated the phenomenon of queuing for meals, which greatly improved the canteen work.
    Hainan Island
    This newspaper reports: On Hainan Island, 4,420 county-level agency cadres and commune-level cadres who are divorced from production have been sent down to communes as commune members or to grassroots units to take charge of leadership work.
    Most of these cadres are sent down to be commune members or workers in rotation, directly participating in production, and the time is generally about three months to half a year; in addition, some are sent down to communes, management areas, and production teams to take charge of leadership work, strengthen the forefront of agricultural production, and further train themselves. In Dongfang County, a total of 635 county and commune cadres have been sent down; among the 66 management areas in the county, the general party branch secretaries or directors of 55 management areas are county party committee ministers, commune party committee secretaries, and presidents who have been sent down.

    山西
    新华社太原11日电　山西省本年度下放劳动锻炼一年的一万多名干部和第一批短期下放当社员、工人的干部，已经陆续出发到农村和工厂。
    各级机关在干部下放之前，都组织了鸣放辩论，许多干部在鸣放中争先恐后地要求下放。各级机关领导干部也纷纷要求下放到公社、工厂当一个时期的社员或工人。晋东南地区下放的三千名干部中，有地委第一书记赵军、书记处书记郭树森、副专员师丕珍以及地委、各部部长十多人，县委部长级以上领导干部二百五十八人，他们分别到九个县的人民公社当社员。晋南地区这次下放的两千多名干部中，县级以上领导干部有一百多人，各县都有县委书记和县委委员下放。地委书记申杰、地委常委兼组织部长赵振华、副专员石珉等领导干部，也和直属机关一百多干部分别到临汾、运城等地的人民公社和厂矿，去当一个月到三个月的社员或工人。晋北地区十二个县、市第一批下放一千六百多名干部到公社、工厂劳动，另有二千名干部下放劳动锻炼一年，同时还抽调了二百多名县级以上干部到各人民公社加强领导。
    各级党委要求全体下放干部都要做到“四有”（有劳动手册、劳动工具、试验田、工作重点）。中共临汾县委要求每个下放干部要做到六好：工作深入完成任务好、发扬民主群众路线的工作方法好、思想进步努力学习好、关心群众生活帮助群众解决困难好、服从领导组织纪律好、试验田搞的好。
    各级领导干部下放到公社、管理区、生产队以后，都和群众同吃同住同劳动，积极参加生产，深入实际，调查研究，并随时发现问题、解决问题，推动了公社的生产和工作。中共左云县委第一书记关毅到东风公社后，和社员们一起积极劳动，社员们普遍赞扬说：“毛主席爱人民，派下干部到农村，干部社员是一家，共同来把生产抓，咱们共同加干劲，亩产千斤算个啥。”陕　西
    新华社西安8日电　陕西省各级领导机关最近有大批干部下放到人民公社当一个时期的社员。据长安、临潼、盩厔等十一个县市到6日止的初步统计，下放到人民公社当社员的干部已有一千一百六十三人，其中有不少是县委书记、县长、部长等领导干部。另外还有八十四名县委书记和县长下放担任公社的领导工作。
    陕西省省级机关的干部下放工作正在热烈展开。不少机关的墙壁上贴满了干部要求下放的申请书和决心书。预计省级机关将有六百多名干部下放到人民公社当社员，其中厅局长和处科长级以上干部将有一百多名。共青团陕西省委员会也决定从全省团委机关中下放八百多名干部当社员。
    中共陕西省委对这次干部下放工作十分重视，早在2月中旬就专门发出了通知。省委组织部最近并在临潼县召开现场会议，交流了下放干部工作的经验，参观了干部参加劳动的情形。
    陕西省去年共下放干部三万五千多名，他们无论在学习生产斗争知识、改造思想和传播文化技术知识方面，都取得了很大的成绩。
    甘　肃
    新华社兰州10日电　甘肃全省的十多万名干部今年都将以各种方式参加劳动锻炼。目前已经有五千二百多名干部下放到农村当公社社员，还有大批下放干部正准备陆续下放参加农业生产。
    已经下放当社员的干部大部分是省科、处长级和县级干部，其中一部分将下放一年，一部分是到农村劳动一至几个月。他们有的在公社的生产队劳动、搞试验田和小面积高额丰产田，有的到公社担任炊事员、饲养员、管理员和保育员。
    这些干部当社员以后，都能以普通劳动者的姿态出现，勤勤恳恳，与群众同吃同住同劳动，不但能较快地加强了劳动观点，提高思想觉悟，同时更加密切了和群众的联系，对生产和基层工作都起了一定作用。共青团武山县委书记李桂下放到永门公社后，当了东顺青年突击队队员，为确保五百亩小麦实现高额丰产指标，提出了六项新措施。山丹县位奇公社总支书记黄家声，下放当社员已经一个多月，在积肥运动中他和社员们开展劳动竞赛，有力地推动了积肥工作。永昌县和山丹县共有三百九十四名公社党委书记、生产队党支部书记、生产队长下放当炊事员、饲养员、保育员和管理员，群众非常满意。
    参加体力劳动已在甘肃省广大干部中形成一种风气。除了下放干部外，下乡帮助人民公社整社工作的四万五千名各级干部，都参加公社的生产劳动。农村基层干部在去冬开始就以三分之一以上的时间同农民一起下地生产。
    湖　南
    新华社长沙10日电　湖南省、地、县三级今年已经下放两万二千多名干部到工厂、农村进行劳动锻炼和加强基层的领导力量。各地人民公社也下放了大批干部，到基层单位参加生产、领导生产。

    各地下放到农村当社员的干部，都以普通劳动者的身份同群众一起劳动和生活。中共衡阳地委秘书长董学林下放在道县车头人民公社，在积肥运动中，常常天刚亮就出外捡狗粪，有时捡到一百多斤，在群众中产生了良好影响。龙山县召市公社党委书记骆明材下放到生产队后，同群众一起创造一种运肥船，提高工效五倍多。一些原来比较后进的公社和生产队，在下放干部的帮助和干部、社员的努力下，有了许多进步。双峰县和邵阳县有三百五十多个生产队，在干部下放领导加强后成为先进队。宁远县委副书记卢久兴下放到公社以后，和社员们一起劳动生产，带动全社干部通过参加生产来领导生产，解决了生产中的一些问题，使全县公社工作显著提高。
    吉　林
    新华社长春11日电　吉林省各级领导机关继续抽调干部下放劳动锻炼和充实基层领导力量。
    吉林省今年下放干部采取多种多样形式。省直机关第一批下放的九十名处、科级领导干部，分别到全省六个地区较长期地参加基层工作和劳动锻炼。吉林省农业厅党组最近决定，从3月到10月，将厅内能参加体力劳动的处、科长和农业技师以上的领导干部和技术干部，分五批轮流到人民公社当社员。其中第一批下放的八名干部，已由副厅长田青率领到人民公社参加劳动。省委机关第一批参加劳动锻炼的三十一名干部，到省委机关自办的钢厂和机械厂劳动。磐石、怀德、梨树、永吉等四个县最近抽调了四十多名县委委员以上领导干部到人民公社担任党委书记或社长。大安、榆树、临江、长岭等县也分别作出规划，准备今年内将县级以上领导干部分批下放到人民公社当两个月以上的社员。
    中共吉林省委最近要求各地轮流到基层担任领导工作和参加劳动的领导干部，应当和领导机关建立的基点结合起来；领导干部搞试验田，应当采取干部和群众相结合的办法。省委规定，下放期间的各方面表现，应作为考察和了解干部的重要情况。
    黑龙江
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　黑龙江省今年首批下放的干部，在密切联系群众，带领群众并且和群众一起搞生产上，已经有了良好的开端。
    今年全省已经有一千三百多名干部下放到农村和工厂，他们到基层的时间虽然不长，但在密切联系群众、带动群众搞生产上，已经有了良好的开端。绥化县人民法院审判员刘英下放到新华人民公社当社员，看到送粪工具不足，就和群众一起研究，改革、创造送粪工具，使送粪效率提高十倍。哈尔滨肉类联合加工厂的领导干部轮流离职到车间当工人后，对改进工厂一些薄弱环节的工作起了良好作用。厂长徐彦凯下到副食品车间当工人后，了解到这个车间有些工人，执行操作规程不严，影响产品质量，就以身作则地认真执行操作规程，并提出许多改进措施，使这个车间的生产情况有了改进。这个工厂的党委副书记刘洪祥到食堂当炊事员后，帮助食堂建立了一些工作制度，改进了食堂工作，基本上消灭了吃饭排队的现象，使食堂工作有了许多进步。
    海南岛
    本报讯　海南岛已经有四千四百二十个县级机关干部和公社一级脱产干部下放到公社当社员或到基层单位担负领导工作。
    这批干部大部分是轮流下放当社员或工人，直接参加生产，时间一般是三个月到半年左右；另外有一部分是下放到公社、管理区、生产队担任领导工作，加强农业生产的第一线，并且进一步锻炼自己。东方县已经下放的县、公社干部共有六百三十五人；全县六十六个管理区当中，有五十五个管理区的党总支书记或主任是由县委部长、公社党委书记、社长下放担任的。
