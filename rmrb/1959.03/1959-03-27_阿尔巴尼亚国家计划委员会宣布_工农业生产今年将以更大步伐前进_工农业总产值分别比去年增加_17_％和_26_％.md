Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 26th. The continuously and rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production of Albania will advance at an even greater pace this year. According to the plan formulated by the Albanian State Planning Commission, the total industrial output value this year will reach 30.55 billion leks (Albanian currency), an increase of 17% compared to last year; the total agricultural output value will reach 32.3 billion leks, an increase of 26% compared to last year.

    This year, 53% of Albania's total state budget expenditure will be invested in national economic construction, with a total amount of over 14 billion leks, an increase of more than 40% compared to the previous year.

    According to the targets set by the Albanian Labor Party, the production of all industrial sectors, whether producing means of production or means of consumption, will increase by 10% to 20% compared to 1958.

    Albania has greatly expanded investment in the mining industry and geological exploration, which occupy an important position in the national economy. This year, the output of chromium ore will increase by 25%, while the output of iron ore will almost double. The output of these two ores is expected to reach 250,000 tons and 175,000 tons respectively. In terms of geological exploration, the focus will be on prospecting for chromium and oil deposits, and the geological re-survey of 140 square kilometers will also be completed.

    Albania will vigorously develop the oil industry and cotton textile industry established after liberation. This year, the annual oil production will reach 550,000 tons; the annual cotton cloth production will reach 23.3 million meters. Based on Albania's national population of 1.5 million, there will be one ton of oil for less than three people, and 15.5 meters of cotton cloth for each person. Before liberation, each person had an average of only 27 centimeters of cotton cloth.

    Albania's total investment in construction projects this year will reach over 5.88 billion leks, an increase of 28% compared to 1958. Among them, the amount used for production departments accounts for 7%. This year, more than 200 large and medium-sized construction projects will be newly built and expanded. Among them, the new ones include the Tirana United Food Factory, the Kurbnesh copper ore processing plant, the crushed coal plant, the tobacco factory, two hydropower stations, and three brick and tile factories; the existing ones that will be expanded include the Cerrik oil refinery and the Vlora cement plant.

    In terms of agricultural production, the biggest feature this year is the requirement to rapidly produce more grain and cash crops. This year, grain production will increase by 64% compared to last year, approximately 180,000 tons. Cotton production will increase by 34%, and tobacco production will increase by 28%. Sugar beet production is planned to increase by 78%. In order to fully supply the people with non-staple foods, the milk yield of each dairy cow in the country should be increased from 655 kilograms to 752 kilograms, the number of pigs should be increased by 26%, and poultry should be increased by 32.5%.

    In addition, in order to improve the living conditions of the people, the state will build new residential areas with a total area of 220,000 square meters this year.

    This year is the 15th anniversary of Albania's liberation and the fourth year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In order to welcome this festival and overfulfill the 1959 production plan, the broad masses of workers and peasants have actively launched a socialist labor competition. (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会宣布
    工农业生产今年将以更大步伐前进
    工农业总产值分别比去年增加17％和26％
    新华社地拉那26日电　不断迅速发展的阿尔巴尼亚工农业生产，今年将以更大的步伐向前迈进。根据阿尔巴尼亚国家计划委员会制订的计划，今年工业总产值将达三百零五亿五千万里克（阿币），比去年增加17％；农业总产值将达三百二十三亿里克，比去年增加26％。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚国家预算支出总额的53％将投资于国民经济建设，其总额将达一百四十多亿里克，比前一年增加了40％多。
    根据阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出的指标，今年无论生产生产资料或生产消费资料的各个工业部门的生产都将比1958年提高10％到20％。
    阿尔巴尼亚今年大大地扩大了在国民经济中占有重要地位的采矿工业和地质勘探的投资。今年，铬矿石的产量将增长25％，而铁矿石的产量将差不多要增加一倍。这两种矿石的产量预计将分别达到二十五万吨和十七万五千多吨。在地质勘探方面，重点将放在铬矿和石油矿藏的普查工作上，同时还将完成一百四十平方公里的地质复查工作。
    阿尔巴尼亚今年将大力发展在解放后建立起来的石油工业和棉纺工业。今年石油年产量将达到五十五万吨；棉布的年产量将达到二千三百三十万公尺。以阿尔巴尼亚全国一百五十万人口平均计算，不到三个人就有一吨石油，每一人就有十五点五公尺的棉布。而解放前每人平均只有二十七公分的棉布。
    阿尔巴尼亚今年在建筑工程方面的投资总额达五十八亿八千多万里克，比1958年增加28％。其中，用于生产部门的数额占7％。今年全国新建和扩建的大中型建筑工程将达二百多项。其中新建的有地拉那联合食品工厂、库尔布奈什铜矿石加工厂、碎煤厂、烟草厂、两个水电站和三个砖瓦厂等；开始扩建的有柴立克炼油厂和发罗拉水泥厂等。
    在农业生产方面，今年最大的特点是要求迅速生产更多的粮食和经济作物。今年粮食将要比去年增产64％，约十八万吨。棉花将增产34％，烟草将增产28％。而甜菜则计划增产78％。为了能够充分供应广大人民的副食品，今年全国每头奶牛的产乳量应从六百五十五公斤增加到七百五十二公斤，猪的头数应增加26％，家禽增加32.5％。
    此外，为改善广大人民的居住条件，今年国家新建的住宅面积将达二十二万平方公尺。
    今年是阿尔巴尼亚解放十五周年，也是第二个五年计划的第四年。为迎接这一节日的到来和超额完成1959年的生产计划，目前广大工农群众已经积极地展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。（附图片）
