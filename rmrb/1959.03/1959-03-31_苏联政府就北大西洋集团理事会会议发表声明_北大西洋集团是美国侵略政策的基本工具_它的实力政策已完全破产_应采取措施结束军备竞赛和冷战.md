Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th, TASS dispatch: The Soviet government issued a statement on March 29, 1959. The full text is as follows:

The North Atlantic Alliance (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Council will hold its regular meeting in Washington from April 2nd to 4th this year, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty establishing this organization.

Many statements made by leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states in recent months indicate that the purpose of convening this meeting is to further trumpet the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a league of nations pursuing defensive purposes.

However, today, ten years after the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, only those who have lost touch with reality and are unwilling to consider the facts would believe that this organization is a defensive organization rather than an aggressive one.

	The North Atlantic Group's Actions Over the Past Decade
	Clearly Demonstrate its Aggressive Nature

The actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over the past ten years most clearly demonstrate the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Alliance's foreign policy. Attempting to disprove this is tantamount to trying to turn black into white.

When this organization was established in 1949, the Soviet government warned the initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that the establishment of such an organization would have serious consequences for the cause of peace and international cooperation.

In explaining the nature of the North Atlantic Group, the Soviet government stated that this group was an extremely far-reaching manifestation of the aggressive intentions of a small group of countries that wanted to adapt, to varying degrees, the policies of other countries that were obedient to them or directly subordinate to them, to the realization of these purposes. The Soviet government pointed out at the time that the purpose pursued by this group was to establish world hegemony by force by one or two countries participating in this group, and therefore it was adapted to the purpose of launching a new war.

The Soviet government also pointed out that the actions of the US and British governments in establishing the North Atlantic Group violated their obligations to cooperate with the Soviet Union in maintaining international security, which they had undertaken under the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Agreement, and the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet government repeatedly advised Western countries not to establish exclusive military blocs aimed against other countries, but to strictly abide by the Four-Power Agreement and work together in the common interest of consolidating peace and developing international cooperation to solve the post-war problems that remained to be solved.

But the founders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization refused to take this path. It does not take much effort to explain why the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, primarily the US government, refused to take this only correct path that conformed to the interests of the people of all countries. What played a decisive role here was that the then-US ruling group believed that it had a monopoly on atomic weapons, and relying on this monopoly, it could force the solution of post-war problems on terms favorable to the United States. This refers to the attempt to force the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to meet the demands of the US government through pressure. The US government groundlessly attempted to dominate international affairs. The entire activity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was to surround the Soviet Union with military bases, deploy atomic weapons at these bases, and force the Soviet Union to make concessions. Propaganda began to clamor that they could only talk to the Soviet Union "from a position of strength"; a frenzied arms race was launched among the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The US ruling group established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the basic tool of its aggressive policy. It also held the view that, due to the existence of US military bases on the territory of other countries, the United States would be outside the area of direct military operations in the event of a new war. Any military adventures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would be paid for by the people of those countries where US military bases were established, primarily the people of Western European countries.

	The United States Wants to Force the Soviet Union to Accept Its Terms from a Position of Strength
	The Soviet Union's Scientific and Technological Achievements Have Foiled Its Calculations

Is it not clear to everyone now that the policy of the planners of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has completely gone bankrupt? This is extremely obvious even from the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has not been able to establish the so-called "position of strength" advantage, from which the planners of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization originally intended to force the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to accept its terms.

As early as the first few years of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's existence, the founders of this organization should have understood that these calculations were unfounded, because it was already clear at that time that the United States did not have any atomic monopoly. But, unfortunately, the US leadership did not draw the correct conclusion from this, but began to comfort itself with the idea that the United States had a much larger number of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and that the United States was still in a superior position because the Soviet Union did not have effective tools to deliver atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs to the American continent. The United States could still win any anti-Soviet war by relying on military bases established within the territory of other countries.

But the Soviet Union's scientific and technological achievements have also foiled this calculation. In the past two or three years, even the most stubborn believers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policies have witnessed this firsthand. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the words of US Secretary of State Dulles, who said that Soviet intercontinental rockets could reach the Americas in fifteen minutes. American military experts directly admitted that the United States had no weapons to stop and intercept these rockets, and in fact, it was simply impossible to have them.

If we talk about the military aspect of things, then the development of contemporary science and technology has reached such a level that as soon as any kind of weapon appears, it will be immediately replaced by a new, more destructive weapon. As a result, huge manpower and material resources are wasted in vain in order to engage in the arms race. Thus, these countries go further and further down the road of the arms race, which leads to further waste of huge manpower and material resources and exacerbates the threat of a new war.

Does the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the arms race since its establishment not prove this? The economists of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization calculate that the military expenditure of this organization has reached more than 500 billion US dollars in the ten years since its establishment, and it is still increasing year by year.

Are these huge expenditures not a heavy burden of taxes on the shoulders of the masses of the people? It should be known that taxes in the United States now account for one-third of the annual expenditure of an average American family.

Because the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization itself was for the purpose of implementing a "position of strength" policy and an arms race policy, all of its practical activities are aimed at hindering the relaxation of the international situation, preventing the improvement of relations between countries, making people nervous, and keeping the world in a constant state of war mania.

	The North Atlantic Group Has Not Taken a Single Constructive Step
	And Has Rejected All Peaceful Proposals of Socialist Countries

During the entire ten years since the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, its member states have not only failed to take any constructive steps, but have also rejected all the proposals of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries aimed at consolidating peace and developing mutual trust between countries. The examples of the hostile activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization against the cause of peace are countless. The purpose of these activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to undermine the security of many countries and provoke animosity and hatred between countries.

For example, the United States has established military bases in other countries' territories thousands or even tens of thousands of kilometers away from its American continent, and has set up atomic weapons and rocket weapons on these bases. Only those who have no political experience would believe that the establishment of these bases is for defensive purposes, in order to protect the security of the United States. It is clear to everyone that no one has threatened the United States or other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the past or now. If it is necessary to list some more evidence to prove that the aggressive spearhead of these bases is directed at the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, then just looking at the fact that American planes carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs take off from these bases and fly towards the Soviet border day and night will make people recognize without any doubt what the intention of establishing these bases is.

Although the development of military technology in recent years has made these bases lose their strategic significance, we must not ignore the danger that these bases pose to the cause of peace. American statesmen and generals still hope that after provoking a new war, they can use these bases to transfer, or at least mitigate, the retaliation against the United States. Although this calculation is in vain, the danger of military bases, especially the danger to the countries where they are located, will not be reduced because of this. It is understandable why the people of Europe and Asia are increasingly firmly opposed to the establishment of military bases and the deployment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons on their own territory.

When the organizers of the North Atlantic Alliance dragged West Germany into this group, adopted the policy of arming the West German army with atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and set up nuclear rocket installations on West German territory, the aggressive nature of this group became more obvious to the people of all countries. At the same time, it is clear that some people intend to use Hitlerite generals and officers with revanchist sentiments, who have been placed in the headquarters of the Bundeswehr and appointed to important command positions in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In fact, West Germany is becoming a war bridgehead in the center of Europe, the existence of which is increasingly aggravating the threat of war and primarily exposing West German residents to fatal danger. Who would doubt that once the North Atlantic Group provokes a new war, the areas in Europe and the Middle East where the main nuclear rocket bases are located, together with the bases across the ocean, will be subjected to devastating retaliation using nuclear weapons and rocket weapons.

Everyone should understand that the Soviet Union and its allies will not be unconcerned about their own security. Can there be other assumptions about the development of the situation if Western countries launch a war of aggression against the countries of the socialist camp?

	The North Atlantic Group's Aggressive Actions Sharpen the International Situation
	They Try to Unite Several Military Blocs to Plan Aggressive Wars

The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with their aggressive actions over the past ten years, have greatly sharpened the current international situation and created a situation in which any imprudent step could lead to serious consequences. Moreover, whenever the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries take measures to relax the international situation to some extent, the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization hastily take action to re-intensify the tension and often push humanity to the brink of war.

This was the case when two countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—Britain and France—with the actual support of the US ruling group, launched an aggression against Egypt. At the end of 1957, the actions of the aggressive forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Syrian region created the threat of igniting a war. In 1958, the United States and Britain attempted to maintain their original colonial status by force and suppress the national revolution in Iraq. To this end, they landed their troops in Lebanon and Jordan, using the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bases set up in the territories of the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and Turkey to transfer troops and transport military supplies to these two countries. In all these incidents, it was only thanks to the firm stance of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and because these aggressive actions were condemned in the United Nations, that the world was saved from a serious disaster.

In order to strengthen their rule and maintain their colonies around the world, the colonialist countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have tried their best to use the North Atlantic military alliance to suppress the increasingly broad national liberation movement. It has been more than four years since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obtained weapons from the United States to carry out a devastating war against the Algerian people. Colonialist countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, fearing the awakening African people, are trying to destroy the national liberation movements in African countries (Kenya, the Belgian Congo, Nyasaland, etc.). At the recent meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, the issue of the situation in African colonies was discussed on the initiative of the colonialist countries, and all this was done behind the backs of the people, because the people of all countries are increasingly resolutely demanding the complete elimination of the decadent and shameful colonialist system in Africa and Asia.

The fact that the activities of the North Atlantic Alliance have nothing in common with the "defensive" purposes proclaimed by the founders of this alliance is clearly demonstrated by the discussion of the situation in Indonesia at the meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in December 1957 and May 1958. This discussion, which was conducted in violation of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other countries, was a political intimidation of the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government, and later turned into assistance to the rebels against the legitimate Indonesian government.

It is worth noting that in recent years, the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been striving to realize a plan to unite, in one form or another, military blocs established by Western countries around the world, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact. This means that they want to link the aggressive blocs more closely together and extend their tentacles to areas where the national liberation movement is expanding and developing and where the old foundations of colonialism are collapsing. It is very clear that uniting countries on several continents to plan aggressive wars has serious consequences for the cause of peace.

Various facts can also be cited to prove the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive and anti-people activities, proving that it is not an instrument of peace, but an organization for preparing for war. The threat of a new war also makes the broad strata of residents in the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization worry about the fate of peace, and this threat is growing due to the policies and activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Any country that has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot say, on the tenth anniversary of the organization's establishment, that it is safer than it was before the group was established. Neither the British, the French, nor the Germans of West Germany can say that. On the contrary, it is precisely because of the activities of this aggressive alliance and the establishment of military bases on the territory of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that these countries have fallen into a situation in which they may be drawn into military conflicts against their will, and in this era of rocket weapons and nuclear weapons, such conflicts will produce all kinds of terrible consequences.

All of this explains why countries around the world are now increasingly strongly demanding an end to the meaningless arms race, demanding that the "Cold War" policy, which is deeply hated by the people of all countries, be abandoned, and demanding that they resolutely embark on the road of peaceful coexistence and broad cooperation among all countries. This is the path that the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed in the past and now. This path will not bring any unilateral benefits to any country, because it is in the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, so only by taking this path can humanity avoid a new war.

	The Soviet Union Suggests Taking Measures to Fundamentally Transform the International Situation.
	Mature Issues Should be Submitted to Summits and Meetings of Foreign Ministers.

In order to fundamentally change the current international situation and develop it in the direction of strengthening friendly relations and building an atmosphere of trust between countries, what measures can be taken in the near future?

The Soviet government believes that, in accordance with the recommendations of the Warsaw Treaty member states, the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization may be an important step in this regard. The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty would prove that the two organizations are willing to do everything in their power to ease international tensions and build mutual trust. At the same time, the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty would be an important factor in deterring any aggressor. Once the aggressor provokes a war, they will be isolated internationally and suffer the consequences.

The Soviet government believes that, under the current circumstances, measures such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states and the Warsaw Treaty member states reaching an agreement on the issue of not providing assistance to aggressors in the near future are also fully in line with the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet government requests the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states to consider the proposal put forward by the Soviet government last December. This proposal proposes to discuss the following issue: including in the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty a provision stipulating that its member states shall not provide any aggressor with military or economic assistance, or moral support. Taking into account that, according to the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, this treaty can be reviewed and revised after its ten-year term expires, that is, this April, the Soviet government proposes that both parties agree to include in the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty the relevant provisions on not providing assistance to aggressors.

The undertaking of such obligations by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and the Warsaw Treaty member states is fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and has significant positive significance for preventing aggression. If aggression still occurs, then the obligation not to provide assistance to the aggressor will prevent the conflict from escalating into a world war and stop it as soon as it occurs.

The Soviet government also believes that the task of preventing the dangerous accumulation of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in Central Europe—a region where a large number of armed forces of two opposing military blocs are adjacent—is now becoming an increasingly urgent issue. Therefore, the Soviet government calls on the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states to discuss the implementation of the proposal put forward by the government of the People's Republic of Poland on establishing a nuclear weapon-free, hydrogen weapon-free, and rocket weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The establishment of such a zone will greatly ease the existing tensions on the European continent and have a positive impact on the entire international situation.

In view of the existing situation in Europe, it is also urgently necessary to reach an agreement on the important issue of reducing the number of foreign troops on German territory and in other European countries to the agreed number. The Soviet government has repeatedly put forward relevant proposals on this issue to the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, its starting point being that the stationing and increase of foreign troops in the territory of other countries is an abnormal phenomenon in peacetime. The Soviet government now reiterates the proposal to reduce foreign troops stationed in the territory of European countries, and expresses its firm belief that doing so will greatly help ensure the security of Europe.

The Soviet government proposes to reach an agreement on reducing foreign troops on German territory and in other European countries, and the Soviet government is also prepared to participate in the study of such issues as the disengagement of the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states and the Warsaw Treaty member states, or the establishment of zones restricting troops, armaments, and implementing supervision. Taking into account that the close proximity of the armed forces of the two organizations inevitably carries the risk of conflicts and dangerous incidents, the necessity of taking such measures is even more obvious. The mutual withdrawal of troops by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, or even just limiting armaments, armed forces, and troops in certain areas in the initial stage, would greatly alleviate this threat, thereby reducing the possibility of various accidental incidents. The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states themselves also admit that such accidental incidents can cause serious consequences.

The Soviet government reiterates that it is urgent to solve such major and mature issues as the complete prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons from the armaments of all countries, and the substantial reduction of the conventional armaments and armed forces of all countries. The Soviet government proposes that an agreement be reached immediately on the permanent cessation of testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons as the first important step in solving these tasks.

It is also clear that peace on the European continent can hardly be guaranteed if the central problem of Europe—the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the normalization of the status of West Berlin—is not resolved. The Soviet government believes that the formulation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is now the most urgent and pressing task. After the conclusion of the peace treaty, it will eliminate such an abnormal and intolerable situation: the Second World War has ended for almost fourteen years, but the German people still do not have a peace treaty and are deprived of the possibility of fully exercising their national sovereignty.

After the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany, it will end the dangerous development of the West German situation, eliminate the possibility of using German militarism against any country, and promote the two Germanys to solve their basic national tasks themselves—unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis.

As for the Berlin issue, the Soviet government believes that the most realistic way to solve this problem is to grant West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city, and the United Nations can actively participate in maintaining this status. As everyone knows, the Soviet government has also put forward some other suggestions in order to facilitate the relevant countries to reach an agreement on the Berlin issue. The abolition of the occupation system in West Berlin will turn this city from a hotbed of dangerous conflicts into a city of peace and tranquility.

The Soviet government believes that it would be of great benefit to submit the mature international issues to the discussion of the heads of government, as suggested in the Soviet government's note to the Western countries on March 2. However, if the Western countries are not yet ready to participate in high-level talks, the Soviet government believes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the relevant countries can be convened to discuss the peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet government declares that it agrees with the proposal of the US, British, and French governments that representatives of the two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—participate in this meeting.

If the relevant governments have the desire to reach an agreement, there are many steps that have long been ripe and possible to reach an agreement on, which are far from being listed one by one here.

Throughout the post-war period, the Soviet government has taken many measures aimed at enabling countries to reach a mutually agreed-upon solution in order to ease international tensions, strengthen trust between countries, and ensure lasting peace among the people of all countries. It is only because the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are unwilling to respond to the Soviet Union's peace measures and continue to implement a policy of intensifying international relations that the dangerous situation has been maintained until now, and the combustible materials in the international situation have accumulated more and more. If it is in the interests of peace, it must be recognized that the current situation is intolerable. Measures must be taken without delay to end the arms race and the "Cold War," or even take the first few steps in this regard.

If the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization discuss the mature international issues from this position at the upcoming meeting (the Soviet Union has put forward many constructive suggestions on these issues), then they will have made no small contribution to the cause of peace. As for the Soviet government, it will continue to make every effort to develop the world situation in such a direction as to create conditions so that people will no longer fear for their own destiny and the destiny of future generations.

### 苏联政府就北大西洋集团理事会会议发表声明  北大西洋集团是美国侵略政策的基本工具  它的实力政策已完全破产　应采取措施结束军备竞赛和冷战

    苏联政府就北大西洋集团理事会会议发表声明
    北大西洋集团是美国侵略政策的基本工具
    它的实力政策已完全破产　应采取措施结束军备竞赛和冷战
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日电：苏联政府1959年3月29日声明，全文如下：
    北大西洋联盟（北大西洋公约组织）理事会将于今年4月2日至4日，即当关于建立这个组织的条约签订十周年之际，在华盛顿举行例会。
    北大西洋公约组织成员国领导人近几个月来发表的许多声明表明，召开这次会议是为了进一步大肆吹嘘北大西洋公约组织是一个追求防御目的的国家联盟。
    但是，在北大西洋公约组织成立十周年后的今天，只有丧失现实感和不愿意考虑事实的人才会认为这个组织是防御性的组织而不是侵略性的组织。
    北大西洋集团十年来的所作所为
    明显不过地表明了它的侵略实质
    北大西洋公约组织十年来的所作所为最明显不过地表明了北大西洋联盟的外交政策方针的侵略实质。想反证这点就等于企图颠倒黑白。
    在1949年这个组织成立的时候，苏联政府就警告过北大西洋公约组织的发起人说，建立这种组织会给和平和国际合作事业带来严重的后果。
    苏联政府在说明北大西洋集团的性质时曾经声明，这个集团是一小撮国家侵略企图的极为深远的表现，这些国家想使顺从它们或者直接从属于它们的其他国家政府的政策在不同程度上适应于实现自己的这些目的。苏联政府当时指出，这个集团所追求的目的是，参加这个集团的一两个国家用武力建立世界霸权，因而它是适应于发动新战争的目的的。
    苏联政府还指出，美国和英国政府建立北大西洋集团的做法破坏了同苏联在维护国际安全方面合作的义务，这些义务是它们根据雅尔达协定、波茨坦协定和联合国宪章所承担的。
    苏联政府曾再三劝告西方国家不要建立旨在反对其他国家的排他性的军事集团，而严格遵守四国协定，本着巩固和平和发展国际合作的利益共同努力解决战后有待解决的问题。
    但是北大西洋公约组织的建立者拒绝走这条路。用不着费很多笔墨来说明为什么北大西洋公约组织领导人，首先是美国政府拒绝走这条符合各国人民利益的唯一正确的道路。在这里起决定性作用的是，当时美国统治集团认为它在原子武器方面占有垄断地位，依靠这种垄断地位可以强使解决战后问题的条件有利于美国。这里是指企图通过压力迫使苏联和人民民主国家满足美国政府的要求，美国政府毫无理由地妄图在国际事务中称王称霸，北大西洋公约组织的整个活动都是为了用军事基地包围苏联，在这些基地上配置原子武器和迫使苏联让步。宣传中开始叫嚣说，同苏联只能“从实力地位”谈话；在北大西洋公约组织参加国中展开了狂热的军备竞赛。
    美国统治集团建立了北大西洋公约组织作为它的侵略政策的基本工具。它还抱有这种观点：由于在其他国家的领土上存在着美国的军事基地，一旦爆发新战争时美国将处于直接军事行动地区之外，北大西洋公约组织的任何军事冒险，都将由那些建立有美国军事基地的国家的人民，首先是由西欧各国的人民付出代价。
    美国想用实力地位迫使苏联接受它的条件
    苏联的科学技术成就已使它这种算盘落空
    北大西洋公约组织的策划者的政策完全破产了，这一点现在难道不是每个人都清楚吗？就是从下面的情况也可以极明显地看出这一点：北大西洋公约组织没有能够建立起所谓“实力地位”的优势，北大西洋公约组织的策划者原打算从这种“实力地位”出发来迫使苏联和人民民主国家接受它的条件。
    早在北大西洋公约组织存在的头几年，这个组织的建立者就应该明白这些算盘是没有根据的，因为当时已经可以看出，美国并不拥有什么原子垄断地位。但是，遗憾的是，美国领导集团没有由此得出正确的结论，却开始用这样一种想法安慰自己，即美国拥有数量上多得多的原子弹和氢弹，美国仍然居于优势地位，因为苏联没有把原子弹和氢弹送到美洲大陆去的有效工具，美国仍然可以凭借在其他国家境内建立的军事基地赢得任何反苏战争。
    但是，苏联的科学技术成就也使这种算盘落了空。最近两三年以来就连北大西洋公约组织政策的最顽固的信奉者也亲眼看到了这一点。在这方面，不妨提一下美国国务卿杜勒斯的话，他说，苏联的洲际火箭可以在十五分钟以内到达美洲。美国的军事专家直截了当地承认，美国没有任何阻挡和拦截这种火箭的武器，而且实际上也根本不可能有。
    如果谈到事情的军事方面，那么，当代科学技术的发展已经达到这样的水平：任何种类的武器一经出现，就会立即被新的、破坏性更大的武器所代替。结果，为了进行军备竞赛白白耗费巨大的人力和物力，于是这些国家在这条军备竞赛的道路上越走越远，军备竞赛招致巨大的人力物力的进一步浪费，并且加剧发生新战争的威胁。
    北大西洋公约组织建立以来在军备竞赛方面耗费了几千亿美元，难道不正说明这一点吗？北大西洋公约组织的经济学家们计算，这个组织的军事开支在它成立的十年中，已经达到五千亿美元以上，而且现在还在逐年增加。
    这批巨额开支难道不是落在人民群众肩上的捐税重担吗？要知道，现在美国的捐税占去一个中等水平的美国家庭每年开支的三分之一。
    由于北大西洋公约组织的建立本身就是为了实行“实力地位”政策和军备竞赛政策，因此它的一切实际活动都是为了阻挠国际局势的缓和，使国与国之间的关系不能改善；使人们的神经紧张，使世界处于经常的战争狂热的状态。
    北大西洋集团没有采取一项建设性的步骤
    而且拒绝了社会主义国家的一切和平建议
    北大西洋公约组织的成员国在这个组织成立的整整十年期间，不仅没有采取任何一项建设性步骤，而且还拒绝了苏联和人民民主国家的旨在巩固和平和发展国与国之间彼此信任的一切建议。北大西洋公约组织对和平事业所采取的敌对活动的例证是不胜枚举的，北大西洋公约组织这些活动的目的就是要破坏很多国家的安全并挑拨各国之间的敌意和仇恨。
    例如，美国在远离其美洲大陆几千公里甚至几万公里以外的他国领土上建立军事基地，并在这些基地上设置原子武器和火箭武器。只有毫无政治经验的人才会相信，建立这些基地是出于防御目的，是为了保卫美国安全的。人们清楚地知道，任何人过去和现在都没有威胁美国，或是北大西洋公约组织的其他成员国。如果还需要再列举一些证据来证明，这些基地的侵略矛头是针对着苏联和人民民主国家，那么，只要看一看从这些基地起飞的载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境方向昼夜飞行这一事实，就会使人们毫不怀疑地认识到，建立这些基地是何居心。
    尽管近年来由于军事技术的发展已经使得这些基地根本失去战略意义，但是我们决不能忽视这些基地给和平事业带来的危险。美国的政府家和将军们仍然指望，在挑起新战争以后，他们可以利用这些基地转移、或者至少可以减轻对美国的回击。虽然打这种算盘是枉费心机的，但是，军事基地的危险性，首先是对它们所在的那些国家的危险性并不会因此而减少。欧洲和亚洲人民为什么日益坚决地反对在本国领土上建立军事基地和设置原子武器和火箭武器，这是可以理解的。
    当北大西洋联盟的组织者把西德拉进这个集团，采取了用原子武器和氢武器武装西德军队的方针，并在西德领土上设置核火箭装置的时候，这个集团的侵略性质对各国人民来说就变得更加明显了。同时，显然有人打算利用有复仇主义情绪的希特勒将领和军官，这些人已经被安插在联邦国防军的首脑机关，并且任命他们在北大西洋公约组织中担任重要的指挥职务。实际上西德正在变成欧洲中心的战争桥头堡，这个战争桥头堡的存在日益加剧着战争的威胁，并首先使西德居民遭受致命的危险。有谁会怀疑，一旦北大西洋集团挑起新的战争，欧洲和中东设有主要核火箭基地的地区连同大洋彼岸的基地都要遭到使用核武器和火箭武器的毁灭性回击。
    人人都该明白，苏联和它的盟国不会不关心自己的安全。如果西方国家对社会主义阵营国家发动侵略战争的话，难道可以对事态的发展有其他的设想吗？
    北大西洋集团的侵略行动使国际局势尖锐化
    它们力图联合几个军事集团来策划侵略战争
    北大西洋公约组织的领导人在这十年中，以自己的侵略行动使现在的国际局势大大地尖锐化了，并且造成了这样一种局面：任何一个不慎重的步骤都会导致严重的后果，不仅如此，每当苏联和其他爱好和平的国家采取措施使国际局势在某些时候有所缓和的时候，北大西洋公约组织领导人便连忙采取行动，重新加剧紧张局势，并且往往把人类推上战争边缘。
    北大西洋公约组织的两个国家——英国和法国在美国统治集团的实际支持下对埃及进行侵略时，情况就是如此。1957年底，北大西洋公约组织成员国侵略势力的行动在叙利亚地区造成了燃起战火的威胁。1958年，美国和英国企图以武力保持自己原来的殖民地位，镇压伊拉克的民族革命。为此，它们使自己的军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆，利用设置在德意志联邦共和国、意大利和土耳其领土上的北大西洋公约组织军事基地来向这两个国家调遣军队和运送军火。在所有这些事件中，只是由于苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的坚决立场，由于在联合国对这些侵略行动进行了谴责，才挽救了世界免遭严重的灾难。
    参加北大西洋公约组织的殖民主义国家为了加强自己的统治和保持自己在世界各处的殖民地，竭力利用北大西洋军事联盟来镇压日益壮阔的民族解放运动。通过北大西洋公约组织从美国得到武器来进行反对阿尔及利亚人民的毁灭性战争已经四年多了。北大西洋公约组织的殖民主义国家由于害怕正在觉醒的非洲人民，企图摧毁非洲国家（怯尼亚、比属刚果、尼亚萨兰等国）的民族解放运动。在北大西洋公约组织理事会最近举行的各次会议上根据殖民主义国家的倡议讨论了关于非洲殖民地局势的问题，而且这一切都是瞒着人民干的，因为各国人民正在越来越坚决地主张完全消灭在非洲和亚洲的腐朽而可耻的殖民主义制度。
    北大西洋联盟的活动同这个联盟的创立者所宣扬的“防御”目的没有任何共同之处，明显的证明就是：在1957年12月和1958年5月的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上讨论印度尼西亚的局势问题。联合国宪章禁止干涉别国内政，在破坏联合国宪章的情况下进行的这种讨论，是对印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚政府的政治恫吓，并且后来变为对反对合法的印度尼西亚政府的叛乱分子的援助。
    值得注意的是，近几年来北大西洋公约组织领导人正在竭力实现一个计划：想用这种或那种形式把北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约这样一些西方国家在世界各地建立起来的军事集团联合起来。这就是说，他们要把侵略集团更加紧密地联系在一起，并且把触角伸向那些民族解放运动日益扩大和发展的、殖民主义的古老基础正在崩塌的地区。十分明显，联合几个大陆的国家来策划侵略战争，这对和平事业孕育着严重的后果。
    还可以列举各种事实来证明北大西洋公约组织的侵略活动和反人民活动，证明它不是和平的工具，而是备战的组织。爆发新战争的威胁也使得北大西洋公约成员国内的广大居民阶层为和平的命运担忧，而这种威胁由于北大西洋公约组织的政策和活动在日益增长。加入北大西洋公约组织的任何一个国家，在这个组织已经成立了十年的今天，都不能说，它比这个集团成立以前更加安全了。无论英国人、法国人、西德的德国人都不能这样说。恰恰相反，正是由于这个侵略联盟的活动和在北大西洋公约组织成员国领土上建立军事基地，这些国家陷入了这样一种境地：他们可能违背自己的意志被卷入军事冲突，而在我们这个火箭武器和核武器的时代，这种冲突将产生种种可怕的后果。
    这一切都说明，为什么世界各国现在日益强烈地要求停止毫无意义的军备竞赛，要求放弃各国人民所深恶痛绝的“冷战”政策，要求坚决走上所有国家和平共处和广泛合作的道路。这就是要走苏联政府过去和现在所一再提出的道路。这条道路不会给任何一个国家带来任何单方面的好处，因为它符合各国人民的根本利益，所以，只有走这条道路，人类才能避免新的战争。
    苏联建议采取措施来使国际局势根本转变应把成熟的问题提交首脑会议和外长会议　
    为了使当前国际局势发生根本转变，使它朝着加强国与国之间的友好关系和建立信任气氛的方向发展，最近可以采取哪些措施呢？
    苏联政府认为，按照华沙条约成员国的建议，北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织之间缔结互不侵犯条约，可能是这方面的重要步骤。缔结互不侵犯条约会证明这两个组织愿意尽它们的一切力量来缓和国际紧张局势和建立彼此之间的信任。同时，缔结互不侵犯条约会是制止任何侵略者的一个重要因素，一旦侵略者挑起战争，他们在国际上就会处于孤立，并且自食其果。
    苏联政府认为，在当前情况下，像最近就可以采取的，北大西洋公约组织成员国同华沙条约成员国就不给侵略者以援助问题达成协议这样的措施，也是完全符合巩固欧洲和平利益的。因此，苏联政府要求北大西洋公约组织成员国政府考虑苏联政府去年12月提出的建议。这项建议提议讨论下列问题：在北大西洋公约和华沙条约中列入这样一条，即规定其成员国不得给予任何侵略者以军事和经济上的援助，或是道义上的支持。考虑到，根据北大西洋公约条款的规定，在它十年有效期届满之后，即到今年4月，可以重新审查和修改这一公约，苏联政府建议双方协议在华沙条约和北大西洋公约中列入关于不给予侵略者以援助的有关条款。
    北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约成员国承担这种义务，完全符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，并且对防止侵略有着重大的积极意义。如果仍然发生侵略的话，那末，不给予侵略者援助的义务就会使冲突不致扩大为世界大战，而在它刚刚发生的时候就加以制止。
    苏联政府并且认为，在欧洲中部——两个对立的军事集团大量武装部队邻接的地区——防止危险地积累核武器和火箭武器的任务，现在成为越来越迫切的问题。因此苏联政府呼吁北大西洋公约组织成员国政府来商讨实现波兰人民共和国政府提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器地区的建议。建立这种地区将大大缓和欧洲大陆现存的紧张局势，并且对整个国际局势产生良好影响。
    鉴于欧洲的现存局势，也迫切需要就把德国领土上和其他欧洲国家境内的外国军队裁减到议定的数目这样一个重要问题达成协议。苏联政府不止一次地就这个问题向北大西洋公约组织成员国政府提出有关的建议，它的出发点是，在别国的领土上驻扎和增加外国军队是和平时期的不正常现象。苏联政府现在重申关于裁减驻扎在欧洲国家领土上的外国军队的建议，并且表示坚信，这样做将大大有助于保证欧洲的安全。
    苏联政府建议就裁减德国领土上和其他欧洲国家境内的外国军队一事达成协议，苏联政府也准备参加研究这样一些问题，例如北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国武装部队脱离接触的问题，或是建立限制军队、军备和实行监督的地区问题。考虑到这两个组织的武装部队紧靠在一起总不免有发生冲突和危险事件的危险，采取这种措施的必要性就更加明显了。北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织互相撤退军队或者在初期哪怕是仅仅在一定地区限制军备、武装力量和军队，这都会大大减轻这种威胁，从而会减少发生各种各样偶然事件的可能性。北大西洋公约组织成员国的领导人自己也承认，这种偶然事件会引起严重后果。
    苏联政府再次指出，迫切需要解决这样一些重大的和业已成熟的问题，如完全禁止和从各国军备中取缔核武器的问题，大量裁减各国常规军备和武装力量的问题。苏联政府建议，立即就永久停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题达成协议，作为解决这些任务方面的第一个重要步骤。
    如果欧洲的中心问题——缔结对德和约的问题以及西柏林地位正常化的问题得不到解决，欧洲大陆的和平就难以保障，这也是很清楚的。苏联政府认为，拟定和缔结对德和约是现在最紧要而迫切的任务。缔结和约之后，就会消除这样一种不正常的、令人不能容忍的局面：第二次世界大战结束已经差不多十四年了，可是德国人民仍然没有一个和约，并且被剥夺了充分行使自己国家主权的可能性。
    缔结对德和约之后，就会结束西德事态的危险性的发展，就会排除利用德国军国主义反对任何国家的可能性，就会促使两个德国自己解决它们的基本民族任务——在和平民主基础上统一德国。
    至于谈到柏林问题，苏联政府认为，解决这一问题的最现实的办法是给予西柏林以非军事化自由城市的地位，联合国可以积极参加维持这一地位。大家知道，苏联政府还提出了其他一些建议，以便于有关国家就柏林问题达成协议。取消西柏林的占领制度，会使这个城市由危险冲突的策源地变成和平安宁的城市。
    苏联政府认为，正如苏联政府3月2日给西方国家照会中所建议的那样，把已经成熟的国际问题提交政府首脑会议讨论是会带来极大的好处的。但是，如果西方国家还不准备参加高级会谈的话，苏联政府认为，为了讨论对德和约和西柏林问题，可以召开有关国家的外交部长会议。同时，苏联政府声明，它同意美国、英国和法国政府关于在这个会议上有两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加的建议。
    如果有关的政府具有达成协议的愿望的话，还有很多早已成熟和可能达成协议的步骤，这里远没有对它们加以一一列举。
    在整个战后时期，苏联政府采取了不少措施，旨在使各国达成大家都同意的解决办法，以缓和国际紧张局势，加强各国间的信任和保障各国人民间的持久和平。只是由于北大西洋公约组织成员国不愿响应苏联的和平措施，并且继续执行加剧国际关系的方针，危险的局势才一直保持到现在，国际局势中的燃烧物质才越聚越多。如果本着和平的利益，就必须承认，对目前的局势是不能容忍的。不能再迟迟不采取措施来结束军备竞赛和“冷战”，或者在这方面哪怕是迈出最初的几步。
    如果北大西洋公约组织成员国在即将举行的会议上从这种立场出发来讨论业已成熟的国际问题（苏联对这些问题已经提出了不少建设性的建议），那么，这样它们就为和平事业出了不小的力。至于苏联政府，它将继续多方努力以便使世界局势朝着这样的方向发展：创造条件使人们不再为自己和后代的命运而恐惧。　1959年3月29日
