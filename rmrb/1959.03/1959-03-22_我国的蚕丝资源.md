China's climate is mild, and its land is vast, providing very rich resources for the production of mulberry and tussah silk. Mulberry and tussah silk are China's special products. Compared with other countries in the world, China's mulberry silk production is second only to Japan; China's tussah silk production ranks first in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's total output.

China's mulberry silkworms are distributed in twenty-four provinces (regions) and municipalities, nearly a thousand counties. The main mulberry silkworm producing areas are: Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan and Guangdong. According to statistics in 1958, the national mulberry garden area was more than six million mu. China's tussah silkworms are distributed in seventeen provinces (regions) and municipalities, more than two hundred counties. Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, and Guizhou are famous tussah silk producing areas. China currently has approximately eighty million mu of tussah forests, of which less than 20% has been used for tussah silkworm rearing.

Before liberation, China's silk production was severely damaged. Although this production has been continuously restored and developed since liberation, with mulberry silkworm cocoons increasing by 19% and tussah silkworm cocoons increasing by 27% in 1958 compared to the previous year, silk production is still far from meeting the needs of export and domestic sales.

China has great potential for increasing silk production. Last year, five counties including Fanshun and Zhongshan in Guangdong and Deqing County in Zhejiang became high-yield counties with a yield of one thousand jin of leaves and one hundred jin of cocoons per mu. Last year, some areas obtained more cocoons by increasing the number of silkworm rearing cycles. If the advanced experiences of high-yield areas are earnestly promoted, the unit yield of mulberry silkworm cocoons nationwide will certainly be further and significantly improved. More than 80% of China's tussah forests have not been used for silkworm rearing. In addition to greatly improving the unit yield, tussah silk production can also expand the rearing area, and the potential for increased production is greater than that of mulberry silk.

    我国的蚕丝资源
    我国气候温和，土地辽阔，桑、柞蚕的生产资源非常丰富。桑、柞蚕丝是我国特产。和世界各国比较，我国桑蚕丝的产量只低于日本，居第二位；柞蚕丝的产量我国是第一位，占世界总产量的80％以上。
    我国桑蚕分布在二十四个省（区）、市，近一千多个县。主要桑蚕产区是：浙江、江苏、四川和广东。据1958年统计，全国桑园面积有六百多万亩。我国的柞蚕分布在十七个省（区）、市，二百多个县。辽宁、山东、河南、贵州是著名的柞蚕丝产区。我国现有柞林面积约八千多万亩，目前已利用放养柞蚕的还不到20％。
    在解放以前，我国蚕丝生产受到严重摧残。解放后这项生产虽然得到不断恢复发展，1958年桑蚕茧比前一年又增产19％，柞蚕茧比前一年又增产27％，但蚕丝的产量还是远不能满足出口和内销的需要。
    我国蚕丝生产增产的潜力很大。去年广东番顺、中山等五县和浙江德清县都成了亩产千斤叶、百斤茧的高产县。去年有些地区由于增加养蚕次数，获得了更多蚕茧。如果认真推广先进地区的高产经验，全国桑蚕茧的单位产量一定能够进一步地显著提高。我国柞林还有80％以上没有利用养蚕，柞蚕生产除了可以大大提高单位产量以外，还可以扩大放养面积，增产潜力比桑蚕还大。
