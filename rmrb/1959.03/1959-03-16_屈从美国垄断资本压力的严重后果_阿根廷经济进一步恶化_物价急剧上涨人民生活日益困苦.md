The Argentine is experiencing serious economic difficulties. In January and February of this year, the prices of various foods and consumer goods, as well as the cost of public utilities, have risen sharply, with the prices of many commodities even doubling or tripling. The Argentine people have generally launched a struggle against rising prices and are turning this struggle into a national struggle to improve the country's economic situation.

The soaring prices and further deterioration of the economic situation in Argentina are the result of the Frondizi government's implementation of the "Economic Stabilization Plan" formulated by the International Monetary Fund, which is controlled by the United States.

When Frondizi took office as president on May 1, 1958, Argentina's economy was already in crisis. U.S. imperialism and Argentina's domestic reactionaries took advantage of this to put pressure on Frondizi. In this situation, in order to obtain $329 million in loans from the International Monetary Fund and U.S. banks as part of the so-called "Economic Stabilization Plan," the Frondizi government accepted the enslaving conditions proposed by the International Monetary Fund, which essentially allowed the United States to interfere in Argentina's internal affairs. These conditions were: to abolish the free exchange rate between the peso (Argentine currency) and the dollar, massively reduce government employees, freeze workers' wages, restrict the right to strike, abolish restrictions on imports of U.S. goods, increase domestic taxes, no longer provide any financial subsidies to state-owned enterprises, reduce trade with socialist countries, and create a "favorable climate" for foreign investment, and so on. This plan was entirely formulated with the participation of the United States. Frondizi's "Economic Stabilization Plan" and the loans granted to Argentina by the International Monetary Fund and U.S. banks were announced simultaneously on December 29, 1958. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy boasted that this "cooperation" by the United States was a "broad financial action never before taken in Latin America." In reality, this is an action by U.S. imperialism to further exploit and control Argentina. This action has already brought great difficulties to Argentina's economy. The Frondizi government does not hide this. Frondizi himself admitted in a radio address on February 19 that since the implementation of the "Economic Stabilization Plan," suffering and poverty have deepened. According to him, "the current serious state of life will continue... before improving this situation, we will have to go through a period of rising prices."

The first measure taken by the Frondizi government to implement the "Economic Stabilization Plan" was to abolish the official exchange rate of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar from January 1 this year, and to implement a new unified free exchange rate for the peso from January 12, which is determined according to demand. At that time, the official exchange rate between the peso and the dollar was 18 pesos to one dollar, while the free market exchange rate was 68 to one, which meant that the Argentine peso was devalued by more than two-thirds. The result of the peso's devaluation was a rise in prices, first of all, the prices of imported goods, especially those imported from the United States, and the prices of other goods followed suit. In the first few days of implementing the "Economic Stabilization Plan," the Argentine government increased the price of liquid fuel by 2.7 times, the cost of urban transportation by 50% to 100%, and railway transportation costs by 60%. From January 1, the price of meat increased by 33%, and the price of fish increased by 100%. From January 12, the price of newspapers doubled. The Argentine bourgeois newspaper "La Razón" pointed out that in less than a year, the price of meat has increased by 700%. On January 14, the National Secretariat of Commerce announced a decision according to which factory owners, wholesalers, and merchants have the right to increase the prices of vegetable oil, flour, bread, macaroni products, wine, rice, and other foods. In addition, many industrial products are increasing in price daily without official announcement. Now, the price increases in Argentina are continuing to develop. Although prices are rising, wages are being frozen, and current employees are facing the threat of massive layoffs. This puts the Argentine people in an increasingly difficult situation, while merchants, plantation owners, and large business owners can freely raise prices and make a fortune. As for the abolition of various import restrictions and other measures in foreign trade that favor U.S. monopoly capital, as Argentine economist Fox has pointed out, this "will open the door to the inflow of foreign goods, and these goods will compete with domestic products."

The Frondizi government's "Economic Stabilization Plan" has aroused widespread opposition in the country. One of Argentina's largest bourgeois parties, the "People's Radical Civic Union," accused Frondizi in a special statement of "being the mouthpiece of the ruling political oligarchy closely linked to U.S. capital," saying that his government had abandoned its party's election platform. Former Argentine Economy Minister Morales said in an article published in "Clarín" that this plan "will lead to a serious decline in the country's entire economy and bring about widespread poverty. This will benefit large landowners, bankers, usurers, and, of course, large foreign monopoly capital." The Argentine General Confederation of Labor, uniting sixty-two trade unions, stated that this plan was "imposed by foreign capital providing enslaving loans to Argentina." In his report on the domestic and international situation at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party in January, the chairman of the Argentine Communist Party, Codovilla, pointed out that "this plan aims to impoverish the people further in order to enrich Argentine and foreign exploiters." He said, "This is a plan to plunder the working masses that previous governments have never dared to implement."

    屈从美国垄断资本压力的严重后果
    阿根廷经济进一步恶化
    物价急剧上涨人民生活日益困苦
    本报讯　阿根廷正在经历着严重的经济困难。今年1、2两月，各种食品和消费品的价格和公用事业使用费都急剧上涨，许多商品的价格竟上涨了两倍到三倍。阿根廷人民普遍展开了反对物价上涨的斗争，并且正在把这一斗争变成争取改善国家经济情况的全民斗争。
    阿根廷的物价飞涨和经济情况的进一步恶化，是弗朗迪西政府执行由美国控制的国际货币基金组织制定的“稳定经济计划”的结果。
    在弗朗迪西于1958年5月1日就任总统时，阿根廷的经济就已经处在危机之中。美帝国主义和阿根廷国内反动派就利用这一点向弗朗迪西施加压力。在这种情况下，弗朗迪西政府为了得到国际货币基金组织和美国银行作为实施所谓“稳定经济计划”的三亿二千九百万美元贷款，接受了国际货币基金组织提出的实质上允许美国干涉阿根廷内政的奴役性条件。这些条件是：取消比索（阿币）和美元的自由兑换率，大量裁减政府职员，冻结职工工资，限制罢工权利，取消对美国商品进口的限制，对内增加赋税，不再给国营企业以任何财政补助，缩减对社会主义阵营国家的贸易以及为外国投资造成“有利的气候”等等。这项计划完全是在美国的参与下制定的。弗朗迪西的“稳定经济计划”和国际货币基金组织及美国银行给予阿根廷的贷款是1958年12月29日同时宣布的，美国国务院副国务卿帮办墨菲吹嘘说，美国的这次“合作”，是一种“在拉丁美洲从未采取过的广泛的财政行动”。实际上这是美帝国主义进一步剥削和控制阿根廷的行动。这种行动已经给阿根廷的经济带来了极大困难。弗朗迪西政府并不掩饰这一点。弗朗迪西本人在2月19日发表的广播演说中也承认，“稳定经济计划”实行以来，苦难和穷困加深了。据他说，“目前的严重生活状态将继续下去……在改善这种情况以前，我们要度过一个物价上涨的时期”。
    弗朗迪西政府实施“稳定经济计划”的第一个措施就是从今年1月1日起废除阿根廷比索对美元的官方牌价，并从1月12日起实行比索新的统一自由汇兑牌价，这种牌价根据需求情况而决定。当时比索和美元的官方兑换率是一美元比十八比索，而自由市场的兑换率是一比六十八，这意味着阿根廷比索贬值三分之二以上。比索贬值的结果是物价的上涨，首先是进口货特别是从美国进口的货物的价格上涨，其他商品的价格也跟着上涨。在实施“稳定经济计划”的最初几天，阿根廷政府就把液体燃料的价格提高了二点七倍，把城市交通费提高50％到100％，铁路运输费提高了60％。从1月1日起，肉价上涨了33％，鱼价上涨了100％。从1月12日起报纸售价提高一倍。阿根廷资产阶级报纸“理性报”指出，在不到一年的时间里，肉类的价格上涨了700％。1月14日国家商务秘书处又公布一项决定，根据这项决定，厂主、批发商和商贩有权提高植物油、面粉、面包、通心粉制品、酒类、大米和其他食品的价格。此外，每天都有许多工业品不经官方宣布就提高价格。现在，阿根廷的物价上涨正在继续发展。物价虽然上涨，工资却被冻结了，现职人员又面临大量裁员的威胁。这就使阿根廷人民处于日益困苦的境地，而商人、种植园主和大企业主则可以随意提高价格而发财致富。至于取消各种进口限制和在对外贸易中有利于美国垄断资本的其他措施，正像阿根廷著名经济学家福克斯所指责的，这“将为外国商品的流入打开大门，而这些商品将同本国产品竞争”。
    弗朗迪西政府的“稳定经济计划”在国内引起了广泛的反对。阿根廷最大的资产阶级政党之一“人民激进公民联盟”在一篇特别声明中指责弗朗迪西“是同美国资本有紧密联系的执政的政治寡头的喉舌”，说他的政府背弃了自己党的竞选纲领。阿根廷前经济部长摩拉雷斯在“号角报”发表的文章说，这个计划“将使国家整个经济严重的下降，并且带来普遍的贫穷。这将有利于大地主、银行家、高利贷者，当然也有利于外国的大垄断资本”。联合着六十二个工会的阿根廷工会联合会的声明指出，这个计划是“向阿根廷提供奴役贷款的外国资本所强加的”。阿根廷共产党主席柯都维亚在阿共中央1月扩大会议上所作的关于国内外局势的报告中指出，“这个计划旨在使人民更加贫困以使阿根廷和外国的剥削者更加致富”。他说，“这是历届政府从未敢实行的对劳动群众的掠夺计划”。
