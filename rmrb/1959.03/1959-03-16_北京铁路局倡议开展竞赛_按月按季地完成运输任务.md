Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The 110,000 employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau have proposed a socialist friendship competition to all railway bureaus across the country to ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the 1959 transportation tasks, in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

The Bureau's planned freight tonnage for 1959 will increase by half compared to 1958, accounting for nearly one-seventh of the total national railway transport volume. Among these, coal accounts for approximately 38% of the total transport volume, making it the bureau with the highest volume of coal transport in the country. In February of this year, under the unified leadership, organization, and arrangements of the relevant provincial and municipal Party committees, all departments under the Bureau, through the efforts of all employees, over-fulfilled the transportation plan by 9%, and there was also progress in transportation order. Not satisfied with their existing achievements, the Bureau's employees, in order to complete the arduous transportation tasks to a greater, better, and more comprehensive extent, have put forward four goals to strive for and launch a friendship competition with railway employees across the country.

First, ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the state-stipulated material transportation tasks on a quarterly and monthly basis, ensuring the transportation of materials needed for iron and steel. In terms of passenger transport, safety, punctuality, and good service must be ensured.

Second, resolutely implement the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard" and the principle of ensuring priorities and taking care of general needs. In ensuring priorities, the first priority must be given to the transportation of iron and steel, coal, and key factories and mines. In taking care of general transportation, emphasis should be placed on planned, proportional, and unified arrangements, adhering to the principle of "external before internal." In the command and utilization of vehicles, resolutely obey the unified command of the Ministry of Railways in adjusting vehicles. Improve transportation plans, implement the Party's transportation policies, and conscientiously implement comprehensive transportation operation plans.

Third, fully utilize the operational effectiveness of locomotives and rolling stock. Starting in April, the turnaround time of vehicles should be reduced by 10% compared to the Ministry of Railways' plan, which can save more than 1,000 train cars per day; the daily output of locomotives should be increased by 10% compared to the annual plan. Strengthen the organization and command of train operations, establish normal operating order, and achieve 100% punctuality for passenger train departures and over 95% punctuality for arrivals. Achieve 95% punctuality for freight train departures and over 90% punctuality for arrivals.

Fourth, eliminate major accidents and strive to avoid general accidents and work-related injuries.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Railways believes that the proposal put forward by the Beijing Railway Bureau has a great effect on the comprehensive completion of this year's arduous transportation tasks. He hopes that the employees of railway bureaus across the country will enthusiastically respond to this proposal and jointly carry out the socialist friendship competition, so as to learn from each other, encourage each other, support each other, and leap forward together.

    新华社15日讯　北京铁路管理局十一万职工向全国各铁路局倡议开展社会主义友谊竞赛，保证完成和力争超额完成1959年运输任务，适应钢、煤、粮、棉大跃进的需要。
    这个局在1959年计划货物发送吨数，较1958年增长了一半，将近全国铁路总运量的七分之一，其中煤约占总运量的38％，为全国运煤最多的一个局。今年2月份，这个局所属各部门在有关省、市委的统一领导、统一组织、统一安排下，经过全体职工的努力，超额9％完成了运输计划，运输秩序也有了进步。这个局的职工不满足已有成绩，为了更大、更好、更全面地完成繁重的运输任务，他们提出四项奋斗目标和全国铁路职工展开友谊竞赛。
    第一，按季按月地保证完成并力争超额完成国家规定的物资运输任务，确保钢铁所需物资的运输。在客车运输方面，一定要作到安全、正点、服务良好。
    第二，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神和保证重点、照顾一般的原则。在保证重点方面，首先要保证钢铁、煤和重点厂矿的运输。在照顾一般运输上，要强调有计划、按比例、统一安排、坚持先外后内的原则。在车辆的指挥运用方面，坚决服从铁道部调整车辆的统一指挥。改进运输计划，贯彻党的运输政策，认真执行运输综合作业方案。
    第三，充分发挥机车车辆的运用效能。从4月份开始，车辆周转时间比铁道部计划压缩10％，每天可以节约一千多辆车皮；机车日产量比年度计划提高10％。加强列车运行的组织指挥工作，建立正常的运行秩序，旅客列车始发正点达到百分之百，到达正点达到95％以上。货物列车始发正点达到95％，到达正点达到90％以上。
    第四，消灭重大事故，极力避免一般事故和工伤事故。
    铁道部负责人认为北京铁路管理局提出的倡议，对全面完成今年繁重的运输任务有很大作用。他希望全国各铁路局的职工，热烈响应这个倡议，共同开展社会主义友谊竞赛，以便互相学习、互相鼓舞、互相支援、共同跃进。
