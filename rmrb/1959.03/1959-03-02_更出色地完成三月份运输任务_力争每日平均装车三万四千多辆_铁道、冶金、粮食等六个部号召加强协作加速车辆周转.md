Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: In order to uniformly arrange and deploy the March railway transportation tasks, and to mobilize railway workers nationwide, as well as transportation department employees of key industrial enterprises, to meet the greater battle of March, the six ministries of Railways, Communications, Coal, Metallurgy, Forestry, and Food jointly convened a national telephone conference on February 27th. Participating in the conference were leading officials from the six ministries, along with a broad spectrum of employees from railway bureaus nationwide and their affiliated stations along the lines, as well as leading officials and transportation personnel from metallurgical bureaus, coal management bureaus, food bureaus, forestry bureaus, commercial bureaus, and port administrations in various provinces and cities.

Yu Guang-sheng, Vice Minister of Railways, stated: This conference is a celebration meeting, a cooperation meeting, and also a great leap forward meeting and a mobilization meeting. He pointed out that as of February 26th, the national daily average of loaded railcars had reached 32,382, exceeding the daily average by 182 railcars. Passenger transport tasks were also completed exceptionally well, with an average of 1.65 million passengers transported daily, an increase of 550,000 passengers compared to normal daily transport. Yu Guang-sheng emphasized that this was the result of collaborative efforts between various railway bureaus under the leadership of local provincial and municipal Party committees, working together with fraternal enterprise departments.

Yu Guang-sheng then mobilized railway workers nationwide to strive for the completion of the March target of averaging 34,306 loaded railcars per day, building on the victories of February. He pointed out that March is the decisive month for fulfilling the first quarter's tasks, and the completion of the first quarter's tasks is also crucial for determining the completion of this year's even greater leap forward. Therefore, it is imperative to continue to exert full effort, liberate thinking, tap potential, and leverage subjective initiative, adopting various measures to ensure the overfulfillment of the March transportation tasks.

Lu Dong, Vice Minister of the Metallurgical Industry, stated in his speech at the conference that steel production is closely related to transportation. Therefore, he requested that all metallurgical units must strengthen cooperation with fraternal departments, and that all relevant departments, bureaus, factories, and mines must have a leading comrade personally in charge of transportation.

Xu Da-ben, Vice Minister of the Coal Industry, stated in his speech at the conference, that all mines should take measures to increase production, achieving a situation where whatever railcars arrive are loaded with whatever is available, loading as many railcars as arrive. To this end, the experiences of Beipiao and Xifuxin in accelerating railcar turnover should be thoroughly studied and promoted.

The leading officials of the other three ministries also spoke at the conference. They pointed out that for grain, it is preferable for goods to wait for railcars rather than railcars waiting for goods, so as to accelerate railcar turnover as much as possible. For timber, the loading capacity of freight cars should be increased. Transportation of freight cars and ships should also strengthen cooperation to accelerate the turnover of cars and ships.
