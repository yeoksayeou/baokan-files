	Wu Jinshan is the one who grows vegetables for our commune's canteen. He is sixty-two years old this year.

	Wu Jinshan has been in charge of this job for almost half a year. Regardless of frost, snow, sunshine, or rain, he gets up early and busies himself in the vegetable garden. Except for the three meals, all his time is spent on these few acres of land.

	The carrots and turnips grown by Wu Jinshan weigh over a pound each, and the greens, spinach, and chard are tender and plump. In addition to ensuring the daily consumption of the canteen, he has also made more than seventy jars of pickled vegetables and over a hundred jars of preserved vegetables, filling two rooms. Even Secretary Tang of the district committee knows his reputation and called on all vegetable growers in the district to learn from Wu Jinshan and catch up with Wu Jinshan.

	Wu Jinshan has a characteristic: he speaks very loudly, and if he encounters something he doesn't like, he will immediately point at you and scold you severely. Once, the cook, Li Ersao, was washing sweet potatoes and dropped a few that she didn't retrieve. Somehow, Wu Jinshan found out about it. He immediately picked them up, took them into the kitchen, and made Li Ersao's face turn red. At mealtime, he again said in front of everyone that Li Ersao was wasting food. Ersao knew she was wrong and was aware of his temper, so she didn't say anything. Who knew that he would get even more excited, and began to criticize everyone, saying that no one dared to speak up. The livestock keeper, Liu Laoquan, couldn't bear it any longer and interrupted him, saying, "Who doesn't dare to speak up? Don't sweep the whole yard with one bamboo pole. It wasn't us who wasted it."

	Wu Jinshan stared at Liu Laoquan and said, "Hundreds of eyes go in and out every day, didn't anyone see it?"

	"Who can see it when it's pickled in water?" someone said.

	"Wouldn't you know to feel around in the water?" Wu Jinshan questioned.

	Another time, Li Ersao's daughter, Jinhua, left her manure ladle on the field ridge and forgot to bring it back. When Wu Jinshan found it, there was already a crack as thick as chopsticks in it. After picking it up, he severely scolded Jinhua, saying that she didn't cherish public property.

	Wu Jinshan is good in every way, but there is one thing: if he hasn't seen it himself, he will never believe it.

	Last spring, the commune formulated a Great Leap Forward plan. The commune leader planned for a yield of eight hundred jin per mu, and everyone raised their hands in agreement, except for him, who didn't express an attitude. Privately, he said to his old friend Liu Laoquan, "After fifty years of being a farmer, for our fields to yield eight hundred jin per mu is like a toad trying to eat swan meat." The commune leader took this plan to the district to attend a Great Leap Forward conference. When he returned, he told everyone, "A fire has burned away my conservative thinking. I'll go all out and aim for a thousand jin." When Wu Jinshan heard this news, he didn't even attend the meeting that night and went to bed alone. After the autumn harvest, the commune's yield was one thousand and thirty jin per mu. At the celebration of the bumper harvest, Wu Jinshan finally admitted that he was an old feudalist and an old conservative.

	Last December, the team installed wired broadcasting, with the loudspeaker mounted on the doorframe of the canteen. At lunchtime, the team leader announced: knock off work a little early to listen to the broadcast. Wu Jinshan thought: such a small box, not even enough space for half a person to stand, how can it speak? As darkness fell, the courtyard was packed with people. Everyone in the yard listened intently. Wu Jinshan was still diligently hoeing his vegetables. After the first broadcast program was over, the team leader came over and asked him if he had heard it. See what he said: "I don't know what tricks you're playing?" He thought it was still Teacher Yang from the village elementary school giving a broadcast using local methods. Before he finished speaking, it started again: "Sichuan Opera, Nanyang Pass." This startled Wu Jinshan, because he had seen this opera, and at the same time he knew that no one in the village could sing it. He leaned on his hoe, rolled a cigarette, and listened while smoking. As soon as it was over, he carried his hoe and went to the loudspeaker, examining it carefully for a long time, praising it repeatedly, saying "I am an old feudalist and an old conservative," which made everyone in the yard laugh.

	Since then, Wu Jinshan has begun to change. The night before last was exactly the day last year when the plan for eight hundred jin per mu was set. The team leader conveyed that the commune had agreed to the team's proposed Great Leap Forward plan to ensure a yield of four thousand jin per mu and strive for five thousand jin per mu. The team leader said with confidence, "The commune has measured the yield of our high-yield wheat fields at over three thousand jin per mu. The plot by the river may even reach ten thousand jin. As long as we manage the spring crops well, fire the first shot, do a good job of deep plowing and manure accumulation, harvest a good crop of rice to fire the second shot, and then harvest a good crop of sweet potatoes to fire the third shot, five thousand jin will be within our reach..."

	Liu Laoquan rolled a cigarette, took a puff, and handed it to Wu Jinshan, asking, "Will the team leader's three shots hit the mark? What do you think?"

	"Add another shot, and we'll definitely achieve five thousand jin!" Wu Jinshan replied without hesitation.

	"The team leader has three shots, and you add one, that's four shots!" said Li Xingcai.

	"A fortune in every season," Liu Laoquan joked.

	"Don't interrupt! Let's hear what Wu Jinshan has to say," Jinhua's voice came from the corner of the room.

	Wu Jinshan took a puff of cigarette and said, "In my opinion, five thousand jin needs another shot. We have a lot of open space in our team. Plant soybeans on all the slopes and learn from advanced experience to build bean trellises. Plant buckwheat in all the ditches. If the water comes early, plow it under as fertilizer. If it comes late, we can still harvest a crop. Plant pumpkins everywhere in front of and behind the houses and around the edges of the yard, and build a gourd rack for each vine. Last year, we planted broad beans, and a few liang of seeds yielded dozens of jin. This stuff is very good. Plant it at the base of trees, and in the future, the whole tree will be covered with bean pods. It doesn't require extra labor or fertilizer, and it's guaranteed to have a good harvest."

	The whole room listened quietly to Wu Jinshan's coarse, loud, and sonorous voice, just like the first time they heard the broadcast that afternoon.

    吴金山

    吴金山是我们公社食堂种菜的，今年六十二岁了。
    吴金山担任这个差事快半年了。不管打霜下雪，天晴下雨，打早起来就到菜园里搞这搞那，一天到晚，除三餐饭外，全部时间都消磨在这几亩土地上。
    吴金山种的胡萝卜、大头菜三四个就有一斤，青菜、菠菜、牛皮菜又嫩又肥。他种出的这些菜，除了保证食堂每天食用以外，还做了七十多坛泡菜，一百多坛腌菜，摆满了两间屋子。连区委唐书记都知道他的名声，号召全区种菜人学吴金山，赶吴金山。
    吴金山这人有个特点，说话声音特别大，而且遇到不顺眼的事，当下就要指着你狠狠地训斥一顿。炊事员李二嫂有一次淘红苕，掉了几根没捞干净，不知怎样被吴金山发现了，他马上捞起来拿进厨房，说了个李二嫂满脸红，吃饭时，又当着众人的面，说李二嫂浪费粮食。二嫂知道自己理短，又晓得他这脾气，没有作声，谁知他越说越起劲，竟批评起大伙来了。说几百张嘴没一个敢讲。饲养员刘老全实在忍不住了，打断了他的话道：“哪个不敢讲，你不要一竹竿打一院人嘛，又不是我们浪费了的”。
    吴金山盯着刘老全道：“一天进进出出，几百只眼睛都没看见？”
    “腌在水里哪个能看见呢？”有人说。
    “水里就不晓得摸一下？”吴金山追问着。
    又有一次，李二嫂的女儿金花把粪瓢丢在田坎上，忘了带回来。吴金山发现的时候，已经裂了筷子那样粗的一道缝。他把它拣回来以后，就狠狠把金花训了一顿，说她不爱护公共财物。
    吴金山这人什么都好，可就是有一桩，没见过的事，他死也不信。
    去年春天，社里订跃进规划。社长规划亩产八百斤，人人举手赞成，只有他一个不表示态度。私下对他的老相好刘老全说：“五十年庄稼汉，我们这湾田亩产八百斤，真是癞虾蟆想吃天鹅蛋”。社长带上这份计划到区上开跃进大会，回来时逢人便说：“一把火烧了我的保守思想，一不做二不休，硬要干一千斤。”吴金山听到这个风声，当夜连会都没参加，就独个儿睡觉去了。秋收以后，全社亩产一千零三十斤。在庆丰收大会上，吴金山才承认他自己是老封建老保守。
    去年腊月间，队里安起了有线广播，扩音器装在食堂的门枋上。吃午饭时，队长通知：早一点收工听广播。吴金山想：这么小个匣匣，半个人也站不下，怎能说出话来。天快黑了，院子里挤满了人。全院的人凝神静气地听着。吴金山仍在密锄密锄地薅他的菜。第一个广播节目完了，队长走来问他听见没有？你看他怎样说：“我不晓得你们在装怪？”他以为还是村小学的杨老师用土广播讲的呢。话还未完，又响了：“川剧，南阳关”。这下可使吴金山吃惊了，因为他看过这戏，同时他知道村子里没有谁会唱。他撑着锄把，裹了一支烟，吸着听着。刚播完了，他就荷着锄头走到扩音器下面仔仔细细端详了好半天，赞叹不已，连说“我这老封建老保守”，说得一院子人都忍不住笑了。
    自从这次以后，吴金山开始变了。前天晚上，正好是去年订亩产八百斤计划的那天。队长传达公社同意队里提出的确保亩产四千斤力争五千斤的跃进计划。队长充满自信地说：“我们的小麦丰产田，公社测产都在三千斤以上，河边上那块，还可能达到一万斤呢，只要我们管好小春，打响第一炮，作好深翻、积肥，收一季好谷子打响第二炮，再收一季好红苕，打响第三炮，五千斤就拿到手了……”。
    刘老全裹起一支烟，吸了一口就递给吴金山，问道：“队长的三炮打得响么？照你看”。
    “再加一炮，五千斤准实现！”吴金山毫不迟疑地回答。
    “队长三炮，加你这一炮，四炮了！”李兴财说。
    “四季发财嘛。”刘老全打趣地说。
    “别打岔！听人家吴金山说。”屋角里传出了金花的声音。
    吴金山吸了一口烟，说道：“依我看，五千斤要加一炮。我们队里的空地不少，坡上的全点四季豆，学先进经验搭豆棚。沟里的全点荞子，水来得早犁了当肥料，来得迟拣到收一季。屋前屋后，院坝边边，到处都种南瓜，一窝搭个瓜架。去年点的胡豆，几两种籽就收了几十斤，这东西好得很，点到树脚下，将来满树都结豆荚，又不背工，又不背肥，包有好收成”。
    满屋人静听着吴金山那又粗又大又洪亮的声音，和那天下午第一回听广播一样。
