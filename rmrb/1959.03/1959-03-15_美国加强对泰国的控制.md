    The United States Intensifies its Control over Thailand

    In recent years, under the intensified control of the United States, Thailand has become an advanced base for the United States to expand its aggression into Indochina. Recently, from these two positions of Thailand and South Vietnam, American imperialism is further extending its interventionist hand to Laos and engaging in subversive activities against Cambodia, which is worsening the situation in Indochina and seriously threatening peace in Southeast Asia.
    Thailand is located in the center of the Indochina Peninsula, close to China's southern border. Therefore, Thailand has always occupied a quite important position in the U.S. imperialist plan to invade Southeast Asia. After the war, the United States ousted the British forces, which had always been dominant in Thailand, through the Thai coups it instigated in November 1947 and January 1951. In September and October 1950, it successively induced Thailand to sign the enslaving "Thai-U.S. Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" and "Thai-U.S. Military Assistance Agreement," thereby controlling Thailand.
    In September 1954, the United States induced Thailand to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and established the headquarters of this military bloc in Bangkok. Since then, U.S. imperialism has been using this land to deploy the military activities of this aggressive bloc. In recent months, SEATO, under the command of the United States, has intensified its activities to create tension. In the past month or so, up to the 8th of this month, SEATO has successively held two provocative military exercises in Thailand: the U.S.-Thai Army "Joint Atomic Warfare Exercise"; and a "Large-scale Air Force Exercise." In the latter exercise, the U.S. propaganda machine even attempted to portray China as a "hypothetical enemy," openly slandering and provoking our country.
    The United States also drove Thailand to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. Before 1954, the United States had transferred war materials through Thailand to the French colonialists in Indochina, the remnants of the Taiwan Chiang army in Burma, and the British army in Malaya. Thai newspapers at the time pointed out that the United States wanted to turn Thailand into a bridgehead against the Asian national liberation movement. After the Indochina armistice, in order to undermine the Geneva Accords and expand its aggression into Indochina, the United States further utilized Thailand and instructed Thailand to come forward to organize the so-called "Mekong River Three-Nation Military Alliance" and "Buddhist Nation Group," plotting to pull Laos and Cambodia into SEATO through Thailand. In recent years, the United States has intensified its aggression against Cambodia, using Thailand as a base. Last year, the United States instigated Thai and South Vietnamese troops to continuously carry out large-scale provocations against Cambodia, creating border incidents. The Thai government openly used means such as declaring a border "state of emergency," blockading and stationing troops on the Thai-Cambodian border, abolishing border passage agreements, and organizing demonstrations against the Cambodian embassy to threaten Cambodia. The Thai weekly "Fatherland" pointed out that the friction between Thailand and Cambodia was the result of U.S. intervention. At the same time, the United States also instigated Cambodian traitors hiding in Thailand and South Vietnam, as well as those lurking within Cambodia, to carry out rebellions. The two subversive conspiracy cases successively announced by the Cambodian Royal Government recently – the Sang Sarikou traitorous group and the Chong Mochoupich traitorous group – revealed that these conspiracies were formulated in Bangkok and Saigon. The rebels' weapons and funds were also transported into Cambodia from these places. Cambodian newspapers also revealed that the United States is organizing so-called "Thai Volunteer Army" in Thailand and South Vietnam to create tension.
    In the past eight years, the United States has given Thailand, which it considers "particularly important," more than 300 million U.S. dollars in "aid." Under U.S. planning and supervision, most of this U.S. "aid" has been used for building military facilities, expanding the army, and supporting U.S. military personnel and "experts" in Thailand. At present, the United States has expanded and built many modernly equipped naval and air force bases and large-scale barracks in Bangkok, Sattahip, Songkhla, Chiang Mai and other places in Thailand. In addition, the United States has also built many strategic highways in northeastern, northern, and northwestern Thailand, including the strategic highway from Udon Thani to Loei in northeastern Thailand, which is 50 meters wide and can actually be used for aircraft takeoffs and landings. Thailand's military strength, including the police, has been expanded from about 160,000 in 1956 to more than 200,000. The equipment of the Thai army is also almost entirely from the United States. In January of this year, more than 100 Thai army officers were concentrated in Bangkok to receive training in the use of atomic weapons.
    The United States has also established a military advisory group in Thailand. A large number of U.S. personnel have entered Thailand, infiltrating into Thailand's political, economic, and military departments under the titles of "advisors" and "experts" to seize power. At the same time, the United States has also secretly established intelligence organizations in Thailand, such as the "Southeast Asia Supply Company," a branch of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, to secretly train "underground armed forces," collect intelligence, and monitor the activities of the Thai people.
    While carrying out military control over Thailand, U.S. monopoly capital has been pouring into Thailand, seizing large amounts of materials and profits from Thailand every year. The United States also uses various means such as "embargoes," dumping, and price suppression to destroy and damage Thailand's economy, leading this country, known as the "Golden Peninsula," on the road to poverty. Under U.S. control, military expenditures account for a considerable proportion of Thailand's fiscal budget and are increasing year by year. In 1958, due to military spending still occupying the first place in the budget and nearly doubling compared with 1957, the budget deficit reached as high as 830 million baht. At present, Thailand's domestic and foreign trade is generally declining, many factories and shops have closed down one after another, the number of unemployed people has increased greatly, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly impoverished and miserable.

    美国加强对泰国的控制
    几年来，泰国在美国加强控制下，已经成为美国向印度支那扩张侵略势力的一个前进基地。最近，美帝国主义从泰国和南越这两块阵地出发，正把它的干涉黑手进一步伸向老挝和对柬埔寨进行颠复活动，使印度支那地区的局势趋于恶化，严重地威胁着东南亚地区的和平。
    泰国位于印度支那半岛的中央，靠近中国的南境。因此，在美帝国主义侵略东南亚的计划中，泰国一直占着相当重要的地位。战后，美国先后通过1947年11月和1951年1月它所策动的泰国政变，排挤了在泰国一贯占支配地位的英国势力，并且在1950年9月和10月，先后诱迫泰国同它签订了奴役性的“泰美经济技术援助协定”和“泰美军事援助协定”，从而控制了泰国。
    1954年9月，美国诱迫泰国加入了东南亚条约组织，并且把这个军事集团的总部设在曼谷。此后，美帝国主义一直利用这块土地来部署这个侵略集团的军事活动。近几个月来，东南亚条约组织在美国的指挥下加紧了制造紧张局势的活动。在到本月8日为止的一个多月中，东南亚条约组织已接连在泰国举行了两次挑衅性的军事演习：美泰陆军“联合原子战争演习”；“大规模的空军演习”。在后一演习中，美国宣传机器竟然企图把中国说成是“假想敌人”，公然对我国进行诬蔑和挑衅。
    美国还曾驱使泰国派兵参加了侵朝战争。1954年以前，美国曾经过泰国把战争物资转交给印度支那的法国殖民者、在缅甸的台湾蒋军残余部队和马来亚的英国军队。泰国报纸当时指出，美国要把泰国变为反对亚洲民族解放运动的桥头堡。印度支那停战后，美国为了破坏日内瓦协议和向印度支那扩张它的侵略势力，进一步利用泰国，又指使泰国出面组织所谓“湄公河三国军事联盟”和“佛教国集团”，阴谋通过泰国也把老挝和柬埔寨拉入东南亚条约组织。近年来，美国利用泰国这块阵地，更加紧了对柬埔寨的侵略活动。去年，美国策动泰国和南越军队不断向柬埔寨进行大规模的挑衅，制造边境事件。泰国政府曾经公然用宣布边境“紧急状态”、封锁和陈兵泰柬边境、废除边境通行协定和组织反对柬大使馆的示威等手段，向柬埔寨进行威胁。泰国“祖国”周刊曾指出，泰国同柬埔寨发生的摩擦是美国干涉的结果。同时，美国还策动窝藏在泰国和南越的以及潜伏在柬埔寨国内的柬埔寨叛徒，进行叛乱。最近柬埔寨王国政府接连宣布破获的两起颠复阴谋案——桑·萨里叛国集团和琼·莫舒皮叛国集团，揭露出这些阴谋是在曼谷和西贡拟订的。叛乱分子的武器和经费也是从这些地方运进柬埔寨的。柬埔寨报纸还揭露美国正在泰国和南越组织所谓“泰国志愿军”等来制造紧张局势。
    在过去八年中，美国已经给予它认为“特别重要”的泰国以三亿多美元的“援款”。这些美“援”在美国的策划和监督下，绝大部分都用于修建军事设施、扩军和供养在泰国的美国军人和“专家”等方面。目前，美国在泰国曼谷、梭桃邑、宋卡、清迈和其他地方，扩建和修建了许多具有现代化设备的海空军基地和规模宏大的兵营。此外，美国还在泰国的东北部、北部和西北部，修筑了很多战略公路，其中如位于泰国东北部的、由乌隆府到黎府的战略公路，路面宽五十公尺，实际上可供飞机升降。泰国兵力现在包括警察在内，已由1956年的十六万人左右扩充到二十多万人。泰国军队的装备也几乎都是来自美国。在今年1月间已经有一百多名泰国陆军军官集中在曼谷，接受使用原子武器的训练。
    美国在泰国还设立了军事顾问团。大批的美国人员进入泰国，以“顾问”、“专家”等头衔渗透到泰国的政治、经济、军事等各个部门中掌握大权。同时，美国还在泰国秘密设立了作为美国中央情报局分支机构的“东南亚供应公司”等特务组织，秘密训练“地下武装”、搜集情报和侦察泰国人民的活动。
    在美国对泰国进行军事控制的同时，美国垄断资本源源涌入泰国，每年从泰国攫走大量物资和利润。美国还用“禁运”、倾销、压价等各种手段，摧残和损害泰国的经济，使这个以“黄金半岛”著称的国家走上了贫困的道路。在美国的控制下，军事开支在泰国的财政预算中占相当大的比重，而且逐年上升。1958年，由于军事支出仍占预算中的首位，并比1957年增加了将近一倍，以致预算的赤字高达泰币八亿三千万铢。现在，泰国的国内外贸易普遍衰退，许多厂矿和商店纷纷倒闭，失业人数随着大大增加，人民生活日益贫困和悲惨。（新华社）
