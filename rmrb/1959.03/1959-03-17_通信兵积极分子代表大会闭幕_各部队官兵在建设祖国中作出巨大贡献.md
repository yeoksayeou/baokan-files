The conference reviewed the leap forward achievements of the Communication Corps over the past year, commended advanced units and individuals, exchanged and summarized experiences in combat and troop construction, and sounded the battle drum for achieving an even greater leap forward this year.

    During the conference, Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Kang Sheng, Deputy Chief of General Staff General Chen Geng, Senior General Peng Shaohui, and Deputy Director of the General Political Department Senior General Xiao Hua all spoke at the conference, encouraging everyone to achieve greater achievements in defending the country and modern construction.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th. The vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Communication Corps units, distributed throughout the country, have made enormous contributions to participating in the country's socialist construction and supporting the rural telecommunications construction cause.

    In the past year, from the Hinggan Mountains to the Pearl River, from the southeast coast to the northwest plateau, communication corps in various regions have supported the needs of the industrial and agricultural production front with a large number of communication technicians and communication equipment. In the Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shenyang areas alone, thousands of pieces of wired and wireless communication equipment were allocated last year to support industrial and agricultural production. During the upsurge of the mass steelmaking campaign, the Communication Corps erected telephone lines and radio stations for many steel bases. A certain unit of the Communication Corps in the Jiangxi area, in a fighting posture, rushed to erect telephone lines from the steel command headquarters in the mountainous area of Yushan and Qingfeng to various furnace groups, and was rewarded by the local government. During the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the suburbs of Beijing, a certain unit of the Communication Corps dispatched many technicians and a large number of telephones to build a wired command network for the construction site. A certain unit of the Communication Corps in the Beijing area also built a communication network connecting the flood control engineering headquarters and various flood control sections and important projects within a few days during the Yellow River flood control struggle last year, which played a great role in ensuring the victory of the flood control struggle.

    In the upsurge of the national rural communization, the Communication Corps happily erected a large number of telephone lines and established radio networks for the countryside. In the Beijing, Nanjing, Shenyang, and Lanzhou areas alone, the Communication Corps units erected more than 10,000 kilometers of telephone and broadcast lines for the local rural areas last year. A construction engineering team dispatched by a communication corps unit stationed in the Shaanxi area crossed more than 20 high mountains and ridges, including the Daba Mountains, within four months, and erected 1,300 kilometers of telephone lines for 80 townships in Ning County and Mian County, changing the backward communication situation in this mountainous area.

    新华社15日讯　分布在全国各地的中国人民解放军通信兵部队广大官兵，在参加祖国社会主义建设和支援农村电信建设事业中作出了巨大的贡献。
    一年来，从兴安岭到珠江，从东南沿海到西北高原，各地通信兵以大批的通信技术人员和通信器材支援了工农业生产战线上的需要。仅南京、武汉、沈阳等三个地区，去年就调拨了数千件有线和无线的通信器材支援了工农业生产。在全民大炼钢铁的高潮中，通信兵为许多钢铁基地架设了电话线路和无线电台。江西地区通信兵某部以战斗姿态，突击架通了玉山、庆丰一带山区钢铁指挥部到各个炉群的电话线，受到当地政府的奖励。北京郊区十三陵水库施工中，通信兵某部派出了很多技术人员和大批电话机为工地建成了有线电指挥网。北京地区通信兵某部还在去年黄河防汛斗争中，几天内就建成沟通防汛工程指挥部和各个防汛区段和险要工程之间的通信联络网，对保证防汛斗争的胜利起了很大作用。
    在全国农村公社化高潮中，通信兵欢欣鼓舞地为农村架设了大批的电话线和建立广播网。仅北京、南京、沈阳、兰州等四个地区的通信兵部队，去年就为当地农村架设了一万公里以上的电话线和广播线。驻陕西地区的通信兵部队派出的一支架设工程队在四个月的时间内，越过了大巴山等二十余座高山峻岭，为宁县、沔县的八十个乡架设了一千三百公里的电话线路，改变了这个山区的通信落后的状况。
