Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th: The suburban counties of Shanghai are actively expanding the planting area of early rice to strive for high yields. At present, commune members of the people's communes are stepping up the preparation of rice seedling fields, seed treatment, and accumulation and transportation of fertilizer. In some areas, double-cropping early rice has been sown ahead of schedule.

The suburbs of Shanghai have always focused on planting late rice. Last year, during the Great Leap Forward, the yield of early rice caught up with that of late rice, with a general yield of about 800 jin per mu, an increase of one time compared with the previous year. At the same time, the intermediate and late rice planted here are often hit by typhoons in July and August every year, affecting the harvest, while early rice matures early and has no risk. Therefore, this year all counties are actively expanding the planting area of early rice. Eleven counties will plant about one million mu of early rice this year, an increase of more than 400,000 mu compared with last year.

This year, the Great Leap Forward targets and measures for early rice in various counties have been fully discussed by the masses, and the "1959 Early Rice Cultivation Technical Operating Regulations" have been formulated. Songjiang County, a county that produced 1,000 jin of early rice last year, summarized the experience of large-scale high yields of 1,000 jin to 3,500 jin per mu of early rice after the harvest of early rice last year, and formulated this year's early rice technical operating guidelines. Now, counties are holding on-site meetings at all levels to promote advanced early rice cultivation techniques.

In order to fight the first battle of the first spring sowing crop, early rice, all counties have further strengthened their leadership over the current spring plowing production. In Fengxian County, more than 20 county-level agencies have moved to the people's communes to work, and more than 200 cadres at all levels, led by the county party secretary, have taken their bedding to the communes to be commune members, participating in production labor together with the commune members, greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of the commune members.

This year, all people's communes are advocating appropriate early sowing of double-cropping early rice to cultivate tender and strong seedlings, in order to promote early maturity and increase yield. In order to prevent the phenomenon of rotten seedlings, all localities are adopting the "moist seedling field" seedling raising method and preparing a large number of plant ash, straw curtains and other antifreeze materials. At the same time, meteorological posts are organized in various communes to forecast the weather in a timely manner so that measures can be taken quickly to prevent frost damage.

### 避免台风袭击　丰收更有保证  上海郊区扩大早稻面积

    避免台风袭击　丰收更有保证
    上海郊区扩大早稻面积
    新华社上海26日电　上海市郊区各县积极扩大早稻种植面积，力争高额丰产。目前各人民公社社员们正在加紧进行秧田整理、种子处理、积肥运肥等工作。部分地区双季早稻已提前下种。
    上海市郊区一向以种植晚稻为主。去年大跃进中早稻产量赶上了晚稻，一般亩产约八百斤左右，比前年增产一倍。同时，这里种植的中晚稻在每年7、8月份常受台风袭击，影响收成，而早稻成熟早没有风险。因此，今年各县都积极扩大早稻种植面积，十一个县今年将种植一百万亩左右早稻。比去年增加约四十多万亩。
    今年各县早稻的跃进指标和措施，都经过群众充分讨论，并且制订了“1959年早稻栽培技术操作规程”。去年的早稻千斤县——松江县，早在去年早稻收获结束后，就通过总结早稻亩产一千斤到三千五百斤大面积高产的经验，制订了今年的早稻技术操作纲要，现在各县都在层层召开现场会议，推广先进的早稻栽培技术。
    为了打好今年第一个春播作物早稻的第一仗，各县都进一步加强了对当前春耕生产的领导。奉贤县已有二十多个县级机关单位搬到人民公社办公，二百多名以县委书记为首的各级干部背了铺盖到公社当社员，同社员一起参加生产劳动，大大鼓舞了社员的生产热情。
    今年各人民公社对双季早稻都提倡适当早种，培育嫩壮秧，以促使早熟、提高产量。为了防止烂秧现象，各地采取“湿润秧田”育秧法，并准备了大批草木灰、草帘等防冻物资，同时组织各公社气象哨及时预报天气，以便迅速采取措施预防冻害。
