Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the Iraqi Asian-African Solidarity Committee, expressing warm congratulations and high respect to the Iraqi people for their successive brilliant victories in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of national independence.

The full text of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee's congratulatory telegram is as follows:

The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee warmly congratulates the Iraqi people on the successive brilliant victories they have achieved in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of national independence, and extends its lofty fraternal respect to the heroic Iraqi people.

In the recent struggle to quell the Shawwaf rebellion, the Iraqi people once again defeated those forces that conspired to undermine Iraq's national independence, interfere in Iraq's internal affairs, and attempt to subvert the Iraqi government. The Iraqi people have once again proven that by relying on the people and achieving democracy, they can effectively safeguard national independence and national unity, and unite into an invincible force. The victory of the Iraqi people has defended the fruits of the revolution and shattered various conspiracies of reactionary forces at home and abroad. Your struggle has won the deep sympathy and support of the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world.

The solidarity of the Asian and African peoples with the Arab people will grow stronger and develop in the common struggle against imperialism and for the attainment and defense of national independence. Although imperialism is resorting to all sorts of despicable means to create divisions among the Asian and African peoples, sowing discord and undermining their mutual relations, and continuing to carry out subversion and interference activities, today, with the growing strength of the forces of peace and the increasing awakening and unity of the Asian and African peoples, all the conspiracies of imperialism will surely be thoroughly defeated.

The Chinese people and the Arab people have always supported each other in the struggle against imperialism. In the past and at present, we have warmly supported the Iraqi people's struggle against imperialism and in defense of national independence, and will always stand with the Iraqi people in this common struggle. We firmly believe that the united and courageous Iraqi people, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, will overcome all difficulties and obstacles in their path and achieve even greater victories in the just cause of defending national independence and democratic freedom.

    祝贺伊拉克人民维护独立斗争的胜利
    新华社25日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天致电伊拉克亚非团结委员会，对伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立斗争中连续取得辉煌胜利表示热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    中国亚非团结委员会贺电的全文如下：
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈祝贺伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争中连续取得的辉煌胜利，并向英勇的伊拉克人民致以崇高的兄弟的敬意。
    伊拉克人民在最近扑灭沙瓦夫叛乱的斗争中，又一次战胜了那些阴谋破坏伊拉克民族独立、干涉伊拉克内政以及企图颠复伊拉克政府的势力。伊拉克人民又一次证明了，只要依靠人民，实现民主，就能有力地维护民族独立和民族团结，就能团结成为不可战胜的力量。伊拉克人民的胜利，保卫了革命的胜利果实，粉碎了国内外反动势力的各种阴谋。你们的斗争获得了亚非人民和全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的深切同情和支持。
    亚非人民同阿拉伯人民的团结，在反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的共同斗争中，将日益壮大和发展。尽管帝国主义在采取种种卑鄙手段，在亚非人民中间制造分裂、挑拨和破坏他们相互之间的关系，还在继续进行颠复和干涉活动，但是，在和平力量日益壮大和亚非人民日益觉醒和团结的今天，帝国主义的一切阴谋必定会遭到彻底的失败。
    中国人民同阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中是一向相互支持的。我们在过去和现在，都热烈支持伊拉克人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争，并将在这共同的斗争中永远和伊拉克人民站在一起。我们深信，团结一致和英勇斗争的伊拉克人民，在卡塞姆总理的领导下，必将克服前进中的一切困难和障碍，在捍卫民族独立和民主自由的正义事业中取得更大的胜利。
