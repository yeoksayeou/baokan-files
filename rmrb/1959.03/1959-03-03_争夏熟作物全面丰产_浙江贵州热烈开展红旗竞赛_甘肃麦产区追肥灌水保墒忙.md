Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. A mass campaign striving for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat and barley, 500 jin of rapeseed, and 10,000 jin of green manure is rapidly unfolding across the plains, mountainous regions, and islands of Zhejiang Province. The broad masses of commune members across the province are determined to work hard in the cultivation and management of spring-sown crops to achieve an even greater bumper harvest than last year.

In the Hangjiahu Plain region, Pinghu County took the lead in issuing a competition proposal to various counties in the Jiaxing Special District, aiming for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat and barley, 500 jin of rapeseed, and 20,000 jin of fresh grass from green manure crops. While issuing the competition proposal, the county mobilized all communes to conduct a comprehensive field inspection, categorizing all spring-sown crops, and formulating cultivation measures for each field according to the leap forward targets. They launched a five-barrier movement to overcome drainage, topdressing, pests, weeding, and lodging. Currently, communes, teams, and groups are engaging in red flag competitions with each other. Pinghu County's proposal received enthusiastic responses from various counties in the Jiaxing Special District, with many communes in Jiaxing, Haining, Anji, and Wuxing counties proposing specific targets and measures to participate in the competition. After Jianqiao and Jiubao Communes in suburban Hangzhou and Guali Commune in Xiaoshan County, and Changan Commune in Fuyang County jointly proposed launching a 1,000-jin wheat competition, twenty-eight communes, fifty-eight management areas, and one hundred and sixteen production teams in suburban Hangzhou and Xiaoshan and Fuyang counties responded to this proposal and participated in the competition. Currently, the members of these communes are carrying out crash programs to drain ditches, topdress fertilizer, and fiercely attack the wheat green-up barrier.

The 1,000-jin wheat competition is also being widely launched in the mountainous areas of western and southern Zhejiang and the Zhoushan Islands. In the Tianmu Mountain area, Jiande County put forward the slogan "Look at this year for three years, look at the beginning of the year for this year." At a recent on-site meeting convened by the Jiande County Committee of the Communist Party of China, commune cadres unanimously agreed that with hard work plus ingenuity, boldness plus care, even barren mountainous land can achieve high yields. Over 100,000 commune members across the county have been braving the rain in recent days to carry out spring drainage, topdressing, frost prevention, and pest control to strive for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat and barley. The Zhoushan Islands communes are conducting a three-check, three-compare competition between communes and teams, checking targets, comparing measures, checking progress, comparing quality, checking enthusiasm, and comparing results, using per-mu yields of 1,000 jin of wheat and barley, 500 jin of rapeseed, and 10,000 jin of green manure as the conditions. Over 100,000 commune members on the various islands are engaged in spring cultivation work.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. A red flag competition with the main content of seizing large-scale, high-yield wheat and rapeseed, and striving to achieve per-mu yields of 1,000 jin of wheat and 500 jin of rapeseed, has been vigorously launched in various parts of Guizhou.

This competition is being carried out between counties, communes, management areas, and production teams. In order to win the red flag competition, counties, communes, management areas, and production teams that challenge and respond to challenges have all carried out mass discussions and formulated practical and specific field management measures. After Dafang County proposed a competition with neighboring counties to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,500 jin of wheat, it immediately conducted a general field survey of wheat and rapeseed fields throughout the county, and quickly adopted measures to add fertilizer and water, eliminating category three seedlings in a short period of time. Xiuwen County, based on mass discussions, put forward the slogan "Give prominence to politics and encourage hard work, seize the wheat green-up period, quickly weed, topdress, and irrigate, and strive for a per-mu yield of double 1,000 jin," implementing a system of responsibility where cadres are assigned to areas and commune members are assigned to plots. The county has now universally topdressed wheat fields with 5,000 jin of fertilizer and added 5,000 jin of nitrogen-rich farm fertilizer to category three seedlings. In order to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests as early as possible, various people's communes in Sinan County are preparing to build native pesticide factories, and the county plans to produce 6.14 million jin of native pesticides.

In order to strengthen production leadership and ensure the realization of large-scale bumper harvests, a group of cadres has been transferred to communes, management areas, and production teams to lead production through production. Now, almost all bumper harvest dams, bumper harvest slopes, and bumper harvest ditches have county-level leaders stationed there to strengthen leadership. Twenty-five of the twenty-seven members of the Yanhe County Committee have gone down to communes, management areas, or production teams.

The entire winter in Guizhou Province was dry and rainless. Recently, there have been several days of rain and snow. The masses believe that this rain and snow has created favorable conditions for striving for even greater bumper harvests of wheat and rapeseed, and therefore their enthusiasm has doubled.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. In the winter wheat producing areas of Gansu, county Party secretaries are taking the lead, communes are fighting hard, and field management of wheat is being effectively strengthened, striving to get through the wheat green-up period and ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year.

This year, the people of the Pingliang and Tianshui Special Districts, the main winter wheat producing areas of the province, will strive to have 40% of the wheat fields achieve high-yield bumper harvests. Special districts, counties, communes, and management areas have all established winter wheat management headquarters, with Party committee secretaries at all levels taking the lead and dividing up areas to take charge of production. People's communes in the counties of the two special districts are all engaged in topdressing, spring irrigation, and compaction to conserve moisture.

The people of Pingliang Special District, where winter wheat planting area accounts for half of the province's total, have worked hard throughout the winter to ensure that 5 million mu of winter wheat have been well-fed, well-watered, and warm throughout the harsh winter. Now that the earth is returning to spring and the wheat has begun to green up, they are putting twice the effort into detailed field management work such as replanting seedlings, fertilizing, irrigating, compacting, carrying ice, and preventing pests. In the entire special district, there are more than 3.66 million mu of wheat fields with sufficient fertilizer (10,000 jin), and more than 2.4 million mu of wheat fields that have been compacted to conserve moisture. Wen County, a county with a per-mu grain yield of 1,000 jin in 1958, put forward the slogan "Work hard and skillfully for one hundred days to break through the 1,000-jin wheat barrier," and organized efforts to universally irrigate, topdress, and cover 130,000 mu of wheat with grass. Among them, 110,000 mu have been covered with grass twice, and 70,000 mu have achieved "two fertilizations" and "two irrigations," while more than 10,000 mu have achieved "three fertilizations," "three irrigations," and "three coverings." All high-yield fields are required to achieve "six irrigations," "five fertilizations," and "four coverings" to ensure many ears, large grains, and full kernels, striving for a per-mu yield of 3,000 jin.

The wheat management responsibility system established in the winter wheat producing areas of Gansu Province has played an important role in ensuring the safe overwintering of 10 million mu of wheat in the province. Wushan County, which was the first to implement the responsibility system, recently convened an on-site meeting to summarize thirty specific experiences, and put forward corresponding requirements and management methods for the main links of wheat greening up, strengthening seedlings, jointing, booting, and grain filling, according to the different natural conditions of various places. The leadership and professional teams for wheat field management have been strengthened and rectified, truly achieving "every road has a commander, every direction has a general, every plot has soldiers, everyone has a responsibility, and no point is missed."

    争夏熟作物全面丰产
    浙江贵州热烈开展红旗竞赛
    甘肃麦产区追肥灌水保墒忙
    新华社杭州讯　一个力争大小麦亩产千斤、油菜亩产五百斤、绿肥亩产万斤的群众性竞赛运动，正在浙江平原、山区和海岛迅速展开。全省广大公社社员决心在春花作物培育管理中大干一场，争取比去年获得更大的丰收。
    在杭嘉湖平原地区，平湖县首先以力争大小麦亩产千斤、油菜亩产五百斤、绿肥作物亩产鲜草二万斤的指标，向嘉兴专区各县发出了竞赛倡议。这个县在发出竞赛倡议的同时，发动各公社普遍进行了一次田间大检查，把所有的春花作物进行划类排队，逐丘逐片按照跃进指标分别订出培育措施，开展大破排水关、追肥关、虫害关、除草关、倒伏关五关运动，目前全县社与社、队与队、组与组正相互展开红旗竞赛。平湖县的倡议得到了嘉兴专区各县的热烈响应，嘉兴、海宁、安吉、吴兴等县许多公社都分别提出具体指标和措施参加竞赛。杭州市郊笕桥、九堡公社和萧山县瓜沥公社、富阳县常安公社联合倡议开展千斤麦竞赛后，杭州市郊和萧山、富阳两县已有二十八个公社、五十八个管理区、一百一十六个生产队响应这一倡议，参加竞赛。现在这些公社的社员们正在突击开沟排水、追施肥料、猛攻小麦返青关。
    浙西、浙南山区和舟山群岛千斤麦竞赛运动也正广泛展开。天目山区的建德县提出了“三年看今年、今年看年初”的口号，各公社干部在中共建德县委最近召开的现场会上一致认为只要干劲加钻劲，大胆加细心，山区土地瘠薄，也能夺得高产。全县有十万多社员连日来冒雨进行春花排水、追肥、防冻、防虫，争取大小麦亩产千斤。舟山群岛各公社正以大小麦亩产千斤、油菜亩产五百斤、绿肥亩产万斤为条件，开展社与社、队与队之间的查指标、比措施，查先进、比质量，查干劲、比效果的三查三比竞赛运动，各海岛有十多万社员投入春花培育工作。
    据新华社贵阳讯　以夺取小麦油菜大面积高产，力争实现小麦亩产千斤、油菜亩产五百斤为主要内容的红旗竞赛，已在贵州各地蓬勃展开。
  这场竞赛是在县、社、管理区和生产队之间展开的。为了在红旗竞赛中赢得胜利，互相挑战、应战的各县、社、管理区和生产队，都开展了群众性的大讨论，制定了切实具体的田间管理措施。大方县在向邻县倡议开展小麦亩产一千五百斤的竞赛后，立即对全县的小麦和油菜田普遍进行了一次临田普查，迅速地采取了加肥加水的措施，在短期内消灭了三类苗。修文县根据群众的讨论提出了“政治挂帅鼓干劲，抓住小麦返青关，快薅快追又灌溉，力争亩产双千斤”的口号，实行了干部层层包片、社员包块的责任制。现在全县已给麦田普遍追施肥料五千斤，还给三类苗多追了五千斤含氮较多的农家肥。思南县各人民公社为了及早防治病虫害，正在筹建土农药厂，全县计划生产土农药六百一十四万斤。
    为加强生产领导，保证实现大面积丰产，各地都下放了一批干部，到公社、管理区和生产队，通过生产来领导生产。现在，各地的丰产坝、丰产坡和丰产沟上，差不多都有县级领导干部在那里安营扎寨，加强领导。沿河县二十七个县委委员，有二十五个下到公社、管理区或生产队。
    贵州省整个冬季干旱不雨，最近，接连下了几天雨雪。群众认为，这场雨雪，为力争小麦油菜更大丰收创造了有利条件，因此干劲倍增。
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃冬小麦产区各县，书记挂帅，社社奋战，切实加强麦田管理工作，力争过好小麦返青关，保证今年小麦丰收。
    全省冬小麦的主要产地——平凉专区和天水专区的人民，今年要力争40％的麦田达到高额丰产。专、县、社、管理区都成立了冬小麦管理指挥部，各级党委书记挂帅，逐级划片包干指挥生产。两个专区的各县人民公社，都在大搞追肥、春灌和镇压保墒工作。
    冬小麦播种面积占全省一半的平凉专区人民，经过去年一冬的努力，使五百万亩冬小麦吃饱喝足、暖暖和和的渡过了严寒。目前大地回春，小麦已开始返青，他们又以双倍的力量投入了补苗、施肥、灌水、镇压、背冰、防虫等细致的田间管理工作。全专区追足万斤肥的麦田有三百六十六万余亩，经过镇压保墒的麦田有二百四十多万亩。1958年粮食亩产千斤县的文县，提出“苦干巧干一百天，突破小麦千斤关”的口号，组织力量，给十三万亩小麦普遍进行了灌水、追肥和铺草。其中，铺过两次草的有十一万亩，有七万亩达到“二肥”“二水”，一万多亩达到“三肥”“三水”“三铺”。所有的高产田都要求作到“六水”“五肥”“四铺”，保证穗多粒大，籽粒饱满，力争亩产三千斤。
    甘肃冬小麦产区建立的小麦管理责任制，对全省一千万亩小麦安全越冬起了重要的保证作用。最早推行责任制的武山县，最近又召开了现场会议，总结出三十条具体经验，按照各地不同的自然条件，对小麦的返青、壮苗、拔节、孕穗、结实等主要环节，提出了相应的要求和管理办法；加强和整顿了麦田管理的领导和专业队伍，真正做到了“路路有帅，方方有将，块块有兵，人人有责，点点不漏”。
