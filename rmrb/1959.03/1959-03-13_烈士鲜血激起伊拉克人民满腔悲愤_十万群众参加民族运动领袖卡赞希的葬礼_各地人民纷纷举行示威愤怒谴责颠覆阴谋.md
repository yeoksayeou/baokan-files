    Martyrs' Blood Arouses the Iraqi People's Full of Grief and Indignation
    100,000 People Attend the Funeral of National Movement Leader Kazanchi People in Various Places Hold Demonstrations to Angrily Condemn Subversive Conspiracies
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 11th. More than 100,000 people in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, today participated in the funeral of the famous national movement leader Kamel Kazanchi with grief and anger towards the traitors. He was murdered by the traitor Shawwaf in the recent Mosul rebellion.
    Starting at 1 p.m., Baghdad citizens crowded the streets around the martyr's residence to pay their respects and bid him farewell. Workers, farmers, students, and staff carried portraits of the martyr decorated with wreaths and banners, expressing their respect for the immortal peace fighter Kazanchi, and demanding the execution of traitors and conspirators.
    A car carrying the martyr's coffin covered with a huge Iraqi Republic flag led the five-kilometer-long funeral procession, slowly and solemnly passing from the North Gate of Baghdad through Rashid Street to Liberation Square, and then from there to the cemetery where the martyr was buried. The participating masses continuously shouted slogans, denouncing the despicable conspiracy of the traitor Shawwaf.
    The martyr's coffin arrived at the cemetery at dusk. Relatives of the martyr and representatives of the people were sent to the cemetery to bid farewell to the martyr. A representative in white read a eulogy. She read: The martyr Kamel Kazanchi, a peace fighter belonging to millions of people, is still alive, still fighting with the people, and the principles he fought for are still alive in the hearts of the people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 12th. People in various parts of Iraq have held demonstrations, angrily condemning the conspiracy to subvert the Iraqi government.
    In Kawi Baji, Kirkuk, about 30,000 demonstrators loudly denounced Shawwaf's treasonous conspiracy and his crimes against the People's Republic. Arabs, Kurds, Turks, and Armenians participated in the demonstrations.
    The masses in Erbil Province guarded their city on the night the conspiracy occurred, remaining on alert until dawn. As soon as people heard the news that the traitor Shawwaf had been suppressed, they held large-scale demonstrations.
    In Basra, tens of thousands of people also held demonstrations. In Ramadi, people held a grand parade in the early morning of the 9th, expressing their indignation and condemnation of the conspirators.
    The demonstrating masses unanimously demanded the execution of the traitors sentenced to death by the People's Court, the removal of all traitors and conspirators from state institutions, the arrest of all enemies of the Republic, and their dispatch to the People's Court for punishment, and the arming of the people's resistance forces and the masses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 10th. A commentary published by Baghdad Radio on the evening of the 9th said that in view of the various conspiracies of imperialism and Zionism against the Iraqi Republic, Shawwaf's rebellion in Mosul was not accidental.
    The radio station said that this recent conspiracy can only further prompt the Iraqi people to fight bravely and decisively. The radio station warned that the Iraqi Republic is determined to "resolutely resist all interference and ambitions, and is determined to fight imperialism and Zionism without compromise or hesitation."
    Iraqi Radio said that all the conspiracies and subversions of the imperialists will be destroyed when they encounter the rock-solid fortress of the Iraqi Republic. In the struggle against imperialism, Zionism, and all reactionary rule and autocratic tyranny, our republic will continue to be a loyal fighter for the heroic free Arab movement.
    The radio station emphasized that the characteristic of the Arab movement for freedom is that it makes imperialism afraid, because the purpose of this movement is to liberate itself from imperialist rule, to not ally with any imperialist groups or plans, to prevent all interference in their internal affairs, to establish an independent national economy through land reform and the development of industry, to improve the living and cultural standards of the Arab people, and to participate in strengthening the cause of world peace and security. Baghdad Radio said that all these tasks require the unity of the internal ranks of Arab countries. (Attached picture)

    烈士鲜血激起伊拉克人民满腔悲愤
    十万群众参加民族运动领袖卡赞希的葬礼  各地人民纷纷举行示威愤怒谴责颠覆阴谋
    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克首都巴格达的十万多群众今天怀着悲痛和对卖国贼的愤怒心情，参加了著名的民族运动领袖卡迈勒·卡赞希的葬礼。他是在最近的摩苏尔叛乱中被卖国贼沙瓦夫杀害的。
    从下午一时开始，巴格达市民就摩肩接踵地涌到烈士住宅周围的大街上，向他致敬告别。工人、农民、学生和职员们抬着周围饰有花圈的烈士遗像和标语牌，这些标语表示向不朽的和平战士卡赞希致敬，并且要求处死卖国贼和阴谋分子。
    一辆汽车载着用巨幅伊拉克共和国国旗覆盖着的烈士灵柩，走在长达五公里的送葬队伍的前面，缓慢而庄严地从巴格达北门通过拉希德大街到解放广场，然后从那里前往埋葬烈士的公墓。参加送葬的群众不断高呼口号，痛斥卖国贼沙瓦夫的卑鄙阴谋。
    烈士的灵柩于黄昏时候到达墓地。烈士的亲属和人民代表都送到墓地，向烈士告别。一位身穿白衣的代表朗读了颂诗。她读道：属于千百万人民的和平战士卡迈勒·卡赞希烈士仍然活着，仍然在和人民一起战斗，他为之斗争的原则仍然活在人民的心里。
    新华社巴格达12日电　伊拉克各地人民纷纷举行游行示威，愤怒地谴责颠覆伊拉克政府的阴谋。
    在基尔库克的卡维巴吉，约有三万名游行示威者高声痛斥沙瓦夫的叛国阴谋和他对人民共和国所犯的罪行。阿拉伯人、库尔德人、土耳其人和亚美尼亚人都参加了游行示威。
    埃尔比勒省的群众在发生阴谋的那天晚上，一直守卫着他们的城市，保持戒备直到天明。人们一听到叛国犯沙瓦夫被镇压的消息，就举行了大规模的示威游行。
    在巴士拉，也有成千上万的人举行示威。在拉马迪，人们在9日清晨就举行盛大的游行，表示他们对阴谋者的愤慨和谴责。
    游行示威的群众一致要求处决被人民法庭判决死刑的叛国犯，把一切叛国分子和阴谋分子从国家机构中清除出去，逮捕共和国的一切敌人，将他们送往人民法庭惩办，武装人民抵抗部队和群众。
    新华社巴格达10日电　巴格达电台9日晚上发表的一篇评论说，鉴于帝国主义、犹太复国主义反对伊拉克共和国的各种阴谋，沙瓦夫在摩苏尔进行叛乱并不是偶然的。
    这家电台说，最近这次的阴谋只能更加促使伊拉克人民英勇地、果断地进行斗争。电台警告说，伊拉克共和国决心“坚决地抵抗一切干涉和野心行动，决心毫不妥协、毫不犹豫地同帝国主义和犹太复国主义进行斗争”。
    伊拉克电台说，帝国主义者的一切阴谋和颠覆活动碰到伊拉克共和国这样坚如磐石的堡垒都将遭到毁灭。我们在反对帝国主义、犹太复国主义和各种反动统治和独裁专横统治的斗争中，我们的共和国将继续是忠实于英勇的自由阿拉伯运动的战士。
    电台强调指出，阿拉伯争取自由的运动的特点是使帝国主义感到害怕，因为这种运动的目的是为了从帝国主义的统治中解放出来，是为了不同任何帝国主义集团或计划结盟，防止对它们的内政的各种干涉，通过土地改革发展工业来建立独立的民族经济，提高阿拉伯各国人民的生活和文化水平，参加加强世界和平和安全的事业。巴格达电台说，这一切任务要求各阿拉伯国家内部队伍的团结。（附图片）
