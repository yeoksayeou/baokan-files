"Outline of the Tectonic Structure of China" to be Published

"Outline of the Tectonic Structure of China" will soon be published by Science Press. This is a monumental work including a tectonic map of China and its explanatory notes, with a scale of 1:4,000,000. It was collectively written by the Structural Geology Research Office of the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This book comprehensively synthesizes a large amount of geological data accumulated in our country over the past decade and preliminarily summarizes our country's tectonic research work. This work, with a volume of more than 500,000 words, not only describes the principles for compiling the tectonic map of China, the characteristics and developmental history of the various tectonic units divided, but also further elucidates the tectonic development of the entire China in various geological periods, including neotectonic movements. It also specifically discusses the magmatic activity of the strata in our country and the sedimentary development outline of the eastern region, and also divides and describes the metallogenic areas of our country's main minerals. In addition, this book is also accompanied by small-scale schematic diagrams of various kinds. This "Outline of Tectonic Structure" can not only be used to explain the history of crustal development and help geologists comprehensively understand the geological features of the motherland, but also serve as a necessary basis for compiling metallogenic prediction maps. It is of great significance for our country to compile a national metallogenic zoning map, has important guiding significance for our country's future prospecting work, and will promote further research and resolution of relevant tectonic problems in our country.

The completion of this work not only referenced the tectonic maps of the Soviet Union and its neighboring regions, tectonic maps of other countries, and the writings of many experts at home and abroad, but also received valuable assistance from relevant scientific research institutions and many experts and scholars in the Soviet Union. For example, in 1956, the Institute of Geology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences specifically organized Soviet tectonic geologists to discuss this book. In 1958, some Soviet experts and our experts jointly discussed the revision and supplement of this book.

    “中国大地构造纲要”将出版
    “中国大地构造纲要”即将由科学出版社出版。这是一本包括中国大地构造图及其说明书的巨著，图的比例是四百万分之一。它是中国科学院地质研究所构造地质研究室集体编写的。
    这部书全面地综合了我国十年来积累的大量地质资料，初步总结了我国的大地构造研究工作。这部容量五十余万字的著作，不仅对我国大地构造图的编制原则，对划分出来的各构造单位特征及其发育历史作了描述，对整个中国在各地质时期的构造发育概况也作了进一步的阐明，其中包括新构造运动在内，而且还专门论述了我国地层的岩浆活动和东部地区的沉积发育轮廓，对我国主要矿产的成矿区也作了划分和描述。此外，此书还附有小比例尺的各种示意图。这本“大地构造纲要”不仅可以用来说明地壳发展的历史，有助于地质工作者全面了解祖国的地质面貌，而且是编制成矿预测图的必要依据，对我国编制全国成矿区划图具有重大意义，对我国今后的找矿工作具有重要的指导意义，对进一步研究和解决有关我国大地构造问题也将起推动作用。
    这本著作的完成，不仅参考了苏联及其邻区大地构造图，其他国家的大地构造图，中外许多专家的著述，而且得到了苏联有关科学研究机关和许多专家、学者的珍贵的帮助。如1956年苏联科学院地质研究所曾专为此书组织苏联大地构造学家进行了讨论，1958年苏联的一些专家和我国专家又共同讨论了关于此书的修改和补充。
