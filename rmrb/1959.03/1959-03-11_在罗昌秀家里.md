    At Luo Changxiu's Home
    By our correspondents Zhou Zuyou and Wang Huandou
    In this season of warm spring, flowers blossoming, and the renewal of all things, we visited Luo Changxiu, the living "White-Haired Girl" of Yibin County, Sichuan Province. She is now a member of the Fengyi People's Commune in Yibin County, and an advanced producer in the entire county. Her husband, Wen Shurong, is a production team leader in the commune.
    Entering her home, we saw Luo Changxiu and her mother-in-law sitting around the stove. Luo Changxiu was feeding her newborn child, and her mother-in-law was making shoes. Luo Changxiu's originally snow-white hair is now turning blue, and her face is becoming fuller and rosier. She warmly offered us seats and brought out harvested peanuts and sugarcane to treat us. After a while, Wen Shurong returned, and while happily playing with the child, he enthusiastically told us about their happy life: Since they got married in 1957, they have often worked together, rested together, and studied culture together in the evenings. Last year, they accumulated more than 3,000 work points, making them the commune's "two full laborers." Luo Changxiu never knows fatigue in labor. Last year, although she went to the county town several times for meetings and medical treatment, she still earned more than 1,200 work points, which is more than most women. Last October, the commune members transported materials for the steel factory day and night. Because Luo Changxiu was pregnant, everyone kept it from her and didn't let her know when transport tasks came up. However, at the assembly, Luo Changxiu arrived carrying her carrying basket. Last autumn harvest, Luo Changxiu discovered that there was still corn and soybeans left uncollected in the fields. She immediately called her husband to join her in harvesting in the fields for two days, collecting two or three hundred pounds of soybeans and a lot of corn. She said, "They are all the commune's property and should not be wasted." Because of her active labor, she received a 50 yuan bonus during the Spring Festival, and both of them received double pay. Wen Shurong pointed to the new mosquito net, new quilt, new clothes, and new shoes in the room, saying, "These were all added in the last two years. We only lacked a child before, but now..." Speaking of this, Wen Shurong beamed and patted his son.
    "What's the child's name?" We all became interested in this question at the same time. Wen Shurong replied, "We named him 'Care'!" Grandma Wen quickly interjected, "It's all thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the care of the People's Government. Otherwise, not to mention having a child, our Changxiu would have died in the deep mountains and forests long ago. So we named the child 'Care'." At this moment, we looked around the room. On the gate, there was a bright red couplet: "Thinking of the past, we suffered hunger and cold in the barren mountains and wild forests; Looking at today, we have plenty of food and clothing, and a sweet and happy life." Yes, thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, people cannot help but feel happy for this daughter of a poor peasant who has experienced all the hardships of the world.
    On a rainy day, Luo Changxiu personally led us to climb Broken Head Mountain, clinging to vines and creepers, and with great difficulty, we found a cave halfway up the mountain. This is the cave where Luo Changxiu spent seventeen years of hardship. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, factories have been set up on Broken Head Mountain, and some people have advocated destroying the cave. Luo Changxiu herself asked to keep it. Yes, let it be preserved forever! It will make us cherish today's happy life even more.
    We climbed through the narrow cave entrance, and inside there was only a space of four or five feet square. Squatting on the ground, we would accidentally hit the top of the cave. The cave was filled with withered weeds and piles of wild fruit pits, and a gloomy, damp chill made people feel bone-chilling cold. Luo Changxiu told us that she was only a sixteen-year-old child when she was forced to Broken Head Mountain by the landlords and despots. Year after year, winter goes and spring comes, flowers bloom and fall, and she has been eating large mushrooms, wild fruits, chestnuts, grass roots... on the mountain. Sometimes, even these things could not be found, so she endured unbearable hunger. Whether day or night, she lived in the grass, caves, or under cliffs. The mountains were high and the forests were dense, and she often encountered poisonous snakes, wolves, and leopards. Later, her hair gradually turned white, and she had thought of ending her life several times. But when she thought of her elderly mother and six-year-old younger brother, and the family's grievances, she was determined to live bravely and fight on.
    After Luo Changxiu sadly recounted these past events to us, she said excitedly: I really didn't expect that I would finally see such a life today. She wanted us to send a message to Chairman Mao to say hello. (Attached pictures)

    在罗昌秀家里
    本报记者　周祖佑　王焕斗
    正当春暖花开，万象更新的时节，我们访问了四川省宜宾县活着的白毛女罗昌秀。她现在是宜宾县风仪人民公社社员，全县的先进生产者。她的丈夫文树荣是公社生产队长。
    走进她家，我们看到罗昌秀和她的婆婆围坐在火炉边。罗昌秀正给新生的孩子喂着奶，婆婆在做鞋。罗昌秀原来雪白的头发正在转青，她的脸庞也开始丰满和红润起来。她亲切地给我们让坐，拿出收获的花生和甘蔗，招待我们。一会儿，文树荣回来了，他一边愉快地逗弄孩子，一边兴致勃勃地对我们谈起他们的幸福生活：他们从1957年结婚后，经常在一起出工、一起休息，夜晚，夫妻俩还一起学习文化。去年他们一共做了三千多个工分，是公社的“两个全劳动力”。罗昌秀在劳动当中，从不知道疲倦，去年，虽然多次到县城开会和治病，但是，她仍然作了一千二百多个工分，比一般妇女干活还多。去年10月，社员们日夜为钢铁厂运输物资，因为罗昌秀怀了孕，运输任务一来，大家都瞒着她不让她知道，但是，集合时，罗昌秀却背着背篼赶来了。去年秋收时，罗昌秀发现地里还有玉米和黄豆没收干净。她马上叫丈夫和她一起在地里收拾了两天，拾来两、三百斤黄豆和许多玉米。她说：“都是公社的东西，不该抛撒了。”由于她劳动积极，春节时，她得到五十元奖金，两个人领得了双薪。文树荣指指房里的新帐、新被、新衣、新鞋说：“这都是近两年添制的。原来就缺少一个孩子，可现在……”谈到这里，文树荣眉开眼笑地拍拍儿子。
    “这孩子叫什么名字？”我们不约而同地都对这问题感到兴趣。文树荣回答说：“我们叫他‘关怀’！”文大娘连忙插嘴说：“都是共产党的关怀，人民政府的关怀。要不，莫说生孩子，我们昌秀都早死在深山老林里了。我们就给孩子取名叫‘关怀’”。这时，我们环顾屋子四周，大门上，一幅鲜艳的红色对联：想从前，荒山野林饱受饥寒苦；看如今，丰衣足食幸福生活甜。是的，想想过去，比比现在，人们不能不为这位曾经历尽人间辛酸的贫农女儿感到幸福。
    一个阴雨的日子，罗昌秀亲自引我们爬上断头山，攀藤附葛，万分艰难地在山腰找到一个岩洞。这就是罗昌秀曾经度过十七年苦难生涯的岩洞。去年大跃进以来，断头山上办起了工厂，曾有人主张把岩洞毁掉，罗昌秀自己要求把它留下来。是的，让它永远保留下去吧！它会使我们更加珍惜今天的幸福生活。
    我们从狭窄的洞门爬进去，里面只有四、五尺见方的一隙空地，蹲在地上，不小心会撞着洞顶。洞里残留着干枯的野草，和一堆堆野果核，一股阴森潮湿的冷气，令人感到透骨的寒意。罗昌秀告诉我们说，她被地主恶霸逼得上断头山时，还是个十六岁的孩子。年年冬去春来，花开花落，在山上一直吃着大脚菇、野果、丝栗子、草根……，有时连这些东西也找不到，她就忍受着难熬的饥饿。无论白天夜晚，她都住宿在草丛中、山洞里或崖壁下。山高林密，风暴雨大，常常遇到毒蛇、狼豹。后来她的头发也逐渐变白，她曾经有几次想结束自己的生命。但是一想到年老的母亲和六岁的弟弟，想到一家的冤仇，她决心勇敢的活下去，斗争下去。
    罗昌秀悲痛地向我们回述了这些往事以后，激动地说：我真没想到，我终归盼来了今天这样的生活。她要我们帮她带个信，向毛主席问好。（附图片）
