    The Lao Government Should Act With Discretion
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The Xinhua News Agency report published in today's edition of this newspaper regarding the various recent actions of the Lao Royal Government that are hostile to the Chinese people, further points out the severity of the current situation in Laos and Indochina.

    The facts reported by Xinhua News Agency prove that the Lao Royal Government is colluding with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's armed forces, condoning their use of Lao territory as a base for gathering, training, resupplying, and conducting armed incursions against our border. The Lao Royal Government is also providing the Chiang Kai-shek clique's remnant armed forces with supplies of grain and military equipment. At the same time, the Lao Royal Government is allowing U.S. imperialism to carry out hostile and destructive military activities against our country in Laos. Furthermore, Lao authorities have continuously carried out harassment and espionage activities against our country on the China-Laos border.

    These extremely unfriendly actions by the Lao Royal Government towards the Chinese people violate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the resolutions and spirit of the Bandung Conference, as well as the joint statement made by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, on August 25, 1956.

    It should be pointed out that the Lao Royal Government's actions to undermine the friendly relations between the two peoples and to betray the interests of the Lao people are by no means accidental. They are closely related to U.S. imperialism's new plans to control the entire Indochina region.

    Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its aggression against the countries of Indochina, exacerbating the tense situation in the region. It is attempting to turn the Geneva Accords into a complete scrap of paper, to drag South Vietnam and Laos into the Manila military bloc in some form, and to actively carry out subversion in Cambodia, thereby achieving its aggressive goal of controlling the entire Indochina region and threatening the peaceful and neutral countries of Southeast Asia.

    At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also actively instigating the Lao authorities and utilizing the remnant Chiang army troops to provoke conflicts on the China-Vietnam border, creating a pretext for further introducing military intervention from the United States and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

    In the U.S. plan to invade Indochina, Laos occupies a very important position. After controlling Thailand and South Vietnam, the United States is actively plotting to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, in order to isolate and further subvert the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and carry out provocative activities against our country. If the U.S. plot succeeds, the peaceful region of Indochina, created by the Geneva Accords and the efforts of the peaceful and neutral countries of Southeast Asia, will be completely destroyed, bringing new tensions to Asia. Therefore, all countries and peoples concerned about peace in Indochina and Asia cannot but face up to the current serious situation.

    The Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence and friendly neighborliness. As adjacent neighbors, it is entirely in the interests of the Chinese and Lao peoples to live together in peace, develop friendly relations, and jointly consolidate peace in Indochina. The 1954 Geneva Conference, the 1955 Bandung Conference, and the 1956 joint statement of the Chinese and Lao governments all fully demonstrate this point. Any behavior aimed at undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Lao peoples and endangering peace in this region is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and harms the interests of the Lao people. Our Foreign Minister Chen Yi has already issued a statement on February 18, expressing the solemn attitude of the Chinese government and people towards the Lao Royal Government's blatant attempt to abandon the Geneva Accords.

    The recent actions of the Lao Royal Government in condoning and colluding with the remnant armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out military provocations and encroach upon our border areas cannot but arouse the serious concern of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must remind the Lao Royal Government that it must immediately cease such actions that violate the joint statement of the Chinese and Lao governments. Otherwise, the continued existence of this situation and the consequences arising therefrom will not be beneficial to the Kingdom of Laos in any way.

    Will it fulfill the Geneva Accords and take the road of peace and neutrality? Or will it violate the interests of its own people, abandon the principles of peaceful coexistence, and continue to condone and collude with the remnant Chiang army, thereby bearing the serious consequences? The Lao Royal Government should be able to make a wise choice.

    老挝政府好自为之
    本报评论员
    本报今天刊载的新华社关于老挝王国政府最近以来敌视中国人民的种种情况的报道，进一步指出了当前老挝和印度支那局势的严重性。
    新华社报道的事实证明了，老挝王国政府勾结蒋介石集团残余武装，纵容他们使用老挝领土作为集结、训练、补充和对我国边境进行武装侵犯的活动基地。老挝王国政府还向蒋介石集团残余武装提供粮食和军火的补给。同时老挝王国政府还允许美帝国主义在老挝进行敌视我国的军事性的破坏活动。不仅如此，老挝王国有关方面也不断在中、老两国边境上对我国进行了侵扰和特务活动。
    老挝王国政府这种对中国人民极不友好的行为，是违反和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的决议和精神的，也是违反1956年8月25日我国周恩来总理和老挝王国首相富马亲王的联合声明的。
    应当指出，老挝王国政府这种破坏两国人民友好关系和违背老挝人民利益的行动，决不是偶然的。它是同美帝国主义控制整个印度支那地区的新策划密切相关的。
    最近以来，美帝国主义加紧了对印度支那各国的侵略活动，加剧了这个地区的紧张局势。它企图使日内瓦协议完全变成一张废纸，以某种形式把南越、老挝拉入马尼拉军事集团，并在柬埔寨积极进行颠复活动，从而达到控制整个印度支那和威胁东南亚和平中立国家的侵略目的。
    与此同时，美帝国主义还积极策动老挝当局和利用蒋军残余部队在中、越边境挑起冲突，为进一步引进美国和东南亚侵略集团的军事干涉制造借口。
    在美国侵略印度支那的计划中，老挝居于很重要的地位。美国在控制了泰国和南越之后，正积极图谋把老挝也变成美国的军事基地，以便孤立并进而颠复柬埔寨王国政府，威胁越南民主共和国和向我国进行挑衅活动。如果美国的阴谋得逞，将使得由日内瓦协议和东南亚各和平中立国家的努力所缔造的印度支那和平地区遭到完全破坏，给亚洲带来新的紧张局势。因此，一切关心印度支那和亚洲和平的国家和人民，不能不正视当前的严重局势。
    中国人民一贯主张和平共处，友好睦邻。作为接壤的邻邦，中老两国和平相处，发展友好关系，共同巩固印度支那的和平，是完全符合于中老两国人民的利益的。1954年的日内瓦会议，1955年的万隆会议，1956年的中老两国政府联合声明，都充分证明了这一点。任何目的在于破坏中老两国人民友谊、危害这一地区的和平的行为，都是中国人民所坚决反对的，也是损害老挝人民的利益的。我国外交部陈毅部长已经在2月18日发表声明，对老挝王国政府公然企图毁弃日内瓦协议的行为，表示了中国政府和人民的严正态度。
    老挝王国政府最近纵容和勾结蒋介石集团残余武装进行军事挑衅和侵犯我国边境地区的行为，不能不引起中国人民严重的不安。中国人民不能不提醒老挝王国政府，必须立即停止这种违背中老两国政府的联合声明的行为。否则这种情势的继续存在以及由此而引起的后果，对老挝王国是没有任何好处的。
    是履行日内瓦协议，走和平中立的道路呢？还是违反本国人民的利益，背弃和平共处的原则，继续纵容和勾结残余蒋军，从而承受其严重后果呢？老挝王国政府应该能够作出明智的抉择。
