A while ago, the Young Pioneers of the "Qemal Stafa" Eleven-Year School in Tirana had an unusual gathering at noon. The auditorium was packed, and the bright sunlight streaming in from the windows shone on the bright red scarves, making the songs and laughter even more lively than usual. Anton Kote, an Albanian journalist who had just returned from a visit to China, accompanied by representatives from the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth Union and the principal, walked onto the stage. The children watched in amazement as he opened a paper package and took out a piece of pig iron, a ball bearing, a toothbrush, a bottle of ink, and a pair of flannel toys – a kitten and a duckling. It turned out that these were products from the factory run by the Young Pioneers of the Changjiang Road No. 1 Primary School in Hefei, gifts for the Young Pioneers in Tirana, along with a letter written in calligraphy. When Anton Kote read the letter in Albanian, the applause and cheers were almost deafening. The letter concluded: "May we join hands and advance together, combining study and labor, and be good successors to communism!" The enthusiastic children stood up clapping and shouted in unison: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!!" for several minutes. The brigade committee member, Fleti Mërsi, went on stage on behalf of all the Young Pioneers to accept the gifts, and handed over their school's photo album and the children's own handicrafts to the Chinese journalist who was attending the meeting, asking him to take them back to China to give to the Chinese Young Pioneers.

Why did these small, not particularly valuable gifts cause such a warm response? One obvious reason is that they came from thousands of miles away, symbolizing the deep internationalist friendship between Chinese and Albanian Young Pioneers; but more importantly, it was because they were the product of combining study and labor.

Combining study and life has become the most resounding slogan in all schools in Albania in the past six months. The policy of combining education and life is leading Albania's education to a new stage.

The achievements of Albania's education are very prominent. Before liberation, more than 80% of the residents were illiterate, almost all residents in the northeastern mountainous areas were illiterate, and more than three-quarters of the villages had no schools at all. After liberation, the Central Committee of the Labor Party put forward the most important tasks in cultural education, which were to quickly eliminate illiteracy and cultivate native intellectuals. In 1946, the national education reform was implemented, and a decree on primary compulsory education was promulgated. By 1956, illiteracy among people under the age of forty had disappeared, and seven-year compulsory education began to be implemented. The number of secondary schools increased from eleven before liberation to fifty-one, and the number of middle school students was six times that of 1938. In addition, thirteen secondary technical schools and the first comprehensive university, the University of Tirana, were established. Now, on average, less than six people in the country have access to education. In August of last year, a national education work conference was held. The conference believed that the most important issue at present is to implement the policy of combining education and life put forward by the Central Committee of the Labor Party, requiring greatly strengthening students' concept of labor. Both teaching and learning must be combined with practice and serve production, especially natural science courses, in addition to teaching practice, they must go to factories and rural areas for internships, and some specific methods for participating in labor have been stipulated.

The policy of combining education and life was first implemented in various secondary technical schools. The reporter visited the Livestock Technology School in Shkodër and the Agricultural Middle School in Korçë. Since the second half of last year, these two schools have been vigorously promoting the combination of education and life. The Livestock Technology School stipulates that the first year has six months of physical labor, such as bathing cows, cleaning cow sheds, and feeding cows. The second and third grades also participate in related physical labor according to different majors. The Agricultural Middle School stipulates that each semester should have 20% of the time to participate in physical labor in state farms or agricultural production cooperatives. Each class is organized into a squadron, divided into small teams of ten to twelve people, with outstanding students serving as captains. There are also various quota requirements for students. The school establishes contact with production units, formulates specific plans, and makes appraisals of each student after the end of the internship for inspection as an important performance evaluation. The income from labor is handed over to the school to improve the students' own lives. According to the person in charge of the Livestock Technology School, when the new policy of combining education and life was first implemented, it was not without resistance. The vast majority of students supported it, but a few people disliked getting dirty and feared hardship, believing that physical labor was not their business. However, after the teachers first set an example and participated in labor together, the students' enthusiasm for labor generally increased. Some parents initially held a skeptical attitude towards the new policy. However, after the fact proved that physical labor did not hinder students' studies, on the contrary, their academic performance was better, several parents who had wanted to withdraw their children from school also said with smiles: "Combining study and life is really a good method!"

Ordinary middle schools and seven-year schools are also taking measures to implement this new policy. At present, all schools have their own cultivated land, generally one hectare for middle schools and half a hectare for seven-year schools. Every summer vacation, students and teachers have to go to the countryside to participate in labor for half a month to a month. The school's ball courts, courtyards, and various recreational places are also built by the students themselves. In these aspects, the "November 28th" Middle School in Shkodër has done the most outstanding job. The reporter made a special trip to visit when he visited Shkodër. This school has always had a tradition of valuing labor. In 1952, when the Lenin Hydropower Station was built in Tirana, they organized a voluntary labor team to participate and won the second-level Labor Medal. After the start of construction of the Marx Hydropower Station, even more people participated in voluntary labor. After the Central Committee of the Labor Party put forward the policy of combining education and life in the second half of last year, in addition to preparing to cultivate land and organizing students to participate in labor to beautify the school environment, they especially thought of some ways to combine with enterprises. They have studied which courses can be combined with which enterprises and how to combine them. Finally, they selected four units: an automobile repair factory, a tractor station, a handicraft cooperative, and a knitting factory as key points of contact, and signed contracts with them, sending teachers to the enterprises to give lectures and participate in solving practical problems in the enterprises; students above the tenth grade go to the enterprises for internships one afternoon a week, and students in the eighth and ninth grades intern in the school's workshop. At the same time, engineers from the enterprises are hired to come to the school to give lectures and guide internships. Now the relationship between the school and these enterprises is very close, many students have established deep friendships with the workers, and the school's workshop has also been greatly expanded with the help of various enterprises. Two new workbenches and sixteen metalworking practice tools were manufactured using waste materials. The principal led the reporter to visit each place, lathes, grinders, planers, milling machines, iron smelting furnaces, blowers, everything was available, and the parts made by the students were smooth and flat, almost all qualified products. Electrical engineering used to be a weak link. Although a research group was established, the effect was still not great due to lack of experiments. In the second half of last year, eleventh-grade students used some waste materials sent by the knitting factory and processed them with the help of the public utilities factory to install a gasoline-powered generator and establish a small power grid in the school, which solved the problem of internship and rapidly improved the quality of teaching.

Tirana is building a fairly large artificial lake. All students in Tirana - from the University of Tirana to the seven-year school - are participating in voluntary labor in batches and carrying out competitions. The construction site is close to the eastern suburbs of the city. The reporter went to visit on a rest day, but the long line of bulldozers, the roads trampled on the grassland, and the many piles of earth that will be used for the dam, can still make people imagine the tense and enthusiastic labor scene. Tirana's severe winter season is as warm as spring, with bright sunshine, and below the blue sky are the lush green grasslands and wooded valleys. This construction site is full of vigor everywhere. The policy of combining education and life makes Albania's education, like this construction site, full of vigor everywhere.

    阿尔巴尼亚教育的新阶段
    吴象
    地拉那捷马利·司塔伐十一年制学校的少先队员们，在不久以前的一个中午有一次不平常的集会。礼堂被挤满了，从窗口射进来的灿烂的阳光照耀着鲜艳的红领巾，歌声和笑语比往日更加活跃。刚从中国访问回国的阿尔巴尼亚记者安东·库特，由阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年同盟中央的代表和校长陪同走上主席台。孩子们用惊奇的目光，看他打开纸包，取出一块生铁、一个滚珠轴承、一把牙刷、一瓶墨水、一对绒布做的玩具——小猫和小鸭。原来这是合肥市长江路第一小学少先队员自办的工厂中的产品，送给地拉那的少先队员们做礼物的，还附了一封用毛笔写的信。当安东·库特用阿文朗读信件的时候，掌声和欢呼简直无法平息。信的结尾说：“愿我们共同携手前进，把学习和劳动结合起来，做好共产主义的接班人！”热情的孩子们鼓着掌站起来，齐声高呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！！”连续几分钟之久。大队委员弗莱梯·麦尔西代表全体少先队员上台去接受礼物，又把他们学校的照片册子和孩子们自己的手工，交给参加这个会的中国记者，要他带回国送给中国的少先队员。
    为什么这些并不贵重的小礼物引起了如此热烈的反响呢？一个显然的原因是它们来自万里之外，象征着中阿少先队员之间深厚的国际主义友谊；但是更重要的，却因为它们是学习和劳动相结合的产物。
    学习和生活相结合，近半年来已成为阿尔巴尼亚所有学校中最响亮的口号了。教育和生活相结合的方针，正在使阿尔巴尼亚的教育事业迈向一个新的阶段。
    阿尔巴尼亚教育事业的成就是非常突出的。解放前80％以上的居民是文盲，东北部山区几乎全部居民是文盲，四分之三以上的乡村根本没有学校。解放后劳动党中央提出文化教育方面最重要的任务是迅速扫除文盲，培养本民族的知识分子。1946年实行国民教育改革，颁布了初级义务教育的法令。到1956年，四十岁以下的文盲已经绝迹，开始实行七年制的义务教育。中等学校由解放前的十一所增至五十一所，中学生为1938年的六倍。此外还建立了十三所中等技术学校和第一个综合性大学——地拉那大学。现在全国平均不到六个人就有一个人在受教育。去年8月，召开了全国教育工作会议，会议认为当前最主要的问题是贯彻劳动党中央提出的教育和生活相结合的方针，要求大大加强学生的劳动观念，无论教和学都必须结合实践，为生产服务，特别是自然科学课程，除教学实习外，必须到工厂和农村去实习，并规定了参加劳动的一些具体办法。
    教育和生活相结合的方针，首先在各个中等技术学校贯彻执行了。记者曾访问斯库台的畜牧技术学校和科尔察的农业中学，这两个学校从去年下半年起都在大搞教育与生活相结合。畜牧技术学校规定一年级有六个月是体力劳动，给牛洗澡、打扫牛棚、喂牛等等。二、三年级也按不同的专业参加有关方面的体力劳动。农业中学规定每个学期要有20％的时间到国营农场或农业生产合作社去参加体力劳动，每班编为一个中队，下分十人到十二人的小队，由优秀学生担任队长。对学生也有各种定额要求，由学校与生产单位建立联系，订出具体计划，实习结束时要分别对每个学生作出鉴定，加以检查，作为重要的成绩考核。而劳动的收入，则交给学校用于改善学生自己的生活。据畜牧技术学校的负责人谈，开始执行教育和生活相结合这个新方针的时候，并不是丝毫没有遇到阻力的。绝大部分学生拥护，但也有少数人嫌脏怕苦，认为体力劳动不是他们份内的事。但是在教师首先做出了榜样和大家一起参加劳动以后，学生劳动的热情就普遍高涨了。有些家长，起初对新方针抱着怀疑的态度。但是在事实证明体力劳动并不妨碍学生的学业，相反的，学习的成绩更优良了以后，有几个曾经想让自己孩子退学的家长也喜笑颜开地说：“学习和生活相结合真是个好办法！”
    普通中学和七年制学校也都在采取措施贯彻执行这个新方针。目前各个学校都有了自己耕种的土地，一般中学为一公顷，七年制学校为半公顷。每年暑假学生和教师都要到农村中去参加劳动半个月到一个月。学校中的球场、庭院及各种游艺场所也要由学生自己修建。在这些方面，做得最出色的是斯库台的11月28日中学，记者访问斯库台时曾特地前往参观。这个学校历来就有重视劳动的传统。1952年地拉那修建列宁水电站的时候，他们曾组织一个义务劳动队去参加，并得过二级劳动勋章。马克思水电站动工以后，去参加义务劳动的人更多。去年下半年劳动党中央提出教育和生活相结合的方针以后，他们除了准备耕种土地及组织学生参加美化学校环境的劳动以外，特别在和企业结合方面想了些办法。他们曾经研究哪些课程可能和哪些企业结合以及如何结合，最后选定汽车修理厂、拖拉机站、手工业合作社、针织厂四个单位作为联系重点，和它们签订了合同，派教师到企业中去开讲座，参加解决企业中的实际问题；十年级以上的学生每周有一个下午到企业中去实习，八、九年级学生则在学校的手工场中实习。同时，又聘请企业中的工程师来学校讲课，指导实习。现在学校和这几个企业的关系非常密切，许多学生已经和工人建立了深厚的友谊，学校的手工场在各企业帮助下也大大扩充了。利用废料加工新制了两个工作台，十六部进行金属实习的工具。校长引导记者一处一处去参观，镟床、磨床、刨床、铣床、炼铁炉、鼓风机什么都有，而学生做出来的那些零件，也都光滑平整，几乎全是合格品。电气学过去是个薄弱环节，虽然建立了研究小组，但是因为缺少实验，效果仍然不大。去年下半年十一年级学生利用针织厂送的一些废料，在公用事业厂帮助加工后，安装了一部用汽油发动的发电机，建立了学校中的小发电网，实习问题解决了，教学质量也迅速提高了。
    地拉那正在修建一个规模相当大的人工湖。地拉那的全体学生——从地拉那大学到七年制学校的学生都分批参加义务劳动，并开展了竞赛。工地紧靠城市东郊，记者去访问时不巧正是个休息日，但是那一列长长的推土车，草地上被踏开的道路和将来作堤坝的那许多土堆，仍然可以使人想见那紧张热烈的劳动场面。地拉那严冬季节也和春天一样温暖，阳光明亮，蓝天之下是嫩绿的草地和树木葱郁的山谷，这个工地无处不洋溢着蓬勃的生气。教育与生活相结合的方针，使阿尔巴尼亚的教育事业也和这工地一样，无处不洋溢着蓬勃的生气。
