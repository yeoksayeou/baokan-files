Liaoning Tussah Silkworm Seeds Spread Throughout the Country

    (Our report) Liaoning Province is the main tussah silkworm cocoon producing area in China, with its annual output accounting for 65%—85% of the country's total. Every year, a large number of seed cocoons are supplied to all parts of the country. With the Great Leap Forward in tussah silkworm production, Liaoning has greatly increased the supply of tussah silkworm seed cocoons to various regions. This year, in addition to supplying the seed cocoons needed by the province, Liaoning has also met the requirements of sixteen provinces (regions), supplying 1.2 billion seed grains, an increase of about seven times compared with last year. Provinces such as Yunnan and Guangdong, which had never raised tussah silkworms before, have also imported tussah silkworm seeds from Liaoning this year and started trial breeding.

    辽宁柞蚕种遍及全国
    本报讯　辽宁省是我国柞蚕茧生产的主要产区，常年产量占全国总产量的65％—85％，每年都有大量种茧供应全国各地。随着柞蚕生产大跃进，辽宁对各地的柞蚕种茧的供应数量也大大增加了。今年辽宁除供应本省需要的种茧外，并满足了十六个省（区）的要求，供应了种茧十二亿粒，比去年增加了七倍左右。过去从没有养过柞蚕的云南、广东等省，今年也都从辽宁引进了柞蚕种，开始试养。
