    Iraqi Honey Dates

    Recently, Iraqi honey dates have been widely sold in cooperatives and food stores in Beijing. Everyone who has tasted these dates praises their flavor.

    People call them "honey dates," but they are actually different from our honey dates. However, these dates have a large amount of natural sugar, much like our golden thread honey dates, so calling them honey dates is quite appropriate.

    Although the shape of Iraqi honey dates is similar to our dates, they are not the fruit of the jujube tree. Our jujube tree is a plant of the Rhamnaceae Ziziphus genus, while the plant that produces these honey dates is a plant of the Palmaceae Phoenix genus. Apart from the shape of the fruit, there is nothing in common between the two.

    This plant is usually translated as date palm, and the fruit is translated as date palm fruit. I think a simpler way is to translate the tree name as date palm (a coconut tree that bears dates), and the fruit name as coconut date (dates borne by coconut trees). This is our national style. The relationship between "date palm" and "coconut date" is just like the relationship between "honeybee" and "honey," and "dairy cow" and "milk," all of which are simple and clear.

    The date palm is a special plant that is abundantly produced in West Asian and North African Arab countries. It is an evergreen tree, with a trunk height of 40-50 feet to 70-80 feet. The top of the tree has more than 50 pinnate compound leaves, each leaf being six to seven feet to eight to nine feet long. The flowers are unisexual, with female and male flowers on different plants, like our ginkgo tree, but date palms require artificial pollination. If only a female tree is planted, although it can flower and bear fruit, the fruit will be seedless, fall off before it is ripe, and the taste will be raw and astringent, making it almost inedible.

    The fruit of the date palm is a multiple fruit, with more than 100 fruits on each small branch. The fruit is a berry. The pit of the fruit is like a silkworm chrysalis, with both ends not pointed, double-rolled and round, with a small groove in the middle. The texture is firm and not easily broken.

    The date palm is the most useful plant in desert areas. The fruit is the most common and nutritious fruit. Coconut dates and milk are the most important foods for nomads. Besides camel meat, coconut dates are their only staple food. The wood can be used for construction, the grown leaves can be woven into baskets and hampers, the branches can be split to make various utensils, the sap leached from the trunk can be made into sugar, and can also be used to make wine. Coconut dates soaked in water until fermented become the beverage sought after by Arabs - date liquor (Nabidh). Ground date pits can be used as camel feed. It is said that Muhammad once instructed the Arabs: "You should respect your great-aunt - the date palm, because it and the ancestor of mankind, Adam, were made of the same soil." There are many kinds of date palms. Arab writers have made statistics, and there are as many as 100 kinds of date palms in Medina alone.

    Arab countries all grow date palms, and date palm forests are a unique landscape of Arab countries. Iraqi coconut dates are of high quality and high yield, with an average annual export of 200,000 tons. Therefore, Iraq is the world's largest exporter of coconut dates.

    Our country has ordered 20,000 tons of coconut dates from Iraq, worth more than 500,000 dinars (Iraqi gold pounds). The Iraqi Ministry of Economy issued a statement saying that China's purchase of this batch of coconut dates will improve the status and market conditions of Iraqi coconut dates, thereby helping to improve the living standards of Iraqi farmers. Our people can eat such precious coconut dates, and we cannot but thank our Iraqi farmer brothers.

    After the victory of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of the Iraqi people, the traditional friendly relations between the people of China and Iraq since the Tang and Song Dynasties have been restored and developed. Now that we eat Iraqi honey dates, we recall the various records of this kind of date in our ancient books. As early as the early years of Bao Ying in the Tang Dynasty (762 AD), Du Huan wrote a travelogue after returning to the motherland from Iraq (the Great Food Kingdom), describing the customs and conditions of the Great Food Kingdom, and recorded the name of coconut dates. His uncle Du You wrote Tongdian, which quoted his article, saying that in the Arab region "horses eat dried fish, and people eat Manghu. Mang is the Persian date." (Volume 193) The New Book of Tang also says: "Horses are fed with dried fish, and people eat Humang. Humang is the Persian date." (Volume 221, Part 2)

    As early as the Tang Dynasty, Arabs had already brought coconut dates to our country as gifts to the Chinese emperors.

    The most ancient record of date palms in our country is probably Duan Chengshi's "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" in the Tang Dynasty. He said: "Persian dates come from Persia. Persia calls it the Kumang tree. It is three or four zhang tall and five or six chi in circumference. The leaves are like Tudou vines and do not fade. Flowers are born in February, shaped like banana flowers, with two armor, gradually opening, with more than ten chambers inside. The fruit is two inches long, yellow-white, with a pit, and the ripe fruit is black, shaped like dried dates, and tastes as sweet as maltose." The second most detailed record is Tao Jiucheng's "Notes from Retirement" in the Yuan Dynasty. He said: "In front of the Jiangdu Temple in Chengdu Prefecture, there are six trees, which have been passed down since the Han and Tang Dynasties. The trees are five or six zhang tall, about three or four xun in circumference, straight as arrows, without other branches, and branches and leaves are only born on the top, like palm trees, the bark is like dragon scales, the leaves are like phoenix tails, and the fruit is like a date but larger. Every year in mid-winter, the officials prepare sacrifices and then pick them. Gold drums and guards welcome them into the official residence. Doctors and craftsmen are selected to scrape off the green skin of each fruit with a knife, blanch it in lime soup, cook it, and soak it in cold honey for five or seven days. Take it out, drain it, and replace it with cooked honey. Repeat this three or four times, then put it into bottles and jars, seal it and present it. If it is not treated like this, it will be raw and astringent and inedible. There are three ten-thousand-year date trees in Quanzhou, and those who know say that they are the golden fruits of Sichuan. The foreigners call it Kulumazao, which is the phoenix-tail banana." (Volume 27)

    The lifespan of date palms is very long, so there are names such as thousand-year dates (Kai Bao Materia Medica), ten-thousand-year dates (Notes from Retirement), and ten-thousand-year-old dates (Comprehensive Records) in our ancient books.

    Coconut dates are not only a highly nutritious food, but also have significant medicinal uses. Taste: sweet, warm, non-toxic. Indications: tonifies deficiency and fatigue, calms the mind, treats timidity like magic. Promotes digestion and broadens the middle, eliminates phlegm and relieves cough; benefits qi and moisturizes the complexion, long-term consumption makes people fat and beautiful. This is something that we should study carefully today.

    People eat Iraqi honey dates, regardless of men, women, old or young, all with a special feeling. "This is Iraqi honey date!" This sentence not only contains praise, but also contains a kind of excitement, a kind of heart-to-heart affection!

    伊拉克蜜枣
    马坚
    最近北京市各合作社和食品商店，到处发售伊拉克蜜枣。凡是吃过这种枣子的人，都称赞这种枣子的味道。
    人们叫它们“蜜枣”，其实它们同我们的蜜枣并不一样。但这种枣子具有大量的天然糖分，很像我国的金丝蜜枣，叫做蜜枣是恰如其分的。
    伊拉克蜜枣的形状虽然与我国枣子相似，但并不是枣树的果实。我国的枣树是鼠李科枣属植物，而生产这种蜜枣的是棕榈科战捷木属植物，除果实的形状外，二者之间毫无共同之处。
    这种植物，通常把树名译成枣椰，把果实名译成枣椰子。我认为比较简便的方法是把树名译成枣椰（会结枣的椰子树），把果实名译成椰枣（椰子树所结的枣子）。这是我国的民族形式，“枣椰”和“椰枣”的关系，正如“蜜蜂”和“蜂蜜”、“奶牛”和“牛奶”的关系一样，都是简单明白的。
    枣椰是盛产于西亚和北非阿拉伯国家的特区植物，是一种常绿乔木，干高四、五丈到七、八丈。树顶生羽状复叶五十多片，每片长六、七尺到八、九尺。花是单性花，雌花与雄花异株，像我国的白果树一样，但枣椰需要人工授粉。如果只种一棵雌树，虽能开花结果，但是果内无核，不成熟就掉下来，而且味道生涩，简直不能吃。
    枣椰的果实是复果，每小枝结果百枚以上，果实是浆果。果核像蚕蛹，两头不尖，双卷而圆，中间有一条小沟，质地坚实，不易砸破。
    枣椰在沙漠地区是最有用的植物。果实是最普通、而且最富于养料的水果。椰枣和奶子是游牧人最重要的食品，除驼肉外，椰枣是他们唯一的定形食物。木材可供建筑之用，已成长的树叶可以编成篮子和筐子，树枝可以劈开来编成各种用具，由树干浸出的汁液可以制成砂糖，还可以制酒。椰枣泡在水里，泡到发酵，就成为阿拉伯人所追求的饮料——枣醴（Nabidh）。枣核磨碎后可以做骆驼的饲料。相传穆罕默德曾嘱咐阿拉伯人说：“你们应该尊重你们的姑祖母——枣椰，因为它和人祖阿丹（亚当），是用同样的泥土造成的。”枣椰的种类很多，阿拉伯的著作家曾做过统计，仅仅麦地那的枣椰就有一百种。
    阿拉伯国家都种枣椰，枣椰林是阿拉伯国家特有的风光。伊拉克的椰枣，质量高，产量大，每年平均输出二十万吨，因此，伊拉克是世界上最大的椰枣输出国家。
    我国向伊拉克订购两万吨椰枣，价值超过五十万第纳尔（伊拉克金镑）。伊拉克经济部发表声明说，中国购买这批椰枣，将改善伊拉克椰枣的地位和市场情况，从而有助于改善伊拉克农民的生活水平。我国人民能够吃到这样名贵的椰枣，不能不感谢伊拉克的农民弟兄。
    伊拉克人民反帝反封建的革命获得胜利后，中伊两国人民之间自唐宋以来的传统友谊关系，获得了恢复和发展。现在我们吃到伊拉克蜜枣，就回忆起我国典籍中关于这种枣子的种种记载。远在唐朝宝应初年（公元762年），杜环从伊拉克（大食国）返回祖国后，撰写经行记，叙述大食国的风土人情，对于椰枣的名称就有了记载。他叔父杜佑著通典，曾引用他的文章，说阿拉伯地方“马食干鱼，人餐莽鹘。莽，即波斯枣也。”（卷193）新唐书也说：“饲马以槁鱼，人食鹘莽。鹘莽，波斯枣也。”（卷221下）
    远在唐朝时候，阿拉伯人早已把椰枣带到我国来，作为礼物，献给中国皇帝。
    我国关于枣椰的记载，大概以唐朝段成式的“酉阳杂俎”为最古，他说：“波斯枣出波斯国，波斯国呼为窟莽树。长三四丈，围五六尺。叶似土藤，不雕。二月生花，状如蕉花，有两甲，渐渐开罅，中有十余房。子长二寸，黄白色，有核，熟则子黑，状类干枣，味甘如饧。”其次要推元朝陶九成的“辍耕录”为最详尽，他说：“成都府江渎庙前，有树六株，世传汉唐以来即有之。其树高可五六丈，围约三四寻，挺直如矢，无他柯干，顶上才生枝叶，若棕榈状，皮如龙鳞，叶如凤尾，实如枣而加大。每岁仲冬，有司具牲馔祭毕，然后采摘。金鼓仪卫，迎入公廨。差点医工，以刀逐果刮去青皮，石灰汤焯过，入熬熟，冷蜜浸五七日，漉起控干，再换熟蜜。如此三四次，却入瓶缶，封贮进献。不如此修制，则生涩不可食。泉州万年枣三株，识者谓即四川金果也。番中名为苦鲁麻枣，盖凤尾蕉也。”（卷27）
    枣椰的寿命很长，故我国典籍中有千年枣（开宝本草）万年枣（辍耕录）、万岁枣（一统志）的名称。
    椰枣不仅是营养价值很高的食品，而且在医疗上有重大的功用。气味：甘、温、无毒。主治：补虚劳，定神志，治怯如神。消食宽中，除痰止嗽；益气润颜，久食令人肥美。这是值得我们今天好好地加以研究的。
    人们吃着伊拉克蜜枣，无论男女老幼，都怀着一种特殊的心情。“这是伊拉克蜜枣呀！”这句话，不仅含着赞美，也含有一种兴奋，一种心心相连的情谊！
