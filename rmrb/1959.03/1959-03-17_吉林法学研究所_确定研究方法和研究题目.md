The Jilin Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Jilin Branch, which began preparations for establishment in November of last year, has recently begun scientific research activities. In terms of research methods, in order to implement the principle of integrating theory with practice, systematic and comprehensive theoretical research and summarization are conducted on the one hand, and research on current local specific issues is planned on the other. Regarding the former task, the aim is to use the viewpoint of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages to elucidate the characteristics of class struggle in various stages of the Chinese revolution, and in connection with the political, economic, and ideological conditions of the time, to find the material basis for policy formation and its promoting role in social development from the aspects of social development laws and class struggle laws, so as to summarize guiding experiences and lessons, and achieve the goal of serving politics through legal research. To this end, they have tentatively formulated the following research topics: "On the Laws and Characteristics of Legal Development in Various Periods of the Chinese Revolution," "Research on the Theory of Chinese Law," "On Marriage and Family Systems in Various Stages of the Chinese Revolution," "Development of Methods, Strategies, and Organizational Forms of Struggle Against the Enemy on the Political Front in Various Revolutionary Periods," etc. Regarding the latter task, the main focus is on researching current practical issues from the needs of class struggle in our country, combined with production and construction and central tasks. In this regard, they have tentatively formulated the following research topics: "How to Establish, Develop, and Consolidate People's Mediation Organizations and Formulate Patriotic Pledges," "The Contract System After the People's Communes." Some of these topics are already under research, and some are being organized to begin research.

    吉林法学研究所
    确定研究方法和研究题目
    去年11月间开始筹备建立的中国科学院吉林分院法学研究所，最近已着手进行科学研究活动。在研究方法上为贯彻理论联系实际的方针，一方面进行系统的全面的理论研究和总结，一方面也拟对当前当地的具体问题进行研究。关于前一方面的任务，即用不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的观点，阐明中国革命各阶段阶级斗争的特点，联系当时的政治、经济、思想情况，从社会发展规律、阶级斗争规律方面，找出形成政策的物质基础，及其对社会发展的推动作用，从中总结出有指导意义的经验和教训，达到法学研究为政治服务的目的。为此，他们初步拟定了下列研究选题：“论中国革命各时期法律发展的规律和特点”、“关于中国法的理论的研究”、“关于中国革命各阶段的婚姻和家庭制度”、“各革命时期政治战线上对敌斗争方法、策略以及组织形式的发展”等。关于后一方面的任务，主要是从我国阶级斗争需要出发，结合生产建设和中心工作，对目前现实问题进行研究。在这方面，他们初步拟定的研究题目是：“如何建立、发展、巩固人民调处组织和制定爱国公约”、“人民公社化后的合同制度”等。这些题目，有的已在进行研究，有的正在组织力量着手研究。
