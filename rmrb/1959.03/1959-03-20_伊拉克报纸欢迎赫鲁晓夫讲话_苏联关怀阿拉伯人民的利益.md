Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 18th: "Al-Zaman" newspaper commented today on the speech made by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the banquet in Moscow to welcome the Iraqi government delegation, saying that Khrushchev reiterated the Soviet Union's sincere friendship with the Iraqi Republic and all Arab people. The newspaper welcomed Khrushchev's statement that policies that undermine Arab unity "only benefit the enemies of the people's freedom." The newspaper said, "Because the interests of the imperialist countries lie in weakening the Arab countries."

The newspaper also said, "It is natural for the Soviet Union to care about the interests and unity of the Arab people," because the Soviet Union has proven to be a true friend and true helper of the Arab people in their struggle against imperialism. The newspaper said that Khrushchev's warning to Nasser is a great contribution to world peace and especially to the Arab nation, because it is an active and genuine support for the liberated people in defending their security, independence, and sovereignty.

"Voice of Free Men" wrote today in commenting on the same issue: "The Iraqi people, who have received full support and assistance from the Soviet Union since the revolution, are proud of the words of this great friend of the liberated people. In the words of this friend, the Iraqi people found valuable support for their right to self-determination and in repelling the tyrannical forces that have gathered to overthrow our republic."

The newspaper pointed out that Nasser's response to Khrushchev's speech proved to be more absurd and confusing than ever before.

The newspaper believes that if the Iraqi people had not been vigilant, the Mosul conspiracy could have led to greater and more tragic disasters.

"People's Unity" pointed out that the experience of the long struggle of the Arab countries proves that "the friendship of the Soviet Union is a great guarantee of victory, and hostility towards the Soviet Union is an open betrayal of the interests of the Arab nation."

The newspaper said that Khrushchev's speech was a warning to anyone who dared to launch an attack on Iraq. The newspaper finally quoted a passage from Nasser's speech in the Soviet Union on April 29, 1958: "I pray for the Soviet people, who heroically fight against the imperialist aggressors, not only for their own freedom, but also for the freedom and independence of other countries. The nature of the Soviet system is one of friendship, fraternity, and peace. I pray for the unbreakable and eternal friendship between our two peoples."

The newspaper said, "Now, Nasser has entered the prayer place of Dulles and Eisenhower."

    伊拉克报纸欢迎赫鲁晓夫讲话
    苏联关怀阿拉伯人民的利益
    新华社巴格达18日电　“时代报”今天在评论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科招待伊拉克政府代表团的宴会上发表的演说时说，赫鲁晓夫重申了苏联对伊拉克共和国和全体阿拉伯人民的真诚的友谊。报纸对赫鲁晓夫所说损害阿拉伯团结的政策“只对人民自由的敌人有利”这句话表示欢迎。报纸说，“因为帝国主义国家的利益便是削弱阿拉伯国家。”
    这家报纸又说，“苏联关心阿拉伯人民的利益和团结是很自然的事情”，因为苏联已证明它是阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的真正朋友和真正的援助者。报纸说，赫鲁晓夫对纳赛尔的警告，对于整个世界和平、特别对于阿拉伯民族是一个巨大的贡献，因为这是对解放了的人民在保卫他们的安全、独立和主权方面的积极的和真正的支持。
    “自由人之声报”今天在评论同一个问题时写道：“自从革命以来一直得到苏联的充分支持和援助的伊拉克人民，对于解放了的人民的这位伟大朋友的谈话感到骄傲。伊拉克人民在这位朋友的谈话中发现了对他们的自决权利和在击退纠集起来要推翻我们共和国的暴政势力方面的宝贵支持。”
    这家报纸指出，事实证明纳赛尔对赫鲁晓夫讲话的答复，比过去任何时候都更为荒谬和混乱。
    报纸认为，若不是伊拉克人民提高了警惕，那末摩苏尔阴谋可能导致更大的、更为悲惨的灾难。
    “人民团结报”指出，阿拉伯国家长期斗争的经验证明，“苏联的友谊是胜利的伟大保证，敌视苏联就是公开背叛阿拉伯民族的利益”。
    这家报纸说，赫鲁晓夫的讲话是对每一个胆敢向伊拉克发动进攻的人的警告。报纸最后援引了纳赛尔1958年4月29日在苏联发表的演说中所说的一段话：“我为苏联人民祈祷，他们英勇地同帝国主义侵略者进行斗争，这不仅是为了他们自己的自由，而且也是为了其他国家的自由和独立。苏维埃制度的性质是友谊、博爱与和平的性质。我为我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的永恒友谊祈祷。”
    这家报纸说，“现在，纳赛尔却进入了杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的祈祷场所。
