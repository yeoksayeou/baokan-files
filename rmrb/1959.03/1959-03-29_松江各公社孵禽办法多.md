    (Our dispatch) Songjiang County, Shanghai, in accordance with the requirements of vigorously grasping, specially grasping, and rapidly grasping the production of non-staple foods, is seizing the current favorable opportunity for breeding poultry to launch a large-scale small chicken and duck incubation campaign, striving to hatch 800,000 chicks and ducklings by "Qingming" [Tomb Sweeping Day] throughout the county.

    In the large-scale incubation of chicks and ducklings, all communes in the county first grasped the implementation of the policy of simultaneously carrying out self-raising, self-breeding, collective incubation, and decentralized incubation. Tingxin, Fengwei, Xinqiao, Silian, Chengxi, Sheshan and other communes, as well as the urban area, all have incubation workshops. These incubation workshops all incubated the first batch of fertilized eggs in late February. The incubation workshops in Tingxin and Xinqiao communes have already hatched two batches of chicks and ducklings. The Tingxin commune's incubation workshop broke down superstitions and overcame technical barriers, starting incubation a month earlier than last year. While vigorously engaging in collective incubation, various localities have also vigorously mobilized commune members to incubate seedlings of domestic fowl. The broad masses of commune members (especially female commune members) are very happy about breeding small domestic fowl. After the Party Committee of Shanyang People's Commune called on every household to carry out the "Four Raisings (raising chickens and ducks, raising pigs, raising rabbits, raising sheep) All-Red" campaign, commune members used indigenous methods such as cotton and warming boxes to engage in large-scale incubation. According to incomplete statistics, the entire commune has already hatched more than 1,500 chicks and strives to hatch more than 67,000 throughout the commune by "Qingming," an average of ten per household.

    Here, in the development of poultry, the method of self-reliance in solving the problem of fertilized eggs was adopted. Some time ago, the fertilization rate of eggs in Songjiang County was very low. For example, the first batch of duck eggs in the Xinqiao incubation workshop, after a few days of testing, only 15% were fertilized. After research, it was mainly due to a lack of roosters and drakes for mating. In order to solve the difficulty of fertilized eggs, many cadres went deep down to find out the situation and found that the main problem was the uneven distribution of roosters and drakes, with some having many and some having few, and some even having none. Therefore, they launched a campaign of mutual adjustment, appropriate matching, and temporary placement. For example, the fourth brigade of the Tingxin People's Commune had more hens and fewer roosters, so they exchanged fifty roosters from the second brigade. Subsequently, with the commune as the unit, mutual adjustments were carried out between brigades and between production teams throughout the county, generally ensuring that there was one rooster or drake for every twenty to thirty hens or ducks. Units with a small number of hens and ducks, with the consent of both parties, temporarily placed the hens and ducks in teams with roosters and drakes. After these measures, the fertilization rate rapidly increased. The first batch of eggs put into the incubator in Xinqiao Commune's incubation workshop only had a fertilization rate of 15%, but by the second batch, it had risen to 30%, and the third batch had risen to 50%.

    In order to strengthen technical guidance and strive for 100% survival, the county's sideline production section invited more than twenty incubation workshop masters from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang to provide technical guidance in various incubation workshops. In addition to training a group of technicians from Shanghai, various communes also used forms such as on-site meetings and technical research groups to vigorously disseminate experience and impart technology. Now communes with incubation workshops can train their own breeders. In terms of collective breeding, each commune and brigade has established chicken and duck farms. After the incubator hatches chicks and ducklings, they are distributed to various breeding (chicken, duck) farms for rearing.

    Currently, Songjiang County is vigorously incubating chicks and ducklings. In addition to the incubation workshops having put batches of eggs into incubation, commune members' family incubation has also begun one after another.

    松江各公社孵禽办法多
    本报讯　上海市松江县根据大抓、特抓、快抓副食品生产的要求，抓住当前繁殖家禽的好时机，开展大孵小鸡小鸭运动，力争到“清明”全县孵出小鸡小鸭八十万只。
    全县各公社在大孵小鸡小鸭中，首先抓住了贯彻自养自繁集体孵化和分散孵化同时进行的方针。亭新、枫围、新桥、泗联、城西、佘山等公社以及城区都有孵坊，这些孵坊在2月下旬都孵了第一批种蛋。亭新、新桥两个公社的孵坊已孵出了两批小鸡小鸭。亭新公社孵坊由于孵坊工人破除了迷信，突破技术关，比去年提前一个月下缸孵化。在大搞集体孵化的同时，各地还大力发动社员孵化苗禽。广大社员（特别是女社员）对繁殖小家禽非常高兴。山阳人民公社党委号召家家户户开展“四养（养鸡鸭、养猪、养兔子、养羊）满堂红”后，社员们都用棉花、暖箱等土法大搞孵化，据不完全统计，全社已孵化小鸡一千五百多只，并力争全社到“清明”可孵化出六万七千多只，平均每户十只。
    这里在发展家禽中，采用了自力更生解决种蛋的办法。前些时，松江县的种蛋率很低，如新桥孵坊第一批鸭蛋，隔了几天一验，种蛋只占15％，经过研究，主要是由于缺乏公鸡公鸭配种。为了解决种蛋的困难，许多干部深入下去摸了情况，发现主要问题在于公鸡公鸭分布不匀，有多有少，有的甚至没有，于是发动相互调剂、适当搭配和寄放。如亭新人民公社第四大队雌鸡多雄鸡少，就到第二大队换回五十只公鸡。随后，又以社为单位，在全县范围内，开展了大队与大队、生产队与生产队的相互调剂，一般都做到每二十到三十只母鸡母鸭中有一只公鸡或公鸭。母鸡母鸭数量少的单位，就征得双方同意把母鸡母鸭寄放在有公鸡公鸭的队里。经过这些措施，种蛋率迅速上升，新桥公社孵坊的第一批入缸蛋，种蛋只占15％，到第二批已上升到30％，第三批已上升到50％。
    为了加强技术辅导，力争只只成活，县副业科到浙江萧山请来了二十多个孵坊师傅，分别到各个孵坊作技术指导。各个公社除了由上海市训练了一批技术人员外，还运用现场会议、技术研究组等形式、大力传播经验和传授技术。现在有孵坊的公社都能自己训练饲养员。集体饲养方面，各公社、大队都建立了鸡鸭养殖场，孵坊孵出小鸡小鸭后，即分到各个养殖（鸡、鸭）场去饲养。
    目前，松江全县正在大孵小鸡小鸭，除孵坊已分批下缸孵化外，社员家庭孵化也已陆续下窝。
