Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 23rd. Vice Chairman Zhu De, head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, warmly praised the revolutionary zeal of the Hungarian working class during his visit to the Beloiannisz factory in Budapest. He also expressed, on behalf of the Chinese people, his gratitude to the Hungarian people for their selfless assistance in China's construction.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and delegation members Xi Zhongxun and Hao Deqing visited the Beloiannisz Electric Factory on the afternoon of the 23rd. Accompanying them were Marosan, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and Aczél György, member of the Central Committee and Deputy Minister of Culture and Education.

As the Chinese Party and Government Delegation entered the factory, young female workers lined up on both sides of the factory and enthusiastically presented flowers to Vice Chairman Zhu and the delegation members. The factory director and the Party Committee Secretary first introduced the factory's situation in various aspects to Vice Chairman Zhu and the delegation members. Afterwards, Vice Chairman Zhu and the delegation members visited various workshops in the factory. They were warmly welcomed by the staff and workers during their visit.

In his speech at the welcome meeting held by all the factory's employees, Vice Chairman Zhu talked about the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Hungarian working class, as well as their revolutionary zeal in socialist construction. He said that today, in order to accelerate the socialist construction of their motherland, the Hungarian working class is responding to the Party's call and launching a vigorous socialist labor competition movement, striving to complete the main indicators of the Three-Year Plan in two years. All the employees of the Beloiannisz factory have also joined this competition with no exception. In less than two weeks, they have organized nearly one hundred production shock brigades, breaking various original targets, and have proposed such guarantees: to overfulfill the production tasks by 5% beyond the plan, to reduce production costs by 2.3% beyond the plan, to save 7 million forints of imported raw materials, and to strive to win the title of advanced factory within three months. From here, we can specifically see the revolutionary zeal and heroic nature of the Hungarian working class.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that like the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian people, the Chinese working class and all the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have also shown soaring enthusiasm and have achieved great achievements in the socialist construction of the motherland. We must accelerate construction and strive to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen, twenty, or more years.

Vice Chairman Zhu said: The Chinese people have received tremendous help from the Soviet Union, Hungary, and other socialist countries in their socialist construction. The Chinese people will never forget this brotherly selfless assistance. I would like to take this opportunity to convey the heartfelt gratitude of the Chinese people to the Hungarian people who have helped and supported our country's construction.

Comrade Marosan then spoke at the meeting. He said that the Hungarian people cherish the hardworking, simple, humble, and loyal Chinese people very much. He called on the staff and workers to actively produce and accelerate socialist construction.

Afterwards, the Party Committee Secretary of the Beloiannisz factory presented valuable gifts to Vice Chairman Zhu, Xi Zhongxun, and Hao Deqing on behalf of all the factory's employees.

After the visit, Vice Chairman Zhu wrote in the factory's guestbook: "Catch up with and surpass the technical level of capitalist countries. I wish you greater achievements."

    新华社布达佩斯23日电　中国党和政府代表团团长朱德副主席在布达佩斯的贝洛扬尼斯工厂参观时，热烈称颂了匈牙利工人阶级的革命干劲。他还代表中国人民感谢匈牙利人民对中国建设的无私援助。
    朱德副主席和中国党政代表团团员习仲勋、郝德青同志是在23日下午到贝洛扬尼斯电器工厂参观的。陪同参观的有匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央书记处书记马罗山和中央委员、文化教育部副部长阿策耳·捷尔吉。
    当中国党政代表团进入工厂时，排列在工厂两旁的青年女工热情地向朱副主席和代表团团员献鲜花。工厂厂长、党委书记首先向朱副主席和代表团团员介绍工厂各方面的情况。接着，朱副主席和代表团团员参观工厂各个车间。他们在参观时，受到职工们的热烈欢迎。
    朱副主席在工厂全体职工举行的欢迎会上讲话时，谈到了匈牙利工人阶级光荣的革命传统，也谈到了他们在社会主义建设中的革命干劲。他说，今天，匈牙利工人阶级为了加速祖国的社会主义建设，正在响应党的号召，展开一个轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，为两年完成三年计划的主要指标而奋斗。贝洛扬尼斯工厂的全体职工也毫无例外地投入了这个竞赛热潮，在不到两个星期的时间内就组织了将近一百个生产突击队，打破各项原订指标，并且提出这样的保证：超计划5％完成生产任务，超计划2.3％降低生产成本，节约进口原料七百万福林，争取在三个月内赢得先进工厂的称号。从这里，我们具体地看到匈牙利工人阶级的革命干劲和英雄本色。
    朱副主席说，同匈牙利工人阶级和匈牙利人民一样，中国工人阶级和全体中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，也同样表现出冲天的干劲，在祖国的社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就。我们要加快建设，争取在十五年、二十年或者更多一点的时间内，把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家。
    朱副主席说：中国人民在自己的社会主义建设中，从苏联、匈牙利和其他社会主义国家得到巨大的帮助。中国人民对这种兄弟般的无私援助是永远不忘的。我愿意利用这个机会向帮助和支援我国建设的匈牙利人民转达中国人民的衷心谢意。
    马罗山同志接着在会上讲了话。他说，匈牙利人民是非常热爱勤劳、朴素、谦逊和忠诚的中国人民的。他号召职工们积极生产，加速进行社会主义建设。
    接着，贝洛扬尼斯工厂党委书记代表全厂职工向朱副主席、习仲勋和郝德青同志赠送珍贵的礼品。
    朱副主席在参观以后，在工厂的留言簿上题了词：“赶上和超过资本主义国家的技术水平，祝你们取得更大的成就。”
