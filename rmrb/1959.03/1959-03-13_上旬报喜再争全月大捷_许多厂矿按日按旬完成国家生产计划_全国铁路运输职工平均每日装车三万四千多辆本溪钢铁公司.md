Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, March 12th - The ironmaking workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, in a vigorous high-yield, high-quality red flag competition, overfulfilled the March first ten days' pig iron production plan by 1,931 tons, and the quality of pig iron also improved compared with February.

Compared with the same period in February, the average daily pig iron production of Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased by 6.8% in the first ten days of March, an average increase of 327 tons per day. The utilization coefficient of the effective volume of large and medium-sized blast furnaces averaged 2.071, with the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant reaching 2.169 and the No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant reaching 1.974, continuing to maintain the glorious titles of national blast furnace production champion and runner-up respectively.

Currently, the workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company are advancing victoriously, determined to create new production records in the middle and last ten days of the month.

Benxi Coal Mining Area

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, March 12th - Benxi Coal Mining Area, one of China's important coking coal production bases, produced an average of more than 1,400 tons more coking coal per day in the first ten days of March than in February.

Based on overfulfilling the February production plan, the workers of Benxi and Caitun, the two major coal mines in this mining area that produce coking coal, continued to exert their efforts, and since the beginning of the month, they have launched a massive and vigorous red flag competition for large-scale bumper harvests. Workers promoted advanced mining methods such as comprehensive blasting, vibration blasting, and multi-stage cutting in the competition, which increased coal mining efficiency by 20% to 50%. The two coal mines also transferred more than 200 workers from administrative and auxiliary production departments to support underground coal mining, adding new coal mining working faces, which also played a significant role in ensuring the increase in coal production in the first ten days.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the red flag competition, leading cadres at all levels of the Benxi Mining Bureau and the two major coking coal mines went deep underground, contracted specific areas, participated in production, and supervised production, and arranged production and checked the implementation of plans on a daily and shift basis. Because the leadership was specific and problems were solved in a timely manner, the enthusiasm of the workers was greatly encouraged.

Anshan Iron and Steel Two Medium Plate Plants

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 12th - The two medium plate plants of Anshan Iron and Steel once again double-jumped the dragon gate in the inter-factory competition in the first ten days of March, overproducing a total of 1,142 tons of high-quality steel plates compared with the national plan. Among them, the No. 1 Medium Plate Plant completed 106% of the plan for the first ten days, and the No. 2 Medium Plate Plant completed 107% of the plan for the first ten days.

As soon as March began, the workers of these two medium plate plants launched a heated red flag competition for high yield and high quality. The workers of the No. 2 Medium Plate Plant exceeded the plan by 3.3% in the first high-yield week campaign from the 1st to the 7th; from the 8th, they launched the second high-yield week campaign. Their slogan is: "Red in January and February, strive for red throughout the whole quarter. The two plants compete to see who is the hero. The whole plant mobilizes to surpass the No. 1 Medium Plate Plant." The workers of the No. 1 Medium Plate Plant, based on the discussion of the national plan, also launched a red flag competition between shifts and groups; they proposed to strive to complete the production plan for the first quarter ten days ahead of schedule.

Dalian Steel Plant

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, March 12th - In the first ten days of March, the workers of Dalian Steel Plant, which holds the national red flag for high-yield electric furnace steelmaking in Dalian, launched a competition for high output, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safety assurance, and achieved a comprehensive harvest in the first ten days of March. By the 10th, the workers of this steel plant had completed more than 33% of the monthly steel production plan, and the steel production plan for the first quarter had been completed ahead of schedule.

After Dalian Shipyard used the "three combinations" method to determine new labor quotas, it launched an over-quota competition among all workers in the factory, so that the workers in each group knew their daily tasks and workload in advance, reducing many gaps in time. Almost all groups completed the plan for the first ten days by about 10% above the quota.

Dalian Seaport and the railway department, an important transfer station for the exchange of materials between the Northeast and Guannei, overfulfilled the loading and unloading plan.

Tianjin Steel Plant Section Steel Plant

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 12th - The workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant Section Steel Plant carried out a "quarter-hour competition" to seize steel from time. Since mid-February, the output of various types of steel in the entire plant has reached the production leap-forward indicators on a daily and ten-day basis, and the product qualification rate has reached more than 99.7%. The average daily output of the entire plant in the first ten days of March increased by 42% compared with the first ten days of February.

The "quarter-hour competition" was initiated by the billet opening section of this factory. Under the call of the Party committee, the workers in this section proposed to carry out the "quarter-hour competition" in order to ensure the supply of raw materials to the steel rolling workers in a timely manner, based on the characteristics that the steel rolling workers changed shifts every fifteen minutes. All 26 billet opening workers in the shift were divided into two groups to compete for advancement and catch up with the advanced. As a result, the shift's output reached a total of 206 tons, more than 30 tons more than the original plan of 170 tons.

The news of the "quarter-hour competition" spread throughout the factory, inspiring the workers of Shift B and Shift C. The workers of Shift B exceeded Shift A with a new score of 212 tons of shift output. The workers of Shift C exceeded the other two shifts with a new record of 223 tons of shift output.

In this way, the daily output of steel billets quickly rose to more than 600 tons, enabling the workers of the two sections that rolled various small steel products to also increase their output.

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 12th - Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant excellently completed and overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days in the great battle of March. The output of major products such as pig iron, steel, and steel products of Taiyuan Iron and Steel increased steadily in the first ten days, among which pig iron overfulfilled the ten-day plan by 17 tons, and steel output increased by 29% compared with the first ten days of February; under the slogan of "Learn from Taiyuan Iron and Steel, Catch up with Taiyuan Iron and Steel," the workers of Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant overfulfilled the ten-day iron production plan by 51 tons, an increase of nearly 30% compared with the same period in February, and the pig iron qualification rate increased by 3% compared with the same period last month.

At the beginning of March, the Party committee of Taiyuan Iron and Steel mobilized all workers to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, and tightly grasped the level of daily production, thereby ensuring the completion of the ten-day plan. At the beginning of March, the workers of Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant further carried out a high-yield, high-quality campaign. They tried every means to increase the air volume and overcome the difficulties caused by the poor quality of the ore, so that the pig iron output greatly exceeded the ten-day plan.

Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company

Hefei, this newspaper, March 12th - After all the workers of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a battle to seize high-yield and good iron from indigenous coke, the daily output of iron rose day by day. On March 10th, it finally broke through the 1,900-ton mark. The average daily output in 10 days increased by more than 20% compared with the average daily output in February, and the quality met the requirements of steelmaking and casting. Continuing to stabilize at this level, the entire company will be able to complete and overfulfill the March plan ahead of schedule.

Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has fourteen blast furnaces ranging from 71 to 255 cubic meters. Except for the six newly built blast furnaces, the remaining original blast furnaces used Anshan and Benxi's foreign coke to make iron in the past, but this year they have all been changed to using local coke from Anhui Province to make iron. Due to the low fixed heat, high ash content, and low pressure resistance of indigenous coke, the blast furnace production was not normal, which affected the output and quality of iron. The Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee and the leaders of the Iron and Steel Company actively took measures, mobilized the masses, and launched a competition to seize high-yield and good iron from indigenous coke, and finally solved the problem of foreign blast furnaces eating indigenous coke, so that the output and quality of pig iron from blast furnaces continued to improve.

Railway Transportation

Xinhua News Agency, March 12th - On the basis of successfully completing the February transportation task, the workers of the national railway transportation department have exerted even greater efforts to launch a battle to strive to fully complete the March transportation task. In the first eleven days of this month, the national average loading was 34,323 cars per day, 1,841 cars more than the daily loading in February, which is equivalent to transporting 70,000 tons more materials per day. The original plan for the freight car turnaround time was 2.49 days, and the average reached 2.48 days in the first eleven days of March. On the 11th, the loading was completed 35,491 cars, and the freight car turnaround time reached 2.40 days, creating the best transportation performance this year.

Currently, a vigorous red flag competition is gradually unfolding in railway units across the country. At present, railway workers are fiercely grasping the "three compressions (compression of freight car turnaround time, cargo handling time, and transit time), two improvements (improving travel speed and static load), and one elimination (eliminating accidents)" movement in railway transportation, demanding cars from time and efficiency from cooperation, and striving to create greater achievements in March.
