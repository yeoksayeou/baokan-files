Tito Clique Enraged Out of Shame
By People's Daily Commentator

After concluding his visits to Asian, African countries and Greece, Tito's first act was to deliver successive speeches, openly attacking and vilifying the leaders of socialist countries. In order to launch a so-called "counterattack" against socialist countries, Tito even resorted to fabricating rumors out of thin air. In his speech on March 7, Tito said with great seriousness, "When we visited Indonesia, there was a well-known Chinese, Zhou Enlai, who called on the Indonesian people not to trust us because we were serving imperialism."

This is truly a strange accusation. Everyone knows that during Tito's visit to Indonesia from December 23, 1958, to January 1, 1959, our Premier Zhou Enlai never made any remarks about Tito's visit to Indonesia. Tito's statement is clearly a complete fabrication based on his own imagination. His ability to lie publicly without blushing is truly astonishing!

However, the Tito clique is indeed serving imperialism, and Tito's trip to Asia and Africa should especially be viewed in this light. Socialist countries' public opinion, as well as the public opinion of Asian and African nationalist countries, has long exposed this. The Lebanese "Al Hadaf" wrote on March 3: "It is no secret to anyone that the role Tito is playing is one that is fully supported by the Western camp, especially by American imperialism. …Tito's main goal (which is also the goal of American imperialism) is to undermine the friendly ties between the Soviet Union and the people of the two (Asian and African) continents, especially the ties between the Soviet Union and the Arabs, and to cast doubt on Soviet foreign policy." The newspaper also pointed out, "What does the United States hope to see most, other than a country's president, under the guise of socialism, traveling back and forth on a speedboat, peddling old goods (which the Asian and African people have already rejected) that the United States has decorated with more charming and deceptive new packaging?"

Precisely in order to conceal this shameful activity and deceive the Yugoslav people, Tito deliberately pretended in his speeches after returning home, saying, "We have not talked to anyone about opposing anyone, and you can believe this." What a perfect example of "hiding the silver taels here." Tito, under the banner of "active coexistence," went around deceiving people everywhere, slandering the socialist camp, and using code words such as "all colonialism," "bloc politics," and "hegemony" to vilify socialist countries. Is this called "not talking to anyone about opposing anyone?"

After returning home, Tito, while saying that he "had not talked to anyone about opposing anyone," then turned around and lashed out at socialist countries, which is even more of a wonderful self-satire. Especially towards Albania, Tito even used threats, insisting that Bulgaria and Albania "covet Yugoslavia" and threatening to bring up Albania's "war-mongering" issue to the United Nations, etc. This is obviously deliberately creating a tense situation. No wonder the Associated Press, in a dispatch from Belgrade, described Tito's speech on March 7 as a "fiercely belligerent speech" with an appreciative tone!

In fact, it is not the socialist countries that covet other people's territory, but precisely the Tito clique and their masters and their partners. According to various sources, the Tito clique has long colluded with the Greek authorities,妄想to annex Albanian territory. It is no coincidence that the Greek authorities openly expressed their ambitions towards Albania precisely around the time of Tito's visit to Greece. Greek King Paul recently incited the Greek public, saying, "Forget about Cyprus. In order to acquire southern Albania, focus your attention on opposing Albania!" At the same time, the Tito clique came out to support the enslaving London Agreement, saying that this agreement brought "peace, improved life, and the possibility of independently deciding their own destiny" to the people of Cyprus. Isn't this singing in harmony and echoing each other? Although Tito repeatedly said that the Balkan military group was "dead," the facts prove that the activities of the Tito clique and Greece, one of the member states of the Balkan military group, colluding with each other, opposing socialist countries, and threatening Balkan peace, have not only not "died," but are intensifying. This best illustrates what medicine is sold in the gourd of Tito's so-called "active coexistence" and "non-bloc policy"!

Tito spent more than three months visiting eight countries, and the only "harvest" he gained was that in the eyes of more people, he more clearly exposed the true face of the Tito clique serving imperialism. It is absolutely necessary for the public opinion of socialist countries and the public opinion of Asian and African nationalist countries to expose the conspiracies and tricks of the Tito clique so that it does not harm the common interests of the people of socialist countries and Asian and African nationalist countries. However, it should be said that the most powerful exposure of the Tito clique is Tito himself. The fact is so, what's the use of Tito being embarrassed and angry!

    铁托集团老羞成怒
    本报评论员
    铁托在结束亚非国家和希腊的访问之后，第一件事就是连续发表演说，公然对社会主义国家的领导人大肆攻击和谩骂。铁托为了对社会主义国家进行所谓“回击”，甚至乞灵于凭空造谣。在3月7日的演说中，铁托煞有介事地说，“当我们访问印度尼西亚时，有一个闻名的中国人周恩来，他号召印度尼西亚人民不要相信我们，因为我们是为帝国主义服务。”
    这真是咄咄怪事。谁都知道，在1958年12月23日到1959年1月1日铁托访问印度尼西亚期间，我国周恩来总理根本不曾发表过任何有关铁托访问印度尼西亚的谈话。铁托所说的这番话，显然完全是按照自己的想像力捏造的。他这种当众说谎而不脸红的本领，实在令人吃惊！
    不过，铁托集团的的确确是为帝国主义服务的，对铁托的亚非之行，尤其应该作如是观。关于这一点，社会主义国家的舆论以及亚非民族主义国家的舆论，早就予以揭露了。3月3日的黎巴嫩“呼声报”写道：“对于任何人来说，这都不是一个秘密了，那就是，铁托所扮演的角色是一个受到西方阵营，特别是受到美帝国主义全力支持的角色。……铁托的主要目的（这也是美帝国主义的目的）是破坏苏联同（亚非）两个大陆上的人民之间的友好联系，特别是苏联和阿拉伯人之间的联系，并且使人怀疑苏联的外交政策。”这家报纸并且指出，“美国所最希望的，除了要看到一个国家的总统在社会主义的伪装下乘着快艇在海上来来往往，贩卖美国用更迷人、更具有欺骗性的新包装所装饰起来的旧货（亚非人民早已拒绝这种旧货）以外，难道还有别的吗？”
    正是为了掩饰这种可耻的勾当，并欺骗南斯拉夫人民，铁托在他归国后的演说中，故意假惺惺地说，“我们未曾与任何人谈到反对谁，这一点你们可以相信。”好一个“此地无银三百两”的声明！铁托打着“积极共处”的旗帜，到处招摇撞骗，诋毁社会主义阵营，用什么“一切殖民主义”、“集团政策”、“霸权”等等的黑话，污蔑社会主义国家，难道这叫做“未曾与任何人谈到反对谁吗？”
    铁托归国之后，一边讲“未曾与任何人谈到反对谁”，一边却对社会主义国家破口大骂，这更是绝妙的自我讽刺。特别是对于阿尔巴尼亚，铁托甚至使用了威胁的手段，硬说保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚“觊觎南斯拉夫”，并扬言要向联合国提出阿尔巴尼亚的“贩卖战争”问题云云。这显然是在故意制造紧张局势。无怪乎美联社发自贝尔格莱德的电讯带着赞赏的口吻，把铁托3月7日的演说叫做“气势凶凶的好战演说”！
    事实上，觊觎别人领土的，不是社会主义国家，恰恰是铁托集团和他们的主子以及他们的伙伴。据各方面消息透露，铁托集团好久以来就同希腊当局互相勾结，妄想吞并阿尔巴尼亚的领土。恰恰在铁托访问希腊的前后，希腊当局公开表露了它对阿尔巴尼亚的野心，这决非偶然之事。希腊国王保罗最近煽动希腊公众说，“把塞浦路斯忘了吧。为了取得南阿尔巴尼亚，把注意力集中到反对阿尔巴尼亚方面去吧！”在这同时，铁托集团也就出来为奴役性的伦敦协定捧场，说什么这个协定给塞浦路斯人民带来了“和平，改善生活和独自决定自己命运的可能性”。这难道不是一唱一和、互为呼应吗？铁托虽然口口声声说什么巴尔干军事集团已经“死亡”，但事实证明，铁托集团和巴尔干军事集团成员国之一的希腊，互相串通，反对社会主义国家，威胁巴尔干和平的活动，不但没有“死亡”，而且正在变本加厉起来。这最足以说明铁托所谓“积极共处”和“非集团政策”的葫芦里究竟卖的是什么药！
    铁托花了三个多月的时间，访问了八个国家，他所得到的唯一“收获”就是，在更多的人民面前，更清楚地暴露了铁托集团为帝国主义效劳的真面目。社会主义国家的舆论以及亚非民族主义国家的舆论把铁托集团的阴谋诡计予以揭穿，不让它危害社会主义国家和亚非民族主义国家人民的共同利益，这是完全必要的。但是，应该说，最有力地揭穿了铁托集团的，还是铁托自己。事实就是如此，铁托老羞成怒，又有什么用呢！
