Industry and Commerce Cooperate, Supporting Each Other
Commercial Departments Actively Support Daily Necessities Production

    This dispatch reports that in order to better meet the growing needs of the broad masses of people for daily necessities, commercial departments at all levels in Jilin Province are cooperating with industrial departments to actively support light industrial production, starting from supplying raw materials, organizing processing, and promoting products.
    In the spirit of industry-commerce collaboration and mutual support, commercial departments in various regions are focusing on large, medium, and small factories, and establishing connections with industries run by streets, schools, government offices, and enterprises; helping to solve problems related to raw materials, funds, equipment, and technology, and actively increasing production to expand sources of goods. After taking these measures, in just eleven cities and counties including Changchun, Jilin, Shuangliao, Yushu, Tonghua, and Yongji, more than 100 new and old factories of various sizes have been contacted, increasing new products that were not produced locally in the past, such as clocks, batteries, towels, socks, blankets, soap, fountain pens, and pencils, by more than 500 kinds.
    Commercial departments in various regions have immediately adopted specific measures for the factories they have contacted, making comprehensive arrangements based on the different characteristics and technical conditions of large, medium, and small factories. For example, the Changchun Municipal Commercial Department arranged for larger factories to produce technically complex products such as leather shoes, vests, and undershirts; medium and small factories to produce cloth shoes, socks, and gloves; and for small factories to first conduct trial production of small, scattered commodities such as tacks, bookbinding tacks, thumbtacks, and trouser hooks, which Changchun could not produce in the past, and then put them into production. The Daily Industrial Products Management Department of the Shuangliao County Commercial Bureau assisted the family members of government employees in establishing a soap factory with an annual output of 15,000 dozens through production-sales meetings. Commercial departments also gave strong support to large-scale light industrial factories. For example, after the Liaoyuan Paper Mill solved its financial difficulties and added power equipment with the help of the commercial department, its monthly output increased from the original 300 tons to 1,000 tons. The Hailong Paper Mill also greatly increased its output after the commercial department helped solve the raw material problem.

    工商协作　互相支援
    商业部门积极支持日用品生产
    本报讯　为了更好地满足广大人民日益增长的对日用品的需要，吉林省各级商业部门正配合工业部门，从供应原料、组织加工和推销产品入手，积极支援轻工业生产。
    各地商业部门本着工商协作、互相支援的精神，大中小厂一齐抓，并和街道、学校、机关以及企业办的工业建立联系；帮助解决原料、资金、设备、技术问题，积极增加生产扩大货源。采取这些措施以后，仅长春、吉林、双辽、榆树、通化、永吉等十一个市县，就联系上一百多个新老大小的工厂，增加了过去当地不生产的钟、电池、毛巾、袜子、线毯、香皂、钢笔、铅笔等新产品达五百余种。
    各地商业部门对联系的工厂，都立即采取了具体措施，根据大中小工厂不同特点和技术条件做了全面安排。如长春市商业部门把皮鞋、背心、汗衫等技术较复杂的产品，安排到较大的工厂生产；便鞋、袜子、手套等产品安排到中小工厂生产；对过去长春市不能生产的大头钉、书钉、图钉、裤勾等零星小商品，先在小工厂中进行试制，然后投入生产。双辽县商业局日用工业品经理部通过产销见面的方法，协助机关家属创办了一个年产达一万五千打的肥皂厂。商业部门也给大型的轻工业工厂大力支持。如辽源造纸厂在商业部门帮助下解决了资金困难、添置了动力设备后，月产量由原来的三百吨提高到一千吨。海龙造纸厂也在商业部门帮助解决了原料问题后，产量大增。
