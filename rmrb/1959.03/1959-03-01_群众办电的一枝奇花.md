A Rare Flower of Mass-Run Electricity
By our reporters Wang Dianxue and Xu Jiazhu

"Our hands are the power source!" This is the bold statement of the Dalian Shipyard workers in the mass electricity generation movement. The entire workforce of the Dalian Shipyard matched their words with deeds. They used their own hands to repair more than ninety pieces of previously discarded power equipment, construct more than thirty "small indigenous" power stations, and build a 6,000-kilowatt "small foreign" thermal power station, preparing sufficient power sources for a greater leap forward in production this year.

	Blooming from “Small Indigenous Groups”
On September 29th of last year, a dozen veteran workers from the ship delivery section of the Dalian Shipyard's Turbine Workshop gathered after a day's work to discuss matters. They were discussing how to increase power supply and improve production during the Great Leap Forward. At the time, section chief Zhang Yunhui said: I heard there is a type of indigenous steam turbine that can drive a generator to produce electricity. Let's make an indigenous steam turbine! This proposal was unanimously supported by everyone; however, no one could say what an indigenous steam turbine looked like. Veteran worker Liu Rongren said with confidence: The fans on the ship spin very fast when the wind blows. An indigenous steam turbine might be similar to a fan. I think we can't go wrong if we follow the principle of a fan. This opinion was strongly supported by everyone, and the discussion became a collective creative session. Everyone began designing the indigenous steam turbine. As the saying goes, "Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang," especially since these were veteran workers with rich experience. That night, they designed the indigenous steam turbine.

The next day at work, the news of the veteran workers making an indigenous steam turbine spread throughout the entire factory. The Party Committee Secretary, the Factory Director, and the Chief Engineer all came to the workshop to express their regards and encouragement, further boosting the veteran workers' enthusiasm. By two or three o'clock in the afternoon, they had assembled the indigenous steam turbine. When they connected the steam pipe for a test, it initially rotated at more than five thousand revolutions per minute, and later reached eight thousand revolutions per minute. However, whether it could drive a generator to produce electricity remained a question in people's minds. Upon hearing the news, the Mechanical Power Section specially sent two people to bring a generator to help them test. People from various workshops and departments surrounded the veteran workers, their eyes fixed on the light bulb used for the test. Liu Rongren opened the steam valve for five or six minutes, and the light bulb gradually changed from yellow to white, emitting a dazzling light. A burst of applause erupted instantly. Wang Xingshan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, tightly grasped the hand of a veteran worker and said: The indigenous steam turbine you made has opened up a new path for the factory to run its own power station!

The veteran workers who made the indigenous steam turbine did not expect that their creation would ignite a "small indigenous groups" electricity generation movement throughout the factory like a prairie fire. When the technical staff of the Copper Workshop's process team saw that the structure of the indigenous steam turbine was not complicated during the experiment, they immediately started making their own indigenous steam turbines. The 140 cadres of the Production Section, except for one female comrade who could not participate due to pregnancy, worked hard for ten days and made six indigenous steam turbines. From workshops to departments, everyone was involved in the "small indigenous groups" electricity generation movement. In just over a month, the entire factory made nearly a hundred indigenous steam turbines.

While the entire factory was making indigenous steam turbines, designer Huang Qiming, who came from a boiler worker background, was also thinking. He thought, if so many indigenous steam turbines are operating, but there are not enough boilers to supply sufficient steam, the indigenous steam turbines will not be able to rotate, how can they generate electricity? He said to Hu Shutang, a draftsman who worked with him: "Old Hu, we both come from a boiler worker background. If others can make indigenous steam turbines, why can't we make indigenous boilers to match their indigenous steam turbines for power generation?" The two men shared the same idea. They started immediately. Hu Shutang went to pick up discarded refractory bricks, and Huang Qiming went to find seamless steel pipe ends. In two or three days, the two men made an indigenous boiler. At this time, the "People's Commune," initiated by a group of veteran electricians to manufacture indigenous generators, was also established. They found rusty "foreign tiles" from the scrap iron pile, flattened the corrugations to replace silicon steel sheets, and made the factory's first 20-kilowatt indigenous generator.

Before the appearance of the first indigenous steam turbine, the entire factory only generated 200 kilowatts of electricity in two months. After the "small indigenous groups" electricity generation movement was launched, they generated more than 3,000 kilowatts of electricity in two months, generating more than 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity every day. The 900-kilowatt and 400-kilowatt generators made by the Mechanical Power Section and the Electrical Workshop, using black iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets, were matched with two 1,200-horsepower diesel engines and have been operating safely for more than 2,000 hours, generating electricity day and night.

	Bearing Fruit in “Small Foreign Groups”
Massive development of "small indigenous groups" for electricity generation enabled workers throughout the plant to break down superstitious thinking and accumulate experience in electricity generation. Therefore, while consolidating and improving the "small indigenous" power stations, it was possible to start manufacturing larger and more sophisticated complete sets of power generating equipment and build enterprise-owned power stations. The Chinese Communist Party's Dalian Shipyard Committee, after fully analyzing these favorable conditions, issued a battle call to the entire workforce to achieve "self-sufficiency" in electricity, and decided to use their own strength to manufacture four 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets to build a self-owned power station with a power generating capacity of 6,000 kilowatts. This pushed the mass electricity generation movement of the entire factory from the "small indigenous groups" to the development direction of "small foreign groups."

Manufacturing a 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generator set was most complex with the manufacturing of the steam turbine; in the manufacturing process of the steam turbine, the processing of the blades was the most difficult, especially the processing of the fifth and sixth stage moving blades. When professional steam turbine manufacturing factories process steam turbine blades, they use dozens of precision milling machines. The Dalian Shipyard did not have that many milling machines, so they had to use general lathes instead. This was the key of the key, the difficulty of difficulties. Two young socialist construction activists, young lathe operators Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande, bravely took on this task. At first, they didn't dare to start working for two consecutive days. On the third day, they tried it, and only made the blade tenons of four blades in twelve hours. Zhu Weiqin secretly calculated: if it takes three hours to process one blade, and there are more than 1,000 blades in four turbines, it would take two people eight months to finish. This was unacceptable!

After getting off work, Zhu Weiqin didn't want to eat dinner or sleep, and was always thinking blankly. His wife pointed at the child and said: Look, your father is thinking again. Zhu Weiqin told his wife that he wanted to study a tool. His wife quickly cleared the bowls and chopsticks and let Zhu Weiqin command, acting as Zhu Weiqin's assistant. Zhu Weiqin's old mother also helped to find things. The family worked hard all night and finally succeeded in researching the jig that Zhu Weiqin had imagined, and made a model. Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande used this special jig to increase the production efficiency of blade processing by about twenty times, processing forty-six blades in one shift. The task that originally required eight months to complete was completed in just over a month. In the process of manufacturing the steam turbine, the workers put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals and created more than a dozen special tools. As a result, from the end of October last year to mid-January this year, they successively made four steam turbines.

On the construction site of the "small foreign" power station, workers who had been trained by the "small indigenous groups" arranged the positions of boilers, steam turbines, and generators on a general layout drawing. Workers, cadres, and technicians from the Copper Workshop were responsible for installing various pipelines. Without construction drawings, they designed them themselves. If there was insufficient labor, they adjusted the labor organization, with two people doing the work of three people. Before the boiler was built and the steam turbine was installed, they installed the water pipes and steam pipes in advance. The workers installing the steam turbine had just tightened the foundation bolts, and they connected the steam pipes, enabling the first generator set to generate electricity the day after it was installed.

Recently, reporters visited this "small foreign" power station. In a factory building, a row of four 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets were installed. Guo Changrang, head of the Mechanical Power Section, pointed to a generator set that was running and said: This generator set can generate more than 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which is equivalent to one-third of the factory's electricity consumption. The pointer on the "output meter" was always stable on a red line, which indicated that this generator had reached the design level and was operating at full load. Director Guo said with a smile: The other three generator sets will also be able to generate electricity soon. At that time, the electricity generated by this self-owned power station every day will not only fully meet the needs of the factory's greater leap forward in production this year, but also have surplus power to transmit to the national power grid.

    群众办电的一枝奇花
    本报记者　王殿学　徐家柱
    “我们的双手就是电源！”这是大连造船厂职工在全民办电运动中的豪语。大连造船厂全体职工，说到哪里就做到哪里，他们用自己的双手，修复九十多台过去废弃的动力设备，建设三十多座“小土”电站、一座六千瓩“小洋”火力电站，为今年生产的更大跃进，准备足够的动力来源。
      从“小土群”上开花
    去年9月29日，大连造船厂轮机车间交船工段十几名老工人，干完一天活之后凑在一块商量起事来，他们商量的是：在大跃进中如何增加电源，提高生产。当时工段长张云辉说：听说有一种土汽轮机，可以带动发电机发电，我们就做一台土汽轮机吧！这个提议，受到大家的一致支持；可是谁也说不出土汽轮机是什么样子。老工人刘荣任满怀信心地说：船上的扇风机，被风一吹转得飞快，土汽轮机可能和扇风机差不多，我看就按照扇风机的原理干没错。这个意见大家十分拥护，座谈会就活跃起来，变成了集体创作会。大家开始设计起土汽轮机来。俗话说的好：“三个臭皮匠，凑成一个诸葛亮”，何况这些都是有丰富经验的老工人，当晚就把土汽轮机设计出来了。
    第二天一上班，老工人造土汽轮机的事，就传遍了全厂。党委书记、厂长和总工程师都到车间来慰问和鼓励他们，老工人们的干劲更大了。到下午两三点钟，他们就把土汽轮机装配起来，接上蒸汽管一试验，开始每分钟就转五千多转，后来每分钟竟转到八千转。但能不能带动发电机发电，在人们的心里还是一个问号。机械动力科闻讯，专门派两个人带来一台发电机，帮助他们试验。各车间、科室来参观的人，把老工人们围在当中，每个人的眼睛，都注视着试验用的电灯泡。刘荣任打开汽门五、六分钟，电灯泡渐渐地由黄变白，放出耀眼的光芒，霎时间掌声雷动。党委副书记王兴善紧紧握住一位老工人的手说：你们做的这台土汽轮机，给工厂办自备电站打开了一条出路！
    做土汽轮机的老工人们，也没想到他们做的土汽轮机竟像燎原的星星之火，在全厂燃起了“小土群”办电运动。铜工车间工艺组的技术人员在试验时看到土汽轮机构造并不复杂，他们回去就马上动手做起土汽轮机来。生产科一百四十名干部，除一名女同志因怀孕不能参加外，全科苦战十天，造出来六台土汽轮机。从车间到科室，都投入“小土群”办电运动，在一个多月的时间里，全厂做了近百台土汽轮机。
    在全厂大造土汽轮机的当儿，老锅炉工人出身的设计师黄启明也在想心事。他想，这么多土汽轮机开动起来，如果没有锅炉供应足够的蒸汽，土汽轮机不能转动，怎能发出电来？他就向一块工作的描图员胡树堂说：“老胡，咱们都是锅炉工人出身，人家能做土汽轮机，咱们就不能做土锅炉，配他们的土汽轮机发电？”两个人的想法不谋而同，说干就干，胡树堂去拣废耐火砖，黄启明去找无缝钢管头，两三天工夫，两个人就做出了一台土锅炉。这时，由一帮老电工发起，制造土发电机的“人民社”也成立了，他们从废铁堆里，找来长满锈的“洋瓦”，打平瓦垄代替矽钢片，做出全厂第一台二十瓩土发电机。
    在第一台土汽轮机出现之前，全厂在两个月里，只办电代电二百瓩；掀起“小土群”办电运动之后，两个月中发电代电三千多瓩，每天发电代电三万多度。机械动力科和电工车间，用黑铁皮代替矽钢片，做的九百瓩和四百瓩发电机，配在两台一千二百匹马力柴油机上，已经安全运转了两千多个小时，昼夜不停地发出电来。
      在“小洋群”上结果
    大搞“小土群”办电，使全厂职工破除了迷信思想，积累了办电经验，因此，在巩固、提高“小土”电站的同时，有可能着手制造比较大、比较精的成套发电设备，建设企业自备电站。中共大连造船厂党委，充分分析了这些有利条件，便向全厂职工发出用电“自给自足”的战斗号召，决定全用自己的力量制造四台一千五百瓩汽轮发电机组，建设一座发电容量为六千瓩的自备电站。这样就把全厂群众性办电运动，从“小土群”推向“小洋群”的发展方向。
    制造一千五百瓩汽轮发电机组，以制造汽轮机为最复杂；在汽轮机的制造过程中，又以加工叶片最难，特别是加工五级和六级动叶片。汽轮机专业制造工厂在加工汽轮机叶片时，要用几十台精密铣床，大连造船厂没有这么多铣床，不得不用一般车床来代替。这是关键中的关键，困难中的困难，青年社会主义建设积极分子、青年车工朱维勤和张连德两人，勇敢地把这个任务承担起来。开始，他们一连两天没敢开车干活，第三天试了一下，十二个小时只做好四片叶片的叶枨槽。朱维勤暗暗一盘算：三个小时加工一片，四台汽轮机有一千多片，两个人要八个月才能干完。这还了得！
    朱维勤下班回到家后，饭也不想吃，觉也睡不着，总是呆呆地想。他爱人指着孩子说：你看，你爸爸又在想心事了。朱维勤告诉爱人说，他想研究一种工具。他爱人赶快把碗、筷子收拾过去，听凭朱维勤调动，做朱维勤的助手。朱维勤的老母亲，也帮忙找东找西。一家人苦战一夜，到底把朱维勤想像中的胎具研究成功，并做好一个模型。朱维勤和张连德两人，用这种专用胎具，把加工叶片的生产效率提高了二十倍左右，一班就加工了四十六个。原来需要八个月完成的任务，一个多月就完成了。在制造汽轮机的过程中，工人们提出一百多项合理化建议，创造了十几种专用工具，结果从去年10月末开始，到今年1月中旬，就先后把四台汽轮机做出来了。
    在“小洋”电站建设工地上，经过“小土群”锻炼过的职工，在一张总平面布置图，安排好锅炉、汽轮机和发电机的位置。铜工车间的工人、干部和技术人员们，负责安装各种管路。没有施工图纸，他们就自行设计。劳动力不足，就调整劳动组织，两个人干三个人的活。锅炉还没有砌起来，汽轮机还没安装，他们就把水管、汽管都提前安装好了。安装汽轮机的工人，刚刚把地脚螺丝把紧，他们就把汽管接通了，使第一组发电机在安装完的第二天就发出电来。
    最近记者参观了这座“小洋”电站。在一座厂房里，一排安装着四组一千五百瓩汽轮发电机组。机械动力科长郭常让，指着一组正在运转的发电机说：这组发电机，每天能发三万多度电，相当于全厂用电量的三分之一。“出力表”上的指针，一直稳定在一条红线上，这表明这种发电机已经达到设计水平，正在满负荷运转。郭科长微笑着说：另外三组发电机也很快就可以发电，那时这座自备电站每天发的电，不仅完全可以满足今年本厂生产更大跃进的需要，而且有余力向国家电网输电。（附图片）
