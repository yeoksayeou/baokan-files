Japanese General Council of Trade Unions and four million workers belonging to neutral trade unions have launched large-scale spring struggle unified actions on February 25th and March 4th, and decided to hold three more such actions by around March 25th. This year's large-scale spring struggle fully demonstrates the growth and expansion of the Japanese working class. According to official Japanese statistics, as of June 1958, Japan had 19,580,000 employed workers, of which 6,880,000 were organized workers, with a total of 37,823 trade union organizations of various types.

The largest trade union in Japan is the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo"). The current chairman is Kaoru Ota, and the secretary-general is Akira Iwai. It has more than 40 industrial unions including steel and coal mines, with more than 3.5 million members, accounting for more than half of the total number of organized workers in the country.

　　"Sohyo" was established in July 1950, and soon after its establishment, it indicated that it represented the progressive desires and demands of Japanese workers. In March 1951, "Sohyo" held its second congress, and the US-Japan reactionaries frequently put pressure on the congress, attempting to force the congress to publicly support a separate peace treaty between the US and Japan. However, regardless of this pressure, the congress passed a resolution "opposing rearmament, adhering to neutrality, opposing the provision of military bases, and striving for a comprehensive peace treaty." Since 1952, the resolutions of the successive congresses of "Sohyo" have adhered to the line of safeguarding peace, strengthening international cooperation, and safeguarding the interests of the Japanese working masses, demanding cooperation with China and the Soviet Union, advocating strengthening cooperation with trade unions in Asia and Africa, refusing to participate in the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," carrying out the anti-nuclear weapons movement, and insisting on demanding higher wages, advocating the unification of the domestic labor front.

“Sohyo” also advocates using the “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence” as the basis for its political activities in international trade union contacts. It established friendly relations with the Chinese trade unions as early as 1953, and formally signed a friendship agreement with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of China in 1955. Moreover, this friendly relationship has continued to develop in recent years.

In 1958, the Japanese people heroically carried out the struggle against the Kishida Nobusuke government’s proposed "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" and the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and achieved considerable victory. In this victorious struggle, "Sohyo" stood at the forefront and made contributions.

Another national trade union federation in Japan is the All-Japan Trade Union Congress (abbreviated as "Zenro"), Chairman Minoru Takita, Secretary-General Haruo Wada. It has about 800,000 members, and its affiliated trade unions are mostly members of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." "Zenro" was established in April 1954. Its movement policy is different from that of "Sohyo," so these two largest trade unions in Japan have not been able to cooperate in the struggle for a long time. However, at the fourth and fifth congresses of "Zenro" held in 1957 and 1958, it expressed its willingness to cooperate with "Sohyo," but it also put forward so-called
"Four conditions for implementing unity," such as "liquidating the supremacy of class struggle, eliminating the influence of the 'World Federation of Trade Unions,' and severing relations with the Communist Party," "Sohyo" did not accept its "unity" conditions. However, despite this, "Zenro" and "Sohyo" had already carried out a joint struggle in the 1958 struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law". This shows that due to the continuous improvement of the consciousness of the Japanese working class, the trade union organizations in Japan have taken a step in the direction of unity in the struggle.

The third trade union federation is the National Federation of Industrial Organizations (abbreviated as "Shin Sanbetsu", chairman is Yoshihisa Okamoto. It has about 40,000 members. "Shin Sanbetsu" was established in December 1949. After the establishment of "Sohyo," "Shin Sanbetsu" once decided to join "Sohyo" in 1950. However, later, because the leading group of "Shin Sanbetsu" disagreed with the line of "Sohyo," it decided in 1952 to "cut off organizational ties with Sohyo" and not cooperate with "Sohyo." But similarly, in the struggle of the Japanese people against Kishida Nobusuke's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" last year, "Shin Sanbetsu" also participated in the joint struggle.

In addition to the above-mentioned three major trade union federations and their affiliated industrial unions, Japan also has some neutral trade unions that have not joined any national trade union federation, such as the All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union (more than 54,000 members), the Japan National Railway Locomotive Union (more than 50,000 members), etc. In recent years, these neutral trade unions have mostly taken the same struggle pace as "Sohyo" in major workers' struggles.

### 日本的工会组织

    日本的工会组织
    日本工会总评议会和中立工会所属的四百万工人，已经在2月25日和3月4日先后两次举行了声势浩大的春季斗争统一行动，并决定到3月25日左右为止，还将举行三次这样行动。今年规模巨大的春季斗争充分显示了日本工人队伍的成长和壮大。据日本官方统计，到1958年6月止，日本共有一千九百五十八万就业工人，其中有组织的工人已有六百八十八万人，各类工会组织计三万七千八百二十三个。
    日本最大工会是日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）。现任议长为太田熏，事务局长是岩井章。它拥有钢铁、煤矿等四十多个产业工会，会员有三百五十多万人，占全国有组织的工人总数的一半以上。
      “总评”成立于1950年7月，成立后不久就表明它代表了日本工人的进步的愿望和要求。1951年3月，“总评”举行了第二次代表大会，美日反动派对大会曾频加压力，企图强使大会公开支持美日单独媾和。但是大会不顾这些压力，通过了“反对重整军备，坚持中立，反对提供军事基地，争取全面媾和”的决议。从1952年起，“总评”历届代表大会的决议中，都坚持了保卫和平、加强国际合作和维护日本工人群众利益的路线，要求和中苏两国合作，主张加强同亚非各国工会的合作，拒绝参加“国际自由工联”，开展反对核武器运动，坚持要求提高工资，主张统一国内劳工战线。
  “总评”还主张以“和平共处五项原则”为其在国际工会联系方面进行政治活动的基础。它在1953年即同我国工会建立了友好联系，1955年正式和我国中华全国总工会签订了友好协议。而且这种友好关系近年来不断有所发展。
    1958年，日本人民英勇地进行了反对岸信介政府提出的“警察官职务执行法修正案”和修改日美“安全条约”的斗争并取得了不小的胜利，在这一胜利斗争中，“总评”站在前列并作出了贡献。
    日本另一个全国性工会联合会是全日本工会会议（简称“全劳”），议长泷田实，书记长和田春生。它拥有会员约八十万人，所属工会多是“国际自由工联”的会员团体。“全劳”成立于1954年4月，它的运动方针和“总评”不同，因此这两个日本最大的工会很长一个时期不能在斗争中合作。但在1957年和1958年举行的“全劳”第四次和第五次大会，曾表示愿和“总评”合作，然而它又提出了“清算阶级斗争至上主义，消除‘世界工联’的影响，同共产党断绝关系”等所谓
  “实行联合的四项条件”，“总评”没有接受它的这种“联合”条件。可是尽管如此，在1958年日本人民反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中，“全劳”和“总评”已经进行了联合斗争。这说明由于日本工人阶级的觉悟不断提高，使得日本的工会组织在斗争中，已经向团结的方向迈进了一步。
    第三个工会联合会就是全国产业别工会联合会（简称“新产别”，主席为冈本义久。它有会员约四万人。“新产别”成立于1949年12月。在“总评”成立后，“新产别”于1950年曾一度决定加入“总评”。但后来由于“新产别”的领导集团不同意“总评”的路线，于1952年它又决定“割断与总评的组织联系”，不与“总评”合作。但同样，在去年日本人民反对岸信介修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中，“新产别”也参加了联合斗争。
    日本除了上述的三个主要工会联合会和它们所属的产业工会之外，还有未参加任何全国性工会联合会的一些中立工会，例如全日本造船工会（五万四千多会员）、日本国营铁道机车工会（五万多会员）等等。近年来，这些中立工会在历次主要的工人斗争中多半都和“总评”采取了同一斗争步调。
