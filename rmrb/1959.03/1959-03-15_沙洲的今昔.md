    The Past and Present of Shazhou
    Chen Ai
    In March, the Yangtze River滩 (tān - shoal, sandbar) is already a green expanse. Wild grasses are lush, and reed seedlings are verdant. White daffodils and emerald-green *Cai Ling* flowers bloom all over the滩. The people of Shazhou say that spring has come especially early this year. Indeed, as soon as the spring birds sang their first notes, the hearts of the Shazhou people were already filled with the warmth and blossoming of spring.
    In times of happiness, people often recall the hard days of the past. In this season of gentle spring breezes and myriad colors, the people of Shazhou cannot help but think of the past and present of Shazhou.
    On the banks of the Yangtze River in Weicun Commune, Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, a legend is told: No one knows how many years ago, a large incense burner suddenly fell from the sky, landing mouth down and feet up in the great river, more than two miles from the south bank. Over many years, countless amounts of mud and sand accumulated on the legs of the incense burner. After who knows how many years, three large turtles crawled onto the three legs of the incense burner. Before long, they were buried under the turbid mud and sand, unable to move. Slowly, three small sandbars appeared: Turtle Mound, Lower Kai Sand, and Top Center洲 (zhōu - island, continent).
    Whenever Shazhou is mentioned, the people here can't help but recall the suffering and torment they endured in the dark years...
    It was not long after Shazhou emerged that a group of barefoot people in ragged clothes came from afar to this open sandbar to build embankments and settle down. They were determined to turn this place into their ideal home; however, just as the embankment was built, the big landlord Wang Shaoda arrived and seized the entire Shazhou for himself. Those farmers, worn out by the river winds and waves, cultivated the landlord's land, and after each harvest, they had to pay him one stone and two dou per mu in rent. With the grain plundered, people could only fill their stomachs with wild vegetables and roots...
    Every summer, the howling southeast wind pushed rolling waves against these three small sandbars, causing the narrow embankments to collapse in entire sections. Crops and thatched houses were submerged and washed away. Then, people had no choice but to squat on the remaining embankment tops. Faced with such a scene, people secretly thought: perhaps the heavenly soldiers were sent to retrieve the big incense burner? Or perhaps the big turtles were causing trouble, coming ashore to steal crops? So, people burned incense, worshipped Buddha, and prayed to the gods. People also thought of widening the embankments to block the wind, waves, and river water; however, at that time, people could not even afford to eat, so how could such hope be realized!
    The wicked do not spare others, and neither do plagues. The people of Shazhou suffered not only from the cruel exploitation of feudal landlords but also from the torment of schistosomiasis. Many were made sallow and emaciated, skin and bones, and many lost their parents, wives, and children.
    The people of Shazhou often wondered: When, oh when, will our poor Shazhou improve?
    Ten years ago, that day finally arrived. The people of Shazhou, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, liberated their hometown.
    The spring breeze blows across Shazhou,
    Ten thousand red flags flutter together,
    Grateful to our benefactor, the Communist Party,
    The people of Shazhou are endlessly happy.
    —This is the song of the people of Shazhou today.
    Ah, Shazhou has changed. Who would have thought that this remote sandbar would change so quickly, so well!
    The people of 顶心洲 (Dǐngxīn Zhōu - Top Center Island), a small sandbar in the middle of the river, have already moved to a beautiful village in Jiangnan and rebuilt their homes. 顶心洲 is planted with willow trees; in the past, walking from Turtle Mound to Lower Kai Sand required wading through more than two miles of reed-covered beach. Now? The two small sandbars have long been closely linked together. A wide embankment can accommodate large cars. In the center of Shazhou, a beautiful primary school has been built.
    1958 was a glorious year. It was also a happy and unforgettable year for the people of Shazhou. In the summer of that year, the people of Shazhou were thrilled. They joined the Weicun People's Commune. This was a great blessing. Now, a fish processing factory has been established on Shazhou... In the past, yields were only a little over one hundred *jin* per *mu*, now they have achieved a high-yield record of more than one thousand five hundred *jin* per *mu*.
    Last summer, a group of white-clad warriors came to Shazhou. In just fourteen days, out of the one thousand three hundred and forty-two people on the entire Shazhou, four hundred and fifty-seven schistosomiasis patients were one hundred percent cured. "We are reporting good news to Chairman Mao, telling him that the 'plague god' on Shazhou has been sent away," said Wang Guisheng, who had suffered from schistosomiasis before liberation, excitedly. This is what all the people of Shazhou are thinking.
    What can compare with the leap forward of our great era? What can compare with the joy of the people of Shazhou? In this season of spring blossoming, forecasting an even greater leap forward in 1959, the heroic people of Shazhou, under the leadership of the Party, are advancing in great strides with even greater soaring energy.

    沙洲的今昔
    陈艾
    3月的长江滩，已是一片绿色了。野草青青，芦苗葱葱。白色的水仙花，翠绿色的采铃花，开得满滩都是。沙洲上的人们说，今年的春天来得特别早。是的，当春鸟刚刚叫出第一声的时候，沙洲人民的心里，早已是春暖花开的世界了。
    人在幸福的时日里，常常会想起过去那艰苦岁月。在这春风和煦、万紫千红的季节里，沙洲人民不禁想起了沙洲的今昔。
    在江苏省武进县魏村公社的长江边上，流传着这样一段神话：不知在多少年以前，有一只大香炉突然从天上掉了下来，刚好口朝下、脚朝上地落在离南岸二里多远的大江里，在大香炉的脚上，积下了许许多多的泥沙；这样不知过了多少年、又有三只好大的乌龟，爬到了香炉的三只脚上，不多时，它们被混浊的泥沙压在底下，再也爬不走了。慢慢地、这里出现了三个小沙洲：乌龟墩子、下开沙、顶心洲。
    一提起沙洲，这里的人们都会情不自禁地回忆起在黑暗的岁月里所受的种种煎熬……。
    那还是在沙洲冒头不久，一伙赤着脚，穿着破烂衣裳的人们、从老远的地方、到这个空旷的沙洲上来，筑圩、成家。他们一心想把这里变成自己理想的家园；然而，当圩堤刚一筑起的时候，大地主王少达却赶来了，把整个沙洲夺到他的手里去了。那些被江水大风折磨得不像样子的农民种着地主的土地，每当庄稼登场以后，就得交他每亩一石二斗的租子。粮食被搜刮尽了，人们只能靠野菜草根充饥……
    每到夏天，呼呼的东南风推着滚滚的浪头、朝这三个小沙洲拍打，那狭小的堤岸，就整段、整圩地倒坍了。庄稼和草房子被淹没了，冲走了。于是，人们只好蹲到还没倒坍的堤顶上去。面对着这样的情景，人们心里就暗暗地想：是天上派天兵天将来打捞大香炉了吧？是那大乌龟作怪，上岸来偷吃了庄稼吧？于是，人们烧香拜佛，向神祈祷起来。人们也曾想把堤岸挑大一些，用来阻拦风浪和江水，然而，在那时，人们连饭都吃不上，这样的希望又怎么能实现呢！
    恶人不饶人，瘟神也不饶人。沙洲上的人们不但受着封建地主的残酷剥削，同时还受着血吸虫病的磨折。多少人被害得面黄肌瘦、皮包骨头，多少人失去了自己的父母、妻子和儿女。
    沙洲上的人们，常常这么想着：我们这个穷沙洲，到何日何时才能变好啊？
    十年前，这一天终于来到了。沙洲人民和全国人民一道，在共产党的领导下，解放了自己的家乡。
    春风吹来遍沙洲，
    万面红旗齐飘动，
    感谢恩人共产党，
    沙洲人民乐无穷。
    ——这是沙洲人民今天的歌。
    啊，沙洲变了。谁会想到这个荒僻的沙洲变得这样快，这样好呢！
    江当中的一个小沙洲——顶心洲上的人们，已经搬到江南的一个很美的村子上，重建了家园。顶心洲上栽满了柳树；从前，走乌龟墩子到下开沙去，要涉过二里多路的芦苇沙滩。现在呢？早已把两个小沙洲紧紧地联在一起了。宽阔的大堤，可以开过大汽车。沙洲的中心，已经建起了一座漂亮的小学。
    1958年，是光辉的一年。也是沙洲人民幸福的、永不忘记的一年。在这一年的夏天，沙洲上的人们沸腾起来。他们加入了魏村人民公社。这是天大的喜事。现在，沙洲上建立了鱼业加工厂……过去每亩只收到一百多斤的获得了亩产一千五百多斤的高产纪录。
    去年夏天，沙洲上来了一批白衣战士。只经过十四天的时间，在全沙洲的一千三百四十二个人中，就百分之百地治愈了血吸虫病患者四百五十七人。“我们向毛主席报喜，告诉他老人家，沙洲上的‘瘟神’已经送走了。”那个在解放前就患了血吸虫病的王贵生，兴冲冲地这样说。这是全沙洲人民的心里话。
    有什么能与我们的伟大时代的飞跃前进相比拟呢？有什么能与沙洲人民的欢乐心情相比拟呢？当此春暖花开，预报1959年更大跃进的时候，英勇的沙洲人民，在党的领导下，正以更大的冲天干劲，大踏步地前进。
