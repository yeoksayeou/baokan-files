Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 28th: The Central Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party today published a manifesto entitled "The Demands of the Japanese Communist Party in the Election" in "Akahata" (Red Flag), announcing the Japanese Communist Party's current policies on sixteen issues.

    Local elections in Japan will begin nationwide tomorrow. In June, Japan will also hold elections for the House of Councillors. Currently, all political parties are actively engaged in campaigning.

    The first part of the Japanese Communist Party's manifesto ("For Peace and Independence") calls for preventing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and, furthermore, abolishing the "Security Treaty," the Japan-U.S. "Administrative Agreement," the Japan-U.S. "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," and all other treaties and agreements aimed at subordinating Japan to the United States and engaging in war. The manifesto also states that all U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Japan, all U.S. military bases should be removed, Okinawa and Ogasawara should be returned, and the San Francisco Treaty should be fundamentally revised.

    In its manifesto, the Japanese Communist Party advocates: preventing the realization of the conspiracy to organize a Northeast Asia military alliance, breaking away from the military alliance established with U.S. imperialism, maintaining a peaceful and neutral stance of not participating in any military alliance, and establishing a collective security guarantee system for the entire Far East and Pacific region.

    The manifesto states that the authorities should no longer adopt any policies hostile to China, abandon the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and no longer obstruct the normalization of Japan-China relations. The manifesto also proposes abolishing the Japan-Chiang treaty, restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and concluding intergovernmental trade agreements and fishery agreements.

    The manifesto states that efforts should be made to achieve an immediate and unconditional ban on nuclear weapons, to promote a comprehensive ban by all countries on the manufacture, storage, and use of nuclear weapons, to abolish all treaties and agreements that allow the import of nuclear weapons and the nuclear armament of Japan, and to establish peace zones, especially nuclear-free zones, in the Far East and Pacific region.

    The second part of the manifesto ("For the Democratic Rights of the People") states that it is necessary to oppose malicious revisions to the Constitution and to abolish all treaties, laws, and government ordinances that violate the Constitution. The manifesto states: freedom of speech, assembly, and association, especially the freedom to conduct trade union activities and political activities, must be guaranteed.

    The manifesto also states that it is necessary to crush the plans to expand armaments and carry out nuclear armament, as well as conspiracies to militarize Japan through "Anti-Espionage Laws" and "Conscription Laws," and to disband the U.S.-commanded "Self-Defense Forces" which violate the Constitution.

    In addition, the manifesto announced the Japanese Communist Party's policies on the following issues: establishing democratic local autonomous bodies, establishing independent, autonomous, and peaceful coexisting foreign economic relations, establishing a comprehensive social insurance system, democratically reforming the tax system, peacefully developing and modernizing industry, democratically developing education and culture, safeguarding the lives and rights of workers, developing agriculture and fisheries and safeguarding the lives of farmers and fishermen, safeguarding the lives and rights of working citizens, developing small and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring the happiness and bright future of women and children, and achieving the unity of the people.
