\tBeautiful Hainan Island
\tYuan Shuipai

\tHaving just stepped off of the northern land still covered in remnants of snow, the moment I got off the plane I stepped onto this evergreen island covered in flowers, a feeling of joy that is naturally indescribable. Sea waves gently caress the beach, coconut trees pierce the sky, and the steps are adorned with potted roses, begonias, chrysanthemums, and red plums. The indoor temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, eating watermelon, drinking coconut water, soft breeze brings the intimate smell of the sea, evokes the memories of a person who has been away from the South and far away from the seaside for a long time.

\tIt is only March now, and Hainan Island has not yet entered the tropical summer, especially in Haikou City in the north. Although the hosts are wearing single shirts, the guests are still not used to not wearing sweaters for a while. We are obviously a little early. However, in the eyes of a foreigner, the flowers and fresh fruits here do not seem to be seasonal, but rather blooming and ripening continuously. Green coconuts hang high in the treetops, the ripe ones have already fallen to the ground, and the newly sprouted coconut seedlings are only a foot high. The ancient poems about Hainan are indeed factual: "The overseas scenery is unique, the willows and flowers bloom in all four seasons, no one cares about the coming of cold and the passing of heat, only look at the peach blossoms to mark the years."

\tSuch climate and geographical conditions are naturally important factors for abundant products. Yang Zejiang, Secretary of the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, enthusiastically introduced us to Hainan's products and construction. He talked about double-cropping rice, precious tropical crops such as rubber and spices, the famous Yinggehai Salt Field, shark fins, annatto wood, and crystal, from water conservancy construction to the long-term transportation plan, which made us fascinated. After we visited a small-scale exhibition room of local products, traveled to several places, and contacted some energetic local and foreign cadres who love Hainan, we are even more convinced that Hainan Island is a rich and beautiful treasure island. With natural resources, plus the hardworking and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, plus the Great Leap Forward, Hainan Island will be rapidly built into an even more beautiful pearl in the palm of the motherland than it is now.

\tVisiting the Search the Academy
\tI had enjoyed the Cantonese opera "Search the Academy" performed by Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannv in Beijing. The story of the play took place on Hainan Island. Xie Bao is very well written in "Search the Academy", and the play is also a good one. Therefore, when Liu Qingyun, Deputy Minister of the Hainan Propaganda Department, said that the site of the academy was still there, everyone wanted to see it. It takes more than ten minutes by car from the guest house. The site of the former Qiongtai Academy is now the location of the Qiongdong Normal School. According to the history teacher of the normal school, Xie Bao was a person from the Kangxi and Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty. He was born in Longqi Township, Qiongshan, passed the imperial examination, and resigned from his official position after serving for a few months and returned to his hometown to teach at the academy, with more than 100 students. It is said that there is also his tomb near Longqi Village.

\tThe school buildings of Qiongdong Normal School are of course larger than the academy in the past, but there is indeed an old two-story building in the backyard. A huge frangipani tree in the courtyard is blooming, the pillars of the building are made of stone, and there are carved beams. There are still several sets of thread-bound books hidden upstairs. Although the books are not Xie Bao's old belongings, the history teacher told us that, according to the old gentlemen, this building is the house of Xie Bao's academy. According to historical records, Xie Bao cultivated some outstanding students, and it is said that he was good at identifying talents and had the reputation of "unerring judgment of talents." But now the scale of our school is much larger than in the past. Qiongdong Normal School has six to seven hundred students, in addition to formal studies, there are also correspondence courses. When we went to visit, we saw wall posters about the discussion materials of "Song of Youth" posted on the wall. Normal school students and students from the affiliated elementary school were doing sports competitions, both men and women, which could not help but remind people of the fate of the maids in Xie Bao's era. Hainan Island was liberated in April 1950. At that time, there were only 53 middle schools with more than 8,000 students. By this year, the number of middle schools has increased to 349, with more than 72,000 students.

\tSu Dongpo's Place of Exile
\tVisiting this historical site aroused the interest in visiting another historical site. In ancient times when transportation was blocked, Qiongzhou was the place of exile for banished officials and prisoners, "Where is Yazhou, live through the Gates of Hell," and everyone regarded it as a dangerous place. Among the officials who were demoted in the past dynasties, Li Gang and Su Shi were the most famous. Now there are still scenic spots such as the Wang Gong Ancestral Hall and the Su Gong Ancestral Hall, which contain stone statues of Su Dongpo and several steles with his calligraphy. It is said that the "Floating Millet Spring" dug by the poet is still clear as ever. The courtyard is planted with flowers and plants such as red smartweed, standing cranes, and bleeding hearts, as well as various tropical trees, betel nut, sago palm, cinchona tree, etc., which is a quiet place for sightseeing.

\tOutsiders cannot easily distinguish between coconut trees, betel nut trees, and sago palm trees, all of which are trees with pinnate leaves. These leaves can be used to cover roofs and weave walls like thatch. Su Dongpo was demoted here. At first, he rented an official house to live in, but later he was not allowed to live in it. He had to "build a sago palm hut to live in," which must be the kind of thatched shed covered with pinnate leaves. But the poet was not overwhelmed by such encounters. Judging from his poems, he was optimistic and confident. He treated the ethnic minorities who were discriminated against and oppressed at that time equally, and he repeatedly praised Hainan Island. There are such lines in his poems: "Do not think of it as being thousands of miles away from the end of the world, there is a bathing breeze by the stream," "In vain, I have the meaning of an old scholar riding a raft, roughly knowing the sound of Xuanyuan playing music, I do not regret dying nine times in the southern wilderness, this trip is the most wonderful in my life," "Coming south thousands of miles is a really good plan." He drank with his Hainan Li friends, with sentences such as "Chinese and barbarian raise their glasses together, drunk laughing from the same cup." One of his four-character poems more clearly expresses his idea of national equality and sympathy for the weak: "Consult you Han and Li, are all one people, despise those who are not taught, how can it be true, resentment and robbery, searching for spears to cause each other, deception and mockery cannot be sued, the fault lies with our people…" Then below there are even more intense condemnations of the Han officials, "greedy and corrupt officials, eagles and wolves eat."

\tSu Shi used many poems to praise Hainan: "The ripe fruit has many hidden joys, the lychee breaks through the jade skin, the yellow mandarin overflows with fragrance," "Happy majestic wind comes from the sea." Four years of exile actually made him willing to stay and become a commoner, and even simply call himself a local: "Lend me three acres of land, build a thatched hut to be your neighbor (referring to his Hainan friend), if the cuckoo's tongue can be learned, transform into the Limu people," "I am originally a Daner (ancient Hainan place name) person, living in western Sichuan, suddenly crossing the sea, like a distant journey," the last four sentences are his poems to bid farewell to his local friends when he was pardoned and returned to the mainland.

\tThe Commune in the Coconut Grove
\tAlthough there were individual people in ancient times who sympathized with the Li and Miao people, no matter which feudal dynasty or reactionary rule implemented a policy of national oppression. Only after liberation did the ethnic minorities of Hainan Island obtain the right to national equality. In the past, they were forced to flee into the deep mountains, with insufficient clothing and food. Now the Li and Miao compatriots have come out of the deep mountains, many have moved to live on the plains, organized communes, and their material and cultural lives have greatly improved.

\tIn Yulin Port in the southern part of Hainan Island, in a village called Luhuitou, we visited a production team of a commune, which owns more than 500 mu of land, including 128 households, with a total of more than 600 people, most of whom are Li people. The houses covered with coconut leaves where they live are neatly arranged under the shade of coconut trees, with flowers planted in front of every house, and couplets encouraging production written on the doors, using Chinese characters. They originally had no writing and are willing to learn Chinese characters. Branch Secretary Li Yushan is a capable young man of 28 years old. He told us that all school-age children here have been enrolled in school, there are more than 20 middle school students, two college students in Guangzhou, and two studying in Beijing. As for himself, in the past, let alone studying, he didn't even have land to cultivate, not even a coconut tree, and only made a living by chopping firewood, with only one piece of clothing. After the land reform, he joined the party, studied in a people's school, and now he can read newspapers, take notes, and write reports. In 1958, he also went to the party school to study. Walking in the village, slogans and folk songs are everywhere on the doors, windows, walls, and trees, which shows the enthusiasm of the masses for learning culture.

\tThis coconut grove and the nearby rice fields originally belonged to the landlords. A Han landlord occupied more than 100 mu, and a Li landlord occupied more than 300 mu. If the farmers opened up wasteland themselves, they would also be snatched away by the landlords, and wild fruits became their only food. After the Great Leap Forward, they ate rice for all three meals. Hainan Island's grain output increased greatly last year, with the total output more than doubling compared to the early days of liberation. The average salary of the farmers in the Luhuitou team is seven yuan, and the highest is ten yuan. They have set up elementary schools and people's schools, and children have nurseries and kindergartens. We were taken by a Li women's federation director to visit the nurseries and kindergartens. Children live together well regardless of Han or Li. The children in the nursery are lying in hammocks swaying and sleeping. When the children in the kindergarten saw guests arriving, they ran out to hold our hands, very lively, singing "Socialism is Good" and other songs.

\tThe sunlight casts the sparse shadows of the coconut leaves on the river beach, various unknown tropical birds are chirping everywhere, a Li cadre who is praised for his loyalty to the party in the rural areas of Hainan Island accompanied us through the coconut grove, chatting about the past and present life, and the prospects of the commune. We looked up and saw the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall of the public canteen, and the slogans of the Great Leap Forward. All this made us feel that although it is far away in the southernmost border of the motherland, we are different ethnic groups, but we are brothers and comrades who are connected heart to heart, and we are walking the same path.

\tAs we talked and walked, we unknowingly left the village. At this time, we remembered the place name Luhuitou. What an interesting place name! What is the origin? Comrade Li Yushan seemed a little shy when answering our questions. In fact, this is a beautiful story:

\tOnce upon a time, a Li hunter was hunting a deer in the Wuzhi Mountains and chased it all the way to the Yulin Port seaside. The deer had nowhere to run, so it looked back, maybe looking for another way out. At this time, the hunter also looked in the direction of the deer's turn, and happened to find a Li girl... Later they got married, and their descendants settled in this place. A beautiful place should have such a beautiful name!

### 美哉海南岛

    美哉海南岛
    袁水拍
    刚踩过北方的残雪，一下飞机就踏上这花团锦簇的常春之岛，一种畅快的心情自然是难以形容的。海波轻拂沙滩，椰树高插云天，台阶上摆着玫瑰、秋海棠、菊花和红梅的盆栽。室内气温华氏七十度，吃西瓜，喝椰子水，软风吹来海的亲切的气味，唤起一个久别南方、远离海边的人的回忆。
    现在还只是3月，海南岛还没有进入热带的夏季，尤其是在北方的海口市，主人们虽则穿着单衫，客人们却还一时不习惯不穿毛线衣，我们显然还来得早了一点。不过在一个外乡人看来，这里的花卉鲜果似乎不分什么季节而是连绵地开着成熟着。青的椰子高悬树梢，成熟了的已经落到地上，而刚出芽的椰树秧只有一尺高。古人的咏海南诗确是纪实：“海外风光别一家，四时杨柳四时花，寒来暑往无人会，只看桃花纪岁华。”
    这样的气候和地理条件自然是物产丰富的重要因素。中共海南区委书记杨泽江同志兴致勃勃地给我们介绍海南的物产和建设情况。他从两熟的水稻说到名贵的热带作物橡胶和香料，从著名的莺歌海盐场说到鱼翅、胭脂木和水晶，从水利建设说到交通规划远景，使我们听出了神。当我们参观了一个小规模的当地物产的展览室，旅行了几个地方，接触了一些干劲十足、热爱海南的本地和外地的干部之后，我们更加相信海南岛真是个又富又美的宝岛，天然资源，加上勤劳的革命的各族人民，加上大跃进，海南岛必将迅速建设成为比现在更加美好的、祖国的一颗掌上明珠。
    去看搜书院
    在北京欣赏过马师曾、红线女演的粤剧“搜书院”。剧本故事发生的地点就在海南岛。“搜书院”中把谢宝写得很好，戏也是个好戏，因此，听到海南宣传部副部长刘青云同志说，那个书院的遗址还在，大家就都想去看看了。从招待所坐汽车十几分钟就到。当年的琼台书院遗址，现在是琼东师范学校所在地。据师范的历史教员告诉我们，谢宝是清康雍年间人，出生在琼山龙岐乡，中了进士，做了几个月官之后就辞官回乡掌教书院，有一百多个门生。据说龙岐村附近还有他的坟墓。
    琼东师范的校舍当然比过去的书院大了，但后院确有一座古老的二层楼。院子里一株巨大的鸡蛋花树正在开花，楼房的柱子是石头的，雕花的桁梁。楼上还藏有好几架线装书。书虽非谢宝旧物，但历史教员告诉我们，据老先生们讲，这座楼是谢宝书院的房子。据志书载，谢宝培养了一些高材生，并且说他善于识别人才，有“藻鉴不爽”之誉。但是现在我们的学校的规模远比过去为大了，琼东师范有六、七百学生，除正式学习的，还有函授的。我们去参观时，看到墙上贴着关于“青春之歌”讨论材料的壁报，师范学生和附属小学学生在作体育比赛，有男的有女的，不禁使人联想起谢宝时代的婢女的命运来。海南岛是1950年4月解放的，当时中学校只有五十三个，学生八千多人，到今年中学校已增加到三百四十九个，学生达七万二千多人。
    苏东坡的流放地
    访问了这个古迹，便引起了去看另一古迹的兴趣。琼州在交通闭塞的古代，是逐臣和囚犯的流放地，“崖州在何处，生渡鬼门关”，大家视为畏途。历代贬官之中，李纲、苏轼是最著名的。现在还有王公祠、苏公祠等名胜，祠内有苏东坡的石刻像和墨迹碑好几块。据说是诗人开凿的“浮粟泉”，至今清冽如旧。院子里种着红蓼、立鹤、麒麟吐珠等花草，还有各种热带树木，槟榔、桄榔、金鸡纳树等，是一个幽静的游览地点。
    外地人一时不易辨别椰树、槟榔和桄榔树，都是羽状叶子的树。这种叶子可以像茅草一样用来复屋编墙。苏东坡被贬到此，开头租了官屋居住，后来不让他住了，只得“结桄榔奄以居”，想来就是那种羽状叶铺复的草棚。但是诗人并没有被这样的遭遇所压倒，从他的诗中看，他是乐观的，自信的，他对于当时被歧视、被压迫的少数民族是平等相待的，他一再地赞美海南岛。有这样一些诗句：“莫作天涯万里意，溪边自有舞雩风”，“空余鲁叟乘槎意，粗识轩辕奏乐声，九死南荒我不恨，兹游奇绝冠平生”，“南来万里真良图”。他和海南黎族朋友一起喝酒，有“华夷两樽合，醉笑一杯同”等句。他的一首四言诗更明显地表达了他有民族平等、同情弱小的思想：“咨尔汉黎，均是一民，鄙夷不训，夫岂其真，怨忿劫质，寻戈相因，欺谩莫诉，曲自我人……”接着下面还有更激烈的痛责汉官的话，“贪夫污吏，鹰鸷狼食”。
    苏轼用不少诗句赞美海南：“果熟多幽欣，丹荔破玉肤，黄柑溢芳津”，“快意雄风海上来”。四年流放生活，竟使他愿意留居下来，化为黎民，甚至索性自称为当地人：“借我三亩地，结茅为子邻（指他的海南朋友），鴂舌傥可学，化为黎母民”，“我本儋耳（古代海南地名）人，寄生西蜀州，忽然跨海上，比如事远游”，后四句是他被赦回大陆时留别当地朋友的诗。
    椰林里的公社
    虽则古代也有个别的人对黎族苗族抱同情心的，但无论哪一个封建王朝或反动统治都是执行民族压迫政策的。只有解放以后，海南岛的少数民族才获得了民族平等的权利。过去他们被迫逃到深山里，衣不蔽体，食不果腹。现在黎苗同胞已经走出深山，不少迁到平地上居住，组织了公社，物质生活和文化生活都大大提高了。
    在海南岛南部的榆林港，一个叫做鹿回头的村庄里，我们访问了一个公社的生产中队，拥有五百多亩地，包括一百二十八户，共六百多人口，大部分是黎族。他们住的椰叶盖的屋子整齐地排列在椰树荫下，家家门口种着鲜花，门上写着鼓舞生产劲头的对联，用的是汉字。他们原无文字，愿意学汉字。支部书记黎玉山同志是个二十八岁的能干青年，他告诉我们这里的适龄儿童已全部入学，有中学生二十多个，有两个大学生在广州，两个在北京学习。他自己呢，过去不要说读书，连地也没有得种，一棵椰子树也没有，只靠砍柴过活，只有一件衣服。土改后他参加了党，读民校，现在能够看报，做笔记，写报告。1958年还进党校学习。在村子里走，一路上门窗墙壁和树上到处都是标语和民歌，看得出群众学文化的劲头。
    这片椰林和附近的稻田原来都是地主的，一个汉族地主占了一百多亩，一个黎族地主占了三百多亩。农民自己开了荒也要被地主抢去，野果变成了他们的仅有的粮食。大跃进以后他们三顿都吃米饭。海南岛去年粮食大增产，总产量比解放初期多了一倍多。鹿回头中队的农民平均工资七元，最高十元。他们办了小学，民校，小孩有了托儿所和幼儿园。我们被一位黎族的妇联主任带到托儿所和幼儿园去看。孩子们不分汉黎在一起生活得很好。托儿所的孩子躺在吊床里摇荡着睡觉。幼儿园的孩子看见客人到，奔跑出来拉我们的手，非常活泼，唱着“社会主义好”和别的歌子。
    阳光把椰叶的疏朗的影子撒在河滩上，热带的各种不知名的鸟四处鸣叫，一位在海南岛农村中以忠诚于党受人称颂的黎族干部，陪着我们穿走在椰林里，一边畅谈过去和现在的生活，以及公社的远景。我们抬头看见公共食堂墙上悬挂着的毛主席像，和大跃进的口号标语，这一切使我们感到虽则这儿远在祖国最南方的边陲，我们之间民族不同，却是心心相印的兄弟和同志，我们走着同一的道路。
    一路谈一路走，不觉出了村，这时想起了鹿回头这地名。多么有趣的地名！有什么来历吗？黎玉山同志好像有点靦觍似地回答我们的问题。其实这真是一个美丽的故事：
    从前一个黎族猎人在五指山上追猎一匹鹿，一直追到榆林港海边，鹿再也没处跑了，就回头一望，也许是找别的出路吧。这时，猎人也顺着鹿回头而望的方向去看，恰好发现有一个黎族姑娘……后来他们结了婚，他们的后代就在这地方定居了下来。漂亮的地方该有这样漂亮的名字啊！
