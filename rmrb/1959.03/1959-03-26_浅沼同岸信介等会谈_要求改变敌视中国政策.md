Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th: Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China held talks today with Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, and other leaders of the government and the Liberal Democratic Party. In the meeting, Inejiro Asanuma pointed out to Nobusuke Kishi and others that "the root cause of the stalemate in Japan-China relations since May of last year lies in the unfriendly attitude of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet." He said, "I hope that (the Nobusuke Kishi government) will change its past hostile policy and adopt a forward-looking policy to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations."

Asanuma then requested the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its "separation of politics and economics" approach, which it has always adopted in Japan-China relations; to respect the "Three Principles" aimed at breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations (stop implementing hostile policies towards China, do not participate in conspiracies to create "Two Chinas," and do not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan); and to adopt a policy of giving priority to political issues at present. Asanuma pointed out that the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations must follow international practice, that is, the two countries should issue a declaration ending the state of war and conclude a peace treaty.

During the talks, Asanuma and members of the delegation also gave detailed explanations of the contents of Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with Asanuma and the joint statement by Asanuma and Zhang Xiruo. In response to questions raised by the government, Asanuma and others stated that if the Kishi Nobusuke government respects the "Three Principles," the Chinese side does not refuse to hold negotiations with the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. However, on the issue of the "Three Principles," the Japanese government must express its determination to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations. Asanuma and others also said that the Chinese side believes that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is part of a policy hostile to China.

The leaders of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party and the government were unwilling to accept the legitimate demands of the Socialist Party delegation at the meeting. Nobusuke Kishi and others only stated that Japan-China relations are complex and delicate, and the government will treat the issue of Japan-China relations with a "cautious attitude," and wants to "decide on its attitude after studying the joint statement of Asanuma and Zhang Xiruo and other materials in detail."

    浅沼同岸信介等会谈
    要求改变敌视中国政策
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党访华代表团今天同日本首相岸信介、外务相藤山爱一郎等政府和自由民主党首脑举行会谈。浅沼稻次郎在会谈中，向岸信介等人指出，“从去年5月以来造成日中关系僵局的根本原因，在于岸信介内阁的不友好态度”。他说，“希望（岸信介政府）改变以往的敌视政策，为打开日中关系僵局而采取向前看的政策”。
    浅沼接着要求岸信介政府改变在日中关系上一向采取的“把政治与经济分开”的方针；尊重目的在于打开日中关系僵局的“三项原则”（停止执行敌视中国的政策，不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋，不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复）；并且在目前要采取政治问题居于优先地位的方针。浅沼指出，恢复日中邦交必须按照国际惯例，即由两国发表结束战争状态宣言，缔结和约。
    在会谈中，浅沼和代表团团员还就周恩来总理和浅沼的会谈、浅沼和张奚若的共同声明的内容作了详尽的说明。浅沼等人在答复政府方面提出的问题时表示，如果岸信介政府尊重“三项原则”，中国方面并不拒绝同岸信介内阁举行谈判。但是，在“三项原则”问题上，日本政府必须表示恢复日中邦交的决心。浅沼等人还说，中国方面认为修改日美“安全条约”是敌视中国政策的一部分。
    日本自由民主党和政府首脑在会上不肯表示接受社会党代表团的正当要求。岸信介等人仅仅表示，日中关系是复杂而微妙的，政府要以“慎重的态度”对待日中关系问题，想在“详细地研究了浅沼和张奚若的共同声明和其他资料以后决定态度”。
