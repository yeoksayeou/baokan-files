The U.S. military, under the guise of the United Nations flag, is lingering in South Korea, refusing to withdraw, and deliberately continuing to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, threatening peace and security in Asia. This is the conclusion people draw from the note of December 4, 1958, from the governments of countries on the United Nations Command side to the governments of China and North Korea. This note, delivered by the British government, avoids mentioning the demands made in previous notes and statements by the Chinese and North Korean governments for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. Instead, it repeats the old tune, saying that the precondition for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea is to hold free elections under United Nations supervision, and even includes an illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed by the United Nations General Assembly on November 14, 1958. It seems that the United States is still using the United Nations flag to insist on its military occupation of South Korea. And other countries that followed the United States in participating in the Korean War are also succumbing to the will of the United States, preparing to continue to bear the serious guilt of undermining peace in Asia for the United States.

A year has passed since the Chinese and North Korean governments put forward the peaceful initiative in February 1958 for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the implementation of free elections throughout Korea. Over the past year, the Chinese and North Korean governments have made sincere efforts to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers, in response to the suggestion of the Chinese and North Korean governments, completely withdrew from Korea in October 1958. This major peaceful action taken by the Chinese People's Volunteers has created new conditions for the early resolution of the Korean issue and has been warmly welcomed and universally praised by the people of the world. However, in complete contrast to this, the United States has not only repeatedly refused to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, but has also wantonly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and taken a series of provocative actions. According to Western news agencies, the United States last year transported "Honest John" rockets, 280mm atomic cannons, "Matador" missiles and other new types of weapons into South Korea, and began building missile bases near Chuncheon, south of Gangwon Province, South Korea, on July 4 last year. Since January last year, the U.S. military and the Syngman Rhee army have held a series of provocative atomic war exercises near the military demarcation line and along the east coast of South Korea, such as "joint atomic combat training," "joint night training," "atomic war commander training," and "joint amphibious landing exercises," including a "largest atomic war exercise since the armistice" involving 50,000 people. Aircraft from the United Nations Command side have illegally flown across the military demarcation line more than once, and have sent special agents across the military demarcation line to conduct hostile activities. The facts of the past year have irrefutably proven that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Korean people and the peaceful reunification of Korea. What the United States has done in Korea cannot but arouse great indignation among peace-loving people in Asia and around the world.

After the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew to their homeland, the United States has once again brought out the so-called precondition of holding free elections under United Nations supervision as a condition for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. As everyone knows, the United Nations, hijacked by the United States, shamefully became a party to the aggression in the Korean War, and has long since completely lost its qualifications and moral authority to deal with the Korean issue fairly. In Korea, the United Nations flag is the flag of the American robber. The United Nations General Assembly, year after year, under the manipulation of the United States, passes illegal resolutions such as so-called "free elections under United Nations supervision," simply to facilitate the United States to impose the dark rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime on the Korean people and annex northern Korea. This is also the purpose of the three-year Korean War waged by the United States. Now, the governments of various countries on the United Nations Command side have even attached such resolutions to the note sent to the Chinese and North Korean sides. This attempt to impose the resolutions of the United Nations, one of the belligerents in the Korean War, on the Korean issue on the Korean people is nothing more than a deliberate attempt to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and continue to cover up the long-term occupation of South Korea by the U.S. military. In order to maintain tension in the Far East and seek opportunities to expand aggression. This approach is not only absurd and shameless, but also further exposes the bellicose face of U.S. imperialism in refusing to ease tensions.

The Chinese government, in its own name and on behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has made a solemn reply to the note of December 4, 1958, from the British government representing the governments of various countries on the United Nations Command side, exposing the conspiracy of the governments of various countries on the United Nations Command side, especially the U.S. government, to continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and reiterating that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea, and the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves through consultations between North and South Korea without foreign interference. It must be pointed out that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is a matter concerning the reunification of the three thousand-mile land of Korea and the reunion of the thirty million Korean people; it is also closely related to peace and security in Asia and the world. The proposition put forward by the Chinese and North Korean governments that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves has become increasingly popular. Today, the call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea is rising. Even in South Korea, which is under the strict control of the United States, the movement against the U.S. military occupation is growing stronger, and even near the headquarters of the U.S. occupation forces in Seoul, leaflets have appeared calling for the U.S. military to get out of South Korea. This shows that it will not work for the U.S. aggressor troops to stay in South Korea for a long time. One day, the Korean people will force the U.S. aggressor troops to roll back.

The Chinese people fully support the statement made yesterday by the Chinese and North Korean governments, and resolutely demand that the U.S. aggressor troops and the invading troops of other countries on the United Nations Command side quickly withdraw from South Korea, so that the Korean people can realize their desire to reunify their motherland, so that the tense situation in the Far East can be eased. Otherwise, the United States and its followers will bear inescapable responsibility for the long-term division of Korea and the serious situation threatening peace in the Far East, and bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 美军赖在南朝鲜不走是不行的

    美军赖在南朝鲜不走是不行的
    美国军队在联合国旗帜的掩护下，赖在南朝鲜，拒绝撤走，蓄意继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，威胁亚洲的和平与安全。这是人们从联合国军方面各国政府1958年12月4日给朝中两国政府的照会中得出的结论。这一份由英国政府送来的照会，对于朝中两国政府历次照会和声明中提出的从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的要求，避而不谈；只是重弹老调，说什么美军撤出朝鲜的先决条件，是要在联合国监督下举行自由选举，并且竟然把联合国大会1958年11月14日通过的一个关于朝鲜问题的非法决议附来。看来美国仍在利用联合国的旗帜坚持它对南朝鲜的军事占领。而当时追随美国参加侵略朝鲜战争的其他国家，也屈从美国的意志，准备继续替美国承担破坏亚洲和平的严重罪责。
    自从1958年2月间朝中两国政府提出一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、实行全朝鲜的自由选举的和平倡议以来，已为时一年。一年来，朝中两国政府一再为促使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退作了真诚努力。中国人民志愿军响应朝中两国政府的建议，已在1958年10月全部撤出了朝鲜。中国人民志愿军采取的这个重大的和平行动，为朝鲜问题的早日解决创造了新的条件，因而受到全世界人民的热烈欢迎和普遍赞扬。然而，与此完全相反，美国不仅一再拒绝把美军撤离南朝鲜，并且放肆地破坏朝鲜停战协定，采取了一系列的挑衅行动。据西方通讯社报道，美国在去年已把“诚实的约翰”火箭、二百八十公厘口径的原子炮、“斗牛士”导弹和其他各种新型武器运进南朝鲜，并且于去年7月4日开始在南朝鲜江原道南部的春川附近建立导弹基地。美军和李承晚军队自从去年1月以来，在军事分界线附近和南朝鲜东海岸一带，举行了“联合原子作战训练”、“联合夜间训练”、“原子战争指挥官训练”、“联合两栖登陆演习”等一系列的挑衅性的原子战争演习，其中包括有五万人参加的“停战以后最大的一次原子战争演习”。联合国军方面的飞机不止一次地非法飞过军事分界线，并且派遣特务越过军事分界线，进行敌对活动。一年来的事实无可辩驳地证明，美帝国主义是朝鲜人民和朝鲜和平统一的死敌。美国在朝鲜的所作所为不能不引起爱好和平的亚洲和全世界人民的极大愤慨。
    在中国人民志愿军撤回祖国以后，美国却又竟然重新搬出在联合国监督下举行自由选举作为撤退美军的所谓先决条件。大家知道，为美国所劫持的联合国在侵朝战争中可耻地成了侵略的一方，早已使它完全丧失了公平处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。在朝鲜，联合国的旗帜就是美国强盗的旗帜。联合国大会，年复一年，在美国操纵下通过所谓“在联合国监督下进行自由选举”之类的非法决议，不过是为了便于美国把李承晚傀儡政权的黑暗统治，强加在朝鲜人民身上，吞并朝鲜的北部。这也就是美国进行了三年的侵朝战争的目的。现在，联合国军方面各国政府，竟把这样的决议，附在照会中送给朝中方面。这种企图以朝鲜战争中作战一方的联合国关于朝鲜问题的决议，强加在朝鲜人民身上的做法，无非是存心阻挠朝鲜和平统一，继续掩护美国军队长期占领南朝鲜。以便在远东保持紧张局势，俟机扩大侵略。这种做法不仅十分荒谬无耻，而且也进一步暴露了美帝国主义拒绝和缓紧张局势的好战面目。
    中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的委托，对1958年12月4日英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府的来照，提出了严正的答复，揭穿了联合国军方面各国政府，特别是美国政府这种继续阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的阴谋，重申一切外国军队必须从朝鲜撤出，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己在没有外力干涉的情况下，通过南北朝鲜的协商求得解决。必须指出，和平解决朝鲜问题，这是关系着朝鲜三千里江山的统一和朝鲜三千万人民的骨肉团聚的问题；这也是密切地关系着亚洲和世界的和平和安全的问题。朝中两国政府提出的朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己来解决的主张，已日益深入人心。今天，要求美军撤出南朝鲜的呼声日益高涨，即使在美国严密控制下的南朝鲜，反对美国军事占领的运动也正在发展壮大，甚至就在汉城美国占领军司令部附近，也出现了要美军从南朝鲜滚出去的传单。这说明美国侵略军要想长期赖在南朝鲜不走是不行的。朝鲜人民总有一天，会迫使美国侵略军队滚回去。
    中国人民完全支持中朝两国政府昨日的声明，坚决要求美国侵略军和联合国军方面其他各国的侵朝部队迅速撤离南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民实现统一祖国的愿望，以便远东的紧张局势得以缓和。否则美国及其追随者，将对朝鲜的长期分裂和这种威胁远东和平的严重局势负不可逃避的责任，并承担由此而引起的一切后果。
