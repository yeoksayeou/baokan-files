Hold High the Red Flag of High Production in Blast Furnaces
Steel Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry

    In the midst of the current intense battle to complete 18 million tons of steel, the nation's iron smelting workers are holding high the red flag of high production and high quality, advancing victoriously.
    Among the key enterprises, the blast furnaces of the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company are leading the way. The utilization coefficient of the furnaces in this plant has reached 2 or more for six consecutive months since September of last year. In February of this year, it jumped again, reaching 2.212. This means that each cubic meter of effective volume of the blast furnace produces 2.212 tons of pig iron per 24 hours. This is 0.873 higher than the utilization coefficient of Angang [Anshan Iron and Steel Group Corporation], and 0.805 higher than that of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.
    The situation is shown in the following table:
    
		Item  		Utilization Coefficient in February	Advanced Furnace in the Whole Plant
    Benxi First Steel Plant		2.212		2.22
    Benxi Second Steel Plant		1.904		1.964
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company		1.863		2.069
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company		1.407		1.429
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company		1.339		1.869
    
    If the utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces in all key enterprises could catch up with that of the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, then approximately 800,000 tons of pig iron could be additionally produced in the second quarter of this year, equivalent to the output of 60 blast furnaces with a volume of 100 cubic meters. Large blast furnaces can achieve a large-scale bumper harvest.
    The reason why the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has been able to continuously hold high the red flag of high production in iron smelting is not because its equipment is superior to other units; on the contrary, the blast furnaces in this plant are old. The reason it has achieved such results is because it has continued to exert great effort, strive for advancement, deeply mobilized the masses, and carried out technical revolution. The First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has the following three outstanding points worthy of promotion: First, break down superstition, liberate the mind, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and do everything possible to tap production potential. Last year, after they adopted the technical operation policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, the utilization coefficient greatly increased; but they were not satisfied. This year, they further took measures, changing the diameter and shape of the tuyeres and the charging system in February, raising the smelting intensity of the blast furnace to 1.477 (of which the No. 2 blast furnace was 1.499, with a maximum of 1.6).
    Second, rely on the masses to overcome difficulties. The production process of blast furnaces requires strict continuity. In all aspects, including raw material preparation, transportation, charging, blowing, furnace tending, and slag and iron treatment, employees must cooperate with each other, work closely together, and master the technology precisely and harmoniously in order to achieve consistently high production. At the same time, after the production of the blast furnace is increased, each link must be adjusted in a timely manner to form a new balance. Difficulties will be encountered at any time in the middle of this. The workers of the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company were not intimidated by the difficulties, but actively looked for ways to overcome them. For example, when the smelting intensity of the blast furnace increased and the speed of the blast furnace hoist could not keep up, the speed of the charging hoist was increased after repeated research by the masses, which adapted to the needs of production.
    Third, humbly learn from the advanced experience of brother factories. There was a time when the production of the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company was relatively backward. They humbly learned from the experience of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in increasing smelting intensity, the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in reducing coke ratio, and the experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company in mobilizing the masses, and creatively applied them to their own work, surpassing their teachers. It should be pointed out that although the red flag of high iron production is in the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, not all indicators of iron production are leading here. For example, the coke consumption per ton of pig iron in Benxi Second Steel Plant averaged 670 kilograms in February, which was 20 kilograms lower than that of the First Steel Plant.
    The red flag of high blast temperature is in Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. In February, the hot blast temperature of No. 1 blast furnace of this company was 1,038 degrees, which was 51 degrees higher than the blast temperature of the advanced blast furnace of Benxi First Steel Plant. For every 100-degree increase in hot blast temperature, pig iron production can be increased by 2-3%.
    The red flag of high blast furnace operating rate is also in Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. The shutdown time of No. 11 blast furnace of this company in January was 0.16%, while that of the advanced blast furnace of Benxi First Steel Plant was 1.92%.
    The red flag of qualified pig iron rate is in Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. In January of this year, the pig iron that did not meet the quality standards of No. 2 blast furnace of this company accounted for only 0.07% of the total amount of pig iron.
    The above situation shows that the First Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company still has great potential, and they can hold the red flag of high production even higher; at the same time, the above situation also shows that other units can also fully develop many positive factors, learn from Benxi, and catch up with Benxi.
    At present, the national competition movement for high-quality red flags in blast furnaces for steel workers has been enthusiastically launched. Through mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, vigorously carrying out mass movements, and vigorously engaging in technical revolution, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces will be further increased, and more and better pig iron will be produced for the country. (Attached pictures)
    Benxi First Steel Plant's utilization coefficient continues to lead the country.
    In order to ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed, the briquetting and sintering workshop held a skills competition, proposing to work hard and skillfully, resolutely break through technical barriers, and achieve a daily output of 1,400 tons of briquetted and sintered ore.
    This is the briquetted ore transported to the blast furnace.

    把高炉高产红旗高高举起
    冶金工业部钢铁司
    当前在为完成一千八百万吨钢而进行的紧张战斗中，全国炼铁职工正高举高产优质红旗乘胜前进。
    在各重点企业中，走在最前边的是本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的高炉，这个厂的高炉的利用系数从去年9月份起已经连续六个月达到二以上，今年2月份再度跃进，达到了二点二一二，这就是说，每一立方公尺高炉有效容积每昼夜生产二点二一二吨生铁。这比鞍钢高炉利用系数高零点八七三，比石景山钢铁公司高零点八零五。
    情况如下表：	项目  	2月份利用系数	全厂先进炉本溪第一钢铁厂		2.212	  2.22本溪第二钢铁厂		1.904	  1.964太原钢铁公司		1.863	  2.069石景山钢铁公司		1.407	  1.429鞍山钢铁公司		1.339	  1.869
    假如各重点企业的高炉的利用系数都能赶上本溪第一钢铁厂，那么今年第二季度就可以增产生铁约八十万吨，相当于六十座一百立方公尺高炉的产量。大洋高炉就可以取得大面积丰收。
    本溪第一钢铁厂所以能够连续高举炼铁的高产红旗，并不是由于它的设备比其它单位优越；恰恰相反，这个厂的高炉是老旧的。它所以取得这样的成绩，是由于继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，深入发动群众，开展技术革命的结果。本溪第一钢铁厂有以下三个突出之点值得提倡：第一，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞技术革命，千方百计挖掘生产潜力。去年他们采取了提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的技术操作方针之后，利用系数大大提高；但是他们并不满足，今年又进一步采取措施，在2月份改变风口直径和形状以及装料制度等，把高炉冶炼强度提高到一点四七七（其中二高炉一点四九九，最高达到一点六）。
    第二，依靠群众克服困难。高炉生产流程需要严密的连续性。无论在原料准备、运输、上料、鼓风、看炉以及渣、铁的处理等各个环节，职工都要互相配合，密切协作，掌握技术都要恰到好处，十分合拍，才能经常高产。同时，高炉生产提高以后，各个环节还要及时调整，才能形成新的平衡。这中间随时都会碰到困难。本溪第一钢铁厂的职工没有被困难吓倒，而是积极想办法克服困难。例如高炉冶炼强度提高，高炉卷扬机的速度赶不上，经过群众反复研究，增加了上料卷扬机的转速，便适应了生产的需要。
    第三，虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验。曾经有一段时间，本溪第一钢铁厂的生产还是比较落后的。他们虚心学习了太原钢铁公司提高冶炼强度的经验，鞍山钢铁公司降低焦比的经验和石景山钢铁公司发动群众的经验，并创造性地运用到自己的工作中，青出于蓝而胜于蓝，学先进又赶过了先进。应该指出，炼铁高产红旗虽然在本溪第一钢铁厂，但并不是炼铁生产所有指标的红旗都在这里。例如每吨生铁的焦炭消耗量，本溪第二钢铁厂在2月份平均为六百七十公斤，就比第一钢铁厂低二十公斤。
    全国高风温的红旗在石景山钢铁公司。2月份，这个公司的一号高炉热风温度为一千零三十八度，比本溪第一钢铁厂的先进高炉风温还高五十一度。热风温度每提高一百度，就能增产生铁2—3％。
    高炉作业率的红旗也是在石景山钢铁公司。这个公司第十一号高炉1月份休风时间为0.16％，而本溪第一钢铁厂的先进高炉则为1.92％。
    生铁合格率的红旗在重庆钢铁公司。今年1月份这个公司的二号高炉不合质量标准的生铁仅占生铁总量的0.07％。
    通过以上情况说明，本溪第一钢铁厂仍有很大潜力，他们可以把高产红旗举得更高；同时，以上情况也说明了其它单位也完全可以发扬许多积极因素，学本溪，赶本溪。
    目前，全国钢铁职工高炉优质红旗竞赛运动已经热烈展开。通过互相学习，取长补短，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，必将使高炉利用系数提高再提高，为国家生产出更多更好的生铁。（附图片）
    本溪第一钢铁厂高炉利用系致继续在全国领先。
    为了让高炉吃得饱，团烧车间召开了比武大会，提出要苦干加巧干，坚决突破技术关，使团、烧矿日产达到一千四百吨。
    这是运往高炉的团矿。
