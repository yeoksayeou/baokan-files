Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 27th – The Iraqi Supreme Military Tribunal concluded the trial of the first group of defendants in the Shawwaf treason case on the 26th. These defendants were Air Force Colonel Abdul Naji, Air Force Captain Kassem Azawi, Air Force Lieutenant Ahmed Ashur, and Air Force Lieutenant Fadhel Nasser, all of whom participated in the bombing of Baghdad Radio Station.

The court president, Mahdawi, announced that the two-day trial, which began on the 24th, proved that these four conspirators not only cooperated with the traitor Shawwaf to bomb the transmitting station of Baghdad Radio, but also plotted to assassinate Prime Minister Kassem and other leaders of the Republic.

Chief Prosecutor Colonel Mohammed Amin stated in court on the evening of the 24th when presenting the indictment against the defendants that the traitor Shawwaf's conspiracy—of which these four criminal pilots executed a part—was not the beginning of President Nasser's conspiracies. This was the third in a series of conspiracies launched by Nasser. The Iraqi people and their leaders learned of the first of this series of conspiracies in the first week after the Iraqi Revolution. On July 18th, Egyptian Military Attaché to Iraq, Colonel Farid Abdul Majid, sent a telegram to President Nasser. In the telegram, he informed Nasser that Arif was preparing to incorporate Iraq into the United Arab Republic and to kill Prime Minister Kassem. Subsequently, Arif visited Damascus and held talks with false vanguards of nationalism. At that time, they agreed to kill our leader, Kassem, and agreed to assassinate him when Prime Minister Kassem arrived at the Damascus airport at Nasser's invitation. Prime Minister Kassem knew about this conspiracy and therefore refused the invitation.

The Chief Prosecutor said that the People's Court had already sentenced the criminals, headed by Rashid Gailani, who participated in the second conspiracy that had been crushed, to death.

He said that although all the conspiracies planned by the Nasser group had failed, "Nasser ignited the flames of rebellion for the third time. This time, the role of 'nationalist leader' was played by the foolish Shawwaf." The Chief Prosecutor mentioned that certain tribal leaders and feudal elements had informed members of the Syrian Region’s Second Bureau (intelligence agency), who had come to Mosul to plot conspiracies, that they were prepared to cooperate with the army in Mosul to carry out an armed coup to overthrow the current government. They also expressed their extreme dissatisfaction with the Iraqi government's confiscation of their land and distribution of the land to the peasants. They expressed their support for Arif's rule, because he pursued the kind of policy that Nasser pursued, which sympathized with the feudal elements. The Chief Prosecutor pointed out that the officers of the Second Bureau assured them that weapons could be obtained in Telkujak, and said that the Nasser government intended to kill Kassem at any cost. The Chief Prosecutor said, "All these details have been recorded on audiotapes, and these audiotapes are kept by the officials." After this, the United Arab Republic Military Attaché visited Mosul several times, and during these visits, he held talks with Shawwaf and his staff officer, Mohammed Aziz.

The Chief Prosecutor continued, Aziz then went to Syria, and after he returned, he informed Shawwaf that President Nasser had said: "The United Arab Republic will provide as much assistance as possible to this movement." The Chief Prosecutor said that Shawwaf himself went to Kirkuk to contact Brigadier General Tabakatahili, the former commander of the Second Division. The two of them initially decided to begin the operation in Baghdad on the evening of March 4th, sending several teams of armed forces to occupy Baghdad Radio Station and control the Ministry of Defense. Another group of spies was to arrest Prime Minister Kassem. If this plan failed, the Air Force at Rashid Airport and Habbaniyah base would bomb the Ministry of Defense to ignite the spark of "revolution." Later, they changed this plan and announced that Shawwaf would lead a rebellion in Mosul, and use a radio station transported from Syria to issue declarations, which is what actually happened on March 8th.

The Chief Prosecutor pointed out that it is clear from the results of the investigation and the confessed and implicit confessions made by the defendants that the rebellion movement, in which some aircraft from the Seventh Squadron of the Air Force in Mosul participated, was to bomb the transmitting station of Baghdad Radio, to silence the voice of the Iraqi Republic represented by the radio station, in order to create an atmosphere for the free broadcasting of Mosul Radio, and the radio stations of the United Arab Republic were to pave the way for this, and the radio stations of the United Arab Republic indeed did so, and fulfilled their obligations. The plan also intended to bomb the Ministry of Defense where the Iraqi leaders lived, and in fact, these defendants had played this dirty role. On the morning of March 9th, two "Fury" aircraft, led by Lieutenant Fadhel Nasser, bombed Baghdad Radio Station, resulting in the sacrifice of a policeman, several people injured, and damage to the radio station building.

The Chief Prosecutor said that at this time, government aircraft flew to Mosul and destroyed the rebel center with rockets, and the traitor Shawwaf was injured and fled from his center, and was later killed by the heroic Iraqi soldiers. Captain Kassem Azawi saw that Shawwaf was dead, and wanted to fly an aircraft to bomb the Ministry of Defense. However, the heroic soldiers surrounded his aircraft, forcing him to get out of the aircraft, and immediately arrested him. After completing his despicable task, Lieutenant Fadhel Nasser flew back to Mosul Airport, but he was caught by the masses and handed over to the authorities. Air Force Colonel Abdul Naji ordered the soldiers and officers to fly the aircraft with rockets and leave the base, and ordered the bombing of Baghdad. He refused to obey the orders of the Air Force Commander, saying, "I accept the orders of the Nasser government, not the Baghdad government."

The Chief Prosecutor finally requested that all the defendants be sentenced to death.

During the court's trial of the defendants, all the witnesses testified to the crimes of the defendants.

When the court president, Mahdawi, concluded the trial of the four defendants on the 26th, he announced that the court would reconvene on the evening of the 28th to announce the verdict against the defendants.

    伊拉克军事法庭继续审讯沙瓦夫叛国案
    起诉书揭露了阿联策动叛乱的始末
    新华社巴格达27日电　伊拉克最高军事法庭26日结束了对参加沙瓦夫叛国案的第一批被告的审讯。这些被告是参加轰炸巴格达电台的飞机驾驶员空军上校阿卜杜勒·纳吉、空军上尉卡塞姆·阿扎维、空军中尉艾哈迈德·阿舒尔和空军中尉法德赫勒·纳赛尔。
    法庭庭长马赫达维宣布，从24日开始的两天审讯证明这四个阴谋者不但同卖国贼沙瓦夫合作要轰炸巴格达电台的发射台，并且图谋暗杀卡塞姆总理和共和国的其它领袖。
    总检察官穆罕默德·阿明上校24日晚间在法庭上对被告提出起诉时说，卖国贼沙瓦夫的阴谋——这四个犯罪的飞行员执行了这个阴谋的一部分——并不是纳赛尔总统的阴谋的开端。这是纳赛尔所发动的一系列阴谋中的第三次。伊拉克人民和他们的领袖在伊拉克革命后的第一个星期就掌握了这一系列阴谋的第一个。在7月18日，埃及驻伊拉克陆军武官法里德·阿卜杜勒·马吉德上校打了一个电报给纳赛尔总统。他在电报中通知纳赛尔，阿里夫准备把伊拉克并入阿联和杀掉卡塞姆总理。随后，阿里夫访问大马士革，并且同民族主义的假先锋举行了会谈。当时，他们同意杀掉我们的领袖卡塞姆。并且同意在卡塞姆总理应纳赛尔邀请到达大马士革机场时暗杀他。卡塞姆总理知道这个阴谋因而拒绝了这一邀请。
    总检察官说，人民法庭已经判处参与已被粉碎的第二次阴谋的以拉希德·盖拉尼为首的罪犯们以死刑。
    他说，尽管纳赛尔集团策划的所有阴谋都失败了，“纳赛尔却第三次燃起叛乱之火。这次‘民族主义领袖’的角色是由愚蠢的沙瓦夫扮演的”。总检察官提到某些部族首脑和封建分子曾通知前来摩苏尔策划阴谋活动的叙利亚地区第二局（情报局）的成员说，他们准备同摩苏尔的陆军合作进行推翻现政府的武装政变。他们还向他表示对伊拉克政府没收他们的土地和把土地分配给农民极为不满。他们表示拥护阿里夫执政，因为他奉行着纳赛尔所奉行的那种同情封建分子的政策。总检察官指出，第二局的军官向他们保证说，在特勒库贾克可以得到军火，并且说，纳赛尔政府打算不惜任何代价杀死卡塞姆。总检察官说，“所有这些细节都已录入录音带内，这些录音带由官员们保管。”在这以后，阿联武官曾多次去摩苏尔访问，在访问时，他同沙瓦夫和他的参谋军官穆罕默德·阿齐兹进行了会谈。
    总检察官继续说，于是阿齐兹就到叙利亚去，在他回来后，他通知沙瓦夫，纳赛尔总统说：“阿联将尽可能援助这个运动”。总检察官说，沙瓦夫就亲身到基尔库克去同第二师前师长塔巴克塔希利准将联系，他们两个人起初决定3月4日晚上在巴格达开始行动，派几队武装部队占领巴格达电台和控制国防部。另外有一批间谍去逮捕卡塞姆总理。如果这个计划失败的话，拉希德机场和哈巴尼雅基地的空军将轰炸国防部，以燃起“革命”的火花。后来，他们改变了这个计划，宣布由沙瓦夫领导在摩苏尔发动叛乱，并且利用从叙利亚运入的电台发表宣言，这就是在3月8日实际所发生的事情。
    总检察官指出，从调查结果和被告所作的坦白的和含蓄的供词可以明显看出，有摩苏尔的空军第七队的某些飞机参加的叛乱运动要轰炸巴格达电台的发射台，使广播电台所代表的伊拉克共和国的呼声停止，以创造摩苏尔电台自由广播的气氛，而阿联电台要为此铺平道路，阿联电台的确这样做了，并且尽了它们的义务。计划还打算轰炸伊拉克领导人所住的国防部，实际上这些被告已经扮演了这种肮脏的角色。3月9日上午由被告法德赫勒·纳赛尔中尉率领的两架“祖里式”飞机轰炸了巴格达广播电台，结果有一名警察牺牲，有几个人受伤，并且毁坏了广播电台大楼。
    总检察官说，就在这个时候，政府的飞机飞向摩苏尔，用火箭摧毁叛乱中心，卖国贼沙瓦夫受了伤从他的中心逃跑，后来被伊拉克英勇的士兵打死了。卡塞姆·阿扎维上尉看见沙瓦夫死了，就想驾驶飞机去轰炸国防部。但是，英勇的士兵把他的飞机包围了，迫使他走出飞机，并立刻把他逮捕。被告法德赫勒·纳赛尔中尉在完成他那卑鄙的任务之后，飞回摩苏尔机场，但是他被群众抓住交给了当局。被告阿卜杜勒·纳吉空军上校命令士兵和军官们驾驶飞机带上火箭离开基地，并且下令轰炸巴格达，他拒绝服从空军司令的命令，他说，“我接受纳赛尔政府的命令，而不是巴格达政府的命令。”
    总检察官最后要求把所有被告处以死刑。
    在法庭审讯被告的过程中，全体证人都证明了被告的罪行。
    法庭庭长马赫达维在26日结束对四名被告的审讯时宣布法庭将在28日晚上再次开庭宣布对被告的判决。
