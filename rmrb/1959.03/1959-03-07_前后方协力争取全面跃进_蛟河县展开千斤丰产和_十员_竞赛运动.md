    Front and Rear Unite to Strive for an All-Round Leap Forward
    Jiaohe County Launches Thousand-Jin Harvest and "Ten Members" Competition Campaign
    (Our Jiaohe Dispatch, March 6) Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, which had the highest per-unit yield of grain in 1958, is determined to double its production this year on the basis of last year's increased production. The county has formulated a plan for an all-round great revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and has put forward a proposal to all cities and counties in the province to carry out a mu-yield-thousand-jin competition.

    Last year, the people of Jiaohe County unleashed soaring enthusiasm, achieving a grain yield of 453 jin per mu, more than double that of 1957. Thanks to the all-round development of production by the communes, the abundant resources were initially utilized, and the output of forestry, sideline occupations, fisheries, and industry all increased by about 150% compared to 1957. On the basis of the comprehensive development of production, the average income of commune members increased by 23% compared to 1957.

    Last year's Great Leap Forward and the current rectification movement have further raised the communist consciousness of commune members, and a larger leap forward plan has been formulated for this year. This year, the county's grain yield per mu is required to reach 1,100 jin, an increase of nearly 150% compared to last year; soybeans are to reach a yield of 340 jin per mu, an increase of 79% compared to last year; and the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will also increase several times over. Under the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, the total output value of commune-run industries will increase by more than five times compared to last year, reaching 7.04 million yuan.

    This year, the county will supply the state with about 180 million jin of grain, 39 million jin of soybeans, as well as large quantities of timber, Guandong tobacco, fattened pigs, fresh eggs, fresh fish, and precious mountain products and medicinal materials.

    When discussing the plan, the commune members recognized that this year, with the people's communes, there are more people and greater strength, all the land has been deeply plowed, and fertilizer has increased more than four times. With the addition of reducing ridges and increasing rows for close planting, it is certain that the plan can be realized. Now the leap forward plan has become a huge driving force, promoting a mass movement centered on accumulating, manufacturing, and delivering fertilizer to fully implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." According to statistics from February 26, the county has accumulated more than 92 million dan of various fertilizers, and some fertilizers have already been delivered to the fields. There are 171 local chemical fertilizer plants in the county, producing large quantities of local chemical fertilizers and phosphorus bacterial fertilizers. At the same time, the repair of reservoirs, dams, and wells is being stepped up. It is planned that the original projects can store more than 170 million cubic meters of water, which can basically ensure the drought resistance of all paddy and dry land. Iron and wood farm tool factories are vigorously manufacturing, reforming, and repairing various farm tools. Basket weavers are rushing to weave bamboo baskets for indoor seedling raising, and seed disinfection work will begin soon.

    In order to fully realize the leap forward plan, the county party committee has arranged the rural labor force, and at the same time, has generally begun to establish various responsibility systems, and has made every effort to make the wage system conform to the principle of distribution according to work.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of production, the county party committee decided that leaders of the county, communes, and management areas must cultivate experimental plots well, and cadres above the deputy ministers of the county party committee must take turns going to the countryside to be commune members for one month, and cadres of the management area must each do 90 workdays throughout the year. Continue to adhere to the leadership system of the main leaders of the county being responsible for a specific area and each department and commission being responsible for a management area, and strengthen the leadership of the grass roots in a down-to-earth manner.

    Jiaohe County has issued a proposal to Jilin Province to carry out a mu-yield-thousand-jin competition and an all-round great revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. (Li Shugong)

    (Our Jiaohe Dispatch, March 6) Welfare units such as nurseries, public canteens, and sewing groups in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, are carrying out the "Ten Members" competition, doing everything possible to do a good job in welfare work, and contributing to the realization of the county's leap forward target of a thousand jin per mu.

    In order to create favorable conditions for the realization of the county's leap forward target, eleven welfare workers from six management areas including Tiangang issued a proposal to the county's welfare workers at the end of January to carry out the "Ten Members" competition (the ten members are: canteen managers, cooks, grain and rice processors, nursery staff, educators, sewing workers, barbers, service personnel, health care workers, and midwives), putting forward the competition conditions for various welfare tasks.

    After extensive publicity and study and discussion by welfare units, the competition has gradually unfolded. More than 900 nurseries and kindergartens throughout the county have universally strengthened the education and care of children, making the children more and more polite, more and more hygienic, and the incidence of illness has been greatly reduced. The nursery in Xinhe Village, Tiangang Management Area, often invites health centers to check the children's health and prevent infectious diseases in time, such as boiling "purple gromwell root" water for the children to drink, so that all the children in the nursery have avoided infectious diseases such as measles. Mothers of children who have not yet entered the nursery saw that the nursery took such good care of the children, and took the initiative to ask to send their children to the nursery. Now the number of children in this nursery has increased from more than 20 to 67.

    The more than 960 public canteens throughout the county, under the slogan of "Guaranteeing that commune members eat well, eat their fill, eat hot food, and eat economically," have been running better and better. In order not to delay the commune members' labor and rest, all canteens universally prepare meals in advance, allowing commune members to eat as soon as they arrive. Although there are many people in the canteen of the Second Brigade of the Huangsongdian Management Area, the phenomenon of crowding has been completely eliminated. The Qidaohe team of the Tiangang Management Area changed the method of queuing to buy food, and as soon as the commune members entered the canteen, the cooks immediately brought the food. Many canteens have also actively improved the methods of making meals, increased the variety, and paid attention to economy. At the same time, they are actively preparing for this year's vegetable production.

    In order for commune members to change seasons in a timely manner, wear well-fitting clothes and shoes, and have timely haircuts, the management areas generally implement advanced methods of tailors going to the door and barbers going to the households.

    The Jiaohe County Party Committee and the welfare departments actively supported and led the "Ten Members" competition movement, and successively held several telephone meetings, broadcast meetings, and on-site meetings, and conducted inspections and exchanged experiences in a timely manner. Through this competition, the consciousness of the welfare workers has been greatly improved, and the commune members have further realized that welfare work is glorious, enhancing the unity between the welfare workers and the masses, which has not only improved the welfare work, but also promoted the preparation for farming work. At present, the "Ten Members" competition movement is continuing to develop in depth and in a balanced manner. It is planned that a comparison and reward will be conducted by the end of March.

    前后方协力争取全面跃进
    蛟河县展开千斤丰产和“十员”竞赛运动
    本报蛟河6日电　吉林省1958年粮食单位产量最高的蛟河县，今年决心在去年增产的基础上，再翻一番。这个县制订了农林牧副渔五业全线大革命的规划，向全省各市县提出了开展亩产千斤的竞赛倡议。
    蛟河县人民在去年发挥了冲天的干劲，使粮食的亩产量达到四百五十三斤，比1957年翻了一番以上；由于公社全面发展生产，使丰富的资源初步得到利用，林、副、渔业和工业的产植，都比1957年增长一倍半左右。在生产全面发展的基础上，社员平均收入比1957年增长23％。
    去年的大跃进和当前的整社运动，进一步提高了社员的共产主义觉悟，制订了今年更大的跃进规划。今年全县粮食亩产要求达到一千一百斤，比去年增长近一倍半；大豆要达到亩产三百四十斤，比去年增长79％；林业、牧业、副业、渔业的产值也都要成倍增长。在实行工农业同时并举的方针下，社办工业总产值将比去年增长五倍以上，达到七百零四万元。
    今年全县将供应国家粮食一亿八千万斤左右，大豆三千九百万斤，以及大量的木材、关东烟、肥猪、鲜蛋、鲜鱼和珍贵的山货药材等。
    社员们讨论规划时认清了今年有了人民公社，人多力量大，土地全部深翻了，粪肥增加四倍多，加上缩垅增行搞密植，所以实现规划是有把握的。现在跃进规划已经成为巨大的动力，推动了一个以积肥造肥送肥为中心的全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的群众运动。据2月26日统计，全县已积各种肥九千二百多万担，部分肥料已经送到地里。全县土化肥厂有一百七十一处，生产出大量的土化肥和磷细菌肥。与此同时，正在加紧修补水库、拦河坝和打井，计划连原有工程可蓄水一亿七千多万公方，基本上能保证全部水旱田的抗旱用水。铁木农具厂正大力制造、改革和修配各种农具。编匠们正在赶编室内育苗用的箩筐，种子消毒工作将着手进行。
    为了全面地实现跃进规划，县委对农村劳动力作了安排，同时普遍开始建立各种责任制，并尽力使工资制度符合按劳分配的原则。
    为了加强对生产的领导，县委决定，县、公社和管理区的领导人必须种好试验田，县委正副部长以上干部要轮流下乡当一个月社员，管理区的干部每人全年要做九十个劳动日。继续坚持县的主要负责人包片、各部委包管理区的领导制度，踏踏实实地加强对基层的领导。
    蛟河县已向吉林全省发出了开展亩产千斤和农林牧副渔五业全线大革命的竞赛倡议　　（李树功）
    本报蛟河6日电　吉林省蛟河县的托儿所、公共食堂和缝纫组等福利单位开展“十员”竞赛，千方百计地搞好福利工作，为全县实现亩产千斤的跃进指标贡献力量。
    为了给实现全县跃进指标创造有利条件，天岗等六个管理区的十一名福利工作人员，在1月底向全县福利工作人员发出开展“十员”竞赛倡议书（十员是：食堂管理员、炊事员、粮米加工员、保育员、教养员、缝纫员、理发员、服务员、保健员和接生员），提出了各项福利工作的竞赛条件。
    经过广泛宣传和福利单位的学习讨论以后，竞赛已逐步展开。全县九百多个托儿所和幼儿园普遍加强了对孩子的教育和护理，使孩子们越来越有礼貌、越讲卫生，生病率大大减少。天岗管理区新开河屯的托儿所，经常请卫生所给孩子检查身体，及时预防传染病，如熬“紫草根”水给孩子喝等，使所里所有孩子都避免了麻疹等传染病。未入所的孩子的妈妈们看到托儿所带孩子这样好，都主动要求送孩子入托儿所。现在这个所的孩子已由二十多名增加到六十七名。
    全县的九百六十多个公共食堂，在“保证社员吃好、吃饱、吃得热呼、吃得省”的口号下，伙食越办越好了。各食堂为了不耽误社员们劳动和休息，普遍地提前准备饭，让社员们随到随吃。黄松甸管理区第二大队的食堂人虽然很多，但完全消灭了拥挤现象。天岗管理区七道河小队改变了排队买饭的办法，只要社员一进食堂，炊事员马上端上饭菜。许多食堂还积极改进饭菜做法，增加花样，注意节约。同时积极作好今年蔬菜生产的准备工作。
    为了使社员们适时换季，穿上合身的衣履和适时理发，各管理区普遍实行裁缝上门、理发到户的先进方法。
    中共蛟河县委和福利部门，积极支持和领导了“十员”竞赛运动，先后开过数次电话会、广播会和现场会，及时进行了检查和交流了经验。通过这次竞赛，大大提高了福利工作人员的觉悟，使社员们进一步认识到福利工作是光荣的，增强了福利工作人员和群众的团结，既改进了福利工作，又推动了备耕工作。目前，“十员”竞赛运动正继续向深入向平衡方面发展。计划到3月末，将进行一次评比和奖励。
