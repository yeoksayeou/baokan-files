    These days, our country is commemorating the heroic days of the Hungarian workers' movement, commemorating the unforgettable events of the glorious Hungarian Soviet Republic. Thousands of forms of commemoration, such as films, dramas, poems, paintings, exhibitions, and the vivid talks of the old soldiers of the heroic days, are all praising the glory of this era. The Executive Committee of the Communist International wrote in a letter to Béla Kun: "The achievements of the Hungarian Soviet government and the Hungarian Communist Party will always be an example in terms of the courage of the proletariat, and the foresight and wisdom of the Communists." All the working people of our country recall the days of 1919 with pride, recall the heroic struggles of our people under the leadership of the Communists, and sing with joy together with the old soldiers who participated in the great struggle.

    The joy and happiness of liberation add luster to the magnificent commemorative festival. After enduring twenty-five years of bloody counter-revolutionary cruelty, our people have won today's regime, created a new world, a new life, and are firmly moving forward on the path pointed out by the glorious 1919.

    This road closely links Hungary and its eternal friend, the Soviet Union. It was the first follower of the Soviet Union. In 1919, an eternal fighting friendship was formed with the revolutionary people of the Russian Soviet Republic. The Hungarian proletariat and poor peasants remained loyal to this fighting friendship throughout the dark years of oppression. The Soviet people have never forgotten this fighting friendship. If the imperialists were able to prevent Soviet Russia from providing assistance to the Hungarian proletariat in 1919, then by 1945, no force could resist the Red Army, which was fighting for freedom all over the world, from advancing. The old comrades-in-arms brought freedom to the Hungarian people at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice, and since then the Hungarian people have regained power. The Soviet Union provided political and economic support, helping to strengthen the regime of the Hungarian people. When the imperialists and their domestic lackeys used the mistakes of the past leadership to instigate a shameful counter-revolution in October 1956, the Soviet Union stood with us, and Soviet soldiers defended our socialist regime and national independence with bloodshed and sacrifice. When our people commemorate 1919, commemorate the old heroic soldiers of the Party and the working class, and commemorate a nation's brave socialist revolution, they should commemorate the great friendship forged with the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, because this is a blood oath that will last forever.

    How was the Hungarian Soviet Republic born?

    The storm of October 1918 destroyed the Habsburg Empire. Hungary broke away from Austria, which had ruled it for four hundred years. At the same time, the minority areas inhabited by Slovaks, Romanians, and Yugoslavs also broke away from Hungary. These nationalities were originally oppressed by the Hungarian nobles under the control of Austrian aristocrats and with their permission and support. The Hungarian people declared the establishment of a republic, but power fell into the hands of the liberal bourgeoisie who wanted to save the empire and were forced to recognize the republic only under the pressure of the people. The main pillar of the liberal bourgeoisie was the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, who formed a coalition government with them. This coalition government suffered a complete failure in domestic and foreign affairs. It opposed the workers who occupied the factories and the peasants who confiscated the land, maintained the rule of capitalists and landlords, but was unable to defend national independence, because it tried its best to cater to the victorious imperialist powers, who trampled on the sovereignty of this newly independent country. It also attempted to use the creation of illusions about the "democracy" and "spirit of assistance" of the plundering Entente states to prevent the high tide of proletarian revolutionary forces. The ruthless exposure of these illusions and the rapid growth of proletarian revolutionary forces quickly brought the coalition government of liberals and right-wing Social Democrats to an end.

    On March 21, 1919, the proletariat, united to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, announced the establishment of the Soviet Republic, establishing the second socialist country in Europe. Factories, mines, and banks became public property, and land was returned to the hands of the tillers. The palaces of culture and art opened their doors to the children of the people, and the villas of the nobles became the property of workers and their children.

    The establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic was an important historical event in the international workers' movement. As the first follower of the Russian Soviet Republic, one of its important international significance was that it strengthened the ranks of socialist revolutionary fighters throughout Europe, strengthened the unity of the world's workers and the influence of the mobilization power of Soviet Russia, and enhanced the prestige and attractiveness of the Marxist-Leninist ideology of proletarian revolution among the proletarian and poor peasant masses in capitalist countries.

    When Lenin mentioned the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic at the Eighth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on March 23, 1919, he said: "Comrades, the Hungarian revolution has encountered great difficulties and may be strangled by the imperialists, but no matter what difficulties Hungary encounters, in addition to the victory of the Soviet regime here, we have also achieved a moral victory." The Hungarian liberal bourgeoisie, which could neither satisfy the plundering demands repeatedly put forward by the Entente imperialists, nor resist the Entente powers, was no longer able to do anything about the proletarian revolution. In this case, the bourgeoisie peacefully transferred power to the proletariat, which was united to establish the proletarian regime, without resistance. Lenin gave a very high evaluation to the political and moral significance of this fact, that is, the bourgeoisie admitted: "In the biggest crisis, when a new war threatens a country that has been exhausted in the war, the establishment of the Soviet regime is a historical necessity, and it admits: in such a country, besides the Soviet regime of the dictatorship of the proletariat, no other regime is possible."

    The great international significance of the birth of the Soviet Republic also lies in the fact that during an extremely difficult period, when the Entente powers were attacking Soviet Russia from several directions, the Hungarian Soviet Republic greatly reduced the burden on Soviet Russia for several months, and contained a large part of the Entente's invading forces. The original plan of the Entente imperialists was to launch an attack on Soviet Russia from the Hungarian side as well. The existence of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the heroic actions of the Hungarian Red Army thwarted this step.

    After the Hungarian Soviet Republic was overthrown, the Communist International called on the proletarians of the world to unite more firmly under the banner of communism. The call of the world's proletariat said: We have achieved great victories in this struggle of great historical significance, but we have also suffered serious losses. Bloody facts have pointed out to us that in countries where Soviet power has been established, the victory of counter-revolution cannot last long. The Communist International called on the proletariat of Hungary to maintain calm, fortitude and perseverance. The call said: "Comrades, get up and work to immediately organize underground communist parties!" The Hungarian Communists accepted this advice from the Communist International. They carried out twenty-five years of underground struggle in order to re-establish the people's regime in Hungary.

    The struggle of the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian working people in 1919 was not in vain. The best and most loyal sons of the Hungarian people—the Communists—and the left-wing socialists who fought alongside them—used the training and experience they had received during the Soviet Republic to continue to struggle for a better future for the people. The people, workers, and poor peasants of the whole country never forgot what the people's regime had brought them in such a short period. After the Soviet army liberated our country in 1945, the possibility of re-establishing the people's regime was presented. The Hungarian working class was strengthened due to the close cooperation between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party under the leadership of the left wing. They used the experience of 1919 to win the victory of the socialist revolution for the second time. In the flames of the political struggle from 1945 to 1948, the unity of the working class was further developed in the unremitting struggle against right-wing opportunists. This is one of the decisive conditions for the second victory of the socialist revolution, and one of the decisive conditions for the struggle to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Due to the merger of the two working-class parties, the dictatorship of the proletariat was fully realized.

    In 1919, the two working-class parties had also merged, and the merged Socialist Communist Party took over the leadership of the Soviet Republic. The merger of the two parties was carried out after the Social Democratic Party accepted the principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat under the demands of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party and the pressure of the masses. However, the merger of 1919 contained serious errors. Within the merged party, there were right-wing opportunists who later became internal enemies of the proletarian regime, traitors to the proletarian regime, lackeys of the Entente powers and domestic counter-revolution, and the most dangerous internal saboteurs of the proletarian regime. The Hungarian proletariat learned a lesson from this experience, which had been paid for at a high price. In 1948, when the party was merged, the right-wing Social Democrats who opposed the proletarian regime were purged. When the two parties merged in 1948, the Social Democratic Party not only accepted the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, but also purged the elements who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, or at least eliminated the vast majority of them. In 1956, when the domestic and foreign reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary riot, and Nagy Imre and his accomplices took advantage of the counter-revolutionary riot and double-dealing conspiracies to sneak into the government, the right-wing Social Democrats also hurried to offer sacrifices on the altar of the counter-revolution. They came out again to play their past roles, trying to re-split the working class. Their conspiracy failed and died with the counter-revolutionary riot. The former right-wing Social Democrats joined forces with the "national communists" of the Nagy Imre clique, attacked the proletarian revolution from behind, and served the counter-revolution. The former left-wing Social Democrats joined forces with the Communists to jointly defend the working class regime, just like in 1919, but now all boundaries have disappeared between them, and they are integrated in the flames of struggle.

    In 1956, when the counter-revolution broke out, it was the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who had taken up arms to oppose international imperialism and defend the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 who first took up arms to defend the people's democratic system. Standing together with the experienced old soldiers and revolutionaries were also a generation that had suffered deeply in the two world wars, the Communists who had been tempered in the years of underground struggle, and the organized workers. Their united strength defeated the counter-revolution.

    In 1919, standing at the forefront of the Hungarian Soviet Republic were the revolutionaries who had participated in the Russian people's revolution. The former Russian prisoners of war fought in the Hungarian Red Army, providing the Hungarian people with rich revolutionary traditions and glorious examples. In 1956, it was the people who had learned revolutionary struggle in 1919 who came forward to defend the people's regime.

    Today, as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, we, as a member of the socialist camp, have never been as consolidated as we are today. We are no longer isolated and helpless. With us are the people of various people's democratic countries, the two major socialist powers, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the faithful neighbors Czechoslovakia and Romania, and other countries in the socialist camp. They stand with us to commemorate the Hungarian Soviet Republic of forty years ago.

    Today, as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic created by our predecessors, our Party is stronger, more united, and more consolidated than ever before. Our people's democracy has experienced the shock of the counter-revolution and is looking forward to the future with confidence. We will fully support the great struggle of the world's workers' movement until final victory.

    匈牙利苏维埃共和国的国际意义
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央书记、政治局委员　马罗山
    这几天我国正在纪念匈牙利工人运动的英雄日子，纪念光荣的匈牙利苏维埃共和国难忘的事迹。电影、戏剧、诗歌、绘画、展览会等成千种纪念形式以及英雄时日的老战士的生动的谈话，都在歌颂这一时代的光荣。共产国际执行委员会给孔·贝拉的信中曾经这样写道：“匈牙利苏维埃政府和匈牙利共产党的建树，在无产阶级的胆略、共产党人的远见和智慧方面将永远是个榜样。”我国全体劳动人民都以自豪的心情回忆1919年的日子，回忆在共产党人领导下的我国人民的英勇斗争，并以欢欣鼓舞的心情同参加过伟大斗争的老战士们一起歌颂。
    解放的欢乐和幸福为壮丽的纪念节日增添了光彩。我国人民在二十五年血腥的反革命的残酷岁月中饱受折磨后，争取到了今天的政权，创建了新世界、新生活，并坚定地在光荣的1919年所指出的道路上向前迈进。
    这条道路使匈牙利和它的永恒的朋友——苏联紧密地连结起来。它曾是苏联的第一个追随者。1919年与俄罗斯苏维埃共和国的革命人民结成了永恒的战斗友谊，匈牙利的无产阶级和贫农在受压迫的黑暗年代中也是一直忠实于这一战斗友谊的。苏联人民也永远没有忘记这一战斗友谊。如果说帝国主义者在1919年能够阻止了苏维埃俄国给予匈牙利无产阶级援助的话，那么到1945年就已经没有任何力量能够抵挡为全世界自由而斗争的红军向前推进了。老战友以流血牺牲的代价为匈牙利人民带来了自由，从此匈牙利人民又掌握了政权。苏联在政治和经济上给予了支持，帮助加强了匈牙利人民的政权。当1956年10月帝国主义者和国内的仆从们利用过去领导的错误策动了可耻的反革命时，苏联和我们站在一起，苏联的战士经过流血牺牲保卫了我们的社会主义政权和民族独立。当我国人民纪念1919年，纪念党和工人阶级老的英勇战士，纪念一个民族勇敢的社会主义革命时，就要纪念同第一个社会主义国家——苏联结成的伟大友谊，因为这是万世永存的血盟。
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国是怎样诞生的？
    1918年10月的风暴摧毁了哈布斯堡帝国，匈牙利脱离了四百年来一直受它统治的奥地利，同时，那些斯洛伐克人、罗马尼亚人和南斯拉夫人居住的少数民族地区也脱离了匈牙利，而这些民族原是在奥地利贵族控制下并在他们的允许和支持下受匈牙利的贵族压迫的。匈牙利人民宣布成立了共和国，然而政权却落在想挽救帝国、只是在人民的压力下才被迫承认共和国的自由资产阶级手中。自由资产阶级的主要支柱是与他们组成联合政府的社会民主党的右翼首脑人物。这一联合政府在内政和外交方面遭到了彻底的失败，它反对占领工厂的工人和没收土地的农民，维护资本家和地主的统治，然而却无力保卫民族独立，因为它极力逢迎取得胜利的帝国主义强权，而这些帝国主义国家却践踏这一刚刚取得自主的国家的主权。它又妄图利用制造对劫掠成性的协约国国家的“民主”和“援助精神”的幻想，来阻止无产阶级革命力量的高张。对这些幻想的无情揭露和无产阶级革命力量的迅速增长，使自由派和右翼社会民主党人的联合政府很快就完蛋了。
    1919年3月21日为建立无产阶级专政而统一起来的无产阶级宣布成立了苏维埃共和国，建立了欧洲第二个社会主义国家，工厂、矿山、银行成为公有财产了，土地也归还到耕者的手中。文化艺术之宫对人民的子弟敞开了大门，贵族的别墅也为工人和工人子女所有了。
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国的成立是国际工人运动的重要历史事件，作为俄罗斯苏维埃共和国第一个追随者，其重大国际意义之一是：在整个欧洲加强了社会主义革命战士的行列，加强了世界工人的团结和苏维埃俄国的动员力量的影响，并且提高了无产阶级革命的马克思列宁主义思想在资本主义国家无产阶级和贫农群众中的威信和吸引力。
    列宁在1919年3月23日苏联共产党第八次代表大会上提到匈牙利苏维埃共和国的成立时这样说到：“同志们，匈牙利的革命遭到极大的困难，可能受到帝国主义者的扼杀，但是，无论匈牙利将遇到如何的困难，除了我们这里的苏维埃政权取得胜利外，我们又取得了道义上的胜利”。既不能满足协约国的帝国主义者所一再提出的掠夺要求，更不能对协约国进行反抗的匈牙利的自由资产阶级，对无产阶级的革命也已无能为力了。在这种情况下，资产阶级没有经过反抗就和平地把政权转交给为建立无产阶级政权而统一起来的无产阶级了。列宁对这一事实的政治上和道义上的意义给予极高的评价，就是资产阶级承认：“在最大的危机中，当新的战争又威胁着一个在战争中已精疲力竭的国家时，建立苏维埃政权是历史的必然，它承然：在这样一个国家中，除了无产阶级专政的苏维埃政权外，别的政权是不可能的”。
    苏维埃共和国诞生的伟大国际意义还在于：在极端困难的时期中，当协约国从几方面进攻苏维埃俄国的时候，匈牙利苏维埃共和国在几个月中大大地减轻了苏维埃俄国的负担，牵制了协约国侵略军的很大一部分力量。协约国帝国主义者原来的计划是，从匈牙利方面也向苏维埃俄国发动进攻。匈牙利苏维埃共和国的存在，匈牙利红军的英勇行为，阻挠了他们的这一步骤。
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国被颠复后，共产国际号召全世界无产者，更坚决地团结在共产主义旗帜下面。全世界无产阶级的号召书说：我们在这一具有伟大历史意义的斗争中取得了巨大的胜利，但是也遭受了严重的损失。血腥的事实向我们指出了，在曾经成立过苏维埃政权的国家里，反革命的胜利是不可能持久的。共产国际号召匈牙利的无产阶级要保持镇定、刚毅和坚韧不拔的精神。号召书说：“同志们，为了立即组织地下的共产党，起来工作吧！”匈牙利的共产党人接受了共产国际的这一忠告。为了在匈牙利重新建立人民政权，他们进行了二十五年的地下斗争。
    匈牙利工人阶级和匈牙利劳动人民1919年的斗争不是白费的。匈牙利人民最优秀、最忠实的儿子——共产党人以及同他们并肩作战的左翼社会主义者——运用在苏维埃共和国时期所受到的锻炼和取得的经验，继续不断地为人民更美好的未来进行了斗争。全国人民、工人、贫农永远没有忘记，人民政权在这样短的时期内给他们带来了什么。1945年苏军解放我国后，展现了重新创立人民政权的可能性，匈牙利工人阶级由于共产党和在左翼领导下的社会民主党的紧密合作而得到加强，他们利用1919年的经验，第二次赢得了社会主义革命的胜利。在1945——1948年政治斗争的烈火中，在反对右倾机会主义分子的不懈的斗争中，工人阶级的团结得到了进一步的发展。这是社会主义革命第二次取得胜利的决定性条件之一，这是为建立无产阶级专政的斗争的决定性条件之一。由于两个工人阶级政党的合并，无产阶级专政得到了完全的实现。
    在1919年两个工人阶级政党也曾经合并过，合并起来的社会主义共产党掌握了苏维埃共和国的领导。两党合并是在社会民主党左翼的要求和群众的压力下，社会民主党接受了无产阶级专政的原则后进行的。但是，1919年的合并包含有严重的错误。在合并后的党内，存在着右倾机会主义分子，他们后来变成了无产阶级政权的内部敌人、无产阶级政权的叛徒、协约国和国内反革命的走狗、无产阶级政权最危险的内部破坏者。匈牙利无产阶级从这一个曾经付出很高代价的经验中吸取了教训，1948年在合并党的时候，清除了反对无产阶级政权的右翼社会民主党人。1948年两党合并时，社会民主党不仅接受了马克思列宁主义的基本原则，同时还清除了反对无产阶级专政的分子，至少是清除他们的绝大多数。1956年，当国内外反动派发动了反革命暴乱，纳吉·伊姆雷及其同伙借助于反革命暴乱和两面三刀的阴谋手法钻进了政府的时候，右翼社会民主党人也赶忙在反革命的神坛上献供。他们又出来扮演过去的角色，企图重新分裂工人阶级。他们的阴谋遭到失败，同反革命暴乱一起复亡。过去的右翼社会民主党人同纳吉·伊姆雷之流的“民族共产主义者”结成一条战线，从背面向无产阶级革命进攻，为反革命服务。而过去的左翼社会民主党人同共产党人结成一条战线，共同保卫工人阶级的政权，同1919年一样，但是现在在他们之间已经消失了一切界线，他们在斗争的烈火中融合在一起了。
    1956年当反革命爆发的时候，首先拿起武器来保卫人民民主制度的，是那些在1919年拿起武器来反对国际帝国主义，保卫匈牙利苏维埃共和国的工人、农民和知识分子。同具有丰富经验的老战士和革命家站在一起的还有在两次世界大战中深受苦难的一代人，在地下斗争年代中锻炼出来的共产党人和有组织的工人，他们团结一致的力量战胜了反革命。
    1919年站在匈牙利苏维埃共和国前列的，是那些曾经参加过俄国人民革命的革命家。过去俄国的战俘，在匈牙利红军中作战，他们为匈牙利人民提供了丰富的革命传统和光辉的榜样。1956年挺身出来保卫人民政权的，是那些在1919年学会革命斗争的人们。
    今天，当我们庆祝匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年的时候，我们作为社会主义阵营的一员，从来没有像今天这样巩固。我们不再是孤零无依的了，同我们在一起的有各人民民主国家的人民，有两个社会主义大国苏联和中华人民共和国，有忠实的友邻捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚以及社会主义阵营其他各国。它们同我们站在一起，共同纪念四十年前的匈牙利苏维埃共和国。
    今天，当我们纪念我们先辈所缔造的匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年的时候，我们党比从前任何时候都更加强大，更加团结，更加巩固。我们的人民民主经历了反革命的震荡，正充满信心地展望着将来。我们将以全力支持世界工人运动的伟大斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。
