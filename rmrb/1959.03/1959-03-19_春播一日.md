A Day of Spring Planting
Written collectively by our reporters stationed in Hunan

Hunan proverb: “Awakening of Insects, the frog’s birthday.” This means that once the “Awakening of Insects” comes, the insects come out of the soil, the frogs begin to croak, spring returns to the earth, and all things revive. In the first spring after the people's communes were established, the fields of Hunan's vast countryside were filled with golden rapeseed flowers and lush green wheat. In many places, there were magnificent scenes of enriching mountains and seas and vigorously carrying out spring plowing and production. This year's spring plowing and production started earlier, on a larger scale, and with more solid and meticulous work than in any previous year.

On this day of the "Awakening of Insects," although some areas had wind and rain, the heroic people were still fighting in the fields. From the shores of Dongting Lake to the foothills of the Five Ridges, there was a bustling crowd, with vehicles flowing like water and horses like dragons, busily engaged in production. One group of people was accumulating and transporting fertilizer to the fields, another group was plowing rice seedling fields, and still others were cultivating spring-harvested crops such as rapeseed. From morning till night, there was a busy scene of spring plowing and production everywhere.

	Leading Cadres in the Fields

In the fields of Sifen People's Commune in Liling County, the sound of voices was deafening, and the commune members were busily turning over pond fertilizer. Among the working crowd was Comrade Su Dezong, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, who was sent down to this commune in December last year to serve as the First Secretary of the Party Committee. Working in the fields with the commune members has become Lao Su's most enjoyable thing and an indispensable part of his work. Half a month ago, he and the commune members were accumulating fertilizer in the experimental fields when they saw that not many people were showing up for work. What was the reason? After discussing it with some commune members, he found that the allocation of labor in the commune was not rational enough, with many strong laborers being used in service work, and too many people being used in industry. Now, more than 600 laborers have been added to the agricultural front in the entire commune.

Today, when Su Dezong was turning over pond fertilizer, commune member Huang Bingfan told him that there was a lot of pond fertilizer this year, but there was less ash, how to solve this problem? This posed another question for Su Dezong. The reason was that collective dining reduced firewood burning, which of course resulted in less ash.

In the evening, Su Dezong returned from the fields and went to the commune's agricultural science institute, asking them to do a good job in fertilizer testing and soil survey so as to apply fertilizer reasonably and strive to double the rice yield compared to last year.

	Busy Dredging for Fertilizer in Dongting Lake

On this day of the Awakening of Insects, drizzle was falling on Dongting Lake, and a northwest wind of force five or six was howling, causing huge waves in the lake. On this windy and rainy day, thousands of boats set sail, going to collect silk grass for fertilizer. On Ying Lake in Changde County, which covers an area of one hundred li, more than 3,000 members of the fertilizer accumulation expedition team set up more than 140 camps along the lake. The fertilizer accumulation competition here has been going on for twelve days. This day of the Awakening of Insects was the day of the grand evaluation of the fertilizer dredging competition here. The 229 commune members of the Yingwu Brigade were the first to go to work today, driving 154 small boats. The mobile red flag that had been planted on their bows a few days ago had been snatched by the Guotai Brigade, and the commune members were determined to win back the red flag today. They adopted the method of dredging and transporting at the same time, transporting the silk grass to the fields as soon as possible. On this day, the entire team dredged more than 1,200 cubic meters of silk grass and brought it to the fields, winning the red flag.

	Busy Planting in Lingnan

In the people's communes of Yizhang County, south of the Five Ridges, a high tide of planting was launched. The weeds on the ridges and edges of the fields were cleared, the耕牛耕牛 ploughed back and forth, the moist rice seedling fields had been leveled, and the early-planted seedlings were already a tender green.

On this day, the Chengnan People's Commune had already put the early rice seed grains into the mud; however, they heard a forecast that a cold wave was coming, so they immediately launched a competition to mix ash fertilizer with the seeds and protect the seedlings. Commune member Wu Duojian initiated a competition to prepare ash fertilizer for three mu of rice seedling fields per person per day, and commune member Li Xinmin proposed a guarantee of preparing ash fertilizer for four mu of fields per day. On this day, the commune members cut down more than 4,500 bundles of thatch and more than 250 bundles of branches from the mountains, and also collected more than 2,000 old sun-drying mats from various households, busily setting up windbreaks and wind sheds for the rice seedling fields, just like mothers protecting their babies.

	Good Spring Scenery in Miao Villages

On this day, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture were busy plowing, transporting fertilizer to the fields, and planting early corn. In this great leap forward spring, stories of unity in production among the Tujia, Miao, and Han brothers were circulating everywhere.

The more than one-li-long high-altitude cableway jointly built by the Miao and Han commune members of the Sanjiaoyan People's Commune on the banks of the Xiongdi River, symbolizing ethnic unity, was turning particularly frequently today. They were transporting fertilizer dug from the fertile mountains of the Miao villages, basket after basket, through the cableway to the rice fields of the Han mountain villages. On this day, the Miao farmers of La'erpu Mountain Village on the banks of the Xiongdi River were particularly busy transporting fertilizer. They had to complete seven days' worth of work in four days so as to free up three days to support the neighboring Han mountain village in planting early corn. After communization, the farmers of these two mountain villages became members of the Sanjiaoyan People's Commune and were closely united in production.

	Workers Rushing to Make Farm Tools

At dawn, as soon as the work bell rang at the farm tool factory of the Jilongjie People's Commune in Hengnan County, the various workshops were boiling. The workers of this factory were carrying out a large-scale competition to rush to manufacture and repair farm tools to support spring plowing and production.

Forty-one workers, carrying “furnace loads,” had already set off, facing the morning light. They were going to the fields and production teams to repair farm tools. All twelve iron furnaces in the iron workshop were blazing brightly. Today, this workshop adopted the "cooperative rush manufacturing fast method" to make hoes. The most enthusiastic were the two furnaces of Zou Fansheng and Zhang Kaiyi. When Zou Fansheng clamped a red-hot piece of iron from the furnace to the anvil to make a hoe, Zhang Kaiyi and his assistant He Yisheng rushed to cooperate in hammering with a sledgehammer. When Zhang Kaiyi clamped out the red-hot piece of iron for making the hoe, Zou Fansheng and his assistant Wu Tianxin went to hammer in the same way. In this way, a hoe only needed fourteen furnace fires to make, which was ten furnace fires less than before, and the quality was also better. When this good news reached the carpentry workshop, this workshop used the "assembly line method" to rush to make carts to catch up with the iron workshop. The cooperation between the carpenters was even tighter. It only took ten workdays to build a cart, which increased work efficiency by 50% compared to one person making it completely. With frequent good news from the ironworkers and carpenters, the enthusiasm of the remaining foundry, bamboo, and sheet metal workshop workers burned even more vigorously, like adding fuel to the fire, and each came up with clever ways to improve work efficiency.

On this day, the entire factory manufactured and repaired more than 700 hoes, carts, and other items, which was 30% higher than the highest daily output since the beginning of the year.

    春播一日
    本报驻湖南记者集体采写
    湖南农谚：“惊蛰惊蛰，青蛙生日”。这就是说，“惊蛰”节一到，虫子出土了，青蛙叫起来了，春回大地，万物复苏。在人民公社化后的第一个春天，湖南广大农村田野里油菜花一片金黄，麦子葱绿长满田垅。许多地方出现了肥山肥海、大闹春耕生产的雄伟场面。今年的春耕生产较以往任何一年都动手早、规模大、工作扎实细致。
      “惊蛰”这一天，虽然有些地区刮风下雨，英雄的人民仍然在田野里战斗着。从洞庭湖滨到五岭山麓，到处人群鼎沸，车如流水马如龙，热热闹闹地搞生产。一群人在积肥运肥下田，另一群人正在翻耕秧田，还有些人在培育油菜等春收作物。从早到晚，到处呈现一片春耕生产的繁忙景象。
          领导干部在田间
    在醴陵县泗汾人民公社田野里，人声鼎沸，社员们都在热热闹闹地翻凼肥。劳动的人群里，有县委副书记粟德忠同志，他是去年12月下放到这个公社担任党委第一书记的。和社员们一起到田间劳动，已经成为老粟最愉快的事，也是他工作中不可缺少的内容。半个月前，他和社员们在试验田里积肥，看到出工的人不多，原因何在呢？和一些社员研究，发现公社里的劳动力安排不够合理，很多强壮的劳动力用在服务性的工作上，工业上也多用了一些人。现在，全公社农业战线上已增加六百多个劳动力。
    今天，粟德忠在翻凼肥时，社员黄炳凡告诉他，今年凼肥多，但是草木灰少，何如解决呢？这又给粟德忠提出了一个问题。原来是因为集体吃饭少烧柴，当然就少出灰。
    傍晚，粟德忠从田间回去，又走到公社的农业科学研究所，要求他们做好肥料的化验和土壤普查工作，以便合理施肥，争取稻谷产量比去年翻一番。
          洞庭湖里捞肥忙
    惊蛰这一天，洞庭湖上细雨纷飞，五六级的西北风刮得呼呼地叫，湖里翻起了巨浪。在这个风雨交加的日子里，湖上万船齐发，他们是去打捞丝草作肥料。在方圆一百华里的常德县鹰湖上，三千多名积肥远征队，沿湖扎起一百四十多个营棚，这里的积肥竞赛，已经持续了十二天了。惊蛰这天，是这里的捞肥竞赛大评比的一天。英武大队的二百二十九名社员，今天驾着一百五十四只小船最早出工。几天前插在他们船头上的流动红旗被国泰大队夺去了，社员们今天一定要把红旗夺回来，他们采取边捞、边运的办法，尽快地把丝草运下田。这一天，全队打捞一千二百多公方丝草下了田，赢得了红旗。
            岭南播种忙
    在五岭以南宜章县的各人民公社里，掀起了播种高潮。田埂地边的杂草铲得光光的，耕牛来回翻耕，湿润秧田已经整平，播种较早的秧苗已经一片嫩绿。
    这一天，城南人民公社已经将早稻种谷下了泥；但是，他们听到了寒潮将要到来的预报，于是立即展开了灰肥拌种、护秧保苗的竞赛运动。社员吴多见发起一天每人搞好三亩秧田灰肥的竞赛，社员李新民就提出一天搞四亩田灰肥的保证。这一天，社员们从山上砍下了四千五百多担茅柴和二百五十多担树枝，还从各家收集了两千多床旧晒席，忙着给秧田扎防风排、防风棚，真像母亲保护婴儿一样。
              苗寨春光好
    这一天，多山的湘西土家族苗族自治州的各族农民正忙碌地翻耕、运肥下田和播种早包谷。在这个大跃进的春天，到处流传着土、苗、汉族兄弟团结搞生产的故事。
    象征着民族大团结的兄弟河畔三角岩人民公社苗、汉族社员共同架起的一里多长的高空索道，今天转动得特别频繁。他们把从苗寨肥山上挖出来的肥料，满筐满筐地通过索道运到汉族山寨的稻田里。这一天，兄弟河畔腊尔朴山寨的苗族农民运肥特别忙，他们要在四天内完成七天的工作量，以便腾出三天时间去支援邻近汉族山寨播种早苞谷。这两个山寨的农民在公社化后，都成为三角岩人民公社的社员，紧密地团结在一起搞生产。
        赶制农具的工人们
    黎明，衡南县鸡笼街人民公社的农具厂的上班钟一响，各个车间就沸腾起来。这个厂的工人们正在开展赶制修配农具的比武大竞赛，支援春耕生产。
    四十一名工人挑着“炉担”，迎着晨光早就出发了。他们是到田间、到生产队去修整农具的。铁工车间的十二座铁炉，都是火光熊熊。这个车间今天是采用“协作赶制快速法”打锄头。最起劲的是邹凡生和张楷义那两座炉子。当邹凡生从炉中把一团烧得通红用来打锄的铁块夹到铁砧上时，张楷义和他的助手贺义生赶来协作打大锤。当张楷义把打锄头的铁块烧红夹出来后，邹凡生和他的助手伍田新同样去打锤。这样一把锄头只要打十四炉火就行了，比原来缩短了十炉火，质量还好。这个捷报传到了木工车间，这个车间就以“流水作业法”赶制板车，来追赶铁工车间。木工之间的协作搞得更紧凑了，造一辆板车只需十个工日，较原来一个人全面制作提高了工效50％。铁工、木工捷报频传，余下的翻砂、竹业、冷作等车间工人们的干劲，像火上添油烧得更旺，各自都想出了提高工效的巧妙办法。
    这一天，全厂共制造和修补了锄头、板车等共七百余件，比开年来最高的一天产量还提高了30％。
