    Thousand Machine-Hour System - The Road to Mechanical Abundance
    First Tractor Factory and others launch "Thousand Machine-Hour" competition, greatly increasing production
    (Our Reporter in Luoyang, 22nd) The workers of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant are tapping the potential of their equipment, using the "Thousand Machine-Hour" red flag competition as a starting point, and have launched a high-yield industrial production campaign, greatly increasing labor productivity.
    This year, the "Thousand Machine-Hour" campaign includes the fuel system, stamping, engine, wood mold, tool, machine repair, and electrical manufacturing workshops, with nearly five hundred machine tools participating. Among them, three hundred and twenty-seven machine tools have achieved a monthly output of over one thousand working hours. 80% of the machine tools in the tool workshop have surpassed this leap-forward target. The thirteen machine tools of the cutting division's Yao Changyou group have achieved an average monthly output of over three thousand working hours. They have already started working on the tasks for 1960. Yao Changyou's milling machine has achieved a monthly output of five thousand five hundred and thirty working hours, and this machine alone can process parts for nine other machines. Experience over the past few months has proven that the "Thousand Machine-Hour" campaign not only powerfully increases labor productivity but is also a good format for conducting collective competitions. Because the "Thousand Machine-Hour" competition is based on machine tools rather than individuals, it strengthens unity among people, closely coordinates machine tools with machine tools, processes with processes, and fosters a noble communist spirit of mutual concern and love for the collective enterprise. All machine tools have implemented a "three no-go" system, namely: do not leave if the replacement worker has not arrived, do not leave if the operating methods have not been clearly explained, and do not leave if the jigs and raw materials are not adequately prepared. They also implement full cooperation, with those with lower technical skills doing rough processing and those with higher technical skills doing precision processing. This has played a significant role in achieving balanced plan fulfillment. The 6H82 milling machine used to only complete about three hundred working hours per month. Since the launch of the "Thousand Machine-Hour" competition, with collective care and assistance, the output has increased month by month, eventually reaching five thousand machine-hours.
      The "Thousand Machine-Hour" competition has brought a strong demand for technological innovation and a desire to improve labor organization. This competition forces operators of each machine tool to use their brains to find technical and manpower solutions to achieve high output targets. In the competition, the Yao Changyou group carried out more than one hundred technological innovations to break the thousand machine-hour barrier. Fan Changsong and others from the planing group in the machine repair workshop made an "automatic centering table" for the machine tool in one day, completing eighty minutes of work in seven minutes. Participating groups have adjusted labor organization to increase monthly output per machine and greatly shorten auxiliary time.
    (Our Dispatch) A high-efficiency mass movement centered on technological revolution – the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement – is surging forward at the Dalian Hoisting Machinery Plant. This movement has mobilized the masses' soaring enthusiasm and boundless creative wisdom. With the goal of increasing labor productivity, it has driven the improvement of various management tasks and guaranteed the accelerated manufacture of key products. From March 6th, when the movement started, to the 13th, in just over a week, there were two hundred and eighteen cases of innovating tools, promoting advanced experience, and improving labor organization. One hundred and forty-two people reached the "Thousand Machine-Hour" target on a daily average, accounting for 42% of the total number of workers.
    This year, due to the even greater leap forward across the country, the demand for hoisting equipment has increased unprecedentedly. The vast majority of these cranes are key products supplied to the iron and steel, power station, and water conservancy projects. According to the preliminary plan arranged by the Dalian Hoisting Machinery Plant, the total tonnage of crane production this year will leap from more than 49,000 tons completed last year to around 100,000 tons. This creates a contradiction between heavy processing tasks and insufficient processing capacity. In late February, the general party branch of the plant's mechanical workshop was inspired by studying the experience of the Luoyang Tractor Factory in carrying out the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement, and decided to solve the difficulty of insufficient processing capacity by carrying out a high-efficiency "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement, starting with fully tapping the potential of existing equipment.
      After the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement met with the workers, it was immediately met with enthusiastic response. They wrote big-character posters, initiatives, and resolutions, and immediately began to discuss their planned targets and guarantee measures. According to the planned targets, the 121 machine tools in the workshop could complete an average of 1,026 working hours per month per machine tool. In peacetime, each machine tool could only complete more than 600 working hours of work per month. During the high-yield campaign in December last year, only 26 machine tools achieved more than 1,000 working hours for the entire month. In the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement, 85 machine tools reached more than "Thousand Machine-Hour".
    In order to achieve high output targets, the workshop quickly formed a high tide of technological revolution. In just over a week, the entire workshop created and promoted one hundred and thirty-five new tools, new operating methods, and advanced experiences. After hearing the mobilization report, Liu Zuoxu of the bearing box section immediately began to improve the jig, changing from loading one part at a time to loading seven parts at a time, greatly reducing auxiliary time. Ding Huiqing and Xing Qigeng, who worked on one machine tool, and Zhou Yuhan and Jiang Jinchi, who worked on another machine tool, both improved their tools and increased production efficiency by four to seven times. Since the launch of the "Thousand Machine-Hour" movement, lathe operator Guo Xiutian has increased the cutting depth and machine speed, and has completed an average of thirty hours of work per day. In order to achieve the "Thousand Machine-Hour" target, there has been unprecedented communist collaboration. At the same time, the labor organization has been reasonably adjusted between the three shifts of workers according to their technical level.

    千台时——机械丰产之路
    第一拖拉机厂等开展“千台时”竞赛产量大增
    本报洛阳22日电　第一拖拉机制造厂职工大挖设备潜力，以“千台时”红旗竞赛为起点，掀起了工业高额丰产运动，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    今年参加“千台时”运动的有燃料系统、冲压、发动机、木模、工具、机修、电气制造等车间，共有近五百台机床参加了运动，其中有三百二十七台机床月产量达到一千工时以上。工具车间有80％的机床突破了这个跃进指标。切削工部姚长有小组的十三台机床，平均月产量都超过了三千工时，现在他们已经开始做1960年的活。姚长有的铣床月产量达到了五千五百三十工时，这部床子可以单独对九部机床加工。几个月来的经验证明：“千台时”运动不仅有力地提高了劳动生产率，而且是开展集体竞赛的良好形式。由于“千台时”竞赛不以个人为基础，而以机床为基础，从而加强了人与人之间的团结，密切了机床与机床、工序与工序的协作关系，树立了人人互相关心，和热爱集体事业的共产主义的高尚风格。各台机床都实行了“三不走”制度，即：接班人不来不走，操作方法交代不清不走，卡具和毛坯准备不足不走。并实行通力合作，技术低的多做粗加工，技术高的多做精加工。这对均衡完成计划，起了很大作用。6H82铣床，过去每月只干三百个工时左右，展开“千台时”竞赛以来，在集体关怀和帮助下，产量月月提高，以至达到五千台时。
      “千台时”竞赛带来了技术革新的强烈要求，和改进劳动组织的愿望。这一竞赛迫使每一台机床的操作者从技术上和人力安排上动脑筋，找窍门来实现高产指标。姚长有小组在竞赛中，进行了一百多项技术革新，来突破千台时。机修车间刨工组范长松等在一天以内制成机床上的“自动定心台”，在七分钟内就完成八十分钟的任务。参加竞赛的小组，都为了提高台月工时产量，而调整了劳动组织，大大缩短了辅助时间。
    本报讯　一个以技术革命为中心的高效率群众运动——“千台时”运动，在大连起重机器厂澎湃汹涌地开展起来。这个运动调动了群众的冲天干劲和无穷的创造智慧，并以提高劳动生产率为目的，带动了各项管理工作的改进，保证了重点产品的加速制造。运动从3月6日开始到13日，仅一周多的时间就出现了二百一十八项革新工具、推广先进经验和改善劳动组织的事例，并有一百四十二人按日平均达到
  “千台时”指标，占参加劳动总人数的42％。
    今年，由于全国的更大跃进，对起重设备的需要量空前增加，其中绝大部分起重机是供应钢铁、电站、水利工程的重点产品。根据大连起重机器厂初步安排的计划，今年起重机生产的总吨位，将由去年完成的四万九千多吨跃进到十万吨左右，这样就形成了加工任务繁重和加工能力不足的矛盾。2月下旬，这个厂机械车间党总支从研究洛阳拖拉机厂开展“千台时”运动的经验中得到启发，决心通过开展高效率的“千台时”运动。从充分挖掘现有设备潜力着手，来解决加工能力不足的困难。
      “千台时”运动和工人见面后，立即得到热烈的响应，他们写了大字报、倡议书、决心书，并立即动手讨论自己的计划指标和保证措施。根据计划指标，车间一百二十一台机床平均每台机床每月可完成一千零二十六个工时。而平时，每台机床一个月只能完成六百多个工时的工作量。在去年12月份的高产运动中，全月达到一千工时以上的机床只有二十六台，在“千台时”运动中，达到“千台时”以上的机床就有八十五台。
    为了实现高产指标，车间很快形成了技术革命的高潮，仅一周多来，全车间就创造出和推广了一百三十五项新刀具、新操作方法和先进经验。轴承箱工段刘作绪听了动员报告后，立即动手改进卡具，把一次把一个活改为把七个活，大大降低了辅助时间。在一台机床上干活的丁惠庆、邢其耕以及在一台机床上干活的周玉汉和姜晋池等，都通过改进工具，分别把生产效率提高四倍到七倍。车工郭修田自开展
  “千台时”运动以来，由于加大吃刀量和机床转数，每天平均完成三十小时工作量。为了实现“千台时”指标，出现了前所未有的共产主义大协作。同时，三班工人之间根据技术水平，也合理地调整了劳动组织。
