Poland's Seven-Year Plan for Developing the National Economy
Tao Zhong

In October of last year, the 12th Central Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party approved the guidelines for the development of the Polish People's Republic for 1959-1965, and decided to discuss them at the Third Party Congress to be held on March 10 this year. Over the past few months, in conjunction with welcoming the "Third Congress" and electing representatives to the "Third Congress," enthusiastic discussions on this plan have been carried out throughout Poland, setting off a new wave of enthusiasm for building socialism among the broad masses of working people.

Just as an economic crisis is enveloping the capitalist world and imperialism is heading towards disintegration, the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is unprecedentedly united and is stepping up the building of communism and socialism at a rapid pace. Mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries are also becoming increasingly close, causing the competition for the total output value of the entire socialist camp to exceed that of the capitalist world to unfold in socialist countries, marking a new stage in the competition between the two systems. Poland's Seven-Year Plan for Developing the National Economy was formulated under these circumstances.

The goal of Poland's Seven-Year Plan is to continue the country's socialist industrialization, expand productive forces to improve the people's living standards, and shorten the distance between Poland and the economically highly developed European countries. The targets set by the plan and the fifteen-year long-term plan both indicate that by 1965, Poland's output of major industrial products per capita will exceed the current level of Italy, catch up with or exceed the current level of France, and at the same time greatly shorten the distance between Poland and Britain and West Germany. After 1965, even more ambitious tasks will be proposed. Its realization is an important part of the competition between socialism and capitalism.

Poland's Seven-Year Plan includes the last two years of the first five-year plan (1956-1960) and the second five-year plan. The formulation of this plan is based on the current level of economic development in Poland. Before the war, Poland was a backward and poor agricultural country, and suffered serious damage during the Second World War. However, in the short fourteen years of the people's government, Poland has changed its backward face and built a strong industrial foundation, and is now a strong industrial country in Europe. According to 1957 statistics, the average per capita output of several major industrial products, such as steel, coal, electricity, sulfuric acid, cement, cotton yarn, and rayon, has exceeded the average world level. The average output value per hundred hectares of land has increased by 45% compared with before the war. National industrialization has increased the number of employees outside of agriculture from 4.2 million before the war to 7.2 million. The living standards of the working people have greatly improved, and the consumption of food and textiles has increased significantly compared with before the war. In terms of culture and education, universal education has been achieved, the number of middle school graduates has doubled compared with before the war, the number of university students has tripled, and the number of engineering and technical personnel has increased by 3.5 times.

The high-speed development of industry will make Poland's industrial level in 1965 equal to ten times that of before the war. At that time, coal production (including hard coal and lignite) will reach 111.5 million tons, an average of about 3,770 kilograms per person, while before the war it was only 1,054 kilograms per person; electricity will be 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an average of 1,285 kilowatt-hours per person, while before the war it was only 106 kilowatt-hours per person; steel will be 8.8 million tons, an average of 273 kilograms per person, while before the war it was only 43 kilograms per person; sulfuric acid will be 1.06 million tons, an average of 32.8 kilograms per person, while before the war it was only 5.3 kilograms per person; cement will be 10 million tons, an average of about 309 kilograms per person, while before the war it was 37.5 kilograms per person; rayon will be 116,000 tons, an average of 3.84 kilograms per person, while before the war it was only 0.31 kilograms per person. Judging from the growth targets of the above-mentioned major products, after the second five-year plan, that is, by 1965, Poland's industrial production level will approach or exceed the current industrial production level of developed capitalist countries in Europe.

It can be seen from the plan that the formulation of the second five-year plan has absorbed the experience of Poland's fourteen years of construction and paid attention to the balanced development of various sectors of the national economy. Appropriate proportions have been made in the plan for the balance between heavy industry and light industry, between power, building materials industry and other industries, and between mechanical processing, casting and forging, electrical appliances, and bearings within the machinery industry. For example, the output value of the food industry will increase by at least 30% in five years, and the textile industry will increase by about 20% to 30% to adapt to the development of agriculture and the needs of the people. Electricity will increase by 47.7% and cement will increase by 50% to meet the requirement that the entire industry grows by 50%. In addition, it is necessary to expand foundries and forging plants and heat treatment workshops, and expand the production of bearings, electrical appliances, cables, etc. to adapt to the development of the machinery industry.

In order to ensure the balanced development of the raw material industry and the processing industry and the full utilization of domestic resources, the plan stipulates that the domestic raw material base must be expanded to the greatest extent, geological exploration work must be stepped up, especially the search for oil and natural gas, and the development of domestic sulfur, copper mines, and coking coal. The plan also stipulates that the mining of lignite should be expanded, and the smelting industry of iron and steel and non-ferrous metals should be expanded; the variety of steel products should be expanded, and the output of high-quality steel should be increased; at the same time, the abundant coal, sulfur, rock salt and other resources should be used to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, especially rayon, synthetic rubber, artificial substances, fertilizers and petroleum products. By the end of 1965, the annual output of rayon will reach 116,000 tons (approximately equal to the current amount of cotton imported by Poland each year), synthetic rubber will be 50,000 tons (exceeding the current annual import of rubber), fertilizer will be 840,000 tons, and artificial substances will be 140,000 tons.

In addition, in order to develop domestic industry and expand exports to exchange for the light and heavy industrial raw materials that Poland lacks, such as cotton, rubber, petroleum, and rare metals, the plan stipulates that emphasis should be placed on the development of the machinery industry (such as shipbuilding, railway vehicles, complete sets of equipment, etc.), so that its output value will increase by 70% in five years.

The speed of agricultural production in 1965 should be 20% higher than in 1960 (30% higher than in 1958). The increase in agricultural production mainly relies on increasing the yield per unit area, and it is necessary to increase the number of cattle and pigs to increase the production of meat and milk. The yield of grain per hectare will increase from 14.8 quintals in 1958 to 17.5 quintals in 1965; potatoes from 126 quintals to 160 quintals; sugar beets will reach 236 quintals; cattle will increase from 8.2 million heads to 10.5 million to 11.5 million heads; pigs will increase from 12 million heads to 16 million to 15 million heads; milk will increase from 11.35 billion liters to 15.4 billion liters. To this end, agricultural investment will increase by 44.5% compared with the first five-year plan, and will account for about 13% of the total investment. The plan stipulates that the area of soil improvement should be expanded, the supply of artificial fertilizers, agricultural machinery and tractors should be increased, and farmers' agricultural knowledge should be improved.

In addition to fully utilizing the production potential of individual farmers to increase agricultural production, socialist transformation of the countryside will continue to be implemented during the second five-year plan period, and the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives will be strengthened. At the same time, state-owned farms should improve their management and greatly increase production, so as to play a significant role in supplying the country with food and raw materials. Agricultural indicators are lower than industrial indicators, but it is possible to overfulfill them through the efforts of the Polish people.

The plan not only made detailed provisions for the development of production, but also made appropriate arrangements for the improvement of the people's material and cultural life on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production. In 1965, the actual wages of employees will increase by 23% to 25% compared with 1960, and by 33% to 35% compared with 1958. The actual income of farmers will also have a similar increase. In order to meet the increase in people's consumption, under the condition that the total investment increases by 46%, the investment in the consumer goods industry will increase by more than 50%. Increase the production of fiber, leather, and food industries, and use some industrial equipment to increase the production of various durable goods. In 1965, the average meat output per person will be 58 kilograms. The average sugar per person is 46.4 kilograms. Cotton fabrics average 24 meters per person, woolen fabrics average about 3 meters per person, silk fabrics average about 4.5 meters per person, and leather shoes average 1.6 pairs per person. In addition, washing machines, refrigerators, radios, televisions, sewing machines, etc. have appropriate growth. Two million houses will be built in cities and 1.2 million houses will be built in rural areas in five years to improve living conditions. In addition, cultural and educational undertakings, public utilities, and improvement of health and medical conditions, and development of sports will be developed accordingly.

At present, the nationwide discussion on Poland's seven-year plan for developing the national economy has come to an end. Local organs, industrial and mining enterprises and other units have put forward many suggestions on the plan. The most obvious of these is that the output of steel has increased from 8.8 million tons to 9 million tons, electricity has increased from 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours to 43 billion kilowatt-hours, and there are more such suggestions in the machinery manufacturing industry, and other departments have similar situations. We believe that the Polish people under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party will surely achieve even more brilliant victories in realizing their seven-year plan for developing the national economy.

    波兰发展国民经济的七年计划
    涛中
    去年10月，波兰统一工人党第十二次中央全会批准了1959—1965年波兰人民共和国发展的指示，并决定在今年3月10日召开的第三次党代表大会上进行讨论。几个月来，波兰全国各地结合着迎接“三大”和选举“三大”代表，对这个计划进行了热烈的讨论，在广大劳动人民群众中掀起了建设社会主义的新的热潮。
    正当经济危机笼罩着资本主义世界，帝国主义走向四分五裂的时候，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前团结，并正以跃进的速度加紧共产主义和社会主义建设，社会主义各国间的互助合作也日益紧密，使整个社会主义阵营的总产值超过资本主义世界的竞赛正在社会主义各国展开，它标志着两种体系的竞赛已进入新的阶段。波兰发展国民经济的七年计划就是在这种形势下制定的。
    波兰七年计划的目标是继续进行国家社会主义工业化，扩大生产力以提高人民生活水平，缩短波兰与经济高度发展的欧洲国家间的距离。计划规定的指标和十五年的远景规划都表明，到1965年时，波兰的主要工业品产量按人口平均将超过目前意大利的水平，赶上或超过法国目前的水平，同时将大大缩短波兰和英国及西德间的距离。1965年后还将提出更为宏伟的任务。它的实现是社会主义和资本主义进行竞赛的一个重要组成部分。
    波兰七年计划包括第一个五年计划（1956—1960年）的后两年和第二个五年计划，这个计划的制订是以波兰现阶段经济发展的水平为基础的。战前波兰是个落后和贫困的农业国，在第二次世界大战中又遭到了严重的破坏，但在人民政权的短短十四年中，波兰改变了落后的面貌，建设了强大的工业化基础，目前已成为欧洲的工业强国。根据1957年的统计，几种主要工业产品如钢、煤、电力、硫酸、水泥、棉纱、人造纤维等，按人口平均计算已超过平均的世界水平。一百公顷土地的平均产值比战前增加了45％。国家工业化使除农业外的职工人数从战前的四百二十万增加到七百二十万。劳动人民的生活水平有了很大的提高，食品和纺织品的消耗量比战前有了显著的增长。在文化教育方面，普及教育已经实现，中学毕业生比战前增加一倍；大学生增加二倍；工程技术人员增加三点五倍。
    工业高速度的发展，将使1965年时波兰工业水平等于战前的十倍。那时煤炭产量（包括石煤和褐煤）将达到一亿一千一百五十万吨，按人口平均每人约三千七百七十公斤，而战前每人只有一千零五十四公斤；电力四百一十五亿度，平均每人一千二百八十五度，战前每人只有一百零六度；钢八百八十万吨，平均每人二百七十三公斤，战前每人只有四十三公斤。硫酸一百零六万吨，平均每人三十二点八公斤，战前每人只有五点三公斤；水泥一千万吨，平均每人约三百零九公斤，战前每人三十七点五公斤；人造纤维十一点六万吨，平均每人三点八四公斤，战前每人只有零点三一公斤。按以上几种主要产品的增长指标看，经过第二个五年计划，也就是说到1965年，波兰工业的生产水平将接近或超过欧洲发达资本主义国家目前的工业生产水平。
    从计划中可以看出，第二个五年计划的制定已吸取了波兰十四年建设的经验，注意到国民经济各部门的平衡发展。对重工业和轻工业之间，动力、建筑材料业与其他工业之间，机械工业内部的机械加工，铸造锻造、电器、轴承等之间的平衡，在计划中都做了适当的比例。例如，食品工业的产值在五年内至少要增加30％，纺织业约增20％到30％，以适应农业的发展和人民的需要。电力将增长47.7％，水泥增长50％，以适应整个工业增长50％的要求。另外要扩建铸造厂和锻造厂及热处理车间，扩大轴承、电器、电缆等的生产，以适应机械工业的发展。
    为了使原料工业和加工工业平衡的发展和充分利用本国资源，计划中规定必须最大限度地扩大本国原料基础，必须加紧地质勘探工作，特别要找寻石油和天然煤气，开发本国硫磺、铜矿、炼焦煤。计划中还规定要扩大褐煤的开采，扩建钢铁业及有色金属的冶炼业；扩大钢材品种，增加优质钢；同时利用本国丰富的煤、硫磺、石盐等资源加速发展化学工业，特别是人造纤维、人造橡胶、人造物质、肥料及石油制品等。到1965年年底时，人造纤维的年产量将达到十一点六万吨（约等于目前波兰每年进口棉花的数量），合成橡胶五万吨，（超过目前每年进口橡胶量），肥料八十四万吨，人造物质十四万吨。
    此外，为了发展本国工业和扩大出口以换取本国所缺乏的轻重工业原料，如棉花、橡胶、石油、稀有金属等，计划规定要着重发展机器工业（如造船、铁道车辆、成套设备等），使其产值在五年中增长70％。
    农业生产的速度在1965年要比1960年增长20％（比1958年增长30％）。农业增产主要依靠增加单位面积产量，并要增加牛和猪的头数，以提高肉和牛奶的产量。谷物的每一公顷产量将由1958年的十四点八公担增到1965年的十七点五公担；土豆由一百二十六公担增到一百六十公担；甜菜达到二百三十六公担；牛由八百二十万头增到一千零五十到一千一百五十万头；猪由一千二百万头增到一千六百到一千五百万头；牛奶由一百一十三点五亿公升增到一百五十四亿公升。为此农业投资将比第一个五年计划增加44.5％，并约占投资总额的13％。计划规定要扩大土壤改良的面积，增加人造肥料、农业机械和拖拉机的供应，并提高农民的农业知识。
    除了充分利用个体农民的生产潜力以增加农业生产外，在第二个五年计划期间将继续实行农村的社会主义改造，加强发展农业生产合作社。同时国营农场要改善经营，大大提高生产，以便在供应国家食品和原料中起显著作用。农业指标比工业指标要低一些，但是经过波兰人民的努力是可能超额完成的。
    计划中不仅对发展生产做了详尽的规定，同时在工农业生产发展的基础上对人民物质生活和文化生活的提高也作了适当的安排。1965年职工的实际工资比1960年增加23％到25％，比1958年增加33％到35％。农民的实际收入也有类似的增长。为了满足人民消费量的增长，在总投资额增加46％的情况下，将消费资料工业的投资增加50％以上。增加纤维、皮革、食品工业的生产，并利用部分工业设备，增加各种耐用品的生产。1965年肉类产量每人平均五十八公斤。糖每人平均四十六点四公斤。棉织品每人平均二十四公尺、毛织品每人约三公尺，丝织品每人平均约四点五公尺，皮鞋每人平均一点六双。另外洗衣机、冰箱、收音机、电视机、缝纫机等都有适当的增长。五年中城市建造住房二百万间，农村一百二十万间，以改善居住条件。此外，还将相应地发展文教事业，公用事业，改善保健和医疗条件，发展体育等。
    目前波兰全国对发展国民经济七年计划的全民性讨论已告一段落。各地机关工矿企业等单位都对计划提出了许多建议，其中最明显的是钢的产量从八百八十万吨增到九百万吨，电力从四百一十五亿度增到四百三十亿度，机器制造业中这种建议更多，其他部门也有类似的情况。我们相信，在波兰统一工人党领导下的波兰人民，在实现自己发展国民经济的七年计划中一定会取得更辉煌的胜利。
