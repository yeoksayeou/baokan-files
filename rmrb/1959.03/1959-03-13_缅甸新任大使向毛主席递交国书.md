Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 12th: Brigadier General Maung Maung Gyawun, the newly appointed Ambassador of the Union of Burma to China, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong today, accompanied by diplomatic officials from the embassy.

Present at the ceremony were: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and Director of the Protocol Department Yu Peiwen.

In his address during the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Maung Maung Gyawun said: "Between our two countries, especially in the past decade, close and good-neighborly relations have been fortunately developed thanks to the efforts of the leaders of our two countries. This relationship is built on a solid foundation, which is the common faith of the people of the two countries in the principles of peaceful coexistence and their common dedication to the cause of maintaining world peace and promoting mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation between countries. I will continue to make efforts to strengthen the good-neighborly relations and mutual understanding between our two countries and promote our common interests."

Chairman Mao Zedong replied: "China and Burma have been close neighbors since ancient times. In the long struggle against colonialism and for national independence, the people of the two countries have forged a deep friendship. Since both countries have successively freed themselves from colonial oppression, the friendship established by the people of the two countries on a new basis has been continuously developing. I firmly believe that, with the firm maintenance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by both China and Burma, the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of China and Burma will be further consolidated and strengthened in the future, thereby making greater contributions to peace in Asia and the world."

    缅甸新任大使向毛主席递交国书
    新华社武汉12日电　缅甸联邦新任驻华大使貌貌觉温准将，今天偕大使馆外交官员，向毛泽东主席递交国书。
    在场的有：外交部副部长姬鹏飞，礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    貌貌觉温大使在递交国书时致颂词说：“在我们两国之间，特别是在过去十年中，由于我们两国领导人的努力，幸运地发展了亲密的睦邻关系。这种关系建立在牢固的基础上，这就是两国人民对于和平共处的原则抱着共同信仰，并且共同献身于维护世界和平和促进各国之间互利的友好合作关系的事业。我将不断地进行努力来密切我们两国之间的睦邻关系和相互了解，并且促进我们的共同利益。”
    毛泽东主席致答词说：“中缅两国自古以来就是亲密的邻邦。在共同反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的长期斗争中，两国人民更结下了深厚的友谊。自从两国各自先后摆脱了殖民主义压迫以来，两国人民在新的基础上所建立起来的友谊有了不断的发展。我深信，在中缅双方坚决维护和平共处五项原则的情况下，中缅两国人民之间的友好合作关系今后必将得到进一步的巩固和加强，从而对亚洲和世界和平作出更大的贡献。”
