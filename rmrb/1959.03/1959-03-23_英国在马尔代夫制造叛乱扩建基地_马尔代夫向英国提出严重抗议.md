　　British Instigates Rebellion in Maldives to Expand Base
　　Maldives Lodges Strong Protest with Britain

　　(Comprehensive dispatch from our newspaper) Recently, Britain stirred up an anti-government rebellion in the island nation of Maldives in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, using the pretext of "protecting Commonwealth countries," it proposed expanding its military base. This British action infringed upon the independence and sovereignty of Maldives and threatened the peace and security of related countries in the region. The Maldives government has lodged a strong protest, and public opinion in various countries has unanimously expressed condemnation.

　　The Maldives government representative in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) issued a press release on the 20th, stating that because the British government deliberately interfered directly in the internal affairs of Maldives by instigating rebellion, the Maldives government had to suspend negotiations with the British government in Colombo. The press release stated that during the negotiations, the British government, through its so-called liaison officer Major Phillips on Gan Island, incited discontent among the people of Gan Island and two neighboring islands. The press release said that the purpose of this action was to coerce the Maldives government into agreeing to hand over the base under humiliating and extremely unfair conditions. After discussing the historical background of the current dispute, the press release stated that it was clear that during the recent negotiations in Colombo, the British government intended to treat the Maldives as its dominion. The press release said that during the period of so-called British "protection," the Maldives was in a state of misfortune and neglect, and it was brutally deprived of all social, cultural, and economic benefits. The press release said: "During the past seventy-two years of dealing with the Maldives, the British government has hindered any progress in all aspects of the Maldives." The press release concluded by stating that if the British government stops creating chaos in the Maldives, the Maldives is prepared to resume negotiations. It also called on all those who believe in the rights of small countries and the rule of law to sympathize with the Maldives, which is urgently facing the problem of breaking free from the control of great powers.

　　According to existing information from the Maldives government office in Colombo, the newly formed "nation" of rebels is named the Suvadive Islands, but the rebellion is still limited to Adu Atoll, which has a population of about five thousand. The rebel leaders and the British authorities on Gan Island continue to maintain contact and are receiving supplies from them.

　　This tension created by Britain in the Indian Ocean has aroused the concern of the Indian government. Prime Minister Nehru said in the People's Assembly on the 17th, when talking about the British garrison in Maldives, "We are against the policy of establishing such bases everywhere. The will of the people of the countries concerned must ultimately decide everything, and nothing should be imposed on them." He completely denied that the British establishment of a base in Maldives was to protect India. He said: "We don't want any such protection."

    英国在马尔代夫制造叛乱扩建基地
    马尔代夫向英国提出严重抗议
    本报综合报道　英国最近在印度洋上的岛国——马尔代夫煽起了反对政府的叛乱，同时又借口“保护英联邦国家”提出了扩建军事基地的要求；英国这一行动侵犯了马尔代夫的独立和主权，而且威胁了这一地区有关国家的和平和安全；马尔代夫政府已提出严重抗议，各国舆论也一致表示谴责。
    马尔代夫政府驻锡兰代表20日发表新闻公报说，由于英国政府煽动叛乱蓄意直接干涉马尔代夫的内政，马尔代夫政府不得不中止同英国政府在科伦坡举行的谈判。公报说，在谈判期间，英国政府通过它在甘岛的所谓联络官菲利普斯少校在甘岛和邻近两个岛屿的人民中煽动不满情绪。公报说，这种行动的目的是要胁迫马尔代夫政府在屈辱和非常不公平的条件下同意交出基地。公报在谈到目前争端的历史背景以后说，很明显，最近在科伦坡谈判期间，英国政府打算把马尔代夫当作它的属地看待。公报说，在所谓英国人“保护”期间，马尔代夫是处在不幸和受人忽视的状态，它被粗暴地剥夺了一切社会、文化和经济利益。公报说：“英国政府在过去七十二年同马尔代夫打交道的期间，阻挠了马尔代夫在各方面的任何进步。”公报最后表示，如果英国政府停止在马尔代夫制造混乱，马尔代夫准备恢复谈判。它还呼吁一切相信小国的权利和法律统治的人同情马尔代夫，它正迫切地面临着要摆脱大国的控制的问题。
    据马尔代夫政府驻科伦坡办事处现有的情报表明，叛乱分子新组成的“国家”以苏瓦迪夫群岛为名，但叛乱仍限于大约有五千居民的阿杜岛上。叛乱领袖和甘岛的英国当局继续保持接触，并正在从他们那里得到给养。
    英国在印度洋中制造的这一紧张局势引起了印度官方的关怀。尼赫鲁总理17日在人民院谈到英国驻军马尔代夫时说，“我们反对到处建立这种基地的政策。有关国家人民的意愿必须最后决定一切，任何东西都不应当强加在它们身上。”他完全否认英国在马尔代夫建立基地是保护印度。他说：“我们不要任何这样的保护。”
