Double Leap Forward in Production and Infrastructure
Li Yiqing
General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company

    At the beginning of this year, all employees of our company, in order to speed up project construction and overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment, extensively carried out mass technical revolution movements and, in the spirit of self-reliance, established some simple, indigenous, and combined factories to manufacture materials, tools, and simple equipment. All employees of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company enthusiastically responded to the call of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, and extensively launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. Various companies, factories, mines, and even construction sites put forward their own targets and measures to ensure that the blast furnaces, coke ovens, and mines that have already been put into production are truly high-yielding and high-quality; to ensure that the blast furnace, sintering plant, and open hearth furnace projects that are under construction and will be constructed can be accelerated and completed ahead of schedule. Because the workers have liberated their minds and vigorously carried out technical revolutions, they have already made many outstanding achievements. For example, the concrete pouring for the hot blast stove foundation of the blast furnace under construction was shortened from the original plan of forty-eight hours to twenty-nine hours; the concrete project for the blast furnace body foundation was also poured in only sixteen hours, which was eleven hours shorter than in the past. These facts all show that under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for construction, the workers' enthusiasm is becoming more and more sufficient, the methods are becoming more and more numerous, and the effects are becoming greater and greater.
    We must try every means to further improve the daily output level of the blast furnaces and coke ovens that have already been put into production in the shortest possible time. In terms of capital construction, we must concentrate a certain amount of strength to make a concentrated effort on the construction of the sintering plant and strive to complete it and put it into production in the shortest possible time; secondly, the blast furnace, open hearth furnace, coke oven, and refractory material plant that are under construction this year must all be put into production on schedule and strive to be put into production ahead of schedule. The primary rolling mill and large-scale rolling mill should also strive to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year; at the same time, we must vigorously grasp transportation and rapidly carry out the construction of the industrial port.
    Our measures are:
    First, resolutely implement the policy of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game and walking on two legs. According to the requirements of the national plan, make comprehensive arrangements for the company's production and infrastructure, implement large-scale cooperation between infrastructure and production, and jointly strive to complete the national plan. Implement the policy of giving priority to large-scale projects, combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, combining self-reliance with striving for foreign aid, and giving priority to foreign methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods; in the mechanical and power systems and all processing plants, thoroughly implement the policy of giving priority to maintenance and repair, combining maintenance with equipment manufacturing, and thoroughly overcome the one-sidedness in guiding ideology.
    Second, continue to extensively and deeply carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy with technical revolution as the center. On the production front, the first battle is to further mobilize the masses with ensuring high blast furnace yield as the center, adopt technical measures that combine indigenous and foreign methods, to improve coke quality and produce more and better ore, improve blast furnace operation, and ensure normal production. At the same time, it is necessary to check and make a concentrated effort to carry out finishing projects to create better conditions for improving production. On the capital construction front, improve construction tools, improve operation methods, and improve labor organization through technical revolution; earnestly study, summarize, and promote advanced experience; rationally queue up the engineering projects and appropriately shorten the battle line, so as to concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles. Secondly, we must vigorously organize rapid construction. At the same time, we must also take various measures to open up material sources and eliminate material waste. Vigorously cultivate technical forces, continue to carry out the all-rounder movement, organize mixed work teams, rationally arrange

    生产基建双跃进
    武汉钢铁公司总经理　李一清
    今年一开始，我们公司的全体职工，为了加快工程建设，克服原材料、设备不足的困难，广泛地开展了群众性的技术革命运动，并且本着自力更生的精神，举办了一些简易的、土洋结合的制造材料、工具和简易设备的工厂。武汉钢铁公司的全体职工，热烈地响应了湖北省委和武汉市委的号召，广泛地掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。各公司、厂、矿乃至工地都纷纷提出了自己的指标和措施，保证已经投入生产的高炉、焦炉和矿山等都切实做到高产优质；保证正在和即将施工的高炉、烧结厂和平炉等项工程，都能加速和提前施工。职工们由于解放了思想，大搞技术革命，已经作出了很多出色的成绩。例如正在建设的高炉的热风炉基础混凝土浇灌，由原计划的四十八小时，缩短为二十九小时；高炉本体基础混凝土工程也只花了十六小时就浇灌完毕，比过去缩短了十一小时，这些事实，都说明了在党的领导下，在党的建设总路线的光辉照耀下，职工们的干劲越鼓越足，办法越想越多，效果越来越大。
    我们要想尽一切办法，在最短的时间内把已经投入生产的高炉和焦炉的日产水平，进一步提高。在基本建设方面，要集中一定的力量，突击烧结厂的建设，力争在最短期间内建成投入生产；其次今年正在建设的高炉、平炉、焦炉、耐火材料厂，一定都按期并力争提前投入生产，初轧厂、大型轧钢厂也力争在今年第四季度建成；同时，要大力抓运输，迅速进行工业港的建设。
    我们的措施是：
    第一、坚决贯彻全国一盘棋和两条腿走路的方针。根据国家计划的要求，把公司的生产、基建做全面的安排，实行基建、生产大协作，共同为完成国家计划而奋斗。贯彻执行以大为主、大中小相结合，自力更生与争取外援相结合，以洋为主、土洋结合的方针；在机械动力系统及一切加工厂中，贯彻执行以维护检修为主、维修和制造设备相结合的方针彻底克服指导思想上的片面性。
    第二、继续广泛深入地开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。在生产战线上，第一个战役是：以确保高炉丰产为中心进一步发动群众，采取土洋结合的技术措施，以提高焦炭质量和多产矿、产好矿，改进高炉操作，保证正常生产。同时，要检查和突击进行收尾工程，为提高生产创造更好的条件。在基本建设战线上，通过技术革命，改良施工工具，改进操作方法，改善劳动组织；认真学习、总结和推广先进经验；将工程项目进行合理的排队，适当地缩短战线，以便集中优势兵力，打歼灭战。其次，要大力组织快速施工。同时还要采取各种措施，开辟材料来源和消灭材料浪费现象。大力培养技术力量，继续开展多面手运动，组织混合工作队，合理安排和使用劳动力，提高劳动效率。
    第三、加强党的领导，进一步贯彻群众路线，继续贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制，和党委领导下的职工代表大会制，实行“两参一改三结合”。继续转变干部作风，组织干部参加劳动，密切干部和群众的关系，关心群众生活、改进企业管理。更广泛深入地发动群众，使干劲越鼓越高，工作越作越细，运动越搞越深。一环扣一环，一浪推一浪，一个战役接一个战役地不断前进！
