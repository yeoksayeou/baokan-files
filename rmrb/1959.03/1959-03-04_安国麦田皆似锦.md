An Guo's Wheat Fields are All Like Brocade
By our special correspondent, Kang Tuo

It is right around "Jingzhe" (惊蛰, Awakening of Insects) season. The spring is warm, flowers are blooming, and the land is green. Lightning and thunder awaken all things. In An Guo, Hebei, the charming spring scenery and stirring spring thunder, this year, have not been able to fulfill their responsibility of first awakening all things. The color of the 350,000 mu of wheat fields there has already surpassed the spring scenery, inspiring the mountains and rivers to cheer and attracting a constant stream of visitors.

	Farmland Arranged Like Sculpture
In the agricultural production slogan proposed at the wheat bumper harvest mobilization meeting held in An Guo by the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee, there were two sentences saying: "Farmland arrangement like sculpture, crop cultivation like brocade flowers." This is a call to combine hard work with science, and it is also a realistic portrayal of An Guo and many other regions across the country. Just speaking of the large-scale high-yield wheat square fields outside the meeting place where the call was issued, they were truly sculpted, truly brocade, a gold-embroidered picture that puts embroiderers and weaving girls to shame.

The most astonishing thing is undoubtedly the square formation of high-yield wheat in the Wurenqiao Dongfeng People's Commune. The 1,018 mu of land, called "the number one field in the world" by the commune members, was originally a "silt crack" on the bank of the returning Ci River. The soil quality was not bad, but it was "soft in the morning, hard in the morning, and impossible to dig in the afternoon." There were sixteen water-filled pits, and countless large and small paths. It had been a low-yielding area for years, and the county committee often asked local cadres and the masses what to do with that piece of land. The Great Leap Forward naturally had a solution. After communization, people thought of the "satellite" field in Zhuotou Village, which had a yield of 5,103 jin per mu, and the soil quality was not even as good as theirs; could it be that a "rocket" could not be launched here? Once the decision was made, work began in September of last year. The county party secretary participated personally. The commune party committee set up a shed there, working day and night without leaving the land. A professional team of two hundred people, a temporary shock team of three thousand people. Harvesting autumn crops, clearing land, filling soil... in the blink of an eye, the land was greatly leveled, so much so that you might even describe it as "furrows in a straight line, the ground as flat as a mirror." Looking around, one sees an endless expanse. Some people said that facing that thousand-mu field, one really doubted how the earth could be round. It was completely a square ocean, especially the hundreds of mu enclosed by sorghum stalk fences, which were cut as neatly as with a knife. Each plot was three zhang long and one zhang wide, exactly five li of land. The ridges and furrows, no matter how you looked at them horizontally or vertically, all extended straight to the distant horizon. The newly green wheat seedlings in front of you, densely packed and green, with each ridge and row also holding hands, forming a straight line to the horizon. The main roads in the entire square field, seven north-south and five east-west, needless to say, were straight as arrows, intersecting at right angles. The slopes on both sides of the ridges and furrows were smooth and flat, finely crafted and precisely carved, truly ingenious. Originally, the quality prescribed by the entire commune was six straights and four flats: ground flat, plot bottom flat, furrow flat, field road flat; land edge straight, land head straight, furrow straight, plot back straight, wheat row straight, plot top wave straight. Think about it: if this isn't sculpture, isn't brocade, what is it!

	"Treating Wheat Like Parents"
The scene before your eyes may only be the so-called superficial aspect of advanced gardening. Through the appearance, all the land has been deeply plowed to a depth of one and a half feet. All of it is layered soil and layered fertilizer, with corn stalks laid at the bottom. Land preparation and harrowing were done seven times. After the land was prepared, sowing wheat was also done three times evenly: fertilizer evenly, seeds evenly, watering evenly. Forty rubber-wheeled carts hauled chemical fertilizer, spreading it while pulling, a grand sight. After sowing, at least sixty jin of seeds per mu were used, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense and silent. Initially, every foot of sowing had to be dug open to check, and more than a dozen experienced veteran farmers were first found to conduct trial sowing. Liu Xiaosan sowed once, leaving two liang of seeds; Liu Lao Pang learned his lesson, but sowed two liang more. So this group of "old experts" would sow for a while, sit down and study for half a day, then sow again, then study again... finally, they were able to train others to achieve about twenty-five grains per foot in a single row. After checking by students from Hebei Agricultural University, the difference was no more than two or three grains! Despite this, later, when the commune inserted signs with "Technical Expert So-and-So Sowing" next to the fields plowed by the old farmers, Yan Lao Ying Lao Han wouldn't let them insert one for him; he said:
	"I can't do it! I'm not sure if what I sowed will grow well!"

Needless to say, the wheat seedlings are growing very well now. The main roots are thick and strong, with roots reaching six feet long in areas plowed seven feet deep, and four feet and a few inches long in areas plowed five feet deep; and there are an average of three tillers per plant, reaching about two million plants per mu. But the old farmers are still cautious and modest. I asked Liu Lao Shi if the wheat in that area could yield 10,000 jin per mu. This optimistic and humorous old man pretended and shouted, "It can't be done!" But when the neighboring Song Lao Biao mentioned that a lot of wheat seeds were planted, Lao Shi immediately said, "There are many seeds, but the land is also plowed deeply, and a lot of fertilizer is also applied!" Lao Biao followed up and said, "That's right! Corn and sorghum yielded 20,000 to 30,000 jin last year! People used to say that young people are careless, but now you can't stop them from staying in the fields all day, cultivating the seedlings one by one, spraying this one and watering that one!" Lao Shi concluded by saying, "That's right! Can you say that we can't yield 10,000 jin? It's just that we old folks haven't seen it before!"

The old farmers' observations are meticulous. The fact is indeed "cultivating the seedlings one by one." Li Guichun, the instructor of the thousand-mu field professional team in Wurenqiao, told me that some people in their team are determined to "treat wheat like parents," while others say, "Treat wheat like yourself, just like lighting a fire when the house is cold, wearing a hat when the head is cold, and wearing cotton shoes when the feet are cold!" Therefore, when checking the quality of the thousand-mu field during deep plowing, each piece of land had to be checked in three places; after sowing and checking for missing seedlings, a five-inch gap was called a missing seedling, and a one-foot gap was called a broken row, and naturally they all had to be filled in. Watering was initially done with a pot-camel machine on the bank of the Ci River, but now it is all covered by four-eyed machine wells; naturally, it is all small water and slow flow, guaranteeing that the seedlings drink their fill. Moreover, when changing the plot for watering, they never habitually shovel soil nearby to block the old plot mouth, but instead have a special person transport sand to pad it, so as to avoid shoveling the ground into pits and preventing water from silting up the wheat seedlings and washing away the furrows, and maintaining the firmness and straightness of the ridges. After watering the first time last winter, another thirty jin of field fertilizer powder was applied per mu. Soil loosening was done with specially made iron wire rakes. In order to pick up the small clods in the field, people even knelt on the ridges, bent down, and stretched out their light fingers, as if they were stretching out carving knives and embroidery needles.

Throughout the winter, it was truly knife by knife, stitch by stitch, experiencing three victorious battles during the seedling protection, tillering, and overwintering periods of fine harrowing, covering fertilizer, and covering sand to ensure safety. There were two applications of fertilizer and two waterings, and the green fertilizer was also 20,000 jin per mu. After Lichun (立春, Beginning of Spring), they also re-rolled, lightly rolled, shallowly harrowed, and finely harrowed according to the growth of the seedlings; I personally saw the professional team members rolling each plot solid, pulling out the withered leaves, taking small steps to quickly flatten the soil, without hurting a single leaf or missing a single plant. Some team members did not even leave the front line during the Spring Festival, breaking up the coarse fertilizer and spreading it finely to fill the cracks in the wheat fields to prevent cold wind. Now, with fertilizer as the commander, and preparing to water during "Jingzhe," they aim to apply ten fertilizers and ten waterings here. The Wurenqiao Chemical Fertilizer Plant produces 60,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer daily, and the thousand-mu field has accumulated more than 2 million jin of manure and 150,000 jin of sheep manure; moreover, there is a pit every five mu and a tank every three mu. Outside the sorghum stalk fence around the square field, there is a row of man-made urine tanks buried underground, surrounded by dense grass mats, with finely woven grass covers on top. In addition, the observer's soil thermometer and the meteorological station at the head of the field constantly transmit messages to the professional team, just like sending creative inspiration and themes to embroiderers and engravers.

	Competing for "Marshal Fields"
Naturally, An Guo's sculpted and brocade-like wheat fields are not limited to Wurenqiao alone. The county and commune party secretaries alone have contracted twenty-two high-yield squares requiring a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. The enthusiasm of the county's 400,000 people shakes the Milky Way, and their ambitions startle the universe. "Number One Field," "Number One Peak," "Top Scholar Square," and also "Marshal Field," "Sun Field," each square competes for exquisiteness. The county party committee collectively calls them "Marshal Fields." This year, the county guarantees a wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu, striving for 5,000 jin, far exceeding the "one season equals one year" slogan proposed at the provincial party committee's wheat high-yield symposium some time ago. Constantly revolutionizing An Guo, in previous years, there was no saddle shape, and last year, they created the experience of "eight revolutionary months, sixteen fighting segments," from the eight months starting in February, from "Yushui" (雨水, Rain Water) to "Hanlu" (寒露, Cold Dew), month after month, segment after segment, stroke by stroke, and with great momentum; this year's wheat field originally set out six key management points of grasping plants, grasping ears, grasping grains, and preventing disease, preventing insects, and preventing lodging, and prepared five climaxes from "Jingzhe" to "Xiaoman" (小满, Lesser Fullness of Grain), truly meticulous and subtle measures and also a surging movement. And it's not just wheat fields, the 10,000-mu cotton field square that the Wurenqiao Commune has already prepared is also constantly visited by a stream of people; and the county party committee is also preparing to create an even larger cotton field square in the northern part of the county, "north-south like a belt, east-west like a sea."

In An Guo, what I see is truly endlessly inspiring. Li Zao Tong, one of the creators of the 5,103 jin per mu wheat yield in Zhuotou Village last year, now cultivates a wheat field with one main root that has forty-eight tillers, and he has also conducted experiments in greenhouses on grafting wheat with corn, grafting intercropped grass, and grafting wild wheat, etc. Zhongsong, the poorest village with the most farm laborers in the past, handed over 47,000 jin of public grain the year before last, but had to provide 30,000 jin of relief and buy back 30,000 jin in the autumn to have enough to eat; last year, they requisitioned a total of 120,000 jin of grain, and now they are living a rich and surplus life. Xing Lao Duo, an eighty-one-year-old in the nursing home, was so happy that he picked up 20,000 jin of manure in the winter. During the Spring Festival, 30,000 people in the county automatically worked. Recently, the sound of the county raising the red flag even higher has resounded in all directions. Everyone wants to catch up with the embroiderers and surpass the satellites, and no one can estimate the infinite power of this one county. But everyone I met attributed the power to the Party and the commune; then, how infinitely powerful are our Party and the people's commune!

As I left Wurenqiao and turned back to the county seat along the North Dike on the bank of the Sha River, I saw fertile mountains and fertile seas everywhere, and everywhere was a crowd of people like raging flames, and as far as the eye could see, there were wheat fields, and everywhere I looked, there was an endless green carpet! Yes, An Guo's wheat fields are all brocade, and the entire territory is carved into a sculpture. Are the happily working commune members merely planting crops? Aren't they representing our country's more than 600 million people, drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures on our motherland's land for an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward forever!

    安国麦田皆似锦
    本报特约记者　康濯
    正是“惊蛰”前后。春暖花开遍地绿，电闪雷鸣万物苏。在河北安国，迷人的春色和动人的春雷，今年可都并没能尽到最先惊动万物的职责。那里三十五万亩麦田的色彩，早已赶过了春光，引动得山川振奋齐欢笑和参观者不绝于途。
      农田整理如雕刻
    最近中共保定地委在安国召开的小麦丰产誓师大会上提出的农业生产口号中，有两句说道：“农田整理如雕刻，作物栽培似锦花。”这是干劲和科学结合的号召，这也是安国和全国许多地区的现实的写照。单说当时发出号召的会场外面，那大面积的小麦丰产方田，真个就是雕刻，就是织锦，是愧煞绣工和织女的描金绣花图。
    最惊人的，无疑是伍仁桥东风人民公社那成方似阵的丰产小麦。那给社员们叫做“天下第一田”的一千零十八亩土地，原是磁河回流岸上的“淤泥缝”，土质不坏，可就是“早晨软，上午硬，下午刨不动”。积水坑十六个，大小道数不清。历年歉收，县委常问当地干部和群众那块地怎么办。大跃进自有办法。公社化以后，人们想到当地卓头村亩产五千一百零三斤的“卫星”田，土质还赶不上这里；莫非这里就不能放出个“火箭”？决心一下，去年9月就动手。县委书记亲自参加。公社党委在那儿搭起窝棚，日干夜宿不离地。二百来人的专业队，三千人的临时突击队。收秋，腾地，填土……转眼之间，土地经过大平整，你甚至就描述为“垅沟一条线，地平如镜面”都嫌很不充分。举目望去，但见茫茫无际。有人说，面对那块千亩田，真要怀疑地球怎么会是圆的。那完全是方方正正的一片汪洋，特别是里面用秫秸篱笆围住的几百亩，更是斩齐如刀切。每一畦都是长三丈宽一丈，恰好五厘地。畦埂和垅沟，任你横看竖看，全都笔笔直直地延伸到远天边上。眼前刚刚返青的麦苗，密挤挤，绿茸茸，每一畦的每垅每行也都是手牵着手，连成直线达天边。整个方田中的大道，南北七条，东西五条，不用说，条条如箭路，相交成直角。畦埂和垅沟两侧的坡背，滑溜溜平展展，细琢细磨和精雕精刻，真是巧夺天工。原来整个公社给规定的质量就是六直四平：地面平，畦底平，垅沟平，田间大道平；地边直，地头直，垅沟直，畦背直，麦垅直，畦顶浪头直。请想想：这不是雕刻，不是锦绣，可又是什么！
    “待麦比待父母亲”
    眼目所见的如此情景，也许还只是所谓高级园田化的外表。透过外表，全部土地都深翻一尺五以上。全是层土层肥，玉米秸铺底。整地耙地共七次，整好地，耩麦又是三匀：肥匀，籽匀，浇水匀。四十辆胶皮车拉化肥，边拉边撒，声势浩大。播种了，每亩最少六十斤籽种，气氛可顿时紧张而哑静。最初每播一尺都得刨开检查一下，并且还先找了十几个技术老农进行试播。刘孝三耩了一遭，留下二两籽种；刘老胖接受了教训，可又多下了二两。于是这伙“老技术”耩一阵，坐下研究半天，再耩，再研究……最后才出师传艺，做到单垅每尺二十五粒左右。经过河北农业大学的同学检查，上下差不了两三粒！尽管这样，后来公社在老农们掌耧的地边插上“技术能手某某播种”的牌牌，阎老应老汉竟还不让给他插；他说：
      “我不行！我这播的还不定长得好不好呢！”
    不用说，现在麦苗都长得很好。主根粗壮，深翻七尺的根长六尺，翻五尺的长四尺挂零；而且平均分蘖三个，每亩达二百万株上下。但老农们可依然谨慎谦虚。我问刘老石，那一带的小麦每亩能不能打万斤，这个乐观而风趣的老汉装模作态地嚷道：“打不了！”但当旁边的宋老表说到小麦籽种下的可多哩，老石立即又说：“籽种多，可地也翻的深，肥也施的多啊！”老表跟着也说：“可不是！去年玉米高粱就有打到两三万斤的！往日常说年轻人粗心，现在你搁不住他们成天守在地里一苗一苗地整治，又还不是喷这个面面，就是喷那个水水的！”老石最后结论似地说：“是啊！你能说打不出万斤？只是咱们老脑筋，没见过吧！”
    老农们的观察是细微的。事实正是“一苗一苗地整治”。伍仁桥千亩田专业队的指导员李桂春告诉我，他们队里有些人的决心是“待麦比待父母亲”，另一些人则说：“待麦如待己呀，就像屋子冷了要生火，脑袋冷了要戴帽，脚冷了要穿棉鞋那样呀！”因此，这千亩田在深翻的时候检查质量，每块地就都要查三个地方；播种以后查补苗，五寸空白叫缺苗，一尺空白就叫断垅，自然都得全补上。浇水先是靠磁河岸上的锅驼机，现在已由四眼机井全部包上；那自然都是小水慢流，管保喝足。并且，浇水改畦可决不习惯地就近铲土堵旧畦口，而由另外的专人运来沙土垫上，以免把地面铲的坑坑洼洼，和防止水淤麦苗与冲垅沟，保持畦埂的牢固与平直。去冬浇头水以后，又是每亩三十斤肥田粉。松土是用特制的铁丝挠钩。为了拣去地里的小土坷丘，人们甚至跪在畦埂上，爬下身子，伸出轻巧的手指，就像是伸出了刻刀和绣针。
    整个冬天，真是一刀刀、一针针，经历了保苗、孳蘖和越冬期间的细耙、盖肥、盖沙以保安全的三个胜利的战役。都是两肥两水，蒙青肥又是每亩两万斤。立春以后，又按照苗儿生长情况，分别重轧、轻轧、浅耙、细耙；我亲眼看到专业队员们做到畦畦轧实，枯叶拔光，小步快走碾平，一叶不伤，一棵不漏。部分队员在春节都不下火线，把粗肥打碎耧细，弥补麦田的裂缝以防冷风。如今正是以肥为帅和准备“惊蛰”浇水，这里要做到十肥十水。伍仁桥化肥厂日产土化肥六万斤，千亩田并已攒下大粪二百多万斤和羊粪十五万斤；而且五亩一坑，三亩一缸，那方田周围的秫秸篱笆外面，不远处就有一排人造尿缸埋在地下，四遭包了密密的草垫，上边是精编的草盖。此外，观测员的地温计和地头的气象站，更随时给专业队传音报讯，正如给绣女和刻工送去创造的灵感和主题一般。
      竞争“元帅田”
    安国如雕似锦的麦田自然不止伍仁桥一处。仅仅县、社党委书记就分包了二十二个要求亩产万斤的丰产方。全县四十多万人民干劲震银河，雄心惊宇宙。“第一田”“第一峰”“魁元方”，还有“元首田”“太阳田”，方方块块都竞争精巧，县委统称“元帅田”。今年全县小麦保证亩产三千斤，争取五千斤，远远超过前些时省委小麦丰产座谈会上提出的“一季顶一年”的号召。不断革命的安国，前几年就没出现马鞍形，去年丰收中又创造了“革命的八个月，战斗的十六节”的经验，从2月开头的八个月，从“雨水”到“寒露”的十六节，月月节节，一笔一划而又声势浩荡；今年的麦田原订出了抓棵、抓穗、抓粒和防病、防虫、防倒伏六个管理关键，准备了从“惊蛰”到“小满”的五个高潮，真是细致微妙的措施而又风起云涌的运动。还不仅是麦田，伍仁桥公社已整好土地的万亩棉田方，也是参观的人流不断；而县委又正准备在县境北部搞一个“南北如带，东西如海”的更大的棉田方。
    在安国，眼目所及，实在感奋不尽。卓头村去年小麦亩产五千一百零三斤的创造者之一李造同，如今培植的麦田，有一个主根就分蘖四十八个，他并在暖房里作了小麦接玉米、接间草和接野麦等等试验。过去长工最多的穷村——中送，前年交公粮四万七千斤，可秋后倒救济三万斤和买回三万斤，这才够吃；去年却征购粮共拿十二万斤，现在生活还富富有余。敬老院里八十一岁的邢老铎竟至幸福得一冬就拾粪两万斤。春节期间，全县就有三万人自动干活。最近全县把红旗举得更高的声浪更响彻四方。人们个个都要赶绣女超卫星，谁也无法估量这一个县有着怎样无穷的威力。但我碰到的每一个人，可又都把威力归之于党和公社；那么，我们党和人民公社可又是怎样地威力无穷啊！
    当我离开伍仁桥，沿着沙河岸上的北大堤再折转县城，但见几十里途中处处是肥山肥海，处处是如熊熊火焰的人群，而又极目汪洋尽麦田，触眼无边尽绿毯！是的，安国麦田皆锦绣，全境俱为雕刻成。那欢欣劳动的公社社员，难道仅仅是在种庄稼？难道不是代表着我国六亿多人民，为了永远永远更大更好更全面的跃进，而在我们祖国的土地上画着最新最美的图画么！
