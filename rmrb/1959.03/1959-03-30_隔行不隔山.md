    Different Professions Don't Separate Us Like Mountains
    After reading the correspondence between Comrade Qian Sanqiang and Comrade Fang Ji regarding "Two Poems on Atomic Energy" (page 8, March 20), I have some thoughts.
    This is still a new thing. One is a scientist, and the other is a poet, and the two exchanged opinions on poetry. The scientist asked the writer to describe more scientific life. As the saying goes, different professions are like different mountains. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, this "mountain" has long been removed. When you look at the letters of the two of them, who would still feel that there is a mountain between the scientist and the writer? No. They are working together for the same goal, which is the promotion of the spirit of communist collaboration.
    Originally, living in the vast wilderness, the footprint of literature should be all-encompassing. The field of scientific life cannot be described as a "forbidden zone," but in the past, it has been reflected very little in literature, especially in the form of poetry. Now, poets have broken with convention and boldly tried, and this spirit is welcome.
    Although different professions don't separate us like mountains, it is still a new thing and needs to be carefully studied. If we do not understand modern science and technology, how can we write works that express the modern people's life and struggle?

    隔行不隔山
    看了钱三强同志和方纪同志关于“原子能两首”的通信（三月二十日八版），很有点感想。
    这还是新鲜事儿。一个是科学家，一个是诗人，俩人就诗歌交换了意见。科学家要求作家多描写科学生活。俗话说：隔行如隔山。在这大跃进的年代里，这个
  “山”早就被搬掉了，你看他们两位的信，谁还会感觉得科学家和文学家之间存在着一座山呢？不。他们同为了一个目标，这是共产主义大协作精神的发扬。
    本来，生活在辽阔的原野上，文学的足迹应该是无所不至的。科学生活这领域不能说成是“禁地”，但是过去在文学上的反映，确实是很少的，尤其是用诗歌形式来写。如今，诗人打破了陈规，大胆尝试，这种精神是值得欢迎的。
    隔行虽然不隔山，但终究是新的事物，需要认真学习。不懂得现代科学技术，又怎么能够写表现现代人民生活和斗争的作品呢？
