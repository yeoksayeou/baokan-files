    (Reported in this newspaper) Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, delivered a speech at a lecture meeting held by the Institute on the 12th for Asanuma Inejirō, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation visiting China. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    Friends, Comrades:
    Today, we are very pleased to be able to welcome the Japanese Socialist Party delegation headed by Mr. Asanuma Inejirō and to hear Mr. Asanuma's speech.
    The Japanese Socialist Party is an old friend to the Chinese people. In October 1954, we welcomed Mr. Suzuki Mosaburo, and in April 1957, we welcomed the Socialist Party goodwill delegation led by Mr. Asanuma, and issued a joint statement, expressing our common aspirations, which left a deep impression on the Chinese people. This time, with the Kishi Nobusuke government continuing its hostility towards the Chinese people and Sino-Japanese relations remaining extremely abnormal, the Socialist Party delegation headed by Mr. Asanuma is visiting our country in a friendly manner, which is of great significance for enhancing mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.
    In recent years, the Japanese Socialist Party has made a series of efforts to enhance the friendship between our two peoples, improve our two countries' relations, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, making great contributions. We, the Chinese people, express our heartfelt support and admiration for this.
    Originally, China and Japan were neighbors, and the two peoples had traditional friendly relations and economic and cultural exchanges in history. However, this traditional friendship was destroyed by Japanese militarism, causing misfortune to the peoples of both China and Japan. After the war, due to changes in the international situation, Japan was under the occupation of U.S. imperialism, Japan's national independence and sovereignty were violated, and the Japanese people's movement to get rid of the United States, demanding independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and friendly coexistence with neighboring countries, developed. In recent years, through the joint efforts of the two peoples, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples have further developed on a new basis. The Japanese Socialist Party has played a good role in the development of Sino-Japanese relations. It has repeatedly and clearly expressed its opposition to "two Chinas," advocated the restoration of diplomatic relations with our country, reflecting the Japanese people's desire for friendly and peaceful coexistence with neighboring countries, and proposed breaking the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" system, demanding the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and the realization of Japan's complete independence, and demanding that Japan take the path of peace and neutrality. It also called for a complete ban on the production, storage, and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, an immediate and unconditional ban on testing atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia. The Chinese people believe that these proposals, which are truly beneficial to Japan's prosperity and to peace in Asia, not only reflect the will of the Japanese people but also conform to the wishes of the Chinese, Japanese, and Asian peoples who love peace.
    However, U.S. imperialism is afraid of the unity and friendly coexistence of the Chinese and Japanese peoples. It is deliberately trying to permanently occupy Japan's Okinawa and Japan, and through the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, drive Japan to the front line of the U.S.-planned war of aggression, organize a Northeast Asian anti-communist military alliance, and realize its consistent conspiracy of Asians fighting Asians. As Mr. Asanuma pointed out: "U.S. imperialism is constantly expanding its forces in Okinawa, Japan, and Taiwan, China, forcibly dividing China and Japan into two parts." U.S. imperialism's aggression and occupation of the territories of China and Japan, and its use of them as bases for launching wars of aggression and military provocations, infringe upon the sovereignty and integrity of the two countries and seriously threaten the security of the two peoples. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples. Moreover, the United States has refused to reach an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing in the Geneva negotiations, while establishing nuclear weapons bases around the world, including the Far East and Japan, and stepping up the formation of aggressive military blocs, threatening peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, the Chinese people fully support Mr. Asanuma's assertion that "imperialism must disappear from Asia" and are willing to work together with friends from the Japanese Socialist Party in this common struggle to defend Asian and world peace.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government, which represents the potential imperialist forces in Japan, has completely violated the will of the Japanese people and adopted a policy of selling out the national interests of Japan, following the U.S. aggressors in every way, and adopting an open attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people, and has carried out a series of actions hostile to the Chinese people. Since last year, it has not only torn up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Private Trade Agreement, but has repeatedly condoned thugs to insult our national flag, conspired to create "two Chinas," attempted to revive militarism, and openly supported the United States in expanding its aggression against China, attempting to meddle in Taiwan, and actively engaged in economic expansion in Southeast Asia in order to relive its old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Since October last year, the Kishi Nobusuke government has also attempted to strengthen the suppression of the people by revising the "Police Duties Law" and has further colluded with the United States, attempting to accelerate the revival of militarism by revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, making Japan a U.S. atomic base and accomplice for aggression in the Asian region, and openly rejected the Japanese Socialist Party's proposal to submit a proposal for Japan's non-nuclear armament to the Diet, which fully exposed the reactionary potential imperialist face of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Kishi Nobusuke's series of reactionary policies and measures have been met with increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese people, making the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet increasingly unstable. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke, under pressure from the situation, has made various gestures, playing the old tune of separating politics and economics under the banner of restoring Sino-Japanese trade, attempting to shift the responsibility for continuing to僵化Sino-Japanese relations to the Chinese side. But Kishi Nobusuke's rhetoric and double-dealing tricks cannot deceive anyone. As the Japanese Socialist Party pointed out in its work plan for the first half of 1959: "After last year's general election, the reactionary nature of the Kishi cabinet was exposed. In order to establish a revised U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' (U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty, Pacific Military Alliance) system, it has been hostile to the people's China, a close neighbor, and has interrupted Sino-Japanese trade, pushing Japanese diplomacy into a dead end." The Chinese people must warn Kishi Nobusuke that as long as Kishi Nobusuke is determined to act as an accomplice of the United States in its aggression against China and Asia, and stubbornly continues to implement the reactionary policies of hostility towards China, creating two Chinas, and obstructing the restoration of normal Sino-Japanese relations, Sino-Japanese relations will not improve, Sino-Japanese trade will not be restored, and Kishi Nobusuke will only suffer the consequences.
    Similarly, these deceptive tricks of Kishi Nobusuke cannot deceive the Japanese people. A clear example is the "Conference to Demand the Crushing of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' System and the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," jointly convened by more than 40 organizations from all walks of life in Tokyo on February 28 this year, which launched a nationwide movement in Japan demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. A few days ago, Mr. Asanuma told me that the Kishi Nobusuke government advocates separating politics and economics, but I believe that the two are inseparable, especially in the relationship between countries, politics precedes economics. This correct proposition reflects the correct position of the Japanese Socialist Party, and the Japanese Socialist Party is precisely standing on this position and carrying out an active struggle against Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies, playing an undeniable role in the Japanese national movement. The day before yesterday, we saw that on March 10, the Japanese Socialist Party made a decision at a meeting of leading cadres to join forces with the Japanese Communist Party and 200 groups to form a "National Conference Against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." The joint action of all strata and democratic parties in Japan shows that the Japanese people's movement for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has entered a new stage. The continuation of this joint action will have a profound impact on the Japanese nation's struggle for independence, Sino-Japanese friendly relations, and Asian peace. And Kishi Nobusuke and other pro-American elements will suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind and the Japanese people who are determined to oppose U.S. aggression. We believe that the peoples of China and Japan will break through numerous difficulties and continue to develop their friendly relations. Any efforts made by friends from the Japanese Socialist Party to defend peace, oppose U.S. aggression, and improve Sino-Japanese relations will receive strong support from the Chinese people. And we wish the Socialist Party greater achievements in this regard.
    We believe that Mr. Asanuma's speech will further deepen our understanding of our friend, the Japanese Socialist Party, and leave us with an unforgettable impression. Welcome!

    岸信介敌视中国的政策只能自食其果  政治和经济分开的花言巧语骗不了人
    张奚若在演讲会上的讲话
    本报讯　12日在中国人民外交学会为日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎举行的演讲会上，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若发表了讲话。讲话全文如下：各位朋友、各位同志：
    今天，我们能够在这里欢迎以浅沼稻次郎先生为首的日本社会党访华代表团，并将听到浅沼先生讲话，感到十分高兴。
    日本社会党，对于中国人民说来，已经是老朋友了。1954年10月我们就欢迎过铃木茂三郎先生，1957年4月我们又欢迎了浅沼先生所率领的社会党亲善使节团，并发表了共同声明，表达了我们共同的愿望，给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。这一次在岸信介政府继续敌视中国人民、中日关系依然处于极不正常的情况下，以浅沼先生为首的社会党代表团来我国进行友好访问，对于增进中日两国人民的相互了解和友好关系具有很大的意义。
    几年来日本社会党，为了增进我们两国人民的友谊，改善我们两国的关系以及维护远东和世界的和平，进行了一系列的努力，作出了很大的贡献，对此我们中国人民表示衷心的支持和敬佩。
    本来，中日两国是近邻，两国人民在历史上有着传统的友好关系和经济、文化往来。但是这种传统的友谊，曾为日本军国主义所破坏，使中日两国人民遭受了不幸。战后由于国际形势变化，日本处在美帝国主义的占领下，日本的民族独立和主权受到侵犯，日本人民的亟欲摆脱美国要求独立、民主和平、中立、和同邻国友好相处的运动有所发展。几年来经过两国人民共同努力，中日两国人民的友好关系在新的基础上有了进一步的发展。日本社会党在中日关系的发展中起了良好的作用，它一再明确表示反对“两个中国”，主张同我国恢复邦交，反映了日本人民要求同邻国友好、和平共处的愿望，并提出打破“日美安全体制”、要求收回冲绳、小笠原群岛，收回美国军事基地，撤退美军，实现日本的完全独立和要求日本走向和平中立道路的主张，并要求全面禁止生产、储藏、使用原子弹和氢弹，立即无条件禁止试验原子弹和氢弹，在亚洲设立无核武装地带。中国人民认为，这些真正有利于日本的繁荣和有利于亚洲和平的主张，不仅反映了日本人民的意愿，而且符合于中、日两国人民和亚洲爱好和平人民的愿望。
    但是美国帝国主义却害怕中、日两国人民的团结和友好相处。它处心积虑地企图永远霸占日本的冲绳和日本，通过日美安全条约的修改，把日本驱上美国所筹划的侵略战争前线，筹组东北亚反共军事同盟，实现它所一贯策划的亚洲人打亚洲人的阴谋。正如浅沼先生所指出的：“美帝国主义在日本的冲绳、中国的台湾不断扩张势力，强把中国和日本分裂为两部分”。美帝国主义对中日两国领土的侵略和霸占，并利用它作为发动侵略战争和军事挑衅的基地，侵犯两国的主权完整，严重地威胁两国人民的安全，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。不仅如此，美国在日内瓦谈判中还拒绝就禁止核武器试验问题达成协议，同时却在世界各地包括远东和日本建立核子武器基地，并加紧拼凑侵略性军事集团，威胁远东和世界的和平。因此中国人民完全支持浅沼先生关于“帝国主义必须从亚洲消失”的主张，并愿在这保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同斗争中，同日本社会党朋友们一起努力奋斗。
    代表日本潜在帝国主义势力的岸信介政府却完全违反日本人民的意志，采取了出卖日本民族利益的政策，处处追随美国侵略者，对中国人民则采取了露骨的敌视态度，并做出了一系列敌视中国人民的行为。去年以来，它不仅撕毁了第四次中、日民间贸易协定，并一再纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗，阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图重新复活军国主义，并公然支持美国向中国扩大侵略，妄图染指台湾，并积极向东南亚进行经济扩张，以重温其“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。去年10月以来，岸信介政府又企图用修改“警职法”加强镇压人民，并进一步同美国狼狈为奸，企图通过修改日美安全条约加紧复活军国主义，使日本成为美国在亚洲地区进行侵略的原子基地和帮凶，并公然拒绝了日本社会党建议在国会上提出日本非核武装的提案，这就完全暴露了岸信介政府反动的潜在帝国主义面目。岸信介这一系列反动政策和措施，遭到了日本人民越来越强烈的反对，使岸信介内阁日益不稳，最近岸信介迫于形势，又做出种种姿态，打着恢复中日贸易的招牌，重弹政治、经济分开的老调，企图把中日关系继续僵化的责任推给中国方面。但是岸信介的这种花言巧语，两面三刀的伎俩是欺骗不了任何人的。正如日本社会党1959年上半年工作方针中指出的那样：“去年大选以后，暴露了岸内阁的反动本质，为确立修改日美‘安全条约’（日美共同防御条约，太平洋军事同盟）体系，而敌视近邻的人民中国，并使中日贸易中断，把日本外交推进了死胡同。”中国人民必须警告岸信介，只要岸信介决心充当美国侵略中国和亚洲的帮凶，执迷不悟地继续执行敌视中国，制造两个中国和阻挠中日正常关系恢复的反动政策，中日关系就无法好转，中日贸易也无法恢复，只能使岸信介自己自食其果。
    同样，岸信介这些欺骗伎俩也瞒不过日本人民，今年2月28日在东京举行的有四十多个各界团体联合召开的“要求粉碎日美‘安全条约’体系和恢复中日邦交”大会，在日本展开了如火如荼要求恢复中日邦交的国民运动，就是一个明显的例证。前几天浅沼先生对我说，岸信介政府主张政治和经济要分开，但我认为两者是不可分的，特别是国家与国家的关系上，政治先行于经济。这一正确主张反映了日本社会党的正确立场，而日本社会党正是站在这个立场上同岸信介的反动政策进行着积极斗争。在日本国民运动中起着不可忽视的作用。前天我们看到3月10日日本社会党在领导干部会上做出决定，同日本共产党和二百个团体联合行动，组成“反对日美安全条约国民会议”。日本各阶层和民主党派的联合行动说明日本人民要求独立、民主、和平和中立的运动，已经进入了新的阶段。这一联合行动的继续将对日本民族的争取独立，对日中友好关系，对亚洲的和平发生深远的影响。而岸信介等一小撮亲美派在东风压倒西风的国际形势和坚决反对美国侵略的日本人民面前遭到可耻的失败。我们相信，中日两国人民必将冲破重重困难，继续发展他们之间的友好关系。日本社会党的朋友们在保卫和平，反对美国侵略，改善中日关系等问题上所做的任何努力，都会得到中国人民大力支持的。并预祝社会党在这方面获得更大的成就。
    我们相信浅沼先生的讲演，会更进一步加深对我们的朋友——日本社会党的了解，给我们留下难忘的印象。欢迎！
