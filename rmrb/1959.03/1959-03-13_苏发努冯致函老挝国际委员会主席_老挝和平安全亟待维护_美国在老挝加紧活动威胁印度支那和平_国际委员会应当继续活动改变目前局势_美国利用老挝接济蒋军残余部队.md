Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th - Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao "Patriotic Newspaper" recently published a letter from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, to Lieutenant General Tara Singh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that since the International Commission's indefinite adjournment, the development of the situation in the country has shown many tendencies that endanger peace and tranquility.

The letter stated that Phoui Sananikone formed the current government, which is no longer a coalition government and has abandoned its policy of active neutrality. It is a government aimed at establishing a system of suppression and discriminating against and retaliating against former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and members of the Lao Patriotic Party.

The letter said that during the formation of the current government, an organization called the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" was established. The main task proposed by this organization is to assist and promote the current government in actively and fully implementing the policy of retaliation and suppression against former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and members of the Lao Patriotic Party.

The letter then listed the facts of the Lao Royal Government's unwarranted arrest and killing of former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and members of the Lao Patriotic Party in the provinces of Attopeu, Savannakhet, Khammouane, Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, and Sam Neua. The letter pointed out that some of these people were killed and arrested simply because they participated in the Lao Patriotic Party's election campaign or read the Lao Patriotic Party's newspaper.

The letter continued, saying that regarding the implementation of the provisions stipulated in the agreement for the merger of the Lao Royal Government Army and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, the current government has completely failed to carry out some of the existing work related to the merger, such as the appointment and selection of senior and junior officers, and the fixing of the establishment of various battalions that have been merged for nearly a year. On the contrary, the first measures taken by the current government were in violation of the agreements already signed. The current government recalled public officials who had been appointed and selected from the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, especially those from the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, such as the recall of the governor of Phongsaly Province, the deputy governor of Sam Neua Province, and four county chiefs.

In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong emphasized that after the current government took office, the activities of some foreigners in Laos were encouraged and assisted by the government. These activities are aimed at openly undermining the Geneva Agreements, creating tension, retaliating to threaten the tranquility and peace of Laos, destroying the harmonious atmosphere of Laos, and threatening the peace of Indochina.

The letter said that among these people, the most active are the Americans, especially personnel from the U.S. military aid, anti-communist propaganda, and psychological warfare agencies. Shortly after the current government came to power, many U.S. agencies appeared, and in various provinces, there were also agencies that bought land and construction companies. These U.S. agencies even obtained special approval from the government to set up radio transmitting and receiving stations in various places. In August and September 1958, U.S. military agencies transported thousands of carbines, heavy machine guns, mortars, and large quantities of ammunition into Laos.

The letter said that the military bases and the Seno air base handed over to the current Lao government by the former French authorities are now actually under the control of U.S. agencies and are becoming important military bases for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Currently, Civil Air Transport, under the entrustment of the U.S. Department of Defense, is transporting food and weapons to the troops of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group besieged on the border between China, Burma, Laos, and Thailand. These troops number about five thousand. The letter pointed out that the United States is supporting this group in order to carry out interference, provocation, and sabotage against the People's Republic of China. Another matter is that the current Lao government has allowed the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group to set up diplomatic representatives in Vientiane and has leased a house to them.

The letter said that the propaganda and espionage agencies of South Vietnam have also received assistance and encouragement from the current Lao government to carry out propaganda and provocations on the northern border. The letter then listed a large number of facts, pointing out that while the current Lao government is deliberately violating the agreements signed between the Royal Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and systematically undermining the Geneva Agreements, it is also constantly infringing upon the most basic democratic freedoms of the people, paving the way for the establishment of an anti-democratic and anti-people's dictatorial system.

In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong finally said: Therefore, the Lao Patriotic Party and I firmly believe that only the Lao International Commission can, through its legitimate, comprehensive, and timely activities, change the current situation in Laos, so as to maintain the peace and security of Laos in accordance with the Geneva Agreements, and especially to prevent foreign conspiracies and pressure from creating dictatorship and chaos in Laos.

  国际委员会应当继续活动改变目前局势
    美国利用老挝接济蒋军残余部队
    新华社河内12日电　万象消息：老挝“爱国报”最近刊登了老挝爱国党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王写给老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席塔拉·辛格·巴尔中将的一封信。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中指出，自从国际委员会不定期休会以来，这个国家的局势的发展有许多危害和平安宁的倾向。
    信中说，培·萨纳尼空组成了现任政府，这是一个不再具有联合政府性质的、废弃了积极中立政策的政府，是一个以建立镇压制度、对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党人进行歧视和报复为目的的政府。
    信中说，在成立现政府期间，一个名叫“保卫国家利益委员会”的组织成立了。这个组织提出的主要任务是帮助和促进现政府积极和充分执行对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党人进行报复和镇压的政策。
    信中接着列举了老挝王国政府在阿速坡、沙湾拿吉、甘蒙、琅勃刺邦、丰沙里、桑怒等省中，无故逮捕杀害前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党人的事实。信中指出，其中一些人之所以遭到杀害和逮捕，只是由于他们参加了老挝爱国党的竞选活动或阅读老挝爱国党的机关报。
    信中接着说，关于实现协定中所规定的将老挝王国政府军队和前寮国战斗部队合并的各项条款，现政府对现存的一些如任用和选任高级和初级军官、把已经合并将近一年的各营编制固定下来等有关合并的工作完全没有进行。反之，现政府首先做出的措施是违反已经签订的协议的。现政府召回了已经任用和选用的前寮国战斗部队的公职人员，特别是桑怒和丰沙里两省的人员，如召回丰沙里省省长，桑怒省副省长和四名县长。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中强调指出，现政府上任之后，一些外国人在老挝的活动获得政府的鼓励和帮助。这些活动旨在公开破坏日内瓦协议，制造紧张局势，进行报复以威胁老挝的安宁和和平，破坏老挝的和睦气氛，威胁印度支那和平。
    信中说，在这些人中，最积极的是美国人，尤其是美国军事援助、反共宣传和心理作战等机构的人员。在现政府上台不久，就出现了许多美国机关，在各省还设有收买土地、建筑公司等机构，这些美国机关甚至得到政府的特殊批准，在各地设置了无线电收发电台。1958年8、9月间，美国军事机关把成千支卡宾枪、重机枪、迫击炮和许多弹药运进了老挝。
    信中说，前法国当局交还老挝现政府的军事基地和塞诺空军基地，现在实际上已经在美国机关的控制下，并且正在变成东南亚条约组织的重要军事基地。目前，美国民航公司（Civil Air Transport）受美国国防部的委托，正在运送粮食和武器给在中缅、老泰边界上受到包围的台湾蒋介石集团的军队。这些军队约有五千人。信中指出，美国豢养这批人是为了向中华人民共和国进行干涉、挑衅和破坏。另一件事情是，老挝现政府让台湾蒋介石集团在万象设置外交代表，并且给他们租赁一所房屋。
    信中说，南越的宣传和间谍机构也获得老挝现任政府的帮助和鼓励，在北方的边界上进行宣传和挑衅。信中接着列举大量事实，指出老挝现政府在故意违反王国政府和前寮国战斗部队之间签订的协定和有系统地破坏日内瓦协议的同时，还在不断侵犯人民的最基本的民主自由权利，为建立反民主、反人民的独裁制度开辟道路。
    苏发努冯亲王最后在信中说：因此，老挝爱国党和我肯定地认为，只有老挝国际委员会才能通过它的合法、全面和及时的活动，改变老挝目前的局势，以按照日内瓦协议维护老挝的和平、安全，尤其是阻止外国的阴谋和压力在老挝制造独裁和混乱。
