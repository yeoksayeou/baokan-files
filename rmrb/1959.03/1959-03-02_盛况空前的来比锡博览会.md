The annual Leipzig Spring Fair has opened. This year's Leipzig Spring Fair is more magnificent than ever before. According to statistics, more than 9,500 units from 48 countries participated in this fair (including government delegations, trade delegations, and manufacturers, etc.). The exhibits of this fair are rich and varied in content and style, surpassing any other international fair. The exhibition area reaches 290,000 square meters.

In the central area of the fair, there are sixteen exhibition buildings, mainly displaying consumer goods and books. Our country's International Bookstore participates in the exhibition here every year. The technical fair venue has twenty-two exhibition halls, seventeen exhibition rooms, and an open-air exhibition area.

The achievements of socialist countries in the economic leap forward in 1958 are reflected in the fair, which is another feature of this fair. The exhibits of the host country, the German Democratic Republic, are the center of this fair. The exhibits focus on the machine manufacturing industry, including nearly 900 of the latest products. The Soviet Union's exhibits include more than one hundred train cars. A model of a space rocket was exhibited for the first time at the meeting, along with models of three artificial satellites.

Our country exhibited more than 7,000 exhibits at the fair, with an exhibition area of 6,000 square meters, an increase of 2,000 square meters compared to last year. Other socialist countries also exhibited their latest achievements.

The Leipzig Fair, with its long history of 800 years, has become one of the bridges for developing East-West trade. Many steel, machine manufacturing, and electrical machinery manufacturers in Western European capitalist countries also participated in this exhibition. Trade representatives from various countries will conduct extensive trade activities at the fair.

    盛况空前的来比锡博览会
    一年一度的来比锡春季博览会开幕了。今年的来比锡春季博览会，盛况是空前的。据统计，参加这次博览会的有四十八个国家的九千五百多个单位（包括政府代表团、贸易代表团和厂商等）。本届博览会的展品内容与样式丰富多采，是任何其他国际博览会都比不上的。展出面积达到二十九万平方公尺。
    在博览会的中心区有十六个展览大楼，这里主要展出消费品和书籍等。我国的国际书店每年在此参加展出。技术博览会的会场有二十二个展览馆、十七个展览厅，还有露天展览所。
    社会主义国家在1958年经济飞跃发展的成就，在博览会上得到反映，这是本届博览会又一特点。博览会的东道主德意志民主共和国的展品是这次博览会的中心。展品以机器制造工业为中心，其中有近九百种最新产品。苏联的展品有一百辆车皮以上。宇宙火箭的模型第一次在会上和三个人造卫星模型同时展出。
    我国在博览会上展出七千多种展品，展出面积比去年增加两千平方公尺，达六千平方公尺。其他社会主义国家也展出自己的最新成就。
    具有八百年悠久历史的来比锡博览会，已成为发展东西方贸易的桥梁之一。西欧资本主义国家许多钢铁、机器制造、电机等厂商也参加这次展出。各国贸易代表将在博览会上展开广泛的贸易活动。
