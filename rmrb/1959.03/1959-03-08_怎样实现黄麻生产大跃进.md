How to Achieve a Great Leap Forward in Jute Production
The CCP Guangfeng County Committee

Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, is located in a semi-mountainous, semi-hilly area with favorable natural conditions, suitable for growing cash crops. However, before liberation, only a small amount of local jute varieties were planted in the corners of fields. According to the 1949 statistics, the county's jute area was only 650 mu, with an average yield of only 180 jin per mu. After liberation, in 1951, the state called for vigorous development of jute production to support industry, and began to trial-plant Indian long-pod jute. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the increased enthusiasm of the masses, the jute planting area gradually expanded, and the yield increased year by year. By 1957, the sown area had expanded to more than 10,000 mu, with an average yield of 330 jin per mu. Last year, inspired by the new situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, while ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain production, jute production was also greatly developed. The actual jute harvest area in the county reached more than 25,000 mu, an increase of 117% over the previous year. And it achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 1,004 jin of dry jute fiber per mu.

The reasons why Guangfeng County's jute was able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest are mainly:

      Putting Politics in Command, Strengthening Leadership

In 1958, inspired by the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, our county, while ensuring the high-speed leap forward in grain production, conducted repeated debates on how to achieve a great leap forward in jute production, put forward advanced targets of ensuring 700 jin per mu and striving for 1,000 jin, and formulated practical and feasible leap forward plans. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, our county adopted the working method of the whole Party taking action, the deputy secretary taking specific charge, grasping production with one hand and ideology with the other, and vigorously carrying out mass movements. In order to gain experience and guide production, cadres at all levels also planted more than 2,000 mu of experimental fields. In terms of leadership methods, the county party committee made division of labor and responsibility, divided areas for contract, and included jute production in the agenda of the county party committee, often conducting research to strengthen specific leadership, and achieved "three grasps" (i.e., grasping ideology, grasping planning, grasping measures). Party organizations at the district, township, and commune levels also fixed a member of the Party committee to specifically manage jute production, strengthen specific leadership, and strengthen political work. Agricultural cooperatives also formed jute cultivation technology research groups composed of cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to closely integrate politics and technology.

Our political and ideological work runs through the entire process of jute production practice. When formulating plans, it was found that some people neglected the management of cash crops and doubted whether a great leap forward in jute production could be achieved. In response to the concerns of the masses, we launched an education movement to grow jute well throughout the county.

Through mass airing of views, big debates, conservatism was defeated, advanced elements were established, and everyone's understanding was improved, unanimously clarifying that jute is one of the raw materials for the country's heavy industry and must catch up with the rapid leap forward in grain production.

At the time of sowing, some commune members could not understand the idea of ​​promoting double-row close planting in strips. Based on these situations, while carrying out debates, we also made models on the spot. Through on-site visits, comparative discussions, it was clarified that close planting yields more than sparse planting, so that the close planting plan could be realized.

Just as the sowing season arrived, it was also met with continuous rain, which greatly hindered the sowing work, and some of the early plantings also suffered from missing seedlings and yellowing seedlings. At this time, some commune members developed negative and pessimistic emotions, believing that this year's jute production plan would fail. Therefore, we also adopted various forms such as field meetings and battlefield meetings to carry out debates, criticize pessimistic emotions, and boost everyone's enthusiasm for overcoming difficulties. In addition to improving the sowing methods, we also launched a shock movement week for jute field management after the rain.

            Unified Arrangement, Comprehensive Planning

In 1958, when realizing the great leap forward in agricultural production, the county party committee's requirement was "comprehensive leap forward, a hundred flowers blooming." In order to ensure the common leap forward of grain and various crops, unified arrangements and comprehensive planning were first made for land, fertilizer, and labor, so that contradictions such as competing for land, fertilizer, and labor were comprehensively resolved. In the vigorous manure accumulation campaign, while ensuring the use of fertilizer for grain crops, according to the characteristics of jute production, 500,000 jin of cake fertilizer from the current inventory was allocated to jute fields, and it was also stipulated that 25-40 jin of ammonium sulfate should be used per mu, thus ensuring the use of fertilizer for jute. In terms of labor arrangement, 10%-15% of the people usually carry out jute field management. During the jute harvesting and stripping period, it was the time of the national all-out attack on steel production, and labor was very tight. The county party committee also took timely measures to fully utilize the strength of women.

      Advanced Indicators, Practical Measures

In accordance with the spirit of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures," while determining advanced indicators and boosting the enthusiasm of the masses, appropriate measures were taken to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan.

    1. Selecting soil and practicing crop rotation. Generally, it is most suitable to choose sandy soil or purple oil mud with convenient irrigation and drainage, deep topsoil, and fertile soil, of which purple oil mud is better than sandy soil, which can increase production by more than 10%. The key to this year's bumper harvest is the implementation of the rice and jute rotation system. Facts have proved that the implementation of crop rotation not only increased rice production, but also ensured a bumper harvest of jute. Because rice field soil is immersed in water for a long time (three months), pests that harm jute, such as cutworms, mole crickets, and beetles, cannot reproduce and survive, which not only makes the soil conducive to jute growth, but also completely eliminates the phenomenon of root rot and broken stalks. Secondly, jute uses more fertilizer, but it cannot absorb all of it, and the residual twigs and rotten leaves of jute are left in the field, which can increase soil organic matter and improve soil structure.

    2. Deep plowing and appropriate close planting. In order to make full use of the land, deep plowing generally reaches eight inches, or even more than one foot. After three plowings and three harrows, the soil is finely granulated. Deep ditch and high ridge are promoted to facilitate irrigation and drainage. Generally, a complex close planting of 8×4 inch wide and narrow rows is adopted, with 30,000 to 45,000 plants per mu.

      3. Sow in a timely manner to prevent early flowering and branching. Early flowering and branching of jute will not only affect yield, but also reduce quality. According to the climatic conditions of Guangfeng, it is generally advisable to sow around "Summer Begins." It is not good to be too late, because it shortens the growing time, which will make the jute fiber thin and the yield low.

    4. Apply sufficient base fertilizer and top dressing in stages. Jute is a fertilizer-resistant crop and must be given enough fertilizer. Ammonium sulfate or human manure should be applied at the time of sowing, cultivating, earthing, and when the jute plant is about three feet tall. This can avoid wasting fertilizer and can meet the needs of jute seedling growth for fertilizer in a timely manner.

Strengthening cultivation, comprehensive irrigation and drainage; selecting good varieties, doing a good job in seed retention fields; mastering the heat, and harvesting and stripping in a timely manner are also three major items in the county's jute production increase measures.

    怎样实现黄麻生产大跃进
    中共广丰县委会
    江西广丰县属半山区半丘陵地带，自然条件较好，适宜种植经济作物。但是在解放前，只在田头地角栽植少量的土种黄麻。根据1949年的统计，全县黄麻面积只有六百五十亩，平均亩产仅一百八十斤。解放后，1951年国家号召大力发展黄麻生产支援工业，才开始试种印度长果种黄麻。由于党的正确领导和群众生产积极性的提高，黄麻种植面积逐渐扩大，产量年年上升。到1957年，播种面积扩大到一万多亩，平均亩产三百三十斤。去年在全面大跃进的新形势的鼓舞下，在保证粮食生产全面大丰收的同时，又大量发展了黄麻生产。全县黄麻实收面积达二万五千多万亩，比前年扩大了117％。并取得了空前大丰收，平均亩产干麻皮一千零四斤。
    广丰县黄麻能够取得空前大丰收的原因，主要是：
      政治挂帅，加强领导
    1958年在全面大跃进的鼓舞下，我县在保证粮食生产高速跃进的同时，对如何实现黄麻生产大跃进开展了反复的辩论，提出保证实现亩产七百斤，争取一千斤的先进指标，并制订出切实可行的跃进计划。为了保证实现这个计划，我县采取了全党动手，副书记具体掌握，一手抓生产，一手抓思想，大搞群众运动的工作方法。为了取得经验，指导生产，各级干部还种植了二千多亩试验田。在领导方法上，县委作了分工负责，划片包干，并把黄麻生产列入县委的议事日程，经常进行研究，加强具体领导，做到了“三抓”（即抓思想、抓计划、抓措施）。区、乡、社的党组织也固定了一个党委委员，专管黄麻生产，加强具体领导和加强政治工作。农业社还由干部、老农和技术员成立了黄麻栽培技术研究小组，做到政治和技术紧密结合。
    我们的政治思想工作，是贯串在整个黄麻生产实践过程中的。在制订计划时，发现部分群众忽视经济作物经营，和怀疑能否实现黄麻生产大跃进。针对群众的思想顾虑，我们在全县掀起一个种好黄麻的教育运动。
    通过群众性的大鸣大放大辩论，击破保守，树立了先进，提高了大家的认识，一致明确了黄麻是国家重工业原料之一，必须随着粮食生产的迅速跃进而赶上去。
    在播种时，有些社员对推行双行密植条播思想闹不通。根据这些情况，一面开展辩论，一面实地做出样子，通过现场参观、对比讨论，明确了密植比稀植增产，使密植计划得到实现。
    正当播种时节，又逢阴雨连绵，使播种工作受到很大障碍，早种的一部分也发生缺株和幼苗枯黄的现象。这时，部分社员就产生了消极悲观情绪，认为今年黄麻生产计划落空了。因此，我们又采取了田头会、战地会等种种形式，开展了辩论，批判了悲观情绪，鼓起了大家克服困难的积极性，除了改进下种办法外，还在雨后开展了黄麻田间管理突击运动周。
            统一安排，全面规划
    在实现农业生产大跃进的1958年里，县委的要求是“全面跃进，万紫千红”。为了保证粮食和各项作物共同跃进，首先对土地、肥料和劳力等都做了统一安排，进行了全面规划，使争田、争肥和争劳力等矛盾全面解决。在大闹积肥运动中，在保证粮食作物用肥的同时，根据黄麻生产的特点，抽出当时库存的五十万斤饼肥用在黄麻田里，还规定每亩要用硫酸铵二十五—四十斤，因此，保证了黄麻的用肥。在劳力安排上，平常都有10％—15％的人进行黄麻田间管理。在黄麻收剥期间，正值全民猛攻钢铁生产的运动中，劳力很紧张。县委又及时采取措施，全面利用了妇女力量。
      指标先进，措施切实
    根据“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神，在确定先进的指标和鼓足群众干劲同时，采取了得当的措施，保证了跃进计划的实现。
    1、选择土壤，实行轮作。一般以选择排灌方便、表土深厚，土质肥沃的沙质土或紫油泥为最适宜，其中紫油泥比沙质土更好，可增产10％以上。今年丰收的关键是实行了稻、麻轮作制度。事实证明，实行轮作既增加了稻谷产量，又保证了黄麻丰收。因为稻田土壤长期
  （三个月）浸入水中，危害黄麻的害虫如地老虎、蝼蛄、金龟子等，就不能繁殖和生存，不但能使土壤有利于黄麻生长，而且还可完全消灭烂根断株现象。其次，黄麻用肥较多，但不能全部吸光，而且黄麻的残梢烂叶都留在田中，可以增加土壤有机物质和改良土壤结构。
    2、实行深耕，适当密植。为了充分利用地力，一般深耕达八寸，甚至一尺以上。经过三犁三耙，做到土细粒碎。推行深沟高畦，以利排灌。普遍采用8×4寸的宽窄行复式密植，每亩有三万到四万五千株。
      3、适时播种，防止早花分杈。黄麻早花分杈，不仅会影响产量，而且会降低质量。按广丰气候条件，一般以“立夏”左右播种为宜。过迟也不好，因为缩短了生长时间，会使麻皮薄，产量低。
    4、下足基肥，分期追肥。黄麻是一种耐肥较强的作物，必须下足肥料。播种、中耕、培土和黄麻株高达三尺左右时，都要施硫酸铵或人粪尿。这样可以避免浪费肥料，又能及时满足麻苗生长对肥分的需要。
    加强培育，全面排灌；选择良种，搞好留种田；掌握火候，及时收剥，也是这个县黄麻增产措施中的三个主要项目。
