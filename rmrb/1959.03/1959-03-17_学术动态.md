The Law Department of Renmin University of China Holds Academic Discussions
Debating the Relationship Between Law and Policy

The Law Department of Renmin University of China, in order to improve teaching quality and promote scientific research, has recently organized its graduating students to conduct two academic discussions on fundamental issues of law. The specific topics discussed were: What is law, and where does it come from? What is the relationship between law and policy? There were debates in the discussions, especially regarding the relationship between law and policy. The main points of contention were two. One question was: Is policy the same as law? Regarding this issue, some comrades believed that policy is a manifestation of law, some believed that policy is not law, and others believed that the two are related but cannot be equated. The second question was: Does policy have coercive power? There were also three views on this question: one believed it did, one believed it did not, and another believed that some policies did, and some did not. These issues are of current concern to legal scholars. The different views and arguments presented in the discussion are introduced below.

On the Question of Whether Policy is the Same as Law

The comrades who believe that policy is the same as law hold the following reasons: (1) Both policy and law are manifestations of the will of the ruling class, determined by and serving the same economic base, and possess coercive power, which shows that their essential attributes are the same; (2) The formal manifestations of law are diverse, and law is only one of the forms of expression of law, and it has limitations. Policy, on the other hand, can timely reflect the will and requirements of the ruling class in various periods, is flexible, and is the best law. Some comrades also believe that law includes the ruling class's policies and laws (including decrees, regulations, etc.), and policy is the main form of law, as well as the soul and foundation of law. This shows that policy is essentially law.

Comrades who firmly oppose this view believe that policy is not law in form or substance. Policy is politics. Policy guides everything in the country, and it is higher than law. Therefore, it is wrong to equate policy with law. As for saying that policy is law and the soul of law, it is a logical error. They also believe that this view would reduce the Party's leading role in the state, reduce the guiding role of policy in various tasks, legalize our social life, and prevent the flexibility of policy and the relative stability of law from being expressed, which is detrimental to practical work.

Comrades who advocate that policy and law cannot be equated believe that the relationship between policy and law is close and inseparable, both are determined by and serve the same economic base, develop and change with the development and change of the economic base, and are both manifestations of the will of the ruling class, possessing coercive power. However, we must never equate policy and law for this reason. It should be clear that policy is the soul of law, and law is the concretization of policy and the tool to achieve policy. Because policy is formulated by the ruling class based on the situation of class struggle and the current political situation, it is the concentrated expression of the will of the ruling class. Policy is made into law according to practical needs; at the same time, law is relatively specific and has relative stability. Therefore, when applying the law, in order to suit the specific circumstances of the time and place, we must also rely on policies that are both principled and flexible in execution. In addition, policy includes a wide range of aspects, and when implementing policy, it can be achieved not only through law, but also through other superstructures such as literature, art, and education. Law is merely a concretization and codification of things based on policy, and is a tool for achieving policy. Therefore, the difference between policy and law can only be clarified after studying their relationship.

On the Question of Whether Policy Has Coercive Power

Comrades who advocate that policy has coercive power believe that policy reflects the will of the ruling class and must be backed by state power. When implementing policies, coercive methods are adopted against the enemy, and persuasive education methods are adopted against the people. However, those who violate policies among the people must also be punished, which is also coercion, but of a different nature. Therefore, some policies are guaranteed by state coercive power, and some are guaranteed by persuasive education and administrative sanctions.

Comrades who advocate that policy does not have coercive power believe that coercive power refers to that backed by state coercive power. Policy is mainly promoted through persuasive education, so it does not have coercive power.

Comrades who believe that some policies have coercive power and some do not, used examples for argumentation. They said that policies such as "Let a hundred flowers bloom" have no coercive power. Some comrades said that whether a policy has coercive power depends on our needs, and generally speaking, it has coercive power.

The graduating class of the Law Department of Renmin University of China plans to use ten weeks this semester to conduct research and discussion on such specialized issues. The issues to be discussed in the future include: (1) Who creates the law, and where does the source of our country's law lie? (2) The form and characteristics of our country's law; (3) The role of law in the period of socialist construction; (4) The remnants and nature of bourgeois rights, etc.

    中国人民大学法律系举行学术讨论会
    争论法和政策的关系
    中国人民大学法律系为提高教学质量和促进科学研究工作，最近两周来，组织应届毕业生，进行了两次关于法的基本问题的学术讨论。讨论的具体题目是：什么是法，法从何来？法和政策的关系怎样？在讨论中有争论，特别是关于法和政策的关系问题争论较大。争论的主要问题有两个。问题之一是：政策是否就是法。关于这个问题，有的同志认为政策是法的一种表现，有的同志认为政策不是法，另一些同志则认为两者有关系，但不能划等号。问题之二是：政策有无强制力。关于这个问题也有三种看法，一种认为有，一种认为没有，另一种认为有的政策有，有的政策没有。这些问题是当前法学工作者比较关心的。现将讨论中出现的不同观点和论据介绍于下。
    关于政策是否就是法的问题
    认为政策就是法的同志所持理由是：（1）政策和法同是统治阶级的意志体现，是由同一经济基础决定并为其服务的，具有强制性，这说明它们本质属性是相同的；（2）法的形式表现又是多种多样的，法律仅是法的表现形式之一，而且有局限性，政策却能及时反映各个时期统治阶级的意志和要求，有灵活性，是最好的法。有的同志还认为，法包括统治阶级的政策和法律（包括法令、条例等），政策是法的主要形式，又是法律的灵魂和基础。这说明政策实质上是法。
    坚决反对这种看法的同志认为，政策从形式上、实质上都不是法。政策就是政治。政策指导国家的一切，它比法高。因此把政策与法相提并论是不对的。至于说政策是法，又是法律的灵魂，更是逻辑上的错误。并认为这种看法会降低党在国家中的领导作用，降低政策在各项工作中的指导作用，使我国社会生活法律化，使政策的灵活性和法的相对稳定性不能表现出来，对实际工作不利。
    主张政策和法不能划等号的同志认为，政策和法的关系密切不可分，都是由同一经济基础决定并为其服务的，随着经济基础的发展、变化而发展、变化，而且也都是统治阶级的意志体现，具有强制力。但是绝不能因此就把政策和法划上等号。应该明确，政策是法的灵魂，法是政策的具体化，是实现政策的工具。因为政策是统治阶级根据阶级斗争情况、当前政治形势制订的，是统治阶级意志的集中表现，政策根据实践需要制成法律；同时法律比较具体，具有相对的稳定性，因而在运用法律时为了适合当时、当地的具体情况，也必须依靠既有原则性，在执行中又有灵活性的政策。此外，政策包括面广泛，实现政策时不但可以通过法律，而且也可利用文艺、教育等其他上层建筑，法律只不过是依据政策制订的具体化、条文化的东西，是实现政策的工具。因此，政策与法的区别，只有在研究了它们的关系之后才能弄清。
    关于政策有无强制力的问题
    主张政策有强制力的同志认为，政策是反映统治阶级的意志，必须以国家强力为后盾。在执行政策时，对敌人是采取强制的方法，对人民是采取说服教育的方法。但对人民中违反政策者也要处罚，也是强制，只是性质不同。所以政策有的以国家强制力作保证，有的以说服教育、行政处分作保证。
    主张政策没有强制力的同志认为，强制力是指以国家强制力为后盾的，政策主要是以说服教育来推行，所以没有强制力。
    认为有的政策有强制力，有的政策没有强制力的同志，用实例进行了论证，他们说，如百花齐放等政策就无强制力。有同志则说，政策有无强制力要看我们的需要，一般来说是有强制力的。
    中国人民大学法律系应届毕业班，本学期预定利用十周时间，就这类专门问题进行研究讨论，今后将要讨论的问题有：（1）法是谁创造的，我国的法源何在？（2）我国法的形式、特点；（3）社会主义建设时期法的作用；（4）资产阶级式的权利的残余、性质，等等。
