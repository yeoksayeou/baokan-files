The heroic struggle of the people of Nyasaland, Central Africa, against British colonial rule and racial oppression has shaken the entire British colonial position in Africa. British newspapers also admit that this is a fuse that will ignite a fire burying colonialism in Central Africa, East Africa, and even all of Africa.

The three regions of Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia in the Central African Federation, as well as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika in East Africa, are the last major colonies of British imperialism in Africa. The so-called Rhodesian and Nyasaland Federal Government is composed of a group of the most stubborn white politicians, racists, and fascists. They rely on brutal high-pressure tactics to ensure the exploitation and extraction of local people by British and American capital. Now, the explosion has occurred in this key area that British colonists thought they firmly controlled.

The current struggle of the people of Central Africa is not only more extensive than ever before but also has clear political goals. The flames of resistance have been ignited in more than thirty places throughout Nyasaland, and the people are demanding an end to the Central African Federation, freedom from racial oppression, and national independence. "Oppose white rule" has become a unanimous slogan for Africans. Filled with hatred for colonial rule, the broad masses of the people bravely fought the colonial military police with bare hands and primitive weapons, destroying roads and bridges, and even occupying airports. The anti-colonial wave in Nyasaland not only excites Northern Rhodesia but also affects Southern Rhodesia, the so-called "cornerstone of the Central African Federation structure." The general strike of more than six thousand African workers at the Kariba Dam project in Southern Rhodesia was not only for economic demands but also advocated political independence. The struggle of the people in this region of Central Africa has formed a coordinated and integrated situation, and its depth and influence have greatly developed compared with the movement of the people of Central Africa against the establishment of the Federation by Britain in 1953.

The struggles of the people of Nyasaland and Central Africa are stimulating each other with the struggles of the people in other parts of Black Africa, creating a chain reaction and pushing the national independence movement in Africa south of the equator to a new climax. Recently, the struggle against racial oppression, demanding freedom, democracy, and independence, and striving for increased wages has not only been carried out in British Central Africa and East Africa but also throughout South Africa, a British dominion, as well as Portuguese Mozambique and the Belgian trust territory of Ruanda-Urundi. The population involved in the struggle accounts for nearly 70% of the total population of Africa south of the equator, and the area accounts for more than 71%. In the remaining Angola, Bechuanaland, and Southwest Africa, the colonialists are trembling with fear.

Faced with the situation in which the Central and East African colonies of British colonial authorities are shaken to their foundations, they continue to adopt a consistent method of supplementing violent suppression with political deception in an attempt to stabilize their position.

British officials admit that as of March 11, the colonial army had massacred forty-one Africans in suppressing this resistance movement of the people of Nyasaland, and hundreds of patriots had been imprisoned in Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia. At the same time, the British authorities are arresting African leaders on a large scale in Kenya. Brutal rule and bloody suppression have always been the true colors of British colonialists. During the 1952-1955 period, Britain massacred no less than 10,000 Africans in the war against the rebellious people of Kenya. In Central and East Africa, whipping, corporal punishment, and forced labor of African prisoners are even more common barbaric acts. However, not only has resistance not stopped, but it has also expanded. The British bourgeois press also pointed out that the colonial authorities' violent suppression in Nyasaland only makes the people's resistance "reach a boiling point."

British colonialists realize that it is impossible to retain the original colonial system intact. Therefore, while carrying out violent suppression, they also adopted political deception, touting so-called "constitutional reforms" and superficially increasing the number of African parliamentarians as a gesture of concession. However, the "constitutions" formulated by Britain in its West African, Central African, and East African colonies not only do not reflect the national sovereignty that the local people should enjoy but also do not provide even superficial guarantees of the civil rights of Africans. These so-called "constitutions" invariably give the highest power to the British Governor. The colonialists used various restrictions to deprive more than 90% of Africans of the right to vote, ensuring the absolute control of white immigrants in the parliament and only inserting a few African parliamentarians as decorations in dozens of seats. The British colonial authorities also tried to win over and buy off certain national degenerates among Africans to create divisions and undermine the national independence movement. Now, the Nyasaland colonial government has announced that it will negotiate with "tame African politicians" other than the African National Congress, which firmly opposes British colonial rule, to divide the independence movement.

But the African people have seen through these tricks. They are increasingly determined to demand national independence, guarantee the basic democratic rights of Africans, achieve genuine universal suffrage, and oppose racial discrimination. In Kenya and Tanganyika, the British colonial authorities are facing a so-called "constitutional crisis," and the people refuse to submit to the British-imposed "constitution" that deprives Africans of their rights.

The struggle of the people of British Central Africa is a new outbreak following the anti-imperialist movements in the Belgian Congo, French Congo, North Africa, and British East Africa. It shows that the national awakening of the entire Africa, the situation will go to boiling.

The colonial rule of Britain, one of the most important colonial powers on the "dark continent," is coming to an end. At the end of the nineteenth century, Cecil Rhodes, a famous British colonial adventurer in South Africa and Central Africa (Rhodesia is named after him), once proudly said: "If there is a God, he will be happy to paint most of the African map in the colors of the British Empire for me." But today, the thunder of the African people striving for freedom and independence has shattered the colonists' dreams. The African map stained by colonial imperialism will soon restore its pure color.

    反殖民的怒火照亮了非洲大陆  争自由的雷声粉碎了殖民迷梦
    中非人民前仆后继奋勇冲击殖民统治新华社记者述评
    中非尼亚萨兰人民反对英国殖民统治和种族压迫的英勇斗争使英国在非洲的全部殖民阵地发生了动摇。英国报纸也承认这是一根导火线，它将使中非和东非以至全非洲燃起埋葬殖民主义的大火。
    中非联邦的尼亚萨兰和南北罗得西亚三个地区以及东非的怯尼亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀是英帝国主义在非洲的最后的主要殖民地。所谓罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦政府是由一批最顽固的白种政客、种族主义者和法西斯主义者组成的。他们依靠残酷的高压手段来保证英国和美国资本对当地人民的剥削和榨取。现在，爆炸就发生在这个英国殖民者自以为是牢牢控制着的要害地区。
    中非人民当前的斗争，不但规模比以往任何时期都要广泛，而且具有鲜明的政治目标。尼亚萨兰全境三十多个地方都燃起了反抗的怒火，人民要求结束中非联邦，摆脱种族压迫，取得民族独立。“反对白种人的统治”成了非洲人一致行动的口号。广大人民满怀着对殖民统治的仇恨，赤手空拳，用原始的武器与殖民军警英勇搏斗，破坏公路桥梁，甚至占领飞机场。尼亚萨兰的反殖民巨浪不但激动着北罗得西亚，而且影响到所谓“中非联邦结构基石”的南罗得西亚。南罗得西亚卡里巴水坝工程的六千多非洲工人的总罢工不仅是为了经济要求，而且主张政治独立。中非这个地区人民的斗争已经形成了互相配合、连成一气的形势，它的深度和影响，比起1953年中非人民反对英国成立联邦的运动来，已经大大发展了一步。
    尼亚萨兰和中非人民的斗争正在与黑非洲其他地区人民的斗争相互激发，造成连锁反应，把赤道以南非洲的民族独立运动推向新的高潮。最近以来，反对种族压迫、要求自由民主和独立、争取增加工资的斗争不仅在英属中非和东非开展，而且遍及于英国自治领的南非以及葡属莫三鼻给、比利时托管地卢安达—乌隆迫。卷入斗争的人口占赤道南非洲全部人口的将近70％，面积占71％以上。剩下来的安哥拉、贝专纳和西南非洲，那里的殖民主义者也都在胆战心惊。
    英国殖民当局在中非和东非殖民地连根动摇的局势下，继续采取一贯的暴力镇压和政治欺骗互为补充的手段，企图稳住阵脚。
    英国官方承认，截至3月11日为止，殖民军在镇压尼亚萨兰人民这次反抗运动中，已经屠杀了四十一名非洲人，在尼亚萨兰和南北罗得西亚，数以百计的爱国者被关进监狱。英国当局同时在怯尼亚大肆逮捕非洲人领袖。残暴统治和血腥镇压，原是英国殖民者的本色，在1952—1955年期间，英国在对怯尼亚起义人民的战争中屠杀的非洲人不下一万人。在中非和东非，对非洲犯人施行鞭打、肉刑、强迫劳动更是习以为常的野蛮行为。但是，反抗不但没有停止，反而更加扩大了。英国资产阶级的报纸也指出，殖民当局在尼亚萨兰的暴力镇压只有使人民的反抗“达到沸腾的程度”。
    英国殖民主义者认识到要原封不动地保留原有的殖民制度已经不可能了，因此在暴力镇压同时，又采取了政治欺骗手法，标榜所谓“宪法改革”，表面上增加一些非洲人的议员作为让步姿态。但是，英国在西非、中非和东非殖民地所制定的“宪法”不但根本没有反映当地人民应当享有的国家主权，而且也没有规定那怕是表面的对非洲公民权利的任何保障。这些所谓“宪法”毫无例外地把最高权力交给英国总督。殖民者用种种限制剥夺了90％几的非洲人的选举权，保证了白种移民在议会中的绝对控制，只是在几十个议席中安插上几个非洲籍议员作装饰品。英国殖民当局还在非洲人中间拉拢收买某些民族败类，制造分裂，以破坏民族独立运动。现在，尼亚萨兰殖民政府就又宣布要同坚决反对英国殖民统治的非洲人国民大会以外的“温顺的非洲政治家们”进行谈判，以便分化独立运动。
    但是非洲人民已经看破了这些手段，他们越来越坚决地要求民族独立，要求保障非洲人的基本民主权利，实现真正的普选，反对种族歧视。在怯尼亚和坦噶尼喀，英国殖民当局正面临着所谓“宪法危机”，人民拒绝向剥夺非洲人权利的英国钦定“宪法”屈服。
    英属中非人民的斗争是继比属刚果、法属刚果、北非和英属东非各地反帝运动之后的新的爆发，它显示出整个非洲的民族觉醒，局势将走向沸腾。
    “黑暗大陆”上最主要的殖民国家之一的英国的殖民统治已经是末日将临了。十九世纪末英国在南非和中非的著名殖民冒险家西塞尔·罗得斯（罗得西亚就是以他的名字命名的）曾经得意地说：“如果有上帝的话，他会为我尽量把大部分的非洲地图涂上英帝国的颜色而感到高兴。”但是今天非洲人民争取自由独立的霹雳雷声粉碎了殖民者的迷梦。为殖民帝国主义所沾污的非洲地图很快就要恢复它清白的颜色。
