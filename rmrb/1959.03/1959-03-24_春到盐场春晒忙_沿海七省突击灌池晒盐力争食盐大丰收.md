Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Spring has arrived, marking the prime season for sun-drying sea salt. Salt industry workers and salt farmers in China's seven coastal provinces have successively plunged into the battle to strive for a bumper harvest of edible salt this year.

　　In the northern coastal provinces, where spring has arrived but the chill remains, the salt fields are already a hive of activity. Many salt fields on the Liaodong Peninsula began the battle of breaking ice and cultivating brine as early as the deep winter, and carried out large-scale preparations for spring sunning, including compacting and improving the salt fields. Now, the workers and farmers of various salt fields are busy with filling ponds and sun-drying salt. The Shuangdao Salt Field in Lushun has already begun producing new salt. In the famous Changlu Salt District of Hebei, on the hundreds of miles of salt fields along the Bohai Sea, pairs of rapidly turning windmills are interwoven with the white sails of salt-carrying boats, creating a moving picture. The salt workers here broke the old convention of "salt appearing only after the Qingming Festival" long ago. By March 15th, they had already sun-dried more than 30,000 tons of spring salt. At present, most of the crystallization ponds here are filled again. The salt fields on the Shandong Peninsula have also entered the intense battle of brine production and pond-filling for spring sunning.

　　In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang coastal salt fields, stretching for thousands of miles, the spring sunning campaign has already achieved initial success. The salt produced by the salt fields of Zhejiang since the beginning of spring sunning has greatly exceeded the highest production level of the same period in history. The salt fields in Jiangsu started sunning in late February, and by March 17th, they had produced 220,000 dan of new salt. This year, the area of salt fields put into production in Zhejiang totals more than 180,000 mu, with a planned output to double that of last year. The dozens of salt fields put into production in Jiangsu are also striving to complete the annual salt production task of 1.68 million tons in the first half of the year. At present, salt workers and farmers in the two provinces are launching a vigorous socialist competition to achieve this year's leap-forward targets.

　　In Guangdong and Fujian provinces, where spring arrives early, although there are often drizzling rains, the salt fields still seize the rare sunny weather and launch a struggle to turn the slack season for salt production into a peak season. Tens of thousands of salt workers and farmers in Guangdong Province hurriedly started wind-powered water-lifting machines and foot-operated waterwheels as soon as the weather cleared, rapidly pouring the brine stored in the brine tanks during the rainy days into the salt fields for spring sunning. The salt they produced in the past two months has increased by more than one and a half times compared with the same period last year. After battling against the continuous rains, the salt fields in Fujian Province had produced more than 33,000 tons of new salt by March 15th. (Attached picture)

    春到盐场春晒忙
    沿海七省突击灌池晒盐力争食盐大丰收
    据新华社23日讯　海盐春晒大好时节来到了，我国沿海七省盐业职工和盐民们已先后投入了力争今年食盐大丰收的战斗。
    在春令虽到寒意未消的北方滨海省份，各个盐场上已是一片活跃景象。辽东半岛上的许多盐场，早在隆冬季节就开展了破冰养卤的战斗，并且进行了规模巨大的春晒前的准备工作——压固和改良盐田；现在，各盐场职工和盐民都在紧张地忙着灌池晒盐。旅顺双岛盐场已经开始出新盐了。在著名的河北长芦盐区，在那绵延数百里的渤海边盐场上，对对急转的风车同白帆点点的运盐船交织成一幅动人的图景。这里的盐工们早就破除了“清明才见盐”的陈规，到3月15日已经晒出春盐三万多吨。目前这里的结晶池又大都灌满了。山东半岛上各盐场也已进入紧张的制卤和灌池春晒的战斗。
    绵延千里的江苏和浙江海滨各盐场，春晒战役已经初奏凯歌。浙江各盐场春晒以来已产的盐，大大超过了历史上同期最高的生产水平；江苏各盐场从2月下旬开晒，到3月17日就产了新盐二十二万担。今年，浙江投入生产的盐田面积共达十八万亩以上，计划产量要比去年翻一番；江苏投入生产的几十个盐场，也力争在上半年内完成全年产盐一百六十八万吨的任务。现在，两省盐工盐民为实现今年的跃进指标正在开展着热火朝天的社会主义竞赛。
    春意早到的广东和福建省，尽管时常细雨蒙蒙，但是各盐场依然抓紧难得的晴朗天气，展开了变产盐淡季为旺季的斗争。广东省数万盐工和盐民，一遇晴天就急忙开动风力扬水车和脚踏水车，把阴雨天蓄存在卤缸里的卤水迅速灌送到盐田进行春晒。他们在最近两个月里所产的盐，比去年同期增长了一倍半以上。福建省各盐场经过同连绵阴雨搏斗，到3月15日已经制出新盐三万三千多吨。（附图片）
