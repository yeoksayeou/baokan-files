Education combined with productive labor – does it affect the quality of teaching? This has been a point of contention in implementing the Party's education policy, but practice has now resolved this issue.

More than half a year of practice at Wuhan University has proven that the result of combining education with productive labor is a significant improvement in teaching quality. Incorporating productive labor into the teaching plan has not only profound theoretical significance but also profound realism.

Those who oppose or doubt the Party's education policy, when they present various arguments against it, seem to acknowledge that incorporating productive labor into the teaching plan will inevitably promote students' ideological transformation and enhance their physical fitness. However, they consider these aspects to be unrelated or only slightly related to teaching quality. They argue that ideological awareness is a matter of political quality, not teaching quality, a matter of being "red," not "expert." They say that physical health and teaching quality are also separate matters, claiming that teaching quality can only be measured in terms of professional knowledge. But facts speak louder than words. More than half a year of facts show that even the so-called professional knowledge has been greatly improved. The facts also demonstrate that their view of separating the inseparable whole of moral, intellectual, and physical education is absolutely wrong.

For those well-intentioned individuals who oppose or doubt the Party's education policy,道理是说不清的. Even if they are demonstrably wrong in the great debate on education policy, they are still only convinced on the surface. In their words: it makes sense in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because the day only has twenty-four hours for everyone. They always absolutely separate theory and practice when dealing with any problem. Our method is to guide them to practice and ask them to deal with the facts themselves. Therefore, in the year-end summary, we focused on several departments to conduct a major inspection of teaching quality. The method was to first conduct a debate, fully exposing all contradictions, and then organize those who have doubts about the education policy and those who firmly believe in it to conduct an investigation together. Some even asked teachers with doubts to personally conduct oral exams. During the investigation, we interviewed new and old teachers, visited alumni, and compared the current situation with the past in terms of teaching materials, experiments, and other aspects. Then, we analyzed each item based on the facts, and finally, we let the facts draw a conclusion. As a result, they bowed their heads before the truth. They had to admit that teaching quality had greatly improved after combining education with productive labor. It was not easy to get them to admit this, but their admission further demonstrates the great significance of the Party's education policy.

Take the Organic Chemistry course for third-year students in the Chemistry Department as an example. During the major debate on teaching quality inspection, some students insisted that teaching quality had not only not improved but had significantly decreased. When asked what they based their claims on, they said that they had only actually studied for two months in the semester, and the rest of the time was spent participating in productive labor and political movements. How could this not reduce teaching quality? When asked what problems the lower quality manifested, they said: less theory was learned; the scope of knowledge was narrowed; fewer experiments were conducted; engaging in productive labor and scientific research could not provide comprehensive knowledge. Despite presenting a large number of facts in the debate, they still thought that the facts people presented were unreliable. In their minds, these facts were completely unimaginable. So, we had to ask them to conduct their own investigation. Seven of them, along with twelve students who believed that the quality had greatly improved, visited nine teachers and fourteen fourth-year students who were one year ahead of them. They compared their situation with the fourth-year students' lectures, textbooks, extracurricular reading materials, experiments, instruments used, and scientific research. What was the result? What they thought was unreliable before the investigation turned out to be vivid facts. These facts were not even fully anticipated by those who were sure that the quality had improved before the investigation. Therefore, Cai Gan, the main speaker who previously thought that the quality had not improved, became the central speaker for promoting the significant improvement in teaching quality after the investigation.

Comprehensive universities mainly aim to cultivate talents in basic disciplines, so it is essential to learn basic theories well. Based on the examination of lectures and the results of interviews with students and teachers, the new lectures only lacked the "Yu Family Scholarship," which had been criticized and generally abandoned, but added the critique of the "Resonance Theory" and the "Valence Bond Theory" and "Organic Structure Theory." The "Valence Bond Theory" and "Organic Structure Theory" are fundamental theoretical issues that are very important for building a solid theoretical foundation. The profound critique of the "Resonance Theory" can initially establish a materialistic viewpoint for learning organic chemistry. This shows that compared to the past, theory has not been weakened but strengthened. The strengthening of theory is not only reflected in the quantity but also prominently in its close connection with production and practice. Students not only generally understand a few equations without reflecting conditions but can also apply the theory to production. It is self-evident which lecture quality is higher. If more theory is learned, then are fewer books read? This requires interviewing senior students and teachers. The results of the interviews also showed that not only were fewer books not read, but more were read. In addition to the lectures, they read Hückel's Organic Chemistry, Chichibabin's "Fundamental Principles of Organic Chemistry," Xing Qiyi's Organic Chemistry, "Dye Chemistry," "Intermediates and Dye Synthesis Principles," and professional magazines such as Chemistry Bulletin and Polymer Communications. Some students also consulted specialized literature such as Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Catalysis in Organic Chemistry, Nitration, and On Resonance Theory. In the past, fourth-year students generally only read Hückel's Organic Chemistry in addition to the lectures, and a few students browsed some Chemistry Bulletins. The results of the interviews with students were enough to illustrate the problem, but to further illustrate the problem, it was still necessary to interview teachers. The answers obtained after interviewing teachers were exactly as Mr. Xu Hansheng said: "According to the content you have learned, then specialization is not like specialization to you. If you want to open specialization in the future, you must greatly expand it." What about the experiment situation? Fourth-year students also answered them with facts. Fourth-year students told them that they did have six to eight hours of experiments every week in the past, but they only conducted nineteen experiments a year, and most of them used general instruments. In terms of mastering basic technical operations, because the purpose of the experiments was not clear in the past, the experiments were just done according to the procedures in the book. Some students used more medicine in order to pursue the quantity of products, so that the quantity of products reached 150% of the theoretical value. Therefore, although they also did some experiments, they did not get much really useful knowledge. Some even didn't know how to bend a glass tube. Now the situation after combining with productive labor has been greatly enriched. In the process of trial production of norepinephrine alone, they mastered many aspects of operating skills. No wonder fourth-year students would sigh to them: "We have done your past experimental techniques, but we have never done many of your operating techniques." No wonder the newly graduated teaching assistants sighed: "I only learned how to use the electric mixer you use a few weeks ago when I participated in the production of Cancerimide?" The knowledge gained in this way is of course enough to explain that it is more practical, more solid, and more comprehensive than what was learned in the past. The fourteen students they interviewed also told them during the interview that although they had done some experiments, because the operating techniques were not fully learned in the experiments, they used general instruments and did simple experiments, so they only remembered some experimental topics. As for which instruments and reagents were used in the experiments, they couldn't remember, let alone reflect on the reaction and side reaction process. However, the experiments done by the third-year students, because they implemented the policy of combining teaching and productive labor, some of the experimental processes became the process of trial production of new products. In this way, using theory to solve problems in production, and summarizing the production experience to theoretical principles through production summaries, not only consolidated the theory they had learned, but also obtained knowledge that could not be obtained from books. Whether what was learned in the past was comprehensive or what was learned after combining with productive labor was comprehensive can be said to be clear after a careful calculation.

The time for reading books has indeed been reduced, but the facts prove that the quality has indeed been improved. What is the mystery in this? There is no mystery, and the reason is very simple. It is because the Party's education policy has been resolutely implemented, so that political education, professional education, and labor education are combined, professional education, productive labor, and scientific research are combined, and the mass line of combining teachers and students under the leadership of the Party with capable people is specifically applied to teaching. The Party's leadership began to penetrate into all aspects and links of teaching, and Marxism-Leninism became the guiding ideology in the teaching process. In the study of professional courses, not only first explain to the students the importance of the course and its main content, so that students have a general understanding of the course, but also focus on introducing the latest achievements of the discipline and the new achievements of our country in the discipline, point out reference books to the students, and let the students give play to their creativity in learning; in productive labor and scientific research, the communist labor attitude and the correct direction of scientific research are emphasized. Through productive labor and scientific research, establish a global perspective, a collective perspective, a mass perspective, and a dialectical materialism perspective. On the one hand, constantly break superstitions and emancipate the mind, and on the other hand, advocate a scientific attitude and seek truth from facts. In this way, through productive labor and scientific research, not only the awareness is improved, but also the enthusiasm for learning professional theory is promoted. The power of Marxist-Leninist thought is infinite. Once the potential power in students' minds is illuminated by Marxist-Leninist thought, it will be fully exerted. They can reasonably arrange time, think independently, and collectively study problems. They are no longer passively dominated by time, but they want to actively dominate time. They are no longer passively dominated by books, but they want to actively dominate books. In this way, of course, they can read more books and read living books. However, after productive labor is included in the teaching plan, there is still a contradiction between reading and productive labor. At the beginning of implementing the Party's education policy, the main problem was only wanting to read and not wanting to work, but after labor started, there was also a phenomenon of not paying enough attention to reading. However, this problem was solved in the increasingly correct practice of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. This shows that education combined with productive labor is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and productive labor included in the teaching plan reflects the objective law of teaching. Facts show that people's awareness has been improved, politics has taken command, and professional learning has a soul. The style of study has changed, and the method of learning has also changed accordingly. Learning is no longer learning for learning's sake, or for theory's sake, but for the great cause of socialist construction. The method of learning is no longer rote memorization, and the time for learning is mainly used for independent thinking. Productive labor is becoming more and more interesting to them, and the learning of theory is becoming more and more urgent. If this cycle continues, books will inevitably be read more and more vividly. As for the enhancement of physical fitness, it will of course bring abundant energy to learning and directly affect learning. This proves that moral, intellectual, and physical education are a unity of opposites, which cannot be divided. Any attempt to separate the three is a metaphysical idea and will be criticized by objective things.

The above situation shows that the quality of education includes moral, intellectual, and physical education, and these three aspects are inseparable and mutually promote each other. The inevitable result of combining education with productive labor is a significant improvement in teaching quality. If it is said that the teaching quality has been greatly improved even in the case of more productive labor time in the last semester, then after a more reasonable arrangement of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research according to the instructions of the central government, the further improvement of teaching quality is of course beyond doubt. Even if some courses have not been significantly improved or even not improved in terms of professional knowledge alone, the great revolution of last year has undoubtedly laid the ideological and material foundation for the leap forward of these courses. Today's central issue is to correctly solve a series of new problems raised in the great revolution of education under the adherence to the Party's education policy, and through the correct answers to a series of problems, make our teaching quality a greater leap forward.

    教育结合生产劳动  提高了教学质量
    中共武汉大学委员会第一书记  刘仰峤
    教育结合生产劳动是不是会影响教学质量，这是在贯彻执行党的教育方针中争论的一个焦点，现在实践已经解决了这个问题。
    武汉大学半年多的实践证明：教育结合生产劳动的结果是大大提高了教学质量，将生产劳动列入教学计划，不仅有极其深刻的理论意义，而且有极其深刻的现实主义。
    反对、怀疑党的教育方针的人，在他们提出各种反对和怀疑的论据时，对于生产劳动列入教学计划后必然会促进学生的思想改造、增强体质似乎也是认为没有问题或问题不大的。不过他们把这些都看作和教学质量无关或关系不大，他们说思想觉悟是政治质量不是教学质量，是红的问题不是专的问题。身体健康和教学质量也是两回事情。他们说教学质量只能从专业知识方面去衡量。事实胜于雄辩。半年多的事实说明，他们所说的专业知识也是大大提高了，事实还说明他们将德育、智育、体育三者本来不可分割的整体分割开来的看法也是绝对错误的。
    对于反对和怀疑党的教育方针的好心人，不摆出事实，道理是说不清的。即使通过教育方针的大辩论，他们确实是理屈辞穷了，但他们还是口服心不服。用他们的说法是：理论上讲得通，实际上行不通，因为时间对每个人来讲，每昼夜都不会超过二十四小时。他们对待任何问题，总是将理论和实践绝对地分开。我们的办法就是把他们引向实践，请他们自己和事实去打交道。所以我们在年终总结时，以几个系为重点，展开了教学质量大检查。办法是先进行辩论，将所有的矛盾充分地加以揭露，然后将对教育方针有怀疑的人与坚信不移的人共同组织起来，进行调查；有的还请有怀疑的教师们亲自主持口试。调查的时候，采取访问新老教师，访问老同学，并就教材内容、实验等各个方面用过去和现在对比的结果逐项加以检查，然后根据事实逐项加以分析，最后要事实来做出结论。这样做的结果，使他们在真理面前低头了，他们不得不承认教育结合生产劳动后教学质量大大提高的事实。要他们承认这件事，是并不容易的，他们承认了也就更充分地说明了党的教育方针的伟大意义。
    以化学系三年级有机化学这门课程为例，在教学质量检查大辩论时，有些同学就硬说教学质量不但没有提高，而且是大大降低了。当问他们根据什么说质量没有提高而且大大降低时，他们就说一学期实际只学了两个月，其余的时间都参加了生产劳动和政治运动，这样怎么能不降低教学质量呢？再问他们质量低表现在些什么问题上呢？他们就说：理论学少了；知识领域缩小了；实验做少了；搞生产劳动和科学研究不能得到全面的知识。在辩论中尽管摆出大量的事实，然而他们也总还是以为人们所讲的事实，都不可靠，在他们想，这种事实是完全不可想像的。这样就只好请他们亲自进行调查了。他们一共七个同学和十二个认为质量大大提高的同学，一起访问了九位教师，十四位比他们高一年级的四年级的同学，将四年级的讲义、四年级同学所读过的课内课外参考书，四年级所进行过的实验和使用过的仪器以及科学研究的情况和他们的情况，一一做了对比，结果如何呢？他们在未调查以前认为是不可靠的东西，原来确是生动的事实，这种事实在未进行调查以前，是连认为质量肯定提高的人，也是没有完全想到的。所以过去认为质量没有提高的中心发言人蔡干同学，经过调查后，成为宣传教学质量大大提高的中心发言人了。
    综合大学主要是要培养基础学科方面的人材的，所以基本理论是必需学好才成，根据对讲义的检查和向同学、教师访问所得的结果表明：新讲义比原来的讲义只少了一个曾受批判、一般已被抛弃的“余家学术”，但却新增加了对“共振论”的批判和“价键理论”与“有机结构理论”。“价键理论”和“有机结构理论”都是根本的理论问题，对打好理论基础非常重要，对“共振论”的深刻批判，则可初步树立学习有机化学的唯物观点。这就说明两者相比不是削弱了理论，而是加强了理论。理论的加强还不仅限于量的方面，而突出地还表现于它是紧密地联系了生产，联系了实际。使学生不仅只是一般地了解几个没有反映条件的方程式就算了，而且可以将理论运用到生产上面。讲义质量究竟孰高孰低是不辩自明了。理论学多了，那末书是不是读少了呢？这就要访问高年级的同学和老师们了，访问的结果又说明了书不仅没有少读而是多读得多了，因为他们在这中间，除讲义外，成本的专业理论书籍除看了哈金斯基的有机化学外，还看了齐齐道宾的“有机化学基本原理”，邢其毅的有机化学，还有“染料化学”，“中间体及染料合成原理”，另外还看了专业杂志如化学通报、高分子通讯杂志，部分同学还查阅了一些专门文献，如药物化学，有机化学中的催化作用，硝化作用及论共振论等，而四年级的同学过去除讲义外，一般只读了一本哈金斯基的有机化学，少数同学翻阅了一些化学通报。在向同学访问的结果本来就足以说明问题了，不过为了更充分的说明问题，进一步访问教师还是必要的。访问教师以后得到的回答确如徐汉生先生所说：“按照你们所学过的内容，那末，现在的专门化对你们说来，就不像专门化了。将来要开专门化，就必须大大扩充了。”实验的情况又如何呢？四年级的同学也用事实回答了他们，四年级的同学告诉他们，过去每周确实有六小时至八小时的实验，但一年只搞十九个实验，而大部用的又都是一般的仪器，在掌握基本技术操作方面则由于过去实验的目的性不明确，实验时只是按书上的手续做做了事，有的同学为了追求产品数量，多用药，使产品数量达到理论值的150％，所以虽然也做了一些实验，但并未得到多少真正有用的知识，有的甚至连玻璃管都不会弯。现在和生产劳动结合后的情况就大大丰富了，仅在正肾上腺素的试制过程中，就掌握了多方面的操作技能，无怪四年级的同学会对他们感慨地说：“我们过去的实验技术你们都做了，但你们很多操作技术，我们就从未做过。”也无怪刚毕业的助教感慨地说：“你们用的电动搅拌器，我还是最近几个星期前参加癌得命生产时学会使用的呢？”这样所获得的知识当然也就足以说明比过去学的要实际得多，牢固得多，全面得多。他们访问过的十四位同学，在他们访问时还告诉他们说，他们虽然做过一些实验，但因为实验中操作技术学得不全面，用的都是一般的仪器，作的都是简单的实验，所以他们是只记得一些实验题目了，至于在实验中用过哪些仪器装置和药品都记不得了，更谈不上反映、副反映过程了。但三年级做的实验因为执行了教学和生产劳动结合的方针，一些实验的过程就成为试制新产品的过程，这样运用理论解决生产中的问题，通过生产总结，又将生产经验提到理论原则上加以概括，就不仅巩固了学过的理论，而且得到了书本上得不到的知识，究竟过去学的全面还是和生产劳动结合后全面，通过细细地算账可以说是算清楚了。
    读书的时间确实少了，质量事实证明确实高了，这中间究竟有什么神秘？神秘是没有的，道理也很简单。就是因为坚决贯彻执行了党的教育方针，使政治教育专业教育和劳动教育结合起来了，专业教育，生产劳动和科学研究结合起来了，党领导下的教师学生和能者相结合的群众路线具体运用到教学上面了。党的领导开始深入到教学的各个方面和各个环节，马克思列宁主义成为教学过程中的指导思想。在专业课程的学习中不仅首先向同学说明该课程的重要性和它的主要内容，使同学对该门课程有概括的了解，而且着重介绍该门学科最新成就，和我国在该门学科上的新成就，给学生指出参考书籍，让学生发挥学习上的创造性；在生产劳动中和科学研究中则强调了共产主义的劳动态度和科学研究的正确方向，通过生产劳动和科学研究树立全局观点、集体观点、群众观点、辩证唯物主义观点，一方面不断地破除迷信、解放思想，另一方面又提倡科学态度，实事求是，这样通过生产劳动和科学研究就不仅提高了觉悟，而且也推动学习专业理论的积极性。马克思列宁主义思想的威力是无穷的，学生思想上的潜在力量一经马克思列宁主义思想照耀就会充分的发挥出来，他们就可合理地安排时间，独立地进行思考，集体地研究问题，这就不再是被动地由时间支配他们，而是他们要主动地支配时间了，也就不再是被动地由书本支配他们，而是他们要主动地支配书本了。这样，当然就可以多读书，读活书。但是在生产劳动列入教学计划后，读书与生产劳动并不是没有矛盾的。在开始贯彻党的教育方针时主要是只愿读书，不愿劳动，但劳动上马后，也曾有过重视读书不够的现象。不过，教学、生产劳动和科学研究三者的结合愈来愈正确的实践过程中解决了这个问题。这就说明，教育结合生产劳动，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，生产劳动列入教学计划，反映了教学上的客观规律。事实说明，人们的觉悟提高了，政治挂了帅，专业学习有了灵魂。学风变了，学习的方法也就相应的变了。学习再不是为学习而学习，为理论而理论了，而是为社会主义建设的宏伟事业而学了。学习的办法再不是死记硬背了，学习的时间主要用于独立思考了。生产劳动对他们越来越有味了，对理论的学习也就越来越迫切了。这样循环往复的下去，书就必然读多了，读活了。至于体质的增强，当然是会给学习带来充沛的精力，直接对学习发生作用的。这就证明德育、智育、体育三者是对立的统一，是不容许分割的，任何想将三者割裂的想法，都是形而上学的，都将会为客观事物所批判。
    上述情况表明，教育质量是包括德育、智育、体育三个方面，这三个方面是不可分割的，是互相促进的，教育结合生产劳动的必然结果是大大提高了教学质量。如果说上学期生产劳动时间较多的情况下都大大提高了教学质量，那末在根据中央指示对教学、生产劳动与科学研究加以更合理的安排以后，教学质量的进一步提高当然更是确信无疑了，即使有某些课程单就专业知识看还没有显著提高或甚至没有提高，但通过去年一年的大革命，无疑的已为这些课程奠定了跃进的思想基础和物质基础。今天的中心问题是在坚持党的教育方针下，正确地解决教育大革命中提出来的一系列的新问题，通过一系列的问题的正确解答，使我们的教学质量来个更大的跃进。
