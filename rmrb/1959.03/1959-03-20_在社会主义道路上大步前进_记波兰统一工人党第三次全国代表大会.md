    Marching Forward on the Socialist Road
    ——A Record of the Third National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party
    By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing

    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sounded the clarion call for a great march toward communism. While the capitalist world is feeling panicked and anxious about this magnificent advance, the Polish United Workers' Party has convened its Third National Congress. This is not only a major event for the Polish people, but also for the entire socialist camp.

    The Congress had more than 1,400 delegates, coming from the Baltic coast, from the rural areas at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains... They included former members of the Polish Communist Party, warriors of the former People's Guard, underground workers during the Nazi occupation, outstanding laborers, and famous political activists. They gathered in the magnificent conference hall of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw to review the arduous road and great achievements Poland has made in recent years, and to accelerate the pace of marching towards socialism.

    During the days of the Party Congress, the Polish people were immersed in an atmosphere of production upsurge and political enthusiasm.

    Before the opening of the Congress, factories and enterprises discussed the draft directive on the development of the national economy for 1959-1965 proposed by the 12th Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, and launched a production increase campaign to welcome the "Third Congress." Four hundred thousand young people alone participated in this tribute movement. So far, many units and individuals have completed their production increase pledges. The Polish working class is realizing the country's seven-year plan with unparalleled production enthusiasm. Workers at the Paris Commune Shipyard decided to triple production and increase labor efficiency by 80% in seven years. They also plan to explore more potential and build eleven more ships.

    Such production enthusiasm is inspired by the brilliant prospects of Poland's seven-year development plan. By 1965, Poland's industrial production will increase by 80% compared to 1958, and the per capita output of important products will exceed Italy and catch up with or exceed the current level of France. Agriculture will grow by 30% in seven years, and the per capita output of meat, milk and sugar will exceed the current levels of France and West Germany. The Polish people hope to use their hard work to bring this day sooner, and many factories and enterprises have pledged to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. More than thirty factories in Lublin Province have responded to the call to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule.

    Now, while stepping up production, the employees of various factories and enterprises are paying close attention to the progress of the Party Congress. They have already begun to read or discuss Comrade Gomulka's report and other documents related to the Congress.

    The atmosphere in the Congress hall was one of unity, harmony, tension, and enthusiasm. Whether during corridor breaks or in the hall while waiting for the meeting to begin, the delegates were talking enthusiastically and arguing seriously. They only had one topic – how to build socialism faster.

    One by one, the delegates stepped onto the solemn podium to report to the Party Central Committee and the representatives of all Party members on the achievements and shortcomings of their departments and their plans for the future. They pledged to obey the leadership of the Party Central Committee, to implement the resolutions of the Congress, and their speeches showed a style of serious self-examination and sharp criticism, demonstrating the style of democratic life within the Party.

    Revisionism was severely condemned at this Congress. Many delegates pointed out in their speeches that revisionists undermine Party unity and the principles of Marxism-Leninism. They all believed that revisionism is the main danger at present and that the resolute struggle against it must continue. Through the enthusiastic discussions of this Congress, the ideological understanding within the Party was further unified, and the Party's unity was further consolidated. This encouraging atmosphere can be clearly seen from the delegates' speeches. They all agreed with the reports made by Comrade Gomulka and others, and expressed their determination to implement the resolutions of the Congress.

    The unanimous call of the Congress was to demand that the Party strengthen its political and ideological work among the masses. The delegates were particularly concerned about the education of the younger generation. Revisionists and reactionary clerics spread anarchism, anti-Party sentiments and various bourgeois ideas among young people, trying to separate Polish youth from the leadership of the Party and the socialist road. Party organizations and the Socialist Youth League have taken some measures to clarify the ideological confusion among young people. Many delegates spoke at the Congress, calling for continued strengthening of political and ideological education for young people, and political economy and philosophy courses should be set up in universities. In addition, Party organizations should be concerned about the work of the Youth League, and the Youth League should formulate plans to educate young people.

    The construction of the western region of Poland was also one of the important issues addressed by the Congress. This region was recovered from Nazi Germany after World War II and suffered severe damage during the war. Although West German militarists do not recognize the Oder-Neisse border, the people of the western region believe that Poland's armed forces, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, can repel any invasion of this sacred border. They have great confidence in the socialist construction of their region. The state also pays great attention to the development of this region.

    The despicable acts of the imperialists and their lackeys, the Yugoslav revisionist group, to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and alienate Poland from the Soviet Union, have been unanimously countered by the socialist countries. The Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party gave these enemies of socialism another resounding slap in the face. Comrade Gomulka said in his report: "The unity of the socialist camp based on the principles of proletarian internationalism has forever laid the political foundation of our Party." He also said: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the main force in the international communist movement. The Soviet Union is the pillar of the international communist movement and the pillar of all socialist countries." Ignatov, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who was invited to attend the Congress, expressed the most sincere friendship to the Polish Party and people in his congratulatory speech to the Congress. In the speeches of the delegates, they repeatedly mentioned the selfless assistance and support given to the Polish people by socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. They all expressed their determination to further strengthen unity and friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    Delegations from fraternal parties from forty-four countries were invited to attend the Congress. Their congratulatory messages to the Congress were full of the spirit of proletarian internationalist unity and friendship. They all emphasized the importance of international unity and the great significance of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They regarded the achievements of the Polish people in socialist construction as a contribution to the socialist camp and world peace. They were happy for these achievements.

    The Third National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party has closed. A seven-year construction program that embodies the will of the Polish people has been born. This program is a symbol of the further unity of the Polish United Workers' Party, and a symbol of Poland's great strides forward on the socialist road. The Polish people believe in what Comrade Gomulka said: In a historically short period of time, socialism will achieve a complete and total victory in Poland.

    在社会主义道路上大步前进
    ——记波兰统一工人党第三次全国代表大会
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会吹起了向共产主义大进军的号角。当资本主义世界正对这一气势豪壮的进军感到惊慌忧虑的时候，波兰统一工人党又召开了第三次全国代表大会。这不仅是波兰人民的大事，也是整个社会主义阵营的大事。
    代表大会有一千四百多名代表，他们来自波罗的海海滨，来自喀尔巴阡山麓的农村，……他们之中包括前波兰共产党党员、前人民近卫军的勇士、纳粹占领时的地下工作人员、优秀的劳动者和著名的政治活动家。他们聚集在华沙文化科学宫华丽的会议厅中，是为了回顾波兰在最近几年来所走过的艰苦道路和巨大成就，加速向社会主义迈进的步伐。
    在党代表大会进行的这些日子中，波兰全国人民沉浸在生产高潮和政治热情的气氛中。
    在代表大会开幕前，各工厂企业都讨论了党的十二中全会提出的1959—1965年国民经济发展指示草案，并且展开了迎接“三大”的增产运动。单是参加这个献礼运动的青年就有四十万人。到现在为止，已有许多单位和个人完成了他们的增产保证。波兰工人阶级正以无比高涨的生产热情，来实现国家的七年计划。巴黎公社造船厂的工人决定在七年中使生产增长三倍，提高劳动效率80％。还准备再发掘潜力，多造十一只船。
    这样的生产劲头是为波兰七年发展计划的灿烂前景所鼓舞的。到1965年，波兰的工业生产将比1958年增长80％，按人口平均的重要产品的产量将超过意大利，赶上或超过法国目前的水平。七年中农业将增长30％，按人口平均的肉类、牛奶和砂糖产量将超过法国和西德目前的水平。波兰人民都希望用自己的辛勤劳动促使这一天早日到来，许多工厂企业都保证提前完成七年计划。卢布林省已有三十多个工厂响应提前完成七年计划的号召。
    现在各工厂企业的职工一面加紧生产，一面密切注意着党代表大会的进行情况。他们都已经开始阅读或讨论哥穆尔卡同志的报告和其他有关代表大会的文件。
    在代表大会的会场内，充满着团结、和谐、紧张、热烈的气氛。代表们不论是在走廊休息时或是在大厅内等候开会前的片刻，都在热情地交谈，严肃地争论。他们的话题只有一个——怎样更快地建设社会主义。
    发言的代表一个个走上严肃的讲台，向自己的党中央和全体党员的代表汇报自己部门的工作成绩和缺点以及今后的计划。他们保证服从党中央的领导，保证执行代表大会的决议，在他们的发言中有认真的自我检查，也有尖锐的批评，表现出党内民主生活的作风。
    修正主义在这次代表大会上遭到了严厉的谴责。许多代表在发言时都指责修正主义分子破坏党内团结、破坏马列主义原则，他们都认为修正主义是目前的主要危险，必须同它继续进行坚决的斗争。通过这次代表大会的热烈讨论，进一步统一了党内的思想认识，党的团结更加巩固了。从代表们的发言中就可以明显地看出这种令人鼓舞的气象。他们都同意哥穆尔卡等同志所作的报告，并表示将坚决实现大会决议。
    要求党加强对群众的政治思想工作，是代表大会的一致呼声。代表们特别关怀对青年一代的教育。修正主义者和反动教徒在青年中散布无政府主义、反党情绪和形形色色的资产阶级思想，他们想使波兰青年脱离党的领导和社会主义道路。党组织和社会主义青年联盟对澄清青年中的思想混乱现象已经采取了一些措施。许多代表在大会上发言时，都要求继续加强对青年的政治思想教育，应该在大学中设置政治经济学和哲学课程。此外党组织应该关心青年联盟的工作，青年联盟应该制定教育青年的计划。
    波兰西部地区的建设工作，也是大会注意的重要问题之一。这个地区是在第二次世界大战后从纳粹德国手中收回的，在战争中受到了严重的破坏，尽管西德军国主义者不承认奥得—尼斯河边界，但是，西部地区人民相信波兰的武装力量能在苏联和整个社会主义阵营的协助下击退对这个神圣边界的任何侵犯。他们对自己地区的社会主义建设有很大信心。国家对这个地区的发展也非常注意。
    帝国主义者及其仆从南斯拉夫修正主义集团企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结、离间波兰同苏联的友谊这种卑劣行径，已遭到社会主义国家的一致反击，波兰统一工人党的这次代表大会，又给了这些社会主义的敌人一记响亮的耳光，哥穆尔卡同志在他的报告中说：“无产阶级国际主义原则的社会主义阵营的团结一致永远奠定了我们党的政治基础”。他又说：“苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动中的主要力量。苏联是国际共产主义运动的支柱，是所有社会主义国家的支柱。”应邀来参加大会的苏联共产党代表团团长伊格纳托夫在向大会致祝词时，向波兰党和人民表达了最为诚挚的友情。在代表们的发言中，也一再提到社会主义国家特别是苏联给予波兰人民的无私的援助和支持。他们都表示要进一步加强同苏联和其他社会主义国家的团结和友谊。
    被邀请前来参加代表大会的有四十四个国家的兄弟党代表团。在他们向大会所作的祝词中，充满着无产阶级国际主义团结友爱的精神。他们都一致强调国际团结的重要性和苏共二十一次代表大会的伟大意义。他们把波兰人民在社会主义建设中所获得的成就看作是对社会主义阵营和世界和平的贡献。他们为这些成就感到高兴。
    波兰统一工人党第三次全国代表大会已经闭幕了。一部集中着波兰全国人民意志的七年建设纲领诞生了。这个纲领是波兰统一工人党进一步团结的标志，是波兰在社会主义道路上大步前进的标志。波兰人民都相信哥穆尔卡同志所说的一句话：在历史上不长的时期内，社会主义将在波兰取得彻底的和完全的胜利。
