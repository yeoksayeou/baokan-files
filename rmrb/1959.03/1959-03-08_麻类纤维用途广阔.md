Bast fibers play a very important role in the production of daily necessities, whether in the past, present, or future. Our ancestors first used bast and silk textiles to replace leaves and animal skins for clothing. China is a country with abundant bast fiber resources, producing all kinds of bast fibers in the world. In the warm and humid areas of the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, a large amount of jute and ramie grow, while hemp is distributed in all provinces of the country. Kenaf is abundant in the vast North China and Songliao Plain. In tropical and subtropical areas such as Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan Island, sisal and Manila hemp are produced. Flax grows along the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River. A large amount of Apocynum venetum grows in the wastelands of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces.

In the past, people knew that bast was a raw material for making ropes, sacks, fishing nets, linen, and paper. However, now the function of bast has far exceeded these. With the leap forward in industry, the use of bast is becoming wider and wider.

Bast fiber is the raw material for weaving sacks. Most of the commonly seen sacks are made of jute, and some are made of kenaf. The biggest advantage of jute sacks is that the fiber has strong hygroscopicity and is not easy to lint. It is used to package industrial and agricultural products such as sugar, salt, rice, and wool. On the one hand, it can keep the products dry and prevent mildew. At the same time, it will not fall off broken fibers, keeping the products clean and beautiful. The quality of kenaf sacks is not as good as jute and kenaf, but the raw materials are abundant and the price is low. Before liberation, most of the sacks used in our country were imported from foreign countries. After liberation, since 1952, our country has produced its own sacks, not only achieving self-sufficiency, but also being able to export them. With the rapid development of China's construction, the allocation of materials is frequent. In 1959 alone, the demand for sacks and burlap is estimated to be about 14.6 million dan, which is equivalent to more than twice the total output of jute in 1958.

Most of the ropes used in our country are also made of bast fiber. Generally, ropes are mostly made of jute, kenaf, and hemp. Ropes are widely used and are in great demand. Each rope traction machine requires seventy to eighty catties of bast.

Bast fiber is also a good textile raw material. Jute can be blended with ramie, flax, and cotton to form beautiful fabrics, curtains, tablecloths, and sofa fabrics, which are durable and beautiful. Ramie can be woven into our country's specialty Xia cloth. The strength and fineness of Apocynum venetum fiber exceed that of wool in the Northwest.

Bast is also an important raw material in the construction industry. A layer of jute is often laid on the top floor of a building, which can replace asphalt felt and play a waterproof role. Bast wadding and bast shavings, collectively known as bast knives in the north, are good materials for plastering walls after being mixed with lime. The use of bast in the construction industry is more than just these. The towering wooden frame for building houses is bundled with bast.

The relationship between bast fiber and fishery production and industrial production is also very close. Ropes and nets used in fishery production are inseparable from bast. Ramie can also be used to manufacture conveyor belts, water hoses, tire linings, and wire wrapping cloths for machines.

Various tropical and subtropical bast fibers produced in abundance in southern China are not afraid of seawater corrosion and are good raw materials for manufacturing ropes on warships, and can also be used to manufacture cables for mines, oil wells, and factories.

    麻类纤维用途广阔
    刘运道
    麻，无论在过去，现在和将来，都扮演着生产生活必需品中一个十分重要的角色。我们的祖先用来代替树叶兽皮作衣物的首先是麻和丝的纺织品。我国是麻类资源很丰富的国家，盛产着世界上各种的麻类。在长江珠江流域的温暖多湿地区生长着大量的黄麻和苎麻，大麻则分布在全国各省，在辽阔的华北、松辽平原上又盛产?麻（青麻），在广东、福建、海南岛等热带、亚热带地区，出产着龙舌兰麻和蕉麻。在松花江和黑龙江畔生长着亚麻。在新疆、甘肃、陕西等省的荒地上生长着大量的罗布麻。
    过去，人们都知道麻是制造麻绳、麻袋、渔网、麻布和造纸的原料。但是，现在麻的功能却远远超过了这些，随着工业的跃进，麻的用途越来越宽广了。
    麻纤维是织麻袋的原料。日常最容易见到的麻袋，绝大部分是黄麻织成的，部分是洋麻、?麻织成的。黄麻麻袋最大的优点是纤维的吸湿性强，不易起毛，用来包装糖、盐、大米、羊毛等工农业产品，一方面可以保持产品的干燥，不致霉烂，同时不会脱落碎的纤维，保持产品的清洁美观。?麻织成的麻袋，质量虽不如黄麻、洋麻好，但原料多，价格低廉。在解放前，我国所用的麻袋大部是从国外进口的。解放后，从1952年开始我国自己生产的麻袋，不仅做到自给，而且还能出口。随着我国建设事业的飞跃发展，物资调拨频繁，1959年仅麻袋和麻包布一项预计即需麻一千四百六十万担左右，相当于1958年黄麻总产量的二倍以上。
    我国使用的绳索，多数也是麻纤维制成的。一般绳索多是用黄麻、洋麻、大麻制成的。绳索的用途广，需要量也很大。每台绳索牵引机就需麻七、八十斤。
    麻纤维也是很好的纺织原料。黄麻可以和苎麻、亚麻、棉花混纺成优美的布匹、窗帘、桌布、沙发布，既经久耐用又美观。苎麻可以织成我国的特产夏布。罗布麻纤维的强度和细度都超过西北的羊毛。
    麻在建筑业上也是一项重要的原料。在大楼的最顶层常常要铺一层黄麻，可以代替油毛毡起到防水的作用。麻绒、麻屑在北方统称为麻刀，与石灰混合后，是抹墙壁的良好材料。在建筑业上的用途还不止这些。建筑房屋的矗入云霄的木架就是用麻捆缚的。
    麻纤维和渔业生产、工业生产的关系也很密切。渔业生产上用的绳索、网都离不开麻。苎麻还可以制造机器上的传送带、水龙带、轮胎的里布，电线包布等。
    我国南方盛产的各种热带麻和亚热带麻，不怕海水腐蚀，是制造军舰上绳索的良好原料，也可用于制造矿山、油井、工厂用的缆索。
