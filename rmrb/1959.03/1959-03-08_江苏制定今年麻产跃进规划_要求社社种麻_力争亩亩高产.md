Jiangsu Formulates This Year's Leap Forward Plan for Hemp Production
Requiring Every Commune to Plant Hemp and Striving for High Yields Per Mu

This newspaper reports that Jiangsu Province has formulated a plan for hemp production this year. The planting area will increase from more than 420,000 mu in 1958 to 1.4 million mu. The planned total output is 6.1 million dan, striving for 10 million dan. The goal is to achieve basic self-sufficiency in hemp within one year and a surplus within two years for the entire province.

Jiangsu Province has many types of hemp, and hemp can be planted everywhere. Last year, many high-yield examples emerged in various places, indicating the great potential for increasing hemp production. The Zhuhu People's Commune in Sihong County planted 1,750 mu of jute for the first time, and the single-mu yield reached 1,000 jin, more than three times the general yield. The Dama single-mu yield of the Tiefo Temple People's Commune in Pi County was 953 jin, more than four times the general yield. After summarizing these high-yield experiences, various places are full of confidence in striving for high yields per mu of hemp crops this year.

With the development of various undertakings and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, coupled with the large-scale promotion of rope traction machines in rural areas, the demand for hemp has greatly increased. It is estimated that the province's agricultural hemp needs are 3 million dan this year, the agricultural products and other materials packaging hemp needs are 5 million dan, and the transportation industry, fishery, and handicraft industry hemp needs are 2 million dan. In order to ensure that every commune plants hemp and achieves high yields per mu, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has put forward several specific requirements to special districts, cities, and counties: (1) Plant according to local conditions, rationally utilize land, and formulate hemp production plans at all levels. Make reasonable layouts based on the growth characteristics of various hemp types and local conditions. Each special district, county, and city should make unified plans and arrangements according to needs. The county plans down to the commune, and the commune plans down to the field. (2) Prepare early. This year, the newly expanded hemp field area is large, and the density is increased. Seeds must be allocated as early as possible, relying on mutual support from the masses. Plant whatever hemp seeds are available. (3) Improve cultivation techniques. Grasp the main key to hemp production and strive for early planting. (4) Strengthen leadership and professional management. Hemp production, like other production, should have someone in charge of management in the special district and county. People's communes must not only have full-time cadres to lead, but also have professional teams responsible for hemp fields.

    江苏制定今年麻产跃进规划
    要求社社种麻　力争亩亩高产
    本报讯　江苏省已作出今年麻类生产的规划。播种面积将由1958年的四十二万多亩增加到一百四十万亩。计划总产量六百一十万担，争取一千万担。争取全省用麻一年基本自给，二年自给有余。
    江苏省麻的种类多，到处可以种麻。去年各地出现了不少高产事例，说明麻类的增产潜力很大。泗洪县朱湖人民公社第一年种黄麻一千七百五十亩，单产就达到一千斤，高于一般产量三倍多。邳县铁佛寺人民公社大麻单产九百五十三斤，比一般产量高四倍多。各地总结了这些高产经验后，对今年争取麻类作物亩亩高产充满了信心。
    随着各项事业的发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，加上农村大量推行绳索牵引机，麻的需要量大大增加。据推算，今年全省农业用麻需三百万担，农业产品及其他物资包装用麻需五百万担，交通运输业、渔业、手工业用麻需二百万担。江苏省农林部门为了保证社社种麻，亩亩高产，已向各专区、市、县提出了几项具体要求：（1）因地种植，合理利用土地，层层制订麻类生产规划。根据各种麻类生长特性和各地具体条件合理布局。各专区、县、市根据需要，统一规划，统一安排。县规划到社，社规划到田。（2）及早做好准备工作。今年新扩麻田面积大，密度增加，种籽要及早调配，依靠群众互相支援，有什么麻种，种什么麻。
  （3）提高栽培技术。抓住麻类生产主要关键，力争早播。（4）加强领导，专业专管。麻类生产同其他生产一样，专区、县有人分工掌握管理。人民公社既要有专职干部领导，麻田又要有专业队负责。
