    Good Films Should Also Be Re-Released Repeatedly
    In the "Cultural Street Corner" column on page 8 of the People's Daily on February 21, the issue of performing "repertory pieces" was discussed. I believe that it is not only necessary to perform "repertory pieces" in theaters, but it is also very meaningful to repeatedly screen good films in various cinemas.
    Currently, some cinemas generally screen new films for a week to ten days, after which these films are never seen again. New films are often like a gust of wind that passes by, and new films become old films, and they also become "outdated." This approach is inappropriate.
    Film is the most powerful educational tool. Good films are not only enjoyable to watch repeatedly, but each viewing is also enlightening. Take the film "The White Haired Girl" as an example. Each viewing deepens the audience's hatred for the old society and their love for the new society; many excellent documentaries are the same. Therefore, it is a very necessary and meaningful task for relevant departments to pay attention to organizing cinemas to repeatedly screen good films.

### 好影片也应反复上映

    好影片也应反复上映
    人民日报2月21日第八版的“文化街头”栏里，谈了上演“保留剧目”的问题。我以为不仅在剧院里上演“保留剧目”很有必要，在各个电影院反复放映好影片，也是极有意义的。
    目前有些影院放映新片时间一般是一周至十天，以后这些影片就再也不见上映了。上映的新片经常像刮一阵风似的过去了，新片成了老片子，也就随着“过时”了。这种做法是不妥当的。
    电影是最有力的教育工具。好的影片不但使人百看不厌，而且每看一次，对于人都有所启发。就拿影片“白毛女”来说，每看一遍都加深了观众对旧社会的痛恨和对新社会的热爱；好多优秀的纪录片也一样。因此，有关部门注意组织影院反复放映好影片，是一项很必要的、有意义的工作。
