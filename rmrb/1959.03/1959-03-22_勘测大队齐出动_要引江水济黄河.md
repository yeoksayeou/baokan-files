    Survey Teams Mobilized to Divert Yangtze Water to Aid Yellow River
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 20th. Large-scale survey and reconnaissance work to allow China's largest sister rivers—the Yangtze and the Yellow River—to join hands, and to find a water supply route for the water-deficient western regions and the Yellow River, has recently begun.
    This large-scale reconnaissance and survey work is being carried out by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in conjunction with relevant departments in the western provinces and regions, in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is focusing on surveying water diversion routes and river channels; the Chinese Academy of Sciences is mainly conducting comprehensive scientific investigations. The survey and reconnaissance team is very large. Currently, the advance troops of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission participating in this survey work have gone to Sichuan, Qinghai, and other provinces and regions to discuss the development of survey work with relevant departments; various survey teams are also adjusting their organization, equipping themselves with equipment and materials, and purchasing living supplies suitable for high mountains and grasslands, and are about to set off to work separately. All reconnaissance and survey work will be completed in the third quarter of this year.
    According to the development plan of China's socialist construction, the existing water volume of the Yellow River is far from meeting the needs of large-scale development of industrial and agricultural production in the areas along the river, while the Yangtze River has abundant water volume. In order to find a route to divert the Yangtze River to aid the Yellow River, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission sent reconnaissance teams to Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces and regions last year to conduct reconnaissance. The focus of this reconnaissance and survey work is to survey several water diversion routes with relatively large advantages proposed in last year's reconnaissance. In addition, the northwestern provinces and regions will also conduct reconnaissance of water transmission lines related to these water diversion lines.

### 勘测大队齐出动  要引江水济黄河

    勘测大队齐出动
    要引江水济黄河
    新华社郑州20日电　让我国最大的姊妹河流——长江和黄河携手，为缺水的西部地区和黄河寻找补水线路的引江济黄大规模勘测、查勘工作已经在最近开始。
    这次大规模的查勘和勘测工作，是黄河水利委员会会同西部各省区有关部门，配合中国科学院进行的。黄河水利委员会着重进行引水线路和河道的勘测；中国科学院主要是搞科学的综合考察。这项查勘、勘测的队伍很大。现在，黄河水利委员会参加这项勘测工作的先头部队，已经分别前往四川、青海等省区，和有关部门共同商量开展勘测工作；各个勘测队伍，也正在调整组织，装备器材，购置适应高山、草原地区的生活用品，即将分头出发工作。全部查勘、勘测工作将在今年第三季度完成。
    根据我国社会主义建设发展的规划看来，黄河现有的水量远不能满足沿河两岸地区工农业生产大发展的需要，而长江却有充沛的水量。为寻找引江济黄的线路，去年，黄河水利委员会就派出查勘队伍，在四川、青海、甘肃等省区进行了查勘。这次查勘、勘测工作的重点是，勘测去年查勘提出的优越性比较大的几条引水线路。此外，西北各省区也要进行和这些引水线路有关的输水线路查勘。
