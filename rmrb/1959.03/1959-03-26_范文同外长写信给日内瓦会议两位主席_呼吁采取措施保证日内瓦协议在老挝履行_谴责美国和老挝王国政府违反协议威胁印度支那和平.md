Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 25th: The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon a letter from Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, dated March 4th. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellencies, the Chairmen:

Further to my letter of February 4, 1959, to Your Excellencies, please allow me to draw your attention to the alarming developments in the current situation in Laos.

Violations of the provisions of the Geneva Agreements on Laos have not only not been stopped, but continue to occur more seriously. Acts of terror, reprisal, and discrimination against former resistance members in Laos continue unabated. U.S. imperialism continues to send military personnel and new weapons into Laos. The Royal Lao Government continues to encroach on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Following the letter from the two chairmen to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos and the Indian government on January 31, 1959, the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Phoui Sananikone, issued a statement on February 11, 1959, stating: The work of implementing the Geneva Agreements on Laos has been completed, and the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos has no relation to the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam. Regarding the existence and activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone declared: Laos is a member of the United Nations and cannot accept the arbitration of any international organization outside the United Nations.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam considers that the recent actions of the Royal Lao Government and the statement of Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone of the Royal Lao Government on February 11, 1959, are of a very serious nature and violate Articles 6, 7, 9, 15, and 39 of the Geneva Agreement "Decision on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" and paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Agreement. These agreements have no connection with the United Nations. These actions of the Royal Lao Government are undoubtedly a conspiracy to undermine the continued implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, obstruct the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, create opportunities for U.S. imperialism to further invade Laos, turn Laos into a U.S. military base, and subsequently pave the way for dragging Laos into the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. These actions are against the interests of the Lao people and against the interests of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

In the context of the United States' increasingly intensified invasion of Laos and serious violations of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, requests the two chairmen to take appropriate measures to meet the requirements of the situation, first and foremost to enable the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos to continue its activities, ensure the full implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and contribute to maintaining peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Mr. Chairman, please accept my highest respects.

Pham Van Dong
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    范文同外长写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
    呼吁采取措施保证日内瓦协议在老挝履行
    谴责美国和老挝王国政府违反协议威胁印度支那和平
    新华社河内25日电　越南外交部今天下午发表越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在3月4日寄给1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席的一封信。全文如下：两位主席：
    继1959年2月4日我寄给两位主席一封信以后，请允许我提请阁下注意当前老挝局势令人担心的发展。
    违反老挝日内瓦协议条款的事件不仅未能制止，而且仍然继续更加严重地发生。对老挝前抗战人员的恐怖、报复和歧视的行动仍然在不断地进行。美帝国主义不断对老挝增派军事人员和运入新式武器。老挝王国政府仍然继续侵犯越南民主共和国的领土。
    1959年1月31日两位主席致函老挝国际监督和监察委员会和印度政府以后，老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空在1959年2月11日发表声明说：履行老挝日内瓦协议的工作已经完成，老挝日内瓦协议的履行和越南日内瓦协议的履行是没有关系的。对老挝国际监督和监察委员会的存在和活动，培·萨纳尼空首相宣布说：老挝是联合国的会员国，不能接受联合国以外的任何国际组织的仲裁。
    越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝王国政府近来的行动和1959年2月11日老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空的声明具有很严重的性质，是违反日内瓦协议“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的决定”第六、第七、第九、第十五和第三十九条和日内瓦协议最后宣言第四和第五段。这些协议同联合国是毫无关连的。老挝王国政府的这些行动，无疑是阴谋破坏老挝日内瓦协议的继续履行，阻挠老挝国际监督和监察委员会的活动，为美帝国主义更进一步侵入老挝制造机会，把老挝变成美国的军事基地，并且随后为把老挝拉入东南亚军事侵略集团铺平道路。这些行动是违反老挝人民的利益，违反印度支那和东南亚的和平的利益的。
    在美国日益加紧对老挝的侵入和老挝日内瓦协议遭受严重违反的情况下，越南民主共和国政府作为老挝日内瓦协议签订的一方，要求两位主席采取适当的措施以适应形势的要求，首先是使老挝国际监督和监察委员会继续活动，保证老挝日内瓦协议的充分履行，为维护印度支那和东南亚的和平作出贡献。
    主席先生，请接受我最崇高的敬意。
          越南民主共和国外交部长　范文同
