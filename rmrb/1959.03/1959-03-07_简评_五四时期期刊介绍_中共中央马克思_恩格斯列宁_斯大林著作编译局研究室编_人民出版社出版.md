    A Brief Review of "Introduction to Periodicals of the May Fourth Period"
    Edited by the Research Office of the Compilation Bureau of Works by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee, Published by People's Publishing House
    Peng Ming
    The newly published "Introduction to Periodicals of the May Fourth Period" (First Collection) is a good book, an important reference book for studying modern Chinese history, intellectual history, and the history of newspapers and periodicals.
    This book is a collection of materials, and also a work with scientific research properties. The editing method of this book is different from that of general material collections. It is not just a collection of original materials, but also includes a considerable amount of space (about half of the book) for commenting on the original materials. In the commentary, the editors researched a large amount of original materials and put forward their own views on many issues. For example, in the introduction to "New Youth" magazine, the editors analyzed its three stages, pointed out the characteristics of each stage, and from the research of some representative figures and representative works, pointed out the formation and division of the cultural united front at that time. For example, in the introduction to the "Morning News Supplement," in addition to generally discussing the nature of the Morning News and the Morning News Supplement during the May Fourth Period, the editors also introduced the articles published by Comrade Li Dazhao in this newspaper and the works and theories of various schools of socialism published in the newspaper, as well as the reflection of the Russian October Revolution in China. In these introductions, the editors gave evaluations, especially analyzing and criticizing the fallacies of various non-Marxist "socialist" schools. For example, in the introduction to "The Weekly Review," the editors revealed the purpose of Dai Jitao and others' talk about socialism at that time through the analysis of specific materials, and after summarizing the domestic and foreign political and economic propositions published in "The Weekly Review," pointed out that "it reflects the interests, demands and illusions of the Chinese national bourgeoisie." At the same time, the editors also pointed out through the analysis of a large number of materials the objective role that this publication played in promoting the dissemination of Marxism at that time.
    In addition to the commentary on the periodicals, the book appends the inaugural speeches and declarations of relevant publications in the other half of the space, as well as the catalogs of various publications, which provide original materials and clues for further research.
    The above-mentioned method and form of editing materials books brings many conveniences to people when reading and using this book.
    This book not only has advantages in its editing method and form, but also has rich content. In this collection alone, the following twenty-one publications are introduced: "New Youth," "Weekly Review," "The National," "New Tide," "Morning News Supplement," "Xiang River Review," "Correspondence Collection of New People's Study Society Members," "Weekly Review," "Awakening" (Supplement of Shanghai Republican Daily), "Construction," "Young China," "Young World," "Sunday," "Young Society," "New Life," "Dawn," "New Society," "Humanity," "Awakening," "People's Education" and "Liberation and Reconstruction." Among these publications, many are rare and valuable materials. Through the observation of the above various publications, we can have a comprehensive understanding of the ideological trends during the May Fourth Period; at the same time, we can have a relatively deep understanding of the leading role played by intellectuals with preliminary communist ideas in this movement.
    Recently, the historical circles have become more interested in the study of modern and contemporary Chinese history, and the number of personnel has also increased. However, people generally feel the difficulty of the lack of materials. Therefore, they request relevant departments to edit and publish some systematic reference materials related to modern Chinese history. The publication of "Introduction to Periodicals of the May Fourth Period" can begin to meet some of their requirements. If in the future every historical period has such several or even dozens of special reference materials published, it will greatly promote the development of modern Chinese history research work. At the same time, this work should not only rely on some relevant agencies in Beijing to do, but also give play to the enthusiasm of local areas; the modern Chinese history teachers and researchers in various places can edit a certain number of special reference materials according to the characteristics and capabilities of each place. In this way, division of labor and cooperation, mutual exchange, will receive greater results.
    There are still some issues in the commentary and evaluation of some issues in this book that can be discussed. Here, I would like to raise the following questions and talk about some of my views.
    For example, regarding the nature of the Research Clique, the editors only judged it as "a political group of bourgeois reformists" (page 352), without pointing out its feudal compradore nature, which is not comprehensive enough.
    The Research Clique was a group of politicians formed in 1916. After the formation of the Research Clique, it relied on Duan Qirui domestically and colluded with Japanese imperialism abroad. During World War I, Duan Qirui, instigated by Japanese imperialism, advocated declaring war on Germany, and Liang Qichao echoed him in his capacity as an opposition figure. In July 1917, Duan Qirui reorganized the cabinet, and there were six members of the Research Clique in the new cabinet. Liang Qichao once served as Minister of Finance. After that, the Research Clique lost power, but in the Anfu National Assembly in 1918, there were still more than 20 members of the Research Clique. The leader of the Research Clique, Liang Qichao, once appeared on the political stage as a representative of bourgeois reformists during the Hundred Days' Reform Movement and played a certain degree of progressive role. However, since then, Liang Qichao, like Kang Youwei, began to degenerate politically and gradually moved towards reaction.
    As for why the members of the Research Clique also talked about their "socialism" during the May Fourth Movement, there is only one explanation, that is, when the Marxist propaganda movement had rapidly unfolded and had shown that it would be welcomed by the broad masses, the positive resistance of the reactionary classes was no longer effective, and they had to disguise themselves in order to oppose socialism and prevent the birth of the Chinese working class party. Precisely because of this, they quickly exposed their true colors.
    Connected with the evaluation of the Research Clique, the editors listed the politicians of the Research Clique in the united front of the New Culture Movement (page 371), which is also worthy of study. The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, and the May Fourth New Culture Movement was a thorough anti-feudal cultural movement. The formation of the united front of the New Culture Movement, if taking the founding of "New Youth" in 1915 as a symbol, then according to the political performance of the political group of the Research Clique at that time, it does not seem possible to include them in the cultural united front. Later, they also promoted feudal culture (the so-called "Oriental civilization"); by the time of the so-called "Science and Outlook on Life Debate" in 1923, they belonged to the extremely reactionary "metaphysics" side (the "science" advocated by Hu Shi, Ding Wenjiang and others at that time was also reactionary). Therefore, judging from their previous and subsequent development process, it does not seem possible to include them in the cultural united front simply because they once promoted Guild Socialism and wanted to develop capitalism in China (with the purpose of opposing true socialism) for a short period of time.
    For example, when the editors introduced the special issue of "New Youth" on "Anarchism Discussion," the evaluation of the struggle of "New Youth" against anarchist thought seems to be insufficiently affirmative. It is completely necessary to point out the incompleteness, shortcomings and errors of this struggle; however, the editor's introduction gives a sense of complete negation. In fact, "New Youth" played a certain role in the struggle against anarchist thought at that time, and some arguments still seem to be not outdated today. Therefore, while introducing the incompleteness of this struggle, the editors should also point out its correct aspects, and do not have to dismiss it all as "tedious discussion" (page 27).
    The above are a few opinions that I thought of at any time after reading this book, which may not be correct and are for reference only.
    In short, this book is worth recommending, and the role it plays in the study of modern Chinese history, intellectual history, and the history of newspapers and periodicals will be significant. In particular, it will help solve many difficult problems in the history of the May Fourth Movement, and the solution of these problems has great practical significance for the dissemination of Marxism and its struggle against various bourgeois reactionary ideologies. In addition, for many years, the editors have traveled to many regions, collected rich original materials, and after careful research, wrote such a book. Such hard work is worthy of respect.

    简评“五四时期期刊介绍”

    新近出版的“五四时期期刊介绍”（第一集）是一本好书，是一本研究中国现代史、思想史、报刊史的重要参考书。
    这本书，是一本资料书，又是一本带有科学研究性质的著作。这本书的编辑方法，和一般的资料书不同，它不仅仅是一些原始资料的汇集，而且是以相当大量的篇幅（约占全书的二分之一），对原始资料进行了评述。在评述中，编者对大量的原始资料进行了研究，对许多问题提出了自己的观点。例如，在对“新青年”杂志的介绍中，编者就分析了它的三个阶段，指出了各个阶段的特点，并从一些代表人物和代表作品的研究中，指出了当时文化统一战线的形成和分化。又如，在对“晨报副刊”的介绍中，编者除了总括地论述了晨报及晨报副刊在五四时期的性质外，又分别介绍了李大钊同志在这个报纸上发表的文章和报纸上刊载的社会主义各种流派的著作、学说，以及俄国十月革命在中国的反映。在这些介绍中，编者都予以评价，特别是对各种非马克思主义的各种“社会主义”流派的谬论都予以分析批判。再如，在介绍“星期评论”中，编者通过具体材料的分析，揭示了戴季陶等在当时大谈社会主义的目的，并在综述了“星期评论”上所发表的对内对外的政治、经济主张后，指出：“它所反映的是中国民族资产阶级的利益、要求与幻想”。同时，编者也通过了大量材料的分析，指出这个刊物在当时所起的有利于马克思主义宣传的客观作用。
    除了对期刊的评述外，书中以另一半的篇幅，附录了有关刊物的发刊词和宣言，并附录了各种刊物的目录，这些附录提供了人们进一步研究的原始资料和线索。
    上述这种编辑资料书的方法和形式，给人们在阅读和使用这本书的时候，带来许多方便。
    这本书不仅在其编辑方法和形式上有优点，而且内容也很丰富。仅在这一集中，就介绍了下列二十一种刊物：“新青年”、“每周评论”、“国民”、“新潮”、“晨报副刊”、“湘江评论”、“新民学会会员通信集”、“星期评论”、“觉悟”（上海民国日报副刊）、“建设”、“少年中国”、“少年世界”、“星期日”、“少年社会”、“新生活”、“曙光”、“新社会”、“人道”、“觉悟”、“平民教育”和“解放与改造”。在这些刊物中，有许多是稀有的珍贵资料。通过以上各种刊物的观察，我们可以对五四时期的思想流派，有一个全貌的了解；同时对具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子在这个运动中所起的领导作用，也有一个比较深刻的认识。
    最近一个时期，历史学界研究中国近代、现代历史的兴趣浓厚起来了，人员也增加了。但是，人们大都感到资料缺乏的困难，因此，他们要求有关部门编辑出版一些系统的有关中国现代史的参考资料。“五四时期期刊介绍”的出版，可以开始满足了他们的一些要求。如果今后每一个历史时期都有这样几部以至几十部专题参考资料的出版，那就必将极大地推动中国现代史研究工作的开展。同时，这一工作，不仅要依靠北京的一些有关机关来做，而且要发挥地方的积极性；各地的中国现代史教学工作者和研究工作者，都可根据各地的特点和力所能及，编辑一定数量的专题参考资料。这样，分工合作，互通有无，将会收到更大的效果。
    这本书在一些问题的评述和估价上，尚有可以商榷之处。在这里，我想举出以下几个问题，谈谈我的一些看法。
    例如，关于研究系的性质，编者仅仅把它判断为“资产阶级改良派的政治集团”（第三五二页），而没有指出它的封建买办性，这是不够全面的。
    研究系是在1916年形成的一个政客集团。研究系组成后，在国内投靠段祺瑞，在国外和日本帝国主义相勾结。第一次世界大战期间，段祺瑞在日本帝国主义的嗾使下主张对德宣战，梁启超即以在野身分相呼应。1917年7月段祺瑞重新组阁，新内阁中有研究系分子六人，梁启超曾任财政部长。此后，研究系失势，但是在1918年的安福国会中，属于研究系的议员仍有二十多人。研究系的首领梁启超，曾经在戊戍变法运动时以资产阶级改良派的代表登上政治舞台，并起过一定程度的进步作用。但是，自那时以后，梁启超和康有为一样，即开始在政治上堕落，并一步步趋向反动了。
    至于为什么研究系分子在五四运动时期也大谈其“社会主义”呢？这只有一种解释，即当马克思主义宣传运动已经迅速展开并已表现出它将获得广大群众欢迎的时候，反动阶级的正面抵抗已无能为力，他们不得不伪装一下，以达到反对社会主义和阻止中国工人阶级政党诞生的目的。正因为是这样，所以他们很快地也就暴露了他们的真面目。
    和对研究系的评价相连系，编者把研究系的政客们列在新文化运动统一战线之内（第三七一页），这也是值得研究的。五四运动是反帝反封建的运动，而五四新文化运动是彻底地反对封建文化的运动。新文化统一战线的结成，如果拿1915年“新青年”的创办为标志，那么根据研究系的政客集团当时在政治上的表现，似乎不能把他们列在文化统一战线之内。以后，他们还曾宣扬过封建文化（所谓“东方文明”）；到了1923年的所谓“科学与人生观论战”，他们则是属于极端反动的“玄学”一方的（当时胡适、丁文江等人所谓的“科学”也是反动的）。因此，根据他们的前后发展过程来看，似乎不能因为他们曾经短时间内宣扬过基尔特社会主义和要在中国发展资本主义（目的是反对真正的社会主义），就把他们列在文化统一战线之内。
    再如，编者在介绍“新青年”上的“无政府主义讨论”的专辑时，对“新青年”反对无政府主义思想的斗争的评价，似乎肯定不够。对这次斗争的不彻底性、缺点和错误予以指出，是完全必要的；但是，编者的介绍却给人以全盘否定之感。事实上，“新青年”在当时反对无政府主义思想斗争上，曾经起过一定作用，有些论点在今天看来仍是不过时的。因此，编者在介绍这次斗争的不彻底性的同时，对其正确的地方，似乎也应该指出，而不必一概贬之为“繁琐议论”（第二七页）。
    以上几点意见，是我看过这本书后随时想到的，不一定正确，仅供参考。
    总之，这本书是值得推荐的，它对中国现代史、思想史、报刊史研究工作所起的作用也会是重大的。特别是它会有助于五四运动史上的许多疑难问题的解决，而这些问题的解决，对于马克思主义的传播及其和各种资产阶级反动思潮作斗争，都有着极大的现实意义。此外，多年以来，编者同志们跑遍了许多地区，搜集了丰富的原始资料，并经过了认真的研究，才写出了这样的一本书。这样的辛勤劳动，是值得尊重的。
