    Familiarize Yourself with Rural Life
    Romanian artists, responding to the call of the Writers' Association and other art creation associations, have been going deep into the countryside to experience life. Not long ago, one hundred and forty writers, painters, sculptors, actors, and musicians from Bucharest, the capital of Romania, went to the countryside of Bucharest State, Constanța State, Craiova State, Pitești State, and Ploiești State. They will live in the countryside for a longer period, on the one hand to help rural areas carry out cultural and artistic activities, and on the other hand to better familiarize themselves with the new life in the rural areas of the motherland.

    熟悉农村生活
    罗马尼亚的艺术家响应作家协会和其他艺术创作协会的号召，纷纷深入农村体验生活。不久以前，罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特的一百四十名作家、画家、雕塑家、演员、音乐家前往布加勒斯特州、康斯坦萨州、克拉约瓦州、毕特什蒂州和普洛也什蒂州的农村。他们要在乡下居住较长的时期，一方面帮助农村开展文化和艺术活动，一方面更好地熟悉祖国农村的新生活。
