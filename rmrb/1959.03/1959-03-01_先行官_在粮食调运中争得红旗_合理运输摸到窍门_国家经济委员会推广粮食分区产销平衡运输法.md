    “Pioneer Officials” Win Red Banner in Grain Transfer
    Rational Transportation Discovers the Knack
    State Economic Commission Promotes Regional Grain Production and Sales Balance Transportation Method
    Taking Grain Nearby, Supplying Nearby, Eliminating Countercurrents, Saving Transportation Capacity

    Xinhua News Agency, 28th – Grain department employees have creatively implemented the advanced experience of "regional grain production and sales balance rational transportation," achieving significant results in ensuring the rational allocation and timely supply of grain, and saving national transportation capacity and costs. The State Economic Commission recently convened a special meeting to introduce this experience of the grain department to various central industrial, financial, and trade departments. The meeting highly praised this experience, considering it an important measure to eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as countercurrent, duplication, and circuitous transportation of materials, alleviate transportation tension, and save transportation resources. The State Economic Commission requested relevant central departments to conscientiously promote the experience of the Ministry of Grain and quickly propose rational transportation plans for materials such as pig iron, ore, coal, timber, and cement for 1959, so that the transportation of various major materials can be rationalized as soon as possible.

    Since 1956, due to the adherence to the regional production and sales balance rational transportation system, the grain department has ensured that the vast majority of grain transferred on the main transportation lines across the country meets economic and rational requirements. According to preliminary calculations, the average transportation distance of grain on the main transportation lines in 1956 was reduced by 50 kilometers compared to 1955, saving the country approximately 864.4 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity; in 1958, according to statistics from 24 provinces and autonomous regions, more than 100 million yuan was saved in transportation costs and other expenses.

    The content of the regional production and sales balance rational transportation system implemented by the grain department is to formulate rational circulation scopes and directions for grain, based on the grain production and sales situation and transportation conditions, according to the principle of taking grain nearby and supplying nearby, as the basis for grain transfer. In the past few years, the grain department has researched the production and sales situation of 11 varieties, including wheat, rice, polished rice, flour, sorghum, and corn, and delineated the production and sales balance zones and rational circulation directions for each variety. In general, grain is transferred according to the zones and rational circulation directions. When special circumstances arise that require transportation in violation of the prescribed direction, it must be approved by the Ministry of Grain (temporary transportation outside the plan may be approved by the provincial-level grain department). When delineating the production and sales balance zones, the Ministry of Grain paid special attention to combining the production, transportation, and sales aspects, not only requiring the transportation department to ensure the realization of the supply plan, but also requiring the consigning department to save transportation capacity and rationally use various transportation tools as much as possible. Therefore, when transferring grain, some measures adopted include using more waterways and less railways, transporting more finished grain and less raw grain, and using return vehicles and ships for loading, etc. In this way, not only can the grain needed by cities be supplied nearby, but also various transportation tools can be used rationally, saving a large amount of transportation capacity.

    In order to thoroughly implement the rational transportation system, in addition to formulating (or revising) the rational flow direction map of grain on the main transportation lines of the country once a year, the Ministry of Grain and the local grain transportation departments also jointly prepare monthly transportation plans, and the monthly transfer plans are expressed through charts. Any unreasonable transportation routes discovered are immediately adjusted. This is the "chart operation method" explored and created by grain transfer staff from their actual work. From July 1956 to December 1957, the grain volume adjusted by the Ministry of Grain through this method reached more than 2.2 million tons.

    In addition to implementing rational transportation on the main transportation lines, the grain department also gradually promoted rational transportation in rural grain transportation and urban grain handling from 1956. The implementation of rational transportation in rural areas mainly involves combining the annual summer and autumn grain purchase and storage, leaving the grain needed for local supply and storage according to the plan; and adopting the method of collecting and transporting the grain that should be transferred out, directly sending it to warehouses along the transportation lines, and some directly to supply points near rural areas (such as some small towns). In this way, both the local supply and the needs of outward transfer can be guaranteed, and repeated transportation can be avoided, saving a large amount of rural labor.

    The implementation of rational grain transportation in cities involves adopting fixed points and routes, assigning areas of responsibility, and direct handling, based on the source of grain transferred from other places and the needs of urban supply, and according to the distribution of warehouses, processing plants, and supply points in the city. There are detailed plans for which routes the grain transported to the station or pier of each city needs to pass through, which warehouse or processing plant to transport it to, and which retail outlets to supply the grain processed by each processing plant, etc., so as to minimize handling links and shorten handling distances as much as possible, in order to save transportation capacity and transportation costs.

    The close connection of rational transportation work in the three aspects of transportation lines, rural areas, and cities enables grain to form a unified whole through the transfer plan from acquisition, processing, storage, transportation, and sales. This is the specific embodiment of the action slogans put forward by the grain transfer staff, such as "Full house of transfer plans, one-stop rational transportation" and "Layers of fixed flow directions, everywhere emphasizing rationality, interlocking links, and interconnected pulses."

    Based on the summary of three years of experience in implementing rational transportation, the Ministry of Grain recently re-formulated the 1959 annual regional grain production and sales balance rational transportation plan. This plan further embodies the spirit of taking grain locally, assigning areas of responsibility, overall planning, and unified dispatch. In addition to continuing to leverage the advantages of past successful experiences, the plan also determines to gradually stabilize the relationship between grain production, sales, supply, and allocation, so that closer ties can be established between transfer-out areas and transfer-in areas. This plan has been reported to the State Economic Commission for approval and will be implemented nationwide from March 1.

    “先行官”在粮食调运中争得红旗
    合理运输摸到窍门
    国家经济委员会推广粮食分区产销平衡运输法
    就近取粮　就近供应消灭对流　节省运力
    新华社28日讯　粮食部门职工创造性地推行了“粮食分区产销平衡合理运输”的先进经验，在保证粮食的合理调拨和及时供应、节省国家运输力和运输费用等方面都收到了巨大的效果。国家经济委员会最近专门召开会议，向中央工业、财贸各部门介绍了粮食部门的这一经验。会议对这个经验给予很高评价，认为它是消灭物资运输对流、重复、迂回等不合理现象，缓和运输紧张，节约运输力量的一项重要措施。国家经济委员会要求中央有关部门认真推广粮食部的经验，并迅速提出生铁、矿石、煤炭、木材、水泥等物资1959年度的合理运输方案，使各种主要物资的运输尽快地做到合理化。
    粮食部门从1956年以来，由于坚持执行分区产销平衡合理运输制度，在全国主要交通干线上调运的粮食绝大部分已做到符合经济、合理的要求。据初步计算，1956年在主要交通干线上的粮食平均运程，比1955年缩短了五十公里，约为国家节省八亿六千四百多万吨公里的运输力；1958年据二十四个省、自治区的统计，节省运费等开支一亿多元。
    粮食部门所实行的分区产销平衡合理运输制度的内容，就是根据粮食产销情况和交通运输条件，按照就近取粮、就近供应的原则，制定粮食合理流转范围和流向，作为粮食调运的依据。几年来粮食部分别对小麦、稻谷、大米、面粉、高粱、玉米等十一个品种的产销情况进行了研究，划定了每一个品种的产销平衡区和合理流向。在一般情况下粮食按区、按合理流向进行调运，当遇有某种特殊情况，要违反规定流向进行运输时，需经粮食部批准（计划外的临时运输可由省级粮食部门批准）。在划分产销平衡区时，粮食部特别注意到把产、运、销三方面结合起来考虑，不单要求运输部门能够保证供应计划的实现，也要求托运部门尽可能节省运输力和合理地使用各种运输工具。因此在调运粮食时，有的采取多走水路少走铁路；有的采取多运成品粮、少运原粮；有的则利用回空的车船装运，等等。这样，不但保证城市需要的粮食能就近供应，而且合理地使用了各种运输工具，节省了大批运输力。
    粮食部为了彻底贯彻合理运输制度，每年除去制订（或修订）一次全国主要交通干线粮食的合理流向图以外，还由粮食部和地方粮食运输部门，每月共同编制月度运输计划，并且把每月的调运计划都通过图表表示出来，发现有不合理的运输线路立即进行调整，这就是粮食调运工作人员从实际工作中摸索创造出来的“图上作业法”。从1956年7月到1957年12月，粮食部通过这一方法调整的粮食运量即达二百二十多万吨。
    粮食部门除了在主要交通干线实行合理运输以外，从1956年开始，还逐步在农村的粮食运输和城市的粮食搬运方面也推行了合理运输。在农村实行合理运输，主要是结合每年夏秋粮征购入库时，把当地需要供应和储备的粮食按计划就地留下；把应该外调的粮食采取边收、边运的方法，直接送到交通沿线的仓库，有的直接送到农村附近的供应点（如一些小城镇）。这样，既能保证当地的供应，又能保证外调的需要，并避免重复运输，节约了大批的农村劳动力。
    在城市内实行粮食合理运输，就是根据外地调入的粮源和城市供应的需要，再根据市内仓库、加工厂、供应点的分布状况，采取定点定线，划片包干，直接搬运。每个城市的车站或码头运到的粮食，需要经过什么路线，运给哪个仓库或加工厂；每个加工厂加工出来的粮食供给哪些零售点出售等等，都有详细的计划，做到尽可能地减少搬运环节，缩短搬运距离，以节约运输力和运输费用的开支。
    交通干线、农村、城市三个方面合理运输工作的密切衔接，就使粮食从收购、加工、入库、运输、销售等环节，通过调运计划结成了一个统一的整体。这也就是粮食调运工作人员提出的“调运计划满堂红，合理运输一条龙”、“层层订流向，处处讲合理，环环相扣，脉脉相通”等行动口号的具体体现。
    粮食部最近在总结了三年来实行合理运输经验的基础上，又重新制订了1959年度粮食分区产销平衡合理运输方案，这个方案进一步体现了就地取粮、分片包干、全面规划、统一调度的精神，方案除继续发挥了过去成功经验的优点以外，还确定把粮食的产销、供应和调拨关系逐步固定起来，使调出地区和调入地区之间取得更密切的联系。这一方案已报经国家经济委员会核准，将从3月1日起在全国范围内实行。
