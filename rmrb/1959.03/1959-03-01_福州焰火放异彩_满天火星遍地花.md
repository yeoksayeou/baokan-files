Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th - On the evenings of the 24th and 25th, the province-wide fireworks exhibition was held continuously in Fuzhou's West Mi Park. At the exhibition, artists from Longxi, Nanping, Fu'an, Longyan regions, and Fuzhou and Xiamen cities, presented a total of sixty-eight programs with more than ten varieties of fireworks, including bamboo leaves, wooden thresholds, white pears, peonies, grapes, moon wheels, peacock tails, golden willow, ground plum blossoms, and half-sky drills. Among them, programs such as "Eighteen Scholars," "Rocket Dragon," "Five-Star Car," "Double Brightness," "Salute," "Fire Umbrella," "Skyrocket," "Sky Full of Sparks," "Flowers Blooming Everywhere," and "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" all have the characteristics of being launched high and far, with light, sound, and color. The traditional program "Eighteen Scholars" was originally named for emitting eighteen sounds in the air. Now, after the artists' processing, it can transform into various colors such as red, blue, purple, white, and yellow in the air, which is truly colorful and dazzling. Many other programs are based on traditional art, processed and created, and express new content, such as "Steel Flowers in Full Bloom," "Man-Made Satellite," "Steel Grain Harvest," "Liberate Taiwan," "People's Commune is Good," and "Long Live Peace." The "Double-Stage Rocket" and other programs designed by the young artist Lin Dazhou received high praise from the audience. Four generations of Lin Dazhou's family have been making fireworks. The "Double-Stage Rocket" fireworks are divided into two stages. When the first stage burns out in the air, it can push the second stage to a higher altitude. Now, Lin Dazhou and others are experimenting with "three-stage rockets" to make the fireworks fly even higher.

    福州焰火放异彩
    满天火星遍地花
    新华社福州28日电　24、25日两天晚上，福州市西汨公园里，连续举行了全省焰火观摩晚会。晚会上表演了龙溪、南平、福安、龙岩专区和福州、厦门市等六个代表队的艺人们带来的竹叶、木墀、白梨、牡丹、葡萄、月轮、孔雀尾、金丝柳、落地梅、半天钻等十多个花种的六十八个节目。其中如“十八学士”、“火箭龙”、“五星车”、“双光明”、“礼炮”、“火准伞”、“冲天炮”、“满天火星”、“遍地开花”、“百花齐放”等节目都具有放得高射得远，有光有声有色的特点。传统节目“十八学士”原是发射在空中响出十八声而得名，现在经艺人加工后，能在空中幻成红、蓝、紫、白、黄等各种颜色，真是五光十色，灿烂夺目。还有许多节目是在传统艺术的基础上，经过加工创造，表现了新的内容的，如“钢花怒放”、“人造卫星”、“钢粮丰收”、“解放台湾”、“人民公社好”、“和平万岁”等。青年艺人林大周设计出来的“双级火箭”等节目，得到观众很高的评价。林大周一家四代都会制造焰火。“双级火箭”焰火分为两级，第一级在空中燃烧结束时，能将二级推上更高空。现在，林大周等正在试验“三级火箭”，使焰火放得更高。
