“Large Characters Written in Blood”
Xiao San

Editor's Note: This article is an excerpt from the preface written by Comrade Xiao San for the "Anthology of Poems by Revolutionary Martyrs," with the title added by us. This book is soon to be published by the China Youth Publishing House. Our supplement will successively reprint some of the poems contained therein.

This "Anthology of Poems by Revolutionary Martyrs" is not an ordinary "anthology" or "collection." Its significance far exceeds that of general literary collections.

Its authors are rarely called poets. But every author—every revolutionary martyr—is in itself an incomparably magnificent and great poem. Their fighting lives, arduous work, their noble character, steadfast integrity, and their boundless loyalty to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution are all the greatest poems that are both moving and awe-inspiring.

"A great life, a glorious death." This is the inscription written by our great leader Chairman Mao for the tomb of Martyr Liu Hulan. It can be said that this is also a lofty praise for all revolutionary martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the cause of communism.

Martyr Yin Fu wrote a poem—"Blood Characters," the opening line of the first three stanzas all being: "Large characters written in blood."

Yes, precisely because of this, because every word and sentence left by the martyrs was written with their own blood, rather than ordinary "creation," the often-quoted "the poem is the person" is most evident and glorious in this anthology.

Revolutionary martyrs are true and great poets.

The poems of revolutionary martyrs are majestic music that resounds through the clouds.

As I participated in the editing work of this anthology, I was able to revisit and read for the first time all the heroic poems, and my heart was often very moved. I thought of the heroic images of those martyrs whom I had known and worked with, and the heroic images of those martyrs who, although I had never met them, stood towering in my mind after reading their posthumous poems. I often couldn't help but stop writing and silently mourn and pay tribute to them all, one by one!

They, countless revolutionary martyrs, some left names or writings, and more did not even leave their names. But we know: without soil, Mount Tai cannot achieve its greatness; without small streams, rivers and seas cannot achieve their depth. The revolutionary process of the disaster-ridden Chinese people is a long, tortuous, arduous, and cruel process. Without the heroic sacrifices of thousands upon thousands of martyrs, the revolution could not have been victorious, and the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of humanity, could not have stood up.

Comrade Li Dazhao firmly predicted in an article before his death: "The future globe will surely be a world of red flags!"

Comrade Qu Qiubai said in his farewell words before facing execution: "To die for the Chinese revolution is the greatest glory in life."

Every time I recite the four lines of farewell poems written by Comrade Xia Minghan before his execution—“It doesn't matter if I lose my head, as long as my beliefs are true. If you kill Xia Minghan, there will be successors!”—I cannot help but lower my head and pay my deepest respects to him, and then stand up and be willing to be the "successor" he spoke of.

I seem to always hear Comrade Yang Chao's heroic words, recited loudly at the time of his execution: "The sky is full of wind and rain, the sky is full of sorrow. Why should revolution fear decapitation? Leaving Zixu's heroic spirit behind, I will return to avenge King Chu in three years!" I also seem to see Ji Hongchang writing his heroic words on the execution ground with a branch: "Regret not dying fighting against the Japanese, leaving myself to be ashamed today. The country is broken like this, why should I begrudge this head!" The "Song of Heroism" sung by Liu Shaonan on the execution ground will forever resound through the clouds—“…Martyrs, heroes! Under the guillotine, unyielding. Kill me if you want to kill me, behead me if you want to behead me. If you want me to denounce the Party, I will never speak. Kill me alone, but the revolution will never be killed." Comrade Li Shaoshi's posthumous poem will forever inspire future generations: "Do not die an ordinary death in bed, a hero goes to the execution ground with a smile." "It is only right to live in hardship and worry, it is not sad to die for righteousness." "Do not be surprised that I lightly cast away my head, it is to relieve the drowning and rescue the drowning." Comrade Lü Huisheng's "Leaving a loyal heart to shine in history" written in prison shows what a lofty ambition the Communists have: "How can I bear to see the mountains and rivers shattered? I am willing to shed my red blood… For eight years, I have been firm in my will, loyal and dedicated to repaying the country. I am glad that dawn is breaking, what do I seek by dying!” Comrade Chen Ran's "Confession" written in prison, denouncing the enemy, shows what a steadfast integrity the Communists have: "...Facing death, I laugh loudly, the devil's palace trembles in the laughter; this is my confession as a Communist Party member, singing a funeral song to bury the Chiang dynasty."

In the face of such brave and determined Communists, all the enemy's cruel atrocities can only accelerate their own demise, and cannot destroy the Communists' great ideals in the slightest!

Comrade Ye Ting wrote a poem in prison in Chongqing, the last sentence of which is: "I should gain eternal life in the flames and hot blood." Comrade Guo Moruo said: "His poems are written with life and blood, his poems are himself." – These two sentences can be used as a portrayal of every revolutionary martyr and every poem they wrote.

Our martyrs, outstanding members of the Chinese Communist Party, each held the courage and determination of "I have discarded ordinary matters of worry and hardship, leaving heroic feelings as a captive of Chu" (poem by Comrade Yun Daiying) and "The enemy can only cut off our heads, but can never shake our beliefs" (poem by Comrade Fang Zhimin); all possessed the style and quality of "Walking the long street in shackles, my ambition grows more lofty" (poem by Comrade Liu Bojian) and "With a determined heart, bitter juice tastes sweet"; all expressed the indomitable spirit of "Let the heavy iron shackles clang under my feet, let you raise the whip high, I don't need any confession, even if a bloody bayonet is pointed at my chest..." (poem by Comrade Chen Ran). Their boundless loyalty to the Party, to the proletariat, and to the people's revolutionary cause is truly "as firm as gold, as bright as gold" (Cai Mengwei: "Will is Shining"), setting a model for all Party members and all revolutionary people for all generations, and has achieved what the ancients called "establishing virtue"—the highest morality of communism.

They, our outstanding Communist Party members, under the leadership of the Party, in various posts and on various fronts, have waged heroic and tireless intense struggles against all kinds of enemies; they have awakened and organized the masses of the people to embark on revolution, and pushed the revolutionary cause and the wheels of history forward; they have the lofty ambition of "In order to免除 the suffering of future generations, we are willing, willing to wear through the bottom of this prison," and finally made the cause of "worker and peasant liberation" achieve today's victory, and they have also achieved what the ancients said "立功" - made great contributions to the people.

In addition, countless martyrs have also achieved what the ancients called "立言"—that is, they have also left many insightful and moving works. For example, Comrade Li Dazhao's "Shouchang Essays," Comrade Cai Hesen's correspondence and political essays, Comrade Qu Qiubai's "Qu Qiubai's Collected Works," Comrade Peng Pai's "Diary of the Peasant Movement," Comrade Deng Zhongxia's "A Brief History of the Chinese Workers' Movement," Comrade Zhao Shigui's articles describing the armed uprising of Shanghai workers, Comrade Fang Zhimin's "Lovely China" and "Records from Prison" and other works, as well as the many enthusiastic articles written for young people by Comrade Yun Daiying and Comrades Lin Yunan, Xiao Chunu, and Li Qiushi, Rou Shi's novels, Yin Fu's poems, etc. These posthumous works have been published or will continue to be published successively after the national liberation. They have extremely significant political and educational significance for our younger generation—not just the younger generation.

The martyrs' posthumous works we have compiled in this anthology are only a portion of the poems created by the revolutionary predecessors that we have initially collected, and the works of comrades such as Li Dazhao, Qu Qiubai, Yin Fu, Xu Fanting, Li Shaoshi, and Chen Hui are only a small part of all their poems. We will continue to collect and publish them in the future.

The ancients said: "Poetry expresses ambition." Modern people often say: Poetry is the expression of true feelings. Indeed, through the poems of revolutionary martyrs, we can deeply feel the great minds of the revolutionary predecessors; these poems are the great voices of the revolutionaries. At the same time, poetry is the easiest to spread and the most moving, so many of the martyrs' poems, although only a few short lines, are truly more powerful and inspiring than thousands of lines of long poems when read.

The martyrs knew their historical mission. Therefore, they also deeply understood their mission of writing poetry and songs.

Comrade Li Dazhao wrote "Sending to Friends at the End of the Year," Comrade Deng Zhongxia wrote "A Blow to the Head of New Poets," Comrade Peng Pai wrote "Labor Day Song," Comrade Yang Jingyu wrote "Anti-Japanese Allied Army First Route Army Song," Comrade Li Zhaolin wrote "Camp Song"... These are all poems of propaganda and encouragement for the current political service that they directly created with their own pens.

Yin Fu, who wrote poetry from a young age and later became a revolutionary poet, deserves to be called "the eldest son of history, the sharp thorn of the petrel era" ("Blood Characters"). Almost all of his poems are coordinated with current tasks. He is our communist, proletarian poet. He has several poems that clearly express his attitude toward poetry creation:

We are young Bolsheviks,
Everything - is steel:
Our heads,
Our language,
Our discipline!
       -- "We are young Bolsheviks"

These lines of poetry can truly serve as a motto for young readers. He puts steel language on a par with steel heads and steel discipline, which shows how serious and conscientious the martyrs were about writing.

Such poems are fighting poems, such poets are fighting poets. They are first and foremost revolutionaries—doing revolutionary work, and then writing poetry. Writing poetry is also for the needs of revolutionary work. They are first and foremost Communist Party members, and then poets. Writing poetry expresses the noble character of Communist Party members.

The posthumous poems of revolutionary martyrs that we have collected so far are still very incomplete – this remains to be gradually discovered, and many revolutionary seniors and relatives and friends of martyrs still have a lot of valuable information that can be slowly recalled or collected, which depends on us, the vast number of readers who died later, to continue to collect.

However, even from this anthology, we have already seen a magnificent scene of thousands of purples and reds, seen the high political and artistic value of the martyrs' poems, and seen various creative methods and styles; there are realism and romanticism, but they are all proletarian revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and most of them are a combination of the two.

The martyrs themselves were revolutionary fighters who went deep into life, had close ties with the people, and participated in fiery and intense practical struggles. Their poems all express their fervent love for the motherland, love for the people, and loyalty to the Party, showing their heroic and majestic spirit, unwavering will, and confidence in the victory of the revolution. The ideological nature of these poems is undoubtedly strong. Some martyrs wrote both old-style poems and new-style poems. Because the poems are burning with intense class feelings, they are all written very well. For example, Comrade Deng Zhongxia's "Contribution to New Poets" (old-style poem) and "A Blow to the Head of New Poets" (new-style poem); another example is Ren Rui's "Sending My Son to the Front Line," which is a good five-character ancient poem. Her new-style poem "Midnight," as the wife of a martyr, writes about the heart of a mother very intimately, although desolate but optimistic, and is also written very well.

Comrade Qu Qiubai enthusiastically advocated the popularization of literature and art during his lifetime, and tried his best to think about the laboring masses. He "spoke and acted," and wrote a popular long poem "Japanese Troops on the March," and published it in both Mandarin and Shanghai dialects. This shows that our Communists and professional revolutionaries have never fallen into the mire of bourgeois idealistic "art for art's sake," but always advocated and practiced art for revolution and art for struggle. Comrade Qiubai also wrote lyrics, such as "Red Tide Song," and was good at using traditional national forms. His "Pingjin Order" zaju opera and old-style "Untitled" and "Wang Dao's Poetic Talks" were also extremely satirical.

Comrade He Jinzhai's poems and lyrics skillfully used the old style to write revolutionary content. In the letter he wrote to his younger brother Jinzhang before his martyrdom, he attached two poems, one of which contains the line "I will give my body to my Party... I vow to eliminate tigers and wolves for the people." His younger brother wrote a mourning poem saying: "I only know the Party, I don't know anything else... A cavity of hot blood is sprinkled on the sand" (Sand is the name of the place where Martyr Jinzhai died). This is not an ordinary correspondence between ordinary poets, but a hot-blooded exchange and mutual understanding between revolutionary poets. This profound revolutionary friendship is also movingly expressed in Xu Xiaoxuan's "Farewell Gift" and the Guizhou martyrs' "Feeling after reading 'Feeling赋' and respectfully echoing the original rhyme." And Xu Fanting's "Gift to Chairman Mao," Yuan Guoping's "Responding to Chairman Mao's Long March Poem," and Li Shaoshi's "Wishing Elder Dong a Happy Sixtieth Birthday" express the infinite respect of revolutionary soldiers for revolutionary leaders and revolutionary predecessors.

Comrade Huang Li's only surviving song "Workers' Suffering" is very popular. The young martyr Ouyang Li'an's "Who Built the World's Foreign Buildings" also uses old forms to write new content.

What is of particular interest to our readers today is the four-line mountain song sung by Guangdong female martyr Zhang Jianzhen at the time of her execution: "Everyone calls me a Communist Mother, I would rather die than marry Zhang Jiuhua! Red and white will always be a contest, the white flowers wither and the red flowers bloom." And another mountain song sung by a rural female martyr from Guangdong at the time of her execution: "Blowing the horn and carrying a gun, so many soldiers come to escort me to the funeral, so many officials act as filial sons, dying in the underworld will make my heart cool."

In terms of poetic form, both of these are close to folk songs. This is very natural, because the martyrs themselves were working women. Their language is very simple, but very powerful: strong, hearty, and humorous. When you read it, you can see the revolutionary martyrs' calm attitude, inner pride, optimism, fearlessness, and the spirit of seeing death as home.

Due to space limitations, I cannot list them one by one. In short, whether old-style, new-style, metrical poems, or free verse, the martyrs' posthumous works are all good poems and can be repeatedly savored. What Mr. Lu Xun said: that literature written by revolutionaries is revolutionary literature, and that what is squeezed out of blood vessels is blood, is fully confirmed here again.

After each revolutionary martyr's posthumous poem, we also attached a brief biography of the martyr, and selected some poetic talks written by certain comrades about these posthumous works. We have also made some notes on certain historical facts and relatively difficult words and sentences involved in the poems, in order to help readers understand the person by reading his poems, and also to generally understand the revolutionary situation at that time. We believe that these appendices are beneficial to young readers. In particular, the articles written by the martyrs' comrades-in-arms and relatives are sincere, moving, and shocking.

Recently, many comrades in various parts of the country have been writing revolutionary memoirs, which is very gratifying. It is appropriate that it is very popular among readers. This type of work is a good textbook for conducting revolutionary tradition education and communist ideological and moral quality education for the broad masses of the people, especially the younger generation.

Our martyrs are all "宁断头颅不改心……壮志凌云死亦生" [rather have their heads cut off than change their hearts... lofty aspirations soar into the sky, death is also life]. They firmly believed that "red and white will always be distinguished, white flowers will wither and red flowers will bloom," so they are all full of revolutionary optimism and proudly despise the enemy: "Beheading and shooting, – retire and return to the hometown, severe torture, – a simple meal at home" (Comrade Lin Jilu). They are indeed "A death is as heavy as Mount Tai, and their fragrance will last forever." The last two lines of the inscription on the wall in prison by the martyrs of Longhua are well written: "Peach blossoms outside the wall, blood inside the wall, equally bright and equally red." It is the blood of the martyrs that has irrigated our sacred land and the flowers of socialism-communism.

Martyr Chen Hui, who bravely sacrificed himself at the young age of twenty-four, once wrote:

My life
Is torn to pieces by the enemy,
But my flesh and blood,
It will
Turn into fragrant flowers,
Blooming on your way.
       ——"Dedication Poem - Song for the Garden of Eden"

On the mound of yellow earth burying my bones,
There will also be bright red flowers growing.
     ——“Song for the Motherland”

Yes, martyr comrades, on every road and every pile of soil in the whole of China today, countless bright flowers of love, flowers of happiness, and flowers of freedom are growing. Let the martyrs rest in peace! We will always commemorate them and learn from them. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and encouraged by the martyrs, we should redouble our efforts to build our great and beautiful motherland, so as to inherit the unfinished will of the martyrs. As Martyr Yin Fu wrote:

Let the dead die,
Their blood will not flow in vain...
They fulfilled their responsibilities,
We still have to brace ourselves.

Let us, the whole Party and the whole people, be of one heart and one mind, unite as one, and gradually realize the great ideals of Chinese patriots in the past century, the great ideals of revolutionary martyrs, protect our hard-won revolutionary fruits, protect the freedom and happiness of our people, and protect lasting peace, in accordance with the direction indicated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

    “血液写成的大字”
    萧三
    编者按：　这篇文章是萧三同志为“革命烈士诗抄”写的序言的摘要，题目是我们加的。这本书即将由中国青年出版社出版。本报副刊上将要陆续转载其中一部分诗作。
    这本“革命烈士诗抄”，不是普通的“诗抄”或“诗集”。它的意义远远超过一般的诗文集。
    它的作者很少是被称为诗人的。但是每一个作者——每一个革命烈士本身就是一篇无比壮丽、无比伟大的诗章。他们的战斗的生活、艰苦的工作，他们的崇高的人格、坚贞的操守，他们对于中国人民革命事业无限忠诚的赤心，都是可歌可泣、足以惊天地而动鬼神的最伟大的诗篇。
    “生的伟大，死的光荣。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席为刘胡兰烈士墓所写的题词。可以说，这也是对一切为共产主义事业英勇牺牲的革命烈士的崇高赞誉。
    殷夫烈士写过一首诗——“血字”，前三节的开头一句都是：“血液写成的大字”。
    是的，就因为这样，就因为烈士们遗留下来的每字每句都是用自己的鲜血写出来的，而不是寻常的“创作”，所以常言说的“诗如其人”在这本诗抄里表现得最为明显也最为光辉。
    革命烈士们都是真正的、伟大的诗人。
    革命烈士们的诗，都是雄壮的、响彻云霄的音乐。
    笔者参加这本诗抄的编辑工作，得以重温和初读全部壮烈的诗章，内心经常十分激动。我想起那些曾经认识和共同工作过的烈士们的英雄形象，以及那些虽然不曾认识但是读了遗诗就在我的脑际巍然矗立起来的烈士们的英雄形象，每每不由得停下笔来，默默向他们全体和一个个致哀，致敬！
    他们，无数的革命烈士，有的留下了姓名或著作，更多的是连姓名都没留下来。但是我们知道：没有土壤，泰山不能成其大；没有细流，河海不能就其深。灾难深重的中国人民的革命过程，是漫长而曲折、艰苦而残酷的过程。没有千千万万先烈的英勇牺牲，革命就不能胜利，约占人类四分之一的中国人民就不能站起来。
    李大钊同志生前在一篇文章里就曾坚定地预言：“将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界！”
    瞿秋白同志在赴难时的诀词中又说过：“为中国革命而死是人生最大的光荣。”
    当我每次背诵夏明翰同志就义时的四句绝笔诗——“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。杀了夏明翰，还有后来人！”都不禁低下头来向他深深地致敬，然后又立起身子愿作他所说的“后来人”。
    我似乎永远听见杨超同志就义时高声朗诵的英雄壮语：“满天风雨满天愁，革命何须怕断头？留得子胥豪气在，三年归报楚王仇！”我也似乎看到吉鸿昌同志在刑场地上用树枝所写的壮士豪言：“恨不抗日死，留作今日羞，国破尚如此，我何惜此头！”刘绍南同志在刑场上高唱的“壮烈歌”将永远响彻云霄——“……烈，豪杰！铡刀下，不变节，要杀就杀，要砍就砍，要我说党，我决不说。杀死我一人，革命杀不绝。”李少石同志的遗诗将永远激励后代：“不作寻常床箦死，英雄含笑上刑场。”“生当忧患原应尔，死得成仁未足悲。” “莫讶头颅轻一掷，解悬拯溺是吾徒。”吕惠生同志在狱中写的“留取丹心照汗青”表现了共产党人何等崇高的抱负：“忍看山河碎？愿将赤血流……八载坚心志，忠贞为国酬，且欣天破晓，竟死我何求！”陈然同志在狱中痛斥敌人写的“自白书”又表现了共产党人何等坚贞的气节：“……对着死亡我放声大笑，魔鬼的宫殿在笑声中动摇；这就是我——一个共产党员的自白，高唱葬歌埋葬蒋家王朝。”
    在这样英勇坚毅的共产党员的面前，敌人的一切残酷暴行只能加速自己的灭亡，而对共产党人的伟大理想一丝一毫也摧折不了！
    叶挺同志在重庆狱中写过一首诗，诗的最后一句是：“我应该在烈火和热血中得到永生。”郭沫若同志说：“他的诗是用生命和血写成的，他的诗就是他自己。”——这两句话，可以作为每个革命烈士和他们所写的每一首诗的写照。
    我们的烈士，中国共产党的优秀党员，每一位都抱着“己摈忧患寻常事，留得豪情作楚囚”（恽代英同志诗）、“敌人只能砍下我们的头颅，决不能动摇我们的信仰”（方志敏同志诗）的勇气和决心；都具备着“带镣长街行，志气愈轩昂”（刘伯坚同志诗）、“心志既坚定，苦汁甘如饴”的风格和品质；都表现了“任脚下响着沉重的铁镣，任你把皮鞭举得高高，我不需要什么自白，哪怕胸口对着带血的刺刀……”（陈然同志诗）的宁死不屈的磅礴气概。他们这种对党、对无产阶级、对人民革命事业的无限忠诚，真“像金子一般的坚，像金子一般的亮”（蔡梦慰：“意志在闪光”），给我们全党党员、全体革命人民树立了万代楷模，已经作到了古人所说的“立德”——共产主义的最高道德。
    他们，我们优秀的共产党员，在党的领导下，在各个岗位，各条战线上，同各色各样的敌人进行过英勇不懈的剧烈的斗争；唤醒了、组织了人民群众走向革命，把革命事业、历史车轮推向前进；他们具有“为了免除下一代的苦难，我们愿，愿把这牢底坐穿”的崇高抱负，终于使“工农齐解放”的事业得到了今天的胜利，他们又做到了古人说的“立功”——为人民立下了大功。
    此外，无数烈士，还做到了古人所说的“立言”——这就是他们还留下了许多精辟感人的著作。例如李大钊同志的“守常文集”，蔡和森同志的通信和政治论文，瞿秋白同志的“瞿秋白文集”，彭湃同志的“农民运动日记”，邓中夏同志的“中国职工运动简史”，赵世贵同志的记述上海工人武装起义等文章，方志敏同志的“可爱的中国”、“狱中纪实”等著作，以及恽代英同志和林育南、萧楚女、李求实诸同志为青年写的许多热情的文章，柔石同志的小说，殷夫同志的诗等等，这些遗作，在全国解放以后都已陆续出版或将要继续出版。它们对于我们青年一代——不仅青年一代——都有极其重大的政治教育意义。
    我们现在辑录在这本诗抄里的烈士遗作，只是目前我们初步收集到的一部分革命先烈的诗歌创作，而且如李大钊、瞿秋白、殷夫、续范亭、李少石、陈辉诸同志的作品，也只是他们全部诗作中一小部分。今后我们还将继续收集出版。
    古人说：“诗以言志”。现代人常说：诗是真实感情的流露。的确，通过革命烈士的诗作，我们可以深切感到革命先烈们的伟大襟怀；这些诗，都是革命者的伟大心声。同时，诗歌又是最容易传诵、最能动人心弦的，因此，许多烈士的诗作，虽然只有短短的几行，但读起来真是比千行长诗还有力量，更加使人受到感动和鼓舞。
    烈士们知道自己的历史使命的。因此，他们也都深刻理解自己写诗作歌的使命。
    李大钊同志写“岁晚寄友”，邓中夏同志写“新诗人的棒喝”，彭湃同志写“劳动节歌”，杨靖宇同志写“抗日联军第一路军歌”，李兆麟同志写“露营之歌”……这些都是他们直接用自己的笔，创作了为当前政治服务的宣传鼓动的诗歌。
    从小就写诗、后来成为革命诗人的殷夫同志，不愧为“历史的长子，海燕时代的尖刺”（“血字”）。他的几乎全部诗歌都是配合当前任务的。他是我们共产主义的、无产阶级的诗人。他有几首诗，很鲜明地表达了他对诗歌创作的态度：
    我们是青年的布尔塞维克，
    一切——都是钢铁：
    我们的头颅，
    我们的语言，
    我们的纪律！
           ——“我们是青年布尔塞维克”
    这几句诗，真可以作为青年读者们的座右铭。他把钢铁的语言和钢铁的头颅、钢铁的纪律并举，可见烈士对于写作是怎样严肃而认真。
    这样的诗是战斗的诗，这样的诗人是战斗的诗人。他们首先是革命者——干革命工作，然后才是写诗。写诗也是为了革命工作的需要。他们首先是共产党员，然后才是诗人。写诗正表达了共产党员崇高的品德。
    我们目前收集到的革命烈士的诗歌遗著，还很不完全——这有待于逐渐发现，许多革命前辈和烈士亲友还有很多宝贵资料可以慢慢回忆或搜集，这又有赖于后死者的我们广大读者继续不断地收辑。
    但是，仅从这本诗抄里，我们已经看到了万紫千红的盛景，看到了烈士诗作的高度政治价值和艺术价值，看到了各种各样的创作方法和风格；有现实主义的，有浪漫主义的，但都是无产阶级的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义，而且大都是二者相结合的。
    烈士们自己都是深入生活的革命战士，和人民有密切的联系，都参加了火热的、剧烈的实际斗争。他们的诗作都写出了自己爱祖国、爱人民和对党忠诚的热烈感情，显示了他们豪迈磅礴的气魄、坚定不移的意志和对革命胜利的信心。这些诗作的思想性，无疑都是强烈的。有些烈士又写旧体诗，又写新体诗。由于诗中燃烧着炽烈的阶级感情，都写得很好。例如邓中夏同志的“贡献给新诗人”（旧体诗），“新诗人的棒喝”（新体诗）；又如，任锐同志的“送儿上前线”，这是一首好的五言古体诗。她的新体诗“午夜”，作为烈士之妻，写母亲的心非常亲切，虽凄凉而乐观，也写得很好。
    瞿秋白同志生前热情地提倡文艺大众化，极力为劳动人民群众着想。他“坐而言，起而行”，自己写了一篇“东洋人出兵”的大众化长诗，而且用普通话和上海话两种语文发表。由此可见我们共产党人和职业的革命者从来就都不陷入资产阶级唯心主义“为艺术而艺术”的泥坑，而总是主张和实行为革命而艺术、为斗争而艺术的。秋白同志也写歌词，如“赤潮曲”，又善于利用民族的传统形式。他的“平津令”杂剧和旧体“无题”、“王道诗话”又极尽讽刺之能事。
    贺锦斋同志的诗与词，熟练地利用旧体来写革命的内容。他在殉难前写给乃弟锦章同志的信中附诗二首，其中有“吾将吾身交吾党……誓为人民灭虎狼”之句。其弟作悼诗说：“只知有党不知他……一腔热血洒泥沙”（泥沙是锦斋烈士死难地名）。这不是一般诗作者的普通唱和，而是革命诗人们的热血交流和赤心相印。这种深挚的革命交谊，在许晓轩同志的“赠别”，贵州殉难者的“读‘感赋’有感敬和原韵”等中也有动人的抒发。而续范亭同志的“赠毛主席”、袁国平同志的“和毛主席长征诗”、李少石同志的“祝董老六十大寿”，更表述了革命战士对于革命领袖和革命前辈的无限敬意。
    黄励同志仅存的一首歌“工人苦”，非常通俗。青年烈士欧阳立安同志的“天下洋楼什么人造”也是利用旧形式写新内容。
    使我们读者今天特别感到兴趣的，还有广东女烈士张剑珍同志就义时唱的四句山歌：“人人喊我共产嫲，死都呒（不）嫁张九华！红白总要分胜负，白花谢了开红花。”和又一位广东农村女烈士就义时唱的一首山歌：“又吹号筒又拿枪，咁多士兵来送葬，咁多官员做孝子，死到阴间心也凉。”
    论诗体，这两首都接近民歌。这是很自然的，因为烈士本人就是劳动妇女。她们的语言非常朴素，然而很有气魄：坚强、豪爽，而且幽默，你读时，看得见革命烈士的态度从容，内心骄傲，乐观无畏，视死如归的神情。
    限于篇幅，我不能一篇篇地列举了。总之，无论旧体、新体、格律诗、自由诗，烈士们的遗著都是好诗，都可以反复吟味。鲁迅先生所说的：是革命者写出来的文学便是革命文学，是血管挤出来的便是血，在这里又得到了充分的证实。
    在每位革命烈士的遗诗后面，我们还附了烈士的事略，并选载了某些同志所写有关这些遗作的诗话。对于诗中涉及的某些史实和比较难解的词句，我们也作了一些注释，这是为了帮助读者读其诗而知其人，也大概地了解一下当时的革命形势。我们相信，这些附录对于青年读者是有益处的。特别是烈士的战友亲属所写的文章，都是真挚动人足以震撼人心的。
    近来全国各地许多同志都在写革命回忆录，这是十分可喜的事情。宜乎很受读者的欢迎。这类著作是对广大人民特别是对青年一代进行革命传统教育和共产主义思想品质教育的良好教材。
    我们的烈士们都是“宁断头颅不改心……壮志凌云死亦生”的。他们坚信“红白总要分胜负，白花谢了开红花”，因此他们无不充满革命的乐观主义精神，并且自豪地蔑视敌人：“砍头枪毙，——告老还乡，严刑拷打，——便饭家常”（林基路同志）。他们的确是“一死真如泰山重，千年万古永留芳”。龙华殉难者的狱中题壁最后两句写得好：“墙外桃花墙里血，一般鲜艳一般红。”正是烈士们的鲜血灌溉了我们神圣的国土，灌溉了社会主义—共产主义的鲜花。
    年仅二十四岁就英勇牺牲了的陈辉烈士曾经写道：
    我的生命
    被敌人撕碎，
    然而我的血肉呵，
    它将
    化作芬芳的花朵，
    开在你的路上。
          ——“献诗——为伊甸园而歌”
    在埋着我的骨骼的黄土堆上，
    也将有鲜红的花儿生长。
                ——“为祖国而歌”
    是的，烈士同志们，全中国的每条路上，每堆土上，今天都生长着无数鲜艳的爱情的花、幸福的花、自由的花。让烈士们安息吧！我们永远纪念他们，向他们学习。在党和毛主席的领导下，在烈士们的鼓舞下，我们当更加鼓足干劲，来建设我们伟大的美丽的祖国，以继承烈士们未竟的遗志。正如殷夫烈士所写的：
    让死者死去吧，
    他们的血不会白流……
    他们尽了责任，
    我们还要抖擞。
    让我们全党全民、同心同德、团结一致，按照党中央和毛主席所指示的方向，逐步实现近百年来中国志士仁人们的伟大理想，革命先烈们的伟大理想，保卫我们得来不易的革命果实，保卫我们人民的自由幸福，保卫持久的和平吧！
