    Tent School
    On the grasslands of Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province, a tent school has appeared – the Gannan Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School. This school was established in the context of the great development of animal husbandry production.
    The Gannan Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School is located on the Dongkana Grassland of the Yuejin People's Commune in De'uru City. The vast majority of students are Tibetan young men and women commune members from the Yuejin People's Commune. The teachers of the school are animal husbandry and veterinary work cadres transferred from the commune and various counties. Most of the medical equipment used for teaching is from the original veterinary equipment. Currently, the school offers three courses: politics, culture, and livestock disease prevention and quarantine. In terms of professional courses, the school has implemented the policy of combining theory with practice, and students learn and apply what they learn simultaneously. The commune's pasture is their practice ground. They are both students and herdsmen.

    帐篷学校
    在甘肃省甘南藏族自治州草原上，出现了一所帐篷学校——甘南畜牧兽医学校。这所学校是在畜牧业生产大发展的情况下成立的。
    甘南畜牧兽医学校设立在德乌鲁市跃进人民公社的冬卡那草原上，学生绝大多数是跃进人民公社的藏族男女青年社员。学校的教员由公社和各县调来的畜牧兽医工作干部担任。教学使用的医药设备，大都利用原来的兽医设备。目前学校设有政治、文化、牲畜疫病预防和检疫三门课程。学校在业务课方面贯彻了理论联系实际的方针，学生们边学边用。公社牧场就是他们的实习场所。他们既是学生，又是牧民。
