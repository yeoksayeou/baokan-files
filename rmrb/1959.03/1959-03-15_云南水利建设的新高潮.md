A New Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction in Yunnan
Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, Zhang Chong

A new upsurge in water conservancy construction has formed in Yunnan Province. At present, people of all ethnic groups are using soaring revolutionary vigor to meet the requirements of higher work efficiency, better quality, and earlier completion. Up to now, the province has completed 28 large and medium-sized projects and 20,000 small projects, with over 200 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, accounting for two-fifths of the annual earth and stone work plan. Except for a few perennial construction projects, this year's water conservancy construction tasks will be successfully completed by the end of March.

Yunnan's natural characteristic is untimely rainfall. May is the time when the ground temperature is highest and most suitable for crop growth. But at this time, it happens to be the time when it does not rain for more than half a year, rivers are cut off, and ponds and dams are dry. More than 70% of the annual rainfall of about 1,000 millimeters is concentrated in July, August, and September. Because Yunnan is high in mountains and steep in slopes, floods come and go quickly, and water is not easy to store. If water is not captured in the first year, food cannot be captured in the second year. Last year, although Yunnan Province built more than 200 large and medium-sized projects and more than 400,000 small projects, with an irrigation area of 15 million mu, it overcame the drought and ensured a bumper harvest, but it still could not meet the needs of agricultural production. If we encounter the drought situation like in 1958, each mu of paddy field needs 700 to 800 cubic meters of water, and especially dry areas and double-cropping rice areas need 1,000 cubic meters; irrigated land also needs more than 400 to 500 cubic meters. Calculated on the basis of 25 million mu of paddy fields and 20 million mu of irrigated land in the province, the water demand is about 30 billion cubic meters. Before liberation, Yunnan had only about 1 billion cubic meters of water. In the past few years since liberation, it has increased by more than 6 billion cubic meters. If we build another 7 billion cubic meters this year, it will still be less than half of the required water volume. In this way, water conservancy construction is the basic key to developing agriculture in our province in the current and for a considerable period of time to come, and it must be carried out unremittingly until the arid situation is fundamentally changed. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee determined that in the next few years, water conservancy construction must be listed as one of the fundamental measures for developing agricultural production. According to the central government's water conservancy construction policy of focusing on storage, small scale, and community management, and based on several years of water management experience, especially the water conservancy construction experience of last year, the Provincial Party Committee proposed the six major integration principles for water management in the Yunnan Plateau: integrating overall planning, comprehensive utilization, and gradual construction; integrating large, medium, and small sizes, with medium size as the main focus; integrating permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary, with permanent as the main focus; integrating gravity irrigation and lift irrigation, with gravity irrigation as the main focus; integrating surface water and groundwater, with surface water as the main focus; and integrating major spring irrigation and minor spring irrigation, with major spring irrigation as the main focus.

The central link of water management in Yunnan lies in water storage, with permanent medium-sized water storage projects as the main focus. If only some small-scale water conservancy projects irrigating a few mu or dozens of mu are built, and some medium-sized backbone projects are not actively built (the medium-sized water conservancy projects referred to here should actually be included in the scope of the small-sized projects referred to by the central government), we will inevitably be threatened by drought every year and cannot guarantee a bumper harvest. In the central and northern regions of Yunnan, the terrain is mostly four mountains surrounding a dam. If medium-sized reservoirs are built in these mountain valley basins to store water, it will play a decisive role in irrigation, flood control, and ensuring increased agricultural production. In the southern low-lying areas with more rain and long-flowing water, in addition to building necessary backbone projects, it is appropriate to vigorously develop small-scale water conservancy, combining diversion and storage, and the method of storing water like melons growing on vines, which requires less work and has great benefits, seeing benefits quickly. Although the water conservancy construction last year achieved brilliant results, due to late start, strong momentum of the movement, and excessive concentration of labor, it affected the production of the year to a certain extent in some areas. In order to make this year's agricultural production more comprehensively leap forward, it is completely necessary to make water conservancy construction more closely serve this year's agricultural production while focusing on concentrated fertilizer accumulation. The labor force used in the province's water conservancy projects has now been adjusted, and various projects have also been appropriately arranged. The finishing projects of last year and this year's projects with less earthwork and more water storage, which can benefit from both construction and storage, will be resolutely completed before the spring plowing at the end of March. Those that will not benefit this year or are large in scale and difficult to complete before the flood season will be included in the phased construction. As a result of the scheduling, the earth and stone work of the province has decreased compared to last year, but the water storage has increased compared to last year. In this way, we can concentrate our forces on key projects, effectively guarantee progress and quality, and practically increase irrigation this year, so as to meet the Provincial Party Committee's requirements for high-speed growth of grain and cash crops this year. The remaining projects have more adequate preparation time, so that all projects can proceed smoothly. The practice of water conservancy construction in the past few years, especially last year, has proved that although some projects store a lot of water, the labor required is too much, thus affecting the production of the year. Now we are adopting the method of one-time planning and phased heightening, which can both test the consolidation degree of the project and appropriately handle the flood flow according to the actual water demand.

The people's commune has brought about a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in water conservancy construction and solved the most thorny issues of land occupation and immigration in the past. Water conservancy projects can be built as large as they should be and where they should be built, fully demonstrating the superiority of communization. Therefore, most of this year's projects have chosen terrains with large bellies and small mouths, less earthwork and more water, and less labor and greater benefits, so as to maximize the use of favorable terrains and water resources. Rongfeng County built the Dongtun Reservoir with a water storage capacity of 21 million cubic meters, occupying only more than 2,000 mu of land. The Dongtun Commune relocated more than 200 households without spending a penny from the state. Ruili County built six large and medium-sized projects with a water storage capacity of 95 million cubic meters and irrigating 190,000 mu, with a planned earth and stone work of 2.15 million cubic meters, one cubic meter of earth for forty-two cubic meters of water. The water conservancy projects in various places generally choose favorable terrains with low cost and high efficiency, doing it early, skillfully, and well. The ratio of earthwork to water is more cost-effective than last year. Last year, one cubic meter of earth exchanged for five or six cubic meters of water, while this year, one cubic meter of earth exchanges for more than ten cubic meters of water.

This year, our province has a large task, short time, and less labor for water conservancy construction. In order to complete this arduous task, on the premise of ensuring quality, by recalling and comparing, carefully calculating, and mobilizing the masses, a mass-based friendship competition movement of comparing progress and quality with high work efficiency was universally launched. The migrant workers sang like this: "Magpies are chirping on the branches, more reservoirs are built than homes, we work together and work hard, and only go home with red flowers." In order to complete the project before spring plowing and give full play to its benefits in time, and to allow more labor to be invested in spring plowing, we also insisted on putting politics in command, repeatedly criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas with the spirit of continuous revolution, cadres and the masses eat, live, and work together, personally go deep into the construction site to engage in high work efficiency "experimental fields," establish models, and promote them in a timely manner. Continuous inspection and evaluation are carried out, and methods such as on-site meetings, performance meetings, celebration, commendation, and awards are used to ensure that everyone strives to be the best and that red flags are inserted in everything. The leading comrades of the Qiaojia County Party Committee went deep into the Red Flag Reservoir to cultivate a high work efficiency "experimental field." After improving the labor organization, rationally using labor, mobilizing the masses, improving tools, and innovating technology, the average work efficiency was increased from one cubic meter of earth per person per day to six cubic meters. The County Party Committee held an on-site meeting in a timely manner to exchange experience, which quickly made the work efficiency of other reservoirs exceed six cubic meters. In the technological innovation, tool improvement, and promotion of advanced tools, we have also focused on several high work efficiency tools, such as live-bottom, wooden rail, iron rail mine cars, grooves, blasting, cattle plowing for soil, funnel wharf loading, and cattle-drawn stone rollers for compaction, all of which have been vigorously promoted according to local conditions. Make the four links of extraction, loading, transportation, unloading, and compression closely linked, flow operation, mutual promotion, and common achievement of high work efficiency. Practice has proved that as long as we seriously reform tools, make full use of animal power, improve operating methods, and combine practical work with skillful work, work efficiency can be increased several times or even dozens of times.

Political and ideological work must be done conscientiously on the construction site to ensure the supply of materials, care for the lives of migrant workers, ensure that migrant workers eat well and sleep well, and pay attention to carrying out cultural and recreational activities. In this way, we can achieve well-trained soldiers and sufficient food, strong people and horses, happy mood, and continuous increase in work efficiency. Many migrant workers at the construction site reflected, "The construction site is really good, let us wholeheartedly want to compete." This is the voice of the migrant workers on our water conservancy construction site. Let us put in greater effort and make the upsurge of water conservancy construction in Yunnan even higher!

    云南水利建设的新高潮
    云南省副省长  张冲
    云南省的水利建设已形成一个新的高潮。现在各族人民正以冲天革命干劲来达到工效更高、质量更好、完工更早的要求。到目前为止，全省已完成大、中型工程二十八件，小型工程二万件，土石方两亿多公方，占全年土石方计划的五分之二。除少数常年施工的工程外，3月底将能胜利地完成今年的水利建设任务。
    云南的自然特点是降雨不及时。5月份地温最高，最适于作物成长。但这个时候，恰恰是半年多不下雨，河水断流、塘坝枯竭的时日。全年一千公厘左右的雨量，70％以上都集中在7、8、9月。由于云南山高坡陡，因而洪水来得猛，去得快，水不容易蓄住，头年抓不住水，第二年就抓不住粮。去年云南省虽然兴修了大中型工程二百多件，小型工程四十多万件，灌溉面积达一千五百万亩，战胜了干旱，保证了大丰收，但仍不能满足农业生产的需要。如果遇到像1958年的干旱情况，水田每亩需水七百至八百公方，特别干旱和种双季稻的地区，要一千公方；水浇地也需要有四百至五百公方以上。全省以二千五百万亩水田、二千万亩水浇地计算，约需水量三百亿公方。解放前云南只有十来亿公方水，解放几年来增加六十多亿，今年再修七十多亿，也还不到所需水量的一半。如此看来，在当前和今后相当长的一段时期内，水利建设是我省发展农业的基本关键，必须坚韧不拔地进行到底，直到根本改变干旱面貌为止。因此，省委确定：在最近几年内，必须把水利建设列为发展农业生产的根本措施之一。省委根据中央以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主的水利建设方针，并根据几年来的治水经验，特别是去年的水利建设经验，提出了云南高原地区治水六大结合的原则：以全面规划，综合利用，与逐步施工相结合；大中小型相结合，以中型为主；永久性、半永久性与临时性相结合，以永久性为主；自流灌溉与提水灌溉相结合，以自流灌溉为主；地上水与地下水相结合，以地上水为主；大春灌溉与小春灌溉相结合，以大春灌溉为主。
    云南治水的中心环节在于蓄水，并以永久性的中型蓄水工程为主。如果只修一些灌溉几亩几十亩的小型水利，而不积极兴修一些中型骨干工程（这里所指的中型水利工程，实际上应包括在中央所指的小型工程范围以内），势必年年被旱灾所威胁，而不能保证丰收。在云南中部和北部地区，地形多四山夹一坝，如果在这些山谷盆地筑中型水库蓄水，则对灌溉、防洪，保证农业增产，将起决定性的作用。在南部地势低洼，雨水多长流水，除兴修必要骨干工程外，宜于大力开展小型水利，引蓄结合长藤结瓜的蓄水方法，费工少，收效大。吹糠见米，当年受益。去年水利建设，虽则获得了光辉的成绩，但由于动手迟，运动来势猛，劳力过分集中，在某些地区一定程度上影响了当年生产。为了使今年农业生产更全面地跃进，在突击积肥为中心的同时，使水利建设更紧密地为当年农业生产服务则是完全必要的。现在全省水利工程所用的劳力已经进行了调整，各项工程也作了适当的安排。去年的扫尾工程和今年的土方少、水方多，能边修边蓄当年得益的工程，坚决在3月底春耕前完工，对今年不受益或者规模较大洪水前很难完工的就列入分期施工。排队的结果，全省土石方比去年减少，但水方却比去年增多。这样，既能在重点工程上集中力量，切实保证进度和质量，又能实际增加当年灌溉，达到省委今年粮食和经济作物高速度增长的要求。其余一部分工程又有了比较充分的准备时间，使所有工程都能顺利地进展。几年来，特别是去年水利建设的实践证明，有些工程虽然蓄水多，但所需劳力过多，因而影响了当年的生产。现在我们采取一次规划、分年加高的办法，既能考验工程的巩固程度，又能根据实际用水的需要，恰当地处理洪水流量。
    人民公社化给水利建设带来了更大更好更全面跃进的局面，并解决了过去最棘手的占地和移民问题，水利工程该修多大就修多大，该修在哪里就修在哪里，充分显示了公社化的优越性。所以今年的工程多半选择了肚大、口小，土方少、水方多、花工少、受益大的地形，以最大限度地利用有利地形和水利资源。榕峰县修东屯水库蓄水二千一百万公方，仅占地二千多亩。东屯公社不用国家一文钱就迁移了两百多户人家；瑞丽县修大中型工程六件，蓄水九千五百万公方，灌溉十九万亩，计划土石方二百一十五万公方，一方土，四十二公方水。各地水利工程一般都选择了费用省、效用大的有利地形，干得早，干得巧，干得好，土方与水方的比例较去年更合算，去年一方土换五、六方水，今年一方土换十多方水。
    今年我省水利建设任务大，时间短，劳力少，为了完成这项艰巨的任务，在保证质量的前提下，通过回忆对比，算细账，发动群众，普遍地掀起了一个群众性的比进度、比质量的高工效友谊竞赛运动。民工们这样地歌唱：“喜鹊枝头叫喳喳，多挂水库不挂家，齐心合力加油干，戴上红花才回家。”为了使工程赶在春耕前完工，及时发挥效益，又能让更多劳力投入春耕，还坚持了政治挂帅，以不断革命的精神，反复批判右倾保守思想，干部与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，亲自深入工地搞高工效“试验田”，树立典型，及时推广。不断的进行检查评比，运用现场会、表演会、庆功、表扬、颁奖等办法，做到人人争上游、事事插红旗。中共巧家县委的领导同志深入红旗水库培养高工效“试验田”，经过改进劳动组织，合理使用劳力，发动群众，改良工具，革新技术，平均工效由原来每人每天一方土提高到六方。县委及时召开现场会，交流经验，很快使其他水库的工效也超过了六方。在技术革新、改良工具、推广先进工具中，我们又着重抓住了几种高工效工具，如滚珠轴承化的活底、木轨、铁轨矿车、沟槽、爆破、牛犁取土、漏斗码头上土、牛拉石滚碾压等都因地制宜地狠狠加以推广。使取、装、运、卸、压几个环节，环环扣紧，流水作业，互相促进，共同达到了高工效。实践证明，只要认真改革工具，充分利用畜力，改进操作方法，实干和巧干结合，工效就能几倍几十倍地提高。
    在工地上要认真做好政治思想工作，保证物资供应，关心民工生活，保证民工吃饱、睡好，注意开展文化娱乐活动。这样，就能做到兵精粮足，人强马壮，心情舒畅，工效不断上升。不少工地民工反映，“工地真好，让我们一心只想竞赛。”这就是我们水利工地上民工们的声音。让我们拿出更大的干劲，使云南的水利建设高潮更高吧！
