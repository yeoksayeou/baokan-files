Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 6th. The "High Authority" of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" group held a meeting lasting approximately ten hours from the 4th to the 5th. The meeting decided to declare a "clear state of crisis" in the Western European coal market, because 45 million tons of coal have already been stockpiled on the mines. This inventory is equivalent to more than three-quarters of France's 1958 production. Fina, chairman of the "Coal and Steel Community" group, confirmed the above news at a press conference held yesterday. The decision to declare a state of crisis will only take effect after it is passed by a majority vote by the group's Council of Ministers at a meeting on March 23.

Taking this measure will obligate the six group member states, including France, to reduce coal production; that is, to cause more miners to lose their jobs. At the same time, member states can also reduce coal imports from other member states.

The "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group assured that the miners who are unemployed will receive "assistance." However, the miners of Borinage in Belgium, as well as the workers in France who lost their jobs due to mine closures after joining the Community, have personally experienced that the group's promise of "assistance" will never be fulfilled. In addition, the "Coal and Steel Community" group also forced the French government to raise the export price of steel by 4%.

The French General Confederation of Labor's Coal Miners Federation protested extremely angrily against the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group's decision to declare the coal industry in a "state of crisis."

The Coal Miners Federation recently called on miners to demand the restoration of a 40-hour work week without reducing wages, and once again demanded immediate withdrawal from the "Coal and Steel Community" group.

The union called on all French miners to mobilize, hold demonstrations in mines and service locations, and send their resolutions to Paris, and send delegations to Paris to protest the decision of the "High Authority" of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" group.

    西欧“煤钢联营”景况不妙
    决定宣布煤炭市场陷入危机
    将迫使各成员国降低煤的产量
    新华社巴黎6日电　西欧“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”在4日至5日的夜间召开了一次约十小时的会议，会议决定宣布西欧煤炭市场出现“明显的危机状态”，因为在这个市场内，已经有四千五百万吨煤堆积在矿山上。这批存货相当于1958年法国产量的四分之三以上。“煤钢联营”集团主席菲纳在昨天举行的记者招待会上证实了上述消息。宣布危机状态的决定要在3月23日开会的该集团部长理事会以多数通过后才能生效。
    采取这项措施将使包括法国在内的六个集团成员国承担义务降低煤产量；也就是说，使更多的矿工失业。同时，各成员国也可以减少从其他成员国进口的煤。
      “煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”保证说，遭到失业的矿工将得到“援助”。但是，比利时波里纳吉的矿工以及在法国加入联营集团后因矿井关闭而失业的工人们，都已经亲身体验到：这个集团的关于“援助”的诺言是永远不会兑现的。此外“煤钢联营”集团还强迫法国政府把出口的钢价提高4％。
    法国总工会煤矿工人联合会极其愤怒地抗议“煤钢联营”集团“高级机构”的关于宣布煤业处于
  “危机状态”的决定。
    煤矿工人联合会不久前曾经号召矿工们要求在不降低工资的条件下恢复每周四十小时工作制，同时再一次要求立即退出“煤钢联营”集团。
    这个工会号召法国的矿工全体总动员，在矿井和服务场所举行示威，并且把他们通过的决议送到巴黎，把代表团派到巴黎，抗议西欧“煤钢联营”集团“高级机构”的决定。
