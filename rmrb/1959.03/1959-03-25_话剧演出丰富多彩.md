Theatrical performances are rich and varied

(Our report) The spring of 1959 is witnessing an even more flourishing scene in the national drama art. In Beijing and Shanghai alone, new dramas reflecting real life, such as "Tempered Steel," "A Revolutionary Family," "The Shop Assistant," "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains," "Rising Sun," and "Underground Young Pioneers," have been staged successively. Dramas that are being rehearsed or are about to be rehearsed cover a wide range of subjects, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern. These include "Taming the Dragon and Subduing the Tiger," which depicts the support of mountain people for iron and steel production; "Three People," which describes the ideological transformation of intellectuals; Guo Moruo's new historical drama "Cai Wenji"; and foreign classics such as "The Miser" and "The Storm." Dramas such as "Red Storm," "Daring to Think and Act," "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and "White Egret," which were popular with audiences last year, are still being staged in rotation after continuous refinement. Traditional Chinese and foreign classics such as "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm," "Beautiful Woman," "Nora," and "Shakuntala" are also reappearing on the stage. Currently, the theatrical community is working hard to further improve performance levels in order to better meet the growing needs of audiences for drama.

China's drama undertaking has developed year by year. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Culture in September 1958, there are already 149 professional drama troupes nationwide, spread across provinces, cities, military units, and trade union systems, with the number of professional drama workers increasing by more than 20% compared to 1953. In recent years, drama has mainly performed modern dramas and a large number of world-renowned dramas, thus winning more and more audiences. At present, most troupes have more than ten repertoire plays that can be restaged.

In 1958, with literature and art serving politics and production, theatrical performances flourished unprecedentedly. The number of scripts created basically met the needs of various performance forms, and many excellent dramas emerged. "Drama News" alone recommended and introduced more than forty multi-act plays, including those reflecting the current real struggle, such as "Daring to Think and Act" and "Fiery Red Heart," which describe breaking superstitions and making inventions; "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir Rhapsody," which expresses the spirit of communism; "Song of Youth," which describes the ideological transformation of intellectuals; the topical satire "Paper Tiger Exposed," which closely coordinates with the international situation; and "Red Storm," "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," which depict the revolutionary historical struggle, and the outstanding historical drama "Guan Hanqing" also appeared.

    话剧演出丰富多彩
    本报讯　1959年的春天，全国话剧艺术显露出更加繁荣的景象。仅北京、上海陆续上演的就有“百炼成钢”、“革命的一家”、“女店员”、“三千里江山”、“旭日东升”、“地下少先队”等反映现实生活的新剧目。正在排演和将要排演的话剧，还有中外古今多种题材。如表现山区人民支援钢铁生产的“降龙伏虎”；有描写知识分子思想改造的“三人行”；有郭沫若的新作历史剧“蔡文姬”，还有外国名剧“悭吝人”、“大雷雨”等等。去年受到观众欢迎的剧目“红色风暴”、“敢想敢做的人”、“把一切献给党”、“白鹭”等，经过不断加工仍在轮换上演。“日出”、“雷雨”、“丽人行”、“娜拉”、“沙恭达罗”等中外传统名剧也重现舞台。目前话剧界正在进一步努力提高表演水平，要更好地满足观众对话剧日益增长的需要。
    我国话剧事业逐年有所发展，据文化部1958年9月不完整的统计：全国专业话剧团体已有一百四十九个，遍布全国各省市、部队和工会系统，专业话剧工作者较1953年增加了20％多。几年来，由于话剧主要演出现代剧目，并大量上演世界各国名剧，因而赢得了愈来愈多的观众。目前一般剧团都有十余个能够重新上演的保留剧目。
    1958年，随着文艺为政治、生产服务，话剧演出空前繁荣，剧本创作数量基本上能满足多种演出形式的需要，并涌现了许多优秀剧目，仅“戏剧报”推荐介绍的多幕剧就有四十多个，其中反映当前现实斗争的，有描写破除迷信、发明创造的“敢想敢做的人”、“烈火红心”；有表现共产主义精神面貌的“十三陵水库畅想曲”；有描写知识分子思想改造的“青春之歌”；有密切配合国际形势的时事讽刺剧“纸老虎现形记”，还有表现革命历史斗争的“红色风暴”、“把一切献给党”、
  “智取威虎山”等剧，并出现了优秀的历史剧“关汉卿”等。（附图片）
