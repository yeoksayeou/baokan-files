    The Versatile Tail
    Xiao Yuan
    When a cat jumps onto a fence, we see its tail swaying left and right, just like the long pole held by an acrobat walking on a tightrope, playing a balancing role. The same is true for a fox when it climbs a steep hillside. A fox can swim, and in the water, its tail becomes a rudder.
    Considering the ratio of body to tail, the jerboa has the longest tail. Its body is only about three inches long, but its tail is about five inches long, almost twice its body length. The jerboa is named for its good jumping ability, and it can jump up to a丈 (zhàng, a Chinese unit of length, approx. 3.3 meters) away. Without its tail, it cannot jump more than three尺 (chǐ, a Chinese unit of length, approx. 0.33 meters). The large kangaroo, which jumps up to three 丈, uses its twenty-斤 (jīn, a Chinese unit of weight, approx. 0.5 kg) tail to control the direction of its jumps. When resting, its thick tail and two hind legs form a "tripod," making it very stable when "sitting." If two kangaroos fight, one can see them sometimes use their tail to support their weight and kick with their hind feet.
    Generally, people think that monkeys can hang upside down from trees with their tails, but most monkeys do not have this ability. Only some monkeys in South America can do so. Someone has carefully observed the posture of monkeys jumping between treetops in the forest. The monkey first runs a few steps on a thicker branch, then leaps upward, with its "arms" extended to the left and right, and its head thrown forward, just like a swallow-style dive. At this instant, the tail shows its great power: when it is close to another treetop, the long tail swings, turning the body upright and landing safely.
    If the tail provides considerable help to the activities of many animals, the situation of sheep in Asia is not so. Its large, fat tail is clearly a burden when walking, but it can help it overcome the difficulties of lacking water and grass. The large, fat tail is full of fat, like a camel's hump, "storing" food when food is plentiful. The heaviest sheep tails weigh more than ten 斤. Because of it, the speed of travel is greatly reduced. It is said that an impatient shepherd pushed a small cart, closely following the sheep, and put the large, fat tail in the cart to push it along, in order to reduce the burden on the sheep and make it walk faster.

    多能的尾巴
    小元
    猫一跳上篱笆，我们便见它的尾巴忽左忽右，正如杂技团演员走钢丝时手中握的长棍子，起着平衡作用。狐，当它爬上陡峭山坡，尾巴的作用也是与猫的相同。狐会游水，在水中时它的尾巴又成了船舵。
    就躯体与尾巴的比例看，跳鼠的尾巴算是最长的。它身长不过三寸，尾长却达五寸左右，几为体长的两倍。跳鼠正是以其善跳而得名，一跳可达一丈远，去掉了尾巴则跳不出三尺。一跳三丈的大袋鼠，以它的二十斤重的大尾巴来左右跳跃的方向。在休息的时候，它那条粗壮的尾巴和两条后腿呈
  “三足鼎立”之势，“坐”起来很是稳当。如果两只袋鼠打起架来，人们可以看见它们有时用尾支持体重，用后足踢打。
    一般人总以为猴子可以用尾巴把自己倒挂在树上，其实绝大多数的猴类并无此本领，只有某些产在南美的猴子才能如此。有人对猴子在森林中树巅间跳跃的姿势作过仔细的观察。猴子先在一根较粗的枝干上短跑几步，向上腾起，双“臂”左右伸，头向前投去，恰似燕式跳水。就在这一瞬间，尾巴大显神通：当快接近另一树冠时，长尾摆动，使躯干变成垂直正立，安然“着陆”。
    如果说尾巴对许多动物的活动有不小的帮助的话，产在亚洲的绵羊的情况却并非如此。它的肥大的尾巴在走动时，显然是个累赘，但能帮助它度过水草缺乏的困难。肥大的尾巴满是脂肪，好似骆驼的肉峰，在食物充裕时
  “贮存”食物。绵羊的尾巴最重的有十多斤，因为有它，行进的速度大大降低。据说有个性急的牧羊人推着小车，紧跟在绵羊后面，把肥大的尾巴装在车上推着走，以减轻绵羊的负担，使它走快些。
