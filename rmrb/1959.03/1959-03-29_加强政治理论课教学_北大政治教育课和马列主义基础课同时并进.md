Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Peking University has further strengthened the teaching of political theory courses since the new semester began. The university offers both political and ideological education courses closely integrated with various political movements, productive labor, and the students' ideological realities, and also systematically offers basic Marxist-Leninist courses.

This semester, Peking University's political courses include two components. One part is the "Situation and Tasks" course, which all teachers and students participate in, and the other part is the basic Marxist-Leninist theory course. The "Situation and Tasks" course is organized to enable teachers and students to deeply study the situation, tasks, and major principles and policies of the Party in each period, based on the daily study of current affairs policies. Since the beginning of the semester, all teachers and students have completed the first unit of this course: "Recognize the Situation, Boost Enthusiasm, and Strive to Achieve a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward in 1959." Through the study, the teachers' and students' political enthusiasm and drive have been further enhanced. Now, many teachers and students are engaged in work, study, and labor with greater enthusiasm. In terms of basic Marxist-Leninist theory courses, Peking University has opened the "Socialism and Communism" course for first- and second-year students this semester, and dialectical materialism for third-, fourth-, and fifth-year students. Courses such as historical materialism, political economics, and the modern history of the Chinese revolution will be offered successively in the future.

The Peking University Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken a series of measures to improve the teaching quality of political courses. Lu Ping, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, serves as the Director of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Section. The Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Secretaries are responsible for lecturing on various topics in the "Socialism and Communism" course. The general party branches of each department have also designated specific personnel to be responsible for political theory education. Political course teachers also hold certain positions in the Party organizations of each department to deepen their understanding of the masses and closely integrate with the students' ideological realities to carry out political and ideological education. To improve the level of political course teachers, the school is conducting theoretical training for political teachers and organizing teachers to go to factories and rural areas in rotation to conduct research and investigation, so that they can better understand the actual situation.

    加强政治理论课教学
    北大政治教育课和马列主义基础课同时并进
    新华社28日讯　新学期以来，北京大学进一步加强了政治理论课教学。全校既有密切结合各项政治运动、生产劳动和学生思想实际的政治思想教育课，也分别开设了系统的马列主义基础课。
    这学期北京大学的政治课包括两个组成部分。一部分是全校师生都参加学习的形势与任务课，一部分是马列主义基础理论课。形势与任务课是在日常时事政策学习的基础上组织师生深入学习每一时期的形势、任务和党的重大方针、政策。开学以来，全校师生已学完了这门课的第一单元：“认清形势，鼓足干劲，为实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗”。经过学习，进一步提高了师生们的政治热情和干劲，现在，不少师生都在以更高的积极性从事工作、学习和劳动。在马列主义基础理论课方面，北京大学本学期为一、二年级学生开设了“社会主义和共产主义”课，为三、四、五年级学生开设了辩证唯物主义，以后还将陆续开设历史唯物主义、政治经济学、中国现代革命史等课程。
    中共北京大学党委会曾采取了一系列措施提高政治课的教学质量。党委第一书记陆平担任了政治理论教研室主任，党委书记和副书记分别担任了社会主义和共产主义课各专题的讲授。各系的党总支也都指定专人负责政治理论教育工作。政治课教员还兼任了各系党组织的一定工作，以便深入群众，密切联系学生思想实际进行政治思想教育。为了提高政治课教员的水平，学校正在进行政治教员的理论训练，同时组织教师轮流深入工厂、农村进行调查研究工作，使他们更多地了解实际情况。
