    Shipbuilding for the Wujiang River
    The largest river in Guizhou, the Wujiang River, is now fully navigable in its middle reaches. The workers and staff of the Sinan Shipyard have decided to manufacture ten motorized passenger ships and a batch of large wooden barges this year to supply the Wujiang River shipping service.
    This is the "Sinan Red Flag" passenger-cargo tugboat about to be launched.
