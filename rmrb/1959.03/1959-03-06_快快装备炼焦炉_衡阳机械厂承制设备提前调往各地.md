    Speedily Equip Coke Ovens
    Hengyang Machinery Factory Advances Delivery of Equipment to Various Locations
    Changsha, March 5th (reported by this newspaper) - The Hengyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Factory in Hunan Province completed the task of manufacturing 2,900 coke oven equipment sets on February 26th, victoriously fulfilling the challenge conditions that the factory proposed in late January to mechanical factories across the country manufacturing similar equipment. This batch of coke oven equipment was not only completed two days ahead of the time stipulated by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, but also passed strict inspection, with the quality fully meeting the standards. Currently, most of the coke oven equipment has been transported to various parts of the country, and the remainder is being shipped.
    After receiving the task of manufacturing 2,900 coke oven equipment sets including blowers, water pumps, and electric motors in late January, all the factory's employees were filled with enthusiasm, determined to complete the task ahead of schedule. All employees unanimously passed a guarantee letter to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and proposed six conditions to launch a friendly competition with fraternal factories across the country manufacturing similar equipment. Immediately afterwards, red flag competitions were launched in various workshops. The wood mold workshop, which was responsible for the first process, completed four days' worth of work in thirty hours. Focusing on speeding up, saving raw materials, and ensuring quality, this workshop innovated many operating techniques in one day, some of which increased efficiency by ten to thirty-two times. After the cast iron workshop workers received the models, each team raced against time, constantly improving output. The non-ferrous class, which cast the cooling fans for the motors, made ninety pieces on the first day, and then implemented assembly line operations on the second day, increasing production to two hundred and fifty pieces. The remaining one hundred and sixty pieces were completed in just three and a half hours on the third day. The riveting and welding workshop used the method of "welding instead of riveting" to weld the impellers of the blowers, which not only reduced three procedures and a large amount of man-hours, but also saved 140,000 rivets. The technical section employees changed the design of the water pump casing while ensuring quality, which not only guaranteed quality, but also saved a lot of raw materials. In the process of rushing to manufacture coke oven equipment, all the factory's employees carried out more than 8,100 technical innovations and creations, which played a great role in completing the task ahead of schedule.
    Although the task of rushing to manufacture coke oven equipment was heavy and the time was short, the Party committee of the Hengyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Factory attached great importance to product quality. The produced electric motors lacked type test equipment, so heavy-load tests were carried out without any carelessness. Initially, one hundred and four electric motors had already been packed and were scheduled to be shipped the next day. Although operational tests had already been carried out, the Party committee, in order to be cautious, opened the boxes and conducted heavy-load tests again. Finally, it was confirmed that the quality met the specifications before they were allowed to leave the factory. (Photo attached)

    快快装备炼焦炉
    衡阳机械厂承制设备提前调往各地
    本报长沙5日电　湖南省衡阳冶金机械修造厂在2月26日完成制造二千九百台炼焦设备的任务，胜利地实现了这个厂在1月下旬向全国各地制造同类设备的机械厂提出的挑战竞赛条件。这批炼焦设备不仅比冶金工业部规定的时间提前两天完成，而且经过严格的检查，质量完全合乎标准。目前大多数炼焦设备已运往全国各地，其余的也正在启运中。
    这个厂在1月下旬接到制造二千九百台鼓风机、水泵、电动机等炼焦设备的任务以后，全厂职工干劲冲天，决心把这个任务提前完成。全体职工一致通过了向冶金部提出的保证书，并提出六项条件向全国制造同类设备的兄弟工厂发起友谊竞赛。紧接着，各车间就展开了红旗竞赛。担负第一道工序的木模车间，在三十个小时内就干完了四天的活。这个车间以加快速度、节约原材料和保证质量为中心，在一天之内，就革新了很多项操作技术，其中有的提高工效十倍到三十二倍。铸铁车间工人得到模型后，各班组也分秒必争，不断提高产量。有色班铸造马达降温的风扇，第一天造九十个，第二天实行流水作业，就提高到二百五十个，剩下的一百六十个，在第三天就只花三个半小时完成了。铆焊车间运用“以焊代铆”的方法，焊接鼓风机的叶轮，不仅使这项操作减少三道工序，减少大量的工时，还节省了十四万颗铆钉。技术科职工在保证质量的前提下，改变了水泵外壳的设计，既保证质量，又节省了很多原材料。在赶制炼焦设备过程中，全厂职工共进行了八千一百多项技术革新和创造，对提前完成任务起了很大作用。
    衡阳冶金机械修造厂这次赶制炼焦设备，虽然任务重、时间短，但这个厂的党委对产品质量非常重视。生产出来的电动机，缺乏型式试验设备，便进行重负荷试验，一点也不马虎。开始时，有一百零四台电动机已经装箱，第二天就要启运，虽然已经进行过运转试验，党委为了慎重起见，又开箱进行重负荷试验，最后证实质量合乎规格，才允许出厂。（附图片）
