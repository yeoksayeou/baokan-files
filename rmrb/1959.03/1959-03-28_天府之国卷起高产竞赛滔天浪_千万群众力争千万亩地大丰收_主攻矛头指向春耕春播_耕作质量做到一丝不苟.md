    The Land of Abundance Rolls Up a Towering Wave of High-Yield Competition
    Tens of Millions of People Strive for a Great Harvest on Tens of Millions of Mu of Land
    The Main Attack Points to Spring Plowing and Sowing
    Cultivation Quality is Impeccable
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 27th) The spring of March sees competition surge like a tidal wave across the thousand-mile basin of Sichuan. The grand and magnificent movement of large-scale high-yield fields on tens of millions of mu has been launched throughout the province. More than 12 million mu of land in the province are participating in the large-scale high-yield competition, accounting for about one-seventh of the province's grain cultivated land area, and 20 million people are involved in the movement, accounting for about one-third of the province's agricultural population.
    High-yield competition is a great driving force. Driven by the competition, the upsurge of agricultural production in the province is rising higher and higher. While continuing to manage wheat and rapeseed, the tens of millions of labor force active in the fields are focusing the spearhead of the spring offensive on spring plowing and sowing. From both sides of the Yangtze River to the foot of the Daba Mountains, in the fertile dams, on the wet mountain tops, and in the mirror-like paddy fields, a tense battle of plowing, harrowing, accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, and sowing is taking place everywhere. Leading cadres at all levels take the lead and rush to the front lines of production. In Fushun County, 19,000 county, district, and commune cadres, with their bedding, farm tools, and telephones, settled down near the high-yield fields of the Fengchan Dam, Fengchan Road, and Fengchan Bay. They eat, live, and work with the masses, conduct on-the-spot command, and promptly summarize experience, rapidly spreading advanced technology to various places, making the sowing work fast and good.
    In the competition, all localities pay special attention to quality and standards. In order to win a greater harvest of 800,000 mu of early rice in the Jiangjin Special District and ensure the quality of spring sowing, many communes have held spring sowing demonstration performances at different levels, setting off a "seven-good" competition of deep soil, weed-free, mud-like, level fields, abundant fertilizer, improved varieties, and even sowing. During the blitz sowing in Luochang Commune, Gao County, they checked while sowing. After they combined layered fertilization and finished plowing and sowing 139 mu of seedling fields, they found after inspection that the fertilizer applied to one-tenth of a mu of seedling fields was not up to standard. Everyone said: "A tall building rises from the ground; quality cannot be sloppy." So they did not sow until enough fertilizer was applied.
    All localities are filled with friendship and care in the competition. In Baishan People's Commune, Cangxi County, which is more than 1,200 meters above sea level, plowing was started earlier this year in order to plow and harrow more. Early in the morning, when the ground was still covered with frost, everyone began to plow the winter water fields. When female cadre Shen Wenying was about to roll up her trouser legs to go to the fields, production captain Li Quande stopped her and said, "You keep saying you want to take care of the special difficulties of women, but you don't take care of yourself!" Li Quande had just plowed a few rows in the field when commune member Xing Kaiyuan snatched the plow from him and asked him to go ashore to warm himself by the fire. Captain Li gave him the plow he was using and added another plow to compete with him. In this atmosphere of love, the whole commune plowed 1,200 mu of high-yield rice fields in three days.
    Learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping each other, and leaping forward together are the greatest characteristics of the competition movement. In order to learn from the high-yield rapeseed experience of Zhong County, Deyang, Xindu, Pixian, Mianyang, and other counties have regularly sent working groups to the high-yield areas of rapeseed in Zhong County. While working and learning cultivation techniques together with the local commune members, they also study problems, summarize experiences, and promptly write letters and telegrams to report to their counties. Xindu County, which is competing with Zhong County for high-yield rapeseed, has accepted Zhong County's experience of doing finer and finer late-stage management of rapeseed, achieving fertilization according to the seedlings, and checking management to the plants. On the basis of generally topdressing seven or eight times, special "small stoves" are also set up for a few third-class seedlings to give the rapeseed a "feast," making the 50,000 mu of rapeseed in the county grow particularly well. Jianyang County, which once achieved high cotton yields, specially selected more than 200 production experts during cotton sowing, carrying 300,000 jin of improved cotton varieties to Luzhou, Longchang, Wenjiang, and other twelve counties and cities to teach advanced technology and help them from planting to harvesting.
    The competition becomes more intense and enthusiastic as it goes down to the grassroots level. In many places, there is a situation of soldiers facing each other and conducting on-the-spot competitions. When the production teams of the Uyang District People's Commune in Zhong County carried out on-the-spot competitions between slopes and gullies in close proximity, competitions were also carried out between groups and individuals within each team. They used the method of "issuing battle charts at sunrise and looking at the results at sunset" based on each day's production work and measures, combining long-term plans and short-term arrangements with the specific production activities of the commune members every day. In order to strengthen mutual inspection, the teams of the Ruxi Commune also sent inspectors to reside in each other's teams, so that the production of each production team could be developed in a balanced manner through mutual supervision.
    The reason why Sichuan's high-yield competition movement can develop rapidly and healthily is first and foremost because the movement's goals are clear, concentrating on reflecting the masses' desire for higher and higher agricultural yields, and inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for production. Second, leaders at all levels walk in front of the movement, support the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and from the first secretary of the provincial party committee to the secretaries of party committees at all levels, they personally go to the front line, promptly solve problems such as ideology, measures, and material preparation, and firmly grasp the leadership of the movement. Third, the competition plan has been repeatedly discussed by the masses, and the measures are relatively specific. Not only are all high-yield lands selected in drought and flood-proof, fertile Fengchan dams, gullies, slopes, and places with convenient transportation, but they also adopt the method of concentrated planting, centralized production, and special management, and establish technical pacesetters through the experimental fields of cadres. Fourth, according to the principle of overall planning and ensuring key points, the superior labor force is concentrated on the agricultural front in a timely manner, ensuring that the upsurge of agricultural production continues to advance wave after wave.

    天府之国卷起高产竞赛滔天浪
    千万群众力争千万亩地大丰收
    主攻矛头指向春耕春播
    耕作质量做到一丝不苟
    本报成都27日电　阳春三月，四川千里盆地竞赛浪潮汹涌滔天。宏伟壮阔的千万亩大面积高产田竞赛运动，已在全省开展起来。全省参加大面积高产竞赛的土地已达一千二百多万亩，约占全省粮食耕地面积的七分之一，卷入运动的群众达两千万人，约占全省农业人口三分之一。
    高产竞赛是一个伟大的动力。在竞赛推动下，全省农业生产高潮越涌越高。在再接再厉管好小麦油菜的同时，活跃在田野上的千万劳动大军，正把春季攻势的矛头集中向春耕播种。从长江两岸到大巴山下，肥沃的坝地里，湿漉漉的山头上，平整如镜的水田里，到处都在紧张地进行着犁田、耙地、积肥、送粪、播种的战斗。各级领导干部身先士卒，奔赴生产前线。富顺县有一万九千名县、区、社干部，带着被盖、农具和电话机到丰产坝、丰产路、丰产湾的高产田附近安家落户。他们与群众同吃同住同劳动，并就地进行现场指挥，及时总结经验，把先进技术迅速传播各地，使播种工作进行得又快又好。
    各地在竞赛中特别注意质量和规格。江津专区为夺取八十万亩早稻更大丰收，保证春播质量，许多公社都分级举行了春播示范表演，掀起土深、无草、泥绒、田平、肥多、良种、播匀的七好竞赛。高县罗昌公社在突击播种中边播边检查。当他们结合分层施肥，翻整播种完一百三十九亩秧田后，经检查，发现有一分秧田肥料施的不够标准，大家说：万丈高楼从地起，质量可不能马虎一点，于是直到施足肥料再行播种。
    各地在竞赛中，充满着友谊和关怀。苍溪县拔海一千二百多公尺的白山人民公社，为进行多犁多耙，今年犁田特别提早。清晨地面还撒着白霜，大家就开始耕犁冬水田。妇女干部沈文英正要卷起裤脚下田，生产队长李全德挡住她说：“你天天讲要照顾妇女特殊困难，就不照顾你自己呀！”李全德下田刚犁了几趟，又被社员邢开元把犁夺过来，换他上岸烤火。李队长把自己使的犁头让他，自己另外添了个犁头，和他搞开了竞赛。就在这种友爱的气氛中，全社三天犁完了一千二百多亩水稻高产田。
    学先进、赶先进，相互帮助、共同跃进，是竞赛运动的最大特色。为学习忠县油菜高产经验，德阳、新都、郫县、绵阳等县都经常派有工作组驻在忠县油菜的高产区里，他们一面与当地社员共同劳动、学习培育技术，同时研究问题，总结经验，及时写信发电报告诉本县。和忠县进行油菜高产竞赛的新都县，接受忠县油菜后期管理愈做愈细的经验，做到因苗施肥，管理检查到株，在普遍追肥七、八次的基础上，对少数三类苗还特别设立“小灶”，给油菜打“牙祭”，使全县五万亩油菜生长特别良好。曾获棉花高产的简阳县在棉花播种中特别选拔了二百多个生产能手，带着三十万斤棉花良种，到泸州、隆昌、温江等十二个县市传授先进技术，从种到收，帮助到底。
    竞赛越到基层，就越是紧张热烈，许多地方都出现了兵马相峙，现场比武的局面，忠县乌羊区各人民公社生产队，在开展坡与坡、沟与沟近距离的现场竞赛时，各队中也开展了组与组、人与人之间的竞赛。他们根据当天的每项生产活路和措施，采用“日出发战表，日落看战果”的方法，使长计划、短安排与社员每日的具体生产活动结合起来。为了加强相互检查，汝溪公社各队间还互派检查员驻在对方，通过相互监督，使各生产队的生产得到均衡地发展。
    四川高产竞赛运动所以能够迅速健康发展，首先是由于运动目标鲜明，集中反映了广大群众渴望农业高产更高产的愿望，鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。其次是各级领导走在运动的前面，支持群众的革命热情，从省委第一书记到各级党委书记都亲上火线，及时解决思想、措施和物资准备等问题，把运动的领导紧紧掌握起来。第三是竞赛计划经过群众反复讨论，措施比较具体。不仅使高产地全部选择在旱涝保收、土壤肥沃的丰产坝、沟、坡和交通方便的地方，而且都采取了成片种植、集中生产、专人管理的方法，并通过干部的实验田，树立起技术的标兵。第四是根据统筹兼顾保证重点的原则，及时集中优势的劳动力到农业战线上来，保证了农业生产高潮一浪高一浪地不断前进。（附图片）
