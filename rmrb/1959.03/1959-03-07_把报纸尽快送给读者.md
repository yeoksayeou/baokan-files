    Get Newspapers to Readers as Quickly as Possible
    Postal, Telecommunications, and Transportation Units Collaborate: Henan Speeds Up Newspaper Distribution
    Henan Province has greatly accelerated the speed of newspaper distribution through extensive collaboration between transportation units and postal and telecommunications departments. Of the province's 115 counties, 102 can now read the provincial newspaper on the same day, and 99% of the people's communes in the province can read the county newspaper on the same day.
    In order to get newspapers to readers as quickly as possible, transportation departments, through collaborative meetings, are doing their best to assist post offices in their newspaper distribution work. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau delayed the departure time of trains from Zhengzhou to Luohe by more than 20 minutes to ensure the timely loading of newspapers; the running time of the Xinxiang to Jiaozuo line was also determined according to the needs of newspaper transportation. In addition, trains without postal cars were used to carry newspapers, enabling 43 cities and counties to read newspapers on the same day or several hours earlier than before.
    Local highway transportation stations have also removed previous restrictions on mail volume. The Shangqiu Special District Highway Transportation Company has changed from carrying newspapers on one shift to carrying them on three shifts (morning, noon, and afternoon).
    The Henan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration has also increased its self-operated motor vehicle postal routes from one to fourteen, and has implemented round-the-clock driving, shortening transshipment and unloading times, and improving the speed of newspaper transportation.
    Post offices in various cities and counties are also actively cooperating, stipulating that all newspapers arriving at the post office before 10 PM must be delivered to readers that night. To this end, post offices in many cities have increased the number of delivery shifts or implemented internal and external collaboration to ensure that major newspapers are delivered as soon as they arrive.
    Experimenting with Facsimile Newspaper Printing
    The Beijing Postal and Telecommunications Research Institute and the Beijing Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau are researching and experimenting with a fastest method of facsimile newspaper printing. Facsimile newspaper printing mainly uses the principle of facsimile to transmit the newspaper proof published in City A to City B. After the photograph is made into a zinc plate, it is pressed into a paper mold and cast into a lead plate, which can then be used to print the newspaper. It is not only faster than using airplanes to transport paper molds, but its greatest advantage is that it can reduce or even avoid the impact of weather on air transport, ensuring that newspapers distributed to remote areas can meet readers more promptly and regularly.
    Newspapers Follow Readers
    The Shouzhang County Post Office in Shandong Province has implemented a method of having newspapers follow readers.
    Many comrades in the county often go to the countryside to work. Although these comrades have subscribed to newspapers in the county, they cannot see the newspapers during their time in the countryside. When they return to the county, there is a large pile of newspapers at home. If they try to read them, they cannot find enough time. If they stop the newspapers during their time in the countryside, they are afraid that they will not be able to subscribe again when they return. This is truly a dilemma. The Shouzhang County Post Office has implemented a method of having newspapers follow readers. As long as readers notify the post office in advance, the post office will promptly redirect the newspapers to the place where the readers are going. The newspapers will be delivered wherever the person goes.
    Shanghai: Delivered as Soon as They Arrive
    In the past, the Shanghai Municipal Post Office had certain time restrictions for delivering central-level airmail newspapers. All newspapers published after 6 PM on the same day were held until the next day, which invisibly reduced the effectiveness of the airmail edition. Recently, in order for readers in Shanghai to see central-level newspapers in a timely manner, the Shanghai Municipal Post Office has changed its past restrictions on delivery times. All airmail newspapers printed after 12 PM and before 10 PM are delivered as soon as they arrive, so that the vast majority of readers in Shanghai can see Beijing newspapers on the same day whenever possible.
    Nanjing: Every Second Counts
    Newspapers sent from Nanjing to various parts of northern Jiangsu are usually transported by the Beijing-Shanghai train to Zhenjiang, then transferred by ferry and dispatched by bus. The departure times of the ferries and buses are closely linked to the arrival time of the train. If the train is delayed, the ferries and buses will be missed, and hundreds of thousands of newspapers in northern Jiangsu will not be dispatched in time.
    In order to ensure the timely dispatch of newspapers, whenever the train is delayed, the Nanjing Municipal Post Office immediately adjusts the sealing and dispatch routes and dispatches special vehicles to transport the newspapers directly to Zhenjiang. In order to ensure that the newspapers catch the buses heading to various parts of northern Jiangsu, the Zhenjiang Post Office also races against the clock to catch the ferries. Hundreds of thousands of readers in northern Jiangsu can often see the newspapers in a timely manner.
    Beijing: Post Office Director Delivers Newspapers
    In the early morning in the Pikuhutong area of ​​Beijing, one can often see a gentle and elegant person with glasses delivering newspapers. From the outside, he does not look like a delivery person, but his movements are as accurate and agile as those of a delivery person. It turns out that this is Comrade Wang Sutang, Deputy Director of the Beijing Post Office, who is participating in the delivery collaboration.
    In order to deliver newspapers to readers in a timely manner, the Beijing Municipal Post Office, in addition to strengthening the distribution and transportation of newspapers, has launched a major collaboration in the delivery aspect. More than 200 people, from the director to general office staff, have participated in the newspaper delivery work. Although Comrade Ding Baoyan is not in good health, since participating in the collaboration, regardless of wind, snow, or cold weather, he always comes to the office before 5:30 AM every day to sort the newspapers and then deliver them to subscribers one by one. Since the office staff participated in this regular voluntary labor, the delivery time has been reduced by one-third compared to the original delivery time. Under normal newspaper publication conditions, readers can see the newspapers before going to work.

### 把报纸尽快送给读者

    把报纸尽快送给读者
    邮电交通运输大协作  河南报纸发行速度加快
    河南省通过交通运输单位与邮电部门的大协作，大大加快了报纸的发行速度。全省一百一十五个县，已有一百零二个县能当天看到省报，全省99％的人民公社能看到当天的县报。
    为了使报纸尽快地送到读者手里，通过协作会议，运输部门尽量协助邮局作好报纸的发行工作。郑州铁路局为使郑州到漯河的车次能及时装运报纸，把开车时间改迟了二十多分钟；新乡到焦作线的行车时间也按照运报的需要规定；另外，还利用无邮车的列车带运报纸，从而使四十三个市县能在当天或比以前提前几小时看到报纸。
    各地公路运输站也取消了过去对邮件运量的限制。商丘专区公路汽车由原来的一班带运报纸改为上中下三班带运。
    河南省邮电管理局也由原来的一条自办汽车邮路，增辟到十四条，并实行了昼夜兼程行驶，缩短转口装卸时间，提高了报纸的运输速度。
    各市县邮局也积极配合，规定凡在二十二点前到邮局的报纸，一定要在当晚送给读者。为此，许多城市的邮局都增加了投递班次，或实行内外勤协作，做到主要报纸随到随投。试验传真印报
    北京邮电研究院和北京长途电信局正在研究试验一种最快的传真印报方法。传真印报主要是利用传真原理把甲城市出版的报纸报样，传到乙城市后，将照片制成锌版，经压纸型浇成铅版后，即可印出报纸来。它不仅比利用飞机运送纸型的航空版快，最大的优点是能减少甚至避免航空运输上的气候影响，可以保证发行到远地方去的报纸能更及时更正常地和读者见面。
    报纸跟着读者走
    山东寿张县邮局实行了报纸跟着读者走的办法。
    县里经常有许多同志下乡工作。这些同志虽然在县里订了报纸，但在下乡期间是看不到报的，等回到县里，家里报纸堆了一大堆，看吧！又抽不出那么多时间；下乡期间把报纸停了吧，又怕回来后订不上，真是左右为难。寿张县邮局实行了报纸跟着读者走的办法，只要读者事先通知邮局一下，邮局即把报纸及时改送到读者要去的地方，人走到哪里，报纸就送到哪里。
    上海  随到随送
    过去上海市邮局对投送中央级的航空版报纸，有一定的时间限制，凡在当天下午六点以后出版的一律压到第二天再发，无形中减低了航空版的作用。最近，上海市邮局为了读者及时看到中央级报纸，改变了过去对投递时间的限制，凡是中午十二点以后，二十二点以前印出的航空版报纸，随到随送，使上海市的广大读者尽可能地看到当天的北京报纸。
    南京  分秒必争
    由南京发往苏北各地的报纸，平时都是由京沪车运到镇江，再过轮渡，赶汽车发出。轮渡、汽车的开行时间，和火车到达的时间衔接得很紧密。一遇火车晚点，赶不上轮渡和汽车时，苏北的十几万份报纸就不能及时发出。
    为保证报纸的及时发出，每当火车晚点时，南京市邮局立即调整封发路线，开专车直接把报纸运到镇江。镇江邮局为使报纸赶上开往苏北各地的汽车，也分秒必争地抢赶轮渡。苏北十几万读者经常都能及时看到报纸。
    北京  局长送报
    在北京皮库胡同一带的清晨，常常可以看见一个温文尔雅的带着眼镜的人在送报。从外表看，他并不像一个投递员，但他的动作却和投递员一样的准确和敏捷。原来这是参加投递大协作的北京邮局副局长王苏塘同志。
    北京市邮局为了把报纸及时地送到读者手里，除去加强分发和运输报纸外，在投递方面开展了大协作，从局长到一般内勤职工共有二百多人参加了报纸投递工作。丁宝炎同志虽然身体不大好，从参加协作以来，不管刮风下雪，天气多冷，每天总是早上五点半以前就来到局里把报纸分好，然后一份一份地送到订户手里。自从内勤人员参加这一定期的义务劳动后，比原来的投递时间缩短了三分之一，在报纸正常出版的情况下，读者都能在上班前看到报纸。
