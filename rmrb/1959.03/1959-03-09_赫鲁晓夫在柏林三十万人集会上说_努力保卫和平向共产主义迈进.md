Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 7th: Three hundred thousand Berlin residents gathered on Stalin Avenue at 9 o'clock tonight for a mass rally to welcome the arrival of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

That afternoon, the highway from Leipzig to Berlin was filled with people welcoming Khrushchev.

After Werner, First Secretary of the Greater Berlin District Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Albert, Mayor of Greater Berlin, delivered welcome speeches, Khrushchev delivered a short speech to the assembled masses. He said that we want peace and we must strive to defend peace. Our cause is just, and our construction is successful. Our direction is communism, and we will unswervingly advance in this direction. Khrushchev said that the German peace treaty must be resolved. All peace-loving people have no reason to oppose the peace treaty. Berlin must have an atmosphere of peace. We have put forward a peace treaty proposal, and we hope that the West will have a rational response to it, and the whole world is also waiting for the West's response.

I thank the German Democratic Republic for correctly understanding and supporting our proposal. I am convinced that the German people and the people of the world support the peace treaty. The assembled masses responded to Khrushchev's speech with warm applause. People shouted "Friendship" in Russian.

Before coming to Berlin, Khrushchev attended the All-German Workers' Representative Conference being held in Leipzig on the 7th at the invitation. He was accompanied by the leaders of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht and Grotewohl. Also present was Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany.

At the meeting, Khrushchev delivered a speech to the representatives of workers and trade unionists from both Germanys, talking about the international situation and some issues in the international workers' movement.

Khrushchev, together with Ulbricht and Grotewohl, also met with youth representatives in Leipzig. When speaking to them, Khrushchev said that your compass is pointing in the right direction—building socialism. The most important thing at present is to organize forces to successfully complete this construction. He then spoke about the bright prospects opened up by the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and its control figures for the Soviet people and Soviet youth.

Khrushchev also spoke about the issue of concluding a German peace treaty and other issues of interest to German youth. He encouraged German youth to work hard and advance along the path of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Bebel, Liebknecht, Luxemburg, Thalmann.
