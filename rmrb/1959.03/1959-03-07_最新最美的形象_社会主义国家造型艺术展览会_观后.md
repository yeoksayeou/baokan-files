    The Newest and Most Beautiful Images
    —After Viewing the "Socialist Countries' Art Exhibition"

    During my visit to the Soviet Union, I had the great pleasure of admiring, on multiple occasions, with utmost delight, the "Socialist Countries' Art Exhibition," jointly held at the Central Exhibition Hall in Moscow. This was the first large-scale gathering and review of artistic achievements from socialist countries. It is a gratifying and momentous event in the history of human culture and art worldwide!
    Led by the Soviet Union, the artistic accomplishments of our twelve brotherly nations came together, showcasing such a great era – the great Soviet Seven-Year Plan, the beginning of the construction of a communist society; the socialist construction of each brotherly nation is flourishing. It is truly exciting and inspiring.
    In the front hall of the "Socialist Countries' Art Exhibition," representative works from each country are comprehensively displayed, showcasing the achievements and common direction of our socialist countries' art. Artists from various countries have made great achievements in creating socialist content and national forms of artistic creation. These works display commonality in their creative principles while also prominently expressing the characteristics of national forms. Socialist artists are bringing their genius and wisdom into play, reflecting the people's thoughts, feelings, sentiments, and ideals, and developing the excellent traditions of various national arts, thereby producing such brand-new artistic works. Visiting these works leaves us with indelible and poignant impressions. These are the newest and most beautiful images and infinitely wonderful artistic conceptions in the world.
    The Soviet Union's artistic achievements rank first among the socialist countries. As can be seen from the works, with the artistic creation of Soviet Russia at the forefront, all nationalities and Soviet republics have their excellent representative works. Moreover, they possess various styles and techniques, developing all kinds of genres and forms. For example, the sculpture "Swords into Plowshares" by Vuchetich, displayed in the comprehensive hall, is highly generalized and powerfully sculpted. From his works, we can understand the creative thinking of this sculptor; in the new era of satellites and space rockets, how the Soviet people are using the strength of giants to stop war and defend peace. Another example is the oil painting "Lenin's Speech at the Third Komsomol Congress," collectively created by Johanson and four other painters, which is realistic and vivid, and is a world-renowned masterpiece in revolutionary historical painting. Other works, such as Sergei Gerasimov's oil painting "The Partisan's Mother" and V.D. Feverisky's sculpture "Unbowed," are images of the heroic people of the Great Patriotic War epic. A. Melnikov's oil painting "Awakening" and Sergei Chuikov's series "The Common People of India" are full of internationalist spirit and deep sympathy for the people of Asia and Africa. The painting "On the Eve" by the Belarusian painter Kosmachev, "Getting Off Work" by the Azerbaijani painter Salakhov, and the landscape "Morning in Keirak-Kumsk" by the Uzbek painter Tanningkbayev Ural, all reflect the heroic posture of the Soviet peoples' arduous struggle; the combination of new construction projects and fresh scenery is full of lyrical poetry and artistic conception.
    Other socialist countries have exhibited various excellent works in this "Socialist Countries' Art Exhibition." Revolutionary historical themes and realistic life content creations occupy a major position in these works, exuding a moving and radiant brilliance. As Soviet People's Artist Konenkov said in his speech at the opening ceremony of the exhibition: "Only serving the people, only expressing the thoughts and wishes of the people, and reflecting the people's labor and struggle for peace and progress, is the true meaning and purpose of the artist's entire activity. The great social positive role of art lies here." The oil paintings, sculptures, and prints of our socialist countries each have their own different styles and creations. For example, the lacquer paintings of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the colored ink paintings of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the oil paintings of the Mongolian People's Republic, as well as the "traditional Chinese paintings" of our country with traditional artistic characteristics, and the colored sculptures with folk art styles, have all been well received by the audience for expressing the characteristics of their own national art.
    The oil paintings, sculptures, and prints of the brotherly countries are advancing by leaps and bounds. Of course, due to the different historical and social development situations of each country, the development of various arts cannot be balanced. However, the overall situation has left me with a permanently unforgettable impression, and at the same time has given me a valuable learning opportunity. This exhibition not only demonstrates the great achievements made in the arts of our socialist countries, but also, on this basis, will further promote the cause of socialist and progressive art around the world and lead it to unlimited prosperity!

    最新最美的形象
    ——“社会主义国家造型艺术展览会”观后
    胡蛮
    我在这次访问苏联的时候，曾以极舒畅的心情，多次激动地欣赏了在莫斯科中央展览馆联合举行的“社会主义国家造型艺术展览会”。这是社会主义国家美术方面第一次大规模的集中和检阅。在世界人类文化历史和美术史上都是一件可喜可贺的大事！
    以苏联为首，我们十二个兄弟国家的美术成就同聚一堂，展示出一个如此伟大的时代——伟大的苏联七年计划、建设共产主义社会正在开始；各个兄弟国家的社会主义建设正在蒸蒸日上。真使人非常兴奋鼓舞。
    在“社会主义国家造型艺术展览会”会场的前厅，综合地陈列着各国的代表作，显示着我们社会主义国家造型艺术的成就和共同的方向。各国的美术家在为创造社会主义内容和民族形式的美术创作方面取得了巨大的成就。这些作品在创作规律上显示着共同性而同时又突出的表现着民族形式的特点。社会主义的美术家发挥着自己的天才和智慧，反映了人民的思想、感情、情操和理想，发扬了各个民族艺术的优良传统从而产生出如此崭新的美术作品。参观这些作品，能留给我们以不可磨灭的和情思隽永的印象。这是世界上最新最美的形象和无限美妙的意境。
    苏联在美术上的成就是社会主义国家当中的第一位。从作品可以看出，以苏维埃俄罗斯的美术创作为首，各民族各苏维埃共和国都有其优秀的代表作。而且具有各种不同的风格和手法，发展着各种各样的体裁和形式。例如在综合大厅中陈列着的符切提契的雕刻“把刀剑锻成犁”就富有高度的概括性，塑造生动有力。从他的作品上我们可以体会到这位雕刻家的创造思想，在卫星和宇宙火箭的新时代，苏联人民是如何以巨人的力量制止战争保卫和平。又如约干松等五位画家集体创作的油画“列宁在第三次共青团代表大会上演说”，真实生动，是革命历史画中举世公认的杰作。其他像谢·格拉西莫夫的油画“游击队的母亲”、弗·德·菲维斯基的雕刻“宁死不屈”等，都是卫国战争史诗的英雄人民的形象。阿·梅里尼可夫的油画“觉醒”和谢·楚伊可夫作的组画“印度的平民”，都充满着国际主义精神和对亚非人民的深切同情。白俄罗斯画家科斯马切夫作的“前夜”、阿塞拜疆的画家萨拉霍夫作的“下班”、乌兹别克画家坦宁克巴耶夫·乌拉尔作的风景“凯拉克——苦木斯克的早晨”都反映了苏联各民族劳动人民艰苦奋斗的雄姿；新的建设工程和清新的景物相结合，富有抒情的诗意和意境。
    其他社会主义国家在这次“社会主义国家造型艺术展览会”中，都展出了各种不同的优秀作品。在这些作品中革命的历史题材和现实的生活内容的创作占着主要地位，散发出动人心弦的熠熠的光辉。正如苏联人民艺术家柯年可夫在展览会开幕典礼的致词中所说：“只有为人民服务，只有表现人民的思想和意愿，反映人民的劳动和争取和平与进步的斗争，才是艺术家整个活动的真正含义和目的。艺术的伟大的社会积极作用就在这里。”我们社会主义各国的油画、雕塑和版画各有其不同的风格和创造。例如：越南民主共和国的漆画、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的彩墨画和蒙古人民共和国的油画，和我国具有传统艺术特点的“国画”、具有民间艺术风格的彩塑等等，都以表现出自己民族艺术的特点而得到观众的好评。
    兄弟国家的油画、雕塑和版画都在日新月异地向前跃进。当然由于各个国家的历史和社会发展情况不同，各种美术的发展是不可能平衡的。但是总的情况，给我留下了永久难忘的印象，同时也使我得到一次可贵的学习机会。这次展览不仅表现了我们社会主义国家美术上所取得的巨大成就，而且在这个基础上将会把我们社会主义社会的、以及全世界进步的美术事业更向前推进一步，并使其走向无限的繁荣！
