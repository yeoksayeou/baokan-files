    One Day is Better Than the Next
    Huang Shengxiao brought a boatload of goods the day before yesterday, carrying them piece by piece up the slope. After carrying them all day and all night, he still hadn't finished even a corner of it. Yesterday, he brought a boatload of goods, using a flatbed cart to pull them up the slope. Although the operation was faster than the day before yesterday, it still used a lot of manpower. Today, he brought a boatload of goods, even faster than yesterday. The goods are transported by airplane, and one person can do the work of a hundred.

    一天更比一天强
    黄声孝前天运来一船货，一件一件背上坡，背了一天和一晚，还没背完一只角。昨天运来一船货，用的板车拉上坡，操作虽比前天快，人力还是用得多。今天运来一船货，更比昨天快得多，货物坐上运输机，一人要做百人活。
