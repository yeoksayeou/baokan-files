    Welcome Algerian Military Delegation
    Commentator of this newspaper
    The Algerian military delegation headed by Omar Oussedik, Secretary of State of the Provisional Government of Algeria, arrived in our country on March 29 for a friendly visit. The Chinese people warmly welcome the representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Army and extend our highest respect to the Algerian people who are heroically fighting for the freedom and liberation of their motherland.
    For more than four years, the Algerian people have bravely resisted the French colonialists. Due to the just nature of the anti-colonial cause, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown stronger with each battle, developing from several thousand to more than one hundred thousand soldiers. In just a few years, they have annihilated as many as 100,000 French invading troops, trapping more than two-thirds of the French army in Algeria and preventing them from extricating themselves. The Algerian National Liberation Army has recently achieved a series of victories in breaking through the Morice Line and attacking the French invaders' oil transportation lines. The continued development of the Algerian people's struggle has not only greatly encouraged the national liberation movements of the African colonial people but also cheered and inspired all peace-loving people around the world.
    The French de Gaulle-Debré government, like previous French governments, stubbornly adheres to its bloody colonial policy towards Algeria. Six hundred thousand French colonial troops are frantically massacring and suppressing the Algerian people. De Gaulle is holding a butcher knife in one hand and a piece of empty "Constantine Plan" in the other, using the guise of so-called "social innovation" to deceive and politically divide the Algerian people. However, neither frantic suppression nor vain deception will work. Even members of the French ruling group have now realized that they are waging an absolutely hopeless and doomed colonial war in Algeria.
    The cause of the Algerian national liberation struggle has received the enthusiastic support of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and the world. The 650 million Chinese people have deep sympathy for the just struggle of the Algerian people. The Chinese people will always be the loyal and reliable friends of the Algerian people. We firmly believe that, following the visit of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation, this visit of the Algerian military delegation to our country will further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people and the armed forces of the two countries.

    欢迎阿尔及利亚军事代表团
    本报评论员
    以阿尔及利亚临时政府国务秘书奥马尔·乌西迪克为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团已于3月29日到我国进行友好的访问。中国人民热烈地欢迎阿尔及利亚民族解放军的代表们，并向正在英勇地为争取自己祖国的自由解放而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的敬意。
    四年多来，阿尔及利亚人民英勇地抗击了法国殖民主义者。由于反殖民主义事业的正义性，阿尔及利亚民族解放军越战越强，已经从数千人发展到了十余万人。他们在几年内歼灭了法国侵略军的有生力量达十万人之多，并使法国陆军三分之二以上的兵力受困于阿尔及利亚而不能自拔。阿尔及利亚民族解放军最近又取得了突破莫里斯防线和袭击法国侵略者的石油运输线的一系列胜利。阿尔及利亚人民斗争的继续发展，不仅大大地鼓舞了非洲殖民地人民的民族解放运动，而且也使全世界一切爱好和平的人民感到欢欣和振奋。
    法国戴高乐—德勃雷政府，和历届法国政府一样，顽固地坚持它对阿尔及利亚的血腥的殖民政策。六十万法国殖民军队正在疯狂地残杀和镇压阿尔及利亚人民。戴高乐一手拿着屠刀，一手拿起一纸空头的“君士坦丁计划”，用所谓“社会革新”的幌子，来对阿尔及利亚人民进行欺骗和政治分化。但是，不论是疯狂的镇压和虚妄的欺骗都是徒然的，现在就连法国统治集团的人士也已意识到他们在阿尔及利亚进行着的是一场绝对无望的、注定要失败的殖民战争。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的事业，得到亚洲、非洲和全世界亿万人民的热情支持。六亿五千万中国人民对于阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，抱有深切的同情。中国人民将永远是阿尔及利亚人民的忠诚可靠的朋友。我们深信，继阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团之后，这一次阿尔及利亚军事代表团来到我国访问，必将进一步加强中、阿两国人民和两国武装部队之间的兄弟般的友谊。
