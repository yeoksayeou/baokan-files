    No Obstruction of the Return of Korean Residents in Japan
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The Kishi Nobusuke government made a decision on February 13 of this year, willing to send Korean residents in Japan back to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, for more than a month, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not only delayed the repatriation, but recently created additional obstacles, insisting on conducting so-called "screening" of the Korean residents in Japan's will to return home. This is obviously a deliberate attempt to complicate the issue and an attempt to break its promise.
   The Kishi Nobusuke government's excuse for advocating "screening" is completely untenable. Hundreds of thousands of Korean residents who have requested to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have expressed their strong will to return to their motherland in the persistent struggle of the past decade. It was precisely under the pressure of the Korean residents' staunch struggle and domestic and foreign public opinion that the Kishi Nobusuke government, which had been obstructing the return of Korean residents, made the decision to repatriate Korean residents. This decision itself well illustrates that it has confirmed the will of the Korean residents to return to their homeland. Therefore, what other explanation can there be for the Kishi Nobusuke government's sudden advocacy of "screening" of Korean residents, other than to show that it is inconsistent and lacks the sincerity to fulfill its promises?
    It is worth noting that since the Kishi Nobusuke government made the decision to send Korean residents back home, American imperialism has been instigating the Syngman Rhee clique to shout and scream, threatening to use force to prevent repatriation, stop "Japan-South Korea talks" and sever all relations between Japan and South Korea; on the other hand, it has been pressuring the Kishi Nobusuke government to adopt a so-called "moderate" compromise attitude (Associated Press). On February 28, Japan's "Jiji Press" revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan to send Korean residents back home "may be postponed or cancelled." This makes it very clear where the Kishi Nobusuke government's idea of "screening" came from. The trick of obstructing repatriation in the name of "screening" is by no means an invention of the Kishi Nobusuke government. American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique used this notorious and despicable means when obstructing repatriation and robbing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.
    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly stated the legitimate demand that Korean residents in Japan must be allowed to realize their wish to return home. On March 17, Park Ki-ho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society, solemnly stated that he could not agree to the Japanese authorities' claim to "screen" Korean residents. The Chinese people unanimously support this and firmly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's use of the so-called "screening" means, which violates humanitarian principles, to obstruct Korean residents from realizing their legitimate right to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    不许阻挠旅日朝侨回国
    本报评论员
    岸信介政府于今年2月13日曾作出决定，愿把旅日朝鲜侨民遣送回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。但一个多月来，岸信介政府不仅拖延遣送，而且最近更是横生枝节，坚持要对旅日朝侨的归国意志进行所谓“甄别”。这显然是故意要使问题复杂化，企图自食诺言。
   岸信介政府主张要进行“甄别”的借口，是完全站不住脚的。几十万要求返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的朝侨，曾在十几年来坚持不懈的斗争中，表达了他们要求返回祖国的坚强意志。而一直阻挠朝侨回国的岸信介政府，也正是迫于朝鲜侨民的坚强斗争和国内外舆论的压力，才作出了遣送朝侨回国的决定的。这个决定本身，就很好地说明它已确认了朝侨要求返回祖国的意志。因此，岸信介政府忽然主张要对朝侨进行“甄别”，除了说明它出尔反尔、缺乏实践诺言的诚意以外，还能有什么解释呢？
    值得注意的是，自岸信介政府作出遣送朝侨回国的决定后，美帝国主义就一面唆使李承晚集团大喊大叫，要以武力阻止遣返，停止“日韩谈判”和断绝日、李间一切关系等等进行恫吓和威胁；另一面对岸信介政府施加压力，要它采取所谓“温和”的妥协态度（美联社）。2月28日，日本“时事通讯社”透露说，岸信介政府遣送朝侨回国的计划“可能延期或取消”。这就很明显，岸信介政府提出“甄别”这个主意是从哪里来的。“甄别”为名、阻挠遣返其实的玩意儿，决不是岸信介政府发明的，美帝国主义和李承晚集团在阻挠遣返和劫夺朝中战俘时就使用过这种臭名昭著的卑劣手段。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾一再表明了必须让旅日朝侨实现回国愿望的正当要求。朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长朴基昊在3月17日严正表示不能同意日本当局对朝侨进行“甄别”的主张。中国人民对此一致加以支持，坚决反对岸信介政府以违反人道主义原则的所谓“甄别”手段来阻挠朝侨实现归回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的正当权利。
