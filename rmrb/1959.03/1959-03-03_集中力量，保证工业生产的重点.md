In recent days, good news has been frequently reported from the industrial production front. Beijing's industrial enterprises, after overfulfilling the January plan, overfulfilled the February gross output value plan by 5.9%. Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, has mobilized its million industrial workers, and a mass movement centered on technological revolution and aimed at increasing labor productivity is spreading to every enterprise in the city. Factories such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Accessories Factory have completed their February production plans ahead of schedule. The 60,000 employees of "Steel Capital" Anshan solemnly pledged a few days ago to contribute even more to the battle for 18 million tons of steel. After four large open-hearth furnaces completed their February production plans ahead of schedule, they took advantage of the victory in the last three days and increased the country's production of high-quality steel by more than 10,400 tons. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, a new steel base in central China, has also begun a production and construction upsurge centered on high furnace yield. Employees in Taiyuan, Benxi, and other places were swearing an oath to leap forward a few days ago to ensure the realization of various indicators for a greater leap forward this year.

This vigorous scene shows that a greater leap forward on the industrial front has already begun!

The Great Leap Forward in 1958 created a favorable situation for this year's greater leap forward. It is certain that realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the industrial front this year is not only necessary for the high-speed development of my country's national economy, but also entirely possible. The problem now is that we must earnestly grasp the current industrial production.

The key issue in current industrial production is still to resolutely implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward." Only by taking steel as the key link can we leap forward in an all-round way. The current situation is that after the Great Leap Forward last year, all sectors of the national economy have made tremendous progress, and the demand for steel, iron, and steel products has increased. Therefore, although the production of steel, iron, and steel products in January and February this year has greatly increased compared with the same period last year, it still cannot meet the needs. The coal production situation, which is closely related to steel production, is also like this. Because the production of important raw materials such as steel, iron, steel products, and coal cannot keep up with the needs of the processing industry, it also affects the completion of production plans by some industrial enterprises. This situation appeared in the process of breaking the old proportional relationship and establishing a new proportional relationship in the Great Leap Forward, and is a phenomenon in the process of the development of things from balance to imbalance and then to a new balance. However, it should also be seen from the above situation that in order to ensure the victorious realization of this year's greater leap forward, we must first rapidly leap forward in steel, iron, steel products, and coal, which are related to the overall situation, and strive for daily output to rise and high yields every ten days.

How can the output of steel, iron, steel products, and coal be rapidly increased? There are two ways. One is to give full play to the potential of existing equipment. Among these four products, steel is directly needed by the processing industry and construction projects. The prerequisite for increasing steel production is the increase in steel. The increase in steel production must have enough pig iron. The current situation is that the potential for steelmaking in many key iron and steel enterprises is great, and the problem is how to ensure that they are well-fed. That is to say, steel mills must receive sufficient, high-quality pig iron in a timely manner. It can be said that the key to current steel production still lies in pig iron. At the same time, an important aspect of rapidly increasing pig iron production is to ensure the timely supply of coke needed for ironmaking. Whether the supply of coke is timely, the quantity is sufficient, and the quality is good, largely depends on coal.

Another way to greatly increase the production of raw materials such as steel, iron, steel products, and coal is to rapidly increase new equipment for producing these raw materials, such as mining equipment, rolling equipment, coal washing and coking equipment, transportation equipment, and power generation equipment. A considerable part of this year's annual production plan for steel, iron, steel products, and coal relies on these new equipment for production and transportation. The production of these equipment requires a lot of raw materials. Therefore, how to first meet the raw materials needed to manufacture the above equipment has become a very important issue.

It can be clearly seen from the above two aspects that to rapidly increase the production of steel, iron, steel products, and coal, a decisive issue must be resolved, which is the issue of concentrated use of strength. We have pointed out that to successfully realize this year's greater leap forward plan, we must ensure the focus. The problem now is that in the current situation of relatively insufficient raw materials, ensuring the focus must also have priorities. Therefore, what should be particularly emphasized now is not only the principle of prioritizing according to importance and urgency, but also the principle of prioritizing according to extreme importance and urgency, that is, to first ensure the focus of the focus, and the most urgent of the urgent. This is because almost all industrial sectors, in terms of the nature of their production, are nothing more than two types: raw materials industry and processing industry. All processing industries need raw materials, especially important raw materials such as steel, iron, steel products, and coal, which directly and indirectly affect all industrial sectors. It is also obvious that steel, iron, steel products, coal and other products do not increase rapidly, and other industrial sectors cannot increase rapidly. The large-scale increase in the production of raw materials industries must increase various equipment, that is, the high-speed development of raw materials industries also requires sufficient raw materials. This interrelationship within the industry, its objective law of development, determines that raw materials must be used in a concentrated manner in order to implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward." Since raw materials must be used in a concentrated manner, it is necessary to prioritize, not only according to importance and urgency, but also according to extreme importance and urgency, so as to shorten the battle line, concentrate superior forces, and ensure that the daily output indicators of steel, iron, steel products, coal and important mechanical products rise rapidly. If raw materials are used in a dispersed manner, it will not only fail to meet the immediate needs of the processing industry, but also fail to rapidly increase the production of the raw materials industry itself. As a result, all industrial sectors will not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials, which will delay the speed of construction. Only by concentrating the use of raw materials can we ensure the production of major equipment and rapidly increase the production indicators of the raw materials industry itself, thereby meeting the needs of various industrial sectors for raw materials. The indicators of steel, iron, steel products, coal and important mechanical products have risen rapidly in the shortest period of time, and the entire industrial production can be driven and rise rapidly in an all-round way. Therefore, from a overall perspective, the principle of prioritizing according to extreme importance and urgency is a measure to ensure the comprehensive victory of this year's greater leap forward, and is a positive and effective measure that is beneficial to all sectors of the national economy.

In order to implement the principle of prioritizing according to extreme importance and urgency, a series of resolute measures must be taken on the basis of further implementing the spirit of the whole country as a chessboard in ideology. That is: the distribution of raw materials should first ensure the needs of the construction projects that undertake this year's production tasks, and the needs of the equipment manufacturing necessary to complete this year's production tasks. Any conflicts with this task, except in special circumstances, should resolutely give way. In particular, the use of pig iron and steel products in March, April, May, and June must be more concentrated, so as to ensure that the equipment necessary to complete this year's production tasks can be produced in the second quarter of this year and put into production quickly. According to this principle, the steel products and foundry pig iron produced in March, April, May, and June should first be supplied to the needs of manufacturing mining, coal washing and coking, rolling, power station, locomotive and vehicle, drainage and irrigation equipment and corresponding supporting equipment, as well as necessary light industrial equipment and market materials in terms of machinery production. All localities must resolutely transfer out sufficient and high-quality pig iron according to the state's plan, and concentrate on supplying key iron and steel enterprises, so as to give full play to the equipment potential of these enterprises. The pig iron needed by various localities for manufacturing simple machine tools can only be retained after the state's pig iron transfer plan has been completed. Coal and coke should be concentrated on supplying key iron and steel enterprises. Raw materials that have been allocated according to equipment projects must be used for special purposes and cannot be misappropriated. Relevant leading departments should send special personnel to be stationed in factories to supervise and inspect the production of these important equipment, so as to ensure that they are delivered on time as a complete set.

In order to rapidly increase the daily output of steel, iron, steel products, coal and the production indicators of important mechanical products, so as to promote the rapid growth of production in various industrial sectors, party committees at all levels and leading organizations at all levels of industrial departments must seize the time, concentrate their strength, and take resolute and effective measures to vigorously grasp industrial production. Two-thirds of the first quarter has passed, and there are still ten months left before the end of the year. It seems that there is still a lot of time, but if we don't hurry, time will fly like an arrow. We must immediately seize the last twenty-nine days of the first quarter, strive for high output and high quality every day, and prepare fully for the general high tide of industrial production in the second quarter and the second half of the year. Industrial production must be grasped every day and every month. Because if the production of this day or this month is not completed well, it will inevitably increase the burden of the next day or the next month. Conversely, if the production of each day and each month is completed very well, it will create favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling the plan in the next day and the next month. If we complete the plan every day and every month, we will be confident in the successful completion of this year's annual plan.

At present, the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production is taking shape, and the urgent task of the leading comrades on the industrial front is to continue to boost their energy and quickly organize the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. A valuable experience from last year's industrial Great Leap Forward was to launch a mass movement. In order to more widely expand the Great Leap Forward upsurge that is currently emerging, we must continue to adopt the method of launching a mass movement. The monthly, quarterly, and annual plan tasks, the reasons for proposing the tasks and the methods for completing the tasks, as well as the possible difficulties, should be explained clearly to the masses, and the masses should be mobilized to launch a debate, listen to the opinions of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, give play to the strength of the masses, and launch a production competition, so that the realization of the production plan becomes a conscious and voluntary action of the broad masses of employees. We should continue to implement the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," integrate with the masses, care for the masses, understand the masses, guide the masses to improve their awareness, improve their skills, combine hard work and smart work, combine the Great Leap Forward and the technological revolution, and combine increasing output, increasing product production and improving quality, saving raw materials, and reducing costs. While launching a mass movement, we should further strengthen the party's leadership and enterprise management, improve political and ideological work and organizational work, and earnestly solve specific problems, so that economic work becomes more and more meticulous and the movement develops more and more solidly.

We believe that with the first secretaries of party committees at all levels taking the lead, the whole party and the whole people boosting their energy, launching a mass movement, taking resolute measures, and vigorously grasping industrial production, and grasping it from beginning to end, not only the production of raw materials such as steel, iron, steel products, and coal can be greatly increased, but also all industries can leap forward in an all-round way. Let us mobilize, mobilize all positive factors, launch a mass movement, launch a technological revolution, make full use of the various favorable conditions for this year's Great Leap Forward, grasp the key to current industrial production, comprehensively complete the production plan for the first quarter, and lay a solid foundation for completing and overfulfilling the annual plan indicators for various industrial production centered on 18 million tons of steel!

    集中力量，保证工业生产的重点
    旬日来，工业生产战线上捷音频传。北京的工业企业，继1月份超额完成计划之后，又超额5.9％完成2月份总产值计划。我国最大的工业城市上海市的百万产业工人，已热烈动员起来，一个以技术革命为中心、以提高劳动生产率为目标的群众运动的高潮，正在扩及全市每个企业，上海机床附件厂等工厂，都提前完成了二月份的生产计划；“钢都”鞍山的六万职工，日前庄严誓师，力争在为一千八百万吨钢而战中贡献出更大的力量，四个大平炉提前完成了2月份的生产计划后，在最后三天中，乘胜猛进，又为国家增产了一万零四百多吨优质钢。我国中部的新的钢铁基地——武钢，也开始掀起以高炉丰产为中心的生产建设高潮；太原、本溪等地职工，前几天正在誓师跃进，确保今年更大跃进的各项指标的实现。
    这种蓬蓬勃勃的景象显示：工业战线上的更大的跃进已经开始了！
    1958年的大跃进，为今年的更大跃进创造了有利的形势。可以肯定，实现今年工业战线上更大更好更全面的跃进，不仅是高速度发展我国国民经济所必需，而且也是完全可能的。现在的问题，就是我们要切实抓紧当前的工业生产。
  当前工业生产中的关键问题，仍然是坚决贯彻“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针。只有以钢为纲，才能全面跃进。目前的情况是：经过了去年的大跃进，国民经济各部门都有了巨大的发展，对钢、铁、钢材的需求更大了。因此，今年1、2月份钢、铁、钢材的生产，虽然比去年同期有了很大增长，然而仍然不能满足需要。和钢铁生产有密切联系的煤炭生产情况也是这样。由于钢、铁、钢材、煤炭等重要的原材料生产还赶不上加工工业的需要，因而也就影响到一部分工业企业生产计划的完成。这个情况是大跃进中打破了旧的比例关系、在建立新的比例关系的过程中出现的，是事物从平衡到不平衡再到新的平衡的发展过程中的现象。但是，从上述情况中也应当看到：为了保证今年更大跃进的胜利实现，必须首先使关系全局的钢、铁、钢材和煤炭首先迅速地跃上去，力争产量日日上升，旬旬高产。
    怎样才能使钢、铁、钢材、煤的产量迅速增长呢？办法有二。一是充分发挥现有设备的潜力。在这四项产品中，钢材是加工工业和建设工程所直接需要的。而钢材增产的前提是钢的增产。钢的增产又必须要有足够的生铁。现在的情况是许多重点钢铁企业炼钢的潜力很大，问题在于如何保证它们吃饱吃好。这就是说，要使炼钢厂及时得到足够的、质量好的生铁。可以这样说，当前钢铁生产的关键仍在于生铁。同时，迅速提高生铁生产的一个重要方面，是要及时保证炼铁所需的焦炭。焦炭供应得是否及时，数量是否够，质量是否好，在很大程度上又决定于煤。
    大量增产钢、铁、钢材、煤等原材料的另一个办法，就是迅速增加生产这些原材料的新的设备，例如矿山设备、轧钢设备、洗煤炼焦设备、运输设备、发电设备等等。今年钢、铁、钢材、煤的年度生产计划中，有相当一部分是要依靠这些新增设备来生产和运输的。这些设备的生产又都需要大量的原材料。因此如何首先满足制造上述设备所需要的原材料，就成为一个十分重要的问题。
    从上述两个方面的情况可以清楚地看到，要迅速增产钢、铁、钢材、煤，都必须解决一个有决定意义的问题，这就是集中使用力量的问题。我们曾经指出，要胜利实现今年的更大的跃进计划，就必须保证重点。现在的问题是：在目前的原材料比较不足的情况下，保证重点也要有先有后，因此，现在应该特别强调的，不仅要实行轻重缓急要排队的原则，而且要实行重重急急要排队的原则，就是说，要首先保证重点中之重点，急中之急。这是因为：几乎所有工业部门，就其生产的性质来说，不外是原材料工业和加工工业两种。一切加工工业都需要原材料，特别是钢、铁、钢材、煤等重要的原材料，直接间接地影响着所有的工业部门。钢、铁、钢材、煤等产品不迅速增长上去，其它工业部门也不可能迅速增长上去，这也是很明显的。而原材料工业的大量增产，又必须增加各种设备，就是说原材料工业的高速度发展，也需要足够的原材料。这种工业内部的相互联系，它的客观发展规律，决定了必须集中使用原材料，才能贯彻“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针。既然要集中使用原材料，就必须要排队，不仅要按轻重缓急排队，而且要按重重急急排队，这样才能缩短战线，集中优势力量，保证钢、铁、钢材、煤和重要的机械产品的日产指标迅速上升。如果分散使用原材料，那就既不能满足加工工业眼前的需要，也不能使原材料工业的生产迅速增长上去，结果所有工业部门都不能得到足够的原材料，这就会延缓建设的速度。只有集中使用原材料，才既能保证主要设备的生产，又能使原材料工业本身生产指标迅速上升，从而满足各个工业部门对原材料的需要。钢、铁、钢材、煤和重要的机械产品的指标在最短期间迅速上升了，整个工业生产就可以被带动起来，全面地迅速上升了。因此从全局来看，实行重重急急要排队的原则，是保证今年更大跃进获得全面胜利的措施，是有利于国民经济所有部门的积极有效的措施。
    为了贯彻重重急急要排队的原则，必须在思想上进一步贯彻全国一盘棋的精神的基础上，采取一系列的坚决措施。这就是：原材料的分配，应当首先保证担负今年生产任务的建设工程的需要，和完成今年生产任务所必需的设备制造的需要。凡是和这个任务发生矛盾的，除特殊情况外，应当坚决让路。特别是3、4、5、6月份生铁和钢材的使用必须更加集中，这样才能保证完成今年生产任务所必需的设备能够在今年第二季度内生产出来，迅速投入生产。根据这个原则，3、4、5、6月生产的钢材和铸造生铁，在机械生产方面，应该首先供应制造矿山、洗煤炼焦、轧钢、电站、机车车辆、排灌设备和相应的配套设备以及必要的轻工业设备和市场物资的需要。各地必须坚决根据国家的计划，迅速调运出数量够、质量好的生铁，集中供应重点钢铁企业，以便充分发挥这些企业的设备潜力。各地为制造简易机床所需要的生铁，只能在完成国家调运生铁计划之后才能留用。煤和焦炭应当集中供应重点钢铁企业。已经按设备项目分配的原材料，必须专材专用，不能挪用。有关领导部门，应当派专人驻厂督促检查这些重要设备的生产，做到按套如期交货。
    为了使钢、铁、钢材、煤的日产量和重要的机械产品的生产指标迅速上升，从而推动各个工业部门的生产迅速地增长，各级党委和工业部门的各级领导机构，必须争取时间、集中力量，采取坚决有力的措施，大抓工业生产。现在第一季度已经过去三分之二，离开年底还有十个月的时间。看起来，时间似乎还不少，可是如果不抓紧，光阴就会像箭一样飞逝。我们必须立即抓紧第一季度的最后二十九天，力争每天高产高质，并且为第二季度以及下半年的工业生产的普遍高涨准备充分条件。工业生产必须每一天每个月抓紧。因为如果这一天、这一个月的生产完成不好，就势必加重下一天、下一个月的负担。反之，如果每天、每月的生产都完成得很好，就为下一天、下一个月完成和超额完成计划创造了有利的条件。如果我们天天、月月都完成计划，今年的全年计划的胜利完成就稳操胜算了。
    目前工业生产大跃进的高潮正在形成，工业战线上的领导同志们的迫切任务就是继续鼓足干劲，迅速组织大跃进的高潮。去年工业大跃进的一项宝贵经验就是大搞群众运动。为了更广泛地展开目前正在出现的大跃进高潮，必须继续采取大搞群众运动的方法。应当把月度、季度、年度的计划任务，提出任务的理由和完成任务的方法。以及可能出现的困难，向群众交代清楚，并且发动群众展开鸣放辩论，倾听群众的意见，集中群众的智慧，发挥群众的力量，展开生产竞赛，使实现生产计划成为广大职工群众的自觉自愿的行动。应当继续贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”的制度，同群众打成一片，关心群众，了解群众，引导群众提高觉悟，提高技术，把苦干和巧干结合起来，把大跃进和技术革命结合起来，把增加产量、增加产品生产和提高质量、节约原材料、降低成本结合起来。在大搞群众运动的同时，应当进一步加强党的领导和企业的管理工作，改进政治思想工作和组织工作，切实解决具体问题，使经济工作愈作愈细致，运动发展愈来愈扎实。
    我们相信，各级党委第一书记挂帅，全党全民鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，采取坚决措施，大抓工业生产，并且自始至终都抓紧，不仅钢、铁、钢材、煤等原材料生产可以大幅度地增长上去，而且各种工业都能全面跃进。让我们动员起来，调动一切方面的积极因素，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，充分利用今年大跃进的各种有利条件，抓紧当前工业生产中的关键，全面完成第一季度的生产计划，为完成和超额完成以一千八百万吨钢为中心的各项工业生产的年度计划指标打下牢固的基础！
