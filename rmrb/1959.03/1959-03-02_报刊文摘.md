“Add Another Line”

I heard a worker sarcastically say to a designer, "You only have three 'lines,' it's a pity you're missing one!"

The designer asked in confusion, "What!?" The worker kindly said, "Comrade Designer, you drew dashed lines, solid lines, and supposedly imaginary lines on the design drawings. These three lines are necessary, but it's a pity you're missing the most important 'line'!" The designer was unconvinced and asked, "What most important line is missing?" The worker calmly told him, "Comrade, you're missing the mass line – this is the most important 'line'!"

This criticism from the worker is a sharp and insightful point for those technical personnel who are detached from the masses.

Isn't the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy with technical revolution as the center now in full swing? Isn't product design revolution the center of the technical revolution? Does technical revolution need to follow the mass line? Does product design revolution need to follow the mass line?

To vigorously promote technical revolution, without the participation of the masses, it is fundamentally impossible to "promote" it. "Promote" means lively and bustling, a grand and vigorous large-scale mass movement. Only by boldly mobilizing the masses and earnestly following the mass line can a lively, bustling, vigorous, and down-to-earth mass movement be possible.

Don't regard scientific and technological knowledge as so mysterious. Any science, any technology, any knowledge is created by the broad masses of working people in the practice of production and revolutionary struggles. Those who consider themselves "monopolizers" of scientific and technological knowledge are often the most ignorant. The most fatal weakness of these people is that they are detached from the production and revolutionary struggles of the broad masses of working people. Therefore, they often "hit snags," "make fools of themselves," or act like "idiots" in the rich, colorful, and rapidly changing real life. After the socialist rectification movement and the education of the socialist general line, there are fewer and fewer such people. Especially after the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many technical personnel urgently demand progress, demand to transform themselves, demand to participate in labor, participate in production, and demand to discuss matters with the workers. This is a very good phenomenon. The party organizations of factories and enterprises should satisfy their demands. As long as the majority of technical personnel realize that they need to "add another line," and create achievements and experience in practice, those who consider themselves "monopolizers" of scientific and technological knowledge will one day come out of their "ivory towers."

"The Party's mass line is the Party's fundamental political line and also the Party's fundamental organizational line. This means that all organizations and all work of our Party must be closely integrated with the masses" (Comrade Liu Shaoqi "On the Party"). Technical revolution and product design revolution work, of course, are no exception.

The best way to follow the mass line is "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." This has been proven by the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The prerequisite for realizing "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is that cadres and technical personnel participate in productive labor. This point, although it sounds like a cliché, is very difficult to do, especially to persist in it, to make it regular, but it is very necessary. If cadres and technical personnel do not participate in productive labor at all, and talk about following the mass line, it is a kind of irony.

The mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy with technical revolution as the center is progressing on a large scale. The situation is pressing, forcing us to "add another line." It can be said that this "line" is the lifeline for boosting morale and creating a high tide. Let this "line" connect thousands upon thousands of workers!

Both Sensuous Knowledge and
Rational Knowledge are Needed

When studying the Party's education policy, some people think that our emphasis on the integration of education with productive labor seems to imply that studying is unimportant. In fact, what we oppose is only studying without labor, definitely not not studying.

Knowledge comes from practice, and learning knowledge is to guide practice. The development and change of the objective world are endless. When objective things develop, the internal laws of objective things will also develop and change. People constantly discover new laws in continuous practice, and every new practice of people needs to be guided by new laws and knowledge. Therefore, we believe that in order to benefit practice, it is necessary to attach importance to the inheritance of knowledge heritage, but more importantly, on the basis of inheriting the heritage, to continuously develop knowledge through practice activities and research summaries of practice activities, and to continuously enrich the treasure house of human knowledge. A person's knowledge comes from two aspects: one aspect is indirectly accepting others, and the other aspect is directly experiencing it personally. Indirect knowledge has reliable and unreliable aspects. The reliable ones should naturally be accepted, and the unreliable ones should also be selectively studied and criticized. Reading is a basic method of accepting indirect knowledge, so we must study hard. However, in terms of the role played for an individual, often only the things experienced personally are the most profound and strongest. Only by combining the things experienced personally with the things learned from books can they become relatively complete, practical, and useful knowledge. At the same time, practice is the criterion for testing truth. If a person does not have a certain amount of practical experience, it is difficult to critically accept things from others. Therefore, we believe that combining education with productive labor can promote people to learn better. (Extracted from "Liaoning Daily" on February 25, Liu Hanqing: "What is Knowledge")

    “再加一条线”
    听说一位工人讽刺设计师说，“你只有三条‘线’，可惜少了一条‘线’！ ”
    设计师莫名其妙地问：“什么！？”工人善意地说，“设计师同志，你在设计图纸上画了虚线，实线，据说还有假想线，这三条线是必要的，可惜少了一条最重要的‘线’！”设计师不服气问：“少了一条什么最重要的线？”工人心平气和地告诉他：“同志，少了一条群众路线——这是一条最重要的‘线’啊！”
    工人的这个批评，对于那些脱离群众的技术人员来说，真是一针见血。
    现在不正是大闹以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动吗？产品设计革命不又是技术革命的中心吗？技术革命要不要走群众路线？产品设计革命要不要走群众路线？
    要大闹技术革命，没有群众参加，根本不可能“闹”起来。“闹”，是热热闹闹，是轰轰烈烈，是大规模的有声有色的群众运动，只有放手发动群众，认真地走群众路线，才有可能出现热热闹闹，轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实的群众运动的局面。
    不要把科学技术知识看得那么神秘，任何科学，任何技术，任何知识，都是广大劳动群众在生产斗争和革命斗争的实践当中所创造的。那些自以为是科学技术知识的“独占者”的人，往往是最无知识的。这些人的最致命的弱点就是他们脱离了广大劳动群众的生产斗争和革命斗争的实践，因而他们往往在丰富多彩、日新月异的现实生活当中，“碰钉子”，“出洋相”，或者像个“白痴”。经过社会主义的整风运动和社会主义的总路线的教育之后，这样的人是越来越少了。特别是经过1958年大跃进的实践，不少的技术人员，迫切要求进步，要求改造自己，要求参加劳动，参加生产，要求跟工人群众在一起商量事情。这是一个很好的现象，工厂、企业的党组织，应当满足他们的要求。只要是多数技术人员觉悟到自己要“再加一条线”，并且在实践中创造了成绩和经验，那些自以为是科学技术知识“独占者”的人，总有一天要走出他们的“象牙之塔”的。
      “党的群众路线，是我们党的根本的政治路线，也是我们党的根本的组织路线。这就是说，我们党的一切组织与一切工作必须密切地与群众相结合”（刘少奇同志“论党”）。技术革命，产品设计革命工作，当然不能例外。
    走群众路线的最好办法是两参、一改、三结合。这是1958年大跃进的经验所证明了的。实现两参、一改、三结合的前提条件是干部和技术人员参加生产劳动。这一条，说起来是老生常谈，做起来，特别是坚持下去，经常化，却很不容易而又很有必要。如果干部和技术人员根本不参加生产劳动，而在那里高谈什么走群众路线，这是一种讽刺。
    以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动正在大规模的进展中，形势逼人，逼得我们非“再加一条线”不可。可以说，这条“线”，是鼓干劲，搞高潮的生命线。让这条“线”把千千万万的劳动者联系起来吧！（摘自2月25日“湖北日报”，作者龚同文）
    既要感性知识
    也要理性知识
    在学习党的教育方针的时候，有的人认为我们强调教育要与生产劳动相结合，似乎读书就无关紧要了。事实上，我们反对的是只读书，不劳动，绝不是不要读书。
    知识来源于实践，学习知识又是为了指导实践。客观世界的发展变化是无止境的，客观事物发展了，客观事物的内部规律也将会有所发展和变化，人们在不断的实践中，不断地发现新的规律，人们每一次新的实践，又都需要用新的规律知识来指导。因此我们认为为了有利于实践，重视知识遗产的继承是必要的，但是更重要的是在继承遗产的基础上通过实践活动和对实践活动的研究总结来不断地发展知识，不断地丰富人类的知识宝库。一个人的知识不外来自两方面：一个方面是间接接受别人的，一个方面是直接亲身体验的。间接知识，有可靠的，也有不可靠的。可靠的自然要接受，不可靠的也要有选择地去研究批判它。读书是接受间接知识的一个基本方法，因此我们一定要认真读书。然而就对个人所发生的作用来讲，往往只有经过亲身体验的东西，才是最深刻、最强烈的。只有把亲身体验的东西和从书本上学来的东西结合起来，才能成为比较完全的切实有用的知识。同时，实践是检验真理的标准，一个人如果没有一定的实际经验，就很难批判地接受来自别人的东西。所以我们认为，把教育和生产劳动结合起来，可以促使人们学习得更好。（摘自2月25日“辽宁日报”，刘汉清：“什么是知识”）
