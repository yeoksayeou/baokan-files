    Make the Weather Serve Production and Construction
    Dong Guang
    The atmosphere is the basic environment for the survival and life of living things. Various weather changes caused by atmospheric movement have always affected the survival and life of living things. Various production activities, especially agricultural production, are greatly affected by weather changes. In ancient times, mankind wanted to know the laws of weather changes and fantasized about controlling the weather. Due to the complexity of weather changes, the realization of this ideal has been very slow. Even as it seems now, it can be said that it has only taken the first step.
    
    Weather Changes Are Regular
    Weather changes originate from uneven solar radiation. The energy of atmospheric movement comes from solar radiation energy (referring to the total energy of all radiation wavelengths that the sun irradiates to the atmosphere on a certain area within a unit of time). The difference in solar radiation energy received in different latitudes on Earth in each month due to the varying sizes of sunlight incidence angles is very large. For example, the solar radiation energy that can be received at 20 degrees north latitude in February is about ten times that of 70 degrees north latitude. Usually, in lower latitude areas, the atmosphere gains more heat than it loses in terms of radiation energy balance, while the opposite is true in higher latitude areas. Therefore, this causes differences in horizontal temperature between high and low latitude regions. This temperature difference enables atmospheric thermal energy to be converted into kinetic energy that constitutes atmospheric movement through potential energy. In this way, the atmosphere is like a huge heat engine. The heat exchange inevitably caused in its movement process is the main process constituting a large-scale heat balance. Moreover, the large-scale heat balance must be completed through a large-scale north-south exchange process of the atmosphere.
    
    The imbalance of solar radiation energy income in various places, which causes strong temperature differences in various places, is a necessary condition for the atmosphere to transform solar radiation energy into the kinetic energy that drives atmospheric movement. In mid-to-high latitude regions (generally referring to the vast areas between 30 degrees and the poles), there is often one or two zones where the north-south temperature difference is particularly large. The maximum temperature difference within 1,000 kilometers can sometimes reach 30 degrees Celsius, and the minimum is above 10 degrees Celsius. Such a zone is generally called a frontal zone, meaning the front area where cold and warm air masses fight. Weather changes are very drastic near the frontal zone, and the wind speed is very high in the high altitude, and sometimes also on the ground. In the southern part (Northern Hemisphere) of the frontal zone, at an altitude of 12 kilometers, the maximum wind speed can sometimes reach 60 to 80 meters/second, which is about 220 to 300 kilometers per hour, equivalent to the speed of ordinary airplanes. Another feature of weather changes in the frontal zone is that there are many cloudy and rainy days. Usually, in the free atmosphere, when unsaturated, the air temperature drops by about 1 degree Celsius for every 100 meters of ascent. The rising air brings water vapor to high altitude, and at the same time cools and condenses the water vapor. In this way, necessary conditions are created for cloudy and rainy weather. In the lower part of the atmosphere, frontal zones are divided into cold fronts and warm fronts. Cold fronts are where cold air pushes warm air, while warm fronts are where warm air approaches cold air. On a cold front, the rainy weather area is relatively narrow. Weather changes are more drastic when a cold front passes, often with northerly winds and a drop in temperature immediately after it passes. On a warm front, the rainy weather area is more extensive. The wind is small and the rainfall is long when a warm front passes, and the weather is sunny and warm afterwards, but the good times do not last long because a cold front follows behind.
    
    Large-scale weather changes are a unified whole. The expression of atmospheric frontal zones in high altitude is a wave-like distribution around the northern and southern hemispheres, just like the courses of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Waves are divided into large and small. The east-west wavelength of large waves reaches 3,000 to 8,000 kilometers, and the north-south amplitude reaches 2,000 to 4,000 kilometers. There are only three to six large waves in the entire Northern Hemisphere. The east-west wavelength of small waves is generally about 1,000 to 2,500 kilometers, and the north-south amplitude is about 500 to 1,200 kilometers. Corresponding to the wave-like frontal zone in the lower layer of the atmosphere are the high and low pressure areas distributed in units, as well as the accompanying cold and warm fronts. Generally, the weather is fine under the control of high pressure, while there are more cloudy and rainy days under low pressure. These two types of waves are fundamentally different. Usually, large waves change little, move slowly (sometimes stationary, sometimes moving west or east), affect a wide area, and can last for a long time, generally for more than five days, and up to a month or more. Under such circumstances, it is easiest for opposite and persistent weather disasters to occur simultaneously in two or more large-scale regions. That is, on the one hand, there is high temperature or abnormal warmth, and on the other hand, there is coolness or excessive cold; or on the one hand, there is a long-term drought, and on the other hand, there is continuous rain. In most cases, high temperature is accompanied by drought, and coolness is allied with flooding. Such weather patterns occur several times every year, but the duration varies. The unusually cold weather in various parts of China in the first and middle ten days of January this year, and the exceptionally warm weather across the country from the last ten days of January to the first ten days of February, are also the result of the evolution of this large pattern (large waves) before and after. The characteristics of small waves are large changes, rapid movement, usually moving eastward, moving about 500 to 1,000 kilometers per day (in mid-latitude regions), affecting a smaller area, and alternating quickly between cloudy and rainy days and sunny days. Generally speaking, this kind of weather pattern is very beneficial to agricultural production.
    
    Local Characteristics of Weather Changes. The unevenness of the Earth's surface, especially the distribution of seas, land, and mountains, and the direction of airflow, are the main reasons why weather changes have local characteristics. Under the same weather pattern, favorable terrain intensifies weather changes, and unfavorable terrain alleviates weather changes. For example, under the influence of cold and warm fronts and low pressure, on the windward slopes of mountains, the rate of air ascent increases, and precipitation often increases as a result. Conversely, on the leeward slopes of mountains, precipitation often decreases. Also, when the wind direction is parallel to the valley, the wind force always increases, while when the wind direction is perpendicular to the valley, the wind force often decreases. Under the influence of large terrain, certain weather systems often occur or develop in certain areas. For example, low pressure moving eastward from Mongolia in spring often intensifies after reaching Northeast China.
    
    The laws of weather change are not completely the same in different seasons. In mid-to-high latitude regions, thunderstorms have significant seasonal variations, which is a typical example of seasonal differences in the laws of weather change. The reason for this is that the amount of solar radiation heat absorbed by the Earth's surface in various places has obvious seasonal variations. In summer, the lower atmosphere heats up quickly, and the air becomes very unstable. Under favorable conditions, strong air convection forms thunderstorms. Conversely, in winter, the lower atmosphere generally rarely heats up, and sometimes even cools down, the air is very stable, and even under favorable weather patterns, it is difficult to form strong air convection for thunderstorms. Spring and autumn are both transitional seasons, but in various parts of China, the weather changes in spring and autumn are obviously different. In spring, there is particularly much wind and sand weather in North China and Northeast China, and it is often continuously cloudy and rainy in Jiangnan. Conversely, in autumn, the wind is gentle and the sun is warm in North China, while the autumn is high and the air is crisp in Jiangnan.
    
    Current Accuracy of Weather Forecasts
    The accuracy rate of 24-hour short-term weather forecasts in countries with relatively developed meteorological undertakings in the world is roughly around 85%, and rarely reaches 90%. Very few countries make medium-term weather forecasts for more than five days. Only a few countries such as the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Japan, and India make long-term weather forecasts for more than half a month. The accuracy rate of long-term weather forecasts in these countries is roughly between 60% and 70%. So far, the reason why weather forecasts cannot be completely accurate is, first of all, that the factors affecting weather changes are intricate and complex, and the laws of weather change have not been completely mastered by people to a considerable extent. It is not completely clear what the main factors controlling weather changes are. Secondly, weather change is large-scale, and its laws of change cannot be completely reproduced in the laboratory. This increases the difficulty of research work. Also, because weather change is large-scale, research on its laws of change should have detailed meteorological records from various places, but even today, such data is very lacking on the oceans, in the deserts, in the polar regions, and in high mountain areas. Finally, it also lies in the fact that the local characteristics of weather change are very strong. A large part of the experience of weather change accumulated in place A cannot be taken to place B to apply. This not only increases the difficulty of making large-scale weather forecasts, but also complicates the work of summarizing practical experience and raising it to theory.
    
    Driven by the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, meteorological (climate) stations and outposts in various parts of China carried out supplementary forecasting work, which greatly improved the accuracy rate of short-term weather forecasts in China. This is an effective way to grasp the local characteristics of weather changes, combine them with large-scale weather forecasts, and quickly improve the accuracy rate of forecasts. To further improve the accuracy rate of weather forecasts on this basis, on the one hand, it is necessary to summarize and promote various advanced experiences of large-scale forecasting and supplementary forecasting, and on the other hand, it is necessary to proceed from reality and study the theory of weather change laws.
    
    Weather and Climate Need Artificial Control
    Forecasting future weather changes is for various economic sectors to rationally utilize favorable weather conditions and prevent the harm of unfavorable weather conditions. Waiting and prevention are only passive aspects of people's attitude towards nature. Transportation, industrial and agricultural production and construction, especially agricultural production, require actively intervening in nature and utilizing nature, that is to say, requiring artificial control of weather and climate according to people's needs.
    
    The methods of artificial control of weather and climate can be divided into two aspects. One is to attempt to change the laws of atmospheric operation on a large scale. There are various ideas in this regard, such as using atomic bombs to eliminate typhoons or change their moving paths; building dams in the Bering Strait to change the ocean current patterns of the Arctic and North Pacific, to achieve the purpose of transforming the climate of northern Asia and changing the direction of cold wave movement; using the energy of the atmospheric ionosphere to create artificial suns to transform the climate of high-latitude regions, and so on. The realization of these ideals still needs further research. Mankind has mastered endless and huge energy - atomic energy, which can be used to transform nature, but the energy possessed by a weather system is also very huge. The energy of a typhoon of medium intensity is equivalent to the energy of about a thousand atomic bombs. Using an artificial sun can obtain the same illumination as moonlight during a full moon, but it is unlikely to increase the ground temperature by several degrees. It seems that man, in the face of nature, is like a small boat encountering a whale on the ocean. He cannot fight it head-on, so he has to avoid it temporarily. However, with the deepening of man's understanding of the laws of nature, mankind will surely find effective ways to overcome nature.
    
    Another aspect is to locally control weather and climate artificially, especially to artificially control microclimates. This is a method that requires less investment, yields quick results, is simple and easy to implement, and needs to be researched and tested urgently. The main tasks in this area are artificial rainmaking, artificial fog dispersal, various frost prevention measures (such as irrigation, smoking, etc.), agricultural technologies to prevent drought (such as irrigation, sand spreading, soil cultivation, and leveling the ground surface), various agricultural technologies to increase surface temperature (such as windbreaks, ridge cultivation), and artificial afforestation that can achieve comprehensive effects.
    
    At present, artificial rainmaking can increase precipitation by a few millimeters to more than ten millimeters at a time under favorable weather conditions, which is very beneficial to agricultural production. But it is far from enough to meet the needs of agricultural production. Further research and improvement are necessary, and it requires the cooperation of accurate weather forecasts.
    
    Trends of Weather Changes This Spring
    The cold days in China in the winter of 1958 were not long. Only the first and middle ten days of January this year were colder than usual, and the coldest period appeared in the first ten days of January, which was 10 to 15 days earlier than usual. The weather was unusually warm from December last year to the last ten days of January and the first half of February this year. The arrival of spring this year is earlier than usual. However, there is so-called "retrograde cold" experience among the peasant masses, meaning that if the winter is warm, then there will be a fairly cold period in the spring. This is a relatively reliable experience. If so, the end date of spring this year may be delayed. It is estimated that the end date of late spring frost in areas north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and south of the Hai River basin this year will be slightly later than usual. Therefore, for these areas, it is hoped that close attention will be paid to the weather forecasts within ten days for the sowing of warm-loving crops such as rice and cotton, and for the prevention of late frost damage to oilseed rape, winter wheat, and vegetables.
    
    It is estimated that precipitation in parts of Northeast China, North China, and South China this spring will be less than usual, and attention should be paid to soil moisture conservation, irrigation, and other tasks. Precipitation in the Yangtze River basin has tended to increase, and attention should be paid to clearing ditches and draining water for overwintering crops such as oilseed rape and winter wheat, as well as spring-sown crops on dry land. In order to prevent summer drought in this area, water storage and drought prevention should also be given importance.

    让天气为生产建设服务
    东光
    大气是生物生存和生活的基本环境。由于大气运动所产生的各种天气变化，从来就影响生物的生存和生活。各种生产活动，特别是农业生产受天气变化的影响很大。在远古时代，人类就想知道天气变化的规律，并幻想控制天气。由于天气变化的复杂性，这个理想的实现是非常缓慢的，即使就目前看来，可以说还只是走了第一步。
    天气变化是有规律的
    天气变化起源于不均匀的太阳辐射。大气运动的能量来自太阳辐射能（指在单位时间内由于一定面积上太阳照射到大气层的全部辐射波长能量的总和）。地球上不同纬度的各个地方，在每月中由于阳光投射角大小不一，所接受的太阳辐射能的差别是很大的。例如2月份所能接受的太阳辐射能在北纬二十度的地方约为北纬七十度的十倍。通常在较低纬度地区，大气在辐射能收支平衡上得热多于失热，而在较高纬地区情况正好相反。因此，引起高低纬度之间地区水平温度的差异。这种温度的差异，使得大气热能通过位能转变为构成大气运动的动能。这样一来，大气就好像一个巨大的热引擎。在其运动的过程中所必然引起的热量交换，是构成大范围热量平衡的主要过程。而且大范围热量的平衡，必须通过大规模的大气的南北交换过程来完成。
    由于各地太阳辐射能收入的不平衡，造成各地温度的强烈差异，是大气把太阳辐射能变为使大气运动的动能的必要条件。在中高纬度地区（一般指三十度到极地之间的广大地区）经常存在一个或二个南北温度差异特别大的地带，在一千公里以内温度的最大差异有时可达摄氏三十度，最小也在十度以上。这样的地带一般称之为锋区，意即冷暖空气战斗的前锋区域。在锋区附近天气变化是非常剧烈的，在高空，有时也在地面，风速很大。在锋区南部（北半球）的十二公里的高空，风速最大有时可达六十至八十米／秒，即每小时约二百二十至三百公里，相当于普通飞机的速度。在锋区上天气变化的另一个特色是阴雨天气特多。通常在自由大气中，当未饱和时空气每上升一百米，约降低摄氏一度。空气上升把水汽带到高空，同时使水汽冷却凝结。这样，就为阴雨天气创造了必要的条件。在大气下半部锋区有冷锋和暖锋之分。冷锋是冷空气推动暖空气的，而暖锋是暖空气向冷空气逼进的。在冷锋上，阴雨天气区比较狭窄。冷锋过境时天气变化比较剧烈，刚过后常刮偏北方向的大风，同时温度降低。在暖锋上，阴雨天气区比较广泛。暖锋过境时风小，降雨时间长，过后天气晴暖，但因冷锋跟在后面，所以好景不长。
    大范围的天气变化是一个统一的整体。大气锋区在高空的表现是围绕南北半球呈波状分布，好像黄河、长江的走向一样。波动有大小之分。大波动的东西波长达三千至八千公里，南北振辐达二千至四千公里。整个北半球一共也不过三至六个大波动。小波动一般东西波长约一千至二千五百公里，南北振辐约五百至一千二百公里。在大气的下层与波状锋区相应的是呈单元分布的高气压与低气压以及伴随着的冷暖锋。一般在高气压的控制下天气晴好，而在低气压下多阴雨天。这两种波动是有原则的不同的。通常，大的波动变化小，移动慢（有时静止，有时向西或向东移动），影响范围广，能长久维持，一般在五天以上，最长可达一个月以上。在这种情况下，最容易在两个以上大范围地区同时发生相反的持久的天气灾害。即一方面是高温或异常的温暖，另一方面是阴凉或过分的严寒；或者一方面是长期的干旱，另一方面是连绵的阴雨。在大多数情况下，高温伴随着干旱，而与阴凉结伙的是水涝。这样的天气形势每年都会发生好几次，只是持续时间长短不同而已。今年1月上、中旬我国各地异常寒冷，而从1月下旬到2月上旬全国各地又格外温暖，也是这种大形势（大的波动）前后演变的结果。小的波动的特点是变化大，移动快，通常是向东移动，每天移动约五百至一千公里（在中纬度地区），影响范围较小，阴雨天和晴朗天交替快。一般说，这种天气形势是很有利于农业生产的。
    天气变化的地方特色。地表的不均匀性，特别是海、陆、山脉的分布以及气流的走向是天气变化具有地方特色的主要原因。在同样的天气形势下，有利的地形使天气变化加剧，不利的地形使天气变化减轻。例如，在冷、暖锋以及低气压的影响下，在迎风面的山坡上，空气上升速度加大，降水往往因而增加。相反，在背风的山坡下，降水往往减少。又当风向与河谷平行时，大风风力总是增大，而当风向与河谷垂直时，大风风力常常减小。在大地形的影响下，某些天气系统常在一定的地区发生或发展。例如春季从蒙古向东移动的低气压到达我国东北后往往加强。
    季节不同，天气变化的规律也不完全一样。在中、高纬度地区，雷雨有显著的四季变化，是天气变化规律有四季差别的典型例子。所以如此，在于各地地表吸收太阳辐射热有明显的四季变化。夏天大气低层增热很快，空气变得很不稳定。在有利的形势下，强盛的空气对流便形成雷雨。相反，在冬天大气低层一般很少增热，有时甚至冷却，空气很稳定，即使在有利的天气形势下，也难以形成雷雨的强烈的空气对流。春、秋同是过渡季节，但在我国各地，春、秋的天气变化就有明显的不同。春季在华北、东北风沙天气特别多，在江南常阴雨连绵。相反，秋季在华北地区风和日暖，而在江南地区则秋高气爽。
    目前天气预报的准确程度
    目前世界气象事业比较发达的国家二十四小时短期天气预报的准确率大致在85％左右，很少达到90％。作五天以上中期天气预报的国家很少。作半个月以上长期天气预报的仅苏联、中国、美国、日本、印度等少数国家。这些国家长期天气预报的准确率大致在60％—70％。到目前为止，天气预报之所以不能完全准确的原因，首先在于影响天气变化的因素错综复杂，天气变化的规律在相当大的程度上还没有被人们完全掌握，什么是控制天气变化的主要因素，并没有完全摸清楚。其次是，天气变化是大范围的，它的变化规律不能在试验室内完全重演出来。这增加了研究工作的困难。也由于天气变化是大范围的，研究它变化的规律就应有各地的详细的气象纪录，但是，直到如今，在海洋上，在沙漠里，在极地区域以及在高山之区，这样的资料是非常缺乏的。最后，还在于天气变化的地方特色非常浓厚，在甲地积累的天气变化的经验很大一部分不能拿到乙地去应用。这样，不但增加作大范围天气预报工作的困难，而且使总结实践经验上升为理论的工作复杂化。
    1958年在农业生产大跃进需要的推动下，我国各地气象（候）站、哨开展了补充预报工作，使我国短期天气预报的准确率大大提高了一步。这是抓住天气变化的地方特色，结合大形势天气预报，迅速提高预报准确率的一个有效办法。在这个基础上进一步提高天气预报的准确率，一方面需要总结和推广大范围预报的及补充预报的各种先进经验，另一方面必须从实际出发，研究天气变化规律的理论。
    天气和气候需要人工控制
    预报未来天气的变化是为了各经济部门合理利用有利的天气条件和预防不利的天气条件的危害。等候和预防只是人对待自然的一个消极的方面。交通运输和工农业生产建设，特别是农业生产，要求积极地干预自然，利用自然，也就是说，要求按照人们的需要对天气和气候进行人工控制。
    人工控制天气和气候的方式可分为两个方面。一是企图从大范围内改变大气运行规律。在这方面有种种设想，如利用原子弹来消灭台风，或改变它的移动路径；在白令海峡建坝以改变北极和北太平洋的洋流方式，达到改造亚洲北部气候和改变寒潮的移动方向的目的；利用大气电离层的能量制成人工太阳来改造高纬度地区的气候，等等。这些理想的实现尚待进一步研究。人类已经掌握了无穷无尽的巨大能量——原子能，这是可以用来改造自然的动力，但是，一个天气系统具备的能量也是非常巨大的。一个中等强度的台风的能量，约相当于一千个原子弹的能量。利用人工太阳可以得到像满月时月光一样的照射，但要想使地面温度增高几度就不太可能。看来，人在自然面前，好比海洋上的小舟碰到鲸鱼一般，不能同它硬拼，只好暂时回避。但是，随着人对自然规律认识的深入，人类必定能找出战胜自然的有效办法。
    另一个方面是局部地对天气和气候，特别是对小气候进行人工控制。这是投资少，收效快，简单易行，亟待研究试用的办法，这方面的主要工作是人工造雨，人工消雾，各种防霜措施（如灌溉、熏烟等），防止干旱的农业技术（如灌溉、铺沙、中耕和平整地表），各种提高表层温度的农业技术（如风障、垅作），以及能取得综合效用的人工造林等。
    目前人工造雨在有利的天气条件下一次可增加降水几公厘到十几公厘，对农业生产好处很大。但要满足农业生产的需要还很不够。必须进一步研究改进，并且要求有正确的天气预报相配合。
    今年春季天气变化的动向
    1958年冬天我国严寒的日子不长，仅今年1月上、中旬较常年为冷，而且最严寒的时期出现在1月上旬，较常年提早十至十五天。去年12月与今年1月下旬到2月上半月，天气异常温暖。今年春天的来临较常年为早。但是，在农民群众中有所谓“倒春寒”的经验，意思是说，冬天温暖，那么，在春天还会有相当寒冷的时期。这是一条比较可靠的经验，如是，今年春天的结束日期可能推迟。估计今年长江中、下游以北，海河流域以南各地，春季晚霜冻的终止日期将比常年略迟。因此，这些地区的喜温作物如水稻、棉花等的播种，油菜和冬小麦以及蔬菜等的预防晚霜冻为害，希密切注意十天以内的天气预报。
    据估计，今年春天东北、华北以及华南部分地区降水将较常年为少，须注意保墒、灌溉等工作。长江流域降水已趋向增多，要注意对越冬作物如油菜、冬小麦等以及旱地春播作物清沟排水。为了防止这个地区发生夏旱，蓄水防旱也应予以重视。
