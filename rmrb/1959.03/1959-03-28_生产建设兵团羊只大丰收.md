    Production and Construction Corps Achieves Great Bumper Harvest of Sheep
    (Our Dispatch) The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has adopted comprehensive technical measures to increase the lambing rate of sheep, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest in sheep farming this year, the best in the past decade.
    In order to strive for high-speed development in animal husbandry, all agricultural and pastoral farms have implemented comprehensive technical measures during the mating and lambing stages, generally focusing on "three fatnesses" (i.e., mating with full fatness, increasing fatness during mating, and maintaining full fatness throughout pregnancy). Based on seasonal climate changes, mountainous and plain pastures adopted advanced grazing methods such as night grazing, early grazing, extended grazing, and small-group grazing, allowing ewes to graze well and enhance their physical fitness.
    In breeding work, backward methods such as natural mating and guided mating have been basically eliminated. Measures for accurate estrus detection and accurate mating have been implemented, essentially eliminating the phenomenon of non-pregnancy.
    Currently, all pastoral farms and agricultural farms are about to engage in the battle of spring lambing. The soldiers are full of energy. Lambing headquarters have been generally established in all sheep farming units. Party committee secretaries are personally involved, and cadres are implementing contracted responsibilities for specific areas, determined to do a good job in spring lambing and re-mating of sheep.

    生产建设兵团羊只大丰收
    本报讯　新疆生产建设兵团采用综合性技术措施提高羊只繁育率，今年赢得了十年来养羊历史上未有的大丰收。
    为了力争畜牧业高速度发展，各农、牧场贯彻执行了配种、育羔阶段的综合性技术措施，普遍抓好三膘，（即满膘配种、配种增膘和孕期全膘）。根据夏、秋季节气候变化，山区和平原牧草场，分别采取了夜牧、早牧、长牧、小群放牧等先进的放牧方法，使母羊得到了良好的放牧，增强了体质。
    在配种工作上，基本废除了自然交配和牵引交配等落后方法，贯彻了准确试情和准确配种的措施，基本上消灭了空怀现象。
    当前各牧场和农场即将投入春羔的接羔战斗，战士们的干劲十足，各养羊单位普遍成立了接羔指挥部，党委书记亲自上阵，干部实行分片包干，决心作好接产春羔和绵羊复配工作。　　　（立忱）
