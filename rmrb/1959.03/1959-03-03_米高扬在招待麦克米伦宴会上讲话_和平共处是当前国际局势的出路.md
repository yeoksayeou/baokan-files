Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd, TASS, Leningrad: The Leningrad City Soviet Executive Committee Chairman, Smirnov, held a banquet on the evening of March 1st to entertain the British Prime Minister, Macmillan, who was visiting Leningrad. Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan, Foreign Minister Gromyko, and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, who was accompanying the British Prime Minister on his visit, attended the banquet.
    Mikoyan, Macmillan, and Lloyd spoke at the banquet.
    In his speech, Mikoyan said to Macmillan and his entourage that you have visited Moscow, Kiev, and Leningrad and have seen how hospitable the Soviet people are. However, in addition to this traditional hospitality of which we are proud, there is also a political factor, namely, that our people are eager to maintain and strengthen peace between our two countries and throughout the world, and our people hope that we will maintain good relations with Britain and all other countries. The Soviet government sincerely hopes to do so and is working hard to do so, because it shares the same ideas as its own people and strives to ease international tensions.
    Mikoyan said that there are many kinds of disputes and misunderstandings between countries. All of this weighs heavily on the shoulders of mankind, creating the threat of new wars, but the people of all countries do not want war. Our government does not want war either. I think the British government does not want war either. When Eisenhower and Dulles talked to me, they said that the U.S. government does not want war either.
    In this case, what should be done? Where is the way out of the current situation?
    The Soviet government believes that the way out is to improve relations between the people of all countries and all countries, to eliminate the root causes of existing friction and conflicts, to pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence, and to create conditions conducive to the correct solution of outstanding international issues by the people of all countries.
    There is a good opportunity to achieve beneficial results in this regard.
    Mikoyan said that national leaders who are responsible for the fate of the people of all countries should abandon the attempt to pursue policies toward other countries that they do not want other countries to take toward them.
    Mikoyan said that the British have a saying: "Live and let live." In fact, this is also the slogan of the Soviet Union's peaceful coexistence. Let us abide by this wise proverb.
    But how to live and act is up to the people of each country to decide. Because they know better whether socialism or any other system suits their wishes.
    If necessary, countries can argue with each other, but they must not threaten each other.
    Mikoyan then said to Macmillan and his entourage that your visit to various parts of the Soviet Union has helped you to better understand the Soviet people and better understand their desire for peace and their interests. You can be sure that there is no difference between our government and our people. We are in agreement in all respects, including that none of us is hostile to the British people. Our people and government want to be friends with Britain.
    Mikoyan finally expressed the hope that the British Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union will yield good results. He raised his glass to the friendship between the Soviet Union and Britain, to world peace, and to the governments of the Soviet Union and Britain.
    In his speech, Macmillan pointed out that understanding should be the basis of everything. He said that we can only become true friends if we first have a better mutual understanding. He said that he had held frank talks with the Soviet leaders in Moscow. Thanks to Mikoyan's kindness, although he is very busy, he is still attending the banquet here tonight. He was happy to look forward to further talks with him (Mikoyan) and other Soviet leaders after returning to Moscow.
    Macmillan went on to say that he believed that these talks, even if they do not lead to immediate practicable solutions - and this was not the aim - would be of great help to the forthcoming international negotiations. He said that these negotiations would take place because he firmly believed that without negotiations we could not prevent the dangerous situation we might encounter.
    Macmillan pointed out that during his visit to the Soviet Union, he met with approval everywhere when he spoke of Britain and the Soviet Union's shared concern for peace. He said that he was deeply moved by this. Macmillan said that he believed that we could and would work together to maintain peace. We can build closer contact and friendship on the basis of peace.
    In his speech, Lloyd said that one of the purposes of the British Prime Minister and himself in visiting the Soviet Union this time was to maintain peace. Britain, like the Soviet Union, is concerned about peace. Britain is a highly developed and densely populated country, and it knows what war means.
    Lloyd said that he was perhaps more supportive than anyone else of the principle Mikoyan spoke of today: live and let live. We believe that if our visit can contribute something to understanding each other's views and the interests of both sides, and to understanding what conflict means, then this visit will not be in vain.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd, TASS, Moscow: British Prime Minister Macmillan, Foreign Secretary Lloyd, and other entourage members returned to Moscow from Leningrad on the morning of March 2nd.
    Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan and Foreign Minister Gromyko, among others, also arrived in Moscow on the same train.
    That afternoon, Macmillan and Soviet Premier Khrushchev met in the Kremlin.
    Macmillan and his entourage left Moscow on February 26 for visits to Kiev and Leningrad.

    米高扬在招待麦克米伦宴会上讲话
    和平共处是当前国际局势的出路
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：列宁格勒市苏维埃执行委员会主席斯米尔诺夫1日晚间举行宴会，招待在列宁格勒访问的英国首相麦克米伦。苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬、外交部长葛罗米柯以及随同英国首相访问的英国外交大臣劳埃德等人出席了宴会。
    米高扬、麦克米伦和劳埃德在宴会上讲了话。
    米高扬在讲话时对麦克米伦和他的随行人员说，你们已经参观了莫斯科、基辅、列宁格勒，并且看到了苏联人民是如何殷勤好客。然而，除了我们引为骄傲的这种传统的好客习惯以外，这里也有政治因素，那就是我国人民渴望维护和加强我们两国之间以及全世界的和平，我国人民希望我们同英国以及所有其他国家保持良好的关系。苏联政府真诚地希望这样做而且也正在努力这样做，因为，它同本国人民有着共同的思想，它力求缓和国际紧张局势。
    米高扬说，国与国之间存在着不少的各种各样的争端和误解。这一切像一个沉重的担子压在人类的肩上，它造成新战争的威胁，然而各国人民是不希望战争的。我国政府也不希望战争。我想，英国政府也不希望战争。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯同我会谈的时候说，美国政府也不希望战争。
    在这种情况下到底怎么办呢？当前局势的出路何在呢？
    苏联政府认为，出路在于：改善各国人民和所有国家之间的关系，消除现有的磨擦和冲突的根源，奉行和平共处政策，创造有利于各国人民正确解决悬而未决的国际问题的条件。
    目前有着良好的机会来在这方面达到有益的结果。
    米高扬说，对各国人民的命运负责的国家领导人应当放弃想对别国奉行它们所不希望别国对它们采取的那种政策的企图。
    米高扬说，英国人有这样一句谚语：“自己活也让别人活”。其实，这也就是苏联的和平共处的口号。让我们来遵守这个明智的谚语吧。
    但是如何生活和行动，这要由每个国家的人民自己来决定。因为，他们更清楚地知道，是社会主义还是其他任何种制度适合他们的愿望。
    如果必要的话，国与国之间可以进行争论，但不得威胁。
    米高扬接着对麦克米伦和他的随行人员说，你们在苏联各地的访问帮助你们更好地了解了苏联人民，更好地了解了他们的和平愿望、他们的利益。你们可以相信，在我国政府和我国人民之间没有任何分歧。我们在一切方面都是一致的，其中也包括我们当中任何一个人都不敌视英国人民这一点。我国人民和政府希望同英国友好。
    米高扬最后表示希望英国首相和他的随行人员对苏联的访问将得到良好的结果。他举杯为苏英两国之间的友谊、为世界和平、为苏英两国政府干杯。
    麦克米伦在讲话中指出，谅解应当作为一切的基础。他说，我们只有在首先有更好的相互了解的情况下，才能成为名副其实的朋友。他说，我已经同苏联领导人在莫斯科进行过坦率的会谈。承米高扬的盛情，虽然他很忙，但今天晚上还出席这里的宴会。我乐意地期待着在回到莫斯科后同他（米高扬）和其他苏联领导人举行进一步的会谈。
    麦克米伦接着说，我认为，这些会谈即使不会导致立即可以实行的解决办法——而且并没有追求这个目的——，但是，它们对即将举行的国际谈判将会有很大的帮助。我说这些谈判将要举行，这是因为我坚信，不举行谈判，我们就不能防止可能遇到的危险局势。
    麦克米伦指出，在他访问苏联期间，当他谈到英苏两国彼此都关心和平的时候，到处都遇到赞同的表示。他说，这使他深受感动。麦克米伦说，我相信，我们能够而且将要共同努力来争取维护和平。我们可以在和平的基础上建立更紧密的接触和友谊。
    劳埃德在讲话中说，英国首相和他本人这次到苏联访问的目的之一是维护和平。英国和苏联一样关心和平。英国是一个高度发达的、人口稠密的国家，它懂得战争意味着什么。
    劳埃德说，他也许比任何人都更加支持米高扬在今天所说的原则，即：自己活也让别人活。我们认为，如果我们这次访问能够对了解彼此的观点和双方的利益，对了解冲突意味着什么这一点作出一些贡献，那末，这次访问就不是徒劳无益的了。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：英国首相麦克米伦、外交大臣劳埃德及其他随员，2日早晨从列宁格勒回到莫斯科。
    同车到达莫斯科的还有苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬、外交部长葛罗米柯等人。
    当天下午，麦克米伦和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在克里姆林宫举行了会见。
    麦克米伦和他的随行人员于2月26日离开莫斯科前往基辅和列宁格勒访问。
