Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 20th: Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah said today in the National Assembly, "I have repeatedly made it clear that Ghana's freedom is meaningless if it is not linked to the complete liberation of the African continent. We have committed ourselves to this goal, and we will provide all assistance, except violence, to help other African dependencies break free from colonialism."

Nkrumah refuted the accusations made by Central African Federation Prime Minister Welensky and some foreign newspapers that he was "inciting" Africans to rise up and fight for national freedom, racial equality, and human dignity. The Prime Minister pointed out, "This accusation against me is, in fact, an attempt to find a scapegoat for the repressive policies currently being pursued by colonial powers and European residents in Africa."

Nkrumah said, "On the issue of Central Africa, even before Ghana gained independence, the vast majority of Africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland opposed the Federation because they feared that Southern Rhodesia's racial policies would be extended to their region. Despite their opposition to the Federation, it was forced upon them to satisfy the political aims of a small number of European residents. Various cunning means were used to justify this minority dictatorship. However, all of this has failed to deceive the disenfranchised Africans."

Nkrumah concluded, "The leaders of Africa's awakened compatriots may be persecuted, and their organizations may be banned and forced to go underground, but the spirit of freedom has already risen in Africa, and the struggle for freedom will never be extinguished."

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 21st: Accra citizens held a demonstration on the 20th in front of the venue of a women's clothing exhibition hosted by Gordon Happer, a white immigrant from Southern Rhodesia, protesting against the colonialists' massacre of Africans in Central Africa and other parts of Africa, and demanding that Happer go back.

Happer had to pack up his women's clothing exhibits and is preparing to leave here soon.

The demonstration took place about ten minutes before Happer was scheduled to announce the opening of his exhibition. Demonstrators carried placards reading "Africa for Africans," "Imperialists Get Out of Africa," and sang songs of African unity, marching towards the exhibition hall where Happer was to hold the exhibition. The demonstrators were mostly members of the People's Convention Party and members of the Trade Union Congress.

The demonstrators shouted, "Pack up and get out, there is no place for imperialists in Ghana!"

    加纳总理向中非人民表示
    非洲争取自由的斗争扑不灭
    阿克拉群众高呼“帝国主义者滚出非洲”
    新华社阿克拉20日电　加纳总理恩克鲁玛今天在国民议会中说，“我已经再三明白地说过，加纳的自由如果不同非洲大陆的彻底解放联系起来是没有意义的。我们已经致力于这个目的，我们将提供除了暴力以外的各种援助来帮助非洲其它附属地摆脱殖民主义。”
    恩克鲁玛驳斥了中非联邦总理韦伦斯基和某些外国报纸提出的关于他“煽动”非洲人起来为争取民族自由、种族平等和人类尊严而斗争的指责。这位总理指出，“对我提出的这种指责事实上是企图为殖民国家和在非洲的欧籍居民目前正在奉行的镇压政策寻找替罪羊。”
    恩克鲁玛说，“在中非这个问题上，甚至在加纳取得独立之前，北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰的绝大多数的非洲人就反对联邦，因为他们担心，南罗得西亚的种族政策将扩大到他们的地区。尽管他们反对联邦，但是联邦还是被强加在他们头上，以满足一少部分欧籍居民的政治目的。各种狡猾的手段都被用来证明这种少数人的专政是合理的。但是，这一切并没有能够欺骗被褫夺了公权的非洲人。”
    恩克鲁玛最后说，“非洲觉醒的同胞的领袖们可能受到迫害，他们的组织可能遭到禁止而不得不转入地下，但是自由的风气已经在非洲兴起，争取自由的斗争决不会被扑灭的。”
    新华社阿克拉21日电　阿克拉市民20日在南罗得西亚白种移民戈登·哈普尔在这里主办的妇女服装展览会的馆址前举行示威，抗议殖民主义者在中非和非洲其他地区屠杀非洲人，并且要求哈普尔滚回去。
    哈普尔不得不收起他的妇女服装展览品，准备不久就离开这里。
    这次示威是在哈普尔准备宣布他的展览会开幕前十分钟左右发生的。示威者拿了写着“非洲人的非洲”、“帝国主义者滚出非洲”的标语牌，并且高唱非洲人团结的歌曲，向哈普尔要举行展览会的展览馆前进。示威者大部分是人民大会党的党员和工会大会的会员。
    示威者高呼，“卷铺盖滚蛋，加纳没有帝国主义者立足之地！”
