    A Pesticide for Killing Cabbage Worms - Wolfsbane Water

    The Tianzhen Medicinal Materials Store in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, recently successfully developed a pesticide called Wolfsbane Water. Field tests have shown very good results. They caught several cabbage worms that were two centimeters long and half a centimeter thick from the garden and placed them on cabbage leaves sprayed with Wolfsbane Water. They died in about ten minutes.

    The method of making Wolfsbane Water is very simple. Take one jin of wolfsbane root (wolfsbane is a Chinese medicinal material, available in Chinese medicine shops), add 100 jin of water, boil it in a pot for half an hour, filter it, then dissolve one and a half jin of soap and pour it in, stirring well. Its cost is very cheap. According to the above method, the total cost is only one yuan and sixty jiao. Because this pesticide is effective, low in cost, and easy to use, it is very popular among the local people.

    一种杀菜虫的药——狼毒水
    山西阳高县天镇药材商店，最近试制成功一种杀虫药剂，名叫狼毒水。经现场试验，效果很好。他们从田园里捉了几条二公分长、半公分粗的菜虫，放到喷过狼毒水的菜叶上，约摸十分钟就死掉了。
    狼毒水的制法很简单，即用狼毒根（狼毒是一种中药材，中药铺有出售）一斤，加水一百斤，放到锅里煮沸半小时，经过滤后，再将一斤半肥皂化开倒入，搅匀便成。它的成本很便宜，按上法泡制，总共不过一元六角。由于这种杀虫药效果好，成本低，使用方便，很受当地群众欢迎。
