Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 7th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a special meeting to support Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) and, based on the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game, made a decision on supporting WISCO's production and construction.

This meeting was held in WISCO from March 2nd to 3rd. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat. Wang Kejiu, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan and Deputy Commander of the Hubei Provincial Support WISCO Headquarters, Deputy Mayor Wu Nengguang, and responsible persons from relevant provincial and municipal departments and industrial enterprises attended the meeting. At the meeting, the participants thoroughly studied the situation and tasks of WISCO's production and construction and its urgent needs. They unanimously expressed that the work of supporting WISCO should be regarded as an important part of their own unit's work. All transportation, equipment, and raw materials needed by WISCO that the province and city could solve should be solved by all possible means to meet WISCO's needs. The meeting also decided to strengthen the organization of the Support WISCO Headquarters and establish three professional groups for transportation, equipment, and materials respectively, to regularly study and solve specific problems in WISCO's production and construction that require coordination within the province and city.

The Provincial Party Committee issued a decision on March 4th regarding supporting WISCO's production and construction, requiring all units to place the task of supporting WISCO in an important position when arranging their work and to give priority to meeting WISCO's requirements without affecting the national key product plan. The decision also proposed that the following work should be done at present: First, the transportation department should assist WISCO in expanding its temporary wharf, increasing the necessary handling tools and workers, and expanding the wharf's handling capacity; at the same time, assist WISCO in building some permanent transportation facilities to meet the needs of the ever-increasing transportation volume. Second, industrial departments must overcome all difficulties and undertake as many manufacturing tasks as possible for WISCO's required non-standard equipment and parts. Third, for local materials such as bricks, tiles, ash, sand, and stone, the supply should be guaranteed according to WISCO's needs, and Wuhan, Huangshi, and Huanggang regions are required to appropriately expand the production capacity of local materials according to WISCO's needs. Other issues such as labor allocation and the supply of living materials also require relevant departments to make practical arrangements to ensure supply. The decision also pointed out that to do a good job in supporting WISCO, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Party organizations at all levels must continuously educate cadres on the idea of "the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game" so that everyone can recognize the important significance of supporting WISCO and establish an overall concept of subordinating the small picture to the big picture.
