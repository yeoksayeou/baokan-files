    Inner Mongolia's Winter Lambs Yield a Bumper Harvest
    The winter lambing work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has basically concluded. In pastoral areas and rural areas, 1.73 million winter lambs have been delivered and survived, with an average survival rate of over 93%. The high survival rate of winter lambs is a major characteristic of the region's animal husbandry production after communization this year. Now, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups are full of confidence and are preparing to welcome the large-scale lambing work in the spring.
    In order to develop animal husbandry production at a high speed, the people's communes in various parts of Inner Mongolia improved grazing and feeding management in the winter, vigorously increased the construction of livestock cold-proof facilities, strengthened the delivery and nursing work of young animals, and further prevented and controlled livestock diseases, thus greatly ensuring the survival of young animals.
      Strengthen Orchard Management
    Nanzhuang Brigade of Pangg 각 zhuang People's Commune in Daxing District, Beijing, has more than 50,000 fruit trees, of which 45,900 pear trees have shown signs of a bumper harvest: strong branches and plump flower buds.
    In order to ensure high yields and fully supply the needs of the capital, Nanzhuang Brigade has established a professional fruit tree team of 113 people to strengthen orchard management.

    内蒙古冬羔丰收
    内蒙古自治区冬羔接产工作基本结束。畜牧区和农村已接产和成活冬羔一百七十三万只，成活率平均达到93％以上。冬羔的成活率高，是今年公社化后自治区畜牧业生产的一大特点。现在各民族牧民信心百倍，正在迎接春季的大规模接羔工作。
    内蒙古各地人民公社为了高速度发展畜牧业生产，在冬季就改进了放牧和饲养管理，大力增建牲畜防寒设备，加强幼畜的接产护理工作，进一步防治畜疫，因此大大保证了幼畜的成活。
