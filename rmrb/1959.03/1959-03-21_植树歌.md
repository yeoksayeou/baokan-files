Planting Trees Song
    Guan Hua
    (Lyrics) The emerald green river flows by the village, its waters reflecting the blue sky, ducks floating on the clouds. Let's go, let's go, let's go, planting poplars on both banks, willows on both banks, and also peaches, plums, apples, pines and firs. When the branches are thick and strong, many new houses will be built in our village, wisteria hanging from the balconies in front of the windows. Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, birds are singing in the forest, orioles, turtle doves, partridges, calico handkerchiefs, pheasants outshining phoenixes. Each foreign-style house has a green barrier, the fragrance of fruit blossoms spreading, fish chasing petals and swimming. Swish, swish, swish, the poplars resounding in the blue sky. Can our People's Commune compare to the scenery of Guilin?

    植树歌

    （歌词）碧绿的河水流过村边，水底映照蓝天，鸭子浮游在云霞上面。走啊，走啊，走啊，把白杨种在两岸，垂柳种在两岸，还有桃李苹果松杉。等枝干粗壮，我们村庄建起了许多新房，藤萝花垂挂在窗前的阳台上。咕咕、咕咕、咕咕，鸟儿在林中歌唱，黄莺、斑鸠、鹧鸪、花布手绢、山鸡赛凤凰。一幢幢洋房有了绿色屏障，果花飘散浓香，鱼儿追逐花瓣游荡。沙沙，沙沙，沙沙，白杨在蓝空中震响。我们人民公社可比得桂林风光？
