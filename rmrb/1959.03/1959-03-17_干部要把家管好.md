Cadres Must Manage Their Homes Well
Yuan Qing

The people's communization, the grain supply system, and "eating without paying" have instantly removed the heavy burden of "worrying about eating and drinking, worrying about firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea" that had weighed on the minds and bodies of farmers for thousands of years. The broad masses of farmers, especially poor and lower-middle peasants, are delighted and enthusiastically support this groundbreaking event. They are fortunate to have picked up an "iron rice bowl" from now on, and they are full of hope to hold the "iron bowl of rice" firmly. Therefore, recently some public canteens in some communes have had the phenomenon of wasting food, and the masses have asked cadres to strengthen education and management. A big-character poster by Chen Yuqing, a poor peasant in Hubei Province, wrote well: "The iron rice bowl must be held firmly, and cadres must manage the family well. There is no trick to managing the family; careful calculation is the highest."

The masses' demand to overcome the phenomenon of waste, especially the phenomenon of wasting food, is entirely correct. Although China's industrial and agricultural production has had a huge increase last year, it has not fundamentally changed China's "poor and blank" situation. We must adhere to the Party's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running the commune with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and strive to save materials from all aspects and increase the accumulation of construction. Grain is the "treasure of treasures," and of course, it should be used in a planned way and should not be wasted. Don't think that "the family is big and the business is big, wasting a little is nothing." If a place wastes a little, the number added up across the country is very considerable, and the loss is not small. Don't think that "last year's grain harvest was great, so wasting a little doesn't matter." Last year, China's grain doubled, and the average person had more than 1,100 catties of grain. This is indeed a huge victory, but China's grain expenditure is also very large. In addition to the 600 million people eating, we also need to spend grain on seeds, livestock, industry, and reserves. All in all, China's grain cannot be considered abundant, and it cannot be said that China's grain problem has been solved. Under this circumstance, we must not only vigorously increase grain production and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of 1050 billion catties, but also strive to save on grain expenditure and oppose waste.

Saving grain is naturally a matter for every commune member, and doing a good job in the production and life of the entire commune is also a common matter for all commune members. However, from the perspective of leadership, the responsibility of cadres is even greater. Whether a commune is run well, whether production is done well, whether life is done well, and whether saving is done well, depends to a great extent on whether the cadres at all levels of the commune manage their homes well.

Our cadres come from the people, and in the long-term practice of agricultural cooperation, they have rich experience. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the joint efforts of the broad masses of farmers, we will definitely be able to manage the "home" of the commune well. But we should also see that today the "home" of the People's Commune is very different from the "home" of the agricultural cooperative in the past. One major difference is eating. In the past, grain was stored in each household's urn, and each household cooked and ate. Today, the commune has set up public canteens, and most of the grain is stored in the warehouses of the commune and production team, and everyone eats the food cooked in the canteen. Here, the vast numbers of farmers who regard the commune as their home live a frugal life, worry about and supervise the commune's savings, but some people still do not regard the commune's savings as something related to themselves and do not pay attention to cherishing grain. Therefore, we must be modest and prudent, earnestly study the Party's policies, strengthen the political and ideological work of the commune members, and take effective measures on the issue of grain saving to manage the family well.

The "home" of the commune is the "home" of all commune members, everyone has a share, and everyone has a responsibility. Therefore, the content of "cadres must manage the family well" includes not only the individual role of cadres but also the role of the masses. All work can only be done well by relying on the masses and gaining the support of the masses. Recently, the practice of rectifying the People's Commune in various places has fully demonstrated this point. Running public canteens well and saving grain is no exception. In many places, because cadres have followed the mass line, conducted education on building the country with diligence and thrift and running the commune with diligence and thrift to the masses, and mobilized the masses to start discussions on running the canteen well, everyone has offered ideas and thought of ways, invited the elderly to introduce the experience of managing the household diligently and thriftily in the past, and commended outstanding cooks and other good people and good deeds who love canteen work and pay attention to saving. As a result, the masses' awareness has been raised, and some good methods and systems for saving grain have also emerged, which can not only ensure that people eat their fill and eat well but also save a lot of grain. The masses are very satisfied. This shows that as long as our cadres adhere to the Party's mass line of work methods, mobilize everyone to offer ideas, everyone to think of ways, and everyone to "manage the family," this "family" will definitely be managed well.

    干部要把家管好
    远青
    人民公社化，粮食供给制，“吃饭不要钱”，一下子把几千年来压在农民身心上的“愁吃愁喝、愁柴米油盐酱醋茶”的千斤重担给搬开了。广大农民特别是贫农下中农对这件开天辟地的事情欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护，他们庆幸自己从此端起了“铁饭碗”，并且满怀热望要把“铁碗饭”端牢。因此，近来有些公社的公共食堂有浪费粮食的现象，群众要求干部加强教育和管理。湖北省有个贫农陈玉清的一张大字报上写得好：“铁饭碗要端牢，干部要把家当好，当家没得巧，精打细算最为高。”
    群众要求克服浪费现象特别是浪费粮食的现象，这是十分正确的。我国工农业生产，去年虽然有巨大的增长，但是还没有从根本上改变我国“一穷二白”的局面，我们必须坚持党的勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，力求从各方面节约物资，增加建设的积累。粮食是“宝中之宝”，当然，更应该有计划地使用，不应浪费。不要以为“家大业大，浪费一点不算啥”，一个地方浪费一点，全国加起来数目字就很可观，损失就不小。也不要以为“去年粮食大丰收，浪费一点不要紧”。去年我国粮食翻了一番，每人平均有一千一百多斤粮食，这确是一个巨大的胜利，但是我国粮食的开支也是很大的，除六亿人吃以外，还要开支种子用粮、牲畜用粮、工业用粮、贮备用粮等等，总算起来，我国粮食还不能算富裕，还不能认为我国粮食问题已经解决。在这种情况下，我们不但要大力增产粮食，为完成和超额完成一万零五百亿斤的任务而奋斗，而且在粮食开支上，要力求节约，反对浪费。
    节约粮食自然是每一个社员都有份的事情，搞好整个公社的生产和生活，也都是全社社员共同的事情。但是，从领导的角度来看，干部的责任更为重大。一个公社办的好不好，生产搞的好不好，生活搞的好不好，节约搞的好不好，在极大程度上都取决于公社各级干部管家管得好不好。
    我们的干部来自人民，在长期农业合作化的实践中，是有着丰富的经验的，在党和毛主席英明领导下，在广大农民群众的共同努力下，我们是一定能把公社的“家”管好的。但是我们也应该看到，今天人民公社的“家”比之过去农业社的“家”，已经是大不相同了。其中有一大不同就是吃饭，过去粮食存在各家的瓮里，各家烧饭各家吃，今天公社办起公共食堂，绝大部分粮食存在公社和生产队的仓库里，食堂烧饭大家吃。这里，广大的以社为家的农民省吃俭用过日子，操心并监督社里的节约，但是也会有一些人还不把公社的节约看成是与自己有关的事情，不注意爱惜粮食，因此我们必须虚心谨慎，认真学习党的政策，加强对社员的政治思想工作，在粮食节约问题上采取有效措施，把家当好。
    公社的“家”是全体社员的“家”，人人有份，人人有责，所以，“干部要把家当好”的内容，不仅包括干部的个人作用在内，而且更包括群众的作用在内。一切工作只有依靠群众，取得群众的支持，才能做好。近来，各地整顿人民公社的实践，充分说明了这点。办好公共食堂节约粮食，也不例外，好些地方，由于干部走了群众路线，向群众进行了勤俭建国、勤俭办社的教育，发动群众展开办好食堂的讨论，大家出主意，想办法，请老年人介绍过去勤俭持家的经验、表扬热爱食堂工作、注意节约的优秀炊事员和其他好人好事，结果，群众觉悟提高了，一些节约粮食的好办法、好制度也出来了，既能做到吃饱，吃好，又节约了大量的粮食，群众非常满意。这说明只要我们干部坚持党的群众路线的工作方法，发动大家出主意，大家想办法，大家来“当家”，这个“家”一定能够当好。
