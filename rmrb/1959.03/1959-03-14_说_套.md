On “Sets”
　　Liu Zijiu
　　In order to accelerate socialist construction, we have placed special emphasis on "complete sets" in the machinery manufacturing industry. If a machine is not complete, even if it is missing a small part, it cannot operate normally. A complete machine means that the main body, components, and parts are all complete and without defects. The same applies to other things such as clothing, furniture, musical instruments, etc. When a new leading body is established and cadres are assigned, we also emphasize "forming a complete team" (there should be leading cadres as well as general cadres). In the spiritual realm, things like work methods (thinking methods) and work experience also emphasize being a "set". For example, when a person's thinking and working methods lag behind objective reality and they stick to old ways, we say they are using the "old set of tricks"; when a person's learning method is incorrect and is not combined with concrete practice, committing the error of dogmatism, we say they are "mechanically applying" something; again, a novice at work, due to their lack of practical experience in a certain task, has not yet grasped or is not familiar with the development law of a certain job, we say they are "incomplete" or "doesn't have a set" yet; a skilled worker (or veteran), because they have rich experience in the job and has grasped its development law, and can handle it with ease, we say they "has a set of skills"; again, if a person is not proficient in a certain job and often acts in a flustered and disorganized manner, we say they "has lost the set". In the ideological aspect, the word "set" is used to explain or describe that a person or a leading body, after repeated practice in a certain job, understands all aspects of the situation, has experience in all aspects (successful and failed experience), has grasped the development law of the job, and can express their rich experience, i.e., the law of the development of things, correctly in simple and clear language, so that others can easily understand, remember, learn, and spread (promote). In this aspect, it is like all other aspects. Comrade Mao Zedong is a model for us to learn from. He is not only good at systematically and comprehensively summarizing the experience of China's revolutionary struggle and construction work, finding their laws, but also at using simple and clear language to correctly express these profound and complex principles in a way that people can easily understand, remember, learn, and spread (promote), just like folk songs. To help everyone understand this, we might as well list a few well-known examples. Such a complex, tortuous, and repetitive struggle as our country's revolutionary guerrilla warfare, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized in only sixteen characters: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." For the complex political and military struggle policies regarding the Kuomintang diehards, he could summarize them in a few simple words or sentences, such as "reason, advantage, restraint," "both struggle and unite," "strike and pull, strike and pull again, pulling within the strikes, striking within the pulling," "we will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack." For such a complex and ever-changing issue as the Party's leadership method and the mass line, he could explain it clearly with such simple sentences: "combining the leading core with the broad masses," "combining the individual with the general," "from the masses, to the masses," "concentrate and persist." For such a complex issue as correctly handling contradictions among the people, he also used a six-character formula: "unity—struggle—unity," which summarized the experience our Party accumulated in this area over a long period of time. For such a complex and varied issue as agricultural bumper harvest experience, he simply used eight simple characters, the so-called agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution": "soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, protection, management, and tools," which covered everything without omission. What is particularly worth pointing out is that for such a large and complex issue as the general line of socialist construction in a large country with a population of 650 million, he used only nineteen characters: "go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," which said it clearly and understandably. In terms of theoretical principles, work experience, and working methods, there are countless examples like the above in Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

　　The main question is: how are these complete "sets" of policies, guidelines, theories, and principles formed? In this matter, one cannot be an ideological lazy person and "sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor." That is to say, in this matter, the things of predecessors and contemporaries, even if they are universal truths, cannot be copied exactly; they must be combined with the specific circumstances of the time and place, especially our own specific practice. Only by "prescribing the right medicine" and "shooting the arrow at the target" can we avoid becoming dogmatic. Regarding this issue, when discussing the study of the military theories of predecessors or contemporaries, Chairman Mao told us: "All military laws or military theories of a principled nature are summaries of past war experiences made by predecessors or contemporaries. The bloody lessons that these past wars have left us should be emphasized. That is one thing. But there is also another thing, which is to examine these conclusions from our own experience, absorb those things that are useful, reject those things that are not useful, and add those things that are unique to us. This latter thing is very important; if we do not do this, we cannot guide the war." Chairman Mao did this excellently according to what he himself said, and thus he created (summarized) a set of strategies and tactics suitable for the characteristics of China's revolutionary war. He used this "set" of strategies and tactics to guide the Chinese revolutionary war, enabling the Chinese revolutionary war to achieve a complete victory. Studying war issues is like this, and studying other issues is the same. This "set" of things in people's understanding of objective things is not naturally produced out of thin air, but is the result of people having a correct or relatively correct understanding of the internal connections of objective things, that is, the objective laws of the development of things, and being able to systematically and completely express this understanding in a language that the masses like to hear and see. It is the result of people's arduous and creative labor based on the principles of dialectical materialism. Therefore, if we want to form a "set" in terms of policies, work experience, and work methods, first of all, we must participate in human social practice (production activities, class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic activities, etc.). Chairman Mao wrote in his "On Practice": "The epistemology of dialectical materialism puts practice in the first place, believing that human knowledge cannot be separated from practice at all, and rejects all erroneous theories that deny the importance of practice and separate knowledge from practice." In the same book, it is written: "The reason why Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were able to create their theories, in addition to their genius conditions, was mainly because they personally participated in the class struggle and scientific practice of the time. Without this latter condition, no genius can succeed." These words of Chairman Mao are equally appropriate when applied to himself. Chairman Mao's book "On Practice" is specifically dedicated to expounding the theoretical issue of the dependence of human knowledge on human social practice.

　　Secondly, it is necessary to specifically analyze the various experiences (successful experiences, especially failed experiences) and various materials (positive and negative materials) that we have obtained in the process of social practice. So, how to carry out specific analysis? This is to process (think about) our existing experience or materials by "eliminating the crude and selecting the fine, eliminating the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the superficial to the essential" in order to find out the internal connections of things and discover the internal contradictions that promote the development of things. When we specifically analyze the internal contradictions of these things, we must not only recognize the universality and absoluteness of contradictions, but also recognize the particularity and relativity of contradictions. In the complex development process of things, there are many contradictions. We must analyze which contradictions exist and develop that determine or affect the existence and development of other contradictions, which is the main contradiction. This main contradiction is what we call the "key issue," "central link," or "outline" in our daily work. Proceeding along this path, we must further analyze the identity and struggle of the various aspects of the contradiction, understand the temporary and relative nature of the identity of the various aspects of the contradiction, and its permanent and absolute nature of struggle, as well as the coexistence of the contradictory aspects and their mutual transformation under certain conditions. Chairman Mao's book "On Contradiction" provides an example for us in carrying out specific analysis of specific things.

　　Third, it is necessary to implement the mass line. The reason why this issue is particularly important in the "set" issue is that individual talent and wisdom, no matter what genius he possesses, are always limited. As the saying goes: "The public is the sage," "Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang," all of which illustrate that the power and wisdom of the masses are endless. In this respect, Chairman Mao is also a model for us to learn from. Many of Chairman Mao's "complete sets" mentioned above were formed by adopting the method he created, which is "from the masses" and "concentrated". In this matter, all ideas and practices of jealousy of the talented, self-satisfaction, and self-righteousness are harmful and not beneficial. At the same time, we must also learn to use the language that the masses like to hear and see and understand to express those profound objective laws reflecting the development of things truthfully. At this point, this "set" of things is considered to have completed the final "process" and can only be officially "shipped out of the factory" after being tested in practice (pilot project). Only such a complete "set" of theories, principles, experiences, and methods can be easily accepted and mastered by the masses, become a material force, and fully play its guiding role in the revolutionary practice of the masses.

　　Everything is constantly developing and changing. If we are satisfied with the achievements we have made and are complacent and self-satisfied, and fail to continuously supplement or modify the existing theories, principles, experiences, and methods with new experiences and materials, then these existing things of ours will inevitably fall behind the development of new things and become "old sets," or we will feel at a loss in the face of new things because we do not have a "new set." This situation is called "lagging behind" or "falling behind" in political thought. This phenomenon of "lagging behind" and "falling behind" is most likely to occur during the period of the all-round Great Leap Forward. No matter who it is, if he is not conscientious and diligent, but slightly neglects and is lazy, he will be left behind by the rapidly advancing wheels of history. This is something that every one of us should be vigilant and careful about at all times.

    说“套”
    刘子久
    为了加速社会主义的建设，我们对于机械制造工业特别强调了“配套”工作。如果机器配不成套，那怕是缺少一个小小的零件，也不能正常地运行，所谓机器成套就是主体、部件、零件都完全无缺的意思。机器如此，其他许多事物，如衣服、家具、乐器等等，也是这样。新成立一个领导机关配备干部时，也讲究“配成一套班子”（要有领导干部，也要有一般干部）。在精神领域里，如工作方法（思想方法），工作经验也讲究成“套”。比如说，一个人的思想方法和工作方法落后于客观实际，墨守成规的时候，我们就说他是“老一套”；一个人的学习方法不对头，不和具体的实践相结合，犯了教条主义的错误的时候，我们就说他是“生搬硬套”；又如一个工作的新手，由于他对于某一工作缺乏实际工作经验，还未摸到或者还未熟悉某一工作的发展规律的时候，我们就说他是“不成套”或者“还没有一套”；一个工作的熟手（或者老手），由于他对于该项工作已经有了丰富的经验，摸到了它的发展规律，能够得心应手的时候，我们就说他“有一套”；又如一个人因为对于某一工作还不熟练，作起来常常慌手慌脚，颠三倒四的时候，我们就说他“乱了套”。在意识形态方面，
  “套”这个字，我们是用来说明或者形容某人或者某一领导机关对于某一工作，经过了反来复去的实践，了解了各方面的情况，有了各方面的经验（成功的经验和失败的经验），已经摸到了该项工作的发展规律，并且能够深入浅出地用简单明了的语言，把他的或者他们的这种丰富的经验，即事物的发展规律正确地表达出来，从而使其他的人容易明白、记取、学习、传播（推广）。在这一方面，也像其他各个方面一样。毛泽东同志是我们学习的典范。他不仅善于系统的全面的总结中国的革命斗争和建设工作经验，找出它们的规律，而且还善于把这些深奥的复杂的道理，深入浅出地用简单明了的语言正确地表达出来，使人对于这种高深的理论性的东西，能够像民间歌谣那样容易明白、记取、学习、传播（推广）。为了便于大家了解这方面的情况起见，我们不妨略举几个人所共知的例子。像我国的革命游击战争那样复杂、曲折、反复的斗争，毛泽东同志只用了十六个字：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”，来加以概括。像我们对国民党顽固分子那样错综复杂的政治斗争和军事斗争的方针、政策问题，他可以用简单的几个字或几句话来加以概括，如“有理、有利、有节”，“又斗争，又团结”，“一打一拉，又打又拉，拉中有打，打中有拉”，“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人”。像党的领导方法和群众路线那样千头万绪，变化多端的问题，他可以用这样简单的几句话：“领导骨干和广大群众相结合，个别与一般相结合”“从群众中来，到群众中去”、“集中起来，坚持下去”就把它说清楚了。像正确地处理人民内部矛盾这样复杂的问题，他也只用了一个六个字的公式：“团结——斗争——团结”，就把我们党长时期在这一方面积累的经验总结起来。像农业丰产经验这样复杂多端的问题，他仅仅用八个简单的字，即所谓农业的“八字宪法”：“土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工”就概括无遗。更值得特别指出的是，像在我国这样一个六亿五千万人口的大国中，建设社会主义总路线这样大而复杂的问题，他也只用了：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”十九字就说得清清楚楚，明明白白了。在理论原则、工作经验、工作方法方面，像上面这样的例子，在毛泽东同志的著作中，真是举不胜举。
    更主要的问题还是在于：政策、方针、理论、原则方面这种成“套”的东西是怎样形成的呢？在这种问题上是不能作思想懒汉，“坐享其成”的。这也就是说，在这个问题上，前人和今人的东西，即便是普遍真理，也不能一模一样地照抄，必须和当时当地的具体情况，特别是我们自己的具体实践结合起来。“对症下药”，“有的放矢”，才不至变成食而不化的教条主义。关于这个问题，毛主席在讲到学习前人或今人的军事理论的时候，曾经这样告诉我们：“一切带原则性的军事规律，或军事理论，都是前人或今人做的关于过去战争经验的总结。这些过去的战争所留给我们的血的教训，应该着重地学习它。这是一件事。然而还有一件事，即是从自己经验中考证这些结论，吸收那些用得着的东西，拒绝那些用不着的东西，增加那些自己所特有的东西。这后一件事是十分重要的，不这样做，我们就不能指导战争。”毛主席是出色地按照他自己所说的这样做了，从而他就创造（总结）出了一套适合于中国革命战争的特点的战略和战术。他用他这一“套”战略和战术来指导中国革命战争，使中国革命战争取得了彻底的胜利。研究战争问题是如此，研究其他各种问题也是一样。在人们对于客观事物的认识方面的这种成“套”的东西，不是自然而然地凭空地产生的，而是人们对于客观事物的内部联系，即事物的客观发展规律有了正确的或比较正确的认识，并且能够用群众喜闻乐见的语言再把这种认识系统地完整地表达出来的结果。它是人们根据辩证唯物论的原理，对于客观事物进行了艰苦的创造性的劳动的结果。因此如果我们要想使我们自己能够在政策、工作经验、工作方法等方面形成“一套”，首先，就要参加到人的社会实践（生产活动、阶级斗争、政治生活、科学和艺术活动，等等）中去。毛主席在他的“实践论”中这样写着：“辩证唯物论的认识论把实践提到第一的地位，认为人的认识一点也不能离开实践，排斥一切否认实践重要性，使认识离开实践的错误理论。”在同一书中又写道：“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林之所以能够作出他们的理论，除了他们的天才条件之外，主要地是他们亲自参加了当时的阶级斗争和科学实践的实践，没有这后一个条件，任何天才也是不能成功的。”毛主席的这些话，拿过来用在他自己身上是同样恰当的。毛主席的“实践论”这本书，就是专门阐述人的认识对人的社会实践的依赖关系这个理论问题的。
    其次，就是对于我们在社会实践过程中所获得的各种经验（成功的经验，尤其是失败的经验）和各种材料（正面的材料和反面的材料）进行具体地分析。那么，怎样进行具体地分析呢？这些就是对于我们已有的经验或材料进行“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的加工（思考）以便从中找出事物的内在关联，发现推动事物发展的内部矛盾。在我们具体地去分析这些事物的内部矛盾的时候，不但要认识矛盾的普遍性，绝对性，而且更要认识矛盾的特殊性、相对性。在复杂的事物发展过程中，存在着的许多矛盾，要分析出那种矛盾的存在和发展是规定或影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展的主要矛盾。这种主要的矛盾就是我们在日常工作中所说的“关键问题”，或“中心环节”，或“纲”的东西。循此前进，还要更进一步地分析矛盾诸方面的同一性和斗争性，了解矛盾诸方面的同一性的暂时性、相对性和它的斗争性的永久性、绝对性，以及矛盾着两个方面的同时共处和在一定条件之下的相互转化。毛主席的“矛盾论”一书，在对于具体的事物进行具体地分析方面给我们提供了一个范例。
    第三，就是要贯彻执行群众路线。这个问题在成
  “套”问题上之所以特别重要，就是因为个人的才能智慧，不管他具有什么样的天才，总是有限的。语云：“众人就是圣人”“三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮”都是说明群众的力量和智慧是无穷无尽的。在这一方面，毛主席也是我们学习的榜样。前边所举的毛主席的许多
  “成套”的东西，多系采用他所创造的那种“从群众中来”“集中起来”的办法形成的。在这个问题上，一切嫉贤忌能、自满自足、自以为是的想法和做法都是有百害而无一利的。同时，还要学会运用群众所喜闻乐道、明白易懂的语言把那些深奥的反映事物发展的客观规律，如实地表达出来。到此，这“套”东西，才算是完成了最后的一道“工序”，并且还要经过实践的检验（试点）之后，才能够正式“出厂”。只有这样的成“套”的理论、原则、经验、方法，才容易为群众所接受并且掌握，变为一种物质力量，在群众性的革命实践过程中，才能充分地发挥它的指导作用。
    一切事物都是不断发展不断变化的，如果我们满足于既得的成就，而沾沾自喜，故步自封，不能够不断地用新的经验和材料来补充或者修改已有的理论、原则、经验、方法，那么，我们这些已有的东西就必然落在新的事物的发展的后面，变成“老一套”，或者在新的事物面前，因为自己没有“新的一套”而感到无所措手足，这种情况，在政治思想上就叫做“落伍”“掉队”。这种“落伍”、“掉队”的现象，在全面大跃进的时期，最容易出现。无论是谁，如果他不兢兢业业，而稍有忽视怠惰，就会被飞速前进的历史车轮甩在后面。这是值得我们每一个人时刻警惕留神的。
