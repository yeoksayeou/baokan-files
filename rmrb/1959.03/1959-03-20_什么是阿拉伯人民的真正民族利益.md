Editorial:

    After the suppression of the Shawwaf rebellion, the whole of Iraq rejoiced, and the people were filled with happiness. At the same time, all those who support national independence, support peaceful coexistence, oppose imperialism, and oppose aggressive policies all over the world also expressed their heartfelt congratulations on the victory of the Iraqi people. At this time, the imperialists openly expressed their regret over the failure of the Shawwaf rebellion. In particular, the United States imperialism, which had just signed a military agreement with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan that endangers the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and tried to carry out the conspiracy of armed intervention in Iraq that failed last summer, made no secret of its deep-rooted hostility towards the Republic of Iraq. They are now bragging and trying to cover up their aggressive aims with the guise of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, and hope to use this to lead the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Arab countries, astray, so as to reap the benefits. This is, of course, not surprising.

    However, what is surprising is the attitude taken by the United Arab Republic towards Iraq. Recently, especially after the Shawwaf rebellion, the propaganda organs of Cairo and Damascus launched a fanatical movement to attack the Republic of Iraq. They called the Shawwaf rebellion conspiracy a "revolution," called the traitor Shawwaf a "revolutionary leader," and widely disseminated the "communiqu√©s" of the rebels. At the same time, in the Syrian region and the Egyptian region of the UAR authorities, they even held demonstrative funerals for the Shawwaf clique, inciting the masses to hate Iraq and "overthrow Qasim." In recent days, UAR President Nasser has personally come forward to deliver speeches repeatedly, fiercely attacking the Qasim government of Iraq. He slandered Qasim as a "traitor" and "dictator," saying that "Qasim will suffer a fate similar to that of Nuri al-Said," and tried his best to praise Ali Arif, Shawwaf and others who betrayed Iraqi national independence, and openly declared that a new Mosul rebellion would occur in Iraq. In these speeches, Nasser also attacked the communists of Iraq and Arab countries, slandering them as "foreign agents," insisting that they were trying to eliminate nationalism and were hostile to all Arab countries. All these practices, which are very rare in international relations, have created a tense situation between the UAR and Iraq, and have aroused the concern of all friends of the UAR and Iraq, of the entire Arab countries, and of all friends of the cause of national independence in Asia and Africa. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and the public opinion of many peaceful and neutral countries have expressed concern about the current tense situation between Iraq and the UAR. On March 16, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev delivered a speech while receiving the Iraqi government delegation, expressing the hope in a warm and friendly manner that reason would prevail in the relations between Iraq and the UAR, and that every effort would be made to eliminate the conflict between these two Arab countries, so that this conflict would not be exploited by the imperialists. We fully support this wise advice that is beneficial to all Arab people, and deeply hope that this friendly wish will eventually become a reality.

    It is regrettable that President Nasser immediately issued a statement on the evening of the 16th. In this statement, he not only rejected Khrushchev's advice, but also, in fact, wanted the people of the UAR to forget the Soviet Union's consistent selfless assistance and non-interference in internal affairs to Egypt, Syria, and the UAR, implying that the Soviet Union was hindering the independence of the UAR, and inciting the people of the UAR to rise up against the so-called "provocations" from the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the official Middle East News Agency of the UAR and Cairo Radio openly published absurd comments, saying that Arab nationalism had launched an open struggle against so-called "communist imperialism," that the Arab Communist Party was a "Moscow agent," and that communism was the "number one enemy of Arab nationalism," and so on.

    At almost the same time, the mouthpiece of U.S. imperialism, "The New York Times," wrote in almost the same tone: "What worries us most today is the infiltration of communism... The entire concept of Arab nationalism is in danger... Nasser has lost a battle, and so has the West. Foresight and vigilance are needed to ensure that the Russians do not win a major battle." U.S. imperialism is obviously adding fuel to the fire. The U.S. imperialism, which occupied Lebanon and Britain occupied Jordan with full arms last July, has become a protector of Arab nationalism in the blink of an eye. Isn't this worthy of deep thought and vigilance? We Chinese people have forged a deep friendship with the Arab people in the struggle against aggression and for independence in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, Algeria and all other Arab countries. Our past fate is the same, and now we are still facing the same imperialist aggression and threats. Precisely because of this situation, we cannot but express great concern about the current situation between the UAR and Iraq, as well as the entire Middle East situation.

    We have always believed that the five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, should be the basic norms of international relations. Our country, the UAR, and many other Asian and African countries all recognize these principles. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in January 1958 both declared the Ten Principles based on the spirit of the Five Principles. These principles stipulate: respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations; non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of other countries; no country to exert pressure on other countries; not to threaten or use force by acts of aggression to violate the territorial integrity or political independence of any country; resolve international disputes through peaceful means; and so on. In the past, the UAR not only advocated these principles, but also fought for them when the imperialist countries violated these principles against Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and other countries, and thus won the sympathy and respect of the world. What is the situation today?

    The current movement against Iraq by the UAR, in any case, cannot be considered to be in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence, nor can it be considered to be in line with the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, non-exertion of pressure, and non-threatening of the political independence of other countries. Even the UAR's spokesmen have always avoided talking about these principles in relation to Iraq. The matter is very clear: it was not Iraq that created the Arif incident and the Shawwaf rebellion in the UAR, it was not the smaller Iraq that was threatening and demanding the merger of the larger UAR, it was not the Prime Minister of Iraq who was plotting to subvert the President of the UAR and threatening that he must overthrown. Even American newspapers that sympathize with Nasser, such as the "New York Herald Tribune," described his attack on Qasim as "unprecedentedly savage." People all over the world have seen that the person who was once interfered in internal affairs is now interfering in the internal affairs of others, the person who was once subjected to pressure is now putting pressure on others, and the person who was once threatened by force and subversion activities is now threatening others with force and subversion activities. No matter what kind of excuse such a person is using, or what kind of excuse he will use in the future, it is always difficult for the world to give him sympathy and respect again, and it is always difficult not to make a new judgment on him based on new facts. It is very clear that all people in the world who advocate peaceful coexistence and oppose interference in internal affairs, will oppose interference and subversion activities against Iraq today, just as they once opposed the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, opposed the US and Britain subverting the governments of Egypt and Syria, and opposed the US and Britain sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan to interfere in the Iraqi revolution. The reason is very simple: such activities threaten normal international relations and threaten peace in the Middle East.

    Some commentators in Cairo are trying to prove that Nasser's position has not changed, but Khrushchev's position has changed, and the position of communists, progressives, and peace advocates in the world has changed. This "proof" is futile. If the interfered becomes the interferer, how can it be said that the position has not changed? And since the position of those who oppose interference has not changed with it, how can the new interferer be supported? If it is supported, then it is changing from the position of upholding the Five Principles to the position of abandoning the Five Principles, from the position of upholding the Bandung Declaration and the Cairo Declaration to the position of abandoning the Bandung Declaration and the Cairo Declaration.

    President Nasser has repeatedly stated that he does not demand the merger of Iraq. This is a good statement. We believe that as long as this statement is earnestly implemented, the relations between Iraq and the UAR will eventually improve. The problem is that the large number of facts in the current Iraq-UAR relations do not conform to the spirit of this statement. The official rhetoric of the UAR, including the rhetoric of President Nasser himself, seems to want to treat all relations between Arab countries, and even the diplomacy and internal affairs of all Arab countries outside the UAR, as the internal affairs of the UAR alone. Whoever wants to express opinions on these issues is interfering in the internal affairs of the UAR, who is violating the independence and dignity of the UAR, and who is to make the UAR and all Arab countries "subordinate" and "join the group." This kind of arbitrariness will not convince anyone, nor will it shut people's mouths. But those who carry out this arbitrary propaganda are unintentionally proving a fact that they are unwilling to directly admit, that is, they regard Iraq's diplomacy and internal affairs as the UAR's diplomacy and internal affairs, that is to say, they not only want to merge Iraq, but simply think that Iraq has already been merged; not only Iraq, but all other Arab countries have been merged. People know that there is no law in the world, and there is no common resolution among the Arab countries, stipulating that all Arab countries are a province of the UAR, must obey the rule of a certain person, and must take the political views of a certain person as political views. Between the Arab countries, peaceful coexistence is still needed, and the Five Principles and Ten Principles still apply, isn't this a fact?

    The representatives of the Arab countries, including Nasser himself, when attending the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, each adopted the declarations of these two conferences in the capacity of independent countries, and did not think that their country was an exception, isn't this a fact? Since this is the case, no government or individual can insist that the diplomacy and internal affairs of Iraq and other Arab countries must be "subordinate" to the UAR, and other countries' support for Iraq and other Arab countries is interfering in the internal affairs of the UAR, and is to make the UAR "subordinate." Isn't all this as clear as the sun in the sky?

    The broad masses of the Arab countries hope that one day they can get rid of the control of imperialism and realize the unification of the Arabs according to their own wishes. This is a good wish, and we sympathize with this wish. But the more we want to realize this wish, the more we must abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs, because only in this way can we easily eliminate differences and strengthen mutual trust and unity. Khrushchev pointed out in his speech on the 16th that it is a complicated issue for several countries to unite into one country. Only when all the characteristics of the countries implementing the union are valued can the union of countries bring benefits to the people. A union imposed on the people will make the people of a country participating in the union increasingly feel the loss of their own independence, then what will happen is not the strengthening of unity, but the division of forces, which will only benefit the imperialists. What a sincere voice of friends of the UAR and friends of the Arab people! Even if this voice is temporarily brutally distorted by some people in the UAR, it will eventually show the power of its truth. Hasn't the fact already proved the undoubted correctness of this advice? The UAR's recent statements and actions towards Iraq and some other Arab countries have not promoted the progress of Arab unity, but have seriously damaged the progress of Arab unity, and have not narrowed the differences and doubts that originally existed, but have widened these differences and doubts. The prestige of the UAR among the Arab countries has not risen but has fallen, and the friends of the UAR have not increased but have decreased. The only ones who are happy about this situation are the imperialists and their Yugoslav echoes. Is this the national interest of the Arab people? Moreover, is this the national interest of the UAR?

    The spokesmen of the UAR said that they attacked Iraq because Iraq was under the control of communism, and communism is prohibited by the government of the UAR. We have already said that no one has given the UAR a privilege to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. At the same time, it is also nonsense to say that Iraq is under the control of communism. The UAR authorities accuse Iraq of "terror" and "dictatorship," which is particularly regrettable, because this inevitably leads people to compare the situations of the two countries. We have no intention of commenting here on issues that truly belong to the scope of the UAR's internal affairs. But when it comes to Iraq, people cannot help but see how great a power Iraq's democratization cause has shown in the struggle to defend national independence, even though it is still in its infancy. If it were not for relying on democracy, not relying on the people, the Republic of Iraq would have been unable to withstand the repeated attacks of domestic and foreign reactionary forces. The example of Iraq illustrates to the patriots of all Arab countries and all Asian and African countries that in order to safeguard their national independence, in order to consolidate their national unity, and in order to develop their national interests, what is needed is not to implement terror and autocracy, not to suppress democracy, but precisely to develop democracy. The reason is very clear: whoever does not rely on imperialism and its running dogs, the reactionary forces, whoever wants to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and the reactionary forces, must resolutely rely on the people.

    What is incomprehensible is that the Iraqi people have overthrown tyranny and begun to realize democracy, why would this cause tension between Iraq and the UAR? In order to realize the unification of the Arabs, of course, we must first assist the people of Algeria, Jordan, Oman and other countries under direct imperialist aggression to gain independence, why is Iraq, which has already achieved independence, taken as the first goal at present? When the anti-imperialist struggle of various oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially Africa where Cairo is located, is rising and continuing to grow, the UAR authorities, who once stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, are silent about imperialist aggression, while conducting such a fierce attack on Iraq in West Asia, which is determined to oppose imperialism, what exactly is going on? Everyone knows that after a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, the Iraqi people finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the agent of imperialism, on July 14, 1958, and established an independent and free republic. The victory of the Iraqi revolution shattered an aggressive cornerstone of imperialism in the Middle East and created more favorable conditions for the struggle of the Arab people for national liberation. Therefore, defending the fruits of this revolution is not only the sacred mission of the Iraqi people, but also the common mission of the Arab people. From the first day of the birth of the Republic of Iraq, imperialism regarded it as a thorn in its side and never stopped its subversion and sabotage activities against Iraq. However, the Iraqi people have stood up. Under the leadership of the government headed by Prime Minister Qasim, they are united and determined to defend their national independence, and have repeatedly crushed the subversive conspiracies of imperialism and foreign aggressive forces. The government of the Republic of Iraq adheres to the principles of the Bandung Conference, pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, and actively advocates solidarity and cooperation with the people of the Arab countries. All these have been warmly supported by the Iraqi people. It is not difficult to judge that in this case, the attack on Iraq is suitable for the national interests of the Arab people, or for the interests of the common enemy of the Arab people, imperialism. For a long time, imperialism has been trying to provoke relations between Arab countries and implement the policy of "using Arabs to fight Arabs" and "divide and rule." Especially after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, in order to isolate the Republic of Iraq and realize its plan of breaking them one by one, it has tried every means to make the UAR and Iraq conflict. This plan of US imperialism was obviously achieved some progress after US special envoy Rountree visited the Middle East last December. People have seen that since then, the official and semi-official propaganda organs of the UAR no longer seriously oppose the American and British imperialism; on the contrary, they even spread the argument that the anti-imperialist task has been completed, and concentrated the firepower of attack on Iraq, which imperialism hates most in the Middle East. This fact can of course only arouse the unease of all sincere anti-imperialist fighters and all sincere Arab patriots. People can't help but ask: What will all this bring to the UAR and the Arab world?

    When the UAR authorities stopped the anti-imperialist struggle and carried out the anti-Iraq struggle, they also launched a fierce anti-communist campaign, which is not surprising to us. The people of our country know from their own history that whoever leaves the position of the people and the position of anti-imperialism will inevitably oppose communism, because the Communist Party is the most loyal defender of the interests of the people and the most determined fighter against imperialism. The people of our country also know deeply that this is contrary to the national interests of the UAR, just as Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communism once greatly helped the Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. But the issue that the people of our country are most concerned about is that the UAR authorities' anti-communism is far from being limited to domestic issues. First, they opposed the communists outside the UAR from the beginning. Secondly, they slandered the communists as "foreign agents," and now they directly slandered the communists as agents of the Soviet Union, and directly slandered the Soviet Union as so-called "communist imperialism," thus they have combined anti-communism with anti-Sovietism. This kind of behavior by the UAR authorities is of course praised by imperialism. A U.S. diplomatic official praised Nasser's anti-communist speech as "a more powerful weapon than the Eisenhower Doctrine." This sentence really explains the whole truth. But the people of the UAR, the people of the Arab countries, especially the people of the Arab and African countries who are waging a heroic struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, will not forget the contributions of the communists of the Arab countries and the communists of the world to the national independence struggle of the UAR and the Arab countries, especially will not forget that the Soviet Union is the greatest sympathizer and supporter in the national independence struggle of the UAR and the Arab countries. On the contrary, they know that if they persist in the wrong policy of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, the result can only be a complete surrender to the American, British and French imperialism, and can only be the abandonment of the previous achievements of the national independence cause. This wrong policy can only cause and has already caused the isolation of the UAR, can only cause and has already caused the political and moral bankruptcy of those who persist in this policy.

    There is a crisis in the situation in the Middle East and the peace in the Middle East, and there is a crisis in the development prospects of the cause of national independence of the UAR and the Arab people. In the spirit of consistent friendship towards the UAR and the Arab people, we hope that the UAR authorities can quickly see their own dangerous prospects, resolutely calm down, abandon the misguided policies of anti-Iraq, anti-Arab and anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and return to the patriotic and anti-imperialist road of friendship with Iraq, friendship with the people of the Arab countries, and friendship with the Soviet Union. Only such a road can bring the UAR reliable independence, prosperity, honor and everything that the UAR patriotic people demand. Only such a road can make the cause of independence and unity of the Arab people achieve relatively smooth progress.
