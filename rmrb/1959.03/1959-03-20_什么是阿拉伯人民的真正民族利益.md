Editorial:

    After the suppression of the Shawwaf rebellion, the whole of Iraq rejoiced, and the people were filled with happiness. At the same time, all those who support national independence, support peaceful coexistence, oppose imperialism, and oppose aggressive policies all over the world also expressed their heartfelt congratulations on the victory of the Iraqi people. At this time, the imperialists openly expressed their regret over the failure of the Shawwaf rebellion. In particular, the United States imperialism, which had just signed a military agreement with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan that endangers the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and tried to carry out the conspiracy of armed intervention in Iraq that failed last summer, made no secret of its deep-rooted hostility towards the Republic of Iraq. They are now bragging and trying to cover up their aggressive aims with the guise of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, and hope to use this to lead the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Arab countries, astray, so as to reap the benefits. This is, of course, not surprising.

    However, what is surprising is the attitude taken by the United Arab Republic towards Iraq. Recently, especially after the Shawwaf rebellion, the propaganda organs of Cairo and Damascus launched a fanatical movement to attack the Republic of Iraq. They called the Shawwaf rebellion conspiracy a "revolution," called the traitor Shawwaf a "revolutionary leader," and widely disseminated the "communiqués" of the rebels. At the same time, in the Syrian region and the Egyptian region of the UAR authorities, they even held demonstrative funerals for the Shawwaf clique, inciting the masses to hate Iraq and "overthrow Qasim." In recent days, UAR President Nasser has personally come forward to deliver speeches repeatedly, fiercely attacking the Qasim government of Iraq. He slandered Qasim as a "traitor" and "dictator," saying that "Qasim will suffer a fate similar to that of Nuri al-Said," and tried his best to praise Ali Arif, Shawwaf and others who betrayed Iraqi national independence, and openly declared that a new Mosul rebellion would occur in Iraq. In these speeches, Nasser also attacked the communists of Iraq and Arab countries, slandering them as "foreign agents," insisting that they were trying to eliminate nationalism and were hostile to all Arab countries. All these practices, which are very rare in international relations, have created a tense situation between the UAR and Iraq, and have aroused the concern of all friends of the UAR and Iraq, of the entire Arab countries, and of all friends of the cause of national independence in Asia and Africa. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and the public opinion of many peaceful and neutral countries have expressed concern about the current tense situation between Iraq and the UAR. On March 16, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev delivered a speech while receiving the Iraqi government delegation, expressing the hope in a warm and friendly manner that reason would prevail in the relations between Iraq and the UAR, and that every effort would be made to eliminate the conflict between these two Arab countries, so that this conflict would not be exploited by the imperialists. We fully support this wise advice that is beneficial to all Arab people, and deeply hope that this friendly wish will eventually become a reality.

    It is regrettable that President Nasser immediately issued a statement on the evening of the 16th. In this statement, he not only rejected Khrushchev's advice, but also, in fact, wanted the people of the UAR to forget the Soviet Union's consistent selfless assistance and non-interference in internal affairs to Egypt, Syria, and the UAR, implying that the Soviet Union was hindering the independence of the UAR, and inciting the people of the UAR to rise up against the so-called "provocations" from the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the official Middle East News Agency of the UAR and Cairo Radio openly published absurd comments, saying that Arab nationalism had launched an open struggle against so-called "communist imperialism," that the Arab Communist Party was a "Moscow agent," and that communism was the "number one enemy of Arab nationalism," and so on.

    At almost the same time, the mouthpiece of U.S. imperialism, "The New York Times," wrote in almost the same tone: "What worries us most today is the infiltration of communism... The entire concept of Arab nationalism is in danger... Nasser has lost a battle, and so has the West. Foresight and vigilance are needed to ensure that the Russians do not win a major battle." U.S. imperialism is obviously adding fuel to the fire. The U.S. imperialism, which occupied Lebanon and Britain occupied Jordan with full arms last July, has become a protector of Arab nationalism in the blink of an eye. Isn't this worthy of deep thought and vigilance? We Chinese people have forged a deep friendship with the Arab people in the struggle against aggression and for independence in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, Algeria and all other Arab countries. Our past fate is the same, and now we are still facing the same imperialist aggression and threats. Precisely because of this situation, we cannot but express great concern about the current situation between the UAR and Iraq, as well as the entire Middle East situation.

    We have always believed that the five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, should be the basic norms of international relations. Our country, the UAR, and many other Asian and African countries all recognize these principles. The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in January 1958 both declared the Ten Principles based on the spirit of the Five Principles. These principles stipulate: respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations; non-interference or intervention in the internal affairs of other countries; no country to exert pressure on other countries; not to threaten or use force by acts of aggression to violate the territorial integrity or political independence of any country; resolve international disputes through peaceful means; and so on. In the past, the UAR not only advocated these principles, but also fought for them when the imperialist countries violated these principles against Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and other countries, and thus won the sympathy and respect of the world. What is the situation today?

    The current movement against Iraq by the UAR, in any case, cannot be considered to be in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence, nor can it be considered to be in line with the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, non-exertion of pressure, and non-threatening of the political independence of other countries. Even the UAR's spokesmen have always avoided talking about these principles in relation to Iraq. The matter is very clear: it was not Iraq that created the Arif incident and the Shawwaf rebellion in the UAR, it was not the smaller Iraq that was threatening and demanding the merger of the larger UAR, it was not the Prime Minister of Iraq who was plotting to subvert the President of the UAR and threatening that he must overthrown. Even American newspapers that sympathize with Nasser, such as the "New York Herald Tribune," described his attack on Qasim as "unprecedentedly savage." People all over the world have seen that the person who was once interfered in internal affairs is now interfering in the internal affairs of others, the person who was once subjected to pressure is now putting pressure on others, and the person who was once threatened by force and subversion activities is now threatening others with force and subversion activities. No matter what kind of excuse such a person is using, or what kind of excuse he will use in the future, it is always difficult for the world to give him sympathy and respect again, and it is always difficult not to make a new judgment on him based on new facts. It is very clear that all people in the world who advocate peaceful coexistence and oppose interference in internal affairs, will oppose interference and subversion activities against Iraq today, just as they once opposed the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, opposed the US and Britain subverting the governments of Egypt and Syria, and opposed the US and Britain sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan to interfere in the Iraqi revolution. The reason is very simple: such activities threaten normal international relations and threaten peace in the Middle East.

    Some commentators in Cairo are trying to prove that Nasser's position has not changed, but Khrushchev's position has changed, and the position of communists, progressives, and peace advocates in the world has changed. This "proof" is futile. If the interfered becomes the interferer, how can it be said that the position has not changed? And since the position of those who oppose interference has not changed with it, how can the new interferer be supported? If it is supported, then it is changing from the position of upholding the Five Principles to the position of abandoning the Five Principles, from the position of upholding the Bandung Declaration and the Cairo Declaration to the position of abandoning the Bandung Declaration and the Cairo Declaration.

    President Nasser has repeatedly stated that he does not demand the merger of Iraq. This is a good statement. We believe that as long as this statement is earnestly implemented, the relations between Iraq and the UAR will eventually improve. The problem is that the large number of facts in the current Iraq-UAR relations do not conform to the spirit of this statement. The official rhetoric of the UAR, including the rhetoric of President Nasser himself, seems to want to treat all relations between Arab countries, and even the diplomacy and internal affairs of all Arab countries outside the UAR, as the internal affairs of the UAR alone. Whoever wants to express opinions on these issues is interfering in the internal affairs of the UAR, who is violating the independence and dignity of the UAR, and who is to make the UAR and all Arab countries "subordinate" and "join the group." This kind of arbitrariness will not convince anyone, nor will it shut people's mouths. But those who carry out this arbitrary propaganda are unintentionally proving a fact that they are unwilling to directly admit, that is, they regard Iraq's diplomacy and internal affairs as the UAR's diplomacy and internal affairs, that is to say, they not only want to merge Iraq, but simply think that Iraq has already been merged; not only Iraq, but all other Arab countries have been merged. People know that there is no law in the world, and there is no common resolution among the Arab countries, stipulating that all Arab countries are a province of the UAR, must obey the rule of a certain person, and must take the political views of a certain person as political views. Between the Arab countries, peaceful coexistence is still needed, and the Five Principles and Ten Principles still apply, isn't this a fact?

    The representatives of the Arab countries, including Nasser himself, when attending the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, each adopted the declarations of these two conferences in the capacity of independent countries, and did not think that their country was an exception, isn't this a fact? Since this is the case, no government or individual can insist that the diplomacy and internal affairs of Iraq and other Arab countries must be "subordinate" to the UAR, and other countries' support for Iraq and other Arab countries is interfering in the internal affairs of the UAR, and is to make the UAR "subordinate." Isn't all this as clear as the sun in the sky?

    The broad masses of the Arab countries hope that one day they can get rid of the control of imperialism and realize the unification of the Arabs according to their own wishes. This is a good wish, and we sympathize with this wish. But the more we want to realize this wish, the more we must abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs, because only in this way can we easily eliminate differences and strengthen mutual trust and unity. Khrushchev pointed out in his speech on the 16th that it is a complicated issue for several countries to unite into one country. Only when all the characteristics of the countries implementing the union are valued can the union of countries bring benefits to the people. A union imposed on the people will make the people of a country participating in the union increasingly feel the loss of their own independence, then what will happen is not the strengthening of unity, but the division of forces, which will only benefit the imperialists. What a sincere voice of friends of the UAR and friends of the Arab people! Even if this voice is temporarily brutally distorted by some people in the UAR, it will eventually show the power of its truth. Hasn't the fact already proved the undoubted correctness of this advice? The UAR's recent statements and actions towards Iraq and some other Arab countries have not promoted the progress of Arab unity, but have seriously damaged the progress of Arab unity, and have not narrowed the differences and doubts that originally existed, but have widened these differences and doubts. The prestige of the UAR among the Arab countries has not risen but has fallen, and the friends of the UAR have not increased but have decreased. The only ones who are happy about this situation are the imperialists and their Yugoslav echoes. Is this the national interest of the Arab people? Moreover, is this the national interest of the UAR?

    The spokesmen of the UAR said that they attacked Iraq because Iraq was under the control of communism, and communism is prohibited by the government of the UAR. We have already said that no one has given the UAR a privilege to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. At the same time, it is also nonsense to say that Iraq is under the control of communism. The UAR authorities accuse Iraq of "terror" and "dictatorship," which is particularly regrettable, because this inevitably leads people to compare the situations of the two countries. We have no intention of commenting here on issues that truly belong to the scope of the UAR's internal affairs. But when it comes to Iraq, people cannot help but see how great a power Iraq's democratization cause has shown in the struggle to defend national independence, even though it is still in its infancy. If it were not for relying on democracy, not relying on the people, the Republic of Iraq would have been unable to withstand the repeated attacks of domestic and foreign reactionary forces. The example of Iraq illustrates to the patriots of all Arab countries and all Asian and African countries that in order to safeguard their national independence, in order to consolidate their national unity, and in order to develop their national interests, what is needed is not to implement terror and autocracy, not to suppress democracy, but precisely to develop democracy. The reason is very clear: whoever does not rely on imperialism and its running dogs, the reactionary forces, whoever wants to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and the reactionary forces, must resolutely rely on the people.

    What is incomprehensible is that the Iraqi people have overthrown tyranny and begun to realize democracy, why would this cause tension between Iraq and the UAR? In order to realize the unification of the Arabs, of course, we must first assist the people of Algeria, Jordan, Oman and other countries under direct imperialist aggression to gain independence, why is Iraq, which has already achieved independence, taken as the first goal at present? When the anti-imperialist struggle of various oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially Africa where Cairo is located, is rising and continuing to grow, the UAR authorities, who once stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, are silent about imperialist aggression, while conducting such a fierce attack on Iraq in West Asia, which is determined to oppose imperialism, what exactly is going on? Everyone knows that after a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, the Iraqi people finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty, the agent of imperialism, on July 14, 1958, and established an independent and free republic. The victory of the Iraqi revolution shattered an aggressive cornerstone of imperialism in the Middle East and created more favorable conditions for the struggle of the Arab people for national liberation. Therefore, defending the fruits of this revolution is not only the sacred mission of the Iraqi people, but also the common mission of the Arab people. From the first day of the birth of the Republic of Iraq, imperialism regarded it as a thorn in its side and never stopped its subversion and sabotage activities against Iraq. However, the Iraqi people have stood up. Under the leadership of the government headed by Prime Minister Qasim, they are united and determined to defend their national independence, and have repeatedly crushed the subversive conspiracies of imperialism and foreign aggressive forces. The government of the Republic of Iraq adheres to the principles of the Bandung Conference, pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, and actively advocates solidarity and cooperation with the people of the Arab countries. All these have been warmly supported by the Iraqi people. It is not difficult to judge that in this case, the attack on Iraq is suitable for the national interests of the Arab people, or for the interests of the common enemy of the Arab people, imperialism. For a long time, imperialism has been trying to provoke relations between Arab countries and implement the policy of "using Arabs to fight Arabs" and "divide and rule." Especially after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, in order to isolate the Republic of Iraq and realize its plan of breaking them one by one, it has tried every means to make the UAR and Iraq conflict. This plan of US imperialism was obviously achieved some progress after US special envoy Rountree visited the Middle East last December. People have seen that since then, the official and semi-official propaganda organs of the UAR no longer seriously oppose the American and British imperialism; on the contrary, they even spread the argument that the anti-imperialist task has been completed, and concentrated the firepower of attack on Iraq, which imperialism hates most in the Middle East. This fact can of course only arouse the unease of all sincere anti-imperialist fighters and all sincere Arab patriots. People can't help but ask: What will all this bring to the UAR and the Arab world?

    When the UAR authorities stopped the anti-imperialist struggle and carried out the anti-Iraq struggle, they also launched a fierce anti-communist campaign, which is not surprising to us. The people of our country know from their own history that whoever leaves the position of the people and the position of anti-imperialism will inevitably oppose communism, because the Communist Party is the most loyal defender of the interests of the people and the most determined fighter against imperialism. The people of our country also know deeply that this is contrary to the national interests of the UAR, just as Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communism once greatly helped the Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. But the issue that the people of our country are most concerned about is that the UAR authorities' anti-communism is far from being limited to domestic issues. First, they opposed the communists outside the UAR from the beginning. Secondly, they slandered the communists as "foreign agents," and now they directly slandered the communists as agents of the Soviet Union, and directly slandered the Soviet Union as so-called "communist imperialism," thus they have combined anti-communism with anti-Sovietism. This kind of behavior by the UAR authorities is of course praised by imperialism. A U.S. diplomatic official praised Nasser's anti-communist speech as "a more powerful weapon than the Eisenhower Doctrine." This sentence really explains the whole truth. But the people of the UAR, the people of the Arab countries, especially the people of the Arab and African countries who are waging a heroic struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, will not forget the contributions of the communists of the Arab countries and the communists of the world to the national independence struggle of the UAR and the Arab countries, especially will not forget that the Soviet Union is the greatest sympathizer and supporter in the national independence struggle of the UAR and the Arab countries. On the contrary, they know that if they persist in the wrong policy of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, the result can only be a complete surrender to the American, British and French imperialism, and can only be the abandonment of the previous achievements of the national independence cause. This wrong policy can only cause and has already caused the isolation of the UAR, can only cause and has already caused the political and moral bankruptcy of those who persist in this policy.

    There is a crisis in the situation in the Middle East and the peace in the Middle East, and there is a crisis in the development prospects of the cause of national independence of the UAR and the Arab people. In the spirit of consistent friendship towards the UAR and the Arab people, we hope that the UAR authorities can quickly see their own dangerous prospects, resolutely calm down, abandon the misguided policies of anti-Iraq, anti-Arab and anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and return to the patriotic and anti-imperialist road of friendship with Iraq, friendship with the people of the Arab countries, and friendship with the Soviet Union. Only such a road can bring the UAR reliable independence, prosperity, honor and everything that the UAR patriotic people demand. Only such a road can make the cause of independence and unity of the Arab people achieve relatively smooth progress.

### 什么是阿拉伯人民的真正民族利益

    什么是阿拉伯人民的真正民族利益
    沙瓦夫叛乱被扑灭以后，伊拉克全国欢腾，人心为之大快。同时，在全世界，一切支持民族独立、支持和平共处、反对帝国主义、反对侵略政策的人们，也无不对伊拉克人民的胜利表示衷心祝贺。在这个时候，帝国主义者却公开流露了他们对沙瓦夫叛乱失败的惋惜心情。特别是刚刚同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订了危害中东各国人民的军事协定、力图把去年夏天未能实现的武装干涉伊拉克的阴谋进行到底的美帝国主义者，毫不掩饰他们对伊拉克共和国的根深蒂固的敌视。他们现在大吹大擂，竭力用反共和反苏的幌子来掩盖他们的侵略目的，并且希望借此把中东各国首先是阿拉伯各国引入迷途，以便坐收渔人之利。这当然是不足为奇的。
    但是，使人感到惊讶的是阿拉伯联合共和国对伊拉克所采取的态度。最近期间，特别是沙瓦夫叛乱事件发生以后，开罗和大马士革的宣传机关发动了一个攻击伊拉克共和国的狂热的运动。它们把沙瓦夫叛乱阴谋称为“革命”，把叛国犯沙瓦夫称为“革命领袖”，并广泛传播叛乱者造反的“公报”。同时，在叙利亚地区和埃及地区的阿联当局，竟然为沙瓦夫之流举行示威性的葬礼，煽动群众仇视伊拉克，“打倒卡塞姆”。最近几天，阿联总统纳赛尔亲自出面三番五次地发表演说，猛烈攻击伊拉克的卡塞姆政府。他污蔑卡塞姆是“卖国贼”和“独裁者”，说
  “卡塞姆将遭到与努里·赛义德所遭到的相似的命运”，并且竭力歌颂叛卖伊拉克民族独立的阿里夫、沙瓦夫之流，公开声言在伊拉克还将发生新的摩苏尔叛乱。纳赛尔在这些演说中，也攻击了伊拉克和阿拉伯各国的共产党人，污蔑他们是什么“外国的代理人”，硬说他们企图消灭民族主义，仇视一切阿拉伯国家。所有这些在国际关系中非常少见的做法，造成了阿联同伊拉克之间的紧张局势，并且引起阿联和伊拉克的一切友人们、整个阿拉伯各国和整个亚非各国的民族独立事业的一切友人们的忧虑。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约、印度总理尼赫鲁以及许多和平中立国家的舆论，都对目前阿伊两国间的紧张局势表示不安。3月16日，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在招待伊拉克政府代表团的时候发表讲话，以热烈的友谊态度表示希望，希望在阿伊两国关系中理智将占上风，希望尽一切力量来消除这两个阿拉伯国家之间的冲突，使这种冲突不为帝国主义者所利用。我们完全支持这种有利于全体阿拉伯人民的明智的忠告，并且深切盼望这种友好的愿望将终于成为事实。
    很遗憾，纳赛尔总统在16日夜间随即发表谈话，他在谈话中不但拒绝了赫鲁晓夫的忠告，而且在实际上是要阿联的人民忘却苏联对埃及、叙利亚和阿联的一贯的无私援助和不干涉内政的立场，暗示苏联是在妨碍阿联的独立，并且煽动阿联人民起来反对苏联对于他们的所谓“挑衅”。随后，阿联官方的中东通讯社和开罗电台公然发表荒谬的评论，说什么阿拉伯民族主义同所谓“共产帝国主义”展开了公开的斗争，说什么阿拉伯共产党是“莫斯科代理人”，说什么共产主义是“阿拉伯民族主义的第一号敌人”，等等。
    差不多在同一个时候，美帝国主义的喉舌“纽约时报”用差不多同一个腔调写道：“今天最使我们感到忧虑的是共产主义的渗入。……阿拉伯民族主义的整个概念处在危险中。……纳赛尔打输了一场战斗，西方也是这样。需要深谋远虑和警惕来保证不使俄国人在一场主要的战斗中获胜。”美帝国主义显然是在火上加油。去年7月带着全副武装同英国分别占领黎巴嫩和约旦的美帝国主义，一转眼之间成了阿拉伯民族主义的保护人。这难道还不值得人们深思和警惕么？我们中国人民在埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、也门、阿曼、阿尔及利亚和其他一切阿拉伯国家的反抗侵略、争取独立的斗争中，同阿拉伯人民结成了深厚的友谊。我们的过去的命运是相同的，而现在也同样仍然面对着帝国主义的侵略和威胁。正是由于这种情况，我们对于目前的阿联同伊拉克之间的局势，以及有关的整个中东的局势，不能不表示重大的关切。
    我们从来认为，和平共处的五项原则，即互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处，应当是国际关系的基本准则。我国、阿联和其他许多亚非国家都承认这些原则。1955年4月在万隆举行的亚非会议和1958年1月在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会，都曾经根据五项原则的精神宣布了十项原则。这些原则规定：尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整；不干预或干涉他国内政；任何国家不对其他国家施加压力；不以侵略行为威胁或使用武力来侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立；通过和平方法解决国际争端；等等。阿联在过去不但主张这些原则，并且当帝国主义国家对埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克等国破坏这些原则的时候曾经为之而奋斗，因而获得了世人的同情和尊敬。今天的情况如何呢？
    阿联目前所进行的反对伊拉克的运动，无论如何，不能够认为是符合于和平共处的原则，不能够认为是符合于不干涉内政、不施加压力、不威胁别国政治独立的原则的。甚至阿联的发言人在对伊拉克的关系问题上也始终避而不谈这些原则。事情很清楚：并不是伊拉克在阿联国内制造了阿里夫事件和沙瓦夫叛乱，并不是较小的伊拉克在威胁和要求合并较大的阿联，并不是伊拉克的总理在蓄谋颠复阿联的总统，并且威胁说他一定要被推翻。甚至同情纳赛尔的美国报纸，例如“纽约先驱论坛报”也把他对卡塞姆的攻击描写为“空前野蛮的”。全世界的人都看到：昔日被干涉内政的人今日在干涉别人的内政，昔日被施加压力的人今日在对别人施加压力，昔日被武力和颠复活动威胁的人今日在以武力和颠复活动威胁别人。无论这样的人在利用着怎样的借口，或者今后还会利用怎样的借口，但是世人总难于再对他报以同情和尊敬，总难于不根据新的事实对他作出新的判断。很明显，全世界一切主张和平共处、反对干涉内政的人们，以前曾经怎样反对英法以侵略埃及、反对美英颠复埃及政府和叙利亚政府、反对美英出兵黎巴嫩和约旦而干涉伊拉克革命，在今天也将怎样反对对于伊拉克的干涉和颠复活动。原因很简单：这样的活动威胁着正常的国际关系，威胁着中东的和平。
    开罗的一些评论家企图证明：纳赛尔的立场没有变，可是赫鲁晓夫的立场变了，世界上的共产主义者、进步人士、和平人士的立场变了。这种“证明”是徒劳无益的。如果被干涉者变为干涉者，怎么能说是立场没有变呢？而反对干涉的人们的立场并没有随之而改变，那怎么可以对新的干涉者加以支持呢？如果加以支持，那才是由维护五项原则的立场变为背弃五项原则的立场，由维护万隆宣言、开罗宣言的立场变为背弃万隆宣言、开罗宣言的立场。
    纳赛尔总统一再声明，他并不要求合并伊拉克。这是一个好声明。我们相信，只要认真实行这个声明，阿伊两国关系终将好转。问题是目前阿伊关系中的大量事实同这个声明的精神并不符合。阿联的官方言论，包括纳赛尔总统本人的言论在内，似乎想把阿拉伯国家间的一切关系以至阿联以外的一切阿拉伯国家的外交、内政都说成是阿联一国的内政，谁要对这些问题发表意见，谁就是干涉了阿联的内政，谁就是侵犯了阿联的独立和尊严，谁就是要使阿联和一切阿拉伯国家“处于从属地位”和“加入集团”。这种武断是不会使任何人信服的，也不会因此就堵住了人的嘴巴。但是进行这种武断宣传的人们却在无意中证明了他们所不愿意直接承认的一个事实，即他们把伊拉克的外交、内政看作阿联的外交内政，也就是说，他们不但想要合并伊拉克，而且简直认为伊拉克已经被合并了；不但伊拉克，而且一切其他阿拉伯国家都已经被合并了。人们知道，世界上并没有任何一种法律，阿拉伯各国也没有任何一种共同的决议，规定所有阿拉伯国家都是阿联的一省，都要服从某一个人的统治，都要以某一个人的政治主张为政治主张。在阿拉伯各国之间，仍然需要和平共处，仍然适用五项原则和十项原则，这难道不是事实吗？
  阿拉伯各国的代表，包括纳赛尔本人在内，在出席万隆会议和开罗会议的时候，各自以独立国的身份通过了这两个会议的宣言，而并没有认为自己的国家是例外，这难道不是事实吗？既然这样，就没有一个政府或一个个人能够硬说伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家的外交内政必须对于阿联“处于从属地位”，而别的国家对于伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家表示支持，就是什么干涉阿联的内政，就是什么要阿联“处于从属地位”。这一切难道不是明白得像晴天的太阳一样吗？
    阿拉伯各国的广大人民希望在某一天能够摆脱帝国主义的控制，根据自己的意愿，实现阿拉伯的统一。这是一个良好的愿望，我们对于这个愿望寄予同情。但是愈要实现这个愿望，就愈要遵守和平共处和不干涉内政的原则，因为只有这样，才便于消除彼此的分歧，加强相互的信任和团结。赫鲁晓夫在16日的讲话指出：几个国家联合成一个国家，这是一个复杂的问题。只有当实行联合的各国的一切特点都得到重视的时候，国家的联合才能给人民带来好处。强加给人民的联合，会使参加联合的一个国家的人民越来越尖锐地开始感觉到本国独立的丧失，那么，所发生的将不是团结的加强，而是力量的分裂，将只对帝国主义者有利。这是阿联的友人和阿拉伯人民的友人的多么真挚的声音！这个声音即令暂时在阿联受到某些人的粗暴的歪曲，终将显示出它的真理的力量。事实难道不是已经证明了这个忠言的无可怀疑的正确吗？阿联最近时期对伊拉克和其他一些阿拉伯国家的言论行动，不是促进了阿拉伯团结的进展，而是严重地损害了阿拉伯团结的进展，不是缩小了本来存在着的分歧和疑虑，而是使这些分歧和疑虑扩大化。阿联在阿拉伯各国之间的威信不是上升了而是下降了，阿联的朋友不是增多了而是减少了。对于这种情况高兴的，只有帝国主义者和他们的南斯拉夫应声虫。这难道是阿拉伯人民的民族利益吗？而且，这难道是阿联的民族利益吗？
    阿联的发言人说他们所以攻击伊拉克，是因为伊拉克受到了什么共产主义的控制，而共产主义是阿联政府所禁止的。我们已经说过，没有任何人给阿联以一种干涉伊拉克内政的特权。同时，说伊拉克受到了什么共产主义的控制也是一种无稽之谈。阿联当局指责伊拉克出现了“恐怖”和“专政”，这种指责特别令人遗憾，因为这难免引起人们把两个国家的状况加以比较。我们无意在这里评论真正属于阿联内政范围的问题。但是说到伊拉克，人们不能不看到，伊拉克的民主化事业虽然还在开始，但是已经在保卫民族独立的斗争中显示了多么伟大的力量。如果不是依靠民主，不是依靠人民，伊拉克共和国早就在国内外反动势力的再三夹攻中支持不住了。伊拉克的例子向一切阿拉伯国家和一切亚非国家的爱国者说明，为了维护本国的民族独立，为了巩固本国的民族团结，为了发展本国的民族利益，所需要的不是施行恐怖和专制，不是压制民主，而恰恰是发展民主。道理很清楚：谁要不依靠帝国主义及其走狗反动势力，谁要同帝国主义和反动势力作坚决斗争，谁就不能不坚决地依靠人民。
    令人难以理解的是，伊拉克人民推翻了专制，开始实现了民主，为什么会造成阿伊两国之间的紧张关系呢？为了实现阿拉伯的统一，当然首先要援助那些在帝国主义直接侵略下的阿尔及利亚、约旦、阿曼等国人民得到独立，为什么会把已经取得独立的伊拉克作为当前第一个目标呢？当亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，特别是开罗所在的非洲，各被压迫民族反帝国主义斗争风起云涌、继续增长的时候，曾经站在反帝斗争前线的阿联当局，却对帝国主义的侵略表示沉默，而对西亚坚决反帝国主义的伊拉克进行如此猛烈的攻击，这究竟是怎么一回事呢？大家知道，伊拉克人民经过长期的艰苦的革命斗争，终于在1958年7月14日推翻了帝国主义及其代理人费萨尔王朝的反动统治，建立了独立自由的共和国。伊拉克革命的胜利，打碎了帝国主义在中东的一个侵略基石，给阿拉伯各国人民争取民族解放斗争创造了更为有利的条件。因此，保卫这个革命的胜利果实，不仅是伊拉克人民的神圣使命，而且也是阿拉伯各国人民的共同使命。自从伊拉克共和国诞生的第一天起，帝国主义就把它视为眼中钉，从来没有停止过对伊拉克的颠复和破坏活动。但是，伊拉克人民是站起来了，他们在以卡塞姆总理为首的政府的领导下，团结一致，坚决捍卫自己的民族独立，一次又一次地粉碎了帝国主义和外国侵略势力的颠复阴谋。伊拉克共和国政府坚持执行万隆会议的原则，奉行和平中立的政策，并积极主张同阿拉伯各国人民团结合作。所有这些，都获得伊拉克人民的热烈拥护。不难判断，在这种情况下，对于伊拉克的攻击，究竟是适合于阿拉伯人民的民族利益，还是适合于阿拉伯人民的共同敌人帝国主义的利益。长期以来，帝国主义就极力挑拨阿拉伯各国之间的关系，推行“用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人”和“分而治之”的政策。特别在伊拉克共和国成立以后，帝国主义为了把伊拉克共和国孤立起来，以实现其各个击破的计划，它就想尽办法使阿联和伊拉克发生冲突。美帝国主义的这个计划，在美国特使朗特里去年12月间访问中东以后，显然是得到了某种进展。人们看到，从那时以来，阿联的官方、半官方的宣传机关就不再认真地反对美英帝国主义了；相反，它们甚至散布反帝国主义任务已经完成的论调，而把攻击的火力集中到帝国主义在中东最痛恨的伊拉克。这个事实，当然只能引起一切真诚的反帝国主义战士和一切真诚的阿拉伯爱国者的不安。人们不禁要问：这一切究竟会给阿联和阿拉伯世界带来什么结局？
    阿联当局在停止反帝国主义斗争而进行反伊拉克斗争的时候，同时开展了猛烈的反共活动，这对于我们说来是毫不奇怪的。我国人民从自己的历史中知道，谁要离开了人民的立场、反帝国主义的立场，谁就免不了要反共，因为共产党是人民利益的最忠诚的保卫者和反帝国主义的最坚决的战士。我国人民也深知，这是同阿联的民族利益相违反的，如同蒋介石的反共曾经大大帮助日本帝国主义对于中国的侵略一样。但是我国人民最关切的问题是：阿联当局的反共远不以内政问题为限。首先，他们一开始就反对阿联以外的共产党人。其次，他们污蔑共产党人是什么“外国的代理人”，现在更直接污蔑共产党人是苏联的代理人，并且直接污蔑苏联是所谓“共产帝国主义”，因而他们已经把反共同反苏结合在一起了。阿联当局的这种行为，当然要受到帝国主义的喝采。美国外交官员称赞纳赛尔的反共演说是“比艾森豪威尔主义更有力的武器”。这真是一句话就说明了全部的真相。但是阿联的人民，阿拉伯各国的人民，特别是那些正在同帝国主义及其走狗进行着英勇斗争的阿拉伯国家和亚非国家的人民，不会忘记阿拉伯各国共产党人和全世界共产党人对于阿联和阿拉伯各国民族独立斗争的贡献，尤其不会忘记苏联是阿联和阿拉伯各国民族独立斗争中的最伟大的同情者、支持者。相反，他们知道，如果坚持反苏反共的错误政策，结果就只能是对于美英法帝国主义的彻底投降，只能是民族独立事业的前功尽弃。这种错误政策只会造成而且已经在造成阿联的孤立，只会造成而且已经在造成那些坚持这一政策的人们在政治上和道义上的破产。
    中东的局势和中东的和平存在着危机，阿联和阿拉伯人民的民族独立事业的发展前景存在着危机。本着对于阿联和阿拉伯人民的一贯友谊，我们希望阿联当局能够迅速看到自己的危险的前景，毅然冷静下来，放弃反伊拉克、反阿拉伯和反苏反共的误国政策，回到同伊拉克友好、同阿拉伯各国人民友好、同苏联友好的爱国反帝道路。只有这样的道路，才能带给阿联以可靠的独立、强盛、荣誉和阿联爱国人民所要求的一切。也只有这样的道路，才能使阿拉伯人民的独立事业和团结事业得到比较顺利的进展。
