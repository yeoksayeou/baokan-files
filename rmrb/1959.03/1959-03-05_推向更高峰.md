    Pushing to Even Greater Heights
    Chu Xue
    As spring thunder rumbles in nature, the industrial front is already blossoming with countless magnificent scenes. Triumphant news of completing February's plan ahead of schedule is pouring in, and the competition to win the first quarter is in full swing.

    This year's vigorous and thriving leap forward landscape, like the spring breeze, comes very naturally.

    The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 are manifested in all aspects, but to summarize, the most important one is that it created a situation for the Great Leap Forward in 1959 and for the Great Leap Forward year after year in the future.

    Let's look at this year. This year will definitely be an even greater leap forward year. Why? Just look at the following conditions: This year, the masses are full of energy and enthusiasm; we have the valuable experience of achieving the Great Leap Forward last year; this year's targets are both targets for a greater leap forward and realistic targets; this year's Great Leap Forward situation came very early and was launched at the beginning of the year; with the People's Communes, the state can better incorporate various tasks into planning; we are using leadership methods that are tight from the beginning and throughout the entire process.... With so many favorable conditions, a greater leap forward is an objective inevitability.

    The overall situation is very good. How should enterprise leaders seize this favorable situation and push production to even greater heights? This requires leadership art, going to the masses, leading the masses, and transforming the activities of the masses into a more organized and led mass movement.

    Waging mass movements is our fundamental method of engaging in revolution and construction, and it is also an opportunity to mobilize various positive factors. The people are the masters of the cause of revolution and construction. In socialist construction, the broad masses of people are enthusiastic and have infinite potential for leap forward. How can this potential be fully exploited? Past experience, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, tells us that as long as we conscientiously implement the mass line and combine centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, the infinite potential hidden in the masses will be transformed into the power to "move mountains and overturn seas." When the broad masses are mobilized, the material conditions such as machinery and equipment can also be "handled with ease," and even if some difficulties are encountered, they can be readily solved. In this way, the realization of the leap forward plan can be secured. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 fully proved this truth.

    Many units have grasped the link of vigorously launching mass movements at the beginning of the year, making production and construction advance rapidly and continuously. Many units have recently launched new production upsurges by mobilizing the masses. The news from Anshan Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and Daye Steel Plant reported in this newspaper today are some examples. The higher the new production upsurge rises, the smoother this year's leap forward plan will be completed.

    推向更高峰
    楚雪
    自然界春雷初动，工业战线上已是花开朵朵，气象万千。提前完成2月份计划的捷报纷至沓来，争取首季全胜的竞赛轰轰烈烈。
    今年这一蓬蓬勃勃的跃进景色，像春风一样来得很自然。
    1958年的大跃进的巨大成就表现在各个方面，但概括起来，最重要的一条，是为1959年的大跃进、为今后年年大跃进造成了形势。
    且看今年。今年肯定是个更大的跃进年。为什么？看一看下面的条件就知道了：今年群众干劲十足，热情很高；有了去年实现大跃进的宝贵经验；今年的指标既是更大跃进的指标，又是实事求是的指标；今年大跃进的形势来得很早，从年初就发动起来了；有了人民公社，国家更能把各种工作更好地纳入规划；运用了一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧的领导方法……。有这么多有利条件，更大跃进已是客观的必然性了。
    总的形势好得很。企业领导人员应该怎样抓住这个良好形势，把生产推向更高峰呢？这就要发挥领导艺术，到群众中去，领导群众，把群众的活动变成更加有组织有领导的群众运动。
    大搞群众运动，是我们从事革命和建设的基本方法，也是调动各种积极因素的契机。人民群众是革命和建设事业的主人。在社会主义建设中，广大群众热情洋溢，有着无穷的跃进潜力。怎样使这种潜在力量充分发挥出来呢？以往的特别是去年大跃进的经验告诉我们：只要认真贯彻群众路线，把集中领导和大搞群众运动结合起来，蕴藏在群众中的无穷潜力，就会变成“移山倒海”的力量。当广大群众被发动起来以后，机器设备等物的条件也能“得心应手”，即便遇到某些困难，也能迎刃而解。这样，跃进计划的实现就能稳操胜券了。1958年的大跃进，充分地证实了这一真理。
    不少单位在年初就抓紧了大搞群众运动这一环节，使生产建设如快马飞奔，不断跃进。许多单位最近发动群众掀起了新的生产高潮。今天本报报道的鞍钢、重钢、太钢、大冶钢厂的消息，便是其中的一些例子。新的生产高潮越高涨，今年的跃进计划就将更顺利地完成。
