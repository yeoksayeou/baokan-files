    Notes
    Right and Wrong
    The American magazine "Time" quoted an American official as saying, "The United States has wasted 129 million US dollars in Bolivia." This statement is indeed a great insult to the Bolivian people.

    However, judging from the reaction this statement has caused in Bolivia, it does not seem entirely unreasonable. If the United States really spent money in Bolivia, the purpose of its spending was undoubtedly to deceive the Bolivian people and control Bolivia's political and economic life. The large anti-American demonstrations that broke out in La Paz proved that the Bolivian people were not deceived by American "aid," so it can also be said that the United States' money was "wasted."

    However, the United States' money has not actually been "wasted." It is a well-known fact that for every dollar the United States invests in Latin America, it reaps two dollars in profit each year. If the United States really spent 129 million US dollars in Bolivia, then billions of dollars have already returned to the pockets of American "philanthropists." This is precisely why the Bolivian people hate the United States so deeply.
    
    Counterproductive
    On March 2nd, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy, when talking about the West Berlin issue, said that the U.S. policy is "not to launch an offensive first." But then, he made two annotations to this policy: First, he believed that although the policy is stipulated in this way, "whether to do so or not is another matter"; second, "the U.S. policy is not to launch an offensive first with large-scale weapons," in other words, if "medium" or "small" weapons are used, naturally it is not included.
    
    It seems that McElroy probably wanted to achieve two goals with one arrow: both to make people believe that the United States loves peace, and to use the means of war threats to intimidate people on the West Berlin issue. But the result was counterproductive. Since McElroy himself declared that the so-called U.S. policy of "not launching an offensive first" is just empty talk, then how can he deceive anyone? Since McElroy cannot be unaware that even if the United States uses "large-scale weapons," it will not scare anyone, then will using "medium" or "small" weapons have any effect?

    札记 
    也对也不对
    美国“时代”周刊援引一名美国官员的话说：“美国在玻利维亚白白耗费了一亿二千九百万美元。”这句话对玻利维亚人民实在是一个极大的侮辱。
    但是从这番话在玻利维亚所引起的反应来说，似乎也不无一定的道理。如果美国真的在玻利维亚花了钱的话，它花钱的目的无疑是在于欺骗玻利维亚人民，控制玻利维亚的政治和经济生活。而拉巴斯爆发的反美大示威，证明了玻利维亚人民并没有被美国的“援助”所欺骗，因此也可以说美国的钱是“白白耗费”了。
    然而，美国的钱其实并没有“白白耗费”。美国在拉丁美洲投下每一块美元，每年收回两块美元的利润，这已是众所周知的事实。如果美国真的在玻利维亚花了一亿二千九百万美元的话，早已有十数亿美元回到美国“慈善家”的口袋里去了。这正是为什么玻利维亚人民对美国所以如此恨之入骨的原因。
    弄巧成拙
    3月2日，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在谈到西柏林问题时说，美国的政策是“不首先发动进攻”。但，接着他就给这种政策作了两个注解：第一，他认为，政策虽然是这样规定的，可是“是否这样做，那是另一个问题”；第二，“美国的政策是不首先以大型武器发动进攻”，换句话说，如果使用“中型”或“小型”武器，自然不在此例。
    看来麦克耳罗伊大概想要达到一箭双雕的目的：既能使人相信美国是爱好和平的，又能在西柏林问题上施用战争威胁手段来吓唬人。但结果却弄巧成拙。麦克耳罗伊既然自己宣布美国所谓“不首先发动进攻”的政策不过是一句空话，那么又怎能欺骗任何人呢？麦克耳罗伊既然不会不知道，即使美国用“大型武器”也吓不倒什么人，那么用“中型”或“小型”武器难道就会有什么作用吗？
