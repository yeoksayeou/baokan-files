Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: To guarantee the vegetable supply for the capital, people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are resolutely implementing the policy of "suburban agricultural production serving the city" and are making every effort to develop vegetable production. At present, the broad masses of commune members are delivering manure, leveling the land, and rushing to plant early spring vegetables, striving for a bumper vegetable harvest throughout the year.

This year, the planned vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of Beijing is to be doubled compared to last year. Many commune party secretaries are personally taking charge, formulating annual vegetable production increase plans and specific measures. The Sijiqing People's Commune in Haidian District has already prepared enough vegetable seedlings for spring and summer vegetable planting, and the variety of vegetables will increase from 140 last year to 234 this year. The Lugouqiao People's Commune in Fengtai District has prepared an average of more than 38,000 jin of fertilizer per mu for spring and summer vegetables. These communes prioritize the needs of vegetable field production in the allocation and use of production materials such as fertilizer, water pumping equipment, insulation equipment, and transportation tools. In the spirit of self-reliance, they have expanded the production of vegetable seeds to meet the needs of vegetable seeds for this autumn and next spring.

In order to balance the supply during peak and off-peak seasons, the near suburbs will grow more quick-maturing vegetables, while the far suburbs will grow more storage-resistant and transport-resistant vegetables such as potatoes, Chinese cabbage, and radishes. Communes are also universally implementing staggered sowing to facilitate phased harvesting and supply market needs.

Many communes have established technical research groups, and with the assistance of the Beijing Vegetable Science Research Institute and nearby universities, they are combining production, summarizing the experience of veteran vegetable farmers, and conducting research on vegetable cultivation management. An advanced method of potato seedling bud planting is being widely promoted. This method saves seeds, increases yield, and can bring potatoes to market earlier.

In the upsurge of vegetable production, in addition to vigorously grasping the sowing of early spring vegetables, communes have also strengthened the management of greenhouse and sun-warmed planting bed vegetables. In some communes, the Chinese cabbage, bok choy, and small radishes planted in sun-warmed planting beds have already begun to be harvested, supplying the market half a month earlier than last year.

    保证首都蔬菜供应
    北京郊区扩大种植面积分期播种
    据新华社讯　北京市郊区各人民公社坚决执行“郊区农业生产为城市服务”的方针，千方百计地发展蔬菜生产，以保证首都人民的蔬菜供应。目前，广大公社社员正在送粪、平地、抢种早春蔬菜，力争全年蔬菜大丰收。
    今年北京市郊区的蔬菜播种面积计划比去年扩大了一倍。许多公社党委书记亲自挂帅，制定出全年蔬菜增产计划和具体措施。海淀区四季青人民公社已经为春夏蔬菜种植准备了足够的菜苗，蔬菜品种将从去年的一百四十种增加到今年的二百三十四种。丰台区芦沟桥人民公社为春夏菜准备的肥料平均每亩已有三万八千多斤。这些公社在肥料、抽水设备、保温设备、运输工具等生产资料的分配使用方面，都优先供应菜田生产的需要，并本着自给精神，扩大了菜种的生产，以便满足今年秋天和明年春天菜种的需要。
    为了均衡淡旺季的供应，近郊区将多种快熟蔬菜，远郊区多种耐贮藏、耐运输的土豆、大白菜、罗卜等蔬菜。各公社还普遍实行排开播种，以便分期收获、供应市场需要。
    许多公社成立了技术研究小组，在北京市蔬菜科学研究所和附近的高等学校协助下，结合生产，总结老菜农的经验，进行蔬菜栽培管理的研究。一种土豆育苗芽栽的先进办法正在普遍推广，这种方法省种子、增产量，并且可以使土豆提早上市。
    在蔬菜生产高潮中，各公社除了大抓早春蔬菜播种外，还加强了温室、阳畦蔬菜的管理。有的公社阳畦种的小白菜、小油菜、小罗卜等已开始收获，比去年提前半个月供应市场。
