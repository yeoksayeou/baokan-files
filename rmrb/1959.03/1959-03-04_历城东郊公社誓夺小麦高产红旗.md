The magnificent slogan of "3,000 jin target, 6,000 jin measures, 12,000 jin of effort" has become the action program for all members of the Eastern Suburb People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, for wheat field management. The 55,000 mu of wheat sown last autumn by this commune is planned to yield 3,000 jin per mu, with 1,000 mu of satellite fields required to yield 10,000 jin per mu, and 10,000 mu of high-yield fields required to yield 5,000 jin per mu. At present, a vigorous wheat field management campaign of large-scale topdressing with reviving fertilizer and large-scale watering is in full swing in this commune.

The First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Shu Tong, was temporarily sent down to this commune as a commune member in February. The news that he was transporting fertilizer and applying topdressing fertilizer together with the commune members further encouraged the enthusiasm of all the commune members. They were determined to repay the Party for the honor and care given to them with practical actions to become the first high-yield wheat red flag in the province.

Upon entering this commune, one can see crowds of people transporting fertilizer, accumulating fertilizer, applying topdressing fertilizer, and irrigating wheat fields everywhere. In order to carry out the topdressing fertilizer application as a rush task, people started delivering fertilizer at five o'clock in the morning; when there were not enough livestock, young male and female commune members would wrap up a large cart with eight or nine people, and more than 200 cadres from provincial and municipal government offices who were sent down here would compete with the commune members to pull large carts. The Iron Women's Production Team, composed of 32 young women from the Zhuxin Management Area of this commune, meticulously manages 217 mu of wheat fields, which are generally deep-plowed to a depth of 1.5 to 2 feet, with 100,000 to 200,000 jin of base fertilizer applied, plus three large topdressings and three large waterings, guaranteeing a yield of 7,000 jin per mu, and striving to achieve 10,000 jin.

The measures taken by this commune to strive for a yield of 3,000 jin per mu are: passing five barriers (reviving, jointing, booting, grain-filling, harvesting), preventing four pests (diseases and insect pests, frost, lodging, mildew), grasping both ends (both grasping high-yield and completely eliminating Class III seedlings), and bringing along the middle. In order to successfully achieve the wheat leap forward target, the commune Party committee requires that all wheat fields be harrowed once within 20 days, and that 10,000 jin of coarse and fine fertilizer and 150 to 200 jin of soil fertilizer be applied per mu. In order to ensure timely topdressing and spring sowing, the commune Party committee requires all management areas to vigorously carry out tool reform, to realize the vehicleization, ball bearingization, and rubber tireization of transportation tools, to use ship transportation along the Yellow River and the Xiaoqing River, and to vigorously carry out wooden rails where conditions permit. In order to do a good job in both wheat field management and spring sowing at the same time, they have divided the production leadership into two fronts. Wheat field management is led by Party and administrative cadres at all levels of the commune, management area, and production team. Each laborer is responsible for 5 to 10 mu of wheat, and the entire commune is organized into an 8,000-person wheat field management professional team, implementing a responsibility system that combines the collective and the individual, with tasks assigned to the team, management assigned to the group, measures assigned to the field, and responsibilities assigned to the individual. This ensures that each level is responsible, everyone is responsible, and everyone shares the burden of thousands of catties; the "four assignments to the field" of output targets, yield-increasing measures, costs, and management personnel are implemented, with specific contracting to the end, timely inspection and evaluation, the carrying out of red flag competitions, rewards for exceeding production, and penalties for negligence and relaxation of management leading to reduced production. In terms of spring plowing, each Party and administrative leader is also designated to be responsible for special management.

    历城东郊公社誓夺小麦高产红旗
    本报济南3日电　“三千斤指标，六千斤措施，一万二千斤干劲”的雄伟口号，已变成山东省历城县东郊人民公社全体社员在麦田管理上的行动纲领。这个社去秋播种的五万五千亩小麦，计划亩产三千斤，其中千亩卫星田要求亩产万斤，万亩高额丰产田要求亩产五千斤。目前，一个大追返青肥，大浇返青水的轰轰烈烈的麦田管理运动已经在这个公社全面展开。
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同在2月间短期下放到这个公社当社员，当他和社员们一起运肥追肥的消息传开后，更加鼓舞了全体社员的干劲，他们决心以争取成为全省小麦第一面高产红旗的实际行动，报答党给予他们的荣誉和关怀。
    一进入这个公社，就可以看见到处都是运肥、积肥、追肥、灌溉麦田的人群。为了突击追肥，人们凌晨五点就开始送肥；牲口不够，年青的男女社员就八、九个人包一辆大车，省、市机关下放到这里的二百多干部和社员们一起争着拉大车。这个社祝辛管理区三十二名青年妇女组成的钢铁妇女生产队，由她们精心管理的二百一十七亩麦田，一般都深翻一尺五寸到二尺，施底肥十万到二十万斤，另外又追了三次大肥，浇了三次大水，保证亩产七千斤，力争实现万斤。
    这个社争取亩产三千斤的措施是：过五关（返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆、收割）、防四害（病虫、霜冻、倒伏、霉烂）、抓两头（既抓高额丰产，又要彻底消灭三类苗）、带中间。为了胜利实现小麦跃进指标，社党委要求在二十天内，保证将所有麦田普遍耙一遍，每亩追一万斤粗制细肥，一百五十到二百斤土化肥。为了保证适时追肥和春耕播种，社党委要求各管理区大搞工具改革，运输工具要实现车子化、滚珠轴承化、胶轮化，沿黄河、小清河利用船运，有条件的地方大搞木轨。为使麦田管理和春耕播种同时做好，他们在生产领导上划分了两条战线。麦田管理由公社、管理区、生产队层层党和行政负责干部挂帅，按每个劳力分管五至十亩小麦，全社组成八千人的麦田管理专业队，实行任务到队，管理到组，措施到田，责任到人的集体和个人相结合的责任制。做到层层负责，人人负责，千斤担子众人挑；实行产量指标、增产措施、成本、管理人员“四到田”，具体包干到底，及时检查评比，开展红旗竞赛，超产奖励，失职放松管理减产者处罚。春耕方面，也指定各级党和行政负责人各一人负责专管。
