Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants Continue to Lead in Open Hearth Furnace Utilization Coefficient

(Our Shanghai dispatch, March 27) Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant have held high the national red flag for high-yield open hearth furnaces. In January, the utilization coefficient of the two open hearth furnaces at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant continued to lead the country. Until February, Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, under the slogan of "Learning from No. 3 Plant, Catching up with No. 3 Plant, and Surpassing No. 3 Plant," achieved an open hearth furnace utilization coefficient of 12.27, exceeding No. 3 Plant by 0.14. For the first time, the national high-yield open hearth furnace red flag, held by Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant for more than two years, changed hands and was seized by Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. Entering March, the competition between these two brother workshops has become more active. Open hearth furnace workers at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant learned from the experience of the No. 1 Plant's open hearth furnace and continuously set new records for rapid steelmaking. From March 1st to 20th, the average utilization coefficient exceeded that of No. 1 Plant, reaching over 14.

The high-yield open hearth furnace red flags of Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants have been achieved under conditions of high quality and a wide variety of products. At the beginning of this year, the state not only required these two workshops to increase production, but also assigned them the production tasks of various casting steels, high-quality steels, and alloy steels. Last year, the output of various casting steels at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant only accounted for 20% to 30% of the total steel output, but this year it will reach more than 80%. These steels require very low sulfur content and higher steel temperatures, and some steels are being produced for the first time. The production tasks of the open hearth furnace workshop at Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant this year also include a large quantity of high-quality steel. Although there are many varieties and specifications, and the quality requirements are high, and the production conditions have not changed much, the employees of these two workshops have unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the state. Both workshops have mobilized employees to carry out a great technical revolution, proposing thousands of suggestions, and at the same time learning from each other and exchanging experiences. Due to the employees' high sense of responsibility for completing the national plan, these two workshops have not only completed the variety plan since the beginning of this year, but also continuously improved the quality.

After the Shanghai Municipal Iron and Steel Workers responded to the National High-Yield and High-Quality Steel Competition Broadcasting Conference on March 18, these two workshops further revised their production targets and measures for this year. The open hearth furnace workshop at Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant proposed to further expand furnace output, from the current fifty-five tons to eighty tons; the utilization coefficient should reach over 18 in the second half of the year. Employees of the open hearth furnace workshop at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant also put forward many measures to expand the open hearth furnace capacity from the current forty tons to more than fifty tons; the utilization coefficient should also reach over 18 in the second half of the year.

Currently, the red flag competition between these two workshops has been deeply unfolded. After the Shen Huisheng team of No. 1 open hearth furnace at Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant created a new record of 5 minutes and 16 seconds for smelting a furnace of ordinary steel on March 16, on the 17th, the youth team smelted a furnace of high-quality steel in 5 minutes and 57 seconds, creating a new record since the Great Leap Forward last year. After Han Xinliang's youth steelmaking team at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant created a new record of 4 minutes and 7 seconds for smelting a furnace of casting steel, it was immediately broken by the veteran Sun Wanyin's team with 3 minutes and 57 seconds.

### 上钢一厂三厂平炉利用系数继续领先

    帅府猛将大比武
    平炉红旗在上海上
    上钢一厂三厂平炉利用系数继续领先
    本报上海27日电　今年以来，上海第三钢厂和上海第一钢厂高举全国平炉高产红旗。1月份，上钢三厂两座平炉的利用系数继续在全国领先，直到2月份，上钢一厂在“学三厂、赶三厂、超三厂”的口号下，平炉利用系数达到12.27，超过三厂0.14。上钢三厂连续保持两年多的全国平炉高产红旗第一次易手，被上钢一厂夺去。进入3月份，这两个兄弟车间竞赛活动更加活跃，上钢三厂平炉工人学习了一厂平炉的经验，连创快速炼钢新纪录，3月1日到20日平均利用系数又超过一厂，达到14以上。
    上钢一厂、三厂的平炉高产红旗，都是在优质、多品种的条件下获得的。今年年初，国家不但要求这两个车间提高产量，而且把各种铸件钢、优质钢、合金钢的生产任务交给他们。上钢三厂平炉去年各种铸件钢的产量只占全部钢产量的20％到30％，今年将达到80％以上。这些钢种含硫成分要求很低，钢水温度也较高，有些钢种还是第一次生产。上钢一厂平炉车间今年生产任务中优质钢数量也很大。虽然品种规格多，质量要求高，生产条件没有多少改变，但这两个车间的职工一致表示坚决完成国家分配的任务。两个车间都发动职工大闹技术革命，提出千百条建议，同时互相学习，交流经验。由于职工们对完成国家计划具有高度的责任感，这两个车间今年以来不仅完成了品种计划，而且质量也不断提高。
    在3月18日上海市钢铁职工响应全国钢铁高产优质竞赛广播大会以后，这两个车间进一步修订了今年的生产指标和措施。上钢一厂平炉车间提出要进一步扩大炉产量，从现在的五十五吨提高到八十吨；利用系数在下半年要达到18以上。上钢三厂平炉车间职工也提出了很多措施，要把平炉容量从现在的四十吨扩大到五十吨以上；下半年利用系数也要达到18以上。
    目前，这两个车间的红旗竞赛已经深入展开。上钢一厂一号平炉沈惠生小组在3月16日以五点十六分钟创造出炼一炉普通钢的新纪录后，17日，青年班又以五点五十七分钟炼出一炉优质钢，创造了去年大跃进以来的新纪录。上钢三厂青年炼钢能手韩忻亮小组创造四点零七分炼一炉铸件钢的新纪录后，立即被老将孙万银的小组以三点五十七分打破。
