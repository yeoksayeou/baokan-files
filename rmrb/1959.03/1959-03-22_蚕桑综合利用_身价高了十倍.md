Comprehensive utilization of sericulture resources in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, only began in June 1958. In the past six months, more than 30 factories have successfully trial-produced and put into production nine categories and 32 types of products. By the end of the year, the output value, according to incomplete statistics, has exceeded 3 million yuan. This figure is equivalent to 40% of the total output value of 75,000 dan of silkworm cocoons in the county last year, accounting for 5% of the total output value of agricultural and sideline products in the county.

The products that have been successfully trial-produced and put into production can be divided into nine categories:

    I. Using the mulberry bark from pruned mulberry branches to make rayon, which is white and soft. Now, the Chengguan Rayon Textile Factory has been using rayon made from mulberry bark to produce large quantities of cotton quilt batting and knit winter socks and work gloves. Recently, the factory has also woven various fine cloths such as serge, twill, and plain weave.

    II. Using mulberry bark to make paper pulp, which is better than paper pulp made from other raw materials. The Xinshi Paper Mill has now produced more than 1,000 tons of mulberry bark pulp.

    III. Using mulberry juice to make wine. The wines made include: sweet and delicious mulberry liqueur, 60-proof spirits, and alcohol.

    IV. Using pruned mulberry stalks to replace bamboo or rattan to weave various light and beautiful utensils.

    V. Using silkworm excrement to make activated carbon. The quality is better than activated carbon made from wood chips and rice husks. At the same time, about 5% of mixed oil can be extracted from silkworm excrement when making activated carbon.

    VI. Using silkworm pupae to refine pupae oil. Pupae oil can be used as a lubricant in industry, can be used for lighting, and can also replace part of tallow to make soap.

    VII. Using the defatted pupae after extracting pupae oil to extract protein, nutrients, and valuable western medicine tyrosine.

    VIII. Using pupae shells to make shellac (shellac is a sizing agent for fabrics).

    IX. Using cocoon filaments to make artificial wool, sericin, and serine.

Recently, the Chengguan Rayon Textile Factory has also successfully trial-produced a substitute for casein - protein - by extracting it from withered mulberry leaves, and has used wastewater from rayon production from mulberry bark to extract mulberry pectin for sizing silk.

The full utilization of sericulture resources has broken through the old rules of mulberry leaf silkworm rearing and silkworm cocoon silk reeling in Deqing County in the past, and expanded the scope of sericulture production. Practice in the past six months has proved that there are three main benefits of doing so:

    I. Turning waste into "treasure." Through comprehensive utilization, useless things are turned into useful things, one use is turned into multiple uses, and low-value things are turned into high-value things. For example, mulberry branches used to be burned as firewood. Now, the mulberry bark is peeled off to make rayon, spun into yarn and woven into cloth; silkworm pupae used to be used as fertilizer. Now, they are used to refine pupae oil and extract four or five kinds of valuable medicines; cocoon filaments used to be used as raw materials for low-grade silk spinning and were of very low value. Now, they are used to extract serine, and the value has increased dozens of times. In this way, the output value of silk reeling only accounts for one-fifteenth of the total output value of the comprehensive utilization of the same amount of silkworm cocoons. According to the current situation in Deqing County, the total output value of one mu of mulberry land producing a thousand catties of leaves and a hundred catties of cocoons can be increased tenfold compared with the original value of cocoon production after comprehensive utilization.

    II. Opening up broad avenues for vigorously developing local industries. According to the existing level of sericulture production and silk reeling in our county, the mulberry bark, mulberry stalks, silkworm excrement, mulberry fruit, silkworm pupae, and cocoon filaments provided throughout the year can be used to run thousands of factories.

    III. It can further promote the development of sericulture production. Comprehensive utilization of sericulture resources greatly increases the income of the masses and encourages the enthusiasm of the masses for developing sericulture production. The development of sericulture production, in turn, replenishes the resources for comprehensive utilization, and the two promote each other.

    蚕桑综合利用　身价高了十倍
    浙江德清县对蚕桑资源的综合利用是从1958年6月份才开始的。半年来先后已经有三十多个工厂试制成功并已投入生产的产品有九类三十二种，到年底的产值据不完全的统计已经超过了三百万元。这个数字相当于去年全县蚕茧七万五千多担总产值的40％，占全县农副业总产值的5％。
    已经试制成功并已投入生产的产品可分为九类：
    一、利用刈下的桑枝上的桑皮制人造棉，质地洁白柔软。现在已由城关人造纺织厂利用桑皮人造棉大量制作棉被胎，针织成冬袜和工作手套，最近还由这个厂织成哔叽、斜纹、平纹等各种细布。
    二、利用桑皮制纸浆，比其他原料制的纸浆好，现在已由新市造纸厂生产桑皮纸浆一千多吨。
    三、利用桑果汁制酒。制做的酒有：香甜可口的桑果露酒、六十度烧酒和酒精。
    四、利用刈下的桑杆代替毛竹或白藤编制各种轻巧美观的用具。
    五、利用蚕粪制活性炭。质量要比木屑、砻糠做的活性炭好，蚕粪制活性炭的同时还可以提取5％左右的混合油。
    六、利用蚕蛹提炼蛹油。蛹油可以作为工业上的滑润剂，可以点灯，也可以代替一部分牛油制肥皂。
    七、利用提取蛹油后的脱脂蛹提取蛋白素、营养素和贵重西药酪氨酸。
    八、利用蛹壳制壳糖（壳糖是织物上的浆剂）。
    九、利用茧衣制人造羊毛、丝胶和丝氨酸。
    最近又由城关人造棉纺织厂试制成功用枯桑叶提取干酪素的代用品——蛋白素和利用桑皮制人造棉后的废水提取浆丝用的桑皮果胶。
    蚕桑资源的充分利用，冲破了德清县过去的桑叶养蚕，蚕茧缫丝的陈规，扩大了蚕桑生产的范围。半年来的实践证明，这样做总的好处有三点：
    一、把废物变成了“财宝”。经过综合利用，把无用变为有用，把一用变为多用，把价值低的变为价值高的。如桑枝条，过去只当柴烧，现在桑皮剥下来制人造棉，纺纱织布；蚕蛹过去只作肥料，现在用来炼蛹油和提取四、五种贵重药品；茧衣过去只作低级绢纺原料，价值很低，现在用来提取丝氨酸，价值提高了几十倍。这样一来，缫丝的产值只占同数量蚕茧综合利用总产值的十五分之一。根据德清县现在情况来看，一亩亩产千斤叶、百斤茧的桑地，经综合利用后总产值可比原来产茧价值增加十倍。
    二、为大办地方工业开辟广阔道路。根据我县现有蚕桑生产和缫丝的水平计算，全年提供的桑皮、桑杆、蚕粪、桑果、蚕蛹、茧衣等，就可以办上千个工厂。
    三、可以进一步促进蚕桑生产的发展。综合利用蚕桑资源，就大大地增加了群众的收入，鼓舞了群众对发展蚕桑生产的积极性，蚕桑生产的发展反过来又充实了综合利用的资源，两者相互促进。　（中共德清县委会）
