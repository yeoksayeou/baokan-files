    Let People Eat More Coffee
    (Our dispatch) Yunnan Province is taking shape as a new base for coffee production in our country. At present, more than 40,000 mu of coffee trees have been planted throughout the province, and most coffee plantations have already blossomed and produced beans.
    These coffee plantations are distributed in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and Lincang Special District on the southwest and southern borders of Yunnan. In these areas, there are large areas of river valley plains and hills below 1,500 meters above sea level, belonging to tropical and subtropical climates, with fertile soil, abundant rainfall, and a calm wind environment, which are suitable for coffee growth. The germination rate of seedlings in various places reaches 80% to 90%, and the survival rate after planting is generally 85%, with the highest reaching 100%. Coffee seedlings grow very well after planting, and generally bloom and produce beans in the second year after planting. The yield is also very high. The two-year-old coffee trees in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Tropical Crop Experimental Farm produce an average of 0.34 jin of dry beans per tree. The four-year-old young trees in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Tropical Crop Experimental Farm produce an average of 0.686 jin of dry beans per tree, with the highest producing 9.4 jin of dry beans per tree. As for the yield of old coffee trees, it is even higher. A Dai farmer in Shunha Village, Ruili County, had a 14-year-old coffee tree that produced 20 jin of dry beans in 1957. A 17-year-old coffee tree planted by a Dai farmer in Huwa Village, Ruili County, produced 14 jin of dry beans in 1957.
    Minority nationalities in the border areas of Yunnan have been planting coffee for more than 40 years. As early as 1914, Dai farmers in Ruili County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, began to grow coffee. In 1927, minority nationalities in Hekou County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, also planted coffee. Now, in some Dai villages in Ruili County and Luxi County, there are still many old coffee trees that are more than 20 years old, but in the past, minority people only planted them sporadically in front of and behind their houses or in gardens next to their houses. By the time of liberation, there were only about 5,000 coffee trees in Dehong area, the main coffee producing area, and the output was extremely small. Yunnan's relatively large-scale coffee planting began in 1956. The state has successively established 31 state-owned farms and three tropical crop experimental farms in the border areas to cultivate coffee and carry out experimental research work. The Party Committee and People's Government of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture also vigorously helped and supported Dai farmers in planting coffee. Of the more than 40,000 mu of coffee plantations that have been planted, about half are cultivated by the masses. In the autonomous prefecture alone, 40,000 jin of dried coffee was produced in 1958.

    让人们吃到更多的咖啡
    本报讯　云南省正在形成为我国生产咖啡的新基地。现在，全省已经定植咖啡树四万多亩，大多数咖啡园已经开花结豆。
    这些咖啡园分布在云南西南和南部边疆上的德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州和临沧专区等地。在这些地区内，有大片海拔一千五百公尺以下的河谷平原和丘陵，属于热带和亚热带气候，土壤肥沃，雨量丰富，又是静风环境，适宜咖啡生长，各地育苗的出芽率达到80％至90％，定植成活率一般是85％，最高的达到100％。咖啡苗种下后生长很好，一般定植后第二年即开花结豆。产量也很高，西双版纳傣族自治州热带作物试验场的两年生咖啡树，平均每树结干豆零点三四市斤，德宏傣族景颇族自治州热带作物试验场的四年生幼树，平均每株产干豆零点六八六市斤，最高的每株产干豆九点四市斤。至于老咖啡树的产量就更高，瑞丽县顺哈寨的傣族农民有一株十四岁的老咖啡树，1957年产了干豆二十市斤，该县户瓦寨傣族农民种的一株十七岁的老咖啡树，1957年产了干豆十四市斤。
    云南边疆的少数民族栽种咖啡已有四十多年历史，早在1914年，德宏傣族景颇族自治州瑞丽县的傣族农民即开始种植咖啡。1927年，红河哈尼族彝族自治州河口县的少数民族也种了咖啡。现在，瑞丽县和潞西县的若干傣族村寨中，还有不少二十年以上的老咖啡树，但过去少数民族人民只零星地种植在房前屋后或宅旁花园中，到解放时，主要咖啡产地德宏地区一共只有五千株左右咖啡树，产量极微。云南比较大面积的种植咖啡是从1956年开始的，国家先后在边疆建立了三十一个国营农场和三个热带作物试验场，栽培咖啡和进行试验研究工作。德宏傣族景颇族自治州的党委和人民政府也大力帮助和扶持傣族农民种植咖啡。目前已定植的四万多亩咖啡园，约有一半是群众栽培的。仅自治州一地，1958年即生产了干咖啡四万市斤。（附图片）
