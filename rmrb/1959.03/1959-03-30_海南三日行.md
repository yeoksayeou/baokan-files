Three Days in Hainan
    Zhu Guang
	
    Flying across the Hainan Sea by iron bird,
    The Five Fingers Mountain is charming and unconventional.
    A thousand miles of waves sing praises to the flourishing days,
    With the harmony of man and nature, what more could one ask for?

    Yulin Overlook
    The waves in Yulin are calm and blue,
    The sea is wide and the sky vast, allowing freedom.
    May I ask the seagulls if they know happiness?
    The east wind carries me on a boat.

    A Night at Luhuitou
    Having hunted Luhuitou to the end of the earth,
    Achieving a good relationship with the deer has fulfilled my aspirations.
    Tonight, the sea roars for ten thousand miles!
    Drinking coconut milk as wine, I listen to the tide and sing.

    海南三日行
    朱光
    琼海上空浪跨铁鸟海南游，五指骄娆不俗流，千里波涛歌盛日，人天一色有何求。
    榆林远眺榆林浪静碧油油，海阔天空任自由，借问群鸥知乐否？东风携我也飞舟。
    夜宿鹿回头天涯猎尽鹿回头，获鹿良缘志已酬。此夜海涛腾万里！椰浆作酒听潮讴。
