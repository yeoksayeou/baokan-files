    A Strange Question

    Ten years ago, in a poor mountain village in Xuanhan County, Sichuan, there was a poor child who hadn't even finished elementary school, spending his days working in the fields with his grandfather. One day, while hoeing weeds in the cornfield, the child suddenly asked his grandfather a strange question: "Grandpa, why do corn leaves always grow to the sides? Why don't they grow in all directions?" His grandfather couldn't answer him. That child was Zhang Mingde, the Party Secretary of the Shangxia People's Commune, who created the corn directional seeder and reformed cultivation techniques to make corn leaves grow in the direction people specify, thereby increasing the density of planting and turning low yields into high yields.

    Zhang Mingde was originally the Deputy District Head of Nanba District in Xuanhan County. Although he grew up in the countryside, he initially didn't particularly like rural work, feeling it was mundane and didn't offer much opportunity. In 1956, the organization sent him to Party school. Through studying Party history and dialectical materialism, and reviewing his work over the past few years, he gradually realized that his past feeling of monotony in rural work was mainly due to a lack of deep engagement with the masses and a lack of the spirit of sharing weal and woe with them. At the same time, he deeply understood that a Communist Party member is not only a vanguard fighter in the class struggle but also shoulders the great mission of transforming nature, transforming the world, and liberating all of humanity. From then on, he changed his view of rural work, determined to live in the countryside for a long time, immerse himself in the heat of the struggle, and serve the people wholeheartedly. In early 1957, at his urgent request, he was transferred from the district to the Shangxia People's Commune to serve as the Party Secretary.

    Inspired by an Old Man's Words

    Shangxia Township is located at an altitude of 700 to 1700 meters, surrounded by undulating mountains, with rugged terrain, many slopes, and thin soil. When Zhang Mingde arrived here, his first impression was that this was a poor and barren mountainous area in urgent need of transformation.

    To understand the natural conditions of this mountainous area and the production and living conditions of the farmers, he visited every corner of the township as soon as he arrived, conducted interviews in every household, invited farmers to meetings, and lived and worked alongside the commune members. After more than a month of investigation, he gradually formed the view that although the farmers in the mountainous area had made great achievements in the years since liberation under the correct leadership and meticulous care of the Party, the old production habits of slash-and-burn agriculture and extensive cultivation with low yields had not been completely changed due to the limitations of natural conditions. Grain yields were not high, and the living standards of the farmers were still very low. Once, he visited a farmer named Liang Yousong in the high mountains and found that this family's life was still very difficult. Liang Yousong, who was in his sixties, asked with a tone full of hope, "Secretary Zhang, when will the lives of us in the mountains catch up with those in the plains!" These words struck Zhang Mingde like a nail, making him feel uneasy for a long time. From this, he deeply felt the weight of his responsibility and further strengthened his determination to settle in the mountainous area and dedicate all his strength to completely changing the backwardness of the mountainous area.

    At a Party committee meeting, Zhang Mingde reported on the materials he had gathered from his investigations and put forward his opinions on how to solve the problem of the farmers' livelihood in the mountainous area. The Party committee discussed the matter, and there were initially three different opinions: the first opinion was that the farmers in the mountainous area had low incomes and difficult lives, and advocated government relief; the second opinion was that the natural conditions in the mountains were poor and it was difficult to develop production, and advocated relocating the farmers from the mountains; the third opinion, which Zhang Mingde actively advocated, was that to thoroughly improve the lives of the farmers in the mountainous area, it was necessary to further mobilize the farmers and develop production in accordance with the characteristics of the mountainous area and in a way that was appropriate to local conditions. After repeated debates, a consensus was finally reached, and it was decided to take the third opinion as the basic principle for solving the problem of the livelihood of the mountainous area, and a seven-year plan for developing production in the mountainous area was formulated based on this principle. As a result, corn, which accounted for nearly half of the total grain output of the commune, was given an important position in vigorous development.

    Moving to Yangliuguan Mountain

    Although this commune produced corn, its yields had always been very low in the past. Before liberation, the yield was only a few tens of jin per mu. In 1956, the average yield per mu was only a little over one hundred jin. In order to find a way to increase corn production, Zhang Mingde personally moved to Yangliuguan Mountain, which is 1,500 meters above sea level, to set up a point. Through on-site labor and careful observation, he found that the general practice here was: to get the corn to grow big, the distance between each seedling should be one hoe handle. Some land was not even dug; people simply hoed a pit in the ground, scattered some ash fertilizer, and sowed the seeds. The main reason for the low corn yield was this kind of shallow cultivation, rough work, and extensive, sparse planting. He and Wu Xizhi, the former Deputy Director of the agricultural cooperative, studied the matter and decided to change this backward farming habit and adopt the method of staggered, dense planting for experimentation. They reduced the original spacing of about four feet between seedlings to one foot and two inches, and reduced the row spacing to one foot and five inches. In this way, the number of plants per mu increased from the original 1,400 to 4,500. This approach was initially opposed by many people, who said, "To get the corn to grow, the leaves must not touch each other; to get the corn big, the leaves must not fight each other. Planting so densely, what kind of harvest will there be!" An old farmer named Yu, in order to oppose their "risky" approach, planted a plot of "sparse, large seedlings" on the side of the experimental field, carefully managing it to compete with the densely planted corn in terms of yield. At harvest time, many farmers came to see who would win this competition. The results of the inspection showed that the plot of land planted by old man Yu yielded 800 jin per mu, while the experimental plot yielded 1,067 jin per mu. At this point, the farmers of the whole commune were convinced: dense planting can indeed increase production. Old man Yu said, "Secretary Zhang is really a clever man. I've been farming for decades and I'm still not as good as him!" From then on, the Party's prestige was established in the mountainous area, and people deeply realized that all of the Party's policies and measures were for the benefit of the broad masses of the people. They had a special love and trust for the Party!

    However, through this experiment, Zhang Mingde discovered a very important problem, which was what many experienced farmers said: to get the corn to grow, the leaves must not touch each other; to get the corn big, the leaves must not fight each other. This is because the growth of plants requires water and nutrients internally, and air and sunlight externally. If it is too dense, it will affect the ventilation and light transmission of the plants, and it will also be difficult to manage. The experimental plot that he and Wu Xizhi worked on failed to achieve the planned yield of 2,000 jin per mu precisely because of this. If the density of planting is to be further increased, it is necessary to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission accordingly.

    Like Soldiers Standing in Formation

    How can one achieve both high-density planting and good ventilation and light transmission for plants? For a long time, Zhang Mingde had been thinking about this problem over and over again. Last spring, seeing that the corn planting season was approaching, the pressure of the situation forced him to spend more time considering this issue. He took some corn kernels to experiment with, arranging them back and forth on the dining table, but the results were either too dense or unable to increase the number of seedlings, and ventilation and light transmission always seemed to conflict with expanding density. One arrangement could solve this contradiction, which was to shorten the distance between seedlings and widen the row spacing, so that the corn leaves would all grow between the rows. But who had ever seen such a thing? It wasn't in the books. Scientists said they hadn't studied it. When he asked the old farmers, they all said, "I've been farming all my life, and I've never seen corn leaves all grow between the rows!" During these days, he really racked his brains, thinking and thinking, and never stopped studying this problem even while eating and sleeping. One night, he was lying in bed, recalling the scene of planting the experimental field on Yangliuguan Mountain a few days ago, recalling the past when he planted corn with his grandfather as a child, and suddenly remembered something:

    "Grandpa, look, the corn leaves always grow to both sides, they don't grow randomly in all directions..." Could it be that corn leaves grow according to this pattern? That's right, what he observed on Yangliuguan Mountain was exactly like that. Then, in which direction does the corn tiller? Only by first understanding this pattern can the problem of directional leaves be solved.

    The next morning, contrary to his usual practice of using a loud song to replace the wake-up call, he got up quietly and carefully, picked up an oil basket lid in the corner of the room, mixed cattle manure, baking soda powder, kiln ash, and river sand, which could increase the temperature, together, put them in the lid, and then divided the soil into four grids. He planted the corn in the four soil grids in four different forms: "straight row, horizontal placement; straight row, upside-down placement; upside-down row, vertical placement; random row, random placement," using the greenhouse seedling method for experimentation. Three days later, the corn sprouted, but before he had time to study its tillering pattern, it was stolen and eaten by those hateful mice. He was not discouraged and started the second experiment. As luck would have it, someone who didn't know better poured a ladle of boiling water on the oil basket lid, which damaged the seeds. Two consecutive failures gradually made him feel somewhat disappointed. However, thinking of developing production in the mountainous area, thinking of the urgent demands of all the farmers in the commune to expand corn dense planting, he strengthened himself and continued the third experiment. This time, after planting the seeds, he held them in the sunlight during the day and in the kitchen at night, covering them with a large lid, taking even more careful care. A few days later, the corn seedlings grew to more than three inches tall, and he gathered some experienced farmers to study its tillering growth pattern together. The corn seedlings in one of the grids all grew to both sides after emerging from the soil, arranged very neatly, like soldiers standing in formation. Digging up the soil in this grid, it was found that the corn seeds were all placed horizontally in a straight row, and each grain tillered from the horizontal side, growing opposite each other. Finally, he mastered the pattern of tillering growth of corn.

    The Birth of the Directional Seeder

    Through on-site introductions and field visits, the method of directional cultivation of corn was quickly promoted throughout the commune. People changed the habit of random sowing and planting and planted corn in the form of "straight row, horizontal placement," with a seedling spacing of three to four inches and a row spacing of about three feet, increasing the density of planting from the original 1,000-plus seedlings per mu to more than 7,000, greatly increasing the density of planting. However, after this method was promoted for only a few days, the commune members began to complain: "Directional cultivation is good, but it takes too much work!" It turned out that in order to achieve "straight row, horizontal placement," each seed had to be planted manually, and one person could only sow two or three fen of land a day, which was too inefficient. The emergence of this new problem caused Zhang Mingde to start thinking again: wouldn't it be great if a "directional seeder" could be used to replace manual sowing! He and Hu Jiantang, an old worker at the farm implement repair shop, studied and tried to make one together, but they failed several times in a row. However, he still strengthened his belief in victory. Every time he failed, he learned a lesson and made an improvement. After repeatedly modifying it more than 30 times, he finally created the directional seeder. This seeder is extremely simple. When sowing, just put the selected seeds inside, push it forward gently, and the seeds will automatically set the direction and distance in a very regular way according to the "straight row, horizontal placement" format, sowing to the position where they should be sown. The efficiency is five to six times higher than manual placement, and it can also ensure the quality of the sowing specifications and reduce physical labor. The commune members praised: "The directional seeder is simple and clever, and it operates like a running horse, everyone likes it!"

    In early autumn, the corn in Shangxia Commune ripened. The commune members celebrated this year's great harvest with drums and gongs. On Yangliuguan Mountain, which is 1,500 meters above sea level, all 140 mu of corn land adopted directional cultivation, and the average yield per mu increased from 136 jin in 1957 to 1,029 jin, an increase of 6.5 times. Among them, an experimental plot cultivated by Deputy Director Wu Xizhi, Production Team Leader Liu Huiwan, and commune members Li Mingyu and Liu Wenhua yielded an average of more than 2,175 jin per mu, creating a miracle of large-scale corn harvest in the high mountain area.

    The creation of the corn directional seeder greatly encouraged the people in the mountainous area to transform nature and change from poor to rich, and inspired people's infinite wisdom. Subsequently, people also carried out many major technical reforms in wheat, rice, and other aspects, and created new types of agricultural tools and implements that were adapted to the characteristics of the mountainous area, such as well-drilling machines and compression water pumps, which greatly improved labor efficiency. This year, the commune members have also put forward the bold slogan of guaranteeing a yield of 10,000 jin of corn per mu, determined to make an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of 1958!

    叫玉米叶按照指定方向生长
    四川日报记者　张学愚
    奇怪的问题
    十年前，在四川宣汉县的一个穷山沟里，有一个连小学也没有念完的苦孩子，成年累月地跟他爷爷在田里地里劳动。不知怎的，有一次在锄包谷草的时候，这孩子忽然向爷爷提出了一个奇怪的问题：“爷爷，你看这包谷叶子老是向两边长，为甚么不四面八方地生长呢？”他爷爷怎么也回答不上来。这个孩子，就是创造玉米定向播种器，改革栽培技术　要玉米叶子按人们指定的方向生长，从而增加密植程度，变低产为高产的上峡人民公社党委书记张明德。
    张明德原来是宣汉县南坝区的副区长。他虽然从小生长在农村，但最初对农村工作并不怎么喜欢，总觉得平平淡淡，没有什么出息。1956年，组织上送他进了党校。通过党史和辩证唯物主义学习，回顾几年来的工作，使他渐渐察觉到，过去对农村工作感到平淡，主要是没有深入群众，缺乏与群众同甘共苦的思想感情。同时他还深深体会到一个共产党员，不仅是阶级斗争的先锋战士，而且还担负改造自然，改造世界，解放全人类的伟大使命。从此，他改变了对农村工作的看法，决心长期生活在农村，深入到火热的斗争中去，全心全意地为人民服务。1957年初，在他的迫切要求下，便由区下放到上峡人民公社，担任了党委书记。
    老人的话引起的
    上峡乡拔海七百至一千七百公尺，周围山峦起伏，地势崎岖，坡多田少，土层瘦瘠。张明德来到这里以后，第一个感觉就是：这是个贫苦瘦瘠，亟待改造的山区。
    为了了解这山区的自然面貌和农民的生产生活状况，他一来就跑遍了全乡的每一个角落，深入到每家每户进行访问，邀请农民座谈，并和社员们一起生活，一起劳动。经过一个多月的调查，在他思想上逐渐形成了这样一种看法：解放几年来，山区农民在党的正确领导和无微不至的关怀下，虽然做出了很大的成绩，但由于自然条件的限制，过去那种刀耕火种、广种薄收的生产习惯并没有完全改变，粮食产量不高，农民的生活水平也还很低。有一次，他在高山上访问了一家名叫梁友松的农民，发现这家人生活还很苦。六十多岁的梁友松带着一种充满期望的口吻问道：“张书记，我们山上的生活要什么时候才能赶上平坝地区啊！”这句话像钉子一样钉在张明德的心上，使他长久感到不安。由此，他深深感到自己责任的重大，更加坚定了在山区落户的思想，决心献出自己一切力量，彻底改变山区的落后面貌。
    在一次党委会上，张明德把自己调查所获的材料作了汇报，并提出了如何解决山区农民出路问题的意见。党委会进行了讨论，开始有三种不同的意见：第一种意见认为，山区农民收入少，生活困难，主张政府救济；第二种意见认为，山上自然条件差，很难发展生产，主张把山上的农民迁下山来；第三种意见，就是张明德积极主张的，要彻底改善山区农民生活，只有把农民进一步发动起来，根据山区的特点，因地制宜地发展生产。经过反复地争辩，最后统一了认识，决定以第三种意见为解决山区出路问题的基本方针，并根据这一方针制定了发展山区生产的七年规划。于是，占全社粮食总产量近半数的玉米，便被提到了大力发展的重要地位。
    搬上杨柳关山
    这个社虽然生产玉米，但过去的产量一直很低。解放前亩产只有几十斤。1956年的平均亩产也不过一百多斤。为了摸索一条玉米增产的门路，张明德亲自搬到拔海一千五百公尺的杨柳关山上驻点。通过实地劳动和仔细观察，发现这里的一般习惯是：要得玉米结得大，每窝距离一锄把。有些土地，甚至连土也不挖，只是在地里锄个窝窝，撒把灰粪就播种了。玉米产量不高，主要就是由于这种浅耕粗作、广种稀植所致。他和原来的农业社副主任吴希志进行了研究，决定改变这种落后的耕作习惯，采用错窝密植的方法进行试验。他们把原来四尺左右的窝距缩短一尺二寸，把行距缩短到一尺五寸，这样，每亩种植株数就由原来一千四百窝增加到四千五百窝。这种作法，开始遭到了许多人反对，说：“要得包谷结，不准叶挨叶；要得包谷大，不准叶打架。种这样密，有什么收成啊！”有一个姓余的老农民，为了反对他们这种“冒险”的作法，就在试验地的侧边种了一块“稀大窝”，细心经营，要和这块密植玉米较量一下产量。收获的时候，很多的农民都来了，看看这场比赛谁胜谁负。验收结果：余老汉种的一块地亩产八百斤，那块试验地亩产了一千零六十七斤。这时，全社的农民都信服了：密植硬是能够增产。余老汉说：“张书记硬是个聪明人，我做了几十年庄稼还不如他啦！”从此，党在山区的威信树立起来了，人们深深体会到党的一切政策措施都是为广大群众的利益，对党特别热爱，特别信赖！
    但是，通过这次试验，张明德却发现了一个非常重要的问题，就是许多有经验的农民说的：要得包谷结，不准叶挨叶；要得包谷大，不准叶打架。因为植物的生长，内部需要水份和养料，外部则需要空气和阳光，密了，就会影响植物通风透光，而且不易管理。他和吴希志搞的这块试验地，正是因为这样，而没有达到亩产二千斤的预定计划。如果再要增加密植程度，就必须要相应地解决通风透光问题。
    像士兵站纵队一样
    怎样才能做到既要高度密植，又要让植物通风透光呢？很长一个时期以来，张明德都在这个问题上反来复去地思考着。去年春天，眼看玉米播种季节就要到了，形势的逼迫，不得不使他拿出更多的时间来考虑这个问题。他拿了些玉米做实验，在饭桌上摆来摆去，结果不是太密，就是不能增加窝数，通风透光和扩大密度总是矛盾着的。有一个摆法到可解决这个矛盾，就是把窝距缩短，行距放宽，要玉米叶子一律向行间生长。但谁又见过这样的事情呢？书本上没有。科学工作者也说没有研究过。请教老农民，都说：种了一辈子庄稼，从来都没有见过玉米叶子一律向行间生长啊！这些日子，他真是绞尽脑汁，左思右想，连吃饭睡觉都没有停止过对这个问题的研究。一天夜里，他睡在床上翻来复去地回忆着前些日子在杨柳关山上种试验地的情景，回忆着童年时代和爷爷一起种玉米的往事，忽地想起了一桩事情：
  “爷爷，你看包谷叶子老是向两边分长，不四面八方乱长……”难道玉米叶子就是按照这个规律生长么？对，在杨柳关观察的情况也正是这样。那末玉米又是向那个方向分蘖呢？只有首先弄清这个规律，叶子定向问题才能得到解决。
    第二天清早，他一反以往用高亢的歌声代替起床号的常规，轻脚轻手地起来，在屋角头拾了个油篓子盖盖，用能增加温度的牛粪、小苏打粉、火窑灰和河沙混在一起，装在盖子里面，再将泥土分成四个格子，把玉米按“顺排横放、顺排倒放、倒排立放、乱排乱放”四种不同形式，分别下种在四个泥土格子里面，用温室育苗的方法进行试验。三天以后，玉米吐出了嫩芽，但还没有来得及研究它的分蘖规律，就被讨厌的老鼠偷食光了。他没有灰心，接着又开始了第二次试验。事情真凑巧，不知是那个不懂事的舀了一瓢滚水放在油篓盖子上，把种子烫坏了。接连两次的失败，渐渐使他有些感到失望。但是，一想到发展山区生产，想到全社农民对于扩大玉米密植的迫切要求，他又坚强起来，继续进行第三次试验。这次，他把种子播好后，白天端在阳光下面，晚上又端在灶房里，用个大盖子盖着，护理更是仔细了。几天之后，玉米芽子又长出了三寸多高，他把一些有经验的农民找来，共同研究它的分蘖生长规律。有一个格子里的玉米芽子，出土后一律都顺着两边对长，像士兵站纵队一样，排列得非常整齐。挖开这个格子的泥土，发现玉米种子一律是顺排横放着，每一粒都是从横面分蘖，对面生长，终于掌握了玉米分蘖生长的规律。
    定向播种器诞生了
    经过现场会的介绍和实地参观，玉米定向培植的方法便很快在全社范围内推广开了。人们改变了乱播乱植的习惯，把玉米按“顺排横放”的形式进行种植，窝距三至四寸，行距三尺左右，使每亩由原来一千多窝密植到七千多窝，大大增加了密植程度。可是，这个方法才推行了几天，社员们就嚷开了：“定向培植好到好，就是费工太多哟！”原来，为了做到“顺排横放”，每一粒种子都要用人工种下去，一个人一天只能播二三分地，工作效率太低。这一新问题的出现，又使张明德开动了脑筋：要是用“定向播种器”来代替人工播种多好啊！他和农具修配厂的老工人胡建堂一起研究，一起试制，接连好几次都失败了。但他仍然坚定了必胜的信心，失败一次，便吸取了一次教训，进行一次改进，这样反复地修改了三十多次，终于把定向播种器创造成功了。这个播种器极其简便，播种时，只要把经过选择的种子放在里面，向前轻轻推动，种子就很有规律地按“顺排横放”的形式，自动定好方向和距离，播到应播的位置上去。效率比人工安放提高了五至六倍，又能保证播种的规格质量，减轻体力劳动。社员们赞扬道：“定向播种器，简便又伶俐，操作如跑马，人人喜欢它！”
    初秋，上峡公社的玉米成熟了。社员们敲锣打鼓地庆贺这一年的巨大丰收。在拔海一千五百公尺的杨柳关山上，一百四十亩玉米地全部采用了定向培植，平均亩产由1957年一百三十六斤提高到一千零二十九斤，产量增加六点五倍。其中由副社长吴希志、生产组长刘辉万、社员李明玉、刘文华等四人培植的一块试验地，平均亩产达二千一百七十五斤多，创造了高山地区玉米大面积丰收的奇迹。
    玉米定向播种器的创造，大大鼓舞了山区人民改造自然、由穷变富的信心，启发了人们无穷的智慧。接着，人们又在小麦、水稻等方面进行了许多重大的技术改革，创造了探井器、压缩抽水机等适应山区特点的新式农具工具，大大提高了劳动效率。今年，社员们又提出了保证亩产万斤玉米的豪迈口号，决心在1958年的基础上，来一个更大更好更全面的跃进！　　　　（原载四川日报）（附图片）
