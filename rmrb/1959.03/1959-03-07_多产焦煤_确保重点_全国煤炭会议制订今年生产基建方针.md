Produce More Coking Coal, Ensure Key Priorities
National Coal Conference Formulates This Year's Production and Construction Guidelines

    This newspaper reports that the National Coal Industry Cadre Conference concluded on March 3rd. The cadres participating in this conference, based on summarizing the achievements and rich experiences of the great leap forward in the national coal industry last year, believe that it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the production of 380 million tons of coal this year, and have made specific arrangements. The conference lasted for six days.
    The conference first summarized the achievements and experiences of the national coal industry last year. The conference believes that completing the production task of 380 million tons of coal this year is of great significance for ensuring the task of producing 18 million tons of steel this year and the leap forward of the entire national economy. To this end, first, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game." Implementing the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game" in coal industry production and construction means focusing on ensuring the production task of 380 million tons of coal in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources; among them, the production and construction of coking coal and coal washing are the priorities, and the production and construction work of the coal industry is comprehensively arranged. The specific arrangement principles are: when production and construction conflict, give priority to production; when the production and construction of coking coal and general coal conflict, give priority to coking coal; when key areas and general areas conflict, give priority to key areas. Therefore, in terms of capital construction, it is necessary to implement a prioritized and urgent queueing system, shorten the front, seize the key points, concentrate manpower and material resources, carry out successive assaults, complete one batch, and then build another batch. This year, the need for the production and construction of the main coking coal base must be guaranteed first.
    Second, vigorously launch mass movements, carry out technical revolution, and carry out a large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition movement centered on increasing the output of coal mining faces. Each mine must achieve "high yield on every face, high yield every month." The conference emphasized using normal production methods such as completing plans on a daily and ten-day basis and maintaining a certain proportion between coal mining and tunneling, and using the promotion of advanced experience and methods that conform to economic accounting to achieve the goal of large-scale bumper harvests. The conference believes that to achieve large-scale bumper harvests, it is necessary to vigorously launch mass movements and carry out technical revolution.
    Third, in order to complete the task of 380 million tons of coal this year, the conference believes that the working methods of leading business in the form of mass movements last year, this combat spirit-possessing work method, as well as a series of mass line leadership methods such as cadres participating in labor, planting "experimental fields," and holding on-the-spot meetings in a timely manner, should continue to be promoted this year. The experience summarized by various enterprises of "if you don't understand, debate; if you don't believe, look; if you don't know how, learn; if you learn, do" in leading mass movements should be well applied by leaders at all levels.

    多产焦煤　确保重点
    全国煤炭会议制订今年生产基建方针
    本报讯　全国煤炭工业干部会议已在3月3日闭幕。参加这次会议的干部在总结去年全国煤炭工业大跃进的成就和丰富经验的基础上，认为今年完成和超额完成三亿八千万吨煤是完全可能的，并且作了具体安排，会议共开了六天。
    会议首先总结了去年全国煤炭工业的成就和经验。会议认为，今年完成三亿八千万吨煤的生产任务，对于确保今年生产一千八百万吨钢的任务和整个国民经济的跃进，具有重要的意义。为此，第一，必须坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针。煤炭工业生产建设中贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，就是在人力、物力、财力上以确保三亿八千万吨煤炭的生产任务为重点；其中又以焦煤和洗煤的生产建设为重点，全面安排煤炭工业的生产建设工作。具体安排的原则是：当生产与建设发生矛盾时服从生产；焦煤与一般煤的生产建设发生矛盾时服从焦煤，重点区与一般地区发生矛盾时服从重点区。因此，在基本建设方面，要实行重重急急排队，缩短战线，抓住重点，集中人力、物力，分批突击，建成一批，再建一批。今年首先是保证主焦煤基地生产建设的需要。
    第二，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，开展以提高采煤工作面的产量为中心的大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动。每个矿井都要达到“面面高产，月月高产”。会议强调用按日按旬完成计划，保持采煤同掘进一定比例等正常的生产方法，用推广先进经验符合经济核算的方法来达到大面积丰产的目的。会议认为，要大面积丰产，就必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。
    第三，为了完成今年三亿八千万吨煤的任务，会议认为去年用群众运动的形式领导业务，这种具有战斗精神的工作方法，以及干部参加劳动、种“试验田”、及时召开现场会等一系列的群众路线的领导方法，今年应继续发扬。各企业总结的“不通就辩，不信就看；不会就学，学会就干”这一领导群众运动的经验，各级领导干部应当很好的运用。
