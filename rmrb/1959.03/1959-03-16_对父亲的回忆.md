    Recollections of My Father
    —In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of A.S. Popov's Birth
    Ya. Popova, Director of the Popov Memorial Museum at the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute
    I was only seven years old when my father passed away. However, I still clearly remember his image: tall, broad-shouldered, with bright brown eyes, a kind smile always on his face, amiable and approachable, and very simple in his personal life.
    My father devoted himself wholeheartedly to scientific work, yet he had a great interest in painting, often visiting museums and art exhibitions; he also loved music and frequently went to the opera.
    Alexander Stepanovich loved his motherland. Once, he received a letter from a foreign company inviting him to work and reside abroad. However, money and the generous treatment promised by the company could not move my father's heart, and he sternly rejected the invitation. He wanted to complete the cause that had become the purpose of his life on the land of his motherland.
    My father's life was one of diligent and tireless labor. Even on his way home from work, he would continue his experiments. At home, our living room gradually became his radio transmitting and receiving station.
    Due to financial constraints, my father could not take long periods of rest. During the months he was not teaching at the Kronshtadt Mine Officer Training Class and the Naval Engineering School, he also served as the head of the Nizhny Novgorod Municipal Market Power Station.
    After inventing the radio, A. Popov worked for many years to equip warships with this invention. He was extremely dissatisfied with the results of this work, because the Tsarist government did not give due attention to this important invention, nor did it create the conditions to equip the Russian Navy with radio equipment. Of course, my father was very saddened that his invention could not be used to serve his motherland.
    On September 26, 1905, the Electrotechnical Institute held its first election meeting to elect a principal. Popov, a famous scholar and social activist who actively fought for the autonomy of higher education and against the interference of Tsarist officials in school affairs, was elected as the principal.
    In 1905, students of the Electrotechnical Institute openly challenged the autocratic system by hanging a red flag with the words "Long Live the Democratic Republic." Governor-General Trepov, known for suppressing revolutions, reported this incident in a report to the Minister of Internal Affairs. The Minister of Internal Affairs wrote the following comment on the report: "Summon the principal of the school and ask him how he explains this incident."
    The red flag remained hanging until it was taken down in the evening. Police guarded the entrance to the student dormitories. Searches and arrests began. Some students escaped from the back doors of our and other professors' residences. My father supported the students' just actions.
    The police searches, the news of student arrests, and the repeated summons from the governor-general and the mayor all severely damaged Alexander Stepanovich's health. On January 13, 1906, A. Popov died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of forty-seven.
    A. Popov's sudden death aroused strong reactions among Russian social figures. Disregarding the surveillance of the censorship authorities, people delivered speeches at the inventor's tomb and memorial services, and wrote commemorative articles in newspapers, pointing out that Popov's death was caused by the brutal persecution of the reactionary authorities.
    The Popov Memorial Museum established at the Ulyanov Electrotechnical Institute in Leningrad can be said to be a monument built for this great Russian scientist. The museum reflects the main periods of his life and activities through a large amount of material. On display here are the scientist's manuscripts, notebooks, photographs, patent certificates, and other relics. The museum introduces in detail the history of Popov's invention of the radio. Here, it can be clearly seen that the predictions and ideals of Popov, the founder of radio, have become a reality, and the Soviet Union's achievements in radio have long surpassed his most daring ideals.

    对父亲的回忆
    ——纪念亚·斯·波波夫100年的诞辰
    列宁格勒电工学院波波夫纪念馆主任  亚·波波娃
    我父亲逝世的时候，我才七岁。然而我现在仍然清楚地记得他的形象：高身材、宽肩膀，有一双明亮的褐色眼睛，脸上总是挂着慈祥的微笑，为人和蔼可亲，自处十分简朴。
    我的父亲全心尽意致力于科学工作，然而他对绘画有极大的兴趣，经常参观博物馆和美术展览会；他又爱好音乐，经常去听歌剧。
    亚历山大·斯捷潘诺维奇热爱祖国。有一次，他接到一家外国公司给他来的一封信，这信邀请他到国外去工作和居住。然而金钱和公司允诺的优厚待遇并不能打动父亲的心，他严词拒绝了这一邀请。他要在祖国的土地上完成已成为自己生活的目的的事业。
    父亲的一生是勤恳和不知疲倦的劳动的一生。就是在下班回家的道路上，他也要继续进行自己的试验。在家里，我们的客厅逐渐地就成了他的无线电收发报站。
    由于生活的不充裕，父亲不能做较长时间的休息。在喀琅施塔得水雷军官讲习班和海军工程学校任教的空闲月份，他就兼任著名的尼日涅戈罗德市定期市场发电站的站长。
    发明了无线电后，亚·波波夫为了用这种发明装备军舰工作了许多年。他对于这一工作的结果极不满意，因为沙皇政府对这一重要发明没有给予应有的重视，也没有创造用无线电设备装备俄国海军的条件。当然，我的父亲对于自己的发明未能被利用来为祖国服务，是感到十分痛心的。
    1905年9月26日电工学院举行了第一次选举校长的选举大会。著名的学者、为争取高等学校的自治权，反对沙皇官吏干涉学校事务进行积极斗争的社会活动家波波夫当选为校长。
    1905年，电工学院学生们向专制制度发出了公开的挑战，挂出了写着“民主共和国万岁”字样的红旗。以摧残革命著称的总督特列波夫在写给内政部大臣的报告中报告了这次事件。内政部大臣在报告上写下了这样的批语：“传讯该校校长，问他怎样解释这次事件。”
    这面红旗一直悬挂到晚上才被取下。在学生宿舍入口处有警察守卫。搜查和逮捕开始了。一部分学生从我们以及其他教授住宅的后门逃跑出去。父亲是支持学生们的正义行动的。
    警察局的搜查，学生被捕的消息，总督和市长的屡次传唤，所有这一切都严重地损害了亚历山大·斯捷潘诺维奇的健康。1906年1月13日，亚·波波夫因脑溢血逝世了，这时他才四十七岁。
    亚·波波夫的突然逝世，在俄国社会人士中间引起强烈的反应。人们不顾检查机关的监视，在发明家的墓前和追悼会上发表演说，在报章上写纪念文章，指出波波夫的死是反动当局残酷迫害造成的。
    设立在列宁格勒乌里扬诺夫电工学院的波波夫纪念馆可以说是为这位伟大俄国科学家建立的纪念碑。纪念馆通过大量的资料反映了他的生平和活动的主要时期。这里陈列着科学家的手稿、笔记本、照片、发明专利特许证和其他遗物。纪念馆祥细地介绍了波波夫发明无线电的历史。在这里可以清楚地看到，无线电的创始人波波夫的预言和理想已经变成现实，苏联在无线电方面的成就早已远远超过了他最有胆略的理想了。（附图片）
