Several High-Yielding Rice Varieties with Large Ears and Many Grains

    Early Japonica No. 16 has long ears and many grains, averaging 80 to 100 grains per ear, with some reaching 120 to 180 grains. The thousand-grain weight is 24 to 27 grams, and the brown rice rate is 79.02%. The rice grains are transparent and of good quality. Its stems are thick and strong, the leaves are dark green, it is tolerant to fertilizer, and it is not prone to lodging. Its tillering and regeneration abilities are strong, but it is susceptible to rice blast. Trial planting in several provinces in South and Central China last year yielded good results.
    Guihuaqiu is an early and mid-season Japonica rice variety selected and bred by the Chuxian Prefecture Farm in Anhui. Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have begun to promote it, and Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi are also actively introducing it for expanded trial planting. Its characteristics are: small abdominal white, good rice quality, short and strong stalks, tolerance to waterlogging, drought resistance, particularly strong fertilizer tolerance, borer avoidance, and resistance to disease and wind.
    Beilu No. 12 was selected and bred by the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute. In 1957, it participated in the national joint regional trial and ranked second in yield in Jingzhou and first in yield in Enshi.
    This variety has many grains, tight grain setting, good rice quality, thick and short stalks, and is generally not prone to lodging. The seedlings are cold-resistant, have strong tillering ability, and a high effective tillering rate. It does not shed grains, but is susceptible to rice blast.
    Beilu No. 12 has strong adaptability. In Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces, it is a very good double-cropping early Japonica rice variety. In Hubei, it can be cultivated as early and mid-season rice.
    Dali Early is a double-cropping early rice farmer variety from Echeng County, Hubei. It began to be promoted in Xiaogan and Jingzhou prefectures, Hubei, in 1956. By 1958, more than 300,000 mu had been planted throughout the province. Dali Early has thick and strong stalks, tall plants, green leaves, and strong resistance to rice blast, but it is not tolerant to fertilizer and is prone to lodging and grain shedding.
    South China No. 13 is a new early rice variety bred by the South China Agricultural Science Research Institute. Regional and production trials have been carried out in enclosed fields and terraced fields in Foshan, Huiyang, Gaoyao, Zhanjiang, and other prefectures in Guangdong since 1954, and good results have been obtained. Planted at the Wengyuan County Farm, it yielded 50% more than the local farmer variety "Tianshangluo."
    This variety generally has 120 to 150 grains per ear, with some reaching 250 grains. It is fertilizer-tolerant, not prone to lodging, has thick stalks, few unfilled grains, stable yield, and wide adaptability.
    Huadong 399 is a new variety bred by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute through hybridization. Its female parent is "Victory Xian" and its male parent is "Zhongnong No. 4." It has the characteristics of not easily shedding grains, being tolerant to fertilizer, having uniform heading, strong resistance to leaf rice blast, and moderate resistance to panicle neck rice blast.

    几个穗大粒多的水稻良种
    早粳16号穗长，籽粒多，平均每穗八十至一百粒，多的达一百二十至一百八十粒，千粒重二十四至二十七克，糙米率79.02％，米粒透明，质好。它的茎秆粗壮，叶色浓绿，耐肥，不易倒伏，分蘖力和再生力均较强，但较易感染稻热病。去年在华南、华中几省试种，效果均好。
    桂花球安徽滁县专区农场选育出来的早中粳稻品种，安徽、江苏两省已开始推广，湖南、广东、广西也积极引种扩大试种。它的特点是：腹白小，米质好，秆矮粗壮，耐涝，耐旱，耐肥力特强，避螟，抗病和抗风。
    北陆12号华中农业科学研究所选育出来的，1957年参加全国联合区域试验，在荆州产量居第二位，在恩施产量占第一位。
    这种品种粒多，着粒紧密，米质好，茎秆粗矮，一般不易倒伏，苗期耐寒，分蘖力强，有效分蘖率很高，不落粒，但易感染稻热病。
    北陆12号适应性强，在江西、广东等省是一个很好的双季早粳稻品种，在湖北可作早中稻栽培。
    大粒早湖北鄂城县双季早稻农家品种，1956年开始在湖北孝感、荆州专区推广，1958年全省已种植三十多万亩。大粒早茎秆粗壮，植株高大，叶色绿，抗稻热病力很强，但不耐肥，较易倒伏和落粒。
    华南13号华南农业科学研究所新育成的一个早稻品种，1954年起在广东佛山、惠阳、高要、湛江等专区的围田、垌田进行区域试验及生产试验，均获得良好的结果。在翁源县农场种植，比当地农家种“天上落”增产五成。
    这个品种一般每穗一百二十到一百五十粒，高的二百五十粒，耐肥，不易倒伏，茎秆粗大，不实粒少，产量稳定，适应性较广。
    华东399华东农业科学研究所杂交选育而成的新品种。其母本为“胜利籼”，父本为“中农4号”，具有不易落粒，能耐肥，出穗整齐，抗叶稻瘟病力强，抗穗颈稻瘟病能力中等。
