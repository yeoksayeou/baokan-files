Changsha, March 3rd (reporting): Chenjiaqiao People's Commune in Xinshao County, Hunan Province, has formulated a production Great Leap Forward plan for 1959, determining that the total output of grain crops this year will be 2,000 jin per mu (compared to 800 jin per mu in 1958), and is actively expanding diversified operations, planting cotton, flax, oil, sugar, and other items urgently needed by the state.

When formulating this year's production plan, some cadres and commune members of the commune simply pursued cash income and advocated reducing the area of paddy fields. In response to these ideas, the commune's Party committee launched a great airing of views, great debate, and big-character posters among cadres and the masses on the topics of "Should the People's Commune Produce According to the National Plan?", "Should Grain Production Be the Main Focus?", and "Which Commodities Should Be Developed?". During the debate, by calculating accounts (accounts of national needs, accounts of commune needs, accounts of commune economic development, and accounts of increasing income for commune members) and presenting facts, everyone established a global perspective of obeying the national plan and realized that the economy of the People's Commune is a component of the entire national economic plan. Only by treating the whole country as "one chessboard" and incorporating the commune's production into the national plan can the commune's economy develop by leaps and bounds. Xu Meixuan, a commune member of the Wansui Temple Brigade, said: "The planned targets assigned to each commune by the state are like a screw on a complete machine, and not a single one can be missing." Through debate, everyone's understanding was unified, and they unanimously expressed that they must obey the overall national plan and develop the production of the People's Commune in a planned and proportional manner.

On the basis of unified ideological understanding, after extensive discussions by all commune cadres and members, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, a grand plan for the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture for the entire commune this year was formulated. In order to solve the contradiction of developing economic crops without competing for land with rice, the main measures taken are to move economic crops to the mountains and utilize dry land. In terms of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and forestry, the plan also determines that there should be corresponding development in 1959. After the plan is realized, the total output value of the entire commune this year will reach more than 11 million yuan, averaging more than 420 yuan per person.

In order to bring the commune's plan into the orbit of the national plan, so that the commune's production and commodity exchange can be carried out more correctly under the guidance of the national unified plan, the commune's management committee has signed purchase and sales combination contracts with relevant departments such as commerce and grain. The contract stipulates that in 1959, the entire commune will sell more than 8 million jin of grain (including requisition and sales), 300,000 jin of peanuts, 1.75 million jin of sugar, and 200,000 jin of tobacco to the state, as well as ginger, live pigs, tung oil, ramie, etc.

On the basis of relying entirely on unified sales in the past, cotton will achieve basic self-sufficiency; oil crops also relied on state unified sales in the past, but this year, in addition to achieving self-sufficiency, there will also be a slight surplus for sale. Specific provisions have also been made in the contract regarding the portion of the supplies needed by the commune from the state.

Kunming, March 3rd (reporting): Dengchuan County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has re-formulated this year's production leap forward plan in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and the actual conditions within the county.

When the Dengchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China initially formulated this year's production plan, considering last year's bumper harvest and the fact that the county's grain was more than self-sufficient, it was decided to reduce more than 30,000 mu from the more than 70,000 mu of paddy fields, freeing up land to develop sugarcane, sugar beets, and potato crops. Later, with the help of the Dali Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Dengchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of various communes carefully studied the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and gradually realized that rice is one of the main staple foods of the people throughout the country, and grain production is a unified arrangement for the whole country. The completion of the national and provincial unified economic plans depends on the efforts of various localities and departments. Therefore, the smaller picture must obey the larger picture. If the larger picture is not done well, the smaller picture cannot be done well either; if the larger picture is victorious, the problems of the smaller picture will be easily solved. During the study, the County Party Committee also realized that it was inappropriate to cut the rice area in half, starting only from Dengchuan County. The development of sugarcane and sugar beets cannot adopt the method of reducing rice acreage. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, this year's production plan was re-formulated: the rice area was doubled, and the average yield per unit area was required to be doubled compared to last year; the cotton planting area was expanded by more than ten times compared to last year; and the area of sugarcane and sugar beets was reduced.

After the plan was changed, the Dengchuan County Committee and the Party committees of various communes discussed and made proper arrangements on how to first concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources on major production aspects, and conducted an ideological education on "the whole country as one chessboard" for cadres throughout the county. The labor force used in agricultural production throughout the county has increased from 40% in the past to 65%. (Attached picture)

    按照国家需要修订计划
    陈家桥公社多种国家急需的经济作物
    邓川县积极扩大粮食和棉花播种面积
    本报长沙3日电　湖南省新邵县陈家桥人民公社，制订了1959年生产大跃进规划，确定今年粮食作物的总产量为亩产二千斤（1958年亩产八百斤），并积极扩大多种经营，多种国家急需的棉、麻、油、糖等。
    这个公社在制订今年生产规划的时候，有部分干部和社员单纯追求现金收入，主张缩减稻田面积。针对这些思想，公社党委以“人民公社要不要按照国家计划进行生产”、“应不应该以生产粮食为主”和“发展哪些商品生产”为题，在干部、群众中开展了大鸣大放大辩论。辩论中，通过算账（国家需要账、公社需要账、公社经济发展账、社员增加收入账）、摆事实，使人人树立了服从国家计划的全局观点，认识到人民公社的经济是整个国民经济计划的组成部分，只有“全国一盘棋”，把公社的生产纳入国家计划，才能促使公社经济飞跃发展。万岁庙大队社员徐梅轩说：“国家分配给每个公社的计划指标，好比整套机器上的一个螺丝钉，一个也少不得。”通过辩论，统一了大家的认识，一致表示一定要服从国家整体计划，有计划、按比例地发展人民公社的生产。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，经过全体社干部和社员的广泛讨论，从上而下，从下而上地订出了全社今年工农业全面大跃进的宏伟规划。为了解决发展经济作物不与水稻争地的矛盾，主要是采取经济作物上山、利用旱土的办法。在畜牧水产和林业方面，规划确定1959年也要有相应的发展。这个规划实现后，全社今年总产值将达一千一百多万元，平均每人四百二十多元。
    为了使公社的计划纳入国家计划的轨道，使公社的生产和商品交换能更正确地在国家统一计划的指导下进行，该社管理委员会已经和商业、粮食等有关部门签订了购销结合合同。合同规定，1959年全社将卖给国家粮食八百余万斤（包括征购和出售）、花生三十万斤、糖一百七十五万斤、烟叶二十万斤，其他还有生姜、生猪、桐油、苎麻、等。
    棉花在往年全靠统销的基础上，作到基本自给；油料过去也是靠国家统销，今年除做到自给外，还略有卖出。关于公社需要国家供应的部分，合同中也作了具体规定。

    本报昆明3日电　云南省大理白族自治州邓川县根据“全国一盘棋”的精神和县内的实际情况，重新制订今年的生产跃进规划。
    中共邓川县委在最初制订今年的生产计划时，考虑到去年丰收，全县的粮食已自给有余，决定把七万多亩水稻减少三万多亩，腾出地来发展甘蔗、甜菜和洋芋类作物。后来，中共邓川县委和各公社党委在中共大理地委的帮助下，仔细学习了八届六中全会的决议，逐渐地认识到大米是全国人民的主要食粮之一，粮食生产是全国统一安排的。全国、全省统一经济计划的完成，有赖于各个地方和各个部门的努力。因此，小局要服从大局。大局搞不好，小局也不可能搞好；大局胜利了，小局的问题也就容易解决了。学习中，县委还认识到过去只从邓川一个县出发，把水稻面积削减了一半是不妥当的。甘蔗、甜菜的发展不能采用减少稻谷面积的办法。于是根据省委、地委指示，重新制订了今年的生产计划：水稻面积增加了一倍，平均单位面积产量要求比去年翻一倍；棉花的播种面积比去年扩大十倍以上；甘蔗、甜菜的面积减少了。
    计划改变以后，邓川县委和各公社党委就如何首先集中使用人力、物力、财力于主要生产方面的问题进行了讨论和妥善的安排，并对全县干部进行了一次“全国一盘棋”的思想教育。全县用在农业生产上的劳动力由过去的40％增加到65％。（附图片）
