Alum, also known as white alum or raw alum, is a white, transparent, block-shaped crystal (it has various colors when it contains impurities), tastes astringent and slightly sweet, easily dissolves in water, and has astringent and precipitation effects. Alum has a wide range of uses. It can clarify muddy water and is a clarifying agent for water plants and edible river water. In the papermaking industry, it is used as a filler, which can make wrapping paper moisture-proof and cultural paper resistant to feathering. In medicine and hygiene, it is used to stop bleeding, sterilize and preserve. When it is in ink, it can increase the adhesion of the ink, making it difficult to erase when printed on paper. In addition, it is also needed in the leather making, glass, rubber, printing and dyeing, pigment, sulfuric acid, photographic plate, and food industries.

Alum is a natural mineral, and China has a large reserve of it. The counties of Pingyang in Zhejiang Province, Lujiang in Anhui Province, and Urumqi and Kuqa in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have already been mined and produced. Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hunan, Hebei and other provinces also have alum mines. (Attached picture)

    明矾
    明矾，也叫白矾或生矾，是一种白色透明块状的结晶体（含杂质时才有种种颜色），味涩稍甜，容易溶于水，有收敛和沉淀作用。明矾的用途很广，可使混水澄清，是自来水厂和食用江水的清水剂；在造纸工业上用作填料，可使包装纸具有防潮性，使文化纸具有抗阴力；在医药卫生上用来止血、杀菌防腐；油墨里有它时，可增加油墨附着力，印在纸上不容易擦掉。另外，在制革、玻璃、橡胶、印染、颜料、硫酸、照像胶板、食品等工业上也都需要它。
    明矾是一种天然矿产，我国蕴藏量很大，现已开采生产的有浙江省平阳县、安徽省庐江县、新疆维吾尔自治区的乌鲁木齐和库车。四川、云南、山东、山西、湖南、河北等省也都有明矾矿。（附图片）
