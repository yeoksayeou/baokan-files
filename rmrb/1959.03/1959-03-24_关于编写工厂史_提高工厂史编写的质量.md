    On Writing Factory History
    Improving the Quality of Factory History Writing
    Wang Wei
    Reading the "Factory History" in "Frontier Literature" gave me a profound class education. Worker Shi Wenliang said, "I often compare my personal experiences in the old and new societies, because the contrast makes it clearer whether something is red or black, good or bad. The comparison makes me love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even more. My enthusiasm for work also increases!" He spoke about the role of "Factory History" in factories and mines in promoting production by combining it with the central task. He spoke about the educational significance of "Factory History" for worker comrades, especially young workers. But I think its educational significance is not limited to this. Even those who have not personally participated in this struggle are greatly educated and inspired after reading "Factory History," thus moving forward to communism more courageously! The educational significance of "Factory History" is for the whole people.
    The "Factory History" published in "Frontier Literature" are all told or written by workers. Although they are mostly fragments of life memories or a short story, they express the strong ideological feelings of the working class because they are the personal experiences of the narrators, which makes them very intimate and exciting. It allows people to see a historical outline of the workers' struggle in our province (Yunnan Province). We can see how the industry in our province, under the leadership of the Party, grew from small to large, and how socialist industry was built on a barren foundation; it specifically shows the great collectivist thought and the spirit of continuous revolution shown by the working class in their labor.
    However, compared with the actual situation of the workers' struggle in various factories and mines in our province, and according to the requirements of the development of the revolutionary history of various factories and mines, the existing "Factory History" is insufficient in both quantity and quality.
    The Chinese working class grew up in extremely cruel class struggles. To truly reflect the historical development of the struggle, we must write about the lives and struggles of worker comrades in many ways and in depth. We must outline the social background at that time in many ways. For example, at that time, the reactionary ruling class not only enslaved and exploited workers materially and physically, but also carried out brutal suppression ideologically, spiritually, and culturally. … Our factory history should expand the scope of reflecting life, expose and鞭挞this barbaric society from different aspects, so that people can fundamentally recognize and hate the system of exploitation!
    To achieve this, "Factory History" should not only reflect one person's life experiences, let alone only see things but not people. We should write about the comparison between the working class and the hostile classes, and we should show the trend of the struggle at that time. Of course, these must be embodied through specific people and events, so we should pay attention to the description of characters in "Factory History." In particular, we should focus on describing those advanced workers who stood at the forefront of the struggle, as well as those martyrs who gave their lives for the great cause of the working class. Because they specifically embody the obvious class characteristics, and their thoughts and actions embody the noble qualities of the working class.
    The description of the enemy should not be simplified either. In essence, capitalists, landlords, secret agents, or warlords are all people who are obsessed with profit and exploitation, and are animals whose souls have rotted. However, in the society at that time, they had different faces: there were ferocious thugs, as well as cunning smiling tigers. There were greedy gluttons, as well as sinister hypocrites. If we can truthfully reveal all of this, it will make people further appreciate the cruelty and complexity of class struggle.
    Our "Factory History" writing work must more widely mobilize the masses and more carefully excavate historical materials. In the brewing stage, in addition to paying attention to the beginning and end of the event, the narrator is also required to recall the activities of positive and negative characters, the atmosphere of the environment at that time, and other relevant details. When recording, the recorder is required not only to achieve the truth of the basic plot, but also to record those vivid descriptions of the characters, and to try to record the narrator's vocabulary, and never replace it with their own language.
    When writing "Factory History," attention should be paid to its continuity. We believe that each factory and mine should first divide the stages according to the historical development process of its own factory and mine, and refer to the archives or relevant materials mastered by the "Factory History" writing team, sort out the clues, find the most important events in each stage, and formulate a writing plan. Then, around the main events, convene all the workers or relevant staff and family members who participated in the event to hold a forum for recalling and recording. The "Factory History" that has been sorted out or published can still be used as material for processing.
    A complete "Factory History," in addition to writing about the struggles in history, must also describe the development of factories and mines in the past few years after liberation, and also write about the revolutionary spirit and communist spirit of the working class in the Great Leap Forward. It is said that the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant is preparing to compile a revolutionary hero genealogy in "Factory History." We believe that this practice is worthy of promotion in various factories and mines.

    关于编写工厂史
    提高工厂史编写的质量
    王伟
    读了“边疆文艺”上的“工厂史”，使我受到了极为深刻的阶级教育。工人施文良说：“我常把新旧社会的亲身经历拿来对比，因为一对比，是红是黑，是好是歹就更加分明，一对比就更加热爱共产党和毛主席。干活的劲头也就更大了！”他说出了“工厂史”在厂矿中结合中心任务，推动生产的作用。说出了“工厂史”对工人同志们，特别是青年工人的教育意义。但是我认为它的教育意义还不仅于此，即使没有亲身参加过这种斗争的人，读了“工厂史”后，也受到了很大的教育和鼓舞，从而更勇敢地向共产主义前进！“工厂史”的教育意义是全民性的。
    “边疆文艺”所发表的“工厂史”，都是工人讲述或写成的。虽然多是些片断生活的回忆或一个简短的故事，但由于都是讲述者的切身经历，文章中表现了强烈的工人阶级的思想感情，读来感到十分亲切，激动人心。使人从中形象地看到了我省（云南省）工人斗争的一个历史轮廓。可以看到我省的工业如何在党的领导下，由小到大，如何在一个荒芜的基础上，建成了社会主义的工业；具体显示了工人阶级在劳动中所表现的伟大的集体主义思想和不断革命的精神。
    但是，对照一下我省各厂矿工人斗争的实际情况来看，就各厂矿革命历史的发展来要求，现有的“工厂史”无论在数量和质量上，就显得不够了。
    中国的工人阶级，是在极为残酷的阶级斗争中成长起来的。要真实地反映出斗争历史发展过程，就必须多方面地、深刻地写出工人同志们的生活和斗争。必须多方面地勾画出当时的社会背景。譬如，在当时，反动的统治阶级除了在物质上、肉体上去奴役和剥削工人，在思想上、精神上、文化上也进行了残暴的扼杀。……我们的工厂史，应当扩大反映生活的面，从不同的方面来揭露并鞭挞这个野蛮的社会，从而更使人从本质上认清并仇恨那个剥削人的制度！
    要做到这一点，在“工厂史”中就不能只反映一个人生活上的遭遇，更不能见事不见人。应当写出工人阶级与敌对阶级的对比，要显示出当时斗争的趋势。当然这些都要通过具体的人和事件来体现，所以在“工厂史”中要注意人物的描写。尤其要着重描写那些站在斗争前列的先进的工人们，以及那些为了伟大的阶级事业而付出生命的烈士们。因为在他们身上，具体表现了显明的阶级特性，在他们的思想行动中表现出了工人阶级的高贵品质。
    对敌人的描写，也不要简略。从本质上讲，资本家、地主、特务或军阀都是些利欲熏心、剥削成性的人，是些灵魂上已经腐烂了的动物。但是，在当时的社会里，它们却有着不同的面目：既有狰狞的暴徒，也有老奸巨滑的笑面虎。既有贪婪的饕餮者，也有阴恶的假慈悲。假如，我们能如实地揭露出这一切，会使人们更进一步体会到阶级斗争的残酷性和复杂性。
    我们“工厂史”的编写工作，必须更广泛的发动群众，更细致的发掘史料。在酝酿阶段中除了注意事件的始末外，也要求讲述者去回忆正、反面人物的活动，当时的环境气氛及其他的有关的细节等。在记录时，要求记录者不只做到基本情节的真实，而且要记下那些对人物的生动描绘，要尽量记录下讲述者的语汇，千万不要以自己的语言去代替。
    在编写“工厂史”时，应当注意到它的连贯性。我们认为，事先各个厂矿应根据自己厂矿的历史发展过程，并参考“工厂史”编写小组所掌握的档案或有关资料，分出阶段，理出线索，找出每一阶段中最主要的事件，订出编写计划。然后围绕着主要事件，再去召集所有参加这一事件的工人或有关的职员、家属开座谈会，进行回忆、记录。已经整理或发表了的“工厂史”，仍可做为素材进行加工。
    一部完整的“工厂史”，除了写出了历史上的斗争而外，还必须要描写解放后几年来厂矿的发展，也要写出工人阶级在大跃进中所表现的敢想敢干的革命气概和共产主义精神。据说，昆明钢铁厂准备在“工厂史”中，编写革命英雄谱。我们认为，这种作法是值得在各厂矿中推广的。
