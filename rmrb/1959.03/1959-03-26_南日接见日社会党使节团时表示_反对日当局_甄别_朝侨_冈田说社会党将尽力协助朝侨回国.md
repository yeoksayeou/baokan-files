Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 25th. North Korean Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il met with the Japanese Socialist Party delegation headed by Soji Okada on the 24th.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, Nam Il pointed out during the meeting with the delegation that the Korean people will under no circumstances tolerate the "screening" of Korean residents in Japan who wish to return to their homeland, or the "confirmation" of their will. He said that after the Japanese authorities decided to repatriate Korean residents in Japan, they artificially complicated the issue, and this inappropriate practice violates humanitarianism and international conventions.

Nam Il welcomed the delegation's visit to North Korea and expressed satisfaction with the recent efforts of the Japanese Socialist Party to normalize relations between the people of North Korea and Japan, and to promote the resolution of the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning home. Nam Il expressed welcome to the Japanese Socialist Party's opposition to the Japanese authorities' delaying the resolution of the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning home.

Soji Okada said that we have made efforts in the past and are making efforts now to strive for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, but due to the inappropriate practices of the Japanese government, the first ship carrying Korean residents in Japan back home has not yet sailed. He said that the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning home should be resolved based on humanitarian principles. He expressed full support for the Korean people's struggle against the Japanese authorities' attempt to "screen" Korean residents in Japan and "confirm" their will.

The delegation stated that in order to develop friendly relations between the people of North Korea and Japan, and to promote the early realization of the wishes of Korean residents in Japan to return home, the Japanese Socialist Party will conduct active activities among the Japanese people and in the Diet.

    南日接见日社会党使节团时表示
    反对日当局“甄别”朝侨
    冈田说社会党将尽力协助朝侨回国
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜内阁副首相兼外务相南日24日接见了以冈田宗司为首的日本社会党访朝使节团。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，南日在接见使节团时指出，朝鲜人民在任何情况下也不能容许对要求回到自己祖国的旅日朝鲜侨民进行“甄别”，或对他们的意志加以“确认”。他说，日本当局决定遣送旅日朝鲜侨民回国以后，又人为地把问题复杂化，这种不当的作法违反人道主义和国际惯例。
    南日对使节团的访问朝鲜表示欢迎，并对日本社会党最近为朝日两国人民间关系的正常化，为促进解决旅日朝侨回国问题所作的努力表示满意。南日表示欢迎日本社会党反对日本当局拖延解决旅日朝侨回国问题的立场。
    冈田宗司说，我们为了争取旅日朝鲜侨民遣送回国，过去和现在都作出努力，但由于日本政府的不当作法，载运旅日朝侨回国的第一只船还没有开出。他说，旅日朝侨归国问题应根据人道主义的原则加以解决。他对朝鲜人民反对日本当局要对旅日朝鲜侨民进行“甄别”和对他们的意志加以“确认”的斗争表示全面的支持。
    使节团表示，为了发展朝鲜日本两国人民间的友好关系，为了促使旅日朝鲜侨民的归国愿望早日实现，日本社会党将在日本人民和国会中进行积极的活动。
