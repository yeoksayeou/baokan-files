Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Initial Rolling Mill Proposes Thousands of Measures to Ensure the Completion of the State Plan
Yangpu Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory Calculates Detailed Accounts and Exploits Potential to Raise Production Targets to Advanced Levels

This newspaper reports Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Initial Rolling Mill has been conducting a vigorous mass movement centered on discussing the 1959 state plan since February 13. During the discussion of the state plan, the workers spoke out freely, everyone offered suggestions and plans, and carried out a technical revolution in a big way. In the first two days of starting the discussion of the state plan alone, they proposed 3,631 measures.

This year, the No. 1 Initial Rolling Mill's discussion of the state plan was fully launched after conscientiously studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, affirming the great achievements of 1958, and identifying experiences and lessons learned. Before discussing the state plan, the factory's Party committee conducted repeated and conscientious research, requesting that through the discussion of the state plan, the enthusiasm of the masses be further boosted, the technical revolution be deepened, and the current great leap forward in production be promoted. The slogan put forward by the Party committee was: "Take production as the center, boost morale, grasp ideology, and firmly grasp measures." Mobilize the masses to formulate measures to ensure the completion of this year's Great Leap Forward plan with ten-point indicators, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point enthusiasm, and strive to realize "one factory becoming two factories" in April.

The discussion of the plan quickly formed a vigorous mass movement. In the process of discussing the state plan, the factory's workers implemented the policy of "summarizing, popularizing, inspecting, improving, discussing, and realizing simultaneously," and used this as the content of the competition, launching a six-comparison competition throughout the factory, summarizing every day, and evaluating every day. When good experiences were discovered, they were promptly and vigorously promoted, forming a production upsurge centered on discussing the state plan throughout the factory. For example, the steel soaking method of Li Changqing's group in the No. 4 soaking furnace, which correctly controlled the air volume and strengthened the close cooperation between the furnace chief and the assistant, was summarized and promoted. Within three days, the steel heating time of thirty-eight furnaces doubled. Another example is Hu Shenglu, the charging machine operator, who summarized the experience of fast furnace charging in 1958, developed and improved it, and created an advanced record of charging eight steel ingots in five minutes. The discussion of the state plan greatly promoted production. Since the soaking section discussed the state plan, the defective products of steel heating have decreased by 35.5% compared with the previous period. The refined steel billets have increased by an average of 70% per day compared with the previous period.

In the process of discussing the state plan, the masses put forward a large number of measures to ensure the completion of the plan. In the first two days of starting the discussion alone, the masses put forward 3,631 measures, of which 1,138 have now been solved and realized by the masses themselves. Brainstorming to propose measures and implement measures has become a matter of common concern for all factory workers. In order to improve the processing capacity of steel billets and ensure that steel billets can be supplied in a timely manner according to the needs of the downstream factories, the workers in the finishing section changed the method of stacking steel billets, separating medium-sized billets and small-sized billets. The steel rolling section reduced the rolling passes of silicon steel from fifteen in the past to thirteen, shortening the rolling time of each steel ingot.

The factory currently has insufficient supply of steel ingots and gas, but in accordance with the spirit of the factory Party committee's instructions, the workers actively create conditions and give full play to their subjective initiative, determined to prepare all the conditions for "one factory becoming two factories" before the end of April, to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's steel billet production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 5th. The workers of Yangpu Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, under the slogan of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, tapping potential, and calculating detailed accounts," discussed and formulated this year's Great Leap Forward plan. According to preliminary calculations, this year's total output value will increase by another 35% on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, labor productivity will increase by another 23%, and the whole year will increase the production of nearly 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn for the country.

Before mobilizing all factory workers to discuss and formulate this year's Great Leap Forward plan, the factory's Party committee adopted the method of using the abstract to lead the concrete and discussing the abstract based on the concrete, mobilizing the masses to calculate detailed accounts and tap potential, so that all factory workers could see both the great achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward and understand the weak links and infinite potential of the factory's production, and jointly formulate an advanced plan for this year's greater leap forward. At the same time, the Party committee also called on all factory workers to combine discussion, accounting, planning, and the actual actions of speaking out freely, carrying out technical revolution in a big way, and attacking key production points, so as to quickly form a new production upsurge.

First of all, the members of the Party committee held small-scale symposiums separately to collect the economic indicators of various cotton textile printing and dyeing factories in the city for comparison, analysis, and accounting. The results showed that many indicators of the factory were still far behind the level of advanced factories. Taking the cotton yarn of sixteen kinds of yarn counts produced as an example, only four kinds of unit output can be included in the ranks of the city's advanced, and the unit output, quality, cost and other indicators of the other twelve kinds are still far behind, and there is great potential to be tapped. The Party committee announced the initial accounting results to all cadres and mobilized more than 700 cadres to calculate accounts together. After the Spring Festival, it further convened mass meetings and held exhibitions to publicly announce the accounting results to the factory workers and mobilized all factory workers to calculate detailed accounts. The workers saw that many of their production indicators had not yet reached the level, and immediately sent representatives to fraternal factories to learn from their experience. The whole factory, from top to bottom, compared with the advanced, calculated detailed accounts, and grasped the key points. The more detailed the accounts were calculated, the greater the potential was calculated, and the higher the enthusiasm was calculated. According to the factory's summary, so far, ten detailed accounts have been basically calculated, and the indicators have been improved. For example, for the above-mentioned sixteen kinds of cotton yarn, the unit output has all reached the advanced level in the city, and the output can be increased by 15%. The production efficiency of spindles and looms is only 90% and 89%. If they are all increased to the advanced level of 95%, the cotton yarn can be increased by another 5%, and the cloth can be increased by 6%. In terms of working hour utilization, after improving the workers' operating level, enough manpower can be saved to increase the number of cotton yarn production shifts per week by one shift, so the cotton yarn output can be increased by another 5%. The printing and dyeing workshop vigorously gives play to the characteristics of dark-colored printed cloth and chemical production technical forces, and can vigorously develop new products of printed and dyed cloth and chemical raw materials, increasing the annual output value by one million yuan. The motor vehicle workshop calculated the production potential, and in addition to repair and maintenance tasks, it can also manufacture machine tools by itself, increasing the output value by 400,000 yuan. In addition, huge potential has also been calculated in terms of raw material consumption and attendance rate. After the above comparison, analysis, and calculation, it is completely certain that the national plan can be overfulfilled this year without increasing manpower and equipment, so that the total output value can be increased by another 35% and labor productivity can be increased by another 22%.

After the Spring Festival, various workshops held mass meetings one after another, setting up stages to challenge each other. Various groups also held lane meetings and brainstorming sessions, grasping key points, offering ingenious plans, and attacking fortresses. More than 6,000 big-character posters were posted in a few days, and the production outlook of each workshop was brand new. In order to improve the spindle production efficiency to the level of 95%, the No. 2 spinning workshop organized maintenance, leather roller, and operator workers to form a "reconnaissance team" to eliminate empty spindles. In just three days, all the empty spindles in the entire workshop were completely eliminated, the workshop was full of red flags, the production efficiency has reached more than 97%, and 43.7 pieces of yarn were over-produced in the three days from February 15 to 17. The printing and dyeing workshop successfully trial-produced new varieties such as color-dotted cloth and fireproof cloth, as well as chemical raw materials such as alcohol, caustic soda, and chloroethanol in just a few days. Now the whole factory is still continuing to compare with the advanced, tap potential, and calculate detailed accounts, and various workshops are formulating and revising specific measures to catch up with the city's advanced indicators. The report-good-news team on the Party committee office building is in constant flow, and there are new changes in the production outlook every day.

    把跃进计划交给群众讨论
    鞍钢第一初轧厂提出千百条措施保证完成国家计划
    杨浦纺织印染厂算细账挖潜力生产指标赶上先进水平
    本报讯　鞍钢第一初轧厂从2月13日开展以讨论1959年国家计划为中心的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在讨论国家计划中，职工大鸣大放，人人献策献计，大闹技术革命，仅在开始讨论国家计划的头两天，就提出了各项措施三千六百三十一件。
    第一初轧厂今年讨论国家计划，是在认真学习党的八届六中全会文件、肯定了1958年的伟大成就、并找出经验教训之后全面展开的。这个厂的党委在讨论国家计划之前，做了反复认真的研究，要求通过讨论国家计划，进一步鼓足群众的干劲，深入开展技术革命，推动当前生产大跃进。党委提出的口号是：“以生产为中心，鼓干劲，抓思想，狠狠抓措施。”发动群众以十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲来制定保证完成今年跃进计划的措施，争取4月份实现“一厂变两厂”。
    讨论计划迅速形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。这个厂职工在讨论国家计划过程中，贯彻了“边总结、边推广、边检查、边改进、边讨论、边实现”的方针，并以此为竞赛内容，在全厂开展了六比竞赛，天天总结，天天评比。发现好的经验，及时大张旗鼓地加以推广，在全厂形成了一个以讨论国家计划为中心的生产高潮。例如四号均热炉李长青小组的闷钢方法，正确地控制风量、加强炉长与助手的密切配合协作等先进操作经验，总结推广后，三天内就有三十八炉烧钢时间翻了番。又如装入机手胡胜禄在总结了1958年快速装炉经验后，并加以发展提高，又创出五分钟装八块钢锭的先进纪录。通过讨论国家计划，大大地推动了生产。均热工段自从讨论国家计划以来，烧钢的废品比前一时期下降了35.5％。精整的钢坯每天平均比前一时期增加了70％。
    在讨论国家计划过程中，群众提出了大量的保证完成计划的措施。仅在开始讨论的头两天，群众提出的各项措施就有三千六百三十一件，现在已经由群众自己动手解决而实现的有一千一百三十八件。开动脑筋提措施，实现措施，已经成为全厂职工共同关心的事情。精整工段工人为了提高钢坯处理能力，使钢坯能够根据下厂需要及时供应，改变了钢坯堆垛方法，把中型坯和小型坯分别堆放。轧钢工段减少了矽钢的轧制道次，由过去十五次减少到十三次，缩短了每块钢锭的轧制时间。
    这个厂目前钢锭供应和煤气供应都不够正常，但是职工按照厂党委指示的精神，积极创造条件，充分发挥主观能动性，决心在4月底以前准备好“一厂变两厂”的一切条件，保证完成和超额完成今年钢坯的生产任务。
    本报上海5日电　杨浦棉纺织印染厂职工在“比先进、学先进、挖潜力、算细账”的口号下，讨论和制订今年的跃进规划。据初步计算，今年生产总值将在去年大跃进的基础上再增加35％，劳动生产率再提高23％，全年将为国家增产近三万件棉纱。
    在发动全厂职工讨论和制订今年的跃进规划之前，这个厂的党委采取以虚带实，以实论虚的办法，发动群众算细账，挖潜力，使全厂职工既看到去年大跃进的伟大成就，又摸清本厂生产的薄弱环节和无穷潜力，共同制订出先进的今年更大跃进的规划。同时，党委还号召全厂职工，把讨论、算账、订规划和大鸣大放、大闹技术革命、猛攻生产关键的实际行动结合起来，迅速形成新的生产高潮。
    首先党委委员分头召开小型座谈会，搜集全市各棉纺织印染厂的经济指标加以对比、分析、算账，结果发现本厂不少指标还大大落后于先进厂的水平。以生产的十六种纱支的棉纱为例，只有四种单位产量可以列入全市先进的行列，其他十二种的单位产量、质量、成本等指标还差得很远，大有潜力可挖。党委会就把初步算账结果向全体干部公布，动员七百多干部一齐来算账。春节以后，又进一步召开群众大会和举办展览会，向全厂工人群众公开算账结果，动员全厂职工来算细账。工人们看到自己的生产指标还有不少没有达到水平，立刻派出代表到兄弟厂去学习经验。全厂上下，人人比先进，算细账，抓关键。账愈算愈细，潜力愈算愈大，干劲愈算愈高。据全厂汇总，到目前为止，已基本上算了十笔细账，指标都有了提高。如上述十六种棉纱，单位产量全部达到全市先进水平，产量就可提高15％。纱锭和布机的生产效率只有90％和89％，如都提高到95％的先进水平，则棉纱又可增产5％，布增产6％。工时利用方面，在提高工人操作水平以后，可以节约足够的人力，使每周棉纱生产班次增加一班，由此棉纱产量又可提高5％。印染车间大力发挥深色花布的特色，和化工生产技术力量，可以大搞印染布新产品和化工原料，全年增加产值一百万元。机动车间计算了生产潜力，除修配任务外，还可自造机床，增加产值四十万元。此外，在原材料消耗、出勤率等方面，也都算出了巨大潜力。经过以上对比、分析、算账，今年在不增加人力和设备条件下，完全有把握超额完成国家计划，使生产总值再增加35％， 劳动生产率再提高22％。
    春节后，各车间纷纷召开群众大会，摆擂台相互挑战。各小组也纷纷举行弄堂会、碰头会，抓关键、献妙计、攻堡垒，几天内贴出大字报六千多张，各车间生产面貌一新。二纺车间为了提高纱锭生产效率到95％的水平，组织保全、皮辊、运转工人成立“侦察队”，消灭空锭。仅三天时间，全车间就完全消灭空锭，车间内一片红旗，生产效率已达到97％以上，2月15日到17日的三天内就超计划生产四十三点七件纱。印染车间在短短几天内就试制成功彩点布、防火布等新品种及酒精、烧碱、氯乙醇等化工原料。  现在全厂还在继续比先进、挖潜力、算细账，各个车间都在制订和修改赶上全市先进指标的具体措施。党委会办公楼上报喜队川流不息，生产面貌每天都有新的变化。
