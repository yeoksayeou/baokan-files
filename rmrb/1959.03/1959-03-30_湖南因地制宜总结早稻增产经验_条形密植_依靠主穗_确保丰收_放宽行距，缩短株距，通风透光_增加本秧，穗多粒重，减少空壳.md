Changsha, March 29th (This newspaper) -- How to resolve the contradiction between dense planting of early rice and growing conditions such as ventilation and sunlight? How to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice with more spikes, more grains, and heavier grains? Before the early rice transplanting, various parts of Hunan mobilized the masses to summarize their experience of high-yield dense planting from last year, and found effective methods for increasing production such as strip close planting, increasing main stalks, and relying on main spikes. In order to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of more than 18 million mu of early rice in the province this year, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made special arrangements to universally promote this reasonable dense planting method for increasing production during early rice transplanting. Based on the current conditions of deep plowing, heavy fertilization, and improved cultivation techniques in the province, the Provincial Committee requires all localities to adapt to local conditions. Generally, each rice plant should be transplanted with eight to ten main stalks, and each mu should be planted with 30,000 to 40,000 or 40,000 to 50,000 plants, generally with about 300,000 main stalks per mu being appropriate. All localities have implemented this new production increase measure by starting from their own local conditions, mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, and summarizing last year's bumper harvest experiences, in accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Committee's instructions. At present, early rice has been sown in most parts of the province, with 20 to 25 jin of seed rice sown per mu, laying a good foundation for promoting this new production increase measure this year.

Last year, the transplanting methods used throughout the province were diverse. There were squares, rectangles, and strips. According to the results of recent comparative summaries from various localities, strip close planting with wider row spacing and narrower plant spacing generally resulted in significant yield increases. Last year's early rice comparison experiment in the Hongwen Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in You County showed that square close planting with 3x3 inch spacing produced an average of 937 jin per mu, while strip close planting with 2x6 inch spacing produced an average of 1,033 jin per mu. Under the same cultivation conditions, strip close planting generally yields more than square close planting. The masses summarized the benefits of strip close planting, mainly because the wide rows are conducive to ventilation, light transmission, and field management operations such as middle tilling and pest control; at the same time, sufficient light in the wide rows can promote strong basal stalks, strong tissues, and resistance to lodging, and there are fewer diseases and insect pests.

Increasing main stalks and relying on main spikes to increase production is a production increase principle summarized by Hunan farmers during the Great Leap Forward last year, and it is also a major development in rice cultivation science by the farmers. Due to the implementation of dense rice planting, natural conditions such as sunlight and ventilation in the fields have changed, and rice tillering has been restricted. At the same time, according to the climate change patterns in Hunan, there are often cold waves below 18 degrees Celsius attacking during the early rice tillering period in early and mid-May, while early rice tillering requires temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius. Thus, early rice often misses the tillering opportunity, resulting in small spikes, small grains, and many empty shells. Last year's field survey in the Taiping Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County showed that the main spikes averaged 161.5 grains per spike, with an empty shell rate of only 17.9%; while the tillered spikes averaged only 98.4 grains per spike, with an empty shell rate as high as 31.4%. Many survey materials show that under the current cultivation conditions, adopting the method of increasing main stalks and relying on main spikes, concentrating the main nutrients on the main spikes, can achieve more spikes, more grains, heavier grains, reduce empty shells, and ensure a bumper harvest of early rice.

    湖南因地制宜总结早稻增产经验
    条形密植　依靠主穗　确保丰收
    放宽行距，缩短株距，通风透光　增加本秧，穗多粒重，减少空壳
    本报长沙29日电　如何解决早稻密植与通风、日照等生长条件之间的矛盾？如何保证早稻穗多、粒多、粒重全面丰收？湖南各地在早稻插秧之前，发动群众总结去年密植丰产的经验中，找到了条形密植、增加本秧、依靠主穗等有效的增产办法。为了保证今年全省一千八百多万亩早稻的全面丰收，中共湖南省委最近专门布置了在早稻插秧中普遍推行这一合理密植的增产办法。省委根据当前全省深耕、多肥和耕作技术的改进等条件，要求各地因地制宜，一般早稻每蔸插八到十根本秧，每亩插三、四万蔸或四、五万蔸，一般每亩以插本秧三十万根左右为宜。各地都根据省委指示精神，从本地区条件出发，发动群众鸣放辩论，总结去年丰产经验，认真贯彻了这一新的增产措施。现在，全省大部地区早稻已经播种，每亩早稻播下种谷二十斤到二十五斤，为今年推行这一新的增产措施打好了基础。
    去年全省各地插秧形式是多种多样的。有正方形、长方形，也有条形的。根据最近各地对比总结的结果，一般以行距宽一点、株距窄一点的条形密植增产显著。去年攸县宏文高级农业社的早稻对比试验，三乘三寸的方形密植，平均亩产九百三十七斤；而二乘六寸的条形密植，平均亩产一千零三十三斤。在同样的耕作条件下，条形密植一般比正方形密植增产。群众总结条形密植的好处，主要是因为宽行有利于禾苗通风、透光和便于进行中耕、除虫等田间管理工作；同时宽行光照足，能促使基秆粗壮，组织坚强，不易倒伏，病虫害也少。
    增加本秧，依靠主穗增产，是湖南农民在去年大跃进中总结出来的增产规律，也是农民群众在水稻栽培学上一个重大的发展。由于推行水稻密植，田间阳光、通风等自然条件发生了变化，水稻分蘖受到限制。同时，根据湖南气候变化规律，在5月上、中旬早稻分蘖期，常有低于摄氏十八度的寒潮袭击，而早稻分蘖需要有摄氏二十度以上的温度，这样早稻就常常错过分蘖机会，发生穗小、粒小、空壳多等现象。去年，醴陵县太平高级农业社的田间调查，主穗平均每穗有一百六十一点五粒，空壳率只有17.9％；而分蘖穗平均每穗只有九十八点四粒，空壳率高达31.4％。许多调查材料都说明，在当前耕作条件下，采取增加本秧、依靠主穗的办法，把主要养分都集中在主穗上，就能做到穗多、粒多、粒重，减少空壳，确保早稻丰收。
