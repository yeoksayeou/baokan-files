Good Methods for Propagating Tea Seedlings

In order to develop tea production more quickly and extensively, tea garden acreage will see a great expansion this year. According to the plans of Sichuan, Hubei, and Zhejiang provinces, the expanded area this year will reach four million mu. To ensure the completion of the task of expanding tea garden acreage, the first step is to focus on the seedling stage and arrange seedling production early according to the development plan. In 1958, the national production of tea seeds was estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 dan. Based on a sowing rate of 15 jin per mu, this is only enough to open up 1.4 to 2 million mu of tea gardens, far from meeting the needs. Currently, the main way to solve the shortage of seeds is to vigorously promote short-shoot cuttings and use other effective asexual reproduction methods to propagate seedlings in large quantities.

Short-Shoot Cuttings Short-shoot cuttings were created by farmers in Anxi, Fujian. Because the cuttings used are short (generally 0.8 to 1 inch long), they are called short-shoot cuttings. This is currently the most effective way to solve the seedling shortage. Using short-shoot cuttings for seedling propagation can utilize cuttings more economically than using long-shoot cuttings. At the same time, short-shoot cuttings root faster, have a higher survival rate, and produce better seedling growth than long-shoot cuttings. The technical aspects of short-shoot cuttings are not complicated. As long as relatively tender branches are selected as cuttings, and attention is paid to shading and frequent watering after insertion, a high survival rate can be guaranteed. In southern areas where the winter is not very cold, cuttings can be taken year-round. Spring cuttings can be transplanted from the nursery in the autumn of the same year. Jiangsu Province has also created a method of "raising seedlings with seedlings," delaying the transplanting of short-shoot cuttings for one year. In the second year, a portion of the upper part of the cuttings are cut again for insertion. In this way, one tea seedling can propagate four or five more seedlings, increasing the number of tea seedlings propagated.

Root Cuttings Root cuttings involve using the roots of the tea tree for cutting propagation. That is, when transplanting tea seedlings or transplanting old tea trees, excessively long main roots or some branch roots are cut off for cuttings. This is a method of utilizing waste materials. Root cutting technology is simple. Simply bury the cut root sections, two to four inches long, shallowly in the prepared nursery, without special management. The survival rate is very high. This method is suitable for filling gaps in old tea gardens.

Circular Layering This method involves layering all the large and small branches of the entire tea tree for seedling propagation. According to Fujian's experience, this method can propagate more than 100 to 200 tea seedlings per tea tree. Using the layering method guarantees 100% survival of tea seedlings and requires no special management. After the layers have rooted and grown, they can be transplanted. Using this method, one mu of old tea garden can supply the seedlings needed for one hundred mu of new tea garden. (Images attached)

    繁育茶树种苗的好方法
    为了更多更快的发展茶叶生产，今年茶园面积将有很大的发展，根据四川、湖北、浙江三省的计划，今年扩大面积将达四百万亩。为了保证扩大茶园面积任务的完成，首先应抓好种苗这一环，根据发展计划及早安排种苗生产。1958年全国估计生产茶子二十到三十万担，按每亩播种十五斤计算，只能开辟茶园一百四十至二百万亩，远不能满足需要，目前解决种子不足的主要途径，就是要大搞短穗扦插育苗和采用其他有效的无性繁殖方法大量繁育苗木。
    短穗扦插短穗扦插是福建安溪农民创造的，由于扦插所用的插穗短（插穗一般长八分至一寸）所以叫短穗扦插。这是目前解决种苗不足的最有效的办法。采用短穗扦插育苗比用长穗扦插，可以更经济利用插穗。同时短穗扦插还比长穗扦插发根快，成活率高，苗木生长好。短穗扦插的技术性并不复杂，只要选择较嫩的枝条作插穗，扦插后注意遮荫及经常灌水就可以保证很高的成活率。在南方冬季不甚寒冷的地方，一年四季都可以进行扦插。春季扦插当年秋季就可以出圃移植。江苏省还创造了“以苗养苗”的办法，使短穗扦插的茶苗推迟一年出圃，在第二年从扦插的茶苗上部再剪取一部分插条进行扦插，这样一株茶苗就可以多繁四、五株茶苗，增加茶苗的繁殖数量。
    根插　根插是用茶树的根进行扦插育苗，就是在移栽茶苗或移植老茶树的时候剪取过长的主根或部分支根进行扦插。这是一种废物利用的方法。根插技术简单，只须将剪下的二到四寸长的根段浅埋入整理好的苗圃中即可，无需特殊的管理，成活率很高，这个办法适合于老茶园的补缺。
    环状压条　这个方法是将整丛茶树的大小枝条全部进行压条育苗。根据福建的经验，用这个方法每丛茶树可以繁殖茶苗一百多株到二百株。用压条的方法繁殖可保证100％的茶苗成活，也无需特殊的管理。在压条生根长大后就可以进行移植。用这个方法，一亩老茶园就可以供给一百亩新茶园所需种苗。（附图片）
