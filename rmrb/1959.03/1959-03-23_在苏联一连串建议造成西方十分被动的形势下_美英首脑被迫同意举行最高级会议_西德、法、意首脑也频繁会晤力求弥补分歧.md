Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 22nd, TASS dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan and US President Eisenhower have been negotiating for two days.

The press officers of the United States and Britain issued a statement to reporters yesterday, saying that Macmillan and Eisenhower had reached an agreement on holding a summit conference this summer to discuss the Berlin issue. It can be seen from this statement and the first batch of comments in American newspapers that Eisenhower was forced to abandon his conditions put forward not long ago--agreeing to convene a summit conference only if the foreign ministers' meeting made the necessary "progress."

United Press International commentator Hans Le quoted well-informed sources in this regard, saying that even if the foreign ministers' meeting did not achieve any major achievements, such as reaching an agreement on what issues the heads of government would discuss, Eisenhower would agree to hold a summit conference. "New York Times" reporter Middleton also pointed out: "According to authoritative sources, the convening of the summit conference is not conditional on the success or failure of the foreign ministers' meeting."

At the same time, it can be seen from newspaper comments that the British Prime Minister retreated from his previous position on a series of issues that should be discussed with the Soviet Union during his talks with Eisenhower. Many commentators say that the talks were conducted on the basis of "mutual concessions," and the positions of the two Western countries agreed upon by Eisenhower and Macmillan are a "compromise" between the United States and Britain. It is reported that British officials believe that putting forward "unrealistic goals" in the upcoming talks would not yield good results, so the West should show a more realistic attitude towards the talks. However, "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Donovan said that the serious problem is: to what extent can the West make itself "flexible". He wrote: "For example, there are some proposals that the United States is willing to discuss, but the United States will take an extremely cautious attitude towards these proposals."

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: After the Soviet government put forward a series of constructive proposals on the Berlin issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the Western governments, which are in a very passive diplomatic position, are frequently holding summit meetings to seek ways to get rid of the current Western diplomatic crisis and make up for the differences and contradictions exposed in their approaches to the Soviet proposals due to their different interests.

The talks between British Prime Minister Macmillan and US President Eisenhower at the President's villa in Camp David, near Washington, are the most notable of the Western talks. It is generally believed that this US-British summit will conduct decision-making discussions on some important issues in the East-West talks.

Macmillan and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd arrived in Washington from Ottawa on the 19th. They held talks with Eisenhower and others on the 20th and 21st, and are scheduled to continue the talks today.

It is reported that the issue of the East-West summit, the situation in Berlin and Germany, and the West's attitude towards the cessation of nuclear testing have been the focus of discussions in the past two days. In addition, the talks also discussed a proposal put forward by the United Kingdom to "freeze troops and weapons at a certain level" in the Central European region.

It is expected that the two sides will discuss the Middle East situation today. According to reports, US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree, who is in charge of Middle East affairs, will participate in this discussion.

While Eisenhower and Macmillan are holding talks, the West German and French governments, which have always been suspicious of Britain's attitude, are closely watching the progress of the talks. It is said that the situation of the US-British talks has been notified to Bonn and Paris "immediately".

At the same time, on the day Macmillan set off for the Americas, Italian Prime Minister Segni and Foreign Minister Pella also arrived in Paris to hold two days of talks with De Gaulle and Debré. Afterwards, they went to Bonn to hold talks with Adenauer and Brentano. Before Macmillan went to the Americas, Italian Foreign Minister Pella also went to London to talk with him. According to Western news agencies, in this meeting, the main concern of the Italian government was to enable Italy to have a say in the possible East-West talks.

In addition, according to a French government announcement on the 21st, French Prime Minister Debré and Foreign Minister De Murville will go to London on April 13 to hold talks with the British government again.

### 在苏联一连串建议造成西方十分被动的形势下  美英首脑被迫同意举行最高级会议  西德、法、意首脑也频繁会晤力求弥补分歧

    在苏联一连串建议造成西方十分被动的形势下
    美英首脑被迫同意举行最高级会议
    西德、法、意首脑也频繁会晤力求弥补分歧
    据新华社22日讯　塔斯社纽约22日讯：英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔的谈判已经进行了两天。
    美国和英国的新闻发布官昨天向记者发表声明说，麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔就今年夏天举行讨论柏林问题的最高级会议达成了协议。从这个声明和美国报纸第一批的评论中可以看出，艾森豪威尔被迫放弃了他不久前提出的条件——只有在外长会议取得必要“进展”的情况下，才同意召开最高级会议。
    合众国际社评论员汉斯莱在这方面引用消息灵通人士的话说，即使外长会议没有取得什么较大的成就，例如就政府首脑将讨论什么问题达成协议，艾森豪威尔也将同意举行最高级会议。“纽约时报”记者密德尔顿也指出：“据权威人士说，最高级会议的召开并不以外长会议的成败为前提”。
    同时，从报纸的评论中可以看出，英国首相在同艾森豪威尔会谈中在应当同苏联进行讨论的一系列问题上从他以前的立场上后退了。许多评论员说，会谈是在“互相让步”的基础上进行的，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦所商定的两个西方国家的立场是美国和英国之间的一个“折衷”。据报道，英国人士认为，西方国家在即将举行的会谈中提出“不现实的目标”将不会得到良好的结果，因此西方应该对会谈表现出更现实的态度。但“纽约先驱论坛报”记者杜诺万说，严重的问题在于：西方能够使自己“灵活”到多大程度。他写道：“例如，有一些建议美国是愿意讨论的，但是，美国对这些建议将采取极其慎重的态度。”
    据新华社22日讯　在苏联政府就柏林问题和缔结对德和约问题提出了一连串建设性建议之后，在外交上处于十分被动地位的西方各国政府正在频繁地进行首脑级会谈，以寻求摆脱目前西方的外交危机的办法，并弥补一下它们在如何对付苏联的建议的作法上由于各自利害不同而暴露出来的分歧和矛盾。
    英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔正在华盛顿附近的戴维营总统别墅进行的会谈是西方会谈中最引人注目的一次，一般认为，这次美英首脑会谈将就东西方会谈中的一些重要问题进行决策性的讨论。
    麦克米伦同英国外交大臣劳埃德是在19日从渥太华到达华盛顿的。他们在20日和21日同艾森豪威尔等进行了会谈，预定今天还要继续会谈。
    据报道，东西方最高级会议的问题、柏林和德国的局势问题以及西方对停止核试验的态度是两天来会谈的讨论中心，此外，会谈还讨论了英国提出的一项所谓在中欧地区“把军队和武器冻结在一定水平上”的建议。
    预定双方将在今天讨论中东局势，消息说，负责中东事务的美国助理国务卿朗特里将参加这次讨论。
    在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦进行会谈的时候，一直对英国的态度心存疑惧的西德和法国政府正在密切注视着会谈的进展。据说，美英会谈的情况已经“立即”通知了波恩和巴黎。
    同时，在麦克米伦启程到美洲去的那一天，意大利总理塞尼和外交部长贝拉也到达巴黎，同戴高乐和德勃雷举行了两天的会谈。随后又到波恩同阿登纳和勃伦塔诺举行会谈。而在麦克米伦去美洲以前，意大利外交部长贝拉也曾去伦敦同他会谈。据西方通讯社透露，在这次会谈中，意大利政府主要关心的事情是：使意大利在可能举行的东西方会谈中也能插上一脚。
    另外，据法国政府21日宣布，法国总理德勃雷和外交部长德姆维尔将于4月13日去伦敦，再度同英国政府进行会谈。
