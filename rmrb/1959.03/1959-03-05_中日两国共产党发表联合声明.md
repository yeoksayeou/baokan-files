Joint Statement of the Delegations of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Japan

In order to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and to further consolidate and develop the unity between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Japan, the Japanese Communist Party delegation, led by Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, visited the People's Republic of China on February 23, 1959.

During the visit, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with the Japanese Communist Party delegation, and had cordial talks and exchanged views with the delegates.

During the visit, the Japanese Communist Party delegation held talks with the Chinese Communist Party delegation on issues related to the current international situation, the situation in the Far East, Sino-Japanese relations, and the relations between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Japan.

Representing the Communist Party of China in the talks were: Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Peng Zhen, Member of the Political Bureau; and Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Central Secretariat.

Representing the Japanese Communist Party in the talks were Kenji Miyamoto，General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party; and Shoichi Kasuga, Member of Presidium of the Central Committee.

The talks were conducted in an extremely warm and friendly atmosphere. During the discussions and exchange of views, both sides reached complete agreement on the issues discussed.

The two party delegations unanimously affirmed that the current international situation is characterized by the continued prevalence of the East wind over the West wind, which is greatly conducive to the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national independence, and democratic progress. The strength of the socialist camp and the world's forces for peace and progress have now overwhelmed the forces of the imperialist camp headed by the United States; the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing; and the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national independence, and democratic freedom is also growing stronger. The economic crisis's impact on the imperialist countries, as well as the fragmentation among them caused by numerous internal contradictions within the imperialist camp, has further weakened the strength of the imperialist camp. All of these situations indicate that the struggle of the people of all countries for world peace, national independence, and social progress is getting better day by day, while imperialism is rotting day by day.

U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly adhering to its policies of aggression and war. The two party delegations emphasized that the unbridled actions of U.S. imperialism in the Far East have greatly poisoned the situation in the Far East. U.S. imperialism is still continuing its semi-occupation of Japan, occupying Japan's Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands, basically depriving Japan of its independence, and occupying China's Taiwan and southern Korea. Not only that, but U.S. imperialism has also established a large number of military bases in the Far East, attempting to transport even more nuclear weapons into the Far East, stepping up control over the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and attempting to establish a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization including Japan. These aggressive crimes of the U.S. imperialists not only threaten and infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of the countries in the Far East, but also seriously undermine the security and peace of the people of the countries in the Far East, fully demonstrating that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia and the world. The two party delegations expressed strong condemnation of the U.S. imperialist's evil policy of threatening peace in the Far East and infringing upon national sovereignty. In order to safeguard the security and peace of the Far East, the Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated the establishment of a zone of peace in the Far East and the Pacific, the signing of a Far East Peace Pact, and a Sino-Japanese non-aggression treaty. The Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic and democratic forces of Japan advocate the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia. Recently, Comrade Khrushchev, at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, also proposed the initiative to establish a zone of peace in the Far East and the entire Pacific region, first and foremost the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone. All these proposals are fully in line with the aspirations of the people of the Far East. The two party delegations declared that they will continue their efforts and wage a resolute struggle to realize these proposals.

The two party delegations are closely following the current development of the Japanese situation, especially the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," revive Japanese militarism, and make Japan a war base in the Far East even more blatantly. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people have always believed that only when Japan gets rid of U.S. control and becomes an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral country will it be in the interests of the Japanese people and conducive to peace in the Far East. The Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people resolutely advocate the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, the abolition of U.S. military bases in Japan, and return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people resolutely support this just and patriotic demand of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party and the patriotic and democratic forces of Japan have also expressed stern condemnation of the U.S. imperialists' criminal activities of occupying the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait area. The Communist Party of China expresses its gratitude to the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people for these activities.

China and Japan are close neighbors, and they have close historical ties. Therefore, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and the conduct of close economic and cultural exchanges are not only beneficial to the people of the two countries, who have a population of nearly 800 million, but also to the maintenance of peace in the Far East. However, thirteen years have passed since the end of the war, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been restored, and economic and cultural ties have also been hindered and damaged. The responsibility for this extremely abnormal phenomenon lies entirely with the Japanese reactionary ruling group. They follow U.S. imperialism and are hostile to the People's Republic of China. Although they are now clamoring for so-called Sino-Japanese trade, this clamor is only a means to alleviate the pressure from the Japanese people demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries and to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people with the policies of the U.S. imperialists and Japanese reactionary forces. The two party delegations unanimously condemned the hypocritical tactics of the Japanese reactionaries; and believe that relying on the joint efforts of the people of China and Japan to eliminate all kinds of obstacles from the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces, the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and the development of economic, cultural exchanges and friendly contacts between the people of the two countries can certainly be realized.

The Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Japan are both Marxist-Leninist parties with common ideals and common goals. The two party delegations unanimously stated that consolidating and developing the unity of the international communist ranks is the sacred internationalist obligation of the two parties. In order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, the two parties unanimously agreed that the struggle against modern revisionism, represented by Yugoslavia, must be carried through to the end. In order to further strengthen the fraternal unity between the two parties, the two party delegations believe that it is necessary to strengthen exchanges between the two parties in order to promote friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Japan.

    新华社郑州4日电　中国共产党代表团同日本共产党代表团，3日下午在郑州签署关于两党的联合声明。这个联合声明是由中国共产党总书记邓小平和日本共产党总书记宫本显治分别代表两党签署的。
    签署两党联合声明时，中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东也在场。
    中共方面在场的还有：副主席刘少奇，政治局委员彭真，中央书记处书记王稼祥。
    日共方面在场的有：日共中央干部会委员春日正一。
    联合声明全文如下：
    中国共产党代表团和日本共产党代表团联合声明
    为了增进中日两国人民的友谊，进一步巩固和发展中国共产党和日本共产党之间的团结，由日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治率领的日本共产党代表团，在1959年2月23日来中华人民共和国进行访问。
    在访问期间，中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东会见了日本共产党代表团，同代表团的代表们进行了亲切的谈话和交换意见。
    在访问期间，日本共产党代表团同中国共产党代表团就有关当前国际形势，远东形势，中日两国关系，中共和日共两党关系的问题，进行了会谈。
    代表中国共产党参加会谈的有：中国共产党中央委员会总书记邓小平，政治局委员彭真和中央书记处书记王稼祥。
    代表日本共产党参加会谈的有：日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治，中央委员会干部会委员春日正一。
    会谈是在极其热烈友好的气氛中进行的。双方在讨论和交换意见中，对于所谈的问题都取得了完全一致的意见。
    两党代表团一致确认，目前国际形势的特点是东风继续压倒西风，大大有利于各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立和民主进步事业。现在社会主义阵营的力量和世界和平进步力量已经压倒了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动方兴未艾；各国人民要求世界和平、民族独立、民主自由的斗争也越来越趋于高涨。经济危机对于帝国主义国家的冲击，以及由于帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重而引起的它们之间的四分五裂的趋势，更加削弱了帝国主义阵营的力量。所有这些情况，表明了各国人民为世界和平、民族独立和社会进步的斗争形势一天天好起来，而帝国主义则是一天天烂下去。
    美帝国主义仍在顽固地坚持其侵略政策和战争政策。两党代表团强调指出，美帝国主义在远东地区的横行霸道大大地毒化了远东局势。现在美帝国主义仍然在日本继续着半占领状态，霸占了日本的冲绳岛和小笠原群岛，基本上剥夺了日本的独立，侵占着中国的台湾和朝鲜的南部。不仅这样，美帝国主义还在远东地区建立了大量的军事基地，企图把更为大量的核武器运进远东，加紧控制东南亚防务条约组织，妄图建立包括日本在内的东北亚条约组织等等。美帝国主义者的这些侵略罪行，不仅威胁和侵犯了远东各国的主权和独立，而且严重地破坏了远东各国人民的安全和和平，充分地显示了美帝国主义是亚洲和世界人民的共同敌人。两党代表团对于美帝国主义这种威胁远东和平和侵犯民族主权的罪恶政策，表示了强烈的谴责。为了保卫远东的安全和和平，中华人民共和国政府一贯地主张建立远东和太平洋的和平地区，签订远东和平公约和中日互不侵犯条约。日本共产党和日本的爱国民主力量主张在亚洲建立禁止核武器区。最近赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上又提出了在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平地区，首先是建立无原子武器地区的倡议。所有这些主张，是完全符合于远东人民的愿望的。两党代表团声明，将继续努力，为实现这些主张而进行坚决的斗争。
    两党代表团对于目前日本局势的发展，特别是关于美帝国主义勾结日本反动派，阴谋修改日美“安全条约”，复活日本军国主义，并且更加明目张胆地使日本成为远东的战争基地，表示密切的关注。日本共产党和日本人民向来认为只有当日本摆脱了美国的控制，变成为一个独立、民主、和平、中立的国家，才符合于日本人民的利益，才能有利于远东和平。日本共产党和日本人民坚决主张废除日美“安全条约”，撤退美国在日本的驻军，撤销美国在日本的军事基地，归还冲绳岛和小笠原群岛。中国共产党和中国人民坚决地支持日本共产党和日本人民的这一正义的和爱国的要求。对于美帝国主义侵占中华人民共和国的神圣领土台湾，并在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的罪恶活动，日本共产党和日本的爱国民主力量也表示了严正的声讨。中国共产党对于日本共产党和日本人民的这些活动表示感谢。
    中日两国是近邻之邦，它们在历史上有着密切的关系，因此中日两国建立邦交和进行密切的经济和文化交流，不仅有利于拥有近八亿人口的两国人民，而且有利于维护远东的和平。但是从战争结束以来，已经有十三年了，两国的邦交，迄今还未恢复，经济文化的联系亦受到了阻挠和破坏。造成这种极不正常现象的责任，完全在于日本的反动统治集团。他们追随美帝国主义，敌视中华人民共和国。虽然他们现在叫嚣着要进行什么中日贸易，但是这种叫嚣仅仅是一种手段，用来缓和日本人民要求恢复两国邦交的压力，缓和日本人民对美帝国主义者和日本反动势力的政策的不满。两党代表团一致谴责日本反动派的作伪手法；并且认为依靠中日两国人民的共同努力，排除美国和日本反动势力的种种阻碍，恢复中日两国的外交关系，发展两国人民之间的经济、文化交流和友好往来是一定能够实现的。
    中国共产党和日本共产党都是马克思列宁主义的政党，有着共同的理想和共同的目标。两党代表团一致表示巩固和发展国际共产主义队伍的团结是两党的国际主义的神圣义务。为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，两党一致同意，必须把反对以南斯拉夫为代表的现代修正主义的斗争，进行到底。为了进一步加强两党间的兄弟般的团结，两党代表团认为，必须加强两党之间的往来，以利于增进中日两国人民的友好和合作。中国共产党中央委员会总书记邓小平日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治1959年3月3日于郑州（附图片）
