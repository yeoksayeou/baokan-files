Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 20th: Representatives from various provinces and cities attending the National Rapeseed Production On-site Conference have resolved to launch a massive mass movement aimed at achieving per-mu rapeseed yields of 300 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin, and 1,000 jin, focusing on "strengthening field management, maintaining acreage, and increasing yields." They aim to win the first battle of oil production this year in order to fulfill and exceed this year's target of producing 6 million tons of edible vegetable oil.

This on-site conference was held by the Ministry of Agriculture from March 11th to 15th in Nanhui County, Shanghai Municipality. More than 160 representatives from twelve provinces and cities, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, attended the meeting.

These twelve provinces and cities are the main rapeseed production areas in the country, accounting for 96% of the country's total winter rapeseed acreage. This year, the growth of rapeseed in these areas is generally better than in the same period in previous years. Currently, rapeseed is universally bolting, and in the earlier seasons of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the Pearl River Basin area, some rapeseed has already entered the flowering stage.

The conference believes that the above situation is a favorable condition for striving for a greater rapeseed harvest. However, to secure a greater harvest, arduous efforts are still needed.

The conference studied the key to increasing rapeseed production. Everyone believes that the current bolting and flowering period of rapeseed is the critical period that determines the number of branches, the number of pods, the number of seeds, and the seed weight. From the beginning of bolting, rapeseed grows extremely rapidly, with the main stem, branches, and flower buds all appearing simultaneously. At this time, it is urgent to supply them with sufficient fertilizer multiple times, especially to apply more bolting fertilizer. During the flowering period, it is necessary to apply flower fertilizer multiple times continuously so that it produces more flowers, every flower is fertilized and sets pods, pods are full from the base to the tip, and the seeds are plump and full. Only in this way can the goal of increasing production be achieved. Therefore, the conference believes that all localities should seize the opportunity to immediately launch a field management movement centered on topdressing to successfully navigate the bolting and flowering stages.

The conference believes that timely harvesting and returning the grains home is the key to ensuring a bumper harvest. Currently, most areas are only about eighty days away from the rapeseed harvest. All localities should prepare tools as soon as possible and harvest when 70-80% of the rapeseed turns "loquat yellow," as delays will cause losses. This year, attention should also be paid to seed selection during the harvest, reserving the strong, heavy rapeseed seeds for use as seeds.

The conference requires all localities to maintain the rapeseed planting area and not to arbitrarily plow it under for green manure or eat it as vegetables. For rapeseed that is temporarily growing poorly, it is necessary to strengthen management with a positive spirit and take various measures to quickly upgrade it, striving to harvest from every mu that is planted.

During the conference, representatives from various localities widely exchanged advanced experiences in rapeseed production and conducted on-site visits and learning in counties such as Nanhui, Pudong, and Shanghai. The representatives highly praised the advanced methods of rapeseed cultivation in the suburbs of Shanghai and the particularly robust growth of rapeseed at present.

Before the conclusion of the conference, representatives from ten counties, including Zhong County and Xindu in Sichuan, Macheng and Songzi in Hubei, Jinsha in Guizhou, Xinghua in Jiangsu, Xupu in Hunan, Ruian in Zhejiang, and Nanhui and Pudong in Shanghai, proposed to all parts of the country to launch a high-yield competition for large areas of rapeseed to achieve 300 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin, and 1,000 jin per mu.

### 以追肥为中心加强油菜田间管理  多开花　多结荚　多增产

    以追肥为中心加强油菜田间管理
    多开花　多结荚　多增产
    据新华社上海20日电　参加全国油菜生产现场会议的各省市代表，决心开展一个规模巨大的以亩产菜籽三百斤、五百斤、八百斤和一千斤为目标的“加强田间管理、保持面积、提高产量”的群众运动，力争打胜今年油料生产的第一仗，以便完成和超额完成今年生产六百万吨食用植物油的任务。
    这个现场会议是农业部于3月11日到15日在上海市所属南汇县召开的。出席会议的有四川、云南、贵州、湖南、湖北、广东、江西、河南、安徽、江苏、浙江和上海等十二个省市代表一百六十多人。
    这十二个省市是全国油菜的主要产区，种植面积占全国冬油菜总面积96％。今年这些地区的油菜生长情况，一般都比往年同期好。目前油菜正在普遍抽苔，季节较早的云贵高原到珠江流域一带，部分油菜已进入开花期。
    会议认为，上述情况，是力争油菜籽更大丰收的有利条件，但是，要把更大丰收争取到手，还需要作艰巨的努力。
    会议研究了油菜增产的关键。大家认为，当前油菜抽苔、开花时期，正是决定分枝数、结荚数、粒数和粒重的关键时期。油菜从抽苔开始，它的生长极为迅速，主苔、分枝、花蕾都同时出现，这时急需多次供应它们充分的肥料，特别要多施抽苔肥，在开花期，还要多次连续施花肥。使它开花多、花花受精结荚，结荚满尖到顶，籽粒充实饱满，这样才能达到增产目的。为此，会议认为，各地应该抓紧时机，立即开展一个以追肥为中心的田间管理运动，过好抽苔、开花关。
    会议认为，适时收割，颗粒还家，是保证丰产丰收的关键。现在，大部地区距离油菜收获只有八十天左右。各地应及早准备工具，在油菜有七、八成呈现枇杷黄时就应该收获，迟了就会造成损失。今年收获时还应注意选种，把健壮的粒重的油菜籽留作种子。
    会议要求各地保持油菜播种面积，不要随意翻耕沤青或是当作蔬菜吃掉；对暂时生长较差的油菜，必须以积极精神，加强管理，采取多种措施使它迅速升级，力争种一亩收一亩。
    会议期间，各地代表广泛地交流了油菜生产的先进经验，并在南汇、浦东、上海等县进行了现场参观和学习。代表们对上海市郊区种植油菜的先进方法和目前油菜生长特别健壮的情况，都十分赞扬。
    会议结束前，四川忠县、新都，湖北麻城、松滋，贵州金沙，江苏兴化，湖南溆浦，浙江瑞安，上海市南汇、浦东等十县的代表向全国各地提出了开展油菜大面积的三百斤、五百斤、八百斤和一千斤的丰产竞赛倡议。（附图片）
