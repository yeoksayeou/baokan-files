Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, March 2nd. The workers of Benxi Steel Plant, one of the advanced units in electric furnace steelmaking in the fourth quarter of last year, proposed a high-yield, high-quality Red Flag competition among national electric furnace steelmaking plants.

    Shi Diansheng, Deputy Secretary of the Benxi Steel Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, announced the competition conditions to national electric furnace steelmaking plants on behalf of all the plant's workers at the Benxi Municipal Industrial and Mining Enterprises High-Yield Red Flag Celebration and Competition Conference, which closed on February 28th: (1) Increase the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces (including automatic electric furnaces and basic electric furnaces) from an average of 28 tons for the entire year last year to an average of 33.15 tons for the entire year this year, with the utilization coefficient of cold charging for automatic electric furnaces reaching 37 tons; (2) Improve the quality of steel, with products meeting national standards averaging over 99% for the entire year; (3) Increase variety, successfully trial-produce 140 new steel grades throughout the year; (4) Complete the production plan according to the variety and contract delivery date. In order to achieve the competition conditions, they decided to summarize and absorb the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and set off a Red Flag competition upsurge centered on technical revolution. At the same time, they will learn from the experience of advanced units across the country, further adopt technical measures such as more charging and rapid smelting, and rapid desulfurization and dephosphorization to break through key links in production.

    In the second half of last year, Benxi Steel Plant carried out a friendly competition with Dalian Steel Plant. In January of this year, due to technical problems such as excessive sulfur and phosphorus content in raw materials not being well resolved, the original leap forward plan targets were not completed, and the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces was also lower than that of Dalian Steel Plant. Since February, the workers have put forward the battle cry of "Oppose Conservatism and Strive for the Upstream, Technical Revolution Breaks Through Five Barriers, High Yield, High Quality, and More Varieties, Strive for Leading Electric Furnace Coefficient," vigorously carrying out technical innovation, breaking through many key problems, and rapidly improving the production level. In the recent ten days, the average daily output of steel has increased by more than 30% compared to January. Now, the workers' production enthusiasm is even higher, and they guarantee to complete the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule, creating a good foundation for completing the annual competition targets.

    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, March 2nd. The workers of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant, who have maintained the national iron smelting Red Flag for ten consecutive months, proposed a high-yield, high-quality Red Flag competition among national iron smelting plants.

    Their competition proposal was announced by Deputy Director Zuo Fengyi at the Benxi Municipal Industrial and Mining Enterprises High-Yield Red Flag Celebration and Competition Conference, which closed on February 28th. In their proposal, they stated: They decided to further vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and increase the comprehensive technical and economic indicator that marks the production level of blast furnaces – the utilization coefficient of blast furnace effective volume – from an average of 1.826 tons for the entire year last year to an average of 2.3 tons this year, striving to reach 2.4 tons, as the main condition for carrying out competition with fraternal iron smelting plants across the country. With the realization of this indicator, the plant's pig iron production will increase significantly compared to last year without adding equipment or carrying out major blast furnace repairs.

    In the proposal, the workers of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant put forward specific measures to achieve the competition targets, mainly to launch a mass movement centered on technical revolution and vigorously solve key problems in production; organize mass communist cooperation and carry out cooperation and competition between workshops and teams within the plant; further implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" industrial constitution. In terms of technology, the main focus is to continue to adopt the operating principles of increasing smelting intensity, increasing coke burden, and reducing idle time. It was decided to fully adopt trumpet-shaped tuyeres on the blast furnace through technical experiments, which have a great effect on increasing smelting intensity, to use a large number of spherical pellet ore, improve the cooling efficiency and lifespan of the tuyere water jacket, further increase the hot blast furnace temperature to 1100 degrees, and strengthen coke classification and raw material management to ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed and well-nourished.

    Before and after proposing the competition initiative to national iron smelting plants, the production enthusiasm of the workers of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant was unprecedentedly high, and they launched a vigorous high-yield movement. Through technical innovation, they broke through many key production problems, continuously improving the production level. Since mid-February, the average daily output of pig iron has increased by more than 5% compared to the first ten days of the month and by 11% compared to January.

    本溪钢厂向全国电炉发出倡议
    开展高产优质红旗竞赛
    连获炼铁红旗的本溪第一钢铁厂也提出了竞赛条件
    新华社本溪2日电　去年第四季度获得全国电炉炼钢先进单位之一的本溪钢厂职工，倡议全国电炉炼钢厂之间开展高产优质红旗竞赛。
    中共本溪钢厂委员会副书记史殿胜代表全厂职工，在2月28日闭幕的本溪市工矿企业高产红旗庆功比武大会上，宣布了他们向全国电炉炼钢厂的竞赛条件：（1）电炉利用系数（包括自动电炉和笨式电炉）从去年全年平均二十八吨提高到今年全年平均三十三点一五吨，其中自动电炉冷装利用系数要达到三十七吨；（2）提高钢的质量，合乎国家标准的产品全年平均达到99％以上；
  （3）增加品种，全年试制成功新钢种一百四十种；（4）按品种按合同交货日期，完成生产计划。为了实现竞赛条件，他们决定总结和吸收去年大跃进的丰富经验，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，掀起一个以技术革命为中心内容的红旗竞赛热潮，同时学习全国先进单位的经验，进一步采取多装快炼、快速去硫去磷等技术措施，突破生产上的关键环节。
    本溪钢厂去年下半年同大连钢厂开展了友谊竞赛。今年1月份，由于原料含硫、磷过高等技术问题没有很好解决，原订跃进计划指标没有完成，电炉利用系数也低于大连钢厂。2月份以来，职工们提出
  “反对保守争上游，技术革命破五关，高产优质多品种，争取电炉系数领先”的战斗口号，大搞技术革新，破除了许多关键问题，生产水平迅速提高。最近十天内钢的日产量平均比1月份提高30％以上。现在，职工们的生产情绪更加高昂，他们保证提前完成第一季度的生产计划，给完成全年竞赛指标创造良好的基础。
    新华社本溪2日电　连续十个月保持全国炼铁红旗的本溪第一钢铁厂职工，倡议全国炼铁厂之间开展高产优质红旗竞赛。
    他们的竞赛倡议书，是由副厂长左凤仪在2月28日闭幕的本溪市工矿企业高产红旗庆功比武大会上宣布的。他们在倡议书中提出：决定进一步大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，把标志着高炉生产水平的综合技术经济指标——高炉有效容积利用系数，从去年全年平均一点八二六吨提高到今年平均二点三吨，争取达到二点四吨，以此作为同全国兄弟炼铁厂开展竞赛的主要条件。这个指标实现，全厂全年在不增添设备和不进行高炉大修的情况下，生铁产量将比去年增长很多。
    本溪第一钢铁厂职工在倡议书中，提出了实现竞赛指标的具体措施，主要是开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，大力解决生产上的关键问题；组织群众性的共产主义协作，开展厂内各车间、各班组之间的协作竞赛；进一步贯彻“两参一改三结合”的工业宪法。在技术方面，主要是继续采用提高冶炼强度、提高焦炭负荷和降低休风率的操作方针。决定通过技术试验，在高炉上全部采用对提高冶炼强度有很大作用的喇叭型大风口，大量使用球型团矿，提高风口水套的冷却效率和水套的寿命，进一步提高热风炉温度到一千一百度，加强焦炭分级和原料管理，保证高炉吃的饱、吃的好。
    在向全国炼铁厂提出竞赛倡议前后，本溪第一钢铁厂职工生产热情空前高昂，开展了轰轰烈烈的高产运动，通过技术革新，突破了许多生产关键问题，使生产水平不断提高。从2月中旬以来，生铁平均日产量比上旬提高5％以上，比1月份提高11％。
