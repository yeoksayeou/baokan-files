An Example of Combining Romanticism and Realism
—— Reflections on the Sichuan Opera "The Romance in the Cabinet"
Ai Wu

Studying how romanticism and realism are combined from our classical literary and dramatic heritage will undoubtedly be of great help to our study of this issue today.

The plays performed by the Sichuan Opera Troupe in Beijing, in my opinion, contain both romanticism and realism, and the two are well combined. I would like to take the play "The Romance in the Cabinet" as an example. A rural girl named Yu Lian stays at home to look after the house. Her mother, Liu Zhao, and her brother, Liu Chun, have gone to their uncle's house. Suddenly, a young man fleeing from pursuers rushes in. Liu Yu Lian is extremely anxious and has no choice but to hide the young man in the cabinet. After the officers leave, the mother returns and discovers that the fleeing young man is actually Yue Lei, the son of their benefactor, Yue Fei. She proposes to marry Liu Yu Lian to him, hence the name "The Romance in the Cabinet." The structure and plot of this story are legendary, that is, romantic.

However, the living environment in which the story takes place is that of an ordinary rural family. And the mother and daughter are also ordinary villagers. At the beginning of the story, the mother, Liu Zhao (played by Dai Xueru), plans to return to her parents' home to discuss with her uncle about finding a son-in-law for her daughter, but she also wants to know her daughter's thoughts, what kind of husband she wants. Although she usually guesses a bit, she always wants to ask clearly. The daughter wants to express her desire for a young man who has studied, but she is too embarrassed to say it. These are all common situations for rural mothers and daughters at that time, which often happen in reality. Therefore, the beginning of the drama is realistic.

When the mother and brother leave, a young man fleeing for his life suddenly breaks into the house, and the girl, Liu Yu Lian (played by Xiao Xifeng), is panicked. This immediately transforms an ordinary rural home into a special environment, shrouded in a strange atmosphere, which is very romantic. The young man who fled is fleeing because his father, Yue Fei, was murdered by the treacherous minister Qin Hui. He escaped and hid in the cabinet of a villager's house. This action is not common, and it is also very romantic. His extraordinary actions lead to an extraordinary engagement. Thus, the entire play appears to be a legendary drama, filled with a strong color of romanticism.

Although the mother, daughter, son, and the young man fleeing for his life are all active in this special environment and are all dominated by bizarre plots, they are all realistic characters, with their own personalities and their own living habits. They deal with this extraordinary event based on their personalities and living habits. For example, when Liu Yu Lian lets Yue Lei hide in her house and is about to close the door, the officers happen to arrive and knock on the door, asking loudly, "Has a young master come here?" She is extremely terrified and doesn't know how to answer. Yue Lei quickly waves his hand at her, and she replies to the outside, "No, no one came." Officer B says falsely, "We saw him go in!" Liu Yu Lian hurriedly says to Yue Lei, "Oh dear, they saw you come in!" Yue Lei quickly whispers to Liu Yu Lian, "Just say there's really no one here." Liu Yu Lian then answers to the outside in a panic, "Re-really, there's no one here." Officer A asks again outside the door, "Where did you see him run off to?" Liu Yu Lian just asks Yue Lei in a panic, "Hey, where did you run off to?" Yue Lei whispers to tell her, "Just say he went west." Liu Yu Lian is so frightened that she dares not answer anymore, and asks Yue Lei to say it himself. In the end, she has no choice but to answer to the outside in a panic, "Just say—he went west." Isn't this segment a very true depiction of the terrified and confused childish scene of a sixteen-year-old girl encountering an extraordinary event? In addition, this little girl also has a feisty side. When the two officers come back to knock on the door and even come in to search, she suddenly throws herself on the cabinet and starts acting tough: "My goodness, this cabinet is filled with our old clothes, no men are allowed to look at it. You are not officers, you are clearly robbers coming to rob me, I'm going to fight you." She takes a stick and beats the officers randomly, shouting loudly, "Robbery, they're robbing us." This also vividly portrays the childish and reckless personality of a rural girl. This is a realistic description method, but there are also elements of romanticism. Because the characters' actions, words, and expressions are not expressed through daily life, but in extraordinary events. From this, we can see that romanticism and realism are organically linked together. The reason why they can be organically linked is through the characters' personalities. Because the life of literature and art, at least, must be rich in character. Whether the drama itself is vivid depends on whether the actors perform the characters' personalities well. Realistic characters all have personalities. Conversely, characters who are rich in personality are also rich in reality. Good actors are able to understand the characters' personalities, and then deal with the extraordinary events that occur in the play according to their personalities. In extraordinary events, every action, every word, every expression comes from their personality, and the sense of reality and life that the audience receives is naturally very strong. If a drama performance can bring out the atmosphere of life and give the audience a sense of reality, then no matter how bizarre the story is, no matter how rare it is in the world, it will not make people disbelieve it. And where is the role of romanticism? It is through the extraordinary plot to more prominently express the characters' personalities, generating great appeal and making the entire play full of brilliance.

Here we can discern a certain pattern, that is, the combination of romanticism and realism first lies in grasping the characters' personalities. We must have a full understanding of the characters' personalities and express the characters' personalities through actions, words, and expressions in any event, large or small, ordinary or extraordinary, without losing their personality. I think grasping a person's personality is not easy. Because other people's personalities are either not possessed by the author and actors themselves, or are possessed but very little. We must conduct multi-faceted research, observing from the characters' origins, age, living habits, and upbringing, etc., to obtain it. And what is even more difficult is to allow the characters' personalities to cope with everything in the large and small events that they have never experienced, and still achieve a reasonable and appropriate level. This requires more research in various aspects of life. The depth of the actors' grasp of the characters' personalities, and whether they cope appropriately in the large and small events of the plot, will make a big difference in the audience's feelings. Our literary and art workers can indeed learn a lot from Sichuan Opera, especially from the actors.

    浪漫主义和现实主义结合一例
    ——川剧“柜中缘”观后感
    艾芜
    我们从古典文学戏剧遗产中，研究浪漫主义和现实主义是怎样结合的，这对于我们今天研究这个问题，一定有不少的帮助。
    四川来京公演的川剧团演出的戏，我看它们就是有浪漫主义，也有现实主义，而且两者是结合的好的。我想举出“柜中缘”这个戏来谈谈。有个叫玉莲的农村姑娘，留在家里看守屋子，母亲刘赵氏和哥哥刘春都到舅舅家去了，忽然有个青年逃进门来，后面还有差役追赶。刘玉莲急得要命，只好让青年躲在柜子里。差役去后，母亲回来，发现逃难的青年，原来是恩人岳飞的儿子岳雷，便主张把刘玉莲嫁他，因而名为“柜中缘”。这个故事的结构和情节，就是传奇的，也就是浪漫主义的。
    但发生故事的生活环境，却是一般的乡下人家。而母亲女儿，也都是一般的乡下人。故事开始的时候，母亲刘赵氏（戴雪如扮演）打算回娘家，同舅舅商量，要为女儿找一个女婿，但又想知道女儿的心事，到底是要怎样的丈夫，虽然平日也猜到几分，可是总想问个明白。女儿呢，想说出自己的心意是要个读过书的青年，可又不好意思说出口。这都是当时一般乡下母女的情形，现实中常常发生的。因此，戏剧一开始，是现实主义的。
    等到母亲哥哥走了，一个逃难的青年忽然闯进家来，姑娘刘玉莲（萧熙凤扮演）惊慌万状，这下子就把一个平常的乡下人家，变成了特殊的环境，笼罩着奇异的气氛，这是非常富于浪漫性的。逃来的青年，只因父亲岳飞遭了奸臣秦桧的谋害，逃了出来，躲在乡下人家的柜子里，这个行动是不常有的，也就是非常富有浪漫性的。他的不平常的行动，产生了不平常的订婚事件。因而使整个剧看来是个传奇剧，洋溢着浪漫主义的浓厚色彩。
    尽管母亲女儿儿子以及逃难的青年，都在这一特殊的环境中活动，都受到了离奇情节的支配，但他们都是现实中的人物，有他们自己的性格和他们自己的生活习惯。他们对付这一个不平常的事变，就是根据他们的性格和生活习惯来对付的。像刘玉莲让岳雷躲在她家，正将门关上，恰好差役赶来敲门，一面大声问：“有个相公到这里来没有？”她恐慌极了，不知如何对答。岳雷连忙向她摆手，她才向外面回答：“没，没得人来。”差役乙打冒诈地说：“我们看见他进去的！”刘玉莲慌忙向岳雷说：“哎呀，人家看见你进来的！”岳雷赶快向刘玉莲低声说：“你就说真的没有人来。”刘玉莲这才慌张向外面回答：“真，真的没有人来。”差役甲又在门外问：“你看见他跑到哪里去了？”刘玉莲只是惊慌错乱地问岳雷：“嘿，你跑到哪里去了？”岳雷低声告诉她：“你就说往西去了。”刘玉莲吓得不敢再答话了，要岳雷自己去说，到后来没奈何，只好惊慌错乱地向门外回答：“你就说——往西去了。”这一段情节，不是非常真实地把一个十六岁的小姑娘，遇见非常事件那种惊慌错乱的幼稚情景，充分表现出来了么？另外，这个小姑娘，还有泼辣的一面。当两个差役再回来敲门，而且进来搜查的时候，她就一下子扑在柜上放刁起来：“我的妈呀，这柜里装的是我们的旧衣服，不准男人家看。你们哪里是差人，明明是强盗来抢我，我跟你们拼哪。”她就拿着棍子，乱打差役，一面大喊大叫：“抢人罗，打抢人罗。”这也把乡下小姑娘，稚气而又不顾一切的泼辣性格，活生生刻划出了。这是现实主义的描写方法，但也有浪漫主义的东西存在。因为人物的动作、言语，以及表情，不是通过日常生活，而是在不平常的事件中表现出来的。从这里可以看出浪漫主义和现实主义有机地联系在一起了，其所以能有机地联系在一起，就是通过人物的性格来进行的。因为文艺的生命，起码是要富有性格的人物。戏剧本身是否生动，就靠演员把人物的性格表演得好不好。现实中的人物，都是有性格的。反转来说，人物富有性格也就富有现实性。好的演员就是能够体会人物的性格，然后根据性格去应付剧中发生的不平常的事变。他在不平常的事变中，每一动作，每一言语，每一表情，都出自他的性格，而给观众的真实感以及生活气息，自然就非常强烈了。一个戏剧的演出，能发挥出生活的气息，给观众以真实感，则故事无论怎样离奇，世间难有，也不会使人不相信的。而浪漫主义作用又在那里呢？它就是通过不平常的故事情节把人物的性格，更加突出地表现出来，产生极大的感染力，使整个剧富有光彩。
    这里可以摸出一点规律来，就是浪漫主义和现实主义的结合，首先是在掌握人物的性格，对人物的性格要有充分的了解，把人物的性格，通过动作、言语、表情，发挥在任何大小的事变中，平常的或不平常的事变中，而不失掉他的性格。我以为掌握人的性格，是不容易的。因为别个人物的性格，是作者和演员自身没有，或者具有，也是很少，必须作出多方面的研究，从人物的出身年龄生活习惯以及教养等等去观察，才能获得。而更不容易的，是让人物的性格，在自己从未经历的大小事变中去应付一切，而又要做到合情合理的地步。这是需要在各种生活中作更多的研究。演员对人物性格掌握的深不深刻，在剧情的大小事变中，应付得恰不恰当，使观众的感受是大有不同的。我们文艺工作者，的确可以从川剧中，尤其从演员身上，学习许多东西的。
