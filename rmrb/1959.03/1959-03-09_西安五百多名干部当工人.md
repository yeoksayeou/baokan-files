More than 500 leading cadres in factories and enterprises of the local industrial system in Xi'an have participated in physical labor and cultivated "experimental plots" in accordance with the relevant instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and have achieved good results.

Cadres' participation in physical labor has promptly discovered and dealt with many important issues related to production and people's lives, promoting the great leap forward in production. In October last year, the temperature in the Silico-iron workshop of the Chengfeng Flour Mill was very high. It took nearly half an hour for workers to go to the workshop to turn a screw. After the party branch secretary of the factory participated in physical labor in this workshop, he worked with the workers to study and improve the tool for turning the screw, shortening the time to turn the screw by half, which the workers were very satisfied with. The low efficiency of packaging in the packaging room of the Xi'an Textile Factory affected normal production. After the factory's Party Committee Secretary participated in physical labor in the packaging room, he discussed with the workers, factory director, engineers, and workshop director to find out the reasons and improvement methods, which promoted production.

Many leading cadres have come into contact with production practice through labor, improved their leadership level, and also worked with workers, engineering and technical personnel to study and create advanced experiences. During the forty-day hard work in the No. 6 State Cotton Factory, in order to make the 32-count yarn reach the premium grade, the factory's leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and veteran workers worked together to cultivate experimental machines, and finally spun premium yarn. Later, this experience was promoted throughout the factory, and premium yarn appeared on all 32-count yarn machines. After the Party Committee Secretary of the People's Enamel Factory cultivated "experimental plots" in the glaze powder workshop, he found that the quality of glaze powder was low and the quantity was small, falling short of demand, so he worked with the workshop's staff to study and solve this key problem. During the research, technician Zhang Shida put forward a rationalization proposal, which he immediately supported, resulting in the glaze powder's gloss increasing from 88 degrees to 128 degrees, reaching the world's advanced level.

    西安五百多名干部当工人
    本报讯　西安市地方工业系统工厂企业中有五百多名领导干部，按照中央和省、市委的有关指示，参加了体力劳动，种了“试验田”，收到了良好效果。
    干部参加体力劳动，及时发现和处理了许多有关生产和群众生活的重要问题，促进了生产大跃进。成丰面粉厂矽铁车间去年10月间温度很高，工人到车间去转动一次螺丝，需要近半个小时，厂的党总支书记在这个车间参加体力劳动以后，和工人一道研究改进了转动螺丝的工具，转动螺丝缩短了一半时间，工人非常满意。西安纺织厂打包间打包效率低，影响正常生产，厂的党委书记到打包间参加体力劳动后，和工人、厂长、工程师、车间主任一起商量，找出了原因和改进办法，促进了生产。
    不少领导干部在劳动中接触了生产实际，提高了领导水平，还和工人群众、工程技术人员一起研究，创造了先进经验。国棉六厂在奋战四十天中，为了使三十二支纱达到优级，厂的领导干部和工程技术人员、老工人一起，种了试验机台，终于纺出了优级纱，后来全厂推广了这一经验，全部三十二支纱机上都出现了优级纱。人民搪瓷厂党委书记在琅粉车间种“试验田”后，发现琅粉质低量少、供不应求，就和该车间职工一起研究解决这个关键问题；在研究中，技术员张仕达提出了合理化建议，他马上支持，结果使琅粉光泽由八十八度提高到一百二十八度，达到了世界先进水平。
