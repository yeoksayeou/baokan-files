Red Flowers Blooming Everywhere
—Selected New Folk Songs
    A Red Flower on the Construction Site
  The girl is eighteen this year,
  A red flower on the construction site.
  Full of energy,
  Enthusiasm melts the iron!
  To build the factory buildings sooner,
  Welding steel frames day and night.
  More, faster, better, and more economical, with safety,
  Not afraid of any difficulty, no matter how great!
  The welding torch turns steel into liquid,
  White light, blue, welding red glow.
  The girl smiles softly,
  Shaking off thousands of golden flowers.
    (Li Yourong, Gansu)
  Hoes Embroidering the Landscape
  In the past, girls used needles and thread,
  Sitting on the kang, embroidering the landscape,
  Now girls carry hoes and shovels,
  Embroidering the landscape with real things.
  (Tianjin Haihe Construction Site)
  Piles of stones as high as mountains,
  A group of girls carrying stones,
  Look again in an instant,
  People and stones all gone.
  (Tianjin Haihe Construction Site)
  There is…
  Entering the construction site, looking around,
  There is a young man who is truly great,
  Arms thick and round,
  Skin dark, red, and bright,
  Wearing a straw hat, simply dressed,
  Trouser legs rolled up to the knees.
  The shovel is wielded quickly and skillfully,
  Each scoop weighs dozens of pounds.
  Going forward, looking closely,
  Wondering whose good son he is.
  Looking intently, a surprise,
  Turns out to be a big girl.
  (Tianjin Haihe Construction Site)
  Women Going to the Fields
  Since ancient times, there has been a dividing line,
  Women, young and old, do not go to the fields,
  Now women have changed,
  Carrying rice and firewood with strong strength,
  Plowing, harrowing, and planting,
  Wholeheartedly for a thousand catties of grain.
          (Fenghua, Zhejiang)
  Girls Transplanting Rice Like Embroidery
  Girls transplanting rice like embroidery,
  Three seedlings per cluster, she's the one,
  Clever and skillful, planting quickly,
  A red flag following her.
      (Zhou Peizhong, Guizhou)
  This year, the enthusiasm breaks through the sky,
  Girls transplanting rice, hearts sweet,
  Everywhere forming green satin,
  Attracting the Weaver Girl to descend to earth.
  (Yang Xuanchun, Yuxi, Yunnan)
  The big ox pulls the plow,
  Women hold on tightly,
  She is a beginner,
  Several acres every day.
  (Wang Jiajia, Yuxi, Yunnan)
  Women Want to Drive Tractors
  Last year, it was still an old-fashioned plow,
  This year, replaced with new farm tools,
  Mechanization will be realized in three years,
  Women want to drive tractors.
      (Pan Qifeng, Guizhou)
  Two oxen pulling the plow as fast as the wind,
  Double-share plows turning soil as fast as a dragon,
  Who says new farm tools are heavy,
  Girls holding up the plow, faces not red.
        (Jiangkou, Guizhou)
  Busiest Than Bees Gathering Flowers
  Winding Yangding River,
  Many oak trees along the Yangding River,
  A forest of oak trees green like the sea,
  The wind blowing the leaves, laughing.
  Groups of silkworm-raising girls,
  Entering the oak forest before the rooster crows,
  Oak silkworms eating leaves like rain,
  The girls listen with more joy.
  Silkworms eat leaves, hanging on branches,
  Thousands of them on one tree,
  Wind blowing the branches, dancing in the wind,
  Like silver bells shaking all over the mountains.
  Spring light blooming, fragrance everywhere,
  Bees gathering flowers to make honey.
  Girls going back and forth in the oak forest,
  Busiest than bees gathering flowers.
        (Zhufeng, Guizhou)

    红花处处开
    ——新民歌选
    工地一朵红花
  姑娘今年十八，
  工地一朵红花。
  浑身全是干劲，
  热情叫铁熔化！
  为了厂房早建，
  昼夜焊接钢架。
  多快好省安全，
  天大困难不怕。
  焊枪点钢成水，
  白光蓝焊红霞。
  姑娘轻声一笑，
  抖落万片金花。
    （甘肃李幼容）
  扛镐绣江山
  历代姑娘弄针线，
  坐在炕上绣江山，
  现在姑娘扛镐锨，
  实地真物绣江山。
  （天津海河工地）
  片石堆得高似山，
  一群姑娘把石搬，
  霎时再到此处看，
  人和片石都不见。
  （天津海河工地）
  有个……
  进工地，举目望，
  有个小伙子真正棒，
  胳膊根子粗又圆，
  皮肤黑红亮堂堂，
  头戴草帽小打扮，
  裤腿挽到膝盖上。
  铁锨耍得快又熟，
  一锨准有几十斤强。
  走向前，仔细望，
  看是谁家的好儿郎。
  定睛瞧，吃一惊，
  原来是位大姑娘。
  （天津海河工地）
  妇女下田
  自古以来分界线，
  大小妇女不下田，
  如今妇女变了样，
  挑米打柴力量强，
  耕田耙田又种田，
  一心为了千斤粮。
          （浙江奉化）
  姑娘栽秧像绣花
  姑娘栽秧像绣花，
  三角丛植要数她，
  心灵手巧栽得快，
  一杆红旗跟着她。
      （贵州周培中）
  今年干劲冲破天，
  姑娘栽秧心里甜，
  遍地组成绿缎子，
  引动织女下凡间。
  （云南玉溪杨暄春）
  大牛拉着犁，
  妇女紧扶起，
  她是初学的，
  每天十亩几。
  （云南玉溪王家稼）
  妇女要开拖拉机
  去年还是旧式犁，
  今年换上新农具，
  三年实现机械化，
  妇女要开拖拉机。
      （贵州潘启风）
  两牛拉犁急如风，
  双铧翻土快如龙，
  谁说新式农具重，
  姑娘扶起脸不红。
        （贵州江口）
  赛过蜜蜂采花忙
  弯弯曲曲羊叮河，
  羊叮河畔柞林多，
  一片柞林绿似海，
  风吹叶儿笑呵呵。
  养蚕姑娘一群群，
  雄鸡未叫入柞林，
  柞蚕食叶声如雨，
  姑娘越听越欢欣。
  蚕儿吃叶挂树梢，
  一株树上千万条，
  风吹树枝迎风舞，
  好像银铃满山摇。
  春光开放遍地香，
  蜜蜂采花做蜜糖。
  姑娘往来柞林里，
  赛过蜜蜂采花忙。
        （贵州株丰）
