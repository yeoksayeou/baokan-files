Spring Arrives in Moscow
By Our Correspondent Li Nan

Having passed the Russian winter festival and endured the last few storms of wind and snow, the enchanting season of brilliant spring has arrived on the vast land of the Soviet Union. See, the white snow throughout Moscow has melted, the Moscow River, carrying ice floes, laps against the granite embankments, the ski and skating rinks have disappeared, and the fields have shed their thick, pure white felt, revealing patches of moist black soil, glistening in the clear sunlight.

In recent years, spring in the Soviet Union, spring in Moscow, has been late in coming, but this year it has arrived early. As early as late January and early February, during the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the sunlight streaming into the meeting hall in the Great Kremlin Palace first heralded the news of spring. More than a month ago, Muscovites began talking about this year's spring, the first spring of the comprehensive construction of communism.

Facing the spring in nature and the spring of communism on the horizon, people's hearts are blossoming, their will is high, and a force of upward leap seems to be growing from the ground. "Labor for Communism," "We are not only building communism, but also living in a communist society." Such thoughts, along with the early spring breeze, swept across the cities and villages of the entire Soviet Union.

The "Communist Labor Brigade" movement is surging forward to welcome the spring. Forty years ago, the first voluntary Saturday locomotive repair at the Moscow Railway marshalling yard is now returning to its original location from a remote region in this spring, forty years later. The older and younger generations of workers look at this locomotive and recall the glorious tradition. Now the marshalling yard is full of the vigor of spring and is very lively. More than twenty work teams are determined to strive for the lofty title of "Communist Labor Brigade." The workers said with great joy: "This spring is an extraordinary spring, it is the spring of the fortieth anniversary of the launch of the voluntary Saturday movement, it is the first spring of the communist labor competition." It was on this auspicious day of welcoming the spring that brand new diesel and electric locomotives arrived at the marshalling yard. Whenever visitors enter the building of the marshalling yard, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, Kryuchkova, will enthusiastically and generously introduce: The technology of the communist era has arrived.

In the extraordinary spring, hundreds of factories in Moscow are in full swing. In the warm spring nights, Party organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, and trade union organizations are holding meetings until late at night. The first fully automated workshop of the Moscow State Bearing Plant No. 1, the prototype of a communist-era factory, is now even more attractive to people's minds. This factory and twenty-seven other large factories in Moscow are all making a breakthrough towards full factory automation – climbing to the peak of the production level of the communist era. The secretary of the Party Committee of Bearing Plant No. 1, Kvalov, said well to the visiting guests: The first spring of the Seven-Year Plan will be busy, but also infinitely pleasant. At the very beginning of early spring, all the good omens reveal rainbow-like colors. Naturally, the weather, the surrounding environment, and people's moods all presage the imminent arrival of complete victory.

From the city center to the suburbs, the breath of early spring is even stronger. Yesterday, one could not distinguish between streams and fields, but today the streams are gurgling, and the plains are open and vast. In an instant, fertilizers have been piled up in arrays, and tractors are roaring day and night. People still remember last year's anxious anticipation of spring, although spring was half a month late, but people rushed ahead and won a bumper harvest. People called last year the "Grain Year" and this year the "Meat Year." This year, in addition to achieving a bumper harvest of grain, we must also achieve a bumper harvest of meat. Moscow City and Moscow Oblast launched a competition as soon as spring arrived, determined to double meat production.

In this spring, every Muscovite's mood is restless, and everyone is calculating what more they can do. The crowd is heading towards the northern suburbs, where the Agricultural Exhibition has not yet had time to clean up the remaining spring snow, but many pavilions of the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economic Construction have been opened ahead of schedule. In the ancient planetarium on Garden Ring Road, rockets and satellites accompany the sun, moon, and stars. Young men and women throng here all day, listening attentively to lectures on spaceflight. This is the fantasy of Soviet youth. Many factories have opened schools and scientific research institutes, and many schools have also opened factories. People's Cultural Universities have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain.

Spring in Moscow is like a colorful painting, and life is like a poem. Snowball flowers are just beginning to bloom, linden trees are waiting to sprout, the sky is azure, and the breeze is gentle. In such a good season, Muscovites are all high-spirited and full of energy, in order to live up to this memorable first spring of the comprehensive construction of communism.

### 春到莫斯科

    春到莫斯科
    本报记者　李楠
    度过了俄罗斯冬节，经过了最后的几场风雪，春光烂缦的迷人季节已来到了苏联广大的土地。看，莫斯科全城的白雪已经消融，莫斯科河夹着碎冰的水流拍击着花岗石的堤岸，各处滑雪滑冰场地已经消失，田野里褪去了纯白的厚毡，露出一片片润湿的黑土，在晴朗的阳光下闪着光彩。
    近几年来苏联的春天，莫斯科的春天都姗姗来迟，但今年却来得早。早在1月底2月初，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会期间，射进大克里姆林宫里会议大厅的阳光，首先预报了春天的消息。莫斯科人早在一个多月以前就开始谈论起今年的春天，全面展开共产主义建设的第一个春天了。
    面对着自然界的春天和共产主义在望的春天，人们心花怒放，意志高扬，像平地滋生了一股向上跃进的力量。“为共产主义而劳动”，“我们不仅建设共产主义，而且要在共产主义社会中生活。”这样的思想随着早来的春风，吹遍了全苏联的城市和乡村。
    “共产主义劳动队”运动迎接着春天澎湃起来了。四十年前莫斯科铁路机车编组站第一个义务星期六修理的机车，在这四十年后的春天又从遥远的地区返回了原地。老一代和新一代的工人们看着这部机车想起了光荣的传统。现在编组站里春意勃勃，热闹非常。二十几个工作队立志要争取到“共产主义劳动队”的崇高称号。工人们兴高采烈地说：“今年这个春天是个不平凡的春天，这是发起义务星期六运动满了四十年的春天，这是共产主义劳动竞赛的第一个春天”。正是在这个迎春的佳日，一辆辆崭新的内燃机车和电气机车开来了编组站。每逢来访者走进编组站的大楼，党委会副书记克留齐科娃就会热情豪放地介绍：共产主义时代的技术来到了。
    在不平凡的春天里，莫斯科的数以百计的工厂里正在热火朝天。在温暖的春夜，党组织、共青团组织、职工会的组织都在召开会议，直到深夜。莫斯科国家第一轴承工厂的第一个完全自动化车间，这个共产主义时代工厂的雏型，现在更加吸引着人们的心灵。这家工厂和莫斯科其他二十七家大型工厂都在朝着全厂自动化——攀登共产主义时代生产水平的高峰突进。第一轴承厂党委书记克瓦洛夫对访问的客人说得好：七年计划的第一个春天将是忙碌的，同时也是无限愉快的。在初春刚开始的时候，一切美好的预兆都显露出彩虹般的色彩。自然，天气，四周的环境，人们的心情，都预示着完满的胜利即将来到。
    从市中心到市郊，初春的气息更加浓郁。昨天还分不清溪流和田野，今天溪涧已经流水淙淙，平野已经胸怀坦露。转瞬间，肥料已堆成阵，拖拉机日夜轰鸣。人们还记得去年焦急盼春光，虽然春天迟来半月，但是人们赶在前面，争取了大丰收。人们把去年叫做“粮食年”，把今年叫成“肉类年”。今年除了要使粮食大丰收外，还要使肉类大丰收。莫斯科市和莫斯科州一入春就掀起了竞赛，下决心要把肉类生产加一番。
    在这个春天里，每一个莫斯科人的心情都是不平静的，人人在计算着多作些什么。人群向着北郊走去，那里农业展览会还来不及打扫完残留的春雪，但国民经济建设成就展览会的许多展览馆已提前开放。花园环道上古老的天象馆里火箭、卫星随伴着日月星辰，这里整天拥挤着青年男女，谛听关于宇宙飞行的讲演，这是苏维埃青年人的幻想。许多工厂开办了学校和科学研究所，许多学校也办起了工厂。人民文化大学像雨后春笋一样出现了。
    春天的莫斯科景色像一幅彩画，生活像一首诗篇。雪球花刚刚开放，菩提树等待发芽，天色蔚蓝，微风和畅。在这样大好的季节里，莫斯科人都意气风发，干劲饱满，为了不辜负这个可纪念的全面展开共产主义建设的第一个春天。
