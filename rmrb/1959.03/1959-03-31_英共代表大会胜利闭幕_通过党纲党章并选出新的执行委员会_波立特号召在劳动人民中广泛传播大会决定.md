    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th: The 26th Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain concluded here today in an atmosphere of confidence and renewed enthusiasm.

    Party Chairman Pollitt, amidst thunderous applause, delivered the closing remarks, saying, "Our congress is not yet a congress of builders of communism, but we have shown that our congress is a congress of people who deeply believe and know that one day we will be builders of communism."

    During the four-day congress, ninety-four delegates spoke. They discussed the political report of General Secretary Gollan, the report of Lochlann on the party's aims and constitution, who is responsible for organizational work, the report of London District Secretary and Executive Committee member John Mahon on the rules of procedure, and some resolutions of the party district committees and branch organizations.

    Twenty-five fraternal delegates from communist and workers' parties in eighteen countries attended the congress and read out congratulatory telegrams and letters guaranteeing international solidarity.

    The congress also adopted the party's aims and constitution put forward by the Executive Committee.

    The congress elected a new Executive Committee composed of forty-two members. They included Pollitt, Gollan, Gallacher, Todd, Campbell, Lochlann, Matthews, Klugmann, Wainwright, Frank Haxell, Arnold Kettle, and Nora Jeffrey. Today, at the closing ceremony, when the new committee members walked onto the stage to take their seats, they were greeted with thunderous applause.

    In his closing speech, Pollitt called on the participants of the congress to disseminate the decisions made at the congress most widely among the working people. He said that the political report made at the congress and the political resolutions adopted put forward a very clear political line, which will become the basis of the work of the entire party in the near future. He said, "All our comrades now have a clear understanding of the economic situation in Britain, a clear understanding of how to effectively combat the trends leading to recession, how to strengthen the struggle to safeguard peace, and, very importantly, how to do more work to try to accelerate the united action of all sections of the working people, in order to be in the best possible position to defeat the efforts of the employers and the Conservative government to resolve the capitalist crisis at the expense of the working class."

    Pollitt then said, "The congress has issued a call to action to all parts of the workers' movement, calling on them in particular to unite all the forces that can be united in order to ensure a decisive defeat for the Conservatives in any possible general election, and to re-elect a Labour government that guarantees a policy of peace and progress, a Labour government that will be supported by a Labour majority in Parliament and strengthened by the re-entry of some Communist members of Parliament."

    He pointed out that the congress paid great attention to strengthening the party organization. He also called for strengthening work among women and young people and expanding the circulation of the "Daily Worker" and other party newspapers and periodicals.

    Pollitt turned to the representatives of the fraternal parties and said: "We were encouraged by the speeches of the representatives of eighteen fraternal parties, who brought their parties' congratulations to our congress. We have also received congratulatory telegrams from another eleven fraternal parties. We can be sure that these congratulatory telegrams have strengthened the ties of peace and friendship between all our peoples, and they have also deepened our own understanding and practice of proletarian internationalism."

    Pollitt said: "We are very happy and proud to be able to welcome so many fraternal party representatives to our congress and to receive so many congratulatory telegrams."

    He announced amidst applause: "Our congress and party have also been inspired and encouraged by the recently concluded victorious 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. That congress undoubtedly marked a new moment in world history."

    "We are deeply convinced that the Soviet Union's magnificent 1959-1965 Seven-Year Plan, which has now begun to be implemented, will promote the transformation of the world, and are deeply convinced that the great example it has shown to its own people will be followed by the whole world, especially by China and all socialist democracies, as well as by capitalist countries."

    Pollitt finally announced the closing of the congress and shouted "Long live world peace, long live the Communist Party and the 'Daily Worker', long live communism." At this time, all the delegates stood up and applauded and cheered for a long time. The congress ended with everyone singing The Internationale.

    英共代表大会胜利闭幕
    通过党纲党章并选出新的执行委员会
    波立特号召在劳动人民中广泛传播大会决定
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国共产党第二十六次代表大会今天在充满信心和新的热情的气氛中在这里闭幕。
    党的主席波立特在暴风雨般的掌声中致闭幕词说，“我们的大会还不是共产主义建设者的代表大会，但是我们已经表明，我们的大会是深信和知道有一天我们将是共产主义建设者的人的代表大会。”
    在历时四天的代表大会期间，有九十四位代表发言。他们讨论了总书记高兰的政治报告、负责组织工作的劳奇林关于党的宗旨和党章的报告、伦敦区书记、执行委员会委员约翰·马洪关于议事规则的报告以及党区委员会和支部组织的一些决议。
    来自十八个国家的共产党和工人党的二十五位兄弟代表出席了代表大会，并且在会上宣读了保证国际团结的贺电和贺信。
    代表大会还通过了执行委员会所提出的党的宗旨和党章。
    大会选出了由四十二名委员组成的新执行委员会。他们包括波立特、高兰、加拉赫、杜德、坎贝尔、洛赫冷、马修斯、克卢格曼、温莱特、弗兰克·哈克塞耳、阿诺德·克特耳和诺拉·杰弗里。今天在闭幕式上，当新的委员会委员们走上讲台就座时，受到暴风雨般掌声的欢迎。
    波立特在发表闭幕演说时号召大会的参加者把大会作出的决定最广泛地传播到劳动人民中去。他说，在大会上所作的政治报告和通过的政治决议提出了一个非常清楚的政治路线，这将成为在最近的将来整个党的工作的基础。他说，“我们所有的同志现在已清楚地了解英国的经济状况，清楚地了解怎样有效地来同导向衰退的趋势斗争，怎样加强维护和平的斗争，而且非常重要的是，怎样做更多的工作来设法加速促成劳动人民的各个部分的一致行动，以便居于最优越的地位来击败雇主和保守党政府设法靠牺牲工人阶级来解救资本主义危机的努力。”
    波立特接着说，“大会特别向工人运动的各个部分发出了一个发动攻击的动员号召，号召它们特别要团结起所有能够团结起来的力量，以便在可能举行的任何大选中保证使保守党遭到决定性的失败，再选出一个保证实行和平和进步政策的工党政府，这个工党政府将得到议会中的工党大多数的支持，并且由于一些共产党议员重新进入议会而加强它的地位。”
    他指出，代表大会对于加强党组织给了极大的注意。他还号召加强在妇女和青年当中的工作和扩大“工人日报”和党的其它报刊的发行数量。
    波立特转向兄弟党的代表说：“我们受到了十八位兄弟党代表发言的鼓舞，他们带来了他们的党对我们代表大会的贺词。我们还收到了另外十一个兄弟党的贺电。我们可以肯定，这些贺电加强了我们全体人民之间的和平和友谊的联系，它们还加深了我们自己对无产阶级国际主义的了解和实践。”
    波立特说：“我们对能够欢迎这样多的兄弟党代表出席我们的代表大会和收到这么多的贺电，感到非常高兴和自豪。”
    他在掌声中宣布：“我们的代表大会和党还受到最近召开的胜利的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的鼓舞和砥励。那次大会无疑标志着世界历史中的新的时刻。”
    “我们深信，现在已经开始执行的苏联的宏伟的1959—1965年七年计划，将促进世界的变革，并且深信，它在自己的人民面前展示的伟大榜样，将为全世界特别是中国和所有社会主义民主国家以及资本主义国家所效法。”
    波立特最后宣布代表大会闭幕，并高呼“世界和平万岁，共产党和‘工人日报’万岁，共产主义万岁。”这时全体代表起立，经久不息地鼓掌和欢呼。代表大会在全体高唱国际歌声中结束。
