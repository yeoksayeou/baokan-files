    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: The Japan Socialist Party, Communist Party, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and fourteen other political parties and organizations held a representative meeting in Tokyo today and decided to establish a joint struggle organization of people from all walks of life nationwide on March 28—the "National Conference to Prevent Revision and Strive for Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."
    The meeting also called on Japanese organizations and individuals from all walks of life to participate in this organization.
    The representative meeting decided to actively prepare for a high tide in the movement to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on April 15.
    Last autumn, the Japanese people formed the "National Conference Against the Revision of the Police Duties Execution Law," with approximately 500 organizations and 10 million participants from all walks of life, and launched a powerful joint struggle that thwarted the then-Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law." Now, the Japanese people have decided to establish a national conference to strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to realize a joint struggle including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.
    The fourteen organizations participating in today's meeting also include: the Federation of Independent Unions, the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases, the National Federation of Farmers' Associations of Japan, the All-Japan Joint Struggle Conference of Youth and Students, the Women's Association for the Protection of National Human Rights, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy.
