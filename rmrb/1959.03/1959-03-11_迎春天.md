    Welcoming Spring
    Worker of Wuhan Iron and Steel, Wang Weizhou
    Wuhan Iron and Steel hasn't experienced winter's cold,
    Wuhan Iron and Steel has always been in the company of spring,
    When winter approached, a patch of peach blossoms bloomed—
    The molten iron of No. 1 Blast Furnace illuminated the sky red.
    Guo Lao described the smoke as black peony,
    Now it blooms all over the sky of Wuhan Iron and Steel.
    Tower cranes are waving their arms,
    Remotely calling for the swallows that are late for spring.
    Hot blast stoves also raise their necks to sing battle songs,
    They call out to the newly built blast furnaces and steel mills:
    "Dear, dear brothers!
    It's spring, hurry up, fighting partners!"
    In previous years, spring first turned green in the suburbs,
    This year, spring comes to the workshop first,
    The hundred thousand heroes of Wuhan Iron and Steel are on their warhorses,
    Waving sweat-drenched arms to welcome spring.

    迎春天
    武钢工人　王维洲
    武钢没有经过冬寒，
    武钢一直和春天作伴，
    临冬时开放了桃花一片——
    一号高炉的铁水照红了天。
    郭老形容烟是黑牡丹，
    如今在武钢的天空开满。
    塔式吊车在挥起臂膀，
    遥唤着来迟了的春燕。
    热风炉也仰着脖子唱战歌，
    它把新建的高炉和炼钢厂呼唤：
    “亲爱的，亲爱的兄弟们！
    春天了，快起来呀，战斗的伙伴！”
    往年的春天先从郊外绿，
    今年的春天却先来到车间，
    武钢的十万健儿上了战马，
    挥着汗淋淋的臂膀迎接春天。
