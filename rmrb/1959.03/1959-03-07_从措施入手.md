Title: Starting with Measures

The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province is launching a high-yield, and even higher-yield, movement to produce 1,000 catties of grain per mu. When deploying this battle, the Jinbei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party revised the plan by starting with grasping measures, and finally focused on implementing various measures, making a big deal of measures, and putting forward the slogan "Seek high yield from measures, and guarantee high yield with measures." This is an important issue with universal significance at present.

Any production task needs to be completed by people, and people must go through certain measures when completing the task. Measures are not only the means to complete the task, but also the basis for proposing indicators. Therefore, when people weigh whether a production task can be completed, they usually first look at whether the measures taken are appropriate and complete. Appropriate and complete measures are not only a guarantee for completing the task, but also can promote and generate advanced ideas and advanced indicators. The fact that measures and indicators rose together in the practice of the Great Leap Forward in the Yanbei area of the Jinbei Special District last year is the best example. Some people were skeptical when this low-yield area, whose historical total output had never exceeded 800 million catties, proposed the slogan "Breaking through the 1 billion catties mark" at the beginning of last year. The original Yanbei District Committee organized cadres and farmers to visit and "learn from experience" in Henan, and formulated twelve yield-increasing measures for the Jin Queen corn and ten methods to ensure the bumper harvest of yam. With the measures catching up, the indicators jumped to 1.3 billion catties at once, and people were full of confidence in this task. Later, they summarized the experience of strengthening late-stage management of summer crops and widely promoted it in the field management of autumn crops. After the three new measures of topdressing, watering, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests were taken on the vast majority of farmland in the district, the district's total grain output target jumped again to 1.8 billion catties. As a result of grasping measures throughout the year, the final total grain output reached 2.1 billion catties.

Measures and enthusiasm are also complementary. With effective measures, people have a place to use their abilities, work skillfully, work smoothly, and their enthusiasm will become greater and greater. And greater and greater enthusiasm can ensure the realization of measures, enrich measures, and formulate new and more effective measures. On the contrary, if there are only large indicators and the measures are generalized, and there is "steel" (enthusiasm) but it is not used on the "blade" (the most appropriate place), the result is that one achieves half the result with twice the effort, and enthusiasm will also be frustrated.

1959 is a year of even greater leap forward. The tasks are greater than last year, and more abundant and powerful measures are needed than last year. Grasping one more point of measures will add one more guarantee for achieving greater indicators. Therefore, this year, in leading the great leap forward in agricultural production, we should not only grasp measures and formulate plans, so that the plans are fully advanced and reliable, but also grasp the measures to realize the measures to increase production. Divide the crops, divide the seasons, distinguish between the priorities and the urgency, grasp in a planned way, from preparing for sowing to harvesting, grasp from beginning to end, and carry it through to the end. The practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 has proved that wherever the measures are grasped in a timely manner, grasped appropriately, grasped tightly, grasped skillfully, grasped meticulously, and grasped completely, there the high-yield targets can be achieved. The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province continuously grasped measures in a big way last year, and the result was that it ended the low-yield situation in history and jumped into the ranks of high-yield areas at once. This year, at the beginning of the new year of the greater leap forward, they have put forward the slogan of "Seek high yield from measures, and guarantee high yield with measures" in the high-yield and higher-yield movement launched throughout the district. They are doing the right thing, doing a good job, and it is worth learning from everyone. (Attached picture)

Under the leadership of the Party and the hard work of the breeders, the "March 8th" Youth Pig Farm in Changdian Commune, Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, has gained some good experience in the management, feeding, breeding, epidemic prevention and fattening of live pigs. These experiences were promoted at the on-site meeting held here in January this year. This is the pigsty of the pig farm.

### 从措施入手

    从措施入手
    山西省晋北专区正在掀起一个亩产千斤粮的高产再高产运动。中共晋北地委在部署这次战斗的时候，从抓措施入手修订计划，最后落脚到贯彻执行各项措施，在措施上大作文章，提出“向措施要高产，用措施保高产”的行动口号。这是当前有普遍意义的一个重要问题。
    无论什么生产任务都需要人来完成，而人在完成任务的时候又必须通过一定的措施。措施不仅是完成任务的手段，而且是提出指标的根据。因此，人们权衡生产任务能不能完成的时候，通常是先看所采取的措施是否得当，是否完满。得当的、完满的措施，不仅是完成任务的保证，而且还能够促进和产生先进的思想和先进的指标。晋北专区雁北地区在去年大跃进的实践过程中，措施和指标水涨船高的事实，就是一个最好的例证。这个历史上总产量没有突破八亿斤的低产区，去年年初提出“突破十亿斤大关”的口号的时候，有些人是抱着怀疑态度的。原雁北地委组织干部、农民到河南参观、“取经”，制订了金皇后玉米十二项增产措施和保证山药蛋丰收的十项办法。措施赶上去了，指标一下子就跃到十三亿斤，而人们却对这项任务满怀信心。后来他们又总结了夏收作物加强后期管理的经验，在大秋作物田间管理中普遍推广。在全区绝大部分农田上采取了追肥、追水、防治病虫害三项新措施以后，全区的粮食总产量指标再跃为十八亿斤。全年抓措施的结果，最后粮食总产量达到了二十一亿斤。
    措施和干劲也有着相辅相成的关系。措施得力，人有用武之地，干得巧、干得得心应手，干劲就越来越大。而越来越大的干劲，又能保证实现措施、充实措施、制定新的更得力的措施。相反，空有大指标，措施一般化，有“钢”（干劲）用不在“刀刃”（最恰当的地方）上，事倍功半，干劲也会受到挫折。
    1959年是更大跃进的一年。任务比去年大了，需要有比去年更丰富更有力的措施。多抓一分措施，就会为实现更大指标增加一分保证。因此，今年在领导农业生产大跃进中，不仅应该抓措施、订计划，使计划充分先进可靠，同时还要抓实现增产措施的措施。分作物、分季节、分别轻重缓急，有计划地抓，从准备播种到丰收，从头抓到尾，一竿子插到底。1958年大跃进的实践已经证明：哪里的措施抓得及时，抓得得当，抓得紧，抓得巧，抓得细，抓得全，那里就能实现高产的指标。山西省晋北专区去年不断地大抓措施，其结果是结束了有史以来的低产局面，一下子跃入了高产区的行列。今年，在更大跃进的新年度之初，他们在全区掀起的高产再高产运动中，又提出了“向措施要高产，用措施保高产”的行动口号。他们做得对，做得好，值得大家学习。（附图片）
    辽宁省宽甸县长甸公社“三八”青年养猪场，在党的领导和饲养员们刻苦努力下，对生猪的管理、饲养、繁殖、防疫及催肥等方面都获得了一些好经验。这些经验在今年一月全县在这里召开的现场会议上，得到了推广。这是养猪场的猪圈。
