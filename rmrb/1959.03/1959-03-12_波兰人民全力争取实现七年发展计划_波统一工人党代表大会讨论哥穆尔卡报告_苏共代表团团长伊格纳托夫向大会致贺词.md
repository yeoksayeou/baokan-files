Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 11th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued at 10:00 AM on the 11th.

The morning session was chaired by Ochab, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

The congress first heard the work report of the Central Auditing Commission delivered by Stachacz, Chairman of the Central Auditing Commission. In his report, he said that educating party members to improve their discipline and awareness is one of the regular tasks of the party's auditing commission. He pointed out that auditing commissions at all levels have achieved considerable success in their work.

Next, Ignar, Chairman of the Supreme Committee of the Polish United Peasants' Party, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the United Peasants' Party. He pointed out that in the worker-peasant alliance, the working class plays a leading role. The Polish United Workers' Party plays a leading role in the Polish worker-peasant alliance. He also said that in Poland, the worker-peasant alliance is embodied through the activities of the Polish United Workers' Party in the countryside and its cooperation with the United Peasants' Party. There are no differences between the United Peasants' Party and the United Workers' Party. The United Workers' Party plays a huge role in the development of the country. The United Peasants' Party stands on a socialist position.

Subsequently, Kulczyński, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party, congratulated the congress on behalf of the Democratic Party. He said that the Democratic Party believes that the seven-year development plan proposed by the United Workers' Party is correct. The task of the Democratic Party is to encourage intellectuals and small property owners to actively participate in socialist construction. The Democratic Party will continue to cooperate with the United Workers' Party and recognize the leading role of the United Workers' Party. He said that only socialism can guarantee Poland's independence and the prosperity of science and culture.

After Ignar and Kulczyński delivered their congratulatory messages, the congress began to discuss the summary report of the work of the Party Central Committee.

The first to speak in the discussion was Gierek, Secretary of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party and First Secretary of the Katowice Provincial Committee. He said that the party's activities since the Eighth Plenary Session have proven the correctness of the party's policies, the unparalleled vitality of the socialist system, and that Marxism-Leninism is a vital and immortal doctrine.

Gierek said that under the leadership of the party, more and more people are participating in socialist construction. These facts show that all the claims of the revisionists are wrong, and that dogmatism is also harmful. Our party is more mature at the time of the Third Congress. We have not failed the expectations of the people. Gierek pointed out that since the Eighth Plenary Session, the party has strengthened its unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The reactionary forces' attempts to undermine our unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have failed, and all conspiracies to alienate Poland from the first socialist country—the Soviet Union—are doomed to failure. Poland is a member of the socialist family and will not leave the socialist camp.

Gierek emphasized that the 120,000 party members in Katowice Province fully support the party's correct line. The workers and party cadres throughout the province fully support the seven-year development plan formulated by the party. Workers put forward more than 20,000 suggestions during the discussion of the 1959-1965 Polish development instructions and took many measures to tap the production potential of enterprises.

The next speaker was Kraśko, First Secretary of the Poznań Provincial Committee. He talked about the economic development achievements of Poznań Province and its position in the national economy, and also talked about the great changes in Polish life in recent years.

Kraśko then described to the congress the great determination of the Poznań workers to complete the future development plan. He said that the agriculture and animal husbandry in our province are relatively advanced in the country, but the industry is relatively weak. We will never let our province's industry lag behind other provinces and must catch up.

Koźdra, First Secretary of the Lublin Provincial Committee, said in his speech that the Lublin Provincial Party Delegation believes that Gomulka's evaluation of the past in his report is correct. Although Lublin Province inherited the party's revolutionary tradition, the right-wing forces were also relatively large. Without the correct leadership of the party and the party's prestige among the masses, work would be very difficult.

Koźdra then talked about the province's production gifts to the party's "Third Congress." He said that more than 30 factories throughout the province are now preparing to realize the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Agricultural collectivization in our province is moving forward. We fully agree with our country's new development plan and will do our best to implement the resolutions passed by this congress.

Also speaking at the morning session today were Janina, Chairman of the Women's League of Łódź Province, and worker representative Strzokowska.

The head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Ignatov, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress at the morning meeting today. When Ignatov walked to the podium, the audience stood up and applauded warmly. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Khrushchev, he congratulated the congress. At this time, thunderous and prolonged applause rang out again.

In his congratulatory message, Ignatov said that every step taken by People's Poland on the road to socialism is a contribution to strengthening the socialist system. He said that the Soviet Union and you are brothers as close as hands and feet, and we are together at all times. The enemies of socialism have attempted to undermine Soviet-Polish unity, and their attempts have failed.

Finally, Ignatov read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congratulatory telegram was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

The morning session ended here, and the meeting will continue at 4:00 PM. (Attached picture)

    波兰人民全力争取实现七年发展计划
    波统一工人党代表大会讨论哥穆尔卡报告
    苏共代表团团长伊格纳托夫向大会致贺词
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会11日上午十时继续举行。
    上午会议由波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员奥哈布担任执行主席。
    大会首先听取了党中央检查委员会主席斯塔哈奇作的中央检查委员会的工作报告。他在报告中说，教育党员提高纪律性和觉悟程度是党的检查委员会经常的工作之一。他指出，各级检查委员会在工作中都取得了不少成绩。
    接着，波兰统一农民党最高委员会主席伊格纳尔代表统一农民党向大会致贺词。他指出，在工农联盟中，工人阶级起着领导作用。波兰统一工人党在波兰工农联盟中起着领导作用。他又说，在波兰，工农联盟是通过波兰统一工人党在农村的活动和它与统一农民党的合作来体现的。统一农民党和统一工人党之间不存在任何分歧。统一工人党对国家的发展起着巨大的作用。统一农民党站在社会主义立场上。
    随后，波兰民主党中央委员会主席团主席库耳钦斯基代表民主党向大会祝贺。他说，民主党认为，统一工人党提出的七年发展计划是正确的。民主党的任务是使知识分子和小有产者积极参加社会主义建设。民主党将继续同统一工人党合作，承认统一工人党的领导作用。他说，只有社会主义才能保证波兰的独立和科学、文化的繁荣。
    在伊格纳尔和库耳钦斯基致贺词之后，大会开始讨论党中央委员会的工作总结报告。
    在讨论中第一个发言的是统一工人党中央委员会书记、卡托维兹省委员会第一书记格雷克。他说，党在八中全会以后的活动证明了党的政策的正确，证明了社会主义制度具有无比的生命力，证明了马克思列宁主义是富有生命力的、不朽的学说。
    格雷克说，在党的领导下，参加社会主义建设的群众愈来愈多了。这些事实说明，修正主义者的全部主张都是错误的，也说明了教条主义也是有害的。我们党在召开第三次代表大会的时候是更加成熟了。我们没有辜负人民的期望。格雷克指出，八中全会以后，党加强了同苏联以及其它社会主义国家的团结。反动势力想破坏我们同苏联和其他社会主义国家的团结的企图是破灭了，所有想离间波兰同第一个社会主义国家——苏联的团结的阴谋注定是要破产的。波兰是社会主义大家庭的一员，它是不会离开社会主义阵营的。
    格雷克强调说，卡托维兹省的十二万党员完全支持党的正确路线。全省的工人和党的干部完全支持党制订的七年发展计划。工人们在讨论1959——1965年波兰发展指示的过程中提出了二万多条建议，并采取了许多挖掘企业生产潜力的措施。
    接着发言的是波兹南省委员会第一书记克腊希科。他谈到了波兹南省的经济的发展成就及其在全国经济生活中的地位，还谈到了最近几年来波兰生活的巨大变化。
    克腊希科接着向大会叙述了波兹南工人对完成今后发展计划的巨大的决心。他说，我们省的农业和畜牧业在全国是比较先进的，但是工业相当薄弱。我们绝不让我们省的工业落在其他省的后面，必须迎头赶上。
    卢布林省委员会第一书记科兹德腊发言说，卢布林省党代表团认为，哥穆尔卡在报告中对过去的估价是正确的。卢布林省虽然继承了党的革命传统，但右派势力也较大。如果没有党的正确领导和党在群众中的威信，工作是很困难的。
    科兹德腊接着谈到了这个省对党的“三大”的生产献礼。他说，现在，全省已有三十多个工厂准备提前实现五年计划。我们省的农业合作化正在向前发展。我们完全同意我国的新的发展计划，并将尽全力实现这次代表大会通过的决议。
    在今天上午会议上发言的还有罗兹省妇女联盟主席亚尼娜和工人代表斯特若科夫斯卡。
    苏联共产党代表团团长、苏共中央主席团委员伊格纳托夫在今天上午的会议上向大会致了贺词。当伊格纳托夫走向讲台时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。他代表苏联共产党中央委员会和赫鲁晓夫同志向大会祝贺，这时，全场又响起了雷动般的、长时间的掌声。
    伊格纳托夫在贺词中说，人民波兰在社会主义道路上所走的每一步，都是对加强社会主义体系的贡献。他说，苏联同你们是情同手足的兄弟，不论在任何时候，我们都是在一起的。社会主义的敌人企图破坏苏波团结，他们的企图遭到了失败。
    伊格纳托夫最后宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会的贺电。这封贺电受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    上午会议至此结束，下午四时，会议将继续进行。（附图片）
