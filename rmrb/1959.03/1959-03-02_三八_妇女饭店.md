"March 8th" Women's Restaurant
By Our Correspondent

    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, with hard work and ingenuity, miracles are happening in every field. Here, a machine is created to mechanize what was originally done by hand; there, a component is installed on a machine to make it highly efficient and automated. But can machines replace manual operations in the frequently visited restaurants? Recently, a restaurant has emerged on the bustling Jingyu Street in Harbin that uses machines for almost everything, from cutting vegetables, steaming buns, and making dumplings to serving food to customers. This is the "March 8th" Restaurant, run by dozens of women.
    Anything new is bound to arouse people's interest. Because of this, the restaurant is constantly filled with people eating, visiting, and inquiring. With a sense of novelty, the reporter also came to this restaurant.
    Have you seen the "aerial acrobat" performance by acrobatic troupes? But I believe you have not seen "aerial flying vegetables." This wonderful show appears in the restaurant. The restaurant is no different from others. The waiters, dressed in white uniforms and hats, greet customers warmly and enthusiastically, serving tea and water. But when you finish ordering and before you finish your cup of tea, you hear a "hissing" sound from the ceiling. Looking up, you see a circular wooden box sliding rapidly along a special track on the ceiling. When it slides to a place near the table, the two floating white dust covers of the wooden box slowly open, revealing hot, fragrant dishes inside. The restaurant calls this gadget the "aerial sliding food delivery machine." It is much faster than waiters running back and forth through the crowd to deliver food. Sometimes the dishes are delivered to the table with the "crackling" sound of freshly fried food. Some old customers who know the inside story enthusiastically introduce to people that this is not the most novel thing; if you go into the kitchen to take a look, there are even more novel gadgets.
    As a customer, the reporter exceptionally entered the restaurant's kitchen. Upon entering, we couldn't help but admire and praise! This is nothing like a kitchen. From the stove to the tableware, from the ceiling to the cement floor, everything is so clean. Chefs and staff in clean clothes are working in an orderly manner by the stoves and machines, the sound of knives and spoons ringing out evenly and rhythmically, much like a sophisticated food laboratory.
    A female chef named Ban Cuixia is cooking next to the universal stove. This universal stove has one coal inlet and four burners for cooking. Because it reduces the number of smoke and ash-dropping stove mouths, it is not as dirty as ordinary coal stoves. In addition, the white tiles on the stove top, carefully wiped by the female chefs, appear exceptionally clean. This universal stove also has a steam pack, which is connected to a universal steamer, two large pots, and a steam sterilizer. Steaming buns, cooking dumplings, and stir-frying can be done simultaneously. In addition, used tableware can be sterilized using steam.
    In this restaurant, almost all heavy and tedious manual labor is replaced by machines. There is a noodle-dredging machine for scooping noodles, a meat-slicing machine for cutting shredded and sliced meat, a meat grinder for mincing dumpling filling, and machines for cutting vegetables, washing vegetables, and even the very complex work of making dumplings. There are more than thirty kinds of these machines. This is of great help in reducing physical labor and improving work efficiency. The aerial sliding food delivery machine alone saves waiters from walking forty to fifty miles a day delivering food.
    The "March 8th" Restaurant is run by ordinary women. None of them had been chefs before, let alone engaged in business management. Some were even women who had just left their families. But none of this stumped them. With their soaring enthusiasm for serving society, they quickly mastered the techniques of cooking and preparing meals. But what worried them was another problem: In this era of the Great Leap Forward, when one day equals twenty years, every guest who comes to eat wants to finish quickly so they can do more work for socialism. Therefore, in the past, when manual operation was used, customers would ask "How fast?" as soon as they entered. Some impatient people would sit for a while, become impatient, and get up and leave. At first, they thought it was their service attitude that was not good, so they told customers stories, sang songs, and wanted to reduce the customers' impatience, but this did not fundamentally solve the problem. What to do? At this time, the party branch secretary, Zhang Shurong, told them: "People are making technical revolutions and mechanization. You should also focus on this aspect, wouldn't it improve the efficiency of cooking?" Now everyone's mind brightened up. A broad but arduous road unfolded before them.
    In their spare time after work every day, regardless of the fatigue of the day, they went out to study and visit, seek teachers and friends, learn from fraternal restaurants, and visit various exhibitions. They imitated what they saw that was suitable, and created from what they were inspired by. I talked to Luan Guihua about her creation of the noodle-dredging machine. She started working here in August last year and was responsible for cooking noodles. Because many customers ate noodles, each pot had to cook more than twenty pounds. In this way, problems occurred when scooping noodles: because there were many noodles and it took a long time to scoop them, the first noodles scooped were only 80% cooked, and the later noodles were overcooked. Moreover, scooping noodles was tiring and caused backaches and arm pains. In order to solve this problem, Luan Guihua and everyone else worked hard to research in the great technical revolution movement. They brainstormed together, and after repeated research and improvement, they finally created a pulley crane noodle-dredging machine that looked like a simple crane. This noodle-dredging machine saves labor, reduces physical labor, and is extremely easy to operate. It uses a pulley car to hang a pot-shaped sieve. When cooking noodles, the sieve is submerged in the pot. When the noodles are cooked, the crane is rocked to lift the sieve, and all the noodles are scooped out at once. They also imitated the foot-operated rice thresher to manufacture a vegetable-leaf-beating machine. The greens that need to have their leaves removed are placed on it, and they are cleaned in the blink of an eye.
    Perhaps some people will doubt that doing this must cost a lot of money. In fact, the "March 8th" Women's Restaurant, because the staff use their brains to find solutions, the machines they manufacture are both money-saving and applicable. The restaurant has now installed thirty-two kinds of machinery and equipment.
    The "March 8th" Women's Restaurant has won widespread praise from customers. Many customers say: "Eating at the March 8th Restaurant is fast, good, and comfortable. If you have something urgent, sit down and eat, and go to do your business when you're done, it won't delay you at all."
    These female warriors who have won a great victory on the technical revolution battlefield are now preparing for a new battle. Liu Chunzhen, who has just returned from visiting Beijing and Tianjin, said: They will implement automation in ordering food and meals. After the waiter asks the guest what they want to eat, they press the button according to their pre-arranged number, just like sending a telegram, and the kitchen will prepare the food and send it from the air with the aerial sliding food delivery machine. By then, their wishes of "no need to speak when ordering food, no need to carry when serving food, no need to walk when delivering food" will all be realized.

    “三八”妇女饭店
    本报记者
    在大跃进的年代里，苦干加巧干，行行出奇迹：这里创造一种什么机器，把原来手工操作机械化了；那里又在机器上装置一个什么部件，就能使它变成了高效率的自动化。可是，在人们常来常往的饭店能不能用机械代替手工操作呢？最近，在哈尔滨繁华的靖宇大街上却出现了这样一家饭店，它从切菜、蒸馒头、包饺子到给客人送饭菜等，几乎全部是用机械。这就是由几十名妇女经营的“三八”饭店。
    大凡一件新的事物，都会引起人们的兴趣。正因为这样，这家饭店每天往来吃饭、参观、访问的人，川流不息。记者也怀着新奇的心情，来到这家饭店。
    你们看过杂技团表演的“空中飞人”吧？但我相信你们没有看过“空中飞菜”。这个精彩的节目却出现在这家饭店的餐厅里。这个饭店的餐厅和别家没什么两样，穿戴着洁白衣帽的服务员，殷勤而又热情地接待顾客，送茶倒水。但当你点完了菜，一杯热茶还没有喝完，只听得天花板上发出“咝咝”的响声，仰脸观看，只见一个圆形的木盒沿着顶棚特制的轨道迅速地滑行着。当滑行到临近餐桌的地方，木盒的两扇浮白色防尘盖缓缓张开，里边盛着热腾腾香喷喷的菜。饭店把这个玩艺叫“空中滑行送菜机”。它比服务员在人群中跑来跑去送菜要快得多，有时菜送到桌上盘里刚烹炸出来的菜还发出“卡巴、卡巴”的声音。有些知道底细的老顾客，兴致勃勃地向人们介绍，这还不算新奇，如果到厨房里看看，新奇的玩艺更多了。
    记者作为一个顾客，破例的走进了饭店的厨房。一进门就使我们钦羡和赞叹不止！这里哪像是厨房呢？从灶台到餐具，从天棚到水泥地面，到处是那样干净。衣衫洁白的厨师和工作人员，在灶台上，在机器旁，有条不紊地工作着，刀勺响出均匀而有节奏的声音，倒很像一个讲究的食品化验室。
    一位名叫班翠霞的女厨师正在万能灶旁炒菜。这个万能灶是一个灶口进煤，四个火口上架勺作菜，因为减少了燎烟落灰的灶口，所以它不像一般煤灶那样脏。再加上灶台上砌的雪白瓷砖，经过了女厨师细心拂拭，显得异常干净清洁。这个万能灶还有个蒸汽包，它连带着万能蒸屉、两口大锅和一个蒸汽消毒器，蒸馒头、煮饺子和炒菜可以同时进行。另外，用过的餐具，还可以利用蒸汽消毒。
    在这家饭店里，几乎所有的笨重的和繁琐的体力劳动都由机械来代替了。捞面条用的捞面机、切肉丝和肉片用的切肉机，剁饺子馅用的绞肉机，切菜、洗菜，甚至于很复杂的包饺子的工作，也由机器来代替。这些机器，不下三十多种。这对减轻体力劳动和提高工作效率有很大作用。仅空中滑行送菜机一项，就使服务员免去每天来回送菜饭走的四、五十里路程。
    经营这家“三八”饭店的，都是些平凡的妇女。她们之中过去没有人作过厨师，更没有人搞过经营管理，有的甚至还是刚离开家庭的妇女。但这些都没有难住她们，就凭她们那种为社会服务的冲天干劲很快就掌握了烹饪作饭的技术。但使她们苦闷的却是另外一个问题：在这一天等于二十年的大跃进年代里，每个来吃饭的客人，都想争取时间快些吃完，好为社会主义多干些工作。因此，在过去用手工操作的时候，顾客一进门就问“快不快？”有些性急的人坐一会儿，等得不耐烦了，起身就走了。开头，她们还以为是自己的服务态度不好，于是给客人说快板、唱歌子，想以此来减少客人的急躁心情，但是，还不能从根本上解决问题。怎么办？这时党支部书记张树荣告诉他们说：“人家都在大闹技术革命，搞机械化，你们也应该在这方面打主意，不就会使作饭作菜的效率提高了吗？”这下大家的心里亮堂了，一条宽广但又很艰巨的道路，在她们眼前展开了。
    在每天下班后的业余时间里，她们不顾一天的疲劳，四出学习参观，求师访友，到兄弟饭店学习，到各种展览会上参观；看到适用的就模仿，受点启发的就创造。我和栾桂华谈了她创造捞面机的过程。她是去年8月到这里工作的，当时负责煮面，因为客人吃面多，每锅要煮二十多斤。这样，在捞面时就发生了问题：因为面多捞的时间长，先捞的面条八分熟，后捞的面就煮烂了，而且在捞面时还累得腰酸臂疼。为了解决这个问题，栾桂华和大家一起在大闹技术革命运动里苦苦地钻研开了。她们一同想办法，经过反复研究、改进，终于创造出来一个状如简易起重机似的滑轮吊车捞面机。这个捞面机，节省人力，减轻体力劳动，并且操作极为简便。它利用滑轮车，吊着一个锅形的大筛子，煮面时把筛子沉进锅里去，煮熟了摇动吊车往上吊筛子，一筛子面条一次就全部捞出来了。她们还仿照脚蹬打稻机制造一台打菜叶机，把需要打掉叶子的青菜往上一搭，转眼之间打得精光。
    或许有人会怀疑像她们这样做，一定要花很多钱，其实“三八”妇女饭店因为工作人员动脑筋想办法，她们所制造的机器，都是既省钱又适用。现在这个饭店已安装了三十二种机器设备。
    “三八”妇女饭店获得了顾客们广泛的好评。许多客人说：“在三八饭店吃饭，又快又好又舒服。如果你有什么急事，坐下就吃，吃完去办事，一点也不耽误。”
    这些在技术革命战场上打了个大胜仗的女战士们，现在又在准备一个新的战役。刚从北京、天津参观回来的刘纯珍说：她们将要在叫菜叫饭方面实行自动化。服务员问过客人想吃什么之后，按照自己编好的号码，就像发电报似的按下电钮，厨房就会把饭菜准备好，并且用空中滑行送菜机从空中送来。到那时候，她们的“叫饭叫菜不用口，端饭端菜不用手，送饭送菜不用走”的愿望，就全部实现了。（附图片）
