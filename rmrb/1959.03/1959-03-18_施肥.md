Fertilization
Fertilizer Division, Land Utilization Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

    In 1958, high-yield fields in various regions created many new fertilization experiences, broke through many conventions, innovated fertilization techniques, and obtained a series of high-yield fertilization experiences. Here, based on some incomplete information we have regarding the high-yield fertilization experiences of rice, winter wheat, and cotton, we have made a preliminary compilation and analysis to provide a brief introduction for your reference.

                  More Fertilizer, More Production

    In the past, it was believed that excessive fertilizer would cause crops to grow excessively lush, leading to lodging and reduced production. Therefore, people generally did not dare to apply large amounts of fertilizer, applying only one or two thousand catties per mu, which limited the yield of grain and cotton to the level of tens or hundreds of catties per mu for a long time, and created some so-called "low-yield" crops (such as wheat). In 1958, on the basis of deep plowing and close planting, various regions applied tens of thousands of catties of fertilizer per mu, creating many examples of large-area yields of more than a thousand catties of grain and more than a hundred catties of ginned cotton per mu. The experience of agricultural bumper harvests completely shattered the conservative view of some people who believed that "too much fertilizer will reduce production," and proved that with the correct coordination of various agricultural technical measures, increasing the application of fertilizer in large quantities will not cause a reduction in production, but on the contrary, is a major condition for promoting agricultural bumper harvests.

    According to survey data from various regions, the fertilization rates for high-yield fields of crops such as rice, winter wheat, and cotton in 1958 were roughly as follows:

    Rice:

    In Jiangsu Province, early rice yielded 1,000 catties per mu, and each mu applied more than 100 dan of fertilizer (including farm manure and chemical fertilizer converted to pig manure); a yield of 3,000 catties per mu applied about 200 dan of fertilizer; and a yield of 5,000 catties per mu applied more than 300 dan of fertilizer. In Zhejiang Province, early rice yielded about 2,000 catties per mu, and each mu applied an equivalent of more than 150 dan of pig manure. In Huangpi County, Hubei Province, middle rice yielded 2,120 catties per mu, and each mu applied an equivalent of 150 dan of pig manure. A survey of 27 high-yield middle rice fields in Wu'an Township, Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, showed that for yields above 1,000 catties per mu, the average fertilizer application (converted to pig manure) was about 142 dan; for yields of 2,000 to 3,000 catties per mu, the application was 225 dan; and for yields of 4,000 to 5,000 catties per mu, the application was 337 dan. A survey of 18 high-yield single-season late rice fields in Dongfeng Commune, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, showed that for yields of 1,000 to 1,500 catties per mu, the fertilizer application (converted to pig manure) was about 109 dan; for yields of 1,500 to 2,000 catties per mu, the application was about 142 dan; for yields of 2,000 to 3,000 catties per mu, the application was 175 dan; and for yields of 3,000 to 4,000 catties per mu, the application was 210 dan. In Yongji and Yanbian, Jilin Province, yields were around 1,000 catties per mu, with about 10,000 catties of soil manure applied. In Yingkou and Shenyang, Liaoning Province, yields were above 1,000 catties per mu, with more than 10,000 catties of soil manure applied. From these materials, it appears that a rice yield of 1,000 catties per mu generally requires a fertilizer application (equivalent to pig manure) of about 100 dan or about 10,000 catties of soil manure; a yield of 2,000 catties per mu requires about 150 dan of fertilizer; a yield of 3,000 catties per mu requires about 200 dan of fertilizer; and a yield of 5,000 catties per mu requires more than 300 dan of fertilizer.

    Winter Wheat:

    From the analysis and estimation of fertilization data from nearly 100 high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties per mu in various regions, the approximate content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium three elements in the fertilizer applied is: an average yield of 1,300 catties per mu requires about 76 catties of nitrogen, 85 catties of phosphorus, and 160 catties of potassium; an average yield of 2,350 catties per mu requires about 111 catties of nitrogen, 119 catties of phosphorus, and 225 catties of potassium; an average yield of 3,480 catties per mu requires about 127 catties of nitrogen, 146 catties of phosphorus, and 259 catties of potassium; an average yield of 4,350 catties per mu requires about 160 catties of nitrogen, 186 catties of phosphorus, and 377 catties of potassium. Comprehensive analysis of these materials suggests that a wheat yield of 1,000 catties per mu requires about 40 to 60 catties of nitrogen, 40 to 60 catties of phosphorus, and 80 to 120 catties of potassium. According to experience in various regions, with the correct coordination of various agricultural techniques, generally applying 20,000 to 30,000 catties of coarse manure and 30 to 50 catties of chemical fertilizer per mu can achieve a yield of more than 1,000 catties.

    Cotton:

    In the Botouji Joint Team of the Hucun People's Commune, Puyang County, Henan Province, the approximate content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the fertilizer applied to 380 mu of cotton fields is: for an average yield of more than 300 catties of ginned cotton per mu, the application was 34 catties of nitrogen, 23 catties of phosphorus, and 38 catties of potassium; for a yield of more than 500 catties of ginned cotton per mu, the application was 50 catties of nitrogen, 31 catties of phosphorus, and 52 catties of potassium; and for a yield of more than 1,100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, the application was 94 catties of nitrogen, 69 catties of phosphorus, and 79 catties of potassium. The experience of many high-yield fields has proven that under the correct fertilization techniques and the coordination of other agricultural techniques, applying about 40 catties of pure nitrogen per mu, combined with corresponding phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, can achieve a yield of 1,000 catties of seed cotton. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences applied 8,000 catties of stable manure per mu as basal fertilizer, and additionally topdressed with 1,000 catties of human manure, 100 catties of horse manure, 30 catties of ammonium sulfate, and 34 catties of superphosphate, for a total fertilizer content of 35.3 catties of nitrogen, 32.3 catties of phosphorus, and 34.9 catties of potassium, achieving a yield of 1,067 catties of seed cotton per mu.

    From the above data, it can be clearly seen that the relationship between crop yield and fertilizer application is that the higher the crop yield per unit area, the more fertilizer is applied. Therefore, to increase crop yield per unit area, it is necessary to increase fertilizer application accordingly. At the same time, measures such as deep plowing, rational close planting, rational irrigation, selection of improved varieties, and rational fertilization should also be adopted to improve fertilizer efficiency and reduce waste. In short, comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" can more effectively exert the yield-increasing effect of fertilizer.

              Rational Combination of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium

    Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the main nutrient elements necessary for crop growth and development. Their functions are different and cannot be substituted for each other. The lack of any one will affect the normal growth of crops. Therefore, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium must be rationally combined to meet the needs of crop growth and development.

    In the past, it was believed that Chinese soils generally lacked nitrogen, the Yangtze River Basin and its southern regions were relatively deficient in phosphorus, and potassium was generally not lacking. The yield-increasing effect of applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers was very poor or ineffective. Therefore, in fertilization measures, general emphasis was placed only on increasing nitrogen fertilizer, while neglecting phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The high-yield field bumper harvest experience of 1958 in various regions proved that while greatly increasing nitrogen fertilizer application, combining with increasing phosphorus and potassium fertilizer application has a significant effect on increasing yield. For example, the results of cotton experiments at the Xiangyang Experimental Station in Hubei Province showed that increasing pure nitrogen by 6 catties per mu increased production by 23.21%; pure phosphorus by 6 catties increased production by 6.56%; and pure potassium by 6 catties increased production by 3.65%. The combined yield increase effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium applied separately was 33.42%. While nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium each 6 catties applied in combination increased production by 51.37%. The yield increase of combined application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was 28.16% higher than that of single application of nitrogen fertilizer. This fully proves that rational combination of the three elements, especially increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, can greatly increase crop yield. In high-yield situations, crops not only need a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer, but also need a large amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. The phosphorus and potassium nutrients that can be supplied by general soils are far from meeting the needs of high crop yields. Therefore, while greatly increasing nitrogen fertilizer application, it is necessary to pay attention to increasing phosphorus and potassium fertilizer application.

    The combination ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is not fixed. It is closely related to soil conditions, crop types, and yield. Different soils, different crops, and different yields require different combination ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilization. According to some preliminary observation materials from Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, for a rice yield of 500 catties per mu, the comprehensive application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is 3:1:2; for a rice yield of 1,200 catties per mu, the comprehensive application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is 1:1:1.5. From the analysis and estimation of fertilization data from nearly 100 high-yield wheat fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties per mu in various regions, the comprehensive application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is approximately 1:1:2. According to the analysis and estimation of fertilization data from more than 30,000 mu of high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu in thirteen provinces, the comprehensive nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization ratio is roughly 1:1:1.

                  Apply Sufficient Basal Fertilizer

    The experience of the agricultural bumper harvest in 1958 proves that applying sufficient basal fertilizer is a basic link to ensure the normal and robust growth of crops, prevent lodging, and obtain a bumper harvest. Generally speaking, basal fertilizer should be more important than topdressing. The appropriate ratio of basal fertilizer to topdressing varies depending on the crop.

    Rice:

    According to the data from the 1958 National Rice Bumper Harvest Science and Technology Exchange Conference, in the Yangtze River Basin, double-season early rice has a short growing period, and basal fertilizer should account for about 80% of the total fertilizer application, while topdressing accounts for about 20%; double-season late rice has high temperatures in the early growth stage and fertilizer decomposes quickly, basal fertilizer should account for 70%-80%, and topdressing accounts for 30%-20%; single-season late rice has a long growing period, basal fertilizer should account for about 60%, and topdressing accounts for about 40%. For medium-maturing varieties in the north and the Yangtze River Basin, basal fertilizer should account for 70%-80% of the total fertilizer application, and topdressing accounts for 30%-20%. In South China, with high temperatures and heavy rainfall, fertilizer decomposes quickly, basal fertilizer for double-season early rice should account for about 70% of the total fertilizer application, and topdressing accounts for about 30%; basal fertilizer for double-season late rice should account for about 60%, and topdressing accounts for about 40%.

    Winter Wheat:

    From the analysis of fertilization data from nearly 100 high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties per mu, the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients contained in the basal fertilizer account for 46%-49% of the total fertilizer application, topdressing before winter accounts for 31%-35%, and topdressing after winter accounts for 18%-20%. Among them, the basal fertilizer, especially phosphorus and potassium nutrients, of many high-yield fields accounts for more than 50%. Generally speaking, basal fertilizer should be more important than topdressing, and topdressing before winter should be more important than topdressing after winter.

    Cotton:

    According to the analysis of fertilization data from more than 30,000 mu of high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu in thirteen provinces, the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients contained in the basal fertilizer roughly account for 70%-80% of the total fertilizer application, and topdressing accounts for 30%-20%.

    Too little basal fertilizer and too much topdressing, especially too much topdressing in the later stage, can easily cause crops to grow excessively lush stems and leaves, delayed ripening, weak stalks, leading to lodging and reduced production. For example, in Hongqiao Cooperative, Penglang Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, one field of middle rice had a basal fertilizer application accounting for only 37.5% of the total fertilizer application, while topdressing accounted for 62.5%. As a result, heading was delayed by one week compared to the middle rice planted at the same time, all of them lodged after heading, and the percentage of unfilled grains was as high as 60%, with a yield of only 500 catties per mu. Another field of middle rice had a basal fertilizer application accounting for 67.1% of the total fertilizer application, while topdressing accounted for 32.9%. As a result, the rice seedlings grew normally, with many panicles, uniform heading, and a yield as high as 4,508 catties per mu. In the seventh team of Yuetan Cooperative, Yanshi County, Henan Province, the wheat seed field, calculated according to the nitrogen content in the fertilizer applied, only 24.4% was in the basal fertilizer, 16.5% in the winter fertilizer, and 59.1% in the spring fertilizer, and most of them lodged during the heading stage, seriously affecting the yield.

    Basal fertilizer is mainly applied with slow-release organic fertilizers, and some quick-acting fertilizers are appropriately applied to combine slow-acting and quick-acting effects. Combined with deep plowing, it is evenly applied in layers to integrate fertilizer and soil and ripen the soil. Slow-release fertilizers are applied in the lower layer to allow sufficient time for full decomposition and slow release, continuously supplying the needs of the entire crop growth process. Quick-acting fertilizers are applied in the upper layer to timely supply the nutritional needs of crop seedlings, making them grow vigorously. The experience of layering fertilization in paddy fields in the Chengdu Plain of Sichuan is: first sprinkle part of the mud fertilizer, compost, green manure, and stable manure on the field surface and turn it into the bottom layer; then sprinkle the remaining basal fertilizer on the plow sole for shallow plowing; then pour human and animal manure on the plowed plow sole, then irrigate the field and harrow, and apply a small amount of manure or ammonium sulfate as topdressing before transplanting seedlings.

    The yield increase effect of layering fertilization is very significant. For example, in Hongqiao Cooperative, Penglang Township, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, there were two paddy fields with the same planting density, variety, soil quality, stubble, and basal fertilizer quantity. One field adopted the method of layering fertilization, and the yield of rice was 1,188 catties per mu, which was 32% higher than the yield of 900 catties per mu in the other field where all the basal fertilizer was applied in the lower layer without topdressing. In Qianjiang County, Hubei Province, on the same section of land deeply plowed to 1.8 feet to plant cotton, applying the same amount of fertilizer, layering fertilization increased production by 71.98% compared with not layering fertilization.

                Topdressing in Stages

    The 1958 agricultural bumper harvest fertilization experience proves that to obtain high yields of crops, it is not only necessary to apply sufficient basal fertilizer, but also to pay special attention to topdressing in the later stage of crop growth. This is an important link to strive for long and large ears of rice and wheat, many and full grains, many and large cotton bolls, increase yield and improve quality. Topdressing should be carried out in multiple stages at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts according to the fertilizer needs of different growth and development stages of crops. It is necessary to ensure that the fertility does not run out to meet the continuous needs of crop growth and development; at the same time, it is also necessary to avoid excessive concentration of fertility, which will affect the normal growth and development of crops and cause adverse consequences.

    Rice:

    The 1958 rice bumper harvest fertilization experience is: on the basis of applying sufficient basal fertilizer, topdressing early, applying panicle fertilizer, and supplementing grain fertilizer. Topdressing for early and middle rice should be early to promote early growth and development of seedlings. The experience in Hunan Province is that ash manure or chemical fertilizer is generally topdressed immediately after transplanting. The experience in high-yield fields in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other places is to topdress about one week after transplanting seedlings. After that, watch the seedlings and promote them. Single-season late rice generally starts topdressing in the early stage of tillering. According to the experience in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, topdressing for single-season late rice should master the principle of "light in the front (tillering fertilizer), heavy in the middle (panicle fertilizer), and sufficient in the rear (grain fertilizer)." The amount of fertilizer applied in the early stage of tillering should account for about 10% of the total fertilizer application, the amount applied during the young panicle differentiation and booting stage should account for about 25%, and the amount applied before and after heading should account for about 5%.

    Applying panicle fertilizer during the young panicle differentiation stage of rice can promote large panicles and many grains, and the yield increase effect is significant. The prototype of the panicle begins to form at this stage, and the number of branches and branchlets in the future panicle and the number of grains that each branch and branchlet will bear are determined. After this, only the grains can be filled, and the number of grains cannot be increased. Scientific research has proven that the young panicle differentiation stage is the stage with the highest nutrient absorption rate in the entire rice growth process, that is, the stage with the most urgent nutrient requirements. Therefore, whether the nutrition during this period is sufficient has a decisive significance for rice yield. Under sufficient nutrition, the number of panicle branches and flowers can be increased, promoting large panicles and many grains; at the same time, it can prevent the death of some late and weak tillers due to insufficient nutrition, increasing the number of effective panicles. Conversely, under nutrient deficiency, tillers will die in large numbers, reducing the number of panicles; at the same time, it will affect the differentiation of panicle branches, reduce the number of spikelets, and reduce the seed setting rate of spikelets, making panicles small and grains few. The time to apply panicle fertilizer can generally be about one month before the normal heading period. Panicle fertilizer should be applied with quick-acting phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers.

    About half a month before the heading of rice, during the differentiation stage of pistils and stamens, young panicles and glumes develop simultaneously, requiring a lot of nutrients. If the nutrition is insufficient at this time, the glumes will degenerate in large numbers, increasing the number of unfilled grains. Therefore, appropriately topdressing with quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer at this time can help the development of glumes, reduce unfilled grains, and increase yield. This topdressing is called grain fertilizer, which is what farmers call strengthening tail fertilizer. According to the experience in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, the yield of rice per mu with grain fertilizer applied to single-season late japonica rice is 200 to 300 catties higher than that without application. Applying quick-acting phosphorus and potassium fertilizer during the flowering and grain filling stage of rice can promote the grains to grow strong and full.

    In the past, the application of panicle fertilizer and grain fertilizer to rice was not common, especially in early and middle rice. It was generally believed that early and middle rice have a short growing period. As long as sufficient basal fertilizer is applied once and topdressing is applied early, tillering will stop and the situation has become a certainty. Further topdressing will delay maturity or cause lodging hazards. For late rice, it was generally believed that after the formation of young panicles, nothing could be done, and further topdressing would not only have little effect, but also easily cause rice to grow excessively lush and lodge. The experience of rice bumper harvests in various regions in 1958 proves that regardless of early, middle, or late rice, correctly applying panicle fertilizer and grain fertilizer will not cause "danger" and can increase yield. This broke the old view of applying panicle fertilizer and grain fertilizer in the past.

    Winter Wheat:

    The experience of wheat bumper harvests in various regions in 1958 shows that wheat fertilization should achieve a continuous promotion effect of "laying the foundation, attacking the roots, attacking the seedlings, attacking the stubble, attacking the panicles, and attacking the grains." On the basis of applying sufficient basal fertilizer and applying seed fertilizer, topdressing should be carried out in multiple stages according to the needs of different growth stages of seedlings, plants, panicles, and grains. Many high-yield fields have created fertilization experiences such as "five fertilizers and six waters," "six fertilizers and eight waters," and "nine fertilizers and ten waters," breaking the previous misconception that wheat cannot be fertilized too much, and too much fertilizer will cause wheat to grow excessively lush and cause lodging.

    In winter, tillering fertilizer and wax fertilizer (also called rooting fertilizer) should be applied to promote and consolidate tillering before winter, which is an important link in striving for high-yield wheat bumper harvests. Because winter tillers of wheat have a long growth and development time and have their own independent root system, the root system develops well, the ability to absorb nutrients and water is strong, and the growth is vigorous. They are mostly effective tillers. Spring tillers, due to late development, weak root system, and poor ability to absorb nutrients and water, are prone to death and become ineffective tillers. About one month after the emergence of wheat seedlings, when the wheat seedlings begin to tiller, applying quick-acting fertilizer as tillering fertilizer (called full moon fertilizer by farmers) can promote vigorous tillering of wheat seedlings and increase tillering before winter. Before overwintering, organic fertilizers such as pen manure and corral manure should be applied as wax fertilizer to increase soil temperature and protect wheat seedlings to overwinter safely; at the same time, it can supply the nutrients needed by wheat seedlings to consolidate tillering before winter and increase the effective tillering rate.

    In the past, there was a wrong saying about wheat that "autumn is prosperous and spring is not prosperous," saying that: "Autumn seedlings are one foot high, and the ground is bare in spring; autumn seedlings are two or three inches, and the ground is covered in spring." Therefore, some places did not dare to apply topdressing before winter for wheat fields, fearing that if the fertilizer was sufficient before winter, the wheat would be tender and not resistant to freezing, and the returning green in spring would be weak. The fertilization experience of the satellite field in Zhuotou Cooperative, Anguo County, Hebei Province, which yielded 5,103 catties of wheat per mu in 1958, applied sufficient topdressing before winter to promote vigorous growth of wheat seedlings, many tillers, reaching 1.3 million plants per mu; applying pen manure to cover wheat during overwintering to keep warm and prevent freezing. Generally, the above-ground leaves of wheat seedlings are all frozen to death, while the satellite field only freezes two-thirds dry. Returning green in spring is early, and recovery is fast. After returning green, topdressing and irrigation are frequent. Due to sufficient fertilizer and water, 1.19 million plants of tillers before winter were preserved, reaching 91% of the total number of tillers. Facts have proven that under sufficient fertilizer and water and strengthened field management, tillers before winter can safely overwinter. At the same time, the experience of high-yield wheat fields in 1958 proves that wheat not only needs topdressing before winter, but also topdressing before winter should be more important than topdressing after winter.

    In spring, during the returning green, jointing, booting, and grain filling stages of wheat, topdressing is needed, and quick-acting nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers should be increased. In early spring, when wheat seedlings return green, due to the long-term low-temperature environment in winter, the activity of microorganisms in the soil is weak, the decomposition of nutrients in the soil is small, and quick-acting nutrients are lacking. But at this time, it is also the main period for wheat seedlings to become vigorous and the wheat ears to form, and the young ears begin to differentiate, requiring rapid absorption of a large amount of nutrients. Topdressing with returning green fertilizer at this time can not only consolidate tillering before winter, promote spring tillering, and increase the effective tillering rate, increasing the number of panicles, but also increase the number of spikelets and spikelet flowers, promoting large and long panicles. Therefore, this topdressing is very important. This topdressing should mainly use quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer, combined with the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Topdressing during the jointing and booting stages of wheat can increase the seed setting rate of spikelets, reduce the number of infertile spikelet flowers, and promote large panicles and many grains. During this period, it is necessary to apply quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer to meet the needs of booting and flowering, and also to combine with the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to promote thick and strong stalks that are not easy to lodge. During the flowering and grain filling stage of wheat, some quick-acting fertilizers, especially phosphorus fertilizer, should be appropriately topdressed to promote full and strong grains and increase yield.

    In the past, local habits generally stopped fertilizing and managing wheat after jointing, believing that: "When wheat is up, it is not effective to apply manure." The wheat bumper harvest experience in various regions in 1958 broke this convention, proving that strengthening the late fertilization and management of wheat is an important link in striving for a greater bumper harvest.

    Cotton:

    The experience of cotton bumper harvests in various regions in 1958 is to adopt the method of applying less fertilizer in the seedling stage, applying more in the middle stage, and applying an appropriate amount in the later stage on the basis of applying sufficient basal fertilizer; at the same time, in terms of fertilizer types, appropriately apply more phosphorus fertilizer and less nitrogen fertilizer for topdressing in the seedling stage; when the lower cotton bolls are firmly seated during the flowering stage, apply more nitrogen fertilizer in stages; topdressing with nitrogen fertilizer and phosphorus fertilizer as boll fertilizer during the boll setting stage. This fertilization can promote the normal development of cotton seedlings, control excessive growth, and early boll setting. Sufficient nutrition in the middle stage and no fertilizer deficiency in the later stage can effectively reduce bud and boll shedding and promote many, large, and stable cotton bolls. The experience in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, is: the amount of fertilizer applied in the seedling stage accounts for about 10% of the total amount of topdressing, the amount applied in the bud and flowering stage accounts for about 60%, and the amount applied in the boll setting and boll opening stage accounts for about 30%. Many high-yield cotton fields in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other places have changed the habit of applying more nitrogen fertilizer in the early stage and adopted the method of applying heavy phosphorus fertilizer and light nitrogen fertilizer in the early stage, emphasizing both nitrogen and phosphorus in the middle stage, and applying heavy nitrogen fertilizer in the later stage, which has a significant yield increase effect.

    In the past, cotton was generally topdressed only during the seedling, budding, and flowering stages, that is, topdressing was limited to the early and middle stages of cotton growth, and fertilization was no longer carried out after the flowering stage. It was generally believed that cotton topdressing should not be later than mid-July, otherwise it would cause cotton to grow excessively lush, delaying maturity. Therefore, the negative argument that "flowers at the end of summer do not go home" and "everything is over after the beginning of autumn" was widely spread.

    The experience of 1958 overturned this convention, proving that appropriate topdressing in the later stage of cotton growth will not only cause excessive growth, but also have a significant effect on striving for more autumn bolls, increasing boll weight, and reducing late bud and boll shedding. For example, the results of the comparison between applying boll fertilizer and not applying boll fertilizer in Xinchang Cooperative, Shimen County, Hunan Province, showed that after thirty-five days of application, the average total number of bolls per mu increased by 18,543. According to a survey in Fengzhuang, Huojia County, Henan Province, on the same land and with the same cultivation management, the yield of seed cotton per mu with 30 catties of ammonium sulfate applied as boll fertilizer was 82 catties higher than that without application. Cotton has a long late growth time. From flowering and boll setting to boll opening, it lasts for more than two months. During this period, cotton still needs a large supply of nutrients. If the nutrition is insufficient at this time, the growth of cotton will be restricted, and the cotton bolls will either fall off or develop poorly, thus affecting the yield and quality of cotton. In the past, fertilization was stopped after cotton flowering, often causing insufficient nutrition in the later stage, making the cotton plants yellow and weak, and the upper part grew only fruit branches without forming bolls. Therefore, appropriately topdressing during the boll setting and boll opening stage of cotton to meet the needs of cotton in the later stage of growth can promote vigorous growth, making the summer bolls grow large and the autumn bolls grow more and larger. This is an important measure to promote cotton yield increase.

    农业部土地利用局肥料处
    1958年，各地高产田创造出许多新的施肥经验，冲破了很多陈规，革新了施肥技术，获得一系列的高产的施肥经验。这里，根据我们所掌握的有关水稻、冬小麦和棉花高产施肥经验一些不完整的资料，初步整理分析，作一简单介绍，供大家参考。
                  多施肥多增产
    以往认为，肥多会使农作物贪青徒长，引起倒伏，招致减产。因此，一般不敢大量施肥，每亩只施肥一、二千斤，使得粮食和棉花的亩产量长期局限在几十斤、几百斤的水平，并造成了有些所谓“低产”作物（如小麦）。1958年，各地在深耕、密植的基础上，每亩施肥几万斤，创造出许多大面积亩产千斤以上粮食、百斤以上皮棉的丰产事例。农业丰产经验完全打破了有些人认为“肥多要减产”的保守观点，证明了在各项农业技术措施正确的配合下，大量增施肥料，非但不会造成减产，恰恰相反，正是促进农业丰产的一个主要条件。
    根据各地的调查资料，1958年水稻、冬小麦、棉花等作物高产田的施肥量大致如下：
    水稻：
    江苏省早稻亩产一千斤，每亩施肥料（包括农家肥料和化学肥料折合猪厩肥）一百担以上；亩产三千斤，施肥二百担左右；亩产五千斤，施肥三百担以上。浙江省早稻亩产二千斤左右，每亩施肥量相当于猪厩肥一百五十担以上。湖北省黄陂县中稻亩产二千一百二十斤，每亩施肥量相当于猪厩肥一百五十担。江苏省高邮县武安乡二十七块中稻高产田调查：亩产一千斤以上，平均亩施肥料（折合猪厩肥）约一百四十二担；亩产二千斤到三千斤，施肥二百二十五担；亩产四千到五千斤，施肥三百三十七担。江苏省松江县东风社十八块单季晚稻高产田调查：亩产一千到一千五百斤，施肥（折合猪厩肥）约一百零九担；亩产一千五百到二千斤，施肥约一百四十二担；亩产二千到三千斤，施肥一百七十五担；亩产三千到四千斤，施肥二百一十担。吉林省永吉、延边等地，亩产一千斤左右，施土粪肥一万斤左右。辽宁省营口、沈阳等地，亩产一千斤以上，施土粪肥一万斤以上。从这些材料看来，水稻亩产一千斤，一般施肥量（相当于猪厩肥）一百担左右或土粪肥一万斤左右；亩产二千斤，施肥一百五十担左右；亩产三千斤，施肥二百担左右；亩产五千斤，施肥三百担以上。
    冬小麦：
    从各地近百个亩产千斤以上的高产田施肥资料分析估算，所施用肥料中氮、磷、钾三要素含量的大致情况是：平均亩产一千三百斤，约施用氮七十六斤，磷八十五斤，钾一百六十斤；平均亩产二千三百五十斤，约施用氮一百一十一斤，磷一百一十九斤，钾二百二十五斤；平均亩产三千四百八十斤，约施用氮一百二十七斤，磷一百四十六斤，钾二百五十九斤；平均亩产四千三百五十斤，约施用氮一百六十斤，磷一百八十六斤，钾三百七十七斤。综合这些材料看来，小麦亩产一千斤，约需施用氮四十斤到六十斤、磷四十斤到六十斤、钾八十斤到一百二十斤。各地经验，在各项农业技术正确的配合下，一般每亩施用粗肥二、三万斤，并施用三、五十斤化学肥料，可以获得千斤以上的产量。
    棉花：
    河南省濮阳县胡村人民公社波头集联队，三百八十亩棉田施用肥料中氮、磷、钾三要素含量大致是：平均亩产皮棉三百斤以上的，施用氮三十四斤、磷二十三斤、钾三十八斤；亩产皮棉五百斤以上的，施用氮五十斤、磷三十一斤、钾五十二斤；亩产皮棉一千一百斤以上的，施用氮九十四斤、磷六十九斤、钾七十九斤。许多丰产田经验证明，在正确的施肥技术和其他农业技术的配合下，每亩施用纯氮四十斤左右，配合相应的磷、钾肥料，可以获得千斤籽棉的产量。例如，山西省农业科学研究所，每亩施用厩肥八千斤作基肥，另外追施人粪尿一千斤，马粪一百斤，硫酸铵三十斤，过磷酸钙三十四斤，合计肥料中含氮三十五点三斤，磷三十二点三斤，钾三十四点九斤，获得了亩产一千零六十七斤籽棉的产量。
    从上述的资料可以明显地看出，农作物产量与施肥量的关系是，农作物单位面积产量愈高，施肥量愈多。因此，要提高农作物单位面积产量，必须相应地增施肥料。同时，也要采取深耕、合理密植、合理灌溉、选用良种以及合理施肥等等措施，以提高肥效，减少浪费。总之，全面地贯彻“八字宪法”才能更有效地发挥肥料的增产作用。
              合理配合施用氮、磷、钾
    氮、磷、钾是农作物生长发育所必需的主要营养元素。它们的作用各有不同，不能相互代替，缺少那一种，都将影响作物的正常生育。因此，氮、磷、钾必须合理配合，以适应农作物生长发育的需要。
    过去认为，我国土壤普遍缺乏氮素，长江流域及其南部地区较缺磷，钾素一般不缺，施用磷、钾肥料的增产效果甚差或无效。因此，在施肥措施上，一般只着重增施氮肥，而忽视磷肥和钾肥。1958年各地高产田丰产经验证明，在大量增施氮肥的同时，配合增施磷、钾肥料，对增产有显著效果。例如，湖北省襄阳试验站棉花试验结果：每亩增施纯氮六斤的，增产23.21％；纯磷六斤的，增产6.56％；纯钾六斤的，增产3.65％。综合氮、磷、钾分别施用的增产效果共为33.42％。而氮、磷、钾各六斤配合施用的增产51.37％。配合增施磷、钾肥料较单施氮肥的增产28.16％。这就充分证明，合理配合三要素，尤其是增施磷、钾肥料，可以大大增加作物产量。在高产的情况下，农作物不仅需要大量的氮肥，而且也需要大量的磷肥和钾肥，一般土壤中能供给的磷、钾养分，远不能满足作物高产的需要。因此，在大量增施氮肥的同时，必须注意增施磷、钾肥料。
    氮、磷、钾的配合比例不是一成不变的，它与土壤情况和农作物种类、产量是密切相关的。不同的土壤、不同的作物、不同的产量，要求施肥中氮、磷、钾的配合比例是有所不同的。根据河北省天津专区一些初步的观察材料，水稻亩产五百斤，综合施用氮、磷、钾的比例是3∶1∶2；水稻亩产一千二百斤，综合施用氮、磷、钾的比例是1∶1∶1.5。从各地近百个亩产一千斤以上小麦高产田的施肥资料分析估算，综合施用氮、磷、钾的比例约为1∶1∶2。根据十三个省三万多亩亩产一千斤以上籽棉的高产田施肥资料分析估算，综合氮、磷、钾的施肥比例大致是1∶1∶1。
                  施足基肥
    1958年农业丰产的经验证明，施足基肥是保证作物生育正常健壮，防止倒伏，获得丰产的一个基本环节。一般说，基肥应重于追肥。基肥和追肥的适当比例，因作物而不同。
    水稻：
    根据1958年全国水稻丰产科学技术交流会议的资料，长江流域，双季早稻生长期短，基肥宜占总施肥量的80％左右，追肥占20％左右；双季晚稻生长前期气温高，肥料分解快，基肥宜占70％—80％，追肥占30％—20％；单季晚稻，生长期长，基肥宜占60％左右，追肥占40％左右。北方及长江流域的中熟品种，基肥宜占总施肥量的70％—80％，追肥占30％—20％。华南地区高温多雨，肥料分解快，双季早稻基肥宜占总施肥量的70％左右，追肥占30％左右；双季晚稻基肥宜占60％左右，追肥占40％左右。
    冬小麦：
    从近百个亩产千斤以上高产田的施肥资料分析，基肥中所含氮、磷、钾养分占总施肥量的46％—49％，冬前追肥占31％—35％，冬后追肥占18％—20％。其中不少高产田的基肥，特别是磷、钾养分，占50％以上。一般说，基肥宜重于追肥，冬前追肥宜重于冬后追肥。
    棉花：
    根据十三个省三万多亩亩产一千斤以上籽棉的高产田施肥资料分析，基肥中所含氮、磷、钾养分大致占总施肥量的70％—80％，追肥占30％—20％。
    基肥过少，追肥过多，特别是后期追肥过猛，容易促使作物茎叶疯长，贪青迟熟，秸秆软弱，引起倒伏减产。例如，江苏省昆山县蓬阆乡虹桥社有一块中稻，基肥用量仅占总施肥量的37.5％，追肥占62.5％。结果抽穗比同期插栽的中稻推迟一星期，抽穗后就全部倒伏，不实粒高达60％，亩产仅五百斤。另一块中稻，基肥用量占总施肥量67.1％，追肥占32.9％。结果稻苗生育正常，穗头多，抽穗整齐，亩产高达四千五百零八斤。河南省偃师县岳滩社第七队小麦种子田，按施肥中含氮量计算，基肥中仅占24.4％，冬肥占16.5％，春肥占59.1％，在抽穗期便大部倒伏，严重影响产量。
    施用基肥以迟效性的有机肥料为主，并适当配合施用一些速效性肥料，使迟速效兼备。结合深耕分层匀施，使肥土融和，熟化土壤。迟效肥料施在下层，使之有足够的时间充分腐熟，缓慢分解，不断供应作物整个生育过程的需要。速效肥料施在上层，可以及时供应作物幼苗的营养需要，使生长健壮。四川成都平原水田分层施肥的经验是：先把一部分泥肥、堆肥、绿肥、厩肥撒在田面，翻入底层；再把其余的基肥撒在犁坯上，进行浅耕；再在耕起来的犁坯上泼人、畜粪尿，然后灌水耙田，栽秧前再施少量粪肥或硫酸铵作面肥。
    分层施肥的增产效果是很显著的。例如，江苏省昆山县蓬阆乡虹桥社有两丘密植程度、品种、土质、茬口、基肥数量相同的中稻田，一丘采取了分层施肥的方法，亩产稻谷一千一百八十八斤，比另一丘把全部基肥施在下层不施面肥的亩产稻谷九百斤增产32％。湖北潜江县，在同一块深耕一点八尺的地段上种植棉花，施用同量的肥料，分三层施肥的比不分层施肥的增产71.98％。
                分期追肥
    1958年农业丰产施肥经验证明，农作物要获得高产，不仅需要施足基肥，尤其要注意作物生育后期的追肥，这是争取水稻和小麦穗长穗大、粒多粒饱，棉花桃多桃大，提高产量和改善品质的重要环节。追肥应当根据农作物不同生长发育阶段的需肥特点，采取少吃多餐的方法，适时适量地分期多次追施各种肥料。既要做到肥力不脱，以满足作物生长发育不断的需要；同时也要避免肥力过分集中，影响作物正常生长发育，造成不良后果。
    水稻：
    1958年水稻丰产施肥经验是：在施足基肥的基础上，早追肥，施穗肥，补粒肥。早中稻追肥要早，以促使秧苗早生早发。湖南省的经验是，一般在插秧后即追施灰粪或化肥。江苏、安徽等地高产田的经验是，在秧苗移栽后一星期左右追肥。以后看苗促进。单季晚稻一般是在分蘖初期开始追肥。江苏省松江县的经验，单季晚稻追肥要掌握：“前轻（分蘖肥）、中重（穗肥）、后补足（粒肥）”的原则，分蘖初期施肥量宜占总施肥量的10％左右，幼穗分化及孕穗期占25％左右，抽穗前后占5％左右。
    在水稻幼穗分化期施用穗肥，可以促使穗大粒多，增产效果显著。穗子的雏型是在这个时期开始形成的，将来一个穗子有多少枝梗和小枝梗，每条枝梗和小枝梗结多少谷粒都决定了。此后只能使谷粒充实，不能再增加粒数。科学研究证明，幼穗分化期是水稻整个生育过程中养分吸收率最高的时期，也就是养分要求最迫切的时期。因此，这个时期的营养充足与否，对水稻产量是具有决定性意义的。在营养充足的情况下，可以增加穗子的分枝数和花数，促使穗大粒多；同时可以防止部分迟弱分蘖因营养不足而死亡，使有效穗数增加。相反地，在营养缺乏的情况下，分蘖将会大量死亡，使穗数减少；同时会影响穗枝的分化，减少小穗数和降低小花结实率，使穗小粒少。施用穗肥的时间，一般可以在离正常出穗期前一个月左右施用。穗肥应当施用速效性的磷肥和氮肥。
    在水稻出穗前半个月左右，正当雌雄蕊分化期，幼穗和颖花同时发育，需要的养分很多。如果这时营养不足，颖花会大量退化，不实粒增加。所以，在这个时候适当追施速效氮肥，可以助长颖花发育，减少不实粒，增加产量。这次追肥叫做粒肥，即农民所谓壮尾肥。江苏省松江县的经验，单季晚粳稻施用粒肥比不施用的每亩稻谷产量要相差二、三百斤。在水稻扬花灌浆期施用速效磷、钾肥，可以促使谷粒壮大饱满。
    过去，水稻施用穗肥和粒肥并不普遍，特别是在早稻和中稻上很少施用。过去一般地认为早稻和中稻生长期短，只要一次施足基肥，早追肥，分蘖停止就已成定局，再追肥会延迟成熟或造成倒伏危险。对于晚稻过去一般也认为幼穗形成后，已无能为力，再追肥不仅作用不大，而且容易使水稻贪青倒伏。1958年各地水稻丰产的经验证明，无论早、中、晚稻，正确地施用穗肥和粒肥，非但不会发生“危险”，而且能够增产。这就打破了过去对施用穗肥和粒肥的陈旧观点。
    冬小麦：
    1958年各地小麦丰产施肥经验表明，小麦施肥要做到“奠底、攻根、攻苗、攻茬、攻穗、攻籽”的连环促进作用。在施足基肥，施用种肥的基础上，根据苗、株、穗、粒不同生育时期的需要分期多次追肥。许多高额丰产田创造了“五肥六水”、“六肥八水”、“九肥十水”的施肥经验，打破了以往认为小麦不能多施肥，肥多会使小麦贪青徒长，引起倒伏的错误观念。
    冬季要施用分蘖肥和腊肥（也叫做盘根肥），以促进并巩固冬前分蘖，这是争取小麦高额丰产的一个重要环节。因为小麦的冬前分蘖生长发育时间长，有自己独立的根系，根系发育好，吸收养分和水分的能力强，生长健壮，大都是有效分蘖。而春季分蘖，由于发育晚，根系弱，吸收养分和水分的能力差，容易中途死亡，变成无效分蘖。在麦苗出土一个月左右，当麦苗开始分蘖时，追施速效性肥料作分蘖肥（农民叫做满月肥），可以促使麦苗分蘖旺盛，增加冬前分蘖。在越冬前要施用圈肥、栏粪等有机肥料作腊肥，以增加地温，保护麦苗安全越冬；同时可以供应麦苗所需养分，以巩固冬前分蘖，提高有效分蘖率。
    以往对小麦有“秋旺春不旺”的错误说法，说是：“秋苗高一尺，春天露地皮；秋苗二、三寸，春天盖满地”。因此，有些地方的麦田冬前不敢施追肥，怕冬前肥料足，麦子嫩，不抗冻，春天返青弱。1958年河北省安国县卓头社亩产小麦五千一百零三斤的卫星田施肥经验，在冬前施足追肥，促使麦苗生长健壮，多分蘖，每亩达一百三十万株；越冬时施圈肥盖麦，保暖防冻。一般麦苗地上叶子全部冻枯，而卫星田仅冻干三分之二，春季返青早，恢复生机快。返青后，勤追肥、灌水。由于肥足水够，使冬前分蘖保住了一百一十九万株，达分蘖总数的91％。事实证明，在肥足水够和加强田间管理的条件下，冬前分蘖是可以安全越冬的。同时，1958年小麦高产田经验证明，小麦冬前不仅需要追肥，而且冬前追肥还应重于冬后追肥。
    春季在小麦返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆等时期，都需要追肥，应当增施速效性氮、磷、钾肥料。早春，当麦苗返青时，由于经过了长时间的冬季低温环境，因而土壤中微生物的活动微弱，土壤中养分的分解很少，缺乏速效性的养料。但在这个时候，又正是麦苗生机转旺，麦穗形成的主要时期，幼穗开始分化，需要迅速吸收大量的养料，这时追施返青肥，不但可以巩固冬前分蘖，促进春季分蘖，提高有效分蘖率，使穗数增多，还可以增加小穗和小花数，促使穗大穗长。所以，这一次追肥很重要。这次追肥应以施用速效性氮肥为主，配合施用磷、钾肥料。小麦拔节、孕穗期，追肥可以提高小穗结实率，减少不孕的小花数，促使穗大粒多。这时期既要施用速效性氮肥，以满足孕穗开花的需要，还要配合施用磷肥和钾肥，促使秸秆粗壮，不易倒伏。小麦开花灌浆时期应适当追施一些速效性肥料，特别是磷肥，以促使麦粒饱壮，增高产量。
    以往各地习惯，一般在小麦拔节后就停止施肥管理，认为：“麦子起挺了，上粪也得不上力。”1958年各地小麦丰产经验，打破了这种陈规，证明加强小麦后期施肥管理是争取更大丰收的重要环节。
    棉花：
    1958年各地棉花丰产施肥的经验是，在施足基肥的基础上，采取苗期少施、中期多施、后期适量施的方法；同时，在施肥种类上，采取苗期追肥适当多施磷肥，少施氮肥；当开花期下部棉桃座稳后，分期多施氮肥；结铃期追施氮肥和磷肥作桃肥。这样施肥可以促使棉苗正常发育，控制徒长，早座桃。中期营养充足，后期也不脱肥，能够有效地减少蕾铃脱落，促使棉花桃多、桃大、桃稳。河南省新乡专区的经验是：苗期施肥量占追肥总量的10％左右，现蕾、开花期占60％左右，结铃吐絮期占30％左右。河北、河南、山西等地许多丰产棉田改变前期多施氮肥的习惯，采取前期重施磷肥，轻施氮肥，中期氮磷并重，后期重施氮肥的方法，增产效果显著。
    过去的习惯，棉花一般只是在幼苗、现蕾、开花等三个时期施用追肥，也就是说，追肥局限在棉花生长的早期和中期施用，开花期以后，不再施肥。一般认为棉花追肥不能晚于7月中旬，否则会使棉花贪青徒长，延迟成熟。因此，普遍流传着“处暑花、不回家”，“立过秋，万事休”的消极论调。
    1958年的经验，推翻了这个陈规，证明了棉花生长后期适当追肥，不但不会发生疯长，而且对争取多结秋桃，增加铃重，减少后期蕾铃脱落，会有显著的作用。例如，湖南省石门县新厂社，施用桃肥与不施用桃肥对比的结果，施后三十五天调查，每亩平均总成铃数要增多一万八千五百四十三个。河南省获嘉县冯庄调查，同块土地、同样栽培管理，每亩施用三十斤硫酸铵作桃肥的比不施用的增产籽棉八十二斤。棉花后期生育时间长，从开花、结铃到吐絮，为时达两个多月，这一期间棉花还需要大量养分的供应。如果这时营养不足，棉花的生育就会受到限制，棉铃不是脱落，便是发育不良，因而影响棉花的产量和品质。过去在棉花开花后就停止施肥，往往造成后期营养不足，棉株黄弱，上部空长果枝不成桃。所以，在棉花结铃吐絮期间适当追肥，以满足棉花后期生育的需要，可以促进生育旺盛，使伏桃长得大，秋桃结得又多又大。这是促进棉花增产的一个重要措施。
