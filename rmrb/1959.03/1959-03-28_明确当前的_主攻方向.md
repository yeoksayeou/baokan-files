    Clearly Define the Current "Main Offensive Direction"

    The Ministry of Coal Industry has summarized thirty-six major advanced experiences that proved effective during last year's Great Leap Forward, and designated them as the "main offensive direction" for this year's technical revolution. This is a good method for leaders to guide the mass movement centered on technical revolution. This method can give the mass movement centered on technical revolution this year a clearer and more specific goal, and can achieve greater results in a shorter period of time.

    Economic work should become more and more detailed. The mass movement centered on technical revolution on the industrial front this year should also be more detailed, deeper, and more solid than last year. In the work of industrial and mining enterprises, like other work, the ideological awareness of the people is a decisive factor. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly carry out meticulous ideological and political work among the masses. At the same time, the ideological awareness of the people is the basic driving force for them to master and innovate technology. People play a role in production by mastering and improving technology. Therefore, it is also necessary to carry out meticulous technical leadership work.

    What is meticulous technical leadership work? As far as the current situation is concerned, the most important thing is to propose specific goals and specific measures for the current technical revolution, focusing on the key problems in production and construction. Only in this way can we better organize the enthusiasm of the masses for technical revolution, give full play to the revolutionary drive and ingenuity of the masses, and closely integrate the inventions and innovations of the masses with the needs of current production and construction. Concentrate efforts on the current "main offensive direction" to solve the current key problems. In this regard, the practice of the Ministry of Coal Industry is very meaningful. Facing the great goal of producing 380 million tons of coal this year, and based on the actual situation of summarizing and applying the advanced technical experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, they are using the advanced technical experience that proved effective last year to innovate the old technologies in the weak links of this year's plan completion. The biggest benefit of this approach is that it can achieve "instant results." For example, promoting twelve advanced experiences in raw coal production can enable existing mines to increase production by nearly 50 million tons of coal this year without increasing equipment. What a huge gain this will be!

    It can be expected that by making the goals of the mass technical revolution in industrial and mining enterprises more specific and clear, and by fully utilizing the major advanced experiences that have proven effective, the mass movement centered on technical revolution on the industrial front this year will surely exert greater power in completing and overfulfilling the national plan. Consequently, it will inevitably further enrich and develop the existing advanced experiences, and make the technological level of our country's industry take a leap forward.

### 明确当前的“主攻方向”

    明确当前的“主攻方向”
    煤炭工业部总结了去年大跃进中行之有效的三十六项重大先进经验，作为今年技术革命的“主攻方向”，这是当前领导以技术革命为中心的群众运动的一个好方法。这种方法可以使今年以技术革命为中心的群众运动有更明确、更具体的目标，能够在较短时间内收到更大的效果。
    经济工作应该越做越细致。今年工业战线上以技术革命为中心的群众运动，也应该比去年更细致、更深入、更踏实。在工矿企业的工作中，像其他工作一样，人的思想觉悟是个决定因素，因而需要经常对群众进行细致的思想政治工作；同时，人的思想觉悟又是人们掌握技术革新技术的基本动力，人在生产中是通过掌握技术、提高技术来发生作用的，因而还需要进行细致的技术领导工作。
    什么是细致的技术领导工作呢？就当前说来，最重要的莫过于针对生产建设中的关键问题，提出当前技术革命的具体目标和具体措施。只有这样，才能更好地把群众技术革命的热情组织起来，充分发挥群众的革命干劲和聪明才智，使群众的发明创造和技术革新的内容紧密结合当前生产建设的需要。集中力量针对当前的“主攻方向”，解决当前的关键问题。在这方面，煤炭工业部的做法，是很有意义的。他们面对着今年生产三亿八千万吨煤的伟大目标，又立足于总结和运用去年大跃进的先进技术经验的实际，用去年行之有效的先进技术经验来革新今年完成计划中的薄弱环节上的旧技术。这种做法最大的好处是能够收“立竿见影”之效。例如，在原煤生产方面推广十二项先进经验，就可以使今年现有的矿井在不增加设备的条件下，实现增产近五千万吨煤的计划。这将是一个多么巨大的收获！
    可以预计，把工矿企业中群众性的技术革命的目标提得更具体明确，充分运用行之有效的重大的先进经验，那么，今年工业战线上以技术革命为中心的群众运动，必将在完成和超额完成国家计划中，发挥更大的威力，因而也就必然会进一步丰富和发展现有的先进经验，使我国工业的技术水平向前飞跃一步。
