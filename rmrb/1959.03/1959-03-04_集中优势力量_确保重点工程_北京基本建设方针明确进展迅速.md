    Concentrating Superior Forces to Ensure Key Projects
    Beijing Clarifies Basic Construction Policy with Rapid Progress

    (Our dispatch) In order to improve the finished product rate of basic construction and strive for new enterprises to be put into production as soon as possible, Beijing has adopted a policy of unified scheduling, shortening the front, phased assaults, ensuring key projects, and taking care of general projects in industrial basic construction, from the arrangement of engineering plans to civil construction, equipment manufacturing, and labor allocation.

    In the first quarter of this year, Beijing has a large industrial construction task. Should it proceed with priorities, concentrating forces and attacking in batches, or should it advance on all fronts, dividing forces? The Industrial Basic Construction Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee promptly summarized last year's construction experience. In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard," it resolutely adopted the policy of shortening the front, concentrating superior forces to ensure key projects, and arranged the engineering projects for the first quarter. During this quarter, for factories already under construction, it was decided to concentrate materials, investment, construction, installation, and equipment manufacturing to first focus on completing the following two types of projects: First, key projects that have completed a large amount of work and are very important; Second, projects that are nearing completion and urgently need to be finished. At the same time, it was determined that no new projects would generally be started during this quarter, and unplanned construction was strictly prohibited. For individual factories that urgently need to be built, they were also ordered to make full use of old houses or arrange production in existing factories. For each project that is determined to be constructed or continued to be constructed, they are also ranked according to their specific items, striving to determine the construction area according to the material supply situation as much as possible, and striving to avoid the phenomenon of a wide construction area, dispersing forces, and thus delaying the construction speed.

    In terms of civil construction, in order to focus on major key projects, it was decided to further shorten the front. On the premise of ensuring quality, organize rapid construction, quick battles and quick resolutions, and fight annihilation battles. At the same time, efforts are being made to complete the finishing works of eighteen factories and the projects that are about to be completed in the short term and put them into use one after another. Among these finishing projects, there are eight light industrial projects such as cotton blankets, pharmaceuticals, glass, and paper making.

    In terms of equipment manufacturing, corresponding arrangements were also made according to the project ranking for the entire season, based on the degree of importance and urgency. Prepare to first equip factories such as Beijing Steam Turbine Generator Factory so that they can fully exert their production power. At the same time, it was decided to investigate the equipment in factories that will not be launched for the time being and the equipment that various factories cannot use temporarily, uniformly allocate them, organize supporting facilities, and give priority to equipping the projects that have been ranked.

    In the process of labor allocation, the municipal labor department also paid attention to the project ranking, focusing on allocating new workers to key factories, so that the training of new workers in key enterprises can be completed on schedule, so that the new factories can be put into production upon completion.

    After Beijing adopted the above-mentioned policies in all aspects of basic construction, it ensured that key projects could be rapidly developed, and at the same time created conditions for other projects to be developed in turn.

    集中优势力量　确保重点工程
    北京基本建设方针明确进展迅速
    本报讯　为了提高基本建设的成品率，力争新建企业早日投入生产，北京在工业基本建设方面，从安排工程计划到土木建筑、设备制造和劳动力调配，都采取了统一排队、缩短战线、分批突击、保证重点、照顾一般的方针。
    今年第一季度，北京工业建设任务很大，是有先有后、集中力量，分批突击，还是齐头并进分兵把口？中共北京市委工业基本建设委员会及时总结了去年的建设经验，根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，坚决地采取了缩短战线、集中优势力量确保重点工程的方针，安排了第一季度工程项目。在这个季度内，对已经开工建设的工厂，决定集中材料、投资、施工、安装和设备制造的力量，首先突击完成以下两类工程：一、已经完成较大的工作量，而又是十分重要的重点项目；二、接近完成急需收尾的工程。同时确定在这个季度内一般不再开辟新的工程，严格禁止计划外的建设。对于个别急需建厂的工厂，也责令他们尽量利用旧房或在原有工厂中安排生产。对每个确定施工或继续施工的工程，也都按其具体项目进行排队，尽力做到按照材料供应情况决定开工面，力求避免开工面宽分散力量从而延缓建设速度的现象。
    在土木建筑方面，为了突击主要的重点工程，决定进一步缩短战线。在保证质量的前提下，组织快速施工，速战速决，打歼灭战。同时，对十八个工厂的收尾工程和快完工的工程，争取在短期内都陆续完工，交付使用。在这些收尾工程中，有棉毯、制药、玻璃、造纸等八个轻工业项目。
    在设备制造方面，也按照全季的项目排队，根据轻重缓急作了相应的安排。准备首先装备北京汽轮发电机厂等工厂，使它们充分发挥生产威力。同时决定把暂不上马的工厂内的设备和各厂暂时用不上的设备清查出来，统一调剂，组织配套，优先装备已经排上队的项目。
    在劳动调配过程中，市劳动部门也注意了根据项目排队，把新工人重点配备给重点工厂，使重点企业培训新工人的工作能按期完成，以便新厂落成就能投入生产。
    北京市在基本建设各方面采取上述方针后，保证了重点工程能够迅速上去，同时又为其他工程创造了大家都能依次上去的条件。
