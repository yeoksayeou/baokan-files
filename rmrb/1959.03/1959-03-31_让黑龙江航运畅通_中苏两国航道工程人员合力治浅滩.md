Let the Heilongjiang River Navigation Flow Smoothly
Chinese and Soviet Navigation Engineering Personnel Join Forces to Treat Shoals
    Chinese and Soviet navigation engineering personnel are braving the severe cold of minus twenty to thirty degrees Celsius to manage the "Xingdong" shoal project in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River. This rocky shoal is located in Xingdong Town, Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province. It is three thousand meters long and eighty meters wide, and it greatly hinders Heilongjiang navigation every dry season. The project to manage the shoal involves removing 100,000 cubic meters of riverbed rock, deepening the water depth from the original one meter to two point two meters, allowing unimpeded passage during the dry season.
    The remediation project is being carried out during the four months of the northern winter that are suitable for ice operations. After the Heilongjiang River water froze into a solid ice layer at the end of last November, Chinese and Soviet workers used the "water flow freezing method" to remove layers of ice from the riverbed, then drilled holes in the rocks, inserted explosives, and detonated them. At present, the shoal project of one thousand meters near the downstream direction has been completed, and the remaining two thousand meters of shoal are expected to be completed in 1962.

### 让黑龙江航运畅通  中苏两国航道工程人员合力治浅滩

    让黑龙江航运畅通
    中苏两国航道工程人员合力治浅滩
    中苏两国的航道工程人员正在冒着零下二、三十多度的严寒，整治黑龙江中游的“兴东”浅滩工程。这个岩石浅滩位于黑龙江省萝北县兴东镇，长达三千公尺、宽八十公尺，每年枯水季节，对黑龙江航运有很大妨碍。整治浅滩的工程，就是要清除掉这里十万立方公尺的河底岩石，使水深由原来的一公尺加深到二点二公尺，使枯水期可能畅行无阻。
    整治工程是利用北方冬季适于冰上作业的四个月时间进行的。去年11月底黑龙江水结成了坚硬的冰层后，中苏两国工人采用“水流冻结法”，一层层地清除河床上的冰块后，在岩石上钻孔，装入炸药，进行爆炸。现在，靠近下游方向的一千公尺浅滩工程已经完成，其余的二千公尺浅滩，预计在1962年可以完成。
