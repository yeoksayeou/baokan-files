    Henan Organizes Advanced Experience Transmission Team to Spread Key Techniques for High Yields from Small Blast Furnaces
    Master Wind Temperature and Multi-Nozzle Combustion
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, March 30th) Since Henan Province launched the high-yield and high-quality movement in steel production, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces has been continuously increasing. Currently, among the small blast furnaces in production throughout the province, over 38% are consistently producing more than one ton of iron per cubic meter of effective volume per day. Among them, an eight-cubic-meter small blast furnace at the Zhengzhou City Water Company produced 16.317 tons of iron on March 19th, with a utilization coefficient reaching 2.03; the No. 3 thirteen-cubic-meter small blast furnace at the Xinxiang City Second Steel Plant produced 26.895 tons of iron on March 20th, with a utilization coefficient reaching 2.069, setting a new record for the province. In addition, more than 30% of the small blast furnaces have utilization coefficients approaching one ton per day.
    The rapid increase in the utilization coefficients of these small blast furnaces is mainly due to the promotion of the hot blast furnace multi-nozzle combustion method. After the Xinxiang City Second Steel Plant adopted this method, the wind temperature increased from the original 420 degrees to 620 degrees. At the same time, the ore was roasted twice: the first time after the ore was crushed, and the second time by using slag to roast the crushed ore before immediately feeding it into the blast furnace for smelting while it was still hot. Various localities also used lime instead of limestone as a flux. Limestone absorbs heat before it can melt, but lime not only does not absorb heat, but also dissipates it, which helps to increase iron production and reduce the coke ratio.
    The quality of coke and ore used by these small blast furnaces with relatively high utilization coefficients in various localities is not high. Taking the Xinxiang City Second Steel Plant as an example, the ash content of the coke is about 30%, and the iron content of the ore is only 33% to 35%. Relevant departments in Henan Province are taking measures to actively improve the quality of coke and ore, implement the various technical measures formulated at the recent National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference, continue to increase the utilization coefficients of these advanced small blast furnaces, and draw a portion of personnel from these advanced small blast furnaces to form work groups to go to other places to transmit experience and help small blast furnaces with relatively low utilization coefficients catch up quickly, so that all small blast furnaces in the province can achieve high yields.
    Henan Province has eighty-one small blast furnaces with a capacity of five cubic meters or more already in production, with a total effective volume of one thousand and thirty-four cubic meters. Currently, they produce about half of the province's pig iron.

    河南组成先进经验传授队传播小高炉丰产要诀
    掌握风温多嘴燃烧
    本报郑州30日电　河南省的钢铁生产自从开展高产优质运动以来，小高炉的利用系数在不断提高，现在，全省已经投入生产的小高炉中，有38％多的小高炉每立方公尺的有效容积经常日产生铁在一吨以上。其中郑州市自来水公司的一座八立方公尺的小高炉，在本月19日产生铁十六点三一七吨，利用系数达到二点零三；新乡市第二钢铁厂的三号十三立方公尺的小高炉在20日产铁二十六点八九五吨，利用系数达到二点零六九，创造了全省最高纪录。此外，还有30％多的小高炉利用系数已经接近日产一吨的水平。
    这些小高炉利用系数的迅速提高，主要是推广了热风炉多嘴燃烧的方法。新乡市第二钢铁厂使用这个办法以后，风温就由原来的四百二十度提高到六百二十度，同时，对矿石进行了两次焙烧，第一次是在矿石粉碎以后，第二次把粉碎好的矿石，利用炉渣焙烧后，即趁热投入高炉冶炼，各地并且以石灰代替石灰石做熔剂，用石灰石吸热后才能熔化，可是石灰本身不但不吸收热能，而且还散热，这样便有助于提高铁的产量并降低焦比。
    各地的这些利用系数比较高的小高炉，使用的焦炭和矿石的质量并不高。以新乡市第二钢铁厂为例，焦炭的灰分为30％左右，矿石的含铁量只有33％到35％。河南省的有关部门正在采取措施积极提高焦炭和矿石质量，贯彻最近召开的全国小高炉生产技术会议所制定的各项技术措施，使这些先进的小高炉利用系数继续得到提高，并且从这些先进的小高炉抽调一部分人员组成工作组，到外地去传授经验，帮助利用系数比较低的小高炉，迅速赶上来，使全省的小高炉做到炉炉高产。
    河南省已经投入生产的五立方公尺以上的小高炉有八十一座，有效容积共有一千零三十四立方公尺，目前它生产的生铁约占全省一半。
