Three Major Marine Products of the Spring Fishing Season: Large Yellow Croaker, Small Yellow Croaker, and Prawns

　　Small Yellow Croaker – The small yellow croaker is a warm-water, near-sea migratory fish with a wide distribution in the western Pacific. It is found everywhere along the mainland coast of the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea within the 100-meter isobath, and is one of the more abundant marine fish in China. Small yellow croakers usually inhabit the middle and lower layers of clear seawater. In spring, as the water temperature rises, large groups migrate from the deep sea to the shallow, turbid waters near river mouths to spawn. After spawning, they disperse to feed, and in winter, as the shallow water temperature decreases, they migrate back to the deep sea to overwinter.

　　According to scientific analysis, the small yellow croakers along the coast of China can be roughly divided into three groups: the northern group migrates between the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea; the central group migrates between the southern Yellow Sea and the northern East China Sea; and the southern group migrates between the southern Yellow Sea and the Taiwan Strait.

　　The main season for catching small yellow croakers is during their spring spawning migration. Because their populations are concentrated at this time, it is easier to maximize the effectiveness of fishing gear, so the spring fishing season is the peak season for small yellow croakers. Taking the northern small yellow croaker group as an example, every year in March (before Qingming Festival), their populations begin to move north from their overwintering grounds in the depths of the Yellow Sea. In April, they pass the outer seas of the Shandong Peninsula and enter Liaodong Bay and Laizhou Bay in the Bohai Sea. From May to June, they spawn extensively in the Bohai Sea. The catch during the peak season is very high. A motorized fishing net often catches around 1,500 boxes (45 *jin* per box), and sailboat net catches have reached over 50,000 *jin*. Currently, fishing grounds in the north and south are investing in small yellow croaker production. The weather is warm this year, and a bumper harvest is expected.

　　Large Yellow Croaker – Although large and small yellow croakers are similar in shape, they should not be confused. Large yellow croakers weigh two to three *jin*, while the heaviest small yellow croakers are only a little over one *jin*. More importantly, small yellow croakers have about three more vertebrae than large yellow croakers, large yellow croakers have longer caudal peduncles than small yellow croakers, and the scales of large yellow croakers are finer than those of small yellow croakers. There are also many differences in their ecological habits.

　　Large yellow croakers are mainly distributed in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and are a major marine fish in China. Their total output is second only to small yellow croakers, with Zhejiang being the main producing area. The large yellow croaker fishing season in Zhejiang and northern Fujian runs from early April to mid-June, with the peak season in May; from Xiamen south to the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, the large yellow croaker fishing season is from October to February. There are significant differences between the north and south.

　　Nationwide, both large and small yellow croakers are abundant during the spring fishing season, and the most fishing boats are dispatched during these two fishing seasons. These two types of fish are produced in large quantities and are the most common non-staple foods in coastal provinces and cities. Large and small yellow croakers taste extremely delicious. Fresh fish, after careful processing and sliced, can also be frozen for export.

　　Prawns – "Prawns" are mainly distributed in the northern Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea and are produced in large quantities along the coasts of Shandong, Liaoning, and Hebei in China. Although they are found along the west coast of Korea, the output is not large. Therefore, prawns can be said to be a specialty of China.

　　The migration route of "prawns" is similar to that of northern small yellow croakers. Every year in March, they migrate from the deep sea towards the Shandong Peninsula. The main group passes through the Bohai Strait in mid-April and divides into several branches, spawning near the mouths of the Yellow River, Hai River, and Luan River. A small portion also goes to Liaodong Bay. By early May, these sea areas all enter the peak season. This is the situation during the spring fishing season. The young prawns grow quickly. By September, they gradually grow to a similar size to their parents. In November, they migrate back to the outer Bohai Sea. Therefore, every year in late autumn and early winter, some of the prawns that have grown up that year can be caught, which are called "shrimp money" in the market.

　　"Prawns" taste even more tender and delicious than fish and are rich in nutrition. They are the most popular aquatic product exported by China on the international market. In the Chinese market, prawns are priced by the pair, hence the name "prawns" (*dui xia*, meaning "paired shrimp").

### 春汛三大海产鱼类——大、小黄鱼和对虾

    春汛三大海产鱼类——大、小黄鱼和对虾
    小黄鱼——小黄鱼是温水性近海洄游鱼类，在太平洋西部分布范围很广。渤海、黄海和东海的大陆沿岸百公尺等深线以内，到处都有，是我国海洋鱼类产量较多的一种。小黄鱼平时栖息在清澄海水的中下层，春季水温上升，大群集中自深海游向浅海比较混浊的河口附近产卵，产卵后分散摄取食饵，冬季浅海水温降低再游往大海深处越冬。
    根据科学分析，我国沿海小黄鱼大体可分为三个群系：北方的群系移动于黄海和渤海之间；中部的群系移动于黄海南部和东海北部；南方的群系移动于黄海南部和台湾海峡。
    捕捞小黄鱼的主要季节是在它春天进行产卵洄游的时候。因为这时它的群体集中，容易发挥渔具效能，所以春汛是小黄鱼旺汛。以北方的小黄鱼群系来讲，每年3月（清明以前）它的群体开始从黄海深处的越冬场向北移动，4月经过山东半岛外海，进入渤海的辽东湾和莱州湾，5—6月间普遍在渤海产卵。旺汛的捕获量很高，机轮一网常常在一千五百箱左右（每箱四十五市斤），帆船网获量曾到过五万多市斤。目前南北各渔场正在投入小黄鱼生产，今年天气暖和，预料可以获得丰收。
    大黄鱼——大黄鱼和小黄鱼形体上虽很相似，但不能混淆。大黄鱼体重二——三市斤，小黄鱼最重的不过一市斤多，更主要的区别是：小黄鱼的脊椎骨节比大黄鱼的约多三节，大黄鱼比小黄鱼的尾柄长，大黄鱼的鳞比小黄鱼细。在生态习性上也有很多不同。
    大黄鱼的分布以东海和南海为主，是我国一种主要海产鱼类，总产量仅次于小黄鱼，以浙江为主要产区。浙江和福建北部的大黄鱼汛自4月初至6月中，旺汛在5月；厦门以南至广东雷州半岛一带，大黄鱼汛在10—2月。南北有很大不同。
    在全国范围来讲，大、小黄鱼都盛产在春汛，这两个渔汛出动的渔船也最多。这两种鱼类产量大，是沿海各省市最普通的副食品。大、小黄鱼味极鲜美，鲜鱼经过精细处理，割成鱼片，还可冷冻出口。
    对虾——“对虾”主要分布在黄海北部和渤海，在我国的山东、辽宁和河北沿海都大量生产，朝鲜西海岸虽有但产量不大，因而对虾可说是我国的特产。
    “对虾”和北方小黄鱼的移动路线差不多，每年3月间自深海游向山东半岛，主群4月中经过渤海海峡，又分成几支，到黄河口、海河口和滦河口附近产卵，也有一小部分到辽东湾，5月上旬这些海区都进入旺汛，这是春汛情况。幼虾成长很快，到9月渐渐长成和母体大小相似，11月又向渤海外方游去，所以每年秋末冬初还有一部分当年长成的对虾可捕，市场上称为“虾钱”。
    “对虾”的味道比鱼类更要鲜嫩，营养丰富，是我国出口的最受国际市场欢迎的水产商品。在我国市场上对虾是按对计价的，这就是“对虾”名称的由来。
