Managing rice seedbeds and cultivating strong seedlings is a crucial step in ensuring high rice yields.

How can rice seedbeds be well managed? First, the idea of striving for high rice yields must be instilled in the masses. Only when people have confidence in winning high yields and recognize the possibility of high yields will they try every means to do a good job in seedling cultivation. If one has the idea that "once the seeds are in the ground, everything is fine," then that is one step of relaxation, and it will be difficult to move forward.

To manage rice seedbeds well, it is also necessary to establish a set of inspection and management systems, so that responsibilities are assigned to individuals, tasks are specific, guidance is strengthened, and inspections are diligent. This is the organizational guarantee for cultivating strong seedlings.

In order to cultivate strong seedlings, moist seedbeds are worth promoting. The advantage of this type of seedbed is that after the rice is sown early, water can be irrigated to keep warm in case of cold waves; at the same time, because the field surface does not accumulate water and cause the seedlings to rot, more seedlings emerge. The article written by the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture introduces the technical measures of moist seedbed seedling cultivation in detail, which can be used as a reference for local areas to promote moist seedbeds.

    管好秧田，培育壮苗
    管好秧田，培育壮苗，这是保证水稻高产的重要一环。
    怎样才能管好秧田？首先要把争取水稻高产的思想贯彻到群众中去。只有当人们有了争夺高产的信心，认识到高产的可能性，就会千方百计地设法做好育苗工作。如果有了“种子下地，万事大吉”的思想，那就是一步放松，步步难行了。
    管好秧田，还必须建立一套检查管理制度，做到责任到人，任务具体，加强指导，勤于检查。这是育好壮秧的组织保证。
    为了培育壮秧，湿润秧田很值得推广。这种秧田的优点在于稻谷提早播种后，一旦遇到寒潮，可以灌水保温；同时由于田面不积水不致烂秧，因此成苗多。湖北省农业厅写的文章，比较详细地介绍了湿润秧田育苗的技术措施，可以作为各地推广湿润秧田时参考。
