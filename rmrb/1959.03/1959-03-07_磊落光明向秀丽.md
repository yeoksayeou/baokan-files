   “Noble and bright, facing splendor,
    Averting danger, setting right, striving for every bit.
    A person's integrity heavier than Mount Tai,
    A style like this, the world should learn.”
    This is Comrade Lin Boqu's inscription commemorating the female Communist Party member Xiang Xiuli, who gloriously sacrificed herself while rescuing state property, and it is prominently displayed at the "Comrade Xiang Xiuli's Deeds Exhibition."

    Xiang Xiuli was a female worker in the chemical workshop of the Hejigong United Pharmaceutical Factory in Guangzhou. On December 13th of last year, an alcohol bottle in this workshop was accidentally knocked over. A large amount of alcohol was ignited by the heat of the coal stove, and the flames quickly spread towards four boxes of metallic sodium that would explode upon contact with fire. A serious accident was imminent. At this critical moment, Xiang Xiuli stepped forward to extinguish the flames approaching the metallic sodium. Her shoes and pants caught fire, smoke billowed from her body, and the flames tightly wrapped around her. Still, she lunged forward to put out the fire. When the factory's Party branch secretary and the workshop director, having heard the news, led workers to the rescue, Xiang Xiuli was already engulfed in flames. They rushed to extinguish the fire on her, and in her dying breath, she struggled to say: "Leave me alone, quickly rescue the metallic sodium…."

    This serious accident was averted, but the young Communist Party member Xiang Xiuli suffered severe burns. Her upper garment was burned, leaving only the collar, and her outer pants were left with only the waistband and the left pocket. All the skin on her body, except above the neck and the area covered by the waistband, was burned. The muscles on her legs and left hand were charred black. When people saw her burned clothes and pants and her post-burn photos at the "Comrade Xiang Xiuli's Deeds Exhibition," many couldn't help but shed tears.

    Even after being seriously injured and taken to the hospital, Xiang Xiuli displayed the noble qualities of a Communist Party member in every way. Upon regaining consciousness, the first thing she asked the Party branch secretary was: "Did the metallic sodium explode? Did the factory suffer any losses?" When her mother visited her, she softly comforted her, saying: "I'm relieved that the factory wasn't burned." Her husband, a train driver, was always questioned by her during his visits: "Why aren't you at work? Don't visit me too often. Don't let thoughts of me distract you while driving, lest an accident occur." When she learned that the Party was doing everything possible to save her and that hundreds of people were lining up to donate blood and skin for her, she often said: "How can I repay the Party and comrades for their concern?"

    Kuang Yutong, the surgeon who cared for Xiang Xiuli day and night, described in an article how Xiang Xiuli, even when her life was hanging by a thread, still cared about others' progress. One evening, Xiang Xiuli was experiencing excruciating pain from her wounds. Kuang Yutong talked to her about the deeds of Qiu Caikang, a Shanghai steel worker who fought against severe burns. Moved by the story, she said: "I want to learn from Comrade Qiu Caikang." Kuang Yutong said: "I also want to learn from him, and also from you. I'm still a member of the Communist Youth League!" Xiang Xiuli said excitedly and earnestly: "Dr. Kuang, then you must work hard, create conditions, and strive to join the Party as soon as possible!" These words, like a warm current, permeated the young doctor's entire body. She excitedly replied: "Xiang Xiuli, I will definitely work hard in that direction!"

    During treatment, any touch to Xiang Xiuli's wounds was more painful than a knife cut, but she stubbornly endured it so that others would not be saddened by her suffering. On New Year's Eve last year, the hospital held a party. Upon hearing the dance music, Xiang Xiuli said to the doctors and nurses: "It's New Year's! You should dance. I can't get up now, but when I get better, I will definitely dance with you." When the doctors and nurses indeed started dancing and singing, Xiang Xiuli happily joined in the singing. On the last morning of her life, she gazed at the sunlight streaming through the window and still hopefully asked: "Doctor, how many more days until I can get out of bed and walk? How many more days until I can be discharged from the hospital and go back to work?" The medical staff who cared for her all said: Only a Communist Party member can have such strong will and revolutionary optimism.

    After thirty-three days of all-out rescue efforts, this staunch proletarian fighter, this good daughter of the Party, finally gloriously sacrificed herself due to the severity of her injuries. In the last moment before she stopped breathing, she used a very weak voice to instruct her husband: "Rely on the Party… listen to the Party, and always follow the Party."

    Xiang Xiuli grew into a glorious proletarian fighter under the Party's cultivation and education. She was born into a very poor working-class family. At the age of nine, she was a maid for a landlord, and at the age of eleven, she lived by working as a child laborer. In the early days of liberation, she was only sixteen years old. The Party sent a work team to the private Heping Pharmaceutical Factory where she worked to do mass work. Inspired and educated by the work team, she began to understand that the exploitation system was the root cause of the suffering of the poor and recognized that the Communist Party was working for the happiness of the people. Therefore, she was the first in the factory to apply to join the trade union. In 1952, she was elected as the trade union organization committee member and the grassroots trade union female workers' committee member of the Heping Pharmaceutical Factory. Under the help and encouragement of the trade union organization, she improved her work confidence and actively participated in the struggle in the "Five-Anti" movement. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the illegal capitalists took a passive attitude towards production. The factory lacked raw materials, and the workers' lives were threatened. It was difficult to carry out work. Xiang Xiuli had some negative thoughts at this time, but with the help of the Party and trade union organizations, she boldly exposed the illegal capitalists' conspiracies to the masses and worked with the workers to find ways to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, so that the factory production could return to normal. She was a piece-rate worker in the factory. After serving as a trade union cadre, she often had to take up production time to do trade union work, so her monthly salary dropped from more than forty yuan to more than twenty yuan. The higher-level trade union decided to find a way to take care of her, but she calmly said: "Trade union work is for everyone, and it must be done well no matter how difficult it is. Although my salary has been reduced, it is still much better than before liberation."

    On display at the exhibition were some of the books Xiang Xiuli had read during her lifetime and her notes. Two old books, "Devote Everything to the Party" and "How the Steel Was Tempered," were read by Xiang Xiuli when she was in the youth work study class organized by the Communist Youth League. In this study class, Xiang Xiuli heard and read the stories of Zoya, Paul, Wu Yunduo, and others for the first time. Xiang Xiuli was deeply educated by these heroic figures. She was determined to learn from them and dedicate her youth to the motherland.

    Soon after, she joined the Communist Youth League.

    In 1958, Xiang Xiuli grew more rapidly under the cultivation and education of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union organizations. At this time, she had been transferred to the Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory to work as a packaging worker. The factory decided to trial-produce a new product called "Methylthiouracil." Manufacturing this product required the use of the highly explosive raw material metallic sodium. The Party branch decided to transfer Xiang Xiuli to participate in the trial production, and she accepted without hesitation. Switching from a packaging worker to a pharmaceutical worker required learning quite complex production techniques, which was extremely difficult for Xiang Xiuli, who had only attended night school for more than three years. But she worked diligently with a tenacious spirit, often humbly learning from the masters, and she mastered various operating procedures in just over a month. During the city-wide mass steelmaking campaign, the factory transferred some workers to support iron smelting production. At this time, Xiang Xiuli took the lead in moving into the factory to eat and live, and she and another female worker, Luo Xiuming, took on the work of the original three people. They completed the task outstandingly, won the Outstanding Red Flag Award in the third quarter of last year, and Xiang Xiuli was also rated as an excellent worker and advanced producer in the quarter twice, and she also received a minor commendation in October.

    During the Great Leap Forward, the Party organization often cared about Xiang Xiuli's progress, and she herself also had the desire to join the Party. After the Party's cultivation and investigation, on October 31, 1958, she was gloriously accepted as a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party. After joining the Party, she was even stricter with herself and paid more attention to contacting and caring for the masses. Her companion Luo Xiuming recalled: "After Xiang Xiuli joined the Party, she was more concerned about my joining the Party. She said to me: Although you still have some shortcomings, as long as you are determined to correct them, you can strive to join the Party."

    Although Xiang Xiuli gloriously sacrificed herself, her influence on people is expanding day by day. Many factories and schools held memorial services and deed report meetings for Xiang Xiuli. People flocked to the Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory in Guangzhou to express their condolences to the Party branch for Xiang Xiuli. Many units and schools launched activities to learn from Xiang Xiuli. The heads of the Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal Committees of the Communist Youth League called on the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in Guangzhou to learn from Xiang Xiuli's noble qualities. Comrades Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, and Guo Moruo all wrote inscriptions in memory of Xiang Xiuli. Xiang Xiuli's lofty communist spirit and selfless heroic image will forever live in people's hearts.

    磊落光明向秀丽

   “磊落光明向秀丽
    扶危定倾争毫厘
    一身正比泰山重
    风格如斯世所师”
    这是林伯渠同志为纪念抢救国家财产而光荣牺牲的女共产党员向秀丽的题词，正陈列在“向秀丽同志事迹展览会”上。
    向秀丽是广州市何济公联合制药厂化工车间的女工。去年12月13日，这个车间里一个酒精瓶不慎被打翻了，大量酒精给煤炉蒸发的热气燃烧起来，附近堆放着四箱遇火就要爆炸的金属钠，烈火迅速向金属钠烧去，眼看一场严重的事故就要发生了。在这万分危急的关头，向秀丽挺身去扑灭那冲向金属钠的烈火，她的鞋、裤着火了，身上冒烟，火舌紧紧缠着她，她仍然纵身上前扑救。当工厂党支部书记，车间主任闻讯率领工人赶来抢救时，向秀丽已经成了一个火人，他们扑过去为她灭火，她在奄奄一息中仍然挣扎着说：“别管我，快去抢救金属钠……。”
    这一场严重的事故被抢救过来了，但是，年轻的共产党员向秀丽受了严重的烧伤。她的上衣烧得只剩下衣领，外裤只剩下裤头和左边的口袋，全身皮肤除了颈部以上和裤带部分外，全都烧伤了，双腿和左手的肌肉烧得焦黑。当人们在“向秀丽同志事迹展览会”里看到她被烧毁的衣、裤和她烧伤后的照片时，许多人不禁热泪盈眶。
    在身负重伤到医院里后，向丽秀也处处表现了共产党员崇高的品质。她清醒后看到党支部书记，第一句话就问：“金属钠有没有爆炸，工厂有没有受到损失？”她的妈妈去探望她时，她轻声安慰妈妈说：“没有烧到工厂，我就安乐了。”她的丈夫是个火车司机，当他去探望她的时候，她总是追问：“你怎么还不上班？不要常来看我，行车时不要为想我而思想开小差，免得发生事故。”当她知道党正在全力抢救她，有几百人排着长长的队伍要求为她输血、捐皮，就常常说：“党和同志这样关心我，我用什么来报答呢？”
    曾经日夜护理过向秀丽的外科医生邝宇同，在一篇文章中描述了向秀丽在生命垂危的时候，仍然关心别人进步的情形。这是一个晚上，向秀丽的创伤正发生剧痛，邝宇同和她谈起了上海钢铁工人丘财康同严重烧伤作斗争的事迹，她听了感动地说：“我要向丘财康同志学习。”邝宇同说：“我也要向他学习，同时要向你学习，我还是个共青团员！”向秀丽兴奋而恳切地对她说：“邝医生，那你就好好努力，创造条件，争取早日入党吧！”这些话像一股暖流渗透这位年轻医生的全身，她激动地回答：“亚丽，我一定朝这个方向努力！”
    在医疗中，向秀丽的伤面只要一被触动，就比刀割还要痛，为了不让大家为她的创伤难过，她顽强地忍受着。去年除夕，医院里举行晚会，向秀丽听到舞曲声，就对医生、护士说：“过新年啦，你们跳舞吧。我现在起不来，将来好了一定跟你们跳。”当医生、护士们果真跳起舞、唱起歌来的时候，向秀丽也高兴地唱起来了。在她生命中最后的一个早上，她凝望着窗外透进来的阳光，仍然满怀希望地问：“医生同志，还有几天我能下床走路，再过几天我能出院工作呢？”护理过她的医护人员都说：只有共产党员，才能有这样坚强的意志和革命的乐观精神。
    经过三十三天的全力抢救，这位无产阶级的坚强战士、党的好女儿，终于因伤势过重而光荣牺牲了。在她停止呼吸的前一刻，她用十分微弱的声音，叮嘱丈夫说：“要依靠党……听党的话，永远跟党走。”
    向秀丽是在党的培养、教育下，成长为一个无产阶级的光荣战士的。她出生在一个非常贫困的工人家庭里，九岁就给地主当婢女，十一岁就靠做童工过活。解放初期，她才十六岁。党派出工作队到她做工的私营和平制药厂做群众工作。经过工作队的启发、教育，她开始懂得了剥削制度是穷人受苦受罪的根源，认识到共产党是为人民谋幸福的。于是，她在厂里第一个申请参加了工会。1952年，她被选为和平药厂的工会组织委员和基层工会女工委员。她在工会组织的帮助、鼓励下，提高了工作信心，在“五反”运动中积极参加斗争。“五反”后，不法资本家消极对待生产，工厂原料缺乏，工人生活受到威胁，开展工作有困难，向秀丽这时曾有过消极想法，但在党和工会组织的帮助下，她大胆地向群众揭发不法资本家的阴谋，同职工一起设法开展增产节约运动，使工厂生产恢复正常。她在工厂里是计件工，担任工会干部后，常要占用生产时间做工会工作，因此每月工资由四十多元降为二十多元，上级工会决定设法照顾她，她却坦然地说：“工会工作是为大家的，多困难也得做好，我的工资虽然减少了，但总比解放前好多了。”
    在展览会上陈列着一些向秀丽生前阅读过的书籍和她的笔记。两本旧了的书“把一切献给党”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，是向秀丽在团组织举办的青工学习班时看的。在这个学习班里，向秀丽第一次听到了读到了卓娅、保尔、吴运铎等人的故事。向秀丽从这些英雄人物的身上，受到了深刻的教育。她决心要向他们学习，把自己的青春献给祖国。
    不久，她就参加了青年团。
    1958年，向秀丽在党、团和工会组织的培养、教育下，更加迅速地成长起来。这时，她已被调到何济公制药厂做包装工人。工厂里决定试制一种“甲基硫氧嘧啶”新产品，制造这种东西需要使用有强烈爆炸性能的原料金属钠。党支部决定调向秀丽参加试制，她毫不犹豫地接受了。从包装工转为制药工，需要学习相当复杂的制作技术，这对只上过三年多夜校的向秀丽是异常困难的。但她用顽强的精神去苦心钻研，经常虚心请教师傅，只一个多月就初步掌握了各种操作规程。在全市人民大搞钢铁运动中，工厂抽调了部分工人去支援炼铁生产，这时向秀丽带头搬到工厂里来食宿，并和另一个女工罗秀明两人担负起了原来三个人的工作。她们出色地完成了任务，在去年第三季度获得了优胜红旗奖，向秀丽还先后两次被评为季度的优良工作者和先进生产者，10月份又立了一小功。
    在大跃进中，党组织经常关心着向秀丽的进步，她自己也有入党的要求。经过党的培养和考察，她在1958年10月31日，光荣地被接收为中共预备党员。她入党后更加严格地要求自己，更注意联系群众、关心群众。她的同伴罗秀明回忆说：“秀丽入党后更加关心我的入党问题了，她对我说：你虽然还有一些缺点，但只要有决心改正，就可以争取入党。”
    向秀丽虽然光荣牺牲了，但是她给予人们的影响却一天天在扩大。许多工厂、学校举行了向秀丽的追悼会、事迹报告会。到广州市何济公制药厂向党支部表示悼念向秀丽的人们络绎不绝。许多单位和学校开展了学习向秀丽的活动。中共广州市委宣传部、共青团广东省、广州市委负责人，都号召广州市的共产党员、共青团员学习向秀丽的高贵品质。林伯渠、董必武、郭沫若等同志都为纪念向秀丽题词。向秀丽崇高的共产主义精神和舍己为群的英雄形象，将永久活在人们的心上。（附图片）
