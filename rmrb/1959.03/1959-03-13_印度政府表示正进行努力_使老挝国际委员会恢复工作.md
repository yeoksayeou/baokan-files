    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 11th. Indian Deputy Minister of External Affairs, Mrs. Menon, said today that the Indian government "is working to enable the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to deal with issues related to the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, in accordance with the opinions expressed by the two chairmen of the (Geneva Conference) in their recent letter of January 31, 1959."
    She said this in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of the Indian Parliament). She said that the Indian government has taken note of the letter from Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference regarding the statement made by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos on the Geneva Agreement on Laos, and has also taken note of the statement made by the Chinese Foreign Minister on this issue. She made the above remarks when talking about the Indian government's reaction to this issue.
    In a statement issued on February 11, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, stated that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva Agreement. Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi issued a statement on February 18, and subsequently sent a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, expressing his firm opposition and calling for a halt to the US-orchestrated conspiracy of the Kingdom of Laos to renounce the Geneva Agreement, so that the International Commission in Laos can continue its activities and maintain peace in the Indochina region.

    印度政府表示正进行努力
    使老挝国际委员会恢复工作
    新华社新德里11日电　印度外交部副部长梅农夫人今天说，印度政府“正在努力使老挝国际监察和监督委员会根据（日内瓦会议的）两位主席最近在1959年1月31日的信件中所表示的意见，处理同关于在老挝停止敌对行动的日内瓦协定有关的问题”。
    她是在人民院（印度国会下院）书面答复问题时这样说的。她说，印度政府已经注意到中国外交部长陈毅就老挝王国首相发表的关于老挝的日内瓦协议问题的声明，写给日内瓦会议的两位主席的信件；也已经注意到中国外交部长就这个问题发表的声明。在谈到印度政府对这个问题的反应时，她发表了上述的意见。
    老挝王国首相萨纳尼空在2月11日发表的声明中，表示老挝不再受日内瓦协议的约束。中国外交部长陈毅在2月18日发表声明，随后并致函日内瓦会议两位主席，表示坚决反对，并呼吁制止美国策动老挝王国毁弃日内瓦协议的阴谋，使老挝国际委员会能够继续活动，维护印度支那地区的和平。
