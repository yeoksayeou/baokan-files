    A Matter of Life and Death

    On March 10th, the U.S. government, citing "the U.S. coal market is also experiencing a severe crisis" as a reason, warned the six countries of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" that if they wanted to restrict U.S. coal imports, it would have "serious consequences." The so-called "serious consequences" refer to the U.S. taking "retaliatory measures and reducing aid to Europe" on European exports.

    Coal piles up like mountains at the entrances of mines in European countries, and hundreds of thousands of miners are unemployed. The Western European "Coal and Steel Community" has declared a "state of emergency" and decided to cut coal production. At this time, Washington is brandishing a big stick, forcing Western European countries, whose stomachs are about to burst, to stubbornly continue to swallow U.S. surplus coal. But at the same time, the U.S. has been restricting imports of lead, zinc, wool fabrics, and cotton fabrics, and last week extended the restriction on oil imports.

    The "New York Times" once suggested to its government that when Washington takes such "protective measures," it does not care at all about the "serious consequences" for others.

    A popular saying in the West today is: "Live and let live." However, the U.S. policy towards its allies is to let itself live, but not let others live.

    你死我活
    3月10日美国政府以“美国煤炭市场也经历着严重危机”为理由，警告西欧“煤钢联营”六国，如果它们想限制美国煤炭入口，就会产生“严重影响”。所谓“严重影响”就是指美国要对欧洲出口的产品“采取报复措施，并减少对欧洲的援助”。
    欧洲各国矿井上存煤山积，成千上万的矿工在失业。西欧“煤钢联营”已宣告“危急状况”，决定削减煤的生产。在这时候，华盛顿却挥动大棒，要肚皮已经快账破的西欧国家硬着脖子继续吞下美国过剩的煤。但同时，美国一直在限制铅、锌、毛织品和棉织品的进口，上周并又延长了限制石油进口的期限。
    “纽约时报”曾给它的政府提出华盛顿采取这类“保护性措施”时，可丝毫也没有管顾这对别人的“严重影响”。
    西方目前流行的一句话是：“自己活下去，也让别人活下去。”但是，美国对它的盟国却是只要自己活下去，而不让别人活下去。
