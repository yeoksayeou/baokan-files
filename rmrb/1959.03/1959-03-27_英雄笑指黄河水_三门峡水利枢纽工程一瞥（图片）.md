Heroes constructing the Sanmenxia Hydraulic Engineering Project are intensifying their efforts to pour concrete for the dam with soaring enthusiasm. They aim to raise the upstream face of the dam to a height of over 30 meters before the end of June, to hold back this year's Yellow River flood.

Currently, the comb-shaped structure (bridge piers of the spillway) on the left bank has been poured to a height of 30 meters. On the right bank, the power station dam body being poured on the original riverbed of the Yellow River also began pouring concrete on March 6th.

	1. The right wing of the dam is being poured at an accelerated pace.

	2. The center of the Yellow River, formerly impacted by three torrents, is now having its dam foundation poured. The dam will soon stand tall here.

    英雄笑指黄河水
    ——三门峡水利枢纽工程一瞥
    建设三门峡水利枢纽工程的英雄们，正以冲天干劲，加紧浇筑拦河大坝。他们要在六月底以前把坝体迎水面部分浇筑到三十多公尺高，拦住今年的黄汛。
    现在，左岸的梳齿工程（溢洪道的桥墩）已经浇筑到三十公尺高；右岸在黄河原来的河床上浇筑的电站坝体工程，也在三月六日开始浇筑。
    1、大坝右翼正在加紧浇筑。
    2、过去三股激流冲击的中心，现在正在浇坝基。大坝就要在这里矗立起来。
    3、远眺三门峡工程。 
    4、大坝的“粮仓”——混凝土拌合系统。本报记者　杨震河摄
