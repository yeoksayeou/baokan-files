Combining Production to Support Production
　　Xiang Dong

The Shanghai Municipal Health Department has decided to continue transferring and assigning medical personnel to factories and rural areas to strengthen preventive healthcare organizations in production units, or to partner with various counties to support the medical and health work of people's communes; this is an important guarantee for accelerating the elimination of diseases and improving labor attendance rates.

In 1958, the Shanghai municipal medical and health departments, in coordination with the Great Leap Forward in production, had already made considerable achievements and gained good experience. One of the main experiences was clarifying the idea of "health serving production, production paying attention to health," truly achieving health work serving production. Many medical personnel walked out of hospitals and schools and went to the forefront of production. They went deep into factories and rural areas, proactively understanding the situation and problems in production and health work, and understanding the suffering and demands of the working masses; under the leadership of grassroots Party organizations, and together with the broad masses, they thoroughly launched mass patriotic health campaigns, actively carried out labor hygiene and occupational disease prevention work, thereby basically controlling many occupational diseases, such as silicosis; and gradually solved some long-unresolved health problems. According to statistics, in Shanghai's factory and enterprise system last year, the absenteeism rate due to illness decreased from 6.1% in 1957 to 3.25%, which is equivalent to an increase of more than 5.2 million workdays in the city in 1958, equivalent to an increase of 14,500 workers. What a huge and exciting number this is!

This vivid figure inspires us that industrial and agricultural production units, in order to complete and over fulfill this year's production leap forward targets, must grasp labor hygiene and protection work while grasping production. The fact that Shanghai's industrial system greatly reduced the absenteeism rate due to illness in last year's Great Leap Forward in production proves that the more tense production is, the more it is necessary to strengthen labor hygiene and protection work. Many factories in Shanghai, in order to improve labor attendance and labor efficiency, have incorporated labor hygiene and protection work as one of the measures into the production work plan, made overall arrangements, strengthened leadership, and regularly inspected. In this way, the struggle to eliminate diseases can be closely combined with the battle of intense production.

After the production units have taken up the work of "health serving production, production paying attention to health," the medical and health departments need to cooperate more closely and strengthen health work. This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value is required to increase by 55% compared to last year, therefore requiring each labor force to be worth one and a half of last year's labor force. This requires further reduction of the absenteeism rate of workers due to illness. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Health Department, on the basis of last year's great achievements, continues to implement the policy of "health serving production," and continues to transfer and assign medical personnel to factories and rural areas, which will inevitably better guarantee the health and protection work of production units to eliminate diseases. If the national medical and health departments can closely combine with production, implement serving production, and cooperate with production units, then the health and protection work of industrial and agricultural production units in various places will inevitably be greatly strengthened, the work of eliminating diseases will inevitably be greatly accelerated, and the labor attendance rate in cities, factories, and rural areas will inevitably be greatly improved.

    结合生产支援生产

    上海市卫生部门，决定继续抽调和下放医务人员到工厂农村去加强生产单位的预防保健组织，或是同各县挂钩支援人民公社的医疗卫生工作；这是加速消灭病害提高劳动出勤率的重要保证。
    1958年，上海市的医药卫生部门，配合生产大跃进，已经作出了不少成绩，取得了良好经验。主要的经验之一，就是明确了“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”的思想，真正作到了卫生工作为生产服务。许多医务人员走出医院、学校，奔上生产前线。他们深入工厂、农村，主动了解生产和卫生工作中的情况和问题，了解劳动群众的疾苦和要求；他们在基层党组织的领导下，和广大群众一起，深入开展群众性的爱国卫生运动，积极开展劳动卫生和职业病的防治工作，从而基本控制了许多职业病，如矽肺病等；逐步解决了某些长期未得解决的卫生问题。据统计，去年上海工厂企业系统，因病缺勤率由1957年的6.1％，降低到3.25％，等于全市在1958年内增加了五百二十多万个劳动日，相当于增加了一万四千五百个工人。这是一个多么巨大而令人兴奋的数字啊！
    这个生动的数字启示我们，工农业生产单位为了完成和超额完成今年的生产跃进指标，在抓生产的同时，还须抓好劳动卫生和防护工作。上海市产业系统在去年生产大跃进中，取得了大大降低因病缺勤率的事实证明，生产越紧张，就越需要加强劳动卫生和防护工作。上海很多工厂为了提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率，把劳动卫生和防护工作作为措施之一，订入生产工作计划中，统筹安排，加强领导，经常检查。这样，消灭病害的斗争，就能和紧张生产的战斗，密切地结合起来。
    在生产单位把“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”这一工作抓起来后，医药卫生部门就需要更密切合作，加强卫生工作。今年上海的工业生产总产值要求比去年增长55％，因此要求每个劳动力抵得上去年的一个半劳动力。这就要求进一步地降低工人的因病缺勤率。现在，上海市卫生部门已经在去年巨大成就的基础上，继续贯彻“卫生为生产服务”的方针，继续抽调和下放医务人员到工厂农村去，必将更好地保证生产单位消灭病害的卫生和防护工作。全国医药卫生部门如果都能紧密结合生产，贯彻为生产服务，同生产单位协作，那么，各地工农业生产单位的卫生和防护工作必然能够大大加强，消灭病害的工作必然能够大大加速，无论城市、工厂、农村的劳动出勤率必然能够大大提高。
