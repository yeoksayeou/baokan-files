Xinhua News Agency, March 7th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of industrial cadres on the 6th, calling on cadres and workers on the city's industrial front to seize the production in March, immediately organize a larger production upsurge, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the first quarter industrial production plan.

At the meeting, units such as the Iron Smelting Plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Chemical Factory, and Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory introduced their experiences in deeply mobilizing the masses, formulating great leap forward plans, and organizing production upsurges. Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and Jia Tingsan, Minister of the Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department, spoke at the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that all enterprises in the city are currently widely mobilizing the masses and formulating great leap forward plans. Many units are paying close attention to this, with deep mass mobilization, thorough ideological work, advanced indicators, and specific measures. They are closely integrating the formulation of great leap forward plans with the organization of production upsurges. Therefore, a new and vibrant situation has emerged in production. However, a few enterprises have not yet taken action, mainly because a few leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the situation of this year's Great Leap Forward, one-sidedly emphasize certain unfavorable conditions, and lack confidence in boldly mobilizing the masses. Therefore, their actions are not quick, and their determination is not strong. Some leading cadres of industrial departments are always staying in their offices holding lengthy meetings, and are slow to meet with the masses. These units should quickly catch up. The meeting pointed out that the key to formulating a good great leap forward plan and organizing a production upsurge lies in boldly mobilizing the masses, revealing the bottom line to the masses, implementing the plan among the masses, so that each group and each worker clearly knows their tasks, problems in production and specific measures, and gives full play to their maximum initiative and enthusiasm, and struggles to comprehensively overfulfill the first quarter plan.

The meeting believed that the central task on the city's industrial front at present is to seize production in March, immediately organize a larger production upsurge, quickly take action, strive for high quality and high yield every day without any relaxation, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the first quarter industrial production plan, to create better conditions for a greater leap forward in the second quarter.

The meeting pointed out that under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers on Beijing's industrial front have won successive victories in the first two months of this year, but they must never be proud, complacent, or slack. It should be seen that although the city's total industrial output value plan has been completed, the plans of a few enterprises have not been completed, and the production plans of some major products have not been completed. Therefore, striving to comprehensively overfulfill the first quarter plan, and achieving a simultaneous leap forward in all aspects of output value, major product output and quality, and cost, is a very serious task. All units must firmly seize the crucial period of March, further boldly mobilize the masses, carry out the five comparisons (comparing efficiency, comparing varieties, comparing quality, comparing costs, and comparing safety) and four investigations (investigating consumption quotas, investigating warehouses, investigating semi-finished products, and investigating personnel quotas), organize competitions and appraisals, and launch a greater production upsurge. The meeting pointed out that the key at present lies in leadership. Leading cadres of the relevant departments and enterprises at the municipal and district levels must immediately go to the front line, and participate in productive labor in a planned way, to better direct production.

    北京市委号召全市厂矿职工
    超额完成一季度生产任务
    新华社7日讯　中共北京市委6日召开工业干部会议，号召全市工业战线上的干部和广大职工抓紧3月份的生产，立即组织更大的生产高潮，力争全面超额完成第一季度工业生产计划。
    会上，石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂、北京化工厂、北京冷风机械厂等单位，介绍了他们深入发动群众、制订跃进计划、组织生产高潮的经验。中共北京市委书记处书记郑天翔、市委工业部长贾庭三在会上讲了话。
    会议指出，目前全市各企业正在广泛发动群众，制订跃进计划。有许多单位是抓得很紧，群众发动深入，思想工作深入，指标先进，措施具体，并且把制订跃进计划同组织生产高潮紧密地结合起来，因此，生产上出现了热火朝天的新局面。但是，也有少数企业至今尚未行动，主要是由于少数领导干部对今年大跃进的形势认识不足，片面地强调某些不利条件，对放手发动群众信心不足，因而动作不快，决心不大；有一些工业部门的领导干部，老是呆在办公室里召开冗长的会议，迟迟不和群众见面。这些单位应该迅速赶上去。会议指出：订好跃进计划组织生产高潮，关键在于放手发动群众，向群众交底，让计划在群众中落实，使每个小组、每个工人都清楚知道自己的任务、生产中的问题和具体措施，发挥最大的主动性和积极性，为全面超额完成第一季度计划而斗争。
    会议认为，当前全市工业战线上的中心任务是，抓紧3月份生产，立即组织一个更大的生产高潮，迅速投入行动，一天也不放松地力争天天优质高产，力争全面超额完成第一季度工业生产计划，为第二季度更大的跃进创造更好的条件。
    会议指出，北京工业战线的广大职工在党的领导下，今年头两个月连续打了胜仗，但是绝不能因此产生任何骄傲自满和松懈情绪。应该看到，虽然全市工业总产值计划完成了，但是有少数企业的计划没有完成，一部分主要产品的产量计划也没有完成。因此，力争全面超额完成第一季度计划，在产值、主要产品产量和质量、成本等各方面同时跃进，是一个非常严重的任务。各单位必须紧紧抓住3月这个关口，进一步放手发动群众，开展五比（比效率、比品种、比质量、比成本、比安全）四查（查消耗定额、查仓库、查半成品、查人员定额）运动，组织竞赛评比，发动更大的生产高潮。会议指出，当前的关键在于领导。市、区各有关部门和企业领导干部要立即亲临前线，并且要有计划地参加生产劳动，更好地指挥生产。
