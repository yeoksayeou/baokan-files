Advocating a Pragmatic Style
　　Zu Nian

The vast number of cadres in Ningxiang and Changning Counties, Hunan Province, are closely integrated with the masses in spring plowing and production. They are steadfastly and realistically continuing to implement working methods such as planting experimental fields, holding on-site meetings, and regularly commending advanced elements to drive the general population. This proves that only when cadres at all levels delve into actual production can they better combine ideological guidance with practical work and achieve the goal of "guiding practice with theory."

It is crucial to frequently integrate theory and practice in our work. "Practice" means having a pragmatic work style, obtaining perceptual knowledge directly and indirectly through personal practice and listening to reports on actual work. "Theory" means elevating various phenomena to rational knowledge based on practice, thereby achieving an understanding of the development laws of various practical tasks, and promoting practical work through conscientious theoretical guidance.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, cadres have made great achievements in integrating theory and practice, guiding practice with theory, and raising ideological awareness, which has not only promoted the development of production but also theoretically armed the minds of cadres, allowing them to advance confidently and victoriously. In the current high tide of a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward, it is still necessary to promote this approach of combining theory and practice, and emphasis should be placed on practice. Why? The relationship between theory and practice is essentially the relationship between theory and reality. "Theory" is rational knowledge, and "reality" is the source of knowledge. Rational knowledge depends on perceptual knowledge, and perceptual knowledge needs to be developed into rational knowledge. Practice is about obtaining perceptual knowledge, and theory is about rising from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. Facts have proven that only by working practically can we better guide practice with theory. In its work, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, proposed that cadres should first talk about experimental fields in their reports, and that experimental fields should be evaluated first in inspections and appraisals, and that advanced technologies should be promoted first in experimental fields, thereby making the work of cadres at all levels more in-depth and continuously improving their leadership skills. Mao Sanyuan, the Party Secretary of Guanyang Commune in Changning County, after participating in the county party committee's on-site meeting on manure accumulation held in Yintian Commune and gaining experience, immediately went to the production team under his charge, explained the facts and reasoned with them. Within ten days, the production team jumped from second to last in manure accumulation to first. These facts show that leadership work must have a style of going deep into reality in order to better engage in theory and guide practice with theory. If we deviate from reality and do not seek practicality, even if we have correct ideas, they will only be empty talk, or even lead to exaggeration, violating the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

Therefore, in leading current production activities, we should conscientiously go deep into the masses and into reality to do our work well, and realistically derive objective development laws from practical work to better guide the progress of our work. Only by grasping practice can we possibly grasp more practical information in leading production work, be well-informed, align with objective reality, and guide our work more effectively.

At present, in leading production activities, leading cadres should advocate a pragmatic style and continue to adopt working methods such as planting experimental fields, holding on-site meetings, conducting in-depth investigations into key areas, and participating in productive labor, breaking through one point to promote the whole. This is an important link in promoting a greater leap forward.

    提倡切实的作风
    祖年
    湖南宁乡、常宁县广大干部，在春耕生产中，密切地同群众在一起，踏踏实实和实事求是地继续贯彻种试验田、召开现场会议、经常表扬先进带动一般等的工作方法，证明了各级干部只有深入生产实际，才能更好地做到务虚务实相结合，达到“以虚带实”的目的。
    在工作中经常务虚务实是非常重要的。“务实”就是要有切实的工作作风，通过亲身实践和听取实际工作的汇报，直接和间接地取得感性知识；“务虚”就是在务实的基础上，把各种现象提高到理性知识，从而达到认识各项实际工作的发展规律，经过认真地务虚来推动实际工作。
    1958年大跃进以来，在干部中，务虚务实、以虚带实、提高思想，做得很有成绩，不仅推动了生产的发展，也从理论上武装了干部的头脑，从而满怀信心地胜利前进。在今年更大更好更全面的大跃进高潮中，还须发扬这种务虚务实相结合的作法，并且要着重务实。为什么呢？虚和实的关系，原来是理论和实际的关系。“理论”是理性认识，“实际”是认识的源泉。理性认识依赖于感性认识，感性认识有待于发展到理性认识。务实就是获得感性认识，务虚就是从感性认识上升到理性认识。事实证明，只有切实地工作才能更好地务虚，作到以虚带实。湖南宁乡县在工作中，提出干部汇报先谈试验田、检查评比先评试验田、推广先进技术先推广试验田，从而使各级干部工作更加深入，领导水平不断提高；常宁县官阳公社党委书记毛三元，参加县委在荫田公社召开的积肥现场会议得到感受后，回到公社立即深入到分工领导的生产队，讲事实摆道理，十天内就使这个生产队由原来积肥倒数第二跃居第一。这些事实说明，领导工作必须要有深入实际的作风，才能更好地务虚，以虚带实。如果脱离实际，不求务实，即使有了正确的思想，也只是空谈一阵，甚至形成虚夸，违反了实事求是的精神。
    因此，当前领导生产活动，应该踏踏实实地深入群众、深入实际来做好工作，并从实际工作中实事求是地得出客观的发展规律，更好地指导工作的前进。也只有抓住务实，才有可能在领导生产工作中，掌握更多的实际情况，做到心中有数，切合客观实际，更有力量地指导工作。
    目前，在领导生产活动中，领导干部要提倡切实的作风，继续采用种试验田，召开现场会议，深入重点进行调查，以及参加生产劳动，突破一点推动一般等工作方法。这是推动更大跃进的重要一环。
