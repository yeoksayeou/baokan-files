More than 8,000 representatives from over fifty labor unions, democratic groups, workers, and citizens of Kanagawa Prefecture participated in the rally.
    The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government cease negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and immediately break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.
    The resolution demanded that the prefectural government dismantle all military bases located within the prefecture and declare Kanagawa Prefecture a nuclear-free zone.
    The resolution also put forward fourteen demands to the government and the Kanagawa Prefectural government regarding providing living assistance to the unemployed.
    The resolution stated that if the Kishi Nobusuke government and the prefectural government ignore these demands, they will do everything in their power to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    Lin Longyi, the captain of the South Route marching contingent, spoke at the meeting. He said that the participants in the grand march had received a warm welcome from the people along the way, which showed that the grand march had the sincere support of all the Japanese people. Lin Longyi stated that all participants in the march would unite with the workers to launch a thorough struggle to win the victory of the Spring Struggle and oppose the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    After the meeting, all participants and the marching contingent held a demonstration march in the city.
    Prior to this, the South Route marching contingent arrived in Yokosuka, where there is a U.S. naval base, on the 2nd. More than 1,500 workers and citizens held a rally to warmly welcome the marching contingent. Workers who had recently become unemployed due to the closure of factories contracted to repair U.S. military vehicles actively participated in the march.
    The North Route marching contingent arrived in Omiya City this afternoon and participated in a citizens' rally.
    The North and South Route contingents will arrive in Tokyo, the final destination of the march, tomorrow afternoon and then participate in the "Central General Uprising Rally Against War and Unemployment" which will be attended by 30,000 people.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions said today in a telegram to the Japanese "National Grand March Against War and Unemployment Central Rally": "Chinese workers have always regarded your struggle as their own and your victory as their own."
    The Japanese National Grand March Against War and Unemployment is scheduled to converge in Tokyo on March 4th to present the Kishi Nobusuke government with their demands regarding abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, and immediately raising workers' wages. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today expressed warm congratulations and high respect to the Japanese people participating in this grand march in a telegram. The telegram said: "We firmly believe that the heroic and tenacious Japanese people and worker brothers will unite more extensively through this grand march and make greater contributions and achieve greater victories in the struggle for independence, peace, and democracy."
