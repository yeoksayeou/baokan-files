Fuzhou, March 13th (By Our Reporter) The Five-Star Commune in Shishan Township, Nan'an County, Fujian Province, used its experience in increasing production through dense planting last year and, together with the masses, discussed and formulated rice dense planting specifications based on local conditions.

The Five-Star Commune in Shishan Township achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, transforming from a historically grain-deficient township to a surplus grain township. When summarizing last year's experience in increasing production, the masses believed that in addition to water conservancy, fertilizer, and other measures to increase production, dense planting was one of the important keys to increasing production; however, dense planting must be carried out to varying degrees according to different production conditions, and it is by no means the denser the better. Many mountain fields in the Meishan Brigade last year were applied with more than 330 dan of local miscellaneous fertilizer and used the "Hongmi Early" rice variety, but those using 5×3 cun dense planting (i.e., 5 cun row spacing, 3 cun plant spacing) yielded 100 jin more per mu than those using 5×2 cun dense planting, and 50 jin more than 5×4 cun. Last year, most of the more than 1,000 mu of mountain fields in the Jianxi Brigade used 5×2 cun dense planting, with only a few using 5×3 cun and 4×4 cun dense planting. At harvest time, the 5×2 cun mountain fields yielded significantly more than the sparse planting in 1957, but yielded more than 200 jin less per mu than the 5×3 cun and 4×4 cun dense planting fields. Many commune members also believed in the discussion that dense planting should be coordinated with fertilizer, seeds, and soil improvement and other measures to increase production, and dense planting cannot be studied in isolation.

Based on the summary of last year's dense planting experience, after discussion by the masses, and according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, the commune's dense planting plan for this year was formulated. First, most of the plain paddy fields will use 5×2 cun, and some will use 5×3 cun, with eight to ten seedlings planted per clump. According to the analysis of the masses in the Jin Tao, Shan Tou, and Ma Tou brigades, which have more plain paddy fields: plain paddy fields are generally more fertile, have good water conservancy, and have a warm climate, so seedlings should be planted more densely and with more plants per clump; as long as attention is paid to air circulation and weeding and other work, it can be guaranteed to increase production. Second, mountain fields and semi-mountain fields generally use 5×4 cun, and some also use 5×3 cun and 7×4 cun dense planting methods. The Meishan, Guanshan, and Penghua brigades, which have more mountain fields, based on the characteristics of high mountains, cold water, low temperatures, and thin soil, which require cultivation and topdressing, they all advocated using 5×4 cun dense planting; a part of the paddy fields in the Penghua Brigade need to be intercropped, and it was decided to use 7×4 cun dense planting. Third, there are also some special fields in the plain fields and mountain fields, and the dense planting specifications are also determined for each plot according to the actual possibilities. In addition, each team also determined different dense planting specifications according to the different varieties used for each plot of land.

After the cadres and the masses jointly discussed and formulated the dense planting specifications, everyone immediately took action to ensure the realization of this plan in all aspects. From the commune to the brigade and team, dense planting technology research institutions and leading organizations were established to guide production. The masses have high confidence and great enthusiasm in realizing this year's dense planting plan.

On March 7th, Fujian Daily published an editorial entitled "The Key to Promoting Dense Planting." The editorial excerpts are as follows:

Last year was the first year for Fujian Province to widely promote dense planting. Looking at the situation of rice dense planting in the province, although it was denser than in previous years, most of the fields were still not dense enough; as long as reasonable dense planting is adopted, significant increases in production can be obtained.

How can we further improve dense planting? In particular, how should the dense planting specifications be formulated? This is a common concern in further promoting dense planting. According to last year's experience, this cannot be solved by stipulating a general and uniform specification, but rather by emphasizing adapting to local conditions and ensuring that all kinds of fields can obtain reasonable and sufficient dense planting. Fields vary greatly, not only in soil and climate conditions between northern Fujian and southern Fujian, but even within a commune, mountain fields, semi-mountain fields, and plain fields often have differences; similarly, in plain fields, there are differences between paddy fields and dry fields, and differences in the depth of mature soil; in addition, various fields have different fertilizers, varieties, and so on. The differences in land, season, fertilizer, varieties, etc., form the differences in crop growth. They are opposite and complementary to each other. Only by paying attention to these differences, taking care of these differences, and determining plans and measures based on these differences can we achieve the requirements of comprehensive and large-scale production increase. The Five-Star Commune in Nan'an County has formulated various dense planting specifications for different fields based on the spirit of adapting to local conditions and adapting to varieties, and their approach is completely correct. In addition, when stipulating dense planting specifications based on local conditions, further unified consideration should be given to the quantity and quality of dense planting. That is to say, do not only stop at limiting a few cun by a few cun, and how many plants and ears are planted per mu, but also consider how many effective tillers can be obtained, and how to ensure that the ears are thick and strong, and the ears are large and the grains are plump. Because under the same dense planting conditions, if there are few tillers and the ears are small and the grains are thin, it will reduce the yield and weaken the significance of dense planting for increasing production. Therefore, we must pay attention to solving a series of problems surrounding dense planting while determining dense planting specifications, in order to guarantee increased production through dense planting.

    五星公社总结去年增产经验
    因地制宜确定水稻密植规格
    福建日报以“推行密植的关键所在”为题发表社论
    本报福州13日电　福建南安县诗山乡五星公社运用去年密植增产的经验，与群众共同讨论，因地制宜地订出了水稻密植规格。
    诗山乡五星公社去年获得空前丰收，变历史上缺粮乡为余米乡。群众在总结去年增产的经验时，认为除了水利、肥料等增产措施外，密植是增产的重要关键之一；但是密植一定要根据不同的生产条件，采取不同程度的密植，绝不是越密越好。美山大队去年许多山田都是下三百三十多担土杂肥，采用“红米早”稻种，但采用5×3寸密植的（即行距五寸，株距三寸），比采用5×2寸密植的，每亩多收一百斤；比5×4寸的多收五十斤。溅晞大队去年一千多亩山田多数是采用5×2寸密植，只有少数采用5×3寸、4×4寸密植，收割时5×2寸的山田比1957年稀植大大增产，但比5×3寸、4×4寸的密植田每亩少收二百多斤。许多社员在讨论中还认为，密植还要和肥料、种子和改良土壤等增产措施配合，不能孤立地研究密植。
    在总结去年密植经验的基础上，经过群众的讨论，根据因地制宜的原则，订出了今年全社的密植方案。第一，平原洋田大多采用5×2寸，一部分采用5×3寸，每丛插秧八到十株。根据金淘、山头、马头等平原洋田较多的大队的群众分析：平原洋田一般较肥沃、水利好、气候温暖，插秧应该密些，株数多些；只要注意了空气流通和中耕除草等工作，保证可以增产。第二，山田和半山田，一般采用5×4寸，有的也采用5×3寸和7×4寸的密植法。山田较多的美山、观山、蓬华等大队，根据山高水冷、气温低和土壤较瘦薄，需要中耕、追肥的特点，他们都主张采用5×4寸密植；蓬华大队一部分水田，需要种间作，决定采用7×4寸密植。第三，平洋田和山田中还有一些特殊田，也逐丘根据实际可能，确定了密植规格。此外，各个队还根据各丘土地采用不同品种而确定了不同的密植规格。
    干部和群众共同讨论订出了密植的规格后，大家立即行动，从各方面来保证实现这个规划。从公社到大队、小队，分别成立了密植技术研究机构和领导机构，指导生产。群众对实现今年的密植规划的信心很高、干劲很足。
    3月7日，福建日报以“推行密植的关键所在”为题发表社论。社论摘要如下：
    去年是福建省广泛推行密植的头一年。就全省水稻密植的情况看，虽然较前几年密了一些，但很大部分田地还是密得不够；只要是采用合理密植的，就能获得显著增产。
    怎样才能进一步搞好密植？特别是密植规格应当怎样制定？这是进一步推行密植中人们普遍关心的问题。根据去年的经验，这不能靠规定一个笼统的划一的规格来解决，而要强调因地制宜，保证各种田地都能得到合理的和足够的密植。田地有千差万别，不仅闽北和闽南的土壤气候条件不同，即使在一个公社里，往往山田、半山田和洋田也各有差别；同样在洋田中，水旱田地有差别，熟土深浅有差别；另外，各种田地施肥、品种等也都有所不同。土地、季节、肥料、品种等等的差别，形成了庄稼成长的差别。它们相反又相成，只有重视了这些差别，照顾到这些差别，根据这些差别确定方案和措施，才能实现全面大增产的要求。南安县五星公社正是根据因地制宜、因种制宜的精神，订出了不同田地的各种密植的规格，他们的这种作法是完全正确的。另外，在因地制宜规定密植规格的时候，还应当进一步对密植的数量和质量作统一的考虑。也就是说，不要只停留在限定几寸乘几寸，和亩插几株几穗上，还要考虑到能有多少有效分蘖，如何保证穗粗枝壮，穗大粒肥等问题。因为在同样密植的情况下，如果分蘖少，穗小粒瘦，就会减少产量，削弱了密植增产的意义。因此，我们必须在确定密植规格的同时，注意解决围绕密植的一系列问题，才能保证密植增产。
