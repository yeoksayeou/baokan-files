    Discussions of Soviet Scholars on the Problem of Socialist Commodity Production

    The Soviet economic circles have been conducting a long-term discussion on the issue of commodity production under the socialist system, and this discussion has been going on fervently recently. Except for a few scholars who deny the existence of commodity production in socialist society, the vast majority of scholars believe that commodity production exists. However, there are different views on the reasons for the existence of socialist commodity production and whether the means of production are commodities.

    Most economists, including Ostrovityanov, believe that the reasons for the existence of socialist commodity production are the division of labor between urban and rural areas and the coexistence of two forms of public ownership. Some also believe that the coexistence of two ownership systems is the only reason. Regarding whether the means of production are commodities, Ostrovityanov believes that the socialist economy is a unified whole, in which industry and agriculture, the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods are interrelated and interdependent. The means of production are used to produce consumer goods, the value of the means of production is transferred to the value of consumer goods, and the value of consumer goods also affects the actual wage level of workers and staff in the means of production sector. Therefore, the means of production have the nature of commodities. He believes that there is a commodity-money relationship between state-owned enterprises, but in order to show the difference between the two types of commodities, means of production and consumer goods, he advocates calling the means of production circulating between state-owned enterprises "special commodities," and this circulation is different from general commodity exchange. Some people believe that there is no commodity-money relationship within state-owned enterprises, and some people believe that the means of production are commodities with only control, management, and use rights, but no ownership. In addition, individual scholars, starting from the fact that the exchange results do not change ownership, propose that the means of production have value but are not commodities.

    Other scholars believe that the difference in the nature of labor in socialist society is the reason for the existence of commodity production. There are various opinions in this regard. There are mainly two representative opinions. One opinion explains the reasons for the existence of commodity production from the different degrees of socialization of labor. For example, Ya. Kolonglond believes that the public ownership of the means of production makes the labor of workers and collective farm members directly social, but because the level of productive forces is not high enough in the socialist stage, labor still has differences, so there must be material incentives and equivalent compensation for labor consumption, and there must also be contradictions between the total labor used for the entire social production and the individual concrete labor used for the production of each socialist enterprise. This determines that products must be transformed into average social labor of equal social nature through exchange with equivalent compensation, so the product becomes a commodity. Therefore, he also believes that there is a commodity-money relationship within the state-owned economy and that the means of production are commodities. Another opinion explains the necessity of commodity production from the fact that labor is not yet the primary need of life in the socialist stage. They believe that labor is not yet communist in nature, and it is necessary to calculate the value of labor products, implement the principle of material interests, and believe that the two forms of public ownership can only determine the nature of commodity production, but cannot determine its necessity.

    Another approach is to integrate various different viewpoints, that is, to believe that the reasons for the existence of commodities under the socialist system are not only the two forms of public ownership and the difference in the nature of labor, but even material incentives and economic accounting. This view was criticized as an eclectic view in the discussion.

### 苏联学者关于社会主义商品生产问题的讨论

    苏联学者关于社会主义商品生产问题的讨论
    关于社会主义制度下的商品生产问题，苏联经济学界已进行了长时期的讨论，这个讨论，最近还在热烈地进行着。除少数学者否认社会主义社会有商品生产外，绝大多数学者都认为有商品生产存在，至于社会主义商品生产存在的原因和生产资料是不是商品的问题，则存在着不同的看法。
    奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫等大多数经济学者认为社会主义商品生产存在的原因是城乡之间的分工和两种公有制并存。也有人认为两种所有制并存是唯一的原因。关于生产资料是不是商品的问题，奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫认为，社会主义经济是一个统一的整体，其中工业和农业、生产资料的生产和消费品的生产是相互联系，相互依存的。生产资料等是用来生产消费品的，生产资料的价值被转移到消费品的价值中，消费品的价值也对生产资料部门的工人和职员的实际工资水平有影响。因而生产资料具有商品的性质。他认为国营企业间存在商品货币关系，但为了表明生产资料和消费品这两种商品的区别，他主张把国营企业间流转的生产资料称为“特殊的商品”，而且这种流转和一般商品交换有区别。有人认为国营内部不存在商品货币关系，有人认为生产资料是只有支配、管理、使用，而没有所有权的商品。此外还有个别学者从交换结果不变更所有权出发，提出生产资料具有价值但不是商品的主张。
    另一些学者认为，社会主义社会中劳动性质的差别是商品生产存在的原因。这方面的意见是多种多样的。主要有两种代表性的意见，一种意见是从劳动的社会化程度不同来说明商品生产存在的原因。如雅·科龙隆德认为，生产资料的公有制使工人和集体农庄庄员的劳动具有直接的社会性，但由于社会主义阶段生产力水平还不高，劳动还具有差别，所以必须有物质刺激和对劳动消耗的等价补偿，同时也必然存在用于整个社会生产的总劳动和用于各社会主义企业生产的个别具体劳动之间的矛盾。这就决定了产品必须通过等价补偿的交换而把社会性质不同的劳动转化为社会性质均等的平均社会劳动，因而产品就成为商品。从而，他也认为国营经济内部存在商品货币关系和生产资料是商品。另一种意见是从社会主义阶段中劳动还不是生活的第一需要来说明商品生产的必要性。他们认为劳动还不是共产主义性质的，还需要计算劳动产品的价值，贯彻物质利益原则，并认为两种公有制只能决定商品生产的性质，不能决定其必要性。
    另一种是把各种不同观点融合起来，即认为社会主义制度下商品存在的原因，不仅是两种公有制形式，劳动性质的差别，甚至物质鼓励和经济核算等都是。这种观点在讨论中被指责为折衷主义的观点。
