Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Recently, various units of the central state organs have transferred more than six thousand nine hundred cadres to people's communes and factories and mines in twenty-six provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities for labor tempering. The vast majority of them were sent to rural people's communes. Currently, more than six hundred and fifty cadres dispatched by ten units, including the Supreme People's Court, have successively arrived at their labor posts; the remaining cadres designated for dispatch by other units will also depart in the next few days.

Among the cadres dispatched by various units of the central state organs this year, leading cadres at all levels and Party and League members account for a large proportion. Among the cadres dispatched by the Supreme People's Court, the Ministry of Justice, and other units, section-level cadres account for 27.5%, and Party and League members account for 72.5%. The Ministry of Culture has transferred two hundred and three cadres this year, of which bureau, section, and division-level cadres account for 26.2%, and Party and League members account for 46.5%. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also dispatched a group of engineering and technical personnel for labor tempering.

Before dispatching the cadres, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs convened a meeting of responsible persons of the Party committees of various units on February 27 to review the situation of cadres dispatched by the Central State Organs for labor tempering last year, and at the same time made arrangements for this year's work of dispatching cadres. After the responsible persons of the Party committees of various units made mobilization reports, the cadres wrote big-character posters and applications asking to be sent down. Many cadres stated in their applications that they would closely contact the masses, conscientiously transform their thinking and work style, and achieve being both red and expert in the process of labor tempering.

While studying and determining the list of cadres to be dispatched this year, various units also made comprehensive arrangements for all cadres who need to be sent down for labor tempering, planning to dispatch them in batches over the next few years.

    在劳动中同工农打成一片
    中央国家机关抽调近七千干部下放锻炼
    新华社15日讯　中央国家机关各单位最近抽调六千九百多名干部，分别下放到二十六个省（区）、市的人民公社和厂矿进行劳动锻炼。其中绝大部分是下放到农村人民公社。目前，最高人民法院等十个单位下放的六百五十多名干部，已经陆续到达劳动岗位；其余各单位决定下放的干部也将在最近几天内出发。
    今年中央国家机关各单位抽调下放的干部中，各级领导干部和党、团员占了很大比重。最高人民法院、司法部等单位下放的干部中，处、科级干部占27.5％，党团员占72.5％。文化部今年抽调二百零三名干部下放，其中局、处、科级干部占26.2％，党、团员占46.5％。冶金部还抽调一批工程技术人员下放劳动锻炼。
    在抽调干部下放以前，中央国家机关党委曾在2月27日召开了各单位党委负责人会议，对去年中央国家机关抽调干部下放劳动锻炼的情况进行了检查，同时对今年的下放干部工作进行了部署。各单位的干部在党委负责人作了动员报告以后，纷纷写大字报和申请书要求下放，许多干部在申请书中表示，要在劳动锻炼过程中密切联系群众，认真改造自己的思想和作风，做到红透专深。
    各单位在研究和确定今年下放干部名单的同时，还对所有需要下放劳动锻炼的干部作了全面安排，计划在今后几年内分批下放。
