Shandong, March 28th (Reported by this newspaper) - During the spring production campaign, various locations in Shandong have established extensive farm tool repair and manufacturing networks. Hundreds of thousands of blacksmiths and carpenters, combined with the efforts of all the people, have repaired and manufactured a large number of various types of farm tools for accumulating and transporting fertilizer, managing wheat fields, and spring plowing production. According to incomplete statistics from forty-six counties, 320,000 pieces of plows, harrows, drills, carts, fertilizer-making equipment, and other items have been manufactured; 1,500,000 pieces of double-shared plows, rope-traction plows, large and small vehicles, water-lifting tools, and other items have been repaired; and more than 500,000 small farm tools such as mattocks, shovels, and hoes have been repaired. The manufacturing and repair tasks for all kinds of farm tools needed for spring production throughout the province can be completed by the end of February.

Since last winter, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province have included the task of inspecting and repairing farm tools as an important item. After communization, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee promptly recognized the importance of addressing the shortage of farm tools and the need to vigorously repair and transform them, brought about by the large-scale liberation of women's labor, the unprecedented expansion of the labor force, and the enormous changes in production conditions. Therefore, it issued special instructions. Various counties also held several telephone conferences and broadcast meetings to mobilize the masses. At the same time, most counties also convened meetings of commune secretaries, industrial ministers, construction and repair factory directors, and waste product recycling station chiefs to specifically deploy and study the situation. They also clarified that the current production focus of township and commune industries should be serving spring production, mobilizing the industrial strength of townships and communes to rush-produce and repair various farm tools needed for spring plowing. Now, generally, each county has a factory in the commune, a station in the management district, and a mobile repair team in the production team, forming an extensive farm tool repair and manufacturing network throughout Shandong. The farm tool repair and manufacturing network offers five major conveniences: convenient repairs for damaged tools; convenient technical exchanges; convenient research and improvement; convenient leadership and planning by the Party; and economical use of raw materials. In order to expand the technical workforce and improve repair quality, some areas have also adopted measures such as "excavating, releasing, cultivating, and guiding" to train a large number of farm tool repair technicians. Yiyuan County transferred a group of iron and woodworkers with higher skills from the county iron and wood factory to the communes, using the method of master teaching apprentice to train a large number of farm tool repairers. In some areas, commune industrial ministers, construction and repair factory directors, and other leaders personally led technicians to conduct inspections, on-site visits, and disseminate experiences. Everyone learns, everyone appraises, combining manufacturing with repair and reform with promotion.

In terms of raw material supply, various regions adopted the method of self-reliance, using local materials, relying on the masses, and supplementing with strong support from commercial departments to solve the problem. Many areas also organized farm tool general survey teams to inspect a large number of farm tools, which could be used with slight repairs.

Through this massive upsurge in rush-manufacturing and repairing farm tools, the people's communes in Shandong have further established the enthusiasm of the broad masses for cherishing farm tools. Various regions have universally established and improved farm tool management systems, and divided management responsibilities.

Fuzhou, March 28th (Reported by this newspaper) - Various regions in Fujian Province are generally adopting a combination of professional forces and mass movements to carry out the tool reform movement, rushing to produce and repair a large number of farm tools for spring plowing production. According to statistics up to the 15th, the province has promoted more than 290,000 pieces of rope-traction machines, deep plowing plows, sowing machines, and other major farm tools needed for spring plowing. Various regions have also rushed to produce and repair a large number of small farm tools, effectively promoting the development of spring plowing production.

Adopting a combination of professional forces and mass movements in the tool reform has made it relatively easy to solve the raw material and technical problems encountered. Over the past two months, the Nanping Special District has manufactured more than 110,000 pieces of various farm tools needed for spring plowing. Longxi Special District, where the spring plowing season is earlier, launched a mass tool reform movement. In just ten days of hard work, it rushed to produce and promote more than 20,000 pieces of new-style farm tools urgently needed for spring plowing, such as sowing machines. Shaowu, Minqing, and other counties created "ox-drawn trains" based on the characteristics of ox-drawn carts, with one ox capable of pulling six to eight small cart boxes, carrying a load of six to ten thousand catties.

Various counties have universally used methods such as master teaching apprentice, running commune member training classes, and sending commune members to other places to learn new farm tool manufacturing experiences to train a large number of technical forces. Longyan, Changting, Yongding, and other counties have also transferred more than 2,400 technicians to enrich the strength of farm tool factories and accelerate the rush production of farm tools.

During the tool reform movement, many people in various regions actively offered suggestions and materials. The wood materials offered by the people of Huitu Township alone are enough to manufacture more than 500 carts. The commercial department of Longyan County cleared out more than 60,000 pieces of old farm tools from the warehouse and distributed them to 28 farm tool factories for processing and repair to support spring plowing production. In addition to relevant departments actively organizing the supply of raw materials, various places used locally available materials or other substitutes to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials. For example, in many places in Longxi Special District, agave, bark, wild vines, and bamboo strips were used to replace hemp for making ropes, or fried iron was used to replace steel for manufacturing farm tools.

During the tool reform movement, all regions attached importance to identifying and promoting tools that are effective for current production. For example, the ox-drawn rice strip seeder created by the staff of the Zhangpu County Farm Tool Factory can sow 20 mu per day per machine, which is more than ten times more efficient than manual labor. The county Party committee immediately took this seeder to a county-wide leap forward conference of more than 1,000 people for on-site observation and evaluation, and promptly promoted more than 1,000 units.

While vigorously carrying out tool reform and rushing to produce a large number of farm tools for spring plowing, farm tool factories and professional teams in various regions also repaired a large number of small farm tools for communes. The Wuxing Commune in Nan'an County extracted about 10% of the labor force from the commune. According to their skills, they organized professional teams for bamboo, wood, ironware, and other tasks, and went to various production brigades and teams to rush-produce farm tools and repair them door-to-door. The farm tool factories of some people's communes in some counties also established repair stations in villages to inspect and repair farm tools on the spot.

    社办工业主要是为农业服务
    东各地形成农具修配制造网
    福建加速赶制和修配春耕农具
    本报济南28日电　山东各地在春季生产运动中，建立了星罗棋布的农具修配制造网。数十万铁木工人结合全民动手，为积肥运肥、麦田管理、春耕生产修配制造了大批的各式各样的农具。据四十六个县的不完全统计，已赶制犁、耙、耧、小车、造肥器具等三十二万件；修配双铧犁、绳索牵引犁、大小车辆，提水工具等一百五十万件；镢、锨、锄等小农具五十多万件，全省在春季生产中所需用的各种农具的制造、修配任务，在2月底就可以全部完成。
    山东省各级党委从去冬以来，就把检查修制农具的任务，列为重要内容之一。中共山东省委在公社化以后，就及时觉察到妇女劳力的大批解放，劳动队伍的空前壮大，生产条件的巨大变化等情况所带来的农具缺乏以及需要大力修配改造的重要性，因此下达了专门指示，各县也召开了数次电话会、广播会，在群众中进行了发动，同时绝大部分县还召开了公社书记、工业部长、营造、修配厂长，废品收购站长等会议，专门进行部署研究，并且明确了当前乡社工业的生产重点应为春季生产服务，调动乡社工业力量，赶制修配春耕生产所需要的各种农具。现在一般县达到公社有厂，管理区有站，生产队有流动修配组，形成了一个遍布山东全境的星罗棋布的农具修配制造网。农具修配制造网有五大方便：损坏了修理方便；技术交流方便；研究提高方便；党领导规划方便；节约原材料。为了扩大技术队伍提高修配质量，有些地区还采取了“挖、放、培、带”等措施，训练了大批农具修配技术人材。沂源县从县铁木工厂抽调一批技术较高的铁、木工人，下放到公社，以师傅带徒弟的办法培养了大批农具修配员。有些地区的公社工业部长、营造、修配厂长等领导人员，亲自带领技术人员，巡回检查、现场参观，传播经验、大家学习，大家鉴定，使制造与修配、改革与推广相结合。
    在原料的供应方面，各地采取自力更生、就地取材，依靠群众辅之以商业部门大力支援的办法解决的。许多地区还组织农具普查大队，检查出大批农具来，只要略加修理就能应用。
    山东各地人民公社通过这次大量的赶制与修配农具的热潮，进一步树立了广大群众爱护农具的积极性，各地都普遍建立与健全了农具管理制度，划分了管理范围。

    本报福州28日电　福建省各地普遍采取专业力量与群众运动相结合，开展工具改革运动，为春耕生产赶制和修补大批农具。到15日止的统计，全省已推广绳索牵引机、深耕犁、播种机等春耕所需的主要农具二十九万多件，各地还赶制和修补了大批小农具，有力地推动了春耕生产的开展。
    在工具改革中采取专业力量与群众运动相结合，遇到的原料和技术问题都比较容易解决。南平专区二个多月来，已制造各种春耕所需的农具达十一万多件。春耕季节较早的龙溪专区在开展群众性工具改革运动中，仅苦战十天，就赶制和推广了春耕急需的播种机等新式农具二万多件，邵武、闽清等县根据牛拉车特点，创造“牛拉列车”，一只牛能带动六至八个小车箱，载重达六千至一万斤。
    各县普遍运用师傅带徒弟和开办社员训练班和派社员到外地学习新农具制造经验等方法培养大批技术力量。龙岩、长汀、永定等县还抽调二千四百多个技术员，充实农具厂力量，加速赶制农具。
    在工具改革运动中，不少地区的群众积极献策献料，仅汇土乡的群众献出的木料就可供制造五百多辆车子之用。龙岩县商业部门从仓库内清理出来六万多件旧农具，分配给二十八个农具厂加工修理，支援春耕生产。除有关部门积极组织原料供应外，地地都运用就地取材或用其他代用品来解决原料不足问题，如龙溪专区不少地方利用龙舌兰、树皮、野藤、竹篾等代替黄麻打绳子或用炒铁代替钢料制造农具。
    各地在工具改革运动中，都重视鉴定和推广对当前生产有效的工具。如漳浦县农具厂职工创造的牛拉水稻条播机，每台每天可播二十亩，比人力提高十多倍，该县县委即将这种播种机拿到一千多人的全县跃进大会上，进行现场观摩鉴定，及时推广一千多部。
    各地农具厂、专业队在大搞工具改革，为春耕赶制大批农具的同时，还为公社修补大量小农具。南安县五星公社抽出社内10％左右劳动力，根据各人的技能，组织竹、木、铁器等专业队，分头在各生产大队、小队赶制农具，并登门修补。有些县的人民公社的农具厂还以村庄建立修配站，就地检修农具。
