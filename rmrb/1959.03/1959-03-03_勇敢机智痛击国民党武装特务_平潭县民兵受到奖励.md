Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd: The Pingtan County militia, which dealt a head-on blow to Kuomintang armed agents in the Niushan Ocean Fishing Ground in Fujian Province last month, has recently been commended by the Pingtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Pingtan County People's Committee. Party and government organs of Pingtan County and representatives of the garrison also held a celebration meeting for the eight militiamen who performed meritorious service.

At noon on February 2nd, when twenty-three Kuomintang armed agents sneaked into the Niushan Ocean Fishing Ground by gunboat to plunder our fishing boats and fishermen, more than ten militiamen of this county immediately used machine guns and rifles to launch a fierce attack on the enemy gunboat from their two motorized sailing fishing boats. This won time for our People's Navy gunboat forces to arrive and sink the enemy boat in one fell swoop.

At the celebration meeting, Bai Huaicheng, First Secretary of the Pingtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also presented award banners on behalf of the Jinjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jinjiang Administrative Office, and the Jinjiang Military Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The militiamen who participated in this battle unanimously thanked the Party and the people for the honor bestowed upon them. They expressed that they will certainly unite all militiamen and fishermen, and under the leadership of the Party, continue to strengthen military training, heighten vigilance, and be ready at all times to cooperate with the garrison to inflict even heavier blows on any enemy who dares to invade.

    勇敢机智痛击国民党武装特务
    平潭县民兵受到奖励
    新华社福建前线2日电　上月2日在福建省牛山洋渔场给予国民党武装特务迎头痛击的平潭县民兵，最近受到中共平潭县委员会和平潭县人民委员会的奖励。平潭县党政机关和驻军代表还为立功的八名民兵开了庆功大会。
    上月2日中午，当二十三名国民党武装特务乘炮艇窜入牛山洋渔场劫掠我渔船、渔民时，这个县的十几个民兵立即在自己的两条机帆渔船上用机枪、步枪向敌人炮艇展开猛烈射击，赢得了时间，使我人民海军炮艇部队赶到，一举把敌艇击沉。
    在庆功大会上，中共平潭县委第一书记白怀成还代表中共晋江地委、晋江专署和中国人民解放军晋江军分区等单位发了奖旗。参加这次战斗的民兵一致感谢党和人民给他们的荣誉。他们表示一定团结全体民兵和渔民，在党的领导下，继续加强军事训练、提高警惕，随时准备配合驻军给予胆敢来犯的敌人以更沉重的打击。
