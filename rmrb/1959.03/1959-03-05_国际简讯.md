It was jointly organized by the federations of railway workers' unions participating in the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, "Workers' Force," the Independent Civil Servants' Union, and the General Confederation of Civil Servants.

	U.S. Launches Small Satellite
	Inglewood dispatch: The U.S. Air Force launched a small satellite "Discoverer I," weighing only forty pounds, at Vandenberg Base on the 1st.

However, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said that the true orbit is still to be further investigated. According to available material, this small satellite can only exist for about a month. It was sent into orbit by a multi-stage rocket weighing 100,000 pounds.

    美发射小卫星
    茵格伍德讯：美国空军1日在范登堡基地发射了一个只有四十磅重的小卫星“发现者一号”。卫星发射后，很长时间音讯全无，一直到三十二小时以后，才算收到了它发出的讯号。但是，美国空军发言人说，真正的轨道到底如何，还有待进一步的侦察。据现有材料推算，这个小卫星只能存在一个月左右。它是用一个十万磅重的多级火箭送进轨道的。
