Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Large-scale vegetable production activities have fully commenced in the suburbs of Beijing.

Currently, commune members in all people's communes are seizing the agricultural season to cultivate seedlings, select seeds, accumulate fertilizer, deliver manure, level land, and flatten new vegetable fields. They are also fertilizing overwintered windbreak crops, preparing to harrow the land to conserve moisture after the snow melts, and strengthening the management of greenhouses and hotbeds to increase the supply of early spring vegetables.

To ensure a balanced supply of various vegetables to the market, all communes have adopted staggered planting measures. You'anmen Station in Nan Yuan Commune plans to sow tomatoes in seven batches to extend the supply season. Yangbaicai (cabbage) in the Si Ji Qing Commune will be sown in four batches, ensuring that Yangbaicai will be available from May until winter this year. Currently, the seedlings of early-maturing open-field tomatoes, eggplants, green peppers, and other solanaceous vegetables have grown one or two true leaves and are generally very robust. Early-maturing Yangbaicai and cauliflower, sown after last autumn, have generally been transplanted after a winter of management, with the earlier ones having grown five to six leaves. Early-maturing cucumbers, zucchini, and other vegetables will also be cultivated and sown in batches.

Responding to the call of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to vigorously develop vegetable production, all people's communes have formulated plans to expand commercial vegetable production. Many areas plan to double or multiply their vegetable production. The Hongxing Commune in Daxing District plans to expand new vegetable fields by more than 12,000 mu, nearly doubling the vegetable field area compared to 1958, and will supply the city with 100 million jin of commercial vegetables throughout the year. Yongning Commune in Yanqing County, which grew very few vegetables last year, is also preparing to plant 50,000 mu of potatoes this year, followed by large radishes and Chinese cabbage, to increase the supply to the city. At present, all communes are actively preparing various means of production needed for the large-scale development of vegetable fields.

    京郊园圃新苗好
    预报今年蔬菜多
    新华社28日讯　北京郊区大规模的蔬菜生产活动已经全面展开。
    目前各人民公社的社员，正在抓紧农时进行育苗、选种、积肥、送粪、压地和平垫新菜田，给越冬的风障根茬菜施肥，并准备在雪溶化后耙地保墒，加强温室和阳畦生产的管理，以便增加早春蔬菜的供应。
    为了让各种蔬菜能够均衡地供应市场，各公社都采取了排开播种的措施。南苑公社右安门站准备分七期播种西红柿，延长供应季节；四季青公社的洋白菜要分四期播种，从5月起到今年冬天都将有洋白菜上市。现在露地早熟的西红柿、茄子、青椒等茄果类蔬菜的小苗都已生长一、二个真叶，一般长的都很壮实。去年秋后播种的早熟洋白菜、菜花，经过一冬的管理，一般都已进行了分苗，较早的已生长五至六个叶子。早熟黄瓜、西葫芦等也将分期育苗播种。
    各人民公社响应中共北京市委大力发展蔬菜生产的号召，都制定了扩大商品蔬菜生产计划，很多地区都计划一倍或几倍地发展蔬菜生产。大兴区红星公社计划扩大一万二千多亩新菜地，比1958年菜田面积增加将近两倍，全年将供应城市商品菜一亿斤。去年种菜很少的延庆县永宁公社，今年也准备种五万亩土豆，下茬再种大萝卜、大白菜，增加对城市的供应。目前各公社正在积极准备菜田大发展所需的各种生产资料。
