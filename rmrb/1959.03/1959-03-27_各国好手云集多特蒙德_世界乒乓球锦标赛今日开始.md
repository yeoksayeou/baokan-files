Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The long-awaited 25th World Table Tennis Championships are scheduled to open on the 27th in Dortmund, West Germany.

　　This year marks the grandest scale in the history of the World Table Tennis Championships. According to the latest news, more than 450 players from over 40 regions around the world will showcase their skills here. Due to the large number of players, men and women will gather at 24 tables every day for thirteen hours of competition throughout the ten-day event. They will compete for seven world titles: men's team, women's team, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.

　　The history of the World Table Tennis Championships is not very long. The first one was held in 1927, and since then, various countries have hosted it in turn every year, totaling 24 editions. After 1957, it was changed to be held every two years. In the men's team event of all previous competitions, the Hungarian team has been the most outstanding, winning the championship eleven times, accounting for almost half. Czechoslovakia is second with six wins, followed by Japan with four, and Austria, the United Kingdom, and the United States with one each. In the women's team event, Romania has the best record, winning the championship five times, Czechoslovakia four times, Japan three times, Germany and the United States twice each, and England once.

　　Hungary also holds the top position in the men's singles event, with a total of nine championships, followed by England with six, Japan with five, Czechoslovakia with three, and Austria with one.

　　Hungarian female players, like their male counterparts, have achieved the most outstanding results in the women's singles events of all previous competitions, winning a total of ten championships. Romania won six consecutive times, Czechoslovakia three times, Japan twice, and Austria and the United States once each. Hungary also has the best record in the remaining three events: men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, followed by Czechoslovakia and Romania.

　　This year, China has sent eight male players and three female players to participate in the competition. In recent years, the Chinese team has been attracting more and more attention. In 1956, China participated in the World Championships for the second time, with the men's team ranking sixth and the women's team ranking eleventh. Just one year later, in the competition held in Stockholm, both the Chinese men's and women's teams won their group championships. In the semi-finals, the men's team was defeated by Japan. The women's team lost only to Romania and Japan. In the nearly two years since the end of the championships, Chinese players have achieved good results in the Moscow international competition, in domestic competitions against foreign players, and in the friendly matches held during their recent visits to Hungary and the German Democratic Republic. There is reason to expect that the Chinese men's team will achieve good results. This year, the Chinese women's team is dramatically grouped with the English team again, which is the third encounter in the championships. In 1956, the Chinese team was defeated 1-3, and in 1957, the Chinese team defeated the English team 3-1 to win the group championship. This year, Haydon of the English team has performed very well, and it is estimated that the third encounter between these two teams will inevitably lead to fierce competition. According to the ranking, the Chinese men's team will play against Portugal and Australia on the first day, and the women's team will play against Spain and the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese men's and women's teams are the seeded teams in the second group for men and the first group for women, respectively. The sixteen members of the Chinese delegation arrived in Dortmund by train from the German Democratic Republic at 7:00 p.m. on the 24th. The leader of the delegation is Chen Xian, Chairman of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, and the deputy leader is Zhang Junhan.

    各国好手云集多特蒙德
    世界乒乓球锦标赛今日开始
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：人们等待已久的第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛定27日在西德的多特蒙德开幕。
    在世界乒乓球锦标赛的历史上，今年是规模最盛大的一次。据最新消息，来自世界各地的四十多个地区单位的四百五十多名选手将在这里一显身手。由于选手的人数多，所以在十天的比赛中，男女选手每天将聚集在二十四张桌子上，进行十三小时的比赛。他们将争夺男子团体，女子团体，男、女单打，男、女双打，男女混合双打等七项世界冠军。
    世界乒乓球锦标赛的历史还不太久，第一次是在1927年举行的，此后每年由各个国家轮流主办，到现在一共举行过二十四届。1957年后改为每两年举行一次。在历届比赛的男子团体赛中，匈牙利队成绩最为出色，获得十一次冠军，占了几乎一半。捷克斯洛伐克次之，获得六次，日本四次，奥地利、英国和美国各一次。女子团体赛中，罗马尼亚成绩最好，获得五次冠军，捷克斯洛伐克四次，日本三次，德、美各得两次，英格兰一次。
    历届中男子单打的成绩也是匈牙利占第一位，共得九次冠军，英国六次，日本五次，捷克斯洛伐克三次，奥地利一次。
    匈牙利的女子选手在历届单打比赛中，同匈牙利的男子选手一样获得了最杰出的成绩，她们一共得过十次冠军。罗马尼亚连得六次，捷克斯洛伐克三次，日本两次，奥地利和美国各一次。其余三项：男子双打、女子双打和男女混合双打也是匈牙利成绩最好，其次是捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚。
    我国今年派遣了八名男子选手和三名女子选手参加比赛。这几年来中国队正越来越引起人们的注意。1956年中国第二次参加世界锦标赛，男子就列第六名，女子列第十一名。只隔了一年工夫，在斯德哥尔摩举行的那届比赛中，中国男子和女子选手都获得了小组冠军。复赛中，男子队为日本所败。女子队仅败于罗马尼亚和日本队。锦标赛结束以来的近两年中，中国选手在莫斯科国际比赛，在国内同外国选手比赛以及最近访问匈牙利和德意志民主共和国时举行的友谊比赛中都获得了良好成绩。人们有理由可以期待中国队男子选手将取得良好的成绩。中国女子队今年同英格兰队戏剧性地又分在一组，这是锦标赛上第三次对垒了。1956年时中国队以一比三被击败，1957年中国队以三比一胜英格兰队而获得小组冠军。今年英格兰队的海顿表现很好，估计这两队三度相遇势必会出现剧烈的争夺。根据名次的排列，我国男子队将在第一天对葡萄牙队和澳大利亚队，女子队对西班牙队和德意志民主共和国队。我国男女两队分别是男子第二组和女子第一组的种子队。我国代表队一行十六人是在24日晚七时从德意志民主共和国乘火车到达多特蒙德的。代表队的领队是中国乒乓球协会主席陈先，副领队是张钧汉。
