"Old Red Banner" - Zhou Yougui
By our reporters Lu Yuker and Rui Yingjie

In Wuqing County, Hebei, if you ask anyone—adult or child—"Who is your 'Old Red Banner'?"—odds are, eight or nine out of ten will unhesitatingly tell you: "Zhou Yougui, of course!"

Zhou Yougui is a "Five-Good member" of the Laomidian Production Team in the Yangcun People's Commune. People call him "Old Red Banner" for two reasons: one, because he is getting on in years, almost sixty; and the other is because he is ideologically progressive and actively productive, always being at the forefront in both thought and production since joining the commune. A little over a month ago, the county committee launched a "Learn from Zhou Yougui" campaign among the masses throughout the county. His deeds have also spread throughout the county.

We had the opportunity to visit this ordinary commune member.

Carefully "Weaving" a Large "Carpet"

Starting from Yangcun and heading southwest for a dozen or so li, you can see a small house leaning against the embankment of a tributary of the Yongding River. Zhou Yougui and his partner Yang Yufa live there. Below the house is the forty mu of wheat field that they are responsible for. Before we set out, Comrade Li Xueyu, the secretary of the commune party committee, told us that the two of them had moved to the field after last autumn. That was when the wheat had just been sown. Zhou Yougui had requested the party branch secretary of the production team, Yang Zhenwu, several times, saying: "Let me 'specialize' in a piece of land and guarantee I will manage it well." The branch secretary, seeing his enthusiasm, agreed. The old man was very happy. He and another commune member, Yang Yufa, discussed it and immediately found sticks, poles, and sorghum stalks. They dug ditches and mixed mud on the slope next to the wheat field. In two evenings, they built the framework of the small house. The small house also had inner and outer rooms. The inner room had a stove, and the doors and windows were all brought by Zhou Yougui from his home. The outer room was not big and was filled with manure baskets, manure cans, rakes, small hoes..., looking like a small warehouse. From that day on, they ate and lived here, staying in the wheat field day and night.

Their care for the wheat seedlings is truly meticulous. For example, when rolling the wheat, others used stone rollers, but they did not. He told the branch secretary that it was because there were few livestock that they didn't use them, but he also had another reason: he was afraid the livestock would trample the wheat. They had discussed it: This year, the wheat is so dense that you can't step into it, and the soil is so loose. Trampling a wheat seedling would mean losing forty or fifty grains of wheat. We can't let the livestock into the field! But how to roll it? They had a carpenter make two large elm wood shafts, one for each person, and they pushed them to roll. Aren't wood shafts lighter than stone rollers? So they rolled back and forth, rolling vertically and horizontally. After rolling it once, they started over. Others had just finished rolling it once, but they had already rolled it three times. These two people spent the whole day in the wheat field, "weaving" this forty-mu large "carpet."

Lofty Ideals, Stubborn Character

It was probably around the "Minor Snow" solar term when the squad leader Wang Zhongqi drove a large cart past here. Zhou Yougui was not feeling well. The squad leader wanted him to go back home with the cart to rest for a few days. Guess what he said? "Wheat is me, and I am wheat. A small illness is nothing." He refused to go back no matter what. The branch secretary Yang Zhenwu also came to see him that day, saying, "You are old, and the weather is so cold. The branch has decided to let you go home." Zhou Yougui still said the same thing: "Wheat is me, and I am wheat." Yang Yufa also chimed in, "We discussed it long ago. We won't go back until the wheat is harvested." The branch secretary knew the old man's temperament best: straightforward and not willing to admit he was old. Coercion wouldn't work. The next day, Yang Zhenwu finally came up with an idea and said, "From tomorrow onwards, our team will be harvesting reeds. It will take half a month to finish. We can't do without your two old hands! You have to go back." The old man thought: That's right, these two thousand mu of reeds are the team's "big autumn" harvest. We can't ruin it. It's good to get it home early. Only then did he pack up his bedding and go home.

Did you think they would ignore the wheat while harvesting reeds at home? No. The two of them got up at cockcrow every day, each carrying a small manure basket, searching for manure along the streets while walking towards the wheat field. Every day, as soon as the sun turned red, the two of them would arrive at the field with two baskets of manure, immediately circling the wheat ridges, afraid that something might have gone wrong with the wheat in one day and one night. After seeing that everything was fine, they felt relieved, carried their manure baskets back home, ate breakfast, and then went straight to the reed field with their sickles.

These two were indeed "capable" when it came to harvesting reeds. Others could harvest at most one or two mu a day, but they could both harvest two or two and a half mu. Not only did they harvest more, but they also harvested well. The reed field harvested by Zhou Yougui was so flat that you wouldn't feel any prickles even if you walked in barefoot - the remaining reed stubble was as level as the ground. This was partly because he cherished the public property of the commune from the bottom of his heart, and he wouldn't feel comfortable throwing anything away; and partly because he was good at his work. He had been a long-term laborer for landlords since he was sixteen years old until the year before liberation. The old society exploited all his youthful energy, leaving him with a stubborn character, a pair of calloused hands, and a set of good skills. He could weave nets at night without turning on the light, faster and better than you could with a light. Not only that, but he didn't wear a straw hat in the summer or a cotton hat in the winter... He was like an iron Arhat from head to toe. In the old society, he often thought: With my iron hands and feet, why can't I find a way out?

His way out was found after liberation. Only then did he unleash all his skills. He often told people: "Don't mention the first half of my life; in the second half, I have to give all my energy to socialism." With this lofty ideal, coupled with his good skills, he would do everything better than others. If anyone surpassed him in anything, whether it was ideology or production, he would desperately try to catch up. Last autumn, when sowing winter wheat, Wang Zhongwen, Wang Zhongfa, and two others sowed fourteen mu and seven fen in one day, one mu more than the team's target. The production team awarded them a red banner. When Zhou Yougui heard about it, he became anxious and insisted on competing for the red banner. That night, he found Yang Yufa, Hu Zhendong, and Wu Guangling, and they put together a seed drill and discussed competing with Wang Zhongwen and the others the next day. He didn't sleep well that night, smoking a whole pack of old cigarettes, figuring out how to sow quickly and well, and how to surpass them. He woke everyone up before dawn. In the field, he rushed to drive the oxen, Yang Yufa held the drill, and the remaining two pulled the ropes. They didn't stop all day, and Zhou Yougui kept turning around to tell Yang Yufa: "Pay attention, ten furrows in one ridge. Don't just focus on speed and sow too sparsely!" Yang Yufa laughed at the old man's seriousness: "This young man (that's what he always called him) is really working hard." Zhou Yougui said: "Sowing one day earlier means harvesting ten days earlier. If we finish sowing early, won't we be more confident of a good harvest!" So they worked until dark, and when they measured it, they had sown a full nineteen mu and three fen. Altogether, they had walked one hundred and thirty li that day, not counting the turns. The speed of pulling the drill was almost like a forced march. The next day, the red banner was awarded to their seed drill, and the old man was happy.

Communist Style

But don't misunderstand that the old man was engaging in individual heroism. When others were not as good as him, whether in ideology or production, he would not rest until he helped them catch up. He had a saying: Relying on me alone, no matter how capable I am, I can't run the large commune well or build socialism. Next to the wheat field he managed was a hundred mu of wheat field managed by commune members Lan Wanhua and ten others from the third squad. The wheat seedlings were yellow and green, of different heights. One day, Zhou Yougui took the initiative to find them, helping them inspect and study the wheat ridge by ridge, identifying their management problems, mainly poor rolling and uneven fertilization. Afterwards, he held a discussion with them, sharing his experiences without reservation, and led them to visit his forty-mu wheat field. Lan Wanhua and the others were deeply moved by the old man's enthusiasm. They said, "Old Uncle Zhou, don't worry, we will use your experience to catch up with you!" Zhou Yougui laughed and said, "Good, I hope you catch up, and we will strive for a bumper harvest together!" Since then, Lan Wanhua and the others have managed their wheat much more carefully than before. They also sifted manure! They also used the large wood shafts to roll back and forth. The hundred mu of wheat field was visibly improving.

When we visited him, he and Yang Yufa had already moved back to that small house. They were spending the whole day in the field again, watering the wheat at the jointing stage and applying fertilizer. The sorghum shed in front of the house was full of small ash, all of which had been transported by them, one trip at a time, pulling the cart. The four thousand catties of "anti-lodging agent" allocated to them by the fertilizer factory were transported without using a single animal. Zhou Yougui pointed to the small ash and the anti-lodging agent and said: "We will start spreading it tomorrow. This thing is good. The wheat in the Yongding River bend has had reduced yields every year because of lodging. This year, we are preparing for it in advance. Aren't both of these potassium fertilizers?" Zhou Yougui pointed to the wheat field on the slope and also told us that he had counted all the wheat plants, and the minimum number of plants per mu was one million two hundred thousand. The seeds were all Bima No. 1. If each plant produces forty grains, we can harvest three thousand catties with certainty. The old man's expression when calculating was full of confidence. But he added: "We can't relax! Isn't that right? We two brothers are here to hold the line. We won't go home until the wheat is ripe." Saying this, the old man took two steps forward, facing us closely, and said in a low but joyful voice: "I am a party member. I joined the party not many days after the commune was established. That day, I raised my arm and shouted: I want to fight for communism. Tell me, wouldn't it be failing the party if I didn't sell my old bones?"

When we shook hands to say goodbye to this old man, we saw the red "Five-Good Commune Member" badge he was wearing, shining brightly. Throughout the province and the country, there must be countless people like Zhou Yougui, striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, working day and night selflessly and diligently on all fronts of socialist construction. Let us wish Zhou Yougui, Yang Yufa, and all such people victory - the greatest victory! (Attached picture)

    “老红旗”——周友桂
    本报记者　卢玉珂　芮英杰
    在河北武清县，你随便问一个人——不管是大人小孩：你们的“老红旗”是谁？保险，十有八九都会毫不犹豫地告诉你：“周友桂”呗！”
    周友桂是杨村人民公社老米店生产队的一个“五好社员”。人们称他是“老红旗”有两个含义：一个是因为他上了点年纪，快六十了；另一个则是因为他思想进步，生产积极，从入社后，思想、生产总是占上游。前一个多月，县委曾经在全县的群众中开展了一次“学习周友桂”的运动。他那事迹，也就在全县传开了。
    我们有机会访问了这位普普通通的老社员。
    精心“编织”大“地毯”
    从杨村出发，往西南走十几里，远远就看见依傍在永定河支流堤埝上的一间小房，周友桂和他的伙伴杨玉发就住在那里。那房子的下边，就是他们包管的四十亩麦田。出发前，公社党委书记李学余同志介绍过：他们俩从去年秋后就搬到地里住了。那是麦子刚种完的时候，周友桂向生产队党支部书记杨振武要求好几次，他说：让我“专”起一块来吧，保证把它管得很好。支部书记看着他这股劲头，答应了。老头可高兴了。他，还有另外一个社员杨玉发，两个人一商量，当天就找来了棍子、棒子、秫秸，在麦地旁边的道坡上，刨沟的刨沟，和泥的和泥，两个晚上就把小屋支架起来了。这小屋还有里外间，里间有锅灶，门窗都是周友桂打家拿来的，外间不大，堆满了粪筐、粪罐、钉耙、小锄……，活像个小仓库。打那天，他们就在这儿吃、这儿住，黑夜白天长在麦地里。
    他们对麦苗的爱护真是无微不至。比如轧麦吧，别人都使石磙，他俩不使，他跟支部书记说是牲口少他们不使，其实还有一个心思，是怕牲口踩麦子。他俩商量过：今年这麦子插不下脚的那么密，地又这么“宣”，踩坏一棵麦苗，就是四五十粒麦子。不能叫牲口进地！可怎么轧呢？他们让木匠给做了两个大榆木轴，一人一个，人推着轧，木轴不是比石磙轻吗？他们就来回的轧，竖轧了横轧，轧完一遍又打头来，别人刚轧完一遍，他们早就轧三遍了。这两个人，就是这样，整天长在麦田里，“编织”着这块四十亩的大“地毯”。
    崇高的思想倔强的性格
    大概是接近“小雪”节的一天，分队长王仲起赶着大车由这儿过，周友桂正有点不舒服。队长想让他跟着车回去养几天。你猜他说什么？“麦子就是我，我就是麦子，闹个小病，算不了甚么。”说什么也不回去。支部书记杨振武当天也找他来了，说你们岁数大啦，天又这么冷，支部决定叫你们回家。周友桂还是那句话：
  “麦子就是我，我就是麦子。”杨玉发在一边也插了一句：“我们早商量好了，麦子不收，不回去。”支部书记最清楚这老头的脾气：直性子，不服老。来硬的算不行。第二天，杨振武好容易想出个办法，找来说：“从明天起，咱们队上打苇子，半月打完，缺你们这两把老手，可不行啊！得回去。”老头一想：是啊，这两千多亩苇子是队上的个“大秋”，那可不能糟踏了，早收到家来也好。这才算卷着被窝回家去。
    你以为他们在家打苇子就不管麦子了吗？不。这两个人每天鸡叫就起来了，一人背一个小粪筐，顺着街道，一边寻摸着粪，一边往麦地那边走。每天太阳一露红，两人背着两筐粪准到地头上，倒下粪赶忙围着麦畦转几个圈，生怕一天一夜的工夫，麦子出了毛病。一看没事，才放了心，背着粪筐就又往家返，吃完了早饭，一转身就又拿着镰刀直奔苇子地。
    这俩人打苇子也确实是“干将”。别人一天顶多打一亩二，可是他们俩都能够打到二亩、二亩二。不光打得多，还打得好。周友桂打过的苇子地，你光着脚进去也不扎的慌——留下的苇茬跟地一般平。这，一来是他打心眼里珍惜公社的财产，扔一点也不舒心；二来也是他的活计好。他十六岁就给地主扛长工，一直到解放的前一年。旧社会剥削去了他年青的全部精力，给他剩下的却是一派倔强的性格、一手茧子、一身好活计。他晚上织网可以不点灯，比你有灯织的还快还好。不但是这个，他夏天不戴草帽子，冬天不戴棉帽子，……浑身上下，活像个铁罗汉。在旧社会，他常这样想：就凭我周友桂这铁手铁脚，为什么就踩躂不出个活路来。
    他的活路在解放以后算找到了，他这才算把一身的本事，使劲地施展开了。他常跟人们说：“前半辈，就甭提了；后半辈，我得把这股子劲全使给社会主义。”有了这崇高的思想，再加上他那身好本事，干起什么活来都要强要好。要是有哪个人在哪个事上超过了他，他非拼命的赶上去不可。去年秋天种冬小麦，王仲文、王仲发等四个人一张耧，一天耩了十四亩七，比队里规定的指标多一亩多，生产队给他们插了红旗，周友桂一听说，着急了，非争这面红旗不行。当晚他就找了杨玉发、胡振山、吴广岭四个人，也凑上了一张耧，商量好了第二天就跟王仲文他们赛。这一晚上他算没睡好觉，整整抽了一盒老烟，琢磨怎么耩的快又耩的好，赶过他们去。天不亮他就把人们喊起来了。到地里，他抢着驾辕，杨玉发扶耧，剩下的那两人拉帮套。这一天他们都没住脚，周友桂还老是回头嘱咐杨玉发：注点意，一个畦十个垅，光顾快，耩稀了可不行！杨玉发看着这老头子的认真劲，也乐了：这小伙子（他总是这么称呼他）真拼命啦。周友桂说：“早种一天早收十天，早种完了，丰收不就有把握了吗！”就这样，一直干到天黑，量了量，整整十九亩三。一合算，不算拐弯，这一天他们整走了一百三十里地。那拉耧的速度，差点赶上急行军。第二天，红旗就插到了他们这张耧上，老头乐了。
    共产主义的风格
    但你可不要误会这老头是在闹个人英雄主义，当别人不如他的时候，不管是思想也好，生产也好，他不设法帮助你赶上来决不死心。他有个说道：指着我一个人，天大的本事也搞不好大公社，也建不成社会主义。在他管理的麦地旁边，是三分队社员蓝万华等十个人包管的一百亩麦田。那麦苗有黄有绿，高矮不齐。有一天，周友桂主动地找到他们几个人，帮他们一个畦一个畦的检查、研究，找出他们管理上的毛病主要是轧耙不好、施肥不匀。之后，又跟他们座谈，把自己的经验一股脑地端给了他们，并且领着他们参观了他那四十亩麦田。蓝万华他们几个一看老头子这股子劲，深深地感动了，他们说：“周老大爷，你放心吧，我们就使你的经验赶你！”周友桂哈哈大笑说：“好，盼着你们赶上来，咱们一齐争取大丰收！”这以后，蓝万华他们对小麦的管理比先前精细得多了，也筛粪！也使那大木轴来回的老轧，那一百亩麦田眼看好转了。
    当我们访问他的时候，他和杨玉发早就又搬回那小房子来了。又是整天长在地里，浇拔节水、施拔节肥。房子前边那秫秸棚子里，小灰都装满啦，这都是他俩一趟一趟人拉车运来的，化肥厂拨给他们的四千斤“防伏剂”，也没用一个牲口毛儿，周友桂指着那小灰和防伏剂说：“明儿个我们就开撒，这玩意儿可是好东西。永定河套这麦子，年年都因为倒伏减收成，今年我们提早防备它，这两样不都是钾肥吗？”周友桂指着下坡的麦田还告诉我们，说这麦子他全数过来啦，顶少的一亩也有一百二十万株，种子都是碧蚂一号，一棵按长四十个粒，收它个三千斤手拿把攥。看老头算账时的那神情，真是一百个信心。可是他呆会儿又说：“也不能松劲啊！这不是？我们哥俩又来顶着了，麦子不熟，说啥也不回家。”说到这儿，老头儿往前走了两步，紧对着我们的面，小声地、可又那么高兴地说：“我是个党员，就是成立公社以后不多几天入党的，那天，我举着胳膊喊：要为共产主义奋斗，你说，不卖卖老对得起党吗？”
    当我们握手道别这位老人的时候，我们看到他佩戴的那红色的“五好社员”的胸章，闪烁着光芒。在全省、在全国，该有多少像周友桂这样的人们，在争取1959年更大更好更全面地跃进中，在建设社会主义的各个战线上，日夜辛勤、忘我为公的劳动着。让我们预祝周友桂、杨玉发和所有这样的人们，取得胜利——最大的胜利。（附图片）
