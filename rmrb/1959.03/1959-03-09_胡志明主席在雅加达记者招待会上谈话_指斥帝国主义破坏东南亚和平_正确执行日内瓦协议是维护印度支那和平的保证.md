Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 7th: President Ho Chi Minh said at a press conference here this afternoon that his visit has further strengthened the fraternal relations between the Vietnamese and Indonesian peoples, enabling them to have a deeper understanding and further friendship. He said that this visit also helps to strengthen the solidarity between the Asian and African countries that are fighting against colonialism and helps to defend peace in Asia and the world.

He said, "We are deeply moved to see that the Indonesian people gladly sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national reunification." He thanked President Sukarno and the Indonesian people for the warm and unforgettable welcome they gave him.

He said, "Our era is an era in which oppressed nations are rising up to regain independence and freedom. Colonialism is collapsing, and it will soon fall." He said that the Vietnamese people are determined to unite closely with the Indonesian people and the people of Asian and African countries to fight in order to defend their independence and maintain world peace.

He said that the Vietnamese people fully sympathize with the Indonesian government and people's struggle to consolidate independence, defend sovereignty from foreign interference, and liberate West Irian. He said that West Irian is part of Indonesian territory and therefore must be returned to its homeland, Indonesia. He said that the Indonesian people's struggle for national reunification will surely be victorious.

He said that at present, although the forces of peace are constantly growing, the imperialists have not given up their policy of aggression and war plans. He said that together with the Indonesian people and peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese people demand an end to the arms race and a rapid cessation of all atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. He called for an immediate end to the "Cold War" in order to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding between countries to ease world tensions. He said that he warmly supports the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and China to establish peace and collective security zones (nuclear-weapon-free zones) in the Far East and the Pacific region. He demanded the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

He said that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as a step towards the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany is very urgent for the security of Europe and the world.

He pointed out that the activities of imperialists interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries have increased. He said that due to foreign interference, the situation on the Vietnam-Laos border has become abnormal for a time. He said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to maintain and develop good neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos. He believes that the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords on the Laotian question is a guarantee for the interests of the Laotian people and for maintaining peace and security in Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

He said that the Vietnamese people strongly oppose the imperialists' Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, who openly interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and carry out subversive activities in order to establish militaristic regimes, undermine the independence and peace of Southeast Asian countries, and prepare for new wars.

Speaking of the reunification of the two parts of Vietnam, North and South, he said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly suggested to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultation conferences as stipulated in the Geneva Accords to discuss the implementation of general elections to reunify the country. He said that last December, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again sent a note to the South Vietnamese authorities on this issue, but the South Vietnamese authorities did not respond.

He pointed out that imperialist elements are constantly sending weapons and military personnel to South Vietnam, building and expanding airports and strategic roads, and turning South Vietnam into a foreign military base.

He said that in South Vietnam, all patriots, all peace-loving people, and all those who support national reunification continue to be persecuted. Referring to the recent massacre of political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam, he said that the entire Vietnamese people feel great indignation at this extremely barbaric act and demand that the South Vietnamese authorities stop all acts of terror.

He said, "We advocate the peaceful reunification of Vietnam on the basis of independence and democracy, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords." He said, "We are ready to hold talks with the South Vietnamese authorities at any time to discuss all issues related to the reunification of the country in a spirit of understanding and mutual concession for the benefit of the motherland." He said he believes that the Vietnamese people's firm determination to reunify will ultimately prevail.

In answering questions, President Ho Chi Minh said that the Vietnamese people support the suggestion of the Prime Minister of Ceylon on holding an Asian-African economic conference because this suggestion is in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference. He pointed out that Asian-African economic cooperation can be discussed through the Asian-African economic conference suggested by the Prime Minister of Ceylon.

    胡志明主席在雅加达记者招待会上谈话
    指斥帝国主义破坏东南亚和平
    正确执行日内瓦协议是维护印度支那和平的保证
    新华社雅加达7日电　胡志明主席7日下午在这里举行的记者招待会上说，他的这次访问已经进一步加强了越南人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的兄弟般的关系，使他们之间有更深刻的了解和更进一步的友谊。他说，这次访问也有助于加强正在进行反殖民主义斗争的亚非国家之间的团结，有助于保卫亚洲和世界的和平。
    他说，“我们十分感动地看到印度尼西亚人民欣然同情和支持越南人民争取国家重新统一的斗争”。他感谢苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚人民给予他的热情的和令人难忘的欢迎。
    他说，“我们的时代是被压迫民族站起来夺回独立和自由的时代。殖民主义正在崩溃，它不久就要垮台。”他说，越南人民决心和印度尼西亚人民以及亚非各国人民紧密地团结起来进行斗争，以便保卫他们的独立和维护世界和平。
    他说，越南人民完全同情印度尼西亚政府和人民巩固独立、保卫主权不受外国干涉和解放西伊里安的斗争。他说，西伊里安是印度尼西亚领土的一部分，因此必须把它归还它的祖国印度尼西亚。他说，印度尼西亚人民争取国家重新统一的斗争将一定会取得胜利。
    他说，在目前，虽然和平力量正在不断壮大，但是，帝国主义者仍然没有放弃他们的侵略政策和好战计划。他说，和印度尼西亚人民以及世界各地爱好和平人民一起，越南人民要求停止军备竞赛，并且迅速地停止一切原子弹和氢弹试验。他要求立即停止“冷战”，以便建立各国之间相互信任和谅解的气氛来缓和世界紧张局势。他说，他热烈地赞同苏联和中国提出的在远东和太平洋区域建立和平和集体安全地区（无原子武器地区）的建议。他要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位。
    他说，作为用和平和民主的方式统一德国的步骤而缔结对德和约，对欧洲和世界的安全来说是非常迫切的。
    他指出帝国主义干涉东南亚国家的内政的活动有所增加。他说，由于外国的干涉，越南——老挝边境的情况一度变得不正常。他说，越南民主共和国政府愿意和老挝王国保持并发展睦邻关系。他认为，正确地执行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议是老挝人民的利益以及维持印度支那和东南亚各国的和平和安全的保证。
    他说，越南人民强烈反对帝国主义者的东南亚条约组织集团，他们公开干涉东南亚国家的内政和进行颠复活动，以便建立军国主义的政权，破坏东南亚国家的独立和和平，并且准备新的战争。
    他在谈到越南北方和南方两个部分重新统一问题时说，越南民主共和国政府曾经屡次向南越当局建议按日内瓦协议的规定举行协商会议来讨论实行普选以重新统一国家的问题。他说，在去年12月，越南民主共和国政府再次就这个问题向南越当局提出照会，但是，南越当局没有给予答复。
  他指出，帝国主义分子经常把武器和军事人员送到南越去，建立并扩大机场和战略性的道路，把南越变成外国的军事基地。
    他说，在南越，一切爱国人士，一切热爱和平并且赞成国家重新统一的人士都继续不断地遭到迫害。他在谈到南越富利集中营中的政治犯最近遭到屠杀时说，全体越南人民对这种极端野蛮的行动感到极大的愤慨。并且要求南越当局停止一切恐怖行为。
    他说，“我们主张像日内瓦协议所规定的那样在独立和民主的基础上用和平的方法来使越南重新统一。”他说，“我们随时准备和南越当局举行会谈，以便为了祖国的利益本着谅解和互相让步的精神，来讨论有关重新统一国家的一切问题。”他说，他相信，越南人民要求重新统一的坚定的决心最后将会胜利。
    胡志明主席在答复问题时说，越南人民支持锡兰总理关于举行亚非经济会议的建议，因为这个建议符合于万隆会议的精神。他指出，亚非的经济合作可以通过锡兰总理所建议的亚非经济会议来讨论。
