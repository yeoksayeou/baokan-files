    Hemp Production Briefs
    
    Hemp Can Be Planted in Autumn
    The Xingfu (Happiness) Commune in Guanxian County, Sichuan Province, successfully trial-planted autumn hemp in experimental fields. This autumn hemp was sown five days after "Liqiu" (the Start of Autumn) last year and harvested in mid-November. Although the temperature was low during the growth period of the autumn-planted hemp, its development was similar to that of summer hemp, and the yield per unit area even exceeded that of summer hemp. The autumn hemp planted by this commune is the "Qinghua" variety.
    
    Aspiring to Become a Ramie Abundant County
    The people of Suiyang, Guizhou, are actively expanding the area planted with ramie and increasing the yield per unit area of ramie, aspiring to build Suiyang into a county with abundant ramie production. Suiyang originally had 12,700 mu of old ramie fields, and this year it plans to expand to 70,000 mu, striving for an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu. To achieve this plan, this year's ramie production activities in this county started forty days earlier than in previous years.

    Using Machines to Sow Jute
    The Gutang Agricultural Cooperative in Putian County, Fujian Province, successfully trial-produced a jute sowing machine last year that is more than ten times more efficient than manual sowing. This machine can simultaneously dig ditches, sow seeds, and apply fertilizer, and one person with one machine can do the work of two people in the past. This machine can also be used to sow soybeans, broad beans, etc. with slight modifications.

    Ramie Harvested Four Times a Year
    The ramie planted by the Yuanying First Cooperative in Luodu Township, Gongxian County, Sichuan Province, is harvested four times a year, with an average yield of 293 jin per mu. The seasons for harvesting ramie in this cooperative are: ten days before "Xiaoman" (Grain Full) to harvest the first crop, before "Xiaoshu" (Minor Heat) to finish harvesting the second crop, after "Chushu" (the Limit of Heat) to start harvesting the third crop, and before "Shuangjiang" (Frost's Descent) to harvest the fourth crop.

    麻产简讯
    大麻可以秋种
    四川灌县幸福公社在试验地里试种秋大麻成功。这块秋大麻是去年“立秋”后五天播种的，11月中收获。秋种麻生长期间虽然气温较低，但发育和夏麻相仿，单位产量还超过夏麻。这个社播种的秋大麻是“青花种”。
    立志成苎麻丰产县
    贵州绥阳人民积极扩大苎麻种植面积和提高苎麻单位产量，立志把绥阳建成一个丰产苎麻的县份。绥阳原有老麻地一万二千七百亩，今年准备扩大到七万亩，争取平均亩产二千斤。为了实现这个计划，这县今年的苎麻生产活动，比往年提早四十天右左。
    用机器播种黄麻
    福建莆田县谷塘农业社去年试制成功一种比用手播效率高十多倍的黄麻播种机。这种机器使用时同时可挖沟、下种、施肥，一人一机可以做过去两人做的事。这种机器稍加改装还可以播大豆、蚕豆等。
    苎麻一年四收
    四川珙县罗渡乡原武营一社种植的苎麻一年收获四次，平均亩产二百九十三斤。这个社收麻的季节是：“小满”前十天收头麻，“小暑”前收完二麻，“处暑”后开始收三麻，“霜降”前收四麻。
