Financial and Trade Work Should Serve Production
Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In 1958, the socialist construction of Heilongjiang Province, like that of other parts of the country, experienced an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production provided a material foundation for the rapid development of financial and trade work, powerfully promoting the Great Leap Forward in financial and trade work. In turn, financial and trade work promoted the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production from the aspects of distribution and circulation.

From the experience of financial and trade work in that year, we deeply realized that production is the material basis for market supply. Without the development of production, market supply cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, production and the market are interdependent, with the market playing a guiding and promoting role in production. Therefore, we gradually established it as a formula: start from production, do a good job in circulation and distribution, promote the development of production, and meet the growing needs of the people. In implementing this formula, we adopted three methods:

1.  Support and promote industrial and agricultural production through purchasing and sales activities, price policies, and raising funds. This is basic and primary. 2. For marketable livestock, sideline, fishery, and light industrial products, financial and trade departments should actively cooperate with relevant production departments to plan, arrange production, sign contracts, cultivate and establish various types of production bases, and develop commodity economy. 3. Based on the principles of subsidizing inadequacies, providing demonstration guidance, and leading the masses, combine procurement outlets to run some production enterprises directly related to business, contribute technology, experience, improved varieties, and cadres to guide mass production.

In the process of promoting this formula and these three methods, some people believed that this was "meddling in other people's affairs," "not doing one's job properly," and "would affect the business of purchasing, selling, transferring, and storing." Others felt that "cooperating and supporting production is not satisfying," "small-scale work is not as good as large-scale work," and "doing piecemeal work is not as good as doing large-scale work." We criticized these two ideas and practices, explaining that industry, agriculture, and commerce must have a division of labor and a combination. It is not feasible to have only production without distribution and exchange, or to emphasize only the combination aspect without paying attention to the division of labor. If financial and trade departments all engage in production and abandon the means of circulation and distribution, abandoning the basic tasks of serving production and consumption, the result will inevitably be economic stagnation and production paralysis. Similarly, it is not feasible for financial and trade departments to only engage in their own business in isolation, without participating in production, coordinating with, and supporting production, emphasizing only the division of labor aspect without paying attention to the combination aspect. Production and distribution, production-supply-sales are an inseparable whole, and financial and trade work itself is inseparable from production. Financial and trade departments can combine with production and participate in production completely in combination with their own business; participating in production will not only not affect their own business, but only in this way can the level of financial and trade work be improved, the source of goods expanded, the source of funds increased, and financial and trade business developed.

The mass line of financial and trade work, like other work of the Party, must adopt the method of "from the masses, to the masses." However, the mass line in financial and trade work also has characteristics that are not completely the same as other work. This is because financial and trade work not only has a large number of staff and workers, but also directly contacts the broad masses of the people. In this way, the mass line in financial and trade work has two aspects: internal staff and workers and the external broad masses of the people. Only by fully mobilizing and relying on the staff and workers, and mobilizing and relying on the broad masses, can financial and trade work be done well. Last year, Shuangcheng County completed less than 30% of its agricultural and sideline product procurement task in the second quarter after eighty days. Later, a mass movement was launched on a large scale, and a blitz procurement method was adopted, which overfulfilled 70% in just ten days. This experience was very enlightening for us. From its promotion, we summarized the following experience: focus on the center, combine with production, combine regular procurement with blitz procurement, and combine professional teams with mass movements.

In the supply of means of production, we proposed the slogan "Industry and Commerce Cooperation, Arming the Countryside" based on the central government's instructions to produce and supply locally. It developed from "Two Guarantees, Three -izations, Ten Helps" to Five Guarantees (guarantee equipment, guarantee materials, guarantee installation, guarantee teaching, guarantee repair), Five -izations (traction-ization, rail-ization, water conservancy-ization, mechanization, electrification), and Ten Helps, establishing the ability of people's communes to self-repair and self-manufacture. In this way, people's communes can gradually achieve: "small tools can be self-made, large machines can be self-repaired"; the production of production tools can be combined with the technological revolution of the masses; the supply of means of production can be done more, faster, better, and more economically; and a foundation can be laid for gradually realizing the industrialization of the communes, and agricultural mechanization and electrification.

Because the mass line in financial and trade work has the characteristics of combining internal staff and workers with the external broad masses of the people. Therefore, financial and trade work must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party, strengthening the Party's leadership over financial and trade work, combining leadership with the masses, and combining internal masses with external masses. On this issue, there are often two situations: one is that some leading cadres of basic-level Party committees relax their leadership over financial and trade work, and do not ask about or rarely ask about financial and trade work, making financial and trade cadres engage in "their own business" in isolation. The other situation is that some leading cadres of basic-level Party committees, in order to grasp the center and grasp production, transfer financial and trade cadres away from their business positions and use them to engage in production in the same way as cadres in production departments. Doing so seems to add a few people to the central work, but it loses the powerful cooperation and support of the entire organization, which is not conducive to financial and trade work, nor is it conducive to production and central work.

The various departments of the national economy are a whole, and production, supply, and sales are an organically linked whole that cannot be separated. There are departments in a whole; there is a process of production, supply, and sales in a product, which must be separated. Not being able to be separated, and having to be separated, is a unity of opposites. In response to the above two tendencies, we put forward the leadership policy of division of labor on the front and cooperation on the front, and implemented the method of both division of labor and cooperation, which is very effective in solving the two tendencies mentioned above, and also adapts to this dialectical relationship of the unity of opposites.

In the first half of 1958, we helped Shangzhi County summarize their experience in planning, and proposed the policy of relying on the Party, relying on the masses, having a center, having a backbone, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive Great Leap Forward, which solved the contradiction between central work and departmental work. Financial and trade work and production work were twisted into one rope, so that the center was grasped and the overall situation was taken care of, so that financial and trade work not only did not dilute the central work, but also served the central work and promoted the central work. At the same time, financial and trade business was also developed in combination with the center. Songhua River area put forward a slogan "Go down and grab everything, the center leads the rest, each keeps an account, and come back and divide the family." This leadership method of grasping the center, leading the rest, comprehensive arrangement, mutual cooperation, and mutual promotion is very necessary for both financial and trade work and industrial and agricultural production.

In the second half of last year, the whole people engaged in iron and steel on a large scale, requiring financial and trade departments to give strong support. But what attitude should be adopted to support it? One is to squeeze forward and actively support it. The other is a lazybones mentality, saying that "giving way" is support, using the excuse of giving way to stay far away, leaving the "marshal" to fight alone. In response to this situation, we put forward the three words "support, give way, squeeze." "Support" is to actively support the center, focus on the center, combine with production, not only support the center, but also develop the business, which is active support, which is beneficial to production and beneficial to the center. "Give way" is to give way when it should be given. If you take the main road, I will take the side road. It is not that it should not be given way and hinder the "marshal" from walking, nor is it to hide far away and not be close to the side once it is given way; "Squeeze" is that there is always a center, production is fundamental, the Great Leap Forward requires mobilizing the masses to engage in large-scale movements, and financial and trade work cannot fully play its role and cannot support the center well without squeezing up. But the so-called "squeeze" is by no means to advocate squeezing hard to hinder the center, but to be good at using the gaps in industrial and agricultural production movements, drilling in when there are gaps, and squeezing in when there is space, adopting short-term blitzes and engaging in small movements. Doing so will not hinder production or the center, but will do a lot of work, support the center, and promote production. Last year, the amount of central work in our province was much heavier than in previous years, but we used this method, and the purchase volume of agricultural and sideline products not only did not decrease, but increased more than three times compared to the previous year, and various Great Leap Forward indicators were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

Whether it is division of labor on the front and cooperation on the front, or whether it is support, give way, or squeeze, these all prove that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over financial and trade work. Who can both organize division of labor on the front and organize cooperation on the front? Who can grasp the timing and degree of support, give way, and squeeze? Who can so timely grasp the gaps in the production movement and squeeze in and drill in? Only the Party committee can do these things well.

1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard work. The task of financial and trade work is very heavy. We must, under the brilliant light of the general line, further strengthen the Party's leadership, face production, rely on the masses, give play to the role of financial and trade work as a link, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    财贸工作要为生产服务
    中共黑龙江省委书记  杨易辰
    1958年黑龙江省的社会主义建设事业，和全国各地一样，出现了空前大跃进的局面。工农业生产的大跃进，为财贸工作的迅速发展提供了物质基础，有力地推动了财贸工作大跃进，而财贸工作又从分配和流通方面促进了工农业生产的迅速发展。
    从这一年财贸工作的经验中，我们深深体会到生产是市场供应的物质基础，没有生产的发展，就不能保证市场的供应。同时，生产和市场又是相互依存关系，市场对生产起着指导和促进的作用。因此我们逐步把它确定成为一个公式——从生产出发，作好流通和分配的工作。促进生产发展，满足人民日益增长的需要。在贯彻执行这个公式上，我们采取了三个办法：
    一、通过购销活动，价格政策和筹集资金来支援和促进工农业生产，这是基本的，主要的；二、对商品性大的牧副渔业和轻工业产品，财贸部门要主动地配合有关生产部门进行规划，安排生产，签订合同，培养和建立各种类型的生产基地，发展商品经济；三、根据补助不足，示范指导，带动群众的原则，结合采购网点，举办一些与业务有直接关系的生产企业，出技术、出经验、出良种、出干部，以指导群众生产。
    在推行这一个公式和三个方法的过程中，曾有人认为这样作是“多管闲事”，是“不务正业”，“会影响购、销、调、存的业务”。也有人觉得，“配合、支持生产不过瘾”，“小干不如大干”，“搞零星的不如搞大宗的”。我们批判了这两种想法和作法，说明工、农、商，要有分工，有结合，光有生产没有分配和交换，光强调结合的一面，不注意分工的一面是不行的，财贸部门都去搞生产，而放弃流通和分配的手段，放弃为生产和消费服务的基本任务，其结果必然使经济停滞，使生产陷于瘫痪。同样的，财贸部门只孤立地去搞本身业务，而不参与生产，配合与支援生产，光强调分工的一面，而不注意结合的一面也是不行的。生产和分配，产供销是不可分割的总体，财贸工作本身就是和生产密不可分的，财贸部门结合生产，参与生产，完全可以结合本身业务进行；参与生产，不仅不会影响本身的业务，而且只有这样才能提高财贸工作的水平，扩大货源，增加财源，发展财贸业务。
  财贸工作的群众路线，同党的其它工作一样，必须采取“从群众中来到群众中去”的方法，但是，财贸工作中的群众路线，也有与其它工作不完全相同的特点，这就是因为财贸工作不仅有为数众多的职工群众，而且绝大部分还直接接触广大人民群众。这样，财贸工作中的群众路线就具有内部职工群众和外部广大人民群众的两个方面，不仅要充分发动与依靠职工群众，还要发动与依靠广大群众，才能把财贸工作办好。双城县去年第二季度的农副产品采购任务，经过八十天才完成不到30％。后来大搞群众运动，采取突击收购的办法，只十天就超额完成了70％。这一经验对我们启发很大，从推广中我们概括了这样一条经验，即：围绕中心，结合生产，经常收购和突击收购相结合，专业队伍和群众运动相结合。
    在生产资料的供应上我们根据中央指出就地生产，就地供应的方针，提出了“工商协作，武装农村”的口号，并从“二包、三化、十帮助”发展为五包（包设备、包资材、包安装、包教、包修）、五化（牵引化、轨道化、水利化、机械化、电气化）十帮助，建立起人民公社自修自造的能力。这样就可以逐步使人民公社做到：“小的工具能自造，大的机器能自修”；就可以使生产工具的生产和群众的技术革命结合起来；就可以多快好省地做好生产资料的供应，就可以为逐步实现公社工业化，农业机械化、电气化打下基础。
    由于财贸工作中的群众路线具有内部职工群众与外部广大人民群众相结合的特点。因此，财贸工作就必须放在党的绝对领导之下，加强党对财贸工作的领导，使领导与群众相结合，使内部群众与外部群众相结合。在这个问题上，常常有这样两种情况：一种情况是有的基层党委领导干部放松对财贸工作的领导，不问或很少过问财贸工作，使财贸干部孤立的搞“自己的业务”，另一种情况是有的基层党委领导干部为了抓中心，抓生产，把财贸干部调离业务岗位，同生产部门的干部一样使用去搞生产。这样做，好像是对中心工作增加了几个人，但却失去整个组织的有力配合与支援，既不利于财贸工作，也不利于生产和中心工作。
    国民经济各部门是一个总体，产、供、销是一个有机联系的整体，是不可分割的。在一个总体中有各部门；在一个产品上有产、供、销的过程，这又是必须分别的。又不能分，又要有分，这是对立的统一。针对上述的两种倾向，我们提出了战线分工，战线协作的领导方针，实行既分工，又协作的办法，对解决上面说的两种倾向很有效，对这个对立统一的辩证关系也适应。
    1958年上半年，我们帮助尚志县总结他们进行规划的经验，提出依靠党，依靠群众，有中心，有骨干，全面规划，全面跃进的方针，解决了中心工作和部门工作的矛盾。把财贸工作、生产工作拧成一股绳，这样既抓了中心，又照顾了全面，使财贸工作不仅不冲淡中心工作，而且还为中心工作服务，促进了中心工作。同时也结合中心发展了财贸业务。松花江地区，提出了一个口号“下去一把抓，中心带其它，各记一本账，回来再分家”。这种既抓中心，又带其它，全面安排，互相配合，互相促进的领导方法，不论对财贸工作，对工农业生产都是十分必要的。
    去年下半年全民大搞钢铁，要求财贸部门大力给以支援。但究竟采取什么态度去支援呢？一种是挤上前去，积极的支援。另一种是懒汉思想，说“让路”就是支援，借口让路，离得远远的，使“元帅”孤军作战。针对这种情况，我们提出了“援、让、挤”三个字。“援”，是积极地支援中心，围绕中心，结合生产，不仅支援了中心，同时也把业务开展了，这才是积极的支援，才对生产有利，对中心有利。“让”，是应让的必让。你走大路，我走小路，不是应让的不让，妨害“元帅”走路，也不是一让就躲得远远的不靠边；“挤”，中心是经常有的，生产是根本，大跃进就要发动群众大搞运动，不挤上去财贸工作就不能充分发挥作用，就不能很好的支援中心。但所谓“挤”绝不是提倡妨碍中心的硬挤，而是善于利用工农业生产运动的空隙，有缝就钻，见空就挤，采取短促突击，搞小运动。这样做，既不会妨碍生产、妨碍中心，还作了很多工作，支援了中心，促进了生产。去年我省中心工作分量比历年都重得多，但我们运用了这种方法，农副产品收购量不仅没有减少，反而比上年提高了三倍多，各项跃进指标都提前、超额完成了任务。
    无论战线分工，战线协作也罢，无论援、让、挤也罢，这些都证明了必须加强党对财贸工作的领导才行。谁能够既组织战线分工，又组织战线协作呢？谁能够掌握好援、让、挤的时机和分寸呢？谁能够那么适时的抓住生产运动的空隙，挤上来钻进去呢？只有党委才能够做到并做好这些工作。
    1959年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，财贸工作的任务是很繁重的，我们必须在总路线光辉照耀下，进一步加强党的领导，面向生产，依靠群众，发挥财贸工作的纽带作用，为实现更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
