Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 17th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a speech to the People's House on March 17th regarding the situation in the Middle East, considered the "conflict and mutual accusations" between the Republic of Iraq and the UAR to be "most unfortunate and regrettable." He said that he was "disturbed by some developments among friends in the Middle East."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio received the Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to Indonesia, Amrousi, on March 14th. According to the Indonesian News Agency, Subandrio said after the meeting that Indonesia was not very pleased with the current differences between Iraq and the UAR, because such differences could lead to major conflicts between them. In this regard, he said that Asian countries still face many domestic and international problems, and any tensions between Asian countries will only undermine their strength to cope with these many problems.

A few days prior to this, Subandrio had summoned the Iraqi Chargé d'Affaires to Indonesia, Fadli.

According to Antara News Agency on March 15th, the Chairman of the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, Anwar Tjokroaminoto, and the Chairman of the Indonesian Muslim League, Dahlan, jointly sent telegrams to the governments of the UAR and Iraq.

The telegram said: "For the sake of the UAR and Iraq, and for the unity of the people of Asian and African countries, the Indonesian people demand that the disputes between the UAR and Iraq be resolved by peaceful means in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference."
