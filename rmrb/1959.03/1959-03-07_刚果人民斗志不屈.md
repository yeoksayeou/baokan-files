    The news from Leopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, today reports that Africans in Thysville, ninety miles south of Leopoldville, are resisting paying taxes to the colonial authorities, opposing the colonial authorities' census, and have clashed with colonial police. The Belgian colonial authorities have hurriedly dispatched troops from other places to suppress them.

    It is reported that the strikes held by Africans in many parts of the Congo are continuing. In the Ruanda-Urundi region, which is under Belgian "trusteeship," African strikes have also broken out.

    It is reported that on February 28, after a football match held at the Luluabourg Stadium in central Congo, clashes also occurred between Congolese and armed colonial police. According to a report from Brussels: In order to suppress the Congolese people's growing struggle against colonial rule, the Belgian colonial authorities have decided to send an additional battalion of troops to Kitona, on the Congo River near Banana.

    It is reported that this army will be airlifted there, and the Belgian colonial authorities have expanded their military base in Kitona to accommodate this army. Sources say that the Belgian Ministry of Defense has also decided to send patrol planes and helicopters to the Congo.

    刚果人民斗志不屈
    新华社5日讯　今天来自比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔的消息报道，利奥波德维尔以南九十英里的太斯维尔的非洲人抗拒向殖民当局纳税，反对殖民当局进行户口调查，并且同殖民警察发生冲突。比利时殖民当局已经赶忙从其他地方派遣军队前去镇压。
    据报道，刚果许多地方非洲人举行的罢工还在继续中。在比利时的“托管地”卢安达——乌隆迪区，也爆发了非洲人的罢工。
    据报道，2月28日，在刚果中部的路路阿堡运动场举行了一场足球比赛之后，也发生了刚果人同武装的殖民警察之间的冲突事件。另据布鲁塞尔消息：比利时殖民当局为了镇压刚果人民日益发展的反对殖民统治的斗争，已经决定增派一营军队到刚果河畔靠近巴纳内的凯塔内去。
    据报道，这支军队将被空运到那里去，比利时殖民当局已经把它在凯塔内的军事基地加以扩充，以便容纳这支军队。有消息说，比利时国防部还决定派遣巡逻飞机和直升飞机到刚果去。
