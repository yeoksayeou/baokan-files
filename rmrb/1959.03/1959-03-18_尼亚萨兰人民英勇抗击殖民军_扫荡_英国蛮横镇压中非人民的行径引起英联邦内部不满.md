Xinhua News Agency, Hillborough, Nyasaland: The large-scale bloody suppression currently being carried out by the British colonial authorities in the Northern Province of Nyasaland is being met with resolute resistance from Africans.

	In the mountainous areas around Hillborough in the Northern Province, Africans wielding spears and other weapons are valiantly resisting the "mopping-up" operations conducted by over 500 colonial troops equipped with modern weapons and supported by the air force. In the Hillborough area, Africans are constantly sabotaging bridges and other infrastructure. Sometimes, entire villages of Africans use stones and spears to attack colonial army patrols armed with rifles, mortars, and machine guns. This small area of Hillborough has become a combat center for the people of Nyasaland in their resistance against British colonial rule.

	On March 15th, a senior British military officer in charge of commanding this "mopping-up" operation admitted that the resistance of Africans in this area was "increasing daily."

	In the Mlanje area of the Southern Province, the situation remains tense. On March 15th, the colonial authorities arrested many more Africans. In the capital, Zomba, colonial troops attacked two African villages and arrested twenty-three Africans.

	In the Kasuya and Chisebo areas in central Nyasaland, colonial police continue to search for a leader of the African National Congress. On March 14th, new African demonstrations erupted in the same area due to the killing of two Africans.

	Reports indicate that African railway workers in Nyasaland have also gone on strike to resist British colonial rule.

	In Southern Rhodesia, the colonial authorities announced on March 15th that they were banning any mass gatherings in African residential towns in order to further suppress the African anti-colonial struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th, Blantyre, Nyasaland: In the Misuku Mountains in the far north of Nyasaland, Africans are engaged in fierce battles with colonial military police who have come to "mop up."

	According to reports, these mountains are full of caves. Large numbers of Africans stay outside the villages during the day, using these caves as bases to attack the police forces of the colonial authorities with spears, stones, and axes. Their heroic actions have received widespread support from the masses.

	In the Southern Province of Nyasaland, the situation in the Mlanje area remains tense. Reports indicate that Africans are still active in the tea plantations there. However, the colonial authorities have not released any information about large-scale military suppression activities in this area.

	According to an announcement by the colonial authorities, seventy-nine Africans were arrested throughout Nyasaland on March 15th. Among them, forty-nine were arrested in Kasungu in the Central Province.

	The British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, who has been conducting a series of activities in Nyasaland, left Blantyre on March 17th to conduct activities in Northern Rhodesia.

	In Lusaka, the capital of Northern Rhodesia, the colonial authorities issued a notice stating that police had arrested seven more Africans.

	Reports indicate that when Lusaka District Colonial Governor Mitchell-Hedges was trying a case in the Lusaka court on March 16th, he admitted that the brutality of the colonial police "seems" to be the root cause of the African resistance that unfolded in Chihaji, a suburb of Lusaka, in February.

	He also admitted that the arrested Africans were being mistreated. He said that it had been proven that the police were abusing prisoners in jails, and that some people had even lied in their testimonies.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th, London: An article by journalist Colin Legum published in "The Observer" on March 15th indicated that the policies adopted by Britain in Central Africa have been condemned throughout the Commonwealth.

	According to the journalist's report, in Accra, the British High Commissioner to Ghana received a protest letter from a group of demonstrators gathered outside his office.

	In Australia, "the establishment of the Central African Federation is considered a mistake."

	In Malaya, "people condemned the mass arrests of leaders of the Nyasaland National Congress."

	In Singapore, politicians "today almost unanimously attack the measures taken by (Central African Federation Prime Minister) Sir Roy Welensky and demand that London send a fact-finding mission to the area."

	In Nigeria, "people generally use strong language to criticize the British government's handling of the situation in Nyasaland."

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th, London: Some British politicians oppose the British government's policy of armed suppression of the people of Nyasaland.

	Conservative MP Boothby said in a television program on March 15th that young British men would not approve of being sent to Central Africa to (engage in suppression). He said: "The people of our country do not want to see any more bloodshed in any colony."

	Former Labour MP Foot said, "Only a few hundred thousand white people are trying to impose their will unchanged on millions of Africans. Africans in the second half of the twentieth century will not agree to this." He demanded that the government abandon its current "terrible policy."

    尼亚萨兰人民英勇抗击殖民军“扫荡”
    英国蛮横镇压中非人民的行径引起英联邦内部不满
    据新华社讯　尼亚萨兰的希尔堡消息：英国殖民当局目前在尼亚萨兰北方省进行的大规模血腥镇压正遭到非洲人的坚决反抗。
    在北方省希尔堡周围的山区，非洲人拿着长矛等武器英勇地抗击着五百多名配备有现代武器的殖民军在空军配合下所进行的“扫荡”。非洲人在希尔堡地区不断破坏桥梁等，有时，整个村庄的非洲人用石头和长矛来袭击拥有步枪、迫击炮和机枪的殖民军巡逻队。这个面积不大的希尔堡地区已成为尼亚萨兰人民反抗英国殖民统治的战斗中心。
    一名负责指挥这次“扫荡”的英国高级军官在15日承认这个地区的非洲人的抵抗“正在日益加强”。
    在南方省的姆兰杰地区，局势仍然紧张。在15日，殖民当局又逮捕了许多非洲人。在首府松巴地区，殖民军队袭击了两个非洲人村庄，逮捕了二十三个非洲人。
    在尼亚萨兰中部的卡西亚、契塞波等地区，殖民警察继续在搜捕一个非洲人国民大会的领袖。14日，在同一地区因有两个非洲人被杀又爆发了新的非洲人的示威游行。
    有消息说，尼亚萨兰非洲人铁路工人为了反抗英国殖民统治也举行了罢工。
    在南罗得西亚，殖民当局为了进一步镇压非洲人的反殖民斗争在15日宣布，禁止在非洲人聚居的城镇举行任何群众集会。
    新华社17日讯　尼亚萨兰布兰太尔消息：在尼亚萨兰极北端希尔堡地区的米苏库群山中间，非洲人正在同赶来“扫荡”的殖民军警展开剧烈战斗。
    据报道，这些山上到处都是山洞。人数众多的非洲人白天呆在村外，以这些山洞作为基地，用长矛、石块和斧头袭击殖民当局的警察部队。他们的英勇行动得到了群众的广泛支持。
    在尼亚萨兰的南方省，姆兰杰地区的局势仍然紧张。有消息说，非洲人仍不断在那里的茶叶种植园中进行活动。但是殖民当局没有透露有关在这一带进行大规模军事镇压活动的消息。
    据殖民当局宣布，15日又在尼亚萨兰全境逮捕了七十九个非洲人。其中在中央省的卡宋古就逮捕了四十九人。
    在尼亚萨兰进行了一连串活动的英国协办殖民地事务国务大臣佩思已在17日离开布兰太尔去北罗得西亚进行活动。
    在北罗得西亚首府卢萨喀，殖民当局发表公告说，警察又逮捕了七个非洲人。
    有消息说，卢萨喀地区殖民长官密契尔—赫格斯16日在卢萨喀法院裁判一个案件时承认，殖民警察的暴行“似乎”是2月间非洲人在卢萨喀郊外的契哈杰展开反抗活动的根本原因。
    他还承认被逮捕的非洲人正在遭受虐待。他说，已经证明，警察在监牢里虐待犯人，有些人还在证词中说谎。
    新华社17日讯　伦敦消息：“观察家报”在15日发表的记者科林·勒格姆的一篇报道表明，英国在中非所采取的政策在英联邦内部到处遭到谴责。
    据这个记者报道，在阿克拉，英国驻加纳高级专员收到了聚集在他的办公室外面的一群示威者交给他的一份抗议书。
    在澳大利亚，“建立中非联邦被认为是一个错误”。
    在马来亚，“人们谴责大规模地逮捕尼亚萨兰国民大会的领袖们”。
    在新加坡，政界人士“今天几乎一致攻击（中非联邦总理）韦伦斯基爵士所采取的措施并且要求伦敦派遣一个调查团到当地去”。
    在尼日利亚，“人们普遍地使用激烈的言词批评英国政府对于尼亚萨兰局势的处理”。
    新华社17日讯　伦敦消息：一些英国政界人士反对英国政府对尼亚萨兰人民进行武装镇压的政策。
    保守党议员布斯比15日在一次电视节目中说，英国小伙子是不会赞成被派往中非去（从事镇压）的。他说：“我们国家的人民不愿意再见到任何殖民地上的大流血。”
    前工党议员富特说，“只有几十万人的少数白种人企图把他们的意志一成不变地强加在千百万非洲人身上，二十世纪后半叶的非洲人是不会同意的”。他要求政府抛弃目前所施行的“可怕的政策”。
