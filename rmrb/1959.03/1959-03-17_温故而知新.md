    Reviewing the Old to Know the New
    Achieved Through Thinking
    Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, in his book "Lunheng" in the "Xie Duan Pian" chapter, wrote the following sentences: "Knowing the ancient but not the present is called land sinking," "Knowing the present but not the ancient is called blindness," "Reviewing the old to know the new can be a teacher," "Knowing neither the ancient nor the present, how can one be called a teacher." These views, even today, are not outdated.
    When we were young, we often heard some old scholars say, "Half of the Analects can govern the world." This saying, of course, seems laughable now. Because history has long proven that not to mention "half" of the Analects, even the "entire" Analects could not govern the world of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, let alone govern today's world. To govern today's world, we still need Marxism-Leninism, just as Comrade Mao Zedong said: The Chinese people have found Marxism-Leninism, this universal truth applicable everywhere, and only then has the face of China changed. The old scholars are actually "knowing the ancient but not the present" figures, naturally unable to understand this truth.
    The number of people who believe that "half of the Analects can govern the world" is small, but there are still people who "know the ancient but not the present." Thirty years ago, Hu Shih, after stirring up a gust of vernacular literature, busied himself with "reorganizing the national heritage." He had ulterior motives, taking advantage of the confusion of those who "know the ancient but not the present," saying that "being led by the nose by Confucius and Zhu Xi is certainly not brilliant, and being led by the nose by Marx and Lenin is not heroic." Some people were unfortunately led by his flowery words into the piles of old papers; some people were influenced by the research methods of various bourgeois scholars and went into the piles of old papers. They were muddle-headed for a long time.
    The changes in the past ten years have been enormous. The spring thunder of the Great Leap Forward awakened the sleeping state of the above-mentioned people; they stepped out of the "ivory tower," and upon seeing the world, they had the feeling of "seven days in the cave, a thousand years in the world." So, some people quickly caught up, going to the countryside and factories, going among the workers and peasants, facing reality, and conducting large-scale investigations and research; people who were more familiar with historical materials also planned how to make the ancient serve the present. In this way, current practical problems are valued, the situation of always referring to the Three Dynasties is rarely seen, and the work of philosophy, social sciences, and teaching research has greatly changed the atmosphere, which is encouraging. This is a good start.
    Does the idea of "valuing the ancient and belittling the present" still exist today? Of course, there is still some, but much less. Lenin said: "One of the greatest misfortunes left to us by the old capitalist society is the complete separation of book knowledge from practice." If this misfortune is not eradicated one day, the idea of "valuing the ancient and belittling the present" will always exist. Therefore, the slogan "valuing the present and belittling the ancient" is not outdated.
    Here is a new question: Advocating "valuing the present and belittling the ancient," how exactly do we understand the relationship between the ancient and the present? People have come out of the piles of old papers, will they still have to be related to "old papers" in the future? Some young people have not delved into the piles of old papers, will they have to delve into them in the future?
    In my opinion, the so-called "belittling the ancient" is not "anti-ancient," nor is it to make people forget the ancient. Belittling and valuing are relative terms. Valuing the present and belittling the ancient is nothing more than asking people to learn from the ancient for the present, and to make the ancient serve the present. What is wrong with "old papers"? There is no need to be estranged from it. We must delve into it today, we must delve into it tomorrow, and someone will still have to delve into it in ten thousand years. The question is what kind of position, viewpoint, and method to use to delve into it. This is a question of how to treat the cultural heritage of mankind, and it is also related to how to build a proletarian modern culture.
    We shoulder the historical task of cultural revolution. To realize this task, we cannot do without a certain economic foundation, and at the same time, we must absorb a large amount of foreign culture, inherit and develop our own ancient culture. Knowledge is inheritable. The knowledge accumulated by the predecessors is left to the next generation, and the descendants continue to create and accumulate new knowledge on the basis of the knowledge left by the predecessors. They develop on the basis of inheritance, and each generation surpasses the previous generation. Human science and culture are constantly progressing according to this law. Lenin taught us: "Proletarian culture does not fall from the sky," it is the "inevitable result of the development of the sum total of human knowledge." "Only by accurately understanding the culture created by the entire development process of mankind, and only by transforming this past culture, can we build a proletarian culture." Marx inherited German classical philosophy and created dialectical materialism and historical materialism, inherited British classical political economy and created the theory of surplus value, and inherited French utopian socialism and created scientific socialism. Marx inherited these excellent achievements of the nineteenth century, but he did not limit himself to it; he continued to advance and carried out a scientific revolution, thereby opening up an era for the development of science. Marx did not despise those "old papers." "He examined everything that human society had created with a critical attitude, and did not ignore anything. He re-examined and criticized everything that human thought had established, and tested it one by one according to the practice of the workers' movement, and then made those conclusions that could not be obtained by those who were limited by the narrowness of the bourgeoisie or bound by bourgeois prejudices." (Lenin) This is the shining example that Marx set for us in his attitude towards the scientific and cultural heritage of mankind.
    We should spare no effort to learn from Marx. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "China's long feudal society created a brilliant ancient culture." In the history of our country, "there have been many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, military strategists, writers, and artists, and rich cultural classics." Taking philosophy as an example, as early as the Zhou Dynasty, the prelude to ancient Chinese materialist thought had been unveiled; Duke Zhou's saying that "Heaven is not credible," and the sentence in the Book of Songs "The mandate of Heaven is impermanent," all reflected that the Zhou people in some respects had doubts about Heaven, although the Zhou people basically still recognized the existence of "Heaven" and still believed that "Heaven" was the final master. By the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, schools of thought were numerous, and a hundred schools of thought contended. From Lao Tzu, Confucius, Mozi, and Yang Zhu, to Zhuang Zhou, Mencius, Xun Qing, and Han Fei, each formed their own school of thought. After that, there were Dong Zhongshu and Wang Chong in the Han Dynasty, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, and Xuanzang in the Tang Dynasty, Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai, Zhu Xi, and Lu Jiuyuan in the Song Dynasty, and Wang Shouren, Wang Fuzhi, Wang Gen, and Li Zhi in the Ming Dynasty, and Yan Xizhai and Dai Dongyuan in the Qing Dynasty. Among these people, there were idealists and materialists; their theories represented the interests of the ruling class at that time, and some also reflected the demands of the working people at that time; among the documents they left behind, there are certainly many "feudal dross," but there are also "democratic essences," and they are not without the essence of their times. However, these heritages have not yet been fully sorted out using Marxist-Leninist methods. Philosophy is like this, and so are social sciences and natural sciences. And many of these heritages are preserved in the so-called "old papers." If they are not sorted out, they will always sleep there, and we will only be in a state of "knowing the present but not the ancient," and it will of course be very difficult to make the ancient serve the present. Therefore, believing in the ancients, indulging in piles of old papers, and escaping from reality will ultimately result in "knowing the ancient but not the present," and will never have much promise; but forgetting ancestors, severing history, and adopting a nihilistic attitude towards the scientific and cultural heritage of mankind cannot be considered a Marxist. The mistake of those who have delved into the piles of old papers is not that they have delved into the "old papers," but that they have treated the "old papers" with wrong purposes and incorrect positions, viewpoints, and methods; young people who have not delved into the piles of old papers, "if they think that it is enough to know the conclusions of communist science, without needing to understand the entire body of knowledge from which the communist doctrine itself arose," that is wrong (Lenin).
    The correct approach should be "reviewing the old to know the new." The saying "reviewing the old to know the new" accurately reflects the dialectical relationship between the inheritance and development of scientific culture. One of the principles of bourgeois scholars' research is to conduct academic research for the sake of academic research, and to conduct scientific research for the sake of scientific research; in dealing with historical heritage, they conduct research for the sake of research, learn from the ancient for the sake of learning from the ancient, and review the old for the sake of reviewing the old. Our principle is different from this. Our purpose of "reviewing the old" is to "know the new," the purpose of learning from the ancient is for the present, "everything that we can use today should be absorbed," "clearing up the development process of ancient culture, eliminating its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence" (Mao Zedong). The word "delve" itself is not a bad word, it depends on how you delve into it. Delving in naturally does not mean hiding in, and consciously delving in is different from being led by the nose and dragged in. The purpose of delving in is to learn from the ancient for the present, and to make the ancient serve the present; delving in with a purpose is for the purpose of delving out again; going in has a purpose, and coming out is not empty-handed. In this way, we can absorb inexhaustible wealth from the rich scientific and cultural heritage of the ancient, examine it, test it, critically accept it, and use it to build the edifice of proletarian culture.
    Some young comrades, after achieving a little success, easily see everything as very simple. They seem to think that philosophy and social sciences are much simpler than natural sciences, and that they can climb to the glorious peak without going through any difficulties and obstacles, which is a great misunderstanding. Philosophy and social sciences, merely their historical documents alone are as vast as the ocean, and it is by no means possible for one person to finish reading them all in their lifetime, let alone examine them, explore them, criticize them, and test them one by one as Marx did. Regarding scientific knowledge, our current situation is still one of low and few; low means that our scientific level is still very low; few means that we still do not know much about the ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. We have a rich heritage left by our predecessors, we have the desire to humbly learn from foreign cultures, we have Marxism-Leninism as ideological guidance, we have the correct attitude of revolutionary teachers towards historical heritage as an example, we have the style of breaking superstitions and emancipating our minds that has been formed in the Great Leap Forward, plus a down-to-earth attitude, diligent study and hard thinking, and diligently delving in for one year, two years, three years, five years, eight years, or ten years, we will surely achieve success. We must make the brilliant scientific and cultural heritage shine brightly in our generation, and create a more brilliant proletarian modern science and culture that surpasses our predecessors.

### 温故而知新

    温故而知新
    成于思
    东汉王充在其所著“论衡”一书的“谢短篇”中有如下几句话：“知古不知今，谓之陆沉”，“知今不知古，谓之盲瞽”，“温故知新，可以为师”，“古今不知，称师如何”。在以前，孔丘也说过：“温故而知新，可以为师矣”。这些见解，今天看来，仍不过时。
    我们小的时候，常听到一些老学究说：“半部论语可以治天下”。这种说法，现在看来当然可笑。因为历史早已证明：不要说是“半部”论语，就是“全部”论语，连春秋战国时代的天下也都没有治得了，更谈不到治今天的天下了。治今天的天下，还得靠马克思列宁主义，正如毛泽东同志所说：中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目才起了变化。老学究们实际上是些“知古不知今”的人物，自然无法懂得这个道理。
    相信“半部论语可以治天下”的人是为数不多了，可是“知古不知今”的人却还是有。三十年前的胡适，闹了一阵白话文之后，就忙着“整理国故”去了。他别有用心，利用了那些“知古不知今”的人的糊涂，说什么“被孔丘、朱熹牵着鼻子走固然不算高明，被马克思列宁牵着鼻子走也不算好汉”。有些人就不幸被他一阵花言巧语，牵着鼻子走进故纸堆中去了；有些人则是受了各种资产阶级学者治学方法的影响，走进故纸堆中去了。他们昏昏沉沉，过了好一阵子。
    近十年来的变化大极了。大跃进的春雷惊醒了上述那些人的沉睡状态；他们走出“象牙之塔”，一见世面，大有“洞中方七日，世上已千年”之感。于是有的人便急起直追，下乡下厂，走到工农中去，面向实际，大搞调查研究；比较熟悉历史资料的人，也计划着如何使古为今用了。这样，当前的现实问题被人重视了，言必称三代的情况少见了，哲学、社会科学、教学研究工作从此大大改变了风气，令人为之振奋。这是一个良好的开端。
    今天“厚古薄今”的思想是否还有呢？当然还有，不过是少得多了。列宁说：“旧时资本主义社会所遗留给我们的最大祸害之一，就是书本知识与实践完全隔离”。这个祸害一天不根除，“厚古薄今”的思想总会存在，因此，“厚今薄古”的口号还没有过时。
    这里又有一个新的问题：提倡“厚今薄古”，究竟如何认识古和今的关系？人们从故纸堆中走出来了，今后还要不要再和“故纸”发生关系？有些青年人，没有钻过故纸堆，今后还要不要去钻？
    在我看来，所谓“薄古”并不是“非古”，也不是要人忘古。薄与厚，是相对而言的。厚今薄古，无非是要人学古为今，使古为今用。“故纸”何尝是什么坏东西？用不着和它疏远，今天要钻，明天要钻，一万年也还是要有人钻它，问题在于是用什么样的立场、观点、方法钻它。这是一个如何对待人类文化遗产的问题，也是关系到如何建设无产阶级现代文化的问题。
    我们肩负着文化革命的历史任务。实现这个任务，固然离不开一定的经济基础，同时又要大量吸收外来文化，继承并发展我们自己的古代文化。知识是有继承性的，前人积累起来的知识留给后一代，后人就在前人留下的知识的基础上，继续创造和积累新知识，在继承的基础上发展，一代胜过一代，人类科学文化就是按照这样的规律，不断进步。列宁教导说：“无产阶级文化，并不是从天上掉下来的”，它是人类“知识总汇发展的必然结果”。“只有确切通晓人类全部发展过程所创造的文化，只有改造这种已往的文化，才能建设无产阶级文化”。马克思继承了德国古典哲学而创造了辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义，继承了英国古典政治经济学而创造了剩余价值学说，继承了法国空想社会主义而创造了科学的社会主义。马克思继承了十九世纪这些优秀成果，但又不以它为限；他继续前进，实行了科学上的革命，从而为科学的发展开辟了一个时代。马克思并没有轻视那些“故纸”。“凡人类社会所创造出的一切，他都用批判态度来审查过，任何事物也没有忽略过去。凡人类思想所建树出的一切，他都重新探讨过，批判过，并根据工人运动的实践来一一检验过，于是就作出了那些为资产阶级狭隘性限制或被资产阶级偏见束缚住的人所不能得出的结论。”（列宁）这便是马克思在对待人类科学文化遗产的态度方面给我们树立的光辉榜样。
    我们应当不遗余力地学习马克思。毛泽东同志说：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化”。在我国历史上，“有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、发明家、政治家、军事家、文学家和艺术家，有丰富的文化典籍”。拿哲学来说，早在周代，就已揭开了中国古代唯物主义思想的序幕；周公的“天不可信”之说，诗经上有“天命靡常”的句子，都反映了周人在某些方面已有对天存疑的思想，尽管周人在基本上还是承认“天”的存在，还是认为“天”是最后的主宰。到了春秋战国时代，学派林立，百家争鸣，从老?、孔丘、墨翟、杨朱，到庄周、孟轲、荀卿、韩非，都各成一家之言。此后，汉有董仲舒、王充，唐有韩、柳、玄奘，宋有周敦颐、二程、张载、朱熹、陆九渊，明有王守仁、王夫之、王艮、李贽，清有颜习斋、戴东原。上述这些人，有唯心论者，也有唯物论者；他们的学说，有的是代表着当时统治阶级的利益，有的也反映了当时劳动人民的要求；他们遗留下来的文献，其中固然有许多“封建性的糟粕”，然而也有“民主性的精华”，而不失为他们时代的精华。可是这些遗产，都还未充分地用马克思列宁主义的方法加以整理。哲学如此，社会科学、自然科学也莫不如此。而这些遗产，许多就是保藏在所谓“故纸”之中，不加整理，它就永远在那里睡大觉，我们也就只好陷于“知今不知古”的状态之中，要古为今用，当然就很困难。所以说：迷信古人，沉醉于故纸堆中，逃避现实，到头来是“知古不知今”，固然是永远不会有多大出息；但是忘掉祖宗，割断历史，对人类科学文化遗产采取一种虚无主义的态度，也不能算是马克思主义者。钻过故纸堆的人，其错不在于钻了“故纸”，而在于他们本着错误的目的，运用了不正确的立场、观点、方法去对待“故纸”；没有钻过故纸堆的青年人，“如果以为无须领会共产主义学说本身所由产生的全部知识，而只要通晓共产主义口号，只要通晓共产主义科学的结论就已经足够了”，那是错误的（列宁）。
    正确的做法，应当是“温故而知新”。“温故而知新”一语，确切地反映了科学文化的继承和发展的辩证关系。资产阶级学者治学的原则之一是为学术而学术，为科学而科学；在对待历史遗产方面，是为考证而考证，为学古而学古，为温故而温故。我们的原则异于是。我们“温故”的目的是“知新”，学古的目的是为今，“凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收”，“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件”（毛泽东）。“钻”字本身并不是个坏字眼，就看你是怎么个钻法。钻进去自然不是躲进去，自觉地钻进去也不同于被人牵着鼻子拉进去。钻进去的目的是学古为今，古为今用；有目的地钻了进去，是为了再钻出来；进去有目的，出来无空手。这样，我们就可以从古代丰富的科学文化遗产中吸取用之不竭的财富，审查它、检验它，批判地接受它，用它来建设无产阶级文化的大厦。
    有些青年同志，取得了一点成就，就轻易地把一切都看得很简单。他们似乎认为，哲学、社会科学比自然科学要简单得多，不必经过什么艰难险阻也可以攀登上光辉的高峰，这是极大的误解。哲学、社会科学，仅仅是它的历史文献也是浩如烟海的，决非一个人穷其一生所能全部读完，更不要说像马克思所做的那样去审查它、探讨它、批判它、一一检验它了。对于科学知识，我们的现状还是一低二少；低，是说我们的科学水平还很不高；少，是说我们对于古今中外还知之不多。我们有前人留下的丰富遗产，有虚心学习外来文化的愿望，有马列主义作为思想指导，有革命导师们对待历史遗产的正确态度作榜样，有了大跃进中已经形成的破除迷信、解放思想的风格，再加上踏踏实实的态度，勤学苦思，好好钻进去，一年两年、三年五年、八年十年，必将有成。我们要在我们这一代使灿烂的科学文化遗产大放异彩，并创造出胜过前人的更灿烂的无产阶级的现代科学和文化。
