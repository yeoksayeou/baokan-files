Important Ways to Improve Casting Capacity
    Liu Huan

    Casting is the first process in mechanical production. In terms of weight, castings usually account for about 60% to 80% of general mechanical products. Rapidly increasing casting production capacity is an important link in ensuring a greater leap forward in the machinery industry this year.

    A good way to improve casting capacity is to promote mud molding, a precious legacy of traditional Chinese science and technology, based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods.

    The combination of mud molding technology and the sand molding method in modern casting technology, drawing on the strengths of the new method and supplementing the shortcomings of the ancient method, has brought China's molding technology into a new stage. At present, mud molds can not only be used to make simple castings, but also to make castings with quite complex shapes; not only can they be used to make medium and small castings, but also heavy parts weighing more than ten tons; not only can they cast thick-walled castings, but also thin-walled castings as thin as 0.5 mm, which are rare in the world; not only can they cast rough products, but also relatively precise castings. As far as mechanical products are concerned, whether it is metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, irrigation and drainage machinery, power machinery, transportation machinery, or machine tools, most of their castings can be made by mud molding.

    Some people may think, how can the old experience of thousands of years ago still be used to serve modern industry? This is a question of how to view the ancient scientific and technological heritage of our country. It should be admitted that much of the technology from thousands of years ago is indeed outdated and has been negated by history; but it should also be seen that a large part of the scientific and technological heritage has been tested countless times in practice. This kind of scientific and technological experience was later buried for various historical reasons, or only applied in a very narrow range. In a socialist society led by the proletariat, these scientific and technological heritages have been excavated and carried forward. Mud molding technology is one such example. We should cherish these valuable heritages, actively try to use them, and gradually improve them so that they can better serve socialist construction. The machinery industry sector now needs to work hard to promote mud molding technology in accordance with this spirit to accelerate the improvement of the mechanical industry's casting capacity.

    提高铸造能力的重要途径
    刘奂
    铸造是机械生产中的第一道关。按重量计算，在一般机械产品中，铸件通常占60％到80％左右。迅速提高铸造生产能力，是保证今年机械工业更大跃进的重要一环。
    提高铸造能力的一个好办法，是根据土洋并举的方针，推广泥型铸造这一珍贵的祖国科学技术遗产。
    泥型铸造技术和现代铸造工艺中的砂型铸造方法结合起来，取新法之长，补古法之不足，使我国的造型工艺进入了一个新阶段。目前的泥型不但能作简单的铸件，而且可以作出形状相当复杂的铸件；不但可以作中、小铸件，而且可以作出十吨以上的重型零件；不但可以铸厚壁铸件，而且可以铸出世界上罕见的零点五公厘的薄壁铸件；不但可以铸粗活，也可以铸出比较精密的铸件。就机械产品来说，不论冶金设备、矿山设备、排灌机械、动力机械、交通运输机械以及机床等，其铸件大都可以用泥型铸造。
    有人也许认为，几千年前的老经验，怎么还能搬出来为现代工业服务呢？这是个如何看待祖国古代的科学技术遗产的问题。应该承认，几千年以前的技术，有许多确实是过时了，被历史否定了；但也应该看到，有很大一部分科学技术遗产，曾经经受过无数次实践的考验。这类科学技术经验，有的后来因为种种人为的历史原因被埋没了，或者只在一个很窄狭的范围内应用。在无产阶级领导的社会主义社会里，这些科学技术遗产才被发掘出来，并且发扬光大。泥型铸造技术就是如此。我们应该珍视这些宝贵的遗产，积极设法运用，并且逐步提高改进，使它们更好地为社会主义建设服务。机械工业部门现在就需要根据这样的精神，努力推广泥型铸造技术，来加速提高机械工业的铸造能力。
