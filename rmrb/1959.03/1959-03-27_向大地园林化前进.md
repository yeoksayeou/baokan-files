    Advancing Towards Landscaping the Earth
    The great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to implement the landscaping of the earth expresses the strong ambition of the Chinese people to transform the natural appearance of the motherland.
    Landscaping the earth is the long-term goal of greening the motherland. Landscaping the earth means planting various trees in all the land of the motherland according to overall planning and in accordance with local conditions. Through afforestation, we will gradually eliminate barren mountains, wasteland, and even deserts and Gobi deserts, in order to reduce natural disasters, regulate the climate, beautify the environment, and establish an environment that is both conducive to production and beneficial to people's lives. The purpose of landscaping the earth is not only to transform nature and beautify the land, but also to greatly develop the benefits of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, and to develop production. Therefore, the understanding of landscaping the earth must have a production viewpoint, and it must be recognized that landscaping the earth has production content. It not only requires the planned planting of trees in all areas that should be greened, but also requires the production of abundant forest products, so that all parts of the motherland have abundant timber, woody oil, fruits and other forest by-products to meet the growing needs of national production and construction and people's lives. Therefore, to implement landscaping the earth, it is necessary to establish bases for timber forests and economic forests according to different types of land use planning; to build necessary shelterbelts to counter various natural disasters; and to plant tree species that produce various forest products and fruits.
    The great call for landscaping the earth is put forward on the basis of afforestation work and under the premise of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. It is the long-term goal of further development of China's afforestation work. Therefore, ideologically, it must be clear that the current afforestation is for the purpose of landscaping the earth. Separating the current afforestation from landscaping the earth, considering them as two unrelated things, or one-sidedly emphasizing that landscaping the earth cannot be realized in the short term and therefore relaxing the current afforestation work, these views and practices are detrimental to the work. In order to realize landscaping the earth as soon as possible, we must seize the work of afforestation in all seasons and carry out a nationwide tree planting campaign.
    In order to implement landscaping the earth, the most important work at present is to continue to vigorously afforest, and also to focus on the following tasks. First, according to the principles of starting from production, taking into account the overall situation, adapting to local conditions, paying attention to the needs of the masses, and national characteristics, prepare for landscaping planning. Second, select key points in various types of regions, cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, and carry out demonstration and promotion. Third, vigorously collect seeds and cultivate seedlings, and prepare enough diverse and high-quality seedlings for the needs of landscaping. Fourth, carry out a technical innovation movement centered on tool reform, which will play a great role in solving the labor problem.
      "Where there is a will, there is a way." We must both have a long-term vision and focus on reality. We must ensure both key points and a comprehensive leap forward. In order to add splendor to the vast territory, make the landscape more beautiful, and build our great motherland into a rich and beautiful large park, we should seize the opportunity, closely integrate with agricultural production, and constantly set off a nationwide afforestation upsurge, and advance towards the great goal of landscaping the earth.

    向大地园林化前进
    党中央和毛主席提出的实行大地园林化的伟大号召，表达了我国人民一定要改造祖国自然面貌的雄心伟志。
    大地园林化，是绿化祖国的远大目标。所谓大地园林化，就是要在祖国全部国土上，根据全面规划，因地制宜种植各种林木，通过植树造林，逐步地消灭荒山荒地乃至沙漠戈壁，以达到减免自然灾害，调节气候，美化环境，建立起既有利于生产又有益于人们生活的环境。大地园林化的目的，既要改造自然、美化大地，又要大兴山水草木之利，发展生产。因此，对大地园林化的理解，必须具有生产观点，必须认识到大地园林化的生产内容。不仅要求把全部应该绿化的地方有计划地种起树来，而且还要求生产出丰富的林产品，使祖国各地都有丰富的木材、木本油料、果品和其它林副产品，以满足日益增长的国家生产建设和人民生活的需要。因而，实行大地园林化，必须根据不同类型的土地利用规划，建立起用材林、经济林的基地；针对各种自然灾害，营造起必要的防护林；以及栽植出产各种林产品和果品的树种。
    大地园林化这一伟大号召，是在植树造林工作的基础上、在工农业生产特别是农业生产大跃进的前提下提出来的。它是我国造林工作进一步发展的远大目标。因此，在思想上必须明确现在的植树造林，就是为了实行大地园林化。把当前的造林与大地园林化截然分开、认为是互不关联的两件事，或者是片面强调大地园林化不是短期内能实现因而就放松了当前造林工作，这些看法和做法对工作是不利的。为了早日实现大地园林化，我们必须抓紧四季造林工作，开展全民性的植树运动。
    为了实行大地园林化，当前最主要的工作是继续大力造林，同时还要抓紧下列几项工作。第一，根据从生产出发、全局着眼、因地制宜、注意群众需要、民族特点等原则，进行园林化规划的准备工作。第二，在各种类型地区选出重点，培养典型，总结经验，进行示范推广。第三，大力采种育苗，准备足够的多种多样的良种壮苗，以供园林化的需要。第四，开展以工具改革为中心的技术革新运动，这对劳力问题的解决，将起到极大的作用。
      “有志者事竟成”，我们既要高瞻远望，又要抓紧现实。既要保证重点，又要全面跃进。为了给辽阔的国土增添锦绣，让江山更加
      多娇，把我们伟大祖国建设成为一个富饶美丽的大公园，我们应该抓住时机，与农业生产密切结合，不断掀起全民性的造林高潮，向大地园林化的伟大目标前进。
