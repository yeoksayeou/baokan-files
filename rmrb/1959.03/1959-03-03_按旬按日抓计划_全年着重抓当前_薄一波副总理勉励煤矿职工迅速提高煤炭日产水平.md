    Grasp Plans by Decade and by Day, Focus on the Present Throughout the Year
    Vice Premier Bo Yibo Encourages Coal Mine Workers to Rapidly Improve Daily Coal Production Levels
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd – Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, spoke today at the National Coal Mine Workers' Red Flag Competition Radio Conference.
    Bo Yibo first extended warm congratulations to the national coal mine workers for the great victories they achieved last year. He said that last year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country conscientiously implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, achieving unprecedentedly great achievements. The coal industry also achieved brilliant victories; the total annual production was 270.2 million tons of coal, which made China's coal production jump from sixth to third place in the world, far behind Britain. This is a great victory for the Chinese working class in responding to the Party's call and striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years or less. He extended his warmest congratulations to the national coal mine workers, and wished them an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and even greater victories.
    Bo Yibo said that on the basis of the overall Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward a new and magnificent leap forward plan, requiring us to produce 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton this year. In order to complete and overfulfill these four targets and other targets, the broad masses of workers across the country are now launching a vigorous new upsurge of production and construction; the broad masses of farmers are enthusiastically engaged in the battle to win a greater harvest this summer. It is truly spring blossoms, a myriad of sights, and the situation is very good.
    Bo Yibo pointed out that in this crucial year of three years of hard work, the national coal mine workers are shouldering very important tasks. Coal production has been honorably listed as one of the four major indicators. Completing and overfulfilling this indicator is of great significance for ensuring the production of 18 million tons of steel this year and the overall leap forward of the entire national economy.
    He said that the absolute increase in coal production this year compared to last year is almost equal to twice the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period. This is a "ten-point indicator," which is formulated realistically based on various conditions, and of course, it is not easy to obtain. "You have to jump to pick the fruit." Therefore, our enthusiasm must be boosted, and it must always be boosted. We must always oppose conservatism, break down superstitions, and promote daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and use twelve points of measures and twenty-four points of enthusiasm to complete and overfulfill this indicator.
    In order to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the coal industry this year, Bo Yibo put forward three suggestions to the national coal mine workers:
    First, it is necessary to grasp plans by decade and by day, and rapidly improve the daily production level of coal nationwide, especially the daily production level of coking coal.
      "Focus on the present throughout the year." If the current production is grasped well, and the plan is completed on a ten-day and daily basis, there will be a better guarantee for completing the annual plan.
    He said that since the beginning of this year, all units that have grasped the plan on a ten-day and daily basis and firmly grasped the current production have achieved a "good start" and completed or overfulfilled the leap forward plan ahead of schedule.
    Second, to rapidly improve the daily production level of coal, it is necessary to carry out a mass movement of high production and high quality centered on technological revolution, and it is necessary to submit quarterly plans, monthly plans, ten-day plans, and daily production levels to the broad masses for discussion, disclose them to the workers, let the workers know what the current tasks are, where the problems are, and where the difficulties are, and mobilize the masses to speak out freely, contend freely, and debate extensively, ask for advice from the masses, and launch a mass movement of "everyone contributing ideas and everyone contributing suggestions," relying on the collective wisdom and strength of the masses to ensure the completion of the plan.
    He said that the more the mass movement is carried out, the more necessary it is to strengthen centralized leadership, and the more necessary it is to improve the management system. This requires leading cadres at all levels to further improve their leadership methods and leadership style, continue to conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" of the industrial constitution, go deep into the front line, go deep into the masses, grasp production, grasp ideology, and grasp life, so that economic work becomes more and more meticulous. And according to the spirit of continuous revolution, focus on the central tasks of each stage of the enterprise, put forward new fighting slogans, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so that the mass movement moves forward one climax after another, wave after wave.
    He said that the large-scale technological revolution should be taken as the central content of the mass movement. The vast majority of this year's coal production tasks must be completed by existing mines. Therefore, it is necessary to fully tap the potential of existing mines, and constantly reform technology, improve labor organization and management in all aspects such as coal mining, tunneling, stripping, and transportation, so that each mine can achieve "high production on all fronts, high production every month," and achieve large-scale bumper production.
    Bo Yibo pointed out that in last year's technological revolution movement, everyone has created many advanced experiences. These advanced experiences are valuable assets and should be vigorously promoted so that more workers can master and apply them. Doing so can rapidly improve the current production level. At present, summarizing and promoting these effective advanced experiences should be listed as an important part of the technological revolution.
    In the technological revolution, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of combining general technology and cutting-edge technology, but at present, we should focus on reforming general technology and adapting to the needs of current production and construction, and appropriately carry out research, experimentation, and promotion of cutting-edge technology, taking care of the needs of long-term development.
    Third, conscientiously implement the policy of "the whole country as a chessboard."
    He pointed out that this is the key to realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. The coal industry has close ties with various sectors of the national economy, and they must support each other and work together to complete and overfulfill the four major indicators. In order to complete 380 million tons of coal, the machinery industry department is rushing to manufacture mining equipment and coal washing equipment for the coal industry, the railway department is rushing to repair railway lines for mining areas for the coal industry, and the forestry department is transporting batches of pit props to the coal mines. Coal mine workers should also produce more coal and more good coal to support other departments, resolutely implement the state's allocation plan, and ensure that coal is supplied to other departments, especially the steel industry department, on time, with quality, and in quantity.
    Bo Yibo said that within the coal industry, it is also necessary to implement the policy of "the whole country as a chessboard," and use manpower, materials, and financial resources in a focused manner. This year, we should focus on ensuring the completion of the production task of 380 million tons of coal, with coking coal and coal washing production and construction as the focus. According to this principle, we should comprehensively arrange the production and construction work of the coal industry. Emphasize what is important and urgent. For example, the equipment obtained in the first quarter of this year should first be used in old mines and mines that were put into production last year. Basic construction projects should first build those urgently needed coking coal mines and coal washing plants, and carry out concentrated efforts in batches, building one batch and then another, trying every possible means to shorten the construction period, and putting more mines and coal washing plants into production as soon as possible. Bo Yibo pointed out that the whole country as a chessboard, centralized leadership, and unified arrangement are the most important principles of socialist construction in our country. The coal industry is a very important move in the chessboard of the whole country. The national coal mine workers must establish an overall concept of knowing the big picture and taking care of the overall situation, and resolutely obey the requirements of the whole country as a chessboard.
    Finally, Bo Yibo hoped that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the national coal mine workers will continue to give full play to their soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, work hard and skillfully, and immediately launch the red flag competition in a vigorous manner in the large-scale mass movement of high production and high quality centered on technological revolution, so that the red flag of large-scale bumper production will be planted all over the coal mines of the country.

    按旬按日抓计划  全年着重抓当前
    薄一波副总理勉励煤矿职工迅速提高煤炭日产水平
    新华社2日讯　国务院副总理薄一波今天在全国煤矿职工红旗竞赛广播大会上讲了话。
    薄一波首先向全国煤矿职工去年取得的伟大胜利表示热烈祝贺。他说，去年，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，认真贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，取得了空前伟大的成就，煤炭工业也取得了辉煌的胜利；全年一共生产了两亿七千零二十万吨煤，使我国的煤炭产量从世界第六位一下子跳到第三位，把英国远远地抛在后面。这是我国工人阶级响应党的号召，争取在十五年或者更短一点的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的斗争中，取得的伟大胜利。他向全国煤矿职工致以最热烈的祝贺，并且预祝他们在今年实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，取得更加伟大的胜利。
    薄一波说，在1958年全面大跃进的基础上，党的八届六中全会又给我们提出了新的宏伟的跃进计划，要求我们在今年生产一千八百万吨钢、三亿八千万吨煤、一万零五百亿斤粮食和一亿担棉花。为了完成和超额完成这四项指标和其他指标，现在全国广大职工正在掀起一个蓬蓬勃勃的生产建设新高潮；广大农民热火朝天地投入了争取今年夏季更大丰收的战斗。真是春暖花开，气象万千，形势很好。
    薄一波指出，在这苦战三年具有决定意义的一年中，全国煤矿职工担负着很重要的任务。煤炭产量光荣地被列为四大指标之一。完成和超额完成这个指标，对确保今年生产一千八百万吨钢和整个国民经济的全面跃进，有着重大的意义。
    他说，今年煤炭产量比去年增长的绝对数，差不多等于第一个五年计划期间增长总数的一倍。这是“十分指标”，是实事求是地根据各方面的条件制定的，当然也不是轻易可以拿到手的，“要跳一跳才能把果子摘下来”。因此，我们的干劲必须鼓足，而且永远要鼓足，永远要反对保守、破除迷信、提倡敢想、敢说、敢干，用十二分措施和二十四分干劲来完成和超额完成这个指标。
    为了实现今年煤炭工业更大、更好、更全面的跃进，薄一波向全国煤矿职工提出了三点意见：
    第一，要按旬、按日抓计划，迅速提高全国煤炭的日产水平，特别是炼焦煤的日产水平。
      “全年着重抓当前”。抓好了当前的生产，按旬按日地完成计划，完成全年计划就有了更好的保证。
    他说，今年以来，凡是按旬按日抓计划，狠狠地抓当前生产的单位，都实现了“开门红”，提前或者超额完成了跃进计划。
    第二，要迅速提高煤炭的日产水平，必须大搞以技术革命为中心的高产高质的群众运动，必须把季度计划、月计划、旬计划和日产水平，交给广大群众讨论，向工人交底，让工人都知道当前的任务是什么、问题在哪里，困难在哪里，发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，问计于群众，掀起一个“人人献计、人人献策”的群众运动，依靠群众的集体智慧和力量来保证计划的完成。
    他说，群众运动越开展，越需要加强集中领导，越需要健全管理制度。这就要求各级领导干部进一步改进领导方法和领导作风，继续认真执行“两参、一改、三结合”的工业宪法，深入现场，深入群众，既抓生产、又抓思想、又抓生活，使经济工作越做越细致。并且根据不断革命的精神，针对企业每个阶段的中心任务，提出新的战斗口号，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，使群众运动一个高潮接着一个高潮、一浪推一浪地向前发展。
    他说，应该把大闹技术革命作为群众运动的中心内容。今年的煤炭生产任务，绝大部分要靠现在的矿井来完成，因此，必须充分挖掘现有矿井的潜在能力，在采煤、掘进、剥离、运输等各个环节，不断地革新技术、改进劳动组织和管理，使每个矿井都能达到“面面高产、月月高产”，实现大面积丰产。
    薄一波指出，在去年的技术革命运动中，大家已经创造了很多先进经验。这些先进经验都是宝贵的财富，应该大力推广，让更多的职工能够掌握运用，这样做，能够迅速提高当前的生产水平。目前，总结推广这些行之有效的先进经验，应该列为技术革命的一项重要内容。
    在技术革命中，要认真贯彻一般技术和尖端技术相结合的方针，而目前，应该以改革一般技术、适应当前生产建设需要为主，适当地进行尖端技术的研究、试验和推广，照顾长远发展的需要。
    第三，认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针。
    他指出，这是实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进的关键。煤炭工业和国民经济各个部门有着密切的联系，必须互相支援，同心协力，才能完成和超额完成四大指标。为了完成三亿八千万吨煤，机械工业部门正在为煤炭工业突击制造矿山设备和洗煤设备，铁路部门正在为煤炭工业赶修矿区用的铁路线，林业部门正在把一批批的坑木运给煤矿。煤矿职工们也应该多产煤、多产好煤支援其他部门，坚决执行国家的调拨计划，保证按时、按质、按量把煤炭供应其他部门，特别是钢铁工业部门。
    薄一波说，在煤炭工业内部，也必须贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，有重点地使用人力、物力、财力。今年，应该以确保完成三亿八千万吨煤的生产任务为重点，其中又以炼焦煤和洗煤的生产建设为重点，根据这个原则，来全面安排煤炭工业的生产建设工作。重其所重，急其所急。比如，今年第一季度拿到手的器材，要首先用到旧井和去年新投入生产的矿井上去。基本建设工程，要先建那些急需的炼焦煤、矿井和洗煤厂，分批突击，建成一批再建一批，千方百计缩短工期，使更多的矿井和洗煤厂及早投入生产。薄一波指出，全国一盘棋，集中领导和统一安排，是我国社会主义建设最重要的原则。煤炭工业是全国一盘棋当中很重要的一着棋。全国煤矿职工必须树立识大体、顾大局的整体观念，坚决服从全国一盘棋的要求。
    薄一波最后希望全国煤矿职工在党中央和毛主席的领导下，继续发挥冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧，实干苦干巧干，在大规模的以技术革命为中心的高产高质的群众运动中，马上把红旗竞赛轰轰烈烈地开展起来，让大面积丰产的红旗插遍全国煤矿。
