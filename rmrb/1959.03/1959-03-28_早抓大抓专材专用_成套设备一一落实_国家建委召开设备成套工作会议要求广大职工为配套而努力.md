Xinhua News Agency, March 27th – Under the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's national economy, a large number of industrial and mining enterprises will be completed and put into production this year and every year thereafter. How to more effectively manufacture the complete sets of equipment needed by these enterprises has become a major strategic issue in China's current economic construction. The State Basic Construction Commission recently convened a special meeting to comprehensively discuss this issue. The meeting demanded that workers in the national industrial, transportation, and financial sectors must continue to exert their utmost efforts, strive for the top, and shoulder the glorious task of manufacturing and supplying complete sets of equipment for thousands of industrial and mining enterprises.

Participants in the meeting included leaders from the State Construction Commission, the Planning Commission, the Economic Commission, and relevant ministries of industry and transportation, as well as inspection teams sent by the central government to various key areas to inspect equipment complete set work.

The meeting believes that after the Party's economic construction policy and the national plan are determined, equipment complete set work is a basic condition for ensuring the completion and commissioning of industrial and mining enterprises. Doing this work well can greatly accelerate the development speed of China's industrial construction and industrial production. The meeting affirmed that the achievements in equipment complete set work in 1958 were tremendous. It played a significant role in ensuring the overall leap forward in production and construction last year, especially in ensuring the completion of the task of 11 million tons of steel. Nearly 700 industrial and mining enterprises above the quota were completed and partially completed and put into production last year, exceeding the total number during the First Five-Year Plan period. China has successfully manufactured some large-scale complete sets of equipment with modern standards on its own, and has achieved preliminary results in implementing the Party's construction policy of mainly relying on self-reliance. However, since China's machinery manufacturing industry is transitioning from mainly relying on importing main engines from abroad and domestic supporting equipment to mainly manufacturing main engines and auxiliary machines in complete sets and in large quantities on its own, it is natural to encounter certain difficulties in this transition process. The meeting believes that as long as we earnestly implement the Party's general line, strengthen leadership, and vigorously launch mass movements, all difficulties can be overcome.

In order to do a good job in equipment complete set work and ensure that the industrial and mining enterprises scheduled to be completed in this year's national plan are completed and put into production as soon as possible, the meeting decided to take the following measures: First, we must conscientiously solve the problem of equipment that was not completed in 1958. Enterprises or workshops that have been basically completed in 1958 and have important production tasks in 1959 should be given priority for complete sets. Weak links in factories and mines that have been completed and put into production should be quickly filled to maximize their production capacity. Second, when arranging the manufacture of complete sets of equipment, the machinery manufacturing department must ensure that auxiliary machines and accessories are compatible with the main engine. And, as far as possible, manufacture in batches and in complete sets on schedule according to the order of project construction and construction progress. Third, organize the supply of complete sets of equipment with construction projects as the target, so that the supply of complete sets of equipment for important construction projects is fully implemented one by one. Fourth, materials for manufacturing complete sets of equipment must be guaranteed for special materials for special use, and no department or region may misappropriate them. Fifth, under the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," the production of the national machinery industry should be unified and arranged, and the First Ministry of Machine Building must assume the responsibility of the general management department for national machinery production.

To ensure complete sets of equipment, a series of organizational work must also be done well. From the central government to the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, equipment complete set companies should be quickly established to be responsible for organizing the supply of complete sets of equipment required for construction projects included in the national plan. For a considerable number of large, bulky, and simple non-standard equipment, the construction unit should manufacture them on-site and entrust nearby machinery factories to process them. In order to clarify the scope of complete sets of equipment supply for factories, it is necessary to immediately compile a general catalog of complete sets of equipment for various types of factories and several classification catalogs.

The standardization of mechanical products can reduce the difficulty of complete sets of equipment and accelerate the speed of industrial construction. The meeting proposed that, first of all, machine products that have been proven to be suitable for China's needs, economical, and reasonable should be designated as standard products; then, the current many non-standard products should be gradually standardized in a step-by-step manner. In the design of industrial and mining enterprises, standard equipment should be used as much as possible.

The meeting believes that equipment complete set work is extremely complex. To do this work well, it is far from enough to rely solely on the strength of the machinery manufacturing and basic construction departments. Therefore, the meeting requested the State Planning Commission, the Economic Commission, the Construction Commission, the industrial and transportation ministries, the party committees of various localities, and relevant departments to divide responsibilities under the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," with each industry and trade grasping the work to the end, and grasping the equipment complete set work early and on a large scale. At the same time, it is necessary to widely mobilize all the workers of production units, construction units, design units, and supply units, fully promote the communist spirit, and vigorously complete the collaborative tasks of manufacturing complete sets of equipment.

    早抓大抓专材专用
    成套设备一一落实
    国家建委召开设备成套工作会议要求广大职工为配套而努力
    新华社27日讯　在我国国民经济全面大跃进的局面下，今年和今后每年都将有大量的工矿企业建成并且投入生产，如何更有成效地制造这些企业所需要的成套设备，已成为我国目前经济建设中的一个具有战略性的重大问题。国家基本建设委员会不久前专门召开会议全面地讨论了这个问题。会议要求，全国工业交通财经部门职工必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，担负起为成千的工矿企业制造和供应成套设备的光荣任务。
    参加这次会议的有国家建委、计委、经委和工业交通有关各部等方面的负责人，以及中央派往各个重点地区检查设备成套工作的检查组。
    会议认为，在党的经济建设方针和国家计划确定之后，设备成套工作是保证工矿企业建成并且投入生产的基本条件。把这一工作做好，就可以大大加快我国工业建设和工业生产的发展速度。会议肯定了1958年设备成套工作的成绩是巨大的。对于保证去年生产和建设的全面跃进，特别是对于保证完成一千一百万吨钢的任务起了很大的作用。去年建成和部分建成而投入生产的限额以上的工矿企业近七百个，超过了第一个五年计划期间的总和。我国自己成功地制成了一些具有现代化水平的大型成套设备，在贯彻执行党的以自力更生为主的建设方针上，已取得了初步的成绩。但是，由于我国的机械制造工业，正在从过去主要依靠由国外进口主机，国内配套，开始转变为主要由自己成套地、大量地制造主机和辅机，在这样的转变过程中，产生一定的困难是很自然的。会议认为，只要我们切实贯彻执行党的总路线，抓紧领导、大搞群众运动，一切困难都是可以克服的。
    为了做好设备成套工作，确保今年国家计划规定建成的工矿企业及早建成并投入生产，会议决定采取以下措施：一、首先要认真解决1958年没有成套的设备问题。1958年已经基本建成，而在1959年有重要生产任务的企业或车间，都应当优先配套。已经建成投入生产的厂矿的薄弱环节，应当迅速补上，以发挥它们的生产能力。二、机械制造部门在安排成套设备的制造的时候，必须使辅机、配件与主机相适应。并且尽可能根据建设项目排队的先后和建设进度，分批制造，按期成套。三、以建设项目为对象，组织成套设备的供应，使重要建设项目的成套设备供应，一一落实。四、制造成套设备的材料必须保证专材专用，任何部门和地方，不得挪用。五、在“全国一盘棋”的方针下，统一安排全国机械工业的生产，第一机械工业部必须担负起全国机械生产的总管部门的责任。
    要保证设备成套，还必须做好一系列的组织工作。从中央到各省市区都应迅速成立设备成套公司，负责组织供应列入国家计划以内的建设项目所需要的成套设备。对于不少的庞大笨重的和制作简单的非标准设备，应当由建设单位在现场制作和委托附近的机械厂加工。为了明确工厂成套设备供应的范围，必须立即编制各类工厂的成套设备总目录和几种分类目录。
    机械产品的标准化可以减少设备成套的困难，加快工业建设的速度。会议提出，首先应把经过使用证明适合于我国需要的、经济合理的机器产品定为标准产品；然后有步骤地把现在的很多非标准产品逐步使它标准化。在工矿企业的设计中，要尽量采用标准设备。
    会议认为设备成套工作极其复杂，要做好这一工作，单靠机械制造和基本建设部门的力量是远远不够的，因此，会议要求国家计委、经委、建委，工业、交通各部，各地方党委和有关部门，在“全国一盘棋”的方针下，分工负责，一行一业分行分业抓到底，早抓、大抓设备成套工作。同时要广泛发动生产单位、施工单位、设计单位、供应单位的全体职工，充分发扬共产主义精神，大力完成成套设备制造的协作任务。（附图片）
