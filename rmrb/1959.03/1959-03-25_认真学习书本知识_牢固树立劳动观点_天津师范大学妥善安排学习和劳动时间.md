Conscientiously Study Book Knowledge and Firmly Establish a Labor Viewpoint
Tianjin Normal University Properly Arranges Study and Labor Time

    (Our report) Tianjin – Conscientiously studying books and diligently laboring have become the new style of learning at Tianjin Normal University.
    Since the school implemented the Party's education policy, a vigorous and thriving situation has emerged, and the ideological outlook of teachers and students has undergone extremely profound changes. In order to better integrate study and labor, the school Party committee promptly put forward the slogan of "attaching importance to both practice and theory; being able to actively participate in productive labor, and also being able to sit down and study with peace of mind."
    Subsequently, study and productive labor time were properly arranged, and it was determined that there should be two months of labor each year. According to the characteristics of a normal university, this labor is divided into three types. One is comprehensive productive labor, through which students master the basic production knowledge that they should possess as future secondary school teachers and cultivate students' labor viewpoint. The second is voluntary labor. The third is productive labor combined with their major. Productive labor combined with their major is mostly carried out together with the study of theoretical knowledge. For example, second-year students in the Physics Department go to automobile repair factories and electrician repair factories to participate in productive labor while studying "Heat Engineering" and "Electrical Engineering" courses. The Chinese and History Departments also combine the study of courses such as "Modern History" and "Modern Revolutionary History" with social investigations in factories, mines, and rural areas, while laboring with workers and peasants, with very good results. In terms of classroom learning, it is also stipulated that at least eight months of study time must be guaranteed each year. In this regard, some effective measures have also been taken, such as ensuring students' self-study time, strengthening teachers' tutoring, establishing student self-study groups, as well as establishing necessary teaching systems such as a study attendance system, examination and assessment system, and teaching inspection system.
    Now, labor production has become an integral part of the teaching plan of Tianjin Normal University. The new trend of conscientiously reading and learning knowledge has also greatly developed. According to a survey by the library, the number of various professional books borrowed by students has increased significantly. In the past two weeks, forty-four second-year students in the Geography Department bought more than 270 geography professional reference books and more than 180 political theory books. Every student diligently seizes the time to study, not letting time go to waste. Second-year students in the Chemistry Department have organized nine self-study groups. After listening to teachers' lectures, they study collectively, read reference books separately, raise questions, and often discuss together, inspiring and helping each other. At the same time, they also help each other politically. For example, after they collectively read the book "Old Communist Youth League Member," they held discussions in the group about their gains and feelings, which was very effective. Now, in class, students generally listen attentively, hand in assignments on time, review carefully after class, and settle down to study hard. Teachers have also strengthened their sense of responsibility, preparing lessons and tutoring students' self-study conscientiously, and humbly listening to students' opinions on teaching, determined to teach the books well.

    认真学习书本知识　牢固树立劳动观点
    天津师范大学妥善安排学习和劳动时间
    本报讯　踏踏实实地读书，勤勤恳恳地劳动，已经成为天津师范大学的新学风。
    这个学校自从贯彻党的教育方针以后，出现了生气勃勃的跃进局面，师生的思想面貌发生了极其深刻的变化。为了使学习和劳动更好地结合起来，学校党委会及时提出了“既重视实践，又重视理论；既能积极参加生产劳动，又能坐下来安心读书”的口号。
    接着妥善地安排了学习和生产劳动的时间，确定每年要有两个月的劳动。这些劳动根据师范大学的特点分为三种。一种是综合生产劳动，通过这种劳动使学生掌握将来作为中等学校教师应该具备的基础生产知识，并培养学生的劳动观点；第二种是义务劳动；第三种是结合专业的生产劳动。结合专业的生产劳动多数是和学习理论知识一起进行的。例如物理系二年级学生到汽车修配厂和电工修配厂一面参加生产劳动，一面学习“热工学”和“电工学”课程。中文系和历史系也结合“近代史”、“现代革命史”等课程的学习，一面下厂矿、下农村作社会调查，一面同工人农民一起劳动，效果都很好。在课堂学习方面，也规定了每年必须保证有八个月的学习时间。在这方面也采取了一些有效措施，例如保证学生的自学时间、加强教师的辅导、建立学生自学小组以及建立学习考勤制度、考试考查制度、教学检查制度等必要的教学制度。
    现在，劳动生产已经成为天津师范大学教学计划中的组成部分。认真读书、学习知识的新风气，也有了很大发展。据图书馆的调查，学生借阅各种专业书籍的数量有了显著增加。地理系二年级的四十四名学生，在最近两周内就买了二百七十多本地理专业参考书和一百八十多本政治理论书籍，每个学生都认真抓紧时间读书，不使时间白白地浪费过去。化学系二年级的学生自己组织了九个自学小组，他们在听了教师讲课以后，就集体学习，分头看参考书，提问题，经常在一起讨论，互相启发帮助，同时，他们还在政治上互相帮助，例如，他们集体阅读了“老共青团员”一书以后，就在小组里座谈收获和感想，效果非常好。现在上课时，学生们一般都能认真听讲，按时交作业，下课后认真复习，安下心来刻苦读书。教师们也加强了责任心，认真备课和辅导学生自学，并且虚心听取学生对教学方面的意见，决心把书教好。　（黄人晓、朱泽民）
