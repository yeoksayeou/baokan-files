Just Right, Twice the Result with Half the Effort

　　Handling anything requires being just right, and this is also true in agricultural production. The Wuxing People's Commune in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, has formulated specific close-planting standards for rice in different fields this year; the Guoguang Commune in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, applies different fertilizers according to different soil types, different crops, and different growth stages; Qin County has comprehensively formulated the 1959 "Agricultural Almanac," making the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture more specific and localized. These measures are due to the fact that various regions have earnestly summarized the experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward, and have thus grasped an important principle: to carry out agricultural production in accordance with local conditions, time, and crops.

　　It is extremely important to adapt agricultural production to local conditions, timing, and crops. Only by scientifically and meticulously mastering this principle can the "Eight-Character Charter" fully demonstrate its effectiveness and achieve twice the result with half the effort. As long as we continuously summarize production experience, we can skillfully apply the "Eight-Character Charter" and achieve even greater agricultural harvests.

    恰到好处，事半功倍
    处理任何事物要恰到好处，在农业生产上也是如此。福建南安县五星人民公社订出今年水稻在不同田地的密植规格；山西阳高县国光公社，根据不同土壤、不同作物、不同生长期施用不同肥料；沁县全面制订1959年“农事皇历”，使农业“八字宪法”更加具体化、地方化。这些措施，是由于各地认真总结了去年大跃进的经验，因而抓住了一条重要的规律：因地因时因作物制宜来进行农业生产。
    农业生产上要因地因时因作物制宜，这一点十分重要。只有科学地细致地掌握了这一条规律，才能够使“八字宪法”大显神通，事半功倍。只要不断地总结生产经验，就能够巧妙地运用“八字宪法”，就能取得更大的农业丰收。
