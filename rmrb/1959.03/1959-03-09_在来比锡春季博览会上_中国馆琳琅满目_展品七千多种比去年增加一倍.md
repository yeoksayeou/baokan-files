Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 6th: The Leipzig Spring Fair has been a great success in the six days since it opened. According to statistics from the fair's management, the number of visitors in the first three days has already exceeded 170,000.

In the industrial technology exhibition section of the Leipzig Fair, the Chinese Pavilion is one of the most closely watched targets for visitors. Although the industrial technology exhibition is concentrated, it still takes three days to browse through it once.

Many of the fair's visitors are regular customers who come every year. This year, they were surprised as soon as they arrived in front of the Chinese Pavilion. Chinese-made agricultural machinery, buses, diesel engines, and other items were displayed for the first time in the outdoor square outside the pavilion. At the entrance of the Chinese Pavilion, instead of the traditional silks and textiles, there were new-style machine tools and various steel samples. Inside the pavilion, huge charts showing the growth of China's steel, grain, coal, machinery, electricity, and other industries last year hung on the walls. In the constant flow of people, one could constantly hear voices in various languages saying, "The changes in China are really too great."

This year, the Chinese Pavilion at the Leipzig Fair exhibited more than 7,000 exhibits, almost double the number from last year. Among them, heavy industrial products, precision instruments, and precision machines accounted for more than 60% of all exhibits.

    在来比锡春季博览会上
    中国馆琳琅满目
    展品七千多种比去年增加一倍
    据新华社来比锡6日电　来比锡春季博览会开放六天以来盛况空前。根据博览会管理机构的统计，头三天的参观人数已经超过了十七万。
    在来比锡博览会的工业技术展览部分中，中国馆是最受参观者注意的目标之一。博览会的工业技术展览虽然集中，但浏览一遍也需三天时间。
    博览会的观众中，许多都是每年必来的老客人。今年他们一到中国馆门前就感到惊异。中国制造的农业机器、公共汽车、柴油机等第一次陈列在馆外的露天广场上。在中国馆进口处展出的不再是传统的丝绸、纺织品；而是新式的工作母机和各种钢材样品。馆内墙上还挂着去年中国钢、粮食、煤、机械、电力等增长情况的巨幅图表。在川流不息的人群中，随时可以听到用各种不同语言发出的“中国的变化真是太大了”的声音。
    今年来比锡博览会上的中国馆共展出了七千多种展品，比去年几乎增加一倍。其中重工业产品、精密仪器和精密机器等占全部展品的60％以上。
