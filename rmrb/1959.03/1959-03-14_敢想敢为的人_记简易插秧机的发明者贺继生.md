A Man of Bold Imagination and Action
    ——Remembering He Jisheng, the Inventor of the Simple Rice Transplanter
    By Our Correspondents Hu Jian and Li Guohua
    Recently, at the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Work Conference, a young farmer with "muddy legs" stood on the stage and gave a report to more than 1,200 professors and scientific workers on the structural principles and usage methods of the simple rice transplanter.
    The speaker was He Jisheng, a member of the Qingshui River People's Commune in Liling County and a Communist Party member, who created the simple rice transplanter. This young farmer, who had only attended school for half a year, under the inspiration of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction during the Great Leap Forward in Production last year, finally trial-produced the first bamboo and wood structure simple rice transplanter on July 6th last year after more than four months of repeated experiments. The experimental results of this rice transplanter showed that it improved work efficiency by about three times compared to manual transplanting. In September last year, this rice transplanter participated in the performance competition at the National Rice Transplanter Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture in Nanjing, and was rated as one of the five better rice transplanters in the country. Its advantages are: bamboo and wood structure, simple to manufacture, high work efficiency, low cost, good quality, lightweight and flexible, suitable for use in large and small fields, mountainous areas and plains.
     "Swan Meat" Can Also Be Eaten By People
    A few days ago, we visited this farmer inventor with admiration. When he understood our intention, he repeatedly said modestly:
    "It's all because of the Party's leadership and the support of the masses."
    It was last spring. In March, the Qingshui River Agricultural Cooperative set a target of doubling rice production per mu to 1,000 catties, requiring dense planting to be changed from 8×8 inches to 3×5 inches. With such density, all the labor force would have to transplant for more than twenty days, and it would be difficult to catch up with the season. Some people wavered about dense planting. However, He Jisheng expressed his determination to the Party: he must make a rice transplanter.
    The news of He Jisheng's manufacturing of a rice transplanter quickly spread. Most people in the cooperative knew that He Jisheng was a clever person, but they were still skeptical about the idea of manufacturing a rice transplanter. However, people still held an enthusiastic and supportive attitude. A few conservatives, however, made some cold remarks, saying, "Wanting to invent a rice transplanter is like a weasel wanting to eat swan meat," "Isn't it just young people wanting to show off!" These harsh words made He Jisheng feel somewhat disheartened. Zhang Donglin, the Party branch secretary, knew that He Jisheng was an impatient person, so he patiently encouraged him, saying, "Swan meat can also be eaten by people."
     A Wooden Comb
    He Jisheng repeatedly pondered the words of the Party branch secretary.
    In the evening, he sat under a small oil lamp and began to draw designs. He drew everything he came into contact with in his life. According to the rollers of the marker, he designed a roller-type rice transplanter, but it failed. He thought of all the tables and chairs in the room, even the children's chairs and cradles, and drew them all, but he couldn't solve the problem of clamping and separating seedlings. At dawn, his wife, Ding Xuemei, got up to cook, walked to the dressing table, and saw He Jisheng still sitting there drawing non-stop, full of anger. While holding the wooden comb, she complained, "Look at you, you're crazy, you're possessed, you don't eat, you don't sleep, can these things you draw be eaten?" He Jisheng didn't say a word, just stared blankly at his wife combing her hair. The wooden comb combed large amounts of hair, flicking it back, and the wooden comb clamped the hair very tightly, sometimes making clacking sounds. When he was watching intently, his wife threw the wooden comb on the table and left. He Jisheng picked up the wooden comb, looked at it again and again, and combed his own hair, as if he had discovered an oasis in the desert. "That's right! A wooden comb can clamp hair, and it can also clamp seedlings." He ran to carpenter Zhang Youqiu's house with the wooden comb. They designed and manufactured a comb-style rice transplanter according to the style of the wooden comb. The results of the test transplanting showed that although it could transplant rice, the seedling separation was uneven, it damaged the seedlings, and it leaked seedlings, so it was still unusable. At this time, many commune members put forward many suggestions for improvement. Elderly commune member Ding Wusheng suggested, "It would be good if we could use something to clamp it." This sentence greatly inspired He Jisheng.
          Hands, Omnipotent Hands
    In late May, the township convened a meeting of Party members to implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, requiring everyone to promote the communist new style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Township Party Secretary Wu Jinyuan's speech struck He Jisheng's heart, and he felt that he had not completed his task and had let the Party down. His face flushed, and he sat silently in the corner, muttering to himself the words of the old commune member Ding Wusheng: "It would be good if we could find something to clamp it." Suddenly, Secretary Wu shook his hand while speaking. He Jisheng connected these two things together, thought about it again and again: "Right! Hands, these are the omnipotent hands." He helped the landlord's family look after cattle from the age of nine, and then went to the fields to transplant rice. He has been transplanting for more than twenty years, and his hands have been covered with countless blisters. Why did he forget his own two hands? As he thought, the three fingers of his right hand began to imitate the appearance of transplanting rice. He stared blankly at his three fingers, and silently asked and answered himself: "Yes, transplanting rice uses these three fingers to clamp and separate the seedlings. If two movable wooden pieces are used to replace them, wouldn't the problem of the seedling clamp be solved?" The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was right.
            The Secret of the Fire Tongs
    He Jisheng rushed back to the cooperative overnight, without even entering his house, and went to carpenter Zhang Youqiu's house to start the trial production.
    When they transformed the comb-style rice transplanter into a seedling clamp, the first problem they encountered was how to open these seedling clamps at the same time, without any deviation? Only in this way could one pair of hands be turned into ten pairs of hands, or even dozens of pairs of hands, in order to improve work efficiency.
    For this problem, He Jisheng racked his brains for several nights. One morning, he was helping his wife make a fire and cook, and saw that the fire tongs opened and closed freely, which was very interesting. He thought, if all the seedling clamps were changed to fire tongs-style opening and closing, wouldn't it be possible for one person to operate them? When he thought of this, he didn't even eat breakfast, and ran to discuss it with Zhang Youqiu, and they started making it according to the style of the fire tongs.
    The two of them worked hard all night, and made the first rice transplanting clamp according to the style of clamping seedlings with three fingers, using the lever principle of the fire tongs opening and closing. At the beginning, it could transplant four seedlings at a time, and later the clamping teeth were gradually increased, and it could transplant more than twenty seedlings at a time. However, because the seedling clamps were initially made of wood, they were easily worn and sometimes couldn't clamp the seedlings, and would also leak seedlings. He Jisheng's old father, He Yifang, then made a good suggestion. He said: "Bamboo strips are wear-resistant and durable enough to be comparable to steel after being fried. In the past, pushers used this thing for teeth. It's best to replace them with bamboo strips to make the clamping teeth." His suggestion was adopted. The seedling clamp is composed of two parts: the clamping teeth and the left and right handles. It is equivalent to a right hand when transplanting rice manually, and is the main component of the simple rice transplanter. The successful trial production of the seedling clamp meant that the rice transplanter was half successful.
	  Still Need a "Left Hand"
    However, the seedling clamp could only replace one right hand. When transplanting rice manually, the right hand transplants the seedlings, and the left hand takes the seedlings and assists in separating them. The two hands must cooperate to perform transplanting. Therefore, the problem turned to how to add a left hand to the rice transplanter.
    They used ash boats to hold the seedlings, and used seedling clamps to clamp the seedlings for transplanting. The ash boat could hold the seedlings, but it could not separate or send the seedlings. Therefore, when clamping, the base of the seedlings could not be clamped neatly, and they were transplanted incorrectly. Sometimes too many or too few seedlings were clamped, and there were also cases of missing seedlings.
    He Jisheng began to rack his brains to break through the last hurdle. One day, he was drawing water and found that the dragon bone cart leaves rotated very regularly. He thought, if the ash boat was modified into a seedling box, and a seedling pressing plate was installed in the form of cart leaves to slowly send the seedlings to the seedling clamp guide plate, wouldn't the problems of sending and separating seedlings be solved? Wouldn't this clever seedling box be able to add a left hand to the rice transplanter? As he thought, he forgot that he was drawing water, jumped off the waterwheel, and ran to Zhang Youqiu's house in one breath. The two of them picked up saws and planes and started working.
    The problem came again. The dragon bone cart leaves are rotated by stepping on them. What should be used to drive the seedling pressing plate to move slowly? The two of them discussed that it would be good if two elastic belts could be installed on both ends of the seedling box to drive it. He Jisheng quickly ran home, took his pair of rubber shoes, cut them into belts, and installed them. The experimental results were very good. The seedling pressing box slowly pushed the seedlings to the downward sloping seedling clamp guide plate. One person operated the seedling clamp, opened the clamping teeth, and placed them along the slope of the guide plate, which happened to clamp the base of the seedlings and transplant the seedlings neatly into the field.
    The two main components of the rice transplanter—the seedling clamp and the seedling box—were made. That is to say, the rice transplanter had both left and right hands, and the problems of clamping and separating seedlings were solved. Later, according to the suggestions of the masses, they made a seedling box frame to integrate the two main components mentioned above. A boat-shaped mud-dragging plate was installed under the seedling box frame to slide in the paddy field for transplanting.
    In this way, from March of last year, He Jisheng and carpenter Zhang Youqiu, after more than four months of hard work, finally trial-produced the first rice transplanter. This initially solved a difficult problem in realizing mechanization in paddy fields.
    Now, the rice transplanter created by He Jisheng has not only begun to be promoted in Hunan Province, but also some rice-growing areas across the country have begun to adopt it.

    敢想敢为的人
    ——记简易插秧机的发明者贺继生
    本报记者　胡坚　李国华
    最近，在湖南省科学技术工作会议上，一位“黑脚杆子”的青年农民站上讲台，向一千二百多名教授、科学工作者作关于简易插秧机的结构原理和使用方法的报告。
    这位报告人，就是简易插秧机的创造者、醴陵县清水江人民公社社员、共产党员贺继生。这是一位仅仅读过半年书的青年农民，在去年生产大跃进中，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，经过四个多月的反复试验，在去年7月6日终于试制成第一部竹木结构的简易插秧机。这部插秧机试验结果，比人工插秧提高工效三倍左右。去年9月，这部插秧机参加了农业部在南京召开的全国插秧机会议上的表演比赛，被评为目前全国比较好的五台插秧机中的一部。它的优点是：竹木结构，简单易造，工效高，成本低，质量好，轻便灵巧，大田小田、山区平原都可以使用。
      “天鹅肉”也是人吃的
    几天前，我们怀着敬佩的心情，访问了这位农民发明家。当他了解到我们的来意时，再三谦逊地说：
  “都是因为有党的领导，群众的支持。”
    那是去年春天的事。3月间，清水江农业社订出亩产双千斤的水稻丰产计划，要求密植由8×8寸改为3×5寸。这样密，全部劳动力要插二十多天，还难赶上季节。一些人对密植动摇了。可是贺继生却向党表示决心：一定要制成插秧机。
    贺继生制造插秧机的消息很快传出去了。社里多数人了解贺继生是个心眼灵巧的人，但毕竟对想制造插秧机的事半信半疑，可是人们还是抱着热情赞同的态度。少数保守派，却放出一些冷言冷语，说什么“想发明插秧机，真是黄鼠狼想天鹅肉吃”，“还不是年青人想出风头！”这些刺耳的话，弄得贺继生有些心灰意懒了。党支部书记张冬林知道贺继生是个急性人，就耐心的鼓励他，对他说：“天鹅肉，也是人吃的”。
      一把木梳子
    贺继生反复回味着党支部书记说的话。
    晚上，他坐在一盏小油灯下面，开始画图样。凡是他生活接触到的东西，他见一桩，画一桩。按照划行器的滚子，他设计过滚筒式插秧机，失败了。他把房里摆的桌凳，连小孩坐的椅子、摇篮都想到了，画尽了，可是怎么也不能解决夹秧、分秧问题。天亮了，他的爱人丁雪梅起床煮饭，走到梳妆台前，看到贺继生还坐在那里画个不停，满肚子火气。她一边拿着木梳子，一边发着无名气：“看你，发了疯，着了魔，饭也不吃，觉也不睡，画这些东西，能当饭吃么？”贺继生没有哼一声，只是呆呆地望着妻子梳头发，木梳子把大把的头发，梳得向后面甩，木梳子夹着头发很有劲，有时还咯咯地作响。当他看得出神的时候，妻子把木梳子向桌上一丢，就走了。贺继生拿起木梳子，看了又看，在自己的头上梳了又梳，他好像在沙漠里发现绿洲样的。“对了！木梳子能夹住头发，也能夹住秧苗。”他拿着木梳子往木工张友秋家里跑，他们按照木梳子的式样，又设计制造了一部梳子式的插秧机。试插结果，虽然能插秧，但是分秧不匀，伤秧，又漏秧，还是不能用。这时许多社员提出许多改进的意见。老年社员丁武生提出：“要能用一个东西夹住就好了”。这句话给贺继生的启发很大。
          手，万能的手
    5月下旬，乡里召开党员大会，贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，要求大家发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义新风格。乡党委书记吴金元的讲话，一句句打在贺继生的心坎上，他感到自己没有完成任务，对不起党。他脸上一阵阵发烧，呆呆地坐在屋角里，独自在念着老社员丁武生那句话：“要是能找个东西把它夹住就好了。”猛一下，吴书记讲话时把手晃动了一下，贺继生把这两件事联在一起，想了又想：“对！手，就是这双万能的手。”他从9岁起帮地主家看牛，就下田插秧。插到现在已经插了二十多年，手上不知插起过多少血泡，为什么倒把一双手忘了呢？他想着想着，右手的三个指头，就做起插秧的样子，他呆呆地望着三个指头出了神，独个默默地自问自答：“是呀，插秧用这三个指头夹秧又分秧，要是两个活动的木片片来代替它，不是秧夹的问题就解决了么？”他越想越对头。
            火钳的秘密
    贺继生连夜赶回社里，连家门也没有进，就到木工张友秋家动手试制起来。
    当他们把梳式插秧机改装成秧夹时，碰到的第一个问题是，如何能使这些秧夹同时启开，不差分毫呢？只有这样才能把一双手长成十双手，甚至几十双手，才能提高工效。
    为了这个问题，贺继生苦思了好几个晚上。一天早上，他正帮着爱人烧火弄饭，看到火钳启闭自如，很有意思，他想，如果把秧夹都变成火钳式的启闭，不是由一个人操作就行么？当他想到这里，早饭也不吃，跑去和张友秋商量，就按照火钳的式样做起来。
    两个人苦战一通宵，就按照三个指头夹秧的式样，利用火钳启闭的杠杆原理，做成第一个插秧夹。开始，一次能插四蔸秧，后来逐渐增加夹齿，一次能插二十多蔸秧。但是因为秧夹开始是用木片做的，容易磨损，有时夹不住秧，还会漏秧。贺继生的老父亲贺义芳这时提了一个好建议。他说：“竹片炒过后，耐磨耐用抵得上钢铁，过去做推子齿都用这东西。最好换上竹片做夹齿”。他的建议被采纳了。秧夹是由夹齿和左右手柄两部分组成的，它等于人工插秧时的一只右手，是简易插秧机的主要组成部分。秧夹试制成功，插秧机就成功一大半了。	  还需要一只“左手”
    但是秧夹还是只能代替一只右手，而人工插秧时，是右手插秧，左手拿秧和协助分秧，两只手配合动作才能进行插秧的。于是，问题就转到如何给插秧机添一只左手。
    他们用灰船盛着秧苗，用秧夹夹着秧去插，灰船能装秧，但不能分秧，也不能送秧。因此，夹的时候，不能整整齐齐地夹住秧的基部，插不正，有时夹多夹少，还有漏蔸现象。
    贺继生又开始为突破最后一道难关苦思。一天，他在车水，发现龙骨车叶子转动得很有规律。他想，如果把灰船改装成秧箱，按照车叶子形式，安上一个压秧板把秧苗慢慢地送到秧夹引导板上，不是送秧、分秧的问题都解决了？这只灵巧的秧箱不就能给插秧机添一只左手么？他想着想着，忘记自己是在车水了，跳下水车，一口气跑到张友秋家里，两个人拿起锯、刨子就动手做起来。
    问题又来了。龙骨车叶子是脚踏着转动的，压秧板要它慢慢移动，靠什么带动呢？他们两个人商量，要是在秧箱两头能安两根有弹性的皮带带动一下就好了。贺继生连忙跑到家里，把自己的一双胶鞋拿来，剪成皮带安上。试验效果很好，压秧箱推着秧苗慢慢送到向下斜的秧夹引导板上，一个人操作着秧夹，张开夹齿，沿着引导板的斜度放下去，正好夹住秧苗的基部，把秧苗端端正正地插到田里。
    插秧机的两个主要组成部分——秧夹、秧箱做成了。也就是说，插秧机左右手都有了，夹秧、分秧的问题都解决了。后来，他们根据群众的建议，又做了一个秧箱架，把以上这两个主要组成部分联成一体。秧箱架下面安上一个船形的拖泥板，在水田中滑动着插秧。
    这样，从去年3月间起，贺继生和木工张友秋经过四个多月的刻苦钻研，终于试制成第一部插秧机。初步解决了在水稻田实现机械化的一个难题。
    现在，贺继生创造的插秧机，不仅在湖南省开始推广，而且全国有些水稻地区也开始采用了。
