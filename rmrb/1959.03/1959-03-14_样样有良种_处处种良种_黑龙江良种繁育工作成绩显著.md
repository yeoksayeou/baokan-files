    Good Varieties in Everything, Good Varieties Everywhere
    Remarkable Achievements in Seed Breeding in Heilongjiang
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 13th dispatch) This year in Heilongjiang Province, 90 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 96.7% of the province's total planned planting area this year, will be sown with superior seeds; and from grains, oilseeds, and sugar beets to hemp and vegetables, there are good varieties for everything. These seeds are now fully prepared.
    Heilongjiang Province has paid attention to seed work for many years. Especially during the Great Leap Forward last year, it established a complete system for breeding and promoting improved varieties, and conscientiously implemented the breeding policy of "combining scientific research with mass selection."
    After the realization of people's communes last year, the work of breeding good varieties was further promoted. Among the 526 people's communes in 47 counties, 433 people's communes in 43 counties have established fixed good seed breeding farms. The good seed breeding farms of the people's communes are closely linked with the national good seed breeding farms and scientific research departments, forming a province-wide network for breeding and promoting good varieties.
    Before the autumn harvest last year, the province's rural areas carried out the evaluation of good varieties, evaluating the good varieties promoted to farmers for breeding by scientific research institutes, experimental stations, and good seed farms. In 160 communes in 18 counties such as Mulan and Shuangcheng alone, 260,000 people participated in the evaluation of good varieties. In addition, various places also held selection and seed retention movement weeks (ten-day periods), retaining the best and eliminating the inferior for good varieties that have been promoted for many years, eliminating seed spikes with signs of degeneration, so that the good varieties maintain standardization.
    The great leap forward in seed work in Heilongjiang Province last year not only prepared enough good seeds for the province but also strongly supported fraternal provinces. After autumn last year alone, a total of more than 230 million jin of superior varieties were provided to other places.

### 样样有良种　处处种良种  黑龙江良种繁育工作成绩显著

    样样有良种　处处种良种
    黑龙江良种繁育工作成绩显著
    本报哈尔滨13日电　黑龙江省今年将有九千万亩、即占全省今年计划总播种面积96.7％的耕地，种上优良种子；而且从粮食、油料、甜菜到麻、蔬菜等作物，样样都有良种。这些种子现在已经备齐。
    黑龙江省多年来就注意种子工作，特别是去年大跃进中，建立了完整的良种繁育推广系统，认真贯彻了“科学研究和群众选育相结合”的育种方针。
    去年实现人民公社化以后，进一步推动了良种繁育工作。在四十七个县五百二十六个人民公社中，已有四十三个县四百三十三个人民公社建立了固定的良种繁殖场。人民公社的良种繁殖场，和国家良种繁殖场、科学研究部门紧密挂钩，全省就形成了一个良种繁育推广网。
    去年秋收前，全省农村开展了良种鉴评工作，鉴评科学研究所、试验站、良种场推广给农民繁殖的良种。单是木兰、双城等十八个县一百六十个公社，就有二十六万人参加良种鉴评工作。此外，各地还举行选种、留种运动周（旬），对已经推广多年的良种存精去劣，淘汰带有退化现象的种穗，使良种保持标准化。
    黑龙江省去年种子工作大跃进，不仅给本省准备了足够的良种，而且大力支援了兄弟省份。仅去年秋后，支援外地的优良品种一共有二亿三千多万斤。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（马新仁）
