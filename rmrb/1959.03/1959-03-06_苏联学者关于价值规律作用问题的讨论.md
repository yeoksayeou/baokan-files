Like the issue of commodity production, Soviet scholars are also engaged in heated discussions regarding the role of the law of value under the socialist system. The central issues under discussion are the following three: Does the law of value play a regulatory role in production? Does the law of value have an impact on production? The scope and form of the law of value's operation.

Regarding the first question, some scholars believe that the law of value, as a regulator of prices, inevitably plays a certain regulatory role in the development of production, and denying this is tantamount to denying the law of value. Some scholars even believe that the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy is a substitute for the law of value, a "deformation of the law of value" under the conditions of a developed socialist economy. That is to say, under socialist conditions, the law of value still maintains its original role, but it must be realized through the role of the law of planned development. This view has been criticized by many economists as a view that cancels the law of planned development of the national economy under the socialist system.

Regarding the second question, many people believe that it has an effect on the production of both means of production and consumer goods, although the effects are different. Only a few scholars believe that the law of value does not play a role within state-owned enterprises, because their production can be carried out through direct labor calculation without the aid of value forms. However, this view is considered inconsistent with the current economic practice in the Soviet Union.

The third question is the most controversial, first involving the role of the law of value in circulation, that is, the issue of its effect on prices. The vast majority of scholars believe that the law of value regulates prices, although this role is limited by the law of planned development. Some also believe that especially now, after the reorganization of tractor stations, the commodity form of the means of production must be used, which inevitably requires influencing the production and demand of the means of production through prices. Many scholars argue that the law of value regulates the prices of consumer goods, and the relationship between supply and demand plays a major role in the formation of consumer goods prices.

    苏联学者关于价值规律作用问题的讨论
    和商品生产问题一样，关于价值规律在社会主义制度下的作用问题，苏联学者也进行着热烈的讨论。探讨的中心问题有下面三个：价值规律对生产是否起调节作用；价值规律对生产是否起影响作用；价值规律作用的范围和形式。
    关于第一个问题，个别学者认为，价值规律作为价格的调节者，必然对生产发展起一定的调节作用，否认这一点就无异于否认价值规律。有个别学者还认为国民经济有计划按比例的发展规律是价值规律的代替者，是在发达的社会主义经济条件下的“价值规律的变形”，这就是说，在社会主义条件下，价值规律仍保持它原有的作用，只不过要通过有计划发展规律的作用而实现。这个观点受到许多经济学者的批评，认为是取消社会主义制度下国民经济有计划发展规律的观点。
    关于第二个问题，许多人认为无论对生产资料或消费资料的生产都发生作用，虽然作用有所不同。只有个别学者认为价值规律在国营经济内部不起作用，因为它们的生产可以不借助价值形式而进行直接的劳动计算。但这种观点被认为不符合苏联当前的经济实践。
    关于第三个问题争论最多，首先是涉及了价值规律在流通中的作用，也就是对价格的作用问题。绝大多数学者认为价值规律对价格起调节作用，虽然这种作用受到有计划发展规律的限制。有人还认为特别是现在拖拉机站改组后，要利用生产资料的商品形式，就必然要以通过价格影响生产资料的生产和需求为前提。许多学者主张，价值规律对消费品的价格有调节作用，供求关系在消费品的价格形成中起着主要的作用。
