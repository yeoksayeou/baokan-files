Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. Romanian state farms will achieve great development in agriculture and livestock and poultry breeding this year.

It is estimated that this year, state farms will deliver 70,000 tons more wheat and 300,000 tons more sugar beets to the state than in 1958. They will also produce 300,000 tons more corn. In addition, state farms will supply 98 million liters of milk, 800,000 pigs, and 1.1 million poultry this year.

Currently, the number of state farms has increased from 487 in 1958 to 500, and the cultivated land area will be increased to 1.1 million hectares through land reclamation, drainage, and other methods. This year, 1,600 tractors and 700 combine harvesters will be added.

At present, the cultivation and harvesting work of most state farms in Romania has been fully mechanized. This year, state farms will take advantage of this favorable condition to sow large quantities of hybrid corn, wheat, sugar beets, and sunflowers.

    新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚国营农场的农业和家畜家禽饲养业今年将获得很大发展。
    预计，今年国营农场将比1958年多交给国家七万吨小麦和三十万吨甜菜，多生产三十万吨玉蜀黍，此外，国营农场今年还将供应九千八百万公升牛奶，八十万口猪，一百一十万只家禽。
    目前，国营农场的数目已由1958年的四百八十七个增加到五百个，耕地面积将依靠开荒、排涝等方法增加到一百一十万公顷。今年将增加一千六百台拖拉机和七百台联合收割机。
    现在，罗马尼亚的大多数国营农场的耕种和收获工作已经完全机械化。今年，国营农场将利用这一有利条件大量播种杂交玉蜀黍、小麦、甜菜和向日葵。
