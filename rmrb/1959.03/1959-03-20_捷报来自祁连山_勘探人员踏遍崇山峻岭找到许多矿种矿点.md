Good News from the Qilian Mountains
Exploration Teams Traverse Mountains and Ridges to Find Many Mineral Types and Deposits

(By our reporter) On the snow-capped Qilian Mountains, industrial vanguards – geological exploration personnel – have sounded the battle drum to fight a great battle in the Qilian Mountains. Prospecting and drilling are advancing simultaneously, non-stop throughout the four seasons, determined to make the abundant underground treasures serve socialist construction more and faster.

The Qilian Mountains stretch for more than a thousand kilometers, surrounded by white clouds, and are rich in underground mineral resources, known as the "Urals of China." After liberation, the state immediately sent people to investigate. From 1954, the state sent geological teams of hundreds of people to conduct large-scale prospecting and mineral exploration. Geological workers, with the assistance of local people of all ethnic groups, traveled through high mountains and ridges, crossed rivers and streams, overcame frost, severe cold, rain, hail, and various difficulties in life, and found hundreds of mineral deposits.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, in order to accelerate the discovery of the rich resources of the Qilian Mountains, the broad masses of workers broke the conventions of drilling history and implemented winter drilling, carrying drilling rigs one by one to the mountains. They erected tents on snow-capped mountains more than 4,000 meters above sea level, keeping the drilling rigs running day and night. The vast geological prospecting personnel also persisted in winter prospecting work.

In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, geological exploration work has achieved brilliant achievements. Within an area of only 32,000 square kilometers, twenty-eight mineral types and one hundred and forty-one mineral deposits have been found, of which three mineral deposits have extremely high industrial value, and some have already submitted reserve data. According to rock analysis, it has been preliminarily determined that there are nine mineral belts in the Qilian Mountains, proving that the Qilian Mountains are indeed a treasure mountain of the motherland.

In order to achieve greater achievements this year, the staff of the Qilian Mountain Geological Team are determined to accelerate the progress of exploration, to find 300 mineral deposits, and to increase the total reserves by one time compared to the national plan. (Attached picture)

### 捷报来自祁连山  勘探人员踏遍崇山峻岭找到许多矿种矿点

    捷报来自祁连山
    勘探人员踏遍崇山峻岭找到许多矿种矿点
    本报讯  在终年冰雪复盖的祁连山头，工业尖兵——地质勘探人员擂起了大战祁连山的战鼓，普查、钻探齐头并进，四季不停，决心让地下丰富的宝藏更多更快地为社会主义建设服务。
    祁连山连绵一千多公里，白云环绕，地下矿产丰富多采，向有“中国的乌拉尔”之称。解放以后，国家立即派人前往勘察，从1954年起，国家更派来了数百人的地质队伍，进行大规模的普查找矿。地质工作人员在当地各族人民的协助下，走遍了高山峻岭、涉过河流涧溪，克服了风霜严寒、雨淋雹袭和生活上的种种困难，找到了数以百计的矿点。
    1958年大跃进以来，为了加速探明祁连山的丰富资源，广大职工们打破了钻探史上的惯例，实行了冬季钻探，把钻机一架架抬上山头，在海拔四千多公尺的雪山上，搭起帐篷，让钻机昼夜不停。广大的地质普查人员，也坚持着冬季普查工作。
    几年来，特别是去年大跃进以来，地质勘探工作已经取得了辉煌的成就，仅在三万二千平方公里的区域内，就找到了二十八个矿种、一百四十一个矿点，其中有三个矿点具有极大的工业价值，有的并已交出储量资料。根据岩石分析，初步断定祁连山有九条矿带，证明祁连山确实是祖国的一座宝山。
    祁连山地质队的职工们为了在今年内取得更大的成就，决心加速勘探的进度，要找到矿点三百个，总储量要比国家的计划增加一倍。（附图片）
