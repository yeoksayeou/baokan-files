Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—The Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a comprehensive survey work conference in late February to summarize the achievements of survey work over the past few years, exchange experiences, further clarify the direction and tasks of survey work, and discuss and study the development direction and work tasks of various survey teams this year.

Comprehensive survey work involves investigating and studying China's natural conditions and natural resources, collecting scientific data, proposing comprehensive development and utilization plans, and further providing suggestions for the allocation of productive forces, serving as a reference and scientific basis for the state to formulate long-term economic construction plans. Since the founding of New China, under the attention and support of the Party and the government, which provided all necessary conditions and assistance, the comprehensive survey work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has undergone tremendous development. To understand the planting and development of tropical resource plants, surveys of Hainan Island, the Leizhou Peninsula, and western Guangxi began in 1953. In recent years, due to the needs of national economic construction development, the comprehensive survey teams of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have gradually developed from scratch to the current nine (in addition, the Yellow River Midstream Soil and Water Conservation Comprehensive Survey Team concluded its work in 1958). The scope of the survey covers almost the entire country. In particular, in the past three years, the comprehensive survey work has involved vast areas, numerous disciplines, and the number of participants each year has been in the thousands, resulting in multifaceted achievements.

The conference believes that the achievements of the comprehensive survey over the past few years are primarily the preliminary investigation of the natural conditions and natural resources of the survey areas. For example, in the past three years, the Heilongjiang Team has not only ascertained the flow of the upper and middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River in its survey of the water energy and water conservancy resources of the Heilongjiang River Basin, but also conducted relatively detailed surveys of the dam site, geology, hydrology, and kinetic energy for cascade development in the upper and middle reaches, and also drilled at the dam site that may be used as the first phase of the project and selected the dam site line; it also gained an understanding of the geological mineral deposits, forests, soil, plants, fishery, and transportation conditions in the relevant areas. Therefore, after the completion of the field work, this team may be able to propose a comprehensive and comprehensive development plan for the Heilongjiang River Basin. The preliminary materials obtained by the Qaidam Salt Lake Team in its survey of the Qaidam Basin indicate that the basin is not only rich in salt reserves, but also in other minerals needed for industrial and agricultural production. The Yunnan Team has identified more than 200 kinds of resource plants in the Xishuangbanna area, including aromatic oils, oilseeds, tannins, fibers, and medicinal plants, and has also found that this area is suitable for the cultivation of tropical cash crops such as rubber and coffee. Secondly, through comprehensive surveys, a large amount of scientific data has been accumulated and charts have been drawn; tens of thousands of specimens of animals, plants, and soil have been collected, and many new or rare species have been discovered. These data have enriched and improved the research content of various related disciplines and provided favorable conditions for dividing the national natural zoning. At the same time, through surveys, new discoveries have been made about the natural conditions of some areas, and new clues and ways to understand natural laws have been obtained. For example, the discovery of a large amount of potash salt deposits in the Qaidam Salt Lake negated the past general view that inland lakes would not have potash salt deposits, thereby opening up a way for China to find potash fertilizer. Third, after clarifying and mastering the resource situation of a region, the survey team put forward suggestions for the development and utilization of these resources, which played a certain role in practical work. For example, the long-term planning opinions on the proportion of cotton and grain development in the Manas River area of northern Xinjiang, put forward by the Xinjiang Team after three years of investigation, have been adopted by the local production departments. The suggestions for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and water conservancy in the Turpan area of ​​southern Xinjiang have also attracted the attention of the local government. In addition, during the survey process, the teams also trained a group of young scientific workers, enriching the Academy of Sciences and local scientific research institutions. For example, in several years of soil survey practice, the Soil Team trained hundreds of key personnel and helped various localities and industrial sectors train 700 soil work cadres. The Xinjiang Team helped the Xinjiang Autonomous Region train 44 local and ethnic scientific work cadres and trained some scientific and technical personnel for various localities.

The meeting pointed out that the above-mentioned achievements were obtained due to the attention and support of the Party and government at all levels, the enthusiastic support and extensive cooperation of relevant units, and the political leadership and energetic efforts of the participants in the survey, and it is also inseparable from the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union in science and technology. The meeting believes that in the future, comprehensive survey work should gradually establish a part of full-time teams. On the other hand, due to the large scope and many disciplines involved in this work, it still requires the joint efforts of various research units, industrial sectors, and universities. Therefore, the meeting requested that all relevant units continue to strengthen cooperation, closely rely on the leadership of local Party committees, strengthen the Party leadership of various survey teams, give full play to the energy of scientists and all staff, continue to earnestly study the Soviet Union's scientific research achievements and experience, so as to continuously improve the level of China's comprehensive survey work and better complete the tasks assigned to the comprehensive survey personnel by the state.

Participants in this meeting included the leaders and representatives of ten teams, including the Yellow River Midstream Soil and Water Conservation Comprehensive Survey Team, the Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team, the Xinjiang Comprehensive Survey Team, the Qinghai-Gansu Comprehensive Survey Team, the Yunnan and South China Tropical Biological Resources Comprehensive Survey Teams, the Soil Survey Team, the Qaidam Salt Lake Survey Team, the Desertification Control Team, and the Western Region South-to-North Water Diversion Comprehensive Survey Team.

    为祖国经济建设普遍派出“侦察兵”
    中国科学院综合考察工作会议确定今后工作任务
    新华社3日讯　中国科学院在2月下旬召开了综合考察工作会议，总结几年来的考察工作成绩、交流经验，进一步明确考察工作的方向和任务，并对各考察队的发展方向和今年的工作任务进行了讨论和研究。
    综合考察工作是对我国的自然条件和自然资源进行调查和研究，收集科学资料，提出综合开发利用方案，并进一步对生产力配置提出建议，作为国家编制经济建设远景规划的参考和科学依据。新中国建立以来，中国科学院的综合考察工作，在党和政府的重视并给予一切必要的条件和支援下，有了巨大的发展，为了解热带资源植物的种植和发展情况，1953年开始了海南岛、雷州半岛和广西西部的考察。几年来，由于国家经济建设发展需要，中国科学院的综合考察队已经由无到有的逐渐发展到目前的九个（另有黄河中游水土保持综合考察队已在1958年结束工作）。考察范围几乎遍及全国。特别是近三年来，综合考察工作涉及的地区辽阔，包括的学科繁多，参加工作的人数每年都是以千计，因而取得了多方面的成果。
    会议认为：几年来的综合考察成绩，首先是初步调查了考察地区的自然条件和自然资源。如黑龙江队三年来在考察对黑龙江流域的水能、水利的资源中，不仅查明上中游的流量，对上中游梯级开发坝址、地质、水文、动能等都作了比较详细的勘察，而且钻探了可能作为第一期工程的坝址、选定了坝址线；对有关地区的地质矿藏、森林、土壤、植物、渔业等资源，以及交通运输情况也都进行了了解。因此，这个队在野外工作结束后，可能提出关于黑龙江流域的全面的综合开发远景方案。柴达木盐湖队在柴达木盆地进行调查所得初步材料，说明这个盆地不仅盐类储量丰富，而且富有其他工农业生产需要的矿藏。云南队在西双版纳区查明的资源植物有芳香油、油料、单宁、纤维、药用植物等二百多种，并查明这个地区适合栽培橡胶、咖啡等热带经济作物。其次，经过综合考察，积累了大批的科学资料并绘制了图表；收集了数以万计的动植物、土壤等标本，发现了许多新种或稀有种类，这些资料丰富和提高了各有关学科的研究内容，对划分全国自然区划也提供了有利条件。同时，通过考察，对有些地区的自然条件有新的发现，并且获得了新的了解自然规律的线索和途径。如在柴达木盐湖发现大量钾盐沉积，否定了过去一般认为内陆性湖泊不会有钾盐沉积的看法，从而开拓了我国寻找钾肥的途径。第三，考察队在查清和掌握一个地区的各种资源情况后，提出开发和利用这些资源的建议，对实际工作起了一定的作用。如新疆队经过三年考察后，对北疆玛纳斯河地区棉粮发展比重所提出的远景规划意见，已经为当地生产部门采纳。对南疆吐鲁番地区提出综合开发农、林、牧、水利的建议等，也都引起了当地政府的重视。此外，各队在考察过程中，还培养了一批青年科学工作者，充实了科学院和地方科学研究机构。如土壤队在几年的土壤测量实践中，培养了上百人的骨干队伍，并帮助各地和产业部门培养了七百个土壤工作干部。新疆队帮助新疆自治区培养了地方和民族科学工作干部四十四人，并为各地训练了一些科学技术人员。
    会议指出：上述成绩的获得，是由于各级党、政的重视和支持，有关单位的热心支援和广泛协作，以及参加考察工作人员政治挂帅、干劲充沛的结果，同时也和苏联在科学技术方面对我们给予无私的帮助分不开。会议认为：今后综合考察工作一方面应逐步建立一部分专职的队伍，另一方面，由于这项工作范围大、学科多，仍然需要各研究单位、产业部门、高等学校共同努力。因此，会议要求各有关单位继续加强协作，密切依靠地方党委领导，加强各考察队党的领导，充分发挥科学家和全体工作人员的干劲，继续认真学习苏联的科学研究成果和经验，以不断提高我国综合考察工作的水平，更好地完成国家对综合考察人员提出的任务。
    参加这次会议的有黄河中游水土保持综合考察队、黑龙江综合考察队、新疆综合考察队、青甘综合考察队、云南和华南热带生物资源两个综合考察队、土壤调查队、柴达木盐湖调查队、治沙队、西部地区南水北调综合考察队等十个队的负责人和代表。
