Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest — Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a report on the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at a meeting of party activists in Bucharest on the 6th.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a magnificent program for establishing the material and technical base of communism, and it marks the beginning of the transition to communism. The realization of this plan is a spiritual support for the people of all countries fighting for peace.

    Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the 21st CPSU Congress's thesis on the transition from socialism to communism has great significance not only for the Soviet Union but also for the entire international workers' movement. He said that the great achievements of the socialist camp countries once again prove the invincible strength of socialism.

    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the congratulatory messages delivered by representatives of communist and workers' parties from various countries at the 21st CPSU Congress demonstrated the unity of communist and workers' parties in various countries under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Life has proven the necessity of struggling against modern revisionism and dogmatism, and pointed out that modern revisionism is our main enemy at present. Fraternal parties from various countries resolutely condemned the modern revisionist ideas concentrated in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The counterattack against modern revisionism proves the maturity and unity of communist and workers' parties in various countries.

    Gheorghiu-Dej also spoke about the great achievements made by the Romanian people in socialist construction. He said that the Central Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party recently discussed the draft of a fifteen-year long-term plan for the development of the national economy. From 1960 to 1965, the transition to socialism will be completed, and a new stage will be entered—the stage of completing socialist construction. This draft will be discussed among the entire people and submitted to the Third Party Congress for adoption. He said that we believe that our people will devote all their efforts to building the material and technical foundation of socialism.

    Gheorghiu-Dej then spoke about Tito's speech after his visit to Asian and African countries, pointing out that Tito attempted to obscure people's understanding of the hypocritical policies of the Yugoslav leaders. Tito confused the policies of socialist countries with those of imperialist countries. Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that no one and no force can hinder the development of friendship between socialist countries and the people of Asian and African countries.

    乔治乌——德治报告苏共代表大会成就
    苏联七年计划开始了向共产主义的过渡
    新华社布加勒斯特讯　罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治6日在布加勒斯特党的积极分子会议上作了关于苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的报告。
    乔治乌—德治说，苏联七年计划是建立共产主义物质技术基础的宏伟纲领，它开始了向共产主义的过渡。这一计划的实现是对为和平而斗争的各国人民的一个精神上的支持。
    乔治乌—德治指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会关于由社会主义向共产主义过渡的论点，不仅对苏联，而且对整个国际工人运动都有巨大的意义。他说，社会主义阵营各国所获得的巨大成绩再一次证明了社会主义的不可战胜的力量。
    乔治乌—德治说，各国共产党和工人党的代表在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发表的祝词，显示了各国共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义旗帜下的团结一致。生活证明了对现代修正主义和教条主义作斗争的必要性，并且指明现代修正主义是我们当前的主要敌人。各国兄弟党坚决谴责了集中表现在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中的现代修正主义思想。对现代修正主义的反击证明了各国共产党和工人党的成熟和它们的团结一致。
    乔治乌—德治还谈到了罗马尼亚人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。他说，最近罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局讨论了发展国民经济的十五年远景计划草案。在1960年到1965年，将结束向社会主义的过渡，并进入一个新的阶段——完成社会主义建设的阶段。这个草案将在全民当中讨论，并提交党的第三次代表大会通过。他说，我们相信，我国人民将为建立社会主义的物质技术基础付出一切力量。
    乔治乌—德治接着谈到了铁托在亚非国家访问后所作的演讲，他指出，铁托企图使人们对南斯拉夫领导人的虚伪政策认识不清。铁托把社会主义国家的政策和帝国主义国家的政策混为一谈。乔治乌—德治强调说，没有任何人和任何力量能阻碍社会主义国家和亚非各国人民之间友谊的发展。
