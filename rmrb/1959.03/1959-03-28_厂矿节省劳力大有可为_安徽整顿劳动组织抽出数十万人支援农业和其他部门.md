Great Potential for Factories and Mines to Save Labor
Anhui Reorganizes Labor Organizations and Extracts Hundreds of Thousands of People to Support Agriculture and Other Departments

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) Anhui Province's industrial and transportation departments, in accordance with the decisions of the Provincial Party Congress, are mobilizing the masses and vigorously reorganizing labor organizations in conjunction with tool reforms and the technical revolution. Through this reorganization, the number of laborers in the industrial and transportation departments, which currently stands at more than 1.3 million, will be reduced to over 900,000. The hundreds of thousands of laborers extracted will be used to support agricultural production and other departments in need. In Huainan, Hefei, Bengbu and other places, after preliminary reorganization, arrangements have already been made for 240,000 people, of whom more than 196,000 have returned to the countryside. After preliminary reorganization, the industrial and transportation departments of Huainan City saved more than 40,000 people, and labor productivity increased by more than double that of the end of 1958.
    At present, local committees, municipal committees, and larger industrial and mining enterprises have established labor organization reorganization committees or offices, led personally by the secretaries. The provincial leading organs have also sent people to various places to conduct inspections and assist in the work. The methods of reorganization in various places are: reorganizing production organization, adjusting production layout, establishing responsibility and management systems, and overcoming the phenomenon of nobody being responsible, wasting time, and causing waste; implementing fixed personnel, quotas, and formulating various technical and economic indicators, and implementing economic accounting; mobilizing the masses to reform tools and improve labor efficiency.
    Last year, in enterprises and departments such as indigenous methods of iron smelting, steelmaking, coking, small coal mines, and places where industrial and mining enterprises and port terminals used backward tools for transportation, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has gradually increased and workers' skills have gradually become proficient due to tool reforms. This has prepared the ground for this year's reorganization of labor organizations and the saving of large amounts of labor. For example, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant's 20 small blast furnaces had more than 5,000 workers, management, and service personnel at the end of 1958, but after preliminary reorganization, this number has been reduced by 51.9%. In the Bengbu No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, the number of people required for a 13 cubic meter blast furnace was originally more than 100, but after reforming tools and improving labor organization, it was reduced to more than 30. The plant has implemented mechanization of ore crushing and coke crushing, and used blast furnace molten iron to cast indigenous iron rails, so that the plant's transportation vehicles are on rails, and blast furnace gas is used to boil water, cook food, and roast ore. Not only does this save a lot of manpower every month, but it also saves 7 tons of coal. In the first month, the entire plant initially streamlined 2,000 people, and iron production still exceeded the plan by 3%.
    In various places, in addition to a portion being used to support the needs of other departments, most of the labor force saved has been mobilized to return to the countryside to support agricultural spring production. Bengbu City proposed "Steel Commander takes command, gloriously returns home, industry and agriculture advance together, and a comprehensive leap forward is achieved." It carried out meticulous ideological education work for laid-off personnel and helped solve many specific problems, truly ensuring that "those who leave are happy and those who stay are at ease."

    厂矿节省劳力大有可为
    安徽整顿劳动组织抽出数十万人支援农业和其他部门
    本报讯　安徽省工业交通部门根据省党代表大会的决定，正发动群众，结合改革工具和技术革命运动，大力整顿劳动组织。通过这次整顿，工业交通部门一百三十多万名劳动力将减少到九十多万，被抽出的数十万劳动力将用来支援农业生产和其他部门需要。淮南、合肥、蚌埠等地经过初步整顿，已经作了安排的有二十四万人，其中已经回到农村的有十九万六千多人。淮南市工业交通部门经过初步整顿后就节约出四万多人，而劳动生产率比1958年底还提高一倍多。
    目前，各地委、市委和较大的工矿都成立了整顿劳动组织委员会或办公室，由书记亲自领导。省的领导机关也派人分赴各地进行检查，并帮助工作。各地整顿的方法是：整顿生产组织，调整生产布局，建立责任、管理制度，克服无人负责窝工浪费现象；实行定员、定额、制定各种技术经济指标，实行经济核算；发动群众改革工具，提高劳动效率。
    去年土法上马或土洋结合的炼铁、炼钢、炼焦、小煤窑等企业部门，和工矿企业、港口码头使用落后工具运输的地方，由于进行了工具改革，机械化半机械化的程度逐渐提高，工人技术逐渐熟练，因此为今年整顿劳动组织、节约大量劳动力准备了条件。如安徽省委钢铁厂二十座小高炉，1958年底有工人、管理和服务人员五千多人，现在初步整顿后就减少了51.9％。蚌埠第一钢铁厂，原来一座十三立方公尺高炉要一百多人，通过改革工具，改善劳动组织后，降到三十多人，厂内已实行了碎矿、碎焦机械化，用高炉铁水浇铸土铁轨，做到厂内运输车子轨道化，用高炉煤气烧水、做饭和焙烧矿石，每月不仅省了许多人力，还省煤七吨。第一个月内，全厂初步精简了二千人，铁的生产还超额3％完成计划。
    各地对节约出来的劳动力的安排，除一部分支援其他部门需要外，大部动员回农村支援农业春季大生产。蚌埠市提出“钢帅升帐，光荣回乡，工农并举，全面跃进”，对编余人员进行了细致的思想教育工作，并帮助解决了许多具体问题，确实做到“去者愉快，留者安心”。
