The Uproar Caused by Two Turbines
	Zhen Ya

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to build a dam power station at Greer's Ferry in Arkansas. To order two hydraulic turbines, the Corps of Engineers publicly tendered bids last fall. The well-informed "British Electric Company" in London also came to participate in the bidding. Although this British company needed to bear 12.5% ​​more import tax and 5% freight than the American company, its bid was only 1.45 million US dollars, which was 17% lower than the lowest bid of the American company Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. It stands to reason that the "British Electric Company" should be responsible for manufacturing these two hydraulic turbines. However, it didn't happen that way. Moreover, it also caused an uproar beyond business considerations.

In mid-January of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization resolutely rejected the bid of the "British Electric Company" and awarded the business to Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton.

The "mutually dependent" leader across the Atlantic also waved a big stick, saying that the reason why the United States rejected the "British Electric Company's" bid was because the business of these two turbines was related to the "national security interests" of the United States. It turns out that it is said that if this American company that manufactures "giant parts" does not get this contract, its machinery and equipment will be idle, and the "national security interests" of the United States require that the machinery and equipment of this company can operate normally.

The U.S. government has taken many protective measures for the benefit of domestic big bosses. In addition to high tariff barriers, import quotas and extremely complicated customs declaration procedures, there are also grand laws. For example, thirty-six years ago, during the Great Depression in the United States, the U.S. Congress passed a "Buy American Act." This law stipulates that when the federal government orders an item, under normal circumstances, if the price of a foreign company's product is no more than 6% to 10% lower than the price of a U.S. company, or no more than 12% in severely unemployed areas, then this law can be invoked to give priority to buying American goods and push foreign companies out of the door. Over the years, Washington has repeatedly used this legislation to repel the competition from its British partners. In 1955, when the U.S. federal government ordered turbines for the Joseph Dam, it invoked this magic weapon to block a British company whose bid was no more than 12% lower than that of an American company, causing a burst of curses in London. In 1957, when Washington ordered a batch of transformers, it also invoked this law that its British partners hated, once again giving a British company whose bid was 6% lower than that of an American company the cold shoulder. It just so happened that the British competitor did not give up. In the bidding for the Greer's Ferry Dam this time, the "British Electric Company's" bid was 17% lower than that of the American company, making it impossible to use the "Buy American Act." However, the devil is one foot tall, and the road is ten feet high. Washington has another trump card: "National Security Interests"!

The problem is that even a three-year-old child doesn't believe how two turbines could threaten the "national security" of the United States. No wonder the British Ambassador to the United States, Garcia, shouted in Washington in exasperation: "I don't think anyone can believe that if the two turbines are handed over to America's ally, Britain, to manufacture, it will threaten the security of the entire United States."

Indeed, London does not regard this bidding dispute over two turbines as a trivial matter. Not only did the British Ambassador to the United States successively visit Secretary of State Dulles in Washington on January 19 and 21 to file a protest from the British government, but also in London, British Trade Minister David Eccles did not hesitate to go to the U.S. Embassy in person to express the British government's "disappointment." On February 4, he further announced that because Washington unreasonably rejected the "British Electric Company's" bid, the new measures promised by Britain last September to further relax imports from the dollar area are now becoming more and more distant.

However, Washington took a cold and indifferent attitude towards this. Dulles only vaguely admitted in a conversation that there were "defects" in the handling procedures, and this "defect" was that the British company was not notified in advance that it did not need to bid. The giants of the American electrical industry, such as "General Electric Company," "Westinghouse Company," and "National Electrical Manufacturers Association," even more aggressively demanded that the government cite the precedents of restricting the import of lead, zinc, and oil to explicitly prohibit the import of foreign (including British) electrical machinery.

However, some American newspapers and even some congressmen seem to disagree with their government's approach. For example, the "New York Times" believes that the U.S. government's approach will "harm both our friends and ourselves" in international trade affairs. "Newsweek" even accused this of being "a brutal disposal." Some American congressmen even clamored to investigate this unreasonable incident of discrimination against British companies. They self-proclaimed to be "looking at the big picture," but in fact they were looking at more selfish and sinister goals. "Newsweek" inadvertently revealed the bottom line. This weekly said: What makes the British particularly sad is that just when the "U.S. Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization" rejected the bid of the "British Electric Company," the British Treasury Department approved the (American) "Reynolds Metals Company" to occupy the "British Aluminum Company" by buying up all the shares. The facts are more than that. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton, the American company that won the contract for these two turbines, had obtained more than 20 million US dollars in machine orders from the British Coal Board.

Even more shocking is the fact that when the United States is trying its best to crack down on British competitors, how much investment does the United States have in Britain? Half of the 3.9 billion US dollars of direct investment in Europe is invested in Britain. Today, there are still more than 250 American subsidiaries that have set up factories in the UK, penetrating all sectors of UK processing and manufacturing, petroleum, mining and smelting to public utilities and trade. The products of these American subsidiaries have already flooded the British market. Three-fifths of British household kettles, more than half of refrigerators, and a large number of medicines, beverages, automobiles and auto parts come from these companies. Among the new products exported by Britain after the 1930s, the products manufactured by American subsidiaries accounted for one-third of them! If automobiles are included, it will account for two-fifths.

This is the entire secret of why some American congressmen and newspapers such as the "New York Times" "look at the big picture." It turns out that what they are worried about is that if the Washington authorities do not even give British bosses a bite of two turbines, then what if this affects the American bosses' big feast in Britain? Wouldn't it be penny wise and pound foolish? This is why Washington is always more enthusiastic than London in singing beautiful tunes such as "Anglo-American alliance," "mutual dependence," and "free trade and cooperation."

    两部涡轮机引起的轩然大波
    振亚
    在美国阿肯色州的葛利尔渡口上，美国陆军工兵团打算建立一个水坝发电站。为了订置两部水力涡轮机，这个工兵团在去年秋天公开进行了招标。伦敦消息灵通的“英国电气公司”也赶来参加了投标。虽然这家英国公司需要比美国公司多担负12.5％的机件入口税和5％的运费，但是它的标价却只有一百四十五万美元，比美国一家标价最低的公司鲍德温—利马—汉密尔顿公司的喊价还低17％。照理，应是“英国电气公司”承制这两部水力涡轮机了。但是，并不如此。而且，还引起了一场超乎生意经以外的轩然大波。
    美国国防部和民防动员署于今年1月中旬，断然拒绝了“英国电气公司”的投标，把这笔生意交给了鲍德温—利马—汉密尔顿公司。
    大西洋彼岸的“相互依靠”的盟主，还挥来了一顶大帽子，说美国所以拒绝“英国电气公司”的投标，是因为这两部涡轮机的生意，关系到美国的“国家安全利益”。原来，据说这家制造“巨型机件”的美国公司要是得不到这笔合同，它的机器设备就会空闲下来，而美国的“国家安全利益”要求这家公司的机器设备能正常运转。
    美国政府为了国内大老板的利益，不知采取了多少保护措施。除了高关税壁垒、进口限额制和极为复杂的报关手续以外，还有堂皇的法令。譬如三十六年前，在美国经济大危机时期，美国国会就曾通过一个“购买美国货法”。这个法令规定，联邦政府在订购某项物品时，在通常情况下如果外国公司产品的价格低于美国公司价格的程度不超过6％到10％，或者在严重失业地区不超过12％，那就可以引用这条法令来优先买美国货，而把外国公司排挤于大门之外。这些年来华盛顿一再用这条立法打退了它的英国伙伴的竞争。1955年美国联邦政府在为约瑟夫水坝订购涡轮机的那次招标中，就曾祭起这个法宝，把一家喊价低于美国公司不超过12％的英国公司给挡了回去，引起了伦敦的一阵咒骂。1957年华盛顿在订购一批变压器时，同样引用了这条使它的英国伙伴切齿痛恨的法令，又一次对喊价较美国公司低6％的一家英国公司享以闭门羹。偏偏是英国竞争者并不泄气，在这次葛利尔渡口水坝的投标上，“英国电气公司”的标价比美国公司低17％，使“购买美国货法”无法使用。可是，道高一尺，魔高一丈，华盛顿还有一张王牌：“国家安全利益”！
    问题是，三尺孩童也不相信，怎么两部涡轮机竟会威胁了美国的“国家安全”。难怪英国驻美大使加西亚气急败坏地在华盛顿大声叫喊：“我觉得任何人都很难相信，如果把两只涡轮机交给美国的盟友英国去制造，就会使美国整个国家的安全受到威胁”。
    的确，伦敦对这场两部涡轮机的投标纠纷，并不看作是小事。不仅英国驻美大使于1月19、21两日在华盛顿接连访晤国务卿杜勒斯，提出英国政府的抗议，而且在伦敦英国贸易大臣戴维·埃克尔斯还不惜亲自到美国大使馆，表示了英国政府的“失望”。2月4日，他进一步宣布：由于华盛顿无理拒绝了“英国电气公司”的投标，英国在去年9月答应进一步放宽美元区进口的新措施现在又变得遥遥无期了。
    可是，华盛顿对此却抱着冷漠置之的态度。杜勒斯在一次谈话中仅淡淡地承认这只是处理手续上有“缺点”，而这个“缺点”却是事先没有通知英国公司不必投标。美国的电业工业界的巨头们像“美国通用电气公司”、“威斯汀豪斯公司”、“全国电气制造商协会”更是咄咄逼人地要求政府援引限制铅、锌和石油进口的先例，明令禁止外国（包括英国）电气机械的入口。
    但也有一些美国报刊甚至一部分议员，似乎颇不同意他们的政府的做法。如“纽约时报”认为美国政府的做法，将在国际贸易事务中“既损害我们的朋友，又损害自己”。“新闻周刊”甚至责备这是“一次凶狠的处置”。有的美国议员更叫嚷要查明这次歧视英国公司的无理事件。他们自我标榜是“从大处着眼”，实际上却是从更自私更阴险的目标着眼。“新闻周刊”就无意中泄了底，这家周刊说：特别使英国人难过的是：正当“美国民防动员署”拒绝了“英国电气公司”的投标的时候，英国财政部却批准了（美国）“雷诺兹金属公司”用收买全部股票的办法占有“英国制铝公司”。事实何止如此。这次夺取了两部涡轮机的承制权的美国鲍德温—利马—汉密尔顿公司，就曾从英国煤业局那里取得了二千多万美元的机器订货。
    更为惊人的事实是，当美国竭力打击英国竞争者的时候，美国在英国有多么大投资啊。美国在欧洲的三十九亿美元直接投资，其中有一半是投在英国的。今天，还有二百五十多家在英国设厂的美国子公司无孔不入地渗透到英国加工制造、石油、开采熔炼直到公用事业和贸易的各部门，这些美国子公司的产品在英国市场上已经是泛滥成灾。英国五分之三的家用水壶，一半以上的冰箱以及大量的药品、饮料、汽车和汽车配件都是来自这些公司。在三十年代后英国输出的新产品中，美国子公司所制的产品就要占其中的三分之一！如果把汽车计算在内，就要占去五分之二。
    这就是美国一些议员和“纽约时报”等报刊“从大处着眼”的全部奥秘所在。原来，他们所担心的是，如果华盛顿当局连两部涡轮机都不给英国老板吃一口的话，那末，万一因此影响到美国老板大吃英国的豪宴，岂非因小失大。华盛顿所以总是要比伦敦更加热衷于高唱“美英联盟”、“相互依靠”、“贸易自由和合作”之类的动听曲子，原因正是在这里。
