Inspecting Fields and Seedlings to Promote High Yields of Wheat
Jiangsu Province Convenes Meetings in Different Regions to Study Summer Field Management

Nanjing, March 8th (reported by this newspaper) – The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened meetings in late February in the Taihu, Lixiahe, and Xuhuai regions to inspect and promote large-scale high yields of summer crops, further mobilizing and organizing the entire party and people of Jiangsu to strive for victory in the first battle on the agricultural front this year. Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Liu Shunyuan and Hui Yuyu personally presided over these meetings held in the three regions.

Judging from the results of the inspections at the three regional meetings and the reports from various localities, there is great hope for large-scale high yields of wheat in Jiangsu Province this year, with even more favorable conditions than last year. The meetings pointed out that there are three prominent issues in summer crop production that should be brought to the attention of all localities: First, in some counties and communes, the sown area of wheat last autumn was significantly smaller than in previous years, and efforts must be made to increase the yield per unit area by multiples, even tenfold, to achieve the greater leap forward targets set by the state. The meetings believed that in implementing the principle of "high yield, less planting, more harvesting," it is necessary to combine principle and flexibility. Flexibility means adapting to local conditions, time, and people in implementing the policy. From the overall situation in the province, it is necessary to gradually and appropriately reduce planting on the basis of high yield and more harvesting. In areas with limited land and a large population, efforts should be made to achieve high yields per mu and harvest every fraction of land, rather than reducing planting. In areas with abundant land and a small population, communes can appropriately reduce planting, but this requires discussion by the masses and approval from higher levels. Second, the current characteristic of wheat growth in various regions is "large in the middle, small at both ends." "Large in the middle" means that wheat in most areas, in both large fields and basic fields, is growing well. "Small at both ends" refers to the fact that some wheat is growing too densely, while another portion is not growing well due to being planted too late. Various localities should take effective measures tailored to these three different situations. Complacency and relaxation of management are absolutely unacceptable for first and second-class seedlings. Third, prevent formalism and simplistic thinking. Now that communes are large in scope, county and commune cadres must frequently go deep down, inspect and discover problems, analyze problems, and solve problems. Problems should not be viewed simplistically. For example, dense planting is by no means the denser the better; deep plowing is not the deeper the better; fertilization is not the more the better. To strive for large-scale high yields of summer crops, all localities must analyze favorable conditions and unfavorable factors, develop favorable conditions, and overcome unfavorable factors.

The meetings believed that to ensure large-scale high yields of wheat, it is necessary to establish realistic and advanced targets. With advanced targets, it is possible to meet the aspirations and demands of the broad masses, mobilize the vast number of cadres and the masses, and fully utilize people's subjective initiative. After the Yangzhong County put forward the slogan of striving to become a "thousand-jin wheat county," it deeply resonated with the people, making cadres more conscientious, mobilizing the masses more widely, and making people's efforts more energetic and measures more solid. After the Suzhou Special Region put forward the battle cry of "Wheat catching up with rice again," the enthusiasm of the masses was even greater, the growth of summer crops was relatively balanced, and the manure accumulation movement was in full swing. The situation in other counties and cities is the same. The comrades who participated in the Xuhuai meeting also put forward the slogan "Work hard for one hundred and ten days, strive for a thousand jin of wheat, and strive for one season to equal one year," and decided to mobilize the masses to carry out the thousand-jin wheat movement in depth. Therefore, each county, commune, and brigade must set realistic and advanced targets, as well as advanced specific targets for different regions and different fields, including guaranteed high yield targets, striving for higher yield targets, and guaranteeing the elimination of targets below a certain level.

The meetings also pointed out that all localities should attach great importance to cultivating third-class seedlings. This year, in many regions, the number of third-class seedlings per mu is between 270,000 and 300,000. Although some of them are weak, the number of first-class seedlings per mu in the same period last year was only about 200,000. Therefore, as long as they are carefully cultivated, efforts should be made to harvest 700 to 800 jin, or even 1,000 jin, from the third-class seedlings. Summer crops should be classified and ranked, and managed in stages and phases, with field and seedling inspections to promote growth. All measures should meet the requirements of "more seedlings, stronger seedlings, hard stalks, more ears, bigger ears, and full grains."

The meetings also inspected and studied issues such as spring plowing preparations, rectification work, and the participation of leading cadres and grassroots cadres in labor under a system of responsibility.

### 看田看苗促进三麦高产  江苏省分片召开会议研究夏田管理工作

    看田看苗促进三麦高产
    江苏省分片召开会议研究夏田管理工作
    本报南京8日电　中共江苏省委在2月下旬先后在太湖、里下河和徐淮地区分三片召开会议，检查和促进夏熟作物的大面积高产，进一步动员和组织江苏全党全民力争今年农业战线上的首战胜利。省委第一书记江渭清、书记刘顺元、惠浴宇亲自主持了这在三片召开的会议。
    从三个区会议检查结果和各地汇报的情况来看，今年江苏全省三麦大面积高产是大有希望的，比之去年有更加有利的条件。会议指出，在夏熟生产上有三个突出问题，应该引起各地注意：一是有些县和公社去秋三麦播种面积比往年缩小较多，必须用极大力量来成倍成十倍的提高单位面积产量，才能实现国家所规定的更大跃进的指标。会议认为在贯彻“高产、少种、多收”的方针上，必须把原则性和灵活性结合起来，灵活性就是在贯彻方针上要因地、因时、因人制宜。从全省总的情况来说，要在高产多收的基础上逐步地适当少种。地少人多的地区，要力争亩亩高产，分分多收，而不能少种。地多人少的地区，公社可以适当少种一点，但需经过群众讨论和上一级批准。二是目前各地三麦生长的特点，是“中间大、两头小”。所谓“中间大”，就是大部分地区大田和基本田的麦子长得是好的。所谓“两头小”，一个是有小部分的麦子长得过密，另一头是有小部分麦子因种得太迟，长得不太好。各地应该根据上述三种不同情况，因地因时制宜地采取有效措施。对一、二类苗决不能麻痹自满，放松管理。三是防止形式主义和头脑简单。现在公社范围大，县社干部要经常深入下去，检查发现问题，分析问题，解决问题。看问题不能简单化。例如密植，绝不是越密越好；深翻，并不是越深越好；施肥，也不是越多越好。为了力争夏熟作物大面积高产，各地必须分析有利条件和不利因素，发扬有利条件，克服不利因素。
    会议认为，要保证三麦大面积高产，必须确定实事求是的先进指标。有了先进指标，才能符合广大群众的愿望和要求，才能对广大干部和群众起动员作用，才能充分发挥人的主观能动作用。扬中县提出的力争实现三麦千斤县的口号，深入人心以后，干部更加兢兢业业，群众动员的更广，人们的干劲更足，措施更扎实。苏州专区提出“三麦再赶水稻”的战斗口号以后，群众干劲更大，夏熟作物的生长比较平衡，积肥运动热火朝天。其他各县市的情况也是这样。参加徐淮会议的同志们还提出了“苦干百十天，大干三麦一千斤，力争一季顶一年”的口号，决定动员群众深入开展三麦千斤运动。因此，各县各公社各大队必须订出实事求是的先进的指标，和不同地区、不同田地的先进的具体指标，包括保证达到多少斤高的指标，力争达到多少斤高的指标，保证消灭多少斤以下的指标。
    会议还指出，各地要十分重视培育三类苗，今年很多地区的三类苗，每亩在二十七万苗到三十万苗之间，其中虽有些瘦弱的，但去年同期的一类苗每亩也只有二十万苗左右，因此只要精心培育，力争三类苗也收七八百斤，以至千斤。对夏熟作物要进行分类排队，分段分期管理，看苗看田促进。一切措施要达到“苗多、苗壮、秆子硬，穗多、穗大、粒饱满”的要求。
    会议对春耕准备、整社工作和领导干部基层干部分片包干参加劳动等问题，作了检查和研究。
