Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 28th: A large quantity of crude oil produced by the Yumen Oilfield is being transported eastward day and night to supply the Lanzhou and other oil refineries, accelerating the refining of various petroleum products. Oil tank cars filled with crude oil travel along the Lanxin Railway every day, like long dragons. According to comrades from the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau: From February to the 27th, the net crude oil transported out has increased by 32.3% compared with January, creating the highest record for eastward crude oil transportation from the Yumen Oilfield to date.

In order to accelerate the eastward transportation of crude oil, the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau and the railway department have jointly adopted a series of effective measures. The Administration Bureau has strengthened the organization and management of the complex oil transportation system from the oil wells to the station's oil depot, and after laying the oil pipeline from the Ya'erxia Oilfield to the station in January, it began laying the oil pipeline from the Baiyang River Oilfield to the station in February. This oil pipeline will be completed and put into operation within days. In order to ensure the rapid eastward transportation of crude oil, the Lanzhou Railway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has instructed the vehicles within its jurisdiction to be dispatched as a priority. The oil loading workers at the oil transportation station have been on duty day and night in the cold weather for a long time, ensuring that loading is done as soon as the trains arrive.

    玉门原油源源东运
    新华社玉门28日电  玉门油矿生产的大量原油正在日夜兼程东运，以供兰州等炼油厂加速炼制各种石油产品。装满原油的油槽车，每天沿着兰新铁路，像一条一条长龙一样。据玉门石油管理局有关同志说：2月份到27日止，已经运出的净原油比1月份增加32.3％，创造了迄今玉门油矿原油东运的最高纪录。
    为了加速原油东运，玉门石油管理局和铁道部门共同采取了一系列有效措施。管理局加强了产油井到车站油库之间的复杂的输油系统的组织管理，并且继1月份铺好鸭儿峡油田到车站的输油管之后，又在2月份着手铺设白杨河油田到车站的输油管，这条输油管日内即可完工输油。铁道部兰州铁路管理局为保证原油迅速东运，已指示所辖范围内的车辆尽先调用。运油车站的装油工人们，长时间以来在天寒地冻中日夜值班，作到了随到随装。
