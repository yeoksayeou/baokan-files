    Sending to Friends Far Away
    Wang Zhuyu
    Dear friends, here on the banks of the Ussuri River, where the wind is fierce and the clouds are cold, I send you a letter with the scent of spring.
    In the beautiful Jiangnan region, March is the season of dancing bees and butterflies, a riot of color; even along the Yellow River, the willow leaves are turning green and hundreds of flowers are budding. But in the northeast corner of our motherland—the Great Northern Wilderness—birds cannot fly in, and ice and snow cover the ground; the oak forests are still draped in silver, and the rivers and mountains are still dressed in winter clothes... Yet, even in this cold land, the air is thick with the scent of spring.
    We have been in the Great Northern Wilderness for a full year now. A year ago, the "Liberation" brand trucks of the Mishan Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau were like rushing rivers, carrying demobilized soldiers from the frontiers, islands, and forward tunnels.
    At that time, it was exceptionally cold, with heavy snow and temperatures of minus seventeen degrees Celsius. But we were greeted by the burning enthusiasm of the people of the Great Northern Wilderness. The reception stations along the way were crowded with men, women, old, and young, holding red flags, waving bouquets, beating gongs and drums, and setting off firecrackers. We felt as if we had returned to our long-lost hometown, eager to jump out of the car, embrace and shake hands with the welcoming crowds, and chat and laugh to our hearts' content. But the wheels of the cars were spinning rapidly, and the scene before us flashed by; the north wind led the way, snowflakes accompanied us, and the engine, accompanied by heroic songs, carried us further into the distance...
    A year ago today, our new life began. We, the new masters of the Great Northern Wilderness, quickly arranged our lives in a combat-ready manner: if the kitchen was not enough, we would dig a stove and cook; if it was cold, we would chop wood and heat the kang (a heated brick bed); if there was a shortage of houses, we would set up tents... The day after we arrived at the farm, we demanded to go to the fields to work before we had even brushed off the dust from our journey. The production team leader, an old farm director who had traversed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, tried to dissuade everyone with much effort, but failed. Many people ran to the riverbank and the hillside to collect manure and chop wood, to inspect our new hometown. What a wonderful place! Vast stretches of black earth, vast stretches of forest; crisscrossing rivers and streams, mountains rising into the clouds. A rich hometown, a rich Great Northern Wilderness!
    Now, we have been in the Great Northern Wilderness for a year. Over the past year, we have used the hands of soldiers, the hands that have held red flags, the hands that have fought with bayonets, the hands that have swung sledgehammers, the hands that have held hoes, the hands that are covered with calluses, to turn over the black earth in the vast wilderness, remove the armor of the Great Northern Wilderness, and grow golden grain; on the Wanda Mountains, in the towering virgin forests, we have felled three million cubic meters of timber; on the wastelands where wild beasts once roamed and thorns grew everywhere, we have built two railways that run across the reclamation area; in the face of wind and snow, in the extreme cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius, we have erected long rainbows on the plains and locked up the dragons—we have built more than a dozen large and small artificial lakes; on the edge of yesterday's trenches and bunkers, on the ruins destroyed by war, we have moved in the "Flaming Mountains" and made molten iron flow,... Ah, our hot sweat nourishes the Great Northern Wilderness, and we embroider dragons and phoenixes on the land! Comrades all say that we repair the earth, and the earth also "repairs" us: we repair the earth into a colorful landscape; the earth "repairs" us into healthy bodies and minds.
    Friends, all of this is a small note that we have contributed to the surging tide of our motherland's Great Leap Forward, in our communist chorus! And you, fighting on the sea frontiers, guarding the open-hearth furnaces, traversing the Gobi Desert, working in the high-yield fields, galloping on the Pamir Plateau, toiling on the Sanmenxia construction site... have greater victories, more good news, and higher triumphal songs than us, to report victory to the motherland and to pay tribute to Chairman Mao!
    The drums of the Great Leap Forward are urging the arrival of spring. This year, the spring in the Great Northern Wilderness seems to be coming early too. Although the weather is cold, people's hearts are already filled with the warmth of spring. Even at night, you can hear the songs by the steelmaking furnaces, and the rough voices of tractors, accompanied by the shrill cries of factory whistles, piercing the night sky of the prairie. Isn't this sound a prelude to welcome the spring?
    Spring has come to the Great Northern Wilderness, and life in the Great Northern Wilderness is truly rich and colorful! Our friends far away, if you could come and see the vigorous appearance of the Great Northern Wilderness, you would surely fall in love with it.

    寄给远方的朋友们
    王主玉
    亲爱的朋友，我在风厉云寒的乌苏里江畔，寄给你们一叶春天的信笺。
    阳春3月，在秀丽的江南，已是蜂蝶翩舞、万紫千红的季节了；就是黄河两岸，也是柳叶舒青、百花吐蕾的时候了。可是，在祖国东北的一角——北大荒，却是鸟飞不下，冰雪盖地；柞树林还披着银色的罩衫，江河群山还满身冬装……然而就在这寒冷的土地上，却充满了浓郁的春天的气息。
    我们来北大荒已整整一年了。一年前，密山铁道兵农垦局的解放牌卡车，正像奔流的长河，载着来自边陲、海岛和前沿坑道的转业官兵们。
    那时，正是异常寒冷的时候，大雪飘飘，气温在零下十七度。但迎向我们的，却是北大荒人火一样的热情。沿途欢迎我们的接待站，簇拥着男女老少，举着红旗，挥舞花束，敲锣打鼓，鞭炮齐鸣。我们仿佛回到了阔别的故乡，恨不得跳下车去，和欢迎的人群拥抱握手，纵情谈笑。但汽车的轮子在飞速地旋转，眼前的景象一闪而过；北风带路，雪花作伴，马达伴着豪迈的歌声，我们又奔向远方……。
    一年前的今天，我们新的生活开始了。我们这北大荒的新主人，以战斗的姿态，迅速地安排了生活：厨房不够，就埋锅造饭；天冷，去砍柴烧炕；房屋缺少，就支起帐篷……我们到农场的第二天，还没有掸去旅途的尘土，就要求下田劳动。生产队长、曾经走过雪山草地的老场长，费了许多唇舌，也没有劝住大家，不少人跑向河畔、山坡，去拾粪砍柴，去巡视我们这新的家乡。嗬，这是多好的地方呵！大片的黑土，大片的树林；河川纵横，山高入云。富饶的家乡，富饶的北大荒！
    现在，我们来北大荒一年了。一年来，我们用战士的手，用举过红旗的手，用拚过刺刀的手，用抡过铁锤的手，用拿过锄头的手，用结满老茧的手，在千里荒园上把黑土翻过来，揭去了北大荒的铠甲，种出了金色的粮食；在完达山上，在参天的原始森林里，采伐了三百万立方木材；在昨天野兽穿行、荆棘遍地的荒原上，修建了两条横贯垦区的铁路；在风天雪地的阻拦下，在零下三十度的奇寒里，平地上架起长虹，锁住蛟龙——我们修筑了大小十几个人工湖；在昨天的战壕边、碉堡旁，在被战争摧毁的废墟上，我们搬来了“火焰山”，烧得铁水奔流，……啊，我们的热汗滋润着北大荒，我们在大地上描龙绣凤！同志们都说，我们修理地球，地球也“修理”我们：我们把地球修理得斑烂多采；地球把我们“修理”得身心健康。
    朋友们，这一切，是我们在祖国跃进的激流里，在我们共产主义的合唱队里，献出的一个小小的音符！而你们，战斗在海疆，守卫在马丁炉旁，穿行在戈壁滩上，劳动在丰产田里，奔驰在帕米尔高原，忙碌在三门峡工地……比我们有更大的战绩，更多的喜报，更高的凯歌，向祖国报捷，向毛主席献礼！
    跃进的战鼓催促着春天的到临。今年北大荒的春天，也似乎来得早了。天气虽然寒冷，但在人们心里却早已是春暖花开了。就是在夜里，你也可以听见炼钢炉边的歌声，以及拖拉机粗犷的喉咙，伴着那工厂汽笛的尖叫，划破了草原的夜空。这声音不正是一支迎春曲调么？
    春天来到了北大荒，北大荒的生活真是丰富多采！我们远方的朋友，如果你们能够来看看北大荒的刚健风貌，你们一定会爱上北大荒的。
