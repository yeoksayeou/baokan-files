Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 7th. The fifteen large sugar factories in the South with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of over one thousand tons have launched a sugar production emulation drive to compete on vigor, output, quality, and cooperation. They are determined to work hard for forty-five days, finish crushing all sugar materials for this pressing season ahead of schedule in mid-April, and guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the year's production plan.

    The Zhongshan Sugar Factory in Guangdong Province, with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of two thousand tons, initiated this competition. From the pressing season that began in October of last year, due to close reliance on the local Party committee and full mobilization of the masses, they still over-fulfilled the state plan every month despite shortages in fuel, raw materials, and transport capacity. In their competition proposal to fellow sugar factories, in addition to guaranteeing a sugar output of 33,000 tons this year, exceeding the state plan by 13.62%, they also put forward seven competition conditions.

    After the Zhongshan Sugar Factory's proposal was issued, it immediately received a warm response from the representatives attending the sugar production reporting meeting in the six southern provinces and regions. Participating in the competition are: the ten sugar factories in Guangdong Province: Nanhai, Dongguan, Huiyang, Shitou, Shunde, Zini, Jieyang, Overseas Chinese, Jiangmen, and Yangjiang; the Guixian Sugar Factory and Guiping Sugar Factory in Guangxi; the Second Sugar Factory in Jiangxi; and the Xianyou Sugar Factory in Fujian. In addition to fully agreeing to the seven competition conditions put forward by the Zhongshan Sugar Factory, they also put forward new supplementary conditions based on their specific circumstances. And they have formulated specific measures to achieve the competition targets.

    南方六省区将提前完成上半年计划
    十五个大糖厂展开丰产大竞赛运动
    据新华社广州7日电　南方十五个日榨甘蔗千吨以上的大糖厂，掀起比干劲、比产量、比质量、比协作的糖业丰产大竞赛运动。他们决心苦战四十五天，提前在4月中旬榨完这个榨季的全部糖料，并且保证完成和超额完成今年全年生产计划。
    发起这次竞赛的是广东省日榨甘蔗两千吨的中山糖厂。这个厂从去年10月开始的榨季里，由于密切依靠当地党委，充分发动群众，因而在燃料、原材料、运力不足的情况下，仍然月月超额完成国家计划。他们在向兄弟糖厂发出的竞赛倡议书中，除了保证今年糖产量达到三万三千吨，超过国家计划13.62％以外，还提出了七个竞赛条件。
    中山糖厂的倡议书发出后，立刻得到了参加南方六省区糖业生产汇报会议的代表们的热烈响应。参加竞赛的有：广东省的南海、东莞、惠阳、市头、顺德、紫坭、揭阳、华侨、江门、阳江十个糖厂，广西的贵县糖厂、桂平糖厂，江西的第二糖厂和福建的仙游糖厂。他们除了全部同意中山糖厂提出的七个竞赛条件以外，还根据具体情况分别提出了新的补充条件。并且订出了实现竞赛指标的具体措施。
