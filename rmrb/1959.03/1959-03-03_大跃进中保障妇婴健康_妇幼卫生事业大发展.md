    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rural people's communes, maternal and child health services throughout the country have developed rapidly in the past year. The number of rural maternity hospitals across the country has reached more than 100,000, with approximately 400,000 beds, most of which were newly built after August of last year.

    The development of maternity hospitals has played an important role in promoting modern midwifery and ensuring the health of mothers and children. Modern midwifery has now been basically popularized in rural areas across the country. In August of last year, Gansu Province achieved the goal of having maternity hospitals in every township; by the end of September, modern midwifery had been basically popularized throughout the province. The establishment of maternity hospitals has created conditions for promoting prenatal checkups, greatly reducing difficult births. In Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, a woman had been pregnant twice in the past, but because she did not have prenatal checkups, the abnormal fetal position could not be corrected in time, so both births were transverse presentations, and the children died. Last year, the woman became pregnant again. Because a maternity hospital was established locally, she received prenatal checkups, corrected the fetal position, and gave birth to a healthy child. People's communes in various localities provide appropriate care for the lives of women during their stay in the hospital, giving priority to the distribution of refined grains and nutritious non-staple foods to mothers. Many maternity hospitals have formulated various regulations based on the development of production and the protection of maternal and infant health. For example, the Shixia Township in Xili County, Gansu Province, runs a sideline processing factory near the maternity hospital, including sewing and raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, bees, etc. Pregnant women can participate in light labor during their prenatal hospitalization, which is not only conducive to production but also promotes the popularization of modern midwifery and the implementation of women's labor protection policies. The Daye Town Maternity Hospital in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, stipulates that it will accept infant day care after the mother is discharged from the hospital, until the infant is five months old. During the infant's custody, the mother can be assigned by the production unit to participate in production labor near the maternity hospital, breastfeed the child at the maternity hospital on time during the day, and take the baby home at night.

    The large number of rural maternity hospitals that developed last year were built under the leadership of the Party committees and with the help of the communes. Commune members themselves adjusted and repaired houses for the maternity hospitals and lent some utensils to the maternity hospitals, implementing the spirit of diligence and thrift in running health undertakings.

    Urban maternity hospitals also developed last year on the basis of the original better conditions. Cities such as Guangzhou have basically popularized hospital births. Many city maternity hospitals and maternal and child health institutions have added simple delivery beds, giving more women the opportunity to give birth in hospitals.

    Another important aspect of maternal and child health services in the past year—nurseries and kindergartens—has also developed greatly. It is estimated that approximately 60% of preschool children in rural areas across the country are enrolled in nurseries. These nurseries and kindergartens have adopted flexible methods based on the principles of being conducive to production and convenient for the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, some temporary and simple childcare organizations in the past have been transformed into permanent childcare institutions.

    In the midst of intense production and construction, some areas have strengthened women's labor protection work, thereby reducing or preventing miscarriages and gynecological diseases, improving women's health, and increasing women's attendance rates. When Shanxi Province carried out this work, it first used various occasions and various forms to publicize the importance of women's labor protection and women's labor hygiene knowledge to the masses through living examples; at the same time, when arranging labor, it universally took into account the characteristics of women and implemented the practice of women not doing heavy work or going into cold water during menstruation; pregnant women doing light work; and breastfeeding women doing nearby work to facilitate breastfeeding. Sanjiadian and other places in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, also set up women's health rooms near the maternity hospitals to provide free sanitary napkins for women during menstruation. Some counties and cities have also set up women's health rooms in schools and factories. After Shanxi Province implemented various measures for women's labor protection, it reduced women's premature births, miscarriages, uterine prolapse, and excessive menstrual bleeding, and women's attendance rate has increased significantly compared with the past. Some places in Shandong Province have created a method of setting up temporary female toilets when working in the fields, allowing women to dare to drink more boiled water in the field, protecting women's health, and improving labor productivity. Although this is a simple measure, it solves an important problem in women's labor life.

### 大跃进中保障妇婴健康  妇幼卫生事业大发展

    大跃进中保障妇婴健康
    妇幼卫生事业大发展
    新华社2日讯　随着工农业生产的大跃进和农村人民公社化，一年来全国妇幼卫生事业有了很快的发展。全国农村产院已达到十万多所，床位约有四十多万张，其中大部分是去年8月以后新建的。
    产院的发展对于推广新法接生和保障妇幼健康起了重要的作用。现在全国农村中已基本上普及新法接生。甘肃省去年8月份达到了乡乡有产院；到9月底就在全省范围内基本上普及了新法接生。产院的建立，为推行孕期检查创造了条件，使难产大大减少。陕西省三原县有一个妇女过去怀过两胎，由于没有进行孕期检查，不正的胎位不能及早纠正，因此两胎都是横产，孩子都死了。去年这个妇女又怀了孕，由于当地设立了产院，她接受了孕期检查，纠正了胎位，顺利地生了一个孩子。各地人民公社对产妇住院期间的生活有适当照顾，把细粮和富有营养的副食品优先分配给产妇吃。许多产院都从发展生产和保护母婴健康出发制定了各种规章。例如甘肃省西礼县石峡乡在产院附近举办产院副业加工厂，包括缝纫和饲养鸡、鸭、兔、蜂等，孕妇可以在产前住院参加轻微劳动，既有利于生产，又促进了新法接生的普及和妇女劳动保护政策的贯彻。河南省登封县大冶镇产院规定在产妇出院后接受婴孩日托。一直托到婴儿满五个月。在婴孩寄托期间，母亲可以由生产单位分配在产院附近参加生产劳动，白天按时到产院给孩子喂奶，晚上把婴儿接回家去。
    去年发展的大批农村产院，都是在党委的领导和公社的帮助下兴建的。公社社员自己为产院调整和修建了房屋，并且借给产院一些用具，贯彻了勤俭办卫生事业的精神。
    城市产院在原来较好的基础上，去年也有了发展。广州等城市已基本上普及了产妇住院生产。好些城市的产院和妇幼保健机构都增设了简易产床，使更多的产妇得到了住院生产的机会。
    一年来，妇幼卫生事业的另一重要方面——托儿所和幼儿园也有很大发展。据估计，全国农村入托儿童约占学龄前儿童的60％左右。这些托儿所和幼儿园根据有利于生产和便利群众的原则，采取了灵活的方式。大跃进以来，过去一些临时的、简便的托儿组织都转变为常设的托儿机构。
    在紧张的生产建设中，有些地区加强了妇女劳动保护工作，因而减少或防止了流产以及妇科病的发生，增进了妇女的健康，提高了妇女出勤率。山西省在开展这项工作的时候，首先利用各种场合，采取各种形式，以活人活事向群众宣传妇女劳动保护的重要意义和妇女劳动卫生知识；同时，在安排劳动力的时候，普遍照顾到妇女的特点实行了妇女在月经期间不做重活，不下冷水；孕期妇女作轻活；哺乳期间的妇女作近处的活，便于给孩子喂乳。山西省晋城县三家店等地还在产院附近设置妇女卫生室，为经期妇女免费供给清洁的月经纸。有的县市在学校和工厂中也设置了妇女卫生室。山西省实行妇女劳动保护的各种措施以后，减少了妇女早产、流产、子宫脱垂和经期出血过多现象，妇女出勤率比过去有显著的提高。山东省有些地方创造了在田间劳动时设置临时女厕所的办法，使妇女在野外劳动中敢于多喝开水，保护妇女健康，提高了劳动力。虽然这是一项简单的措施，却解决了妇女劳动生活中的一个重要问题。
