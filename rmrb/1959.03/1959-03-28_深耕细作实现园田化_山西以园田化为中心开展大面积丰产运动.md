    Intensive Cultivation Realizes Garden Plot Management
    Shanxi Carries Out Large-Scale High-Yield Movement Centered on Garden Plot Management
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 27th) All parts of Shanxi Province are vigorously launching a large-scale high-yield movement centered on garden plot management in the current spring plowing production.
    At present, the movement to advance towards garden plot management has generally formed a climax in the province and has achieved great results. The leading departments of the Jin Southeast Special District held an on-site garden plot management meeting in Gaoping People's Commune, Jincheng County, to exchange experience measures for realizing garden plot management in mountainous areas such as "drawing water up the mountain, garden plot management to the slope." Now, the entire district is managing wheat fields according to the technical standards of garden plot management, and is adopting a method that combines large, medium, and small sizes, combines high and low standards, and simultaneously grasps plains and mountains to vigorously carry out the garden plot management construction movement for spring sowing arable land.
    The garden plot management movement in various places has driven the entire spring production. According to the characteristics of cotton and wheat producing areas, the Jin South Special District is currently carrying out a garden plot management irrigation movement. By the end of March, the entire district will have completed the ridge field irrigation of all the wheat fields in the watered areas; the cotton and autumn fields in the watered areas should plan roads, build canals, and level the land to lay a good water conservancy foundation for the realization of garden plot management. The entire district has advanced irrigation to ensure timely and appropriate water use for wheat and to ensure irrigation and moisture retention for cotton and autumn fields. The Jinzhong area has launched a "early irrigation, fast irrigation, more irrigation, good irrigation" spring irrigation competition with garden plot management as the guideline (60 cubic meters of water per mu), which has entered a climax. In the Fenhe River, Xiaohe River, and Wenyuhe River irrigation areas, more than 400,000 mu of land have been irrigated in the past month, which is more than one-third more than the same period last year. The Jinbei Special District, where low yields were transformed into high yields in last year's Great Leap Forward, has recently launched a high-yield and higher-yield movement, planning to initially realize garden plot management on 3.5 million mu of cultivated land this year on the basis of implementing the basic farmland system last year.
    According to the materials summarized by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction: at present, most of the large-area high-yield garden plot management cultivated land planned in various places has been deeply cultivated from one to three chi [Chinese feet]; according to statistics in mid-March, 3.88 million mu of basic farmland have initially reached the standard of garden plot management. All parts of the province are taking the method of combining professional teams with mass movements to organize a blitz battle, striving to have all the garden plot management cultivated land completed before spring sowing.
    The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee regards carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement centered on garden plot management as a major measure to realize the province's agricultural leap forward plan this year. According to the conditions of rural labor, fertilizer, water conservancy, etc., take the method of gradual realization from less to more, from low-level to high-level. This year, the province plans for an average of one mu of land per person to realize garden plot management, and 16 million mu of basic farmland in the province will initially realize garden plot management. The Provincial Party Committee also requires that garden plot management cultivated land should use more than 30 labor days per mu throughout the year, deep plowing from one to three chi, watering more than three times, and applying 30,000 to 50,000 jin of organic fertilizer per mu. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture should be fully implemented on garden plot management cultivated land, striving for a yield of 1,500 to 2,000 jin of grain per mu, 300 to 400 jin of cotton per mu, and 800 to 1,000 jin of oil crops per mu, so that this part of garden plot management cultivated land will become a base for increasing the province's grain, cotton, and oil crop production. At the same time, according to the principle of guaranteeing the key points and taking care of the general, implement large-area high-yield garden plot management cultivated land and general cultivated land simultaneously, ensuring that general cultivated land conscientiously implements production increase measures and realizes an all-round bumper harvest.
    The standards and measures for initial realization of garden plot management proposed by various places have their own focuses according to local conditions, roughly in nine aspects: First, the foundation of garden plot management is water conservancy, which should be done so that water is available whenever it is needed, so that cultivated land becomes "guaranteed harvest without rain, and not affected by floods with more rain," and at the same time, ditch the furrows and divide the ridge fields. Second, the cultivated land should be repaired to be "as smooth as a mirror, as fine as flour, and the ridges are like lines," which is convenient for water conservation, soil conservation, and fertilizer conservation. Third, deeply turn the soil, apply a large amount of fertilizer, and apply fertilizer reasonably. Apply base fertilizer in layers for autumn plowing land, apply fertilizer with planting during sowing, and apply topdressing fertilizer separately during the crop's jointing, booting, flowering, and grain filling periods. Fourth, plan the cultivation area to regionalize crops, and distribute crops according to soil, climate, and other conditions to achieve comprehensive high yields. Fifth, reasonably densely plant according to crops, varieties, and soil. After the seedlings emerge, check and replant more to achieve full and strong seedlings. Sixth, all grains, cotton, oil crops, and vegetables use excellent varieties. Seventh, promote intercropping, interplanting, and multiple cropping to achieve multiple crops in one year. Eighth, no grass in the fields, eliminate pests and diseases. Ninth, in field management, the method of processing in stages and by crops should be implemented.
    In order to make garden plot management smoothly, party and government organizations at all levels have taken a series of corresponding measures. In addition to exchanging the experience of E'kou Township, Dai County, Jinbei, where the average grain yield per mu of experimental garden plot management was doubled to 600 jin last year, a group of cadres and farmer representatives were also organized to visit and learn from other places. Jincheng and other counties carried out a large-scale teaching and training of garden plot management technology, first engaged in a part of "demonstration fields," organized cadres and farmers to visit, learned if they didn't know how, and worked after they learned. Many areas have also vigorously engaged in tool reforms related to garden plot management, focusing on solving deep plowing plows, levelers, ridging devices, as well as topdressing and pest control tools.

    深耕细作实现园田化
    山西以园田化为中心开展大面积丰产运动
    本报太原27日电　山西省各地在当前春耕生产中，轰轰烈烈地开展以耕作园田化为中心的大面积高额丰产运动。
    目前，向耕作园田化进军的活动在全省已普遍形成高潮，并取得了很大成绩。晋东南专区领导部门在晋城县高平人民公社召开了全专区园田化现场会议，交流了“引水上山、园田到坡”等山区实现耕作园田化的经验措施后，全区正以园田化的技术标准管理麦田，并采用大、中、小相结合、高标准低标准并举、平川山地一齐抓的办法，大搞春播耕地园田化建设运动。
    各地的园田化运动带动了整个春季生产。晋南专区根据棉、麦产区的特点，目前正开展园田化灌溉运动，全区到3月底，水地麦田要全部完成畦田灌溉化；水地棉、秋田要规划好道路、作好渠道、平整土地，为实现园田化打好水利基础。全区已提早灌水，保证小麦适时适量用水，保证棉、秋田灌溉保墒。晋中地区以园田化为纲开展的“早浇、快浇、多浇、浇好”春浇竞赛
  （每亩浇水六十公方），已经进入高潮。汾河、潇河、文峪河等灌区，最近一个月来已浇地四十多万亩，比去年同时期多浇地三分之一多。去年大跃进低产变高产的晋北专区，最近又掀起了高产再高产的丰产运动，计划在去年实行基本农田制的基础上，今年使三百五十多万亩耕地初步实现园田化。
    按照山西省农业建设厅汇总各地材料：目前各地规划的大面积高额丰产园田化耕地，大部分深耕一至三尺；3月中旬统计，已有三百八十八万亩基本农田初步达到了园田化的标准。全省各地正采取专业队与群众运动相结合的办法组织突击战役，争取在春播前，所有园田化耕地都可建设就绪。
    山西省委把开展以园田化为中心的大面积高额丰产运动，作为实现全省今年农业跃进规划的一项重大措施。根据农村劳动力、肥料、水利等方面的条件，采取由少到多、由低级到高级逐步实现的办法，今年全省平均每一人要一亩地实现园田化，全省将有一千六百万亩基本农田初步实现耕作园田化。省委还要求园田化耕地全年每亩用工三十个以上，深耕一尺至三尺，浇水三次以上，每亩施有机肥料三万至五万斤。在园田化耕地上要全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，争取亩产粮食一千五百斤到二千斤，亩产棉花三百到四百斤，亩产油料八百到一千斤，使这部分园田化耕地成为提高全省粮、棉、油料产量的基地。同时根据保证重点照顾一般的原则，实行大面积高产园田化耕地和一般耕地同时并举，保证一般耕地认真贯彻增产措施，实现全面大丰收。
    各地提出的初步实现耕作园田化的标准、措施，都因地制宜各有重点，大体上有九个方面：一、园田化的基础是水利，要作到啥时用水啥时有水，使耕地成为“无雨保丰收、多雨不受涝”，同时要开垅沟，划畦田。二、耕地要整修的
  “平如镜、细如面、埂像线”，便于保水、保土、保肥。三、深翻地，大量施肥、合理施肥，秋耕地分层施底肥，播种时随种随施肥，作物拔节、孕穗、开花、灌浆期分别施追肥。四、规划耕作区，使作物区域化，根据土壤、气候等条件因地因时分布作物，以便全面高产。五、按作物、分品种、看土壤合理密植。幼苗出土后多查多补达到苗全苗壮。六、粮食、棉花、油料、蔬菜全部采用优良品种。七、推广套种、间作、复播，实现一年多作。八、田间无草，消灭病虫害。九、在田间管理上要贯彻分期分作物加工的办法。
    为了使耕作园田化顺利开展，各级党、政组织都采取了一系列相应措施。除在全省范围内交流了晋北原代县地区峨口乡去年试验园田化粮食平均亩产六百斤翻一番的经验外，各地还组织了一部分干部、农民代表到外地参观学习。晋城等县进行了园田化技术大传授大训练，先搞一部分“示范田”，组织干部农民参观，不会就学，学会就干。许多地区还大搞有关园田化的工具改革，着重解决深耕犁、平地机、筑埂器以及追肥、治虫工具。（杨义）
