    Shoes
    Shi Jing
    There was a phone call from the mail room, asking me to pick up a package. The comrade in the mail room handed me a small package and a letter. I took the small package, felt it, long and hard, what was it? I couldn't wait to cut the tightly sewn thread as I walked, and untied the wrapping cloth: "Shoes!" Yes, a pair of black cloth shoes with cloth soles. From the style of the shoes, from the fine and dense stitches, I could tell who made them. Unconsciously, I squeezed them tightly and pressed them against my chest.
    "Who sent it to you? What is it?" Little Li asked me as soon as I entered the door.
    "My mother sent me the shoes!" I replied with a smile, and stretched the shoes out in front of him.
    Little Li said, "Your mother sent you shoes? She can get here from your house in half an hour by trolley, why bother the post office to send you a pair of shoes?"
    "No, they were sent from Hubei, sent by my Hubei mother."
    Last year I was sent down to Hubei for labor training. When I left, I took two pairs of shoes: a pair of old leather shoes and a pair of rubber-soled youth shoes. Of course, I couldn't wear leather shoes when working. I wore those youth shoes all day long, and there was no way to wash them, so the youth shoes were gray and black, and didn't look like much. At this time, I really hoped to have a pair of cloth shoes to change into, but the spring plowing was very tense, and I couldn't take the time to go to the street to buy them. Shiwen's mother (I lived in their home) saw this situation, and she wanted to cut a shoe pattern for me several times, to make me a pair of cloth shoes, but I always refused: firstly, I was embarrassed, and secondly, she was busy enough with housework, – there was no canteen at that time.
    One night, Shiwen and I came back from a meeting very late, but his mother was still sewing shoe soles by the dim lamplight. Seeing us come back, she turned the light up a bit, poured a bowl of boiled water, and said, "The meeting is over! Have some tea!"
    As I drank tea, I picked up the shoe sole on the table and said, "It's so late, you're still not sleeping, don't strain your eyes." When his mother saw me pick up the shoe sole, she asked with a smile, "Do you think it's well done?"
    "Yes, it's very strong! Is it for Shiwen? I'm afraid it's a little small?" I said.
    A few days later, when I came back from work in the afternoon, I found a pair of new cloth shoes on my bed. I thought Shiwen had forgotten them on my bed, so I took them out to return them to him, but he said they weren't his.
    "How can they not be yours? Mom made them for you last time. I don't want them."
    "Who says you don't want them? See who they fit, and give them to him! Go wash your feet quickly." Mother came out of the kitchen, brushing off the dust as she spoke.
    Shiwen and I washed our feet, and when Shiwen put on the new shoes, he couldn't get them on no matter what he did. He put the shoes in front of me: "Try them on!"
    Since Shiwen couldn't wear them, I thought I would try them on; unexpectedly, they fit perfectly. I stood up and took a few steps. Perhaps it was the first time I had worn cloth shoes, and I felt like I had never worn such comfortable shoes before.
    "How is it? Do they fit?" Shiwen's wife asked from the side. Before I could answer, his mother said, "No mistake!" I understood: Mother specially made the shoes for me! But how could they fit my feet so well? And where did Mother get the shoe pattern from? It was impossible to take the shoe pattern from leather shoes, and I wore my youth shoes all the time.
    "Do you remember the day you went to harrow the field?" Shiwen's wife asked with a smile. Harrowing the field? I remember. That was the first time I went barefoot into the field, to exercise my feet. I remember that when I came back from work, I deliberately carried my youth shoes and ran back barefoot. But what does this have to do with Mother making shoes? I didn't understand!
    "You, alas! Mother just traced the shoe pattern from the footprints you left in the mud!" Seeing that I still didn't understand, Shiwen's wife said loudly, as if blaming me for being too stupid.
    "Mother, you...!" What words could describe my feelings at that time? However, his mother laughed: "Mother's eyes aren't failing yet!"
    Later, his mother made me another pair of shoes, and I brought both pairs of shoes back to Beijing.
    "What are you thinking about? What does the letter say?" Little Li pushed me and woke me up. I handed him the letter. He began to read the letter.
    "The letter has been received, and the books and Chairman Mao's picture you sent have also been received. Everyone at home is fine, but they miss you very much. ... Mother asked me to send you a pair of shoes. I don't know if you will like them. Mother is afraid that you won't want these kinds of shoes when you return to Beijing. ..." Little Li stopped reading here, and looked down at my feet: "Hey, seriously, after returning to Beijing, I never saw you wear those cloth shoes again. What, don't you like them?"
    My eyes returned to the black cloth shoes on the table. Yes, I haven't worn those two pairs of shoes since I returned to Beijing. Did I not want them? Didn't I like to wear them? No, I couldn't bear to wear them!

    鞋
    施荆
    收发室来了一个电话，叫我去取一个邮包。收发室里的同志递给我一个小包和一封信。我接过了小包，摸了摸，长长的，硬硬的，是什么东西呢？我迫不及待地边走边割断了缝得密密的线，解开了包布：“鞋！”是的，一双黑面子布底鞋。从那鞋的样式，那细细密密的针脚上，我认得出来，这是谁做的。我不自觉地把它紧紧捏住按在胸前。
    “谁给你寄的？什么东西？”我刚一进门，小李就这样问我了。
    “我妈妈寄来的鞋子！”我笑着回答，一面把鞋子伸到他面前。
    小李说：“你妈妈寄来的鞋？她从你家乘电车半个钟点就到了，给你双鞋子还要麻烦邮局？”
    “不，是打湖北寄来的，是我湖北的妈妈寄来的。”
    去年我下放到湖北劳动锻炼，走时带了两双鞋：一双旧皮鞋，一双胶底青年鞋。劳动时当然不能穿皮鞋，成天就穿着那双青年鞋，没法拿它洗一洗，这样，那双青年鞋就灰不灰、黑不黑，不像个样子。这时，我真希望有双布鞋换一换，但春耕很紧张，顾不得上街去买。这情形，世文的妈妈（我就住在他们家里）也看到了，她几次要替我剪个鞋样，要给我做双布鞋，但我总不答应：一则，不好意思，再说，家里事情也够她忙的，——那时还没有食堂。
    有天晚上我和世文开完会回来，很迟了，但妈妈却还就着昏黄的灯火在纳鞋底。看到我们回来，她把灯扭亮一些，倒了碗开水，说：“会开完了！喝茶吧！”
    我一面喝茶一面拿起了放在桌上的鞋底，说：“这么晚了，你还不睡，别把眼睛熬花了。”妈妈看到我拿起了鞋底，笑着问：“你说做得好不好？”
    “好，很结实啊！给世文哥做的？恐怕小了一点？”我说。
    过了几天，下午放工回来，我发现我床上有双新布鞋，我想大约是世文哥忘记在我床上的，我就拿出去还给他，可是他却说不是他的。
    “怎么不是你的呢，上次妈妈替你做的。我不要。”
    “谁说不要？看谁穿合适，就给谁！快倒水洗脚去。”妈妈从灶房里出来一面拍灰一面说。
    我和世文洗完了脚，世文一穿那双新鞋，怎么也穿不上，他把鞋放在我面前：“你穿穿看！”
    既然世文哥穿不下，我想我就试试看；不想一穿进去，竟然非常合适。我站起来，走了几步，也许我还是第一次穿布鞋，觉得从来没有穿过这样舒服的鞋子。
    “怎么样？合适不合适？”世文嫂子在一旁瞧着问。还没等我回答，妈妈就说：“错不了！”我心里明白了：妈妈特地为我做的鞋！可是怎么会这样合我的脚呢，妈妈又是从哪里来的鞋样？从皮鞋上取鞋样那是不可能的，青年鞋我是脚不离鞋，鞋不离脚的。
    “你记得那天去耙田吗？”世文嫂笑着问我。耙田？我记得啊。那天是我第一次赤脚下田，为了要锻炼锻炼那双脚，我记得放工回来时，还故意提着青年鞋赤脚跑回来。但这同妈妈做鞋子有什么关系呢？我不懂！
    “你啊，唉！妈妈就是从你留在泥地上的脚印，把鞋样描下来的！”世文嫂子看我还不懂，有些怪我太笨似的大声说穿了。
    “妈妈，你……！”用什么话能说明我那时的心情呢？然而，妈妈却笑了起来：“妈妈的眼睛还不花吧！”
    以后，妈妈还为我做过一双鞋，这两双鞋我都带回北京来了。
    “你在想什么，信上怎么说？”小李一推把我惊醒了，我把信递给了他。他读起信来了。
    “来信收到，寄来的书和毛主席像也收到了。家里人很好，就是很想念你。……妈妈叫我寄上一双鞋子，不知你欢喜不欢喜，妈妈怕你回到北京不会要这种鞋子了。……”小李读到这里不往下念了，却低头瞧了瞧我的脚：“咦，说真的，回北京后，我就再也没看到你穿那双布鞋了，怎么，不喜欢了？”
    我把眼光又回到桌上那双黑布鞋上。是的，回北京后我就再没有穿过那两双鞋。是我不要了？不喜欢穿了？不，我是舍不得穿啊！
