Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 29th: People of all nationalities and from all walks of life in Xining City unanimously denounced the crimes of a handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet for betraying the motherland, colluding with imperialism, and gathering bandits to openly launch a rebellion.

    Teachers and students of all nationalities at Qinghai Nationalities Institute unanimously believe that the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces has not caused a regression in Tibet, but has promoted the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. Duo Jie Jian Zan, Deputy Director of the Academic Affairs Office, said: The rebellion instigated by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet goes against the interests of the Tibetan people, and it is entirely correct for the Central Government to order the People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion. Zhang Jinzhong, a Hui student, said: We have always hoped that the Tibetan people can move towards a happy and fulfilling socialist life like us. However, due to the obstruction of the reactionary forces, this could not be quickly realized. Now that the rebellion in Lhasa has been crushed, although I am a Hui, I am happy for the Tibetan people.

    Responsible persons from various organizations and groups also unanimously supported the State Council's order to thoroughly suppress the Tibetan rebellion. Gu Jia Sai (Tibetan), Deputy Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee, said: We fully support the order issued by the State Council and hope that the government will severely punish those unrepentant reactionary elements. The Central Government has always adopted a lenient attitude towards these reactionary elements, waiting for them to come to their senses, but they have stubbornly refused to do so and have even intensified their rebellion. Today, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is ordered to quell the rebellion, and we, the Tibetan people of Qinghai Province, express our firm support.

    Luo Sang Zha Xi, Director of the Xining Office of the Panchen Lama, said: I felt very indignant when I heard the news that Tibetan traitors were colluding with imperialism and gathering bandits to carry out a rebellion. The open rebellion of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet is a complete betrayal of the interests of the Tibetan people and a criminal act of betraying the motherland and undermining the unification of the motherland. However, all their conspiracies are in vain. Not only will they fail to achieve their goal of undermining the unification of the motherland, but the result will be to promote the consolidation of the unification of the motherland, promote the demise of the reactionary forces in Tibet, and promote the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. Therefore, the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government, dismiss the reactionary elements from their posts, and order the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion is completely correct and entirely necessary, and we express our full support.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 29th: The heinous crimes of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to carry out armed rebellion have aroused great indignation among the people of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They firmly support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion, and express their respect to the heroic People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the broad masses of patriotic Tibetan monks and laypeople.

    Ha Feng'a (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: The people of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region firmly support the measures taken by the State Council to safeguard the unification of the motherland and national unity. This small handful of traitors in Tibet have not only betrayed the interests of the motherland, but also betrayed the interests of the Tibetan people. They will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

    Workers of Mongolian, Han, Hui, and other nationalities at the Hohhot No. 1 Woolen Textile Factory unanimously believe that this rebellion was created by imperialism and Tibetan reactionaries in an attempt to undermine our country's unification and national unity. Therefore, we must resolutely eliminate this small handful of bandits and safeguard the unification of our great motherland. Yue Ke Jin Xiang Niu and Ren Qing, Mongolian herdsmen from the Ulanqab League and Xilin Gol League grasslands, said: The sooner the Tibetan rebellion is quelled, the sooner the Tibetan brothers will be able to obtain a democratic new life. At a gathering held by teachers and students of the Inner Mongolia Normal College, everyone expressed their utmost indignation at the crimes of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet for betraying the motherland and undermining national unity, and unanimously expressed their firm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion.

    Lama Bala Deng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, said that the rebellion of a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet does not have the support of the Tibetan people, and the fact that patriotic monks and laypeople in Lhasa assisted the People's Liberation Army in quickly quelling the rebellion proves this point. He also said that the reactionary forces in Tibet have embarked on the road to self-destruction, and the day when the Tibetan people completely get rid of the dark feudal serf system is getting closer and closer. We lamas in the Inner Mongolia Buddhist community warmly celebrate the victory of the Tibetan people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 29th: People of all nationalities and from all walks of life in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion, believing that this is in line with the wishes and interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all nationalities throughout the country. They believe that the failure of the Tibetan rebellion promotes the consolidation of the unification of the motherland, and promotes the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

    Zakelov, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, said: The traitorous activities of the Tibetan traitors have a long history. For many years, the Central Government has been waiting for the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique to repent, but they have not repented and have instead carried out armed rebellion. Crushing the rebellion is in the interest of the Tibetan people and also in the interest of all ethnic minorities throughout the country. We, the people of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, resolutely support the State Council's order and resolutely condemn the Tibetan traitors who attempt to split our motherland.

    Major General Tao Danov, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, said: The policy adopted by the Central Government this time is entirely correct, and I firmly support it. A small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement and instigated armed rebellion, violating the Constitution. This is intolerable to every patriot in the country.

    Teachers and students of all nationalities at Xinjiang College expressed their firm support after seeing the order issued by the State Council.

    Balati and Zhang Wan You (Hui), members of the farm implement repair shop of the Red Star People's Commune in the suburbs of Urumqi, said that the Tibetan people are patriotic, the conspiracy of the Tibetan reactionary clique will be completely crushed, and we resolutely support the State Council's order. Ma Jin (Hui), Director of the Tuanjie Road Office in Urumqi City, also said that thoroughly crushing the Tibetan rebellion clique is the wish of the Tibetan people and also the wish of our Hui people. We will never allow any reactionary elements to undermine the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities.

    青海、内蒙古、新疆各族人民声讨西藏叛国集团
    铲除民族败类  巩固民族团结
    新华社西宁29日电　西宁市各族各界人民一致声讨西藏一小撮上层反动分子背叛祖国，勾结帝国主义纠集叛匪公然发动叛乱的罪行。
    青海民族学院的各族教员和学生一致认为，西藏反动势力的叛乱不是造成了西藏的倒退，而是促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。教务处副处长多结坚赞说：西藏上层反动集团策动叛乱，是违背西藏人民利益的，中央责成人民解放军平息叛乱是完全正确的。回族学生张进忠说：我们一直盼望西藏人民能和我们一样走向幸福、美满的社会主义。但由于反动势力的阻挠，不能很快得以实现。现在粉碎了拉萨市区的叛乱，我虽然是个回民，也为西藏人民高兴。
    各机关团体负责人也一致拥护国务院关于彻底讨平西藏叛乱的命令。青海省人民委员会副秘书长古嘉赛（藏族）说：我们完全拥护国务院所发布的命令，希望政府严惩那些怙恶不悛的反动分子。中央对这些反动分子一直采取宽大为怀的态度，等待他们觉悟，但他们却执迷不悟，甚至变本加厉地进行叛乱。今天英勇的中国人民解放军奉命讨平叛乱，我们青海省藏族人民表示坚决拥护。
    西藏班禅驻西宁办事处处长罗桑扎喜说：听到西藏叛国分子勾结帝国主义、纠集叛匪进行叛乱的消息，感到非常愤慨。西藏上层一小撮反动分子公然叛乱，这是完全违背西藏人民的利益的，是背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一的罪恶行为。但是他们的一切阴谋都只是枉费心机，不但不能达到其破坏祖国统一的目的，其结果是促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏民主化和西藏人民的新生。因此，国务院命令解散西藏地方政府，撤销反动分子的职务，命令中国人民解放军西藏军区平息叛乱是完全正确和完全必要的，我们表示完全拥护。
    据新华社呼和浩特29日电　西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义进行武装叛乱的滔天罪行，激起了内蒙古自治区各族人民的极大愤慨，他们坚决拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令，并且向英勇的人民解放军驻西藏部队和广大的藏族爱国僧俗人民表示敬意。
    内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿（蒙古族）说：内蒙古自治区各族人民坚决拥护国务院为维护祖国统一和民族团结所采取的措施。西藏的这一小撮叛国分子，不但背叛了祖国的利益，也背叛了西藏人民的利益，他们必将遭到可耻的失败。
    呼和浩特第一毛纺织厂的蒙、汉、回等族职工们一致认为，这次叛乱是帝国主义和西藏反动分子妄想破坏我国统一和民族团结而制造的。因此我们一定要坚决消灭这一小撮叛匪，维护我们伟大祖国的统一。来自乌兰察布盟和锡林郭勒盟草原上的蒙古族牧民月克金祥牛、仁青说：西藏叛乱平息的越快，藏族兄弟就能越快的得到民主新生活。在内蒙古师范学院师生们举行的集会上，大家对西藏上层反动集团背叛祖国和破坏民族团结的罪行表示无比愤慨，并一致表示坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令。
    中国佛教协会内蒙古自治区分会副秘书长巴拉登喇嘛说，西藏的一小撮反动分子的叛乱，在藏族人民中是得不到支持的，拉萨爱国僧俗人民协助人民解放军迅速平定叛乱，就证明了这一点。他还说，西藏的反动势力走向了自取灭亡的道路，藏族人民彻底摆脱黑暗的封建农奴制度的日子，更加临近了。我们内蒙古佛教界喇嘛为藏族人民的胜利热烈欢呼。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐29日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族各界人民坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令，认为这符合西藏人民以及全国各族人民的愿望和利益，并认为西藏叛乱的失败促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    新疆维吾尔自治区副主席扎克洛夫说：西藏叛国分子的叛国活动，由来已久，中央多年来一直等待着西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的悔改，但他们并没有悔改，反而进行了武装叛乱。粉碎叛乱符合西藏人民的利益，也符合全国各少数民族的利益。我们新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民坚决拥护国务院的命令，坚决谴责妄图分裂我们祖国的西藏叛国分子。
    新疆军区政治部副主任桃达诺夫少将说：这次中央所采取的政策是完全正确的，我坚决拥护。西藏的一小撮反动分子公然撕毁了十七条协议，策动武装叛乱，违反宪法，这是全国每一个爱国者所不能容忍的。
    新疆学院的各族师生看到国务院发布的命令后，都表示坚决拥护。
    乌鲁木齐市郊区红星人民公社农具修配厂的社员巴拉提、张万邮（回族）说，西藏人民是爱国的，西藏反动集团的阴谋必将被彻底粉碎，我们坚决拥护国务院的命令。乌鲁木齐市团结路办事处主任马金（回）也说，彻底粉碎西藏叛乱集团是西藏人民的愿望，也是我们回族人民的愿望。我们决不允许任何反动分子破坏祖国的统一和各族人民的团结。
