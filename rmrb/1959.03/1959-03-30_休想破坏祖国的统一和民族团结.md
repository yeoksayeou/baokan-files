To the Editor:

    The news of the rebellion by the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique has enraged us four Tibetan students studying in Medical Class 3 of Beijing Medical College. We resolutely support Premier Zhou's order from the State Council to thoroughly quell and crush the rebel group. These national scum and running dogs of imperialism must be completely eliminated. The imperialists' attempt to reverse the wheel of history is a dream that can never be realized. The friendship between the Tibetan and Han people is as close as flesh and blood, and cannot be divided by anyone. The awakened Tibetan people must, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work together with our Han brothers to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and to build a new, democratic, and free Tibet!

    休想破坏祖国的统一和民族团结编辑同志：
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团叛乱的消息传来，激怒了我们四个在北京医学院医三班学习的藏族同学。我们坚决拥护国务院周总理的命令，彻底平息粉碎叛乱集团，对这些民族的败类、帝国主义的走狗一定要彻底地消灭。帝国主义妄想倒退历史的巨轮，那是一定不能实现的梦想。藏汉族人民的友谊血肉相联，决不能被任何人所分割。觉悟了的藏族人民一定要在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，同汉族兄弟为巩固祖国的统一和民族团结、为建设民主自由的新西藏而共同奋斗！
