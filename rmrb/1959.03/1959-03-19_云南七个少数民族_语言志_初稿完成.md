Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 17th—Preliminary drafts of the "Language Records" for the seven ethnic minorities inhabiting the Yunnan border regions—the Hani, Dai, Kawa, Naxi, Lahu, Lisu, and Jingpo—have recently been completed.

These "Language Records" for the seven ethnic groups were compiled by the Yunnan Provincial Ethnic Minorities Language Guidance Work Committee and the Third Work Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Ethnic Minority Language Survey, starting at the end of 1956.

In the compilation process, the staff first went deep into ethnic minority villages in the border areas, living, eating, and working alongside the masses, relying on the masses, and extensively collecting language materials. Subsequently, they invited people from each ethnic group who were familiar with their own language to jointly conduct analysis and research.
