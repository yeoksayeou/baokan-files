    Such "National Security"!
    Editor:
    The facts revealed in your newspaper's March 11th article, "The Furor Caused by Two Turbines," powerfully expose the essence of the US and British governments' constant talk of economic "cooperation" and "interdependence."

    From this short article, it can be seen that this "cooperation" went bankrupt over even two turbines. Washington, in order to strike a blow against its British competitor in trade, did not hesitate to use the big stick of "national security interests" to prevent a British company from obtaining a contract for two turbines; but at the same time, American goods flooded the British market, and American capital dangerously infiltrated every sector of the British national economy. An American corporation even devoured a British company in a robber-like manner by buying up all its shares, while all of this seemed to pose no "national security interests" to Britain at all!

    The term "national security" in the United States has become a fig leaf it often uses to carry out expansion and aggression against other countries. For more than a decade, Washington has used the banner of "national security" in pursuing its aggressive policies. It sets up a vast network of bases abroad for "security," and it expands its military and prepares for war at home, forcing its people to tighten their belts, also for "security." A set of methods for expanding abroad with "US aid" as "bait" is called the "Mutual Security Program"; the establishment of aggressive military blocs around the world is also said to be a "security measure to supplement the inadequacies of the United Nations." It invades the Middle East, and then engages in military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, also for "security." For example, in a letter to Senator Green last October, Eisenhower called the United States' occupation of China's Taiwan area a matter of American "security." The people of all countries see very clearly the despicable deeds the United States does behind the cloak of "national security."

    Unexpectedly, the United States, which styles itself as a "protector," also uses the banner of "national security" to exclude, attack, and devour its allies. Even the British Electric Company's bid for two turbines threatened America's "national security interests." Only allowing itself to devour others, while not allowing others to eat a bite, this is the essence of America's "national security interests." The beautiful words of "US-British alliance," "free trade," and "friendly cooperation" that Washington sings are nothing more than a sinister curtain used by American monopoly capitalist groups to conceal their intention to drown their competitors.

    The British government's anger and excitement over the turbine bidding dispute is understandable. However, the fact that the American "alliance leader" everywhere excludes Britain, seizes Britain's sphere of influence and markets, severely strikes at Britain's international status, and ties Britain to the American war chariot, does not arouse the anger and excitement it should in London. How can this be understood? This alone shows to what an unimaginable degree Britain's own position has fallen due to blindly following the United States.

### 如此“国家安全”！

    如此“国家安全”！编辑同志：
    你报3月11日刊载的“两部涡轮机引起的轩然大波”一文所透露的事实，有力地揭示了美国政府人士所一贯津津乐道的美英经济上“互相合作”和“互相依靠”的实质。
    从这篇短文里可以看出，这种“合作”甚至在两部涡轮机上就宣告了破产。华盛顿为了在贸易上打击它的英国对手竟不惜搬出“国家安全利益”的大帽子来阻止英国公司取得两只涡轮机的订货合同；但同时美国公司的货物却充斥于英国市场，美国资本则危险地渗透到英国国民经济的每个部门，美国的一家大公司还用收买全部股票的强盗方式吃掉了一家英国公司，而这一切似乎对英国根本不存在什么“国家安全利益”！
    “国家安全”一词在美国变成了它经常用来进行扩张和侵略别国的一块遮羞布。十多年来，华盛顿在推行侵略政策时，无不打着“国家安全”的幌子。它在国外广设基地网是为了“安全”，在国内扩军备战、要人民勒紧腰带也是为了“安全”；以“美援”作“诱饵”向外扩张的一套办法被命名为“共同安全计划”；在世界各地建立侵略性军事集团也被说成是一项“以补充联合国之不足的安全措施”。它侵略中东，然后在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅，也说是为了“安全”。例如去年10月艾森豪威尔在给参议员格林的信中，就把美国强占我国台湾地区称作是事关美国的“安全”。各国人民对于美国在“国家安全”背后干的卑鄙勾当，是看得十分清楚的。
    想不到以“保护者”自居的美国，对它的盟国的排挤、打击和吞啮，竟也打出“国家安全”的幌子。而且连英国电气公司对两部涡轮机的投标也威胁了美国的“国家安全利益”。只许自己对别人狼吞虎咽，而不给别人吃一口饭，这就是美国的“国家安全利益”所在。华盛顿高唱的“美英联盟”、“自由贸易”、“友好合作”的美妙词句，不过是美国垄断资本集团用以掩盖它的一心要淹死它的竞争者的阴险的一张帷幕。
    英国政府对这次两部涡轮机投标纠纷引起的愤怒和激动，是可以理解的。但是，美国“盟主”到处排挤英国，夺取英国势力范围和市场，狠狠地打击英国的国际地位，并把英国绑在美国的战车上，这一切却没有引起伦敦应有的愤怒和激动，这又怎样理解呢？仅仅这一点就可以看到，由于一味追随美国，英国自己的地位已降到何等不堪设想的地步了。
