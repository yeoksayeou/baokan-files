Taking Steel as the Key Link to Drive Overall Leaps Forward in Industrial Production
Zhao Lin, Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Jilin Province has relatively rich natural resources and convenient transportation conditions for industrial production. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the province's industrial production grew at an average annual rate of 17.1%. Under normal circumstances, this speed is not considered small. However, compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this speed seems low. The reason for this, of course, has many factors, one of the most important of which is that steel production was blank, and the machinery industry was very weak. This limited the development of heavy industry. The proportion of light industry in the entire industry was relatively large (in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, the proportion of light industrial production accounted for more than half of the entire industrial production), and the development speed of light industry was restricted by agricultural harvests. This had to limit the development speed of the entire industry. Practice has shown that it is impossible to promote a Great Leap Forward in industrial production without taking steel as the key link. Only when the iron and steel industry develops and the corresponding machinery industry is established can more tools and equipment be manufactured to arm all light and heavy industries, while gradually arming agriculture. With the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, more industrial raw materials will inevitably be produced, which will also promote the overall development and Great Leap Forward of light industry and the entire industry.

Last September, under the instructions of the Central Committee, we took the development of the iron and steel industry as the central task of the entire party, and launched a high tide of the whole party and the whole people running the iron and steel industry. Once we grasped this key link, a new situation of "one horse taking the lead, ten thousand horses galloping" appeared, and the overall leap forward of industrial production and the national economy was realized. Steel production went from zero to one, with steel and iron completing 119% and 124% of the state plan, respectively. Driven by this, the total industrial output value increased by 49% compared with 1957, overfulfilling the state plan. More importantly, we gained rich experience in the Great Leap Forward, the political awareness of the vast number of workers has been greatly improved, the technical team has been greatly developed, more than a dozen steel bases such as Tonghua have also taken initial shape, and the great agricultural harvest in 1958 has prepared more raw materials for light industry, which has laid a solid foundation for further development.

The current weak links in steel production are the shortage of coal, electricity, and transportation capacity, and we are concentrating our efforts to solve these problems. In the first quarter, we should do a good job in the preparatory work for steel production and pass the three "hurdles" (basic construction of coal washing and coke production, improving steel quality, and reducing steel production costs and raw material consumption quotas). In the second quarter, we should launch a high tide of steel production. Throughout the year, we must vigorously carry out mass movements and technical revolutions to ensure the victorious completion of the 1959 industrial production tasks.

The Great Leap Forward in 1958 was a great practice in China's socialist construction. We not only reaped unprecedentedly great harvests in production and ideology, but also gained extremely rich experience in the working methods of the mass line. The main point of this experience is that we must vigorously carry out mass movements in all our work. Vigorously carrying out mass movements is the main method to ensure the completion of our various tasks and a fundamental measure to realize the continuous leap forward of industrial production in our province in the future.

According to the development of the mass movement and the requirements of industrial production in our province, the main direction and content of vigorously carrying out mass movements in 1959 should be:

First, vigorously carry out technical revolutions. This is the main source of tapping the production potential of industrial and transportation enterprises. Practice has proved that the production potential of an industrial enterprise is very large, especially for newly built modern large and medium-sized enterprises. As long as the masses of workers are widely mobilized to vigorously carry out technical revolutions and break through the original design capabilities, not only can one factory be turned into two, but also one factory can be turned into five. Among the 60 state-owned and provincial-operated industrial and mining enterprises in our province, a quarter of the factories and mines increased their actual output value by more than one time in 1958 compared with 1957. For example, the actual output of Jilin Fertilizer Factory more than doubled, and the production capacity of Changchun Automobile Factory this year is expected to increase four times, from the original designed capacity of 30,000 vehicles per year to a production level of 150,000 vehicles per year. This amazing growth is mainly the result of tapping the production potential of existing enterprises.

Organizing high-yield movements is an extremely important issue in vigorously carrying out mass movements in factories and enterprises. Only through organizing high-yield movements can we mobilize and organize the strength of the masses, focus the wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of workers on the major key problems in production, overcome weak links, break the old balance, organize a new production balance, and achieve a greater leap forward in production on the basis of advanced production. The Party committees of various factories must mobilize and organize the masses, attract the attention of the vast number of workers to the issue of reforming production technology, and let them freely expose and solve problems in this regard.

The content of the technical revolution is multifaceted, including tools and equipment, product design, technological processes, technical operations, and factory design. There should be different requirements in different enterprises and at different times. But for any enterprise at any time, the most fundamental, most central, and most decisive issue is the revolution in tools and equipment. Only when tools and equipment are improved can labor productivity be maximized, more varieties be increased, and product quality be continuously improved. Therefore, we must actively prepare to launch an industrial technological revolution movement centered on the reform of tools and equipment. Industrial departments and factories and mines at all levels in the province should formulate technical revolution plans and specific requirements around this center.

Second, continue to mobilize the masses and implement the industrial "constitution" of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." Various rules and regulations in enterprises that hinder production leaps forward and the enthusiasm of the masses have been violently impacted by last year's rectification movement, and most of them have been eliminated. However, some enterprises have not completely broken them down and need to continue to break them down. But on the whole, the approach this year should be different from last year. If last year was mainly about breaking down, with establishing in the process of breaking down, then this year should be mainly about establishing, with breaking down in the process of establishing. Especially for the reform of those rules and regulations related to quality and safety, special caution should be taken. What needs to be broken down must be tested, respect science, and establish before breaking, so as to avoid causing confusion and losses.

The focus of implementing the "three combinations" should currently be on the work of uniting and educating technical personnel. After the great rectification movement, the ideological awareness of technical personnel in enterprises has been significantly improved. The views of some of them that despise labor and look down on workers have changed greatly, and their relationship with workers has also been greatly improved. At present, we should strengthen the work of uniting and educating technical personnel to give full play to their role in the technical revolution and the production leap forward movement.

To ensure the realization of the above tasks, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party. The focus of the Party's leadership should first be placed on continuing to boost morale and overcome new right-leaning conservatism. Through summarizing last year's experience, we should use countless vivid and concrete examples in the Great Leap Forward to carry out propaganda and education work, boost the morale of the masses, and increase confidence in completing tasks. The Party must strengthen the political and ideological work of the vast number of workers in a timely manner, vigorously carry out socialist and communist ideological education movements among the vast number of workers, especially strengthening the ideological education work of the approximately 200,000 new workers.

Among all cadres, in addition to continuing to strengthen the education of mass viewpoints and the mass line, we must also earnestly strengthen the education of the Party's policies and guidelines. At present, it is particularly necessary to focus on strengthening the ideological education of ensuring the implementation of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" to improve cadres' overall view and prevent and overcome decentralism and localism tendencies. It is required that every cadre learn to use Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis methods to specifically analyze the current production situation, find out its objective laws from it, and promote the continuous leap forward of industrial production in our province.

    以钢为纲，带动工业生产全面跃进
    中共吉林省委书记　赵林
    吉林省的工业生产，有着比较丰富的天然资源和比较便利的交通条件。在第一个五年计划期间，我省工业生产，平均每年增长17.1％。按常规来说，这个速度不算小，然而，和1958年的大跃进相比，这个速度就显得不高了。其所以如此，当然有很多原因，其中一个最主要的原因，是由于钢铁生产处于空白状态，机械工业又很薄弱，这限制了重工业的发展，轻工业在全部工业中占的比重较大（第一个五年计划的前四年轻工业生产比重占整个工业生产一半以上），而轻工业的发展速度又被农业收成丰歉所制约着，这就不能不限制了整个工业的发展速度。实践表明，如果不以钢为纲，就不可能推动工业生产的大跃进。只有钢铁工业发展了，相应的建立起机械工业，才能够制造出更多的工具和设备，来武装全部的轻重工业，同时逐步地把农业武装起来；随着农业机械化电气化的实现，必然会生产出更多的工业原料，也将促使轻工业以及整个工业的全面发展和跃进。
    去年9月，我们在中央的指示下，把发展钢铁工业作为全党的中心任务，掀起了全党全民大办钢铁工业的高潮。一抓住这条纲，就出现了一个“一马当先，万马奔腾”的新局面，实现了工业生产和国民经济的全面跃进。钢铁生产从无到有，钢和铁分别完成国家计划的119％和124％。在它的带动之下，工业总产值比1957年增长49％，超额完成了国家计划。更重要的是：我们在大跃进中取得了丰富的经验，广大职工的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，技术队伍有了很大的发展，通化等十几个钢铁基点也都初具规模，1958年的农业大丰收为轻工业准备了更多的原材料，这都为进一步发展奠定了坚实的基础。
    当前钢铁生产中的薄弱环节是煤炭、电力和运输力量的不足，我们正在集中力量解决这些问题。第一季度做好钢铁生产的备战工作，过好三个“关”（洗煤、焦炭生产的基本建设，提高钢铁质量，降低钢铁生产成本和原材料消耗定额）。第二季度发动钢铁生产高潮。在全年的工作中，都要大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，保证1959年工业生产任务的胜利完成。
    1958年的大跃进，是我国社会主义建设中的一个伟大实践，我们不仅在生产上和思想上获得了空前伟大的丰收，而且在群众路线的工作方法上，也取得了极其丰富的经验。这一经验的主要点，就在于一切工作中都必须大搞群众运动。大搞群众运动，是保证完成我们各项任务的主要方法，也是实现我省今后工业生产不断跃进的一项根本措施。
    根据我省当前群众运动的发展和工业生产的要求，在1959年内，大搞群众运动的主要方向和内容，应该是：
    第一、大闹技术革命。这是发挥工业交通企业生产潜力的主要源泉。实践证明：一个工业企业的生产潜力是很大的，新建的现代化的大中型企业更是如此。只要广泛地发动职工群众，大闹技术革命，突破原有设计能力，不仅一厂可以变两厂，而且一厂也可以变五厂。在我省六十个国营和省营工矿企业中，有四分之一的厂矿，1958年的实际产值比1957年增长一倍以上。如吉林肥料厂的实际产量翻了一番还多，而长春汽车厂今年的生产能力预计可提高四倍，由原设计能力的年产三万辆，提高到年产十五万辆的生产水平。这种惊人的增长，主要都是挖掘原有企业生产潜力的结果。
    组织高产运动，是在工厂企业中当前大搞群众运动的一个极为重要的问题。只有通过组织高产运动，才能调动与组织群众力量，围绕我们所提出的目标与任务，集中广大职工群众的智慧与革命干劲来解决生产中的主要关键问题，克服薄弱环节，打破旧的平衡，组织新的生产平衡，在先进的生产基础上，实现生产更大的跃进。各个工厂党委一定要发动与组织群众，把广大职工群众的注意力吸引到改革生产技术的问题上来，放手让他们揭露和解决这方面的问题。
    技术革命的内容是多方面的，它包含着工具设备、产品设计、工艺过程、技术操作、工厂设计等方面。在不同的企业和不同时间里，应有不同的要求。但是任何企业在任何的时间里，最根本、最中心、最起决定作用的问题，还是工具设备方面的革命。只有工具设备改进了，才能够最大限度地提高劳动生产率，增加更多的品种，不断地提高产品质量。因此，当前我们必须积极准备发动一个以工具设备改革为中心内容的工业技术革命运动，全省各级工业部门和厂矿企业都应该围绕着这一中心，来制定技术革命的规划和具体要求。
    第二、继续发动群众，贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”的工业“宪法”。企业中妨碍生产跃进和群众积极性的各种规章制度，已经受到去年整风运动的猛烈冲击，大部分都破除了。但是也有些企业破的不够彻底，还须继续大破，但就整个说来，在今年的作法上应与去年有所不同，如果说去年是以破为主，破中有立，那么，今年就应该是以立为主、立中有破，特别是对那些有关质量和安全方面规章制度的改革，应当特别慎重，要破的，必须经过试验，尊重科学、先立后破。以免招致混乱和损失。
    贯彻执行“三结合”的重点，当前应该放在团结与教育技术人员的工作上。经过伟大的整风运动，企业中技术人员的思想觉悟，有了显著提高。他们中某些人轻视劳动和看不起工人的观点，有了很大改变，他们与工人的关系，也有着很大改善。目前，应该加强对技术人员的团结和教育工作，以充分发挥他们在技术革命和生产跃进运动中的作用。
    要保证上述任务的实现，必须加强党的领导。党的领导重点首先应放在继续鼓足干劲和克服新的右倾保守方面。通过总结去年经验，用大跃进中无数生动具体的事例来进行宣传教育工作，鼓舞群众的斗志，提高完成任务的信心。党必须及时加强对广大职工群众的政治思想工作，要在广大职工中大力开展社会主义和共产主义思想教育运动，特别是要加强对为数约二十万的新工人的思想教育工作。
    在全体干部中，除了继续加强群众观点，群众路线的教育以外，还须认真加强党的方针政策的教育。目前尤其需要着重加强保证贯彻执行
  “全国一盘棋”的思想教育，以提高干部的全局观点，防止和克服分散主义和本位主义倾向。要求每个干部要学会用马列主义的科学分析方法，来具体分析当前的生产情况，从中找出其客观的规律，以促进我省工业生产的不断飞跃前进。
