The east wind is fierce at the foot of Mount Lu, and the waves are high on the shores of Poyang Lake. In spring, before the busy season of preparing for farming, there is continuous rain and relentless cold wind, but this cannot scare or stump the wise and courageous people.

Wind, blowing; rain, falling; what a sight it is on the earth!

Early in the morning, by the side of Poyang Lake, near Tie Men Village, there are crowds of people, with shouts of "? ? ?" echoing to the sky. Who is that? Ah, it is the members of the Jiaoxu People's Commune. They fight the wind and rain, battling Poyang Lake. Look! The double-铧 plow turns up the fertile soil like lightning, and the big carts transport the soil as if flying through the clouds. They work hard and cleverly, with each person accumulating 300 dan of fertilizer every day! That number is astonishing enough. But come and see by the side of Tanxi Temple: in the howling wind and rain, a thousand warriors are battling, mowing grass and沤粪 (pinyin ou fen, a kind of green compost fertilizer), their enthusiasm soaring! Who is that? Ah, it is Comrade Peng Wende, the county magistrate of Xingzi County. He is leading the cadres and commune members in competing with nature, braving the rain to fight for fertilizer. Sweat, pouring; songs, resounding; fertilizer mountains, constantly growing... This day, the whole commune accumulated 120,000 dan of fertilizer, doubling the usual progress. This miracle is outstanding, isn't it! But take another look at the nights on Dong'an Island: under the light of gas lamps, scythes gleam like snow, camps stretch for fifty li, two or three thousand heroes. Who is that? Ah, it is the fertilizer accumulation expeditionary force of the Liao Nan People's Commune! They are thousands strong, conquering Dong'an, forcing the grass fairy to surrender its treasures, and compelling the lake god to offer fertilizer. In just a few days, they broke through the million-dan mark in fertilizer accumulation! On the mountains, at the foot of the mountains, in the fields, beside the villages, men and women, young and old, cutting green grass and焖黄土 (pinyin men huang tu, cover yellow soil), burning 彩石 (cai shi, colored stones), shoveling green manure... The song of fighting for fertilizer resounds in every corner of the county.

Wind, blowing; rain, falling; what a sight it is on the earth!

At the Grey Mountain Pass, with twin peaks facing each other, at the Guanyintang Reservoir construction site, people are like the sea, vehicles like the tide, cannons roaring, songs floating. Here are the little Nezhas pushing carts as if flying, here are the middle-aged heroes fighting at night, here is the old hero Yin Fengtai, who is already sixty years old, here is Li Linying, who is closing the mountains for afforestation. They want to store clear water for raising fish, preventing drought, and irrigating good fields. They want to create a thousand years of happiness for future generations, and they want to block the ten thousand zhang flood for the crops. In this place where the Red Army fought in the past, next year there will be a scene of electric lights shining silver and golden acres playing in the autumn wind! Look again at the Zhongtangwei Reservoir: on the construction site, the sound of shoveling earth, the sound of carrying earth, the sound of footsteps, the sound of ramming, the sound of slogans, the sound of laughter, the sound of songs… Who are those young people with bare feet, carrying full baskets of soil, those young people who are rolling up their sleeves and shoveling earth non-stop, those young people who are ramming with soaring energy, those young people who sing the快板 (pinyin kuaiban, a kind of Chinese rhythmic talk show) the loudest? Ah, it is him - the Party Secretary of the commune, Cao Runfu! It is he who inspires people to improve efficiency, it is he who leads the commune members to build gold and silver reservoirs with their hands, it is he who leads the commune members to win happiness and harvest with labor. The wind, retreated, the rain, defeated. Yes, how can the wind and rain defeat the iron and steel heroes led by our Party!

Wind, blowing; rain, falling; what a sight it is on the earth!

By the side of Liaohua Pond, near Golden Village, the rapeseed flowers are yellow, and the wheat seedlings are tender and green. Ah, whose rice paddies are harrowed so well? Whose land is cultivated so deeply? Whose fertilizer heaps are growing so high? Whose ponds and weirs are clustered? Ah, this is the experimental field of labor model Wan Zhengbao, the high-yield field of production expert. This year, Wan Zhengbao has struck the loudest drum in the greater leap forward in the county. Their team wants to achieve large-scale, high-yield harvests, to achieve ten thousand jin per mu of millet and ten thousand jin of cotton! Ah, where is that? The hometown of the poet Tao Yuanming - at the foot of Mount Lu, near Wenquan Village, in the cowshed, in the cattle pen, the seedling-raising warm beds are scattered like stars, covered with warm thatched quilts, absorbing sufficient nutrients, the green and tender seedlings, stretching out their small fists from the thatched quilts to demonstrate to the wind and rain: "Wind, blow, rain, fall, we are not afraid! We only listen to our masters - the words of the commune members!" The rain, cried out, the wind, roared wildly, the commune's seedlings, issued a victorious laughter!

Wind, blowing; rain, falling; what a sight it is on the earth!

In the machinery factory beside Liuxu Alley, in the farm tool repair and assembly factory under Yuquan Mountain, in the agricultural cooperative factory beside Qijiao Dike, in all the farm tool manufacturing factories in the county, roaring furnaces are burning everywhere, the smell of shavings permeates everywhere, the sound of bamboo splitting rings everywhere, and the red flowers of the technical revolution are blooming everywhere. Thousands of diligent and brave workers are engaged in tireless labor. Thousands upon thousands of dilapidated farm tools have been repaired in their hands; thousands upon thousands of new-style farm tools have been produced from their hands, and self-made new-style seeders and Red Flag rice transplanters have been successfully made. They use their excellent labor to welcome this spring of triumphant east wind and greater leap forward together with their farmer brothers!

Wind, blowing; rain, falling; what a beautiful scene is rising on the earth!

Ninety-eight million dan of fertilizer, piled up ten thousand mountains; countless reservoir dams, locked in spring floods and autumn torrents; green and strong seedlings are growing in warm beds; tens of millions of new-style farm tools are rushing from factories to villages... Mount Lu is high, but not higher than the people's soaring enthusiasm, Poyang Lake water is large, but it cannot stop the heroes' determination to strive for the upper reaches! Wind, what is it! Rain, what is it! Look, the rising sun shines brightly, the heroic Xingzi people, have a good start, and the war drums are loud! ...

    鄱阳春色
    徐新杰
    庐山脚下东风猛，鄱阳湖畔浪头高。春天，备耕关前，霪雨连绵，寒风不绝，但这吓不倒、难不住智勇双全的人们。
    风，刮着；雨，下着；大地上是一片怎样的景色啊！
    清晨，鄱阳湖边，铁门村畔，人山人海，“呵嗬呵嗬”的?声连天。那是谁？啊，是蛟圩人民公社的社员。他们迎风斗雨，大战鄱阳湖。瞧！双铧犁起肥如闪电，大板车运土似穿云。他们苦干巧干，每人每天积肥达到三百担！这数字够惊人了。可是，你到滩溪庙旁来看看吧：狂风雨下，战将千名，打草沤粪，干劲冲天！那是谁？啊，是我们星子县的县长彭文德同志。是他带领着干部和社员们在与天比武，冒雨争肥。汗，淌着，歌，响着，肥山，不断的长着……这一天，全社积肥十二万担，比平常的进度整整翻了一番。这奇迹算突出了吧！可是，你再看看东安洲上的夜晚吧：汽灯光下，镰刀似雪，连营五十里，好汉两三千。那是谁？啊，那是了南人民公社的积肥远征军！他们千军万马，征战东安，叫草仙交宝，逼湖神献肥。不几天工夫，他们就突破了百万担的积肥大关！山上、山下、田野、村旁，男男女女、老老少少，割青草焖黄土，烧彩石，铲绿肥……全县每一个角落都响起了为肥而战的歌声。
    风，刮着；雨，下着；大地上是一片怎样的景色啊！
    灰山隘口，双峰对峙，观音塘水库的工地上，人似海，车如潮，炮声响，歌声飘。这儿有推车如飞的小哪吒，这儿有夜战的壮年英雄，这儿有年已六旬的老英雄殷逢太，这儿有封山治水的李林英。他们要拦蓄清水养鱼、防旱、灌良田。他们要为后代造千年福，他们要为庄稼拦住万丈洪。在这昔日红军征战的地方，明年将是一片电灯银光闪，黄金万顷戏秋风！再看看中塘尾水库吧：工地上，铲土声一片，挑土声一片，脚板声一片，打夯声一片，号子声一片，欢笑声一片，歌声一片……那打着赤脚、挑着满筐泥土的青年人，那卷起袖子铲土不歇的青年人，那打夯干劲冲天的青年人，那快板唱得最响的青年人，是谁？啊，是他——公社的党委书记曹润夫！是他鼓舞着人们把工效提高，是他带领着社员们，用双手修起了金银水库，是他带领着社员们用劳动夺取幸福和丰收。风，退却了，雨，败阵了。是啊，风雨怎么战得过我们党所领导的钢铁英雄！
    风，刮着；雨，下着；大地上是一片怎样的景色啊！
    蓼花池畔，黄金村边，菜花黄一片，麦苗嫩又青。啊，是谁的秧田耙得这么好？是谁的土地耕得这样深？是谁的肥堆长得这样高？是谁的塘堰一群群？啊，这是劳动模范万正保的试验地，是生产能手的高产田。今年万正保打响了全县更大跃进中最响的一鼓。他们队要实现大面积高额丰产，要实现亩产万斤谷子万斤棉！啊，那是哪里？诗人陶渊明的家乡——庐山脚下，温泉村边，牛棚里，牛栏内，育秧的温床星罗棋布，复盖着温暖的茅被，吸收着充足的养分，绿油油的嫩苗，从茅被里伸出了小拳头向风雨示威：“风，你刮吧，雨，你下吧，我们不怕！我们只听我们的主人——公社社员的话！”雨，气哭了，风，气得乱吼乱叫，公社的秧苗啊，发出了胜利的欢笑！
    风，刮着；雨，下着；大地上是一片怎样的景色啊！
    在柳絮巷边的机械厂里，在玉泉山下的农具修配厂里，在起蛟圩畔的农具合作工厂里，在全县各个农具制造工厂里，到处燃着熊熊的炉火，到处泛着刨花香，到处响着嚓嚓的劈篾声，到处开放着技术革命的红花。千百名勤劳勇敢的工人，进行着不知疲乏的劳动。成千上万的破旧农具，在他们的手里修好了；成千上万的新式农具，从他们的手里产生了，自制的新式播种机和红旗插秧机成功了。他们用自己出色的劳动，和农民兄弟一道迎接了这个东风得意、更大跃进的春天！
    风，刮着；雨，下着；大地上升起了一片怎样的美景啊！
    九千八百万担肥料，堆起了高山万座；无数的水库堤坝，锁住了春泛秋洪；绿油油的壮秧在温床里成长；千万件新式农具，从工厂奔向了村庄……庐山高啊，高不过人民的冲天干劲，鄱阳湖水大，阻不住英雄争上游的决心！风，算什么！雨，算什么！看，初升的太阳光芒万丈，英雄的星子人民，旗开得胜，战鼓喧天！……
