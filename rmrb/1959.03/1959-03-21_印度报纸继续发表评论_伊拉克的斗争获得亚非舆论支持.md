Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 19th: Indian newspapers continue to publish comments criticizing the United Arab Republic (UAR) President Nasser’s attacks on Iraq and its government leaders.

The “Amrita Bazar Patrika” stated on the 18th that the only ones comfortable with the situation caused by the UAR authorities' open opposition to Iraq "are the imperialists, while the Arab people are determined to liberate themselves from imperialist rule."

The newspaper said, "It is undeniable that the July Revolution in Iraq, as Khrushchev said, has the support of all progressive forces." It added that Nasser's current attitude is due to "Iraq's refusal to unite with the UAR."

The Bengali-language newspaper “Ananda Bazar Patrika” said in an editorial on the 18th, “Those who are happy about the strengthening of Arab nationalism in West Asia are now very disturbed by the division between these two countries and their leaders.”

The newspaper said that some understanding has already been reached between Nasser and Western countries. Western countries still oppose the Iraqi government because it opposes the Baghdad Pact and the recent bilateral military agreements signed by the United States with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan in Ankara.

The "Free Press Journal" said in a lengthy editorial on the 18th, "In addition to attacking the unity between Arab communists and Arab nationalists – a unity that fights for anti-imperialism and supports the development of national independence – Nasser has also begun to create division and disunity among nationalists."

The newspaper said that by using weapons like blind anti-communism and medieval religious fanaticism, "the imperialists have repeatedly tried to divide Arab unity, and in the past, Nasser himself has had to deal with this situation. How can Nasser forget this? Even if Nasser's memory has become dull due to the effects of visits from Rountree, Tito, Black, and others, the people of the Asian and African world, the people of the Arab countries, and even the people of Syria and Egypt cannot forget all of this."

The newspaper said that resistance to imperialist conspiracies must not be divided.

The newspaper condemned Nasser's actions in interfering in Iraq's internal affairs, stating, "Iraq's determination will gain the support of public opinion throughout the Asian and African world."

The newspaper concluded, "We must support the Arab people and help establish the sovereignty of the Arab people."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 20th: The latest issue of the Indian weekly "New Age" expressed deep regret over the attitude taken by UAR President Nasser towards the Republic of Iraq. The newspaper pointed out: "The anti-communist stick that Nasser is trying to use to force Iraq to unite with the UAR will only backfire on himself."

The newspaper said that Nasser's slander of communism only exposed the reactionary nature of his position towards the Republic of Iraq, regardless of whether this approach was inspired by Yugoslav President Tito or someone else.

"New Age" welcomed the Iraqi government's victory in suppressing the Shawwaf rebellion. The newspaper pointed out that this rebellion clearly showed that "imperialist forces are still counting on reactionary forces within Arab countries to overthrow the Republic of Iraq and re-establish the old order there." The newspaper pointed out that the Mosul rebellion was "a conspiracy planned from the outside and carried out by domestic reactionaries."

The newspaper said, "If what Nasser calls 'loyalty' to the United Arab Republic and Arab nationalism means forcing Arab countries to merge with the UAR and having him as president, then no nationalist in any Asian or African country will support him."

### 印度报纸继续发表评论  伊拉克的斗争获得亚非舆论支持

    印度报纸继续发表评论
    伊拉克的斗争获得亚非舆论支持
    新华社新德里19日电　印度报纸继续发表评论，指责阿联总统纳赛尔对伊拉克和它的政府领导人进行的攻击。
    “甘露市场报”18日指出，唯一对阿联当局这次公开反对伊拉克的活动而引起的局势感到舒服的，“是帝国主义者，而阿拉伯人民是决心从帝国主义者的统治下解放自己的。”
    这家报纸说，“无可否认，伊拉克的7月革命，正如赫鲁晓夫所说的，取得一切进步力量的支持。”它又说，纳赛尔目前的态度是由于“伊拉克拒绝同阿联联合”。
    孟加拉文日报“欢喜市场报”18日的社论说，“那些对西亚阿拉伯民族主义的增强感到高兴的人，现在对这两个国家和它们领袖之间的分裂非常不安。”
    这家报纸说，但是，纳赛尔和西方国家之间已经达成了某种谅解。西方国家仍然反对伊拉克政府，这是因为伊拉克政府反对巴格达条约和最近美国在安卡拉同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定。
    “自由报”18日在它发表的长篇社论中说，“纳赛尔除了对阿拉伯共产党人和阿拉伯民族主义者之间的团结——这种团结为反帝而奋斗和支持民族独立发展——进行打击外，他已经动手在民族主义者中间制造分裂和不团结。”
    这家报纸说，通过利用盲目反共和中世纪宗教狂热的这种武器，“帝国主义者一再企图分裂阿拉伯的团结，在过去，纳赛尔自己也不得不对付这种局面。纳赛尔如何能够忘记这一点？即使纳赛尔的记忆力由于朗特里、铁托、布莱克和其他人的访问所产生的某些作用而变得迟钝，亚非世界的人民，阿拉伯国家的人民，甚至是叙利亚和埃及的人民却不能忘记这一切。”
    这家报纸说，对帝国主义阴谋的抵抗决不能发生分裂。
    这家报纸指责纳赛尔干涉伊拉克内政的行动，它说，“伊拉克的决心将获得整个亚非世界舆论的支持。”
    这家报纸最后说，“我们必须支持阿拉伯人民，帮助建立阿拉伯人民的主权。”
    “印度时报”最近发表社论说，“努里·赛义德政权曾经使用过纳赛尔总统现在用来诋毁卡塞姆政府的同样的手法；这种手法今天是否将比过去更有效是值得怀疑的。”
    这家报纸警告说，“对卡塞姆准将的这种漫无节制的攻击只能使阿拉伯人怀疑，开罗是否真想拥护阿拉伯团结。”
    新华社新德里20日电　印度最近一期的“新世纪”周报对于阿联总统纳赛尔对伊拉克共和国所采取的态度表示深深遗憾。报纸指出：“纳赛尔企图用来驱使伊拉克同阿联联合的反共棒棍只会反打到自己身上”。
    这家报纸说，纳赛尔对共产主义进行谩骂，这只暴露了他对伊拉克共和国所采取的立场的反动性，无论他这种做法是从南斯拉夫的铁托总统或其他什么人那里得到灵感的。
    “新世纪”周报欢迎伊拉克政府镇压沙瓦夫叛乱所取得的胜利。报纸指出，这次叛乱清楚地表明，“帝国主义势力仍然在指望阿拉伯国家内部的反动势力来推翻伊拉克共和国，并且重新在那里建立旧秩序”。报纸指出，摩苏尔叛乱是“由外面策划而通过国内反动派来实行的阴谋。”
    报纸说，“如果纳赛尔所说的‘忠于’阿拉伯联合共和国和阿拉伯民族主义就意味着强迫阿拉伯各国同阿联合并，而由他来担任总统的话，那末任何亚非国家的民族主义者都不会支持他”。
