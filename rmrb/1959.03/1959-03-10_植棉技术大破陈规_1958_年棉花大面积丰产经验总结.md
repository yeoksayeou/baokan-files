Breaking Conventions in Cotton Planting Technology
Summary of Large-Scale Cotton Bumper Harvest Experiences in 1958
First Division, Economic Crop Production Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

In 1958, China achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton. The total national cotton production doubled compared to 1957, and many high-yield fields emerged, with cotton fields yielding over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu accounting for about four-tenths of the total cotton field area nationwide. The experience of the 1958 cotton bumper harvest is extremely rich. Now, we will introduce some of the main experiences in six aspects: soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, and management.

	Cotton Fields Also Need Deep Plowing

Cotton is a deep-rooted crop. In deeply plowed cotton fields, the main roots of cotton plants penetrate deeply, and the lateral roots are widely distributed, expanding the area for absorbing nutrients and water. The cotton plants grow robustly, producing more bolls, and the cotton bolls are heavier, thus increasing the yield.

In the past, it was believed that deep plowing of cotton fields should not exceed thirty centimeters and that the cultivated layer should not be increased too much at once. The experiences of 1958 have broken these conservative notions. According to the experimental results of the Hengshui Agricultural Science Institute in Hebei Province on four types of land with deep plowing depths of one chi, one and a half chi, two chi, and three chi, taking the yield of 451.3 jin per mu for plowing one chi deep as the baseline, deep plowing to one and a half chi increased yield by 5.5%; deep plowing to two chi increased yield by 11.1%; deep plowing to three chi increased yield by 25.7%. Facts prove that deep plowing to three chi at once results in even higher yield increases.

Deep plowing of cotton fields should be carried out in autumn and winter. If there is not enough time for plowing in winter, spring plowing can also be carried out in early spring. Spring plowing must be carried out as early as possible after the soil thaws, and harrowing should be done immediately after plowing to preserve soil moisture. When deep plowing, pay attention not to disrupt the soil layers. For deep plowing exceeding two chi, the land must be irrigated with "trampling water" after plowing to ensure close contact between soil layers and increase soil moisture content.

In areas where wheat and cotton are grown in double cropping, in order to overcome the disadvantage of cotton fields intercropped with wheat not being able to be deeply plowed, a method of deep digging in the wheat rows can be adopted, which is beneficial to both cotton and wheat production. According to a survey by the Fenghuang Cooperative in Jingxi Township, Jiangling County, Hubei Province, cotton yields increased by 23% when digging one chi deep in wheat rows compared to shallow digging of three cun.

	More Fertilizer Won't Cause Excessive Growth

In the past, it was believed that applying too much fertilizer to cotton fields would cause cotton to reduce yield due to excessive growth, so people were afraid to apply too much fertilizer. The cotton bumper harvest experience of 1958 proves that increasing fertilizer application, in coordination with correct agricultural techniques, will not only prevent excessive growth but is also a necessary material foundation for increasing cotton production. In 1958, the application of base fertilizer to cotton fields increased significantly, generally applying over 10,000 jin of organic fertilizer per mu, and in some cases, as much as over 50,000 jin. At the same time, the frequency and quantity of topdressing were increased. This is an important condition for promoting robust growth of cotton plants, producing many large peaches (bolls), and achieving large-scale bumper harvests.

The correct fertilization technique for cotton fields is to first apply sufficient base fertilizer in layers (more in the upper layer and less in the lower layer) on the basis of deep plowing and deep turning, and to mix the fertilizer and soil evenly to create deep, fertile soil. In addition, during the cotton growth period, different types and quantities of topdressing should be applied at different times according to the needs of the cotton plants. The 1958 bumper harvest experience proves that fertilization of cotton fields must be based on base fertilizer, supplemented by topdressing. Regarding the timing of topdressing, it was previously believed that no more topdressing should be applied after mid-July, otherwise, it would cause late maturity and reduced yield. However, last year's experience proves that not only should attention be paid to topdressing during the seedling and flowering stages, but also during the boll-opening stage. Many areas last year appropriately applied autumn peach fertilizer, which not only did not cause excessive growth and late maturity, but also played a significant role in striving for more autumn peaches and increasing boll weight.

From the 1958 fertilization experience, the importance of appropriate coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers is further seen. With the increase in cotton field yield requirements and the increase in nitrogen fertilizer, the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers must be increased accordingly. According to the survey results of the Cotton Research Institute of Hebei Province in Handan on nineteen high-yield cotton fields, all fertilizer applications paid attention to the coordination of the three elements, with the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers being approximately 1:1:1. Cotton field fertilization is not simply about quantity, but also about appropriateness. Many bumper harvest experiences in 1958 prove that applying about 40 jin of pure nitrogen per mu, supplemented with corresponding phosphorus, potassium, and other fertilizers, can obtain a yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton. Rational fertilization can not only give full play to the role of fertilizer but is also a very important key to solving the problem of bud and boll shedding. The experience gained in this regard in 1958 is: on the basis of applying sufficient base fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer should be controlled and less applied during the seedling stage, and more phosphorus fertilizer should be applied; after the cotton plants in the flowering stage begin to set peaches (bolls) in the lower part, nitrogen topdressing should be applied in stages and in large quantities; after boll setting, appropriate amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus should be supplemented as "peach fertilizer" as needed. This can make the cotton seedlings grow steadily without excessive growth, with compact internodes, early peach setting, sufficient fertilizer for vegetative growth in the middle stage, and no fertilizer deficiency when the bolls are set and mature in the later stage. This can effectively reduce the shedding of buds and bolls, not only producing more summer peaches (bolls) but also producing more autumn peaches (bolls), significantly increasing the yield.

	Rational Water Use Has Many Benefits

In cotton areas with early seasons, winter irrigation of cotton fields is very important to ensure that the soil has enough moisture when sowing cotton. Cotton fields that have not been winter-irrigated can be spring-irrigated. However, spring irrigation must be carried out as early as possible and not too late to avoid lowering the soil temperature and affecting timely sowing. Whether it is spring or winter irrigation, attention should be paid to harrowing to preserve soil moisture.

Like fertilizer, water must be used rationally to give full play to its role. According to the experience gained in 1958 regarding irrigation techniques during the cotton growth period, on the basis of winter or spring irrigation, seedling irrigation before the cotton blooms should be appropriately postponed. If watering is done too early at this stage, it will affect the downward development of the cotton plant's root system, the cotton seedlings will grow too fast, the internodes will be long, and the shedding of lower buds and bolls will increase. When starting the first irrigation, the method of irrigating every other furrow should generally be adopted to reduce the amount of irrigation. After the cotton plants start to bloom, the number of irrigations and the amount of irrigation should be gradually increased. After entering the flowering stage, cotton needs the most moisture, and it is necessary to ensure timely supply of sufficient moisture. In the past, cotton was no longer watered after it began to open its bolls, because it was believed that watering in the later stage would cause the cotton plants to grow excessively and mature late. In 1958, this convention was also broken, and many cotton areas created successful experiences in appropriately supplementing moisture in the later stage as needed and achieving increased production. Of course, if watering is done too much and too late in the later stage, it will also delay boll opening and increase boll rot, which should be avoided. The method of irrigation is generally better to use the method of light furrow irrigation, which can facilitate the control of the amount of irrigation and reduce soil compaction.

	Good Varieties Play a Significant Role in Increasing Production

Under the conditions of deep plowing, increased fertilization, water conservancy, and improved cultivation and management techniques, good cotton varieties have further played a role in increasing production. Judging from the high-yield examples created in various places, the existing good cotton varieties can still greatly increase yield after adopting advanced cultivation techniques. This breaks the conservative view that a certain variety can only have a certain productivity, and that the number of fruiting branches and cotton bolls that can be formed on each cotton plant has a certain limit.

In 1958, many regions implemented the policy of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use" for cotton seeds, which played a very good role in improving the quality of cotton seeds. On the basis of the participation of the masses and scientific research institutions in seed selection, some new excellent varieties have emerged that meet current production needs and cultivation conditions. For example, "Duotao Cotton," selected by the masses in Linzhang County, Hebei Province, and "Furong Cotton," selected by the Furong Farm in Pengze, Jiangxi Province, are both new varieties suitable for close planting; "Datao Cotton," selected by the masses in Linqing County, Shandong Province, has bolls twice as heavy as those of general good varieties, and only fifty cotton bolls are needed to harvest one jin of seed cotton. These new varieties, after further cultivation and breeding, will be able to play a greater role in production.

	Close Planting Requires Appropriate Spacing Between Plants and Rows

Promoting rational close planting is an important measure for the cotton leap forward and increased production in 1958.

The yield-increasing effect of rational close planting is mainly manifested in the significant increase in the total number of bolls formed per mu. However, a certain variety, under certain cultivation conditions, also has a certain range for rational close planting. If the density is too high, it will cause bud and boll shedding and rotting due to the closure of the cotton field, and the total number of bolls formed will decrease instead. Therefore, cotton close planting is not necessarily more productive the denser it is.

Ensuring that there are more plants in the cotton field while minimizing the impact of cotton field closure is the key to increasing production through close planting. To solve this problem, in addition to strengthening comprehensive technical measures and appropriately controlling water and fertilizer to make the cotton plants develop compactly and avoid excessive growth, improving planting methods and appropriately configuring row and plant spacing is also a major approach. In this regard, a lot of experience was also gained in 1958. For example, according to the experience of Daxinzhuang in Linqing County, Shandong Province, the same density of 4,444 plants per mu had different effects due to different row and plant spacing. Their practice proves that appropriate widening of row spacing and reducing plant spacing is conducive to light and ventilation in the cotton field, facilitating operation and management, and reducing shedding and boll rot. The yield of row spacing of two chi increased by 8.6% compared with row spacing of one chi and eight cun, and increased by 18% compared with row spacing of one chi and five cun. Some areas implement intercropping of cotton and dwarf crops, which is also a good way to solve the shading of cotton fields and reduce bud and boll shedding. In Gansu, Liaoning, and other places, high yields have been achieved by adopting wide-row double-plant close planting. In cotton fields with mechanized cultivation in Xinjiang, the method of square-hole sowing has also been successfully experienced.

	More Mid-Cultivation and Late Topping

Cotton is a mid-cultivation crop. The 1958 cotton bumper harvest experience proves that early mid-cultivation, more mid-cultivation, deep mid-cultivation, and strengthening late mid-cultivation, eliminating soil compaction in cotton fields at any time, and thoroughly removing weeds in cotton fields are measures that play a major role in increasing cotton production. The masses have the following understanding of mid-cultivation: "Early mid-cultivation warms the soil; more mid-cultivation prevents soil compaction; deep mid-cultivation resists both waterlogging and drought." In the past, cotton mid-cultivation generally started only during thinning and setting seedlings and stopped when the cotton plants closed the rows. In 1958, many cotton areas started "weeding dream flowers" when the cotton seedlings began to emerge and the cotton rows could be distinguished, and continued late mid-cultivation after the cotton plants closed the rows, which is very necessary for striving for high-yield harvests. After the cotton plants close the rows, in order to reduce the closure of the cotton field and facilitate field management, many areas have promoted the technology of pushing plants and merging ridges, which has achieved certain results.

Another important task in cotton field management is pruning. Cotton pruning is an important measure to regulate cotton plant nutrients, protect bolls, promote early maturity, and improve yield and quality. In the past, cotton pruning generally topped early in mid-to-late July; when pruning fruit branch tips, only three or four fruit nodes were left on each fruit branch. In 1958, new developments were made in cotton pruning technology, breaking through the old scope. Most areas appropriately delayed the topping time according to changes in cotton field production conditions, generally waiting until August to calculate the effective growth period based on the frost period for topping. Experience proves that this can make full use of the growing season and strive to produce more autumn peaches (bolls), which is an important technological innovation. Regarding pruning fruit branch tips, many areas have also changed to the method of pruning less and leaving more fruit nodes or not pruning at all, depending on the conditions, which has also proven to be the correct approach under the new production conditions. Many cotton fields, under the conditions of high fertility, sufficient water, and increased density, have strengthened pruning work such as removing large leaves and cutting empty branches, which has achieved certain results in reducing cotton field shading and overcoming boll shedding and rotting. Some high-yield experimental fields have implemented management measures such as artificial assisted pollination, clipping corollas before rain, and picking off withered flowers after rain in cotton field management work, which also has a certain effect on increasing the maturity rate.

    植棉技术大破陈规
    1958年棉花大面积丰产经验总结
    农业部经济作物生产局第一处
    1958年我国棉花获得空前大丰收。全国棉花总产量比1957年增加了一倍，并出现许多高额丰产田，单产达到一百斤皮棉以上的棉田约占全国棉田总面积的十分之四左右。1958年棉花丰产的经验是极其丰富的，现就土、肥、水、种、密、管六方面介绍一些主要的经验。
        棉田也要深耕
    棉花是深根作物。深耕的棉田，棉花主根扎得深，侧根分布广，吸收肥分和水分的面扩大，棉株生长健壮，结铃多，棉铃重，因而产量也就增加。
    过去认为棉田深耕不宜超过三十厘米，而且不能一次增加耕层太多。1958年的经验已经打破了这些保守的观念。根据河北省衡水农业科学研究所对深翻一尺、一尺五寸、二尺、三尺四种土地的试验结果，以耕一尺深的亩产四百五十一点三斤为基数，深翻一尺五寸的增产5.5％；深翻二尺的增产11.1％；深翻三尺的增产25.7％。事实证明，一次深翻到三尺，产量增加的更高。
    棉田深耕应该在秋冬进行。如果冬季来不及耕翻的，也可在早春进行春耕。春季耕翻必须在土壤开冻后及早进行，耕后随即耙耱保墒。深翻时要注意不打乱土层。深翻在二尺以上的，翻地后必须灌一次“蹋地水”，使土层密接，并增加土壤含水量。
    麦棉两熟栽培的地区，为了克服麦棉间作棉田不能深耕的缺点，可以采取在麦行里深挖的办法，对棉麦增产都有作用。据湖北江陵县荆西乡凤凰社的调查，麦行里深挖一尺的，比浅挖三寸的棉花产量增加23％。
        肥多不会疯长
    过去认为棉田施肥多了，棉花就会由于疯长而减产，因而不敢多施肥。1958年的棉花丰产经验证明，增施肥料，在正确的农业技术配合下，非但不会造成疯长，而且是棉花增产必要的物质基础。1958年棉田施用基肥大量增加，一般每亩施有机肥料一万斤以上，多的达五万多斤，同时增加了追肥的次数和数量。这是促使棉株健壮生长，桃多桃大，实现大面积丰产的重要条件。
    棉田正确的施肥技术，首先要在深耕深翻的基础上，分层施足基肥（上层多些，下层少些），并使肥料和土壤均匀混合，创造深厚的肥沃土壤。另外，在棉花生育期间，还要根据棉株不同时期的需要，分次增施不同种类不同数量的追肥。1958年的丰产经验证明：棉田施肥必须以基肥为主，追肥为辅。对于追肥的时间，过去认为7月中旬以后就不能再追肥，否则就会造成晚熟减产。但是去年的经验证明，不但苗期、开花期应该注意追肥，就是到了吐絮后也同样需要追肥。许多地区去年适当追施了秋桃肥，不但没有引起徒长晚熟，而且对争取多结秋桃，增加铃重，起了显著的作用。
    从1958年的施肥经验中，进一步看出了氮磷钾肥料适当配合的重要。随着棉田产量要求的提高，氮素肥料的增加，必须相应地增加磷、钾肥料的配合施用。根据河北省棉花研究所在邯郸对十九块丰产棉田的调查结果，施用肥料都注意了三要素的配合，氮、磷、钾三种肥料的比例约为1∶1∶1。棉田施肥不单纯在多，而且要得当。1958年的许多丰产经验证明，每亩施用纯氮量四十斤左右，配合相应的磷、钾等肥料，即可获得千斤籽棉的产量。合理施肥，不仅可以充分发挥肥料的作用，而且对于解决蕾铃脱落问题，是很重要的关键。1958年在这方面取得的经验是：在施足基肥的基础上，苗期应控制少追氮肥，增施磷肥；开花期棉株下部开始坐桃后，再分期多施氮素追肥；结铃后，并根据需要补充适量的氮、磷作“桃肥”。这样，可以使棉苗发的稳，不猛长，节间紧凑，早坐桃，中期发棵有充分的肥料，后期结铃成熟时也不脱肥。从而有效地减少蕾铃的脱落，不仅多结伏桃，而且还多结秋桃，产量显著增加。
      合理用水好处多
    季节早的棉区，为了使棉花播种时土壤有足够的水分，棉田冬灌颇为重要。冬季没有冬灌的棉田，可以进行春灌。但春灌必须及早进行，不能过晚，以免降低棉田地温，影响适时播种。无论春灌或冬灌后，都要注意做好耙耱保墒工作。
    水和肥一样，有了水还必须合理利用，才能充分发挥作用。棉花生长期间的灌溉技术，根据1958年取得的经验，在进行了冬灌或春灌的基础上，应该适当推迟棉花现蕾前的苗期灌溉。如果这一阶段灌水过早，会影响棉株根系的向下发展，棉苗长得过快，节间长，增加下部蕾铃的脱落。开始第一次灌溉时，一般应采取隔沟灌的办法，减少灌水量。棉花现蕾以后，要逐步增加灌水次数和灌水量。进入开花期以后，棉花需要水分最多，必须保证及时供应充分的水分。过去棉花开始吐絮以后就不再灌水，认为后期灌了水就会使棉株疯长、晚熟。1958年也突破了这一陈规，许多棉区都创造了后期根据需要适当补充水分而取得增产成效的成功经验。当然，后期灌水如果灌得太多太晚，也会延迟吐絮，增加烂铃，这是应该避免的。灌溉的方法，一般以开沟轻灌的方法较好，可以便于控制灌水量，减少田面的板结。
      良种增产作用显著
    在深耕、增肥、水利化、提高栽培管理技术的条件下，棉花良种也进一步发挥了增产的作用。从各地创造的高额丰产事例来看，现有的棉花良种，采用先进的栽培技术后，产量还可极大地提高。这就打破了过去认为一定品种只能有一定的生产力，每株棉棵上能利用的果枝数和能结成的棉铃数都有一定限额的保守观点。
    1958年许多地区对棉种贯彻了“自繁、自选、自留、自用”的方针，对提高棉种的质量，起了很好的作用。在广大群众和科学研究机关参加选种的基础上，已出现了一些新的适应当前生产需要和栽培条件的优良品种。如河北省临漳县群众选育出的“多桃棉”，江西彭泽芙蓉农场选育出的“芙蓉棉”，都是适合密植的新品种；山东临清县群众选育出的“大桃棉”，铃重比一般良种大一倍，只要五十个棉桃就可收一斤籽棉。这些新品种，经过进一步培育繁殖后，将能在生产上发挥更大的作用。
  密植要适当配置株距行距
    推行合理密植是1958年棉花跃进增产的一项重要措施。
    合理密植的增产作用，主要表现在每亩总成铃数的显著增加。但一定品种，在一定栽培条件下，合理密植也有一定的范围。如果密度过大，就会因棉田郁闭而引起蕾铃脱落和霉烂，总成铃数反而减少。因而棉花密植也不是愈密愈增产的。
    既要保证棉田有较多的株数，又要尽量减少棉田郁闭的影响，这是密植增产的关键问题。解决这一问题，除加强综合性的技术措施，适当控制水、肥，使棉株紧凑发育避免生长过盛外；改进种植方式，适当配置行株距也是一个主要的途径。1958年在这方面也取得了不少的经验。如山东临清县大新庄的经验，同样每亩四千四百四十四株的密度，但是由于行株距不同，效果两样。它们的实践证明，适当放宽行距缩小株距的排列，利于棉田透光通风，操作管理方便，脱落和烂铃减少。行距二尺的较行距一尺八寸的增产8.6％，较行距一尺五寸的增产18％。有些地区实行棉花和矮生作物间作，也是解决棉田荫蔽减少蕾铃脱落的很好方法。在甘肃、辽宁等地，有采用宽行双株密植而取得高产的。在新疆实行机械化耕作的棉田，采用方形穴播法，也取得成功的经验。
        多中耕晚打顶
    棉花是中耕作物，1958年棉花丰产经验证明，早中耕、多中耕、深中耕并加强后期中耕，随时消灭棉田板结，彻底清除棉田杂草，对棉花增产是起重大作用的措施。广大群众对中耕的体会是：“早中耕，地发暖；多中耕，地不板；深中耕，抗涝又抗旱”。过去棉田中耕，一般是间苗定苗时才开始，棉花封行时即停止。1958年许多棉区在棉苗开始出土能辨出棉行时，即开始“锄梦花”，棉花封行以后还继续进行后期中耕，这对争取高额丰产是很必要的。棉花封行后，为了减少棉田郁闭，便于进行田间管理，许多地区推行了推株并垅的技术，收到一定的效果。
    棉田管理的另一重要工作是整枝。棉花整枝是调节棉株养分，保铃，促进早熟，提高产量和品质的重要措施。过去棉花整枝一般在7月中下旬，就早打顶；打果枝尖的时候，每一果枝上只留三、四个果节。1958年在棉花整枝技术上，突破了旧的范畴，有许多新的发展。大部地区根据棉田生产条件的改变，适当延迟打顶的时间，一般到8月里才根据霜期推算有效的生育时期来进行打顶。经验证明，这样可以充分利用生长期，争取多结秋桃，是一个重要的技术革新。对于打果枝尖，许多地区也根据条件改为少打多留果节或完全不打的办法，证明也是在新的生产条件下的正确做法。许多棉田在肥大、水足、密度增大的条件下，加强了打大叶、剪空枝等整枝工作，对减少棉田荫蔽，克服棉铃脱落和霉烂现象，收到了一定的效果。部分高产试验田，在棉田管理工作中实行了人工辅助授粉，雨前夹花冠，雨后摘败花等管理措施，这对增加成熟率，也有一定的作用。
