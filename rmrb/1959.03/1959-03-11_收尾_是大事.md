    “Finishing Touches” are Important
    Chu Xue
    In capital construction, it is necessary to appropriately concentrate resources from all aspects to focus on completing the finishing work of those newly built and expanded key enterprises.
    When handling affairs, one should pay attention to "starting well and ending well." While striving to avoid "failure for want of a final effort," "protracted delays" are also not a good phenomenon. People often oppose being a "paper tiger," meaning that the beginning should be good, and the ending should be complete. This is a principle that everyone understands.
    Grasping finishing work is not just a matter of "ending well." Because the completion of finishing work marks the start of production for new factories and mines. Only when the finishing work can "end well"—be completed on time with good quality—can the new factories and mines "start well"—be put into production on time and fulfill the state's production plans.
    From this point of view, grasping finishing work is not an insignificant "cleanup," but a matter related to better fulfilling the state plan. Currently, many capital construction projects across the country have reached the finishing stage. They will be the new force on the industrial front, and a considerable part of this year's plan for a greater leap forward in industry awaits them to complete. Most of these finishing projects do not require much effort; with just a small additional investment of manpower and materials, they can be put into production immediately. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate to concentrate the necessary resources to build these new factories and mines quickly and well, so that they can play their role as soon as possible.
    The problem lies in how one views finishing work ideologically. Because finishing work is relatively fragmented, with a small workload and low output value, it seems that there is not much "profit" for construction enterprises. However, if one does not consider the small picture, but calculates the big picture, the "profit" is very large. As long as such a small workload is completed, steel mills can immediately produce molten iron and sparks of steel, rolling mills can immediately roll out various steel products, and coal mines can immediately increase the production of "black gold"... Don't we often say that every second counts, time is steel, time is coal? Letting these new factories and mines go into production one day, ten days earlier can create so much more value for the country! The manufacturing of machinery and equipment is also the same. Finishing work often does not require major equipment, but only some non-standard equipment. This equipment may not play a decisive role in mechanical factories completing their output value plans, but without this equipment, the main equipment of the new factories and mines still cannot be started. Everything is ready, only a few pieces of non-standard equipment are missing, and the new factories and mines still cannot be put into production.
    The key here is: the construction industry and mechanical factories must view finishing work with the spirit of "the whole country as one chess game." As long as they do not haggle over the small gains of their own units, but calculate the big gains of the country's high-speed development of production, they will attach importance to the finishing work of those newly built and expanded key enterprises, and actively ensure that the finishing work is completed quickly and well.
    In the past years, all localities have generally paid attention to grasping finishing work. This year, in order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, it is necessary to sort out capital construction projects according to the spirit of "the whole country as one chess game"; in the sorting, the finishing projects that are urgently needed for this year's production should be placed at the forefront. While accelerating the construction of new key projects, the Beijing Industrial Capital Construction Department has concentrated the necessary resources to focus on the finishing work of eighteen factories. This can enable these enterprises to quickly play their role, and also enable the construction forces invested in finishing work to be drawn out early to support other key projects. This is a good move!

### “收尾”是大事

    “收尾”是大事
    楚雪
    在基本建设中，需要适当地集中各方面的力量，突击完成那些新建扩建的重点企业的收尾工程。
    办事情，要讲究“善始善终”。“功亏一篑”固然要力求避免，“旷日持久”也不是好现象。人们常常反对“虎头蛇尾”，意思就是既要开头开得好，又要结尾结得完满。这是一般人都懂的道理。
    抓收尾工程还不仅仅是个“善终”的问题。因为收尾工程的完成，也就是新厂矿生产的开始。只有收尾工程能“善终”——按时交工，质量良好，新厂矿才能“善始”——按时投入生产，完成国家规定的生产计划。
    从这样的观点来看，抓收尾工程就不是无足轻重的“扫尾”，而是关系到更好地完成国家计划的问题。现在，全国有许多基本建设工程已经到了收尾的阶段。它们将是工业战线上的生力军，今年工业上更大跃进的计划有相当大的部分等待着它们去完成。这些收尾工程多数是不用花很大力气，只要再投入少量的人力、物力，就可以马上投入生产的。因此集中必要的力量，把这些新厂矿又快又好地建设起来，让它们早日发挥作用，是完全应该的。
    问题在于思想上如何看收尾工程。由于收尾工程比较零碎，工作量小，产值不大，对于建筑企业来说，好像“油水”不大。可是如果不算小账，而算算大账，“油水”就大得很了。只要完成这样小小的工作量，钢铁厂马上就能流出铁水，飞起钢花，轧钢厂马上就能轧出各种钢材，煤井马上就能增产“乌金”……。我们不是常说，分秒必争，时间就是钢、时间就是煤吗？让这些新厂矿早投入生产一天、十天，能为国家多创造多大的价值啊！机器设备的制造也是如此。收尾工程往往并不需要多么重大的设备，而是只需要一些非标准设备。这些设备，对于机械工厂完成产值计划也许不起决定性作用，可是，没有这些设备，新厂矿的主要设备还是开动不起来。万事俱备，只欠几样非标准设备，新厂矿仍然不能投入生产。
    这里的关键是：建筑业、机械厂要用“全国一盘棋”的精神来看待收尾工程。只要不去斤斤计较本单位的小账，而是算全国高速度发展生产的大账，就会重视那些新建扩建的重点企业的收尾工程，积极去保证收尾工程又快又好地完成。
    历年来，各地一般都注意抓紧了收尾工程。今年为了实现更大更好更全面的跃进，要根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，对基本建设项目进行排队；排队中，要把那些重要的今年生产迫切需要的收尾工程排在前头。北京工业基本建设部门在加速建设新的重点工程的同时，集中了必要的力量，突击十八个工厂的收尾工程。既能使这些企业迅速发挥作用，又可以使投入收尾工程上的施工力量早日抽调出来支援其他重点工程，这是一着好棋！
