Unveiling Soil Secrets: Do a Good Job in Soil Survey
Feng Zhaolin, Institute of Soil and Fertilizer, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

The current stage of soil survey mainly focuses on agricultural soils. The main method of the survey is to summarize the characteristics exhibited by the soil during cultivation. The purpose of the survey is to elevate the experience of farmers in improving and utilizing soil to a theoretical level, so as to guide current agricultural production and rapidly establish and develop China's soil science.

	Characteristics of Agricultural Soil
Since the object of the survey is agricultural soil, the survey should pay attention to the difference between agricultural soil and "natural soil." The main characteristic of agricultural soil is its tillability. The main characteristics of agricultural soil are: the thickness of the cultivated layer varies under different cultivation, fertilization and improvement measures, the soil fertility is uneven, and the soil permeability is inconsistent. In a certain area, these characteristics generally reflect the intensity of cultivation and management, and are only affected to a small extent by so-called "soil-forming factors." Therefore, it is not convenient to use the "soil-forming factors" of "natural soil" to explain the occurrence and formation of agricultural soil during the survey and identification. Therefore, it is difficult to describe agricultural soil well using the terminology for describing "natural soil." This is because many characteristics of agricultural soil are not static, but change with the seasons and with the situation of utilization and improvement, which can become better or worse quickly. The structure and structure of the cultivated layer are the most obvious examples. Soil surveys in Guangdong have proven that the structure, structure and ripening of the cultivated layer of some soils change greatly within three months. Due to human labor and conscious transformation, the soil can become very good in a short period of time, and the fertility can be improved quickly. This characteristic is not found in "natural soil."

	The Scientific Value of Farmers' Soil Terminology
Guangdong's soil survey has achieved brilliant results. Guangdong farmers divide the soil into 133 types, which are merged into 30 soil areas, belonging to 7 land categories. Among these 133 types of soil, except for a part that is "natural soil," most of them are formed under different cultivation, fertilization, and improvement measures. This just shows the richness of farmers' soil knowledge. The terms used in the past to describe soil profiles, such as color, texture, structure, moisture, parent material, etc., more or less "staticized" the characteristics of the profile, and therefore could not effectively complete the task of describing agricultural soil. Experienced farmers don't do this. Farmers in Gaoyao Prefecture, Guangdong, call the best kind of paddy field "Ni Rou Tian". "Rou" means fertile, and "Ni" means suitable tillability and good structure. Therefore, when "Ni Rou Tian" is mentioned, farmers praise it endlessly. At the same time, when "Ni Rou Tian" is mentioned, farmers also know its shortcomings, such as making rice easy to lodge and needing drainage. Farmers call a kind of field with poor tillability and poor structure "Leng Fan Tian" (Cold Rice Field). It is conceivable what kind of image this is. It's like a cold rice dumpling soaked in cold water, the water and rice are not soluble, and it will hurt your stomach to "eat" it. When this kind of field is mentioned, farmers know that it is a low-grade field, and the improvement measures are to add grass ash, rice husks, and green manure to turn "cold rice" into "Ni Rou". If we don't use farmers' terms but use so-called "scientific" terms, then both types of fields can be called "clay". Because according to mechanical analysis, the clay particles of these two soils are more than 80%. This name cannot express the real difference between the two in terms of tillability and fertility. Therefore, in the soil survey and identification work, we must use farmers' common terms to replace "scientific" terms, and use farmers' terms as the unit for making large-scale soil maps, so as to improve China's soil science a step further.

	The Key Lies in Increasing Soil Organic Matter
Applying a large amount of organic matter fertilizer to improve the long-term damp subsoil, that is, applying a large amount of unfermented, semi-fermented and fermented organic fertilizer is a good way to improve all the surveyed soils, and is a major discovery in this soil survey. From the high-yield examples of late rice in Guangdong in 1958, it can be seen that the high-yield fields all used a large amount of organic matter such as cattle manure, old wall soil, grass ash and green manure, and chemical fertilizers were used very little. This fact points out that China's future cropping system must take increasing soil organic matter as the guiding principle.

The two most practical principles in soil science have been applied to deep plowing and soil improvement, and at the same time, deep plowing and soil improvement have further proved the truth of these two principles. One is the decisive role of soil organic matter in soil tillability, and the other is the decisive role of soil aerobic conditions (a property of soil, there are aerobic and anaerobic types, aerobic means liking air) for the existence and absorption of soil nutrients. In the process of deep plowing and soil improvement, applying a large amount of organic fertilizer and other fertilizers, combined with sand and mud, expands the aerobic soil space, which plays an important role in increasing yield.

	Summarize Farmers' Experience
In the soil survey and identification work, it is also necessary to universally summarize farmers' whole set of experience in managing and improving soil. Guangdong's survey work has proved that farmers' inherent experience and the experience created in the Great Leap Forward have not only enriched soil science, but also put forward a series of research topics for soil science. "Field Archives" is one of them. "Field Archives" is to systematically record all the changes in the soil from deep plowing and soil improvement. The accumulation of these data further points out the direction of the occurrence and formation of agricultural soil, and can point out the principles of cultivation, fertilization and management for large-area high-yield.

Guangdong's soil survey and identification have played a good role in soil science research and production practice. Different soils are given different deep plowing and soil improvement measures according to the instructions of identification, which guides agricultural production. It provides a theoretical basis for valuable experiences such as layered fertilization, soil ripening, plowing in winter and drying in the sun (Guangdong farmers plow and dry the soil in winter to make the soil weathered, loose and brittle, which is easy to cultivate and can increase production in the second year), burning soil and fumigating soil. It provides scientific argumentation for the necessity of applying a large amount of organic fertilizer, cultivating the garden field and the "three-three system".

    揭开土壤秘密　作好土壤普查
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所　冯兆林
    现阶段土壤普查的对象主要是农业土壤。普查的方法主要是在耕作栽培过程中总结土壤所表现的特性。普查的目的是把农民群众改良利用土壤的经验提高到理论上来，以指导当前农业生产，并迅速建立和发展我国的土壤科学。
        农业土壤的特性
    普查的对象既然是农业土壤，普查时就要注意到农业土壤与“自然土壤”之间的区别。农业土壤的主要特征是它的耕性。农业土壤主要的特征是：在不同耕作施肥改良的措施下耕作层的厚薄不一致，土壤肥力不一，土壤透性不一。在一定地区内，这些特征一般是反映了耕作的强度和管理的情况，只是在很小程度上受所谓“成土因素”的影响。所以在普查鉴定时，不便利用“自然土壤”的“成土因素”来说明农业土壤的发生和形成。因此用描述“自然土壤”的那套术语来描述农业土壤，很难作到好处。这是因为农业土壤的许多特性不是静止的，而是随着季节，随着利用改良的情况而变化，可以变好，也可以很快变坏的。耕层的结构和结构性就是最明显的例子。广东的土壤普查证明，在某些土壤中，在三个月的时间内土壤的结构，结构性和耕作层的熟化的变化就很大。由于人的劳动和有意识的改造，土壤可以在很短的时间内变得很好，肥力很快提高，这一特征是“自然土壤”所没有的。
    农民的土壤术语的科学价值
    广东省的土壤普查取得了辉煌的成绩。广东农民把土壤分为一百三十三种，归并为三十个土区，属于七个地类。在这一百三十三种土壤里除去一部分是“自然土壤”外，大部分是在不同的耕作施肥和改良的措施下形成的。这正说明农民土壤知识的丰富。以往所用的描述土壤剖面的术语，如颜色，质地，结构，水分，母质等，是或多或少地把剖面的特征“静止化”了，因而不能有效地完成描述农业土壤的任务。有经验的农民就不这样，广东的高要专区农民把最好的一种稻田叫做“坭肉田”。以“肉”表示田肥，以“坭”表示耕性适宜和结构性良好。因此一提“坭肉田”农民就称道不止，同时，一提“坭肉田”，农民也知道它的缺点，如易使水稻倒伏，需要排水等。农民对一种耕性不好结构性不好的田叫做“冷饭田”。可以想见这是一种什么形象。好比一块冷饭疙瘩泡在冷水里，水饭不相溶，“吃”起来也会肚子痛的。一提这种田，农民就知道这是低等田，改良的措施是加草木灰、谷壳、绿肥来把“冷饭”变成“坭肉”。如果不用农民的术语而用所谓“科学”的术语，那么这两种田都可以叫“粘土”。因为按机械分析，这两种土壤的粘粒都在八成以上。这种名称不能表示二者在耕性与肥力上的真正区别。因此，在土壤普查鉴定工作中，要利用农民的通用术语来代替“科学”的术语，并以农民的术语为制作大比例的土壤图的单位，使我国土壤科学提高一步。
    关键在于增加土壤的有机质
    施用大量的有机物质肥料以改良久处阴湿的底土，即施用大量的未腐熟的、半腐熟的和腐熟的有机肥料是改良所普查的一切土壤的良方，是这一次土壤普查中的一个大发现。从1958年广东的晚稻高产事例可以看出，凡是高产的田都是施用了大量的有机物如牛栏粪，老墙土，草木灰及绿肥，化学肥料是用得不多的。这一事实指出，我国今后的耕作制度必须以增加土壤有机质为纲。
    土壤学里最有实践意义的两条原理都被应用在深翻改土里，同时深翻改土也进一步的证明了这两条原理的真实性。一条是土壤有机物质在土壤耕性上的决定作用，一条是土壤的好气性（土壤的一种性质，有好气性和嫌气性两种，好气就是喜欢空气）条件对于土壤养分的存在和吸收的决定作用。在深翻改土的过程中施用大量有机质肥料和其他肥料，结合入砂入坭就扩大了好气性的土壤空间，对于产量的提高起了重要作用。
        总结农民的经验
    在土壤普查鉴定工作中，还必须普遍总结农民管理土壤和改良土壤的整套经验。广东的普查工作证明农民的固有经验和在大跃进中所创造的经验，不但丰富了土壤科学，而且为土壤科学提出了一系列的研究课题。“田间档案”就是其中之一。“田间档案”就是有计划地把土壤从深翻改土起的一切变化记载下来。这些资料的积累进一步指出农业土壤的发生和形成的方向，可以指出大面积丰产的耕作施肥和管理的原则。
    广东的土壤普查鉴定已在土壤科学研究中和生产实践中起了良好的作用。不同的土壤，由于鉴定的指示，作出不同的深耕改土措施，指导了农业生产。对分层施肥，土壤熟化，犁冬晒白（广东农民在冬天把土耕翻晒白，使土壤风化，变松变脆，第二年易于耕作，并可增产），烧土熏土等宝贵经验提供了理论基础。对施用大量有机肥，耕作园田化和“三三制”的必要性提供了科学论证。
