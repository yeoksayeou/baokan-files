Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 22nd: According to a broadcast by Iraqi Republic Radio on the evening of the 21st, Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem, in answering questions from the Middle East correspondent of the American "Time" magazine on the 18th, said: "The Mosul incident was a despicable, treacherous act of conspiracy. Foreign interference from outside was very obvious in this incident. Therefore, this conspiracy ultimately failed." He emphasized: "We believe that every aggressor must be defeated and must also abandon his current ideas because the situation will force him to do so."

Kassem said: "We and the people are concerned about the security of the Republic. We will always be able to eliminate all external conspiracies as swiftly as we eliminated the Mosul conspiracy."

He emphasized: "The people have closely united and are determined to defend their republic and the achievements of their revolution, even to the last drop of blood."

Kassem said: "If you have read foreign newspapers and the newspapers of our neighboring countries, you will be surprised by the news they report. They say that troops have been dispatched from all over Iraq to Baghdad to overthrow the current government and that street fighting has broken out. This means that Iraq has been submerged in a sea of blood. Is this what you see? Iraq, from north to south, is peaceful and tranquil. If you want to see the true feelings of the people, see how they are dedicated to their freedom and the survival of the Iraqi Republic, you can observe it nearby, on your way from the Ministry of Defense back to your residence."

Kassem said, "The facts have proven that the recent Mosul incident was planned externally. In addition to this, they are conducting a propaganda offensive against Iraq, aimed at deceiving simple-minded people and external public opinion. They have sayings such as, 'We have abandoned the goals of the July 14th Revolution,' as if they were our guardians."

The Iraqi Prime Minister said: "We ourselves defined the goals of the July 14th Revolution. We have not abandoned them."

He then re-read to the reporter a passage from the first declaration issued by the leaders of the Iraqi Revolution on July 14th: "People, we have vowed to shed our blood and contribute everything most precious for you. We will continue to work for you. Power must be handed over to a government that comes from the people and acts according to the instructions of the people. This is necessary to establish a people's republic. This republic insists on the comprehensive unity of Iraq, establishes fraternal relations with Arab and Islamic countries, adheres to the principles of the United Nations, keeps promises based on the interests of the motherland, and abides by the resolutions of the Bandung Conference."

When asked whether Iraq can continue to maintain friendly relations with the United Arab Republic, Kassem said: "The people of Egypt and the people of Syria are our brothers, and we will not abandon them." He said that we will inevitably have good relations with all countries that do not harbor aggressive intentions and do not create unrest, chaos, and bloodshed in our country.

Kassem reiterated Iraq's adherence to a policy of neutrality. He said: "We do not lean to the East, nor do we lean to the West. We treat them according to the degree of their friendship towards us. We are friends of all."

In response to the reporter's question about whether Iraq intends to lead Arab countries, Kassem said: "We do not want to lead anyone because the people understand their own destiny. However, we will cooperate with these people on the basis of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country. The people of each country have absolute freedom to establish the government they want. We have fraternal ties with these people. The era of personal rule is over. Now, the people are the deciders of their own destiny." At the end of the conversation, Kassem said to the reporter, "I would like to finally remind you, from now on, do not believe in rumors with ulterior motives." "These rumors will not affect us. They will not affect our progress. Because our country is independent, and I am serving the interests of the Iraqi people and the interests of the Arab nation."

Kassem also said: "Our goal, internally, is to build the country. In addition to this, we will also devote ourselves to assisting Arab countries." He expressed that efforts would be made to improve the people's lives through cultural, health, economic, industrial, and army strengthening work for the construction of this extraordinarily backward country. He expressed his hope that friendly countries would help Iraq achieve its goals, making Iraq a strong, cultured, and civilized country.

    伊拉克人民紧密团结起来　决心保卫革命成果
    卡塞姆指出每一个侵犯者必定要被击败
    新华社巴格达22日电　据伊拉克共和国电台21日晚间广播，伊拉克总理卡塞姆在18日回答美国“时代”周刊驻中东记者的问题时说：“摩苏尔事件是一次卑鄙的阴谋叛国行为。来自外部的外国干涉在这次事件中表现得很明显。因此，这次阴谋终于失败了。”他强调指出：“我们相信，每一个侵犯者必定要被击败，并且也要放弃他现在的想法。因为形势将会迫使他这样做。”
    卡塞姆说：我们和人民是对共和国的安全操着心的。“我们将永远能像消灭摩苏尔阴谋一样，迅雷不及掩耳地消灭所有外部阴谋。”
    他强调指出：“人民已经紧密地团结起来，他们已经决心保卫自己的共和国和自己革命的成果，直到流出最后一滴血。”
    卡塞姆说：“如果你看过外国报纸和我们邻国的报纸，他们所报道的消息一定会使你吃惊。他们说，军队已从伊拉克各地开到巴格达，准备打倒现在的政府；并说已经发生巷战。这意思就是说，伊拉克已沉没在血海中。你看到的是不是就是这样？伊拉克从北到南，都太平无事。如果你想看看人民的真实情感，看看他们如何为自己的自由和伊拉克共和国的生存而献身，那你可以就近，从你由国防部回到寓所的路上，观察观察。”
    卡塞姆说，“事实已经证明，最近的摩苏尔事件是外部策划的。除此以外，他们还对伊拉克进行宣传攻势，目的在于欺骗头脑简单的人们和外部舆论。他们有这样的一些话，我们已经背弃了7月14日的革命目标了，好像他们是我们的监护人似的。”
    这位伊拉克总理说：“规定7月14日革命目标的是我们自己。我们并没有背弃它。”
    他接着向这个记者重新宣读了伊拉克革命的领导人在7月14日发表的第一篇宣言中的一段：“人民们，我们已经立誓要为你们流我们的鲜血和贡献一切最珍贵的东西。我们将继续为你们而工作。政权必须交给一个来自人民的、依照人民指示办事的政府。这就是必须建立一个人民共和国。这个共和国坚持伊拉克的全面统一，同阿拉伯国家和伊斯兰教国家建立兄弟关系、奉行联合国原则、根据祖国利益，信守诺言、遵守万隆会议决议。”
    谈到伊拉克是否能继续同阿联保持友好关系的问题时，卡塞姆说：“埃及人民和叙利亚人民都是我们的兄弟，我们不会抛弃他们。”他说，我们同一切不怀侵略意图，不在我们国家中制造不安、混乱和流血事件的国家，必然会有良好关系。
    卡塞姆重申伊拉克奉行中立政策。他说：“我们既不倒向东方，也不倒向西方，我们根据他们对我们的友谊程度来对待他们。我们是所有人的朋友。”
    在回答这个记者提出的伊拉克是否有意领导阿拉伯国家的问题时，卡塞姆说：“我们不想领导任何人。因为人民了解自己的命运。然而，我们将在尊重每国人民主权完整的基础上同这些人民合作。每一国人民有绝对的自由去建立他们所要的政府。我们同这些人民有着兄弟联系。个人统治的时代已经过去了。现在，人民是自己命运的决定者。”卡塞姆在谈话结束时对这个记者说，“我愿意最后提醒你，从今以后，再不要相信别有用心的谣言。”“这些谣言不会影响我们。不会影响我们勇往直前。因为我们的国家是独立的，我是为伊拉克人民的利益和阿拉伯民族的利益服务的。”
    卡塞姆还说：“我们的目标，就内部说，是建设国家。除此而外，我们也将致力于援助阿拉伯各国。”他表示，要为建设这个异常落后的国家而进行文化、卫生、经济、工业和加强陆军各方面的工作，并且竭力改善人民的生活。他表示希望友好国家帮助伊拉克达到它的目标，使伊拉克成为一个强大的有文化的文明国家。
