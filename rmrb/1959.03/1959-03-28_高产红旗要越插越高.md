Raise the High-Yield Red Flag Higher

The Steel Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry

For the past two months, Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant have continued to maintain the red flag for the highest open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient in the country. The average utilization coefficient of Plant No. 1 in January and February was 11.9, and the average utilization coefficient of Plant No. 3 in January and February was 13.1, which is about 25% higher than the level achieved by other plants.

Examples of comparisons in January and February are as follows:
	Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant	12.13—14.029
	Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant	11.037—12.27
	Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steelmaking Plant	8.48—9.02
	Chongqing Iron and Steel New Workshop	7.94—8.04
	Chongqing Iron and Steel No. 3 Workshop	8.42—9.78

The main reasons why Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants have been able to maintain this advanced red flag for the national open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient are two:

First, politics takes command: The open-hearth furnaces in these two plants still use manual charging. This is the most arduous process for open-hearth steelmaking workers. The temperature inside the open-hearth furnace is more than 1,600 degrees Celsius, and a furnace holds dozens of tons of material. To manually load the furnace piece by piece, and to do it quickly, to win the victory, steelmaking workers need to have a high degree of consciousness. The workers in the open-hearth furnace workshops of Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants have proven through long-term tests that they are a collective with this high degree of consciousness. The charging time for each furnace of steel is close to, and sometimes even less than, the charging time of similar furnaces using mechanical charging. The emergence of this miracle is a concrete manifestation of the good implementation of politics taking command and the mass line.

Second, a movement for more charging, faster smelting, higher yield, and longer life has been launched. More charging and faster smelting are effective ways to tap the potential capacity of open-hearth furnaces, and these two plants have achieved outstanding results in this regard. Their charging volume has increased more than threefold compared to the original. Increasing the charging volume several times inevitably leads to a series of imbalances and operational problems. There may be two completely different attitudes towards these newly occurring problems; one is to be frightened by the problems and rush back to the old routine; the other is to persist, scientifically analyze the problems, and take active measures to solve them. The employees of Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants have adopted the latter attitude. After the furnace capacity was expanded, they attached great importance to improving the structure of various parts of the furnace body. They closely monitored the impact of the structure of each part of the furnace on the smelting process, just like a doctor watching the patient's condition. Therefore, almost every time the furnace is overhauled, the furnace structure is modified to varying degrees. In addition, they have also made many outstanding achievements in the heating system of the furnace. We know that the key to the speed of the steelmaking process lies in the heating of the furnace charge. The amount of heat required for a ton of steel is fixed, but how to effectively supply the heat energy required for steelmaking to the furnace charge in the shortest time is a very complex technical problem. These two plants improved the thermal engineering of the open-hearth furnace by improving the furnace structure, increasing the chimney draft, and blowing compressed air at the furnace head, increasing the heat load to about 0.85 million kilocalories per square meter of hearth area per hour, which is more than 50% higher than the heat load used by open-hearth furnace plants across the country. Achieving such a high heat load not only did not reduce the life of the furnace body, but also significantly shortened the smelting time. Undoubtedly, this is a successful experience and worthy of learning by all plants.

Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants also stand at the forefront of the country in terms of steel quality and steel material consumption. Under the conditions of poor raw materials in January and February, the qualification rate of Plant No. 1 in January was 99.45%, and the consumption of steel materials was 1,030 kilograms; the qualification rate of Plant No. 3 in January was 99.17%, and the consumption of steel materials was 1,006 kilograms.

In order to produce more steel for the country and ensure that the production task of 18 million tons of steel this year is completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, the employees of Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. Now they have proposed a more advanced target of increasing the open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient to more than 18 in the fourth quarter of this year. We hope that the open-hearth steelmaking workers across the country will learn from Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Steel Plants, learn their advanced operating experience, learn their spirit of hard work, skillful work, and solid work, and quickly raise the technical level of open-hearth steelmaking in our country to a new level.

    高产红旗要越插越高
    冶金工业部钢铁司
    两个月来，上海第一钢厂，上海第三钢厂两个厂继续保持了全国平炉利用系数的红旗。一厂1、2月份平均利用系数为11.9，三厂1、2月份平均利用系数为13.1，比其他厂所达到的水平约高出25％以上。
    1、2月份举例比较如下：
    上钢三厂　12.13—14.029
    上钢一厂　11.037—12.27
    鞍钢一炼钢厂　8.48—9.02
    重钢新车间　7.94—8.04
    重钢三车间　8.42—9.78
    上钢一、三两厂所以能够把这面全国平炉利用系数的先进红旗一直保持下来。最主要的原因有两条：
    第一是政治挂帅：这两个厂的平炉至今仍采用人工装料，这对于平炉炼钢工人来说，是最繁重的一道工序。平炉炉膛的温度是一千六百多度，一炉钢容纳几十吨料；要把炉料一块块的用人工往炉里装，而且要快装，赢得胜利，炼钢工人需要具有高度的自觉性。上钢一、三两厂平炉车间的工人们，经过长时间的考验证明，他们就是具有这种高度自觉性的集体。他们每炉钢的装料时间，接近、有时甚至少于同类型炉子机械装料的时间。这种奇迹的出现，正是政治挂帅和群众路线执行得好的具体体现。
    第二是开展了多装、快炼、高产、长寿的运动。多装快炼是挖掘平炉潜在能力的有效办法，这两个厂是在这方面取得了优异的成绩。他们的装入量比原来都提高了三倍以上。把装入量成倍地提高，不可避免地要发生一系列的不平衡和操作上的问题。对待新发生的这些问题，可能出现两种截然不同的态度；一种是被问题吓倒、急忙回复到旧的常规上去；另一种则是坚持下来，对问题加以科学分析，并采取积极的措施予以解决。上钢一、三两厂的职工们正是采取了后面一种态度。他们在炉容量扩大以后，十分重视对炉体各部位结构的改进，他们像医生注视病人的病情一样，密切地注视炉子各部分的结构对熔炼进程的影响。因此，几乎每次炉子进行中修时，都对炉型结构进行程度不同的改进。此外，在炉子的供热制度上，他们也做出了很多突出的成绩。我们知道，炼钢进程快慢的关键在于对炉料的供热。一吨钢需要的热量是固定的，但如何把炼钢所需要的热能用最短时间有效地供给炉料，则是一个很复杂的技术问题。这两个厂从改进炉体结构、提高烟囱抽力、炉头吹压缩空气等方面来改进平炉热工工作，把热负荷提高到每平方公尺炉底面积每小时0.85百万大卡左右，比全国各平炉厂所采用热负荷高出50％以上。达到这样高的热负荷，不仅炉体寿命没有降低，而且冶炼时间显著缩短。无疑，这是一项成功的经验，值得各厂学习。
    上钢一、三两厂在钢的质量上以及钢铁料的消耗上，也站在全国先进的行列。这两个厂1、2月份在较差的原料条件下，一厂1月份合格率为99.45％，钢铁料消耗为一千零三十公斤；三厂1月份合格率为99.17％，钢铁料消耗为一千零六公斤。
    为了给国家多出钢，保证今年一千八百万吨钢的生产任务提前超额完成，上钢一、三两厂的职工并没有满足于已经取得的成绩，现在他们提出了要在今年第四季度把平炉利用系数提高到18以上的更先进的指标。我们希望全国平炉炼钢工人们，向上钢一、三两厂学习，学习他们的先进操作经验，学习他们苦干、巧干、实干的精神，迅速把我国平炉炼钢的生产技术水平再提高一步。
