Many places, after summarizing and promoting the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, have done a better job in preparing for spring planting this year than last year. The land has been plowed deeper and prepared more meticulously, more fertilizer has been accumulated with better quality, seeds have been prepared in greater quantities and of better quality, and water conservancy work has been done more outstandingly than in the past... All of these have laid a preliminary foundation for this year's bumper harvest. However, can the spring planting preparation work already meet the requirements of spring plowing and sowing? It might be worthwhile to inspect it. Inspection should not look backward, but forward; it should not compare the past requirements for spring planting preparation with the spring planting preparation work already done today, but compare this year's agricultural production requirements with the work already done. Therefore, what "yardstick" to use for inspecting spring planting preparation work is a question worth paying attention to.

Do not forget for a moment: This year, grain production must increase by 300 billion jin compared to last year's Great Leap Forward, cotton production must increase by 33 million dan, and there is also a requirement for a greater leap forward in oil crops. Judging from the multiple of increase, it does not seem to double as it did last year, but in fact the absolute number of increase is very large, requiring continued effort, hard work and ingenuity to complete. In areas where grain and cotton did not double and oil crops did not increase substantially last year, even greater efforts are needed. In order to achieve this year's production targets, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and do the spring planting preparation work more meticulously and thoughtfully than ever before. If the spring planting preparation work is not done well and sowing cannot be done in a timely manner, the bumper harvest will be greatly affected.

It is very beneficial to use this year's agricultural production tasks' requirements for spring planting preparation work to inspect the work that has already been done. Without comparative inspection, one may be blinded by the achievements that have already been made, and one may become complacent and self-satisfied, and no longer strive to do the work better. Complacency is the enemy of progress. Once complacent, the fighting spirit will slacken, and the drive will not be sufficient. If the fighting spirit is not firm and the drive is insufficient, continued leap forward will be impossible. Once inspected and compared, some places may find that the spring planting preparation work, which was originally thought to be almost done, is not almost done but is far from it. Discovering that it is far from enough is not a bad thing for continued leap forward, but a good thing. Knowing one's shortcomings, but not willing to lag behind, one will muster all one’s energy and try every means to catch up.

Those who look at the new situation with old eyes and think that this year's spring planting preparation work has been done almost enough, although they are very few in number, should also be paid attention to. Good leaders must be good at discovering and correctly treating things in the budding stage. If they are good and beneficial to our cause, they should support them and help them grow and develop; if they are bad and hinder the progress of our cause, they should be eliminated in a timely manner in order to lead the masses to continue to advance. The Neijiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province paid attention to grasping ideology in the spring planting preparation, and found that some cadres had developed complacency after achieving some success in the spring planting preparation. It immediately launched a mass inspection of the spring planting preparation work throughout the county, using the new requirements of this year's agricultural production to inspect the spring planting preparation work. The inspection found that the work already done was not enough, but was far from the requirements, so it mobilized the masses to find the direction for continued efforts. This not only powerfully helped the cadres overcome their complacency, but also inspired the cadres to muster more energy and actively lead the masses to launch a new upsurge of spring planting preparation, so that the spring planting preparation work leaped forward one wave after another. This leadership method is worth learning.

    用什么“尺子”检查备耕？
    曾志
    许多地方，在总结和推行了去年大跃进的经验以后，今年的备耕工作都做得比去年更好。地耕得深、整得细，肥料积得多、质量好，种子也准备得又多又好，水利工作做得比过去出色……。这些，都为今年的大丰收打下了初步基础。但是，备耕工作是不是已经能满足春耕播种的要求了呢？不妨检查检查。检查，不能朝后看，要朝前看；不能拿过去对备耕的要求和今天已做的备耕工作比，要拿今年农业生产对备耕的要求和已做的工作比。因此，用什么“尺子”检查备耕工作，是一个值得注意的问题。
    时时刻刻都不要忘记：今年，粮食要比大跃进的去年增产三千亿斤，棉花要增加三千三百万担，油料也要求有更大的跃进。从增产倍数看，似乎没有像去年那样翻一番，实际上增产的绝对数字很大，需要继续鼓足干劲、大干巧干才能完成。在去年粮棉没有翻一番、油料没有大增产的地区，更需要加倍努力。为了实现今年的增产指标，就得认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”，把备耕工作做得比以往更细致更周到。如果备耕工作不做好，不能适时播种，丰收就会大受影响。
    拿今年农业生产任务对备耕工作的要求，来检查一下已经做了的工作，是大有好处的。不对比检查，就有可能被已经取得的成绩蒙蔽了眼睛，就有可能自满自足起来，不再兢兢业业地力求把工作做得更好。自满是前进的敌人，一自满，斗志就会松懈，干劲就鼓不足。斗志不坚，干劲不足，继续跃进就不可能。一检查、一对比，有些地方就可能发现原来认为已经做得差不多了的备耕工作，不是差不多而是差得多。发现差得多，对于继续跃进不是坏事，而是好事。知道自己不足，又不自甘落后，就会鼓足干劲，想尽一切办法，使自己赶上前去。
    拿老眼光来看新情况，认为今年的备耕工作已做得差不多了的人，虽然为数极少，但也应当引起注意。好的领导者，要善于发现并正确对待萌芽状态的事物，是好的、对我们事业有利的，就要扶持它、帮助它成长壮大；是坏的、阻碍我们事业前进的，就要及时清除它，才能领导群众继续前进。中共四川内江县委在备耕中注意抓思想，发现部分干部在备耕取得一些成绩后产生了自满情绪，就立即在全县开展了一次群众性的备耕工作大检查，用今年农业生产的新的要求来检查备耕工作，检查发现已经做的工作不是很够，而是离要求还远，从而发动群众找到了继续努力的方向。这不仅有力地帮助干部克服了自满情绪，而且激励了干部更加鼓足干劲，积极领导群众掀起了新的备耕高潮，使备耕工作一浪接一浪地向前跃进。这种领导方法是值得学习的。
