Xinhua News Agency, March 13th. Since the beginning of spring, various regions have launched patriotic health campaigns centered on eliminating pests and diseases, in close coordination with industrial and agricultural production. Around the Spring Festival, most regions conducted two to three rounds of concentrated efforts. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces and cities, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, approximately 41 million rats and 24.15 million sparrows were exterminated around the Spring Festival after the intensive efforts. Some regions have now made eliminating rats and sparrows a regular task, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for specific areas, combining this with grain protection and land leveling.

After a large-scale upsurge in fertilizer accumulation began in early February across the country, the patriotic health campaign has also developed more deeply. Various regions seized this favorable opportunity to fiercely eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, improving environmental sanitation. Jiaxing County, Zhejiang, proposed sweeping away all garbage, digging out all ditch mud, cleaning out all poultry sheds, picking up all livestock pens, digging out all manure pit mud, emptying all open-air vats and urns, and filling in all sewage pits and depressions. Pingjiang County, Hunan, proposed moving all the soil from toilets, old thatched houses, chicken and duck coops, old brick soil, stove soil, soil around manure tanks, mud from footprints, cattle pen mud, and soil around houses. Shanghai designated February as the National Fertilizer Accumulation and Patriotic Health Campaign Month. In Jiangning District, over 20,000 people formed assault teams on the 15th, completely digging out the sludge from over 10,000 large and small ditches in the entire district in one morning as fertilizer, and taking the opportunity to put down drugs to poison ditch rats in some ditches. Xiaoquan People's Commune in Deyang County, Sichuan, launched the "Hygienic Home" campaign, ensuring that every household had no sewage or sludge, no garbage, no weeds, and no dust in their courtyards, and regularly cleaned poultry and livestock troughs, closely combining fertilizer accumulation with eliminating the "Four Pests" and promoting hygiene.

Currently, most regions are in the season of spring thaw and the resurgence of pests. The Patriotic Health Movement Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has issued a notice requiring all regions in the district to seize the opportunity to carry out pupae digging and toilet renovation campaigns to completely eliminate the breeding conditions for flies. Shanxi Province has also issued a notice requiring all cities and counties to coordinate with spring plowing, manure delivery, and fertilizer accumulation, and to organize a large-scale concentrated campaign to kill fly pupae and maggots. Beijing began a concentrated effort to dig up fly pupae in March. Hongguang People's Commune in Chaoyang District held an on-site meeting on digging up pupae, unearthing a large number of fly pupae near toilet cesspools on the spot. Their experience is: before digging pupae, conduct surveys, divide areas and assign responsibilities, and divide labor during digging, with some people digging and some people picking, so that the action is quick, the digging is thorough, and manpower and time can be saved.

During this period, various regions organized a large number of medical personnel to carry out the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases and parasitic diseases, significantly reducing the incidence of acute infectious diseases and treating a large number of patients with schistosomiasis, filariasis, and hookworm disease. According to preliminary statistics from five provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, and Shanghai, by early February, more than 79,400 patients with schistosomiasis had been treated, and more than 425,000 people had taken anti-relapse medication for malaria.

    密切配合工农业生产除害灭病
    各地普遍开展卫生突击运动
    新华社13日讯　入春以来，各地密切配合工农业生产，展开了以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动。春节前后，各地普遍进行了两次到三次的突击。据江苏、浙江等十二个省市的不完全统计，春节前后经过突击，共约灭鼠四千一百万只，灭雀二千四百十五万只，现在有些地区已将消灭鼠雀作为经常任务，结合保粮护粮和平整土地，指定专人分片负责。
    2月初，全国各地掀起大规模的积肥高潮以后，爱国卫生运动也更加深入发展。各地抓住这一有利时机，狠狠地突击处理蚊蝇孳生场所，改善环境卫生。浙江嘉兴县提出垃圾扫光，阴沟泥挖光，家禽棚清光，牲畜栏挑光，粪坑泥掘光，露天缸瓮倒光，污水坑洼填光。湖南平江县提出厕所土、旧茅屋、鸡鸭埘土、陈砖土、灶土、粪缸周围土、千脚泥、牛栏泥、屋周围泥土都进行“搬家”。上海市以2月份为全民积肥和爱国卫生运动月，江宁区在15日有两万多人组成突击队，一个上午就把全区一万多条大小阴沟的污泥全部挖出来作为肥料，并趁此机会在一些阴沟内放下毒杀沟鼠的药物。四川德阳县孝泉人民公社开展了“卫生之家”运动，使家家院内无污水污泥、无垃圾、无杂草、无扬尘，并定期打扫禽畜槽圈，把积肥和除四害讲卫生密切结合起来。
    目前，大部分地区已处在春暖解冻、害虫复苏的季节。宁夏回族自治区爱国卫生运动委员会已发出通知，要求全区各地抓紧时机开展挖蛹改厕运动，彻底消灭苍蝇的繁殖条件。山西省也发出通知，要求各市县配合春耕送粪积肥，组织一次大规模的灭蛹杀蛆的突击运动。北京市自3月起开始突击挖蝇蛹，朝阳区红光人民公社曾召开挖蛹现场会议，当场在厕所粪坑附近挖出大量蝇蛹。他们的经验是：挖蛹前，作好调查，分片包干，挖蛹时进行分工，一部分人挖，一部分人拣，这样，动作迅速，挖得彻底，可以节省人力和时间。
    在这期间，各地都组织大批医务人员展开冬春季传染病和寄生虫病的防治工作，使急性传染病的发病率显著下降，并且治疗了大批血吸虫病、丝虫病、钩虫病患者。据浙江、江西、湖北、福建、上海五省市到2月上旬的初步统计，就治疗了血吸虫病人七万九千四百多人，进行疟疾抗复发服药四十二万五千多人。
