Xinhua News Agency, March 1st – Colonel Van InHeede, Military Attaché of the German Democratic Republic in China, held a cocktail party this evening to celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of our country, attended the cocktail party and delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that since its birth, the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic has been guarding the western front of the socialist camp, defending the achievements of the German people's socialist construction, and safeguarding European and world peace, and has made significant contributions in this regard. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements of the German National People's Army.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the German Democratic Republic has made unremitting efforts to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. The Soviet Union recently proposed turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, and that relevant countries convene a meeting to discuss and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. These proposals are extremely beneficial to the reunification of Germany and to European security and world peace. We fully support these reasonable proposals. If the Western countries, headed by the United States, reject these proposals without reason, or continue to turn West Germany and West Berlin into bases for aggression against the German Democratic Republic or other socialist countries through any new conspiracy, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. Our government has stated: "Any attack by imperialist countries on the German Democratic Republic will be regarded as an attack on the entire socialist camp, and we will fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such an attack." This statement fully expresses the Chinese people's strong will to support the fraternal German Democratic Republic.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai said that we are deeply convinced that with the unremitting efforts of the heroic German people, and with the support of the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world, the German people's struggle to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany will surely be victorious; all the imperialists' conspiracies to undermine the German Democratic Republic are doomed to failure.

    Colonel Van InHeede delivered a speech at the beginning of the cocktail party. He said that in the past three years, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party, our army has developed into a modern and combat-effective army, capable of defending our people's democratic system, sovereignty, and inviolable borders. Now, all officers and soldiers of our army and the working people of the German Democratic Republic are closely united and working together to fight for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and for making West Berlin a free city based on Soviet proposals.

    Colonel Van InHeede said that our People's Army stands on the western front line of defending the strong socialist camp. We are not isolated in the struggle to defend our republic. It stands shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet army, which liberated our country from fascism and imperialist enslavement, and the armies of other socialist countries, and strives together to defend world peace.

    Invited to attend tonight's cocktail party were Senior General Xu Guangda, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Li Jukui, Air Force Senior General Liu Zhen, Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shun Chu and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as representatives of various services and arms. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan and President of the Sino-German Friendship Association Zhu Kezhen were also invited to attend tonight's cocktail party. Also attending tonight's cocktail party were Mr. Pierbach, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the German Democratic Republic in China, and diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries in China.

    彭德怀元帅在德驻华武官庆祝建军节酒会上说
    德国人民争取统一斗争一定胜利
    新华社1日讯　德意志民主共和国驻华武官范因赫德中校今晚举行鸡尾酒会，庆祝德意志民主共和国国家人民军建军三周年。
    我国国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅出席了酒会，并且在会上讲话。他说，德意志民主共和国国家人民军从诞生之日起，就守卫在社会主义阵营的西方前线，保卫着德国人民社会主义建设的成果，保卫着欧洲和世界和平，并且在这方面已经做出了重大的贡献。中国人民和中国人民解放军为德国国家人民军的巨大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    彭德怀元帅说，德意志民主共和国为争取建立一个统一的、爱好和平的和民主的德国进行了不懈的努力。苏联在不久以前也提出了把西柏林变为非军事的自由城市，以及有关国家召开会议讨论和缔结对德和约的建议。这些建议，对于德国的重新统一，对于欧洲安全和世界和平都是极其有利的。我们完全支持这些合理的建议。如果以美国为首的西方国家毫无理由地拒绝这些建议，或以任何新的阴谋，继续把西德和西柏林变成侵略德意志民主共和国或其他社会主义国家的基地，那么他们必将遭到可耻的失败。我国政府已经声明：“将把帝国主义国家对德意志民主共和国的任何进攻，都看作对整个社会主义阵营的进攻，并且将全力支持德意志民主共和国击退这种进攻。”这一声明，充分表达了中国人民支持兄弟的德意志民主共和国的坚强意志。
    彭德怀元帅说，我们深信在英勇的德国人民坚持不懈的努力下，在社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，德国人民争取建立一个统一的、和平的和民主的德国，一定会取得胜利；帝国主义者一切破坏德意志民主共和国的阴谋，都是注定要失败的。
    范因赫德中校在酒会开始时致词。他说，在过去的三年内，我们的军队在德国统一社会党的领导下，已发展成了一支现代化的有战斗力的军队，它能够保卫我国人民民主制度、主权和边界的不受侵犯。现在，我们军队的全体官兵和德意志民主共和国的劳动人民紧密团结在一起，共同为根据苏联建议的缔结对德和约和使西柏林成为自由城市而斗争。
      范因赫德中校说，我国人民军站在保卫强大的社会主义阵营西方的最前哨。我们在保卫我们共和国的斗争中，不是孤立的。它和以把我国从法西斯主义和帝国主义奴役下解放出来的苏联军队，以及其他社会主义国家军队肩并肩地站在一起，共同为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    应邀出席今晚鸡尾酒会的有许光达大将、傅钟上将、彭绍辉上将、李聚奎上将、刘震空军上将、罗舜初海军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领，以及各军种、兵种的代表。外交部副部长曾涌泉和中德友好协会会长竺可桢，也应邀出席了今晚的酒会。出席今晚酒会的还有德意志民主共和国驻华临时代办皮尔巴赫和各国驻华使节和武官。
