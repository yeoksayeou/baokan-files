Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 3rd: Shenyang's 500,000 workers, after completing the city's January and February plans, have further launched a massive production leap forward upsurge. On the afternoon of March 1st, factories and enterprises in Shenyang's urban area and the ten counties under Shenyang's jurisdiction held a radio broadcast meeting for the production leap forward competition. At the meeting, Zhu Weiren, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, called on workers in the city's factories, enterprises, basic construction, transportation, commerce and other departments to continue to exert their efforts, vigorously engage in the technical revolution, further launch a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward upsurge, and successfully complete the first quarter plan, and prepare for a greater leap forward in the second quarter.

According to preliminary calculations, the value of Shenyang's industrial products in January and February increased by 52.7% compared to the same period last year, and February increased by 13.6% compared to January; the investment completed in basic construction in January and February increased eleven times compared to the same period last year; there have also been varying degrees of increase in railway, highway transportation, and commerce. Especially after the Spring Festival, many units carried out various forms of competition, and a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward upsurge has begun to appear. After affirming the achievements made in January and February, Zhu Weiren pointed out: some enterprises have not yet reached the production level of the fourth quarter of last year, and it will take a lot of effort to complete the first quarter tasks; at the same time, some difficulties in materials, electricity, and fuel caused by the increase in construction scale and production leap forward still need to be actively overcome. He asked the city's workers to act quickly. Enterprises with better conditions must ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the first quarter plan; enterprises with poor production conditions in January and February that have not caught up with the first quarter plan progress should vigorously mobilize the masses, overcome difficulties, and strive to complete the first quarter plan; commercial enterprise workers should vigorously engage in commodity procurement, rationally allocate commodities, and do everything possible to ensure market supply.

After Zhu Weiren's report, workers in the city's industry, basic construction, transportation, commerce and other departments immediately put forward challenges and response conditions. The 53rd Factory took the lead and first issued a challenge to the city's factories and enterprises. Subsequently, Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory, Shenyang South Railway Station, Shenyang Fourth Construction Engineering Company, Shenhe District Department Store and other units successively announced the response conditions, and respectively issued challenges to various units in their systems. Units participating in the conference scattered in the city and ten suburban counties also called the central venue to respond to the challenge. The products produced by the 53rd Factory this year are diverse and technically complex, but after discussion among the workers, not only will the output of the main products exceed last year, but the quality will also reach or exceed the advanced domestic level. All the factory workers also proposed to resolutely complete the first quarter production plan, and lay the foundation for completing the annual leap forward plan. The workers of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, which is responsible for manufacturing key equipment such as rolling steel, mineral processing, and coal washing, proposed to overcome all difficulties and ensure that the output of products in March will increase by 70% compared to January and 40% to 50% compared to February. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which had completed the February plan three days ahead of schedule, guaranteed to complete the first quarter task one week ahead of schedule, and put forward six specific and effective measures. Other units have also put forward clear indicators and specific guarantee measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 3rd: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial telephone conference on March 1st, calling on workers throughout the province to launch a greater leap forward upsurge in industrial production and strive to comprehensively complete the first quarter industrial production plan.

The meeting was presided over by Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, spoke at the meeting.

After analyzing the current situation of industrial production in the province, the meeting pointed out: there is still one month left in the first quarter, and party committees at all levels must seize the opportunity and take all measures to strive to complete and overfulfill the first quarter's total industrial output value and the state's unified product plan. At present, we should especially strengthen the production of iron and steel, coal, machinery, chemicals, and timber. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the meeting required party committees at all levels to focus on the following six aspects of work: 1. The first secretary should take the lead in unified arrangement of the production plan and solve the ideological and specific problems existing in the completion of the plan. 2. Conscientiously implement the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard." In the plan arrangement, we must first ensure the completion of the state's product tasks and allocation tasks, and secondly, complete the tasks arranged by the province. Under this premise, we should properly arrange the tasks of the region. 3. Solve the problem of raw materials. The raw materials required for industrial production in the province in the first quarter can basically be balanced. Now it is required that the use should be prioritized according to importance and urgency, emphasizing concentration and opposing decentralization; we must also actively find some substitute materials and increase the production of raw materials as much as possible. 4. Strengthen transportation work, especially give full play to the role of civil transportation tools and strengthen short-distance transportation. 5. Rationally adjust the labor force. 6. Quickly launch a mass movement centered on the technical revolution. Turn the industrial production plan indicators, task completion, existing problems and solutions over to the masses for discussion, and mobilize the masses to launch a technical revolution from product design, process, and raw material substitution.

The meeting finally requested that party committees at all levels should dispatch a certain amount of manpower to factories, mines, steel bases, and basic construction units to earnestly check production conditions and earnestly help solve the problems existing in the work.

    沈阳50万职工争取首季全胜
    江西省委号召全省职工掀起更大跃进高潮
    新华社沈阳3日电　沈阳市五十万职工在完成全市1、2月份计划之后，又进一步掀起一个声势浩大的生产跃进高潮。1日下午，沈阳市市区和沈阳市所属十个县的工厂企业举行了生产跃进竞赛广播大会。会上，中共沈阳市委书记朱维仁号召全市工厂企业、基本建设、交通运输、商业等部门的职工，继续鼓足干劲，大闹技术革命，进一步掀起更大更好更全面的跃进高潮，出色地完成第一季度计划，并且为第二季度更大跃进作好准备。
    根据初步计算，沈阳市1、2月份工业产品产值比去年同期增长52.7％，2月份又比1月份增长13.6％；基本建设1、2月份完成投资额比去年同期增长十一倍；在铁路、公路运输和商业方面也都有不同程度的增长。特别是春节过后，许多单位开展了各种形式的竞赛，一个更大更好更全面的跃进高潮开始出现。朱维仁在肯定了1、2月份取得的成绩以后指出：目前有些企业还没有达到去年第四季度的生产水平，要完成第一季任务还需要作很大努力；同时，由于建设规模增大和生产跃进造成的材料、电力、燃料等方面的一些困难，还需要积极设法加以克服。他要求全市职工迅速行动起来，凡是条件较好的企业，必须保证完成和争取超额完成第一季度计划；凡是1、2月份生产条件较差，没有赶上第一季度计划进度的企业，要大力发动群众，克服困难，力争完成一季度计划；商业企业职工要大搞商品采购，合理分配商品，千方百计保证市场供应。
    在朱维仁报告后，全市工业、基建、交通、商业等部门的职工立即纷纷提出挑战应战条件。五三工厂一马当先，首先向全市工厂企业提出了挑战，随着，沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳水泵厂、沈阳第二机床厂、沈阳南站、沈阳市第四建筑工程公司、沈河区百货商店等单位，相继宣布了应战条件，并且分别向本系统各单位提出挑战。分散在市内和郊区十个县的参加大会的单位，也纷纷打电话给中心会场应战。五三工厂今年生产的产品，品种多，技术复杂，但经过职工讨论，不但主要产品的产量要超过去年，质量也要赶上或超过国内先进水平。全厂职工还提出要坚决完成第一季度生产计划，为完成全年跃进计划打下基础。担负轧钢、选矿、洗煤等重点设备制造任务的沈阳矿山机器厂的职工，提出要战胜一切困难，确保3月份产品产量比1月份提高70％，比2月份提高40％到50％。已经提前三天完成2月份计划的沈阳水泵厂保证要提前一星期完成第一季度任务，并且提出了六项具体有效措施。其他各个单位也都提出了明确的指标和具体的保证措施。
    新华社南昌3日电　中共江西省委3月1日召开全省电话会议，号召全省职工在工业生产上掀起一个更大跃进的高潮，力争全面完成第一季度工业生产计划。
    会议由中共江西省委书记邵式平主持。省委书记白栋材在会上讲了话。
    会议分析了全省当前工业生产的情况后指出：第一季度还有一个月的时间，各级党委必须抓紧时机，采取一切措施，争取完成和超额完成第一季度的工业总产值和国家统一安排的产品计划。当前应特别加强钢铁、煤炭、机械、化工、木材的生产。为了保证完成上述任务，会议要求各级党委抓紧以下六个方面的工作：一、第一书记挂帅统一安排生产计划，解决完成计划中存在的思想问题和具体问题。二、认真贯彻“全国一盘棋”的思想。在计划安排上，首先保证完成国家的产品任务和调拨任务，其次完成省安排的任务，在这个前提下，妥善安排本地区的任务。三、解决原材料的问题。全省第一季度工业生产所需要的原材料基本上可以平衡，现在要求在使用上分别轻重缓急，强调集中，反对分散；还要积极寻找一些代用材料，尽可能地增加原材料生产。四、加强交通运输工作，特别要充分发挥民间运输工具的作用，加强短途运输。五、合理调整劳动力。六、迅速开展一个以技术革命为中心的群众运动。把工业生产的计划指标、任务完成情况、存在的问题和解决的办法交给群众讨论，发动群众从产品设计、工艺过程、原材料代用等方面展开技术革命。
    会议最后要求各级党委要抽调一定力量深入工厂、矿山、钢铁基地和基本建设单位切实检查生产情况，认真帮助解决工作中存在的问题。（附图片）
