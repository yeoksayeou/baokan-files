    The uses of silk
    Mulberry silk can be used to weave silk and satin. In national defense industries, silk is a raw material for manufacturing parachutes and fuses for hand grenades and landmines. Tussah silk can be woven into silk alone, or it can be blended with wool to weave suiting fabrics and plush. Silk is acid-resistant and insulating, so it also has many uses in the electrical and chemical industries.
    Silk is an important export commodity. It is estimated that the silk exported from 1950 to 1958 could be exchanged for 7.15 million tons of steel or 14.3 million tons of fertilizer.

    丝的用处
    桑蚕丝可以纺织绸缎。在国防工业上丝绸是制造降落伞和手榴弹、地雷的导火线的原料。柞蚕丝可以单独织绸，也能和羊毛混纺以后织成西装衣料和长毛绒。蚕丝耐酸、绝缘，因此在电器工业、化学工业上也有不少用处。
    丝绸是重要的出口物资的一种。据计算，由1950年到1958年出口的丝绸，可以换回七百一十五万吨钢材或一千四百三十万吨肥田粉。
