Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Japanese Socialist Party Delegation to China held a farewell banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening to entertain people from all walks of life in China.

　　Head of the delegation, Inejiro Asanuma, said in his speech at the banquet that the Japanese Socialist Party Delegation to China had discussions with Chinese friends on issues related to Sino-Japanese relations, the future of Asia, and the world, and will issue a joint statement.

　　Asanuma Inejiro once again emphasized that we believe there is only one China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.

　　Asanuma Inejiro said that both sides urgently desire friendship between China and Japan and eagerly hope to sign a Sino-Japanese peace treaty.

He wished that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people would continue to grow and that relations between China and Japan would be normalized at an early date.

　　Among those invited to the banquet were Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Changsheng, Li Dequan, Wang Zhen, Chu Tunan, Xu Guangping, Cai Tingkai, Zhou Gengsheng, Lu Xuzhang, Ji Chaoding, Zhang Wenjin, Zhao Anbo, Xie Nanguang, Wu Maosun, and other people from all walks of life in the capital.

　　Also invited to the banquet were staff members of the embassies of the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China.

　　Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji and others in Beijing also attended the banquet.
