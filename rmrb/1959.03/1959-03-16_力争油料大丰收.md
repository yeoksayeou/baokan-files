This year's oilseed production task is a more ambitious leap forward than last year's, with a growth rate even higher than that of grain and cotton. This is the unanimous demand of the country and its people. Although oilseed production increased significantly last year, the growth rate was not as fast as that of grain and cotton, and it still falls far short of meeting the needs of the people. The "Ten Initiatives" proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction includes the following: "Do everything possible to ensure that the oilseed crops produced in 1959, excluding those not used for oil extraction, can produce twice as much edible vegetable oil as in 1958, reaching at least six million tons (i.e., 12 billion jin)." Achieving this goal would mean an average of about 17 or 18 jin of oil per person per year nationwide (including industrial oil). Although this would still not fully meet the needs, it would be a significant improvement compared to the past. Farmers across the country are enthusiastically responding to this initiative and are working hard to complete and overfulfill this glorious task.

The main task in the current battle for oil is to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest. In previous years, rapeseed acreage accounted for about 30% of the total area planted with herbaceous oilseeds (excluding soybeans). This year, the national winter rapeseed planting area has been expanded by a quarter compared to last year, more than any previous year. Striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest is the first battle in this year's overall oilseed bumper harvest. Winning this battle will not only complete a significant part of this year's oilseed production task but also strongly promote the overall leap forward in oilseed production throughout the year. The quality of winter rapeseed sowing was also better than in previous years, with plowing depths two to three inches deeper, planting density one to two times higher, and fertilizer application increased by one-half to one time in most areas compared to previous years. Early field management of rapeseed was also relatively good. All of these have laid the foundation for a bumper rapeseed harvest. However, to ensure a bumper rapeseed harvest, a series of efforts are still needed.

The central link in striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest is current field management. After the start of spring, rapeseed grows very rapidly. Under normal circumstances, rapeseed only grows seven to eight leaves in about 100 days from sowing to the Beginning of Spring; while in less than 50 days from the Beginning of Spring to the Vernal Equinox, it can grow 30 to 40 leaves. The farmers say "spring rapeseed is like a tiger," which is the meaning of this. The faster the rapeseed grows, the more nutrients it needs. Currently, rapeseed is bolting, and some have already bloomed. Applying fertilizer early and often during the bolting and flowering periods is an important key to striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest. Rapeseed flowers are indeterminate inflorescences, and as long as nutrients are supplied to them, they can continue to bloom continuously for a considerable period of time under certain temperature and other conditions. More flowers mean more pods. More pods can lead to a bumper rapeseed harvest. However, just having more pods is not enough; we must also strive for long pods with many seeds. To get long pods with many seeds, we must also supply it with sufficient nutrients in a timely manner. Just having many seeds is not enough to ensure more oil; we must also strive for plump seeds with high oil content. The oil content (fat) of rapeseed is converted from starch and protein during seed formation; to increase starch and protein, there must also be enough fertilizer. To strive for heavy grains, foliar spraying of phosphorus can be carried out during the flowering period. This year, Hunan Province proposed that from now until the Vernal Equinox, all rapeseed fields in the province, regardless of whether they have been fertilized before, should be fertilized two or three times, with a total fertilizer application of no less than 100 dan per mu. This is very necessary. Various localities have accumulated a lot of fertilizer in the high tide of accumulating and producing fertilizer and should use a certain amount of fertilizer on oilseed crops, completely changing the past practice of "a handful of ash as base fertilizer, and applying seedling fertilizer if available" due to neglecting oilseed crops.

For a bumper rapeseed harvest, it is also necessary to focus on topdressing and do a good job in other field management tasks. Due to the high temperatures last winter, many overwintering pests and germs did not die. Special attention should be paid to pest and disease damage this spring, and soil and indigenous methods should be used to eliminate them as soon as they are discovered. According to the situation in previous years, there are often cold snaps and frosts in March. We should be vigilant and prepare for insulation and frost prevention early. Recently, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan and other places have had continuous rainfall, and a small number of rapeseed fields have been damaged by waterlogging, and root rot has also occurred as a result. We should actively organize manpower to dredge ditches and drain water for rescue. Anhui Province's Zongyang County proposed "Go all out for 70 days, vowing to win 1,000 jin of rapeseed per county," and launched a field management campaign centered on heavy topdressing of spring fertilizer, bolting fertilizer, and flowering fertilizer, proposing to completely eliminate three types of seedlings, timely topping to promote branching, resolutely doing a good job in five preventions (preventing waterlogging, frost, disease, insects, and grass), and realizing ditch networking in every field to achieve rain stops water purification, no waterlogging of fields, and no waterlogging of seedlings. With such measures and drive, we can ensure a bumper rapeseed harvest.

Another important task in the current battle for oil is to step up preparations for spring-sown oilseed crops (mainly seeds and fertilizers), do a good job in sowing, and prepare for summer-sown oilseed crops as early as possible. Spring-sown oilseed crops account for about one-half of the total oilseed crop area for the year; moreover, peanuts and soybeans, which have higher yields per unit area, are mostly spring-sown. That is to say, the yield of spring-sown oilseed crops accounts for more than half of the total oilseed crop yield for the year. In the Northeast region, the soybean planting area accounts for 60% of the national spring-sown soybean area; the approximately 10 million mu of flax planted in the Northwest and North China regions north of the Great Wall is also the main source of edible oil for local people. Other regions also have their own local oilseed varieties. Most of these regions only grow one season a year; whether this season is grown well or not determines whether these regions can successfully complete the annual oilseed production task. The proportion of summer-sown oilseed crops in our country is also not small. For example, summer-sown oilseeds in the North China region account for more than 60% of the region's total oilseed crop area for the year. However, summer-sown oilseed crops have a relatively short growing period, and the sowing time is also the season when labor and animal power are tight for summer harvesting and summer planting, so it is not easy to ensure sowing quality, and the yield is generally low. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to grasp spring-sown oilseed crops more tightly. If both summer-harvested oilseed crops and spring-sown oilseed crops can ensure a bumper harvest, it will be more certain to complete the annual oilseed production task.

An important issue in ensuring a bumper oilseed harvest is ensuring the planting area and harvested area. Total output is composed of yield per unit area and harvested area. The proportion of oilseed crop planting area in our country in the past and present is not large, while the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's lives have put forward the requirement for greatly increasing oilseed production. In order to adapt to this situation, at present, oilseed crops must not only increase yield per unit area but also expand the planting area. The area of oilseed crops to be sown in various localities this spring should be actively expanded in accordance with the national plan and local conditions. To this end, sufficient seeds for spring-sown oilseed crops should be prepared. At present, it seems that peanut seeds are still not adequately prepared. Seeds are available, but they are mostly scattered in the hands of members of various teams and communes; as long as attention is paid to giving play to the enthusiasm of each production team, paying attention to mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and adopting the method of equivalent exchange, the seed problem can be solved. In order to ensure the harvested area of oilseed crops, active measures should also be taken for the rapeseed currently growing in the fields to strengthen management, protect planting, and protect harvesting, and not to plow and green manure one mu. It is not cost-effective to solve the fertilizer problem by plowing rapeseed fields. In fact, if rapeseed is managed well and a bumper harvest is achieved, not only can the oil problem be solved, but fertilizer can also be increased. After the rapeseed is harvested, its dead branches, fallen leaves, fallen flowers, fallen pods, rotten roots, and oil cakes after oil extraction have a fairly high fertilizer content. A yield of 200 jin of rapeseed per mu can produce 130 jin of oil cake; calculated with a nitrogen content of 4.6% and a phosphoric acid content of 2.5%, the fertilizer effect is equivalent to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate and more than 16 jin of superphosphate. If cultivation is actively strengthened to increase yields, the fertilizer accumulated for the next season will be even more. Oil cake can also be used as feed first, and then animal manure can be used as fertilizer. This is a great good thing that achieves many goals at once. We must see this clearly and conscientiously overcome the negative idea of "harvest if available, discard if not" (not paying attention to management at ordinary times, and plowing when seeing that it is not growing well at the time).

In addition, in order to strive for a bumper oilseed harvest, we must vigorously cultivate woody oilseeds and further explore and utilize new oil sources. Our country is rich in wild oilseed resources. Last year, in the Great Leap Forward, the masses in various localities actively searched for oil sources. At present, more than 400 kinds of wild oilseed plants have been discovered nationwide, most of which are woody oilseeds. In 1958, the country purchased more than 5 billion jin of wild oilseeds, which can produce more than 1 billion jin of oil, which is equivalent to the oil yield of more than 5 million mu of soybeans. This year, these resources should be used more fully. Woody edible oilseeds are an important way for our country to solve the oil problem, and we should actively move forward on this path in combination with the greening of the land. There are currently about 33 million mu of oil tea forests in the country. If the oil yield per mu can be increased to 200 jin, it can solve the edible oil problem for one-third of the country's population. Walnuts in northern China are also an important woody oilseed, and the potential for increasing production is also very large. In addition, tung oil, sapium sebiferum, hazelnuts, and pistacia chinensis are also good woody oilseed crops and should also be actively developed. Now is a good season for afforestation. As many oilseed trees as possible should be planted in the afforestation movement.

Strengthening the Party committee's leadership over oilseed production and carrying out a large-scale high-yield oilseed movement is an important guarantee for realizing this year's bumper oilseed harvest. Various localities should carry out a large-scale high-yield oilseed movement according to different conditions; and fully use the experience of high-yield fields and high-yield forests to drive ordinary oilseed fields and oilseed forests to achieve an all-round bumper harvest.

Oilseeds are closely related to the daily lives of the people across the country. People's lives are constantly improving, and the need for edible oil is constantly increasing. The demand for industrial oil is also growing. We must care for oilseeds as much as we care for grain and cotton. This year, we must get the raw materials for 12 billion jin of edible vegetable oil.

### 力争油料大丰收

    力争油料大丰收
    今年的油料生产的任务，是一个比去年跃进更大的宏伟的任务，按增产的速度来说，比粮食、棉花今年的增产速度还要大得多。这是国家和全国人民一致的要求。去年油料生产虽然增加了不少，但增产的速度没有粮食和棉花快，还远不能满足全国人民的需要。全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的“十大倡议”中有这样一项：“想尽一切办法，使1959年所生产的油料作物，除了不用于榨油的以外，能够生产的食用植物油比1958年增加一倍，至少达到六百万吨（即一百二十亿斤）。”达到这个目标，全国全年每人平均就可以有大约十七、八斤油（工业用油包括在内）。这虽然仍不能充分满足需要，但比起过去来可以说是大大改观了。各地农民热烈响应这个倡议，正在鼓足干劲为完成和超额完成这个光荣任务而战。
    当前为油而战的主要任务是争取油菜籽大丰收。前几年油菜面积约占草本油料（不包括大豆）种植面积的30％多一些；今年全国冬油菜的播种面积比去年扩大了四分之一，比以往任何一年都多。力争油菜籽丰收是今年油料全面丰收的第一个战役。这一仗打好了，不仅可以完成今年油料生产任务的相当大的一部分，同时也可以有力地推动全年油料生产的大跃进。去冬油菜播种质量也比往年好，耕的深度比往年深二寸到三寸，种的密度比往年增加一倍到二倍，施肥量大部地区也比往年增加二分之一到一倍，油菜的前期田间管理也比较好。所有这些，都为油菜籽丰收打下了基础。但是，要确保油菜籽丰收，还须作一系列的努力。
    力争油菜籽大丰收的中心一环是当前的田间管理。开春以后，油菜生长非常迅速。在一般情况下，油菜从播种到立春大约一百天的时间，只长七片到八片叶子；而从立春到春分不到五十天的时间，可以长三十片到四十片叶子。农民说“春菜如虎”，就是这个意思。油菜生长得越快，需要养分就越多。目前油菜正在抽苔，有些已经开花；在抽苔期和开花期早追肥、多追肥是争取油菜丰收的重要关键。油菜花是无限花序，只要有养分供给它，在一定的温度等条件下，它可以在相当长的时期连续不断地开花。开花多，结荚也就多。荚多了就能使油菜籽丰产。可是，光是荚多也还不够，还要力求荚长粒多。想要荚长粒多，又必须适时供应它充足的养料。光是粒多也还不能确保多出油，还要力求籽粒饱满、含油多。油菜籽的油分（脂肪）是在结籽的时候由淀粉和蛋白质转化而成的；要增多淀粉和蛋白质，也要有足够的肥料。为了争取粒重，在花期可以实行根外喷磷。今年湖南省提出，从现在起到春分，全省的油菜田，不论以前追过肥没有，都要追肥二、三次，每亩追肥总量应不少于一百担。这样做是十分必要的。各地在积肥造肥的高潮中积了不少肥料，应把一定数量的肥料用在油料作物上，彻底改变过去因轻视油料作物而采取的“底肥一撮灰，苗肥有就追”的作法。
    为了油菜籽大丰收，还必须以追肥为中心，做好其他一些田间管理工作。去冬气温高，越冬害虫和病菌多未死亡，今春要特别注意病虫为害，应当用土洋结合的办法，随发现随消灭，彻底除治。根据历年情况，3月间常有寒潮霜冻，应提高警惕，早作保温防冻的准备。最近江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南等地，阴雨连绵，已有少数油菜田受渍被害，也有因此而发生根腐病的，应积极组织人力，开沟排水抢救。安徽省枞阳县提出“大干七十天，誓夺油菜千斤县”，开展了以大追春肥、苔肥、花肥为中心的田间管理运动，提出彻底消灭三类苗，适时打苔促进分枝，坚决做好五防（防渍、防冻、防病、防虫、防草荒），田田实现沟网化，达到雨住水净，不涝田，不渍苗。有这样的措施和干劲，才能确保油菜丰收。
    当前为油而战的另一个重要任务是加紧为春播油料作物作准备（主要是种子和肥料），切实做好播种工作，并且及早为夏播油料作物做好准备。春播油料作物占全年油料作物种植面积二分之一左右；而且单位面积产量较高的花生、大豆，大部分是春播的。这也就是说，春播油料作物的产量占全年油料作物产量的一半以上。东北地区，大豆种植面积占全国春播大豆面积的60％；西北和华北长城以北地区种植的一千万亩左右胡麻也是当地人民食用的主要油源。其它一些地区也各有本地的油料品种。这些地区大都一年只种一季；这一季种得好不好，就决定了这些地区全年油料生产任务能不能胜利完成。我国夏播油料作物占的比重也不小。如华北地区夏播油料就占这个地区全年油料作物面积的60％以上。但是，夏播油料作物生长期比较短，播种的时候又正是夏收夏种劳力畜力紧张的季节，不易保证播种质量，产量一般较低。因此，特别需要把春播油料作物抓得更紧些。夏收油料作物和春播油料作物都能确保丰收，完成全年的油料生产任务就比较有把握了。
    保证油料大丰收的一个重要问题是保证种植面积和收获面积。总产量是由单位面积产量和收获面积构成的。我国油料作物过去和现在的种植面积比例是不大的，而国民经济的发展和人民生活的不断提高，对油料提出了大大增产的要求。为了适应这种情况，在当前来说，油料作物既要提高单位产量，又要扩大种植面积。各地今年春播的油料作物面积要根据国家计划和当地情况积极扩大。为此，应准备足够的春播油料作物种子。目前看来，花生种子准备的还不足。种子是有的，但大都分散在各队社员手里；只要注意发挥各个生产队的积极性，注意发动群众、依靠群众，并且采取等价交换的办法，种子问题是可以解决的。为了保证油料作物的收获面积，对于现在田间生长的油菜，还要采取积极的措施，加强管理，保种保收，不要有一亩翻耕沤青。用翻耕油菜田的办法来解决肥料问题是不合算的。实际上，把油菜管理好了，丰收了，不但可以解决油料问题，同时也可以增加肥料。油菜籽收获以后，它的枯枝、落叶、落花、落荚、腐根以及榨油后的油饼，肥分是相当高的。亩产二百斤菜籽，就可产油饼一百三十斤；以含氮4.6％、磷酸2.5％计算，肥效就相当于三十斤硫酸铵和十六斤多过磷酸钙。如果积极加强培育，提高产量，为下季积累的肥料就会更多。油饼还可以先作饲料，然后用牲畜粪便作肥料。这是一举几得的大好事。必须看清楚这一点，认真克服那种“有就收、无就丢”（平时不注意管理，到时候看到长得不好就翻耕）的消极的想法。
    此外，为了争取油料大丰收，还要大力培育木本油料，并进一步发掘和利用新的油源。我国野生油料资源十分丰富。去年在大跃进中各地群众积极寻找油源；目前全国已发现的野生油料植物有四百多种，其中绝大部分是木本油料。1958年全国收购的野生油料达五十多亿斤，可产油十亿斤以上，约等于五百多万亩大豆的出油量。对于这方面的资源，今年应该更加充分地利用。食用油料木本化是我国解决油料问题的重要途径，应当结合大地园林化，积极地在这条道路上前进。全国现有油茶林约三千三百万亩，如果每亩产油量能提高到二百斤，就可解决全国三分之一人口的食油问题。我国北方的核桃也是重要的木本油料之一，增产潜力也很大。另外，油桐、乌桕、榛子、黄连木等也是很好的木本油料作物，也应积极发展。目前正是造林的大好时节，在造林运动中应当尽可能多种油料林木。
    加强党委对油料生产的领导，开展油料大面积丰产运动，是实现今年油料大丰收的重要保证。各地应根据不同条件开展一个油料大面积高额丰产运动；并充分利用丰产田和丰产林的经验，带动一般油料田和油料林，达到全面丰收。
    油料同全国人民日常生活有极密切的关系。人民生活正在不断改善，对食油的需要不断增加，工业用油的需要量也不断增长。必须像关心粮食、棉花一样关心油料。今年，我们一定要把一百二十亿斤食用植物油的原料拿到手。
