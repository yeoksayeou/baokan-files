    Rainy Night
    Xiao Fu
    The township committee held a cadre meeting, which lasted until dusk. Secretary Li and I had just stepped out of the township committee's door when it suddenly started pouring rain.
    "Look," he reached out to catch some raindrops, wiping them on his tightly furrowed brow, and then said, "Winter rain, so chilling, even better than cooling oil." His words reminded me, and an idea flashed in my mind. I said, "It would be even better if we could use this rain to make fertilizer!"
    As soon as I said that, he suddenly stopped, jumping up with joy: "That's right! If we pile up those five thousand cartloads of soil east of the village tonight, making them into enclosures, and then let the rainwater fill them, mixing it with the urine from the pond, stirring the soil, water, and urine together, making it both wet and uniform. Wouldn't that be a great quick-acting fertilizer! That would save us thousands of man-hours."
    He was thinking exactly what I was thinking. But, I hesitated for a moment and said, "Our plan is good, but the rain won't wait for us, we need to mobilize everyone immediately!"
    Old Li's energy surged, he didn't let me finish, and regardless of everything, pulled me along, running and saying, "We can't let the opportunity run away from us, we must immediately call a mobilization meeting..." He ran faster and faster, panting for breath.
    Our village is about ten li away from the township committee. By the time we ran to the village entrance, we were covered in mud, and it was completely dark. Huh, in the pitch-black night, the village entrance was brightly lit, what's going on? I was eager to solve this mystery, so I didn't even bother with the umbrella, and ran quickly ahead.
    I wiped the raindrops from my eyelashes, and a magnificent scene of the rainy night appeared before my eyes: gas lamps were shining brightly on the branches of trees, figures darted back and forth in the silver rain, shovels and hoes danced, the sound of rain mixed with voices. Young men were like dragons emerging from the sea, pouring bucket after bucket of urine into the soil enclosures. Ah! And there were women, they didn't show any weakness, each carrying two large buckets of urine, walking lightly and quickly in the mud. Ah! The old men had also come out! Isn't that Grandpa Zhang! He was wearing a straw hat and a raincoat, looking like a general in armor, waving his iron shovel and shouting at the top of his lungs, directing the women to work!
    Looking ahead, the soil enclosures were lined up one after another, like a string of ponds. The water in the ponds and the lamplight reflected each other. Hey! The project was more than half completed! I stood in the rain, dumbfounded. Secretary Li's words woke me up. "Old Wang, look," he waved his hand vigorously, "We don't need to go back to hold a mobilization meeting, everyone is already out!" Suddenly, a voice like a loudspeaker shouted, I could tell it was the voice of party member Zhao Mingqin, "Hey—Villagers! There's not much work left, party and league members stay to work. The winter rain is cold, and you can't stand it, women and old people go back!"
    As soon as he finished speaking, the girls' sharp, powerful voices rang out: "You can stand it, but we can't?" Secretary Li and I were startled awake again by this voice, looked at each other, and smiled from the bottom of our hearts. We threw down our umbrellas, and in a few strides, rushed into this rain-soaked, bustling crowd...

    雨夜
    肖夫
    乡委会召开干部会议，直开到天擦黑。我和李书记刚跨出乡委会门口，不想天上正在哗哗地下着大雨。
    “看，”他伸手接了些雨水，擦在紧皱的脑门上，接着说，“冬雨，凉森森的，比清凉油还好。”他的话，提醒了我，一个念头在脑子里一闪，我说：“能用这雨来造肥，更好！”
    我的话刚出口，他忽的站住，高兴得跳起来：“是啊！要是今夜把村东那五千车土，堆成一个个围子，中间下上雨水，和上池子里的尿，水土尿一搅合，又湿，又匀。那不是上好的速效肥吗！这一来，能省出上千的人工哩。”
    他想的和我想的完全一样。可是，我一转念说，“咱俩这个计策是好；不过，雨不等人，人马必须立刻全部出动才行！”
    老李的劲上来了，他没让我说完，就不管三七二十一，拉着我跑起来，一边跑一边说：“机会不能放我们跑回去，马上召集动员大会……”他越跑越急，喘得上气不接下气。
    我村离乡委会有十来里路。跑到村前，溅了一身泥水，天也全黑啦。咦，大黑夜，村前却是亮闪闪的一片，这是怎么回事呢？我急欲解开这个谜，索性连伞也不打啦，就飞快地奔到前边去了。
    我擦了擦沾满雨水的眼睫毛，一幅雨夜奇景出现在我眼前：汽灯在树枝上高照，条条银丝中，人影穿梭，扬锨舞镢，雨声，夹着语声。小伙子们像蛟龙出海，把一桶桶尿往土围子里倒。啊！还有妇女，她们毫不示弱，一人挑着两大桶尿，在稀泥里走得又轻又快。啊！老大爷们也出马了！那不是张大爷吗！他头顶草笠、身披蓑衣，活像一位披甲戴盔的将军，正舞着铁锨，扯着嗓子，在指挥妇女们干！
    往前看，一个个土围子排开去，像一串池塘。池水、灯光交相辉映。嘿！工程完成一大半啦！我站在雨里，看呆了。李书记的话惊醒了我。“老王，看，”他把手用劲一挥，“我们不用回去开动员会啦，人马全出动了！”忽然，那边一个大喇叭似的嗓子喊起来，一听就知道是党员赵明琴的声音“喂——乡亲们！剩下的活不多啦，党、团员留下干。冬雨凉，受不住，妇女、老人都回去！”
    他的话才落音，姑娘们尖尖的、厉害的声音响起来：“你们受得住，我们就受不住？”我和李书记重被这声音惊醒，互相看了看，从心里笑了。我俩扔下伞，几个箭步，蹿到这雨夜沸腾的人群中……。
