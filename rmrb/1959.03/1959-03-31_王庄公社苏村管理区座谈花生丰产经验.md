    The Wangzhuang Commune's Sucun Management Area in Fan County, Shandong Province, held a symposium on the experiences of consecutive years of high peanut yields. From their personal experiences, they realized that to achieve high yields, it is necessary to specifically apply the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and "Pass the Five Gates." The so-called "Five Gates" are: (1) Land Preparation Gate. This gate emphasizes soil and fertilizer. Generally, peanut fields should be deeply plowed to a depth of 1.5 chi (approximately 1.5 feet), and various fertilizers suitable for peanut growth should be applied in layers during deep plowing. (2) Sowing Gate. It is necessary to select improved varieties and plant at a reasonable density. Based on the principles of sparse planting on fertile land, dense planting on poor land, sparse planting on newly cultivated land, and dense planting on repeatedly cultivated land, general fields should be planted with 12,000 mounds per mu (approximately 0.16 acres), with a row spacing of 6 cun (approximately 6 inches) and a plant spacing of 8 cun (approximately 8 inches). (3) Seedling Protection Gate. (4) Flowering Gate. It is crucial to water three times during the initial flowering stage, the peak flowering stage, and the flower fading stage to promote flower opening. (5) Pod Development Gate. Currently, 120 technicians have been trained to actively carry out various preparatory work.

    王庄公社苏村管理区座谈花生丰产经验
    本报讯　山东范县王庄公社苏村管理区，座谈花生连年丰收的经验。他们从亲身体验中认识到：要丰收就要具体运用“八字宪法”和“过好五关”。所谓“五关”是：（1）整地关。这一关要突出抓住土和肥，一般花生田要深翻一尺五寸，并结合深翻分层施加各种适于花生生长的肥料。（2）播种关。要选用良种，合理密植。根据肥地稀、薄地密、新茬稀、重茬密的原则，一般田种植一万二千墩，行距六寸，株距八寸。（3）保苗关。（4）开花关。掌握开花初期、盛期、谢花期分别浇好三次关键水，有利花朵的开放。（5）结果关。目前，已训练一百二十名技术员，积极进行各项准备工作。
