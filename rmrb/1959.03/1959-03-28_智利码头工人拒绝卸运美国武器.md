    Chilean Dockworkers Refuse to Unload American Weapons
    Santiago dispatch: Dockworkers at the port of Antofagasta, Chile, refused to unload weapons shipped from the United States.
    According to a recent report in the "El Siglo" newspaper, the incident occurred when the American ship "Santa Maura," carrying more than 2,300 boxes of weapons, arrived in Antofagasta. Workers at the port believed that these weapons were part of those provided by the United States under its military defense treaty with Chile.
    The newspaper stated that unloading work proceeded very slowly because the vast majority of dockworkers refused to participate in the handling, and the government had to send troops to carry out the unloading.
    The news said that fearing opposition from the Chilean people, this American ship, originally scheduled to dock in Antofagasta in January, had stayed in the port of Arica for a long time. At that time, the weapons were unloaded by the military at night and under "absolute secrecy." Afterwards, they were carefully reloaded onto the ship and transported to the port of Antofagasta.

    智利码头工人拒绝卸运美国武器
    圣地亚哥消息：智利安托法加斯塔港的码头工人拒绝卸运从美国运到的武器。
    据“世纪报”最近报道，这件事是在载运二千三百多箱武器的美国船“圣马瑟号”到达安托法加斯塔的时候发生的。这个港口的工人认为，这船武器是美国根据它同智利签订的军事防御条约所提供的部分武器。
    报纸说，由于绝大部分码头工人拒绝参加搬运，卸运工作进行得非常缓慢，政府只得派军队来进行搬运。
    消息说，由于害怕遭到智利人民的反对，这艘预定1月份在安托法加斯塔靠岸的美国船曾在亚里加港口停了很久。当时这船武器是在夜里并且是在“绝对秘密”的情况下由军队卸下。以后才又小心谨慎地重新装船运到安托法加斯塔港。
