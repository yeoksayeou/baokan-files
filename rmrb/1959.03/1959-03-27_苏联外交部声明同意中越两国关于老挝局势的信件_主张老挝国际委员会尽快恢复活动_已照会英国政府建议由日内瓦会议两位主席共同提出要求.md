Xinhua News Agency, March 26th dispatch from Moscow via TASS: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 25th concerning the situation in Laos.

The statement said: The Soviet Foreign Ministry has received and carefully studied the letters sent by Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on February 4, 1959, and Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on February 19, 1959, to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina. These two letters draw the attention of the two chairmen to the words and deeds of Lao state leaders and the United States government, a participant in the Geneva Accords on Laos, which are inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of the aforementioned accords.

The letters pointed out that a large quantity of American weapons and ammunition is now being transported into Laos, and a large number of American military personnel have been sent there. Directly related to this is the fact that the Lao government sent a delegation to participate in the US-Thai military exercises held in northern Thailand from February 3rd to 6th this year. The Chief of Staff of the Lao Army has bluntly stated that Laos is under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, a military-political bloc whose aggressive nature is well known.

The letters stated that the United States government is openly instigating the Lao government to violate the Geneva Accords on Laos and supporting measures taken essentially to abandon the aforementioned accords. Lao Prime Minister Sananikone declared on February 11th this year that the Geneva Accords on Laos had been fully implemented and that he opposed the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission continuing its activities under the aforementioned accords. It is clear that the Lao Prime Minister is attempting to deny Laos' obligation to fulfill those provisions of the Geneva Accords that stipulate the activities of the Lao International Commission. It is noteworthy that this statement by the Lao Prime Minister was immediately supported by a representative of the US State Department.

The letters pointed out that all these words and deeds prove that aggressive forces are attempting to turn Laos into a foreign military base, a tool for creating tension in the Indochina region and undermining the peace of Laos' neighbors. As the official administrative organs of Laos and political factions close to them intensify their suppression, persecution, and discriminatory measures against those who previously participated in the Lao national liberation movement in violation of the Geneva Accords on Laos, Laos has become a restless and unstable region, a situation that is increasingly becoming a serious threat to the security of Laos' neighbors. To this end, the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demand that the Lao International Commission immediately resume its activities, which were temporarily suspended in mid-1958. The two governments request that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina take measures to protect peace in the Indochina region and to promote the continuation of the Lao International Commission's activities, thereby ensuring the effective implementation of the agreement on Indochina.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry statement said: As everyone knows, the two chairmen wrote to the Indian government and the chairman of the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission on January 31st, emphasizing that the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the functions of the Lao International Commission in this country remain valid.

The statement said that the Soviet government, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, shares the same concerns as the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the situation in the Lao region, because the development of this situation seriously threatens the peace and security of the people of all countries in Indochina.

The statement said that the Soviet government has sent a note to the British government, the other chairman of the Geneva Conference, suggesting that the two chairmen request the Lao International Commission to resume its practical activities of monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos as soon as possible. This is still awaiting a response from the British side.

    苏联外交部声明同意中越两国关于老挝局势的信件
    主张老挝国际委员会尽快恢复活动
    已照会英国政府建议由日内瓦会议两位主席共同提出要求
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部25日就老挝局势发表了声明。
    声明说：苏联外交部收到并仔细研究了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在1959年2月4日和中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅在1959年2月19日寄给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席的信。这两封信中提请两位主席注意老挝国家负责人以及关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一个参加者美国政府的不符合上述协议的精神和条文的言行。
    信中指出，现在有大量的美国武器和弹药运入老挝，有大批美国军事人员派到那里。与此直接相联系的是，老挝政府派了代表团去参加今年2月3日至6日在泰国北部举行的美泰军事演习。老挝陆军参谋长曾经直言不讳地说，老挝处在东南亚条约组织这个军事政治集团的“保护”下，而这个集团的侵略实质是远近闻名的。
    信中说，美国政府在公开唆使老挝政府破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并支持实质上是为了放弃上述协议而采取的措施。老挝首相萨纳尼空今年2月11日声明，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议已经完全履行，他反对老挝国际监察和监督委员会根据上述协议继续进行它的活动。可见，老挝首相是企图否认老挝有义务履行日内瓦协议中那些规定老挝国际委员会的活动的条款。不能不引起注意的事实是，老挝首相的这一声明立刻受到了美国国务院代表的支持。
    信中指出，所有这些言行证明，侵略势力企图把老挝变成外国军事基地，变成在印度支那地区制造紧张局势和破坏老挝邻国和平的工具。由于老挝官方的行政机关和接近它们的政治派别违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议而对以前参加寮国民族解放运动的人加紧实行镇压、迫害和歧视措施，老挝已变成一个不安宁和不稳定的地区，这种情况日益成为对老挝邻国安全的严重威胁。为此，中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府坚决要求老挝国际委员会立即继续进行它在1958年年中暂时中断的活动。两国政府要求关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席采取措施保护印度支那地区的和平并促使老挝国际委员会继续进行它的活动，从而确实履行关于印度支那的协议。
    苏联外交部声明说：大家知道，两位主席曾在1月31日写信给印度政府和老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席，信中强调指出，日内瓦协议中关于老挝国际委员会在这个国家的职能的规定继续有效。
    声明说，作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联政府完全同中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府一样，对老挝地区局势感到焦虑，因为这种局势的发展严重地威胁着印度支那各国人民的和平和安全。
    声明说，苏联政府已给作为日内瓦会议的另一位主席的英国政府发出一件照会，建议由两位主席要求老挝国际委员会尽快地继续进行它的监察和监督关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行的实际活动。这还有待英国方面的答复。
