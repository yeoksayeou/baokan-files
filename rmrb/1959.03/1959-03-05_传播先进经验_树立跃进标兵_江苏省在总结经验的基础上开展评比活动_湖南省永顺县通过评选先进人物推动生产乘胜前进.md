Spreading Advanced Experiences, Establishing Leaping Models
Jiangsu Province Conducts Appraisal Activities Based on Summarizing Experiences
Yongshun County, Hunan Province Promotes Production Through the Selection of Advanced Figures

This newspaper reports: Celebrating great achievements, commending outstanding individuals, encouraging revolutionary fighting spirit, and striving for greater leaps forward. Under the guidance of this positive spirit, the people's communes in various parts of Jiangsu, through summarizing the overall great leap forward of 1958, have selected thousands upon thousands of good cadres. Through summary and appraisal, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses has been greatly encouraged and promoted, and the democratic life of the communes has become more active, thus powerfully promoting current production and various tasks.

The appraisal work of rural grassroots cadres in Jiangsu Province began in some areas during the rectification movement. During the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, especially after the realization of people's communes, model figures emerged universally and in large numbers. The revolutionary will of the vast number of grassroots cadres is unprecedentedly strong, and striving for the upper reaches, learning from the advanced, and surpassing the advanced have become the conscious requirements of the vast number of grassroots cadres and masses. Therefore, the work of appraising good cadres has been carried out throughout the province. This work has gradually formed a system in many areas. For example, the Yancheng Satellite Commune has three types of appraisals: small-scale appraisals, quarterly appraisals, and year-end appraisals. Last year, there were twenty-four appraisals. After communization, Changshu County selected 3,704 good cadres at a three-level cadre meeting, and Qian Dun Commune in Kunshan County selected 246 good cadres from cadres above the production team leader level, of which 31 were elected as model cadres of the county. The content of the appraisal generally includes high ideological awareness, sufficient revolutionary drive, resolute implementation of the party's policies and resolutions, conscientious study and research, active participation in labor, and close ties with the masses as several main aspects. The appraisal method is to summarize work, fully promote democracy, and conduct free airing of views and debates. Some are appraised by commune members or by absorbing mass representatives, and some are self-appraised and mutually appraised among cadres.

The good cadres selected from various places are active elements loyal to the people and the cause of socialist construction, and they are role models for cadres and the masses to learn from. For example, Fang Changlin, a member of the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Commune in Kunshan County, took the lead in dredging mud to accumulate fertilizer in winter. When he found that the river was about to freeze, he led the commune members to rock the boat in the river at night to prevent the river from freezing, so that the mud could be dredged. Gu Shirong, the secretary of the Fourth Brigade Branch of Qiandun Commune, worked hard to study and work skillfully. He made more than 30 kinds of reforms in farming and 13 kinds of soil fertilizer. The brigade he led had the highest rice yield in the entire commune. These good cadres not only have soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and a realistic spirit, but also always care about the lives of the masses. He Wenjie, the secretary of the Longwang Production Team Branch in Gaoyou County, has always been active in labor, selfless, treated people equally, and cared for the masses. For example, when the land was deep-plowed last year, some commune members were transferred to other teams for production. When some commune members' houses were leaking, he went to check them one by one and repaired 15 leaking houses. The production team he led had an average rice yield of 1,230 catties per mu last year, an increase of more than double. Among these good cadres, some have a lofty sense of collectivism and love the commune as their home. For example, Hu Wansheng, the deputy captain of the Fourth Brigade of Wangting Commune, saw that there was no place to put nine boats in the team, so he demolished the walls of his house and put the boats in the house to avoid sun and rain. Chen Xuegao, the production team leader of the Second Brigade of Ligang Commune in Jiangyin County, saw that the Changjiang Lubu Port Dam was in danger, so he bravely took the lead in breaking the ice and going into the water. Under his influence, more than 100 people joined the battle, rescuing for three hours and turning the crisis into safety.

Appraisal is a great encouragement and motivation for cadres. After the appraisal, the advanced are more advanced, and the backward are determined to catch up with the advanced and surpass the advanced. Zhou Aben, a member of the Party Committee of Ma'anshan Commune in Kunshan County, was rated as a good cadre and was assigned to the Rongguang Brigade, which had the worst foundation, as the branch secretary. Because he worked actively, the team quickly changed its backward appearance. The management of three wheat crops was the best in the commune, and the efficiency of water conservancy construction was also 30% higher than that of general brigades. Zhang Quan'gen, the secretary of the Fifth Brigade Branch of Wangting Commune in Wuxian County, had good thoughts and implemented the party's resolutions well, but he gave less specific help to the two backward teams. During the appraisal, the masses pointed out his shortcomings; the next day after the appraisal, he packed his bags and went to live in these two teams, determined to improve the work of these two teams. In the past, the brigade cadres of Huangqiao Commune in Jiangyin County participated less in production. After the appraisal, the seven brigade branch secretaries, except for one who was sick, were able to participate in production regularly.

Through the appraisal, the democratic life has also been enlivened, and the positive factors of cadres and the masses have been promoted, which has powerfully promoted the current production and various tasks. Before the appraisal, the production teams of Ma'anshan Commune had poor management of agricultural tools, and many were lost. Within three days after the appraisal, all the team's agricultural tools were sorted out. After Gangqi Brigade of Weiwu Commune in Jianhu County carried out appraisal with the focus on running the canteen well, the canteen work was greatly improved. The restaurant was fully equipped with heating equipment, and 31 canteens also raised 280 pigs, which satisfied the commune members.

At present, appraisal work in the vast people's communes throughout the province has generally and gradually become a regular system, and has become an effective method of socialist and communist education.

This newspaper reports: Yongshun County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan Province, has mobilized the production enthusiasm of the vast masses and cadres and teams through the appraisal of "five-good" commune members and team cadres, and is carrying out the preparatory farming movement centered on fertilizer accumulation with soaring enthusiasm.

The appraisal work in this county was carried out on the basis of summarizing last year's agricultural production. After summarizing last year's production achievements, more than 100,000 people and team cadres in the county were organized to study the appraisal conditions of five-good commune members (good labor attitude, good completion of tasks, love of the country and commune, love and protection of public property, good obedience to leadership, and good struggle against bad people and bad deeds), and five-good cadres (good study, good implementation of policies, good completion of tasks, good leadership of production with production, good partial obedience to the whole). With the gradual deepening of the study, a mass self-education and appraisal movement was launched. Through the development of the movement to appraise good commune members and good cadres, a mass movement of inserting red flags was formed. During the appraisal, commune members conducted a relatively comprehensive appraisal of each other with a serious and responsible attitude. During the appraisal, they focused on affirming everyone's work achievements and advantages from a positive perspective, and pointed out the direction for future efforts, so that the vast number of commune members and team cadres received a vivid socialist education. As of January 30, among the 3,526 team cadres who participated in the appraisal, 1,238 "five-good" cadres have been selected; among the 69,652 commune members who participated in the appraisal, more than 17,000 "five-good" commune members have been selected.

Currently, the 111 production brigades and 795 production teams in the county that have undergone the appraisal of meritorious service and commendation have seen a lively political situation of democracy and unity, where everyone learns from the advanced, catches up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced, pushing the preparatory farming movement centered on fertilizer accumulation to a new climax. After the appraisal of the Tawol Production Brigade of the Chengjiao Commune, Wang Fanwu and other four people formed a fertilizer accumulation commando team, averaging 723 dan of fertilizer accumulation per person per day. Subsequently, in this production brigade, a fertilizer accumulation competition craze of "learning from Wang Fanwu and surpassing Wang Fanwu" was set off, increasing the average fertilizer accumulation per person in the entire team from 150 dan to 504 dan. The 34 county committee members and commune party committee secretaries, 105 party committee members, and more than 600 rural cadres working in the county participated in the leadership of production with production. The work of cadres was arduous and in-depth, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was also better than before. The masses praised the cadres for having "four haves," namely: going out with tools in hand, a basket on their back, responsibility in their work, and tasks in their labor.

    传播先进经验　树立跃进标兵
    江苏省在总结经验的基础上开展评比活动
    湖南省永顺县通过评选先进人物推动生产乘胜前进
    本报讯　欢庆伟大成绩，表彰优秀人物，鼓励革命斗志，争取更大跃进。江苏各地人民公社，在这一积极精神的指导下，通过总结1958年的全面大跃进，评选出成千成万的好干部。通过总结评比，使广大干部和群众的革命积极性得到极大的鼓舞和发扬，公社的民主生活更加活跃，因而有力地推动了当前生产和各项工作。
    江苏省农村基层干部的评比工作，在整风运动中就有部分地区开始进行。在大跃进的高潮中，特别是实现人民公社化以后，模范人物普遍而大量地涌现出来。广大基层干部的革命意志空前旺盛，争上游、学先进、超先进，已经成为广大基层干部和群众的自觉要求，因而评选好干部的工作，就在全省各地开展起来。这一工作，在不少地区逐渐形成制度。如盐城卫星公社，有小段评、季度评、年终评三种评比，去年已评了二十四次。公社化以后，常熟县在三级干部会上评出好干部三千七百零四名，昆山县茜墩公社在生产队长以上干部中评出好干部二百四十六人，其中当选为县的模范干部的有三十一人。评比的内容一般都是思想觉悟高，革命干劲足，坚决执行党的政策决议，认真学习钻研，积极参加劳动，密切联系群众等几个主要方面。评比方法是通过总结工作，充分发扬民主，鸣放辩论，有的由社员评或吸收群众代表参加，有的是干部之间自报互评。
    各地评选出来的好干部，是忠于人民和社会主义建设事业的积极分子，是干部群众学习的榜样。例如昆山县马鞍山公社党委委员方长林，冬季带头罱泥积肥时，发现河要封冻，就带领社员夜间在河里摇船，不让河水结冰，好罱泥。茜墩公社四大队支部书记顾士荣，刻苦钻研、实干巧干，在耕作上的改革有三十多种，造土化肥十三种。他领导的大队，水稻产量全公社最高。这些好干部不仅具有冲天的革命干劲和实事求是的精神，而且时刻关心群众生活。高邮县龙王生产队支部书记贺文杰，一向积极劳动，大公无私，平等待人，关心群众。如去年深翻土地时，部分社员调往他队生产，有的社员家里房子漏雨，他就逐家去检查，把十五户漏雨的房子修好。他领导的那个生产队，去年稻子平均亩产一千二百三十斤，增产一倍以上。在这些好干部中，有的是具有崇高的集体主义思想，爱社如家。如望亭公社四大队副队长胡万生，看到队里九条船没地方放，就把自己房子的墙壁拆掉，把船放到屋里，避免了日晒夜露。江阴县利港公社二大队生产队长陈学高，看到长江芦卜港大坝出险，便奋不顾身地带头破冰下水，在他的影响下，一百多人投入战斗，抢救三小时，转危为安。
    评比对干部是极大的鼓舞和激励。经过评比，先进的更加先进，落后的决心赶上先进，超过先进。昆山县马鞍山公社党委委员周阿本被评为好干部后，分工到基础最差的光荣大队任支部书记，由于他积极工作，这个队很快便改变了落后面貌，三麦管理工作在全社最好，兴修水利工效也比一般大队高30％。吴县望亭公社五大队支部书记张泉根思想好，执行党的决议好，但是对两个落后的小队具体帮助少。评比中，群众指出了他的缺点；评比后第二天，他就打了背包住到这两个小队去，决心要把这两个小队的工作搞好。江阴县黄桥公社大队干部过去参加生产少，评比后，七个大队支部书记，除了一个有病外，其余都能够经常参加生产。
    通过评比，也活跃了民主生活，发扬了干部群众的积极因素，有力地推动了当前生产和各项工作。马鞍山公社大队生产队，在评比前，农具管理差，散失的很多。评比后三天内便把全队的农具整理好。建湖县威武公社岗旗大队，以办好食堂为中心开展评比后，食堂工作大有改善，餐厅保暖设备齐全，三十一个食堂还养了二百八十口猪，社员满意。
    目前，评比工作在全省广大人民公社中，已经普遍地逐渐成为经常的制度，成为社会主义和共产主义教育的有效方法之一。
    本报讯　湖南省湘西土家族苗族自治州的永顺县，通过评选“五好”社员和社队干部的评功表模活动，调动了广大群众的生产积极性，人人干劲冲天地开展着以积肥为中心的备耕运动。
    这个县的评选工作是在总结去年农业生产的基础上开展起来的。在总结了去年的生产成绩以后，便组织全县十余万群众和社队干部，学习了五好社员（劳动态度好、完成任务好、爱国爱社爱护公共财物好、服从领导好、向坏人坏事作斗争好），五好干部（学习好、贯彻政策好、完成任务好、以生产领导生产好、局部服从整体好）的评比条件，随着学习的逐步深入，一个群众性的自我教育、评比运动便开展起来。通过评比好社员、好干部运动的开展，形成了一个群众性的插红旗运动。在评选中，社员们都以严肃认真的态度，相互进行了比较全面的鉴定。鉴定时，着重从积极方面肯定每个人的工作成绩和优点，又指出今后努力的方向，使广大社员和社队干部都受到一次生动活泼的社会主义教育。截至1月30日止，参加评比的三千五百二十六个社队干部中，已评选出一千二百三十八名“五好”干部；参加评比的六万九千六百五十二名社员中，已评选出“五好”社员一万七千多人。
    目前，全县人民公社中已经进行过评功表模的一百一十一个生产大队和七百九十五个生产小队，已经出现民主团结，人人学先进，赶先进，先进更先进的生动活泼的政治局面，把以积肥为中心的备耕运动推向新的高潮。城郊公社塔卧生产大队经过评比后，王凡五等四人组成了积肥突击小组，平均每天每人积肥七百二十三担。接着，在这个生产大队里，便掀起了“学习王凡五，超过王凡五”的积肥竞赛热潮，使全队在原来每人平均积肥一百五十担的基础上增加到五百零四担。全县在农村工作的三十四个县委委员和公社党委书记，一百零五个党委委员，六百多个农村干部，都参加了生产领导生产，干部工作艰苦深入，使干部和群众的关系也比以前更好了。群众赞扬干部有“四有”，即：出门手有工具，身有背笼，工作有责任，劳动有任务。
