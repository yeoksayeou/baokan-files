Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: The six southern provinces and regions of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangxi, which account for more than half of the country's sugar production, have proposed a 45-day battle to ensure that all existing sugarcane raw materials are crushed by mid-April, completing the first half of the year's sugar production plan ahead of schedule.

The Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Commerce jointly held a sugar industry production reporting meeting of the six provinces and regions in Guangzhou from February 28th to March 1st to study this issue. The meeting believed that in order to increase sugar production and free up labor, transportation capacity, farmland, etc. as soon as possible to support spring plowing production, it is necessary to crush all existing sugarcane raw materials within the next month and a half.

The meeting focused on discussing issues related to increasing sugar production, such as labor, transportation capacity, and fuel. The meeting believed that all localities should closely rely on the local Party committees, strengthen cooperation with the people's communes, and solve the problem of sugarcane cutting labor. All factories should also vigorously strengthen the transportation leadership of sugar factories, improve transportation efficiency, and shorten the transportation turnover period; make every effort to save fuel and other auxiliary materials; and vigorously carry out technical innovation movements to improve crushing capacity under safe conditions. While grasping the mechanized sugar factories, all localities should also strengthen the leadership of earthen sugar production, restore and build some earthen sugar workshops, and improve the sugar extraction rate of earthen sugar. Commercial departments at all levels should vigorously recycle various packaging materials and increase the supply of packaging materials.

    增产食糖
    据新华社广州7日电　食糖产量占全国一半以上的广东、福建、江西、浙江、湖南、广西等南方六省区，提出要大战苦战四十五天，保证在4月中旬榨完现有的全部甘蔗原料，提前完成上半年产糖计划。
    轻工业部、商业部从2月28日到3月1日在广州联合召开六省区糖业生产汇报会议，研究了这个问题。会议认为，为了多增产食糖，和早日腾出劳动力、运力、农田等支援春耕生产，有必要将现有的甘蔗原料在今后一个半月内全部榨完。
    会议着重讨论了增产食糖有关的劳动力、运输力量、燃料等问题。会议认为，各地要密切依靠当地党委，加强同人民公社的协作，解决砍蔗的劳动力问题。各厂还要大力加强糖厂的运输领导工作，提高运输效率，缩短运输周转期；要千方百计地节约燃料和其他辅助材料；要大力开展技术革新运动，在安全条件下提高压榨能力。在抓紧机制糖厂的同时，各地还要加强对土糖生产的领导，恢复和新建部分土糖作坊，提高土糖的出糖率。各级商业部门要大力回收各种包装材料，增加包装材料的供应量。
