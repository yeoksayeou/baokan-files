From "Eat First, Then Calculate" to "Calculate First, Then Eat"
Tian Lianqian

"Eat first, then calculate" and "Calculate first, then eat" appear to be the same six characters, but they have completely different meanings and effects. When Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County was in the "eat first, then calculate" phase, not only was a lot of grain wasted, but people didn't eat well either. Once "eat first, then calculate" was changed to "calculate first, then eat," more than 300,000 jin of grain was saved in two months, and they ate even better than before.

Jianming People's Commune was established with Jianming Agricultural Cooperative—the "poor stick cooperative" known throughout the country for its diligence and thrift—as its core. Now, this commune continues to maintain and further promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift in running the commune, and has set a brilliant example for us in saving grain.

In people's material lives, eating is probably the most important thing. In the matter of eating, our requirements are to eat our fill, eat well, and save. Eating our fill, eating well, and saving seem to be contradictory, but in fact they are unified. The most appropriate saving is often the most important guarantee for the best improvement of life. The saving we are talking about now is not about asking people to lower their living standards, but about better improving people's lives, so that people can eat better and have more. How can this goal be achieved? As people are well aware, to truly eat our fill and eat well, it is not enough to simply increase grain production; grain must also be used properly.

The bumper harvest of 1958 increased China's grain production from over 370 billion jin to over 750 billion jin at once. Material conditions are much better than in the past, and people's grain consumption in various places has increased. They have the material conditions to eat more and better than ever before. "A clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Since there is "rice," of course it is possible to improve the cooking. The problem now is how to better use this "rice," so that every grain of rice can play its maximum role. This is: implement planned grain consumption and save grain. The Chinese people have always had a fine tradition of diligence and thrift. "Store grain to prevent famine," "Save when the granary is full, don't wait until there is no grain to think about having grain, treat a good year as a lean year, and you won't go hungry in a lean year," and other ancient sayings and folk proverbs are profound and vivid summaries of this fine tradition.

After obtaining a bumper harvest and implementing free meals, is it still necessary to advocate saving? As a fine tradition of diligence and thrift of the Chinese people, saving will never be outdated. At the same time, saving is also an important principle in socialist construction. Therefore, not only after a bumper harvest, but even after social products are extremely abundant and a communist society with distribution according to need is realized, it will still be necessary to practice strict economy. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called on the people's communes across the country: in all aspects of production and capital construction, it is necessary to practice strict economy and prevent and oppose extravagance and waste due to the bumper harvest. Why? The reason is very simple: any item is the crystallization of labor. Waste of products and waste of materials are waste of labor, which is not cherishing one's own and other people's labor. It is precisely for this reason that saving is not only a fundamental principle that we must abide by in carrying out socialist construction, but also our socialist and communist moral standard.

We must both eat our fill and eat well, and practice strict economy. This requires learning from the practice of Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, changing "eat first, then calculate" to "calculate first, then eat," and implementing planned grain consumption; we must conscientiously implement the resolution on several issues concerning people's communes: "The production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation of people's communes must all be planned."

### 从“吃了算”到“算了吃”

    从“吃了算”到“算了吃”
    田连阡
    “吃了算”和“算了吃”看来是同样的三个字，却有完全不同的意义和作用。遵化县建明人民公社在“吃了算”的时候，不仅浪费了很多粮食，人们吃的也并不好；一旦把“吃了算”改为“算了吃”，两个月的时间就节约粮食三十多万斤，而且比以前吃的还好。
    建明人民公社是以建明农业社——就是那个以勤俭办社闻名全国的“穷棒子社”为核心建立起来的。现在，这个公社继续保持并且进一步发扬了勤俭办社的优良作风，在节约粮食方面又为我们树立了光辉的榜样。
    在人们的物质生活中，吃饭恐怕要算是第一件大事了。在吃饭问题上，我们的要求是吃饱、吃好又节约。吃饱、吃好和节约看起来好像是矛盾的，其实它们又是统一的，最恰当的节约常常是最好地改善生活的最重要的保证。我们现在所谈的节约，并不是要人们降低生活水平，而是为了更好地改善人民生活，是为了要人们吃得更饱更好。怎样才能达到这个目的呢？正像人们都很清楚的那样，要真正作到吃饱吃好，光凭增加粮食不行，还得对粮食使用得当。
    1958年大丰收，使我国的粮食产量一下子由三千七百多亿斤提高到七千五百亿斤。物质条件同过去比起来好多了，各地人民的粮食消费量都有了增加，有了比过去任何时候都吃得更饱更好的物质条件。“巧妇难为无米之炊”。既然有了“米”，当然就可能把炊事搞得更好。现在的问题在于怎样更好地使用这些“米”，使每一颗米都能发挥最大效用，这就是：实行计划用粮，节约用粮。我国人民从来就有勤俭节约的优良传统，“积谷防饥”、“省吃要在囤尖上，莫等无粮想有粮，丰年要当歉年过，遇着歉年不挨饿。”等等古语、民谚就是这种优良传统的深刻、生动的总结。
    在获得了大丰收以后，实行了吃饭不要钱以后，还需要不需要提倡节约呢？作为我国人民勤俭节约的优良传统，节约永远不会过时。同时节约也是社会主义建设中的一项重要原则。因此，不仅在大丰收以后，就是到了社会产品极大丰富，实现了按需分配的共产主义社会以后，仍然需要厉行节约。党的八届六中全会号召全国的人民公社：无论在那一方面的生产和基本建设中，都必须厉行节约，防止和反对因为丰收而发生铺张浪费的现象。为什么？道理很简单，任何物品都是劳动的结晶，对产品的浪费，对物资的浪费，就是对劳动的浪费，就是不珍惜自己的和别人的劳动。正是由于这种原故，节约不仅是我们进行社会主义建设所必须遵守的一个根本的原则，也是我们的社会主义、共产主义的道德标准。
    既要吃饱吃好，又要厉行节约。这就要学习遵化县建明人民公社的做法，把“吃了算”变为“算了吃”，实行计划用粮；就要认真执行关于人民公社若干问题的决议：“人民公社的生产、交换、消费和积累，都必须有计划。”
