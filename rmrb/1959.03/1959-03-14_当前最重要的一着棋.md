Short Commentary:

    The most important task for the national machinery and electrical manufacturing industry's current production is to rush-produce washing and coking, mining, steel rolling, power station, irrigation and drainage machinery, and locomotives and rolling stock that are urgently needed for current industrial production. This is the top priority, the most important of all priorities, and the most glorious task for the machinery and electrical manufacturing industry in the national overall planning.
    This year, there are many key projects under construction in our country, and the machinery industry needs to provide a lot of equipment. Why are the above-mentioned equipment items the top priority? This is because after the scale of industrial and agricultural production and construction expands this year, the demand for raw materials such as steel, iron, steel, and coal by various sectors of the national economy has greatly increased. Since the beginning of this year, the production of steel, coal, and other products has greatly developed compared with the same period last year, but it still cannot meet the objective needs. Only by ensuring the rapid development of the production of steel, iron, steel, coal, etc., can we ensure that all sectors of the national economy leap forward better and more comprehensively. In order to ensure the rapid development of the production of steel, iron, steel, and coal, on the one hand, we must give full play to the potential of existing equipment and vigorously increase production; on the other hand, we must rapidly increase the relevant equipment for producing these products, such as mining equipment, steel rolling equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, and power generation equipment, to expand the production capacity of the raw material industry. Irrigation and drainage equipment is necessary to ensure increased production of cotton and grain this year. In short, these six types of equipment are not only related to whether the four major planned targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton can be completed this year, but also related to whether the entire national economic plan can be completed this year. The sooner these six types of equipment are manufactured and put into production, the more guaranteed the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's Great Leap Forward plan will be. Therefore, ensuring the completion of the manufacturing tasks of these equipment items on time, in quantity, with quality, and in complete sets is the top political task of the machinery and electrical manufacturing industry. We must exert the greatest enthusiasm to complete it.
    It is entirely possible to complete the production tasks of these six types of equipment with the existing mechanical manufacturing equipment capacity and raw materials. The enthusiasm of the workers is also very high. There are currently two key issues: one is to earnestly arrange production in accordance with the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and ensuring priorities, placing the manufacturing tasks of these six types of equipment assigned by the state in the position of the top priority and the most urgent, and concentrating the use of equipment, raw materials, and manpower. By mobilizing and using forces according to the principle of prioritizing the most important and urgent matters, we can effectively overcome difficulties such as insufficient equipment and insufficient raw materials. The other problem is to grasp it firmly. The so-called grasping it firmly means not only arranging production tasks to factories, but also specifically arranging them to workshops, work sections, and production teams, formulating specific and detailed progress plans, and then inspecting them daily, weekly, and every ten days according to the progress plans, promptly understanding the situation, discovering problems, and taking measures. In this way, all employees can have specific goals to strive for every day, making every second count and ensuring that the production of every part can be completed on time, in quantity, and with quality.
    Completing the state-assigned manufacturing tasks of the six types of equipment without any mistakes or omissions is the most important move to ensure the victory of the overall national plan at present. Workers in the machinery and electrical industry, exert your greatest wisdom and enthusiasm to complete this glorious task!

### 当前最重要的一着棋

    当前最重要的一着棋
    赶制当前工业生产急需的洗煤炼焦、矿山、轧钢、电站、排灌机械和机车车辆等项设备，是全国机械电机制造工业当前生产的首要任务，是重点中的重点，也是机械电机制造工业在全国一盘棋中所担负的最光荣的任务。
    今年我国开工建设的重点工程很多，需要机械工业提供的设备也很多，为什么上面所讲的各项设备是重点中的重点呢？这是因为今年工农业生产和建设的规模扩大以后，国民经济各部门对于钢、铁、钢材和煤炭等原材料的需要大大增加了。今年以来，钢铁、煤炭等生产比去年同期有了很大的发展，但仍然不能满足客观需要。只有保证钢、铁、钢材、煤等的生产迅速发展，才能保证国民经济各部门更好更全面地跃进。而为了保证钢、铁、钢材、煤炭等的生产的迅速发展，一方面要充分发挥现有设备的潜力，大力增产；另一方面，就要迅速增加生产这些产品的有关设备，如矿山设备、轧钢设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备和发电设备，扩大原材料工业的生产能力。排灌设备则是保证今年棉粮增产所必需的。总之，这六项设备不仅关系到今年钢铁、煤、粮、棉四大计划指标的是否完成，而且关系着今年整个国民经济计划的是否完成。这六项设备越早造好，越早在生产中发挥作用，完成和超额完成今年的大跃进计划就越有保证。因此，保证按时、按量、按质、按套地完成这些设备的制造任务，就是机械电机制造工业的头等重要政治任务。必须发挥最大的积极性来完成它。
    以现有的机械制造设备能力、原材料来完成这六项设备的生产任务是完全可能的。职工群众的积极性也很高。现在的关键有两个：一个是切实按照“全国一盘棋”，确保重点的原则来安排生产，把国家分配的这六项设备的制造任务摆在重点中的重点、急中之急的位置上，集中使用设备、原材料和人力。按照重中有重、急中有急的原则来调动和使用力量，就可以有效地克服所谓设备不够、原材料不够等困难。另一个问题就是狠狠地抓。所谓狠狠地抓，就是不仅要把生产任务安排到厂，而且具体安排到车间、工段和生产小组，订出具体和细致的进度计划，然后按照进度计划，逐日、逐周、逐旬地进行检查，及时了解情况，发现问题，采取措施。这样，才能使全体职工每天都有具体的奋斗目标，做到分秒必争，保证每一个零件的生产都能按时、按量、按质地完成。
    一分不误、一台不缺地完成国家分配的六项设备制造任务，是保证全国一盘棋胜利中当前最重要的一着棋。机械电机工业的职工们，发挥你们最大的智慧、最大的积极性，完成这个光荣任务吧！
