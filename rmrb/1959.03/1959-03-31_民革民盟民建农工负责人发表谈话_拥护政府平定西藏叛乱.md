Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), China Democratic League (CDL), China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), and Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) have issued statements supporting the government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion.

RCCK

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement today supporting the State Council's decisive measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government.

He said that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, violating the will of the Tibetan people, colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, openly tore up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, massacred patriotic people, and undermined national unity. Their heinous acts of treason are intolerable under national law, and we express our utmost indignation. The order issued by the State Council on March 28th is entirely correct and wise, and I, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, express my sincere support.

Li Jishen pointed out that imperialism, which is decaying day by day, is repeatedly defeated in the face of the powerful and united socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world. Unable to find any other way, it resorts to a small group of national scum and political dregs within various countries to realize its dream of subverting socialist countries and undermining the progressive forces of all countries. This armed rebellion by the Tibetan reactionary clique was instigated by imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. Many of the rebels' weapons were imported from abroad, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also repeatedly airdropped supplies to the rebels. Their sinister activities will inevitably be condemned by peace-loving countries and people around the world, and resolutely opposed by the 650 million people of all ethnic groups in the country. The laws of history and the development of the situation are precisely the opposite of the despicable plots of imperialism and all reactionaries. The rebellion of the Tibetan traitors has not caused the division of the motherland and the retrogression of Tibet, but has promoted the consolidation of national unity, the demise of reactionary forces in Tibet, and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the joint efforts of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, as the Tibetan rebellion is rapidly quelled, Tibet will gradually be built into a civilized and progressive place, further consolidating and strengthening the unification of the motherland and the unity of nationalities.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium yesterday to support the measures taken by the State Council to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion and safeguard the unity of the motherland. Those who attended the symposium were Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Vice Chairmen He Xiangning, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Zhizhong, and Xiong Kewu; and Central Committee members in Beijing, including Chen Shaoxian, Mei Gongbin, Wang Kunlun, Chen Cisheng, Liu Fei, He Guiyan, Lu Han, and more than twenty others.

Li Jishen said at the meeting: The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism and betraying the motherland, are carrying out a rebellion. The government's order to suppress it is in line with the interests of the country and the demands of the Tibetan people, and I express my sincere support. The central government has repeatedly shown leniency to the Tibetan local government, but these rebels have regarded this benevolent and righteous attitude as a sign of weakness, and have conspired to carry out an armed rebellion, openly attacking our People's Liberation Army. Such criminal behavior is intolerable under national law and must be resolutely suppressed and thoroughly crushed.

He Xiangning, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Zhizhong, Xiong Kewu, and others expressed their immense indignation at the crimes of the rebels in their speeches, and expressed their firm support for the measures taken by the government. Chen Shaoxian, Liu Fei, He Guiyan, Lu Han, and others also spoke at the meeting. Lu Han said: I am a member of a minority nationality and have a deep understanding of the Party and government's policies towards nationalities. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all nationalities have achieved unprecedented unity and are living an unprecedentedly happy life. The people of all minority nationalities wholeheartedly support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is a heavy blow to the imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique that instigated the rebellion. Mei Gongbin, Wang Kunlun, and Chen Cisheng also mentioned in their speeches that the Tibetan people are patriotic, and the vast majority of the poor farmers and herdsmen, who make up the majority of the Tibetan population, and a large proportion of middle and upper-class people are patriotic. Those who instigated the rebellion were only a small group of national scum who depended on imperialism. They violated the interests of the Tibetan people and were completely isolated among the Tibetan people. The rebellion of this group of reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion will promote the consolidation of national unity and the unification of the motherland, and promote the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

Everyone at the meeting also sternly condemned the imperialism and foreign reactionaries who instigated the Tibetan rebellion, warning them: those who are enemies of the Chinese people will surely be smashed to pieces.

CDL

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued a statement on behalf of the China Democratic League expressing full support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion.

He said that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique took the central government's benevolent and righteous attitude as a sign of weakness and deceptiveness. They violated the will of the vast majority of the Tibetan people, colluded with imperialism, gathered rebels, and openly tore up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. They launched an armed attack on the People's Liberation Army garrison in Tibet. This act of betraying the motherland and undermining unity is intolerable to the 600 million people of the country, especially the Tibetan people. The Tibetan Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army, acting on orders, promptly suppressed the rebellion in Lhasa, and the State Council ordered the dissolution of the Tibetan local government, with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercising the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government. This measure to safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity is fully in line with the interests of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

Shen Junru pointed out that the conspiracy rebellion instigated by the Tibetan reactionary forces in collusion with imperialism aims to undermine the unity of the motherland, make Tibet retrogress, and keep the Tibetan people under their enslavement forever. However, the facts are precisely the opposite of their wishes. With the assistance of patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet, the People's Liberation Army quickly crushed the rebellion in the Lhasa urban area and continued to carry out mopping-up operations. This has further strengthened the consolidation of national unity and promoted the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

CDNCA

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, issued a statement today on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that he represents all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the industrial and commercial circles they are connected with, and firmly supports the orders issued and measures taken by the State Council regarding the Tibetan rebellion in order to safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity. A small handful of frenzied and traitorous reactionary elements in Tibet, under the instigation of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to split our motherland and undermine national unity. Their crimes are heinous, and we, along with the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the country, resolutely denounce their monstrous crimes with incomparable anger.

He said that we are excited to see that the heroic People's Liberation Army, with the assistance of the patriotic people of all walks of life in Tibet, has quickly quelled the rebellion in Lhasa and is taking advantage of the victory to thoroughly eliminate the rebels in other areas. We cheer for the greater consolidation of national unity and ethnic solidarity. We extend our cordial greetings to the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who are bravely fighting in Tibet to quell the rebellion, and to the patriotic people of all walks of life in Tibet who are assisting in quelling the rebellion.

Huang Yanpei pointed out that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country's ethnic policy has always been completely correct. Since liberation, the Party and the government have done countless good deeds for the Tibetan people in accordance with the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and have been loved and supported by the vast majority of the Tibetan people. A small handful of reactionary traitors represent the interests of imperialism and the most reactionary big serf owners, but they regard the happiness of the people as their own misfortune and have always conspired to tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. These national scum regarded the central government's attitude of benevolence and righteousness as a sign of weakness and deceptiveness, and finally launched this rebellion in an attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity. The Tibetan reactionary traitors have chosen the path of betraying the interests of the motherland and betraying the interests of the Tibetan people, which is also the path of self-destruction. This has not only accelerated the demise of the reactionary forces in Tibet, but also promoted the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people, and promoted the consolidation of national unity and ethnic solidarity. We believe that the Tibetan people will definitely unite as one under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, thoroughly eliminate the rebellion, safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, and devote their greatest efforts to building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

CPWDP

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion, saying: The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism to betray the motherland and carry out a rebellion, which is a serious criminal act that undermines national unity and ethnic solidarity, and has aroused the anger of the people across the country. In order to safeguard national unity, the State Council's decision to order the dissolution of the Tibetan local government and have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government is entirely necessary and correct, and we express our firm support. We express our boundless respect to the Tibetan Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army for their rapid suppression of the Lhasa rebellion with the assistance of patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet.

The person in charge said: The Tibetan reactionary clique regarded the central government's attitude of benevolence and righteousness towards the Tibetan local government as a sign of weakness and deceptiveness, and developed to the point of openly tearing up the agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on the measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and launching a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. This is their own choice of the path to destruction. The rapid suppression of this rebellion shows that all acts of treason that undermine national unity and ethnic solidarity are intolerable to the people of the whole country, and are therefore doomed to complete failure.

The person in charge pointed out: With the failure of the Tibetan traitorous clique, the unity of our motherland will be more consolidated, ethnic solidarity will be further strengthened, and a new page will be unfolded in the history of Tibet. We have every reason to believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, all Tibetan monks and laypeople will certainly advance more rapidly and victoriously towards building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

    新华社30日讯　中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深今天发表谈话，拥护国务院采取坚决措施平息西藏叛乱和解散西藏地方政府。
    他说，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，违反西藏人民的意志，勾结帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，公然撕毁和平解放西藏的协议，向我驻拉萨人民解放军全面进攻，残杀爱国人民，破坏国家统一，他们这种罪大恶极的叛国行为，实为国法所不容，我们表示万分愤慨。国务院3月28日发布的命令，是完全正确的、英明的，我代表中国国民党革命委员会，表示竭诚拥护。
    李济深指出，正在一天天烂下去的帝国主义，在强大团结的社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平人民面前，著著败北，无法可施，就乞灵于各国内部一小撮民族败类、政治渣滓，以实现其颠复社会主义国家和破坏各国进步力量的梦想。这一次西藏反动集团的武装叛乱，就是受帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派策动的。叛乱分子的武器不少是从外国输入的，蒋介石匪帮也多次向叛匪空投接济。他们的这种罪恶活动，必然受到世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同声谴责，受到全国六亿五千万各族人民的坚决反对，历史的规律和形势的发展，恰恰与帝国主义和一切反动派的卑劣图谋相反。西藏叛国分子的叛乱不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏人民的新生。我们坚信，在伟大的中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，在西藏僧俗人民的共同努力下，随着西藏叛乱的被迅速平息，将逐步把西藏建设成为一个文明和进步的地方，使祖国的统一和民族的团结进一步巩固和加强起来。
    新华社30日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央昨天举行座谈会，拥护国务院为彻底平息西藏叛乱、维护祖国统一所采取的措施。参加座谈会的有中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，副主席何香凝、蔡廷锴、张治中、熊克武，和在京中央委员陈劭先、梅龚彬、王昆仑、陈此生、刘斐、贺贵严、卢汉等二十多人。
    李济深在会上说：西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，进行叛乱，政府下令讨伐，是符合国家的利益和西藏人民的要求的，我表示竭诚拥护。中央对西藏地方政府一再宽大为怀，但这些反叛分子反把中央这种仁至义尽的态度，看作是软弱的表现，蓄谋进行武装叛乱，公然向我人民解放军进攻，这种罪恶行为实为国法所不容，必须坚决镇压、彻底粉碎。
    何香凝、蔡廷锴、张治中、熊克武等在发言中，对叛乱分子的罪行都表示无比的愤慨，对政府所采取的措施表示坚决拥护。在会上发言的还有陈劭先、刘斐、贺贵严、卢汉等人。卢汉说：我是少数民族，对于党和政府的民族政策，有深切的感受。解放以来，各族人民在共产党的领导下，达到空前未有的团结，过着前所未有的幸福生活。各少数民族人民对共产党和毛主席是衷心拥戴的。政府平定西藏叛乱，对于策动叛乱的帝国主义和蒋介石集团是一个沉重的打击。梅龚彬、王昆仑、陈此生在发言中还谈到，西藏人民是爱国的，占西藏人口绝大多数的贫苦农民和牧民，和中、上层人士中很大一部分人是爱国的。策动叛乱的只不过是一小撮依附帝国主义的民族败类，他们违背西藏人民的利益，在西藏人民中是完全孤立的。这批反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的失败，将促进民族团结和祖国统一的巩固，促进西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    会上大家还严正谴责策动西藏叛乱的帝国主义和外国反动派，警告他们：和中国人民为敌，必将碰得头破血流。
    民盟
    新华社30日讯　中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒发表谈话，代表中国民主同盟表示完全拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令。
    他说，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，把中央仁至义尽的态度当作是软弱可欺，竟违反西藏广大人民的意志，勾结帝国主义，纠集叛匪，公然撕毁和平解放西藏的协议，向人民解放军西藏驻军发动武装进攻，这种背叛祖国、破坏统一的行为是全国六亿人民所不能容忍的，特别是西藏人民所不能容忍的。人民解放军西藏军区部队奉命及时讨平了拉萨的叛乱，国务院下令解散了西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权，这
  种维护祖国统一和民族团结的措施是完全符合中国各族人民利益的。
    沈钧儒指出，西藏反动势力勾结帝国主义策动的阴谋叛乱，目的是妄想破坏祖国的统一，使西藏倒退，使西藏人民永远处在他们奴役下。但事实与他们的愿望恰恰相反，人民解放军在西藏各界爱国人民的协助下很快地就粉碎了拉萨市区的叛乱，并继续进行扫荡。这样就更加强了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    民建
    新华社30日讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培今天就西藏叛乱事件发表谈话说，我代表中国民主建国会全体会员和所联系的工商界，坚决拥护国务院为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，对西藏的叛乱事件所发布的命令和采取的措施。西藏的一小撮丧心病狂的反动叛国分子，在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的策动下，发动武装叛乱，妄图分裂我们的祖国，破坏民族团结，罪大恶极，我们和全国各民族、各界的人民一道，以无比愤怒的心情，坚决声讨他们的滔天罪行。
    他说，我们兴奋地看到英勇的人民解放军，在西藏僧俗各界人民的协助下，已经迅速平定拉萨的叛乱，正乘胜彻底扫荡其它地区的叛匪。我们为祖国统一和民族团结的更加巩固而欢呼。我们对在西藏平息叛乱、英勇作战的人民解放军指战员同志们和协助平息叛乱的西藏僧俗各界爱国人民，谨致亲切的慰问。
    黄炎培指出，在中国共产党的英明领导下，我们国家的民族政策从来就是完全正确的。解放以来，党和政府根据和平解放西藏的十七条协议，对西藏人民做了数不尽、说不完的好事，受到西藏广大人民的爱戴和拥护。一小撮反动叛国分子代表着帝国主义和最反动的大农奴主的利益，却把人民的幸福看作自己的灾祸，一直蓄谋撕毁和平解放西藏的协议。这些民族败类把中央的仁至义尽的态度认为软弱可欺，终于发动这次叛乱，企图破坏祖国的统一和民族的团结。西藏反动叛国分子选择的是背叛祖国利益、背叛西藏人民利益的道路，也就是自取灭亡的道路。这样，不仅加速了西藏反动势力的灭亡，而且促进了西藏民主化和西藏人民的新生，促进了祖国统一和民族团结的巩固。我们相信西藏人民一定会在中国共产党的正确领导下，团结一致，彻底肃清叛乱，维护国家统一和民族团结，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏付出最大的力量。
    农工
    新华社30日讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会负责人就西藏叛乱事件发表谈话说：西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义背叛祖国进行叛乱，是破坏国家统一和民族团结的严重罪恶行为，激起了全国人民的愤怒。为维护国家统一，国务院命令解散西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权的决定，是完全必要和正确的，我们表示坚决拥护；对人民解放军西藏军区部队在西藏僧俗各界爱国人民协助下迅速平定拉萨叛乱，我们表示无比的敬意。
    负责人说：西藏反动集团把中央对西藏地方政府仁至义尽的态度看作软弱可欺，发展到公开撕毁中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订的关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，向我人民解放军驻拉萨部队发动全面进攻，这是他们自己选择了灭亡的道路。这次叛乱的迅速平定，表明了一切破坏国家统一和民族团结的叛国行为，都是为全国人民所不容的，因而也是注定了要遭到彻底失败的。
    负责人指出：西藏叛国集团的失败，我们祖国的统一将更加巩固，民族团结更为加强，而西藏的历史将展开新的一页。我们完全有理由相信：在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，全体西藏僧俗人民一定会更迅速地为建设一个民主和社会主义的新西藏而胜利前进。
