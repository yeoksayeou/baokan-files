Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 19th: The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party entered its final day. At the morning session today, Comrade Gomulka delivered a concluding speech. Subsequently, the congress adopted various resolutions.

In his concluding speech, Gomulka pointed out that eighty-six delegates had spoken at this congress. The congress fully expressed the will of the working people and formulated the direction for the development of People's Poland in the next seven years. The speeches at the congress were permeated with a spirit of unity.

Gomulka pointed out that the most important goal of the Party is to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, while ensuring the development and security of the country. The congress conducted discussions under this premise. This is the most fundamental spirit of the congress.

Gomulka then pointed out the fundamental changes that have taken place in the lives of the Polish working people over the past fourteen years due to the Party's correct policies. He said that we have transformed Poland, which was previously underdeveloped and at odds with all its neighbors, into a member of the socialist family of nations. The alliance and friendly, fraternal relations that unite People's Poland with the Soviet Union, with all its neighbors, and with the entire socialist camp, guarantee Poland's security and greatly contribute to Poland's development.

He went on to say that the achievements we have made in the past have created better conditions for further development in the next seven years. He pointed out that completing the plans to increase labor productivity and investment plans is of crucial significance for achieving the tasks ahead.

Gomulka said that investment cannot be increased any further. Because any further increase in investment would require changing the planned ratio of national income distribution and reducing the planned growth in real wages and rural incomes, which would be incorrect. If wage targets exceed or reach the level of labor productivity growth, it will cause a series of serious and complex problems in the national economy.

Gomulka continued by saying that the principle of "distribution according to work" must be strictly adhered to in wage policy. Violating this principle will hinder the implementation of development plans and spoil the things that need to be done.

He said that the realization of the tasks set by the congress requires strict wage discipline and administrative management adapted to this aspect. The activities of trade unions, workers' self-government organizations, and Party organizations, as well as the collaboration of workers, expert technicians, and administrative leaders in production enterprises, are of great importance for the realization of economic tasks.

Speaking about the Party's rural policy, Gomulka pointed out that our current agricultural policy is correct. This is a condition for guaranteeing the continued growth of agricultural production in our country in the future. However, only agricultural collectivization can solve a series of problems in our countryside. This is the best guarantee for agricultural development. He said that our Party's agricultural policy intends to use various methods to achieve these goals, including agricultural teams. However, these agricultural teams can only achieve their tasks when they are aimed at increasing production.

Gomulka continued by saying that we have no intention of applying administrative pressure on peasants to require them to organize agricultural production cooperatives. However, in areas where peasants have already formed production cooperatives, they should be helped so that each production cooperative becomes an example of increasing production. Coupled with the conscious labor of the members, each cooperative can attract all the peasants in the countryside, so that new agricultural production cooperatives can be established in the surrounding countryside.

Gomulka said that the Third Congress of the Party approved the general line of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, which eliminates the possibility of any Party member doubting the Party line. The Third Congress shows that the Party's political line decided by the Eighth Plenary Session will become the line approved by the Third Congress. He said that our congress should formally express its attitude towards the resolutions passed by previous Party congresses on the so-called right-leaning nationalist tendencies. He said that political practice has long resolved this issue.

However, the resolutions on right-leaning nationalism made by previous congresses based on false and erroneous premises have not yet been formally revoked. This Party Congress should complete this task.

Gomulka said that today our Party is a unified, united, and rock-solid party. The Party resolutely abandoned and eliminated the mistakes that hindered socialist construction and progress. The Party has restored the unity of its ranks on the basis of fighting against dogmatism and revisionism. The unity of the Party is the main source of the Party's invincible strength. We must constantly strengthen the Party, which is the primary responsibility of every Party member.

Speaking on the issues of revisionism and dogmatism, Gomulka pointed out that revisionism and dogmatism have many common characteristics, but also many fundamental differences. Their common characteristic is to undermine the unity of the Party, hinder socialist construction, and attempt to turn back the clock of history. The right of dogmatists to call themselves communists cannot be denied, but in their thoughts and actions, they do not consider the development of history. For them, Marxism-Leninism is a dead dogma, not a science that constantly develops with life.

Gomulka said that dogmatism can absolutely not be revived in our Party. The situation within the Party and the situation of other communist and workers' parties will not allow dogmatism to flourish. The resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which are a continuation of the line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, illustrate this point well.

Gomulka said that there are not many supporters of dogmatism to be found in our Party anymore. Dogmatists can only carry out activities outside the Party, but this kind of activity is dangerous. In the past, we said that many Party cadres were dogmatists or conservatives, which was not without reason. Today, they have already stood on the Party line. As long as they stand on the Party's position, they should be trusted.

Gomulka said that revisionism is the greatest danger to our Party, because dogmatists have no mass base, but revisionists still have a mass base. Revisionists objectively and essentially want to eliminate Marxism-Leninism. The activities of revisionists are supported by all reactionary forces. The fact that the Marxism-Leninism level of most of our Party members is not high also makes it possible for revisionists to carry out activities. Therefore, it is much more difficult to fight against revisionists than against dogmatists. He said that it is right that we talked more about revisionism than about dogmatism at the congress. This is because, although our Party has crushed revisionism, we cannot say that our struggle against it has achieved the same results as the struggle against dogmatism.

When Gomulka announced his gratitude to the forty-four fraternal party delegations who came to participate in the congress, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

Gomulka said that the fraternal party delegations came to participate in our congress, which shows the proletarian internationalist relations between us and demonstrates that the wishes of our Party and the fraternal parties are the same.

At the end of Gomulka's concluding speech, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

Next, Sirenkiewicz, Indrihofsky, Okhab, and Sambrovsky reported to the congress on the drafting of the resolutions on behalf of the various resolution drafting committees, respectively. The congress unanimously adopted the Resolution on the Basic Policy Issues of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party; the Resolution on the Polish Development Plan for 1959-1965; the Resolution on the Party's Rural Policy; and the Resolution on Amending the Party Constitution. Every resolution was passed with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

After passing the above resolutions, the congress began to elect the Party's Central Committee.

The chairman of the meeting announced that during the congress, the congress received more than two thousand one hundred and fifty congratulatory telegrams and letters from urban and rural working people from all over Poland.

The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony at 7:00 pm tonight (Warsaw time).

    波兰统一工人党代表大会闭幕
    哥穆尔卡指出党代会制定了今后七年波兰的发展方针  大会一致通过关于基本政策问题和七年发展指示等项决议
    新华社华沙19日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会进入了最后一天。在今天上午会议上，哥穆尔卡同志作了总结发言。随后，大会通过了各项决议。
    哥穆尔卡在总结发言中指出，在这次代表大会上有八十六个代表发了言。代表大会充分表现了劳动人民的意志，拟定出今后七年人民波兰的发展方针。代表大会上的发言贯穿着一致的精神。
    哥穆尔卡指出，党的最重要的目的在于提高人民的物质生活和文化水平，同时保证国家的发展和安全。代表大会就是在这样的前提下进行讨论的。这是大会最基本的精神。
    哥穆尔卡接着指出了由于党的正确政策，波兰劳动人民的生活在过去十四年中所发生的根本变化。他说，我们把以前不发达的、同所有邻国不和睦的波兰，变成了一个属于社会主义国家大家庭的国家。把人民波兰同苏联、同所有的邻国以及整个社会主义阵营团结在一起的联盟和友好的兄弟关系，保证着波兰的安全，并且在很大程度上有助于波兰的发展。
    他接着说，我们过去所取得的成就为今后七年的进一步的发展创造了更好的条件。他指出，完成提高劳动生产率的计划和投资计划，对实现今后的任务有着关键性的意义。
    哥穆尔卡说，投资已经不能再增加了。因为再要增加投资就必须改变计划中规定的国民收入的分配比例，减少计划中的实际工资和农村收入的增长数额，而这是不正确的。工资指标超过或达到劳动生产率的增长水平，就会在国民经济中引起一系列的严重的复杂问题。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，在工资政策中必须严格遵守“按劳分配”的原则。违背这个原则就会妨碍发展计划的实现，就会把要作的事情弄糟。
    他说，实现代表大会所规定的任务，要求严格的工资纪律以及适应于这个方面的行政管理。工会、工人自治机构和党组织的活动，生产企业中的工人、专家技术人员和行政领导的协作，对实现经济任务具有重要意义。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到党的农村政策时指出，我们现在的农业政策是正确的。这是今后保证我国农业生产继续增长的条件。然而，只有农业合作化才可以解决我们农村的一系列的问题。这是农业发展的最好的保证。他说，我们党的农业政策是打算采用各种方式来达到这些目的，其中包括农业小组。然而，这些农业小组只有在以提高生产为目的的时候才能实现自己的任务。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，我们并没有对农民施用行政压力，要求他们组织农业生产合作社的意图。但是，在农民已经组成生产合作社的地区，就应该对他们进行帮助，使每个生产合作社都成为提高生产的榜样，再加上社员们自觉的劳动，每个合作社在农村就可能吸引全体农民，这样就可以在周围的农村建立新的农业生产合作社。
    哥穆尔卡说，党的第三次代表大会批准党的八中全会的总路线，这就消除任何一个党员对党的路线怀疑的可能性。第三次代表大会表明，八中全会所决定的党的政治路线将成为第三次代表大会所批准的路线。他说，我们的代表大会应该对过去几次党代表大会所通过的所谓右倾民族主义倾向问题的决议正式表示态度。他说，政治实践早已解决了这个问题。
    但是，以前的代表大会基于虚假和错误的前提所作出的关于右倾民族主义的决议，至今在形式上尚未被正式取消，这次党代表大会要完成这一工作。
    哥穆尔卡说，今天我们的党是统一的、团结的和坚如磐石的党。党坚决地抛弃和消除了阻碍社会主义建设和前进的错误。党在与教条主义和修正主义作斗争的基础上恢复了自己队伍的团结。党的团结是党的不可战胜的力量的主要源泉。我们必须不断加强党，这是每一个党员的首要职责。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到修正主义和教条主义问题时指出，修正主义和教条主义有许多共同的特点，也有很多原则的差别。它们共同的特点是瓦解党的团结，阻碍社会主义建设，企图使生活倒退。不能否认教条主义者的把自己称为共产党员的权利，但是在他们的思想和行动中都没有考虑到历史的发展，马克思列宁主义对他们来说，是死的教条，而不是随着生活发展而不断发展的科学。
    哥穆尔卡说，教条主义绝对不可能在我们党内复活。党内的情况，其他共产党和工人党的情况也不会使教条主义滋长。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议，是苏共第二十次代表大会路线的继续，这个决议很好地说明了这点。
    哥穆尔卡说，在我们党内已找不到多少教条主义的拥护者了。教条主义者只有在党外进行活动，但是这种活动是危险的。过去，我们说许多党的干部是教条主义者或保守主义者，不是没有根据的。今天，他们已经站到党的路线上来了。只要他们站在党的立场上，就应该信任他们。
    哥穆尔卡说，修正主义是我们党的最大的危险，是因为教条主义者已没有群众基础，可是修正主义者还有群众基础。修正主义者在客观上和实质上是消灭马克思列宁主义。修正主义者的活动受到了一切反动势力的支持。我们的大部分党员的马克思列宁主义水平还不高，这种情况也使修正主义者有了活动的可能。因此，同修正主义者进行斗争比同教条主义者斗争困难得多。他说，我们在代表大会上谈修正主义比谈教条主义多，这是对的。这是因为，尽管我们的党粉碎了修正主义，但是还不能说我们对它的斗争已经取得了像对教条主义斗争一样的结果。
    当哥穆尔卡宣布对前来参加代表大会的四十四个兄弟党代表团表示感谢时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    哥穆尔卡说，各兄弟党代表团前来参加我们的代表大会，这说明了我们之间的无产阶级国际主义关系，说明了我们党和各兄弟党的愿望是一致的。
    在哥穆尔卡的总结发言结束时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    接着，西伦凯维兹、英德里霍夫斯基、奥哈布、萨姆布罗夫斯基分别代表各个决议起草委员会向大会报告了决议起草的情况，全体一致通过了关于波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的基本政策问题的决议；1959—1965年波兰发展指示的决议；党的农村政策的决议；修改党章的决议。在每个决议通过时，全场都热烈鼓掌。
    在通过上述决议后，大会开始选举党的中央委员会。
    会议主席宣布，在代表大会举行期间，大会从波兰各地收到了城乡劳动人民发出的两千一百五十多封贺电和贺信。
    波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会订于今晚七时（华沙时间）举行闭幕式。
