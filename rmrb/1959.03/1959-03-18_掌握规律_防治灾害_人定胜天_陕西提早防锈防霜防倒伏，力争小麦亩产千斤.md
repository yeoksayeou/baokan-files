Mastering Laws, Preventing Disasters, Man Will Conquer Nature
Shaanxi Takes Early Precautions Against Rust, Frost, and Lodging, Striving for a Per-Mu Yield of 1,000 Jin of Wheat

(Our dispatch from Xi'an, March 17) In order to ensure the realization of the plan to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat this year, the people of Shaanxi Province, starting from the most difficult situation, are mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to fully overcome natural disasters once they occur. This is the guiding ideology in Shaanxi Province's wheat field management work. To implement this spirit, many counties, cities, and communes throughout the province have held on-site meetings to further establish the idea that man will conquer nature.

At present, wheat in various parts of Shaanxi Province is growing strong, with many tillers and uniform growth. The province's Class One seedlings have basically passed the returning green stage, and most of the Class Two seedlings have passed the returning green stage. The autumn wheat sowing last year was early and well done, and field management work was also thorough and meticulous. All of these have laid a reliable foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

According to the laws of natural disasters over the years: early spring drought, frost, and later rainy weather may cause lodging, the leading organs of Shaanxi Province analyzed that, in 1957 and 1958, stripe rust occurred in some areas, reducing wheat production by about 500 million jin. The leading departments also studied and analyzed the relationship between this year's wheat growth and climate: the ground temperature was relatively high last winter, there was more rainfall at the beginning of spring, and the wheat seedlings returned green early, so it is suitable for the activity of diseases and insects. At present, wheat stripe rust has occurred early; this year, wheat fields have generally been deeply ploughed, densely planted, with sufficient water and fertilizer, and dense seedlings, the possibility of lodging is also great; in addition, this year's late frost period may also be prolonged.

In view of the above situation, relevant departments in Shaanxi Province believe that although wheat growth is good at present, it is necessary to anticipate all kinds of possible natural disasters. For this reason, it is required that all localities, on the basis of a series of prevention and control work carried out from last winter to the present, continue to work on water and fertilizer, adhere to the five key stages of returning green, jointing, flowering, grain filling, harvesting and threshing, and do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases, insects, pests, and lodging, especially to focus on three key points: rust prevention, frost prevention, and lodging prevention. From now on, a half-month rust prevention campaign will be launched to completely eliminate rust before jointing. In late March and early April, frost prevention work should be done well, requiring every wheat field to have smoke pits and smoke towers, every commune to organize joint prevention, and to divide areas for contracted responsibility. Lodging prevention should be implemented in all stages of wheat growth, especially at present, five or six days should be used in conjunction with rust prevention to complete harrowing, and in conjunction with fertilization to carry out wheat hoeing and soil cultivation. Recently, wheat high-yield on-site meetings are being held in various parts of Shaanxi to further formulate practical and feasible measures.

Since the beginning of March, the entire province has launched a massive campaign to march towards stripe rust. A scientific corps of thousands of people organized by the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Northwest Agricultural College, and the Biology Department of Northwest University, arrived in the areas along the Weihe River with more serious stripe rust on March 8 to teach prevention and control technologies to the masses. Stripe rust was serious in Zhouzhi County last winter. The county organized more than 100,000 people to carry out prevention and control four times in a row, basically controlling the development of stripe rust. In order to further completely eliminate stripe rust, more than 100,000 people in the county have recently launched a fifth prevention and control campaign. Various localities have prepared a large number of native pesticides, ready to spray medicine powder immediately after wheat turning green, when it is inconvenient to use soil burial and leaf cutting to control it. Relevant departments have also purchased several airplanes to spray medicine powder in key areas.

The anti-frost campaign has also been launched universally at the same time. According to past experience, the masses in various localities have adopted methods such as smoking, irrigation, and mid-cultivation to maintain ground temperature and prevent frost. Areas where frost has been more serious in the past have adopted a combination of frost prevention and smoke fertilization, setting up smoke pits or smoke towers in every wheat field, storing firewood, and immediately setting fire universally when a cooling forecast is received to create a smoke screen. People's communes in various localities have established meteorological groups and frost intelligence networks. In order to prevent frost, areas with water conservancy projects have decided to carry out irrigation in a timely manner after receiving an alert.

In order to prevent early lodging of wheat, various localities have taken the following measures: watering for returning green early, watering for jointing late, and watering for grain filling lightly to prevent wheat from growing rapidly; applying more phosphate and potash fertilizer before jointing to promote strong stems, and at the same time using suppression, weeding and soil cultivation to promote the growth of secondary roots.

Various localities have also formulated many measures for disasters such as drought, wind, and rain. (Feng Senling) (Attached picture)

    掌握规律　防治灾害　人定胜天
    陕西提早防锈防霜防倒伏，力争小麦亩产千斤
    本报西安17日电　陕西省人民为保证今年实现小麦亩产千斤的丰产计划，从最困难的情况出发，动员全党全民一旦遇到自然灾害，就要全力战胜。这是陕西省小麦田间管理工作中的指导思想。为贯彻这一精神，全省许多县市及公社，举行了现场会议，进一步树立人定胜天的思想。
    目前，陕西省各地小麦生长壮实、分蘖多、整齐。全省一类苗基本上过了返青关，二类苗大部分过了返青关。去年秋季小麦播种早、种得好，田间管理工作也深入细致。这些都为今年丰收打下了可靠基础。
    陕西省领导机关根据历年自然灾害的规律：前期春旱、有霜冻，后期阴雨可能造成倒伏。1957和1958两年部分地区发生条锈病，小麦减产五亿斤左右。领导部门还研究分析了今年小麦生长和气候的关系：去冬地温较高，开春降雨量多，麦苗返青早，因此适合病虫活动，目前小麦条锈病已经提早发生；今年麦田普遍深翻、密植、水足、粪大、苗稠、倒伏可能性也大；另外，今年晚霜期也可能延长。
    针对上述情况，陕西省有关部门认为，目前小麦生长虽好，但必须预计到各种可能发生的自然灾害。为此，要求各地在去冬至今进行的一系列防治工作基础上，继续搞水肥，坚持过好返青、拔节、扬花、灌浆、收打五关和作好防治病、虫、害、倒伏，特别是要抓紧防锈、防霜、防倒伏三个重点。从现在起用半月时间开展防锈战役，把锈病彻底消灭在拔节前。在3月下旬和4月上旬，要作好防霜工作，要求块块麦田有熏烟坑、熏烟塔，社社组织联防，分片包干。防倒伏则要贯彻到小麦生长的各个阶段，特别是目前要用五、六天时间结合防锈，完成耙耱，结合施肥进行麦锄培土。最近，陕西各地正在举行小麦丰产现场会议，进一步订出切实可行的措施。
    全省从3月上旬起，已掀起了规模巨大的向条锈病进军的战役。由中国农业科学院陕西分院、西北农学院、西北大学生物系等单位组织的千人的科学兵团，3月8日已分别到达渭河沿岸条锈病比较严重地区，向群众传授防治技术。盩厔县去冬小麦条锈病严重，全县组织了十万多人，连续防治了四次，基本上控制了条锈病的发展。为了进一步彻底消灭条锈病，这个县十多万群众，最近又展开了第五次防治。各地准备了大批土农药，准备在小麦返青后不便用埋土切叶防治时，立即喷撒药粉。有关部门还买了几架飞机，在重点地区用飞机喷撒药粉。
    防霜冻的运动也同时普遍展开。各地群众根据过去经验，采用熏烟、灌水、中耕等办法，保持地温，预防霜冻。历年来霜冻比较严重的地区，都采取防霜和熏肥结合的办法，在块块麦田设置熏烟坑或熏烟塔，储备好柴草，得到降温预报，立即普遍升火，造成烟幕。各地人民公社都建立了气象组、霜冻情报网。水利化地区为了防止霜冻，决定在接到警报后，及时进行灌溉。
    为了防止小麦前期倒伏，各地采取了下列措施：早浇返青水，晚浇拔节水，轻浇灌浆水，防止小麦陡长；在拔节前增施磷钾肥，促进茎秆粗壮，同时用镇压、锄草培土、促使次生根生长。
    各地还对干旱、风、雨等灾害，也都订出了许多措施。　（冯森龄）（附图片）
