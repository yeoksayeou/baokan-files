Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant Workers Break Superstition
Extract Concentrate Powder from Poor Ore

    (Our newspaper's Benxi dispatch, March 15) The Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant has broken the superstition that low-phosphorus powder must be selected from rich ore. Recently, they successfully used poor ore to produce concentrate powder with very low phosphorus content, meeting the standards of rich ore. It has been officially put into production, providing steel mills with excellent raw materials for smelting special steel.
    The task of extracting low-phosphorus powder at the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant was assigned at the beginning of February this year. According to past practices, extracting low-phosphorus powder required rich ore with low phosphorus and high iron content. However, at that time, the iron mine was supplying poor ore with an iron content of only 36% and a phosphorus content as high as 0.05%, making ore dressing extremely difficult. The workers of the first and second ore dressing workshops tried dozens of times without success. Therefore, the plant's Party committee mobilized all employees to contribute ideas and efforts to overcome the low-phosphorus barrier. At this time, the engineer pointed out from a scientific perspective that phosphorus often coexists with gangue and has a low specific gravity. It is necessary to increase the amount of sand separated by the classifier and grind the ore powder finer, which is conducive to separating the phosphorus. According to the properties of phosphorus, the workers used fewer dewatering tanks, increased overflow, and increased the sand return of the classifier from the original 80% to 150%, greatly increasing the opportunities for ore grinding and separation. The crushing workers strictly controlled the ratio of raw ore to maintain a ratio of 80% poor ore and 20% rich ore. With the coordinated cooperation of various processes in the workshop, the workers of the second workshop finally successfully trial-produced low-phosphorus mineral powder on a single system on February 20.
    Using poor ore to extract low-phosphorus powder was only the beginning of the ore dressing work, because at that time a single system only produced two tons of mineral powder per hour. Later, although it was expanded to four systems, the daily output increased to 170 tons, but it still could not meet the needs of production. If the method of adding equipment is continued to increase the production of low-phosphorus powder, it is bound to compress the current output and affect the normal iron production of the blast furnace. Therefore, the workers systematically implemented the high-concentration operation method of crushing, grinding, and multiple separation created by the workers of Yang Chunze's team in operation. Without adding equipment, they improved the output and quality of low-phosphorus powder, making the iron content of the concentrate powder as high as 68.5%.

### 南芬选矿厂职工破除迷信  贫矿选出精矿粉

    南芬选矿厂职工破除迷信
    贫矿选出精矿粉
    本报本溪15日电　南芬选矿厂破除了一定要用富矿选低磷粉的迷信，最近用贫矿选制成功了含磷很低的精矿粉，赶上了富矿的指标，并已正式投入生产，为钢铁厂提供了熔炼特殊钢的优良原料。
    南芬选矿厂提选低磷粉的任务是今年2月初开始布置的。按过去一般的习惯，提选低磷粉一定要用含磷低含铁高的富矿，而当时铁矿山供应的都是含铁量只有36％，含磷高达0.05％的贫矿，选矿时困难重重。第一、第二选矿车间的工人们连续试了几十次都没有成功。于是，厂党委就发动职工人人献计，个个出力，围攻低磷关。这时，工程师从科学原理上指出：磷常常和脉石共存，比重轻，一定要增加分级机的分砂量，把矿粉磨细点，有利把磷选别掉。工人们根据磷的性能，少用脱水槽，增加溢流量，并把分级机的反砂从原来80％提高到150％，大大增加了矿石磨细、选别的机会。碎矿工人严格控制了原矿石保持贫矿80％富矿20％的配比。在车间各道工序协同配合下，第二车间工人终于在2月20日单系统试制成功了含磷很低的矿粉。
    用贫矿选出低磷粉，仅仅是选矿工作的开始，因为当时单系统每小时只生产二吨矿粉，后来虽扩大到四个系统，日产量提高到一百七十吨，但还是不能满足生产的需要。如果继续用增添设备的办法增产低磷粉，势必要压缩当前产量，影响高炉正常出铁。于是，工人们在操作上系统地贯彻了杨春泽班工人创造的粉碎、磨细、多次选别的高浓度操作方法，不增添设备，而提高了低磷粉产量和质量，使精矿粉含铁量高达68.5％。
