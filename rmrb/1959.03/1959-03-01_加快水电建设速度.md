Accelerate the Pace of Hydropower Construction
Liang Lingguang, Vice Governor of Fujian Province

Fujian is a province characterized by rolling mountains, dense river networks, abundant rainfall, and rich hydropower resources. A preliminary survey of the major tributaries reveals a hydropower potential of over 6 million kilowatts. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, these water resources were never developed and utilized. After liberation, the Party and the government vigorously led the people in hydropower construction, transforming the landscape of the hydropower industry day by day. By the end of 1958, the province had completed and put into operation 262 hydropower stations, with an installed capacity more than 30 times that before liberation.

In recent years, in addition to actively building large-scale power stations, Fujian Province has also mobilized the masses to build small-scale hydropower stations extensively in rural areas. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, rural hydropower construction experienced a leap in development. The province built 154 new rural hydropower stations and 2,838 water power stations. Currently, each special zone is starting to build one or two medium-sized hydropower stations with a capacity of 10,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 kilowatts, each county is planning to build small hydropower stations with a capacity of about 100 to 1,000 kilowatts, and communes and below are building small hydropower stations ranging from one kilowatt to dozens of kilowatts. A power grid covering both urban and rural areas is taking shape.

In order to better serve industrial and agricultural production, we have adopted the principle of "water power first, then hydropower; processing first, then lighting" in the construction of small hydropower stations in rural areas. This makes it possible for people's communes to use water power and electricity extensively to process agricultural and sideline products, promoting the mechanization and semi-mechanization of rural small-scale industries and greatly saving labor and fuel. For example, after Jin Dou People's Commune in Yongchun County built five small hydropower stations and fifty-two small water power stations, it saved more than 166,000 labor days in grain and feed processing alone. After using water power to drive blowers instead of hand-pulled bellows in iron smelting furnaces, pig iron production increased tenfold. As the role of hydropower industry in the Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production becomes increasingly apparent, the broad masses have full confidence and soaring enthusiasm for rural "electrification," and they have proposed the bold slogan "Let the river water benefit mankind, and let the machines listen to the call of electricity!" Hydropower construction is progressing exceptionally rapidly. In Anxi County, more than 1,417 small water power stations and hydropower stations (including 13 hydropower stations) were built in just over a month last year, utilizing more than 8,000 horsepower of water energy. Yongchun County built 428 water power and hydropower stations last year, distributed in every corner of the county, which not only vigorously promoted the development of industry and agriculture throughout the county, but also brought light to the remote mountainous areas. The masses sang with joy: "Singing loudly and advancing together, boosting morale and surging to the sky, hydropower plants are built in every village, and a happy life lasts forever."

In the vigorous utilization of water resources, all regions have paid attention to the unified planning and comprehensive utilization of water resources, so that they can achieve the greatest benefits in flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power generation. The Taipingbei Water Conservancy Project in Putian implements the principle of multi-purpose and comprehensive utilization of water, forming eighteen levels of drop along the main canal for irrigation, processing, power generation, aquaculture and navigation, and using water power to run forty-three factories and some small field power stations, accelerating the industrialization of the commune and the mechanization of agriculture. Coastal areas of Fujian Province not only vigorously develop and utilize water resources, but also have begun to use biogas, wind power, and tidal power generation. There is inexhaustible potential in these areas.

The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the province has put increasingly urgent demands on electricity. We will make full use of Fujian's superior conditions of abundant water resources, large drops, small submergence losses, and generally good geological conditions to accelerate hydropower construction, so that "large ocean groups" can spread their wings and fly high, and "small local groups" can blossom everywhere, making the power industry truly become a well-deserved "pioneer" to promote the early realization of industrialization and rural electrification in Fujian, and also transmit part of the electricity to other provinces to meet the electricity needs of East China. We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and with the strong support of fraternal provinces and cities across the country, we will be able to successfully complete the grand task of hydropower construction throughout the province, and, like other parts of the country, ride the "electrification" steed in the near future and gallop towards a bright socialist and communist future.

    加快水电建设速度
    福建省副省长　梁灵光
    福建境内山峦起伏，水流密布，雨量充沛，水力资源十分丰富，经过普查的主要干支流，水能蕴藏量就有六百多万瓩。过去在国民党反动统治下，水力资源根本得不到开发利用。解放后，党和政府大力领导人民进行水电建设，水电工业面貌日新月异，到1958年底，全省建成并已开始发电的水电站有二百六十二个，装机容量为解放前的三十多倍。
    几年来，福建省在水电建设中，除了积极兴建大型电站以外，还发动群众在广大农村普遍兴建小型水力发电站。在大跃进的1958年，农村水电建设更获得了飞跃的发展，全省新建农村水电站一百五十四个，另外还新建了水力站二千八百三十八处。现在，每个专区都开始建设一两个一万到三、四万瓩的中型水电站，每个县都将举办一百到一千瓩左右的小水电站，公社以下则修建小到一个瓩、大到几十个瓩的水力水电站。一个遍布城乡的电力网正在形成中。
    为了更好地为工农业生产服务，我们在农村建设小型水电是采取先水力后水电、先加工后照明的方针。这就使人民公社有可能大量地采用水力电力加工农副产品，促进了农村小型工业的机械化和半机械化，大大节省了劳力和燃料。例如永春县锦斗人民公社建立五个小水电站和五十二个小水力站以后，仅粮食、饲料加工，就节省了十六万六千多个劳动日。炼铁炉使用水力带动鼓风机代替手拉风箱后，生铁产量提高了十倍。由于水电工业在工农业生产大跃进中发挥了日益明显的作用，广大群众对农村“水电化”信心百倍，干劲冲天，人们提出了“要河水为人类造福，叫机器听电力呼唤”的壮语，水电建设进展异常迅速。安溪全县去年在一个多月里，就办了小型水力站、水电站一千四百一十七处（其中水电站十三处），水能利用达到八千多马力。永春县去年兴建了四百二十八处水力水电站，它们分布在全县各个角落，不仅有力地推进了全县工农业的发展，而且使偏僻的山区大放光明，群众喜不自禁地歌唱道：“高歌猛进齐向前，鼓起干劲势冲天，村村办起水电厂，幸福生活万万年”。
    各地在大力利用水力资源中，都注意到了水力的统一规划和综合利用，使它在防洪、灌溉、航运、发电等方面都能够收到最大的效益。莆田太平陂水利工程，实行一水多用与综合利用的方针，沿干渠筑成十八级落差，进行灌溉、加工、发电、养殖和航运，并且以水力为动力兴办了四十三个工厂和部分田间小动力站，加速了公社工业化和农业机械化的发展。福建省沿海地区不仅大力开发和利用了水力资源，而且已开始利用沼气、风力和潮汐发电。在这些方面，还有取之不尽用之不竭的潜力。
    全省工农业生产大跃进对电力的要求已愈来愈迫切，我们将充分利用福建水力资源多、落差大、淹没损失小和地质情况一般良好的优越条件，加速水电建设，使“大洋群”展翅高飞，“小土群”遍地开花，使电力工业真正成为名副其实的“先行”，以促进福建工业化与农村电气化的早日实现，并将部分电力输送省外，供应华东地区用电的需要。我们相信，在党中央的领导和全国各兄弟省市的有力支援下，我们一定能够胜利地完成全省水电建设的宏伟任务，并和全国各地一样，在不久的将来跨上“电气化”的骏马，向美好的社会主义和共产主义飞奔前进。
