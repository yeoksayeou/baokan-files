Jilin Vigorously Prepares Land to Conserve Moisture and Prevent Drought

	Jilin Province has experienced very little rain and snow since last winter and this spring, and most of the land that was deeply plowed last year has not been leveled, so the soil is currently quite dry. In order to overcome the spring drought and ensure timely sowing, people's communes in various places have organized specialized teams to carry out land preparation and moisture conservation work. At present, in conjunction with the movement to accumulate, produce, and deliver fertilizer, various places have harrowed and compacted more than 3.4 million mu of land and irrigated more than 165,000 mu of land in spring. In order to accelerate the progress of land preparation, various places have rushed to manufacture more than 86,000 pieces of land preparation tools and created many advanced land preparation methods, improving the quality of land preparation.

Jiangxi Rushes to Transport Timber Down the Mountain

	Jiangxi's forest areas are seizing the great opportunity of the upcoming Taoxun (spring flood season) to step up the transportation of timber and bamboo. At present, the province has felled more than 1.7 million cubic meters of timber and 12.39 million mao bamboo stalks, most of which are still stored in the mountains. To this end, a number of laborers have been transferred to the mountainous areas to support the rush transportation. Various places have also launched a technical innovation movement centered on reforming tools and improving work efficiency. The wooden rail power index car created by the Huashan Branch Farm in Tonggu County can transport 160 cubic meters of timber per day, which is more than 100 times more efficient than manual flatbed carts.
