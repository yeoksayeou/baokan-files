Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th: Tokyo News: In an article published in the "Asahi Shimbun" today, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the Socialist Party will launch a strong national movement to urge the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to change its dangerous foreign policy in order to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Asanuma returned to Tokyo yesterday after leading a delegation of the Socialist Party to visit China.

In the article, Asanuma expressed his belief that the delegation's visit to China had reopened the path of people-to-people diplomacy and achieved great success.

Asanuma pointed out that for several years, in the absence of the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the people of the two countries had engaged in exchanges in trade and culture. However, subsequently, all of this was interrupted by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policy of hostility toward China. Asanuma pointed out that in this situation, it is only natural to adopt the position of advocating the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and confirming that political issues must be resolved before resolving economic issues between the two countries. In this regard, Asanuma pointed out that as long as the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet does not change its current dangerous foreign policy and does not show a sincere attitude towards restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the issue of Sino-Japanese relations cannot be resolved.

Asanuma said that during the delegation's visit to China, the Chinese government and the Chinese people expressed peaceful, friendly and cordial feelings towards the delegation, and through the delegation, towards the Japanese people. He pointed out that the Chinese people condemned American imperialism for pursuing an aggressive policy, occupying China's territory of Taiwan and Japan's Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands, and establishing military bases in these places. Asanuma said that he felt the same way about this.

Asanuma finally pointed out that the key to solving the issue of Sino-Japanese relations lies in the attitude of the Japanese government. He said that he believes that telling the Japanese people about this situation clearly and without any reservations is the significance of the Socialist Party delegation's visit to China. He pointed out that the key to Japan's future politics lies in its adoption of a friendly and good-neighborly policy towards People's China.

In his article, Asanuma also gave a detailed account of the rapid progress of China's socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th: Tokyo News: Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japan Socialist Party delegation to China, emphasized when answering questions from reporters at Tokyo Airport on the afternoon of the 23rd that regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, China's attitude is very clear: politics and economics cannot be separated, and political issues must be resolved first. The primary task is to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries, and people-to-people diplomacy should also begin with the restoration of diplomatic relations.

Asanuma pointed out that the expiration of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement and the stalemate in Sino-Japanese relations were "due to the unfriendly policy adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet towards China."

Speaking about the achievements of the Socialist Party delegation's visit to China, Asanuma pointed out that in the absence of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the delegation was able to arouse public opinion through people-to-people diplomacy, which was a great achievement. The talks held between the delegation and the Chinese side opened the way for people-to-people diplomacy, which had been interrupted.

Asanuma emphasized that efforts must be made to mobilize public opinion so that the Japanese people can force the Japanese government to change its policy. He also stated that he would continue to focus on political activities in the future.

In response to a question about his statement in Beijing on the 12th that "American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people," Asanuma reiterated that the Socialist Party would fight against imperialism internationally. He said that there was nothing wrong with his above-mentioned statement.

Asanuma also said that the joint statement he issued with Zhang Xiruo was a statement recording the consensus reached between the delegation and the Chinese side, not a unilateral statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th: Tokyo News: The Japan Socialist Party delegation to China held a report meeting in the square of Shinbashi Station in Tokyo today. More than a thousand citizens attended the rally and listened to the delegation's report.

Inejiro Asanuma, head of the delegation, emphasized at the meeting that Japan must sever its military alliance with the United States and take the road of developing friendly relations with China.

Asanuma said that China and the Chinese people hope to restore diplomatic relations with Japan as soon as possible, and similarly, the majority of Japanese people also urgently demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China. He severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of obstructing the realization of this desire of the people of the two countries.

Delegation members Seiichi Katsumada, Masaru Yone, Tadatake Sata, and Toshiya Nakasaki also spoke.

In their speeches, they unanimously condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, and at the same time stated that they would vigorously carry out a national movement to promote the early restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and they called on the Japanese people to support their efforts.

At today's report meeting, several thugs from right-wing groups sneaked into the venue and engaged in sabotage, distributing leaflets against the Socialist Party, but the shameless actions of the fascist thugs only aroused the anger of the audience.

    浅沼在东京发表文章和谈话指出
    岸信介政府打断中日两国交往
    恢复邦交必须先解决政治问题
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天在“朝日新闻”上发表文章说，社会党将展开强有力的国民运动，促使岸信介内阁改变它所执行的危险的外交政策，以便争取恢复日中邦交。
    浅沼在率领社会党代表团访问了中国以后，在昨天回到东京。
    浅沼在文章中表示相信，代表团这次对中国的访问重新开辟了国民外交的途径，获得了巨大成就。
    浅沼指出，几年来，在日中邦交还没有恢复的情况下，日中两国人民曾经在贸易和文化等方面进行了交流。但是，其后，这一切都被岸信介内阁的敌视中国的政策所打断。浅沼指出，在这种情况下，采取主张恢复日中邦交，并且确认在解决两国间的经济问题之前必须先解决政治问题的立场是理所当然的。在这方面，浅沼指出，只要岸信介内阁一天不改变它目前所执行的危险的外交政策，并且不对恢复日中邦交表示有诚意的态度，日中关系问题是不可能解决的。
    浅沼说，在代表团访问中国期间，中国政府和中国人民对代表团，并且通过代表团对日本人民表示了和平、友好的亲切感情。他指出，中国人民谴责美帝国主义执行侵略政策，侵占中国的领土台湾和日本的冲绳、小笠原群岛，并且在这些地方建立军事基地。浅沼说，他对于这一点抱有同感。
    浅沼最后指出，解决日中关系问题的关键在于日本政府的态度。他说，他认为，把这种情况明确地、毫无顾虑地告诉日本人民，这就是社会党代表团访问中国的意义。他指出，日本未来的政治的关键就在于它必须对人民中国采取友好、善邻的政策。
    浅沼在文章中还详细介绍了中国社会主义建设飞速进展的情况。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎23日下午在东京机场回答记者提出的问题时强调说，关于日中关系问题，中国的态度非常明确，不能把政治和经济分开，首先必须解决政治问题，首要的是恢复两国间的邦交，国民外交也应该首先从恢复邦交着手。
    浅沼指出，日中贸易协定失效，日中关系陷于僵局，是“由于岸信介内阁对中国采取了不友好的政策”。
    谈到社会党代表团访问中国的成果时，浅沼指出，在日中两国还没有恢复邦交的情况下，代表团能够通过国民外交来唤起舆论，这是它取得的很大的成果。代表团这次同中国方面举行的会谈为已经中断了的国民外交打开了道路。
    浅沼强调说，一定要努力发动舆论，以日本人民的力量促使日本政府改变政策。他并且表示，今后仍然要以政治为中心，进行活动。
    在答复有关他于12日在北京发表的关于“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人”的谈话的问题时，浅沼重申社会党在国际上要同帝国主义进行斗争。他说，他的上述谈话丝毫也没有错误。
    浅沼还说，他同张奚若发表的共同声明，是记载了代表团同中国方面的一致意见的声明，而不是单方面的声明。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党访华代表团今天在东京新桥车站的广场上举行了访华报告会。一千多名市民参加集会，倾听了代表团的报告。
    代表团团长浅沼稻次郎在会上强调指出，日本必须割断同美国的军事同盟关系，走同中国发展友好关系的道路。
    浅沼说，中国和中国人民希望尽速恢复同日本的邦交，与此相同，大多数日本人民也迫切要求恢复同中国的邦交。他严厉谴责了岸信介政府阻挠实现两国人民的这种愿望的政策。
  代表团团员胜间田清一、曾祢益、佐多忠隆和中崎敏也讲了话。
    他们在讲话中一致谴责岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，同时表示，他们将大力开展国民运动，以促使早日恢复日中邦交，他们并且号召日本人民支持他们的努力。
    在今天的报告会上，有几个右翼团体的暴徒潜入会场，进行捣乱，散发反对社会党的传单，但法西斯暴徒的无耻行动只引起了听众的愤怒。
