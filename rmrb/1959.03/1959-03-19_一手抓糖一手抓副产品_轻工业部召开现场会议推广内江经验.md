Grasp Sugar Production with One Hand, By-Products with the Other
Ministry of Light Industry Holds On-Site Meeting to Promote Neijiang Experience

Chengdu, March 18th (This newspaper dispatch) - Grasp sugar cane refining with one hand, by-products with the other; this was the topic that garnered the most interest from representatives attending the sugarcane comprehensive utilization on-site meeting held recently in Neijiang City by the Ministry of Light Industry, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Light Industry, and the CPC Neijiang Prefectural Committee. In the past, sugarcane and sugar beet refining only utilized a portion of their resources. If all of the by-products of sugarcane were utilized, the value of the by-products would exceed the value of sugar by two to three times.

The representatives attending the meeting earnestly studied the achievements of comprehensive sugarcane utilization in the Neijiang area. The experience of Neijiang Prefecture is: the secretary takes command, grasping sugar production with one hand and comprehensive utilization with the other. The specific method is to enable the broad masses of workers to recognize the benefits of comprehensive sugarcane utilization through vigorous airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters. At the same time, they also criticized the mysterious view that comprehensive sugarcane utilization involves organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and so on, thereby stimulating the masses' enthusiasm for innovation. As a result, a trial production upsurge of comprehensive sugarcane utilization was quickly launched with everyone contributing ideas and everyone participating. In just three months, the workers of the eight sugar factories in the district put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals and successfully trial-produced 132 new products. Among them, 21 products, such as paper, cardboard, sugarcane wax, citric acid, and furfural, quickly established factories and began mass production.

Adhering to both indigenous and foreign methods, and walking on two legs, is an important guarantee for the successful comprehensive utilization of sugarcane by various sugar factories in the Neijiang area. Their approach is: emphasizing first low then high, first small then large, first solving the problem of having or not having, then solving the problem of quantity. The Neijiang Sugar Factory originally planned to design a furfural factory with an annual output of 500 tons. The construction of such a factory requires 200 tons of steel. However, so much steel could not be made available at once, they did not wait, but adopted the method of "digging, finding, and substituting," tapping the potential of equipment and implementing multiple uses for one item; finding tricks, substituting wood and stone for steel and equipment. As a result, they built a furfural factory with a daily output of 50 kilograms in just over a month. Using the same method, they also set up comprehensive processing factories such as paper mills, glucose factories, citric acid factories, and acetone-butanol factories.

The meeting also focused on discussing the scope of comprehensive utilization of sugar factories, and what to grasp first and what to grasp later. The meeting believed that all regions should, under the premise of the country as a whole, mass-produce products needed by the state according to current technical conditions. Such as paper, acetone-butanol, sugarcane wax, glycerin, citric acid, etc.

More than 300 representatives from sugar industry departments from 14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the meeting.

### 一手抓糖一手抓副产品  轻工业部召开现场会议推广内江经验

    一手抓糖一手抓副产品
    轻工业部召开现场会议推广内江经验
    本报成都18日电　一手抓甘蔗榨糖，一手抓副产品，这是轻工业部、四川省轻工业厅和中共内江地委最近在内江市召开的甘蔗综合利用现场会议上到会代表最感兴趣的议题。过去，用甘蔗和甜菜榨糖，仅仅是利用了其中的一部分资源。如果将甘蔗的副产物全部利用起来，副产物的产值将超过糖的产值的二倍到三倍。
    到会代表认真地研究了内江地区甘蔗综合利用的成就。内江专区的经验是：书记挂帅，一手抓糖，一手抓综合利用。具体作法是通过大鸣大放大辩论，使广大职工认识到甘蔗综合利用的好处，同时还批判了那种认为甘蔗综合利用涉及到有机化学、高分子化学等等神秘观点，从而激发了群众的创造热情，结果，迅速掀起了一个人人献计，个个动手大搞甘蔗综合利用的试制高潮。在短短的三个月内，全区八个糖厂的职工，就提出了数万条合理化建议，并试制成功了一百三十二种新产品。其中纸张、纸板、蔗腊、柠檬酸、糠醛等二十一种产品，很快建成了工厂开始成批生产。
    土洋并举，用两条腿走路的方针，是内江地区各糖厂综合利用甘蔗获得成功的重要保证。他们的作法是：强调先低后高，先小后大，先解决有无的问题，后解决多少的问题。内江糖厂原计划设计一个年产五百吨的糠醛厂，建设这样一个工厂，需要二百吨钢材。可是，一时拿不出这么多的钢材，他们并没有等待，采取了“挖、找、代”的办法，挖掘设备潜力，实行一物多用；找窍门，以木头、石头代替钢材、器材。结果，只花了一个多月的时间，就建成了一个日产五十公斤的糠醛厂。用同样的办法，他们还办起了纸厂，葡萄糖厂，柠檬酸厂，丙酮丁醇厂等综合加工工厂。
    会议还着重讨论了糖厂综合利用的立围和先抓什么后抓什么的问题。会议认为各地应在全国一盘棋的前提下，按目前技术条件，大量生产国家需要的产品。如纸张、丙酮丁醇、蔗腊、甘油、柠檬酸等。
    出席这次会议的有十四个省、市、自治区的三百多名制糖工业部门的代表。
