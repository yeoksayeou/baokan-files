Women on All Fronts Across the Country Widely Launch Competitions
    Dedicating New Achievements in Production and Work to "March 8th"

    (Reported by this newspaper) Recently, women on all fronts across the country have widely launched production competitions, creating many new achievements in production and work to dedicate to the "March 8th" International Women's Day.

    Female workers on the industrial front in various regions have launched a wave of competition centered on vigorously promoting technological innovation and increasing labor productivity. Female workers in Shanghai proposed to work hard and cleverly, with everyone participating and everyone contributing ideas, to dedicate their practical actions to "March 8th." Encouraged by this slogan, more than 200,000 female textile workers in the city enthusiastically launched the "Learn from Experts, Catch up with Experts, and Learn to be Multiskilled" movement. Female workers at the Shanghai China Machine Tool Factory began their activities to greet the festival at the end of January. Female workers in four workshops enthusiastically launched a competition, and they challenged the female workers at the Great China Pen Factory. After the female workers at the Great China Pen Factory accepted the challenge, everyone brainstormed to find materials to ensure the completion of 35 innovation projects before the festival. Female workers in many factories in Beijing launched "Tribute Week" activities before the festival, using their outstanding production achievements to dedicate to the festival. After female workers in cotton textile factories in Tianjin launched a wave of learning from experts and catching up with experts, many new female experts have emerged. Female workers on the industrial front in Guangzhou also focused on vigorously promoting technological revolution and tackling raw materials and equipment, carrying out the "Female Expert" movement.

    The broad masses of rural women, with soaring enthusiasm, have made outstanding achievements in the spring plowing production movement centered on accumulating fertilizer, dedicating to "March 8th." In Liaoning Province, women participating in fertilizer accumulation account for more than half of the total number of fertilizer accumulators. According to preliminary statistics from 26 counties including Gaiping, Jin County, Xinmin, Jianchang, Lingyuan, and Shenyang, more than 720,000 women have been organized, becoming an important force in the battle of accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer. Rural women in Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, Ningbo, Zhoushan and other regions of Zhejiang Province put forward the slogans "Accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating grain" and "One load of fertilizer, one load of grain," actively engaging in the vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement. The women of Yunzhou West Village, Shanxi Province, the hometown of revolutionary heroine Liu Hulan, put forward the slogan of vigorously developing fertilizer to welcome "March 8th" in January this year. So far, the 133 women participating in fertilizer accumulation in this village have accumulated more than 150,000 loads of various fertilizers, accounting for 70% of the village's total fertilizer accumulation. In order to achieve a greater harvest of summer crops, rural women in various regions are also actively engaged in field management. Women in Nanchuan County, Sichuan Province, proposed to manage more than 1,000 mu of women's high-yield fields and more than 3,600 women's wheat bumper harvest plots, to ensure the realization of the target of 5,000 jin per mu for wheat high-yield fields and 3,000 jin per mu for wheat bumper harvest plots, to start the first battle of the summer harvest.

    全国各个战线上的妇女广泛开展竞赛
    用新的生产和工作成绩向“三八”献礼
    本报讯　最近时期以来，全国各个战线上的妇女广泛展开了生产竞赛，创造了许多新的生产和工作成绩，向“三八”国际妇女节献礼。
    各地工业战线上的女职工，展开了以大闹技术革新，提高劳动生产率为中心的竞赛热潮。上海市的女职工们提出，苦干加巧干，个个动手，人人献计，以实际行动向“三八”节献礼。全市二十多万纺织女工在这一口号鼓舞下，热烈展开了“学能手，赶能手，学习多面手”运动。上海中国机械工具厂的女工们，在1月底就开始了迎接节日的献礼活动。四个车间的女职工热烈地展开了竞赛，她们并向大陆金笔厂的女工挑战，大陆金笔厂的女工应战以后，人人动脑筋找材料，保证在节日以前完成三十五个革新项目。北京市许多工厂女工在节日前展开了“献礼周”活动，用她们出色的生产成绩向节日献礼。天津市各棉纺织厂女工掀起学能手、赶能手的热潮以后，已涌现出许多新的女能手。广州市工业战线上的女职工也围绕着大闹技术革命，猛攻原料关和设备关等工作，开展“女能手”运动。
    广大农村妇女以冲天的干劲，在以积肥为中心的备耕生产运动中做出了优异的成绩，向“三八”节献礼。辽宁省参加积肥的妇女，占积肥总人数的一半以上。据盖平、金县、新民、建昌、凌源、沈阳等二十六个县的初步统计，已有七十二万多名妇女组织起来，在积肥、造肥、送肥战斗中成为一支重要的力量。浙江省温州、嘉兴、金华、宁波、舟山等地区的农村妇女，提出“积肥如积粮”、“一担肥、一担粮”的口号，积极投入了轰轰烈烈的积肥运动。革命女英雄刘胡兰烈士的故乡——山西省云周西村的妇女，今年1月间就提出了大搞肥料迎接“三八”节的口号，到目前为止，这个村参加积肥的一百三十三个妇女已积各种肥料十五万多担，占全村积肥总数的70％。为了使夏收作物获得更大的丰收，各地农村妇女还积极投入田间管理工作。四川省南川县妇女提出要管好一千多亩妇女高产田和三千六百多个妇女小麦丰产片，保证实现小麦高产田亩产五千斤和小麦丰产片亩产三千斤的指标，打响夏收第一炮。
