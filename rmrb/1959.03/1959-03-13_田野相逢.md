    Encounter in the Field
    Huang Qian
    The fog was especially thick today, and you couldn't see anyone on the other side. By the time the Third Squad assembled to go to the fields, it was already six o'clock in the morning, but the sky was still dark.

    As soon as the squad leader had assigned the task of continuing to dig fertilizer cellars to the commune members, the eager young men started working with their shovels.

    Just then, the sound of a cart bell came from the west side of the road, jingling and jangling. The commune's carts had all gone elsewhere to deliver fertilizer, so where did this cart team come from? The squad leader was wondering when a man suddenly rushed out of the fog: "Excuse me, is there a responsible comrade from the commune here?" The squad leader took a closer look and realized it was a soldier. Behind him was a long line of carts. He pondered for a moment and immediately understood, and happily went up to shake the soldier's hand: "Your troops are here to support us with fertilizer, right? I represent our commune in expressing our gratitude!"

    The soldier was about to ask the squad leader something, but after sizing up the squad leader, he recognized him: "Aren't you Deputy Minister Liu from the Provincial Party Committee? How did you get here!"

    "Don't call me that, I'm just a squad leader in the Taiyang Commune now." "Oh, I remember, you are Comrade Zhu Xinsheng, the model of cherishing the people? Right, right, that time I gave a report, you asked me a lot of questions… You still recognize me, haha!"

    In the meantime, the commune members and soldiers had gathered together, asking questions and chatting like old friends. But one soldier with graying temples stood silently to the side, sizing up the squad leader. His actions also attracted the squad leader's attention. Suddenly, they both exclaimed almost simultaneously: "It's you!" The two men immediately grasped hands tightly, shaking them vigorously; two pairs of eyes that had both worn reading glasses stared at each other, searching the corners of each other's eyes and temples. The squad leader spoke first: "You've also become a private! Looking at your hair, it's already graying..."

    "Old Liu, when did you come down? Were you in the first group? Still the same old temperament, always taking the lead in responding to the call! We, um—haven't seen each other in ten years or so! Have you been in the Provincial Party Committee all the time?"

    Zhu Xinsheng interjected: "Minister Liu, you used to know our Deputy Commander, I was even preparing to introduce you!"

    "No need to introduce us, we are old comrades-in-arms. Ten years ago he was a regimental commander and I was a political commissar; even earlier, he was a battalion commander and I was a political instructor."

    Someone suggested: "Please, two leaders, tell us a story!" A burst of applause followed. The general said: "Tell, tell, I have to have a good talk with your Minister Liu. But not now, we have to observe labor discipline, right?" The commune members burst into laughter. The old private turned around: "Squad leader comrade, where should we unload the twenty cartloads of fertilizer?" The squad leader said: "Unload them on the spot. Young men, let's get to work!"

    As he spoke, the two old comrades-in-arms looked at each other, rolled up their sleeves, and picked up their shovels. The fog gradually dissipated, and the sun shone on the fields. In the early spring sunshine, this pair of old comrades-in-arms worked as energetically as the young men.

    田野相逢
    黄谦
    今天的雾特别大，对面都看不见人。第三小队集合下地的时候，已经是早上六点钟了，可是天还是黑沉沉的。
    小队长刚给社员布置好今天继续挖肥窖的任务后，性急的小伙子就抡起铁锨干起来了。
    就在这时候，路西边传来了大车的铃声，叮叮当当的。社里的车都去别处送肥去了，哪来的车队呢？小队长正纳闷，从雾中突然冲出一个人来：“请问你们这里有公社负责同志吗？”小队长仔细一看，发现是一个军人，他后面停了一长溜大车。他琢磨一下，立刻明白了，高兴地迎上去握住了那军人的手：“你们部队是送肥来支援咱们的吧？我代表咱们公社表示感谢！”
    军人正想问小队长什么话，但把小队长一打量，他认出来了：“您不是省委刘副部长吗？怎么到了这儿！”
    “别这么叫，我现在是太阳公社的小队长哩。”“哦，想起来了，你是爱民模范朱新生同志吗？对对对，我那次做报告你问过我不少问题，……你倒还认得我，哈哈！”
    说话之间，社员和战士们已经围在一起问长问短，好像熟朋友了。可是有一个鬓发斑白的战士却一声不吭，站在一边对小队长直打量。他的行动也引起了小队长的注意。忽然，他们几乎同时叫了起来：“是你呀！”两个人的手马上紧紧地握到一起，一个劲地摇晃着；两对都戴过老花眼镜的眼睛互相凝视着，在对方的眼角、鬓角搜索着。还是小队长先开口：“你也当了列兵！看你的头发已经花白……”
    “老刘，什么时候下来的？是第一批吗？还是老脾气，响应号召总是走在前面！咱们，嗯——有十来年没见啦！你一直在省委？”
    朱新生插了一句：“刘部长，你同咱们副军长原来认识，我还准备给你们介绍哩！”
      “不用你介绍罗，咱们是老战友，十年前他是团长我是政委，再早他当营长我当教导员。”
    不知哪个社员提议：“请两位首长给我们讲个故事吧！”随着响起了一片掌声。将军说：“讲讲讲，我同你们刘部长得好好谈谈。可是现在不行，得遵守劳动纪律，对不对？”社员们一阵笑。老列兵转过身来：“小队长同志，我们送来二十大车肥料倒在什么地方？”小队长说：“就地卸下。小伙子们，咱们动手吧！”
    说着，两个老战友互相看了一眼，卷起袖子，拿起了铁锹。雾渐渐散去，太阳照射着田野。在初春的朝阳下，这一对老战友干得和年轻人一样的有劲。
