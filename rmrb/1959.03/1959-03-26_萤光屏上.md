    On the Television Screen
    Li Yichuan
    (I)
    The British, upon meeting, immediately talk about the weather: "The weather is very good today," or sometimes "The weather is really terrible today." But in recent years, a new element has been added to these greetings: "Did you watch television yesterday?" People are widely discussing television; while walking on the streets, you often hear catchphrases commonly used in television broadcasts, or those decadent tunes. Television is spreading its corrupting influence among the people on an unprecedented scale. In 1947, only 0.2% of the population watched television, and there was only one television station, the British Broadcasting Corporation; but in the past five or six years, especially after 1955, Britain added another television station—"Independent Television," and the audience rapidly increased from 80,000 in 1947 to more than 22.2 million in 1957. If children are included, by the end of 1958, approximately two-thirds of the British population were watching television. Each television station broadcasts for an average of more than fifty-five hours a week, that is, eight hours a day, with the television station constantly pouring out its programs. The bourgeoisie is always boasting about its "Western civilization," and we may as well get a taste of it.
    (II)
    Movies and dramas occupy a large proportion of television broadcasts: almost half of the broadcast time, and the themes of these movies and dramas are mostly detective stories, murders, pornography, robberies, crimes, and wars. The following are a few programs from "Independent Television" on December 17th of last year, picked at random:
    5:25—5:55 PM: (Children's Program) The Adventures of Rong Dingding: The protagonist is wanted for murder; 6:10—6:40 PM: African Patrol: Murder brings love; 7:30—8:00 PM: Murder Handbag: Murder story; 8:00—10:00 PM: A pornographic play; 11:30 PM: Private detective Kang Martin is hired by an American insurance company to investigate a murder case.
    At least four movies and dramas of this nature are desperately and continuously broadcast on television every week. The Western mercenary writers say that only in this way can people be provided with the necessary "stimulation" and "excitement."
    The bourgeoisie's hysteria has reached its peak, coupled with the usual incessant clamoring of the entire propaganda machine about the Cold War, as if war is about to break out at any moment, which puts people's nerves in a state of extreme tension. An incident that caused a sensation in London happened in February:
    "Independent Television" suddenly announced that an enemy airship carrying an atomic bomb was hovering over London, and in an instant, London would be turned to ashes, and that the Prime Minister was holding a cabinet meeting to discuss countermeasures... People took it seriously, and some people were so frightened that they fainted. Many people spread the word, thinking that the end of mankind was coming. Only a few minutes later did they realize that this was just the beginning of a drama.
    None of the characters in these movies and dramas are mentally normal; they are all pale, weak, and mindless characters, arguing endlessly over trivial matters every day. Crazy, hooligans, jealous, nothing is too bizarre!
    There are also a large number of so-called "light entertainment" programs on television, including lewd songs and dances. Bizarre voices sing "I love you..." today, and "I love you..." tomorrow. The bourgeoisie has brought all kinds of weird dances to television: from "swing dance" to the latest "kaka," and there are also many unnamed leg dances. Now there is only one dance that has not been brought to television—the nude dance. In addition to these lewd songs and dances, there is also a kind of extremely boring "game" that uses the lure of money to attract the audience, such as "stroke the portrait," "ask me another question," and "multiply your money."
    In capitalist society, everything is commercialized, and everything serves the god of money. Commercialization in television has also reached an extremely high level. Independent Television has a few minutes of commercial advertising every fifteen minutes, called "natural rest." Often there are such situations: a beautiful girl comes out to dance, and people must think this is part of the program. But in the end, this girl advises you to buy "Naks" brand soap. Western countries often hold beauty contests, and after being selected as the most beautiful woman, the first task is often to do advertisements.
    After performing "light" programs, comes the "serious" ones. These types of programs include: news, question discussions, interviews, etc. But this trick of "freedom of speech" often reveals its flaws. The distortion of right and wrong in the news is world-famous. Question discussions seem "free," but in reality: the participants are selected and given various restrictions. When the British Broadcasting Corporation organized a "discussion" on "Marxism and Communism," the participants were all anti-communist experts, and in the one hundred and eighty minutes of discussion, only four minutes were given to communists to speak. The Deputy Chairman of the British Communist Party, Du De, exposed this hypocritical deception of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The famous British commentator Magruich said in his article "The Days I Spent with the British Broadcasting Corporation": "Many gentlemen, journalists, writers, politicians, and other public figures who attend British Broadcasting Corporation programs are easily tempted to say flattering words. They need or like the fee; from a professional point of view, appearing on British Broadcasting Corporation programs is also beneficial. In this way, they are not difficult to control. If someone does not listen...he will be fired."
    Bourgeois politicians are also paying more and more attention to the value of television as a propaganda tool. "A politician would need thirty-five years to speak directly to a considerable audience every night to equal one evening of television." The Labor Party threatened that in the next election, they would "fight the decisive battle on television," and dozens of members of parliament are already preparing to go into battle.
    (III)
    Television, a product of human wisdom, is being used by the bourgeoisie as a tool to poison the minds of kind people. Some British people call television a "huge monster." Under the influence of this "monster" and other various "monsters," more than eleven thousand people in Britain embark on the path of crime every week, and the vast majority of them are young people.
    This "monster" has become a "god of wealth" for another group of people. At the same time as the rising crime wave, profits are soaring. Last year, Independent Television's profits were 22,350% of the investment in 1955. The television screen has become a golden screen for printing money.
    These profits, as usual, flow into the pockets of a few monopoly capitalists. Because the giants that control television are also the tycoons that monopolize newspapers, movies, theaters, and the electrical industry. Harold Tritton, director of the British Electrical Industry, Locke, director of the largest movie monopoly group in Britain, and the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail groups are all the backstage bosses of Independent Television. At the same time, this small group of people also decides what should be performed.

    萤光屏上
    李一川
    （一）
    英国人见面后一开口便谈天气：“今天天气很好”，有时是“今天天气实在糟糕”。但近几年来人们的这种见面话中又增加了一个新的内容：“你看过昨天的电视吗？”人们广泛地在谈论着电视；在街道行走时，你常常会听到电视广播中惯用的口头语，或者是那种靡靡的曲调。电视在人民中间在史无前例的规模上散发着腐朽的影响。1947年时，看电视的人只不过人口中的0.2％，电视台也只有英国广播公司一个；但近五、六年来，特别是在1955年后，英国又增加了一个电视台——“独立电视台”，观众迅速地从1947年的八万人增长到1957年的两千二百余万人。如果把儿童算在内，到1958年底止，大约英国人口的三分之二以上都在看电视。每个电视台一星期播送的时间平均都在五十五个小时以上，就是说每天有八个小时，电视台不断地倾泻出它的节目。资产阶级总是吹嘘自己的“西方文明”，我们也不妨领略一番。
    （二）
    电影和戏剧在电视播送节目中占着很大的比例：几乎占去播送时间的一半，而这些电影和戏剧的主题绝大部分都是侦探、谋杀、色情、抢劫、犯罪和战争。下面是随便翻到的去年12月17日“独立电视台”的几个节目：
    五点二十五—五点五十五：（儿童节目）荣丁丁的冒险故事：主人翁因犯了谋杀罪而遭到通缉；六点十分—六点四十：非洲巡逻：谋杀带来了爱情；七点三十—八点：谋杀手提包：谋杀故事；八点—十点：一部色情戏；十一点三十分：私人侦探康·马丁，受美国一个保险公司的聘请，调查谋杀案件。
    每星期至少有四部这种性质的电影和戏剧拼命地连续地在电视台上向外播送。西方的雇佣文人们说：只有这样才能提供给人们以必要的“刺激”和“兴奋”。
    资产阶级的这种歇斯底里狂发作到了登峰造极的程度，再加上平时整套宣传机器不停地叫嚷冷战，好像战争随时有一触即发之势，这使得人们的神经处于极度紧张状态中。2月份曾经发生过这样一件轰动伦敦的事情：
    “独立电视台”忽然宣布携带有原子弹的敌人空中飞船，高悬伦敦上空，瞬息之间，伦敦会化为灰烬，并说首相正在开内阁会议讨论对策云云……。人们信以为真，顿时有人就被吓得昏过去了。许多人奔走相告，以为人类末日之将至。几分钟之后，才发现这只不过是一个戏剧的开头。
    这些电影和剧中的人物，没有一个人的精神是正常的，都是些惨白无力、无头无脑的人物，每日为琐碎事争吵个不休。疯疯癫癫，阿飞流氓，争风吃醋，无奇不有！
    电视上还有大量的所谓“轻松的娱乐”节目，其中包括淫荡的歌曲和舞蹈。离奇古怪的嗓子今天唱的是“我爱你……”，明天还是“我爱你……”。资产阶级把各种奇形怪状的舞都搬上电视了：从“摇摆舞”到最新式的“卡卡”，并且还有许多没有名堂的大腿舞。现在只有一种舞还未搬上电视——裸体舞。除过这些淫荡的歌曲和舞蹈之外，还有一种穷极无聊的“游戏”，用金钱的诱惑力来吸引观众，像“划人像”、“再问我一个问题”、“把你的钱加一番”。
    在资本主义社会，一切都是商业化，一切都在为金钱这个上帝服务，电视中的商业化也达到了极高度。独立电视每十五分钟就要来一次几分钟的商业广告，名之曰“自然的休息”。往往有这样一些情形：一个漂亮的姑娘出来跳一番舞，人们一定以为这是节目中的一项。但最后这位姑娘劝告你买“纳克斯”牌的肥皂。西方国家常常举行美女比赛，被选为最美的美女之后，第一个差使往往是作广告。
    表演过“轻松”之后来“严肃”的。这类节目如：新闻、问题讨论、访问等。但是这种“言论自由”的把戏常常露出马脚来。新闻的颠倒黑白是世界闻名的。问题讨论看起来似乎“自由”，但是实际上：参加讨论的人员是经过挑选的，并且给以各种限制。英国广播公司组织“讨论”“马克思主义与共产主义”时，参加的人都是反共专家，在一百八十分钟的讨论中，只给共产党员四分钟的发言时间。英国共产党副主席杜德揭露了英国广播公司的这种虚伪的欺骗作法。英国著名的评论家马格瑞奇在他的“我同英国广播公司相处的日子”一文中说：“出席英国广播公司节目的许多绅士、新闻记者、作家、政治家和其他公众活动家很容易被引诱去说恭维话。他们需要或者喜欢那批酬费；从职业的观点来说，在英国广播公司节目中出现也是有好处的。这样他们就不难被控制了。假如有人不听话……，他就会被开除掉”。
    资产阶级的政客们也越来越注意电视这个宣传工具的价值了。”一个政治家每天晚上直接向一个相当规模的听众讲话，需用三十五年的时间才能顶得电视的一个晚上。”工党扬言下次选举时“要在电视台上决战”，现在已有好几十个议员准备整装上阵。
    （三）
    电视，这个人类智慧结晶的产物，却被资产阶级用来作为毒化善良人民心灵的工具了。有的英国人把电视称为“巨大的怪魔”。在这个“怪魔”和其他各种“怪魔”的影响之下，英国每周都有一万一千余人走上犯罪的道路，而且其中绝大部分都是青年人。
    这个“怪魔”对另一部分人来说变成了“财神爷”。与犯罪潮高涨的同时是利润的高涨。去年独立电视的利润是1955年投资的22，350％。萤光屏变成了印钞票的金光屏。
    这些利润照例是流入少数的几个垄断资本家口袋中了。因为控制电视的巨头也是垄断报纸、电影、剧院和电气工业的大亨。英国电气业董事哈罗德·崔顿、英国最大的电影垄断集团董事罗克、每日镜报、每日邮报集团都是独立电视的后台老板。同时也是这一小撮人决定应该演些什么。
