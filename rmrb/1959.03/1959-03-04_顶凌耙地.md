    Harrowing the Land During the Thaw
    Si Zhi
    Spring has arrived, and the hard clods of earth are softening, becoming as loose and moist as after a rain or watering. This is because the soil temperature rises in spring, and the water frozen between and within the soil particles begins to melt. The melted water rises along the capillary tubes between the soil particles, so there is more water on the soil surface. In agricultural terminology, this phenomenon is called "returning to slurry," and this period is called the "slurry return period."
    In North China, the slurry return period is generally from early March to early April. At this time, as the temperature rises, the amount of soil moisture evaporation gradually increases, and coupled with the windy conditions in the north in spring, the moisture rising to the soil surface along the capillaries evaporates quickly. In order to accumulate this moisture and reduce water loss, the old folks often have the custom of "harrowing the land during the thaw."
    Harrowing the land during the thaw refers to harrowing the land around early March, when the temperature is high during the day and the soil thaws, and the temperature is low at night and it freezes again, during this alternating freeze-thaw period. Harrowing the land during the thaw is a good way to conserve moisture in the spring. Harrowing the ground with a harrow can cut off the capillaries, inhibit the continued rise and evaporation of moisture from the lower layers of the soil, and accumulate moisture in the soil. This allows the winter wheat to still get some moisture during the spring drought season and grow well. There is an old saying, "water comes out of the hoe," which refers to the fact that by hoeing and harrowing, the capillaries are cut off, and the soil moisture is retained, as if water really came out of the hoe and harrow.
    Therefore, harrowing the land during the thaw in the early stage of the slurry return cannot be missed as an agricultural season.

    顶凌耙地

    春天到了，坚硬的土块变松软了，像下过一场雨或浇过水一样，湿漉漉的。这是因为春天土壤温度升高了，土粒之间和土粒内结成冰的水开始融解了，融解了的水就沿着土粒间的毛细管上升，所以土地表面的水就多起来。这种现象农业上术语称为“返浆”，这个时期称“返浆期”。
    返浆期在华北一般是3月初至4月上旬。这时随着气温升高，土壤水分蒸发量逐渐增大，加上北方春天多风，所以沿着毛细管上升到土表的水分很快就会蒸发掉。为了积蓄这些水分，减少水分损失，老乡往往有“顶凌耙地”的习惯。
    顶凌耙地就是指的在3月上旬左右，白天温度高土壤化了冻，晚上温度低又结上冻，在这个冻融交替的时候来耙地。顶凌耙地是一种春季保墒的好方法。用耙耙了地面，可切断毛细管，抑制土壤下层水分继续上升蒸发掉，而把水分积蓄在土内，这样可以使春旱季节冬小麦还能得到一些水分而生长良好。有句农谚“锄头上出水”就是指的通过锄地、耙地，切断了毛细管，保持了土壤水分，好像锄、耙上真的出了水。
    所以，在返浆初期顶凌耙地是不能误过的农时。
