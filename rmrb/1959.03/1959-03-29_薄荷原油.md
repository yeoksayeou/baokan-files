    Peppermint Oil
    Peppermint oil is a volatile oil extracted from peppermint stems and leaves through distillation. The white, needle-like or prismatic crystals extracted from peppermint oil are called menthol. The remaining oil is called dementholized oil.
    Peppermint is a perennial herb that grows in the mountains and fields and can also be cultivated in fields. Peppermint is highly adaptable to climate and soil, and can be planted in dry land and wasteland, but it is most suitable for sandy soil and cool climates. China's peppermint is mainly produced in Jiangsu Province, with an annual output of more than 10,000 dan of peppermint oil. Anhui, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces also have small amounts of production.
    Peppermint stems and leaves are cool and mild in nature, and have the functions of promoting sweating, dispelling wind-heat, relieving depression, and treating typhoid fever. Menthol and dementholized oil are important raw materials for medicine, food, and cosmetics industries. Menthol and dementholized oil are also one of China's important export commodities.

    薄荷原油
    薄荷原油，是从薄荷茎叶中蒸馏而得的一种挥发性油。从薄荷原油中提制的白色针状或棱柱状结晶体叫薄荷脑。所剩余的油叫薄荷素油。
    薄荷是多年生草本植物，生长在山野上，也可培植在田圃间。薄荷对气候土壤的适应性很大，旱地荒园都可以种植，但以砂质土壤和气候温凉地带最适宜。我国的薄荷主要产于江苏省，每年可产薄荷原油一万多担，安徽、广东、江西、湖南等省也有少量生产。
    薄荷茎叶性凉散、温和，有发汗散风热、解郁治伤寒的功能，薄荷脑和薄荷素油是重要医药和食品、化妆工业原料。薄荷脑薄荷素油也是我国重要的出口商品之一。（附图片）
