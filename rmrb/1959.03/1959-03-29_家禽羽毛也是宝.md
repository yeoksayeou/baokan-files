Poultry farming not only provides people with meat and eggs but also with valuable poultry feathers. Goose and duck feathers, as well as goose and duck down, have been traditional export commodities for China for decades. China ranks first in the world in terms of both quantity and quality of exported goose and duck feathers and down. Goose and duck feathers are very valuable in foreign markets; in terms of value, one ton of duck feathers can be exchanged for a tractor, and two tons of goose feathers are worth three trucks with a load capacity of four to five tons.

Poultry feathers can also be used to make fans, shuttlecocks, etc. Although chicken feathers from poultry are not of high economic value, they are the main raw material for making daily necessities such as feather dusters and bellows pistons.

    家禽羽毛也是宝
    养鸡、鸭、鹅不仅可以使人们得到肉和蛋品，同时还可以得到用处很大的家禽羽毛。鹅鸭毛和鹅鸭绒是我国几十年来传统出口的一种商品。我国出口的鹅鸭毛和鹅鸭绒的数量质量都占世界第一位。鹅、鸭毛在国外市场上很值钱，以价值计算，一吨鸭毛可以换回一部拖拉机，二吨鹅毛的价值相等载重四至五吨的卡车三辆。
    家禽羽毛还可以制做扇子、羽毛球等。家禽羽毛中的鸡毛经济价值虽然不高，但是制做日用必需品毛帚和风箱屜子的主要原料。
