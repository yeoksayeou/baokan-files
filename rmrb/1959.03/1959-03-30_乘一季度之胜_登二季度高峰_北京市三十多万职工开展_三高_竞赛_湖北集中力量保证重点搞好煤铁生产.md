Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Representatives from factories, mines, and transportation enterprises in the capital held a Red Flag Competition Conference on the 28th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all city employees to immediately launch a "Three Highs" competition movement—high output, high quality, and high efficiency—to seize the second quarter, a crucial period for production and transportation, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

Beijing's industrial leap forward this year is substantial. On top of doubling the total output value last year, the goal is to further leap forward by more than half, with the output of major products like steel, iron, steel materials, coal, and major machinery doubling or even increasing several times over. Chemicals, textiles, light industry, and other sectors are also expected to leap forward simultaneously. The situation in the first quarter, where industrial output value exceeded planned targets month after month, indicates a good start on the industrial front. However, the larger and more arduous production tasks lie in the subsequent quarters. Launching the "Three Highs" competition movement aims to further mobilize the masses, adhere to the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and advance relentlessly to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan.

Seven thousand representatives of workers, cadres, and technicians participated in today's conference, and over 300,000 employees listened to the live broadcast of the conference in factories and mines. The venue was filled with challenge letters and pledges brought by workers after repeated discussions, outlining their proposed competition conditions and specific measures to achieve them. The voices of speakers on the stage were often drowned out by thunderous applause, and workers listening to the broadcast off-site wrote letters or made phone calls to express their soaring enthusiasm.

At this spirited competition conference, Jia Ting-san, Director of the Industrial Production Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report on launching the "Three Highs" competition, elaborating on the methods for implementing "Three Highs" and the approaches for conducting the "Three Highs" competition.

The report proposed the following methods for achieving "Three Highs": Based on mobilizing the masses, vigorously promote technical revolution and tap into the internal potential of enterprises. He pointed out that the spearhead of the technical revolution should first target unreasonable technological regulations in current production, improve operational methods and processing methods; secondly, gradually realize semi-mechanization, mechanization, and semi-automation, automation in the production process, eliminate heavy manual labor, and gradually replace manual operations that can be replaced, in order to reduce manpower and increase labor productivity; thirdly, save raw materials and adopt alternative materials, after testing and ensuring product quality. In the technical revolution, it is necessary to give play to the role of technical personnel and correctly combine technical personnel, workers, and cadres. The report cited many examples illustrating the great potential within enterprises. As long as the masses are mobilized to tap into it, and at the same time strengthen the allocation and adjustment work between enterprises, there is much to be gained in this regard.

The report proposed the following methods for carrying out the "Three Highs" competition: Organize assessments based on the requirements of "Three Highs." In industrial production, compare output, quality, efficiency, cost, and safety; in transportation, compare high loading, fast turnaround, low cost, good service, and fewer accidents. Among various industries, types of work, workshops within enterprises, groups, and individuals, comparable targets should be identified based on their own circumstances, and assessments should be organized. The report listed advanced technical experience indicators from various industries across the country and compared them with the indicators of similar industries in Beijing, demanding that factories and mines rapidly catch up.

The report also pointed out the importance of providing specific leadership for the competition. He required that each factory, mine, workshop, and group develop a product progress schedule and a daily progress schedule for important products, and around these progress schedules, develop supporting product progress schedules and progress schedules for the implementation of important measures, inspecting the product progress and the implementation of measures every ten days and every day.

Following Jia Ting-san's report, representatives from sixteen units in steel, coal, machinery, textiles, and transportation, among other sectors, took the stage to speak.

Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proposed more than two thousand technical measures in March, and the output of steel and steel materials completed the first quarter's plan twenty-four days and five days ahead of schedule, respectively. Their representative guaranteed at the meeting: this year's production will be 200,000 tons of steel; 750,000 tons of pig iron, striving to reach 850,000 tons. Representatives of the Muchengjian Coal Mine, which is currently engaged in a high-yield, high-quality coal production battle, guaranteed an annual output of 1.5 million tons of coal, striving to reach 1.75 million tons, with an all-employee efficiency of 2.5 tons of coal produced per person per day. Currently, the mine's employees are carrying out a technical revolution movement centered on a large-area bumper harvest, fighting to achieve a double bumper harvest in coal mining and tunneling. While proposing combat indicators, representatives from each unit also put forward specific measures to achieve the indicators.

The conference concluded by calling on all city employees to take swift action and "stay ahead of time." The entire audience repeatedly shouted, "Opportunity knocks but once," expressing their determination to immediately launch a new production upsurge that is even more magnificent than the first quarter, and to greet "May Day" with even better production and transportation achievements.

Xinhua News Agency: Hubei Province made early arrangements for industrial production tasks in the second quarter and put forward many specific measures to ensure the completion of this task.

The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is currently holding a meeting of industrial secretaries of party committees at all levels. The output of key products such as steel, iron, and coal assigned at the meeting for the second quarter is generally more than double the actual output in the first quarter, and the production tasks for steel materials, refractory materials, and wood have also greatly increased. The meeting believes that it is necessary to further implement the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," making it the guiding ideology for all enterprises and employees in the province, and to complete the state plan in every possible way. Local enterprises must strive to support key central enterprises.

The meeting decided to first concentrate efforts on doing a good job in coal and iron production. Hubei Province has a certain capacity for steelmaking equipment. The key issue at present is the need for sufficient steelmaking pig iron, and the key to pig iron production lies in the supply of coking coal. Currently, the state of the coal industry in the province is characterized on the one hand by a weak foundation and low output, and on the other hand by the inability to transport it out. Therefore, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to establish a coal headquarters specifically to strengthen leadership over coal production, transportation, distribution, and utilization. At the same time, the following measures were taken: (1) Accelerate the construction of key coal mines and the renovation of small coal kilns. Small coal kilns with convenient transportation, good resources, and capable of producing large quantities with slight modifications should be rapidly renovated and expanded, so that they can double their output in the near future. Relevant departments should give priority to the supply of machinery, pit props, explosives, etc., required for the renovation and expansion of small coal kilns. (2) Organize a professional coal transportation team, allocate hundreds of trucks, and take measures to keep the vehicles running while the drivers rest when necessary to make a concentrated effort to transport coal. (3) All departments using coal should try every possible means to reduce coal consumption. While doing a good job in coal production, relevant departments are required to accelerate the manufacture and support of metallurgical equipment. Metallurgical equipment that has been transported to construction sites should be quickly installed. The provincial metallurgical and mechanical departments will jointly establish inspection teams to inspect and supervise this work; vigorously mine ore and strengthen the management of ore distribution. Employees on the local metallurgical industry front should carry out the Red Flag competition well to ensure that steel is produced according to quality and quantity to complete the production plan.

The meeting required all localities to quickly clear warehouses, properly arrange labor, and ensure the production of key products. All localities are required to continue to vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, reform tools, improve labor organization, so as to improve labor productivity, save manpower, and reduce production costs.

    乘一季度之胜　登二季度高峰
    北京市三十多万职工开展“三高”竞赛
    湖北集中力量保证重点搞好煤铁生产
    据新华社29日讯　首都厂、矿、交通企业的代表在28日举行红旗竞赛大会，中共北京市委号召全市职工立即开展一个高产高质高效率的“三高”竞赛运动，抓紧第二季——生产、运输上的关键季度，实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    北京市今年工业跃进的步子很大，要在去年总产值增加一倍多的基础上，使总产值再跃进一半以上，主要产品钢、铁、钢材、煤主要机械的产量翻一番或者翻几番，化工、纺织、轻工业等也都要同时跃进。今年第一季度工业产值计划月月超额完成的情况，虽然表明工业战线上有了良好的开端，但更大、更艰巨的生产任务是在以后几个季度。交通运输业的情况大体也是这样。开展“三高”竞赛运动，就是要在进一步深入发动群众的基础上，按照多快好省的方针，一刻也不放松地乘胜前进，确保今年更大更好更全面的跃进计划完成和超额完成。
    有七千名工人、干部和技术人员的代表参加了今天的大会，还有三十多万职工在厂矿、企业收听了今天大会的实况广播。会场里贴着工人们带来的经过他们反复讨论过的挑战书和保证书，上面写着他们提出的竞赛条件和实现这些条件的具体措施。在台上讲话的人的声音常常被会场雷动的掌声所淹没，在场外收听广播的工人则纷纷写信或打电话来表示他们冲天的干劲。
    在这个群情奋发的竞赛大会上，中共北京市委工业生产委员会主任贾庭三代表市委作了关于开展“三高”竞赛的报告，报告阐述了实行“三高”的方法及开展“三高”竞赛的办法。
    报告中提出的实现“三高”的方法是：在发动群众的基础上，大闹技术革命，挖掘企业内部的潜力。他指出，技术革命的锋芒，首先应该指向目前生产中不合理的工艺规程，改进操作方法和加工方法；其次，要在生产过程中逐渐实现半机械化、机械化和半自动化、自动化，消灭笨重体力劳动，逐步代替可以代替的手工操作，以节减人力，提高劳动生产率；第三，在经过试验、保证产品质量的前提下，节约原材料，采用代用材料。在技术革命中，要发挥技术人员的作用，使技术人员、工人和干部正确地结合起来。报告列举了许多事例，说明企业内部的潜力是很大的。只要发动群众挖掘它，同时加强企业之间的调拨和调剂工作，在这方面将大有可为。
    报告中提出的开展“三高”竞赛的办法是：按照“三高”的要求，组织评比。在工业生产方面，比产量，比质量，比效率，比成本，比安全；在交通运输方面，比装载多，比周转快，比成本低，比服务好，比事故少。在各产业、工种之间，在企业内部的车间、小组、个人互相之间，都要按自己的情况寻找可比的对象，组织评比。报告列举全国各行各业的先进的技术经验指标，并把它同北京市同类行业的指标作了比较，要求各厂矿企业迅速赶上去。
    在报告中，还指出了对竞赛进行具体领导的重要性，他要求每个厂矿、车间、小组都要排出产品进度表和重要产品的日进度表，并围绕这些进度表排出配套产品进度表，重要措施实现的进度表，按旬按日检查产品进度措施实现的情况。
    贾庭三报告以后，钢铁、煤炭、机械、纺织、交通运输等方面的十六个单位的代表，相继登台发言。
    石景山钢铁公司工人在3月份提出了两千多项技术措施，钢材和钢的产量分别提前二十四天和五天完成了第一季度计划。他们的代表在会上保证：今年生产钢二十万吨；生铁七十五万吨，争取达到八十五万吨。正在进行高产优质夺煤大战的木城涧煤矿代表保证年产煤一百五十万吨，争取达到一百七十五万吨，全员效率每人每天产煤两吨半。现在这个矿的职工正在开展以大面积丰收为中心的技术革命运动，为争取实现采煤、掘进双丰收而斗争。各单位的代表在提出奋战指标的同时，都提出了实现指标的具体措施。
    大会最后号召全市职工迅速行动起来，“走在时间前面”。全场职工一再高呼：“机不可失，时不再来”，他们表示要立即掀起一个比第一季度规模更加壮阔的新的生产高潮，用更好的生产、运输成就迎接“五一”。
    新华社讯　湖北省及早安排第二季度工业生产任务，并提出许多具体措施来保证这一任务的完成。
    中共湖北省委目前正在召开各级党委工业书记会议。会议上布置的第二季度钢、铁、煤炭等重点产品产量一般比第一季度实际产量增加一倍以上，钢材、耐火材料、木材等生产任务也有很大增加。会议认为，必须进一步深入贯彻“全国一盘棋”的思想，使它成为全省一切企业和职工的指导思想，千方百计地完成国家计划，地方企业必须努力支援中央重点企业。
    会议确定首先集中力量搞好煤、铁的生产。湖北省有一定的炼钢设备能力，目前的关键问题是需要有足够的炼钢生铁，而生铁生产的关键又在于炼焦煤的供应。目前省内煤炭工业状况一方面是基础弱产量低，另一方面是运不出来。因此，中共湖北省委决定专门成立煤炭指挥部，加强对煤炭生产、运输、分配和使用工作的领导。同时采取以下措施：（1）加速重点煤矿的建设和小煤窑的改造，凡是交通便利、资源好、稍加改造便可大量生产的小煤窑，要迅速加以改造和扩建，使它们在最近期间就能成倍增加产量。小煤窑改造和扩建所需要的机械、坑木、炸药等，有关部门要优先供应。（2）组织煤炭专业运输队伍，调拨汽车几百辆，必要时采取歇人不歇车的办法，突击运煤。（3）使用煤炭的各部门要想尽一切办法，降低煤耗。在搞好煤炭生产的同时，要求有关部门加速冶金设备的制造和配套，已经运到工地的冶金设备要迅速安装起来，省冶金、机械部门将联合成立检查组，检查和督促这方面的工作；大力开采矿石，加强对矿石分配的管理工作。地方冶金工业战线上的职工要开展好红旗竞赛，保证钢铁按质按量地完成生产计划。
    会议要求各地迅速清理仓库，妥善安排劳动力，保证重点产品的生产。要求各地继续大力开展增产节约运动，改革工具，改善劳动组织，以提高劳动生产效率，节约人力，降低生产成本。（附图片）
