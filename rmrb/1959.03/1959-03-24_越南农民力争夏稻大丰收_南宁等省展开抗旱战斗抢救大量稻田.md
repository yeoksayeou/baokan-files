Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch According to statistics from the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, up to now, the summer rice planting area in 27 provinces of Vietnam has reached 795,693 hectares, an increase of approximately 3% compared to the total summer rice planting area in 1958. It is expected that by the end of March, the summer rice planting area in Vietnam will be further expanded.

Vietnamese farmers are now striving to make the total summer rice output this year exceed the highest record in Vietnamese history, 1956, by more than 50%. In 1956, the average yield of summer rice was nearly 1,800 kilograms per hectare.

One of the important reasons for the expansion of the summer rice cultivation area is that many regions in Vietnam have vigorously promoted small-scale water conservancy projects run by the people, turning thousands of hectares of single-season rice paddies into double-season rice paddies.

The density of summer rice planting this year is generally higher than last year. According to statistics, more than half of the summer rice fields are planted at more than double the density of last year. In some places, the entire township is planted at three or four times the density of last year. At the same time, deeper plowing is generally practiced everywhere compared to last year.

The base fertilizer for paddy fields has also increased this year compared to last year. Last year, the average application of base fertilizer was 30 *tiaos* per *mu* in North Vietnam, this year it has increased to more than 40 *tiaos*. The movement of accumulating and producing fertilizer is still vigorously developing.

Agricultural cooperatives have played a role in promoting the movement of intensive and meticulous farming of summer rice. A common phenomenon has appeared in various provinces: when the densely planted seedling fields experimentally cultivated by agricultural cooperatives grow lush and strong, individual farmers and mutual aid teams also follow suit and engage in dense planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Electric Dispatch The people in the drought-stricken areas of Northern Vietnam are launching a large-scale drought resistance campaign and have already rescued a large number of seedling fields.

Due to the attention paid to the development of small-scale water conservancy projects, the drought-affected area in the entire North Vietnam has been greatly reduced this year compared to last year. During the winter and spring cultivation period last year, a total of 200,000 hectares of dry land were affected by drought, while this year it is only 80,000 hectares. Last year, the drought almost spread to all provinces, while this year it is more concentrated in a few provinces such as Nanning, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ninh Binh. These areas have not had rain for six consecutive months since last winter and this spring.

From national leaders to township cadres, great importance is attached to drought resistance work, and they directly guide and participate in the drought resistance campaign. President Ho Chi Minh and Premier Pham Van Dong have inspected the drought situation in rural areas several times. Provinces and counties have also sent hundreds and thousands of cadres, troops, and students to rural areas to assist in drought resistance.

In the drought resistance work, cadres and farmers have formed a strong drought resistance front. They have adopted a combination of measures such as digging canals, water lifting, digging wells, and using water pumps to draw water, day and night, to introduce river water, stream water, and pond water into the dry fields.

Ninh Binh Province mobilized 100,000 people to engage in digging canals and water lifting. The torches of the night drought resistance work teams illuminated the entire village. Within ten days, the entire province rescued 15,000 hectares of dry land. The people of Nghe An Province dug more than 600 kilometers of various water diversion ditches, enabling many fields to obtain irrigation. Labor Party members in Fufang Township, Shanxi Province, took the lead in working hard in the drought resistance struggle, digging a total of ten levels of terraced water lifting channels from low-lying areas to high slopes, and lifted river water to a mountain slope 17 meters high to irrigate dry land. Their exemplary behavior boosted the drought resistance enthusiasm of the entire township.

Currently, on the seedling fields that have been revived, field management and fertilization are being strengthened. The farmers of various provinces have repeatedly expressed their determination at production and drought resistance meetings to quickly overcome the drought and double the fertilization to ensure a bumper summer rice harvest.

### 越南农民力争夏稻大丰收  南宁等省展开抗旱战斗抢救大量稻田

    越南农民力争夏稻大丰收
    南宁等省展开抗旱战斗抢救大量稻田
    据新华社河内电　据越南农林部的统计，到目前为止，越南二十七个省的夏稻种植面积已经达到七十九万五千六百九十三公顷，比1958年全部的夏稻种植面积增加约3％。预计到3月底，越南的夏稻种植面积将比目前进一步扩大。
    现在越南农民正在力争使今年夏稻总产量超过越南历史上最高纪录1956年的50％以上。1956年夏稻平均每公顷产量近一千八百公斤。
    夏稻耕种面积扩大的重要原因之一是，越南许多地区大力推广了民办的小型水利工程，使成千公顷的单季稻田变成了双季稻田。
    今年夏稻的密植程度一般都比去年增加。据统计，有一半以上的夏稻田比去年密植一倍以上。有的地方，全乡比去年密植三、四倍。同时，各地一般都比去年进一步深耕。
    稻田的底肥今年也比去年增加。去年平均每北越亩施底肥三十挑，今年增加到四十多挑。现在积肥、造肥的运动还在蓬勃地开展着。
    农业合作社在夏稻深耕细作的运动中起了推动的作用。各省普遍出现这样的现象：当农业社试种的密植秧田青葱茁壮地成长的时候，单干农民和变工组也跟着进行密植。
    据新华社河内电　越南北方抗旱地区人民正在展开一场大规模的抗旱工作，并且已经抢救了大量秧田。
    由于注意发展小型水利工程，今年整个北越的旱灾面积比去年大为减少。去年冬、春耕作期间，先后共有二十万公顷旱田，今年只有八万公顷。去年旱灾几乎遍及所有各省，今年比较集中在南宁、清化、义安、宁平等少数省份。这些地区去冬今春以来，一连六个月无雨。
    从国家领导人直到乡干部，都非常重视抗旱工作，他们直接指导和参加了抗旱的战斗。胡志明主席、范文同总理先后几次下乡视察旱情，各省、县也派了成百成千的干部、部队、学生下乡协助抗旱。
    在抗旱工作中，干部和农民组成了一条坚强的抗旱战线，他们采取了挖渠、戽水、打井、抽水机抽水相结合的措施，不分日夜地把河水、溪水、池塘水引入旱田。
    宁平省发动了十万人民投入挖渠和戽水的工作，夜间抗旱工作队的火把照亮了整个村庄。十天内，全省抢救了一万五千公顷旱田。义安省人民挖了六百多公里长的各种引水沟，使很多田地获得了灌溉。山西省富方乡的劳动党党员在抗旱斗争中带头苦干，从低洼地往高坡上挖了共十级的梯形戽水道，把河水戽到十七公尺高的山坡上灌溉旱田。他们的模范行为鼓起全乡的抗旱干劲。
    目前，在已经救活的秧田上，正在加强田间管理和施肥工作。各省的农民们在生产和抗旱的会议上一再表示决心，一定要迅速战胜旱灾和加倍施肥，以保证夏稻丰收。
