    Refractory Materials
    Refractory materials are building materials used to construct various industrial kilns. They occupy an important position in industrial development. Ironmaking, steelmaking, and coking all require refractory materials. The non-ferrous metal industry, including copper smelting, aluminum smelting, and zinc smelting, also needs refractory materials. Refractory materials are also indispensable in the power industry, cement and lime industry, glass industry, and other sectors.

  Most refractory materials are made from natural mineral products. For example, clay bricks are made from fire clay, high-alumina bricks are made from magnesite, and so on. China has reserves of these natural raw materials for refractory materials. China's bauxite and magnesite are not only abundant but also of excellent quality.

    耐火材料
    耐火材料是修建各种工业窑炉的建筑材料。它在工业发展中占着重要的地位。炼铁、炼钢、炼焦需要耐火材料。有色金属工业的炼铜、炼铝、炼锌等也都需要耐火材料。在动力工业、水泥石灰工业、玻璃工业等部门，耐火材料也是不可缺少的。
  大多数耐火材料的原料是天然矿产品。如粘土砖的原料是耐火粘土，高铝氧砖的原料是菱镁矿，等等。耐火材料的这些天然原料，我国都有蕴藏。我国的矾土和菱镁矿，不但蕴藏丰富，而且质量优良。
