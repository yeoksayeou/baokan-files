    The large-scale color documentary “The Dawn of Iraq,” produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been released. We are all concerned about the revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people. Taking this opportunity, let us introduce the filming process of this film to everyone!

    In early September 1958, we stepped onto the free land of the newly born Republic of Iraq with excitement.

    Prime Minister Qasim received us in his busy schedule. The Prime Minister warmly welcomed us to his country to make a film, hoping to convey the friendship of the Iraqi people to the Chinese people through the film. Prime Minister Qasim said, "You are welcome to stay as long as you like, until your work is successfully completed."

    In three months, we traveled all over Iraq, visiting Mosul, the largest city in the north, the oil base Kirkuk, the Kurdish capital Sulaymaniyah, and in the south, we visited Basra, the city of date palms, Amarah, the land of fish and rice, and the seaport Fao. Wherever we went, the Iraqi government and army, and the Iraqi people warmly welcomed us. In Basra, people's organizations such as the trade union, the Democratic Women's League, the Democratic Youth League, the Student Union, and the Sports Association held a mass meeting of more than 2,000 people to welcome us. When we entered the venue, everyone stood up, applause and cheers were heard as one, and they shouted "Long live the Chinese people," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live Qasim." The chairman of the trade union warmly welcomed us to visit Basra on behalf of all the workers and the people of the city. He said that the Chinese people stood with us when our republic was in the most difficult time, which the Iraqi people will never forget, and the Iraqi people regard the Chinese people as their brothers.

    In the northern Kurdish region, we were also warmly received. Governor Kashili held a lavish banquet for our visit and personally arranged our visit plan. We visited the Motor Drivers' Union, the Kurdish Student Union, the Artists' Association, and the Tailors' Association, and they expressed the friendship of the Kurdish people to the Chinese people. An old tailor who had been in prison for seven years under the old regime told us that in the Nuri al-Said era, Kurds and Arabs could never be of one mind, but today Qasim has connected the hearts of us Kurds and Arabs. The chairman of the Motor Drivers' Union, on behalf of all motor workers, wrote a letter full of sincere friendship to the Chinese worker brothers, entrusting us to pass it on to the Chinese worker brothers.

    We were also honored to visit the 19th Brigade of the Army, this heroic army that, under the direct leadership of General Qasim, first raised the torch of the July Revolution and broke the shackles that had been on the Iraqi people for a long time. Colonel Mahmoud, the commander of the 19th Brigade, welcomed us as warmly as all Iraqis. He said in front of all the officers and soldiers of the brigade: "The 600 million Chinese people are our best friends and brothers. The common responsibility of the people and armies of our two countries is to oppose war and defend peace. Before the revolution, Said told you 'China is your enemy,' which was completely deception and slander. Look, today Chinese friends have specially come to our 19th Brigade to make a film, how much they like you."

    In Iraq, only a short ninety days, the Iraqi people left us with unforgettable memories. We will never forget those warm, brotherly Iraqi friends, and never forget the heroic Iraqi people! (Attached pictures)

    沐浴在伊拉克的曙光里

    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的大型彩色纪录片“伊拉克的曙光”上映了。我们都在关心着伊拉克人民的革命斗争。趁这个机会，让我们向大家介绍这部影片拍摄经过吧！
    1958年9月初，我们怀着兴奋的心情，踏上新生的伊拉克共和国自由的土地。
    卡塞姆总理在百忙中接见了我们。总理热情地欢迎我们到他的国家拍电影，希望通过影片把伊拉克人民的友情传达给中国人民。卡塞姆总理说：“你们愿意呆多久就呆多久，直到你们工作胜利完成”。
    在三个月中，我们走遍了伊拉克全国，访问了北方最大城市摩苏尔、石油基地基尔库克、库尔德民族首府苏来马尼亚，在南方访问了枣椰之城巴士拉、渔米之乡阿马腊，海港法欧等地。无论到那里，伊拉克政府和军队、伊拉克人民都热情地欢迎我们。在巴士拉，由工会、民主妇女联合会、民主青年联会、学生联合会、体育协会等人民团体，为了欢迎我们，举行了二千多人的群众大会。当我们走进会场时，全体起立，掌声和欢呼声连成一片，他们高呼“中国人民万岁”“毛泽东万岁”“卡塞姆万岁”。工会主席代表全市工人和全市人民热烈地欢迎我们访问巴士拉。他说中国人民在我们共和国最困难的时候和我们站在一起，这是伊拉克人民永远不会忘记的，伊拉克人民把中国人民看成是自己的兄弟。
    在北方库尔德民族地区，我们同样地受到热情的接待。省长卡息利先生为我们的访问举行了丰盛的宴会，并亲自给我们安排了访问计划。我们访问了汽车司机工会、库尔德学联，艺术家协会和裁缝协会，他们向我们表达了库尔德民族对中国人民的友谊。一位在旧政权坐过七年监狱的老裁缝对我们说，努里·赛义德时代，库尔德人和阿拉伯人总也不能一条心，今天卡塞姆把我们库尔德人和阿拉伯人的心连接在一起了。汽车司机工会主席代表全体汽车工人给中国工人写了一封充满真挚友情的信，委托我们转给中国工人兄弟。
    我们还很荣幸地访问了陆军十九旅，这支英雄军队在卡塞姆将军直接领导下，最先举起了七月革命的火炬，打断了长期套在伊拉克人民身上的枷锁。十九旅旅长马哈茂德上校像所有伊拉克人那样热情地欢迎我们，他在全旅官兵面前讲了这样的话：“六亿中国人民是我们最好的朋友和兄弟，我们两国人民和军队共同的职责是反对战争保卫和平。革命前，赛义德告诉你们‘中国是你们的敌人’，那完全是欺骗和污蔑。你们看，今天中国朋友特地到我们十九旅拍电影，他们是多么喜欢你们啊。”
    在伊拉克只有短短的九十天，伊拉克人民给我们留下了难忘的记忆。我们永远忘不了那些热情的、兄弟般的伊拉克朋友们，忘不了英雄的伊拉克人民！（附图片）
