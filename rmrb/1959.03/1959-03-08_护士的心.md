　　The Nurse's Heart
　　Hai Leng
　　Treats patients as family,
　　Feeling their pain as my own,
　　Never tired of their calls,
　　Hoping for their recovery.
　　Serving day and night with diligence,
　　Always mindful of the room's temperature,
　　Year after year, day after day,
　　Forever dedicating youth to the people.
　　On the eve of International Women's Day

    护士的心
    海稜长把病人当亲人，病人心疼我心疼，千呼万唤不厌倦，但愿病人得康宁。昼夜侍候多殷勤，病房冷暖时在心，年年月月如一日，永把青春献人民。
    于三八节前夕
