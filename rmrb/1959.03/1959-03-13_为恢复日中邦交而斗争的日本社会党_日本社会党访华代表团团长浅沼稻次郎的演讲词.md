(Reported by this newspaper) The Japan Socialist Party delegation, led by Inejiro Asanuma, delivered a speech entitled "The Japan Socialist Party Struggles for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations" at a lecture meeting held in Beijing on the evening of the 12th at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The full text is as follows:

Chinese friends:

I am Inejiro Asanuma, the head of the Japan Socialist Party delegation to China, as introduced just now.

We visited your country once before in April of the year before last, and this is our second time.

When we visited your country the year before last, I gave a speech at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Today I have another opportunity to speak, and I am standing on this platform again.

I am prepared to frankly talk about my, no, the Japan Socialist Party's views on the security and independence of our homeland, peace, and Asian peace.

Regarding the current world situation, the first point is:

In the two years since our Socialist Party delegation visited China in April 1957, the world situation has changed. Chairman Mao accurately said that "the East wind prevails over the West wind," and this is still the situation today.

Today, the forces demanding peace and democracy are strong in the world. In particular, the upsurge of anti-colonial and anti-imperialist forces in Asia and Africa has become a decisive force and trend.

The colonial system of imperialist countries is collapsing. However, in the Far East, there are still international tensions that cannot be ignored. This is manifested in the issues of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu) Islands, the presence of American military bases in Taiwan, a part of your country's territory, and the presence of American military bases in our Japanese mainland and Okinawa. At the same time, they are gradually being equipped with nuclear weapons of all sizes.

In this regard, the people of Japan and China share a common and important task of striving for non-nuclear armament and the removal of foreign military bases in Asia. Taiwan is a part of China, and Okinawa is a part of Japan. Despite this, they are separated from the mainland because of American imperialism. American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. We are fighting against American imperialism.

The second point regarding the world situation is the Kishi Cabinet's diplomatic policy towards Asian countries. This policy is that Japan not only subordinates itself to American imperialism, but also relies on the strength of the United States to treat Asian countries with unrepentant and fatally flawed policies. Since last year, the dangerous trend has been the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, which has the nature of a Japan-U.S. military alliance, and the issue of moving towards a Northeast Asian military alliance. This is also a trend that hinders friendship and normalization of diplomatic relations with China.

Due to the struggle of the Japanese people against the Police Duties Law and their efforts for peace, these trends have begun to falter. This is the fundamental problem that has caused the unfortunate state of Sino-Japanese relations today.

The revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the unfortunate state of Sino-Japanese relations are interrelated. It is the basic diplomatic policy of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and also the two wheels of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, which is subservient to the United States.

Kishi Nobusuke himself made this clear in an interview with NBC reporter Brown at the end of last year. If these policies are not fundamentally changed to move in the direction of establishing a peace system in Asia, then Japan has no bright future. For the people of Japan and China, this is an urgent and common task.

How to solve such a problem? Let me talk about it from the perspective of Sino-Japanese relations.

Since May last year, due to the policies of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a very difficult situation. Before this, although diplomatic relations had not yet been restored, China, starting with the Asanuma-Zhang Xiruo Joint Statement, had concluded dozens of friendly and exchange agreements with Japan. The Japanese people had also been working towards the restoration of diplomatic relations and engaging in exchange and friendly activities. However, it has finally come to a standstill. The Japanese people feel very distressed about this and are also angry with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

After Mr. Tadataka Sata, a member of the Socialist Party's House of Councillors, visited your country, he learned about your three principles and three measures and conveyed them correctly to the Japanese people. The three principles are: first, immediately stop hostile words and actions towards China and do not repeat them; second, stop the conspiracy of "two Chinas"; third, do not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan.

In September 1958, based on these three principles, our party decided on a new "Basic Policy for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations," which includes the following items:

    1. Demand that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet change its policy:
        (1) Stop all actions such as recognizing "two Chinas" and realize the restoration of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
        (2) The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and the international tensions related to the Taiwan issue should be resolved peacefully by the relevant countries.
        (3) Do not participate in the military system of the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" aimed at China.
        (4) Do not bring nuclear weapons into Japan.
        (5) Support the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations through the United Nations and other institutions.
        (6) Apologize for the flag-tearing incident in Nagasaki, take appropriate measures today, and guarantee the dignity of the national flag of the People's Republic of China.
        (7) Expand personal, cultural, technological, and economic exchanges on the basis of friendship and equality, no longer obstruct the normalization of diplomatic relations, and provide active support. In particular, the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement must be thoroughly implemented.

We believe that "regarding the issue surrounding the islands of Taiwan, military support for the Chiang Kai-shek group, especially the presence of American troops in Taiwan, is the cause of exacerbating tensions in Asia." Therefore, we demand that the Japanese government take a cautious attitude.

In addition, based on the above basic policies, the Socialist Party launched a national movement for the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and raised this movement to a new high. The key points of the national movement are:

    (1) In order to make the Kishi Nobusuke government fully change its policies, widely unite all national forces and vigorously carry out this movement.
    (2) It is difficult for the current Kishi Nobusuke government to open up the situation. Based on this understanding, it is necessary to establish a situation in which long-term and tenacious movements can be carried out.
    (3) Carrying out this movement must be closely coordinated with the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, the return of Okinawa, the opposition to military bases, and the defense of the Constitution.
    (4) Our party will unite labor unions, agricultural associations, youth and women's groups, various economic, cultural, and democratic groups, and encourage financial circles and enlightened people in the Conservative Party to participate in the movement.

In particular, we must strengthen the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, which is supported by our party, and actively carry out the movement through the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations. Based on the above national movement and the results of the struggle to demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policies, our party, in accordance with the spirit of the Asanuma-Zhang Xiruo Joint Statement, demands that the Chinese side provide active cooperation in improving Sino-Japanese relations. This is our basic policy.

In addition, in January of this year, the Central Committee of the Japan Socialist Party decided that in the national movement to date against military bases, defending the Peaceful Constitution, banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, returning Okinawa, restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and crushing the Japan-U.S. "Security" system, this year, we will particularly concentrate our efforts on the struggle of the national movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and crush the Japan-U.S. "Security" system. Furthermore, as a part of this movement, it was also decided to send a Socialist Party delegation to China when the time is right. The reason for doing so is that no matter what kind of unfortunate situation we are in, we must continue to strive for friendship and exchange between the people of Japan and China. We hope that through this effort, the movement of the people of Japan and China against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policy to restore diplomatic relations can advance greatly.

Our delegation is visiting China again based on this viewpoint. The second purpose of visiting China is to see the real situation of the Great Leap Forward in China and convey the situation of the leap forward correctly to the Japanese working masses.

When we departed from Japan, Japanese democratic and peace groups convened a national conference on "Crushing the Security Treaty and Restoring Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," and encouraged our delegation with the following resolution. The resolution is as follows:

"The government has now clearly stated that it intends to revise the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. This revision will not only fix the current security system, but also reaffirm that Japan is participating in the American military bloc according to its own will, and openly participate in the joint 'defense' system with the United States. Due to the strengthening of Japan's military power and the compulsory completion of American military obligations, it is inevitable to dispatch troops abroad, and Article 9 of the Constitution will completely become a dead letter.

In particular, since this revision will allow the import of American nuclear weapons, it is clear that Japan itself will also move towards nuclear armament. As a result, Sino-Japanese relations will enter a serious state. It is obvious that not to mention the development of current Sino-Japanese relations, the restoration of diplomatic relations will inevitably become hopeless.

This dangerous 'security' system, and the 'secret protection law' and 'anti-espionage law' formulated to complete this purpose, the revision of the 'Police Duties Law' for the worse, and thus the suppression of the basic human rights and freedoms of the people; the lives of the people will be destroyed due to the strengthening of military power; for these, as those who expect the peace and prosperity of Japan and hope to maintain friendly relations with any country on an equal footing, we must resolutely fight.

We have the experience and results of crushing the attempt to revise the Police Duties Law for the worse last year. Until now, this driving force continues to burn strongly in the midst of every citizen, and the confidence that struggle will lead to victory is growing day by day.

We, who attended this conference, have once again strengthened our determination to unite the demands and actions of this class, resolutely prevent the revision of the 'Security' Treaty, and then abolish the 'Security' Treaty, and crush the shackles of the United States. Establish a policy of peace and realize the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations."

This resolution is full of the Japanese people's ardent desire for peace and democracy and for the speedy restoration of diplomatic relations with China.

Since visiting China for about a week, we have been deeply moved by the unwavering principled attitude and consistent friendship of the Chinese, led by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. In particular, we were deeply moved after visiting the agricultural exhibition and seeing the astonishing increase in crop production, the leap forward in industrial construction, and especially after seeing the People's Commune. I hope that many Japanese people, especially Japanese farmers, will come to China to visit in person, because facts speak louder than words.

In the future, the important task between the people of China and Japan is first of all that we must vigorously carry out the national movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations under the correct policy of the three principles, so as to crush the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government. I am sure that this is the first priority.

But these alone cannot completely remove the responsibility of the Japanese people to Asian countries.

We must eliminate the foreign military bases that have become a threat to the entire Asia from Japan and Okinawa. This is our responsibility.

Therefore, the Japan Socialist Party regards crushing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system as the central task.

If the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system is abolished, Japan's peace will be guaranteed, and we expect that the military clause in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance regarding the expected Japanese militarism and the forces behind it will naturally lose its effectiveness. At the same time, the Japan Socialist Party has always hoped to establish a universal peace and security guarantee system in Asia including China, the Soviet Union, Japan, and the United States, so as to maintain lasting peace in Japan and Asia. Our Japan Socialist Party will fight for this.

Since last year, China and the Soviet Union have once again confirmed the independent and neutral policy that the Japan Socialist Party has consistently advocated. We are heartily happy about this for the advancement of peaceful diplomacy.

For the peace of Asia and Japan, it is necessary to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory.

In China, 680 million people have established the People's Republic of China. Japan must restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we believe that it is only natural for the People's Republic of China to restore its representation in the United Nations.

At the same time, I think we should eliminate the Japan-Taiwan Treaty between Japan and the Taiwan regime.

Japan restored peace with the countries that had given war disasters and exchanged ambassadors and ministers. However, Japan gave China the greatest disaster from the September 18th Incident until the end of World War II, but it did not restore diplomatic relations with China. This is because the Conservative Party implemented wrong policies. We feel very sorry about this.

Our Socialist Party sincerely hopes to restore diplomatic relations with China as soon as possible. Originally, the mistake of Japanese diplomacy was that it often adopted the practice of befriending distant countries and attacking neighboring ones. In the Meiji era, Japan formed an alliance with distant Britain and played the role of a gatekeeper in Asia. In World War II, Japan formed a military alliance with distant Germany and Italy, opposed and attempted to invade China and other Asian countries, and carried out imperialist expansion. This was a great mistake. Now Japan is colluding with the United States, playing the role of a medium for the United States to carry out imperialist expansion in Southeast Asia, and will suffer another defeat.

We of the Socialist Party oppose this diplomatic policy. That is to say, we believe that we should change from the policy of befriending distant countries and attacking neighboring ones, which is to form an alliance with distant countries and attack neighboring countries, to the policy of being friendly with neighbors. In other words, we advocate establishing friendly relations with any country, and promoting independent, autonomous, good-neighborly and friendly diplomacy, that is, to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, strengthen cooperation with Asian and African countries, and a diplomatic policy of world peace.

In the economic field, I believe that Japan and China, which are in a relationship of being separated by a narrow strip of water, should cooperate closely. Now, Japan's economy only relies on trade with the United States and American special procurements. The import of surplus agricultural products under the Common Aid and Defense Agreement is also a manifestation of Japan's collusion with the United States and reliance on the American war economy. We feel uneasy about this.

Without economic independence and autonomy, there can be no national independence and autonomy. In order to become a completely independent and autonomous country, Japan must get rid of its dependence on the United States. Japan now cannot fully agree with Asia, which should become one, but relies on American special procurements to conduct trade with the United States, resulting in excessive imports over exports. This is the economic foundation that produces today's unfortunate state, and the economic foundation of reactionary policies. Therefore, we demand that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet hand over power to the Socialist Party, fundamentally change its policies, restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and expect that stable Sino-Japanese trade and economic cooperation with Asian countries, combined with China's leaping Second Five-Year Plan, will develop by leaps and bounds on this basis. In this way, Japan can establish an economic foundation for independent and neutral policies, so that its heavy industrial technology, equipment, and aircraft manufacturing plants can serve the peaceful construction of Asia. We are visiting China with this desire for peace and friendship. We want to return home after exchanging this firm friendship with you gentlemen that Asia is one family. After returning to Japan, we will submit a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to the Diet. Next, we will make a report on our visit to China and give speeches all over the country. In June, we will invest in local elections and elections of members of the House of Councillors. These two election struggles are related to whether we can dissolve the Diet and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. This is the dividing line that determines whether we can move forward and whether the reactionaries can reorganize their forces. Recently, the more powerful the forces of peace and innovation in Japan, the more desperately the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the bourgeoisie resist. We will definitely win this struggle and fundamentally change the current Japanese political situation and policies. We will also definitely fight to the end with our Chinese friends for Asian and world peace.

Finally, what I want to say is that when I came to China the year before last and met Mr. Mao Zedong, Mr. Mao Zedong said that China has now resolved domestic contradictions, that is, it has resolved class struggles, that is, the contradictions of anti-imperialist struggles, anti-feudal struggles, and socialist revolutions, and is uniting 680 million people to begin fighting nature.

This time I came to China and saw the Chinese people fighting nature for victory, and expressed admiration.

We can see from afforestation, water control, agriculture, and industry that the Chinese people have achieved victory in their struggle with nature.

The large iron bridge erected over the Yangtze River, the Sanmenxia Reservoir on the Yellow River, the Three Gorges Reservoir on the Yangtze River, the Great Green Wall, the building of factories in the desert, railways, and other Great Leap Forward achievements are innumerable. Everywhere we can see the victories achieved by the Chinese people in their struggle with nature.

I believe that the original appearance of mankind is not the mutual struggle between humans. It is not the class struggle between classes, nor the struggle between nations. Mankind should solve this problem as soon as possible and mobilize all its forces to fight against nature.

Now China has resolved all contradictions and concentrated on fighting against nature. From this, we can imagine the advancement of socialist countries.

We cannot help but wish this struggle victory.

We are also determined to fight against capitalism and imperialism in Japan, and resolve domestic contradictions to move to the next step, that is, to mobilize all forces to fight against nature and continue to fight for the happiness of mankind.

My speech is over.

Long live the leaping Socialist China!

Long live the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations!

Long live Asian and world peace!

    为恢复日中邦交而斗争的日本社会党
    日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎的演讲词
    本报讯　日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎12日晚应中国人民外交学会的邀请在北京举行演讲会，发表了题为“为恢复日中邦交而斗争的日本社会党”的演讲，全文如下：中国的朋友们：
    我是刚才承蒙介绍的日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎。
    前年4月间我们曾经访问过贵国，这次是第二次了。
    前年访问贵国的时候，曾经应中国人民外交学会的邀请做过讲演，这一次又得到讲演的机会，我又站在这个讲坛上来了。
    我准备坦率地把我、不、把日本社会党对于祖国的安全独立、和平以及亚洲和平的看法谈一谈。
    就目前世界形势来说，首先第一点是：
    在两年前，也就是1957年4月，我们社会党代表团访问中国以后，世界形势起了变化。毛主席确切的说是“东风压倒西风”，现在也还是这个局面。
    今天在世界上，要求和平和民主的力量强大了，特别是亚洲和非洲的反殖民地、反帝力量的高潮，已经成为决定性的力量和趋势。
    帝国主义国家的殖民体系正在崩溃。但是在远东，仍然存在着不可忽略的国际紧张的因素。这就是在金门、马祖岛的问题上所表现出来的、在贵国一部分领土的台湾，有美国的军事基地，并且在我们日本本土和冲绳岛也有美国的军事基地。同时，它们逐渐被大大小小的核武器装备起来。
    日中两国国民在这方面，担负着在亚洲争取非核武装和撤销外国军事基地的共同的重大课题。台湾是中国的一部分，冲绳岛也是日本的一部分。尽管如此，它们和本土分离了，这是因为美帝国主义的原故。美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人。我们为反对美帝国主义而斗争。
    世界形势的第二点，就是岸内阁对待亚洲国家的外交政策。这个政策就是日本不仅从属于美帝国主义，而且还借助于美国的力量，以没有反省的、致命错误的政策来对待亚洲国家。自去年以来，危险的动向就是具有日美军事同盟性质的日美安全保障条约的修改，以及走向东北亚军事同盟的问题，并且这也是阻碍同中国的友好和邦交正常化的动向。
    由于日本国民反对警职法的斗争，以及要求和平的努力，这些动向开始了动摇，而这就是造成今天在日中关系上不幸原因的根本问题。
    以上所说的修改日美安全保障条约和日中关系的不幸状态，是相互关连的，它是岸信介内阁的基本外交方针，也是屈从于美国的岸信介内阁的两个车轮。
    去年年底岸信介对美国全国广播公司记者布朗的谈话中，他自己的确表明了这一点。如果不是根本地改变这些政策，走向在亚洲建立和平体系的方向，那么，日本就没有光明的前途，对于日中两国国民来说，这也是紧急并且是共同的课题。
    如何解决这样的问题呢？从日中关系的角度来说一下。
    自从去年5月以来，由于岸信介内阁的政策，日中关系进入了非常困难的局面。在这以前，尽管还没有恢复邦交，但是，中国方面以浅沼、张奚若共同声明的开端，同日本缔结了几十个友好与交流的协定，日本国民也同样地为恢复邦交，致力于交流与友好的活动，然而也终于陷于停止的局面了。日本国民对这件事感到非常痛心，对岸信介内阁也感到愤怒。
    社会党参议院议员佐多忠隆先生访问贵国以后，知道了你们的三项原则三个措施，并向日本国民做了正确的传达。这三个原则是：第一，立刻停止敌视中国的言论和行动，不再重复；第二，停止“两个中国”的阴谋活动；第三，不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复。
    1958年9月，我们党根据这三个原则，决定了新的“打开日中关系的基本方针”，共包括以下几个项目：
    一、要求岸信介内阁改变政策：
      （一）停止诸如承认“两个中国”的一切行动，实现同中华人民共和国恢复邦交。
      （二）台湾问题是中国的内政问题，由有关各国和平解决与台湾问题有关的国际紧张局势问题。
      （三）不参加以中国为对象的“东北亚条约组织”的军事体制。
      （四）不把核子武器运到日本国内来。
      （五）通过联合国以及其他机构，支持中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权。
      （六）对在长崎撕毁国旗事件一事，表示道歉，今天采取妥善措施，保证中华人民共和国的国旗尊严。
      （七）在友好和平等的基础上，扩大人物、文化、技术和经济的交流，不再阻挠邦交的正常化，并给予积极的支持。特别要彻底实现第四次中日贸易协定。
    我们认为：“就环绕台湾岛屿问题而论，对蒋介石集团的军事支援，特别是美军驻在台湾是加剧亚洲紧张局势的原因”，因此，我们要求日本政府采取慎重态度。
    此外，社会党根据以上的基本方针，为了日中邦交的正常化，开展了国民运动，并使这一运动高涨起来。国民运动的要点是：
      （一）为了使岸信介政府全面改变它的政策，广泛地团结所有的国民力量，强有力地开展这个运动；
      （二）由现在的岸信介政府来打开现状是很困难的，根据这种认识，必须建立能够开展长期而又顽强运动的局面；
      （三）开展这个运动，必须同反对原子弹、氢弹，归还冲绳岛，反对军事基地，拥护宪法等运动密切合作。
      （四）我党将团结工会、农会、青年妇女团体、各个经济文化以及民主团体，并使财界和保守党的有识之士都参加到运动中来。
    特别是要加强我党所支持的日中邦交恢复国民会议，通过日中邦交恢复国民会议来积极地开展运动。我党根据上述国民运动，和要求岸信介政府改变政策斗争的成果，按照浅沼、张奚若联合声明的精神，要求中国方面对改善日中关系寄予积极的合作，这就是我们的基本方针。
    此外，今年1月日本社会党中央委员会决定，在迄今为止的反对军事基地运动，拥护和平宪法，禁止原子弹、氢弹，归还冲绳，恢复日中邦交以及粉碎日美“安全保障”体系的国民运动中，今年特别要集中力量到恢复日中邦交的国民运动和粉碎日美“安全保障”体系的国民运动的斗争上来。并且，作为这个运动的一个环节还决定看时机派遣社会党访华代表团。所以要这样作，是因为无论处于什么样的不幸状态，必须不断为日中国民之间的友好和交流而努力，我们期望通过这种努力使日中两国国民反对岸信介内阁政策的恢复邦交运动得以大踏步地前进。
    我们代表团是根据这个观点再次访问中国的，访问中国的第二个目的是参观中国大跃进真实情况，正确地向日本劳动大众传达跃进的情况。
    日本的民主团体和和平团体，在我们从日本动身的时候，召开了“粉碎安全保障条约和恢复日中邦交”的国民大会，用下面的决议勉励我们代表团。这个决议如下：
    “现在政府已明确表示它要修改日美安全保障条约。这次修改不仅要固定现行的安全保障体制，而且再次明确肯定日本是根据自己的意志，参加到美国军事集团中去，公开参加同美国之间的共同‘防御’体制中去。由于增强了日本的军事力量，强制完成美国军事义务，不可避免的向国外派兵，宪法的第九条将完全成为一纸空文。
    特别是，由于这次的修改将准许运入美国的核武器，日本本身也将走向核武器装备的道路上去，这是很明显的；其结果日中关系将进入严重状态，不要说目前的日中关系的开展，就是恢复邦交也势必成为没有希望的事情了。这也是很明显的。
    这种危险的‘安全保障’体制，和为了完成这个目的而制订‘秘密保护法’，‘防谍法’、往坏里修改‘警职法’，因此而压迫国民的基本人权和自由；国民生活由于军事力量的加强而遭受破坏，对于这些，作为期望日本的和平和繁荣、希望同任何一个国家都平等保持友好关系的我们来说，必须坚决进行斗争。
    我们有在去年粉碎往坏里修改警职法企图的经验和成果。直到现在，这个原动力还继续强烈地燃烧在每一个国民的中间，只要斗争就会获取胜利的信心日渐高涨。
    出席这次大会的我们，再一次坚定了我们的决心，同这个阶层统一要求和行动，坚决阻止‘安全保障’条约的修改，进而废除‘安全保障’条约，粉碎美国的枷锁。树立和平政策，实现日中邦交的恢复”。
    这个决议充满了日本国民爱好和平和民主、尽速恢复同中国之间邦交的热烈愿望。
    访问中国以来大约一个星期的时间内，我们对于以中国人民外交学会为首，中国各位坚定不移的原则态度和始终如一的友情，深受感动。特别是在农业展览会上参观了农作物惊人的增产，参观了工业建设的飞跃发展，特别是看了人民公社以后深受感动。我希望许多日本国民、特别是日本农民到中国来实际参观一下，因为事实胜于雄辩。
    今后在日中两国国民间的重要课题，首先就是我们一定要在三原则的正确方针下，强有力地开展恢复日中邦交的国民运动，从而粉碎岸信介政府的反动政策，我确信这是首要的。
    但是只是这些，并不能完全卸掉日本国民对亚洲国家的责任。
    一定要从日本和冲绳岛消灭成为威胁整个亚洲的外国军事基地。这是我们的责任。
    因此，日本社会党把粉碎日美安全保障条约体系作为中心课题。
    如果废除了日美安全保障体系，日本的和平有了保证，我们期待着中苏友好互助条约中关于对待预料中的日本军国主义及其背后力量的那项军事条款，也自己就会自然失去效力。同时，日本社会党一向希望确立包括中国、苏联、日本、美国的亚洲的普遍的和平安全保障体系，从而在日本和亚洲保持永久和平，我们日本社会党将为此而奋斗。
    去年以来，中苏两国再一次确认了日本社会党所一贯主张的自主独立、积极中立政策，对此，我们为和平外交的前进而衷心感到高兴。
    为了亚洲与日本的和平，必须要恢复中国和日本的邦交。中国只有一个，台湾是中国领土的一部分。
    在中国，六亿八千万的人民建立了中华人民共和国。日本必须要和中华人民共和国之间恢复邦交。同时，我们认为中华人民共和国恢复联合国的代表权是理所当然的。
    同时，我认为应该消除日本和台湾政权之间的日台条约。
    日本同曾经给予战争灾难的国家恢复和平状态，并交换大使和公使。然而，日本从九一八事变直到第二次世界大战结束为止，给中国以最大的灾难，但和中国却没有恢复邦交。这是由于保守党执行了错误的政策，我们感到非常遗憾。
    我们社会党衷心期望能和中国早日恢复邦交。本来，日本外交的错误在于经常采取远交近攻的做法。明治年代，日本和远处的英国结成同盟，在亚洲起了门哨的作用。在第二次世界大战中，日本又和远处的德国、意大利结成军事同盟，反对和试图侵略中国和亚洲各国，进行了帝国主义扩张，这是极大的错误。现在日本又和美国勾结，起着美国向东南亚进行帝国主义扩张的媒介的作用，又要再一次遭到失败。
    我们社会党反对这种外交政策。也就是说，我们认为应该由和远处的国家结成同盟进攻近邻国家的远交近攻的政策转变到和近邻友好的政策。也就是说，我们主张和任何国家都建立友好关系，并推动独立自主善邻友好的外交、即为实现日中邦交正常化、加强和亚非各国的合作以及世界和平的外交政策。
    在经济方面，我相信，处于一衣带水的关系的日本和中国应该紧密合作。现在，日本的经济仅仅依靠和美国的贸易以及美国的特需。根据共同援助防御协定进口剩余农产品等，也是日本和美国勾结并依靠美国战争经济的一种表现，对此，我们感到不安。
    没有经济的独立自主，也不可能有民族的独立自主。日本为了成为完全独立自主的国家，必须摆脱依赖美国的关系。日本现在不能完全同理应成为一体的亚洲取得一致，而依赖美国的特需，进行对美入超的贸易。这是产生今天不幸状态的经济基础，是反动政策的经济基础。因此我们要求岸信介内阁把政权移交给社会党，根本改变政策恢复日中邦交，并期待与正在跃进的中国的第二个五年计划结合的稳定的中日贸易和同亚洲各国的经济合作在这个基础上得到飞跃的发展。这样，日本就能建立独立和中立政策的经济基础，使它的重工业的技术、设备以及飞机制造厂为亚洲的和平建设服务。我们就是抱着这种和平和友好的愿望来访问中国的。我们要同各位先生交换亚洲是一家这种牢固的友情后回国。回到日本后，我们将向国会提出不信任 信介内阁案，接着要作访华报告和到全国各地演讲，到6月我们又要投入到地方选举和参议院议员选举中去。这两次选举斗争又关系到我们能不能解散国会打倒岸信介内阁；这是决定我们能否前进和反动派能否重整旗鼓的分界线。最近日本的和平和革新的力量愈强大，岸信介内阁和资产阶级就愈拚命地反抗。我们一定在这个斗争中取得胜利，根本改变目前的日本政局和政策。我们也一定和中国的朋友们一起为亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底。
    最后我要说的是，前年我来中国见到毛泽东先生时，毛泽东先生说现在中国已经解决了国内矛盾，也就是已经解决了阶级斗争即反帝斗争、反封建斗争和社会主义革命的矛盾，并正团结六亿八千万人民向自然开始斗争。
    这次我来到中国看到在与自然作斗争中争取胜利的中国人民，并表敬佩。
    我们可以通过造林、治水、农业、工业看到中国人民在与自然斗争中取得胜利。
    架在长江的大铁桥、黄河的三门峡水库、长江的三峡水库、绿色长城、在沙漠里盖工场、铁路等大跃进事迹真是不胜枚举。我们到处可以看到中国人民同自然进行斗争所获得的胜利。
    我认为人类的本来面貌并不是人类与人类之间进行相争。也不是阶级与阶级进行斗争，同时也不是民族与民族之间进行斗争，人类应早日解决这个问题，并动员一切力量来和自然作斗争。
    现在中国已解决了一切矛盾，并集中于大自然进行斗争。从这里我们可以想像社会主义国家的前进情况。
    我们不禁祝愿这斗争取得胜利。
    我们决心也在日本国内与资本主义斗争，与帝国主义斗争，并解决国内矛盾而向下一步、即动员一切力量向自然作斗争，为人类的幸福继续斗争。
    我的讲演完了。
    跃进中国的社会主义万岁！
    恢复中日帮交万岁！
    亚洲和世界和平万岁！
