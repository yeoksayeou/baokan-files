Hè Xīn Liáng

Artificial Rainmaking on the Qilian Mountains
Yang Jike

    White snow piles upon the frigid peaks.
    Gazing at the Qilian glaciers shimmering, iron mountains overlapping.
    Since ancient times, the Jade Gate Pass has been a path, difficult to find even a trace of spring breeze.
    Only stony deserts sadly piled up like the Gobi.
    How to obtain whale-like spouts of ten thousand springs, transforming thousands of miles of yellow sand into a verdant plain?
    New landscapes, see them today.

    Red flags wave, sending soaring wings.
    Scattering dry ice specks in the long sky, frozen clouds gathering.
    Sprinkling across the newly turned fields, hearing reports of pearl-like dewdrops.
    Happy events occur this year.
    Green waters slowly surround the borderland melodies, asking the east wind to carry in the colors of Jiangnan.
    In the commune, songs follow flutes.

    贺新凉
    祁连山人工造雨
    杨纪珂
    白雪寒峰积。望祁连冰川闪烁，铁山重叠。自古玉门关上路，难觅春风踪迹。但碛石愁堆戈壁。安得鲸喷泉万股，化黄沙千里平芜碧。新地貌，看今日。
    红旗挥送冲霄翼。散长空干冰点点，冻云凝集。洒遍新翻阡陌土，闻报珍珠露滴。幸福事而今年月。绿水漫萦关塞曲，倩东风度入江南色。公社里，歌随笛。
