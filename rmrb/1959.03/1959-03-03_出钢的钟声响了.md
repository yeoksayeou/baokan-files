Walking into the large Daoshan, turning left, the steel plant stands before you.

It's already past 10 o'clock at night, and people have long entered dreamland, but here, a battle to seize steel is reaching its climax. From afar, the huge factory building is shrouded in a blaze of light, with the sound of boiling steel, gongs and drums, and people's shouts intertwined. An open hearth furnace is tapping steel.

We walked towards the No. 23 open hearth furnace, which was tapping steel.

The newly cast ingot molds were scorching hot, and the wooden ladder burned as soon as it was placed down. Foreman Zhu Bingjin splashed water on himself and jumped in to rush repairs. In front of the furnace, engineer Jin Han took off his coat and worked with the workers to remove slag, braving the flames. Workers who had already finished their shift spontaneously formed a shock team and appeared in the most difficult places... This first batch of steel in the last shift of the day was an extraordinary batch! For it, people disregarded smoke and fire, and sweat-soaked clothes. If three more batches of steel could be successfully smelted like this, today's shift output, daily output, and smelting time would all be the highest new records since the start of operations, and coupled with the entire plant completing the monthly plan three days ahead of schedule, it would be a "fourfold happiness."

Could "fourfold happiness" really come?

The first two shifts successfully smelted five batches of steel, and the remaining four batches all depended on this last shift. Producing four batches per shift was unprecedented, but the Party resolutely supported the ambition of the masses. All leading cadres divided their forces and fought alongside the masses, determined to ensure that the fourfold happiness came.

The steel illuminated the excited faces of the people beside the open hearth furnace. We decided to go to the dispatch room to take a look.

The dispatch room was bustling with people coming and going. On the dispatch table, red lights kept flashing, and the telephone rang one after another.

Dispatcher Huang Yongde had just picked up the phone when an enthusiastic voice came from inside:

"I am the No. 2 Steelmaking Station of the Transportation Department. Today, our station chief personally took command to support you in achieving high production, and we guarantee not to delay you for even a second!"

Little Huang didn't have time to express his thanks when another voice rang out:

"Our ingot factory has already prepared the molds, so feel free to tap steel!"

As soon as the phone was hung up, someone outside the window shouted:

"We'll give you as much raw material as you need!"

The determination letter from the ingot casting section was also delivered with gongs and drums.

Little Huang seemed very excited, it was really too fortunate to be a dispatcher like this. While the previous process was still in progress, the next process had already automatically made all preparations, he hardly needed to worry at all. At the same time, good news came one after another from the open hearth furnace, everything was fast, everything was ahead of schedule... Little Huang's heart was ignited, and although he had been working for more than twenty hours, he didn't feel tired at all, and he couldn't bear to leave here.

"With such strong support from everyone, how could there be a problem with achieving high production?" Seeing us come in, Little Huang was particularly excited. "You see, this banner must be given up tonight." He was referring to a banner awarded by the Municipal Party Committee on September 29 last year, which hung in the dispatch room. At that time, the highest daily output reached 3,700 tons, but today, people's ambition is 4,300 tons!

Before Little Huang finished speaking, a young man ran in from outside:

"Four thousand three hundred is no problem! No. 20 furnace is about to tap steel!"

"So fast!" People exclaimed in unison. This was the third batch of fast steel smelted by No. 20 open hearth furnace today.

Little Huang clapped his hands hard.

"Good! Now it depends on the last batch of steel from No. 24 open hearth furnace!"

There were twice as many people at No. 24 open hearth furnace as usual. The young men sent to support from various open hearth furnaces were fighting under the personal command of foreman Ma Yufa. This old worker, who had worked beside the steelmaking furnace for more than 20 years, was supposed to get off work at 4 p.m. today, but he hadn't gone home until late at night. The two Party committee secretaries had just finished a meeting at the company and rushed over excitedly. The girls from the laboratory, who rarely came to the open hearth furnace before, personally came to take steel samples with two pairs of pliers. On the other side of the furnace, the photography reporter adjusted the angle, and the broadcast reporter turned on the tape recorder... People were all waiting for that final decisive moment.

Furnace chief Wu Jiarang, under the watchful eyes of everyone, strode to the front of the furnace and looked into the furnace through the blue lens. The molten steel turned from red to white, constantly tumbling, emitting uniform foam, and melting was about to end. Wu Jiarang suddenly felt his heart beating very fast.

The last batch of steel was tapped at 1 p.m. Whether another batch of steel could be produced before 24:00 was still a question in many people's minds. The highest record in the past was twelve hours, but now there were only eleven hours, and it was two shifts working together to smelt a batch of steel... Wu Jiarang knew that if this batch of steel couldn't be produced, the "fourfold happiness" would never "come." So he called a meeting of the young men: no matter what, we have to drive out this batch of steel!

Taking over the shift, the conditions were very good, and the previous shift loaded the materials, shortening the time by half compared to usual. Wu Jiarang led the young men to work hard, and shortened the time for adding molten iron by half. Now, the key was the carbon content at the end of melting. The materials were prepared by the previous shift. If the carbon content at the end of melting was too high, everything would be in vain. People said that two shifts working together couldn't achieve speed, and the reason lay here.

"The steel sample has been sent for testing, what will happen?" Wu Jiarang watched the molten steel and thought to himself.

"Carbon content at the end of melting is 0.18%, we can tap steel after adding a ladle of molten iron!" The voice from the laboratory relaxed everyone's tense mood at once, and joy seemed like water breaking a dam, pouring straight down, and the crowd boiled. The crane roared, sending the already prepared molten iron to the front of the furnace. In the sound of the silver whistle, only molten iron splashed up ten thousand silver flowers, slowly injected into the furnace. At the same time, the sound of gongs and drums rang out on the open hearth furnace platform. The ingot casting section carried large-character posters to tell the open hearth furnace:

"Tap steel, everything is ready."

The bell for steel tapping rang. Little Huang's excited voice drowned out the bell, telling people: today's shift output was four batches, the daily output was 4,333.8 tons, and the smelting time for the last batch of steel was 10 hours and 25 minutes. The three new records, plus completing the monthly plan three days ahead of schedule: all the "fourfold happiness" came to the steel plant.

    出钢的钟声响了
    吴承琬　许笃潭
    走进大型道上，往左一转，炼钢厂便矗立在眼前。
    已经是夜里十点多，人们早已进入梦乡，这里，一场夺钢大战却正在进入高潮。远远望去，庞大的厂房笼罩在一片火光中，钢水沸腾的声音、锣鼓声和人的喧闹声交织在一起。一座平炉出钢了。
    我们朝着正在出钢的二十三号平炉走去。
    刚铸完锭的大罐热气灼人，木梯子放下去就燃着了，工长朱秉金身上洒上水，就跳进去抢修。炉前，工程师靳汉脱去外衣，和工人一起顶火清渣，早就下了班的工人自动组成一支突击队出现在最困难的地方……这今天最后一个班的第一炉钢，是不寻常的一炉钢啊！为了它，人们顾不得烟熏火烤，汗湿衣衫。如果后面再能这样顺利地炼出三炉钢，今天的班产量、日产量、熔炼时间就都将是开工以来最高新纪录，再加上全厂提前三天完成月计划，恰巧是“四喜临门”。
    “四喜”究竟能不能临门？
    前头两个班很顺利地炼出了五炉钢，剩下四炉全靠这最后一班。班产四炉，这还是前所未有的事，但是党坚决地支持了群众的雄心。所有领导干部分兵把口，和群众一起苦战，非让四喜临门不可。
    钢水照亮了在平炉旁的人们激动的面孔。我们决定到调度室去看看。
    调度室里人来人往，热闹非凡。调度台上，红灯不住地闪烁，电话铃声一阵接着一阵。
    调度员黄永德刚抓起话筒，里面便传来一个热情的声音：
    “我是运输部二炼钢站，今天我们单站长亲自挂帅，支援你们闹高产，保证不耽误你们一分一秒！”
    小黄来不及道谢一声，另一个声音又响起来：
    “我们钢锭厂早把模子准备好了，放心出钢吧！”
    电话机刚撂下，窗外又有人喊：
    “原料要多少给多少！”
    铸锭工段的决心书也敲锣打鼓地送来了。
    小黄显得非常激动，作这样的调度员真是太幸运了。上一道工序还在进行，下一道工序已经自动地作好了一切准备，他简直不用操一点心。和这同时，平炉上喜讯接二连三，什么都快速，什么都提前……小黄的心都被点燃了，虽然已经工作了二十多个小时，他还一点不觉得累，怎么也舍不得离开这里。
    “人家这么大力支持，闹高产还能有问题？”看见我们走进来，小黄格外兴奋。“你们瞧，这面大旗今晚一定得让位了。”他指的是去年9月29日市委奖给的一面大旗，就挂在调度室里。那时，最高日产量达到三千七百吨，而今天，人们的雄心是四千三百吨！
    小黄话音未落，门外又跑进来一个小伙子：
    “四千三百不成问题！二十号炉马上出钢！”
    “这么快！”人们不约而同地叫起来。这是二十号平炉今天炼出的第三炉快速钢。
    小黄使劲一拍掌。
      “好！现在就看二十四号平炉这最后一炉钢了！”
    二十四号平炉上，人比往常多了一倍。从各座平炉派来支援的小伙子们在工长马玉发亲自指挥下作战。这位在炼钢炉旁工作了二十多年的老工人，本来今天下午四点就该下班，可是直到深夜还没回家。两位党委书记刚在公司开完会，也兴冲冲地赶来了。化验室的姑娘以前很少到平炉上来，今天都挟着两把钳子亲自来取钢样。在炉子的另一旁，摄影记者对好了角度，广播记者打开了录音机……人们都在等着那最后的决定性的一刹那。
    炉长吴家让在众目注视下，大步走到炉前，透过蓝镜片，向炉内望去。钢水由红转白，不住地翻滚着，冒出均匀的泡沫，熔化很快就要结束。吴家让忽然觉得心跳得很急。
    上一炉钢出完已经是下午十三点钟。二十四点以前能不能再出一炉钢，在许多人心里还是个疑问。过去最高纪录是十二小时，现在只有十一小时，而且是两班合炼一炉钢……吴家让知道：如果这一炉钢出不来，“四喜”就根本不会“临门”了。于是他召集小伙子们开了个会：说什么也得把这炉钢撵出来！
    接过班，条件很好，上一班装料，时间比平日缩短了一半。吴家让领着小伙子们猛干，又把兑铁水时间缩短一半。现在，关键就在熔毕碳了，料是上一班配的，如果熔毕碳过高，一切就会徒劳，人们说两班合炼不能搞快速，原因就在这儿。
      “钢样已送去化验了，会怎么样呢？”吴家让注视着钢水，心里想。
    “熔毕碳十八，兑一罐铁水就可以出钢啦！”来自化验室的声音使大家的紧张心情一下子松弛下来，欢乐好像决了堤的水直泻而下，人群沸腾了。吊车吼叫着，把早已准备好的铁水送到炉前，银笛声中，只见铁水飞溅起万朵银花，徐徐注入炉内。和这同时，平炉台上响起了锣鼓声。铸锭工段抬着大字报来告诉平炉：
      “出钢吧，一切都准备好了。”
    出钢的钟声响了。小黄激动的声音压过钟声告诉人们：今天班产四炉，日产量四千三百三十三点八吨，最后一炉钢熔炼时间十小时二十五分，三个新纪录加上提前三天完成月计划：“四喜”全部来到了炼钢厂。
