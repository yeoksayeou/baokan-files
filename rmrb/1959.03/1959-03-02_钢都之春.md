Spring in the Steel Capital
    Gu Zhengrong, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

Time flies! Counting on my fingers, I've already spent eleven springs in the Steel Capital.

On February 19, 1948, just after the Spring Festival, the Steel Capital was liberated from the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The next morning, I followed the organization into Anshan. The scene at that time was: no vehicles or horses, few people; collapsed houses, leaky roofs, broken windows and doors; shattered blast furnaces, ruined machinery. On the streets, many people with sallow faces and thin bodies watched the People's Liberation Army and the staff with tearful smiles. At that time, the enemy ridiculed and mocked us, saying, "Let them plant sorghum next to the blast furnaces for ten or twenty years!" However, under the nurturing of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Steel Capital has grown and strengthened by leaps and bounds. On July 9, 1949, the first furnace of molten iron, like an endless red spring, surged and poured downwards, dyeing the sky of the motherland red for the first time.

Eleven years have passed. The face of the Steel Capital has been completely renewed. Ten blast furnaces stand tall like ten towering giants reaching into the clouds; twenty-four open-hearth furnaces are neatly arranged in three rows. The two mountain peaks at the top of East Anshan are long gone, and chimneys as dense as a forest cover the ground. During the day, a sea of clouds undulates; at night, the sky is full of red light. Especially after the earth-shattering year of 1958, we have arrived in the colorful year of 1959. The 150,000-strong iron and steel army is decorating the spring of 1959 with even greater ambition and aspirations, greater drive and leaps forward. Beat the leap forward drum, sound the spring welcoming horn, stride across Tianling Mountain, spread wings for a great leap forward.

　　The spring light on the mine comes early: On the first day of the Spring Festival, the East Anshan Mine achieved a high-yield record of 18,200 tons of ore per day, increasing ore production by more than 60,000 tons in the first half of the month. On "February 2nd, the dragon raises its head," the Dagushan Mine produced 32,200 tons of ore. This is called: A spring thunderclap, tens of thousands of tons of high yield.

Those ten towering steel giants have been flexing their muscles, sprucing themselves up, and preparing for war to produce more steel since the beginning of spring. Blast Furnace No. 2 outstandingly overfulfilled its plan by 15% in January, winning the factory championship, and is competing with Blast Furnace No. 9, which won the 1958 championship. In the first half of February, Blast Furnace No. 2 completed 106.6% of its plan, and Blast Furnace No. 9 completed 105.35% of its plan. A friendly competition of high yield and high quality is underway on the vast and flat track. Blast Furnace No. 10, known as the King of Blast Furnaces, stands alone at the forefront of the two rows of blast furnaces, looking even more robust. It has been in high spirits since the beginning of spring, and on February 15th, it created a record high of 2,180 tons per day since it was put into production. Now it is moving forward with even bigger and faster steps.

The steelmaking workers who directly fight for steel are even more energetic and ambitious, all expressing their determination to fight the most beautiful and outstanding battle in the great battle for 18 million tons of steel. The three Youth-named open-hearth furnaces – Youth Friendship Furnace, Youth Unity Furnace, and Youth No. 20 Furnace – also put forward new combat slogans and measures at the oath-taking rally of youth activists in Anshan on the 16th, dedicating all their youthful vitality to the Party. Spring light is infinitely good, steel flowers are even more vibrant, strive for a great leap forward, high quality and high yield.

The spring breeze blows the rolling mill, playing beautiful and moving music non-stop. The First Billet Mill launched a high-yield and high-quality battle, and on the first day of the Lunar New Year, it won the greatest victory in the third breakthrough of exceeding 10,000 tons of daily production, achieving "one factory becoming two factories." The First and Second Medium Plate Mills, one old and one new sister factory, after completing the January production tasks ahead of schedule, are advancing victoriously, leaping higher and higher, and both played triumphant songs in the first half of February. The First Medium Plate Mill is even more outstanding. After long-term research and hard work, it solved the most fundamental problem of rolling mill shaking and became more and more enthusiastic. For this reason, the workers specially wrote a congratulatory poem "New Atmosphere in the Old Factory":

The old factory has a new look,
A great victory was won at the beginning of the year,
The spring is warm and the flowers are infinitely good,
Strive for a full house of red in February again.

February 22 was the most prosperous and lively day in the Steel Capital since the beginning of spring. On the "Victory Square," which marks the eternal victory of the people of the Steel Capital, tens of thousands of strong and brave, well-trained iron and steel army gathered. The spring breeze shook thousands of red flags, which looked even more colorful and vibrant under the warm sunshine. From the red sea of people, from the mines, smelting, rolling mills... from all fronts, the battle songs that resounded through the clouds and the oaths that shook the valleys were sung: resolutely guarantee the early completion of this year's arduous and glorious steel production tasks! Offer gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, and offer gifts to Chairman Mao!

Anshan, the Steel Capital of the motherland, is also a spring where hundreds of flowers bloom forever. Look at the overwhelming soaring drive, listen to the earth-shattering heroic words and magnificent and moving singing... Ah! It is not an exaggeration to say that every day is like the New Year, and everywhere is spring. The only difference is: this year's spring is more beautiful, and the spring colors are more charming.

    钢都之春
    鞍山钢铁公司副经理  谷正荣
    时间过的真快，屈指一算，我在钢都已经度过了十一个春天。
    1948年2月19日，春节刚过，钢都从国民党反动派的黑暗统治下解放了。次日早晨我随着机关进入鞍山，那时的情景是：车马绝迹，人烟寥寥；屋塌房漏，窗破门残；高炉破碎，机器坏完。街上，很多面黄肌瘦的人群，以含着泪水的笑眼，注视着解放军和工作人员。当时，敌人曾经这样的讽刺和挖苦我们说：“十年、二十年，让他们永远在高炉旁边去种高粱吧！”可是，钢都，在共产党和毛主席的抚育下，一日千里的成长壮大起来了。1949年7月9日，第一炉铁水，像是滔滔不绝的红泉，汹涌澎湃的向下喷吐和倾泻，第一次染红了祖国的天空。
    十一年过去了。钢都的面貌早已完全焕然一新。十座高炉犹如十个摩天巨人耸立云霄；二十四座平炉整整齐齐的排成三行。东鞍山顶端的两座山峰早已不见，密如森林的烟囱布满地面。白天，一片云海荡漾；入夜，满天红光闪闪。特别是经过了惊天动地的1958年，来到了万花似锦的1959年，十五万钢铁大军，正以更大的雄心和壮志，更大的干劲和跃进，装点着1959年的春天。敲起跃进鼓，吹响迎春号，拔步跨天岭，展翅大飞跃。
                    矿山上的春光来得早：东鞍山矿在春节第一天就出现了日产矿石一万八千二百吨的高产纪录，上半个月增产矿石六万余吨。“二月二，龙抬头”，大孤山矿就在这一天高产矿石三万二千二百吨。这叫做：春雷一声响，高产数万吨。
    那顶天而立的十个钢铁巨人，入春以来，就都在摩拳擦掌、修容整装，为生产更多的钢铁而备战。二号高炉1月份出色地超额完成计划15％，夺得了全厂冠军，正在和荣获1958年冠军的九高炉比武。2月上半月二高炉完成计划一百零六点六，九高炉完成计划一百零五点三五，一场高产优质的友谊赛，正在辽阔平坦的跑道上进行。号称高炉王的十号高炉，独自立在两排高炉的最前面，显得更加魁梧，入春以来精神焕发，在2月15日创造了投入生产以来日产二千一百八十吨的最高纪录。现在正以更大更快的步伐向前迈进。
    直接为钢而战的炼钢工人，更是干劲十足，志气昂扬，都表示要在为一千八百万吨钢的大战中，打个最漂亮最出色的仗。三座青年号平炉——青年友谊炉、青年团结炉、青年二十号炉，又在16日的全鞍钢青年积极分子代表誓师大会上，提出新的战斗口号和措施，把青春的活力，全部献给党。春光无限好，钢花更鲜艳，力争大跃进，优质又高产。
    春风吹动着轧钢机，分秒不停地演奏着美妙动人的音乐。第一初轧厂掀起了高产优质大战，在大年初一头一天，就夺到了“一厂变两厂”的第三次突破日产万吨大关的最大胜利。第一、第二两个中板厂，是一老一新的姊妹厂，在提前完成1月份的生产任务后，乘胜前进，越跃越高，2月上半月又都奏了凯歌。第一中板厂更是出色，经过长期钻研苦干，解决了最根本性的轧机晃荡问题后，越干越起劲。为此，工人同志特题了一首“老厂新气象”的贺诗：
    老厂又出新气象，年初打了大胜仗，
    春暖花开无限好，再争二月红满堂。
    2月22日，是钢都入春以来最红火热闹的一天。标志着钢都人民永远走向胜利的“胜利广场”上，聚集着数万坚强勇敢、久经锻炼的钢铁大军。春风摇动着万面红旗，在暖和的阳光照耀下，显得更加鲜艳多彩。从红色的人的海洋上，从矿山、冶炼、轧钢……各个阵地上，唱出了响彻云霄的战歌，发出了震撼山谷的誓言：坚决保证提前完成今年的艰巨而又光荣的钢的生产任务！向国庆十周年献礼，向毛主席献礼！
    鞍山，祖国的钢都，这儿也永远是百花盛开的春天。你看那排山倒海的冲天干劲，你听那震天动地的豪言壮语，豪迈动人的嘹亮歌声……啊！说她是日日如过年，处处是春天，一点也不夸大。所不同的是：今年的春光更秀丽，春色更媚人罢了。
