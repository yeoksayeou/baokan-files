Xinhua News Agency, March 17th - The national broadcast conference on high-yield and high-quality competition among steel workers has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the capital's steel front workers to strive for the top in the steel battle.

    After listening to the conference broadcast, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company were all in high spirits and expressed their determination to complete this year's leap forward plan. The young blast furnace workers of the company proposed to launch a friendly competition with the young blast furnace workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Plant No. 1. Their slogan is: "The east wind drums up heroic courage, bravely break through the leap forward barrier, ensure the realization of the leap forward plan, learn from Benxi and catch up with Anshan!" Under the slogan of "Great battle in the three months of spring, strive for a red entire season," the workers of Beijing Steel Plant have launched a production upsurge centered on improving the utilization coefficient.
    The workers of the Dahongmen Steel Rolling Plant, who had already completed the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule, listened to the broadcast while throwing themselves into the fierce battle. Shi Fangjin, Zhu Fenglin, and other heating furnace repair workers in the third workshop were full of energy and completed the maintenance task one day ahead of schedule at 10:30 p.m. on the 16th. After listening to the broadcast, the small blast furnace workers of Shahe Iron Plant immediately held a meeting to study how to increase the daily output from the usual six tons to ten tons. Shanghai
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 17th - The national broadcast conference on high-yield and high-quality competition among steel workers greatly boosted the morale of Shanghai's 100,000 steel workers.
    The open hearth workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which is conducting a friendly competition with Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, the national open hearth high-yield red banner unit, produced a furnace of steel in 5 hours and 16 minutes on the 16th, creating a new record since March. The average daily output of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 in the first half of the month was more than four tons higher than in February, and they are striving to keep the national open hearth high-yield red banner flying at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. The blast furnace workshop, which was put into production on the 12th, created a new record of 213 tons on the 16th, an increase of more than 50 tons over the average daily output in the previous few days.
    After the broadcast conference, the workers of various steel plants in Shanghai further discussed and revised new indicators and new measures, determined to join hands with steel workers across the country in this hot high-yield and high-quality competition movement to jointly strive to complete and overfulfill the glorious task of 18 million tons of steel. Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 17th - More than 40,000 workers on the steel front in Tianjin listened to the national broadcast conference on high-yield and high-quality competition among steel workers on the 16th and were greatly encouraged.

    Starting in the afternoon of the 16th, the workers of various steel plants held meetings to revise plans, supplement measures, and propose new competition conditions, further launching a "six comparisons" competition between plants and between groups. The workers of Tianjin Steel Plant re-revised the guarantee conditions, determined to strive for a greater leap forward in the annual steel output than last year under the condition of increasing production without increasing personnel, reducing costs by 17% compared with last year, increasing the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces from the current 6.75 to 12.5, and requiring the life of converters to reach 85 furnaces in the fourth quarter. Anshan
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 17th - With the holding of the national broadcast conference on high-yield and high-quality competition among steel workers, the "high-yield, high-quality, multi-variety" red banner competition wave of the broad masses of workers in Anshan Iron and Steel Company is surging even higher.
    Yesterday, more than 70,000 workers from various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company listened to the broadcast of the broadcast conference in more than 400 venues. After the meeting, the teams and groups of various factories and mines held meetings to discuss, revise, and formulate new competition conditions. Li Zhongmao, the foreman of No. 2 blast furnace, said that No. 2 blast furnace will not only guarantee the completion of the March pig iron production plan but also improve month by month. They decided to produce 150 tons more pig iron every day. The Youth Solidarity Furnace of the Second Steelmaking Plant once again created a record of producing 1,000 tons of steel per day on the day of the broadcast conference and ensured high output every day and every ten days, completing the March plan two days ahead of schedule and increasing the production of 2,000 tons of high-quality steel.
    The workers in mining, sintering, coking, and machine repair departments also expressed their determination to ensure that the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces are well-fed and obtain the victory in the red banner competition. Chongqing
