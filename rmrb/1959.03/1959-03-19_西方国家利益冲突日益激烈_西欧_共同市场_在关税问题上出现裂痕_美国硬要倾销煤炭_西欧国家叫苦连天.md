    Reported by this newspaper: Amidst the gradually deepening economic crisis in Western Europe, cracks have already appeared within the six nations of the European "Common Market," only two and a half months after its establishment.

    According to news from the Swiss "Voice of Labor," the six "Common Market" nations announced three months ago that they would mutually reduce tariff rates by 10% in order to make the circulation of goods between the six countries more "easy" and "free." However, these countries are quietly taking some administrative or tax measures to offset and undermine this agreement. After West Germany reduced import duties on coffee from "member states" according to the agreement, it immediately increased the coffee consumption tax in proportion to the reduction in import duties. As a result, imported coffee became more expensive than before, thereby hitting the exporters of "friendly countries" even harder. Although the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg reduced and eliminated some tariffs on wine, they levied a manufacturing tax on wine products at the same rate. At the same time, these three car-importing countries are also preparing to increase the luxury tax levied on automobiles, the increased tax amount of which will be equal to the tariff reduction on imported cars. This actually means that there has been no reduction in import duties on Italian, West German, and French cars.

    Customs authorities in most "Common Market" member states have also taken measures to make customs clearance procedures for imported goods more complicated. For example, when goods pass through the "internal" borders of the "Common Market," it is necessary to present "certificates of origin" and so-called "free circulation certificates," and so on.

    The above situation has caused concern among some responsible people in the "Common Market." They believe that this behavior of disguised sabotage of the agreement has led to a real economic war unfolding between the countries of the European "Common Market."

    Reported by this newspaper: When coal is piled up at the pitheads of various mines in the six countries of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community," many mines are being closed, the coal mining industry is facing unprecedented disaster, and a large number of unemployed miners are seeking relief, Washington has repeatedly warned the "Coal and Steel Community" countries that if Europe reduces coal imports from the United States, the United States may take retaliatory measures: reducing aid to Europe and reducing imports of automobiles from continental Western Europe, especially the import of small cars from West Germany, Italy, and France.

    There is a reason why the U.S. government is rushing to issue these warnings. In order to save itself, the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" has recently been recommending reducing coal imports from third countries from 32 million tons in 1958 to 14 million tons. At the same time, it is urging Italy, which relies on the United States for 44% of its coal supply, to purchase large quantities of surplus coal from the Ruhr region to solve West Germany's coal industry crisis. This has struck a blow to the U.S. plan to dump coal on the "European Coal and Steel Community" countries. Originally, since 1954, about 60% of U.S. coal exports have been to Western Europe. In 1957, the United States exported as much as 38 million tons of coal to the Coal and Steel Community countries. In 1958, it still reached 27 million tons. Therefore, if the "Coal and Steel Community" countries reduce the import volume of coal from outside the group to 14 million tons this year, it will seriously hit the U.S. coal mining industry, which had already reduced production by 20% last year.

    However, Washington's plan to transfer the U.S. coal industry crisis to Western Europe has been resolutely resisted by Western European public opinion. The Paris "Echo" on February 24 believed that the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" should have "risked displeasing American merchants" last year and stopped the continuous dumping of American coal in Europe. Because "at that time (this agency) already felt that the (coal industry) crisis was spreading throughout Europe."

    The British "Financial Times" also accused American merchants of continuously dumping coal in Europe, believing that the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" had not dared to resist U.S. pressure in the past, which was a major reason for the Western European coal industry crisis. But until now, the "High Authority" is still "somewhat weak and powerless" in dealing with this issue.

    The French weekly "International Forum" also pointed out: The "free circulation" of coal and steel stipulated by the "Coal and Steel Community" has greatly benefited American merchants. The weekly said: "The freedom of circulation of coal and steel products, especially across European borders, has made the following situation even more serious: due to this freedom, coal consumers buy from the cheapest suppliers, often from suppliers across the Atlantic (United States), thus giving rise to long-term coal supply contracts with the United States."

    However, despite the indignation of Western European public opinion, Washington is still secretly putting pressure on the "European Coal and Steel Community." The "European Coal and Steel Advisory Committee" (an organization representing the six countries' large coal producers and consumers), which met in Luxembourg on the 17th of this month, vetoed the "European Coal and Steel" "High Authority's" proposal to restrict coal production and restrict foreign coal imports due to internal divisions, with a majority of thirty votes against seven. This is obviously inseparable from the pressure exerted by Washington. However, the decision of the Advisory Committee is not binding. It is expected that there will still be fierce debates when the Ministerial Council meeting of the "Coal and Steel Community" is held next Monday to discuss this issue.

    西方国家利益冲突日益激烈
    西欧“共同市场”在关税问题上出现裂痕
    美国硬要倾销煤炭　西欧国家叫苦连天
    本报讯　在西欧经济危机逐渐深化中，成立才两个半月的欧洲“共同市场”六国内部已出现了裂痕。
    据瑞士“工人之声报”的消息，“共同市场”六国三个月前宣布要彼此削减关税税率10％，以便使六国之间商品的流通更加“容易”和“自由”。可是，这些国家都不声不响地采取一些行政或捐税措施来抵消和破坏了这个协定。西德根据协定减少了来自“成员国”的咖啡进口税后，立即按进口税所减少的比例，提高了咖啡消费税，结果使入口的咖啡比以前还贵，从而使“友邦”的出口商受到更厉害的打击。荷兰、比利时和卢森堡三国虽然降低和取消了一部分酒的关税，但又对酒制品课以同样税率的制造税。同时，这三个汽车进口国家还准备提高对汽车所课的奢侈品税，其增加的税额将等于对进口汽车所减少的关税税额，这样实际上就等于没有降低对意大利、西德和法国汽车的进口税。
      “共同市场”多数成员国的海关机构还采取了措施，使进口货的报关手续更加趋向复杂化。例如在货物通过“共同市场”“内部”国境时，必须呈验“出产地证书”和所谓“自由流通证明书”等等。
    以上情况已引起了“共同市场”一些负责人士的担忧，他们认为这种变相破坏协定的行为，使一个真正的经济战争在欧洲“共同市场”各国之间展开了。
    本报讯　当西欧“煤钢联营集团”六国的各个矿井上存煤山积、许多矿井被封闭、采煤工业遭到空前厄运，大量失业矿工在要求救济的时候，华盛顿却向“煤钢联营集团”国家接连提出了警告：如果欧洲削减从美国输入的煤炭进口，美国就可能采取报复手段：削减对欧洲的援助，并减少西欧大陆的汽车入口。特别是西德、意大利和法国的小型汽车入口。
    美国政府急忙提出这些警告不是没有原因的。“煤钢联营集团”的“高级机构”为了自救，最近正在建议把来自第三国的煤的入口从1958年的三千二百万吨减为一千四百万吨，同时，它还敦促44％的用煤依靠美国供应的意大利转而购进鲁尔区的大量过剩存煤，以解决西德的煤业危机。这就使美国向“欧洲煤钢联营集团”国家倾销煤炭的计划受到打击。原来，从1954年以来美国出口的煤就有60％左右输往西欧。1957年美国输往煤钢联营集团国家的煤高达三千八百万吨。1958年仍达二千七百万吨。因此，如果“煤钢联营集团”国家在今年把来自这个集团以外的煤的输入量减为一千四百万吨，就将使去年已减产20％的美国采煤业遭到严重的打击。
    但是，华盛顿想把美国的煤业危机转嫁到西欧的计划，遭到西欧舆论的坚决抵抗。2月24日的巴黎“回声报”就认为“煤钢联营集团”“高级机构”在去年就应该“宁愿冒险使美国商人不满”而制止美国煤炭的源源向欧洲倾销。因为“当时（这个机构）已经感觉到（煤业）危机正在扩及整个欧洲。”
    英国的“金融时报”也指责美国商人不断向欧洲倾销煤，认为“煤钢联营集团”“高级机构”过去不敢反抗美国的压力，是造成西欧煤业危机的一个主要原因，但到现在为止，“高级机构”在处理这个问题上仍“多少有些软弱无力。”
    法国的“国际论坛”周刊也指出：“煤钢联营集团”规定的煤钢“自由流通”已使美国商人占了很大便宜。这家周刊说：“煤钢产品的流通自由，特别是跨越欧洲边境的自由，已使得以下这一情况更加严重：由于这种自由，煤炭消费者便向价钱最便宜的供应商，往往是向大西洋彼岸（美国）的供应商去购买，因此产生了同美国签订煤炭长期供应合同的事情”。
    不过，尽管西欧舆论界如此愤愤不平，华盛顿却仍在暗中对“欧洲煤钢联营集团”施加压力。本月17日在卢森堡举行会议的“欧洲煤钢联营谘询委员会”（代表六国煤的大生产商、消费商的一个组织）由于内部分歧，又以三十票对七票的多数否决了“欧洲煤钢联营”“高级机构”的限制煤产量和限制外国煤进口的建议。这显然是同华盛顿所加的压力不可分。但谘询委员会的决定没有约束力，预计下星期一举行“煤钢联营集团”部长理事会会议讨论这个问题时，仍会有激烈争论。
