Reviewing the Achievements of Surveying and Mapping Work
Closing of the PLA Surveying and Mapping Advanced Workers Conference

(Our report) The Advanced Workers Representative Conference of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously concluded in Beijing on the 8th. This conference reviewed the achievements of national defense surveying and mapping work last year, extensively exchanged experiences, and played a positive mobilizing role in the army's better completion of this year's surveying and mapping tasks.

During the conference, Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, attended and spoke, encouraging all representatives to make greater achievements in the cause of national defense surveying and mapping.

Zhao Zhiyan, Deputy Director of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau, spoke at the closing ceremony. He called on everyone to continue to exert great effort, strive for the top, vigorously carry out technical innovation, and launch the "one specialty, multiple skills" movement, striving for faster development of national defense surveying and mapping work under the premise of ensuring quality.

In the past year, national defense surveying and mapping work has achieved unprecedented development. Map compilation, drawing, printing, and other operations have all brilliantly overfulfilled their tasks. In the technical innovation movement, the bureau proposed more than 20,000 inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, many of which have been adopted and promoted, promoting the development of the national defense surveying and mapping cause.

More than 400 representatives of advanced surveying and mapping workers and advanced units attended this conference. They are all heroes who have fought tirelessly in remote mountains and wilderness areas for many years. They, along with the broad masses of officers, soldiers, and civilian workers, have made outstanding contributions to national defense surveying and mapping work. Yang Dingguo, a technical assistant from a certain unit who participated in the conference, put forward ten important rationalization proposals last year, including a graphic solution for longitude and latitude that he created in cooperation with an engineer, which can enable surveying soldiers to quickly master new technologies and improve work efficiency by more than one time.

The conference lasted for five days. During the conference, seventeen representatives of advanced units and advanced individuals gave typical reports. The National Defense Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology Innovation Exhibition also opened during the conference.

    检阅测绘工作成就
    解放军测绘先进工作者会议闭幕
    本报讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部测绘局先进工作者代表大会8日在北京胜利闭幕。这次大会检阅了去年国防测绘工作的成就、广泛地交流了经验，并对全军更好地完成今年的测绘工作任务起了良好的动员作用。
    会议期间，国防部长彭德怀元帅到会讲了话，勉励全体代表在国防测绘事业中作出更大的成就。
    测绘局副局长赵之焱在闭幕会上讲话。他号召大家要继续鼓足干劲、力争上游、大搞技术革新、开展“一专多能”运动，在保证质量的前提下，争取国防测绘工作更高速度的发展。
    去年一年中，国防测绘工作有了空前的发展。地图编绘和制印等各项业务都出色地超额完成了任务。在技术革新运动中，全局提出发明创造和合理化建议二万多件，其中许多件已经被采纳和推广，推动了国防测绘事业的发展。
    出席这次大会的共有四百多名测绘先进工作者和先进单位的代表。他们都是长年累月地奋战在荒山旷野中的英雄。他们和广大官兵、民工一起，在国防测绘工作中，作出了卓越的贡献。参加大会的某部技术助理员杨定国，去年提出了重要的合理化建议十件，其中他和一个工程师合作创造的经纬图解法，可以使测量兵很快掌握新技术，提高工作效率一倍以上。
    这次大会共开了五天，会议期间，十七名先进单位代表和先进人物作了典型报告。国防测绘科学技术革新展览会也在会议期间开幕。
