Xinhua News Agency report:

    The Ministry of Commerce recently convened a national conference on native products and waste materials, deciding to vigorously carry out the acquisition, allocation, and exchange of native products and waste materials to serve the realization of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, promote the development of diverse economies in the people's communes, and further arrange market supply.
    The meeting pointed out that serving the completion of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton and arranging the domestic market are the two central tasks of the commercial departments in 1959. The acquisition of native products and waste materials must also be carried out around these two central tasks. There are many varieties of native products and waste materials, most of which are closely related to industrial and agricultural production. For example, scrap copper, scrap tin-lead, scrap iron and steel, saltpeter, charcoal, rosin, and turpentine are indispensable materials for supporting steel production; moso bamboo, palm fiber, saltpeter, reed mats, grass bags, and various bamboo, willow, and vine woven products are important materials for farmland water conservancy construction and agricultural production materials. In order to support the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, commercial departments must actively take measures to promote the production of these commodities in the people's communes and do a good job in the acquisition and allocation of these commodities, supplying them to industrial and agricultural departments in a timely manner, as well as meeting the needs of people's lives.
    According to the needs of the state and the market, the meeting preliminarily determined that the total purchase value of native products and waste materials this year would be 5.2 billion yuan, an increase of 25% compared with 1958. At the meeting, a total of 426 contracts and agreements were signed for three types of materials, with a total value of more than 110 million yuan. These included more than 200 kinds of various packaging containers, bamboo, willow, and vine woven products, auxiliary materials for capital construction, and summer cooling goods.
    Cheng Zihua, Minister of Commerce, spoke at the meeting. After comprehensively elaborating on the achievements of commercial work in 1958 and the tasks for 1959, he emphasized the importance of holding materials exchange conferences at each level under the new situation of people's communization. He pointed out that due to the people's communes in the countryside, tremendous changes have taken place in the relations of production. The people's communes have adopted a policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, self-sufficient production and commodity production, and are more organized and planned in arranging production and allocating labor; no matter what product is produced, it will fail if it is not included in the plan. Therefore, materials exchange meetings must be held at each level from the central government to the provinces, special districts, and counties. On the one hand, production should be planned and contracts signed according to the needs of the country and the possibilities of the people's communes to guide and promote the development of commune production. On the other hand, various materials should be organized, acquired, allocated, and distributed in a planned manner to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives in many ways. Among them, holding a good materials exchange meeting at the county level is particularly important. Cheng Zihua requested that provinces and counties should each hold a materials exchange meeting in March and April this year to develop production and organize supply in a planned manner.
    This meeting was held in Beijing from February 16th to March 1st. (Attached picture)

    开好物资交流大会促进生产发展
    商业部决定大收土产废品
    据新华社讯　商业部最近召开全国土产、废品会议，决定大力做好土产、废品的收购、调拨和交流等工作，为实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标服务，并促进人民公社多种经济的发展，进一步安排好市场供应。
    会议指出：为完成钢煤粮棉四大指标服务、安排好国内市场，是商业部门1959年的两项中心任务，土产、废品的收购工作也必须围绕着这两项中心任务来进行。土产、废品的品种很多，其中大部分与工、农业生产有密切关系。如杂铜、废锡铅、废钢铁、火硝、木炭、松香、松节油等是支援钢铁生产不可缺少的物资；毛竹、棕片、火硝、苇席、草袋，以及各种竹、柳、荆编制品，是兴修农田水利的重要器材和农业生产资料。为了支援钢、煤、粮、棉的生产，商业部门必须积极采取措施，促进人民公社对这一类商品的生产，并做好这些商品的收购、调拨工作，及时供应工、农业部门，以及供应人民生活需要。
    会议根据国家和市场的需要，初步确定今年土产、废品采购总值为五十二亿元，比1958年增加25％。会上共签订了三类物资的合同和协议四百二十六份，金额达一亿一千多万元。其中包括各种包装容器、竹柳荆草编制品、基本建设的辅助材料、夏季凉货等二百多种。
    商业部部长程子华在会上讲了话，他在全面地阐述了1958年商业工作的成就和1959年的任务后，着重指出在人民公社化的新形势下，逐级召开物资交流会的重要意义。他指出，由于农村人民公社化，生产关系发生了巨大的变化。人民公社在发展生产上采取了工业和农业、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，对生产的安排和劳动力的分配更有组织、有计划；无论什么产品生产如果不包括在计划之内就会落空。因此从中央到省、专区、县必须逐级举行物资交流会，一方面根据国家的需要和人民公社的可能，规划生产、签订合同，指导与促进公社的生产发展；另一方面，有计划地组织收购、调拨和分配各种物资，多方面地满足工农业生产和人民生活的需要。其中，尤以开好县一级的物资交流会为重要。程子华要求今年3、4月份省和县都要分别召开一次物资交流会，有计划地发展生产、组织供应。
    这次会议是2月16日到3月1日在北京举行的。（附图片）
