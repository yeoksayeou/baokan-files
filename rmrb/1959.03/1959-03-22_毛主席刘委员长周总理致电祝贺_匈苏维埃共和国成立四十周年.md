Xinhua News Agency, March 21st. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council sent a telegram to the Hungarian party and state leaders congratulating them on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows:

    To Comrade János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Comrade István Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, Comrade Ferenc Munnich, Premier of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government:

    On the occasion of the Hungarian people commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, extend our warm and fraternal greetings to you and, through you, to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and the Hungarian people.

    Forty years ago, under the leadership of the Hungarian Communist Party, the Hungarian people established the Soviet Republic in Hungary, following the Great October Socialist Revolution. This was a major event of historical significance. Although it only lasted for one hundred and thirty-three days and was defeated by the combined offensive of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces, this revolutionary struggle fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of the Hungarian people, was a great encouragement to the working people of all countries who were striving for freedom and liberation at the time, and enriched the experience of the international communist movement.

    After a long and tortuous heroic struggle, the Hungarian people finally regained their liberation fourteen years ago with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army. Inheriting the glorious revolutionary traditions of the past, the Hungarian people have been building their socialist motherland with hard work. In a very short period of time, Hungary has become an advanced industrial and agricultural country. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people have made brilliant achievements in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, developing the national economy, and improving the material and cultural life of the working people. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, which have always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism, have unswervingly struggled to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, oppose modern revisionism, and have made significant contributions to preventing imperialist war conspiracies and safeguarding the cause of European and world peace.

    The people of China and Hungary have long forged a deep fraternal friendship in the revolutionary struggle. The lofty ideal of building socialism-communism closely unites the people of our two countries. The Chinese people have always paid close attention to the struggle of the Hungarian people with great concern and are overjoyed by their great achievements. On this historic day commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, we firmly believe that the Hungarian people will continue to achieve new and greater successes in the cause of building socialism and defending peace, and we sincerely wish that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Mao Zedong
    Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China Liu Shaoqi
    Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai
            March 19, 1959, in Beijing

    毛主席刘委员长周总理致电祝贺
    匈苏维埃共和国成立四十周年
    新华社21日讯　中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国毛泽东主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会刘少奇委员长和国务院总理周恩来致电匈牙利党和国家领导人祝贺匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年。贺电全文如下：匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔·亚诺什同志，匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比·伊斯特万同志，匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨同志：
    值此匈牙利人民纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年的时候，我们谨代表中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向你们，并且通过你们向匈牙利社会主义工人党、匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府和匈牙利人民致以热烈的、兄弟般的敬意。
    四十年前，匈牙利人民在匈牙利共产党的领导下，继伟大的十月社会主义革命之后，在匈牙利建立了苏维埃共和国。这是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。虽然它只存在了一百三十三天就在国内外反革命力量的联合进攻下失败了，但是这次革命斗争充分表现了匈牙利人民的革命精神，对当时正在争取自由解放的各国劳动人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，并且丰富了国际共产主义运动的经验。
    匈牙利人民经过长期曲折的英勇斗争终于在十四年前，在苏联红军的援助下，重新赢得了解放。匈牙利人民继承了过去光荣的革命传统，以辛勤的劳动建设自己的社会主义祖国，在很短时间内，匈牙利已经变成了一个先进的工业农业国。近年来，匈牙利人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党的正确领导下，在巩固无产阶级专政、发展国民经济和提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活方面取得了光辉的成就。一贯忠于马克思列宁主义的匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府，始终不渝地为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、反对现代修正主义而斗争，并且对制止帝国主义战争阴谋，维护欧洲和世界和平事业作出了重大贡献。
    中匈两国人民早就在革命斗争中结成了深厚的兄弟友谊。建设社会主义—共产主义的崇高理想把我们两国人民紧密地团结在一起。中国人民一向以极大的关怀注视着匈牙利人民的斗争，并且为他们的伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。在纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年的历史性的日子里，我们坚信匈牙利人民在建设社会主义和保卫和平的事业中将不断获得新的、更大的成就，并且衷心地祝贺中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊日益巩固和发展。
