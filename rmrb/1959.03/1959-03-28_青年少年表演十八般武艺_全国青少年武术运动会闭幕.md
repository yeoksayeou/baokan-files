National Youth Martial Arts Games Close

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch The 1959 National Youth Martial Arts Games closed on the 27th. The games began on the 22nd in Beijing, with one hundred and eighty-nine young male and female athletes from twenty-four units, including provinces, municipalities directly under the central government, and autonomous regions, participating. By the afternoon of the 25th, all team competitions, individual all-around, and individual events had concluded. Award performances were held on the 25th, 26th, and 27th during the closing ceremony.

In the team competition, the Beijing team, whose members had relatively balanced technical skills, won first place in the overall team score. The teams ranked second to sixth in the overall team score were: Jilin Team, Shanghai Team, Shandong Team, Anhui Team, and Heilongjiang Team.

The most outstanding performers in the individual competitions were Han Mingnan, a thirteen-year-old junior high school student from the Jilin Team, and Li Fumei, a seventeen-year-old junior high school student from the Shanghai Team. Han Mingnan not only won the all-around champion in the youth group with a total score of 24.99 (out of a possible 30), but also won two individual titles in the youth group long fist and long weapon categories with scores of 8.43 and 8.36 respectively. In addition to winning the all-around champion in the youth group with a total score of 33.26 (out of a possible 40), Li Fumei also won the youth group long fist competition with a score of 8.4.

In the youth group Taijiquan competition, the champion was Pan Shuyi, a nineteen-year-old worker from the Nanning Garment Factory in the Guangxi Team. She scored 8.66 out of a possible 10, setting the highest individual score in this sports meet.

An Tianrong from the Jilin Team and Yang Sengbao from the Beijing Team won the short weapon and weapon categories in the youth group, respectively. An Tianrong's performance of "Dragon Shape Sword" scored 8.63, and Yang Sengbao's performance of "Qimei Staff" scored 8.36.

The Taijiquan competition in the youth group was very intense. Xu Yuru, a fourteen-year-old female athlete from the Shaanxi Team, and Zhang Haifeng, a fifteen-year-old female athlete from the Shanghai Team, both scored 8.33. However, Zhang Haifeng won first place because her overall all-around score was higher than Xu Yuru's. In the short weapon competition, Fan Gui'e, a twelve-year-old female athlete from the Shandong Team, won the championship. Her performance of "Eight Immortals Sword" scored 8.26, making her the youngest national champion in this sports meet. (Attached pictures)
