Xinhua News Agency, March 29th—People from all walks of life in the capital resolutely support the State Council's measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion and disband the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. They unanimously condemn the towering crimes of the Tibetan reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to betray the motherland and carry out the rebellion.

Since the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the State Council's order and Xinhua News Agency's public announcement regarding the Tibetan rebellion on the evening of the 28th, workers, farmers, students, teachers, government cadres, and street residents in the capital have held discussions. Some have also written letters to the commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are fighting the Tibetan rebels to express their condolences.

The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, who once supported the Tibetan people with a large number of combine harvesters, horse-drawn plows, and other agricultural tools, held a discussion. Yang Tingru, a worker in the processing workshop, said at the meeting: The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the rebels are wise and correct measures to safeguard the unity of the motherland and strengthen national unity. Zuo Shijun, an old "February 7th" worker from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, said: The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, betrayed the motherland, and carried out a rebellion. Their crimes are heinous.

Commune members in the suburbs expressed immense indignation at the Tibetan reactionary clique's treasonous crimes. Wang Cai, an old peasant from the Lugouqiao People's Commune who had worked as a hired laborer for many years in the old society, said: The government is doing the right thing. We must eliminate the Tibetan rebels. These reactionary guys want to keep using farmers and herdsmen as beasts of burden forever. That will never work.

Teachers and students from many schools, including Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Petroleum Institute, also held discussions yesterday evening and today. After hearing the news from the broadcast, teachers and students of Beijing Normal College were filled with indignation and immediately wrote a letter to the newspaper expressing their firm support for the State Council's order and the suppression of Tibetan rebels. Xiao Zhang, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said: The central government's policy towards Tibet is in line with the interests of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people support the Central People's Government, which is patriotic. The long-planned Tibetan traitors violated the will and wishes of the Tibetan people and openly colluded with imperialism to betray the motherland and carry out a rebellion. Such crimes cannot be tolerated.

An Shiwei, the Ahong of the Niujie Mosque in Beijing, expressed great indignation at the armed rebellion instigated by the Tibetan reactionary clique. He said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique are madly colluding with imperialism to carry out an armed rebellion, undermining the unity of the motherland and national unity, which is truly a heinous crime. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and instruct the People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion is entirely correct." An Shiwei said: "The Tibetan rebel group is the scum of the Tibetan people. They are the enemies of the Tibetan people. If the Tibetan people want to achieve complete liberation and embark on the bright road of socialism, they must thoroughly eliminate these scums."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 29th—People from all walks of life in Shanghai are filled with righteous indignation at the crimes of the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to betray the motherland. The broad masses of workers, students, government cadres, and citizens expressed their firm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. They solemnly pointed out that the criminal acts of the Tibetan rebel group are intolerable by national law. People unanimously believe that, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of patriotic people from all sectors of Tibetan society, our heroic People's Liberation Army will quickly and thoroughly quell the rebellion. The Tibetan rebellion has promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unity and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

Han Xinliang, a steelmaking worker at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, said: Last year, when I attended the National Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction, the Tibetan representatives all spoke of the Tibetan monks and lay people's heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party. However, this small group of reactionaries violated the wishes of the Tibetan people, launched an armed rebellion, and undermined the unity of the motherland, which is truly a heinous crime. The People's Liberation Army, with the assistance of patriotic monks and lay people in Lhasa, quickly quelled the rebellion in Lhasa, which once again shows that the Tibetan people have unlimited love for the Communist Party.

Teachers and students from Fudan University and East China Normal University listened to the news broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station last night. Many immediately held discussions and wrote big-character posters, enthusiastically supporting the State Council's wise and decisive measures. Many commercial workers and street residents also expressed their firm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion. Yin Liqun, an advanced worker in the city and a saleswoman in the clothing department of Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, said that the fact that the Lhasa rebellion was quickly quelled shows that the Tibetan reactionaries are only a minority, and the vast majority of Tibetan compatriots are patriotic and support the Central People's Government.

Venerable Chi Song, President of the Shanghai Buddhist Association and Abbot of Jing'an Temple, and Venerable Wei Fang, Vice President and Abbot of Jade Buddha Temple, said: We and the Buddhists in Shanghai sincerely support the government's wise measures to quickly quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that betrayed the motherland. The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, persecuted the people, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and carried out a rebellion. Upon hearing the news, we were filled with indignation. The central government has been magnanimous and has tolerated these people many times in order to wait for their awakening, but they have mistaken the central government's attitude of benevolence and righteousness as weakness and vulnerability. Finally, they betrayed the motherland, undermined unity, and launched a rebellion, which is self-destruction.

At a joint meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce held this afternoon, the members also expressed great indignation at the Tibetan reactionary group's premeditated treasonous acts that undermine national unity, and expressed their firm support for the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 29th—People from all walks of life in Tianjin warmly support the State Council's order and the People's Liberation Army's swift quelling of the Lhasa rebellion.

The workers of the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant unanimously condemned the crimes of the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to betray the motherland. Many workers held discussions on this matter. Du Baosen, a stoker who was making steel next to the open-hearth furnace, said, "We hope that the PLA troops stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan monks and lay people who assisted in quelling the rebellion will continue to eliminate the rebels. We steelworkers and the people of the whole country resolutely support them."

Several thousand students from Tianjin University held discussions after reading today's newspaper. Students from the civil engineering major, such as Tian Jian, Zhang Yimin, and Li Mingzhen, all believed in their speeches that the State Council's order represents the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The fact that the rebellion in Lhasa was quickly quelled proves that the policy of the Central People's Government has been supported by the broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people and patriotic and progressive people of the upper and middle classes.

Zhang Guofan, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and a scientist, said: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique betrayed the motherland, which violates the interests of the broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people. Clearing out these reactionaries is like removing a boil, which will accelerate the construction of Tibet and enable the Tibetan people to advance together with other ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland." He also warned the imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries that any conspiracy to split Tibet is doomed to complete bankruptcy.

Wang Guangying, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique regarded the central government's attitude of benevolence and righteousness as weakness and vulnerability, but they miscalculated. The result will only hasten their demise and enable the Tibetan people to embark on a bright path.

    北京上海天津各界人民纷纷集会
    拥护政府命令  扫清西藏叛匪
    祝贺西藏开始民主和社会主义新时期
    据新华社29日讯　首都各界人民坚决拥护国务院采取措施平息西藏叛乱和解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府，一致声讨西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义背叛祖国进行叛乱的滔天罪行。
    从28日晚中央人民广播电台广播了国务院命令和新华社关于西藏叛乱事件的公报以后，首都工人、农民、学生、教师、机关干部和街道居民纷纷举行座谈会，有的还写信给讨伐西藏叛匪的人民解放军指战员，表示慰问。
    曾经以大量联合收割机、马拉犁等农具支援过西藏人民的北京农业机械厂职工，举行了座谈会。加工车间工人杨廷儒在会上说：国务院解散西藏地方政府的命令和人民解放军对叛匪的讨伐，是维护祖国统一，加强民族团结所采取的英明正确的措施。长辛店机车车辆工厂“二七”老工人左士俊说：西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，公开撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，背叛祖国，进行叛乱，真是罪大恶极。
    郊区人民公社社员对西藏反动集团的叛国罪行表示无比愤慨。在旧社会当过多年雇工的芦沟桥人民公社老农民王才说：政府做得很对，一定要把西藏叛匪消灭。这些反动家伙，想永远把农牧民当牛马使唤，那决不行。
    北京大学、北京师范大学、北京石油学院等许多学校的师生昨晚和今天也纷纷举行了座谈会。北京师范学院的师生从广播里听到这个消息后，群情激愤，当场给报社写信表示坚决拥护国务院命令，讨伐西藏叛乱分子。北京师范大学教授萧璋说：中央对西藏的政策是符合西藏人民的利益的，西藏人民拥护中央人民政府，是爱国的。蓄谋已久的西藏叛国分子，竟违背西藏人民的意志和愿望，公然勾结帝国主义背叛祖国进行叛乱，这种罪行是不能容忍的。
    北京牛街清真寺的阿訇安士伟，对西藏反动集团策动武装叛乱感到极大的愤慨。他说：“西藏地方政府和上层反动集团丧心病狂，勾结帝国主义，进行武装叛乱，破坏祖国统一和民族团结，实属罪恶滔天。国务院命令解散西藏地方政府和责成人民解放军平息叛乱是完全正确的。”安士伟说：“西藏叛乱集团是藏族人民中的败类，他们是藏族人民的敌人，藏族人民要想彻底解放，走向社会主义光明大道，必须把这些败类彻底全部地消灭。”
    据新华社上海29日电　上海市各界人民对西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义背叛祖国的罪行，莫不义愤填膺。广大工人、学生、机关干部和市民们表示坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令，严正指出西藏叛乱集团的罪恶行为为国法所不容。人们一致相信，在中国共产党的英明领导下，在西藏僧俗各界爱国人民的协助下，我英勇的人民解放军必将迅速彻底平息叛乱。西藏叛乱事件促进了祖国统一的巩固和西藏人民的新生。
    上钢三厂炼钢工人韩忻亮说：去年参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会时，西藏代表在发言中都谈到西藏僧俗人民从内心感激共产党。可是这一小撮反动分子，竟违反西藏人民的意愿，发动武装叛乱，破坏祖国统一，实在是罪大恶极。人民解放军在拉萨爱国僧俗人民的协助下，很快平息了拉萨的叛乱，这再一次说明西藏人民对共产党是无限爱戴的。
    复旦大学、华东师范大学师生昨天晚上都收听了中央人民广播电台发出的消息，很多人立即开座谈会，写大字报，热烈拥护国务院英明果断的措施。许多商业职工和街道居民也表示坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令。市先进工作者、上海第一百货商店服装部营业员殷立群说，拉萨叛乱被迅速平定的事实说明西藏反动分子只是少数，绝大多数藏族同胞是爱国的，拥护中央人民政府的。
    上海市佛教协会会长、静安寺主持持松法师和副会长、玉佛寺主持苇舫法师说：我们和上海的佛教徒竭诚拥护政府迅速平定西藏叛乱，解散背叛祖国的西藏地方政府的贤明措施。西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和蒋帮分子，残害人民，劫持达赖喇嘛，进行叛乱，闻讯之下，不胜愤慨，中央宽大为怀，为了等待这些分子的觉悟，曾多次容忍，而他们反把中央仁至义尽的态度认为软弱可欺，终于背叛祖国，破坏统一，发动叛乱，这是自取灭亡。
    在今天下午举行的上海市民建市委会、市工商联常委联席会议上，委员们对于西藏反动集团蓄谋背叛祖国破坏统一的罪恶行为，也表示极大的愤慨，并表示坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令。
    新华社天津29日电　天津市各界人民热烈拥护国务院命令和解放军迅速平定拉萨叛乱。
    天津第一炼钢厂的工人们，一致声讨西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义背叛祖国的罪行。许多工人为此举行了座谈会。正在平炉旁炼钢的司炉杜宝森说，我们希望人民解放军驻藏部队和协助平定叛乱的藏族僧俗人民，继续消灭叛匪。我们炼钢工人和全国人民坚决做他们的后盾。
    天津大学的几千名学生阅读了今天的报纸后，纷纷进行讨论。土木建筑学专业的学生田俭、张益民、李明真等在发言中都认为，国务院的命令代表了全国各族人民的利益。从拉萨的叛乱被迅速平定这一事实中，证明中央人民政府的政策是受到了西藏广大僧俗人民和上中层爱国进步人士的拥护。
    中国民主同盟天津市委员会主任委员、科学家张国藩说：“西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国，是违反广大藏族僧俗人民的利益的。清除了这些反动分子，就像把脓包去掉一样，就会加速西藏的建设，使西藏人民能够同祖国大家庭中的其他民族一样，共同前进。”他还警告帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派说：任何分裂西藏的阴谋都注定要彻底破产。
    天津市工商业联合会主任委员王光英说：西藏地方政府和上层反动集团把中央对他们仁至义尽的态度看作软弱可欺，但是他们这把算盘打错了，结果只是促使他们的灭亡，使西藏人民走上光明的道路。
