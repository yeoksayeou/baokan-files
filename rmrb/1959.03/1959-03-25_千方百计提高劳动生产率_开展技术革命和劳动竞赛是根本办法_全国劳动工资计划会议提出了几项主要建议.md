Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. Increasing labor productivity is the key link to realizing this year's overall Great Leap Forward plan, marked by the four major targets, given the current labor shortage. It is also the "key" of current labor management work. This was the unanimous view put forward at the National Labor and Wage Planning Conference, which closed in Beijing on the 12th.

The specific situation currently facing us in terms of labor is: on the one hand, it is necessary to guarantee the realization of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton; on the other hand, both urban and rural areas feel that there is a shortage of labor. How to resolve this contradiction? The National Labor and Wage Planning Conference believes that there is only one way out: to greatly increase the labor productivity of workers and peasants.

Last year, China's national economy, guided by steel, achieved a tremendous Great Leap Forward. The output of both steel and grain doubled, coal production exceeded that of the United Kingdom, and the scale of capital construction also greatly exceeded that of previous years. The conference believes that such a high-speed development of production and construction naturally requires an appropriate increase in labor. The current state of labor in our country has undergone a fundamental change, that is, there is no surplus labor in either urban or rural areas. Therefore, the guiding principle for compiling the labor plan this year should be: make overall arrangements for urban and rural labor, ensure the realization of the four major targets, make every effort to increase labor productivity, and strive to increase production and tasks without increasing manpower.

Regarding how to increase labor productivity, the conference put forward the following major recommendations:

One, launch mass technical revolution and socialist emulation movements. This is the most important and fundamental way to increase labor productivity. The conference believes that to eliminate the current tension in labor, we must first adopt the method of starting with indigenous methods before adopting foreign methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improving from low-level to high-level, to gradually realize semi-mechanization or mechanization in work that consumes a lot of labor and is labor-intensive. The conference believes that this is not only very necessary, but also conditional. This is especially true for areas where the labor shortage is more severe and the industrial base is relatively strong.

Two, improve labor organization and use labor rationally. The conference believes that one is to improve social labor organization, the second is to improve labor organization within enterprises, and the third is to rationally organize and use the forces of office cadres, enterprise management cadres, and military officers and soldiers to participate in physical labor. Regarding improving social labor organization, the conference believes that the main thing should be to reasonably divide labor and closely cooperate in accordance with the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game, save surplus manpower or labor that can be saved, and support key units and production and construction undertakings that urgently need labor, so that these people can exert greater strength. Improving labor organization within enterprises should reduce the proportion of non-production departments or non-direct production personnel as much as possible and increase the proportion of production departments and direct production personnel.

Three, appropriately adjust the existing workforce. The conference believes that in newly established enterprises at the special district and county levels, factories that cannot produce normally due to a lack of raw materials or excessively low production efficiency and high costs can appropriately reduce some personnel. Some newly built factories and mines that have established preparatory organizations too early and have too many production preparation personnel can also reduce some personnel depending on the situation. Reducing these personnel can not only increase the labor productivity of these units, but also meet the needs of key projects and departments urgently needed for production, as well as the needs of rural areas for labor.

The conference also pointed out that to increase labor productivity, it is necessary to correctly implement the principle of distribution according to work, while strengthening political and ideological education for workers and peasants.

    千方百计提高劳动生产率
    开展技术革命和劳动竞赛是根本办法
    全国劳动工资计划会议提出了几项主要建议
    新华社24日讯　提高劳动生产率，是在当前劳动力不足的情况下，实现今年以四大指标为标志的全面大跃进计划的主要环节，也是当前劳动力管理工作的“纲”。这是12日在北京闭幕的全国劳动工资计划会议提出的一致的看法。
    当前在劳动力问题上面对的具体情况是：一方面必需保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现，另一方面又是无论城市和农村都感到劳动力不足。矛盾如何解决？全国劳动工资计划会议认为，出路只有一条，就是大大提高工人和农民的劳动生产率。
    去年我国以钢为纲的国民经济大跃进，取得了巨大的成就。钢和粮食的产量都翻了一番，煤的产量超过了英国，基本建设的规模也大大超过往年。会议认为：生产和建设这样高速度的发展，自然要适当地增加劳动力。目前我国劳动力的状况已经发生根本变化，即无论城乡都没有劳动力过剩的现象。因此，今年编制劳动计划的方针应当是：统筹安排城乡劳动力，保证四大指标的实现，千方百计地提高劳动生产率，尽量作到增产增事不增人。
    对于如何提高劳动生产率的问题，会议提出了下列一些主要的建议：
    一、开展群众性的技术革命运动和社会主义竞赛运动。这是提高劳动生产率最重要最根本的办法。会议认为，要消除目前在劳动力方面的紧张现象，就必须首先在劳动消耗多、劳动强度高的工作方面，采用先土后洋、土洋结合、由低级到高级步步提高的办法，逐步实现半机械化或机械化。会议认为这样作不仅是十分必要的，而且也是有条件的。尤其是那些劳动力紧张程度比较严重而工业基础又比较强的地区，更需要如此。
    二、改进劳动组织，合理地使用劳动力。会议认为一是改善社会劳动组织，二是改善企业内部的劳动组织，三是合理地组织使用机关干部、企业管理干部、军队官兵参加体力劳动的力量。对于改善社会劳动组织，会议认为主要应当是按照全国一盘棋的原则，合理分工密切协作，把富余的人力或可以节约的劳动力节约下来，支援重点单位和急需劳动力的生产建设事业，使这些人发挥出更大的力量。在企业内部改进劳动组织，则应当尽可能地减少非生产部门的或非直接生产人员的比重，增加生产部门的和直接生产人员的比重。
    三、适当调整现有职工队伍。会议认为在专区和县两级新办的企业中，因缺乏原材料或生产效率过低、成本过高而不能正常生产的工厂，可以适当紧缩一部分人员。有些新建厂矿的筹建机构建立过早和生产准备人员配备过多，也可以根据情况减少一部分。把这些可以减少的人员减下来，不仅可以使这些单位的劳动生产率提高，还可以满足重点工程和生产急需部门以及农村对于劳动力的需要。
    会议还指出：提高劳动生产率，必须正确地贯彻按劳分配的原则，同时对职工和农民加强政治思想教育工作。
