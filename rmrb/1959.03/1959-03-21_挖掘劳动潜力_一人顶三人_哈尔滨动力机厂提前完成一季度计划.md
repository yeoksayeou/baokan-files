    Exploring Labor Potential: One Person Does the Work of Three
    Harbin Power Machine Plant Completes First Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Harbin Power Machine Manufacturing Plant fully explored its labor potential, achieving one person doing the work of three, and completing the first quarter plan twenty-five and a half days ahead of schedule. The Harbin Power Machine Manufacturing Plant is mainly responsible for the production of coking equipment, a key national product. Due to the heavy tasks and labor shortages, some people lacked confidence in completing the tasks on time and in sufficient quantity. The Party committee held several symposiums with veteran workers, emphasizing the situation and the favorable conditions, and also launched a campaign of oath-taking competitions. Workers put forward slogans such as: seizing time, taking the initiative, and guaranteeing the red flag to establish pacesetters. After the big competitions, the production plan leaped forward again and again. January's production increased fivefold compared to the same period last year, and increased by 2.6% compared to the high-yield month of 1958. In February, a small month, the plant accomplished the work of a large month, actually increasing by 3.9% compared to January, and increasing sevenfold compared to the same period last year. The entire quarter's plan increased fivefold compared to the same period last year, and increased by 11% compared to the highest level of the fourth quarter of 1958. Product quality improved from 98.6% in 1958 to 100%, and costs decreased by about 15%.
    This factory did not rely on increasing equipment and labor in completing the first quarter plan ahead of schedule, but instead fully tapped the potential of the enterprise, giving play to people's subjective initiative, closely relying on the masses, and using methods such as improving technology, adopting new technologies, and improving labor organization, to do everything possible to increase labor productivity by 1.7 times compared to the same period last year. Since the beginning of the year, 134 technical revolution projects have been implemented, including 29 indigenous machine tool equipment, 71 improved tools, and 8 new technologies. The implementation of these projects has increased production efficiency by one to twenty times or more. A vigorous hot processing technical revolution was launched. Through the three-in-one combination design method, three types of equipment such as sand screening and sand mixing were manufactured, increasing work efficiency by 20 times and solving the key to the supply of castings for large-scale production of diesel engines. The factory had no grinding equipment in the past. Zhou Shiheng, a labor model in the third workshop, manufactured a cylinder grinding machine to break through this barrier. Yu Xueliang manufactured a crankshaft grinder to break through the key to low efficiency in processing diesel engine crankshafts, increasing efficiency by more than one time. The Mou Zizheng team in the second workshop improved an electric saw bed and a punching machine for producing bucket elevators in order to realize the mechanization of fitters, making all fitter work mechanical.
    Through technical revolution and other methods, the average worker in the factory did the work of three people. Among them, 10% of the workers did the work of five people, and 30% of the workers reached the level of one person doing the work of four people. New workers also fully played their role. Under the patient guidance of experienced workers, more than 80% of them became as good as one, or even two equal to three in just over half a year.
    At present, with the lofty ambition of leaping forward again and again, the factory is striving to guarantee that it will do two months of work in March, overfulfilling the quarterly plan by 50%, completing 30% of the annual plan, and increasing it eightfold compared to the same period last year.

    挖掘劳动潜力  一人顶三人
    哈尔滨动力机厂提前完成一季度计划
    本报讯　哈尔滨动力机制造厂充分挖掘劳动潜力，做到一个人顶三个人，提前二十五天半完成首季计划。哈尔滨动力机制造厂主要担负着国家重点产品炼焦设备的生产。由于任务大，劳动力缺，有的人对按时按量完成任务信心不足。党委召开了几次老工人座谈会，大讲形势，大讲有利条件，又通过誓师比武，工人们纷纷提出：抢时间、争主动、保红旗立标兵的口号，经过大比大赛，生产计划一跃再跃。1月份的生产较去年同期翻五番，较1958年高产月增长2.6％，在2月份小月里干出大月活，较1月份实际提高3.9％，较去年同期翻七番。全季计划较去年同期翻五番，较1958年最高水平的第四季度提高11％。产品质量由1958年的98.6％提高到100％，成本降低15％左右。
    这个工厂在提前完成首季计划中没有依靠增加设备和劳动力，而是充分的挖掘企业潜力，发挥人的主观能动作用，紧紧地依靠群众，通过改进工艺、采用新技术、改善劳动组织等方法，千方百计使劳动生产率较去年同期提高一点七倍。从年初以来，实现各种技术革命项目一百三十四项，其中土机床设备二十九项，改进工具七十一项，采用新技术八项，这些项目的实现，使生产效率提高了一至二十倍以上。大闹热加工技术革命，通过三结合设计方法，制造了筛砂、混砂等三种设备，提高工作效率二十倍，解决了柴油机大批生产的铸件供应的关键。厂里过去根本没有磨床设备，三车间劳动模范周士珩为突破这一关，制造了一台磨缸机。于学亮为突破加工柴油机曲轴效率低的关键，制造了一台曲轴磨床提高效率一倍多。二车间牟子政小组为实现钳工机械化，改进了一台电锯床和生产斗式提升机的冲眼机，使钳工全部机械化。
    通过技术革命等方法，全厂职工平均一人干三个人的工作。其中有10％的工人一人顶五人，30％的工人达到一人顶四人。新工人亦充分地发挥作用，在老师傅的耐心指导下，仅以半年多的时间，有80％以上一个顶一个，甚至两个顶三个。
    目前，这个厂以跃进再跃进的雄心壮志，保证在3月份要干出两个月的活，为超额完成季度计划50％，完成年计划30％，较去年同期翻八番而努力。
