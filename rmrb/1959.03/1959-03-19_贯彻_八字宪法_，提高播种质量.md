Implement the "Eight-Character Charter" to Improve Sowing Quality

Spring sowing has already begun in the south, and spring sowing work in the northern provinces will also begin successively. The spring sowing season is not long, and time is tight. Striving for initiative and timely sowing is a battle of decisive significance to ensure a greater agricultural harvest this year. All localities must seize the opportunity, go all out, and complete the spring sowing task quickly and well, laying a solid foundation for a greater agricultural harvest this year.

Sowing is the foundation of a good harvest. Only when the foundation is well laid can the harvest be guaranteed. Only by sowing in a timely and good manner can field management afterwards achieve something and play a greater role. This year, China's sown area is 2.2 billion mu, of which 1 billion mu are spring-sown crops, accounting for about half of the total. The output of spring-sown grain crops accounts for more than half of the country's total grain output, and all of the cotton and most of the other cash crops such as hemp and soybeans must be sown in spring. Doing a good job in spring sowing is precisely the decisive key to ensuring the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

The great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 brought us an unprecedented bumper harvest. This is a great victory. However, the significance of the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 is even more important in that the Chinese people have found a path for the high-speed development of agricultural production, and a path for continuous leap forward. This path is to fully implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase.

Each item of the "Eight-Character Charter" has its own role, but the eight items are closely linked. Neglecting any one of them will affect the better growth of crops. Isolating each item or not proceeding from the specific circumstances of the time and place cannot fully exert the full effect of the "Eight-Character Charter." Therefore, when implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," we must not only fully implement it from beginning to end, but also pay full attention to the principles of adapting to local conditions, adapting to the time, and adapting to the crops, according to the different seasons and the different requirements of different crops. The "Eight-Character Charter" runs through the entire agricultural production process, and each production link must be implemented with emphasis and at the same time comprehensively. Sowing is one of the most important links in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter." The eight measures for increasing production: water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, and management, all need to be implemented during sowing. The lack of any one of them will affect the quality of sowing, especially soil (deep plowing), seed (improved seed), density (close planting), etc.; if the implementation is not good during sowing, the entire production process will be difficult or even impossible to remedy. Therefore, we can draw the following conclusion: to strive for a greater harvest, we need to better implement the "Eight-Character Charter," and sowing is a very important key to implementing the "Eight-Character Charter." We must follow the requirements of increasing production and implement the "Eight-Character Charter" well during sowing, in order to lay a good foundation for striving for a greater harvest.

Whether the Eight-Character Charter can be better implemented during sowing, and whether spring sowing can be done quickly and well, depends on three key factors: the issue of understanding, the issue of material preparation, and the issue of organization and leadership.

Through the practice of 1958, the vast number of cadres and the masses have recognized the tremendous role of the "Eight-Character Charter" in agricultural production, which is a very favorable condition for us to better implement the "Eight-Character Charter" this year. However, things are always moving forward, and people's understanding of the laws of development of objective things often lags behind reality. At present, our understanding of the "Eight-Character Charter" is only a beginning, and there are still many problems that require a lot of hard work; and some problems must be resolved more thoroughly before sowing in order to implement them during sowing. Many places have adopted the method of mobilizing all commune members to summarize last year's bumper harvest experience when deploying this year's production tasks, in order to improve the broad masses' understanding of the "Eight-Character Charter." This method is very good. People not only further recognize the "Eight-Character Charter" from summarizing past experience, but also find practical measures to strive for a greater harvest, and enhance their confidence in striving for a greater harvest. Only when people not only recognize the importance of the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing production, but also know how to implement the "Eight-Character Charter," can they better implement it.

The "Eight-Character Charter" is a concrete measure, and people's deep understanding of it is an important guarantee for its implementation. However, it is not enough to just achieve this step. There must also be a material guarantee. Material is concrete and real, and there must be no sloppiness. This year, all localities have grasped the work of preparing for farming more tightly and earlier than in previous years, and have achieved great results: in addition to topdressing for overwintering crops, spring-sown crops have generally accumulated more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu; more seeds have been retained than in previous years; water conservancy has also been greatly improved; in order to improve labor efficiency, all localities have actively carried out tool reforms, etc. These are all favorable conditions for us to better implement the "Eight-Character Charter" this year. But can we say that our material preparation work in all aspects has been done very well? Can we say that every commune, management area, and production team has prepared very well? We can't say that yet. Taking fertilizer as an example, more fertilizer has been accumulated this year than last year, but not every commune has enough fertilizer. There are still some places where not much fertilizer has been accumulated; especially, most of the fertilizer in many areas has not been transported to the fields. If effective measures are not taken to transport the fertilizer to the spring-sown fields as soon as possible, can we say that the fertilizer problem has been solved? There are similar situations in other aspects of material preparation, such as the preparation of seeds and the preparation of spring sowing tools. At present, all localities should conduct an emergency, comprehensive, and in-depth inspection of the material preparation work for spring sowing in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter." If there are any shortcomings or inadequacies, organize forces to solve them immediately, and be sure to ensure that the needs of sowing are met.

The greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959 requires further improvement of the quality of spring sowing. The standard is both good and fast. Good means better implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" and sowing in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter"; fast means not missing the farming season and sowing in a timely manner. According to past experience, there is a large difference in yield between timely sowing and missed sowing. The suitable sowing period for each crop is not very long. If it is not grasped tightly, it is easy to miss the suitable sowing period. Therefore, timely sowing is a tense battle, and we must seize the time and the season to successfully pass the hurdle of timely sowing. The so-called timely sowing is not unlimitedly advancing the sowing time. It is not good for some places to arbitrarily advance the sowing period without considering the type of crop and climatic characteristics. Whether it is comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" to improve sowing quality, or sowing in a timely manner, in addition to making all necessary material preparations in advance, effective organizational measures are also needed. We believe that the following issues should be given special attention: First, people's communes in all localities should further improve the commune management system in accordance with the principle of "unified leadership, graded management" proposed in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Under the unified leadership of the commune, production teams should have the necessary powers in organizing production and basic construction, managing finances, and managing living welfare undertakings, in order to better exert the enthusiasm of each production team. At present, all people's communes should first determine this year's production plan and sowing plan, and quickly implement the plan into the production teams and the broad masses of commune members, so that the production teams can formulate specific measures based on the production plan. Second, it is necessary to rationally organize labor. During the spring plowing period, rural areas in all localities should take spring plowing and sowing as the overriding center, and transfer most of the labor force from non-urgent places to the spring plowing and sowing front, to ensure that the spring sowing work that determines the bumper harvest is done well. Third, it is necessary to further improve the production responsibility system. This is an important guarantee for giving play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members and realizing the production plan perfectly. At the same time, in order to make the production responsibility system play a better role, and in order to further increase the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, while establishing a responsibility system and strengthening the Party's political and ideological work, we should conscientiously implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," so that those who work more and work better receive higher and deserved rewards.

The task of spring plowing and sowing is arduous and time is pressing. All localities should muster greater revolutionary spirit, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter," and complete the sowing task of spring crops in a timely manner, laying a solid foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

    贯彻“八字宪法”，提高播种质量
    南方已经开始春播，北方各省春播工作也将陆续开始。春播季节不长，时间紧迫。争取主动，适时播种，是保证今年农业更大丰收的有决定意义的一战。各地必须抓住时机，全力以赴，又快又好地完成春播任务，为今年农业的更大丰收打下巩固的基础。
    播种是丰收的基础，基础打好了，丰收才能有保证。只有播种得适时，播种得好，以后的田间管理才能有所作为，才能发挥更大的作用。今年我国播种面积是二十二亿亩，其中有十亿亩是春季播种作物，约占总数一半。春季播种的粮食作物产量占全国粮食总产量一半以上，而棉花的全部和其他的经济作物如麻、大豆等的绝大部分，都要在春季播种。作好春季播种工作，正是保证实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的决定性的关键。
    1958年的农业生产大跃进，使我们获得了史无前例的大丰收。这是一个伟大的胜利。但是，1958年农业大跃进的意义，更重要的是我国人民找到了农业生产高速度发展的道路，找到了不断跃进的道路。这条道路就是全面贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”。
      “八字宪法”每条有每条的作用，但八条之间又密切地联系着，忽视了其中的任何一条，都会影响农作物更好的生长。把各条孤立起来，或者不从当时当地的具体情况出发，都不能充分发挥“八字宪法”的全部功效。因此，我们在执行“八字宪法”的时候，既要自始至终全面贯彻，又要根据不同的季节，不同的作物的不同要求，充分注意因地制宜、因时制宜、因作物制宜的原则。“八字宪法”是贯串整个农业生产过程的，每个生产环节都要有重点地同时又是全面地贯彻。播种是贯彻“八字宪法”的一个最重要的环节。八条增产措施：水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管，条条都需在播种的时候贯彻，缺少其中的那一条，都要影响播种质量，特别是其中的土（深耕）、种（优种）、密（密植）等等；如果在播种的时候贯彻的不好，整个生产过程也很难甚至根本无法补救了。因此，我们可以得出这样的结论：要争取更大的丰收，就需要更好地贯彻
  “八字宪法”，播种又是贯彻“八字宪法”的一个十分重要的关键。必须在播种的时候，就要按照增产的要求，把“八字宪法”很好地贯彻下去，才能为争取更大的丰收打下良好的基础。
    能不能在播种的时候更好地贯彻八字宪法，能不能把春播工作做得又快又好，关键有三：这就是认识问题，物质准备问题和组织领导问题。
    经过1958年的实践，广大干部和群众都已经认识了“八字宪法”对农业生产的巨大作用，这是我们今年更好地贯彻“八字宪法”的十分有利的条件。但是，事物总是不停地向前发展的，人们对于客观事物的发展规律的认识又常常落后于实际。现在，我们对于“八字宪法”的认识还只是开始，还有不少问题，须要作很多的艰苦的工作；而且有些问题必须在播种以前就得到比较彻底的解决，才能在播种的时候贯彻下去。很多地方在布置今年生产任务的时候，采用发动全体社员总结去年的丰产经验的办法，来提高广大群众对“八字宪法”的认识。这个办法很好。人们从总结过去的经验中不仅更进一步地认识了“八字宪法”，同时也找到了争取更大丰收的切实措施，增强了争取更大丰收的信心。只有人们不仅认识了“八字宪法”对增产的重要性，同时也知道了应该怎样贯彻
  “八字宪法”的时候，才能更好地贯彻它。
      “八字宪法”是具体的措施，人们对它有了深刻的认识，是贯彻的重要保证。但是，仅仅做到了这一步还不行，还必须有物质保证。物质是具体的东西、实在的东西，一点马虎不得。今年，各地备耕工作都比往年抓得紧、抓得早，已经取得了很大成绩：肥料除越冬作物追肥外，春播作物一般已每亩积肥两万多斤；种子留的比往年充足；水利方面也有很大改善；为了提高劳动效率，各地积极进行了工具改革等等，这些都是我们今年能够更好地贯彻“八字宪法”的有利条件。但是能不能说我们各方面的物质准备工作都已做得很好了呢？能不能说每一个公社、管理区和生产队都已准备得很好呢？还不能这样说。以肥料为例，今年积肥比去年多得多，但并不是每一个公社的肥料都已十分充足了，仍有个别地方积肥并不多；尤其是很多地区的绝大部分肥料还没有运到田里，如果不采取有效措施赶快把肥料运到春播的田里去，能说肥料问题已经解决了吗？其他的物质准备方面，如种子的准备、春播工具的准备等等，也有类似情况。当前，各地应该按照“八字宪法”的要求，对春播的物质准备工作来一个紧急的全面的深入的检查，发现有不够不足的地方，就组织力量，突击解决，务必保证满足播种的需要。
    1959年农业的更大跃进，要求进一步提高春播的质量，标准是又好又快。好就是更好地贯彻“八字宪法”，按照“八字宪法”的要求进行播种；快就是不误农时，适时播种。根据过去的经验，适期播种和失期播种，在产量上悬殊很大。每一种作物适宜的播种期并不是很长的，如果抓得稍有不紧，很容易错过播种适期。因此，适期播种是一场紧张的战斗，一定要抢时间、抢季节，胜利过好适期播种这一关。所谓适期播种，并不是无限制地提前播种。有的地方不根据作物的种类和气候特点等条件，任意提早播种期是不好的。无论是全面贯彻“八字宪法”提高播种质量，无论是适期适时播种，除了事先作好一切必要的物质准备外，还需要采取有力的组织措施。我们认为有下面几个问题应该引起特别的重视：首先，各地人民公社应该按照党的八届六中全会决议中所提出的“统一领导、分级管理”的原则，进一步健全公社的管理制度，在公社统一领导下，应当使生产队在组织生产和基本建设、管理财务和管理生活福利事业等方面，有必要的权力，以便更好地发挥各个生产队的积极性。当前，各个人民公社应当首先把今年的生产计划、播种计划确定下来，并迅速地把计划落实到生产队和广大社员中去，以便生产队根据生产计划订出具体措施。其次，要合理的组织劳力。春耕期间，各地农村都要以春耕播种工作做为压倒一切的中心，把绝大部分劳动力从不急需的地方调到春耕播种战线上来，保证把决定大丰收的春播工作做好。第三，要进一步健全生产责任制。这是发挥广大社员生产积极性，使生产计划完满实现的重要保证。同时为了使生产责任制更好地发挥作用，为了使广大社员的劳动积极性进一步高涨，在建立责任制、加强党的政治思想工作的同时，应该认真贯彻“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则，使劳动得多和劳动得好的人得到更高的应得的报酬。
    春耕播种任务艰巨，时间紧迫，各地应该鼓起更大的革命干劲，按照“八字宪法”的要求，苦干实干巧干，适时地完成春季作物的播种任务，为1959年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进打下坚实的基础。
