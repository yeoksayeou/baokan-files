    Fertilizer - The Food of Crops
    Lu Feng
  Like other objects, plants are composed of chemical elements. There are a total of one hundred elements in nature, and as many as seventy have been found in plants. Some of these elements are essential for the growth and development of plants, while others are mixed into the plant body like "fools' gold" when the plant absorbs essential elements. Carbon is the most abundant element in plants, accounting for 45% of the total dry weight. Second is oxygen, accounting for 42%. Third is hydrogen, accounting for 6.5%. Fourth is nitrogen, accounting for 1.5%. Other ash elements such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium (named because they exist in the ash remaining after plant combustion) account for 5% in total. Plants need a relatively large amount of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, magnesium and other elements, so they are called macroelements. Plants need very small amounts of boron, copper, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt and other elements, so they are called microelements. Plants need extremely small amounts of uranium, radium, thorium, actinium and other elements, so they are called trace elements. Although the amount of these elements required by plants varies greatly, they are as important to the entire machine as large parts, small parts, and screws in a machine. They each have their own special functions, which are indispensable and irreplaceable for plants. This is the law of equal importance and irreplaceability that must be observed in plant nutrition.
    Among the various elements required by plants, except for carbon from carbon dioxide in the air, and oxygen and hydrogen from water, other elements come from the soil. These elements, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are needed in large quantities by plants, need to be satisfied by fertilization.
    First, let's talk about nitrogen. Nitrogen is an important substance that constitutes protein. Protein contains 16%-18% nitrogen. Engels said: "Life is the mode of existence of protein bodies" (Dialectics of Nature, p. 256). The main material constituting plant cell protoplasm is protein. The nucleus has special significance in the life and division of cells, and the nucleic acid of the nucleus contains nitrogen. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that there is no life without nitrogen. Not only that, nitrogen is also the building material of plant chlorophyll, and one molecule of chlorophyll contains four nitrogen atoms. Chlorophyll is the factory for plants to manufacture organic matter. Without it, organic matter cannot be formed. Therefore, with sufficient nitrogen, plants have luxuriant branches and leaves, green leaves, strong photosynthesis, and produce more organic matter, resulting in high yields. Conversely, the leaves will turn yellow, the plants will be short, the photosynthesis will be reduced, and the organic matter produced will be less, and the yield will inevitably be low. However, too much nitrogen or improper application can also cause plants to grow wildly and tissues to be too tender, which can easily cause plants to lodge, be attacked by diseases and insects, and delay maturity.
    Next, let's talk about phosphorus. Phosphorus is an important substance that constitutes nucleoprotein and phospholipids, and plays an important role in the metabolism of organic matter such as starch and protein. Plant seeds are particularly rich in phospholipids, and phosphorus is important for the maturation of seeds. When phosphorus is insufficient, plants emerge leaves late, showing red, purple or bronze color, sometimes forming brown spots, poor development, less tillering or even no tillering, late flowering, poor seed maturation, reduced germination ability, and so on.
    Potassium also plays a significant role in plants. It is closely related to the formation, conversion, and storage of carbohydrates. Potassium deficiency reduces photosynthesis. Potassium can also promote the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by plants, making crops grow strongly, with tough stems and leaves, and enhance the ability to resist lodging and resist diseases and insect pests. Therefore, under highly dense planting conditions, special attention should be paid to the application of potash fertilizer.
    Although the content of sulfur in protein is less than that of nitrogen, it is also an indispensable component for the constitution of protein. Magnesium is also an element that constitutes chlorophyll, and it exists in the protoplasm of young cells and plays an important role in the material metabolism of cells. Although iron is not an element that constitutes chlorophyll, it plays an important role in the formation of chlorophyll. Without it, chlorophyll cannot be formed either. Calcium has a great promoting effect on the metabolism of sugars and nitrogen-containing substances. Calcium can also form insoluble salts with certain organic acids in plants (which are products of cell metabolism), thus eliminating the toxic effects of these organic acids on plants.
    The role of trace elements in plants is like that of vitamins for animals and humans. Although the amount needed is very small, the lack of them will hinder normal growth and development and cause plants to produce some adverse symptoms. For example, boron has a profound impact on the function of the plant transport system (the trunk line for plants to transport water, nutrients, and organic matter), the fertilization and fruit setting of flowers, and the development of roots. Other trace elements such as copper, zinc, manganese, molybdenum, and cobalt are also indispensable for the normal development of plants.
    Various elements have different physiological functions for plants, but they are not independent of each other. According to research by plant physiologists, if the ions of a certain chemical element accumulate excessively in the plant (relative to the ions of other elements), "ion toxicity" will occur. If the proportion of other ions is relatively increased, this phenomenon will be eliminated due to the "antagonistic effect between ions." In addition, the utilization rate of nitrogen by plants is significantly improved when a sufficient amount of potassium is present. Therefore, the physiological functions of various elements on plants are mutually different and interconnected. This is the reason why various fertilizers should be used in combination.
    Reasonable fertilization can meet the needs of crops for various nutrient elements. Calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, and other elements that are needed in large quantities are contained in general soils in sufficient quantities to ensure the needs of crops, and are also contained in general farmyard manure. Therefore, they are not often mentioned in fertilization. Crops need a relatively large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and the content in the soil alone cannot guarantee the needs of crops, so they occupy an important position in fertilization, and people often call them the three essential elements of fertilizer. In terms of the content of trace elements in the soil, it is sufficient for the needs of crops; however, they are often in an insoluble state and cannot be utilized by crops, so they are often felt to be insufficient. Attention must also be paid to them during fertilization.
    There are many kinds of fertilizers and a wide range of sources. Various organic fertilizers in rural areas, such as human and animal manure, various livestock manure, compost, and green manure, are large in quantity and are the main force in fertilizers. Farmyard manure contains relatively complete nutrient elements, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This kind of fertilizer can also promote the activity of soil microorganisms and be transformed into humus by certain bacteria, promote the formation of aggregate structure, enhance the soil's ability to retain water and fertilizer, improve soil temperature and ventilation, and improve soil fertility. Combining deep plowing, applying a large amount of organic fertilizer, and dissolving fertilizer and soil together is an effective method to accelerate the activation of raw soil. This is the great creation of Chinese farmers in the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture in 1958. Therefore, fertilization should be based on organic fertilizers.
    Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and rhizobia of leguminous crops can utilize nitrogen in the air to increase the nitrogen content of the soil; phosphorus bacteria can convert ineffective phosphorus in the soil into effective phosphorus. Cultivating these bacteria to make bacterial agents for use as fertilizers is bacterial fertilizer.
    Some fertilizers, such as superphosphate and trace elements, are easily chemically fixed by other substances in the soil after being directly applied to the soil, and become insoluble, cannot be absorbed by plants, and greatly reduce fertilizer efficiency. Therefore, superphosphate is often mixed with organic fertilizer to make granular fertilizer. Some people smelt trace elements such as boron, copper, zinc, and manganese in glass to make glass fertilizer. Both granular fertilizer and glass fertilizer reduce the contact surface with the soil, reduce chemical fixation, and prolong the fertilizer supply time.

    肥料——作物的粮食
    鲁峰
  同其他物体一样，植物体也是由化学元素构成的。自然界共有一百种元素，在植物体中已发现的就有七十种之多。其中有些元素是植物的生长发育所必需的，有些则是在植物吸收必需元素时“鱼目混珠”般混进植物体的。植物体中含量最多的是碳，占全部干物重的45％。其次是氧，占42％。第三是氢，占6.5％。第四是氮，占1.5％。其他磷、钾、钙、镁等灰分元素（因存在于植物体燃烧后剩余的灰中而得名）共占5％。植物对碳、氢、氧、氮、磷、硫、钾、钙、镁等元素需量较多，所以称为大量元素。对硼、铜、锌、锰、钼、钴等元素需量很少，所以称为微量元素。对铀、镭、钍、锕等元素需量极少，所以称为超微量元素。植物对这些元素的需要量虽然差别很大，但它们像机器中的大机件、小零件和螺丝钉一样，对整个机器来说都是重要的。它们各有各的特殊功能，为植物所不可缺少，而且不可代替。这就是植物营养中必须遵守的同等重要和不可代替律。
    植物所需的各种元素中，除了碳来自空气中的二氧化碳，以及氧和氢来自水分以外，其他元素都来自土壤。这些元素，特别是植物需量较多的氮、磷、钾都需要用施肥的办法来满足。
    先说氮。氮是构成蛋白质的重要物质，蛋白质中含有16％—18％的氮。恩格斯说过：“生命是蛋白体的存在方式”（自然辩证法256页）。构成植物细胞原生质的主要材料就是蛋白质。细胞核在细胞的生活和分裂中具有特殊的意义，而细胞核的核酸中就含有氮。所以，可以毫不夸大地说：没有氮就没有生命。不仅如此，氮还是植物叶绿素的建造材料，一分子的叶绿素中就含有四个氮原子。而叶绿素是植物制造有机物的工厂，没有它，有机物便不能形成。所以，氮素充足，植物就枝叶茂盛，叶色葱绿，光合作用强，制造的有机物多，结果产量也是高的。反之，就叶色发黄，植株矮小，光合作用降低，制造的有机物少，结果产量也必然是低的。但是氮素过多或是施用不当，也会引起植物的疯长和组织过于幼嫩，易使植物发生倒伏、遭受病虫侵害和延迟成熟。
    再说磷。磷是构成核蛋白和磷脂的重要物质，在淀粉和蛋白质等有机物的代谢中起重要的作用。植物的籽实中特别富有磷脂，磷对种子的成熟有重要作用。磷不足时，植物出叶迟，呈现红色、紫色或青铜色，有时形成褐色的斑点，发育不良，分蘖少甚至不分蘖，开花迟，籽实成熟不好，发芽力减低等等。
    钾在植物体中的作用也不小，它对碳水化合物的形成、转化和贮藏有密切的关系。钾缺乏时光合作用降低。钾还可以促进植物对氮素的吸收和利用，使作物生长健壮、茎叶坚韧，增强抗倒伏及抗病虫害的能力。所以在高度密植的情况下，要特别注意钾肥的施用。
    硫在蛋白质中的含量虽较氮少，但也是构成蛋白质所不可缺少的成分。镁也是构成叶绿色的元素，而且它存在于幼嫩细胞的原生质中，在细胞的物质代谢里有重要作用。铁虽不是构成叶绿色的元素，但在叶绿素的形成过程中有重要作用，缺少了它，叶绿素同样不能形成。钙对醣类和含氮物质的代谢有很大的促进作用。钙还可以和植物体内某些有机酸（它是细胞代谢的产物），形成不溶性的盐类，免除了这些有机酸对植物的毒害。
    微量元素对于植物的作用，好像维生素对于动物和人类一样，需要量虽然很少，但缺了它们也会阻碍正常地生长和发育，使植物产生一些不良的症状。例如硼，它对植物输导系统（植物运输水分、养分及有机物的干线）的功能、花的受精和结实，以及根的发育，都有深刻的影响。其他铜、锌、锰、钼、钴等微量元素，也都是植物的正常发育所不可少的。
    各种元素对植物有不同的生理功能，但并不是互不相干的。据植物生理学家的研究，若某种化学元素的离子在植物体中过多的积累（同其他元素的离子相对而言），就会发生“离子的毒害作用”。如果相对地增加其他离子的比例，就会因为“离子间的拮抗作用”而消除这种现象。另外，在有足够量的钾存在时，植物对氮素的利用率显著提高。所以说，各种元素对植物的生理功能是相互区别而又相互联系的。这就是为什么要各种肥料配合使用的原因。
    合理施肥可以满足作物对各种营养元素的需要。钙、镁、硫、铁及其他需要量较多的元素，在一般的土壤里所含有的都足够保证作物的需要，而且一般农家肥料中也含有。所以在施肥方面不大提到它们。氮、磷、钾三元素作物需量较多，仅靠土壤中的含量不能保证作物的需要，所以在施肥中它们占有重要的地位，人们常称它们为肥料三要素。微量元素按其在土壤中的含量来说，那是足够作物需要的；但它们常处在不溶解的状态下，不能为作物利用，所以也常感不足。在施肥时也不能不注意到。
    肥料的种类非常多，来源非常广泛。农村中的各种有机肥料，如人粪尿、各种家畜圈粪、堆肥以及绿肥等，数量很大，是肥料中的主力军。农家肥料含的营养元素较为完全，氮磷钾都有。这种肥料还能促进土壤微生物的活动，并被某些细菌改造成为腐植质，促使团粒结构的形成，增强土壤保水保肥的能力，改善土壤温度和通气状况，提高土壤肥力。结合深耕，大量施用有机肥料，并使肥土相溶，是加速生土活化的有效方法。这是我国农民在1958年农业大跃进中的伟大创造。所以，施肥应以有机肥料为主。
    固氮菌和豆科作物的根瘤菌，可以利用空气中的氮素，提高土壤的含氮量；磷细菌可以使土壤中无效磷转变为有效磷。培养这些细菌制成菌剂作为肥料使用，就是细菌肥料。
    有些肥料，如过磷酸钙和微量元素，直接施入土壤以后，容易同土壤中其他物质起化学的固定作用，而成为不溶解的状态，不能被植物吸收，大大降低了肥效。所以常把过磷酸钙和有机肥料混合制成颗粒肥料。有人把硼、铜、锌、锰等微量元素熔炼在玻璃里，制成玻璃肥料。颗粒肥料和玻璃肥料都减少了和土壤的接触面，降低了化学固定作用，延长了供肥时间。
