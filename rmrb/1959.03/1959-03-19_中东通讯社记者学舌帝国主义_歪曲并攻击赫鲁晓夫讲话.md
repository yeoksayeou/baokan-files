Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 18th: A political reporter for the Middle East News Agency published a commentary on the evening of the 17th regarding Khrushchev's speech at the reception for the Iraqi government delegation. This commentary viciously distorted and attacked Khrushchev's speech.

The commentary slandered Khrushchev's speech as being "opposed to Arab nationalism" and preposterously claimed: "This is clear evidence" that the Arab Communist Parties are "accepting instructions from Moscow" and "shows that the Communist Parties are agents of Moscow."

This reporter also echoed imperialist rhetoric, saying that Soviet support for Arab Communists was "paving the way for the entire Arab regime to succumb to communism" and "is open interference, forcibly supporting a Communist regime subordinate to Moscow." This news agency sought excuses to oppose the Soviet Union, insisting that "the Soviet Union changed its position after the Iraqi revolution," slandering Khrushchev for "now openly supporting the Communist Party, attacking Arab nationalism and Arab unity." It said: "Due to Moscow's new stance, Arab nationalism and Communist imperialism have launched an open struggle."

The commentary also said: "President Nasser has not changed his position. He has consistently opposed communism. He believes it is subordinate to foreign powers and inconsistent with neutralism and non-alignment." It also said that the UAR "opposes subordination and all forms of imperialism."

All Cairo newspapers, Cairo Radio, and the Voice of the Arabs radio station today started their propaganda machines to attack Khrushchev's speech. The Voice of the Arabs radio station also broadcast this to all Asian and African countries in nineteen languages.

    中东通讯社记者学舌帝国主义
    歪曲并攻击赫鲁晓夫讲话
    新华社18日讯　大马士革消息：中东通讯社政治记者17日晚上就赫鲁晓夫在招待伊拉克政府代表团会上的讲话发表了一篇评论。这篇评论恶毒地歪曲并攻击赫鲁晓夫的讲话。
    这篇评论诬蔑赫鲁晓夫的讲话是“反对阿拉伯民族主义”，并且信口雌黄地说：“这是一种明确的证据说明”，阿拉伯共产党是“接受莫斯科的指示的”，“表明共产党是莫斯科的代理人”。
    这个记者也学着帝国主义的腔调说，苏联支持阿拉伯共产党人是“为整个阿拉伯的政权屈从共产主义铺平道路”，“就是进行公开干涉，强行扶植从属于莫斯科的共产党政权”。这家通讯社为反对苏联寻找借口，硬说“苏联在伊拉克革命后改变了立场”，诬蔑赫鲁晓夫“现在公开支持共产党，攻击阿拉伯民族主义和阿拉伯统一”。它说：“由于莫斯科采取了新的立场，阿拉伯民族主义和共产帝国主义就展开了公开的斗争”。
    这篇评论还说：“纳赛尔总统并没有改变他的立场。他一贯反对共产主义。他认为它是从属外国的，同中立主义和不结盟政策是不一致的。”它还说，阿联“反对从属地位和一切形式的帝国主义”。
    所有的开罗报纸、开罗电台和阿拉伯之声电台今天都开动宣传机器攻击赫鲁晓夫的讲话。阿拉伯之声电台还用十九种语言对所有亚非国家进行了这种广播。
