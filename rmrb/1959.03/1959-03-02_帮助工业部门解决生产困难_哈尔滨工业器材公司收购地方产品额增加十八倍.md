    Helping Industrial Sectors Solve Production Difficulties
    Harbin Industrial Equipment Company Increases Purchase of Local Products by Eighteen Times
    (By our report) The Party organization of Harbin Industrial Equipment Company, based on mobilizing employees to summarize the leaping-forward experiences of 1958, launched a red flag competition movement centered on supporting industrial and agricultural production by discussing the situation, talking about tasks, examining ideology, and boosting morale. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the employees and the combination of hard work and ingenuity, the company helped industrial sectors solve the shortage of 5,550 tons of steel raw materials, 120 sets of various machinery and equipment, and more than 12,000 tools within one month. This helped many factories break through the difficulties of raw materials, equipment, and tools to varying degrees. The company also expanded its source of goods, with the purchase of local products in January increasing eighteen times compared to the same period last year. This laid an extremely favorable foundation for the work of the whole year.
    From the beginning of the year, after analyzing the needs of this year's production materials and the situation of goods sources, the company's Party committee, in order to adapt to the new situation of a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, targeted the ideological obstacles existing in some employees and cadres at that time. They adopted forms such as holding industrial and commercial coordination meetings, store cadre meetings, employee meetings, group meetings, and individual visits. Through repeated debates of presenting facts and reasoning, debating and practicing, they criticized ideas such as the "potential has reached its limit" belief that local industrial products and raw materials were exhausted last year, and there would be no more oil to extract, the "mechanical balance theory" of fearing too much and fearing too little, and the right-leaning conservative thoughts and fear of difficulty such as "movements cannot bring goods." This made the employees clear that only by starting from production, cultivating sources of goods, and regarding the difficulties of industry as their own, can commercial departments strive for more sources of goods.
    In order to ensure the completion of the task, the company, on the basis of the original 150 purchasing personnel, transferred troops and dispatched generals, drawing 400 purchasing troops composed of Party, Youth League, and trade union cadres and various types of personnel, to go to various factories and counties, ensuring that each factory had a dedicated person and each county had a resident staff. They also adopted a method of meeting once a day, checking every three days, exchanging experiences every five days, and evaluating every ten days, so that the movement developed violently forward with one wave pushing higher than the previous one.
    The employees of the company set themselves arduous tasks as their goals: to make products that the locality does not have available, to increase the production of those with low output, to improve the quality of those with poor quality, and to reduce the prices of those that are expensive. Therefore, they tried every means to help factories solve production difficulties. For example, when the Industrial University Lightning Arrester Factory had production difficulties due to a lack of steel wire, the Electrical Shop organized six people to find 700 kilograms from four units, solving the production difficulty. When some factories urgently needed raw materials due to the national allocation of raw materials not arriving, they adopted the method of contracting processing for the factory to solve the urgent need for raw materials. For example, Harbin Nail Factory and Taiji Factory used this method to solve the problem. Because some factories urgently needed some equipment and tools, the company actively organized manpower to run around to help solve the problem.
    The employees of Harbin Industrial Equipment Company fully utilized the characteristics of commercial departments of "wide vision, long legs, and broad contact" in their work, actively acting as "matchmakers" to tap the material potential of all aspects. Through various forms of coordination meetings, they organized material adjustment between factories, solving the problem of surplus in some and shortage in others.

    帮助工业部门解决生产困难
    哈尔滨工业器材公司收购地方产品额增加十八倍
    本报讯　哈尔滨工业器材公司的党组织在发动职工总结1958年跃进经验的基础上，通过论形势、谈任务、查思想、鼓干劲，掀起了以支援工农业生产为中心的大购大销红旗竞赛运动，由于职工干劲冲天，苦干和巧干结合，在一个月的时间内，帮助工业部门解决了钢铁原料五千五百五十吨，各种机器设备一百二十台、工具一万二千多件。使许多工厂在不同程度上突破了原料、设备、工具的难关。这个公司也扩大了商品货源，1月份的收购地方产品额比去年同期增加十八倍。为全年工作打下了极为有利的基础。
    从年初开始，该公司党委在研究分析了今年生产资料商品需要和货源情况之后，为了适应工农业生产更大跃进的新形势，针对当时在某些职工和干部中存在的思想障碍，采取召开工商协作会、商店干部会、职工大会、小组会、个别访问等形式，通过摆事实、讲道理的反复辩论，边辩论边实践，批判了那种认为：去年地方工业产品和原材料挖光了，再挖也没有多大油水的“潜力到顶论”；多了也怕，少了也怕的“机械平衡论”和“搞运动也运动不来货”等右倾保守思想和畏难情绪，使职工们明确了商业部门只有从生产出发，培植货源基地，把工业的困难，看做本身的困难，才能够争取更多的商品货源。
    为了保证任务的完成，该公司在原来一百五十名采购人员的基础上，调兵遣将，抽调了有党团、工会干部以及各类人员参加的四百名采购大军，分赴各厂各县，做到厂厂有专人，县县有驻在员，并且采取了每日一碰头、三日一检查、五日一交流经验、十日一评比的方法，使运动后浪推前浪、一浪高一浪地猛烈地向前发展。
    这个公司的职工们给自己规定了很艰巨的任务，作为奋斗目标：地方没有的产品让它有，产量少的使它多，质量次的叫它好，价格贵的让它贱。因此，他们千方百计地帮助工厂解决生产中的困难，如：工业大学避雷器厂因缺少钢丝，生产发生困难的时候，电工商店就组织了六名人员，从四个单位找到七百公斤，解决了生产的困难。某些工厂由于国家调拨原料未到，生产急需原材料的时候，他们就采取为工厂承揽加工的办法，解决了原料上的急需。如：哈尔滨制钉厂、太记工厂等都是采取这种办法解决的。有些工厂因为急需部分设备、工具，该公司就积极组织人力东奔西跑帮助解决。
    哈尔滨工业器材公司职工在工作中充分运用了商业部门“眼宽、腿长、联系面广”的特点，积极主动地当好“红娘”，发掘各方面的物资潜力，通过各种形式的协作会，组织工厂与工厂之间的物资调剂，解决了此多彼少的问题。
