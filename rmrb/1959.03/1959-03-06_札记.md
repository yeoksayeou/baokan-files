    Notes
    A Spirit of National Betrayal
    Syngman Rhee is again clamoring to "abolish the 38th parallel." However, this time he chose the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the March 1st Korean national anti-Japanese uprising movement to make his outcry, which is a great irony for a traitor.
    Syngman Rhee shamelessly says, "We will once again be asked to display the March 1st spirit." But for the Korean people, the "March 1st spirit" is an anti-imperialist spirit, a spirit of striving for national independence; while the Syngman Rhee clique, under the sacred banner of the "March 1st spirit," is not satisfied with having sold out most of Korea's territory and is still attempting to "abolish the 38th parallel" and sell out the entire Korean nation's independence and sovereignty to American imperialism. What Syngman Rhee wants to "display" is nothing less than a spirit of national betrayal.
    Anemic and Timid
    The London Agreement selling out Cyprus caused a "stormy and fierce debate" (Associated Press) in the Greek parliament. The ruling party staged an all-out brawl to barely pass the agreement with 170 votes against 118.
    When opposition members criticized the London Agreement and insisted that Cyprus should gain true independence, Greek Foreign Minister Averoff angrily called them "anemic and timid."
    However, hasn't the Greek government insisted for several years on Cyprus gaining independence and self-determination? How does Mr. Averoff explain this himself? The Greek government yielded to the enormous pressure from the United States and Britain, betraying its own position, which is truly anemic and timid.
    Imperialism can still conquer some spineless and cowardly people, but it cannot conquer a just struggle. The "storm" in the Greek parliament also reflects this fact.

    札记
    卖国精神
    李承晚又在叫嚷“废除三八线”了。可是，他这回选择了3月1日朝鲜民族反日起义运动四十周年的时机进行叫嚣，这对卖国者是莫大的讽刺。
    李承晚厚颜无耻地说，“我们将再一次被要求来显示3月1日精神”。但对朝鲜人民来说，“3月1日精神”是反帝的精神，争取民族独立的精神；而李承晚集团却是要打着“3月1日精神”这样神圣的招牌，不以出卖了大半个朝鲜河山为满足，还要妄图“废除三八线”，把整个朝鲜民族的独立主权出卖给美帝国主义。李承晚所要“显示”的，是不折不扣的卖国精神。
    贫血的和胆小的
    出卖塞浦路斯的伦敦协定，在希腊议会引起了“暴风雨般的激烈辩论”（美联社）。执政党演出了全武行，才勉强使这个协定以一百七十票对一百一十八票获得通过。
    当反对党议员指责伦敦协定，坚持要使塞浦路斯得到真正独立的时候，希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫大骂他们是“贫血的和胆小的”。
    然而，希腊政府不是曾经有好几年坚持过要使塞浦路斯获得独立和自决吗？阿维罗夫先生对此何以自解。希腊政府在美国和英国的巨大压力下屈服、背叛自己的立场，这才真正是贫血的和胆小的。
    帝国主义还能征服一些软骨虫和胆小鬼，但不能征服正义斗争。希腊议会的“暴风雨”也反映了这一事实。
