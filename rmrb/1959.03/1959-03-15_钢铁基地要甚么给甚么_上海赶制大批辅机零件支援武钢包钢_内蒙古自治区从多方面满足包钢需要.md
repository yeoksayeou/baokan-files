　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th. Shanghai is rushing to produce a large number of auxiliary machines and parts to support Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel.
　　On the 11th, the Shanghai Railway Bureau broke with convention and transported a 55-kilowatt vertical motor directly from Shanghai to Baotou without transshipment, in order to support the urgent needs of Baotou Steel construction. This special specification motor was specially produced by Shanghai Motor Factory by transferring workers to rush production for Baotou Steel. At present, many large and small factories in Shanghai, like the Shanghai Motor Factory, are concentrating their efforts to rush to produce a large number of auxiliary machines and parts for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel. Almost every day, batches of industrial equipment are shipped from Shanghai to the two major steel bases.
　　Since the beginning of this year, many factories in Shanghai have undertaken the task of manufacturing tens of thousands of auxiliary machines and parts for Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel. These include not only medium and small-sized steel products, mining crushing machinery, precision instruments, switching equipment, motors, transformers, and electric welding machines that are produced in large quantities in Shanghai, but also many kinds of scattered materials and machine parts with very special specifications. The characteristics of this batch of tasks are small batches, many varieties, and tight deadlines. In order to meet the urgent needs of the two major steel bases, the Shanghai Iron and Steel, Machinery, and Electrical Industries departments resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard", and list the auxiliary machines and parts they need as the primary task of each factory to ensure that they are completed with quality, quantity, and on time. As soon as Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Industry Company and Steel Processing Company receive an order from Wuhan Steel, they immediately arrange for their affiliated factories to produce it. As long as Baotou Steel needs wires and cables, Shanghai Cable Factory always gives priority to transferring them.
　　The workers in many factories are doing everything possible to overcome the difficulties of raw materials to ensure the timely completion of production tasks. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, which undertakes the manufacture of mining and washing equipment, installed a hot blast stove by themselves, used indigenous iron to produce seven crushers and other equipment, and supplied them to Wuhan Steel in a timely manner. When Shanghai Welding Rod Factory learned that Wuhan Steel urgently needed welding rods, it took the initiative to use the titanium dioxide originally intended for the production of other products in the factory to produce welding rods for Wuhan Steel first. Encouraged by the slogan "Everything is for the early tapping of iron from Wuhan Steel's No. 2 blast furnace," the workers adopted the measure of "people don't stop, machines don't stop," increasing production from one shift to three shifts, and completing the manufacture of 120 tons of welding rods ahead of schedule, and transporting the products to Wuhan Steel in batches in a timely manner.
　　The relevant industrial departments in Shanghai also adopted the method of having large and small factories work together to ensure the completion of the processing and manufacturing tasks of many semi-finished products and parts. Recently, Baotou Steel urgently needed a batch of motors. Because the motor factory undertaking this manufacturing task lacked punching dies, it was unable to punch silicon steel sheets. After learning about this situation, Huasheng Motor Factory and May 1st Motor Factory took the initiative to arrange the production in their factories and gave priority to processing the silicon steel sheets needed by Baotou Steel.
　　The transportation departments in Shanghai give special care to the equipment transported to Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel, ensuring that there are ships when needed and vehicles when needed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 14th. The relevant departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are vigorously supporting the construction of Baotou Steel in many ways. A number of factories that meet the needs of Baotou Steel's construction, production, and employee life are being planned. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Support Baotou Steel Construction Committee recently organized relevant units to form a working group to go deep into the Baotou Steel construction site to specifically understand the quantity and specifications of the products that Baotou Steel needs to support, and decided that all tasks that the autonomous region can manufacture and undertake must be arranged with priority and guaranteed supply.
　　The relevant departments of the autonomous region have made proper arrangements for the projects in which Baotou Steel requires the autonomous region to support and cooperate in terms of coal, electricity, transportation, and urban construction. For example, the Baotou Coal Washing Plant, which is under construction, is worried that it will not be able to catch up with the needs when the No. 1 blast furnace is put into production due to the late completion time. Therefore, the autonomous region decided to build a batch of simple coal washing plants, which are now being rushed to build.
　　The commercial departments of the autonomous region have also made proper arrangements for the labor protection products, small tools, daily necessities, etc. needed by Baotou Steel workers.

    钢铁基地要甚么给甚么
    上海赶制大批辅机零件支援武钢包钢  内蒙古自治区从多方面满足包钢需要
    新华社上海14日电　上海赶制大批辅机和零件支援武钢、包钢。
    11日，上海铁路局打破常规，将一台五十五瓩的立式电动机不经中途转运，从上海直接运往包头，支援包钢建设的急迫需要。这台规格特殊的电动机，是上海电机厂专门抽调工人为包钢突击生产的。目前，上海许多大小工厂都像上海电机厂一样，正在集中力量为包钢、武钢赶制大批辅机和零件。几乎每天都有成批的工业器材，由上海运往两大钢铁基地。
    今年以来，上海许多工厂担负了武钢、包钢几万台（件）辅机和零件的制造任务。其中不仅有上海大批生产的中小型钢材、矿山破碎机械、精密仪表、开关设备、电动机、变压器、电焊机，也有许多品种规格非常特殊的零星材料机件。批量小、品种多、时间紧，是这批任务的特点。为了满足两大钢铁基地的急需，上海钢铁、机械、电机工业部门，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，把他们需用的辅机和部件，列为各厂的首要任务，保证按质、按量、按时完成。上海市有色金属工业公司、钢铁加工公司一接到武钢的定货，就立刻布置给所属工厂生产。只要是包钢需用的电线电缆，上海电缆厂总是优先调运。
    许多工厂的职工千方百计克服原材料的困难，保证生产任务的按期完成。承制采矿洗选设备的上海矿山机器厂，工人们自己动手安装热风炉，利用土铁生产了七台破碎机等设备，及时供应武钢的需要。当上海电焊棒制造厂知道武钢迫切需要电焊条的时候，就主动地把厂里原来准备生产别种产品用的钛白粉先用来为武钢生产电焊条。职工们在“一切为了使武钢二号高炉提前出铁”的口号的鼓舞下，采取人停机器不停的措施，由原来一班生产增加到三班生产，提前完成了一百二十吨电焊条的制造任务，及时地把产品分批运往武钢。
    上海有关工业部门还采取大小工厂一齐干的办法，来保证完成许多半制品和零件的加工制造任务。最近包钢急需一批电动机，担任这项制造任务的一家电机厂，由于缺少冲模，无法冲制矽钢片。华生电机厂和五一电机厂了解到这种情况后，就主动地安排厂里的生产，优先加工包钢需要的矽钢片。
    上海的交通运输部门对于运往武钢、包钢的器材，都给予特殊的照顾，做到要船有船，要车有车。
    新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区各有关部门从多方面大力支援包钢建设。一批适应包钢建设、生产和职工生活需要的工厂，正在筹建中。内蒙古自治区支援包钢建设委员会，最近还组织有关单位联合组成工作组深入包钢工地，具体了解包钢建设需要支援的产品数量、规格，决定凡自治区能制造和承担的任务，都要优先作好安排，并且保证供应。
    包钢在煤炭、电力、交通、城市建设等方面要求自治区支援和协作的项目，自治区有关部门都作了妥善安排。例如正在建设的包头洗煤厂，因为建成的时间较晚，怕赶不上一号高炉投入生产时的需要，因此自治区决定修建一批简易洗煤厂，目前正在突击修建。
    包钢职工需要的劳保用品、小工具、日用百货等，自治区的商业部门也作了妥善安排。
