Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 19th. After a twenty-four-day visit to India, the Soviet government delegation left here today for home.

Those who went to the airport to see them off included Indian Minister of Steel, Mines and Fuel, Singh, Minister of State in the Ministry of Steel, Mines and Fuel, Malaviya, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Lakshmi Menon, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to India.

At a press conference held here this morning, the head of the delegation, Andreyev, sternly condemned the United States for recently concluding bilateral military agreements with Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.

Andreyev said, "The peace-loving people of Asia rightly believe that these military agreements are a new and serious threat to the cause of peace in this region." He said that we understand the Indian people's concern about the U.S.-Pakistan military agreement, "because despite the guarantees given by the U.S. government, the spearhead of this agreement is directed not only against the Soviet Union, but first and foremost against Pakistan's neighbors - India and Afghanistan. Prominent Pakistani politicians have openly declared the anti-Indian nature of this agreement." Mukhinov, a member of the Soviet government delegation, answered questions at the press conference.

When a reporter asked whether it was possible to increase Soviet economic assistance to India, he replied: "When we talked with the leaders of this country, we agreed that it is practically possible to further develop our economic cooperation in all aspects. We have reached agreements on the construction of a heavy machinery manufacturing plant, an optical glass manufacturing plant, an oil refinery, and assistance in establishing tea factories and other industrial sectors."

    苏政府代表团结束在印度访问
    双方一致认为进一步发展经济合作有实际可能  安德烈耶夫严厉谴责美国威胁亚洲的和平事业
    新华社新德里19日电　苏联政府代表团在印度进行了历时二十四天的访问以后，今天离开这里回国。
    前往机场欢送的有印度钢铁、矿业和燃料部部长辛格、这个部的在部国务部长马拉维亚、外交部副部长拉克希米·梅农夫人等以及各国驻印度外交使节。
    代表团团长安德烈耶夫今天上午在这里举行的记者招待会上严厉谴责美国最近同巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其缔结双边军事协定。
    安德烈耶夫说，“亚洲爱好和平的人民正确地认为这些军事协定是对这个地区的和平事业的新的严重的威胁”。他说，我们了解印度人民对美巴军事协定的忧虑，“因为尽管美国政府提出保证，这个协定的矛头不仅是针对苏联的，而且首先是针对巴基斯坦的邻国——印度和阿富汗的。巴基斯坦的主要政治家公开宣布了这个协定的反印度的性质。”苏联政府代表团团员穆希金诺夫在记者招待会上回答了问题。
    有记者问到是否可能增加苏联对印度的经济援助。他回答说：“当我们同这个国家的领导人会谈时，我们一致认为，在各方面进一步发展我们的经济合作是有实际可能的。我们已就修建重型机器制造厂、光学玻璃制造厂、炼油厂以及帮助建立制茶厂和其他工业部门等问题达成了协议”。
