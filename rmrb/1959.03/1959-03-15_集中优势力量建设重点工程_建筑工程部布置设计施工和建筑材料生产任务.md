Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: Over six hundred representatives from construction departments, enterprises, scientific research institutions, and schools across the country concluded the enlarged meeting of the Ministry of Construction's bureaus yesterday with challenges and responses. They aim to launch a technical revolution within the national construction system and initiate a mass movement centered on improving labor productivity, propelling surveying and design, construction and installation, building materials production, and urban construction to a new high tide.

The meeting lasted fifteen days. It summarized the work of 1958, deployed the tasks for 1959, and discussed issues related to political work, urban construction, scientific research, and education in the construction sector.

In 1958, China's construction industry achieved tremendous accomplishments. The design workload completed that year increased more than fourfold compared to 1957, exceeding the total design workload completed during the First Five-Year Plan. This fundamentally reversed the past situation where design lagged behind construction. Due to the implementation of rapid construction methods, the construction period was generally accelerated by more than double. Engineering costs were significantly reduced, with construction units saving the state 540 million yuan last year. The vast majority of projects were of excellent quality. Building materials production increased significantly last year. Preliminary planning for one hundred and forty-three large and medium-sized cities was also completed last year, and municipal engineering construction was carried out in more than three hundred cities.

The meeting pointed out that this year's construction tasks are even greater than last year, with tight schedules, complex engineering structures, and high technical requirements. Many heavy machinery factories, large thermal power plants, and other important projects are scheduled to commence construction this year, with more than half of the projects to be completed and put into production this year. This requires construction workers to continue to exert their utmost efforts, further implement the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results," overcome difficulties in building materials, construction machinery, and technical expertise, and strive for an all-round great leap forward in surveying and design, construction and installation, and building materials production.

This year, design work must vigorously improve design quality and technology while maintaining the rapid development speed of last year. Industrial design must conscientiously implement the principles of "being solid and applicable, economical and reasonable, and technologically advanced." Although design departments in various provinces and cities have undertaken a considerable amount of industrial design, there is an urgent need to improve their technology, pass the "industrial design hurdle," and simultaneously handle the increased workload of civil building design, carrying dual responsibilities. Civil building design must comprehensively implement the principles of "economy, practicality, and, where possible, attention to aesthetics." Design work should continue to implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with different requirements for different project designs. The design of large and medium-sized industrial buildings should primarily use foreign methods, appropriately absorbing the successful experiences of indigenous production methods; the design of small-scale industries, without reducing quality, can adopt more indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods.

This year, in terms of construction and installation, rapid construction methods should be promoted on a large scale, making it a regular construction practice, while ensuring quality. The speed of rapid construction should be appropriate, varying according to different construction units and different engineering targets. Construction management should include not only deadlines but also quality, labor productivity, and cost targets. Attention should be paid to improving the labor organization and working methods of construction teams, strengthening preparatory work for rapid construction, and seizing the final stages of projects to strive for early completion and commissioning.

The meeting emphasized that the construction industry should pay particular attention to ensuring engineering quality and construction safety this year. All construction departments should implement effective safety systems and technical inspection systems, material component inspection systems, and properly carry out the acceptance of concealed works and completed projects. In particular, foundations, reinforced concrete, welding, hoisting, and other projects should be strictly inspected in a timely manner to ensure quality.

Regarding the sequencing of construction projects, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to implement the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard," distinguishing between priorities and urgency, and first ensuring the construction of key projects, especially those with production tasks this year, which should be started and completed as early as possible. In terms of building materials, machinery, and manpower, it was emphasized that they should be unified and concentrated for use. All construction units should proceed from the overall situation, strengthen collaboration, and ensure the construction of key projects. It is necessary to continue to mobilize the masses to carry out technical revolutions, from the reform of low-level tools to semi-mechanization and mechanization, first comprehensively promoting the effective and finalized improved tools and new technologies. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." The investment contracting method should be promoted step by step according to the specific situation to fully mobilize the initiative of construction enterprises.

This year, the state has a great need for building materials. The meeting proposed that building materials production should resolutely implement the policy of "walking on two legs," on the one hand vigorously tapping the production potential of existing enterprises, launching a high-quality, high-yield movement, and on the other hand grasping capital construction, strengthening the exploration of mineral resources, and expanding the scale of capital construction so that the new and expanded projects of cement, glass, ceramics, non-metallic mines, and local building materials enterprises can be put into production as early as possible. The meeting put forward specific measures and requirements for the production of cement, glass, bricks and tiles, non-metallic mineral products, etc., pointing out that building materials production must strictly implement national quality standards, establish necessary technical management systems, and strengthen batching, testing, thermal management, and inspection of raw materials entering and leaving the factory. In terms of variety, this year it is necessary to vigorously develop new products, produce lightweight, low-cost, and high-performance building materials to meet the needs of national construction. The capital construction of the building materials industry must focus on the four key aspects of project sequencing, resource exploration, equipment matching, and production preparation. For the production of gypsum, asbestos, mica, crystal, and other non-metallic mineral products that have been mined by the masses for a long time and have a certain foundation, a combination of national and mass methods should be adopted, actively providing assistance in terms of technology, machinery, materials, and funds, stipulating reasonable acquisition prices, and encouraging their development.

    集中优势力量建设重点工程
    建筑工程部布置设计施工和建筑材料生产任务
    新华社14日讯　六百多名来自全国各省市建筑部门、企业、科学研究部门和学校的代表，昨天在建筑工程部厅局长扩大会议的闭幕会上展开挑战应战，要在全国建筑系统内大闹技术革命，掀起一个以提高劳动生产率为中心的群众运动，把勘察设计、建筑安装、建筑材料生产、城市建设等工作推向高潮。
    这次会议开了十五天。会上总结了1958年的工作，布置了1959年的任务，还讨论了建筑部门的政治工作、城市建设、科学研究和教育工作等问题。
    1958年我国建筑业获得巨大成就，这一年完成的设计工作量比1957年增加四倍多，超过第一个五年计划完成设计工作量的总和，基本上扭转了过去设计赶不上施工的局面。由于推行快速施工，工期一般加快了一倍以上。工程成本大大降低，去年施工单位为国家节约的资金达五亿四千万元。工程质量绝大部分优良。建筑材料生产去年增加很多。去年还完成了一百四十三个大中城市的初步规划，进行了三百多个城市的市政工程建设。
    会议指出，今年建筑业任务比去年更大，而且工期急、工程结构复杂、技术要求高。许多重型机器厂、大型火力发电站等重要工程都要在今年开工，半数以上的工程要在今年完工投入生产。这就要求建筑业的职工们继续鼓足干劲、进一步贯彻多快好省的方针，克服建筑材料、施工机械和技术力量方面的困难，争取勘察设计、建筑安装、建筑材料生产等工作全面大跃进。
    今年，设计工作要在保持去年大跃进的速度下，大力提高设计质量和技术。工业设计要认真贯彻“坚固适用、经济合理、技术先进”的原则。各省市设计部门虽然作了不少工业设计，但急需提高技术，过好工业设计“关”，同时民用建筑设计也增加了，要肩挑双担。民用建筑设计要全面贯彻“经济、适用和可能条件下注意美观”的原则。设计工作仍要贯彻土洋结合的方针，不同工程的设计要有不同的要求。大中型工业建筑设计，应以洋法为主，适当地吸取土法生产的成功经验；小型工业设计，在不降低质量的原则下，可以多采用些土法或土洋结合的方法。
    今年建筑安装方面要在确保质量的前提下，大面积推行快速施工，使它成为经常化的施工方法。快速施工的速度要适当，要分别不同的施工单位和不同的工程对象。施工管理中，不仅要有工期指标，也要有质量、劳动生产率和成本指标。要注意改善建筑队伍的劳动组织和作业方法，加强快速施工准备工作和抓紧结尾工程，争取工程提早完工投入生产。
    会议强调今年建筑业特别要注意确保工程质量和施工安全。各建筑部门要推行有效的安全制度和技术检查、材料构件检查制度，以及做好隐蔽工程、竣工工程的验收工作。尤其是基础、钢筋混凝土、焊接、吊装等工程要及时严格检查，确保质量。
    关于施工项目排队，会议指出要贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神，分别轻重缓急，首先保证关键性的重点工程建设，特别是今年有生产任务的工程项目，应当尽先开工和及早完工。在建筑材料、机械和人力方面，强调要统一调度，集中使用。各建筑单位应当从整体出发，加强协作，保证重点工程的建设。要继续发动群众进行技术革命，从低级的工具改革到半机械化机械化，首先要全面推广行之有效的已定型的改良工具和新技术。要认真贯彻“两参、一改、三结合”。要根据具体情况有步骤地推行投资包干的办法，以充分调动建筑企业的积极性。
    今年，国家对建筑材料的需要量很大。会议提出建筑材料生产要坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，一手大力挖掘现有企业的生产潜力，展开优质高产运动，一手抓基本建设，加强矿山资源的勘探工作，扩大基本建设的规模，使水泥、玻璃、陶瓷、非金属矿和地方建筑材料企业的新建扩建工程都能及早地投入生产。会议对水泥、玻璃、砖瓦、非金属矿产品等生产提出了具体措施和要求，指出建筑材料生产必须严格执行国家质量指标，建立必要的技术管理制度，加强配料、化验、热工管理和原材料出入厂的检验工作。在品种方面，今年要大力发展新产品，生产轻质、价廉、高效能的建筑材料，以满足国家建设的需要。建筑材料工业基本建设要抓好项目排队、资源勘探、设备配套、生产准备工作四个环节。对那些群众开采已久，已有一定基础的石膏、石棉、云母、水晶等非金属矿产品的生产，要采取国家和群众相结合的办法，从技术、机具、材料和资金等方面积极给予帮助，规定合理的收购价格，鼓励其发展。（附图片）
