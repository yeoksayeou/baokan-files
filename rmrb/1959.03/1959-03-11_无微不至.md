　　Meticulous

　　In the middle of last year, the "All Japan Postage Stamp Popularization Association," established with the support of the Kishi Nobusuke government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, openly carried out propaganda hostile to the People's Republic of China in its organ newspaper "Postage Stamps," saying that "only Taiwan's stamps are China's legitimate stamps, and those issued by the People's Republic of China are local stamps."

　　Recently, hasn't Kishi Nobusuke repeatedly denied that he "has no intention of being hostile to China" in order to deceive public opinion and shirk responsibility? However, in reality, he is meticulously using even stamp collecting activities to serve his policy of hostility towards China. Moreover, when the newspaper "Postage Stamps" was blatantly carrying out propaganda hostile to China, it used the same clumsy methods as Kishi Nobusuke. Kishi Nobusuke keeps saying that he wants to "separate politics and economics" in the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, while this government-controlled newspaper also repeatedly advocated "not involving political issues." Here, can it be said that Kishi Nobusuke's lying skills are superior to those of "Postage Stamps"?

    无微不至
    去年中旬，在岸信介政府邮政省支持下成立的“全日本邮票普及会”，在它的机关报“邮票”上，公然进行敌视中华人民共和国的宣传，说什么“只有台湾的邮票才是中国的合法邮票，中华人民共和国发行的是地方的邮票”。
    最近，岸信介为了欺骗舆论和推卸责任，不是一再抵赖他“没有敌视中国的意思”吗？但是，实际上他是无微不至地连集邮活动也要利用来为他的敌视中国的政策服务。而且，“邮票”这家报纸在明目张胆地进行敌视中国的宣传时，使用了与岸信介同样拙劣的手法。岸信介口口声声说要在中日关系问题上把“政治和经济分开”，而这家御用报纸也连连主张“不要牵连政治问题”。在这里，能够说岸信介的撒谎本领比“邮票”高明一些吗！？
