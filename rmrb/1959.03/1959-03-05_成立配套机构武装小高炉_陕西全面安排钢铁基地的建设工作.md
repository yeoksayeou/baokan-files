    Establishing Supporting Organizations to Equip Small Blast Furnaces
    Shaanxi Comprehensively Arranges the Construction of Steel Bases
    (According to Shaanxi Daily news) In order to accelerate the construction of small blast furnaces, relevant departments in Shaanxi Province, such as mechanical processing and materials supply, have successively processed and manufactured 105 blowers and 127 different models of boiler-trolley engines for 34 small modern blast furnaces.
    Shaanxi Province has a total of 37 small blast furnace bases. Since the transition from small earthen furnace groups to small modern furnace groups meant that so many pieces of equipment could not be produced at once, a gradual equipping approach was adopted. At present, 22 small blast furnaces have been built, totaling 158 cubic meters, and nearly 1,000 tons of good iron have been produced. After a small blast furnace of 8 cubic meters in the Zhaozhen Iron Factory in Liquan County was put into production, its daily output reached about 8 tons. After the No. 4 small blast furnace of Lintong Iron Factory was put into production, the situation has been good. From January 21 to February 19 alone, it produced 75 tons of pig iron. In a high-yield production on February 6, it produced more than 10 tons of iron in 14 hours. However, all parties currently need pig iron, so it is necessary to speed up the construction of small blast furnaces. In order to accelerate this process, the relevant leading departments are actively taking measures to accelerate the construction of small blast furnaces. The Provincial Metallurgical Bureau has specifically established a supporting office and is working with mechanical processing and other units to study and solve the supporting problems of small blast furnaces. Comprehensive arrangements have also been made for the issues of infrastructure materials and construction forces. Around the establishment of these small blast furnaces, some coking plants, cement plants, refractory material plants, and small power plants will also be established. In addition, some earthen railways will be built in the areas connecting the mining areas and the main transportation lines to meet urgent needs.

    成立配套机构武装小高炉
    陕西全面安排钢铁基地的建设工作
    据陕西日报消息　为了加速小高炉的建设，陕西省机械加工、物资供应等有关部门，先后给三十四座小洋高炉加工制造了一百零五台鼓风机和型号不同的一百二十七台锅驼机。
    陕西省共有三十七个小高炉基地，由于由小土炉群转为小洋炉群一时拿不出这么多设备，因而采取了逐步装备的方针，目前已建成的小高炉达二十二座，共计一百五十八立方公尺，并已生产了近一千吨好铁。原醴泉县赵镇铁厂八立方公尺的一座小高炉投入生产后，日产量达到八吨上下。临潼铁厂四号小高炉投入生产后，情况一直良好，仅在1月21到2月19日，就生产了七十五吨生铁，在2月6日的一次高产当中，十四小时出了十吨多铁。但是，目前各方面都需要生铁，这样就不得不加快小高炉的建设速度。为了加速这方面的进程，有关领导部门正积极采取措施，加速小高炉的建设。省冶金局已专门成立了配套办公室，和机械加工等单位研究解决小高炉的配套问题；基建材料和施工力量问题，也都进行了全面安排。围绕这些小高炉的建立，还要建立一些炼焦厂、水泥厂、耐火材料厂和小型发电厂。除此而外，还要在矿区和交通干线连结的地方，修建一些土铁路，以应急需。
