Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 6th: The newspapers here today published a joint communiqué of the Bulgarian and Iraqi Communist Parties' talks.

The communiqué stated that at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, an Iraqi Communist Party delegation headed by Sailan Adiel, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party, paid a friendly visit to Bulgaria from February 24 to March 3 this year. During the visit, the delegation held talks with representatives of the Bulgarian Communist Party. During the talks, the two sides exchanged information on the situation in their respective countries and the activities of their respective parties, and exchanged views on all issues related to the international communist and workers' movement, and the struggle of the people of all countries to safeguard peace. The two sides expressed a spirit of complete understanding and agreement.

The communiqué stated that members of the Bulgarian Communist Party and all working people warmly welcomed the victories achieved by the Iraqi people in their struggle for freedom and national independence and against colonialism, welcomed the establishment of the Republic of Iraq headed by General Kassem, and welcomed the victories achieved by the Iraqi people in their struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution, consolidate national independence, and prosper economically and culturally.

The communiqué stated that the representatives of the two parties believe that "the victory of this struggle depends on the unity of all patriots and democratic forces in Iraq and other Arab countries." The communiqué pointed out that "Communists are the most active, courageous, and unwavering fighters against imperialism and the Zionist restorationist bourgeoisie."

The communiqué stated that the Iraqi Communist Party delegation "is convinced that the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a tested Marxist-Leninist party, will victoriously fulfill the tasks of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and achieve new and greater victories in socialist and communist construction."

Regarding the current international situation, the representatives of the two parties believe that "the forces of peace and democracy are constantly consolidating and developing. The forces of peace and democracy are greater than the forces of war and reaction. The strong pillar of the world's forces of peace and progress is the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

The communiqué stated that both sides fully support the Soviet government's proposals for the peaceful settlement of all disputes in international relations, the signing of a German peace treaty, the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, and the permanent cessation of nuclear weapons tests.

Both sides expressed full support for the heroic struggles of the people of Algeria, Oman, Yemen, and other countries to eliminate the colonial enslavement imposed on them by imperialist forces.

The communiqué condemned Yugoslav revisionism, stating that "the representatives of the two parties believe that the conspiracy of modern revisionism to lead the communist and workers' parties of all countries away from the path of Marxism-Leninism has been thoroughly defeated. The representatives of the two parties condemn Yugoslav revisionism for continuing to play tricks under the guise of 'national communism' and 'Arab communism,' splitting the fraternal relations between the communist and workers' parties of all countries, and undermining the unity between the patriotic and democratic forces in Arab countries and other countries that have gotten rid of imperialist enslavement and embarked on the path of national independence."

    保伊两国共产党发表会谈公报
    支持阿尔及利亚等国人民的反帝斗争
    谴责南修正主义者的分裂和破坏阴谋
    新华社索非亚6日电　这里的报纸今天公布了保加利亚和伊拉克两国共产党代表会谈公报。
    公报说，应保加利亚共产党中央的邀请，从今年2月24日到3月3日，以伊拉克共产党中央委员会书记赛兰·阿迭勒为首的伊共代表团在保加利亚进行了友好访问。访问期间，代表曾与保加利亚共产党代表进行了会谈。会谈时，双方交换了有关两国状况和两党活动的情况，并就有关国际共产主义和工人运动、各国人民维护和平斗争的一切问题交换了意见。会谈中双方表示了完全谅解和观点一致的精神。
    公报说，保加利亚共产党党员和全体劳动人民热烈欢迎伊拉克人民在争取自由和民族独立、反对殖民主义斗争中取得的胜利，欢迎以卡塞姆将军为首的伊拉克共和国的建立和伊拉克人民在捍卫革命胜利果实、巩固民族独立和繁荣经济文化斗争中取得的胜利。
    公报说，两党代表认为：这一斗争的胜利取决于伊拉克及阿拉伯其他国家所有爱国者和民主力量的团结一致。公报指出：“共产党员是反对帝国主义和犹太反动资产阶级的复国主义的最积极、勇敢和始终不渝的战士”。
    公报说，伊拉克共产党代表团“坚信保加利亚人民在久经考验的马克思列宁主义政党——保加利亚共产党的领导下，定将胜利地提前完成五年计划的任务，在社会主义和共产主义建设中，取得新的更大的胜利。”
    关于目前国际局势，两党代表认为，“和平和民主力量不断巩固和发展。和平和民主力量大于战争和反动力量。世界和平和进步力量的坚强支柱是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营”。
    公报说，双方完全支持苏联政府提出的关于和平解决国际关系中的一切争端，签订对德和约，把西柏林变成一个非军事化的自由城市，永远停止核武器试验等建议。
    双方表示完全支持阿尔及利亚、阿曼、也门等国人民为了消灭帝国主义势力加于他们的殖民主义奴役而进行的英勇斗争。
    公报在谴责南斯拉夫修正主义时说，“两党代表认为，现代修正主义的使各国共产党和工人党离开马克思、列宁主义道路的阴谋已遭到了彻底失败。两党代表谴责南斯拉夫修正主义在‘民族共产主义’、‘阿拉伯共产主义’等形式下继续玩弄阴谋、分裂各国共产党和工人党间的兄弟关系、破坏阿拉伯各国及其他已摆脱了帝国主义奴役，走上了民族独立道路的国家的爱国和民主力量间的团结”。
