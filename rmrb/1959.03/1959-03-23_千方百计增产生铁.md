In the iron and steel front, in order to fulfill and overfulfill the leaping plan of 18 million tons of steel, what is the most central link at present? From the perspective of production leadership and organization, we should firmly grasp the production of pig iron and, with iron smelting as the center, actively solve the supply of raw materials, first of all solving the production and supply of coal washing, ore, and coke.

Why should pig iron production be regarded as the central link? Because steel production is determined by iron production, and iron production is largely determined by the production of raw materials needed for iron smelting. That is to say, to ensure the completion of the 18 million tons of steel task, we must first produce a sufficient quantity of good iron; to produce a sufficient quantity of good iron, we must have a sufficient quantity of raw materials necessary for iron smelting, including coal washing, ore, coke, and refractory materials, etc. Therefore, the increase in raw materials required for iron smelting is a prerequisite for the increase in pig iron production. At present, the situation in steel production is: pig iron production cannot fully meet the needs of steelmaking, and the production of coal washing, ore, and coke cannot fully meet the needs of iron smelting. Here, iron production is precisely in the middle link. Now we need to grasp the middle and drive the two ends, that is, by grasping pig iron production, drive the production of raw materials such as coal washing, ore, and coke, and promote the leap in steel and steel products production. Therefore, in terms of organization and leadership, we must firmly grasp this central link of pig iron production.

How to grasp pig iron production tightly to catch up with the needs of steelmaking? The most important measure is to spare no effort to increase the daily output level of large, medium, and small blast furnaces, and complete the planned targets on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. To ensure the completion of the annual plan, we must first complete the quarterly plans; to complete the quarterly plans, we must first complete the monthly plans; to complete the monthly plans, we must first complete the plans for each ten-day period; and the completion of each ten-day plan must be based on the completion of the daily plan.

If we increase the daily output level of pig iron and maintain high output frequently, we will be in an active position. We must not think that if today is over, there is tomorrow; if this month is over, there is next month, because that will put us in a passive state. We know that the daily output level on the iron and steel front is not just a matter of iron and steel production, but a matter related to the entire production and construction. Our country relies on a large proportion of pig iron and steel produced in the current month and season for production and construction. If the daily, ten-day, and monthly production levels of iron and steel cannot be guaranteed, it will not only affect the development of the iron and steel industry itself, but also directly affect the major industrial and transportation departments. Therefore, earnestly grasping the daily output level of pig iron and adhering to it to the end, promoting high-yield and high-quality production of the iron and steel industry every ten days, every month, and every quarter, is a reliable measure to complete and overfulfill the entire industrial production with 18 million tons of steel as the key target.

To ensure that the large, medium, and small blast furnaces on the iron and steel front maintain above the specified production level on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and continue to improve, we must concentrate our efforts to overcome two bottlenecks: First, we must overcome the raw material bottleneck. Since last year, many small blast furnaces with certain mechanical equipment have been built in various places, with great production capacity. However, because the production of coking coal, washed coal, and coke has not kept up closely, some of the small blast furnaces that have already been built cannot produce normally. Therefore, vigorously increasing the production of coking coal, vigorously launching crash construction of simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens, producing enough good coke, and ensuring that blast furnaces produce more and better pig iron has become the first bottleneck to increase pig iron production. The production level of pig iron is closely inseparable from the production level of raw materials. If the daily production level of raw materials is not guaranteed, the daily production level of pig iron cannot be guaranteed. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, given the availability of raw materials, how to make careful calculations and save raw materials to produce more pig iron is also a very important aspect. Last year, under normal production conditions, large and medium-sized blast furnaces using modern methods required 700 to 800 kilograms of coke, approximately equivalent to more than two tons of raw coal, to produce one ton of pig iron. The proportion of coke consumption in general small blast furnaces was even greater. This year, the coke ratio situation in various places has improved somewhat, but the phenomenon of excessive coke consumption still exists. Is it possible to use less coke and produce more iron? This is entirely possible. For example, a small blast furnace with a volume of 6.5 cubic meters in the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant in Zhuoxian County consumes only a little more than one ton of coke to produce one ton of iron, which is much lower than other small blast furnaces of the same type. If all small blast furnaces can save half a ton of coke, then several million tons of coke can be saved by producing ten million tons of pig iron. It can be seen that starting from reducing coke consumption and saving raw material consumption is also an important way to increase pig iron production.

Second, we must overcome the technical bottleneck and improve the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces. At present, the utilization coefficients of blast furnaces vary greatly from place to place. From September of last year, the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has continuously produced more than two tons of iron per cubic meter of effective volume for six consecutive months. In February of this year, it made further leaps, reaching 2.212 tons, which means that every 1,000 cubic meters of effective blast furnace volume produces 2,212 tons of pig iron per day and night. However, the utilization coefficient of some blast furnaces is much lower than this figure. If the utilization coefficients of blast furnaces in key enterprises can approach those of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant in Benxi, then there will be a greater leap in this year's pig iron production. If the utilization coefficient of each cubic meter of effective volume of small blast furnaces in various places can gradually reach more than 0.7 to 0.8 tons in the high-yield and high-quality competition, then small blast furnaces can increase the production of a huge amount of pig iron every day.

The daily output level is an important indicator for evaluating the organizational leadership and production technology management level of an enterprise. It is also a concrete reflection of the depth of the mass movement in production, and it is the concentrated expression of the labor achievements of technical personnel and workers in production departments and auxiliary departments. Due to different conditions in various places, the monthly daily output level will inevitably be high and low, and cannot be absolutely the same, but it should not be too disparate. It is necessary to basically complete the plan on a daily basis, and then achieve greater leaps at a certain production level. According to reports from various places, production rises linearly wherever the leadership grasps tightly and early, and where the mass movement has been carried out in depth. It can be seen that it is of great significance to quickly launch a mass production competition movement centered on high yield and high quality and centered on technological revolution on the iron and steel production front, so that the leadership and the broad masses organize their own production around improving the daily output level. The broad masses are the source of strength and the ocean of wisdom, and socialist competition is an important method to fully mobilize the masses to accelerate socialist construction. As long as the broad masses throw themselves into the wave of production competition, and production management and technical measures are closely followed up to solve the problems, then we will have a solid and reliable foundation for improving the daily output level of each blast furnace and each mine.

Comrades on the iron and steel front! The bugle of the great competition has sounded! Opportunities are not to be missed, and time will not come again. Time is iron, time is steel. Let us focus on the key to improving the daily output level of pig iron, continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act on the basis of last year's great leap forward, and hold high the red flag of high yield and high quality of iron and steel, and forge ahead bravely!

    千方百计增产生铁
    在钢铁战线上，为了完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢的跃进计划，当前最中心的环节是什么？从生产领导和组织方面来说，应当紧紧抓住生铁的生产，并以炼铁为中心，积极解决原材料的供应，首先是解决洗煤、矿石和焦炭的生产供应。
    为什么要把生铁生产当做中心环节来看待呢？因为钢的生产决定于铁的生产，铁的生产在很大程度上又决定于炼铁所需要的原材料生产。这就是说，要保证完成一千八百万吨钢的任务，首先必须生产出足够数量的好铁；要生产足够数量的好铁，又必须有炼铁所必需的足够数量的原料，包括洗煤、矿石、焦炭和耐火材料等等。因此炼铁所需的原材料的增长，又是生铁产量增长的前提。当前，钢铁的生产情况是：生铁的生产还不能完全满足炼钢的需要，而洗煤、矿石、焦炭的生产又不能完全满足炼铁的需要。这里铁的生产恰恰处于中间环节。现在需要抓中间、带两头，这就是通过抓生铁生产，把洗煤、矿石、焦炭等原材料生产带动起来，又促使钢和钢材的生产跃上去。因此，在组织领导上就必须紧紧抓住生铁生产这个中心环节。
  怎样抓紧生铁的生产赶上炼钢的需要呢？最重要的措施就是千方百计地提高大中小高炉的日产水平，按日按旬按月完成计划指标。我们要确保年计划的完成，首先必须完成各个季度计划；要完成季度计划，首先就要完成月计划；要完成月计划，首先必须完成每旬的计划；而每旬计划的完成，又必须以完成日计划做基础。
    提高生铁的日产水平，使其经常保持高产，我们就处于主动地位。切不可以为过了今天，还有明天；过了这个月，还有下个月，那样就会使我们处于被动状态。我们知道：钢铁战线上的日产水平不仅仅是钢铁生产的问题，而是关系到整个生产建设的问题。我们的国家依靠当月当季生产的生铁钢材用于生产建设的占有很大的比重，如果钢铁的每日、每旬、每月的生产水平不能保证，不仅影响到钢铁工业本身的发展，而且直接影响到各主要工业交通部门。所以，认真抓住生铁日产水平并坚持到底，促进钢铁工业旬旬、月月、季季高产优质，是完成和超额完成以一千八百万吨钢为纲的整个工业生产的可靠措施。
    要使钢铁战线上的大中小高炉按日按旬按月保持在规定的生产水平之上，并且不断提高，必须集中力量攻打两个关口：第一、要攻打原料关。去年以来，各地兴建了不少有一定机械装备的小高炉，生产能力很大。但由于焦煤、洗煤、炼焦的生产还没有紧紧跟上去，一部分已经建设起来的小高炉不能正常生产。因此，大力增产炼焦煤、大力突击建设简易洗煤厂和简易炼焦炉，生产足够的好焦炭，保证高炉炼出更多更好的生铁，就成为提高生铁产量的第一个关口。生铁的生产水平同原料的生产水平是密切不可分离的，如果原料的日产水平没有保证，生铁的日产水平也就不能保证，这是一方面。但另一方面，在有了原料的情况下，如何精打细算、节约原料以生产更多的生铁，也是一个很重要的方面。去年，每炼一吨生铁，在生产正常的情况下，大、中型的用现代方法生产的高炉需要焦炭七百到八百公斤，大约相当于两吨多的原煤，一般的小高炉消耗焦炭的比例则很大。今年，各地焦比情况已经有了一些改进，然而耗焦过多的现象仍然存在。能不能少用点焦炭多出一点铁呢？这是完全可能的。例如涿县第一钢铁厂一座容积六点五立方公尺的小高炉，生产一吨铁的焦炭消耗，只有一吨多一点，大大低于其它同类型小高炉。如果所有小高炉都能节约半吨焦炭，那么，生产一千万吨生铁就可以节约几百万吨焦炭。可见从降低焦炭的消耗量着手节约原料消耗，也是增产生铁的一条重要的出路。
    第二、要攻打技术关，提高高炉的利用系数。目前，各地高炉的利用系数相差很大。本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂，高炉利用系数从去年9月份起，连续六个月每立方公尺有效容积所产的铁达到二吨以上，今年2月一再跃进，达到二点二一二吨，这就是说，每一千立方公尺高炉有效容积每昼夜生产二千二百一十二吨生铁。可是有些高炉的利用系数却大大低于这个数字。假如各重点企业高炉的利用系数都能接近本溪第一炼铁厂，那么，今年的生铁产量就会出现一个更大的跃进。如果各地小高炉每个立方公尺有效容积的利用系数，能够在高产优质竞赛运动中，逐渐达到零点七到零点八吨以上，那末，小高炉每天就可以增产巨大数量的生铁。
    日产水平是考核一个企业的组织领导和生产技术管理水平的重要标志，也是群众运动的深度在生产上的具体反映，是生产部门和辅助部门技术人员和工人劳动成果的集中表现。由于各地的条件不同，每月的日产水平总难免有高有低，不能绝对相同，但也不应过分悬殊。必须基本上做到按日完成计划，然后在一定的生产水平上取得更大的跃进。据各地情况反映：凡是领导上抓得紧、抓得早，而群众运动已深入开展的地方，生产就直线上升。可见在钢铁生产战线上迅速开展一个以高产优质为目的，以技术革命为中心的群众生产竞赛运动，使领导和广大群众围绕着提高日产水平组织自己的生产，在目前有十分重大的意义。广大群众是力量的泉源、智慧的海洋，社会主义竞赛又是充分发动群众加速社会主义建设的重要方法。只要广大群众投进了生产竞赛的浪潮，而生产管理和技术措施又紧跟着加以解决，那末，我们提高每座高炉、每个矿井的日产水平也就有了牢固可靠的基础。
    钢铁战线上的同志们！大竞赛的号角已经响起来了！机不可失，时不再来，时间就是铁就是钢，让我们围绕着提高生铁日产水平的关键，在去年大跃进的基础上，继续发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，高高举起钢铁高产优质的红旗，奋勇前进！
