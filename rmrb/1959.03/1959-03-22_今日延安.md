    Yan'an Bridge
    Anyone who has been to Yan'an clearly remembers that beneath the majestic Pagoda Hill, the winding Yan River stretches out, dividing Yan'an City into two halves. Whenever mountain floods erupt and the river swells, traffic on the east and west banks of the Yan River is cut off.
    For years, how Yan'an people have longed to build a bridge over the Yan River!
    Now, a three-arch stone bridge has been built. The bridge is 45 zhang long and 3.3 zhang wide, allowing cars to pass side by side. The bridge is built according to the style of the famous Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei.
    Viewed from the lower reaches of the Yan River, the bridge looks like it is inlaid on the waist of the two mountains. The clear river water flows slowly under the huge arches, and the solemn pagoda stands impressively above the bridge.
    "The Second Battle of Panlong"
    In 1947, a fierce battle took place in Panlong Town. The heroic People's Liberation Army annihilated a brigade of the Hu Zongnan bandit army here, starting the victorious counter-offensive in the Northwest battlefield.
    Now, another new battle is being fought here. On the two hilltops where the battle was fiercest, and on the newly built terraced fields, are crowds of people accumulating and transporting fertilizer. Wisps of smoke rise from the winding mountain gullies, and the sounds of people shouting and various metals clanging blend together. Several iron-smelting plants, oil refineries, cement plants, and many small coal mines that have been built have already turned this place into one of the industrial bases in the Yan'an area.
    Disabled veterans such as Liu Shiying, Guo Wenchang, and He Fengfu, who participated in the Panlong battle, are again participating in the battle to conquer nature here. They proudly call this battle the "Second Battle of Panlong."
    Today's Wayao Fort
    Today's Wayao Fort is a thriving scene.
    At night, the hillside is lit up. In this mountain city surrounded by mountains and rivers, the newly built power plant recently sent out its first current. On the mountain opposite the Zichang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Committee, rows of coking ovens spew out dazzling flames, illuminating half of the hillside. The site of the famous Wayao Fort Conference and the tomb of Comrade Xie Zichang, one of the founders of the Shaanxi-Gansu Red Army, stand opposite each other in this mountain city.
    The glorious revolutionary tradition inspires the people of Zichang County to soar into the sky in the era of the Great Leap Forward. This year, people are fighting to double last year's total grain output on the basis of doubling it last year. A large number of iron-smelting plants, oil refineries, coking plants, and many small coal kilns have also been built.
    A Glimpse of Nanniwan
    Going south along the highway from Nanchuan in Yan'an, over a large mountain, the river valley becomes wider and wider, and neat paddy fields gradually appear in front of you, with lush forests at the foot of the continuous steep mountains on both sides. This is the famous Nanniwan. In 1941, the 359th Brigade reclaimed wasteland here. After two years of hard work, the troops basically achieved self-sufficiency in their lives, becoming a pioneering feat in world history. Last year, under the initiative of old Red Army soldiers Liu Baozhai, Wei Zhicai, and others, the farmers of Nanniwan built four reservoirs in several nearby gullies, irrigating more than 500 mu of land downstream, basically realizing water conservancy. Each mu produced more than 400 jin of grain, becoming the first township in Yan'an County to achieve the agricultural development program targets last year.
    The center of Nanniwan, Yangwan, now has more than a dozen newly built tile-roofed houses, as well as shops, schools, clinics, and post offices. In the evening, the lights are on, and bright lights are reflected in the windows of every house. The street lights on the mountains and mountainsides make this remote mountain valley particularly beautiful.
    From Shangxialong to Jiulongquan, there are many cave dwellings on the hillsides along the way. These were the barracks of the 359th Brigade in those years. Under the hillside, the old site of the "Soldiers' Production Cooperative" remains the same. The 359th Brigade Monument in Jiulongquan, which had been damaged by the enemy, has now been repaired. At the entrance of Taobaoyu Gully, the red building of the artillery school still maintains its original appearance.
    Red Iron Smelting Plant
    More than ten miles away from Wayao Fort, in a gully, there is an iron-smelting plant established by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government in 1944 - the Yaping Iron Smelting Plant. This red iron-smelting plant of that year has radiated its light again in the new historical period.
    In those days, people responded to the great call of "self-reliance" put forward by Chairman Mao, overcame the numerous difficulties caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of the border area, and smelted pig iron here to cast a large number of farm tools, supplying the raw materials needed by the border area's arsenal.
    In last year's mass movement to make steel, old workers from the border region era, Duan Yingcai and Li Shenggao, came to this iron-smelting plant again to serve as technical guidance. This "Red Iron Smelting Plant," which had been closed for more than ten years, once again poured out fiery red molten iron.
    Flowers and Trees Planted by Youth
    Most of the precious flowers and trees planted in Yan'an by the representatives of the Five-Province Youth Afforestation Conference in the spring of 1956 have survived.
    In the spring, in the courtyard of Chairman Mao's former residence, Zaoyuan, the dawn redwood and ginkgo trees transplanted from the West Lake in Hangzhou are blooming and gracefully standing tall. The snow pines from the Himalayas are verdant and bright, and the golden larch is tender yellow and lovely. The peach trees, osmanthus trees, roses, and dragon whisker willows transplanted in Yangjialing are also graceful, adding infinite scenery to the revolutionary holy land.
    More than 10,000 cypress trees planted by the youth representatives of the five provinces on the hillside of Yangjialing have also survived. The young people of Yan'an are particularly concerned about these flowers and trees, and often organize voluntary labor to cultivate the soil, water, and prune the branches.
    Yan'an University
    Above Yangjialing, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived, the loud singing of young people can be heard from time to time. At the foot of Yangjialing, there are two rows of cave dwellings and several bungalows, which is the site of the newly established Yan'an University last year.
    Three hundred university students from Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Guanzhong, Southern Shaanxi, and Northern Shaanxi are studying, working, and living here. Currently, this school has three departments: Chinese, Mathematics, and Physics and Chemistry. In a few years, it will expand to three thousand teachers and students and more than ten departments.
    On the first day the teachers and students of Yan'an University came here, they started to level the playground, build roads, plant trees, transport bricks and tiles, and burn lime, participating in labor to build the school. In their spare time, they also helped the nearby farmers to build terraced fields, harvest crops, carry water, and sweep courtyards, and visited the neighbors in the neighborhood. Farmers were often invited to the school to participate in conferences and get-togethers. People can see here the epitome of many red schools in Yan'an during the Anti-Japanese War.

专栏：

    今日延安
    延安大桥
    到过延安的人都还清楚地记得：在巍峨的宝塔山下，伸展着蜿蜒曲折的延河，它把延安市分成了两半。每逢山洪暴发，河水猛涨，延河东西两岸的交通就被阻隔。
    多少年来，延安人民多么渴望着在延河上修建一座大桥呵！
    现在，一座三孔石桥已经修建起来。桥长四十五丈，宽三丈三尺，可以并行汽车。大桥是按照著名的河北赵州桥的形式建筑的。
    从延河下游远远望去，大桥就好像镶嵌在两山之腰。清清的河水从巨大的穹拱下缓缓流过，庄严的宝塔俨然矗立在大桥上面。
    “第二次蟠龙大战”
    1947年，在蟠龙镇曾经进行过一场激烈的战斗。英勇的人民解放军在这儿歼灭了胡宗南匪军一个旅，开始了西北战场的胜利反攻。
    现在，这儿又在进行着另一次新的战斗。在当年战斗最激烈的两个山头上，在层层新修的水平梯田上，是积肥、运肥的人群。弯弯曲曲的山沟里，升起了缕缕炊烟，人的喧叫声、各种金属的敲击声合在一起。已建成的好多个炼铁厂、炼油厂、水泥厂和许多小煤矿，已经把这儿变成延安地区工业基地之一了。
    当年参加过蟠龙战役的刘士英、郭文昌和贺凤福等残废军人，又在这里参加了征服大自然的战斗。他们骄傲地把这个战斗称做“第二次蟠龙大战”。
    今日瓦窑堡
    今日瓦窑堡真是一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    入夜，半山坡上一片灯火。在这座依山傍水的山城，新建的电厂不久前送出了第一股电流。在中共子长县委和县人民委员会的对面山上，一排排炼焦窑喷射着耀眼的火焰，映红了半个山坡。著名的瓦窑堡会议遗址和陕北红军创始人之一的谢子长烈士的陵墓，在这个山城里遥遥相对。
    光荣的革命传统在大跃进的年代里激励着子长县人民的冲天干劲。今年，人们正为在去年全年粮食产量翻一番的基础上再翻一番而奋战。大批炼铁厂、炼油厂、炼焦厂和许多小煤窑也已建设起来。
   南泥湾剪影
    从延安的南川沿着公路南行，翻过一架大山，川道越来越宽，眼前逐渐出现了整齐的稻田，两旁连绵不断的陡山脚下是蓊郁的树林。这就是著名的南泥湾。1941年，三五九旅在这里开荒生产，经过两年苦干，部队生活基本上达到自给自足，成为世界历史上的创举。去年，南泥湾的农民在老红军刘宝寨、魏志才等人的倡议下，农民们在附近几个沟岔里修筑了四个水库，灌溉了下游的五百多亩土地，基本实现了水利化，每亩产粮食四百多斤，成为延安县去年第一个实现农业发展纲要指标的乡。
    南泥湾的中心——羊湾，现在新修了十几幢瓦房，还设了商店、学校、卫生所和邮局。晚间，电灯亮了，家家窗户上映着明亮的灯光，山上山下的路灯，把这个偏僻的山沟照得格外美丽。
    从上下龙到九龙泉，沿途山坡上有许多窑洞。这是当年三五九旅的营房，山坡下，“军人生产合作社”的旧址依然如故。九龙泉的三五九旅纪念碑，曾遭受敌人破坏，现在又修复起来了。桃保峪沟口，当年炮兵学校的红色楼房，仍然保持着过去的原样。
    红色炼铁厂
    距离瓦窑堡十多里的一条沟里，有一座在1944年由陕甘宁边区政府建立起来的炼铁厂——芽坪炼铁厂。这个当年的红色炼铁厂，在新的历史时期中又发射出了它的光芒。
    当年，人们响应毛主席提出的“自力更生”的伟大号召，克服了由于国民党反动派封锁边区所造成的重重困难，从这里炼出生铁铸造了大批农具，供应着边区兵工厂所需要的原料。
    去年大搞钢铁的群众运动中。边区时代的老工人段英才和李生高等又来到这个炼铁厂担任了技术指导。这座停办了十多年的“红色炼铁厂”，重新流出火红的铁水。
    青年栽植的花木
    1956年春天，五省青年造林大会的代表在延安栽植的名贵花木，大部成活了。
    春天，在毛主席故居——枣园的院落里，从杭州西湖畔移来的水衫、银杏，花枝招展，亭亭玉立。喜马拉雅山的雪松，翠绿雪亮，金钱松嫩黄可爱。移栽在杨家岭的碧桃、桂花、玫瑰、龙须柳等也都绰约多姿，给革命圣地增添了无限景色。
    五省青年代表在杨家岭山坡上栽植的一万多株柏树，也都成活。延安青年对这些花木，格外关心，经常组织义务劳动去培土、浇水和剪枝。
    延安大学
    在党中央和毛主席住过的杨家岭的上空，不时地传来年青人的嘹亮歌声。在杨家岭的脚下，有两排窑洞和几幢平房，这就是去年新办的延安大学的校址。
    来自北京、上海、西安、关中、陕南和陕北的三百个大学生，正在这里学习、劳动和生活。现在这个学校有中文、数学和理化三系，几年后将扩展到三千师生和十多个学系。
    延安大学的师生们来到这里的第一天，就动手平整操场、修路、植树、运砖瓦和烧石灰，参加劳动建校。他们还在课余的时候，帮助附近农民修梯田、收秋、挑水、扫院子，拜访左邻右舍的乡亲，农民们也常被请到学校来参加大会和联欢会。人们从这里可看到抗战时期延安许多红色学校的缩影。　（附图片）
