Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 4th: The idea of agricultural collectivization is increasingly taking root in the Polish countryside, and the broad masses of farmers are gradually realizing from practical experience that agricultural cooperatives are superior to individual farming.

Recently, agricultural production cooperatives in various provinces of Poland carried out the distribution of agricultural income for 1958, and many cooperatives combined this work with celebrations of the tenth anniversary of their establishment. The facts during the distribution of agricultural income show that the output of agricultural production cooperatives is much higher than that of individual farmers. The national average yield of four grains per hectare in agricultural production cooperatives reached 17.4 quintals, 17.6% higher than the average yield per hectare of individual farmers. The increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives is not only in terms of grain, but also the number of livestock continues to increase. In the first three quarters of last year alone, the number of livestock in many agricultural production cooperatives in the Voivodeship of Wolomin, calculated per 100 hectares of land, greatly exceeded the average for the province. The agricultural cooperatives in the province increased by an average of four cattle and four pigs per 100 hectares of land.

Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions continue to invest heavily in improving agricultural production.

As agricultural production cooperatives continue to develop in production, the income of their members has generally increased. In this year's agricultural income distribution, the income of members in Szczecin Province increased by 15% compared to the previous year. The income of each working day in the Ksawalowa Cooperative in Lodz Province increased by six zlotys compared to the previous year.

The continuous development of agricultural production cooperatives attracts the attention of the broad masses of farmers, and more and more farmers are requesting to join. Farmers who once withdrew from the cooperatives are requesting to rejoin. According to statistics at the end of 1958, there were a total of 1,838 cooperatives in Poland, with more than 29,000 members, of which 215 cooperatives were newly established in the past year. Agricultural production cooperatives, like lighthouses, illuminate the way forward for farmers.

Currently, there are more and more farmers who want to join agricultural production cooperatives day by day.

    合作化思想在波兰日益深入人心
    各地农业社显示优越性　要求入社农民越来越多
    据新华社华沙4日电　农业合作化思想在波兰农村中日益深入人心，广大农民群众逐渐从生活的实践中认识到农业合作化比个体经营具有优越性。
    最近，波兰各省的农业生产合作社进行了1958年农业收入的分配工作，许多合作社结合这一工作进行了建社十周年的庆祝活动。分配农业收入过程中的事实表明，农业生产合作社的产量大大高于个体农民。全国农业生产合作社每公顷四种谷物的平均收获量高达十七点四公担，比个体农民每公顷的平均收获量高17.6％。农业生产合作社的增产不仅在粮食方面，而且牲畜的头数也不断增加。仅去年三个季度内，以每一百公顷土地计算，沃波累省很多农业生产合作社牲畜的头数大大超过该省的平均数。该省的农业合作社每一百公顷土地平均增加四头牛，四口猪。
    各地的农业生产合作社都继续大批投资，用来提高农业生产。
    由于农业生产合作社在生产上得到了不断发展，因此社员的收入普遍增加。在今年的农业收入分配中，什切青省社员的收入比上一年增加了15％。罗兹省克萨瓦洛瓦合作社每一个劳动日的收入比上一年增加了六个兹罗提。
    农业生产合作社生产上的不断发展吸引着广大农民的注意，要求入社的农民逐渐增多。一度退出合作社的农民又请求重新入社。截至1958年底的统计，波兰共有一千八百三十八个合作社，社员达二万九千多户，其中二百一十五个合作社是去年一年内新建立的。农业生产合作社像灯塔一样，照耀着农民前进的道路。
    目前，要求参加农业生产合作社的农民一天多似一天。
