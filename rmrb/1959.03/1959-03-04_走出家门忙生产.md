    Going Out of the Home to Busy Oneself with Production
    In Wanglong Work Area, Guangxi, whenever Mo Guangrong is mentioned, everyone praises her: "Good woman! Good woman!" But before the establishment of the commune, she was still a housewife who spent all day revolving around the stove.
    She has three children, the oldest is seven years old, and the youngest is not yet one year old. In the past, all the housework for a family of five fell on her shoulders. Every day before dawn, she would get up, heat the water for washing faces, fill the water tank, clean up the children's urine and feces, and then cook. After eating, she had to find pig feed, vegetables, and wash clothes. Then, she had to cook again. Like this, from morning to night, she was so busy that she didn't even have time to make shoes for her children.
    Last autumn, when the people's commune was established, Mo Guangrong was the first to sign up to participate.
    Once Mo Guangrong jumped out of the tedious circle of housework, she actively participated in agricultural production. During the intensive plowing campaign, she got up before dawn, shouldered her hoe and rushed to the boiling fields. After the intensive plowing ended, the commune launched a new production upsurge centered on accumulating fertilizer. At that time, the weather was very cold, and there was also a drizzle. Mo Guangrong and the commune members crossed a big mountain to Longge Pond to accumulate fertilizer. She rolled up her trouser legs and went into the pond to dig pond mud, carrying each load fully. In one day, she dug more than two hundred loads of pond mud. In every task, she received praise from the commune members, and she was also frequently praised by the team and the work area. In addition, she also took time during holidays and evenings to make new shoes for each child.

    走出家门忙生产
    在广西旺龙工区，只要提起莫光容，人人都会啧啧称赞：“好妇女！好妇女！”可是，就在公社成立前，她还是整天围着锅台打转的家庭妇女哩。
    她有三个孩子，大的七岁，小的还没满一周岁。过去，一家五口人的家务都落在她肩上。每天天未亮，她便起床，烧好洗脸水，担满水缸水，揩洗完孩子的尿屎，就得煮饭。吃过饭又得觅?菜、洗衣服。接着，又得煮饭。就这样，从早到晚，忙得不可开交，连孩子的鞋子也没有空做。
    去年秋天，成立人民公社，莫光容第一个报名参加。
    莫光容一跳出繁琐的家务圈子，便积极参加农业生产。大闹深耕时，天未亮她就起床，扛起锄头便奔向沸腾的田野去了。深耕结束后，公社又掀起了一个以积肥为中心的新的生产高潮。当时天气很冷，还洒着细雨，莫光容天刚亮便和社员越过一座大山，到龙格塘去积肥。她卷起裤腿下塘挖塘泥，每担都担得满满的。一天时间，她便掘了二百多担塘泥。在每次工作中，她都得到社员的好评，还经常得到队里和工区的表扬。另外，她还抽出假日和晚上的时间，给每个孩子都做了新鞋。
