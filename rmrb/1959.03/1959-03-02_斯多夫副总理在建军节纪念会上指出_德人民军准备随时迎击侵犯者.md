Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 1st. Several thousand people from all walks of life in Berlin held a celebration on the evening of the 28th to commemorate the third anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic's National People's Army.

    German Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, General Stoph, spoke at the meeting. He severely condemned the Adenauer government for restoring militarism and its war cries in West Germany. General Stoph said that the National People's Army is ready at any time to fight off any enemies who dare to invade the German Democratic Republic, together with the armed forces of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    He also described the achievements of the National People's Army in the three years since its establishment. He particularly pointed out that the recent decision of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party regarding generals and officers spending four weeks a year as soldiers in the companies will further strengthen the relationship between officers and soldiers in the army.

    The Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army Forces stationed in Germany, General M.V. Zakharov, congratulated the growing strength of the National People's Army. He stated that the Soviet Army will do everything possible to support the German Democratic Republic and will not allow any enemy to infringe upon the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. Members of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party, Neumann and Honecker, as well as military attachés from various countries to Germany, attended the celebration.

    Today, "Neues Deutschland" published congratulatory letters from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, President Pieck, the Council of Ministers, and the National Front, congratulating the National People's Army on its third anniversary.
