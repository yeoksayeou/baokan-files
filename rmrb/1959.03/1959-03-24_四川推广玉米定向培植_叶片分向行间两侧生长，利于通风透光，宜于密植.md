(Our Chengdu dispatch, March 23rd) On the eve of the corn planting season, Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting a significant innovation in corn cultivation techniques—the directional cultivation method—to strive for large-scale, high-yield corn production on ten million mu across the province this year.

The directional cultivation method for corn was created by the Shangxia People's Commune in Xuanhan County during the Great Leap Forward last year. This cultivation method involves studying the tillering patterns of corn and improving planting methods to make the corn leaves grow in a designated direction. In the past, the height and size of corn stalks and leaves greatly restricted dense planting. Adopting the directional cultivation method can resolve the contradiction between dense planting and ventilation and light transmission.

Last year, the Sixth Brigade of the Shangxia Commune used this method for single-seed, dense planting, allowing corn leaves to grow towards both sides of the rows. The planting specifications generally reached row spacing of two to three chi (Chinese feet) and plant spacing of three to four cun (Chinese inches), planting seven thousand to ten thousand corn plants per mu. Centered on dense planting, and with the addition of deep plowing, heavy application of base fertilizer, and the use of improved varieties, the brigade's 340 mu of corn achieved an average yield of 1,029 jin (Chinese pounds) per mu, with more than two mu reaching a yield of over 2,175 jin per mu. This is three to four times higher than the local average yield.

The key to the directional cultivation method is arranging the seeds in a specific direction during planting. The creator of this method, Zhang Mingde, the Party Secretary of the Shangxia Commune, conducted three trials to determine the pattern for making corn leaves grow towards both sides of the rows. This pattern is to "arrange lengthwise and place horizontally"—when planting, align the long side of the corn seed (from top to bottom) with the direction of the planting row, and place the seed with its flat side horizontal. Because the corn germinates from the flat side, the direction of tillering is absolutely perpendicular to the long side. This arrangement ensures that the leaves grow consistently towards both sides of the rows, facilitating ventilation and light transmission, and the plant spacing can be greatly reduced. On this basis, using the staggered-nest planting method to stagger the corn plants between rows can appropriately reduce the row spacing. The Shangxia Commune successfully used this method last year.

Xuanhan County is one of the famous mountainous counties in Sichuan. The average altitude of cultivated land in the Shangxia Commune is on slopes ranging from 700 to 1,700 meters. In the past, due to extensive cultivation, corn only yielded over 100 jin per mu. In 1957, after Zhang Mingde became the Party Secretary, he and the commune cadres took the lead in promoting many advanced techniques such as dense planting and deep plowing. In their first dense planting experiment, they did not achieve the expected yield due to ventilation and light transmission problems. However, he was inspired by the farmers' saying, "For corn to cob, leaves must not touch leaves." Last spring, based on the characteristic of corn leaves growing only to both sides, he conducted research and finally succeeded after several failures.

Promoting the directional cultivation method is labor-intensive if seeds are arranged manually. This problem has also been solved through the joint efforts of Zhang Mingde and the commune members. They created a "directional planter." Just put the selected seeds into the device, and the seeds will automatically line up in the planting direction and be sown, which is five to six times more efficient than manual labor, allowing each person to plant nine to ten mu per day.

Currently, activities to promote the directional dense planting method for corn have been widely launched in various parts of Sichuan. The Mianyang Special District is rushing to manufacture 200,000 directional planters, and all corn in the district has been decided to implement directional dense planting. The Nanchong Special District has also organized a specialized technical team to go deep into the countryside to provide technical guidance.

### 四川推广玉米定向培植  叶片分向行间两侧生长，利于通风透光，宜于密植

    四川推广玉米定向培植
    叶片分向行间两侧生长，利于通风透光，宜于密植
    本报成都23日电　在玉米播种即将开始之前，四川省为了争取全省今年一千万亩玉米大面积高产，正在大力推广玉米栽培技术上的一项重大创造——玉米定向培植法。
    玉米定向培植法是宣汉县上峡人民公社在去年大跃进中创造的。这种培植法是通过对玉米分蘖规律的研究，改进播种方法，使玉米叶按照指定的方向生长。过去，由于玉米秆高叶大，使玉米密植受到很大限制。采取定向培植法，就能解决密植和通风透光之间的矛盾。
    去年，上峡公社的第陆大队采用这一方法，进行单株密播，使玉米叶向行间两边分长，播种规格一般达到行距二尺多到三尺，株距三寸到四寸，每亩种玉米七千株到一万株。以密植为中心，加上深耕、重施底肥、采用良种等措施，全队三百四十亩玉米平均亩产达到一千零二十九斤，其中并有两亩多达到亩产二千一百七十五斤多。这比当地一般产量高出三、四倍。
    定向培植法的关键在于播种时将种籽排列一定的方向。这个方法的创造者——中共上峡公社党委书记张明德为此曾先后进行了三次试验，得出了使玉米叶向行间两边分长的规律。这就是必须把种籽“顺排横放”——播种时使玉米种子顶端至底部所构成的长的一方和播种行的方向一致，种子的横面平面放置。由于玉米是从横面上发芽，分蘖方向和长的一方成绝对垂直，这样排列就保证了叶片一致向行间两侧生长，利于通风透光，株距可以大大缩短。在这一基础上，再采用错窝排播的方法，把行与行间玉米植株错开，就能使行距适当的缩小。去年上峡社就是采取这种办法得到成功。
    宣汉县是四川著名的山区县份之一。上峡社耕地平均高度都在七百到一千七百公尺的山坡上。过去，由于耕作粗放，玉米只亩产一百多斤。1957年，张明德担任党委书记后，就和社干部们带头推行密植、深耕等许多先进技术。他们在第一次进行密植试验中，由于通风透光问题而没有达到预期产量。但他从农民的“要得包谷结，不准叶挨叶”的话中得到启发。去年春天，他根据玉米只向两边长叶的特点进行研究，经过几次失败，终于成功。
    推行定向培植法，若用人工排列种子，费工费时。这个问题经过张明德和社员们的共同努力也得到了解决。他们创造了一种“定向种植器”，只需将选好的种子放入器内，种子就能自行按播种方向排好播下，比人工工效高五到六倍，每人每天能播种九到十亩。
    目前，四川各地推广玉米定向密植培植法的活动已广泛展开。绵阳专区正在赶造二十万部定向播种器，全区玉米都决定实行定向密植。南充专区还组织一支专门的技术队伍，深入农村进行技术指导。
