Prevent Wheat Lodging by Every Possible Means
Sichuan's Some Lodged Wheat Recovered to Normal After Rescue
Chengdu, March 16th (Report from this newspaper) - The broad masses of farmers in Sichuan are doing everything possible to prevent wheat lodging.

This year, the 23 million mu of wheat planted in Sichuan is growing particularly well and has generally entered the booting and heading stages. Due to inadequate field management in the previous period, specifically failing to rationally apply fertilizer, some wheat seedlings have experienced excessive growth, with tall stalks and abundant leaves, forming a top-heavy structure that is prone to lodging in windy or rainy conditions. Currently, various preventative measures are being implemented according to local conditions. The more common methods include: (1) Earthing up and hilling to strengthen the roots. (2) Inserting tree branches in the fields to provide support for the wheat seedlings. (3) Pruning wheat leaves to reduce the weight on the upper part of the seedlings and increase ventilation and light penetration. (4) Applying various stalk-strengthening fertilizers and controlling the application of nitrogen fertilizer. (5) In some high-yield "satellite fields," bamboo frames are erected, or windbreaks are set up in wind-prone areas of the wheat fields. (6) Shaking off dew and raindrops from the leaves with bamboo poles on sunny mornings or after rain.

In order to do a good job in preventing lodging and to carry the large-scale high-yield movement through to the end, Party committees at all levels are actively leading the masses to launch short-term, intensive campaigns. The Mianyang, Wenjiang, Neijiang, Nanchong and other regional Party committees have all issued instructions to prevent wheat lodging and strengthen late-stage management. Many communes have formed temporary anti-lodging inspection teams. The Chengjiao District of Santai County organized a 6,700-strong anti-lodging army, and through measures such as applying ash, erecting frames, and shaking off dew, more than 1,500 mu of wheat that was previously likely to lodge has recovered to normal and is out of danger.

At the same time, all localities have also promptly organized manpower to support and straighten individual wheat fields that have already lodged.

    千方百计防治小麦倒伏
    四川部分倒伏小麦经过抢救恢复正常
    本报成都16日电　四川广大农民，千方百计防治小麦倒伏。
    四川省今年种植的二千三百万亩小麦，长得特别好，已普遍进入孕穗、抽穗阶段。由于前一个时期田间管理没有作好合理施肥，部分麦苗发生陡长现象，秆高叶多，形成上重下轻，一遇风雨，就有倒伏危险。目前，各地正在因地制宜地进行多种多样的防止倒伏工作。较普遍的办法有：（1）培土壅土固根。（2）在田间插树枝，增加小麦苗稼的依靠物。（3）剪麦叶，以减轻麦苗上部负重，增加通风透光机会。（4）施用各种壮秆肥料，控制氮肥施用。（5）部分高产卫星田，用竹子搭架，或在麦地当风地带设置挡风障碍物。（6）晴天早晨或雨后，用竹竿赶掉叶上的露水、雨珠。
    为了作好防止倒伏工作，把大面积高产运动坚持到底，各地党委都积极领导群众开展了短期突击运动。中共绵阳、温江、内江、南充等地区地委，都发出防止小麦倒伏，加强后期管理的指示。许多公社组成临时防伏检查小组。三台县城郊区组织了六千七百多人的防伏大军，通过施草木灰、搭架子、赶露水等办法，使原来可能倒伏的一千五百多亩小麦恢复正常，脱离危险。
    与此同时，各地对已经倒伏的个别麦田，也及时组织人力，进行扶正工作。　　　　　　　（孙跃冬）（附图片）
