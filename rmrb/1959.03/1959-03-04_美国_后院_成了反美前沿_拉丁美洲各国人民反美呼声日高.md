This newspaper comprehensively reports: Since the Cuban people achieved revolutionary victory and successfully held demonstrations against American intervention, the sentiments of people in many other Latin American countries to safeguard national independence and break away from American control have been greatly inspired, and anti-American voices are rising everywhere. America's "backyard" has become an anti-American "frontier." The demonstration in the Bolivian capital is just a more intense outbreak of the angry sentiments of the people of Latin American countries.
    Peruvian Miners' Strike for Higher Wages Ends in Victory
    Lima News: 13,000 miners of the American-operated "Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation" launched a strike in late last month to oppose the cruel exploitation of American capitalists and demand wage increases. The strike was held under the leadership of the La Oroya Metal Workers' Union. The Metal Workers' Union demanded a 50% wage increase from the American capital, and after several negotiations, finally accepted the government's proposal and the American capital increased wages by 22%, successfully ending the 14-day struggle.
    Colombian People Launch Struggle Against American Economic Plunder
    Bogota News: The Colombian people have launched a widespread struggle against rising living costs and to fight for their right to survive. In order to get rid of American plunder, demonstrators universally demanded the nationalization of oil and the expansion of foreign trade.
    According to reports, for a month, demonstrations and marches involving more than 10,000 people have been held continuously in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, to oppose rising living costs and demand that the government abolish the decision to increase transportation costs by 70%. In Cartagena, Colombia's main meat-producing area, mass demonstrations also broke out last month against rising meat prices and other living costs. Demonstrators attacked warehouses storing meat and threw stones at the residences, shops, and banks of the "All America Cables and Radio, Inc." managers. In the struggle to defend their right to survive, workers of the Colombian Petroleum Company, in which American capital accounts for the majority, achieved a 14% wage increase victory in late last month. This struggle greatly encouraged workers in various industries in Colombia.
    The increasing poverty of the Colombian people is a direct result of the insatiable economic plunder by the United States and the discriminatory trade practices against Colombia. Due to the continuous decline in coffee exports, which account for 80% of Colombia's foreign exchange earnings, and the US price suppression of coffee, Colombia has lost US$200 million in less than four years. On the other hand, the United States has raised prices to export necessities to Colombia. According to reports, the goods that Colombia needed to exchange 194 bags of coffee for in 1954 required 384 bags in the first half of 1958. The United States also ships 80% of crude oil from Colombia at prices lower than the world market, while Colombia must purchase American-refined oil at high dollar prices. This cannot but create a serious national fiscal deficit and a sharp rise in various living costs.
    Venezuelan Newspapers Expose Misdeeds of US Military Delegation
    Caracas News: Venezuela's "Popular Forum" newspaper recently published an article exposing the ugly acts of the US military delegation in Venezuela by taking advantage of its special privileges.
    The article pointed out that the US military delegation has always interfered in Venezuela's internal affairs. In 1948, US Army Colonel Adams was condemned by President Gallegos for participating in a military coup that overthrew the democratic government at the time.
    The article continued, what is neglected is that the "noble" officers of the US military delegation also do business to compete with local merchants. The newspaper revealed that US military delegation Lieutenant Colonel Walls is using the right of members of the military delegation to be exempt from customs duties to do business. However, in order to avoid an awkward situation, Lieutenant Colonel Walls wrote to the Venezuelan police station, stating that the clothing he was going to sell was "used." The article said that this is a "preemptive" measure, but a "sincere" confession.
    Haitian Revolutionary Front Leader Accuses United States of Supporting Reactionary Regime
    Havana News: De Ruyva, leader of the Haitian exile organization "Haitian Revolutionary Front" in Cuba, accused the US government of aiding the Haitian Duvalier government. According to reports, he charged on the 1st that the recent US announcement of a US$6 million financial aid to Haiti only "helps temporarily maintain the Duvalier dictatorship." The report said that in Washington, a US State Department spokesman declined to comment on De Ruyva's accusations.
    Recent news from Washington said that in view of the increasing instability of the political situation in Haiti after the overthrow of the dictatorship in Cuba, US State Department officials admitted that the United States has been "concerned for some time" about the situation in Haiti, and the purpose of this financial aid to Haiti is to "strengthen the government in power." The news said that before this, the United States had already given the Haitian government a "emergency aid" and is still considering another "aid" plan.

### 美国“后院”成了反美前沿  拉丁美洲各国人民反美呼声日高

    美国“后院”成了反美前沿
    拉丁美洲各国人民反美呼声日高
    本报综合报道　自从古巴人民取得了革命的胜利并且成功地举行了反对美国干涉的示威运动以来，拉丁美洲其他许多国家人民要求维护民族独立、摆脱美国控制的情绪受到很大的激励，各地反美的呼声日益高涨。美国的“后院”已成了反美的“前沿”。玻利维亚首都的示威不过是拉丁美洲各国人民愤怒情绪的一次较强烈的爆发。要求美国资本家提高工资秘鲁矿工罢工胜利结束
    利马消息：美国在秘鲁经营的“塞罗·德帕斯铜矿公司”一万三千名矿工，为了反对美国资本家的残酷剥削，要求增加工资，在上月下旬展开了罢工的斗争。罢工是在拉罢亚地方五金工人联合会领导下举行的。五金工会联合会向美国资方提出增加工资50％的要求，经过多次谈判，最后接受了政府的建议，由美国资方增加工资22％，胜利结束了历时十四天的斗争。反对美国经济掠夺哥伦比亚人民展开斗争
    波哥大消息：哥伦比亚人民为反对生活费用上涨和争取生存权利而展开广泛的斗争。为摆脱美国的掠夺，示威群众普遍要求石油国有化和扩大对外贸易。
    据报道，一个月以来，在哥伦比亚首都波哥大连续举行了有一万多人参加的示威游行，反对生活费用上涨和要求政府取消增加交通费70％的决定。在哥伦比亚主要产肉地区哈他亨那港，上月份也爆发了反对肉价和其他生活费用上涨的群众示威。示威者曾经袭击贮藏肉类的仓库，并向“全美电报公司”经理的住所、商店和银行投掷石子。在保卫生存权利的斗争中，美国资本占绝大部分的哥伦比亚石油公司的工人已经在上月下旬取得了增加工资14％的胜利，这一斗争大大鼓舞了哥伦比亚各个行业的工人。
    哥伦比亚人民生活的日益贫困，是美国贪得无厌的经济掠夺和对哥伦比亚实行贸易歧视的直接结果。由于占哥伦比亚外汇来源80％的咖啡出口不断减少和美国对咖啡实行压价，已经使哥伦比亚在不到四年内损失了两亿美元。另一方面，美国却提高价格向哥伦比亚输出生活必需品。据报道，哥伦比亚在1954年需用一百九十四袋咖啡来换取的货物，在1958年上半年就要用三百八十四袋。美国还用低于世界市场的价格从哥伦比亚运走80％的原油，而哥伦比亚却必须用高昂的美元价格来购进美国提炼的石油。这不能不造成国家财政的严重赤字和各种生活费用的急剧上涨。美军事代表团为非作歹委内瑞拉报纸痛予揭露加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉“人民论坛报”不久前发表文章，揭露美国军事代表团利用其特殊权利在委内瑞拉为非作歹的丑行。
    文章指出，美国军事代表团过去一直干涉委内瑞拉内政。1948年美国阿丹姆斯陆军上校就因参与推翻当时民主政府的军事政变而受到加莱哥斯总统谴责。
    文章接着说，为人忽视的事是美国军事代表团“高贵”的军官们还兼做买卖来同当地的商人竞争。报纸揭露说，美国军事代表团的华尔斯中校就在利用军事代表团成员免纳关税的权利来作买卖。但是为了避免碰到下不了台的局面，华尔斯中校却给委内瑞拉警察局写信，声明他将要出售的衣物是“用过的”。文章说，这是一种“先发制人”的手段，但却是“诚恳的”招供。海地革命阵线领导人指责美国支持反动政权
    哈瓦那消息：在古巴的海地流亡者组织“海地革命阵线”领导人德儒瓦指责美国政府援助海地杜瓦利埃政府。据报道，他在1日指责说，美国最近宣布给予海地六百万美元的财政援助只是“有助于暂时维持杜瓦利埃独裁政权”。消息说，在华盛顿，美国国务院发言人拒绝就德儒瓦的上述指责发表意见。
    最近从华盛顿来的消息说，鉴于在古巴推翻独裁政权后海地政局的日益不稳，美国国务院官员承认，美国对海地局势的“关心已经有一个时候了”，而这次给予海地财政援助的目的是“加强当权的政府”。消息说，在这之前，美国已经给予海地政府一笔“紧急援助”，并且还在考虑另一项“援助”计划。
