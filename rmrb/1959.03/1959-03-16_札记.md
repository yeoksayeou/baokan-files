    Notes
    "Benevolent" Enemy
    American Consul to Tanganyika, Dagan, recently slandered Africans as "children who want to walk but cannot," saying that "if Africans want to gain independence quickly... they are likely to fall into weakness and instability"; at the same time, he openly praised "benevolent colonialism."
    If Africans were truly as "weak" as this consul said, then he wouldn't need to worry about the African struggle for rapid independence. The opposite is true; as the "Washington Post" admits, "the volcano of Africa" is erupting everywhere, shaking the foundations of colonialism. Therefore, what is truly "falling into weakness and instability" is not the African struggle, nor their prospects after gaining independence, but the current situation of these jackal-like colonial overlords.
    Dagan slandered Africans at this time precisely to save colonialism. When he praised "benevolent colonialism," he completely exposed this. But in doing so, Africans can clearly see that their enemies are not only the "benevolent colonialists" like Britain and France, but also the more vicious Washington bosses who praise "benevolent colonialism."
    Evasive Talk
    On March 9, the Director-General of Japan's "Defense Agency," Munenori Akagi, when answering questions in the Diet, defended the Kishi Nobusuke government's nuclear armament policy, saying that even if missiles like "Honest John" were equipped with nuclear weapons, it would not violate the constitution. Because, according to him, these missiles have a range of only about forty kilometers and are "defensive" rather than offensive weapons.
    On the same day, Kishi Nobusuke also sophistically argued: "If purely nuclear weapons that replace current rifles appear, I don't think the constitution prohibits such things." What clumsy evasive talk this is! It seems that Kishi Nobusuke and Akagi are geniuses and the sole authoritative appraisers, while the Japanese people are all fools. As long as the appraisers describe nuclear weapons as "defensive" weapons "replacing rifles," then the Japanese people will allow the Kishi Nobusuke group to carry out nuclear armament and push Japan to the brink of American nuclear war adventures. However, the sinister militarist nuclear armament plan cannot escape the discerning eyes of the people.

    札记
    “仁慈”的敌人
    美国驻坦噶尼喀领事达根最近一面诬蔑非洲人“是一个想走路而又不能走的孩子”，说什么“如果非洲人想迅速地获得独立，……就很可能陷于虚弱和不稳定状态”；一面则公然赞扬“仁慈的殖民主义”。
    如果非洲人真是像这位领事所说的那样“虚弱”，那就根本用不着他担心非洲人争取迅速取得独立的斗争。事实恰恰相反，“华盛顿邮报”承认，“非洲的火山”到处在喷出火焰，震撼着殖民主义的统治。因此，真正“陷于虚弱和不稳定”的不是非洲人的斗争，更不是他们取得独立后的前景，而是这批豺狼般的殖民主义老爷们现在的处境。
    达根所以要在这时候对非洲人进行诬蔑，正是为了挽救殖民主义。当他赞扬“仁慈的殖民主义”的时候，就彻底地暴露了这一点。但这样一来，非洲人可以清楚地看到，他们的敌人不仅是英法等“仁慈的殖民主义”，还有更凶恶的赞扬“仁慈的殖民主义”的华盛顿老爷们。
    油腔滑调
    3月9日，日本的“防卫厅”长官伊能繁次郎，在国会答复质询时，替岸信介政府的核武装政策辩解说：像“诚实的约翰”这种导弹，即使装上核武器，也不违反宪法。因为，据他说，这种导弹的射程只有四十公里左右，是“防卫的”而不是攻击的武器。
    同一天，岸信介也曾诡辩说：“如果出现了纯粹是代替现在的步枪的核武器，我想宪法并没有禁止这种东西。”这是多么拙劣的油腔滑调。似乎岸信介和伊能之流是天才而唯一权威的鉴定家，而日本人民则都是傻瓜，只要鉴定家们把核武器说成是“代替步枪”的“防卫的”，那末，日本人民就会听任岸信介集团进行核武装，把日本推向美国核战争冒险的边缘。但是，阴森森的军国主义核武装计划，是逃不掉人民雪亮的眼睛的。
