Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 6th: Soviet Premier Khrushchev, at a luncheon held in Leipzig City Hall on the 5th, reiterated the Soviet Union's position on the German question and the West Berlin question. He said: Our proposals are conducive to the cause of peace and aim to achieve and strengthen peace. He also said: If the activists of the Western world want to intimidate us with war, then let them be aware that we have already experienced such intimidation, and we cannot be intimidated.

Referring to the Soviet Union's transfer of the authority to inspect Western countries' military transport from West Berlin to West Germany to the German Democratic Republic, Khrushchev said, we have been saying to the leaders of Western countries, and we continue to say, that if you are willing to negotiate with us rationally, we can change the date of May 27th, for example, to June 27th. If you wish, we can also change it to July, but the West Berlin issue must be resolved, and the German peace treaty issue must be resolved.

Khrushchev said: "As for the Berlin issue, we hope it will not be resolved partially, and not be resolved separately from the entire German question. With the signing of a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, the West Berlin issue will also be resolved. We will fulfill the functions we have undertaken under the Potsdam Agreement and other agreements on Berlin, until a peace treaty is signed with the two existing Germanies, or one of them."

Khrushchev said that people of all countries want peace, so it is necessary to find ways to resolve disputes peacefully to stop new wars from happening. Developing trade helps to enhance mutual understanding and establish friendly relations between countries. He pointed out that it is good to hold meetings and conferences at industrial exhibitions and trade fairs. Agreements can be reached more quickly at such meetings.

Khrushchev said, I came here not to argue about ideological issues. I am here representing the business community of the Soviet Union. He then said, we have repeatedly said in the past and now, that we advocate the principle of peaceful coexistence. However, not everyone recognizes this proposition. Some people in the West do not want peaceful coexistence. What does it mean to not recognize peaceful coexistence? Those who do not recognize peaceful coexistence will drown, because they have no other way out. Khrushchev warned these people: "Don't touch us with your arms, if you dare to do so, then you will break your arms."

Khrushchev said that in order to guarantee peace, it is necessary to eliminate the consequences of the long-ended Second World War. It has been almost fourteen years since the end of the Second World War, and a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been signed. All those who advocate maintaining and strengthening peace should advocate eliminating the consequences of the war and oppose those who obstruct the signing of a peace treaty with Germany.

Khrushchev also said that we advocate the reunification of Germany. Let Mr. Adenauer and Comrade Grotewohl meet and reach an agreement on this point. We will vote in favor of the agreement they reach.

At this point, Ulbricht interjected, Adenauer is afraid of such a meeting.

Khrushchev continued, Comrade Ulbricht has made a very correct and meaningful point. Adenauer's attitude shows that the Federal Chancellor is discouraged. If the Federal Chancellor feels that he has strength, then he need not be afraid of establishing a confederation as suggested by the leaders of the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev pointed out that the ruling group of the Federal Republic of Germany is unwilling to establish a confederation and is afraid of a confederation, which clearly means how decadent capitalism is, and it does not have enough life-sustaining juice to "digest" the German Democratic Republic. We believe that the working class, laboring peasants, and all the working people of the German Democratic Republic will not be deceived and will not give up their achievements.

Khrushchev said that some people in the Western world say that they cannot negotiate with us at all on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of West Berlin, saying that this will become a new Munich. Khrushchev pointed out: "I see that there are also British gentlemen present here, and I want to say to you directly that a peace treaty will be signed eventually! If the Western countries do not agree to sign a peace treaty with the two existing Germanies, then we will sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. Other countries that fought against Hitler will probably also sign this peace treaty."

Khrushchev said that after a peace treaty is signed with the two Germanies or with the German Democratic Republic, all existing occupation provisions concerning Berlin will cease to be effective. The government of the German Democratic Republic will then exercise full sovereignty over its territory. He added: Whoever verbally advocates peace but in action tries to maintain the state of the Second World War, then let him consider his actions or go see a doctor.

Khrushchev said that concluding a peace treaty with Germany is conducive to the cause of peace. But some groups in the West are threatening us. They want to maintain a state of war and apparently want to force us to fight. In this case, we have no choice. Whether a peace treaty with Germany is signed or not, these people always want to wage war. And by canceling the state of war with Germany, we will make a significant contribution to preventing a new war.

### 赫鲁晓夫重申苏联在德国问题上的态度  对德和约必须签订　西柏林问题必须解决  如果西方愿意谈判，苏联可以更改移交柏林管辖权的期限

    赫鲁晓夫重申苏联在德国问题上的态度
    对德和约必须签订　西柏林问题必须解决
    如果西方愿意谈判，苏联可以更改移交柏林管辖权的期限
    新华社来比锡6日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5日在来比锡市政大厅举行的午宴上重申苏联在德国问题和西柏林问题上的立场。他说：我们的建议有助于和平事业，目的是取得和加强和平。他又说：如果西方世界的活动家想用战争来恐吓我们，那么，请他们注意，我们已领略过这种恐吓，我们不可能被吓倒。
    在谈到苏联将把对西方三国从西柏林到西德的军事运输的检查职权移交给德意志民主共和国时，赫鲁晓夫说，我们过去和现在都一直在对西方国家的领导人说，如果你们愿意理智地跟我们谈判，我们可以把5月27日改期，譬如改到6月27日。如果你们愿意，我们也可以改到7月，但是西柏林问题必须解决，对德和约问题必须解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“至于柏林问题，我们希望不是局部地解决，不是把它同整个德国问题分开来加以解决。随着同德意志民主共和国签订和约，西柏林问题也将得到解决。我们将履行我们根据波茨坦协定和关于柏林的其他协定所承担的职能，一直到同两个现有德国或其中的一个签订和约为止。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民都希望和平，因此必须寻找和平解决争端的方法，以制止新战争发生。发展贸易有助于增进互相谅解，建立国与国之间的友好关系。他指出，在工业展览会上，在博览会上举行会晤和会议是很好的。在这种会晤上可以更快地达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我到这里来不是为了在意识形态的问题上吵架。我是代表苏联的实业界来的。他接着说，我们过去和现在都一再说过，我们主张实现和平共处的原则。但是，并不是所有的人都承认这种主张。西方某些人不想和平共处。不承认和平共处意味着什么呢？不承认和平共处的人会淹死的，因为他们没有别的出路。赫鲁晓夫警告这些人说：“你们别拿胳膊来碰我们，如果敢这样做的话，那么你们会把胳膊折断的。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，为了保障和平，必须消除早已结束的第二次世界大战的后果。第二次世界大战结束快十四年了，而对德和约还没有签订。所有主张维护和加强和平的人应当主张消除战争后果，反对阻挠签订对德和约的人。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，我们主张恢复德国统一。让阿登纳先生和格罗提渥同志会晤，并就这一点达成协议吧。我们将投票赞成他们所达成的协议。
    讲到这里的时候，乌布利希插话说，阿登纳害怕这种会晤。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，乌布利希同志说出了非常正确和有意义的意见。阿登纳的态度表明，联邦总理气馁。如果联邦总理先生觉得自己有力量的话，那就不必害怕像德意志民主共和国领导人所建议那样来建立邦联。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，德意志联邦共和国的统治集团不愿意建立邦联，害怕邦联，这显然意味着资本主义是多么腐朽，它已经没有足够的维持生命的汁液来进行“消化”德意志民主共和国了。我们相信，德意志民主共和国的工人阶级、劳动农民和所有的劳动人民不会受骗的，不会把自己的成果让出去的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方世界的某些人士说，他们根本不能就缔结对德和约问题和西柏林问题同我们谈判，说这将会变成新的慕尼黑。赫鲁晓夫指出：“我发现这里也有英国先生在场，我想直截了当地对你们说，和约总归要签订的！如果西方国家不同意跟两个实际存在的德国签订和约，那么我们就同德意志民主共和国签订和约。曾经同希特勒作过战的别的国家大概也会签订这个和约的。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，同两个德国或同德意志民主共和国签订和约后，一切有关柏林的现行的占领条款都将停止生效。德意志民主共和国政府那时将在自己的领土上实行全部主权。他又补充说：谁在口头上主张和平而在行动上力图保持第二次世界大战的状态，那就请他考虑一下自己的行动或者去瞧瞧医生。
    赫鲁晓夫说，缔结对德和约有助于和平事业。但是西方某些集团在威胁我们。他们想保持战争状态，显然想强迫我们打仗。在这种情况下，我们就没有选择余地了。不管对德和约是否签订，这些人总是想搞战争的。而取消了对德战争状态我们就是对防止新战争作出了重大的贡献。
