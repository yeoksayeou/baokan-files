Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th - The British people are lodging protests with the Colonial Secretary, severely condemning Britain's brutal massacre of Africans in Nyasaland.

    The London office of the "Africa Organization Committee" today demanded that Britain provide evidence of the so-called "plot to massacre Europeans" in Nyasaland, a pretext used by the British Colonial Secretary in his speech in the House of Commons to justify the armed suppression of Africans by the British colonial authorities. Bashirun, chairman of the organization, issued a statement saying that the British colonial authorities' barbaric massacre of twenty-nine Africans and imprisonment of one hundred and fifty African leaders was because they feared the Nyasaland people's legitimate demands for autonomy.

    Newbold, secretary of the Lancashire Trades Councils Federation, which has 500,000 members, said in a letter of protest that the use of force to deal with the Nyasaland people's desire for independence was likely to create a second Kenya.

    Wright, district secretary of the Stockport Mixed Mechanical Engineering Union, said that attempts to stop the rising tide of African nationalism by means of suppression were futile. He pointed out that this was "an indication of the increasing tendency of white immigrants throughout Africa towards fascism."

    The Kirkcaldy Presbyterian Church telegraphed the Colonial Secretary saying that missionaries unanimously support the desire of black Nyasalanders not to join the Federation.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd - The British government's policy of armed suppression of the people of Nyasaland was opposed in the House of Commons today.

    Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd openly expressed his full agreement in a speech in the House of Commons today with the actions taken by the Governor of Nyasaland in declaring a state of emergency and requesting the dispatch of troops to carry out armed suppression.

    When he announced the arrest of the leaders of the African National Congress, cries of "Shame!" were heard in the House of Commons.

    Labor MP Fenner Brockway accused the government of conspiring with the Prime Ministers of the Central African Federation and Southern Rhodesia to "have it out" with the African people.

    Labor MP Mrs. Eirene White pointed out that sending troops from Southern Rhodesia to Nyasaland was the most provocative thing to do and would make the situation seriously uncontrollable.

    Labor MPs were also dissatisfied with the expulsion of Labor MP John Stonehouse from Northern Rhodesia by the colonial authorities. Stonehouse was visiting at the time, and he had made speeches exposing the brutal rule of the white rulers there, and was therefore expelled by the colonial authorities.

    不许屠杀尼亚萨兰人民！
    英国公众抗议政府的暴行
    新华社伦敦4日电　英国人民纷纷向殖民大臣提出抗议，严厉谴责英国在尼亚萨兰屠杀非洲人的残暴行为。
    “非洲组织委员会”伦敦办事处今天要求英国提出所谓尼亚萨兰境内“屠杀欧洲人的阴谋”的证据，这是英国殖民地大臣在下院发言时用来企图为英殖民当局武装镇压非洲人进行辩解的借口。这个组织的主席巴舒龙发表声明说，英殖民当局野蛮地屠杀二十九个非洲人和监禁一百五十位非洲领袖，是因为它害怕尼亚萨兰人民争取自治权的正当要求。
    拥有五十万会员的兰开夏工会理事会联合会书记纽博耳德在抗议书中说，使用武力来对付尼亚萨兰人民争取独立的愿望的这种做法，很可能造成第二个怯尼亚。
    斯托克波尔特混合机械工业工会地区书记赖特说，企图用镇压手段来制止日益高涨的非洲民族主义浪潮，这是徒劳的。他指出，这是“整个非洲的白种移民日益倾向法西斯的一种迹象”。
    寇科耳迪长老会致电殖民地大臣说，传教士一致支持尼亚萨兰黑种人不愿参加联邦的愿望。
    新华社伦敦3日电　英国政府对尼亚萨兰人民进行武装镇压的政策今天在下院遭到了反对。
    殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德今天在下院发表的一篇谈话中公然表示完全同意尼亚萨兰总督所采取的宣布紧急状态并且请求派兵去进行武装镇压的行动。
    当他宣布逮捕了非洲人国民大会的领导人的消息时，下院中发出了叫喊声：“可耻！”
    工党议员芬纳·布罗克威指责政府同中非联邦和南罗得西亚总理合谋向非洲人民“摊牌”。
    工党议员艾伦·怀特夫人指出，从南罗得西亚向尼亚萨兰派去军队是最富挑衅性的事情，这将使局势严重得无法控制。
    工党议员们对于工党议员约翰·斯通豪斯在北罗得西亚被殖民当局驱逐出境一事也感到不满。斯通豪斯当时正在进行访问，他发表了一些揭露那里的白种统治者的野蛮统治的演说，因而遭到殖民当局的驱逐。
