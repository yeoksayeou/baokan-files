    This Sentence is Worth Discussing
    In Zhong Huai's "Untitled Thoughts" on the eighth page of the February 17th People's Daily, there are two miscellaneous feelings. The second is about the problem of "cold" and "hot". The last sentence is like this: "When someone emphasizes being hot to you, please investigate whether he himself has been hot in the past, and whether he still has enthusiasm now." I think this sentence is worth discussing. Because even if a person has not been "hot" in the past, it is not a bad thing to persuade others to be more enthusiastic now, and it is worth welcoming.
              Heizi
    Thank you to Comrade Heizi for the suggestion. The original sentence was like this: "When someone emphasizes being cold to you...", the word "cold" was mistakenly printed as "hot".

    这句话值得商讨
    2月17日人民日报第八版上锺怀写的“无题有感”，有两则杂感。第二则是谈“冷”与“热”的问题，最后一句是这样：“当有人向你强调要热的时候，请考察一下他自己过去是不是热过，现在还有没有热气。”这一句我觉得值得商讨。因为即使是一个过去没有“热”过的人，现在劝人家要热情一些，也不是坏事，也值得欢迎。

    感谢黑子同志提出的意见。那句话原来是这样：“当有人向你强调要冷的时候……”，“冷”字误排成“热”了。
