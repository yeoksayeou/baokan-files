Facing the Whole Country, Facing the Entirety, Facing the Key Points
Benxi Iron and Steel Exceeds Pig Iron Transfer Plan; Sichuan Rushes Pig Iron Transport with Thousands of Vehicles and Boats

(Our Dispatch) Benxi Iron and Steel Company actively implements the state-stipulated pig iron transfer plan to support key enterprises. In January and February this year, it supported more than 20 major systems nationwide with over 272,000 tons of pig iron, exceeding the external transfer plan by 6.5%, ensuring the production needs of more than 500 units under ten major systems, including the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Railways.

Benxi Iron and Steel Company has grown stronger with the support of fraternal units across the country. From its own production and construction process, they deeply understand the importance of mutual support. Therefore, for several years, they have always regarded supporting the whole country as an important task. After the Party put forward the policy of "the whole country as a single chessboard" this year, the company's Party committee attached even greater importance to this work. It specifically convened a Party committee meeting to study the production and national needs situation, arranged the pig iron delivery sequence according to the spirit of the central instructions, and designated a deputy manager to specifically oversee the pig iron shipment situation. In completing the task of transferring pig iron externally, they promptly and vigorously solved problems as soon as they were discovered. They also actively created various favorable conditions to ensure the completion of the plan according to variety, even if it meant delaying some of their own work to complete the task of supporting external units. In January and February, they transferred 10,000 tons of pig iron from their own use to fraternal units.

Recently, in order to ensure the supply of materials for the country's metallurgical equipment manufacturing, the company's leadership immediately instructed the iron smelting plant to produce foundry iron. Smelting foundry iron requires higher temperatures in the blast furnace, which brings many new technical problems. However, the Party committee resolutely demanded that all departments guarantee its realization, and convened meetings of the mining, coking, mechanical repair, power and transportation departments to study and take measures to ensure the completion of the foundry iron task. In order to increase the supply of foundry iron, it was recently decided that all blast furnaces would be converted to smelting foundry iron. Due to the importance attached by the Party committee, all factories and mines are also doing everything possible to ensure the completion of tasks according to the ordered varieties. In order to meet the needs of blast furnaces smelting foundry iron, the coking plant is vigorously improving the quality of coke to increase coke strength. The mechanical repair department has also strengthened the maintenance of blast furnaces and prepared more spare parts. The first batch of 40,000 tons of foundry iron has already been shipped ahead of schedule.

In order to deliver pig iron to key enterprises faster, the company's transportation department and the railway department launched a high-yield week campaign and took measures to accelerate vehicle turnover.

(Our Dispatch) In order to cooperate with the high-yield and high-quality competition movement for steel, iron, and coal coke, and to ensure that key enterprises complete and overfulfill the state plan for the first quarter, a mass movement of surging momentum to rush and transport pig iron, coal coke, and short-distance materials is unfolding in various parts of Sichuan.

Since January and February this year, due to the all-round leap forward in steel, coal, grain, and cotton in Sichuan Province, especially the high-yield and high-quality movement for steel, iron, and coal coke launched in February, the volume of material transport has increased sharply, breaking the balance of short-distance transportation. At present, the backlog of short-distance materials in various parts of the province has reached 700,000 tons, while trains, automobiles, and ships on trunk lines are underutilized, forming an abnormal phenomenon of loose trunk lines and tight branch lines. In order to solve this new contradiction and promote the further development of the new upsurge of industrial and agricultural production currently sweeping the province, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and local and municipal committees have recently held a series of telephone conferences, focusing on the weak link of short-distance transportation and taking a series of measures. First, the province has increased 100,000 laborers to transfer pig iron, ensuring that at least 3,500 tons of transfer tasks are completed every day. Second, improve short-distance transportation conditions, fully mobilize and rely on the masses, make great efforts in technical revolution, realize the vehicularization, track-laying, chute-ization, and ball-bearing-ization of transportation, as well as the mechanization and semi-mechanization of handling and loading and unloading, to improve transportation efficiency. In particular, in areas with relatively fixed materials and large transportation volumes, vigorously develop wooden rail transportation; at the same time, fully utilize and give play to the strength of folk transportation, which is the main force of short-distance transportation. Third, people's communes establish permanent professional transportation teams to undertake short-distance transportation within and outside the commune. All short-distance transportation and loading and unloading work is undertaken by the commune transportation team. At the same time, all factories, mines, and furnace clusters also establish their own professional transportation teams to undertake short-distance transportation inside and outside the factories and mines. Fourth, immediately develop alcohol production to solve the transportation fuel problem; and make every effort to save fuel.

After taking these measures, thousands of vehicles and boats were dispatched from various places, and the volume of pig iron, coal coke, and other materials increased rapidly. Starting from the 21st, the dispatch of pig iron from various places in the province surged to 4,000 tons, an increase of 32% compared with the average daily dispatch volume in the first half of February.

    面向全国  面向整体面向重点
    本钢超额完成生铁调运计划  四川千车万船突击运送生铁
    本报讯　本溪钢铁公司积极执行国家规定的外调生铁计划，支援重点企业。今年1、2月份向全国二十多个大系统支援生铁二十七万二千多吨，超过外调计划6.5％，保证了冶金工业部、第一机械工业部、铁道部等十个大系统所属五百多个单位的生产需要。
    本溪钢铁公司是在全国兄弟单位支援下成长壮大的。从自己生产建设过程中，他们深刻体会到互相支援的重要性，因此几年来他们一直把支援全国作为重要任务，今年党提出全国一盘棋的方针后，公司党委更重视了这一工作，曾专门召开党委会研究生产和国家需要情况，根据中央指示精神安排了生铁发货顺序，并且指定了一名副经理专门掌握生铁发运情况。在完成外调生铁任务当中，一发现问题，就及时努力解决。并且积极创造各种有利条件，保证按品种完成计划，甚至宁可延缓自己的一部分工作，也要完成支援外单位的任务，1、2月份从自用生铁中调给各兄弟单位的就有一万吨。
    最近，为了保证国家制造冶金设备用料，这个公司领导方面立即责成炼铁厂生产铸造铁。炼铸造铁要求高炉有更高的温度，给技术上带来了不少新的问题，但是党委坚决要求各部门保证实现，并召集矿山、炼焦、机械修配、动力运输等部门开会，研究采取措施保证完成铸造铁任务。为了增加铸造铁的供应量，最近又确定全部高炉都改炼铸造铁。由于党委重视，各厂矿也都千方百计保证按订货品种完成任务。炼焦厂为了满足高炉炼铸造铁的需要，大力提高焦炭质量，以提高焦炭强度。机械修配部门也加强了高炉的维护，准备了更多的备品备件。现在第一批四万吨铸造铁的任务已经提前发送完。
    为了把生铁更快地送到重点企业，这个公司的运输部和铁路部门开展了高产周运动，采取措施加速车辆周转。
    本报讯　为了配合钢、铁、煤焦的高产高质竞赛运动，保证重点企业完成和超额完成第一季度国家计划，一个声势浩大的群众性的突击抢运生铁煤焦和短途物资的群众运动，正在四川各地展开。
    今年1、2月以来，四川省由于钢、煤、粮、棉全面跃进，特别是2月份开展了钢、铁、煤焦的高产高质运动，物资运量急剧增大，突破了短途运输的平衡。目前，全省各地短途积压物资已达七十万吨，而干线运输的火车、汽车、轮船等却吃不饱，形成干线松、支线紧的反常现象。为了解决这一新的矛盾，推动当前全省掀起的工农业生产新高潮的进一步发展，中共四川省委和各地、市委最近连续召开电话会议，针对短途运输这一薄弱环节，采取了一系列的措施。首先，全省增加十万劳动力调运生铁，保证每天至少完成三千五百吨的调运任务。第二，改善短途运输条件，充分发动、依靠群众，大闹技术革命，实现运输车子化、轨道化、梭槽化、滚珠轴承化以及搬运装卸的机械化、半机械化，以提高运效。特别是物资较固定、运量较大的地区，大力发展木轨运输；同时，充分运用，发挥民间运输力量，这是短途运输的主力。第三，人民公社建立经常性的专业运输队伍，担负社内社外的短途运输。凡是短途运输和装卸工作，都由公社运输队担负。同时，各厂矿、炉群，也建立自己的专业运输队伍，担负厂矿内外的短途运输。第四，立即发展酒精生产解决运输燃料问题；并尽一切努力节约燃料。
    采取这些措施后，各地千车万船出动，生铁、煤焦等的运量急速增长。21日开始，全省各地发运生铁猛增到四千吨，比2月份上半月每日平均发运量增长32％。（附图片）
