Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions on the army's engagement in industrial and agricultural production, requiring all officers and soldiers to dedicate no more than two months each year to industrial and agricultural production. Through productive labor, the aim is to further enhance the communist consciousness and scientific and technological level of the troops, transform all officers and soldiers into revolutionary soldiers who possess both combat and production skills, and increase the nation's material wealth, reducing the state's burden of supplying the army.

The instructions stipulate that, apart from units with technical equipment, the army's production should generally focus on agricultural and sideline production. Among agricultural and sideline production activities, vegetable cultivation and pig raising should be prioritized to gradually achieve complete or substantial self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables. The instructions call for the entire army to make full use of land near barracks, utilizing early mornings, evenings, or spare time between study and operations, to plant vegetables, oil crops, and feed crops, raise a large number of pigs, and, where conditions permit, also raise fish and various livestock and poultry, cultivate fruit trees, and gradually implement the landscaping of barracks. If land near barracks is scarce, small farms may also be established at suitable locations. Units at or above the regimental level can also establish flour mills, sauce-making workshops, and bean product processing workshops.

In terms of industrial production, the instructions require that all units in the army with technical equipment, under the absolute premise of ensuring the completion of military production tasks and teaching tasks, should, to the best of their ability, accept some processing orders from local areas, repair and manufacture some civilian products. The instructions also clearly stipulate the principles for the army's engagement in industrial production and the handling of industrial production profits and agricultural and sideline production income.

The instructions conclude by requiring Party committees and relevant departments at all levels of the army to strengthen leadership and management of industrial and agricultural production, strengthen political and ideological work among production personnel, and ensure that each production unit can both complete its production tasks and become a model for implementing the Party's policies.

Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: A movement for agricultural and sideline production, with vegetable cultivation and pig raising as its main projects, is being widely launched in various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The broad masses of officers and soldiers are seizing the gaps in the early mornings and evenings to actively engage in activities such as accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, deep plowing the land, and various preparatory activities for plowing. Troops stationed in areas with warm springs have already begun sowing and raising seedlings.

According to the General Political Department's instructions on the army's engagement in industrial and agricultural production, all units have specifically formulated this year's production leap forward plans, striving to achieve complete or substantial self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and other non-staple foods ahead of schedule. This year, a certain naval unit plans to produce two million catties of vegetables, three to four hundred thousand catties of grain crops, raise two thousand pigs, five hundred sheep, and two thousand five hundred chickens and ducks, and achieve complete self-sufficiency in meat and non-staple foods within this year. The air force Party committee's plan requires that this year stations, troops, schools, warehouses, hospitals, sanatoriums, and other units with better production conditions and foundations should achieve nine months of self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat, striving for complete self-sufficiency throughout the year. This year, the Shanghai Garrison District troops are adopting nine types of cultivation (planting vegetables, oil crops, melons, potatoes, fruits, mushrooms, kelp, hemp, medicinal materials) and nine types of raising (raising pigs, cattle, sheep, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, bees), and have opened sixty self-produced and self-sold sauce gardens, oil presses, tofu workshops, and other workshops. Under the leap forward goal of "thousands of hairy pigs, ten thousand chickens and ducks, one hundred thousand fish, and one million catties of vegetables," a certain PLA unit stationed in Zhejiang strives to basically achieve complete self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods this year.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers in various units are full of energy in industrial and agricultural production. The officers and soldiers have adopted six methods such as sweeping, digging, picking up, composting, smoking, and creating to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. By late February, the officers and soldiers in the Nanjing area had accumulated more than 94.85 million catties of fertilizer. By mid-February, the officers and soldiers in the Beijing area had accumulated more than 100 million catties of fertilizer. The officers and soldiers in various units have also widely launched activities such as building water conservancy projects, deep plowing the land, repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools, carefully selecting seeds, expanding pig farms for breeding piglets, and building fish ponds. Many troops have deep plowed the land to a depth of one foot or one and a half feet.

At present, many troops have begun to raise seedlings and sow seeds. A certain naval unit has selected eighteen kinds of vegetable seeds and is raising seedlings in greenhouses. By the end of February, the troops in the Zhejiang area had not only completed the sowing task on two-thirds of the land, but had also harvested more than 300,000 catties of various vegetables.

    为国家增加物质财富　逐步实现肉类蔬菜自给
    解放军大力开展工农业生产
    新华社13日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出关于军队进行工农业生产的指示，要求全军官兵每年一般以不超过两个月的时间从事工农业生产。通过生产劳动，进一步提高部队人员的共产主义觉悟和科学技术水平，使全军官兵成为既有战斗技能又有生产技能的革命军人，并且为国家增加物质财富，减少国家对军队的供应。
    指示中规定，军队进行生产，除有技术设备的单位外，一般应以农副业生产为主。在农副业生产中，又应把种菜、养猪做为主要项目，逐步实现肉类、蔬菜的全部或大部自给。指示中要求全军尽量利用营区附近的土地，利用早晚或学习、操作的空余时间，种植蔬菜、油料和饲料作物，大量养猪，有条件的地方还可养鱼和饲养各种家畜家禽，栽培果木，逐步实行营区园林化。如营区附近土地缺少，亦可选择适当地点举办小型农场。团以上单位还可以开办制粉、造酱、豆类加工作坊。
    在工业生产方面，指示中要求部队中一切具有技术设备的单位，在绝对保证完成军事生产任务和教学任务的前提下，都应当按照可能，以多余的力量，接受地方一部分加工订货、修理制造一部分民用产品的生产。指示中对部队从事工业生产的原则和工业生产利润与农副业生产收入的处理原则，也作了明确的规定。
    指示最后要求部队各级党委和有关部门必须加强对工农业生产的领导和管理，加强生产人员的政治思想工作，务使各生产单位既能完成生产任务，又能成为执行党的政策的模范。
    新华社13日讯　以种菜、养猪为主要项目的农副业生产运动，正在中国人民解放军各部队普遍展开。广大官兵抓紧早晚的空隙时间，积极展开积肥、兴修水利、深翻土地和各项备耕活动，驻在春暖花开地带的部队，已经开始播种和育苗。
    根据总政治部关于军队进行工农业生产的指示，各部队都具体制订了今年的生产跃进规划，力争提前实现菜、肉等副食品全部或大部自给。海军某部今年计划生产蔬菜二百万斤、粮食作物三、四十万斤，养猪二千头、羊五百头、鸡鸭二千五百只，在今年内实现肉类、副食品全部自给。空军党委制定的规划中，要求全军生产条件和基础较好的场站、部队、学校、仓库、医院、疗养院等单位，今年达到蔬菜、肉类自给九个月，争取全年全部自给。上海警备区部队今年采取九种（种蔬菜、油料、瓜、薯、水果、蘑菇、海带、麻、药材）九养（养猪、牛、羊、兔、鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、蜂），并开办了六十个自产自销的酱园、油坊、豆腐坊等作坊。浙江驻军某部在“千头毛猪、万只鸡鸭、十万尾鱼、百万斤蔬菜”的跃进目标下，今年力争要基本上实现主要副食品全部自给。
    各部队广大官兵在工农业生产中干劲十足。官兵们采用扫、挖、拾、沤、熏、造等六种办法，积了大量的肥料。南京地区部队官兵到2月下旬已积肥九千四百八十五万多斤。北京地区部队官兵到2月中旬积肥一亿多斤。各部队官兵还广泛地展开了兴修水利、深翻土地、修理和制造农具、精选种籽、扩建养猪场配殖仔猪、修建养鱼池等工作。许多部队的土地深翻了一尺或一尺半以上。
    目前，许多部队已开始进行育苗和播种。海军某部选择了十八种蔬菜种籽，正在温室中育苗。浙江地区各部队到2月底止，不但有三分之二的土地已经完成播种任务，并且已收获了各种蔬菜三十多万斤。
