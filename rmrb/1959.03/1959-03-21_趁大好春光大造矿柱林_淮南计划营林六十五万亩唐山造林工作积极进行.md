    Xinhua News Agency:
    Taking advantage of the great spring season to vigorously create mine prop forests.
    Huainan plans to afforest 650,000 mu, Tangshan is actively carrying out afforestation work
    (Reported) Huainan Coal Mine, one of China's five major coal mine bases, is adopting a self-reliant approach to vigorously create mine prop forests to ensure the need for timber in the Huainan Coal Mine.
    According to the decision of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Huainan Municipal Committee, all the suburbs of Huainan City, except for some cultivated land used for growing vegetables, will be used to create mine prop forests and plant fruit tree forests and special economic forests; combined with mixed farming in the forest land, it will be ensured that mine props are self-sufficient within five years, with an annual output of 600,000 to 800,000 cubic meters of mine prop timber.
    At present, a massive movement to create mine prop forests has been launched throughout the city, with more than 300,000 people participating. This year, it is planned to afforest 653,000 mu, planting 35.5 million trees, accounting for more than 46% of the city's cultivated land area. It is expected that 70% of the annual afforestation task will be completed within March. Thanks to the preliminary survey of forest land, the division of cooperation zones, deep plowing of the land, and the application of base fertilizer, as well as the holding of forestry technical training classes to teach planting techniques, the quality of afforestation meets the requirements.
    Huainan City has been actively creating mine prop forests since 1952. In recent years, it has afforested more than 60,000 mu and planted 18.45 million trees. Many barren mountains and bald ridges have become green forest mountains, which not only supply some mine props but also increase farmers' income. Last year alone, more than 900,000 jin of fruit, 4 million jin of mountain grass, 1.5 million jin of pruned branches, and 1.5 million cubic meters of thinned timber were harvested.
    (By our correspondent in Tianjin on the 20th) In order to promote the development of the coal industry, Tangshan Prefecture is actively planning and constructing pit wood forests.
    Tangshan Prefecture is the location of Kailuan Coal Mine, one of China's largest coal mines. At present, 350,000 cubic meters of pit wood are needed annually, while the local area can only supply 3,500 cubic meters, with most of it being transferred from other places. Due to long-distance transportation, not only can timely supply not be guaranteed, but the cost of products is also increased.
    Since 1956, under the correct leadership and specific assistance of the central government and the province, the Tangshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office has begun planning and constructing pit wood forests. By 1958, various regions had constructed 50,000 mu of pit wood forests according to the plan. Generally, fast-growing tree species such as black locust, poplar, and willow were used, and better-conditioned forest land was selected, so the trees grew well. According to calculations, after the completion of 600,000 mu of pit wood forests in the entire prefecture (including 100,000 mu of existing young forests with relatively good conditions that are designated for pit wood forest management), 20,000 mu can be harvested starting in 1964. Calculating with 10,000 mu each of large and medium-diameter forests, it is estimated that 1.1 million cubic meters of timber will be produced, which can basically meet the needs of coal mine pit wood in the entire prefecture that year.
    Eight counties and cities in this prefecture, including Tangshan, Yutian, Jixian, Zunhua, Qian'an, Changli, Leting, and Qinhuangdao, have designated some barren land with better soil and cultivated land with poor cultivation conditions as pit wood forest construction bases. In order to help various regions with planning and design, the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office sent working groups to the three key areas of Ciyutuo in Luanzhou District of Tangshan City on March 7th to conduct specific planning and design.
    In order to do a good job in the construction of pit wood forests, leadership organs at all levels in this prefecture have strengthened the leadership of afforestation work. In addition to the fact that the Commissioner's Office has established a landscaping command to specifically lead this work, various cities and counties have planned to incorporate the construction of pit wood forests into the local afforestation and greening plan, designating special personnel to regularly supervise the implementation. Communes with pit wood forest construction tasks have also drawn out a certain amount of manpower to establish forest farms, specializing in regular construction work.

### 趁大好春光大造矿柱林  淮南计划营林六十五万亩唐山造林工作积极进行

    趁大好春光大造矿柱林
    淮南计划营林六十五万亩唐山造林工作积极进行
    本报讯　我国五大煤矿基地之一的淮南煤矿，采取自力更生的方针，大造矿柱林，以保证淮南煤矿用材的需要。
    根据中共安徽省委和淮安市委的决定，淮南市郊区除一部分耕地用来种植蔬菜外，其余全部营造矿柱林和栽植果树林、特用经济林；并结合林地进行混农作业，保证五年内作到矿柱自给，年产矿柱材六十至八十万立方公尺。
    现在，全市掀起了一个声势浩大的营造矿柱林运动，参加人数达三十万多人。今年计划造林六十五万三千亩，植树三千五百五十万株，占全市耕地面积的46％以上，预计3月内完成全年造林任务的70％。由于事前做好林地调查，划分了协作区，深翻了土地和施了基肥，并举办了林业技术训练班，传授栽植技术，因而造林质量合乎要求。
    淮南市从1952年起就积极营造矿柱林，几年来，已造林六万多亩，植树一千八百四十五万株。许多荒山秃岭已成为碧绿的林山，不但供应了部分矿柱，而且增加了农民的收入。仅去年就收获水果九十多万斤，山草四百万斤，修枝一百五十万斤，间伐木材一百五十万立方公尺。
    本报天津20日电　为促进煤炭工业发展，唐山专区正在积极规划营造坑木林。
    唐山专区是我国大煤矿之一——开滦煤矿的所在地。现在每年需要坑木三十五万立方公尺，而当地只能供应三千五百立方公尺，大部由外地调拨供应。由于远道运输，不仅不能保证及时供应，而且也增加了产品成本。
    唐山专署自1956年以来，在中央和省正确领导和具体帮助下，曾着手进行坑木林的规划和营造工作。至1958年，各地根据规划已营造坑木林五万亩，一般均采用了洋槐、杨、柳等速生树种，选择了条件较好的林地，因而林木生长良好。根据计算，全专区六十万亩坑木林（包括原有条件较好的幼林划为坑木林经营的十万亩）营造完成后，到1964年即可开始采伐二万亩；以大、中径级林各一万亩计算，预计产材一百一十万立方公尺，基本上可以满足当年全专区煤矿坑木的需要。
    这个专区的唐山、玉田、蓟县、遵化、迁安、昌黎、乐亭、秦皇岛等八个县市，已划出一部分土质较好的荒地和耕种条件较差的退耕地作为坑木林营造基地。为了帮助各地进行规划设计，地委和专署派出工作组，于3月7日分赴唐山市滦州区茨榆坨等三个重点，进行具体规划设计。
    为了作好坑木林营造工作，这个专区各级领导机关都加强了造林工作的领导。除专署已成立园林化指挥部具体领导这一工作外，各市、县已计划将营造坑木林纳入当地造林绿化计划，指定专人经常负责检查执行情况。有坑木林营造任务的公社也抽出一定力量建立林场，专门从事经常的营造工作。
