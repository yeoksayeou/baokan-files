Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on March 4th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin received Polish Ambassador to Moscow Gaide on March 2nd and handed him the Soviet government's note to the Polish government on the issue of a German peace treaty and the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin.

The note expressed satisfaction that the Polish government was willing to participate in the conference to prepare and conclude a German peace treaty and fully agreed with the draft German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government.

The note pointed out that, to date, the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a German peace treaty has been endorsed by nine countries that sent armed forces to fight against Hitler's Germany, representing nearly one billion people.

In the note, the Soviet government notified the Polish government of the exchange of letters with the United States, Britain, and France regarding the Soviet Union's specific proposals for concluding a German peace treaty, convening a conference of countries that participated in the war against Germany for this purpose, and normalizing the situation in Berlin.

The note pointed out that the Soviet government has once again raised the issue of holding a high-level meeting of heads of state with the Western countries' governments. The note said that if the Western countries are not yet ready to participate in a high-level meeting, then the Soviet government believes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia could be convened to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue. The Soviet government also agreed to the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France to allow representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in this meeting.

The Soviet government also sent the same note to the governments of other countries that had sent armed forces to fight against Hitler's Germany.

A note on this issue was also sent to the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: TASS reported from Moscow on March 4th: The Soviet government once again sent a note to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty and eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin.

The Soviet government's note pointed out that in its note to the Soviet government on February 16th of this year, the West German government did not respond to the specific proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty and convening a conference of countries that participated in the war against Germany for this purpose, and on normalizing the situation in Berlin, nor did it put forward any suggestions concerning the substance of the issue.

The Soviet government also reaffirmed that the nature and tone of the West German government's note to the Soviet government on January 5th of this year made it all the more apparent that the Federal government wanted to stir up extreme fanaticism and would not hesitate to obstruct a calm and objective discussion of the Soviet Union's proposals on the Berlin issue at any cost.

The Soviet government said in the note that the Soviet government once again puts forward the proposal to convene a high-level meeting of heads of state. It believes that representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic should participate in the study of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue at the high-level meeting.

If the Western countries' governments are still not prepared to participate in a high-level meeting, then the Soviet government believes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia could be convened to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue. The Soviet government agrees to the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic sending representatives to participate in this meeting.

    苏联就德国问题照会波兰等国
    通知关于苏联同美英法交换信件情况
    在给西德照会中指责西德当局阻挠解决德国问题
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林3月2日接见了波兰驻莫斯科大使盖德，把苏联政府就对德和约和消除西柏林占领制度问题致波兰政府的照会交给了他。
    照会中满意地谈到，波兰政府愿意参加准备和缔结对德和约的会议，并完全赞同苏联政府提出的对德和约草案。
    照会指出，到目前为止，苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议已经得到九个曾派武装部队对希特勒德国作过战的国家的赞同，这些国家有将近十亿人口。
    苏联政府在照会中把它同美、英、法三国就苏联关于缔结对德和约和为此召开对德参战国和会以及使柏林局势正常化的具体建议交换信件的情况通知了波兰政府。
    照会中指出，苏联政府已经再一次向西方国家政府提出了国家领导人举行高级会议的问题。照会说，如果西方国家还不准备参加高级会议，那么苏联政府认为，可以召开苏、美、英、法、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克外交部长会议，来讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题。苏联政府也同意美、英、法三国政府关于让德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加这次会议的建议。
    苏联政府还把同样的照会送给曾派武装部队对希特勒德国作过战的其他国家的政府。
    关于这个问题的照会也送交给德意志民主共和国政府。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联政府就缔结对德和约和消除西柏林占领制度问题，再次照会德意志联邦共和国政府。
    苏联政府的照会指出，西德政府在今年2月16日给苏联政府的照会中，没有对苏联就缔结对德和约和为此召开对德战争参加国和会以及使柏林局势正常化的问题提出的具体建议作出答复，没有提出任何涉及问题的实质的建议。
    苏联政府还确认，西德政府在今年1月5日给苏联政府的照会的性质和口吻使人更加认为，联邦政府想煽起极度狂热的情绪，不惜用任何代价来阻挠平心静气地和实事求是地讨论苏联关于柏林问题的建议。
    苏联政府在照会中说，苏联政府再一次提出关于召开国家领导人高级会议的建议。它认为，在高级会议上研究对德和约和西柏林问题时，应有德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表参加。
    如果西方国家政府仍然不准备参加高级会议，那么，苏联政府认为，可以召开苏、美、英、法、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克外交部长会议，来讨论对德和约和西柏林问题。苏联政府同意德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国派代表参加这个会议。
