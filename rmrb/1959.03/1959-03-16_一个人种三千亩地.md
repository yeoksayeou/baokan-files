Ordinary Person

    A tractor driver named Nicolae Simion from the Ivăneşti State Farm in Bucharest, Romania, is very famous in Romania. Because he can cultivate two hundred hectares of land (equivalent to 3,000 mu) by himself. He does everything from cultivation to harvesting, and the harvest is also high. In 1954, Nicolae Simion decided to cultivate two hundred hectares of land by himself, and the leaders of the state farm strongly supported him. That autumn, he planted one hundred hectares of wheat, and the following spring he planted another one hundred hectares of corn. As a result, the average wheat yield was 2,569 kilograms per hectare, and the corn reached 3,960 kilograms. Although there was a drought last year, thanks to his efforts, the harvest was still very good. Nicolae Simion's initiative has greatly reduced costs and greatly increased labor productivity.
    Nicolae Simion's achievement in labor is not accidental. Before liberation, he worked for landlords. For more than ten years, he lived with livestock. Although he suffered day and night, he was often hungry. After liberation, he became a tractor driver at the state farm. He deeply realized that today's labor is not to increase the income of the landlords, but to make the working people live better. Therefore, he put all his energy into his work and used his brains to come up with various ways to improve labor productivity.
    Nicolae Simion is able to cultivate so much land mainly because he is good at arranging work and protecting machines. He arranges the field work in an orderly manner, for example, before harvesting wheat, he hilled the soil in the cornfields. (Attached picture)

    一个人种三千亩地
    罗马尼亚布加勒斯特州伊凡尼什蒂国营农场的拖拉机手尼古拉·西米昂，在罗马尼亚很出名。因为他一个人能种二百公顷田地（合三千亩），从耕作到收割都是他自己干，收成也很高。1954年，尼古拉·西米昂决定一个人种二百公顷田地，国营农场的领导大力支持他。那年秋天，他种了一百公顷小麦，第二年春天又种了一百公顷玉米，结果小麦平均每公顷收割二千五百六十九公斤，玉米达到三千九百六十公斤。去年虽然干旱，但是由于他的努力，收成仍然很好。尼古拉·西米昂的创举使得成本降低很多，劳动生产率大大地提高了。
    尼古拉·西米昂获得这样的劳动成就并不是偶然的。解放前，他是给地主种地的，十多年间他都同牲畜住在一起，尽管白天黑夜受苦受累，可是还经常挨饿。解放后，他当了国营农场的拖拉机手，他深深体会到今天的劳动不是为了增加地主的收入，而是为了使劳动人民生活得更好。因此他把全部精力放在工作上，并且开动脑筋，想出各种办法来提高劳动生产率。
    尼古拉·西米昂能够种那么多的田地，主要是他善于安排工作和保护机器。他把田间工作安排得井井有条，譬如收割小麦以前，就把玉米地的土培好了。（附图片）
