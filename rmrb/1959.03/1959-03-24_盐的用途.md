    Uses of Salt

    Salt has extremely wide uses. In daily life, people cannot live without it for even a day; more importantly, it plays a vital role silently like an unsung hero on the industrial front.

    Salt has approximately two hundred industrial applications. Industries such as metallurgy, acid, alkali, ceramics, glass, dyes, soap, leather, medicine, and rayon all directly or indirectly use salt as a raw material or auxiliary material. Refining one ton of iron requires dozens of catties of soda ash (to remove sulfur), and this alkali is mainly made from salt. Chemical products such as terramycin, sulfa drugs, chloroprene rubber, 666, DDT, carbolic acid, antibiotics, amino molding powder, and sodium fluorosilicate also require salt. Salt can be used to prevent freezing during winter construction. Hard water can be softened with salt. In addition, adding salt to explosives can greatly improve their blasting power.

    Seawater, well brine, salt mines, and salt lakes also contain large amounts of various inorganic salts and metallic and non-metallic elements; the main ones include chlorine, sodium, hydrogen, oxygen, potassium, magnesium, bromine, calcium, boron, iodine, etc. In addition, they also contain various rare elements. Therefore, the by-products of salt production can be made into various products needed by the chemical industry, steel industry, pharmaceutical industry, and light industry.

    The uses of salt in agriculture and animal husbandry are also increasing day by day. Farmers use salt for seed selection. Ammonium chloride, a highly effective chemical fertilizer used to increase cotton and grain production, is made from salt. Granular fertilizers also require salt. Livestock eat an appropriate amount of salt every day, which not only improves their coat and reduces illness, but also makes them energetic and grow faster.

    盐的用途
    盐的用途极广。在日常生活中，人们一天也不能离开它；重要的是，它在工业的阵地上像一位无名的英雄，无声息地起着重要作用。
    盐在工业上的用途约有二百多种。冶金、酸、碱、陶瓷、玻璃、染料、肥皂、皮革、医药、人造纤维等工业，都直接或间接地用盐作原料或辅助材料。炼一吨铁需要几十斤纯碱（起去硫作用），这些碱主要是用盐制成的。土霉素、磺胺剂、氯丁橡胶、六六六、滴滴涕、石炭酸、抗菌素、氨基制粉、砩硅酸钠等化学产品，也都少不了盐。冬季施工用盐可以防冻。硬质的水可以用盐来软化。另外，炸药加盐能大大提高爆破能力。
    在海水，井卤水、盐矿和盐湖中，还蕴藏着大量的各种无机盐和金属，非金属元素；其中主要的有氯、钠、氢、氧、钾、镁、溴、钙、硼、碘等，另外还含有多种稀有元素。因此，制盐的副产品可以制成化学工业，钢铁工业、医药工业和轻工业等所需要的各种产品。
    盐在农业和畜牧业上的用途也一天天增多。农民用盐来选种。增产棉粮用的肥效高的化学肥料——氯化铵、是用盐制成的。颗粒肥料也需要盐。牲畜每天吃适量的盐，不但皮毛好，少生病，精力壮，而且长肉快。
