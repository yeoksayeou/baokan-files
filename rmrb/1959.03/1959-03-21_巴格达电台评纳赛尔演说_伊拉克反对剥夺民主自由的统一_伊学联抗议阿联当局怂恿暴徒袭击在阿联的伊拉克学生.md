　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 19th - Baghdad Radio commented on Arab United Republic President Nasser's speech on the 18th, saying, "The Iraqi people will continue to strengthen the struggle against world imperialism, Zionism, greedy Arab reactionaries, and anyone who claims to merge Arabs into one entity, because this unified body will deprive them of their democratic freedoms and guarantee that greedy elements" will be able to "dominate their destiny."
　　The commentary said: "The Iraqi people are determined to continue the common struggle to deal with the enemies of liberated Arabism and the enemies of democracy."
　　The commentary also refuted the view spread by the UAR propaganda organs that the Arab people's struggle against imperialism has ended.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 19th - According to Baghdad newspapers today, the General Union of Students of the Republic of Iraq issued a statement protesting to the authorities of the Arab United Republic regarding the attack on the Iraqi Student Union activity center in Cairo on the 11th.
　　The statement said that on March 11th, the chairman of the Iraqi Student Union in Cairo was thrown from the tenth floor and rolled to the seventh floor. His nose was broken and his eyes were swollen. One student was stabbed in the chest, and one of his ears was cut off. At the same time, many other similar attacks occurred. The statement pointed out that if the Iraqi members of the Cultural Solidarity Organization had not intervened in the matter, the attack would have resulted in the deaths of some students.
　　The statement called on "all students of Arab countries, their organizations, and the Arab people to condemn this atrocity."
　　The statement also requested the Iraqi government to take necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such actions. Due to this threat, Iraqi students in Cairo are now unable to continue their studies.

    新华社巴格达19日电　巴格达电台18日在评论阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔的演说时说，“伊拉克人民将继续加强斗争，反对世界帝国主义、犹太复国主义、贪婪的阿拉伯反动派和自称要将阿拉伯人合并成一体的任何人，因为这种统一体将剥夺他们的民主自由，并且保证贪婪分子”能够“支配他们的命运”。
    评论说：“伊拉克人民决心继续进行共同的斗争，来对付解放了的阿拉伯主义的敌人和民主的敌人。”
