    Rio de Janeiro dispatch: The Brazilian House of Representatives will discuss a bill to restrict the remittance of profits by foreign companies. According to reports, the bill, proposed by Labor Party member Sérgio Magalhães, stipulates that the amount of profits remitted by foreign companies should be limited to between 8% and 10% of profits.
    This bill has the support of Brazilian Army Minister Lott. The Brazilian newspaper "Última Hora" published Lott's statement on the matter on the 16th. The statement advocates for Brazil to restrict the outflow of profits from foreign companies, requiring profits exceeding the limit to be reinvested in Brazil.
    Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Brazil's largest industrial and commercial city, a gathering of five hundred union leaders on the evening of the 16th passed a petition addressed to Brazilian President Kubitschek, expressing support for Lott's statement and calling on the government to adopt measures to restrict the interests of foreign companies and support national industry and commerce to overcome economic difficulties and stabilize rising prices.
    It is reported that the privileges of foreign monopoly capital, mainly American capital, which controls many important industrial sectors in Brazil in terms of investment, is one of the important reasons for Brazil's economic difficulties.

    巴西陆军部长发表声明
    主张限制外国公司汇出利润
    里约热内卢消息：巴西众议院将讨论一项限制外国公司汇出利润的法案。消息说，由劳工党议员塞尔希奥·马瓦莱斯提出的这项法案，规定把外国公司汇出利润的数量限制在利润的8％到10％以内。
    这一法案得到巴西陆军部长洛特的支持。巴西“最后一点钟报”16日刊载了洛特为此发表的声明。声明主张巴西限制外国公司利润的外溢，要求把限额以外的利润在巴西重新投资。
    同时，在巴西最大的工商业城市圣保罗，有五百名工会领袖参加的集会在16日晚上通过了一封写给巴西总统库比契克的请愿书，表示支持洛特的声明，并且要求政府采取限制外国公司利益和扶助民族工商业的办法来克服经济困难和稳定日益上涨的物价。
    据报道，控制着巴西许多重要工业部门的外国垄断资本、主要是美国资本在投资方面的特权，是使巴西遭到经济困难的重要原因之一。
