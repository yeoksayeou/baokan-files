Plants and Water
    Lu Feng

    No living being can live without water for a moment, and this is especially true for crops. Lack of water or untimely supply will have adverse effects on its growth and development, reducing yield and deteriorating product quality.

    Why is water so important to plants?

    If we cover some fresh plant material with cold glass and heat it in an oven, or put it in the sun to dry, after a while we will find "water vapor" droplets on the glass, and the material will also greatly reduce in weight. This phenomenon shows that plants contain water, and water is an important component of the plant organism. Dry seeds contain the least amount of water, about 3%-15%, but they are only in a dormant state, and their life activities are very weak. If seeds are given an appropriate amount of water (in addition to air and a suitable temperature), they will germinate and grow, beginning intense life activities. This also shows that water is a necessary condition for life activities. General plants contain 60%-80% water, vegetables and tuber crops contain 90%-95% water, and some aquatic plants contain more than 98% water!

    Plants need to carry out photosynthesis to produce organic matter, which is then used to build their bodies and obtain the energy needed for their life activities. The raw materials for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water. Almost half of the organic matter produced by photosynthesis is composed of carbon, and the other half is composed of hydrogen and oxygen—that is, the elements that make up water.

    Although plants contain a large amount of water, the amount of water needed to compose the plant only accounts for 0.1%-0.2% of the total water needed by the plant. The remaining 99.8% or more of the water is consumed in the transpiration process during plant growth (a life phenomenon that is physiologically regulated by the plant, which is different from the evaporation of free water surface, so it is called transpiration). The huge leaf surface of plants is exposed to the air and illuminated by the sun. This inevitably leads to a large consumption of water due to the strong transpiration of the leaf surface. This may seem like a "loss," but it is necessary for plant life. Because only the contact between the leaf surface and the air can obtain the carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis; and only by receiving sunlight can the energy needed for photosynthesis be obtained. At the same time, as water continuously evaporates from the leaf surface, a kind of "transpiration pull" is formed. This pull (in addition to the pressure from the roots) is like an invisible water pump, drawing water from the roots through the stem to the leaves, thus forming a continuously rising water flow to replenish the water on the leaf surface. In this way, the nutrients in the soil dissolved in this water—nitrogen and mineral elements—are continuously transported to all parts of the plant along with the rising water flow for plant use. This is the most important way for plants to absorb nutrients. In addition, some heat is also taken away during the process of water transpiration, so that the leaf surface will not be "scalded" by the strong sunlight. This is the same principle as animals using sweating to lower their body temperature. Therefore, the famous Soviet plant physiologist Academician Timiryazev called this "loss" of plant water transpiration a "necessary physical disaster for plants."

    This "expenditure" of plant water is quite considerable. A corn plant consumes 1.64 kilograms of water every day and more than 200 kilograms in its lifetime; a sunflower consumes 5.4 kilograms of water every day. Wheat and other cereal crops consume 300 to 400 kilograms of water in summer for every kilogram of dry matter produced; to produce 3,500 kilograms of wheat grains per mu, including its straw, requires 2.1 million kilograms to 2.8 million kilograms of water in summer. If this water is stored in a pond with an area of one mu, the water layer would be 31 to 42 centimeters deep!

    If the soil moisture is insufficient, or if the plant's water absorption cannot meet the needs of transpiration in the hot summer noon, the plant's water "income" is less than its "expenditure," disrupting the coordination of plant water metabolism, then the cells in the leaves and the tender parts of the stem will lose turgor pressure due to lack of water, and these parts of the plant will not be able to maintain their plump state and droop down. This phenomenon is called "wilting."

    The cells of the plant's growing point can only undergo cell division and increase in volume when they are full of water, which means that the plant can grow; when the plant wilts, its growth stagnates. Photosynthesis can only proceed smoothly when the leaf surface cells are saturated with water. When the plant wilts, the stomata on the leaf surface (the main channel for gas exchange between the plant leaves and the outside world and the portal for regulating water transpiration) close, hindering the entry of carbon dioxide into the leaves. At the same time, the drooping and curling of the leaves also affect the leaf surface's reception of sunlight, thus photosynthesis is greatly inhibited. When wilting occurs, other life activities in the plant are also disrupted. If this wilting is temporary and does not last for a long time, the plant will return to its original state after timely water supply; but this does not mean that it will not have any bad consequences for the plant. If the wilting lasts for too long, even if sufficient water is supplied, the plant cannot recover and eventually withers and dies!

    Nutrients in the soil must also be dissolved in water before they can be absorbed, transported and utilized by plants; various biochemical changes and the transport of organic matter in plants must also use water as a medium. In the case of heavy fertilization, there must be sufficient water to dissolve the fertilizer and dilute the nutrients, in order to better exert the fertilizer effect and prevent the plant from being "burned to death" due to excessive nutrient concentration. When there is appropriate moisture in the soil, it can also promote the activity of beneficial microorganisms.

    Is water so important to plants that the more the better without any limit? No. In addition to needing to obtain nutrients and water from the soil, plants also require appropriate air in the soil. Because the growth of plant roots and the absorption of nutrients and water require a certain amount of energy, which is obtained in the process of decomposing organic matter by root respiration; respiration requires air. If there is too much soil moisture, the air will be relatively lacking, and the plant roots will be suffocated and rot, and the above-ground parts will also wither and die. This is what is commonly referred to as "waterlogging." At the same time, only when there is a certain amount of air in the soil can the aerobic bacteria in it be very active, promoting the decomposition of fertilizer, and the effective nutrients needed by plants can be maximized, while other bacteria such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and rhizobia can better fix nitrogen. If there is too much soil moisture and the air is very lacking, not only will the above process be affected, but a chemical process called "denitrification" will occur, turning effective nutrients into ineffective ones. In addition, if the soil lacks air and the activity of anaerobic bacteria is too strong while the activity of aerobic bacteria is weak, a large amount of organic acids will accumulate in the soil, poisoning the plant roots. This phenomenon is particularly significant in paddy fields where a large amount of unfermented organic fertilizer is applied.

    Keeping an appropriate amount of moisture in the soil and timely meeting the crop's water needs is an important key to achieving a bumper harvest. However, the natural precipitation (rain and snow), which is an important source of soil moisture, is very uneven under the specific climatic conditions in our country, with some seasons having particularly much and some seasons having particularly little. This requires more artificial regulation. Correct soil tillage (such as deep plowing, intertillage, weeding, etc.) and excellent cultivation techniques are all means of regulating soil moisture, but the fundamental and powerful means is to vigorously develop water conservancy, carry out artificial irrigation and drainage, and prevent both drought and waterlogging.

    Different crops, even different varieties, have different water requirements; the same crop and the same variety have different water requirements at different stages of development; water requirements are also different under different climate and soil conditions. Generally, the period when crops grow fastest and most luxuriantly and when the differentiation of tissues and organs is strongest, such as the jointing and booting stages of wheat, is the period when water is most needed and most urgent. Lack of water at this time can easily lead to a sharp decline in yield. Therefore, reasonable irrigation must be based on different crops and their different stages of growth and development, and closely combined with climate and soil conditions, using the best irrigation methods to dissolve appropriate water and fertilizer to ensure that crops can obtain sufficient water and nutrients at each stage of development. In 1958, Chinese farmers created a wealth of irrigation experience. We must strive for a greater leap forward this year on this basis.

    植物和水
    鲁峰
    任何生物一时一刻也不能离开水，农作物更是这样。水分缺乏或是供应不及时，都会对它的生长和发育产生不良的影响，使产量降低，产品品质变劣。
    水对植物为什么这样重要呢？
    我们试把较新鲜的植物材料盖上冷玻璃加热烘烤，或是放在太阳下晒，一会儿我们便会在玻璃上发现有“气溜水”的水珠，材料也因而大大减轻重量。这现象表明：植物体内含有水，水是植物有机体的重要组成部分。干燥的种子含水量最少，约3％—15％，但它只处于休眠状态，生命活动非常微弱。若给种子加以适量的水分（另外再供给空气和适当的温度），它就会萌动发芽和生长，开始强烈的生命活动。这又说明：水分，是生命活动所必需的条件。一般的植物体都含有60％—80％的水，蔬菜和块茎块根作物含水达90％—95％，而某些水生植物含水竟达98％以上！
    植物要通过光合作用来制造有机物，从而用来建造自己的身体，并由此获得自身生命活动所需的能量。而光合作用的原料，便是二氧化碳和水。光合作用产生的有机物，几乎一半是由碳组成，另一半则由氢和氧——即构成水的元素所组成。
    尽管植物所含水分很大，但组成植物的需水量只不过占植物总需水量的0.1％—0.2％，其余99.8％以上的水分，都消耗在植物生长期间的蒸腾作用上（经过植物生理调节作用的一种生命现象，和自由水面的蒸发不同，故叫作蒸腾）。植物的庞大的叶面裸露在空气中，并为太阳所照射。这就不可避免地因叶面强烈的蒸腾作用而引起水分的大量消耗。这看来似乎是一种“损失”，然而却是植物生活所必需的。因为，只有叶面和空气的接触，才能获得光合作用所需的二氧化碳；也只有接受阳光的照射，才能获得光合作用所需的能量。同时，由于水分从叶面不断地跑去，就形成一种“蒸腾引力”，这种引力（另外还有来自根部的压力），好像是一架无形的抽水机，把水由根部经茎部引至叶部，从而形成一股不断上升的水流，来补足叶面的水分。这样，溶解在这水中的土壤中的养分——氮素和矿物元素，随着上升水流源源不绝地运至植物体的各部，供植物应用。这是植物摄取营养元素的最主要的方式。另外，在水分蒸腾的过程中也带走一些热量，使叶面不致因受太阳光的强烈照射而“烫伤”。这和动物用发汗来降低体温是一个道理。所以，苏联著名的植物生理学家季米里亚节夫院士，把这种植物水分蒸腾的“损失”，称为是“植物必需的物理灾害”。
    植物水分的这项“支出”是相当可观的。一株玉米每天要消耗水分一点六四公斤，一生要消耗二百多公斤；一株向日葵每天消耗水分五点四公斤。小麦等禾谷类作物，每造成一公斤干物质，在夏季要消耗三百至四百公斤的水；要亩产三千五百公斤的小麦籽实，连同它的藁秆，则在夏季就需水二百一十万公斤至二百八十万公斤，这些水若盛在一亩面积的池中，水层就有三十一至四十二公分深！
    假如土壤水分不足，或是在夏季酷热的中午植物的吸水量满足不了蒸腾的需求，植物水分“收入”不敷“支出”，破坏了植物水分代谢的协调，则叶部以及茎的幼嫩部分的细胞，因缺水而失去膨压，植株这些部分就不能保持丰满状态而垂下来。这种现象叫做“萎蔫”。
    植物生长点的细胞，只有在充满水分的时候，才能进行细胞的分裂和增大体积，也就是说植物才能生长；植物萎蔫的时候，它们的生长就陷于停顿。也只有在叶面细胞被水饱和着的时候，光合作用才能顺利进行。植物萎蔫的时候，叶面气孔（植物叶部和外界进行气体交换的要道和调节水分蒸腾的门户）关闭，阻碍了二氧化碳的进入叶内，同时，叶的下垂和卷曲也影响叶面接受日光，因而光合作用受到极大的抑制。萎蔫的时候，植物体内其他生命活动也遭到了破坏。这种萎蔫如果是暂时的，持续的时间不长，及时供水以后，植株又会恢复原来的状态；但这并不是对植物不产生一点坏的后果。如果萎蔫持续过久，即使供给了充足的水分，植株也不能恢复，终于枯萎死亡！
    土壤中的营养物质也必须溶解在水中，才能被植物吸收、导输和应用；植物体内各种生物化学的变化和有机物的转运，也必须以水作为介质。在大量施肥的情况下，必须有充足的水分来溶解肥料、稀释养分，以便更好地发挥肥效和防止因养分太浓而把植株“烧死”。土壤中有适当水分存在时，更能促进有益微生物的活动。
    水分对植物这样重要，是不是要无限制的越多越好呢？不是。植物除了需要从土壤中取得养料和水分以外，同时还要求土壤中有适当的空气。因为植物根的生长和对养分、水分的吸收等活动，要求一定的能量，这能量便是借根的呼吸作用分解有机物质的过程中取得的；呼吸，就需要空气。土壤水分过多，相对地空气就非常缺乏，植物根会因此遭到窒息而腐烂，地上部分也随之枯死。这就是通常所说的“涝”。同时，只有土壤中有一定空气存在时，其中的好氧性细菌才能很好地活动，促进肥料的分解，植物所需的有效养分才能得到最大的满足，而其他如固氮菌和根瘤菌，才能很好地固定氮素。若土壤水分过多，空气非常缺乏，不但影响以上过程的进行，反而会产生一种叫作“反硝化”作用的化学过程，使有效的养分变成无效。另外，土壤空气缺乏，嫌气性细菌活动过分强烈，好气性细菌活动微弱，土壤中便会积累大量的有机酸，而使植物根部中毒。这种现象，在大量施用未腐熟的有机肥料的水田中，尤为显著。
    使土壤中经常保持适量的水分，及时满足作物对水分的需要，是取得作物丰收的重要关键。但是，作为土壤水分的重要来源的天然降水（雨和雪），在我国具体气候条件下是很不均衡的，有的季节特别多，有的季节又特别少。这就更需要人工的调节。正确的土壤耕作（如深耕、中耕、除草等）和优良的栽培技术，都是调节土壤水分的手段，但是，根本的、有力的手段，还是大兴水利，进行人工的灌溉和排水，防旱又防涝。
    各种不同的作物，甚至不同的品种，需水量是不同的；同一作物、同一品种在它们各个不同的发育阶段中，需水量也是不同的；在不同的气候、土壤等条件下，需水量也是不同的。一般地在作物生长最快最茂盛和组织器官分化最强烈的时期，例如小麦的抽茎和孕穗期，是需水量最多、最迫切的时期，这时水分的缺乏，就易造成产量的锐减。所以，合理的灌溉，必须是根据不同的作物和他们不同的生长发育阶段，并密切结合气候、土壤情况，用最好的灌溉方法，使适当的水分和养肥相溶，保证作物在每个发育阶段上，都能获得足够的水分和养分。1958年我国农民创造了丰富的灌溉经验，我们要在这个基础上争取今年更大的跃进。
