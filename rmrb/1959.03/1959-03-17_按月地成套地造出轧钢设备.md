    Manufacture Rolling Mill Equipment in Complete Sets on a Monthly Basis

    Currently, the most urgently needed raw material for all industrial production and capital construction units is steel. The absolute quantity of steel to be increased in this year's national plan is much larger than in 1958. The increase in steel production will depend, to a large extent, on newly added rolling mill equipment, in addition to tapping the production potential of existing rolling mills. Therefore, how to ensure the timely production of various rolling mill equipment in complete sets has become an urgent task for the machinery industry sector.

    As everyone knows, our task on the iron and steel front is not only to refine iron into steel, but also to roll steel into materials. According to general principles, about 70% of steel production must be rolled into various types of steel before it can be used for production and construction. Last year, in order to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward, a batch of rolling mill equipment was produced, but some of the equipment could not be put into production due to incomplete sets. This year's national steel production task is even greater, so the need for rolling mill equipment is also greater. After the rolling mill equipment is produced, it takes a long time from installation to production. Therefore, the machinery industry sector must expedite the production of rolling mill equipment stipulated in this year's national plan. In the past two months or so, the machinery industry sector has produced a batch of rolling mill equipment, but it is far from meeting the needs. March and the second quarter must be vigorously grasped, so that the rolling mills manufactured in the first half of the year can be installed and produce more steel in the second half of the year, because even if the rolling mills produced in the second half of the year can be installed, the time available to use them to produce steel will not be much. Therefore, in order to ensure the realization of this year's steel production increase plan, relevant enterprises and units need to effectively arrange the production tasks of rolling mill equipment, not only to implement the monthly delivery plan strictly by quarter, but only to advance, not to postpone.

    Rolling mill equipment must be in complete sets. Because if it is not in complete sets, it cannot be installed and put into production in time, and the plan to increase steel production on a monthly and quarterly basis cannot be realized. The current solution to the problem of complete-set production is mainly to seize the production of auxiliary machines and accessories. In particular, we must seize the motor matching and control equipment matching. Some auxiliary equipment, such as shearing equipment and roller conveyors, have not yet been matched, and attention should also be paid to solving them quickly. The way to ensure that the equipment is in complete sets is to arrange production in complete sets in the plan first. For every set of mainframe, a set of auxiliary machines and accessories should be arranged accordingly. The second is to strengthen collaboration. Relevant enterprises need to put the collaborative tasks of rolling mills in the primary position to ensure timely delivery. The relevant central departments are strengthening equipment matching work, and the industrial departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should also, in the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," properly arrange plans and strengthen collaboration, and first ensure the complete supply of rolling mill equipment needed by key iron and steel enterprises.

    To make this batch of rolling mill equipment manufactured in a timely and complete set, it is necessary to concentrate the use of raw materials. The concentrated and rational use of raw materials is an important move in "the whole country as one chessboard." According to the order of importance and urgency, using raw materials in the most critical places can give priority to ensuring key points and promote smoother leaps forward in production and construction. Raw materials allocated by the state for the manufacture of rolling mill equipment must be used for special purposes and cannot be used to manufacture other products. In addition to the plans arranged by the state, various localities should not add additional rolling mill manufacturing tasks to avoid the dispersed use of raw materials and the inability to guarantee the needs of key enterprises.

    This year's rolling mill equipment manufacturing task is particularly heavy. In terms of quantity, it exceeds any previous year; in terms of variety, it is diverse. Except for a very few types of rolling mills that do not need to be produced, this year will basically produce all varieties of rolling mills. The characteristics of rolling mill equipment are that the parts are heavy, the volume is large, and the matching is complex. Some factories may encounter difficulties in production due to the lack of large-scale processing equipment. However, where there are difficulties, there must be ways to overcome them. The current main tasks are to break through the blank barrier and the processing barrier. Generally, steel castings account for about 65% of the total weight of a rolling mill, and forgings account for 10%. To produce such heavy and large castings and forgings, it is necessary to have certain thermal processing capabilities to solve problems such as blank modeling, casting, cleaning, forging, and lifting and transportation. However, general small and medium-sized machinery factories often lack such large-scale thermal processing equipment. This is the blank barrier. Manufacturing rolling mills not only requires processing large workpieces, but also has many key specialized processes. These processes, such as processing herringbone gears, spline shaft grooves, and reduction gears, also lack corresponding processing equipment in many factories. This is the processing barrier. Therefore, how to overcome the above-mentioned weak links, strive to break through the blank barrier and the processing barrier, and seize the blanks and processing, especially the key cold processing technology, are two important links in the technical aspect of rolling mill production this year. In last year's Great Leap Forward, many factories created valuable experience in these areas. For example, using small electric furnaces to load more and smelt quickly to pour large parts; replacing steel with iron and forging with casting; improving from the design to reduce the size and combine small parts into large parts; adopting slag welding to solve the problem of combining small parts into large parts from the processing technology; and using small machine tools to process large workpieces, etc. These effective experiences prove that even under the conditions of insufficient large-scale equipment, as long as the masses are earnestly mobilized, the blank barrier and the processing barrier can be broken through and the rolling mill can be manufactured.

    "Take steel as the key link and make an all-round leap forward" is the current guiding principle of China's economic construction. This year, with the production of 18 million tons of steel as the key link, the entire national economy will see a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. One of the keys to achieving this greater leap forward is to manufacture a large number of complete sets of rolling mill equipment in a timely manner, so that they can be quickly put into production and roll out more steel to meet the urgent needs of all aspects. To complete this glorious task, it is necessary to give full play to people's subjective initiative, give greater play to favorable conditions, and transform unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. What is the key to giving full play to people's subjective initiative? It is to carry out mass movements centered on technological revolution. In 1958, the machinery industry sector created many good experiences. The most fundamental one was to mobilize the masses, emancipate the mind, break superstitions, and carry out a technological revolution. This year, as long as we firmly grasp this key, continue to deeply mobilize the masses, and carry out technological innovation movements, all kinds of technical difficulties in manufacturing can be solved, and the task of manufacturing rolling mill equipment can definitely be victoriously completed.

    Two and a half months have passed in the first quarter. Time waits for no one. In order to ensure that production and construction receive a large amount of steel in a timely manner, machinery workers, mobilize to seize the time, go all out, and give full play to creativity, and fight for the monthly and complete manufacture of a large number of rolling mill equipment!

    按月地成套地造出轧钢设备
    当前各个工业生产、基本建设单位最迫切需要的原材料是钢材。今年国家计划中规定增产的钢材的绝对数量比1958年大得多。钢材的增产，除了挖掘现有轧钢机的生产潜力以外，很大一部分要依靠新增加的轧钢设备。因此，如何保证成套地如期地赶制出各种轧钢设备，就成为当前机械工业部门的一项紧迫的任务。
    大家知道，我们在钢铁战线上的任务，不但是要把铁炼成钢，而且要使钢轧成材。按照一般规律，钢产量中约有70％左右要在轧制成各式各样的钢材以后，才能用于生产建设。去年为了适应大跃进的形势，增产了一批轧钢设备，但是，还有一部分设备因配套不齐，还不能投入生产。今年全国的钢材生产任务更大，因此对于轧钢设备的需要也就更大了。而轧钢设备生产出来以后，从安装到生产又需要一段较长的时间。所以，机械工业部门必须把今年国家计划规定生产的轧钢设备尽快赶制出来。最近两个多月，机械工业部门已经制出了一批轧钢设备，但还远远不能满足需要。3月份和第二季度必须大力抓紧，使上半年制造出来的轧钢机能够安装起来，并在下半年生产更多的钢材，因为下半年生产出的轧钢机，即使能安装起来，能用来生产钢材的时间就不多了。因此，为了保证实现今年的钢材增产计划，就需要有关企业单位切实地安排好轧钢设备的生产任务，不仅要按季而且要严格执行按月的交付计划，只能提前，不能推后。
    轧钢设备必须成套。因为不成套就不能及时安装并投入生产，按月按季增产钢材的计划也就不能实现。而当前解决成套生产的问题，主要是抓紧辅机和配件的生产。特别是要抓紧电机配套和控制设备的配套。有的辅助设备，如剪断设备、辊道等，还没有配套，也要注意迅速解决。保证设备成套的办法，首先是在计划中就要成套地安排生产，有一套主机，就要相应地安排一套辅机和配件。其次是加强协作，各有关企业需要把轧钢机的协作任务放在首要地位，保证按期交货。中央有关部门已在加强设备配套工作，各省、市、自治区的工业主管部门也应该本着“全国一盘棋”的精神，妥善安排计划，加强协作，首先保证成套供应重点钢铁企业所需的轧钢设备。
    要使这批轧钢设备及时成套地赶制出来，需要集中使用原材料。原材料集中合理地使用，是“全国一盘棋”的重要一着。按照轻重缓急，把原材料用在最带关键性的地方，就能优先保证重点，促使生产建设更顺利地跃进。凡是国家分配用来制造轧钢设备的原材料，一定要专材专用，不能挪用制造其他产品。各地在国家安排的计划以外，也不应另外追加轧钢机制造任务，以免原材料分散使用，不能保证重点企业的需要。
    今年轧钢设备的制造任务特别繁重。从数量上看，超过以往任何一年；从品种方面看，是多种多样的，除极少数几种轧钢机不需生产外，今年要基本上生产出全部品种的轧钢机。轧钢设备的特点是部件重，体积大，配套复杂，有些厂子在生产中会碰到大型加工设备不足的困难。但是，有困难也一定有克服困难的办法。当前主要是要突破毛坯关和加工关。一般轧钢机的铸钢件的比重约占全重的65％，锻件的比重占10％。要生产这种又重又大的铸件和锻件，就需要具备一定的热加工能力，来解决毛坯的造型、浇铸、清理、锻压和起重运输等问题。而一般中小型机械厂往往缺乏这种大型的热加工设备。这是毛坯关。制造轧钢机不仅要加工大工件，而且有很多关键的专门性工艺。这些工艺，如加工人字齿轮、梅花轴槽、减速齿轮等工件，在许多工厂也都缺乏相应的加工设备。这是加工关。因此，如何克服上述的薄弱环节，努力突破毛坯关和加工关，抓紧毛坯和加工、特别是关键性的冷加工工艺，是今年轧钢机生产技术方面的两个重要环节。在去年的大跃进中，不少工厂在这些方面创造了宝贵的经验。例如，用小电炉多装快炼，浇注出大部件来；以铁代钢，以铸代锻；从设计上改进，化大为小，以小拼大；采用溶渣焊，从加工技术上解决以小拼大的问题，以及用小机床加工大工件等等。这些行之有效的经验证明，即令在大型设备不足的条件下，只要认真发动群众，便可以突破毛坯关和加工关，把轧钢机制造出来。
    “以钢为纲，全面跃进”，是当前我国经济建设的方针。今年以生产一千八百万吨钢为纲，整个国民经济将出现更大更好更全面的跃进。实现这一更大跃进的关键之一，就是要及时赶制出大批成套的轧钢设备，使其迅速投入生产，轧出更多的钢材，供应各方面的迫切需要。完成这一光荣任务，必须要充分发挥人的主观能动性，使有利条件发挥更大的作用，使不利条件转化为有利条件。充分发挥人的主观能动性的钥匙是什么呢？就是大搞以技术革命为中心的群众运动。1958年机械工业部门创造了许多好经验，最根本的一条就是发动群众，解放思想，破除迷信，大搞技术革命。今年只要紧紧掌握住这把钥匙，继续深入发动群众，开展技术革新运动，制造技术上的种种困难，都是可以解决的，赶制轧钢设备的任务是一定能够胜利完成的。
    第一季度已经过去两个半月了。时不我待。为了保证生产建设及时得到大量钢材，机械工人们，动员起来抓紧时间，鼓足干劲，发扬创造力，为按月地成套地造出大批轧钢设备而战！
