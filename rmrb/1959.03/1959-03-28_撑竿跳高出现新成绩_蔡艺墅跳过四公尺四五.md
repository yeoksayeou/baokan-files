    New Achievement in Pole Vaulting
    Cai Yishu Clears 4.45 Meters
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th: The famous pole vaulter Cai Yishu cleared a height of 4.45 meters in Guangzhou on the 26th, breaking the national record. The national pole vault record was 4.42 meters, which Cai Yishu himself set at the Third Beijing People's Sports Meeting last October.
    At noon on the 26th, at the pole vault competition venue of the First Guangdong Provincial Games, the crossbar on the high jump stand was raised to 3.80 meters. At this time, only Cai Yishu attempted the jump. He easily cleared this height, and then jumped over 4 meters, followed by 4.30 meters.
    When the height was raised to 4.45 meters, the referee measured it again and again. This was a new height, one that Chinese pole vaulters had never cleared before. Cai Yishu failed on his first attempt. For his second attempt, Cai Yishu again stood his pole in front of the high jump stand, measured it, and saw that the pole was not as high as the crossbar. He also looked at the spot where he had taken off just now, turned his head, and walked to the starting point of the runway. When the referee waved the red flag, he sprinted forward at high speed, inserted the pole into the sandpit, and his body soared into the air. In an instant, his body crossed the crossbar, followed by the sound of him landing in the sandpit. At this time, the crossbar remained motionless on the stand. Cai Yishu succeeded in jumping 4.45 meters.
    The wind speed was 1.6 meters when Cai Yishu cleared this height, which is within the regulations. The national referee present was Lei Ruilin.

    撑竿跳高出现新成绩
    蔡艺墅跳过四公尺四五
    新华社广州26日电　著名的撑竿跳高运动员蔡艺墅26日在广州越过四公尺四十五公分的高度，打破了全国纪录。撑竿跳高的全国纪录是四公尺四十二公分，那是去年10月蔡艺墅自己在北京市第三届人民体育运动大会上创造的。
    26日中午十二时，在广东省第一届运动会撑竿跳高比赛场地上，跳高架上的横竿升到了三公尺八十公分。这时，只有蔡艺墅一个人试跳，他轻易地越过了这个高度，随即跳过四公尺，接着，他又跳过了四公尺三十公分的高度。
    高度升到四公尺四十五公分，裁判员把量尺量了又量。这是个新的高度，我国撑竿跳高运动员从来没有跨越过它。蔡艺墅第一次试跳失败了。第二次蔡艺墅把自己撑跳用的竿子在跳高架前再次竖起来，量了一下，竿子没有横竿高，他又看了看自己刚才起跳的脚迹，扭过头来就走向跑道的起点。当裁判员的红旗一挥，他就用高速的快步奔向前方，竿子在沙坑一插，身子就凌空而起，刹那间，他的身体就越过了横竿，接着就是他落下沙池的声音。这时横竿丝毫不动地留在架上，蔡艺墅跳四公尺四十五公分成功了。
    蔡艺墅越过这个高度时，风速是一点六公尺，符合规定。在场的国家裁判是雷瑞林。
