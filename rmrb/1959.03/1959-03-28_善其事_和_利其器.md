    "To Do a Good Job" and "To Sharpen One's Tools"
    Ge De
    When I was a child, my teacher told me, "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." Later, I forgot everything else, but I remembered this sentence clearly. One reason was that the teacher explained it in a simple and understandable way, saying, "If you plan to do a piece of work well, you must first tidy up the tools you will use. For example, if you want to chop firewood, you must first sharpen your axe." The second reason was that life experience constantly confirmed this principle: to fish, you must first weave a net; to cut wheat, you must first sharpen your sickle; to spin thread, you must first prepare a spinning wheel... In short, I have always firmly believed in this principle.
    Later, as I gained more life experience, I became more critical of this sentence. First, I questioned the words "must first." I felt that the words "must first" somewhat neglected the subjective initiative of people. Some people overemphasized it, and in war, there was the theory of weapons as the sole factor, denying that we could defeat enemies with superior equipment; in construction, there was also the theory of conditions as the sole factor, denying that we could build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. But the fact is that, relying on people, we used millet and rifles to eliminate enemies armed to the teeth; relying on people, we achieved a Great Leap Forward in a poor and blank country, where one day was equal to twenty years. Furthermore, relating it to life experience: without a net, you can still catch fish by hand; without a sickle, you can still pull wheat by hand; without a spinning wheel, you can still spin cotton thread by hand. Thus, I understood that people are the most active factor in production. In this way, our enthusiasm grew, our spirit of overcoming difficulties was strengthened, and we worked with greater vigor. This was indeed a spiritual liberation.
    However, soon, life made further criticisms, and my understanding of that sentence was still superficial. First, I heard about Su Guangming. Su Guangming was able to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and also completed the second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The 1958 plan leaped three times, all determined by his continuous improvement of tools, which is "sharpening one's tools." Then, news of the "vehicle-ization" and "bearing-ization" of farm tool reform movements came from the countryside, which was also "sharpening one's tools," and work efficiency was multiplied. At this time, experience made me compare again:
    Fishing by hand: only one fish at a time; hand-net fishing: a net can catch more than a dozen; motorboat fishing: a net can yield hundreds of pounds;
    Pulling wheat: one person can only do one mu a day; cutting wheat with a sickle: one person can cut three mu a day; harvesting wheat with a combine harvester: dozens of mu a day;
    Spinning thread: one person can only do one or two a day; hand-cranked spinning wheel: one person can spin one jin a day; using a spinning machine: one person per shift can spin about 180 kilograms.
    Fishing by hand is far worse than fishing with a hand-net, and fishing with a hand-net is far worse than fishing with a motorboat; pulling wheat is much slower than cutting with a sickle, and cutting with a sickle is much slower than a combine harvester; hand-spinning thread produces much less than a hand-cranked spinning wheel, and a hand-cranked spinning wheel produces much less than a spinning machine. Doesn't this prove that: manual tools are far superior to bare hands, and mechanization is far superior to manual tools; the role of tools cannot be ignored!
    By unifying people's subjective initiative with the significant role of tools, I have a deeper understanding of the saying "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." Take production for example: "To do a good job" means on the one hand, to continuously improve output and quality, and on the other hand, to continuously reduce people's labor intensity. Cutting wheat with a sickle is "better" than pulling wheat by hand, and harvesting wheat with a combine harvester is even "better" than cutting with a sickle. "To sharpen one's tools" means to constantly improve tools.
  The methods of "sharpening" are one is "improve": improve the old ones; the other is "create": create new ones. If you want to constantly "do good," you must constantly "sharpen." Both the word "good" and the word "sharpen" require people to exert greater initiative, rather than negating people's subjective initiative. To understand that sentence as, "I won't increase production without adding equipment" or "If you want me to increase production, you must first give me more equipment," is an excuse for condition-ists and is not worth learning from. Developing production depends on continuously improving tools, and improving and creating tools mainly depends on people to exert their enthusiasm and creativity. It is people who improve tools and create tools, not tools that dominate people. Therefore, ultimately, people are the decisive factor; but people's enthusiasm and creativity must be brought into play through the continuous improvement and creation of tools. Just like Sun Wukong without his golden cudgel, even if he has great abilities, he cannot use them.

### “善其事”和“利其器”

    “善其事”和“利其器”
    葛德
    小时候念书，听先生讲过“工欲善其事，必先利其器”。后来把别的都忘了，只是对这句话却还记得清楚。一是因为先生讲得通俗明白，他说：“要打算做好一件活计，就先要收拾好应用的工具，比方，你要劈柴，就要先磨快斧子。”二是因为生活的经验，也不断证实这个道理：捕鱼先要结网，割麦先要磨镰，纺线先要扎纺车……总之，我一直坚决相信这个道理。
    后来，生活的经验一多，对这句话就有了一些批判。我先就怀疑了“必先”两个字。觉得“必先”这两个字，有些忽视人的主观能动作用。也还有人把它过分的强调了，在战争中，出现过唯武器论，否认我们可以打败装备优良的敌人；在建设中也出现过唯条件论，否认我们可以多快好省地建设社会主义。可是事实却是：靠了人，我们用小米加步枪，消灭了武装到牙齿的敌人；靠了人，我们在一穷二白的国家里，来了一个一天等于二十年的大跃进。再同生活经验一联系：没有网也能用手摸鱼，没有镰也能用手拔麦，没有纺车也能用手捻棉线，于是明白了，人才是生产中的最积极的因素。这样一来，干劲大起来了，克服困难的精神增强了，做工作时手也甩得更开了。这确乎是一种精神的解放。
    但是不久，生活就又作了进一步的批判，我对那句话的理解，原来也还是浮浅的。先是听到了关于苏广铭的消息。苏广铭能够提前完成第一个五年计划，也提前完成了第二个五年计划，1958年的计划又跃了三跃，都决定在他不断地改进工具，也就是“利其器”。接着是农村里传来了“车子化”、“轴承化”等等农具改革运动的消息，这也是“利其器”，工作效率都是成倍的提高。这时，经验便又使我作了比较：
    摸鱼：一次只摸一个；手工网鱼：一网可收十多条；机船捕鱼：一网可得百十斤；
    拔麦：一人一天不过一亩；用镰割麦：一人一天割三亩；收割机割麦：一天数十亩；
    捻线：一人一天不过一两；手摇纺车：一人一天可纺一斤；用纺纱机：一人一班可纺一百八十公斤左右。
    用手摸鱼要比手工网鱼差的远，而手工网鱼比起机船捕鱼又差的远；拔麦子比用镰刀割慢的多，而镰刀割又比收割机慢的多；手捻线比手摇纺车纺线产量低的多，而手摇纺车比起纺纱机来产量又低的多。这岂不正是证明了：手工工具比徒手优越的多，而机械化又比手工工具优越的多；工具的作用真是不可忽视的啊！
    把人的主观能动性同工具的重大作用统一了起来，对“工欲善其事，必先利其器”这句话，才有了更深刻的理解。拿生产这件事来说吧：“善其事”，就是一方面要不断提高产量和质量，一方面又要不断减轻人的劳动强度，用镰刀割麦，就比用手拔麦“善”，用收割机割麦比用镰刀割就更“善”。“利其器”就是不断改进工具的意思。
  “利”的方法，一个是“改”：改良旧的；一个是“创”：创造新的。要想不断地“善”，就得不断地去“利”。一个“善”字，一个“利”字，都是要求人们发挥更大的能动作用，而不是否定人们的主观能动作用。把那句话理解成没有增加设备我就不去增加生产；或者要我增加生产就要先给我增添设备，那是唯条件论者的借口，不足为训的。发展生产要靠不断地改进工具，而改良和创造工具，主要又靠人去发挥积极性和创造性，是人改良工具和创造工具，而不是工具支配人，因此，归根到底人还是决定性的因素；但是人的积极性和创造性，却又要借工具的不断改进和新创才能发挥出来，只是赤手空拳，就好像孙悟空没有了金箍棒，即使有冲天本事，也是施展不出来的。
