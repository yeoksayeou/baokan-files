Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: General Huang Kecheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the military delegation of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Secretary of State Omar Oussedik.

　　At the banquet, General Huang Kecheng first expressed, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, his highest respect to the representatives of the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army and to the Algerian people who are fighting.

　　After outlining the glorious history of the Algerian people's long-term anti-colonialist struggle, General Huang Kecheng said that the Algerian National Liberation Army is now united with the people, resisting the French aggressor army, which is several times larger and equipped with modern weapons. This heroic struggle shows the world that the Algerian people are invincible and that they will surely drive the colonialists out of their territory.

　　General Huang Kecheng said that the French colonialists are currently engaged in a desperate struggle in Algeria. People all over the world know that the evil war waged by the French colonialists is supported by US imperialism. Countless outstanding sons and daughters of Algeria have been killed by the French invading army with weapons supplied by the United States. The insidious US imperialists are putting on a face of "sympathizers" in front of Algeria, with the aim of taking France's place and replacing it.

　　General Huang Kecheng finally said that the Algerian people's struggle is not isolated. All countries and people in the world who oppose imperialism sympathize with and support you. Six hundred million Chinese people stand with the Algerian people. The Chinese people, who have experienced a long anti-imperialist struggle and finally achieved victory, deeply understand from their own experience that a just struggle will surely win, and oppressed nations will surely be liberated. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Algerian people who are fighting for national independence.

　　Secretary of State Omar Oussedik said that just a month ago, my companions and I were still on the battlefield in Algeria. We know that we are soldiers fighting for freedom, and we are also shouldering the task we should accomplish of defeating all imperialisms. The Algerian fighters who are waging guerrilla warfare believe that they are not only fighting for Algerian independence, but also for defeating colonialism and imperialism in North Africa and Africa. He warned the imperialists that Algeria, North Africa and Africa are no longer Western aggression bases and strategic points. The Sahara in Algeria cannot become a French nuclear test site.

　　Secretary of State Omar Oussedik said that we hope that the African people and the Asian people will unite and make it a bastion of peace.

　　Before the banquet, General Huang Kecheng met with all members of the Algerian military delegation.

　　Attending tonight's banquet were General Peng Shaohui, General Li Juikui, General Wang Xinting, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Ouyang Wen, Rear Admiral Zhang Xuesi of the Navy and other generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　Also present at tonight's banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee Li Dequan.

　　Military attachés of various countries' embassies in China, as well as diplomatic officials from the embassies of Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, and Albania, also attended tonight's banquet.

    阿尔及利亚人民是不可战胜的
    六亿中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起
    黄克诚大将设宴欢迎阿尔及利亚军事代表团
    新华社29日讯　国防部副部长黄克诚大将今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎以奥马尔·乌西迪克国务秘书为首的阿尔及利亚共和国军事代表团。
    黄克诚大将在宴会上首先代表我国国防部和中国人民解放军全体官兵，向英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的代表们，向正在战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民，表示崇高的敬意。
    黄克诚大将概述了阿尔及利亚人民长期的反殖民主义斗争的光荣历史后说，现在阿尔及利亚民族解放军正同人民团结在一起，抗击着数倍于它的、用现代武器装备起来的法国侵略军。这一英勇的斗争向全世界表明，阿尔及利亚人民是不可战胜的，他们一定会把殖民主义者从自己的领土上赶出去。
    黄克诚大将说，法国殖民主义者目前正在阿尔及利亚进行着绝望的挣扎。全世界人民都知道，法国殖民者所进行的罪恶战争，是得到美帝国主义支持的。无数的阿尔及利亚优秀儿女，是被法国侵略军用美国供给的武器杀死的。居心险恶的美帝国主义者，却在阿尔及利亚面前，装出一副“同情者”的面孔，其目的不过是想取法国的地位而代之。
    黄克诚大将最后说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争不是孤立的，世界上一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都同情和支持你们。六亿中国人民是和阿尔及利亚人民站在一起的。经过长期反帝斗争、并最后取得胜利的中国人民，从自己的切身经验中深刻地体会到，正义的斗争必将胜利，被压迫的民族必将获得解放。我们深信：最后胜利一定属于为民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克国务秘书说，仅在一月以前，我的同伴和我们还在阿尔及利亚战场上。我们知道我们是为自由而战的战士，我们还担负着我们应该完成的战胜各帝国主义的任务。正在进行游击战争的阿尔及利亚战士们相信，他们并不仅仅为阿尔及利亚独立，而且为了战胜在北非的和非洲的殖民主义和帝国主义而战斗着。他警告帝国主义说，阿尔及利亚、北非和非洲，不再是西方的侵略基地和战略要点。阿尔及利亚的撒哈拉也不可能成为法国的原子试验场。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克国务秘书说，我们希望非洲人民和亚洲人民团结在一起，使它成为保卫和平的堡垒。
    在宴会以前，黄克诚大将接见了阿尔及利亚军事代表团的全体人员。
    出席今晚宴会的有彭绍辉上将、李聚奎上将、王新亭上将、刘志坚中将、萧向荣中将、曹里怀空军中将、欧阳文中将、张学思海军少将等中国人民解放军将领。
    出席今晚宴会的还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞和中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全。
    各国驻华使馆武官以及朝鲜、越南、蒙古、阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使馆外交官员也出席了今晚的宴会。
