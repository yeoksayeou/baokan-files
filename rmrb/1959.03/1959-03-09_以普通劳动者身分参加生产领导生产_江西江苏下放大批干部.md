Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th -- This year in Jiangxi Province, more than 13,000 cadres have been transferred to people's communes and factories as members or workers. Among them are more than 40 secretaries of prefectural and county committees, as well as some directors and party secretaries of departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee.

These transferred cadres have inherited the Party's fine traditions of maintaining close ties with the masses and working hard, living, eating, and laboring together with the masses, playing a good role among the people. Liu Jianhua, member of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and secretary of the Gannan District Party Committee, after becoming a member of the Yeping Commune in Ruijin County, an old revolutionary base area, participated in labor such as burning manure, shoveling turf, carrying pond mud, and plowing fields every day with the commune members. He would get up at five o'clock every morning to collect manure or help commune members with cleaning, and during breaks, he would read newspapers to the commune members or help the cooks by starting fires, washing rice, and cooking. Lai Yawen, Deputy County Head of Nankang County, went to the Chating Production Team of Tangjiang Commune as a member and the next day he joined the commune members in building a reservoir. He also mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations, manufacturing four sets of indigenous cranes and three indigenous trains, and often used breaks to read newspapers and talk about current events to the commune members. The commune members praised him, saying: "The Party's cadres are really good; they came to our team without arrogance, put down their airs to become members, and are highly motivated in production." Chen Yike, a representative of the National People's Congress and director of the Tubu People's Commune in Yongxiu County, was transferred to Zhoufang Brigade as a member and soon earned the title of "Good Commune Member."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th -- A large number of cadres in Jiangsu Province who are being transferred to factories and rural areas to work as workers or commune members are preparing to depart. The more than two thousand cadres who have already been transferred to factories and rural areas are with the masses as ordinary laborers, leading the masses to actively labor.

On the Grand Canal water conservancy construction site, the cadres of the Jingjiang General Team took turns being transferred down to be migrant workers. On February 19, Wang Yonggao, the head of the general team who was transferred to be a migrant worker, disregarded the wind and snow and slippery roads, and worked barefoot to reinforce the flood control dike. They and more than two thousand migrant workers worked together, overcoming the wind, snow, and cold, completing a flood control dike in one day and night that would have originally taken three days to complete. Pan Qin芳, Deputy Party Secretary of the Changzhou Minfeng Textile Factory, found the reason for the backwardness of production in the refined spinning C class after going to the workshop to be a worker. After Pan Qin芳 led the workers in the workshop to solve these problems, this class leapt to become a Red Banner class. Liu Yujia, Secretary of the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, was transferred to the Electrical Instrument Factory to work. Jiang Mingtang, an apprentice in the factory's hardware workshop, felt that the parts on the instruments were too small, making them uninteresting to make and uneasy at work. After learning about this situation, Liu Yujia explained to Jiang Mingtang the relationship between small screws and building the motherland, asked him to work with peace of mind, and personally taught him how to operate the lathe. With the help of Comrade Lao Liu, this young man who had just embarked on life understood the meaning of work and began to love his job. Others could turn 1,300 to 1,400 parts per shift, but he wanted to turn more than 1,700.

    以普通劳动者身分参加生产领导生产
    江西江苏下放大批干部
    据新华社南昌7日电　江西省今年已经有一万三千多名干部下放人民公社、工厂当社员或工人，其中有地委、县委书记四十多人，还有省人民委员会的一些厅、局长和党委书记。
    这些下放干部都继承了党的联系群众、艰苦奋斗的优良传统，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，在人民群众中起了良好的作用。中共江西省委委员、赣南区党委书记刘建华到老革命根据地瑞金县叶坪公社当社员后，天天和社员一起参加烧粪、铲草皮、挑塘泥和犁田等劳动。他每天早上五点钟就起床，出外拾粪或帮助社员打扫卫生，每逢休息时间，他就给社员们读报或去帮助炊事员烧火、洗米做饭。南康县副县长赖雅文到达唐江公社茶亭生产队当社员的第二天，就和社员一起去修水库。他还发动群众大搞技术革新，制造了四副土起重机、三辆土火车，并经常利用休息时间给社员们读报纸、讲时事。社员们赞扬他说：“党的干部实在好，来到我队不骄傲，放下架子当社员，生产积极干劲高。”全国人民代表大会代表、永修县涂埠人民公社主任陈翊科，下放到周坊大队当社员，不久就获得了“好社员”的称号。
    据新华社南京7日电　江苏省下放到工厂、农村当工人或社员的大批干部正整装待发。目前已经下放到工厂和农村的二千多名干部，都以普通劳动者的身份和群众一起，并且带领着群众积极劳动。
    在大运河水利工地上，靖江总队的干部们轮流下放当民工。2月19日，下放当民工的总队长王永高等不顾雨雪纷飞、天寒路滑，赤脚抢筑防洪堤。他们和二千多名民工一起，战胜了雨雪风寒，用一昼夜的时间完成了本来需要三天才能完成的一条防洪堤。常州民丰纺织厂党委副书记潘琴芳下车间当工人后，找出了精纺丙班生产落后的原因，潘琴芳领导车间工人解决了这些问题后，这个班一跃而为红旗班。中共苏州市委书记处书记刘裕嘉下放到电气仪表厂劳动，这个厂五金车间的徒工姜明堂，认为仪表上的零件太小，做起来不过瘾，工作不安心，刘裕嘉了解这一情况后，就向姜明堂讲解了小螺丝钉和建设祖国的关系，要他安心工作，并且自己到车床上教给他怎样操作。在老刘同志的帮助下，这个刚刚走向生活的小青年懂得了工作的意义，开始热爱自己的工作，别人一班能车一千三、四百只零件，他要车一千七百多只。
