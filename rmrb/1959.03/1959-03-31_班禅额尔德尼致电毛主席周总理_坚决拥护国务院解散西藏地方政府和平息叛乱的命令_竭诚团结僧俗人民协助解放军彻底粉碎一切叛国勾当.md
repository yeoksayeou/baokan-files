Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaincain, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, sent a cable to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou on the 29th, supporting the State Council's order to dissolve the local government of Tibet and quell the rebellion, as well as the proclamation of the Tibet Military Region. The cable reads as follows: To Premier Zhou, and please forward to Chairman Mao:

　　On behalf of myself and the vast number of monks, laity, and people of Tibet, I firmly support the State Council's order to dissolve the local government of Tibet and quell the rebellion. I support the proclamation issued by the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army.

　　The former local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper strata clique of Tibet have consistently obstructed and undermined the efforts made by the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people, and patriotic figures to thoroughly implement the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, consistently engaged in divisive and destructive conspiracies against national unity, and consistently opposed the Tibetan people's path towards a prosperous and happy socialist society through democratic reform. This is entirely a reactionary act that opposes and harms the interests of the Tibetan people and violates their wishes. The Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government have consistently been lenient towards these reactionary acts in the past, constantly educating them with great principles, patiently waiting, and giving them opportunities for repentance. However, the reactionary upper strata clique of Tibet has consistently remained obstinate, mistakenly believing that the central government of the powerful motherland was "weak" and the invincible People's Liberation Army was "deceptive." Last year, they supported and expanded the rebellious armed forces in Tibet, endangering the Tibetan people everywhere. Since March 10th of this year, they have kidnapped the Dalai Lama, murdered patriotic and progressive figures, and persecuted Tibetan cadres and workers, openly embarking on the criminal road of betraying the country and the people. They have also colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and on the night of March 19th, they launched a full-scale armed attack on the organs and troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. The crimes of the reactionary upper strata clique of Tibet show that they are traitors to the motherland, enemies of the Tibetan people, and scum of the Tibetan nationality. Their treacherous crimes are intolerable by national law and have already been resolutely opposed by the vast number of Tibetan people and patriotic figures. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet resolutely implemented the State Council's order and took military action to dissolve the local government of Tibet and quell the rebellion, which is entirely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and has therefore received increasingly widespread and enthusiastic support from the Tibetan people. On behalf of myself and the Tibetan monks, laity, and people, I hail the significant victories already achieved by the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

　　I express my deep sympathy and concern for the situation of the Dalai Lama, who has been kidnapped by reactionary rebels. I hope he can break free from the control of the reactionary rebels as soon as possible. During the period of his abduction, I fully accept the State Council's order for me to serve as the Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

　　I will make every effort to unite the monks, laity, and people of Tibet and all patriotic figures, and with full confidence, actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion and thoroughly crushing all the shameless treacherous conspiracies carried out by the reactionary upper strata clique of Tibet with the support of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the strong support of the 650 million people of all nationalities in the motherland, the Tibetan people and the People's Liberation Army will surely be able to quell the rebellion and build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet.

　　Long live the great motherland!
　　Long live the Communist Party of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in our country!

    班禅额尔德尼致电毛主席周总理
    坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令
    竭诚团结僧俗人民协助解放军彻底粉碎一切叛国勾当
    新华社30日讯　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞29日致电毛主席和周总理，拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令以及西藏军区的布告。电文如下：周总理并请转毛主席：
    我个人并代表西藏广大僧俗人民，坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的命令。拥护人民解放军西藏军区出示的布告。
    前西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，一贯阻挠和破坏中央人民政府、西藏人民和爱国人士为彻底实现和平解放西藏协议所作的努力，一贯进行分裂、破坏民族团结的阴谋活动，一贯反对西藏人民经过民主改革，走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。这完全是反对和损害西藏人民利益，违背西藏人民意愿的反动行为。中国共产党和中央人民政府对他们的这些反动行为，过去一贯宽大为怀，不断晓以大义，耐心等待，给他们以悔悟的机会。但西藏上层反动集团始终执迷不悟，反误以为强大祖国的中央“软弱”，无敌的人民解放军“可欺”。去年，他们支持和扩大了西藏的叛乱武装，到处危害西藏人民。今年3月10日以来，他们劫持达赖喇嘛，杀害爱国进步人士，迫害藏族干部和工人，公开地走上了叛国、叛人民的罪恶道路。并勾结帝国主义和蒋介石集团，在3月19日夜间，开始向人民解放军驻拉萨的机关和部队全面进行武装攻击。西藏上层反动集团的罪行，表明他们是祖国的叛徒，西藏人民的敌人，西藏藏族的败类。他们的叛国罪行，为国法所不容，而且已经遭到西藏广大人民和爱国人士的坚决反对。人民解放军驻西藏部队坚决执行国务院命令，为解散西藏地方政府和平息叛乱而采取的军事行动，完全符合西藏人民的利益，因而受到西藏人民愈来愈广泛、愈来愈热烈的拥护。我个人并代表西藏僧俗人民，欢呼人民解放军在平息叛乱中，已经取得的重大胜利。
    我为达赖喇嘛遭到反动叛乱分子劫持的处境，对他深表同情和关怀。我希望他能够早日摆脱反动叛乱分子的控制。在他被劫持期间，我完全接受国务院命令我担任西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员的工作。
    我将竭诚努力，团结西藏僧俗人民和一切爱国人士，满怀信心地积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱，彻底粉碎西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义和蒋介石集团支持下，所搞的一切无耻的叛国勾当。我深信，在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，在祖国六亿五千万各族人民的有力支援下，西藏人民和人民解放军一起，一定能平息叛乱，一定能建设起繁荣幸福的社会主义的新西藏。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
                      班禅　一九五九年三月二十九日
