    One: Ancient heroes are countable, but heroes are everywhere now; if you ask how many there are on the Hai River, please look at the stars in the sky.

    Two: Not afraid of the freezing cold, the heroes sweat hard in battle. Hard battle! Hard battle! We must make the dam as solid as a mountain.

    Three: Cars are as fast as the wind, machines roar loudly. Heroes make waves in the Bohai Sea, turning the Crystal Palace upside down.

    驯海英雄赞
    丁力
    一古代英雄可数，如今英雄到处有；要问海河有多少？请看满天星斗。
    二不怕地冻天寒，英雄挥汗苦战。苦战！苦战！要叫大坝稳如山。
    三车子快如风，机器轰隆隆。英雄闹渤海，闹翻水晶宫。
