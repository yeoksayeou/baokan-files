Xinhua News Agency, March 19th – Beijing is vigorously developing teacher training education and organizing in-service teacher training, actively cultivating and improving primary and secondary school teachers to meet the needs of the vigorous development of primary and secondary education.

In Beijing, on average, one in every six people is a middle school or primary school student. The ranks of primary and secondary school teachers have expanded fourfold compared to the time of liberation. To meet the needs of teacher growth and improvement, Beijing and its districts have generally established teacher training institutions, enabling 80% of the city's primary and secondary school teachers to participate in various studies this year. The number of higher normal and normal schools in the city has also increased from four in the past to twenty, with the number of students enrolled increasing by five and a half times compared to 1949.

Beijing's higher normal and normal schools are run under the principle of unified leadership, overall planning, and division of responsibilities between the city and the districts (counties). The city concentrates its efforts on running higher normal schools, while the districts (counties) are responsible for running ordinary normal schools well. In developing teacher training education, the suburban districts (counties) mostly adopt a gradual transition approach: first establishing normal classes in ordinary middle schools with better conditions, and then gradually expanding on the basis of the classes to establish normal schools. All districts (counties) attach great importance to normal schools, taking measures to ensure the enrollment numbers and teaching quality of these schools; in the spirit of diligence and frugality in running schools, they actively solve problems such as teachers, school buildings, and necessary equipment for these schools according to needs.

In organizing in-service teacher training, Beijing has adopted various methods. Currently, the Municipal Teacher Training College has organized five short-term rotational training classes, twelve teaching material and teaching method classes, four single-subject advanced study classes, and special lectures on politics, Chinese language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, Russian, English, fine arts, music, and physical education for middle school teachers; it has also organized broadcast correspondence courses in Chinese language and mathematics for primary school teachers. Municipal and district teacher training institutions determine different teaching content based on the different cultural and professional levels of teachers. Teachers with low professional levels and difficulties in teaching "learn what they teach"; teachers with some teaching experience but low cultural levels are systematically helped to improve their culture; teachers with more teaching experience and higher educational levels are helped to "supplement what they lack" and improve their political and theoretical level. Teacher training schools in Dongcheng, Haidian and other districts have also opened philosophy courses.

To ensure that teachers have sufficient study time, all middle and primary schools in Beijing include organizing teacher training in their work schedules and properly arrange their working hours.

    发展师范教育　组织教师进修
    北京积极培养中小学教师
    新华社19日讯　北京市大力发展师范教育和组织在职教师进修，积极培养和提高中小学教师，以适应中小学教育蓬勃发展的需要。
    北京市现在平均每六个人中就有一个中学生或小学生。中小学教师队伍比解放时扩大了四倍。为适应师资增长和提高的需要，目前，北京市和各区普遍建立了教师进修机构，使全市80％的中小学教师今年都可以参加各种学习。全市高等师范和普通师范学校，也从过去的四所增加到二十所，在校人数比1949年增加了五倍半。
    北京市高等师范和普通师范学校，是在统一领导，通盘筹划，市、区（县）分工负责的原则下举办的，市集中力量办高等师范，各区（县）负责办好普通师范。郊区各区（县）在发展师范教育中多采取逐步过渡的办法：先在条件较好的普通中学设立师范班，然后在班的基础上逐步扩大，成立师范学校。各区（县）对师范学校都很重视，采取措施保证这些学校的招生数量和教学质量；在勤俭办学的精神下，根据需要积极解决这些学校的师资、校舍和必要的设备等问题。
    在组织在职教师进修工作中，北京市采取了各种各样的办法。现在，市教师进修学院为中学教师举办了五个短期轮训班，十二个教材教法班，四个单科进修班和政治、语文、数学、物理、化学、生物、历史、俄语、英语、美术、音乐和体育等专题讲座；还为小学教师举办了语文、数学等广播函授课。市、区教师进修院校根据教师文化业务的不同情况，确定了不同的教学内容。业务水平低教课有困难的教师“教什么，学什么”；有一定教学经验，但文化水平较低的教师，就系统地帮助他们提高文化；教学经验较多、文化程度较高的教师，就帮助他们“缺什么，补什么”；并提高他们的政治理论水平。东城、海淀等区的教师进修学校还开设了哲学课。
    为保证教师有一定的学习时间，北京市各中、小学校都把组织教师进修列入工作日程，妥善地安排他们的工作时间。
