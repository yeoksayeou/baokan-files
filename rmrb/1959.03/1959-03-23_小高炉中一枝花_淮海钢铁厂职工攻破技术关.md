A Flower in the Small Blast Furnace
淮海 Steel Plant Workers Overcome Technical Hurdles
28 Cubic Meter Blast Furnace's Daily Pig Iron Production Stabilizes at Around 35 Tons

(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd dispatch) The Fifth Blast Furnace (28 cubic meters) of Jiangsu Province's Xuzhou 淮海 Steel Plant has recently undergone a series of reforms in operating techniques, management systems, and equipment usage. As a result, its daily pig iron production has consistently reached approximately 35 tons. On March 20th, the daily output reached 41 tons, and on the 21st, a new record of 43 tons was created.

The Fifth Blast Furnace of 淮海 Steel Plant was once a "sick furnace" with long-term low production. At the end of December last year, the average daily output was only a little over five tons. Before February 15th, the highest daily output only reached 21.93 tons. After February 15th, due to the bold use of large air volume operation experience, using methods to increase air pressure and increase air volume to fully utilize the potential of the entire blast furnace equipment, the daily production of pig iron immediately greatly increased, often stabilizing at a level of about 35 tons. The coke ratio decreased from 1.38 to 1.196; the average cost per ton of pig iron in February has been reduced to 201 yuan; and the quality of pig iron has also improved.

When the large air volume operation was first implemented, the factory Party organization mobilized the masses to debate in front of the furnace, and also convened relevant personnel to hold several forums, making full estimates of the problems that may be brought about by the implementation of this operation method. The Deputy Secretary of the Party General Branch and the Deputy Director of the factory personally took charge of the inspection and repair of equipment and the supply of raw materials, and also strengthened the leadership of production in front of the furnace. In the trial use of the new operation method, the workers found that the blower was heating up after increasing the air pressure due to the air inlet being blocked; after solving this problem, the air pressure was increased to 260 mmHg, and the blower was still operating normally. In this way, they increased the air pressure of No. 5 furnace from 140 to 200-230 mmHg, increasing the daily output to about 28 tons. Within half a month, the blower, air pipes, and furnace conditions were normal, and the output quality continued to rise.

In order to meet the requirements of the large air volume operation, No. 5 blast furnace has also made corresponding changes in raw material processing, operating techniques, and management. They conscientiously implemented the experience of "eat less, eat more frequently, and eat fine grains," improved the processing and operation methods of coke, and revised the charging system according to changes in blast furnace conditions.

    小高炉中一枝花
    淮海钢铁厂职工攻破技术关
    28立方公尺高炉日产生铁稳定在35吨左右
    本报南京22日电　江苏省徐州淮海钢铁厂第五号高炉（二十八立方公尺），最近在操作技术、管理制度、设备使用等方面作了一系列的改革以后，生铁的日产量已经常达到三十五吨左右。3月20日日产达到四十一吨，21日又创造了日产四十三吨的新纪录。
    淮海钢铁厂第五号高炉曾经是长期低产的“病号炉”，去年12月底平均日产量只有五吨多，2月15日以前，最高日产量也只达到二十一点九三吨。2月15日以后，由于大胆使用了大风操作的经验，用提高风压、增大风量的方法，充分发挥了高炉整个设备的潜力，生铁的日产量立即大大提高，经常稳定在三十五吨左右的水平。焦比则从一点三八下降为一点一九六；2月份平均每吨生铁的成本已降低为二百零一元；生铁的质量也有提高。
    在开始实行大风操作时，工厂党组织发动群众在炉前辩论，同时多次召集有关人员举行座谈会，对实行这种操作方法可能带来的问题，作了充分的估计。党总支副书记和副厂长亲自负责设备的检查修理和原料的供应，并且加强了炉前生产的领导。职工们在试用新操作方法中，发现鼓风机提高风压后发热是由于进风道不畅；在解决了这个问题以后，风压提高到二百六十个水银柱，鼓风机依旧运转正常。这样，他们便把五号炉的风压从一百四十提高到二百至二百三十个水银柱，使日产量增加到二十八吨左右。半个月内，鼓风机、风管子和炉况都正常，产量质量继续上升。
    为了适应大风操作的要求，五号高炉又在原料处理、操作技术和管理方面作了相应的变革。他们认真推行了“少吃、多吃、吃细粮”的经验，改进了焦炭的加工操作方法，并根据高炉条件的变化，修改了上料制度。
