Grasping the Key to Increased Sugar Production
Commentator of this newspaper

    With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards in our country, the consumption of sugar has greatly increased. China's sugar industry has developed rapidly, with sugar production in 1958 doubling that of 1952, but it still cannot meet the current needs of people's consumption growth. At the same time, sugar is also a raw material for the food and pharmaceutical industries, directly related to the production of these industries. Therefore, it is now necessary to seize the opportunity to increase sugar production.

    At present, the important link in increasing sugar production is to seize the time, take emergency measures, and process all existing sugar materials into sugar. In January and February of this year, sugar production in various regions has increased significantly, but because a portion of sugar materials were left over from the fourth quarter of last year to be processed in the first half of this year, the task of processing sugar materials this pressing season has increased a lot compared with previous years. The seasonality of sugar materials is very strong, so grasping the last month or so of this pressing season and processing the existing sugar materials into sugar is an urgent task for sugar enterprises.

    Recently, some regions have seized this work and achieved significant results. For example, in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, due to the strengthening of leadership by the provincial party committees and the establishment of a beet transportation headquarters, the difficulties in raw material transportation were resolved in a timely manner, ensuring the supply of sugar materials, and thus overfulfilling the state's sugar production plan. However, some regions have not yet taken active measures, and the speed of sugar production increase is not fast. Therefore, it is necessary to take immediate action, take emergency measures, and squeeze all existing sugar materials into sugar.

    First, key sugar-producing areas should be particularly focused on. The six southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi, which account for more than half of the country's sugarcane production, as well as the regions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia that produce sugar beets, are key sugar-producing areas. Whether these producing areas can complete their sugar material production plans has a great impact on the country as a whole, so they must be focused on. As for non-key sugar-producing areas, they are generally newly developed sugar material production areas in 1958. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to help newly built small sugar factories solve technical difficulties; on the other hand, the sugar beets that these small factories cannot handle should be transported to large factories for processing as soon as possible. Recently, Baotou Sugar Factory in Inner Mongolia has collaborated with Beijing, Hebei, and Shanxi to transfer and process sugar beets that cannot be handled, which is necessary.

    Second, it is necessary to carry out technological revolution, improve the processing capacity of existing large and medium-sized sugar factories, accelerate the processing of existing sugar materials, pay attention to safe production, and control sugar loss to increase production. Now, the mechanized sugar factories in Heilongjiang and Jilin have adopted concrete measures to address the weak links in production through high-yield competitions, improved process operations, and the implementation of rapid machine washing, which has generally increased the equipment capacity of large sugar factories by 50% to 70%. This proves that the potential of existing mechanized sugar factories is great. As long as the masses are mobilized to tap potential, processing capacity can be improved. While focusing on mechanized sugar factories, all localities should also strengthen leadership over indigenous sugar pressing. All small sugar factories should be appropriately staffed, strengthen management, carry out technological innovation, and actively promote advanced experiences to increase production.

    Another important link in increasing sugar production is to prepare for the sugar production season in the second half of the year. The sugar production season in the second half of the year will bear more than half of the year's sugar production tasks, which requires accelerating the sowing of sugar materials and arranging the capital construction of the sugar industry.

    This year's sugar material sowing plan has increased by nearly one time compared with last year. The sugar material sowing season is approaching, and all localities should sow appropriately early so that this year's sugar materials can be harvested earlier in the second half of the year, so that all sugar factories can start operations earlier. Large and medium-sized sugar factories should sign sugar material pre-purchase and supply contracts with communes to ensure the supply of sugar materials.

    In order to adapt to the rapid growth of sugar materials and vigorously increase sugar production, in addition to tapping the potential of existing sugar production equipment, it is also necessary to accelerate the construction of new sugar factories as stipulated in the national plan. This year, the newly added capacity of the sugar industry exceeds the sum of the original enterprises' production capacity. A considerable part of this year's sugar production plan depends on the completion of new sugar factories. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the newly built mechanized sugar factories can be put into production quickly. This year, the capacity of newly built small sugar factories will account for half of this year's newly added capacity, and all localities must assist these small factories in solving the difficulties in building factories.

    In order to better and more comprehensively complete the production and construction tasks of the sugar industry in 1959, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party committee over the sugar industry. All localities should check the implementation of the plan on a daily and ten-day basis, and do everything possible to increase sugar production, striving for a greater leap forward in the sugar industry.

    抓紧食糖增产的关键
    本报评论员
    随着我国工农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，食糖的消费量已大大增加。我国食糖工业发展很快，1958年食糖生产比1952年增长了一倍，但仍不能适应当前人民消费增长的需要。同时，食糖又是食品、医药工业的原料，直接关系着食品、医药工业的生产，因此，现在要抓紧增产食糖。
    目前增产食糖的重要环节是：抓紧时机，采取紧急措施，把现有糖料都加工成糖。今年1、2两月份各地食糖生产都有较大的增长，但由于去年第四季度留下了一部分糖料到今年上半年来加工，因此这一榨季的糖料加工任务比往年增加了很多。而糖料的季节性很强，因此抓紧这一榨季的最后一个多月，把现有的糖料加工成糖，是制糖企业的紧迫的任务。
    最近有些地区已抓紧这一工作，并取得了显著的效果。如黑龙江、吉林省，由于省委加强领导，专门成立了甜菜运输指挥部，及时解决原料运输的困难，保证了糖料供应，因而超额完成国家的食糖生产计划。但有些地区，还没有积极采取措施，食糖增产速度不快，因此需要立即行动起来，采取紧急措施，把现有糖料都榨出糖来。
    首先，重点产糖区要特别抓紧。占全国蔗糖产量一半以上的广东、广西、福建、云南、四川、江西等南方六省，以及黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等生产甜菜的地区，是重点产糖区。这些产区的糖料生产计划能否完成，对全国的影响很大，因此必须抓紧。至于非重点产糖地区，一般都是1958年新发展的糖料生产地区，因此，一方面要帮助新建的小糖厂解决技术上的困难；另一方面把这些地区的小厂处理不了的甜菜，尽速运送到大厂加工。最近内蒙古包头糖厂已经同北京、河北、山西协作，把处理不了的甜菜调运加工，这样作是必要的。
    其次，要开展技术革命，提高现有大中型糖厂的加工能力，加速处理现有的糖料，注意安全生产，控制糖份的损失，以增加产量。现在黑龙江、吉林各机制糖厂通过开展高产竞赛，改进工艺操作，推行快速洗机等办法，在生产薄弱环节采取了具体措施，使大型糖厂的设备能力一般提高50％到70％。这证明现有机制糖厂的潜力是很大的，只要发动群众，挖潜力，是可以提高处理能力的。在抓紧机制糖厂的同时，各地还要加强对土榨糖的领导。各小型糖厂，要适当配足劳力，加强管理，开展技术革新，积极推广先进经验，以提高产量。
    增产食糖的另一个重要环节，就是要为下半年制糖季节生产作好准备。下半年制糖季节要负担全年食糖生产任务的一半多，这就要求赶快抓糖料的播种，抓制糖工业基本建设的安排。
    今年糖料播种计划比去年增加将近一倍，糖料播种季节快到，各地要适当早播，使今年下半年糖料能提前收割，使各糖厂都能提早开工。各大中型糖厂要与公社签订糖料预购供应合同，以保证糖料供应。
    为了适应糖料的迅速的增长，大力增产食糖，除了要发挥现有制糖生产设备潜力外，还必须加速国家计划内规定的新糖厂的建设。今年制糖工业新增能力超过原有企业生产能力的总和。今年的食糖生产计划，有不少要依靠新建糖厂来完成。因此，必须保证新建的机制糖厂能迅速投入生产。今年新建小型糖厂的能力要占到今年新增能力的一半，各地必须协助这些小厂解决在建厂中的困难。
    为了更好的更全面的完成1959年制糖工业的生产建设任务，必须加强党委对制糖工业的领导，各地应该按日按旬的来检查计划的执行情况，千方百计地来增加食糖生产，力争制糖工业来一个更大的跃进。
