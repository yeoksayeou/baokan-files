Grasp the "Eight-Character Constitution" to Strive for High Agricultural Yields
Liaoning and Jilin Fully Invested in Spring Plowing and Production

(Our newspaper Shenyang, 11th) Liaoning Province, holding the lofty ambition of "vowing to double grain and cotton production, and ensuring self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables," has launched the prelude to the great agricultural leap forward movement of 1959 with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and filling the seas.

Currently, from the Liaohe Plain to the coast of the Yellow Sea, from outside the ancient Great Wall to the banks of the Yalu River, on the land where the cold snow is beginning to melt, people are rushing to accumulate fertilizer, transport manure, vigorously repair water conservancy facilities, hurry with spring irrigation and prepare the land to preserve moisture, fighting to win the first hurdle of the great agricultural leap forward—completing preparations for plowing and spring sowing quickly, early, and well.

The people of Liaoning have deeply realized from the experience and lessons of last year's great leap forward in agricultural production that taking revolutionary measures, resolutely changing the old farming habits of "wide ridges, shallow plowing, extensive planting and low yields," and comprehensively and conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a great leap forward in agriculture. Therefore, when the autumn harvest had not yet ended last year, the people of the province began working to realize this year's great leap forward in agriculture. Under the battle cry of "turning over the land first to achieve a great leap forward," people's communes organized millions of people into deep plowing armies. After more than forty days of hard work, they turned over more than 30 million mu of land, of which 19.5 million mu were deeply plowed more than one foot deep, and high-yield satellite fields were generally deeply plowed more than three feet deep, laying a good foundation for achieving high agricultural yield increases this year. Now, various places are leveling, harrowing, and compacting the deeply plowed land.

On average, each mu of cultivated land in the province already has more than 7,400 jin of farm manure and 28 jin of native fertilizer, exceeding last year's level of fertilization per mu. However, this manure and fertilizer is still not enough to meet the needs of this year's great leap forward in agriculture. Therefore, while rushing to transport manure, local fertilizer accumulation armies are continuing to seize the favorable opportunity before spring plowing to work hard and skillfully, striving to achieve the goal of applying 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to large areas of high-yield fields and 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to ordinary fields.

On the water conservancy front, based on the tremendous achievements already made in winter water conservancy projects, people's communes in various places, according to the provincial party committee's urgent instruction to "overcome the threat of spring drought and ensure timely sowing," are launching a high tide of water conservancy construction centered on storming through spring irrigation. While fighting hard on fertilizer and water, various places have also grasped the work of carefully selecting fine seeds.

A shortage of labor is a difficulty in realizing this year's great leap forward plan in agriculture. In order to solve this problem, various places are carrying out a large-scale tool reform movement. According to preliminary plans, the province will promote 4.77 million improved agricultural tools for power, transportation, land preparation, sowing, rice transplanting, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer application this year, striving to increase labor productivity by multiples.

(Our newspaper Changchun, 11th) Jilin Province is launching the first battle of this year's great leap forward in agriculture with a vigorous spring plowing preparation movement. This year, agricultural production throughout the province is comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution," gradually implementing the policy of high yield, less planting, and more harvesting, ensuring that on 62 million mu of planted area, grain and soybeans will increase by more than 70% compared to last year.

The experience of last year's great leap forward in agriculture and the great achievements of people's communeization have not only enabled the people of the province to find the correct direction for a great leap forward in agriculture, but also have created an unprecedented scale of current spring plowing preparation work on a new foundation. As of the end of February, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and fertilizer transportation throughout the province has reached more than 2 million, accounting for more than 50% of the province's rural labor force. The total amount of accumulated fertilizer has reached more than 230 million tons, equivalent to 2.4 times the total amount of fertilizer applied to cultivated land throughout the province last year, and the quality has also exceeded last year. More than 20,000 native fertilizer plants have been built throughout the province, producing more than 680,000 tons of native fertilizer and 7,600 tons of bacterial fertilizer.

Due to scarce rain and snow this winter and spring, in order to ensure timely sowing, various places have carried out land preparation and moisture preservation work in advance. Various communes have also launched a rapid water conservancy movement focusing on exploiting groundwater; and are preparing to deeply plow a portion of the cultivated land again in the spring, so that deeply plowed land accounts for more than 80% of the planted area; implementing various drought-resistant sowing methods such as timely early sowing, topsoil sowing, and water-assisted sowing, determined to overcome the spring drought.

According to the requirements of dense planting, various places throughout the province have selected and retained more than 460,000 tons of various crop seeds to meet the needs of spring sowing. The number of draft animals in the province has also increased by more than 34,000 heads compared to the end of 1957. The spring plowing preparation competition movement of various people's communes, which began after the Spring Festival, has rapidly developed in Yongji, Panshi, Yushu, Hailong, Jiaohe, Linjiang, Da'an and other counties. Jiaohe County, one of the high-yield agricultural counties in Jilin Province, has issued a revolutionary friendship competition proposal to all counties and cities in the province to carry out a comprehensive great leap forward in agricultural production, challenging with targets of 1,100 jin of grain per mu and 340 jin of soybeans per mu. The province-wide competition movement is in full swing. (Cheng Yu, Jin Changfan)

### 抓“八字宪法”争农业高产  辽宁吉林全力投入春耕生产

    抓“八字宪法”争农业高产
    辽宁吉林全力投入春耕生产
    本报沈阳11日电　辽宁省抱定“誓争粮棉翻番，确保粮菜自给”的凌云大志，以移山填海的英雄气概，揭开了1959年农业大翻身运动的序幕。
    目前，从辽河平原到黄海之滨，从古长城外到鸭绿江畔，在冷雪初融的大地上，人们正在突击积肥、送粪，大修水利，赶忙春灌和整地保墒，为拿下农业大翻身的第一关——又快又早又好地完成备耕和春耕播种而战。
    辽宁人民从去年农业生产大跃进的经验和教训中，深深地体会到：采取革命措施，坚决改变“宽垅浅耕，广种薄收”的老一套耕作习惯，全面认真地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，是实现农业大翻身的根本保证。因此，当去年秋收还未结束的时候，全省人民便为实现今年农业大翻身开始工作。在“翻身先翻地”的战斗口号下，各人民公社组织了几百万深翻大军，经过四十多天的苦战，使三千多万亩土地翻了身，其中有一千九百五十万亩深翻一尺以上，高产卫星田普遍深翻三尺以上，为今年实现农业高额增产打下了良好的基础。现在各地正对深翻的土地进行平整、耙压工作。
    全省平均每亩耕地已有农家肥料七千四百多斤、土化肥二十八斤，已超过去年每亩耕地的施肥水平。但是这些粪肥还不能满足今年农业大翻身的需要。因此，各地积肥大军在一面突击送粪，一面继续抓紧春耕前的有利时机大干巧干，向每亩大面积丰产田施肥三万斤、普通田施肥一万斤的目标奋勇前进。
    水利战线上，各地人民公社在冬修水利工程已取得巨大成绩的基础上，根据省委“战胜春旱威胁，保证适时播种”的紧急指示，正在开展一个以突击春灌为中心的水利建设高潮。在大战肥、水的同时，各地都抓紧了精选良种的工作。
    实现今年农业大翻身的跃进规划，劳动力不足是一个困难。为了解决这一问题，各地大规模开展工具改革运动。根据初步计划，全省今年将推广动力、运输、整地、播种、插秧、水利施工和积肥追肥等各种改良农具四百七十七万件，力争成倍地提高劳动生产率。　　　（高方）
    本报长春11日电　吉林省正以轰轰烈烈的备耕运动，展开今年农业大翻身的首次战役。今年，全省农业生产正全面贯彻“八字宪法”逐步实行高产、少种、多收的方针，保证在六千二百万亩播种面积上，粮食、大豆比去年增产70％以上。
    去年农业大跃进的经验和人民公社化的巨大成就，不仅使全省人民找到了农业大翻身的正确方向，而且在新的基础上使当前备耕工作出现了空前未有的规模。截至2月底，全省参加积肥，造肥，送肥的人数已达二百多万人，占全省农村劳动力50％以上。积肥总量已达到两亿三千多万吨，等于去年全省耕地施肥总量的二点四倍，质量也超过去年。全省已建成土化肥厂两万多个，制出土化肥六十八万多吨，菌肥七千六百多吨。
    去冬今春雨雪稀少，为了保证适时播种，各地都提前进行整地保墒工作。各公社还开展以挖掘地下水为主的速效水利运动；并准备春季再深翻一部分耕地，使全省深翻地占播种面积的80％以上；实行适时早种，顶浆播种、坐水种等各种抗旱播种方法，决心战胜春旱。
    根据密植要求，全省各地已选留各种作物种籽四十六万多吨，满足春播需要。全省役畜也比1957年年底以前增加了三万四千多头。从春节以后开始的各人民公社的备耕竞赛运动，已在永吉、磐石、榆树、海龙、蛟河、临江、大安等县迅速开展起来。吉林省农业高产县之一的蛟河县，已向全省各县、市发出开展农业生产全面大跃进的革命友谊竞赛倡议书，以亩产粮食一千一百斤，亩产大豆三百四十斤的指标进行挑战。全省性的竞赛运动正在热烈地进行着。
