Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 7th. Khrushchev said at a reception in Leipzig on the 6th that a German peace treaty would end the remnants of World War II. At the same time, the so-called Berlin problem will also be resolved, because after the conclusion of a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, the occupation regime in West Berlin will be eliminated, and then an environment of peace and tranquility will be established throughout Berlin.

He also said that if the state of war can be stopped and peaceful relations established, then the decisions concerning the occupation of Berlin during and after the war will automatically become invalid. West Berlin will have the practical possibility to develop and prosper as a free city. This is our past proposal, and it is also a firm demand we are making to our former allies now.

The reception was held by the Soviet Embassy for Khrushchev's visit to Leipzig. Among the leaders of the German Democratic Republic who attended the reception were Grotewohl, Ulbricht, Dieckmann, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Lehmann.

Khrushchev said at the reception that we have stated more than once in the past, and we still state now, that if West Germany and its allies refuse to conclude a peace treaty, then we will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, if it agrees to do so.

It is quite clear that other countries that participated in defeating the Hitlerite bandits and correctly understand the significance of this major step will sign this treaty with the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that only those who have lost the ability to make a sober assessment of the situation would insist on the view that a German peace treaty can only be concluded after Germany is reunified. Khrushchev pointed out that the fact is that there are currently two independent Germanys. The issue of restoring German unity cannot be resolved mechanically. The Four Powers, or even all the countries that fought against Hitler's Germany, cannot solve this problem. If they were to intervene in solving this problem, it would be a deliberate interference in the internal affairs of the Germans. Therefore, the claim that German reunification can be achieved through external interference is an absurd claim.

Khrushchev then said that we believe that the proposal made by the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys is wise, and we fully support this proposal. Implementing this proposal would make it possible to solve the various problems that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany hope to solve. Khrushchev also spoke about his impressions of the Leipzig Trade Fair. He said that the Leipzig Spring Fair is a good example of practical cooperation between people and between countries, regardless of their social systems. He also said that all those who visit the Leipzig Trade Fair can see the significant economic achievements of the socialist camp countries and the broader possibilities for them to develop international trade on a mutually beneficial basis. For example, during the fair alone, as a result of the successful and friendly negotiations between Soviet trade organizations and trade organizations of the German Democratic Republic, it was decided to purchase various equipment worth more than 400 million rubles from the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev said that in addition to the foreign trade organizations of socialist countries, more than 2,800 companies from capitalist countries are participating in this year's Spring Fair. This proves that business people in these countries are very willing to do business with socialist countries. For example, among the capitalist countries' companies participating in the fair, 177 companies currently have business relations with Soviet foreign trade organizations.

Khrushchev said: "The development of trade between countries has always been a barometer of the improvement and deterioration of relations between countries. If we look at this barometer now, then the needle on the table is clearly pointing towards improvement." He then cited many figures to prove the strengthening of Soviet trade with many European countries.

Khrushchev said that Soviet trade with capitalist countries has more than doubled in the last five years. As long as the West does not create artificial obstacles, our trade with capitalist countries can develop even further.

Khrushchev pointed out that the policy of trade embargoes against socialist countries pursued by Western governments has gone bankrupt. This policy has caused even greater damage to the countries that are implementing it. More far-sighted business people and economists have understood in the past that this policy is absurd.

Khrushchev said that anyone who adopts an ostrich policy, obstructs the development of economic relations with socialist countries, and hopes to change the laws of social development in this way, their policy will first and foremost bring losses to their own country. Everyone is very clear that if the Soviet Union, for example, were to develop trade with the United States, it would increase the employment rate of American residents. According to American statistics, there are now approximately five million unemployed people in the United States. US Secretary of Commerce Strauss must take the fate of these people into consideration.

Khrushchev said that capitalism, which disregards the interests of hundreds of millions of people, is increasingly losing prestige in the hearts of the people. People will increasingly conclude that capitalism prevents them from guaranteeing their survival and the survival of their families. The danger for capitalism lies in this, and not in the fact that trade with us will strengthen communism.

Khrushchev then said that if these or those countries or companies want to obtain new large orders from us in order to increase the load on their own industries and the employment of workers, then we can offer these orders on the condition that they give us loans. I think business people understand this. Please believe that we always fulfill our obligations. Businessmen, trade is a voluntary matter. If you are unwilling to provide us with loans, if you do not have this need, then you do not do so. We will not force it.

Grotewohl also spoke at the reception. He said that Khrushchev's visit gives the Leipzig Trade Fair particularly outstanding significance. His visit is a visit to strengthen the close and unbreakable unity and deep friendship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. His visit eloquently demonstrates the firm will of the Soviet Union to safeguard and maintain peace.

Grotewohl said that the German Democratic Republic is exhibiting many new products from various sectors of industry and agriculture at this Leipzig Spring Fair. Now, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are making every effort to complete our country's main economic task on time—to catch up with West Germany in terms of per capita major consumer goods by 1961. They are fully confident that the Soviet Union and the entire great socialist camp stand by them in safeguarding and maintaining the political, economic, social, and cultural achievements of the first worker-peasant Germany from the sabotage of all enemies.

Grotewohl said that our socialist construction, like the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan, requires a peaceful environment. However, fourteen years have passed since the end of the war, and still no German peace treaty has been concluded. Hitler's state of war has not yet been eliminated.

Grotewohl said that the proposal to hold negotiations for the conclusion of a German peace treaty is gaining increasing recognition. Not only the German people, but also all peace-loving people in the world feel the urgent need to eliminate the root causes of tension in West Germany and West Berlin.

Grotewohl said that concluding a German peace treaty is in the interests of the German people and in the interests of world peace. The task of thoroughly and peacefully resolving the German problem can and should be resolved. No one can obstruct us from doing so, no matter what obstacles they create. We declare: We will never allow Adenauer to block our path to a peace treaty—a path that the people of many countries are willing to take with us.

### 赫鲁晓夫在苏联驻德大使馆招待会上说  签订对德和约柏林问题也将解决  格罗提渥表示决不许阿登纳阻挠德国人民签订和约

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联驻德大使馆招待会上说
    签订对德和约柏林问题也将解决
    格罗提渥表示决不许阿登纳阻挠德国人民签订和约
    新华社来比锡7日电　赫鲁晓夫6日在来比锡的一次招待会上说，对德和约将结束第二次世界大战的残余。同时，所谓柏林问题也将得到解决，因为在同德意志民主共和国缔结和约以后，西柏林的占领制度将消除，那时，一个和平与安宁的环境将在整个柏林建立起来。
    他又说，要知道，如果战争状态能够停止，和平关系得以建立，那么在战争时期和战后时期关于占领柏林的决定将自行失效。西柏林将获得实际可能作为自由城市而发展和繁荣，这就是我们过去的建议，也是我们现在向自己过去的盟国所坚决提出的要求。
    这次招待会是由苏联大使馆为赫鲁晓夫访问来比锡而举行的。出席招待会的德意志民主共和国领导人有格罗提渥、乌布利希、狄克曼和德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼等。
    赫鲁晓夫在招待会上讲话说，我们过去不止一次地声明过，而且现在还声明，如果西德及其盟国拒绝缔结和约，那么我们将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，如果它同意这样做的话。
    十分明显，曾参加击溃希特勒匪帮而又正确地理解这一重大步骤意义的其他国家，将同苏联一起签订这项和约。
    赫鲁晓夫说，只有那些对局势失去清醒估计能力的人才会坚持这样的见解：只有在德国恢复统一后，才能缔结对德和约。赫鲁晓夫指出，要知道，目前存在着两个独立的德国，这是事实。恢复德国统一的问题不能用机械的方式来解决。四大国或者甚至所有曾经对希特勒德国作战的国家都不能解决这个问题。如果它们要插手解决这个问题，那么这就是蓄意干涉德国人的内政。因此，通过外来干涉来实现恢复德国统一的主张是一种荒谬的主张。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们认为，德意志民主共和国政府提出的关于建立两个德国的邦联的建议是明智的，我们完全支持这个建议。实现这个建议就有可能解决德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国所希望解决的各项问题。赫鲁晓夫还谈到了对来比锡博览会的印象。他说，来比锡春季博览会是人与人之间、国与国之间，不管社会制度如何，实行事务合作的很好的范例。他还说，所有参观来比锡博览会的人都可以看到，社会主义阵营国家重大的经济成就和它们能在互利的基础上发展国际贸易的更广泛的可能性。例如，光在博览会期间，苏联的贸易机构同德意志民主共和国的贸易机构进行圆满友好谈判的结果，就决定将向德意志民主共和国购买总值四亿卢布以上的各种设备。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在今年的春季博览会上，除了社会主义国家的对外贸易组织以外，还有资本主义国家的两千八百多个公司参加。这证明这些国家的实业界人士很愿意同社会主义国家做生意。譬如，在参加博览会的资本主义国家公司中，同苏联对外贸易组织现在有事务关系的有一百七十七个公司。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“国与国之间贸易的发展一直是国与国之间关系改善和恶化的晴雨表。如果现在看一看这个晴雨表，那么，表上的针显然是指向改善方面的。”他接着举出许多数字来证明苏联同许多欧洲国家贸易的加强。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联同资本主义国家的贸易最近五年来增加了一倍以上。只要西方不制造人为的障碍，我们同资本主义国家的贸易就能有更大的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西方国家政府对社会主义国家实行的贸易抵制的政策已经破产了。这个政策给那些在执行这种政策的国家带来更大的损害。比较有远见的实业界人士和经济学家过去就了解这种政策是荒谬的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，凡是将奉行鸵鸟政策，阻挠同社会主义国家发展经济关系，指望这样改变社会发展规律的人，他们的这种政策首先将给本国带来损失。每个人都很清楚，苏联如果，比方说，同美国发展贸易，就会提高美国居民的就业率。据美国的统计，现在美国大约有五百万失业者。美国商务部长斯特劳斯先生必须考虑到这些人的命运。
    赫鲁晓夫说，置千百万人的利益于不顾的资本主义在人民的心目中日益威信扫地。人们将越来越多地得出结论：资本主义使他们无法保证他们的生存和他们家庭的生存。对资本主义说来，危险就在于此，而不在于同我们贸易就会加强共产主义。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，如果这些或那些国家或公司想要从我们这里获得新的大量订货，以便增加自己工业的负荷和工人的就业，那我们可以在给我们贷款的条件下提出这些订货。我想，实业界人士都是明白这一点的。请相信，我们永远是履行自己的义务的。实业家先生们，贸易是自愿的事情，如果你们不愿意向我们提供贷款，如果你们没有这个需要，那你们就不这样做吧。我们不会强求的。
    格罗提渥在招待会上也讲了话。他说，赫鲁晓夫的访问使来比锡博览会具有特别突出的意义。他的访问是一次加强苏联同德意志民主共和国亲密无间的团结和深厚友谊的访问。他的访问雄辩地证明了苏联维护和保障和平的坚决意志。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国在这次来比锡春季博览会上展出了工农业各个部门的许多新产品。现在，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民正全力以赴地来按时完成我国的主要经济任务——在1961年以前，在按人口平均计算的主要消费品方面赶上西德。他们完全相信，在保障和维护第一个工农德国的政治、经济、社会和文化成果免受一切敌人阴谋破坏方面，苏联和整个伟大的社会主义阵营站在他们这一边。
    格罗提渥说，我国的社会主义建设正像苏联宏伟的七年计划一样，需要一个和平的环境。然而，在战争结束以后过去了十四年，现在仍然没有缔结对德和约。希特勒的战争状态还没有消除。
    格罗提渥说，关于举行缔结对德和约谈判的主张日益得到承认。不仅德国人民，而且世界全体爱好和平的人民都感到迫切需要消除西德和西柏林的紧张局势的根源。
    格罗提渥说，缔结对德和约既符合德国人民的利益，也符合世界和平的利益。彻底和平解决德国问题的任务能够、而且应该得到解决。无论任何人制造任何障碍都不能阻挠我们这样做。我们声明：我们决不允许阿登纳堵塞我们走向和约的道路——许多国家的人民愿意同我们一起走的道路。
