    Beijing, March 22nd, Xinhua News Agency - The survey work for the Shahe to Zhengzhou section and the preliminary survey work for the Zhengzhou to Beijing section of the (North) Beijing-Guangzhou Grand Canal, one of the routes for the South-to-North Water Diversion project, has recently begun.
    The survey team consists of relevant departments from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Ministry of Communications, and the provinces of Hebei and Henan, as well as the city of Beijing.
    This time, further measurements and geological explorations will be conducted on the selected route of the Beijing-Guangzhou Grand Canal from Shahe, a tributary of the Huai River, to Zhengzhou. For the Zhengzhou to Beijing section, a more detailed preliminary survey will be conducted along the three proposed routes than last year, along with some topographic surveying work.
    After this Grand Canal is opened in the future, it will draw water northward to supply irrigation to vast areas along the route and become a major north-south transportation artery parallel to the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. Hydropower stations can also be built along the route by utilizing the drop in elevation.

    京广运河开始勘测
    新华社郑州22日电　南水北调线路之一的（北）京广州大运河沙河到郑州段的勘测工作和郑州到北京段的查勘工作，已在最近开始。
    勘测的队伍，由黄河水利委员会、交通部和河北、河南两省及北京市的有关部门组成。
    这次是对京广大运河从淮河支流沙河到郑州段已经选定的线路，作进一步的测量和地质勘探。郑州到北京段，是沿已经提出的三条比较线路再做一次比去年细致的查勘，并做一些地形测量工作。
    这条大运河将来开通以后，将会引水北上，供给沿线广大地区灌溉，并成为沟通我国南北、同京广铁路相平行的航运大动脉。沿线还可利用落差建设水电站。
