    The CCP Hunan Chaling County Party Secretary An Xiang, the Industrial and Transportation Department Minister Zhang Shuchun, and the County Coal Bureau Director Luo Yongxiang came to the Donghu Coal Mining Area of the Limin Iron Factory. As soon as they arrived at the mining area, they changed into work clothes, put on safety helmets, and went down the mine with the workers to participate in production.

    The tunnel was very deep, three li long, with ninety-four production workers divided into nine working faces to mine coal. After entering the working face, Comrade An Xiang picked up a coal hoe and started digging coal.

    When the workers saw the responsible comrades of the County Party Committee coming down to the coal mine to participate in production, each one of them beamed with joy and felt no restraint whatsoever. Comrade An Xiang chatted with them, and everyone opened up. They talked about everything: the management of the coal area, production achievements, experiences and lessons learned, the problems existing in the lives and production of the workers, suggestions for production, and so on. The cadres quickly became familiar with the workers and quickly learned a lot about the situation.

    The cadres' participation in production greatly boosted the workers' production enthusiasm. On this day, the output of the entire mining area increased from 110 tons per day to 150 tons.

    县委书记下井挖煤
    中共湖南茶陵县委书记安祥、工业交通部部长张树春和县煤炭局局长罗永祥等到利民铁厂东湖采煤工区来了。他们一到工区，就换上工作服，戴着安全帽，下井和工人们一道参加生产。
    窿洞很深，有三华里长，九十四个生产工人分九个壋头采煤。进到壋头以后，安祥同志就拿起挖锄挖煤。
    工人们见县委负责同志下煤井参加生产，一个个笑逐颜开，一点儿拘束也没有，安祥同志找他们攀谈，大家都把话匣子打开了。煤区的经营管理啦、生产成绩、经验教训啦，职工生活、生产中存在的问题啦，对生产的建议啦……，什么都谈。干部很快地和工人熟悉起来，并且一阵子就了解了很多情况。
    干部参加生产，对工人们的生产情绪鼓舞很大。这一天，全工区产量由日产一百一十吨上升到一百五十吨。
