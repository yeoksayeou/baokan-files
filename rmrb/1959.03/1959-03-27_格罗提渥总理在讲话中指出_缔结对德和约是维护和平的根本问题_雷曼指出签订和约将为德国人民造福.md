Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 24th: According to newspaper reports, Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, stated in a speech at a meeting in Berlin with scientific and cultural workers, technical experts, and representatives of workers from major enterprises in Berlin, that the current international situation is characterized by the major peace initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries. The Soviet proposals on concluding a German peace treaty and resolving the Berlin issue have determined the nature of discussions in international public opinion, and have even forced stubborn enemies to study these proposals.

Grotewohl pointed out that concluding a German peace treaty is the fundamental issue in the struggle to maintain peace. Referring to Adenauer’s statement that a German peace treaty could only be concluded after Germany was reunified, Grotewohl emphasized that the Bonn government has closed the path to concluding a treaty with a reunified Germany. If the Western countries and Bonn continue to treat the proposal for a German peace treaty with a negative attitude as before, then the German Democratic Republic will conclude the treaty. This would mean that all occupation rights in the German Democratic Republic would lose their validity, and thus the occupation rights in West Berlin would also cease to exist, because Berlin is an integral part of the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is willing to guarantee that West Berlin becomes a free city, guaranteeing this city peaceful living conditions and unimpeded communication with the outside world.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 24th: According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency on the 24th, Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, made a statement to a reporter from the Hungarian News Agency on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty, saying that the Soviet proposal for a German peace treaty has aroused great interest among the people of West Germany, and a wide range of workers, farmers, and intellectuals are discussing this proposal. The vast majority of the German people recognize that the purpose of the Soviet draft peace treaty is to achieve peaceful political and economic development for both parts of Germany. Workers and intellectuals alike support the conclusion of the treaty, because only in this way can West Germany be freed from the pressure of militarism and fascism.

Lehmann said that the signing of a German peace treaty would benefit the German people and the people of Europe, and the realization of the treaty would provide the possibility of guaranteeing true peace. He also said that the Soviet proposal greatly contributes to the reunification of Germany.

He said that we must not forget that the forces of fascism in West Germany are growing stronger and are attempting to establish a fascist dictatorship, but their goal will not be realized. They have banned the activities of the Communist Party and the Peace Committee, but this is in vain, because they cannot stop the German people's struggle for peace and against atomic armament.

Lehmann said that our party has been banned repeatedly since 1918, but the party still exists; it lives in the hearts of the people, in the hearts of every German who desires peace and democracy. Our party is carrying out a difficult struggle underground, but the party's publications and newspapers are still published regularly. West German residents are increasingly strongly demanding the resumption of the Communist Party's public activities, and the vast majority of the working masses recognize that the Communist Party represents the truth, and believe that without the Communist Party, the German question cannot be resolved.

    格罗提渥总理在讲话中指出
    缔结对德和约是维护和平的根本问题
    雷曼指出签订和约将为德国人民造福
    新华社柏林24日电　据报纸报道：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在柏林的科学和文化工作者、技术知识界和柏林各大企业劳动者代表会议上讲话时说，当前国际局势的特点是苏联、德意志民主共和国和其它社会主义国家提出重大的和平倡议。苏联关于缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题的建议，决定了国际舆论界讨论的性质，甚至迫使顽固的敌人也不得不研究这些建议。
    格罗提渥指出，缔结对德和约是维护和平斗争中的根本问题。在谈到阿登纳关于只有在德国重新恢复统一后才能缔结对德和约的说法时，格罗提渥强调指出，波恩政府封闭了通向同恢复了统一的德国缔结和约的道路。如果西方国家和波恩仍然像从前一样以否定的态度对待缔结对德和约的建议，那么，德意志民主共和国将缔结和约。这会意味着，在德意志民主共和国的一切占领权利都将失去自己的效力，从而使西柏林的占领权利也不复存在，因为柏林是德意志民主共和国不可分割的部分。
    格罗提渥指出，德意志民主共和国愿意保证西柏林成为自由市，保证这个城市有和平生活条件和同外界的联系畅通无阻。
    新华社布达佩斯24日电　据匈牙利通讯社24日报道：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼就缔结对德和约问题向匈牙利通讯社记者发表谈话说，苏联提出的缔结对德和约的建议在西德人民中间引起了极大的兴趣，广大的工人、农民和知识分子都讨论这一建议。绝大多数德国人民都认识到苏联提出的对德和约草案的目的是为了德国的两部分在政治上和经济上得到和平的发展。工人和知识分子都赞同缔结和约，因为只有这样，西德才能摆脱军国主义和法西斯化的压力。
    雷曼说，对德和约的签订将会给德国人民和欧洲人民造福，和约的实现将为保障真正的和平提供可能性。他又说，苏联的这个建议大大有助于德国的重新统一。
    他说，我们不能忘记，西德的法西斯分子的势力愈来愈大，并正在企图建立法西斯专制，但是他们的这个目的是不会实现的。他们禁止共产党以及和平委员会的活动，但这是枉费心机的，因为他们无法制止德国人民为和平和反对原子武装而进行的斗争。
    雷曼说，我们党从1918年以来，一再被禁止活动，但是党还存在着，它活在人民的心中，活在每个要求和平和民主的德国人民的心中。我们的党在地下进行着艰巨的斗争，但是党的刊物和报纸还经常出版。西德居民愈来愈强烈地要求重新恢复共产党的公开活动，劳动群众的绝大多数认识到共产党是代表真理的，并且认为，如果没有共产党，德国问题是无法解决的。
