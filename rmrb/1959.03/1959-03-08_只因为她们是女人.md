    Just Because They Are Women
    Su Lan
    In a clothing factory, male and female workers sit face to face. They use the same machines, sewing the same clothes. When the day's work is over, the women receive a pound in wages from the boss, but the male workers get one pound and eight shillings.
    A female worker in the factory, Sima Fu, told me that she started learning tailoring at the age of fourteen and has been working hard in the clothing industry for thirty-nine years; in terms of skills, she is considered first-rate. But her salary is not as high as that of a greenhorn just entering the factory. The reason is simple: because she is a woman.
    Women, despite working no worse than men, do not receive the same wages as men. In Britain, this seems to be a matter of course, something to be taken for granted. It is like an invisible law, forbidding anyone to violate it.
    In many factories in the Southall district near London, female workers account for 50%. Here, some of the most skilled female workers earn the same wages as the lowest-level male workers. For a long time, they have been fighting to earn one more penny than these male workers. However, they have never been able to break through this barrier. In the eyes of capitalists, a penny's difference is nothing, but if female workers' wages are higher than male workers', the system of "unequal pay for equal work" will be shaken. Their profits are also in danger of decreasing. A worker put it well: "If equal pay for equal work is implemented, why would capitalists hire female workers? There are plenty of unemployed male workers now!"
    According to statistics, the minimum wage for female workers in Britain is about 75% of the minimum wage for male workers. In reality, the average amount of money women take home is only 58% of that of male workers.
    In order to strengthen the exploitation of women, capitalists divide each industry into "men's work" and "women's work." That is to say, some jobs with higher technical requirements are only allowed for men, and women are not allowed to intervene. They cannot become typesetters, carpenters, bricklayers, drivers... It is even stranger that a woman can bake all kinds of fragrant bread in her own kitchen, but she cannot be a baker in a bakery. In the clothing industry, female workers account for 80%, but they are not qualified to be cutters. The secret of this "division of labor" is that capitalists only need to equip a few skilled male workers to massively exploit cheap female labor.
    Dividing work into "men's work" and "women's work" is actually without any reason. It has only one purpose: to suppress the wages of female workers. In the Southall district I visited, there is a radio factory. Installing the wires of the radio is a very delicate job, which not only requires high skills but also requires a pair of dexterous hands. Women are more competent than men in doing this job. The capitalists take advantage of this point and call this job "women's work." In recent years, the work of female workers in this factory has become more and more heavy, and the technical requirements have become higher and higher. But when the female workers asked for a wage increase, the capitalists' answer was: "This is originally the work done by women. Since it is women's work, it cannot get men's wages."
    In order to expand this differential treatment, technical worker training classes in many industries are closed to women. Even if women have learned a lot of skills in long-term labor, they are not allowed to take on men's work.
    A greater threat to women is that when capitalists want to lay off workers, women are often the first to bear the brunt. During World War II, due to the lack of labor, the British authorities needed women to contribute to the war effort, and the number of female workers soared to 7.75 million. Now, with the increase in unemployment, the female workers who worked quite well during the war have gradually been kicked away by the capitalists. No one knows how many female workers became unemployed during this period. The current situation is that 150,000 women who want to work cannot find any jobs.
    Women find it more difficult than men to find work, or are fired earlier. Part of the reason is due to physiological differences. In British factories, there is no care for women at all. When a female worker is pregnant, not only is her work not reduced, but even the time to go to the health station for examination is deducted from her wages. Although British law stipulates that pregnant women have leave before and after childbirth, from the day you stop working, you will no longer receive wages. They can only get a meager amount of subsidies. Even this little money cannot be obtained if you do not pay social insurance premiums on time.
    After giving birth, whether you can return to your original job is also up to the capitalists to decide. The most common situation is that your job has already been replaced by another worker. Even if you can go back to work, it is also an insurmountable difficulty to arrange and take care of your children. During the war, the British authorities gave women some convenience because they needed a large number of women to participate in labor. At that time, there were 1,560 nurseries across the country, charging only one shilling per day. By 1956, only 500 were left. Now, there are even fewer left. In many areas, there is not even a single nursery. These remaining nurseries are charging more and more. Some cost ten shillings a day, and some even charge five pounds a week, which is almost equal to the entire income of an ordinary female worker. Many female workers told me about their plight. Brownfield said: "I get up at six o'clock every day and start working at seven ten. After returning home at five o'clock in the afternoon, a series of tasks are waiting: cooking, washing clothes, taking care of the children..., and I can't rest until midnight. People are already exhausted, and they don't even have the mood to talk about love." The female worker Collier had a different experience. After her first child was born, she was working as a waitress in a coffee shop. At that time, she had to bring her child to work every day, putting the child in the corridor and secretly taking time to breastfeed the child. Soon, she had a second child, and she lost her original job. She had to go to a paper mill to work as a night worker, leaving the child to the father who was exhausted after a day's work. Collier said: "If there is any way, I wouldn't go out to suffer this kind of crime. You know, just the rent alone takes up a quarter of my husband's salary. I need to earn some money to subsidize the family."
    In this country, female workers endure much more suffering than ordinary workers. The female workers I came into contact with all yearned for the status of women in New China very much. When they heard that the nurseries in the People's Commune took care of children for free, they said humorously and sadly: "In Britain, only the air is free!"

    只因为她们是女人
    苏蓝
    在服装工厂中，男女工人面对面地坐着。他们使用同样的机器，缝着同样的衣服。当一天劳动结束的时候，妇女们从老板那儿领到一英镑的工资，但男工所得到的却是一英镑八个先令。
    这个厂的女工斯玛茀告诉我，她从十四岁起开始学裁缝，在服装工业中已经辛辛苦苦地劳动了三十九年；论技术，要算是第一流的了。但是她的工资却抵不上一个初进工厂的毛头小伙子。道理很简单：因为她是个女人。
    女人，尽管工作得一点也不比男人差，但却得不到与男人同样的工资。这在英国，似乎是天经地义，理所当然的事情。它好像一条无形的法律，不准任何人去触犯。
    在伦敦近郊的索斯豪尔区的许多工厂中，女工占到50％。在这里，有些最熟练的女工，却和最低一级的男工拿同样的工资。长期以来，她们就为比这些男工多赚一个便士而斗争。但是，她们始终未能突破这一关。在资本家看来，一个铜板之差算不得什么，但是如果女工工资高于男工，“同工不同酬”的制度便动摇了。他们的利润也有减少的危险。一个工人说得好：“如果实行同工同酬，资本家干么要雇女工呢？现在失业的男工有的是！”
    据统计，英国女工最低限度的工资，约为男工最低限度工资的75％。实际上，妇女拿回家去的钱，平均只不过男工的58％。
    资本家为了加强对妇女的剥削，在各个行业中都分为“男人工作”和“妇女工作”两部分。这就是说，一些技术要求较高的工作，只准男人干，不准妇女插手。她们不能成为排字工人、木匠、砖瓦匠、司机……。更奇怪的是，一个妇女可以在自己的厨房里烤出各种各样香喷喷的面包，但她不能在面包作坊中当面包师，在服装工业中，女工占80％，她们却没有资格担任剪裁工作。这种“分工”的秘密是：资本家只需配备几个熟练的男工，就可以大量地剥削廉价的妇女劳动力。
    把工作分为“男人工作”和“妇女工作”，事实上是毫无理由的。它只有一个目的，压低女工的工资。在我访问过的索斯豪尔区：有个无线电收音机工厂。装置收音机的电线，是一种非常精细的工作，它不仅要求很高的技术，而且需要一双灵巧的手。妇女做这个工作，要比男工更胜任些。资本家恰恰利用这一点，把这个工作称为“妇女工作”。近几年来，这家工厂的女工的工作愈来愈繁重，技术要求也愈来愈高。但当女工们要求增加工资时，资本家的回答是：“这本来就是妇女干的工作。既然是妇女工作，就不能得到男人的工资。”
    为了扩大这种差别待遇，许多行业中的技术工人训练班，都对妇女关上大门。即使妇女在长期劳动中学到了很多技术，也不允许她们担任男人的工作。
    对妇女的更大的威胁是，当资本家要解雇工人时，妇女往往首当其冲。在第二次世界大战期间，由于劳动力的缺乏，英国当局需要妇女为战争出力，当时女工猛增至七百七十五万人。而现在，随着失业人数的增长，在战时工作得相当出色的女工们，逐渐被资本家踢开了。谁也不知道，在此期间有多少女工沦为失业者。目前的情况是，有十五万要求工作的妇女，找不到任何职业。
    妇女比男子更难找到工作，或者更早地被解雇。部分的原因是因为生理上的差别。在英国的工厂中，根本谈不上对妇女的任何照顾。当一个女工怀孕时，不但不减轻工作，就是去保健站进行检查的时间，也要扣除工资。虽然英国法律规定，孕妇产前产后有假期，但从你停止工作的那天起，就再也领不到工资了。她们只能拿到寥寥无几的补助金。就是这几个钱，如果你不按期交纳社会保险费，也是得不到的。
    在生育以后，能不能回到原来的工作岗位，这也要由资本家来决定。最通常的情况是，你的工作早已被另一个工人所代替。即使你可以回去工作，但是怎样安排和照顾自己的孩子，也是无法克服的困难。在战争期间，英国当局由于需要大量妇女参加劳动，也曾给予妇女一些便利。当时，全国有一千五百六十个托儿所，收费每日只一先令。到了1956年，只剩下了五百个。现在，更是所剩无几了。在许多地区，甚至连一个托儿所也没有。这些残存的托儿所，收费越来越高。有的每天要十个先令，有的甚至每周索费五英镑，几乎等于一个普通女工的全部收入。许多女工向我诉说了她们的苦境。勃朗菲特说：“我每天六点钟起床，七点十分开始工作。下午五点钟回到家后，一连串的工作在等待着：做饭、洗衣、照顾孩子……，一直到半夜才能休息。人已经精疲力尽了，甚至连谈情说爱的心情都没有了。”女工柯立尔，则是另外一种遭遇。在她第一个孩子生出后，她正在一家咖啡店里当女工。那时，她不得不每天带着孩子去工作。把孩子放在走廊里，偷偷地抽空给孩子喂奶。不久，她有了第二个孩子，原来的工作失掉了。她只好到一个造纸厂去做夜工，把孩子留给经过一天劳动而疲劳不堪的爸爸。柯立尔说：“只要有一点办法，我也不出去受这种罪了。要知道，只是房租一项，就占去了我丈夫工资的四分之一。我需要赚几个钱来补助家用。”
    在这个国家里，女工承受着比一般工人沉重得多的痛苦。我所接触到的女工，对于新中国的妇女地位都非常向往。当听说人民公社的托儿所免费收托孩子时，她们又诙谐又心酸地说：“在英国，只有空气是不花钱的！”
