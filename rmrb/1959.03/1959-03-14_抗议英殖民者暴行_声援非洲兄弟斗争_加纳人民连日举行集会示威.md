Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 13th: Workers, farmers, women, and students in Accra, the capital of Ghana, held a demonstration in front of the British High Commission in Ghana today to protest the massacres carried out by the British colonial authorities in Central Africa.

This demonstration was initiated by the People's Convention Party, the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the Farmers Council, and student organizations to express condolences for the brothers killed in Central Africa.

Demonstrators, wearing black armbands, marched from Arena Square to the British High Commission. They sang the war songs they used to sing during the struggle for independence.

A black car drove in front of the procession, with a sign that read, "The killing of one East African is the same as the murder of one Ghanaian." The demonstrators held up signs that read "Down with Imperialism," "Imperialism Get Out of Africa," "Africa is for Africans," and "Release African Nationalist Leaders."

A delegation consisting of the General Secretary of the People's Convention Party, Poku; the Minister of Transport, Krobo Edusei; the General Secretary of the Ghana Trades Union Congress, Tetegah; and other representatives met with the British High Commissioner and handed him a resolution passed by a protest rally held by the Ghanaian people on the 12th.

While the delegation met with the British High Commissioner, demonstrators shouted slogans and sang war songs in front of the British High Commission. The demonstrators wore traditional costumes and performed ancient dances, wishing their African brothers victory in the struggle for freedom and independence.

The resolution submitted by the delegation protested the British colonial authorities' massacre of Africans in Nyasaland and the arrest of African leaders and other atrocities in Central Africa. The resolution demanded an immediate end to the killings and the release of the arrested nationalist leaders.

The resolution suggested that the Ghanaian government "declare the establishment of the Republic of Ghana before 1960 to show our disapproval of British colonial policy in Central Africa." The resolution also advocated that Ghana reconsider its position in the British Commonwealth.

The demonstrators later returned to Arena Square and held a minute of silence to mourn the African brothers who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against colonial rule in Central Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 12th: A large-scale mass rally was held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, today to protest the British colonialists' massacre of unarmed Africans in Nyasaland and other parts of Central Africa.

The conference was jointly organized by the People's Convention Party, the Ghana Trades Union Congress, the Ghana Farmers Association, the National Union of Socialist Student Organizations, and the All-African People's Conference.

Thousands of people participated in the rally, all wearing black armbands to mourn the African brothers who were killed in Nyasaland and other parts of Central Africa. Ghana's Minister of Transport, Krobo Edusei, and Minister Without Portfolio, Welbeck, also attended the rally.

McConaughey, Secretary of the Standing Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, said in his speech that Africans are the same as other races. He said that we must regain freedom and dignity.

Poku, General Secretary of the People's Convention Party, called on the people of Ghana to support their Central African brothers.

Tetegah, General Secretary of the Ghana Trades Union Congress, announced that on March 13, the day of commemorating the victims of Nyasaland, Ghanaian workers would stop work for one minute at 11:00 a.m. to mourn the brothers killed in Nyasaland. He called on people to participate in the demonstration to be held in front of the British High Commission here on the 13th.

The conference passed a resolution saying that it was deeply shocked by the British colonialists' massacre of unarmed Africans, mass arrests of African leaders, and suppression of African political organizations in Nyasaland. The resolution demanded the immediate release of Dr. Banda and other nationalist leaders.

The resolution ended with the slogans: "Down with British Colonialism!" "Long Live African Unity and Friendship!" "Step Over the Already Dead Central African Federation, and Advance to Independence!"

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 12th: The Standing Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference announced here today that the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference will convene a meeting in March or April to decide what effective actions to take to support the struggle of the people of Central Africa for freedom and independence.

Pantjier, Administrative Secretary of the Standing Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, said that under normal circumstances, the committee should meet in June of this year, but in view of the rapid downturn in the African nationalist movement, the All-African People's Conference and its General Affairs Committee Chairman Mboya believe that it is imperative for the committee to convene a meeting as early as March or April.

Pantjier said that the committee will discuss and decide on the following matters: 1. A proposal regarding direct negotiations with the British government and the governments of Kenya, Rhodesia, and Nyasaland by the All-African People's Conference to represent African nationalists who are struggling and those who have been harmed by the recent actions taken by the British government in Kenya, Rhodesia, and Nyasaland; 2. Raising funds; 3. Studying and deciding on the most effective way to mobilize world opinion to support the African national liberation movement, and formulating concrete measures to achieve this goal.

    加纳人民连日举行集会示威
    新华社阿克拉13日电　加纳首都阿克拉的工人、农民、妇女和学生今天在英国驻加纳高级专员公署门前举行示威，抗议英国殖民当局在中非进行的屠杀。
    这次示威游行是由人民大会党、加纳工会大会、农民理事会和学生组织发起的，以表示对中非被杀害的兄弟的哀悼。
    臂上佩带黑纱的示威群众从阿伦纳广场出发到英国驻加纳高级专员公署。他们唱着过去在争取独立斗争中所唱的战歌。
    一辆黑色的汽车在游行队伍前面行驶，车上有一块字牌，上面写着“一个东非人被杀害也就是一个加纳人被谋害”。示威的人们举着标语牌，上面写着“打倒帝国主义”、
  “帝国主义滚出非洲去”、“非洲是非洲人的”、“释放非洲民族主义领袖”。
    一个由人民大会党总书记波库、交通部长克罗博·埃杜塞、加纳工会大会总书记特特加和其他一些代表组成的代表团，会见了英国驻加纳高级专员，并且把加纳人民在12日举行的一次抗议大会上所通过的一份决议交给他。
    当这个代表团会见英国驻加纳高级专员时，示威群众在英国高级专员公署门前高呼口号并且唱起战歌。示威者穿着民族服装，跳着古老的舞蹈，祝他们的非洲兄弟在争取自由和独立的斗争中取得胜利。
    由代表团递交的这份决议抗议英国殖民当局在尼亚萨兰屠杀非洲人和在中非逮捕非洲人领袖的暴行。决议要求立即停止屠杀并且释放被捕的民族主义领袖。
    决议建议加纳政府“在1960年以前宣布成立加纳共和国，以表示我们不赞成英国在中非的殖民政策”。决议还主张加纳重新考虑它在英联邦中的地位。
    示威者后来回到阿伦纳广场，进行了一分钟的默哀，悼念在中非反对殖民统治的斗争中牺牲的非洲弟兄。
    新华社阿克拉12日电　加纳首都阿克拉今天举行了一次大规模的群众集会，抗议英国殖民者在尼亚萨兰和中非其他地方屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人。
    这次大会是由人民大会党、加纳工会大会、加纳农民协会和社会主义学生组织全国联合会以及全非人民大会联合组织的。
    有成千上万的群众参加了这次大会，他们手臂上都带着黑纱，表示哀悼在尼亚萨兰和中非其他地方被杀害的非洲兄弟。加纳交通部长克罗博·埃杜塞和不管部长韦尔贝克也参加了大会。
    全非人民大会常设秘书处秘书麦克康嫩在讲话中说，非洲人是同其他种族一样的人。他说，我们必须重新获得自由和尊严。
    人民大会党总书记波库号召加纳人民支持他们的中非兄弟。
    加纳工会大会总书记特特加宣布，在3月13日纪念尼亚萨兰被害者的这一天，加纳工人将在上午十一点停止工作一分钟悼念在尼亚萨兰被杀害的兄弟。他号召人们参加13日在这里的英国高级专员公署门前举行的示威。
    大会通过决议说，它对英国殖民者在尼亚萨兰屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人、大批逮捕非洲人领袖以及镇压非洲人政治组织的行动感到非常震惊。决议要求立刻释放班达博士和其他民族主义领袖。
    决议的最后是口号：“打倒英国殖民主义”！“非洲人的团结和友谊万岁”！“跨过已经死亡的中非联邦，向独立前进”！
    新华社阿克拉12日电　全非人民大会常设秘书处今天在这里宣布，全非人民大会总务委员会将在3月或4月召开会议，以决定采取什么有效的行动来支持中非人民争取自由和独立的斗争。
    全非人民大会常设秘书处行政秘书潘齐勒说，在正常情况下，委员会应当在今年6月召开会议，但是鉴于非洲民族主义运动急转直下，全非人民大会及其总务委员会主席姆博亚认为委员会提早在3月或4月召开会议是刻不容缓的事。
    潘齐勒说，委员会将讨论和决定以下事项：一，关于由全非人民大会来代表正在进行斗争的非洲民族主义者并代表由于英国政府最近在怯尼亚、罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰采取的行动而受损害的人，同英国政府以及怯尼亚、罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰政府举行直接谈判的建议；二，募集款项；三，研究和决定动员世界舆论支持非洲民族解放运动的最有效的办法，并且拟订实现这个目的的具体措施。
