    New Folk Songs of Inner Mongolia
    The moon reflects on the white clouds,
    The moon comes to shine on the ground,
    The Communist Party brought a good life.
    The moon is like a bright lamp,
    Chairman Mao leads us in the Great Leap Forward.
    The moon is high and the stars are small,
    The socialist light shines in the sky.
    The moon is revealed in the clouds,
    Chairman Mao is like our own parents.
    The moon reflects on the white clouds,
    Forever following the Communist Party.
                (Tumed)
    The flowing water of Erdao River Bay,
    The flowing water of Erdao River Bay,
    My brother farms on the south hill.
    A finely woven straw hat with a blue ribbon,
    My sister plants cabbage in the mountain gully.
    The wind blows the poplars with a rustling sound,
    My brother has planted all the naked oats.
    Goats, sheep, and argali sheep,
    My sister drives the sheep to the mountain.
    The little goats bleat,
    My brother wants to win the banner in the team.
    The little lambs kneel to suckle,
    At the autumn harvest, we'll come to see my sister.
    Build more water conservancy projects and produce more grain,
    After the harvest, wear a more colorful dress.
               (Ike Chao League)
    The news-reporting train speeds along,
    The leaping people are in an uproar.
    Pairs of magpies sing in the sky,
    Communes and teams report good news.
            (Togtoh)
    More springs than stars
    The Milky Way in the sky is ten thousand miles long,
    The rivers on the ground flow to paradise.
    There are millions of stars in the sky,
    The springs of the Great Leap Forward are more than the stars.
                      (Wuchuan)
    You and I will never change our hearts
    My dear one is a hero,
    Your name is on the honor roll.
    The sun sets, dark and gloomy,
    You go to work early and late.
    In the third month, the peach blossoms bloom,
    My sister wants you and gets up early.
    Standing in front of the door, I want to see you,
    I met the secretary picking up manure!
    I was so embarrassed that I couldn't speak,
    I pretended to be carrying water!
    The spring breeze blows and all kinds of grass grow,
    You and I will never change our hearts.
                  (Fengzhen)

    内蒙新谣
    月亮映在白云上月亮上来照地明，共产党带来了好光景。月亮好比长明灯，毛主席领导咱们大跃进。月亮上来星宿小，社会主义光芒迎空照。云彩里边露月亮，毛主席像咱亲爹娘。月亮映在白云上，永远跟着共产党。
                （土默特族）
    二道河湾水长流二道河湾水长流，哥哥种地在南山头。二细草帽蓝飘带，妹妹在山沟种白菜。风吹白杨沙沙响，哥哥的莜麦全种上。山羊绵羊圪钉羊，妹妹赶羊上山岗。山羊羔羔咩咩叫，哥哥要在队里夺锦标。羊羔羔吃奶双蹄蹄跪，秋收丰收了再来眊妹妹。多修水利多打粮，丰收后多穿一件花衣裳。
               （伊克昭盟）
    报喜火车跑来一溜烟，跃进的人儿闹翻天。一对对喜鹊当空叫，社社队队把喜报。
            （托克托）
    泉眼比星多天上的银河呀万里长，地上的河道流水通天堂。天上的星星呀万万颗，大跃进的泉眼比星星多。
                      （武川）
    你我二人不变心我的亲人是英雄，光荣榜上有你名。太阳落山黑洞洞，起早贪黑你去劳动。三月里来桃花开，妹妹想你早起来。站在门前了了你，碰上支书拾粪哩。羞的我半天开不了口，鬼鬼说是担水哩！春风吹来百草生，你我二人不变心。
                  （丰　镇）
