Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Chairman Nosaka Sanzō stated at a press conference held in Niigata City yesterday that every effort must be made to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

He pointed out that if the revision of the "Security Treaty" succeeds, there is a danger of further deepening Japan's subordination to the United States and involving Japan in an atomic and hydrogen bomb war. He said that the "Security Treaty" should not be revised, but should be abolished.

Nosaka Sanzō said that in order to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, while relying on the strength within the Diet, it is even more necessary to unite all the forces outside the Diet.

When talking about the issue of trade between Japan and China, Nosaka Sanzō pointed out that as long as Kishi Nobusuke does not abandon his policy of hostility towards China, it is impossible to expect the establishment of normal trade relations with China. (Attached picture)

    野坂参三发表谈话
    日美“安全条约”必须废除
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三昨天在新澙市举行的记者招待会上发表谈话说，必须竭尽全力来阻止修改日美“安全条约”。
    他指出，如果修改“安全条约”得逞的话，就有进一步加深日本从属于美国并且使日本被卷进原子弹和氢弹战争的危险。他说，“安全条约”不应当修改，而应当废除。
    野坂参三说，为了打倒岸信介政府，在依靠国会里面的力量的同时，更加需要团结国会外面的所有力量。
    野坂参三在谈到日本同中国的贸易问题时指出，只要岸信介不放弃敌视中国的政策，那就不可能指望同中国建立正常的贸易关系。（附图片）
    这是从大牟田市出发的一路游行队伍，走在队伍前头的是社会党参议员吉田法晴（左）、社会党众议员田中稔男（右）。队伍将于三月七日到达东京。
