Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 1st: The Hebei Provincial Party Committee convened a conference of industrial secretaries from various regions and cities from February 26th to 28th. The conference determined to adopt all effective measures to fight a major battle in March, resolutely fulfilling the production plans for steel and coal, and laying a good foundation for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the second quarter and throughout the year.

The conference pointed out that Hebei Province is one of the country's important steel production and raw material production bases. Steel production accounts for a considerable proportion of the national total output, and the quality of coking coal and ore is also among the best in the country, undertaking a glorious task in supporting key steel enterprises. Therefore, the entire Party must do everything possible to resolutely fulfill the production tasks for steel and coal.

In order to guarantee the completion of the steel task, the conference determined to vigorously increase the daily output level of steel, improve the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, and gradually reduce sulfur content, coal consumption, and costs. To achieve these goals, the conference proposed the following measures: First, launch a mass movement, carry out a competition centered on high yield, high quality, and coal saving, and carry out mass technical reforms and technical management work; Through technical measures such as multi-nozzle combustion, beneficiation of ore, increasing air volume, and increasing air temperature, fully exploit the potential of blast furnaces. Second, seize the links of coal washing and coking, and accelerate the construction of No. 2 simple coking furnaces; In terms of washing and selection, in addition to completing modernized washing and selection equipment, we must focus on relatively simple and small equipment. Third, increase the capacity of ironmaking equipment. For the ironmaking equipment that has been determined to be manufactured, efforts should be made to complete it ahead of schedule. Fourth, strengthen the overhaul of blast furnaces.

The conference emphasized that completing the coal production plan is a very urgent task, both for completing the province's steel production task and supporting the national steel production. The conference called on workers on the coal front throughout the province to immediately launch a red flag competition upsurge centered on high speed and high yield, and achieve the target of 110,000 tons of daily output. To this end, party and government leading departments at all levels must first tightly grasp the daily production plan and grasp the progress, and take timely measures to solve specific problems. Second, boldly mobilize the masses, vigorously promote high speed, high yield, and large-scale harvests, and set off an upsurge among employees to compare their vigor, tasks, large-scale harvests, safety, and attendance. Third, improve labor organization, improve labor efficiency, give full play to the effectiveness of existing mechanical operations, and give play to the potential of labor. Fourth, implement the policy of walking on two legs, both accelerating the construction of mines and developing more small coal kilns. Fifth, relevant industrial, transportation, commercial, and cultural departments should also work together and vigorously support the coal industry.

In order to ensure the completion of the steel and coal tasks, the conference also called on the entire Party and the entire people to show the vigor of vigorously developing steel last year and vigorously develop steel and coal production. Party committees at all levels must take charge personally and follow through to the end.

The conference emphasized that party committees at all levels should resolutely implement the national unified plan, and first ensure the completion of national steel and coal targets. In terms of the allocation of raw materials, priority should be given to key areas over general ones; when conflicts occur, we should resolutely obey the overall situation and ensure the key areas; the use of raw materials must also be concentrated to ensure the supply of major national projects.

    河北工业书记会议具体部署生产任务
    大力提高钢铁煤日产水平
    新华社天津1日电　中共河北省委在2月26日到28日召开各地、市委工业书记会议。会议确定采取一切有效措施在3月份打一个大仗，坚决完成钢铁煤炭生产计划，并且为实现第二季度和全年更大更好更全面的跃进打下良好基础。
    会议指出，河北省是全国重要的钢铁生产和原料生产基地之一，钢铁产量在全国总产量中都占相当的比重，焦煤、矿石质量也是全国较好的，在支援重点钢铁企业中担负着十分光荣的任务。因此，全党必须尽一切可能坚决完成钢铁煤炭的生产任务。
    为了保证钢铁任务的完成，会议确定要大力提高钢铁的日产水平，提高高炉利用系数，逐步降低含硫量、煤耗和成本。为了实现这些指标，会议提出以下措施：一，大搞群众运动，开展以高产、优质、节煤为中心的竞赛，开展群众性的技术改革和技术管理工作；要通过多嘴燃烧、精选矿石、加大风量、提高风温等技术措施，充分发挥高炉的潜力。二，抓紧洗煤、炼焦等环节，加速建设二号简易炼焦炉；在洗选方面，除了完成近代化洗选设备以外，要突出地抓比较简易和小型的设备。三，增加炼铁设备能力。对于已经确定制造的炼铁设备，要争取提前完成。四，加强高炉的检修工作。
    会议着重指出，完成煤炭生产计划，无论对完成本省钢铁生产任务和支援全国钢铁生产，都是一项十分紧迫的任务。会议号召全省煤炭战线上的职工，立即掀起一个以高速高产为中心的红旗竞赛高潮，实现日产十一万吨的指标。为此，各级党政领导部门要首先紧紧地抓日产计划、抓进度，及时采取措施解决具体问题。其次，要放手发动群众，大搞高速、高产、大面积丰收，在职工中掀起比干劲、比任务、比大面积丰收、比安全、比出勤的热潮。第三，改进劳动组织，提高劳动效率，充分发挥现有机械作业的效能，发挥劳动力的潜力。第四，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，既要加快矿井的建设，也要多搞小煤窑。第五，各有关工业、交通运输业、商业，以及文化部门等单位，也要协同作战，大力支援煤炭工业。
    为了保证钢铁煤炭任务的完成，会议还号召全党全民拿出去年大搞钢铁的干劲，大搞钢铁煤炭生产。各地党委要亲自抓，并且要抓到底。
    会议强调指出，各级党委应坚决贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，首先保证全国钢铁煤炭指标的完成。在原材料的调拨方面，要先重点后一般；在发生矛盾时，应坚决服从全局，保证重点；在原材料的使用上，也必须集中，保证国家主要项目的供应。（附图片）
