Beijing medical personnel carefully treat the steel fighter
    Qiu Cai Kang's joint function has basically recovered
    Already able to walk on his own, returned to Shanghai for recuperation the day before yesterday

    (Our Newspaper) News: After more than three months of collaborative treatment by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital and relevant medical units in the capital, the steel fighter Qiu Cai Kang has basically recovered the joint function of his upper and lower limbs. At a little after 4 p.m. on the 19th, at the Beijing Railway Station, he boarded the 15th direct express train to Shanghai without assistance, waving goodbye to the people who came to see him off.

    Before boarding the train, Qiu Cai Kang told reporters, "Under the kind care of the Party and the people of the capital, and with the full treatment of the medical community, my health is very good: my weight has increased from 55.5 kilograms to 65.5 kilograms; the itching, sores, and infections all over my body have improved significantly; originally I needed two people to help me walk, but now I can walk up and down three flights of stairs on my own; my right arm can bend to more than 70 degrees; and I no longer need to be fed when eating. Recently, I used my right hand, which only has three fingers, to write more than 20 reply letters to comrades and friends who care about me, and I also wrote a more than 3,000-word ideological report to the Party organization!"

    Qiu Cai Kang was transferred from Shanghai Guangci Hospital to Beijing on November 23 last year for continued treatment. After he arrived at Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, the hospital's Party committee immediately held a mobilization meeting, calling on all medical staff and workers to further learn from the high sense of political responsibility and communist style of Shanghai Guangci Hospital in rescuing Qiu Cai Kang, and to learn from Qiu Cai Kang's noble qualities of the working class, so that the steel fighter could recover his health as soon as possible and return to the steel front. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the hospital organized a special medical and nursing team for Qiu Cai Kang, regularly studied his condition, determined treatment plans, and mobilized everyone to contribute ideas. In more than three months, 617 physical therapy and exercise therapy sessions were carried out, which greatly promoted the recovery of his joint function. The scar contracture of Qiu Cai Kang after the burn was hard, and no treatment method was found in the medical literature. The medical staff studied the use of sound wave vibration to soften the scar, and the effect was very good. Qiu Cai Kang's skin was prone to infection and often itchy after the burn. The medical staff used 19 methods to treat it, and now his skin itching has been greatly reduced.

    After research by relevant departments, it was believed that Qiu Cai Kang's joint function recovery treatment task in Beijing had been completed, and it was decided to transfer him to Shanghai for recuperation.

    During his treatment in Beijing, Qiu Cai Kang's spirit became increasingly vigorous, and he stubbornly insisted on studying. As soon as he arrived at the hospital, he subscribed to the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily, and studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party and Chairman Mao's works. In more than three months, he also read novels such as "Dedication to the Party" and "How Steel Was Tempered." Qiu Cai Kang said, "The Party has given me a second life, and I will never fail the expectations of the Party and the people of the whole country. Although I am disabled, my two eyes can still see, my two legs can still walk, and I still have a fiery heart. I am determined to always be a working-class fighter who is disabled but not disheartened." (Attached photo)

    北京医务人员精心医治钢铁战士
    丘财康关节功能基本恢复
    已能自己走路，前天由北京回上海休养
    本报讯　钢铁战士丘财康经过北京中苏友谊医院和首都各有关医疗单位三个多月的协作治疗，上下肢的关节功能已经基本恢复。19日下午四点多钟，他在北京车站不用人搀扶，自己以矫健的步子走上到上海去的第十五次直达快车车厢，向送行的人们挥手告别。
    丘财康在上火车以前告诉记者说：“我在党和首都人民的亲切关怀以及医务界的全力治疗下，健康状况很好：体重从五十五点五公斤增加到六十五点五公斤；全身皮肤发痒、破伤和感染情况显著好转；原来需要两个人搀扶才能走路，现在自己能上下三层楼；右臂可以弯曲到七十多度；吃饭已经不用喂了。最近，我用只有三个指头的右手，给关心我的同志和朋友写了二十多封回信，并且还写了一篇三千多字的向党组织的思想汇报哩！”
    丘财康是去年11月23日从上海广慈医院转到北京继续进行治疗的。他到北京中苏友谊医院以后，医院党委立即召开了动员大会，号召全院医务人员和职工进一步学习上海广慈医院抢救丘财康的高度政治责任感和共产主义风格，学习丘财康的工人阶级的高贵品质，让钢铁战士早日恢复健康，重返钢铁前线。全院在党委的领导下，组织了丘财康的专门医疗和护理小组，经常研究他的病情，确定治疗方案，并且发动大家献计。在三个多月内作了六百一十七次理疗和体疗，大大促进了他的关节功能的恢复。丘财康烧伤后的疤痕挛缩发硬，医疗文献中找不到任何治疗方法的记载，医务人员研究出用声波的振荡作用来使疤痕软化，疗效很好。丘财康烧伤后的皮肤容易感染，经常发痒，医务人员用了十九种方法进行治疗，现在他的皮肤发痒已大为减轻。
    经过有关部门的研究，认为丘财康在北京恢复关节功能的治疗任务已经完成，决定将他转到上海进行疗养。
    丘财康在北京治疗期间，精神日益旺盛，顽强地坚持了学习。他一来医院就订了人民日报和中国青年报，学习了党的六中全会的文件和毛主席的著作。在三个多月中，他还看了“把一切献给党”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等小说。丘财康说：“党给了我第二次生命，我决不辜负党和全国人民对我的希望。我虽然残废了，但我的两只眼睛还能看，两条腿还能走路，还有一颗火热的心，我决心永远做一个身残心不残的工人阶级的战士。”（附图片）
    列车快要开动了，丘财康（左）和欢送他的医务人员们话别。
