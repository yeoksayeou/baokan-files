Students Learn Skills by Taking Workers as Teachers
Beijing Mining Institute Students Sign Apprenticeship Contracts with Factory and Mine Workers

(Reported by our newspaper) Beijing Mining Institute students participating in production labor at factories and mines such as Jingxi and Kailuan have signed apprenticeship contracts with workers according to the teaching plan, providing a form for combining students and workers.

Last year, all 790 students from the Beijing Mining Institute who participated in production labor in various factories and mines signed apprenticeship contracts with workers. All apprenticeship contracts were conducted under the leadership of the factory and mine Party committees and were presided over by the Party branches of grassroots production units. Party organizations in various factories and mines selected relatively outstanding workers to serve as masters. The content of the contracts was determined according to the student's major and grade level. It included the requirements for students to participate in production labor during this period; the specific content of the production technology to be learned; the master's measures and guarantees; and the student's determination to learn. During the execution of the contract, the Party branch of the grassroots production unit was responsible for supervising and inspecting.

After signing the contract, workers regarded guiding students as a glorious task entrusted to them by the Party. They actively formulated specific plans to train students according to the contents stipulated in the contract. Four mechanical installation workers at the Majiagou Mine in Kailuan divided the mine's mechanical installation work into four major sections to teach the students, teaching operation techniques during production time and teaching the basic theory of operation during spare time. Workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine Well Construction Engineering Office taught students step by step according to the more than ten work procedures of well construction. Some workers at the Jingxi Coal Mine also joined forces to hold lectures for students, talking about the experience they had accumulated over the years. These lessons were sometimes conducted in mines and workshops, and sometimes on the kang (heated brick bed) in workers' homes. The workers always did their best to teach the students. Wei Yongcun, a coal miner at the Jingxi Anjiatan Coal Mine, said to the students: "The Party wants me to train you to be a fifth-grade worker, and I must ensure that you are worthy of the title of fifth-grade worker in every coal mine across the country." After the four-month contract period, the vast majority of these students completed or overfulfilled their learning plans.

Some students also helped their masters to improve their cultural knowledge in the process of executing the contract, and some summarized advanced experiences and carried out technological innovations with their masters. According to incomplete statistics, 570 technical reforms have been completed. The book "Installation Method of Large Winches" written by the students of the Department of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering based on the experience of their masters has been included in the teaching materials of the Mining Institute.

The fixed master-apprentice relationship formed through contracts between students and workers makes it easier for workers to treat students as members of their own families, educating them ideologically through daily production and life together, and also makes it easier for students to more deeply understand and learn the excellent qualities of workers. Before the contract was signed, the workers treated the students as guests. After the contract was signed, the students became their apprentices, and they cared for and educated the students everywhere, taking them down the mine together and eating together during breaks. When it got cold and some students' cotton clothes had not yet been sent, they took off their own cotton coats and gave them to the students. Some workers told the students about their past lives of being exploited and their struggles against the reactionary rulers. Some workers took students to their homes to reunite with their families, allowing students to understand the happiness of their lives today. These are the most valuable political lessons for the students.

The deep master-apprentice friendship formed between students and workers also has a longer-term effect, enabling the workers to continue to care about the growth of these young people after the students leave the factory and mine. Now, many workers in Jingxi Coal Mine and Kailuan Coal Mine often write letters to encourage students to study hard, and when students encounter difficulties, they also write letters to their masters for help.

### 拜工人为师　学生产本领  北京矿业学院学生和厂矿工人签订师徒合同

    拜工人为师　学生产本领
    北京矿业学院学生和厂矿工人签订师徒合同
    本报讯　北京矿业学院到京西、开滦等厂矿参加生产劳动的学生和工人按教学计划签订师徒合同，为学生和工人结合提供了一种形式。
    北京矿业学院去年到各地厂矿参加生产劳动的七百九十名学生都和工人签订了师徒合同，所有师徒合同都是在厂矿党委领导下由基层生产单位党支部主持进行的。各厂矿党组织都选派了比较优秀的工人担任师傅。合同的内容按学生所学专业和年级的情况而订，里面包括学生在这段时间里参加生产劳动的要求；需要学习的生产技术的具体内容；师傅的措施和保证，学生的学习决心。合同执行过程中由基层生产单位党支部负责督促检查。
    工人和学生签订合同后，都把指导学生当作党交给自己的光荣任务。他们主动积极地根据合同所规定的内容制订了培养学生的具体计划。开滦马家沟矿的四位机械安装工把矿山上的机械安装工作分成四大段来教学生，在生产时间里教操作技术，在业余时间里教操作的基本理论。开滦煤矿建井工程处的工人按建井的十多种工序一步步的教学生。京西煤矿有些工人还联合起来为学生办讲座，讲他们每人多年积累的经验。这些课有时在矿井、车间里进行，有时在工人家的炕头上进行。工人们总是尽自己所能来教导学生。京西安家滩煤矿的采煤工隗永存对学生说：“党要我把你培养成五级工，就要保证你到全国各个煤矿去都配称得起五级工。”四个月合同期满，这些学生绝大多数都完成或超额完成了学习计划。
    有些学生在执行合同的过程中也帮助自己的师傅补习了文化知识，有的和师傅一起总结先进经验、进行技术革新，据不完整的统计，已完成的技术改革达五百七十项。机电系的学生根据自己师傅的经验写成的大绞车安装方法一书，已列为矿业学院的教材。
    学生和工人通过合同形成一种固定的师徒关系，便于工人把学生当作自己家里人，从日常生产、生活的共处中对学生进行思想教育，也便于学生更深入地了解工人学习工人的优秀品质。没有签订合同时，工人把学生当作客人，合同签订后，学生成了他们的徒弟，他们也就处处关心学生，教育学生，带着学生一起下井，休息时在一起吃饭。天冷了，有些学生的棉衣还没有寄来，他们脱下自己身上的棉袄给学生穿。有的工人给学生讲过去受剥削的生活及同反动统治者进行斗争的情况。有的工人把学生带到家里和家人团聚，让学生了解他们今天生活的幸福情况。这些对学生们来说都是最难得的政治课。
    学生和工人结下的深厚师徒友谊还有更长远的作用，它使工人们在学生离开厂矿后仍继续关心这些青年人的成长。现在京西煤矿、开滦煤矿的不少工人经常写信鼓励学生努力学习，学生们碰到困难时也写信去找师傅帮助。
