    Get Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Produced Early
    By the People's Daily Commentator
    This year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front, centered on grain and cotton, requires strong support from the industrial sector. We must actively produce things like irrigation and drainage machinery, combine harvesters, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. The need for irrigation and drainage machinery is particularly urgent, so the state has listed it, along with equipment for mines, steel rolling, coal washing, coking, locomotives and rolling stock, and power stations, as key areas of industrial production at present. Expediting the manufacture of large quantities of powered irrigation and drainage machinery is an important task that all localities and relevant departments across the country must concentrate their efforts on ensuring its completion.
    Last year, all parts of the country manufactured large quantities of powered irrigation and drainage machinery, which played a significant role in combating drought and preventing flooding, overcoming the shortage of rural labor, and ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. If agriculture is to achieve a greater leap forward, the "water" aspect—farmland irrigation and drainage—in the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" is a very important link. This year, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries are to be comprehensively and greatly developed, and rural labor is relatively tight, so there is a need to move further towards the mechanization of farmland irrigation and drainage. Since last winter, some areas have experienced little rain and snow or abnormal weather, and drought and flooding are possible, requiring timely prevention. All of these factors require the production of more and better powered irrigation and drainage machinery this year. However, to date, the amount of powered irrigation and drainage machinery produced nationwide is still far from the planned quantity. However, the production and supply of powered irrigation and drainage machinery are highly seasonal, and time is tight and pressing. Workers in the machinery industry must race against time and strive to get the production of irrigation and drainage machinery ahead of the season!
    There are many favorable conditions for completing this glorious task. For example, during last year's Great Leap Forward, a number of small and medium-sized machinery factories were established in various places, a number of technical personnel were trained, and a lot of experience was accumulated in the manufacture of powered irrigation and drainage machinery. After last year's actual use, various localities have finalized a number of product varieties suitable for the specific conditions in rural China, and this year, with necessary improvements, they can be produced in batches using existing equipment. Now, as long as we make full use of various favorable conditions, thoroughly grasp the measures, and promptly solve specific problems in production, we can successfully complete the task.
    The manufacture of powered irrigation and drainage machinery requires reliance on large factories, but also on small and medium-sized factories. Special attention should be paid to giving full play to the role of small and medium-sized machinery factories. Because large machinery factories are currently undertaking the heavy task of expediting the manufacture of mining machinery, steel rolling equipment, coal washing and coking equipment, power station equipment, and other heavy tasks, most of the powered irrigation and drainage machinery will be manufactured by small and medium-sized factories. In fact, small and medium-sized machinery factories are capable of undertaking this task. For example, eight county-run machinery factories in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, have produced 150 powered irrigation and drainage machines, totaling more than 1,200 horsepower, since October of last year. Giving full play to the role of small and medium-sized factories will not only ensure the completion of the production tasks for irrigation and drainage machinery, but also allow large factories to free up more strength to produce other key products. Of course, large factories should also undertake some tasks in the manufacture of irrigation and drainage machinery that small and medium-sized factories find difficult to complete. Large products and certain components, such as oil pumps, oil nozzles, and rubber tubes, need to be manufactured by large factories, or technically assisted in their manufacture by small and medium-sized factories. In short, large, medium, and small factories should divide their work and cooperate to complete this task together.
    In the process of manufacturing irrigation and drainage machinery, we must actively find ways to save steel and pig iron and use substitute materials. Since the materials required for powered irrigation and drainage machinery are generally not very demanding, the possibility of saving and substitution is relatively high. The Chongqing Water Pump Factory improved the structure of a water pump, installing a bracket on the motor housing instead of the original bracket, saving more than one-third of the steel and pig iron. The Shenyang Tractor Factory improved the structure of a 27-horsepower diesel engine, reducing the weight of the diesel engine by one-third. The Cangzhou Power Machine Factory used local steel to forge the crankshafts, connecting rods, and other major components of powered irrigation and drainage machinery. These experiences show that as long as we actively take measures such as improving product design and utilizing local steel and iron, we can produce more irrigation and drainage machinery with limited materials, and we can save some good steel and iron to manufacture other key products.
    Of course, the manufacture of powered irrigation and drainage machinery requires strict quality assurance and continuous improvement of quality. If powered irrigation and drainage machinery goes to the countryside and can only be turned on and off intermittently, with ten machines only working like five, it will delay important matters at the crucial time of farmland irrigation and drainage, causing adverse consequences. This is also a great waste in terms of manpower and materials. The experience of many factories in the past has proven that quality and quantity can be unified, and by focusing on quantity, quality can also be improved. The specific methods are: improving the process, improving tools, improving operation, and establishing necessary quality inspection and testing systems.
    The repair and fitting work of existing powered irrigation and drainage machinery must also be stepped up. According to rough statistics from Hebei, Anhui, and other places, about half of the existing powered irrigation and drainage machinery needs to be repaired. Repairing is generally easier and more effective than manufacturing, and it can quickly catch up with the agricultural season. This is also an effective way to increase irrigation and drainage capacity.
    Now, the forces for producing powered irrigation and drainage machinery have been initially organized in various places, and it is necessary to further tighten up, tighten up every day, and tighten up every hour. Expediting the manufacture of large quantities of powered irrigation and drainage machinery is an important link in ensuring the realization of this year's grain and cotton leap forward targets, and it is also a major issue related to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The relevant machinery factories should further explain the great significance of this work to the workers, deeply mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements centered on technological revolution, and expedite the manufacture of irrigation and drainage machinery quickly and well. Time waits for no one, and opportunity must not be missed!

    及早把排灌机械造出来
    本报评论员
    今年农业战线上以粮、棉为中心的更大更好更全面的跃进，需要工业部门大力支持。诸如排灌机械、联合收割机、化学肥料、农药等，都要积极生产。排灌机械的需要尤其迫切，所以国家把它同矿山、轧钢、洗煤、炼焦、机车车辆、电站等设备一起，列为目前工业生产的重点。及时赶制出大批排灌动力机械，是全国各地、各有关部门要集中力量保证完成的一项重要任务。
    去年全国各地制造了大批排灌动力机械，对抗旱防涝，克服农村劳动力不足的困难，保证农业大丰收，起了显著的作用。农业要实现更大的跃进，农业“八字宪法”中的“水”——农田排灌是一个十分重要的环节；今年农林牧副渔要全面大发展，农村劳动力比较紧张，因此需要向农田排灌的机械化前进一步；去冬以来，有些地方雨雪稀少，或者气候不够正常，有旱涝可能，需要及时预防：这些因素都要求在今年生产更多、更好的排灌动力机械。而到目前为止，全国生产的排灌动力机械，距离预定数量还相差很多。可是，排灌动力机械的生产和供应有强烈的季节性，时间紧迫，刻不容缓。机械工业部门的职工要和时间赛跑，力争排灌机械的生产赶在季节前面！
    完成这一光荣任务，有许多有利条件。例如，去年大跃进中，各地都建立了一批中小型机械工厂，培养了一批技术力量，并且在制造排灌动力机械方面积累了不少经验。经过去年的实际使用，各地都定型了一批适合我国农村具体条件的产品品种，今年再作必要的改进，就可以利用原有的设备成批生产。现在只要充分利用各种有利条件，深入地抓措施，及时解决生产中的具体问题，便能胜利完成任务。
    制造排灌动力机械，需要依靠大厂，也要依靠中小型工厂。特别要注意很好地发挥中小型机械工厂的作用。由于目前大型机械工厂担负了赶制矿山机械、轧钢设备、洗煤炼焦设备、电站设备等繁重的任务，排灌动力机械将大部分由中小型工厂来制造。事实上，中小型机械厂是能够担负这一任务的。例如，河北省宁津县八个县办的机械厂，从去年10月份以来，就生产了一百五十台排灌动力机械，共一千二百多马力。充分发挥中小型工厂的作用，不但可以保证排灌机械生产任务的完成，而且可以使大型工厂腾出更多的力量来生产其他重点产品。当然，大型工厂在排灌机械制造方面也要担负一些中小型工厂难以完成的任务。大型产品和某些部件，如油泵、油嘴、胶管等，就需要大型工厂来制造，或者从技术上帮助中小型工厂制造。总之，大中小型工厂要分工协作，共同努力来完成这一任务。
    在排灌机械的制造过程中，要积极设法节约钢材、生铁，采用代用材料。由于排灌动力机械需用的材料一般都要求不很高，节约和代用的可能性就比较大。重庆水泵厂改进了一种水泵的结构，在马达壳上安装一个支架代替原来的托架，就节约钢材、生铁三分之一以上。沈阳拖拉机厂改进了二十七马力柴油机的结构，使柴油机的自重减轻了三分之一。沧州动力机厂用土钢锻成了排灌动力机械的曲轴、连杆等主要部件。这些经验说明：只要积极采取改进产品设计、利用土钢土铁等措施，就可以用有限的材料生产出更多的排灌机械，并且可以节省出一些好钢好铁用来制造其他重点产品。
    当然，制造排灌动力机械需要严格保证质量，不断提高质量，如果排灌动力机械下了乡，只能开开停停，十台只顶得五台用，在农田排灌的紧要关头就会耽误大事，造成不良后果。这在人力、物力方面也是很大的浪费。过去许多工厂的经验都证明：质量和产量是可以统一的，抓紧了产量，同时也能提高质量。具体的办法是：改进工艺，改进工具，改进操作，同时建立必要的质量检查制度和检验制度。
    现有排灌动力机械的修配工作也要抓紧。据河北、安徽等地的概略统计，现有排灌动力机械约有半数需要修理。修理一般要比制造容易，收效快，能够迅速赶上农时。这也是增加排灌力量的有效办法。
    现在，各地生产排灌动力机械的力量已经初步组织起来了，还需要进一步抓紧，日日抓紧，时时抓紧。及时赶制出大批排灌动力机械，是保证实现今年粮、棉跃进指标的重要一环，也是关系到进一步巩固工农联盟的大问题。各有关机械厂要向职工进一步说明这一工作的重大意义，深入发动群众，大搞以技术革命为中心的群众运动，又快又好地把排灌机械赶制出来。时不可误，机不可失！
