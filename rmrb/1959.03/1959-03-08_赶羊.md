Jingning County, Zhejiang Province, is rich in forest resources and is one of the main timber producing areas in the province. However, due to inconvenient land transportation, almost all the felled timber must be floated out through the many shallow streams and rivers. The method of floating is to tie the timber into small rafts and drag them downstream by manpower. Each person can only transport six cubic meters at a time. The total water transport distance in the county is as long as 460 li, and it takes dozens of days to drag them to the destination, which is time-consuming, laborious, and inefficient. At the same time, it is also restricted by the water level. If the water is too low, it cannot be floated; if the water is too high, it is not safe to float, for fear of losing the timber.

Last year, the staff of the County Forestry Bureau boldly tried in the technical innovation of water transportation. They used the "herding sheep" method during the high water season of the spring and summer streams and rivers, putting the timber one by one loosely into the river, allowing it to flow down by itself, and as a result, they broke through this difficulty. In this way, the amount of flow is large, and the flow rate is also very fast.

Before "herding sheep" and floating, they installed river barriers at the end of the floating route to block the timber flowing down. To ensure safety, an additional, stronger spare river barrier was added at a suitable location downstream of the river barrier to prevent the loss of timber due to the breaking of the first barrier rope by the high water. The location of the river barrier is generally downstream of one or several sharp bends where the river is deeper and the river surface is wider, so as to facilitate the accumulation of timber. In addition, guide floats were installed along the shoals, river forks, and places with reefs to guide the timber to flow down from the main stream, so as not to disperse into the river forks or swirl in the water.

In terms of floating organization, they established a floating headquarters to unify command and divide the work into sections, so that the upper and lower sections along the river cooperated with each other and supported each other, ensuring the safety of floating. According to the results of eight "herding sheep" floating trials, 21,500 cubic meters of timber were transported, saving 58,600 labor days, saving more than 113,000 yuan in transportation costs, and greatly shortening the floating time.

    “赶羊”
    浙江省景宁县，森林资源丰富，是全省木材主要产区之一。但是因为陆路交通不便，采伐下来的木材，几乎全部要通过滩多水浅的小溪小河才能流送出来。流送的方式，是把木材扎成小排，用人力顺水拖运，每人一次只能运六立方公尺，全县水运里程长达四百六十里，拖运至终点，需要几十天时间，费时费力，效率不高。同时，还受着水位高低的限制，水小了不能流送，水大了又不敢流送，怕冲失木材。
    去年，县林业局的职工在水运技术革新中，大胆尝试，他们利用春夏溪河水位高涨时期，用“赶羊”的办法，把木材一根根散放在河里，任其自行流下，结果突破了这一难关。这样，流送量大，流送速度也很快。
    他们在“赶羊”流送之前，在流送终点安设了拦河绠，以拦住流下的木材。为了保证安全，并在拦河绠下游适当地点，增加一道比较牢固的备用河绠，防止因水大冲断第一道绠绳而发生的木材流散损失。拦河绠的位置，一般是在有一处或几处急湾的下游而且河水较深河面较宽的地方，以便于拦积木材。另外，在沿浅滩、河岔和有礁石的地方，安设有诱导漂子，诱导木材从主流流下，不致散入河岔或回旋在水中。
    在流送组织上，他们成立了流送指挥部，统一指挥，分段包干，作到沿河各段上下配合，互相支援，保证了流送安全。据试行八次“赶羊”流送的结果，就运出两万一千五百立方公尺木材，比过去节省五万八千六百个劳动日，节约运费十一万三千多元，还大大缩短了流送时间。（附图片）
