Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th - Since mid-January, many leading cadres in Qinghai Province have been successively sent down to factories, mines, and people's communes to work as workers or commune members for a period of time, participating in and leading production.

Among these leading cadres are Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee; Yu Guang, First Secretary of the Xining Municipal Party Committee; many county party secretaries; and hundreds of directors, ministers, and bureau chiefs from provincial, municipal, and county levels. After arriving at the communes and factories/mines, they lived, ate, and worked together with the masses, and deeply understood the problems existing in practical work, and helped solve them in a timely manner. After Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, went to the Houzihe Brigade, Houzihe Team, Second Squad of the 713 People's Commune in the suburbs of Xining, he lived in the home of commune member Che Yonghong and ate in the Second Squad's canteen with the commune members. After breakfast every day, he went to work with the commune members, participating in tasks such as digging peat and adding heat to compost. In the process of going deep among the masses and into reality, he worked with the cadres and masses to study and solve key problems in production and commune operation and management, and helped the commune implement the production responsibility system. Yu Guang, First Secretary of the Xining Municipal Party Committee, went down to the Gaozhai Brigade of the Xiaoxia People's Commune and lived in the home of commune member Fan Hongyao in the Fifth Squad. He served as a cook in the Fifth Squad's canteen, often discussing with other cooks how to save food, how to ensure the commune members ate well, and how to improve canteen management. Xia Longyao, Director of the Qinghai Provincial Chemical Industry Bureau, went to the Carkhan Potash Fertilizer Plant in the Qaidam Basin and fought hard for three days and nights with other workers in the bitter cold, transporting a large amount of ice from thirty miles away to solve the problem of water for production and living at the potash fertilizer plant. Qiang Jianhua, Director of the Fuel Industry Bureau, participated in underground operations at the Donggou Coal Mine, which inspired the workers throughout the mine and greatly improved production.

Many cadres who were sent down also summarized work experience with the masses and wrote many articles that were very useful for promoting current production. For example, Guo Shi, Director of the Qinghai Metallurgical Bureau, and others at the Xining Iron and Steel Plant in Xining summarized the experiences of "how to keep the three-cubic-meter small blast furnace producing iron regularly" and "how to turn white cast iron into gray cast iron" with the workers, and wrote them into articles. These articles were written in response to the key problems existing in current production.

Currently, the work of sending cadres down in Qinghai Province is proceeding in rotation. After the first batch of dispatched leading cadres worked as workers and commune members for a period of time, they have successively returned to their original posts. They are summarizing their experiences and writing them into articles. At the same time, other leading cadres have been successively sent down to factories, mines, and people's communes.

(From our newspaper) Jinan - Another group of cadres and leaders from Shandong Province have gone to the front lines of production to be workers in factories and peasants in communes.

The CPC Liaocheng Prefectural Committee recently formulated a plan for the prefectural party committee secretaries and members to be dispatched to communes in batches to be commune members. It was decided that Li Jiping, First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, and Duan Junqing, Standing Committee member and Secretary-General, would be dispatched to the Laozhaozhuang Commune in Linqing City in the first batch as commune members, departing in early March.

The secretary, county magistrate, and members of the Guangrao County Party Committee take turns being dispatched to communes as commune members and to factories as workers in seven batches. Each batch rotates for forty days. The first batch was dispatched to communes and factories on February 15. The county party committee requires that cadres achieve "five goods" during their time being sent down: good at learning, good at labor, good at style, good at work, and good at cultivating experimental plots, to become "five-good" commune members. More than 3,000 people in Zhucheng County who need to participate in physical labor are dispatched to people's communes, factories, and stores in four batches as commune members, workers, and service personnel. Each batch labors for at least forty-five days; the first batch drew 600 cadres from county-level agencies to participate in physical labor, including members of the county party committee standing committee, county party committee members, and section and bureau chiefs, from February 12 to the end of March. Some of them are dispatched to communes as commune members, some as stewards of public canteens, and some as cooks, service personnel, breeders, and nursery staff. The county party committee requires that all cadres truly eat, live, and work with the masses during their time being sent down, integrate with the masses, humbly learn from the masses, play an exemplary leading role in various tasks, and deeply understand the problems in production labor and help solve them. The first batch of 45 leading cadres from Linyi City who went to commune production teams to be commune members have gone to four commune production teams including Dushutou in the suburbs, including Mu Lin, Standing Committee member of the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee and First Secretary of the Linyi Municipal Party Committee, Bao Peizhi, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Yang Xiuji, Deputy Mayor. Comrade Mu Lin went to the Chahe Commune as a commune member, and Comrade Bao Peizhi went to the Linyi First Steel Plant as a worker. Under the leadership of the secretary, the CPC Fan County Party Committee Office has dispatched more than 140 cadres in rotation to communes as commune members, including Ma Yuchang, Secretary of the County Party Committee. The CPC County Party Committees of Changyi, Wulian, Chiping and other counties have also recently dispatched a group of responsible cadres to communes as commune members. (See photo)

    新华社西宁6日电　青海省许多领导干部从1月中旬起，陆续下放到工厂、矿山和人民公社去当一个时期的工人或社员，参加生产和领导生产。
    在这些领导干部中，有中共青海省委第一书记高峰，西宁市委第一书记余光，许多县委书记，省、市、县各厅、部、局长等数百人。他们到达公社和厂矿以后，都和群众同吃同住同劳动，并深入了解实际工作中存在的问题，及时帮助解决。省委第一书记高峰到西宁市郊七一三人民公社后子河大队后子河中队第二小队后，就住在社员车永鸿的家里，和社员一起在第二小队食堂吃饭。他每天吃过早饭就和社员们一起出工，参加挖草炭、加温堆肥等劳动。在深入群众和深入实际的过程中，他和干部群众共同研究解决生产和公社经营管理中带有关键性的问题，帮助公社推行了生产责任制。西宁市委第一书记余光下放到小峡人民公社高寨大队后，住到第五小队社员范洪耀家里。他担任第五小队食堂的炊事员，经常和其他炊事员们研究如何既节约粮食、又能使社员们吃好，以及改进食堂管理工作等问题。青海省化工局局长夏隆尧到柴达木盆地的察尔汗钾肥厂后，和其他工人一起冒着凛冽的寒风苦战了三昼夜，从三十里以外运回大量冰块，以解决钾肥厂生产和生活的用水问题。燃料工业局局长强建华到东沟煤矿参加井下作业，鼓舞了全矿工人，使生产有了很大起色。
    不少下放的领导干部还和群众一道总结工作经验，写出了很多对推动当前生产有很大用处的文章。如青海冶金局局长郭石等在西宁市西宁炼铁厂，和工人们一道总结了“如何使三立方小高炉经常出铁”和“如何使白口铁变成灰口铁”等经验，并写成了文章，这些文章都是针对当前生产上存在的关键问题写成的。
    目前，青海省的干部下放工作正在轮流不息地进行着。第一批下放的领导干部当了一个时期的工人和社员后，已经陆续回到原来的工作岗位，他们正在总结经验，并且写成文章。同时，另外一些领导干部又相继下放到工厂、矿山和人民公社。

    中共聊城地委日前已就地委书记、委员分批下放当社员订出了规划，决定地委第一书记李吉平、常委兼秘书长段俊卿第一批下放到临清市老赵庄公社当社员，3月初出发。
