Xinhua News Agency, 18th - The Ministry of Agriculture, at the national telephone conference on spring large livestock breeding held on the evening of the 16th, stated that since the joint issuance of the notice by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on seizing the spring season to launch a large livestock breeding campaign, the campaign has been rolled out across various regions.

The conference pointed out that the achievements in large livestock breeding this spring are significant, characterized by: First, high enthusiasm. The leap-forward slogans put forward by various provinces (cities, districts) are clear, and the targets are advanced. Many places have proposed achieving "double fullness" (full pregnancy, full fat) and five comprehensives (comprehensive mating, comprehensive accuracy, comprehensive birth, comprehensive survival, comprehensive strength) this year. Provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Hunan, and Heilongjiang have proposed striving to achieve full pregnancy for all livestock in the province before May. The livestock breeding plans of twenty-one provinces exceed the "Ten Initiatives" target of a net increase of about 10% in large livestock. Second, early action. Some regions started livestock mating one to two months earlier than in previous years. Henan Province has already mated more than 420,000 head of female livestock, and Hebei Province has mated more than 110,000 head of large livestock. Third, good preparation work. Various regions have conducted extensive mobilization and specific arrangements for large livestock breeding, and a series of preparatory works have been grasped tightly and done well. Heilongjiang Province has established 788 comprehensive artificial insemination stations and 54 insemination points. According to statistics from 35 counties, 4,585 artificial insemination personnel have been trained. Jilin Province has selected more than 2,000 excellent breeding stallions and established seven comprehensive breeding farms.

The conference then analyzed the existing problems in the current livestock breeding work and required all regions to earnestly do the following work: All districts, people's communes, and production teams should treat March and April as spring breeding campaign months, conducting rush mating and achieving full pregnancy in May. Regions where the campaign has already been launched should immediately organize forces to conduct inspections team by team, trough by trough, and animal by animal, not allowing a single female animal to remain unbred. Regions where the campaign has not yet been launched should take effective measures and act quickly to ensure that the breeding work achieves good results. Regions with insufficient breeding livestock should select and allocate them locally. Regions with insufficient artificial insemination personnel should quickly carry out training. Regions with insufficient artificial insemination equipment should adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, solving the problem locally by using locally available materials. All regions and people's communes should conduct regular inspections and comparisons: Comparing the number of female animals mated and the number of pregnancies achieved; comparing the number of offspring born and the number raised alive; comparing the good fat condition and strong physique of the livestock. Through these inspections and comparisons, the campaign will be pushed to a new high tide.

Finally, the conference requested that while vigorously promoting large livestock breeding, all provinces (cities, districts) should also seize the work of hog, sheep, goat, and poultry production.

    突击配种　满怀有望
    各地开展大家畜繁殖运动有成绩
    据新华社18日讯　农业部在16日晚召开的春季全国大家畜配种繁殖电话会议认为：自2月下旬中共中央和国务院联合发布关于抓紧春季开展大家畜配种运动的通知后，大家畜配种繁殖运动已在各地展开。
    会议指出：今年春季大家畜配种繁殖工作的成绩很大，它的特点是：第一，干劲大。各省（市、区）提出的跃进口号明确，指标先进，许多地方都提出今年要实现“双满”（满怀、满膘）、五全（全配、全准、全产、全活、全壮）。河南、河北、湖南、黑龙江等省提出力争在5月份以前，全省牲口达到满怀。有二十一个省的牲畜繁殖计划超过了“十大倡议”中要求大家畜净增10％左右的指标。第二，动手早。有些地区牲畜配种工作比往年提早一到两个月，河南省已配母畜四十二万多头，河北省已配十一万多头大家畜。第三，准备工作好。各地对大家畜配种繁殖工作都作了广泛的动员和具体的布置，一系列的准备工作抓的紧，作的好。黑龙江省已建立了综合性人工授精站七百八十八个，输精点五十四个，据三十五个县统计已培训人工授精员四千五百八十五人，吉林省已选出优良种公马二千多匹，建立综合性的配种场七个。
    会议接着分析了当前牲畜配种繁殖工作中存在的问题，要求各地认真做好以下工作：各地区各人民公社和生产队，把3、4两个月份作为春季配种运动月，进行突击配种，在5月份实现满怀。运动已开展起来的地区，要立即组织力量，进行逐队、逐槽、逐畜检查，不让一头母畜空怀。运动还没有开展起来的地区，要采取有效措施，迅速行动起来，使配种工作收到良好效果。种畜不足的地区，就地进行选择和调剂。人工授精员不足的地区，赶紧进行培养训练。人工授精器材不足的地区，采取土洋并举的办法，就地取材解决。各地和各人民公社开展定期检查和评比：比母畜配的多，受胎的多；比子畜生的多，养活的多；比牲畜膘好，体力壮。通过这些检查评比，把运动推向一个新的高潮。
    会议最后要求各省（市、区）在大力搞好大家畜配种繁殖工作的同时，要抓紧生猪、绵羊、山羊和家禽生产的工作。
