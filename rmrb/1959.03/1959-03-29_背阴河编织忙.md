　　Busy Weaving at Bei Yin River
　　Chen Zonghan

　　The Bei Yin River People's Commune in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, is rich in sorghum. Sorghum stalks can be used to weave mats and containers for grain; the Shuang Dao Hu Mountain in the commune grows dense willow branches and moss, which are good materials for weaving baskets, winnowing fans, dustpans, and hampers. Therefore, the masses here have a habit of weaving, and this place has become an important weaving product area in the county.

　　Last year, the wave of the Great Leap Forward surged into Bei Yin River Township. Water conservancy projects and the Great Smelting Campaign needed a large number of earthen baskets, winnowing fans, and hampers. The grain harvest was abundant, and the demand for woven products such as grain containers was both large and urgent. The needs of this township and this county increased, and the demand from Harbin and Yichun, which had historically had supply relationships, also increased greatly. They constantly wrote letters and sent people to the supply and marketing cooperative to request goods.

　　The comrades of the supply and marketing cooperative carefully analyzed the situation and believed that to fully meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, the resources and technology for weaving production were not a problem. The main issue was how to allocate labor. Last year, 9,965 laborers in the township participated in agricultural production and other activities, and a large number of women were unable to participate in production because they were engaged in housework.

　　In order to organize female labor to participate in weaving production, the supply and marketing cooperative selected the Xin Fu work area for pilot projects. The Party branch of this work area strongly supported them. The Party branch set up six canteens and four nurseries in this work area to liberate the female labor force, and also mobilized elderly people with skilled techniques. They appropriately divided the work according to each person's technical expertise and universally promoted assembly line operations. Weaving operations generally have five processes: peeling, splitting, pressing, scraping, and weaving. Those with poor skills were allowed to do the first process—peeling—while skilled weaving experts were assigned to specialize in the "weaving" process. This allowed each person to give full play to their strengths. Thus, weaving production began throughout the work area.

　　With the success of the pilot project, the supply and marketing cooperative immediately reported to the township Party committee. The township Party committee also strongly supported them, first convening an on-site meeting in the Xin Fu work area to promote their approach of tapping labor potential to carry out weaving production. Nurseries, kindergartens, and canteens were universally established throughout the township, and then the township carefully rearranged the labor force to mobilize labor and semi-labor capable of participating in weaving production. The first secretary of the township Party committee personally took charge and oversaw this work. Soon, weaving and processing factories were universally established in various work areas, with the work area Party branch secretary serving as the factory director, and workshops were also established in each production team, with the team leader serving as the workshop director, with each level responsible and strengthening leadership. In addition, based on the characteristics of weaving production, decentralized production methods were adopted so that women at home could also participate in labor. When everyone in the township was mobilized and invested in weaving production, the demand for raw materials increased, and the Party committee used the methods of "connecting," "substituting," "collecting," and "saving" to adjust and exchange according to the existing raw materials and production capacity of each work area. The township solved the problem of more than 100,000 bundles of sorghum stalks. The supply and marketing cooperative purchased more than 200,000 jin of wood chips and a large amount of brushwood to replace sorghum stalks for firewood, basically solving the problem of raw materials for weaving production throughout the township. At the same time, the township Party committee also led the development of a "five comparisons" campaign, comparing the number of people participating in production, comparing output, comparing quality, comparing innovation, and comparing high yield. Soon, a high tide of weaving production was set off throughout the township.

　　Now, the supply and marketing cooperative is vigorously purchasing the large number of woven products produced by the Bei Yin River Commune in order to fully supply users in this township and other places and support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    背阴河编织忙
    陈宗汉
    黑龙江省五常县背阴河人民公社盛产高粱。用高粱秫秸可以编席子和盛粮食的茓子；社区内的双刀护山上长着密茂的柳条和苔条，又是编篓子、簸箩、簸箕、筐子的好材料。因此，这里的群众都有编织习惯，而这里也就成为全县编织品的重要产区。
    去年，大跃进的浪潮涌进了背阴河乡，水利工程和大炼钢铁需要大批土篮、簸箕、筐；粮食丰收了，要的茓子等编织物更是既多又急；本乡、本县的需要增加了，历史上有供应关系的哈尔滨市、伊春市等地的需要量也大大增加了，他们不断写信、派人找供销部要货。
    供销部的同志们认真分析了情况：认为要充分满足大跃进的需要，编织生产的资源、技术都不成问题。主要是劳动力如何调配。去年全乡有九千九百六十五个劳动力参加农业生产和其他活事，还有一大部分妇女，因为从事家务劳动不能参加生产。
    为了组织妇女劳动力参加编织生产，供销部就选择了新富作业区进行试点。这个作业区的党支部非常支持他们。党支部在这个作业区里办起六个食堂、四个托儿所，把妇女劳动力解放了出来，并且把技术熟练的老年人也动员起来，根据每个人技术特长适当分工，普遍推行了流水作业法。编织操作，一般有五道工序：橹、破、压、刮、编。技术差的就让他们做第一道工序——橹，技术熟练的编织能手，就让他们专门担任“编”的工序。这样，就使各人发挥所长。于是，整个作业区编织生产开展起来了。
    试点成功了，供销部立即向乡党委作了汇报。乡党委也很支持他们，首先在新富作业区召开了现场会议，推广他们挖掘劳动潜力开展编织生产的作法。并在全乡普遍成立了托儿所、幼儿园、食堂，然后又仔细地把全乡的劳动力重新加以安排，调动出可以参加编织生产的劳动力和半劳动力。乡党委第一书记并亲自挂帅，掌握这项工作。不久，各作业区普遍建立起编织加工工厂，作业区支部书记担任厂长，各生产队也成立了车间，由队长担任车间主任，层层负责，加强领导。此外，还根据编织生产的特点，采取分散生产的做法，使在家的妇女也能参加劳动。当全乡人人动手，投入编织生产的时候，需要的原料增多，党委就用“串”、“代”、“采”、“节”的办法，根据每个作业区的现有原料和生产能力，进行调剂串换，全乡解决了十万多捆秫秸；供销部又收购二十多万斤木拌子和大量毛柴来代替秫秸烧柴，基本上解决了全乡编织生产的原料问题。同时，乡党委还领导开展了“五比”运动，比参加生产的人数，比产量、比质量、比革新、比高产。很快就在全乡掀起了编织生产的高潮。
    现在，背阴河公社生产的大量编织品，供销部正大力进行收购，以充分供应本乡和外地的用户，支持工农业生产大跃进。（附图片）
