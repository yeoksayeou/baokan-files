Skillful Work Unleashes Great Potential – One Person Can Do the Work of Many
Zhangjiakou Launches Technical Revolution Movement, Twenty Units Complete First Quarter Tasks Ahead of Schedule

(Our newspaper, Zhangjiakou, March 26th dispatch) Workers on the industrial front in Zhangjiakou City are vigorously launching the "One Tops Two Five Eight" red flag competition centered on technical revolution (meaning one person does the work of two, five, or eight people). They have overfulfilled the production plans for January and February. By March 20th, twenty units in the city, including the Xiahuayuan Coal Mine, had completed their first-quarter production tasks ahead of schedule.

The "One Tops Two Five Eight" red flag competition is a mass movement to increase labor productivity that was summarized during the Great Leap Forward last year. In June of last year, veteran workers Zhao Fuhai, Li Tiancai, and section chief Feng Baorong of the Prospecting Machinery Factory improved technology to increase the efficiency of making 500-meter drilling rig drum shafts by 53 times. The factory Party committee seized on this advanced example and launched discussions in various workshops and teams. Some people proposed the "One Tops Two Five Eight Red Flag Competition Movement." The factory Party committee adopted the masses' opinions and launched this competition throughout the factory. Because the competition was so effective, it quickly spread from the Prospecting Machinery Factory to various factories and mines throughout the city. This year, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses in various factories and mines to continue the "One Tops Two Five Eight" red flag competition. As a result of the competition, some factories and mines that were originally not very confident about completing their production plans for January and February jumped up and overfulfilled their production plans for those months. During the competition, a lively scene of vigorously engaging in technical revolution appeared everywhere in factories and mines. As of the first half of March, the technical measures proposed by factories, mines, transportation, basic construction, and other units reached more than 900,000, playing a huge role in improving production. Thanks to the realization of 1,596 measures and suggestions proposed by the masses, the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory had 5,897 person-times reaching "One Tops Two Five Eight" and 109 double-shift times since March. Labor productivity increased by nearly one time compared with the same period in February, and the production tasks for the first ten days of the month were overfulfilled. In the forging and riveting workshop of the Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory, more than 400 types of work have been changed from manual operation to mechanical operation, with 149 items having increased efficiency by more than 20 times.

Because of the continuous improvement of labor productivity, many old balances have been broken and transformed into new imbalances. Therefore, the factories and mines in Zhangjiakou are actively strengthening organizational leadership and rationally adjusting labor organization to draw out surplus personnel to support areas where there are shortages, so that labor organization can adapt to new production requirements. After rectifying its organization, the Xuanhua Electrical Machinery Factory drew out 261 people to support fraternal factories. The Xuanhua Magnet Factory reduced its labor force by 267 people, but the output value in the first quarter will still double compared with the same period last year.

As the movement has been widely and deeply carried out, the "One Tops Two Five Eight" red flag competition is no longer limited to workshops, teams, and individuals within factories, but has further set off a competition between factories, between the same types of work, the same businesses, and small factories promoting large factories. At present, 84 units have launched challenge and response competitions between factories.

### 巧干潜力大　一人顶多人  张家口开展技术革命运动二十个单位提前完成首季任务

    巧干潜力大　一人顶多人
    张家口开展技术革命运动二十个单位提前完成首季任务
    本报张家口26日电　张家口市工业战线上的职工，轰轰烈烈地开展以技术革命为中心的“一顶二五八”（就是一个人做两个人的工作、做五个人的工作、做八个人的工作）红旗竞赛，超额完成了1、2月份的生产计划；到3月20日，全市又有下花园煤矿等二十个单位，提前完成了第一季度生产任务。
    “一顶二五八”红旗竞赛是在去年大跃进中总结出来的一种提高劳动生产率的群众运动。在去年6月份，探矿机械厂老工人赵富海、李天才和工段长冯宝融等人，作五百公尺钻机卷筒轴，通过改进技术，提高效率五十三倍；厂党委抓住这个先进事例，发动各车间、小组讨论，其中有人提出“一顶二五八红旗竞赛运动”。厂党委采纳了群众意见，在全厂开展了这一竞赛。由于这一竞赛效果很好，很快地就从探矿机械厂向全市各厂矿发展起来。今年，中共张家口市委在各厂矿发动群众继续开展了“一顶二五八”红旗竞赛。竞赛结果，有些厂矿由原来对完成1、2月份生产计划把握不大，一跃而超额完成了1、2月份生产计划。在竞赛中，各厂矿企业到处出现了大闹技术革命的生动局面。截至3月上半月，各厂矿企业、交通运输、基本建设等单位提出的技术措施共达九十多万件，对提高生产起了巨大作用。张家口矿山机械厂由于实现了群众提出的一千五百九十六项措施建议，3月份以来，达到“一顶二五八”的就有五千八百九十七人次，达到双台时的有一百零九台次，劳动生产率比2月份同期提高将近一倍，超额完成了上旬生产任务。张家口探矿机械厂锻铆车间有四百多种活已由手工操作变为机械操作，提高效率二十倍以上的就有一百四十九项。
    由于劳动生产率不断提高，许多旧的平衡被打破变为新的不平衡，因此，张家口市各厂矿积极从加强组织领导，合理调整劳动组织入手，抽出多余人员支援不足之处，使劳动组织适应新的生产要求。宣化机电厂经过整顿组织，抽出二百六十一人支援了兄弟厂。宣化磁厂劳动力缩减了二百六十七人，第一季度产值仍将比去年同期翻一番。
    由于运动的广泛深入开展，“一顶二五八”红旗竞赛已经不止限于厂内各车间、小组和个人之间，而是进一步掀起了厂与厂、同工种、同业务以及小厂促进大厂的竞赛。现在，厂际之间开展着挑战应战竞赛的已经有八十四个单位。
