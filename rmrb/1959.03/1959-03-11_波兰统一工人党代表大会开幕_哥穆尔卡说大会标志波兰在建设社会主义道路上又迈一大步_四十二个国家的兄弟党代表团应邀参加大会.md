Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 10th. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party solemnly opened at 10:00 this morning in the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw.

The atmosphere inside the venue was solemn and warm. On the front of the rostrum, which was covered with red flags, hung portraits of revolutionary teachers Marx and Lenin. The hall was filled with over 1,400 delegates.

Leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by the First Secretary of the Central Committee, Gomulka, and members of the fraternal party delegations from various countries, ascended the rostrum, at which point the entire hall stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

Gomulka presided over the opening of the congress. As Gomulka walked to the podium, the entire hall stood up and sang "The Internationale" in unison. The common voice of communists from different countries resounded throughout the hall.

Gomulka delivered the opening address, saying: We look back on the past with pride, and we look at the present with pride.

He then said that the United Workers' Party had undertaken the difficult and glorious task in history of realizing the ideal of building socialism in Poland. For fourteen years, we have been struggling and working for this goal with the working class and all working people.

Gomulka emphasized that our congress today is another great step forward along the road of building socialism in Poland.

At Gomulka's suggestion, the entire hall stood up and observed a moment of silence for Polish United Workers' Party activists, including Beirut, who had passed away since the last congress.

Gomulka announced the fraternal party delegations that had been invited to attend the congress. When he announced the delegations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, the entire hall stood up and applauded enthusiastically for several minutes. The hall responded with prolonged applause when the delegations of the Italian, French, and Spanish Communist Parties were announced. The congress also welcomed the delegation of the Cuban People's Socialist Party with particularly warm applause.

Gomulka repeatedly expressed a warm welcome to the fraternal party delegations from more than forty countries who had come to attend the congress.
