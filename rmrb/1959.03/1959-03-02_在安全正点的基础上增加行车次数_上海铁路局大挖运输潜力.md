    Shanghai, March 1st (report from our newspaper) The Shanghai Railway Bureau is actively tapping transportation potential and implementing high-density train operations. On the basis of punctual and safe operations, it can pass more trains without adding a lot of equipment.
    High-density train operation is to increase the number of train runs as much as possible according to the line's capacity to handle trains. Since the implementation of high-density train operation on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Pukou-Bengbu lines more than a month ago, the average number of trains traveling to and from each day has reached 248, an increase of more than 30% compared with the same period last year. The train density reached its peak before the Spring Festival. The maximum train capacity is 84 trains per day. On the Shanghai-Wuxi section of the Shanghai-Nanjing line, up to 78 trains were operated in one day, with a utilization rate of 93%, creating an unprecedented record. On average, a train passed through each station in less than 20 minutes. Due to the implementation of high-density train operation, although the passenger volume during the Spring Festival increased by one time compared with normal times, the goods could still be transported in time.
    The key to ensuring high-density train operation is the punctuality and safety of train operation. With more trains running on the line, any delay or accident of a train will affect the overall situation. Therefore, since early January, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has launched a "Safety and Punctuality Campaign." All employees have received a good education on punctuality and safety through great airing of views, great debates, and have established and improved a series of systems to ensure punctual and safe operation. In the month from January 10 to February 10, the punctuality rate of trains in this bureau increased by 16% compared with December last year, and accidents also decreased by 23%.
    Recently, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has selected more than 20 small stations with longer distances between two stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Pu-Bengbu and other lines, laid parking sidings, and set up signal machines and other equipment. Originally, only one train could run between two major stations, but now two trains can run at the same time, and the trains will meet at these intermediate small stations, thus greatly shortening the stopping time.

### 在安全正点的基础上增加行车次数  上海铁路局大挖运输潜力

    在安全正点的基础上增加行车次数
    上海铁路局大挖运输潜力
    本报上海1日电　上海铁路局积极挖掘运输潜力，实行高密度行车。在正点、安全运行的基础上，不用增加很多设备，就使铁路通过更多的列车。
    高密度行车是根据线路可以通过列车的能力，尽可能增加行车的次数。沪宁、沪杭、浙赣、浦（口）蚌（埠）等线最近一个多月实行高密度行车以来，平均每天来往的列车达到二百四十八列，比去年同期增加30％以上。春节前夕行车密度达到最高峰。列车最大通过能力为每天八十四列。沪宁线上海至无锡区段，最多一天开了七十八列，利用率达到93％，创造了空前纪录，每个车站平均不到二十分钟就通过一列火车。由于实行高密度行车，今年春节前后客运量虽比平时增加一倍，货物仍能及时运送。
    保证高密度行车的关键是列车运行的正点和安全。线路上运行的列车增多，任何一次列车的误点或发生事故都要影响全局。因此上海铁路局从1月上旬起开展了“安全正点运动”，全体职工经过大鸣大放，大辩论，受到了一次很好的正点安全教育，建立和健全了一系列保证正点安全运行的制度。在1月10日到2月10日的一个月内，这个局列车正点率比去年12月份提高16％，事故也减少23％。
    最近上海铁路局在沪宁、浦蚌等线上选择两站间距离较长的地方设立了二十多个小站，铺设停车股道，设置信号机等设备。原来两大站间只能行驶一列火车，现在可同时行驶两列，列车就在这些中间小站会让，因此大大缩短了停车时间。
