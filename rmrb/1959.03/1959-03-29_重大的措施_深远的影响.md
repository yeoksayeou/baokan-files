Major Measures, Far-Reaching Impact
Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

More than ten thousand cadres from Jiangxi have been sent to work in mountainous areas for over a year now. Having tens of thousands of cadres participate in labor and production in mountainous regions has effectively strengthened the connection between the Party and the masses and greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and their confidence in building the mountains. At the same time, significant achievements have been made in transforming and improving cadres and in developing the mountain economy.

Jiangxi Province is a province with many mountainous areas. The vast mountainous areas have fertile land and abundant resources. At the same time, the vast majority of mountainous areas in Jiangxi were old revolutionary base areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, making tremendous contributions to the Chinese revolution and suffering cruel massacres and devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Therefore, comprehensively developing the mountain economy and accelerating the construction of mountainous areas are important components of Jiangxi's great cause of building socialism, as well as glorious political and economic tasks.

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and Party committees and governments at all levels throughout the province have always regarded restoring and developing mountain production and accelerating mountain construction as serious political and economic tasks. As a result, mountain production throughout the province has greatly developed, various construction undertakings in mountainous areas have achieved great success, and the material and cultural living standards of the mountain people have been considerably improved and raised.

In the winter of 1957, in order to more comprehensively develop the mountain economy, accelerate the socialist construction of mountainous areas, and at the same time, to train and transform cadres, a surge of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside was set off on the basis of the victory of the all-people rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. During this surge, more than 50,000 cadres across the province went up to the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in labor and production. After a large number of cadres went up to the mountains, more than 150 state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms were quickly established in sparsely populated deep mountains, dense forests, and barren red soil lands. This closely integrated the transferred cadres with the comprehensive development of the mountain economy. In the people's commune movement of 1958, in some areas with abundant timber resources and sparse populations, a group of agricultural cooperatives directly merged or transformed into reclamation farms according to the needs of production and the demands of the masses, thus giving state-owned reclamation farms greater development. Practice over the past year has proven that comprehensive reclamation farms composed of tens of thousands of transferred cadres as the core are not only a new type of state-owned agricultural enterprise economic organization, but also a new type of revolutionary school for cultivating and training cadres.

Although the reclamation farms established by the transferred cadres across the province have been established for a short time, they have followed the principle of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture and comprehensively managing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In 1958, all production undertakings achieved leaps and bounds in development. Last year, the total output value of the province's reclamation farms reached more than 87.9 million yuan, and the average output value per person, calculated based on the original number of people in the reclamation farms, was 635 yuan. The area of wasteland reclaimed by the reclamation farms was 280,000 mu, more than double the total area of wasteland reclaimed in the province in 1957. The production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, fruit trees, silkworms, tea, and other various cash crops in the reclamation farms has greatly developed. The area afforested by the reclamation farms was 697,000 mu, nearly double the total area of state-owned afforestation in 1957. The animal husbandry and aquaculture industries of the reclamation farms have also developed rapidly and are gradually forming a strong base for the province's animal husbandry and aquaculture industries. The reclamation farms have also developed timber processing industry, paper industry, wood fiber industry, forest chemical industry, and oil pressing and brewing industries according to local conditions. More than 5,600 small factories of various types have been built in the province's reclamation farms. More than 40 small hydropower and thermal power stations have been built or are under construction. Significant results have also been achieved in the research and utilization of various inexhaustible and inexhaustible wild plants in mountainous areas.

Due to the transfer of tens of thousands of cadres to mountainous areas and the establishment of a large number of reclamation farms, profound changes are taking place in the mountainous areas. Last year, the province built more than 1,700 kilometers of mountain roads and simple roads, exceeding the total mileage of roads built in the province during the First Five-Year Plan period. 350 kilometers of bamboo and wood tracks were built, and a large number of bamboo and wood slides and aerial ropeways were also built, and a large number of river dredging and reef blasting were carried out to open up mountain waterways. Last year, the reclamation farms established 76 communist labor universities and 52 labor technical schools in mountainous areas, with a total of more than 42,000 young students from all over the province and some neighboring provinces studying and working at the general school of communist labor universities and various branch schools, setting an example for the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's policy of "combining education with productive labor." Under the promotion and guidance of the reclamation farms and labor universities, spare-time education, literacy campaigns, and various cultural and recreational activities among the broad masses in mountainous areas have also flourished. The reclamation farms have established 100 botanical and zoological research gardens, and 386 research projects were carried out last year. With the development of reclamation farms, a total of 371 new mountain hospitals, health centers, and medical stations were built last year, and free treatment was generally provided to the poor people in mountainous areas. Mountain business, banking, and postal and telecommunications services have also grown enormously.

Over the past year or so, after tens of thousands of cadres went up to the mountains and down to the countryside, on the one hand, the mental outlook of these cadres has undergone profound changes; on the other hand, it has had a tremendous impact on society. These influences have played a tremendous role in inspiring cadres and the work of agencies at all levels throughout the province, as well as the broad masses in mountainous areas. What is particularly important is that it has further strengthened the connection between the Party and the masses and between cadres and the masses. The broad masses of the people have praised our cadres as worthy of being good students educated by the Communist Party, capable of going up and down, capable of both literary and military skills, and capable of being both "officials" and common people.

In the actual test of labor and life over the past year or so, it has shown that the majority of comrades among the tens of thousands of cadres enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government and left their familiar cities, agencies, factories, and schools to participate in labor and production in unfamiliar and remote mountainous areas, not simply to obey the allocation of the organization, but because they have a high degree of patriotism and communist consciousness. Although they knew that after going up to the mountains, they would live in thatched huts, live a more difficult life, and endure the test of physical labor. However, they were not frightened by these temporary difficulties, but bravely went to the mountains, went to life, and went to glorious labor positions. In labor, the vast majority of comrades demonstrated the heroic spirit of communism and the revolutionary spirit of optimism. In the uninhabited mountains, socialist labor enthusiasm and heroic singing were everywhere, creating many miracles and appearing many exciting examples. They developed the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, love of labor, contact with the masses, and diligence and simplicity with each other, regardless of the level of their past positions. In labor, they learned from the capable, helped each other, learned from each other, made progress together, and humbly learned from local farmers. Many of them have begun to develop a habit of loving labor, and some comrades said: "I feel uncomfortable all over if I don't work for a day." In this great communist torrent, all temporary difficulties were placed in an insignificant position, and some individualism that valued reputation and status and valued enjoyment was drowned out by the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses. This is exactly the case: people are constantly transforming themselves in the struggle to transform nature. According to incomplete statistics from 125 reclamation farms, the number of labor models and advanced workers that have emerged in the past year has reached 2,993.

Now, an extremely important task of Party committees at all levels is to strengthen the education, training, and improvement of tens of thousands of cadres in the province's reclamation farms. We must understand that the tens of thousands of cadres and demobilized officers who are now participating in production labor in mountainous areas were and still are valuable assets of the Party and the country. The great cause of building socialism and communism requires a large number of cadres who are both red and expert, trained and able to withstand risks. The Party's decision to send a large number of cadres to mountainous areas to participate in labor and training is an important policy for accelerating socialist construction and cultivating and training cadres, and it is also a fundamental system of socialism. This is to train the broad cadres of our province into communist fighters who are both red and expert and combine physical labor and mental labor. Among the tens of thousands of transferred cadres, after more than a year of actual labor, many people have been well trained, they understand or have begun to understand certain labor skills, have revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative, and have the determination and certain practical skills to realize communist ideals. With the need for reclamation farms to develop production and build mountainous areas, these comrades should be boldly promoted to assume certain leadership positions based on the principle of both ability and political integrity. As for those who do not perform well in labor, no matter how high their past positions and culture were, they should be honestly allowed to continue to train.

Practice over the past year or so has proven that cadres participating in labor and production is an effective measure to train and improve cadres and improve work style, and it is a broad road for cadres to become both red and expert. The reclamation farms established by the transferred cadres throughout the province, because they have strong leadership and are units that combine multiple operations, are conducive to cultivating talents in all aspects, and are also conducive to the cultivation and improvement of cadres, so it is a political school for training and improving cadres, and it is a good place to realize the combination of mental labor and physical labor.

Past year's practice has proved that the Party Central Committee's instructions on cadres going down and cadres participating in physical labor is entirely correct; Jiangxi's practice of combining the development of mountainous areas and sending cadres to mountainous areas to establish state-owned reclamation farms is also entirely correct. This important measure has had a tremendous impact on Jiangxi and will continue to have its far-reaching impact.

    重大的措施  深远的影响
    中共江西省委书记　刘俊秀
    江西数万名干部下放山区，到现在已经一年多了。数万干部下放到山区参加劳动生产，有效地增强了党与群众的联系，大大激发了广大人民群众的革命干劲和建设山区的信心。同时，在改造、提高干部方面，在开发山区经济方面，都取得了显著的成绩。
    江西省是一个山区较多的省份。广大山区土地肥沃，资源丰富；同时，江西广大山区绝大多数都是第二次国内革命战争时期的老革命根据地，为中国革命作过巨大的贡献，也遭受过国民党反动派的残酷屠杀与摧残。所以，全面开发山区经济，加速山区的建设，是江西建设社会主义伟大事业中的一个重要的组成部分，也是一项光荣的政治任务和经济任务。
    解放以来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，省委、省人民委员会和全省各级党委、各级政府，从来就把恢复和发展山区生产，加速山区建设，作为一项严重的政治任务和经济任务。因此，全省山区的生产有了很大的发展，山区的各项建设事业获得了很大的成就，山区人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平，也有了相当的改善和提高。
    1957年冬季，为了更全面地开发山区经济，加速山区的社会主义建设，同时为了锻炼和改造干部，在全民整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，掀起了一个干部上山下乡的热潮。在这个热潮中，全省共有五万多干部上山下乡参加劳动生产。大批干部上山后，在人烟稀少的深山密林中和红土荒山上，很快地建立起了一百五十多个国营综合垦殖场。这样就把下放干部和全面开发山区经济紧密地结合起来了。在1958年人民公社化运动中，在一些林木资源丰富而人口较少的地方，根据生产的需要和群众的要求，有一批农业社直接并入或者转化为垦殖场，从而使国营垦殖场有了更大的发展。一年来的实践证明，以几万下放干部为核心组成的综合垦殖场，不仅是一种新型的国营农业企业经济组织，而且还是一种新型的培养和锻炼干部的革命学校。
    全省下放干部建立的垦殖场，虽然创立的时间都很短，但是，它们根据工农业同时并举和农林牧副渔综合经营的方针，在1958年，各项生产事业都有了突飞猛进的发展。去年全省垦殖场的生产总值达到了八千七百九十多万元，按垦殖场原有人数计算，每人的平均产值为六百三十五元。垦殖场开垦荒地的面积有二十八万亩，比1957年全省的开荒总面积增加了两倍多。垦殖场粮食、棉花、油料、果木、蚕桑、茶叶以及其他各种经济作物的生产，都有很大的发展。垦殖场完成造林面积有六十九万七千亩，比1957年国营造林总面积增加了将近一倍。各垦殖场的畜牧业和水产业也发展得很快，正逐渐形成为全省畜牧业和水产业的强大基地。各垦殖场还因地制宜地发展了木材加工工业、造纸工业、木材纤维工业、林产化学工业和榨油酿酒工业。全省各垦殖场已经建成的各种小型工厂有五千六百多个。已经建成或正在兴建的小型水力、火力发电站有四十多处。对于山区各种取之不尽、用之不竭的野生植物的研究和利用，也取得了显著的成效。
    由于几万干部下放山区和大批垦殖场的建立，山区的面貌正在发生着深刻的变化。全省去年一年修建的山区公路和简易公路有一千七百多公里，超过了第一个五年计划期间全省修建公路的总里程，修建的竹木轨道有三百五十多公里，还大量地修建了竹木滑道和架空索道，大量地进行了疏河炸礁、开辟山区航道。各垦殖场去年一年在山区创办了七十六所共产主义劳动大学和五十二所劳动技术学校，共有四万二千多名来自全省各地和一部分邻省的青年学生，在共产主义劳动大学总校与各分校学习和劳动，为正确地贯彻执行党中央关于“教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针树立了榜样。在各垦殖场和劳动大学的推动和辅导下，山区广大群众中的业余教育、扫盲运动和各种文化娱乐活动，也有了蓬勃的发展。各垦殖场建立了动植物研究园一百所，去年进行的各种研究项目有三百八十六个。随着垦殖场的发展，去年新建的山区医院、卫生所、医疗站共有三百七十一个，并且普遍举办了对山区贫苦群众的免费治疗。山区的商业、银行业、邮电等事业，也有巨大的发展。
    一年多来，几万干部上山下乡后，一方面这些干部的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化；另一方面，在社会上造成了巨大的影响。这些影响，对于全省干部和各级机关的工作，对于山区广大人民，起了巨大的鼓舞作用。特别重要的是，进一步密切了党与群众、干部与群众之间的联系。广大人民群众纷纷赞扬我们的干部不愧是共产党教育出来的好学生，能上能下，能文能武，能“官”能民。
    在一年多来的劳动与生活的实际考验中，表明几万干部中间的多数同志，他们之所以热烈响应党和政府的号召，离开他们所熟悉的城市、机关、工厂和学校，前往陌生的偏远的山区参加劳动生产，并不简单地只是为了服从组织的分配，而是由于有高度的爱国主义精神和共产主义觉悟。他们虽然知道，上山之后将住茅棚，过着较为艰苦的生活，经受着体力劳动的考验。但是，他们没有被这些暂时的困难所吓倒，而勇敢地走向山区，走向生活，走向光荣的劳动岗位。在劳动中，绝大多数同志表现了共产主义的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义精神，在荒无人烟的崇山峻岭中，到处都洋溢着社会主义的劳动热情和英雄豪迈的歌声，创造了许多奇迹，出现了许多动人心弦的范例。他们互相之间，不分过去职位的高低，都发扬了团结互助、热爱劳动、联系群众、勤俭朴素的精神。在劳动中，以能者为师，互相帮助，互相学习，共同进步，并且虚心向当地农民学习。他们中间的许多人，已开始养成了热爱劳动的习惯，有的同志说：“一天不劳动，浑身不舒服”。在这股伟大的共产主义的洪流里，一切暂时的困难都被置于不在话下的地位，一些计较名誉地位、计较享受待遇的个人主义，被广大群众的劳动热情所淹没了。事情正是这样：人们在不断地改造自然界的斗争中，也不断地改造着人们自己。据一百二十五个垦殖场的不完全统计，一年来出现的劳动模范和先进工作者即达二千九百九十三人。
    现在，各级党委一项极其重要的任务就是：加强对全省垦殖场几万干部的教育、锻炼和提高。必须了解，现在在山区参加生产劳动的几万干部和转业军官，过去是、今后也仍然是党和国家的宝贵财产。建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，需要大量又红又专的、经过锻炼和经得起风险的干部。党决定把大批干部下放到山区参加劳动锻炼，是加速社会主义建设、培养和锻炼干部的一项重要政策，也是社会主义的一个根本制度。这是为了把我省的广大干部锻炼成为又红又专的、体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的共产主义战士。在几万下放干部中，经过一年多来的实际劳动，许多人锻炼得很好，他们通晓或者开始通晓某些劳动技能，有革命热情和主动精神，具有为实现共产主义理想的决心和某些实际本领。随着垦殖场发展生产、建设山区的需要，应当根据德才兼备的原则，大胆地提拔这些同志去担负一定的领导工作。而对于那些在劳动中表现不好的人，不管他过去的职位和文化多高，应该让他们老老实实地继续去锻炼。
    一年多来的实践证明，干部参加劳动生产，是锻炼提高干部、改进工作作风的有效措施，是干部走向又红又专的康庄大道。全省下放干部建立的垦殖场，由于有较强的领导，又是多种经营相结合的单位，因此，有利于培养各方面的人才，也有利于干部的培养和提高，所以它是锻炼提高干部的政治学校，是实现脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的良好场所。
    过去一年来的实践证明：党中央关于干部下放、干部参加体力劳动的指示是完全正确的；江西结合开发山区，把干部下放到山区建立国营垦殖场的作法，也是完全对的。这一重要的措施，在江西已产生了巨大的影响，并将继续产生其深远的影响。
