Early Spring in Baisha
He Shihong

Not long ago, spring – a season full of the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward – has arrived in the world. Look, the willows on both sides of the Baisha River have sprouted tender buds, the small peach blossoms by the pond have swelled with buds, the flowing water ripples with spring waves and slowly flows eastward, the golden rapeseed flowers in the fields have already bloomed, and the lush green wheat and broad bean seedlings are spread out like green felt blankets...

One only speaks of spring arriving early, but people are even earlier than spring. In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party, the people of Baisha District displayed soaring enthusiasm, and the average yield of grain per mu in the district exceeded 1,000 jin. However, the people of Baisha are by no means complacent, and they are determined to make even greater achievements in 1959. District Party Secretary Wang Sijiu is still so spirited, cheerful and young. As soon as you enter the gate of the District Committee and talk to him about the production situation this year, he will tell you with enthusiasm: "This year is a decisive year. We will never relax. The people of the whole district must create high-yield demonstration plots with a yield of 15,000 jin per mu, and strive for an average grain yield of 3,000 jin per mu." Yes, the words of the Party Committee have always been fulfilled. As soon as the new year began, the whole district organized a large number of laborers to vigorously engage in farmland water conservancy and strengthen the field management of winter crops. Baisha Commune alone has more than 80 professional management teams. From Shangba to Xiaba, people are everywhere, singing is heard everywhere, and everywhere are people weeding rapeseed, hoeing wheat, spreading grass ash, and accumulating fertilizer. It is truly a lively scene. As Zuo Zaie, the head of the Youth Farm, said:
	“These days, managing the minor spring crops is really turning the soil upside down!” The management areas of the Baisha Brigade have generally been weeded and hoed twice. The Japanese rapeseed and Nanda No. 24 wheat in the experimental fields of the commune's cadres and the high-yield experimental plots of Gulin No. 5 Middle School have been fertilized five to six times. The fertile seedlings grow especially lovely and are second to none in the whole dam area. In mid-January, the Gulin County Party Committee held an on-site meeting on the management of minor spring crops in Baisha Dam, calling on the people of the county to learn from the people of Baisha in managing the minor spring crops like embroidery and watering and fertilizing the field crops like feeding babies. Yes, only with such meticulous work can amazing miracles be created.

Throughout the winter, the people of Baisha have been training. The militiamen, regardless of the muddy roads and the freezing cold below zero degrees, get up early in the morning to drill. The Baisha Dam, the Xiaobao fields, and the school playgrounds are filled with the crisp sound of whistles and the sound of orderly footsteps. After two or three months of training, even the sisters and girls who have never done "foreign exercises" walk with "cha, cha, cha" footsteps. Who says women can't be soldiers? Who says "mares can't go into battle"? Standing in front of them, you can't help but praise them as Hua Mulan and Mu Guiying.

On the Baisha Dam, a straight road runs directly through it. The unfinished road is full of bustling crowds, who are working hard to complete the construction and strive to open it to the city in March. For several months, even during the tense period of the Great Leap Forward in Steel, when the daily production of pig iron reached 21,000 tons, the District Committee said that the "pioneer officer" could not be abandoned, and the "marshals" could not be left as "bare commanders." The road still organized a long-term road construction team of more than 200 people to persist in construction. After the beginning of spring, the labor force increased, and the road construction workers displayed their infinite wisdom, creating a method of using river sand mixed with gunpowder to fill the blasting holes, saving 50% of the gunpowder. Now, the road has not only realized the use of vehicles, but also changed the original mountain chiseling line to a straight line across the middle of the field dam, which greatly saves labor, money and time, and makes the progress about 40% faster than the same projects in other districts. At the same time, in the future, the road can also be used to transport fertilizer directly to the fields by car.

At the county's transportation work evaluation meeting, the heroic deeds of the people of Baisha in vigorously developing transportation won unanimous praise.

Throughout the upper, middle, and lower dam areas, the wheat seedlings are green, the rapeseed is green, and the shining winter water fields are like bright mirrors. In these crisscrossing fields, there are piles of white things everywhere, like dust scattered under the starry sky. Upon asking, it was learned that this was the natural fertilizer accumulated after the Spring Festival. In order to maintain the fertilizer effect, the commune members smeared it with thin mud and sprinkled lime on it. More than 30,000 jin of fertilizer have been applied per mu. Do you think this is already a lot? No, it is still far from the 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu proposed by the District Committee. What to do? The situation is forcing people to find ways. Young farmer Chen Xiangru saw the experience of making local chemical fertilizer introduced in the Gulin Newspaper. With the support of the commune party committee, they used three tile houses, two large pots, several buckets, and two pits by the Longtang to start a great undertaking. They boiled out "hair light liquid" according to the ratio of one jin of hair, four jin of water, one qian of sulfuric acid, four liang of lime, and two liang of caustic soda. In addition to this, they also successfully tested nearly ten kinds of chemical fertilizers such as humic acid, potassium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, potassium-magnesium fertilizer, and self-generated nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Now, this comprehensive chemical fertilizer plant located on the edge of Longtang has produced tens of thousands of jin of chemical fertilizer. They are testing more varieties and preparing to meet the county party committee's on-site chemical fertilizer meeting here with higher output.

The Baisha River meanders through the mountain basin, but once it passes through the rock layers of Dongliangzi, it changes its gentle and tranquil posture and pours down a hundred-zhang-high cliff with the roar of surging waves. The Baisha Power Station is built here, leaning against the mountain and facing the water, chiseling rocks, and using this natural resource to transmit electricity to the commune members. At night, the streets of Baisha are as bright as day, and the sleepless red light above Dongliangzi is like a lighthouse in the sea, forever tirelessly illuminating the people in the mountainous areas. The warm spring breeze gently strokes the black hair and skirts of the girls in the fields. In the winter water fields, the District Committee's major spring production technology training class is experimenting with seed sowing machines and seedling field leveling and furrowing machines. Some commune members are selecting seeds, and some are engaged in warm room cultivation of sweet potato seedlings. It seems that all combat preparations have been completed, and an even greater spring offensive is about to begin...

    白沙春早
    何世红
    曾几何时，春——这充满跃进气氛的季节已来到了人间。你看，白沙河两岸的杨柳已经发出了嫩芽，池边的小桃花已鼓起了花蕾，流水泛起春波缓缓往东流去，田野里金黄的菜子花已经开了，绿油油的小麦、葫豆秧，也铺成了一块块绿色的毡毯……。
    只道春来早，人却早过春。1958年，白沙区的人民在党的英明领导下发挥了冲天的干劲，全区粮食平均亩产超过千斤，但是白沙人绝不自满，他们一心要在1959年内做出更大的成绩。区委书记王思九同志还是那么意气风发，爽朗年青，一走进区委会的大门和他谈到今年生产情况的时候，他就会热情奔放的告诉你：“今年是个决战年，我们决不松劲，全区人民一定要搞亩产一万五千斤的高额丰产地，要争取粮食平均亩产三千斤。”是的，党委的话素来是说得到就办得到的。新年一过，全区就组织了大批劳力大搞农田水利，加强冬季作物的田间管理，单白沙公社就有八十多个管理专业队。从上坝到下坝，遍地人群，歌声四起，到处都是薅菜子的、?小麦的、撒草灰的和积肥料的，真是人喧马叫，热闹非凡。正如青年农场场长左在娥说的：
  “这两天管小春，硬是地皮都闹翻了！”白沙大队的管理区普遍已薅?两道。公社的干部试验田和古蔺五中高产实验地里的日本油菜和南大二四小麦，已经施肥五至六遍，那肥嫩的秧苗长得特别可爱，在全坝子说来都是数一数二的。元月中旬，古蔺县委在白沙坝子上召开了小春生产管理现场会，号召全县人民学习白沙人民像绣花一样的管理小春，像喂娃娃一样为田间作物浇水施肥。是的，只有如是精心细作，才会创造出惊人的奇迹。
    整个冬天，白沙人民都在练兵。民兵们不顾稀泥烂窖和零度以下的严寒，一大早就起来操练。白沙坝上、小堡田间以及学校的操场上，到处传来清脆的哨子声和整齐的步伐声。经过两三个月的锻炼以后，连那些从未下过“洋操”的嫂子、姑娘们，脚步也走得“嚓、嚓、嚓”的了。谁说女人不能当兵？谁说“母马上不得阵”？站在她们的面前不由得你不称赞她们是花木兰、是穆桂英。
    白沙坝上，一条笔直的公路直通其间。未完成的公路上到处是熙熙攘攘的人群，他们正在紧张的进行施工，争取3月份通车到城里。几个月来，即使是在大搞钢铁运动中，日产生铁达到两万一千吨那么紧张的时刻，区委也说不能丢掉“先行官”，让“元帅”们当“光杆司令”。公路上照样组织了二百多人的长期筑路队坚持施工。入春以后，劳力加多了，筑路工人们发挥了无穷的智慧，创造用河沙夹火药装填炮眼的办法，节省了50％的火药。现在公路上不但实现了车子化，而且使原来依山凿岩的线路改为直道横贯田坝中间，既大大的节省了劳力、财力和时间，使进度比其它区同样工程快到40％左右，同时将来还可利用公路把肥料直接车运到田里。
    在全县交通工作评比会议上，白沙人民大搞交通的英雄事迹获得了一致的好评。
    整个上、中、下坝，麦苗碧绿，油菜青青，那亮晃晃的冬水田有如明镜。在这一丘丘纵横交错的田里，到处都有几堆白白的东西，犹如满天星斗下布凡尘。一问之下，才知这是春节后积的自然肥。社员们为了保持肥效，用稀泥糊上，还在上面撒上了石灰。每亩地已经施肥三万余斤，你以为这已经很多了吧？不，距离区委提出的每亩施肥十万斤还差得远呢？怎么办呢？形势逼着人去想方设法。青年农民陈相如看到古蔺报上介绍制造土化肥的经验，他们十多人在公社党委的支持下，利用龙塘边三间瓦房，两口大锅，几个桶桶，两个坑坑就干起大事来了。他们按一斤头发、四斤水、一钱硫酸、四两石灰、二两烧碱的比例就熬出了“毛发淡液”。除此而外还试验成功了胡敏酸、硫酸钾、硫酸錏、钾镁肥、自生固氮菌等近十种化肥。现在，这座坐落在龙塘边的综合化肥厂已经生产化肥上万斤，他们正在试制更多的品种并准备以更高的产量去迎接县委在这里召开的化肥现场会。
    白沙河蜿蜒曲折地流过山间盆地，但一穿过洞梁子的岩层，却一变那温柔恬静的姿态，以奔腾澎湃的吼声注下百丈高的悬岩。白沙发电站便在这儿依山傍水，凿岩而建，利用这天然的资源为社员们输送电流。入夜，白沙街上通明如昼，洞梁子上面那盏不眠的红灯却像大海中的灯塔一样，永远不知疲倦地照耀着山区人民。春天的暖风轻轻地抚弄着田野里姑娘们的黑发和衣裙。冬水田里，区委举办的大春生产技术训练班正在试验洒谷机和秧田平整开厢器，社员们有的在选种，有的在搞暖室培植苕秧，看来，一切战斗准备工作已经就绪，更大的春季攻势即将开始……
