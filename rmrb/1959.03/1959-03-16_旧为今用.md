　　Using the Old for the Present
　　Qin Li
　　I saw a picture album in Shanghai called "Shanghai Then and Now". This picture album doesn't seem particularly novel on the surface, but it is very eye-catching. When placed in a bookstore, everyone wants to flip through it.
　　It turns out that its editing method is quite unique. Each page has two kinds of photos, one from the past and one from the present. The same location, two different faces; comparing the past and present, a world of difference. For example, the stinking waterfront teeming with mosquitoes and flies in the past has now become a wide and broad avenue; the Bund Park, which used to have a sign saying "Dogs and Chinese not allowed," is now a place for working people to relax; the worker Ju Yongkang, whose family of three generations had lived on a dilapidated boat in the Suzhou River for thirty-one years, has now moved into the spacious and bright Caoyang New Village; ... There are also some historically significant pictures, such as the scene of Nanjing Road on the day of the "May 30th" massacre, leaving irrefutable ironclad evidence of the bloody crimes of the imperialists.
　　This kind of comparative picture editing method has also been seen in newspapers and magazines, but it is rare to compile it into a picture album. In some large and medium-sized cities, a considerable amount of photographic data is preserved, many of which are very precious and record important historical events. If we can, like the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, compile and publish them so that dead materials can be used for the present, so that readers can look back on the past and think about the present (in fact, if you don't see those photos, many things in people's memories have been gradually diluted, or even almost forgotten, by the new life and new appearance), stimulate patriotic thinking, and encourage people to build a better life, it will be of great benefit.
　　Of course, this first requires the ingenuity of the editors.

    旧为今用
  　秦犁
    在上海看到一本画册：“上海今昔”。这本画册从外表上看，并无特别新奇之处，但却十分引人注意，放在书店里，谁都要去翻它一翻。
    原来，它的编辑方法比较别致，在每一页上都有两种照片，一是过去的，一是现在的。同一地点，两般面目；今昔对比，天壤立辨。例如过去的蚊蝇丛生的臭水滨，今日已成广道宽衢；过去挂着“狗与华人不准入内”牌子的外滩公园，今日成为劳动人民游憩之所；工人居永康，三十一年来祖孙三代一直住在苏州河里的破船上，现在已经搬进宽敞明亮的曹扬新村；……这里面还有一些有历史意义的图片，例如“五卅”惨案那天的南京路的镜头，为帝国主义者的血腥罪行留下永远抵赖不了的铁证。
    这种对比式的图片编辑法，在报纸杂志上也曾见过，但是编成画册，却还不多见。在一些大、中城市里，保留着相当多的照片资料，其中有不少是十分珍贵、记录下重要的历史事件的资料。如果像上海人民美术出版社这样，编印出版，让死的资料能为今用，使读者能够抚今思昔（实在的，如果不看到那些照片，有许多事在人们的记忆里，已经被新的生活、新的面貌冲击得逐渐淡薄，甚至几乎忘怀了），激发爱国主义思想，鼓舞人们建设更加美好的生活，是大有好处的。
    自然，这首先需要编辑人的匠心。
