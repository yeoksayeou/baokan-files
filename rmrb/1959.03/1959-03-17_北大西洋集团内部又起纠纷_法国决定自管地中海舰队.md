	Internal Disputes Within the North Atlantic Group Arise Again
	France Decides to Manage its Mediterranean Fleet Independently

	This newspaper reports that the French government under de Gaulle has thrown another bombshell within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On March 13, the French government formally notified the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, demanding that its fleet in the Mediterranean, whether in peacetime or in the event of war, be commanded by France and not controlled by the "International Command."

	According to the North Atlantic Treaty, in peacetime, the naval forces of "allied countries" can be commanded by their respective national commanders. However, in the event of war, a portion of the French fleet in the Mediterranean should be commanded by the British Admiral based in Malta. Now, France is demanding that its fleet be managed by the French themselves at all times. According to the Associated Press, France's decision "virtually cancels all obligations of its Mediterranean fleet to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," thus "leading to intense behind-the-scenes struggles within the Atlantic Alliance."

	The French government's reason for doing so is that France bears "special responsibility" in the Western Mediterranean, namely, conducting the colonial war in Algeria. However, according to many Western news agencies, this actually demonstrates France's "fundamental dissatisfaction with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," particularly "further actions taken because the United States and Britain have taken no action on his proposal for the three countries to jointly formulate a global plan." It is known that as early as half a year ago, de Gaulle wrote to Eisenhower and Macmillan, requesting the establishment of a "US-UK-France triumvirate core" within the North Atlantic Group, so that France could be on an equal footing with the US and Britain. At the North Atlantic Group Council meeting last December, de Gaulle again discussed this issue with Dulles, insisting on sharing leadership with the US and Britain. At that time, Dulles remained evasive and perfunctory. He said that there was no need to establish a high-level core organization of the three countries, and the United States could regularly "consult" with the French Ambassador to Washington. This naturally could not satisfy de Gaulle. Since then, de Gaulle has continued to raise issues that embarrass the allies of the North Atlantic. When the United States wanted to establish missile bases in France, de Gaulle made a counter-demand to have control of the nuclear warheads. De Gaulle also demanded that the French fighter squadrons not be under the command of the North Atlantic Group Headquarters, and two months ago, he raised the above-mentioned issue of jurisdiction over the French fleet in the Mediterranean as a test, and notified his "allies" of the decision after "starting to mobilize its navy in the Mediterranean." The Associated Press said that this is a "go-it-alone challenging attitude" on the part of France. United Press International believes that this is to force the United States, Britain, and France to discuss sharing the "leadership core."

	The French decision caused a shock as soon as it was announced. The United States and Britain have expressed "unease" and "regret." American diplomats in Paris even said that at a time when "Western allies" are experiencing conflicts over the Berlin issue, France's move is "very annoying." It is said that the United States fears most that France's action will cause "other countries may one day follow its example. In that case, the core of the alliance will be destroyed" (Associated Press). Therefore, it is said that US President Eisenhower is personally handling this thorny issue. (Attached picture)

### 北大西洋集团内部又起纠纷  法国决定自管地中海舰队

    北大西洋集团内部又起纠纷
    法国决定自管地中海舰队
    本报讯　法国戴高乐政府在北大西洋集团内投了又一枚重磅炸弹。13日法国政府正式通知北大西洋公约组织理事会，要求把它在地中海的舰队无论在和平时期或者发生战争时都由法国指挥，而不交给“国际司令部”控制。
    按照北大西洋公约规定，在和平时期，“盟国”海军部队可以由所属各国司令指挥。但一旦发生战争时，法国一部分在地中海的舰队应该由驻马耳他基地的英国海军上将指挥。现在法国却要求不论在什么时候，法国的舰队都由法国人自己掌管。据美联社说：法国的决定“几乎取消了它的地中海舰队对北大西洋公约组织的全部义务”，因而“在大西洋联盟内部发生了激烈的幕后斗争”。
    法国政府提出这样做的理由是：法国在西地中海承担了“特殊的责任”，即在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争。但是据许多西方通讯社说，这实际上表现了法国“对北大西洋公约组织的根本不满”，特别是“由于美国和英国对于他的关于三国共同拟订全球计划的建议没有采取什么行动”而“采取的进一步做法”。人们知道，早在半年前，戴高乐就曾写信给艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦，要求在北大西洋集团里建立“美英法三巨头核心”，以便使法国和美英平起平坐。到去年12月北大西洋集团理事会会议时，戴高乐又和杜勒斯谈起这个问题，坚持要跟美英分享领导权。当时杜勒斯依然支吾其词，百般敷衍。他说不必建立三国高级的核心组织，可由美国跟法国驻华盛顿大使经常“磋商磋商”。这自然不能使戴高乐感到满足。戴高乐此后依然不断提出使北大西洋的盟国感到难堪的问题。当美国要在法国建立导弹基地时，戴高乐就提出反要求，要把核弹头由他来掌握。戴高乐还要求法国的战斗机队不归北大西洋集团司令部指挥，两个月前又提出了上面这个地中海法国舰队的统辖问题进行试探，而且是在“着手调动它在地中海的海军”之后把决定通知他的“盟国”。美联社说，这是法国的一种“单干的挑战态度”。合众国际社认为，这是为了迫使美国、英国和法国讨论分享“领导核心”的问题。
    法国的决定一宣布，立即引起了震动。美国和英国纷纷表示“不安”和“遗憾”。美国在巴黎的外交人士甚至说，在“西方盟国”正在柏林问题上发生矛盾时，法国这样做使人“很恼火”。据说美国最怕的是法国这样做，将使“其他国家可能有一天也会效法它。在那种情况下，联盟的核心将遭到毁灭”（美联社）。因此，据说美国总统艾森豪威尔正在亲自出马处理这个棘手问题。（附图片）
