    Industry-Commerce Collaboration Promotes Agricultural Mechanization
    Yian People's Commune Establishes Basic Industry
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Yian County in Heilongjiang Province has adopted the method of "industry-commerce collaboration to arm the countryside" and has established a set of basic industries for the rural people's communes, creating favorable conditions for realizing commune industrialization and agricultural factoryization.
    After the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, especially after the realization of rural people's communes, there was an urgent need to realize commune industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification as soon as possible. This put forward new problems for industrial production and commercial supply work, requiring the supply of more and newer means of production. According to the past methods, when the countryside needed agricultural tools and machinery, the commercial departments relied on purchasing and importing goods, directly supplying whatever was needed. This made the countryside rely on the cities for a long time and could not be self-reliant. This method of supplying from the "branches" could not guarantee that today's continuous leap forward in agricultural production would meet the new requirements for agricultural tools and machinery. Therefore, according to the instruction of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to "industry-commerce collaboration, arming the countryside," the county helped the people's communes to establish basic industries, implementing "two guarantees, three -izations, and ten assistances," namely: guaranteeing equipment and materials; supporting the realization of rope traction, rail transport, and water conservancy; helping the communes establish power stations, machinery repair plants, grain and rice processing plants, feed crushing plants, oil, wine and syrup factories, indigenous fertilizer plants, small lime and potash plants, building materials factories, carpentry factories, and paper mills, so that the communes have the power of self-reliance and fundamentally solve the supply of means of production.
    Under the leadership of the Yian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the industrial department is responsible for the manufacture of rural machinery and equipment and the training of technical workers, and the commercial department is responsible for the purchase, sale, and transportation of raw materials and products. At the beginning, due to insufficient raw materials and equipment, some cadres had the phenomenon of "asking upwards with both hands and running outwards with both legs." Later, after mobilizing the masses to discuss and study and under the instructions of the higher-level party committee, the method of "digging, squeezing, importing, and manufacturing" was adopted, using the acquired broken copper, scrap iron, waste machinery, and substitutes to solve the difficulty of insufficient materials. Digging means digging up the inventory of the commercial department and digging up substitutes; squeezing means that all parties involved in the collaboration squeeze out potential material resources; importing means actively searching for sources of goods and actively organizing imports; manufacturing means actively processing and manufacturing according to the principle of local materials and local supply. Thanks to the close cooperation between the industrial and commercial departments, the eleven people's communes in the county established thirteen small power stations with a power generation capacity of 82,000 kilowatt-hours, eleven agricultural machinery repair plants with forty-three indigenous and foreign machine tools and some bench drills, small fire saws, baking ovens, taps, etc., seventeen joint processing plants with forty rice milling and flour milling machines and thirty-three feed crushing machines, and seventy-three peat fertilizer plants. In addition, sugar making, winemaking, oil making and other factories were generally established, thus beginning to change the original situation of the countryside being a single agricultural production.
    After these basic industries were established, they quickly played a role in agricultural production. At the end of last year, the people's communes repaired more than 6,000 tractors, internal combustion engines, generators, threshing machines, and other general agricultural tools and machinery themselves, and made more than 10,000 general small agricultural tools, which powerfully supported the autumn harvest, plowing, and water conservancy construction, and improved work efficiency. The mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing greatly saved labor. The labor and animal labor saved by rice milling and feed crushing alone in one year is equivalent to the amount of work required to plow and harrow the county's cultivated land twice. Before the Baoquan People's Commune in the county realized the mechanization of rice milling, an average of 400 manual workers and 600 animal workers were needed every day to push the millstones. Now, only twenty or so people are enough. After establishing oil, wine, sugar, and peat for the three treasures (fertilizer, crude oil, biogas) and other factories in the countryside, the agricultural and sideline products can be more reasonably and comprehensively utilized, and the waste that has been discarded over the years has been turned into wealth. The peasants saw the prospects of commune industrialization, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher.

    工商协作促进农业机械化
    依安人民公社建立基本工业
    本报讯　黑龙江省依安县采取“工商协作，武装农村”的办法，已为农村人民公社建立起一套基本工业，对实现公社工业化、农业工厂化创造了有利条件。
    1958年工农业生产大跃进、特别是实现农村人民公社化以后，迫切要求早日实现公社工业化和农业机械化、电气化，这就给工业生产和商业供应工作提出了新的问题，要求供应又多又新的各种生产资料。按照过去的办法，农村需要什么农具机械，商业部门就依靠采购进货，直接供应什么，这样使农村长久依赖城市，不能自力更生，这种从“梢”上供应的方法，不能保证今天农业生产不断跃进对农具机械提出新的要求。因此，这个县根据中共黑龙江省委“工商协作，武装农村”的指示，帮助人民公社建立基本工业，实行“两包、三化、十帮助”，即：包设备、包资材；支援实现绳索牵引化、轨道化、水利化；帮助公社建立动力站、机械修理厂、粮米加工厂、饲料粉碎厂、油酒糖稀厂、土化肥厂、小灰制三钾厂、建筑材料厂、木工厂、造纸厂等，使公社有自力更生的力量，根本解决生产资料的供应工作。
    在中共依安县委领导下，由工业部门负责农村机械设备的制造与训练技术工人，商业部门负责原料和产品的购、销、调运工作。在开始时，因原材料、设备不足，有些干部曾有“两手向上要，两腿向外跑”的现象，后来经过发动群众讨论研究和上级党委指示，才采取了
  “挖、挤、进、造”的方法，利用收购来的破铜烂铁，残废机械和代用品，解决了物资不足的困难。挖是挖商业部门的库存，挖代用品；挤是协作各方挤出潜在物资力量；进是多方寻找货源，积极组织进货；造是根据就地取材、就地供应的原则，积极进行加工制造。由于工业和商业部门密切协作，全县十一个人民公社建立起拥有八万二千度发电量的十三处小型发电站，有四十三台土洋机床和一部分台钻、小火锯、烘炉、丝锥等设备的十一处农具机械修造厂，有四十台制米磨面机和三十三台饲料粉碎机的十七处联合加工厂，有七十三个草炭化肥厂。此外还普遍建立了制糖、制酒、制油等工厂，从而开始改变了农村原来只是单一农业生产的局面。
    这些基本工业建立起来后，在农业生产上很快发挥了作用。在去年底，各人民公社就自己修理了拖拉机、内燃机、发电机、脱谷机和其他一般农具机械六千多件，自造一般小农具一万多件，有力地支援了秋收、翻地和水利建设，提高了工作效率。农副产品加工机械化，大大节省了劳动力，仅是制米、饲料粉碎一项，一年节省的人工和马工，就等于全县耕地铲趟两遍的工作量。这个县的宝泉人民公社在实现制米机械化前，每天平均需四百个人工和六百个马工推碾、拉磨，现在只用二十几个人就够了。在农村建立了油、酒、糖、草炭取三宝
  （肥料、原油、沼气）等工厂后，使农副产品更能得到合理的综合利用，把历年扔掉的废物都变成了财富。农民看到了公社工业化的远景，生产积极性更高了。
