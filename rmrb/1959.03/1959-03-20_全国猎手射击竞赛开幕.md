    Three hundred and thirty-one shooters from twenty-eight units across the country, including provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, were warmly welcomed by the audience as they marched in formation. Starting March 20th, they will compete here in individual and team events for skeet shooting and running deer shooting.
    Lu Houqing of the Heilongjiang team, who holds two national records in skeet shooting, and Tan Binggong, a Zhuang ethnic minority athlete from the People's Liberation Army who holds two national records in running deer shooting, will both participate in this competition. Among the shooters participating in this competition, there are veterans with more than twenty years of hunting experience, as well as sixteen-year-old youths. The Yunnan delegation also includes two twenty-one-year-old female shooters who will compete alongside male shooters.

Shooters participating in the skeet shooting competition will use double-barreled shotguns to shoot fifty disc-shaped objects made of asphalt and gypsum that are thrown into the air, and the one who hits the most will win the championship. Running deer shooting athletes will stand one hundred meters away and use military rifles to shoot fifty bullets at a target on a moving fake deer (divided into three shots of twenty, twenty, and ten bullets). The champion will be the contestant who hits the most rings.
