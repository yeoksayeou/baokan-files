Promoting and Improving the Development of Workers' On-the-Job Education
The First Tractor Factory and Jiangling Machinery Factory Have Made Remarkable Achievements in Running Schools in Factories and Workshops
　　
Our Newspaper (Reporter Zhang Jianhong) reported: The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant has achieved remarkable results in running on-the-job education by combining factory-run schools with workshop-run schools, combining uniformity with diversity, and combining popularization with improvement.
　　
The scale of the tractor factory's schooling is grand. The factory has night universities, senior high schools, junior high schools, and secondary technical schools uniformly run by the factory, systematically teaching regular courses; it also has schools run by workshops and offices based on the principle of "filling in what is lacking." In addition, there are five specialized research institutes. These schools are divided into 48 departments, 5 subjects, and 284 classes. In this way, a complete education system that combines education and productive labor is formed. A total of more than 15,000 employees participated in various types of on-the-job learning, accounting for more than 75% of all employees. In order to ensure the on-the-job learning of employees, the Propaganda Department of the factory party committee specially arranged teaching time on the premise of not delaying production and learning. Thus workers in the day, evening, and night shifts can all get two hours of learning in addition to their daily eight hours of work, and everyone can study for twelve hours a week. Workers in each workshop study in two shifts every day, each shift for two hours. The study time for cadres in offices is all from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm after the late shift. All employees are very satisfied with this arrangement of study time, which does not hinder production and does not occupy their rest time.
　　
Experience over the past year has proven that employees who participate in various studies have made significant progress, and everyone can apply what they have learned. The original lack of culture, lack of factory management knowledge, and lack of practical experience have undergone fundamental changes, and the level of business and technical theory has also been improved. In the technological revolution, they made inventions and innovations and made technical innovation proposals based on their acquired knowledge. Therefore, advanced production deeds have continued to occur, and new production records have continued to emerge. In October of last year, the students of the Metallurgical Science Institute creatively mastered the cutting-edge technology of installing circulating water jackets in cupola furnaces. The one-ton, three-ton, and twelve-ton alkaline water jacket cupola furnaces that they successfully modified replaced the alkaline cupola furnaces lined with magnesite, overcoming the difficulty of magnesite shortage. The students of this academy also recently successfully tested current "reversing electroplating" at the lowest cost. With this invention and creation, the production efficiency of all four electroplating divisions of the factory will be increased several times, and the process quality will also be improved accordingly. Liu Yao, a worker who is studying in high school, used to spend 40 minutes processing a tractor tie rod bushing. Now, because he has mastered the knowledge of "triangles" in his studies, he can accurately calculate the angle in advance, so it only takes four minutes to process each tie rod bushing. Among all the students, many people have already learned to raise their practical operating experience to the theoretical stage, or to guide their practical operations with scientific and technological principles.
　　
Our Newspaper (Reporter Li Sufen) reported: Chongqing Jiangling Machinery Factory adopted several methods to consolidate workshop schools, and all 18 workshop-run schools in the factory have persisted in learning.
　　
Since October last year, various workshops in the Jiangling Machinery Factory have started schools, and workers have signed up for enrollment. The number of people studying in the schools run by various workshops in the Jiangling Machinery Factory quickly reached more than 73% of the total number of students in various types of schools run by the factory. However, some workshop schools gradually decreased in the number of students after they were opened. The factory party committee conducted a detailed investigation and analysis. The main reason was that some employees did not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of running schools in workshops. At the same time, there were still some shortcomings in the specific work of running schools in some workshops, such as not being able to accurately assess the level of workers' education, and some people were assigned to classes inappropriately.
　　
In response to these situations, the factory party committee decided that workshop schools must be rectified and consolidated. To this end, the party committee specially established an education office, led by the deputy secretary of the party committee, and sent full-time teachers to various workshops. Some active, enthusiastic, and capable workers or cadres were also selected to take on teaching work. The workshop schools also re-assigned classes to each worker according to their level of education. The party committee also made unified provisions for the on-the-job study time of employees: at least two study sessions (two evenings) must be guaranteed every week.
　　
Secondly, the factory party committee continued to carry out propaganda on the party's education policy deeply and repeatedly among the employees, so that every group and every worker had a thorough understanding of the necessity of running schools in workshops. Now, when many workshops, work sections, and production teams arrange production tasks, they also arrange to complete study tasks; and guaranteeing double leaps forward is one of the conditions for evaluating workshops or work sections and groups. Many work section leaders and production team leaders took the lead in actively participating in school work and learning. In this way, the workers worked hard to create learning conditions and strive to participate in learning on time.
　　
In addition, two methods were also adopted to improve the teaching quality of workshop schools: one is to send some full-time teachers from the factory-run schools to the workshops. In addition to participating in regular labor, they also collected and understood the opinions and requirements of workers, and helped the teachers of the workshop schools to establish teaching and research groups and establish a regular lesson preparation and collective discussion system. The second is that the factory-run schools strengthened business guidance to the workshop-run schools, frequently provided short-term training for the teachers of the workshop schools; and helped the workshop-run schools to reform teaching content and compile textbooks that are closely integrated with reality.
　　
After the schools run by the workshops were gradually consolidated, many activists who were good at both production and learning emerged in the Jiangling Machinery Factory. Li Shijin, an old worker in the woodworking workshop, persisted in learning and quickly reached the level of graduation from senior elementary school from knowing a few words. He had been thinking about a tenoning machine for three years without success. Because he learned the methods of calculating the size of pulleys, speed, and infeed, he quickly made it.

    普及和提高结合发展职工业余教育
    第一拖拉机厂和江陵机器厂工厂与车间办学取得显著成就
    本报讯　记者张健虹报道：第一拖拉机制造厂根据工厂统一办学与车间办学结合，统一性与多样性相结合，普及与提高相结合的精神大办业余教育，并取得了显著成就。
    拖拉机厂办学的规模是宏大的。全厂有工厂统一开办的夜大学、高中、初中和中等技术学校，系统地讲授正规课程；也有按“缺啥补啥”的原则，以车间和处室为单位开办的学校，另外，还有五个专业研究院、所。这些学校共分四十八系、五科、二百八十四班。这样，就形成了一个教育与生产劳动相结合的完整教育体系。全厂共有一万五千多人参加了各类业余学习，占全体职工的75％以上。为了保证职工们的业余学习，厂党委宣传部门特在生产学习两不误的前提下，统一安排了授课时间，使日夜三班工人，都能在每日八小时工作之外，得到二小时的学习，每周每人都能学习十二小时。各个车间工人，每日分两个班次进行学习，每一班次为二小时，科处室干部的学习时间，全部在下晚班后的下午七时到九时。全体职工对这样既不妨碍生产又不侵占他们休息的学习时间安排，感到十分满意。
    一年来的经验证明，参与各项学习的职工，都有着显著的进步，人人能够学以致用。原来缺少文化、缺乏工厂管理知识和实际操作经验的现象，都起了根本的变化，业务技术理论水平也提高了。他们在技术革命中，依据自己学得的知识，大搞发明创造，大提技术革新建议，因而先进的生产事迹不断发生，新的生产纪录不断涌现。冶金科学院的学员们，在去年10月，创造性地掌握了在冲天炉内安装循环水套的尖端技术，他们改装成功的一吨、三吨到十二吨的碱性水套冲天炉，代替了用镁砂搪的碱性冲天炉，克服了镁砂缺乏的困难。这个科学院的学员们，最近还以最低的成本试验电流“换向电镀”成功。有了这个发明创造，全厂四个电镀工部的生产效率都将提高数倍，工艺质量也将随着提高。正在高中学习的工人刘耀，过去制造拖拉机拉杆衬套时，需四十分钟加工一个，现在由于他在学习中掌握了“三角”知识，能事先精确地计算出角度，因而每加工一个拉杆衬套，便只要四分钟就够了。在全体学员中，已经有不少的人懂得将自己的实际操作经验上升到理论阶段，或是用科学技术原理来指导自己的实际操作。
    本报讯　记者黎素芬报道：重庆江陵机器厂采用几种办法巩固车间学校，全厂十八所车间办的学校，校校都坚持了学习。
    去年10月起，江陵机器厂各车间都办起了学校，工人们纷纷报名入学。在江陵机器厂各车间办的学校学习的人数，很快就达到了全厂办的各类学校学员总人数73％以上。但是，有的车间学校在开办以后不久，学习人数渐渐地少起来。工厂党委作了详细的调查和分析，主要是因为职工中还有一部分人对车间办学的必要性认识不足。同时有的车间在办学的具体工作上还存在一些缺点，如对工人文化程度高低摸得不透，有些人编班不合适等。
    针对这些情况，工厂党委决定必须将车间学校加以整顿和巩固。为此党委专门成立了教育办公室，由党委副书记领导，并向各车间派出专职教员，还选了一些积极热情、能力较强的工人或干部来担任教学工作。车间学校又根据每个工人的文化程度给他们重新编了班。党委还将职工们的业余学习时间作了统一的规定：每周至少要保证学习两次（分两个晚上学）。
    其次，工厂党委还在职工中间继续深入地反复地开展了党的教育方针的宣传，使每个小组、每个工人都透彻认识车间办学的必要性。现在，许多车间、工段、生产小组布置生产任务的时候，都要布置完成学习任务；并以保证双跃进作为车间或工段、小组评比的条件之一。许多工段长、生产小组长带头积极参加办学工作和学习。这样，工人们都努力创造学习条件，争取按时参加学习。
    另外，还采取了两种办法来提高车间教学质量：一是把厂办学校的一部分专职教师下放到车间，除参加定期的劳动外，还收集和了解工人的意见和要求，帮助车间学校的教师成立教研组，建立与健全定期备课和集体研究讨论制度。二是厂办学校加强对车间办的学校的业务指导，经常短期地轮训车间学校的教师；并且帮助车间办的学校改革教学内容，编写结合实际密切的教材。
    车间办的学校逐步巩固起来后，江陵机器厂出现了许多生产好学习也好的积极分子。木工车间的老工人李世金坚持学习，很快就由识几个字达到高小毕业程度。他想了三年而没有成功的企口机，因为学会了计算皮带轮大小、转速、进刀等的方法，很快就做成了。
