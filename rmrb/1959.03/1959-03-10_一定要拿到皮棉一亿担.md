Editorial: We Must Obtain 100 Million Dan of Ginned Cotton

The Waking of Insects has passed, and in about a month, the cotton planting season will arrive. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward a grand target for national cotton production in 1959: approximately 100 million dan of ginned cotton. This is an even greater leap forward target, an increase of approximately 33 million dan over 1958, and triple the amount of 1957. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of peasants and agricultural workers on state farms in cotton-producing areas achieved a great victory in doubling cotton production. This year, they must muster even greater efforts than last year, take even better measures than last year, and strive to complete and overfulfill this great task put forward by the Party Central Committee.

To achieve the goal of producing 100 million dan of ginned cotton, the cotton planting area this year must be expanded to 100 million mu, that is, more than 15 million mu of new cotton fields must be added compared to last year. Last year, cotton fields with a yield of over 100 jin per mu accounted for only two-fifths of the total cotton field area. This year, all cotton fields must have an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu to reach a total output of 100 million dan. This is an arduous task. Moreover, we must also consider the limitations of natural conditions in various places, the unevenness of work development, possible disaster losses in some areas, and the relatively poor conditions of new cotton areas. Therefore, in the 100 million mu of cotton fields, a considerable area must achieve yields of 150 jin, 200 jin, or even more than 300 jin per mu to complete and over fulfill this year's cotton production task.

Old cotton areas are the main force in the battle to seize 100 million dan of ginned cotton. Old cotton areas have a stronger force leading cotton production, have relatively rich cotton planting techniques and experience in fighting disasters, have better material conditions, and have higher and more stable yields. They have more favorable conditions for increasing yield per unit area. The task of producing 100 million dan of ginned cotton this year will be mainly undertaken by old cotton areas. To ensure the realization of the state plan, the cotton field area in old cotton areas must not be reduced, and the cotton field area of last year must be maintained or slightly increased. The unit area yield of cotton must be increased by more than 70% on the basis of 1958, which is equivalent to three and a half times the unit area yield of 1957. Some people believe that there is insufficient labor in old cotton areas, and cotton fields should be reduced. Others believe that with the expansion of cotton fields across the country, increasing production will not be a major problem. These ideas are incorrect. Is it possible for old cotton areas to increase their unit area yield by 70% this year? Based on the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, it is entirely possible to greatly increase the unit area yield. Last year, the number of counties (cities) with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu increased from five in 1957 to more than one hundred. At the same time, many counties and communes with yields of 200 jin or even more than 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu emerged. These high-yield counties and communes not only appeared in concentrated high-yield cotton areas, but also in so-called "low-yield areas," mountainous and hilly areas, and remote and scattered cotton areas. In these places, natural conditions are not very favorable. Large-scale and substantial increases in production are mainly due to the development of people's subjective initiative, further mastery of the growth patterns of cotton, and conscientious implementation of the eight basic measures for agricultural production increase. These experiences and examples of leap forward production increases are the basis and model for old cotton areas to rapidly increase unit area yields this year.

New cotton areas are the fresh troops in the battle to complete 100 million dan of ginned cotton. In these areas, not only must the task of expanding new cotton fields by 15 million mu be completed, but also the unit area yield is generally required to be higher than the national average yield in 1958. This requires great efforts to achieve for new cotton areas with relatively poor technical conditions. Quickly arranging the planting plan to each commune and each production team, mobilizing the masses to discuss the necessity, possibility, and practicality of completing the state plan, and implementing the planting plan for expanding new cotton fields to ensure timely sowing according to the state plan are the most urgent tasks for new cotton areas at present. It must be understood that only with a certain planting area can the completion of the total output be reliably guaranteed. The idea of reducing new cotton fields is completely wrong. Completing the task of expanding new cotton fields not only plays a significant role in the nation's efforts to seize 100 million dan of ginned cotton, but also has important significance for local cotton self-sufficiency and the commune's increased commodity production and increased income. In terms of ideological mobilization, material supply, and technical instruction, proper arrangements should be made to expand new cotton planting areas. Currently, many new cotton areas have begun cotton planting technology training; some areas are paying attention to solving some ideological problems of the masses while conducting technical training. Provinces with more tasks for expanding new cotton areas this year all had counties with yields of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu or even double 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1958. As long as we earnestly promote the large-scale high-yield cotton experience of these counties, the leap forward in production in new cotton areas is also promising. The "sending out to learn, inviting in to teach" method, which has been effective in promoting cotton planting technology in various places in recent years, should be widely promoted in new cotton areas.

This year's cotton production increase has more favorable conditions than last year. Cadres and the masses in cotton-producing areas have been tempered and encouraged by last year's Great Leap Forward in cotton production, have higher enthusiasm for labor and revolutionary drive, and have also increased practical experience and scientific analysis capabilities. This year's cotton fields have made great progress in deep plowing, fertilizer, water conservancy, and seeds compared to last year. According to statistics from several provinces, nearly 70% of winter-plowed cotton fields have been deep-plowed, of which 30% have been deep-plowed to more than one chi, and 15% have been deep-plowed to more than one chi and five cun, with a depth much greater than last year. Some cotton fields have been applied with base fertilizer in combination with winter plowing. Due to the recent development of the movement to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields will be greater than last year; the chemical fertilizer supplied by the state is mainly used for cotton fields. The irrigated area benefiting cotton fields before sowing will be about twice as large as last year; coupled with drainage facilities, cotton fields that are guaranteed against drought and flood can reach 70% to 80% of the national cotton field area. It is estimated that the country can continue to expand the "Daizi cotton" improved varieties by more than 20 million mu this year, and cotton fields planted with this improved variety will reach about 75% of the total national cotton field area. These measures will certainly play a good role in the further leap forward in cotton production this year. The large-scale high-yield cotton fields and high-yield cotton fields that appeared in various cotton-producing areas last year provided rich experience for creating more and higher large-scale high-yield cotton fields this year. Many new cotton planting technologies created and developed last year will continue to improve in this year's new practice. Promoting the experience of some "points" to a larger "area" can greatly increase the total output. These "points" that have created high yields are skilled and striving for perfection, further mastering the growth patterns of cotton, and further adding measures, and can also further improve the unit yield. The national rural people's commune is a decisive favorable condition for the continued leap forward in cotton production. Cotton planting requires a lot of investment and labor, and technical requirements are relatively high; the establishment of people's communes makes it easier to implement various cotton production increase measures in a timely manner. By making good use of these favorable conditions and giving full play to their role, we can complete this year's great task of cotton production.

Although there are many favorable conditions for this year's leap forward in cotton production, the development of things is always unbalanced; everything always has two sides. We must see the advanced, but also see the relatively backward; we must see the favorable side, but also see the unfavorable side. Unfavorable factors are generated in the process of great development. It is wrong to regard them as too serious, which would not conform to the facts and would be detrimental to the development of enthusiasm. However, completely ignoring them, treating them as if they do not exist, is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also unfavorable to the full development of enthusiasm. It should be noted that in the preparatory work for cotton areas, there are still many important tasks to be done. One-third of the country's cotton fields—even one-half of the cotton fields in some areas—have not been winter-plowed and are waiting for spring plowing. Many winter-plowed cotton fields have not been harrowed, and the phenomenon of moisture loss is very serious. Measures to preserve moisture must be taken quickly. To meet the requirements of deep plowing and close planting, most cotton fields must apply more base fertilizer before sowing; many cotton fields need spring irrigation; cotton seeds must also be distributed to commune members in a timely manner for seed selection. It is quite busy to do so many things in a month or so, plus the many tasks other than sowing cotton. The current urgent task in cotton production is to do a good job in preparing for planting, ensuring timely sowing, improving sowing quality, and ensuring that one mu is planted and one mu is guaranteed, laying a good foundation for the leap forward in production. We must do everything possible and think of every way to do these many things in a timely manner. Losing one day of opportunity is equivalent to losing who knows how many jin of cotton. Each people's commune and each production team must seize the time, concentrate labor, fertilizer, and water in accordance with the planting plan, ensure the timely completion of spring plowing, spring irrigation, spring application of base fertilizer, harrowing to preserve moisture, etc. of cotton fields, sow in a timely manner, and ensure full seedlings.

Carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement in cotton fields is an important guarantee for realizing the continued leap forward in cotton production this year. Each cotton-producing area must create more high-yield counties, communes, and teams with a yield of 200 jin or 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Last year, there were more than 100 counties with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and more than 10 counties with a yield of 200 jin and 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The emergence of these large-scale high-yield typical examples revealed the secret of cotton production increase potential and provided rich experience for creating more and higher large-scale high-yield cotton fields this year. If we strive to reach about 40% of the total national cotton field area with cotton fields with a yield of more than 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, we can produce more than 80 million dan of ginned cotton, that is, we can complete 80% of the production task; it will be easier for the remaining 20% of the task to be completed by 60% of the cotton fields.

It is not too difficult to produce 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. We can calculate it this way: 200 jin of ginned cotton is equivalent to 550 jin to 600 jin of seed cotton; calculated at an average of 100 bolls per jin of seed cotton, about 60,000 bolls must be produced per mu; calculated at 4,000 to 5,000 plants per mu, an average of 12 to 15 bolls per plant can obtain a yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu; about 20 bolls per plant can obtain a yield of 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Of course, while carrying out the large-scale high-yield cotton field movement, we cannot relax management of ordinary cotton fields; we must use high-yield cotton fields to drive the general increase in production of ordinary cotton fields and achieve a comprehensive leap forward in cotton production. We must add measures in accordance with the goal of being much larger than the production of 100 million dan of ginned cotton in the spirit of "10-point target, 12-point measures, 24-point effort," so that we will be more confident in completing and over fulfilling the task of producing 100 million dan of ginned cotton.

The cotton production increase measures proposed by various places this year are more detailed and practical than in previous years. For example, Hebei Province proposed that cotton should have "three increases" (i.e., increase fruit branches, increase cotton bolls, increase boll weight), "three preventions" (i.e., prevent disease, prevent insects, prevent bud and boll abscission), and "one promotion" (i.e., promote high yield and early maturity). Hubei Province also proposed ten measures for cotton to achieve high yields. Under the requirements of a leap forward in production and increased measures, the labor required for cotton fields will inevitably increase accordingly. Cotton crops require a lot of labor, and labor shortage is a major problem in concentrated cotton areas. Therefore, reforming tools and increasing labor productivity have become more urgent issues in ensuring the leap forward in cotton production. In addition to general deep plowing and harrowing tools, cotton sowing, cultivation, pest control, and flower harvesting tools must also be improved. This can not only improve labor efficiency and save labor, but also improve work quality. Shaanxi Province plans to promote 91,400 animal-powered double-row strip sowing machines and 500 power four-row sowing machines this year, as well as 280,700 animal-powered cultivators; coupled with the sowing machines and cultivators promoted in the past few years, the cotton sowing and cultivation work this year can achieve semi-mechanization. This is a good start to realizing the semi-mechanization of all work in cotton fields. Each concentrated cotton area must use greater efforts to solve this problem.

Having the secretary take the lead and be responsible full-time has a decisive role in striving for a greater leap forward in cotton production. Last year, in the major cotton-producing areas, from the county to the commune to the team, the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels took the lead, and the production team leaders were fixed to be responsible for a certain farming area, forming a line of leadership and a professional team for cotton production, which played a huge role in the leap forward in cotton production. This year, Hubei Province has proposed that the special zone, county, and township should still be responsible for cotton production by one secretary; the secretary who managed cotton last year and has not been transferred will continue to be responsible for this special responsibility. Shandong Province proposed that a county with 400,000 mu of cotton fields should be responsible for cotton production by one secretary, one county head, and several county party committee members; a county with 200,000 mu of cotton fields should be responsible for cotton production by one secretary and several county party committee members; and a county with 100,000 mu of cotton fields should be responsible for cotton production by one county head and one county party committee member. This is a method worth promoting. In addition to the division of labor and responsibility of leading cadres, professional production teams should also be established in cotton field management, so that each piece of cotton field from planting to harvesting has a dedicated person responsible, which is more conducive to strengthening cotton field management and striving for high yields per mu and rich harvests in each block.

This year's cotton production task is arduous, but as long as we muster greater efforts and strive for more effective measures, 100 million dan of ginned cotton can definitely be obtained.

### 一定要拿到皮棉一亿担

    一定要拿到皮棉一亿担
    惊蛰已过，还有一个月左右的时间，棉花播种的季节就要到来了。党的八届六中全会已经提出了1959年全国的棉花生产宏伟任务：皮棉一亿担左右。这是一个更大的跃进的指标，它比1958年增长大约三千三百万担，等于1957年的三倍。全国产棉区广大农民群众和国营农场的农业工人，去年在党的领导下取得了棉花产量翻一番的伟大胜利；今年要鼓足比去年更大的干劲，采取比去年更好的措施，为完成和超额完成党中央提出的这个伟大的任务而斗争。
    为了达到生产皮棉一亿担的目标，今年的棉花种植面积必须扩大到一亿亩，即比去年扩大新棉田一千五百多万亩。去年，亩产百斤以上的棉田，才占棉田总面积的五分之二；今年，要全部棉田平均亩产百斤皮棉，总产量才能达到一亿担。这是一个繁重的任务。而且，还必须考虑到各地自然条件的限制、工作发展的不平衡、局部地区可能发生的灾害损失以及新棉区的条件较差等等因素。因此，在一亿亩棉田中，要有相当大的面积的棉田达到亩产一百五十斤、二百斤以至三百斤以上，才能完成和超额完成今年的棉花生产任务。
    老棉区是夺取一亿担皮棉的战斗中的主力。老棉区领导棉花生产的力量较强，有比较丰富的植棉技术和向灾害作斗争的经验，物质条件比较好，产量较高而也比较稳定，在提高单位面积产量方面具备比较多的有利条件。今年生产皮棉一亿担的任务，绝大部分要由老棉区来担负。为了保证国家计划的实现，老棉区的棉田面积不能减少，要维持去年的棉田面积或稍有增加；棉花的单位面积产量必须在1958年的基础上再增加70％以上，也就是说相当于1957年单位面积产量的三倍半。有人认为，老棉区劳力不足，要缩减棉田；也有人认为，全国棉田扩大了，增产问题不大。这些想法都是不正确的。老棉区今年提高单位面积产量70％，这是不是可能做到呢？根据去年大跃进的经验，大大提高单位面积产量是完全可能的。去年亩产百斤皮棉县，由1957年的五个县（市）增加到了一百几十个；同时，还出现了许多亩产皮棉二百斤以至三百斤以上的县、社。这些丰产县和丰产社不仅出现在集中高产棉区，而且也出现在过去所谓“低产区”、山地丘陵区和边远分散棉区。在这些地方，自然条件并不十分优越。大面积大幅度增产，主要是由于发挥了人们的主观能动性，进一步掌握了棉花的生长规律，认真地执行了农业增产八项基本措施的结果。这些跃进增产的经验和实例，就是老棉区今年迅速提高单位面积产量的根据和榜样。
    新棉区是完成一亿担皮棉的战斗中的生力军，在这些地区，不仅要完成扩大新棉田一千五百万亩的任务，而且单位面积产量一般也要求高于1958年的全国平均产量。这对技术条件较差的新棉区来说，是要经过很大努力才能实现的。迅速把种植计划布置到各公社、各生产队，发动群众讨论完成国家计划的必要性、可能性和现实性，使扩大新棉田的种植计划落实，保证按照国家计划及时播种，这是新棉区目前最迫切的任务。必须了解，只有有了一定的种植面积，总产量的完成才有可靠的保证。减少新棉田的想法是完全不对的。完成扩大新棉田的任务，不仅对全国夺取一亿担皮棉有重大作用，同时对当地用棉自给和公社增产商品、增加收入也有重要意义。为了扩大新的植棉地区，在思想动员、物资供应、技术传授等方面，都要进行妥善安排。目前不少新棉区已经开始了植棉技术训练；有些地区在技术训练的同时，注意解决群众的一些思想问题。今年扩大新棉区任务较多的省份，在1958年都曾出现了亩产百斤皮棉县以至双百斤皮棉县；只要认真推广这些县的大面积棉花丰产经验，新棉区的产量跃进也是大有可为。几年来在各地推广植棉技术方面行之有效的“派出去学，请进来教”的方法，在新棉区应当广泛推行。
    今年棉花增产有着比去年更多的有利条件。产棉区干部和群众经过去年棉花生产大跃进的锻炼和鼓舞，有了更高的劳动热情和革命干劲，也增加了实际经验和科学分析能力。今年棉田在深耕、肥料、水利、种子等方面，都比去年有很大的进步。根据几个省的统计，冬耕棉田近70％，其中深翻一尺以上的占30％，深耕一尺五寸以上的占15％，深度比去年增加了很多。部分棉田结合冬耕施了底肥。由于最近开展了积肥造肥运动，棉田施肥量将比去年增多；国家供应的化学肥料主要是用于棉田。棉田播种前的灌溉受益面积将比去年增加两倍左右；加上排涝设施，旱涝保收的棉田可达到全国棉田面积的70％到80％。预计今年全国可继续扩大“岱子棉”良种二千多万亩，种植这种良种的棉田将达到全国棉田总面积的75％左右。这些措施，对今年棉花的产量的再跃进，一定会起良好作用。去年各产棉区出现的大面积丰产棉田和高额丰产棉田，为今年创造更多更高的大面积棉花丰产提供了丰富经验；去年创造和发展的许多新的植棉技术，在今年新的实践中将不断提高。把一些“点”的经验推广到更大的“面”，就可以大大提高总产量。这些创造了高额产量的“点”熟能生巧，精益求精，更进一步掌握棉花的生长规律，更进一步添加措施，也还能更进一步提高单位产量。全国农村人民公社化，对棉花继续跃进增产更是个决定性的有利条件。种植棉花需要的投资多、劳力多，技术要求较高；人民公社的成立，更便于及时贯彻实行各项棉花增产措施。好好运用这些有利条件，充分发挥它们的作用，就能够完成今年棉花生产的伟大任务。
    今年棉花跃进增产虽然有很多有利条件，但是，事物的发展总是不平衡的；任何事物总是有两面的。要看到先进的，也要看到比较落后的；要看到有利的一面，也要看到不利的一面。不利的因素是大发展过程中产生的，把它们看得过分严重是不对的，那样就不符合事实，就会不利于积极性的发挥。可是，完全忽视它们，把它们看作好像并不存在，那既不符合事实，也会不利于积极性的充分发挥。应该看到，在棉区的备耕工作中，目前还有不少重要的工作要做。全国还有三分之一的棉田——有些地区甚至有二分之一的棉田没有冬耕，正待春翻；不少冬耕的棉田没有耙平，跑墒的现象很严重，要赶快采取保墒措施。适应深耕密植的要求，绝大部分棉田要在播种前施更多底肥；很多棉田需要春灌；棉花种子也必须及时发到社员手里，以便粒选。一个来月的时间要做好这许多事情，再加上播种棉花以外的许多工作，是相当繁忙的。当前棉花生产方面的迫切任务，是做好备耕工作，保证及时播种，提高播种质量，作到种一亩保一亩，为产量跃进打好基础。必须尽一切力量、想一切办法，把这许多事及时做好。失去一天时机，等于失去不知多少斤棉花。各个人民公社和每个生产队一定要抓紧时间，按照种植计划，集中劳力、肥料和水，保证及时完成棉田的春翻、春灌、春施底肥、耙耱保墒等工作，及时播种，保证全苗。
    开展棉田大面积高额丰产运动，是实现今年棉花生产继续跃进的一个重要保证。各个产棉区要创造更多亩产皮棉二百斤、三百斤的丰产县、社、队。去年亩产百斤皮棉县有一百几十个，亩产二百斤和三百斤皮棉县有十多个；这些大面积丰产典型的出现，揭开了棉花增产潜力的秘密，为今年创造更多更高的大面积棉花丰产提供了丰富的经验。如果争取到亩产皮棉二百斤以上的棉田达到全国棉田总面积的40％左右，就可以生产皮棉八千多万担，也就是说可以完成80％的生产任务；其余20％的任务由60％的棉田来完成，就比较容易了。　　　
    亩产二百斤皮棉并不是太困难的事。可以这样算一个账：二百斤皮棉折合五百五十斤到六百斤籽棉；按平均一百铃一斤籽棉计算，每亩要结铃六万个左右；以每亩四千株至五千株计算，平均每株结铃十二个至十五个，就可以获得每亩二百斤皮棉的产量；每株结铃二十个左右，就可以获得每亩三百斤皮棉的产量。当然，在开展棉田大面积高额丰产运动的同时，对一般棉田也不能放松管理；必须运用高额丰产棉田带动一般棉田普遍增产，实现棉花生产全面跃进。我们必须根据“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的精神，按照比生产一亿担皮棉大得多的目标来添加措施，只有这样完成和超额完成一亿担皮棉的生产任务才更有把握。
    今年各地提出的棉花增产措施，都比往年细致、切实。例如，河北省提出了棉花要“三增”（即增果枝、增棉铃、增铃重）、“三防”（即防病、防虫、防蕾铃脱落）、“一促进”（即促进丰产早熟）。湖北省也提出了棉花丰产要掌握的十项措施。在产量跃进、措施加码的要求下，棉田需用的劳动力也必然要相应增加。棉花作物需工较多，在集中棉区，劳动力不足更是一个较大的问题。因此，改革工具，提高劳动生产率，在保证棉花跃进增产上已成为更加迫切的课题。除一般深耕耙?工具外，还要改进棉花播种、中耕、治虫、收花等工具。这不仅可以提高劳动效率节省劳动力，而且能提高工作质量。陕西省今年计划推广畜力双行条播机九万一千四百台，动力四行播种机五百台，畜力中耕器二十八万零七百台；加上过去几年推广的播种机和中耕器，今年的棉花播种和中耕工作就可以实现半机械化。这是实现棉田全部工作半机械化的良好的开端。各个集中棉区都要用更大力量解决这个问题。
    书记挂帅、专职负责，对争取棉花生产更大跃进有决定性的作用。去年在各主要产棉区，从县到社、到队，都是由各级党委书记挂帅，由生产队长固定负责一定的耕作区域，形成了一条线的领导，形成了棉花生产的专业队伍，这对棉花跃进增产起了巨大作用。今年湖北省已经提出：专区、县、乡仍由一个书记负责棉花生产；去年管棉花的书记没有调动工作的，仍然继续负这个专责。山东省提出：有四十万亩棉田的县，由一个书记、一个县长、几个县委委员负责棉花生产；有二十万亩棉田的县，由一个书记和几个县委委员负责棉花生产；有十万亩棉田的县，由一个县长和一个县委委员负责棉花生产。这是值得提倡的办法。除领导干部分工负责以外，在棉田管理上还应成立专业生产队，做到每一块每一亩棉田从种到收都有专人负责，这样更有利于加强棉田管理，争取亩亩高产，块块丰收。
    今年棉花生产的任务是繁重的，但是，只要我们鼓足更大的干劲，争取更有力的措施，一亿担皮棉是一定能够拿到手的。
