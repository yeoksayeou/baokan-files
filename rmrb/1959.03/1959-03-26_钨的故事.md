The Story of Tungsten
　　　　Yì Shēng

    In ancient China, people paid great attention to the use of steel knives, but in the past, only a few craftsmen knew the secret of making high-quality steel knives, and their skills were never passed on to outsiders, only to their own children and grandchildren. After countless years, the secret of making good steel knives was discovered. One of the secrets is that steel knives contain the rare metal tungsten.

    In 1781, when someone was studying a mineral called "white tungsten," they discovered a new element. At the time, it was mistakenly believed to be a tin mineral. It was only when the mineral was decomposed with acids that it was determined to be the element tungsten.

    It took a hundred years after tungsten was discovered for it to be widely used in industry.

    In the 1850s, it was discovered that tungsten had a good effect on the properties of steel, but the widespread production of tungsten steel was a matter of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1900, newly invented high-speed steel was exhibited for the first time at the World Expo. After that, the tungsten mining industry developed rapidly.

    Tungsten is a unique metal, it is relatively hard and also the most difficult metal to melt.

    In 1865, Russia first smelted tungsten steel at the Motovilikha factory in Perm, and found that the drill bits made of tungsten steel were of excellent quality. From then on, metallurgists worked hard to study the use of tungsten steel to make tools, and later created excellent high-speed tungsten lathe tools.

    The appearance of tungsten lathe tools has increased metal cutting speed by 200 times in less than fifty years, from 10 meters per minute to more than 2,000 meters per minute. This can be said to be a revolution in the machinery manufacturing industry.

    However, high-speed tungsten lathe tools are no longer the sharpest. Hard alloys mainly composed of tungsten carbide are as hard as diamonds. Using hard alloys to make lathe tools has created new records for cutting speeds.

    Currently, 90% of tungsten production is used for steelmaking. All high-speed steel and almost all extremely hard steel are made with tungsten. Secondly, it is used in the manufacture of alloys and in the electrical industry. In addition, various industrial and technical departments also use some tungsten compounds.

    The melting point of tungsten is 3,400℃. At this temperature, almost all metals have become steam, and very few metals can remain in a liquid state. The temperature required to melt tungsten is equal to half the temperature of the sun's surface.

    Tungsten not only has high strength, but also has rare plasticity: a one-kilogram ingot of tungsten can be drawn into a thin wire 400 kilometers long. The tungsten filament in light bulbs is the most familiar to people. Our country has always been known for its tungsten production. With the development of our socialist construction, the tungsten mining industry will surely have a new leap forward.

    钨的故事
    义生
    我国古代就很讲究使用钢刀，但是过去只有少数工匠知道制造优质钢刀的秘密，而且他们的手艺绝不外传，仅仅传授给自己的儿孙。经过了无数的岁月，这种制造好钢刀的秘密才被发现。其中秘密之一，就是钢刀内含有稀有金属钨。
    1781年有人在研究一种名叫“白钨”的矿物时，发现一种新元素，当时还误认为是一种锡矿物，后用酸类分解这种矿物时，才确定是一种钨元素。
    钨在被发现一百年之后，才获得工业上的广泛应用。
    十九世纪五十年代里，发现了钨对钢的性质有良好影响，但钨钢的广泛生产却是十九世纪末和二十世纪初的事情。1900年第一次在世界博览会上展出新发明的高速钢。以后，采钨工业才得到急剧的发展。
    钨是一种奇特的金属，它是比较坚硬，同时又是最难熔的金属。
    1865年俄国在皮尔米的莫托维利赫工厂头一次炼出钨钢来，发现用钨钢制成的钻炮孔刀具质量极佳。从此冶金学家们便努力研究用钨钢来做工具，后来创造出了极好的高速钨车刀。
    由于钨车刀出现，在不到五十年的时间内，就使金属切削速度增加了二百倍，每分钟从十公尺增加至二千公尺以上，可以说是机器制造业中的一次革命。
    但高速钨车刀现在已不算最锋利的了。以碳化钨为主要成分的硬质合金，像金刚石一样的坚硬，用硬质合金做成车刀，又使得切削速度创造了更新的纪录。
    现在钨产量的90％都用于制钢。一切高速钢和几乎全部的极硬钢都是用钨制造的。其次用于制造合金及电气工业。另外，各个工业技术部门还应用钨的一些化合物。
    钨的熔点为3，400℃。在这种温度下几乎绝大部分金属都已成为蒸汽，很少金属还能保持液体状态。使钨熔化所需要温度，等于太阳表面温度的一半。
    钨不仅有很高的强度，还具有罕见的可塑性：重一公斤的钨锭可以抽成四百公里长的细丝。电灯泡内的钨丝，是人们最熟习的。我国自来都以产钨著称，随着我国社会主义建设的发展，采钨工业必将有一个新的跃进。
