Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th:  Nikola Shawi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party, said in his speech at the morning session of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on the 18th that the main target of the current anti-communist and anti-people movement in the Middle East is the young Republic of Iraq. The military rebellion that occurred in Iraq not long ago has been crushed by the Iraqi people. This shows that the anti-communist movement and the anti-people movement are doomed to failure.

Nikola Shawi said that the anti-communist movement in Egypt and Syria has been going on for almost three months. Thousands of communists, trade union activists, non-party patriotic people, and all progressive people have been persecuted and arrested. No one knows their current situation.

Nikola Shawi said that this anti-communist activity has strained the relationship between two fraternal Arab countries—the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq. This anti-communist movement makes it easier for imperialists to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries. This anti-communist movement and the white terror in Syria have brought misfortune not only to Syria, but also to Lebanon.

Nikola Shawi concluded by saying that in the struggle against imperialism, the communist parties of Arab countries have always stood at the forefront. The slander that communists are agents of imperialism cannot deceive the people.

    黎巴嫩共产党书记沙维强调
    反伊反共运动必遭失败
    新华社华沙18日电　黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会书记尼古拉·沙维在波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会18日上午会议上致词时说，目前在中东的反共反人民运动最主要的矛头是反对年青的伊拉克共和国。不久前在伊拉克所发生的军事叛乱已经被伊拉克人民粉碎了。这说明反共运动和反人民运动是注定要遭到失败的。
    尼古拉·沙维说，在埃及和叙利亚的反共运动已经进行差不多三个多月了。成千上万的共产党人、工会活动家、无党派爱国人士和一切进步人士都受到迫害和遭到逮捕。谁也不知道他们现在的情况。
    尼古拉·沙维说，这一反共活动使两个兄弟的阿拉伯国家——阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克共和国之间的关系紧张了。这一反共运动使帝国主义者便于干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。这一反共运动和叙利亚的白色恐怖不仅给叙利亚，而且也给黎巴嫩带来不幸。
    尼古拉·沙维最后说，在同帝国主义斗争中，阿拉伯各国共产党始终站在最前列，那些说共产党是帝国主义代理人的谰言是骗不了人民的。
