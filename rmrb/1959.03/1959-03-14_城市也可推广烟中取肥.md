    Cities Can Also Promote Fertilizer Extraction from Smoke
    In cities, the amount of coal smoke released from chimneys every day is enormous. If this coal smoke can be rationally utilized, it can not only freshen the city air and benefit hygiene, but also open up a new avenue for cities to support rural areas. Public canteens and factories in cities, those with chimney facilities, can all contribute to fertilizer accumulation. It would be best if fertilizer extraction equipment could be installed on chimneys in urban architectural designs in the future.
    There are many ways to extract fertilizer from smoke. The absorption device on the chimney of the Wanxian People's Committee Canteen is better, with a simple method and easy production. This method involves placing a bucket outside the middle of the chimney and using a bamboo tube to connect to the inside of the chimney, with one end connected to the bucket and the other end fitted with a nozzle. If there is tap water, a tap water nozzle can be installed. The nozzle is made of galvanized iron and its diameter is half the diameter of the chimney. When installed, the nozzle faces upwards so that the water sprayed is more uniform.
    When coal is burned, smoke constantly goes into the chimney. When it encounters the sprayed water, a chemical reaction occurs (the smoke contains sulfur dioxide, ammonium), and it turns into a mixture of coal smoke and water that flows out. Afterwards, the residue filtered with activated carbon, after being heated to a higher temperature and cooled, becomes ammonium sulfate (yellow and granular when not degummed).

    城市也可推广烟中取肥
    在城市里，每天从烟囱里散发出去的煤烟不知有多少。如果把这些煤烟加以合理利用，不仅能使城市空气新鲜，有益卫生，并为城市支援农村开辟了一条新的道路。城市的公共食堂和工厂等，凡有烟囱设备的，都可为积肥贡献出一分力量，最好以后在城市建筑设计上，就可在烟囱上安装取肥设备。
    烟中取肥的办法很多，万县人民委员会食堂烟囱的吸收装置较好，方法简单，制作容易。这种方法，就是在烟囱中部的外面，设一个水桶，用一根竹管通到烟囱里，一端连着水桶，另一端安上喷咀。有自来水的可安装自来水喷咀。喷咀是用白铁皮作成的，它的直径为烟囱直径的一半，安装时喷咀向上，这样喷出来的水比较均匀。
    在烧煤时，烟不断往烟囱里去，当它遇上喷水即起化学作用（烟中含二氧化硫、铵），变成煤烟和水的混合物流出。以后，用杠炭滤的渣滓，再经过加高温度，冷却后，即成硫酸铵（未去胶质时是黄色，颗粒）。　　　　　　　　　　中国农业科学院　　陈示宗
