Qinghai, March 30th (From Our Newspaper) - Production teams in people's communes across Qinghai Province are paying attention to preventing the emergence of three types of seedlings during spring plowing and sowing. Currently, the spring plowing and sowing of early field crops throughout the province is advancing from the lower reaches to the upper reaches, from the plains to the mountains, at a rate higher than in any previous year. A province-wide comparison and competition movement, centered on improving sowing quality by every possible means, is unfolding magnificently among communes, production teams, and individual members.

This year, preparatory work in various parts of Qinghai has been particularly meticulous. The land for over four million mu of early field crops across the province has generally undergone strict preparation. In addition to using various improved varieties, seeds have been screened, winnowed, inspected, and sunned, as well as treated with chemicals and mixed with manure. Some seeds have even undergone water selection and grain selection. In vigorously promoting rational close planting, various localities have held on-site meetings at all levels to discuss the use of close planting tools and to familiarize people with the operating procedures, in conjunction with the newly made and improved close planting tools. Some places even conducted trial planting in advance. This year, all localities have paid particular attention to fertilizer, generally reaching about 50,000 jin per mu, with some reaching over 100,000 jin. Many places, while ensuring timely sowing, have also put forward requirements such as sufficient fertilizer, level ground, and treated seeds, ensuring improved sowing quality.

To ensure sowing quality and strive for full, even, and vigorous seedlings this year, all localities have formulated practical and feasible sowing technical operating procedures on the basis of mobilizing the masses for full airing of views, full debate, and have established and improved the responsibility system, implementing it in every field. The communes in Minhe County have adopted the method of sowing, summarizing, and adding measures simultaneously. The tens of thousands of mu of wheat crops sown in the first batch throughout the county, from fertilization to sowing and from strip sowing to harrowing, are better than in any previous year.

Currently, late-planting areas are still rushing to accumulate and deliver fertilizer; wheat in early-planting areas is breaking ground and sprouting, and some seedlings are already an inch high, growing more evenly than ever before. The neat wheat seedlings are inspiring every member, who have already begun to prepare for topdressing, watering, and other field management measures. (Jin Yuanming)

Chongqing, March 30th (From Our Newspaper) - In the upsurge of the mass production competition centered on spring planting in Sichuan Province, various measures are being actively taken to ensure quality.

This year's spring planting work in Sichuan Province is unfolding in a heated province-wide rural production competition. The competitions in various localities have taken the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" as the central content, focusing prominently on several important links such as deep plowing and fertilization, sowing improved varieties, and rational close planting. In view of the fact that the thoroughness of implementing various measures has a great impact on the role of the "Eight-Point Charter," all localities have paid special attention to quality; on the one hand, they have taken quality comparison as the main condition for competition evaluation, and on the other hand, they have promptly formulated technical requirements for various measures. The province plans that all cultivated land for spring crops should be deep-plowed to a depth of one chi or more, at least 50,000 jin of base fertilizer should be applied per mu, the main crops such as rice, corn, and cotton should be planted with improved varieties, and all crops should be rationally closely planted according to local conditions. In addition, they should be sown on time and in sufficient quantities. At all levels, special districts, counties, and communes have formulated technical specifications on this basis, listed them as the content of the competition, and taken a series of measures to promote their realization. Subsequently, a consensus was quickly reached, thus providing a guarantee for the implementation of technology.

In the competition, mass inspections were widely carried out in various localities. Many counties in Nanchong, Jiangjin, Yibin and other special districts organized inspection teams at all levels to patrol within the county, district and commune respectively. The inspection teams labored and inspected simultaneously, commending the advanced and helping the backward. In a recent "Four Checks and Four Comparisons" major inspection in Dazu County, which included "checking the area, checking the amount of seeds used, checking the technical specifications, and checking the management," more than 2,000 cadres and masses participated throughout the county, organizing more than 100 inspection teams.

Establishing an acceptance system and carrying out mass acceptance work are also common measures taken in various localities. Party committee secretaries and commune cadres at all levels in Jiang'an County personally led the acceptance work, issuing certificates of conformity to those who passed and organizing rework in a timely manner for those who failed. In the first batch of 30,000 mu of early rice seedling fields accepted in this county, 2,000 mu of unqualified seedling fields were blocked in time.

In order to make spring planting fast and good, party committee leaders at all levels in Sichuan went deep into the front line to strengthen leadership. Through experimental fields and working together with the masses, the vast number of cadres in various localities have timely summarized a large amount of experience and discovered and solved many problems.

    准备充足  种植细致
    青海四川春播质量显著提高
    本报西宁30日电　青海省各人民公社的生产队，在春耕播种中就注意防止三类苗的出现。目前，全省早田作物的春耕播种，正从下川到上川、平川到山地，以高于以往任何一年的速度向前挺进。一个以千方百计提高播种质量为中心的评比竞赛运动，正在全省的公社与公社、生产队与生产队以及社员个人之间波澜壮阔地开展起来。
    今年，青海各地备耕工作做得特别细致。全省四百多万亩早田作物，土地一般都经过严格整理，种子除采用各种良种外，还经过筛、簸、检、晒以及药剂和粪肥拌种，有的还经过水选和粒选。在大力推行合理密植方面，各地都结合新制和改制密植工具，逐级召开了有关使用密植工具和熟悉操作过程的现场会议；有的地方还提前进行了试播。今年各地对肥料这一关抓得特别紧，一般每亩达到五万斤左右，多的达到十万斤以上。许多地方还在保证适时播种的前提下，提出了必须肥足、地平和种子经过处理等要求，保证了播种质量的提高。
    为了确保播种质量，力争今年苗全、苗匀、苗旺，各地都在发动群众大鸣大放、大辩论的基础上，制定了切实可行的播种技术操作规程，并建立和健全责任制，贯彻到每一块田。民和县各公社采取边播种、边总结、边添措施的办法，全县首批播种的几万亩麦类作物，从施肥到下种，从条播到耙耱，比以往任何一年都好。
    现在，迟种地区还在突击积肥、送肥；早种地区的小麦正在破土露芽，有的已经苗高一寸，长得比以往特别均匀。整齐的麦苗鼓舞着每个社员，他们已着手准备追肥、浇水等田间管理措施。（金元明）
    本报重庆30日电　四川省在以春播为中心内容的群众生产竞赛热潮中，积极采取各种措施保证质量。
    今年四川省春播工作是在全省农村热烈的生产竞赛中展开的。各地的竞赛都把全面贯彻“八字宪法”作为中心内容，突出地抓紧了深耕施肥、播种良种和合理密植等几个重要环节。鉴于贯彻各种措施是否彻底对“八字宪法”发挥作用有很大影响，各地都特别注意质量；一方面把比质量作为竞赛评比的主要条件，另一方面及时订出各种措施的技术要求。全省计划，大春作物耕地全部要深翻一尺以上，每亩施底肥至少五万斤，水稻、玉米、棉花等主要作物实现良种化，各种作物都要因地制宜地合理密植，此外还要按时播种，用足数量。各专区、县和公社都层层在这一基础上制订技术规格，列为竞赛的内容，并采取了一系列措施促其实现。以后，很快就统一了认识，从而为贯彻技术提供了保证。
    在竞赛中，各地广泛开展了群众性的大检查。南充、江津、宜宾等专区许多县层层组织了检查团分别在县、区和公社范围内巡回。检查团边劳动、边检查，表扬先进，帮助落后。大足县最近开展的一次“查面积、查用种量、查技术规格、查管理”的四查四比大检查中，全县干部、群众有两千多人参加，组织了一百多个检查组。
    建立验收制度，开展群众性的验收工作，也是各地普遍采取的措施。江安县各级党委书记和公社干部都亲自领导验收工作，合格的发给合格证，不合格的及时组织返工。这个县验收第一批三万亩早稻秧田中，便及时挡住了两千亩不合格的秧田。
    为了使春播又快又好，四川各级党委负责人都深入第一线加强领导。各地广大干部通过试验田以及和群众共同劳动，及时总结了大量经验，发现和解决了不少问题。（附图片）
