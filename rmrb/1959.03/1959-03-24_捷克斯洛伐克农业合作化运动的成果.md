Achievements of the Czechoslovak Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

Czechoslovakia is a highly industrialized country, but its agriculture also occupies an important position in the national economy. The Czechoslovak agricultural cooperativization movement began after the land reform in 1948, which eliminated large land ownership. In 1948 and 1949, farmers began to organize unified agricultural cooperatives. By the beginning of 1956, the number of unified agricultural cooperatives had grown from more than 1,900 in 1949 to 7,000. However, the greater climax of the agricultural cooperativization movement was in the last two years. At the time of the Third Congress of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives held in March 1957, Czechoslovakia had more than 8,000 unified agricultural cooperatives, with nearly 500,000 members and a cultivated area of 2.2 million hectares; by the end of 1958, the number of cooperatives had increased to 12,140, with more than 850,000 members and a cultivated area of 4.6 million hectares (accounting for 62% of the country's agricultural land). If the approximately one million hectares of state-owned farms are added, the socialist components in the countryside account for more than three-quarters of the country's agricultural land. The development achievements of agricultural cooperatives in 1957 and 1958 were almost equivalent to the total of the previous years before 1956. In the first two months of 1959, the agricultural cooperativization movement made new progress.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government have given great attention to the agricultural cooperativization movement. In the spring of 1957, the Czechoslovak government announced a system of simplifying production and procurement plans. From July to September of the same year, the Party and the government promptly solved the problem of adjusting the distribution network of tractors. In the spring of 1958, the Czechoslovak government further reorganized the organizational form of tractor stations, changed the past regulations that concentrated agricultural machinery in machine tractor stations, and cooperatives could fully purchase all necessary agricultural machinery.

In June 1958, the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party summarized the achievements of Czechoslovak agricultural cooperativization over the past ten years, and further proposed the future direction and goals of agricultural development: to establish a highly mechanized, widely used chemical fertilizer, high yield per unit area of modern socialist agriculture; by 1965, agricultural production should increase by about 40% compared with 1957, and agricultural labor productivity should be increased by about one time.

In 1958, Czechoslovak agriculture achieved great results. Agricultural products increased by 3.4% compared to the previous year, the total output value of grain increased by 5.9%, and the amount of grain sold by unified agricultural cooperatives to the state almost doubled compared to 1957. At present, half of the country's unified agricultural cooperatives have guaranteed to complete the agricultural production increase tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) one year ahead of schedule.

With the progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture, a cultural revolution is progressing smoothly in the Czechoslovak countryside. Illiteracy has long been eliminated in the Czechoslovak countryside, and the educational level of farmers is generally relatively high. At present, almost every agricultural cooperative has its own training courses for agricultural and animal husbandry technical cadres. There are more than 14,000 libraries in the countryside, with more than 18 million books. (Soviet)

    捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化运动的成果
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个高度工业化的国家，但是它的农业在国民经济中也占着重要的地位。捷克斯洛伐克的农业合作化运动是在1948年实行土地改革消灭了大土地所有制以后开始的。在1948和1949年，农民们即开始组织起统一农业合作社，到1956年初，统一农业合作社由1949年的一千九百多个发展到七千个。但是农业合作化运动的更大高潮还是在最近两年。在1957年3月举行第三届统一农业合作社代表大会的时候，捷克斯洛伐克共有八千多个统一农业合作社，近五十万名社员，耕地面积达二百二十万公顷；而到1958年底，合作社数目已增加到一万二千一百四十个，八十五万多名社员，耕地面积达四百六十万公顷（占全国农业用地的62％）。如果再加上国营农场的约一百万公顷土地在内，农村里的社会主义成份已占全国农地的四分之三以上。在1957和1958两年，农业合作社的发展成就，几乎相当于1956年以前几年的总和。1959年的头两个月里，农业合作化运动又取得了新的进展。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府对农业合作化运动给予极大的关怀。在1957年春季，捷克斯洛伐克政府宣布了简化生产和收购计划的制度。同年7月到9月，党和政府又及时解决了调整拖拉机分布网的问题。1958年春季，捷克斯洛伐克政府进一步改组了拖拉机站的组织形式，改变了过去把农业机器集中在机器拖拉机站的规定，合作社可以充分购买一切必需的农业机器。
    1958年6月，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会总结了十年来捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化的成果，并进一步提出了今后农业发展的方针和目标：建立高度机械化的、广泛使用化学肥料的、单位面积产量高的现代化社会主义农业；到1965年，农业生产要比1957年增长约40％，农业劳动生产率要提高大约一倍。
    1958年，捷克斯洛伐克的农业取得了巨大的成绩，农产品比前一年增加了3.4％，谷物总产值增加了5.9％，统一农业合作社向国家缴售的谷物几乎比1957年增加一倍。目前全国已经有半数统一农业合作社作出保证，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960）所规定的农业增产任务。
    随着农业社会主义改造的进展，在捷克斯洛伐克农村中正顺利进行着文化革命。捷克斯洛伐克的农村中早已消灭了文盲，农民的文化程度一般都比较高。目前差不多每个农业合作社都有自己训练农业和畜牧业技术干部的学习班。在农村中有一万四千多个图书馆，拥有一千八百多万册图书。　　　　　（苏）
