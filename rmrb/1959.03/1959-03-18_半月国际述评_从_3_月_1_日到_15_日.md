    Semi-Monthly International Review
    --From March 1st to 15th--
    The Struggle Continues Between Two Policies on Germany
    Over the past half-month, the German question has remained a central issue in the international situation. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has reiterated its determination to eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin and conclude a peace treaty with Germany, while repeatedly expressing its willingness to consult with Western countries to seek a reasonable solution to the problem. On the other hand, the United States, along with its Western partners, continues to stubbornly resist and stall for time.
    In its reply of March 2nd to the Western countries regarding the German and Berlin issues, the Soviet government advocated a swift convening of a summit conference of relevant countries to discuss and resolve outstanding international issues to ease international tensions. At the same time, it also supported holding a meeting of Eastern and Western foreign ministers, with the participation of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, to discuss issues related to the peace treaty with Germany and the status of West Berlin, with the participation of the two Germanies. During the Soviet-British summit talks that concluded on March 3rd, both sides reached an agreement on the principle of peacefully resolving the German question through East-West negotiations. Subsequently, Comrade Khrushchev visited the German Democratic Republic and held talks with the leaders of the German Democratic Republic government. Both sides believed that a peaceful solution to the German question is currently of particular urgency, and that concluding a peace treaty with Germany is the most important and pressing measure. Both sides expressed their willingness for the four major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—to guarantee the status of West Berlin as a free city, and agreed to the participation of the United Nations in such guarantees. All of this demonstrates the Soviet Union's willingness to make every effort to create more possibilities for a peaceful resolution of this issue. This reflects the Soviet Union's great concern for the interests of the German people and for safeguarding peace in Europe and the world.
    American officials have repeatedly expressed "not very optimistic" views about the prospects for peaceful negotiations, considering the idea of holding a top-level conference as "based on subjective wishes." Others have adopted open war cries and threats of force. Defense Secretary McElroy said that if war breaks out in Berlin, it would be difficult to make it a "limited war," and that "ground forces will be used to keep the roads to West Berlin open." President Eisenhower himself made a nuclear war blackmail appearance on March 11. However, this American threat of force does not demonstrate its strength but rather serves to mask its own panic and unease. While issuing war cries and creating a tense atmosphere, the American ruling clique is making every effort to stall for time through various means. They want to play tricks on the issues of participants, agenda, and length of East-West talks to obstruct any genuine progress towards a peaceful resolution of the German question.
    There are now differences among Western countries regarding their strategies on the German question. After visiting the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Macmillan rushed to France and West Germany to hold talks with De Gaulle and Adenauer, and will soon go to the United States to meet with Eisenhower to mend the cracks and adjust their steps. However, because the four Western powers have their own agendas, Macmillan's trip to Western Europe has apparently failed to eliminate "all differences of opinion" between himself and France and West Germany. Instead, his activities have been met with suspicion from France, West Germany, and the Western leader, the United States. Adenauer and De Gaulle have repeatedly expressed their aversion to this, and "Washington is very shocked and somewhat annoyed by Britain's efforts to seize leadership" (according to the "New York Herald Tribune"). In order to coordinate their differences and discuss common strategies, the Western countries have decided to hold a meeting of their foreign ministers in the near future after frequent bilateral contacts.
    The Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness to negotiate with the West on a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. People are now closely watching the next steps taken by Western countries.
    The Japanese People are Launching a New Wave of Struggle
    Over the past half-month, the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy has been surging across the country.
    Four million Japanese workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and neutral trade unions, following the first unified action of the Spring Struggle on February 25th, held the second unified action day on March 4th. In addition to conducting strength struggles, Japanese trade unions also held rallies across the country. The Spring Struggle is traditionally a struggle carried out annually by the Japanese working class to demand improved living conditions and defend workers' rights. However, this year, in addition to demanding wage increases and guaranteeing workers' rights, political slogans such as opposing the revision and demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi government have been raised. The north and south routes of the National Grand March Against War and Unemployment, after a long journey, also successfully arrived in Tokyo on March 4th, holding a "Central General Rally of the National Grand March Against War and Unemployment" with the participation of 30,000 people from all walks of life in Tokyo. Along the way from Fukuoka in Kyushu and Fukushima in Hokkaido to Tokyo, these two marching teams held rallies with the people of many cities, with a total of more than one million people participating in the marches. Currently, the Japanese working class's Spring Struggle is continuing, with waves of strikes rising one after another. The movement to ban nuclear weapons is also developing vigorously. According to the recent announcement by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the number of signatures demanding a ban on nuclear weapons has increased to 35 million, accounting for about 40% of the total population of Japan. The Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and others have recently decided to establish the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," preparing to launch a high tide in the movement to prevent the revision of this treaty on April 15th. This movement against the Nobusuke Kishi government's reactionary policies is a new high tide of struggle for the Japanese people following the victory against the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill."
    The new upsurge in the Japanese people's struggle is inseparable from the current situation in Japan. Since suffering a crushing defeat last winter on the issue of revising the "Police Duties Execution Law," the Nobusuke Kishi government's ruling position has been greatly weakened. Coupled with the intensification of factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party, the political situation has been unstable. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government has not changed its plan to revive militarism due to this unfavorable situation. On the contrary, it is more eager to form a military alliance with the United States to realize its ambitions for external expansion, and attempts to rely on the support of U.S. imperialism to suppress the peaceful and democratic forces in Japan. In addition, in order to solve the increasingly serious economic crisis in Japan, in addition to adopting measures to expand financial investment and reduce operating rates, the Nobusuke Kishi government also attempts to use U.S. capital to expand outward. This situation has deepened the Japanese ruling class's dependence on the United States. The United States, due to its own unfavorable situation, is eager to pull Japan into the U.S. Far East aggression system to serve as its vanguard. This is why the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government have recently intensified the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and are preparing to complete the revision within March and April.
    If the aggressive conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries succeeds, Japan will undertake the obligation to protect U.S. military bases in the name of "joint defense." The United States will also intensify its nuclear armament of Japan, making Japan a permanent U.S. base in the Far East. Therefore, Japan is currently at a critical juncture in determining its national destiny: either allowing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and letting the Nobusuke Kishi government gamble the fate of the Japanese nation on war adventures, or preventing the revision of this treaty and opening up a path towards neutrality and peaceful coexistence.
    The struggle currently being widely carried out in Japan fully demonstrates the determination of the broad masses of the Japanese people to take the path of peace and neutrality. Of course, this road is not smooth. Because the United States will never easily relax its control over Japan, and because the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups represented by the Nobusuke Kishi government are eager to realize their latent imperialist ambitions, the Japanese people's struggle will be long-term and arduous. But despite this, as long as all forces in Japan opposing U.S. imperialism and the reactionary policies of Nobusuke Kishi strengthen their unity in the struggle, the struggle will surely be victorious. The recent decision of the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party to take joint action in the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is good news for all those who sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Japanese people. It can be believed that Japan's peaceful and democratic forces will achieve greater success in further joint actions and cooperation.
    New Situation in the Anti-Colonialist Struggle in Central Africa
    The struggle of the people of Central Africa against British colonial rule and racial discrimination has seen new developments in recent times. Despite the bloody suppression by the colonial authorities, the anti-colonialist struggle of Africans in this region has reached an unprecedentedly large scale. In Nyasaland, mass struggles are unfolding daily in dozens of places from the southern Blantyre and Limbe regions to Karonga in the north. This struggle has attracted the participation of a wide range of people. Large numbers of workers, peasants, students, and the bourgeoisie are joining the ranks of the struggle in an endless stream. Under the threat of bayonets, they hold demonstrations, strikes, and market boycotts, fearlessly rushing into prisons to rescue their compatriots, unexpectedly attacking colonial military patrols, and sabotaging road transport. Tens of thousands of Africans have even abandoned their homes and possessions and poured into the mountains and jungles, preparing to resist the colonialists for a long time.
    While the people of Nyasaland are engaged in a heroic struggle, the people of Northern and Southern Rhodesia in Central Africa and British East Africa and South Africa are providing strong mutual support. Following the demonstrations in Mwinilunga in early March, the people of Northern Rhodesia recently held large-scale struggles in the capital Lusaka, using sticks and stones to fight back against the repression of the colonial police. Thousands of African workers at the Kariba Dam in Southern Rhodesia have been on strike for more than half a month despite persecution by the colonial authorities. In Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, the Union of South Africa, and other places, the struggle for national independence and against racial discrimination has continued unabated, shaking the colonial system throughout the African region south of the equator. All of this fully demonstrates that the colonialists in Africa have fallen into a situation of being besieged on all sides. The British "Times" helplessly admitted: "The psychological state of the British African colonists is like that of people sitting on the slopes of a volcano. They now know there is a lot of lava, but hope it will not erupt while they are alive."
    In order to save the collapse of the colonial system, the British colonialists are desperately making a last-ditch struggle. The British colonialists even fabricated the excuse that the African National Congress was "preparing to assassinate European, Asian, and moderate African leaders," declared a "state of emergency" in Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia, and banned all activities of the African National Congress. Not only that, but the British colonial authorities also mobilized large numbers of colonial troops from Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika to conduct large-scale arrests and massacres of the unarmed people of Nyasaland. Since the declaration of a "state of emergency" in Nyasaland, in just nine days, according to the obviously reduced figures published by the British colonial authorities, 41 Africans have been killed and 400 members of the African National Congress have been arrested. In Central Africa and other East African colonies, British colonialists are also frantically conducting arrests and persecutions.
    The bloody suppression and terror rule of the British colonialists against the people of Central Africa has not only aroused greater struggles among the people of Central Africa; but has also aroused angry condemnation from the public in African and Asian countries. The people of Ghana have held rallies and demonstrations for days; major political parties in Guinea have protested against the atrocities of the British colonialists. Today's African national liberation movement has broken away from the isolated and helpless situation, while it is the vicious colonialists who are truly isolated. The colonialists could not stop the vigorous development of the African national independence movement in the past, and they are even less able to save the final demise of colonial rule in Africa today.

    半月国际述评
    ——从3月1日到15日——
    两种对德政策继续斗争
    最近半个月来，德国问题仍然是国际局势的一个中心。一方面，苏联重申力求消除西柏林占领制度和缔结对德和约的决心，同时又一再表示愿意同西方国家进行协商，以求得问题的合理解决。而美国同它的西方伙伴们，却仍想负隅顽抗，进行拖延。
    苏联政府在3月2日给西方国家的关于德国和柏林问题的复照中，主张迅速召开有关国家政府首脑会议来讨论和解决悬而未决的国际问题以缓和国际紧张局势。同时它也赞成先召开有苏、美、英、法、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克参加的东西方外长会议，在两个德国的参加下来讨论与对德和约和西柏林地位有关的问题。在3月3日结束的苏英两国政府首脑会谈中，双方也就通过东西方谈判来和平解决德国问题的原则取得了协议。接着，赫鲁晓夫同志又到德意志民主共和国进行访问，同德意志民主共和国政府领导人进行了会谈。双方认为和平解决德国问题目前具有特别迫切的意义，而缔结对德和约则是一个最重要、最迫切的措施。双方表示愿意由苏、美、英、法四大国来保证西柏林的自由城市地位，并同意联合国参加这种保证。这一切都说明，苏联愿意尽一切努力来为和平解决这个问题创造更多的可能性。这正表现了苏联对德国人民的利益、对维护欧洲与世界和平的利益的极大关怀。
    美国官方人士一再地对和平谈判的前景表示“不太乐观”，认为关于举行最高级会议的意见是“出自主观愿望的”。另一部分人则采取了公开的战争叫嚣和武力恫吓。国防部长麦克耳罗伊说，如果柏林爆发战争，很难使它成为“有限战争”，“为了使到西柏林的道路畅通，将要使用地面部队。艾森豪威尔总统也在3月11日亲自出马来进行核战争的讹诈了。不过，美国这种武力恫吓并不足表明它的强大，而是借此掩饰它自己的惊慌不安。美国统治集团一面发出战争叫嚣，制造紧张气氛，一面则竭力企图以各种手段进行拖延。它们想在东西方会谈的参加成员、议程内容和会议时间长短的问题上玩弄花样，以阻挠和平解决德国问题取得真正的进展。
    现在西方国家在对待德国问题的策略上存在着分歧。英国首相麦克米伦在访问苏联以后，又仆仆风尘地前往法国、西德，同戴高乐和阿登纳举行会谈，不久以后还要到美国去会见艾森豪威尔，以弥补裂缝，调整步骤。但是，由于西方四国各怀鬼胎，麦克米伦的西欧之行显然并未能消除它同法国和西德之间的“全部意见分歧”。倒是他的活动，遭到了法国、西德和西方盟主美国的猜忌。阿登纳和戴高乐一再对此表示反感，而“华盛顿方面对英国这种争取领导地位的行动，也表示很大的震惊和有点恼火”（“纽约先驱论坛报”语）。为了协调它们之间的分歧，商讨共同的对策，西方国家在频繁的双边接触之后，还决定要在最近召开它们的外长会议。
    苏联已经一再地表示愿意同西方谈判缔结对德和约和西柏林问题。现在人们正在密切注视着西方国家下一步的行动。
    日本人民正在掀起新的斗争高潮
    这半个月来，日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的斗争，正在日本全国各地汹涌高涨。
    属于日本工会总评议会和中立工会的四百万日本工人，继2月25日发动春季斗争的第一次统一行动之后，3月4日又举行了第二次统一行动日。日本各个工会除了进行实力斗争，还在全国各地召开奋起大会。春季斗争原是日本工人阶级每年进行的要求改善生活待遇、保卫工人权利的传统性的斗争；但今年除了要求提高工资、保障工人权利以外，还提出了反对修改和（要求）废除日美“安全条约”、要求恢复日中邦交和打倒岸信介政府等政治口号。参加日本人民反对战争和失业国民大游行的南北两路队伍，经过长途跋涉，也在3月4日胜利到达东京；同东京各阶层人民举行了共有三万人参加的“反对战争和失业国民大游行中央总奋起大会”。这两路游行队伍在从九州的福冈和北海道的福岛到东京的一路上，同许多城市的人民举行了大会；先后共有一百多万人参加了游行。目前，日本工人阶级的春季斗争正在继续开展，罢工浪潮此起彼伏。要求禁止核武器的运动也在蓬勃地发展。据日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协会最近宣布，签名要求禁止核武器的人数已经增加到三千五百万人，约占日本总人口的40％。日本社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会等最近决定成立“阻止修改和争取废除日美安全条约国民会议”，准备在4月15日掀起阻止修改这项条约运动的高潮。这个反对岸信介政府反动政策的运动是日本人民继反对“警职法修正案”胜利之后的一次新的斗争高潮。
    日本人民斗争的新高涨，是和当前日本的局势分不开的。岸信介政府自从去年冬天在修改“警职法”这个问题上遭到惨重失败以后，统治地位大大削弱；加上自由民主党内部的派系斗争激化，政局一直陷于不稳。但是岸信介政府，并没有因为这种不利的局面而改变它复活军国主义的计划。相反，它更急于同美国结成军事同盟，实现它对外扩张的野心；并且企图凭借美国帝国主义的支撑来镇压日本和平民主力量。此外，为了解救目前日本日趋严重的经济危机，岸信介政府除了采取扩大财政投资和缩减开工率的办法外，还企图利用美国资本向外扩张。这种种情况使得日本统治阶级对美国的依赖进一步加深。而美国也因自身的景况不妙，急于把日本拉入美国的远东侵略体系，替它打前锋。这正是美国和岸信介政府最近为什么加紧修改日美“安全条约”，并准备在3、4月内完成改订的原因。
    美日反动派的侵略阴谋如果得逞，日本就将在“共同防御”的名义下，承担保卫美国军事基地的义务。美国也将对日本加紧进行核武装，使日本成为美国在远东的永久基地。因此，日本目前正处在决定它的民族命运的严重关头：或是容许修改日美“安全条约”，听任岸信介政府把日本民族的命运来做战争冒险的赌注；或是阻止修改这项条约、开辟通往中立、和平共处的方向的道路。
    日本当前正在广泛开展中的斗争，充分表明日本广大人民决心走和平中立的道路。当然，这条道路并不是平坦的。由于美国决不会轻易放松它对日本的控制，也由于以岸信介政府为代表的日本垄断资本集团，急于实现它潜在的帝国主义野心，日本人民的斗争将是长期的和艰苦的。但尽管如此，只要日本反对美帝国主义和岸信介反动政策的各方面的力量在斗争中加强团结，斗争就一定能够取得胜利。日本社会党最近同日本共产党在反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中采取联合行动的决定，对于一切同情和支持日本人民正义斗争的人们来说，这是一个喜讯。可以相信，日本的和平民主力量在进一步采取的联合行动和团结合作中，必将取得更大的成就。
    中非反殖民主义斗争的新形势
    中非洲人民反抗英国殖民统治和种族歧视的斗争在最近时期有了新的发展。尽管殖民当局进行血腥镇压，但是这一地区的非洲人反殖民主义的斗争达到了空前广大的规模。在尼亚萨兰，从南方的布兰太尔和林贝地区到北方的卡龙加，每天数十处地方的群众展开着统一的斗争。这个斗争已经吸引了广泛阶层人民的参加。大批的工人、农民、学生和资产阶级，络绎不绝地参加到斗争的行列里。他们在刺刀的威胁下举行示威游行、罢工、罢市，奋不顾身地冲进监狱抢救同胞，出其不意地袭击殖民军的巡逻队和破坏公路运输。成千上万的非洲人甚至弃家毁舍，涌入山区和丛林，准备长期抗击殖民主义者。
    在尼亚萨兰人民进行英勇斗争的同时，中非洲的南北罗得西亚与英属东非和南非人民，进行了有力的相互支持。北罗得西亚人民继3月初在姆维尼隆举行了示威游行后，最近又在首府卢萨喀举行大规模斗争，并用棍棒、石块回击殖民警察的镇压。南罗得西亚卡里巴水坝的数千非洲工人不顾殖民当局的迫害，坚持罢工已有半个多月。在怯尼亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀、南非联邦等地，争取民族独立和反对种族歧视的斗争，有增无已，整个赤道以南的非洲地区的殖民制度都发生了动摇。所有这一切充分说明殖民主义者在非洲已经陷入四面楚歌的境地。英国“泰晤士报”无可奈何地承认：“英属非洲殖民者的心理状态，和那些坐在火山斜坡上的人们的心理状态一样。他们现在知道有许多熔岩，但是希望他们活着的时候不要爆发。”
    英国殖民主义者为了挽救殖民制度的崩溃，正在不惜孤注一掷地作垂死挣扎。英国殖民者居然捏造非洲人国民大会“准备暗杀欧洲人、亚洲人和温和的非洲人的领袖”的借口，宣布尼亚萨兰和南罗得西亚处于“紧急状态”，并禁止非洲人国民大会的一切活动。不仅如此，英国殖民当局还从南罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀调动了大批殖民军队，对手无寸铁的尼亚萨兰人民进行了大规模的逮捕和屠杀。自从尼亚萨兰宣布“紧急状态”以来，历时不过九天，根据英国殖民当局公布了的显然缩小了的数字，已经有四十一名非洲人被打死、四百名非洲人国民大会会员遭逮捕。在中非和东非其它殖民地，英国殖民者也在疯狂地进行逮捕和迫害。
    英国殖民者对中非人民的血腥镇压和恐怖统治不仅激起了中非人民更大的斗争；而且已引起非洲和亚洲各国公众愤怒的谴责。加纳人民连日举行集会示威；几内亚各主要政党抗议英国殖民者的暴行。今天的非洲民族解放运动已经摆脱了孤立无援的形势，而真正孤立的却是穷凶极恶的殖民者。殖民主义者过去既阻挡不住非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，今天更没有力量挽救殖民统治在非洲的最后灭亡。
