Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. On February 3, 1959, Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, wrote to Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and attached a joint statement by the parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty dated January 21, 1959, and a statement by the Government of the German Democratic Republic on the issue of the peace treaty. In his letter, Chairman Dieckmann stated: "The special significance of these documents shows that the draft of the German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union and other proposals on the peaceful settlement of the German problem and the establishment of a normal status in West Berlin are increasingly becoming the most important subject of discussion in international public opinion at present and in the future. Therefore, in order to maintain and safeguard peace, the Presidium of the People's Chamber feels an urgent need for the parliaments of all former German enemy countries in particular to discuss these documents as soon as possible and make resolutions." On March 23, Chairman Liu Shaoqi replied to Chairman Dieckmann on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, expressing full support for the Soviet proposal to convene a peace conference to discuss and conclude a German peace treaty. The full text of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's reply is as follows:

Comrade Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic:

I have the honor to receive your letter of February 3, 1959, concerning the issue of concluding a German peace treaty, as well as the statements issued by the parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Government of the German Democratic Republic on January 21, 1959, respectively, regarding the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a German peace treaty.

I have carefully studied these two documents and fully support the solemn position expressed in both documents on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty. As stated in the statement by the parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic: "The conclusion of a peace treaty will promote a broad relaxation of tensions in the heart of Europe and provide a solid guarantee for European security."

I believe you must already know that the Government of the People's Republic of China, in its statement of January 21, 1959, and in its note to the Soviet government of March 19, 1959, clearly expressed its full support for the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a German peace treaty. Now, in the name of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, I reaffirm to you that the Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's proposal of January 10, 1959, to convene a peace conference to discuss and conclude a German peace treaty. I firmly believe that the sacred cause of the German people striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory with the universal support of all peace-loving people throughout the world.

Please accept my highest regards!

Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China

Beijing, March 23, 1959

    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼同志：
    我荣幸地接到了你在1959年2月3日寄给我的有关缔结对德和约问题的来信以及1959年1月21日德意志民主共和国人民议院各党团和德意志民主共和国政府分别就苏联政府提出的关于缔结对德和约问题所发表的声明。
    我仔细地研究了这两项文件，并且完全支持两个文件在缔结对德和约问题上所表明的严正立场。正如德意志民主共和国人民议院各党团的声明中所说：“和约的缔结会促使在欧洲心脏地区的紧张局势的广泛和缓，并且为欧洲的安全提供了牢固的保证。”
    我相信，你一定已经知道，中华人民共和国政府在1959年1月21日的声明中和在1959年3月19日给苏联政府的照会中，都明确地表示完全支持苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议。现在，我以中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的名义再次向你肯定，中国人民全力支持苏联政府1959年1月10日提出的关于召开和会讨论并缔结对德和约的建议。我深信，德意志人民争取和平统一自己祖国的神圣事业一定会在全世界一切爱好和平的人民的普遍支持下，取得最后的胜利。
    此致最崇高的敬意！
  中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长　刘少奇
                                  1959年3月23日于北京
