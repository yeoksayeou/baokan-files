(Our newspaper, Xi'an) The Eight Happiness Village Production Team of the Xiangcun Management District, Chengguan People's Commune, Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, is full of energy. This year, they are determined to continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity. Under the unified leadership of the commune, they will launch a new upsurge in production and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    Currently, this production team, located in the Weibei arid plateau area, is strengthening wheat field management in every possible way according to their bold slogan of "Fight for a hundred days, one season equals four years." They are determined to reverse the "black bottom of the pot" of low wheat yield and strive to increase the average wheat yield per mu from 78 jin last year to 1,500 jin this year. While striving for a bumper wheat harvest, all members of the team are also working hard on the field management of various summer grains and the preparation for cotton fields, ensuring that the total cotton output of the team will increase by more than four times compared with last year, and the total grain output will increase by more than ten times.
    Recently, a inspection team led by Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and responsible comrades from the Pucheng County Party Committee and the Party Committees of various communes in Pucheng, inspected the wheat fields of Eight Happiness Village at an on-site meeting. The inspection results showed that the wheat fields of this team were lush green, with level ridges and straight furrows, sufficient water and fertilizer, and the wheat seedlings were neat and strong, with normal development and tillering. Third-class seedlings accounted for only 9% of the total wheat field, and the effective tillering of most wheat fields was around one million plants. Therefore, everyone agreed that as long as the Eight Happiness Village Production Team continues to exert its efforts and do a good job in field management, it is entirely possible to achieve the target of 1,500 jin of wheat per mu.
    This production team is composed of 151 peasant households in the Eight Happiness natural village. Because it is located in an arid plateau area, with groundwater as deep as 35 meters, there was not a single irrigation well in the village before 1958. Half of the cultivated land was of very poor quality, which the local people called "cogongrass land." In the past, cultivation was also very extensive. Many lands were not plowed or fertilized before sowing. Therefore, although production has developed every year since liberation, the speed has been very slow, and there was still a shortage of food every year before 1958. In 1956, an advanced agricultural producers' cooperative was formed. At that time, the cooperative often had to allocate food and seeds from other villages with higher production levels to support Eight Happiness Village. During the rectification of the commune in the winter of 1957, some farmers from other villages posted big-character posters in Eight Happiness Village, criticizing them for not knowing how to farm. The entire team of Eight Happiness Village held several days of meetings for this purpose, hotly debating whether they could quickly turn around in production. At the meeting, all members of the team were full of energy and said in unison: "Roll up your sleeves and work hard, and we will see the results next year." The village branch also carried out education on "exerting all efforts, uniting in production, and self-reliance" among the members, and led the development of a bumper harvest competition in which everyone contributed ideas and efforts, and everyone compared their energy and measures. After the spring of 1958, all members of the team, regardless of the cold weather, dug 22 deep wells more than ten feet deep in the fields, and dug 50 cellars. The state provided a part of the production funds and seven waterwheels, and other teams also provided them with four waterwheels for support. Therefore, Eight Happiness Village, which had no irrigated land in history, had irrigated land for the first time. While vigorously developing water conservancy, autumn fields and cotton fields were deeply plowed more than six inches deep, and more than 6,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied, changing the old habit of not deeply plowing the land or applying base fertilizer before sowing. After sowing, timely field management work such as raking, harrowing, topdressing, weeding, and pest control were carried out. As a result, both autumn grain and cotton harvests were great last year, and for the first time, it changed from a food-deficient village to a surplus-grain village, and repaid state loans. The actual income of the members increased by 66% compared with 1957.
    The Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the establishment of people's communes boosted the Eight Happiness Village Production Team's confidence in striving to achieve a greater leap forward this year. Last winter and this spring, the village's cultivated land was deeply plowed from eight inches to one foot or more, and some were deeply plowed more than two feet; an average of more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied to all wheat fields, and some applied 30,000 jin, an increase of two to three times compared with last year; the amount of wheat sown was also increased from about 15 jin last year to 34 jin, and all seeds were treated with pesticides. In order to continue to solve the difficulty of insufficient water sources, the team members dug two more canals to gather the water from several wells into one stream, implementing parallel wells and long-distance flow; at the same time, men, women, old and young all came out to carry ice to moisten the fields and sweep snow to return to the fields, carrying out winter irrigation of wheat fields. Now they are continuing to deepen all the wells to ensure water for spring irrigation. In the spring production centered on wheat field management, the whole team also launched a mass tool reform movement, and improved labor organization and production management to solve the shortage of tools and labor. Recently, the whole team made 150 lightweight wooden handcarts (one per household) in one day and one night, which increased the efficiency of fertilizer delivery by more than one time and completed the topdressing of wheat fields in a timely manner. They squeezed out all the manpower that could be squeezed out in every link and invested it in the front line of production, greatly strengthening production. Twenty-four people were drawn from the cooks and other management personnel alone and put into wheat field management work. The production team leader, deputy team leader, Party branch secretary, and Communist Youth League branch secretary all directly served as the captains of four farmland professional teams, working with the team members, dividing the work and contracting the leadership of each professional team, which not only reduced the layers and saved labor, but also made the leadership more in-depth. Each professional team also implemented quota management and reward system, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency of the members have been greatly improved compared with the past.
    The soaring energy and great achievements of the Eight Happiness Village Production Team have greatly encouraged the vast number of peasants in the whole commune and neighboring counties. After the team challenged in early March with the target of 1,500 jin of wheat per mu, all 84 production teams in the commune enthusiastically responded. The vast number of members were determined to "learn from Eight Happiness and catch up with Eight Happiness," and make wheat field management work more and more detailed, not letting go of an inch, and strive to achieve a double thousand jin per mu of wheat. The Caiwang Village Production Team, like the Eight Happiness Team, has poor production conditions. The day after the Eight Happiness Team issued the challenge, they held a meeting of all members of the team to revise the target and add more measures to ensure that the wheat yield per mu this year will be four times higher than last year. For more than half a month, the members have been working hard day and night in shifts, rain or shine. Now all the wheat fields have been topdressed and weeded once, and a large amount of grass ash has been applied to each mu to prevent lodging. Many members send more than 30 carts of manure to the fields every day, and their labor efficiency has increased tenfold compared with the past. In addition to timely fertilization, irrigation, and weeding of all wheat fields, the production teams in Chengguan Management District have also applied an additional 130,000 jin of soil fertilizer and human manure to more than 800 mu of third-class wheat fields. The third-class seedlings have been upgraded continuously, and the second-class seedlings have been keeping pace with the first-class seedlings. All 60 semi-finished wells in the entire management district were repaired and put into spring irrigation in a few days, and the daily output of the 12 soil fertilizer plants has increased from 7,000 jin to 110,000 jin. Communes and production teams in Hancheng, Bin County, Qian County, and other counties, which are also located in the Weibei arid plateau area, have also responded to the Eight Happiness Team one after another. Together with the peasants of Pucheng County, they have launched a red flag competition to win the title of thousand-jin county of wheat in the Weibei arid plateau area. The 840,000 mu of wheat fields in Hancheng County originally planned to produce 600 jin per mu. After receiving the challenge letter from the Eight Happiness Team, the members immediately launched a competition in the county to "increase the target, add measures, boost morale, strive for the upstream, break the thousand jin, and win the red flag," vowing to achieve the goal of thousand-jin county of wheat this year. The production teams in Jufeng Management District of Zhichuan Commune worked hard for eight days and nights, and applied topdressing to more than 4,800 mu of wheat, and all the irrigated land was irrigated. The county has recently accumulated 13.2 billion jin of fertilizer, and the topdressing, spring irrigation, weeding and other tasks of wheat fields have progressed rapidly.

    公社生产队劲大志高
    喜见农村新高潮来到
    八福村生产队力保粮棉大增产，“学八福、赶八福”在陕西各地热烈展开
    本报西安讯　陕西蒲城县城关人民公社翔村管理区八福村生产队，全队社员干劲冲天，今年决心继续发扬苦干实干巧干精神，在公社统一领导下掀起新的生产高潮，力争实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
    目前，这个地处渭北旱原地区的生产队，正根据他们提出的“大战一百天，一季顶四年”的豪迈口号，千方百计地加强麦田管理，立志把小麦低产的“黑锅底”翻过来，力争今年小麦平均亩产由去年的七十八斤提高到一千五百斤。在力争小麦大丰收的同时，全队社员还抓紧进行各项夏杂粮的田间管理和棉田的备耕工作。保证全队棉花总产量比去年增长四倍多，粮食总产量增长十倍多。
    最近，由中共陕西省委第一书记张德生率领的检查团和蒲城县委、蒲城各公社党委的负责同志，在一次现场会议上对八福村的麦田做了一次检查。检查结果表明：这个队的麦田一片葱绿，畦平垅直，水饱肥足，麦苗整齐而茁壮，发育和分蘖都很正常，三类苗只占全部麦田的9％，大部麦田的有效分蘖都在一百万株左右。因此，大家一致认为，八福村生产队只要继续鼓足干劲，做好田间管理，实现小麦亩产一千五百斤的指标是完全可能的。
    这个生产队是由八福自然村的一百五十一户农民组成的。由于地处旱原，地下水源深达三十五公尺，全村在1958年以前没有一口浇地水井，一半耕地土质很坏，当地群众称为“茅草之地”；过去耕作又非常粗放，不少土地下种前不翻地不施肥，因此解放后每年生产虽有发展，但速度很慢，1958年以前仍然年年缺粮。1956年，组成了一个高级农业生产合作社。那时，社里经常要从其他生产水平较高的村庄拨口粮和籽种支援八福村。1957年冬整社时，有些外村的农民，曾到八福村贴大字报，批评他们不会务庄稼。八福村全体社员为此连续举行了几天社员大会，热烈辩论了究竟能不能在生产上迅速翻身。会上，全体社员都憋足一股劲，齐声说：“挽起袖子大干一场，来年再见高低”。村支部又在社员中进行了“鼓足干劲、团结生产、自力更生”的教育，领导开展了人人献计献策，人人比干劲、比措施的丰产竞赛。1958年开春以后，全体社员不管天寒地冻，在地里打下了二十二个深有十多丈的水井，挖了五十个水窖，国家贷给了一部分生产用款和七部水车，其他队也供给他们水车四部，进行支援，因而有史以来都没有水浇地的八福村，破天荒地有了水地。在大搞水利的同时，秋田和棉田都深翻六寸多，施底肥六千多斤，改变了过去下种前不深翻地不施底肥的旧习。下种后，及时进行了耙耱、追肥、锄草、防虫等各项田间管理工作。结果，去年秋粮和棉花都获得了大丰收，第一次由缺粮村变成了余粮村，并且偿还了国家贷款，社员实际收入比1957年增加了66％。
    1958年的大跃进和人民公社成立，鼓舞了八福村生产队力争今年实现更大跃进的信心。去冬今春，这个村的耕地都深翻八寸到一尺以上，有的深翻二尺以上；全部麦田平均施底肥两万多斤，有的施了三万斤，比去年增加两倍到三倍；小麦的下种量也由去年的十五斤左右增加到三十四斤，并且全部种子都进行过药剂拌种。为继续解决水源不足的困难，社员们又挖了两道渠道，把几个水井的水汇成一股，实行并井远流；同时男女老幼一齐出动，在严冬中背冰润田，扫雪归田，进行麦田冬灌，现在他们正在把所有水井继续掏深，以保证春灌用水。在以麦田管理为中心的春季生产中，全队还开展了群众性的工具改革运动，并且改善劳动组织和生产管理，以解决工具和劳力不足的困难。最近，全队一天一夜就做成轻便木制手推车一百五十辆（每户一辆），使送肥效率提高一倍以上，及时完成了麦田追肥。他们在各个环节中挤出一切可以挤出的人力，投入生产的第一线，大大加强了生产。仅从炊事人员和其他管理人员中就抽出了二十四人，投入麦田管理工作。生产队队长、副队长、党支部书记和团支部书记都直接兼任四个农田专业队队长，同社员一起劳动，分工包干领导各个专业队，既减少了层次节约了劳力，又使领导更加深入。各个专业队还实行了定额管理和奖励制度，社员的出勤率和劳动效率都比过去大大提高。
    八福村生产队的冲天干劲和巨大成就，极大地鼓舞了全公社和邻近各县的广大农民。这个队在3月初以亩产小麦一千五百斤的指标提出挑战后，全社八十四个生产队都热烈应战，广大社员决心“学八福，赶八福”，把麦田管理工作越作越细，一寸不让，争取实现小麦亩产双千斤社。蔡王村生产队和八福队一样，生产条件不好，他们在八福队提出挑战的第二天，就举行全队社员大会，修订指标，措施加码，保证今年的小麦亩产量要比去年提高四倍。半个多月来，社员们昼夜轮班苦战，风雨无阻，现在全部麦田又追肥和除草各一次，并且每亩地上了大量草木灰，以防止倒伏。许多社员每天向地里送粪三十多车，劳动效率比过去提高十倍。城关管理区各生产队除全部麦田都及时进行了施肥、灌水、除草等工作外，还专门给八百多亩三类麦田多施了十三万斤土化肥和人粪尿，三类苗连连升级，二类苗已和一类苗并驾齐驱。全管理区的六十眼半成品水井在几天内就全部修好，投入春灌，十二个土化肥厂的日产量已由七千斤提高到十一万斤。同样处于渭北旱原地区的韩城、邠县、乾县等县的公社和生产队，也纷纷向八福队应战，他们和蒲城县全体农民一起，展开了争夺渭北旱原地区小麦千斤县的红旗竞赛运动。韩城全县的八十四万亩麦田原计划亩产六百斤，社员们接到八福队的挑战书，立刻在全县展开“增指标，添措施，鼓干劲，争上游，破千斤，夺红旗”的竞赛运动，立誓今年实现小麦亩产千斤县。芝川公社涺丰管理区各个生产队苦战八昼夜，给四千八百多亩小麦施了追肥，水地全部进行了灌溉，全县不久前已积肥一百三十二亿斤，麦田追肥、春灌、除草等各项工作都进展神速。
