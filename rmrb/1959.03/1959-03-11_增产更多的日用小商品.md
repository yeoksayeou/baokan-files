Produce More Small Daily Commodities
Close Cooperation Between Industry and Commerce Departments
Large Increase in Small Commodities Production
    The industrial and commercial departments of Tianjin Municipality are closely cooperating to increase the production of small commodities to meet market needs. According to incomplete statistics, recently they can produce 4,000 dozens of pacifiers, and more than 1.47 million dozens of hair clips, collar hooks, trouser hooks, and shoe eyelets. In addition, pencil sharpeners, small cooking utensils, etc., are being produced in large quantities. The production of some small commodities has increased significantly compared to the original plan. For example, sewing machine needles have increased from 270,000 dozens to 360,000 dozens, and shoe polish has increased from 1.8 million boxes to 1.93 million boxes.

    In the process of increasing the production of small commodities, the workers of each factory are doing everything possible to open up sources of raw materials. They use the scraps and recycled waste materials from various large products to produce various small commodities. The No. 1 Hardware Wire Factory found enough short iron wires in the warehouse to weave 10,000 dustpans; the stoppers, kettle beams, and spouts of water scoops made by the Victory Hardware Products Factory are made entirely of scraps.

    Commercial departments are also devising various methods to help industrial departments solve raw material problems.

Step Up Production of Kettles and Spoons
    The No. 1 Enamel Factory of the Tianjin Municipal Handicraft Bureau is stepping up the production of enamel daily necessities to meet the needs of the people's lives.

    Recently, this factory has been shipping four to five thousand enamel kettles, black iron kettles, various water spoons, iron dustpans, etc., to retail departments in various districts of the city every day. The output of white iron kettles produced by this factory in January has exceeded the original annual production figure, and the quality has also improved compared to last year.

Battery Production Triples
    The newly built Changchun Battery Factory plans to produce 141,000 dozens of "Changchun" brand dry batteries (for flashlights) this year, a threefold increase over last year's actual output.

    In order to achieve this leap forward plan, they have successively created two key equipment: a core-making machine and a winding machine. In the past, zinc cylinders were only rolled with wooden sticks, which was very inefficient, and less than one could be rolled in a minute. Now, with the winding machine, thirty can be rolled in a minute. In the past, the core was hammered with wooden hammers, and a maximum of six hundred could be hammered a day. Now, with the core-making machine, more than a thousand pairs can be hammered a day.

Indigenous Methods Used to Make Light Bulbs
    The Taiyuan Electric Wire and Bulb Factory successfully trial-produced light bulbs using self-made wooden indigenous machines. In the first quarter, 10,000 light bulbs will be produced to supply the market. This newly built small factory

    did not have any machinery or equipment, so the workers used indigenous methods. They filled a kettle with gasoline and placed it in a basin of water to heat and steam it, replacing the gas engine to ignite; they repaired a broken blower that was not used in the canteen to replace the air compressor; and finally solved the major technical problems of manufacturing the horn tube and core pillar head installed in the light bulb. Other machines, such as the winding machine and the heading machine, are all made of wood.

### 增产更多的日用小商品

    增产更多的日用小商品
    工商业部门紧密协作
    小百货产量大增
    天津市工业、商业部门密切协作，增产小商品供应市场需要。据不完全统计，最近可生产出奶嘴四千打，发卡、领钩、裤钩、鞋眼等一百四十七万多打。此外正在大量生产的还有铅笔刀、小炊事用具等。有些小商品的生产比原计划增加了很多，如缝纫机针由原来的二十七万打增加到三十六万打，鞋油由一百八十万盒增加到一百九十三万盒。
    各厂职工在增产小商品当中，千方百计开辟原材料来源。他们利用各种大型产品的下脚剩料和回收的废旧物料，生产各种小商品。第一五金线厂从仓库里清理出的短铁丝，就足够编笊篱一万个；胜利五金制品厂做水舀把的堵头、壶梁、壶嘴完全是用下脚料做的。
    商业部门也想出各种办法帮助工业部门解决原材料问题。
    加紧生产壶和勺
    天津市手工业局第一搪瓷厂，加紧生产搪瓷日用品，供应人民生活需要。
    最近，这个厂每天要运出四、五千件搪瓷壶、黑铁壶、各种水勺、铁簸箕等，到市内各区门市部。这个厂，1月份生产的白铁壶已经超过了原定的全年生产数字，质量也比去年提高了。
    电池产量增三倍
    长春市新建长春电池厂，计划今年生产“长春”牌干电池（手电筒用）十四万一千打。比去年实际产量增长三倍。
    为实现这项跃进计划，他们接连创造出打芯机、卷筒机等两种关键性的设备。过去卷锌筒只用木棒来卷，效率很低，一分钟卷不了一个，现在使用卷筒机，一分钟可以卷三十个，过去打芯都是用木锤来打，一天最多打六百个，现在使用打芯机一天可以打到一千多双。
    土法上马制灯泡
    太原电线灯泡厂，自造木质土机器，试产电灯泡成功。第一季度内，将产出一万支电灯泡，供应市场。这个新建成的小工厂，
    还没有任何机器设备，职工们就用土法上马，把水壶内装上汽油，放在水盆内加火蒸气，代替煤气机发火；把食堂不用的坏吹风机修好，代替空气压缩机；终于解决了制造电灯泡内装的喇叭管、芯柱头等重大的技术问题。其他如：倒丝机上头机等都是木的。
