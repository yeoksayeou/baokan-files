Industrial and Commercial Collaboration, Production and Sales Combined
Wuhan Department Store System Twists Factories, Wholesale Stations, Retail Stores, and Warehouses into a Single Rope

(Our newspaper Wuhan, March 27th) The Wuhan Municipal Department Store System has organized a "one-dragon" collaboration of factories, wholesale stations, retail stores, warehouses, and the Xiaogan County Living Materials Management Department. The purpose of this "one-dragon" collaboration is to further strengthen the relationship between industry and commerce, urban and rural areas, wholesale stations, retail stores, and warehouses, twisting production, supply, and sales into a single rope, thereby promoting production and ensuring supply.

The units participating in this "one-dragon" collaboration include the Wuhan Chemical Plant, Wuhan Enamel Factory, Wuhan Match Factory, Wuhan Clothing Factory, Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station, Wuhan Central Department Store, Lifeng Store, Suifeng Warehouse, and Xiaogan County Living Materials Management Department, totaling nine industrial and commercial departments. These departments, through mobilizing the masses, and repeated discussions, proposed a total of one hundred and eleven collaboration conditions. These intersecting collaboration conditions have been determined after several discussions and have been formally signed in recent days. In addition, a "one-dragon" Collaboration Committee has been jointly formed to ensure the realization of the collaboration conditions.

Prior to this, the Wuhan Department Store System, led by the Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station, had proactively linked up with relevant factories based on the spirit of promoting production and ensuring supply, and carried out collaboration. From the beginning of this year to mid-March alone, the department store wholesale station system solved nearly seventy types of raw materials worth more than 1.1 million yuan for factories, and recovered various types of waste materials. Even the Wuhan Central Department Store has launched a waste material recycling business, organizing mobile purchasing teams to collect waste products everywhere. At the same time, many factories have also organized and arranged the production of fast-selling goods according to the opinions of the commercial departments to meet the needs of the market.

    本报武汉27日电　武汉市百货系统组织了工厂、批发站、零售店、仓库和孝感县生活资料经理部的“一条龙”大协作，这个“一条龙”大协作的目的是为了进一步密切工业和商业，城市和乡村，批发站、零售店和仓库之间的关系，把产供销拧成一股绳，从而促进生产，保证供应。
    参加这个“一条龙”大协作的单位计有武汉化工厂、武汉搪瓷厂、武汉火柴厂、武汉服装厂、武汉百货批发站、武汉中心百货商店，丽丰商店、穗丰仓库和孝感县生活资料经理部等九个工业和商业部门。这些部门通过发动群众，酝酿讨论，分别提出了总计一百一十一条协作条件。这些相互交错的协作条件经过多次商讨已经确定下来，并在最近正式签订协议。此外，还共同组成了“一条龙”协作委员会，以保证协作条件的实现。
    在此以前，以武汉百货批发站为首的武汉百货系统就根据促进生产、保证供应的精神，主动地与有关工厂挂钩，进行协作，从今年年初到3月中旬，仅百货批发站系统就为工厂解决了近七十种价值达一百一十多万元的原材料，并回收了各种各样的废旧物资；连武汉中心百货商店也开展了废旧物资回收的业务，组织流动收购队伍，到处回收废品。与此同时，许多工厂也根据商业部门的意见组织和安排了畅销商品的生产，以满足市场的需要。
