    Theatrical Troupe Goes to the Countryside
    The Sorbian people of the German Democratic Republic are a nationality that particularly loves theatrical art. In Bautzen, in the Sorbian region, there is a "Sorbian National Theatre." This uniquely styled theater is hard to find another like it in Democratic Germany. Although its "headquarters" are in the city, it often goes to the countryside to perform. They mostly use the village hotel's ballroom as a stage. The performance starts promptly at eight o'clock every night. Before the performance, the stage staff and actors depart in two buses, one after the other. While the stage staff are setting up the stage and the actors are putting on makeup, these two buses go to nearby villages to pick up the audience. After the show, the buses drop off the audience first, and then take the theater troupe back to the city. (Attached picture)

    艺术家下农村
    剧团下乡
    德意志民主共和国索布族是一个特别爱好戏剧艺术的民族。在索布族地区的保曾城有一个“索布族民族剧团”。这个有独特风格的剧团，在民主德国很难找到第二个。它的“大本营”虽然在城里，可是经常下乡演出。他们多半利用村中酒店的舞厅作舞台。每晚准八时开演。开演前，舞台工作人员和演员乘两辆公共汽车先后出发。在舞台工作人员布置舞台和演员化装时，这两辆公共汽车就到附近乡村去接观众。散场后，公共汽车先送走观众，然后再把剧团的人送回城里去。（附图片）
