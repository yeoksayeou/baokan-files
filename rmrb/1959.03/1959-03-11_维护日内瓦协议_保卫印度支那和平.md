    The American imperialists are stepping up the execution of their arrogant plans of aggression, seriously threatening peace in Indochina. Using Thailand and South Vietnam as bases, the United States attempts to completely control Laos, subvert the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and encircle the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in order to seize the entire Indochina Peninsula, threaten Southeast Asian countries that are peaceful and neutral, and press on China's southern border. The U.S. imperialist aggression of brazenly undermining the Geneva Accords, aggravating the tense situation in Indochina, and threatening peace and security in Southeast Asia has now become an increasingly serious problem.
    The United States has long harbored the intention to seize and control the Indochina Peninsula. As early as 1950, the United States attempted to intervene when France was in trouble suppressing the Indochinese national independence movement. However, this conspiracy was thwarted by the heroic struggle of the people of Indochina and the Geneva Accords signed in July 1954. The Geneva Accords restored peace to Indochina, and the countries participating in the agreement also undertook the obligation to guarantee respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and to guarantee non-interference in their internal affairs. At the same time, the signing of the Geneva Accords played a positive role in expanding the Asian peace zone and easing tensions in the Far East. This was a great victory for the people of Indochina and Asian countries and a serious defeat for Western colonialism and imperialism. The Geneva Accords received the resolute support of all socialist and all peace-loving countries and peoples. The governments of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan issued statements pointing out that these agreements were a remarkable contribution to the consolidation of peace in Southeast Asia and supported these agreements. Although the United States stated at the Geneva Conference that it would not use threats or force to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords, it cobbled together the aggressive "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" in September of the same year, arbitrarily including Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia within its so-called "protected area." Since then, the United States' ambition to covet Indochina has become increasingly blatant.
    For more than four years, U.S. imperialism has painstakingly attempted to reverse the trend of Indochina towards national independence, peace, and neutrality. It has never ceased its conspiracies to undermine the Geneva Accords and its aggression and interference in the countries of Indochina. The United States first intensified its aggression against South Vietnam, supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem clique as a tool to obstruct Vietnam's national reunification and further control Indochina. In the political sphere, with the support and instigation of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique not only stubbornly refused to hold North-South consultations and national general elections to realize the common desire of 25 million Vietnamese people to reunify their motherland, but also frantically persecuted former resistance personnel and patriotic people from all walks of life. The recently exposed Phu Loi incident, in which more than 1,000 political prisoners were poisoned, is a new example of a series of heinous crimes jointly planned by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. In the military sphere, the United States has also increasingly strengthened its interference and control over South Vietnam. The United States has established military bases in South Vietnam, and there are already nearly 2,000 U.S. military advisors in the Ngo Dinh Diem army. From December 3 to 24, 1958 alone, the United States imported 3,900 tons and more than 1,000 boxes of war materials into South Vietnam. Large numbers of U.S. and South Vietnamese military personnel have continuously entered the demilitarized zone armed, provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and creating tensions. Not only that, but the United States also ordered the South Vietnamese puppet regime to send so-called "observers" to participate in various meetings and military exercises of the Manila Group. All of these are in complete violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    Three years after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the Lao Patriotic Forces and the Royal Lao Government had reached a political agreement, and the Geneva Accords were being implemented. However, the United States instigated pro-American reactionary forces in Laos to increase pressure on the Lao government, demanding that the Lao government tear up the Geneva Accords and abandon its neutral policy. After Sananikone came to power in August 1958, he implemented a policy of relying on U.S. imperialism and openly abandoning the Geneva Accords, further persecuting patriotic democratic forces, undermining the political agreement on domestic peace and unity, and further placing Laos under the control of the United States militarily, politically, and economically. The United States increased its military aid to Laos, shipped in large quantities of new weapons, sent in Filipino U.S. Air Force personnel, built strategic highways and airports, and established U.S. military bases. For some time, Laos has intensified its military provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, creating border incidents, and using them as an excuse to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "aggression," while repeatedly rejecting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal to resolve border disputes through bilateral negotiations. This is clearly in response to the United States' aggressive activities throughout Indochina. When Laos loudly proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's "invasion" of the border in early January of this year, the U.S. propaganda machine gloatingly proclaimed: "As long as war breaks out in this area, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization can be put into action." Then, the Lao Army Chief of Staff, Ouane Rattikone, gave an interview to American reporters, requesting the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to send observers to Laos. On January 18, the Lao Ambassador to Thailand, Chao Khampan, even claimed that he would ask the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for assistance. On February 11, Lao Prime Minister Sananikone personally declared that he was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords. The next day, the U.S. State Department immediately came out to express its support, and said that from then on, the United States was free to establish a military mission in Laos. Recently, the Royal Lao Government openly dispatched "observers" to participate in the military exercises of the Southeast Asian aggressive group. So far, the U.S. conspiracy to use the Lao reactionary authorities to create tension in Indochina, tear up the Geneva Accords, and further drag Laos into the Southeast Asian military bloc has become clear to the world.
    The Royal Government of Cambodia has consistently abided by the Geneva Accords and adhered to a policy of peace and neutrality, making important contributions to maintaining peace in Indochina. However, U.S. imperialism, which is trying to seize the entire Indochina, is extremely dissatisfied with this. Since 1958, South Vietnamese troops have invaded Cambodian territory dozens of times; Thailand has also constantly provoked Cambodia; Cambodian rebel Son Ngoc Thanh has organized the "Free Khmer" armed group, plotting to take the opportunity to occupy border provinces and establish a "free government"; in January of this year, the Cambodian government cracked down on the treasonous group headed by Sam Sary, and in late February, it cracked down on the treason case of Keo Meas Suor, the commander of the Siem Reap Province military region. The relationship between all these acts of aggression, provocation, subversion, and sabotage and U.S. imperialism is well known. The Cambodian government and people have successively crushed conspiracies from outside and inside, safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of their country. However, U.S. imperialism is still doing everything possible to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Cambodia and undermine the policy of peace and neutrality of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
    The Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace in Indochina, the guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of the countries of Indochina, and an important link in the peaceful coexistence of Asian countries. From the day the Geneva Accords came into effect, the forces of peace launched a resolute struggle against the forces of imperialism. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Royal Government of Cambodia, and the patriotic and democratic forces of Laos have consistently made unremitting efforts to implement and maintain the Geneva Accords. They have received the support of the people of Indochina and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. The relevant international commissions have also made corresponding efforts. In contrast, the United States has consistently adopted a hostile, opposing, and destructive stance toward the Geneva Accords. It has used the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam and the powerful group in Thailand as pawns, colluding with the pro-American faction in Laos headed by Sananikone to control the political situation in Laos, and threatening and intimidating the Royal Government of Cambodia, attempting to push the entire Indochina onto the dangerous road of war. It must be pointed out that the current intensification of U.S. imperialism's interference and control over the countries of Indochina is closely related to and mutually echoes its activities of intensifying its policies of aggression and war in the entire Asian region. While announcing the separate signing of military agreements with Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey, further binding these countries to the U.S. chariot, the United States held a large-scale military exercise in Thailand, directed by the United States, aimed at intimidating the countries of Indochina and Southeast Asia. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, at the instigation of the United States, also harassed our country's Xisha Islands. The remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique active in Laos have also intensified their harassment and sabotage activities in the border areas of Yunnan Province, China. Therefore, it can be seen that the current conspiracy of interference and aggression by U.S. imperialism in Indochina, especially in Laos, is an important component of its overall creation of tension in Asia. It is clear that maintaining the Geneva Accords and preventing U.S. imperialism from seizing the entire Indochina is not only related to the peace and security of the people of Indochina, but also directly related to the peace and security of Southeast Asia and the entire Asian region.
    China is a participant in the Geneva Accords and has consistently been committed to maintaining the Geneva Accords. At the same time, the U.S. aggressive plan to seize the entire Indochina directly threatens China's security. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot but express legitimate concern about the serious situation currently emerging on the Indochinese Peninsula, especially in Laos. The Chinese government has issued a statement to this effect and has sent letters to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, requesting that the actions of the United States and Laos in undermining the Geneva Accords be stopped, and requesting that the International Commission for Laos continue its supervisory and monitoring activities. The Chinese people fully support the struggle of the people of Indochina to safeguard their independence and sovereignty and oppose foreign interference, and will never allow the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to control the entire Indochina and thus threaten the security of neighboring countries to succeed. The Geneva Accords must be maintained, and peace in Indochina must be defended. This is not only the unanimous demand of the people of Indochina, and the unavoidable responsibility of all countries concerned participating in the Geneva Conference, but also the urgent common task of all peace-loving and independent countries and peoples in Southeast Asia.

    维护日内瓦协议  保卫印度支那和平
    正在加紧执行的美帝国主义的狂妄的侵略计划，严重地威胁着印度支那的和平。美国以泰国和南越为基地，企图完全控制老挝，颠复柬埔寨王国政府，包围越南民主共和国，以便霸占整个印度支那半岛，威胁东南亚和平中立国家，并进逼中国的南部边疆。美帝国主义悍然破坏日内瓦协议、加剧印度支那紧张局势和威胁东南亚和平安全的侵略活动，现在已经成为越来越严重的问题了。
    美国蓄意霸占和控制印度支那半岛，由来已久。早在1950年，美国就企图乘法国在镇压印度支那民族独立运动陷入困境的时候，插手进去。可是这个阴谋却被印度支那各国人民的英勇斗争和1954年7月签订的日内瓦协议所遏阻了。日内瓦协议恢复了印度支那的和平，参加这个协议的国家还承担了保证尊重越南、老挝、柬埔寨的独立主权、统一和领土完整的义务，并且保证对它们的内政不予任何干涉。同时，日内瓦协议的签订，对扩大亚洲和平地区和缓和远东紧张局势，也起了积极的作用。这是印度支那和亚洲各国人民的巨大胜利，是西方殖民主义和帝国主义势力的严重失败。日内瓦协议得到了全体社会主义和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决支持。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦等国政府发表了声明，指出这些协议是对巩固东南亚和平的一个显著的贡献，并且支持这些协议。美国尽管在日内瓦会议上声明不使用威胁或武力来妨碍日内瓦协议的执行，但在同年9月间却拼凑了侵略性的“东南亚条约组织”，擅自把越南、老挝和柬埔寨列入它的所谓“保护地区”之内。此后美国觊觎印度支那的野心日益露骨。
    四年多以来，美帝国主义处心积虑地企图扭转印度支那各国向着民族独立与和平中立发展的方向。它一天也没有停止过对日内瓦协议的破坏阴谋以及对印度支那各国的侵略和干涉。美国首先加紧了对南越的侵略活动，扶植吴庭艳集团，作为阻挠越南实现全国统一和进一步控制印度支那的工具。在政治方面，由于美国的支持和指使，吴庭艳集团不仅横蛮地拒绝南北协商，举行全国普选，以实现二千五百万越南人民统一祖国的共同愿望，而且疯狂迫害前抗战人员和各阶层爱国人民。不久以前被揭发出来的一次毒杀一千多名政治犯的富利事件，是美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团共同策划的一系列滔天罪行的新例证。在军事方面，美国也日益加强了对南越的干涉和控制。美国在南越已经建立了军事基地，在吴庭艳军队里已经有近两千名的美军顾问。仅在1958年12月3日到24日，美国就输入南越三千九百吨和一千多箱的战争物资。大批美国和南越的军事人员，不断武装进入非军事区，向越南民主共和国进行挑衅和制造紧张局势。不仅如此，美国还命令南越傀儡政权派遣所谓“观察员”参加马尼拉集团的各种会议和军事演习。所有这些，都是完全违背日内瓦协议的规定的。
    老挝在日内瓦协议签字三年以后，寮国战斗部队同老挝王国政府本来已经达成政治协议，日内瓦协议正在实施过程中。但是，美国却策动老挝的亲美反动势力，对老挝政府加强压力，要求老挝政府撕毁日内瓦协议，放弃中立政策。1958年8月萨纳尼空上台以后，执行了投靠美帝国主义和公然背弃日内瓦协议的政策，进一步迫害爱国民主力量，破坏国内和平团结的政治协议，并且使老挝在军事、政治和经济上，进一步处于美国的控制之下。美国增加了对老挝的军事援助，运入大批新武器，派去了菲籍美国空军人员，修筑战略公路和飞机场，建立美国的军事基地。若干时期以来，老挝加紧了对越南民主共和国的军事挑衅，制造边境事件，并以之为借口，大肆诬蔑越南民主共和国进行“侵略”，而又一再拒绝越南民主共和国提出的通过双方谈判解决边境纠纷的建议。这显然是同美国在整个印度支那的侵略活动相呼应的。今年1月上旬，老挝大事宣扬越南民主共和国“侵入”边境的时候，美国的宣传机器就得意忘形地扬言：“这个地区只要一发生战事，就可以使东南亚条约组织采取行动。”接着，老挝的陆军参谋长拉提曲耳就对美国记者发表谈话，要求东南亚条约组织派遣观察员到老挝去。1月18日老挝驻泰国大使赵康潘更声称要请求东南亚条约组织给予援助。2月11日，老挝首相萨纳尼空亲自出马，声明不再受日内瓦协议的约束。第二天，美国国务院立刻出来表示支持，并且说，从此美国可以自由地在老挝设立一个军事使团。最近老挝王国政府公然奉命派遣“观察员”参加了东南亚侵略集团的军事演习。至此，美国利用老挝反动当局制造印度支那紧张局势，撕毁日内瓦协议，并进一步把老挝拉入东南亚军事集团的阴谋，就大白于天下了。
    柬埔寨王国政府一贯遵守日内瓦协议，坚持和平中立政策，对维护印度支那和平作出了重要的贡献。然而，力图霸占整个印度支那的美帝国主义却对此极为不满。1958年以来，南越军队侵扰柬埔寨国境达几十次；泰国也向柬埔寨不断挑衅；柬埔寨叛逆分子山玉成组织了“自由高棉”武装集团，阴谋伺机占领边境省份，成立“自由政府”；今年1月，柬埔寨政府破获了以桑·萨里为首的叛国集团，2月下旬又破获了暹粒省军区司令琼·莫舒皮的叛国案。所有这些侵略挑衅行动和颠复破坏活动，同美帝国主义之间的关系，是尽人皆知的。柬埔寨政府和人民先后粉碎了来自外部和内部的阴谋策划，维护了自己国家的独立主权。但是美帝国主义仍在千方百计地阻挠日内瓦协议在柬埔寨的实施，破坏柬埔寨王国政府的和平中立政策。
    日内瓦协议是印度支那和平的基础，是印度支那各国的独立和主权的保证，是亚洲各国和平共处的重要环节。自从日内瓦协议开始生效的一天起，和平力量就同帝国主义力量展开了坚决的斗争。越南民主共和国政府、柬埔寨王国政府和老挝的爱国民主力量一贯地为实施和维护日内瓦协议而进行了不懈的努力。他们得到了印度支那各国人民以及爱好和平的亚洲和全世界人民的支持。有关的国际委员会也作了相应的努力。与此相反，美国则一贯地采取了敌视、反对和破坏日内瓦协议的立场，它利用南越吴庭艳集团和泰国的有势力集团为爪牙，勾结以萨纳尼空为首的老挝亲美派来控制老挝政局，向柬埔寨王国政府进行威胁恫吓，企图把整个印度支那推向危险的战争的道路。必须指出，目前美帝国主义所以加紧干涉和控制印度支那各国的活动，是同它在整个亚洲地区加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策的活动密切相关的，而且是互相呼应的。美国在宣布同巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其分别签订军事协定，进一步把这些国家缚到美国战车上的同时，在泰国举行了由美国指挥的、旨在恫吓印度支那和东南亚各国的大规模军事演习。吴庭艳集团并在美国的唆使下向我国的西沙群岛进行骚扰。活动在老挝境内的蒋介石集团的残余武装也加紧了向我国云南省边境地区的骚扰破坏活动。因此，可以看出，美帝国主义目前在印度支那特别是在老挝所进行的干涉和侵略阴谋，是它在亚洲全面制造紧张局势的一个重要组成部分。很明显，维护日内瓦协议，制止美帝国主义妄图霸占整个印度支那的侵略活动，不但关系着印度支那各国人民的和平与安全，而且也直接关系着东南亚以及整个亚洲地区的和平与安全。
    中国是日内瓦协议的参加国，一贯致力于维护日内瓦协议。同时，美国企图霸占整个印度支那半岛的侵略计划，又直接威胁到中国的安全。因此，中国人民对于目前印度支那半岛上特别是在老挝出现的严重局势，不能不表示正当的关切。中国政府已为此发表声明，并且致函日内瓦会议两主席，要求制止美国和老挝破坏日内瓦协议的行动，要求老挝国际委员会继续进行监督和监察的活动。中国人民完全支持印度支那各国人民维护独立主权和反对外国干涉的斗争，决不容许美帝国主义企图控制整个印度支那并进而威胁邻国安全的阴谋得逞。日内瓦协议必须维护，印度支那和平必须保卫。这不仅是印度支那各国人民的一致要求，是参加日内瓦会议有关各国的不可逃避的责任，而且是东南亚所有爱好和平独立的国家和人民刻不容缓的共同任务。
