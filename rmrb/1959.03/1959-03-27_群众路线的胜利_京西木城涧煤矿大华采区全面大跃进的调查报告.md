    The Victory of the Mass Line
    —An Investigation Report on the Comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Dahua Mining Area of the Muchenjian Coal Mine in Western Beijing
    Fu Dong, Zhu Lirong, Yuan Ding, Mo Ai
    Old contradictions have just disappeared, and new contradictions are born again. Things move and develop in contradictions. The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Dahua Mining Area of the Muchenjian Coal Mine in Western Beijing is a reflection of this objective law. In the great mass movement, this mining area constantly exposes contradictions, allowing the masses to understand them, grasp them, and then solve them; moreover, as soon as one subject is completed, another subject uses typical examples to send out moving calls to the people. New things from the masses, after the leadership and organization of the Party, quickly become a bright red banner, guiding the workers of the entire mining area to continuously leap forward in the long-distance race of developing productive forces.
    In 1958, this mining area took a big step forward in the Great Leap Forward. Under the conditions of reduced personnel and no increase in equipment, coal production increased from more than 270,000 tons in 1957 to more than 450,000 tons. Except for the two indicators of quality and recovery rate, which were slightly worse, all other indicators ranked among the best in the mines under the jurisdiction of the Beijing West Mining Bureau: full-member efficiency—1.92 tons of coal per worker per day, cost—6.6518 yuan per ton of coal, safe production—no deaths throughout the year, one serious injury, and minor injuries reduced by more than half compared with 1957. It is a red flag among the mines under the jurisdiction of the Beijing West Mining Bureau.
    “Civilized Work Site” Opens the Door to the Leap Forward
    How was the vigorous Great Leap Forward formed? When the miners recalled this question, they believed that 1956 was their "year of raising their heads," 1957 was their "year of standing up," and "with heads raised and standing up, 1958 was the Great Leap Forward!" It turns out that this coal mining area covered by a barren mountain—a medium-sized steeply inclined thick coal seam mine—was built in the winter of 1951. In the first two or three years, it was completely mined by hand and transported by manpower pushcarts; in 1954, some mechanical equipment such as pneumatic picks and electric drills were added, and coal was transported by horse-drawn carts. During this period, due to the small base number of coal production, the growth rate was still fast, and the annual coal production increased exponentially: more than 30,000 tons of coal were produced in 1952, rising to more than 140,000 tons in 1954.
    In the following years, although equipment and manpower increased every year, the growth rate of coal production was very slow. In 1955 and 1956, it only increased by 15,000 tons and 40,000 tons respectively.
    The chaotic situation underground was a major reason that affected the improvement of production efficiency at that time. Because the coal quality was loose, in the roadways, the coal above desperately pressed down, the coal below vigorously bulged upwards, and the coal on both sides squeezed outwards. As a result, some newly built sheds were crushed and twisted after only four or five days, becoming narrow and short, and more than 100 repair workers could not repair them all day long. Workers often had to crawl in and out of the roadways. Both sides of the roadways were littered with waste pit wood and stones. Sometimes, a nail would puncture the feet of two or three people in a row, and no one would care.
    At the end of 1956, under the guidance of the higher-level Party committee, the workers of the second recovery team started the "civilized work site." They cleaned up the mine every day after work before leaving. Many old workers had suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society, and many of their partners were killed by coal and stones. The current working environment is very different from the past, but small accidents still occur from time to time. They strongly agree with the "civilized work site." But some people objected, saying, "Since ancient times, coal mines have not been clean. How can a latrine not be smelly?" "Who pays for the civilized work site?" The leadership mobilized everyone to discuss: "Is the civilized work site good or not?" "Who is safe production for?" As a result of the discussion, the vast majority of people agreed, and only a few people's thinking was not completely clear. At that time, wages were calculated on a piecework basis, and the "civilized work site" was not piecework, so money was playing tricks in some people's minds. After repeated explanations by the leadership that current interests must be subordinate to long-term interests and individual interests must be subordinate to national interests, the workers' thinking was basically unified.
    After the second team did this for a period of time, there were no work-related injuries in the whole team. The leadership consciously praised them. Some people in other teams didn't believe it and didn't accept it. The leadership organized them to visit the second team. Sure enough, there was not a single broken beam or broken column, and people could move freely in and out of the coal roadway without getting so tired. After many visits, debates, and comparisons, the "civilized work site" was launched in the entire mining area.
    After the implementation of the "civilized work site," the workers were happy to work, and safety was more guaranteed than before. According to statistics, one year after the implementation, accidents were reduced by half, output increased by one-fifth, and pit wood was saved by one-tenth. And the more important gain was that it opened the door to the leap forward. The cadres began to realize that as long as they rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to do it, even the biggest problems can be solved successfully.
    The Storm of Implementing "Team Acceptance"
    After a period of time, some people slackened off again. When workers took over shifts, they found that the work site handed over by the previous shift was not as clean as before, and the quality of the project was not good. When they raised objections to the other party, the other party would either present objective difficulties or glare at them, saying, "The inspector has accepted it. What's it to you?" This made the two shifts of workers disunited.
    In this way, the problem developed from the acceptance of the "civilized work site" to the problem of project acceptance. At that time, the inspectors checked the quality of the project. The inspectors' technical level was not high, and there were too many work sites to inspect. If the work done was not up to standard, the next shift had to redo it. As a result, the country spent more money and affected coal production.
    The old worker Cui Yusheng felt distressed and suggested that the leadership hand over the acceptance work to the masses for management, and let the next shift's team leader and workers accept the "civilized work site" of the previous shift, and at the same time accept the quantity and quality of the project.
    How to ensure the quality of underground projects was one of the important issues the leadership was considering at that time. If this problem was not solved, production could not be increased, and the "civilized work site" could not be consolidated. Cui Yusheng's suggestion happened to solve this contradiction, so it was given a name called "Team Acceptance" and decided to promote it universally in the mining area.
    When it was first implemented, some workers demanded too much quality and often refused to sign for the work done by the previous shift. Many people worked hard all day and didn't get a penny. They said, "This is simply workers controlling workers," and the reaction was great.
    Could this method be implemented? Some people were hesitant. After the higher-level Party committee learned about it, it pointed out that this was a good form of mass participation in management and should be adhered to, but it should not be let go. A specific analysis should be made of the current situation and problems. The Party organization of this mining area went down to investigate and found out that the reason for the deviation was mainly that the ideological work was not done well enough, the methods were not explained in detail, and the Party lacked leadership in this matter. The workers' serious acceptance was a manifestation of their being masters of their own affairs and being responsible, and should be supported, but attention should also be paid to two situations: one is that the technical level of many workers is indeed not high, and the other is that some workers' requirements for acceptance are inappropriate, and there is a phenomenon of mutual non-acceptance. The Party General Branch immediately held a series of symposiums with Party members, team leaders, and old workers, and the problem was put on the table for discussion, and it became clear. The workers all believed that improving the quality of underground projects was an important issue in current production and could not be sloppy. However, clear acceptance specifications and standards should be formulated. The leadership accepted the workers' opinions and also stipulated that if unqualified projects were found, not only should the problem be raised, but also the reasons and solutions should be pointed out, so that the workers of the previous shift would know their shortcomings and improve. In order to conduct team acceptance with leadership, it was also stipulated that if the acceptance and the accepted teams had different opinions, then the section chief would be the main person to absorb old workers and the two team leaders to form an inspection team for identification.
    The workers were very satisfied after doing this. They said, "If we check ourselves, we have to be responsible and can't just watch the country's money being thrown away." It can be seen from the statistics one year later: output increased by 72.5%, accidents decreased by 90%, pit wood was saved by 27.3%, and costs decreased by 44.5% (of course, these achievements are also related to the "engineering deployment briefing" that was carried out later). But more importantly, the technical level of many workers has improved with the strict acceptance of the teams. For example, the sheds built by Tang Zizhuang, a worker in the fifth team, failed the acceptance twice. The reasons and methods were pointed out to him during the acceptance. Later, the sheds he made all met the specifications. The cadres gained even more. When they talked about "team acceptance," they always said that this incident helped us learn another experience: to do anything, we must not only believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and let go of mobilizing the masses, but also go to the masses to lead the masses.
    A Good Form of Three Combinations—"Engineering Deployment Briefing"
    Soon, two things happened in a row in the mining area: a place in the 402 South Groove collapsed, and the 428 Big Groove also encountered the same situation. Why is this? The workers said, "We are like abacus beads. We go wherever the leadership dials us. We don't understand the situation and don't know what's going on. We can't be blamed!" What about the leadership? They were busy all day long. This section chief ran over and said, "There is no work site. The masses are asking the team leader for tasks. The team leader is urging me, so I have to ask the above for it." That section chief said, "The plan does not completely conform to reality. After going down the mine, a new recovery working face was opened, and the original equipment and tools are not enough. The workers are stopping work and waiting for tools. Please the leadership to think of a solution."
    What to do? Sitting in the office all day cannot solve the problem! Why not hand over the engineering deployment to the masses to come up with ideas? Wasn't the team acceptance system proposed by the masses? Isn't that a good way to solve the problem!
    They came up with a method of engineering deployment briefing: the production plan and engineering deployment for each year, season, and month are discussed and formulated by the leading cadres, then handed over to the workers at each level for discussion, supplementation, and modification, and finally implemented after being approved by the leadership.
    The workers were very happy. They said that now they are as clear as a mirror, and they know clearly how much they do every day, where they do it, and what method they use. They don't have to temporarily assign tasks after going down the mine like before. The workers are very active. They hold a 15-minute "construction meeting" before going to work every day to clarify the tasks before going down the mine. Because they know what's going on, they calculate efficiency and costs in everything. If they encounter problems that they have the right to solve, they will think of ways to solve them themselves. Team leaders Liu Laiquan and Liu Junxing saw a pond that had been opened in the past in the 428 East No. 1 Stone Gate. Based on their experience, they judged that there was still coal inside, so they suggested that the leadership open a slope and go back to the pond from the south. After the leadership approved and implemented it, they mined coal for two more weeks.
    After doing this, production increased day by day, and the leadership was very happy. They said that now they don't have to turn around in the office all day long. The places that the leadership didn't think of carefully were all brought up by the masses. The leadership can often go down the mine to check the work, and the work is more proactive. The team leaders and workers are also very happy. They said that after the engineering deployment briefing, their minds were liberated, and they took the initiative to solve problems within their scope of authority. Not long after the implementation, many workers have learned to draw engineering sketches, and their technical skills have improved.
    "It is right to follow the mass line!" Faced with a series of facts, the cadres firmly believed in this truth.
    The Unity of Political Work and Material Interests—"Labor Cards"
    In October last year, the entire mining area changed from a piecework wage system to a time wage system. In the first two months, everyone was motivated, and the tasks were completed well. By December, the situation began to change. The square excavation and repair work on the recovery working face could not be completed according to the plan. Everyone was willing to go to the recovery. The coal recovered had a number, and the results were written on the books, which everyone could see. When individual team leaders inspected, they saw that some sheds were not qualified, but they did not actively raise objections. They thought, "Whether I do a good job or a bad job, I get so much money, why offend people!"
    This won't work! The workers said that we have to think of a way, otherwise who does a good job, who does a bad job, who has what advantages, who has what disadvantages, everyone doesn't know, there is no supervision, so how can we move forward!
    The old worker Bi Wenming lay in bed at night thinking: What method can I think of that can make the national plan completed well and allow my workmates to move forward?
    How about a personal plan? Before going down the mine every day, everyone talks about their personal plan, how much they want to complete today, check how much they actually completed when they finish work, and register the results on the labor card, so that everyone knows who is not working hard, and it can be discussed at the team's life meeting. Those who complete it well should be praised and encouraged to be more advanced.
    Bi Wenming thought for more than ten days, had some ideas in his mind, and told the leadership his ideas.
    After changing the piecework wage to the time wage, finding a form to promote the enthusiasm of the workers is an extremely important issue. The labor registration method provided by Bi Wenming is not only educational for the workers politically, but also can be used as a reference for future awards and ratings. This is a good method. The leadership supported his initiative and asked their group to hold a meeting to discuss it. At the meeting, everyone said in unison: "Yes! Let's do it this way. Who doesn't want to be criticized all the time!"
    How much quota, now everyone has no worries. In the past, when the piecework wage system was implemented, if we did too much, we were afraid of raising the quota. Now we can openly propose it. The repair workers said that the quota for the sheds they supported in the main roadway can be changed from three or five to the ten to fifteen that have already been reached. The tunneling workers said that in the past, they tunneled 1.8 meters a day, and now they can tunnel 2 meters or 2.5 meters. Everyone is willing to be at the forefront.
    The method proposed by Bi Wenming was quickly promoted in the entire mining area. The workers reported their quotas based on past production conditions and democratic evaluation. In addition to holding a 15-minute "construction meeting" before going to work, they also held a 15-minute "closing meeting" after work. At the "closing meeting," the team leader registered everyone's workload on the card and reported it to the workers one by one. These reports became the main materials for discussion at the weekly life meeting: who worked well, who did not work well, why it was good, why it was not good, and how to improve. The workers helped and encouraged each other at the meeting.
    After the implementation in January this year, the results were obvious in only one month: compared with August last year, output increased by 30.5%, accidents decreased by 80%, and costs decreased by 18.2%.
    Workers who were once behind in production have also caught up to the front. For example, the tunneling square excavation workers in the fourth team tunneled 0.926 meters per worker in September last year when the piecework wage system was implemented. After changing to the time wage, they only tunneled 0.3 meters per worker in December, and the efficiency decreased by two-thirds. After the implementation of personal labor registration in January this year, they tunneled 1.006 meters, which was much better than when the piecework wage system was implemented.
    The time wage plus the "labor card," and using the record of the "labor card" as a reference for awards and ratings, unites the political work for the workers with the material interests of the workers.
    Found a New Way to Develop Productive Forces
    From carrying out "civilized work sites," "team acceptance," and "engineering briefings" to implementing "personal labor cards," each link is closely linked to the previous one. The emergence and formation of each link leads the mass movement to deepen, and the production level takes a big step forward. The coal production in this mining area in the first half of 1957 was more than 130,000 tons, while the coal production in the first half of 1958 quickly rose to more than 190,000 tons. However, has the production potential been exhausted? No! A series of innovations and victories have encouraged cadres and the masses to continue to seek new ways to develop productive forces. After hearing about the experience of organizing high production on one working face at an advancement conference convened by the higher Party committee, some new ideas immediately emerged in their minds: Is the production organization of this mining area satisfactory? In the mine, why are there still phenomena of people and equipment being idle...? An important feature that distinguishes the coal industry from many other industries is that it is less constrained by equipment, raw materials, etc., and the role of people is particularly large. If the efficiency of one person is increased, a lot more coal can be produced. It can be said that "where there are people, there is coal." Therefore, giving full play to the potential of each production worker and improving their labor productivity has become a key issue in carrying out the bumper harvest movement in the coal industry.
    They decided to adjust the labor organization through carrying out a large-scale bumper harvest movement and comprehensively drive the production management work under the goal of improving labor productivity.
    The pilot work quickly started in the fourth team, then the first team, and then the sixth team. In the past, these three teams were scattered on three working faces, each 60 meters long. Now, after these three teams have completed the mining tasks of each team's working face, they have successively concentrated their manpower together and comprehensively arranged it on a 120-meter-long working face and transportation road. According to the requirements of regular operations, they have step-by-step and orderly started to fight the coal seam on a working face that has been greatly widened compared to before. The workers said: Now they can "swing their arms and do it." Their enthusiasm is even higher. The transportation workers challenged the recovery workers, saying: "If the coal that is mined cannot be transported out, we will make a self-criticism. If there is no coal for us to transport, you will be responsible!" The recovery workers said: "We guarantee that you will not be idle, and your legs and waist will be sore!" Three transportation workers did the work of five people, saving two people to mine coal. An Zhengde and Gao Jingren, who were respectively recovering wooden pillars on the north and south slopes, both wanted to recover the wooden pillars first so that they could preemptively use the electric drill to mine more coal. As a result, An Zhengde had just gotten the electric drill, and Gao Jingren also got the cable in time. The electric drill and cable were not compatible, and neither could use it. In the past, these two young men would not have given in to each other. However, on this day, Gao Jingren sent the cable to the south slope and installed it on An Zhengde's electric drill, and helped him punch holes in the coal seam. Then An Zhengde also went to the north slope and worked with Gao Jingren.
    This reform in production has pushed the production level to a new height: first, after the mining face is widened, the advanced coal mining method under the conditions of steeply inclined thick coal seams—the multi-pond recovery method—has been further developed in production, and coal production can be significantly increased as a result; second, the coal mining speed is accelerated, and the roadway maintenance time is correspondingly shortened, and the pit wood, maintenance workers, and other maintenance costs consumed in this area can be greatly reduced; third, and more importantly, after the labor force is concentrated and used, in addition to greatly improving the labor efficiency of each worker under reasonable deployment, a batch of manpower can also be saved. The number of people going down the mine in these three teams before the reform (January to June 1958) was 107, and after the reform it was 93. If the adjustment is more reasonable, it is possible to save more manpower. In addition, one-third of the electric drills, cables, and other mechanical equipment have been saved, and management work is also more convenient than before. The following table is a comparison of several major indicators of these three teams before the reform (January to June 1958) and after the formal reform (September 1958 to February 1959):
    The workers of the fourth team blew the号角 for a greater leap forward: The ideal experiment of large-scale bumper harvest was successful, and the greater leap forward started. From March, the entire mining area decided to completely eliminate the working faces with output below 10,000 tons. After resolutely completing the national plan of 700,000 tons of coal annual output, it will increase the production of 50,000 tons of coal for the country! That is to say, this year each employee must produce an average of 3.58 tons of coal for the country every day, which is 203% higher than in 1957 and 84% higher than in 1958.
        People are the Decisive Factor in Achieving the Great Leap Forward
    Compared with 1957, the other conditions in 1958 were basically the same except that the development tasks were less than in 1957. Why was the production level so different in these two years?
    It is people who have played a role, people's thinking has changed, the Party's leadership level has improved, and cadres can connect with the masses. And all this is closely linked to the national rectification movement.
    Two-thirds of the 743 employees in the entire mining area are old miners from before liberation, and they are the backbone of this mining area. They are the most enthusiastic in the Great Leap Forward, and they are also the ones who have put forward many important suggestions. They are highly conscious, have good technology, and are encouraged by the national Great Leap Forward situation in recent years. They have liberated their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. They have played a great role in production and in previous movements. Among them, there are also a few old miners who still have the scattered state of the "small kiln" period in the past. They also have a conservative side. For example, it was not easy to accept new things like the "civilized work site" at the beginning, but as long as the Party organization explained it, their views gradually changed. In addition, the vast majority of the other one-third of the employees are also good workers. Under the influence and help of the old miners, especially after the rectification movement, their class consciousness has also greatly improved. The following table is a statistic of the class consciousness of all employees before and after the rectification movement:
    This group of old workers with class consciousness is an important foundation for the Great Leap Forward in this mining area last year. However, when the workers analyzed the general reasons for the Great Leap Forward, they all said in unison that it was the result of the Party's correct leadership and the rectification movement.
    The Party General Branch of this mining area has a total of seven members. In addition to the secretary, who was originally a local cadre, the administrative leading cadres, the chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, and other members are all from miner backgrounds. They all humbly said that their education is low, their theory is poor, and their work experience is not much, but they have a common characteristic: they have close ties with the workers and have a deep understanding of the workers' thoughts and feelings. In addition, with the timely and specific leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the Party General Branch Committee has done very well in the following three aspects:
    First, come from the masses and go to the masses. Some major reforms carried out in the past one or two years have mostly come directly from the suggestions of the masses, or have been adopted under the inspiration of the masses' creation. Some are the intentions of the higher levels, but they are often universally promoted among the masses after typical experiments so that the masses have practical perceptual knowledge.
    Second, the political and ideological work is grasped tightly and well. There are regular criticisms and self-criticisms within the Party. As soon as wrong ideas raise their heads, the Party organization discusses them. The production performance of Liu Laiquan's team in the fourth team was relatively good, so the Party member and deputy team leader Tang Fengtong believed that his team was remarkable and that "other teams could not catch up." Under the control of this emotion, the attendance rate in the team was very poor, while the other two teams quietly caught up. The Party General Branch immediately conducted an inspection among the cadres on the topic of opposing pride and complacency. With the help of the Party, Tang Fengtong corrected his understanding, and soon the production of the whole team caught up again. One day, a worker criticized the leading cadres of individual sections of the mining area for lacking the thinking of "one game of chess" at the meeting, using the relationship between "general" and "chariot" in chess. He compared the leaders of the mining area to the "general," saying that he could only move in the grids where the "general" moves, while individual assistants in the section were like a "chariot," arbitrarily walking horizontally and vertically without taking care of the overall situation. Based on this reflection of the masses and combined with some problems existing in the thinking of the cadres, the Party General Branch immediately conducted an inspection and criticism of localism among Party members. Many wrong ideas and tendencies dissipated when they were "about to form clouds but did not rain."
    Third, there are some very good organizations and systems among the masses to ensure that the Party's political and ideological leadership is implemented among the masses. The various grassroots organizations in this mining area—production teams—have established core groups led by Party members, with team leaders, old workers, and activists participating. All the production, business, and technical issues of the whole team and the ideological education of the employees are first brewed in this group, and then separately submitted to the workers' congress of the whole team or the weekly life meeting for discussion. At the meeting, workers commend good people and good deeds. When they encounter people who are not motivated enough or have wrong ideological styles, they frankly help him expose his mistakes, point out the direction, and actively and consistently help him improve according to the principle of unity-criticism-unity. This kind of organization and system makes the upright spirit flourish, evil spirits cannot raise their heads, and the Party's policies are firmly implemented.
    However, all of this is inseparable from the style of the cadres. The main characteristics of the cadres' style are that they mingle with the masses, do not put on airs, can discuss everything with the masses, and take the lead in doing it themselves. When the workers are fighting hard underground, the leaders also sweat and dig coal and push carts with them. When the masses make mistakes or are ideologically depressed, the leaders will appear by their side, patiently persuading and educating them. Even if a couple or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarrel and fight, the leaders will come to persuade them. No matter how big the matter is, after the leaders say a few words and persuade them a few times, the dark clouds will dissipate. The workers said: "The leaders know us better than our relatives, and they are closer to us than our relatives."
    There are only 29 cadres who are detached from production in the entire mining area, accounting for less than 4% of the total number of employees. With fewer cadres, things are handled very quickly. Once the Party organization has studied and decided, the cadres of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League will go to handle them separately. One policy, all acting together, can be implemented to the end at once.
    These good styles are like a bridge, linking the Party's thoughts with the masses' thoughts.
    The Victory of the Party's Mass Line
    The experience of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Dahua Mining Area is very rich. It clearly points out that in the Great Leap Forward, timely discovering and summarizing the problems and experiences of the masses in production practice, discovering, mastering, and solving the contradictions raised in practice is a central link in promoting and organizing the masses to continuously leap forward. But to do this, we must, on the basis of giving prominence to politics, first educate cadres to establish the viewpoint of believing in the masses in their thinking, adhere to the mass line in their working methods, and mingle with the masses in their lifestyle. Under the specific leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the Party organization of the Dahua Mining Area has grasped this chain, so in the great mass movement, it can timely discover new contradictions, propose appropriate solutions, and push production to new heights.
    The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the Dahua Mining Area proves the victory of the Party's mass line.
    Of course, things always gradually go from superficial to in-depth, and from incomplete to complete. Although the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the Dahua Mining Area is rich, it is still superficial and incomplete. To go to in-depth and complete, it remains to be rectified, consolidated, and improved, and remains to be re-practiced and re-enriched by the masses. It must also be seen that although the achievements of this mining area in the process of the Great Leap Forward are great, there are still some weaknesses that can be avoided, such as the fact that production preparation work is sometimes not done well enough. Especially important is that the leap forward plan for 1959 is very large, but the measures have not been fully implemented, and the plan cannot be completed on a ten-day, daily, or shift basis. These are all specific problems. As long as they are grasped conscientiously and implemented, difficulties will be overcome, and problems will be quickly solved.
    With a team of workers with a high degree of class consciousness, with cadres who can closely contact the masses, with rich experience in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, with a material foundation and spiritual conditions that cannot be compared with any previous year, it can be believed that with the active efforts of the employees, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward can be expected in the near future.

    群众路线的胜利
    ——京西木城涧煤矿大华采区全面大跃进的调查报告
    傅冬　朱立荣　袁丁　莫艾
    旧的矛盾刚刚消失，新的矛盾又诞生了，事物在矛盾中运动着和发展着。京西木城涧煤矿大华采区的全面大跃进，正是这个客观规律的反映。这个采区在伟大的群众运动中，不断揭露矛盾，让群众认识它，掌握它，进而解决它；而且是，一个课题刚刚结束，另一个课题又通过典型实例在向人们发出动人的召唤了。来自群众的新事物，经过党的领导和组织，就很快成为一面鲜明的红旗，在发展生产力的长跑中，引导着全采区的职工不断向前跃进。
    1958年，这个采区跃进的步子是很大的，在人员减少、设备没有增加什么的条件下，煤产量由1957年的二十七万多吨上升到四十五万多吨。除质量、回采率两项指标稍差外，其余各项指标在京西矿务局所属各矿中，都名列前茅：全员效率——每工每天产煤一点九二吨，成本——每吨煤为六点六五一八元，安全生产——全年无死亡事故，重伤事故一人，轻伤事故比1957年减少一半以上。它是京西矿务局所属各矿中的一面红旗。
    “文明活地”打开了跃进的大门
    轰轰烈烈的大跃进是怎样形成的？矿工们在回忆这个问题的时候，认为1956年是他们的“抬头年”，1957年是“起身年”，“抬头了，起身了，1958年就大跃进了！”原来，这个复盖在一片荒山下的采煤区——中型急倾斜厚煤层矿井，是1951年冬建成的。最初两三年完全用手工开采，人力推车；1954年增添了一部分风锤、电钻等机械设备，同时改用马拉车运煤。在这期间，由于煤产量的基数小，因此增长速度还快，每年的煤产量都成倍地上升：1952年产煤三万多吨，到1954年上升为十四万多吨。
  以后几年虽然设备和人力都年有增加，但是煤产量的增长速度却很慢，1955年和1956年只分别增长了一万五千吨和四万吨。
    井下的杂乱状况，是当时影响生产效率提高的一个主要原因。由于煤质酥松，巷道中，上头的煤拼命往下压，底下的煤一股劲向上凸，两壁煤则向外乱挤，因此，有些新架的棚子，才过四、五天，就被压得七扭八歪，又窄又矮，每天一百多个修护工修都修不过来。工人进出巷道常常得爬着走。巷道两旁扔满了废坑木、石头，有时，一个钉子接连扎坏两三个人的脚也没人理睬。
    1956年底，在上级党委的指导下，回采二组的工人搞起“文明活地”来了。他们每天下班后把矿井里打扫干净才走。许多老工人过去在旧社会受尽折磨，他们的伙伴有很多就是被煤、石砸死的，现在的劳动环境和从前大不一样了，但是磕手碰脚的小事故还不断发生。他们非常赞同搞“文明活地”。但是也有人反对，他们说：“自古以来，煤矿就不干净，哪有毛坑屎不臭的？”“搞文明活地谁给钱？”领导上发动大伙讨论：“文明活地好不好？”“搞安全生产是为了谁？”讨论结果，绝大多数人都赞成，只有少数人的思想还不全通，那时工资是按件计算，搞“文明活地”不计件，因此，钱就在一些人的思想里作怪。经领导反复地讲解：目前利益要服从长远利益、个人利益要服从国家利益，工人们的思想才基本上统一了。
    二组这样作了一个时候以后，全组没有发生什么工伤事故。领导上就有意识地表扬他们。别组有些人不相信，也不服气，领导上组织他们去二组参观，果然一根折梁断柱都没有，人在煤巷里畅通无阻地进进出出，干活不那么累人了。经过多次的参观辩论和评比，“文明活地”就先后在全采区搞起来了。
    实行“文明活地”以后，工人干活痛快，安全较前更有保证了。据统计：实行一年后，事故少了一半，产量提高了五分之一，坑木节省了十分之一。而更重要的收获，是从这里打开了跃进的大门。干部们开始认识到，只要依靠群众，发动群众来搞，再大的难题，也能搞成功。
    实行“班组验收”的风波
    过了一个时期，有些人又松劲了。工人接班时，发现上一班交下来的活地不像以前那么干净了，工程质量也不好。向对方提出意见，对方不是摆客观困难，就是吹胡子瞪眼：“验收员都收了你管得着。”闹得两班工人不团结。
    这样，问题就从“文明活地”的验收，发展到工程验收的问题了。那时是验收员检查工程质量，验收员技术水平不高，加上活地多，验收不过来。做的活儿不合格，下一班只好重新做。结果国家多花钱，还影响出煤。
    老工人崔玉生看着心疼，建议领导上把验收工作交给群众管，由下一班的班长和工人验收上一班的“文明活地”，同时验收工程的数量和质量。
    怎样保证井下工程的质量，当时正是领导上考虑的重要问题之一。这个问题不解决，生产就上不去，“文明活地”也不能巩固。崔玉生的这个建议恰好解决了这个矛盾，于是就给它取了个名字，叫“班组验收”，并决定在采区普遍推行。
    开始推行的时候，有些工人对质量要求过严，常常不肯给上一班工人干的活验收签字，很多人忙了一天，一个钱也拿不到，他们说：“这简直是工人卡工人”，反映很大。
    这个办法能不能实行，有些人犹疑了。上级党委知道后，指出这是群众参加管理的一种好形式，应该坚持下去，但不能放开手不管，对目前的情况和问题应作具体的分析。这个采区的党组织下去一摸底，才知道出偏差的原因主要是思想工作做得不够，办法也交代得不具体，党对这件事缺乏领导。工人们的认真验收是他们当家作主、认真负责的表现，应该支持，但也要注意两种情况，一种是许多工人的技术水平确实不高，一种是有些工人在验收时要求不适当，有互不验收的现象。党总支立即召开了党员、班长和老工人等一系列的座谈会，问题放到桌面上一讨论，就弄清楚了。工人们都认为提高井下工程的质量是当前生产上的一个重要问题，不能马虎。但是应该明确制定验收的规格标准。领导上接受了工人们的意见，同时规定，如果真查到不合格的工程，不只要提出问题，还要指出原因和解决办法，使上一班的工人知道缺点好改进。为了使班组验收有领导地进行，又规定，假若验收和被验收两班意见不一致，那就以段长为主吸收老工人和两班班长组成检查小组去进行鉴定。
    这样作了以后，工人很满意。他们说：“自己检查，就得负责任，不能眼睁睁地看着国家的钱白白扔掉。”从一年后的统计数目字中可以看出：产量提高72.5％，事故减少90％，坑木节省27.3％，成本降低44.5％（当然，这些成绩和以后搞的“工程部署交底”也有一定的关系）。但更重要的是：许多工人的技术水平，随着班组的严格验收提高了。如五组工人唐子庄搭的棚子两次验收不合格，验收时给他指出原因和办法，以后他作的棚子都合乎规格了。干部们收获更大，他们谈起“班组验收”时总是这样说，这件事又帮助我们长了一个经验，作任何事不但要相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，而且还要到群众中去领导群众。
    三结合的好形式——“工程部署交底”
    不久，采区连着发生了两件事：四○二南槽有个地方塌顶了，四二八大槽也碰到同样的情形。这是为什么？工人说：“我们像算盘珠子似的，领导上拨到哪里，就到哪里，不了解情况，心里没底，怨不得我们！”领导呢？一天到晚忙得不可开交，这个段长跑来说：“没活地了，群众向班长要任务，班长催我，我只好来向上面要。”那个段长说：“计划不完全符合实际，下井后，新开了一个回采工作面，原来的设备和工具都不够用了，工人正停工等工具，请领导想办法。”
    怎么办？成天坐在办公室不能解决问题呀！为什么不把工程部署交给群众出出主意呢？班组验收制不就是群众提出来的吗？那不是很解决问题吗！
    他们想出了工程部署交底的办法：每年、每季、每月的生产计划和工程部署在领导干部中讨论拟定后，逐级交给工人讨论，补充修改，最后经领导批准执行。
    工人很高兴。他们说，现在心里清楚得像一面镜子，每天作多少，在哪里作，用什么法儿作，都明明白白，不像以前那样，下到井里才临时分派任务。工人们非常积极，每天上班前都开十五分钟的“施工会”，把活计搞清楚以后才下井。因为心里有数，效率、成本样样都算计，碰到自己有权解决的问题，自己就想法解决。班长刘来全、刘俊兴在四二八东一石门看见过去一个开过的塘，根据他们的经验判断，里面还有煤，就建议领导开斜坡，由南面反过去?塘，经领导批准执行后，结果多开采了两个星期的煤。
    这样作以后，生产日日上升，领导很高兴。他们说，现在不要整天在办公室打转转了。领导想得不周到的地方，群众都给提出来了。领导能常常下井检查工作，工作主动了。班长和工人也很高兴，他们说，工程部署交底以后，思想解放了，碰到自己职权范围内的问题，自己就动手解决。实行没多久，许多工人已学会画工程草图，技术提高了。
    “走群众路线没错！”干部们在一连串的事实面前，更坚定地相信这个真理了。
    政治工作和物质利益的统一——“劳动卡片”
    去年10月，全采区改计件工资制为计时工资制。头两个月，大伙的心气足，任务完成得好。到12月，情况开始发生变化，回采工作面的破方掘进和修护工作都完不成计划，大伙都乐意去回采。回采出来的煤有数目，成绩写到账面上，谁都能看得见。个别班长验收时，看见搭的一些棚不合格，也不积极提意见，他们心里想：“干好干坏都拿那么多钱，何必去得罪人呢！”
    这样下去不行呀！工人们说，得想办法，不然谁干得好，谁干得不好，谁有什么优点，谁有什么缺点，大伙都不知道，没个督促的，那怎么前进呀！
    老工人毕文明夜里躺在床上琢磨：想个什么法儿，能让国家计划完成得好，能让工友们都前进呢？
    搞个个人计划怎么样？每天下井前每人都谈谈个人的计划，今天要完成多少，收工时查一查实际完成多少，把成绩登记到劳动卡片上，这样谁不好好干，大伙都知道，在班的生活会上可以讨论。完成好的，给予表扬，鼓励他先进再先进。
    毕文明想了十几天，心里有点头绪了，就把自己的想法告诉领导。
    计件工资改为计时工资后，找一种什么形式来发扬工人的积极性，这是一个极其重要的问题，毕文明提供的劳动登记的办法，不仅在政治上对工人有教育意义，而且可以作为以后评奖评级的参考，这是一个好办法。领导支持他的倡议，同时让他们小组开会讨论。会上，大伙异口同声地说：“对！就这样办，谁脸上没两块肉，谁也不愿老叫人批评呀！”
    定额多少，现在大伙没有顾虑了。以前实行计件工资制的时候，干得太多了，怕提高定额，现在可以敞开提了。修护工说，他们在大巷里支的棚子，定额可以由三架、五架改成已经达到的十架到十五架。掘进工说，过去一天掘一点八公尺，现在可以掘二公尺或二公尺五。谁都愿意走在前头。
    毕文明提的办法很快就在全采区推行开了。工人们根据已往的生产情况，自报定额，民主评议。他们除在上班以前举行十五分钟的“施工会”外，下班以后还开十五分钟的“收工会”，在“收工会”上，班长把各人的劳动量登记在卡片上，逐名向工人们提出报告。这些报告成为每周生活会上讨论的主要资料：谁劳动得好，谁劳动得不好，为什么好，为什么不好，怎样改进，工人们就这样在会上互相帮助，互相砥励。
    今年1月份实行后，只一个月，成绩就显出来了：和去年8月比较，产量提高30.5％，事故减少了80％，成本降低18.2％。
    生产上一度落后的工人也赶到前面去了。如四组的掘进破方工人，去年9月实行计件工资制时，一工掘进零点九二六米，改计时工资后，12月一工只掘进零点三米，效率降低了三分之二，今年1月实行个人劳动登记后，掘到一点零零六米，比计件工资时还要好得多。
    计时工资加“劳动卡片”，并以“劳动卡片”的纪录作为评奖、评级的参考，这就把对职工的政治工作和职工的物质利益统一起来了。
    找到了发展生产力的新途径
    从搞“文明活地”、“班组验收”、“工程交底”到实行“个人劳动卡片”，都是一环紧扣着一环，每一环的出现和形成，又都把群众运动引向深化，使生产水平大进一步。这个采区1957年前半年的煤产量是十三万多吨，而1958年前半年的煤产量则迅速上升到十九万多吨了。但是，生产上的潜力是不是已经挖尽了呢？不！一连串的革新和胜利，鼓舞着干部和群众继续寻求发展生产力的新途径。他们在上级党委召开的一次跃进会议上，听到了一个掌子面可以组织高产的经验以后，一些新的想法立刻在他们的脑海中翻腾：本采区的生产组织状况能令人满意么？在矿井里，为什么人和设备都还有窝工的现象……？煤炭工业和其他许多工业有所不同的一个重要特点，是它受制于设备、原料等等的程度较小，人的作用特别大，多发挥一个人的效率就能多出不少煤，可以说是“有人就有煤”。因此，发挥每个生产工人的潜能，提高他们的劳动生产率，就成为煤炭工业中开展丰产运动中的一个关键性的问题。
    他们决定通过开展大面积丰产运动，调整劳动组织，在提高劳动生产率的目标下，把生产管理工作全面地带动起来。
    试点工作迅速在四组、一组接着又在六组开始。过去，这三个组是分散在各为六十公尺长的三个掌子面上，现在，这三个组在分别完成了各组掌子面的开采任务后，就先后把人力集中在一起，通盘安排在一个一百二十公尺长的掌子面和运输道上，根据正规作业的要求，在较前大大开阔了的掌子面上，有步骤、有秩序地向煤层开战。工人们说：现在可以“甩开膀子来干”了。他们的积极性更加高涨，运输工人向回采工挑战说：“采下的煤运不出，我们做检讨，没煤给我们运，你们得负责！”回采工人说：“保证叫你们来回不得闲，腿酸腰也酸！”运输工三个人干五个人的活，省下两个人去采煤。分别在南北坡上回收木柱的安政德和高景仁，谁都想先把木柱回出来，好抢先使用电钻多采一些煤，结果安政德刚拿到电钻，高景仁也及时取到电缆，电钻电缆不配套，谁也使不成，落在以往这两个小伙子谁也不会让谁的，可是，这一天，高景仁却把电缆送到南坡安在安政德的电钻上，并帮他在煤层上打眼，随后安政德也到北坡和高景仁一同操作。
    生产上的这一改革，把生产水平推到了一个新的高度：第一，开采面拓宽以后，使在急倾斜厚煤层条件下的先进采煤法——多塘回采法，在生产上得到了进一步的发挥，产煤量可以因此显著上长；第二，采煤速度加快，巷道维修时间就相应地缩短，消耗在这方面的坑木，维修工和其他维护费用可以大大节减；第三，更重要的，是劳动力集中使用后，在部署合理的条件下，除可以大大发挥每个工人的劳动效率外，还可节省出一批人力。这三个组在改革前的下井人数为一百零七人，改革后为九十三人，如果调整得更合理些，还可能节省出更多的人力。此外，还节省出三分之一的电钻、电缆等机械设备，管理工作也较前方便了。下表就是这三个组在改革前（1958年1月至6月）和正式改革后（1958年9月至1959年2月）几项主要指标的对比：
    四组的工人吹响了更大跃进的号角：大面积丰产的理想试验成功，更大的跃进开步了。全采区从3月份起，决定完全消灭万吨产量以下的掌子面，在坚决完成国家计划七十万吨煤的年产量以后，再为国家增产五万吨煤！也就是说，今年每个职工平均每天要为国家生产三点五八吨煤，这个数字比1957年提高203％，比1958年提高84％。
        人是实现大跃进的决定因素
    1958年和1957年相比，1958年除开拓任务比1957年较少以外，其他条件都基本相同，为什么这两年的生产水平却相距这样大呢？
    是人起了作用，人的思想起了变化，党的领导水平提高了，干部能够联系群众了。而这一切，是和全民整风运动紧密地联系在一起的。
    全采区七百四十三名职工中，有三分之二是解放前的老矿工，他们是这个采区的骨干。大跃进中干劲最足的是他们，提出许多重要建议的也是他们。他们觉悟高，技术好，加上这几年全国大跃进形势的鼓舞，解放了思想，敢想敢说敢干，在生产上和历次运动中起的作用很大。其中，也有少数老矿工还残留着过去“走小窑”时期的散漫状态，他们也有保守的一面，例如对于搞“文明活地”等这一类新事物，一开始时还不容易接受，但只要党组织一解释，他们的看法就逐步改变过来了。另外三分之一的职工，绝大多数也都是好劳动者，他们在老矿工的影响和帮助下，特别是在整风运动以后，他们的阶级觉悟也都有了很大的提高。下表是整风前后全体职工阶级觉悟情况的统计：
    这批有阶级觉悟的老工人，是这个采区去年大跃进的重要基础。但当工人们分析大跃进的总的原因时，却异口同声地说，是党的正确领导和整风运动的结果。
    这个采区的党总支共有委员七人，除书记原是地方干部外，行政领导干部、工会主席、共青团书记和其他委员都是矿工出身。他们都谦虚地说自己的文化低，理论差，工作经验不多，但是他们有一个共同的特征：和工人有密切的联系，对工人的思想、感情有很深的了解，加上上级党委及时而具体的领导，因此，党总支委员会在以下三个方面做得很突出：
    第一，从群众中来，到群众中去。过去一两年中所进行的一些重大改革，大都直接来自群众的建议，或者是在群众创造的启示下所采取的。有些是上级的意图，但也往往通过典型试验，让群众有了实践的感性知识后，才在群众中普遍推行。
    第二，政治思想工作抓得紧、抓得好。党内有经常的批评和自我批评，错误的思想一抬头，党组织就讨论开了。四组刘来全班生产成绩比较好，党员副班长唐凤桐因此就认为他这一班了不起，“别的班追也追不上”，在这种情绪支配下，班内的出勤很差，而另外两个班却悄悄地赶过去了。党总支立即以反对骄傲自满为题，在干部中进行检查，唐凤桐在党的帮助下，端正了认识，不久全班的生产就又赶上去了。有一天，一个工人在会上用象棋中的“将”和“车”的关系，批评采区个别段的领导干部缺乏“一盘棋”的思想。他把采区领导人比做“将”，说他只能在“将”的行走格格上行动，而段的个别助理却像一只“车”，任意横走直行，不照顾全局。党总支根据群众的这个反映，结合干部思想上存在的一些问题，立即在党员中进行了对本位主义的检查和批判。许多错误的思想和倾向，就在这“作云未成雨”的时候消散了。
    第三，在群众中，有一些很好的组织和制度，来保证党的政治思想领导在群众中贯彻执行。这个采区的各个基层组织——生产班，都建立了以党员为领导，有班长、老工人、积极分子参加的核心小组，全班的生产业务技术问题和对职工的思想教育，都首先在这个小组内酝酿，然后分别提到全班工人大会或每周一次的生活会上去讨论。工人们在会上表扬好人好事遇到干劲不足或思想作风不对头的人，就根据团结—批评—团结的原则，坦率地帮他揭发错误，指明方向，积极地始终一贯地帮助他改进。这种组织和制度，使正气风发，邪气不能抬头，党的方针、政策得到坚定的贯彻。
    但是，所有这一切，都是和干部作风分不开的。干部作风的主要特点，就是和群众打成一片，不摆架子，凡事能和群众商量，并且自己带头动手干。当工人在井下紧张战斗时，领导也汗流浃背地和他们一起挖煤、推车。当群众犯了错误或是思想苦闷时。领导就会出现在他们身边，耐心地说服教育他们。甚至谁家夫妇或婆媳吵嘴打架了，领导也来劝解，天大的事，叫领导几说几劝，乌云就消散了。工人说：“领导比我们的亲人还了解我们，还亲我们。”
    全采区一共只有二十九名脱产干部，占职工总数4％还弱。干部少，办起事来挺痛快，党组织一经研究决定，党政工团的干部就分头去办，一个方针，一齐出动，一下子就贯到底。
    这些好作风，好像一座桥，把党的心思和群众的心思联系起来了。
    党的群众路线的胜利
    大华采区全面大跃进的经验是很丰富的。它突出地指明：在大跃进中，及时发现和总结群众在生产实践中的问题和经验，发现、掌握和解决实践中提出的矛盾，是推动和组织群众不断跃进的一个中心环节。但要做到这一点，必须在政治挂帅的基础上，首先教育干部在思想上树立相信群众的观点，在工作方法上坚持群众路线，在生活作风上和群众打成一片。大华采区的党组织在上级党委的具体领导下，正是抓住了这一条链子，所以在伟大的群众运动中，能够及时发现新的矛盾，提出适当的解决办法，把生产推向新的高峰。
    大华采区的全面大跃进，证明了党的群众路线的胜利。
    当然，事物总是从粗浅逐步走向深入，从不完备逐步走向完备。大华采区大跃进的经验虽然是丰富的，但还是粗浅的和不完备的。要走向深入和完备，还有待于整顿、巩固和提高，有待于群众的再实践和再丰富。还须看到，这个采区在大跃进的过程中，虽然成绩很大，但还存在着一些可以避免的弱点，比如生产准备工作有时还做得不够好。特别重要的是，1959年的跃进计划很大，但措施还没有完全落实，计划还不能按旬、按日、按班地完成。这些都是一些具体问题，只要认真落实地抓起来，困难会被克服，问题将会迅速得到解决。
    有阶级觉悟较高的工人队伍，有能够密切联系群众的干部，有全面大跃进的丰富经验，有非以往任何一年可以比拟的物质基础和精神条件，可以相信，在职工们的积极努力下，一个更大更好更全面的跃进，是可以计日程功的。（附图表）
