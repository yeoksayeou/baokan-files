    “Snow and Wheat”
    Bian Ruixian, student of Beijing University of Aeronautics

    For many days, classmates have often talked about "snow and wheat." Although we don't rely on the heavens for food today, the lack of snowfall for several months will affect this year's bumper wheat harvest. A heavy snow fell a few days ago, and the newspapers reported that it was a rare heavy snow in a century. The snow covered the ground by a foot, relieving the drought, and everyone was overjoyed. Classmates unanimously said, "It's good snow," and "Snowfall is like snowfall of white flour." In the past, classmates associated snow with snowmen, thinking about how to appreciate the snow scene when they saw snow. However, today they associate snow with wheat. This cannot but be said to be a change in ideological feelings.

    This change has been most significant in the past year. Due to the vigorous implementation of the Party's education policy, students have not only greatly improved their theoretical knowledge, but also mastered practical production knowledge that they could not learn in the past. At the same time, students have increased their ideological feelings for the working people and love the cause of the working people. The view of "snow and wheat" is just a small example.

    The new semester has begun, and the students are full of energy and confidence. Many students have revised their "Red and Expert" plans, vowing to further implement the Party's education policy. Last semester we were victorious! This semester, under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of the teachers, coupled with the students' soaring enthusiasm and firm confidence, there is no doubt that 1959 will achieve even greater results than 1958!

    “雪和小麦”
    北京航空学院学生  边瑞先
    很多日子以来，同学们经常谈说“雪和小麦”的事。虽然我们今天不指靠天吃饭，但是几个月不下雪，对今年的小麦大丰收也是会有影响的。前些日子下了一场大雪，报上说这是百年来难得的大雪。雪盖地一尺，旱象解除，个个心欢喜，同学们都异口同声地说“是好雪”，“下雪等于下白面”。过去同学们是把雪和雪人联系起来，看到雪就想到怎样欣赏雪景，然而今天是把雪和小麦联系起来，这不能不说是思想感情的变化。
    这种变化在过去的一年里最显著，由于大力贯彻了党的教育方针，使同学们不仅在理论知识上有了很大提高，而且还掌握了过去所不能学到的实际生产知识，同学们同时增长了劳动人民思想感情，热爱了劳动人民的事业。“雪和小麦”的看法只不过是一个小例子。
    新的学期又开始了，同学们精神焕发，信心百倍，不少同学又重新修订了自己的“红专”规划，誓把党的教育方针进一步贯彻好。上学期是我们胜利了！这学期在党的领导下，在教师的教导下，再加上同学们冲天干的劲，必胜的信心，无疑，1959年一定会取得比1958年更大的成绩！
