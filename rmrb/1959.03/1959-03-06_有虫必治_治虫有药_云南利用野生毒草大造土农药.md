Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 5th: Yunnan is using wild poisonous weeds to produce more than 200 kinds of indigenous pesticides. They are also using indigenous methods to produce powerful insecticides such as "666" and lime sulfur mixture.

Most areas of Yunnan have a mild climate and a short frost period, resulting in many kinds and widespread distribution of crop pests and diseases. As early as the end of last year, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting on indigenous pesticides in Yuanjiang County, requiring all regions to fully utilize existing resources and rely on their own efforts to ensure that there is treatment for every pest and medicine for every treatment. At present, pest control headquarters have been established from the province to the county level, making comprehensive plans for the prevention and control of pests and diseases. Communes have extracted a certain amount of labor to form specialized indigenous pesticide teams, and are vigorously running indigenous pesticide factories. Xiangyun County, after conducting in-depth resource surveys and summarizing the masses' experience in combating pests, has found more than 160 kinds of indigenous pesticides, of which more than 70 have a kill rate of 70% to 80%. Several indigenous pesticides, such as indigenous "666" and lime sulfur mixture, have a kill rate of 100%.

    有虫必治　治虫有药
    云南利用野生毒草大造土农药
    据新华社昆明5日电　云南各地利用野生毒草造出土农药两百多种，还用土法造出了“六六六”、石灰硫磺合剂等威力猛的杀虫剂。
    云南大部分地区气候温和，霜期很短，农作物的病虫害种类多，分布广。中共云南省委早在去年年底就在元江县召开土农药现场会议，要求各地充分利用现有资源，自力更生，做到有虫必治，治虫有药。目前从省到县都已经成立防虫指挥部，作出防治病虫害的全面规划。各公社抽出一定的劳动力组成土农药专业队，大办土农药工厂。祥云县经过深入调查资源，总结群众与虫害斗争的经验，共已找到了一百六十多种土农药，其中有七十多种杀虫率在70％到80％以上，土制“六六六”、石硫合剂等几种土农药的杀虫率更达到了百分之百。
