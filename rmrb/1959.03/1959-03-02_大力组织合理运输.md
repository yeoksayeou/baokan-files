    Vigorously Organize Rational Transportation
    The increase in the quantity of materials needing transportation nationwide is very likely to exceed the increase in transportation capacity. This is the basic situation on the transportation front this year. This situation requires not only accelerating the increase in transportation tools such as locomotives, vehicles, ships, and automobiles, as well as new line equipment and port station facilities, so that transportation capacity can also have a relatively large increase as much as possible, but most importantly, it requires transportation departments to improve transportation organization and tap the potential of existing transportation equipment. An important aspect of improving transportation organization and tapping the potential of existing transportation equipment is to promote a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for various materials.
    In transportation work, we often see this phenomenon: on the one hand, the transport volume is large, the transport capacity is small, and the transportation is very busy, and even many things cannot be transported out; but on the other hand, after careful consideration, the transportation of many materials is not necessary. For example, the two-way transportation of rice from Place A to Place B and from Place B to Place A, the reverse transportation of timber to forest areas, and the over-distance transportation of sourcing goods from thousands of miles away instead of using local materials are all irrational transportation practices. Irrational transportation is the biggest waste in transportation work because the manpower and material resources used in this type of transportation are unnecessary or can be greatly saved. In capitalist society, due to the anarchy of production, irrational transportation phenomena are unavoidable. In socialist society, which practices a planned economy, it is entirely possible to eliminate two-way, duplicate, reverse, and certain over-distance irrational transportation. Promoting a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for various materials is an effective measure to eliminate irrational transportation, save national transportation capacity, and rationally use various transportation tools.
    Since 1954, China has successively promoted a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance in the transportation of major materials such as grain, coal, timber, ore, petroleum, salt, cement, pig iron, and mineral building materials, and has achieved great results; especially the rational transportation of grain, the achievements are even more significant. Although the amount of grain transferred in China has increased year by year, the expenditure on transportation costs and the transportation capacity used have been saved year by year, and the transfer of grain has become more rational year by year. In 1955, the amount of grain transferred increased by 8.29 million tons compared to 1954, but transportation costs were saved by 120 million yuan. In 1956, the amount of grain transferred increased by another 2.3 million tons compared to 1955, but transportation costs were saved by another 190 million yuan. In 1957, although the transportation mileage and transportation costs increased slightly due to the needs of certain disaster areas, the average freight rate was still lower than in 1955 and 1954. In 1958, encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, grain transfer work at all levels established flow directions, emphasized rationality everywhere, interlocked at every step, and connected seamlessly, integrating rational grain transportation in rural areas, branch lines, main lines, and urban areas into a single chain, making grain transportation work more meticulous and rational.
    Promoting a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for various materials can not only eliminate irrational transportation and save transportation capacity, but also is a major measure to improve the state's economic planning and rationally use national resources. The actual work in recent years has proved that promoting a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for various materials also has the following benefits: First, it closely integrates production, transportation, and sales, making production and sales, supply, and allocation a unified whole, which is conducive to better planning production, planning supply, and planning transportation, so that the supply of materials can be better guaranteed; Second, it shortens the transportation distance and turnover time of materials, reduces the circulation costs of materials, thus accelerating the production process and reducing product costs; Third, it is conducive to implementing the policy of rationally using national resources and "local materials, local supply," so that local factories and mines can give full play to their efficiency, promote the rational distribution of productive forces, and make the use of materials more rational and economical; Fourth, it can more accurately calculate the flow direction and quantity of goods, more rationally use various transportation tools, arrange the comprehensive utilization and comprehensive development of various transportation tools, and promote the rational distribution of the national transportation network; Fifth, it creates more favorable conditions for the implementation of a supply system in which production units uniformly deliver goods.
    In order to fully utilize existing transportation capacity to complete more transport volume, so as to guarantee a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, we must further organize rational transportation. Part of the irrational transportation is over-distance transportation, mainly caused by the irrational distribution of industry left over from old China, which needs to be gradually adjusted when arranging industrial production and basic construction, according to the principle that production factories and mines are close to raw material and fuel production areas. For example, existing timber processing plants, paper mills, sleeper preservative plants, etc., should be gradually moved to areas close to timber production areas; when planning the construction of coal washing plants, the coal washing plants should be located as close as possible to coal mines; when planning iron smelting plants, the iron smelting plants should be located close to coal mines or iron ore production areas; the suburbs of major cities and industrial towns should immediately establish vegetable supply bases to reduce long-distance transportation of vegetables; building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel should basically be sourced and manufactured locally, so as to achieve local supply; the southern provinces that currently lack coal should also establish coal bases as soon as possible, and the construction of timber bases in the south should also be accelerated to reduce the transportation of northern coal to the south and northern timber to the south. Without starting from the rational distribution of productive forces, this type of over-distance transportation is unavoidable. However, two-way, duplicate, reverse, and some other over-distance irrational transportation are mainly caused by the lack of planning and organization in production, supply and sales, and transportation work, poorly planned material allocation work, and the lack of close links between production, supply, transportation, and sales. As long as we strengthen planning and organization, better fix production and sales, supply, and allocation relationships, and promote a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance, we can gradually change this irrational transportation situation. Planning departments, material production departments, commercial departments, transportation departments, and material using units should work together to do a better job of rational transportation.
    The key to doing a good job in rational transportation lies in establishing the idea of "the whole country as a single chess game." Without the idea of "the whole country as a single chess game," and if everyone starts from local interests, there can be no rational transportation. Imagine, if material production departments, commercial departments, or material using units only seek their own convenience, regardless of the length of transportation distance, the amount of freight, or whether the flow of materials is rational, or whether transportation capacity is wasted, how can irrational transportation be eliminated? For example, if transportation departments only care about loading more trucks and ships, regardless of whether this transportation is rational or necessary, how can irrational transportation be eliminated? Only when everyone establishes the idea of "the whole country as a single chess game" and starts from the overall interests can the rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for materials be smoothly promoted. Therefore, material production departments, commercial departments, and material using units should pay attention to the rational transportation of materials. Transportation departments should further strengthen their ties with various departments, strictly review the transportation plans proposed by various departments, and eliminate all kinds of irrational transportation, on the premise of strengthening their service to the various departments of the national economy.
    To do a good job in rational transportation, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to the mass line. Rational transportation involves all aspects of production, transportation, sales, and use, and is closely related to production and people's lives. This work must be placed under the unified leadership of the Party committee, relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, in order to discover and eliminate irrational transportation and smoothly promote a rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance for materials. Especially after the comprehensive great leap forward of the national economy in 1958, the major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, coal, grain, and cotton have all increased exponentially, new industrial and mining bases and urban and rural areas have been rapidly formed, and there have been many new changes in the distribution of productive forces, production and sales relationships, and allocation situations. We hope that all localities, based on these new situations, will further promote the rational transportation system of regional production and sales balance on the existing basis, so as to make transportation work adapt to the needs of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in all departments of the national economy.

    大力组织合理运输
    全国需要运输的物资的数量的增加很可能超过运输力的增加，这是今年交通运输战线上的基本形势。这个形势除了要求加速增加机车、车辆、船舶、汽车等运输工具和新的线路设备、港站设备，使运力也尽可能有比较大的增加之外，最主要的，还是要求交通运输部门改进运输组织工作，挖掘现有运输设备的潜力。改进运输组织工作，挖掘现有运输设备潜力的一个重要方面，是推行各种物资分区产销平衡的合理运输制度。
    在运输工作中，我们常常可以看到这种现象：一方面，运量大、运力小，运输非常繁忙，甚至许多东西运不出去；但是另一方面，许多物资的运输仔细推敲起来，并无必要。例如甲地往乙地运大米，乙地又往甲地运大米的对流运输，把木材运到林区去的倒流运输，不在附近就地取材而从千里以外组织货源的过远运输等等，这些都是不合理的运输。不合理的运输是运输工作中最大的浪费，因为用在这种运输上的人力、物力都是不必要的，或者是可以大大节省的。在资本主义社会里，由于生产的无政府状态，运输的不合理现象是无法避免的。在社会主义社会里，实行着计划经济，杜绝对流、重复、倒流以及某些过远的不合理运输却是完全可能的。推行各种物资分区产销平衡的合理运输制度，就是消除不合理的运输，节省国家运力，合理使用各种运输工具的一个有效措施。
    从1954年开始，我国就先后在粮食、煤炭、木材、矿石、石油、盐、水泥、生铁和矿物性建筑材料等主要物资的运输中，推行了分区产销平衡的合理运输制度，收到了很大的效果；特别是粮食的合理运输，成绩更加显著。我国粮食调运的数量虽然一年比一年增加，但是运输费用的支出和所用的运输力却一年比一年节省，粮食的调运也一年比一年更加合理。1955年粮食调运量比1954年增加了八百二十九万吨，运费却节省了一亿二千万元。1956年粮食调运量又比1955年增加了二百三十万吨，运费却又节省了一亿九千万元。1957年由于某些灾区的需要，运输里程和运输费用虽然稍有增加，但平均运费仍比1955年和1954年为低。1958年在工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞下，粮食调运工作层层订流向，处处讲合理，环环相扣，脉脉相通，把农村、支线、干线、城市各个环节的粮食合理运输贯通一气，形成一条龙，使粮食的运输工作更加细致、更加合理。
    推行各种物资分区产销平衡合理运输制度，不仅可以消除不合理的运输，节省运力，而且是提高国家经济的计划性，合理使用国家资源的一项重大措施。几年来的实际工作证明，推行各种物资分区产销平衡合理运输制度，还有以下一些好处：第一、把产、运、销密切结合在一起，使产销、供应和调拨结合成一个统一的整体，便于更好地进行计划生产、计划供应和计划运输，使物资的供应得到更大的保证；第二、缩短了物资的运输距离和周转时间，减少了物资的流转费用，因而加速了生产过程，降低了产品成本；第三、有利于贯彻合理使用国家资源和“就地取材，就地供应”的方针，使地方厂矿可以充分发挥效率，促进生产力的合理分布，使物资的使用更加合理和节约；第四、能够更精确地计算货物的流转方向和数量，更合理地使用各种运输工具，安排各种运输工具之间的综合利用和综合发展，促进全国运输网的合理分布；第五、为推行由生产单位统一送货的供应制度创造了更有利的条件。
    为了充分利用现有的运力完成更多的运量，以保证今年工农业生产的更大跃进，我们必须进一步组织合理运输。不合理的运输中有一部分过远运输，主要是由于旧中国遗留下来的工业分布的不合理状况造成的，这就需要在安排工业生产和基本建设时，根据生产厂矿接近原料、燃料产地的原则，逐步加以调整。例如现有的木材加工厂、造纸厂、枕木防腐厂等，应该逐步移到靠近木材产地的地区去；规划洗煤厂的建设时，应该使洗煤厂尽量靠近煤矿；规划炼铁厂时要使炼铁厂靠近煤矿或铁矿产地；各大城市和工业城镇的郊区，都应该立即建立蔬菜的供应基地，减少蔬菜的远途调运；砖、瓦、砂石等建筑材料更应该基本上就地取材和制造，做到就地供应；目前缺煤的南方各省也应该及早建立煤炭基地，南方的木材基地也应该加速建设，以减少北煤南运和北材南运。不从生产力的合理分布着手，这一类的过远运输是不可避免的。但是，对流、重复、倒流以及另一些过远的不合理运输，主要是由于生产、供销和运输工作的计划性和组织性不强，物资调拨工作计划不周，产、供，运、销联系不密切造成的。只要加强计划性和组织性，更好地固定产销、供应和调拨关系，推行分区产销平衡合理运输制度，就完全可以逐步改变这种运输不合理的状况。计划部门、物资生产部门、商业部门、运输部门和物资使用单位，应该共同努力，把合理运输工作做得更好。
    做好合理运输的关键，在于确立“全国一盘棋”的思想。没有“全国一盘棋”的思想，大家都从局部利益出发，就不可能有合理运输。试想，物资生产部门、商业部门或者物资使用单位，只图自己方便，不计运输距离的长短、运费的多少，不管物资的流向是否合理，运力是否浪费，怎么能消除不合理的运输呢？又例如，交通运输部门如果只管装车、装船装得多，不管这些运输是不是合理，是不是必要，又怎么能消除不合理的运输呢？只有大家都确立“全国一盘棋”的思想，从整体利益出发，才能顺利地推行物资分区产销平衡合理运输制度。因此，物资生产部门、商业部门和物资使用单位都要注意物资的合理运输。交通运输部门更应该在加强为国民经济各部门服务的前提下，进一步密切同各部门之间的联系，严格审查各部门所提出的运输计划，消除各种不合理的运输。
    要做好合理运输工作，必须加强党的领导，坚持群众路线。合理运输牵涉到产、运、销、用各个方面，同生产和人民的生活都有密切的关系。必须把这项工作置于党委的统一领导之下，依靠群众、发动群众，才能发现和消除不合理的运输，顺利地推行物资分区产销平衡合理运输制度。特别是经过1958年国民经济的全面大跃进，钢、煤、粮、棉等主要工农业产品都成倍地增长，新的工矿基地和城乡迅速形成，生产力的分布、产销关系和调运情况都有了很多新的变化。我们希望各地根据这些新的情况，在现有的基础上进一步推行分区产销平衡合理运输制度，这样才能使交通运输工作适应国民经济各部门更大更好更全面跃进的需要。
