    Several Fast-Growing, High-Quality Tree Species

    Mangrove
    Mangroves grow on muddy, sandy coasts in the tropics and subtropics that are regularly affected by tides. These plants have particularly well-developed aeration tissues, and their growth is not hindered even when submerged by seawater. Mangroves are evergreen throughout the year, with dense branches and twigs. Well-grown mangroves can reach a height of three zhang (approximately 10 meters), making them ideal tree species for coastal wave defense and bank protection. Mangroves have a wide range of uses. The bark contains an important industrial raw material - tannin. The wood can also be used for agricultural implements and fuel.

    Casuarina
    Casuarina is an excellent tree species for afforestation in coastal sandy wastelands. Its characteristics are salt and alkali resistance, and it is not afraid of tides. After planting, it can grow up to three meters in one year and five to six meters in two years. Its underground root system is well-developed, and it has strong wind resistance. It can withstand winds up to force 10 without damage. After planting, it immediately begins to resist wind and sand. The wood is very hard and can be used for railway sleepers and piles. The bark contains tannin, which can be used to make leather and dye fishing nets.

    Eucalyptus
    Eucalyptus is an excellent fast-growing tree species, generally maturing in six to seven years. Eucalyptus grows particularly vigorously in areas with deep, loose soil, around village residences, and along roadsides and fields. Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces have eucalyptus cultivation. This tree has a tall, straight trunk, and the wood has a fine, tough and durable texture, which can be widely used in various constructions. Eucalyptus leaves mostly contain aromatic volatile oils, which can be used as medicinal counterirritants and disinfectants, and can also be used as mineral processing solvents. Some bark also contains a large amount of tannin. (Attached image)

    几种速生优良树种
    红树林
    红树林生长在热带和亚热带海潮多泥沙的海岸上。这种植物通气组织特别发达，虽被海水淹没也不妨碍生长。红树四季常绿，枝桠密布，生长较好的可高达三丈，是海滨防浪护岸的理想树种。红树的用途很广，树皮含有重要的工业原料——鞣素，木材还可作农具和薪炭。
    木麻黄
    木麻黄是沿海沙荒造林的优良树种，它的特性是耐咸耐碱，不怕海潮，植后一年可高达三公尺，二年高达五、六公尺，地下根系发达，抗风力很强，一般在十级以下大风仍可不受损害，栽植后一年即显著地起抵抗风沙的作用。木材很坚硬，可作枕木及桩柱等用。树皮含有单宁，可供制皮革和染渔网用。
    桉树
    桉树是极好的速生树种，一般六、七年即生长成材。在土层深厚、疏松的土地上，村庄住宅周围、路旁田边等地，桉树生长特别壮旺。广东、福建、湖南、四川等省都有桉树栽培。这种树干高耸通直，木材纹理细致，坚韧耐用，可广泛用于各项建筑。桉叶大都含有芳香的挥发油，可作医药上用的消灸剂、杀菌剂，也可作选矿溶剂，有的树皮还含有多量单宁。（附图片）
