Cadres Participate in Physical Labor

The workers and peasants across the country are actively striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. At this time, the direct participation of leading cadres at the provincial, municipal, prefectural, and county levels in factory and rural labor is a tremendous encouragement to the working people nationwide.

Cadre participation in physical labor is a step of great significance. It can not only stimulate the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants and sweep away the ingrained habits of bureaucracy, but more importantly, it can ensure that leading cadres operate among the people as ordinary laborers and pave the way for the gradual integration of mental and physical labor.

In our socialist society, the system of exploitation and the social foundations that formed it have been eliminated. The relationship between people is one of complete equality. Although people's division of labor in their positions varies greatly, their social status is not distinguished by nobility or baseness. Everyone is an ordinary worker in society. As long as the state exists, our state working cadres, no matter how great their responsibilities, are completely equal to ordinary workers and peasants in their social status.

Our cadres are produced from the masses, and new cadres must be constantly produced from the masses. The work done by cadres is entirely based on the needs of the people, and they must have no other purpose in their work than to strive to realize the interests of the broad masses. In order for the people's cause to triumph, there must be such a group of cadres who wholeheartedly serve the people, accept the tasks entrusted to them by the people, and lead the people forward in all aspects.

State functionaries in socialist countries must appear as ordinary laborers. Lenin repeatedly argued this point. In "State and Revolution," Lenin repeatedly pointed out that after the proletarian revolution is realized, state officials should become merely staff members who carry out the entrustment of the working people, making them "overseers and accountants" responsible to the voters, subject to recall at any time, and receiving ordinary salaries. Lenin strove to find a way to integrate state functionaries with ordinary workers and peasants. In "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues," Lenin believed that communists must labor together with workers and peasants. Lenin said: "Only by integrating with workers and peasants in labor can one become a true communist."

Communists must integrate with workers and peasants in labor. This is the fundamental starting point for our Party Central Committee's requirement that cadres participate in physical labor.

Under the current social conditions, a certain division of labor between state working cadres and the ordinary workers and peasants is entirely necessary. However, precisely because there is a division of labor in positions between cadres and the masses, a relationship of leadership and being led, and they cannot often closely approach each other, there is also the possibility of mutual estrangement between them. Here, it is impossible not to consider the influence left over from the old society. In the old society, the relationship between officials and the people was one of rulers and the ruled. The relationship between our cadres and the masses is essentially different from this kind of relationship between officials and the people. However, if our cadres do not constantly pay attention to closely contacting the masses, or are affected by the influences left over from the old society and do not pay attention to overcoming them, they will lose the true qualities of a people's servant. Therefore, the Party Central Committee particularly emphasizes the need to educate cadres to always appear among the masses in the posture of an ordinary laborer, so that cadres do not consider themselves to have a special status because they hold different positions in the social division of labor and become detached from the masses and reality. Implementing the system of cadre participation in physical labor is an extremely effective method of educating our cadres in this regard and an extremely effective method of continuously improving our cadre-masses relationship in practical life.

When the rectification movement began in 1957, the Party Central Committee issued instructions pointing out the important significance of leading cadres participating in physical labor and stipulating that leading cadres participating in physical labor be established as a system. The Party Central Committee, in its instructions on the participation of leading personnel at all levels in physical labor, awakened all Party comrades to pay attention: Our Party has been with the masses for thirty years, working hard and winning the great victory of the revolution. The arduous task before us now is to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry and modern agriculture. To realize this task, we must continue to carry forward our Party's tradition of linking with the masses and working hard. Leading cadres at all levels participating in a portion of physical labor, combining mental and physical labor, is a system for carrying forward this fine tradition and also a goal to be achieved by the current rectification movement. After this, the Central Committee continued to issue instructions requiring all types of cadres in all departments, without exception, to participate in physical labor whenever possible.

The vast number of cadres across the country have implemented the Party Central Committee's instructions with practical actions: not only using their spare time to participate in physical labor, but also going to the countryside or factories in batches for a certain period to participate in labor. Cadres are sent down to the countryside to become ordinary commune members, and sent down to factories to become ordinary workers. They eat, live, and labor together with other commune members and workers, and they share the same production tasks and abide by the same labor discipline. Cadres in the army, including senior commanders, are also sent down to companies in batches to serve as ordinary soldiers. Among our vast number of cadres, participation in physical labor has become a common practice and has taken various forms.

Experience over the past year has proven that the participation of cadres, especially leading cadres, in physical labor has a very significant effect on overcoming the subjective, bureaucratic style of being detached from the masses and reality. Many cadres have reported that after participating in physical labor, because they have gone deep into reality and placed themselves among the masses as ordinary laborers, cadres and the masses can better understand each other and their hearts are closely linked. Some things that were not easy to hear in the past have been heard, and some things that were not easy to see in the past have been seen. What the masses are thinking and what they are asking for can be understood in a timely manner. Many new problems related to production, work, and the lives of the masses can be discovered more quickly, discussed with the masses in a timely manner, and resolved. With the experience of actually participating in production, cadres can lead production work and other work in a more concrete and detailed manner.

The improvement of cadre style will inevitably have a major impact on the broad masses. The deeply rooted view of despising physical labor in the old society and the opposing relationship between officials and the people in the old society have left a certain impact on the broad masses. This impact cannot be easily swept away. If the masses see some shortcomings in the style of some cadres, they are more likely to have a wrong understanding of our cadre-masses relationship. Experience over the past year has proven that the participation of cadres, especially leading cadres, in physical labor has played a major role in sweeping away some old views among the masses regarding physical labor and the cadre-masses relationship. Through the vivid facts of cadres participating in physical labor, the people have further understood their status as masters of the country and have further correctly recognized the relationship between cadres and the masses. In many communes and enterprises, the participation of cadres in physical labor has given the masses great encouragement, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been significantly improved, and the trust and love of the masses for the cadres have also been greatly enhanced. Cadres closely link with the masses, and the masses sincerely trust the cadres. On this basis, a situation is formed in which cadres and the masses are integrated, which is the most fundamental key to the success of any of our undertakings.

Cadre participation in physical labor is not only of great significance at present, but, as mentioned earlier, it is a long-term matter in the future. Since our cadres come from the masses, they should return to the masses at any time as needed and become ordinary workers and peasants. As the cultural level, political experience, and communist ideological awareness of the people become increasingly widespread, the difference between mental and physical labor will gradually disappear. Therefore, the system of cadre participation in physical labor, cadres becoming workers, and cadres becoming peasants should become a fundamental system of our country and should be continued. With the rich experience of 1958, we should make better arrangements and achieve better results in 1959 based on summarizing the existing experience.

    干部参加体力劳动
    全国的工人农民正在为实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进而积极奋斗。在这样的时候，许多省级、市级、地委级和县级的领导干部直接参加了工厂农村的劳动，这对于全国的劳动人民是一个莫大的鼓舞。
    干部参加体力劳动是一项具有重大意义的步骤。它不但可以激励工人农民的生产积极性，扫除官僚主义的积习，更重要的是它能够保证领导干部以普通劳动者的姿态在人民中间活动，并且为脑力劳动和体力劳动的逐步结合开辟了一条道路。
    在我们的社会主义社会中，已经消灭了剥削制度和形成剥削制度的社会基础。人和人之间的关系，是一种完全平等的关系。尽管人们在职务上的分工千差万别，但他们的社会地位并没有贵贱之分。每个人都是社会上的一个普通劳动者。当国家还存在的时候，我们的国家工作干部，不论他所负的责任多么重大，在社会地位上，都是和一个普通的工人农民完全平等的。
    我们的干部是从群众中产生的，而且要不断地从群众中产生新的干部。干部所做的工作完全以人民群众的需要为根据，除了努力实现广大群众的利益以外，他们在工作中不能有任何其他的目的。为了使人民的事业取得胜利，就必须有这样一批忠心耿耿地为人民服务的干部，接受人民所授予的任务，在各个方面领导人民前进。
    社会主义国家的国家工作人员必须以普通劳动者的姿态出现，这个观点列宁曾经多次加以论证。在“国家与革命”一书中，列宁曾再三指出，在无产阶级革命实现以后，应当使国家官吏成为不过是执行劳动人民的委托的工作人员，使他们成为对选民负责的、随时可以撤换的而且是领取普通薪金的“监工和会计”。列宁努力寻求使国家工作人员同普通的工人农民打成一片的道路。在“青年团的任务”一文中，列宁认为共产主义者必须同工人农民一起去劳动。列宁说：“只有在劳动中同工农打成一片，才能成为真正的共产主义者。”
    共产主义者必须在劳动中与工人农民打成一片，这也就是我们党中央要求干部参加体力劳动的基本出发点。
    在现在的社会条件下，国家工作干部和普通的工人农民群众之间的一定的分工，是完全必要的。但是，正因为干部和群众之间有职务上的分工，有领导和被领导的关系，并且不能常常互相密切地接近，他们之间也就有互相隔阂的可能。在这里，还不能不考虑到旧社会残留下来的影响。在旧社会中的官民关系，是统治者和被统治者的关系，我们的干部和群众的关系，跟这种官民关系是在本质上不同的。不过，我们的干部，如果不经常注意密切联系群众，或者受到了从旧社会残留下来的影响，而不注意去加以克服，他就会失去一个人民勤务员所应有的本色。所以，党中央特别强调要教育干部永远以一个普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现，使干部不因为自己在社会分工中担负不同的职务，而自以为具有特殊的身分，脱离群众、脱离实际。贯彻执行干部参加体力劳动的制度，正是在这方面教育我们的干部的一个极其有效的方法，也是在实际生活中不断地改进我们的干群关系的一个极其有效的方法。
    在1957年整风运动开始时，党中央就曾发出指示，指出领导干部参加体力劳动的重要意义，并且把领导干部参加体力劳动，作为一项制度规定下来。党中央在关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示中这样地唤起全党同志注意：我们党在三十年来，同群众在一起，艰苦奋斗，赢得了伟大革命的胜利。现在我们面前的艰巨的任务，是要把我国建成为一个具有现代工业和现代农业的伟大社会主义国家。要实现这个任务，就必须继续发扬我们党联系群众、艰苦奋斗的传统。各级领导干部参加一部分体力劳动，使脑力劳动和体力劳动结合，就是发扬这个优良传统的一个制度，也是当前整风运动要求达到的一个目标。在此以后，中央又继续发出指示，要求各个部门中的各种干部，凡是能够参加体力劳动的，都必须毫无例外地参加体力劳动。
    全国广大干部用实际行动执行了党中央的这个指示：不仅利用业余时间参加体力劳动，而且分批地在一定时期内到农村或工厂中去参加劳动。干部下放到农村中，成为一个普通的公社社员，下放到工厂中，成为一个普通的工人。他们和其他社员、工人同吃、同住、同劳动，也同样地分担生产任务，同样地遵守劳动纪律。在军队中的干部，包括高级指挥员在内，也分批下放到连队中，当普通的士兵。在我们的广大干部中，参加体力劳动已经形成一种风气，并且采取了多种多样的形式。
    一年来的经验证明，干部、特别是领导干部参加体力劳动，对于克服脱离群众、脱离实际的主观主义、官僚主义作风，有十分显著的效果。许多干部反映，在参加了体力劳动之后，由于深入了实际，作为一个普通的劳动者置身于群众之中，干部和群众就更能相互了解，心心相印。一些过去不容易听到的事情听到了，一些过去不容易看到的事情看到了，群众在想什么，要求什么，能够及时地了解了。许多有关生产、工作和群众生活中的新问题，都能够较快地发现，及时地和群众商量，得到解决。干部有了实际参加生产的经验，对于领导生产工作和其他工作，也就做得更具体、更细致了。
    干部作风的改进，必然会反转来对广大群众发生重大的影响。旧社会中根深蒂固的轻视体力劳动的观点，和旧社会的官民对立的关系，在广大群众中留下了一定的影响，这种影响不是很容易就能扫除干净的。群众如果看到了有些干部作风上的某些缺点，就更有可能对于我们的干群关系发生错误的了解。一年来的经验证明，干部、特别是领导干部参加体力劳动，对于扫除群众中残存的对待体力劳动和干群关系的某些旧的看法，起了重大的作用。人民群众通过干部参加体力劳动的活生生的事实，进一步了解他们自己在国家中的主人翁地位，进一步正确地认识了干部与群众的关系。在许多公社和企业中，干部参加体力劳动，给了群众以很大的鼓舞，群众的生产积极性显著地提高，群众对于干部的信任和爱戴也大为增强。干部密切地联系群众，群众由衷地信任干部，在这样的基础上，形成干部和群众打成一片的局面，这是我们任何事业能够取得胜利的一个最根本的关键。
    干部参加体力劳动，不但在现时有重要意义，而且如前所说，在今后是一件长期的事情。我们的干部，既然是从群众中来的，他们就应当按照需要，随时回到群众中去，做一个普通的工人和农民。随着人民群众的文化水平、政治经验和共产主义思想觉悟日益普遍地提高，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别必将逐渐消除。因此，干部参加体力劳动，干部当工人，干部当农民，这样的制度，应当成为我们国家的一种根本制度，继续坚持下去。我们有了1958年的丰富经验，在1959年应当在总结已有经验的基础上，作出更好的安排，取得更好的成绩。
