　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Havana: The Cuban government is taking measures to further reduce the people's cost of living.

　　On the 6th, the Cuban cabinet passed a decree to lower rents. According to this decree, rents will be reduced by 30% to 50%. Prior to this, the government had already ordered American-operated telephone and power companies to reduce telephone and electricity rates.

　　In another decree issued by the cabinet on the same day, it was stipulated that 15% to 18% of alcohol should be mixed into gasoline in order to reduce the price of gasoline. This alcohol is extracted from Cuba's abundant sugarcane.

　　The Cuban Sugarcane Stabilization Bureau has been authorized to preserve 80 million gallons of sugarcane juice during this harvest season for the purpose of extracting alcohol.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Havana: The second-in-command of the former "Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities," Jose Castaño, was sentenced to death yesterday by the Cuban Revolutionary Military Tribunal. This criminal committed serious crimes such as plundering, abuse of torture, and murder.

　　The "Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities" was a reactionary organization established by the former dictatorial regime. It was under the direct command of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and specialized in the heinous crimes of murdering Cuban communists and patriots. The Cuban government had ordered the dissolution of this reactionary organization in February.

    内阁在同一天颁发的另一项法令，规定在汽油中渗入15％到18％的火酒以便降低汽油的价格。这种火酒是从古巴盛产的甘蔗中提炼的。

    新华社8日讯　哈瓦那消息：前“共产党活动镇压局”的第二号头目何塞·卡斯塔尼奥昨天被古巴革命军事法庭判处死刑。这个罪犯犯了掠夺、滥施苦刑和谋害人命等严重罪行。
    “共产党活动镇压局”是前独裁政权设立的一个反动机构。它受美国联邦调查局的直接指挥，专门从事杀害古巴共产党人和爱国人士的罪恶勾当。古巴政府曾在2月间下令解散这个反动机构。
