Title: Experts Should Learn from the Masses, and the Masses Should Learn from Experts

    Science is nothing more than systematized knowledge. However, if one possesses only systematic written knowledge of a certain science, but lacks practical experience, and therefore cannot independently think about or handle problems arising in this area, then one cannot be considered an expert.

    Since science is systematized knowledge, if we understand the source of knowledge, we can understand the relationship between experts and the masses more clearly.

    Knowledge is a product of society, not an individual product. It is held by the masses. People living social lives acquire various experiences through various social activities, primarily productive labor, and the ideas and concepts reflecting objective reality are exchanged and promoted among them, thus becoming knowledge recorded in memory or in books. Each individual possesses a portion of knowledge, but it is far less abundant than the total knowledge of the masses. Experts can only absorb knowledge from the masses, integrate and refine it to become systematic scientific knowledge, and then become scientific experts.

    However, conversely, the masses also rely on experts. The masses are essentially a collection of individuals. If some individuals among them concentrate their efforts on studying certain natural science problems, devote great energy, absorb the knowledge of the masses, and vigorously refine and think, then they will undoubtedly know more and have more methods to solve problems than some other people. It is unreasonable to say that an individual who has undergone long-term refinement has less knowledge or is more blind and ignorant than an individual who has not undergone refinement or is young. To put it extremely: truly good experts, through arduous study and practice, discover some truths and grasp some laws that predecessors have not discovered. For example, they discover that matter has no beginning and no end, is in eternal motion, that species are derived and evolved from primitive ancestors, and that consciousness is determined by existence, and so on. Then, these truths are not "believe it or not," but "you can't help but believe it." If you don't believe it today, you will have to believe it after a process of understanding. At this point, the reasoning is very clear: if experts have true knowledge and insight, we must consult them. They pass on true knowledge to everyone, and through mutual learning and dissemination, it becomes the knowledge of the masses again, increasing the wealth of social knowledge. Therefore, experts should learn from the masses, and the masses should also learn from experts.

    There is an old saying in my hometown: "When the water rises, the boat floats higher." This saying can also be applied to the relationship between the masses and experts. To develop science in the country, we must also cultivate the masses and continuously improve their level. If one day all Chinese people have a college degree, or even a graduate degree after five or six years of postgraduate study, then the level of experts at that time will inevitably be many times higher than it is today. There is no doubt about this.

    The reader may have a question at this point: When everyone has the level of today's experts, or is many times higher than the level of today's highest experts, will there still be so-called experts and masses with these names and distinctions? This question is very pertinent. It is inevitable that everyone will become multi-faceted talents in the future. But if differences still exist between individuals, and some are still more diligent, more persevering, more persistent, and have better memory, then it is still possible for some people to have special expertise in certain areas, at least within a certain historical period.

    The meaning I am trying to convey in this short article is very simple. It is just to say that the knowledge of experts comes from the practice of the masses. If the mass base is wider and absorbs more knowledge from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, the knowledge of experts will be wider and higher. But experts not only absorb knowledge but also practice, and through personal efforts, they will have new inventions and discoveries. Therefore, experts and the masses should respect each other and learn from each other. We must emphasize that the masses have extremely great wisdom and knowledge, and at the same time, we must reward individual efforts to study hard and move forward.

### 专家应当向群众学习群众也应当向专家学习

    专家应当向群众学习群众也应当向专家学习
    科学非他，只是系统化了的知识。但是如果对于某一门科学，只有了系统的书面知识，而缺乏实践，因此对于这一方面发生的问题不能独立思考，不能独立处理，这还不能算是专家。
    科学既是系统化了的知识，我们如果了解了知识的来源，对于专家与群众的关系，便能够知道得更清楚。
    知识是社会的产物，不是个人的产物。它掌握在群众手里。过着社会生活的人们，由于各种社会活动，首先是生产劳动，获得了各种经验，与反映客观现实所得的观念与概念，彼此互相交流与推广，遂成为知识而记在记忆中或记在书本上。各个个人虽都有一部分知识，但远不如群众全部知识那样丰富。专家只能从群众中吸取知识，加以融会与研磨，而成为系统的科学知识，随后成为一个科学专家。
    但是反过来，群众也依靠专家的。群众本是个人的集合体。如其中某些个人，集中精力，攻研某些自然科学的问题，付出极大的精力，吸收群众的知识，大力研磨与思索。之后，他比其他的一些人，会知道得更多些，解决问题的方法也多些。这是没有疑义的。如说久经研磨的个人，反比没有经过研磨的个人或年纪幼稚的个人，知识更少了，更其盲目无知了，这显然是没有理由的。形容得极端一点：真正好的专家，经过苦炼苦学，发现了一些真理，掌握一些前人未发现过的规律，比方说，他发现物质是无始无终的，是永恒运动的，物种是由原始的祖先递衍变化来的，以及意识是由存在决定的，等等。那么，这些真理不是“信不信由你”，而是“不由你不信”。今天不信，经过一个认识过程，以后还得相信。说到这里，道理已很明白了，专家如有真知灼见，我们还得向他请教。他把真知识传给大家，经过大家互相学习与传播，又成为群众的知识，增加了社会知识的财富。所以专家应当向群众学习，群众也应当向专家学习。
    故乡有句老话，叫做“水涨船高”。这句话也可以应用到群众与专家之间的关系上去。要使国内科学发达，还必须培养群众，使之程度不断地提高。中国人民，有一天全都有大学毕业的程度，以至于皆有毕业后经过五、六年钻研的研究生的程度，那时候的专家的程度，必然比今日的要高很多倍，这是无可怀疑的。
    读者至此也许要发生疑问：到了大家都有今日专家的程度，或者比今日程度最高的专家还要高出多少倍，那时候是否还有所谓专家与群众这名称和区别？这个问题提得很对。将来大家都将成为多面手的能手是必然的事情。但如果各个人之间仍存在着差别，仍然有的勤奋些，坚忍些，有恒心些，博闻强记些，那么，某些人对于某些方面特别专长些，也还是可能的，至少在一定历史时期内是如此。
    我在这篇短文里所讲的意思十分简单。只是说专家的知识都是从群众实践中来的，如果群众基础愈广，吸收古今中外的知识愈多，专家的知识便愈广，愈高。但专家除吸取知识之外还有实践，经过个人的努力，还会有新的发明与发现。所以专家与群众应当互相尊重，互相学习。我们要着重说明群众有极多的智慧与知识，同时也要奖励个人努力钻研，努力前进。
