    Guangnan Zhuang and Miao Nationalities Vigorously Develop Oil Crops

    (Our dispatch) Yunnan Province, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guangnan County, is vigorously developing woody oil crops that do not compete with grain and cotton land, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in oil and support cities. As of now, the county has planted more than 1.5 million mu of oil tea and tung trees, more than 100 times more than before 1958. Including herbaceous oil crops, the county is expected to produce 7.38 million jin of oil this year, an average of 22 jin of oil per person. By 1967, the total tea oil production in the county will reach more than 300 million jin, an average of 1,000 jin of vegetable oil per person. This will not only fully meet the edible needs of the people of all ethnic groups in the county, but also transfer a large amount of tea oil to support national construction. Farmers' incomes will also greatly increase.

    Now, all communes are strengthening the cultivation of young forests. Next year, relying on these young forests and continuing to plant some peanuts, the county's edible oil problem can be solved, and a portion can also be transferred out.

    广南僮族苗族大力发展油料作物
    本报讯　云南省文山僮族苗族自治州广南县大力发展不与粮棉争地的木本油料作物，争取做到油料自给和支援城市。到目前为止，全县已种下油茶、油桐等一百五十多万亩，较1958年以前扩大一百多倍。加上草本油料作物，预计全县今年内可产油七百三十八万斤，平均每人有油二十二斤。到1967年，全县茶油总产量将达到三亿多斤，平均每人有植物油一千斤。不仅可以充分满足本县各族人民的食用需要，而且可以调出大量茶油支持国家建设。农民的收入也将大大增加。
    现在，各公社正加强幼林培育工作。明年，依靠这些幼林和继续种点花生，就可以解决全县的食油问题，同时还可以外调一分部。
