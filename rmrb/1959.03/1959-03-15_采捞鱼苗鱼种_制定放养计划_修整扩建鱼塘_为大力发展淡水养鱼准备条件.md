Collecting Fish Fry and Fingerlings, Formulating Stocking Plans, Repairing and Expanding Fish Ponds
Preparing Conditions for Vigorously Developing Freshwater Fish Farming

    This newspaper reports that in order to greatly develop fish farming, various regions are now launching a spring production upsurge centered on vigorously developing fish fry and fingerlings.
    Under the new situation of implementing a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, this year's aquaculture industry has seen even greater development. For example, Anhui Province plans to expand its breeding area from 6.5 million mu last year to 13 million mu this year, with planned fish production increasing from 4.2 million tons to 7 million tons. Many regions have massively transformed water surfaces; not only are lakes, reservoirs, ponds, and paddy fields being used for fish farming, but even inland saltwater lakes and factory cooling ponds are being prepared for fish farming, achieving full utilization of water resources. People's communes in various regions, in accordance with the production policy of comprehensive development and diversified operations, have unified the allocation of labor and funds, ensuring that fish farming plans are thoroughly implemented. Many regions have also established specialized teams for aquatic production. The Liuge People's Commune in Hanchuan, Hubei, following the spirit of unified leadership and management at different levels, has arranged more than 1,500 aquatic production personnel and 62 professional teams from the commune to the production team, and has also implemented a management responsibility system of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing output, guaranteeing work, and guaranteeing quality), "two fixings" (fixing work points and fixing rewards and punishments), and "five to the pond" (output to the pond, number of fingerlings stocked to the pond, feed formulation to the pond, management responsibility to the pond, and technical measures to the pond).
    Vigorously developing fish fry and fingerlings is a crucial measure for developing the aquaculture industry. The Ministry of Aquatic Products has proposed that this year's fingerling target requires reaching nearly 100 billion. To welcome the spring fish fry season, various regions have made relatively full preparations for the artificial incubation and collection of fish fry in advance, adding many seines and baskets, opening up many new wharves for catching fish fry along rivers with abundant fish, and, in conjunction with farmland water conservancy construction, newly opened many fingerling ponds. Hunan Province plans to add more than 45,000 new seines, and is close to completing all of them. Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, has not only repaired more than 500 old baskets, but also woven more than 1,000 new baskets.
    Currently, the intense work of collecting natural fish fry is gradually unfolding. Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang, organized a fishing army of more than 37,000 people, equipped with many tractors, automobiles, rubber-wheeled carts, and ice sleds, and worked hard for more than 50 days, collecting and transporting a total of 1.15 billion natural fingerlings and 290,000 parent fish. Anhui's aquatic production team of more than 60,000 people, while catching adult fish, has captured more than 5 billion natural fingerlings and more than 600,000 parent fish. While expanding fish fingerling production, various regions are paying particular attention to increasing the proportion of artificial incubation in order to make fingerling work perennial. Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan, requires every county to have artificial incubation stations for silver carp and bighead carp, and every commune and production team to have artificial incubation farms for carp, and is focusing on Wugang, Xiangxiang, and Shaodong counties as key areas, allocating more than 14,000 yuan for pilot projects.
    In order to solve the problem of tight feed supply in the great development of the aquaculture industry, most regions have paid attention to this work and have taken corresponding measures, such as using green manure, manure fertilizer, and sewage to cultivate larvae, and implementing a three-way combination of pig farming, vegetable planting, and fish farming by lakes and ponds. Shunde Prefecture, Guangdong, plans to use 150,000 mu of water surface that cannot be used for fish farming to cultivate water hyacinth for fish farming. Zhejiang Province has also allocated 400,000 mu of water surface specifically for cultivating feed. Hebei Province is also preparing to use methods such as breeding earthworms, using lights to trap insects, and using canteen sewage to solve the problem of insufficient feed. Coastal provinces are preparing to use large quantities of low-economic-value shellfish and algae as feed.
    Currently, the masses in various regions are combining large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer production, and are seizing the time to carry out the cleaning and consolidation of lakes and ponds, preparing to welcome stocking. For example, Hubei has invested a large amount of labor to repair, expand, and newly dig many ponds and weirs in conjunction with repairing river embankments, engaging in farmland water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, and opening up transportation. The Fifth Production Team of the Garden Farm in this province combined fertilizer accumulation with digging 14 mu of ponds and carrying 80 loads of pond fertilizer, which not only saved more than 1,000 labor forces, but also increased a lot of fertilizer. Chao'an County, Guangdong, combined deep plowing and soil improvement with comprehensive planning, organized more than 13,000 people, and launched a ten-day blitz, deepening more than 1,400 mu of fish ponds and eliminating shallow ponds. While cleaning up fish ponds, some areas that have taken action earlier have begun stocking. The Meihuaying District Production Team of the Hongchao Commune in Chaoyang County, Guangdong, "digged mud, tidied up, and sowed seeds at the same time" in more than 300 mu of large fish ponds, and has already stocked more than 700,000 fingerlings in the repaired and watered ponds.

    采捞鱼苗鱼种　制定放养计划　修整扩建鱼塘
    为大力发展淡水养鱼准备条件
    本报讯　为大量发展养鱼，各地现正开展一个以大搞鱼苗鱼种为中心的春季生产高潮。
    在实行农林牧副渔全线大革命的新形势下，今年的水产养殖事业有了更大的发展。如安徽省今年的养殖面积准备由去年的六百五十万亩扩大到一千三百万亩，计划产鱼四百二十万吨到七百万吨。很多地区大规模地改造了水面；不仅湖泊、水库、池塘、稻田利用起来进行养鱼，连内陆咸水湖、工厂冷却池也准备养鱼，做到水水皆利用。各地人民公社根据全面发展、多种经营的生产方针，统一安排了劳力和资金，使养鱼规划落底落实。很多地区还建立了水产生产的专门班子。湖北汉川刘隔人民公社按照统一领导分级管理的精神，从公社到生产队共安排了水产生产人员一千五百多人，专业队六十二个，并且推行了“三包”（包产、包工、包质量）“两定”（定工分、定奖惩）“五到塘”（产量到塘、鱼种投放尾数到塘、饲料配合到塘、管理责任到塘、技术措施到塘）的管理责任制。
    大搞鱼苗鱼种是发展养殖事业的关键性的措施。水产部提出今年的鱼种指标要求达到近一千亿尾。为了迎接春季鱼苗汛期，各地对鱼苗的人工孵化和采捞事先都作了较充分的准备，新增了不少绠网、篓，在盛产鱼的江河沿岸新辟了不少捕捞鱼苗的埠头，同时结合农田水利的建设，新开了不少鱼种池。湖南全省计划新添的四万五千多部新绠，目前已接近全部完成。广东省东莞县目前除修好五百多个旧箩外，还增织了一千多个新箩。
    现在，紧张的采捕天然鱼苗的工作正在逐步展开。黑龙江肇源县组织了三万七千多人的渔业大军，配备了许多拖拉机、汽车、胶轮大车、冰橇，苦干了五十多天，共采运了天然鱼种十一亿五千万尾，亲鱼二十九万尾。安徽六万多人的渔业专队，在捕捞成鱼的同时，已捕得天然鱼种五十多亿尾，亲鱼六十多万尾。各地在扩大鱼种生产的同时，特别注意提高人工孵化的比重，以做到苗种工作常年化。湖南邵阳专区今年要求县县有鲢、鳙鱼人工孵化站，社社队队有鲤鱼人工孵化场，并以武岗、湘乡、邵东三县为重点，拨款一万四千多元进行试点。
    为解决养殖事业大发展中饵料紧张的问题，大部分地区都已重视这一工作，并采取了相应的措施，如用绿肥、粪肥和污水培养幼虫，以及在湖边、塘边实行养猪、种菜、养鱼三结合等办法。广东顺德专区计划利用不能养鱼的十五万亩水面培植水浮莲养鱼。浙江省也划出了四十万亩水面专门培殖饵料。河北省还准备用繁殖蚯蚓、灯光诱捕昆虫、食堂污水等办法来解决饵料不足。沿海各省准备利用大量的经济价值低的贝、藻类作饵料。
    现在，各地群众正结合大兴水利、大搞肥料，抓紧进行湖塘的清整工作，准备迎接放养。如湖北各地都已投入大批劳力，与修江堤搞农田水利、积肥、开辟交通等结合，整修、扩建、新挖了许多塘堰。这个省花园农场第五生产队结合积肥挖了十四亩塘，挑了八十担塘肥，不仅节省了一千多个劳动力，还增加了许多肥料。广东潮安县结合深翻改土，进行全面规划，组织了一万三千多人，突击十天，挖深鱼塘一千四百余亩，消灭了浅水塘。在清整鱼塘的同时，一些行动较早的地区，已开始了放苗工作。广东潮阳县红潮公社梅花营区生产队在三百多亩大鱼塘中，“边挖泥、边整理、边落种”，在修整灌水的塘里，已经放下了七十多万尾鱼种。（附图片）
