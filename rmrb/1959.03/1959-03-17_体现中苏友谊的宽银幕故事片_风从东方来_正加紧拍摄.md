The jointly produced Sino-Soviet color wide-screen feature film "The Wind from the East," with the theme of Sino-Soviet friendship, has begun filming. Members of the Sino-Soviet joint film crew are working intensively in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places with the highest degree of enthusiasm. They are determined to ensure that audiences in China and the Soviet Union see this film during the tenth anniversary of our National Day.

The film is co-directed by Comrade Gigan, the Soviet chief director, and Comrade Yu Xuewei, the Chinese chief director. Comrade Gigan is an Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and a recipient of the Stalin Prize.

Relevant departments in both China and the Soviet Union attach great importance to this collaboration. The General Editor of the Soviet Film Production Administration, Comrade Chekin, was specially sent to China by the Administration to discuss relevant issues. Premier Zhou Enlai of our country received Comrade Chekin on the 14th and encouraged all members of the film crew to complete the film's production according to plan.

This film mainly depicts: In the old Tsarist era, Chinese worker Wang Demin worked as a miner in Russia. During the October Revolution, the Red Army rescued him, and he also joined the Red Army, forging a life-and-death friendship with Red Army soldier Matveyev. They fought alongside each other against the White bandits and later participated in voluntary labor together, even serving as guards for Lenin. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, Wang Demin returned to China and worked as a director at a construction site. Matveyev was also sent to China to help with construction. At the construction site, they once again fought against floods and finally overcame them. Matveyev is played by the famous Soviet actor and Honored Artist of Russia, I. Dmitriev; Wang Demin is played by Chinese actor Tian Fang (the young Wang Demin is played by Ma Jingwu, a student at the Beijing Film Academy). The film also features the image of Comrade Lenin, played by Russian People's Artist Mikhail Kondratiev, who has played Lenin many times on stage and screen.
