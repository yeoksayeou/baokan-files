Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 2nd. Recently, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region dispatched a batch of cadres to commune canteens to serve as cooks. According to statistics from Luocheng, Mubi, Chongzuo, Fusui, Mashan, Wuming, Yishan, Huanjiang and other counties, each county sent five to seven hundred cadres to work as cooks in commune canteens.

Among these dispatched cadres were county party secretaries, county heads, and commune party secretaries. They appeared entirely as ordinary laborers, doing everything from cooking rice and stir-frying dishes to sweeping the floor, lighting the fire, and serving tea. At the same time, they also helped arrange a series of tasks such as planned grain consumption and non-staple food production, which rapidly improved the work of many public canteens. Li Jingting, the Yishan County Party Secretary, who was sent to the Pantang Public Canteen of the Xingfu Commune as a cook, worked diligently from early morning until late at night. With his help, the canteen adopted a method of planned grain consumption based on per capita quotas, saving more than 1,000 jin of grain each month. They also regularly announced the menu and solicited opinions from commune members, making the variety of dishes and meals more diverse. More than 500 cadres dispatched to Mashan County as cooks worked while gaining an in-depth understanding of the situation among the masses, helping to rectify and consolidate the canteens. They organized general canteen staff to discuss certain problems existing in the canteen work, formulated several canteen work systems, and purged landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements who had infiltrated the canteens, equipping Party and League members and activists to take on the work of cooks. As a result, all 1,724 canteens in the county were universally consolidated and improved in a short period of time.

    广西一批干部到公社当炊事员
    边劳动边整顿巩固食堂
    新华社南宁2日电　广西僮族自治区最近下放一批干部到公社食堂担任炊事员。据罗城、睦边、崇左、扶绥、马山、武鸣、宜山、环江等县统计，下放到公社食堂当炊事员的干部各有五百到七百名。
    在这些下放干部中有县委书记、县长、公社党委书记等。他们完全以普通劳动者的姿态出现，不论煮饭、炒菜、扫地、烧火、送茶，样样都干；同时还帮助安排了计划用粮、副食品生产等一系列的工作，使许多公共食堂的工作迅速提高。下放到幸福公社畔塘公共食堂当炊事员的中共宜山县委书记李景亭，每天都起早睡晚，辛勤劳动。在他的帮助下，这个食堂采取按人定量计划用粮的办法，每月节约粮食一千多斤。他们并定期公布菜饭单，征求社员意见，使饭菜的花样品种做到多种多样。马山县下放当炊事员的五百多名干部，一面劳动，一面深入群众了解情况，帮助整顿巩固食堂。他们就食堂工作中存在的某些问题，组织一般食堂工作人员进行讨论，制订了若干食堂工作制度，并清除了混进食堂的地主、富农和坏分子，配备了党、团员和积极分子担任炊事员工作。这样，全县一千七百二十四个食堂，在短期内都普遍得到了巩固和提高。
