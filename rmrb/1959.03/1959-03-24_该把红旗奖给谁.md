Who Should Get the Red Flag Award?
By our correspondent Fu Dong

Zhang Xiang led his team, heading towards Chengzi Mine with great enthusiasm. Passing the club, they heard the sounds of gongs and drums. Today's opera was excellent: "Eighteen Arhats Fighting the Monkey King," and a "Tale of Demon Subjugation"; but who had the mind to watch the opera? There was a fierce battle waiting for them underground! Today, they were competing with Team Fifteen in opening a tunnel.

A young man said as they walked, "Our Rock Excavation Team Four is one of the best in the whole mine. Last year we defeated the famous Wanfotang Excavation Team, so this time we must not let Team Fifteen take the Red Flag." Another young man said, "Yesterday, when we held a meeting to discuss the competition, the people from Team Fifteen heard about it, and they were not convinced. Someone said to me: 'Don't be happy too soon, we'll have a good contest this time!'. It seems that they are very eager. Comrades, the Red Flag represents our achievements over the past few years, so this time we must get it." As they spoke, they unknowingly reached the mine entrance. Everyone got up early today, but when they arrived at the rest room, they saw that the comrades of Team Fifteen were already there. Everyone chatted and laughed, and in the blink of an eye, they were down to the underground, two hundred and thirty meters below the surface, in the cage.

Everything had been decided. The twenty-seven-meter-long tunnel was to be divided in half: Team Four would excavate from north to south, and Team Fifteen would dig from south to north; a mark was made in the middle, and whoever reached it first would win.

Team Four was full of experienced workers, with nimble hands and feet. They had been underground for less than ten minutes, and they had already set up the rock drill架子, water truck, wind belt, and water belt, almost twice as fast as usual.

Chen Daqing, the leader of the drilling team, came up with a good method. Before going into battle, he said to his partners: "How about we use a long drill bit today? This way we can drill deeper, and only need to drill five holes per cubic meter. If we calculate it, we can drill eight meters in eight hours, then we will definitely be able to beat Team Fifteen." The drillers all agreed.

Everyone's enthusiasm was really high, each one like a little tiger. In the past, it was good to drill a two-meter-deep hole in twenty minutes, but now they were drilling one in fifteen minutes, and it was much deeper than before.

The workers who supported the frame and transported the stones were also competing with each other. In the past, it took five minutes to transport a car of stones, but now the workers were like eagles with wings, flying straight forward, and in the blink of an eye, it was a car.

Team Four had finished drilling the holes and were about to set off the explosives. Someone ran to Team Fifteen to take a look. Oh no, they were far behind! What to do? It had been agreed that the two teams should set off the explosives together. Setting off the explosives once would stop work for half an hour; setting them off separately would delay it by another ten or twenty minutes. After some discussion, they decided: drill the holes deeper, up to four meters deep, and wait for Team Fifteen to finish drilling their holes and set off the explosives together.

Team Fifteen's holes were shallow, only one meter seven or eight; they added a little effort, drilled all the holes, and were ready to set off the explosives. But at this time, Team Four was still drilling holes and had to wait half an hour before they could set off the explosives. Team Fifteen couldn't wait and wanted to set them off first, so they came to discuss it with Team Four. When the young men of Team Four heard about it, some of them were unwilling. They said to the squad leader behind their backs: "No way, we already gave in to them just now, so they should wait for us this time. If they set them off first and work fast, won't the Red Flag be taken away?"

"Comrades, that's not right! What are we competing for?" Zhang Xiang pointed to the tunnel and said, "Look, this narrow road is so delayed! The coal carts on the double track get stuck here, and they have to wait for more than ten minutes, sometimes an hour. The trolley driver complains all day long: 'A lot of coal has been produced, but not much has been transported out. The cars are moving too slowly in and out. It's really frustrating!' Comrades, think about it, is it better to widen the road and transport more coal sooner, or later?"

Zhang Xiang paused here for a while, and then said, "Comrades, think about it again, what is Team Fifteen like to us? When we were digging the slope last September and October, people from Team Fifteen came to help us transport the winch pipes, and they worked harder than they did in their own team. In November, when they saw that we were busy, they took the initiative to come to us and said, "Whatever you need, we'll give you. If you need people, we'll give you people. If you need tools, we'll give you tools." When they saw that we didn't have enough air hammers, they immediately sent theirs over. In fact, they didn't have any to spare. Look, how noble their style is!"

These words touched everyone's hearts. Everyone recalled that, indeed, Team Fifteen had no selfishness. As soon as they had figured out some good methods for tunneling, they immediately told Team Four, without any reservations. Thinking about it this way, everyone's minds cleared up, and they said: "In order to complete the task ahead of schedule and get the mine to produce more coal, let Team Fifteen set off the explosives first!" Saying that, they withdrew from the tunnel.

The next shift was Cheng Yishun's shift. The young men in this shift were even more "energetic". They were previously the mine's youth commando team, each one strong and sturdy, full of fire. When they went down the well, they didn't say a word, they picked up their tools and started working. They set off the explosives twice, and they were almost at the dividing line. The "problem" came: if they drilled four meters deep as before, they would cross the dividing line and go to Team Fifteen's side. Some people disagreed with drilling for Team Fifteen, and they said:
"We have already yielded to Team Fifteen twice. Zhang Xiang's shift yielded once, and we just let them set off the explosives first. That's enough for friends. Besides, the shed on our side has not been built yet, and saving some effort, let's do our own first, otherwise we won't get the Red Flag." Some others did not agree with this statement, they said: "What kind of tune is this singing! Our competition is not the same as the competition in capitalist countries! We are not competing for who beats whom, but for exchanging experiences, learning from each other, improving each other, and pushing production forward!" In just a few words, the other party had nothing to say. In this way, they decided to drill deep holes as before, and drill three meters more for Team Fifteen. The squad leader encouraged everyone: "No one can slack off. After completing the task, we will go to help Team Fifteen."

Team Four was about to complete the task, but Team Fifteen was far behind. Some people in Team Fifteen were panicking, but the squad leader said calmly, "Panicking is useless, let's try harder."

The people of Team Four were happily erecting the last frame, but they knew that there was a stone on the side that was holding it up, the frame was not stable, so they had to tear it down and re-erect it; it didn't work when it was erected again, so they tore it down and re-erected it again; after tossing back and forth three times, it still didn't meet the standards, so there was no way, they had to set off the explosives to blow up the stone.

At this moment, Team Fifteen quietly caught up and quickly erected the last frame. After finishing their work, they happily ran over to help Team Four erect the frame.

The task of two days was completed in just one day. Team Fifteen finished first, and it seemed that the Red Flag was going to be awarded to Team Fifteen. Not a single person in Team Four said anything strange; when they left the well, they found that two of Team Fifteen's column sockets were not deep enough, and they also thought of replacing two shed legs for them.

The leadership gave the Red Flag to Team Fifteen. But the workers of Team Fifteen said that they didn't want it, they said they felt guilty for taking it. Team Four had helped them so much, and based on cooperation alone, the Red Flag should be given to Team Four. But the workers of Team Four kept saying that it was only natural for the Red Flag to be given to Team Fifteen.

Who should the Red Flag be given to after all? Even the leaders were in a dilemma. (Picture attached)

    该把红旗奖给谁
    本报记者　傅冬
    张祥带着他那一班人马，兴冲冲地朝城子矿走去。走过俱乐部，只听见里面锣鼓喧天。今天的戏真不错：“十八罗汉斗悟空”，还有一出“斩魔记”；可是谁有心思去看戏，井下有一场激战正等着他们哩！他们今天要和十五组比赛开巷道。
    一个小伙子边走边说：“咱们岩石掘进四组，在全矿都是数一数二的，去年战胜了全矿鼎鼎大名的万佛堂掘进组，这次无论如何不能叫十五组把红旗夺走”。另一个小伙子说：“昨天咱们开会讨论竞赛，叫十五组的人听到了，他们不服气。有人对我说：你们别高兴得太早了，咱们这次得好好较量较量！看样子，火气很重。同志们，红旗标志着咱们几年来的成绩，这次无论如何也要拿到手。”说着走着不觉间就到了井口。今天大伙起了个早，那知到了休息室一看，十五组的同志们早已来了。大家说说笑笑，坐上罐笼转眼工夫，就下到离地二百三十公尺的地下。
    一切都说好了，二十七公尺长的道儿，一组一半：四组由北向南开，十五组由南向北掘；中间作了个记号，谁先到谁得胜。
    四组净是些老手，手脚麻利。他们到井底下没十分钟，就把风镐架子、水车、风带、水带安顿停当了，比平时差不多快了一倍。
    钻工组的组长陈大清想出了好法儿，上阵前他对他的伙伴说：“咱们今天用长钎打眼好不好？这样打得深，一立方只要打五个眼，算下来，八个钟头能打八公尺，那咱们就准能胜过十五组。”钻工们听了，个个都赞成。
    大伙的干劲真足，一个个像小老虎似的。以前二十分钟打一个两公尺深的眼子就算不错了，现在十五分钟就打一个，还比过去深得多。
    支架子和运石头的工人也是一个赛过一个。以前运一车石头要五分钟，现在工人们简直像长着翅膀的鹰，向前直飞，一眨眼就是一车。
    四组打好了眼，就要放炮了。有人跑到十五组一看，糟糕，他们还差得远哩！怎么办？原先说好的，两组最好一齐放炮。放一次炮得停工半个多钟头；分开放，又要多耽搁一、二十分钟。大家一商量，这样吧：把眼子再打深一些，打到四公尺深，等十五组打好眼一齐放炮。
    十五组的眼打得浅，只一公尺七、八；他们加了把劲，打齐了眼，可以放炮了。可是这时四组仍在打眼，要等半个钟头才能放。十五组等不及，想先放，来和四组商量。四组的小伙子知道了，有些人不乐意，他们背后对班长说：“不行，咱们刚才让了他们，他们这会也该等咱们。要是他们先放，干得快，红旗不就夺去了吗？”
    “同志们，这话说得不对呀！我们竞赛是为了什么呀？”张祥指着巷道说：“你们瞧，这条窄道多耽误事！双轨道上的煤车，一到这里就卡住了，一等就是十几分钟，有时要等个把钟头。管电车的司机一天到晚嘴里嘟嚷：‘煤倒生产了不少，就是运出去的不多。车子出来进去走得实在太慢了。真急死人！’同志们想想看，是早一天把道开宽多运出些煤好，还是晚一天好？”
    张祥说到这里，停了一会，接着又说：“同志们，你们再想想看，人家十五组对咱们是什么样儿？去年9、10月间咱们打斜坡的时候，十五组来人帮咱们运绞车管子，他们比在自己组里干活还卖力。11月，他们见咱们忙，又主动找上门说：“你们要什么，我们给什么，要人给人，要工具给工具。”他们见咱们风锤不够用，马上就把他们的送来。实际上，他们也没有富余的。你们看，他们的风格多高！”
    这一番话，打动了大伙的心。大伙回想了一下，可不是，十五组没私心，他们刚刚摸索出一些掘进的好法儿，马上就告诉四组，一点不存私。这么一想，大伙脑子清醒了，说：“为了提前完成任务，叫矿上多出煤，请十五组先放炮吧！”说着就退出了巷道。
    下一班，是程义顺班。这一班的小伙子更“冲”。他们先前是矿上的青年突击队，一个个身强力壮，浑身似火。他们下了井，一句话没说，拿起工具就干。他们放了两次炮，就快到分界线了。“难题”来了：要是像以前那样再打四公尺深的眼，就会打过分界线，到十五组那边去了。有人不同意给十五组打，他们说：
  “咱们已经让十五组两次了，张祥班让了一次，刚才咱们又让他们先放了一次。这也算够朋友了。再说我们这边的棚子还没有搭好，省下点功夫，咱们还是先弄弄自己的，不然拿不到红旗了。”另一些人不赞成这种说法，他们说：“这唱的是什么调！咱们的竞赛可不是资本主义国家的竞争呀！咱们并不是为了谁打败谁，而是为了交流经验，互相学习，互相提高，把生产向前推进一步！”简单几句话，对方就没话说了。就这样，他们决定照旧打深眼，给十五组打三公尺多。班长给大伙鼓劲说：“谁也不能松劲，完成任务，咱们去帮十五组。”
    四组眼看就要完工了，而十五组还差一大截。十五组有些人心里发慌，班长不慌不忙地说：“着慌没用，再努把力看看。”
    四组的人兴高采烈地架着最后一架棚子，那知道旁面有块石头顶着，棚子站不稳，只好拆了重架；架起来又不行，又拆了再架；这样翻来复去折腾了三次，还是不合格，没办法，只好放炮，把石头炸了。
    就在这时，十五组却不声不响地追了上来，很快搭起了最后一架棚子。他们收拾完活，高高兴兴地跑过来帮四组架棚子。
    两天的任务只用一天便完成了。十五组完工在前，看样子，红旗是要发给十五组了。四组没有一个人说怪话；他们离开井下时，发现十五组有两个柱窝打得不够深，还想法给换了两根棚子腿。
    领导上把红旗给了十五组。可是十五组的工人说什么也不要，他们说拿了心里有愧，四组帮了他们那么多忙，光凭协作这一点，红旗也应该给四组。可是四组的工人一个劲地说，红旗给十五组，理所当然。
    红旗到底该给谁呢？连领导上也为难了。（附图片）
