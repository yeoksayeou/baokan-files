    Reading and Bookishness
    Ma Tieding
    Bookworms are naturally people who have read a few books, but not everyone who has read books is a bookworm. If you are afraid of becoming a bookworm and simply don't read, that is like throwing away food because you fear choking.
    Beijing is currently staging the Peking Opera "Battle of Red Cliffs." There are many important roles in "Battle of Red Cliffs" that are scholars: some are bookworms, but more are not.
    Jiang Gan is a bookworm type of person. He lacks training in sharp political struggles, and he sees political struggles as too simple. He doesn't sniff around and think things over when things happen, so he was fooled by Zhou Yu and fell for Zhou Yu's counter-espionage scheme.
    Kong Ming is also a scholar, but he is not dull. On the contrary, because he combines book knowledge with solving practical problems, book knowledge makes him smarter and more capable; his judgment and analysis of problems are more accurate and profound. He is a scholar, but he directly opposes bookish habits. In the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," in the episode "Zhuge Liang Debates the Confucian Scholars, and Lu Zijing Persuades the Masses," Kong Ming had a dialogue: "There is a distinction between Confucian gentlemen and petty men... As for petty Confucian scholars, they only engage in carving insects, specializing in calligraphy and painting, composing poems in their youth, and exhausting scriptures in their old age. Although they have thousands of words under their pens, they have no strategies in their minds."
    The Confucian gentlemen that Kong Ming speaks of are those who have the ability to handle affairs and can connect with reality; the petty Confucian scholars that Kong Ming speaks of are bookworms who "have no strategies in their minds."
    Will reading detach you from reality? There are two answers: it can detach you from reality, or it can connect you more closely with reality and generate a strong interest in it.
    If you read books rigidly, get stuck in books and can't get out, and solve problems from concepts, then you will become a bookworm; if you read books flexibly, start from reality, and creatively apply book knowledge in real life, then book knowledge will make you smarter and more capable.
    What is book knowledge? Generally speaking, book knowledge is the understanding of real life by predecessors or others; it is the summary of the experience of predecessors or others in real life. Of course, these understandings and summaries are both correct and incorrect, but knowing these will make you see the real life you have personally experienced more deeply and clearly. Because there is a comparison, it is easier for your own analysis and judgment. Gorky said it well: "I read many books with excitement and surprise, but these books did not detach me from reality, but strengthened my interest in reality, improved my ability to observe and compare, and ignited my desire for knowledge of life." (Selected Literary Essays, page 156)
    Without practical life knowledge, or with very poor practical life knowledge, things cannot be done well. This is one aspect. On the other hand, due to the limitations of each person's energy and time, the life that an individual can personally experience is always limited. He cannot experience all life, so he needs to use the life experience of his predecessors, or the life experience of others, to supplement his own shortcomings. Predecessors have died and cannot be pulled out of their graves; the living experience of others cannot be directly taught to each person. This requires relying on books, relying on written records and dissemination. Our knowledge is constantly enriched from our own life experiences, from books, from perceptual knowledge, and from rational knowledge. Satisfying oneself with book knowledge is one-sided, and satisfying oneself with narrow life experience is also one-sided.
    Stalin, when talking about proletarian leaders, said this:
    "There have been some proletarian leaders in history, leaders in stormy periods, activist-style leaders, who are selfless and courageous, but they are theoretically weak. ...
    "There are also leaders, namely, leaders in peaceful periods, who are theoretically quite strong, but they are weak in organizational work and practical work." (Lenin as Organizer and Leader of the Russian Communist Party)
    Stalin believed that: Lenin possessed both a solid theoretical foundation and rich practical work experience.
    We should learn from revolutionary leaders and strive to have more practical work experience and a better theoretical foundation. This is entirely possible. In recent years, especially since the comprehensive and national Great Leap Forward that began last year, we have made great progress in going deep into life and deep into reality. This is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. Needless to say, in this regard, we must further implement it to the end and persevere unremittingly. However, in terms of seriously reading books, seriously studying Marxist-Leninist theory, and seriously inheriting and developing excellent cultural heritage, relatively speaking, not enough attention is paid to it. Theory comes from practical experience, which is of course correct, but some people misunderstand that practice is theory, which is not necessarily appropriate.
    While emphasizing going deep into reality and deep into life, breaking the concern that reading will lead to bookishness, and appropriately advocating seriously reading books, seriously studying Marxist-Leninism, and seriously inheriting and developing excellent cultural heritage seems necessary and timely - I think.

    读书和书呆子习气
    马铁丁
    书呆子自然总是读过几本书的人，但是，并非一切读过书的人都是书呆子。如果因为怕成书呆子就干脆不读书，那是因噎废食的想法。
    北京最近在演出京戏“赤壁之战”。“赤壁之战”中有许多重要角色是书生：其中有的是书呆子，更多的并不是书呆子。
    蒋干是个书呆子型的人，他缺乏在尖锐的政治斗争中的锻炼，又把政治斗争看得过分简单，没有遇事嗅一嗅，想一想，以致受了周瑜的愚弄，上了周瑜反奸计的大当。
    孔明也是一个读书人，可并不呆。正相反，由于他把书本知识和解决实际问题结合起来，书本知识使他更加聪明机智，更加具有办事的才能；对问题的判断和分析更加准确、深刻。他是一个读书人，却直接反对书呆子习气的。在“三国演义”“诸葛亮舌战群儒，鲁子敬力排众议”一回中，孔明曾有一段对话：“儒有君子小人之别……若夫小人之儒，惟务雕虫，专工翰墨，青春作赋，皓首穷经，笔下虽有千言，胸中实无一策”。
    孔明所说的君子之儒，就是那些有办事才能，能联系实际的人；孔明所说的小人之儒就是，“胸中实无一策”的书呆子。
    读书会脱离实际吗？答案有两个：可以脱离实际，也可以和实际联系得更加紧密，更加对实际发生浓郁的兴趣。
    如果死读书，钻在书本里爬不出来，解决问题从概念出发，那是会变为书呆子的；如果活读书，从实际出发，把书本知识在实际生活中作创造性的运用，那么书本知识会使人更加聪明、干练。
    书本知识是什么？一般地说，书本知识是前人或别人对现实生活的认识；是前人或别人在现实生活中的经验总结。当然这些认识和总结有正确的，也有不正确的，但知道这些，对自己所切身体验过的现实生活也就看得更加深刻和清楚。因为有个比较，更便于自己的分析和判断。高尔基说得好：“我兴奋地、惊异地阅读了许多书，但这些书并没有使我脱离现实，反而加强了我对于现实的兴趣，提高了观察、比较的能力，燃起了我对生活知识的渴望。”（文学论文选一百五十六页）
    没有实际的生活知识，或者实际的生活知识很贫乏，那是办不好事情的，这是一方面，还有另一方面，由于每个人的精力和时间的限制，个人所能亲身体验过的生活，总是有限度的，他不可能把一切生活都体验到，从而他需要借助前人的生活经验，或别人的生活经验，以补充自己的不足。前人已经死去，不可能把他们从坟墓里拉出来；别人的活生经验，也不可能一个个对自己当面传授，这就需要依靠书本，依靠文字的记载和传播。我们的知识，从切身的生活体验中，也从书本中，从感性知识中，也从理性知识中不断地丰富起来。满足于书本知识是片面的，满足于狭隘的生活经验也是片面的。
    斯大林在谈到无产阶级领袖的时候，有过这样的话：
    “历史上有过一些无产阶级的领袖，风暴时期的领袖，实行家式的领袖，他们是奋不顾身和见义勇为的，但他们在理论上却软弱无力。……
    “还有一种领袖，即和平时期的领袖，他们在理论上是颇有力量的，但他们在组织工作和实际工作方面却软弱无力。”（列宁是俄国共产党的组织者和领袖）
    斯大林认为：雄厚的理论素养和丰富的实际工作经验在列宁身上兼而有之。
    我们应当向革命领袖学习，力求自己有较多的实际工作经验，有较好的理论素养，这是完全可能办得到的。近几年来，特别是去年开始的全面、全民性的大跃进，在深入生活、深入实际方面，我们有了长足的进步，这是一个极为可喜的现象，不用说，在这方面，我们还要进一步贯彻到底、坚持不懈。但是，在认真读书、认真学习马克思列宁主义理论，认真继承和发扬优秀的文化遗产方面，比较地说来，是重视不够的。理论从实际经验中来，这当然是对的，有人误解为实际即理论，那就未必适当了。
    在强调深入实际、深入生活的同时，打破怕读书会成为书呆子的顾虑，适当提倡认真读书，认真学习马克思列宁主义，认真继承和发扬优秀的文化遗产，看来是必要的，也是切合时宜的——我以为。
