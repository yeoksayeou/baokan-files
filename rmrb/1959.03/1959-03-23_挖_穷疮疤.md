　　Digging Up "Poverty Scars"

　　When the de Gaulle government decided to take control of the French Mediterranean fleet itself, it argued plausibly: The British and American fleets have special relationships with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and they can freely use these fleets anywhere. For example, the American Sixth Fleet. Why can't France do this?

　　The United States and Britain were left speechless by this, and in their annoyance, they disregarded their gentlemanly demeanor and began to expose France's "poverty scars." One claim was that a large part of the French fleet was paid for by the United States or Britain. Another claim was that France has three aircraft carriers, two of which were given by the United States, and the third was a gift from Britain. The implication was that having given France money and ships, France and its fleet should be controlled and have no freedom.

　　But it seems that France, this "poor relative," is not so willing to remain in a position of humiliation. Those who dig up "poverty scars" inevitably also dig up the sore spots of those who sing the praises of "Atlantic solidarity."

    挖“穷疮疤”
    戴高乐政府决定自己掌管法国地中海舰队时，振振有词地辩解说：英国和美国的舰队跟北大西洋公约组织都有特殊的关系，他们可以自由的在任何地方使用这些舰队。譬如美国的第六舰队就是。为什么法国却不能这样做呢？
    美英对此无词以对，恼怒之余，顾不得绅士风度，揭起法国的“穷疮疤来”。一则说法国的舰队有很大一部分是美国或英国出的钱。再则说法国有三艘航空母舰，其中两艘是美国给的，第三艘是英国赠送的。这意思是，给了法国钱和舰只，法国和它的舰队就应受控制，不能有任何自由。
    但看来，法国这个“穷亲戚”并不那末甘居屈辱的地位。挖“穷疮疤”的人未免也挖了高唱“大西洋团结”的人自己的痛处。
