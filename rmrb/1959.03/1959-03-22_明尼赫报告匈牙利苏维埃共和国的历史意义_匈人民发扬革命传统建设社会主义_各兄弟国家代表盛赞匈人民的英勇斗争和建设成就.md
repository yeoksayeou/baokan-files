Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 20th. Minnih, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, delivered a report at the meeting held by the Hungarian National Assembly on the 20th to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

Minnih said that with the assistance of proletarian internationalist solidarity, our people have overcome the difficulties caused by the counter-revolution, and under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, are resolutely and unswervingly building socialism. The accelerated development of our socialist construction work proves more powerfully than anything else that the Hungarian people are loyal to socialist ideas, for which the Hungarian people fought forty years ago.

Minnih pointed out that the Hungarian working class is the well-deserved heir to the century-old revolutionary and freedom struggles of the Hungarian people. He also pointed out that only the revolutionary vanguard of the Hungarian working class—the Hungarian Communist Party—could point out the correct path for the Hungarian working class and the entire Hungarian nation. Our working class, working people, and our nation are proud that, following the great Russian socialist revolution, they made the first attempt to transform socialism into a state and social system, establishing a system that could eliminate capitalist exploitation and usher in a new era of freedom for the working people. Although the armed forces of international reactionaries and foreign interventionists, as well as the anti-people and traitorous ruling class, temporarily succeeded, it is forever impossible to eliminate from the minds of the Hungarian working class the memory of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the desire to realize the second victorious proletarian dictatorship.

Minnih emphasized that the Hungarian Soviet Republic not only inherited and carried forward the finest historical traditions of our people, but was also part of the worldwide revolutionary upsurge that began with the success of the great October Socialist Revolution.

In discussing the role of international working-class solidarity, Minnih said that conscious workers and laborers all over the world welcomed the birth of the Hungarian Soviet Republic with confidence and joy. Lenin wrote in "Greetings to the Hungarian Workers": "All loyal people in the working class around the world are on your side." Minnih said that the 1919 revolution—although strangled by external forces—brought about a historical turning point. The working class realized through its own experience that it had the determination and strength to overthrow capitalism and lead the country itself. After March 1919, the Hungarian bourgeoisie never had a peaceful day. It always felt the "threat" of the old and new 1919s around it.

Minnih pointed out that the international road of proletarian revolution is the road to victory. But on this road, there may sometimes be short-term failures and retreats. We learn from the history of the Soviet Republic that the strength of the working class lies first and foremost in the solidarity of proletarian internationalism. The failure of the Soviet Republic also made us understand its international significance. The proletarian dictatorship of 1919 failed because of the intervention and superior strength of international imperialism. We have also learned from the history of the Soviet Republic that the key to the emancipation of the working class lies in the leadership of the Communist Party and in the unity of the party with the people. In November 1918, the Communist Party of Hungary was established. On March 21, 1919, the proletarian dictatorship was established. Within four months, the Communist Party united most of the working class and a considerable part of the petty bourgeoisie around it, because the party correctly expressed the people's wishes and answered the urgent questions of the working class and peasants. The mistake during the Soviet Republic period was that the leading role of the party and the nature of the party as an organized vanguard were undermined. Lenin once said: No Communist can forget the lessons of the Hungarian Soviet Republic; the Hungarian proletariat paid a heavy price for the cooperation of Hungarian Communists with the reformists. We also know that it was a mistake for the leaders of the Soviet Republic to think that they could skip the task of implementing the revolutionary democratic land reform.

We have learned from 1919 that we must adhere to the leading role of the party and unity, and establish the proletarian dictatorship on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance. We have learned from the experience of the Soviet Republic that we must resolutely and forcefully strike at the counter-revolutionary forces. The Soviet Republic only responded to counter-revolutionary terrorist methods, and this response was relatively polite. If mistakes were made, then the mistake was not that the means were too harsh, but that they were too polite to the enemy. However, the counter-revolution took bloody, cruel, and inhumane terrorist measures, bringing the Hungarian nation to the brink of death.

Minnih said that when the proletarian dictatorship in our country was suppressed in 1919, the Beyer trade union government paved the way for the rise of Horthy fascism. The despicable revisionist group headed by Nagy played a major role in the counter-revolutionary riots of 1956. Like Horthy's pioneers in 1919, the Hungarian revisionists in 1956 also used empty slogans of democracy to cover up their shameful betrayal, repeating the clichés of "democracy" and chauvinists. However, the attempt to repeat the historical events of forty years ago in 1956 was not successful. The Hungarian people cannot be dragged back to the capitalist road, because the Hungarian people have fought twice for the socialist revolution in order to realize socialism in the motherland. The decisive factor in defeating the counter-revolution in 1956 was the conscious and active socialist forces of the Hungarian people, relying on the assistance of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. The strength of the socialist camp and the help of the international workers' movement made direct war aggression by imperialism impossible.

Minnih said that after the counter-revolutionary riots of 1956 were defeated, the Hungarian working people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, strengthened the proletarian dictatorship and achieved great achievements in socialist construction. The party carried out a resolute struggle against the remnants of the counter-revolution, and at the same time as fighting against domestic and international revisionism, successfully fought against dogmatic and sectarian errors.

Minnih pointed out that the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Republic is not only our holiday, but also a holiday for the entire international working class, a holiday for the great socialist camp, and a holiday for the millions of people who have suffered from capitalist exploitation and colonial oppression.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 20th. At the meeting of the Hungarian National Assembly on the afternoon of the 20th to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the heads of the party and government delegations of various socialist countries delivered congratulatory messages. Their congratulatory messages were warmly welcomed by the participants. The meeting place was filled with the spirit of internationalist unity and the atmosphere of brotherly friendship.

After Minnih, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, delivered his report, Aristov, head of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, member and Secretary of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a congratulatory message and read out the congratulatory message from Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to the Hungarian party and state leaders Kadar, Dobi, and Minnih, congratulating them on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

The following also delivered congratulatory messages: Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation; Koleka, head of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Ivan Mikhailov, head the Bulgarian Party and Government delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, and Minister of National Defense; Kopetsky, head of the Czechoslovakian Party and Government Delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party, and Deputy Prime Minister; Park Kim-chol, head of the Korean Party and Government Delegation, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party; Idzioldorczyk, member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; Molomjamts, head of the Mongolian Party and Government Delegation, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party, and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Heinrich Rau, head of the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, and Deputy Prime Minister; Bodnaras, head of the Romanian Party and Government Delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party Central Committee, and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Vo Nguyen Giap, head of the Party and Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense.

The heads of the party and government delegations of various fraternal countries praised in their congratulatory messages the history of the heroic struggle of the Hungarian working class and the broad masses of working people, and praised the achievements made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party. They also emphasized in their congratulatory messages the importance and great significance of the internationalist unity and mutual assistance of the world proletariat.

After the representatives of various countries spoke, Ronai, Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly, delivered the closing speech.

Ronai said that the decision of this meeting to incorporate the commemoration of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic on March 21, 1919 into law is not only to record it in words, but also to make it forever remain in the hearts of the Hungarian people.

He emphasized that the foreign guests came to attend this meeting, which fully embodies fraternal unity and support. This unity and support gave strength to the Hungarian people in the past, and it is still a reliable guarantee for our victorious progress in the future. (Attached picture)

    明尼赫报告匈牙利苏维埃共和国的历史意义
    匈人民发扬革命传统建设社会主义
    各兄弟国家代表盛赞匈人民的英勇斗争和建设成就
    据新华社布达佩斯20日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫20日在匈牙利国民议会为纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年举行的会议上作了报告。
    明尼赫说，我国人民在无产阶级国际主义团结的援助下克服了反革命造成的困难，在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下坚决地毫不动摇地建设着社会主义。我们社会主义建设工作的加速发展比任何东西都有力地证明了，匈牙利人民忠于社会主义思想，匈牙利人民在四十年前就为这个思想进行过斗争。
    明尼赫指出，匈牙利工人阶级是匈牙利人民百年来革命斗争和自由斗争传统当之无愧的继承人。他还指出，只有匈牙利工人阶级革命的先锋队——匈牙利共产党才能为匈牙利工人阶级和整个匈牙利民族指出正确的道路。我国工人阶级、劳动人民和我们民族感到自豪的是，他们继俄国伟大社会主义革命之后，首次试图把社会主义变为国家和社会的制度，建立一个能够消灭资本主义剥削、能够开辟劳动人民自由的新时期的制度。尽管国际反动派和国外干涉者的武装力量，以及反人民的卖国的统治阶级暂时得逞，但是想从匈牙利劳动阶级的心目中消除对匈牙利苏维埃共和国的忆念，消除实现第二个胜利的无产阶级专政的愿望是永远不可能的。
    明尼赫着重指出，匈牙利苏维埃共和国不仅继承和发扬了我国人民的最优秀的历史传统，而且还是全世界革命高潮的一部分，这个革命高潮是以伟大的十月社会主义革命的成功开始的。
    明尼赫在谈到国际工人阶级团结的作用时说，全世界有觉悟的工人和劳动者都满怀信心地愉快地欢迎匈牙利苏维埃共和国的诞生，列宁当时在“向匈牙利工人致敬”一文中写道：“全世界工人阶级中的一切忠实的人都是站在你们一边的。”明尼赫说，1919年的革命——尽管被外部力量所扼杀——带来了历史上的转折，工人阶级通过自己的经验认识到，它有决心和力量推翻资本主义，并且由自己来领导国家。1919年3月后，匈牙利资产阶级就再也没有安静的日子了，它总是感到在自己的周围有旧的和新的1919年的“威胁”。
    明尼赫指出，无产阶级革命的国际道路是胜利的道路。但在这条道路上有时也会有短时的失败和退却。我们从苏维埃共和国的历史中学习到，工人阶级之所以有力量，首先是由于无产阶级国际主义的团结。苏维埃共和国的失败也使我们了解到它的国际意义。1919年的无产阶级专政是因为国际帝国主义的干涉和优势力量而失败的。我们也从苏维埃共和国的历史中得到了教训，工人阶级获得解放的关键，在于共产党的领导作用，在于党同人民的团结一致。1918年11月匈牙利成立了共产党。1919年3月21日建立了无产阶级专政。共产党在四个月内，就把工人阶级的大部分和小资产阶级的相当一部分团结在自己周围，因为党正确的表达了人民的愿望，回答了工人阶级和农民的迫切问题。苏维埃共和国时期的错误是，党的领导作用和党是有组织的先锋部队的性质受到了破坏。列宁曾经说：任何一个共产党人都不能忘记匈牙利苏维埃共和国的教训，匈牙利无产阶级为匈牙利共产党人同改良派的合作付出了沉重的代价。同样我们也知道，苏维埃共和国的领导者们认为可以跳过执行革命的民主土地改革任务也是错误的。
    我们从1919年得到了教训，我们要坚持党的领导作用和团结，要在工农联盟的基础上建立无产阶级专政。我们从苏维埃共和国的经验中得到了教训，必须毫不动摇地强有力地打击反革命力量。苏维埃共和国只是对反革命恐怖手段进行了回击，这种回击是比较客气的，假使说犯了错误，那末错误不在于手段太硬，而在于对敌人过分地客气了。而反革命却采取了血腥的、残酷的和非人道的恐怖手段，把匈牙利民族带到了死亡的边缘。
    明尼赫说，1919年在我国无产阶级专政被镇压的时候，贝耶尔的工会政府为霍尔蒂法西斯的上台开辟了道路。以纳吉为首的卑鄙的修正主义集团在1956年的反革命暴乱中起了主要作用。和1919年霍尔蒂的先驱者一样，1956年匈牙利修正主义者也是用民主的空洞口号掩盖了可耻的叛变勾当，重弹“民主”和沙文主义者的滥调。但是，在1956年重演四十年前历史事件的企图没有得到成功。匈牙利人民是不能被拖回资本主义道路上去的，因为匈牙利人民为了在祖国实现社会主义，曾经两次为社会主义革命而斗争。在1956年击溃反革命的决定性的因素，是匈牙利人民的有觉悟的、积极的社会主义力量，并且依靠了社会主义阵营各国、首先是依靠了苏联的援助。社会主义阵营的力量和国际工人运动的帮助，使帝国主义直接的战争侵略成为不可能。
    明尼赫说，1956年反革命暴乱被击溃后，匈牙利劳动人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下加强了无产阶级专政，并且在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。党对反革命残余进行了坚决的斗争，在对国内和国际修正主义进行斗争的同时，成功地向教条主义和宗派主义错误进行了斗争。
    明尼赫指出，苏维埃共和国成立四十周年不仅是我们的节日，也是整个国际工人阶级的节日，是伟大社会主义阵营的节日，也是遭受资本家剥削和殖民主义压迫的千百万人民群众的节日。
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　在匈牙利国民议会20日下午举行的纪念匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年的会议上，各社会主义国家的党和政府代表团团长致了贺词。他们的贺词受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。会场上，洋溢着国际主义大团结的精神和兄弟般的友谊的气氛。

    接着致贺词的是：中国党、政代表团团长朱德副主席，阿尔巴尼亚党、政代表团团长、劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议第一副主席科列加，保加利亚党、政代表团团长、保共中央政治局委员、国防部部长伊凡·米哈伊洛夫，捷克斯洛伐克党、政代表团团长、捷共中央政治局委员、副总理柯别茨基，朝鲜党、政代表团团长、劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金哲，波兰统一工人党中央委员伊杰多尔契克，蒙古党、政代表团团长、人民革命党中央政治局候补委员、部长会议副主席莫洛姆扎木茨，德意志民主共和国党、政代表团团长、统一社会党中央政治局委员、副总理海因里希·劳，罗马尼亚党、政代表团团长、工人党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席波德纳拉希，越南民主共和国党、政代表团团长、劳动党中央政治局委员、副总理兼国防部长武元甲。
