Xinhua News Agency, Nairobi, March 15th: Kenya African People's Congress Chairman Mboya said at the party's annual meeting on the 14th that Africans are ready to take over the ruling power in Kenya.

He said, "Africans are able to send their representatives to any place -- even the United Nations. We are tired of the totalitarian government ruling us in Kenya. Let us plan to fight for freedom!" These words of his were cheered by more than a thousand representatives attending the annual meeting.

He also condemned the British colonial authorities' recent actions of arresting the leaders of the People's Congress, saying, "Dictatorship is practiced in Kenya, and the Governor is a dictator."

Mboya was re-elected as the chairman of this party at the meeting on the 14th. When he was re-elected as chairman, the representatives shouted "Uhuru" (meaning "freedom"). Mboya is also the chairman of the All-African People's Conference held in Accra last December and the chairman of the General Affairs Committee, one of its standing bodies.

The conference prayed for the members of the Nyasaland African National Congress who recently sacrificed themselves in the struggle against colonial rule.

The People's Congress is one of the nationalist parties in Kenya. Recently, the British colonial authorities arrested many leaders of this party, including the party's secretary and the person in charge of women's work, in an attempt to undermine the convening of the party's congress.

    怯尼亚人民大会党主席姆博亚宣布
    非洲人准备接管怯尼亚统治权
    新华社15日讯　内罗华消息：怯尼亚人民大会党主席姆博亚14日在这个党的年会上说，非洲人已经准备好接管怯尼亚的统治权。
    他说，“非洲人能够派遣自己的代表到任何地方去——甚至联合国。我们对于怯尼亚的统治我们的极权政府感到厌倦。让我们计划争取自由吧！”他的这些话受到参加年会的一千多名代表的欢呼。
    他还谴责英国殖民当局最近逮捕人民大会党领袖的行动说，“在怯尼亚实行着独裁，总督是一个独裁者”。
    姆博亚14日在会上被连选为这个政党的主席。当他再次当选为主席的时候，代表们高呼“乌胡鲁”
  （意为“自由”）。姆博亚也是去年12月在阿克拉召开的全非人民大会及其常设机构之一总务委员会的主席。
    大会曾为那些最近在反对殖民主义统治斗争中牺牲的尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的成员祈祷。
    人民大会党是怯尼亚的民族主义政党之一。最近，英国殖民当局曾逮捕了这个党的许多领袖，其中包括这个党的书记和妇女工作负责人，企图借此破坏这个党代表大会的召开。
