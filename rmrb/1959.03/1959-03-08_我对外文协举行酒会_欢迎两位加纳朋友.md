Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a reception this afternoon at the International club to welcome Mr. Amegbe, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the All-African People's Conference and editorial consultant of the Ghanaian magazine "Pan-African Century," and Mr. Gogoho, publisher of the Ghanaian magazine "Pan-African Century."

    Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech at the reception, warmly welcoming the Ghanaian friends. He said, "The Chinese people are very concerned about the achievements made by the Ghanaian people in safeguarding national independence, national sovereignty, developing national culture, building their own motherland, and promoting the friendly unity of the people of Asian and African countries. The Chinese people are proud of every victory of the Ghanaian people." "The Chinese people will always give great sympathy and support to the Ghanaian and African people's movements to safeguard and strive for national independence and their just struggle against imperialism and colonialism."

    Chu Tunan said, "The Chinese people are very willing to strengthen friendly ties and cultural exchanges with the Ghanaian people to continuously consolidate and develop the friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples. Mr. Amegbe and Mr. Gogoho are prestigious social activists in Ghana. This visit to China will surely make beneficial contributions to deepening the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Ghanaian people and promoting the friendly relations and cultural contact between the two peoples."

    Mr. Amegbe said in his speech at the reception that the warm reception of their Chinese hosts made them feel "as intimate in China as if they were at home." He said, "Although Ghana and China are geographically far apart, the hearts of the people of the two countries are linked together." He expressed that he would take the good impression of his visit to China back to Ghana. Amegbe told his Chinese friends from all walks of life that Ghana believes that China should restore its rightful seat in the United Nations.

    Amegbe believes that the vigorous development of the African people's anti-colonial struggle shows that "the day is not far off when colonialism and imperialists will be thrown into the sea," and that "Africa has stood up, and imperialist rule is crumbling."

    Amegbe said, "As long as the people of Asia and Africa unite and fight together, imperialism will have nowhere to stand."

    More than 200 people from all walks of life attended the reception, including Liao Chengzhi, Ding Xilin, Shao Lizi, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Hu Yuzhi, Da Punsheng, Wu Han, Ji Chao Ding, Xia Yan, and Mei Gongbin.

    我对外文协举行酒会
    欢迎两位加纳朋友
    新华社7日讯　中国人民对外文化协会今天下午在国际俱乐部举行酒会，欢迎全非人民大会筹备委员会秘书长、加纳“泛非世纪”杂志编辑顾问阿麦格倍和加纳“泛非世纪”杂志发行人哥霍霍。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南在酒会上致词，热烈欢迎加纳朋友。他说：“中国人民十分关心加纳人民在维护民族独立、国家主权、发展民族文化、建设自己的祖国和促进亚非各国人民友好团结的事业所取得的成就。中国人民为加纳人民的每一个胜利而骄傲。”“中国人民对于加纳人民和非洲人民，维护和争取民族独立的运动和反帝反殖民主义的正义斗争，将永远给予极大的同情和支持。”
    楚图南说：“中国人民很愿意同加纳人民加强友好联系和文化交流，来不断的巩固和发展两国人民的友谊和相互了解。阿麦格倍先生和哥霍霍先生是加纳负有声望的社会活动家，这次来到中国，必将为加深中加两国人民之间的相互了解，促进两国人民的友好关系和文化接触，作出有益的贡献。”
    阿麦格倍先生在酒会上讲话指出，中国主人对他们的盛情接待，使他们感到“在中国就好像在自己家里一样亲切”。他说：“加纳和中国虽然在地理上相距遥远，但是两国人民的心是连在一起的。”他表示要把访问中国的良好印象带回加纳去。阿麦格倍对他的中国各界朋友说，加纳认为中国应该恢复它在联合国的应有席位。
    阿麦格倍认为目前非洲人民反殖民主义斗争的蓬勃发展，说明“殖民主义和帝国主义者被丢到大海里的日子不远了”，“非洲站起来了，帝国主义统治摇摇欲坠”。
    阿麦格倍说：“只要亚非人民团结一致进行斗争，帝国主义就将没有落身的地方”。
    出席这个酒会的，有廖承志、丁西林、邵力子、李德全、许广平、胡愈之、达浦生、吴晗、冀朝鼎、夏衍、梅龚彬等各界人士二百多人。
