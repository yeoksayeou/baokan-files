Xinhua News Agency, March 11th, Blantyre dispatch: Just as the British colonial authorities were proclaiming that the situation in Blantyre, the capital of Nyasaland, and other major cities had become "calm," a group of brave Africans broke through the security line at Chileka Airport on the outskirts of Blantyre on the 10th and cut a section of the airport's wiring.

Chileka Airport is only eleven miles from Blantyre and has been under the strictest guard. The secret meeting of the heads of the Central African Federation colonial authorities on the 8th was held here.

The news said that Nyasaland colonial officials "were unwilling to talk about the sabotage." This incident is considered "the most amazing example of the resourcefulness" of the Nyasaland people's struggle.

In the tea-producing area of ​​Mlanje in the Southern Province, the African people's struggle against the colonial authorities is still very active. According to official sources on the 10th, despite the authorities sending large numbers of police forces to suppress them in recent days, even using armored vehicles and jet aircraft, throwing tear gas, and issuing threatening leaflets, people are still setting up roadblocks in the area. Several villages in the area are still actively resisting the colonial authorities, and telephone and transportation lines have been cut in many places and are unusable.

On the night of the 9th, more than two hundred people held a gathering on the Linsipu railway bridge near Aslima in the Central Province.

In the Hillsburg and Karonga mountain areas of the Northern Province, the struggle has been the most intense. The colonial authorities began airdropping military supplies to the colonial troops there on the 10th. This military operation means that the Hillsburg airport is not yet available to the colonial troops, and the struggle in that area cannot be ended in the short term. The Hillsburg airport was seized by Africans after the anti-colonial rule struggle in Nyasaland flourished at the end of January. The colonial authorities specially transferred troops from Tanganyika, East Africa, on March 1 to suppress it.

### 尼亚萨兰人民斗争十分活跃  英国殖民当局处境狼狈慌忙调兵遣将

    尼亚萨兰人民斗争十分活跃
    英国殖民当局处境狼狈慌忙调兵遣将
    新华社11日讯　布兰太尔消息：就在英国殖民当局宣传尼亚萨兰首府布兰太尔等主要城市的局势已趋“平静”的时候，一批勇敢的非洲人在10日突破了布兰太尔郊区契利卡机场的警卫线，并切断了这个机场上的一段电线。
    契利卡机场距布兰太尔仅仅十一英里，一直处于最严密的戒备状态。中非联邦殖民当局首脑人物8日召开的秘密会议就是在这里举行的。
    消息说，尼亚萨兰殖民官员“不愿谈论这次破坏事件”。这一事件被认为尼亚萨兰人民斗争“机敏性的最惊人的例证”。
    在南方省姆兰杰产茶地区，非洲人反抗殖民当局的斗争，仍然十分活跃。据官方10日透露，尽管当局连日派了大批警察部队前往镇压，甚至出动了装甲车、喷气式飞机，扔了催泪弹，发了威胁性的传单，目前仍旧有人在这一带安设路障。这一地区的若干村庄仍在积极反对殖民当局，电话线和交通线也有多处被切断，不能使用。
    9日夜间，在中央省阿斯利马附近的林西普铁路桥梁上，曾有二百多个群众举行集会。
    在北方省的希尔堡和卡龙加山区，斗争一直最为剧烈。殖民当局在10日开始向那里的殖民部队空投军需用品。这一军事行动意味着希尔堡的机场目前还不能为殖民部队使用，而那一带的斗争也非短期所能结束。希尔堡机场自尼亚萨兰反殖民统治的斗争在1月底蓬勃展开后，就曾为非洲人所掌握。殖民当局在3月1日曾特地从东非坦噶尼喀调部队去镇压。
