    Premier Castro Advocates for Cuba to Trade with Socialist Countries

    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th - According to TASS, Premier Castro of Cuba said in an interview with a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report" that he advocates for Cuba to trade with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    When the reporter asked the Premier whether his government intended to nationalize American enterprises in Cuba, Castro said, "We may re-examine certain concessions granted by the Batista dictatorship, as they are too burdensome for us and violate our economic interests. However, we are not talking about nationalization."

    Speaking about Cuba's domestic reforms, Castro said that the basic issues he was concerned with were reducing unemployment, implementing land reform, implementing industrialization plans, and building public works.

    Regarding the land reform plan, Castro pointed out that Cuba had two to three hundred thousand landless peasants who only had two or three months of work each year during the sugarcane harvest season. Many of them flowed into the cities, adding to the urban unemployed population. Castro said that distributing land "will greatly increase the purchasing power of the peasants, which will create conditions for the industrial development of Cuba."

    Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Santiago News: A delegation of private representatives of Cuban Premier Castro, headed by Captain Mendoza, held a press conference in Santiago on the 9th to clarify the policies of the Cuban government. Captain Mendoza said that the Cuban government would nationalize some important public utilities, complete land reform, and defend the wealth of the nation.

    卡斯特罗总理主张
    古巴同社会主义国家贸易
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：古巴总理卡斯特罗在答“美国新闻与世界报道”记者问的谈话中说，他主张古巴同苏联和其他社会主义国家进行贸易。
    记者问总理，他的政府是否打算把美国在古巴的企业收归国有。卡斯特罗说：“我们可能重新审查巴蒂斯塔独裁者所赋予的某些租让权，因为它们对我们来讲是过重的负担，并且违反我国经济利益，但是，我们不谈国有化”。
    在谈到古巴的国内改革时，卡斯特罗说，他所关心的基本问题是减少失业，实行土改，实行工业化计划和兴建公共工程。
    在谈到土改计划时，卡斯特罗指出古巴有二、三十万无地的农民，他们每年只有在收割甘蔗的季节有两三个月的工作，他们之中许多人流入城市，补充了城市的失业大军。卡斯特罗说，分配土地“将大大提高农民购买力，这将会给古巴的工业发展创造条件。”
    新华社11日讯　圣地亚哥消息：以门多萨上尉为首的古巴总理卡斯特罗的私人代表团9日在圣地亚哥举行了记者招待会，阐明古巴政府的政策。门多萨上尉说，古巴政府将把一些重要的公用事业收归国有，完成土地改革和保卫国家的财富。
