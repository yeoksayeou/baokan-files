    Using Advanced Cooperative Management Experience to Implement the Principle of More Work, More Pay
    Hubei Universally Promotes “Fixed Grade, Flexible Wage”
    (Our newspaper Wuhan, 8th dispatch) After implementing a distribution system combining wages and supply in the People's Communes of Hubei Province, in order to better utilize the initiative of each production team and commune members, and to better encourage the broad masses of commune members to serve the socialist construction cause, the practices of "Four Guarantees," "One Determination," and "Fixed Grade, Flexible Wage" have been universally implemented, achieving good results.
    The broad masses of commune members greatly welcome "eating without money, receiving monthly wages." They reflect that: this is considered to have received an "iron rice bowl," no longer needing to constantly worry about eating, and can concentrate wholeheartedly on production. The commune members' production enthusiasm has greatly increased. However, some commune members in some People's Communes have even said after implementing the distribution system combining wages and supply: "Whether you work or not, it's still three meals a day; whether you do anything or not, the monthly wage won't be less." Why does this situation occur? Of course, this is related to the not entirely reasonable wage grading and insufficient publicity of the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work;" but more importantly, it is because these communes, after their establishment, did not inherit the originally effective management methods of the agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time, new management systems were not established. Therefore, a situation of "no rules" or unclear rules, as the masses said, formed within the People's Communes.
    How to change this situation? Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xu Daoqi, Secretary of the Secretariat, first assisted the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee in Xiangyang Prefecture in summarizing the original agricultural cooperative's management and operation experience, and the new experiences accumulated after the establishment of People's Communes in various places. Based on this, and adapting to the nature and characteristics of the People's Communes, they formulated a set of management methods related to the People's Communes' management and operation. These methods mainly are: The People's Commune implements "Four Guarantees" and "One Determination" for the production teams; the production team implements "Fixed Grade, Flexible Wage" for the commune members; at the same time, the originally effective field management responsibility system of the agricultural cooperatives is restored and developed. These practices have had good results after being implemented in Xiangyang Prefecture. Therefore, they are being promoted throughout the province.
    In Guanghua County, Xiangyang Prefecture, due to the implementation of the above practices, a new production upsurge appeared quickly and violently, and the masses' production enthusiasm was particularly high. In each production team of Huangzhou People's Commune, Huanggang County, since the implementation of "Fixed Grade, Flexible Wage," the attendance rate has generally increased by about 30%. Many people who have not been graded have also automatically and actively participated in production. After the Sanjiang Commune in Qianjiang County implemented "Four Guarantees" and "One Determination," the management enthusiasm of each production team was greatly improved, and labor efficiency generally increased by one to two times.
    The "Four Guarantees" implemented by the People's Communes in Hubei Province for the production teams are: Guaranteeing cultivated area, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing output value; Guaranteeing investment (i.e., financial contract); Guaranteeing wages, guaranteeing supply; Guaranteeing increased production measures (calculating the amount of labor required). "One Determination" is determining rewards and punishments - rewarding overproduction and allowing the team to use any surplus; The characteristics of "Four Guarantees" and "One Determination" are: It combines the responsibility system and the reward and punishment system, which can give play to the production team's management enthusiasm, and at the same time, facilitate the People's Commune's leadership over the production team. The specific practice of the production team implementing "Fixed Grade, Flexible Wage" for the commune members is that the People's Commune distributes wages to each production team according to the originally graded wage levels, the production team implements work evaluation and score recording for the commune members' labor, and distributes wages to each commune member (including those who have not been graded) monthly according to the amount of work points actually earned. For some people who are not easy to evaluate work and record points (such as feeders, cooks, childcare workers, and workers, etc.), the method of basic wages plus bonus wages is adopted. The benefit of this approach is that whoever labors more gets more wages; people without grades get wages the same way when they participate in labor, so they can better utilize the commune members' labor enthusiasm. At the same time, because the practice of work evaluation and score recording has been implemented in the past agricultural cooperatives for many years and is familiar to the masses, it is relatively easy to implement, so it is deeply welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.
    These practices are formulated based on the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more pay." Judging from the results of the implementation in various places in Hubei Province, they do have a great effect on promoting the development of production. However, Hubei Province's experience proves that while implementing these practices, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen political and ideological work and improve the socialist and communist consciousness of commune members and cadres. Neglecting this point and unilaterally emphasizing material incentives will not be conducive to improving the awareness of commune members and cadres, and thus will not be able to achieve the goal of better encouraging people to serve socialist construction.

### 运用高级社管理经验执行多劳多得原则  湖北普遍推行“死级别、活工资”

    运用高级社管理经验执行多劳多得原则
    湖北普遍推行“死级别、活工资”
    本报武汉8日电　湖北省各地人民公社在实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度以后，为了更好地发挥各生产队和社员群众的积极性，更好地鼓励广大社员群众为社会主义建设事业服务，普遍地实现了“四包”、“一定”和“死级别、活工资”作法，收到了良好的效果。
    广大社员对“吃饭不要钱、按月发工资”是非常欢迎的。他们反映说：这算是拿到了“铁饭碗”，再不用经常为吃饭担心，可以专心一意搞生产了。社员们的生产积极性大大提高。但是，也有一些人民公社在实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度以后，有些社员甚至说：“干不干每天还是三顿饭，搞不搞一月工资少不了。”为什么会出现这种情况？当然，这和工资评级不尽合理和对“各尽所能，按劳分配”这一原则宣传得不够是有关系的；但更重要的是因为这些公社建立后，没有把原来农业社行之有效的管理方法继承下来，同时新的管理制度又没有建立起来。因此在人民公社内部形成了如群众所说的“没有规矩”或规矩不明。
    如何改变这种情况？中共湖北省委第一书记王任重和书记处书记许道琦，首先在襄阳专区帮助襄阳地委总结了原来农业社的经营管理经验，和各地建立人民公社后积累的新经验并在此基础上适应人民公社的性质和特点，制定了一套有关人民公社经营管理的办法。这些办法主要是：人民公社对生产队实行“四包”、“一定”，生产队对社员实行
  “死级别、活工资”，同时还恢复和发展了原来农业社行之有效的田间管理责任制度。这些作法在襄阳专区实行后，收到了好的效果。于是，在全省推行。
    襄阳专区的光化县，由于实行上述作法，生产新高潮出现得既快又猛，群众生产积极性特别高涨。黄冈县黄州人民公社各生产队，自从实行了
  “死级别、活工资”后，出勤率普遍提高30％左右，许多没评上级的人也自动地、积极地参加了生产。潜江县三江公社实行“四包”、“一定”后，各生产队的经营积极性大大提高，劳动效率普遍提高一倍到二倍。
    湖北省各地人民公社对生产队实行的“四包”是：包耕作面积、包产量、包产值；包投资（即财务包干）；包工资、包供给；包增产措施（计算出用工数量）。“一定”是定奖惩——超产奖励，节余自用；“四包”、“一定”的特点是：它把责任制和奖惩制度结合起来，可以发挥生产队的经营积极性，同时，便于人民公社对生产队进行领导。生产队对社员实行“死级别、活工资”的具体作法是，人民公社按原来评的工资级别把工资发给各生产队，生产队对社员的劳动实行评工记分，根据每个社员（包括未评级的）实作工分多少按月发给工资。对一些不便于评工记分的人（如饲养员、炊事员、保育员和工人等），则采取基本工资加奖励工资的办法。这种作法的好处是，谁劳动多，得的工资也多；没级别的人参加劳动也一样得工资，因而能更好地发挥社员的劳动积极性。同时，由于评工记分的作法是过去农业社实行了多年的，已为群众所熟悉，执行起来也较容易，因此深受广大社员的欢迎。
    这些作法是根据“按劳分配，多劳多得”的原则制订的，从湖北省各地实行的结果来看，对推动生产的发展确有很大的作用。但是，湖北省经验证明，在实行这些作法的同时，还必须不断地加强政治思想工作，提高社员和干部的社会主义和共产主义觉悟。忽视了这一点，片面地强调物质鼓励，将不利于社员和干部觉悟提高，从而也就不可能达到更好地鼓励人们为社会主义建设服务的目的。（方）
