Chengdu Dispatch: Leap forward again, higher yields again—the counties of Wenjiang Special District on the Western Sichuan Plain are launching a vigorous campaign to achieve 10,000 jin per mu on large areas. The goal of this competition is to select approximately three million mu of relatively good land from the 8.6 million mu of cultivated land in the entire special district and strive to achieve an annual grain yield of 10,000 jin per mu within one or two years.

This competition was initiated by Pixian County, a well-known high-yield grain county in Sichuan. Last year, the county's grain yield reached 3,160 jin per mu. This year, they boldly put forward the slogan "Reach a new level and break through the 10,000 jin barrier," planning to achieve a total yield of 10,000 jin per mu for both seasons on 300,000 mu of grain cultivation land. With this goal, they challenged the neighboring Xinfan County. Xinfan County also proposed the same target of 10,000 jin per mu for grain yield, along with a parallel emphasis on industry and agriculture, a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and an average income of 1,000 yuan per member (total income, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries), challenging Pixian County and all counties in the district. Subsequently, Pengxian, Wenjiang, Guanghan, Xindu, and other counties responded to the challenge and issued challenges of their own. The upsurge of competition quickly swept across the entire district. Not only between counties, but also between communes and production teams within each county, challenge letters flew everywhere, forming a vibrant and diverse scene of nationwide socialist competition. These competitions are all centered on the goal of 10,000 jin per mu for grain yield. Some aim to achieve 10,000 jin on all grain cultivation land, while others target a portion, comparing yields, measures, and enthusiasm based on their own conditions. The general targets are: 3,000 jin or 4,000 jin per mu for wheat, and 6,000 jin or 7,000 jin per mu for rice.

Can a yield of 10,000 jin per mu be achieved on large areas of cultivated land this year? Since January, this question has been hotly debated by cadres and the masses at the four-level cadre meetings in each county and at the expanded cadre meetings and mass meetings in each commune. By summarizing the experience of high yields last year and analyzing the current situation, the understanding of cadres and the masses has been greatly enhanced, and their confidence has been strengthened. Everyone believes that the Western Sichuan Plain has limited land and a large population, with an average of only a little over one mu of land per person. Only by greatly increasing grain production can we better develop diversified economies and build industry. Achieving 10,000 jin per mu on some of the better land is possible because the Great Leap Forward last year accumulated rich experience, the bumper harvest provided a more solid material foundation, and the people's communes provided basic favorable conditions. In addition, the Wenjiang Special District has its own favorable conditions. This is because the district started early and did well in managing the spring crops, making high yields highly promising. Secondly, the district has a mild climate, fertile soil, and superior water conservancy conditions, which are very conducive to high crop yields. The three million mu of paddy fields participating in the 10,000 jin competition in the district are all selected from the best land on the Western Sichuan Plain. These lands have ample water supply, can drain and irrigate, ensuring harvests regardless of floods or droughts, and the soil is very fertile, making it a region in the "Land of Abundance" where "people are free from drought and flood and never know hunger." In summarizing last year's experience, various localities found that many communes achieved high rice yields of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, some even reaching 6,000 to 7,000 jin, and a few exceeding 10,000 jin. These high yields were not achieved with very perfect measures, and there were still many loopholes. Therefore, this year, as long as we exert ourselves, cultivate carefully, and achieve large-scale yields of 10,000 jin per mu, it is possible.

In order to achieve this goal, various localities have widely mobilized the masses and formulated a series of practical and feasible measures. Localities generally start from the following aspects: (1) Strengthening field management, completely eliminating the third-class wheat seedlings that may not reach 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, while preventing first-class seedlings from lodging, improving fertilization methods, and applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers or nitrogenous fertilizers according to the needs of the seedlings. (2) Further carrying out a crash program of accumulating and creating fertilizer, requiring that before spring plowing, in addition to preparing enough topdressing fertilizer for wheat, each mu of spring耕land for crops such as rice should be prepared with 200,000 jin of fertilizer (compost and smoked soil fertilizer), 2,000 jin of soil fertilizer, and 200 jin of high-quality soil fertilizer; running soil fertilizer factories on a large scale; in addition, managing the district's more than 2 million mu of green manure well, and increasing the output by about twice as much as last year through fertilization and irrigation. (3) Preparing for the sowing of spring crops in advance, comprehensively and meticulously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," requiring all spring-sown cultivated land to be deeply plowed one and a half to two feet deep, and combining deep plowing with large-scale smoked soil to improve the soil and increase fertility; applying heavy base fertilizer, applying fertilizer in layers; fully implementing close planting, generally using more than 40 jin of seeds per mu to ensure more than 800,000 ears per mu, and fully adopting high-yield fine varieties; in addition, strengthening drainage facilities in terms of water conservancy, striving to ensure that there is not only water when needed, but also drainage when not needed; vigorously developing soil pesticide production, etc. (4) Concentrating efforts on cultivating "10,000-jin mu," appropriately reducing some barren mountainous land for the development of forestry and animal husbandry. Through intensive cultivation, high-yield fields will all be brought up to the level of garden plots. (5) In order to implement the above measures, various localities have proposed vigorously improving labor organization, rationally arranging labor, and investing about 70% of the labor force in agricultural production. (6) According to the large-scale increase in high yields and labor, various localities are vigorously carrying out tool reform. Many places require that human sowing, threshing, and transplanting be basically eliminated this year, and that transportation be mechanized with vehicles and processing be mechanized. (7) Strengthening the leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of politics in command, doing a good job in political and ideological work, constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas, and at the same time improving leadership methods, making full use of visits, evaluations, competitions and other methods to carry out mass movements on a large scale.

Currently, the wheat growth in various parts of Wenjiang Special District is very good, with generally more than 800,000 ears per mu, and there is great hope of reaching 1 million ears. In order to fire the first shot and further strengthen field management, various localities are checking loopholes, adding measures, and striving for wheat to reach the target yield. According to the current fertilizer needs of wheat seedlings and in preparation for spring crops, various localities have successively launched a vigorous campaign to accumulate and create fertilizer. Pixian County, after initiating the competition, has continuously launched the "Wheat Seedling Upgrade" and "Crash Fertilizer Accumulation" campaigns, taking measures such as suppression, irrigation, fertilization, and soil loosening according to the condition of the wheat seedlings, so that wheat can achieve "three increases" - increasing the number of ears, increasing the number of grains, and increasing the weight of grains. After Guanghan County responded to the challenge, it immediately launched a mass evaluation and inspection campaign throughout the county, implementing a "three visits to the field a day" management method for 10% of the county's third-class seedlings, and quickly topdressing a large amount of water manure and dry manure.

    川西平原力争更高产
    温江专区各县精心培植大面积高额丰产田
    发动群众，增添措施，竞赛运动有声有色
    本报成都讯　跃进再跃进，高产更高产——川西平原上的温江专区各县掀起了热火朝天的大面积亩产万斤粮的竞赛。这一竞赛的目标是要在全专区八百六十万亩的耕地中，选出大约三百万亩条件较好的土地，力争在一两年内全年粮食亩产达到一万斤。
    这场竞赛首先是由四川著名的粮食高产县郫县发起的。这个县去年粮食亩产达到三千一百六十斤。今年，他们豪迈地提出“更上一层楼，闯过万斤关”的口号，计划三十万亩粮食耕作地两季收成合计全部达到亩产一万斤，并以此向相邻的新繁县提出挑战。新繁也同时以粮食亩产万斤的同样指标，和工农业并举，农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进，使社员平均收入达到一千元
  （总收入，包括农林牧副渔）为条件，向郫县并全区各县提出挑战。这样，彭县、温江、广汉、新都等县相继应战并挑战，竞赛热潮随即席卷全区。不仅在各县之间，而且在一县内的各公社之间、生产队之间也都战表纷飞，形成了一幅热情交织、形式多样的全民社会主义大竞赛。这些竞赛都是以粮食亩产万斤为中心，有的拿出全部粮食耕地搞万斤，有的拿出一部分，根据本身条件比产量、比措施、比干劲，而指标一般是：小麦亩产三千斤或四千斤，水稻亩产六千斤或七千斤。
    今年在大面积耕地上能不能达到亩产万斤？从1月份以来，在各县的四级干部会议上，在各公社的扩干会、群众会上，广大干部群众对这个问题展开了热烈的讨论。通过总结去年高产经验和分析当前形势，大大提高了干部和群众的认识，坚定了信心。大家认为：川西平原地少人多，平均每人只有一亩多地，只有粮食产量大大提高，才能更好地发展多种经济，建设工业。而在一部分较好的土地上实现亩产万斤，除了去年大跃进积累了丰富的经验，大丰收提供了更雄厚的物质基础，以及人民公社化这些基本有利条件外，温江专区各地还有其本身有利条件。这就是全区小春作物抓得早，抓得好，高产十分有望；其次，全区气候温和，土地肥沃，水利条件优越，作物高产条件很好。这次全区参加万斤竞赛的三百万亩水田都是挑选川西平原上最好的土地。这些土地有充分的水利保证，能排能灌，涝旱都能保收，土质又十分肥沃，是“天府之国”中的“水旱从人，不知饥馑”的地区。在总结去年经验中，各地发现去年许多公社都有水稻亩产三、四千斤的高产，有些还达六、七千斤，个别达一万斤以上。这些高产在措施上也并不是很完善的，还有很多漏洞，因此今年只要鼓足干劲，精心培植，大面积亩产万斤是可能的。
    为了实现这一指标，各地广泛发动群众，订出了一系列切实可行的措施。各地一般都从下列几个方面着手：（1）加强田间管理，把可能达不到亩产三四千斤的三类麦苗彻底消灭掉，同时防止一类苗倒伏，改进施肥方法，根据苗稻施磷钾肥或氮素肥。（2）进一步开展突击积肥造肥运动，要求在春耕前除准备足小麦所需追肥外，还要为水稻等大春耕地每亩准备好二十万斤肥料（堆肥和熏土肥），两千斤土化肥和二百斤优质土化肥；大办土化肥工厂；此外还要把全区二百多万亩绿肥管好，通过施肥灌水，使产量比去年翻一番左右。（3）提前做好大春作物播种准备，全面细致地贯彻“八字宪法”，要求全部春播耕地深耕一尺五到两尺，并结合深耕大搞熏土，以改良土壤增加肥力；重施底肥，分层施肥；全部实行密植，一般每亩用种量要在四十斤以上，保证每亩八十万穗以上，全部采用高产良种；此外，在水利方面加强排水设施，力求做到不仅用水有水，而且做到不用可排；大力发展土农药生产等。（4）集中力量种好“万斤亩”，适当减少一些土地贫瘠的山地，用以发展林、牧业。通过精耕细作使高产田都达到园田化。（5）为贯彻上述措施，各地提出大力改善劳动组织，合理安排劳力，把70％左右的劳力投入农业生产。（6）根据大面积高产和劳动量增加几倍的情况，各地大搞工具改革，许多地方要求今年基本上消灭人力播种、脱粒和栽插，和实现运输车子化，加工机械化。
  （7）加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，做好政治思想工作，不断克服右倾保守思想，同时改进领导方法，充分运用参观、评比、竞赛等方法大搞群众运动。
    现在，温江专区各地小麦生长十分良好，一般每亩都在八十万穗以上，达到一百万穗大有希望。为了打响第一炮，进一步加强田间管理，各地查漏洞，添措施，力争小麦达到指标产量。根据当前麦苗需肥情况和为大春作物做好准备，各地都先后掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥运动。郫县在发起竞赛后就连续开展了“麦苗升级”和“突击积肥”运动，根据麦苗情况分别采取镇压、灌水、施肥和松土等措施，使小麦达到“三增”——增加穗数、增加粒数、增加粒重。广汉县应战后立即在全县开展了群众性的评比检查运动，对全县10％的三类苗实行“一日三到田”的管理办法，并迅速追施了大量的水粪和干粪。（附图片）
