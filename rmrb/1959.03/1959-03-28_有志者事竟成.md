Behind the Scenes

    Where There's a Will, There's a Way
      "Where there's a will, there's a way" is the main experience of the workers in the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 in winning the national open hearth furnace high-yield red flag. Last year, their utilization coefficient lagged behind the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, but starting in October last year, this workshop began to work hard and vigorously promote mass movements. They also humbly learned from the experience of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 and other steel plants, constantly shortening smelting time, continuously improving the technology of utilizing local iron, constantly breaking down conservative thinking, and boldly expanding furnace production from the original designed volume of 15.4 tons to 30 tons, 40 tons, 50 tons, and 60 tons. As a result, in February of this year, they finally increased the open hearth furnace utilization coefficient to 12.27, ranking among the top in the country's high-yield open hearth furnaces. This shows that will is very important. Of course, the so-called will is definitely not an individualistic or departmentalist will, but a will to "strive for the upper reaches and build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way." Only such a will can be considered a great aspiration, and only then can one become a "great talent" and create great achievements.

    有志者事竟成
      “有志者事竟成”是上钢一厂平炉车间职工们所以能够获得全国平炉高产红旗的主要经验。去年他们的利用系数落在上钢三厂平炉车间后面，但从去年10月份起，这个车间开始发奋图强，大闹群众运动，又虚心地学习上钢三厂和其他钢铁厂的经验，不断缩短冶炼时间，不断提高利用土铁的技术，不断地破除保守思想，大胆扩大炉产量，将原来设计容积15.4吨的平炉扩大到三十吨、四十吨、五十吨、六十吨。这样终于在今年2月份把平炉利用系数提高到12.27，在全国高产平炉中名列前茅。由此可见，志十分重要。当然，所谓志，决非个人主义本位主义的志，而是“力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的志，只有这样的志才能算大志，才能成“大器”，创造丰功伟绩。
