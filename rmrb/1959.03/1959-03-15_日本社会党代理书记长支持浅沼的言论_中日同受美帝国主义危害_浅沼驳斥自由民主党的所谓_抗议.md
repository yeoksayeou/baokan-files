Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Acting Secretary-General Tomomi Narita stated today that the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party's "protest" against the remarks made by the head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, Inejiro Asanuma, in Beijing, is an attempt to sabotage the talks between the Socialist Party delegation and the Chinese side.

The Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, who is currently visiting Beijing, delivered a speech at a lecture meeting held in Beijing on the 12th, condemning U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and Japan's territory of Okinawa, and establishing military bases on these islands. Asanuma said: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. We are fighting against U.S. imperialism."

However, Takeo Fukuda, Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, under the instructions of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, sent a telegram to Inejiro Asanuma on the 13th, requesting him to be "more cautious" in expressing his views on international issues in the future.

In his statement today, Acting Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Tomomi Narita, expressed his firm support for Inejiro Asanuma's speech and said: "Of course, U.S. imperialism should be opposed."

Referring to Asanuma's remarks that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan," Narita said: It is a fact that Taiwan is under the control of the United States, and that the United States has military bases in Japan. He also said: It is also a fact that the United States threatens the security of the Far East by establishing military bases in Japan and placing Taiwan under its rule. Narita also said that due to the above facts, Japan and China are suffering from "common harm," which is also the actual situation.

Narita emphasized that the Socialist Party firmly trusts Asanuma's words and deeds. He also said that the Liberal Democratic Party's actions are an interference in the internal affairs of the Socialist Party.

According to a report by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Inejiro Asanuma also refuted the Liberal Democratic Party's "protest" against interference in the Socialist Party's activities in a statement to Japanese reporters in Beijing yesterday. He said: His speech was a criticism of the imperialist policies of the United States, which is only natural from the standpoint of the Socialist Party.

The Japan Peace Committee stated today that it fully supports the opinion expressed by Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, in Beijing on the 12th that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan."

A spokesman for the Japan Peace Committee said that Asanuma's opinion is the basis for maintaining friendly relations with China and shows that a step forward has been taken in the struggle for Asian peace.

The spokesman said that the Japan Peace Committee calls on other peace and friendship organizations in Japan to support Asanuma's remarks.

    日本社会党代理书记长支持浅沼的言论
    中日同受美帝国主义危害
    浅沼驳斥自由民主党的所谓“抗议”
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本社会党代理书记长成田知已今天发表谈话指出，日本自由民主党对日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎在北京发表的谈话提出的“抗议”，是企图破坏社会党代表团同中国方面的会谈。
    正在北京访问的日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎曾经于12日在北京举行的演讲会上发表演讲，谴责美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾和日本领土冲绳岛，并在这些岛屿上建立军事基地。浅沼说：“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人。我们为反对美帝国主义而斗争。”
    但是，日本执政的自由民主党干事长福田赳夫在日本首相岸信介的指示下，在13日竟然打电报给浅沼稻次郎，要求他今后在表示对于国际问题的看法时“要比较慎重一些”。
    社会党代理书记长成田知已在今天的谈话中表示坚决支持浅沼稻次郎的演讲，并且说：“当然应该反对美帝国主义”。
    成田谈到浅沼关于“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人”的谈话时说：台湾处于美国的控制之下，美国在日本设有军事基地，这是事实。他还说：由于美国在日本设有军事基地并把台湾置于它的统治之下，美国威胁着远东的安全，这也是事实。成田并且说，由于上述事实，日本和中国遭受着“共同的危害”，这也是实际情况。
    成田强调说，社会党坚决信任浅沼的言行。他并且说，自由民主党的行动是对社会党内部事务的干涉。
    据日本广播协会电台报道，浅沼稻次郎昨天向在北京的日本记者发表谈话，也驳斥了自由民主党干涉社会党活动的“抗议”。他说：他的演讲是批判美国的帝国主义政策，这从社会党的立场来说，是理所当然的。
    日本和平委员会今天表示完全支持日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎12日在北京发表的关于“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人”的意见。
    日本和平委员会的发言人说，浅沼的意见是同中国保持友好关系的基础，并且表明了在为争取亚洲和平的斗争中前进了一步。
    发言人说，日本和平委员会要求日本的其他和平和友好团体支持浅沼的谈话。
