To adapt to the greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, all parts of the country have actively arranged the preparation of seeds for spring-sown crops. According to the requirements of planting density, most regions and crops have retained enough seeds for spring sowing, and some crops even have surpluses. According to incomplete statistics, the people's communes in six provinces, including Anhui, Zhejiang, Jilin, Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan, have retained themselves and the state has purchased a total of 8.2 billion jin of early rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grain seeds. The people's communes in Anhui Province have retained 490 million jin of fine early rice seeds and the state has reserved them. The province plans to plant 15 million mu of early rice this year, which, calculated at 30 jin per mu, leaves a surplus of 40 million jin; more than 111 million jin of cotton seeds have been retained, with plans to plant 7 million mu, leaving a surplus of more than 6 million jin. The four special districts and one city in Zhejiang Province have prepared more than 1 billion jin of early rice seeds, and the amount of seed retained per mu in Jiaxing Special District has increased by more than two times compared with last year. The spring-sown miscellaneous grain crop seeds in the northern provinces have generally been fully prepared according to the requirements of dense planting. Jilin Province has stored more than 300 million jin of miscellaneous grain crop seeds; Heilongjiang Province has fully prepared the seeds for the six major crops of sorghum, corn, millet, soybeans, rice, and spring wheat, which account for 80% of the total sown area; Hebei and Shandong have prepared more sowing amounts per mu than in previous years, such as Shandong's corn seed retention of an average of more than 14 jin per mu, sorghum 7.3 jin, millet 4.3 jin, and small miscellaneous grains 7.6 jin. The seeds retained by the twelve provinces that plant spring wheat and the seeds adjusted by the state reserves can complete the spring sowing plan, and the amount of seeds retained is generally 1 to 1.5 times more than last year.

The yellow jute and hemp seeds needed this year were originally in short supply. After mutual consultation and adjustment, under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard," Shaanxi, Zhejiang and other provinces, in addition to retaining enough for their own use, supported the new hemp areas and provinces and cities with insufficient seeds, basically ensuring the realization of the national hemp planting plan.

This year, there was also a large-scale inter-provincial adjustment of fine varieties of various crops. A total of 730.56 million jin of fine seeds of early rice, spring wheat, potatoes, cotton, hemp, jute, sorghum, and corn have been adjusted, of which the larger quantities are early rice, spring wheat, and potatoes, which is more than 60% more than the amount of fine seeds adjusted for spring sowing last year. At present, most of these seeds have been transported to the provinces that need seeds, and a small number are being actively transferred. At present, many regions are also carrying out intra-provincial adjustment and balancing work. All localities are carrying out a general survey of seeds in conjunction with the preparation for cultivation, mobilizing the masses to exchange seeds, and organizing the fine selection of seeds before sowing. Generally, the purity and germination rate of seeds that have been finely selected are significantly improved. The purity of rice seeds selected by the Chengnan Commune in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, has increased from 90% to 98%. The Department of Agriculture of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region believes that fine selection of seeds is one of the important measures to achieve increased grain production, and requires to immediately launch a mass movement to finely select seeds, with the whole party and all people mobilizing to make a big seed revolution. Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces have also made arrangements for the seed selection work before sowing. A mass movement of fine selection and treatment of seeds before sowing has already begun.

    春播良种基本备足
    种子精选和处理工作已经展开
    本报讯　全国各地为了适应1959年农业生产的更大跃进，春播作物种子的准备工作，已积极作了安排。按照密植程度的要求，绝大部分地区和作物已留够了春播所需种子，有的作物还有富余。根据不完全统计：安徽、浙江、吉林、山东、河北、湖南等六省人民公社自留和国家收购的早稻、棉花、杂粮等种子共达八十二亿斤。安徽省各公社的自留种和国家储备的早稻良种共四亿九千万斤，今年全省计划种早稻一千五百万亩，以每亩三十斤计算，还富余四千万斤；棉花共留种一亿一千一百多万斤，计划种七百万亩，余六百多万斤。浙江省四个专区一个市准备的早稻种子已经在十亿斤以上，嘉兴专区每亩留种数量比去年增加二倍以上。北方各省的春播杂粮作物种子，一般也按密植要求作了充分准备。吉林省已储留的杂粮作物种子达三亿多斤；黑龙江省占总播种面积80％的高粱、玉米、谷子、大豆和水稻、春小麦六大作物种子全部备妥；河北、山东每亩准备的播种量都超过往年，如山东玉米种每亩留种量平均十四斤以上，高粱七点三斤，谷子四点三斤，小杂粮七点六斤。种植春麦的十二个省自留和国家储备调剂的种子可以完成春播计划，留种量一般比去年增加一至一点五倍以上。
    今年需要的黄洋麻，大麻种子本来比较紧张，经过互相协商调剂，在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，陕西、浙江等省除留足本省自用以外，其余均支援新麻区和种子不足的省市，基本上保证了国家种麻计划的实现。
    今年省区间还调剂了大批各种作物的良种。已调剂的早稻、春麦、马铃薯、棉花、大麻、黄麻、高粱、玉米等优良种子共七亿三千零五十六万斤，其中数量较大的是早稻、春麦、马铃薯，比去年春播良种调剂量增加60％以上。目前这批种子大部分已运往各需种省，少数正在积极调运中。目前许多地区还正在进行省内的调剂平衡工作。各地均结合备耕检查，进行种子的普查工作，发动群众串换，组织播种前的种子精选工作。一般经过精选的种子，纯度发芽率显著提高。浙江省绍兴县城南公社粒选的稻种，纯度由90％提高到98％。宁夏回族自治区农业厅认为精选种子是实现粮食增产重要措施之一，要求立即开展精选种子的群众性运动，全党动手，全民动员大闹种子革命。陕西、河南等省对播种前的选种工作也都作了布置。群众性的在播种前精选种子和种子处理工作已经展开。
