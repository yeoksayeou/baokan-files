Leap Forward Jottings

    Creative Labor
    Workers Qin Guangjin and Zeng Dezhi, Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory

    On the basis of the victory of 1958, we have started a new battle for a greater leap forward this year. In a short period of time, many heroic figures who dare to be bold in creation have emerged in our working class ranks. Their common feature is creative labor.

    Creative labor is labor that combines hard work with clever work. So-called hard work means giving full play to a high degree of enthusiasm, not fearing difficulties, and working selflessly; so-called clever work means giving full play to a high degree of intelligence, carrying out technical reforms, inventions, and creations, so that labor can achieve greater results. They have an inseparable connection. For example, if you want to improve and reform technology, you have to use your brain to think and your hands to do it. This kind of research and trial process is a process of using both hands and brains, and it is also a process of combining hard work and clever work. Without hard work, there can be no clever work; and only hard work without clever work will waste a lot of valuable effort. Our working class cannot be satisfied with such labor.

    Therefore, we must closely combine hard work and clever work, so that they can promote and affect each other. Some people regard cultural and technical level as the absolute factor of clever work, which is one-sided. Take Comrade Liao Shigang from our factory as an example. In terms of culture, he only studied for two years before entering the factory (and now he only has a primary school education); in terms of technology, he is only a fourth-grade milling worker. Why can he create miracles in production and make outstanding achievements? The most fundamental point is that he can think boldly, act boldly, combine hard work and clever work well, combine his hands and brain well, and give full play to his enthusiasm and creativity.

    Everyone has hands and brains, everyone can engage in creative labor, and everyone can create something in labor. The question is whether they are willing to do it and think hard, and whether they can combine hard work and clever work.

    Great Ambition
    Mao Zhenya

    Last spring, I saw a large slogan written on the snow-white wall of an agricultural production cooperative: "Cross the Yellow River, surpass the Yangtze River, turn barren land into Jiangnan." A cadre from the cooperative told me that the soil here is not good, but they are confident that under the leadership of the Party, they can turn their rural area into a land of fish and rice like Jiangnan. I really admired their ambition and spirit. Recently, I went there again, and the situation is very different from last year. Electric lights have been installed, loudspeakers are hanging on the trees, broadcasting beautiful music, and a muddy path leading to the bus station has now become a four-meter-wide cinder road for cars. The former cooperative cadre is now the director of the chemical fertilizer factory in the People's Commune. I looked closely at his glowing face, and then at the five large characters written on the snow-white wall, "People's Commune is Good," and felt an even greater ambition.

    Yes, great ambition originally grows in the working people. But when there is the Party, and the people are the masters of the country, creating their own paradise with their own hands, this ambition becomes even more vast, it can shake the earth and overturn the mountains and seas. Last year, the whole people engaged in steelmaking in a big way, and successfully overfulfilled the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel; the People's Commune is like the rising sun, emitting dazzling light; in the cause of socialist construction, heroes proposed to make high mountains bow their heads, and rivers give way; splitting mountains to divert water, ordering the land to hand over grain, these are all manifestations of great ambition.

    In this great era of the Great Leap Forward, great ambition can be seen everywhere, not only inspiring people to move forward forever, from victory to victory, but also, from great ambition, clearly seeing the most beautiful tomorrow of the motherland.

    跃进随笔
    创造性的劳动
    重庆建设机床厂工人　秦光金　曾德志
    在1958年胜利的基础上，我们开始了今年更大跃进的新战斗，在短短的时间内，在我们工人阶级的队伍里就涌现了不少敢于大胆创造的英雄人物。他们的共同特点是创造性的劳动。
    创造性的劳动是苦干与巧干相结合的劳动。所谓苦干，就是发挥高度的积极性，不怕困难，忘我地劳动；所谓巧干，就是发挥高度的智慧，去革新技术、发明创造，使劳动收到更大的效果。它们有着不可分割的联系，比如说，你要去改进，革新技术，就要动脑子去想，动手去作，这种钻研试作的功夫，就是手脑并用的过程，也是苦干和巧干结合的过程，没有苦干，便不可能有巧干；而只有苦干，没有巧干，便会浪费很多宝贵的力气。我们工人阶级不能满足于这样的劳动。
    因此，必须把苦干和巧干紧密结合起来，使它们互相推动互相作用。有些人把文化、技术水平看成是巧干的绝对因素，是片面的。就拿我们厂的廖世刚同志来说吧，论文化他入厂前仅仅读过两年书（现在也只有高小程度）；论技术现在也只是四级铣工。为啥他能在生产中创造奇迹，做出卓越的成绩呢？最根本的一点，就是他能大胆的想，大胆的干，苦干与巧干结合得好，手和脑结合得好，充分发挥了积极性和创造性。
    人人都有手和脑，人人都能进行创造性劳动，也都能在劳动中有所创造。问题就看肯不肯干和苦想、能不能把苦干和巧干结合起来。
    伟大的气魄
    毛震亚
    去年春天，我在一个农业生产合作社雪白的墙上，看到一行斗大的标语字：“过黄河，超长江，穷土要变江南地。”合作社一位干部告诉我，这里土质不好，但他们有信心在党的领导下把自己的农村变为江南鱼米之乡。我心里实在钦佩他们这种雄心和气魄。最近，我又去到那里，情景已和去年大不相同了。电灯安上了，扩音喇叭挂在树上，正播送着优美的音乐，一条通往汽车站的泥泞小路，现已变成四公尺宽的煤屑汽车路了。那位过去的合作社干部，现在已是人民公社内化肥工厂的厂长了。我端详着他发光的脸，又看看雪白的墙上写着的五个斗大的字“人民公社好”，感受到了一种更伟大的气魄。
    是的，伟大的气魄本来是生长在劳动人民身上的。但当有了党，人民作了国家的主人，用自己的双手创造自己的乐园的时候，这种气魄就更加浩大，可以震撼大地，可以排山倒海。去年全民大搞炼钢，胜利地超额完成1070万吨钢的任务；人民公社犹如初升的太阳，发射着炫眼的光芒；在社会主义建设事业中，英雄们提出要高山低头，要河水让路；劈山引水，喝令土地交出粮食，这都是伟大气魄的体现。
    在这大跃进的伟大时代里，伟大的气魄到处可见，不仅激励人们永远前进，从胜利走向胜利，同时，也从伟大的气魄中，清楚地看到了祖国最美好的明天。
