Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 8th: Henan Province has basically established a refractory material industrial network using indigenous methods. The metallurgical refractory products produced in the province can not only meet its own needs, but also support other regions.

Since the second half of last year, with the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry, Henan has made use of its abundant and diverse raw material sources and good quality to develop the refractory material industry like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, following the policy of "small-scale indigenous groups." Up to now, more than 320 new and expanded refractory material factories have been built throughout the province, with more than 970 various kilns. Last year, the province produced a total of 430,000 tons of various refractory products. At present, in addition to mass-producing clay bricks and partially producing high-alumina bricks, the province has also successfully trial-produced multi-clinker clay bricks, silica bricks, castable bricks, steel ladles, converter linings, etc., and is organizing batch production. At the same time, the brick types of each type of refractory brick are also constantly increasing. The Lihe Refractory Material Factory in Jiaozuo City alone currently produces more than 400 more types of clay bricks than last year.

Judging from the production of refractory materials in various places, the physical and chemical properties of the products of most factories have reached or basically reached the standards stipulated by the state. Due to the continuous improvement of the quality of refractory materials, the lifespan of small blast furnaces in various places has been extended from the past five or six days to twenty or thirty days, with the highest reaching more than two months of continuous production.

Henan Province's refractory material industry is further systematically consolidating and improving its work. Small-scale indigenous factories with better power and transportation conditions will carry out technical transformations and add some necessary equipment to achieve a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually transition from indigenous to foreign.

    河南耐火材料自给有余
    据新华社郑州8日电　河南省采用土办法基本建成耐火材料工业网，现在全省所产冶金耐火制品不仅可自给自足，而且还支援外地。
    去年下半年以来，随着钢铁工业的大跃进，河南各地运用原料来源丰富多种、质地良好的基本条件，采用“小土群”的方针，使耐火材料工业雨后春笋般发展起来。到目前止，全省已经新建、扩建耐火材料厂三百二十多个，拥有各种窑九百七十多座。全省去年共生产了各种耐火制品四十三万吨。现在，全省除了大量生产粘土砖和部分生产高铝砖以外，还试制成功多熟料粘土砖、矽砖、浇注砖、盛钢桶、转炉炉衬等，正在组织成批生产。同时，每类耐火砖的砖型也在不断增加，仅焦作市李河耐火材料厂目前生产的粘土砖型，就比去年增加了四百多种。
    从各地耐火材料的生产情况看来，大部分厂的产品理化性能都已达到或基本上达到了国家规定的标准。由于耐火材料质量的不断提高，各地小高炉寿命已经由过去的五、六天延长到二、三十天，最高的已达到连续生产两个多月。
    河南省的耐火材料工业正在进一步系统地进行巩固提高的工作，电源和交通条件较好的小土工厂，通过技术改造，增加一些必要设备，将做到土洋结合，逐步由土到洋。
