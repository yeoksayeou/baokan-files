Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, March 15th. Zhou Erfu, head of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, who is currently visiting Chile, hosted a luncheon on the 14th to welcome the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces delegation headed by Captain Mendoza (Castro's personal representative).

Zhou Erfu said in his speech, "The victory of the Cuban Revolution is one of the most significant events of 1959. The great victory of the Cuban Revolution has not only inspired the people of Latin American countries but also inspired the people of the world. The 650 million Chinese people express warm congratulations and firm support for the victory of the Cuban Revolution." Zhou Erfu also told the guests that recently, under the auspices of Mayor Peng Zhen, Beijing held a mass rally of 100,000 people to support the Cuban Revolution, and many other large cities in China have also held mass rallies. He proposed a toast to the victory of the Cuban people and the health of their leader, Prime Minister Castro.

Captain Mendoza said in his reply that it was a great pleasure to meet with Chinese brothers. The Chinese peasants had suffered a lot in the past, but all this no longer exists now. However, the people of many Latin American countries are still suffering. Cuban workers had no conditions to live a good life until the revolution of the "July 26th Movement" brought political freedom, economic independence, and social justice to the Cuban people. He said that the Cuban people will continue to struggle to build Cuba, "We will abide by the promises made to the Cuban people. Land reform is the primary task in the revolutionary program, because only land reform can lay the foundation for the development of the national economy." Captain Mendoza expressed his hope to visit China. He said that he wanted to learn from China's experience in land reform and agricultural collectivization.

He said, "The Chinese people, with rich revolutionary experience and a long history of cultural traditions, are marching forward on the broad road, building their happy life. China is a heroic and progressive country in the world, and the great victory of the Chinese revolution has inspired the people of Latin America."

At the banquet, Zhou Erfu presented gifts to the glorious fighters of the Cuban revolution.

  “7月26日运动”的革命给古巴人民带来了政治自由、经济独立以及社会正义以前，一直是没有条件过好日子的。他说，古巴人民将继续进行斗争以建设古巴，“我们将遵守对古巴人民所作的诺言。土地改革是革命纲领中的首要任务，因为只有土地改革才能为国民经济的发展打下基础”。门多萨上尉表示希望能访问中国。他说，他想学习中国在土地改革和农业集体化方面的经验。
