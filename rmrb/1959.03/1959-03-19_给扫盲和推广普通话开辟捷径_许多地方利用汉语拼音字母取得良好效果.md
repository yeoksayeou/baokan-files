Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: Over the past year, under the leadership of the relevant provincial Party committees and people's committees, significant progress has been made in many parts of the country in using the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet to assist in literacy and promote Putonghua (Standard Mandarin Chinese). The phonetic literacy (i.e., using the method of adding Pinyin to aid literacy) work in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and other provinces has achieved remarkable results and is now gradually moving towards comprehensive promotion. The work of promoting Putonghua in Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and other places has formed a mass movement. It is estimated that the number of workers and peasants across the country who have learned or are learning the Pinyin alphabet through phonetic literacy and the promotion of Putonghua is now over five million.

After the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme was approved by the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February 1958, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei successively conducted pilot programs using the Pinyin alphabet to assist in literacy. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education conducted pilot programs in five cities and counties—Pingyuan, Licheng, Sishui, Xin County, and Jinan—from late June to early August. It trained 1,799 teachers from people's schools, opened 141 classes and 13 groups, with a total of 5,274 students participating in the learning. The Hebei Provincial Department of Education conducted a pilot program from June 10th to August 20th with 261 workers in Baoding City and 259 farmers in Ding County. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education ran a pilot class in a production team in Qixia Mountain in Nanjing City and an agricultural cooperative in Jiangpu County in March, with a total of 46 students. The pilot experiences of the three provinces proved that: (1) The masses welcome the Pinyin alphabet; (2) It is not difficult for workers and peasants to learn the Pinyin alphabet, and they can generally learn it within one or twenty hours; (3) Using the Pinyin alphabet can indeed improve the teaching efficiency of Chinese characters, which is conducive to consolidating and expanding literacy achievements. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee approved and transmitted the reports of the Party organizations of the two provincial education departments on the pilot work in October and November, respectively, instructing all cities and counties to train teachers and gradually implement it. The Ministry of Education issued a "Notice on Introducing the Pilot Experience of Phonetic Alphabet Literacy in Shandong and Hebei Provinces" in December last year, suggesting that all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions consider carrying out phonetic literacy work. At present, more than a dozen cities and counties in Shandong and Hebei provinces have fully launched phonetic literacy work, and most counties and cities are also starting to carry it out. Due to phonetic considerations, the focus of Jiangsu Province's promotion of the Pinyin alphabet is on promoting Putonghua, while also consolidating literacy achievements.

The Henan Provincial Department of Education transferred and trained a group of literacy cadres in November last year as the backbone for promoting phonetic literacy throughout the province. The Henan Provincial Party Committee approved and transmitted the report of the Party organization of the Provincial Department of Education "Opinions on Consolidating and Expanding Literacy Achievements with the Hanyu Pinyin Alphabet Among the Broad Masses of Workers and Peasants in the Province This Winter and Next Spring" in December last year, instructing all localities, cities, and county Party committees to strengthen leadership and do a good job in this task. At present, most cities and counties in the province have made plans, and thirty or so cities and counties have fully launched it. For example, in Ye County, all young and middle-aged people have learned the Pinyin alphabet. One of the "Ten Initiatives" put forward at the Henan Provincial Congress of Literacy and Red and Expert Learning Activists in February was to require all literacy students and students of Red and Expert schools to actively learn and use the Pinyin alphabet to consolidate and expand literacy achievements.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Putonghua Promotion Work Committee, the Provincial Department of Education, and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a "Baquan On-site Conference on Promoting the Pinyin Alphabet to Consolidate and Expand Literacy Achievements and Promote Putonghua" in Baquan County from March 7th to 10th. The conference introduced the advanced experience of Baquan County and other cities and counties. More than 88,000 young and middle-aged people in Baquan County are learning the Pinyin alphabet, accounting for more than 82% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the county. More than 70,000 young and middle-aged people in Ning'an County are learning the Pinyin alphabet. Now, Heilongjiang Province has cultivated a teaching force of more than 100,000 people. A widespread, mass phonetic literacy movement is about to unfold throughout the province.

The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued a "Joint Directive on Launching a Province-wide Movement to Learn the Pinyin Alphabet and Putonghua" in December last year, requiring the universal teaching of the Pinyin alphabet among young and middle-aged people throughout the province to consolidate and expand literacy achievements and promote Putonghua. At present, the Zhuanghe County and other regions of this province are carrying out phonetic literacy work.

In March last year, Wu Shan Township in Datian County, Fujian, worked hard for fifty days and popularized Putonghua throughout the township. Now Datian County is promoting the Pinyin alphabet to consolidate and improve Putonghua. In August, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education held a Fujian Provincial Putonghua Promotion On-site Conference in Datian, promoting the experience of Datian County. In October, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee issued a "Directive on Vigorously Promoting Putonghua," requiring Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, make comprehensive plans, and quickly set off a upsurge of "everyone learning Putonghua, everyone speaking Putonghua, everyone promoting Putonghua" throughout the province. All cities and counties have formulated plans according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, and the province has launched a large-scale publicity and promotion movement for Putonghua. Now, speaking Putonghua is becoming a common social practice in many counties and cities in Fujian.

Since August last year, a mass movement to promote Putonghua has emerged in Guangdong Province. Chaoyang, Foshan, Jiangmen, Shantou, Zhongshan, Jieyang, Puning, Chao'an, and other counties and cities have achieved relatively significant results. The Provincial Department of Education plans to hold a commendation meeting for the promotion of the Pinyin alphabet and Putonghua throughout the province in April.

Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, launched a movement for the whole people to learn Putonghua and the Pinyin alphabet in August last year, which was very successful. In September, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education held a province-wide on-site conference in Kunshan to summarize and exchange experiences. At the end of October, Xinyi County became the second Putonghua county in Jiangsu Province. Jintan, Fengxian, Liyang, Wujin, Jiangyin and other places have successively set off a mass upsurge in learning Putonghua.

Other places that are vigorously promoting Putonghua by launching mass movements include Kaiyuan in Liaoning Province, Tonghe, Tailai, Ning'an, Kedong in Heilongjiang, Hejian, Baoding, Huaian in Hebei, Zouping, Fan County, Jining in Shandong, Linyi, Wanrong, Jishan in Shanxi, Wuxing People's Commune in Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, Taoyuan Township in Guiyang City, Daguan Garden Market in Jinan City, the catering industry in Xincheng District, Shanghai, and Chakou People's Commune in She County, Anhui Province, etc.

    给扫盲和推广普通话开辟捷径
    许多地方利用汉语拼音字母取得良好效果
    新华社18日讯　一年多来，全国许多地方利用汉语拼音字母帮助扫盲和推广普通话的工作，在有关的省委和省人民委员会的领导之下，获得了重要的进展。山东、河北、河南、黑龙江、辽宁等省的注音扫盲（即用加注拼音字母的方法扫盲）工作，已经取得显著成效，现在正在逐步走向全面推广。福建、广东、江苏以及其他一些地方推广普通话的工作已经形成群众运动。通过注音扫盲和推广普通话，工农群众中已经学过和正在学习拼音字母的人数，估计全国已在五百万以上。
    汉语拼音方案1958年2月经全国人民代表大会一届五次会议批准之后，江苏、山东、河北相继进行了利用拼音字母来帮助扫盲的试点工作。山东省教育厅于6月下旬至8月初在平原、历城、泗水、莘县、济南五个市、县进行试点。训练了民校教师一千七百九十九人；开办了一百四十一个班，十三个小组；参加学习的学员共有五千二百七十四人。河北省教育厅于6月10日至8月20日，在保定市的二百六十一名工人和定县的二百五十九名农民中进行试点。江苏省教育厅于3月间在南京市栖霞山的一个生产队和江浦县的一个农业社各办了一个试点班，合计学员四十六人。三个省的试点经验证明：（一）群众是欢迎拼音字母的；（二）工农群众学习拼音字母并没有什么困难，一般在一、二十小时之内可以学会；（三）利用拼音字母确实可以提高汉字的教学效率，有利于巩固和扩大扫盲成果。山东省委和河北省委分别于10月和11月批转了两省教育厅党组织关于试点工作的报告，指示各市县训练师资，逐步推行。教育部于去年12月发出了“关于介绍山东、河北两省拼音字母扫盲试点经验的通知”，建议各省、市、自治区考虑开展注音扫盲工作。目前山东、河北两省各有十几个市县，已经全面展开注音扫盲工作，多数县市也在着手进行。江苏省的推行拼音字母工作，由于语音的关系，重点在推广普通话，同时结合巩固扫盲成果。
    河南省教育厅于去年11月间调训了一批扫盲干部，作为在全省推行注音扫盲的骨干。河南省委于去年12月批转了省教育厅党组织“关于今冬明春在全省广大工农群众中用汉语拼音字母巩固和扩大扫盲成果的意见的报告”，指示各地、市、县委加强领导，做好这一项工作。现在全省大部分市县已作出规划，三十来个市县已经全面开展。例如叶县，青壮年已全部学过拼音字母。2月间召开的河南省扫盲及红专学习积极分子代表大会提出的“十项倡议”中，有一项就是要求全体扫盲学员和红专学校的学员积极学习和运用拼音字母，以巩固扩大扫盲成果。
    黑龙江省推广普通话工作委员会、省教育厅、共青团省委于3月7日至10日在拜泉县召开了“推行拼音字母巩固扩大扫盲成果、推广普通话拜泉现场会议”会上介绍了拜泉县和其他市县的先进经验。拜泉县有八万八千余名青壮年学习拼音字母，占全县青壮年总数的82％强。宁安县有七万余青壮年学习拼音字母。现在，黑龙江省已培养了一支十余万人的师资队伍。一个广泛的、群众性的注音扫盲运动即将在全省展开。
    辽宁省委和省人民委员会于去年12月发出“关于开展全民学习拼音字母和普通话运动的联合指示”，要求在全省的青壮年中普遍教学拼音字母，以巩固扩大扫盲成果，并推广普通话。目前这个省的庄河县等地区正在进行注音扫盲工作。
    去年3月，福建大田县吴山乡苦战五十天，全乡普及了普通话。现在大田县正在推行拼音字母，以巩固和提高普通话。8月间，福建省教育厅在大田召开福建省推广普通话现场会议，推广了大田县的经验。10月间，福建省委发出了“关于大力推广普通话的指示”，要求各级党委加强领导，全面规划，在全省范围内迅速掀起一个“人人学习普通话，人人讲普通话，人人推广普通话”的热潮。各市县根据省委指示都订出了规划，全省开展了一个大规模的宣传和推广普通话的运动。现在说普通话在福建很多县市正在形成一种普遍的社会风气。
    广东省从去年8月开始，出现了推广普通话的群众运动。潮阳、佛山、江门、汕头、中山、揭阳、普宁、潮安等县市的成绩比较显著。省教育厅准备在4月间召开全省推行拼音字母和推广普通话的评比会议。
    江苏省昆山县在去年8月间开展了全民学习普通话和拼音字母的运动，得到很大成功。9月间，江苏省教育厅在昆山召开了全省现场会议，总结交流经验。10月底，新沂县又成为江苏省的第二个普通话县。金坛、丰县、溧阳、武进、江阴等地相继掀起群众性的学习普通话热潮。
    以大搞群众运动的办法，大力推广普通话的，还有辽宁省的开原，黑龙江的通河、泰来、宁安、克东，河北省的河间、保定、怀安，山东的邹平、范县、济宁，山西省的临猗、万荣、稷山，四川省叙永县的五星人民公社，贵阳市的桃源乡，济南市的大观园商场，上海市新成区的饮食业，安徽省歙县的岔口人民公社等等。
