Before Dawn
—Starting with Comrade Foster's Letter
Liu Simu

It has been a month since I read Comrade Foster's enthusiastic letter to Comrade Mao Zedong. Every time I think of it, I can't help but be deeply moved, and I don't know how to express my love and respect for this veteran fighter of the international communist and workers' movement.

William Foster – when this glorious name is mentioned, the Chinese people are familiar with it and admire it wholeheartedly. The outstanding Marxist-Leninist works he wrote about the American and American workers' movement, and the many insightful essays analyzing American imperialism, are loved by Chinese readers and give them no small amount of inspiration. Foster and the heroic struggles and arduous experiences of the great American Communist Party he led are always in the minds of the Chinese people. We remember how, after 1948, when the black tide of anti-communist political persecution flooded the United States and more than a dozen leaders of the American Communist Party were imprisoned, the Chinese people warmly cared about and supported the American Communist Party's arduous struggle and angrily condemned the barbarous crimes of the American reactionaries. We remember how, around the time of the Hungarian incident in 1956, during the turbulent days of the international anti-Soviet and anti-communist counter-current, the Chinese people watched with concern the difficult situation and trends of the American Communist Party. We also remember how, in early 1957, during the 16th National Congress of the American Communist Party, we rejoiced over the decisive victory won by Comrade Foster and his comrades in a fierce struggle against the revisionists headed by Gates.

Now, Comrade Foster, whom we admire and have always remembered, has written a letter from his sickbed to our leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. This moving letter fully demonstrates the infinite loyalty of this glorious fighter and leader of the American working class to the cause of communism for sixty years; it demonstrates the courage and indomitable fighting spirit of Comrade Foster and his comrades in the face of the crazy persecution and continuous attacks of American imperialism; it demonstrates the uncompromising spirit of this defender of Marxist-Leninist principles in the struggle against all kinds of opportunism and revisionism, and his unwavering confidence in the proletariat. From this long letter, we also see Comrade Foster's noble proletarian internationalist spirit, his deep friendship with the Chinese people, and his ardent love and concern for China's socialist construction. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, from this passionate letter, we "see the soul of the great American Communist Party, the soul of the great American working class and the American people."

Yes, darkness still shrouds the United States, the situation of the American Communist Party is still difficult, and Comrade Foster himself is still "bound by two misdemeanor charges," facing the threat of imprisonment. Compared with the American reactionaries who possess police, courts, prisons, nuclear weapons and missiles, and monopolize parliament, newspapers, radio, and television, the American Communist Party, with its small number of members, seems weak. However, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The night has an end," socialism will surely defeat capitalism, and the United States will be no exception. In essence, in the long run, what has a bright future in the United States, and what is truly powerful, is the Communist Party, which represents the direction of historical development, the interests and demands of the people, and which now seems weak, and certainly not the Dulles and Pentagon generals and the gentlemen of the "Un-American Activities Committee," who represent the decadent reactionary forces, are extremely vicious, and seemingly powerful.

Moreover, even on the horizon of the United States, the fish-belly white of dawn is faintly visible. As far as the American Communist Party itself is concerned, since the likes of Gates were purged, the party's ranks have been purified, the party's unity has been strengthened, and the party's influence among the masses has increased significantly. At the same time, the development of the situation at home and abroad in the United States is also conducive to the progressive democratic forces in the United States, but greatly unfavorable to the reactionaries. The days of American imperialism are getting harder and harder.

For example, the fact that the American economic crisis broke out and continued to deepen in the second half of last year, and that it still hasn't really improved, has punctured the bubble of American "permanent prosperity" and American "exceptionalism," shattered myths such as "people's capitalism," and made the Keynesian plasters used to alleviate the crisis ineffective, and the corrosive effect of the long-term "prosperity" of the United States has gradually failed. Recently, the successive waves of strikes in the United States are not a manifestation of the increased combativeness and awareness of the working class?

For another example, in the peaceful competition between the two systems in the past year, after the Soviet Union launched three artificial earth satellites into the sky, followed by the amazing victory of cosmic rocket launches, coupled with the brilliant prospects of comprehensively building communism displayed by the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the grand ambition of catching up with the United States economically, as well as the indelible great achievements of the Chinese people's Great Leap Forward and the movement of people's communes, it has greatly boosted the morale of the people and diminished the prestige of American imperialism, making Washington tremble, frustrated, and panicky as if a great disaster is about to happen. The slanders of Dulles and his ilk against the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the curses against our people's communes reflect the inner fear of the American reactionaries. What's more, from Lebanon, Iraq, and the Taiwan Strait to nearby Cuba, American imperialism's war provocations and criminal activities of interfering in internal affairs have failed one after another, and even its "backyard" has been ignited with the raging fire of national revolution. This has thoroughly exposed the paper tiger nature of the American imperialist reactionaries in front of the American people and strengthened the fighting spirit of the American working people. Indeed, "American reactionary forces are now hitting walls everywhere, showing that their lifespan will not be very long" (Mao Zedong).

The sun of communism has already risen in the East, and even Africa, known as the "Dark Continent," has begun to see the dawn; the days from darkness to dawn in the United States will not be too far away either. The gentle east wind is blowing fiercely, and the socialist countries are full of spring colors. Although the United States, the birthplace of the "Cold War," is currently in the midst of a severe winter, spring will not be too late. By then, the struggle of the American Communist Party led by Comrade Foster will surely bear rich fruits!

### 破晓之前——从福斯特同志的信说起

    破晓之前
    ——从福斯特同志的信说起
    刘思慕
    读福斯特同志给毛泽东同志的热情洋溢的信已有一个月了。每一想起，总是禁不住深深感动，不知怎样才能表达我对这位国际共产主义运动和工人运动老斗士的热爱和敬意。
    威廉·福斯特，提起这个光辉的名字来，我们中国人民是熟识的，是十二分敬仰的。他所写的关于美国和美洲工人运动的出色的马列主义巨著，剖析美国帝国主义的许多精辟的论文，受到中国读者的喜爱和给他们不小的启发。福斯特和他所领导的伟大的美国共产党的英勇斗争和艰苦遭遇，更是时刻在中国人民的念中。我们记起，在1948年以后，当反共的政治迫害的黑潮泛滥全美，美共的十几位领袖被关进监牢里的时候，中国人民是怎样热切地关怀和声援美共的艰苦卓绝的斗争，怎样愤怒地谴责美国反动派的野蛮罪行。我们记起，在1956年匈牙利事件前后，国际反苏反共的逆流汹涌的日子里，中国人民又怎样以关切的心情注视着美共的艰辛的处境和它的动向。我们又记起，在1957年初，美共第十六次全国代表大会举行期间，我们怎样为福斯特同志和他的战友们在同以盖茨为首的修正主义分子的一场激烈斗争中所取得的决定性胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    现在，我们所敬佩的，一直怀念着的福斯特同志，从他的病榻上给我们的领袖毛泽东同志来信了。这封动人的书简，充分地表现了这位美国工人阶级的光荣战士和领袖六十年来献身于共产主义事业的无限忠诚；表现了福斯特同志和他的战友们在美帝国主义的疯狂迫害和不断打击下勇往直前、百折不挠的斗志；表现了这位马克思列宁主义原则的捍卫者在同形形色色的机会主义和修正主义的斗争中的不妥协精神和对无产阶级坚定不移的信心。从这封长信中，我们又看到了福斯特同志的崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，对中国人民的深厚的友情和对中国社会主义建设事业的热切的爱护和关怀。像毛泽东同志所说的那样，从这封充满热情的信中，我们“看到了伟大的美国共产党的灵魂，看到了伟大的美国工人阶级和美国人民的灵魂。”
    是的，黑夜还笼罩着美国，美共的处境还是艰苦的，福斯特同志本身就依然“受着两起治安罪起诉的束缚”，面临着牢狱的威胁。比起拥有警察、法院、监狱、核武器和导弹、垄断着议会、报纸、广播和电视的美国反动派来，党员人数不多的美国共产党看来是弱小的。但是，毛泽东同志说得好，“黑夜是有尽头的”，社会主义一定能战胜资本主义，美国也绝不会是例外。从本质来看，从长远来看，在美国，有光辉灿烂的前途的，真正强大的是代表着历史发展方向、人民利益和要求的，现在看来弱小的共产党，而决不是代表着腐朽的反动力量、穷凶极恶、貌似强大的杜勒斯之流以及五角大楼的将军们和
  “非美活动委员会”的老爷们。
    而且，就是在美国的地平线上，破晓的鱼肚白色也隐约可以看到了。以美共本身而论，自从盖茨之流被清除之后，党的队伍纯洁了，党的团结加强了，党在群众中的影响显著增长了。同时，美国国内外形势的发展，又有利于美国的进步的民主力量，而大不利于反动派。美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了。
    比方说吧，前年下半年美国经济危机爆发和继续深化，直到现在还是不见真正好转的事实，就戳穿了美国“永久繁荣”、美国“例外论”的牛皮，粉碎了“人民资本主义”一类的神话，使得用来缓和危机的凯恩斯主义一类狗皮膏药不见灵光，长期以来美国“繁荣”的腐蚀作用逐渐失效。最近，美国罢工浪潮的此伏彼起，翻腾澎湃，不正是工人阶级的斗争性和觉悟提高的表现吗？
    又比方说吧，在最近一年两个制度的和平竞赛中，苏联三个人造地球卫星上了天之后，继之以宇宙火箭发射的惊人胜利，再加上苏共第二十一次代表大会和苏联七年计划所展现出的全面建设共产主义的光辉前景和在经济上猛赶美国的雄伟气魄，以及中国人民大跃进和人民公社化运动无法抹煞的伟大成就，又大大长人民的志气，灭美帝国主义的威风，使得华盛顿战栗、沮丧、惶惶然如大祸之将至。杜勒斯之流对苏联七年计划的污蔑，对我国人民公社的诅咒，正是反映出美国反动派内心的惶恐。何况，从黎巴嫩、伊拉克、台湾海峡到近在咫尺的古巴，美帝国主义的战争挑衅和干涉内政的罪恶活动，失败接着失败，连它的“后院”也烧起了民族革命的熊熊烈火了。这又在美国人民的面前彻头彻尾地暴露出美帝国主义反动派的纸老虎原形，加强了美国劳动人民的斗志。的确，“美国反动势力现已到处碰壁，显示着他们的寿命不会很长了”（毛主席语）。
    共产主义的太阳已经在东方升起，连被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，也开始出现了曙光；美国从黑夜到黎明的日子也不会太远。骀荡的东风已在猛吹，社会主义国家正是满园春色，尽管“冷战”策源地的美国目前还在严冬之中，但春来也是不会太迟的。到那时，福斯特同志所领导的美国共产党的斗争一定会结出丰硕的果实来！
