    "Appreciation"
    Huang Shiheng
    Recently, I received a letter from a friend (who, like me, teaches Chinese in a middle school), discussing a thought-provoking issue. I will now transcribe the relevant part of the letter concerning this issue, word for word, below.
    …Colleagues usually exchange information and love to talk about their professional work because it is of interest to both of us.
    Here, I want to tell you about something unforgettable that happened to me.
    Needless to say, you know that before we analyze an article for students, we must first remove the obstacles in the words and sentences, which means we must explain the words and sentences. Once, I was explaining the word "appreciation" to the students. The meaning of this word is very simple: it means to observe and enjoy because of liking. After explaining it this way, I gave an example to make it clearer.
    I said to the students that one can use "appreciation" for things that are pleasing to the eye and ear, such as flowers, movies, plays, all works of art, etc., but one cannot use this word for things that are disgusting, such as one cannot say "appreciate manure"…
    That night, before lights out, I heard the students in my class discussing this word in the dormitory.
    One student said: "I say the teacher's example is wrong. How can manure be something disgusting? It can be used as fertilizer, it is the treasure of treasures."
    Another student said: "But no one has ever said they appreciate manure!"
    "You tell me, in the countryside, manure piles are like mountains, can't we say we appreciate these pagoda-like manure piles? Painters paint them on canvases, photographers capture them in their lenses, and poets even write poems to sing about them, can't we use 'appreciation'?"
    "Not necessarily."
    "Not necessarily, doesn't equal definitely not! In my opinion, we definitely can! Tomorrow we will discuss it with the teacher again."
    I was correcting homework at the time, and after hearing this debate, I couldn't continue correcting. Obviously, the student who advocated using "appreciation" was correct. But why did I say that? I didn't think carefully about the example I gave beforehand, it can be said that it was an impromptu utterance in class, but then I thought: If I had also participated in manure accumulation, or was very concerned about manure accumulation, and had the same deep feelings for fertilizer as the farmers, would I still have made such an impromptu utterance?
    Gradually, four words began to emerge in my chaotic brain: emotional problem. And these four words, just like the way movie titles are sometimes projected on the screen, started very small, then quickly moved closer, rushing towards the audience, becoming very large words, and finally fixed on the screen.
    These four big words were jumping around in front of my eyes. I couldn't help but repeatedly say to myself: Ah, it's an emotional problem!
    What do you say?…
    I read the above passage twice and thought about it for a long time.

    “欣赏”
    黄世衡
    最近，接到一个朋友的信（他和我一样，在一个中学里教语文），谈到一个发人深省的问题。现在把信中有关这个问题的叙述一字不苟地写在下面。
    ……同行之间互通信息，大抵总爱谈谈本职工作，因这是你我都感兴趣的。
    这里，我要告诉你一件使我难以忘怀的事。
    不用说你也知道，我们在向学生分析一篇文章之前，先得扫除字句上的障碍，这就是说，要解词释句。有一次，我向学生解释“欣赏”一词。这个词的意义很浅近，就是因喜爱而观赏的意思。我这样解释之后，为了说得清楚些，便举了例子。
    我向学生说，对喜闻乐见的事物，可以用欣赏，比如花、影剧、一切艺术品等等，但对厌恶的事物就不能用这个词，如不能说欣赏大粪……
    这天晚上熄灯之前，我听到我教的那班的学生在宿舍里议论这个词。
    一个学生说：“我说老师举那个例不对。大粪怎么是使人厌恶的东西呢？它可以做肥料，是宝中之宝。”
    另一学生说：“可从来没听谁说过欣赏大粪呀！”
    “你说，农村中积肥堆如山，可不可以说欣赏这宝塔一般的粪堆呢？画家们把它画上画布，摄影师把它摄入镜头，诗人们还作诗歌唱它，难道不能用欣赏？”
    “不一定能用。”
    “不一定，不等于一定不！依我看一定能用！明天我们再和老师研究研究。”
    我当时正在批改作业，听了这番争论，却怎么也改不下去了。显然，主张能用欣赏的学生的说法是正确的。但我为什么要那样讲呢？我举那个例子，事先并没有怎样细想，可以说是在课堂上临时脱口而出，但是我继而一想：假如我也参加过积肥，或者对积肥非常关心，对肥料，有农民那样的深厚感情，那我是不是还会来这么一个脱口而出呢？
    渐渐地，我纷乱的脑子里，开始涌出四个字来：感情问题。而且这四个字，就像银幕上有时映出影片名字的情形那样，开始时候字很小，随即很快地推近，向观众扑来，变成很大的字，最后固定在银幕上。
    这四个很大的字，在我眼前乱跳。我不禁反复自语：是啊，是感情问题！
    你说呢？……
    我把上面这部分叙述看了两遍，想了很久。
