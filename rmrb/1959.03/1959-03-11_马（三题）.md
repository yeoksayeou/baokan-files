    Horses: An Ode
    People often use "one horse leading the way" to praise advanced workers, and call the nationwide people's leap forward "ten thousand horses galloping." Indeed, besides the horse, we can hardly find other more suitable animals to symbolize our Great Leap Forward.
    The entire physical structure of the horse is perfectly suited to the "unobstructed" galloping activity. Its build is tall, its body strong and full, containing abundant energy. The torso is straight, the waist is oval, like a streamlined shell. The four feet are light and slender, and when it gallops, it is like an arrow released from a bowstring. Combined with its thin and pointed ears, large and bright eyes, soft mane, and silky fluttering tail, it becomes the embodiment of beauty and strength.
    The horse is not only beautiful in appearance, but it also possesses a spirit of fearlessness and unwavering progress. It is also so kind, never bullying small animals; so gregarious, loving collective life; so docile, accepting human control.
    The horse has always been a close and loyal friend of mankind. From the distant ancient times, before written records existed, it began to follow mankind to labor and fight. It has indeed made a "meritorious contribution" to the development of human society.
    Today, human society has entered the age of artificial planets, but we still need horses to serve us. Along with airplanes, trains, and cars, horses are still an important means of transportation. In the Soviet Union, horses bred and trained with superior breeds can pull more than ten tons at a time, and some can run one kilometer per minute. Although far behind mechanical power, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs, the horse is still an important force in helping us build socialism.
          So-so
    It is probably impossible to verify why the adjective "so-so" is used to describe carelessness. It's probably like this: for example, a child draws a horse, but due to carelessness or impure technique, what is drawn looks like both a horse and a tiger, so it is called "so-so."
    As for perception, even a child would not "call a deer a horse." From a biological point of view, the two have taken opposite extremes on the path of evolution.
    Horses eat grass, tigers eat meat, and their physical structure and living habits are completely adapted to this diet.
    Due to running and foraging in the vast grasslands and escaping from other predators, the horse's body has developed to be tall, with an oval waist and slender, powerful legs with single-toed hooves. Tigers, on the other hand, live by preying on other animals, always hiding in forests or dense grass, with short and sturdy bodies, round waists, and sharp claws.
    If the horse's legs are long, the neck must also be long, otherwise it would be difficult to eat the grass on the ground. At the same time, if the neck is long, raising its head can see further. In addition, its eyes are on both sides of its face, and the angle between the optical axes of the eyes is more than 100 degrees, so it can see very wide and far. The tiger is the opposite, with a short neck, which is more convenient for it to prey on other animals. The tiger's eyes are on the front of its face, and the angle between the optical axes of the eyes is only a dozen degrees, so it sees things very accurately.
    Horses' incisors can cut grass, and canines are absent (female) or very small (male); while tigers' incisors are not very developed, but their canines are as sharp as a knife. The horse's cheek teeth have high crowns; the tooth surface has curved grooves, which are both wear-resistant and durable. The tiger's cheek teeth are sharp, like three-pointed chisels, which is obviously a good adaptation for eating meat.
    Plant digestion is relatively difficult, and the horse's intestines are curved and long; meat digestion is relatively easy, and the tiger's intestines are relatively short.
    Not only are their physical structures different, but their living habits are also different. Horses are peace-loving and like to live in groups; while tigers are aggressive and very isolated.
        From Forest to Grassland
    Modern horses have a beautiful image and gallop forward without fear, but this situation has not been "always the case."
    Thanks to the efforts of paleontologists over the centuries, especially the research of Russian paleontologist Kovalevsky, the evolutionary history of the horse is the most detailed, thorough, and systematic of all animals.
    As early as 50 million years ago, in primitive shrub forests, there lived a kind of "dawn horse." They were only as big as small hounds, with curved bodies, four toes on the forelimbs, and three toes on the hind limbs; their molars were low and small, and the folds on them were also very simple. All of this was well-adapted to its living environment. It could jump freely in the wet and soft soil of the shrub forest, eating the tender and juicy leaves of the shrubs, without much chewing.
    After thirty to forty million years, the forest area gradually disappeared, and vast grasslands began to form on the earth, and corresponding to this was a kind of three-toed horse.
    The three-toed horse is a broad term, representing a transitional type from dawn horse to modern horse (but this does not mean that it is the direct ancestor of the modern horse). It is about the size of a small donkey. Each of its feet has three toes. When it gallops on the hard grassland, its weight mainly falls on the middle toe, and when it walks in the swampy area, its two side toes can be opened to form a wide foot, so that it does not slip or get stuck in the mud. They began to eat dry grass and hard grasses, and their teeth gradually became stronger and sturdier, while the crowns increased and the tooth surfaces had folds.
    The appearance of modern horses is only a million years ago. They are already completely grassland animals. Their bodies are taller, their legs are thinner and longer, and there is only one middle toe left, and it has been specially developed, so they can gallop on the vast grasslands. They eat grass with sand from the grassland, and their teeth are stronger, the crowns are higher, and the folds on the tooth surfaces are more pronounced.
    The evolutionary history of the horse is the process of life from forest to grassland. The body size changes from small to large, the legs from short to long, the toes from general to special, and the teeth from low to advanced.

    马（三题）
    刘后贻
          马　颂
    人们常常用“一马当先”来赞美先进工作者，而将全国人民的跃进叫作“万马奔腾”。的确，除了马以外，我们很难找到其他更合适的动物来象征我们的大跃进了。
    马的整个身体构造完全适宜于那种“所向无空阔”的奔腾活动。它的身材高大，身体结实而丰满，蕴蓄着充沛的精力。身躯挺直，腰围椭圆，就像一颗流线型的炮弹。四只脚轻捷而又细长，飞驰起来，就像箭脱了弦似的。再配上细而尖的耳朵，大又亮的眼睛，柔嫩的鬣毛和丝丝飘拂的马尾，它便成了美与力的化身。
    马不只是形象优美而已，它还具有无所畏惧、一往直前的精神。它又是那么善良，从不欺侮弱小的动物；那么合群，热爱着集体的生活；那么驯顺，接受人对它的驾驭。
    马一直是人类亲密而又忠实的朋友。从遥远的古代，还没有文字记载的时候，它就开始跟随着人类一起去劳动和战斗了。它对人类社会的发展，实在是立了一分“汗马功劳”的。
    今天人类社会已经进入了人造行星时代，然而我们仍然需要马为我们服务。和飞机、火车、汽车一道，马仍然是我们的重要运输工具。在苏联，经过良种繁育和训练出来的马，有的每一次能够拉十多吨重，有的每一分钟可以跑一公里远。虽然比起机械动力来相差很多，但是土洋并举，两条腿走路，马仍然是帮助我们建设社会主义的一分重要力量。
          马马虎虎
    为什么说粗心大意要用“马马虎虎”的形容词，现在恐怕无从考证。大约是：比方小孩画马，由于粗心或者技术不纯熟，画出来，又像马，又像老虎，所以就叫马马虎虎了。
    至于在认识上，即使是小孩，也不会“指虎为马”的。而从生物学的观点来看，两者在演化的道路上，却更是走上了两个相反的极端。
    马是吃草的，老虎是吃肉的，它们的身体构造和生活习性和这种食性是完全适应的。
    由于在辽阔无际的草原奔跑觅食以及逃避被其它猛兽侵害，马的身体发展得很高大，腰围椭圆，脚细长有力，具有单趾的蹄。而老虎则是以扑杀别的动物为生，总是隐蔽在山林或密草丛中，身体矮壮，腰围浑圆，具有锋利的爪子。
    马的腿长了，颈也不能不长，不然，它就很难吃到地上的草。同时，颈长了，抬起头来，可以看得更远。加上它的眼睛生在脸的两边，眼睛光轴间的角有一百多度，可以看得很广很远。而老虎却相反，颈很短，这对它扑食别的动物更方便些。老虎的眼睛生在脸的正前方，眼睛光轴间的角只有十几度，所以看东西看得很准。
    马的门齿会切草，犬齿没有（雌）或者很小（雄）；而老虎的门齿则不很发达，犬齿却尖利得像一把刀。马的颊齿齿冠很高；齿面有弯弯曲曲的沟槽，既耐磨，又经久。老虎的颊齿则很尖利，好像三尖的小凿刀似的，这对于它食肉显然是一种很好的适应。
    植物消化是比较困难的，马的肠子弯而且长；肉类消化是比较容易的，老虎的肠子就比较短了。
    不仅身体构造不同，它们的生活习性也是各异的。马是爱好和平，喜欢群居的；而老虎则侵略成性，而且是很孤立的。
        从森林到草原
    现代的马形象优美，奔驰起来所向无前，然而这种情况并不是“自古如斯”的。
    感谢古生物学家们几百年来的努力，特别是俄国古生物学家科瓦列夫斯基的研究，马的演化史在所有动物中是被研究得最详尽、最彻底、最系统的了。
    早在五千万年以前，在原始灌木林中，生活着一种“始马”。它们只有小猎狗那么大，身体弯曲，前肢四趾，后肢三趾；它的臼齿又低又小，上面的折皱也很简单。这一切对它的生活环境是很适应的。它可以在灌木林中潮湿而柔软的泥土上跳跃自如，吃着灌木柔嫩多汁的树叶，而无需太多的咀嚼。
    这样经过了三四千万年，森林地带逐渐消失，地球上开始形成了辽阔无际的草原地带，而与此相适应的是一种三趾马。
    三趾马是一个广泛的名词，它代表着一种从始马到现代马的过渡类型（但这并不等于说它就是现代马的直系祖先）。它的大小相当于一头小毛驴。它的每只脚都有三个趾头。当它在坚硬的草原上奔驰的时候，它的体重主要落在中趾上，而当它在湖沼地带散步的时候，它的两个侧趾又可以张开，构成宽大的脚掌，使它不致滑倒，或者陷身泥淖。它们开始吃干草和坚硬的禾本科植物，牙齿也就逐渐强大、结实，同时齿冠增高，齿面也有了折皱了。
    现代马的出现，还不过一百万年。它们已经完全是一种草原性动物。它们的身体更加高大，脚变得更细长，趾也只剩下一个中趾，而且获得特殊的发展，因而可以在辽阔的草原上驰骋了。它们完全吃草原上带沙土的草类，牙齿更加壮大、结实，齿冠更高，齿面的折皱更加显著。
    马的演化史也就是从森林到草原的生活过程。身材由小到大，腿由短到长，脚趾由一般到特殊，而牙齿由低级到高级地变化着。
