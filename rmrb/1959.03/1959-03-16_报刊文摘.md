There's a Lot to Be Said for Accounting

Accounting is very beneficial, accounting is absolutely necessary, and there is a lot to be said for accounting. We oppose the "accounting faction" because they start from conservative ideas, calculate negative accounts, calculate accounts that promote regression, and hinder the advancement of construction. But we revolutionaries must also do accounting, we calculate positive accounts, promotion accounts, so as to ensure that we can leap forward faster, leap forward better and more comprehensively.

Without accounting, one is ignorant. If one is ignorant, it is impossible to increase confidence and courage; if one is ignorant, it is inevitable to confuse priorities and lose direction.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "We often hear some comrades say the following sentence when they cannot bravely accept work tasks: 'I'm not sure.' Why are they not sure? Because he does not have a regular understanding of the content and environment of this work, or he has never been in contact with this type of work, or he has not been in contact with it much, so there is no way to talk about the regularity of this type of work." It can be seen that a regular understanding of the content and environment of work can greatly improve confidence and courage in work. How can we have a regular understanding of the content and environment of work? In addition to relying on practice and repeated observation of objective things, it is necessary to further conduct research based on the materials obtained from observation through synthesis and analysis, to transform perceptual knowledge into rational knowledge, and to elevate from phenomenon to essence. Accounting is actually a comprehensive analysis and research work. If the accounting is done well, comprehensively, and correctly, it can help us have a regular understanding of the content and environment of the work, and we will feel confident or become more confident, which will help improve confidence and courage.

However, accounting also depends on how it is calculated.

Some people become more and more confused the more they calculate, the more timid they become, and the more they feel that there is no way. Why? Because what they are calculating is a dead account, not a living account. They only calculate the difficult account, not the account of overcoming difficulties; they only calculate small accounts, short-term accounts, and economic accounts, not a large account, long-term account, and political account. If you calculate accounts this way, you can only be blinded by a leaf and not know the sky, and you will be confused and frightened.

Some people feel more and more that they can sit back and relax, thinking that everything can be easily obtained, why? Because what they are calculating is an ideal account, not a practical account; they only calculate accounts with favorable conditions, and do not calculate accounts with unfavorable conditions. This kind of calculation will also make people more and more confused.

Therefore, we say that there is a lot to be said for accounting. The way to do this article is to calculate living accounts, not just dead accounts; to calculate both existing accounts and developing accounts; to calculate large accounts and long-term accounts, and also small accounts and short-term accounts; to calculate economic accounts and also political accounts; to calculate both accounts with unfavorable conditions and accounts with favorable conditions; to calculate both difficult accounts and accounts of measures and methods to overcome difficulties; to calculate both the accounts of things and the accounts of people. If the calculation is clear, the distinction is clear, the view is comprehensive, the grasp is accurate, and the essence is mastered, then the accounting is done well and plays a positive role.

See Both the "Cartload of Firewood" and Examine the "Tip of a Hair"

In our actual life, there is often a contrast between being comprehensive and one-sided, and between dialectics and metaphysics in our view of achievements and shortcomings. Dialectics tells us that the development of things always manifests as a unity of opposites. In the work of achieving great achievements, there will also be some small shortcomings. The problem lies in making a specific analysis, distinguishing which is the mainstream and which is the tributary, which is the nine fingers and which is one finger. If you only see nine fingers and don't see one finger, and regard nine fingers as ten fingers, that is one-sided. Conversely, if you only see one finger and don't see nine fingers, and regard one finger as ten fingers, that is even more wrong. "Generalizing ten from nine," affirming everything, will lead to stagnation. Conversely, "generalizing ten from one," denying everything, will completely reverse things.

China's Great Leap Forward in 1958 achieved extremely great results, but it cannot be said that there were no small shortcomings in all the work. However, these shortcomings, in the final analysis, are only a problem of less than one finger out of ten fingers. From the perspective of dialectics, we must see both great achievements and small shortcomings; affirm achievements, overcome shortcomings, clarify the direction, have full confidence, and constantly leap from victory to greater victory.

In the chapter "Liang Hui Wang" of "Mencius," there is a sentence that says: "Eyesight is sharp enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but cannot see a cartload of firewood." That is to say, something as small as a hair tip can be seen clearly, but a cartload of firewood cannot be seen. This sentence can be used to describe those one-sided views that only see trees but not the forest. Using a metaphysical method to look at problems often manifests as being able to examine the "tip of an autumn hair" but not seeing the "cartload of firewood"; instead of seeing both the "cartload of firewood" and examining the "tip of an autumn hair." Therefore, the "tip of an autumn hair" is often regarded as the "cartload of firewood." This one-sided view often leads people to lose confidence and direction, or even to the danger of going in the opposite direction from their starting point.

This linearization, rigidity, absolutization, and isolated fragmentation of looking at problems are the characteristics of metaphysics. Looking at things from a metaphysical point of view always manifests as either looking at only one side or looking at only the other side; either affirming everything or denying everything. Once the dialectical process of objective things is reflected in the metaphysical mind, it immediately becomes a one-sided absolutization. From this perspective, anything that is good is absolutely good, eternally good; anything that is bad is absolutely bad, eternally bad. They don't know that under certain conditions, bad things can turn into good things, and good things can also lead to bad results. They only know that failure is failure, and they don't know that failure can become the "mother of success"; they only know that mistakes are mistakes, and they don't know that mistakes are often the guide of correctness. We advocate learning to look at problems with the method of "nine fingers and one finger," and to look at problems with the viewpoint of "two points," which is to overcome that metaphysical one-sidedness and look at problems with a comprehensive dialectical viewpoint; it is to require people to learn to skillfully use materialist dialectics in all practical work.

Discipline and Freedom are a Unity of Opposites

All social activities of people, in the final analysis, are nothing more than class struggle or production struggle. The ultimate goal of these two struggles is to change people's unfree or not very free state of life and spirit into a free or more free state. The victory of the socialist revolution marks the freedom of people from the rule and oppression of the exploiting classes.

In order to smoothly carry out the struggle and achieve the victory of the struggle, people must organize themselves in the struggle and act in unison to strive for common freedom. And to organize, there must be common disciplines to maintain and guide people's consistent and collective actions. The necessity of discipline lies in incorporating people's actions in the struggle into a unified and most effective battle in order to win common freedom. The freedom people gain in the struggle is the result of consistent action in compliance with common disciplines. First, there are common disciplines to be followed, and then there is common freedom for people. Of course, on the other hand, discipline also restricts certain freedoms of people in the struggle process. However, what discipline restricts is the kind of "freedom" that is not conducive to people jointly striving for freedom. Therefore, discipline and freedom are unified and opposed, and their unity is fundamental and their opposition is relative.

It is natural and reasonable for people to unify their actions with discipline in order to better carry out the struggle and strive for collective freedom. However, some people often have a fear of the word "discipline"; at the mention of discipline, they think it is not free. Between discipline and freedom, they only see the opposing side, and do not see the basic unified side of the two.

The "four transformations" (organizational militarization, action combatization, life collectivization, and management democratization) of the People's Commune are necessary and correct measures to adapt to the more highly collectivized production and life of the commune and the large-scale production struggle. Iron facts prove that farmers have gained and are continuing to gain freedoms never before seen in history. For example, there is freedom to wholeheartedly engage in labor production, freedom to fully display personal wisdom and talent in production, freedom to build a happy and fulfilling life, and freedom from hunger, cold, poverty, and disease, etc. Fundamentally speaking, what farmers have lost today is the farmer's lack of freedom, and what they have gained today is true, great, and sublime freedom.

    报刊文摘
    算账里面大有文章
    算账大有好处，算账万分必要，算账里面大有文章。我们反对算账派，因为他们从保守思想出发，算消极账，算促退账，妨碍建设事业的前进。但我们革命者也要算账，我们算的是积极账，促进账，从而保证我们能跃进得更快，跃进得更好更全面。
    不算账，心中无数。心中无数，就不能提高信心和增强勇气；心中无数，就难免轻重倒置和迷失方向。
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说过：“常常听到一些同志在不能勇敢接受工作任务时说出来的一句话：没有把握。为什么没有把握呢？因为他对这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解，或者他从来就没有接触过这类工作，或者接触得不多，因而无从谈到这类工作的规律性。”可见，对于工作的内容和环境有规律性的了解，很能够提高工作的信心和勇气。怎样才能对工作的内容和环境有规律性的了解？除了要依靠实践，依靠对客观事物反复的观察之外，更要进一步根据观察所得的材料经过综合和分析来进行研究，化感性为理性，从现象提高到本质。算账，其实也就是一项综合分析的研究工作。算账算得好，算得全面，算得正确，可以帮助我们对工作的内容和环境有规律性的了解，就会感到有把握或者把握大起来，因而也就有助于提高信心和增强勇气。
    但是，算账也要看怎么个算法。
    有些人越算越糊涂，越算越胆小，越算越觉得没有办法。为什么？因为他算的是死账，不是算的活账，他只算困难账，没有算能够克服困难的账，只算小账、近账和经济账，没有算一笔大账、远账和政治账。这样去算账，只能够一叶蔽目不知有天，算得糊里糊涂、提心吊胆。
    有些人越算越觉得可以高枕无忧，以为一切皆可以探囊取物，唾手可得，为什么呢？因为他们算的是理想账，不是算的实际账；他们只算有利条件的账，而没有去算不利条件的账。这样的算法，也会使人越算越糊涂的。
    因此，我们说，算账里面大有文章。这文章的做法，就是要算活账，不要光算死账；就是既要算现成的账，更要算发展的账；要算大账、远账，也要算小账、近账；要算经济账更要算政治账；既算不利条件账，更算有利条件账；既算困难账，更算克服困难的措施与办法的账；既要算物的账，又要算人的账。算得清，分得明，看得全面，抓得准确，掌握了本质，算账才算是算到了家，才起了积极的作用。

    既见“舆薪”，又察“秋毫”
    在我们的实际生活中，对于成绩和缺点的看法上，常常存在着全面和片面、辩证法和形而上学之间的对立。辩证法告诉我们，事物的发展，总是表现为一个对立的统一过程。在获得巨大的成绩的工作中，也会出现个别小的缺点。问题在于要作具体分析，分清哪是主流、哪是支流，哪是九个指头、哪是一个指头。如果只看见九个指头，看不见一个指头，把九个指头当成十个指头，那是片面的。反之，如果只看见一个指头，看不见九个指头，把一个指头当成十个指头，那就更是错误的了。“以九概十”，肯定一切，就会停滞不前。反之，“以一概十”，否定一切，就会把事情完全弄反了。
    我国1958年的大跃进，取得了极其伟大的成绩，但也不能说，在所有的一切工作中一点小缺点也没有发生。但是，这些缺点，归根到底，只是十个指头中不到一个指头的问题。从辩证法的观点看来，就要既见大成绩，又见小缺点；肯定成绩，克服缺点，方向明确，信心百倍，不断地从胜利跃向更大的胜利。
    “孟子”“梁惠王”篇里，有一句话说：“明足以察秋毫之末，而不见舆薪。”也就是说，小如一根毫毛也看得清，却看不见一大车柴薪。这句话可以借用来形容那些只见树木不见森林的片面观点。用形而上学的方法看问题，常常表现为能察“秋毫之末”，但不见“舆薪”之大；而不是既见“舆薪”之大，又察“秋毫之末”。因而就常常是把“秋毫之末”，当成了“舆薪”之大。这种片面观点，常常是使人小则丧失信心，迷失方向；大则有走向和自己出发点相反方向去的危险。
    这种看问题的直线化、刻板化、绝对化和孤立片面化，是形而上学的特点。用形而上学观点看事物，总是表现为要就是只看这一面，要就是只看那一面；要就是肯定一切，要就是否定一切。客观事物的辩证过程，一旦被反映到形而上学的头脑里，立刻就变成了片面的绝对化。在这种眼光看来，任何事情，好就是绝对的好，永远的好；坏就是绝对的坏，永远的坏。他们不知道，在一定的条件下，坏事可以变为好事，好事也可以引出坏的结果。他们只知道失败就是失败，不知道失败还可以成为“成功之母”；只知道错误就是错误，不知道错误常常是正确的先导。我们主张要学会用“九个指头和一个指头”的方法看问题，用“两点论”的观点看问题，就是要克服那种形而上学的片面性，用辩证法的全面观点看问题；就是要求人们在一切实际工作中，学会熟练地运用唯物辩证法。

    纪律与自由是矛盾的统一
    人们的一切社会活动，归根到底，无非是进行阶级斗争或生产斗争。这两种斗争的最终目的，皆在于改变人们生活的和精神的不自由或不甚自由的状态为自由或更自由的状态。社会主义革命的胜利，标志着人们获得免于受剥削阶级统治和压迫的自由。
    为了顺利地进行斗争和取得斗争的胜利，人们在斗争中就必须组织起来，为争得共同的自由而一致行动。而组织起来，又必须有共同遵守的纪律，以维系和指导人们一致的、集体的行动。纪律之所以必要，在于把斗争中人们的行动，纳入统一的、效果最大的战斗中去，以便争得共同的自由。人们在斗争中获得的自由，乃是在遵守共同的纪律下，一致行动的结果。先有共同遵守的纪律，才有人们共同的自由。当然，在另一方面，纪律在斗争过程中，又约束着人们的某些自由。但，纪律所约束的，乃是不利于人们共同地去争取自由的那种“自由”。因之，纪律与自由是统一而又对立的，其统一是基本的，对立是相对的。
    人们为了更好地进行斗争，争取集体的自由，用纪律以统一人们的行动，乃是自然而合理的事。但某些人对于“纪律”一词，往往有着畏惧心理；一提起纪律，就认为不自由。他们在纪律与自由间，看到的只是对立的一面，看不到二者基本的统一的一面。
    人民公社的“四化”（组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化），乃是适应公社生产和生活更高程度集体化的、巨大规模的生产斗争所必要的和正确的措施。铁般的事实证明，农民已获得了而且正在继续获得历史上从来未有过的自由。譬如，有了一心一意进行劳动生产的自由，有了在生产中充分发挥个人智慧才能的自由，有了建设美满幸福生活的自由，也有了免于饥寒贫病的自由，等等，从根本上讲，今天农民失去的是农民的不自由，今天获得的，才是真正的、伟大崇高的自由。
