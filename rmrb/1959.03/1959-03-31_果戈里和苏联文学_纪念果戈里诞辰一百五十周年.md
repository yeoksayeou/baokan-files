Gogol and Soviet Literature
    —Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Gogol’s Birth
    Soviet Professor Ni·Stepanov
    The name of the great Russian writer Gogol and his genius works are truly immortal. Gogol regarded serving the motherland and the people as his bounden duty. Exposing the exploitative system with satire, mocking the despicable life, while at the same time attacking the social injustice that oppresses and humiliates people with a flame of irreconcilable anger, and filling his creations with confidence in the great and beautiful future of the motherland and the people, made Gogol's work full of vigorous vitality.
    Leonid Leonov, one of the prominent representatives of Soviet literature, spoke with good reason at the unveiling ceremony of the Gogol monument in Moscow in 1952, when commemorating the centenary of Gogol's death. He said: "It seems that the distance between us and the era of Nikolai Gogol is not a century, but a whole geological age. Since that era, everything in our country has changed, from the way of life of the people to certain aspects of the national character... But, like our grandfathers, we also feel infinitely close to this inspiring poet..."
    Gogol's influence on the development of the entire Russian literary history that followed is immense. As the founder of Russian classical realism, he had a beneficial influence on writers such as Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Ostrovsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Chernyshevsky, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and many others. Gogol's humanistic ideas, his fearless resistance to the despicable and filthy social system of the time, his love for the people and his sympathy for the fate of ordinary little people—all of this enriched and nourished Russian literature, and not only Russian literature.
    Gogol's artistic techniques and his vivid and colorful writing are of particularly great significance. When inheriting the excellent traditions of their motherland's classical literature, Soviet writers have always studied Gogol's works, his superb artistic language techniques, and his profound and meticulous mastery of the people's language, both in the past and now. At the same time, while drawing on this tradition, they have adapted it to the new living conditions in their own way, and have developed those principles from Gogol in the direction of socialist realism.
    Soviet literature has inherited Gogol's basic teachings and his love for the people and the excellent qualities of mankind.
    In the works of Gorky, the founder of socialist realism literature, the concrete reflection of the Gogol tradition can be seen. Gorky gave a lofty evaluation of Gogol's genius and more than once suggested that Soviet writers learn from this great master of artistic language. In 1930, Gorky included Gogol in the ranks of those world-renowned satirical writers who were "meticulously truthful and strict in exposing the misdeeds of the ruling class..." The themes of glorifying heroic deeds in Gorky's creations also echo Gogol's traditions. A. Lunacharsky wrote: "Gogol, like Gorky, fanatically pursued beauty." Gorky's early short stories, with their vivid romantic characters, inevitably remind people of the protagonists in Gogol's works. Gogol's principle of artistic typification was of great significance to the maturity of Gorky's creations.
    Gogol's satirical principles, especially his dramatic art, also had a significant impact on another most famous representative of Soviet literature, Mayakovsky. Mayakovsky's "The Bedbug" and "The Bathhouse" developed the comedy techniques of "The Government Inspector" on a new basis—the combination of the bizarre of comedy with the generalization and typification of satire. Soviet comedy, in general, owes much to Gogol. Plays such as Romashov's "The End of Krivorylsk" and the comedic works of many other Soviet dramatists have drawn on the outstanding experience of the comedy master Gogol.
    In Ilf and Petrov's novels "The Twelve Chairs" and "The Golden Calf", as well as in many other satirical works by Soviet writers, Gogol's satirical tradition can be found. I think that the unreserved humor used by Sholokhov in "Virgin Soil Upturned" is also close to Gogol's profoundly popular humor.
    Another heroic tradition from Gogol's folk narrative poem "Taras Bulba", its influence on Soviet literature is also clearly manifested. Take one of the early works of Soviet literature, Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood," an epic glorifying the civil war, as an example. Here, the foundation of this epic is permeated with the spirit of Gogol's works, which places the heroic behavior of the masses of the people in the first place, not individuals. The strong and powerful depiction of character images and the exciting narrative language also remind people of Gogol's works. Even the poetic rhythm that determines the style of "The Iron Flood" also comes from Gogol's techniques.
    Gogol's creative experience also had a significant impact on the Soviet prose writer Sholokhov. The heroic passion of "And Quiet Flows the Don" and its magnificent lyrical pictures cannot but remind me of Gogol, the master of the Russian language.
    It can be pointed out that Gogol's "Taras Bulba" played a positive role in developing the form of the Soviet historical novel. A. Chapygin's "Razin Stepan," "Wanderers," V. Shishkov's "Yemelyan Pugachev," and A. Zlobin's "Stepan Razin" are all vividly written novels created at different stages of the development of Soviet literature. These works inherited many principles of Gogol's work style. This is easy to understand because, in the novels of Soviet writers, as in Gogol's works, the people are put first. It is precisely because of this that they widely used folk creations, explored the poetic sources of narrative poems, and carefully studied the language of the people.
    Many more examples can be cited to illustrate the remarkable influence of Gogol on the creations of Soviet writers. However, the issue is not the number of examples, but that the entire Soviet literature extensively utilized the achievements of Russian and world classical literature. Romashov, one of the famous Soviet dramatists, successfully and movingly portrayed the significance of Gogol for our times. He wrote: "His creative spirit, his magnificent artistic aura, and the storm of passion he wrote about, involuntarily inspire the noble sentiments of Soviet artists, make them more keenly aware of the glorious communist prospects, and clearly feel the specific outlines of communism in our reality and in the people who are heroically building the future, and actively fight against everything that hinders our progress." That which Gogol vaguely dreamed of realizing, that "magnificent posture of a man galloping across the entire Russian land, heard everywhere," is today the practical embodiment of the new character of the Soviet people, and it seems that Gogol is calling on us to artistically embody these new people's characters.

    果戈里和苏联文学
    ——纪念果戈里诞辰一百五十周年
    苏联教授  尼·斯捷潘诺夫
    伟大的俄国作家果戈里的名字和他的天才作品，是真正不朽的。果戈里把为祖国和人民服务，看作是自己的天职。以讽刺手法揭露剥削制度，嘲笑卑鄙的生活，同时又以不共戴天的愤怒火焰攻击那使人遭受压迫、凌辱的社会不平现象，以及对祖国和人民的伟大和美好的未来的信心，充实了果戈里的创作，使它富有蓬勃的生气。
    在1952年纪念果戈里逝世一百周年时，苏联文学的著名代表之一的列奥尼德·列昂诺夫，在莫斯科举行的果戈里纪念碑揭幕式上的讲话，是有道理的。他说：“看来，我们同尼古拉·果戈里的时代的距离，不是一个世纪，而是整整一大段地质时间。从打那个时代起，我们国家从人民生活方式直到民族性格的某些方面，一切都起了变化……但是，我们也和我们的祖父一样，对这位鼓舞人心的诗人感到无比的亲近……”
    果戈里对于其后的整个俄国文学史发展的影响，是巨大的。作为俄国古典现实主义的奠基人，他对于像屠格涅夫、列夫·托尔斯泰、奥斯特洛夫斯基、萨尔蒂柯夫·谢德林、车尔尼雪夫斯基、陀斯妥也夫斯基、契呵夫及其他好多作家，发生了有益的影响。果戈里的人道思想、他对当代卑鄙龌龊的社会制度所进行的无畏的反抗、他对人民的热爱和他对普通小人物的命运的同情，——这一切使俄国的、而且不仅是俄国的文学繁荣滋长。
    果戈里的艺术技巧和他的鲜明多采的文笔，具有格外重大的意义。苏联作家在继承祖国古典文学的优秀传统时，过去和现在一直学习果戈里的创作，学习他的精湛的艺术语言的技巧，以及他那深刻而精心地掌握人民语言的功夫。同时，他们在汲取这种传统时，又是按照自己的方式使它适用于新的生活条件，并且按照社会主义现实主义的方向发展了来自果戈里的那些原则。
    苏联文学继承了果戈里的基本遗训和他对人民及人类优秀品质的爱。
    在社会主义现实主义文学奠基者高尔基的创作中，可以看出果戈里传统的具体反映。高尔基对果戈里的天才给予了崇高的评价，并且不止一次地建议苏联作家向这位伟大的艺术语言大师学习。1930年，高尔基把果戈里列入那些世界闻名的讽刺作家的行列，这些人“对统治阶级丑行的揭露，是一丝不苟地真实和严厉……”。高尔基创作中的歌颂英雄事迹的题材，也同果戈里的传统相呼应。阿·卢那察尔斯基曾写道：“果戈里和高尔基一样，狂热地追求美。”高尔基早期的短篇小说，以其鲜明的浪漫主义的人物，使人不禁想到果戈里作品中的主人公。果戈里的艺术典型化原则，对于高尔基的创作的成熟，具有十分巨大的意义。
    果戈里的讽刺原则，特别是他的戏剧艺术对于苏联文学的另一位最著名的代表马雅可夫斯基，也有重大的影响。马雅可夫斯基作的“臭虫”和“澡堂”，在新的基础上发展了“钦差大臣”的喜剧手法——喜剧的离奇同讽刺的概括和典型化结合。苏联的喜剧，一般说来多应归功于果戈里。像罗马朔夫的“科里沃雷里斯克的末日”这样的剧本，以及其他好多苏联戏剧家的喜剧作品，都汲取了喜剧大师果戈里的卓越经验。
    在伊里夫和彼得罗夫的长篇小说“十二把椅子”和“金牛犊”，以及其他苏联作家的好些讽刺作品中，都能找到果戈里的讽刺传统。我认为，萧洛霍夫在“被开垦的处女地”中运用的那种尽情的幽默，也同果戈里的具有深刻人民性的幽默相接近。
    来自果戈里民间叙事诗“塔拉斯·布尔巴”中的另一个英雄主义传统，它对苏联文学的影响也表现得很清楚。试举苏联文学早期作品之一、绥拉菲摩维支所写歌颂国内战争的英雄史诗“铁流”为例来看。在这里，这部史诗的基础，贯穿着果戈里作品的精神，它提到第一位的不是个别人，而是人民群众的英雄行为。塑造人物形象的强劲有力、叙事语言的激动人心，也使人想到果戈里的作品。甚至那决定了“铁流”风格的诗一般的韵律，也是出自果戈里的那种手法。
    果戈里的创作经验，对于苏联散文作家萧洛霍夫也有不小的影响。“静静的顿河”的英雄主义激情，它那壮丽的抒情的画面，又不能不使我想到俄国语言的大师果戈里。
    可以指出果戈里的“塔拉斯·布尔巴”对于发展苏联长篇历史小说的形式的积极作用。阿·蔡普雷金的“拉辛·斯捷潘”、“游逛的人”，沃·舍什科夫的“耶美里扬·普格乔夫”，阿·兹洛宾的“斯捷潘·拉辛”，都是在苏联文学的不同发展阶段写成的、文笔生动多采的长篇小说。这些作品继承了果戈里作品风格的许多原则。这是容易理解的，因为在苏联作家的长篇小说里，正如在果戈里的作品里一样，摆在第一位的是人民。正是因为这样，它们广泛地运用了民间创作，探索叙事诗的诗歌的源泉，并精心地学习人民的语言。
    还可以举出很多例子来说明果戈里对苏联作家创作所起的这种卓越影响。但是，问题不在于例子的多寡，而是在于整个苏联文学广泛地利用俄国及世界古典文学的成果。著名的苏联戏剧家之一的罗马朔夫，成功而动人地刻划了果戈里对我们时代的意义。他写道：“他的创作精神、他那雄伟的艺术气魄，他写的那种激情的大风暴，不由地激发了苏联艺术家们的高尚情感，使他们更加锐敏地注视到光辉灿烂的共产主义远景，在我们的现实中，和在英勇地建设未来的现实的人们身上，清晰地感到共产主义的具体轮廓，并且积极地为反对阻碍我们前进的一切事物而进行斗争。”果戈里模模糊糊梦想实现的那种东西，那种“在整个俄罗斯土地上奔驰、到处充耳可闻的威风凛凛的人的雄伟姿态”，在我们今天就是苏维埃人新性格的实际体现，而且仿佛果戈里是在号召我们从艺术上体现这些新的人民的性格。
