    Who Took Butterfly's Life?
    Xun Hua
    After watching the Central Experimental Opera House's performance of the world-famous opera "Madame Butterfly," I can't help but ask: Who took Butterfly's life?

    The opera "Madame Butterfly" is an immortal work by the 19th-century Italian genius opera composer Puccini. It tells the story of a Japanese girl who is loyal to love but is abandoned by an American naval officer and commits suicide. The tragic fate of Butterfly, who represents the hundreds and thousands of oppressed and suffering Japanese women of the 19th century, has a more profound realistic significance today. Now, under the further trampling of American imperialism, more Japanese women are suffering even more tragic fates than Butterfly. The brilliant opera composer Puccini, with his deep sympathy for the protagonist, absorbed the beautiful melodies of Japanese folk songs and used a realistic approach to create the wonderful music of this exciting opera, making it a valuable treasure in the world's opera treasury.

    Before the curtain rises, there is no lengthy overture or prelude, only a brief musical introduction that conveys a distinctive Japanese flavor. When the curtain rises, what appears before the audience is the beautiful Nagasaki Bay and Butterfly's new home. Cherry blossoms cover the hillside, butterflies fly freely among the flowers, and a group of Japanese girls holding parasols and wearing colorful clothes, like countless small butterflies, sing cheerfully and softly, "Ah! Ah! What a beautiful ocean," "What a beautiful sky." Pinkerton, a U.S. Navy lieutenant stationed in Nagasaki, takes a fancy to one of the girls, Cho-Cho-San (Butterfly). His crazy desire drives him to pluck this flower. Cho-Cho-San thinks she has found happiness and does not hesitate to betray her relatives and the religion her ancestors believed in, entrusting her entire fate to him. On this quiet moonlit night, they sing a love duet together, expressing their love to the fullest. In this duet, the shadow of American colonialism and the root of Butterfly's fate are also buried. This American naval officer is a complete egoist. Soon after marrying Butterfly, he returns to the United States and marries an American girl. But the poor Butterfly still faithfully believes in his promise, waiting for the day the swallows build their nests to welcome her husband back. Waiting! Waiting. Leaning by the door every day, gazing at the ocean. Countless dawns and countless nights have passed, and Butterfly still stands by the door, motionless, listening to every sound coming from the bay. This section of music is very delicate and profound, depicting Butterfly's state of mind as she waits day and night. Sad wrinkles appear on her face, and her eyes are filled with melancholy. One morning, the sailors' shouts are heard. She excitedly hurries to put on her wedding dress, and the house is filled with tempting flowers, but when this American naval officer finally arrives at his "home," he is accompanied by his American wife. They have come to take away the child Butterfly has given birth to. This is the result of Butterfly's three years of waiting! Love has disappeared, joy has been shattered, and Butterfly's heart is in despair. In great excitement, she recites the inscription "It is better to die with honor than live in dishonor" and raises the dagger in both hands to end her young life. At this time, the mournful symphony vibrates in the hearts of the audience and cannot be calmed for a long, long time.

    This is an unforgettable tragedy. It profoundly reveals the decadent American civilization and social morality advocated by colonialists represented by the American naval officer. Although the story depicted in this play takes place in Japan during the Meiji Restoration, are there not more American warships on Japanese territory today, carrying more Pinkertons there to continue ravaging kind Japanese women?

    The performance of the opera "Madame Butterfly" will prompt us to better understand the suffering of the Japanese people.

    The fact that this opera, which was produced in the 19th century, can be preserved as a repertoire in theaters around the world proves its immortal value. However, due to the limitations of the author's worldview, shortcomings reflected in the work are inevitable. This time, the performers of the opera house made some partial deletions and new artistic treatments to the original work, which I think is necessary. For example: the passage in the second act where Pinkerton confesses to Butterfly was deleted; the role of the American consul in the play was reinterpreted; and the theme's expression broke through the narrow circle of personal love, emphasizing the social significance of the tragedy, making the ideological viewpoint of this play clearer.

    The translators of this performance, Comrades Ge Baoquan and Zheng Xingli, made the poetry and accompaniment of the songs smooth, which deepened the audience's memory. The unified and coordinated stage atmosphere created jointly by the director, conductor, actors, musicians, and art designers made the entire performance feel clear and simple. The oriental tone of the entire play created by the director, and the soft but powerful singing of the actors, left a good impression on the audience.

    谁夺去了蝴蝶夫人的生命？
    迅化
    看了中央实验歌剧院演出的世界著名歌剧“蝴蝶夫人”，使我不禁要问：是谁夺去了蝴蝶夫人的生命？
    歌剧“蝴蝶夫人”是十九世纪意大利天才的歌剧作家普契尼的不朽作品。写的是一个忠于爱情的日本姑娘，被一个美国海军上尉遗弃而自杀的故事。蝴蝶夫人所代表的十九世纪千百个受压迫受苦难的日本妇女的悲惨命运，今天看来有着更深刻的现实意义。如今，在美帝国主义者更进一步的践踏下，更多的日本妇女遭受到甚至比蝴蝶夫人还要悲惨的命运。天才的歌剧作家普契尼，以他对剧中主人公的深切同情，吸取了日本民歌的优美音调，用写实主义的手法，创造了这部激动人心的歌剧的美妙音乐，使它成为世界歌剧宝库中的珍贵财富。
    幕开之前，没有悠长的序曲和前奏曲，只在一个简短的音乐引子中，传出富有特征的日本风味来。幕开了，出现在观众眼前的是美丽的长崎海湾和蝴蝶夫人的新居。樱花开遍了山坡，蝴蝶在花丛中自由飞翔，手持洋伞，身着各色衣服的一群日本姑娘，像无数只小蝴蝶，发出愉快而又柔和的歌唱“啊！啊！多么美丽的海洋”、“多么美丽的天空”。驻在长崎的美国军舰上的海军上尉平克尔顿看中了姑娘中的巧巧桑（即蝴蝶）。他疯狂般的欲望使他要摘下这朵鲜花。巧巧桑以为自己寻找到了幸福，不惜背叛了自己的亲人和祖先信奉的宗教，把全部命运交给了他。在这个安静的月夜，他们同唱着一支爱情二重唱，尽情地抒发自己的爱情。在这段二重唱里，也埋藏着美国殖民者的阴影和蝴蝶夫人命运的祸根。这个美国海军上尉是一个十足的利己主义者，他和蝴蝶结婚不久，就回到美国，又同一个美国女郎结了婚。而可怜的蝴蝶夫人，还忠实地相信着他的诺言，等待燕子筑巢的那一天迎接丈夫归来。等待啊！等待。每天倚在门旁，了望着海洋。无数个黎明，无数个深夜过去了，蝴蝶夫人还是站立在门旁一动也不动地倾听着海湾里传来的每一种声音。这一段的音乐十分细腻而深沉，描绘了蝴蝶夫人朝夕等待的心境。她的脸上挂起了悲哀的皱纹，她的眼里充满了忧郁。在一个清晨，果然传来了水手的吆喝声。她兴奋地急忙穿起结婚的衣服，房子里撒满了诱人的鲜花，但是当这位美国海军上尉终于来到他这个“家”的时候，伴随在他身旁的是他的美国夫人。他们是为了带走蝴蝶夫人所生育的孩子才来的。这就是蝴蝶夫人三年来等待的结果！爱情消失了，欢乐破灭了，蝴蝶夫人的心绝望了。在万分激动中她念着：“不能屈辱地生活”的铭言，双手举起匕手结束了自己年青的生命。这时，悲怆的交响乐，在观众的心灵里振荡，很久很久不能平静。
    这是一部令人难忘的悲剧。它深刻地揭示出以美国海军上尉为代表的殖民主义者，所宣扬的腐朽的美国文明和社会道德。这个戏所描写的故事虽然发生在日本明治维新时期，难道如今在日本的领土上，不是有着更多的美国军舰，载着更多的平克尔顿在那里继续蹂躏着善良的日本妇女吗？
    歌剧“蝴蝶夫人”的演出将促使我们更加了解日本人民所受的苦难。
    这部产生于十九世纪的歌剧，能在世界各国剧院里作为保留剧目保存下来，证明了它的不朽价值。但是，由于作者世界观的局限，反映在作品中的缺点是必然的。这次，歌剧院的演出者对原作进行某些局部的删改，和艺术上的新的处理手法，我认为是必要的。例如：删去了第二幕中平克尔顿向蝴蝶夫人忏悔的一段；又如重新解释了美国领事在剧中的作用；以及对于主题的表现，突破个人爱情的狭隘圈子，强调处理了悲剧的社会意义等，使这个戏在思想观点上更加明朗起来。
    这次演出的译者，戈宝权和郑兴丽同志使诗句和配歌的通畅，加深了观众的记忆。导演、指挥、演员、演奏员、美术设计等共同创造出来的统一协调的舞台气氛，使整个演出给人清晰朴实之感。导演所创造的全剧的东方色调，和演员柔和而有力的歌声，更是给观众留下了良好的印象。
