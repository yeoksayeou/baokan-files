    "Supplementary Weather Forecast" Accurate and Timely
    The Method Created by the Zhenxiong Climate Station in Yunnan Province is Promoted Nationwide; Prediction Accuracy Greatly Improved, Greatly Contributing to the Development of Production

    (Our reporter Ye Zijian reports) The new method of supplementary weather forecasting created and promoted by the Zhenxiong Climate Station in Yunnan Province has, since its promotion nationwide, increased the accuracy of weather forecasts across the country by 10% compared to 1957.

    In June 1957, the Zhenxiong Climate Station in Yunnan Province listened to the weather forecast and regional forecasts for a wide range of weather situations from the meteorological observatories of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces via radio. They carefully observed the changes in meteorological elements, topography, and geographical conditions of Zhenxiong County, and collected the weather-watching experiences and weather proverbs of farmers of all ethnic groups. By combining the three and conducting one hundred and thirty experiments, they correctly made supplementary forecasts. This method organically combined the large-scale weather situation with the special laws of local weather evolution, and the accuracy was very high. From 1957 to the present, the average monthly accuracy rate of the Zhenxiong Climate Station has been above 90%. After being promoted in Yunnan Province, the average monthly accuracy rate of about half of the meteorological (observation) stations has reached over 90%. In July 1958, the Central Meteorological Bureau decided to carry out supplementary forecasting nationwide at the Third National Meteorological Conference held in Guilin. Within a short period of six months, supplementary forecasting was generally established in various places, and 70% of the more than 2,800 meteorological (observation) stations across the country had carried out this work. This increased the accuracy of national weather forecasts in 1958 by 10% compared to 1957, while the average annual increase during the First Five-Year Plan was only 0.4%. Such a rapid increase in the accuracy of weather forecasts has never occurred before in the history of weather forecasting in our country.

    The accurate and timely supplementary weather forecasts have played a great role in agricultural and animal husbandry production. Last year, Yunnan Province experienced a major drought unseen in decades, and the meteorological departments promptly forecast this situation. Millions of people of all ethnic groups across the province rose up to fight the drought and won a bumper harvest. The Zhenxiong County Climate Station made accurate forecasts during several major weather changes, providing irrigation water for more than 80,000 mu of land, salvaging more than 700 million jin of grain, and ensuring that more than 300,000 livestock in the county were protected from freezing damage.

    In the past, weather forecasting was only done by technicians using weather maps, and there were only more than 10,000 people directly engaged in this work nationwide. After the development of supplementary weather forecasting, people's communes across the country generally established meteorological (observation) stations, outposts, and groups. Yunnan Province alone established 15 meteorological observatories, more than 200 meteorological (observation) stations, more than 1,500 meteorological outposts, and more than 24,000 weather-watching groups, basically forming a situation of "observatories in every prefecture, stations in every county, outposts in every commune, and groups in every team." Now, the number of people engaged in meteorological work nationwide has increased to more than 2.43 million, most of whom are farmers who have rich knowledge of weather science and do not leave their production posts.

    Supplementary weather forecasting fully utilizes the characteristics of animals, plants, and non-biological things in reflecting climate, as well as the light and sound phenomena of weather, providing richer bases and sources for weather forecasting scientific research. For example, before a long period of clear weather ends and rain is imminent, many experienced farmers can judge from phenomena such as fish tumbling towards the surface of the water, ants building levees at the entrances of their nests, the croaking of snakes and toads, and how bees and flies fly.

    Previously, weather forecasts made by meteorological observatories across the country were based on weather maps. This method could only forecast large-scale weather situations and could not solve the problem of weather forecasts for specific locations. Supplementary weather forecasting can solve this deficiency and provide timely service to production.

    Recently, the Yunnan Provincial Meteorological Department held a professional conference in Kunming, with more than 250 representatives from the Central Meteorological Bureau and provinces and cities across the country attending. In accordance with the policy of "relying on the whole Party and the whole people to run meteorology, improve service quality, focus on agricultural service, and form a national meteorological service network," the meeting carefully discussed how to further develop supplementary weather forecasting and better serve production.

    “补充天气预报”准确及时
    云南省镇雄气候站创造的方法在全国推广  预报准确率大大提高对发展生产作用很大
    本报讯　记者叶子健报道：云南省镇雄气候站创造和推广的补充天气预报的新方法，自从在全国范围内推广以后，去年全国气象预报的准确率较1957年提高了10％。
    1957年6月，云南省镇雄气候站从收音机中收听云南、四川、贵州三省气象台关于大范围的天气形势预报和区域预报，仔细观察镇雄县气象要素的变化、地形地理情况和影响，收集各族农民的看天经验和天气谚语。把三者结合起来进行了一百三十次试验，首先正确地做出了补充预报。这种方法有机地结合了大范围的天气形势和地方性天气演变的特殊规律，准确性很高。镇雄气候站从1957年到现在，平均每月的准确率在90％以上。在云南省推广后，平均每个月也有一半左右的气象（候）站的预报，准确率达到了90％以上。1958年7月，中央气象局在桂林召开的第三次全国气象会议上，决定在全国开展补充预报。在短短半年的时间内，补充预报就在各地普遍建立起来，全国二千八百多个气象（候）站有70％已经开展了这一工作。使1958年全国天气预报的准确率比1957年提高了10％，而第一个五年计划期间平均每年只提高了0.4％。像这样迅速地提高天气预报的准确率，在我国天气预报的历史上从来都没有过。
    补充天气预报准确及时，在农牧业生产上起了很大作用。去年云南省发生了几十年未有的大旱象，气象部门及时地预报了这种情况，全省几百万各族人民奋起抗旱，赢得了丰收。镇雄县气候站在几次天气大变化时进行了准确的预报，就提供了八万多亩田的灌溉用水，抢收了七亿多斤粮食，保证了全县三十多万头牲畜免受冻害。
    过去，天气预报工作，只是由技术人员用天气图的办法来做，直接从事这个工作的全国只有一万多人。开展补充天气预报以后，全国的人民公社普遍建立气象（候）站、哨、组。仅云南省就建立了十五个气象台，二百多个气象（候）站，一千五百多个气象哨，二万四千多个看天小组，基本上形成了“专州有台、县县有站、公社有哨、队队有组”的局面。现在全国从事气象工作的已增至二百四十三万多人，其中绝大多数是不脱产的具有丰富天气科学知识的农民。
    补充天气预报充分地运用了动物、植物、非生物对气候反映的特征和天气的光、声现象，为天气预报科学研究提供了更为丰富的根据和泉源。如久晴欲雨，许多老农能从水里的鱼向水面翻腾，蚂蚁在洞口修筑围堰、蛇和蛤蟆的鼓噪声、蜜蜂、苍蝇如何飞等现象来判断。
    以前，全国的气象台做天气预报都用的是天气图的办法，这种办法只能预报大范围的天气形势，解决不了具体地方的天气预报问题。而补充天气预报就能解决这个不足，能及时地为生产服务。
    最近，云南省气象部门在昆明召开了专业会议，中央气象局和全国各省市共派出了二百五十多名代表前来参加。会议根据“依靠全党全民办气象、提高服务质量、以农业服务为重点，组成全国气象服务网”的方针，仔细地讨论了如何进一步开展补充天气预报，更好地为生产服务的问题。
