Xinhua News Agency, London, March 7th: The British Communist Party has called on the British labor movement to awaken the people nationwide to stop the Conservative Party from implementing its policy of suppression and massacre in Africa.

Today's "Daily Worker" published a statement issued by the Political Committee of the British Communist Party, which called on the British people to support the African people's struggle against rule by a minority of Europeans, to support the African people's demands for the right to vote, and to oppose forcing them to join the Federation.

The statement said that the British Conservatives are responsible for the shameful attack on the people of Nyasaland, and the Conservatives support European minority rule in Africa at the expense of Africans.

The statement pointed out that in Nyasaland, the ratio of Africans to Europeans is four hundred to one, but in the Legislative Council, the ratio of Europeans to Africans is eighteen to five. For eighteen months, the Conservative government has been delaying holding talks it promised to hold to change this situation. It hopes to eliminate the African National Congress and lock Nyasaland more firmly into the Federation controlled by white settlers in Rhodesia.

The statement said that there is no evidence to prove the lie of the so-called African "plan to massacre" Europeans is true.

The statement said: "The Conservative Party's policies have caused disasters in Malaya, Kenya, Cyprus, the Suez Canal, and Jordan, and now they have come to Nyasaland. This policy brings poverty and death to Africans and harms the safety and living standards of the British people.

"The Africans in Nyasaland are making natural demands for the right to vote, the right to live, and the right to manage their own affairs. They are fighting to end the rule of a minority of Europeans over them. They oppose being forced to participate in a federal system completely dominated by white immigrants."

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 6th: The Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, in a statement to the press, condemned the British government's actions in killing African nationalists in Nyasaland, and pointed out that this is a "most improper, arbitrary, undemocratic and brutal" action.

The statement said: "The All-African People's Conference urges the world to pay attention to the historically mature and rising national and political consciousness, which is now very naturally spreading throughout the African continent."

The statement pointed out that "The All-African People's Conference believes that foreign oppression is often the cause of armed conflict." The statement said that the All-African People's Conference "emphasizes that it is necessary to resolve this painful tension, and sometimes even violent demonstrations, but there is no other way to eliminate the root causes of this legitimate resistance action other than granting Africans the right to self-determination."

The statement continued, the All-African People's Conference called on all African political parties, organizations, and churches to condemn the British government's action of massacring thirty Africans and arresting and exiling Dr. Banda, leader of the nationalist movement, and other African nationalist leaders.

The statement said that the All-African People's Conference emphasized that unless there is a government produced through free and secret ballot elections that allows the people to freely express their will, such autocratic and primitive British colonial governments like those in Rhodesia and Nyasaland will inevitably cause popular uprisings and be overthrown.

The statement concluded that the All-African People's Conference "fully supports the demands of all Africans to establish a government of their own choice through the only means—free and secret ballot elections."

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Blantyre dispatch: The just struggle of the African people of Nyasaland against British colonial rule has penetrated into remote areas. In order to cover up its brutal suppression of Africans, the colonial authorities have stopped releasing all news about military operations since the 6th.

According to news revealed by Western news agencies, the struggle is particularly fierce in remote areas of the Central Province of Nyasaland. In Mponela, armed police of the colonial authorities attacked a group of 600 Africans armed with spears, axes, and other objects on the evening of the 6th, killing one African and wounding three. There was fighting there all night.

Reports say that in many villages in the Visanza area, Africans have left their homes and entered the jungle to resist the bloody massacres of the colonialists.

    英共号召人民制止政府在非洲屠杀
    全非人民大会谴责英国当局在尼亚萨兰暴行
    新华社伦敦7日电　英国共产党号召英国的劳工运动唤起全国人民来制止保守党在非洲执行镇压和屠杀的政策。
    今天的“工人日报”刊载了英国共产党政治委员会发表的一项声明，这项声明号召英国人民支持非洲人民反对由少数欧洲人进行统治的斗争，支持非洲人民争取选举权的要求和反对强迫他们参加联邦。
    声明说，英国保守党人要对可耻地攻击尼亚萨兰人民负责，保守党支持由少数欧洲人统治非洲而牺牲非洲人。
    声明指出：在尼亚萨兰，非洲人同欧洲人的比例是四百比一，但是，在立法议会中，欧洲人同非洲人的比例是十八比五。十八个月以来，保守党政府一直拖延不举行它答应举行的会谈来改变这种情况。它希望消灭非洲人国民大会并且把尼亚萨兰更牢固地锁在由罗得西亚的白种移民者控制着的联邦系统中。
    声明说，没有丝毫证据足以证明所谓非洲人“计划屠杀”欧洲人的谎言是真实的。
    声明说：“保守党的政策在马来亚、怯尼亚、塞浦路斯、苏伊士运河和约旦造成了灾难，而现在又临到尼亚萨兰了。这种政策给非洲人带来贫困和死亡，并且损害了英国人民的安全和生活水平。
      “尼亚萨兰的非洲人正在提出对选举权、生活权以及管理自己事务的权利的自然要求。他们正在进行斗争以结束少数欧洲人对他们的统治。他们反对被迫参加完全受白种移民统治的联邦体系。”
    新华社阿克拉6日电　全非人民大会常设秘书处在向报界发表的声明中谴责英国政府杀害尼亚萨兰的非洲民族主义者的行动，并且指出，这是一种“最不正当、最专横、最不民主和最残暴的”行动。
    声明说：“全非人民大会促请全世界注意在历史上已经成熟的、不断高涨的民族觉悟和政治觉悟，这种觉悟今天正十分自然地遍及整个非洲大陆。”
    声明指出，“全非人民大会认为，外国的压迫经常是发生武装冲突的原因”。声明说，全非人民大会“强调指出，必须解决这种痛苦的紧张关系、有时候甚至是暴力示威，然而要消除产生这种合法反抗行动的根源，没有别的办法，只有给予非洲人自决权”。
    声明接着说，全非人民大会号召非洲各个人民政党、组织和教会谴责英国政府屠杀三十位非洲人并且逮捕和放逐民族主义运动领袖班达博士以及其他非洲民族主义者领袖的行动。
    声明说，全非人民大会强调，除非有一个通过自由和不记名投票的大选，让人民自由表达意志而产生出来的政府，否则，像罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰这种专制和原始的英国殖民地政府必然会引起人民的起义并且把它推翻。
    声明最后说，全非人民大会“完全支持全体非洲人希望通过唯一的办法——自由和不记名投票的大选——成立他们自己选择的政府的要求”。
    新华社7日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰非洲人反抗英国殖民统治的正义斗争已经深入边远地区。殖民当局为了掩盖它对非洲人进行的残酷镇压行动，从6日起已停止发布一切有关军事行动的消息。
    据西方通讯社透露出来的消息说，在尼亚萨兰中央省偏远地带，目前斗争特别剧烈。在姆波内拉，殖民当局的武装警察6日晚曾向一支由6百名手执长矛、斧头等物的非洲人组成的队伍进行攻击，打死了一名非洲人，击伤三人。在那里，整夜有斗争。
    有消息说，在维桑萨地区的许多村落，非洲人为了抵御殖民者的血腥屠杀，已经离家进入丛林。
