Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd. The Institute of National Music has made great achievements in collecting, sorting out, and researching China's national music.

    In the five years since its establishment, the institute has collected more than 1,500 ancient and modern national musical instruments. They have also collected hundreds of precious ancient musical scores, either woodcut or handwritten, scattered among the people. Some representative works have been translated into modern musical notation, including more than 70 pieces of Guqin music that were almost lost. From these scores, they have explored more than 30 kinds of ancient notation methods. In addition, they have collected more than 20,000 folk songs with melodies; collected many rare, and even unique, books, charts, and pictures related to music; and published more than 100 kinds of national music research materials, including monographs, collections of essays, textbooks, investigation reports, musical scores, and pictures. These not only provide valuable materials for compiling a relatively complete history of Chinese music, but also create conditions for musicians to inherit the excellent traditions of their motherland's national music and draw nourishment from folk music to develop modern music creation.

    The staff of this institute often carry tape recorders and cameras, going deep into remote mountains, ancient temples, rural fields, and minority areas to unearth China's rich treasures of national music. In the past five years, they have conducted more than 30 music investigations and interviews, and conducted comprehensive and detailed music investigations in many minority areas. Many precious ancient melodies, musical instruments, and beautiful folk songs have been obtained through these extensive and in-depth investigations and interviews; many musical scores and notation methods that were thought to have been lost for a long time have also been rediscovered in this way. For example, near Xi'an, they discovered a musical score used by an ancient large-scale drum band that is still preserved today, which is almost identical to the musical score used by the 12th-century lyricist Jiang Baishi; in the temples of Mount Wutai in Shanxi, they discovered that the musical score used by the orchestra there is the same as the notation method recorded by Zhang Yan in the 11th century. These discoveries have helped music historians smoothly solve certain translation problems of ancient musical scores, allowing the famous 6th-century Guqin piece "Youlan", the famous 7th-century piece "Guangling San", the lyrics and music of the 12th-century lyricist Jiang Baishi, and many other ancient instrumental pieces and operas to restore their artistic charm.

    Last year, the institute also conducted a key investigation into modern folk music life and published "Album of Great Leap Forward Folk Songs" with musical scores.

    发掘丰富的民族音乐宝藏
    民族音乐研究所深入调查搜集取得很大成绩
    新华社23日讯　民族音乐研究所在搜集、整理、研究我国民族音乐方面已取得很大成绩。
    这个研究所在成立以来的五年中，搜集到的古代、近代的各种民族乐器有一千五百件之多。他们还搜集了数百部流散在民间的木刻或手抄的珍贵的古代乐谱，其中一些有代表性的作品已经译成现代乐谱，包括几乎失传的古琴曲七十多首。从这些乐谱中，他们已摸索到三十多种古人记谱的方法。此外，他们还收集了有曲调的民歌两万多首；搜集了许多罕见的、甚至是孤本的有关音乐的书刊、图谱、画片；出版了包括专著、论文集、教本、调查报告、乐谱、图片等民族音乐研究资料一百多种。这些，不仅为编写一部比较完整的中国音乐史提供了珍贵的资料，而且为音乐家们继承祖国民族音乐的优秀传统、从民间音乐中吸取养料以发展现代音乐创作，创造了条件。
    这个研究所的工作人员经常背着录音机、摄影机，深入到深山古刹、农村原野以及少数民族地区，发掘我国丰富的民族音乐宝藏。五年中，他们共进行了三十多次音乐调查、采访活动，在许多少数民族地区作了全面的细致的音乐调查。许多珍贵的古代乐曲、乐器和优美的民间歌曲，就是通过这些广泛深入的调查采访而获得的；许多认为久已失传了的乐谱和记谱法，也是这样重新发掘出来的。如在西安附近，他们发现迄今尚保留着的一种古代大型鼓乐队所用的乐谱，跟十二世纪词人姜白石所用的乐谱几乎完全相同；在山西五台山寺院，他们发现那里乐队所用的乐谱，跟十一世纪张炎记载下来的一种记谱法相同。这些发现，帮助音乐史学家顺利地解决了某些古代乐谱的翻译问题，使六世纪的七弦琴名曲“幽兰”、七世纪名曲“广陵散”、十二世纪词人姜白石的词曲，以及其他许多古代器乐曲、戏曲等，都得以恢复它们的艺术魅力。
    去年，这个研究所还对现代民间音乐生活作了重点调查，出版了有曲谱的“大跃进民歌专辑”等。
