    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th – President Sukarno awarded President Ho Chi Minh the Indonesian “Guerrilla Medal” at a special ceremony held at the Independence Palace on the afternoon of the 7th, in recognition of President Ho Chi Minh’s contributions to the struggle for the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    President Sukarno said at the ceremony that President Ho Chi Minh was a great warrior and a great leader of the Vietnamese people. He said that President Ho Chi Minh launched guerrilla warfare to achieve independence for the Vietnamese people, just like the Indonesian people who also achieved their independence through guerrilla warfare.

    增进两国人民的友好联系
    苏加诺授勋章给胡志明
    据新华社雅加达7日电　苏加诺总统7日下午在独立宫举行的一个特别仪式上授予胡志明主席印度尼西亚“游击队勋章”，以表彰胡志明主席在争取越南民主共和国独立的斗争中的功绩。
    苏加诺总统在仪式上说，胡志明主席是一个伟大的战士和越南人民的伟大领袖。他说，胡志明主席发动游击战为越南人民取得了独立，就像印度尼西亚人民一样，他们也通过游击战的方式取得了自己的独立。
    苏加诺总统在指出两国革命运动的相似点后说，他把这枚“游击队勋章”授予胡志明主席作为两国人民友谊的象征。
    胡志明主席在致答词时说，这枚勋章是越南和印度尼西亚两国兄弟人民之间紧密团结的标志。越南和印度尼西亚人民是两个战友，他们已经在反对殖民主义和争取自由和独立的斗争中获得了胜利。
    他说，两国之所以取得胜利，是因为它们展开全国性的和全面的武装斗争，并且巧妙地应用了游击战术。
    胡志明主席在赞扬印度尼西亚人民在粉碎殖民主义者的侵略和保卫民族独立的英勇斗争后说，“我们将坚决反对帝国主义者和殖民主义者的任何战争计划以及目的在于侵犯我们的独立和我们的主权的任何阴谋。”
    出席这次仪式的有朱安达总理、外交部长苏班德里约、政府其它官员和军官等。
    胡志明主席今天下午还接受了五十九个印度尼西亚人民团体送给他的礼物。这些团体的一位代表说，礼物虽少，但是这些礼物表达了他们内心的感情。这些礼物将进一步加强两国反对殖民主义争取和平的斗争，特别是将加强它们在收复西伊里安和统一越南的斗争中的友谊。胡志明主席说，他将把他们的兄弟友谊传达给越南人民。他还希望印度尼西亚人民和越南人民在统一祖国和争取更幸福的生活的斗争中进一步加强团结。（附图片）
