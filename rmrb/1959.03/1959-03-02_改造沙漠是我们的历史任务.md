Transforming the Desert is Our Historical Task
Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

        The Concept of Desert
    Deserts, also known as dry seas or great deserts, are called Gobi or Elun in Mongolian, and Kum in Uyghur, generally referring to barren sandy lands. The names for deserts in ancient Chinese books are also inconsistent. The Buddhist Records of the Western World by Faxian of the Jin Dynasty called it the Sand River. One passage describes the desert near Dunhuang, noting: "In the Sand River, there are many evil ghosts and hot winds; those who encounter them die, and none are spared. There are no birds flying above, no beasts running below. Looking around, one cannot find a way to cross. Only dead human bones serve as markers." In the Records of the Western Regions of the Great Tang by Xuanzang, deserts are also called the Great Flowing Sands or Sand Dunes. In fact, deserts can be divided into stony, gravelly, and sandy types. Among sandy types, there are mobile and fixed varieties. Recently, it has become customary to call stony and gravelly deserts "Gobi," and only sandy ones are called "deserts." In biology, since both deserts and stony deserts are barren, they are collectively called arid lands, as a type of vegetation, to distinguish them from forests and grasslands. However, there are also arid lands in cold and high mountain areas where snow accumulates year-round. Strictly speaking, desert-type arid lands refer to barren lands in temperate and subtropical regions caused by drought or human activities. Generally, areas with an annual rainfall of less than 100 to 250 millimeters are called arid lands, and areas with 250 to 400 millimeters are called semi-arid lands. Soviet scientists Ivanov and Podiko and others use the aridity index, i.e., the ratio of annual evaporation to rainfall in a region, to determine the degree of drought and classify vegetation zones. In the areas south of the Yangtze River in China, the annual evaporation is generally less than the annual rainfall, i.e., the aridity index is below one, which is the forest zone. In North China and the western part of Northeast China, the aridity index is between one and 1.5, which is the forest-grassland zone. In the Baotou area of Inner Mongolia and the Yining area of Xinjiang, the aridity index is between 1.5 and 4.0, which is called grassland. If the aridity index reaches 4.0 or above, such as in the Hexi Corridor, the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, and the Tarim Basin, it is called arid land. Generally, people tend to think that arid land is infertile and cannot grow crops. However, if arid land can obtain adequate water sources and be artificially irrigated, it can achieve higher yields than ordinary land. The reason is that this type of soil has not suffered leaching losses during its development and is rich in fertility. In addition, arid areas generally have longer sunshine hours and ample sunlight. Therefore, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai and Hami and Turpan in Xinjiang are high-yield areas for wheat and cotton in China. The biggest disasters in deserts are wind and sand. The wind causes sand to accumulate into dunes, which can reach heights of several meters to tens of meters. They generally form crescent shapes. Once formed, they move with the wind, invading fields, submerging forests, burying railways, destroying houses, and even swallowing entire cities. Therefore, the formation and origin of sand in deserts is a scientific issue worthy of great attention. In the 1870s, there was a very popular theory that the present-day deserts were all seas in ancient times, and the sand was formed by waves hitting the shore rocks. This theory was particularly advocated by the German Richthofen. In the 1880s, the Russian V.A. Obruchev worked continuously for three summers in Central Asia, i.e., the Karakum (Black Desert) in the present-day Republic of Turkmenistan, from 1887 to 1890, proving that the formation of deserts in this region was mainly due to the constant changes and movements of rivers such as the Amu Darya. This view has since been confirmed by Soviet and other scientists in deserts such as Central Asia and the Sahara in Africa. However, deserts can be formed not only by the erosion and transportation of rivers, but also by lakes, oceans, and glaciers. Last year, during our survey in the northwest, we saw sand dunes stretching more than ten kilometers on the southeast bank of Qinghai Lake, west of Haiyan County. These sand dunes were formed by the waves of Qinghai Lake hitting the shore, turning the rocks into sand and gravel, which were then blown ashore by the northwest wind and gradually formed. They are still continuing to spread and grow. In addition, we saw numerous sand dune groups on the shore of Ebi Lake in Xinjiang. However, the sand in large deserts such as the Sahara and Tarim is mostly river-formed. Desertology is a newly emerging science that has gradually taken shape recently. Since the pioneering work of Academician Obruchev in the Soviet Union, scientific research on deserts has been continued by successors such as geographers and biologists such as Fodorovich and Petrov, and many specialized works have been published in recent years. The formation and development of deserts, the types of deserts, and the transformation of deserts have all been elaborated.
          The Distribution of Deserts
    Most of the world's deserts are distributed within the trade wind belts between 15° and 35° north and south latitude (the area between 30 degrees latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and the equatorial low pressure is frequently blown by the northeast wind, and the area between 30 degrees latitude in the Southern Hemisphere and the equatorial low pressure is frequently blown by the southeast wind is called the trade wind belt). From a meteorological point of view, this area is a high-pressure belt. The weather is relatively stable, rainfall is scarce, and the air is dry. Therefore, it is easy to create arid areas. The total land area of the world's continents is approximately 148 million square kilometers. About one-quarter of this is arid, with an average annual rainfall of between 100 and 250 millimeters. One-tenth is desert, with an average annual rainfall of less than 100 millimeters. The six largest deserts in the world are:
    1. The Sahara Desert in Africa, with an area of approximately 6.2 million square kilometers.
    2. The Great Australian Desert, with an area of approximately 2.8 million square kilometers.
    3. The Central Asian Desert, with an area of approximately 2.2 million square kilometers.
    4. The Arabian Desert, with an area of approximately 1.2 million square kilometers.
    5. The South American Desert, with an area of approximately 1 million square kilometers.
    6. The Southwestern American Desert, with an area of approximately 900,000 square kilometers.
    Among these, the desert belt extending from the Sahara Desert through the Arabian Desert to the Central Asian Desert is almost continuous. It accounts for 67% of the world's total desert area. The Central Asian Desert includes the deserts of Soviet Central Asia (accounting for 50% of the total area of the Central Asian Desert), the deserts of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia in China (accounting for 48%), and the deserts of the Mongolian People's Republic (accounting for 2%).
    The total area of China's land is approximately 9.6 million square kilometers. One-third of this is arid, and 11% is desert. Calculated in terms of mu (a Chinese unit of area, approximately 0.165 acres), the total area of deserts in China is approximately 1.6 billion mu, of which 98.4% is distributed in the six northwestern provinces and regions of China, namely:
    Xinjiang 820 million mu Qinghai 110 million mu
    Inner Mongolia 420 million mu Shaanxi 20 million mu
    Gansu 200 million mu Ningxia 15 million mu
    Capitalist Countries are Powerless to Deal with Deserts
    Since the dawn of history, mankind has been fighting against deserts. However, in feudal and capitalist societies, not only have deserts not been transformed into fertile land, but also places that should not have become deserts have been destroyed and turned into barren sandy lands due to human causes. Marx, in "The British Rule in India," described in detail: "From ancient times, there have generally been only three administrative departments in Asia: the Ministry of Finance, or the department that plunders its own people; the Ministry of War, or the department that plunders foreign people; and finally, the Ministry of Public Works. The climate and soil conditions, especially the vast desert zone stretching from the Sahara through Arabia, Persia, India, and Tartary to the highest regions of the Asian plateau, make irrigation using canals and water conservancy projects the basis of Oriental agriculture. ...This system of artificially increasing soil fertility depends on the central government, and it declines as soon as the government neglects irrigation and drainage projects; this explains a fact that would otherwise be inexplicable, namely, that we see today large areas barren and infertile, which were previously well cultivated, such as Palmyra, Petra, the ruins of Yemen, and some vast provinces of Egypt, Persia, and Hindustan. At the same time, this can also explain the fact that often a single devastating war can depopulate a country for hundreds of years and deprive it of all its civilization. Now, the British in East India have inherited the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of War from their predecessors, but they have completely neglected the Ministry of Public Works" (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 1, pp. 324-325). This describes the situation after the British rule in India before the mid-19th century, where the old irrigation system was completely abandoned, resulting in desertification. Marx also said: "If agriculture is allowed to develop on its own, the result will be that many originally fertile soils will become deserts." Excessive deforestation, overgrazing, destruction of grasslands, and blind reclamation can also cause desertification. For example, the Yulin area of northern Shaanxi has an annual rainfall of 250 to 450 millimeters and was originally a grassland area. However, since the destruction of forests for cultivation was approved by Baylor Songshan in the 56th year of Kangxi (1717 AD), the hidden sand has turned into open sand, completely destroying the fixed sand areas. During droughts, wind blows sand particles into dunes, turning the area sixty miles outside the Great Wall into a sandy wasteland. The sand dunes move with the wind every year, advancing from northwest to southeast, causing the Yulin city to be threatened by wind and sand, and the city site has been relocated three times in the 240 years from the early Qing Dynasty to the Liberation. Similarly, the Great Plains of the central United States have rainfall similar to that of northern Shaanxi, but because of deforestation and destruction of grasslands, a sandstorm disaster of yellow sand obscuring the sky and sun was brewed during the severe drought of 1930-1936. Millions of acres of fertile land in the states of Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas became sandy wasteland within a few years, and hundreds of thousands of people were homeless. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, at the beginning of the founding of the country, there were a total of 1.07 billion acres of forests in the country, but in recent years, only 100 million acres of usable forests remain, less than one-tenth of the original amount. From 1908 to 1938, the United States cut down 138 million acres of forests, while only 2.6 million acres were afforested, with the restored forest area being less than 2%. Therefore, the desert area in the United States is expanding daily. The same is true of the Sahara Desert in Africa. According to Aubréville, director of the Water and Forestry Bureau of the French Colonial Department, in his book "Climate, Forests, and Desertification," published in 1949, the tropical forest belt in Africa has retreated by 60 to 400 kilometers due to over-logging and burning. Areas that were once habitable have become deserts today. At present, capitalist countries do not take any measures to manage these deserts that harm mankind. Instead, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year using deserts as testing grounds for manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, such as hydrogen bombs, germ bombs, and toxic gases.
    Not long ago, I read in the newspaper that U.S. President Eisenhower boasted that the United States would help the Arabs improve their situation and develop the Sahara Desert. In fact, the United States still has many deserts in its own country that urgently need to be transformed, but they have not been transformed. This proves that the purpose of developing the Sahara Desert is not to transform the desert, but to plunder the oil and other resources of the Sahara Desert. We can recall that more than twenty years ago, a French geographer named Gautier suggested in his book "The Sahara Desert" that the waters of the Inchiri River be used to irrigate the Sahara Desert. However, in capitalist countries, the purpose of capitalist investment is to obtain the highest profit in a very short period of time, and transforming the desert is not profitable in the short term. Therefore, this plan still remains in that book. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization established a committee for arid zone research in 1951. It has only held a few meetings and published a dozen or so pamphlets in the past eight or nine years. However, no concrete practical work has been carried out. In 1951, a British science journalist named Richard Card traveled to the Sahara Desert. According to his report after returning home, to conquer the desert, one must first change people's habit of making profits. But without the capitalists' habit of making profits, there would be no capitalist society. The failure to manage the Sahara Desert is, of course, to be expected.
    Socialist Countries Will Turn Deserts into Oases
    Facts show that only in socialist countries can deserts be truly transformed. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union carried out large-scale sand fixation and afforestation work in the desert areas of Central Asia. In the Uzbek Republic alone, 340,000 hectares of sand were fixed and afforested from 1939 to 1957, turning many barren lands into lush oases. In addition, a canal traversing the Karakum Desert will be dug, with a total length of more than 1,100 kilometers. Among them, the 400-kilometer section from the Amu Darya to Mary has already been completed, which can irrigate 700,000 hectares of cotton fields and millions of mu of grasslands. Recently, the method of aerial seeding has been used to plant forests on a large scale in Central Asia. The achievements of the Soviet Union fully demonstrate that the face of the desert can be changed.
    Since the Liberation, the people in the desert areas of our country, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have launched large-scale mass sand fixation and afforestation work. Facts have also proved that mankind can not only subdue the harm of deserts, but also use deserts to benefit mankind. According to incomplete statistics, in the past eight years, Inner Mongolia and the northwestern provinces and Xinjiang and Ningxia regions have afforested a total of 21.14 million mu, planted grass on 26.36 million mu, diverted water to irrigate 950,000 mu of deserts, and used soil to cover 14.546 million mu of sand dunes, greatly improving the lives and production of the people in the sandy areas. Farmers in Gucheng Beach, Yulin County, Shaanxi Province, have turned more than 2,000 mu of sandy wasteland into rice paddies, with a yield of more than 400 jin per mu, reaching a maximum of 800 jin. The people of Yulin County are opening a Yudong Canal with a length of 280 li (a Chinese unit of distance, approximately 0.31 miles). Where the canal water reaches, trees and wild grasses naturally grow. In the past six months, reeds and cattails have grown more than three feet tall, and fish can be seen swimming in the lake, like a water town in southern China. To give another example, Anxi County in Gansu Province. The area is 1,160 meters above sea level, with an average annual rainfall of only 59 millimeters, and there is a lot of wind and sand. Since ancient times, it has been known as Shazhou (Sand Prefecture). In 1952, a sand prevention and control committee was established, proposing the slogan of fighting against wind and sand. In the past few years, methods such as planting trees and afforestation, building sand prevention dams, burying and covering sand dunes, sealing sand and cultivating grass, and using water to wash sand have been used to conquer nature, reducing the number of windy days from 196 days in 1953 to 129 days in 1956. The shifting sand has also been controlled. At the same time, natural conditions have been used to increase grain production year by year. In 1950, the average yield per mu was only 158 jin, and in 1958 it had reached 600 jin. The Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang are both large Gobi deserts, the places where, as described in Faxian's Buddhist Records of the Western World, there are no birds flying above and no beasts running below. However, since the Liberation, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has reclaimed 3.5 million mu of farmland from 1952 to 1958. Last September, we visited the Shihezi Farm in northern Xinjiang and the Akesu Shajingzi Farm in southern Xinjiang. These farms were all built on Gobi beaches four or five years ago, and now they have all become park cities with peach and plum trees in forests and crisscrossing fields. Last year, the Production and Construction Corps planted 980,000 mu of wheat with an average yield of 270 jin per mu, and 480,000 mu of cotton with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. These are all high-yield figures over large areas. The ancient Dutch had a saying that "God created the ocean, and man can turn the ocean into land." We can also say that "Nature creates deserts, and man can turn deserts into oases."
    In addition, a lot of work has been done in finding water sources and water conservancy construction. For example, in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, organized a water source survey team to go deep into the snow-capped mountains to survey the water source in the upper reaches of the Dang River, and found 700 million cubic meters of water in Yanchiwan Clear Water Gorge and other places, forming a grass lake of 800 square kilometers. In the past, all this water evaporated in vain. There are also 300 million cubic meters of water that can be diverted from Hala Lake in the upper reaches. If the 1 billion cubic meters of water from these two places are fully utilized for agricultural irrigation, even at the highest water consumption of 1,000 cubic meters per mu, it can irrigate as many as 1 million mu of farmland.
    At the planning conference on sand control held in Hohhot City last October for the six provinces and regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Ningxia, the general requirements for China's sand control plan were put forward: strive to transform and utilize deserts comprehensively and quickly, achieve comprehensive greening, turn deserts into animal husbandry and forestry bases, improve soil, and change the climate. The guidelines for sand control work are: put politics in command, the whole Party should take action, mobilize the whole people; comprehensive planning, comprehensive management; adapt to local conditions, take precautions against harm; combine universal management with key management; combine transforming deserts with utilizing deserts; combine biological measures with engineering measures; combine large-scale afforestation and grass planting with protecting and consolidating existing vegetation. The meeting decided to entrust the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant units to immediately organize a strong scientific team to assist various regions in carrying out sand control planning and help them implement it concretely, and to be responsible for solving major scientific and technological problems and theoretical problems in sand control work. Now this scientific team has been basically organized, and the Sand Control Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been established. Recently, the Sand Control Team held a planning meeting in Beijing, proposing three scientific tasks for this year: (1) complete a comprehensive survey of deserts across the country; (2) establish six fixed-point experimental stations in the northwest Inner Mongolia region in order to summarize experience and master the laws of desert development; (3) concentrate a certain amount of power to study wind energy, solar energy, and the application of new technologies in deserts. The team will soon be fully equipped and set off to the site to carry out its work.
    Transforming the desert is the historical task of the people of our new China. The superiority of the socialist social system and the corruption of the capitalist social system have been given another powerful proof in dealing with the problem of deserts.

    改造沙漠是我们的历史任务
    中国科学院副院长  竺可桢
        沙漠的概念
    沙漠又称旱海或大漠，蒙古语为戈壁，或额伦。维吾尔语为库姆，统指沙碛不毛之地。中国古书上沙漠的名称也不一致。晋代法显佛国记称为沙河。其中有一段描写敦煌附近的沙漠，记述如下：“沙河中多有恶鬼热风，遇则皆死，无一全者。上无飞鸟，下无走兽，遍望极目，欲求度处，则莫知所拟。惟以死人枯骨为标识耳。”在唐玄奘大唐西域记中又称沙漠为大流沙或称沙碛。其实沙漠有石质、砾质和沙质之分。而沙质中又有流动的与固定的分别。近来习惯称石质、砾质者为戈壁，而沙质者才称为沙漠。在生物学上因沙漠、石碛均为不毛之地，故概名为荒漠。作为植被类型之一种，以别于森林和草原。但在寒带和高山终年积雪之地亦有荒漠，严格说来，沙漠类型的荒漠，是指温带和副热带地区因干旱或人为原因所造成的不毛之地而言。普通以年雨量在一百至二百五十毫米以下的地区称为荒漠，二百五十至四百毫米的地区为半荒漠。苏联科学家伊万诺夫和菩地歌等更以干旱指数，即一地区年蒸发量与雨量之比，来定干旱程度，和划分植被地带。我国长江以南地区年蒸发量一般小于年雨量。即干旱指数在一以下，是为森林地带。在华北及东北的西部一带干旱指数为一至一点五，为森林草原地带。内蒙古的包头一带和新疆的伊宁一带干旱指数为一点五至四点零时则称草原。如干旱指数达到四点零以上，如河西走廊、新疆准噶尔盆地、塔里木盆地一带则称为荒漠。一般人往往以为荒漠既为不毛之地便一定不能生长农作物。其实荒漠如能得到适当的水源，并加以人工的灌溉，反而能得到比一般土地更高的产量。原因是这种土壤在发育过程中没有受到淋溶的损失，肥力充沛，再加上荒漠地区一般日照较长，阳光充足。所以青海的柴达木和新疆的哈密、吐鲁番是我国小麦和棉花的高产区。荒漠中最大的祸患是风和沙。因风的吹动使沙堆积成沙丘，高度可达数公尺到数十公尺。一般作新月形。形成以后，即顺风移动，可以侵入田园，淹没森林，埋葬铁路，毁坏房屋甚至吞掉整个城市。因此沙漠中沙的形成和来源是一个很值得重视的科学问题。在十九世纪七十年代，曾有过一个很流行的学说。认为现今的沙漠在古代均为大海，沙是由波浪打击岸边的岩石而形成的。此说尤以德国的李希妥芬为力。到十九世纪八十年代，俄国的维·阿·奥勃鲁契也夫自1887—1890年在中亚细亚，即现今土库曼共和国地区的喀拉库姆（黑沙漠）中连续工作了三个夏天，证明该地区沙漠的成因主要是河流如阿姆河等的不断变迁和移动。这种说法以后又为苏联科学家和别国的科学家在中亚及非洲撒哈拉等沙漠地区所证实。但沙漠不仅可由河流的剥蚀搬运作用而形成，并且亦可由湖泊、海洋以及冰川等原因而形成，去年我们在西北考察时，曾在青海湖的东南岸，海晏县的西面看到有蔓延十余公里的沙丘。这种沙丘即因青海湖的波浪击撞了湖岸，将岩石打成沙砾，再经西北风吹上岸而逐步形成。目前还在继续蔓延和成长中。此外在新疆的艾比湖畔，更看到众多的沙丘群。但是大沙漠如撒哈拉、塔里木等的沙则多半是河成的。沙漠学是最近才逐步形成的一门新兴科学。关于沙漠的科学研究工作，苏联自奥勃鲁契也夫老院士创始以来，经后起者如弗多罗维奇、彼得罗夫等地理学家和生物学家的继续钻研考察，已在近年出版了不少专门著作。对于沙漠的形成与发展，沙漠的种类，以及沙漠的改造等，均有所阐述。
          沙漠的分布
    世界上的沙漠大部分分布在南北纬15°—35°之间的信风带（北半球纬度三十度左右到赤道低气压之间经常吹东北风的地带，和南半球纬度三十度左右到赤道低气压之间经常吹东南风的地带称信风带）内。从气象学上讲，这一带是高气压带。天气比较稳定，雨量稀少，而空气干燥。所以容易造成荒漠区域。全世界大陆的总面积约一万四千八百万方公里。其中约四分之一是干旱地区，年平均雨量在一百至二百五十毫米之间。十分之一是沙漠，年平均雨量在一百毫米以下。世界上最大的沙漠有下面六个：
    1、非洲的撒哈拉大沙漠，面积约六百二十万方公里。
    2、澳洲大沙漠，面积约二百八十万方公里。
    3、中央亚细亚大沙漠，面积约二百二十万方公里。
    4、阿拉伯大沙漠，面积约一百二十万方公里。
    5、南美洲大沙漠，面积约一百万方公里。
    6、美国西南部大沙漠，面积约九十万方公里。
    其中从撒哈拉大沙漠经阿拉伯大沙漠直到中亚大沙漠差不多是一条相连的沙漠带。面积占全世界沙漠总面积的67％。中亚大沙漠包括苏联的中亚细亚的沙漠（占中亚大沙漠总面积的50％），我国的新疆、内蒙古等地的沙漠（占48％）及蒙古人民共和国的沙漠（占2％）。
    我国国土的总面积约九百六十万方公里。其中三分之一是干旱地区，11％是沙漠，如按亩为计算单位，我国沙漠的总面积约十六亿亩，其中98.4％分布在我国西北六省、区，计：
    新疆8.2亿亩青海1.1亿亩
    内蒙4.2亿亩陕西0.2亿亩
    甘肃2.0亿亩宁夏0.15亿亩
    资本主义国家对沙漠无能为力
    有史以来人类一直在同沙漠作斗争。但是在封建社会和资本主义社会里，不但没有把沙漠改变为良田，反而由于人为的原因把不应该成为沙漠的地方亦破坏成为沙荒了。马克思在“不列颠在印度的统治”一文中曾详细地叙述过：“从很古的时候起，亚洲通常只存在有三个行政管理部门：财政部，或掠夺本国人民部；军事部，或掠夺外国人民部；最后是公共工程部。气候和土壤条件，特别是从撒哈拉穿过阿拉伯、波斯、印度和鞑靼区直到亚洲高原最高地区的这一广袤的荒漠地带，使利用运河和水利工程进行的灌溉成了东方农业的基础。……这种用人工方法提高土壤肥沃程度的制度，是依靠于中央政府的，每当这政府对灌溉和排水工程表示疏忽时就立刻衰落下去；这就可以说明一件否则无法解释的事实，即我们今天看到有大片地区荒芜不毛，而这些地区先前都是耕种得很好的，例如帕尔密拉，彼特拉，也门废墟以及埃及、波斯和印度斯坦的一些广大省区就是这样。同时，这还可说明如下一件事实，即往往只要发生一次毁灭性的战争，就使一个国度在几百年内人烟绝迹，并使它失去它的全部文明。现在不列颠人在东印度从他们的先驱者那里承继了财政部和军事部，但他们却完全忽略了公共工程部”（马克思恩格斯文选，第一卷第324—325页）这是十九世纪中叶以前英国统治印度后使老的灌溉制度尽行废弃而造成荒漠的情形。马克思又曾经说过：“农业若是让他自流发展，结果会使许多原来肥沃的土壤变成沙漠。”滥伐森林，过度放牧，破坏草地，盲目开垦等亦会引起荒漠。如我国陕北榆林一带年雨量有二百五十到四百五十毫米，原为草原地带。但从康熙五十六年（公元1717年）起贝勒松善奏准毁林开垦以来，就使暗沙变为明沙，彻底毁坏了固定沙区。干旱的时候风吹沙粒积成沙丘，使长城以外六十里的地方全部变成沙荒。沙丘每年随风移动，从西北向东南推进，使榆林城自清初迄解放以前二百四十多年间因受风沙的威胁，已三迁城址。又如美国中部大平原雨量和陕北相仿，也因为砍伐森林，破坏草地，在1930—1936年大旱期间酿成黄沙蔽空，不见天日的风沙之灾。使甘萨斯、纳勃拉斯加、塔克赛斯诸州数百万良田在几年之内成为沙荒，数十万人民无家可归。据美国农业部统计，在开国之初，全国共有森林十亿零七千万英亩，而到近年，能用的森林只有一亿英亩，不及原来的十分之一。从1908—1938年间美国砍伐的森林达一亿三千八百万英亩，而植林只二百六十万英亩，恢复森林面积不足2％。所以美国沙漠面积正在日益扩展着。非洲撒哈拉沙漠亦是如此，据法国殖民部水利森林局局长奥部立维尔在1949年出版“气候森林与沙漠化”一书中说，非洲热带森林带因为滥伐与火烧已后退六十至四百公里之多。昔日可住人的地带今日已成沙漠。目前资本主义国家对这些为害人类的沙漠丝毫亦不设法治理。反而每年花费数亿美元把沙漠利用为制造大规模杀人武器，如氢弹、细菌弹毒气等的试验基地。
    不久前读报载美国总统艾森豪威尔扬言说：美国要帮助阿拉伯人改善境遇，开发撒哈拉大沙漠。其实美国至今在本国就有不少沙漠急待改造，而并未改造，这证明所谓开发撒哈拉大沙漠其目的并不在于改造沙漠，而在于掠夺撒哈拉大沙漠的石油和其他资源。我们可回忆一下，在二十多年以前，曾经有一个法国地理学家高蒂在“撒哈拉大沙漠”一书中，建议引那奇河水来灌溉撒哈拉沙漠。但在资本主义国家里资本家投资的目的是要在很短时间内取得最高利润，而改造沙漠是在很短期内无利可图的。因此，这个计划至今还停留在那本书上。联合国的教育、科学、文化组织，于1951年设立了一个干旱区域计划研究委员会。八、九年来只开过几次会，出了十几种小册子。但具体的实际工作却一无表现。1951年曾有一个名叫理查·卡得的英国科学记者去撒哈拉大沙漠旅行。据他回国后的报告说，要征服沙漠，首先要改变人的孳孳为利的习惯。但是没有资本家孳孳为利的习惯，也就没有资本主义的社会了。撒哈拉大沙漠之不能治理，当然在预料之中了。
    社会主义国家要沙漠变成绿洲
    事实表明，只有在社会主义国家里沙漠才可能得到真正的改造。十月革命后，苏联在中亚细亚沙漠地区进行了大规模的固沙造林工作。仅乌兹别克共和国，从1939到1957年就已固沙造林三十四万公顷，使许多不毛之地变成了青葱的绿洲。此外还将开凿横贯喀拉库姆沙漠的运河，全长达一千一百余公里。其中从阿姆河起到达马利计长四百公里，早已完工，可灌溉七十万公顷的棉田和数百万亩的草地。最近更在中亚施用飞机播种的办法大面积种植森林。苏联的成就充分说明了沙漠的面貌是可以改变的。
    我国自解放以后，沙漠区的人民就在党和政府的领导下，大规模地开展了群众性的固沙造林工作。事实也证明，人类不仅可以制服沙漠的危害，而且人类还可以利用沙漠为人类造福。据不完全统计，在过去八年中，内蒙及西北各省和新疆、宁夏地区共造林二千一百一十四万亩，种草二千六百三十六万亩，引水灌溉沙漠九十五万亩，用土来压沙丘一万四千五百四十六亩，使沙区人民的生活和生产得到很大的改善。陕西省榆林县古城滩的农民把二千多亩沙荒变成稻田，亩产四百多斤，最高达八百斤。榆林县人民正在开一条长二百八十里的榆东渠。渠水到处，树木、野草自然生长。半年以来芦草蒲草已长了三尺多高，湖里游鱼可数，景象像江南水乡一样。再举一个甘肃省安西县的例子。该地拔海一千一百六十公尺，年平均雨量仅五十九毫米，风沙很多，自古以来即有沙州之称。1952年成立了防治风沙委员会，提出同风沙战斗的口号。几年来用植树造林、打防沙坝、埋压沙丘、封沙育草和用水冲沙等办法，征服了自然，使大风天从1953年的全年一百九十六天减少到1956年的一百二十九天。流沙亦被制住了。同时还利用了自然条件，使粮食产量逐年提高。1950年平均亩产只一百五十八斤，1958年已达到六百斤。新疆的准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地统是大戈壁，晋法显佛国记中所说上无飞鸟下无走兽的地方。但解放以来新疆建设兵团从1952年起至1958年开辟农田三百五十万亩。去年9月我们曾至北疆的石河子农场和南疆的阿克苏沙井子农场参观。这些农场统是四五年前的戈壁滩上建立起来的，而现在统已变为桃李成林、阡陌纵横的公园城市了。建设兵团去年曾种小麦九十八万亩平均亩产二百七十斤，棉花四十八万亩平均亩产皮棉一百斤，这些都是大面积的高产数字。古代荷兰人曾有俗语说道“上帝造海洋，人能使海洋变大陆”。我们也可以说“自然造沙漠，人能使沙漠变绿洲”。
    此外，在寻找水源和水利建设方面，亦做了不少工作。如甘肃省敦煌县的人民，1958年在党的领导下组织了水源查勘队，深入雪山查勘党河上游的水源，发现盐池湾清水峡口等处有水七亿公方，形成一个八百方公里的草湖。过去这些水都白白蒸发掉了。其上游哈拉湖亦有三亿公方的水可引用。如把这二处共计十亿公方的水充分利用到农田灌溉上去，即以每亩一千方的最高用水量来计算，亦可灌溉农田一百万亩之多。
    去年10月在呼和浩特市举行的内蒙古、新疆、甘肃、青海、陕西、宁夏六省、区的治沙规划会议上，提出我国治沙规划的总要求是：争取尽快地全面地改造和利用沙漠，实现全面绿化，变沙漠为畜牧业和林业基地，改良土壤，改变气候。治沙工作的方针是：政治挂帅、全党动手、全民动员；全面规划、综合治理；因地制宜、因害设防；普遍治理与重点治理相结合；改造沙漠与利用沙漠相结合；生物措施与工程措施相结合；大量造林种草与保护巩固现有植被相结合。会议决定委托中国科学院与有关单位立即组织起一支强有力的科学队伍，以协助各地区进行治沙规划并帮助其具体实施，并负责解决治沙工作中的重大科学技术问题和理论问题。现在这一支科学队伍已基本上组织起来，中国科学院治沙队已经成立。最近治沙队在北京召开了一次计划会议，提出今年三项科学任务：（1）完成全国沙漠的综合考察；
  （2）在西北内蒙古地区建立六个定位试验站，以便总结经验，掌握沙漠发展的规律；（3）集中一定力量研究沙漠
  中的风能、太阳能和新技术的应用。该队不久即将整装出发，开赴现场进行工作。
    改造沙漠是我们新中国人民的历史任务。社会主义社会制度的优越性和资本主义社会制度的腐朽性，在处置沙漠的问题上又得到一个有力的证明。
