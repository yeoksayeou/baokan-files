    "Three Yangs Bring Prosperity"
    China is rich in phosphate rock resources. Dozens of phosphate rock bases with proven reserves have already been discovered, and the reserves are very large. Among these dozens of phosphate rock bases, the Kunyang Phosphate Mine in Yunnan Province, the Kaiyang Phosphate Mine in Guizhou Province, and the Jingxiang (formerly known as Xiangyang) Phosphate Mine in Hubei Province are the largest. These three large phosphate mines are about to be constructed. Once completed, they will produce huge quantities of phosphate rock annually. Therefore, people call it "Three Yangs Bring Prosperity."
    The Kunyang Phosphate Mine is located on the southwestern border of the motherland, on the shore of Kunming Lake in Yunnan Province, with convenient transportation. Most of the ore layers of this mine are exposed on the mountaintops, and the ore layers are stable and the scale is huge. The ore contains an average of about 26% phosphorus pentoxide, and the reserves are very large. Yunnan Province has already established a small, modern phosphate rock powder plant on the shore of Kunming Lake, and plans to gradually expand it into a chemical processing plant. The state also plans to build a modern, large-scale open-pit mine here.
    The Kaiyang Phosphate Mine is located in the undulating mountains of the Guizhou Plateau in central Guizhou Province. This mining area is large in scale, and the proven reserves are also very large. Moreover, a mining area of ​​similar scale and high grade has also been discovered in neighboring Wengan County as a backup base. Therefore, it is enough to establish a large mine for more than a hundred years of mining. The ore here contains a higher percentage of phosphorus pentoxide than any other mining area, with an average content of 34% to 36%, and a maximum of 40%. This high-grade phosphate rock does not require the construction of a beneficiation plant, which can save investment, equipment and materials, and greatly speed up the construction speed.
    The Jianghan Plain in western Hubei Province has historically been known as the "land of fish and rice," and it also has rich mineral resources underground. Phosphate rock is a huge treasure here. This mining area is located between Jingzhou and Xiangyang, so it is called "Jingxiang Phosphate Mine." According to preliminary survey results, the ore layer in this mining area is thick and extends for dozens of miles. The phosphorus pentoxide content of the ore averages between 11% and 30%, with the highest being over 30%. Such a rich phosphate rock base is located in the heart of Central China, and its active development is of great significance in the case of relatively few phosphate rock resources being discovered in the north.

    “三阳开泰”
    我国的磷矿资源丰富，现在已经探明储量的磷矿基地就有几十处，储量很大。在这几十个磷矿基地中，以云南省的昆阳磷矿、贵州省的开阳磷矿及湖北省的荆襄（过去称为襄阳）磷矿为最大，这三个大型磷矿即将建设，建成后，每年可以生产巨量磷矿石，因此人们称为“三阳开泰”。
    昆阳磷矿，在祖国西南边陲，云南省的昆明湖畔，交通很方便。这个矿的矿层，大都露在山头上，而且矿层平稳，规模巨大。矿石含五氧化二磷平均在26％左右，矿藏量很大。云南省已经在昆明湖畔建立了一个小型现代化的磷矿粉厂，并计划逐步扩大为化学加工厂，国家还计划在这里建设一个现代化大型露天矿。
    开阳磷矿，在我国西南高原山峦起伏的贵州省中部。这个矿区规模较大，现已探明的储量也很大，并且在邻近瓮安县，也发现了规模相似、品位较高的矿区，作为后备基地。因此，建立一个大型矿山足够开采百余年。这里的矿石含五氧化二磷比任何矿区都高，平均含量为34％到36％，最高达40％。这种高品位的磷矿，不需建设选矿厂，既可节约投资、设备和材料，并且可以大大加快建设速度。
    湖北省西部的江汉平川，历称为“鱼米之乡”，地下也蕴藏着丰富的矿物资源，磷矿就是这里一项巨大的宝藏。这个矿区因为在荆州和襄阳之间，所以叫做“荆襄磷矿”。这个矿区根据初步勘查结果，矿层厚度大，延伸几十里，矿石五氧化二磷含量平均在11％到30％，最高的在30％以上。这样丰富的磷矿基地正处于华中腹地，在北方磷矿资源发现比较少的情况下，积极开发有其重要意义。
