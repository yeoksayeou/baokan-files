Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 18th: The Iraqi Republic government delegation returned to Baghdad this afternoon after signing an economic and technical cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union.

The delegation received a very warm welcome from the Iraqi people upon returning to Baghdad. Thousands of people, holding aloft banners welcoming friendship with the Soviet Union and welcoming selfless Soviet aid, flooded the airport and surrounded the plane.

The head of the delegation, Minister of Economy Kubba, delivered a short speech on the steps outside the Soviet special plane that carried the delegation from Moscow. He said that the signing of the Iraqi-Soviet economic and technical cooperation agreement "provides a solid foundation for building our national economy and completing the social revolution."

Kubba's speech was frequently interrupted by cheers from the people. The minister concluded his speech by shouting, "Long live Arab-Soviet friendship!"

The crowds excitedly sang songs and returned from the airport to Baghdad city.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 18th: Baghdad newspapers unanimously and warmly welcomed the signing of the Soviet-Iraqi economic and technical cooperation agreement, considering it the most significant event and a new victory for Iraq since the victory of the revolution.

"Al-Shaab" (The People's Daily) said that the agreement was signed on the basis of mutual benefit and without any conditions. It will guarantee Iraq's establishment of several major technical and industrial projects and free Iraq from its past complete dependence on the West. The newspaper also stated that "this unconditional assistance from the Soviet side will help our country adopt a policy of industrialization."

The newspaper concluded by saying that strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between Iraq and the socialist countries has a significant impact on Iraq's determination of a foreign policy based on the principles of neutrality, international cooperation, and maintaining world peace.

"Al-Khabar" (News) welcomed the agreement, saying that the Iraqi people are grateful to the Soviet Union for its support for Iraq and other democratic countries seeking a better future.

"Al-Bilad" (The Country) said that this agreement is a major factor in consolidating the principles of Asian-African solidarity and peaceful coexistence adopted by the Bandung, Cairo, and Accra conferences. It said: "Imperialism is most afraid that our country will break free from its shackles."

The newspaper also stated that the Soviet Union helps our country in the same way it usually treats all small countries seeking true peace and freedom. The socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is a true friend of the Arab nation and all peace-loving countries.

"Ittihad al-Sha'ab" (People's Unity) praised the signing of the agreement, considering that the signing of this agreement with the Soviet Union is the most important measure taken by the Iraqi government since the success of the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 18th: Baghdad Radio commented on the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed between Iraq and the Soviet Union on the evening of the 17th, saying that this agreement is a new force for strengthening Iraq's national economy and guaranteeing the prosperity of the people, and therefore it will consolidate Iraq's political victories already achieved. The commentary emphasized that this agreement does not attach any political or economic conditions that involve Iraq's independence or are detrimental to its national sovereignty.

The commentary said, "The era when treacherous rulers often reached agreements that only benefited the imperialists and paved the way for imperialist exploitation and infiltration is gone forever."
