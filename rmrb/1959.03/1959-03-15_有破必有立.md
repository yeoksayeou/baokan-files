Reforming unreasonable rules and regulations to promote the development of productive forces is an important experience gained in the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward. In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers and staff established a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and greatly broke down unreasonable rules and regulations, which powerfully promoted the all-round Great Leap Forward in production and construction. In order to develop the socialist cause in a faster, better, more economical way, the broad masses of workers and staff should be encouraged to further carry forward this spirit and continue to reform unreasonable rules and regulations in the future. However, where there is destruction, there must be construction. After unreasonable rules and regulations are abolished, reasonable rules and regulations must be used to replace them. Construction must follow destruction, and resolute implementation must follow construction.

The rules and regulations in industrial and mining enterprises, no matter how many types there are, can be summarized into two categories. One category falls within the scope of administrative management, which reflects the relationship between people and the order of management within the enterprise, and serves production. The other category belongs to technical management, which reflects the objective laws of the production process. Both categories of rules and regulations originate from practice and are formulated based on the summary of experience in production struggles. When rules and regulations correctly reflect the relationship between people and the objective laws of the production process within the enterprise, they are conducive to giving play to the initiative and creativity of the masses. They not only do not bind productive forces, but also promote the development of productive forces. Such rules and regulations are reasonable rules and regulations. We must strictly abide by reasonable rules and regulations and must not violate them. Violation will inevitably cause chaos in production and even cause significant losses to the lives and property of the people. On December 6 last year, when a group leader at the Beijing Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power was baking motor coils, he violated safety technical regulations, causing the largest fire in Beijing since liberation, with losses amounting to approximately 700,000 yuan. This is a serious lesson that should arouse everyone's vigilance.

People's production struggles are constantly changing and developing. People's production skills are also constantly changing and developing. People's understanding of the objective laws of the development of things is also gradually changing from incomplete to relatively complete, and from low-level to relatively high-level. Due to these constantly changing situations, rules and regulations are often in a state of being able to correctly reflect objective practice and also being unable to completely correctly reflect objective practice. Some rules and regulations that are correct and reasonable at a certain time and under certain conditions may become incorrect, unreasonable, or not completely correct or not completely reasonable at another time or under other conditions. Things that were once conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses and able to promote the development of productive forces may become obstacles to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses and hindering the development of productive forces. For example, Changchun Station of the Jilin Railway Bureau used to have a system: one brakeman was assigned for every five loaded cars. When the technical level of the brakeman could only manage five loaded cars, this system was undoubtedly reasonable because it correctly reflected objective practice—the technical level of the workers. However, when the technical level of the brakeman has improved to the point where they can manage ten loaded cars, it cannot correctly reflect objective practice and therefore becomes unreasonable. If we do not modify it, this system will limit the enthusiasm of the workers and bind the development of productive forces. In January of this year, Changchun Station changed this system to: the number of loaded cars a brakeman watches is appropriately determined by the dispatcher based on the brakeman's technical level. Such a reform is not only conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the staff, but also conducive to saving labor and increasing the work efficiency of the brakeman by about one-fold. Therefore, no rules and regulations can be regarded as sacred and inviolable. We must constantly use the developed objective situation to test various rules and regulations. For the parts that are still reasonable, they should be retained; for the parts that are unreasonable, they should be modified or abolished. Through this kind of "metabolism," the management level of the enterprise is constantly improved with the development of production. Abolish what should be abolished, modify what should be modified, and retain what should be retained. This is a realistic and scientific attitude towards rules and regulations.

The abolition and modification of unreasonable rules and regulations does not mean that rules and regulations are not needed. What we want to eliminate is not the rules and regulations themselves, but the unreasonable parts of them. Modern industrial production is a very complex process. From the time raw materials enter the factory to the time products leave the factory, it requires the joint collaboration of many departments, workshops, groups, and workers. Everyone and every link must act in accordance with the objective laws of production in order to ensure the normal progress of production and the good results of production. Therefore, in industrial and mining enterprises, there must be a set of reasonable administrative management systems and technical management systems as the guidelines for the actions of all employees, to ensure that the enterprise's production proceeds in an orderly manner and to ensure the fulfillment of national plans in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. For example, recently, the Beijing Switch Factory, in the midst of a vigorous mass movement, formulated and implemented rules and regulations such as the inspection system for externally purchased collaborative parts entering the factory, the inspection system for products leaving the factory, and the technical standards for the use of substitute materials. As a result, it not only overfulfilled the output plan, but also improved the quality of the switches. Nanjing Station of the Nanjing Railway Bureau, while mobilizing the masses to tap transportation potential, established and improved a series of new management systems based on the needs of production, and a new situation of a double leap forward in transportation and safety has also emerged. There are many, many such examples.

Necessary rules and regulations are necessary to ensure the normal progress of production. Therefore, after breaking the unreasonable rules and regulations, new rules and regulations must be established to replace them. Destruction and construction are two different stages in the process of the development of things. From destruction to construction is the process of the unity of opposites between rules and regulations and the objective practice they reflect. The reason for destruction is that it cannot correctly reflect objective practice (contradiction with objective practice), and the reason for construction is to correctly reflect objective practice (unity with objective practice). From old rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces (contradiction) to new rules and regulations that promote the development of productive forces (unity), from destruction to construction is a leap. Constant destruction and construction are constant leaps. Destruction is the beginning of the leap, and construction is the landing point of the leap. Therefore, destruction is for construction. After breaking the old, the new must be established. Destruction is not our goal; construction is our goal. Only destruction without construction, only a beginning without an end, violates the objective laws of the development of things.

Saying that construction must follow destruction does not mean that for every old rule and regulation that is destroyed, a corresponding number of new rules and regulations must be established, with no increase or decrease whatsoever. It simply means that every task should have a set of rules and regulations, and when the old ones are broken, new ones should be established to replace them. As for how many types and numbers of new rules and regulations are needed, this should be based on actual needs. Increase what needs to be increased, and streamline and merge what needs to be streamlined and merged. Many of the old rules and regulations, especially the old rules and regulations in technical management, are unreasonable, but some parts of them are reasonable. In his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," Lenin said about the Taylor system of capitalism: the Taylor system, like all other advances of capitalism, "combines two things: the most subtle and cruel means of bourgeois exploitation and a

    有破必有立
    改革不合理的规章制度，促进生产力发展，是整风和大跃进的实践中一条重要经验。1958年广大职工群众在党的领导下，树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，大破不合理的规章制度，有力地推动了生产和建设的全面大跃进。为了多快好省地发展社会主义事业，今后还应当鼓励广大职工进一步发扬这种精神，继续改革不合理的规章制度。但是，有破必有立，不合理的规章制度废除了，一定要有合理的规章制度来代替它，破之后必须立，立之后必须坚决执行。
    工矿企业里的规章制度，不论有多少种，归纳起来不外两类。一类属于行政管理范围的，它反映企业内部人与人之间的关系和管理秩序，是为生产服务的。另一类属于技术管理，它反映生产过程的客观规律。这两类规章制度都来源于实践，都是人们根据生产斗争经验的总结而制定出来的。当规章制度正确反映企业内部人与人之间的关系和生产过程的客观规律的时候，它们就有利于发挥群众的积极性和创造性，不仅不束缚生产力，而且能够促进生产力的发展。这样的规章制度就是合理的规章制度。对于合理的规章制度，我们必须严格遵守，不能违反。违反了，就必然引起生产的混乱，甚至使人民的生命财产遭受重大的损失。去年12月6日，水利电力部北京修造厂一个组长烘烤电机线圈的时候，由于违反了安全技术规程，造成了北京解放以来最大的一次火灾，损失达七十万元左右。这是一次严重的教训，应当引起大家的警惕。
    人们的生产斗争的实践是不断变化、不断发展的。人们的生产技能也是不断变化和发展的。人们对事物发展的客观规律的认识，也逐步由不完全到比较完全、由低级到比较高级。由于这些方面的不断变化的情况，规章制度就常常处于又能正确反映客观实践，又不能完全正确反映客观实践的状态中。有些在一定时间和一定条件下是正确的、合理的规章制度，在另一个时间、另一种条件下，就可能变得不正确、不合理，或者不完全正确、不完全合理；曾经有利于发挥群众积极性、能够推动生产力发展的东西，可能变得妨碍群众积极性的发挥和妨碍生产力的发展。例如吉林铁路局长春车站，过去有这样一条制度：每五辆重车配备一名制动员。当制动员的技术水平只能管五辆重车的时候，这个制度无疑是合理的，因为它正确反映了客观实践——工人的技术水平。但是，当制动员的技术水平已经提高到能够管十辆重车的时候，它就不能正确反映客观实践，因而就变成不合理的了。如果我们不加以修改，这个制度就会限制工人的积极性，束缚生产力的发展。今年1月间长春车站将这个制度改为：一个制动员看多少辆重车，由调度员根据制动员的技术水平适当掌握。这样的改革，既有利于发挥工作人员的积极性，又有利于节约劳动力，使制动员的工作效率提高一倍左右。因此，决不能把任何规章制度看作是神圣不可侵犯的，必须不断地根据发展了的客观情况来检验各种规章制度，对于其中仍然合理的部分，要加以保留；对于其中不合理的部分，要加以修改或者废除。经过这种“新陈代谢”，使企业的管理水平随着生产的发展而不断提高。该废除的废除，该修改的修改，该保留的保留，这是对待规章制度的实事求是的科学态度。
    不合理的规章制度的废除和修改，绝不等于不要规章制度。我们所要破除的并不是规章制度本身，而是其中不合理的部分。现代工业的生产是个很复杂的过程，从原材料进厂到产品出厂，需要许多部门、车间、小组和工人的共同协作。每一个人、每一个环节都必须按照客观的生产规律办事，才能保证生产正常地进行，和生产的良好效果。所以，在工矿企业里，必须要有一套合理的行政管理制度和技术管理制度，作为全体职工行动的准绳，保证企业的生产有条不紊地进行，保证更多更快更好更省地完成国家计划。例如最近北京开关厂在大搞群众运动中，制定并执行了外购协作零件入厂检验制度、产品出厂检验制度、使用代用材料的技术标准等规章制度以后，不但超额完成了产量计划，而且提高了开关质量。南京铁路局南京车站，在发动群众挖掘运输潜力的同时，从生产需要出发，建立和健全了一系列新的管理制度，也出现了运输、安全双跃进的新局面。这样的例子是很多很多的。
    必要的规章制度是保证生产的正常进行所必需的，所以在破了那些不合理的规章制度以后，必须建立新的规章制度来代替。破和立，是事物发展过程中的两个不同阶段。从破到立，是规章制度和它所反映的客观实践的对立的统一的过程。所以要破，就是因为它不能正确反映客观实践（与客观实践矛盾），所以要立，就是要正确反映客观实践（与客观实践统一）。从旧的束缚生产力的发展（矛盾）的规章制度，到新的推动生产力的发展（统一）的规章制度，从破到立，是一个飞跃。不断地破和立，就是不断地飞跃。破是飞跃的开始，立是飞跃的落脚点。所以，破是为了立。破了旧的，必须立新的。破，不是我们的目的；立，才是我们的目的。只破不立，只有始没有终，这是违反事物发展的客观规律的。　
    说破之后必须立，当然不是说破了多少种、多少条旧规章制度，也必须立多少种、多少条新的规章制度，一丝不能增加，一丝不能减少，而只是说，每一项工作都应该有一个规章制度，旧的破了，应立新的来代替。至于新的规章制度要多少种多少条，这要从实际需要出发，需要增加的就增加，需要精简合并的就精简合并。旧的规章制度，特别是技术管理方面的旧规章制度，有很多是不合理的，但其中也有某些部分是合理的。列宁在“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一文中，讲到资本主义的太罗利制的时候，曾经说过：太罗利制也和资本主义其他一切进步一样，“包含着两种成分，一种是资产阶级剥削的最巧妙的残酷手段，另一种是许多最丰富的科学成就，即按科学来分析劳动中的体力动作，消除多余的笨拙的动作，制定最精确的工作方法，实行最完善的统计和监督制等等方面所获得的成就”。列宁的这种科学分析的态度是我们应该学习的。我们在破旧立新的过程中，必须根据新的实践需要，采取科学分析的态度，把旧规章制度中合理的部分吸收到新的规章制度里来。
    群众的生产实践是检验规章制度是否合理（即是否符合客观规律）的唯一标准。在决定哪些规章制度该保留、哪些该修改、哪些该废除以及废除以后怎样立的时候，都必须依靠群众，先发动群众揭露矛盾，然后依靠群众解决矛盾。在建立新的规章制度的时候，既要吸收工人群众的好经验，又要吸收科学技术人员、管理干部进行试验和鉴定，然后由点到面地推广执行。从群众中来，经过总结和提高，再到群众中坚持下去，这就是我们党的群众路线的工作方法。贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，不但保证规章制度的改革工作进行得又快又好，而且能够提高群众贯彻执行规章制度的自觉性。对于技术管理方面的规章制度的破和立，不仅要放手发动群众和经过试验，而且要经过有关的主管部门审查批准才能实行。这是为了使规章制度的破和立能够取得更好的效果。
    1958年全国许多企业在党委的领导下，依靠广大的职工群众，对解放后积累起来的规章制度进行了一次检查，修改和废除了其中许多不合理的部分，建立了许多新的合理的规章制度。这不仅直接推动了去年的大跃进，也为今后更大的跃进造就了有利的形势。但是，在去年的改革工作中，由于缺乏经验和时间短促，有些企业破了以后还没有立、或者破得多、立得少。今年，我们要争取我国国民经济实现更大的跃进，建设和生产的规模比去年扩大多了，对于工程质量、产品质量等的要求也比去年更为严格，没有必要的合理的行政管理制度和技术管理制度是不行的。为了更好更全面地完成和超额完成国家计划，每个企业必须在党委领导下，在大搞以技术革命为中心的群众运动中，进一步发扬广大职工群众的敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，根据前一阶段改革规章制度的经验，除了对那些应该破但没有破，或者破得不彻底的规章制度，继续进行改革外，当前主要的任务是“立”，即根据生产和建设的需要，把破了以后没有立的规章制度立起来，特别要重视那些对生产和建设关系较大的规章制度，如党委领导下的厂长负责制，各种责任制，各种工艺规程和操作规程，工程质量和产品质量检验制度，原材料管理（包括质量检验）制度、安全制度等等，这些制度必须要大立，立了要行，行要彻底，这是保证实现1959年更大跃进计划的一项不可缺少的重要措施。
