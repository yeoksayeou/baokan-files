Each Side Cooperates Greatly, Accelerating Steel’s Maturation
Tianjin, Lushun-Dalian, and Shanghai's Many Machine Factories Vigorously Build Rolling Mills

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 19th dispatch) Workers in more than 30 machinery and electrical factories in Tianjin are rushing to manufacture various rolling mill equipment to support the expansion of key steel plants.

After receiving the rolling mill production tasks, the workers of more than 30 machinery and electrical factories in Tianjin were all in high spirits and launched various forms of labor competitions to ensure quality, schedule, and quantity. Many factory workers reviewed and calculated material quotas and work-hour quotas overnight after receiving the rolling mill blueprints. Some factories also measured and assigned the tasks to workshops, groups, and individuals, and the workers formulated weekly and daily work plans based on the tasks. Some factories lacked equipment, so the workers used their rest time to rush to make indigenous equipment or special machine tools.

To resolutely complete this task, many factories, from groups to departments, launched a technical revolution movement. The rolling mill mainframe undertaken by Dehe Instrument Factory weighed six or seven tons for just one frame. The factory's existing tools were insufficient, so leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined to research and trial-produce various tools. Originally scheduled to be manufactured and put into production on March 15, the experiment was successful on the morning of the 12th and put into production on the same day; the processing efficiency of some parts was more than doubled compared to the quota.

In the process of manufacturing this batch of rolling mill equipment, the workers resolutely implemented the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." As soon as many factories received the rolling mill production tasks, the workers stopped producing generally non-urgent products and produced rolling mill equipment. When the raw materials for producing rolling mills were temporarily unavailable or the specifications were incomplete, the factories used their own raw materials for producing general products to support them. Workers at the No. 1 Machinery Factory have used raw materials from their own factory to produce more than 500 rolling mill parts. After learning that the No. 1 Machinery Factory lacked copper materials for rushing to manufacture rolling mills, the workers of the Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory took the initiative to lend the factory all the copper materials needed to produce rolling mill equipment.

(Our dispatch) Workers in the machinery industry sector of Lushun-Dalian are continuing to promote the spirit of great collaboration based on the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," and are rushing to produce the state-assigned manufacturing tasks for rolling mill equipment.

In rushing to manufacture rolling mill equipment, the workers of all machinery factories in the city continued to carry forward the spirit of great collaboration from last year when they manufactured metallurgical equipment. The two sets of 2300 medium plate machines undertaken by Dalian General Machinery Factory and the two sets of 1200 thin plate machines undertaken by Lushun-Dalian Machinery Factory could not cast steel castings because neither factory had steelmaking equipment. Dalian Shipyard, Dalian Rolling Stock Plant, Dalian Diesel Engine Plant, Dalian Crane Machinery Plant, and Dalian Steel Plant, which have steelmaking equipment, jointly undertook the collaborative task of casting more than 1,400 tons of steel castings for them. Because the rolling mill equipment is technically complex and the product is large, it is difficult for a single factory to complete the manufacturing task. In this case, if the factory undertaking the manufacturing task has difficulties, several factories will cooperate and collaborate to manufacture it together. Auxiliary parts such as elevators, longitudinal and transverse shearing machines, post-machine roller tables, and main reducers used on the medium plate machine manufactured by the General Machinery Factory are manufactured with the help of Dalian No. 1 Machinery Factory, Dalian Chemical Plant, and other units. The Lushun-Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing 1200 thin plate machines, has received cooperation from Dalian No. 2 Machinery Factory, Dalian Refrigerator Factory, and other units. To complete the models for these rolling mill equipment, almost all the wood pattern processing forces in the city were mobilized. To complete the production task of rolling mills as soon as possible, various factories and enterprises have also concentrated existing materials for use on rolling mills. The hundreds of tons of steel castings and forgings produced by Dalian Shipyard have used materials paid for by themselves; Dalian Diesel Engine Plant also sacrificed itself for others when casting rolling mill castings for fraternal factories, paying for more than 200 tons of scrap steel. The Lushun-Dalian Materials Bureau and the Lushun-Dalian Machinery Bureau have also allocated a large amount of scrap steel, coal, calcium carbide, gasoline, and other materials for the manufacture of rolling mills.

(Our dispatch) Shanghai's machinery industry is focusing on the production of rolling mill equipment while closely grasping equipment for mining, coal washing and coking, power stations, and drainage and irrigation. As of recently, nine sets of rolling mill equipment have been manufactured, with an annual steel production capacity of 375,000 tons.

To produce more rolling mills in the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Machinery Industry Bureau recently held a series of specialized rolling mill production meetings and on-site meetings, and carefully arranged the shafts and auxiliary machines of several rolling mills planned to be completed in March. To cooperate with the completion of the rolling mill task, the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau ensured that the steel castings required for the rolling mills planned to be produced in March would be supplied by March 12. The China Casting Steel Plant under the jurisdiction of the Machinery Bureau also guaranteed to deliver the steel castings at the same time.

Due to the heavy tasks and tight schedule, each contracting factory is actively taking various resolute and effective measures while arranging the production schedule. For example, in addition to vigorously developing simple equipment to solve key processing problems, Jingye Machine Factory is also brainstorming on process and processing progress. The reducer base used on the 1200 thin plate machine weighs 23 tons in total. Originally, the gold processing cycle was 62 days and the process had 16 steps; after the workers studied it, the cycle was compressed to 40 days and the process was reduced to 14 steps, and now the cycle has been compressed to 30 days again. The workers of the factory are determined to rush out this batch of rolling mills this month.

### 各方大协作　催钢快成材  天津旅大上海许多机械工厂大造轧钢机

    各方大协作　催钢快成材
    天津旅大上海许多机械工厂大造轧钢机
    本报天津19日电　天津市三十多个机电工厂的职工正在突击赶制各种轧钢设备，支援重点钢厂的扩建。
    天津市三十多个机电工厂的职工们在接到轧钢机的生产任务以后，个个意气风发，纷纷开展了保质、保期、保量的各种形式的劳动竞赛。很多工厂的职工在接到轧钢机的图纸以后，连夜审查计算材料定额和工时定额。有些工厂并把任务分别按车间、小组、个人进行测算和下达，工人们就根据任务制定了每周每日的工作计划。有些工厂设备不足，职工们就利用工休时间，突击赶制土设备或专用机床。
    为了坚决完成这一任务，许多工厂从小组到科室纷纷掀起了技术革命运动。德和仪器厂承制的轧钢机主机，光一个架子就有六、七吨重，工厂现有的工具不足应用，于是领导干部、技术人员和工人就结合起来研究试制各种工具。原来计划在3月15日制成投入生产，结果在12日上午就试验成功，在当天投入了生产；有些部件的加工效率比定额提高了一倍以上。
    在制造这批轧钢设备的过程中，职工们坚决贯彻执行了“全国一盘棋”的方针。许多工厂一接到轧钢机的生产任务，职工们就把一般不急迫的产品停下来，生产轧钢设备。当生产轧钢机的原材料一时调运不到，或者规格不全时，工厂就把自己生产一般产品的原材料拿来垫扬。机械一厂的职工使用他们本厂的原材料，已经生产了五百多个轧钢机零件。内燃机制配厂的职工知道机械一厂赶制轧钢机缺少铜料以后，就主动地借给这个工厂生产轧钢设备所需的全部铜料。
    本报讯　旅大市机械工业部门的职工正根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，继续发扬大协作精神，突击生产国家分配给旅大市的轧钢设备的制造任务。
    全市各机械厂职工在赶制轧钢设备中，继续发扬了去年制造冶金设备时的大协作精神。大连通用机器厂承制的两套2300的中板机和旅大机器厂承担的两套1200薄板机，由于两厂都没有炼钢设备，无法铸造铸钢件。有炼钢设备的大连造船厂、大连机车车辆厂、大连柴油机厂、大连起重机器厂和大连钢厂，共同为他们担负了铸造一千四百多吨铸钢件的协作任务。由于轧钢设备技术复杂，产品体积庞大，单靠一个厂很难完成制造任务，在这种情况下，承担制造任务的工厂有了困难，就由几个厂来配合协作，共同制造。通用机器厂制造的中板机上用的升降机、纵横剪钢机、机后辊道、主减速机等辅助部件，由大连机械一厂、大连化工厂等单位帮助制造。担负制造1200薄板机的旅大机器制造厂，则得到大连机械二厂、大连冷冻机厂等单位的协作。为了完成这些轧钢设备的模型，几乎调动了全市所有单位的木型加工力量。为了早日完成轧钢机的生产任务，各个工厂企业还把现有的材料集中起来垫用在轧钢机上。大连造船厂已经生产出的几百吨铸钢件和锻件，用的就是自己垫付的材料；大连柴油机厂为兄弟厂铸造轧钢机铸件时，也舍己为人，垫上二百多吨废钢。旅大市物资局和旅大市机械局也调拨了大批废钢、煤炭、电石、汽油等物资，供制造轧钢机使用。
    本报讯　上海市机械工业在紧抓矿山、洗煤炼焦、电站、排灌等设备的同时，紧抓轧钢设备的生产。到最近为止，已制成九套轧钢设备，可年产钢材三十七万五千吨。
    为使今年第一季度中能生产更多的轧钢机，上海市机械工业局最近召开了一系列的轧钢机生产专业会议和现场会议，将3月份计划完成的几套轧钢机的轴，辅机仔细排队。上海冶金局为配合轧机任务的完成，对计划在三月份生产出来的轧机需要的铸钢件，保证在3月12日前供齐。机械局所属的中铸钢铁厂也保证同时交出铸钢件。
    由于任务重，时间紧，各承制厂在安排生产进度的同时，也积极采取各种坚决有力的措施。如精业机器厂除大搞简易设备解决加工关键以外，还在工艺上和加工进度上动脑筋。1200薄板机上用的减速机座总重有二十三吨，原来金加工的周期要六十二天，工序有十六道；经职工们研究以后，周期压缩到四十天，工序减少到十四道，现在又将周期压缩到三十天。该厂职工有决心要将这批轧机在这个月里赶出来。
