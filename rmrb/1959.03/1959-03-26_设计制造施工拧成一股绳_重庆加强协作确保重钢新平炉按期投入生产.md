According to the Chongqing Daily, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Construction Machine Tool Plant, and the Black Metalurgical Design Institute are implementing a "four-way coordination" among design, equipment manufacturing, construction and installation, and production units in the construction project of Chongqing Iron and Steel's open-hearth furnace. This is to strengthen collaboration, unify steps, and integrate the work of the four aspects into an organic whole, to speed up construction progress and ensure project quality, and to ensure the timely commissioning of the new open-hearth furnace.

The new open-hearth furnace project of Chongqing Iron and Steel is a key construction project. In order to ensure that this project is put into production on schedule, the units responsible for design, equipment manufacturing, construction and installation, and production and use, promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Ren Shigu, Deputy Manager of Chongqing Iron and Steel, and Ma Baoliang, Chief Mechanical Engineer, represented the production and use unit and the construction and installation unit. Meng Xianghu, Deputy Director of the Construction Machine Tool Plant, represented the equipment manufacturing unit. Su Weimin, Deputy Dean of the Black Metalurgical Design Institute, represented the design unit. They formed a "four-person group". After the establishment of this group, it established a certain meeting and contact system, jointly reviewed the design work, jointly arranged the progress of various major tasks, and organized collaboration and cooperation. This made the work plans of the design, equipment manufacturing, construction and installation departments closely linked to each other, forming a general plan. Various units also actively contacted relevant units when carrying out work. For example, when the Design Institute was designing the open-hearth furnace, it sent more than 30 technicians to Chongqing Iron and Steel and the production department and the construction and installation department to study together. When the equipment manufacturing plant manufactured equipment, it also frequently contacted the design and construction and installation departments. This allows for the rational arrangement of priorities based on the progress of the project. What should be done first and what should be done later, it can better implement parallel cross-flow operations and accelerate the speed of construction. For example, when they formulated a progress plan, the construction and installation unit proposed that in order to speed up the progress of the project, the crane in the new plant should be installed first so that this crane could be used during the general assembly of the open-hearth furnace. According to this requirement, the design department first designed the crane, and the equipment manufacturing plant also first manufactured the crane. Another example is that the feeder is a more critical piece of equipment, and design, manufacturing, and installation all lack experience. In order to avoid temporary problems that affect the progress of the entire project, each unit also ranks it first, so that problems can be discovered and improved in time. On the other hand, due to the close cooperation of the four aspects, everyone's wisdom is more fully concentrated, which can improve the quality of design and manufacturing work. It is also of great significance for solving some key problems in various links and avoiding rework and waste. For example, in order to strengthen the connection between design and mechanical manufacturing, the Black Metalurgical Design Institute sent a special person to reside in the Construction Machine Tool Plant, which is responsible for the overall management of equipment manufacturing, to assist the Construction Machine Tool Plant and other units in reviewing drawings, and immediately correcting errors when they are discovered.

This "four-person group" will work until the entire open-hearth furnace is built and put into production.

### 设计制造施工拧成一股绳  重庆加强协作确保重钢新平炉按期投入生产

    设计制造施工拧成一股绳
    重庆加强协作确保重钢新平炉按期投入生产
    据重庆日报消息　重庆钢铁公司、建设机床厂、黑色冶金设计院等单位，在负责重庆钢铁公司平炉的建设工程中，实行设计、设备制造、施工安装和生产使用单位的“四配合”，以加强协作，统一步调，把四个方面的工作组成一个有机的整体，来加快建设进度和保证工程质量，确保新建平炉的按期投入生产。
    重钢的新建平炉工程是一项重点建设工程。为了保证这项工程按期投入生产，负责设计、设备制造、施工安装和生产使用的单位，发扬了共产主义的协作精神，并由重钢副经理任师古、总机械师马宝良代表生产使用单位和施工安装单位，建设机床厂副厂长孟祥祜代表设备制造单位，黑色冶金设计院副院长苏维民代表设计单位，成立了一个“四人小组”。这个小组成立以后，即确定了一定的会议和联系制度，共同审查设计工作，共同安排各项主要工作的进度，组织协作配合，使设计、设备制造、施工安装等各个部门的工作计划，互相紧密衔接，形成一个总的计划。各个单位在进行工作时，也主动与有关单位取得联系。如设计院在进行平炉设计时，就派出三十多名技术人员在重钢和生产部门、施工安装部门共同研究，设备制造厂在制造设备时，也和设计、施工安装部门经常联系。这样做，一方面可以根据工程进度先后缓急的需要，哪些先做，哪些后做，进行合理的安排，可以更好地实行平行交叉流水作业，加快建设的速度。例如他们在制订进度计划时，施工安装单位提出：为了加快工程进度，新厂房的行车要首先装好，以便平炉总装时利用这部行车，根据这个要求，设计部门就先设计行车，设备制造厂也先制造行车。又如送料机是比较关键的一项设备，设计、制造、安装都缺乏经验，为了避免临时发生问题，影响整个工程的进度，各个单位也把它排在前面，以便及时发现问题，及时改进。另一方面，由于四个方面密切配合，更充分地集中了大家的智慧，可以提高设计、制造等工作的质量，对于解决各个环节上产生的一些关键问题，避免返工浪费，也有很大作用。例如为了加强设计与机械制造之间的联系，黑色冶金设计院就派有专人住在负责总管设备制造的单位建设机床厂，协助建设机床厂等单位审查图纸，发现错误即立即改正。
    这个“四人小组”将工作到整个平炉建成并投入生产时为止。
