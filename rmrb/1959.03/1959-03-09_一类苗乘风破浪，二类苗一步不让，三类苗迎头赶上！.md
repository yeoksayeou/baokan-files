Xinhua Daily, Jiangsu, published an editorial on March 4th titled "First-Class Seedlings Forge Ahead, Second-Class Seedlings Give No Ground, Third-Class Seedlings Catch Up!" to strive for large-scale and high-yield summer crops. The editorial is excerpted as follows:

The Jiangsu Provincial Representative Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction put forward a powerful battle cry in order to strive for high yields of summer crops over large areas: "First-Class Seedlings Forge Ahead, Second-Class Seedlings Give No Ground, Third-Class Seedlings Catch Up!" This is a slogan of continuous revolution, a slogan of continuous promotion.

The editorial said that according to the results of inspections in various places in the past half month, most wheat fields have basically met the requirements of many seedlings, uniform seedlings, thick seedlings, and strong seedlings. However, there is also a small part of wheat that is planted too densely, and a small part that is planted too late, and does not grow very well. How to divide the seedlings into first, second, and third classes? Having many seedlings is certainly a sign to distinguish between first, second, and third class seedlings, but it is not the only sign. Some wheat fields have many seedlings, even millions or more per mu, but they are weak and cannot be called first-class seedlings. Only those that correctly implement reasonable close planting, with sufficient, uniform, and strong seedlings, can truly be called first-class seedlings. The number of plants per mu varies from place to place, generally around 600,000 to 1 million seedlings per mu, and some are around 300,000 to 500,000 seedlings per mu. Second-class seedlings are generally relatively strong, but not very uniform, with around 300,000 to 400,000 seedlings per mu. Third-class seedlings are generally planted too late, and the management is rough, so the wheat seedlings are yellow, thin, and poorly developed, with most having around 200,000 seedlings per mu.

The editorial pointed out that the province's three wheat crops are currently in the returning green and jointing period. How to strengthen the management of various types of wheat seedlings, strive for strong seedlings, uniform seedlings, good differentiation of young ears, until the stalks are hard, there are many ears, the ears are large, and the grains are full, is a central issue.

First-class seedlings must forge ahead and continue to promote growth. The editorial said that some people see that the first-class seedlings have a large number of seedlings and become complacent, thinking that they can relax after passing the returning green stage. In fact, they cannot relax at all. Passing the returning green stage is only passing the first stage, and there are still the jointing stage, the heading stage, the flowering and grain filling stage, and finally the harvest stage. Many seedlings do not mean uniform seedlings, thick seedlings, and strong seedlings, let alone many ears, large ears, many grains, and full grains. If we only calculate the yield from the existing number of seedlings, thinking that how many seedlings will definitely grow how many ears, how many grains, and harvest how many catties, that is a dangerous self-intoxication. We do not deny the role of many seedlings in increasing production, but the yield of the three wheat crops is composed of many factors such as the number of plants, the number of ears, the number of grains, and the weight of the grains. Therefore, we must never think that the basic number of seedlings is fixed, and that this equals a fixed harvest. The management of first-class seedlings can only add icing on the cake, and must never stop, and can only be conscientious, and must never be paralyzed and complacent.

The difference between second-class seedlings and first-class seedlings is that the wheat seedlings are not strong enough and not uniform enough. As long as the measures are strengthened, they can completely catch up with and exceed the first-class seedlings. Some people compared the current wheat seedlings with those of last year, and saw that this year's second-class seedlings are growing better than last year's first-class seedlings at the same time, and they feel somewhat satisfied, and they do not promptly make up for some measures that have not kept up. This is wrong. Second-class seedlings must resolutely not give ground, and not miss a single link.

The editorial said that third-class seedlings deserve special attention. From a regional perspective, there are third-class seedlings in backward areas, and there are also third-class seedlings in advanced areas. From the perspective of each field, third-class fields certainly grow third-class seedlings, but there are also third-class seedlings in first and second-class fields. Generally speaking, more third-class seedlings are in remote fields, border fields, scattered fields, low-lying fields, fields with poor soil quality that are planted too late, and especially in suburban areas where vegetables and cash crops account for a large proportion. The appearance of third-class seedlings is objectively due to planting too late, but subjectively it is also due to insufficient enthusiasm, relaxed management, and some places even failing to manage them. The editorial pointed out that the province estimates that there are three million mu of third-class seedlings. If each mu yields 500 jin, then three million mu will yield 1.5 billion jin, which is close to one-sixth of the total output of the three wheat crops last year, enough for three million people to eat for a year. Therefore, the quality of the management of third-class seedlings is directly related to the realization of the province's three-wheat increase plan. This year's third-class fields generally have 200,000 to 300,000 seedlings per mu. Last year's first-class fields also had only 200,000 to 300,000 seedlings per mu, but last year in Changshu and other places, there were high-yield examples of wheat fields with 200,000 to 300,000 seedlings per mu yielding 600 to 700 jin. Therefore, as long as we strengthen the management of the existing third-class seedlings, promptly replant seedlings, thin seedlings, and apply top dressing reasonably, there is complete hope of catching up with or exceeding the yield of last year's first-class seedlings.

The editorial also pointed out that before the crop growth is fixed, first, second, and third-class seedlings will transform into each other due to the quality of people's management. This is historical experience and is worth being vigilant about. Blind complacency about first and second-class seedlings and lack of confidence in third-class seedlings are incorrect.

How can we achieve "First-Class Seedlings Forge Ahead, Second-Class Seedlings Give No Ground, Third-Class Seedlings Catch Up"? The editorial said that the most important thing is to take effective measures according to the needs of the crop growth period and the different growth conditions, adapt to local conditions, prescribe the right medicine, promote growth by looking at the seedlings, and strengthen management in sections and categories, so as to promote various types of wheat seedlings to achieve the requirements of increasing plants, increasing ears, increasing grains, and increasing grain weight. Some areas organize commune members who manage large fields to "learn from the masters" from commune members who manage basic fields, so as to drive large fields with basic fields, and learn the processing and management methods of first and second-class seedlings to do a good job in the processing and management of third-class seedlings. Strengthening management measures is conducive to large-scale and high-yield three-wheat production.

The editorial concluded by pointing out that the slogan "First-Class Seedlings Forge Ahead, Second-Class Seedlings Give No Ground, Third-Class Seedlings Catch Up!" gives great inspiration to people doing all kinds of work. There are first, second, and third-class seedlings in the three wheat crops, and there are also distinctions between "first, second, and third-class seedlings" in various crops, various tasks, and various units, that is, there are distinctions between advanced, intermediate, and backward. In the process of the development of things, the state of advanced, intermediate, and backward always exists. The question is that the advanced must be more advanced, the intermediate must not be complacent, and the backward must catch up.

### 一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上！

专栏：

    一类苗乘风破浪，
    二类苗一步不让，
    三类苗迎头赶上！
    江苏新华日报3月4日为力争夏熟作物大面积高产，以“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上！”为题发表社论。社论摘要如下：
    江苏省农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，为了力争夏熟作物大面积高产，提出了一个有力的战斗口号：“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上！”这是一个不断革命的口号，不断促进的口号。
    社论说，根据最近半月各地检查的结果，大部分麦田基本上达到苗多、苗匀、苗粗、苗壮的要求。但是，也有小部分麦子种得过密，小部分麦子种得过迟，而长得又不大好。怎样划分一、二、三类苗呢？苗多，固然是区别一、二、三类苗的一个标志，但不是唯一的标志。有些麦田苗数虽多，甚至每亩多到百万或百万以上，但生长细弱，并不能叫做一类苗。只有那些正确贯彻合理密植，苗足、苗匀、苗壮的，才能真正叫做一类苗。这类苗每亩的株数各地不一，一般每亩在六十万到百万苗上下，也有的在三十万到五十万苗上下。二类苗，一般是苗比较粗壮，但不大均匀，每亩苗数在三十万到四十万上下。三类苗，一般是种得太迟，加上管理粗糙，因此麦苗黄瘦，发育不良，每亩苗数大多在二十万苗上下。
    社论指出，目前全省三麦都处在返青拔节期，如何加强各类麦苗的管理，力争苗壮、苗匀、幼穗分化好，直到秆子硬、穗多、穗大、粒饱满，是个中心问题。
    一类苗必须乘风破浪，继续促进。社论说，有些人看到一类苗苗数较多，就自满起来，认为过了返青关，可以松口气了。其实，一口气也松不得。过了返青关，只不过是过了第一关，下面还有拔节关，抽穗关，扬花灌浆关，最后还有一道收获关。苗多，并不等于苗匀、苗粗、苗壮，更不等于穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱满。如果仅仅从现有苗数计算产量，以为多少苗就一定可以长多少穗、多少粒、收多少斤，那就是一种危险的自我陶醉。我们不否定苗多对增产的作用，但三麦产量是由株数、穗数、粒数、粒重等许多因素构成的。因此绝不能以为苗数基本定局就等于丰收定局。对一类苗的管理，只能锦上添花，绝不能停步不前，只能兢兢业业，绝不能麻痹自满。
    二类苗与一类苗的差别，是麦苗不够壮、不够匀。只要措施加码，完全可以赶上并超过一类苗。有些人把现在的麦苗与去年对比了一下，看到今年二类苗比去年同期的一类苗还要长得好些，便有些心满意足，明知有些措施没有跟上，也不及时补足。这是不对的。对二类苗要坚决做到一步不让，一环不漏。
    社论说，对于三类苗值得特别重视。从地区来看三类苗落后地区有，先进地区也有。从每块田来看，三类田固然长三类苗，但一、二类田里也有三类苗。一般说，三类苗较多的还是一些远田、边境田、零星田、低洼田、土质较差又种得过迟的田，特别是一些蔬菜和经济作物比重较大的市郊区。出现三类苗，客观上固然是由于种得过迟，但主观上也由于干劲不大足，放松了管理，某些地方甚至不去管理。社论指出，全省三类苗估算有三百万亩，只要加强管理，如果每亩收五百斤，三百万亩就收十五亿斤，接近去年三麦总产量的六分之一，够三百万人吃一年。因此，三类苗的管理好坏，直接关系到全省三麦增产计划的实现。今年的三类田每亩一般都有二、三十万苗，去年的一类田也不过二、三十万苗，但去年在常熟等地却出现过二、三十万苗的麦田亩产六、七百斤的高产典型。所以，只要加强对现有三类苗的管理，及时补苗、间苗，合理追肥，完全有希望赶上或超过去年一类苗的产量。
    社论还指出，在作物生长定局以前，一、二、三类苗都会因为人们管理的好坏，而相互转化。这是历史经验，很值得警惕。对一、二类苗盲目自满，对三类苗缺乏信心，是不对的。
    怎样才能做到“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上”呢？社论说，最重要的是根据作物生长期的需要和生长的不同情况，因时因地制宜，采取有效措施，对症下药，看苗促进，分段分类地加强管理，促使各类麦苗都能达到增株、增穗、增粒、增粒重的要求。有些地区组织管理大田的社员向管理基本田的社员“拜师取经”，做到以基本田带动大田，学习对一、二类苗的加工管理方法，来搞好三类苗的加工管理。加强管理措施，有利于三麦大面积高产。
    社论最后指出，“一类苗乘风破浪，二类苗一步不让，三类苗迎头赶上！”这个口号，给做各种工作的人，很大启发。三麦当中有一、二、三类苗，各项作物、各项工作与各个单位当中，也有“一、二、三类苗”之分，也就是有先进、中间、落后之分。在事物发展过程中，先进、中间、落后的状况总是存在的，问题在于先进更要先进，中间的不苟安，落后的迎头赶上去。
