Xinhua News Agency, March 28th -- TASS reports: British Prime Minister Macmillan, Foreign Secretary Lloyd, and other accompanying personnel left Kiev on the 28th to visit Leningrad.

At the Kiev airport, Macmillan said in his farewell address that the people of all countries are willing to be friendly and hope to cooperate with each other. The leaders of all countries have an obligation to formulate and implement policies that can realize these aspirations.

The British Prime Minister arrived in Kiev on the 26th.

On the same day, Macmillan separately called on Korotchenko, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, and Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Ukraine.

On the same day, Kalchenko hosted a banquet in honor of Macmillan. In his welcoming speech, Kalchenko said: We advocate that the idea of peaceful coexistence between all countries and nationalities be fully realized.

Macmillan said at the banquet that the people of our two countries live under different social and economic systems. But undoubtedly, we have something in common, that is, the people of our two countries both hope to establish world peace.

Macmillan said that previous talks have been a valuable preparation and a good prerequisite for subsequent broad international negotiations. He said, I remain convinced that differences between countries can and should be understood through full discussion, and that these differences should be resolved with the sincerity of reaching a fair agreement.

    麦克米伦赴列宁格勒访问
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社报道：英国首相麦克米伦、外交大臣劳埃德和其他随行人员28日离开基辅前往列宁格勒访问。
    麦克米伦在基辅的机场上致告别词说，一切国家的人民都愿意友好和希望相互合作。各国的领导人士有义务制定和执行能够实现这些愿望的政策。
    英国首相是在26日到达基辅的。
    当天，麦克米伦分别拜会了乌克兰最高苏维埃主席团主席科罗特钦科和乌克兰部长会议主席卡尔钦科。
    同一天，卡尔钦科设宴招待麦克米伦。卡尔钦科在致欢迎词时说：我们主张让各国和各族人民和平共处的思想得到最充分的体现。
    麦克米伦在宴会席上讲话说，我们两国人民在不同的社会制度和经济制度下生活着。但是，无疑地，我们有着共同之处，那就是我们两国人民都希望建立世界和平。
    麦克米伦说，在此以前的历次会谈对随后举行广泛的国际谈判，是一个有价值的准备和良好的前提。他说，我仍然坚信，能够而且应该通过充分讨论来认识国与国之间的分歧，并应怀着达成公正协议的诚意来解决这些分歧。
