To guarantee the preliminary completion of the iron and steel joint enterprise this year, the 100,000 workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are fighting arduously with soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, to achieve a double leap forward in both capital construction and production this year. More than twenty system engineering projects, including steelmaking, rolling steel, and ore mining, will be completed ahead of schedule, and hundreds of thousands and millions of tons of ore, coke, pig iron, steel ingots, steel, and refractory materials will be produced, preliminarily forming a continuous production iron and steel joint enterprise.

Currently, construction is being accelerated in all factories of Wuhan Iron and Steel. At the foot of Daye Iron Mine, which had the top of its mountain removed, two sets of huge crushers have been built, and the main ore dressing plant and workshops for filtering and concentration are under construction. The No. 2 blast furnace, which is even larger than the No. 1 blast furnace, is also under active construction. The main steelmaking plant building, including several 500-ton open-hearth furnaces, has had two rows of fortress-like concrete column foundations poured, and auxiliary projects such as material rooms, mold preparation rooms, ingot stripping rooms, and mixer furnaces serving the open-hearth furnace production are also under construction simultaneously. The chimney, coal storage tower, and furnace body of the No. 3 coke oven have all been built.

This year is a decisive year for the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel. Its capital construction investment has increased by 25% compared to last year. A total of twenty-eight system engineering projects, from mining, ore dressing, sintering, coking, and refractory materials to ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling steel, will be put into production successively. This year, it will also produce 4.9 million tons of ore, 1.58 million tons of coke, 1.2 million tons of pig iron, 500,000 tons of steel, 150,000 tons of steel, and 200,000 tons of refractory materials. The task is very arduous. After repeated studies, the General Party Committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel called on all employees to carry forward the communist spirit, center on the technological revolution, and launch an increase production and practice economy movement. All employees actively responded to the call of the General Party Committee and formulated plans combining hard work and smart work to ensure that this year's leap forward would be greater, better, and more comprehensive than last year's.

The amount of steel, cement, and equipment required by Wuhan Iron and Steel this year is very large. Since September of last year, the General Party Committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel decided that while the whole country supported Wuhan Iron and Steel, it would also vigorously develop the machinery manufacturing industry and the raw materials industry to solve some of the problems itself. In January, they had already manufactured ninety-two machine tools, two hundred and twenty-eight electrical equipment, one hundred and forty-five lifting equipment, and twenty-nine smelting equipment.

    保证今年初步建成钢铁联合企业
    武钢十万职工紧张战斗
    本报武汉10日电　武汉钢铁公司十万名职工，正以冲天干劲和无穷智慧进行艰苦奋战，保证今年做到基建、生产双跃进，将炼钢、轧钢、造矿等二十多项系统工程提前建成，并生产出数以十万吨、百万吨计算的矿石、焦炭、生铁、钢锭、钢材和耐火材料，初步形成连续生产的钢铁联合企业。
    现在，武钢各厂都在加紧建设。在削去了一座山顶的大冶铁山脚下，已建起两组巨大的破碎机，并正在修建选矿主厂房和过滤、浓缩等车间。比一号高炉更大的二号高炉，也正在积极进行建筑。包括数座五百吨大平炉的炼钢主厂房已浇灌好两排城垣似的混凝土柱基，为平炉生产服务的材料间、整模间、脱锭间和混铁炉等附属工程都在同时施工。三号焦炉的烟囱、贮煤塔和炉体都已建起。
    今年是武钢建设决定性的一年。它的基建投资比去年增长25％，从采矿、选矿、烧结、炼焦、耐火材料到炼铁、炼钢、轧钢共有二十八项系统工程要相继投入生产。它今年还要生产出四百九十万吨矿石、一百五十八万吨焦炭、一百二十万吨生铁、五十万吨钢、十五万吨钢材和二十万吨耐火材料。任务十分艰巨。武钢总党委经过反复研究，号召全体职工发扬共产主义精神，以技术革命为中心，开展增产节约运动，全体职工都积极响应总党委的号召，订出苦干和巧干结合的规划，保证做到今年的跃进比去年更大、更好、更全面。
    武钢今年需用钢材、水泥和设备数量十分浩大。武钢总党委从去年9月起，就决定在全国支援武钢的同时，大办机械制造工业和原材料工业，自己解决一部分问题。他们元月份已制出了九十二台机床、二百二十八台电器设备、一百四十五台起重设备和二十九台冶炼设备。（附图片）
