    Providing Short Plays for Amateur Theater Troupes
    The bi-monthly "Short Plays" (originally named "Scripts" Rural Edition) mainly serves amateur theater troupes of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Its most prominent feature is that each issue uses the majority of its space to publish short plays closely linked to the current real-life struggles. For example, recently published short operas, song dramas, and spoken dramas reflecting the great leap forward in production and the technical revolution on the industrial front, and reflecting the spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation movement on the agricultural front are numerous. Among them, works such as "Blooming Everywhere," "Two Red Flags," "A Day and Night of Battle," "Sisters-in-Law Looking at Paintings," "General and Soldier," and "Shen Xi Makes Fertilizer" are all lively in content and form, and are well-received by readers.
    Amateur theater troupes, with limited performance experience, often encounter difficulties when rehearsing a play. To better assist amateur troupes in rehearsing well, this publication also appropriately includes rehearsal instructions and song drama scores. In addition, to guide amateur authors in creation, it regularly publishes some popular and short articles, such as the serialized "Common Sense of Playwriting." The column "Everyone Asks Questions, Everyone Discusses Problems" has discussed the lyrics of operas and other issues related to script creation, which is meaningful for amateur authors to further master theatrical techniques and improve writing skills.

    为业余剧团提供小戏
    “小剧本”半月刊（原名叫“剧本”农村版）主要是为工农群众业余剧团服务的，它的最显著的特色，就是每期以大部分篇幅发表紧密结合当前现实生活斗争的小戏。例如，最近发表的反映工业战线上的生产大跃进与技术革命、反映农业战线上春耕积肥运动的各种小型的戏曲、歌剧、话剧就不少，其中像“遍地开花”、“两面红旗”、“战斗的一昼夜”、“姑嫂看画”、“将军与战士”、“申喜造肥”等，都是内容生动、形式活泼，为读者所欢迎的小剧本。
    业余剧团在演出经验不多的情况下，排好一出戏也常常会遇到一些困难，这个刊物为了更好地帮助业余剧团把戏排好，也适当地附有排演说明与歌剧曲谱；此外，对指导业余作者创作，也经常发表一些通俗短小的文章，如连载的“写戏常识”等。该刊开辟的“大家提问题、大家谈问题”这一栏，曾经讨论过歌剧的唱词以及其他有关剧本创作的问题，这对业余作者如何进一步掌握戏剧的技巧，提高写作能力是有意义的。（春）
