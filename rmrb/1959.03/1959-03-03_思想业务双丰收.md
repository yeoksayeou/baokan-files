Double Harvest in Ideology and Academics

    Teachers and students of the Chinese People's University who were sent to the people's communes in the suburban districts of Haidian, Fengtai, and Changping in Beijing, after several months of part-work and part-study, have achieved tremendous harvests in ideology, labor, and learning.
    After being sent down, teachers and students from various departments, combined with their majors and reality, went deep into the masses to conduct extensive investigations and scientific research. Teachers and students worked together to write a large number of scientific papers and monographs. Class 5 of the third grade of the Economics Department wrote a total of three books and forty-five papers of various sizes, exceeding the total number of papers written in the two years since enrollment by more than ten times. The Planning Department not only wrote a large number of papers but also prepared teaching materials for the newly added courses "People's Commune Economy" and "Problems of Productive Forces Allocation," and also reformed the lecture notes for the "National Economic Plan" course. The fourth-grade Finance Class of the Finance Department, together with the commune members, formulated four systems, including the "Financial System," "Custody System," and "Canteen Accounting," which were warmly welcomed by the commune members.
    While participating in labor in the commune, the students also actively participated in various social works. The Planning Department established fifteen agricultural middle schools and spare-time schools in the Huangtugang People's Commune, with more than 1,000 commune cadres and members participating in the study. Many of the commune's nurseries and public canteens also had teachers and students serving as nursery workers and cooks. The students also organized a cultural troupe and performed for the commune members thousands of times.

    思想业务双丰收
    中国人民大学下放在京郊海淀、丰台、昌平等区人民公社的师生，经过几个月的半工半读，在思想、劳动、学习各方面都获得了巨大的丰收。
    各系师生下放后，都结合专业，结合实际，深入群众，进行广泛地调查和科学研究工作。师生通力协作，写出了大量的科学论文和专著。经济系三年级五班共写出了三本书，大小论文四十五篇，超过了入学两年来所写论文总和的十余倍。计划系不仅写了大量论文，并且为新增设的“人民公社经济”和“生产力配置问题”两门课程准备了教材，还改革了“国民经济计划”课程讲义。财政系四年级财务班和社员们，一齐制订了“财务制度”、“保管制度”、“食堂会计”等四项制度，受到了社员的热烈欢迎。
    同学们在公社不但参加劳动，而且还积极参加了各种社会工作。计划系在黄土岗人民公社办起了农业中学和业余学校十五所，有公社干部和社员一千多人参加学习。许多公社的托儿所，公共食堂里，也都有师生担任保育员、炊事员。同学们还组织了文工队，为社员作了上千次演出。
