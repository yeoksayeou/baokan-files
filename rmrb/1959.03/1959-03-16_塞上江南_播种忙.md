　　"The Land of Abundance North of the Border" is Busy Sowing
　　By our reporters Wang Dewen and Xie Shiyan
　　On the plains hailed as "The Land of Abundance North of the Border," the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has already opened the curtain on a mass-scale high-yield competition campaign.
　　From the towering Liupan Mountains to the stretching Helan Mountains, from the undulating southern mountainous areas to the boundless Yinchuan Plain, 620,000 production troops have sounded the bugle for the Great Leap Forward. This year, they aim to plant eight million mu of grain crops, with four million mu of basic farmland striving for an average yield of around 1,000 jin per mu, and one million mu of large-scale high-yield fields striving for an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu. They have put forward the resounding slogan: "Hui and Han farmers are of one mind, wholeheartedly aiming for 1,000 jin, working hard, working vigorously, and working skillfully, not stopping until complete victory is won!" striving to double the region's total grain output this year. In recent months, the fields and roads of the Yinchuan Plain have been filled with rolling yellow dust and bustling crowds. Tractors have also been mobilized on large swathes of land in more than a dozen state farms and various people's communes. Many people's communes have established spring sowing acceptance teams to inspect and sow one piece of land at a time; after sowing one piece of land, they check it to ensure the quality of spring sowing.
　　Along many places under the Helan Mountains, although the climate is relatively cold, the commune members say: "No matter how frozen the earth, it cannot freeze our determination!" Holding up iron hoes, they crack open the frozen soil and sow the seeds of a great harvest into the earth.
　　Although the Liupan Mountains in the south are still covered in silver, a scene of boiling activity is unfolding at the foot of the mountains. The Chengjiao Commune in Guyuan County in this area has challenged the brother communes in the five counties of the Guyuan Special District. The commune's 11,000 mu of large-scale high-yield fields are required to double their yield compared to last year, reaching 1,500 jin, and to cultivate 130 mu of "Guyuan Special District's Number One Field," requiring a yield of 3,000 jin per mu. Since the beginning of last winter, the Guyuan Special District has experienced little rain and snow. Not long ago, after a heavy snowfall, the people's communes within the special district, under the slogan of "One cart of ice and snow, one load of grain; carrying ice and accumulating snow to preserve spring moisture," transported the accumulated snow and frozen ice near the farmland to the fields for sowing. More than 50,000 people were mobilized throughout the special district. After three days of hard work, they carried ice and accumulated snow to preserve moisture on more than 73,000 mu, with each mu receiving more than one chi of ice and snow accumulation.
　　During the days of spring sowing, everyone's heart is set on a great harvest, and everyone is busy with spring plowing. In recent days, it has been difficult to find Party committee secretaries and commune leaders, as they have moved their offices to the fields, going deep into the front lines to direct spring sowing and laboring alongside the commune members. Wang Zhiqiang, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region and First Secretary of the Yinchuan Municipal Party Committee, and the secretaries of the Yinchuan Municipal Party Committee Secretariat have all gone deep into the fields to inspect spring plowing together with the commune cadres. In many places, cadres from banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, tax bureaus, and stores pick up hoes and baskets to labor in the communes after work. Farm implement factories in various towns send the urgently produced spring plowing tools to the communes.
　　In the first spring plowing season after communization, Hui and Han women appear particularly active. They no longer have to worry about their children or think about cooking. At the sound of the bell in the early morning, they throw themselves into production with energy. Some are driving large carts loaded with manure; some are holding whips tightly, striding forward with horse-drawn seeders; and some are swinging hammers, following behind tractors to break up clods of earth. What is particularly exciting is that female tractor drivers have emerged among them. When Zhou Lianying and Sun Xinghua first drove tractors, racing across the land of the Donghua Brigade of the Enhe Commune in Zhongning County, people watched them with eyes of surprise. On the day before the fourth production team of the Enhe Commune began spring sowing, commune members Lu Shuzhong and Shi Ruying got married. They broke the old custom of "the new bride not leaving the house for three days" and participated in spring plowing on the second day after their wedding.
　　This year, the spring in the Ningxia Plain is a spring of even greater leaps forward. It is indeed:
　　Ten thousand purples and reds, the spring scenery is beautiful, the land of abundance north of the border is busy sowing, the competition drums urge leaps forward, and the grain commander gallops towards 1,000 jin.

    “塞上江南”播种忙
    本报记者　王得温　谢石言
    在被誉为“塞上江南”的原野上，宁夏回族自治区的大面积丰产竞赛运动的序幕已经揭开。
    从巍峨的六盘山到绵延千里的贺兰山，从山峦起伏的南部山区到一望无际的银川平原，六十二万生产大军吹起了大跃进的号角。今年，他们要种植八百万亩粮食作物，其中四百万亩基本农田争取平均亩产一千斤左右，一百万亩大面积丰产田争取平均亩产达二千斤左右。他们提出了“回汉农民一条心，心心向着一千斤，苦干大干加巧干，不获全胜不收兵”的响亮口号，力争今年全区粮食翻一番。近月来，银川平原的田野里、道路上黄尘滚滚，人群熙攘。十几个国营农场和各公社大片的土地上，拖拉机也出动了。许多人民公社都成立了春播验收小组，验收一块，播种一块；下种一块，查一块，保证春播质量。
    沿着贺兰山下的许多地方，气候虽然较冷，但社员们说：“大地再冻，冻不了我们的决心！”他们高举铁锄，敲开冻土，向大地播下了大丰收的种子。
    南部的六盘山虽然依旧披着银装，山下却呈现着一片沸腾的景象。这个地区的固原县城郊公社，向固原专区五个县的兄弟公社提出挑战。全社一万一千亩大面积丰产田产量要比去年翻一番，达到一千五百斤，并培植一百三十亩“固原专区第一田”，要求亩产达三千斤。去年入冬以来，固原专区雨雪稀少，不久以前，在一场大雪之后，专区境内各人民公社在“一车冰雪一担粮，背冰积雪保春墒”的口号下，把农田附近的积雪和冻冰运到播种的田里。全专区出动五万多人，经过三天奋战，背冰积雪保墒七万三千多亩，每亩背冰积雪都在一尺以上。
    在春播的日子里，人人心向大丰收，人人都为春耕忙。这几天来，很难见到党委书记和公社的领导干部，他们把办公室搬到田间，深入现场，指挥春播，并和社员一起劳动。自治区副主席、银川市委第一书记王志强和银川市委书记处书记们都深入田间，和社干部一起，检查春耕。许多地方的银行、供销社、税局、商店的干部在下班后，拿起锄头和箩筐到公社劳动。各城镇的农具厂，把赶制好的春耕工具送到公社。
    在公社化后的第一个春耕季节，回汉妇女显得特别活跃。她们再也不用挂心孩子，惦记吃烧了。清晨，钟声一响，她们便精力充沛地投入生产。有的赶着装粪肥的大车；有的紧握鞭子，跟着马拉播种机快步前进；有的挥动着鎯头，跟在拖拉机后面打坷垃。特别使人兴奋的是，在她们中间，出现了女拖拉机手。当周莲英、孙兴华第一次驾驶着拖拉机，奔驰在中宁县恩和公社东华大队土地上时，人们带着惊喜的眼光，看着她们。在恩和公社第四生产队开始春播的前一天，社员陆术忠和史如英结婚了。他们破除了“新媳妇三天不出门”的老例，在婚后的第二天就参加春耕。
    今年，宁夏平原的春天，是个更大跃进的春天。正是：
    万紫千红春光好，塞上江南播种忙，竞赛战鼓催跃进，粮帅纵马奔千斤。
