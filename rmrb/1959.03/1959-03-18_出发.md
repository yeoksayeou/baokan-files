    Departure

Shaanxi Province has established a guiding ideology for wheat field management: to start from the most difficult situation. Where to depart to? To the peak of "thousands of catties per mu". How to deal with the most difficult situations? On the one hand, continue to actively strengthen field management; on the other hand, once encountered, mobilize the entire party and all the people to overcome them with all our strength. Based on the actual situation, they analyzed the many favorable conditions for this year's wheat harvest, and also analyzed the most difficult situations that may be encountered based on the laws of natural disasters over the years. They did not lower the target of thousands of catties per mu in the face of the most difficult situations, but instead gained more confidence in achieving thousands of catties per mu because they found a series of ways to overcome difficulties. They determined three key points based on objective laws: rust prevention, frost prevention, and lodging prevention, and also determined which key point to focus on at different times. Corresponding countermeasures were also taken for non-key points.

    "Departing" in this way will surely be able to climb the peak of large-scale high yield.

    When we "depart," we always start from one place and go to a farther place.

      "Starting from reality" means being down-to-earth and moving from the current reality to a higher reality than the current one.

      "Starting from the most difficult situation" means estimating all possible difficulties, taking reliable measures to avoid or overcome these difficulties, leaving these difficulties far behind, and forging ahead courageously.

    Some people often ignore the meaning of the verb "depart." When told to "start from reality," they only see a little bit of "reality" in front of their toes; instead of taking big steps to "depart" and move towards a higher reality, they are circling around in the narrow range of the "reality" in front of them. When told to "start from the most difficult situation," they only see all kinds of difficulties filling the road ahead; instead of mounting their war horses to "depart" and advance in the struggle against difficulties, they rein in their horses and hesitate to move forward. Several years ago, during a period of the agricultural cooperativization movement, weren't there people who got lost in the jungle of small-scale peasant economy when they heard that they had to "start from the small-scale peasant economy" and forgot to "depart"? But if a person stops there, the movement of things does not stop there. As a result, those who do not "depart" from the original place and move forward will inevitably not be able to stay in the same place forever; at least, relatively speaking, they will inevitably retreat.

    When we "depart," we always plan to go to a certain destination. We must reach the destination, and we will definitely be able to reach the destination! With a clear goal and full of such confidence, every step we take will be strong and powerful.

    We must have a sufficient estimate of the favorable conditions for reaching the destination, and have the skills to fully utilize these favorable conditions; we must also have a sufficient estimate of the difficulties that may be encountered along the way, and have the skills to overcome these difficulties. In this way, confidence is not empty, but truly firm and unshakable. Therefore, when we "depart," we must fully understand the reality, vigorously publicize the favorable conditions "to boost morale," and also imagine the most difficult situations that may be encountered.

    Imagining the most difficult situations that may be encountered is by no means to scare ourselves. What is the most difficult situation that may be encountered? We must not blindly imagine things without limits, imagine anything as a "hypothetical enemy," and become so nervous that "every bush and tree looks like an enemy soldier." Under certain conditions, difficulties have their maximum limit. The "most" we are talking about refers to the "most" under certain conditions.

    Under certain conditions, what difficulties will occur and to what extent can be roughly predicted based on the objective laws of the occurrence and development of things.

    The subjective is often not fully consistent with the objective, but only strives to approach the objective; we have not yet fully mastered the objective laws of some natural phenomena. Therefore, the difficulties that may occur on the road ahead are often not predicted exactly in accordance with reality.

    When imagining the difficulties that may be encountered, the principle should be: neither overestimate nor underestimate; in the absence of full mastery of objective laws, it is better to err on the side of some overestimation than to err on the side of underestimation. --This is to ensure that we stand in an invincible position.

    出发

    陕西省确定了小麦田间管理工作的一个指导思想——从最困难的情况出发。出发到哪里去呢？到“亩产千斤”的高峰上去。怎样对待最困难的情况呢？一方面，继续积极地加强田间管理工作；一方面，一旦遇到，就动员全党全民，全力战胜。他们根据实际情况分析了今年小麦丰收的许多有利条件，也根据历年自然灾害的规律分析了还可能碰到的最困难的情况。他们不是在最困难的情况面前降低亩产千斤的指标，而是因为找到一系列战胜困难的办法而对亩产千斤更增信心。他们根据客观规律确定了防锈、防霜、防倒伏三个重点，又确定了不同时期要集中力量对付哪个重点。对非重点也采取了相应的对策。
    这样“出发”，必能攀登上大面积高产的高峰。
    当我们“出发”的时候，总是以一个地方为起点，走到更远的地方去。
      “从实际出发”，这就是说，要脚踏实地，从当前的实际走向比当前的实际更高的地方。
      “从最困难的情况出发”，这就是说，要估计到一切可能碰到的困难，采取可靠的措施避免或者战胜这些困难，把这些困难远远地撇在背后，奋勇前进。
    有人却往往忽视“出发”这个动词的意义。说要
  “从实际出发”，他就只看到脚尖前边的一点点“实际”；不是迈开大步“出发”，走向更高的实际，而是在眼前的“实际”的狭小的范围内兜起圈子来了。说要“从最困难的情况出发”，他就只看到在前途上布满了各式各样的困难；不是跨上战马“出发”，在同困难搏斗中前进，而是勒缰下马，踟蹰不前。在几年以前，在农业合作化运动的一个时期，不是就有这样的人，听到要“从小农经济出发”就迷失在小农经济的丛林里面而忘记“出发”了吗？而一个人如果就此止步，事物的运动却并不就此停止。其结果，不由原地“出发”向前走去的人，也必不能老是停留在原地；至少，相对地说，必然会向后退却。
    当我们“出发”的时候，总是预定要走到一定的目的地。一定要达到目的地，也一定能达到目的地！有了明确的目标，又充满这样的信心，迈起每一步来才会健壮有力。
    一定要对于达到目的地的有利条件有足够的估计，并且有充分运用这些有利条件的技艺；也一定要对于中途可能碰到的困难有足够的估计，并且有战胜这些困难的技艺。这样，信心才不是空洞的，而是真正坚定不可动摇的。因此，当我们“出发”的时候，要全面地了解实际，要大张旗鼓宣传有利条件“以壮行色”，也要设想到可能碰到的最困难的情况。
    设想到可能碰到的最困难的情况，这决不是为了吓唬自己。什么是可能碰到的最困难的情况？不可不着边际地瞎想，把随便什么都设想为“假想敌”，弄得“草木皆兵”。在一定条件下，困难有它的最大的限度。我们所说的“最”，是指一定条件下的“最”。
    在一定条件下会发生些什么困难，达到什么程度，根据事物发生和发展的客观规律，大致是可以预计的。
    主观往往不可能完全符合客观，而只能力求接近客观；对于有些自然现象的客观规律，目前我们还不能完全掌握。因此，对于前进道路上可能发生的困难，又往往不能预计得恰恰合乎实际。
    在设想可能碰到的困难的时候，原则应当是：既不要估计过分，也不要估计不足；在还没有充分掌握客观规律的情况下，则宁可失之于有些过分，而不可失之于估计不足。——这是为了确保立于不败之地。
