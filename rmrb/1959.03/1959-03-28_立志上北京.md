    Determined to Go to Beijing
    Our Correspondent in Tianjin
    A great call to battle has captured the hearts of people on both sides of the Hai River.
      "Work harder! Achieve merit for the 18 million tons of steel, strive to go to Beijing and meet Chairman Mao!" When the announcer's voice reading the notice from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the convening of a conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the fourth quarter reached the First Steelmaking Plant of the Tianjin Steel Factory, the workers of the Qi Zisheng Steelmaking Group, who were rushing to repair the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, immediately cheered.
    The Qi Zisheng Group was a model group in Tianjin in 1958. At the beginning of this year, the group jointly developed a method of making steel with local iron. Since January, the product qualification rate has remained at 100%, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel has been shortened by about one hour. Therefore, since the Spring Festival, this group has been publicly recommended as the "pace-setter" of the entire factory. Ten days later, as a result of the competition, the output and quality indicators of the Qi Zisheng Group fell to third place, although their actual production level had not decreased compared to the past.
    "We're lagging behind!" Qi Zisheng said quietly to his two assistants.
    "We must catch up!" said assistant Yang Zhensheng.
    "How to catch up?" asked second assistant Zhou Luxiang.
    "Check our shortcomings, learn from others' advanced experience, and hold a full group meeting tomorrow. We must raise all indicators to the first place in the factory within three days!" said Qi Zisheng.
    Before three days had passed, the output indicators of the Qi Zisheng Group once again ranked among the best.
    The casting workshop of the Tianjin Tractor Factory was also seething with excitement. They discussed how to create greater achievements and strive to go to Beijing to report to Chairman Mao.
    The Tianjin Tractor Factory is currently concentrating all its efforts on producing gas and gasoline engines for farmland irrigation and drainage. As the first step in the factory's production, the casting workshop is a key department for the crash production of irrigation and drainage machinery.
    At the beginning of this year, the cylinder block casting group, under the leadership of veteran worker Feng Tianxi and with the help of technicians, manufactured a cylinder block molding machine to replace manual molding, which increased the class output by more than two-thirds.
    Today, the workers in each group of the casting workshop are even more motivated. The five groups responsible for cylinder blocks, flanges, etc., on the day shift have all overfulfilled their daily work plans. The cylinder block group cast 150 cylinder blocks, exceeding the quota by 50%.
    The workers of the Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory have been even more excited these days than usual.
    Since being selected as a labor model in 1955, Sun Guizhen has had a beautiful and happy wish – to be able to see Chairman Mao. After seeing the decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, she secretly made up her mind to realize her wish with greater production achievements.
    Sun Guizhen is a textile worker who has not produced a single defective piece of cloth for more than four consecutive years. She has consistently studied diligently and practiced hard. As long as she discovers a little bit of experience from others, she immediately adopts it. Weaver Zhao Jingdi had poor skills, slow piecing, and long machine downtime, which affected the completion of the output plan. In the first half of February, he lost 22 meters of cloth. Seeing this situation, Sun Guizhen took the initiative to sign a guarantee contract with him. With Sun Guizhen's help, Zhao Jingdi overcame his operational shortcomings, pieced faster, and by the end of February, he not only made up for the yarn lost in the first half of the month but also overfulfilled the monthly plan by 85 meters.
    Recently, Sun Guizhen has put forward new guarantees: while overfulfilling the output plan this year, she will also summarize a relatively systematic set of operational experiences suitable for the high-speed operation of weaving machines based on her own experience and contract with the workshop.

    立志上北京
    本报驻天津记者
    一个伟大的战斗号召，吸引了海河两岸人们的心。
      “加油干哪！为一千八百万吨钢立功，争取上北京，去见毛主席！”当播音员朗读着中共中央和国务院关于第四季度召开先进集体、先进生产者会议通知的声音传到了天津钢厂第一炼钢厂的时候，正在抢修一号平炉的齐子升炼钢小组的工人们立即这样欢呼起来。
    齐子升小组是天津市1958年的模范小组，这个小组，今年年初共同研究出一套用土铁炼钢的办法，从1月份以来产品的合格率一直保持百分之百，每炉钢的熔炼时间也缩短了一小时左右，因此这个小组从春节以后就被公推为全厂的“标兵”。十天以后，竞赛的结果，齐子升小组的产量和质量指标下降到第三名，虽然他们的实际生产水平比过去没有降低。
    “咱们落后啦”！齐子升悄悄地对他的两个助手说。
    “要迎头赶上！”一助手杨振声说。
    “怎么赶？”二助手周禄祥问。
    “检查我们的缺点，学习人家的先进经验，明天就开全组会议，一定要在三天以内把一切指标上升到全厂第一名！”齐子升说。
    未出三天，果然齐子升小组的产量指标再次地名列前茅。
    天津拖拉机制造厂铸工车间也沸腾起来了。他们谈论如何创造出更大的成绩，争取上北京向毛主席汇报的问题。
    天津拖拉机制造厂目前正集中全力生产农田排灌用的煤气和汽油机，作为工厂生产第一步的铸工车间，是突击生产排灌机械的关键部门。
    今年年初，浇铸汽缸体小组，在老工人冯天锡的领导下，得到技术人员的帮助，制造出汽缸体的造型机，代替了人工造型，使班产量提高了三分之二以上。
    今天，铸工车间各小组工人的干劲更足，上白班的汽缸体、法兰盘等五个小组都超额完成了当日作业计划。汽缸体小组浇铸了一百五十个汽缸体，超过定额50％。
    天津第二棉纺织厂的职工，这几天比往日更为兴奋。
    孙桂珍从1955年开始被选为劳动模范以后，就有一个美好幸福的愿望——能够见到毛主席。当她看到中共中央和国务院的决定以后，她心里暗暗下定决心，要用更大的生产成绩来实现她的愿望。
    孙桂珍是连续四年多没出过次布的纺织女工，她一贯苦学勤练，只要发现别人有点滴的经验，她就立即采纳。织布工赵景弟技术差，接头慢，机器停车的时间长，影响产量计划的完成，2月份前半个月就亏了二十二公尺布。孙桂珍看到这个情况，主动和他订了保教合同。在孙桂珍的帮助下，赵景弟克服了操作上的缺陷，接头快了，到2月底不但补上前半个月亏的纱，还超额八十五公尺完成月计划。
    最近，孙桂珍又提出了新的保证条件：在今年超额完成产量计划的同时，还要根据自己的经验，合同车间总结出一套比较系统的适合织布机高速运转的操作经验。
