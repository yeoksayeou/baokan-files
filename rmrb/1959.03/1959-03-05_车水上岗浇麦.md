Waterwheels to Higher Ground for Wheat Irrigation

The western part of Guicun People's Commune in Xuchang County, Henan Province, is a hilly area where digging wells is impossible and opening canals is unfeasible, making it historically arid land. However, in the recent spring wheat irrigation campaign, commune members have been trying every possible means to turn the highlands into plains and bring water to the highlands for wheat irrigation.

Zhang Mingde, Niu Changqing, and other commune members living on Wolf Tooth Ridge, after conducting on-site surveys, believed that by using the accumulated water in the dry gullies and lifting it in three stages, water could reach Wolf Tooth Ridge. This would not only allow the wheat on the ridge to be irrigated with returning green water in a timely manner but also thoroughly and well. That night, eight of them, taking advantage of the moonlight, dug mud and opened canals.

Zhang Mingde is an ordinary commune member in his forties, with a robust physique and consistently active in production. In this labor of digging canals to bring water to the ridge, he demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. In the cold night of two degrees below zero, he stood in the water and dug a five-meter-long irrigation channel in one go. Under his influence, everyone fought for two days, opening and repairing five waterways and five river wells. Then, using waterwheels, they pumped water from the four-to-five-zhang-deep riverbeds up to the ridge, flowing into the green wheat fields.

The water reaching Wolf Tooth Ridge greatly encouraged the people on the ridge. Women's team leader Yang Puni led more than forty women to push waterwheels. Each waterwheel irrigated four mu of land per day. An old man named Niu Fengzhao, seeing that water could now be brought to the ridge for wheat irrigation, said with emotion, "Thousand-year-old dry gullies have become rivers, and barren old ridges have become plains."

    车水上岗浇麦
    河南许昌县桂村人民公社的西半部，是丘岭地区，挖井不成，开渠不通，历来是块旱地。但是，在最近开展的小麦春浇运动中，社员们却千方百计地想办法，决心要把岗地当平川，引水上岗浇麦。
    住在狼牙岗上的社员张明德和牛长庆等人，经过实地勘测，认为利用干沟里积存的水，通过三层提引，水就可以上狼牙岗。这不但使岗上的小麦能及时浇灌返青水，还能浇透、浇好。当晚，他们八个人，就趁着月光挖泥开渠。
    张明德是一个四十多岁的普通社员。体格结实，生产一贯积极。在这次挖渠引水上岗的劳动中，发挥了冲天的干劲。在零下二度的寒夜里，他置身水中，一股劲挖成一条一丈五尺长的引水道。在他的影响下，大家奋战了两天，开挖和整修了五条水道、五眼河井。然后用水车，从四、五丈深的河槽里，把水抽上岗来，流进青绿的麦田里。
    水上了狼牙岗，大大地鼓舞了岗上人们的干劲。妇女队长杨朴妮，率领四十多个妇女推水车。她们每部水车日浇四亩田。有一个叫牛风照的老大爷，看到如今能引水上岗浇麦，颇有感慨地说：“千年的干沟变成河，荒山老岗变平川。”
