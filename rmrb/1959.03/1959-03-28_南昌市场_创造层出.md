Nanchang Market
	Innovations Emerge
	Automatic vending machine for quick change
	The Nanchang Department Store No. 1 successfully trial-produced an automatic vending machine. Customers only need to put money into a special container, and cigarettes and candies will automatically jump out of it.
	This department store also created a quick change dispenser. When the clerk turns on the switch, the change needed for the customer will fall out of the cash box.
	Automated Packaging
	The Nanchang Department Store successfully trial-produced an automatic packaging machine. It can package various cakes and pastries, reducing a lot of trouble for salespersons.
	Instantly Know Shoe and Sock Size
	Customers buying shoes and socks are always worried about the size not being suitable, and often try them on repeatedly, causing a lot of trouble. Employees of Nanchang Department Store No. 1 trial-produced an electric shoe and sock tester. With one try, the shoe and sock size will be known.
	Goods Go Straight to the Fourth Floor
	In order to solve the heavy manual labor of carrying goods up to the third and fourth floors, employees of the Nanchang Department Store installed a freight elevator, which can easily send goods to the fourth floor.
	Photographer's Creations
	The He Ji Photo Studio in Nanchang City created amazing miracles in technical innovation. The affiliated "Photographic Equipment Repair Shop," composed of four photographers and three apprentices, used simple tools and some waste materials to produce more than 20 types of equipment, including automatic cameras, AC/DC electric rotary machines, automatic printing machines, photographic electronic timers, microscope cameras, large copper plate reproduction machines, and X-ray cameras. This not only solved the problem of photographic equipment for themselves, but also accepted orders from hospitals, printing plants, and exploration departments.
	Electric Food Delivery and Menu Transmission
	The electric food delivery device created by the Xin Ya Tong Restaurant in Nanchang City can deliver dishes directly to the dining room. The electric menu transmission device can send the menu to the kitchen, greatly shortening the customers' dining time.
	Automatic Dishwashing and High-Speed Rice Steaming
	The Nanchang Dongfanghong Restaurant produced electric meat grinders, electric dough mixers, electric grinders, and automatic dishwashers. They also promoted universal steaming racks and high-speed steam rice cookers, which not only sped up the work but also saved a lot of labor.
