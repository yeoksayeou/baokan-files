Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Master Xi Rao Jia Cuo, President of the Chinese Buddhist Association, made a statement to reporters on the Tibet issue, saying: "Due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page in the history of Tibet is being opened. This is a great thing for the broad masses of the Tibetan people."

The seventy-six-year-old Master Xi Rao Jia Cuo went to Lhasa to study Buddhist academics from the age of twenty-one until he left there at the age of fifty-three. He has deep feelings for Tibet. Tonight, when he met with reporters, he said at the beginning: "The Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, gathering rebel bandits, and carrying out armed rebellion, is the most abominable thing. They violated the will of the Tibetan people, betrayed the motherland, and also betrayed Buddhist precepts, which cannot be tolerated by national law and religious rules."

Xi Rao Jia Cuo is a representative of the National People's Congress. He said that he had hoped to meet with the Dalai Lama at the first session of the Second National People's Congress in April, but the Tibetan reactionaries abducted the Dalai Lama from Lhasa, which made him feel very sad.

Xi Rao Jia Cuo said: "Since liberation, the Party Central Committee and the Central Government have consistently implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in Tibet, done countless good things, and vigorously supported Tibet in terms of material and financial resources, benefiting the Tibetan people, and have been warmly supported and sincerely loved by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. The Central Government has done its utmost to maintain national unity and ethnic solidarity, but the Tibetan reactionaries have repaid kindness with enmity and openly launched a rebellion. When the Central Government had no choice but to suppress the rebellion, it announced the protection of the lives and property of the Tibetan people, respecting the people's customs and religious beliefs, and protecting Lama temples and cultural relics…"

Speaking of this, Master Xi Rao Jia Cuo said with great emotion: "This policy of the Central Government is both correct and wise, and fully conforms to the interests of the Tibetan people." He also said: "As a Tibetan and as a Buddhist, I fully support the measures taken by the Central Government to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion. Only by quelling the rebellion can the Tibetan people have a peaceful and happy life."

Xi Rao Jia Cuo told reporters: "I am Tibetan and have lived in Tibet for many years. I understand the enlightened people and the broad masses of people there. The Party and the Central Government are benefiting them, and they support and love the Party and the Central Government. The upper-level reactionary clique launched a rebellion, violating their interests, so they support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion. I believe that with their full support, the Tibetan rebellion will be quickly suppressed."

When the reporter told him that the US State Department had slandered our suppression of the rebellion as "depriving religious autonomy," the master said angrily: "This is a shameless rumor and incitement by the imperialists, and it will be completely shattered in the face of the facts." He said: "As the president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, I have the right to speak: The Chinese people have complete freedom of religious belief, and our government has always implemented a policy of protecting religion. The Tibetan rebels are jackals in Buddhist robes. They not only violate national law, but also violate Buddhist precepts. Quelling the rebellion not only safeguards national law, but also safeguards Buddhist precepts."

    中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错发表谈话
    西藏叛乱分子是披着佛教外衣的豺狼
    新华社29日讯　中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错大师就西藏问题向记者发表谈话说：“由于西藏反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的失败，西藏的历史正在揭开新的一页。这对西藏广大人民来说是一件大好的事情。”
    七十六岁的喜饶嘉错大师，从二十一岁起就到拉萨研究佛教学术，直到五十三岁才离开那里，他对西藏有着深厚的感情。今天晚间他在会见记者时一开始就说：“西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义，纠集叛匪，进行武装叛乱，是一件最可恶的事情。他们违反了西藏人民的意志，背叛了祖国，也背叛了佛教教规，为国法和教规所不能容。”
    喜饶嘉错是全国人民代表大会的代表，他说，他曾经希望4月间在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上同达赖喇嘛会见，但是，西藏的反动分子却将达赖喇嘛劫出拉萨，这使他感到非常痛心。
    喜饶嘉错说：“解放以后，党中央和中央政府在西藏一贯执行和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，做了数不尽的好事情，在物力和财力上大力支援西藏，为西藏人民造福，受到西藏广大人民的热烈拥护和真诚爱戴。中央为维护国家统一和民族团结已仁至义尽，西藏的反动分子却恩将仇报，公然发动叛乱，中央在不得不进行平乱的时候，又宣布保护西藏人民的生命财产，尊重人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，保护喇嘛寺庙和文物古迹……。”
    谈到这里，喜饶嘉错大师极为感动地说：“中央政府这一方针既正确又英明，完全符合西藏人民的利益。”他又说：“作为一个藏族人，作为一个佛教徒，我完全拥护中央采取的彻底平息西藏叛乱和解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的措施。只有平息了叛乱，西藏人民才会有安宁和幸福的生活。”
    喜饶嘉错对记者说：“我是藏族，又在西藏住了许多年，我了解那里的上层开明人士和广大人民，党和中央政府为他们造福，他们拥护和爱戴党和中央政府，上层反动集团发动叛乱，违反了他们的利益，所以他们拥护中央政府进行平乱，我相信，在他们的全力支持下，西藏的叛乱一定会被迅速扑灭。”
    当记者告诉他美国国务院诬蔑我们平乱是“剥夺宗教自治”的时候，这位大师愤愤地说：“这是帝国主义者无耻的造谣和挑拨离间，它将要在事实面前被彻底粉碎。”他说：“作为中国佛教协会会长我有权发言：中国人民完全有宗教信仰的自由，我们的政府一贯执行保护宗教的政策。西藏叛乱分子是披着佛教外衣的豺狼，他们不仅违反国法，而且违反佛教教规，平息叛乱不仅维护了国法，而且维护了佛教教规。”
