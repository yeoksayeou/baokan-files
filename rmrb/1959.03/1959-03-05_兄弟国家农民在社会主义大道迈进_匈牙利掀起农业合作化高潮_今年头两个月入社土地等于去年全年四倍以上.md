Brotherly Countries' Peasants Advance on the Socialist Road
Hungary Launches High Tide of Agricultural Cooperativization
Land Enrolled in Cooperatives in the First Two Months of This Year Equals More Than Four Times the Total for the Entire Last Year

Budapest, March 4th (Reported by this newspaper) Since the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party formulated the resolution on further developing agricultural production cooperativization last December, the socialist transformation of agriculture has achieved great success in January and February this year. The call to accelerate the pace towards socialist collective management has spread across the vast countryside like spring thunder. More and more peasants are joining cooperatives every day. New agricultural production cooperatives and cooperative villages are constantly emerging.

In Győr-Sopron County, 30,000 farm households have joined cooperatives with 295,000 holds of land. Out of the 176 villages in the county, 172 have become cooperativized villages. Adding the land of state-owned farms, more than 97% of the land in the county has implemented large-scale collective management. As of December 31st last year, only 4,125 farm households had joined cooperatives in this county, with only 51,000 holds of land enrolled.

In Veszprém County, 25,000 farm households have joined cooperatives with 200,000 holds of land, resulting in 157 cooperativized villages. Land belonging to cooperatives and state-owned farms accounts for about 95%.

In Szolnok County, a total of 33,000 farm households have embarked on the road of collective management. The land enrolled in cooperatives amounts to 200,000 holds, with land belonging to cooperatives and state-owned farms accounting for over 93%.

In Vas, Komárom, Somogy, and Fejér counties, nearly 8,000 farm households have joined agricultural production cooperatives respectively; other counties have also seen certain development.

Although the development of the cooperativization movement is not balanced across all states, from the Mátra Mountains to the shores of Lake Balaton, from the Tisza River basin to the banks of the Danube River, a surge in the cooperativization movement has been set off everywhere.

The development of cooperatives is accelerating. In terms of the area of land enrolled in cooperatives, if the land enrolled increased by more than 250,000 holds last year, then the land enrolled in January this year reached 180,000 holds. The first half of February also exceeded 180,000 holds, and from February 15th to 26th, nearly 750,000 holds of land were enrolled. (Attached photo)

    兄弟国家农民在社会主义大道迈进
    匈牙利掀起农业合作化高潮
    今年头两个月入社土地等于去年全年四倍以上
    本报布达佩斯4日电　自从去年12月匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会制定了进一步发展农业生产合作化的决议之后，今年1、2月农业的社会主义改造取得了很大的成绩。加速步伐走向社会主义集体经营的号召，像春雷一般传遍了广大的农村。参加合作社的农民一天比一天多起来。新的农业生产合作社和合作社村庄不断的出现。
    吉厄尔—索普伦州已有三万农户，带着二十九万五千霍尔特土地入了社。全州共有一百七十六个村庄，已有一百七十二个变成了合作化村。加上国营农场的土地，这个州97％以上的土地，已经实行大规模的集体经营了。而到去年12月31日为止，这个州入社的农民只有四千一百二十五户，入社的土地只有五万一千霍尔特。
    维斯普雷姆州已有两万五千农户，带着二十万霍尔特土地入了社，出现了一百五十七个合作化村庄，合作社和国营农场的土地占95％左右。
    索尔诺克州共有三万三千农户走上了集体经营的道路。入社的土地达二十万霍尔特，合作社和国营农场的土地占93％以上。
    沃什、科马罗姆、绍莫吉、费叶尔等州，也已经各有近八千农户加入了农业生产合作社；其他各州也都有了一定的发展。
    虽然全国各州合作化运动的发展不够平衡，但是从马特拉山到巴拉敦湖畔，从蒂萨河流域到多瑙河的两岸，到处都掀起了合作化运动的热潮。
    合作社的发展是加速度的。就入社的土地面积来讲，如果去年一年入社的土地增加了二十五万多霍尔特，那么今年1月份入社的土地就达到十八万霍尔特，2月份上半个月也超过了十八万霍尔特，而从2月15日到26日，入社的土地就将近七十五万霍尔特。（附图片）
