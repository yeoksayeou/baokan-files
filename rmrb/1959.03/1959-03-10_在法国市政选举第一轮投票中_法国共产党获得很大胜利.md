Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 9th: Preliminary results from the first round of French municipal elections held yesterday show a significant increase in votes for the French Communist Party, which has regained or expanded its positions in many areas.  Meanwhile, Charles de Gaulle's "Union for the New Republic" suffered a clear decline in votes and a series of setbacks.

In Paris and twelve major cities, the Communist Party achieved enormous victories in the elections without exception. In Paris, the Communist Party won twenty-nine seats on the Municipal Council (30% of the total seats), once again becoming the largest party. The "Union for the New Republic" won only twenty-three seats, and the Independent Party nineteen. According to preliminary results, the French Communist Party received 327,458 votes in Paris, more than 20,000 more than in the first round of elections in November last year. The "Union for the New Republic," however, saw its votes decrease from 300,000 to 235,000.

The voting situation in the other twelve major cities was largely the same. The Communist Party won one hundred and thirty-one seats and 25% of the vote in these major cities. The "Union for the New Republic" won only one hundred and eighteen seats, the Independent Party fifty-six seats, and the Socialist Party seventy-seven seats.

The popularity of the French Communist Party is evident. For example, Georges Marrane was re-elected as a city councilor in Ivry with 72% of the vote, nearly 3,500 more votes than in the election on November 23 last year. In Le Havre, the French Communist Party received 8,000 more votes than in the November 23 election, 1,000 more votes in Strasbourg, and 20,000 more votes in Marseille.

    在法国市政选举第一轮投票中
    法国共产党获得很大胜利
    据新华社巴黎9日电　昨天举行的法国市政选举第一轮投票的初步结果表明，法国共产党得票显著增加，在许多地方夺回或者扩大了自己的阵地。而戴高乐的“保卫新共和联盟”所得票数却明显下降，遭到一连串的挫折。
    在巴黎和十二个大城市里，共产党在选举中都毫无例外地获得了巨大的胜利。在巴黎，共产党赢得了市政委员会的二十九个席位（占总席位30％），再次成为第一大党。“保卫新共和联盟”只赢得二十三个席位，独立党十九席。根据初步结果，法国共产党在巴黎所获得的票数是三十二万七千四百五十八张，比去年11月选举第一轮投票时的票数多两万多张。“保卫新共和联盟”所得票数却从三十万张减至二十三万五千张。
    其它十二个大城市的投票情况也大致相同。共产党在这些大城市中获得了一百三十一个席位、25％的选票。“保卫新共和联盟”只获得一百一十八个席位、独立党五十六个席位、社会党七十七个席位。
    法国共产党深得人心的情况是很明显的。例如乔治·马兰以获得72％的选票被重选为伊符里的市议员，比去年11月23日选举时多得了近三千五百票。在哈佛尔，法国共产党比11月23日选举时多得了八千票，在斯特拉斯堡多得了一千票，在马赛多得两万票。
