Mountain beyond mountain, tower beyond tower, pines and cypresses ever green, waters ever flowing, you build reservoirs, I plant trees, constructing tall buildings amidst a sea of flowers.
	Tall buildings pierce the ninth layer of heaven, clouds hang at the doorway, stand on the top of the building and take a look, never enough looking left and right.

Mountain beyond mountain, tower beyond tower, heroes swing their iron fists, shouting loudly "Here I come!" gold and silver mountains bow their heads.
	Gold and silver mountains open their gates, golden foals and silver foals come down the mountain, raise our eyebrows and wave our hands, treasures follow us.

Mountain beyond mountain, tower beyond tower, young men and women dance with red silk ribbons, the Yangko dance twists towards the clouds, red flags sweep over the treetops.
	Thousands of cities and tens of thousands of communes drink joyful wine, drums and gongs fill the sky celebrating the harvest, with enough to eat and wear, hearts blossom, no more worries or sorrows.

Mountain beyond mountain, tower beyond tower, a boundless journey lies ahead, I sweat more for the motherland, I strive for the upstream for the motherland.
	Stride forward and swing our arms, march forward heroically, want to know how good the future is? Tomorrow's landscape will be even more splendid!

    山外青山楼外楼（歌词）
    放平
    一山外青山楼外楼，松柏长青水长流，你修水库我种树，万花丛中盖高楼。高楼插入重霄九，云彩挂在大门口，站到楼顶看一看，左看右看看不够。二山外青山楼外楼，英雄抡起铁拳头，大喊一声“我来了！”金山银山低下头。金山银山把门开，金驹银驹下山来，扬扬眉毛挥挥手，宝贝跟着我们走。三山外青山楼外楼，少男少女舞红绸，秧歌扭向云中去，红旗卷过树梢头。千城万社喝喜酒，锣鼓喧天庆丰收，有吃有穿心花放，再也不用担忧愁。四山外青山楼外楼，万里鹏程在前头，我为祖国多流汗，我为祖国争上游。迈开大步甩开手，高歌猛进雄赳赳，要问前程有多好？明日江山更风流！
