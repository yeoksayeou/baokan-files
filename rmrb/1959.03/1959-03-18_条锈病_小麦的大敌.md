Stripe Rust – A Major Enemy of Wheat
Northwest Agricultural College Professor Sun Wanxiang, Associate Professor Qiu Yuan, Li Jianyi

Editor's Note: Last winter's warmer temperatures and this spring's early and abundant rains, coupled with increased fertilization and irrigation of wheat, have created conditions conducive to rust diseases. Currently, rust has been detected in the North China region and in provinces such as Shaanxi. To assist various regions in strengthening rust prevention and control efforts, we are publishing the following article for reference.

Wheat stripe rust is also known as "yellow jaundice" or yellow rust. It is the biggest enemy of wheat production in Shaanxi Province. It occurred frequently before liberation, causing severe losses. After liberation, the promotion of superior rust-resistant varieties such as Bima No. 1 and No. 6028 effectively controlled its damage. However, as the rust resistance of Bima No. 1 gradually diminished, stripe rust re-emerged in 1957 and 1958. The Shaanxi Provincial Party and government leadership attached great importance to this issue and recently called for a second battle against stripe rust to eliminate it completely. Under the correct leadership of the Party, implemented step by step, victory will surely be achieved.

Mastering the Patterns of Rust Disease Occurrence and Development

Wheat rust diseases include three types: stripe rust (also known as yellow rust), leaf rust (also known as brown rust), and stem rust (also known as black rust), generally collectively referred to as jaundice. Stripe rust mainly occurs on leaves, but can also occur on leaf sheaths, stems, and glumes; leaf rust mainly occurs on leaves; stem rust mainly occurs on stems. Wheat rust diseases are widely distributed in China, with stripe rust being the most serious threat to winter wheat. Rust is a parasitic infectious disease. Mastering the biological characteristics of the pathogens and the patterns of disease occurrence and development is key to completely eliminating it. This has already led to many glorious achievements in humanity's fight against plagues.

The occurrence and development of stripe rust is a process of struggle between wheat and rust fungi under certain environmental conditions. The earliness and severity of stripe rust depend on the host, the pathogen, and environmental conditions. Without susceptible hosts or pathogens, the disease will not occur; without favorable environmental conditions, even with pathogens and susceptible hosts, the disease will not develop. Environmental conditions can cause changes in both the host and the pathogen, the two conflicting sides.

Wheat stripe rust is an infectious disease spread by air currents. The blister-like small yellow spots that appear on the leaves of diseased wheat plants are called uredinia. The yellow powder that scatters when the uredinia rupture are the seeds of the rust fungus, called urediniospores. Urediniospores are very small and can be blown by the wind to various places, even very far away. If they land on susceptible wheat leaves with saturated atmospheric humidity or a film of water or water droplets on the leaf surface, they can germinate and invade the inside of the leaf through the stomata, absorbing wheat's moisture to grow and develop. Under suitable infection and development temperatures (9 to 16 degrees Celsius), new uredinia and urediniospores are produced in eight to twelve days, which are then spread by the wind and infect other plants. One uredinium can produce approximately two thousand urediniospores at a time, and continue to produce them several times; one urediniospore can produce hundreds of uredinia after invasion, showing that stripe rust fungi reproduce quickly and the spore count is very high. Therefore, when environmental conditions are suitable, it can become a serious epidemic in a short period of time. Precisely because of this, it is imperative to treat early, treat small, and treat thoroughly. However, if the temperature is not suitable, the growth and development of the fungi will be slow, and the incubation period of the disease will be prolonged. If the weather is dry and there is no moisture on the leaf surface, urediniospores cannot germinate and therefore cannot infect. Generally, rust disease is favored by rainy, dewy, foggy, and high soil moisture conditions.

Improper Fertilization, Irrigation, and Planting Time Can Lead to Disease

Environmental conditions not only affect the infection and development of stripe rust fungi, but also affect the growth and development of wheat and its disease resistance. For example, excessive humidity makes wheat prone to lodging and more susceptible to disease. Furthermore, fertilizer has a significant impact on wheat's disease resistance. An imbalance in the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, especially in the case of excessive nitrogen fertilizer, increases wheat's susceptibility to disease, leading to more severe outbreaks. Sufficient phosphorus and potassium fertilizer can improve wheat's resistance to stripe rust, resulting in milder outbreaks. Therefore, both fertilization and irrigation can influence the extent of rust epidemics.

All stages of wheat growth and all above-ground parts can be infected by stripe rust fungi. Therefore, stripe rust can sometimes be found in the field as early as half a month after wheat emergence. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, the earlier the wheat is sown, the longer it is exposed to the disease, the larger the area affected, the more times it is infected, and the more severe the outbreak. The results of a survey in early December 1958 fully illustrated this point. At that time, wheat fields generally sown before mid-October were already infected and had centers of disease; while those sown after mid-October rarely showed signs of disease.

After autumn seedlings are infected, the rust fungi plunder nutrients, interfere with wheat's physiology, and cause reactions in the wheat, leading to the consumption of nutrients, especially carbohydrates. Furthermore, the numerous uredinia on the leaf surface cause the epidermis to rupture, losing control over water evaporation. At the same time, the area for photosynthesis is reduced, and the amount of nutrients synthesized is small. As a result, diseased seedlings have poor resistance to cold and drought. Therefore, diseased leaves, especially severely diseased leaves, wither during the winter. Because rust fungi are purely parasitic, the fungi cannot continue to grow and reproduce after the diseased leaves wither and quickly die along with them. Therefore, severe winter cold can kill a large number of fungi, reducing the source of overwintering inoculum. Conversely, if the winter is warm, it creates favorable conditions for the fungi to overwinter. Precisely because stripe rust fungi are purely parasitic and spread by air currents, we have designed control methods such as burying soil and cutting leaves, and applying ammonium sulfate to kill diseased leaves and pathogens to eliminate disease centers.

This Year's Temperature and Rainfall are Conducive to Rust Disease

Based on the basic patterns of wheat stripe rust occurrence and development, we can estimate the potential situation for stripe rust this year. Taking the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi as an example, wheat was generally sown earlier last autumn, temperatures were low before and after sowing, the severe winter arrived late, and there was abundant rain and heavy dew in autumn and winter. These are all conditions conducive to the occurrence and development of stripe rust. In addition, the large-scale occurrence of inoculum in the autumn seedling areas of Pingliang and Changwu created a relatively widespread and severe outbreak in the autumn seedlings of 1958. For example, in Qishan, a survey of a hundred mu of early-sown wheat fields on December 9th last year showed that the rate of infected plants had reached 80%–100%. This severe situation is unprecedented since liberation.

Even more noteworthy is the warmer climate last winter and the early and abundant rains this spring. This is conducive to the overwintering of stripe rust fungi and may lead to continuous infection. As temperatures gradually rise, it becomes even more favorable for rust fungi to invade and grow; coupled with the early and abundant spring rains, stripe rust is likely to occur earlier and be more epidemic this year than last year. Freshly ruptured uredinia have been found in some areas. Therefore, if we do not vigorously carry out prevention and control, the damage from stripe rust this year may be more severe than in 1957 and 1958. Seize the Opportunity During the Regreening Stage to Completely Eliminate It

Stripe rust fungi overwinter in slightly diseased, non-withered leaves or in leaves that are infected but do not show symptoms, becoming the source of spring infection. When spring comes, the weather warms, and wheat seedlings regreen and begin to joint, the latent fungi also begin to activate, grow, reproduce, and reinfect. Although stripe rust fungi are spread by air currents and spores can be blown by the wind to distant regions, the opportunity for nearby plants to be infected is always greater. Therefore, as the fungi reproduce generation after generation, single diseased leaves develop into disease centers, which gradually expand and spread throughout the entire field. As temperatures rise in the spring, the incubation period becomes shorter, and the fungi reproduce faster. Therefore, during the rainy months of April and May, outbreaks often occur, covering the leaf surface with yellow powder. Diseased leaves are prone to curling, withering, and dying, resulting in insufficient grain filling and shriveled or unfulfilled kernels. The earlier the spring is warm and rainy, the earlier the disease occurs, and the greater the loss to wheat. If a severe epidemic occurs during the booting stage, it may become "locked jaundice," meaning the ears cannot emerge, resulting in no grain harvest. Therefore, we must implement the spirit of treating early, treating small, and treating thoroughly, seize the opportunity during the wheat regreening stage, and completely eliminate stripe rust. Otherwise, if the fungi get past this stage, subsequent prevention and control will not only be labor-intensive and costly, but the plants will be dense, making operation difficult, and the wheat will have already suffered yield losses that cannot be compensated for.

Stripe rust fungi thrive in shady and cool climates and are intolerant to high temperatures. Therefore, they cannot survive the summer in plains areas. However, in high mountain and plateau regions above 2,000 meters, stripe rust fungi can parasitize and overwinter in these regions due to the lower summer temperatures. In the spring, urediniospores of stripe rust fungi in the plains gradually spread by wind to plateau or high mountain regions, parasitizing and damaging spring wheat or wild spring seedlings, and reproduce over the summer. In the autumn, they are gradually spread by wind from plateau and high mountain regions to the winter wheat areas of the plains, infecting autumn wheat seedlings and overwintering in winter wheat areas. This cycle repeats itself, completing the overwintering and oversummering infection cycle. Based on the overwintering and oversummering patterns of stripe rust fungi in Shaanxi Province, we can derive the following insights: (1) If we can break the overwintering and oversummering chain of stripe rust fungi, we can completely eliminate stripe rust. (2) The epidemic of stripe rust in Guanzhong is mainly due to the gradual reproduction, accumulation, and spread of fungi on local autumn seedlings after overwintering. Therefore, if we completely eliminate the fungi on autumn seedlings or completely eliminate the source of inoculum after overwintering in early spring, we can effectively prevent the epidemic of stripe rust. This further illustrates why we emphasize strictly guarding the winter threshold and the need to eliminate stripe rust fungi during the wheat regreening stage.

    条锈病——小麦的大敌
    西北农学院教授　孙万祥　仇元		副教授　李建义
    编者按　去冬气温较暖，今春雨早量大，加之小麦施肥多，灌水足，这些条件均适于锈病发生。目前，华北地区和陕西等省已经发现锈病。为帮助各地加强锈病防治工作，特发表以下文章供参考。
    小麦条锈病就是“黄疸病”，又叫黄锈病。这是陕西省小麦生产上最大的敌人，解放前经常发生，造成严重的损失。解放后由于推广了碧蚂一号及6028号等优良抗锈品种，曾经有效的控制了它的为害。但当抗锈能力较强的碧蚂一号逐渐丧失其抗锈特性后，1957年和1958年条锈病又连续发生。陕西省党政领导部门对这个问题非常重视，最近号召向条锈病展开第二次战役，彻底消灭条锈病。在党的正确领导下，一环套一环的贯彻下去，一定会取得胜利。
    掌握锈病发生发展的规律
    小麦锈病有三种：条锈病（又称黄锈病）、叶锈病（又称褐锈病）、秆锈病（又称黑锈病），一般笼统地都称为黄疸。条锈病主要发生在叶上，但叶鞘、茎及颖也都能发生；叶锈病主要发生在叶上；秆锈病主要发生在秆上。小麦锈病在我国分布很广，尤以条锈病对冬小麦为害最严重。锈病是一种寄生性的传染病。掌握传染病的病原生物学特性和病害的发生发展规律，便可以彻底地消灭它。这在人类向瘟疫作斗争中已经有了不少的辉煌成就。
    条锈病的发生发展是小麦和锈病菌在一定环境条件下的斗争过程。条锈病发生的迟早和严重程度是决定于寄主、病原和环境条件。没有感病的寄主或病菌，病害当然不会发生；没有利于发病的环境条件，纵然有病菌和感病寄主也是不会发病的。环境条件是可以使寄主和病原矛盾的双方发生变化的。
    小麦条锈病是一种气流传布的侵染性病害。小麦生病后在叶片等处所生的泡状的小黄点，叫做夏孢子堆，夏孢子堆破裂后散出的黄粉即是锈菌的种子，称为夏孢子。夏孢子很小，可以被风吹向各处甚至很远的地方。落在感病的麦叶上，如果有饱和的大气湿度或叶面有水膜或水滴，它就可以发芽，由气孔侵入叶子内部，吸取小麦的水分而生长发育。在适宜的侵染发育温度下（九至十六度），经过八至十二天，便产生新的夏孢子堆和夏孢子，再行随风传布，并侵染其他植株。一个夏孢子堆一次约可产生二千个夏孢子，并连续产生若干次；一个夏孢子侵入后可以产生成百的夏孢子堆，可知条锈病菌繁殖很快而且孢子量很大。所以环境条件适宜时，它在短期内可以成为严重的流行病。正因其如此，所以必须治早治少治了。但是如果温度不适宜，病菌的生长发育缓慢，病害的潜育期便会延长些。如果天气干旱，叶面没有水分，夏孢子不能发芽，当然也就不能侵染。一般系在多雨、有露、有雾和土壤湿度大时有利于锈病的发生。
    施肥、灌溉、播种期不当容易受病
    环境条件不仅影响条锈病菌的侵染和发育，同时也影响小麦的生长发育和它的抗病性。例如湿度过大，小麦徒长时愈易受病。又如肥料对小麦抗病性的影响颇大，氮磷钾三要素配合不当，在氮肥过量的情况下，也增进了小麦感病性，发病较重；而磷钾肥充足时，可提高小麦对条锈病的抵抗性，发病较轻。因此施肥与灌溉都可影响锈病的流行程度。
    小麦生长各阶段和地上各部分都可被条锈病菌侵染，因此有时在小麦出土后半月即可在田间找到条锈病。在陕西省关中地区播种愈早的小麦，则受病的时间愈长、面积愈大、受侵染的次数愈多，发病亦愈重。1958年12月初调查结果充分说明了这一点。当时一般在10月中旬以前播种的麦田均已发病，并有传病中心；而10月中旬以后播种的，则极少发病。
    秋苗受病后，一方面由于锈菌的掠夺和对小麦生理的干扰以及小麦对病菌的反应，导致养料尤其碳水化合物的消耗；另一方面由于叶面产生许多孢子堆，表皮破裂，失去对水分蒸发的控制机能，同时光合作用的面积减小，营养物质合成量少，因而病苗耐寒耐旱力较差，所以病叶尤其是重病叶片经冬天都枯死。由于锈菌是纯寄生性的，病叶枯死后病菌亦不能继续生长繁殖而迅速随之死亡。因此，冬季严寒可以杀死大量病菌，减少了越冬菌源。相反的，如果冬季温暖，则造成病菌越冬有利条件。正因为条锈病菌是纯寄生性的和气流传布的，所以设计了埋土切叶的防治办法和应用硫酸铵等杀伤病叶与病原菌以消灭传病中心的方法。
    今年气温雨量适于锈病发生
    根据小麦条锈病发生发展的基本规律，我们可以估计一下今年条锈病可能发生的情况。以陕西关中地区为例，去秋小麦一般播种较早，播种前后温度较低，而严冬来得却迟，秋冬又是雨多露重。这都是利于条锈病发生发展的条件，加以去秋早播冬麦区平凉长武一带大量发生菌源，便造成了1958年秋苗较为普遍而严重的发病情况。如岐山有百亩早播麦田，于去年12月9日调查时，发病株率已达80％—100％，这种严重情况是解放以来历年所未有的。
    更可注意的是去冬气候较暖和今春雨早量大。这是有利于条锈病菌越冬的，而且可能进行不断的侵染。今后温度逐渐升高，更有利于锈菌侵入和生长；加以春雨早而量大，所以今年条锈病比去年要发生得早，流行为害的可能性也更大。在某些地区已发现新鲜破裂的夏孢子堆，因此如不大力进行防治，则今年条锈病的为害可能比1957年、1958年严重。抓紧返青关彻底消灭
    条锈病菌是在受病轻微未枯死的叶片或侵染而未表现症状的叶子里越冬，成为春季传染根源。春来转暖，麦苗返青拔节时，潜藏的病菌亦开始活动，生长繁殖再行传染。条锈病菌虽然是气流传布，孢子可随风吹至遥远的地区，但附近植株受传染的机会总是比较多。所以随着病菌逐代繁殖，由单病叶片发展为传病中心，再逐渐扩大而及全田普遍发生。春季随着温度上升，潜育期愈短，病菌繁殖越快，故4、5月间多雨，常可爆发流行，叶面布满黄粉，病叶易于卷缩枯死，因而灌浆不足，麦粒瘪缩或不饱满。春暖雨早，发病愈早，小麦受损失亦愈大。如果在孕穗期严重流行，可能成为“锁口疸”，即穗子抽不出来，致颗粒无收。因此必须贯彻治早治少治了的精神，抓紧小麦返青关，彻底消灭条锈病。不然，病菌过了关，以后防治不但费工费药，植株深密，操作困难，而小麦已因病受亏减产，这是无法弥补的。
    条锈病菌适于荫凉气候，不耐高温，因此在平原地带是不能活过夏季的。但在二千公尺以上的高山高原地区由于夏季温度较低，条锈病菌是可以在这些地区寄生越夏的。春季在平川地区条锈病菌的夏孢子随风逐渐向高原或高山地区传布，在春麦或野生春苗上寄生为害，繁殖越夏。秋后又随风由高原高山地区逐步传布到平原的冬麦区，侵染秋季麦苗，并在冬麦区越冬。如此周而复始，完成其越冬越夏的侵染循环。根据陕西省条锈病菌的越冬越夏规律，可以得到这样的启示：（1）如果能打断条锈病菌越冬越夏锁链，即可彻底消灭条锈病。（2）条锈病在关中流行，主要是由当地秋苗上的病菌越冬后逐渐繁殖累积扩大蔓延而来的。因此，如果彻底消灭了秋苗上的病菌或彻底消灭了早春越冬后的菌源，便可有效的制止条锈病的流行。这就更可以说明为什么强调严守冬前关，和必须把条锈病菌消灭在小麦返青关的理由了。　　　　　　　　　（原载陕西日报）
