Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: News from Tokyo: The north and south routes of the Japanese people's National Grand March Against War and Unemployment arrived in Tokyo on the 4th. After holding demonstrations in the streets, they joined with the two marching teams organized by Tokyo citizens, singing progressive songs and marching mightily to Yotsuya Sotobori Park to participate in the "Central General Uprising Rally of the National Grand March Against War and Unemployment." The 30,000 people attending the rally warmly applauded to welcome the marching teams.

The march teams demanding the innocent release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," which departed from Fukuoka in Kyushu on February 26th and from Sendai in Hokkaido on March 1st, also arrived in Tokyo today and participated in the rally.

At the rally, Shioya Nobuo, a standing director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, spoke first. He pointed out that this grand march has epoch-making significance in the history of the Japanese people's movement. Shioya called on all participants to concentrate their efforts to crush the war system and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Representatives of the north and south grand march teams, representatives of the march teams demanding the innocent release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and representatives of the two march teams in Tokyo spoke at the meeting successively. They unanimously called on all participants to further develop the movement against war and unemployment, and to oppose the war threats and unemployment caused by the conclusion of the Japan-US "Security Treaty." They also called on participants to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The conference passed a declaration amidst warm applause. The declaration called on the Japanese people to more actively engage in the struggle to abolish the Japan-US "Security Treaty," to abolish US military bases in Japan, and to withdraw US troops stationed in Japan.

The declaration demanded the enactment of regulations prohibiting Japan from nuclear armament, the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, and the adoption of emergency measures to send Korean residents in Japan back to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The declaration called on the Japanese people to oppose unemployment, oppose exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, strive to increase wages and safeguard the democratic rights of the working people, strive for the innocent release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and smash all the reactionary conspiracies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to revive militarism.

The declaration called on the Japanese people to further strengthen their unity and continue their struggle to more heavily strike the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital. (Attached picture)
