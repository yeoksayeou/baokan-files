    Viewing Luo Gongliu's Oil Painting Studies
    Cai Shuxin
    Upon hearing the news of Comrade Luo Gongliu's return from the Soviet Union, I wanted to see his works. Recently, I had the opportunity to see his exhibition of studies and felt very happy. Comrade Luo Gongliu is a painter skilled in using color. Each painting has bright, full, and harmonious colors. The poetic feeling and beautiful colors that fill his paintings are combined to smoothly express the image of objects. He is good at expressing the mood and atmosphere of things. For example, "Girl from Crimea" depicts a scene of a Crimean girl under the trees. Her expression is very natural, and the overall tone is harmonious. The painting of her face and the lines of her clothes are all expressed with skillful techniques. Another example is "Coast," a small piece, a small picture, but very pleasing to the eye. The author used ingenious techniques to express the characteristics of the coast. The color of the sea water is so complex and varied. From the works, it can be seen that Comrade Luo Gongliu has made great progress in technique during his short three years of study.
    I visited this exhibition three times. Comrade Luo Gongliu's hard work and technical achievements are quite satisfactory. However, there is also a slight dissatisfaction, which is that the subject matter of this exhibition is somewhat limited. Comrade Luo Gongliu studied in the Soviet Union for three years, so we naturally hope that in his exhibition upon returning home, he can bring us more new things, such as the industrial construction of the Soviet Union, the life of Soviet collective farms and their members, and the heroic spirit of the Soviet people advancing towards communism. Regarding these, apart from some copies, the works in this exhibition are very insufficient. Although these are all studies, if the painter could pay more attention to the observation and depiction of new things during the sketching process, allowing domestic audiences to understand the changes in the lives of the Soviet people, wouldn't that be a great thing?
    Our country's oil painting art is still very young. In terms of technique, we do need to study hard and strive to improve. However, the ultimate goal of improving artistry is still to serve the socialist construction of the motherland, to express the thoughts of the working people, and to use art to infect and educate the people. Our country's socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. Therefore, we hope that Comrade Luo Gongliu and other accomplished painters can use their art to reflect the new face of our country's Great Leap Forward.

    看罗工柳的油画习作
    蔡叔馨
    听到罗工柳同志从苏联回国的消息，我就想看看他的作品，最近有机会看到了他的习作展览会，感到很高兴。罗工柳同志是位善于运用色彩的画家，每张画都有鲜明、丰满、和谐的颜色。充满在他画里的诗意和美丽的色彩结合在一起，舒畅地表现了物的形象。他善于表达事物的情境与气氛。例如“克里米亚的姑娘”，画的是克里米亚姑娘在树林下的情景，她的表情很自然，全部的调子是和谐的，面部的画法和衣服的线条，都用熟练的技巧表现了出来。又如“海岸”，是幅小品，小小的画面，但很耐看。作者用巧妙的技法，表达了海岸的特点，海水的颜色，是那样的复杂而多采。从作品中看出，在短短的三年学习中，罗工柳同志在技术上有了很大的进步。
    这次画展我参观了三次。罗工柳同志的辛勤劳动和技法上的成就，是相当令人满意的。但也还有一点不太满意之处，这就是这次展览作品在题材上还有局限性。罗工柳同志在苏联学习三年，因此我们很自然地希望能在他归国的展览中，能带给我们更多一些新东西，例如苏联的工业建设，苏联的集体农庄、庄员们的生活，以及豪迈的苏联人民向共产主义前进的气概。对于这些，这次展览作品中除出一些临摹品之外，是十分不足的。虽然这些都是习作，但是在写生的过程中，如果画家能够更多地注意对新事物的观察和描绘，让国内的观众能了解到苏联人民生活的变化，岂不是很好的事情吗？
    我国的油画艺术还很年青，在技术方面的确需要艰苦学习，努力提高，但是提高艺术性的终极目的，还是为祖国的社会主义建设服务，为了表达劳动人民的思想，用艺术来感染和教育人民。我们祖国的社会主义建设，正在一日千里地前进，为此我们希望罗工柳同志和其他有成就的画家们能够运用自己的艺术，来反映我国大跃进中的新面貌。
