The People's Liberation Army Has Swiftly Quelled the Rebellion in Lhasa
With the Assistance of Patriotic People from All Sectors of the Monastic and Secular Community, They are Advancing Triumphantly to Wipe Out the Bandits in Other Parts of Tibet
Contrary to the Wishes of Imperialist Elements and Tibetan Reactionary Forces, the Rebellion They Launched Did Not Cause the Division and Regression of the Motherland, but Promoted the Consolidation of the Motherland's Unity, the Destruction of Tibetan Reactionary Forces, the Democratization of Tibet, and the Rebirth of the Tibetan People.
Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Xinhua News Agency's Communiqué on the Tibetan Rebellion.

The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, in violation of the will of the Tibetan people, betrayed the motherland, colluded with imperialism, and gathered bandits to launch an armed attack on the People's Liberation Army garrison in Lhasa on the night of March 19. Our heroic People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet were ordered to suppress the rebellion and have thoroughly crushed the bandits in the Lhasa urban area on the 22nd. Now, with the assistance of patriotic people from all sectors of the monastic and secular community in Tibet, our army is continuing to sweep away the bandits in some other parts of Tibet.

In order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council issued an order on March 28, instructing the Tibet Military Region to thoroughly quell the rebellion and, from that date, dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, with the functions of the Tibetan local government to be exercised by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

On March 10, the rebel group kidnapped the Dalai Lama, injured the deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and surrounded the military region headquarters and the central government's Lhasa-based organs.

The armed rebellion in Lhasa by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique began on March 10. The Dalai Lama was originally scheduled to go to the auditorium of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army on March 10 to see a play. The matter of going to the military region auditorium to see a play was proposed by the Dalai Lama himself more than a month ago, and the date of March 10 was also decided by him. On that day, the Tibetan rebel group spread rumors that the Tibet Military Region troops were going to detain the Dalai Lama, and using this as an excuse, launched an armed rebellion, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, put forward reactionary slogans such as "Drive out the Han people" and "Tibetan independence," and killed Kanqiong Suolang Jiangcuo, a Tibetan official of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region who opposed the rebellion, and injured Sangpo Cewang Renzen, the Tibetan deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and others. At the same time, the rebel forces surrounded the headquarters of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the organs of the central government stationed in Lhasa.

The traitorous elements represent imperialism and the most reactionary serf owners in Tibet, and have been plotting to tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and prepare for an armed rebellion.

The rebellion activities of the Tibetan traitors have a long history. These rebels represent imperialism and the most reactionary big serf owners in Tibet. Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in 1951, and the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet (i.e., the Seventeen-Article Agreement), they have been plotting to tear up this agreement and preparing for an armed rebellion. Due to the increasing prosperity of the motherland, the correct policies of the Central People's Government towards Tibet, and the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, which have been warmly loved by people from all walks of life in Tibet, the rebellion plot of this small group of reactionary elements has not received support among the Tibetan people. The Central People's Government has always adhered to the unity between all ethnic groups in the country and the unity of the Tibetan people themselves, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and implemented national regional autonomy in Tibet, which is warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established as early as April 1956. However, due to the obstruction of reactionary elements in the Tibetan local government, the preparatory work for the autonomous region has made little progress. The Seventeen-Article Agreement stipulates that the Tibetan army should be reorganized, and the Tibetan social system, i.e., the serf system, should be reformed according to the wishes of the people. Both of these important tasks have not been realized due to the obstruction of reactionary elements. In order to wait for these reactionary elements to become aware of their errors, the central government also informed them at the end of 1956 that no reforms or reorganization of the Tibetan army would be carried out within six years, i.e., during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Two of the six members of the Tibetan local government are patriotic elements, while the remaining four have openly rebelled. Their rebellion was instigated by imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries.

The Tibetan local government, known as the "Kasha" in Tibetan, has six members, known as "Kalons." Among the six Kalons, two are patriotic elements, namely Ape Awang Jinmei and Sangpo Cewang Renzen, who was injured by the rebels on March 10. Among the remaining four, Yutuo Zaxi Dundu has already betrayed the motherland in 1957 and fled to Kalimpong, the overseas activity center for rebel elements; the other three, namely Suokang Wangqing Gele, Liuxia Tudeng Taba, and Xianka Jumei Duojie (Xiasu), have also openly rebelled this time. Prior to this, these traitors had already used their legal positions in the Kasha to gather upper-class reactionary forces, collude with foreign enemies, and actually command some of the most reactionary big serf owners in the Kangzang region to organize rebel forces in some areas east, north, and south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River to oppose the central government and betray the motherland. Their rebellion was instigated by imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. The command center of the rebellion was in Kalimpong, and its leader was the dismissed former Tibetan King (known as "Sicao" in Tibetan) Lukuangwa Zewang Raodeng. Many of their weapons were imported from abroad. In the rebel base south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, there were many instances of receiving air-drop assistance from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and there were also many special agent radio stations dispatched by imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek, carrying out conspiratorial activities.

The reactionary clique regarded the central government's attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness towards the Tibetan local government as weakness and deceit, and on March 19, launched a full-scale attack on the PLA troops stationed in Lhasa.

From May and June of last year, the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique instructed bandits to harass Changdu, Dingqing, Heihe, Shannan, and other areas, disrupting transportation, looting property, raping, burning, killing, and harming the people, and attacking central government organs and troops stationed there. In the spirit of national unity, the central government repeatedly ordered the Tibetan local government to be responsible for punishing the rebels and maintaining social order. However, the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique regarded this attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness on the part of the central government as weakness and deceit. They said that the Han people could be scared away; for nine years, the Han people dared not touch our most beautiful and sacred serf system; when we hit them, they could only parry and had no power to fight back; they did not dare to suppress the rebellion, but only wanted us to be responsible for suppressing it; as long as we transferred a large number of rebel forces from other places to Lhasa, and gave them a beating, the Han people would surely run away; if they did not run away, we would take the Dalai Buddha to the South Mountain, gather strength, and launch a counter-attack to regain Lhasa; if that did not work, we would flee to India; India sympathizes with us and may assist us; there is also the powerful United States, which may also assist us; President Chiang of Taiwan has been actively assisting us; the Dalai is a god, who dares to disobey? The Americans said that the people's communes in China are causing resentment in heaven and among men, and everyone is going to rebel, now is a great opportunity to drive out the Han and establish independence; and so on. The souls of these reactionaries have flown to the ninth heaven, and they simply want to govern the entire universe. Therefore, not only did they not take responsibility for stopping the harassment of the bandits, but they intensified their efforts and actively carried out conspiratorial activities to betray the country. After concentrating a considerable number of counter-revolutionary armed forces in Lhasa, they finally openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on March 10 and launched an armed rebellion.

After the outbreak of the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the Dalai Lama sent three letters to the central government representatives in Tibet, stating that he had been kidnapped by reactionary elements and that he was doing everything possible to deal with the illegal actions of the reactionary clique. In their reply, the central government representatives welcomed this attitude of the Dalai Lama and stated that they still hoped that the Tibetan local government would change its erroneous attitude and be responsible for quelling the rebellion. However, these reactionary elements not only showed no repentance but were determined to expand the rebellion. On March 17, they brazenly kidnapped the Dalai Lama out of Lhasa, and on the night of March 19, they launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa. The hope for a peaceful resolution vanished. The Tibetan reactionary forces finally chose the path that led to their own destruction.

The People's Liberation Army was ordered to punish the heinous traitorous group, and after more than two days of fighting, thoroughly crushed the Lhasa rebels, capturing more than 4,000 rebels.

At 10:00 a.m. on March 20, the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were ordered to punish the heinous traitorous group. With the assistance of patriotic monks, nuns, and laypeople of the Tibetan ethnic group, the People's Liberation Army, after more than two days of fighting, has thoroughly crushed the rebellion in the urban area of Lhasa. According to preliminary statistics, as of the 23rd, more than 4,000 rebel soldiers have been captured, and more than 8,000 various types of guns, 81 light and heavy machine guns, 27 81mm mortars, 6 mountain guns, and 10 million rounds of ammunition have been seized. Many rebel soldiers surrendered in droves after being surrounded by our army.

The Tibetan people are patriotic. Tibet already has a working class that resolutely demands liberation and a large number of patriotic and progressive figures from the upper and middle strata, as well as centrists, who support reform.

The rapid suppression of the Lhasa rebellion shows that the Tibetan traitorous group is bound to perish, and the future of the Tibetan people is bright. This is primarily because the Tibetan people are patriotic, they support the Central People's Government, love the People's Liberation Army, and oppose imperialism and traitorous elements. Tibet (including the three regions of Qamdo, Tsang, and Ü-Tsang) has a population of 1.2 million, while the rebels number only about 20,000, the majority of whom participated because they were deceived or coerced, and also include some rebels who fled from the former Xikang Province east of the Jinsha River, the so-called Khampas. The vast majority of the Tibetan people are extremely poor farmers and herdsmen who urgently hope to be liberated from the darkest feudal serf system in the world. There are also many patriotic and progressive people in the upper and middle strata of Tibet who support the central government, oppose the rebellion, and advocate democratically reforming the unreasonable social system so that Tibet can gradually become a civilized and progressive place. In this way, Tibet already has a working class that resolutely demands liberation, and a large number of patriotic and progressive figures from the upper and middle strata, as well as centrists, who support reform. The current task is, first of all, to quell the rebellion and establish a peaceful order. In this process, the central government's policy towards the rebel elements is: the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced will not be held accountable, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. The central government has instructed the People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet to broadly unite with all Tibetan compatriots who have not participated in the rebellion, to be responsible for protecting the lives and property of people from all walks of life in Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, commerce, politics, and religion, to respect the people's customs and religious beliefs, to protect lama temples and cultural relics, and to safeguard the interests of the masses and social order. Retaliation, injury, and insult are strictly prohibited towards prisoners of war and all enemies who have laid down their weapons.

The Chinese government believes that the relationship between China and its southwestern neighbors, and first of all between our country and the great friendly nation of the Republic of India, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were first proposed in the Agreement Between China and India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India, signed on April 29, 1954. Now and in the future, for the fundamental interests of both countries, there is no reason for either side not to adhere to these principles to the end. Chinese government officials welcome the statement made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on March 23 regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs, considering this statement to be friendly. The Chinese side has never interfered in India's internal affairs, nor has it discussed India's internal affairs in the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee, and believes that it is impolite and inappropriate to conduct such discussions on the internal affairs of a friendly country.

Ali in the west of Lhasa, Gyantse, Phari, and Yatung in the southwest of Lhasa, Damxung and Heihe in the north of Lhasa, Zedang in the south of Lhasa, and Tsetang, Nyingchi, Zhamu, Dingqing, Qamdo, and Chayu in the east of Lhasa, are all under the firm control of the People's Liberation Army.

In order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits, the State Council has ordered the PLA troops stationed in Tibet to implement military control in various parts of Tibet. The tasks of the military control committee are to suppress the rebellion; protect the people; protect foreign nationals who abide by Chinese law; and, entrusted by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, organize administrative organs at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region and organize the self-defense forces of the patriotic people of Tibet to replace the corrupt, rebellious, and combat-ineffective old Tibetan army, which numbers only more than 3,000 people. The Military Control Committee of Lhasa City was announced on March 23. Military control committees in other regions will also be established one after another, with the exception of Shigatse, the capital of the post-Tibet region led by Panchen Erdeni, where there is no need to establish one. The Lhasa and local military control committees are composed jointly of representatives of the People's Liberation Army and representatives of the local patriotic people. Ali in the west of Lhasa, Gyantse, Phari, and Yatung in the southwest of Lhasa, Damxung and Heihe in the north of Lhasa, Zedang in the south of Lhasa, and Tsetang, Nyingchi, Zhamu, Dingqing, Qamdo, and Chayu in the east of Lhasa, are all under the firm control of the People's Liberation Army, and the vast majority of the local people are cooperating closely with the People's Liberation Army. The places where the bandits are active are only some very remote areas.

In view of the fact that Dalai Lama, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, is still being held hostage, the State Council has decided that Panchen Erdeni, the Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, will serve as the Acting Chairman of the Committee during the period when the Dalai Lama is being held hostage. The State Council also appointed Phabala Zhuolie Langjie Living Buddha and Ape Awang Jinmei, members of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, as Vice Chairmen, with Ape also serving concurrently as Secretary-General. In various parts of Tibet, as soon as order is restored, local administrative organs at all levels of the Tibet Autonomous Region will be established one after another, and the exercise of autonomous powers will begin. In the current period, the autonomous system and the military control system of the People's Liberation Army will operate concurrently. With the suppression of the rebellion and the establishment of a peaceful order, the autonomous system will gradually completely replace the military control system.

Due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page in the history of Tibet is unfolding.

Due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page in the history of Tibet is unfolding. It can now be concluded that the imperialist elements and the Tibetan reactionary forces completely misjudged the situation in Tibet. Contrary to their wishes, the rebellion they launched in Tibet did not cause the division and regression of the motherland, but promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unity, the destruction of Tibetan reactionary forces, the democratization of Tibet, and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

    西藏叛国集团必然灭亡　西藏人民前途光明灿烂
    解放军已迅速平定拉萨叛乱
    在僧俗各界爱国人民协助下，正乘胜前进扫荡西藏其它地方的叛匪
    同帝国主义分子和西藏反动势力的愿望相反，他们发动的叛乱，不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    新华社28日讯　新华社关于西藏叛乱事件的公报。
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，违反西藏人民的意志，背叛祖国，勾结帝国主义，纠集叛匪，于3月19日夜间在拉萨向人民解放军驻军发动武装进攻。我英勇的人民解放军驻西藏部队奉命讨平叛乱，已在22日彻底地粉碎了拉萨市区的叛匪。现在我军正在西藏僧俗各界爱国人民的协助下，继续向西藏一些其他地方的叛匪进行扫荡中。
    为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，国务院周恩来总理3月28日发布命令，除了责成西藏军区彻底平息叛乱以外，决定自即日起，解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府的职权。
    叛乱集团3月10日劫持达赖喇嘛，打伤西藏军区副司令，包围军区司令部和中央驻拉萨机关。
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在拉萨的武装叛乱，3月10日就开始了。达赖喇嘛原定在3月10日到人民解放军西藏军区礼堂看戏。到军区礼堂看戏的事，是达赖喇嘛自己在一个多月以前提出的，3月10日这个日期，也是他自己决定的。西藏叛乱集团到了这一天，却大肆散布西藏军区部队要扣留达赖喇嘛的谣言，并且以此为借口，发动武装叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛，提出“赶走汉人”、“西藏独立”等反动口号，并且当场打死反对叛乱的西藏自治区筹备委员会藏族官员堪穷索朗降措，打伤西藏军区藏族副司令桑颇·才旺仁增等人。叛乱武装同时包围了人民解放军西藏军区司令部和中央驻在拉萨的机关。
    叛国分子代表帝国主义和西藏最反动的大农奴主，一直蓄谋撕毁和平解放西藏的协议，准备武装叛变。
    西藏叛国分子的叛乱活动，由来已久。这些叛乱分子代表帝国主义和西藏最反动的大农奴主。自从1951年中国人民解放军进驻西藏，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议（即十七条协议）以来，他们就蓄谋撕毁这一协议，准备武装叛变。由于祖国日益繁荣昌盛，中央人民政府对西藏政策正确，人民解放军驻西藏部队纪律严明，受到西藏各界人民热烈爱戴，这一小撮反动分子的叛乱阴谋在藏族人民中得不到支持。中央人民政府根据宪法规定，历来坚持国内各族人民之间的团结和西藏人民本身的团结，在西藏实行民族地方自治，这是西藏人民所热烈欢迎的。西藏自治区筹备委员会早已于1956年4月成立。但是，由于西藏地方政府中反动分子的阻挠，自治区的筹备工作很少进展。十七条协议中规定藏军要改编，西藏社会制度即农奴制度要按照人民愿望加以改革，这两项重要任务，都因为反动分子的阻挠，不能实现。中央为了等待这些反动分子的觉悟，还在1956年底，就告诉他们，在六年内，即第二个五年计划期间，可以不进行改革，也不改编藏军。
    西藏地方政府六个委员，有两个是爱国分子，其余四人已公开叛变。他们的叛乱是受帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派策动的。
    西藏地方政府，藏语称为噶厦，委员六人，称为噶伦。在六个噶伦中，两个是爱国分子，即阿沛·阿旺晋美和在3月10日被叛匪打伤的桑颇·才旺仁增。其余四人中，宇妥·扎西顿珠已在1957年叛离祖国，逃往叛乱分子在国外活动中心的噶伦堡；另三人即索康·旺清格勒、柳霞·土登塔巴、先喀·居美多杰（夏苏），在这次也已经公开叛变。在这以前，这些叛国分子即已利用他们在噶厦中的合法地位，纠集上层反动势力，勾结外敌，实际指挥康藏两地一些最反动的大农奴主，在雅鲁藏布江以东、以北、以南若干地方，组织叛乱武装，反对中央，背叛祖国。他们的叛乱是受帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派策动的，叛乱的指挥中心在噶伦堡，其领袖为被撤职的前任藏王（藏语称为司曹）鲁康娃·泽旺饶登。他们的武器，不少是从外国输入的。在雅鲁藏布江以南的叛乱根据地，就有多次接受蒋介石匪帮的空投接济，还设有帝国主义和蒋介石派遣的许多特务电台，进行阴谋活动。
    反动集团把中央对西藏地方政府仁至义尽的态度看作软弱可欺，在3月19日竟向解放军驻拉萨部队发动全面进攻。
    从去年5、6月间起，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团就指示叛匪窜扰昌都、丁青、黑河、山南等地区，破坏交通，劫掠财物，奸淫烧杀，残害人民，并且袭击中央派驻当地的机关、部队。中央本着民族团结精神，一再责成西藏地方政府负责惩办叛乱分子，维护社会治安。但是，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，把中央这种仁至义尽的态度看作软弱可欺。他们说，汉人是可以吓跑的；九年以来，汉人动也不敢动一下我们的最美妙最神圣的农奴制度；我们打他们，他们只有招架之功，并无还手之力；他们不敢平叛，只是要我们负责平叛；只要我们从外地调来一大批叛乱武装到拉萨，给一打，汉人准跑；如果不跑，我们就把达赖佛爷架往南山，聚集力量，举行反攻，夺回拉萨；最后不行，就跑印度；印度是同情我们的，可能援助我们；还有强大的美国，也可能援助；台湾蒋总统，已经积极援助；达赖是神，谁敢不从？美国人说过，中国人民公社闹的天怒人怨，都要造反了，现在是驱汉自立的大好时机；云云。这些反动派的灵魂，已经飞到九霄云外，简直要管领整个宇宙了。因此，他们非但不负责制止叛匪的骚扰，反而变本加厉，积极进行叛国的阴谋活动。他们在拉萨集中了相当数量的反革命武力以后，终于在3月10日公开撕毁十七条协议，发动武装叛乱。
    在3月10日拉萨叛乱爆发以后，达赖喇嘛曾三次给中央驻藏代表来信，说明他已被反动分子劫持，并且表示正在尽一切可能设法处理反动集团的违法行为。中央代表在复信中欢迎达赖喇嘛这种态度，同时表示仍然希望西藏地方政府改变错误态度，负责平息叛乱。但是，这些反动分子不但毫不悔改，还决心扩大叛乱。他们在3月17日悍然将达赖喇嘛劫出拉萨，并且在3月19日夜间向人民解放军驻拉萨部队发动了全面进攻。和平解决的希望消灭了。西藏反动势力最后选定了使他们自己走向灭亡的道路。
    解放军奉命讨伐罪大恶极的叛国集团，经过两天多战斗，已彻底粉碎拉萨叛匪，俘获叛军四千多人。
    3月20日上午十时，中国人民解放军西藏军区部队奉命对罪大恶极的叛国集团进行讨伐。人民解放军在藏族爱国僧俗人民的协助下，经过两天多的战斗，已经彻底地粉碎了拉萨市区的叛乱。据初步统计，截至23日止，已俘获了叛军四千余名，缴获了各种枪八千余枝，轻重机枪八十一挺，八一迫击炮二十七门，山炮六门，子弹一千万发。许多叛军在我军包围后成股地投降。
    西藏人民是爱国的。西藏已有一个坚决要求解放的劳动阶级和很大一部分赞成改革的上层和中层爱国进步人士以及中间派人士。
    拉萨叛乱的迅速平定，说明西藏叛国集团必然灭亡，西藏人民的前途是光明的。这首先是因为，西藏人民是爱国的，他们拥护中央人民政府，热爱人民解放军，反对帝国主义和叛国分子。西藏（包括昌都、前藏、后藏三个区域）共有人口一百二十万人，而叛匪只有两万人左右，其中多数是因为被欺骗裹胁而参加的，并且还包括一部分由金沙江以东原西康省地区逃跑过去的叛乱分子，即所谓康巴人。西藏人民绝大多数是极端贫苦的农民和牧民，他们迫切地希望从世界上最黑暗的封建农奴制度之下解放出来。西藏上层和中层也有许多爱国进步人士，他们拥护中央，反对叛乱，并且主张民主地改革不合理的社会制度，使西藏逐步地变为一个文明进步的地方。这样，西藏已有一个坚决要求解放的劳动阶级，和很大一部分赞成改革的上层和中层爱国进步人士以及中间派人士。目前的任务，首先是平息叛乱，建立和平秩序。在这一过程中，中央对于叛乱分子的方针是：首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖。中央已指示在西藏的人民解放军部队广泛团结一切没有参加叛乱的藏族同胞，负责保护西藏农牧工商政教各界人民的生命财产，尊重人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，保护喇嘛寺庙和文物古迹，维护群众利益和社会秩序。对于俘虏和一切放下武器的敌人，一律不许报复、伤害和侮辱。
    中国政府方面认为，中国与西南邻国的关系，首先是我国与伟大友好国家印度共和国的关系，是坚持和平共处的五项原则。和平共处的五项原则，是在1954年4月29日中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中首次提出的，现在和将来，为了两国的根本利益，双方都没有任何理由不将这些原则坚持到底。中国政府人士欢迎印度总理尼赫鲁先生3月23日关于不干涉中国内政的声明，认为这个声明是友好的。中国方面从来没有干涉过印度的内政，也没有在全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会上谈论过印度的内政，并且认为对一个友好国家的内政进行这样的谈论是不礼貌和不适当的。
    现在拉萨以西的阿里，拉萨西南的江孜、帕里、亚东，拉萨以北的当雄、黑河，拉萨以南的泽当，拉萨以东的太昭、林芝、扎木、丁青、昌都、察隅等重镇和要区，都在解放军的坚强控制之下。
    为了彻底肃清叛匪，国务院已命令人民解放军驻藏部队在西藏各地实行军事管制。军事管制委员会的任务是：镇压叛乱；保护人民；保护遵守中国法律的外国侨民；受西藏自治区筹备委员会和人民解放军西藏军区的委托，组织西藏自治区的各级行政机构和组织西藏爱国人民的自卫武装，以代替腐败透顶、已经叛变、毫无战斗力、而且为数只有三千多人的旧藏军。拉萨市的军事管制委员会已在3月23日宣布成立。其他各地的军管会，除班禅额尔德尼领导的后藏地区的首府日喀则没有必要建立以外，都将陆续建立。拉萨和各地军事管制委员会都由人民解放军的代表和当地爱国人民的代表共同组成。现在拉萨以西的阿里，拉萨西南的江孜、帕里、亚东，拉萨以北的当雄、黑河，拉萨以南的泽当，拉萨以东的太昭、林芝、扎木、丁青、昌都、察隅等重镇和要区，都在人民解放军的坚强控制之下，当地人民的绝大多数是与人民解放军密切合作的。叛匪活动的地方，只是一些很偏僻的地区。
    鉴于西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员达赖喇嘛尚被劫持，国务院决定在达赖喇嘛被劫期间，由自治区筹备委员会副主任委员班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员职务。国务院并任命自治区筹备委员会藏族常务委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛和阿沛·阿旺晋美为副主任委员，阿沛并兼任秘书长。在西藏各地，一俟秩序恢复，都将陆续建立西藏自治区的各级地方行政机构，并开始执行自治职权。在目前时期，自治制度与人民解放军的军管制度同时并行。随着叛乱的平息，和平秩序的建立，自治制度将逐步完全代替军管制度。
    由于西藏反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的失败，西藏的历史正在展开新的一页
    由于西藏反动势力的叛乱和叛乱的失败，西藏的历史正在展开新的一页。现在已经可以得出结论：帝国主义分子和西藏反动势力把西藏的形势完全估计错了。同他们的愿望相反，他们在西藏发动的叛乱不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
