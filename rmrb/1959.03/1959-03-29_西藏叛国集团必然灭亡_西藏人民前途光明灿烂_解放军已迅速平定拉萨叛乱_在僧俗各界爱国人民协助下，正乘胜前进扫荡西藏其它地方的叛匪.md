The People's Liberation Army Has Swiftly Quelled the Rebellion in Lhasa
With the Assistance of Patriotic People from All Sectors of the Monastic and Secular Community, They are Advancing Triumphantly to Wipe Out the Bandits in Other Parts of Tibet
Contrary to the Wishes of Imperialist Elements and Tibetan Reactionary Forces, the Rebellion They Launched Did Not Cause the Division and Regression of the Motherland, but Promoted the Consolidation of the Motherland's Unity, the Destruction of Tibetan Reactionary Forces, the Democratization of Tibet, and the Rebirth of the Tibetan People.
Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Xinhua News Agency's Communiqu√© on the Tibetan Rebellion.

The Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, in violation of the will of the Tibetan people, betrayed the motherland, colluded with imperialism, and gathered bandits to launch an armed attack on the People's Liberation Army garrison in Lhasa on the night of March 19. Our heroic People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet were ordered to suppress the rebellion and have thoroughly crushed the bandits in the Lhasa urban area on the 22nd. Now, with the assistance of patriotic people from all sectors of the monastic and secular community in Tibet, our army is continuing to sweep away the bandits in some other parts of Tibet.

In order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council issued an order on March 28, instructing the Tibet Military Region to thoroughly quell the rebellion and, from that date, dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, with the functions of the Tibetan local government to be exercised by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

On March 10, the rebel group kidnapped the Dalai Lama, injured the deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and surrounded the military region headquarters and the central government's Lhasa-based organs.

The armed rebellion in Lhasa by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique began on March 10. The Dalai Lama was originally scheduled to go to the auditorium of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army on March 10 to see a play. The matter of going to the military region auditorium to see a play was proposed by the Dalai Lama himself more than a month ago, and the date of March 10 was also decided by him. On that day, the Tibetan rebel group spread rumors that the Tibet Military Region troops were going to detain the Dalai Lama, and using this as an excuse, launched an armed rebellion, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, put forward reactionary slogans such as "Drive out the Han people" and "Tibetan independence," and killed Kanqiong Suolang Jiangcuo, a Tibetan official of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region who opposed the rebellion, and injured Sangpo Cewang Renzen, the Tibetan deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and others. At the same time, the rebel forces surrounded the headquarters of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the organs of the central government stationed in Lhasa.

The traitorous elements represent imperialism and the most reactionary serf owners in Tibet, and have been plotting to tear up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and prepare for an armed rebellion.

The rebellion activities of the Tibetan traitors have a long history. These rebels represent imperialism and the most reactionary big serf owners in Tibet. Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in 1951, and the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet (i.e., the Seventeen-Article Agreement), they have been plotting to tear up this agreement and preparing for an armed rebellion. Due to the increasing prosperity of the motherland, the correct policies of the Central People's Government towards Tibet, and the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, which have been warmly loved by people from all walks of life in Tibet, the rebellion plot of this small group of reactionary elements has not received support among the Tibetan people. The Central People's Government has always adhered to the unity between all ethnic groups in the country and the unity of the Tibetan people themselves, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and implemented national regional autonomy in Tibet, which is warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established as early as April 1956. However, due to the obstruction of reactionary elements in the Tibetan local government, the preparatory work for the autonomous region has made little progress. The Seventeen-Article Agreement stipulates that the Tibetan army should be reorganized, and the Tibetan social system, i.e., the serf system, should be reformed according to the wishes of the people. Both of these important tasks have not been realized due to the obstruction of reactionary elements. In order to wait for these reactionary elements to become aware of their errors, the central government also informed them at the end of 1956 that no reforms or reorganization of the Tibetan army would be carried out within six years, i.e., during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Two of the six members of the Tibetan local government are patriotic elements, while the remaining four have openly rebelled. Their rebellion was instigated by imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries.

The Tibetan local government, known as the "Kasha" in Tibetan, has six members, known as "Kalons." Among the six Kalons, two are patriotic elements, namely Ape Awang Jinmei and Sangpo Cewang Renzen, who was injured by the rebels on March 10. Among the remaining four, Yutuo Zaxi Dundu has already betrayed the motherland in 1957 and fled to Kalimpong, the overseas activity center for rebel elements; the other three, namely Suokang Wangqing Gele, Liuxia Tudeng Taba, and Xianka Jumei Duojie (Xiasu), have also openly rebelled this time. Prior to this, these traitors had already used their legal positions in the Kasha to gather upper-class reactionary forces, collude with foreign enemies, and actually command some of the most reactionary big serf owners in the Kangzang region to organize rebel forces in some areas east, north, and south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River to oppose the central government and betray the motherland. Their rebellion was instigated by imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. The command center of the rebellion was in Kalimpong, and its leader was the dismissed former Tibetan King (known as "Sicao" in Tibetan) Lukuangwa Zewang Raodeng. Many of their weapons were imported from abroad. In the rebel base south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, there were many instances of receiving air-drop assistance from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and there were also many special agent radio stations dispatched by imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek, carrying out conspiratorial activities.

The reactionary clique regarded the central government's attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness towards the Tibetan local government as weakness and deceit, and on March 19, launched a full-scale attack on the PLA troops stationed in Lhasa.

From May and June of last year, the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique instructed bandits to harass Changdu, Dingqing, Heihe, Shannan, and other areas, disrupting transportation, looting property, raping, burning, killing, and harming the people, and attacking central government organs and troops stationed there. In the spirit of national unity, the central government repeatedly ordered the Tibetan local government to be responsible for punishing the rebels and maintaining social order. However, the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique regarded this attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness on the part of the central government as weakness and deceit. They said that the Han people could be scared away; for nine years, the Han people dared not touch our most beautiful and sacred serf system; when we hit them, they could only parry and had no power to fight back; they did not dare to suppress the rebellion, but only wanted us to be responsible for suppressing it; as long as we transferred a large number of rebel forces from other places to Lhasa, and gave them a beating, the Han people would surely run away; if they did not run away, we would take the Dalai Buddha to the South Mountain, gather strength, and launch a counter-attack to regain Lhasa; if that did not work, we would flee to India; India sympathizes with us and may assist us; there is also the powerful United States, which may also assist us; President Chiang of Taiwan has been actively assisting us; the Dalai is a god, who dares to disobey? The Americans said that the people's communes in China are causing resentment in heaven and among men, and everyone is going to rebel, now is a great opportunity to drive out the Han and establish independence; and so on. The souls of these reactionaries have flown to the ninth heaven, and they simply want to govern the entire universe. Therefore, not only did they not take responsibility for stopping the harassment of the bandits, but they intensified their efforts and actively carried out conspiratorial activities to betray the country. After concentrating a considerable number of counter-revolutionary armed forces in Lhasa, they finally openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on March 10 and launched an armed rebellion.

After the outbreak of the Lhasa rebellion on March 10, the Dalai Lama sent three letters to the central government representatives in Tibet, stating that he had been kidnapped by reactionary elements and that he was doing everything possible to deal with the illegal actions of the reactionary clique. In their reply, the central government representatives welcomed this attitude of the Dalai Lama and stated that they still hoped that the Tibetan local government would change its erroneous attitude and be responsible for quelling the rebellion. However, these reactionary elements not only showed no repentance but were determined to expand the rebellion. On March 17, they brazenly kidnapped the Dalai Lama out of Lhasa, and on the night of March 19, they launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa. The hope for a peaceful resolution vanished. The Tibetan reactionary forces finally chose the path that led to their own destruction.

The People's Liberation Army was ordered to punish the heinous traitorous group, and after more than two days of fighting, thoroughly crushed the Lhasa rebels, capturing more than 4,000 rebels.

At 10:00 a.m. on March 20, the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were ordered to punish the heinous traitorous group. With the assistance of patriotic monks, nuns, and laypeople of the Tibetan ethnic group, the People's Liberation Army, after more than two days of fighting, has thoroughly crushed the rebellion in the urban area of Lhasa. According to preliminary statistics, as of the 23rd, more than 4,000 rebel soldiers have been captured, and more than 8,000 various types of guns, 81 light and heavy machine guns, 27 81mm mortars, 6 mountain guns, and 10 million rounds of ammunition have been seized. Many rebel soldiers surrendered in droves after being surrounded by our army.

The Tibetan people are patriotic. Tibet already has a working class that resolutely demands liberation and a large number of patriotic and progressive figures from the upper and middle strata, as well as centrists, who support reform.

The rapid suppression of the Lhasa rebellion shows that the Tibetan traitorous group is bound to perish, and the future of the Tibetan people is bright. This is primarily because the Tibetan people are patriotic, they support the Central People's Government, love the People's Liberation Army, and oppose imperialism and traitorous elements. Tibet (including the three regions of Qamdo, Tsang, and √ú-Tsang) has a population of 1.2 million, while the rebels number only about 20,000, the majority of whom participated because they were deceived or coerced, and also include some rebels who fled from the former Xikang Province east of the Jinsha River, the so-called Khampas. The vast majority of the Tibetan people are extremely poor farmers and herdsmen who urgently hope to be liberated from the darkest feudal serf system in the world. There are also many patriotic and progressive people in the upper and middle strata of Tibet who support the central government, oppose the rebellion, and advocate democratically reforming the unreasonable social system so that Tibet can gradually become a civilized and progressive place. In this way, Tibet already has a working class that resolutely demands liberation, and a large number of patriotic and progressive figures from the upper and middle strata, as well as centrists, who support reform. The current task is, first of all, to quell the rebellion and establish a peaceful order. In this process, the central government's policy towards the rebel elements is: the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced will not be held accountable, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. The central government has instructed the People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet to broadly unite with all Tibetan compatriots who have not participated in the rebellion, to be responsible for protecting the lives and property of people from all walks of life in Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, commerce, politics, and religion, to respect the people's customs and religious beliefs, to protect lama temples and cultural relics, and to safeguard the interests of the masses and social order. Retaliation, injury, and insult are strictly prohibited towards prisoners of war and all enemies who have laid down their weapons.

The Chinese government believes that the relationship between China and its southwestern neighbors, and first of all between our country and the great friendly nation of the Republic of India, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were first proposed in the Agreement Between China and India on Trade and Intercourse Between the Tibet Region of China and India, signed on April 29, 1954. Now and in the future, for the fundamental interests of both countries, there is no reason for either side not to adhere to these principles to the end. Chinese government officials welcome the statement made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on March 23 regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs, considering this statement to be friendly. The Chinese side has never interfered in India's internal affairs, nor has it discussed India's internal affairs in the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee, and believes that it is impolite and inappropriate to conduct such discussions on the internal affairs of a friendly country.

Ali in the west of Lhasa, Gyantse, Phari, and Yatung in the southwest of Lhasa, Damxung and Heihe in the north of Lhasa, Zedang in the south of Lhasa, and Tsetang, Nyingchi, Zhamu, Dingqing, Qamdo, and Chayu in the east of Lhasa, are all under the firm control of the People's Liberation Army.

In order to thoroughly eliminate the bandits, the State Council has ordered the PLA troops stationed in Tibet to implement military control in various parts of Tibet. The tasks of the military control committee are to suppress the rebellion; protect the people; protect foreign nationals who abide by Chinese law; and, entrusted by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, organize administrative organs at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region and organize the self-defense forces of the patriotic people of Tibet to replace the corrupt, rebellious, and combat-ineffective old Tibetan army, which numbers only more than 3,000 people. The Military Control Committee of Lhasa City was announced on March 23. Military control committees in other regions will also be established one after another, with the exception of Shigatse, the capital of the post-Tibet region led by Panchen Erdeni, where there is no need to establish one. The Lhasa and local military control committees are composed jointly of representatives of the People's Liberation Army and representatives of the local patriotic people. Ali in the west of Lhasa, Gyantse, Phari, and Yatung in the southwest of Lhasa, Damxung and Heihe in the north of Lhasa, Zedang in the south of Lhasa, and Tsetang, Nyingchi, Zhamu, Dingqing, Qamdo, and Chayu in the east of Lhasa, are all under the firm control of the People's Liberation Army, and the vast majority of the local people are cooperating closely with the People's Liberation Army. The places where the bandits are active are only some very remote areas.

In view of the fact that Dalai Lama, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, is still being held hostage, the State Council has decided that Panchen Erdeni, the Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, will serve as the Acting Chairman of the Committee during the period when the Dalai Lama is being held hostage. The State Council also appointed Phabala Zhuolie Langjie Living Buddha and Ape Awang Jinmei, members of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, as Vice Chairmen, with Ape also serving concurrently as Secretary-General. In various parts of Tibet, as soon as order is restored, local administrative organs at all levels of the Tibet Autonomous Region will be established one after another, and the exercise of autonomous powers will begin. In the current period, the autonomous system and the military control system of the People's Liberation Army will operate concurrently. With the suppression of the rebellion and the establishment of a peaceful order, the autonomous system will gradually completely replace the military control system.

Due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page in the history of Tibet is unfolding.

Due to the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary forces and the failure of the rebellion, a new page in the history of Tibet is unfolding. It can now be concluded that the imperialist elements and the Tibetan reactionary forces completely misjudged the situation in Tibet. Contrary to their wishes, the rebellion they launched in Tibet did not cause the division and regression of the motherland, but promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unity, the destruction of Tibetan reactionary forces, the democratization of Tibet, and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.
