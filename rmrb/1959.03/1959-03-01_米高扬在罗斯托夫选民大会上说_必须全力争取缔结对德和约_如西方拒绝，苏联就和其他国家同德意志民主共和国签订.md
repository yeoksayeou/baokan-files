Xinhua News Agency, Rostov, 28th: TASS reports from Rostov: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan said at the Rostov electoral meeting on February 26 that every effort must now be made to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and resolve the Berlin issue. Mikoyan pointed out that Western countries have always maintained that so-called free elections are the only way to restore German unity. It seems that they are now beginning to abandon this position. Referring to the recent proposals of Western countries, Mikoyan pointed out that the two Germanies—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—can have equal rights in negotiations. This is not a concession to us, but a concession to reason. Life itself requires this.

Mikoyan emphasized that the issue of restoring German unity is entirely a matter for the Germans themselves. Some people are attempting to use a foreign ministers' conference to replace a meeting of heads of government in order to delay the meeting.

Mikoyan said that if Western countries are unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, it will be impossible to resolve the issue of turning West Berlin into a free city, and then the Soviet Union will have to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic along with other countries. Mikoyan emphasized that this would be a legitimate treaty and a major contribution to the cause of peace.

Referring to Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, Mikoyan said that the initial feeling was that the British Prime Minister was seeking mutually acceptable ways to resolve important issues. He showed initiative and put forward a series of proposals on issues such as trade and cultural exchanges. Mikoyan said that, of course, we also made the same efforts. Mikoyan said that Macmillan's talks with Khrushchev had a useful exchange of views and indicated the attitudes of both sides. But later, when it came to the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue, the Prime Minister may have been constrained to a certain extent by his allies and chose a stubborn course. Mikoyan said that Macmillan remained silent on Khrushchev's proposal to sign a British-Soviet non-aggression treaty, even though this was what the British Prime Minister himself had previously advocated.

    米高扬在罗斯托夫选民大会上说
    必须全力争取缔结对德和约
    如西方拒绝，苏联就和其他国家同德意志民主共和国签订
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社罗斯托夫讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬2月26日在罗斯托夫选民大会上发表演说时说，现在必须竭尽全力来缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题。米高扬指出，西方国家一直主张所谓自由选举是恢复德国统一的唯一道路，看来，现在它们开始放弃这种立场了。米高扬在谈到西方国家最近的建议时指出，两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以在谈判中有平等权利，这不是对我们让步，而是对理智让步，生活本身要求这样做。
    米高扬强调指出，恢复德国统一的问题完全是德国人自己的事。有人企图用外长会议来代替政府首脑的会谈，这是为了拖延会谈。
    米高扬说，如果西方国家不愿意缔结对德和约，也就不可能解决把西柏林变成自由城市的问题，那么苏联就不得不同其他国家一道同德意志民主共和国签订和约。米高扬强调说，这将是合法的条约，并且是对和平事业的重大贡献。
    在谈到麦克米伦在苏联的访问时，米高扬说，最初的感觉是英国首相在谋求双方可以接受的解决重要问题的途径。他表现了主动性，并且就贸易和文化交往等问题提出了一系列建议。米高扬说，当然，我们也作了同样的努力。米高扬说，麦克米伦同赫鲁晓夫的会谈中有益地交换了意见和表明了双方的态度。但是后来，谈到对德和约问题和柏林问题时，首相可能是受到了他的盟国方面的一定牵制，选择了固执的路线。米高扬说，麦克米伦对赫鲁晓夫关于签订英苏互不侵犯条约的建议采取了沉默的态度，尽管这是英国首相自己以前所主张的。
