    Completing the Seven-Year Plan in Three Years
    – On Meat Production in the Soviet Union’s Ryazan Oblast
    By Our Correspondent Chen Quanbi

    It was already midday when we arrived in Ryazan. Although Ryazan is only over two hundred kilometers from Moscow, it has more of a local flavor. The golden dome of the majestic small Kremlin shines in the sunlight, with a unique charm. Ryazan is the hometown of famous Russian scientists Pavlov, Michurin, the initial inventor of rockets Tsiolkovsky, and the poet Yesenin.

    High-Flying Spring Swallows

    Comrade Khrushchev compared the new pledges made by Ryazan Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Stavropol Krai, and Rostov Oblast this year in meat production, and the competition between them, to the first spring swallows flying freely in the Soviet sky this year, predicting a great harvest in Soviet livestock production this year.

    More than a month ago, while the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was still in session, Comrade Larionov, First Secretary of the Ryazan Oblast Party Committee, made a solemn pledge on the podium of the solemn 21st National Congress: Their oblast would complete the Seven-Year Plan for meat production in two or three years, and would sell 150,000 tons of meat to the state this year. Their grand determination and strong will to build communism won prolonged and warm applause from all those present at the time.

    Visiting Ryazan Oblast, one will deeply feel that people have been mobilized for the task of increasing meat production. Everywhere on the streets and in the collective farms, large slogans for increasing meat production by 150,000 tons seem to be laughing at you. The slogan "Youths, go to the cowshed! Go to the pigsty!" is also visible everywhere. The enthusiasm of the people of Ryazan to complete the Seven-Year Plan in three years in meat production is truly boiling.

    Tripling Production in One Year

    This year, Ryazan Oblast's meat production will increase by nearly three times compared to 1958, and 150,000 tons will be sold to the state. What a speed of increase this is! Compared with the situation of Ryazan's animal husbandry before the September Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee in 1953, there is a world of difference. At that time, although Ryazan Oblast had many usable pastures on both banks of the Oka River, the public animal husbandry was not developed, and the meat supply for collective farmers partly relied on Moscow. In just five short years, thanks to the Party's correct policy on animal husbandry, Ryazan Oblast has changed into another appearance today.

    To complete the Seven-Year Plan in three years in meat production, the most important thing is, of course, to accelerate the increase in the number of livestock. This year, the oblast plans to raise one million pigs and 190,000 calves; this can produce 90,000 tons of pork and 45,000 tons of beef. To solve the problem of piglets, the oblast plans to raise 150,000 sows this year. The source of calves is purchasing from collective farmers, state farms, and workers and staff of factories. Sheep, poultry, and rabbits are also a major source of increased meat production. This year, it is planned to sell 150,000 sheep, and rabbit meat is expected to reach 2,600 tons.

    In addition to accelerating the development of livestock numbers, thoroughly solving the livestock feed problem is also a central link in whether this year's meat production increase task can be completed. This year, Ryazan Oblast is preparing to vigorously expand the planting area of feed, especially the planting area of corn. Khrushchev especially emphasized this at the mass rally awarding the Order of Lenin to Ryazan Oblast. He said: "Corn is the tank in the hands of the soldiers (referring to the collective farm members), this tank enables us to overcome all difficulties and remove obstacles on the road to building abundant meat products for our people. Therefore, I call on you to be friends with corn. Whoever can be good friends with corn can open up a path for themselves to increase meat and milk production." This year, Ryazan Oblast is preparing to plant 100,000 hectares of corn, striving for an average harvest of 400 quintals per hectare, so that each cow can get 15 tons of green fodder.

    In completing this year's meat production increase task, the cadre issue is also a major issue. If a strong and organized cadre is not invested in animal husbandry, it will be difficult to complete such a large task. Oblast Party Secretary Larionov told us that in order to solve the unified leadership problem of the oblast's animal husbandry production, the Oblast Party Committee has now specifically appointed a secretary to be responsible for meat production in the future. This secretary has carried out a series of organizational work since last December, holding various meetings of the oblast, agricultural villages, agrotechnicians, and economic accounting personnel. In order to complete this major entrustment of the Party, he himself personally goes down to districts and agricultural villages almost every day to urge and inspect. Some new adjustments have also been made in the cadres at the level of district Party committee secretaries and district Soviet chairmen. Now the first and second secretaries of the district Party committee and the chairmen of the district Soviets are mostly young cadres around 35 years old. They are energetic and dare to think and act. In addition, new adjustments have also been made to the directors or work team leaders of the livestock farms. Larionov said that now the cadre lineup on the animal husbandry front is strong, coupled with improved livestock management and the promotion of scientific fattening methods, Ryazan Oblast has the conditions to complete this year's huge task.

    Everyone Takes Action

    Oblast Party Secretary Larionov said well that such a huge and urgent task cannot be completed without mobilizing all the people and doing the most arduous and complex organizational work. Ryazan Oblast started from this point, closely combining economic tasks with the Party's political and ideological work, and combining everyone with the Party's most urgent economic tasks through repeated publicity and mobilization. For example, in Ryazan, the center of the oblast, the streets and alleys are full of slogans for completing the meat production increase task. Open the oblast newspaper and see that almost every day in February the news of meat production is used as the front-page headline. In one month, the newspaper continuously introduced the advanced experience of breeders from various collective farms and published the advanced deeds of advanced figures on the animal husbandry front. For example, the deeds of Kovlova, an old milkmaid from the "Socialist Cornerstone" collective farm, published in the newspaper, are very touching. This milkmaid is a 67-year-old lady who originally planned to retire this year, but after the task of increasing meat and milk production was proposed, she insisted on joining this glorious battle with everyone. In a letter to the newspaper, she said: "I am already 67 years old. Frankly, I have decided to retire after doing what I should do in 1958. I have fulfilled my plan, increasing the milk yield per cow from 8,000 kilograms to 8,615 kilograms. I won first place in the oblast competition, so I am ready to retire. But after Ryazan Oblast proposed a new task in meat production, I had a new idea. I think it is not appropriate to retire at such a time. I can still work for another year and should contribute my share to the cause of winning a common victory."

    Since January this year, the Party's propagandists and reporters in this oblast have conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda in conjunction with the current new tasks. School teachers and students, and even doctors who go to the countryside to see patients, have also conducted propaganda and explanation work in conjunction with their own work. At the end of April this year, the oblast's theater troupe will also conduct a tour of various agricultural villages in conjunction with the current central task. After this series of in-depth ideological mobilization, it can be said that everyone in Ryazan Oblast has been mobilized, especially the youth. Since the end of January, 40,000 young people in the oblast have responded to the Party's call and bravely embarked on the animal husbandry production front. In February, another 7,000 young people went to work in cowsheds and pigsties. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in some agricultural villages have all signed up to participate in animal husbandry production. In addition, in some schools, students and teachers have also spontaneously organized poultry farms, rabbit farms, and cowsheds. They are also contributing their strength to respond to the Party's call. (Attached picture)

    三年完成七年计划
    ——记苏联梁赞州的肉类大生产
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    我们到达梁赞的时候，已是中午时分。梁赞虽然离莫斯科不过二百多公里，但它却有着更多的地方色彩。巍峨的小克里姆林宫的金顶在阳光下闪闪发光，别有一番风味。梁赞是俄罗斯著名科学家巴甫洛夫、米丘林、火箭的最初发明人齐奥尔科夫斯基和诗人叶赛宁的故乡。
    春燕高飞
    赫鲁晓夫同志把梁赞州、莫斯科州、斯塔夫罗波尔边区、罗斯托夫州今年在肉类生产上提出的新的保证和它们之间的相互竞赛，比作是今年在苏联天空中第一批飞出的春燕，他们自由地飞翔，预报着苏联今年在畜牧业生产上将获得大丰收。
    一个多月以前，在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会还在进行的日子里，梁赞州州委第一书记拉里昂诺夫同志，就在庄严的第二十一次代表大会的讲坛上，发出庄严的保证：他们这个州在肉类生产上要在两三年内完成七年计划，今年要向国家交售十五万吨肉类。他们的雄伟的决心和建设共产主义的坚强的意志，博得了当时全体到会者的长时间的热烈的鼓掌。
    到梁赞州看看，就会深深感到人们都已为肉类增产的任务而动员起来了。随便在哪条街道和哪个集体农庄，为增产十五万吨肉类的大幅标语，好像总是在向你发出欢笑。“青年们，到牛棚去！到猪舍去！”的口号，也是到处可见。梁赞人在肉类生产上要用三年完成七年计划的热情，真是已经沸腾起来了。
    一年增产三倍
    今年梁赞州的肉类生产要比1958年增加将近三倍，要给国家交售十五万吨肉。这是怎样的增产速度啊！如果拿1953年苏共中央九月全会以前梁赞畜牧业的情形来比，真是有天壤之别。那时梁赞州在奥卡河两岸虽有许多可以利用的牧场，但公有畜牧业是不发达的，集体农民的肉类供应有一部分还要依靠莫斯科。只是短短五年的时间，由于党对畜牧业政策的正确，梁赞州今天就变成了另外一副样子。
    要在肉类生产上三年完成七年计划，最重要的当然是加速增加牲畜的头数。在今年内，全州计划饲养一百万头猪、十九万头小牛；这样可以生产猪肉九万吨、牛肉四万五千吨。为了解决猪崽的问题，全州今年计划饲养十五万头母猪。小牛的来源则是向集体农民、国营农场和工厂的工人、职员购买。羊、家禽、家兔也是增产肉类的一大来源。今年准备要交售十五万头羊，家兔肉要达到二千六百吨。
    除了加速发展牲畜的头数外，彻底解决牲畜的饲料问题也是能否完成今年肉类增产任务的一个中心环节。梁赞州今年准备大力扩大饲料的种植面积，特别是玉蜀黍的种植面积。赫鲁晓夫在授予梁赞州列宁勋章的群众大会上曾特别强调了这点。他说：“玉蜀黍是战士们（指集体农庄庄员）手中的坦克，这种坦克使我们有可能克服一切困难、搬掉在为我国人民建立丰裕肉产品道路上的障碍。因此我号召你们去同玉蜀黍作朋友，谁要能同玉蜀黍要好，谁就能够为自己开辟增加肉类和牛奶产量的道路。”梁赞州今年准备种十万公顷玉蜀黍，每公顷争取平均收获四百公担，这样，每头牛可得十五吨青饲料。
    在完成今年肉类的增产任务上，干部问题也是一个大问题，假使畜牧业中不投入一批强有力的和有组织才干的干部，要完成这样大的任务也是困难的。州委书记拉里昂诺夫对我们说，为了解决州畜牧业生产的统一领导问题，州委会现在专门指定一位书记来负责今后的肉类生产，这位书记从去年12月后就进行了一系列的组织工作，开了州的、农庄的、农艺人员的、经济核算人员的各种会议，而他本人为了要完成党的这种重大的付托，差不多每天都亲自下区下农庄去进行督促检查，在区委书记和区苏维埃主席一级的干部中，也作了某些新的调整，现在区委第一、第二书记和区苏维埃主席，大半是三十五岁左右的青年干部，他们精力充沛，敢想敢做。另外，对养畜场的主任或工作队长，也进行了新的调整。拉里昂诺夫说，现在畜牧业战线上干部的阵容是强的，再加上改善牲畜的管理，推广科学的育肥方法，完成梁赞州今年的巨大任务，是具备了条件的。
    人人动手
    州委书记拉里昂诺夫说得好，这样巨大这样急迫的任务，不发动全体人民，不作最艰苦复杂的组织工作是完不成的。梁赞州就从这一点出发，把经济任务和党的政治思想工作紧密地结合了起来，通过反复的宣传鼓动把每一个人与党的最急迫的经济任务结合了起来。例如在州中心梁赞，满街满巷都挂满了为完成肉类增产任务的口号。打开州的报纸看看，2月份差不多每天都把肉类生产的消息作为一版头条消息。报纸在一个月中，连续介绍了各个集体农庄饲养员的先进经验，刊出了一些在畜牧业战线上先进人物的先进事迹。例如，报上发表的“社会主义基石”集体农庄老挤奶员科夫洛娃的事迹，就是十分感动人的。这位挤奶员是六十七岁的老太太，她今年本来准备退休，但增产肉类和牛奶的任务提出后，她一定要和大家一道投入这一个光荣的战斗中去。她在写给报社的一封信上说：“我已经是六十七岁的人了，坦白地讲，我已决定在1958年做到我应做的事以后退休。我实现了我的计划，每头奶牛的挤奶量从八千公斤提高到八千六百十五公斤，在州的竞赛中我得了第一，因此准备退休。但当梁赞州在肉类生产上提出新的任务以后，我又产生了一个新的念头，我想在这样的时期退休是不适时的，我还能工作一年，应该把自己的一份力量投到争取共同胜利的事业中去。”
    从今年1月份起，这个州的党的宣传员、报告员都结合着目前的新任务进行了广泛深入的宣传，学校的教员和学生，甚至下乡看病的医生，也都结合了本身的业务进行了宣传解释工作。今年4月底，州的剧团也要结合目前中心任务到各个农庄去进行巡回演出。经过这一系列的深入的思想动员，现在梁赞州的人真可说是个个都动员起来了，特别是青年人。从1月下旬起，全州就有四万青年响应党的号召勇敢地走上了畜牧业生产战线，2月份又有七千青年去到牛棚和猪舍工作。有些农庄的共产党员和共青团员，则全部报名要求参加畜牧业生产。此外，在一些学校里，学生和教员们也自动组织了养禽场、养兔房和牛棚，他们也在为响应党的这个号召而贡献出自己的力量。（附图片）
