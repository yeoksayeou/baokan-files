    Sketches of Kashgar
    Ruan Jiatai

    At the end of last year, we crossed the Tianshan Mountains from Urumqi to reach Kashgar, a major town in southern Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, it was already a vast world of frozen rivers and thousands of miles of snow. However, in the fields of Kashgar, one could still see the lush green winter wheat, and groups of farmers, singing songs, were busy applying fertilizer and covering the winter wheat with soil. The fruit stands all over the streets gave one the feeling of early summer. After walking and getting hot, eating a piece of emerald green and ice-cold cantaloupe, or a watermelon with bright red flesh, peeling open a pomegranate as bright as a ruby, and gently sucking the sweet juice, who would think that it was winter?
    Kashgar is an ancient city with a history of over a thousand years. In the tenth century AD, it became the second capital of the then Uyghur Kara-Khanid dynasty. The entire city is centered on the Aitika Square, where the Great Id Kah Mosque is located, and radiates in all directions. The street leading from the square to the north gate is called Aizhanrester, lined with shops and crowded with pedestrians. It has always been the largest street in the city. But now, compared with the newly opened streets after liberation, it seems so narrow and shabby. When we first arrived, we wandered around the city several times and didn't even know there was such a street. Later we learned that this was the largest street in the past.
    Where there used to be small adobe houses and winding narrow alleys, magnificent libraries, cinemas, and department stores have now been built. On the wide and straight roads, buses, trucks, and cars race by. On the sidewalks on both sides of the road, rows of poplar trees are planted. Until twelve o'clock at night, there are still many Uyghur youths strolling on these roads, playing the "Dutar" and singing loudly.
    At an exhibition, we were attracted by a panoramic plan of Kashgar City. The suburbs from Kashgar to Shule (here Kashgar is usually called Huicheng, and Shule is called Hancheng, the two cities are about ten miles apart, with buses) will become an industrial zone, and light boats will float on the beautiful Kashgar River.
    The Kashgar River basin and the nearby Yarkand River basin are rich in cotton. Makit County is a well-known high-yield cotton county in the country. However, in the past, the cotton cloth used by the people here had to be transported from distant places. Now, a cotton mill with 100,000 spindles is under construction and will be put into production next year. The majority of farmers will be able to wear cloth woven from local cotton.
    Currently, it is the busy season for spring plowing preparations. Almost everyone in the city is involved in the manure accumulation craze. Cadres, shop clerks, middle school students, and Young Pioneers, everyone carries a manure basket in their hands, and they can pick up manure at any time when they go to work, go to school, or walk on the road. Housewives are also very enthusiastic about accumulating manure. I often see them lined up neatly, singing songs, and setting off to accumulate manure. A comrade from a street office told me that the housewives here are not only enthusiastic about accumulating manure, but also perform very well in iron smelting and factory operation. Now there are also many housewives smelting oil in the high mountains far from the city. They are prepared to do it for a long time, and are planning to build larger and more factories.
    Every time I see those spirited women's teams, marching forward and singing loudly, I can't help but feel excited. These are the Uyghur women who have been veiled and unseen for thousands of years! They have now thrown off their dark veils, picked up the cleaning rods, lifted the mud buckets, and carried the manure baskets, freely and actively working in front of the iron smelting furnaces, construction sites, streets, and fields. Not only can they decide their own affairs, but they also participate in the management of the entire commune, city, and even the country in people's communes and government agencies. How can they not sing? How can their enthusiasm not be great?
    The sun shines on the Kashgar River, the river water sparkles with golden light, and the ancient city of Kashgar for thousands of years is advancing like the river, shining with the light of youth like the rising sun.

    喀什噶尔散记
    阮家泰
    去年年底，我们从乌鲁木齐翻越天山来到南疆重镇——喀什噶尔。在北疆，早已是千里冰封、万里雪飘的茫茫世界了，可是喀什噶尔的田野里，还可以看到葱绿的冬麦，成群的农民，一边唱着歌，一边在给冬麦追肥盖土。街头遍设的瓜果摊更给人以初夏的感觉，走路走热了，吃一角翠绿冰凉的甜瓜，或是大红瓤的西瓜，剥开一个红宝石般鲜艳的石榴，轻轻吸吮那甜美的液汁，谁还能想到这是冬天？
    喀什噶尔是一个古老的城市，建城已有一千多年的历史。在公元十世纪时，它已成为当时回鹘哈喇汗朝的第二首都。整个城市以大礼拜寺所在的艾提卡广场为中心，向四面八方成辐射形，从广场通向北门的一条街叫艾占热斯特，店铺林立，行人拥挤，一向是全城最大的一条街。但是现在，跟那些解放后新开辟的街道相比，它显得那么窄小寒伧。我们刚来时，在城里逛了好几次，还不知道有这么一条街，后来才知道这就是过去最大的街道了。
    在以前是矮小土房和弯曲窄巷的地方，如今盖起了宏伟壮丽的图书馆、电影院、百货大楼，又宽又直的马路上，奔驰着公共汽车、大卡车和小汽车，马路两旁的人行道上，栽植着成排的白杨树，直到深夜十二点钟，还有不少维吾尔族青年在这些路上散步，弹着“都塔尔”引亢高歌。
    在一个展览会上，我们被一幅喀什市远景规划图吸引住了。从喀什到疏勒（这里习惯把喀什叫做回城，疏勒叫做汉城，两城相距约十余里，有公共汽车）的郊区将要成为一片工业区，美丽的喀什噶尔河上将会泛起片片轻舟。
    喀什噶尔河流域和附近的叶尔羌河流域都盛产棉花，麦盖提县是全国有名的棉花高产县。但是过去这里人民穿用的棉布都要从遥远的外地运进来。现在，一个十万纱锭的棉纺厂正在建设中，明年就可以投入生产。广大农民都可以穿上用本地棉花自织的布了。
    目前，正是春耕准备的紧张时节，几乎全城的人都卷入了积肥热潮，机关干部、商店职员、中学生、少先队员，人人手里提着个粪篮，去办公、上学、走在路上随时都可以拾粪。家庭妇女，积肥劲头也很大，我常常看见她们整整齐齐排着队，唱着歌，出发去积肥。一个街道办事处的同志告诉我，这里的家庭妇女不但积肥劲头大，而且在炼铁、办工厂中也表现得非常出色，现在还有很多家庭妇女在远离城市的高山上炼石油，她们准备长期干下去，而且正在计划办更大更多的工业。
    每次，当我看到那些英姿焕发，高歌挺进的妇女队伍时，我总抑制不住内心的激动。这就是千百年来盖着面纱、不见天日的维吾尔妇女！她们现在抛掉了黑沉沉的面纱，拿起了通条、提起了泥桶、背起了粪筐，自由自在地活跃在炼铁炉前，建筑工地上，街道上和田野里；她们不但自己可以决定自己的事情，而且还在人民公社、政府机关里参与管理全社、全市以至全国的大事。她们怎么能不歌唱？她们的劲头怎么能不大？
    朝阳照在喀什噶尔河上，河水闪耀金光，千年的古城喀什噶尔像河水一样奔流前进，像朝阳一样闪射着青春的光芒。
