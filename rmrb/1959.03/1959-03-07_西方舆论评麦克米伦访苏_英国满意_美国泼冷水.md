Western Opinion on Macmillan's Visit to the Soviet Union
Britain Satisfied, United States Pouring Cold Water

(Reported by this newspaper) Western countries' opinions on the Soviet-British joint communiqué show that the results of Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union have caused divisions between the United States and Britain, as well as between Britain and West Germany and France.

According to Reuters, the British press is "generally satisfied" with Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. The "Daily Mirror" believes that the visit achieved some beneficial results on issues such as the German question, the limitation of troops and armaments in certain areas of Europe, and the promotion of trade between the two countries. Many influential British newspapers particularly emphasized Britain's current position among Western countries. The "News Chronicle," in an article entitled "Macmillan is Now the Leader of the West," bluntly stated that Macmillan, after returning to London, "directly assumed the responsibility of leading the West."

American newspapers and government officials have tried to downplay the significance of the Soviet-British communiqué and have put forward opinions different from those in British public opinion. In a press conference on March 4, Eisenhower openly admitted that there were differences of opinion between the United States and Britain on certain issues. In his speech, Eisenhower was unwilling to make too many speculations about Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. According to Reuters, Eisenhower's hesitations "surprised" many observers. The Reuters dispatch also said that another "surprising" thing was that Eisenhower clearly stated in his speech that Britain's opinion on the issue of negotiations with the Soviet Union on banning nuclear weapons testing was "different from the opinions expressed by the United States." Eisenhower also said that Britain's views "do not convince us that they are entirely feasible." In response to a reporter's question about whether the leadership of the West had been transferred to Britain due to Dulles' illness, Eisenhower said, "I never thought that such things were entirely determined by individuals." He also emphasized that "the current position of the United States in the Western world is different from that of any other country. Because of this position, the policies, statements, and actions of the United States are very important. This is the factor that makes the United States the leader of the entire free world." Many foreign news agencies pointed out in their reports on Eisenhower's speech that this showed that "differences have begun to emerge" between the United States and Britain. Associated Press reporter Hightower listed the points of divergence between the United States and Britain: Macmillan has a "strong interest" in a high-level East-West meeting, "but the President has once again criticized the idea of holding a summit meeting under the current circumstances"; on the issue of a restricted armaments zone in Europe, Macmillan is prepared to consider it, but Eisenhower believes that this is an issue that can only be discussed after real progress has been made on difficult issues such as the German question; on the issue of trade, the Anglo-Soviet communiqué encourages the increase of trade between the two countries, while the United States still refuses to purchase Soviet products of all kinds.

United Press International reported: "The statement that Britain and Russia have agreed to study the withdrawal of some troops and nuclear weapons obviously surprised some Western capitals" and "has the potential to cause disputes among Western allies." In particular, West Germany is most opposed to the plan to establish a "restricted armaments" zone in Central Europe. Reuters said: "The West German government has never been enthusiastic about the plan for disengagement in Europe." According to foreign reports, in the secret talks between Adenauer and de Gaulle in Paris on March 4, in order to strengthen the Franco-West German axis and adhere to a "tough attitude," the section on "restricted armaments" zones in the Soviet-British communiqué was also emphasized. Although the content of the talks was not made public, the British "Daily Telegraph" has now revealed that there are differences between the British side and the French and West German sides on how to take action on European issues in the future.

### 西方舆论评麦克米伦访苏  英国满意　美国泼冷水

    西方舆论评麦克米伦访苏
    英国满意　美国泼冷水
    本报讯　西方国家舆论对苏英会谈公报的评论表明，麦克米伦访苏的结果，已在美英之间以及英国和西德、法国之间引起了分歧。
    据路透社报道，英国报纸对于麦克米伦访苏之行“普遍感到满意”。“每日镜报”认为这次访问使关于德国问题、在欧洲一定地区限制军队和军备以及增进两国贸易等问题上取得了一些有益的结果。不少英国有势力的报纸特别强调了目前英国在西方国家中所居的地位。“新闻纪事报”在一篇以“现在麦克米伦是西方领袖了”为题的文章中直率地说：麦克米伦回到伦敦后“直接了当地就担负起西方领导的责任”。
    美国报纸和政府人士则竭力贬低苏英公报的意义，并提出了与英国舆论界不同的意见。3月4日艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上的谈话公开承认美英在某些意见上存在着不同的看法。艾森豪威尔在谈话中不愿对这次麦克米伦访苏作过多的推测。据路透社说，艾森豪威尔的这种犹豫态度使得很多观察家“感到惊奇”。路透社的电讯中还说“令人惊奇”的另一件事情是：艾森豪威尔在谈话中明白表示在就禁止核武器试验与苏联的谈判问题上，英国同“美国表明的意见不同”。艾森豪威尔并且说，英国的意见“不能使我们确信它们是完全可行的。”在回答记者提出的关于目前由于杜勒斯生病，西方领导权已转到英国手里的问题时，艾森豪威尔说：“我从来不认为这种事情完全决定于个人”。他并且强调说：“在西方世界中美国目前的地位不同于其他任何国家的地位，由于这种地位，美国的政策、言论和行动都是很重要的，这就是使美国成为整个自由世界的领导者的因素。”许多外国通讯社在报道艾森豪威尔的谈话时指出，这显示了美英之间“开始出现了分歧”。美联社记者海托华并列举了美英的分歧之点：麦克米伦对东西方高级会谈一事有“浓厚的兴趣”，“然而总统却再一次抨击在目前情况下召开最高级会议的主张”；在欧洲限制军备区问题上，麦克米伦准备考虑，但艾森豪威尔却认为这是在像德国问题这样困难的问题上获得真正进展之后才可以商讨的一个问题；在贸易问题上，英苏公报鼓励两国贸易的增加，而美国却仍拒绝购买苏联各色产品。
    合众国际社报道说：“关于英国和俄国已同意研究部分军队和核武器撤出的声明显然使某些西方国家的首都感到意外”，并且“有引起西方盟国之间的争论的可能”。特别是西德反对建立中欧“军备限制”区计划最厉害。路透社说：“西德政府对于欧洲脱离接触的计划一直不热心”。据外电报道，在3月4日阿登纳为了加强法—西德轴心、坚持“强硬态度”而到巴黎和戴高乐进行的秘密会谈中，也着重讨论了苏英公报中“关于限制军备”区的部分。虽然会谈内容没有公开，但是现在英国“每日电讯报”已经透露：关于今后如何采取有关欧洲问题的行动，英国一方和法国及西德一方是有分歧的。
