Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 4th. The National Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology Experience Exchange Meeting was recently held in Wuchang. The meeting summarized the achievements of surveying and mapping work over the past nine years, extensively exchanged experiences, and discussed the guiding principles and tasks for the future development of surveying and mapping.

Over the past nine years, under the leadership of the Party, China's surveying and mapping industry has achieved rapid development. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of last year, China's surveying and mapping staff have completed enormous tasks. In terms of geodetic surveying, the total length of first-order triangulation completed was more than 46,000 kilometers, accounting for 72% of the total task to be completed nationwide; first and second-order precision leveling was more than 64,000 kilometers, accounting for 60.8% of the total task to be completed nationwide. In addition, a large number of second and third-order triangulation networks and third and fourth-order leveling networks were surveyed. In terms of gravity surveying, the layout of basic national gravity points and first-order points with high precision has been basically completed. In terms of aerial surveying, the photographed area has reached more than 4.24 million square kilometers, accounting for 44.2% of the total area of the country. In terms of topographic surveying, not only was the plane table mapping area of various scales completed for about 2 million square kilometers, but also a huge amount of engineering surveying work was completed in coordination with various engineering constructions. In terms of map compilation, drawing, and printing, with the progress of surveying work, a large number of large-scale topographic maps and various small-scale maps have been completed. In terms of the accuracy of surveying operations, such as astronomical geodetic networks, precision leveling networks, gravity control networks, medium-scale aerial surveying technology, and map printing technology, have reached or approached advanced international levels.

The number of surveying and mapping personnel has also increased significantly in recent years, and a vanguard team of nearly 100,000 people has grown. This team is distributed in various industrial, agricultural, and transportation construction departments, undertaking various surveying and mapping tasks, and has made significant contributions to the general survey, exploration, planning, design, and construction of various projects.

Significant progress has also been made in surveying and mapping science and technology research. China has now successfully trial-produced and initially trial-produced radar measuring instruments, electro-optical rangefinders, precision theodolites, multi-projection instruments, and so on. The National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping has also established a radar surveying team, preparing to apply the world's most advanced electronics technology to surveying and mapping work. Investigations have also been carried out in the topographically complex Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and preparations are underway to use the latest technology for mapping. Mass technical innovations have also begun to form a climax. They have created a variety of mapping tools, rapid mapping methods, various one-step mapping methods for aerial surveying internal work, various simplified calculation tools and methods, as well as various types of targets and target-making tools, all of which have played a significant role in production.

While affirming the achievements of the past nine years, the conference also widely exchanged experiences through various large and small meetings. Experiences from various regions regarding technical management, inventions and creations, instrument and tool reforms, technical operation method improvements, and large-scale mass surveying work have been exchanged and promoted.

After discussion, the representatives attending the meeting believed that under the current situation of a comprehensive leap forward in national construction, where maps are urgently needed everywhere, surveying and mapping work must develop at a higher speed. It is necessary to implement the policy of "walking on two legs," implement a policy of simultaneous promotion of central and local surveying and mapping, simultaneous promotion of formal and simplified surveying and mapping in the surveying and mapping industry, adopt a policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale mapping, mobilize all surveying and mapping forces, adopt various mapping methods, and quickly meet the urgent need for surveying and mapping data for the great development of industry and agriculture. The meeting called on all surveying and mapping workers to continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, continue to promote the spirit of being practical, working hard, and working cleverly, make great efforts in technical revolution, engage in scientific research, attack cutting-edge technologies, carry out technical popularization work, hand over technology to the masses, vigorously promote advanced experiences, and launch a technical revolution climax on the surveying and mapping front. At the same time, the conference also called on all surveying and mapping workers to establish the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard," closely cooperate and support each other in their work, so that surveying and mapping work can leap forward in 1959 in a bigger, better, and more comprehensive way.

The meeting lasted for ten days and was attended by more than 1,400 people. The National Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology Innovation Exhibition was also held during the conference.

    高速度发展测绘工作满足建设急需
    全国测绘科学技术经验交流会总结成就确定任务
    新华社武汉4日电　全国测绘科学技术经验交流会议最近在武昌举行。会议总结了九年来测绘工作的成就，广泛地交流了经验，并且讨论了今后测绘事业发展的方针任务。
    九年来，我国测绘事业在党的领导下获得了迅速的发展。截至去年年底的不完全统计，我国测绘工作人员完成了巨大的任务。在大地测量方面，完成一等三角测量总长度四万六千多公里，占全国应完成总任务的72％；一、二等精密水准测量六万四千多公里，占全国应完成总任务60.8％。此外，还完成了大量的二、三等三角网和三、四等水准网的测量工作。在重力测量方面，基本上完成了精度很高的全国基本重力点和一级点的布设。在航空测量方面，摄影面积已达四百二十四万多平方公里，占全国总面积44.2％。在地形测量方面：不仅完成各种比例尺的平板仪测图面积约二百余万平方公里，还配合各项工程建设完成了巨大的工程测量工作。在地图编绘、制印等方面，随着测量工作的进展，完成了大量的大比例尺地形图和各种小比例尺的地图。从测量业务精度来看，如天文大地网、精密水准网、重力控制网、中等比例尺航空测量技术、地图制印技术，已达到或者接近国际先进水平。
    测绘工作人员的数量几年来也有了很大增长，一支拥有将近十万人的尖兵队伍已经成长起来。这支队伍分布在各个工业、农业、交通建设部门，担任着各种测绘工作，对各项建设的普查、勘探、规划、设计、施工作了重大的贡献。
    测绘科学技术研究工作也有很大进展，我国现在已经试制成功和初步试制成雷达测量仪、光速测距仪、精密经纬仪、多倍投影仪等等。国家测绘总局还建立了雷达测量队，准备把世界上最先进的电子学技术应用到测绘工作中去。对地形复杂的青藏高原地区也进行了考察，正在准备运用最新的技术进行测图。群众性的技术革新也开始形成高潮，他们创造了多种多样的绘图工具、快速成图法、航测内业的各种一次成图法、各种简化计算的工具和方法，以及各型觇标和造标工具等，都在生产上起了很大的作用。
    大会在肯定九年来的成就同时，还通过各种大、小会议广泛地交流了经验。各地有关技术管理、发明创造、仪器工具改革、技术作业方法改进和大搞群众测量工作等经验，都得到了交流和推广。
    出席会议的代表经过讨论后认为：在目前国家建设全面大跃进、到处需图很急的情况下，测绘工作必须以更高的速度发展，必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，在测绘事业上实行中央与地方测绘同时并举、正规与简易测绘同时并举，采取大、中、小比例尺测图相结合的方针，调动一切测绘力量，采用各种成图方法，尽快地满足工农业大发展对测绘资料的急迫需要。会议号召全体测绘工作者继续反对保守，破除迷信，发扬敢想敢说敢作的共产主义风格，继续发扬实干苦干巧干的精神，大闹技术革命，大搞科学研究，猛攻尖端技术，开展技术普及工作，把技术交给群众，大力推广先进经验，在测绘战线上掀起一个技术革命的高潮。同时，大会还号召全体测绘工作者树立起“全国一盘棋”的思想，工作中紧密协作，互相支援，使测绘工作在1959年更大更好更全面地跃进。
    会议进行了十天，有一千四百多人参加。全国测绘科学技术革新展览会也在会议期间展出。
