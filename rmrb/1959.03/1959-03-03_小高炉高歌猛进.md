Small Blast Furnaces Advance by Leaps and Bounds

The Anhui Provincial Conference on Small Blast Furnace Iron Smelting was held very timely.

Currently, a decisive measure for increasing the production of steel and steel products is to supply more pig iron to steelmaking furnaces, especially to key enterprises. The output of pig iron from small blast furnaces accounts for a considerable proportion of the national iron production plan this year and is a "heavy force" in fulfilling the target of 18 million tons of steel. While focusing on large blast furnaces, ensuring that small blast furnaces produce more and better iron is a matter of pressing urgency on the steel front.

To focus on small blast furnaces, the first priority is to expand their operating production rate. The key is to let them eat well and eat their fill. The output of coking coal must be increased, and the quality of coke must be improved. While striving to increase coal production, it is particularly important to seize the construction of simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens. The output of iron ore must also be increased. To transport coal and ore to the vicinity of small blast furnaces in a timely manner, it is necessary to strengthen transportation, especially short-distance transportation. Coal washing, coking, mining and other equipment needs to be supplied in complete sets in a timely manner. This series of tasks is complex and detailed, and in many places it is also a new topic, but as long as the local party committees pay attention to grasping it, it can certainly be done well.

For small blast furnaces themselves, we require high yield, high quality, and long life, while also paying attention to reducing costs. This requires mobilizing the masses to strengthen production management and improve production technology.

If all localities grasp small blast furnace production firmly, small blast furnaces can advance by leaps and bounds and make great contributions to the completion of the steel leap forward plan.

    小高炉高歌猛进
    安徽省小高炉炼铁会议开得很适时。
    当前增产钢和钢材的一项决定性措施，是供给炼钢炉、特别是重点企业的炼钢炉更多的生铁。小高炉的生铁产量在今年全国产铁计划中占相当大的比重，是完成一千八百万吨钢的一支“重兵”。在抓大高炉的同时，保证小高炉多出铁出好铁，是钢铁战线上的当务之急。
    抓小高炉，首先要扩大小高炉的开工生产率。关键是让它们吃饱吃好。焦煤产量要增加，焦炭质量要提高。在努力增加煤炭产量的同时，特别要抓紧简易洗煤厂和简易炼焦炉的建设工作。铁矿石的产量也要增加。煤和矿石要及时运到小高炉旁，就要加强运输、特别是短途运输。洗煤、炼焦、矿山等设备需要及时成套地供应。这一系列的工作是复杂细致的，在许多地方也是新的课题，但是只要各地党委注意抓，就一定能搞好。
    对小高炉本身，要求高产，高质，高寿，同时要注意降低成本。这就要发动群众加强生产管理，提高生产技术。
    各地都把小高炉生产狠狠地抓起来，小高炉就能高歌猛进，为完成钢铁跃进计划建树巨大的功勋。
