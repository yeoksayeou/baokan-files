Seek High Yields Through Measures, Safeguard High Yields With Measures
The People of Jinbei are Full of Confidence to Move from High Yields to Even Higher Yields

Our Newspaper Datong, March 6th Dispatch: The Jinbei Special Zone (formerly Yanbei, Jinxi Northwest regions, etc.) of Shanxi Province, which changed its historical face as a low-yield area during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, is now launching a campaign for higher grain crop yields this year with even greater enthusiasm and more effective measures than last year. The total grain output will increase from 4.1 billion jin last year to 6.5 billion jin. On the basis of a per-mu yield of 303 jin in basic farmland, a "thousand-jin movement" will be launched.

In February, after the Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a call to farmers throughout the region to launch a large-scale per-mu yield of a thousand jin movement, millions of people throughout the region quickly plunged into a high-yield competition movement centered on spring plowing. Since last winter, the average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu in the Jinbei region has reached 20,000 jin, and recently a "fertilizer decisive battle month" has been launched to accumulate another 10,000 jin of refined fertilizer per mu. While thousands of troops and horses were fighting the fertilizer battle, a large-scale movement to manufacture and repair agricultural tools was also launched. According to the needs of this year's production, 670,000 tools have been repaired, improved, and manufactured throughout the region. The work of realizing garden-style cultivation of basic farmland is also underway. An 80,000-person water conservancy professional team is fighting a large-scale battle for small-scale water conservancy projects that can benefit in the current year; and breaking with convention, measures such as ice-breaking irrigation are being taken to start spring watering a month earlier.

The Jinbei Special Zone is a well-known low-yield area in the country, with a vast area and sparse population, barren soil, and frequent natural disasters such as wind, drought, frost, and freezing. In addition, farmers inherit the traditional farming habit of extensive cultivation and low yields. Many cultivated lands often yield only dozens of jin per mu in good years and a dozen jin per mu in poor harvests. A year ago, some people still regarded a per-mu yield of a hundred jin of grain as impossible. Some people said that the agricultural development program target was four, five, eight hundred jin, and Jinbei could only be forty, fifty, eighty jin, believing that Jinbei's conditions were backward and it was impossible to achieve the agricultural development program target. However, after a year of the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Jinbei launched a struggle between two lines and two ideologies in agricultural production. After thoroughly breaking down conservative ideas, they generally changed from extensive cultivation and low yields to intensive cultivation and fine farming, implemented the basic farmland system, and combined it with agricultural technology reform. As a result, grain production in 1958 increased by more than double compared to 1957, and the average basic farmland yield reached 303 jin, more than two and a half times the average per-mu yield in 1957.

The Jinbei region's leap forward plan for this year was formulated by first finding measures and then setting targets. They first found ten major bases and favorable conditions for achieving higher yields this year. Relying on these bases, they enriched last year's measures and turned them into powerful measures to ensure higher yields this year. They are: First, the extensive cultivation and low-yield farming methods in the vast areas of Jinbei have been fundamentally changed after the preliminary implementation of the basic farmland system in 1958. In 1959, active and steady measures will be taken to further implement this system. The region has planned 9.46 million mu of basic grain fields as a base for achieving higher yields. Second, last autumn, the region cultivated a total of 10 million mu of land, of which nearly 2 million mu of basic farmland were deeply cultivated to three chi (one meter), and the rest were all above one chi (33 cm). This laid a good foundation for achieving higher yields this year. For this reason, it is necessary to further carry out mass soil surveys and improvement work, and catch up in terms of fertilizer, close planting, and land preparation. Third, last year's experience fully demonstrated the huge role of fertilizer in increasing production. This year, fertilizer accumulation and production work will greatly exceed last year. The average fertilizer application per mu of basic farmland in the region can reach 30,000 jin, and the quality of fertilizer will also be better than last year. Fourth, the great development of water conservancy construction in the region in 1958 played a huge role in transforming low yields into high yields. At present, the region has 8 million mu of irrigated land. With this year's projects, the region can reach 10 million mu of irrigated land. Efforts will be made to make 8 million mu of irrigated land into drought and flood-resistant and high-yielding cultivated land, with an average of two mu of good irrigated land per person in the region. Fifth, major crops in Jinbei all had large-scale high-yield records last year, which set benchmarks and provided experience for this year's high-yield movement. Based on these experiences, the Prefectural Committee has formulated new management plans for the region's six major crops, divided by crop and period. All counties use the new management measures for the six crops as the content to organize and train a large number of technicians. By implementing the six crop management programs, we will specifically implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and push cultivation management to a higher level. Sixth, promoting the experience of planting high-yield crops. This year, the region has determined to plant four million mu of potatoes, corn, and sorghum, accounting for 42% of the 9 million mu of grain fields, and the wheat field reaches 1.62 million mu, more than double the area of last year. Seventh, with the reform of the cultivation system, the Prefectural Committee decided to carry out a major reform of cultivation technology. This year, it is determined to initially realize garden-style cultivation of 3.54 million mu of cultivated land, requiring each mu to produce at least 1,500 jin. Eighth, last year the people of Jinbei basically controlled the late blight of potatoes, and found a set of laws, this year can ensure a bumper harvest of potatoes. Ninth, the people of Jinbei showed a high degree of diligence and bravery in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After strengthening socialist and communist education this year, they will continue to give play to the spirit of selfless labor. Tenth, after a year of the Great Leap Forward, the leadership experience of Party organizations at all levels has become richer. In 1959, it is required to closely combine leadership measures with mass movements and make work more in-depth and meticulous.

At present, focusing on measures and seeking high yields from measures has become the action slogan of the people of Jinbei. The Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires that grasping measures be implemented throughout the year, and measures be used to ensure the realization of high yields and even higher yields.

    向措施要高产用措施保高产
    晋北人民满怀信心要从高产走向更高产
    本报大同6日电　1958年大跃进中改变了低产区历史面貌的山西晋北专区（原雁北、晋西北等地区），正以比去年更大的干劲和更得力的措施，掀起了今年粮食作物高产更高产的运动。粮食总产量要从去年的四十一亿斤提高到六十五亿斤，基本农田亩产量在三百零三斤的基础上，开展千斤运动。
    2月间，中共晋北地委向全区农民发出了开展大面积亩产千斤运动的号召后，全区几百万人迅速地投入了以备耕为中心的高产竞赛运动。去冬以来，晋北区所积肥料每亩平均已达两万斤，最近又开展了每亩地再积万斤精肥的“肥料决战月”。在千军万马大战肥料的同时，还展开了一个大规模制造与整修农具运动，根据今年生产的需要，全区已整修、改良和制造工具六十七万件。基本农田实现耕作园田化的工作也正在展开，八万多人组成的水利专业队伍正在大战当年可以受益的小型水利工程；并且打破常规，采取破冰灌溉的措施，提早一个月开始了春浇。
    晋北专区是全国有名的低产区，地广人稀，土壤瘠薄，风旱霜冻等自然灾害较多，加以农民承袭着广种薄收的传统耕作习惯，许多耕地经常是好年景亩产几十斤，歉收年亩产十几斤。一年以前，有些人还把亩产百斤粮看成是不可能的事情，有的人说农业发展纲要指标是四、五、八百斤，晋北只能是四、五、八十斤，认为晋北条件落后，根本无法实现农业发展纲要指标。可是经过一年大跃进，晋北人民在党的领导下，在农业生产上展开了两条路线两种思想的斗争，大破保守思想以后，普遍改变耕作粗放、广种薄收为深耕细作，实行了基本农田制度，并结合进行农业技术改革，因而1958年的粮食比1957年增产一倍多，基本农田平均达到三百零三斤，超过1957年平均亩产量二倍半以上。
    晋北地区今年的跃进计划，是采取先找措施后订指标的办法订出的。他们首先找到了今年高产再高产的十大根据和有利条件，依靠这些根据，把去年的措施加以丰富，成为保证今年高产再高产的有力措施。它们是：一，晋北广大地区广种薄收的耕作方法，经过1958年初步执行基本农田制度，已经从根本上加以改变，1959年采取积极稳步的办法进一步贯彻这一制度，全区规划了基本粮田九百四十六万亩，以此作为高产再高产的基地。二，去年秋季全区共秋耕地一千万亩，其中近二百万亩基本农田深耕到三尺，其它都在一尺以上，这为今年高产再高产奠定了良好基础。为此必须进一步开展群众性的土壤普查和改良工作，在肥料、密植、整地方面都赶上去。三，去年的经验充分显示肥料对增产的巨大作用，今年积肥造肥工作还要大大超过去年，全区基本农田平均施肥量每亩可达三万斤，而且肥料质量也要比去年好。四，1958年全区水利建设大发展，对低产变高产起了巨大作用，目前，全区已有八百万亩水地，加上今年的工程，全区可达一千万亩水地，争取八百万亩水浇地成为旱涝保丰收的耕地，全区平均每人有二亩好水地。五，去年晋北主要农作物都出现了大面积高产纪录，这为今年的高产运动树立了标兵，提供了经验。综合这些经验，地委为全区六项主要作物制定出了分作物、分时期的新管理方案。各县都以六项作物管理新措施为内容，组织训练大批技术人员。通过贯彻六项作物管理方案，具体贯彻农业“八字宪法”，把耕作管理工作推向更高的水平。六，推广种植高产作物的经验，今年全区在九百多万亩粮田中，确定种植山药蛋，玉米，高粱三种作物四百万亩，占基本粮田的42％，麦田达到一百六十二万亩，比去年扩大面积一倍多。七，随着耕作制度的改革，地委确定进行耕作技术大改革，今年坚决使三百五十四万亩耕地初步实现耕作园田化，要求每亩产量至少达到一千五百斤。八，去年晋北人民已经基本上控制了山药蛋晚疫病，而且摸到一套规律，今年可确保山药蛋大丰收。九，1958年大跃进中晋北人民表现了高度勤劳勇敢的优良品质，今年加强社会主义和共产主义教育后，将继续发挥忘我劳动的精神。十，经过一年大跃进，各级党组织领导经验更加丰富，在1959年要求把领导措施与群众运动密切结合，把工作作得更深入更细致。
    目前，大抓措施，向措施要高产，已经成为晋北人民的行动口号。中共晋北地委要求把抓措施贯彻全年，用措施保证实现高产再高产。　　　　　　　（莎荫、杨义）
