Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency, the citizens of Surabaya, a city with a long revolutionary tradition, held a grand rally on the 5th to welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Approximately 200,000 people attended the welcoming rally.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh arrived in Surabaya on the morning of the 4th from Surakarta.

In his speech at the rally, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the current era is an era of the disintegration of colonialism and the inevitable victory of the national liberation movement.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that since the historic Bandung Conference, the anti-colonialist movement has advanced by leaps and bounds. Many countries in Asia and Africa have become independent, and the people of Latin American countries are rising up. He pointed out that the era of colonialists and imperialists running rampant in Asia and Africa is over.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the Vietnamese and Indonesian people, relying on patriotism, unity, and the determination to sacrifice for the people and the motherland, have overcome all difficulties and hardships and finally won a brilliant victory over the colonialists. He said that the reason why the Vietnamese and Indonesian people were victorious was because they united all the people, because justice was on their side, and because the peace-loving people of Asia, Africa, and the world sympathized with and supported them.

Referring to the imperialist and colonialist plot to turn West Irian and South Vietnam into military bases in order to prepare for new wars, he said, "We firmly believe that your struggle, like our struggle to unify our motherland, will surely be victorious."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that imperialism is now trying its best to create new tensions in Southeast Asia. It is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, carrying out subversive activities, and sowing discord among countries, with the aim of establishing dictatorial regimes that will carry out their orders. He said that their actions are endangering peace and the independence of Southeast Asian countries. He said that the Vietnamese and Indonesian people, together with the people of other Asian and African countries, strongly oppose the Southeast Asia military bloc and are determined to fight against all the treacherous schemes of the imperialists and colonialists.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Indonesia have established economic, cultural, and political relations and have sent friendly delegations to visit each other. He said that this friendly visit will help to further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the people of the two countries.

In his speech, President Sukarno warmly praised Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great ideals and his achievements in leading the Vietnamese people to drive the imperialists out of Vietnam. Sukarno said that although Indonesia achieved independence in 1945, and although the Geneva Conference recognized Vietnam's sovereignty, the revolutions of both countries have not been completed, and the imperialists are still constantly trying to undermine these two countries.

President Sukarno also said that the situation after the Asian-African Conference is favorable to the Asian-African national independence movement. The 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa and the progressive people of all countries have formed a strong force against imperialism. As long as the whole world unites, ten imperialisms are not to be feared, let alone one or two imperialisms.

President Sukarno emphasized that the imperialists have not abandoned their plot to enslave the Vietnamese and Indonesian people. The people must continue to resolutely fight against imperialism until imperialism is completely eradicated from the earth.

Shortly after the mass rally, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and President Sukarno flew to Bali. On both sides of the five-kilometer-long road leading to the airport, enthusiastic crowds cheered Chairman Ho Chi Minh warmly.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh, accompanied by President Sukarno, arrived at Batang, a famous scenic spot in Bali, Indonesia, on the afternoon of the 5th.

The people of Bali held a grand welcoming ceremony at the airport in the traditional way.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh is scheduled to return to Jakarta on the morning of the 7th after a two-day visit to Bali.

    胡志明主席在泗水群众大会上讲话
    谴责帝国主义又在东南亚制造紧张
    苏加诺总统说必须把帝国主义从地球上消灭
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：具有悠久革命传统的泗水市民5日上午举行了盛大集会欢迎胡志明主席。参加欢迎会的约二十万人。
    胡志明主席是在4日上午从梭罗到达泗水的。
    胡志明主席在大会上发表讲话时说，目前的时代是殖民主义土崩瓦解的时代，是民族解放运动必胜的时代。
    胡志明主席说，自从有历史意义的万隆会议以来，反对殖民主义的运动就大踏步地向前发展。亚洲和非洲许多国家已经独立，拉丁美洲国家的人民正在站起来。他指出，殖民主义者和帝国主义者在亚洲和非洲飞扬跋扈的时代已经过去了。
    胡志明主席说，越南和印度尼西亚人民依靠爱国主义、团结、以及为人民和祖国而牺牲的决心，已经克服了一切困难和艰苦，最后赢得了对殖民主义者的光辉胜利。他说，越南人民和印度尼西亚人民所以获得胜利，是因为他们团结全体人民；因为正义在他们一边，因为亚洲、非洲和全世界爱好和平的人民同情和支持他们。
    在谈到帝国主义和殖民主义把西伊里安和南越变成军事基地以便准备新战争的阴谋时，他说：“我们深信，你们的斗争，同我们争取统一我们祖国的斗争一样，一定会取得胜利。”
    胡志明主席说，帝国主义现在竭力在东南亚制造新的紧张气氛，它正在通过东南亚条约组织干涉其他国家的内政，进行颠复活动，在各国间散布不和，其目的是要建立执行他们命令的独裁政权。他说，他们的行动正在危害和平和东南亚国家的独立。他说，越南人民和印度尼西亚人民同亚非其他国家人民一道，强烈地反对东南亚军事集团，决心同帝国主义者和殖民主义者一切奸诈的阴谋进行斗争。
    胡志明主席说，越南民主共和国和印度尼西亚已经建立了经济、文化和政治关系，并且互相派遣了友好代表团进行访问。他说，这次友好的访问将有助于进一步加强两国人民间的兄弟友谊。
    苏加诺总统在讲话中热烈赞扬胡志明主席的伟大理想以及他领导越南人民把帝国主义者赶出越南的功迹。苏加诺说，虽然印度尼西亚已经在1945年取得了独立，虽然日内瓦会议已经承认越南的主权，但是两国的革命还没有完成，帝国主义者仍旧继续不断地设法破坏这两个国家。
    苏加诺总统又说，亚非会议以后的形势对亚非民族独立运动是有利的。十六亿亚非人民和一切国家的进步人民已经组成了强有力的反对帝国主义的力量。只要全世界团结起来，十个帝国主义也不可怕，一、两个帝国主义更不在话下。
    苏加诺总统强调说，帝国主义还没有放弃他们奴役越南和印度尼西亚人民的阴谋。人民必须继续坚决地同帝国主义进行斗争，直到把帝国主义完全从地球上消灭掉为止。
    群众大会以后不久，胡志明主席和苏加诺总统乘飞机前往巴厘。在通往机场的五公里长的公路两旁，热情的群众夹道向胡志明主席热烈欢呼。
    胡志明主席在苏加诺总统陪同下5日下午到达印度尼西亚著名胜地巴厘岛的巴塘。
    巴厘人民按照传统的方式在机场举行了盛大的欢迎会。
    胡志明主席预定在巴厘访问两天后，在7日上午回雅加达。
