    I Pick Up My Pen to Write a Letter Home
    Wu Guan
    Having returned to Beijing after a year of being sent down,
    I think of my loved ones morning and night.
    Every time I see the clouds in the sky,
    My heart flies to that remote mountain village.
    Opening my beloved old diary,
    This time last year, I was delivering manure in the South Mountain.
    I drove the donkey, and the old man led me,
    For the first time, I walked through that deep mountain gully.
    Now my hands still have thick calluses,
    And my cotton clothes still have patches from the old woman,
    In the blood burning throughout my body,
    Which drop does not sparkle with the deep affection of my loved ones!
    Outside the window, cars hum and speed by on the street,
    I remember the unfinished hydropower project,
    This year, my little nephew should be in the second grade,
    Surely a bright electric light has been hung in the classroom.
    Thinking and thinking, I pick up my pen to write a letter home,
    Thousands of words turn into infinite enthusiasm,
    Dear family! Though I am not at home, my heart is at home,
    This year, I will still leap forward with you!

    我拿起笔写封家信
    吴灌
    下放一年回到了北京，
    朝朝暮暮思念着亲人，
    每当我望见天边的云彩，
    心便飞向那偏僻的山村。
    翻开我心爱的旧日记本，
    去年今天我正在南山送粪。
    我赶着毛驴，大爷领着我，
    第一次在那深山沟里穿行。
    如今我手上还有结实的厚茧，
    身上棉衣还有着大娘的补丁，
    我浑身燃烧着的血液里，
    哪一滴不闪烁着亲人的深情！
    窗外大街上有汽车嗡嗡驰过，
    我想起那未完成的水电工程，
    今年小侄儿该上二年级了，
    课堂里准已挂上明亮的电灯。
    想着想着我拿起笔写封家信，
    千言万语化成了无穷热劲，
    亲人呵！我人不在家心在家，
    今年仍要和你们一同跃进！
