Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Blantyre: Africans in Nyasaland are roaring. Since the colonial authorities announced a "state of emergency" on the morning of the 3rd and arrested a large number of leaders of the Nyasaland African National Congress, large-scale struggles against colonial rule have broken out throughout Nyasaland, from the Blantyre and Limbe regions in the south to Karonga in the north. Reports say that the colonial authorities carried out bloody suppression, and on the 3rd alone, as many as twenty-seven people heroically sacrificed their lives in the struggle.

The largest massacre of Africans by the colonial authorities on the 3rd occurred in Nkhata Bay (north) next to Lake Nyasa. There, Africans had planned to release compatriots arrested by the colonial authorities under the so-called "emergency" regulations. The colonial authorities opened fire on them, killing twenty people and wounding twenty-six.

Many places in Nyasaland saw actions similar to the above-mentioned rescue of prisoners on the 3rd. In Mzimba, near Blantyre, a group of Africans stormed a prison and released the prisoners. A group of Africans imprisoned by the colonial authorities in Sumba Prison were also successfully rescued.

In the Blantyre and Limbe areas, three Africans were killed by the colonial authorities. In the Manning Fort area in the Central Province of Nyasaland, adjacent to Northern Rhodesia, colonial police killed one African and wounded another. In Visanza, five miles from Lilongwe, Africans attacked the local police station, resulting in one death.

There are also reports that in Karonga, northern Nyasaland, colonial police who had entered from Tanganyika a few days ago opened fire on about two thousand Africans participating in the resistance, killing two and wounding seven.

Reports say that in Blantyre, Africans have been on strike since the colonial authorities declared a state of emergency, and some factories have stopped work. Few people are working in the railway and public utilities departments. Reports also say that in the Blantyre and Limbe areas, the colonial authorities announced a curfew on the 3rd from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning.

According to an announcement by the Nyasaland colonial authorities on the 3rd, the colonial authorities have arrested 149 leaders of the Nyasaland African National Congress in this colony, fifty of whom have been "deported." Among those arrested, in addition to African National Congress Chairman Banda, there is also Chipembere, an African member of the Nyasaland Legislative Council.

The more than 2.6 million Africans in Nyasaland, who account for more than 99% of the population, have always firmly opposed the colonial rule of the very few British colonists over them. They strongly demand to break away from the so-called Central African Federation imposed on them by the British colonists in 1953, and demand autonomy and independence. An Associated Press reporter admitted that although the weapons used by Nyasaland Africans so far are only stones and sticks, their will to resist the colonial authorities' repressive measures is very firm.

    镇压愈残酷　反抗愈坚强
    尼亚萨兰反殖民统治斗争蔓延全境
    群众到处展开行动抢救被捕同胞
    新华社4日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰非洲人在怒吼中。自3日清晨殖民当局宣布“紧急状态”和逮捕大批非洲人国民大会领袖后，尼亚萨兰全境，从南方的布兰太尔和林贝地区一直到北方的卡龙加，到处都发生了大规模的反殖民统治的斗争。消息说，殖民当局进行了血腥镇压，仅3日一天，群众在斗争中英勇牺牲的就达二十七人。
    殖民当局在3日对非洲人的最大一次屠杀发生在尼亚萨湖旁的恩卡塔湾（北部）。在那里，非洲人曾计划释放被殖民当局根据所谓
  “紧急状态”规定而逮捕的同胞。殖民当局向他们开了枪，打死了二十个人，打伤了二十六人。
    尼亚萨兰的许多地方在3日都发生了类似上述援救被捕者的行动。在布兰太尔附近的姆津，一群非洲人冲入一座监狱，释放了被捕者。被殖民当局囚禁在松巴监狱中的一批非洲人，也被人们胜利地抢救了出来。
    在布兰太尔和林贝地区，有三名非洲人被殖民当局打死。在尼亚萨兰中部省份毗邻北罗得西亚的曼宁堡地区，殖民警察打死一个非洲人，打伤一人。在距利郎格韦五英里处的维散扎，非洲人曾攻击了当地的派出所，有一名死亡。
    还有消息说，在尼亚萨兰北部的卡龙加，前些日子从坦噶尼喀开进来的殖民警察曾向参加反抗行动的大约两千名非洲人开枪，打死两人，打伤七人。
    有消息说，在布兰太尔，非洲人自殖民当局宣布紧急状态之后就举行了罢工，有些工厂已经停工。在铁路、公用事业部门中工作的人也很少。消息还说，在布兰太尔和林贝地区，殖民当局在3日已宣布从傍晚六时到次晨六时实行宵禁。
    据尼亚萨兰殖民当局3日宣布，殖民当局在这一殖民地上已逮捕了尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的一百四十九个负责人，其中有五十名已被“递解出境”。在被捕的人当中除非洲人国民大会主席班达外，还有尼亚萨兰立法会议的非洲籍议员契佩姆贝雷。
    占人口99％还多的二百六十多万尼亚萨兰非洲人从来就坚决反对极少数英国殖民者对他们的殖民统治。他们强烈地要求脱离英国殖民者在1953年强加在他们头上的所谓中非联邦，要求自治和独立。美联社记者承认，虽然到目前为止尼亚萨兰非洲人所用的武器仅仅是石块和木棍，但是他们反抗殖民当局镇压措施的意志是十分坚决的。（附图片）
