Linking Industry and Commerce

Industry and commerce are two different departments with different tasks. The former is production, and the latter is circulation and exchange. This is a necessary division of labor in society. However, although the nature and tasks of industrial and commercial departments are different, they have only one purpose: to meet the needs of people's production and life.

Different tasks, the same goal, this requires them to be linked together, to work together, to maximize efficiency, and to serve the overall goal together. Recently, in order to better meet people's needs, the Wuhan department store system has taken the initiative to link up with the industrial sector, twisting industry and commerce into one rope, so that production, wholesale, sales, storage and transportation are tightly linked. People vividly call it a "one-stop" process. This method is undoubtedly a good way to promote production and ensure supply.

First of all, all links are organized, everyone cares about production, promotes production, and focuses on solving production problems, so that market supply is guaranteed; secondly, industry and commerce are integrated, jointly responsible for the market, and the commercial sector reflects market conditions to the industrial sector at any time, so that people's needs are closely linked with production, and the industrial sector also has a clear idea, reducing the blindness of production; thirdly, it promotes the development of local industrial production and reduces the amount of purchases from other places by the commercial sector; fourthly, industrial and commercial departments cultivate experimental plots for each other, regularly participate in production labor and commercial work, so that leadership work is more in-depth, and the understanding of production and market supply is strengthened, so as to better improve production and improve business management, and so on. In short, there are many benefits.

To make the link between industry and commerce good, regular and effective, the key lies in the fact that each other must carry forward the spirit of communist collaboration.

Help each other, supervise each other, and make the various links closely connected and in step. In this way, production and circulation will be truly linked, and we can better serve production and people's lives.

    工商挂钩
    工业和商业是两个不同的部门，有各自不同的任务；前者是生产，后者是流通、交换。这是必需的社会分工。不过工业部门和商业部门的性质、任务虽然不同，但目的却只有一个：满足人们生产和生活的需要。
    任务不同，目的一致，这就需要彼此挂起钩来，协同动作，发挥最大的效能，共同为总的目的服务。最近武汉百货系统为了更好的满足人们的需要，主动和工业部门挂钩，把工业和商业拧成一股绳，使生产、批发、销售、储运等环节紧紧衔接起来，人们形象地称它为“一条龙”，这个办法无疑是促进生产、保证供应的好办法。
    首先，各个环节组织起来了，人人关心生产，促进生产，集中解决生产上的问题，使市场供应得到保证；其次，工商一体，共同对市场负责，通过商业部门随时向工业部门反映市场情况，使人民需要和生产紧密结合起来，工业部门也心中有数，减少了生产的盲目性；第三，促进本地区工业生产的发展，减少了商业部门依靠到外地采购的数量；第四，工业和商业部门相互种试验田，定期参加生产劳动和商业工作，使领导工作更加深入，加强了对生产和对市场供应的了解，从而能更好地改进生产和改善经营管理，等等。总之，好处很多。
    要使工商挂钩挂得好、挂得经常和有成效，关键在于彼此都要发扬共产主义大协作的精神。
    互相帮助，互相检查督促，使各个环节紧密相连，步调一致，这样，生产和流通就真正挂上钩了，就能更好地为生产和人民生活服务了。
