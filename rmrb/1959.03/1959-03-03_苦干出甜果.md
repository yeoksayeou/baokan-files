    Hard Work Brings Sweet Fruit
    Teachers and students of the Geography Department of Gansu Normal University, using the revolutionary spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, have produced nine kinds of products such as quartz wedges and rosin glue.
    Rosin glue is widely used in the pasting of rock thin sections and in the laboratory; quartz wedges are important tools for studying crystal photons. For several years, the department has repeatedly purchased these two products from home and abroad, which were very expensive and difficult to buy. Under the call of the Party to break down superstition and liberate thinking, Comrade Xu Ruihu, an experimenter, brought into play the communist style of daring to think and daring to act. He used all his holidays and some evenings to study carefully, referring to the method provided in the article "Rosin Glue—A New Product Surpassing Britain and the United States" published in "Geological Science," and successfully produced two bottles of resin substitutes—rosin glue—after many experiments. After preliminary identification, the quality was high. Comrade Xu Ruihu continued his efforts, carefully studied the reasons for the past failures in trial-producing quartz wedges, referred to relevant books, and experimented more than six times. He also successfully trial-produced two kinds of quartz wedges, with good performance. These two products have solved certain difficulties for the geological experiment work of the department.

    苦干出甜果
    甘肃师范大学地理系的师生，用苦干实干巧干的革命精神，制出了石英楔子、松脂胶等九种产品。
    松脂胶广泛地应用于岩石薄片的粘贴和实验室方面；石英楔子是研究晶体光子的重要工具。这两种产品，该系几年来曾多次向国内外采购，价钱很贵，且不易买到。在党的破除迷信、解放思想的号召下，实验员徐瑞湖同志发挥了敢想敢作的共产主义风格，他利用所有的假日和部分晚上，细心钻研，参照“地质科学”上刊登的“超过英美新产品——松脂胶”一文提供的方法，经过多次试验制成功两瓶树胶代用品——松脂胶。经过初步鉴定，质量较高。徐瑞湖同志又再接再厉，细心研究了过去试制石英楔子失败的原因，参考有关书籍，试验六次以上，又试制成功石英楔子两种，效能良好。这两种产品，给该系地质实验工作解决了一定困难。
