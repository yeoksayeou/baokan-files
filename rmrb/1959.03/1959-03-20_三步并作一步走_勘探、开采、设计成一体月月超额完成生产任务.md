Taking Three Steps as One

Integrating Exploration, Mining, and Design to Exceed Production Targets Monthly

    (Our report) Since last year, the central section of the Qilian Mountains has adopted a method of simultaneous exploration, mining, and design—integrating exploration, mining, and design, with mutual cooperation and a common leap forward.

    The method of simultaneous exploration, mining (using indigenous methods for both mining and smelting), and design emerged as a good approach during the Great Leap Forward last year. In the past, exploration departments would conduct exploration, hand over geological data, and then design departments would design, followed by mining and factory construction. This process would take two, or even four or five years. Such a lengthy timeframe was not in line with the momentum of the Great Leap Forward. Last year, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, the geological, design, and production personnel in the Qilian Mountains broke with convention and combined the three steps into one. Based on the preliminary survey data, the Qilian Mountains Geological Team determined where to drill and where to excavate adits, making specific arrangements. The Geological Team was responsible for drilling; the production departments carried out adit excavation according to the Geological Team's arrangements, extracting ore and providing exploration data simultaneously, achieving two goals at once; the design departments, while exploration was underway, sent personnel to the site for design work and conducted experiments. This helped advance the exploration and mining work and promptly informed the Geological Team of the results of industrial experiments, making the geological data (reserves, grade, etc.) more accurate and precise.

    In the process of simultaneous exploration, mining, and design, the integration of the three naturally fostered a relationship of mutual cooperation. For example, when the production departments lacked technology and equipment, the Geological Team would send technical personnel to provide guidance and lend excavation machinery, ensuring a steady supply of ore to the smelters and exceeding the copper production targets every month. The production departments also used their empty trucks returning from transporting ore to help the Geological Team transport supplies, enabling the Geological Team to conduct winter drilling smoothly and deliver geological data suitable for building a medium-sized or larger copper smelter within a short four months. At the same time, due to the accelerated exploration progress, the design departments will also deliver the design drawings for mine and factory construction one or two years ahead of schedule.

    三步并作一步走
    勘探、开采、设计成一体月月超额完成生产任务
    本报讯  从去年以来，祁连山中段地区采取了边勘探、边开采、边设计的办法——勘探、开采、设计三位一体，相互协作，共同跃进。
    边勘探、边开采（土法开采，土法冶炼）、边设计的办法，是去年大跃进中出现的一种好办法。按照过去的习惯，勘探部门在勘探之后，交出地质资料，再由设计部门去设计，最后再开采和建厂生产。时间要两年甚至四、五年。这样长的时间，是与大跃进的形势不相适应的。去年，祁连山的地质、设计和生产人员，在当地党委统一领导下，打破了常规，把三步并做一步走。祁连山地质队根据普查的资料，确定在何处钻探，何处开平巷，具体布置好，地质队负责钻探；生产部门按照地质队的布置进行平巷掘进，在掘进中既采了矿石，又提供了勘探资料，一举两得；设计部门则在勘探同时，一面派人到现场进行设计，一面进行试验，这样既帮助了勘探和开采工作的进行，也及时地将工业试验的结果告诉地质队，使地质资料（储量、品位等）更准确更精密。
    在边勘探、边开采、边设计的过程中，由于三位一体地进行工作，自然地形成了相互协作的关系。如生产部门技术差，设备不足，地质队便派技术人员进行指导，借给掘进机械等，使矿石源源地供应着冶炼厂，月月超额完成铜的生产任务；生产部门也用自己的运输矿石的回空车辆，帮助地质队运输物资，使得地质队能够顺利地进行冬季钻探，并在短短的四个月内，交出了可以建设一个中型以上炼铜厂的地质资料。同时，由于勘探进度的加快，设计部门也将提前一两年交出建矿建厂的设计图纸。
