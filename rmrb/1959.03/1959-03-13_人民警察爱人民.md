People's Police Love the People

    Fire Brigade Dives into Water to Save People

    Early in the morning, the Yangtze River was shrouded in a thick white fog. Suddenly, a "woo woo woo..." alarm whistle sounded from the center of the river. The alarm whistle woke up the members of the Chongqing Public Security Bureau's Fire Brigade No. 9, who had just finished their night shift and gone to bed. They immediately jumped out of their warm beds and drove the fire boat towards the scene.

    It turned out that the "208" ferry, on its way to Danzishi, had unfortunately collided with a ship. When the firefighters arrived, dozens of passengers were standing on the roof of the boat waiting to be rescued, while many others were struggling in the water inside the sinking hull. The further the boat drifted downstream, the lower it sank. The lives of dozens of people were in imminent danger. The firefighters quickly brought the fire boat alongside the sinking ship and rescued the victims one by one. They then jumped into the submerged cabin to save more people. When firefighters Bai Yinqing and Shi Zhuan’an carried a woman out of the cabin, they were both blue with cold. However, they persisted in the icy river water and rescued a total of fourteen passengers.

    After the victims were taken to the fire brigade, the firefighters immediately put them in beds, gave them tea and water, shared all their breakfast with them, and notified their relatives one by one. It wasn't until noon that the victims, under the care of their relatives, gratefully bid farewell to their saviors.

    "Use My Blood!"

    One day at noon, Liu Wenjian, the household registration police officer from the Shibaba Street Police Station in Nanjing, took a sick student to the hospital. By the time he returned, it was past noon. As he was about to go home for lunch, a public security committee member ran over to report: "Old Mrs. Peng has been burned!" Liu Wenjian was shocked to hear this. He thought: I just left the Peng family an hour ago, how could something have happened? He rushed to Old Mrs. Peng's house.

    Eighty-year-old Old Mrs. Peng, who lived at No. 12 Changsheng Temple, had been ill for over a month, and Liu Wenjian often visited her. That morning, the old woman accidentally burned her quilt while smoking. She was paralyzed in bed, unable to shout or struggle, and her face and body were burned. When Liu Wenjian arrived, he quickly took her to the hospital. After examination, the doctor determined that her condition was serious and that she needed a blood transfusion. Without hesitation, Liu Wenjian extended his arm and said, "Use my blood!" He gave Old Mrs. Peng dozens of CCs of blood, which finally turned the tide. When the old woman's grandson arrived at the hospital and learned about this, he was moved to tears.

    It’s Very Different Here Compared to Hong Kong

    The customs clock struck two. At the Qianshan pier in Guangdong and on the ships docked there, several people's police officers were busy helping elderly and frail passengers board the ships.

    At the exit of the customs inspection shed stood a woman of about forty years old. Beside her were two large suitcases, which would be difficult for her to carry onto the ship. Just as she was getting anxious, the people's police arrived and helped her carry all her luggage to her berth. Having lived in Hong Kong for many years, this woman, following the Hong Kong custom, hurriedly took out money and asked, "How much do I owe you?" The people's police smiled and said, "No charge! Because I am a people's police officer, and I am here to serve the people."

    Before this woman could fully understand what the policeman meant, the passengers on the ship chimed in, explaining to her, "This is a socialist society!" She suddenly understood and said with emotion, "The people's police are so good! This is not a world of money, it's so different from Hong Kong!"

    人民警察爱人民
    救火队下水救人
    清晨，长江笼罩在白茫茫浓雾中。忽然，从江心发出了“呜呜呜……”报警的汽笛声。报警汽笛声惊醒了刚加过夜班入睡不久的重庆市公安局消防九队的队员们，他们立即跳出暖和和的被窝，驾驶救火艇朝出事地点奔去。
    原来，是“208”号轮渡在开往弹子石的途中，不幸与一艘轮船相撞了。消防队员们赶到时，在船顶盖上站着好几十位待救乘客，而船舱内还有不少人正在即将没顶的水中挣扎。船愈往下流，也就愈往下沉。几十个人的生命处在千钧一发的时刻。消防队员们迅速将救火艇靠拢沉船船舷，将遇险者一个一个救上艇来，又跳入已被淹没的船舱里去救人。当白银清、石竹安两位队员从舱内背出一个妇女时，两人都被冻得脸色铁青了。但他们仍坚持在刺骨的江水中，一共救起了十四位旅客。
    当受难者被送到消防队以后，队员们又立即将他们一个个安置在床上，给他们送茶送水，把自己的早点全部分给他们吃，并一一通知了他们的亲属。直到中午，这些受难者才在亲属的照顾下，怀着感激的心情，告别了自己的救命恩人。
    “输我的血吧！”
    一天中午，南京市石坝街派出所户籍警刘文简把一个生病的学生送到医院，回来时已经十二点多了。他正要回家吃饭，忽然治安保卫委员跑来报告：“彭老太太被火烧伤了！”刘文简听了这话吃了一惊，心想：我刚离开彭家一个多钟头，怎么就出了事？他急忙朝彭老太太家奔去。
    住在长生祠十二号的八十岁的彭老太太，生病一个多月了，刘文简常去看她。这天上午，老太太吸烟不慎烧着了被子，她瘫在床上呼喊不出，挣扎不得，脸上和身上都烧伤了。刘文简赶到后，就急忙把她送到医院。医生检查后认为病情和伤情严重，需要输血。刘文简毫不犹豫地伸出胳臂说：“输我的血吧！”他给彭老太太输了几十CC的血，使彭老太太终于转危为安了。当老太太的孙子赶到医院，知道了这件事以后，感动得哭起来了。
    这里和香港大不同
    海关的大钟敲过了两点。在广东前山码头上和停泊在那里的船上，有几位人民警察在忙着帮助年老体弱的旅客登船。
    在海关检查棚的出口处，站着一位大约四十岁左右的妇女。在她身边放着两件大行李，要搬到船上，对她来说是很困难的。她正在发急的时候，人民警察来了，帮助她把全部行李背到了她的铺位上。在香港住了多年的这位妇女，照着香港的规距，急忙掏出钱来问：“要多少钱？”人民警察笑道：“不要钱！因为我是人民警察，是为人民服务的。”
    这位妇女还没有完全弄明白民警的意思，在船上的旅客就你一句我一句地给她解释道：“这儿是社会主义的社会嘛！”她恍然大悟，感动地说：“人民警察真好！这里不是金钱世界，和香港真是大不相同啊！”
