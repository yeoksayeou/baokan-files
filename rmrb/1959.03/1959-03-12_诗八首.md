    Eight Poems
    Zhu De
    Ode to the Great Leap Forward in Guangdong's Industry and Agriculture
    This year is the year to pass the production threshold, male and female workers are stirring up the sky
    Excavating ten million tons of raw coal, completing the plan and taking the lead
    Setting the target at 100 billion catties of grain, adhering to the eight-character principle for high yield
    Red flags are planted all over the communes, relying on the enthusiasm of the farmers
    Guangzhou celebrates the Spring Festival this year, everyone is happy with ample food and clothing
    Going further from the hundred-foot pole, the enthusiasm can be encouraged but not diminished
      Visiting Luogang Ancestral Hall
    Luogang Ancestral Hall at the foot of Luogang Mountain, retaining Wen Tianxiang's four poems
    Loyalty to the country leaves a lasting reputation, and his demeanor can be a teacher for future generations
      Visiting Shimen
    Looking at Shaoguan from Shimen Mountain, the thousand-mile river boat returns in a day
    One boat pulls thirteen, instantly flying past the Lychee Bay
      Hot Spring Scenery
    Plum blossoms bloom after peach blossoms, with green bamboo and pines lining the banks
    Only the lychee orchard is even better, with warm springs spraying out from the empty forest
        Rhyming with Director He Xiangning's Original Poem
            (I)
    Farmers turned over with land reform, working hard for nine years diligently day after day
    Joining workers in the Great Leap Forward, forming a deep friendship in the commune
            (II)
    Moving mountains and reclaiming the sea, ambition shakes the sky, with hundreds of millions of people surging forward
    Organizing allied forces to build together, unprecedented changes in the landscape

    诗八首
    朱德
    祝广东工农业大跃进
    今年生产过关年　男女工人劲掀天
    挖得原煤千万吨　完成计划着先鞭
    千亿斤粮作指标　八字坚持产量高
    红旗插遍公社里　依靠农民干劲豪
    穗市今年过春节　丰衣足食人人悦
    百尺竿头更向前　干劲可鼓不可泄
      游罗岗祠
    罗岗山下罗岗祠　留有文山四首诗
    忠心为国声名在　仪表堪称后世师
      游石门
    石门山上望韶关　千里江船一日还
    一船拖得十三艘　霎时飞过荔枝湾
      温泉风景
    梅花开后桃花开　绿竹青松夹岸排
    唯有荔枝园更好　林空喷出暖泉来
        和何香凝主任原韵
            （一）
    农民分地大翻身　苦战九年镇日勤
    联合工人同跃进　结成公社友谊深
            （二）
    移山造海志掀天　千万人民涌向前
    组织联军齐建设　山河改变例无先
