Colonialists on the Volcano

Flames of Fury Burn in Central and East Africa
The struggle of the African people for independence and freedom has ignited everywhere. At the beginning of this year, the Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule shook the Belgian colonialists' throne in the "oasis of stability." Now, in Nyasaland, and even in the vast lands of British Central and East Africa, fierce struggles against British colonialists have broken out everywhere. Over the past two months, the struggle in this region has developed extensively.

In British Central Africa (Rhodesia and Nyasaland), since the return of delegates who attended the All-African People's Conference in Accra at the end of last year, large-scale mass rallies have been held in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia, and Zomba, the capital of Nyasaland, to protest against British colonial rule and demand immediate independence. Hastings Banda, Chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, issued a battle cry, shouting: "The British must leave immediately! Africans must replace them immediately!" A reporter for the British "Manchester Guardian" said: "This is the first time that African leaders have publicly announced such a proposition to the African masses in the Central African region."

The struggle of the people of Nyasaland has developed particularly rapidly and fiercely. Angry crowds occupied airports, attacked courts, and fought with colonial troops and police. On March 3, a nationwide revolt broke out in Nyasaland. In the areas of Zomba, Blantyre, and Karonga, the African people, regardless of the suppression by colonial troops and police, opened prisons and released persecuted patriots. Workers went on strike, schools were closed, and all civil aviation activities were suspended.

The just struggle of the people of Nyasaland has received the support of the African National Congress of Southern Rhodesia, which has powerfully promoted the struggle of the people of British East Africa.

In the British-administered territory of Tanganyika, mass rallies and demonstrations are constantly taking place. According to official Tanganyikan materials, mass struggles against colonial rule have recently taken place in the areas of Geita, Mwanza, and Kwimba.

In Kenya, nationalist organizations issued calls to boycott the visit of the British Queen Mother, expressing the Kenyan people's protest against bloody colonial rule.

At the end of last month, the Somaliland region broke out in a revolt against colonial rule. A large number of African people in Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland, engaged in fierce fighting with colonial troops and police who attacked the headquarters of the Greater Somalia League, which aroused widespread sympathy and support among the people of British Somaliland and French Somaliland.

In the more than three million square kilometers of land in British Central and East Africa, the flames of resistance are burning everywhere. A reporter for the British "Times" newspaper, after traveling in Central and East Africa for three months, had to admit that "everywhere, colonialism is found to be in decline." Africa is "rapidly moving towards independence led by the African majority!"

"African Ruhr" and "Fortress Colony"

Britain is one of the major colonial powers in Africa. Most of Britain's colonies in Africa are located in Central and East Africa. This region is rich in extremely important minerals, which bring huge profits to British monopoly capitalists every year. At the same time, this region is also of great strategic importance to Britain's aggressive activities in the Middle East and South Asia.

British Central Africa is a very important region among Britain's current colonies. The region's copper production reaches more than 430,000 tons per year, cobalt and cobalt alloy production is 1,300 tons per year, ranking third in the capitalist world; chromium is more than 440,000 tons, ranking fifth in the capitalist world; gold is about 540,000 taels, ranking sixth in the capitalist world. In addition, this region is also one of the main producing areas of lithium in the capitalist world, a mineral used to manufacture high-speed aircraft and hydrogen bombs.

British monopoly capital has huge investments in the Central African region. American capital has also been trying every means to enter this region for a long time. In Southern Rhodesia alone, over the past decade, the scale of colonialist plundering of industrial and mining raw materials has expanded three times, exceeding the rate of expansion in the Belgian Congo during the same period. As investment expands, profits also increase rapidly. Taking the main mineral copper in the Central African region as an example, according to the greatly reduced figures in the annual reports of four companies, such as Mufulira Company and Roan Antelope Company, the net profit accounted for 17% of the output value in 1950, and rose to 40% in 1956, reaching 140 million US dollars. Colonialists smugly call the Central African region the future "industrial heart" of the African continent and the future "Ruhr" of Africa.

The British East Africa region (Tanganyika, Kenya, Uganda, and British Somaliland, etc.) also has rich mineral resources. Tanganyika is one of the richest regions in the capitalist world in terms of diamond reserves. Kenya produces gold and natural soda. Uganda has strategic materials such as mica. However, the current production of these minerals is not large. Agricultural production is the main thing, but it is not the most affluent region in Africa. For Britain, the importance of East Africa lies mainly in its strategic significance.

Opening the map, you can see that British East Africa and the British colonies in the southern Arabian Peninsula (Aden, Oman, etc.) are just located on both sides of the mouth of the Red Sea, along the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. The British colonies in the southern Arabian Peninsula are currently important bases for Britain to control Middle Eastern oil and suppress Middle Eastern national independence movements, while the East African region is a stronghold for Britain to support its aggressive activities in the Middle East and suppress African national independence movements. Due to the upsurge of the Cypriot people's anti-British struggle, Britain even planned to replace its military bases in Cyprus with the air, land, and sea base system in Kenya, making it an important part of the entire Commonwealth strategic system. When Britain launched an armed invasion of Jordan last year, Britain transferred troops from East Africa to reinforce the Middle East. Therefore, in the eyes of British colonial officials, East Africa, especially Kenya, is their "fortress colony" (according to British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd).

The upsurge of national independence movements in British East and Central Africa not only shakes the foundation of British colonial rule in Africa, but will also cause British aggressive activities in the southern Arabian Peninsula to lose an important "rear area."

Struggling to Save Colonial Rule

The raging flames of the national independence movement in British East and Central Africa have left the British ruling class in a state of constant panic. In late January, British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd hastily summoned the four governors of British East Africa to London for a meeting to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, the British "Royal African Society" held a meeting to discuss the African situation. The meeting was attended by representatives of hundreds of large British companies investing in Africa and a number of colonial officials. The scale of the meeting was unprecedented since the establishment of the association. In early February, the British Queen Mother visited Kenya and Uganda. These facts all indicate that the African situation has become an urgent problem for Britain.

At the meeting of the British "Royal African Society" held at the end of January, one of the main speakers, Harry Greenfell, after reviewing the development trend of national independence movements in various parts of Africa, reluctantly admitted: "Withdrawal from the colonies is a realistic decision, because Britain's financial and material resources are not enough to cope with the increasingly strong demands of so many regions." However, on the other hand, the British ruling group clearly stated that Britain must not withdraw from Africa. At the meeting of the British "Royal African Society," another speaker, Oliver Woods, openly clamored: "We must continue to stay in Africa. Unless we stay in Africa, we will not be able to obtain the raw materials and African markets necessary for industry."

In order to continue to maintain the precarious colonial rule in East and Central Africa, strengthening armed suppression is an important method in Britain's current policy. During the British East African Governors' Conference, the commentary of "East Africa and Rhodesia," a publication that often reflects British official opinion, revealed the sinister plans of the colonialists. The publication wrote: "Undeniably, in recent years, the governments of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanganyika have been too accommodating (?) to African nationalist extremists," and the British colonial authorities should "show a willingness to tame them."

Before and after the British East African Governors' Conference, Britain more frantically carried out bloody suppression of the national independence movement in East and Central Africa. The people of Nyasaland and Rhodesia were massacred and arrested in batches. The African National Congress was declared illegal, and the leaders and hundreds of staff members of the organization were thrown into prison. Hastings Banda, Chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, and some other members were also arrested. In Kenya, gatherings of more than three people are "illegal." In Tanganyika, in mid-February, the colonial authorities took advantage of the incident in which a colonial police patrol car was attacked to carry out a frantic retaliation, arresting more than 1,500 African residents indiscriminately. Currently, Britain's suppression activities in East and Central Africa are still expanding.

In addition to military suppression, Britain is also continuing to use political deception and strengthen economic control in East and Central Africa. Many regions are undergoing so-called "general elections." Spokespersons for British monopoly capital, under the guise of "Britain providing funds and technology, and Africa providing resources" and "racial partnership," are making every effort to expand their plunder and control over Central and East Africa.

Cannot Stop the Eruption of the Volcano

Whether it is carrying out violent suppression or strengthening political and economic control, the British colonialists cannot stop the eruption of the volcano under their throne.

The colonial rulers' butcher knife can only make the African people more sober and more determined to join the struggle. The struggles of the people of Algeria, Cameroon, and the Belgian Congo have all proved this truth. The great revolt of the people of Nyasaland has also proved this truth. Britain's use of modern weapons and police to suppress unarmed African people in Nyasaland and Central and East Africa only reflects the isolation of British colonialists and the strength of the African people.

The lies of so-called "racial partnership" have long been rejected by the people of British Central and East Africa. Leonard Chirwa, a leader of the national independence movement in Nyasaland, clearly revealed the purpose of these lies many years ago, which is only to obtain high profits and cheap labor, and only means "the desecration of the African heritage—Africa's natural resources—the destruction of land, the exploitation of labor, the robbery of wealth. All of this is to enrich those speculators in London or New York who are single-mindedly trying to drain Africa dry. ...These things are not what I need, nor what any African patriot needs."

Not long ago, a reporter for the British "Times" said that the "psychological state" of British African colonialists is "the same as that of those who live on the slopes of a volcano. They now know that there is a lot of lava, but they hope that it will not erupt while they are alive." However, the African people have answered them with increasingly powerful practical actions: their hopes have failed. The volcanoes of the African continent are rumbling, and the erupting lava is surging. (Attached picture)

    火山口上的殖民主义者
    陶恺
    中非东非怒火丛烧
    非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争，烽火四起。今年年初，刚果人民发动的反对殖民统治的斗争，震撼着比利时殖民主义者在“安定的绿洲”的宝座。现在尼亚萨兰，以至整个英属中非和东非的广大土地上，也到处爆发了反抗英国殖民者的强烈的斗争。两个多月来，这个地区的斗争已经有了普遍的发展。
    在英属中非（罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰），自从出席去年年底在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会的代表回来以后，南罗得西亚首府索尔兹伯里和尼亚萨兰首府松巴等地，都曾举行大规模的群众集会，抗议英国殖民统治，要求立即获得独立。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达发出战斗的号角，高呼：“英国人必须立即走开！必须立即让非洲人代替他们！”英国“曼彻斯特卫报”记者说：“在中非地区，非洲人领袖公开向非洲群众宣布这样的主张，这还是第一次。”
    尼亚萨兰人民的斗争，发展特别迅速和猛烈。愤怒的群众占领机场，进攻法院，同殖民军警展开了搏斗。3月3日，尼亚萨兰更爆发了全国范围的大暴动。在松巴、布兰太尔、卡龙加等地区，非洲人民不顾殖民军警的镇压，打开监狱，释放被迫害的爱国人民。工人罢工，学校停课，民航活动也为之全部停止。
    尼亚萨兰人民的正义斗争，得到了南罗得西亚的非洲人国民大会的支援，有力地推动着英属东非人民的斗争。
    英国托管地坦噶尼喀，不断发生群众性的集会示威。据坦噶尼喀官方材料透露，最近在盖塔、姆万沙、克温巴等地区，都有过群众性的反对殖民统治的斗争。
    在怯尼亚，民族主义组织发出号召，抵制英王母后的访问，表示了怯尼亚人民对于血腥的殖民统治的抗议。
    索马里兰地区上月底爆发了反对殖民统治的暴动。意属索马里兰首府摩加迪沙的大批非洲人民和进攻大索马里亚联盟总部的殖民军警展开激烈的斗争，在英属索马里兰和法属索马里兰人民中引起了广泛的同情和支持。
    在英属中非和东非三百多万平方公里的土地上，反抗的怒火丛烧。英国“泰晤士报”记者在中非和东非旅行了三个月后，不得不承认“无论到什么地方，都发现殖民主义正在衰退”。非洲正在“迅速地朝着由占多数非洲人领导的独立前进”！
  “非洲鲁尔区”和“要塞殖民地”
    英国是在非洲的主要殖民国家之一。英国在非洲的殖民地又大部分位于中非和东非。这个地区蕴藏着极其重要的矿产，每年带给英国垄断资本家以巨额的利润。同时，这个地区对于英国侵略中东和南亚的活动，还具有很大的战略意义。
    英属中非是英国目前的殖民地中一个十分重要的地区。这个地区铜产量每年达四十三万多吨，钴和钴合金年产量一千三百吨，占资本主义世界第三位；铬四十四万余吨，占资本主义世界第五位；黄金约五十四万两，占资本主义世界第六位。此外，这个地区还是资本主义世界的锂的主要产地之一，这种矿产是制造高速飞机和氢弹的原料。
    英国垄断资本在中非地区有巨大的投资。美国资本也早已千方百计地打入这个地区。仅在南罗得西亚，过去十年间，英国等殖民主义的掠夺工矿原料的规模就扩张了三倍之多，超过了比属刚果在同期的扩张速度。随着投资的扩大，利润也随着迅速增加。以中非地区的主要矿产铜矿为例，据穆夫里拉公司、罗安·恩蒂洛普公司等四家公司年度报告中大大缩小了的数字，1950年纯利润占产值的17％，1956年已上升到40％，达一亿四千万美元。殖民主义者洋洋自得地把中非地区称为非洲大陆未来的“工业心脏”和非洲未来的“鲁尔区”。
    英属东非地区（坦噶尼喀、怯尼亚、乌干达和英属索马里兰等地）也有着丰富的矿藏。坦噶尼喀是资本主义世界金刚石蕴藏量最丰富地区之一。怯尼亚出产黄金和天然苏打。乌干达蕴藏有重要战略原料辉石。但是，目前这些矿藏产量并不大。农业出产是主要的，但也不是非洲的最富庶的地区。对英国来说，东非的重要性主要在于它的战略意义上。
    打开地图，就可以看到英属东非和阿拉伯半岛南部的英国殖民地（亚丁、阿曼等地），刚好位于红海海口两侧的印度洋和阿拉伯海沿岸。阿拉伯半岛南部的英国殖民地，是目前英国控制中东石油、镇压中东民族独立运动的重要基地，而东非地区则是英国支援它在中东的侵略活动和镇压非洲民族独立运动的据点。由于塞浦路斯人民反英斗争的高涨，英国并曾计划以怯尼亚的海陆空军基地体系代替它在塞浦路斯的军事基地，而使之成为整个英联邦战略体系中的重要一环。去年英国对约旦进行武装侵略的时候，英国曾经从东非调兵增援中东。因此，在英国的殖民官员眼中，东非、特别是怯尼亚是他们的“要塞殖民地”（英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德语）。
    英属东非和中非地区民族独立运动的高涨，不仅震撼了英国在非洲的殖民统治的基础，而且也将使阿拉伯半岛南部的英国侵略活动失去了一个重要的“后方”。
    挽救殖民统治的挣扎
    英属东非和中非地区民族独立运动的熊熊火焰，使英国统治阶级惶惶不可终日。1月下旬，英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德匆忙召集了英属东非的四个总督到伦敦开会，商讨对策。与此同时，英国“皇家非洲协会”举行集会讨论非洲形势。参加这次会议的有数百家在非洲进行投资的英国大公司的代表和若干殖民地官员，规模之大，为该会成立以来所少有。2月初，英王母后又去怯尼亚和乌干达进行了访问。这些事实都表明，非洲局势已经成为英国感到棘手的紧迫问题。
    在英国“皇家非洲协会”1月底举行的会议上，主要发言人之一哈利·格林费尔回顾了非洲各地民族独立运动的发展形势以后，无可奈何地承认：“自殖民地撤退是一种现实的决定，因为英国的财力物力都不足以应付这么多地区的越来越强烈的要求”。但是，在另一方面，英国统治集团又明白表示英国绝不能退出非洲。英国“皇家非洲协会”会议上，另一发言人奥立佛·伍兹公开叫嚣说：“我们必须继续留在非洲。除非我们留在非洲，我们将得不到工业所必须的原料和非洲的市场”。
    为了继续维持住摇摇欲坠的东非和中非的殖民统治，加强武装镇压是英国当前政策中的一个重要手法。在英属东非总督会议期间，经常反映英国官方意见的刊物“东非洲和罗得西亚”的评论，就透露了殖民者的凶险计划。这家刊物写道：“不可否认地，近几年来，乌干达、怯尼亚和坦噶尼喀的政府是过于迁就（？）非洲民族主义过激分子了”，英国殖民当局应
  “显示一下驯服他们的意志”。
    在英属东非总督会议前后，英国更加疯狂地对东非和中非的民族独立运动进行血腥镇压。尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚的人民，成批地遭到枪杀和逮捕。非洲人国民大会被宣布为非法，这个组织的领导人和成百的工作人员被投入监狱。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达和其他一些成员，也遭到逮捕。在怯尼亚，三人以上的集会都是“非法”的。在坦噶尼喀，2月中旬，殖民当局利用殖民警察巡逻车遭到袭击的事件，进行了疯狂的报复，不问青红皂白地逮捕了一千五百多名非洲居民。目前，英国在东非和中非的镇压活动仍在继续扩大中。
    除了军事镇压以外，英国还在东非和中非地区继续使用政治欺骗和加强经济控制的手法。许多地区正在进行所谓“大选”。英国垄断资本的代言人打着“英国提供资金和技术，非洲提供资源”和“种族合伙”的幌子，竭力企图扩大对中非东非的掠夺和控制。
    阻止不了火山的爆发
    不管是进行暴力镇压，还是加强政治经济控制，英国殖民者都阻止不了它的宝座下的火山的爆发。
    殖民统治者的屠刀只能使非洲人民更加清醒、更加坚决地投入斗争。阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆和比属刚果人民的斗争都证明了这一条真理。尼亚萨兰人民的大暴动，也证明了这一条真理。英国在尼亚萨兰和中非、东非使用近代化武器的军警镇压手无寸铁的非洲人民，只是反映了英国殖民主义者的孤立和非洲人民的强大。
    所谓“种族合伙”之类的谎言，早已遭到了英属中非和东非人民的唾弃。尼亚萨兰的民族独立运动领袖利奥纳德·契尔瓦远在许多年以前就明确地揭露了这些谎言的目的，只是为了取得高额利润和廉价劳动，只是意味着“非洲人的遗产——非洲的自然资源——遭受蹂躏、土地遭受破坏、劳动遭受剥削、财富遭受抢劫。而这一切都是为了让那些一心一意想把非洲榨干的伦敦或纽约的投机家发财。……这些东西都是我所不需要的，也是任何非洲爱国者所不需要的”。
    不久以前，英国的“泰晤士报”记者说，英属非洲殖民者的“心理状态和那些住在火山斜坡上的人们的心理状态一样。他们现在知道有许多溶岩，但是希望在他们活着的时候不要爆发”。然而，非洲人民用日益有力的实际行动回答了他们：他们的希望落空了。非洲大地的火山正在隆隆作响，喷射着的溶岩翻腾滚沸。（附图片）
