Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. The first Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class graduated on the 25th. Two years and eight months of study have enabled this group of senior Western medicine doctors to master two sets of skills in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine. They can not only initially apply the theories and methods of traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases, but also have made certain achievements in sorting out and studying traditional Chinese medicine from a modern scientific perspective and method.

The first research class consisted of fifty-seven students, all of whom were Western medicine doctors with considerable expertise, from five provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, and Shanghai. After enrolling in June 1956, they spent a year and a half studying the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine, including *Neijing Suwen*, medical history, *Shanghan Lun*, *Jinkui Yaolüe*, *Bencao*, and *Fangji*. The other year was spent in clinical practice in internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, and other departments. During the study period, the method of learning, applying, sorting out, and researching simultaneously was implemented. The students also went to the countryside to participate in labor and the mass movement to eliminate pests and diseases, thus continuously improving the quality of teaching.

In clinical practice, these doctors, equipped with two sets of skills in traditional Chinese and Western medicine, achieved very high curative effects in treating diseases such as silicosis, chronic nephritis, cirrhosis, hypertension, and appendicitis using traditional Chinese medicine methods. When Dr. Cai Jinggao was treating a patient with chronic diarrhea using acupuncture, the patient did not improve much after three treatments. Later, based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, he considered that the disease belonged to spleen deficiency diarrhea, so in the fourth treatment, he added acupuncture to the original point of the spleen meridian. The patient stopped having diarrhea from the second day. When participating in labor in the countryside, they used a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to prevent the spread of influenza and measles in a very short period of time, and also cured a critically ill child with measles and pneumonia with suspected encephalitis who had been convulsing continuously for ten hours. Because of their proper treatment and sincere attitude, the masses constantly sent them letters of thanks.

Since the second half of last year, in conjunction with clinical practice, they have cooperated with traditional Chinese medicine teachers to establish a silicosis research group and a meridian research laboratory, opened an appendicitis ward at the Shanghai 11th People's Hospital, and established research institutions and bases. Within half a year, they completed a total of forty-three research topics and explored ancient traditional Chinese medicine literature. Although hypertension is not named in traditional Chinese medicine literature, the students studied various diseases with hypertension symptoms in the literature and researched two treatment methods and the drugs used: nourishing the kidney and nourishing yin to treat the root cause and clearing the liver and reducing fire to treat the symptoms. They systematically conducted experimental research on meridian phenomena using "meridian measuring instruments," acupuncture, and other methods, proving that certain meridian phenomena do exist. In the research, they also worked with the physiology teaching and research group to improve the "meridian measuring instrument."

Based on clinical practice and scientific research, the students combined theory with practice and used modern scientific methods to sort out and study traditional Chinese medicine. Over the past two years, they have written a total of two hundred and ninety-eight academic papers and summaries of experience. In the article "A Textual Research on *Jinkui Yaolüe*," Zhang Lingxiu compared and analyzed various traditional Chinese medicine disease names and Western medicine disease names, providing valuable reference materials for the future treatment of diseases by both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In his graduation thesis "Jaundice," Zhu Lichao not only scientifically unified the classification of jaundice, but also analyzed the treatment principles and the effects of the drugs used for various types of jaundice, and also proposed the suggestion of using acupuncture in combination with treatment.

At the graduation ceremony of the first Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class, nineteen students including Wu Jingxin received awards from the Ministry of Health. After receiving their graduation certificates, all fifty-seven students unanimously expressed their determination to continue to deeply study traditional Chinese medicine theory, continuously improve their medical level, and strive to become outstanding theorists of traditional Chinese medicine as soon as possible.

    做一个有两套本领的医生
    上海第一届西医学习中医研究班结业
    新华社上海27日电　上海第一届中医研究班25日结业。两年零八个月的学习，使这一批高级西医师掌握了中西医两套本领。他们不但能初步应用中医的理论和方法治疗疾病，而且在以现代科学观点、方法整理和研究祖国医学等方面，也取得了一定的成绩。
    第一届研究班五十七名学员，都是具有相当水平的西医师，他们来自江苏、浙江、安徽、山东、上海等五个省市。从1956年6月入学后，他们以一年半的时间学习了中医内经知要、医学史、伤寒论、金匮要略、本草、方剂等基本理论，其它一年的时间，在内、外、妇、儿等科临床实习。在学习期间，实行了边学、边用、边整理、边研究的办法，学员们还下乡参加劳动，参加群众除害灭病运动，因此教学质量不断提高。
    在临床实习中，这些具备了中西医两套本领的医师们，采用中医办法治疗矽肺、慢性肾炎、肝硬化、高血压、阑尾炎等病症，都获得很高的疗效。蔡景高医师在用针灸治疗一个慢性腹泻的病人时，治疗三次后，病人好转不大，后来根据中医理论考虑到这个病是属于脾虚泄泻，于是在第四次治疗时，加针脾经的原穴，病人从第二日起就不再腹泻。在乡下参加劳动时，他们曾用中西医结合的办法，在很短的时间内防止了流行性感冒和小儿麻疹的流传，并且治好了持续抽搐十小时的麻疹、肺炎并可疑合并脑炎的危急病孩。由于他们治疗得法，态度诚恳，群众不断给他们寄来感谢信。
    从去年下半年开始，结合临床实习，他们与中医老师们合作，成立了矽肺研究小组和经络研究室，在上海市十一人民医院开辟了阑尾炎病房，建立和设立了研究机构和基地。半年内，他们共完成了四十三项研究题，同时探讨了古代中医文献。高血压一病，虽在祖国医学文献上没有这个名称，但学员们钻研文献中所有具有高血压症状的各种疾病，研究出了用滋肾养阴治本和清肝降火治标的两种治疗方法和所用的药物。他们以“经络测定仪”、针灸等方法，系统地对经络现象作了试验研究，证明若干经络现象确实存在。在研究中，他们还同生理教研组一起改进了“经络测定仪”。
    在临床实习以及科学研究的基础上，学员们结合实际，以现代科学方法对祖国医学进行整理和研究。两年多来，他们已经写成学术论文和心得共二百九十八篇。张令锈在“金匮要略考实”一文中，把中医各种病名和西医病名加以比较分析，为今后中西医治疗疾病提供了可贵的参考资料。朱利朝在毕业论文“黄疸”中，不但科学地统一了黄疸的分类，而且分析了各类黄疸的治疗原则和所用药物的作用，同时提出了用针灸配合治疗的建议。
    在第一届中医研究班结业典礼上，学员吴敬新等十九人获得了卫生部发给的奖品。全班五十七个学员领到了毕业证书后，一致表示要继续深入钻研祖国医学理论，不断提高医学水平，争取早日成为祖国医学的高明的理论家。（附图片）
