    Increase Targets, Add Measures, Everyone's Heart is Set on the Heroes' Conference
    Broad Masses of Workers Pledge to Make Great Contributions to the Motherland
    Shenyang
    Over 800,000 workers in Shenyang's industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade systems have held symposiums and skill competitions in recent days, revising their competition targets and guarantee measures, determined to launch a bigger leap forward and welcome the Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction.
    Jiang Hongxun, a worker in the Fourth Workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, has completed the first quarter's production task 35 days ahead of schedule. He is determined to complete five months and ten days of work by the end of March and continue to create greater achievements, striving to go to Beijing to attend the representatives' conference. Lun Fengliang, an engineer at the Shenyang Transformer Factory who was named a city-wide model worker in 1958, excitedly read the newspaper containing the notice from the Party Central Committee and the State Council three times in a row. Then, he immediately ran to the workshop to discuss technological innovation projects with the workers. This engineer, who came from a fitter background, has put forward more than 160 technological innovation suggestions since 1953, partially realizing the mechanization of the originally manual assembly work. To welcome the representatives' conference, he is determined to further mechanize the assembly work by the fourth quarter.
    Harbin
    More than 500,000 workers in Harbin have revised their leap forward plans, determined to create better achievements to welcome the Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction.
    All the workers of the Harbin Boiler Factory, which won the Red Flag Unit in Heilongjiang Province in 1958, proposed to strive to overproduce three more boilers in the last few days of the first quarter and achieve a "red" start to the quarter, and to create greater achievements in the second quarter. The workers of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Group of the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, which has maintained the honor of advanced collective for nine years, have already done thirteen months of work in two and a half months this year. Now they want to strive to do five years of work in one year. The famous labor model, Su Guangming, a milling worker at the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, is determined to always be the master of time, guaranteeing the realization of the plan to complete five years of work in one year.
    Wuhan
    The workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and Daye Steel Plant are determined to use excellent production results to welcome the Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers.
    On the 25th, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace achieved high production from every furnace, creating a new production record since the beginning of this year. Li Feng'en, the famous national advanced producer and director of the blast furnace workshop of Wuhan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant, said: "We are determined to raise and consolidate the daily output of pig iron from No. 1 Blast Furnace to more than 2,000 tons, and do a good job in the production preparation of the new blast furnace, striving to go to Beijing with the collective honor of the Ironmaking Plant to see Chairman Mao." The builders who are building the No. 2 Blast Furnace are determined to complete the entire furnace shell installation project at a faster speed to welcome the opening of the Heroes' Conference.
    The workers of the open-hearth furnace in the First Steelmaking Department of Daye Steel Plant unanimously expressed that they want to learn from Shanghai Steel, catch up with Shanghai Steel, and respond to the call of the Party with greater production achievements. The Luo Yongfa class of No. 4 Open-hearth Furnace now takes about seven and a half hours to smelt each furnace of steel. They strive to shorten it to six and a half hours in April and guarantee that there is no low-temperature steel, and the monthly quality reaches 100%. On the 23rd and 24th, the Zhang Longfan class of No. 3 Open-hearth Furnace used local iron to produce high-quality steel in 5 hours and 52 minutes, 5 hours and 40 minutes, and 5 hours and 27 minutes respectively, shortening the smelting time per furnace by about 3 hours compared with using foreign iron in February, setting a new record since the opening of the furnace. On the 25th, this class held a meeting to summarize the experience and determined to consolidate the smelting time of each furnace of steel to about 5 hours and 30 minutes.
    Guangzhou
    Workers of various factories and enterprises in Guangzhou are revising their leap forward plans and measures, determined to create greater achievements in production to welcome the Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction.
    The workers of the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant were all excited after hearing the news and put forward new production targets separately. The workers of the steelmaking workshop proposed: In April, the number of daily blowing furnaces of converter steel should be increased from the current average of 18 furnaces to 80 furnaces. The workers of the ironmaking workshop proposed that the daily output of iron should be increased from the current level of about 120 tons to 160 tons in the second quarter. The Guangzhou Paper Mill, which initiated an inter-factory competition with large paper mills across the country, had two-thirds of its employees hold production group meetings separately to re-formulate more advanced targets and effective measures.
