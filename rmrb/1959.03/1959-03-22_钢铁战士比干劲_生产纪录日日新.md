From our newspaper in Tianjin, March 21st: After the national broadcast conference on high-yield and high-quality competition for steel workers, the "Quarter-Hour Competition" being carried out by the workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant's Section Steel Plant has entered its most heated stage.

The plant's workers, based on discussions of the annual plan, have re-formulated the high-yield, high-quality plan for the second quarter. They proposed measures to reduce downtime and increase production efficiency, and added many suggestions for technological innovation. The planned hourly output of the billet section alone for the second quarter was increased by 20% compared to the original plan. After the plan was finalized, the workers were full of energy, and the various teams competed with each other, with new production records rising one after another. The rolling mill of the Second Small Section Steel Plant is turning even faster, and the work songs in the workshop rise and fall. On the 18th, they accepted the task of rolling light steel rails for supporting use in factories and mines in other areas. The original plan was for a production of 23 tons per eight-hour shift, but on the 19th, the C shift workers on the night shift first surpassed the plan with a new record of 43 tons in the "Quarter-Hour Competition," with a quality rate of 99.57%, winning the "Quarter-Hour Competition" championship. The morning shift workers who took over on the morning of the 20th exceeded the C shift's output with a production of 57 tons, which was two and a half times the planned amount. The B shift workers who went to work at noon strengthened the quarter-hour inspections, established a post responsibility system, and eliminated downtime. As a result, they surpassed the previous two shifts with an absolute advantage of 59 tons of production, with a quality rate of 99.77%. After the C shift workers went to work that night, veteran worker Wang Shutang created a new record of rolling 55 steel rails every quarter of an hour with fast, steady, and accurate operating methods. At present, the workers' enthusiasm is even higher, and they are determined to break the 60-ton mark for shift production.

    钢铁战士比干劲
    生产纪录日日新
    本报天津21日电　全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会之后，天津钢厂型钢厂的职工正在开展着的“刻钟竞赛”，进入了最热烈的阶段。
    这个厂的职工在讨论全年计划的基础上重新制订了第二季度的高产优质的计划，他们提出减少中断时间、提高生产效率的措施，补充了很多技术革新的建议。仅开坯工段第二季度每小时产量的计划，就比原计划提高了20％。计划确定之后，职工们干劲冲天，各个班组之间你追我赶，新的生产纪录一浪高过一浪。第二小型工段的轧钢机转动的更快，车间里的劳动号子此起彼落，他们在18日接受了支援外地工矿用的轻便钢轨轧制任务，原计划每班八小时的产量是二十三吨，但19日上夜班的丙班工人在
  “刻钟竞赛”中，首先以班产四十三吨的新纪录超过了计划，质量达到了99.57％，获得了“刻钟竞赛”的冠军。20日早晨接班的早班工人，又以班产五十七吨超过计划二倍半的成绩，超过了丙班。中午上班的乙班工人加强了刻钟检查，建立了岗位负责制，消灭了中断时间，结果又以班产五十九吨的绝对优势，超过了前二班，质量达到99.77％。这天晚上丙班工人上班以后，老工人王树堂以快、稳、准的操作方法，创造了每刻钟轧五十五根钢轨的新纪录。目前，工人们的情绪更加高涨，决心突破班产六十吨的大关。
