    I Earned the Nickname "Old Huang"
    Huang Ping, Secretary of the CCP Nankang County Committee
    I was in the first group of cadres from Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, sent down to Shangluo Brigade to be a commune member. On the first day I was sent down, I was assigned to dig up saplings on the mountain. That day, I walked a lot, and the commune members were all discussing me. Commune member Ouyang Kexin said, "Seeing that you are already forty or fifty years old, why are you still coming down to do manual labor!" Actually, on the first day of labor, I didn't feel too tired.
    After a period of participating in productive labor, I wrote another application to the team, requesting to do some work as a cook or a feeder. The team leader agreed. At that time, several commune members nearby were surprised and said, "Secretary Huang, you are going to do these very dirty things?"
    The cook's work began. That night, I thought about the issue of saving grain. I thought, the higher authorities are calling on everyone to save grain. In addition to preventing waste, the cooking work should also find ways to improve the rice yield. I consulted with the old cooks, and they said that "cooking inverted soup rice" could improve the rice yield. So I led everyone to conduct experiments. As a result, every twenty catties of rice yielded seven more catties of cooked rice. This canteen eats more than six hundred catties of rice every day, so it can produce more than two hundred catties of cooked rice. After implementing this method, the township Party committee was very satisfied and promptly convened an on-site meeting to summarize and promote this experience. I also thought that boiling porridge must also be able to improve the rice yield, so I discussed it with commune member Ouyang Feng. He said that using a mill to crush the rice, and cooking the coarse grains first until they are tender, then mixing in the crushed powder can produce more porridge. We conducted another experiment, and as a result, six catties of rice could produce more than ten catties of porridge. After these good news spread, the commune members praised it incessantly. In fact, the achievement of these results mainly relies on the power of the masses. As long as you humbly learn from the masses and discuss things with the masses, the methods of the masses are endless.
    I went to raise pigs again. This small team raised seventy-three pigs. That day, the team leader took me to the pig farm. The feeders were very enthusiastic to me, but they were also surprised. They were considerate of me, letting me manage chopping pig feed and cooking pig feed in the pig farm, not feeding the pigs. But I still rushed to do it. The commune members were very moved and discussed this matter. This made me deeply feel that if cadres go down to be commune members, as long as they put down their airs, closely link with the masses, and humbly learn from the masses, how much the masses will love you!
    When I was working as a cook, I got up at three o'clock every morning to cook rice, and I also rested late at night. After a few days, I felt that I couldn't mentally support it anymore. Once, when the team was holding a meeting, I sat on a stool and vaguely wanted to sleep. I immediately woke up, but I also felt very embarrassed, so I smoked one cigarette after another to persevere. This incident made me deeply realize that hard work and practical work are very important, but attention to necessary rest is also necessary.
    After more than twenty days of labor, the commune members' way of addressing me changed. When I first arrived at the team, the men, women, old, and young in the commune all called me Commissar Huang. After eating, living, and working together, a deep relationship was established between each other. The commune members gradually changed from calling me Commissar Huang to calling me Comrade Huang Ping, and finally simply called me Old Huang. The title of Old Huang is the result of my more than twenty days of labor. Whenever I hear this title, I feel very happy.

    我取得了“老黄”的称呼
    中共南康县委书记　黄平
    我是江西省南康县第一批下放到上洛大队当社员的。下放的第一天，我被分配去山上挖树苗。这天我跑了很多路，社员们都在议论我。社员欧阳克信说：“看你今年有四、五十岁了，怎么还下来劳动啊！”其实第一天的劳动，我并不感到太累。
    生产劳动一段时间，我又向队里写了申请，要求搞搞炊事员、饲养员的工作。队长同意了，当时在旁边的几位社员都惊奇地说：“黄书记，这些很脏的事你也要去做吗？”
    炊事员的工作开始了。当天晚上我想起了节约粮食的问题。我想，上级号召大家要节约粮食，炊事工作除了防止浪费外，还应该找窍门提高出饭率。我找到了老炊事员商量，他们说“煮倒汤饭”是可以提高出饭率的。我便领着大家进行了试验，结果每二十斤米增加了七斤饭。这个食堂每天吃六百多斤米，就可多出二百多斤饭。实行这个办法后，乡党委很满意，及时召开现场会议，总结推广了这个经验。我又想到煮稀饭也一定能提高出饭率，便和社员欧阳凤研究，他说，用磨把米碾碎，煮饭时先将粗的煮烂，再将碎粉冲入就可以多出饭。我们又进行了试验，结果六斤米可以多出十斤多稀饭。这些喜讯传出后，社员们赞扬不绝。其实这些成绩的取得，主要是靠群众的力量。只要虚心向群众学习，有事与群众商量，群众的办法是无穷无尽的。
    我又去养猪了。这个小队养了七十三头猪，那天队长带我到了养猪场，饲养员们对我很热情，但又感到很惊奇。他们体贴我，让我在养猪场管剁猪食，煮猪食，不去喂猪。但我还是抢着去做了，社员们很受感动，纷纷议论着这件事。这就使我深深地感到，干部下放当社员，只要放下架子，紧紧和群众联系在一起，虚心向群众学习，群众是多么爱戴你啊！
    在当炊事员的时候，每天早晨三点钟就起床煮饭，夜里又休息得较晚，几天以后，精神上有些支持不住了。有一次队里开会，我坐在凳子上迷迷糊糊想要睡觉。我立时惊觉起来，但也感到很难为情，便一支接一支地抽烟，才坚持下来了。这件事使我深刻体会到，苦干、实干是很重要的，但注意必要的休息也是应该的。
    二十多天的劳动，社员们对我的称呼改变了。刚到队里的时候，社里的男女老少都叫我黄政委，经过同吃、同住、同劳动以后，彼此间便建立了深厚的感情，社员们由叫黄政委逐渐改叫黄平同志，最后干脆就叫我老黄了。老黄这个称号，是我二十多天劳动的成果，每当我听到这个称号，心里非常高兴。
