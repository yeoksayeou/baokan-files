Carrying on the Past and Opening up the Future
Yang Ling

The wheat seedlings are growing so vigorously this year! Looking at the lush wheat seedlings that are now turning green and jointing, looking at the crowds of people "embroidering" and "weaving brocade" on the land, we can foresee a bumper harvest this summer—looking further ahead, we can also foresee a bumper harvest this autumn.

When spring had just returned to the world, we paid special attention to striving for a bumper harvest in summer; this is not only because it is the first harvest of the year, nor only because wheat is an important part of our livelihood, but also because the victory of the "first battle" has a significant effect on the victory of the "entire campaign" in terms of boosting morale and gaining experience.

In the spring fields, many good experiences, as fresh and vigorous as the wheat seedlings, have already grown up.

Large-scale mass movements are closely integrated with detailed technical measures and strict responsibility systems. Experimental plots have driven large areas of high-yield fields, and high-yield fields have driven larger areas of wheat fields. According to the growth laws of wheat and the different times, places, and conditions, the "Eight-Character Charter" is applied comprehensively and with emphasis. These are the characteristics of this spring's wheat field management work, and can also be said to be the basic experiences of this spring's wheat field management work.

These experiences all have new content and are the development of some important experiences from last year; they are new developments in mass movements, leadership methods, and production technology. Without last year's bumper harvest and last year's experience, there would be no better wheat fields and better experience this year. To have an even bigger bumper harvest this year, we must continue to carry forward last year's experience.

The relationship between this year and last year is like this; the relationship between the next season and the previous season is also like this. Last year's bumper summer harvest drove the year's bumper harvest; this year, we should be more aware of the law of "promoting autumn with summer," continue to carry forward the experience of wheat field management, do a better job in spring plowing and sowing, and strive for an even bigger autumn harvest.

Hua County, Henan, put forward a slogan: Use the experience of wheat field management to vigorously promote early autumn high-yield fields, and drive the overall spring plowing and production movement. They timely summarized the experience of vigorously developing high-yield wheat fields and immediately applied it to striving for an early autumn harvest, and made a plan for early autumn high-yield fields. The practice of early autumn high-yield fields is a further step than that of high-yield wheat fields: not only to realize the gardenization of cultivation, the regionalization of planting, the specialization of management, and the fixation of responsibility, but also to set up eight fields and seven stations in the high-yield fields (scientific experiment field, fine variety breeding field, manure accumulation and fertilizer production field, livestock breeding field, pig raising field, tool manufacturing and repair field, sports field, fish farming field (set up in rice high-yield fields), technology promotion station, simple weather station, livestock breeding station, medical station, cultural station, broadcasting station, and life service station); each field must establish files, and each experiment must register cards; it is necessary to check and evaluate the preparation work for sowing as early as possible, and if it is not done well, immediately process it, and "eliminate the three types of land before sowing"... In the practice of Hua County, we can clearly see the red flag of "continuous revolution" flying.

Carrying on the past and opening up the future—continuously inheriting and continuously developing; not severing history and never being complacent. In this way, our experience can become more and more rich and colorful.

    继往开来
    杨岭
    今年的麦苗长得真欢！望着正在返青、拔节的繁茂的麦苗，望着正在大地上“绣花”“织锦”的人群，可以望见今年夏季的大丰收——再向前望去，还可以望见今年秋季的大丰收。
    春天刚回到人间的时候，我们就特别注意争取夏季大丰收；这不光因为它是今年的第一季收获，也不光因为麦子是我们重要的生活物资，还因为“初战”的胜利，就鼓舞士气和取得经验等方面来说，对“全役”的胜利都有重大的作用。
    在春天的田野上，已经有许多好经验同麦苗一样清新而又旺盛地生长起来了。
    大规模的群众运动同细致的技术措施和严密的责任制度紧密地结合了起来。试验田带动了大面积的丰产方，丰产方带动了更大面积的麦田。按照麦子的生长规律和时间、地点、条件的不同，既全面而又有重点地运用“八字宪法”。——这些都是今春麦田管理工作的特点，也可以说是今春麦田管理工作的基本经验。
    这些经验都有着新的内容，是去年的一些重要经验的发展；是在群众运动、领导方法、生产技术上新的发展。没有去年的丰收和去年的经验，就没有今年的更好的麦田、更好的经验。今年要有更大的丰收，也一定要继续发扬去年的经验。
    今年和去年之间的关系是如此；下季和上季之间的关系也是如此。去年的夏季大丰收带动了全年的大丰收；今年，应该更有意识地掌握“以夏促秋”的规律，继续发扬麦田管理的经验，把春耕春播工作做得更出色，争取秋季更大丰收。
    河南滑县提出了一个口号：运用麦田管理经验，大搞早秋丰产方，带动全面的春耕生产运动。他们及时地总结了大搞小麦丰产方的经验，并立即运用在争取早秋丰收上，作出了早秋丰产方的规划。早秋丰产方的做法比小麦丰产方更进了一步：不仅要实现耕作园田化、种植区域化、管理专业化、责任固定化，而且在丰产方内要设八场七站（科学试验场、优良品种培育场、积肥制肥场、牲畜饲养场、养猪场、工具制造修配场、运动场、养鱼场（水稻丰产方内设置），技术推广站、简易气象站、牲畜配种站、医疗站、文化站、广播站、生活服务站）；每方都要建立档案，每种试验都要登记卡片；要及早检查评比各项播种准备工作，做得不够的立即加工，要“把三类地消灭在播种之前”……在滑县的做法中，我们可以清楚地看到“不断革命”的红旗在飘扬。
    继往开来——不断继承，又不断发展；不割断历史，又永不自满。这样，我们的经验才能够越来越丰富多采。
