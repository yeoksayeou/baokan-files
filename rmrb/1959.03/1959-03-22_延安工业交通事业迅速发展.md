The industrial and transportation construction in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an is developing rapidly with the force of a sudden rise, changing the economic face of this old revolutionary base. According to the preliminary plan for the development of industry and transportation in the Yan'an area by the Yan'an Commissioner's Office this year, the total industrial output value of the Yan'an area this year will increase by another 103% on the basis of doubling in 1958.

In 1958, a total of 11,670 large and small factories were newly built in the Yan'an area, and more than 40 new industrial products were added, including steel, pig iron, synthetic petroleum, cement, fertilizers, pesticides, ball bearings, and sugar. Last year, Yan'an Prefecture also conducted a comprehensive exploration of mineral resources and found that almost every county in the prefecture has iron, coal, oil shale and other mineral deposits that can be mined. The proven iron reserves in the entire region amount to more than 1.335 billion tons; except for Zhidan County, every county has oil shale deposits with high oil content. These discoveries broke the old belief that northern Shaanxi was poor in mineral resources.

This year, the investment in industrial capital construction in Yan'an Prefecture has increased more than threefold compared to last year, and most of the investment will first be used to establish a number of key factories in the iron, coal, synthetic petroleum, and machinery industries. A number of small blast furnaces have been built in Hejiagou in Yan'an County, Yijiaping in Zichang County, and Zhangcunyi in Luochuan County last year, and these will gradually be built into three iron smelting bases in the prefecture. Yan'an, Zichang, and Huangling counties, which have abundant and high-quality coal reserves, will also successively establish three coal industrial bases with an annual output of 100,000 to 200,000 tons. The output of the original natural oil field—Yanchang Oil Mine—will be doubled this year compared to last year. A large number of small-scale oil refineries using indigenous methods will be developed this year in Zichang, Yan'an, Huangling, and Luochuan counties, which have abundant synthetic petroleum resources. A general machinery factory with an annual output of 3,500 tons of equipment began construction in Yan'an last year and is now producing while building the factory. This year, Yan'an area will also vigorously develop the production of indigenous machine tools, so that each people's commune will have five indigenous machine tools to arm the commune's agricultural machinery repair shops. Other light industries such as textiles, papermaking, grain processing, and sugar will also have new developments on the original basis this year.

In order to meet the needs of economic development and rapidly change the inconvenient transportation situation, Yan'an Prefecture built more than 800 kilometers of new roads last year, and will build 1,400 kilometers of new roads this year. In addition, 6,000 kilometers of roads for large vehicles and carts will be built, forming a more complete road transportation network in the entire prefecture. (Attached picture)

    延安工业交通事业迅速发展
    本报讯　革命圣地延安地区的工业交通建设正以异军突起之势迅速发展，改变着这个革命老根据地的经济面貌。根据延安专署今年全年发展工业交通事业的初步规划，延安地区今年的工业总产值将在1958年翻了一番的基础之上，再猛增103％。
    1958年延安地区新建起来的大小工厂共有一万一千六百七十个，新增加的工业产品有钢、生铁、人造石油、水泥、化肥、农药、滚珠轴承、食糖等四十多种。去年延安专区还对矿产资源作了一次全面的踏勘，发现全专区几乎县县都有可以开采的铁、煤、油母页岩等矿藏。全区已查明的铁的储量就有十三亿三千五百多万吨；除志丹县外，县县都有含油量较高的油母页岩矿。这些发现，打破了过去有人认为陕北矿产资源贫瘠的说法。
    今年延安专区工业基本建设的投资比去年增加了三倍多，大部投资将首先用于建立一批铁、煤、人造石油和机械等工业方面的骨干工厂。去年在延安县的何家沟，子长县的奕家坪和洛川县的一张村驿三地已建起一批小高炉，这里将逐步建成专区的三个炼铁基地。煤储量既多，质量也好的延安、子长和黄陵三县，也将陆续建立起三个年产十万到二十万吨的煤炭工业基地。原有的天然油矿——延长油矿的产量今年将比去年增加两倍。人造石油资源很多的子长、延安、黄陵和洛川四县，今年将发展一大批土法炼油厂。一个年产设备三千五百吨的通用机械厂从去年开始在延安筹建，现在正一面生产一边建厂。今年延安地区还要大力发展土机床生产，做到每个人民公社有土机床五台，把公社的农业机械修配厂武装起来。纺织、造纸、粮食加工、食糖等其他轻工业，今年也将在原有基础上有新的发展。
    为适应经济发展的需要，迅速改变交通不便情况，延安专区去年新建了八百多公里的公路，今年还将新建公路一千四百公里，并且要修建大车和架子车路六千公里，全专区内将构成一个更完备的公路运输网。（附图片）
