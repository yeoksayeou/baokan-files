    Heroic Women Fighting on the Perilous Yellow River
    ——Remembering the Women Builders of Sanmenxia
    By our reporter Zhang Lijun

    In the pivotal project of conquering the first natural barrier of the Yellow River – the construction of the Sanmenxia water conservancy project – women, like men, drive bulldozers to move mountains and reclaim land, drive heavy trucks at high speed, open mountains on cliffs or fight against raging waves; some, like housewives, make precise plans to ensure that every building material is used rationally and maximizes its effectiveness. Every foundation stone, every steel bar, and every cubic meter of concrete in the Sanmenxia Dam contains the crystallization of their hard work.

        Fighting Against Raging Waves

    Female welder Tian Su-zhi is one of those who fought against the raging waves of the Yellow River. That was during the most critical period of the gate column project of the Shenmen spillway during the days of river closure.

    During the flood season last year, the first flood peak washed away a 600-ton gate pier of the Shenmen spillway, which brought great difficulties to the progress of the project. If the gate pier was to be restored, another dry season would have to be waited for, so it was decided to insert a row of reinforced concrete pipe columns into the riverbed to block the stones thrown down like a fence, and finally block the river channel. However, the isolated pipe columns could not withstand the impact of the river water. The river closure headquarters accepted the opinion of the old river workers and decided to use two steel rails to clamp the fourteen pipe columns, and insert the two ends of the steel rails into the solid rock of Shenmen Island. In this way, the pipe columns, steel rails and rocks were connected into a whole, which could smoothly block the river channel.

    Everything was ready, and four welders were needed to weld the steel rails and pipe columns together. Tian Su-zhi was so happy when she heard the news that her heart was about to jump out. She said to the welding squad leader Zhang Shulin, "I want to participate in the river closure!" Zhang Shulin thought: Welding while standing on top of the pipe columns, with the turbulent Yellow River rapids beneath your feet, even young and strong male workers need to be bold to do this. How could this little girl go?

    In the past, for high-altitude operations, he never assigned female welders to go. Tian Su-zhi insisted on going to high altitudes, saying: Squad leader Zhang only knows how to take care of us, and in the future, it will all be high-altitude operations, so what are we supposed to do? We should be allowed to train. This time, Tian Su-zhi insisted again: What if it is water operation? What men can do, I can do too. The next day, Tian Su-zhi and three male welders, each with a rope tied around their waists, took the welding machine from the steel cable suspension bridge erected on Shenmen Island to the pipe columns. Although the pipe columns under her feet trembled from the impact of the rapids, and the raging waves frantically rushed towards her, Tian Su-zhi ignored all of this. She pulled down her mask and started working. The waves wet the mask, she took it off, wiped it, and put it back on; her gloves were wet, so she took off her gloves and continued to work; there was no dry place on her body to wipe her hands, but she still insisted on welding. On the steel cable suspension bridge, Zhang Shulin saw that Xiao Tian was soaked all over, and transferred her up to rest. Tian Su-zhi said: No need to transfer, I will work until the end of the shift.

    When she completed the welding task and was pulled onto the suspension bridge, someone who liked to joke said to her: Xiao Tian, did you fall into the Yellow River? She seemed to have completed the greatest accomplishment of her life, and ran back to the dormitory easily with a smile. At this time, she realized that her hands and feet were a little numb with cold.

    When Tian Su-zhi came to Sanmenxia from Guanting in August 1957, she was just an apprentice who had only studied for a few months. In just over a year, she was already a small master leading three apprentices. Due to her outstanding work, she was rated as an advanced producer in 1958; in December last year, she was approved to be a glorious Communist Party member.

        Two "Mu Guiying"

    Like Tian Su-zhi, there are more than thirty young women in the bulldozer team. When they go to work, they all tightly wrap their hair in hats, wear oil-stained work clothes, wipe machines, carry oil drums, and rush to do any work. Except for the sound of their voices, it is difficult to tell whether they are male or female. But after work, the long braids are revealed, and the floral clothes are put on; they dance and sing, and each one is so lively.

    Sun Shu-ying and Gou Qing-e are two famous "Mu Guiying" in the bulldozer team. They were both trainees who came from Guanting at the end of 1956. Now they have been promoted to drivers who independently master a locomotive and have begun to take apprentices themselves.

    Sun Shu-ying is strong and powerful. She is the only female driver in the entire team who drives a 160-horsepower bulldozer. Ordinary people cannot even move its operating lever! Gou Qing-e is petite and exquisite. When she sits in the carriage, she is barely visible! But when you go to that work surface, if you mention "Little Gouzi," people will give you a thumbs up. She is an advanced producer who overfulfills her tasks every shift.

    Gou Qing-e said that she was sweating profusely when she first got on the locomotive. Her master, Ye Cheng, was one of the eighteen warriors during the closure of the Guanting Reservoir. Seeing her panicked appearance, Ye Cheng said: "I was born a shepherd, and I have never read a book, but the Party is determined to cultivate me, so I am determined to learn, and as a result, I still learned it. If I am an example, you can rest assured to learn." Under Ye Cheng's patient training, Gou Qing-e grew up. Now, Gou Qing-e's method of training apprentices is also Ye Cheng's method, teaching them hand in hand. The atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving apprentices between them has become a model for the entire team.

    Sun Shu-ying's physical strength, wit, bravery is praised by the whole team. During the river closure, all roads had to obey the needs of the river closure. The pouring of the right wing of the dam had to open another road from the hillside to transport concrete. Sun Shu-ying's locomotive was responsible for pioneering the road. The hillside was covered with stone debris from blasting. The technician was sweating for Sun Shu-ying when he saw her driving to push the stone debris on such a steep slope and such a narrow road. Sun Shu-ying thought: If the car drives over, it is very likely to fall down the slope. It is a small matter if I fall down alone, but it will affect the progress of the project. Therefore, we must be bold and careful to ensure the successful completion of the task. If the big stones cannot be pulled out or pushed, the usual method is to blast them smaller and then push them, but blasting will affect the river closure. Sun Shu-ying said: Try tying a steel wire rope to the back of the bulldozer and pulling it. The experiment was successful. It was her locomotive that persisted for two or three months, and it was her, a female driver, who opened up this important road.

    After the river water in the foundation pit on the right bank was drained, a battle to clear the silt was launched. It was very difficult to dig up the silt, so the Party branch did not let the female comrades participate. But Sun Shu-ying went quietly. When carrying silt, she specially looked for strong male workers to carry it together.

    Someone asked her: Where do you get such great enthusiasm?

    Sun Shu-ying said: Communist Party members are the servants of the people, and they should use as much strength as they have.

        Invisible Bridges

    At the Sanmenxia construction site, you can often encounter some young women in military uniforms who are working as translators with Soviet experts. Most of them are a group of junior high or high school students who joined the army during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in 1951. They were transferred to Sanmenxia on "March 8th" Women's Day in 1957. Because they have a deep affection for the army, they like to wear military uniforms in spring, summer, autumn and winter, and they are particularly conspicuous when there are many people.

    The Sanmenxia project was designed by the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Institute of the Soviet Union. From design to construction, there are many design plans, measures, and drawings to be translated; during the construction process, Soviet experts of various specialties continue to come to the construction site to guide in person, which is also inseparable from translation work, and they have become a vital force in the translation work of Sanmenxia.

    In early October 1957, Soviet expert and Chief Mechanical Engineer Lakhno came to Sanmenxia. This is an old engineer with decades of rich experience. The organization assigned Wang Hui-zhen to be his translator. When she met the expert for the first time, Wang Hui-zhen explained to the expert that her Russian foundation was very poor, and her knowledge of mechanical technology was even less. She asked the expert to provide specific assistance in future work.

    The work covers a wide range. In addition to some basic knowledge, she mainly relies on learning in the work. There are many new problems, and it is often possible to encounter things that are encountered for the first time. Wang Hui-zhen always tries to prepare in advance, check relevant reference books to familiarize herself with professional knowledge, and prepare specialized terms that may be used; or try to get the expert to tell her once in advance. Wang Hui-zhen said: There is no opportunity to systematically learn a major, so I have to learn it clearly when I encounter any problems, from not understanding to understanding. Sometimes it may delay the expert's time a little, but the expert is very willing to do so. When she does not understand, the expert often uses drawings to illustrate, and does not let go of every small problem. Because the expert knows that explaining it to her clearly can better achieve the purpose of the work.

    In the translation work, Wang Hui-zhen requires accuracy in every term. Once at the construction site, the expert mentioned that he wanted to use a "crowbar." This word in Russian can be interpreted as "a pile of garbage" or "a steel bar" and other interpretations, and Wang Hui-zhen had only learned the interpretation of "a pile of garbage" in the past. This does not make sense. Finally, the object was found at the construction site. Wang Hui-zhen asked the workers what it was called before accurately translating the expert's meaning. Sometimes, the terms are not consistent with the terms commonly used by workers, and even the names of southern workers and northern workers are different. She tries to understand the terms used by the workers first, so that the workers can understand them kindly and easily.

    Because of Wang Hui-zhen's diligence and detailed questioning, in just over a year, not only has her Russian translation level improved rapidly, but she is also quite familiar with a set of professional knowledge in hydraulic engineering, especially the knowledge of construction machinery. Wang Hui-zhen said: Every translator comrade here has the same situation as me. They have also made great efforts for the construction of Sanmenxia. They are invisible bridges connecting the friendship between the Soviet Union and China.

    奋战在天险黄河上的女英雄
    ——记三门峡的女建设者
    本报记者　张丽君
    在征服黄河的第一个天险——建设三门峡水利的枢纽工程中，妇女和男子一样，开着推土机移山填海，驾驶着载重汽车飞驰，在悬崖峭壁上开山或者在惊涛骇浪上搏斗；也有的像持家的主妇一样作着精密的计划，使每一件建筑材料，都能合理使用，发挥它最大的效用。三门峡大坝的每一块基石，每一根钢筋，每一方混凝土，都包含有她们心血的结晶。
        和惊涛骇浪搏斗
    女电焊工田素芝就是在黄河的惊涛骇浪上搏斗过的一个。那是在截流的日子里，神门泄水道管柱工程进展得最紧张的时候。
    去年汛期，第一个洪峰就把神门泄水道的一个六百吨重的闸墩冲倒了，这给工程进展带来很大的困难。如果要恢复闸墩，必须等待另一个枯水季节，所以就决定在河槽上插一排钢筋混凝土的管柱，让它们像栅栏一样挡住抛掷下去的石块，最后堵住河道。但是，孤零零的一根根管柱，无法承受河水的冲击，截流指挥部接受了老河工的意见，决定用两根钢轨把十四根管柱夹住，钢轨的两头插进神门岛坚固的岩石里。这样，将管柱、钢轨和岩石就联结成一个整体，就可顺利堵塞河道。
    一切都停当了，需要四个电焊工把钢轨和管柱焊接起来。田素芝听着这个消息高兴得心都要蹦出来了。她对电焊班长张树林说：“我要参加截流！”张树林这样想：悬空着站在管柱顶上焊接，脚下就是浪涛翻滚的黄河激流，青壮年男工也真要挑几个大胆的。这么个小姑娘怎么能去呢？
    以前，有高空作业，他也总不分配女电焊工去。田素芝却坚持要上高空，说：张班长就知道照顾照顾，以后尽是高空作业，那叫我们干啥？应该让我们锻炼锻炼。这次，田素芝又坚持说：水上操作又怎么样？男的能做我也能做。第二天，田素芝和三个男电焊工一起，各人腰里都拴上一根绳子，带着电焊机从架设在神门岛上的钢索吊桥上到管柱上去。虽然，脚下的管柱被激流冲击得发颤，汹涌咆哮的波涛疯狂地向她扑来，这一切，田素芝都置之不顾。她把面罩往下一拉，就开始工作了。浪把面罩打湿了，她摘下来，擦一擦，再戴上；手套湿了，就脱了手套干；全身上下已经没有一块干的地方可以擦手了，她仍坚持焊接。钢索吊桥上，张树林看见小田浑身上下都湿透了，调她上来休息。田素芝说：不用调，一班干到底。
    等到她完成焊接任务被拉上吊桥时，爱开玩笑的人对她说：小田，你掉进黄河里去了吧！她却像是完成了一件平生最大的快事，浑身轻松，笑着跑回宿舍去了。这时候，她才发觉自己的手脚冻得有点麻木了。
    田素芝在1957年8月从官厅来三门峡时，还只是一个刚刚学习了几个月的学徒工，仅仅一年多的时间，她已经是带领三个学徒工的小师傅了。由于她出色的劳动，她被评为1958年的先进生产者；去年12月，她被批准为光荣的共产党员了。
        两个“穆桂英”
    和田素芝一样的女青年，在推土机队有三十多个。上班的时候，一个个都把头发紧紧地裹在帽子里，穿着沾满油污的工作服，擦机器，抬油筒，什么活都抢着干。除了说话的声音，简直分辨不出是男是女。可是一下了班，长辫子露出来了，花衣服穿起来了；又舞蹈又唱歌，一个个又那么活泼。
    孙树英和勾清娥是推土机队两个出名的“穆桂英”。她们都是1956年底从官厅来的学员，现在已经提拔为独立掌握一台机车的司机，并且自己开始带徒弟了。
    孙树英健壮有力。全队女司机中就她一个开一百六十马力的推土机，一般人连它的操纵杆都搬不动呢！勾清娥长得小巧玲珑，坐在车厢里，还不露头呢！可是你到那个工作面，一提“小勾子”，人家都会伸大拇指。她是班班超额完成任务的先进生产者。
    勾清娥说，她第一次上机车的时候，急得满身是汗。她的师傅叶成，是官厅水库截流时的十八勇士之一。叶成见她那种慌张样子，就说：“我是个放羊倌出身，一天书也没念过，可是党决心培养我，我就下决心学，结果还是学会了。我要是个例子，你们就安心学习。”在叶成的耐心培养下，勾清娥成长起来了。现在，勾清娥带徒弟也是叶成的办法，把着手教。她们之间尊师爱徒的风气成了全队的典范。
    孙树英的体力和机智、勇敢是全队称道的。截流的时候，所有的公路都要服从截流的需要，大坝右翼的浇筑，必须另从山坡上开出一条公路来运送混凝土。孙树英这个机车就担任了开路先锋。山坡上复盖着爆破下来的石碴。坡那么陡，路那么窄，技术员看着孙树英开车去推石碴，都为她捏一把汗。孙树英想：车开过去吧，很可能掉下坡去，我一个人掉下去了还是小事，可是就影响了工程的进展。所以必须胆大心细，保证顺利成完任务。遇到大石块扒不出来，也推不动，按照通常的办法，就是把它爆破得小一点再推，可是爆破要影响截流。孙树英说：用钢丝绳拴在推土机后面拉一拉看。一试验果然行。就是她这个机车一直坚持了两三个月，而且就是她一个女司机，把这条要道打通了。
    右岸基坑的河水抽干以后，展开了一场清理淤泥的战斗。淤泥挖起来很费劲，所以党支部没让女同志去参加。可是孙树英悄悄地去了。抬淤泥还专门找体力强的男壮工一起抬。
    有人问她：你那来这么大的干劲？
    孙树英说：共产党员就是人民的勤务员，有多大力量就使多大力量。
        无形的桥梁
    在三门峡工地，经常可以碰到一些穿着军装的女青年，跟苏联专家作翻译。她们大多是1951年抗美援朝的时候参军的一批初中或高中学生。1957年“三八”节那天转业来到三门峡。她们因为对部队有着深厚的感情，所以春夏秋冬四季都喜欢穿着军衣，人数一多就特别显眼。
    三门峡工程是苏联列宁格勒水电设计分院设计的，从设计到施工，有很多设计方案、措施、图纸要翻译；在建设过程中，各类专业的苏联专家还不断地来工地亲临指导，也离不开翻译工作，她们就成了三门峡翻译工作上的一支生力军。
    1957年10月初，苏联专家、总机械工程师拉赫诺来三门峡了。这是一位有几十年丰富经验的老工程师了。组织上分配王慧珍去为他担任翻译。和专家第一次见面，王慧珍就向专家说明自己的俄语基础很差，至于机械技术知识那就更少了。她请求专家在以后工作里给予具体帮助。
    工作涉及的面很广，除了一些基本知识以外，她主要是靠工作中去学习。新的问题很多，而且经常可能遇到第一次接触到的东西。王慧珍总是尽可能地事先作准备，查有关参考书熟悉专业知识，准备好可能用到的专门名词；或者争取专家先给她讲一次。王慧珍说：没有机会系统地学专业，那只有碰到什么问题时就把它学清楚，从不懂到懂。有的时候可能耽误专家一点时间，专家却很愿意这样做。在她听不懂时，专家还经常用图纸来说明，每一个小问题都不放过。因为专家知道对她讲清楚了，可以更好地达到工作的目的。
    在翻译工作中，王慧珍在每一个名词上都要求准确。有一次在工地，专家提到要用一根“橇棍”。这个词俄文可以作“一堆垃圾”或者是“一根铁条”等几种解释，而王慧珍过去只学过“一堆垃圾”这个解释。这样就讲不通了。最后在工地上找来实物。王慧珍问了工人叫什么，才把专家准确的意思翻译出来了。有时候，名词和工人习惯用的术语不一致，甚至南方工人和北方工人叫法也不一样。她尽量先了解工人们用的术语，使工人听起来亲切易懂。
    由于王慧珍的勤学、细问，所以仅仅一年多的时间，她不仅俄语翻译水平提高很快，对水工建筑工程上的一套专业知识，特别是施工机械方面的知识，她都相当熟悉了。王慧珍说：我们这里每个翻译同志都有我同样的情况。她们为三门峡的建设同样付出了巨大的劳动。她们是联结着苏联和中国友谊的无形的桥梁。
