    Fluorite – A True Gem
    Liu Feng
    In recent years, a truly valuable "gem" has appeared in the ranks of gemstones: fluorite.
    Fluorite was not considered very precious in the past, but it has long been used as an ornament because of its beautiful color, often in pale yellow, green, blue, purple, and brown and red, and it has a glass-like luster, somewhat like crystal. When it is pure in composition and does not contain impurities, it is even more similar to crystal. However, crystal is a compound of silicon and oxygen, while fluorite is a compound of calcium and fluorine, and their properties are not the same. Just by observing carefully, one can find differences. In terms of appearance, crystal is hexagonal prismatic and often has one end tapered into a cone, while fluorite is in the form of cubic blocks. In addition, their hardness is also different; fluorite is softer and can be scratched by glass, while crystal can scratch glass. Therefore, in this respect, it seems that fluorite is not as precious as crystal, but in industry, the uses of fluorite are far beyond what crystal can match. After the end of the 19th century, people discovered that adding it during steelmaking can enhance the fluidity of the slag and remove harmful substances such as sulfur and phosphorus, especially in alkaline open-hearth steelmaking. Approximately two to four kilograms are consumed per ton of steel, so fluorite was mined in large quantities.
    Later, with the development of the aluminum refining industry, fluorite became even more valuable, because when using the electrolytic method to produce aluminum, cryolite must be added to promote the electrolysis of alumina. Cryolite is a compound of aluminum, sodium, and fluorine, and naturally produced cryolite is rare, so fluorite is used to manufacture it.
    However, fluorite's great display of its abilities is still in the present.
    Fluorite contains a large amount of fluorine. Fluorine is an element with particularly strong chemical activity; there is no metal that cannot combine with it, and even glass can be corroded by it. This property has been used to create patterns on glassware. From this, it can be seen that fluorine is much more active than oxygen; oxygen can rust iron, but it cannot corrode glass. Scientists have imagined that if fluorine were used instead of oxygen as an oxidant, burning would produce extremely high temperatures, which are theoretically calculated to reach more than 4,000 degrees Celsius, so fluorine has become an ideal oxidant in rocket propellants.
    Obtaining fluorine is a very dangerous task because it is highly toxic and extremely corrosive. However, "using the enemy's spear against his shield" is very suitable for fluorine. Many fluorine compounds are very stable and are not afraid of corrosion. For example, a plastic called "polytetrafluoroethylene" can resist fluorine corrosion, and naturally, it does not care about the effects of oxygen, chlorine, acids, and alkalis; it is also very strong and heat-resistant, so it is called the "king of plastics." Another example is that sulfur and fluorine compounds are the most stable gases, which can withstand high voltages of 5.6 million volts and are the best gaseous insulation materials.
    After the rise of the atomic energy industry, fluorine has taken on new tasks. In naturally produced uranium, only uranium with an atomic weight of 235 is suitable as "fuel" for atomic reactors or atomic bombs, but this type of uranium is not abundant in natural uranium, and it must be refined to gather it in large quantities. We use the characteristics that uranium 235 and fluorine compounds, as well as other uranium and fluorine compounds, are volatile, and we use fractional distillation to separate them, so we can obtain highly pure uranium 235. Among uranium compounds, only compounds with fluorine are volatile, so fluorine is particularly important.
    It seems that the prospects for the use of fluorine are still very broad, and this is just the beginning. The content of fluorine in the earth's crust is not very small, accounting for 0.08%, which is twice the content of nitrogen. However, it is very dispersed, so its content in ordinary rocks and soils is extremely small. At present, only fluorite and apatite can be used to extract fluorine. Apatite does not contain much fluorine either, so the main source still relies on fluorite. Therefore, fluorite has suddenly transformed from a historical ornament into a cutting-edge mineral and a true gem. This is because human labor has given it precious value.

    萤石——真正的宝石
    柳风
    近年来，在宝石的行列里，出现了一种真正有价值的“宝”石，这就是萤石。
    萤石在过去并不被认为是很珍贵的东西，但长期以来人们便把它用来作装饰品，因为它色泽美丽，常呈较淡的黄、绿、蓝、紫以及褐、红等色，并有玻璃一样的光泽，有些像水晶。当它成分纯粹不含杂质时，更和水晶相似了。但是，水晶是矽和氧的化合物，萤石是钙和氟的化合物，它们的性质不是一样的。只要注意观察，就可发现。在外形上，水晶是六方柱状，而且常有一端收拢成为锥形，萤石则是正方块状。此外，它们的硬度也不同，萤石较软，可以被玻璃划破，而水晶则能划破玻璃。因此，就这一点来比，好像萤石不如水晶珍贵，但是在工业上，萤石的用途就远非水晶能比。十九世纪末叶以后，人们发现在炼钢时掺和了它，可以增强炉渣的流动性，并能去掉硫、磷等有害物质，特别是在碱性平炉炼钢中要用它。炼一吨钢大约要消耗二至四公斤，于是萤石被大量开采起来了。
    后来炼铝工业发达起来了，萤石的身价更高了，因为在用电解法制铝时，需要加入一种冰晶石才能促使氧化铝电解。冰晶石是铝、钠和氟的化合物，天然产出的很少，要用萤石来制造。
    但是萤石的大显神通还在今朝。
    萤石中含有大量的氟。氟是一种化学活动性特别强的元素，没有一种金属不能和它化合，连玻璃也能被它腐蚀。它的这个性质曾经被利用来制造玻璃器皿上的花纹。从这里可以看出，氟要比氧的活动能力强得多，氧能使铁生锈，但不能使玻璃腐蚀，科学家们设想，如果用氟来代替氧作为氧化剂，燃烧时将得到极高的温度，从理论上算出可以达到四千多度以上，因此氟成为火箭推进药中很理想的氧化剂。
    要制取氟，是一件很危险的事情，因为它有剧毒和极高的腐蚀性。不过“以子之矛、攻子之盾”，对于氟来说倒很合适。不少氟的化合物都很稳定，不怕腐蚀。譬如有一种叫“聚四氟乙烯”的塑料，便可以抵抗住氟的腐蚀，自然对氧、氯、酸、碱之类的作用更是不在意；它还很坚固耐热，因此被称为“塑料大王”。又如硫和氟的化合物是最稳定的气体，能耐五百六十万伏特的高电压，是最好的气体绝缘材料。
    在原子能工业兴起后，氟又有了新的任务。在天然产出的铀中，只有一种原子量为235的铀才适合作原子反应堆或是原子弹的“燃料”，但是这种铀在天然铀中含量不多，要经过提炼才能将它大量聚集起来。我们利用了铀235和氟的化合物以及其他铀和氟的化合物都有挥发性的特点，利用分馏的方法将它分开，便能得到纯度很高的铀235。在铀的化合物中，只有和氟的化合物才有挥发性，因此氟就特别重要了。
    看来，氟的利用前途还很广阔，这不过只是开始，氟在地壳中的含量并不算很少，占到0.08％，比氮的含量要多一倍。但是它很分散，因而在普通的岩石土块中含量极微。目前还只有萤石以及磷灰石可以用来提取氟。磷灰石中含氟也不多，主要来源还靠萤石，因此萤石一下从历史上的装饰品变成了尖端矿物和真正的宝石，这是人的劳动赋予了它珍贵的价值。
