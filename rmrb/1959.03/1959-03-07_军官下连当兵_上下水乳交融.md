Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The practice of officers of all services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army going down to the companies to serve as soldiers has achieved tremendous results. To date, over 100,000 officers throughout the army have served as soldiers. Through officers serving as soldiers, a moving scene of equality, mutual love, and joint progress between officers and soldiers has emerged throughout the army, bringing extremely far-reaching impacts on the ideological and work double leaps of all personnel and the army's construction.

Officers going down to the companies to serve as soldiers is a revolutionary measure of great significance. According to the General Political Department's regulations, each officer serves as a soldier for one month each year. This measure quickly gained the enthusiastic support of the vast number of officers throughout the army. Generals Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, Xu Shiyou, Deng Hua, Chen Zaidao, Lieutenant General Wen Niansheng, Lieutenant General Qin Jiwei, Air Force Lieutenant General Cheng Jun, Navy Lieutenant General Tao Yong, and others took the lead in going down to the companies to serve as soldiers. Subsequently, thousands upon thousands of officers throughout the army, whether old cadres, new cadres, senior officers, or general officers, went to the companies to serve as soldiers. A large number of cadres who originally worked in the companies also took turns working as ordinary soldiers. To date, in some units, more than 80% of the officers have served as soldiers in the companies.

Officers going down to the companies to serve as soldiers, especially those generals with remarkable military exploits and graying hair, completely living the life of ordinary soldiers, effectively impacted the ideological consciousness left over from the old society, cultivated people's communist thought, and made the entire army overflow with a moving scene of unity, close relationships, and equal treatment. When officers serving as soldiers went to the companies, they shared the same pot of rice and the same bowl of vegetables with the soldiers. They slept bed to bed, walked hand in hand, rushed to carry guns during marches, and competed to set up bunks during camping. For the sick, they brought tea to their hands and medicine to their mouths, showing meticulous care. During rest periods, many generals who had commanded troops for decades told stories, discussed the situation, talked about their families, and shared their experiences with the young soldiers, singing songs together. This warmth of the revolutionary big family made people clearly feel that there was only a division of labor between generals and soldiers, and no distinction between noble and base. General Yang Chengwu asked the squad leader for leave, raising his hand in salute. Private Huang Lizi said with emotion, "General, your salute is like a歼灭 war, wiping out the hierarchical concepts in people's minds."

Officers going down to the companies to serve as soldiers directly promoted an all-round great leap forward in the work of the troops. Companies where officers served as soldiers achieved remarkable results in training, construction, production labor, and other aspects. Encouraged by the cadres serving as soldiers, the Sixth Company of a certain unit learned swimming at sea and blasting techniques in ten days, and all four weapons scored excellent results in mountain shooting. During a long march of more than 500 miles by a certain unit, no one fell behind. Some soldiers with blisters on their feet also persisted to the end. They said: General Zhang Caiqian, who is serving as a soldier in the company, has a longer combat history than my age, and he is running ahead, how can we young men fall behind? The logistics minister of a certain unit, with the rank of lieutenant general, served as a cook, rushing to cook and stir-fry dishes, moving a cook who thought it was not honorable to be a cook and had not written to his wife for three months. He said: "Now I realize the importance of cooking work."

At the same time, officers going down to the companies to serve as soldiers allowed the leaders' thoughts to connect with the soldiers, and their work to take root in the companies, greatly improving the leadership style. Many cadres summarized the gains of serving as soldiers as: receiving new communist ideas and losing the bad work styles of "three winds and five airs." Now, when considering problems and arranging work, they not only start from the leadership's perspective but also consider from the company's perspective and from the perspective of the vast number of soldiers. This is of extremely far-reaching significance for timely solving problems in actual work and accelerating the construction of a modern revolutionary army.

    军官下连当兵
    上下水乳交融
    据新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军各军种、各兵种部队军官下连当兵取得了巨大的成效。到目前止，全军下连当兵军官已达十多万人。通过军官当兵，军队中到处出现了官兵平等互爱、共同奋发前进的动人景象，为全军人员思想、工作双跃进和军队建设事业带来了极其深远的影响。
    军官下连当兵是一个具有重大意义的革命措施。根据总政治部的规定，每个军官每年当兵一个月，这一措施迅速获得全军广大军官的热烈拥护。杨得志上将、杨成武上将、许世友上将、邓华上将、陈再道上将、文年生中将、秦基伟中将、成钧空军中将、陶勇海军中将等，首先带头下连当兵。接着，全军成千上万的军官，无论是老干部、新干部、高级军官、一般军官，都相继到连队当兵。大批原在连队工作的干部，也轮流下班当兵。到目前止，有的部队80％以上的军官已在连队当过兵。
    军官下连当兵，特别是那些战功卓著、须发斑白的将军下连当兵，完全过士兵生活，有效地冲击了旧社会遗留下来的思想意识，培育了人们的共产主义思想，使全军上下洋溢着一片团结一心、水乳交融、平等相处的动人景象。当兵军官下到连队，与士兵同吃一个锅的饭，一个盆的菜。睡觉床靠床，散步手牵手，行军抢着背枪，宿营争着搭铺。对于病员更是茶端到手，药送到口，问寒问暖，无微不至。休息的时间，许多领兵数十年的将军和小伙子们一起讲故事、论形势、叙家常、道身世，一起唱歌。这种革命大家庭的温暖，使人们清楚地感到将军和士兵，只有职务分工的不同，没有贵贱之分。杨成武上将向班长请假举手敬礼，列兵黄力子看到感动地说：“将军啊，你一举手敬礼就打了个歼灭战，歼灭了人们思想上的等级观念。”
    军官下连当兵直接推动了部队工作全面大跃进。凡是有军官当兵的连队，在训练、施工、生产劳动等各方面都获得了显著成绩。某部六连在当兵干部鼓舞下，十天全部学会了海上游泳，爆破技术，并且在山地射击中，四种武器全部打了优秀。某部长途行军五百多里无一掉队。有的脚上打了泡的战士也坚持到底。他们说：下连当兵的张才千将军，战斗历史比我年龄都长，他跑在头里，小伙子哪能掉队？某部中将后勤部长当炊事兵，抢着做饭炒菜，感动得一个认为当炊事兵不光荣、三个月不写信告诉爱人的炊事兵也转变了。他说：“现在我认识到炊事工作的重要了。”
    同时军官下连当兵，使领导的思想和战士通气，工作在连队生根，大大改进了领导作风。许多干部总结当兵的收获是：收到了共产主义新思想，失掉了三风五气坏作风。现在，在考虑问题、布置工作时，都不仅只是从领导角度出发，也从连队角度考虑，从广大士兵出发了。这对于及时解决实际工作中的问题，加速现代化革命军队的建设，是有极其深远的意义的。
