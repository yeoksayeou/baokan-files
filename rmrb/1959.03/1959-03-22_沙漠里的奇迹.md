Miracle in the Desert
Fish Lake
Now, farmers in the desert area of northern Shaanxi can eat locally produced fresh fish. These fish are produced in the "haizi" (small lakes) in the desert along the Great Wall. According to a survey: more than ninety haizi of various sizes suitable for fish farming have been discovered in Shenmu, Yulin, Jingbian, Dingbian and other counties, covering an area of more than 100,000 mu, of which two-thirds of the haizi contain abundant natural fish.

Last August, the Yulin Prefectural Commissioner's Office established the first Shahaizi Fish Farm at Hongjiandao Haizi in Shenmu County. In the past four or five months, the fish farm has caught more than 100,000 jin of fish. In addition to supplying local people for consumption, it also supplied the markets in Inner Mongolia and Yulin.

With the arrival of spring, the Shahaizi is still covered with thick ice. Every dusk, when snowflakes fall and the weather is freezing, the workers at the fish farm begin ice fishing. They open many ice holes on the frozen lake, erect red lanterns one by one, and then put down their nets to catch fish. The fishermen drive ice sleds, running back and forth, checking the fishing nets. At night, the lake is dotted with lights and figures, which is very beautiful.

Underground Reservoir
Anyone who has been to the desert will know how precious water is! The arid desert lacks water the most. But who would have thought that endless underground reservoirs could be dug out of the arid desert?

The first to uncover this secret were the farmers of Jinjiwan in Dingbian County, Yulin Prefecture. They dug out springs in the desert while building canals, and the water flow was very strong. Two waterwheels were installed at the heads of the newly built canals, turning day and night, with a constant flow of water.

The Dingbian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promoted the experience of the farmers in Jinjiwan. Dingbian County only has one eight-li-long river, but now the county has excavated sixty-two artificial rivers, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of land.

Wild Cherry
Every spring, a peculiar sight appears on the vast desert around Mengjiawan north of Yulin City: a bright red color rises on the vast yellow sand, like a burning flame.

It turns out that there is a wild cherry forest here. Its area reaches about ten thousand mu, and each cherry tree is generally about one and a half meters high. This wild cherry tree has a very strong adaptability. It is not afraid of wind, sand and high cold, and stands towering in the desert all year round. Its fruit can be used as medicine and can also be used to extract oil.

Now, people are not only expanding the planting of this tree species to fix the desert, but also preparing to graft improved cherry varieties, so that Shaanxi Province, which does not produce cherries at all, can eat cherries produced in the province.

    沙漠里的奇迹
    鱼湖
    现在，陕北大沙漠区的农民们，能够吃到当地生产的鲜鱼了。这些鱼出产在长城沿线沙漠中的海子里。据调查：神木、榆林、靖边、定边等县共发现适于养鱼的大小海子九十多个，面积约有十万多亩，其中三分之二的海子蕴藏着丰富的天然鱼类。
    去年8月，榆林专署在神木县红碱道海子建立起了第一个沙海子养鱼场。四、五个月以来，这个鱼场共捕鱼十万多斤，除供当地人民吃用外，还供应了内蒙古和榆林等地的市场需要。
    春季来临，沙海子还结着厚冰。每当黄昏，雪花飘落，天寒地冻时，鱼场的工人们就开始了冰下捕鱼。他们在冰封的湖面上打开许多冰窟隆，并架起一个一个的红灯笼，然后下网捕鱼。捕鱼工人驾着冰橇，来往奔驰，验看鱼网。入夜，湖面上灯火点点，人影绰绰，十分美丽。
    地下水库
    到过沙漠的人就会知道水是多么珍贵呵！干旱的沙漠最缺乏的是水。但是又有谁想到过干旱的大沙漠里还能挖出源源不绝的地下水库呢？
    最早揭开这个秘密的是榆林专区定边县金鸡湾的农民。他们修水渠时在沙漠里挖出了泉水，水势很旺；新修的两个水渠的渠头安装了两部水车，昼夜车水，水流不断。
    中共定边县委推广了金鸡湾农民的经验。定边全县只有一道八里长的河，但是，现在全县已经开挖了六十二道人造河，能灌溉十万亩土地。
    野生樱桃
    每当春天，在榆林城北孟家湾一带的大沙漠上，就会出现一种奇特的景色：广阔的黄沙上泛起一片鲜红的颜色，如燃烧的火焰一般。
    原来这儿有一片野生的樱桃林。它的面积达万亩左右，每个樱桃树一般高一公尺半上下。这种野生的樱桃树的适应性很强，它不惧风沙和高寒，终年巍然挺立在沙漠之中。它的果实可以做药材，还能榨油。
    现在，人们不仅正在扩大种植这种树种，用来固定沙漠，并且准备接种良种樱桃，使得根本不出产樱桃的陕西省，可以吃到本省出产的樱桃。
