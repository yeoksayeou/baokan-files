Bi-Weekly International Review
(February 15th—28th)

    Macmillan's Visit to the Soviet Union

    British Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, which began on February 21st, has attracted great attention from people around the world. As can be seen from British newspaper reports, all levels of British residents, all political parties, and all groups support Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union and expect the visit to achieve positive results. This sentiment of the British public is entirely understandable. As everyone knows, due to successive British governments' post-war policies of closely following the United States in creating international tensions and implementing arms expansion and war preparations, and due to the growing and insurmountable contradictions within the imperialist bloc, Britain is now in a very unfavorable position. Seeking ways to ease international tensions and find a way out of economic difficulties has become the issue of greatest concern to the British public. Macmillan is visiting the Soviet Union at this time, expressing hope that personal contact will help solve international problems and that beneficial talks can be held on Anglo-Soviet trade issues. This shows that Macmillan has felt the enormous pressure from the British public. Despite Macmillan possibly having other motives, the British people have every reason to demand that Macmillan bring back results from this visit that are in line with the wishes of the British people, and not in line with the interests of the American ruling clique. "If he cannot speak for America, he can speak for the British government." - This statement from the British "Worker's Daily" typically reflects the wishes of the British public regarding this visit.

    However, some people in the United States, France, and West Germany are very afraid that this visit will produce results that help ease international tensions and raise Britain's international status. American newspapers emphasize that Macmillan's trip is for "exploration" rather than negotiation. For example, the "New York Times" spreads doubt about the possible results of this visit, saying that apart from some nominal results in cultural and trade relations, no results are likely to be achieved on other issues such as the Berlin problem, the German problem, and disarmament. After the Soviet Union proposed concluding a non-aggression treaty with Britain, the United States quickly sent Eisenhower himself to pour cold water on the idea, saying that "separate non-aggression treaties are unnecessary." French bourgeois public opinion also tried its best to promote that Macmillan's visit was just "a reconnaissance trip." The "French Observer" weekly emphasized that "Macmillan has absolutely no possibility of breaking free from 'Anglo-American interdependence,' and he cannot act independently." The West German government expressed even more dissatisfaction with Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. Adenauer believes that this visit is surprising and carries the risk of weakening the "unified Western front." The "Die Welt," which has a large influence in West Germany, directly warned Macmillan not to "endanger the West's negotiating position."

    Macmillan's visit is still in progress. Whether this visit can achieve some positive results largely depends on whether he is willing to prioritize the interests of the British people and the peaceful interests of the people of the world!

                    Despicable Political Bargaining

    On February 19th, Britain, Greece, and Turkey signed the London Agreement on the Cyprus issue. Prior to this, Greece and Turkey first reached an agreement in Zurich, Switzerland, on February 11th, and the London Agreement was formulated on the basis of the Zurich Agreement. The London Agreement stipulates that Cyprus will become an "independent republic," but Britain, Greece, and Turkey can separately or jointly interfere with the basic rights of Cyprus based on a so-called "treaty of guarantee for Cyprus." This agreement allows Britain to continue to occupy its military bases in Cyprus and to have absolute sovereignty over these bases. This agreement also stipulates that Cyprus must conclude a military alliance with Greece and Turkey, and these two countries will station troops in Cyprus. This agreement even arbitrarily predetermines every key point for Cyprus's future constitution.

    It is clear at a glance that the London Agreement is the product of a political deal between Britain, Greece, and Turkey, these three North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries: Britain gives Greece and Turkey the right to jointly rule Cyprus; Greece and Turkey use their respective influence over the Greek and Turkish residents of Cyprus to help Britain quell the angry tide of the Cypriot people's struggle for independence. And the Cypriot people have become the victims of this political deal. Their right to self-determination is completely deprived, and the future "Republic of Cyprus" is independent in name only, and in substance becomes a protectorate of Britain, Greece, and Turkey.

    All indications show that the United States played a decisive role in making this despicable colonialist political deal.

    Western bourgeois newspapers all believe that the United States was the planner of the Greek-Turkish Zurich agreement. The United States International News Agency frankly admitted that "the United States used economic pressure by guaranteeing increased aid or warning of possible cuts in current aid to put pressure on Turkey and Greece to help reach an agreement." After Greece and Turkey reached an agreement, according to Reuters, observers in London believed that Britain could not disagree with the basis of the Greek-Turkish agreement because this agreement was "praised by the State Department in Washington." Archbishop Makarios, who participated in the London talks and was forced to accept the London Agreement, also pointed out: "The United States has put pressure on certain parties involved." Only a few hours after the London Agreement was signed, the U.S. State Department issued a statement expressing its "heartfelt welcome."

    As some Greek newspapers pointed out, the reason why the United States has been so actively promoting and welcoming the current form of the Cyprus agreement is because this agreement "will be linked to the Balkan Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and can make the new Cypriot state "feel the influence of Washington." Newspapers of the American monopoly groups have already begun to talk about "aiding" the future "Republic of Cyprus," and Eisenhower openly praised the London Agreement for "inevitably strengthening and encouraging the alliance of the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization." All this shows that the United States is actively preparing to make Cyprus an aggressive military base controlled by the North Atlantic bloc, and of course controlled by the United States.

    But can a piece of paper like the London Agreement stop the Cypriot people from continuing their struggle for independence? The British "Times" believes that the implementation of the agreement will encounter great difficulties because "a constitution imposed on people has never worked." This is precisely the case: the patriotic Cypriot people have begun to launch a struggle against the London Agreement under the slogan "Long Live Self-Determination." The London Agreement, which completely violates the will of the Cypriot people, will not last long; the imperialists' conspiracy to divide Cyprus is destined to be shattered.

            We Must Be Vigilant Against American Conspiracies

    In the past half month, a series of aggressive and conspiratorial activities by the United States in Indochina have created a new tense situation in the region.

    In Laos, the United States openly instigated and supported the Royal Lao Government in abandoning the Geneva Accords. On February 11th, Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone issued a statement unilaterally declaring that the Kingdom of Laos had completed its responsibilities to fulfill the Geneva Accords and was no longer obligated to abide by the Geneva Accords, and opposed the resumption of activities by the International Commission in Laos which was supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords, claiming that the Kingdom of Laos did not recognize the arbitration of any international organization other than the United Nations. This is clearly a serious act by the Kingdom of Laos to flagrantly violate the Geneva Accords, attempting to completely overturn the part of the Geneva Accords related to Laos. In fact, the Royal Lao Government has not only not "completely fulfilled" its responsibilities under the Geneva Accords, but many provisions of the Geneva Accords have also been constantly and rudely violated by the Royal Lao Government. The political settlement stipulated in the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" has not yet been realized; the issue of not retaliating against or discriminating against former resistance personnel and guaranteeing their democratic freedoms has not yet been resolved. In addition, the final declaration of the Geneva Conference also clearly stipulates that the Lao government shall not accept foreign assistance regarding military materials, personnel, and instructors, shall not participate in military alliances, and shall not provide bases to foreign military forces. The Royal Lao Government also guaranteed in its statement at the Geneva Conference: "Determined never to participate in aggressive policies, and never to allow Lao territory to be used to serve such policies." But the Royal Lao Government has broken its obligations under the Geneva Accords, willingly accepting a series of American military interventions in Laos, seriously hindering and undermining the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

    This action by the Royal Lao Government is inseparable from the conspiracy of American imperialism to deliberately tear up the Geneva Accords and create a tense situation in Indochina. Recently, American military intervention activities in Laos have been more frequent and more blatant than before. The most obvious thing is that just one day after Sananikone issued his statement tearing up the Geneva Accords, on February 12th, the U.S. State Department immediately issued a statement to support it, and openly stated that the United States is now "free" to establish a military mission in Laos.

    Regarding Cambodia, which adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality, the United States' conspiracy of interference has taken a different approach. While the United States is instructing Thailand and South Vietnam to constantly create border disputes, putting external pressure on Cambodia, it is buying over and supporting pro-American elements in Cambodia to carry out division and subversion from within. On February 22nd, after exposing and suppressing the treasonous conspiracy of the Sang Sary group, the Royal Cambodian Government took military action against the treasonous crimes of Cheong Mochupich, the governor of Siem Reap province. According to the materials that were seized, the conspiracy to subvert the current Cambodian government was being carried out under the planning of the United States. The United States supplied the rebels with large amounts of funds and modern weapons, and used Saigon and Bangkok as their bases of operations.

    The current conspiracy of rebellion in Cambodia has been suppressed, but the rebels' armed forces have not yet been completely eliminated, so new unstable situations may still arise. In addition, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek group operating in Burma and Laos are stepping up their collusion with the United States and the Kingdom of Laos, and are ready to make trouble. South Vietnamese officials have also begun to clamor that South Vietnam is not bound by the Geneva Accords. These facts show that American imperialism is intensifying its creation of tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia. All those who care about peace in this region have a responsibility to stop the United States' conspiracies of interference and aggression.

            A Continuing Surge of Torrential Forces

    Recently, the movement of African people to fight for national liberation has been like a torrential flood that has broken its banks, surging and pounding against some of the last strongholds of the colonialists.

    Following closely behind the Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule, the situation in Black Africa has undergone dramatic turmoil. The armed struggle of the Cameroonian people is in full swing. Anti-colonial flames have been ignited in the Central African Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Italian Somaliland, and the Union of South Africa. Anti-colonial demonstrations by the people of Nyasaland are increasing in scale. Demonstrators are constantly clashing with the police, and have once occupied the airport in Hillborough. Unstable situations have also begun to appear in Southern Rhodesia, with the outbreak of a large-scale strike by six thousand African workers against colonial exploitation. The struggle of the people of Rhodesia-Nyasaland will inevitably have a significant impact on neighboring Uganda, Tanganyika, Mozambique, and Southwest Africa. The flames of African people fighting for national independence are spreading like wildfire from North Africa and West Africa rapidly towards Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa.

    Facing the unstoppable national liberation movement, the Western colonialists are attempting to make a dying struggle, and are currently carrying out frantic persecution and massacres in African colonies. The British colonial authorities have transferred a large number of colonial troops to Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and have even dispatched "vampire"-style military aircraft to carry out bloody suppression of unarmed demonstrators. The French colonial authorities, on the one hand, hypocritically expressed their agreement that the French Cameroons Trust Territory would become independent on January 1, 1960, and on the other hand, carried out large-scale sweeps and arrests of the Cameroonian people who yearn for independence. The Belgian colonialists continue to adopt methods of suppression and terror against the Congolese people.

    But no matter how brutal and frantic the colonialists are, the current situation is becoming increasingly clear that the days when the colonialists will get out of Africa are definitely not far away. As Cameroonian People's Union Vice Chairman Ouandi recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters: "Because of the justice of our cause, and with the support of the Asian-African people and the socialist countries, we are convinced that final victory will definitely belong to us."

    半月国际述评
    （2月15日—28日）
    麦克米伦访苏
    英国首相麦克米伦于2月21日开始访问苏联，这一行动引起了全世界各国人民的极大注意。从英国报纸的报道中可以看出，英国各阶层居民、各政党和各团体都赞成麦克米伦访问苏联，并且期望这次访问能取得积极的成果。英国公众的这一心情，是完全可以理解的。大家知道，由于战后历届英国政府执行了紧紧追随美国的制造国际紧张局势、实行扩军备战的政策，由于帝国主义集团内部日益增长的不可克服的矛盾，英国今天已经处于十分不妙的地位。寻求缓和国际紧张局势的途径，寻求打开经济困难的出路，已经成为英国公众所最关心的问题。麦克米伦正是在这个时候访问苏联，他表示希望通过个人接触而有助于解决国际问题，并且希望能够就英苏贸易问题举行一些有益的会谈。这说明麦克米伦已经感受到英国公众的巨大压力。尽管麦克米伦可能抱有其他动机，英国人民有一切理由要求麦克米伦从这次访问中带回符合于英国人民的愿望，而不是吻合美国统治集团的利益的结果。“如果他不能代表美国说话，他能够代表英国政府说话。”——英国“工人日报”的这番话，典型地反映了英国公众对这次访问所抱的愿望。
    但是，美国、法国和西德的有些人却十分害怕这次访问会产生有助于缓和国际紧张局势的成果，会提高英国的国际地位。美国报纸强调麦克米伦此行目的是进行“试探”而不是谈判，譬如，“纽约时报”就对这次访问可能产生的成果散播怀疑，说什么除了在文化和贸易关系问题上会取得某些有名无实的结果外，其他关于柏林问题、德国问题和裁军等问题都不见得会取得任何结果。在苏联提出愿和英国缔结互不侵犯条约以后，美国连忙由艾森豪威尔亲自出面浇冷水，说“各别的互不侵犯条约是不必要的”。法国资产阶级舆论也极力宣传麦克米伦只是“一次侦察旅行”。“法兰西观察家”周刊就强调“麦克米伦绝对没有可能脱出‘英美相互依存’，他不能独断独行”。西德官方对麦克米伦的访苏更是表示不满。阿登纳认为这次访问是令人惊讶的，有着使“西方统一阵线”削弱的危险。在西德影响很大的“世界报”就直截了当地警告麦克米伦不得“危害西方的谈判地位”。
    麦克米伦的访问尚在进行中。这次访问能否取得一些积极的结果，在很大程度上要看他是否愿以英国人民的利益为重，愿以世界人民的和平利益为重！
                    卑鄙的政治买卖
    2月19日，英国、希腊和土耳其三国就塞浦路斯问题签订了伦敦协定。在此之前，希腊和土耳其于2月11日在瑞士的苏黎世首先达成了协议，伦敦协定就是以苏黎世协议为基础而制订的。伦敦协定规定塞浦路斯成为“独立的共和国”，但是，英、希、土三国却可以根据一项所谓“对塞浦路斯的保证的条约”而分别地或共同地干涉塞浦路斯的基本权利。这一协定使得英国继续占有它在塞浦路斯的军事基地，并拥有对这些基地的绝对主权。这一协定还规定塞浦路斯必须和希、土两国缔结军事联盟，这两国将在塞浦路斯驻兵。这一协定甚至专断地预先为塞浦路斯未来的宪法决定了每一项要点。
    一望而知，伦敦协定是英、希、土这三个北大西洋集团国家之间的一场政治买卖的产物：英国给予希、土两国以共同统治塞浦路斯的权利；希、土两国利用它们各自对塞浦路斯希土血统居民的影响，帮助英国平息塞浦路斯人民争取独立运动的怒潮。而塞浦路斯人民则成为这场政治买卖的牺牲品，他们的自决权利被完全剥夺，未来的“塞浦路斯共和国”空有独立之名，实质上成为英、希、土三国的保护国。
    一切迹象表明，美国在作成这场卑鄙的殖民主义政治买卖中起了决定性的作用。
    西方资产阶级报刊无不认为美国是希—土苏黎世协议的策划者。美国的合众国际社就坦率地承认“美国通过保证增加援助或警告可能削减目前的援助的办法，向土耳其和希腊施加了经济压力，以帮助达成协议”。希、土达成协议后，据路透社报道，伦敦的观察家就认为英国不可能不同意希—土协议的基础，因为这个协议是“受到华盛顿的国务院的称赞”的。参加了伦敦的会谈并被迫接受伦敦协定的马卡里奥斯大主教也指出：“美国对当事的某些方面施加了压力”。伦敦协定签订后仅数小时，美国国务院即发表声明表示“衷心欢迎”。
    正如希腊的一些报纸所指出的，美国所以这样积极促成和欢迎目前形式的塞浦路斯协定，是因为这一协定“将同巴尔干公约和北大西洋公约组织联系起来”，并且可以使新的塞浦路斯国家“感觉到华盛顿的影响”。美国垄断集团的报刊已经开始谈论要“援助”未来的“塞浦路斯共和国”，艾森豪威尔公开称赞伦敦协定“不可能不加强和鼓励整个北大西洋公约组织的联盟”。这一切都说明，美国在积极准备使塞浦路斯成为由北大西洋集团控制的，当然也就是由美国控制的侵略性军事基地。
    但是，难道一纸伦敦协定能使塞浦路斯人民停止他们的争取独立的斗争吗？英国“泰晤士报”就认为协定的执行会遇到很大困难，因为“从来没有一个强加于人的宪法是可以行得通的”。事实也正是这样的：塞浦路斯爱国人民已开始在“自决万岁”的口号下展开反对伦敦协定的斗争。完全违背了塞浦路斯人民的意志的伦敦协定，它的寿命是不会长的；帝国主义者企图瓜分塞浦路斯的阴谋是注定要被粉碎的。
            必须警惕美国的阴谋
    半个多月来，由于美国在印度支那进行的一系列侵略阴谋活动，形成了这个地区的新的紧张形势。
    在老挝，美国公然策动和支持老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议。2月11日，老挝首相培·萨纳尼空发表声明，片面宣布老挝王国已经完成履行日内瓦协议的责任，已再无遵守日内瓦协议的义务，并且反对监督日内瓦协议实施的老挝国际委员会恢复活动，声称老挝王国不承认联合国以外的任何国际组织的仲裁。这显然是老挝王国悍然破坏日内瓦协议，企图将日内瓦协议有关老挝的部分全盘推翻的严重行为。实际上，老挝王国政府对于日内瓦协议的责任不仅远没有“完全履行”，而且日内瓦协议的许多条款还不断遭到老挝王国政府的粗暴破坏。“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”所规定的政治解决还没有实现；对于前抗战人员不加报复和歧视并保障其民主自由的问题还没有得到解决。此外，日内瓦会议最后宣言还明确规定，老挝政府不得接受关于军事物资、人员和教官的外国援助，不得参加军事同盟和向外国军事力量提供基地。老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议的声明中也曾保证：“决心永不参与侵略政策，并永不允许老挝的领土被利用来为此种政策服务。”但老挝王国政府却背弃了它对日内瓦协议所承担的义务，甘心接受美国对老挝的一系列的军事干涉活动，使日内瓦协议在老挝的全部实施严重地遭到阻挠和破坏。
    老挝王国政府的这种行动是同美帝国主义蓄意撕毁日内瓦协议、制造印度支那紧张局势的阴谋分不开的。最近一个时期以来，美国对老挝的军事干涉活动比以前更加频繁，更加露骨。而最为明显的是，就在萨纳尼空发表撕毁日内瓦协议的第二天，2月12日，美国国务院立刻发表声明加以支持，并且公然表示美国现在可以“自由地”在老挝设立军事使团了。
    对于坚持奉行和平中立政策的柬埔寨，美国的干涉阴谋采取了另一种做法。美国在指使泰国和南越不断制造边境纠纷，从外部对柬埔寨施加压力的同时，收买和扶植柬埔寨的亲美分子，从内部进行分化和颠复。2月22日，柬埔寨王国政府继揭露和镇压桑·萨里集团的叛国阴谋之后，又对暹粒省省长琼·莫舒皮的叛国罪行采取了军事行动。据破获的材料证明，颠复柬埔寨现政府的阴谋活动正是在美国的策划下进行的。美国供给叛乱者大量经费和现代化武器，并且以西贡和曼谷作为他们的活动基地。
    目前柬埔寨的叛乱阴谋是被镇压下去了，但叛乱者的武装还没有最后肃清，因而新的不安定的局面仍然可能出现，此外，在缅甸、老挝境内活动的蒋介石集团残余武装，正在同美国和老挝王国方面加紧勾结，蠢蠢欲动。南越官方人士也开始叫嚷南越不受日内瓦协议的约束。这些事实表明，美帝国主义正在印度支那和东南亚加紧制造紧张局势。所有关心这个地区和平的人们，都有责任来制止美国的干涉和侵略的阴谋活动。
            继续汹涌澎湃的洪流
    最近一个时期，非洲人民争取民族解放的运动，有如决了口的洪流，汹涌澎湃地冲击着殖民主义者一些最后的据点。
    紧接着刚果人民反对殖民统治的斗争，黑非洲的形势发生剧烈的动荡。喀麦隆人民的武装斗争正在如火如荼地进行中。在中非罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦、意属索马里兰以及南非联邦等地都燃起了反殖民主义的怒火。尼亚萨兰人民举行的反殖民主义的示威游行，规模日益扩大，示威群众不断同警察发生冲突，并且在希尔堡曾经一度占领了机场。南罗得西亚也已经开始出现不稳的局面，爆发了六千非洲工人为反对殖民剥削的大罢工。罗得西亚—尼亚萨兰人民的斗争不可避免地将对邻近的乌干达、坦噶尼喀、莫三鼻给以及西南非洲地区发生重大的影响。非洲人民争取民族独立的烽火正以燎原之势从北非、西非迅速地向中非、东非和南非蔓延中。
    西方殖民主义者面对着势不可挡的民族解放运动，妄图作垂死的挣扎，目前正在非洲殖民地进行疯狂的迫害和屠杀。英国殖民当局把大批殖民军队调到了罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰，甚至出动了“吸血鬼”式的军用飞机，对手无寸铁的示威群众进行血腥的镇压。法国殖民当局一方面假惺惺地表示同意喀麦隆法国托管区在1960年1月1日独立，另一方面却对向往独立的喀麦隆人民进行大规模的扫荡和逮捕。比利时殖民者继续对刚果人民采取着镇压和恐怖手段。
    但是，任凭殖民主义者如何残暴和疯狂，现实的形势越来越清楚地证明，殖民者滚出非洲去的日子已经肯定的不远了。正如喀麦隆人民联盟副主席乌安迪最近对新华社记者所说的：“由于我们事业的正义性，并且得到非亚人民和社会主义国家的支持，我们确信最后胜利一定属于我们。”
