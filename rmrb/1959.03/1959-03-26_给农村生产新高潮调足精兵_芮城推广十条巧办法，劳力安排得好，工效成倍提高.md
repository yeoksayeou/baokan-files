Mobilizing 85% of Labor Force into the Agricultural Front

(Reported by our newspaper from Taiyuan on March 25th) The Ruicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in rationally planning labor and comprehensively arranging spring plowing production, has seized positive factors and universally summarized and promoted ten advanced experiences created by the masses in saving labor and improving work efficiency. This ensures that 85% of the county's labor force is invested in the agricultural production front this year.

Recently, the Ruicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a comprehensive survey of the county's labor force usage. The results showed that only 71.7% of the county's total labor force was invested in the agricultural front, and only 58% of the total labor force could be directly invested in field production. According to calculations, there was an annual shortage of more than 22,522,000 labor days. In order to solve this problem, the Ruicheng County Committee carefully summarized many effective experiences from various places in saving labor and improving work efficiency, and decided to promote them universally throughout the county.

The eight experiences that are being actively promoted in rationally arranging the labor force to ensure that 85% of the labor force is invested in the agricultural production front are: First, promote the experience of the women's canteen in the Fifth Production Team of the Caixia Management Area of the Satellite Commune. This canteen has only three female cooks, one of whom is a semi-laborer. Although they each have to cook for an average of 46 people, they have adopted the method of doing heavy work collectively, dividing light work, preparing breakfast the night before, and starting dinner in the morning. This allows the commune members to eat on time and the cooks to avoid being rushed. The commune has a total of 5,729 cooks. Originally, each person cooked for an average of 28 people. After promoting their experience, it can not only replace men with women, but also save 2,196 laborers.

Second, promote the experience of "one person, one machine" in the sewing group of the Hanjiaguan Management Area of the Five-Star Commune. After changing from three people with two sewing machines to one person with one machine, the sewing group implemented a piece-rate payment system. The sewing workers actively studied and improved their skills, and still averaged 33 pieces of clothing per day. The county has a total of 430 sewing machines, with 689 sewing workers. After promoting their experience, 259 laborers can be saved.

Third, promote the experience of the frugal kindergarten in Huayue Village of the Yellow River Commune. The two female teachers in this kindergarten each educate an average of 33 children. Because they are diligent in their hands and feet, make their own toys, and beautify the kindergarten, the kindergarten is well-run, freeing up 52 women to participate in field labor. The county has a total of 1,195 kindergarten teachers, who originally only educated an average of 10 children each. After promoting their experience, 828 laborers can be saved.

Fourth, promote the experience of Yao Wensi's "husband and wife trough" in the Seventh Production Team of the Chengguan Management Area of the Yellow River Commune. Yao Wensi and his wife are responsible for raising 16 livestock, and one of them often participates in field production. The county has a total of 5,049 feeders, who originally raised an average of 7.8 livestock each. After promoting this experience, calculating that each person raises an average of 14 livestock, 2,223 laborers can be saved.

Fifth, promote the experience of combining production and learning for amateur agricultural middle school students in the Beiqu Management Area of the Rocket Commune. The 99 students in this school have persisted in learning in the early mornings and evenings in winter and spring, learning in their spare time in summer and autumn, learning more on rainy days, learning less on sunny days, and not learning when they are very busy, thus achieving a combination of production and learning. After promoting this experience, all 2,792 students in the county's amateur agricultural middle schools can participate in agricultural production. In addition, all 290 members of the county's cultural troupe have changed from professional to amateur. The above two items can increase the labor force by 3,085 people.

Sixth, promote the experience of combining agricultural and sideline production in the sideline occupation group of the Huayue Management Area of the Yellow River Commune. The ten laborers in this sideline occupation group, due to scientific arrangements for work and rational use of time, have not only driven carts to transport more than 98,000 catties of coal from December last year to now, supplying the coal needs of 521 households and five boiler camel machines in the entire management area, but also participated in field production, with each person averaging 92 labor days. The county has 2,222 laborers hauling coal, and 1,984 laborers ginning cotton and pressing oil. After promoting this experience, a total of 2,099 laborers can be saved.

Seventh, promote the experience of the Ximo Machinery Factory of the Red Flag Commune in reducing personnel and increasing production. After the number of workers in this machinery factory was reduced from 120 to 94, the output value increased by 37.5% compared to the original, due to the implementation of the "two participations" (cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management), "one establishment" (establishing a production responsibility system), "three combinations" (combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians), and a system of monthly inspections, evaluations, and rewards. Promoting their experience, according to the principles of adapting to local conditions, rational layout, easy management, saving labor, and improving efficiency, after rectifying the county and commune industries, a total of 1,049 laborers can be saved.

Eighth, promote the experience of cadres participating in production in the Shangyang Management Area of the Dongfeng Commune. In the process of rectifying the commune, the number of cadres in this management area has been reduced from 26 to 19. They have implemented a system in which the accountant works in the morning and afternoon and works in the office in the morning and evening, and other personnel are assigned to specific areas and eat, live, and work with the commune members, thus achieving good work and good labor. From November 15th last year to now, each person has averaged 17 labor days per month. After promoting their experience, the county has a total of 937 cadres above the management area level (excluding full-time cadres), and the number has been reduced by 221. The remaining 716 people participate in labor for at least half a year each, which can save a total of 579 laborers. After promoting the above eight advanced experiences, the county will have 51,470 laborers invested in the agricultural production front, accounting for 85% of the total labor force.

The two experiences that are being promoted in improving work efficiency and ensuring that one person does the work of two people are: First, promote the experience of the Jiaolu Management Area of the Dongfeng Commune in improving labor management. While promoting the "basic labor day remuneration system," this management area rationally arranged the labor force, established a production responsibility system, and implemented "five determinations" (determine leadership, determine labor, determine tasks, determine quality, determine time) and "five to the fields" (crops to the fields, indicators to the fields, investment to the fields, measures to the fields, management to the fields), which increased production efficiency by 35%. Second, promote the experience of eight production teams in the Huayue Management Area of the Yellow River Commune in reforming tools. The 360 laborers in these eight production teams actually invested in field production last year. Originally, each person planned to do 249 labor days, but due to the modification and creation of 866 tools, each person actually completed an average of 493 labor days of work, and labor efficiency increased by more than one time. By promoting their experience, the county will modify and create 300,000 various tools this year, which, together with the 122,400 modified and created last year, can save a total of 20,276,016 labor days.

After promoting the above two advanced experiences, the labor force invested in field production in the county will be able to complete 32,548,416 labor days of work throughout the year, and labor efficiency will increase by 1.6 times, exceeding the total number of labor days required by 4%. The problem of insufficient labor in the main agricultural attack front will be fundamentally solved.

In order to make the above ten advanced experiences blossom and bear fruit throughout the county, the county party committee has adopted various forms such as tabloids, wired broadcasting, and on-site conferences to widely and deeply carry out propaganda, mobilizing the vast masses of the county to learn from others' experiences, debate and promote them at the same time, so as to make them richer and more perfect. In promoting the ten advanced experiences, the ideological education work of the personnel transferred to the agricultural production front has been strengthened, so that they can deeply understand the significance and purpose of strengthening the agricultural front, and achieve satisfaction from themselves, their families, and their original units. The county and commune have established labor allocation committees, and the management area has established labor allocation groups, which are specifically responsible for this work.

    给农村生产新高潮调足精兵
    芮城推广十条巧办法，劳力安排得好，工效成倍提高
    集中85％劳力  投入农业战线
    本报太原25日电　中共山西省芮城县委在合理规划劳力、全面安排春耕生产中，大抓积极因素，普遍总结推广了群众创造的节省劳力、提高工效的十项先进经验，从而保证今年全县有85％的劳力投入农业生产战线。
    最近，中共芮城县委对全县劳动力的使用情况进行全面考察的结果表明，全县投入农业战线的劳力仅占劳力总数的71.7％，其中能直接投入田间生产的仅占劳力总数的58％。根据计算，全年尚缺劳动日二千二百五十二万二千多个。为了解决这个问题，芮城县委认真总结了各地在节省劳力、提高工效方面的许多有效的经验，并且决定在全县范围内普遍推广。
    在合理安排劳动力保证85％的劳力投入农业生产战线方面积极推广的八项经验是：第一，推广卫星公社彩霞管理区第五生产队妇女办食堂的经验。这个食堂只有三个女炊事员，其中有一个还是半劳力。虽然她们每人平均要做四十六人的饭，但由于采取了重活集体干，轻活分工担，早饭头天晚上做准备，晚饭当日上午就动手的办法，因而做到了社员按时吃，自己不忙乱。全社共有炊事员五千七百二十九人，原来每人平均做二十八人的饭，推广了她们的经验后，不仅能以女换男，并可节省劳力二千一百九十六人。
    第二，推广五星公社韩家管理区缝纫组一人一机的经验。这个缝纫组，由原来三人两机改为一人一机后，由于推行了按件计酬制，缝纫员积极钻研提高技术，因而每天仍然平均做三十三件衣服。全县共有四百三十部缝纫机，原有缝纫员六百八十九人，推广他们的经验后，可节省劳力二百五十九人。
    第三，推广黄河公社华岳村勤俭办幼儿园的经验。这个幼儿园的两个女教师，每人平均教育三十三个幼儿。由于她们手勤、腿勤，自己制造玩具，自己美化园地，幼儿园办的很好，腾出五十二个妇女参加了田间劳动。全县共有幼儿教师一千一百九十五人，原来每人平均只教育十个幼儿，推广了她们的经验后，可节省劳力八百二十八人。
    第四，推广黄河公社城关管理区第七生产队姚文四“夫妇槽”的经验。姚文四夫妇负责饲养十六头牲口，经常有一人参加田间生产。全县共有饲养员五千零四十九人，原来每人平均饲养牲口七点八头，推广了这一经验后，每人平均以饲养十四头牲口计，可节省劳力二千二百二十三人。
    第五，推广火箭公社北曲管理区业余农业中学生产、学习两结合的经验。这个学校的九十九个学生，由于坚持了冬春早晚学，夏秋抽空学，雨天多学，晴天少学，大忙不学，做到了生产、学习两不误。推广了这项经验后，全县业余农业中学的二千七百九十二个学生可全部参加农业生产。此外，全县的文工团二百九十人全部由专业改为业余。以上两项，可增加劳力三千零八十五人。
    第六，推广黄河公社华岳管理区副业组农副业结合的经验。这个副业组的十个劳力，由于科学安排工活，合理利用时间，从去年12月到现在，不仅赶车拉煤九万八千多斤，供应了全管理区五百二十一户与五个锅驼机的用煤需要，而且参加了田间生产，每人平均做了劳动日九十二个。全县拉煤劳力二千二百二十二人，轧花、榨油的劳力一千九百八十四人，推广这项经验后，共可节省劳力二千零九十九人。
    第七，推广红旗公社西陌机械厂减人增产的经验。这个机械厂的工人，由原来一百二十人减少为九十四人后，由于实行了两参（干部参加劳动、工人参加管理）、一建（建立生产责任制）、三结合（领导干部、工人和技术人员结合）和按月检查、评比、奖励的制度，产值较原来提高了37.5％。推广他们的经验，根据因地制宜、合理布局、便于管理、节省劳力、提高效率的原则，将县、社工业整顿之后，共可节省劳力一千零四十九人。
    第八，推广东风公社上阳管理区干部参加生产的经验。这个管理区在整社中，干部已由二十六人减少为十九人，实行了会计早上、下午劳动，上午晚上办公，其他人员分片包干，和社员同吃同住同劳动等制度，做到了工作好、劳动好。从去年11月15日到现在，每人每月平均做劳动日十七个。推广他们的经验后，全县管理区以上干部（不包括脱产干部）共九百三十七人，已减少二百二十一人。其余七百一十六人，每人全年至少有半年时间参加劳动，这样共可节省劳力五百七十九人。推广上述八项先进经验后，全县投入农业生产战线的劳力将达五万一千四百七十人，占劳力总数的85％。
    在提高工效、保证一人干两人的活方面推广的两项经验是：第一，推广东风公社焦炉管理区改善劳动管理的经验。这个管理区在推行“劳动日基本报酬制”的同时，合理安排了劳力，建立了生产责任制，实行了五定（定领导、定劳力、定任务、定质量、定时间），五到田（作物到田、指标到田、投资到田、措施到田、管理到田），生产效率提高了35％。第二，推广黄河公社华岳管理区八个生产队改革工具的经验。这八个生产队去年实际投入田间生产的有三百六十个劳力，原来每人计划做劳动日二百四十九个，但由于改制和创制了八百六十六件工具，实际每人平均完成了四百九十三个劳动日的工活，劳动效率提高了一倍多。推广他们的经验，今年全县将改制和创制各种工具三十万件，连同去年改制和创制的十二万二千四百余件，共可节省劳动日二千零二十七万六千零一十六个。
    推广上述两项先进经验后，全县投入田间生产的劳动力，全年将可完成三千二百五十四万八千四百一十六个劳动日的工活，劳动效率将提高一点六倍，超过所需劳动日总数的4％。农业主攻战线劳力不足问题将从根本上得到解决。
    为了使上述十项先进经验，在全县范围内遍地开花结果，县委采取了通过小报、有线广播和现场会议等形式，广泛深入地展开了宣传，发动全县广大群众边学习别人的经验，边辩论、边推广，使其更加丰富更加完善。在推广十项先进经验中，加强了对调往农业生产战线的人员的思想教育工作，使他们深刻的理解加强农业战线的意义和目的，做到本人满意、家庭满意和原单位满意。县和公社建立了劳力调配委员会，管理区建立了劳力调配小组，专门负责此项工作。
