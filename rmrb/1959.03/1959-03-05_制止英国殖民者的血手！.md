Stop the Bloody Hands of the British Colonialists!
Commentator of this newspaper

The British colonialists are carrying out a frenzied massacre and suppression of the heroic people of Nyasaland who are striving for independence and freedom. All people with sympathy for oppressed nations and a sense of justice throughout the world should take urgent action to stop the heinous bloody hands of British imperialism!

Disregarding the just calls of the people of Nyasaland for complete independence and secession from the "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland," the British colonialists suddenly declared a "state of emergency" throughout Nyasaland, banned the activities of the Nyasaland African National Congress, arrested the leader of this patriotic organization, Banda, and more than 100 others, and massacred a large number of unarmed patriotic people of Nyasaland. This is another blood debt owed to the people of Nyasaland and the people of Africa. This shocking and barbaric atrocity by the British colonialists has aroused even more violent resistance from the people throughout Nyasaland. Powerful mass demonstrations have broken out in Zomba, the capital of Nyasaland, as well as in Blantyre, Karonga, Nkhata Bay on Lake Nyasa, and other places. Many women and children also participated in the ranks of the struggle. Despite the shooting and suppression by the British colonial army, the demonstrating people used sticks and stones to break open a prison in Nkhata Bay and release all the political prisoners there. The British colonialists thought that by means of bloody massacres, they could suffocate the flames of the Nyasaland people's struggle for independence. Facts have proved that this is nothing but wishful thinking. Banda, the chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, recently said: "Their arrest of me will not work. Nyasaland has now awakened. Whether I am dead or alive or imprisoned, Nyasaland is always awakened." This fully expresses the determination of the people of Nyasaland to win the struggle for national independence. Such a heroic nation full of confidence in victory can never be conquered by any brutal massacre by the British colonialists.

The British colonialists' frenzied massacre and suppression of the people of Nyasaland this time was the most despicable premeditation after careful planning. Since the people of Nyasaland launched a large-scale struggle last month, the British colonialists immediately took measures of armed suppression, but they were met with more fierce resistance from the people of Nyasaland and aroused the indignation of just public opinion in Africa and other countries around the world. Then, on the one hand, the British colonialists spread lies that the situation in Nyasaland had eased and that no state of emergency would be declared there, in order to paralyze the people of Nyasaland and deceive world opinion; on the other hand, they transferred a large number of British colonial troops from colonies such as Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika to the interior of Nyasaland, occupied all the important areas of the country, and prepared to suppress the people of Nyasaland. The British colonialists chose to carry out this bloody massacre and suppression of the people of Nyasaland when the Nyasaland African National Congress was holding a meeting. A Reuters report from Blantyre on March 1 also stated that all parts of Nyasaland were "completely quiet and uneventful"; but on the same day, the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd rushed back to London from Aden and immediately issued an order to suppress the people of Nyasaland. At a special meeting of the British House of Commons on the Nyasaland issue on the 3rd, Lennox-Boyd insisted that the reason why Britain took suppressive measures against the Nyasaland African National Congress was because "this organization was preparing to assassinate European, Asian, and moderate African leaders," which was merely a vain attempt to shirk their responsibility for this planned and barbaric massacre.

The Nyasaland African National Congress is a major political party in Nyasaland. Since the British colonialists imposed the so-called "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland" on the people of Nyasaland in 1953, it has been fighting against the British colonialists together with the people of Nyasaland. The political views of the Nyasaland African National Congress are actually moderate. It only demanded the dissolution of the federation, the establishment of an autonomous government in Nyasaland, and then a phased transition to full independence, while still remaining within the British Commonwealth. However, even such moderate political views were not accepted by the British colonialists, who insisted on completely trampling the people of Nyasaland under their feet, so that the people of Nyasaland would never be able to stand up again. When the people of Nyasaland united to wage a resolute struggle, the British colonialists revealed their bloodthirsty nature and launched a brutal bloody massacre against the people of Nyasaland.

However, the British colonialists' brutal suppression of the people of Nyasaland does not mean that they are powerful. It is precisely a manifestation of their very unfavorable colonial rule in Africa. Since the people of the Congo launched a struggle for national independence in January this year, the national independence movements in Central Africa, East Africa, and Southern Africa have developed greatly. These places are mainly under the rule of the British colonialists. In addition to Nyasaland, the people of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, the Union of South Africa, and other places under British rule have launched large-scale struggles for national independence and against racial discrimination. In Portuguese Mozambique and other places in this region, there have also been uprisings against colonial rule. The entire colonial rule of Western imperialist countries in Africa is tottering, and they can no longer continue to rule in the same way for a long time. The British colonialists' frenzied massacre and suppression of the people of Nyasaland is a desperate struggle to maintain their colonial rule in Africa. However, the greater the pressure, the stronger the resistance. No matter how frantically the British colonialists struggle, they will never be able to save their fate of complete failure in Africa.

    制止英国殖民者的血手！
    本报评论员
    英国殖民者对争取独立自由的英勇的尼亚萨兰人民，正进行着疯狂的屠杀和镇压。全世界一切同情被压迫民族的和有正义感的人们，都应该紧急行动起来，制止英帝国主义者的罪恶血手！
    英国殖民者不顾尼亚萨兰人民要求脱离“罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦”而完全独立的正义呼声，突然宣布尼亚萨兰全国处于“紧急状态”，禁止尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会活动，逮捕这个爱国组织的领袖班达等一百多人，并屠杀了大批手无寸铁的尼亚萨兰爱国人民，这是对尼亚萨兰人民和非洲人民欠下的又一笔血债。英国殖民者这一骇人听闻的野蛮暴行，已经激起了尼亚萨兰全国各地人民更加猛烈的反抗。尼亚萨兰首府松巴以及布兰太尔、卡隆加、尼亚萨湖恩卡塔湾等地都爆发了强大的群众示威运动，许多妇女和儿童也参加了斗争的行列。尽管英国殖民军队开枪镇压，示威人民却用棍棒和石头打开了恩卡塔湾的一座监狱，释放了那里的全部政治犯。英国殖民者以为用血腥的屠杀，就可以窒息尼亚萨兰人民争取独立斗争的火焰，事实证明那不过是妄想。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达最近就曾说过：“他们逮捕我起不了任何作用，尼亚萨兰现在已经觉醒了。不管我是死是活或是被监禁，尼亚萨兰总是觉醒了。”这充分地表达了尼亚萨兰人民对争取民族独立斗争的必胜信心。对这样英勇和充满胜利信心的民族，是英国殖民者用任何残暴的屠杀所绝对征服不了的。
    英国殖民者这次对尼亚萨兰人民进行疯狂的屠杀和镇压，是事先经过周密计划的最卑鄙的预谋。自上个月尼亚萨兰人民展开大规模斗争以后，英国殖民者立即采取了武装镇压的措施，但是却遭到尼亚萨兰人民更激烈的反抗，并激起了非洲和世界各国正义舆论的愤慨。接着，英国殖民者就一方面散布尼亚萨兰局势已经缓和，在那里不会宣布紧急状态等谎言，以麻痹尼亚萨兰人民，并欺骗世界舆论；一方面却从南罗得西亚、坦噶尼克等殖民地调集大量英国殖民军，进入尼亚萨兰内地，占据全国各紧要地带，准备镇压尼亚萨兰人民。英国殖民者这次对尼亚萨兰人民的血腥屠杀和镇压，是选择了尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会正在集会的时候进行的。路透社3月1日从布兰太尔发出的报道还说，尼亚萨兰各地“完全平静无事”；可是就在同一天，英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德却从亚丁匆匆赶回伦敦，立即发出了镇压尼亚萨兰人民的命令。伦诺克斯—波伊德3日在英国下院就尼亚萨兰问题召开的特别会议上，硬说英国对尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会采取镇压措施，是因为“这个组织准备暗杀欧洲、亚洲和温和的非洲人领袖”，不过是妄想推卸他们这种有计划的野蛮屠杀的罪责罢了。
    尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会是尼亚萨兰的一个主要政党。自从1953年英国殖民者把所谓“罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦”强加在尼亚萨兰人民头上以后，它一直同尼亚萨兰人民一道，对英国殖民者进行着斗争。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的政治主张，其实是温和的。它只要求解散联邦，在尼亚萨兰建立一个自治政府，然后分阶段走向完全独立，同时仍然留在英联邦之内。可是，就是这样温和的政治主张，英国殖民者也不肯接受，硬要把尼亚萨兰人民完全踩在它的脚底下，使尼亚萨兰人民永远不得翻身。当尼亚萨兰人民团结起来进行坚决斗争的时候，英国殖民者就露出了嗜血成性的本相，对尼亚萨兰人民发动了残暴的血腥屠杀。
    但是，英国殖民者对尼亚萨兰人民的残暴镇压，并不说明它有力量。而正是它在非洲的殖民统治情况十分不妙的表现。自从今年1月刚果人民争取民族独立斗争展开以后，中非洲、东非洲和南非洲各地的民族独立运动都有了很大的发展。而这些地方主要是在英国殖民者的统治之下，除尼亚萨兰以外，英国统治下的南罗得西亚、北罗得西亚、坦噶尼克、怯尼亚、南非联邦等地人民，都掀起了规模巨大的争取民族独立、反对种族歧视的斗争。而在这个地区的葡属莫三鼻给等地，也发生了反抗殖民统治的暴动。西方帝国主义国家在非洲的整个殖民统治正在摇摇欲坠，它们再也无法长期照旧统治下去了。英国殖民者对尼亚萨兰人民进行的疯狂屠杀和镇压，是力图维持它在非洲的殖民统治所作的绝望挣扎。不过压力愈大，反抗力也愈强。不管英国殖民者怎样疯狂挣扎，是绝对挽救不了它在非洲彻底失败的命运的。
