This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyuan on the 22nd reports: The vast number of farmers in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, are enthusiastically launching a competition movement where everyone learns from Li Tianzhu and everyone does more labor days. As of now, the number of people participating in this movement throughout the county has reached over 90,000.

Li Tianzhu is a member of the Chuandi Production Team of the Hongqi People's Commune in Pingshun Town. This 47-year-old middle-aged man, during the Great Leap Forward last year, rationally utilized his time, scientifically arranged his work, worked diligently and arduously, and cleverly combined major and auxiliary labor, completing 615 labor days last year. Recently, he said at a county-wide broadcast meeting that this year he would especially strive to reform tools and further improve labor efficiency to ensure that he completes 650 labor days throughout the year. He also issued a competition proposal to the county's farmers to do the work of two people.

After the launch of this movement, the attendance rate and labor efficiency of the members of the various people's communes have quickly improved, powerfully promoting the current spring plowing production. The attendance rates of communes such as Lizhuang and Beishe have increased from about 80% to over 95%. Zhang Baoquan and other twelve young members of the Xin'an Production Team of the Lizhuang Commune, who were delivering manure to the fields four miles away, originally only delivered six times a day, but after participating in the competition, they delivered ten times a day. The 1,400 members of the entire commune who are competing with Li Tianzhu have done more than 10,000 extra labor days in ten days.

Why can Li Tianzhu do 615 labor days a year? First of all, it is because of his high political consciousness and the establishment of the idea of ​​"taking the commune as his home." He was born into a poor peasant family in Linxian County, Henan Province. When he was six years old, his father carried him away to escape famine and came to Huguan County (formerly Pingshun County). When he was just able to work, he became a farmhand for the landlord, until the Communist Party came and he was completely liberated. From his long experience, he understood the reasons for his past poverty and why he is now able to live a happy life. He often tells others that the commune is his home and that he is the master of the commune. He does the work that others are unwilling to do, and he rushes to do the things that others do not want to do. Last year, the team had five skinny and small cows that no one wanted to feed, so he stepped forward and resolved to feed these five cows well. He cared for the livestock as if he were taking care of his own children. Soon, these five cows were fed so that they were fat and strong, and he was also rated by the masses as a model breeder in the team.

Li Tianzhu labors all year round according to the spirit of "diligence every day, diligence in everything, diligence everywhere"; "people don't walk empty, time doesn't pass empty." Regardless of whether it is busy or slack season, cloudy or sunny, he always works diligently from early morning to late night. In labor, he runs fast, hurries, does a lot of work, and has good quality. Every day, he always exceeds the quota. For example, when delivering manure to places like Yunayu (place name), others deliver four loads of manure in half a day, while he delivers six loads. This item alone added seventy labor days. In the spring, he takes a load of fertilizer to the field and brings back a load of soil (to pad the livestock pens); in the summer, he also takes a load of fertilizer to the field and brings back wormwood (to accumulate fertilizer and feed livestock); in the autumn, he brings crops back from the field; in the winter, he brings back straw. These jobs do not delay regular work, and he has therefore done seventy-five more labor days throughout the year. He also used his spare time to feed five cows and a foal for the team, doing one hundred and thirty-five labor days; watching the sheep resting and delivering meals to the sheep workers added thirty labor days. Even on cloudy and rainy days, he refused to let time pass by idly, and always found work to do, such as chopping grass, padding pens, peeling hemp, and repairing farm tools, doing fifteen labor days. In this way, during the Great Leap Forward last year, he created more wealth for the team, the country, and himself.

Li Tianzhu has a labor plan every day. He said, "After I finish today's work, I lie on the kang and think about what I will do tomorrow and how to do it, and I go to sleep only after I have thought it over." He seizes all the time to labor, and at the same time, he also pays attention to rest, truly achieving a combination of work and leisure. For example, watching the sheep resting is a heavy job, so he adopts the method of watching one night and resting two or three nights before watching again, rationally adjusting labor and rest time. In this way, he not only did more work and improved labor efficiency, but also did not affect his health. Therefore, people call him "King Kong Hero."

### 李天柱——一人做活顶两人  壶关掀起人人学天柱  个个多做劳动日运动

    李天柱——一人做活顶两人
    壶关掀起人人学天柱
    个个多做劳动日运动
    本报太原22日电　山西省壶关县的广大农民，正轰轰烈烈地开展着一个人人学习李天柱，个个多做劳动日的竞赛运动。截至目前为止，全县参加这一运动的人数达到九万余人。
    李天柱是平顺镇红旗人民公社川底生产队的社员，这个四十七岁的中年人，在去年大跃进中，由于他合理利用时间，科学安排活计，勤劳苦干，把主要劳动和辅助劳动巧妙地结合起来，去年做了六百一十五个劳动日。最近，他在全县广播大会上说，今年特别要努力改革工具，进一步提高劳动效率，保证全年做到六百五十个劳动日。并向全县农民群众发出了一人做活顶两人的竞赛倡议。
    这一运动开展后，各人民公社社员们的出勤率和劳动效率很快得到提高，有力地推动了当前的春耕生产。李庄、北社等公社的出勤率都由原来的80％左右提高到了95％以上。李庄公社辛安生产队张保全等十二个青年社员，往四里远的地里送粪，原来一天只送六次，参加竞赛以后，每天送到十次。全社和李天柱竞赛的一千四百个社员，十天内就多做劳动日一万多个。
    李天柱为什么一年能做六百一十五个劳动日呢？首先由于他的政治觉悟高，树立了“以社为家”的思想。他出身在河南省林县的一个贫农家庭里，六岁上就被父亲担着逃荒来到了壶关县（原平顺县），当他刚刚能劳动的时候就给地主当了长工，直到共产党来了才彻底翻了身。他从漫长的经历中懂得了过去为什么贫困和现在为什么能够过上幸福生活的道理。他常常对别人说，公社就是自己的家，自己就是公社的主人。别人不愿干的活他去干，别人不想做的事他抢着做。去年社里有五头又瘦又小的牛没人喂，他便挺身而出，决心把这五头牛喂好。他喂养牲口像照顾自己的孩子一样，不久，这五头牛喂得又肥又胖，他也被群众评为社里的模范饲养员。
    李天柱一年四季都按“日日勤，事事勤，处处勤”；“人不空走，时不空过”的精神劳动着。不管在农忙农闲、天阴天晴，总是起早搭黑辛勤劳动。劳动中他跑的快，赶的紧，作活多，质量好。每天总是超额完成定额。如往芣纳于（地名）等地送粪，别人半天送四担粪，他送六担。仅这一项，就多做了劳动日七十个。春天，他上地捎担肥料，回家捎担土（给牲口垫圈）；夏天，他上地也是捎担肥料，回家捎割蒿草（积肥、喂牲口）；秋天，从地里往回捎庄稼；冬天往回捎秸秆。这些活儿都不耽误整工，全年因此多做了七十五个劳动日。他还利用空隙时间给社里喂了五头牛、一头马驹，作了一百三十五个劳动日；看羊卧地，给羊工送饭作了三十个劳动日。就是天阴下雨，他也不肯把时间空空放过，总是找活干，如铡草、垫圈、剥麻、修理农具等，作了十五个劳动日。就这样他在去年大跃进当中，为社为国家也为自己创造了更多的财富。
    李天柱每天都有个劳动计划，他说：“我做完今天的事，往炕上一躺，就想着明天干什么和怎样干，想好了才睡觉。”他抓紧一切时间进行劳动，同时也很注意休息，真正做到了有劳有逸。比如看羊卧地是一件重活，他就采取看一夜、休息两夜至三夜再看的办法，合理调剂劳动和休息时间。这样，他既多做了活计，提高了劳动效率，也不影响身体健康。因此，人们都叫他“金钢英雄”。
