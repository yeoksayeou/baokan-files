Vigorously Manufacture Irrigation and Drainage Machinery to Ensure a Bumper Harvest of Grain and Cotton
The First Ministry of Machine Building Requires Complete Sets to be Supplied, Each Guaranteed for Use

(Our Dispatch) In order to meet the needs of farmland irrigation and drainage, ensure a bumper summer harvest in agriculture, and achieve the leap forward targets for grain and cotton, the First Ministry of Machine Building recently assigned production tasks for irrigation and drainage power machinery to various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and relevant directly subordinate factories.

According to the assigned tasks, the output of irrigation and drainage power machinery this year will increase by more than double compared to last year. To ensure spring irrigation and not delay the farming season, the majority of irrigation and drainage power machinery is required to be completed before the end of April. The arrangement of this task is mainly based on local production and local use, with only a few areas with larger demand and insufficient production capacity receiving a portion allocated from increased production in other areas.

According to statistics from relevant departments, as of February 20th, the total power of irrigation and drainage machinery produced nationwide was only over 170,000 horsepower, with the majority needing to be manufactured in March and April. At the same time, since last winter, some areas have experienced little rain and snow, or abnormal temperatures. Rushing to produce irrigation and drainage power machinery is a very important and urgent task for preventing drought and flood, and ensuring a bumper harvest. Therefore, the First Ministry of Machine Building requires all localities to act quickly. In addition to organizing specialized factories, it is also necessary to vigorously organize the strength of local small and medium-sized machinery factories to complete the task through a concentrated effort. All localities should uniformly allocate the raw materials needed for the production of irrigation and drainage power machinery according to the task scheduling situation. All factories must launch a mass movement centered on technological revolution, improve product structure, adopt substitute materials, utilize indigenous steel and iron, and vigorously save steel and pig iron; promote advanced technologies, improve operating methods, tap equipment potential, and increase production capacity; pay attention to product quality, and ensure that each machine is guaranteed for use. Strive to complete the production tasks of irrigation and drainage power machinery on time, with quality, and in quantity.

The First Ministry of Machine Building also requires all localities to strengthen the work of complete sets of irrigation and drainage power machinery, arrange tasks in complete sets, allocate materials in complete sets, and supply rural areas in complete sets. At the same time, all localities are required to strengthen repair and maintenance work, give full play to the role of existing irrigation and drainage power machinery, and actively train technical personnel.

At present, all localities have taken active action. Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jilin, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and other provinces and autonomous regions have successively held production meetings for irrigation and drainage machinery, or formulated production progress plans, and comprehensively arranged production tasks. Hebei Province also held a material balance meeting to solve the problem of material supply needed for the production of irrigation and drainage machinery; the province and some special districts established irrigation and drainage offices to unified command the production and supply of irrigation and drainage machinery.

Hebei Has Already Produced More Than Five Thousand Units

(Our Dispatch) In order to support the needs of spring irrigation in rural areas, various parts of Hebei Province have entered a tense stage of rushing to produce irrigation and drainage machinery. In February, the province produced a total of 5,061 sets of irrigation and drainage power machinery, reaching 44,590.5 horsepower. At the same time, many production units have completed trial production and are fully prepared for production, and will work hard in March to ensure the needs of spring irrigation and support a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production.

Party committees in many regions have strengthened their leadership over the work of rushing to produce irrigation and drainage machinery. Baoding Special District has assigned a secretary to take charge from the special district to the county, achieving "layer-by-layer assignment of tasks, tightly linking each link," and adopted measures of assigning tasks, assigning key points, and determining people, tasks, and time, successfully completing the February production plan. In Tianjin and Tangshan and other places, employees of many factories have launched a vigorous red flag competition movement to resolutely complete the production tasks of irrigation and drainage machinery.

In the process of rushing to produce irrigation and drainage machinery, in addition to strengthening technical learning and promoting advanced experience, workers in various regions have also visited commune members in rural areas and further improved the quality of irrigation and drainage machinery according to the requirements of the commune members. All factories have also further improved the inspection system to ensure that the machines leaving the factory are easy to use and durable. Shulu County No. 2 Machinery Factory established a three-inspection system (self-inspection, mutual inspection, inspector inspection) and strictly accepted finished products in accordance with the drawings.

Shanghai Strives to Deliver All Goods in April

(Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) Machinery workers in Shanghai are rushing to produce irrigation and drainage equipment. They are striving to complete the manufacturing task of more than 40,000 horsepower diesel engines and 900 water pumps on time, with quality, and in quantity before the end of April.

After receiving the task of manufacturing large water pumps, the Shanghai Machine Factory re-arranged production. They listed the manufacturing of water pumps as the most urgent and important task of the entire factory. In addition to special materials for special purposes, they also cleared their warehouses and found steel that could be used for the pump bodies of more than 130 water pumps, filling the missing part of the materials.

In order to build high-quality and high-efficiency diesel engines for the peasant brothers, the workers of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory used the method of increasing the belt pulley to eliminate the flywheel housing and flywheel on the diesel engine, which not only reduced the weight of the machine, but also increased the power by two horsepower. Now the factory has rushed to produce nearly 300 diesel engines.

In other machine factories in Shanghai that are responsible for manufacturing irrigation and drainage equipment, employees have also launched a red flag competition between classes, groups, and individuals, striving to complete production tasks quickly and well and support agricultural production.

Many Factories in Lushun-Dalian Complete Tasks

(Our Dispatch) Many factories in Lushun-Dalian City have completed the task of manufacturing irrigation and drainage equipment ahead of schedule.

Dalian No. 1 Machinery Manufacturing Factory completed the task of one hundred sets of irrigation and drainage equipment nine days ahead of schedule. This batch of irrigation and drainage equipment includes fifty rotary drilling machines and fifty fixed winches for building reservoirs. After the factory assigned the task of irrigation and drainage equipment to the workshop, every worker actively and proactively strived to contribute to supporting the great leap forward in agriculture. Some workers did not go home during the Spring Festival in order to rush to produce irrigation and drainage equipment. They said: Completing the manufacturing task of irrigation and drainage machinery one day earlier will provide greater guarantee for a greater bumper harvest in agriculture.

Dalian Instrument Factory, which is responsible for the supporting task of irrigation and drainage equipment, has completed three-quarters of the supporting task for the first quarter, and more than 3,000 oil pressure gauges and steam pressure gauges have been delivered. They strive to complete the irrigation and drainage supporting task for the first quarter 15 days ahead of schedule. (Attached Picture)
