Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 20th: The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party passed a resolution on the basic tasks of the party's policy at its morning session on the 19th.

The resolution stated that the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party fully approved the political line pointed out by Comrade Gomulka in the summary report of the Central Committee.

The resolution pointed out that the current political line pursued by the Party has fully withstood the test of life. This line was formulated by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and developed in several Central Committee plenary sessions after the Eighth Plenary Session. Because the Party followed this political line, it strengthened the unity of its ranks and strengthened its ties with the working class and the people; it repelled the attacks of the reactionary elements who attempted to undermine the people's democratic system; it overcame the dogmatic and sectarian errors that had adversely affected the Party's previous policies; it shattered the revisionist and opportunist tendencies that once threatened the Party with ideological disintegration in the face of class enemies; it expanded inner-Party democracy and socialist democracy in society, strengthened the rule of law, and enhanced the prestige of the people's power; it took practical and effective efforts to overcome the disproportions in developing the economy and improving the living standards of workers; it improved the management and planning system in the national economy, opening up broad possibilities for the initiative of the working class, economic cadres, and Party cadres; it ensured a more rapid growth of agricultural production, improved the situation in rural areas, eliminated distortions in the relationship between the state and the countryside, and strengthened the worker-peasant alliance.

The Congress believes that, as a result of this policy, the current Five-Year Plan is being successfully implemented in all major economic sectors, which creates a foundation for the further socialist development of the country.

The Congress believes that the Party, adhering to the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, has strengthened its solidarity with fraternal parties and strengthened the unity of the socialist camp.

The Party has guided the country's foreign policy, enhanced Poland's prestige on the international stage, and increased the Party's contribution to the struggle for easing tensions and safeguarding international peace.

The Congress believes that the basis of the Party's political line put forward in the Central Committee's summary report is the creative application of Marxist-Leninist principles to solve Poland's historical tasks of building socialism.

The resolution then analyzed the current international situation. The resolution pointed out that the most prominent feature of the contemporary era is the competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system. This competition is taking place in all areas of social and political life. The rapid and continuous growth of industrial production is a universal law of socialist development. This has now irrefutably proven the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

The resolution pointed out that the shift in the balance of world forces in favor of the socialist system creates increasingly favorable conditions for solving the most important and pressing issue of contemporary humanity—safeguarding world peace.

Speaking of the German question, the resolution pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the German Democratic Republic's proposal on establishing a confederation of the two existing German states offer the only correct solution to the German question. The Congress fully endorsed the Polish government's position of fully supporting these two peaceful proposals. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany and implementing the Soviet Union's correct proposal on transforming West Berlin into a free city are in line with Poland's most vital interests, as well as the interests of the German people and the interests of peace and European security.

The resolution went on to say that the Congress believes that fraternal friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union is the foundation of Poland's foreign policy. This is the decisive, lasting, and eternal factor in our foreign policy. The foundation of Polish-Soviet friendship is a profound ideological commonality and the Leninist principle of internationalism, stemming from the needs of both countries and conforming to Poland's vital interests. Poland is developing fraternal friendly relations and cooperation with its neighbors—Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries. Poland has a deep friendship with the People's Republic of China, which is rapidly developing into a modern, powerful socialist country and is successfully crushing the imperialists' adventurous plans in the Far East.

The resolution then pointed out that Poland pursues a policy of peaceful cooperation and developing relations with all countries that desire peaceful cooperation, regardless of their systems. The Congress endorsed Poland's foreign policy, expressed support for all constructive activities aimed at easing international tensions, and expressed solidarity with the liberation struggles waged by the peoples of all countries under imperialist oppression.

The Congress believes that the main direction of the country's foreign policy is to strengthen the unbreakable solidarity of the socialist camp on the basis of the principles of mutual assistance, equality, and solidarity.

The resolution continued by saying that the international communist and workers' movement has now become a great and invincible force, and its unity and solidarity are of great significance to the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. Only the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, due to its revisionist stance, stands outside the ranks of the international communist movement. Its revisionist stance undermines the unity of the communist parties and socialist countries.

The resolution pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union holds a leading position among the communist parties of all countries. This is a position given to it by history, because under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first and most powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union—was established, which is the greatest achievement of the entire international communist movement and the bulwark of socialism.

The Congress endorsed the program put forward in the directives of the 1961-1965 national economic plan for further developing the country's socialist economy and improving the people's livelihood and welfare.

The Congress believes that it is correct that the development of the means of production industry should be faster than the production of consumer goods, and believes that under the conditions of a small commodity economy, it is impossible to fundamentally solve the social and production problems of the countryside. To do this, it is necessary to carry out the socialist transformation of the countryside on the principle of production cooperation. The movement for production cooperation will not develop spontaneously. In order for the movement for production cooperation to develop, the Party and its allies among the peasant masses must carry out enormous and patient organizational and political work.

The Congress affirmed that the realization of the future Five-Year Plan will be a further major victory in the country's development.

The Congress believes that the Party's basic political task is to rely on the achievements of the country's economic development to unite the entire working class and all working people in urban and rural areas to jointly build a new socialist society. The task facing the Party is to mobilize the public to fight for compliance with laws and social norms, and for compliance with national and social discipline.

The resolution then pointed out that it is necessary to continuously improve the work of the people's police and the state security organs. Strengthening national defense forces, especially the combat effectiveness of the Polish army, improving the combat readiness and political level of officers, young commanders and soldiers, strengthening army-civilian relations, and educating all soldiers with the spirit of boundless loyalty to the people's Poland, the spirit of being ready to sacrifice themselves at any time to defend Poland's security, and the spirit of combat friendship with the Soviet army and the armed forces of socialist countries are also very important tasks.

The Congress believes that promoting socialist democracy and expanding the positive social foundation of the people's state depends first and foremost on the Party's leading role.

The Party leads all organs of the people's power, and it is the helmsman and inspirer of these organs. It cannot relax or weaken its political supervision for a minute.

When discussing the Party's tasks on the scientific and cultural fronts, the resolution pointed out that the Party's goal in scientific work is to ensure the complete victory of Marxism-Leninism. The Party advocates freedom of academic discussion and allowing scientists to resolve academic disputes themselves. However, the Party cannot tolerate anti-socialist positions, nor can it tolerate the use of academic activities and academic publications to attack the Party's policies and the socialist system. The basic principle of the Party's cultural policy is that cultural creation should be based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview and method. The Party's main task on the cultural front should be to thoroughly eliminate the anti-socialist and revisionist tendencies in the creative community and creative organizations. Because now, under the conditions of the Party's correct cultural policy, these tendencies are the main obstacle to the development of Poland's socialist culture.

The resolution emphasized that the Polish United Workers' Party follows the time-tested Marxist-Leninist principles in its activities. Our Party combines the principled loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of creatively applying them to the concrete, historically formed national conditions.

The Congress believes that the argument in the resolution of the Party's First Congress about the existence of right-leaning nationalist tendencies within the Party is unfounded and erroneous, and therefore cancels the resolution on this issue.

The resolution pointed out that in the current stage, revisionism is the main danger to the Party, because revisionism has an objective connection with the anti-socialist attempts of bourgeois forces at home and abroad. The danger of revisionism lies in the fact that it undermines the Party's ideological unity from within, spreads distrust of communism, of the Party's leading role, and of the dictatorship of the proletariat, causing great harm during the Party's difficult periods. The target of revisionists' attacks is the unity of the socialist camp and proletarian internationalism. The Party's resolute counterattack against revisionism has become a necessary condition for thoroughly overcoming dogmatism and sectarianism. The resolution said that among the comrades who were once lost and confined in the dogmatic shell for some time, the majority of them today are in step with the Party under the influence of the Party's correct political line. The Congress believes that the Party has basically achieved ideological and organizational unity.

The Congress believes that the primary tasks in the Party's work are as follows: First, to overcome the situation where the Party's ideological education work cannot keep up with the situation, and to fully launch an offensive of Marxist-Leninist ideology and socialist ideology. Second, to improve the quality of the Party by continuously absorbing advanced elements from the working class and other strata of the working people into the Party, while at the same time removing alien elements and opportunists from the Party. Third, to strengthen the Party's leading position by improving the methods of leading the people's state. Fourth, to focus the main attention of Party organizations on realizing the program for developing the people's Poland adopted by the Congress, especially on solving the economic tasks that are the decisive front of the entire socialist construction.

The resolution concluded by saying that our Party is loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism and to the unshakable unity of the socialist camp. It has been, is, and will always be loyal to the Polish working class and the Polish people.

The historical task of our generation is to build socialism in our country. Our Party leads the construction of socialism, drawing strength from the inexhaustible energy of the Polish working people. If our Party can unite in work and struggle, can unite the working class and all the people, and if we can follow the creative revolutionary doctrines of Marx and Lenin, then nothing can surpass our strength.

The banner of Marxism-Leninism will lead us to new victories.

    波兰党代会通过关于党的政策基本任务的决议
    团结全党全民沿着社会主义大道迈进
    加强社会主义阵营的团结是波兰对外政策主要方针
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会19日上午会议通过了关于党的政策的基本任务的决议。
    决议说，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会完全批准哥穆尔卡同志在中央委员会总结报告中所指出的政治路线。
    决议指出，目前党所奉行的政治路线完全经受住了生活的考验，这个路线是八中全会所拟定的，并且在八中全会以后的几次中央全会上得到了发展。党由于遵循了这个政治路线，加强了自己队伍的团结和加强了同工人阶级和人民的联系；打退了企图破坏人民民主制度的反动派的进攻；克服了对党的以前的政策产生不良影响的教条主义和宗派主义的错误；粉碎了修正主义和机会主义的倾向，这种倾向曾经使党在阶级敌人的面前遭到思想上瓦解的威胁；扩大了党内民主和社会上的社会主义民主，加强了法制和提高了人民政权的威信；采取了实际而有成效的努力，克服在发展经济和提高职工生活方面的比例失调现象；改善了国民经济中的管理和计划制度，为工人阶级和经济干部以及党的干部的主动性开辟了广泛的可能性；保证了农业生产更迅速的增长，改善了农村的状况，消除了对国家同农村关系的歪曲，加强了工农联盟。
    代表大会认为，由于这个政策，现在的五年计划在所有主要的经济部门中都在顺利地实现，这就为国家进一步的社会主义发展创造了基础。
    代表大会认为，党遵循着无产阶级国际主义的列宁主义原则，加强了同兄弟党的团结关系，加强了社会主义阵营的团结。
    党指导着国家的外交政策，提高了波兰在国际舞台上的威信，增加了党对争取局势和缓和国际和平的斗争的贡献。
    代表大会认为，中央总结报告中提出的党的政治路线的根据是，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义原则来解决波兰建设社会主义的历史任务。
    决议接着分析了当前的国际局势。决议指出，当代最显著的特点是世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系的竞赛。这种竞赛在社会和政治生活的各个领域中进行着。工业生产的迅速和不断的增长是社会主义发展的普遍规律。这一点现在已经无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。
    决议指出，世界力量对比发生有利于社会主义体系的变化，这就为解决当代人类最重要的切身问题——维护世界和平——创造了越来越有利的条件。
    在谈到德国问题时，决议指出，苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议中和德意志民主共和国关于建立两个现存的德国的邦联的建议中提出了唯一正确的解决德国问题的办法。代表大会完全赞同波兰政府的完全支持这两个和平建议的立场。缔结对德和约和实现苏联关于变西柏林为自由城市的正确建议，既符合于波兰的最切身的利益，也符合于德国人民以及和平和欧洲安全的利益。
    决议接着说，代表大会认为，同苏联的兄弟的友谊和联盟是波兰对外政策的基础。这是我们对外政策的决定性的、持久和永恒的因素。波苏友谊的基础是深刻的思想共同性和列宁主义的国际主义原则，是出于两国的需要，符合于波兰的切身利益。波兰同邻邦——捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国以及其他人民民主国家发展着兄弟般的友好关系和合作。波兰同中华人民共和国有着深厚的友谊，中国正在以飞快的速度发展成为现代化的、强大的社会主义国家，正在成功地摧毁帝国主义者在远东的冒险计划。
    决议接着指出，波兰奉行的政策是和平合作以及同所有希望和平合作的国家发展关系，不管它们的制度如何。代表大会赞同波兰的外交政策，表示支持旨在缓和国际紧张局势的一切建设性活动，声援在帝国主义压迫下的各国人民所进行的解放斗争。
    代表大会认为，国家对外政策的主要方针是在互助、平等和团结原则的基础上加强社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结。
    决议中接着说，国际共产主义运动和工人运动如今已经变成一支伟大的、不可战胜的力量，它的团结一致对争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争具有重大意义。只有南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟，由于它的修正主义立场而处在国际共产主义运动的队伍之外。它的修正主义立场破坏共产党和社会主义国家的团结一致。
    决议指出，苏联共产党在世界各国共产党中居于首要地位。这是历史给与它这个地位的。因为在苏联共产党的领导下建立起了第一个最强大的社会主义国家——苏联，它是整个国际共产主义运动的最大成果和社会主义的堡垒。
    代表大会赞同1961—1965年国民经济计划指示中提出的、进一步发展国家的社会主义经济和提高人民生活福利的纲领。
    代表大会认为，生产资料工业的发展要比消费资料的生产发展快，这是正确的，并且认为在小商品经济的条件下，是无法从根本上解决农村的社会和生产问题的。要做到这一点，只有在生产合作化的原则上对农村实行社会主义改造。生产合作化的运动不是会
  自流发展的。为了使生产合作化运动得到发展，党和它在农民群众中的同盟者必须进行巨大的、耐心的组织工作和政治工作。
    代表大会确认，未来的五年计划的实现将是国家发展方面的进一步的重大胜利。
    代表大会认为党的基本政治任务就是依靠国家经济发展的成就，把整个工人阶级以及城乡全体劳动人民团结在一起，来共同建设新的社会主义社会。党所面临的任务是动员公众为遵守法律和社会生活准则，为遵守国家和社会的纪律而斗争。
    决议接着指出，必须不断改进民警和国家保安机关的工作。加强国防力量，特别是波兰军队的战斗力，提高军官、年青的指战员和士兵的战斗素养和政治水平，加强军民联系，用无限忠诚于人民波兰、时刻准备为保卫波兰的安全而自我牺牲的精神，用同苏联军队和社会主义国家武装部队的战斗友谊的精神来教育全体士兵，这也是十分重要的任务。
    代表大会认为，发扬社会主义民主和扩大人民国家积极的社会基础首先取决于党的领导作用。
    党领导人民政权的一切机关，它是这些机关的舵手和鼓舞者，一分钟也不能放松和削弱自己的政治监督。
    决议在谈到党在科学和文化战线上的任务时指出，党在科学工作方面的目的是保证马克思列宁主义的完全胜利。党主张学术讨论自由和由科学家自己来解决学术争论。但是，党不能容忍敌视社会主义的立场，不能容忍利用学术活动和学术出版物来攻击党的政策和社会主义制度。党的文化政策的基本原则是：文化创作要以马克思列宁主义的世界观和方法作为基础。党在文化战线上的主要任务应该是彻底清除创作界和创作组织中的反社会主义和修正主义倾向。因为在现在，在党的正确的文化政策的条件下，这些倾向是发展波兰的社会主义文化的主要障碍。
    决议强调指出，波兰统一工人党在自己的活动中遵循着久经考验的马克思列宁主义原则。我们党把对马克思列宁主义原理的原则性的忠诚和把它们创造性地运用到具体的、历史上形成的民族条件中去的实践结合起来。
    代表大会认为，党的第一次代表大会的决议中关于党内存在右倾民族主义倾向这一论点，是没有根据的和错误的，因此取消关于这一问题的决议。
    决议指出，在现阶段，修正主义是党的主要危险，因为修正主义同国内外资产阶级势力的反社会主义企图有着客观的联系。修正主义的危险在于它从内部破坏党的思想统一，散布对共产主义、对党的领导作用、对无产阶级专政的不信任，在党的困难时期造成了巨大的危害。修正主义者攻击的对象是社会主义阵营的团结和无产阶级国际主义。党对修正主义的坚决反击，成了彻底克服教条主义和宗派主义的必要条件。决议说，在某些时期曾经迷失方向和关闭在教条主义硬壳中的同志当中，有大多数人今天在党的正确的政治路线的影响下同党的步调一致起来了。代表大会认为，党基本上达到了思想上和组织上的团结。
    代表大会认为，在党的工作方面首要的任务如下：第一、克服党的思想教育工作跟不上形势的状况，全面展开马克思列宁主义思想、社会主义思想的攻势。第二、通过不断吸收工人阶级和劳动人民其他阶层中先进分子入党，同时从党内清除异己分子和机会主义分子的方法，来提高党的质量。第三、通过改善对人民国家的领导方法的途径来加强党的领导地位。第四、集中党组织的主要注意力来实现代表大会所通过的发展人民波兰的纲领，特别是解决那些作为整个社会主义建设决定性战线的经济任务。
    决议最后说，我们党忠于无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，忠于社会主义阵营的不可动摇的团结一致，它过去、现在和将来永远忠于波兰工人阶级、波兰人民。
    我们这一代的历史任务是在我国建成社会主义。我们党领导着社会主义建设，从波兰劳动人民的无穷无尽的精力中汲取力量。如果我们党在工作和斗争中能够团结一致，能够团结工人阶级和全体人民，如果我们能遵循马克思和列宁的创造性的革命学说，那么，任何东西也不能超过我们的力量。
    马克思列宁主义的旗帜将引导我们走向新的胜利。
