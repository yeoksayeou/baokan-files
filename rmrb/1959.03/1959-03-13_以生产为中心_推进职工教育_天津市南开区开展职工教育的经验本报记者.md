Taking Production as the Center and Promoting Worker Education
—Experience of Nankai District, Tianjin in Carrying Out Worker Education
By Our Newspaper Reporter

Nankai District is a factory district in Tianjin. Here, in the Great Leap Forward of last year, worker education in factories of all sizes throughout the district was in full swing. The number of various types of worker schools increased from eleven in 1957 to two hundred and eighty-five, and the enrollment rate of young and middle-aged workers increased from 34.6% in 1957 to about 96.5%, with attendance rates generally reaching over 80%. It truly was: the workshop machines were humming, the classrooms were filled with the sound of reading, a scene of prosperity.

　　Secretaries Take the Lead, Unified Leadership

The vigorous situation in worker education in Nankai District is mainly due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership over worker education. From the district committee to the grassroots Party organizations, secretaries at all levels took the lead, systematically contracted tasks, and truly ensured that worker education became a concern for everyone.

Originally, only relevant departments cared about worker education, while other departments thought it was "not their business." Even within the Party, there were different views on how to carry out worker education. Some people thought that education conflicted with production and often wanted to squeeze out study time. During the Great Leap Forward last year, this issue was brought to the agenda of the district committee. After several discussions at the district committee meetings, a unified understanding was reached. The first secretary of the district committee first clearly put forward the relationship between technological revolution and cultural revolution promoting each other, and personally started to grasp education. Worker education was frequently discussed at the Secretariat meetings and Standing Committee meetings, and important issues were promptly resolved and issued to Party committees at all levels for implementation. In the past two months, the Standing Committee of the District Committee has discussed worker education five times, convened two worker education conferences, and issued three special written instructions.

Among the Party organizations and administrative leading cadres at the grassroots level, some initially did not see the mutually promoting role of production and education, and one-sidedly emphasized the contradiction between education and production. Some said: "There are already many production tasks now, why bother with studying, it's too troublesome!" Others said: "I grasp production with one hand and life with the other, where do I have a third hand to grasp education?" Most people thought: education is a good thing, let's talk about it when we have time later. Based on this situation, the district committee launched a three-day special forum and debate on the Party's education policy among grassroots Party branch secretaries, factory directors, and leading cadres at a conference, so that the vast majority of people clearly realized that socialist factories must not only produce new products, but also cultivate technical cadres and talents for the country, and that only a good factory director or a good branch secretary could manage both production and education. In this way, the whole Party united production and learning into one rope, and everyone began to pay attention to worker education.

Now, in order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over worker education, the Nankai District Committee of the Communist Party of China has established a relatively complete leadership system. In the district, the district party secretary takes the lead, and the departments of culture and education, industry, finance and trade, trade unions, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League jointly form the leading core. Each department of the district committee and each bureau of the district people's committee has a full-time deputy minister or deputy director in charge of education. Large factories and company party organizations have established education committees, and even workshops have deputy branch secretaries and deputy workshop directors in charge of worker education. In this way, under the unified leadership of the district committee, the district's worker education work becomes a whole, systematically contracted from top to bottom, with responsibility at each level, presenting a new situation.

　　Education Serves Production

"Will education affect production?" This is a question of concern to many production departments. Nankai District takes production as the center to carry out worker education, and learning has become a force to promote production.

All units have adopted many methods to arrange teaching work with production as the center, including the rational arrangement of learning and production time, and linking the production reality of the factory and the living reality of the workers in the compilation of teaching materials and the teaching of courses. The textbooks compiled by many factories in this way are both flexible and vivid and enlightening for the workers. The language teachers of the Beida Dyeing Factory Workers' School compiled the advanced deeds of Li Shaoshan, a worker in the factory who solved the problem of whitening in the dyeing of vulcanized blue cloth, into teaching materials. The workers were greatly inspired. After finishing this class, the workers immediately learned from Li Shaoshan's example and put forward forty-three rationalization proposals. The workers reflected: "Taking such a class really solves problems, learns culture, and receives education."

Numerous facts have proved that learning and production are not contradictory, but promote each other. From the perspective of the entire Nankai District, after 96.5% of the people participated in learning, not only was production not affected, but the production plan was overfulfilled. After the workers learned cultural and technical knowledge, the technical innovations, inventions and creations, and a large number of rationalization proposals brought great benefits to production. All the employees of a state-owned factory who could enroll have enrolled. In the second half of last year, they participated in the technical innovation movement while studying, and put forward more than 6,100 suggestions. The factory party committee said in summarizing the workers' spare-time study: "If we persist in cultural study, it will not only not affect production, but also promote production." According to a recent survey conducted by the Nankai District Committee on fourteen factories, the seven factories with general schooling completed 161% of the total value of production plan in 1958, while the seven factories with good schooling completed 195%.

　　Mobilize the Masses, Rely on the Masses

In the past, Nankai District was mostly composed of small and medium-sized factories and workshops with simple equipment and low cultural levels of workers. However, the "poorer" they were, the greater their enthusiasm, and the "whiter" they were, the more they wanted to make revolution. Under this situation of "poverty and blankness," the workers urgently demanded to learn culture and technology to change their appearance. With the Great Leap Forward last year, this demand became even more urgent.

The Party organizations at all levels in Nankai District correctly recognized and understood the demands of the masses, and relied on the masses to mobilize the masses. First of all, they mobilized the masses ideologically. Through propaganda, education, and debates, they made the masses correctly realize the important significance of learning ideologically, and made learning a conscious demand of the workers. After the industrial system held a work conference on worker-peasant education by the District Committee, 90% of the factories conveyed it to the workers, 50% of the factories organized the masses to conduct forums and debates, and 40% of the factories also conducted in-depth group discussions. After the workers clarified the great significance of learning cultural and technical knowledge, they laid an ideological foundation for the development of worker education. In the forums and debates, some factory workers directly criticized the leading cadres who did not pay attention to learning and ignored the demands of the workers. The factory leading cadres accepted the workers' criticism, made self-criticism to the masses, and quickly took measures to grasp worker education.

After the masses are mobilized, it is necessary to further rely on the masses to find ways to solve problems such as classrooms, equipment, and teachers. Most of the difficulties in running schools in most units in Nankai District are solved in this way. The Satellite United Factory School, jointly run by twelve small factories and handicraft production cooperatives, was built with the efforts of everyone. The masses worked together to build two factory school offices by themselves, borrowed classrooms from nearby elementary schools for classes, and each unit took the initiative to find ways to draw out thirteen full-time teachers from the workers. The school was set up in five days, and more than 1,200 people participated in the study. All the young and middle-aged workers were enrolled.

In solving the problem of teachers, many worker schools in Nankai District also adopted the method of the mass line. A group of workers with good political quality and teaching conditions were recommended and promoted by the workers, and trained to serve as teachers. Worker representatives participate in the school affairs committee composed of worker schools, which plays an important role in the work of the school. Under the school, worker-organized class committees and study groups and other organizations carry out activities among the students, maintain study order, carry out mutual assistance in learning, help solve difficulties in learning, and ensure the improvement of study attendance rate.

　　Proper Arrangement, Guarantee Attendance

Properly arranging the workers' learning, production and life is an important key to ensuring enrollment, attendance, and that workers can regularly persist in learning.

The average attendance rate of more than 200 worker schools in Nankai District reaches more than 80%. The main reason is that the Party committee has made comprehensive arrangements for the workers' production, life, and learning. The district committee has made a special decision to check the attendance rate of workers' learning in grassroots units at various times. Relevant systems have specifically and properly arranged learning, production, and life according to their own circumstances. In factories, in order to ensure workers' learning, labor organizations have been rationally adjusted, and the time for various meetings and social activities has been rearranged. Under normal circumstances, learning time is generally not occupied. For changes in class time in worker schools, certain procedures for requesting instructions and approval are stipulated. When encountering special circumstances that must occupy study time, it is generally stipulated that make-up classes be arranged to ensure that learning is uninterrupted.

Under the leadership of the Finance and Trade Department of the District Committee, the spare-time schools for commercial system workers organized workers from nine industries and more than 600 stores, shops, and handicraft cooperatives to discuss according to the different situations of the units, and conducted specific investigations and analyses in the stores. According to the special busy and leisure patterns of commercial workers, the study time was properly arranged separately. Three study times are stipulated every day, and workers can choose to participate in learning according to their own circumstances. Those who are busy during the day study at night; those who are busy in the morning study in the afternoon; those who are busy at night take time to study during the day. Workers who are busy all day take turns to participate in learning in three shifts. There are more than 7,000 people enrolled. The result of this trial practice is that it guarantees learning without affecting business and the normal rest of workers, so that the attendance rate of students is often maintained above 90%.

Recently, the Nankai District Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an inspection of the work of worker education in the district, checking the progress of worker education in more than 100 factories, stores, and production cooperatives. According to the survey results of 61 factories, the attendance rate of factories with good arrangements is very high. For example, one factory reached 100%. Nine factories reached more than 90%, and only more than a dozen factories had a learning attendance rate of less than 60%. The reason for the low attendance rate in these factories is mainly because they have not properly arranged and solved the difficulties in workers' learning. For example, there are many female students in the spare-time school of the Satellite Carpet Factory. Because the problem of female workers' nurseries has not been solved, the learning attendance rate is generally only more than 60%. After inspection, the factory was helped to find rooms and increase childcare workers to solve the childcare problem for female workers, and the attendance rate rose to more than 80%.

    以生产为中心  推进职工教育
    ——天津市南开区开展职工教育的经验
    本报记者
    南开区是天津市的一个工厂区。在这里，去年大跃进中，全区大小工厂的职工教育搞得热火朝天，各类职工学校由1957年的十一所增加到二百八十五所，青壮年职工入学率由1957年的34.6％上升到96.5％左右，学习出勤率一般达到80％以上。真个是：车间机器响，课堂读书声，一片兴旺气象。
      书记挂帅，统一领导
    南开区职工教育出现热气腾腾的局面，主要是加强了党对职工教育的领导，从区委到基层的党组织，层层书记挂帅，系统包干，切实做到使职工教育成为大家都关怀的工作。
    原来，只有有关部门才关心职工教育工作，其它部门认为“与己无关”，甚至在党内对如何开展职工教育也有不同的看法，有些人认为教育与生产有矛盾，经常想着挤学习。在去年大跃进中，这个问题就提到了区委会的议程上来。经过区委会议的几次讨论，统一了思想，区委第一书记首先明确提出了技术革命和文化革命相互促进的关系，亲自动手抓教育。在书记处会议和常委会上经常讨论职工教育工作，重大问题及时作出决议，下达到各级党委贯彻执行。在最近的两个月中，区委常委会就曾经五次讨论职工教育工作，召开了两次职工教育会议，作出了三个专门的文字指示。
    在基层单位的党组织和行政领导干部中，开始也有人看不到生产和教育的互相促进作用，而片面强调教育和生产的矛盾。有的说：“现在生产任务已经很多了，还搞什么学习，太麻烦了！”有的说：“我一手抓生产，一手抓生活，哪里有第三只手抓教育？”多数人认为：教育是好事，等以后有空再说。区委根据这种情况在一次会议上，发动基层党支部书记、厂长和领导干部就党的教育方针进行了为时三天的专题鸣放辩论，使绝大多数人明确认识到社会主义的工厂一方面要制出新产品，一方面也要为国家培养技术干部和人才，认识到只有管生产同时管教育才是一个好厂长、好支部书记。这样，在全党上下把生产和学习拧成一股绳，大家都对职工教育重视起来。
    现在中共南开区委为了进一步加强党对职工教育的领导，又建立起一套比较完整的领导体制。在区里，由区委书记挂帅，由文教、工业、财贸、工会、妇联、共青团等部门共同组成领导核心，区委各部和区人民委员会各局都设专职管教育工作的副部长或副局长。大的工厂、公司党组织设立教育委员会，甚至车间也有支部副书记和车间副主任专管职工教育工作。这样，使全区职工教育工作，在区委统一领导下成为一个整体，从上到下，系统包干，层层负责，出现了崭新的局面。
      教育为生产服务
    “教育会不会影响生产？”这是许多生产部门所关心的问题。南开区以生产为中心开展职工教育，学习却成了推动生产的力量。
    各单位以生产为中心安排教学工作，采取了很多办法。对学习和生产时间的合理安排；在编写教材和课程讲授中联系本厂的生产实际和工人的生活实际。很多工厂这样编写出来的教材，既灵活生动又对工人有启发教育作用。北大染厂职工学校的语文课教师，把本厂工人李少山染硫化蓝布解决了磨白问题的先进事迹编成教材，工人受到很大启发，上完这堂课工人们立即学习李少山的榜样，提出了四十三件合理化建议。工人们反映说：“上这样的课真解决问题，又学了文化，也受到了教育”。
    许许多多的事实都证明了：学习和生产不是矛盾，而是互相推动的。从南开区全区来看，96.5％的人参加学习以后，生产不但没有受到影响，还超额完成了生产计划。工人们经过学习文化技术知识以后，技术革新、发明创造和提出的大量的合理化建议，更给生产带来了莫大的好处。国营某厂职工能入学的已全部入学，去年下半年在学习中参加技术革新运动，共提出建议六千一百多件，工厂党委会在总结职工业余学习时说：“把文化学习坚持下来，不但不会影响生产，还会推动生产。”据南开区委最近对十四个工厂所作的调查结果，办学一般的七个厂，1958年生产总值计划实际完成161％，而办学好的七个厂则完成195％。
      发动群众，依靠群众
    南开区过去多数是中小工厂和作坊，设备简陋，工人文化水平低，可是，越“穷”干劲越大，越“白”越要革命。在这种“一穷二白”的情况下，工人们迫切要求学习文化技术，改变面貌。随着去年的大跃进，这种要求就更为迫切了。
    南开区各级党组织正确地认识、了解群众的要求，并且依靠群众发动群众，首先是从思想上发动群众，通过宣传、教育、辩论，使群众从思想上正确认识学习的重要意义，把学习成为工人自觉的要求。工业系统在区委召开了工农教育工作会议以后，90％的工厂向职工作了传达，50％的工厂组织了群众进行鸣放辩论，有40％的工厂还进行了深入的小组讨论。工人们明确了学习文化技术知识的重大意义以后，就给职工教育的开展打下了思想基础。有的工厂工人在鸣放辩论中对领导干部不重视学习、忽视工人要求的就直接了当地提出批评。工厂领导干部接受了工人的批评，并向群众做了检查，迅速采取措施把职工教育抓起来。
    在群众发动起来以后，就要进一步依靠群众想办法，解决教室、设备、教师等问题。南开区大部分单位办学校的困难问题都是这样解决的。由十二个小工厂和手工业生产合作社联合举办的卫星联合厂校就是群策群力办起来的，群众一齐动手自建了两间厂校办公室，借用了附近小学校的教室上课，各单位又主动想办法从职工中抽调出了十三名专职教师，五天中就把学校办起来了，参加学习的有一千二百多人，青壮年职工全部都入了学。
    在解决师资问题上，南开区许多职工学校也通过群众路线的办法，由工人保荐推举了一批政治质量好具有教学条件的工人，加以培养训练，担任教师。职工学校组成的校务委员会有工人代表参加，在学校工作中起重大作用。在学校下面由工人组成班级委员会和学习小组等组织，在学员中间开展活动，维持学习秩序，进行学习互助，帮助解决学习中的困难，保证学习出勤率的提高。
    妥善安排，保证出勤
    妥善地安排职工的学习、生产和生活，这是保证入学、出勤，保证职工能够经常坚持学习的一个重要关键。
    南开区二百多所职工学校的出勤率平均达到80％以上，主要原因是党委对职工的生产、生活和学习作了全面的安排。区委作出了专门的决定，在各个时期对基层单位职工学习出勤率进行检查。有关各系统根据本身情况具体地妥善安排了学习、生产和生活。在工厂中为了保证职工的学习，合理地调整了劳动组织，重新安排了各种会议、社会活动等时间，在正常情况下一般不占用学习时间。对于职工学校上课时间的改变，都规定了一定的请示报告和批准手续。遇到必须占用学习时间的特殊情况时，一般都规定了补课的办法，保证学习不间断。
    商业系统的职工业余学校在区委财贸部的领导下，组织九个行业和六百多个门市部、商店、手工业社职工，按不同情况的单位进行讨论，并且到商店做具体的调查分析，根据商业职工特殊的忙闲规律，分别妥善地安排学习时间，每天规定三种学习时间，职工可以根据自己的情况挑选，参加学习。白天忙的，晚上学习；上午忙的，下午学习；晚上忙的，白天抽时间学习。全天忙的职工就分三班轮流参加学习，共有七千多人入学。这样试行的结果，既保证了学习，又不影响业务和职工的正常休息。使学员的出勤率经常保持在90％以上。
    最近，中共南开区委对全区职工教育工作进行了一次检查，检查了一百多个工厂、商店、生产合作社等的职工教育工作进展情况。据六十一个工厂的调查结果，凡是安排得好的工厂出勤率都很高，例如有一个工厂达到百分之百。有九个工厂达到90％以上，只有十多个工厂的学习出勤率在60％以下。这些工厂出勤率低的原因主要是由于没有妥善安排和解决职工学习中的困难问题。例如卫星地毯厂业余学校女工学员很多，因为女工托儿问题没解决，学习出勤率一般只有60％多，经过检查以后，帮助工厂研究腾出了房子、增加了保育员为女工解决了托儿问题，出勤率就上升到80％以上。
