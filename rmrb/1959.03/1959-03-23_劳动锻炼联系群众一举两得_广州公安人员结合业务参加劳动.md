Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 22nd: The Guangzhou Public Security Department has implemented a system of "combining work with labor" for all public security personnel, achieving good results. It not only allows public security personnel to participate in labor training but also further strengthens ties with the masses, thereby strengthening public security work.

The scope of Guangzhou's public security personnel's participation in labor is very broad. Some work alongside staff at stations and docks, selling tickets or carrying luggage; others help factory and store employees move raw materials, clean warehouses, and sell goods. Through labor, they strengthen their ties with the masses and enhance public security. Many fire police officers go to key fire prevention units, such as chemical plants, steel mills, and canteens, to participate in labor, conducting fire prevention education while working, and promptly identifying and solving problems.

Through participation in labor, public security personnel have been educated, further establishing the concept of serving the masses and serving production. They have also discovered and resolved some issues related to their own work, promoting their own work. Members of the Southern District Fire Brigade participated in labor at the Guangzhou People's Paper Mill and discovered that the vehicles around the factory could not move smoothly and that there was a lack of fire water sources, making rescue difficult in the event of a fire. They immediately organized police officers to repair it and solved the fire water source problem. Later, a fire coincidentally broke out here, and because fire prevention work had been done in advance, the fire was quickly extinguished. The Northern District Traffic Police Team, through participation in labor, discovered that there were subjective shortcomings in some past work. After overcoming these shortcomings, the traffic management work was greatly improved.

Currently, the Guangzhou Public Security Department has established this practice as a regular system and plans to have its subordinate units connect with relevant production units in light of their own work, so as to organize public security personnel to participate in labor regularly and in batches.

    劳动锻炼联系群众一举两得
    广州公安人员结合业务参加劳动
    新华社广州22日电　广州市公安部门在全体公安人员中实行“结合业务参加劳动”的制度，取得了良好效果。既可以使公安人员参加劳动锻炼，又可以进一步密切联系群众，从而加强公安工作。
    广州市公安人员结合业务参加劳动的范围很广泛。有的和车站、码头职工一道售票或搬运行李，有的帮助工厂、商店职工搬运原材料、清理仓库、售货等，通过劳动加强同群众的联系，加强治安保卫工作。许多消防民警到消防的重点单位化工厂、炼钢厂、食堂去参加劳动，一面劳动一面进行消防宣传，并及时发现和解决问题。
    公安人员通过参加劳动受到了教育，从而进一步树立了为群众服务、为生产服务的观点，并发现和解决了与本身业务工作有关的一些问题，推动了本身业务工作。南区消防队队员们到广州人民造纸厂参加劳动，发现这个厂周围车辆不能畅通，又缺乏消防水源，如发生火警就很难抢救。他们便立即组织民警进行抢修，并解决了消防水源问题。后来这里凑巧发生了一次火警，由于事前做好了消防工作，火就很快被扑灭了。北区交通民警队通过参加劳动，发现过去某些工作中存在着主观主义的缺点，克服了这些缺点以后，就使交通管理工作得到了很大改进。
    目前，广州市公安部门已把这种做法定为一种经常性的制度，并计划由所属各单位分别结合本身业务，同有关生产单位取得联系，以便有计划地经常地组织公安人员定期分批去参加劳动。
