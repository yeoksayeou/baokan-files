Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch from Cape Canaveral: After four failures, the United States launched a small cosmos rocket, "Pioneer IV," on the 3rd. Due to deviations in its orbit and a slower-than-expected flight speed after launch, it passed the moon at a distance of 37,000 miles at 2:00 PM on the 4th, four hours later than scheduled. This distance was more than 10,000 miles greater than planned. It is currently continuing to move forward. It is said that this rocket will enter an orbit around the sun on the 17th.

Compared to the giant cosmos rocket launched by the Soviet Union more than two months ago, this small cosmos rocket is insignificant. Its head weighs only five kilograms, about one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of the weight of the corresponding part of the Soviet cosmos rocket. It carries a radio transmitter and two Geiger counters.

After the rocket was launched, some places in the United States and Britain received radio signals from it. British scientist Lovell said after receiving the signal that the signal from this rocket was unclear and jumpy, indicating that the United States was not as advanced as the Soviet Union in rocket launching and control technology.

Due to a series of shortcomings that have occurred with this rocket, several planned scientific exploration projects have not been realized.

The pair of auxiliary photocells installed on the rocket could only function by moonlight when it reached 20,000 miles from the moon. Now that the distance has exceeded 20,000 miles, the photocells cannot function, and the signal that was supposed to be sent when the rocket reached its closest point to the moon has not been sent. The intensity of moonlight was not recorded. At the same time, the exploration instruments for the moon's radiation belt have also lost their function. Materials related to whether the moon has a magnetic field are also unavailable.

### 美国发射小宇宙火箭  头部只有五公斤多重

    美国发射小宇宙火箭
    头部只有五公斤多重
    新华社6日讯　卡纳维拉尔角消息：美国经过四次失败后，在3日发射了一个小宇宙火箭“先驱者四号”。由于发射后轨道发生了偏差和飞行速度比预定的慢，它在4日下午二时，比预定的时间晚四个小时，在离月球三万七千英里处飞过了月球，这个距离比预定的要大一万多英里。目前它正在继续前进。据说，这个火箭将在17日进入围绕太阳运行的轨道。
    这个小宇宙火箭和苏联在两个多月以前发射的巨型宇宙火箭比较起来，是微不足道的。它的头部只有五公斤多重，相当于苏联宇宙火箭相应部分重量的约二百五十分之一。它携带的仪器是一架无线电发射机和两架盖氏计数器。
    火箭发出后，美国和英国一些地方已经收到它发出的无线电讯号。英国科学家拉佛尔在收到讯号后说，这个火箭上的讯号跳动不清，有很多迹象表明，美国在火箭的发射和控制技术方面都不及苏联。
    由于这个火箭已经发生了一系列的缺点，好几个预定的科学考察项目未能实现。
    火箭上装置的一对辅助光电池只能到达离月球二万英里处才能借月光发生作用。现在，距离既然超过了二万英里，光电池不能发生作用，预定的当火箭到达近月点时将发的讯号，未能发出。月光的强度未能记录下来。同时，月球辐射带的考察仪器也失去了作用。有关月球磁场是否存在的材料也无法得到。
