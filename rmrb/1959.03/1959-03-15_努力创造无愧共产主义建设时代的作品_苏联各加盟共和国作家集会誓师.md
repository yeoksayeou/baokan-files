Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: According to Soviet press reports, the writers' representative conferences of the Soviet republics have been held successively recently to discuss how literature and art can serve the comprehensive development of communist construction, serve the smooth completion of the Seven-Year Plan, and how to further promote the prosperity of Soviet literature.

These meetings were held around the time of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In addition to the founding assembly of the Writers' Union of the Russian Federation, Georgia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, and Tajikistan have also held writers' representative conferences. Other republics will follow suit. These conferences prepared for the upcoming Third All-Union Writers' Congress.

The republic's writers' representative conferences were held in the midst of the Soviet people's high tide of political and labor enthusiasm for marching towards communism, and as the Soviet Union is beginning to implement the Seven-Year Plan. Therefore, the local representative conferences focused on studying major issues such as how literature can fully reflect reality, reflect the construction enthusiasm of the Soviet people, and inspire the people under the new situation. At the local representative conferences, the speakers pointed out that for Soviet writers, never before have such glorious and arduous tasks been put before literature as they are now.

The republic's representative conferences pointed out the achievements made by Soviet literature in recent years and listed the names of many excellent works. The representative conferences also pointed out the failure of the imperialists and revisionists to attack Soviet literature and the creative methods of socialist realism after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

These representative conferences discussed issues such as strengthening the creation of modern themes, improving the ideological content of works, strengthening writers' ties with the masses, understanding actual life, and strengthening writers' learning. At the Georgian representative conference, writers generally expressed their determination to respond to the Party's call with facts and create works worthy of the era of communist construction. Writers believe that living with the masses is the only way to create excellent works. At the Armenian Writers' Representative Conference, various aspects of the issue of writers' connection with people's lives were elaborated. At the local representative conferences, special attention was also paid to the training of young writers and the strengthening of writers' learning. The writers' representative conferences also discussed how to improve literary skills and artistic level. This issue will be one of the central issues in Soviet literature in the future.

The local representative conferences made strict criticisms of individual bad works, and also raised opinions on the phenomenon that the creation of drama and poetry could not meet the needs of the masses.

The Party Central Committees of the republics attached great importance to and cared about the local writers' representative conferences. The First Secretaries of the Party Central Committee mostly spoke at the representative conferences. Their speeches greatly encouraged the writers. The writers expressed one after another that they would create more and better works in the great era of communist construction.

    努力创造无愧共产主义建设时代的作品
    苏联各加盟共和国作家集会誓师
    新华社莫斯科14日电　据苏联报刊报道，苏联各加盟共和国最近先后召开了作家代表大会，讨论文学艺术如何为全面开展共产主义建设服务，为顺利完成七年计划服务以及如何进一步繁荣苏维埃文学等问题。
    这些会议是在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会前后举行的。除俄罗斯联邦作家协会成立大会外，到目前为止还有格鲁吉亚、立陶宛、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚和塔吉克等共和国召开了作家代表大会。其他一些共和国也将陆续举行。这些大会为即将召开的全苏第三次作家代表大会作了准备工作。
    共和国的作家代表大会是在苏联人民向共产主义进军的政治劳动热情高涨中、在苏联正在开始实现七年计划的情况下召开的。因而各地代表大会都着重研究了在新形势下，文学如何充分反映现实，反映苏联人民的建设热情和鼓舞人民等重大问题。在各地代表大会上，发言的作家们都指出，对于苏联作家来说，还从来没有在文学面前提出过像现在这样光荣这样艰巨的任务。
    各共和国代表大会都指出苏联文学在最近几年来所取得的成就，并列举出许多优秀作品的名字。代表大会还指出苏共第二十次代表大会后，帝国主义者和修正主义者进攻苏联文学和社会主义现实主义的创作方法方面所遭到的失败。
    这些代表大会曾对加强现代题材的创作，提高作品的思想性，加强作家对群众的联系，对实际生活的了解，加强作家的学习等问题进行讨论。在格鲁吉亚代表大会上，作家们普遍表示决心，要用事实来回答党的号召，创造出无愧于共产主义建设时代的作品。作家们认为和群众生活在一起才能创造出优秀的作品。亚美尼亚作家代表大会上，对作家和人民生活联系的问题，作了多方面的阐述。在各地的代表大会上，还特别注意到培养青年作家和作家加强学习的问题。作家代表大会还讨论了如何提高文学的技巧和艺术水平问题。这个问题将是今后苏联文学中的中心问题之一。
    各地代表大会曾对个别坏作品提出严格的批评，对戏剧、诗歌等创作不能满足群众要求的现象也提出意见。
    各共和国党中央委员会对各地作家代表大会十分重视和关怀。党中央第一书记大都在代表大会上讲了话。他们的讲话给作家们以极大的鼓舞。作家们纷纷表示，要在共产主义建设的伟大时代，创造出更多更好的作品。
