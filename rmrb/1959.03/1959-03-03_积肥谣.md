Fertilizer Accumulation Rhyme
If people are diligent, the land won't be lazy; with plenty of manure, high yields are guaranteed.
Transform household soil into field soil; one mu will be worth two.
Everyone should carry manure baskets; each basket of manure will bring a斗 of grain.
Send thousands of cartloads of manure to the fields before spring; in the autumn, a harvest of ten thousand piculs of grain is assured.

    积肥谣人勤地不懒，粪多准高产。家土变野土，一亩顶二亩。人人都来背粪筐，一筐粪肥一斗粮，春前送地千车粪，秋后定收万石粮。
