Under the leadership of the Party and after the People's Commune movement, the garden-style farming method inherent in the Chinese working people has achieved considerable development.

This year, more than 700,000 mu of wheat planting area in Changge County, Henan Province, has all achieved field plot cultivation. This has laid a good foundation for Changge County's great agricultural harvest in 1959. It should be said that field plot cultivation is one of the revolutionary measures in agricultural cultivation.

What are the advantages of field plot cultivation? According to our initial experience, there are the following three points:

	(1) Deep plowing and intensive cultivation have changed the old extensive farming practices. Land is leveled according to different terrains. On the basis of deep plowing and the application of large amounts of organic fertilizer, three plowings and five harrows are carried out to crush soil clods and create raised beds for planting. There are walkways and ditches between the beds. The length and width of the beds are determined according to the specific conditions of each place. In some places, the width is one meter, the length is five meters, the bottom width of the bed ridge is 24 cm, the top width is 9 cm, and the height is 21 cm. The bed ridges are very straight, and wheat is planted on the ridges, achieving full planting without missing seedlings. When planting wheat, the beds are repeatedly leveled and raked evenly with fine-toothed small iron rakes, leaving no large soil clods. The amount of seeds and the depth of sowing are consistent, so that the seedlings can emerge neatly. These measures have changed the original wide rows and large ridges, large clods, squeezing of wheat seedlings, and the inability to achieve high-density planting. Field plot cultivation absorbs the rich experience of Chinese farmers in planting vegetable gardens and has created many new contents. For example, Dongcun in Changge County has developed management methods such as lodging-resistant wheat bed cultivation, irrigation gate control, frost-prevention tunnel chimneys, and management archives. Field plot cultivation plans farmland neatly and systematically, truly achieving "cultivation like embroidery," which is a powerful guarantee for harvesting more with less planting.

	(2) Even watering. After field plot cultivation, the area of the beds is roughly the same, and fertilization and watering can be uniform and consistent. At the same time, it can improve the efficiency of watering, and the utilization rate of water is also greatly improved. Similarly, it is easy to achieve uniform fertilization.

	(3) Turning bad land into good land. Field plot cultivation requires deep plowing of the land, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and watering well. The close combination of these three can integrate soil, fertilizer, and water, promote soil fertility, and turn dead soil into living soil, and living soil into fertile soil. For originally excessively sticky or sandy soil, after deep plowing and the application of organic fertilizer, the water storage and fertilizer retention capacity of these soils can be increased.

    对园田化优点的初步体会
    在党的领导下，在人民公社化运动以后，我国劳动人民所固有的土地园田种植法，得到了长足的发展。
    今年河南长葛县七十多万亩小麦种植面积，全部达到了园田化。这给长葛县1959年农业大丰收打下良好的基础。应该说，园田化是农业耕作上的革命性措施之一。
    园田种植法究竟有哪些好处？据我们的初步体会有以下三点：
      （一）深耕细作改变了旧时的耕作粗放的面貌。按照不同的地形平整土地，在深翻和大量施有机肥料的基础上，进行三犁五耙，粉碎土块，做畦种植。畦间有走道和水沟。畦的长宽，根据各地的具体条件决定。有的地方宽一公尺，长五公尺，畦埂底宽二十四公分，顶宽九公分，高二十一公分，畦埂很直，埂上种植小麦，达到寸土不缺苗。当种小麦的时候，在畦里多次用细齿小铁耙进行平整耙匀，没有大土块。播种量、播种深度做到一致，出苗才能整齐。这些措施改变了原来的宽行大垅，圪垃大，挤压麦苗，不能够高度密植等等缺点。园田化是吸取我国农民种菜园地的丰富经验，又创造了许多新的内容。如长葛县董村防止倒伏麦床化、灌水闸门化、防霜地道烟囱化、管理档案化等管理方法。园田化把耕地规划整齐，有条有理，真正作到“耕作如绣花”，是多收少种的有力的保证。
      （二）水浇匀。园田化以后，畦的面积都大致相同，施肥和浇水能达到均匀一致，同时可以提高浇水的工效，水的利用率也大大提高。同样地，在施肥上也容易做到均匀。
      （三）坏地变好地。园田化要求深翻土地，施足底肥，再加上浇好水，三者紧密地结合起来，能使土壤、肥、水三者相融，促进土壤肥沃，使死土变为活土，活土变为油土。对于原来过粘、过沙的土地，经深翻以后，施上有机肥料，可以增加这些土壤蓄水保肥的能力。
