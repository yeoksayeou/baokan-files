Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 27th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council has called for April 15 to be designated as "Africa Freedom Day." In a letter to the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of various countries, published in newspapers here today, the Secretariat stated that this call was put forward by the All-African People's Conference held in Accra, and it is of paramount importance that the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of various countries fully cooperate to make this day a great success.

The Secretariat recalled the call to designate December 1, 1958, as "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day," and said that the activities of that day had achieved great success.

The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council pointed out that the purpose of holding "Africa Freedom Day" is the same, and therefore "Africa Freedom Day" should be held with the same great enthusiasm as "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day." On this day, marches and mass rallies should be held, and resolutions should be passed at mass rallies demanding that all African countries be granted immediate freedom.

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处发出号召
    要求在四月十五日举行“非洲自由日”
    新华社开罗27日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处号召把4月15日定为“非洲自由日”。书记处今天在这里的报纸上发表的给各国亚非团结委员会的信中说，这个号召是由在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会提出来的，各国亚非团结委员会给予充分合作来使这一天取得伟大的成就具有极重大的意义。
    书记处追述了把1958年12月1日定为“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，并且说，这一天的活动曾经获得了巨大的成功。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处指出，举行“非洲自由日”的目的也是如此，因此应当像举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”那样，以极大的热情来举行“非洲自由日”。在这一天，应当举行游行和群众大会，应当在群众大会上通过决议要求立即给予所有的非洲国家以自由。
