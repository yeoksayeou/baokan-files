We have been away from the Dongfeng People's Commune for several days, but everything there is still deeply imprinted in our hearts. In that area north of the Daqing Mountains and south of the Yellow River, we saw such inspiring scenes of prosperity! Rows of low, wide glass houses, more than 420 rooms, were the commune's vegetable greenhouses. In the cold season, the rooms were filled with lush green vegetables. The commune owns three large trucks and more than 200 rubber-wheeled carts. This transportation brigade, spread out in a mighty array on the road, was constantly racing back and forth, some transporting fertilizer, others delivering vegetables, meat, and eggs to Baotou City and the factories and mines. Workers in the iron and wood factory were busy making more iron carts, wooden carts, and new farm tools for their own commune. On the fertile pastures, more than 10,000 cattle and sheep were grazing. From the two dairy farms, a large amount of fresh milk was supplied to the city every day. The commune has eight pig farms, as well as chicken farms, fish farms, forest farms, stone quarries, iron smelting plants, fertilizer plants... Everywhere is full of vitality, and all production is arranged in an orderly manner.

Clearly, the people's commune has opened up a brand-new path of life for the peasants. Now they not only have land and production tools, and no worries about food and clothing, but also an immense family fortune. In order to jointly manage this fortune, everyone's special skills and talents in the commune are beginning to be fully utilized, truly giving heroes a place to use their talents.

In the first farming area, there is a well-known "Seven Sisters" vegetable processing factory, founded by seven women who have been engaged in household chores for many years. The oldest of them had spent thirty years of her life next to small stoves, but the commune liberated them from household labor. When these seven women heard that the commune was letting them set up a factory to pickle leftover small melons and vegetables, they were overjoyed. When the commune didn't have enough funds, they launched a publicity campaign to mobilize women to invest, with ten yuan from you and twenty yuan from her, quickly raising more than 1,600 yuan. In the beginning, the factory had nothing, relying entirely on their own ideas. Without stone slabs to press the vegetables, the Seven Sisters went to the river to carry them back one by one. They skillfully sorted, washed, peeled, cut, and pickled a total of 179 large vats of cucumbers, green beans, radishes, and peppers, and also made two large vats of tomato sauce, which soon earned them more than 6,000 yuan. Pickling vegetables is a skill that housewives are best at. In winter, which farm family doesn't store a few small jars of pickles? Now, they have used their expertise to set up this factory, producing thousands of pounds of delicious pickles to meet the needs of the city and create wealth for the people's commune.

In another vegetable processing and brewing factory in the people's commune, we met Master Chen Jian, a vinegar maker. He was working intently in the steamy vinegar-making workshop, stripped to the waist. A woman was walking around him, his wife, who was also a capable assistant. When they were working independently, they would occasionally make some vinegar as a household sideline production, selling it by the half-jin or a few liang to supplement their household income. After joining the agricultural cooperative, he gave up this small skill. Now, in the factory run by the people's commune, Chen Jian and his wife have become respected technicians, specializing in vinegar making, producing hundreds of pounds of finished products every day, and they are also preparing to take on apprentices to expand production.

Like Chen Jian, there are many people who are valued in every farming area. In the people's commune, no matter what skills you have, you will not be buried. On the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery fronts, people are working happily and utilizing their intelligence and talents.

Yun Dalai, a seventy-year-old Mongolian grandfather from Ashangoumen Village, particularly caught our attention. This old grandfather always smiled so brightly. His frank words made us understand why he lived such a happy life as a member of the people's commune. He grew up among cattle and sheep, grazing outdoors in the wind and rain all his life. As soon as the people's commune was established, the old grandfather valued all his cattle and sheep and gave them to the commune. After discussion, the commune cadres decided to leave him a dairy cow, and also left him a donkey so that the old grandfather could ride it when he went out. Considering his age, the commune did not let him graze outside anymore, but assigned him to be a lamb protector. This kind of cordial care and consideration deeply moved the old grandfather. He felt that no matter how capable he was in the past, he only grazed more than 200 cattle and sheep, but now? What a great family fortune! He can use his sixty years of experience in raising livestock to care for lambs and allow the commune's animal husbandry to develop as quickly as possible. He smiled naively and said to us in Chinese: "I, Yun Dalai, have a little 'art' (skill) that is neither high nor low, and I must show my 'art' in the commune!" The commune has already transferred two capable cadres, Deputy Company Commander Kang Zhangyuan and militia platoon leader Zhang Quwang, to learn the techniques of livestock protection and lamb rearing from Yun Dalai. How could Yun Dalai not smile happily all day long? He understood that only by establishing the people's commune could his valuable experience accumulated through a lifetime of hard work be better respected and better passed on to future generations.

When we visited the dairy farm in the fourth farming area, Wang Wenyi, the Hui deputy director of the farm, was in the cattle shed. He held up a shiny calf in both hands and said gently: "Stand up quickly, let the guests see how beautiful you are!" As the weather was getting cold, he quickly took his son and nephew to find wood and pull adobe bricks, and built eight cattle sheds and three milking rooms himself. The rooms were also equipped with stoves and electric lights. Wang Wenyi is a worker with great ambitions. Not long after talking with us, he enthusiastically promoted the dairy farm's five-year plan: 500 heads by 1960, more than 800 heads by 1961... He said: "We must have a long-term vision. Baotou City needs milk, factories and mines need milk, the commune's children need to drink milk, and in the future, the commune members must also improve their diet. We must quickly make a big splash in this production." This energetic Hui old man, after the establishment of the people's commune, not only brought his original ten dairy cows into the commune's dairy farm, but also specially bought a Dutch breeding bull from outside and valued it into the commune. With his rich breeding experience and talent, he is doing his best to run the commune's dairy farm well.

This situation in the people's commune, where everyone is doing their best and all undertakings are thriving, inspires people's great ambitions. People with short-sightedness and who are concerned about personal gains and losses are slowly changing, and a group of advanced producers with lofty ideals and a love for collective undertakings have emerged in every production team. Their talents are being fully developed and improved. In this sense, the people's commune is truly a vast and complex school for cultivating talent!

    管好万贯家业
    本报记者　赵永西、程竞明
    离开东风人民公社好几天了，那里的一切还深深印在我们的心里。在那北依大青山、南临黄河的地带，我们曾经看到了多么激动人心的繁荣景象！一排排矮而宽的玻璃房子，有四百二十多间，那是公社的蔬菜温室。在严寒的季节里，满室蔬菜显得青翠欲滴。公社拥有三部大汽车和二百多辆胶皮轮马车。这支运输大队在路上摆开了浩浩荡荡的阵势，不停地奔驰着，有的运肥料，有的向包头市和厂矿送蔬菜和肉食蛋品。铁木工厂的工人正在为自己公社赶制更多的铁车、木车和新农具。在肥美的牧场上，放牧着一万多头牛羊。从两座牛奶场中，每天有大量鲜奶供应城市。公社有八个养猪场，还有鸡场、渔场、林场、采石厂、炼铁厂、化肥厂……。到处生气蓬勃，各项生产安排得井然有序。
    很显然，人民公社化为农民们开拓了一条崭新的生活道路。他们现在不仅仅有土地、有生产工具，吃穿不愁，而且有了万贯家业。为了共同管好这份家业，公社里每个人的特长和才能，都开始充分地施展出来了，真是英雄有用武之地。
    在第一耕作区，有座名气不小的“七姊妹”蔬菜加工厂，这是由七个长年从事家务劳动的妇女创办的。她们中间年纪最大的，在小锅小灶旁边消磨了三十年的岁月，公社化把她们从家务劳动中解放出来。当这七位妇女听说社里让她们办个工厂，利用卖不掉的小瓜、蔬菜腌制咸菜时，心里乐开了花。社里资金不够，她们便开展宣传，发动妇女投资，你十元、她二十元很快凑了一千六百多元。一开始建厂要啥没啥，全靠自己想法子。没有压菜的石板，七姊妹就到河里一块一块往回搬。她们熟练地剔、洗、剥、切、腌，一共腌了一百七十九口大缸的黄瓜、豆角、萝卜、辣椒，还制出两大缸西红柿酱，过了不久便收入六千多元。腌咸菜，本是家庭妇女最拿手的活儿。到冬天，那一户农家不存上几小瓮腌菜？如今她们以自己的擅长办起了这座工厂，制出成千上万斤味美的咸菜，供应城市的需要，为人民公社创造了财富。
    在人民公社另一座蔬菜加工酿造厂中，我们认识了制醋的老师傅陈间。他光着膀子，在热气腾腾的制醋车间专心工作着。有个妇女在一旁转来转去，这是他的老婆，也是得力的助手。在单干的时候，他们夫妻俩就不时捎带着制点醋，当作家庭副业生产，半斤、几两的卖出去，贴补家用。参加农业社以后，他这点小手艺也扔了。现在，在人民公社办的工厂里，陈间夫妻成了受人注目的技术员，专门负责制醋，每天要生产几百斤成品，还准备收徒工扩大生产。
    像陈间这样受重视的人，各个耕作区还有很多。在人民公社里，不论你有一点儿什么本领，都不会被埋没。在农、林、牧、副、渔各条战线上，人们安心愉快地工作着发挥各自的聪明与才干。
    阿善沟门村有个七十多岁的蒙古族老爷爷，名叫云达赖，特别引起了我们的注意。这位老爷爷总是笑得那么开朗。他的坦率的言谈，让我们懂得：作为一个人民公社的社员，为什么生活得这样快乐。他从小是在牛羊群中长大的，一辈子风里来、雨里去地在外放牧。人民公社一成立，老爷爷把牛羊统统作价归了社。社干部们一商议，决定留给他一头奶牛，还留下毛驴，好让老爷爷出门时骑用。社里考虑到他的年纪大了，不让他再到外边放牧，分配他当个保羔员。这种亲切的关怀和照顾，使老爷爷十分感动。他觉得自己过去再能干，也不过放牧两百多头牛羊，现在呢？好一份大家业！他可以用六十年饲养牲畜的经验来保育羊羔，让公社畜牧事业尽快地发展起来。他天真地笑着，用汉话对我们说：“我云达赖，多少有点‘艺术’（技术）不高、也不低，在公社里我一定得把
  ‘艺术’露一露！”公社已经抽调了两个得力干部，副连长康张元和基干排长张蛆旺，来向云达赖学习保畜育羔的技术。云达赖怎能不整天乐呵呵的笑呢？他懂得只有办起人民公社，自己一生历尽辛苦所积累下的宝贵经验，才更加受到应有的尊重，才更好地传之于后代。
    当我们参观第四耕作区的牛奶场时，回族副场长王文义正在牛房里。他双手抱起了一只油光光的小牛犊，温和地说道：“快站起来，让客人们来看看，瞧你长的多好看！”天快冷了，他就赶忙带着儿子、侄儿找木料、拉土坯，自己搭盖起八间牛棚和三间挤奶房，房里还装上火炉、安了电灯。王文义是个有着雄心大志的劳动者，他与我们交谈不久，便饶有兴味地宣传了牛奶场的五年计划：1960年发展到五百头，1961年八百多头……。他说：“我们眼光要看得远，包头市需要牛奶，工厂矿山需要牛奶，公社的娃娃们要喝奶，以后社员也得改善饮食，我们这门生产一定要赶快大大闹一番。”这个精干的回族老人，在人民公社成立以后，不仅带着自己原有的十头乳牛进了公社牛奶场，还特地在外面买下一头荷兰公种牛作价入社。他以丰富的饲养经验和才干，在为办好公社牛奶场而尽心尽力。
    人民公社这种各尽所能、各项事业蒸蒸日上的局面，激发着人们的雄心壮志。眼光短浅、斤斤计较个人得失的人，正在慢慢改变，各个生产队都出现了一批有远大理想、热爱集体事业的先进生产者。他们的才能，正在得到充分地发挥和提高。从这个意义上来说，人民公社真是一所庞大而复杂的培养人才的学校！
