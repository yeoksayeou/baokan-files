The aesthetic resides in the nature of things that enhance the perfection of life. Oil buried in the stratum, only when it transforms into fuel and leaps into flames, does it reveal its brilliance. Water flowing in a river ditch, only when it gathers into a lake of shimmering blue waves before a dam, and plunges from a gate as a silver waterfall of dozens of feet, does it reveal its beauty and magnificence!

Within these flames, blue waves, and silver waterfalls, shines the creative labor of man. Only this in the world is fundamental to enhancing the perfection of life; only this in humanity is the nature that distinguishes man from all other living things.

Therefore, among all things, the most beautiful is the laboring man; on man, the most beautiful is creative labor. In our lives, the greater one's creative labor, the more beautiful one is; and the most beautiful is the one who does the greatest creative labor.

Interest and Aspiration

If you ask what my interest is? Literature and art? Science? ... I cannot clearly answer such questions. Because my entire interest is revolution.

If you ask what my aspiration is? To be a writer? To be a researcher? ... I cannot fully answer. Because my lifelong aspiration is to realize the Party's program.

A Communist Party member, only when all his interests lie in the revolution, whether in literature and art, in science... will he have the greatest interest; because this interest is fused with a noble mission.

A Communist Party member, only when he takes the realization of the Party's program as his lifelong aspiration, whether engaged in literature and art, engaged in science..., he must and will inevitably become an expert in what he does; because this itself is a task assigned to him by the Party.

Writers, scientists, and other workers of all kinds, as a member of the Party, must remember: everything for the revolution, everything for the realization of the Party's program!

    人的美学（外一章）
    吕林
    美，依存于能增进生活完善的事物的本性。石油埋在地层下，当它化为燃料而腾跃起朵朵火焰，才显出它的灿丽。水流在河沟里，当它在拦河坝前汇成碧波鳞鳞的湖海，而在闸门下飞出高激数丈的银瀑，也才显出它的秀丽和壮奇！
    在这火焰、碧波和银瀑里，闪亮着人的创造性的劳动。世界上唯有这，才是增进生活完善之根本；人类中唯有这，才是人的区别于一切生物的本性。
    因而，万物间，最美丽的是劳动着的人；人身上，最美丽的是创造性的劳动。在我们的生活里，谁的创造性劳动愈大，他就愈美丽；而最美丽的，是那作着最大的创造性劳动的人。
    兴趣与志愿
    若要问我的兴趣是什么？文艺？科学？……对这样的提问，我说不清。因为，我的全部兴趣是革命。
    若要问我的志愿是什么？当作家？做研究员？……我答不全。因为，我的终身志愿是实现党的纲领。
    共产党员，唯有全部兴趣在于革命，无论对文艺、对科学……才会有最大的兴趣；因为这兴趣中，溶和了崇高的使命。
    共产党员，唯有以实现党的纲领为自己终身志愿，无论从事文艺、从事科学……，他就必须也必然对自己所从事者成为专家；因为这本身就是党规定给他的任务。
    作家、科学家、其他不论何种工作者，作为党的一个成员，必须记住：一切为了革命，一切为了实现党的纲领！
