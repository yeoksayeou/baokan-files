Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: The spring struggle launched by the Japanese working class is continuing, with waves of strikes rising one after another.

    Thirteen unions in the Japanese private railway sector began a 24-hour strike at 11:00 AM today, insisting on wage increases. The union stated that if the management refuses to meet their demands, workers will hold another 24-hour strike on the 15th.

    To oppose capitalists’ mass layoffs under the guise of “enterprise rectification,” 28,000 workers from the Mitsui Mining Company began a 48-hour strike at 7:00 AM this morning. The employees of this large coal mining company also took consistent action with the workers today, launching a struggle to refuse overtime work.

    Prior to this, the workers of Mitsui Mining Company had held four unified strikes. The union has decided that the workers of this coal mine will hold a 48-hour strike on the 16th, a 72-hour strike on the 19th, and an indefinite strike from the 23rd, insisting on achieving their demands.

    The Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, which is demanding a wage increase of 2,000 yen, yesterday rejected the management's proposal to increase wages by 800 yen, and decided that its affiliated unions will hold strikes for one, two, three, five days, and indefinite strikes respectively from the 14th to the 19th. The All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union also decided yesterday to take strike action, refuse overtime, and other means from the 16th to the 20th, persisting in the struggle until final victory.

    The unions of public service departments such as national railways, post, and telecommunications have all decided yesterday to hold workplace rallies across the country on the 13th to demand wage increases.

    Kishi Nobusuke's government's Minister of Postal Services, Yutaka Terao, yesterday issued a "warning" to the All-Communication Employees Union, threatening the union to stop the scheduled workplace rallies to be held in 200 post offices across the country on the 13th. The Kumamoto City Post Office also issued a "warning" letter with the same content to the union yesterday. However, the threats from the government authorities did not intimidate the Japanese workers. The Kumamoto City Postal Workers' Union has decided to return the "warning" letter and continue the struggle.

    日本工人春季斗争继续开展
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本工人阶级发动的春季斗争正在继续开展，罢工浪潮此起彼伏。
    日本私营铁道部门的十三个工会从今天上午十一时开始举行二十四小时罢工，坚持要求提高工资。工会方面表示，如果资方不肯满足他们的要求，工人们将在15日再次举行二十四小时罢工。
    为了反对资本家以“整顿企业”为名大批解雇工人，三井矿山公司的二万八千名工人从今天早晨七时开始，举行了四十八小时罢工。这家大煤矿公司的职员今天也和工人采取一致行动，展开了拒绝加班的斗争。
    在这以前，三井矿山公司的工人曾经举行了四次统一的罢工。工会已经决定，这个煤矿公司的工人将在16日举行四十八小时、19日举行七十二小时的罢工，从23日举行不定期罢工，坚持要实现他们的要求。
    正在要求提高工资二千日元的日本钢铁产业工会联合会昨天拒绝了资方提出的增加工资八百日元的方案，并且决定从14日到19日由它所属的工会分别举行为时一天、两天、三天、五天和不定期的罢工。全日本造船工会昨天也决定从16日到20日采取罢工、拒绝加班等方式，把斗争坚持到最后胜利。
    国营铁道、邮政、电信等公用事业部门的工会昨天都分别决定，于13日在全国各地举行工作场所大会，要求增加工资。
    岸信介政府的邮政相寺尾丰昨天向全递信从业员工会提出“警告”，威胁工会停止预定13日在全国二百个邮局举行的工作场所大会。熊本市的邮政局昨天也向工会方面提出同样内容的“警告”书。但是，政府当局的威胁并没有吓住日本工人。熊本市的邮政工会已经决定退回“警告”书，继续进行斗争。
