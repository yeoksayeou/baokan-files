Editor's Note: This is an editorial from the Beijing Daily on March 11th. This editorial raises important questions about strengthening basic natural science theory courses. We agree with the editorial's views and are reprinting it here for everyone's attention.

How should we treat basic natural science theory courses? This question has sparked heated debate in universities. The core issues of the debate are: first, should basic courses be combined with majors and connected to practice? Second, should the original theoretical system of basic courses be preserved?

Some people do not agree with the approach of combining basic courses with majors and connecting them to practice. They believe: "Basic courses have their own independent system and do not need to be combined with majors"; "Combining with majors will weaken the systematic theory." Others advocate dismantling basic courses altogether, "breaking them into parts" and teaching them in professional courses, without preserving the original theoretical system of basic courses.

The fundamental key to solving this problem is to correctly handle the relationship between theory and practice.

In the past year, thanks to the implementation of the Party's educational policy, the bourgeois educational viewpoint that emphasizes abstract theory and is seriously divorced from reality has been greatly reduced. However, in the field of basic courses, this problem has not been completely resolved. Some people do not believe that combining with majors and connecting with practice can improve the teaching quality of basic theory. They have a kind of "special theory," believing that professional courses can be combined with production practice, while basic courses cannot. Forcing a combination will only result in a few practical examples in lectures. They oppose scientific theory and the scientific practical application, belittling practice and production. In their view, the so-called "scientific system theory" can be completely isolated from people's practical activities. This idea is clearly contrary to materialism.

The unity of theory and practice is the basic characteristic of Marxist epistemology. If we carefully study the history of the development of basic natural science theory, we can clearly see that the development of basic natural science theory, like the development of all theories, comes from practice, and is tested by practice to guide practice. For example, in ancient Egypt and Babylon, farming was closely related to river flooding, so astronomy was needed to calculate river flood seasons. This promoted the development of astronomy, which in turn promoted the development of mathematics, the necessary foundation of astronomy, and the need to measure fields led to the emergence of geometry. The emergence of mechanics was due to the construction of large buildings and complex water conservancy projects, as well as the needs of navigation and military affairs. The development of modern basic theory is also the same. Einstein completed the theory of special relativity because many experiments at the time had already proven that Newton's mechanics theory could not explain certain light phenomena, and a new theory was needed to replace it, and the objective conditions for forming a new theory were already in place. It can be seen that the reason why basic theory can continue to develop is precisely because it carefully listens to the calls of practical experience. Without practice, all scientific theories will become water without a source and a tree without roots, and will inevitably wither.

Today, an important issue in basic course teaching in universities is to correctly resolve the combination of theory and practice from the perspective of dialectical materialism. According to the experience already gained by some schools, the method of combination should be: ensuring and strengthening the training of the systematic theory of basic courses, and constantly improving the theoretical level; and also ensuring that basic courses are correctly combined with majors and correctly connected with production practice. Will connecting with practice weaken the scientific system theory? Facts have provided the best answer. In schools that have done so, the system theory has not been weakened, but has been strengthened. Because the production practice problems in majors are very rich, to analyze the actual problems clearly, or to solve the actual problems better, it is necessary to master more basic theoretical knowledge. After the basic courses are combined with majors, not only has the theoretical content of the basic courses not decreased, but it has been taught more and more thoroughly than in the past. At the same time, due to the continuous development of production, the combination of majors has given the basic courses an infinite source of knowledge, opening up a broad road for the continuous improvement of the teaching quality of basic courses.

When we emphasize the combination of basic courses with majors and the connection of theory with practice, we are by no means asking the basic courses to be changed into professional courses, using practice to replace theory. Belittling the role of theory is also contrary to Marxist epistemology. Now, some people, in the process of opposing theory's departure from practice, have more or less developed an idea of underestimating the significance of basic theory. They believe that since practice is the source of theory, only direct participation in practice and learning some knowledge directly related to the major are useful. The learning of basic theory seems to be not so important. Therefore, there are proposals to dismantle and weaken basic courses.

Now let's specifically analyze their thinking.

Their argument firstly separates the unity of theory and practice, and makes a one-sided understanding of the issue of knowledge. What is knowledge? The source of people's knowledge includes direct experience and indirect experience. It is correct that all knowledge ultimately originates from direct experience. However, as far as each person's cognitive process is concerned, not everything can be experienced personally. For example, air composition and chemical elements are not personally experimented on by everyone; our knowledge comes from the experiments of predecessors. There is also a part of scientific knowledge for which it is now impossible to obtain direct experience, such as past history. An important purpose of running schools is to scientifically concentrate historical experience and foreign experience, discarding the crude and selecting the essence, so that students can master them in a shorter period of time, which is conducive to expanding the field of knowledge and shortening the process of cognition. Therefore, in school education, we cannot underestimate direct experience, nor can we underestimate indirect experience. Of course, it should also be seen that not all theoretical knowledge in books is completely reliable. There are correct things, and there are errors. Therefore, our learning methods should not be dull reading and rote memorization, or swallowing things whole; we should be good at learning critically: correct things are our positive teaching materials, and erroneous things are our negative teaching materials. Positive teaching materials teach us correct knowledge, and negative teaching materials teach us how to judge fallacies, which can also train our ability to identify things. In short, when it comes to learning, we should have a comprehensive perspective. Direct and indirect experience, basic and professional knowledge, ancient and modern knowledge, Chinese and foreign knowledge, all useful knowledge, we should study seriously. Only emphasizing theory and not paying attention to practice, or valuing practice and belittling theory, are one-sided views. Those who advocate dismantling basic courses have this kind of one-sidedness. In fact, basic courses and professional courses are not fundamentally opposed. The setting up of basic courses in universities is to ensure that students develop their professional knowledge on a broad and systematic theoretical basis. Weakening basic courses will in turn affect the improvement of the quality of professional courses. The experience of some schools has proved that after strengthening basic courses and paying attention to combining with majors and connecting with practice, students' understanding of professional courses has become more in-depth.

Some people may say, we are not trying to weaken basic theory, but we advocate separating basic courses and spreading them to several professional courses. What's wrong with that? They did not see that basic courses are to impart general natural laws, through which students can have a comprehensive understanding of the entire material world. For example, the learning of physics courses is to enable students to systematically and comprehensively understand the basic laws of several important forms of material movement in nature, as well as the internal connections between these laws of motion. If you divide the physics course into several courses to learn, it will sever these connections, so that students only get fragmented knowledge. This makes it impossible to fully grasp the laws of nature, and through the entire development process of physics, to cultivate their dialectical materialist world outlook and thinking methods.

When dealing with the issue of basic theory, we cannot only see today, but also see tomorrow. At present, science and technology are developing rapidly, and the rich experience of production practice needs to be summarized and improved theoretically, while our theoretical work lags behind practice. We know that research on basic theory can promote the adoption of the latest scientific theories and new technologies in professions, opening up new avenues for production. Often there is some basic theoretical knowledge that does not have a direct driving effect on production today, but may be used in production practice tomorrow. Twenty years ago, nuclear physics was purely theoretical work, but today the scope of its influence is so broad! Some people cannot see these things, and one-sidedly emphasize "what the major needs at the moment is what is taught," which is a myopic view.

With the rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production, the research of basic theory will increasingly show its importance. Strengthening the teaching of basic natural science theory in universities is of great significance for cultivating construction talents adapted to the development of modern science and technology. In this regard, the basic course teachers in universities shoulder a glorious responsibility. We hope that they will resolutely get rid of the state of being divorced from production, divorced from reality, and lacking professional knowledge; go deep into reality, master the necessary professional knowledge, and improve the level of scientific theory. At the same time, they must gradually learn and master dialectical materialism, and implement the dialectical materialist viewpoint into the teaching of basic natural science theory courses. Only by following this path can we effectively and continuously improve the teaching work of basic natural science theory. Some schools have already made valuable efforts in these areas and achieved results. We believe that such a wave of learning will quickly rise in more universities, promoting the continuous strengthening of the basic course teachers and the teaching work of basic courses in universities.

    加强高等学校的自然科学基础理论教学
    ——北京日报三月十一日社论
    编者按：这是北京日报3月11日的一篇社论。这篇社论提出了关于加强自然科学基础理论课的重要问题，我们同意社论的意见，特转载于此，希大家注意。
    怎样对待自然科学的基础理论课程？这个问题，在高等学校里曾经引起过热烈的争论。争论的核心问题，一个是基础课要不要结合专业联系实际？一个是要不要保存基础课原来的理论系统？
    有的人不赞成基础课结合专业、联系实际的作法。他们认为：“基础课有自己的独立系统，不需要结合专业”；“结合专业会削弱系统理论”。也有的人则主张干脆拆散基础课，“化整为零”，并到专业课中去讲，不必保存基础课原来的理论系统。
    解决这个问题的根本关键，就是要正确地对待理论与实践的关系问题。
    这一年来，由于贯彻执行了党的教育方针，那种偏重抽象理论、严重脱离实际的资产阶级教育观点，已经大大减少了。但是在基础课的领域中，这个问题还没有彻底解决。有些人不相信结合专业联系实际能够提高基础理论的教学质量。他们有一种“特殊论”，认为专业课可以结合生产实际；基础课则无法结合。硬要结合，也只有在讲课中举上几个实际例子罢了。他们把科学的理论和科学的实际运用对立起来，轻视实践，轻视生产。在他们看来，所谓“科学的系统理论”，是可以同人们的实践活动完全隔绝开来的。这种想法显然是违反唯物论的。
    理论与实践的统一，是马克思主义认识论的基本特点。我们如果认真研究一下自然科学基础理论发展的历史，就可以清楚地看到：自然科学基础理论的发展，同一切理论的发展一样，是来自实践，又经过实践检验而指导实践的。例如，在古代埃及和巴比伦，进行耕作同河川泛滥有密切的联系，因此需要天文学来推算河流的汛期。这样，就促进了天文学的发展，天文学的发展又促进了天文学的必要基础的数学的发展，测量田亩的需要又引起几何学的产生。由于大建筑物和复杂水利工程的兴建，以及航海和军事的需要，就产生了力学。近代基础理论的发展也是如此。爱因斯坦完成了狭义相对论，是由于当时的许多实验，已经证明牛顿的力学理论无法解释某些光的现象，需要新理论来代替它，而且客观上也已经具备了形成新理论的条件。由此可见，基础理论之所以能够不断地发展，正是因为它仔细倾听了实践经验的呼声。离开了实践，一切科学理论就成为无源之水，无本之木，就一定会枯萎下去的。
    今天在高等学校基础课教学中的一个重要问题，就是以辩证唯物主义的观点正确地解决理论与实践的结合。根据一些学校已经取得的经验看来，结合的方法应当是：既保证并加强基础课的系统理论的训练，不断提高理论水平；又必须做到基础课正确地结合专业，正确地联系生产实践。联系实践会不会削弱科学的系统理论呢？事实作了最好的答复。在这样做了的学校里，系统理论不但没有削弱，而是更加加强了。因为专业里的生产实际问题是十分丰富的，要分析清楚实际问题，或者更好地解决实际问题，就需要掌握更多的基础理论知识。在基础课结合专业以后，不仅没有减少基础课的理论内容，反而比过去讲得更多、更透。同时，由于生产在不断发展，结合专业就使基础课获得了无穷的源泉，开辟了基础课教学质量不断提高的康庄大道。
    我们在强调基础课结合专业理论联系实践的时候，决不是要基础课改变成专业课，用实际去代替理论。贬低理论的作用，同样是违反了马克思主义的认识论。现在也有些人，在反对理论脱离实践的过程当中，或多或少地出现了一种对基础理论的意义估计不足的思想。他们认为：既然实践是理论的源泉，只有直接参加实践和学习一些与专业直接有关的知识才是有用的。基础理论的学习似乎就并不怎么重要了。因此就有拆散和削弱基础课的主张。
    现在我们来具体分析一下他们的这种想法。
    他们的主张，首先是割裂了理论与实践的统一，对知识问题做了片面的理解。什么是知识呢？人们知识的来源，有直接经验与间接经验，一切知识归根到底发源于直接经验，这是正确的。但是就每一个人的认识过程说，不能事事都经过亲身的实践。例如空气成分，化学元素，并不是人人都亲自做过试验的，我们的知识是来自前人的试验。还有一部分科学知识，现在已经无法取得直接经验，如过去的历史。办学校的一个重要目的，就是要把历史的经验和外域的经验，去粗取精，科学地集中起来，以便学生能在较短时期之内加以掌握，有利于扩大认识领域和缩短认识的过程。因此，在学校教育当中，既不能够轻视直接经验，也不能够轻视间接经验。当然，也应当看到一切书本上的理论知识，并不是完全可靠的。有正确，也有谬误。所以我们的学习方法，不能够呆读死记，生吞活剥；而应当善于批判地进行学习：正确的东西，是我们的正面教材，谬误的东西，是我们的反面教材。正面教材教给我们正确的知识，反面教材教给我们如何去判别谬误，同样可以锻炼我们的识别能力。总之，对待学习，应当有全面的观点，直接经验和间接经验，基础和专业，古代和现代，中国和外国，一切有用的知识，我们都应当认真学习。只偏重理论，不注意实践，或者重视了实践，又看轻了理论，都是片面的观点。主张拆散基础课的人，就有这样的片面性。其实，基础课和专业课，并不是根本对立的。高等学校设置基础课，就是要保证学生在广泛而系统的理论基础上发展他们的专业知识，削弱基础课的结果，也会反过来影响专业课质量的提高。一些学校的经验证明，在加强了基础课，并且注意了结合专业，联系实际以后，学生对专业课的理解也更为深入了。
    有人会说，我们不是要削弱基础理论，而是主张把基础课分开，分散到几门专业课中去讲，又有什么不好呢？他们没有看到，基础课是传授一般的自然规律的，通过它使学生对整个物质世界有一个全面的了解。例如物理课的学习，就是要使学生能系统地全面地了解自然界中若干种重要的物质运动形式的基本规律，以及这些运动规律之间的内在联系。如果把物理课分到几门课中去学，就会割裂了这些联系，使学生仅仅得到片断的知识。这就无法达到完整地掌握自然规律，和通过物理学的整个发展过程，培养他们辩证唯物主义世界观和思想方法的要求。
    在对待基础理论的问题上，我们不能只看到今天，还要看到明天。目前科学技术正在一日千里地发展，丰富的生产实践的经验，需要从理论上加以总结提高，而我们的理论工作是落后于实际的。我们知道，基础理论的研究，能够促进专业采用最新科学理论和新的技术，为生产开辟新的途径。往往有一些基础理论知识，在今天还看不到对生产的直接推动作用，明天就可能用于生产实际。二十年前，原子核物理是纯理论性的工作，而今天它所影响的范围竟是如此广阔！有些人看不到这些，片面地强调目前的“专业需要什么就讲什么”，这是一种近视的观点。
    随着我国工农业生产的飞跃发展，基础理论的研究将日益显出其重要性。加强高等学校的自然科学基础理论教学，对于培养适应于现代科学技术发展的建设人材，具有重要的意义。在这一方面，高等学校的基础课教师们担负着光荣的职责。希望他们坚决地摆脱掉脱离生产、脱离实际、缺乏专业知识的状态；深入实际，掌握必要的专业知识，提高科学理论水平。同时，还必须逐步学习和掌握辩证唯物主义，把辩证唯物主义观点贯彻到自然科学基础理论课程的教学中去。只有走这一条途径，才能够切实地不断改进自然科学基础理论的教学工作。有些学校已经在这些方面做出了可贵的努力，取得了效果。我们相信，这样的学习热潮将迅速地在更多的高等学校里掀起来，促进高等学校的基础课师资和基础课的教学工作不断加强。
