    Two Labors
    Wang Shouren, People's Court of Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province

    I experienced the following incident:

    The same twenty people, using the same tools, digging the same manure, but the first day's achievement was 40 cubic meters, and the second day it was over 100 cubic meters. What was the reason? Originally, it was mainly because the labor organization was improved: the first day there was no division of labor, everyone worked in a chaotic mob! The second day, groups were divided, tasks were assigned, and a competition was launched.

    Improving the labor organization and implementing the division of labor and task contracting will improve labor efficiency – this is undoubtedly a good leadership method. Because this method can evaluate people's labor, compare the advanced, the average, and the backward, and urge people to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and strive to be advanced.

    People all have a competitive spirit. Everyone wants to strive to be advanced, and no one likes to lag behind. Therefore, everyone is motivated and strives for the upstream – this is in line with the spirit of the General Line. From this, we can see how important it is to correctly establish labor organization and organize labor competition!

    两次劳动
    黑龙江省集贤县人民法院　王守仁
    我经历过这样一件事：
    同样是二十个人，用的同样的工具，挖的是同样的粪土，可是，第一天的成绩是四十方，第二天是一百多方。什么原因呢？原来主要是劳动组织改进了：第一天是没有分工、大家一窝蜂的干！第二天，划分了小组，分配了任务，展开了竞赛。
    改进了劳动组织，实行了分工和包干任务，就提高了劳动效率——这无疑是一个好的领导方法。因为这个办法能够把人们的劳动加以评比，比出先进，一般和落后，敦促人们去比先进、学先进、争先进。
    人们都有个比和赛的劲头，先进人人要争，落后谁也不爱。因此，人人都鼓起干劲，力争上游——这正符合了总路线的精神。由此可见，正确地建立劳动组织，组织劳动竞赛是多么重要！
