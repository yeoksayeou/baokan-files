Drilling Busily Amidst the White Snow
　　By Our Correspondent
    In the Great Leap Forward, the staff and workers of the Qilian Mountain Geological Team carried out two "revolutions" in geological exploration: persevering in drilling without stopping work in winter; and changing from surveying first and then prospecting to prospecting first and then surveying, which accelerated the progress of exploration.
    Now, entering the Qilian Mountains, one can see drill towers standing on the high snow-capped mountains, the sound of motors echoing through the valleys, and vehicles moving like a flowing stream on the mining area roads. This is a big change since last year. In the past, in such high and cold areas, work had to be stopped every winter and resumed only when the weather warmed up in the spring of the following year. This meant only six or seven months of work a year. Since the Great Leap Forward, the staff and workers of the Qilian Mountain Geological Team felt that if they continued like this, they would never be able to explore the mineral deposits of the Qilian Mountains! In order to accelerate socialist construction, many people proposed to persist in winter drilling and turn the six or seven months of work per year into year-round continuous drilling. Were there difficulties? Yes, there were difficulties; but there were also favorable conditions. The difficulty was that it was colder in winter, but as long as good cold-proof equipment was used to ensure the drill could operate, it could be maintained. The favorable condition was that it snowed but did not rain in winter. Once the Qilian Mountains entered June and July, the rainy season arrived, it rained almost every day, the roads were muddy, and the tents leaked, making it inconvenient to work. Therefore, the staff and workers regarded winter as a great time.
    Not long ago, the reporter climbed to the summit of a snow mountain more than 4,000 meters above sea level. There, the drill towers were wearing cold-proof coats, and the drillers were working normally. In the cotton tents, people who had just finished their shifts were washing their faces, reading books and newspapers; the cook in the kitchen was preparing dinner. Workers installing water pipes were busy connecting pipes, and transport workers were carrying back baskets up and down the icy mountain slopes, one after another... Everywhere was full of vitality and the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward.
    The staff and workers of the field prospecting team displayed the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act in the Great Leap Forward. They analyzed the past situation and believed that the old rules of surveying first and then prospecting were not suitable for the requirements of the Great Leap Forward, so they resolutely changed their approach and strived to find the mineral types urgently needed by the country as soon as possible. Whether in river ditches or on mountain slopes, as long as they saw a piece of ore or an outcrop, they would track it down, and when they determined that a certain mountain really had minerals, they would fill in the geological map. This greatly accelerated the progress of the prospecting work.

    白雪皑皑钻探忙
    本报记者
    祁连山地质队的职工们，在大跃进当中，对地质勘探进行了两项“革命”——冬季不收工坚持钻探；改先填图后找矿为先找矿后填图，加速了勘探进度。
    现在，进入祁连山就可以看到在高高的雪山上矗立着一座座钻塔，马达声响彻山谷，矿区公路上，车水马龙。这是去年以来一个很大的变化。在以往，像这种高寒地区，每到冬季就要收工，等到第二年春暖花开的时候，再进入工地。算起来一年只有六、七个月的工作时间。自从大跃进以来，祁连山地质队的职工们觉得老这样下去，不知什么时候才能把祁连山的矿藏勘探清楚！为了加速社会主义建设，很多人提议坚持冬季钻探，把一年六、七个月的工作时间变成全年不停钻。有困难没有呢？有困难；但是也有有利条件。困难是冬季冷些，但只要搞好防寒设备，保证钻机能转动就可以坚持。有利条件是冬季下雪不下雨。祁连山一进入六、七月，雨季来临，差不多天天下雨，道路泥泞、帐篷漏水，工作起来很不方便。因此，职工们把冬季当成了大好时光。
    不久以前，记者登上一个海拔四千多公尺的雪山顶峰。那里钻塔穿着防寒外衣，钻工们在正常地工作。棉帐房里刚下了班的人们，有的在洗脸，有的在读书看报；厨房里的炊事员正在准备晚饭。接水管的工人在紧张地安接管子，运输工在山坡冰路上，背着背斗上上下下，络绎不绝……这里到处充满活力，充满了大跃进的气息。
    野外普查队的职工们，在大跃进中发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格。他们分析了过去的情况，认为以往先填图后找矿的老规矩不适应大跃进的要求，便坚决改变作法，为尽快地找到国家急需的矿种而努力。他们不论在河沟里或是山坡上，只要见到一块矿石或一个露头，便跟踪追击，当认定某一座山确实有矿以后，便把地质图填下来。这样使得普查工作的进度大大加快。
