    Who is the Target Audience?
    Yu Meng, Xi'an City
    The following is the film advertisement of Xi'an Children's Cinema for several days:
    "The Story of Qin Xianglian," "Beautiful Friends" (French feature film), "Fire" (Hong Kong feature film), "The White-Haired Girl," "Battle Before Dawn," "The Ancient Temple Bell"...
    At first, I thought this was just a temporary phenomenon, but as time went on, I found that the children's cinema was mostly showing this kind of film, so I felt that they had neglected the problem of serving children.
    Children's Cinema, as the name implies, serves children. To serve well, it is necessary to show some films suitable for children's appreciation ability. Otherwise, how can it be called "Children's Cinema"?
    Children like to watch movies very much, but they are not good at (and sometimes cannot) analyze the content of the film. In the innocent minds of children, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the boundaries of right and wrong. Good films suitable for children to watch have a great effect on cultivating children's communist ideas; films that are not suitable for children to watch, even if the content is not bad, have no educational significance for children, and sometimes have some bad effects on children. Films such as "Red Boy" and "Chicken Feather Letter" have indeed conducted vivid patriotic and collectivist education for children, but what kind of education can films like "Beautiful Friends" give children? Adults can have a deeper understanding of the decadent nature of the capitalist system in gorgeous cloaks after watching this film, but children can hardly understand it, and may even have side effects on them. Therefore, even good films are not necessarily suitable for children to watch.
    The above situation is mainly because there are fewer children's films. However, film distribution departments and children's cinemas can try to choose some films suitable for children from the existing films. As for the lack of children's films, that can only be requested of writers to meet the children's needs.

    对象是谁？
    西安市　于孟
    下面是西安市儿童影剧院几天的电影广告：
    “情探”、“漂亮的朋友”（法国故事片）、“火”（香港故事片）、“白毛女”、“黎明前的战斗”、“古刹钟声”……
    起先，我以为这不过是一时的现象，但日子一久，发现儿童影剧院演的大多是这一类的片子，于是我感到他们忽略了为儿童服务的问题。
    儿童影剧院，顾名思义，服务的对象是儿童。要服务得好，就要演出一些适合孩子欣赏能力的影片。不然，又怎么称得起是“儿童影剧院”呢？
    孩子们很喜欢看电影，但也还不善于（有时也不能）分析影片的内容。在孩子们天真无邪的脑海里，有时很难分清是非的界限。适合儿童看的好影片，对培养孩子的共产主义思想有着很大的作用；不适合儿童看的影片，尽管它的内容并无不好，可是对孩子却没有任何教育意义，有时候还会给孩子一些不好的影响。像“红孩子”“鸡毛信”等影片，的确对孩子们进行了生动的爱国主义和集体主义教育，但是像“漂亮的朋友”这类影片能给孩子们什么教益呢？大人看了这部影片，能够更深刻地认识到披着华丽外衣的资本主义制度的腐朽本质，但孩子们却很难理解，甚至还会对他们产生副作用。因此，即使是好的影片，有些也不一定适合儿童看。
    产生上面的情况主要是因为儿童影片比较少，不过，电影发行部门和儿童影剧院可以在现有的片子中尽量选择一些适合儿童看的影片。至于儿童电影片少，那只有提请作家们去满足孩子们的要求了。
