    Hebei's Thousand-Jin High-Yield Teams Compete Vigorously
    Lei Nan's Rice High-Yield Fields Plant Seedlings Quickly and Well
    A Large Number of "Six Good" Production Teams Emerge in Western Hunan

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: A competition movement, with production teams as the unit, striving for large-area and high-yield harvests of spring-sown grain crops and cotton, is unfolding in various parts of Hebei Province. Driven by the competition, the spring sowing preparation work in many areas has been done quickly and well.

    This competition movement is being carried out on the basis of commune rectification work. More than 900 people's communes across the province have established a unified leadership and hierarchical management system after preliminary rectification. The production teams of each commune are full of vigor and determined to compete for a higher position in this year's greater leap forward. The Satellite Production Team of Xinbozi People's Commune in Weichang County, Chengde Prefecture, proposed to all production teams in the prefecture to carry out a competition for thousand-jin high-yield teams. This proposal was quickly responded to by more than 400 production teams. Production teams in Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding and other prefectures participating in the competition have delineated large-area high-yield plots. According to statistics from seven counties alone, more than 3,000 hundred-mu or thousand-mu grain and cotton high-yield plots have been delineated, covering a total area of ​​more than 1.49 million mu. More than 2,900 high-yield professional teams have been formed by production teams participating in the competition in five counties including Qinglong and Nangong, with a total of more than 150,000 people participating in the professional teams.

    The production teams participating in the large-area, high-yield competition are conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in the high-yield fields, and summarizing and popularizing the successful advanced farming experiences in the local area during the Great Leap Forward last year. In order to strive for high cotton yields, the production teams participating in the competition in Ci County, Wuqiao and other three counties have universally promoted the planting method of cotton seedling raising and transplanting. According to statistics from 22 people's communes, the production teams have established a total of 2,570 cotton seedling greenhouses and more than 4,480 fire-warmed sunbeds, cultivating more than 814 million seedlings. Ci County, Mancheng and other places have also summarized and promoted cotton planting techniques such as high-ridge cultivation.

    The large-area, high-yield competition movement with production teams as the unit has powerfully promoted the current spring plowing production. An'guo County convened mobilization meetings in high-yield fields with production teams as the unit, showing conditions and comparing efforts to mobilize 80,000 commune members to participate in the land preparation and deep plowing work of spring planting fields, and quickly completed the field projects of 150,000 mu of grain crops, cotton, peanuts, medicinal materials and other high-yield plots. During the spring plowing, the production teams of the people's communes in Baoding Prefecture competed in deep plowing, land preparation, and fertilizer application in high-yield fields. Two-thirds of the three million mu of spring-sown high-yield fields in the entire region were deeply plowed to more than one chi and two cun, and most production teams also carried out layered fertilizer application during deep plowing. In Chengde, Zhangjiakou and other places where farming was relatively extensive in the past, they are also actively building water conservancy projects, leveling land, and promoting garden-style farming techniques.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th: The production teams of people's communes in Leinan County, Guangdong, have universally launched high-yield competitions, and spring plowing production is being carried out quickly and well. Since the start of rice transplanting, by the 22nd, more than 70% of the transplanting tasks in the county's 250,000 mu of high-yield rice fields had been completed according to quality specifications.

    The high-yield competition between production teams of people's communes throughout the county adopts the method of finding competitors within the management area and conducting regular evaluations to determine the final winner during the summer harvest. The content of the regular evaluation is: compare effort, compare measures, compare progress, and compare quality. After each evaluation, the competition red flag will be sent to the winning production team.

    As soon as the competition started, the production teams of various people's communes set up camps and settled in the fields. The communes and management areas established field headquarters, and the competition reached a surging climax. The party branch secretaries and captains of each production team lived in the fields and worked alongside the commune members. Some time ago, there were two days of howling winds and drizzling rain, but the production teams still persisted in hard work. In the red flag competition, each production team came up with many ways to improve transplanting efficiency. The production teams of Yingli People's Commune adopted the method of small group challenge, with each group of more than ten people, divided the work of transplanting, strengthening seedlings, and shoveling seedlings, and carried out assembly line operations, which doubled or tripled the labor efficiency. The production teams of Jinhe People's Commune vigorously carried out the "examination of transplanting champions." More than 7,400 people in the commune signed up to participate, and a moving scene of couples and mothers and children striving to be "champions" appeared, and the labor efficiency was generally more than doubled. The production teams of each commune not only strived for fast transplanting progress, but also established and implemented inspection and research systems to ensure the specification quality of close planting.

    Through regular evaluations, the competition between production teams of various communes is lively and enthusiastic. The Field Production Team of Yingli People's Commune competed with the Maliu Production Team. In the first evaluation, the Field Production Team lost. The Field Team then beat gongs and drums to send the red flag to the Field of the Maliu Team. Upon receiving the red flag, the Maliu Production Team immediately held a swearing-in ceremony in the field, determined to keep the red flag. The Field Production Team also held a swearing-in ceremony that night, and their transplanting progress quadrupled the next day, catching up with the Maliu Team.

    Because the production teams of various communes give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm in the competition, the competition between management areas and communes is more solid and energetic. All eleven people's communes and all management areas in the county take the realization of high-yield early rice as the main competition indicator. When the county began to enter the busy season of transplanting, on the basis of ensuring the quality of transplanting, the Nanxing People's Commune took the lead in winning first place, with a daily progress of more than 2,400 mu of transplanting; the next day, the Jinhe People's Commune surpassed Nanxing with a daily progress of 3,000 mu of transplanting; then, the Yingli People's Commune again surpassed Jinhe with a daily progress of more than 3,500 mu of transplanting.

    Xinhua News Agency: The production teams of the people's communes in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan are launching a "Six Good" production team evaluation and competition movement, striving to achieve good leadership, good production, good planning, good life arrangement, good political and ideological education, and good operation and management, in order to better play the great superiority of the people's communes.

    This evaluation and competition movement of the production teams throughout the autonomous prefecture is based on the mass summary of the great superiority of the people's communes in various places in early March, and is carried out under the new situation that the work is becoming more and more detailed according to the characteristics of the people's communes of being large and public. In the previous period, party committees at all levels in the state took a series of measures to strengthen the leadership work of production teams, such as transferring a large number of cadres to enrich the grass-roots leadership of production teams, and the production teams further improved their operation and management, and established a production responsibility system, so that the production work was done better than in any previous year. Recently, through the launch of the "Six Good" evaluation and competition movement, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members for production has been even greater. In sixteen people's communes in Baojing County, eight communes are currently carrying out the "Six Good" competition in full swing. Through mass evaluation, 201 production teams in these eight communes have been rated as "Six Good" production teams. (Attached picture)

    社社抓紧领导新高潮
    队队火热竞赛夺丰收
    河北千斤丰产队竞赛有声有色
    雷南水稻丰产田插秧又快又好
    湘西“六好”生产队大量涌现
    据新华社天津讯　一个以生产队为单位力争春播粮食作物和棉花大面积高额丰产的竞赛运动，正在河北省各地展开。在竞赛的推动下，许多地区春播准备工作做得又快又好。
    这个竞赛运动是在整社工作的基础上开展起来的。全省九百多个人民公社，经过初步整顿，都建立了统一领导分级管理的制度；各公社的各个生产队都意气风发，决心在今年更大跃进中比个高低。承德专区围场县新拨子人民公社卫星生产队，向全专区各生产队提出了开展千斤丰产队的竞赛倡议，这个倡议很快就得到了四百多个生产队的响应。邯郸、石家庄、保定等专区参加竞赛的生产队，都划出了大面积丰产方，仅据七个县的统计，即已划好百亩的或千亩的粮食、棉花丰产方三千多个，面积共一百四十九万多亩。青龙、南宫等五个县参加竞赛的生产队，已经组成丰产专业队两千九百多个，参加专业队的共达十五万多人。
    参加大面积高额丰产竞赛的生产队，都在丰产田上认真贯彻农业八字宪法，并且总结推广了去年大跃进中当地成功的先进耕作经验。磁县、吴桥等三县参加竞赛的生产队，为了力争棉花高产，普遍推广了棉花育苗移栽的种植方法，据二十二个人民公社的统计，各生产队共建立棉苗温室两千五百七十间，火温阳畦四千四百八十多个，育苗八亿一千四百多万株。磁县、满城等地还总结推广了高垅栽培等植棉技术。
    以生产队为单位的大面积高额丰产竞赛运动，有力地推动了当前的春耕生产。安国县以生产队为单位在丰产田召开动员大会，亮条件、比干劲，动员八万名社员参加春种田地的整地深翻工作，很快就完成了十五万亩粮食作物、棉花、花生、药材等丰产方的田间工程。保定专区各人民公社生产队在春耕当中，比赛高额丰产田的深翻整地和铺肥，全区三百万亩春播丰产田有三分之二深翻到一尺二寸以上，绝大部分生产队还在深翻时进行了分层铺肥。过去耕作比较粗放的承德、张家口等地，也积极兴修水利，平整土地，推行园田化耕作技术。
    新华社广州26日电　广东雷南县各人民公社生产队普遍展开高额丰产竞赛，春耕生产搞得又快又好。插秧开始以来，到22日止，全县二十五万亩水稻高额丰产田，就已经按质量规格完成了七成多的插秧任务。
    全县各人民公社生产队之间的高额丰产竞赛，都采取在管理区内找竞赛对手，定期评比的办法，夏收时决定最后胜负。定期评比的内容是：比干劲、比措施、比进度、比质量。每次评比之后，都要把竞赛红旗送给优胜的生产队。
    竞赛一开始，各人民公社的生产队便纷纷到田头安营扎寨，公社及管理区都设立田头指挥部，竞赛的热潮汹涌澎湃。各生产队的党支部书记和队长都住在田头，同社员一起出勤。前些时，曾有两天狂风呼啸，寒雨纷飞，但是各生产队仍然坚持苦战。各生产队在红旗竞赛中，都想出许多办法来提高插秧效率。英利人民公社各生产队采用小组打擂台的办法，每个小组十多人，分工负责插秧、壮秧、铲秧，进行流水作业，劳动效率提高了一倍半到两倍。锦和人民公社各生产队大搞“考插秧状元”，全社有七千四百多人报名参加，出现了夫妻、母子争当“状元”的动人场面，劳动效率普遍提高了一倍多。各公社生产队不但力争插秧进度快，而且建立和执行检查研究制度，保证密植的规格质量。
    通过定期评比，各公社生产队之间的竞赛显得热气腾腾。英利人民公社的田头生产队同马流生产队竞赛，初次评比时，田头生产队输了。田头队便敲锣打鼓把红旗送到马流队的田头去。马流生产队接到红旗当即在田头誓师，决心保持红旗。田头生产队也在当天晚上举行誓师大会，第二天他们的插秧进度就翻了两番多，赶上了马流队。
    由于各公社生产队在竞赛中充分发挥积极性和主动性，这就使得管理区与管理区、公社与公社之间的竞赛显得更扎实，更带劲。全县十一个人民公社和所有各管理区都以实现早稻高额丰产作为主要的竞赛指标。当全县开始进入插秧大忙的时候，各公社在保证插秧质量的基础上，南兴人民公社首先争得第一，插秧日进二千四百多亩；第二天，锦和人民公社以插秧日进三千亩超过南兴；接着，英利人民公社又以插秧日进三千五百多亩超过锦和。
    新华社讯　湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州各人民公社生产队之间正在展开“六好”生产队评比竞赛运动，争取做到领导好、生产好、计划好、生活安排好、政治思想教育工作好和经营管理好，以便更好地发挥人民公社的巨大优越性。
    全自治州各生产队的这一评比竞赛运动，是在3月初各地群众性地总结人民公社巨大优越性的基础上，根据人民公社一大二公的特点要求工作越作越细致的新情况下开展起来的。前一时期，全州各级党委采取了一系列的措施加强生产队的领导工作，例如抽调大批干部充实生产队的基层领导，各生产队进一步改善了经营管理，建立了生产责任制，从而使生产工作做得比以往任何一年都好。最近，通过开展“六好”评比竞赛运动，广大社员生产劲头更大了。保靖县十六个人民公社中，目前已有八个公社的生产队热火朝天地开展“六好”竞赛，通过群众评比，这八个公社已经有二百零一个生产队被评为“六好”生产队。（附图片）
