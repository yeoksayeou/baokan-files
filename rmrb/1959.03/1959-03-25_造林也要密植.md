    Afforestation Also Requires Dense Planting
    Li Yuanzhou
    Reports indicate that Huainan, Tangshan, and other regions are taking advantage of the excellent spring weather to vigorously plant mine timber forests. This illustrates that one of the main purposes of cultivating forests is to produce timber to meet the needs of national economic construction and the people's livelihood. Therefore, increasing timber production is an important task in forest management. The conditions for increasing timber production are: first, a high number of trees per unit area; second, a large growth rate of the trees. To achieve these requirements, appropriate dense planting should be promoted.
    Densely planted trees, due to the large number of trees per unit area, can quickly have their branches and twigs close together in the early stages, forming a lush canopy covering the ground. Under the canopy, the light is weak, the soil is moist, and weeds are reduced, even completely eliminated. This creates favorable conditions for tree growth. The growth of weeds in forest land is harmful in most cases because their branches and leaves shade the seedlings from the sunlight they need, and their roots rob the seedlings of the water and nutrients they need, leading to poor seedling growth.
    Throughout the entire growth period of densely planted trees, the relationship between trees is one of mutual promotion and mutual constraint. The space occupied by each tree is limited, making it difficult for the tree's branches and twigs to develop in all directions. They can only develop upwards, which promotes the growth of tall and straight trunks. In densely planted forests, because the branches under the canopy do not receive sunlight and lose their ability to produce nutrients, they gradually wither and fall off, and cannot form large branches. Therefore, the shape of the tree trunk is round and full, with few knots. In contrast, sparsely planted forests tend to grow relatively short and stocky, with tree trunks that are thin at the top and thick at the bottom, and have many knots, making them difficult to become timber suitable for beams and pillars.
    Dense planting afforestation has its advantages, but this does not mean that the denser the better, without a limit. Planting too densely not only wastes seedlings and labor but, more importantly, fails to meet the requirements of increased production. This is because trees need a certain nutritional area (space and forest land) to allow their roots to continuously obtain water and mineral nutrients from the soil; and to allow the leaves and tender branches to fully utilize carbon dioxide and sunlight in the air to produce large amounts of nutrients to meet the tree's own growth needs. If planted too densely, although the moisture, minerals, and other nutrients in the forest land can be supplemented by human effort, the tree crowns are small, and the leaves are few, the reception of sunlight, and the manufacture of carbohydrates, are still limited. When the nutrients required by the trees are lacking, growth immediately slows down. Therefore, in afforestation, appropriate dense planting should be adopted, neither too sparse nor too dense.
    Generally, slow-growing trees should be planted more densely than fast-growing trees, and cold regions, high mountains, steep slopes, and areas with barren soil should be planted more densely than warm regions, low mountain gentle slopes, and areas with fertile soil. In terms of forest types, protective forests and fuelwood forests should be planted more densely than timber forests. Special economic forests, such as oil tea and tung trees, require vigorous branches and leaves, and more flowers and fruits, so they should not be too dense. Afforestation by sowing, which has a lower survival rate and slower seedling growth, should be denser. In short, density should be determined according to local conditions and tree species to cultivate the most ideal forest.

    造林也要密植
    栗元周
    报载淮南、唐山等地正在趁大好春光大造矿柱林，这正说明了培育林木的主要目的之一，是生产木材、满足国家经济建设和人民生活的需要。因此，提高木材产量是经营森林的重要任务。提高木材产量的条件，一是单位面积株数多；二是林木的生长量大。要达到这些要求，就应该推行适当密植造林。
    密植的树木，由于单位面积内株数多，在幼年阶段树木与树木的枝桠就能很快地靠拢，形成葱郁的林冠复盖着地面。在林冠下，光线暗弱，土壤湿润，杂草也因此减少，甚至完全绝迹了，这就给林木生长创造了良好的条件。林地滋生杂草，在大多数情况下是有害的，因为它的枝叶遮蔽树苗所需的阳光、根系夺取树苗所需的水分和养分，使树苗生长不良。
    密植的树木在整个成长期间，树木和树木的关系是互相促进互相制约的。每棵树占的空间有限，树木枝桠向四周发展就有困难，只有向上发展的可能，所以能促进树干长得又高又直。在密植的林子里，由于林冠下的树枝得不到阳光，失去了制造养分的作用，也就逐渐枯萎雕落，不能形成大的枝桠，所以树木的干形也就圆正饱满，很少节疤。与此相反，稀植的森林都生长得比较低矮，树干上端尖细，下端粗大，节疤又多，就难以成为栋梁之材。
    密植造林有好处，但这并不是说愈密愈好，没有一个限度。栽的过密了，不仅浪费种苗、劳力，而且更重要的是达不到增产的要求。因为树木要有一定的营养面积（空间和林地），才能使它的根系从土壤中不断地得到水分和矿物质养料；才能让叶子和幼嫩枝条充分利用空气中的二氧化碳和日光来大量制造养分，以满足林木本身生长的需要。如果栽植的过于密集，虽然林地的水分、矿物质等养分，可借人力加以补充，但是林木的树冠小、叶子少，在接受阳光，制造碳水化合物方面，还是受到限制。当树木所需要的养分，一旦缺乏的时候，生长就立即迟缓下来。所以在造林的时候，要适当密植，既不能太稀，也不能过密。
    一般是生长较慢的树木应比生长较快的树木栽密些，在寒冷地区和高山、陡坡、土质瘠薄的地方应比温暖地区和低山缓坡、土壤肥厚的地方密一些。从林种来说，防护林和薪炭林要比用材林栽得更密些，特种经济林如油茶、油桐等，要求枝叶旺盛，多开花、多结果，就不能过密。播种造林成活率较低，幼林生长较慢的，应当密一些。总而言之，要因地制宜，因树制宜地确定密度，才有可能培育出最理想的森林。
