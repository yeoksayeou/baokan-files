Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 25th. A national student representatives' meeting was held in Czechoslovakia on the 23rd and 24th. The meeting focused on discussing the strengthening of communist education for university students and the integration of study with productive labor.

The content discussed at this meeting was also to create conditions for the teaching reforms to be carried out in universities across the country from 1959 to 1960.

Vacek, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Youth League, made the main report at the meeting. He pointed out that the task of the university is to educate young people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and to cultivate true workers for the construction of the present and the future of the country. He emphasized that a revolutionary reform of the Czechoslovak teaching system must be carried out to make university education more closely integrated with productive labor. He pointed out that students can widely adopt the form of voluntary labor to participate in various practical work combined with their own majors, and should actively participate in various social activities.

Vacek pointed out the importance of opposing religious influence. He said that the purpose of ideological education is to cultivate students' firm belief in communism and their communist moral qualities.

Vacek also pointed out the need to strengthen the work of the Youth League among university students, strengthen the cooperation between the Youth League and teachers, so that the teaching reform work can be carried out smoothly.

Hendrych, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the teaching reform of Czechoslovak higher education institutions is closely related to the task of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communist construction. He criticized the shortcomings of some higher education institutions that only pay attention to book learning. He said that the communist moral character education of students cannot be separated from our practical tasks. Life is the best education and the strictest teacher. He emphasized that labor education should become one of the central links in university teaching.

After heated discussions on the report, the representatives passed a resolution, expressing their full support for the decision of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to bring university teaching closer to production and life, and called on university students to implement this decision with practical actions.

There are currently forty higher education institutions in Czechoslovakia, with 53,000 university students. Among them, 54% are children of workers and peasants.

    捷大学生代表会议通过决议
    大学教学要接近生产
    新华社布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克在23日和24日举行了全国大学生代表会议。这次会议着重讨论了加强对大学生的共产主义教育以及学习与生产劳动相结合的问题。
    这次会议所讨论的内容也是为了给1959到1960年将在全国各大学中进行的教学改革创造条件。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟主席维茨克尔在会上作了主要报告。他指出，大学的任务是要以马克思列宁主义精神教育青年，为国家培养出建设现在和未来的真正劳动者。他强调说，捷克斯洛伐克教学制度要进行革命性的改革，就必须使大学教育更密切地和生产劳动结合起来。他指出，学生们可以广泛采用义务劳动的形式参加各种与自己专业相结合的实际劳动，并且应该积极参加各种社会活动。
    维茨克尔指出了反对宗教影响的重要性。他说，思想教育的目的就是要培养学生们对共产主义的坚定信念，以及他们的共产主义道德品质。
    维茨克尔还指出要加强青年联盟在大学生中的工作，加强青年联盟和教师的合作，使教学改革工作能够顺利进行。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员亨德里赫在会上讲了话。他指出，捷克斯洛伐克高等学校教学改革是与完成社会主义建设以及逐步过渡到共产主义建设的任务密切相关的。他批评了某些高等学校中存在的只注意书本学习的缺点。他说，不能把对学生进行共产主义道德品质的教育同我们的实际任务分开。生活是最好的教育和最严格的老师。他强调指出，目前劳动教育应成为大学教学的中心环节之一。
    代表们对报告进行了热烈的讨论后，通过了一项决议，表示完全支持捷共第十一次代表大会关于大学教学进一步接近生产和生活的决定，并号召大学生们用实际行动贯彻这一决定。
    捷克斯洛伐克全国现有四十个高等学校，有五万三千个大学生。其中54％是工农子弟。
