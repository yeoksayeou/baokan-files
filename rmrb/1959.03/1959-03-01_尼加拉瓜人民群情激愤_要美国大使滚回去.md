Xinhua News Agency, Managua, 28th: The people opposing the pro-American Somoza government in Nicaragua have recently launched a movement demanding that the American Ambassador, Mr. Whelan, get out. Whelan has been the American ambassador to Nicaragua since 1951, and he has constantly interfered in Nicaragua's internal affairs.

It is reported that those opposing the pro-American government of Nicaragua recently made public the letters they wrote to the American ambassador some time ago. The letter accused that, over the past few years, the words and deeds of the American ambassador have shown that he is very close to the pro-American regime that oppresses the Nicaraguan people, and he has personally interfered in Nicaragua's internal affairs.

    尼加拉瓜人民群情激愤
    要美国大使滚回去
    新华社28日讯　马那瓜消息：反对索摩查亲美政府的人们最近掀起了一个要求美国大使惠兰滚回去的运动。惠兰自1951年起就担任美国驻尼加拉瓜的大使，他曾不断干预尼加拉瓜的内政。
    据报道，反对尼加拉瓜亲美政府的人最近向外界公布了他们在前些时候写给这位美国大使的信件。这封信件指责说，过去几年来，美国大使的言行都表明他同压迫尼加拉瓜人民的亲美政权十分亲近，而且还亲自干预了尼加拉瓜的内政问题。
