Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 8th: President Sukarno and Chairman Ho Chi Minh stated in a joint communiqué issued here today that they are convinced that the principles initiated at the 1955 Bandung Asian-African Conference can serve as a solid foundation for cooperation among nations in strengthening lasting world peace.

The two leaders believe that efforts should be stepped up to achieve disarmament and ban the production, testing, and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. They call on the countries concerned and world public opinion to achieve this goal.

They believe that the policy of establishing military blocs only leads to the intensification of international tensions. They also stated that they are determined to continue and strengthen efforts within their respective capacities to maintain world peace and promote mutual understanding among nations of the world. The two leaders believe that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations would ease international tensions and is also necessary for consolidating peace.

The two leaders stated that they are prepared to support the struggles of all colonial peoples for independence. They believe that the various consequences of colonial rule and exploitation of peoples will endanger world peace. They noted with satisfaction that since the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the struggles of several Asian and African countries for independence have achieved victory. They believe that colonialism and imperialism must be eliminated, regardless of the reasons put forward, or the forms and manifestations adopted.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in exchanging views and making public statements, has constantly emphasized that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supports the struggle of the Indonesian people for West Irian to return to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia.

The two leaders believe that the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords should be used to resolve the reunification of Vietnam.

The two leaders studied the issue of a country being divided into several separate states, and believe that these divided parts should be reunited on a peaceful and democratic basis, as this would bring full happiness and prosperity to the countries concerned, and would also make a positive contribution to world peace.

The two leaders agreed that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit and that of his entourage were very fruitful, and further strengthened the original fraternal friendly relations between the Indonesian and Vietnamese peoples. The two leaders exchanged views extensively and carefully on the international situation and issues of common concern to the two countries.

The communiqué stated that Chairman Ho Chi Minh formally invited President Sukarno to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Sukarno happily and gratefully accepted the invitation.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 8th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh and his entourage left Jakarta by plane this morning to return home after a ten-day visit to Indonesia. President Sukarno went to the airport to see them off.

Many people stood on the airport and roads leading to the airport to see him off. They released peace doves, colorful balloons, and shouted slogans such as "Long live Uncle Ho!"

Chairman Ho Chi Minh delivered a farewell speech at the airport, saying that he was reluctant to leave Indonesia because "I love this country and its people, and I fully know that many of you also like me." He said that wherever he went in Indonesia, he received a warm and cordial welcome. The Indonesian people have always shown warm friendship to the Vietnamese people. He expressed his gratitude to the President, Parliament, government and people of Indonesia.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh reiterated his belief that the Indonesian people will certainly liberate West Irian, successfully create a free and happy life, and build a strong and prosperous country.

He said that his visit will strengthen the friendship between the two countries, and he will bring the close friendship of the fraternal Indonesian people to the Vietnamese people. He said that the Vietnamese people would be very happy to hear that President Sukarno would visit Vietnam.

President Sukarno also delivered an enthusiastic speech. He said: "I deeply respect you and the Vietnamese people. Therefore, it is difficult for me to express my feelings at this moment on behalf of the Indonesian people and myself."

He also said: "I hope that your whole country will be as close to Indonesia as possible. However, no one can geographically bring the two countries closer together, but our hearts can do this. Our experience shows that our hearts are close to each other. My next visit to Vietnam will bring our hearts even closer."

"We will work hand in hand on the road to complete freedom and happiness for all mankind, to brotherly relations between peoples, to world peace and world prosperity."

As Chairman Ho Chi Minh was about to board the plane, President Sukarno and Chairman Ho Chi Minh embraced and said goodbye again.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and his entourage will spend the night in Medan, North Sumatra, before leaving Indonesia to return home. Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo and Chairman of the Foreign Heads of State Reception Committee Hanafi accompanied Chairman Ho Chi Minh to Medan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 7th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh hosted a banquet for President Sukarno on the evening of the 7th.

Those attending the banquet included Prime Minister Djuanda, Speaker of Parliament Sartono, Foreign Minister Subandrio, and other government officials, military officers, and foreign diplomatic envoys.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in his speech at the banquet that he had received a grand and warm welcome wherever he went in Indonesia. This vividly demonstrates the sincere friendship of the Indonesian people towards the Vietnamese people. He said that the Indonesian people, under the leadership of President Sukarno, will achieve great achievements in building a prosperous country, and will also achieve glorious victories in recovering West Irian to complete national reunification.

He said, "The very sincere talks between us and President Sukarno and other Indonesian leaders have proved that our two countries have consistent views on the current international issues and on issues of common concern to the Vietnamese and Indonesian peoples." He said, "Our friendly visit will certainly further strengthen the solid ties that exist very amicably between our two countries."

He expressed his sincere gratitude to President Sukarno and other Indonesian hosts for their hospitality.

President Sukarno referred to Chairman Ho Chi Minh as his comrade-in-arms in his speech. He also said that he would visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
