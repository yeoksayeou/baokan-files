To supplement teacher shortages and provide students with practical opportunities, Jilin Normal University is assisting in teaching at newly established schools.

According to the Jilin Daily, faculty and students of Jilin Normal University are actively assisting in the teaching work of newly established local schools and spare-time schools for workers in factories and mines. In the past six months, in addition to the political education, education, and history departments participating in cultural revolution activities and assisting in the construction of thousands of various types of schools in local areas, all departments have generally established cooperative relationships with newly established schools, factories, mines, and enterprises to assist them in their teaching work. According to incomplete statistics alone, a total of 44 teachers and 317 students have been concurrently teaching at 87 units. After the start of the new semester, appropriate adjustments were made to the part-time teaching work in outside units, but there are still 33 teachers and 164 students currently teaching part-time in 23 units. According to reports from some of the units where they teach, the results have been quite good. This not only solves the problem of teacher shortages for various units, but also provides some students with educational practice opportunities. Some teachers and students have also compiled teaching materials or syllabuses suitable for the students' situations in the teaching process, laying a preliminary foundation for the future teaching work of various units.

The Department of Political Science once had more than 50 students teaching at 29 lecture points in 42 units, including the Changchun Municipal Party School, workers' spare-time schools, and schools for cadres of government organizations. While engaging in teaching work, they also learned from the workers through contact with them, which produced good results. The Department of Education established an educational experimental zone in Jiutai County and established various types of schools, which is of great significance for the development of local education and the teaching of the Department of Education. While teaching part-time, the Department of Mathematics also identified many meaningful scientific research topics from production units and engaged in scientific research work. In the past six months, Jilin Normal University has also supported or helped other schools train many teachers, including 41 teachers for institutions of higher learning and 17 for secondary schools. It has accepted 28 teachers from other schools for advanced studies and 36 auditors.

    补师资的不足　给学生实践机会
    吉林师大协助新建学校教学
    据吉林日报消息　吉林师范大学的师生们积极协助地方新建学校和厂矿企业职工业余学校的教学工作。半年以来，除了政治教育、教育、历史各系参加文化革命活动，协助地方兴建了上千所各类学校以外，各系普遍与新建学校、厂矿企业、机关建立了协作关系，协助他们进行教学工作。仅就不完全统计，总共有教师四十四人、学生三百一十七人分别在八十七个单位兼任教学工作。新学期开学后，对在外单位的兼课工作做了适当调整，但现在仍有教师三十三人、学生一百六十四人分别在二十三个单位兼课。根据某些任课单位反映，效果还比较好。这不仅为各单位解决部分师资问题，同时也给部分学生提供了教育实践的机会。有些教师和学生在教学过程中还编写了适合学员情况的教材或教学大纲，为各单位今后的教学工作打下了一个初步基础。
    政治系曾有五十多名学生在长春市的党校、工人业余学校、机关干部学校等四十二个单位的二十九个讲课点担任教学工作。他们一方面从事教学工作，同时也通过与工人接触，向工人学习，收到了良好的效果。教育系在九台县建立了教育实验区，成立了各类学校，这对当地教育事业的发展和教育系的教学都有着重要意义。数学系在兼课的同时，还从生产单位找出许多有意义的科学研究题目，从事科学研究工作。半年以来，吉林师大还支援或帮助外校培养许多师资，其中支援高等学校师资有四十一名，中等学校有十七名。接受外校进修教师二十八名，旁听生三十六名。
