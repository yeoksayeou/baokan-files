Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, Blantyre Dispatch: The heroic struggle of the Nyasaland Africans against British colonial rule continues to develop. Despite the colonial authorities dispatching large numbers of military police to carry out bloody suppression, mass resistance activities have penetrated into remote areas. In many places, the roads are still full of obstacles, and telephone lines in many areas have been cut by Africans.

On the 7th, in the Mulanje area of southeastern Nyasaland, which is rich in tea production (adjacent to the Portuguese colony of Mozambique), hundreds of Africans launched anti-colonialist activities in a tea plantation. They surrounded the residences of the colonialists and conducted propaganda among the African workers, calling on them to strike. Later, a large number of colonial police rushed to suppress the activity and shot and killed two Africans. The vast majority of tea plantations in this area are owned by British companies, employing 25,000 African workers and producing 12 million pounds of tea annually.

Reports indicate that after this bloody struggle, approximately 500 Africans marched en masse from this plantation to nearby Limbe, setting up roadblocks as they went. Colonial troops are being dispatched to intercept this group. The police have carried out mass arrests in the Mulanje area, with 60 people arrested. In the Central Province of Nyasaland, struggles against the colonialists took place in Sanchizeng last Saturday. Currently, in this area, colonial authorities' aircraft are constantly patrolling and distributing threatening leaflets.

In order to plan the next countermeasures to suppress the Nyasaland people's anti-colonial rule struggle, the heads of the Central African Federation colonial authorities held a secret meeting at Chileka Airport on the outskirts of Blantyre on the 8th. Under heavy guard, those attending the meeting included British High Commissioner to the Federation, Metcalfe, Federal Prime Minister Welensky, Southern Rhodesia Prime Minister Whitehead, and Nyasaland Governor Armitage.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 8th: Hundreds of Africans, Asians, West Indians, and British people held a demonstration march here today to oppose British colonial rule in Nyasaland and other parts of Africa. Nyasaland Legislative Assembly member Chiume also participated in the demonstration march.

The demonstrators marched from Hyde Park, through the streets of central London, and past the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation Office. They angrily shouted slogans: "Give Africans Freedom," "No Interference in Africa," "Welensky Must Go," and "Get Out of Africa."

A rally was held after the demonstration march. Chiume said at the rally: "The people of Nyasaland will never give up their struggle for autonomy and against the Federation." He said: "We, the people of Nyasaland, are determined to be masters of our own house and not other masters. We are determined to make that day come, we must send the British flag back to Britain, and replace it with the flag of black Nyasaland."

    尼亚萨兰人民誓死反抗殖民统治
    群众性的斗争继续扩大深入边远地区
    伦敦群众示威游行高呼英国滚出非洲
    新华社9日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰非洲人誓死反抗英国殖民统治的英勇斗争仍在发展中。尽管殖民当局派出大批军警进行血腥镇压，群众性的反抗活动已经深入边远地区。许多地方的公路到目前仍然堆满障碍，不少地区的电话线已被非洲人切断。
    7日，在尼亚萨兰东南部盛产茶叶的姆兰杰地区（同葡萄牙殖民地莫三鼻给接壤处），数百名非洲人在一个茶叶种植园中展开了反殖民主义的活动。他们包围了殖民者的住宅，并向非洲工人进行宣传，号召他们罢工。后来大批殖民警察赶来镇压，并开枪打死两名非洲人。在这一地区的茶叶种植园绝大部分都属于英国企业所有，雇有两万五千名非洲工人，年产茶达一千二百万磅。
    有消息说，在发生这一流血斗争后，约五百名非洲人从这个种植园成批地走到附近的林布利，他们一面走一面安设路障。殖民军队正被派去拦截这支队伍。警察在姆兰杰地区大肆逮捕，被捕者已达六十人。在尼亚萨兰中部省，上星期六在桑契曾发生反对殖民者的斗争。目前，在这一地区，殖民当局的飞机不断巡逻，并散发威胁性的传单。
    为了策划镇压尼亚萨兰人民反殖民统治斗争的下一步对策，中非联邦殖民当局的首脑人物8日在布兰太尔的郊外契利卡机场进行了秘密会谈。在戒备森严情况下参加会谈的有英国驻这个联邦的高级专员梅特卡夫、联邦总理韦伦斯基、南罗得西亚总理怀特赫德和尼亚萨兰总督阿米塔季。
    新华社伦敦8日电　数百名非洲人、亚洲人、西印度群岛人和英国人今天在这里举行示威游行，反对英国在尼亚萨兰和非洲其他地区的殖民统治。尼亚萨兰立法议会委员丘梅也参加了这次示威游行。
    示威游行的人从海德公园出发，经过伦敦市中心区的街道，并经过罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦办事处。他们激愤地高呼口号：“给非洲人自由”，“不准干涉非洲”，“韦伦斯基必须滚蛋”，“滚出非洲去”。
    示威游行后举行了大会。丘梅在大会上说：“尼亚萨兰人民决不放弃他们的争取自治和反对联邦的斗争。”他说：“我们尼亚萨兰人决心要自己当家作主人，而不要其他主人。我们决心使这一天到来，必须把英国国旗送回英国，而由尼亚萨兰黑人的旗帜来代替它。”
