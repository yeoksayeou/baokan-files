    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: Nosaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement in the "Akahata" today, calling on all Japanese women to strengthen the struggle for peace, for the happiness of women and children, to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

    Nosaka Sanzō said that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan gives us a clear guarantee: the ideal of mankind—communism—will soon be established on Earth. There, all working people and women will enjoy a beautiful and happy life.

    Nosaka Sanzō pointed out that, on the contrary, the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital are attempting to strengthen their military alliance with the United States by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They also want to restore the conscription system, strengthen the exploitation of the working class, and revive their pre-World War II aggressive ambitions. Nosaka pointed out that the dismissal of female workers, increased labor intensity, wage reductions, the implementation of the "performance evaluation" system, and the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" due to the promotion of "corporate rationalization" are all the results of this conspiracy by the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital. In this way, they want to further deprive the Japanese working class, women, and children of their rights and force them into a more miserable situation.

    Nosaka Sanzō called on all Japanese women to further strengthen their power in the struggle for peace, for the happiness of women and children, and against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," and to fight to the end to achieve the goals of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government, preventing the revision, and striving for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 6th Dispatch: The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published on the 6th a speech by Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, in response to questions from Fabiyan, a reporter from the newspaper stationed in Beijing.

    Miyamoto Kenji said that the basic content of the recent large-scale parades, demonstrations, and strikes in Japan is to oppose war, to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's policy of subservience to the United States and the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to oppose unemployment and demand higher wages.

    Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" means giving the United States the right to turn its current military bases in Japan into atomic bases, and will promote the revival of Japanese militarism to realize the United States' aggressive aims in the Far East. Therefore, the broad masses of the Japanese people firmly oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and warmly support the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Far East.

    Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that the most important task of the Japanese Communist Party at present is to unite all democratic forces, expand the united front, and fight to defend peace and democratic rights. At present, united front organizations have been established in forty of the more than forty prefectures in Japan. The Communist Party plays an important role in these organizations. All attempts to isolate the Communist Party have failed, and an increasingly wider range of the masses realize that without the Communist Party, it is impossible to defend the interests of the people.

    Speaking of Sino-Japanese relations, Miyamoto Kenji said that the Japanese people are demanding improved relations with the People's Republic of China and the establishment of friendly neighborly relations. At present, this call is becoming increasingly stronger in Japan. For example, ten million badges calling for improved Sino-Japanese relations were sold in a very short period.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: The participants in the Japanese People's Grand Parade Against War and Unemployment unanimously adopted a summary report on the results of the grand parade and the two-day group discussions at the concluding meeting held today.

    The summary report emphasized that the grand parade successfully organized people from a wide range of strata under the slogans of opposing war and unemployment, dealing a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government's war and corrupt policies. The report said that through this grand parade, many places have established long-term joint struggle organizations with the participation of local organizations of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which is a great achievement of the grand parade.

    The summary report also pointed out that this grand parade will help organize Japanese peasants, small business owners, merchants, and poor people from all walks of life.

    Regarding how to carry out the movement at present to achieve the goals of the grand parade, the report said that the movement that started from this grand parade must be developed into a struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The report emphasized that considering the important role of unemployed workers in the people's struggle, it is necessary for unemployed workers to establish close cooperation with organized workers and actively participate in the spring struggle of the working class.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: Ten Japanese trade union organizations issued a joint statement on the 6th, calling on the Japanese working class and the Japanese people to strengthen the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China policy and to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in order to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade.

    The statement said that since the Kishi Nobusuke government destroyed the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement last May, cutting off Sino-Japanese trade, the Japanese economy, especially small and medium-sized enterprises and their workers, has suffered a heavy blow. As their awareness increases, the demands of these people for the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade have turned into calls for the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its anti-China policy, and have further combined with the democratic forces' movement against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," gradually developing into a national movement demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

    The statement warned some people not to be misled by the deceptive gestures made by the Kishi Nobusuke government recently on the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, and to harbor illusions about Sino-Japanese trade. The statement pointed out that this is actually blindly agreeing to the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of "separating politics from economics" in Sino-Japanese relations.

    The statement pointed out that there is only one road and no second road to the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade, and that is to urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to change its anti-China policy. The statement pointed out that at present, it is necessary to further expand the national movement against the anti-China policy, demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang Treaty, and striving for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

    The statement called on the Japanese people to launch a struggle centered on the working class on the basis of the victory in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," and to strive to smash the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the low-wage policy.

    The ten trade union organizations are: Electrical Machinery Workers' Union, Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, National Metal Workers' Union, Vehicle Industry Workers' Union Federation, All Japan Electric Wire Industry Workers' Union, All Japan Harbor Workers' Union, National Sewing Machine Trade Union Council, All Japan Bicycle Trade Union Federation, and Tokyo Trade Union Promotion Council for International Trade.

    野坂参三和宫本显治分别发表谈话
    号召加强斗争废除“安全条约”打倒岸内阁
    日本人民大游行给予岸内阁战争政策以沉重打击
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，号召全体日本妇女为和平，为妇女和儿童的幸福，加强进行废除日美“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁的斗争。
    野坂参三说，苏联七年计划给我们以明确的保证：人类的理想——共产主义不久将建立在地球上。在那里所有的劳动人民和妇女将享受美好、幸福的生活。
    野坂参三指出，与此相反，岸信介政府和垄断资本正企图通过修改日美“安全条约”来加强同美国的军事同盟，还想恢复征兵制度，加强对工人阶级的剥削，重新实现大战以前的侵略野心。野坂指出，因为推行“企业合理化”而解雇女工、提高劳动强度、降低工资和实行“勤务评定”制度以及修改“警察官职务执行法”，都是由于岸信介政府与垄断资本的这种阴谋而产生的。它们就是这样想进一步剥夺日本工人阶级和妇女以及儿童的权利，迫使他们陷入更悲惨的处境。
    野坂参三号召全体日本妇女进一步加强在争取和平、争取妇女和儿童的幸福、反对修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争上所发挥的力量，为实现打倒岸信介政府、阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的目标而奋斗到底。
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”6日刊登了日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治答复这家报纸驻北京记者法彼扬的问题时的讲话。
    宫本显治说，最近在日本掀起的大规模的游行示威和罢工运动的基本内容是反对战争，反对岸信介屈从美国的政策和修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋，以及反对失业和要求提高工资。
    宫本显治指出，修改日美“安全条约”，意味着将使美国有权把目前在日本的军事基地变成原子基地，并且将促进日本军国主义的复活，来实现美国在远东的侵略目的。因此，日本广大群众坚决反对修改日美“安全条约”，热烈拥护苏联关于在远东建立无原子地区的建议。
    宫本显治指出，日本共产党目前最主要的任务是：团结一切民主力量，扩大统一战线，为保卫和平和民主权利而斗争。现在，在日本全国的四十多个县中，已经有四十个县建立了统一战线组织。共产党在这些组织中起着重要的作用。一切企图孤立共产党的阴谋都破产了，越来越广泛的群众认识到，没有共产党，就无法保卫人民的利益。
    宫本显治在谈到中日关系时说，日本人民正在要求改善同中华人民共和国的关系，要求建立友好的邻邦关系。目前，这种呼声在日本愈来愈强烈。例如，为争取改善中日关系而发出的徽章在很短期间就卖出了一千万枚。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对战争和失业大游行的参加者在今天举行的总结会议上，一致通过了关于这次大游行和为时两天的小组讨论结果的总结报告。
    总结报告强调指出，这次大游行在反对战争和失业的口号下成功地组织了广泛阶层的人民，给予岸信介政府的战争和腐败政策以沉重的打击。报告说，通过这次大游行，许多地方成立了有社会党和共产党地方组织参加的长期联合斗争组织，这是大游行所取得的巨大成就。
    总结报告还指出，这次大游行将有助于把日本农民、小企业者、商人和各界穷苦人民组织起来。
    谈到关于目前如何开展运动来实现大游行的目标时，报告说，必须把从这次大游行开始的运动发展为阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。报告强调说，考虑到失业工人在人民斗争中的重要作用，失业工人有必要同有组织的工人建立密切的合作，并且积极参加工人阶级的春季斗争。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本的十个工会团体6日发表联合声明，号召日本工人阶级和日本人民加强反对岸信介政府敌视中国政策和粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争，以争取恢复日中邦交和恢复日中贸易。
    声明说，自从去年5月岸信介政府破坏第四次日中贸易协定使日中贸易断绝以来，日本经济尤其是中小企业和它的工人受到了沉重的打击。这些人对于恢复日中贸易的要求，随着觉悟的提高，变成了要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国政策的声浪，并且进一步同民主力量的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”和反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动结合起来，逐渐发展为要求恢复日中邦交的国民运动。
    声明警告一些人不要受岸信介政府最近在日中贸易问题上所作出的欺骗姿态的迷惑，而对日中贸易存在幻想。声明指出，这样实际上就是盲目地同意岸信介政府在日中关系上要把“政治与经济分开”的政策。
    声明指出，恢复日中贸易的道路只有一条而没有第二条，这就是促使岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策。声明指出，目前必须进一步扩展反对敌视中国政策、要求废除日美“安全条约”和日蒋条约、争取恢复日中邦交的国民运动。
    声明号召日本人民在反对修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争胜利的基础上，展开以工人阶级为核心的斗争，争取粉碎日美“安全条约”和低工资政策。
    这十个工会团体是：电机工联、日本钢铁产业工会联合会、全日本造船工会、全国金属工会、车辆产业工会联合会、全日本电线工业工会、全日本港湾工会、全国缝纫机工会协议会、全日本自行车工会联合会和东京工会促进国际贸易协议会。
