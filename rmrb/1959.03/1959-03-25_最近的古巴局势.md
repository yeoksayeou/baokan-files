    Recent Situation in Cuba
    Zhang Ye

    The overthrow of the Batista dictatorship was a major victory for the Cuban people's national and democratic revolution. However, the struggle of the Cuban people has not ended. They are raising their vigilance, strengthening unity, and waging new struggles to oppose the various conspiracies of US imperialism and domestic reactionaries, defend the fruits of victory, and continue to develop the revolution.

    The current characteristic of the Cuban situation is that the struggle has entered a new, more arduous, and more complex stage. The enemies of the Cuban people, first and foremost US imperialism and its running dog, the remnants of Batista, are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the development of the Cuban revolution, attempting to overthrow the new Cuban government and restore the pro-American traitorous dictatorship. But this conspiracy has been met with a powerful counterattack by the Cuban people.

    Destroying the Old Machine of Tyranny

    After overthrowing the Batista dictatorship, the Cuban people immediately established the Cuban Provisional Government headed by Urrutia, and then proceeded to destroy and reorganize the state and military machines representing the old system. Major measures in this regard include: dissolving the old Congress and the special courts of the former dictatorial regime; removing all governors, mayors, and members of parliament of the reactionary regime from their posts; reorganizing and appointing diplomatic envoys; purging Batista elements from central and local organs and schools, arresting and interrogating those criminals who committed treason and murder, and sentencing and executing them according to the severity of their crimes; depriving pseudo-election candidates of the right to hold public office; reorganizing the police, judicial organs, and army that suppressed the people under the old regime, and disbanding the reactionary organization "Bureau for the Suppression of Communist Activities" which specialized in arresting and killing patriotic democrats.

    The Cuban Provisional Government, mainly led by the "July 26th Movement" headed by Castro, is a power centered on the insurgent forces. It announced a program guaranteeing democratic freedoms, implementing land reform, and developing national industry, and pursued a policy of opposing American interference and maintaining national independence. The Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party) was unable to participate in this regime. However, the program of the Cuban Provisional Government and some of the measures it has taken are in line with the interests of the Cuban people and the nation, and therefore have received the support of the Cuban People's Socialist Party and the Cuban people. As for the re-established Cuban armed forces, they are entirely organized around the soldiers of the insurgent forces, about 70% of whom are farmers, and the rest are workers and professionals. All the soldiers who had been detained by the dictatorial tyrant for "disloyalty" were reinstated, while 1,066 Batista officers and soldiers from the old army were ordered to retire and demobilize, including 200 senior officers.

    The achievements of the new Cuban government in destroying the old machine of tyranny are enormous. However, the social and economic foundations of the dictatorial system have not yet been eliminated. In order to ensure the fruits of revolutionary victory and continue the development of the revolution, the Cuban people further demand the rectification and strengthening of the work of the provisional government; launching an offensive against the entire old judicial and legal field; abolishing all repressive and anti-democratic laws; re-examining all measures in the economic, financial, and labor fields in order to abolish and revise them; continuing to arrest and punish the remnants of Batista; giving the unions the greatest freedom and independence in accordance with the principles of trade union democracy, worker solidarity, and solidarity with the people of the world; and preparing to formulate a more democratic new constitution.

    Social and Economic Reform Work

    Since its establishment, the Cuban Provisional Government has taken a number of positive measures in establishing social order and democratizing domestic life. It quickly lifted martial law, restored civil liberties and trade union rights, abolished censorship, disbanded reactionary political parties that had aided Batista, allowed political parties (including the Cuban People's Socialist Party) and organizations that had been declared illegal by the reactionary regime to operate openly, allowed political exiles to return home, promulgated a provisional constitution reflecting the principles of the Cuban Constitution of 1940, and announced that free elections would be held in a year and a half to two years.

    In restoring the national economy, the Cuban Provisional Government has made road construction, port facility repair, guaranteeing the timely harvesting of sugarcane, and restoring sugar mill production its important tasks. Now the vast majority of sugar mills have resumed production, and it is expected that the total output of sugarcane this year will reach 5.8 million tons.

    Implementing land reform is a preliminary and important measure of Cuba's social and economic reform. Castro actively advocated the implementation of the land reform plan. On February 1, he personally led a land reform work commando team of 200 people to Oriente Province to distribute land that the government had repossessed or purchased from large landowners to 150,000 landless and land-poor peasants. A month later, on March 1, Castro went to Pinar del Río Province in the west and distributed 25,000 acres of land to 346 farmers. However, the current land reform is still being carried out in accordance with the "Third Decree" issued by the insurgent forces in their old base of Oriente Province in November 1958. This decree stipulates that state-owned land and private land to be purchased or confiscated should be divided into sizes of two to five caballerías (one caballería equals 13.42 hectares) and distributed free of charge to farmers who own less than five caballerías of land. The government will compensate for the confiscated wasteland of large landowners, and if the large landowners invest this money in industry, mining, and agriculture within two years, the government will grant them a ten-year tax exemption. According to this law, half of the country's land will be distributed to landless and land-poor farmers, and the first to be distributed will be state-owned uncultivated land and land that was illegally sold to domestic and foreign companies at extremely low prices by the dictatorial regime. It can be seen that this "Third Decree," promulgated during the armed struggle, has not yet touched the latifundia system, one of the root causes of Cuba's poverty and backwardness. The Cuban people demand the distribution of latifundia land. The peasant representative conference held in Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province, in February (Castro and some other insurgent leaders also participated in the conference) agreed to the basic principles of land reform in the "Third Decree" and also passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of the latifundia system, restricting the land area occupied by foreign large landowners and local latifundia owners, and distributing the excess land to farmers. Castro expressed his acceptance of these opinions and, in his inaugural speech as Prime Minister, said that the provisional government would soon pass a law that was broader than the "Third Decree." This law will centralize all proposals so that it can end the latifundia system.

    There are still many obstacles to implementing a relatively thorough land reform in Cuba. First of all, Cuba's large landowners, ranchers, and sugarcane growers are still trying to obstruct the current land reform work being carried out in accordance with the "Third Decree." They argue that restricting the land of large landowners will divide the land into small pieces, which will be detrimental to production, and demand that the government only distribute the land owned by the state to farmers. Secondly, there are also differences within the Cuban Provisional Government on how to implement land reform. The drafter of the "Third Decree," the current Minister of Agriculture, Sori Marín, does not agree to touch the latifundia system, which is one reason why the new land reform law has not yet been formally announced.

    After taking office as Prime Minister, Castro focused more on dealing with economic issues and also considered solving the unemployment problem by implementing industrialization. The new government inherited many unimaginable difficulties from the old regime. The state treasury, looted by Batista, had almost no money, and Batista took away a huge sum of $500 million looted from the people when he fled. During Batista's rule, Cuba's national debt had reached $1.5 billion. The long-term civil war has damaged many transportation lines and sugarcane plantations, paralyzed public works, and the number of unemployed has reached 700,000. Due to the decrease in the export price and quota of sugar, the Cuban economy faces serious difficulties. Therefore, in the program he announced when he took office as Prime Minister, Castro put forward the urgent tasks in the economic field: establishing a national merchant fleet, establishing national industries, and improving the material conditions of residents, especially farmers, workers, and staff. However, in order to achieve these urgent tasks, in addition to further implementing thorough land reform, it is first necessary to get rid of the economic control of US monopoly capital over Cuba. Everyone knows that during the years of Batista's reactionary rule, US monopoly capital's direct investment in Cuba had reached as high as $1 billion, ranking third among US direct investments in Latin American countries. Through these investments and Batista's betrayal, the United States firmly controlled the economic lifelines of Cuba's sugar, iron ore, nickel mines, and public utilities such as transportation, electricity, and telephone. This has created Cuba's poverty and dependence on the United States. If it is not possible to get rid of American economic control first, it will be difficult to guarantee the independent development of the Cuban economy.

    Unite, Be Vigilant, and Continue to Advance

    The victory of the Cuban people's revolution and its continued development have caused great panic among US imperialism and the Cuban reactionaries. They are not reconciled to their failure. They are doing their utmost to maintain political and economic control over Cuba and to block the far-reaching impact of the Cuban revolution on the struggles of the people of other Latin American countries.

  In the early days of Cuba's victory, US imperialism once attempted to send warships to Cuba for armed intervention. Later, it used the execution of Batista elements with notorious crimes as an excuse to carry out slander and interference. These conspiracies failed due to the resolute opposition of the Cuban people and the strong condemnation of world public opinion. However, they do not admit defeat and are still carrying out all kinds of overt and covert, political and economic conspiracies, attempting to force the Cuban Provisional Government to compromise and retreat. In addition to using the old trick of "communist threat" to scare the Cuban people and split the unity of the Cuban people, they also sent special agents to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, using the fact that there were no blacks in the cabinet and diplomatic missions to provoke relations between blacks and whites; at the same time, they used the method of pitting veterans against new soldiers and pitting the "July 26th Movement" against the left wing to split the Cuban armed forces. In the economic field, they used the weakness that Cuba's main income relies on the export of sugar and that the United States is almost the only market for Cuban sugar, threatening to restrict and reduce sugar imports from Cuba. In addition, although the Cuban Provisional Government has taken a firm attitude towards the execution of the remnants of Batista, the Cuban reactionary forces that the United States has nurtured for many years have not been completely eliminated, and many Batista elements have been taken in on American soil. In addition, Cuba is very close to the United States, and there are American military bases on Cuban territory, so US imperialism uses these conditions to instigate Cuban internal reactionaries to assassinate Castro and carry out subversive activities. One of the murderers who assassinated Castro uncovered by the Cuban Provisional Government was even a former US Naval Aviation pilot, Allen Robert Nye. Not only that, but recently, the pro-American regimes in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, under the instigation of the United States, have groundlessly clamored that there is a danger of "invasion from Cuba," creating tension in the Caribbean region and demanding that the United States "take immediate measures" to "maintain the security of the Caribbean"; at the same time, the United States directly helped the Dominican Republic establish a special Marine Corps, and American legislators openly advocated that the Organization of American States take "police action" in the Caribbean region. These aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism against the Cuban revolutionary regime have aroused the vigilance of the Cuban government and people. Cuban Prime Minister Castro called on the Cuban people at a mass rally of 100,000 people in Havana on the 22nd to mobilize the whole people to fight to defeat this aggressive conspiracy.

    All these situations show that the current struggle of the Cuban people is still arduous and complex. The key lies in unity. The Cuban people relied on unity to achieve the victory of overthrowing the dictatorial regime, and they also relied on unity to severely crack down on the American interference conspiracy. In the future, as long as the Cuban people continue to strengthen unity, they will be able to defend the fruits of the revolution and defeat the American aggression conspiracy.

    最近的古巴局势
    章叶
    巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的被推翻，是古巴人民民族、民主革命的重大胜利。但是，古巴人民的斗争，并没有因此结束。他们正在提高警惕，加强团结，为反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的各种阴谋活动，保卫胜利果实和继续发展革命进行新的斗争。
    目前古巴局势的特点是，斗争进入一个新的，更加艰巨和更加复杂的阶段。古巴人民的敌人，首先是美帝国主义和它的走狗巴蒂斯塔残余分子，正千方百计地阻挠和破坏古巴的革命的发展，妄图颠复古巴新政府，复辟亲美卖国独裁政权。但这个阴谋活动遭到了古巴人民有力的反击。
    摧毁旧的暴政机器
    古巴人民在推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权以后，立即成立了以乌鲁蒂亚为首的古巴临时政府，接着就对代表旧制度的国家机器和军事机器进行破坏和改组。在这方面的重大措施有：解散旧的国会和前独裁政权的特别法庭；解除反动政权所有的省长、市长和议员的职务；改组和任命外交使节；清洗中央和地方机关以及学校中的巴蒂斯塔分子，对其中犯有叛国和杀人罪行的罪犯，加以逮捕和审讯，并按情节轻重分别判刑和处决；剥夺伪选举候选人担任公职的权利；改组旧政权镇压人民的警察、司法机构和军队，并且解散专门从事逮捕和残杀爱国民主人士的反动组织“共产党活动镇压局”。
    古巴临时政府主要是以卡斯特罗为首的“7月26日”运动所领导的起义力量为中心的权政，宣布了保证民主自由、实行土地改革和发展民族工业的政纲，执行反对美国干涉、维护国家独立的政策。古巴人民社会党（共产党）没有能够参加这个政权。但是，古巴临时政府的政纲和它所采取的一些措施，符合于古巴人民和民族的利益，因此，得到了古巴人民社会党和古巴人民的支持。至于重新建立起来的古巴武装部队，是完全以起义部队的战士为核心组织起来的，其中约有70％是农民，其余的是工人和专业人员。过去以“不忠诚”的罪名被独裁暴君拘禁起来的全部士兵都归队入伍，而旧军队中的一千零六十六名巴蒂斯塔官兵则被命令退休和退役，其中有二百人是高级军官。
    古巴新政府摧毁旧的暴政机器所获得的成果是巨大的，但是，独裁制度的社会和经济基础还没有消除，为了确保革命胜利果实和使革命继续发展，古巴人民进一步要求整顿和加强临时政府的工作；向整个旧的司法和法律领域发动进攻：废除所有镇压和反民主的法律；重新审查经济、财政和劳工方面的一切措施，以便取消和加以修改；继续逮捕和惩办巴蒂斯塔残余分子；本着工会民主、工人团结和同全世界人民团结的原则给工会以最大的自由和独立；准备制定更加民主的新宪法。
    社会和经济改革工作
    古巴临时政府成立后，在建立社会秩序和使国内生活民主化方面采取了一些积极的措施。它很快地取消了戒严令，恢复公民自由和工会权利，取消新闻检查，解散为巴蒂斯塔帮凶的反动政党，允许被反动政权宣布非法的各政党（包括古巴人民社会党在内）和团体公开活动和让政治流亡人士回国，颁布反映古巴1940年宪法原则的临时宪法，并宣布将在一年半到两年内举行自由选举。
    古巴临时政府在恢复国家经济方面，把修路、修复港口设施，保证适时收割甘蔗和恢复糖厂的生产，作为它的重要任务。现在绝大多数的糖厂恢复了生产，预计今年蔗糖的总产量将达五百八十万吨。
    实行土地改革是古巴社会和经济改革的初步措施，也是一项重要措施。卡斯特罗积极主张执行土地改革计划。他曾在2月1日亲自率领一支由二百人组成的土地改革工作突击队到奥连特省，把政府重新从大地主那里没收或收买来的土地分配给十五万无地和少地的农民。一个月以后，3月1日卡斯特罗又到西部比那尔德里奥省，把二万五千英亩的土地分配给三百四十六个农民。不过，目前的土地改革还是根据1958年11月起义部队在老根据地奥连特省颁布的“第三号法令”进行的。这项法令规定把国有土地和要收买或没收的私有土地分成二到五卡瓦里阿（一卡瓦里阿等于一三点四二公顷）大小，无偿地分配给拥有不到五卡瓦里阿土地的农民。没收大地主的荒地由政府给以补偿金，如果大地主在两年以内把这笔钱投入工业、矿业和农业的话，政府将给以免税十年的优待。根据这项法律将把占全国土地一半的土地分配给无地和少地的农民，而首先分配的是国家未耕种的土地和那些被独裁政权以极低价格非法卖给本国和外国公司的土地。可以看出，这个在武装斗争时期颁布的“第三号法令”还没有触及导致古巴贫困落后的根源之一的大庄园制度。古巴人民要求分配大庄园的土地。2月间在奥连特省省会圣地亚哥举行的农民代表会议（卡斯特罗和其他一些起义领袖也参加了这次会议）除同意“第三号法令”的土地改革基本原则外，还通过决议要求禁止大庄园制，限制外国大地产所有者和当地大庄园主所占的土地面积并把多出来的土地分配给农民。卡斯特罗表示接受这些意见，并在就任总理的演说中表示，临时政府不久将通过一项比“第三号法令”更为广泛的法律。这项法律将集中一切建议，使它能够结束大庄园制度。
    在古巴实行比较彻底的土地改革，还存在着不少障碍。首先，古巴的大地主、大牧场主和蔗糖种植者还企图阻挠目前根据“第三号法令”进行的土地改革工作，他们借口说，限制大地产者的土地会使土地分成碎块而对生产不利，要求政府只把国家占有的土地分给农民。其次，在古巴临时政府内部在如何实行土地改革的问题上也有分歧。“第三号法令”的起草人、现任农业部长索里·马林就不同意触及大庄园制度，这也是新的土地改革法到现在还没有正式公布的一个原因。
    卡斯特罗就任总理后，更集中力量处理经济问题，还考虑到通过实行工业化来解决失业问题。新政府从旧政权接收下来的遗产有许多不堪设想的困难。被巴蒂斯塔洗劫的国库几乎没有钱了，巴蒂斯塔逃跑时还带走从人民掠夺的五亿美元的巨款。在巴蒂斯塔统治的年代里，古巴的国债已高达十五亿美元。长期的内战使不少运输线和甘蔗种植园遭到破坏，公共工程陷于瘫痪，失业人数已达七十万人。由于食糖的出口价格和定额的减少，古巴经济面临严重的困难。因此，卡斯特罗在他就任总理时发表的政纲中，提出经济方面的迫切任务是：建立国家商船队，建立民族工业，改善居民特别是改善农民、工人和职员的物质状况。但是，要实现这些迫切任务，除了进一步实行彻底的土地改革以外，首先必须摆脱美国垄断资本对古巴的经济控制。大家知道，在巴蒂斯塔反动统治的年代中，美国垄断资本对古巴的直接投资已经高达十亿美元之巨，占美国对拉丁美洲国家直接投资的第三位。美国通过这些投资和巴蒂斯塔的出卖，牢牢地控制古巴的制糖、铁矿、镍矿等经济命脉和交通运输、电力、电话等公用事业。这就造成了古巴的贫困和对美国的依赖，如果不首先摆脱美国的经济控制，就很难保证古巴经济的独立发展。
    团结，警惕，继续前进
    古巴人民革命的胜利及其继续发展，引起了美帝国主义和古巴反动派的极大恐慌。他们是不甘心自己的失败的。它们竭力企图保持对古巴的政治和经济的控制，阻挡古巴革命对拉丁美洲其他国家人民斗争的深远影响。
  美帝国主义在古巴胜利的初期，曾经企图派遣军舰到古巴去进行武装干涉。后来又借口古巴处决罪恶昭彰的巴蒂斯塔分子，进行诽谤和干涉。这些阴谋活动都由于古巴人民的坚决反对和世界舆论的强烈谴责而未得逞。但是，他们并不认输，还在进行各种各样明的暗的，政治的和经济的阴谋活动，妄图迫使古巴临时政府妥协倒退。他们除了用“共产主义威胁”的老一套手法来吓唬古巴人民和分裂古巴人民的团结以外，还派遣特务渗入革命队伍，利用内阁和外交使团中没有黑人这一点，挑拨黑人同白人的关系；同时用使老兵同新兵对立以及使“7月26日”运动同左派对立的办法来分裂古巴武装部队。在经济方面则利用古巴的主要收入依靠输出食糖和美国几乎是古巴食糖的唯一市场这个弱点，威胁着要限制和减少从古巴进口食糖。此外，尽管古巴临时政府对处决巴蒂斯塔残余分子采取了坚定的态度，但是，美国多年来所豢养的古巴反动势力并没有完全肃清，在美国本土又收容了不少巴蒂斯塔分子，加上古巴距离美国很近，古巴领土上又有美国军事基地，美帝国主义就利用这些条件策动古巴内部反动分子暗杀卡斯特罗和进行颠复活动。在古巴临时政府破获的暗杀卡斯特罗的凶手中，甚至有一个是前美国海军航空队飞行员艾伦·罗伯特·奈。不止如此，最近以来，海地、多米尼加的亲美政权更在美国的指使下，无中生有地叫嚷有“来自古巴的入侵”危险，在加勒比海地区制造紧张局势，要求美国“立即采取措施”，“维护加勒比海的安全”；与此同时，美国直接帮助多米尼加建立了一支特殊的海军陆战队，美国议员公然鼓吹要美洲国家组织在加勒比海地区采取“警察行动”。美国帝国主义的针对古巴革命政权进行的这些侵略阴谋活动，已引起了古巴政府和人民的警惕。古巴总理卡斯特罗在22日哈瓦那的十万人群众大会上号召古巴人民全体动员起来为击败这种侵略阴谋而斗争。
    所有这些情况都在表明，目前古巴人民的斗争还是艰巨而复杂的。关键在于团结。古巴人民依靠团结取得了推翻独裁政权的胜利，也依靠团结狠狠地打击了美国的干涉阴谋。今后古巴人民只要继续加强团结，就一定能保卫住革命成果，击败美国的侵略阴谋。
