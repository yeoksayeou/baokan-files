Old Cotton Regions Strive to Increase Unit Yield; New Cotton Regions Ensure Completion of Expanded Cotton Planting Plans.
    Seize Every Opportunity and Intensify Cotton Field Preparation.

    (Our Report) In order to achieve the task of producing approximately 100 million dan of ginned cotton this year, cotton farmers in the old and new cotton regions across the country are actively engaged in preparing their cotton fields, and have already achieved preliminary results. According to statistics from the seven provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Anhui, 66.4% of the cotton fields have already been plowed. Among them, 85% of Shaanxi Province's 4.75 million mu of cotton fields have been deeply plowed, with some high-yield fields plowed to depths of over three chi (one meter); in Hebei Province's four major cotton-producing prefectures (cities) of Tianjin, Baoding, Handan, and Shijiazhuang, 70% of the cotton fields have undergone deep plowing to conserve moisture. Combining winter plowing and spring plowing, provinces such as Shanxi, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi have applied an average of 9,000 to 17,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cotton field, more than double that of last year; in the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Anhui, irrigated cotton fields account for over 72% of the cotton field area in these provinces.

    In some areas of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where the season is earlier, cotton sowing has already begun as preparations are completed. By the end of January, more than 80,000 mu had been sown in nine prefectures (autonomous prefectures) of Yunnan Province, including Dehong, Lijiang, Chuxiong, and Yuxi. With a spirit of seizing the opportunity early and doing a good job, cotton farmers in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, universally advanced the cotton sowing, and by the end of February, approximately 10,000 mu of cotton had been sown in the entire prefecture.

    This year, the national cotton planting area is required to expand to 100 million mu, an increase of more than 15 million mu of new cotton fields compared to last year; the average yield per mu of all cotton fields is required to reach 100 jin of ginned cotton. In order to ensure the realization of this target, various regions have carried out a series of preparatory work. Under the favorable conditions of the people's communes after communization, various regions have planned the planting area, arranged labor, and carried out organizational and material preparations. When arranging the planting area, various regions have paid great attention to the arrangement of large areas of high-yield fields. According to statistics from nine provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Hubei, the area of high-yield cotton fields is more than 20 million mu, accounting for about 30% of the planned cotton planting area, with per-mu yield requirements reaching 200 jin, 300 jin, and 500 jin of ginned cotton respectively. Baoding Prefecture in Hebei Province plans to plant 1.7 million mu of cotton, including 500,000 mu of large-area high-yield zones. Xinxiang County in Henan Province plans to plant 220,000 mu of cotton fields, striving to achieve an average yield of 300 jin per mu. These places are prepared to use large-area high-yield fields to drive the overall increase in production in general fields, in order to achieve an all-round leap forward in cotton production. Some regions have expanded the cotton planting area this year, with provinces such as Jiangxi and Hunan expanding by more than double compared to last year, and Zhejiang Province expanding by nearly double. New and old cotton regions have universally promoted the "Dai Zi Cotton" improved variety this year. In order to seize the season and increase yields, many regions have promoted nutrient pot seedling cultivation. Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei Province has prepared more than 79.65 million jin of high-quality Dai Zi No. 15 cotton seeds, enabling the entire prefecture's 4 million mu of cotton fields to be planted with improved varieties. More than a month ago, the Jiefang People's Commune in Shanghai County used nutrient pots to cultivate more than 17,000 cotton seedlings. Some of the existing seedlings have germinated, and some have grown to more than one cun (3.3cm) high. In Xichong County, Sichuan, cotton seedlings cultivated in greenhouses have grown two true leaves.

    This year, many places have also trained a large number of cotton planting technicians. At the end of last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture opened a cotton planting technology training class for more than 480 people, and county-level training classes were subsequently opened. Zhao Kejin, the First Secretary of the Anyue County Party Committee in Sichuan Province, personally led cadres and commune technicians to hold mobile on-site training classes in the communes with high cotton yields last year, popularizing cotton planting technology to communes, teams, and the vast number of commune members, so that everyone knows the technology and everyone can do it. As early as the cotton harvest last year, the Nanchong Prefecture in Sichuan Province organized cadres from various counties to learn advanced experience in high-yield cotton areas, and in December last year, transferred technical cadres to Hubei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and other places to learn experience in high-yield cotton production.

    The cotton yield increase measures proposed by various regions this year are more detailed and solid than in previous years. Hebei Province has proposed that cotton should have three increases (increase fruit branches, increase cotton bolls, increase boll weight), three preventions (prevent disease, prevent insects, prevent bud and boll abscission), and one promotion (promote high yield and early maturity). Hubei Province has proposed ten measures to be mastered for cotton (fertilizer, water, light, protection, early, planting, completeness, soil, seed, density).

    Various regions have paid attention to strengthening the leadership in cotton production. This year, Hubei Province has proposed that the special district, county and township should still be responsible for cotton production by one secretary. Shandong Province has proposed that counties with 400,000 mu of cotton fields should be responsible for cotton production by one secretary, one county head and several county party committee members; counties with 200,000 mu of cotton fields should be responsible for cotton production by one county party committee secretary and several county party committee members; and counties with 100,000 mu of cotton fields should be led by one county head and one county party committee member. In addition to the division of responsibilities by leading cadres, professional teams should also be established for cotton field management, so that every mu of cotton field is responsible from planting to harvesting, striving for high yields per mu and bumper harvests per plot.

    In order to make the preparation work better, at present, all regions are further strengthening the preparation of cotton fields. (Attached pictures)

    老棉区千方百计提高单位产量　新棉区保证完成扩大植棉计划
    不失一天时机  抓紧棉田备耕
    本报讯　为了实现今年生产皮棉一亿担左右的任务，全国老棉区和新棉区的棉农们，积极地展开了棉田备耕工作，并已取得了初步的成绩。据河北、山东、山西、河南、湖北、陕西、安徽七省的统计，已耕的棉田达到66.4％。其中陕西省四百七十五万亩棉田，有85％已经深耕，有些高产田深耕在三尺以上；河北省的天津、保定、邯郸、石家庄等四个主要产棉专区（市），深耕保墒的棉田达到70％。山西、江苏、四川、陕西等省结合冬耕和春耕，棉田平均每亩积肥已达九千到一万七千斤，超过去年一倍多；河北、山西、河南、陕西、安徽五省已灌溉的棉田占这些省棉田面积的72％以上。
    在季节较早的云南、四川省的部分地区，准备工作就绪的已开始了棉花播种。云南省德宏、丽江、楚雄和玉溪等九个专区（自治州），在1月底就播种了八万多亩。四川省内江专区的棉农以抓早、抓好的精神，普遍提早了棉花播种，到2月下旬，全区已有一万亩左右的棉花下了种。
    今年全国棉花的种植面积要求扩大到一亿亩，比去年扩大新棉田一千五百多万亩；要求全部棉田平均亩产百斤皮棉。各地为了保证这一指标的实现，进行了一系列的准备工作。各地在人民公社化后的有利条件下，规划了播种面积，安排了劳动力，进行了组织准备和物质准备。各地在安排播种面积的时候，非常注意大面积丰产田的安排。河北、山西、河南、陕西、山东、安徽、江苏、四川、湖北等九省统计，棉花丰产田面积有两千多万亩，占计划种植棉田的30％左右，亩产要求分别达到皮棉二百斤、三百斤、五百斤。河北省保定专区计划种植一百七十万亩棉花，其中有五十万亩大面积丰产方，河南省新乡县计划种植二十二万亩棉田，平均亩产争取达到三百斤。这些地方准备用大面积丰产田来带动一般田普遍增产，以实现棉花生产的全面跃进。有的地区今年扩大了棉花的种植面积，江西、湖南等省都比去年扩大一倍以上，浙江省扩大了近一倍。新老棉区今年普遍地推广了“岱字棉”良种，为了抢季节，提高产量，不少地区推广了营养钵育苗。河北省石家庄专区已备妥优良岱字十五号棉种七千九百六十五万多斤，使全区四百万亩棉田良种化。上海县解放人民公社在一个多月前用营养钵培育的一万七千多棵棉苗，现有的已发芽，有的已长一寸多高。四川西充县采用温室培育的棉苗已生长出两片真叶。
    许多地方，今年还培养了大批的植棉技术手。浙江省农业厅在去年年底就开办了四百八十多人的植棉技术训练班，随后各县也开办了训练班。四川省安岳县委第一书记赵科进亲自率领干部和公社的技术员到去年棉花高产的社举办流动现场训练班，把植棉技术普遍到社、队和广大社员，做到技术人人皆知，个个能做。四川省南充专区早在去年收棉时就组织各县干部到高产棉区学习先进经验，同时在去年12月抽调技术干部到湖北、山东、河南、山西等地方，学习棉花丰产经验。
    今年各地提出的棉花增产措施都比往年细致、扎实。河北省提出了棉花要三增（增果枝、增棉铃、增铃重）、三防（防病、防虫、防蕾铃脱落）、一促进（促进丰产早熟）。湖北省提出棉花要掌握的十项措施（肥、水、光、保、早、栽、全、土、种、密）。
    在棉花的生产领导上，各地都注意加强了。今年湖北省已提出专、县、乡仍由一个书记负责棉花生产。山东省提出有四十万亩棉田的县，由一个书记、一个县长和几个县委委员负责棉花生产；有二十万亩棉田的县，由一个县委书记和几个县委委员负责棉花生产；有十万亩棉田的县，由一个县长和一个县委委员领导。除领导干部分工负责外，在棉田管理上还应成立专业队，做到每一块每一亩棉田从种到收都有专人负责，力争亩亩高产，块块丰收。
    为了使准备工作做的更好，目前，各地正在进一步地加强棉田备耕工作。（附图片）
