Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 14th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress on the 12th, requesting Congress to allocate $3,929 million for so-called foreign "aid" in the 1960 fiscal year (July 1, 1959, to June 30, 1960).

    The message pointed out that, as in the past, in the 1960 fiscal year, the U.S. government still plans to use the vast majority of its foreign "aid" for military purposes. The message said that direct military "aid" alone would reach $1.6 billion this year, accounting for 40% of the entire "foreign aid" appropriation. Under the guise of the so-called Sino-Soviet "threat," especially the so-called "Berlin crisis," the message clamored that the United States should "provide essential conventional weapons and ammunition, highly sophisticated electronic equipment, missiles, and other new weapons" to the troops of its military allies. The message also specifically pointed out that while the United States is urging its military allies to step up the arms race and prevent the military blocs cobbled together by the United States from "seriously deteriorating," it will strive to establish U.S. missile bases in these countries.

    The message said that the indirect military assistance of the United States in the 1960 fiscal year, also known as "defense support costs," will be more than $830 million, of which more than two-thirds will be given to South Vietnam, South Korea, Turkey, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, and about one-third will be given to Greece, Iran, Spain, Pakistan, Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and other countries. The message said that the purpose of this "aid" from the United States is to enable the recipient authorities to maintain the "forces that the United States hopes they will maintain" and make "valuable contributions" to U.S. military plans.

    The message also suggested allocating $272.2 million as "special assistance" to some countries that the United States considers to be of "great strategic importance."

    The message expressed great concern about the vigorously developing national independence movements in the world and worried that the great achievements of the socialist countries would become a "model of progress," a "path to economic equality," and a "trend of the future."

    The message said that the United States will adopt more "economic aid" and "technical assistance" means in guiding the "nationalist enthusiasm" of nationally independent countries toward so-called "beneficial goals," that is to say, to use this kind of "aid" with political conditions as bait to achieve the purpose of the United States interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, infiltrating these countries, and establishing U.S. colonial influence.

    Eisenhower's "foreign aid" plan was proposed under the circumstances that the U.S.'s past "foreign aid" plans have failed, and there is widespread doubt in the United States as to whether "foreign aid" truly "wins friends."

    艾森豪威尔提出“援外”特别咨文
    主张继续靠“援外”援美
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔12日向国会提出特别咨文，要求国会拨出三十九亿二千九百余万美元在1960财政年度（1959年7月1日到1960年6月30日）进行所谓对外“援助”。
    咨文指出，像过去一样，在1960财政年度里，美国政府仍然计划把绝大部分的对外“援助”用在军事方面。咨文说，这一年单是直接军事“援助”就将达十六亿美元，占整个“援外”拨款的40％。咨文在所谓中苏“威胁”、特别是所谓“柏林危机”的幌子下叫嚷说，美国要向它的军事盟国的部队“提供不可缺少的常规武器和弹药、极复杂的电子装备、导弹和其他新式武器”。咨文还特别指出，在美国驱策它的军事盟国加紧进行军备竞赛，防止美国拼凑的军事集团“严重败坏”的时候，将要竭力在这些国家建立美国的导弹基地。
    咨文说，美国在1960财政年度的间接军事援助，也就是所谓“防御支持费用”将是八亿三千多万美元，其中三分之二以上将给予南越、南朝鲜、土耳其和台湾蒋介石集团，约三分之一将给予希腊、伊朗、西班牙、巴基斯坦、泰国、老挝、菲律宾等国。咨文说，美国这种“援助”的目的是要使受“援”当局维持美国“希望它们维持的部队”，对美国的军事计划作出“有价值的贡献”。
    咨文还建议拨出二亿七千二百万美元作为“特别援助”，给予一些美国认为在战略上有“极大重要性”的国家。
    咨文对当前世界蓬勃发展的民族独立运动表示很大的忧虑，同时担心社会主义阵营各国的巨大成就会成为“进步的典范”、“走向经济平等的道路”和“未来的潮流”。
    咨文说，美国在把民族独立国家的“民族主义热情”导向所谓“有益的目的”方面将要更多地采取“经济援助”和“技术援助”的手段，也就是说要用这种带有政治条件的“援助”作为诱饵，以达到美国干涉这些国家的内政，渗入这些国家和建立美国的殖民势力的目的。
    艾森豪威尔这个“援外”计划是在美国过去的“对外援助”计划遭到失败，美国国内对“援外”是不是真正“赢得朋友”这一点普遍表示怀疑的情况下提出的。
