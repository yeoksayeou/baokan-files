Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Conscientiously do a good job in short-distance commodity transportation, thoroughly and deeply carry out straight-line transportation, and ensure that commodities are transported from purchasing points to supply points in the least amount of time, the shortest mileage, and the least expense. This is a central task determined by the National Storage and Transportation Work Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Commerce.

During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian and Minister of Commerce Cheng Zihua spoke on the issue of short-distance transportation and straight-line transportation, respectively.

The meeting held that in 1959, national industrial and agricultural production would achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and the volume of social commodity circulation would inevitably expand accordingly. The procurement volume of agricultural and sideline products and the supply volume of production and living materials would also increase considerably. This would bring very heavy tasks to the commodity storage and transportation departments. To complete this task, the storage and transportation departments must implement the policy of "the whole nation as a chessboard," first ensuring the transportation of materials related to national needs and export commodities, and striving to comprehensively complete the transportation tasks of materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.

The meeting pointed out that doing a good job in short-distance transportation is an important link in smoothly completing the task of commodity allocation. After the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the realization of people's communes nationwide, many changes have taken place in the situation of short-distance transportation. Due to the tremendous development of industrial and agricultural production, products are more abundant than in the past, and short-distance transportation has lagged far behind the needs of production development. This is the most fundamental reason for the current shortage of short-distance transportation capacity. At the same time, in the past, agricultural cooperatives used the slack winter and spring seasons to organize members to engage in specialized or sideline transportation. Now, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, agricultural activities are also very busy in the winter and spring seasons, so this type of transportation has decreased. In the past, market towns played a role in distributing materials, but this role has been greatly reduced as commercial institutions have extended into rural areas for direct procurement and supply. A large number of small merchants and peddlers have shifted to agricultural production, and their past role in short-distance transportation has also decreased. The meeting believes that the fundamental way to solve the problem of insufficient short-distance transportation capacity is to rely on people's communes to run transportation and rely on people's communes to uniformly arrange the transportation capacity and labor required for short-distance transportation. Commercial departments should assist people's communes in planning transportation while planning production and commodity circulation; and they should also assist communes in establishing professional transportation teams to develop them towards specialization, regularization, and institutionalization. When commercial departments sign procurement and supply contracts with communes, they must include short-distance transportation as a content, clearly stipulating the time and place of material handover and freight charges, so that the responsibilities borne by both parties are determined in the form of a contract. However, it will take a certain development process for people's communes to bear all short-distance transportation tasks. Even communes that have already established professional transportation teams will still experience insufficient transportation capacity during busy agricultural seasons. Therefore, commercial departments can establish a certain number of transportation teams to make up for the shortage of short-distance transportation capacity of transportation departments and people's communes.

Another important link in doing a good job in commodity circulation is to comprehensively and deeply carry out straight-line transportation of commodities and overcome unreasonable phenomena such as multiple links, complicated procedures, and roundabout counter-current in the circulation process. This work is not only related to production and supply, but also directly related to improving the operation and management of commercial departments. At present, transportation costs account for more than 30% of the entire commodity circulation cost. If transportation costs are saved by a few percentage points, it would amount to hundreds of millions of yuan. At the same time, it is also of great significance for accelerating capital turnover and saving transportation capacity and labor. After the experience of straight-line transportation created by the commercial departments of Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province and Xinyang Prefecture in Henan Province was promoted nationwide last year, great achievements have been made. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces and cities, the amount of commodities transported by straight-line transportation reached 7.8 million tons in the second half of last year, saving 74 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity, shortening the time of commodities in transit by three to twenty days, and saving nearly 50 million yuan in transportation expenses. However, from a national perspective, this work has not been carried out widely and deeply enough, and its development is also uneven. Phenomena such as roundabout transportation and opposite transportation still exist to varying degrees. The meeting decided to comprehensively and deeply carry out straight-line transportation work this year, and strive to basically realize the direct transportation of commodities before National Day. The main methods for doing a good job in straight-line transportation are: breaking down administrative divisions and rationally organizing transportation according to economic divisions; removing unnecessary intermediate links, and commodities that are allocated from top to bottom and have direct delivery and direct allocation conditions (such as chemical fertilizers, large agricultural implements, power machinery, coal, etc.) can be directly transported from the place of origin to the supply point without going through any intermediate links; grassroots outlets that operate daily-use industrial products, if they are close to secondary wholesale stations, can bypass the county wholesale link and directly purchase goods from secondary stations; agricultural and sideline products should be directly transported to railway stations, docks or factories whenever possible, without going through the commercial warehouse link. In order to organize commodity circulation more scientifically, commercial transportation departments should comprehensively plan transportation routes, make rational flow charts, and operate according to the charts.

The meeting emphasized that whether it is short-distance transportation or straight-line transportation, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, and closely cooperate with all parties.

In addition, the meeting also discussed issues such as strengthening the planned management of transportation work, vigorously carrying out technical revolution in storage and transportation departments, strengthening the maintenance of commodities, and ensuring the safety of materials.

### 用最少时间　走最短里程　花最省费用  大抓短途运输和直线运输  储运工作会议根据“全国一盘棋”方针安排商品调运

    用最少时间　走最短里程　花最省费用
    大抓短途运输和直线运输
    储运工作会议根据“全国一盘棋”方针安排商品调运
    新华社25日讯　认真做好商品的短途运输工作，全面深入地开展直线运输，保证以最少的时间、走最短的里程、花最省的费用，把商品从收购点运到供应点。这是商业部最近召开的全国储运工作会议确定的一项中心任务。
    会议期间，国务院副总理李先念、商业部长程子华分别就短途运输和直线运输问题讲了话。
    会议认为，1959年全国工农业生产将要更大、更好、更全面地跃进，社会商品流通量必将随之扩大，农副产品的收购量和生产、生活资料的供应量也将有相当大的增长，这样就给商品保管、调运部门带来了十分繁重的任务。要完成这一任务，储运工作部门必须贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，首先保证与全国需要有关的物资和出口商品的运输，力争全面地完成与工农业生产和人民生活所需的物资的运输任务。
  会议指出，做好短途运输是顺利地完成商品调运任务的一个重要环节。在工农业生产大跃进和全国实现人民公社化以后，短途运输的情况发生了很多变化。由于工农业生产的巨大发展，产品比之过去更加丰富，短途运输已远远赶不上生产发展的需要，这是当前短途运输力量不足问题的最根本原因。同时，过去农业社利用冬闲、春闲组织社员从事专业或副业运输，现在由于农业生产大跃进，冬春季节的农事也很繁忙，因而这类运输减少了；过去集镇所起的物资疏运作用，由于商业机构伸入农村直接收购和供应，这种作用也大为缩小；小商小贩大批转入农业生产，他们过去所起的短途运输作用也减少了。会议认为，解决短途运输力量不足问题的根本途径是依靠人民公社办运输，依靠人民公社统一安排短途运输所需的运力、劳力。商业部门要协助人民公社在规划生产和商品流通的同时，也要对运输进行规划；并且要协助公社建立运输专业队伍，使它向专业化、经常化、制度化的方向发展。商业部门在与公社签订收购、供应合同时，必须把短途运输作为一项内容列进去，明确规定物资交接的时间、地点和运费，使双方应负的责任用合同形式确定下来。但是短途运输任务全部由人民公社负担起来还需要一定的发展过程，即使已经建立专业运输队的公社，在农业繁忙时期，仍会发生运力不足的情况，因此商业部门可以建立一定数量的运输队伍，以弥补交通运输部门和人民公社短途运输力量的不足。
    做好商品流转工作的另一个重要环节是全面深入地开展商品的直线运输，克服流转过程中环节多、手续繁、迂回对流等不合理现象。这一工作不仅关系到生产和供应，而且与改善商业部门的经营管理直接有关。目前运输费用占整个商品流通费用的30％以上，如果节约运费百分之几，就是上亿元资金，同时对于加速资金周转、节约运力、劳力也有十分重要的意义。去年河北省唐山专区和河南省信阳专区商业部门创造的直线运输的经验在全国推广后，已经取得了很大成绩，根据十二个省、市的不完全统计，去年下半年直线运输的商品达七百八十万吨，节省运力七千四百万吨公里，缩短商品在途时间三天到二十天，节约运费开支近五千万元。但是从全国范围来看，这一工作开展得还不够广泛、深入，发展也不平衡，迂回运输、相向运输等现象还是不同程度地存在着。会议决定在今年内要把直线运输工作全面、深入地开展起来，争取在国庆节前基本实现商品直运化。做好直线运输的主要办法是：打破行政区划，按经济区划合理组织运输；去掉不必要的中间环节，凡自上而下分配并且有直达、直拨条件的商品（如化肥、大型农具、动力机械、煤炭等）可以由起运地直运供应点，中间不经过任何环节；经营日用工业品的基层点，如靠近二级批发站，可以越过县批发环节直接向二级站进货；农副产品凡有条件的都应直接运到车站、码头或工厂，不经商业仓库这个环节。为了更科学地组织商品流转，商业运输部门应当全面地规划运输路线，作出合理流向图表，按照图表进行作业。
    会议强调指出，不论短途运输或直线运输都必须依靠党的领导、充分发动群众、密切与各方面协作。
    此外，会议对加强运输工作的计划管理、在储运部门大闹技术革命、加强商品的养护和确保物资安全等问题也进行了讨论。
