New Factories Can Also Write Factory History
    史梓铭

    Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is a new factory with a high degree of mechanization and complex technology. It was built under the leadership of the Party, through the hard work and selfless labor of the builders, overcoming all kinds of difficulties. Its commissioning marks a new stage in the development of the machinery industry, demonstrating that our country can independently produce heavy machine tools to equip construction needs, and at the same time, take on the responsibility of cultivating technical forces for the production of heavy machine tools.

    We had also thought that writing the factory history of such a factory that rose from the ground, from scratch, would be very educational for the workers. In late June of last year, people from the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association came and suggested that we learn from the factory history written by the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and write our factory history. Most of the comrades in the factory Party committee agreed. However, some individuals believed that the Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory was an old factory with a rich history of struggle, and there were many old workers, so they could produce rich materials for comparing the past and the present. Our new factory has a short history, with many new workers and few old workers, not many materials, and nothing to write about; some said, if we write the history of the factory's construction, the people who prepared for the factory's construction are all here, and we can understand it by talking about it; if we write about production, we can't write anything significant just after starting production. Some also said that the workers have a low level of education and poor writing skills, so if we want to write, we should have people from the Writers Association come and we will provide some materials, and some even emphasized that the production tasks are heavy, we are too busy, and we will write later when we have time. Such ideas show that some people do not fully understand the role and purpose of writing factory history, limiting the writing of factory history to a small circle of people, and not recognizing that factory history is the history of the struggle of the working people, that laborers create society and create everything, that working people established the factory, and can write rich content; to write the factory history, it is not enough to rely on one or two writers. Some also juxtapose writing factory history with the current production tasks, believing that writing factory history is troublesome for the workers and will hinder production.

    The Party committee criticized the above views, unified everyone's thinking, and unanimously believed that new factories have new characteristics, and new factories can also write factory history. Because we implemented the central government's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in construction, and we have gone through the exploratory process of construction and production at the same time, the progress of the factory construction can be considered very fast, and there will be a lot to write about. The question is whether we can mobilize the masses of workers. The factory Party committee particularly pointed out that the factory workers have entered the great rectification movement, and their political consciousness and production enthusiasm have been significantly improved, which makes it easier for us to carry out this work; writing factory history should be closely combined with rectification and production. Immediately, it was decided to establish a committee to lead the writing of the factory history; the Party committee secretary took the lead, and several cadres were also assigned. Then, in-depth ideological mobilization was carried out within the Party organization, explaining the purpose of writing factory history and widely mobilizing the masses of workers to write together. We want to improve the workers' class consciousness through writing factory history, promote the great leap forward in production and the development of technological and cultural revolutions, and solve the labor attitude problems of some workers; through writing factory history, we can cultivate a team of amateur worker writers and lay a good foundation for the factory's literary and artistic activities. Therefore, we have consistently implemented the practice of fully mobilizing the masses from beginning to end, making the writing of factory history deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and creating a mass movement. After two months, we have achieved good results, the workers have widely conducted a class self-education, mobilized the masses, boosted their morale, and promoted the leap forward in production. In a short period of time, more than 300 manuscripts have been written, totaling more than 600,000 words, and truly vivid and valuable manuscripts have been written. More than 80% of the manuscripts come from workers who have never written articles before. Among the manuscripts are those from apprentices, veteran workers, molders, lathe, fitter, milling, planer workers, crane operators... etc., truly achieving writing one's own history with one's own hands.

    新厂也能编写工厂史
    史梓铭
    武汉重型机床厂是座机械化程度很高、技术复杂的新工厂。它是在党的领导下，建设者们经过艰苦奋斗，忘我的劳动，克服了种种困难而建成的。它的投入生产，标志着机械工业发展走上了新的阶段，说明了我国能独立生产重型机床，来装备建设上的需要，同时又能负起培养生产重型机床的技术力量。
    我们也曾想过，把这样一座平地而起从无到有的厂子的厂史写出来，对职工们是很有教育意义的。去年6月下旬中国作家协会武汉分会来人建议我们向天津棉纺三厂编写的厂史学习，把我厂厂史写出来。厂党委多数同志是赞成的。但也有个别同志认为棉纺三厂是老厂，斗争历史丰富，老工人又多，能搞出今昔对比的丰富资料。而我们这个新厂历史不长，新工人多老工人少，资料不多，没有什么写头；有的说，写建厂史吗，筹建厂的人都在，谈谈就明白了；写生产吗，刚生产也写不出个名堂来。有的又说工人文化程度低，写作能力差，要写还是作家协会来人，我们提供些资料，有的还强调生产任务重，忙不过来，以后有时间再写吧。诸如此类的思想，说明了有些人对写厂史的作用、目的全面了解不够，把写厂史局限在少数人的圈子里，没有认识到厂史是劳动人民的斗争史，劳动者创造了社会，创造了一切，劳动人民创建了工厂，就能写出内容丰富的文字；要写出厂史，光靠一二位作家是不行的。有的还把写厂史和当前生产任务对立起来，认为写厂史是找职工麻烦，会妨碍生产。
    党委批判了上述的看法，统一了大家的思想，一致认为新厂有新厂的特点，新厂也能写出厂史来。因为我们在建厂中贯彻了中央多快好省的路线，我们经过边建设边生产的摸索过程，建厂进度也算是很快的，可写的东西也会不少。问题是能否把职工群众发动起来。厂党委特别指出：厂职工进入伟大的整风运动，政治觉悟与生产积极性有了显著的提高，更便于我们开展这一工作；写厂史要紧紧和整风生产密切结合起来。随即决定成立了领导编写厂史的委员会；党委书记挂帅，还选配了几名干部。接着从党组织中进行深入思想动员，说明了写厂史的目的，广泛动员职工群众大家来写。我们想通过写厂史提高工人的阶级觉悟，促进生产大跃进和技术革命、文化革命的发展，解决某些工人的劳动态度问题；通过写厂史培养出一支工人业余写作队伍，为厂的文艺活动打下个良好基础。因此我们自始至终贯穿着充分发动群众的做法，把写厂史深入人心，造成群众运动。经过两个月时间，已获得良好的成果，职工中广泛地进行了一次阶级自我教育，发动了群众，鼓足了干劲，促进了生产的跃进，短期内写有三百多篇稿子，达六十多万字，确实写出了生动可取的文稿。80％以上文稿是来自从未写过文章的工人群众中。文稿中有徒工们的，有老师傅的，有造型工的，有车、钳、铣、刨工的，有开吊车工的……等，真正做到用自己的手，写自己的历史。
