Spring thunder roars, the earth revives, and in the pits of the Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi, the drums of a greater leap forward beat even louder than the spring thunder.

Who was the first to beat the drums of this battle for coal? It was Zeng Dashun, a young Communist Party member from the third mining district, once known as a coal mining expert. People may remember that last spring, he was also the first to beat the drums of competition, creating a new record of 98.2 tons of coal produced by one shift, sparking a production upsurge throughout the mine to catch up with Zeng Dashun. This year, although Zeng Dashun has become the production team leader, unexpectedly, he is the one who beat the first drum again.

That day, Zeng Dashun arrived at the entrance of the mine at four o'clock in the morning. He was determined to ask the district chief to let him pick up a pneumatic drill and mine a shift of coal himself. When the duty district chief, Peng Zusheng, arrived, Zeng Dashun earnestly said, "Today, I want to be a pneumatic drill coal miner and mine a shift of coal to compete with everyone." After considering it, Chief Peng nodded and said, "Okay! How many props do you plan to mine?" Zeng Dashun said: "I'll mine twenty props!" At the shift meeting, Chief Peng introduced the fact that Team Leader Zeng requested to mine twenty props to compete with everyone. Immediately, a chorus of voices announcing battle plans sounded in the shift room, foreshadowing a major battle about to begin!

Before the shift whistle blew, people rushed into the mine with their tools. As soon as Zeng Dashun entered the shift, he patted the shoulders of the haulage worker Liang Shisheng and the coal shoveler Zhou Mingjie and carefully instructed them. Liang Shisheng said, "Rest assured and mine! We guarantee our cooperation!" Zeng Dashun picked up the pneumatic drill and lunged at the coal seam, adopting the top-down mining method, erecting a prop after mining each one. Half the time had passed, and Zeng Dashun had mined exactly ten props. However, he then changed his plan and wanted to mine twenty-four props.

By the time the shift ended, Zeng Dashun had finally mined twenty-four props, producing 110 tons of coal.

The competition did not end. After Zeng Dashun beat the first drum this spring, the drums beat louder and louder. The next day, Communist Party member Li Wenyi came earlier than usual. He thought, "Team Leader Zeng has such great enthusiasm, picking up the pneumatic drill and mining twenty-four props in one shift. We, who use the pneumatic drill every day, are falling behind him, which is unacceptable! We must catch up with him today!" He selected several long and sharp pneumatic drill bits, and went down the mine early with several small workers. That day, he used a cyclical operation method, and mined even faster. The small workers Duan Fulin and Lin Yisheng shoveled coal non-stop, without even stretching their backs. At the end of the shift, Li Wenyi mined twenty-seven props, producing 120 tons of coal, surpassing Zeng Dashun.

The pneumatic drill worker Yang Youcai, seeing that Li Wenyi had surpassed Zeng Dashun, felt very uneasy: "If others can surpass him, I have the same two hands, why can't I surpass him?" He was determined to not only surpass Zeng Dashun, but also surpass Li Wenyi. On the third day, he discussed with the small workers Lin Wenjin and Zeng Xianwen, and using the method of staggered mining, ensured that the small workers had coal to shovel for eight hours, without any downtime for either side. However, because the working conditions were somewhat difficult that day, they only mined eighteen props, producing 90 tons of coal, failing to catch up with Zeng Dashun and Li Wenyi.

Revolutionary enthusiasm is growing stronger and stronger. Although Yang Youcai has not yet caught up with Zeng Dashun and Li Wenyi, he was not discouraged, and was determined to catch up. Now, not only Yang Youcai wants to catch up with Li Wenyi, but more pneumatic drill workers have also made this ambitious aspiration. As the thunder of this spring just started, and the war drums just sounded, the battle in the mine has only just begun. Who will be the one being chased in the competition, no one dares to say now, only let these coal miners, who will forever be called heroes, give the answer themselves!

    春雷动战鼓响
    江西萍乡煤矿　王崇鼎
    春雷一声，大地回春，在高坑矿矿井里，更大跃进的战鼓却擂得比春雷更响。
    是谁第一声擂起这一场为煤而战的战鼓呢？就是回采三区的青年共产党员、曾被称为采煤能手的曾大舜。人们该会记得，去年的春天，也是他第一个擂起竞赛的战鼓，首创一班产煤九十八点二吨的新纪录，在全矿掀起了一个追赶曾大舜的生产热潮。今年，曾大舜虽已担任生产组长了，可是，想不到这第一声战鼓又是他擂响的。
  那一天，曾大舜早上四点钟就到了井口进班室，他拿定主意，一定要向区长要求一下：让他拿起风镐，亲自采一班煤。值班区长彭祖生来了，曾大舜很恳切的说：“今天我要求担任一个风镐采煤工，采一班煤和大家比比武。”彭区长考虑了一下，点点头说：“行！你打算采几根杠子呢？”曾大舜说：
  “我就采二十根杠子吧！”在进班会上，彭区长把曾组长要求采二十根杠子和大家比武的事介绍了一遍，即时，进班室里响起了一片争先恐后的宣布战斗计划的声音，它预告着一场大战就要开始了！
    进班汽笛还没有鸣，人们就拿着工具匆匆下井。曾大舜一进班，就拍拍拖料工梁石生和铲煤工周明杰的肩膀仔细叮嘱了一番。梁石生说：“你放心采吧！我们保证配合！”曾大舜拿起风镐，就向煤层猛扑过去，他采用了从上而下的采法，采完一根杠子，就架起一个棚子。时间过去一半，曾大舜恰好采了十根杠子。可是，他又变更了计划，要采二十四根杠子。
    到出班的时候，曾大舜终于采完了二十四根杠子，产煤一百一十吨。
    竞赛并没有结束。曾大舜擂起今春第一声战鼓后，战鼓越擂越响了。第二天，共产党员李文义比平日来得更早，他想：“曾组长都这么大的干劲，拿起风镐一班采了二十四根杠子。我们天天拿风镐的人反落在他后面，这还行？一定要在今天赶上他！”他选了几根又长又尖的风镐钎子，和几个小工提前下井了。这天，他运用循环作业的办法，真的采得更快，小工段福林和林义生，手不停歇的铲着煤，连腰都没有伸一下。下班时，李文义采完了二十七根杠子，产煤一百二十吨，超过了曾大舜。
    风镐工杨友才，看到李文义超过了曾大舜，心里很不平静：“人家能超过，我同样是两只手，为什么不能超过？”他下定决心不但要超过曾大舜，而且要超过李文义。第三日，他同小工林文金和曾现文商量好，利用上下交错采煤的办法，做到了小工八小时都有煤铲，两下互不窝工。但是，这天因为工作面条件有些困难，只采到十八根杠子，产煤九十吨，没有赶上曾大舜和李文义。
    革命的干劲是越鼓越足的，杨友才虽然还没有赶上曾大舜和李文义，可他并没有泄气，下定决心要赶上去。现在，不仅是杨友才要赶上李文义，还有更多的风镐工也都立下了这个壮志雄心。今春的雷声刚动，战鼓刚响，矿井里的战斗还只是开始，到底谁是竞赛中的被追赶者，现在谁也不敢说，只有让这些永远被称为英雄好汉的煤矿工人自己来做答案！
