Xinhua News Agency, London, March 26th. The 26th Congress of the British Communist Party will open tomorrow.

More than 500 delegates from all over Britain will attend the four-day congress held at St. Pancras Town Hall in London.

The Chairman of the British Communist Party, Gallacher, will preside over the Congress.

The fraternal parties of the Soviet Union, China, Hungary, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, France, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, India, Australia, Canada, Northern Ireland, Italy, Czechoslovakia and the Republic of Ireland have decided to send representatives to the congress.

The main items on the agenda include: General Secretary Gollan's political report, Organization Department Minister Lochlann's report on the draft program and constitution of the British Communist Party, and a special report on the party newspaper "The Daily Worker" by Party Political Committee member and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the "The Daily Worker", Matthews.

British Communist Party Vice-Chairman Dutt will present an urgent proposal on African issues. The meeting will also discuss a number of other proposals put forward by various departments of the party and district committees.

This congress is being held at a time when more and more Britons are beginning to see their illusions about the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties shattered. Many people are looking for new ways to escape the threat of nuclear war and the onslaught of economic recession. There is a strong feeling that it is necessary to fight for peace and employment.
