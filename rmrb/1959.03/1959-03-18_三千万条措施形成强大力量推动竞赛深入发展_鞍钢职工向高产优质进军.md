Anshan, March 17th (reported by this newspaper) – Based on summing up the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the dozens of production plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) recently universally organized the broad masses of workers to earnestly discuss the production tasks assigned to Angang by the state. Through discussion, the conviction of resolutely completing the annual steel production plan and vigorously supporting the whole country has taken root in the minds of every worker. The tens of millions of measures proposed by the workers in the discussion have formed a powerful driving force, promoting the in-depth development of the “high production, high quality, multiple variety” red flag competition that has already been launched.

This year, the steel production tasks undertaken by Angang are extremely arduous. The output of several major products—coke, pig iron, steel, and steel materials—is much higher than last year. Moreover, the state requires the production of "good iron, good steel, steel to become usable materials, and materials to be of many varieties.” Before starting the discussion of the national plan, cadres and workers in various factories and mines, combined with summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, earnestly studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. As a result, their ideological awareness was greatly improved, and they clearly recognized that whether Angang can complete this year's steel production plan not only relates to the completion of the national steel output plan of 18 million tons, but also affects the speed of national economic construction. Therefore, after the factory and mine leaders announced this year's planned targets, the broad masses of workers showed great enthusiasm, expressing their determination to summon greater efforts, vigorously improve operational techniques, and strive to complete the production tasks given by the state ahead of schedule. In the first two days of discussing the plan, the workers of the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill put forward more than 3,600 rationalization proposals, and quickly implemented more than 1,100 of them, creating favorable conditions for the plant to realize its plan of "one plant becoming two plants" before the end of April.

In the discussion of the national plan, the workers, through finding key problems, grasping measures, and carefully accounting, not only enhanced their confidence in completing the leap forward plan; but also, through tapping potential, many workers raised the product output targets assigned by the state. The steel production task of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant this year is 1.9 million tons, with an average monthly output of 160,000 tons. At the beginning of the discussion, some workers believed that it would be difficult to complete such a high monthly output. Later, after discussion, the example of producing 163,000 tons in October last year was found and analyzed, and the favorable conditions for realizing the plan were found; after further careful accounting and tapping potential, the workers put forward a leap forward plan that was 100,000 tons higher than the national plan. The original annual output plan of the Medium Rolling Mill was 700,000 tons. After discussion by the workers, they proposed a goal of ensuring 750,000 tons and striving for 800,000 tons this year. The assembly section of the Electric Repair Plant, which is responsible for the repair and fitting tasks of Angang's production plants and mines, found 67 loopholes in the discussion of the plan that wasted labor, and proposed many ways to save labor. In this way, not only can this year's production tasks be completed without increasing personnel, but also part of the labor force can be transferred to support other factories and mines.

In the discussion of the plan, all factories and mines put forward the slogan of “discussing, experimenting, and implementing simultaneously,” and actively guided the masses of workers to work hard and cleverly, improve operations, strengthen collaboration, and vigorously attack key production technologies, thus effectively promoting current production and significantly improving the output and quality of steel products. In the discussion of the plan, the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill timely summarized and promoted the advanced soaking furnace experience of Li Changchun's group of the No. 4 Soaking Furnace, and the time for firing steel was shortened in 38 furnaces within three days. In order to solve key problems such as the furnace head water jacket fire barrier, all the workers of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace (Youth Friendship Furnace) of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant contributed ideas and suggestions while discussing the plan, and carried out experiments. As a result, the phenomenon of water jacket fire barrier was quickly eliminated. In this way, the workers of the entire furnace not only formulated a leap forward plan to increase production by 12,200 tons compared with the national plan, but also improved the production in February day by day, completing the monthly steel production plan 24 hours ahead of schedule.

Now, all factories and mines have ended the work of discussing the national plan. More than 100,000 workers of Angang are taking practical actions to complete daily, ten-day, and monthly plans, and are confidently investing in the “high production, high quality, multiple variety” red flag competition. From late February to early March, the number of units completing plans ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas is increasing, and the level of steel production is constantly improving. In February, the company's pig iron output increased by 6.3% compared with January; steel output increased by 8.2%. In the first five days of early March, the daily steel output increased by nearly 200 tons compared with the same period in February, and the daily output in the last four days increased by 800 tons compared with the first five days.

    三千万条措施形成强大力量推动竞赛深入发展
    鞍钢职工向高产优质进军
    本报鞍山17日电　鞍钢数十个生产厂矿在总结1958年大跃进经验的基础上，最近普遍组织广大职工认真地讨论了国家分配给鞍钢的生产任务。经过讨论，坚决完成全年钢铁生产计划、大力支援全国的信念，已经在每个职工的思想上落脚生根。职工们在讨论中提出的千万条措施，形成一股强大的动力，推动着业已展开的“高产、优质、多品种”红旗竞赛的深入发展。
    今年，鞍钢担负的钢铁生产任务十分艰巨。几项主要产品——焦炭、生铁、钢、钢材的产量，都比去年高得多。而且，国家要求生产的“铁是好铁，钢是好钢，钢要成材，材要多种”。在开始讨论国家计划以前，各厂矿的干部和职工，都结合总结去年大跃进的经验，认真学习了党的八届六中全会文件，因而思想觉悟大大提高，清楚地认识到鞍钢能不能完成今年的钢铁生产计划，不仅关系到全国一千八百万吨钢产量计划的完成，而且还影响着国家经济建设的速度。因此，当厂矿领导上宣布了今年的计划指标以后，广大职工就表现出极大的热情，表示要鼓足更大的干劲，大力改进操作技术，力争提前完成国家给予的生产任务。第一初轧厂的职工，在讨论计划开始的头两天，就提出了三千六百多件合理化建议，并且很快就实现了一千一百多件，为这个厂4月底以前实现“一厂变两厂”的规划，创造了有利条件。
    在讨论国家计划中，职工们经过找关键，抓措施，算细账，不仅增强了完成跃进计划的信心；而且更多的职工，通过挖潜力，又把国家分配的产品产量指标提高了。第一炼钢厂今年的产钢任务是一百九十万吨，平均每月要完成十六万吨。开始讨论时，有些职工认为月产量这么高，完成有困难。后来经过讨论，找出了去年10月份生产十六万三千吨的事例，加以研究分析，找到实现计划的有利条件；经过进一步算细账、挖潜力，职工们又提出比国家计划高十万吨的跃进计划。中型轧钢厂原来的年产量计划是七十万吨，经过职工讨论，提出今年确保七十五万、力争八十万吨的奋斗目标。担负着鞍钢生产厂矿修配任务的电修厂装配工段，在讨论计划中，职工们找出六十七个浪费劳动力的漏洞，并且提出许多节省劳动力的办法，这样，不仅不要增加人就能完成今年生产任务，还能抽调一部分劳动力支援别的厂矿。
    在讨论计划中，各厂矿都提出
  “边讨论、边试验、边贯彻”的口号，并且积极引导职工群众苦干加巧干，改进操作，加强协作，猛攻生产技术关键，因而有效地推动了当前的生产，使钢铁产品的产量和质量都有了显著提高。第一初轧厂在讨论计划中，及时总结并推广了四号均热炉李长春小组的先进闷炉经验，三天内就有三十八炉烧钢的时间缩短了。第一炼钢厂一号平炉（青年友谊炉），为了解决炉头水套挡火等关键问题，全体职工一面讨论计划，一面献策献计，进行试验，结果很快消灭了水套挡火的现象。这样，全炉职工不仅订出了比国家计划增产一万二千二百吨的跃进计划，而且使2月份的生产日日好转，提前二十四小时完成全月产钢计划。
    现在，各厂矿已经结束了讨论国家计划的工作。鞍钢十多万名职工，正以完成日计划、旬计划、月计划的实际行动，信心百倍地投入到“高产、优质、多品种”的红旗竞赛。从2月下旬到3月上旬以来，提前超额完成计划的单位越来越多，钢铁生产的水平不断提高，2月份，全公司生铁的产量比1月份上升6.3％；钢产量上升8.2％，3月上旬的前五天，钢的日产量比2月同时期增加近二百吨，后四天的日产量又比前五天增加了八百吨。（附图片）
