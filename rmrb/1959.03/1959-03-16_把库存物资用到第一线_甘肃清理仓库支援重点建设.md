	Putting Stock Materials to the Forefront
	Gansu Clears Warehouses to Support Key Construction

	(Our dispatch) Gansu Province's industrial and communications, financial and trade, and cultural and educational system employees are vigorously engaging in a warehouse clearing campaign to support units in urgent need and ensure the smooth progress of key construction projects.

	Since January, according to the spirit of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee's instructions, the industrial and communications, financial and trade, and cultural and educational departments of Gansu Province have carried out ideological education campaigns on "the whole country as one chess game" among employees. They have conducted inspections in all aspects, one of the most important contents of which is to proceed from the overall situation, strengthen collaboration, ensure priorities, and use manpower, materials, and financial resources in the most urgent, effective, and impactful areas. Under the guidance of this idea, all units immediately started clearing their warehouses. Up to now, according to preliminary statistics from provincial-level units alone, the various types of steel materials cleared out, such as steel plates, high-quality steel, section steel, and steel wire ropes, are equivalent to more than half of the steel materials allocated to Gansu by the state in 1958. More than twenty types of major machinery, such as blowers and generators, are almost equal to twice the amount of imports from other regions by local enterprises in Gansu in 1958. Car accessories, which are relatively scarce in the market, worth more than 1.6 million yuan, have been cleared out.

	The employees of all units demonstrated a high degree of communist spirit in this warehouse clearing. In order to support key construction, they carefully checked and rechecked, thoroughly clearing. The Geological Survey Team of the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau had already cleared once, but fearing that important items would be missed, the entire team thoroughly cleared again. Employees used the methods of airing views freely, writing big-character posters, offering suggestions, and devising methods during the warehouse clearing. The second time they cleared out many more materials, including leveling rulers worth more than 1,000 yuan that had been purchased in 1956 and had never been used.

	In this warehouse clearing campaign, all units cleared and processed at the same time, transferring surplus materials and non-urgent materials to key construction departments. The specific method is: some materials are submitted to provincial-level organs for unified allocation, and some materials are directly supported or lent to units in urgent need through mutual consultation. This year, the construction of small blast furnaces throughout the province is a key construction project, but because of the lack of equipment and materials, some small blast furnace equipment could not be rushed out. Now, after the vigorous support of various units, it is estimated that the materials needed to manufacture small blast furnaces can be completely resolved. The second-phase expansion project of the Lanzhou Refinery urgently needed steel plates. After this warehouse clearing campaign, units with steel plates transferred 70 tons from their inventory, meeting the needs of the factory's expansion project. The Northwest Normal University also took the initiative to lend some of the steel materials that were going to be used in the second quarter to the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Plant, helping to solve the plant's current need for steel materials.

### 把库存物资用到第一线  甘肃清理仓库支援重点建设

    把库存物资用到第一线
    甘肃清理仓库支援重点建设
    本报讯　甘肃省工交、财贸和文教系统职工大搞清理仓库运动，把库存物资支援急需单位，保证重点建设的顺利进行。
    1月份以来，甘肃省工交、财贸和文教部门根据省委指示的精神，在职工中开展“全国一盘棋”的思想教育运动，从各方面进行了检查，其中最重要的内容之一，就是要从全局出发，加强协作，保证重点，把人力、物力和财力使用在最迫切需要、收效最快、作用最大的方面。在这个思想指导下，各单位立即动手清理仓库。到目前为止，据省级各单位的初步统计，仅清理出来的钢板、优质钢、型钢、钢丝绳等各种钢材，即等于1958年国家拨给甘肃地方的钢材一半还多，鼓风机、发电机等二十多种主要机械几乎等于1958年甘肃地方企业从外地进口的一倍；市场上比较缺乏的汽车配件，清理出来的值一百六十多万元。
    各单位职工在这次清仓中表现了高度的共产主义精神。为了支援重点建设，他们认真地一查再查，一翻再翻，清理得很彻底。省建筑工程局地质勘测队已经清查了一次，但怕漏掉重要的东西，全队职工又彻底进行了一次清查。职工们在清仓中大鸣大放，写大字报，出主意，想办法，第二次又查出很多物资，其中有1956年采购来一直不用的价值一千多元的水准尺。
    在这次清仓运动中，各单位都是一边清查，一边处理，把多余物资和不急需的物资，调拨给重点建设部门。具体作法是：有些物资上交省级机关进行统一调拨，有些物资相互协商直接支援或借给急需部门。全省今年小高炉建设是建设重点，但因器材缺少，有些小高炉设备就不能赶出来，现在经过各单位的大力支援，据估计，制造小高炉所需材料可以全部解决。兰州炼油厂第二期扩建工程急需钢板，经过这次清仓运动，有钢板的单位从库存中调出了七十吨后，满足了这个厂扩建工程的需要。西北师范大学把第二季度就要使用的钢材，还主动借给了兰州石油化工机械厂一部分，帮助解决了这个厂目前对钢材的需要。
