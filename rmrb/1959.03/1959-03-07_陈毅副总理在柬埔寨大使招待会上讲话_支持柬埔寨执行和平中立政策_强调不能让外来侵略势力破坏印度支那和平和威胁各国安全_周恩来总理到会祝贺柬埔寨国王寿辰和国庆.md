Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Cambodian Ambassador to China, Leng Ngeth, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate the birthday of Cambodian King Norodom Suramarit and the National Day of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Shen Junru, and others attended the reception. Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass at the reception to congratulate His Majesty King Suramarit on his birthday, wishing the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people to continue to develop, and wishing good health to Premier Sihanouk, a friend of the Chinese people. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we fully support the Kingdom of Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, support the Cambodian people's desire to develop their national economy, and support the struggle of the people of Indochina to safeguard independence and defend peace.

Ambassador Leng Ngeth spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said: "Tonight, we are filled with an atmosphere of friendship, which once again demonstrates that each of us has such a strong desire and firm will to further strengthen our friendly ties with the great People's Republic of China and with the embassies of various countries in Beijing."

Ambassador Leng Ngeth said: "Regarding the relationship between China and Cambodia, I am pleased to announce publicly tonight that this relationship is very sincere and fraternal, and that this relationship has yielded very fruitful results in all aspects."

The Ambassador said: "Tonight, I don't need to repeat the memories of the sincere and friendly exchanges between our two countries, such as the mutual visits of our two countries' cultural and artistic delegations, the visit of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to China, and your visit to Cambodia, which are still fresh in our minds; the recent visit of the Chinese women's delegation to Cambodia and the successful exhibition of the achievements of New China's industry and agriculture in Phnom Penh and many provinces of Cambodia."

The Ambassador said: "Our government and all the Khmer people are greatly impressed by the labor organization of your government and the Chinese people, and the outstanding achievements you have made through your efforts."

The Ambassador said: "All Khmer people highly appreciate the generous assistance that China has given us in technology and economy in recent years. These aids have engraved in our hearts the deepest gratitude to your government and people."

Ambassador Leng Ngeth finally raised his glass to wish Chairman Mao Zedong good health and the Chinese people happiness.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, he congratulated the host of today's banquet, Ambassador Leng Ngeth and his wife, and through the Ambassador congratulated His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit on his birthday, and His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people on their National Day.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in his speech just now, His Excellency the Ambassador gave enthusiastic praise to the achievements of our people in construction, for which we are very grateful. The Chinese people have indeed made great achievements in socialist construction. Our people are engaged in peaceful labor, striving to lift their country out of its backward state. However, this is only a beginning. Our current level of industrial and agricultural production is still very low compared to the living needs of our more than 600 million people. Therefore, we regard the praise of friends as an encouragement and spur to ourselves.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people have always cherished the friendly relations between China and Cambodia, because this relationship is in the interests of our two peoples and in the interests of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. His Excellency the Ambassador also mentioned China's economic and technical assistance to Cambodia just now. In fact, this assistance is very small. Because we sympathize with the Cambodian people's desire to build their own country, although our strength is limited, we have still tried our best to provide some assistance. On the other hand, we will not forget the support that the Kingdom of Cambodia has given our country in international affairs. Therefore, this sincere relationship of mutual assistance between our two countries has become an example of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we are very pleased to see that since the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have greatly developed. We believe that due to the joint efforts of the leaders and people of China and Cambodia, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries will continue to develop.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia has been successfully implementing its foreign policy of peace and neutrality, and defending the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian people are also united and working hard to build their own country. We fully support the Kingdom of Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, and support the Cambodian people's desire to develop their national economy. We believe that the Cambodian people will surely achieve new and greater achievements in maintaining independence and national construction in all aspects."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Now, some external forces are stepping up their activities of aggression and interference in Indochina, instigating the countries under their control to carry out subversive activities and military provocations against neighboring countries, and undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, creating tension in Southeast Asia. This has aroused the serious attention of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

The Chinese people fully support the struggle of the people of Indochina to safeguard independence and defend peace. We believe that the Geneva Accords must be observed, and those external aggressive forces must not be allowed to undermine the peace of Indochina and threaten the security of the countries of Indochina."

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally said: "The Chinese and Cambodian people are both peace-loving. Let us join hands to work together to maintain peace in Indochina and to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples!"

Also present at the reception tonight were the heads of various departments of state organs and people from all walks of life in the capital, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China.

    陈毅副总理在柬埔寨大使招待会上讲话
    支持柬埔寨执行和平中立政策
    强调不能让外来侵略势力破坏印度支那和平和威胁各国安全
    周恩来总理到会祝贺柬埔寨国王寿辰和国庆
    新华社6日讯　柬埔寨驻中国大使兰·涅特今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，庆祝柬埔寨国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特寿辰和柬埔寨王国国庆。
    周恩来总理、陈毅、李先念副总理、沈钧儒副委员长等都出席了招待会。周恩来总理在招待会上举杯祝贺苏拉玛里特国王陛下寿辰，祝中柬两国人民的友谊不断发展，祝中国人民的朋友、尊敬的西哈努克首相身体健康。陈毅副总理在讲话中说，我们完全支持柬埔寨王国所执行的和平中立政策，支持柬埔寨人民发展民族经济的愿望，支持印度支那各国人民维护独立和保卫和平的斗争。
    兰·涅特大使在宴会开始时讲话。他说：“今晚在我们之间充满着友好的气氛，这再一次表明了我们每个人具有这样一种热烈的愿望和坚定意志：要更加进一步加强我们同伟大的中华人民共和国，以及同驻北京的各国使馆之间的友好联系。”
    兰·涅特大使说：“关于中国和柬埔寨之间的关系，我能够高兴地在今天晚上当众宣布：这种关系是非常诚挚和亲如兄弟的，这种关系已经在各个方面都结出了非常丰硕的果实。”
    大使说：“今晚，我不需要再来赘述我们两国之间真诚和友好的交往的回忆，譬如，我们两国文化和艺术代表团的相互访问，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下访问中国以及阁下访问柬埔寨，这些交往对我们都还记忆犹新；最近中国妇女代表团的访问柬埔寨以及新中国工农业成就展览会在金边及柬埔寨许多省份的成功展出。”
    大使说：“我国政府和全体高棉人民，对于贵国政府和中国人民的劳动组织，以及你们经过努力所获得的卓越成就，感到极大的钦佩。”
    大使说：“全体高棉人民对于中国近几年来在技术上和经济上不断给予我们慷慨的援助，给以很高的评价。这些援助在我们内心中铭刻下对贵国政府和人民最深切的谢意。”
    兰·涅特大使最后举杯祝毛泽东主席身体健康，祝中国人民幸福。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话。他代表中国政府和中国人民，向今天宴会的主人兰·涅特大使和大使夫人祝贺，并且通过大使向诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特国王陛下祝贺他的寿辰，向诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下，柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民祝贺国庆。
    陈毅副总理说，大使阁下在刚才的讲话中，对我国人民建设中的成就作了热情的赞扬，这是我们非常感谢的。中国人民在社会主义建设中确实取得了伟大的成就。我国人民正在进行着和平的劳动，努力使自己的国家摆脱落后的状态。但是，这还只是一个开始。我们现在的工农业生产水平同我们的六亿多人口的生活需要比较起来，还是很低的。因此，我们把朋友的赞扬看作是对自己的鼓励和鞭策。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民一向十分珍视中柬两国的友好关系，因为这种关系符合我们两国人民的利益，也符合维护亚洲和世界和平的利益。大使阁下刚才还提到了我国对柬埔寨的经济和技术援助。其实这些援助是很小的。由于我们同情柬埔寨人民建设自己祖国的愿望，虽然我国的力量有限，但也还是尽量提供了一些援助。另一方面，我们也不会忘记柬埔寨王国在国际事务中给我国的支持，因此，我们两国相互援助的这种真诚关系，成了不同社会制度国家间友好合作的一个榜样。
    陈毅副总理说，我们十分满意地看到，自从我们两国建立正常的外交关系以来，我们两国人民之间以和平共处五项原则为基础的友好合作关系有了很大的发展。我们相信，由于中柬两国领导人和两国人民的共同努力，两国间的友好合作关系还会得到不断的发展。
    陈毅副总理说：“柬埔寨王国政府在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的领导下，一直在成功地执行着它的和平中立的外交政策，捍卫着柬埔寨王国的独立。柬埔寨人民也正在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王领导下，团结一致地为建设自己的祖国而努力。我们完全支持柬埔寨王国所执行的和平中立政策，支持柬埔寨人民发展民族经济的愿望。我们相信，柬埔寨人民一定会在维护独立和国家建设的各个方面取得新的更大的成就。”
    陈毅副总理说：“现在，有些外来的势力正在印度支那加紧进行侵略和干涉的活动，唆使在它控制下的国家对邻国进行颠复活动和军事挑衅，并且破坏日内瓦协议的实施，在东南亚制造紧张局势。这引起了一切爱好和平的国家和人民的严重注意。
    中国人民完全支持印度支那各国人民维护独立和保卫和平的斗争。我们认为，日内瓦协议必须得到遵守，不能让那些外来的侵略势力破坏印度支那的和平和威胁印度支那各国的安全。”
    陈毅副总理最后说：“中柬两国人民都是爱好和平的，让我们携起手来，为维护印度支那的和平，为加强我们两国人民的友谊，而共同努力！”
    今晚，出席招待会的，还有国家机关各部门的负责人和首都社会各界人士，以及各国驻中国的使节和外交官员。
