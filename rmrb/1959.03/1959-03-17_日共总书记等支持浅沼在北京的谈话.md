Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto and leaders of various organizations today published statements in the "Akahata" newspaper, unanimously expressing their support for the remarks made by Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation to China, in Beijing, regarding "American imperialism as the common enemy of the people of China and Japan."

    Kenji Miyamoto pointed out that American imperialism is indeed the common enemy of the people of Japan and China. Therefore, the people of Japan and China naturally have the basis and right to wage a struggle against American imperialism. The joint statement of the Communist Parties of Japan and China has already expressed a clear attitude on this point.

    Miyamoto pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party's rude "protest" against Asanuma's remarks shows that their mental state has become abnormal in order to show loyalty to its master, American imperialism.

    Miyamoto said that the Liberal Democratic Party and the reactionaries have consistently used the name of "supra-partisan diplomacy" to demand that the Socialist Party take consistent steps with them in foreign policy, and have placed expectations on the Socialist Party. This "protest" shows that their expectations have been frustrated.

    In his speech, Miyamoto demanded that the Socialist Party maintain a resolute attitude.

    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, also expressed support for Asanuma's remarks, saying that it was a statement from the standpoint of the majority of the Japanese people. Iwai pointed out that the attitude of the Liberal Democratic Party towards Asanuma's remarks shows that the roots of their policy of hostility towards China are very deep. However, precisely because they have adopted this attitude, they will be increasingly spurned by the Japanese people and become more isolated internationally.

    Akira Kazami, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, expressed his heartfelt support for Asanuma's remarks. He said that under the current circumstances, the Japanese people must clearly identify friends and enemies. He also strongly condemned the Liberal Democratic Party.

    日共总书记等支持浅沼在北京的谈话
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治和各界团体领袖今天在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，一致表示支持日本社会党访华代表团团长浅沼稻次郎在北京发表的关于“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人”的谈话。
    宫本显治指出，美帝国主义是日中两国人民共同的敌人，这完全是真实的。因此，日中两国人民当然有对美帝国主义展开斗争的根据和权利。日中两国共产党的联合声明已经对于这一点表示了明确的态度。
    宫本指出，自由民主党对浅沼的这番谈话提出无礼的“抗议”表明，它们为了表示对它的主子——美帝国主义的忠诚，精神状态已经失常。
    宫本说，自由民主党和反动派一贯假借“超党派外交”名义要求社会党在外交政策上同它们采取一致步骤，并且对社会党寄于期望。这次“抗议”表明了它们这种期望已经遭到了挫折。
    宫本在谈话中要求社会党坚持断然的态度。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章也表示支持浅沼的谈话，他说，这是站在大多数日本人民的立场的发言。岩井指出，自由民主党对于浅沼的谈话所表现的态度表明了它们敌视中国的政策的根源是很深的。但是，正是因为采取了这种态度，它们将越来越被日本人民所唾弃，并且在国际上更加孤立。
    恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章表示衷心支持浅沼的谈话。他说，日本人民在目前的情况下，必须明确地识别朋友和敌人。他并且强烈谴责了自由民主党。
