Beijing's Morning
　　In the morning, I walked out of the gate, the air was so sweet and fragrant; the sun hadn't shown its face yet, but first hung the colorful clouds in the east. Red light shone everywhere, and red flags fluttered. Everyone is busy starting a new day. Every time a new day comes, how many new miracles will be created! The newly published People's Daily will tell you how much Beijing has leaped forward! How much has the motherland leaped forward!
　　I walked out of the alley and onto the wide street. This is East Chang'an Street, which extends to Jianguomen. Looking west – it's so wide, so bright, so straight, and so long. The buses coming and going are like shuttles. As soon as each bus stops, the conductor will warmly shout:
　　"Good morning! Good morning! We've come to pick you up!"
　　I jumped on the bus to do voluntary labor in front of Tiananmen Square. Passing through Dongdan, the road is being renovated here, and road rollers and loaders are rumbling loudly! It seems to be saying: Quickly repair this best road so that the parade for the tenth anniversary of the National Day can pass smoothly!
　　I arrived in front of Tiananmen Square, the capital is so glorious and splendid! I put on my willow hat and rushed to the construction site, where the workers are skillfully decorating the square, so that people can revel here to their heart's content. Layers of scaffolding stretched into the sky, and the magnificent buildings showed their smiles. This is such a sacred place, where we labor happily!

    北京的早晨
    丁力早晨，我走出大门，空气是那么甜，那么香；太阳还没有露面，先把彩霞挂在东方红光普照，红旗飘扬。每个人，都在为新的一天开始忙。每当新的一天来到，该有多少新的奇迹在创造！新出版的人民日报，会告诉你北京又跃进了多少！祖国又跃进了多少！我走出胡同，走在宽阔的大街上，这是东长安街，它伸延到建国门了，向西一望——又宽，又光，又直，又长。来往的公共汽车，好像穿梭一样。每部车子刚一停站，售票员就会热情的喊叫：
  “您早！您早！我们接您来了！我跳上公共汽车，到天安门前去义务劳动。驰过东单，这里正在翻修马路，碾路机，铲运机大声哄哄！好像在说：快把这条最好的马路修好，让国庆十周年游行的队伍畅通！我到了天安门前，首都多么光辉灿烂！我戴上柳条帽奔向工地，工人们正在为广场巧加打扮，好让人们在这里尽情狂欢。层层脚手架伸到了半空，宏伟的大厦露出了笑容，这是多么神圣的地方，我们在这里愉快地劳动！
