Shandong's Four Thousand Fishing Boats Set Sail Early
Yellow Sea Surface Begins to Discover "Penaeus chinensis" Shoals

(Our newspaper Jinan, March 13th) This year's spring fishing season has arrived early, and a vigorous high tide of marine fishery production is taking shape in coastal areas of Shandong Province. Along the long coastline of Jiaodong, four thousand fishing boats have set sail to fish, and more than forty thousand fishermen are putting their soaring energy into spring fishing production activities. In the fishery teams of the people's communes in the Bohai Bay area, this year they also went to sea half a month earlier than in previous years, breaking the old habit of not going to sea until after March. The province had hauled in more than 14,000 tons of various seafoods by March 5th, and production in January and February increased by 62% compared with the same period last year.

This year, Shandong Province has good weather, warm spring water, and an early fishing season. Penaeus chinensis have begun to appear on the Yellow Sea. In the past five days, state-owned aquatic product companies in Yantai and Qingdao have caught more than 8,000 catties of fresh Penaeus chinensis. This year, fish and shrimp appeared early in counties such as Penglai and Rongcheng, and the fish shoals are concentrated and grow plump. One tide can reach 7,000 catties. In order not to miss this great opportunity, fishermen in many areas have launched a red flag competition movement. The fishermen in the Yinghai Commune Fishery Production Management Area of Jiaoxian County set sail fifteen days earlier this year and proposed to return fifteen days later. They will set up camps in the fishing area, increase operation time, find fish shoals, welcome the head of the fish, chase the tail of the fish, continuously operate, and transport in batches to ensure that they over fulfill the production plan of one million catties.

This year, fishing workers and fishermen in various places are making great efforts in technical revolution. In order to increase the catch, the workers of the aquatic products company have adopted the advanced experience of light nets and quick lifting. Large surrounding nets, mid-layer nets, and three-layer nets have also been added to capture large quantities of chub mackerel and various fish shoals when the fishing season arrives. Fishing teams in coastal people's communes have also changed small nets to large nets, increased the height and length of the original nets, added bottom rings, and converted them into loose-legged drift nets and bottomless nets. At the same time, foot-operated propellers and net lifting machines have also been created to replace manual rowing and manual net lifting. (Ai Yun)

### 山东四千渔船提前出海  黄海海面开始发现“对虾”群

    山东四千渔船提前出海
    黄海海面开始发现“对虾”群
    本报济南13日电　今年春季渔汛提前到来，一个轰轰烈烈的海洋渔业生产高潮正在山东省沿海各地形成。在胶东沿海漫长的海岸线上，有四千艘渔船扬帆出海捕鱼，四万多名渔民正以冲天的干劲投入春汛生产活动。在渤海湾一带的人民公社的渔业队，今年也比往年提前半月出海，打破了过去3月以后才下海的老习惯。全省到3月5日已扑捞各种海鲜一万四千多吨，1至2月份的生产，比去年同期增加62％。
    今年山东省气候好，春水暖，渔汛早，在黄海海面已开始出现对虾。烟台和青岛地区的国营水产公司，在最近五天里已捕到鲜对虾八千多斤。蓬莱、荣成等县今年鱼、虾出现得早，鱼群集中，长得肥美，一潮可达七千斤。许多地区的渔民为了不放过这个大好时机，都展开了红旗竞赛运动。胶县营海公社渔业生产管理区的渔民们，今年提前十五天出海，并提出，要晚回十五天，在渔区安营扎寨，增加作业时间，找鱼群，迎鱼头，追鱼尾，连续作业，分打伙运，保证超额完成一百万斤的生产计划。
    各地捕鱼工人和渔民们今年大闹技术革命。为了增加捕鱼量，水产公司工人们采取了轻网快提的先进经验。并且增添了大围网、中层网、三层网，以备渔汛来时大量捕捉鲐鱼和各种鱼群。沿海各人民公社捕鱼队，也把小网改成大网，将原网加高加长带底环，改成散腿流网、无底网，同时，还创造了脚踏推进器和起网机，用来代替人力摇橹和人力起网。　（艾蕴）
