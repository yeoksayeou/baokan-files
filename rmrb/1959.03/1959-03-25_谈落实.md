Title: On Implementation

To do anything, it must be implemented.

Without implementation, it's like a person suspended in mid-air, feet not on the ground, and things will certainly not be done well.

Sometimes, when a task is assigned, meetings are held, resolutions are made, and tasks are distributed, it seems like everything is fine. But that is not the case. Upon deeper examination, the task is still only at the level of words or on paper, not followed through to the end, not with each nail hammered in tight, and specific problems are not really solved.

This is called lack of implementation. Lack of implementation means that the problem has not been solved. To solve a problem, it must be implemented.

This is a general principle. In economic work, implementation is especially important. Because the economy is a very complex organism, one link connected to the next, and if one link is not implemented, it will often affect a series of links.

In economic work, the first and most important link is that the plan must be implemented. Today's newspaper has a good example.

When discussing the national plan, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory pushed the production tasks all the way down to each worker, and then formulated the leap forward plan and measures level by level from the bottom up, so that everyone had clear goals and reliable measures. This embodies the spirit of plan implementation and the spirit of making economic work more and more detailed.

Plan implementation is a very detailed organizational work that all levels of economic leading institutions must do. Taking enterprises as an example, it is very important to hand over the production tasks to the workers for discussion, and to formulate plans and measures level by level from the bottom up. After such a discussion, the plan can be made more in line with objective reality, which is conducive to giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and solving some problems that the leading organs cannot solve when balancing the plan. But this cannot be called complete implementation, because it cannot guarantee that the entire enterprise will complete the national plan on time, in quantity, and in quality. To achieve this, the leading comrades of the enterprise must, on the basis of organizing workers to discuss the national plan, arrange the production progress of each workshop and each machine by month, by ten-day period, and by day, and also arrange the supply plan of raw materials and tools by month, by ten-day period, and by day, and then designate specific personnel to be responsible for it, and designate specific personnel to check it every day, so as to find problems in time and solve them in time. Taking the leading organs of a region or a department as an example, to implement the plan, it is necessary to distribute the specific product plan to the factory. Who produces the main equipment? Who produces the auxiliary equipment? Who produces the host machine? Who produces the accessories? How is the raw material supplied? What is produced first? What is produced later? etc., must be clearly defined, the production progress of each enterprise and each product must be arranged month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period, and specific personnel must be designated to be responsible for regular inspection and supervision, otherwise, it is dangerous to let the plan fall through if the meeting is held in a general way, and what products are arranged in what place, arranged in which factory to produce, when to complete, what difficulties are encountered in production, etc., are not very clear. This kind of unimplementable arrangement can be said to be equal to no arrangement.

Socialist economy develops in a planned and proportional way. If a department or an enterprise fails to complete the national plan on time, in quantity, in quality, and in complete sets, it will increase difficulties for other departments and other enterprises. Especially important products, such as rolling steel, mining, coal washing and coking, power generation, irrigation and drainage machinery, and locomotives and vehicles, etc., in the current machinery industry, which are directly related to ensuring the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, must be completed according to plan on time, in quantity, in quality, and in complete sets, otherwise it will affect the overall situation. Therefore, the planning and arrangement of the production of important products and key construction projects cannot be sloppy at all and must be implemented.

The communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "Economic work must be more and more meticulous." The more meticulous the work is, from the perspective of the economic work's guidelines, policies, and plans, the more in line with objective reality and the more realistic it is; from the perspective of economic organizational work, the more specific and in-depth the work is, making the plan more implementable. This year's national economic development plan, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, is in line with objective reality. The problem now is that economic departments and enterprises at all levels must make organizational work keep up with the needs of the Great Leap Forward, and make all plans be implemented item by item.

Emphasizing plan implementation is by no means conservative. Conservatism is underestimating favorable conditions and not doing things that can be done through effort. Implementation is a highly responsible spirit for the cause of the people and a down-to-earth and meticulous style. No matter what you do, don't be satisfied with holding meetings to arrange things and issuing instructions, or being satisfied with "roughly about right," but pull the vines and pick the melons, and get to the bottom of things. This style is a guarantee that everything that can be done through effort can be realized perfectly. This style is needed not only in economic work, but also in any revolutionary work; it is needed not only by leading staff, but also by general staff. This style of paying attention to implementation in everything and everyone paying attention to implementation, combined with the vigorous revolutionary vigor and the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, will enable us to overcome any difficulties and move forward by leaps and bounds.

The first quarter is coming to an end. Time waits for no one, opportunity knocks but once. We must seize the time, not let a minute or a second go to waste, we must firmly grasp organizational work, so that every product, especially important products, is implemented, and can complete the plan on a daily, ten-day, monthly, and complete-set basis.

    谈落实
    王朴
    办任何事情，都要落实。
    不落实，就像人悬在半空，脚不踏地，那样事情一定是办不好的。
    有时候，布置一件工作，会也开了，决议也做了，任务也分配了，似乎万事大吉了。其实不然。往深里一追，任务还只是停留在口头上、书面上，并没有一竿子到底，并非钉是钉，铆是铆，具体问题都实实在在解决了。
    这就叫不落实。不落实就是没有解决问题。要想解决问题，就一定要落实。
    这是一般的道理。在经济工作中，落实尤其重要。因为经济是一个十分复杂的有机体，一环扣一环，一环不落实，往往会影响到一连串的环节。
    在经济工作中，首要的一环是计划要落实。今天本报有一个好例子。
    上海机床厂在讨论国家计划的时候，把生产任务一竿子插到底，交到每个工人，再自下而上地逐级制定跃进计划和措施，使人人目标明确，个个措施可靠。这体现了计划落实的精神，也体现了经济工作愈作愈细致的精神。
    计划落实，是个很细致的组织工作，各级经济领导机构都得做。拿企业来说，把生产任务交给工人讨论，自下而上地逐级制定计划和措施，是很重要的。经过这么一次讨论，可以使计划更符合于客观实际，有利于充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，解决了一些领导机关平衡计划时所不能解决的问题。但这还不能叫完全落实，因为这还不能保证整个企业按期、按量、按质地完成国家计划。要做到这一点，企业的领导同志，就得在组织职工讨论国家计划的基础上，把各车间、各台机器所生产的产品进度，按月、按旬、按日排出来，把原材料和工具等的供应计划，也按月、按旬、按日排出来，然后指定专人负责，指定专人逐日检查，以便及时发现问题，及时解决。拿一个地区或一个部门的领导机关来说，要使计划落实，就必须把具体的产品计划分到工厂去。谁生产主要设备？谁生产辅助设备？谁生产主机？谁生产配件？原材料怎样供应？先生产什么？后生产什么？等等，都要定得清清楚楚，把每一个企业、每一种产品的生产进度，逐月逐旬排出来，并且指定专人负责经常检查督促，否则，笼笼统统地开会布置一下，至于什么产品安排在什么地方，安排在哪一个工厂生产，什么时候完成，生产中有什么困难等等，都不甚了了，就有使计划落空的危险。这种不落实的安排，可以说是等于没有安排。
    社会主义经济是有计划按比例发展的。一个部门、一个企业，不能按期、按量、按质、按套地完成国家计划，都会给别的部门、别的企业增加困难。特别是重要产品，如目前机械工业中的轧钢、矿山、洗煤炼焦、发电、排灌机械和机车车辆等对保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标实现有直接关系的设备，一定要按期、按量、按质、按套完成计划，否则就会牵动全局。所以，对于重要产品的生产和重点建设项目的计划安排，更是一点也马虎不得的，非落实不可。
    党的八届六中全会公报指出：“经济工作一定要愈作愈细致。”愈作愈细致，从经济工作的方针、政策、计划方面说，就是愈作愈符合于客观实际，愈实事求是；从经济组织工作方面说，就是愈作愈具体，愈深入，使计划愈落实。今年以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济发展计划，是符合于客观实际的。现在的问题，就是各级经济部门、企业单位要使组织工作赶上大跃进的需要，使各项计划项项落实。
    强调计划落实绝不是保守。保守是对有利的条件估计不足，对于经过努力可以办到的事不去办。落实是对人民的事业具有高度的负责到底的精神，是踏踏实实的一丝不苟的作风。不论做什么事情，都不要满足于开会布置，发指示，满足于“大概差不多”，而要牵藤摘瓜，穷根究底。这种作风，是使凡是经过努力可以办得到的事能完满实现的保证。这种作风，不仅在经济工作中需要，在任何革命工作中都需要；不仅是领导工作人员需要，一般工作人员也需要。这种事事讲究落实、人人讲究落实的作风和蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，和冲天的革命干劲结合起来，我们就可以战胜任何困难，大踏步地前进。
    第一季度快过去了。机不可失，时不再来。必须争取时间，一分一秒也不让空过去，必须紧紧抓组织工作，使每一种产品特别是重要产品都落实，都能按日、按旬、按月和按套完成计划。
