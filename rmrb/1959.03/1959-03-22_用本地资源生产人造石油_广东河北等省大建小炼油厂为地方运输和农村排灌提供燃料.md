Xinhua News Agency, March 21st – Guangdong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia are actively utilizing local resources to produce synthetic petroleum, to meet the growing need for gasoline, diesel, and other fuels following the increase in local transportation and rural irrigation machinery this year.

The more than 250 small-scale, piled dry distillation oil furnaces built in Guangdong Province have mostly been put into production, and can produce more than 25,000 tons of petroleum annually. In Shanxi Province, which is rich in coal deposits, more than 200 small-scale coal refineries have been built and are currently producing crude oil in large quantities. After a batch of coal refineries in Datong City, Shanxi, went into production, they use 40 tons of coal daily to produce more than 1,600 kilograms of gasoline and light and heavy diesel, and also produce large amounts of sulfur ammonia and semi-coke. In areas with oil shale, Hebei and Jilin provinces have built a number of small-scale shale oil refineries, which are currently stepping up crude oil production. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which previously did not produce any oil, has now built 46 small oil plants with an annual output of less than 1,000 tons. Luan Chuan County in the Funiu Mountain area, Henan Province, is actively developing synthetic petroleum industry by utilizing the abundant oil shale deposits. Currently, it has produced more than 8,000 jin of crude oil using indigenous methods, and has extracted high-quality gasoline, diesel, and kerosene from it. The Sanshengyu People's Commune Oil Plant in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, has now built ten shale dry distillation piles with an annual output of 300 tons and five with an annual output of 100 tons. To date, they have produced 240,000 jin of crude oil.

Many small oil plants are adopting comprehensive utilization methods to fully utilize raw materials. The workers of the Shijiazhuang Synthetic Petroleum Plant have made two distillation kettles themselves to process crude oil, and have now produced 16 products including kerosene, gasoline, light and heavy diesel, crude phenol, transformer oil, and lubricating oil, greatly reducing costs compared to when they only produced crude oil. Some small synthetic petroleum plants in the Jinbei area of Shanxi Province also promote the "coal, coke, oil, and chemical industry" four-in-one production method, simultaneously carrying out coal mining, coking, oil extraction, and production of chemical raw materials, making one coal serve multiple purposes. In areas where coal supply is insufficient, many small oil plants actively link up and sign contracts with coal plants, coking plants, thermal power plants, railway bureaus, and coal sales stores and other units with large coal reserves, solving the difficulty of insufficient raw material sources for oil plants. Some local oil plants also use pine roots and peat to extract oil to expand oil sources.

    用本地资源生产人造石油
    广东河北等省大建小炼油厂为地方运输和农村排灌提供燃料
    新华社21日讯　广东、河北、山西、河南、陕西、吉林和内蒙古等地积极利用本地资源生产人造石油，以适应今年地方运输和农村排灌机械增加之后，对于汽油、柴油等燃料的更大需要。
    广东省兴建的二百五十多座小型成堆干馏油炉，大部投入了生产，每年可产石油二万五千多吨。在煤藏丰富的山西省，已建成小型煤炼油厂二百多个，目前正在大量生产原油。山西大同市的一批煤炼油厂投入生产后，每天用煤四十吨，生产汽油和轻重柴油一千六百多公斤，并且还生产了大量的硫氨和半焦。河北、吉林两省在有油母页岩的地区，已经兴建起一批小型页岩炼油厂，目前正在加紧生产原油。过去根本不产石油的内蒙古自治区，现在也兴建起年产一千吨以下的小型油厂四十六座。地处伏牛山区的河南栾川县，利用本地蕴藏丰富的油页岩积极发展人造石油工业，目前已采用土法生产出八千多斤原油，并且从中提炼出了质量很好的汽油、柴油和煤油。吉林省农安县三盛玉人民公社石油厂，现在已经建成十个年产三百吨和五个年产一百吨的页岩干馏堆，到目前为止，他们已生产原油二十四万斤。
    许多小型油厂采用综合利用的方法，充分使用原材料。石家庄市人造石油厂的职工，自己制成两个蒸馏釜加工原油，现在已生产出煤油、汽油、轻重柴油、粗酚、变压器油和润滑油等十六种产品，成本比原来只生产原油时降低很多。山西晋北地区一些小型人造石油厂，还提倡煤、焦、油、化（工）四位一体的生产方法，同时进行采煤、炼焦、取油和生产化工原料，使一煤百用。在煤炭供应不足的地方，许多小油厂主动地和煤厂、炼焦厂、火电厂、铁路局，以及煤炭销售商店等用煤存煤较多的单位挂钩订合同，解决了油厂原料来源不足的困难。有些地方油厂，还利用松根和泥炭提炼油，以扩大油源。
