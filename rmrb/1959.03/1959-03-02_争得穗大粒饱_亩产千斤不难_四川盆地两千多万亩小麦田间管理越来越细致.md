(Reported by our newspaper from Chengdu on March 1) The vast number of peasants in Sichuan Province are exerting great efforts to strive to become a high-yield wheat province this year, and are strengthening wheat field management with increasing meticulousness.

At present, the 23 million mu of wheat in the basin are growing particularly lush and strong. After three or four irrigations and top dressings, most wheat seedlings are one or two chi high and are already jointing and heading. Generally, there are 500,000 plants per mu. Observations show that each wheat ear generally forms 17 to 21 florets, approximately 30 to 40 grains. As a result of deep plowing and heavy application of base fertilizer, the root systems penetrate the soil to a depth of about one chi. Recently, there has been widespread welcome rain in various places, and the vast number of peasants are seizing this favorable opportunity to advance victoriously, and are universally launching the wheat thousand-jin high-yield competition throughout the province.

This year, Sichuan Province began to focus on wheat yield increase from the outset, laying the foundation for large-scale high yields. Through ideological education, various localities have corrected the thinking of some farmers who valued rice over wheat, making full use of all land suitable for planting to expand the wheat area by 1.3 million mu. The situation of meticulous farming and careful cultivation is also better than in any previous year. More than 70% of the wheat fields have been deeply plowed to a depth of one to one and a half chi, and fertilizer has been applied in layers at a rate of 30,000 to 50,000 jin or more per mu. The seeding rate is 30 to 50 jin per mu, and strip planting with close spacing is generally practiced. There are 5 million mu of high-yielding demonstration fields, where deep plowing, fertilization, and technical specifications have been implemented particularly well, and are regarded as production banners for cadres and the masses.

"Pass the five hurdles and carry out the five preventions" is the fighting slogan of the province's peasants in doing a good job in wheat field management and striving for a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Currently, most areas have begun to apply heading fertilizer. Each time, 30 to 80 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu. Many areas are adopting the method of "eating small meals frequently" to allow the wheat seedlings to fully absorb nutrients and improve fertilizer efficiency. Nanchong, Neijiang, Leshan and other special districts, at the beginning of wheat heading, mobilized more than 2 million people to apply "ear-boosting fertilizer" and "grain-boosting fertilizer," applying 3,000 to 5,000 jin of refined fertilizer per mu to promote the growth of wheat ears with many full grains. Weiyuan, Jianyang, Zizhong and other counties have consolidated more than 3,000 Zha River dams to block water and irrigate wheat. Renshou County mobilized more than 6,500 waterwheels to irrigate more than 200,000 mu of wheat within a few days, accounting for more than half of all wheat fields. Most of the wheat in Wenjiang, Leshan, and Mianyang special districts has been irrigated once, ensuring the water needed for heading. Applying such a large amount of fertilizer and irrigating with water is something that has never happened before. As the weather warms up, pests are prone to occur, and local indigenous pesticide factories are stepping up the production of pesticides to support the elimination of pests. In Santai County, more than 300 indigenous pesticide factories were established in various communes, manufacturing more than 20 million jin of powder and emulsion pesticides, and timely eliminating aphids and wheat stem flies on a total of more than 62,000 mu of wheat. In the context of the particularly lush growth of wheat throughout the province, people's communes in various places are actively finding ways to prevent lodging as early as possible. Many indigenous chemical fertilizer plants are also studying and manufacturing drugs to prevent lodging. Huayang County uses various fertilizers mixed to make anti-lodging elements, which are applied to wheat fields that are about to lodge, making the wheat seedlings grow strong and no longer lodge. Now, the county has produced more than 30 million jin of anti-lodging elements. Many places also adopt measures such as setting up racks with sticks, cultivating soil to build up mounds, increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, and driving away dew to prevent lodging. Many places have also strengthened reconnaissance work, setting up observation sheds on hilltops and field edges, setting up reconnaissance posts and climate and pest forecasting stations, and preventing unexpected events that affect wheat seedling growth at any time.

Recently, the provincial agricultural bureau and department heads meeting held in Chengdu, based on the fact that wheat seedling growth in various places is better than in any previous year, believed that the province has a great hope of advancing towards 1,000 jin, and the current focus is on how to make the third-class seedlings, which account for about 10% of the total, achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The meeting proposed to further combine production with large-scale appraisal competitions, boost efforts, add measures, further criticize the ideas of "wheat is a foregone conclusion" and "focusing on major spring and neglecting minor spring," and deeply develop the wheat thousand-jin movement.

    争得穗大粒饱　亩产千斤不难
    四川盆地两千多万亩小麦田间管理越来越细致
    本报成都1日电　四川省广大农民为力争今年跃为小麦高产省，正鼓足干劲，越来越细致地加强小麦田间管理。
    目前，盆地里的两千三百万亩小麦，生长得格外青葱茁壮。经过三、四次浇灌追肥之后，大多数麦苗高一两尺，已在拔节孕穗；一般每亩有五十万株，据观察，孕成麦穗一般有小花十七至二十一个，约三、四十粒；由于深耕和重施底肥的结果，根系入土深达一尺左右。最近各地又普降喜雨，广大农民正抓紧这一有利时机，乘胜前进。把小麦千斤高产竞赛普遍在全省开展起来。
    今年四川省一开始就抓紧了小麦丰产，为大面积高产奠定基础。各地通过思想教育纠正了部分农民重水稻轻小麦的思想，充分利用一切适于播种的土地，扩大小麦面积一百三十万亩；精耕细作的情况也比任何一年都好。占70％以上的麦地都深耕一尺到一尺五，并分层施肥三万到五万斤以上；用种量每亩在三十斤到五十斤，普遍实行条播密植。有五百万亩高额丰产田，深耕施肥和技术规格贯彻得格外好，被当作干部和群众的生产旗帜。
    “过五关、搞五防”，是全省农民作好小麦田间管理工作，力争小麦亩产千斤的战斗口号。现在大部地区已开始追施孕穗肥。每亩每次追肥三十挑至八十挑。不少地区采用“少吃多餐”的施肥方法，使麦苗充分吸收养料，提高肥效。南充、内江、乐山等专区，在小麦孕穗开始时，出动两百多万人追施
  “攻穗肥”和“攻粒肥”，每亩施精肥三千到五千斤，促进麦穗长得粒多实满。威远、简阳、资中等县扎河堰三千多道，堵水浇灌小麦。仁寿县动员了六千五百多部水车，数日之内浇灌小麦二十多万亩，占全部麦田的一半以上。温江、乐山、绵阳专区大部小麦都已浇灌一次，保证了孕穗需水。追施这样多的肥料和用水浇灌在以往是不曾有过的事，随着天气转暖，害虫容易发生，各地土农药厂加紧生产农药，支援扑灭虫害。三台县各公社开办了土农药厂三百多个，制造了粉剂和乳剂农药两千多万斤，及时除治小麦的蚜虫、麦潜蝇共六万二千多亩。在全省小麦普遍生长特别茂盛的情况下，各地人民公社积极设法及早防止倒伏。许多土化肥厂还研究制造出防止倒伏的药物。华阳县用各种肥料混合制成的防伏素，施在将要倒伏的麦田里，使麦苗生长健壮，不再倒伏，现在全县已制出三千多万斤防伏素。许多地方还采用上夹搭架、培土壅兜、增施磷钾肥、赶露水等措施，防止倒伏。许多地方还加强了侦察工作，在山头、地边搭观察棚，设侦察哨和气候、虫害预报站，随时预防影响麦苗生长的意外事件发生。
    最近在成都举行的全省各专区农业局、处长会议根据各地麦苗生长比以往任何一年都好的情况，认为全省向千斤跃进希望很大，当前中心是如何使约占10％的三类苗亩产达千斤。会议提出要进一步结合生产大搞评比竞赛，鼓干劲，添措施，进一步批判“小麦定局论”和“重大春轻小春”的思想，深入开展小麦千斤运动。（附图片）
