Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" today published an editorial entitled "A Program for the Common Struggle Uniting the People of Japan and China," commenting on the important significance of the joint statement issued by the delegation of the Japanese Communist Party and the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party. The editorial stated that this joint statement further consolidated the solidarity of the Communist Parties of Japan and China. It is a historically significant document pointing out the path for the two peoples to strengthen friendship and cooperation, and it is also a program for the nearly 800 million people of the two countries to wage a common struggle against the American imperialists. This statement has been wholeheartedly welcomed by Japanese communists and the Japanese people.

"Akahata" said that the joint statement clarifies the common goals of the two communist parties and the two peoples: to further unite the people around the party, to oppose the American imperialist policy of aggression in the Far East, to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

"Akahata" emphasized that as long as the unity between the Japanese people and the people of socialist countries is strengthened, the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism and for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality will inevitably be victorious.

The editorial said that the great Chinese people, who have achieved victory in the struggle against imperialism and liberated themselves, are true friends of all oppressed nations in the world, and have always sincerely sympathized with the plight of the Japanese people after the war and supported the just struggle of the Japanese people. The editorial pointed out that this joint statement once again firmly demonstrates the Chinese people's active support and cooperation with the Japanese people. The editorial emphasized that maintaining peace in the Far East and Asia is the common cause of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries. Therefore, the Japanese people must launch a struggle against American imperialism, strive to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and make Japan a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral country. This is the responsibility that the Japanese people must shoulder.

"Akahata" called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to deeply understand the important significance of the joint statement, while also going deep among the broad masses of the people to correctly publicize the significance of the joint statement, to arm the people with internationalist thought, to strengthen the unity of the Japanese people with the people of China and Korea and other Asian countries, and to strive to achieve the goals specified in the two joint statements issued separately by the Japanese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party, and the Japanese Communist Party and the Korean Workers' Party.
