Wheat Lodging Can Be Prevented
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

High-yielding wheat fields have high density and heavy ears. If the wheat stems are not strengthened accordingly, lodging will occur. If management measures are followed, lodging can be prevented.

        Causes of Lodging
Lodging can occur at different stages of wheat growth. Some lodging starts in the seedling stage, mostly due to shallow plowing depth, poor root development, excessive plant density on the ground, insufficient light penetration, high temperature, high humidity, and excessive nitrogen fertilizer application, resulting in excessive vegetative growth, elongated leaf sheaths becoming soft "supports," and soft stem tissue unable to bear the weight of the leaves, causing lodging. Such wheat is difficult to grow normally without remedial measures. Some wheat lodges after heading, due to poor internode growth at the base of the stem, sparse mechanical tissue between cells, thin hypodermis, thin cell elongation walls, and small stem support. Therefore, after the ear is formed, it cannot bear the weight and lodges. Once lodged, nutrients cannot be transported normally, and it is easily mildewed and rotten when compressed on the damp ground.

Some wheat lodges after grain filling, also due to insufficient stem support, but the loss from lodging at this time is small. In addition to poor grain filling, it may also cause the grains to become damp and germinate. Lodging of wheat after heading is mostly caused by external forces such as storms. Plants that grow stronger can still rise upwards from the nodes after lodging, but those that do not grow well or encounter continuous rainy days will not easily rise.

        Cultivate Plants with Strong Roots
To prevent lodging, it is first necessary to create good development conditions for wheat roots. Therefore, deep plowing and careful cultivation, and applying organic fertilizer as base fertilizer (applying more and evenly) are prerequisites for ensuring that wheat in high-yielding fields does not lodge. At the same time, the seeding rate should be reasonable, and the sowing time should be appropriate, so that the seedlings can tiller healthily before winter, and the secondary roots can grow fully, laying the foundation for strong plants.

In addition, pay attention to selecting excellent varieties with strong stems. For example, in northern regions, Zaoyangmai can be selected, and in southern regions, Nandai 2419 and Zhongnong No. 28 can be selected.

        Several Methods to Prevent Lodging Currently
At present, the earth is rejuvenating, and wheat is recovering its vitality after a winter dormancy. Improper management measures can easily cause lodging. The following are several methods to prevent wheat lodging currently:

First, Fertilization and Irrigation. Now the wheat young ears begin to differentiate, and nutrient requirements are urgent. Sufficient fertilizer and water must be supplied from the greening stage. However, in order to prevent excessive stem and leaf growth, excessive supply should not be provided. Under normal circumstances, a compound fast-acting fertilizer of nitrogen and phosphorus should be applied once during the greening period; at the same time, the timing of irrigation should be determined according to the soil moisture content (maintaining a water content of 70% is a standard for irrigation). Due to the low precipitation in winter in the north, in addition to fully irrigating winter water before winter, spring irrigation is generally required, because the seedlings are not large, and the amount of water does not need to be very large. There is more spring rain in the Yangtze River Basin, and water accumulates in the fields, so attention must be paid to drainage. Before jointing, a complete fast-acting fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium should be applied. If the soil moisture is insufficient after fertilization, it is necessary to irrigate once, and the amount of water can be larger at this time to promote ear differentiation and the growth of stems and leaves. The proper combination of the three types of fertilizers plays a mutual role in preventing lodging in high-yielding wheat. Pure nitrogen fertilizer should not be applied too much, and irrigation should not be too much or too early. This is the key to preventing lodging during this period.

The types of fertilizers that can be used include ammonium sulfate, human manure, or soil fertilizer made from saltpeter for nitrogen fertilizer; superphosphate for phosphate fertilizer; and wood ash, potassium sulfate, etc., and other soil fertilizers for potassium fertilizer.

Applying wood ash has a significant effect on preventing lodging. Wood ash is mainly fast-acting potassium, which is easily dissolved in water for wheat absorption. In 1958, our Mengxian working group conducted experiments in the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Mengxian County: when wheat was in the late jointing stage, 250 jin of wood ash were applied per mu. After observation after wind and rain, the wheat that applied wood ash only tilted slightly, while the unapplied wheat lodged significantly. Potassium fertilizer must be applied as early as possible. If it is applied after heading, the potassium fertilizer can only play the role of promoting nutrient transport and transformation of grains, and does not have a great effect on strengthening the stem.

Second, Rolling and Harrowing Wheat. After the topsoil dries during the greening period, rolling and harrowing wheat can be carried out. Generally, cohesive soil can be rolled first and then harrowed, looser soil can also be harrowed first and then rolled, sandy soil can be heavily rolled but not harrowed, and clay soil can be harrowed but not rolled. The effect of rolling and harrowing is to make the wheat roots and tillering nodes closely contact with the topsoil, strengthen the stem's supporting ability, and at the same time promote root development and extend deep into the soil. For the above-ground parts, it can prolong the differentiation time of the main stem young ears, grow large ears, shorten the internode length of the stems, and increase the leaves; and significantly promote tillering development, increase the number of ears, and make heading neat and consistent. These can prevent wheat lodging.

Third, Root Hilling. In the Yangtze River Basin, in broadcast wheat areas, because the soil covering is very shallow and the topsoil is humid, it is easy to lodge. After greening and jointing, dry fine river mud, pond mud, or wall soil should be used to hill the roots once or twice, covering a depth of about one inch. It is best to combine it with compaction after covering, which can enhance the root system, suppress some ineffective tillers, and at the same time supply some fast-acting nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer. In southern regions, this method plays an important role in preventing lodging.

Fourth, Pay Attention to Management During Heading and Flowering. When wheat grows to the heading and flowering stage, the weight of the upper part increases sharply. At this time, careful management should be taken to prevent lodging. Because this period is the most vigorous period of wheat growth, it consumes a lot of fertilizer and water, and the supply of fertilizer and water cannot be lacking, but it must be noted that the soil should not be too wet and soft. The experience of farmers in Henan Province is to fully irrigate once during the booting stage, intentionally avoid irrigating during the flowering stage, and start irrigating again when heading, flowering, and grain filling.

Fifth, Cutting Leaves and Thinning Seedlings. When wheat has signs of excessive growth and lodging, leaves can be cut to inhibit excessive growth; when necessary, seedlings can be appropriately thinned to facilitate ventilation and light transmission, and improve the growth of the base and roots. If the plants are too crowded, grow weakly, the leaf sheaths are elongated and soft, no tillers are produced, and the stems cannot support the plant and are in a prostrate state, more cutting can be done; when necessary, combine with appropriate thinning and inter-row tillage, topdressing and irrigation to make them regrow. If excessive growth occurs after jointing, the top leaves can be cut off by one-third to one-half to reduce the weight of the upper part. Last April, the Mengxian working group conducted a comparison between cutting leaves and not cutting leaves in the overly grown wheat fields in Wutong Village. The wheat seedlings that were not cut lodged, and the wheat plants with one-third of the top leaves cut off did not show significant lodging, and finally increased wheat production by 27% compared to those that were not cut. Cutting leaves is a last resort. If the growth is slightly excessive and only a small part is lodged afterwards, there is no need to cut leaves. According to experiments, cutting leaves of normally growing wheat affects the assimilation function of the plants and results in a yield reduction of 47% compared to those that are not cut.

Sixth, Apply Foliar Fertilizer to Lodged Wheat Plants. When wheat plants lodge, especially early lodging, the growth of the wheat plants is hindered, and the lower part of the stems is bent or broken, which affects nutrient transport. If foliar fertilization is carried out in time, good results can be obtained. In 1958, we conducted a comparison of spraying urine after lodging in Beijing and Mengxian (half urine and half water, 200 jin per mu), which proved that spraying urine increased production by about 8% and increased the thousand-grain weight by 6% compared to spraying water.

Seventh, Building Supports to Prevent Lodging and Binding After Lodging. According to our observations last year, building supports to prevent lodging can play a supporting role for wheat fields that grow well in the early stage and may lodge in the later stage. Therefore, high-yielding experimental fields should be supported to prevent lodging. Supports should be built early, before jointing, to avoid the wheat plants being trampled and injured after they grow up. The supports should be dense, strong, and stable, leaving walkways to facilitate later management. If the wheat has been severely lodged, building supports is not effective, but bundling can be carried out to avoid mildew and germination of the ears and grains. The bundles should be small and not too tight to avoid affecting the plants in the middle.

The above are all last resort measures. The most important thing is to prevent wheat lodging in the early stages.

    小麦倒伏是可以防止的
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    丰产田的小麦密度大，穗部重，如果小麦茎秆不相应增强，就要倒伏。如果管理措施跟得上，倒伏是可以防止的。
            倒伏的原因
    倒伏可以发生在小麦的不同时期。有在苗期就开始倒伏的，这多半由于耕层浅，根部发育不良，地面植株过挤，光线不透，温度高，湿度大，施氮肥过多，因而形成叶部狂长，叶鞘延长成为软“挺”，茎秆组织柔软，不能负荷叶部重量而倒伏。这种麦子若不设法补救很难正常生长。有的小麦在孕穗以后倒伏，这是由于茎秆基部节间生长不良，细胞间机械组织稀少，下皮层薄，细胞延长壁薄，茎秆支撑力小，所以在穗部形成以后，不能负荷而倒伏。一经倒伏，养分不能正常输送，同时被压挤在潮湿地面易于霉烂。
    有的小麦在灌浆后倒伏，也是由于茎秆支撑力不足，但这时倒伏损失较小，除了灌浆不好以外，还可能造成粒籽受湿发芽。小麦出穗后的倒伏，多由于暴风雨等外力摧残所引起，植株生长较健的，倒伏后还能自节部向上挺起，但原来生长不好或遇连雨天，就不易挺起了。
      培育根部强壮的植株
    防止倒伏，首先要给小麦根部造成良好发育条件。所以深耕细作，施用有机肥做基肥（施得多、施得匀），是保证丰产田小麦不倒伏的前提。同时播种量要合理，播种期要适时，以便让幼苗在冬前健全分蘖，次生根充分生长，打下健壮植株的基础。
    另外要注意选用秆强的优良品种。如北方地区可选用早洋麦，南方地区可选用南大2419，中农28号。
    当前防止倒伏的几种方法
    目前大地回春，小麦经过一冬潜伏，生机恢复，管理措施不当，很容易倒伏。下面是当前防止小麦倒伏的几种方法：
    第一，施肥灌水。现在小麦幼穗开始分化，养分需要殷切，必须从返青起即供给充分肥、水。但为了防止茎叶徒长，又不能供应过分。一般情况是，在返青期应追用氮磷混合速效肥一次；同时根据土壤水分多少来决定灌水迟早（保持水量70％是灌水的一个标准）。北方由于冬季降水量少，除了冬前饱灌冬水以外，一般都需春灌，因为幼苗不大，水量也不必很大。长江流域春雨较多，田间积水，必须注意排水问题。到拔节前应施含有氮磷钾三要素的完全速效肥，施肥后如果土壤水分不足，还须灌一次水，这时水量可以大些，以促进麦穗分化及生长茎叶。三种肥料的适当配合，对丰产小麦不倒伏是起着互相作用的。纯氮肥不可施用过多，灌水不能太多太早，这是这个时期预防倒伏的关键。
    施肥的种类，氮肥可用硫酸铵，人粪尿或硝土制成的土化肥；磷肥可用过磷酸钙；钾肥可用草木灰、硫酸钾等，以及其他的土化肥。
    施用草木灰对防止倒伏有显著效果。草木灰主要是速效钾，容易溶解在水中为小麦吸收。我所孟县工作组1958年在孟县明星农业社试验：当小麦在拔节后期，每亩施用草木灰二百五十斤，经过风雨后进行观察，施用草木灰的小麦只稍有倾斜，未施的则显著倒伏。施用钾肥，必须争取早施，如果在秀穗以后才施，钾肥只能起促进子粒养分运输与转化的效果，对增强茎秆作用不很大。
    第二，压麦耙麦。在返青期表土干燥之后，可以进行压麦耙麦，一般两合土壤可以先压后耙，较松的土壤也可先耙后压，沙土地可以重压不耙，粘土地可以耙而不压。压耙的作用可使麦根与分蘖节部与表土密接，加强茎秆支持能力，同时可促进根系发育，并向土壤深处伸长。对于地上部可以使主茎幼穗分化时间延长，生长大穗，缩短茎秆节间长度，增加叶片；并显著促进分蘖发育，使穗数增加，抽穗整齐一致。这些都可以防止小麦倒伏。
    第三，根部壅培。在长江流域一带撒播麦区，由于复土很浅，表土潮湿，很易倒伏。在返青拔节以后，应当用干细河泥塘泥或墙土在根部壅培一到两次，复深一寸左右，复后最好结合镇压，可以增强根系，并压掉一部无效分蘖，同时能供给一部速效氮磷肥分。在南方地区，用这种方法对防止倒伏起重要作用。
    第四，注意抽穗扬花期的管理。小麦生长到抽穗扬花时期，上部重量激增，这时要小心管理，慎防倒伏。由于这段时期是小麦生长最旺盛时期，消耗肥水很多，供应肥水不能缺少，但必须注意土壤不可过于湿软。河南省农民的经验，是在孕穗期饱灌一水，有意避开扬花一水，等到抽穗扬花灌浆时再开始灌水。
    第五，割叶和疏苗。在小麦已有徒长倒伏象征时，可以割叶，来抑制徒长；必要时酌量疏苗，以利通风透光，健全基部及根部生长。在幼苗时期若由于植株过挤，生长纤弱，叶鞘延长发软，不生分蘖，茎秆无力支持而陷披伏状态时，可以多割；必要时结合适当疏苗间苗，追肥灌水，使其重长苗。在拔节以后发生徒长，可将顶部叶片剪去三分之一到二分之一，以减轻上部重量。去年4月，孟县工作组曾将梧桐村徒长小麦田进行割叶与未割叶对比，凡未割叶的麦苗倒伏了，剪去顶叶三分之一的麦株，倒伏现象不显著，最后比不割叶的增产小麦27％。割叶是不得已的办法，如果生长略现徒长，事后只小部分有倒伏，就不必割叶了。据试验，生长正常的小麦，割叶后由于影响植株同化机能，反而较不割叶的要减产47％。
    第六，已倒伏麦株要进行根外追肥。麦株倒伏，特别是早期倒伏的，麦株生育受阻，茎秆下部弯曲或折伤，影响养分运转。如果及时进行叶部喷肥，会有良好效果。1958年，我们在北京及孟县两地进行倒伏后喷尿对比（尿水各半相混，每亩二百斤），证明喷尿的要比喷水增产8％左右，千粒重增加6％。
    第七，搭架防倒和倒伏后捆扎。根据我们去年观察，搭架防止倒伏，对前期生长好后期可能倒伏的麦田能起扶持作用，所以高额丰产试验田应当搭架来防倒伏。搭架要早，须在拔节前搭好，以免麦株长起后易被践踏受伤。搭架要密要牢要稳，留出走道，以利后期管理。如果小麦已经严重倒伏，搭架不易发生效果，但可以进行扶捆，以避免穗粒霉烂发芽。捆宜小，也不可太紧，以免中部植株受影响。
    以上所述都是不得已的办法，最重要的还是在早期预防麦株倒伏。
