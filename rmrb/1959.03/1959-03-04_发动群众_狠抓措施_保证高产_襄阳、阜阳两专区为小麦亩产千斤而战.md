Mobilize the Masses, Vigorously Implement Measures, Guarantee High Yields
Xiangyang and Fuyang Special Zones Fight for Wheat Yields of 1,000 Jin Per Mu
(Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan, March 3rd) The Xiangyang Special Zone's million-strong labor force is vigorously managing wheat fields, striving to guarantee the realization of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu and fighting to achieve a wheat yield of 1,500 jin per mu across the entire zone. The entire zone is focusing on "three guarantees" (guaranteeing numerous ears, guaranteeing large ears, and guaranteeing full grains) and conducting a major competition to win the banner for high wheat yields. The slogan of the entire zone is: "Externally fight against Jingzhou, internally fiercely chase Guanghua." The 156 people's communes in the 14 counties and cities of the entire zone are divided into 49 competition zones. Many people's communes have also held pledge rallies. After the CCP Zao yang County Committee proposed a call to add another 200 dan of fertilizer per mu of wheat field at a county-wide broadcast meeting, the entire county mobilized 200,000 laborers and accumulated more than 13 million dan of fertilizer and applied fertilizer to more than 40,000 mu in two days. In order to catch up with Guanghua, GuCheng not only launched a mass "learn from Guanghua, catch up with Guanghua" discussion, but also the county party committee first secretary led the county's commune party secretaries and labor models to visit Guanghua. GuCheng was last year's highest wheat yield county in the province. This year, after putting forward the slogan "learn from Guanghua, catch up with Guanghua," some cadres and the masses were still not convinced. After visiting the site and seeing that Guanghua's wheat seedlings were indeed growing well, everyone immediately became nervous and quickly launched a competition upsurge throughout the county to guarantee the wheat red banner county.

Currently, the 8 million mu of wheat in the entire zone is generally growing vigorously. According to inspections, most wheat fields have more than 500,000 seedlings per mu, and those with less than 300,000 seedlings per mu account for only 20%. In order to further promote large-scale balanced production increase, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee recently held a wheat technology meeting with the participation of county party secretaries, agricultural labor models, and agricultural technical cadres, focusing on the main measures from now until the wheat matures. The meeting unanimously agreed that from now until the "Spring Equinox" is an important period for wheat growth, and it is necessary to provide the wheat seedlings with sufficient nutrients and water to allow the seedlings to develop better and have more effective tillers. For this reason, it is necessary to seize the time to apply a large amount of fertilizer before the "Spring Equinox". The meeting also specifically studied the amount and method of topdressing for various seedlings. Based on last year's experience, it was particularly emphasized that "rational topdressing, topdressing according to the seedlings." For Type III seedlings lacking nitrogen fertilizer, well-rotted cattle manure or liquid manure should be applied; for wheat seedlings with a tendency to lodge or that grow too vigorously in winter, focus on applying phosphate and potash fertilizers and superphosphate; for experimental fields that are too dense or growing too vigorously, in addition to focusing on applying phosphate and potash fertilizers, foliar application of phosphate fertilizer can also be carried out to enhance lodging resistance and increase grain weight. In addition, it is necessary to grasp soil loosening and weeding, conserve moisture and fight drought, and do a good job in preventing insects, diseases, late frost damage, and trampling by birds and animals.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, dispatch: The CCP Anhui Provincial Fuyang Prefectural Committee has put forward a call to the people of the entire special zone to strive to double this year's grain output and realize the goal of a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu and a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu in the special zone.

At the recent enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, the Fuyang Prefectural Committee analyzed the favorable conditions for achieving this year's agricultural production increase targets: First, the special zone's total grain output last year increased by one-fold compared to 1957, which not only gained experience in increasing production, but also enabled cadres at all levels to accumulate a set of experiences in leading mass production and organizing production. Second, the superiority of the people's commune being both large and public; the revolutionary drive of the broad masses has become even greater. Third, this year's summer harvest crops were grasped early, the foundation was sufficient, and management was good. Wheat fields are generally deep-plowed more than seven inches, with more than 500 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu and more than 30 jin of seeds sown; after the wheat was sown, management was strengthened in a timely manner, and topdressing and irrigation were carried out in a timely manner. Fourth, the special zone's construction of river network projects has achieved great results; fertilizers and seeds are also better than in previous years.

The meeting also put forward a series of measures to strive to achieve the targets, pointing out that to achieve a greater leap forward this year, it is first necessary to continue to implement putting politics in command. Immediately launch a large-scale publicity, inspection, and competition throughout the special zone to fully boost the revolutionary drive of all cadres and the masses and mobilize all positive factors. Mobilize each commune, team, and member to formulate leap forward plans, and organize a major production competition between counties, communes, teams, and members. Secondly, party committees at all levels must take agricultural production as the leadership center, and the production of wheat, rice, sweet potatoes, cotton, etc., must be the responsibility of the secretaries in charge; finance and trade, culture and education, industry and transportation, and other departments must arrange business work around agricultural production and serve agricultural production to ensure that the whole party and the whole people are twisted into one rope and fight with all their strength to realize the grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu and the wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu in the special zone. Third, cadres at all levels must conscientiously participate in labor, and cadres at the prefecture, county, commune, and team levels must all cultivate experimental fields, and adopt methods such as inspection and evaluation, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, and organizing on-site visits, so that one production upsurge follows another. Fourth, grasp wheat field management so that the output of summer harvest crops and spring-sown crops accounts for about 70% of the total grain output for the year. At present, it is necessary to take fertilizer as the commander and vigorously carry out field management of summer harvest crops and preparation for spring plowing. It is required to accumulate more farmyard manure and vigorously develop local chemical fertilizers to ensure that 3,000 dan of farmyard manure and 200 jin of local chemical fertilizer are applied per mu, and to ensure that there is sufficient fertilizer and sufficient water. Fifth, prepare for spring plowing, quickly repair and add tools, and vigorously carry out tool reforms to ensure timely spring sowing. Sixth, seize the time to build water conservancy projects, resolutely complete the river network task, and require that there be no drought in the event of a major drought and no breach in the event of a major flood.

    发动群众　狠抓措施　保证高产
    襄阳、阜阳两专区为小麦亩产千斤而战
    本报武汉3日电　襄阳专区百万劳动大军大抓麦田管理，为保证实现小麦亩产千斤，力争全区亩产小麦一千五百斤而奋战。全区正以“三保”（保穗多、保穗大、保籽粒饱满）为中心，开展一个争夺小麦丰产红旗的大竞赛。全专区的口号是：“对外大战荆州，对内猛追光化”。全区十四个县、市的一百五十六个人民公社，划分为四十九个竞赛区。许多人民公社还召开了誓师大会。中共枣阳县委在全县广播大会上提出每亩麦田再追二百担肥的号召后，全县出动二十万劳力，两天时间积肥一千三百多万担，追肥四万多亩。谷城为了赶光化，不仅开展一个群众性的“学光化、赶光化”的讨论，还由县委第一书记带领全县公社党委书记、劳动模范到光化参观。谷城去年是全省小麦单产的最高县，今年提出“学光化、赶光化”口号后，有的干部和群众还不服气。现场参观后，看到光化的麦苗确实生长好，大家立即紧张起来，很快就在全县范围内掀起一个保小麦红旗县的竞赛高潮。
    目前全专区八百万亩小麦普遍生长茁壮。据检查，大多数麦田每亩已有苗五十万株以上，每亩不到三十万株的只占20％。为了进一步促进大面积平衡增产，最近襄阳地委又召开了有各县县委书记、农业劳动模范和农业技术干部参加的小麦技术会议，着重研究了从现在到小麦成熟期间的主要措施。会上一致认为，从现在到“春分”，是小麦生长的重要时期，必须供应麦苗以充分养料和水分，使幼苗发育得更好，有效分蘖多。为此必须在“春分”前抓紧大追一次肥。会上还具体研究了各种苗的追肥分量和方法。根据去年经验，特别强调要“合理追肥、看苗追肥”。对缺乏氮肥的三类苗，要加施腐熟牛栏粪或水粪；对有倒伏趋势或冬季生长过旺的麦苗，着重施磷钾肥和过磷酸钙；对生长过密过旺的试验田，除着重追施磷钾肥外，还可进行根外追磷肥，以增强抗倒伏能力，提高籽粒重量。此外要抓松土除草，保墒抗旱，做好防虫、防病、防晚霜冻害和防禽兽糟踏。
    据新华社合肥电　中共安徽省阜阳地委向全专区人民提出了力争今年粮食翻一番，实现全区粮食亩产双千斤和小麦千斤专区的号召。
    阜阳地委在最近召开的常委扩大会议上，分析了今年实现农业增产指标的有利条件：一、去年专区粮食总产量比1957年增产一倍，不但获得增产经验，还使各级干部积累了一套领导群众生产和组织生产的经验。二、人民公社既大又公的优越性；广大群众的革命干劲更大了。三、今年夏收作物抓得早，先天足，管理得好。小麦田一般深耕七寸以上，每亩施基肥五百多担，下种三十多斤；小麦种下之后又及时加强了管理，并适时地进行了追肥、灌溉。四、全区兴修河网化工程取得很大成绩；肥料、种子也比往年好。
    会议还提出一系列的力争实现指标的措施，指出要实现今年更大的跃进，首先要继续贯彻政治挂帅。立即在全专区范围内开展大宣传、大检查、大竞赛，把全体干部和群众的革命干劲鼓足，把一切积极因素调动起来。发动每个社、队和每个社员制订跃进计划，组织县与县、社与社、队与队、社员与社员之间的生产大竞赛。其次，各级党委要把农业生产作为领导中心，小麦、水稻、甘薯、棉花等生产都要由书记分工负责；财贸、文教、工交等各部门，都要围绕农业生产安排业务工作，为农业生产服务，以保证做到全党全民拧成一股绳，全力为实现粮食双千斤和小麦千斤专区而战。第三，各级干部都要认真参加劳动，地、县、社、队的干部，人人种试验田，并采取检查评比、抓两头带中间、组织现场参观等办法，使生产上一个高潮接上一个高潮。第四，抓小麦田间管理，使夏收作物和春种作物的产量，占全年粮食总产量的70％左右。当前要以肥料挂帅大搞夏收作物的田间管理和备耕工作。要求多积农家肥，大搞土化肥，保证每亩施三千担农家肥，二百斤土化肥，保证做到肥足、水足。五、作好春耕准备，迅速修理添置工具，大搞工具改革，保证春种适时。六、抓紧兴修水利，坚决完成河网化任务，要求做到：大旱不受干，大水不破圩。
