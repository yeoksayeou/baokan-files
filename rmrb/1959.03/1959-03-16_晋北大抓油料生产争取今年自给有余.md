Datong, March 15th. The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province, which has historically been unable to produce enough oil to meet its own needs, is currently carrying out a mass campaign to boost oil production. This year, the entire special district aims to fundamentally "pass the test" in oil production, achieving not only self-sufficiency but also selling large quantities to the state to support other regions.

At present, activities organizing the entire population to participate in oil production have been widely launched. The CPC Jinbei District Committee has made a decision to "pass the test" in oil production this year and has formulated a plan and measures for developing oil production throughout the district. This year, the entire special district plans to produce a total of over 260 million jin of oil, exceeding last year's total oil production by two to three times. After realizing this plan, the average person in the special district will have 63 jin of oil.

Recently, Xin'ding County shared the high-yield experience of Dingxiang area in planting sunflowers on alkaline land last year, and will launch a campaign in the county for each person to obtain an average of 100 jin of sunflower seeds. It is necessary to help the Jiangcun Heping People's Commune become a commune with an average yield of 1,000 jin of sunflower seeds per mu, and use this as a key point to timely summarize experience to guide the entire county. In the Luliang mountainous area, Wuzhai County, at a recent conference of over a thousand cadres, the topic of "raising the value of oil crops and achieving a simultaneous leap forward in grain and oil" was repeatedly discussed to unify thinking, explore measures, and formulate plans, proposing to plant a large amount of flax. In the spirit of seizing oil production early, all localities have begun spring planting preparations such as seed allocation, fertilizer preparation, farmland planning, and technical training.

The CPC Jinbei District Committee's grand plan for oil production was proposed after analyzing the new situation in agricultural production this year. The Yanbei and Jinxi areas of the Jinbei Special District are well-known low-yield areas in the country. In the past, grain yields were low, and oil yields were even lower. Last year's agricultural leap forward transformed Jinbei Special District's grain production from low-yield to high-yield. With this huge change, and the continuous growth of industrial construction and people's living needs, the oil issue has become increasingly necessary to solve. The District Committee believes that there are many favorable conditions for further expanding the oil planting area and launching a high-yield oil campaign in the Jinbei area: the land here is vast, and there are many saline-alkali and low-lying lands that can be planted with oil crops; the rational use of land after communization and the further implementation of the basic farmland system provide a guarantee for expanding the oil planting area. There are many varieties of flax, sunflowers, hemp, yellow mustard, black mustard, and small hemp planted in the Jinbei Special District, and farmers have relatively rich experience. Many areas achieved high yields last year. Zizhai Township in Wuzhai County achieved a high yield of 116 jin per mu of flax in high-yield fields. Xin'ding County had more than 12 mu of sunflowers with yields of 1,000 to 1,400 jin per mu. These experiences will be the wealth to promote oil production this year.

While formulating this year's oil production leap forward targets, leading departments at all levels have generally conducted serious and meticulous research on many powerful measures to ensure the realization of the targets. The entire special district will select 1.41 million mu of basic farmland as oil bases, and will also select 350,000 mu of non-basic farmland as auxiliary oil fields. It is necessary to use all available methods to expand the oil planting area, such as intercropping between trees and oil crops; and to mobilize all 4.1 million people in the district to use open spaces in front of houses, next to houses, in courtyards, and along roads to plant sunflowers and other oil crops. In order to ensure high oil yields, the CPC Jinbei District Committee, in addition to requiring all localities to completely change the idea of ​​underestimating oil crops and the practice of treating oil crops unfavorably by planting them on bad land, not fertilizing, not processing, and not planting densely, also summarized farmers' experience combined with science and technology to formulate a plan for the district to innovate oil crop cultivation techniques. 1. Actively expand the oil planting area; 2. Fertilize reasonably according to the oil crops. Each mu of land should be fertilized with at least 20,000 jin of base fertilizer, and more top dressing should be added during the peak seedling period; 3. Process more according to different seasons; 4. Plant reasonably densely, increasing the sowing amount per mu from 3 jin in the past to 6 to 8 jin. In order to ensure that oil crops are sown in time, Xin'ding and other counties are preparing to determine "Oil Planting Days" by commune and team to concentrate manpower and material resources to carry out a concentrated planting campaign.

Thoughts of Value are the First Hurdle

The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province's emphasis on oil production and bringing oil production to the agenda early, putting oil on an equal footing with grain and cotton, is a great thing.

Experience has proved that "planting oil crops in thought" is the first hurdle in developing oil production. Only by passing this hurdle can oil crops gain their due status, change the unfair treatment of letting oil crops occupy bad land, not eating enough (less fertilization), and not drinking enough (less watering), and pave the way for a leap forward in oil production.

The sowing of crops is imminent. While preparing for grain and cotton production early, preparations should also be made for oil production as early as possible.

    晋北大抓油料生产争取今年自给有余
    本报大同15日电　历来油料不能自给的山西省晋北专区，目前正开展全民抓油料生产运动。今年要使全专区油料生产从根本上“过关”，除油料自给外，还要大量售给国家，支援外地。
    目前，组织全民参加油料生产的活动已普遍开展起来。中共晋北地委已作出了今年油料“过关”的决定，并制定出全区发展油料生产的计划和措施。今年全专区计划总产油料二亿六千多万斤，比去年油料总产量超过二倍到三倍。实现这一计划后，全专区每人将平均有油料六十三斤。
    最近，忻定县交流了定襄地区去年利用碱地种植向日葵的高产经验，将在全县开展每人平均拿到百斤葵花籽运动；要帮助蒋村和平人民公社成为向日葵平均亩产千斤社，并以此为重点，及时总结经验指导全县。吕梁山区五寨县在最近举行的千余名干部大会上，以“提高油料身价，让粮油齐跃进”为题，反复讨论，统一思想，挖掘措施，制定计划，提出要大种胡麻。各地本着及早抓油料的精神，都开始了调种、准备肥料、规划耕地、技术训练等春播准备工作。
    中共晋北地委油料生产的宏伟计划，是分析了今年农业生产新形势后提出的。晋北专区的雁北、晋西北一带都是闻名全国的低产区，过去粮食产量低，油料产量更低。去年农业大跃进，晋北专区粮食生产已经由低产变高产。随着这一巨大变化，以及工业建设和人民生活需要的不断增长，油料问题就越来越需要解决了。地委认为，晋北地区进一步扩大油料种植面积和开展油料高产运动有许多有利条件：这里土地辽阔，有许多盐碱下湿地可以种油料；公社化后合理使用土地，进一步实行基本农田制度，更为扩大油料种植面积提供了保证。晋北专区种植胡麻、向日葵、大麻、黄芥、黑芥、小麻品种很多，农家经验比较丰富。许多地区在去年获得了高额丰产，五寨县紫寨乡胡麻高产田亩产到一百一十六斤，忻定县有十二亩多向日葵亩产千斤到一千四百斤，这些经验都将是促进今年油料生产的财富。
    各级领导部门在制定今年油料跃进指标的同时，普遍认真细致地研究了许多确保实现指标的有力措施。全专区要选择一百四十一万亩基本农田作为油料基地，并要选择三十五万亩非基本农田作为油料辅助田。要利用一切可以利用的办法扩大油料种植面积，如林木和油料间作等；还要发动全区四百一十万人，人人动手利用房前、宅旁、庭院、路边等空地种葵花和其它油料。中共晋北地委为了确保油料高产，除了要各地彻底改变轻视油料思想和不往好地种、不施肥、不加工、不密植的偏待油料作法；并总结农家经验结合科学技术，制定了全区革新油料耕作技术的方案。一、积极扩大油料面积；二、根据油料合理施肥，每亩地起码要求施底肥两万斤，盛苗期多增加追肥；三、根据不同季节多加工；四、合理密植，每亩播种量由过去三斤提高到六至八斤。忻定等县为了保证油料及时下种，准备按社、按队确定“种植油料日”，集中人力、物力突击播种。思想重视是第一关
    山西省晋北专区大抓油料生产，及早地把油料生产提到议事日程上来，让油料和粮、棉平起平坐，是一件大好事情。
    经验证明：“在思想上种油料”是发展油料生产的第一关。只有把这一关过好，油料才能得到它应有的地位，才能改变让油料占坏地、吃不饱（少施肥）、喝不足（少浇水）等等不平等待遇，才能为油料生产大跃进铺平道路。
    农作物播种已是迫在眉睫的事。在提早进行粮棉生产准备工作的同时，也应为油料生产及早地进行准备。
