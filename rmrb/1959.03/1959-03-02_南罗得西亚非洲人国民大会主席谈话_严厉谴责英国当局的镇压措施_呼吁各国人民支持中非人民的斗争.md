Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 28th - Nkomo, Chairman of the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, said at a press conference today that the British colonial authorities' move to ban the African National Congress was illegal and an attempt to stifle the political voice of the majority in order to perpetuate colonial rule.

The four organizations of the African National Congress in Central Africa were declared "illegal" organizations by the colonial authorities on February 26. At the same time, many leaders and staff members of the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress were arrested.

Nkomo condemned the repressive measures of the colonial authorities, believing them to be "a blatant violation of the basic human rights stipulated in the United Nations Charter."

Nkomo said that the Southern Rhodesian authorities, after declaring a "state of emergency," proceeded to arrest and brutally abuse 500 members of the African National Congress because they feared the strength of the African National Congress. Because the African National Congress is fighting for human rights and universal adult suffrage, and fighting against unjust land laws and racial discrimination.

Nkomo said that the establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was against the wishes of the Africans, and now the colonial authorities are trying to make this "federation" autonomous by white "immigrants." If this attempt is realized, it would mean that the three territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland would become a second South African Federation, where a small number of white "immigrants" rule over millions of African people, keeping them in a state of perpetual enslavement.

Nkomo demanded that the British government dissolve the so-called "federation" and allow Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia to be autonomous under the African people who constitute the vast majority of the population. He also demanded that the Southern Rhodesian colonial authorities lift the "state of emergency," release all detained Africans, and revoke the ban on the African National Congress.

Nkomo called on the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference and its Secretariat, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committees of various countries, and world public opinion to mobilize the people to protest the measures of the British colonialists and support the struggle of his country. Nkomo also called on the independent countries of Africa to immediately provide assistance to their struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, London - The British public is currently showing increasing concern about the situation in Central Africa, where British colonialists are intensifying the suppression of the African people's movement for independence.

Labor MP Brockway said at a rally in London tonight that the struggle in Nyasaland has now spread to the entire Central African region because Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Whitehead has taken provocative actions, banning all African organizations, arresting 400 leaders, and declaring a state of emergency.

    南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会主席谈话
    严厉谴责英国当局的镇压措施
    呼吁各国人民支持中非人民的斗争
    新华社开罗28日电　南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会主席恩科莫今天在记者招待会上说，英国殖民当局取缔非洲人国民大会的举动是非法的，并且是企图扼杀大多数人的政治喉舌，而想使殖民统治永远存在。
    中非的非洲人国民大会四个组织在2月26日被殖民当局宣布为
  “非法的”组织。同时，南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会许多领袖和工作人员被逮捕。
    恩科莫谴责了殖民当局的镇压措施，他认为这是“悍然侵犯联合国宪章中规定的基本人权”。
    恩科莫说，南罗得西亚当局在宣布“紧急状态”后，接着就逮捕和非常残酷地虐待非洲人国民大会的五百名成员，这是由于他们害怕非洲人国民大会的力量。因为非洲人国民大会正在为人权和普遍的成年人选举权而斗争，为反对不公正的土地法和种族歧视而斗争。
    恩科莫说，成立罗得西亚—尼亚萨兰联邦是违反非洲人的愿望的，现在殖民当局又企图使这个“联邦”由白种“移民”自治，如果这一企图实现的话，那就意味着，南、北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰这三块领土变成第二个南非联邦，在那里一小撮白色“移民”统治着千百万非洲人民。使他们永远处于被奴役的状态。
    恩科莫要求英国政府解散所谓“联邦”，让尼亚萨兰和北罗得西亚由占人口绝大多数的非洲人实行自治。他还要求南罗得西亚殖民当局取消“紧急状态”，释放所有被拘留的非洲人，并撤销对非洲人国民大会的禁令。
    恩科莫呼吁全非人民大会常设秘书处、亚非人民团结大会和它的书记处、各国亚非团结委员会、以及世界舆论，起来动员人民抗议英国殖民者的措施，并支持他的国家的斗争。恩科莫还号召非洲的独立国家立即对他们的斗争提供帮助。
    据新华社伦敦电　英国公众目前对于中非的局势表示愈来愈大的关心，在那里英国殖民主义者正在加紧镇压非洲人民争取独立运动。
    工党议员布罗克威今晚在伦敦的一次大会上说，由于南罗得西亚总理怀特赫德采取挑衅性的行动，禁止所有的非洲人组织，逮捕了四百名领导人，并且宣布紧急状态，尼亚萨兰的斗争现在已经扩大到整个中非地区。
