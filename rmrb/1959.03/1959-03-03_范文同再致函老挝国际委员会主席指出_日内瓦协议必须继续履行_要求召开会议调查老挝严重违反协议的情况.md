Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 2nd: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today published a letter from Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to Lieutenant General Tara Singh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, dated February 23.

In this letter, following his letter to Singh Bal on January 19, 1959, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong once again called Singh Bal's attention to the worrying situation in Laos and expressed his hope that the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos would convene a meeting of the commission as soon as possible to continue the investigation of events that have violated the Geneva Accords, in order to ensure the full implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos and to make a positive contribution to maintaining peace and security in Laos and neighboring countries.

In this letter, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong first pointed out that violations of the provisions of the Geneva Accords on Laos have not only not ceased but have continued to occur more seriously. Persecution, retaliation, and discrimination against former resistance personnel continue to occur. The US imperialists are sending more and more military personnel and new weapons to Laos, and the Royal Lao Army continues to infringe upon the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The letter stated that after the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference clarified their views on the existence and activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos on January 31, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Phoui Sananikone, issued a statement on February 11, 1959, saying that the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos had been completed, that the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos no longer had any reason to exist, and that the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos was unrelated to the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam considers the recent actions of the Royal Lao Government and the statement of the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government on February 11, 1959, to be very serious, as they violate Articles 6, 7, 9, and 15 of the Lao Ceasefire Agreement and Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone's statement also violates the provisions of Article 30 of the Lao Ceasefire Agreement, which stipulates that, depending on changes in the situations in Cambodia and Vietnam, the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos may gradually reduce its activities after obtaining the consent of the International Supervisory and Control Commissions for Cambodia and Vietnam. However, this resolution must be adopted unanimously.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong pointed out in the letter that the purpose of these actions is to conspire to undermine the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos, obstruct the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, allow the United States to increasingly invade Laos, turn Laos into a US military base, and pave the way for Laos to join the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Obviously, the Royal Lao Government has seriously violated the agreement it signed itself.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong reiterated in the letter that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Geneva Accords on Laos must continue to be implemented and that this agreement has nothing to do with the United Nations. The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos should continue to operate, and the Royal Lao Government has a responsibility to continue to strictly and fully implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords on Laos.

The letter said that faced with the aforementioned worrying situation in Laos, as a party to the Geneva Accords on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, it cannot turn a blind eye to the aforementioned violations of the Geneva Accords on Laos.

    范文同再致函老挝国际委员会主席指出
    日内瓦协议必须继续履行
    要求召开会议调查老挝严重违反协议的情况
    新华社河内2日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天发表了越南民主共和国政府总理兼外交部长范文同2月23日写给老挝国际委员会主席塔拉·辛格·巴尔中将的一封信。
    范文同总理继1959年1月19日写给辛格·巴尔一封信之后，在这封信中再一次要求辛格·巴尔注意老挝目前令人忧虑的局势，并且希望这位老挝国际委员会主席及早召开这个委员会的会议，对已经发生的违反日内瓦协议事件继续调查，以保证关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议获得完满的执行，为维护老挝及邻近国家的和平和安全作出积极的贡献。
    范文同总理在这封信中首先指出，违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议各项条款的事件不但没有终止，而且更加严重地在继续发生。对前抗战人员的迫害、报复和歧视仍旧不断地在发生。美帝国主义向老挝派遣的军事人员和运进的新武器越来越多，老挝王国军队仍然继续侵犯越南民主共和国的领土。
    信中说，在日内瓦会议两位主席1月31日就老挝国际停战监督和监察委员会的存在和活动问题阐明了自己的观点之后，老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空在1959年2月11日发表声明说，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行已经完成，老挝国际监督和监察委员会再没有存在的理由，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行，同关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的履行无关。越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝王国政府最近的行动和老挝王国政府首相1959年2月11日的声明非常严重，它违反了老挝停止敌对行动协定第六、七、九和十五条以及日内瓦会议最后宣言第四、第五条。培·萨纳尼空首相的声明还违反了老挝停止敌对行动协定第三十条的规定，即：根据柬埔寨和越南的情况的变化，老挝国际监督和监察委员会在征得柬埔寨和越南的国际监督和监察委员会的同意之后，可以逐渐减少其活动。但这个决议必须取得一致的通过。
    范文同总理在信中指出，这些行为的目的是阴谋破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的继续履行，阻挠老挝国际停战监督和监察委员会的活动，让美国日益侵入老挝，变老挝为美国的军事基地，为老挝加入东南亚侵略集团开辟道路。显然，老挝王国政府严重地违反了它自己签订的协议。
    范文同总理在信中再一次申明，越南民主共和国政府认为，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议必须继续履行，这个协议同联合国无关。老挝国际监督和监察委员会还应当继续活动，老挝王国政府有责任继续严正地、完满地履行有关老挝问题的日内瓦协议的各项条款。
    信中说，面临上述已形成的令人担忧的老挝局势，作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国的邻国，对上述违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的行为不能视若无睹。
