Xinhua News Agency, March 24th dispatch from New York: According to a report in the American "Worker's Weekly" on the 22nd, U.S. Senators Byrd and Randolph revealed in a report to the U.S. Senate on March 10th that there is currently severe unemployment and hunger in West Virginia. Byrd and Randolph are members of the Production and Stabilization Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, and they conducted an investigation into the economic situation of the state in Morgantown, Charles Town, and Beckley, West Virginia, from March 4th to 6th.

Senator Byrd called the Senate's attention to the "grim and disheartening suffering being experienced" in the region.

He said, "Although I was already aware of the despair of the unemployed, I was still shocked as never before when I left there." He said, "The sad stories that people repeatedly told were that thousands of able-bodied men who are capable of working and eager to work are forced to be idle, watching themselves and their families sink further into terrible poverty."

Byrd said that 13.6% of West Virginia's male and female workers—that is, one in every eight people—have no source of livelihood. Many of these people receive nothing at all because they have already exhausted their relief funds or are not eligible to receive relief in the first place.

Byrd said that business officials have confirmed that retail sales have declined significantly—in some cities, retail sales of some commodities have fallen by as much as 35%. Judicial authorities have confirmed that in severely affected areas, criminal behavior and thefts of food and clothing are increasing. In some families, fathers have abandoned their families in order to make their wives and children eligible for living allowances under the state's social relief program.

Byrd said that throughout the state, a shadow is looming over the residents as dangerously as during the terrible economic depression of 1930.

Byrd emphasized in his report that for these distressed and helpless people, this is almost a matter of life and death. Some honest, hardworking couples suddenly see a house that they have been paying for half their lives about to no longer belong to them.

Byrd emphasized that even in the 1930s, the desperation and dejection that they are seeing in West Virginia today did not exist among the shadowed residents. He said, "I think I can honestly say… that in West Virginia today, in terms of living standards, people are in a worse situation than they were in 1930."

Senator Randolph added, "In the valleys and hillsides of our state of West Virginia, the people are in dire need of food."

An article by "Wall Street Journal" reporter Loules described the tragic plight of unemployed miners in West Virginia. Loules wrote: "Many miners, still in their prime, have almost no hope of getting any other work in the mines. The mechanization of the mines and the decreasing consumer needs have deprived thousands of miners of their jobs."

Loules wrote, "West Virginia has become an economic disaster area. The state has 15% of its labor force, or 500,000 people, out of work."

Loules described the life today in the Haitop mining area of the Chris-Clicco watershed. He wrote, "Even in prosperous times, the dark, coal-ash-filled cottages look even dimmer. Many huts are tilting and some have completely collapsed. The Chris-Clicco watershed used to be a bustling area with more than 5,000 residents, and now there are less than half that number left, of which less than 300 are working in the mines. Most of the rest are unemployed."

Loules wrote that many miners have had to leave their homes to find work in other states, only to have to return home empty-handed in the end.

    失业和饥饿的惨状遍地皆是
    绝望和痛苦的呼声到处可闻
    美国西弗吉尼亚州人民生活的悲惨处境
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：据美国“工人周报”22日报道，美国参议员伯德和伦道夫3月10日在美国参议院所作的报告中透露说，现在在西弗吉尼亚州存在着严重的失业和饥饿的情况。伯德和伦道夫是美国参议院生产和稳定小组委员会的委员，他们3月4日至6日曾在西弗吉尼亚州摩根城、查斯斯敦和贝克利就这个州的经济情况进行了调查。
    参议员伯德提请参议院注意这一地区“遭受到的严酷而且令人沮丧的痛苦的情况。”
    他说：“虽然我对于失业者的绝望心情已早有所闻，但是当我离开那里时仍感到前所未有的惊骇。”他说，“人们讲了又讲的悲痛的故事是，数以千计的能够工作而且渴望工作的身强力壮的人们，不得不闲散着，眼看自己和他们的家庭进一步陷入可怕的贫困之中。”
    伯德说，西弗吉尼亚州的男女工人中有13.6％——即每八个人中就有一个人——没有生活来源。这些人当中有许多人由于已经用完了他们的救济金或者没有资格首先领取救济金而根本什么也得不到。
    伯德说，商业官员证实，零售量已经大大下降——在某些城市，某些商品零售量下降了35％之多。司法当局证实，在受影响严重的地区，犯法行为以及偷窃粮食和衣服的行为日益增加。在一些家庭里，父亲遗弃了自己的家庭，为的是使自己的妻儿有资格根据本州社会救济计划取得生活补助费。
    伯德说，在整个州里，笼罩着各地居民的阴影和1930年可怕的经济萧条时期一样危险。
    伯德在他的报告中强调说，在这些遭难的、无法可想的人们中，这差不多是一个生死存亡的问题。一些耿直、勤劳的夫妇突然看到半辈子一直在付款的一所房子要不属他们所有了。
    伯德着重指出，甚至在三十年代的时候，在笼罩在阴影中的居民中也不存在今天他们在西弗吉尼亚所看到的那种绝望和垂头丧气的情绪。他说，我想我可以老老实实地说……在今天的西弗吉尼亚，就生活水平而论，人民处在比1930年的日子更不如的情况之中。”
    参议员伦道夫也补充说：“在我们西弗吉尼亚州的谷地和山坡地带，人民非常需要粮食。”
    “华尔街日报”发表的该报记者娄累斯的一篇报道叙述了西弗吉尼亚州失业矿工的悲惨处境。娄累斯写道：“许多矿工还在盛年的时候就几乎没有希望在矿井里得到任何其他工作。矿井的机械化和日益减少的消费需要剥夺了成千上万矿工的工作。”
    娄累斯写道，“西弗吉尼亚成了经济上的严重灾难区。这个州有15％的劳动力，即五十万人没有工作。”
    娄累斯描绘了克利斯—克利科流域海托普矿工区的今日生活。他写道，“甚至在繁荣时期也是阴暗的、满是煤灰的茅舍，显得更加暗淡了。许多小屋东倒西歪，有的已经完全倒塌。克利斯—克利科流域过去曾经是一个繁华区，有五千多居民，现在剩下的居民还不到这个数字的一半，其中在矿井有工作的不到三百人。其余大部分都是失业者”。
    娄累斯写道，许多矿工为了到其他各州去找工作不得不背井离乡，而最后又不得不两手空空返回家园。
