Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Notice from the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

It is hereby announced that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique have long been colluding with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, plotting rebellion. For a long time, they have been gathering and condoning bandits, who have roamed around, disrupted transportation, robbed merchants and travelers, raped, burned, killed, and harmed the people. The Central Government, bearing in mind its magnanimous attitude, has repeatedly ordered the Tibetan local government to severely punish the rioters and maintain social order. However, the Tibetan local government has been feigning compliance, not only failing to quell the rebellion, but also condoning and supporting it, thereby fueling the arrogance of the bandits. As of March 10th this year, most of the Kalons in Tibet and the upper-class reactionary clique have further joined forces with the bandits, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, torn up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, openly betrayed the motherland, and undermined unity; openly killed Kanqiong Soilang Jiangcuo, a Tibetan official of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and injured Sangpo Cewang Renqin, deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, and others; and openly launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa on the night of March 19th. Their crimes are heinous. In order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities, and to relieve the suffering of the people in the Tibetan region, our army is ordered to suppress the rebellion. It is hoped that all Tibetan monks, nuns, and people will actively assist our army in suppressing the rebellion, not harboring bandits, not providing resources to the enemy, and not informing the bandits. Our army will adhere to the policy of leniency and differentiate among the rioters: those who abandon the bandits and return will not be held accountable for their past actions; those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded; all prisoners will be treated with leniency, without killing, insulting, beating, or searching their pockets; those who are stubbornly unrepentant and resolutely resist will be severely punished. Our army is strictly disciplined, safeguards the interests of the masses, protects agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, ensures fair trade, does not take a single needle or thread from the masses, respects the religious beliefs and customs of the masses, protects Lama temples, and protects cultural relics and historical sites. It is hoped that all monks, nuns, and people will live and work in peace and contentment, and refrain from listening to rumors and causing mutual alarm. This notice is hereby issued!

    藏军区布告全藏僧俗人民
    协助人民解放军讨平叛逆
    对于叛乱分子，将本宽大政策，区别对待
    新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军西藏军区布告
    查西藏地方政府与上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和国外反动分子，图谋叛乱，由来已久。长期以来，他们即纠集和纵容叛匪，窜扰各地，破坏交通，劫掠商旅，奸淫烧杀，残害人民，中央本着宽大为怀的态度，一再责成西藏地方政府，严惩叛乱分子，维护社会治安。但是西藏地方政府，阳奉阴违，不但不负责平息叛乱，反而纵容支持，助长叛匪气焰。及至今年三月十日，西藏多数噶伦与上层反动集团，更进一步与叛匪结成一体，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，公然背叛祖国，破坏统一；公然杀死西藏自治区筹备委员会藏族官员堪穷索朗降措，打伤西藏军区副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增等人；并且公然于三月十九日夜间向驻拉萨的人民解放军发动全面进攻。罪大恶极，莫此为甚。为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，解救西藏地区人民的疾苦，本军奉命讨伐，平息叛乱。望全藏僧俗人民，积极协助本军，讨平叛逆，不窝匪，不资敌，不给叛匪通风报信。对于叛乱分子，本军将本宽大政策，区别对待：凡脱离叛匪来归者，一概不咎既往；有立功表现者，给予奖励；对俘虏一律优待，不杀，不辱，不打，不搜腰包；对执迷不悟，坚决顽抗者，严惩不贷。本军纪律严明，维护群众利益，保护农牧工商各业，买卖公平，不拿群众一针一线，尊重群众宗教信仰和风俗习惯，保护喇嘛寺庙，保护文物古迹。望全体僧俗人民，一律安居乐业，切勿听信谣言，自相惊扰，切切此布！
