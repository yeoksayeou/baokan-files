Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th - The completely modernized Yangsimiao Port Area in Wuhan officially commenced construction on the 25th.

　　Yangsimiao Port Area is located at the head of Yingwuzhou in Hanyang. It will be built into a huge water-land transportation port. The port operation area covers nearly 400,000 square meters and has ten modern wharves, including two specialized coal wharves, four steel loading and unloading wharves, and four grain and general cargo wharves. All major loading and unloading operations will be carried out by mechanical and electrical means. A 16-kilometer-long railway will also be built within the port area, one end connecting to the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and the other extending directly to the riverbank. Goods from ships can be directly loaded and unloaded onto trains using gantry cranes. After the completion of this port, the annual cargo throughput capacity will reach more than 9.5 million tons, 1.96 times the current throughput of Wuhan Port, making it one of the largest and most mechanized inland river ports in China. This new port area is required to be basically completed this year and partially put into production.

　　Wuhan, traditionally known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces," is a transportation hub for water-land transportation in the inland of China. Before liberation, Wuhan had no systematic or decent port construction at all. The dilapidated wharves left over from old China, after a series of renovations after liberation, have seen their port passage capacity expand year by year. However, the old port cannot be further developed due to environmental limitations, and the throughput capacity cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of the national construction cause. This situation will be completely changed after the completion of the new Yangsimiao Port.

Shanghai
　　Xinhua News Agency - The largest modern water-land transportation wharf in Shanghai, Zhanghuabang, has recently started construction. It is a new port area opened to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.

　　The new port area is located on the west bank of the Huangpu River, with a superior terrain. It is a good deep-water port area. After completion, it can berth ocean-going giant ships of 10,000 to 30,000 tons with a draft of 11 meters. The newly built wharf structure is of a high-pile deep-beam, panel type. Except for the deep beams, all will use prestressed reinforced concrete components. Large-scale lifting equipment will be installed on the wharf, and special railway lines will be laid so that goods can be transported directly between ships and trains.

　　The entire port construction project, including wharves, storage yards, railways, and roads, is huge in scale. The first phase of the project, five wharf berths and their ancillary buildings, is planned to be completed within this year. The increased throughput capacity after the completion of this phase of the project will be equal to about one-sixth of the total throughput of Shanghai Port last year. Employees of the Shanghai Port Construction Engineering Bureau proposed: On the premise of ensuring quality, strive to build two berths by the end of April at the fastest speed. (Attached picture)

### 两大内河巨港开工

    两大内河巨港开工
    武汉
    新华社武汉28日电　设备完全现代化的武汉杨泗庙港区25日正式动工兴建。
    杨泗庙港区位于汉阳鹦鹉洲洲头，它将建设成为一个规模巨大的水陆联运港口。港口作业区的面积近四十万平方公尺，有十个近代化码头，其中有两个煤炭专业码头，四个钢铁装卸码头，四个粮食杂货码头。主要装卸作业，将全部采用机械、电气操作。港区内还将建筑十六公里长的铁路，一端同京广线相接，一端直伸到江边，船上的货物可以用龙门吊车直接起卸到火车上。这个港口建成之后，每年货物吞吐能力可达九百五十多万吨，为现在武汉港吞吐量的一点九六倍，是目前我国内河最大、机械化程度最高的港口之一。这个新港区要求在今年基本建成，并部分投入生产。
    向来被称为“九省通衢”的武汉，是我国内地水陆联运的交通枢纽。解放以前，武汉根本没有系统的、像样的港口建设。旧中国遗留下来的一些破烂码头，经过解放后一系列的改造工作，港口通过能力一年比一年扩大。但是旧港口因受环境的限制，不能得到更大的发展，吞吐能力不能适应国家建设事业高速发展的需要。杨泗庙新港建成以后，这一状况将得到彻底改变。
    上海
    据新华社讯　上海目前规模最大的现代化张华浜水陆联运码头最近开工兴建。它是为适应工农业大跃进的需要而开辟的新港区。
    新港区处于黄浦江西岸，地势优越，是一个良好的深水港区，落成以后可停靠一万到三万吨级、吃水十一公尺的海洋巨轮。新建码头结构为高桩深梁、面板型式，除深梁外，将全部采用预应力钢筋混凝土构件。码头上将安装大型起重设备，铺设铁路专线，轮船、火车间可直接运载货物。
    整个建港工程包括码头、库场、铁路、道路等，规模巨大。第一期工程五个码头泊位及其附属建筑，计划在今年年内完工，这期工程完成以后所增加的吞吐能力，将等于去年上海全港吞吐量的六分之一左右。上海市筑港工程局职工提出：要在保证质量的前提下，力争以最快速度在4月底建成两个泊位。（附图片）
