Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 26th -- The workers fighting on China's largest blast furnace, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Blast Furnace, completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule on the 25th, based on fulfilling their plans by the ten-day period and by month.

    This giant blast furnace, equipped with a high-pressure furnace top and automatic control equipment, was built and put into production in November last year. Since the beginning of the new year, the workers in charge of this blast furnace have vigorously carried out a technical innovation movement centered on improving production technology, which has steadily increased the daily production level of the blast furnace. The average daily pig iron production was 1,820 tons in January, 2,039 tons in February, and an average of 2,129 tons in the first twenty-five days of March. Currently, the workers are advancing victoriously, striving to increase production by another 13,000 tons of high-quality pig iron by the end of the month.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th -- The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company completed the first quarter's production plans for pig iron and steel ahead of schedule on the 25th.

    In these three months, the production levels of pig iron and steel at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have risen month by month. Compared with the first quarter of last year, pig iron production increased by 32%, and steel production increased by 28%.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 26th -- A newly built modern giant coking oven at Anshan Iron and Steel, the No. 4 Coke Oven, has been completed and ignited for drying on the afternoon of the 25th. Workers are striving to officially produce the first batch of metallurgical coke before the "May 1st" holiday. This 65-hole modern coking oven is one of the largest coking ovens in China today. After it is put into production, it can produce 450,000 tons of metallurgical coke annually and recover more than 200 million cubic meters of coal gas, which are essential "supplies" for steel production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th -- The Changchun Rolling Stock Plant, which is under construction, is implementing the principle of combining construction and production, and has begun delivering cars one and a half years ahead of schedule. The first X60 new type freight car was manufactured on the 25th. The carrying capacity of this freight car is ten tons more than the X50 type freight car currently running on China's railways, the effective volume is increased by eleven cubic meters, the dead weight is reduced by 2.1 tons, and the steel used is about 10% less than the X50 type freight car.

    The Changchun Rolling Stock Plant officially started construction in July 1957. According to the original plan, it should have been put into production in the third quarter of 1960. This year, in order to meet the needs of railway transportation, the factory decided to carry out production simultaneously during construction and determined to produce 800 freight cars for the country within the year.

    工业战线一天四喜临门
    鞍钢十号高炉和太钢完成首季生铁生产计划
    鞍钢新焦炉点火烘炉，长春车辆厂提前出车
    据新华社鞍山26日电　战斗在我国目前最大的高炉——鞍钢十号高炉上的全体职工，在按旬按月完成计划的基础上，已经提前在25日完成第一季度生产计划。
    这座装备着高压炉顶和自动控制设备的巨型高炉，是去年11月建成并投入生产的。掌握这座高炉的职工们进入新年以来，围绕提高生产技术水平这一中心，大力开展了技术革新运动，使高炉的日产水平步步升高，1月份平均日产生铁一千八百二十吨，2月份提高到二千零三十九吨，3月份头二十五天平均达到二千一百二十九吨。目前职工们正在乘胜猛进，力争到月末再增产一万三千吨优质生铁。
    据新华社太原26日电　太原钢铁公司职工提前在25日完成了第一季度生铁和钢材生产计划。
    这三个月内，太原钢铁公司的生铁和钢材的生产水平逐月上升；同去年第一季度比较，生铁产量增长32％，钢材产量增长28％。
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢一座新建的现代化的巨型炼焦炉——四号焦炉已经建成，并在25日下午点火烘炉。职工们正争取在“五一”节以前正式生产出第一批冶金焦炭。这座六十五孔的现代化炼焦炉，是目前我国最大的炼焦炉之一。它投入生产后，每年可以生产冶金焦炭四十五万吨，回收煤气两亿多立方公尺，这些都是钢铁生产必需的“粮草”。
    据新华社长春26日电　兴建中的长春车辆厂，实行边建设、边生产的方针，提前一年半开始出车。第一辆×六○新型货车已在25日制成。这种货车的载重能力比我国目前铁路上运行的×五○型货车多十吨，有效容积增加十一立方公尺，自重却降低了二点一吨，所用的钢材也比×五○型货车减少约10％。
    长春车辆厂是1957年7月正式动工兴建的。按原订计划，应在1960年第三季度投入生产。今年，工厂为了适应铁路运输需要，决定在建设期间同时进行生产，并确定在年内为国家生产八百辆货车。
