To Be Masters of Nature
Yu Dejiang, First Secretary of the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China

    1958 was a year of brilliant victory for the Yulin Prefecture on the production front. In that year, under the leadership of the Party, the 1.5 million people of Yulin Prefecture waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against nature, achieving great accomplishments in agricultural construction. In 1958, water conservancy projects were completed for 1.17 million mu, equivalent to more than double the total of 500,000 mu of all water-irrigated land in Yulin Prefecture before 1958. Massive soil and water conservation projects were carried out, controlling soil erosion over an area of 12,047 square kilometers. Afforestation efforts greened 5.24 million mu of desert, equivalent to three times the area greened after the liberation of the entire region. These great achievements in farmland construction led to an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain in 1958, with total output soaring from 460 million jin in 1957 to 1.15 billion jin, an increase of about one and a half times. This transformed the Yulin area from a grain-deficient region to a grain-surplus region. This victory is a victory for the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism.

    In this year, within the Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of people in the Yulin area, based on the Party's theory of dialectical materialism and in light of the actual conditions in the Yulin area, we focused on resolving how people can correctly understand the laws of nature and, according to these laws, give play to their subjective initiative to dominate and transform nature, overcome unfavorable natural conditions, and utilize favorable natural conditions to build Yulin into a prosperous and happy region. Without first resolving this key issue, it would be impossible to break down people's superstitions about nature and maximize the liberation of thought. It must be acknowledged that the natural conditions in the Yulin area are relatively harsh. The northern areas along the inner and outer Great Wall, including Dingbian, Jingbian, Yulin, and Shenmu, are wind and sand regions, with desert areas accounting for about one-third of the total area of the region. Before liberation, there was a folk song that said: "The wind blows yellow sand so you can hardly open your eyes, crop seedlings can't grow fully, houses are buried by sand and people move away, the evil yellow sand brings bitter suffering." The counties along the banks of the Wuding River in the north and south are also areas of serious soil erosion, with ravines and gullies crisscrossing the land and the soil being barren. The region receives little rainfall, with a saying that it experiences "nine droughts in ten years." The climate is relatively cold, with early frosts and freezing in the autumn, often causing frost damage to late autumn crops. Before 1958, grain yields were only 40 to 50 jin per mu. However, we believe that people are the most active factor in the struggle for production, and that people are capable of understanding and transforming nature. Based on this understanding, we actively launched publicity and education campaigns among the masses, calling on everyone to break down superstitions, liberate their minds, and establish the idea of being masters of nature. The Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China first analyzed the natural conditions of the Yulin area, pointing out that while the Yulin area has deserts and grasslands and experiences nine droughts in ten years, it also has vast land, abundant resources, and many rivers, which can be used to develop water conservancy and overcome drought. We should: first, not view difficult conditions in isolation or one-sidedly, but also see the favorable conditions and be good at using favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable conditions; second, not regard difficult conditions as absolute, as unfavorable conditions can be transformed into favorable conditions under certain conditions, and difficult conditions themselves contain factors that promote their transformation into favorable conditions; third, special emphasis should be placed on the human factor, on the subjective initiative of people. With the correct leadership of the Party and the improved consciousness of the broad masses, people have the ability to overcome any natural difficulties.

    The Prefectural Committee also analyzed factory history data: in the past, only a little over 100 million jin of grain were transferred in from other places each year, which means that as long as grain production increased by 100 million jin, basic self-sufficiency could be achieved. What is 100 million jin of grain to the Communists? If even 100 million jin of grain cannot be increased, what kind of Great Leap Forward is that? As long as we exert even greater effort than we did when fighting Hu Zongnan, and grain production is doubled or tripled, won't the problem of grain shortage be easily solved? With this as the central topic, combined with the later stage of the rectification campaign in the countryside, we launched a mass debate among cadres and the masses throughout the region, especially debating the questions: "Can the harsh natural conditions be changed? Can people be masters of nature? Can the people of the region achieve grain self-sufficiency and surplus through one year of hard work?" The results of the debate enabled the broad masses to correctly understand natural conditions and the subjective initiative of people. This debate became a relatively profound Marxist education.

    However, educating the people and encouraging them to fight against nature with greater enthusiasm requires not only solving ideological and cognitive problems theoretically, but more importantly, summarizing how to specifically understand natural conditions and create experience in achieving high yields from production practices. While launching the mass debate, the Prefectural Committee spent a great deal of effort organizing a large number of cadres to summarize more than 150 experiences in increasing production in the mountains, plains, rivers, and wind-sand areas of the Yulin area, compiling them into two volumes of the "Compilation of Agricultural Production Increase Experiences in Yulin Prefecture," totaling about 400,000 words, and distributing more than 20,000 copies as living teaching materials for educating cadres at all levels and the masses in understanding and transforming nature. These experiences reiterated that as long as people correctly understand the laws of nature and utilize favorable natural conditions to overcome unfavorable natural conditions, they will definitely be able to obtain high yields and create miracles. Surrounded by yellow sand, Yulin's Huayuangou, which has relatively harsh natural conditions, has accumulated relatively complete experiences in transforming nature, such as preventing sand and afforestation, realizing the gardening of cultivated land, and intensive cultivation, as a result of years of recognizing nature and fighting against nature. They have overcome the unfavorable conditions of sandstorms, developed the favorable conditions of water conservancy facilities and deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Although the soil here is sandy, the yield per mu has still reached thousands of jin for years, becoming a red flag in the Yulin area. These typical experiences were quickly disseminated and promoted through various meetings held in various places, allowing people to further uncover the secrets of nature and embark on a path from low yield to high yield. This was another more concrete education combining theory with practice.

    The above-mentioned region-wide, profound, and vivid ideological education movement that combines theory with practice to change the natural landscape has become a guide for mobilizing 1.5 million people. Driven by this guide, the broad masses of people throughout the region actively responded to the Party's call and acted with great enthusiasm. Various thousand-person and ten-thousand-person mobilization rallies to advance on nature were held, forming an unstoppable torrent of conquering nature. People braved the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, overturned frozen soil, and lifted ice layers to advance toward water conservancy; this was unprecedented in the history of the Yulin area. The people, whose minds have been liberated, are creating historical miracles in this way.

    Countless facts prove that to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize our minds. Transforming nature first requires people to have the idea of overcoming nature. The liberation of people's minds and the changes in the spiritual world promote the changes in the material world, and in turn promote the liberation of people's minds. Transforming nature and transforming thinking are mutually influencing each other. Last year, because we followed the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that "political and ideological work is the commander of all work," we first won the battle in ideological work, thereby guaranteeing the great harvest in agriculture.

    Although we achieved a great harvest in grain in 1958, we are still behind the advanced areas, and there is still a considerable distance to go before we can completely solve the grain problem. Therefore, this can only be regarded as the starting point of victory, just taking the first step in a greater leap forward. We must continue to implement the mass line, advocate the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, advocate a pragmatic and down-to-earth work style, and ensure that agricultural production in 1959 will have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    要做大自然的主人
    中共榆林地委第一书记　鱼得江
    1958年是榆林专区在生产战线上取得辉煌胜利的一年。在这一年里，榆林专区一百五十万人民，在党的领导下，向大自然进行了英勇顽强的斗争，在农业建设方面取得了很大成就。1958年完成水利一百一十七万亩，相等于榆林专区1958年前所有水地总和五十万亩的二倍多；进行了巨大的水土保持工程，控制水土流失面积达一万二千零四十七平方公里；植树造林绿化沙漠五百二十四万亩，相等于全区解放以后绿化面积的三倍。这一切农田建设的巨大成就，促使1958年的粮食获得空前大丰收，由1957年总产四亿六千万斤猛增至十一亿五千万斤，增产一倍半左右。这就使榆林地区由缺粮区变成了余粮区。这个胜利是党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的胜利。
    在这一年中，我们在榆林地区各级党组织和广大人民群众中，根据党的辩证唯物主义的理论，结合榆林地区的实际情况，着重解决了人如何正确认识自然规律，并且按照自然规律发挥主观能动作用，来主宰自然，改造自然，克服不利的自然条件，利用有利的自然条件，把榆林建设成为一个繁荣幸福的地区。不首先解决这个关键性的问题，便不能破除人们对自然的迷信，便不能最大限度地解放思想。应该承认，榆林地区的自然条件是比较恶劣的。北部沿长城内外的定边、靖边、榆林、神木系风沙地区，沙漠面积约占全区总面积的三分之一。解放前有一首民谣唱道：“风刮黄沙难睁眼，庄稼苗苗出不全，房被沙压人移走，万恶的黄沙害人苦。”南北沿无定河两岸的各县又是严重的水土流失地区，境内沟壑纵横，土地瘠薄。全区雨量稀少，有
  “十年九旱”之说。气候比较寒冷，秋季来霜早、结冻早，晚秋作物常遭冻灾。在1958年以前，粮食亩产只有四、五十斤。但是，我们认为人是生产斗争中最活跃的因素，人是能够认识自然，改造自然的。根据这一认识，我们积极地在群众中展开宣传教育活动，号召大家破除迷信，解放思想，树立作大自然主人的思想。中共榆林地委首先分析了榆林地区的自然条件，指出榆林地区虽有沙漠草地，十年九旱的一面，但同时又有土地辽阔，资源丰富，河流很多，能够大办水利战胜干旱的有利的一面。我们应该：第一、不要孤立地、片面地去看待困难的条件，同时要看到有利的条件，并且要善于利用有利条件去克服不利条件。第二、不要把困难条件看成是绝对的，在一定的条件下，不利条件也可以转化成有利条件，困难条件本身就包含着促使它向有利条件转化的因素。第三、应该特别重视人的因素，重视人的主观能动性。有了党的正确领导，有了广大群众觉悟提高的条件，人们有能力战胜任何自然困难。
    地委同时分析了厂史资料：过去从外地每年只不过调进一亿多斤粮食，也就是说只要增产一亿斤粮食，就可以基本自给。一亿斤粮食放在共产党人的面前又算什么呢？如果连一亿斤粮食都增产不下，那又算是什么跃进呢？只要拿出比打胡宗南更大的干劲，粮食翻上一、两番，缺粮问题不是能够迎刃而解吗？我们以此为中心题目，结合农村后期全民整风，在全区干部和群众中开展了一次全民性的大鸣大放大辩论，特别辩论了：“恶劣的自然条件能不能改变？人能不能作自然的主人？全区人民能不能苦战一年达到粮食自给和有余？”辩论结果，使广大人民群众正确地认识了自然条件以及人的主观能动作用。这次辩论成为比较深刻的一次马克思主义教育。
    但是教育人民群众鼓起更大的干劲向自然进行斗争，不仅需要从理论上解决思想认识问题，更重要的必须从生产实践中总结如何具体地认识自然条件，创造丰产经验的问题。地委在开展群众性的大辩论的同时，花了很大力量，组织大批干部总结了榆林地区山、川、水、风沙地区各方面的一百五十多项增产经验，编成约四十万字的“榆林专区农业增产经验汇编”上下两册，共发行两万多册，作为教育各级干部和人民群众认识自然改造自然的活教材。这些经验再次指出，只要人们正确的认识自然规律，并且去利用有利的自然条件，克服不利的自然条件，就一定可以获得高额丰产，就一定可以创造奇迹。四面被黄沙包围自然条件比较恶劣的榆林花园沟，由于人民群众多年来认识自然和向自然斗争的结果，积累了比较完整的防沙造林、实现耕地园田化、精耕细作等改造自然的经验，他们克服了风沙灾害的不利条件，发展了水利设施和深耕细作的有利条件，虽然这里是沙质土壤，而连年亩产仍然获得了千斤，为榆林地区的一面红旗。通过各地召开各种会议，迅速传播和推广了这些典型经验，使人们进一步地揭开了大自然的秘密，踏开了一条由低产变高产的道路。这又是一次更为具体的理论结合实际的教育。
    上述全区性的改变自然面貌的深刻生动的理论结合实际的思想教育运动，成为动员一百五十万人民的一条纲。由这一条纲的带动，全区广大人民群众积极响应党的号召，鼓足干劲地行动起来了。纷纷召开了各种向自然进军的千人、万人誓师大会，形成了一股势不可当的征服大自然的巨流，人们冒着零下二十多度的严寒，掀开冻土，揭起冰层，向水利化进军；这是榆林地区历史上所不曾有过的。解放了思想的人民群众，就是这样英勇地创造着历史奇迹。
    无数事实证明：要革自然的命首先要革思想的命。改造自然首先要求靠人们具有战胜自然的思想。人的思想解放，精神世界的改变，推动着物质世界的改变，反过来又推动着人们思想的解放。改造自然和改造思想，这是互相影响着的。去年由于我们遵照党中央和毛主席提出的“政治思想工作是一切工作的统帅”的教导，因而首先在思想工作中打了胜仗，从而保证了农业的大丰收。
    1958年我们虽然取得了粮食大丰收，但比起先进地区还差一些，距离彻底解决粮食问题，也还有着一段不小的距离。因此，这只能看作是胜利的起点，只是迈开了更大跃进的第一步。我们必须继续贯彻群众路线，提倡苦干、实干和巧干的精神，提倡实事求是、踏踏实实的工作作风，保证1959年农业生产有一个更大更好更全面的大跃进。
