    A Laudable Attitude Towards Labor

    Sufficient material preparation and an ever-increasing mass awareness are the foundations for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. With the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, people's enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher, and production work is becoming more and more meticulous. It can be asserted that this year's agricultural production will definitely have a greater development than last year. However, there are still some difficulties in the progress, the most important of which is the shortage of labor.

    How to solve the problem of labor shortage? The news articles we published today provide powerful solutions to this problem and are worthy of attention.

    Guangdong Province plans to comprehensively and rationally adjust labor organization and improve production technology, centering on tool reform, to achieve a doubling of labor productivity. In Hengshan Nanyue Commune in Hunan, through tool reform, not only was the labor shortage of more than one million people made up, but there was also a surplus. Li Tianzhu in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, worked diligently and cleverly, doing more than six hundred workdays in the past year, with one person doing the work of two; now the county is carrying out a "everyone learn from Li Tianzhu, everyone do more workdays" movement. All of these are powerful measures to improve labor productivity and solve the problem of labor shortage.

    What is particularly commendable here is Li Tianzhu's style of loving the community like his home and his conscious attitude of being the master, which is the most fundamental condition for developing production and overcoming difficulties. People are the most active factor in production. All production tools must be created by people, and all labor organizations and systems must also be established and improved by people. Therefore, as long as people's subjective initiative is fully utilized, anything can be done well and any difficulty can be overcome.

    We believe that under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of mass movements, Li Tianzhu-like figures will universally appear in the Great Leap Forward movement in various regions.

    可贵的劳动态度
    充分的物质准备以及日益高涨的群众觉悟，是实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的基础。有了去年大跃进的经验，人们的生产劲头越来越高，生产工作也越做越细，可以断定，今年的农业生产必将比去年有更大的发展。但是，在前进中也还存在着一些困难，最主要的是劳动力不足。
    怎样解决劳力不足的问题呢？今天我们发表的几篇新闻，对解决这个问题提供了有力的办法，值得重视。
    广东省计划以工具改革为中心，全面合理地调整劳动组织，改进生产技术等，达到提高劳动生产率一倍。湖南衡山南岳公社通过工具改革，不仅补足了一百多万个劳力的缺额，反而有余。山西壶关县李天柱勤勤恳恳，实干巧干，去年一年做了六百多个劳动日，一人做活顶两个人；现在全县正开展着“人人学习李天柱，个个多做劳动日”运动。所有这些，都是提高劳动生产率和解决劳力不足的有力措施。
    这里特别值得表扬的，是李天柱爱社如家的风格和主人翁的自觉的劳动态度，这是发展生产、战胜困难的最根本的条件。人是生产中最活动的因素，一切生产工具要人来创造，一切劳动组织和制度也要人来建立和改进，因此只要充分发挥了人的主观能动作用，什么事情都能办好，什么困难也可以克服。
    我们相信，在党的领导下，在群众运动的基础上，李天柱式的人物将在各地大跃进的运动中普遍出现。
