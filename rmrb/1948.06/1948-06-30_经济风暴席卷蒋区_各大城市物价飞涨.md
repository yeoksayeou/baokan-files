Xinhua News Agency, North China, 28th -- The June economic storm in the Jiang area, which began in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, has rapidly swept through other major cities under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Prices in Tianjin, Beiping, Taiyuan, Jinan, and other places have risen sharply as a result. According to belated reports from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao and the Min Kuo Jih Pao: In Tianjin, the "Battleship Brand" flour was still 4.1 million yuan per bag (40 catties, Jiang currency – same below) in the morning of the 8th, but rose to 4.2 million yuan in the afternoon, and further to 4.7 million yuan on the 11th. Rice was 98,000 yuan per catty on the 8th, but rose to 115,000 yuan on the 11th. Millet was 68,000 yuan per catty on the 6th, but had risen to 80,000 yuan by the 11th. Pork was 250,000 yuan per catty on the 6th, but the price on the 8th had risen to between 280,000 and 320,000 yuan. At the same time, prices in Beiping also tended to rise wildly. On the 10th, millet sold for 80,000 yuan per catty, rice for 120,000 yuan per catty, and pork for 310,000 yuan per catty. "Cantonese zongzi" were selling for as much as 100,000 yuan apiece. Amidst the soaring prices in Taiyuan, pork was actually selling for 700,000 yuan per catty on the 10th, mutton for 400,000 yuan per catty, and various vegetables had doubled in price. According to "North China News": Prices in Jinan began to rise sharply on the 6th. On that day, wheat rose from 23,500 yuan per catty in early May to 44,000 yuan, millet rose from 21,000 yuan to 38,000 yuan, and the price of first-class flour rose by 550,000 yuan per bag. The entire city suddenly fell into a state of terror, and citizens felt that they could not maintain their livelihoods.
