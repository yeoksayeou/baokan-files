　　With the merger of the *Jin-Cha-Ji Daily* of the Jin-Cha-Ji District and the *People's Daily* of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu District into this newspaper, we hope that all the correspondents of the original two newspapers will continue to serve as correspondents for this newspaper. With the spirit of loving and caring about the Party newspaper, please continuously contribute articles to this newspaper and provide suggestions for revision at any time. We hope that all actual workers, writing enthusiasts, and comrades who support this newspaper in various departments of the Party, government, military, and people throughout the region can regularly contribute articles to this newspaper, provide information, raise questions, send in various materials, or tell us about interview leads. Please pay attention to organizing reports on the questions and opinions raised by the masses in various places regarding work and policies, and if the masses request someone to write on their behalf, please be enthusiastic in undertaking this task.

　　Regarding the current reporting guidelines, please conduct reporting based on the points indicated in the inaugural editorial (serving as the inaugural speech) of this newspaper. Among them, the reporting on unity in production is the focus of the current reporting task. Please focus on reflecting the recovery and development of agricultural production, the production mood of people from all strata (including rich peasants, enlightened gentry, and landlords who have been distributed land and are willing to engage in production), how various places are entering production and organizing mutual aid and labor exchange? Introduce experiences in promoting production and mutual aid labor exchange; please also vigorously organize reports on industrial production and urban industry and commerce. The recovery and development of industry and handicrafts in various places, the actual situation of labor-capital cooperation and increased production after various factories implement new management and operation methods can all be selected as key points for specific reporting. In addition, regarding the experience of Party rectification and democracy, focus on systematic and complete typical materials; guerrilla warfare in border areas (the ongoing struggle against the enemy, such as protecting wheat and ensuring grain), please provide regular and continuous reporting.
