　　The Annihilation of Chiang Bandit's 86th Regiment
    Ding Yi, Zhen Quan
    At dawn on June 3rd, our troops of the Jilu Yu Military Region once again captured the fleeing Chiang bandit's 86th Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the 55th Division. Our company rushed into Lizhuang (under the jurisdiction of Linze) and eliminated more than 40 members of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's Puyang County home return corps. Immediately following, the commanders and fighters of our 52nd Battalion bravely charged the Chiang bandit's 86th Regiment in Duzhuang several times, enabling friendly units to quickly deploy and tightly encircle Duzhuang. The soldiers excitedly said, "Great, this time they can't escape!"
    On the afternoon of the 1st, after hearing that the powerful People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yellow River, the Chiang bandit's 86th Regiment abandoned Juancheng and fled in disarray to Tianzhuang, Xiniulou and other villages in the defense area of the enemy's 87th Regiment, while the 87th Regiment and the 29th Brigade headquarters fled towards Heze City. At dawn on the 2nd, our army attacked the Tianzhuang-Niulou line. The Chiang 29th Brigade's transport battalion entrenched in Renshawo laid down its arms under our strong military pressure. The panicked 86th Regiment, like birds startled by the twang of a bow, engaged in a burst of blind firing, and then fled north at noon, scurrying to Zhengying, then turning southeast, passing through Yanshi Kou (fifth district of Yunju County), where it was intercepted by our Linze district team. They were thrown into a chaotic mess, sometimes fleeing east, and sometimes fleeing southwest. After running for most of the night, they only traveled eighteen li, and when they reached Duzhuang, all the officers and soldiers were exhausted and thirsty, and had no choice but to temporarily settle down, rummaging through boxes and cabinets everywhere, catching chickens and slaughtering sheep, and looting all the people's food. As they were just laying down their tired bodies, the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire rang out. Hou Qingyun, the commander of the Chiang bandit's 86th Regiment, knew that he had been surrounded, so he ordered his subordinates to build fortifications, attempting to hold firm. He also sent a telegram to Huang Fangjun, the brigade commander trapped in Heze, desperately asking for help.
    At 11:00 a.m., two enemy regiments from Heze came to the rescue, but were fiercely attacked by our ambushing troops as soon as they approached Houji, and the enemy retreated in a panic. Huang Fangjun was at a loss and telegraphed back, "Your department should break through on its own, there is no other good plan." Hou Qingyun, who was already in a desperate situation, was extremely panicked. He immediately sent another telegram to his brigade commander: "I cannot break through, a breakthrough will lead to total annihilation."
    At 6:30 p.m., our army began its general attack. The 52nd and 54th Battalions, under the cover of intense artillery fire, successively broke into the village. The 7th Company of our 54th Battalion fought with incredible speed and ferocity, running the approximately one li from the starting point to Diao Zhai in one breath, and quickly constructing simple fortifications. Within two minutes, they completed all the actions of approaching the village edge, climbing ladders to cross walls, and opening up the field army's roads. A fierce charge unfolded, and the enemy only resisted in a panic. All kinds of artillery fire rang out in a burst, and the entire Duzhuang was shrouded in thick smoke. All the Chiang bandit's counterattacks were smashed, and the Chiang army's fortifications were occupied one by one by us, and entire groups of officers and soldiers were captured. Within two and a half hours, the enemy's 86th Regiment was completely annihilated. This was the third time the regiment had been completely annihilated, the first being in the Longhai Campaign in August 1946, and the second being in the Yuncheng Campaign in July 1947, along with the Chiang bandit's 55th Division, 29th Brigade.

　　蒋匪八六团的覆灭
    丁一　振全
    六月三日拂晓，我冀鲁豫军区部队又一把抓住了逃窜的蒋匪五五师廿九旅八六团。我某连一举冲进李庄（临泽属），把蒋记濮县还乡团四十多人解决。紧接着我五十二大队的指战员们，英勇的向杜庄蒋八六团冲锋数次，使友邻部队迅速展开，把杜庄层层紧密包围。战士们都兴奋的说：“好哇，这一次可跑不了他啦！”
    蒋匪八十六团在一日午后，听说强大的人民解放军已渡过黄河，就丢弃鄄城狼狈逃窜至敌八七团防地田庄、西牛楼等村，而八七团和廿九旅旅部即逃向菏泽城。二日拂晓，我军向田庄牛楼一线攻击。盘据任沙窝的蒋二九旅辎重营在我强大军事压力下放下武器。慌乱的八六团如惊弓之鸟，进行一阵盲目的射击后，于正午时分向北逃去，窜至郑营折而向东南，行经盐市口（郓钜县五区），被我临泽区队阻击，乱成一团糟，忽而向东逃，忽而又向西南逃。跑了多半夜，只走出十八里路，走到杜庄时，全体官兵疲惫饥渴不堪，不得已暂时住下，到处翻箱倒柜，捉鸡宰羊，把老百姓的一切粮食都抢光了。当他们刚刚躺下疲惫的身体时，人民解放军的炮火就响了。蒋匪八六团团长侯庆云知道已被包围，于是一面命令部下修工事，企图固守；一面向困守荷泽的旅长黄芳俊打电报苦苦求援。
    上午十一时，菏泽敌两个团出援，刚进至侯集附近，即遭我预伏部队猛烈痛击，敌狼狈撤退。黄芳后束手无策，回电说：“你部即自行突围，别无良策”。已陷于绝境的侯庆云简直慌乱已极，他马上给他的旅长又拍一电报：“我不能突围，一突围即会全部被歼”。
    下午六点半钟，我军开始总攻，五十二、五十四两大队在强烈炮火掩护下，先后突入村内。我五十四大队七营战斗动作神猛，从出发地到钓砦约一里路，一气跑到，迅速的构筑了简单工事。二分钟内即完成了接近村沿，爬梯越墙，及打通野军道路的一切动作。激烈的冲锋展开了，敌人只慌乱抵抗，各种炮火响成一片，整个杜庄被浓烟笼罩着。蒋匪的一切反扑都被打垮，蒋军工事一个个的被我占领，整军官兵一群群的被俘虏。在两个半小时内，敌八六团全部覆灭。按该团在四六年八月陇海战役中第一次全部被歼，四七年七月郓城战役中随蒋匪五十五师二九旅全部被歼，这是第三次全部被歼。
