　　Peiping Students Conduct Public Opinion Poll
　　Ninety-five Percent Dissatisfied with U.S. Policy of Supporting Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: News from Peiping and Tianjin newspapers: The off-campus public opinion poll on U.S. policy towards Japan, jointly conducted by the Political Science Societies of Yenching University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University in Peiping, proves that the "lenient" policy towards Japan of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek government is not only unanimously opposed by patriotic students and the people, but also widely resented by a large number of civil servants and officers and soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek ruling apparatus. This survey began on May 29th and ended on June 4th. Within a week, 60 letters containing answers were received, with 187 participants (since one letter often contained answers from several people). Among them, Chiang government civil servants and Chiang army officers and soldiers each accounted for four-tenths of the total number of participants, while the cultural and educational circles and students accounted for two-tenths. The results of the answer statistics: Under the question "What is your opinion on the United States reviving Japan?", 179 people expressed "completely dissatisfied", accounting for more than 95% of the total number of participants. To the question "What do you think of the U.S. support of Japan to China?", 101 people thought it was "extremely harmful" and 84 people thought it was "unfavorable"; the total of 185 people, accounted for more than 99%. "Which country do you think will be the first to be invaded by Japan after its revival?" 181 people (99%) answered "China". "What do you think of the Chinese government's (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, same below) lenient policy towards Japan (referring to the imperial policy of assisting the United States in reviving the aggressive forces of Japan)?" 171 people thought it was "inappropriate," accounting for more than 91%. "What do you think of the Chinese government's policy towards Japan?" 137 people thought it was "completely listening to the United States," accounting for more than 73% of the total number of people.
    In addition, Peking University's Sand Beach area (i.e., the main location of Peking University) held a test vote on the Japan issue at the end of May, with 317 students participating. Voting results: In the question "Has Japanese imperialism been revived?", 301 people answered "yes". In the question "Who will suffer first after Japan's revival?", 304 people answered "China". In the question "Is China's (Chiang government's) policy towards Japan independent? Or does it follow the United States? Or does it vacillate?", 246 people answered "follows the United States", each accounting for 85% to 95% of the total number of participants.
