　　[Ji Lu Yu News] Women in the Third District of Neihuang, supported by the government, are highly motivated to engage in production for self-salvation. In two months, they have woven 5,000 bolts of cloth, earning a net profit of 700 shi of grain. The democratic government, in order to provide relief to 3,000 disaster victims, issued 4,400-odd cloth sales certificates. Shops purchase the finished products (white cloth) at high prices and sell raw materials (cotton) and grain at low prices. When the masses initially received the cloth sales certificates, they had many ideological concerns. They worried that they might not be able to weave the cloth after receiving the certificates, that the certificates might not be valid, and that the government might not pay or might underpay for the cloth. However, after the first 60 percent of the certificates were distributed, Yang Wantang's wife and Yang Tu's mother from Nianbao Village received two certificates and sold two bolts of cloth at the market. After deducting the cost, each bolt earned them a net profit of two dou of millet. After they returned to the village and publicized this, all the women in the village, even those who had not been spinning, started to spin. Women in all villages, seeing that selling a bolt of cloth at the market after receiving a certificate could earn them one and a half to two dou of grain, also competed to receive the certificates. The women in the Northwest sub-district are the most active. Li Chunqin's wife from Li Ciyuan Village, with a family of five, can spin half a jin of cotton every day and weave a bolt of cloth in ten days. Since receiving the loan, she has woven five bolts of white cloth, earning about one shi of grain. Out of 4,068 households, totaling 16,345 people, 2,650 households borrowed cloth certificates and wove 4,200 bolts of cloth, while those who did not borrow certificates produced 1,000 bolts of cloth. In total, the entire district can earn 700 shi of grain, solving the food shortage for many people.
