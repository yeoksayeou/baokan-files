Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Prague dispatch: JCP Chairman Gottwald was unanimously elected as the third President of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly on the morning of the 14th of this month. After the President was elected, Dr. John, Speaker of the National Assembly, congratulated the President, saying: "Our people have entrusted our destiny to you. The country and we who represent the country thank you and trust you. You are a wise leader, the most advanced citizen and warrior. We believe that under your leadership, our republic will be more prosperous and happy." The capital, Prague, fired a 21-gun salute to celebrate the election of the new President. Flags fluttered over the Presidential Palace, and the whole country rejoiced. The citizens of Prague flocked to Hradcany Palace to pay their respects to the new President and organized a grand parade in four columns. Mass meetings and demonstrations were held in urban and rural areas. On the evening of the 14th, the new President addressed tens of thousands of Prague residents, saying: "After the glorious days of February this year and the historically significant election of May 30, we now have all the necessary conditions to make the will of our people the final law. The composition and nature of the work of the new parliament, the new government, and all power organs are the expression of the will of the Czech nation. The old democracy, the false democracy, no longer exists. We have obtained true people's democracy at the cost of great sacrifice. Under our democratic system, industry belongs to the people, the land belongs to the peasants, and the people labor for their own benefit." Gottwald finally urged the country to concentrate all creative efforts to complete the construction of the People's Democratic Republic. Note: The Czech constitution grants the president great responsibilities and powers: the president is the head of state, the commander-in-chief of the national armed forces, has the power to appoint the government and accept its resignation, has the power to appoint and recall diplomatic envoys, senior government officials, university professors and judges, has the power to sign diplomatic treaties and to sign all laws passed by the National Assembly, and has the power to dissolve the National Assembly when necessary.
