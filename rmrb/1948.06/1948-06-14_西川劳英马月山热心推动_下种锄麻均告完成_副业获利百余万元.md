　　Heroic Laborer Ma Yueshan Enthusiastically Promotes:
  　Sowing and Weeding of Hemp Completed;
  　Over One Million Yuan Profit from Sideline Occupations

　　[Huguān News] The mutual aid team of labor hero Ma Yueshan in Xichuan Village, Third District of Huguan County, voluntarily combined three mutual aid groups. Under the early morning and late night promotion of labor hero Ma Yueshan, all sowing was completed by the 15th day of the fourth lunar month. The team's cooperative mutual aid society has 40 households and 370,000 yuan in shares. This spring, labor hero Ma Yueshan, on the principle of not hindering agricultural production, extracted three people from the team to drive six donkeys, and two people to carry loads for sideline occupations. After sowing, the preliminary agricultural and sideline production work was summarized, and the profits were very large. For example, transportation earned 800,000 yuan, selling mountain products earned 30,000 yuan, selling millet earned 350,000 yuan, and organizing women to spin cotton and supplying raw materials to sell finished products resulted in a total of 150 jin of cotton spun and 1,216 chi of cloth woven. After deducting costs, each chi was calculated at 200 yuan, earning a total of 208,800 yuan. Selling salt and noodles earned 12,460 yuan. In total, the cooperative earned 1,434,420 yuan by organizing surplus labor to engage in sideline occupations. Labor and capital dividends (labor 80%, capital 20%) satisfied everyone. The head of the cooperative, Ma Demao, is actively working to become a model cadre of a cooperative that serves all members of the community. Currently, half of the labor force is spreading seeds on slopes and weeding hemp. More than 20 mu of slopes have been planted, and the hemp has been weeded once across the board. The cooperative organized women to cut small needle leaves on the mountain to boil and dye black cloth. They dyed it first and then washed it with pond mud, dyeing a total of 227 chi of black cloth. Dyeing one chi is worth one work day, and each work day is worth four jin of millet, totaling 18,160 yuan. Four laborers were organized to drive eight animals to Linxian County for transportation twice, taking eight days for the round trip, earning 64,000 yuan. Three people carried loads to sell used clothing. In order to overcome the difficulty of burning coal during the summer harvest and rush-weeding period, more than 13,000 jin of coal have been transported back. The whole team, men and women, are all engaged in production, and no one is idle. Under the influence of the team, the entire village has a great enthusiasm for agricultural and sideline production.
