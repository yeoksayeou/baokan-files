　　Local County and District Governments Should Strictly Enforce Travel Permit Procedures
  　Do Not Randomly Approve Vehicle Requisitions
    Comrade Editor:
    I set off on April 26th for official business in Zhangnan, Wei County, and Daming, and along the way I saw and heard many things that were not in accordance with the joint order issued by the Border Region Government and Military Region, published in the People's Daily on April 20th, prohibiting the random requisitioning of transportation. From Huilong to Xincunji, a distance of less than fifty li, I saw nineteen family vehicles heading to the front lines. Most of these vehicles were approved by the districts, villages, and counties. According to comrades in the Wei County Civil Affairs Section, they transfer no fewer than five or six family vehicles passing back and forth every day, with a maximum of more than ten vehicles in one day. Regarding this serious waste of manpower, I request that governments at all levels and all vehicle-approving agencies refrain from randomly approving vehicles and strictly enforce travel permit procedures. Standing on the side of the soldiers, I ask family members to set an example in implementing government orders and not to cause trouble for the villages, districts, and counties or increase the burden on the masses when coming to the front lines. This is my subjective opinion. (Gao Junqing, 126th Regiment, 42nd Brigade, ×× Column)

　　各地县区政府应严格支差手续
  　不要乱批差车
    编辑同志：
    我四月二十六号出发到漳南、魏县、大名等地公干，沿途见到与听到不少不合四月二十日人民日报刊登的边府、军区联合命令的不准乱要差现象。由回隆至辛村集不到五十里路，就见有十九辆家属车到前方去，这些车大部分是由区村县批准的。据魏县民政科同志谈，每天转送来往家属的车，总不下五、六辆，最多一天出过十几辆。对这种严重浪费民力现象，我要求各级政府及各个批车机关，最好不要乱批车，严格支差手续。我站在子弟方面，要求家属作执行政府命令的模范，到前方来不要给村区县增加麻烦、增加群众负担。这是我的主观意见。（××纵队四十二旅一二六团高俊卿）
