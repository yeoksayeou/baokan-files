　　[Jinan News] During the major re-examination in the Yongzhi Fifth District last year, a large amount of grain, cotton, cash, farm tools, and furniture were seized during struggle sessions. This hurt many middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants were often driven out of their homes. Since April, the district has concentrated its efforts on three major tasks: satisfying poor peasants (by sharing the spoils), compensating middle peasants for their losses, and properly resettling landlords and rich peasants. When sharing the spoils, a conference of middle and poor peasants was convened to clarify the extent of the "pits" created by excessive struggle and to fill them in. According to statistics from twenty-one villages, 1,946 households received a total of 254,600 catties of grain, 117,300 catties of cotton, and 7,264,000 yuan. At the same time, education was conducted to promote unity between middle and poor peasants, enlightening poor peasants to consciously correct their narrow economic views and supporting correct opinions among poor peasants. For example, some poor peasants said, "We can't just be jealous of middle peasants because they have more things. Dong Xiao's mother from Zhaoquan village started as a beggar but bought nineteen mu of land, and she was struggled against, but no one in the village was happy about it!" Then, the losses of middle peasants were compensated. In twenty villages, sixty-six households of middle peasants who had been subjected to struggle had a total of 15,200 catties of grain, 4,391 catties of cotton, 24 head of livestock (half of which were compensated at a price because they had been sold), 500 catties of sesame cakes, 13 purlins, over 400 pieces of wooden furniture, 34 farm tools, and over 200 pieces of clothing returned to them. Apologies were made to the middle peasants, and the label of "struggled household" was removed. Appropriate arrangements were also made for the landlords and rich peasants who had been driven out of their homes. According to statistics from fifteen villages, 101 households of landlords and rich peasants were given 18,167 catties of grain and 700 catties of cotton. During the above work, it was repeatedly explained that the only way to become rich was to rely on one's own hard work in production. Poor peasants were educated not to waste any of the spoils they received but to use them all for production. The poor peasants in Li Guanying, Yang Xinzhuang, and He Mazhuang villages bought twenty-eight cattle and five donkeys, and the purchase of fertilizer was even more widespread. Middle peasants also began to focus on production with peace of mind. After landlords and rich peasants obtained living and production materials, they also began to work hard to produce.

　　永智五区认真填补安置
  　各阶层安心生产
    【冀南消息】永智五区去年大复查时，斗出大批粮食、棉花、现款、农具、家具等，伤害的中农不少，地主富农多是扫地出门。四月份以来，该区集中全力进行满足贫农（借分果实）、退补中农损失、安置地主富农三大工作。借分果实时，召开中贫农大会，分清坑大小，进行填坑。据二十一个村统计：一千九百四十六户，共分粮二十五万四千六百斤，棉十一万七千三百斤，款七百二十六万四千元；同时进行中贫农是一家的教育，启发贫农自觉纠正狭隘的经济观点，扶持贫农中正确意见，如有的贫农说：“不能光看中农东西多点就眼红，赵圈董小他娘要饭出身，买了十九亩地，也被斗了，全村没有一个人满意！”然后退补中农损失，二十个村被斗中农六十六户，共退还粮一万五千二百斤、棉四千三百九十一斤、牲口廿四头（有十头半因为卖了，作价补偿）、麻饼五百斤、檩子十三根、木器家具四百多件、农具三十四件、衣服二百多件，并向中农认错，摘掉“被斗户”的帽子。对扫地出门的地主富农也作了适当安置，据十五个村统计：一百零一户地主富农，发给一万八千一百六十七斤粮食，七百斤棉花。进行以上工作时，反复说明要想发家致富，只有靠自己好好生产，教育贫农把分得的果实一点也不要浪费，全部用于生产上去。李官营、杨辛庄、何马庄三村贫农就买了二十八头牛，五头驴，买肥料的更普遍。中农也开始安心生产；地主富农获得生活生产资料后，亦开始努力生产。
