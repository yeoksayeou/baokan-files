【Taihang News】 Shexian and Huguan held doctors' meetings to relieve ideological concerns and launch a summer disease prevention campaign. On May 29th, the Sixth District of Shexian County held a meeting of all medical personnel in the district. Sixteen doctors attended the meeting. After discussion and deliberation, it was found that doctors had three ideological problems: (1) Doctors from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds felt that despite working hard to treat the masses, they were still looked down upon. If the illness was not cured, people would blame the doctor. This made doctors afraid to treat the masses boldly, fearing accusations of political problems. Doctor Fu Mianzhi said: "When treating the masses, because of my bad background, I was afraid of being labeled, so I was always hesitant and not bold. Even if I could treat some diseases, I would deliberately refuse to do so." (2) When going to other villages to treat the masses, it might be their turn to perform corvee labor. If they didn't go, they were afraid the masses would say they were putting on airs. If they went, the village would have to find someone to replace them and provide replacement grain. Doctor Liu Zhentang said: "Last year during the busy farming season, I went to other villages to treat the masses, which delayed production and cost more than 200 catties of replacement grain." (3) They felt that being a doctor had no status in the village. Treating the masses didn't even guarantee enough food, which resulted in wasted work throughout the year and complaints from their families. Then, District Chief Liu spoke, first explaining that district and village cadres had previously held "leftist" ideas, looked down on medical personnel, and suspected that all doctors were spies. They also failed to consider the actual difficulties of the doctors. Secondly, the following three problems raised by the doctors were resolved: 1. All doctors, as long as they sincerely treat the masses, will be guaranteed by the government and issued medical practice licenses. Past wrong struggles or incorrect class designations will be corrected, and confiscated medicines will be guaranteed to be returned. 2. When treating the masses, if it is their turn to perform corvee labor, they will be exempt from it. If production is delayed, the village will find ways to help with farming. 3. When treating illnesses, as long as the masses voluntarily offer gifts to the doctor, the government will not restrict it. After the doctors' ideological problems were resolved, they exchanged medical experiences in groups and formulated future treatment plans: (1) Doctors at each base point will work in groups to be responsible for treating all patients at that base point. (2) If there are more patients and fewer doctors at a particular base point, the Sixth District Cooperative will be responsible for adjusting and allocating resources. (3) Doctors at each base point will report the situation to the medical director of the district cooperative every week. (4) All doctors in the district will meet once every half month to summarize medical work, exchange experiences, and improve doctors' skills. Doctors in the Second and Sixth Districts of Huguan also held district-wide doctors' meetings one after another, reviewing past shortcomings and formulating district-wide disease prevention and treatment plans. Doctors in the Sixth District were divided into seven groups according to region, and each group was responsible for treatment in their designated area under the leadership of a group leader. It was decided to hold two large meetings every half month to exchange treatment experiences and research many simple disease prevention methods at the meetings. In addition to general treatment, doctors in the Second District specially organized many temple fair discount treatment centers, which achieved great results. At the March 15th conference in Haolao Village, the medical center treated a total of 134 people and 19 livestock.

　　解除医生思想顾虑
  　涉县展开防疫运动
    【太行消息】涉县、壶关召开医生会议，解除思想顾虑，展开夏季防疫运动。涉县六区于五月二十九日，召开全区医务人员会议。到会医生十六人，经大家酝酿圪扯，发现医生在思想上存在三个问题：（一）地主富农出身的医生感到自己风里来雨里去，给群众看病，结果反被别人轻看，本来病的碍了事，反说自己看的碍了事；这样，使医生不敢大胆给群众看病，怕说自己有政治问题。医生傅免之说：“给群众看病时，因自己成份不好，怕戴帽子，老是束手束足不大胆，本来有些病自己能看了，也故意推脱不看”。（二）到别村给群众治病，正轮着自己出差，如不去，又怕群众反映自己架子大；如去，村上就要给觅差、出差米。医生刘振堂说：“去年农忙时，到别村给群众看病，误了生产，又出了差米二百多斤。”（三）感到当医生在村里没地位，给群众看病，连饭也吃不开，结果一年四季误工，生活没办法，遭到家庭埋怨。接着刘区长发言，首先说明区村干部过去存在“左”倾思想，看不起医务人员，认为凡是当医生的，都有特务嫌疑；不照顾医生的实际困难。其次，将医生提出的以下三个问题予以解决：一、所有医生，只要真心诚意给群众看病，政府一定要保障他们，并发给行医证；过去错斗或划错成份的要改变过来，没收了医生的药物等，要保证退还。二、给群众看病，轮到自己出差时，要免差，耽误了生产，村里要设法助耕。三、看病时，只要群众自愿给医生谢礼，政府不能限制。医生思想问题解决后，便分组交流医疗经验，并订出今后的治疗计划：（一）每个基点的医生，以小组为单位，负责看全基点病人。（二）那个基点病人多、医生少，由六区联社负责调剂。（三）每星期各基点医生，向区联社医务主任汇报情况。（四）半个月全区医生集会一次，总结医疗工作、交流经验，提高医生技术。壶关二、六区医生也先后开了全区医生会议，检讨过去的缺点，订出全区防疫治疗计划。六区医生按地区分成七个小组，划定地区，由小组长领导各地区的治疗，决定每半个月分两处开大会一次。交流治疗经验，并在会上研究出许多防疫简方。二区医生除一般治疗外，专门组织了许多庙会减价治疗所，收到很大成绩；好牢村医疗所在该村三月十五大会上，共看病一百三十四人、牲口十九头。
