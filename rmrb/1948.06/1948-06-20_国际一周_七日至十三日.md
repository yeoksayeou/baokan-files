　　International Week
  　July 7th - 13th
    In the United States, the mass movement against the Mundt Bill (a fascist anti-communist bill proposed by Congressman Mundt) continues to develop across all strata of society. The 48 branches of the New York Youth for Wallace Committee held a grand mass meeting in New York, with thousands of people signing on the spot to oppose the Mundt Bill. Various American youth groups have also formed the "National Youth Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill." The editorial departments of the progressive publications "New Masses" and "Mainstream" convened a symposium of educators and writers. The famous novelist Howard Fast said at the meeting: "The author of this bill should be listed among the most despicable people." Senators Thomas and others also expressed their opposition to the bill.
    Contrary to the estimates of the American reactionaries, the Third Party movement led by Wallace is growing stronger day by day. To date, new parties have been established in 25 of the 48 states in the United States, of which new parties in eleven states have completed the registration procedures to participate in the presidential election and can legally conduct election campaigns. New parties in five other states are about to be established. Although it has a short history and is subject to various oppressions and restrictions by the reactionaries, the Third Party has won the support of many workers, farmers, office workers, students, and intellectuals. The scale of the Third Party movement's development is "a sign of the American people's deep dissatisfaction with the policies of Truman and the Republican Party" (Soviet Bolshevik magazine). Truman's political tour, which began on the 3rd, was met with disgust by the masses everywhere. In Omaha, Nebraska, a hall that could accommodate 10,000 people had only a mere 1,200 people come to listen to the President's speech, which is proof that the reactionary Democratic leaders have lost the support of the people.
    As the various reactionary groups in the United States intensify their internal struggles due to the approaching election, and as the reactionary artificial war clamor has been further exposed, a new chaos and quarrel has arisen within the American reactionaries over the issue of "foreign aid." The U.S. House of Representatives passed a new bill on the 4th to cut the cost of the "foreign aid plan," which aroused the confusion and opposition of another group of reactionaries headed by Marshall and Vandenberg, who believed that the "reduction" would affect the "prestige" of the United States to its lackeys. This bill reduces the total amount of "foreign aid" expenses already approved by Congress from $6,533,710,000 to $5,980,071,000; at the same time, it extends the time for its expenditure from twelve months to fifteen months. Therefore, this is effectively equivalent to a reduction of 25% of the entire plan. As for the $463 million aid plan for Chiang Kai-shek, it was cut by $63 million, and due to the extension of the expenditure time by three months, according to the Central News Agency, this "is equivalent to a reduction of 35.5% of the original plan." Although this bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is still awaiting discussion in the Senate, and although the faction of American big capitalists who benefit the most from "foreign aid" will rise up in opposition, it has caused serious panic in the British, French, and Chiang governments. British officials expressed "disappointment and concern" about this; France was "surprised and displeased"; and the Chiang government complained that "American diplomacy and military strategy no longer regard China as a forward post." The weakness of U.S. imperialism's foreign policy and the pitiful appearance of its lackeys have once again become very obvious in this quarrel.
    Following the reduction of reparations to Finland, the Soviet government announced on the 7th that, starting from July 1st, it would reduce the remaining 50% of reparations from Romania and Hungary to the Soviet Union in order to meet the desire of the two countries to strive to restore and develop their national economies. This sincere assistance from the Soviet government to Romania and Hungary stands in sharp contrast to the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism under the guise of "economic assistance." The newspaper Izvestia commented on this event, saying: "This action of the Soviet government to truly help small peace-loving countries is completely different from the behavior of certain great powers that use economic 'assistance' to make small countries subservient to the interests of great powers. When the latter kind of 'assistance' is examined, it proves to be a disguised plan."
    The so-called London Six-Nation Conference, headed by the United States, which conspired to split Germany, ended on June 1st after 38 days of meetings. The Six-Nation Conference signed the so-called "London Agreement." According to L'Humanité, this agreement guarantees the basic goals of the United States, namely, to control the Ruhr and establish a West German government. The "London Agreement" aroused a wave of protests in European countries, especially in Germany and France. The German People's Council, which is currently the only national representative body of the German people, lodged a strong protest on behalf of the entire German nation. The People's Council "demands that every German not participate in the action of splitting Germany; and urges German citizens to participate in the signature campaign for the German unification referendum." The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué on the 10th, calling on all workers and democratic forces to oppose this decision. The foreign policy of the Schuman government, which betrays the security of France, has also caused important disputes within the French ruling class. The position of the Schuman cabinet has been further weakened as a result. As for the Soviet Union's attitude, the New Times magazine put it very clearly: "Those politicians who believe that the German question can be solved without the Soviet Union are greatly mistaken. The Western countries' wish to unilaterally decide the peace of Germany and Europe is completely vain."
    Another noteworthy event this week is the important statement issued by the Greek Provisional Democratic Government on the 1st. This statement pointed out that the current situation in Greece is: the Athens petty court's "all military offensives have failed," and the economic situation is also "rapidly deteriorating." On the side of the democratic government, the Democratic Army is "achieving significant victories" in areas such as the Morea Peninsula and Epirus, and "the connection between the liberation movement and the people is becoming closer and closer." However, the Democratic Government, "based on the interests of the country" (according to the General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party), put forward in the statement suggestions for establishing peace in Greece under the following conditions: ensuring the democratic way of life of the Greek people; maintaining the national sovereignty and independence of Greece; ending all foreign interference so that the Greek people can freely solve their own destiny. This statement by the Greek Democratic Government has won the sympathy and support of the Greek people and peace-loving people all over the world, but the "royalist fascist government, which is trying to avoid ending foreign interference" (according to the General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party), has rejected the suggestion of the Greek Democratic Government. This once again proves to the world that "it (the Athens government) should bear the responsibility for the continuation of the Greek civil war" (statement by the British League for Greek Democratization).

　　国际一周
  　七日至十三日
    在美国，各阶层反对蒙特法案（众议员蒙特所提出的法西斯化的反共法案）的群众运动，仍在继续发展中。纽约青年拥护华莱士委员会的四十八个分会，在纽约举行了盛大的群众大会，有数千人当场签名反对蒙特法案。美国各青年团体并组成了“全国青年争取打败蒙特法案委员会”。进步刊物“新群众”与“主流”的编辑部召开了教育家与文艺作家的座谈会。名小说家费斯特在会上说：“这一法案的作者，应列名于最卑鄙的人群中。”参议员汤姆斯等人亦表示反对该法案。
    与美国反动派的估计相反，华莱士领导的第三党运动正日益壮大。到目前为止，美国四十八州中已有二十五州成立了新党，其中十一个州的新党已办完参加总统竞选的登记手续，可以合法地进行竞选。另五个州的新党亦即将成立。虽然历史很短并受反动派各种压迫限制，第三党仍然博得了众多的工人、农民、机关职工、学生及知识分子的拥护。第三党运动发展的规模，正是美国人民“对杜鲁门和共和党政策深深不满的标志”（苏联布尔什维克杂志）。杜鲁门于三日开始的政治旅行，到处为群众所厌弃。内布拉斯加州俄马哈城可容万人的大厅中，仅有寥寥的一千二百人来听这位总统的演说，就是反动的民主党领袖丧失人心的证明。
    当美国各反动集团因大选迫近而加剧其内部斗争的时候，当反动派人为的战争叫嚣已进一步被戳穿的时候，美国反动派内部在“援外”问题上发生了新的混乱与争吵。美国众院于四日通过了削减“援外计划”费用的新议案，引起了以马歇尔，范登堡为首的另一群反动派的困惑与反对，后者认为“削减”将影响美国对其仆从们的“威信”。这一议案将国会已经通过的“援外”费用的总数，从六十五亿三千三百七十一万元，削减为五十九亿八千另七十一万元；同时并将其支用时间由十二个月延长为十五个月。因此这实际上等于削减了全部计划中百分之廿五。至于四亿六千三百万元的援蒋计划，则被削减了六千三百万元，由于支用时间的延长三个月，据中央社称：这“等于削减了原定计划的百分之三十五点五”。美众院所通过的这一议案，虽然尚待参院的讨论，虽然美国大资本家在“援外”中得利最多的一派，还会起来反对，但已在英法蒋政府中引起了严重的恐慌。英官方对此深表“失望而且担心”；法国则“在惊奇之余兼感不悦”；蒋政府则埋怨“美国外交及军事战略，已不以中国为前哨。”美帝国主义之外交政策之软弱无力及其仆从们的可怜相，在这次争吵中，又一次表现得十分明显。
    苏联政府继对芬兰减少赔偿之后，又于七日宣布自七月一日起，减少罗马尼亚与匈牙利对苏联赔偿余额的百分之五十，以满足该两国努力恢复与发展国民经济的愿望。苏联政府这种对罗、匈两国的真诚援助，与美帝国主义的在“经济援助”名义下的侵略行动，适成尖锐的对照。消息报在评论这一事件时说道：“苏联政府这种真正帮助爱好和平小国的行动，是与某些大国利用经济‘援助’来使小国服从大国利益的行为完全不同的。后一种‘援助’一经考证时，便证明是一种伪装的计划。”
    以美国为首阴谋分裂德国的所谓伦敦六国会议，在开会三十八天之后，已于六月一日结束。六国会议签订了所谓“伦敦协定”。据人道报说：这一协定保证了美国的基本目标，即控制鲁尔与成立西德政府。“伦敦协定”在欧洲各国激起抗议的怒潮，特别是在德国和法国。现为德国人民唯一全国性代表机关的德国人民委员会，代表整个德国民族提出强烈抗议。人民委员会“要求每一德国人不参加分裂德国的行动；并敦促德国公民参加德国统一复决签名运动。”法共政治局于十日发表公报，号召所有的工人与民主力量反对这一决定。舒曼政府出卖法国安全的外交政策，在法国统治阶级内部亦引起了重要的纷争。舒曼内阁的地位已因之更为削弱。至于苏联的态度，新时代杂志说得很明白：“那些相信不要苏联也能解决德国问题的政客们是大大的错误了。西方国家企图单方面决定德国与欧洲和平的想望，是完全虚妄的。”
    本周值得注意的另一事件，是希腊临时民主政府于一日发表的重要声明，这一声明指出：希腊的目前形势是：雅典小朝廷在“军事上的一切进攻，均已失败”，经济形势，也正“迅速恶化”。而在民主政府方面，民主军正在摩里亚半岛与爱匹鲁斯等地区“取得显著的胜利”，“解放运动与人民间的联系正愈益紧密”。然而民主政府“基于国家的利益”（希共总书记语），在声明中提出了在下述条件下欢迎旨在建立希腊和平的建议，即：确保希腊人民的民主生活方式；保持希腊的国家主权与独立；结束一切外国干涉，使希腊人民自由地解决自身之命运。希民主政府这一声明博得了希腊人民与全世界爱好和平人士的同情与拥护，但“力图避免结束外国干涉的保皇法西斯政府”（希共总书记语），却拒绝了希腊民主政府的建议。这就再次向全世界证明，“它（雅典政府）应负希腊内战继续的责任”（英争取希腊民主化同盟声明）。（新华社陕北十七日电）
