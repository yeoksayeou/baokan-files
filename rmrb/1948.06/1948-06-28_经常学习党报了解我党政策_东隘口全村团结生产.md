　　Constantly Studying Party Newspapers to Understand Our Party's Policies
  　Dong'aikou Village United in Production
    [Taihang News] Since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline and during the democratic party rectification in certain key point villages, the middle peasants and village cadres in Dong'aikou Village, Zuoquan Third District, had some ideological fluctuations. Because they regularly read Party newspapers and understood the Party's policies, the fluctuations were quickly eliminated, and everyone united to engage in production. Village cadres and the masses formed reading groups, regularly reading newspapers during their spare time and mealtimes, and resolving ideological concerns at any time. Village cadres often studied their work according to the policies and tasks proposed by the Party newspapers. They also understood from reading the newspapers the principle that "only active work can offset mistakes; lying down and doing nothing is adding mistake upon mistake." Village head Zhang Tong and branch secretary Huangfu ＠ said, "The newspaper publishes things clearly, and we can do things accordingly after studying it. Who else do we trust if we don't trust the Party newspaper!" Therefore, the two of them always actively and responsibly led the work without any negative thoughts. In order to spread the news from the newspapers to the masses, they organized four reading groups at mealtimes. Each group selected a dedicated person to read the newspaper. When attending civil school classes, they raised any unclear news from mealtimes to help everyone study. For example, when the newspaper published issues such as compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants, everyone initially couldn't understand it. Later, combined with the newspaper's explanation, it was clarified that if they were not resettled and organized for production now, they would have nothing to eat in the autumn and would have to steal and beg, which would still be our peasants' concern. This made everyone understand. (Editor's note: Compensating middle peasants is because they were wrongly struggled, not because of fear that the middle peasants would steal; resettling landlords and rich peasants is because some places had committed leftist adventurist errors in the past, and it is necessary to correct this error, not because of fear that the landlords would steal. Saying that resettlement and compensation are done out of fear of them stealing and begging is equivalent to covering up the errors of leftist adventurism. This way of stating the reasons is insufficient and unclear, and it cannot truly clear the masses' minds.) Everyone carefully studied the "Letter to Peasants, Party Members, and Village Cadres" issued by the Taihang District Party Committee on May 31, which further thoroughly resolved the ideological concerns of village cadres, middle peasants, and all levels, and clarified that the current priority is to do a good job in production with all efforts, greatly promoting the production movement. The whole village established a production committee composed of seven people, and reorganized and organized nine mutual aid groups based on the principle of voluntary combination. Using the method of flexible work-point calculation, work-points were determined daily based on the quality of labor. The group members felt it was very fair. The number of livestock in the whole village increased by ten compared to last year, and spring plowing and sowing were completed ten days earlier than last year. The whole village followed the call of the Party newspaper and achieved united production among all levels. Middle peasants were able to concentrate on production, and landlords and rich peasants were also absorbed into mutual aid. Rich peasant Huangfu Hao had no grain seeds, and the mutual aid group implemented adjustments. Landlord Huangfu Yan had never worked before, and the mutual aid group promoted and led him to carry coal with the group members. He was also able to match a full laborer in the mutual aid group, and all the land has been sown. From February to May, the village not only completed sowing but also carried out sideline production under the active leadership of the village head and branch secretary. All 40 livestock in the village were organized to carry coal, and all labor was organized to build kilns, transport lime, weave grass, and carry slate. Three kilns were built for a certain unit. The original plan was to complete it with 180 workdays, but it was completed with only 120 workdays. In total, the village's sideline production earned 4,522,500 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency) in four months. Currently, the male and female labor in the village are starting to hoe the first round of seedlings. Group members said, "Hoe the seedlings when they are big. If we don't hoe the seedlings and engage in sideline production, we will subsidize the grain shortage."

　　经常学习党报了解我党政策
  　东隘口全村团结生产
    【太行讯】左权三区东隘口村在土地法大纲颁布以后，及某些基点村民主整党期间，中农和村干部思想上曾有过一些波动。因为经常阅读党报，了解了党的政策，波动迅速消除，大家团结起来搞生产。村干和群众成立了读报小组，经常在闲时，饭场读报，随时解决思想顾虑。村干经常依照党报提出的方针、任务来研究工作。并从读报中了解了“只有积极工作，才能以功抵过；躺倒不干是错上加错”的道理。村长张通和支书皇甫＠说：“报上登的清，学习下就能照着办事。咱不信党报还信啥哩！”因此他两人始终积极负责的领导工作，没有任何消极思想。他们为了把报纸上的消息深入到群众中去，便在饭场里组织了四个读报组。每组选出专人负责念报。到民校上课时，将饭场上没弄清的消息提出帮助大家研究。如报上登出补偿错斗中农与安置地富等问题，起初大家弄不通，后来结合报纸讲明，如果现在不安置，不组织他们生产，秋天他们没吃的，就要偷人、讨饭，还不也是咱农民的事？这样大家就想通了。（编者按）：补偿中农是因为斗错了，并非怕中农偷人；安置地富是因为过去曾有些地方犯了左倾冒险的错误，是要纠正这个错误，亦非怕地主偷人。说是怕他们偷人、讨饭才安置、补偿，这等于把左倾冒险主义的错误掩盖过去。这样说理由是不充分不明确的，也是不能使群众思想真正打通的。）大家详细研究了五月卅一号太行区党委发表的告农民、党员及村干书，更彻底解决了村干、中农及各阶层的思想顾虑，明确了当前要以全力搞好生产，大大推进了生产运动。全村成立起七人组成的生产委员会，以自愿结合的原则重新整顿、组织起九个互助组。用死工活分的折工方法，每天按劳动好坏订一次分，组员感觉很公道，全村牲畜比去年增多十头，春耕下种比去年早完成十天。全村依照党报号召，作到了各阶层团结生产。中农都能安心生产，同时吸收地主富农参加了互助。富农皇甫浩没有谷籽，互助组实行了调剂，地主皇甫琰没劳动过，互助组推动带领他和组员们一块担煤，在互助组里也能顶上全劳力，地已全部下种。该村从二月到五月，不但完成了下种，在村长、支书积极领导下，还进行了副业生产。全村四十头牲口组织起来驮煤送炭，全体劳力组织起来打窑、运送石灰、编草、背石板，给某部打窑三眼，原计划一百八十个工完成，结果只用了一百二十个工。总计四个月内，全村副业生产赚钱四百五十二万二千五百元（冀钞）。现全村男女劳力正在着手锄第一遍小苗，组员们说：“苗大锄苗，不锄苗搞副业，补助粮食欠缺。”
