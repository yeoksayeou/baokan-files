Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS News Agency reported: The Soviet New Era magazine published on June 9th carried an editorial on the Palestine question, which stated: The Security Council is not taking effective measures to expel the invading forces from Palestine and prevent their re-entry, but is instead conducting endless debates. These debates often only serve as a cover for the extremely shameless conspiracies of the great powers that are fueling the conflict in Palestine. Everyone knows that behind the war in Palestine are the private interests of oil cartels. Whether British taxpayers are willing or not, the British government is actually supporting the aggressive Arab armies with financial assistance. The Arab armies are armed and trained by British officers. Many British officers are participating in the war in Palestine. Jewish residential areas are being destroyed by bombs dropped by British-supplied Spitfire aircraft. Regarding Soviet policy, the editorial stated: The Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the following policy: dividing Palestine into two states is the most just and correct solution under the existing circumstances. Therefore, the Soviet Union recognized the State of Israel, which was established in accordance with the United Nations Partition Resolution. If this decision, supported by the authority of the United Nations, is implemented, it will stop the bloodshed in the Near East and establish normal conditions there, and it will also prevent the conspiracies of those countries that are determined to perpetuate their colonial rule in Palestine at any cost.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS News Agency, 10th. The Paris News recently revealed two important and extremely secret treaties signed by Britain with Egypt and Transjordan shortly before the start of the war in Palestine. The purpose of Britain in signing these two secret treaties was to attempt to maintain its position in this strategic area by not keeping armed forces. One is the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, according to which Britain promised to supply Egypt with the war materials necessary to invade Palestine, and Egypt promised to hand over the land acquired by the Egyptian army to Transjordan immediately after the end of the war in Palestine, and Britain would withdraw all British troops from Egypt after Egypt fulfilled its promise. This treaty will also prepare the ground for a possible Anglo-Egyptian alliance, through which, although British troops will withdraw from Egypt, their influence in Egypt will not be greatly weakened, and its defenses in the Suez Canal will be guaranteed. The other treaty is the Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty, according to which Britain will support King Abdullah of Transjordan in establishing a so-called "federal regime" and merging the Negev region of Israel (southern Palestine) into Transjordan. Abdullah, on the other hand, will allow British troops to be stationed in the Negev to defend the Suez.

  　论巴勒斯坦问题
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社讯：六月九日出版的苏联新时代杂志关于巴勒斯坦问题的社论写道：安理会不采取有效措施，以驱逐侵略部队出巴勒斯坦并防止他们的再度侵入，反而进行了无休止的辩论。这些辩论往往只是正在煽起巴勒斯坦冲突的诸强国无耻到极点的阴谋的掩饰。任何人都知道，在巴勒斯坦战争后面的是石油的私利集团。不管英国纳税者是否愿意，英政府实际上以财政援助支持着侵略的阿剌伯军。阿剌伯军是由英国军官武装和训练的。不少的英国军官正参加巴勒斯坦的战争。犹太居民区正为英国供给的喷火式飞机投下的炸弹摧毁着。论及苏联的政策时，社论写道：苏联始终一贯地坚持如下政策：巴勒斯坦分为两个国家是现有情况下最公正和正确的解决办法。因此，苏联承认了遵照联合国分治决定而成立的以色列国。假如联合国权力所支持的这个决定付诸实施，那就会停止近东的流血事件和在该地建立正常情况，也将使那些决心不惜任何代价在巴勒斯坦永久延续其殖民地统治的国家的阴谋不能实现。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社十日电：巴黎新闻报顷揭露在巴勒斯坦战争开始以前不久，英国与埃及及外约旦签订的两个重要极端秘密的条约。英国签订这两个秘密条约的目的，是企图以不保持武装部队的方法，继续保持它在此一战略地区的地位。其一为英埃条约，根据该条约英国应允供给埃及侵略巴勒斯坦所必需的战争物资，埃及则应允在巴勒斯坦战争结束之后，立即将埃军所取得之土地交于外约旦，而英国则在埃及实行其诺言后，自埃及撤退全部英国驻军。这一条约也将为可能的英埃同盟准备基础，通过英埃同盟，英军虽将撤出埃及，但其在埃及之势力不致遭受大的削弱，并能保证其在苏彝士运河的防务。另一条约为英外条约，根据该条约，英国将支持外约旦国王阿布杜拉建立所谓“联邦政权”，将以色列国的内革布区（巴勒斯坦南部）合并于外约旦。阿布杜拉方面则允许英军驻防内革布区以防卫苏彝士。
