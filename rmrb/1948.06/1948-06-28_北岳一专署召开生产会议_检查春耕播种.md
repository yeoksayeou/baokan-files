　　North Yue First District Commissioner's Office Convenes Production Meeting
  　Inspects Spring Planting
    [North Yue News] The North Yue First District Commissioner's Office convened its third production meeting at the beginning of the month, gathering county magistrates, heads of industrial departments, and responsible cadres from production promotion societies from various counties. The meeting lasted for eight days. Commissioner Yao delivered a concluding report, stating: Due to the victory of the North Line Campaign this spring, the peasants' high level of production enthusiasm after land reform, timely spring rains, and the efforts of cadres, agricultural production in the previous stage has achieved great success. In terms of increasing livestock, according to statistics from four districts in Hunyuan, Guangling, Datong, and Lingqiu, and six villages in Yanggao, government loans alone increased livestock by 536 head this spring (excluding those purchased by the masses with private funds). Hunyuan, Lingqiu, and Fanshi have all established "stud farms" specializing in livestock breeding. As of the beginning of the month, regarding land cultivation and planting, Guangling County had sown 90% of its land, and 84 villages in Datong had completed two-thirds of their planting. Lingqiu has a total of 326,391 mu of cultivated land, of which 273,606 mu have been sown. Great achievements have been made in eliminating wasteland. In the second district of Guangling, 9,000 mu of fallow land has been reclaimed, which can increase grain production by 4,000 dan. This spring, the entire district planted 55,517 trees. Counties such as Lingqiu, Hunyuan, Fanshi, and Guangling have organized mass sideline occupations, achieving great profits. Stores spent 1 billion border currency just purchasing Chinese skullcap dug up by the masses, helping them to overcome the spring famine. When Commissioner Yao examined the shortcomings and deviations in the production work of the previous stage, he severely criticized the erroneous thinking and bureaucratic style of some cadres: For example, some cadres believed that "land reform is over, it's time to relax," and "without leadership, the masses will produce on their own." Some counties and districts do not carefully study production instructions, nor do they conduct in-depth investigations and detailed analysis.... In short, some people are not leading practically. For example, in Shuilian Village, Hunyuan, some say that most of the land has been sown, while others say that only half has been sown. What is the actual figure? No one knows. Commissioner Yao said: These are all manifestations of a lack of responsibility to the people and should be resolutely, immediately, and effectively overcome.
    Based on the general policy of production work in the North Yue District, Commissioner Yao proposed: The specific tasks of the First District at present are to help and mobilize the masses to quickly purchase "short-season" seeds, plant late-maturing crops extensively, eliminate wasteland, and strive to reach the planting area of 1946. Call on and organize the masses to cultivate carefully, cultivate fallow land, green manure land, and green fertilizer land. Implement the "Livestock Breeding Reward Method," correctly resolve labor-capital relations in sheep-raising areas, organize and train new and old veterinarians, and prevent and control livestock diseases. In terms of water conservancy, in addition to the Limin Canal in Hunyuan, the Dongsheng Canal in Lingqiu, the Nongshui Canal in Fanshi, the Anle Canal, and the Puji Canal, which are being repaired and managed by special personnel sent by the district and county, small canals should also be widely organized, canal committees should be established, canals should be renovated, disputes should be resolved, and efforts should be made to irrigate all irrigable land. In villages near farms, combine experimentation with planned improvement of agricultural technology and promotion of superior varieties. Pests and diseases should be detected and eliminated immediately. In terms of sideline occupations: plant astragalus membranaceus in large quantities, continue to mobilize the masses to dig mountain products and medicinal materials, and the government should pay attention to helping open up sales channels. Ying County and Yanggao should vigorously form salt and alkali industries, Guangling and Hunyuan should develop coal mining and sulfur burning, and Datong and Yanggao inland areas should continue to organize transportation and sales to solve the current food distribution problem for the masses. Border areas should combine work and rest, helping the masses to rush to cultivate, plant, weed, and harvest, and not allow the enemy to seize a single grain.

　　北岳一专署召开生产会议
  　检查春耕播种
    【北岳讯】北岳一专署于月初召集各县县长、实业科长、生产推进社负责干部开第三次生产会议，历时八天，最后由姚专员做总结报告，他说：由于今春有北线战役的胜利，土改后翻身农民高度的生产热情，及时的春雨，干部的努力等条件，使前阶段的农业生产获得很大成绩。在增加牲畜方面，据浑源、广灵、大同和灵邱四个区、阳高等六个村的统计，今春仅以政府贷款增加的牲畜就有五百三十六头。（群众以私资自买者除外）浑源、灵邱、繁峙都建设了“种畜站”，专门繁殖牲畜。土地耕播截至月初为止，广灵全县已下种百分之九十，大同八十四个村已种完三分之二，灵邱共有耕地三十二万六千三百九十一亩，已播种二十七万三千六百○六亩。消灭荒地成绩很大，在广灵二区已消灭熟荒九千亩，可增产粮食四千大石。全专区今春植树五万五千五百十七株。灵、浑、繁、广等县组织群众副业，均获大利；商店仅收买群众刨出之黄芩即支出边币十亿元，帮助群众渡过春荒。姚专员检查前一阶段生产工作的缺点偏向时，严厉的批评了某些干部的错误思想和官僚主义作风：例如有的干部认为“土改结束了，该松口气了”，“不领导群众自己也会生产”，有些县、区不精研生产指示、不深入调查，细密分析……。总之有些人不是实踏实的去领导。如浑源水连町村，有的说地已大部播种，有的说只种了二分之一，究竟是多少？谁也弄不清。姚专员说：这都是缺乏对人民负责精神的表现，应该坚决、立即、有效的克服。
    姚专员根据北岳区生产工作的总方针，提出：一专区当前的具体任务是帮助与动员群众赶快购买“小日期”籽种，广种晚熟作物，消灭荒地，争取达到四六年的播种面积。号召与组织群众精心细作、耕伏地、压青地、压绿肥。贯彻“牧畜奖励办法”，在养羊地区正确的解决劳资关系，组织与培养新旧兽医，防治畜病。水利除浑源利民渠、灵邱东胜渠、繁峙农水渠、安乐渠、普济渠由专、县派专人领导修治外，并应广泛地组织开小渠，建立渠道委员会，整修渠道，解决纠纷，争取能上水的地全部上水；在农场附近村庄，结合实验有计划的改良农业技术，推广优良品种。病虫害即时发现即时扑灭。在副业方面：大量种植黄蓍，继续发动群众刨山货、药材，政府注意帮助开辟销路。应县、阳高应大力组成盐、硷业，广灵、浑源应娄这挖煤、烧磺，大同、阳高内地应继续组织运销运输，解决群众当前分口粮，边界区应以劳逸结合，帮助群众抢耕、抢种、抢锄、抢收，不让敌人抢走一颗粮。  　　　　（王炎）
