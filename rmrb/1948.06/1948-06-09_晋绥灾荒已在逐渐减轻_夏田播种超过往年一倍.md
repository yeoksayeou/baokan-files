Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. After months of disaster relief efforts by the military and civilians in Jin-Sui, the disaster situation in some areas is gradually alleviating. Hunger in Ningwu and other places is gradually decreasing, and farmers who fled the famine are returning to their villages to resume production. The area sown with summer crops in various places has generally exceeded that of previous years by more than one time. Wheat can be eaten in less than a month. This good news has greatly encouraged the suffering military and civilians of Jin-Sui. At present, all localities are making every effort to ensure that all autumn fields are sown. The Jin-Sui Daily published an editorial on this matter, instructing: "If the autumn fields are left uncultivated, then after the summer harvest is consumed, there will still be famine next spring, and it may be a more severe famine. There are many difficulties in rushing to plant autumn crops at present. It is a time of food shortage, and food seeds are increasingly scarce, but we are confident that we can complete this arduous task because we have the experience of overcoming disasters in recent months. This experience shows that the severity of the disaster varies from place to place, and even within a village, households differ from each other. Mutual assistance in times of difficulty and sharing of resources are the main forces to overcome disasters. Secondly, the government provides loans of grain, which are distributed to the people who are truly in difficulty. The great class-fraternal donation campaigns that are vigorously carried out by various agencies and troops are also auxiliary forces to overcome disasters. If we can truly follow the mass line and go through representative meetings, farmers' associations, and poor peasant groups, then the material conditions for completing the task of sowing all autumn fields are available. What remains is our subjective effort." The editorial finally strongly stated: "Never be satisfied with past achievements and relax the efforts to ensure that all autumn fields are sown."

　　晋绥灾荒已在逐渐减轻
  　夏田播种超过往年一倍
    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋绥军民经数月救灾斗争，部分地区灾情已在逐渐减轻中。宁武等地饥饿现象渐次减少，逃荒农民相继返村生产。各地夏田播种面积，一般均超过往年一倍以上，不及一月即可吃上麦子，此喜讯予晋绥苦难军民以极大鼓舞。目前各地正以全力争取全部秋田下种，晋绥日报特为此发表社论，指示：“如秋田荒下，则夏收食粮吃完后，明春依然是灾荒，而且可能是更严重的灾荒。目前抢种秋田困难很多，正当青黄不接，食粮种籽愈缺，但我们有把握完成这个严重任务，因为我们有了数月来战胜灾荒的经验。这些经验是各地灾情轻重不同，一村之内，户与户亦不同，患难相济，有无相通，是克服灾荒的主要力量。其次是政府贷粮，有重点的发到真正困难的人民手中。各机关部队正蓬勃开展着的伟大阶级友爱的募捐运动，这些又是克服灾荒的辅助力量，如能真正走群众路线，通过代表会、农会及贫农团，则使全部秋田下种这个任务的物质条件是具备了的。剩下的，只是我们的主观努力。”社论最后力称：“决不要满足以往的成绩，而放松了争取秋田全部下种的努力”。
