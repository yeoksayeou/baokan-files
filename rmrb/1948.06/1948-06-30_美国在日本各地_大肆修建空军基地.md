    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】American imperialism is extensively building air force bases in Japan. TASS, Paris, 17th, quoting "Action" weekly, reported that representatives of MacArthur's headquarters have signed contracts with two Japanese construction companies, stipulating that after completing the construction of a U.S. military base in Mizusawa, Iwate Prefecture, in northern Honshu, Japan, the two companies should continue to undertake the construction of several U.S. Air Force bases in various locations in Tochigi Prefecture in central Honshu, Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Kyushu, as well as Akita Prefecture in northern Honshu and Sapporo in Hokkaido. In addition to building new air force bases, other U.S. air force bases in Japan are being expanded and re-equipped. Osaka Airport has been repaired and can accommodate giant aircraft.
