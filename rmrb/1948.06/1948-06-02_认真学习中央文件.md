　　Conscientiously Study Central Documents
　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on the land reform work and the Party rectification work in 1948, and Chairman Mao's speech at the cadre meeting in Jin-Sui are basic documents that every cadre must conscientiously study, and they are also our basic weapons for educating the masses. The Jinnan District Committee's preparation to start with the leading organs and set off a wave of enthusiasm for studying the Party's policies is a good method that is well worth promoting in various regions. In the past, there were indeed many comrades who treated the Party's policies and guidelines with a liberal attitude. They never studied, researched, or conscientiously implemented the Party's policies properly. Instead, they implemented a set of self-righteous policies and strategies that violated unified will and unified discipline, creating a certain state of indiscipline or anarchy, causing great losses to the Party and the people. In order to learn from this lesson, it is required that the Party's leading organs in various regions systematically organize the study of the Party's work instructions for 1948, Chairman Mao's report, and various important instructions from the Central Committee and the Central Bureau, strictly ensuring that every comrade "studies conscientiously, fully understands, and is responsible for strictly abiding by various documents promulgated by the Central Committee, and is not allowed to modify them without authorization." In the study, we must also systematically check our work based on the instructions, distinguish between what is permissible and what is not, correct various deviations, and eliminate various chaotic phenomena among cadres today. In this way, cadres will understand the policies and the entire process of the work, which can minimize one-sidedness and allow us to complete all our work in a timely manner.

　　认真学习中央文件
    中共中央关于一九四八年土地改革工作和整党工作的指示和毛主席在晋绥干部会上讲话是每个干部必须认真学习的基本文件，也是我们对群众进行教育的基本武器。冀南区党委准备从领导机关做起，掀起一个学习党的政策热潮。是一个颇值得各地推广的好办法。过去，确有不少同志以自由主义态度对待党的政策方针，他们从来不好好学习、研究和认真贯彻党的政策，反而实行一套自以为是的违背统一意志统一纪律的极端有害的政策策略，造成某些无纪律或无政府状态，给予党和人民以极大的损失。为了接受这一教训，要求各地党的领导机关有计划的组织对党的一九四八年工作指示，毛主席报告以及中央和中央局各项重要指示的学习工作，严格做到使每个同志“对中央颁布的各种文件，认真学习，完全了解，并责成他们严格遵守，不准擅自修改”，在学习中还要依据指示有系统的检查我们的工作，将许可做的事与不许可做的事，分清界限，纠正各种偏向，扫除今天干部中各种混乱现象。这样干部即懂得了政策，又懂得了工作的全部过程，就可以尽量避免片面性，使我们全部工作不失时机的得以全部完成。
