Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 22nd. After a month and a half of fighting from April 16th to the end of May, the army and people of the area south of the Han River in the Jianghan Liberated Area annihilated more than 2,800 enemies, victoriously shattering the Chiang gang's third "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the area. Last winter and this spring, our army shattered the Chiang gang's first and second "encirclement and suppression" campaigns south of the Han River, annihilating more than 2,000 enemy troops. In order to ensure the Jiang defense of Jingzhou (i.e. Xuzhou City) and Shashi City, the Chiang gang adopted the cruel "Three Alls Policy" in terms of tactics, namely "firmly establishing strongholds, connecting lines, and expanding the area," as well as the so-called "total war" combining military, political, economic, and special agent means. In addition to the three regiments of the 192nd Brigade, the two regiments of the Hunan First Security Brigade, the 49th Regiment of the 56th Division, and the Security General Team of the Fourth Administrative Office of Hubei Province around the wounded soldiers' areas, they also gathered the 244th and 245th Regiments of the 82nd Brigade of the 52nd Division, the 99th Regiment of the 33rd Brigade, and the 3rd Regiment of the Hubei First Security Brigade, totaling eleven regiments of troops. Furthermore, they reorganized a large number of habitual bandits, vagrants, local bullies, and despots into "suppression teams," under the unified command of the 16th Pacification Headquarters. Starting in mid-April, relying on the strongholds along the Hanyi Highway and the Yangtze River coast, they launched simultaneous encirclement and suppression campaigns from the east, west, and south, attempting to compress and annihilate our army. In order to thwart this arrogant plan, our sub-district armed forces preemptively struck, and with the help of the broad masses, when the enemy had not yet completed all deployments, they took the initiative to attack. On April 16th, in Zhangjiagang, north of Qianjiang, they annihilated the majority of the 244th Regiment of the 82nd Brigade, which had penetrated into our interior along the western front. The victorious prelude to the anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign was thus unveiled. On the front lines, starting on the 28th of this month, our army successively repelled the attacks of three regiments of Chiang's bandits, including the 99th Regiment and the Hubei First Security Brigade, in the Hanyang-Mianyang area. At the same time, another unit of our army crossed the Han River to the north, attacking the enemy's central stronghold, Xianren Town (northeast of Mianyang), from both sides. The defending enemy, the 99th Regiment, was attacked from the front and rear and had no choice but to abandon the town and flee. On May 16th, our army suddenly launched a fierce offensive on the western front, capturing the important town of Shayang (northwest of Qianjiang) on the west bank of the Han River in one fell swoop. Furthermore, advancing westward along the Hankou-Yichang Highway, they successively captured the important towns of Hougang, Shiliqiao, Silongqiao, and Longhuiqiao northeast and north of Jingzhou, directly threatening the suburbs of Jingzhou and Shashi. At this point, the Chiang army was caught in a chaotic situation, fearing both the loss of Jingzhou and Shashi and the advance of our army across the river while we were victorious. Therefore, in a frantic effort, they hurriedly deployed their main force to defend the city, and at the same time, urgently transferred the 490th Regiment stationed in Fengkou to retreat to Xindi (40 kilometers south of Mianyang) on the north bank of the Yangtze River. At this point, the Chiang bandits' "encirclement and suppression" deployment was completely disrupted. Seizing this opportunity, with extremely proactive and rapid action, they swung their spears towards the southeast, annihilating the large and small squadrons of the Fourth Security Brigade at Yajiaomiao (east of Shahe). Subsequently, by attacking the enemy's outer defenses and surrounding areas, and also monitoring Pujishan north of Jianli, within the two days of the 29th and 30th, they completely annihilated a regiment and a battalion of the 192nd Brigade, totaling more than 1,500 people. Under the combined attack of this great victory of our army, the enemies at various strongholds along the Jiang defense hurriedly fled back. The Chiang gang's so-called "final decisive battle" this time was completely bankrupt. As a result, our army in the area controlled 300 li of the Han River line, from the Han River in the north to the banks of the Yangtze River in the south, from Hanyi Estuary in the west to Dongma on the south bank of Hanchuan in the east. There are no enemy forces in this vast area.

  　粉碎匪第三次“清剿”
  　歼灭蒋匪两千八百余 
    控制汉水线三百余里
    【新华社中汉前线廿二日电】江汉解放汉水以南地区军民，经过四月十六日至五月底一个半月的战斗，歼敌两千八百余人，胜利的粉碎了蒋帮对该区第三次的“清剿”。当去冬今春我军粉碎了蒋帮对汉水以南之第一二两次“清剿”，并歼灭匪军两千余人，蒋帮为确保荆（州即徐州市）沙（市）江防，采取所谓“稳脚固点、联线扩面”的战术上的残酷的“三光政策”，以及军事、政治、经济、特务相结合的所谓“总体战”。除伤员病区周围之一九二旅三个团，湖南保一旅两个团，五十六师之四十九团及湖北第四专署保安总队外，又纠集五十二师之八十二旅的二四四团、二四五团，三三旅之九九团、湖北保一旅之第三团等共十一个团的兵力，并且收编了大批惯匪、流氓、地痞、恶霸等组织“清剿队”，由第十六绥署统一指挥，于四月中旬起以汉宜公路及长江沿岸各驻点的依托，分向东西南三面同时合力进剿，妄图使我军压缩围歼。为粉碎此一狂妄计划，我分区武装先发制人，在广大群众帮助下，当敌人尚未全部布置就绪时，主动出击，首于四月十六日在潜（江）北之张家港，将向西线伸入我内地之八二旅二四四团大部歼灭。反“清剿”之胜利序幕就此揭开。前线方面：我军本月月廿八日起，在汉（阳）沔（阳）地区，先后击溃蒋匪九九团、湖北保一旅等共三个团的进攻，同时我军另部北渡汉水，夹击匪中心据点仙人镇（在沔阳东北），守敌九九团腹背受敌，不得不弃镇逃窜。五月十六日，我军又突然于西线发动猛烈攻势，一举攻克汉水西岸重镇沙洋（潜江西北），并且由沿汉（口）宜（昌）公路西下，连克荆州东北及以北之后港、十里桥、四龙桥、龙会桥等重镇，直迫荆州与沙市城郊。此际，蒋军手忙脚乱，既怕失掉荆沙，又怕我军乘胜渡江。乃一面慌忙之中主力守城，一面急调驻峰口之四九零团退守长江北岸之新堤（从沔阳以南四十余公里）。至此，蒋匪的“清剿”布署，全被打乱。无复乘此机会，以极主动迅速的动作，挥戈指向东南，在丫角庙（沙河以东）歼敌保四旅之大小中队。接着又以攻敌外防外围，又监利于北之普济山，二十九、三十两日内，全歼一九二旅一个团又一个营共一千五百余人。在我军这一大捷的夹攻下，江防沿岸各据点的敌人纷纷慌忙回窜。蒋帮此次所吹嘘的“总决战”，乃告全部破产。使该区我军控制汉水线三百里，北至汉水，南至长江岸边，西至汉宜口，东至汉川南岸东马，此广大地方内无敌纵。
