　　Jilu Yu Local Armed Forces Cooperated with Main Forces in Combat
　　Killing and Capturing Over 300 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits from the 5th Reorganized Division
    [Jilu Yu 25th Dispatch] The Jilu Yu local armed forces, cooperating with the main forces in combat, annihilated over 300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 5th Reorganized Division south of Ju County. On June 15th, the 96th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Reorganized Division advanced towards Zhangfengji, Huayuan, and Lizhuang, south of Ju County. Our army bravely resisted, and after six hours of fighting, the enemy was unable to approach our positions. The bandit leader Qiu Qingquan urgently dispatched his elite 200th Brigade from sixty miles away to reinforce them that evening. At dawn on the 16th, the enemy's 599th Regiment and 600th Regiment, under the cover of eight tanks, launched a frenzied assault. Several charges were repelled by us. By dusk, the enemy was unable to sustain the attack and fled back. Our positions remained firmly in our hands. In this battle, we killed over 300 enemies, captured over ten, and seized a portion of their equipment.
