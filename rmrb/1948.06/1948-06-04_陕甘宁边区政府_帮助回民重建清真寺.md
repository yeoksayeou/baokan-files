Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st dispatch: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government is currently helping the Hui people in Yan'an City rebuild mosques destroyed by bandits. A new foundation has been determined in Nanguan, and construction will begin soon. The former Yan'an Mosque was located in Wenhua Gou in the northern suburbs and was established in 1939. In the past, Hui compatriots in Yan'an City and Hui people from various agencies and schools went to the temple every season to hold commemorations and study the classics. After the bandits occupied Yan'an, all the furniture in the temple and 500 shi of stored grain were looted by the bandits. The bandit troops often gambled in the temple halls, and sometimes even forcibly dragged women to the back of the hall for rape. In the months before the bandit troops fled, they completely destroyed the temple, demolished the main hall, cut down all the trees, and the dormitories were also destroyed. Even the stone steps were completely removed. This kind of atrocity aroused extreme indignation among the Hui people.

  　帮助回民重建清真寺
    【新华社西北一日电】陕甘宁边区政府现正帮助延安市回民重建被胡匪破坏之清真寺，已在南关确定新地基，不日即将动工。延安前清真寺位于北郊文化沟，建立于一九三九年。过去延市回胞及各机关学校的回民，均按季到该寺举行纪念，研究经典。胡匪侵占延安后，该寺全部家具及五百石存粮，全遭胡匪抢掠而去。匪军更经常在该寺殿堂聚赌，有时竟强拉妇女到殿后奸污，匪军逃窜前数月，又将该寺彻底破坏，拆毁大殿，砍光树木，宿舍也被破坏，甚至连石级也被撤除精光。此种暴行，引起回民极度愤慨。
