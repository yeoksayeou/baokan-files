Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. The South Korean people's movement to resist the fake elections has plunged the South Korean reactionaries into a state of extreme isolation. Newspapers in Seoul, Korea, published statements from several South Korean democratic parties and mass organizations protesting this fake election. The Labor People's Party's statement pointed out: The purpose of the South Korean split election is to disintegrate and colonize Korea. The Democratic Patriotic Youth League believes that the anti-democratic nature of the South Korean fake election is even worse than the Greek autocratic fascist fake election. The Central Committee of the Democratic Independence Party and the South Korean Buddhist Association both declared this fake election invalid. The Labor Masses Party pointed out: "Syngman Rhee is trying to become president with the help of the US military." These parties and organizations unanimously demanded that free national elections be held after foreign troops withdrew. Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik, leaders of the South Korean right-wing parties, also issued a statement on the 6th after returning to South Korea from the Pyongyang Conference, opposing the divisive fake election.

　　南鲜人民抵制伪选
  　反动派极孤立
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】南鲜人民对于伪选的抵制运动，已使南鲜反动派陷入极端孤立的困境。朝鲜汉城报纸刊登了若干南鲜民主党派和民众团体抗议这次伪选的声明。劳动人民党的声明指出：南鲜分裂选举的目的，在于使朝鲜解体和殖民地化。民主的爱国青年同盟认为，南鲜伪选之反民主性，比希腊专制法西斯伪选犹有过之而无不及。民主独立党中央委员会与南鲜佛教协会，均宣告这次伪选无效。劳动群众党指出：“李承晚竟想依靠美军的帮助当总统。”这些政党和团体一致要求在外国军队撤出之后，举行全国自由的普选，南鲜右翼政党领袖金九与金奎植自参加平壤会议返南鲜后，亦于六日发表声明，反对分裂的伪选。
