[Taihang News] In Pingshun Fifth District's Beishe, during the Party rectification and land reform movement, the sowing of over 2,400 mu of land was completed in twelve days, faster and better than in previous years. The reason for this achievement is the leadership of the Communist Party branch, which permeated the entire process of Party rectification and production. The work team corrected the past erroneous method of "kicking away the old foundation." After Party members underwent Party rectification studies, they all actively played a leading role in production, bringing the masses and the Party closer together. The work team designated a specific person to lead production. At a joint meeting of Party members, cadres, and labor heroes, branch secretary Cao Maizhi called on Party members, saying, "After Party rectification, Party members must establish a democratic work style, go among the masses, humbly learn from the masses, transform themselves, and actively lead production." Old hero Cao Xiaogou said, "Before Party rectification, I was so worried I couldn't sleep; after Party rectification, I think so much I can't sleep (meaning how to do a good job and be a good Party member)." With Party members, heroes, and cadres taking the lead, each team formulated a plan for a sowing blitz, accurately calculating and allocating land and labor. When the blitz began, able-bodied laborers did heavy work, semi-able-bodied laborers planted seeds, delivered food, and broke up clods, and even merchants took time off to work in the fields. After an enthusiastic blitz, the entire sowing plan was completed in twelve days. During the movement, cadres were assigned to lead various aspects of production, with labor heroes combining with the technical committee to lead agriculture, and the cooperative specializing in leading sideline occupations. Mass blackboards were used to commend progress in a timely manner. Finally, at the production summary meeting, forty production models were selected, including seven Party members. Labor hero Cao Xiaogou was selected as a first-class model.

　　支部村干积极领导平顺北社及时下种
    【太行讯】平顺五区北社在整党与土改运动中，十二天完成了二千四百余亩的下种工作，比往年又快又好。所以作到这样，是由于共产党支部的领导，贯串在整党与生产的全部过程。工作组纠正了过去“一脚踢开老基础”的错误办法，党员经过了整党学习，在生产中都积极的起着带头作用，使群众与党更加接近。工作组指定专人领导生产，在党员、干部、劳英联席会上，支书曹买支号召党员说：“经过整党，党员一定要树立民主作风，到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，改造自己，积极领导生产。”老英雄曹小狗说：“整党前怕的睡不着，整党后想的睡不着（意思是如何好好干，当个好党员）”。经过党员英雄干部带头，各组都订出了突击下种计划，精确计算与调配了土地和劳畜力。突击开始，全劳力干重活，半劳力点种送饭打圪拉，商人也抽空下地。经过热烈突击后，十二天全部完成下种计划。在运动中干部们分工领导各种生产，劳动英雄结合技术委员会领导农业，合作社专领导副业。利用大众黑板及时表扬，最后在总结生产大会上选出四十名生产模范，其中有七名党员，劳英曹小狗被选为一等模范。
