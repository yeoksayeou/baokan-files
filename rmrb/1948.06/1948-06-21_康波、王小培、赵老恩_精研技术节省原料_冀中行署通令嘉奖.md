　　Diligent Study of Technology Saves Raw Materials
　　Jizhong Administrative Office Issues Commendation
　　[Jizhong News] Yonghua Match Company in Bo City recently bought a large batch of counterfeit saltpeter (the main raw material for matches), which could not be used. Jizhong Industrial Company specially sent Comrade Kang Bo to help study the refining process. Comrade Kang Bo, on the one hand, taught the purchasing staff how to identify the real product; on the other hand, he taught the workers the refining methods. In the refining process, he also absorbed the opinions of the workers, learning a method of precipitating flour from a worker who made dry powder, dissolving, precipitating, and crystallizing impurities such as alkali noodles, small salt, soil powder, saltpeter, and baking soda, and after extracting them, the remainder became pure saltpeter. After that, Comrade Kang Bo and the factory employees studied how to make matches easy to light and save money. After several experiments, the results were: first, the method of mixing the medicine was changed, reducing the amount of gum arabic, red phosphorus, and saltpeter, and increasing the amount of white jade powder. In this way, 31,080 yuan could be saved for each batch of medicine; second, the match head was reduced in size, reducing the amount of medicine used per large box of matches from more than two batches to one batch and seven tenths, saving 350,000 yuan per box. This method of mixing the medicine makes the glue less prone to moisture, easier to light, and ensures that every match is safe. The factory has now begun to use the new method for manufacturing.
　　Wang Xiaopei, a technician at the Minli Match Factory in Shenze County, changed his conservative thinking on technology after attending the industrial conference, and actively taught apprentices. Recently, he created a method of using self-made bone ash to replace imported whitening powder. This can save 35,000 yuan per box (204 packs) of match medicine. This not only reduces costs, but also plays a significant role in resisting Chiang-American goods. Zhao Laoen, a worker at the toothbrush factory of the Xinji Workers' Union General Office, worked with the factory staff to study and improve production tools and technology, creating a polishing machine and a grinder, which increased output by nine times, taking toothbrush production a step forward. Because of the efforts of Comrades Kang Bo and the other two to overcome difficulties and actively research and create, the Jizhong Administrative Office not only awarded them first-class certificates of merit and issued a commendation, but also gave them bonuses according to the size of their achievements. The General Trade Union also called on all employees to learn from them.

  　精研技术节省原料
    冀中行署通令嘉奖
    【冀中讯】泊市永华火柴公司，日前买来大批假冒的盐卜（火柴的主要原料），不能使用。冀中实业公司特派康波同志，前往帮助研究提制。康波同志一方面教给了采购人员怎样识别；一方面教给工人提炼办法。在提炼中，他也吸取了工人的意见，向一个做干粉的工人学会了使面粉沉淀的办法，把杂质碱面、小盐、土粉子、火硝、小苏打等溶解、沉淀、结晶及简单的化学变化，提出来后，剩下的就变成纯盐卜了。此后康波同志又与厂内职工研究，如何使火柴爱着、省钱。经过数次试验结果：一是改变了配药方法，减少药胶、赤磷、盐卜，增加白玉粉。这样每一料药可省三万一千八十元；二是把火柴头改小，每大箱火柴由用两料多药减少至一料七，每箱可省三十五万元。这种配药法胶小不易反潮，容易着，根根保险。现在该厂已着手采用新办法制造。
    深泽县民营民利火柴厂技术人员王小培，自参加工业会议后，改变了技术上的保守思想，积极教导徒工。最近创造用自制骨灰，代替外来胡粉。每箱（二○四包）火柴药可省三万五千元。不仅降低了成本，对抵制蒋美货作用也很大。辛集职工会总社牙刷厂工人赵老恩，与该厂职员共同钻研，改进了生产工具与生产技术，创造了擦亮机和磨粉机后，产量提高九倍，牙刷生产提高一步。由于康波等三位同志努力克服困难，积极研究和创造，冀中行署除给予甲等奖状通令嘉奖外，并按其成绩大小，分别给予奖金。总工会并号召全体职工，向他们学习。
