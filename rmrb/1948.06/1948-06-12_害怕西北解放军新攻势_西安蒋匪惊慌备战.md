　　Fearing New Offensive by Northwest PLA
  　Xi'an Chiang Gang Terrified and Preparing for War
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th】According to reports from various sources: Under the impact of the Northwest People's Liberation Army's continuous victories, the reactionaries in Xi'an are extremely panicked. At the end of last month, just when the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense and the Central News Agency were publicizing the so-called great victory in the Jing River and Wei River valley, Zhu Shaozhou, the Chiang-appointed chairman of Shaanxi Province, told foreign reporters: "The Communists will attack Xi'an again in two or three months," "The Communists are eliminating government troops by 'big fish eats small fish'," "Xi'an is very likely to become the second Taiyuan, Shenyang, and Changchun." Recently, the Chiang gang in Xi'an has been forcibly seizing large numbers of ordinary people to build city defense fortifications, and farmers hundreds of miles away are not spared. At the same time, they are extorting large amounts of grain, forcibly conscripting flour merchants to grind military rations at high speed, causing grain prices in the market to soar, and exorbitant taxes and levies are increasing. The so-called "Suppress-Rebellion-and-Build Donation" alone requires all shops in the city to pay 23 times the business tax, and residents are charged double the housing donation. The people are all resentful, saying, "The money is pressing people so hard that there is no way for the common people to survive." Chiang-appointed officials in the city have also begun to flee, and airplane tickets to Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places are appearing on the black market at high prices. When the PLA besieged Luoyang, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Xi'an had already transported their account books to Chengdu.

　　害怕西北解放军新攻势
  　西安蒋匪惊慌备战
    【新华社陕北九日电】据各方报导：在西北人民解放军连战皆捷的声威震撼下，西安反动派极为惊慌。上月底，正值南京国防部和中央社宣传所谓泾渭河谷大捷之际，蒋记陕省主席祝绍周，却向外国记者说：“共军将于两三月内再度进攻西安”，“共军正以大吃小，消灭政府守军”，“西安很可能成为太原、沈阳、长春第二”。最近西安蒋匪，强抓大批老百姓增筑城防工事，数百里外农民，亦难幸免。同时大量勒索粮食，强征面粉商火速磨制军粮，以致市上粮价猛涨，苛捐杂税越来越多。光是所谓“戡建捐”，全市各商号即需照营业税的二十三倍缴纳，居民则照房捐加倍征收，人民均怨愤地说：“款子逼人，没有老百姓活的路了”。该城蒋记官员，亦开始逃走，去沪渝等地的飞机票，均出现高价黑市。西安中国交通两银行，当解放军围攻洛阳时，已将帐簿带运成都。
