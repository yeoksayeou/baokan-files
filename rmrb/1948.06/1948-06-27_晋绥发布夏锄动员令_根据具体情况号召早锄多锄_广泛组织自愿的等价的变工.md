Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 24th. Spring plowing and sowing work in most areas here has come to an end, and summer weeding has now begun. This year's summer weeding in Jin-Sui is of particular importance and faces particular difficulties compared to previous years. The Jin-Sui Branch Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Border Region Administrative Office recently jointly issued a Summer Weeding Mobilization Order, and the Jin-Sui Daily also published an editorial at the same time. The mobilization order and editorial pointed out that this year's summer weeding work in Jin-Sui is particularly important because: (1) This year's spring plowing and sowing was completed by using allocation methods to seize the time to plant amidst extreme seed shortages. Farmers planted whatever seeds they could get, thus losing the usual planning of agricultural production. Certain crops may have been planted in large quantities, squeezing the time available for weeding together. (2) Summer fields are generally planted more extensively this year, and summer harvest and summer weeding are also squeezed together. (3) Due to a lack of animal power, this spring's sowing was relatively rough. (4) This year's rainfall is abundant, and seedlings are growing quickly, and weeds are also growing very quickly. In short, if we do not weed early, weed extensively, and cultivate carefully this year, it will inevitably reduce the harvest, and may even cause land to be abandoned. At the same time, there are also serious food shortages during the summer weeding period. Some farmers are eating immature wheat and beans prematurely due to a lack of food. This will greatly reduce the harvest. Therefore, the mobilization order and editorial require local Party committees, work teams, governments at all levels, and representative conferences at all levels to attach great importance to summer weeding work and to continue to solve the food difficulties of farmers, focusing on using the remaining disaster relief grain and the fruits of struggle. In addition, mobilize mutual borrowing among farmers (guaranteeing repayment after the harvest); coupled with short-term credit loans provided by the government and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, to overcome the short and arduous period before the summer harvest. At the same time, we should continue to widely organize the voluntary and equivalent exchange of labor that developed during spring plowing, persuade and compel landlords and loafers to participate in labor exchange, and organize every laborer to participate in summer weeding. The organizational forms such as production and disaster relief teams and production and disaster relief committees that emerged in various places during spring plowing, under the leadership of representative conferences, poor peasant associations, and farmers' associations, have proven to be powerful institutions for leading agricultural production and can continue to play their role in summer weeding. The mobilization order and editorial both emphasized that the disaster has not yet passed, and we must oppose blind optimism and laxity, make persistent efforts, and be responsible to the people to the end.

　　晋绥发布夏锄动员令
    根据具体情况号召早锄多锄
  　广泛组织自愿的等价的变工
    【新华社晋绥二十四日电】此间大部分地区春耕播种工作已告结束，目前已开始夏锄。晋绥今年夏锄较往年有特殊重要性及特殊困难。中共晋绥分局及边区行政公署日前特联合发表夏锄动员令，晋绥日报亦同时发表社论。动员令及社论指出晋绥今年夏锄工作特别重要是因为：（一）今年春耕播种是在种籽万分困难中采用调剂办法抢种完成的，农民弄到什么种籽就种什么，因而失掉了农业生产的通常计划性，某种作物可能种得很多，使锄草时间挤在一起。（二）今年夏田一般种得多，夏收与夏锄也挤在一起。（三）因缺乏畜力，今春播种较粗糙。（四）今年雨水多，禾苗长得快，野草也长的很快。总之，今年如不早锄、多锄和精细作务，必将减少收成，甚至可能使土地荒芜。同时，夏锄时期还存在着严重的口粮困难，有的农民因缺乏口粮过早的食用未成熟的麦子和豆子。这将大大减低收成。因此动员令及社论要求各地党委、工作团、各级政府及各级代表会，应十分重视夏锄工作，应继续解决农民口粮困难，有重点的使用其余救灾后及斗争果实粮。并发动农民中的互借（保证收获后归还）；再加上政府、工商局的便利短期信用贷款，以渡过夏收前的一个短短艰苦时期。同时，应继续广泛组织春耕中发展起来的自愿的与等价交换的变工，说服和强制地主及二流子参加变工，组织每一个劳动力参加夏锄。各地在春耕中出现的生产救灾小组、生产救灾委员会等组织形式，在代表会、贫农团及农会领导下，已证明为领导农业生产的有力机构，在夏锄中可继续发挥其作用。动员令及社论均强调灾荒尚未过去，必须反对盲目乐观及松懈的现象，再接再厉，为人民负责到底。
