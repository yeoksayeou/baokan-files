Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—TASS, Prague: The new Czech cabinet held its first meeting on the 16th, discussing and passing the new government's program, which was submitted to the National Assembly for approval on the 17th. Czech Premier Zápotocký announced the new government's program on the same day, stating that the government's primary task is to implement the new constitution passed on May 9th of this year. In terms of domestic policy, the main focus is on ensuring the completion of the two-year economic plan, improving nationalized industry and domestic and foreign trade, creating favorable conditions for small industrialists, artisans, and small merchants, increasing the purchasing power of the Koruna (Czech currency), and establishing district administrative institutions and district national committees in the near future to replace the original provincial committees (Note: This will strengthen the central government's direct leadership over local governments). In terms of foreign policy, Czechoslovakia is willing to maintain friendly relations with all democratic countries in the world on the basis of equal cooperation. The Premier then described the outline of the five-year economic plan that the government will submit to the National Assembly in the autumn, stating that the two-year plan is mainly a recovery plan, while the five-year plan will be a plan to build and transform the Czech economy (Note: The Czech two-year plan stipulates that it will be completed by the end of this year, at which time the national economy will exceed the 1937 level by 10 percent.). The new five-year plan stipulates that domestic manufactured goods and grain consumption will increase by 60 percent compared to pre-war levels within five years. The metal industry will increase by 80 to 90 percent; the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 180 percent; automobile production will increase by 78 percent; iron smelting will increase by 80 percent; steel will increase by 45 percent; rolled steel will increase by 47 percent; electricity production will increase by 48 percent; and the production of small industries and workshops will increase by 60 percent compared to 1948.

The five-year plan also stipulates further development of transportation, housing construction, and general culture and science, as well as improving social insurance, healthcare, and education.
