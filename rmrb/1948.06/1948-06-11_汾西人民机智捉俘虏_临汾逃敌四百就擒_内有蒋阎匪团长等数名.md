Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th.  Farmers in various villages of Fenxi County, Jin-Southwest, have captured more than 400 fleeing enemy soldiers from Linfen in the past half-month. Among them, Zhao Xiangdou, who once served as the division commander of the 69th Division of the Yan Army, Tian Xiangcheng, the commander of the Third Replenishment Training Regiment, and Song Zongwu, the commander of the 88th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Chiang Army, were identified as several high-ranking officers. Song Zongwu was captured by Chen Maotang, a farmer from Hedicun village in the county. When Chen was plowing the field, he happened to encounter militiamen chasing Song. Chen jumped out of the field and held Song down. On the evening of May 22, nine routed enemies sneaked into Shiling Village and seized villager Qi Yongqing to lead them towards Lingshi. Because Qi Yongqing sincerely explained to them the lenient policy of the liberated areas towards prisoners, they changed their minds and asked Qi Yongqing to take them to the democratic government to hand over their guns and surrender. They repeatedly praised, "The people in the liberated areas are so good, so good!" A shepherd boy in Sangyuan Village saw a suspicious person chopping firewood on the mountain and shouted, "You must be a stubborn soldier, quickly surrender your gun! Otherwise, I'll call the militia to catch you." The defeated soldier, disguised as a woodcutter, obediently handed over an American-style machine gun to the shepherd boy and followed the shepherd boy to the village office to surrender. On the evening of May 27, a defeated soldier suddenly arrived at the home of Wang Youqing, a farmer in Xuejiawan, and forced Wang Youqing to cook for him. Seeing that the defeated enemy was hungry and exhausted, Wang took the opportunity while the enemy was eating to suddenly snatch his pistol and capture him.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. After the liberation of Linfen, the Yan bandit army trapped in various counties in central Shanxi were in a state of panic. Fearing the attack of the People's Liberation Army, the defending enemies in each county have forcibly ordered all unripe wheat within five miles of the county seat, on both sides of the highways, and near the strongholds to be cut down. The people in various places are organizing resistance to the Yan bandit's "scorched earth" policy. The enemy in Pingyao forced all the carts and livestock in the villages to be concentrated. Most of the villagers in the city tried to resist and hide. When the Yan bandits arrived at Fengyue Village, they resented the villagers' escape, so they destroyed houses in the village and searched for and killed many old people, children, and women.

　　汾西人民机智捉俘虏
  　临汾逃敌四百就擒
  　内有蒋阎匪团长等数名
    【新华社晋绥八日电】晋西南汾西县各村农民，半月来已俘获由临汾逃出的残敌四百余人。其中并查出曾任阎军六十九师师长的赵向斗、补训三团团长田向成，蒋军三十旅八十八团团长宋宗武等高级军官数名。宋宗武是该县河底村农民陈茂堂俘获的。陈在耕地时，适遇民兵正追捕宋，陈即由田中跃出，将宋抱住。五月二十二日晚，溃敌九人窜入石领村，抓走乡民齐永清向灵石方向带路，因为齐永清诚恳的给他解释了解放区对俘虏的宽大政策，他们就改变主意，要求齐永清带他们找民主政府交枪投诚，他们连声赞叹：“解放区老百姓真好，真好”！桑元村一牧童，曾见一形迹可疑的人在山上打柴，就喊道：“看你一定是个顽军，快缴枪吧！要不，我就喊民兵来捉你”。那个伪装打柴的溃兵，就规规矩矩的把一支美式机枪交给牧童，并随着牧童到村公所投诚。五月二十七日晚，一溃兵突至薛家垣农民王有清家，强迫王有清做饭给他吃，王见溃敌饥饿疲备，就趁敌吃饭时，猛然夺下他的手枪，将他俘获。
    【新华社晋绥七日电】临汾解放后，困守晋中各县的阎匪军，惊慌万状。因惧怕解放军的进攻，各县守敌，已强令将县城周围五里路以内、各公路两侧及各据点附近尚未成熟的麦子，一律割掉。各地民众对于阎匪之“坚壁清野”命令，有组织的进行反抗。平遥之敌，强迫各村大车牲畜全部集中，城内村民多设法抵抗躲藏，阎匪到封岳村时，忌恨该村村民逃避，遂将村中房捣毁，并搜捕残杀老幼妇孺多人。
