　　Party Members Actively Lead Production
    Zanhuang Duhucun Completes Sowing in Time After Rain
  　Heshun District Earns Over 10 Million From Sideline Occupations
    [Taihang News] After rectification, Party members and cadres of Duhucun, Fourth District, Zanhuang, led the masses of the whole village to complete sowing in three days, hoeing and leveling 58 mu of land, and delivering 1,600 loads of fertilizer. On the first day of the fifth lunar month, while it was raining, district cadre An Yungeng immediately coordinated with Li Degong, the secretary of the CCP branch, to convene a meeting of branch members and all village cadres to discuss sowing work. Party member Wang Jinlu said, "In the past, when doing work, I couldn't see it unless others asked me to do it. After Party rectification, I can see it. Once, some demobilized soldiers were sent from the city, and the cadres were busy arranging meals, so I helped the cadres find things. This is a little progress I've made after Party rectification. Now that it has rained, we must lead the sowing well." Production Committee member Li Laigong said: According to the situation in our village, if we want to do a good job in sowing, we must expand mutual aid teams. Bao Chang said: I have red millet seeds, whoever wants to plant them, I will lend them. Branch Secretary Li Degong said that he also has five jin of "cutting bean" seeds that can be adjusted with everyone. Then, he made accurate calculations: the village has 1,430 mu of irrigated and dry land, and 400 mu are left unsown. There are already eight mutual aid teams with 66 laborers. By absorbing some new members, sowing can be completed from the second to the fourth day. To ensure the implementation of the plan, Party members, production committee members, and all cadres took the lead in each group. During the sowing process, new problems were discovered. Some households who did not participate in the mutual aid team lacked labor and livestock and could not plant. That night, the cadres held another meeting to discuss and decided that in the next few days, they should focus on planting and try not to use livestock for grinding flour, so as to free up livestock for planting. The women's director said: We women can organize to grind flour without using livestock. At the meeting, it was also discussed that when livestock were freed up to help households without livestock to plant, it must be ensured that households with livestock were completely willing, and households without livestock should pay two sheng of feed as compensation. Under the correct leadership of the branch, the cadres took the lead actively, the difficulties of the masses were solved, and the sowing task was completed in three days. Now the wheat in the whole village has begun to mature, and the masses are hoeing and leveling the land, and cleaning the threshing ground. (Zanhuang Farmers' Daily)
    [Taihang News] After several meetings and studies, Party members in the First District of Heshun gradually resolved their ideological concerns about being criticized, fearing the extreme democracy of a few people, and fearing that work could not be led. They realized that actively working had a future, and the general mood improved (How were the ideological concerns resolved? How did the mood improve? Please provide a specific account. —Editor). In the past two months, in addition to leading agricultural production, they also seized the gaps in agricultural affairs to organize the masses to engage in sideline occupations, which greatly alleviated the disaster caused by last year's drought. According to statistics from 38 villages, the profit reached over 10 million yuan (冀鈔, same below); among them, 206 people engaged in transportation, with 213 livestock, earning over 2.83 million yuan; 140 people dug medicinal herbs, earning 370,000 yuan; 68 people went to coal mines, earning about 1.67 million yuan; 15 black smoke kilns were operated by 29 people, earning about 3.23 million yuan; 115 people cut wood on the mountains, earning 750,000 yuan; 14 saltpeter factories were operated by 44 people, earning over 100,000 yuan; other picking and cutting (selling, etc.) were done by 251 people, earning over 1.32 million yuan.

　　党员积极领导生产
    赞皇都户村雨后及时下完种
  　和顺一区搞副业赚钱千余万
    【太行讯】赞皇四区都户村党员干部整党后，领导全村群众三天完成下种，并锄苗拉地五十八亩，送粪一千六百担。阴历五月初一日天正下雨，区干部安运更即协同中共支部书记李德功，召集支部党员和全体村干部开会，商量下种工作。党员王金路发言：“过去作工作，别人不叫我干我就看不见，整党后看见了。有一次城内送来一部分复员军人，干部们忙着派饭，我就帮干部找东西，这是整党后进的一点进步。现在下了雨，要好好领导下种。”生产委员李来功说：按咱村情况，要想把下种搞好，就要扩大互助组。保昌说：我有红谷籽种，谁种我借给谁。支书李德功说我还有五斤“割豆”种可以和大家调剂，接着又作了精确的计算：全村水旱地一千四百卅亩，未下种的还剩四百亩，旧有八个互助组、六十六个劳力，再吸收一部分新组员，从初二到初四，可以全部完成下种。为了保证计划的实现，党员、生产委员与全体干部，分头到各组内，起带头作用。在下种过程中发现了新问题，有些没有参加互助组的缺乏劳力畜力的户种不上。当天晚上干部又开会讨论，决定在这几天内以种地为主，估量不用牲口推面，挤出牲口种地。妇女主任说：我们妇女组织起来推面，不用牲口。会上又商量挤出牲口给无牲口户调剂种地时，必须作到有牲口户完全自愿，无牲口户出二升料作为报酬。在支部正确领导下，干部积极带头，群众困难获得解决，下种任务三天全部完成。现在全村麦子已打起头场，群众正在锄苗拉地，清理打场。（赞皇农民报）
    【太行讯】和顺一区党员经过几次会议学习，逐步解决了怕挨整、怕少数群众极端民主、怕工作无法领导等思想顾虑。认识了积极工作就有前途，一般情绪好转（思想顾虑如何解决的？情绪如何好转的？请介绍具体过程。—编者）两月来除领导农业生产外，并随时抓紧农事空隙组织群众搞副业，大大减轻了因去年天旱所造成的灾荒。据三十八个村统计获利达一千余万元（冀钞，下同）；其中搞运输者二百零六人，二百十三头牲口，获利二百八十三万余元；刨下的一百四十人，获利三十七万元；六十八个人下煤窑，获利约一百六十七万元；烧黑烟的窑十五座，参加二十九人，获利约三百二十三万元；砍山一百一十五人，获利七十五万元；开硝厂十四座，参加四十四人，获利十万余元；其他拾砍（贩卖等）二百五十一人，获利一百三十二万余元。
