　　【Taiyue News】Recently, when Puchih Village in Qinshui corrected the "leftist" errors of infringing upon middle peasants, they first selected the first and eighth "lü" (a local administrative unit) as key points. It was discovered that during the winter of last year, 16 middle peasants were wrongly classified during the Farmers' Association rectification. In the cooperative's profit distribution, one middle peasant family should have received 110 jin of sesame cakes, but only received 50 jin. They also collected 50,000 yuan in shares from middle peasants to open a store, but the store was not built, and the money was spent. They also used lumber from middle peasant Jie Xiaobing without paying for it. After understanding these facts, the leadership first reviewed the responsibilities of the higher-level leadership and apologized to the poor and hired peasants, saying that the main reason was the leadership's mistakes last year. At first, some poor and hired peasants were afraid to admit their mistakes and also afraid of retaliation from the middle peasants. After education from the leading comrades and sharing responsibility with them, the poor and hired peasants' attitudes changed, and they were willing to voluntarily apologize to the middle peasants for their mistakes. Poor peasant Han Heidan said, "If there were mistakes in the past, they should be corrected. Apologizing to the middle peasants is not shameful; it is for the sake of unity." Huaizhi said, "In our 'lü,' there are 29 households. Except for two households who are targets of struggle, there are 25 middle peasant households. If we don't unite with the middle peasants, what can we two poor and hired peasant families do?" Following this, the leadership also conducted education among the middle peasants. They reviewed the past leadership's mistakes and expressed their determination to compensate the middle peasants for their losses. At first, the middle peasants were afraid to speak, but after seeing the leaders admit their mistakes, they all spoke out. The shares collected by the mutual aid group in the first "lü" before, those not yet collected would no longer be collected, and the 50,000 yuan already collected, because it was spent on repairing the store, could not be returned immediately. It was decided to continue to build the store and earn the money back to repay. Whether or not to invest would be up to them. No matter who did the work, it would be calculated as investment shares. The lumber used from Tian Xiaobing was also subject to his consent, and calculated as part of the investment. Poor peasant Zhao Huaizhi had wrongly taken the dividends of four middle peasant households in the cooperative and returned them all to them. Once the problem was resolved, the masses' mood immediately changed, and they began production.

　　蒲池退还中农股金
    【太岳消息】沁水蒲池村最近纠正侵犯中农的左倾错误时，先选一、八两闾做重点，发现去年冬天错划成份，农会清洗的中农就有十六人。合作社分红，有一家中农应分麻饼一百一十斤，只给了人家五十斤。他们又向中农集股五万元开店，店房没修成，钱也花光了。用中农介小丙的木料也没给钱。领导上了解了这些材料，首先检讨上级领导上的责任，并向贫雇农检讨说，这主要是去年领导错了。开头几家雇贫只怕承认错误，又怕中农报复；经过领导同志的教育，和他们分担责任，贫雇农的心情也就变过来了，愿自动向中农检讨错误。贫农韩黑旦说：“过去有错就应改，给中农认错并不丢人，这是为了团结。”怀芝说：“咱闾廿九户，除了两家斗争对象，就有二十五家中农。不团结中农，咱两家贫雇能干个啥？”接着，领导上又在中农里进行教育。检讨了过去领导上的错误，表明要坚决补偿中农损失。开始时中农不敢说话，这下看到领导人还认错，都说开了。一闾互助组以前集的股金，未收起的不再收，已收的五万元，因修店房花了，一时还不出，决定继续把店房修成，赚回钱来还。入股不入股听便。不管谁家做的工，都算出来入成股。用田小丙的木料，也征求同意，算在股金里。贫农赵怀芝白抽了合作社四户中农的红利，全部补给了人家。问题一解决，群众情绪马上就变过来，进行生产。
