Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: The Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League has gained the support of the broad masses of young people since its establishment this "May Fourth." The Harbin Municipal League Department held an expanded executive committee meeting on the 7th of this month to review its work over the past month. According to the statistics from this meeting, Harbin now has 48 branch league departments and over 2,000 league members. Many students, teachers, government workers, and young workers and laborers from all walks of life are still requesting to join the League. The Harbin Elementary School Teachers Branch League, with 181 league members, has played a leading role among all 1,300+ elementary school teachers in improving professional skills, uniting colleagues, and leading the Young Pioneers. In universities, colleges, and cadre schools, the Youth League members have also achieved results in promoting learning and guaranteeing the completion of administrative tasks. For example, in the "Respect Teachers and Love the School" movement, they have actively taken the lead in respecting and loving teachers, caring for the school, and engaging in construction labor. League members have also made rapid progress in cultural learning. For example, in the Second Middle School, nine of the model groups elected were led by League members, accounting for two-thirds of the elected groups. In these schools, many teachers have also joined the League, and some have been awarded the title of "Model Teacher" due to their active work after joining. Therefore, the Youth League has a very high reputation in the schools, and young people generally consider it an honor to be a League member. In addition, Youth League members in various factories have also generally demonstrated their enthusiasm in production and learning, playing a promoting role in production and construction. Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, the person in charge of the League, pointed out at the executive committee meeting: "Facts have proven that the organizational form of the Mao Zedong Youth League is very popular among young people. The current task is to push the work of the League further forward. In the future, we must pay more attention to respecting and uniting veteran workers in factories, and promote movements such as 'Respect Teachers and Love the School' in schools." The executive committee also discussed how to improve the League's Literary and Art Academy, weekly lectures, League newspaper, and preparations for summer work.

　　哈市青年团组织壮大
  　有四八个支团部两千余团员
    生产学习中起推动保证作用
    【新华社东北十五日电】哈尔滨市毛泽东青年团，自今年“五四”成立以来，已获得广大青年的拥护。哈市团部于本月七日召开扩大执委会议，检讨一月来的工作。据该会议统计哈市已有四十八个支团部，两千余团员，现在尚有许多学生教员机关工作者，及各业青年工人和青年劳动者要求入团。哈市小学教员分团，有一百八十一名团员，对于改进业务团结同事领导儿童团等工作，在全体一千三百余小学教员中，都起了带头作用。在大中学校及干部学校中，青年团员在推动学习和保证完成行政任务上，也有成绩。如在“尊师爱校”运动中，举凡敬爱老师爱护学校和建设劳动中，都能积极领头去干。团员在文化学习上进步亦快，如第二中学在选举模范小组时，就有九个为团员领导的小组当选，占当选小组的三分之二。在这些学校中也有不少教员入团，由于入团后工作积极已获得“模范教员”称号。故青年团在学校中威信极高，一般青年都以作团员为光荣。此外各工厂的青年团员，在生产和学习中，也普遍表现积极，对生产建设起了推动作用。该团负责人蒋南翔同志在执委会上指出：“事实证明毛泽东青年团的组织形式，甚为广大青年所欢迎。现在的任务就是把团的工作向前推进一步，今后更要在工厂里，注意尊敬和团结老工人，在学校里推动‘尊师爱校’等运动。”执委会并讨论了如何健全该团举办的文艺学园、星期讲座、团报及准备暑期工作等问题。
