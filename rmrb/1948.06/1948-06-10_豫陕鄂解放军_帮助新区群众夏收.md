Xinhua News Agency, Yu, Shaanxi and Hubei Front, 7th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, amidst intense combat and training, has allocated cadres, soldiers, and most of its livestock to help the people in the new areas with the summer harvest day and night. From May 26th, for three days, over 700 people participated, harvesting over 1,630 mu of wheat. When the call for assistance reached the companies, soldiers and cadres proposed: "Don't smoke the old folks' cigarettes, don't eat the villagers' food, don't damage furniture, don't use vulgar language to women, cut cleanly, and cut quickly." Initially, some of the villagers were afraid to let the soldiers help with the cutting, fearing that they would trample the wheat. Some companies, therefore, took sickles in groups and went to the fields to help with the wheat harvest. The soldiers of the headquarters communications squad went to the fields before dawn and finished cutting four mu of wheat. When the landlord, old man, went to the fields in the morning and saw this, he said gratefully, "You are truly the people's army, cutting so cleanly and quickly." He went home and brought out half a catty of white sugar as a reward, but the soldiers politely declined. Old man Hao Zisheng had no livestock to pull the wheat, so a certain unit sent livestock to pull a large cart and transport it back overnight. The old man happily said, "I've lived my whole life and never seen such a good army." An old man bought a few packs of cigarettes and brought them to the fields. He offered them several times, but the soldiers helping with the wheat harvest did not smoke them. An old lady brought a basket of steamed buns to the fields, but the soldiers did not eat them. The old lady repeatedly said, "I steamed these especially for you, I won't feel right until you at least taste one." But the soldiers repeatedly declined, and the old lady took the buns back home.

　　豫陕鄂解放军
  　帮助新区群众夏收
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线七日电】解放军某部，在紧张的作战与整训中，抽出干部战士及大部牲口，昼夜帮助新区群众夏收。五月二十六日起三天内，参加者七百余人，收麦一千六百三十余亩。当助收号召传到连队时，战士干部纷纷提出：“不吸老百姓的烟，不吃老乡的饭，不毁坏家具，对妇女不说粗野话，要割的净，割的快”。开始有的老百姓不敢让战士们帮忙割，害怕践踏坏麦子，有些连队就成班带上镰刀找到地里去帮助割麦。司令部通讯班的战士，天不明就到地里把四亩麦子割完了，天明房东老汉到地里一看，感激的说：“你们真是老百姓的队伍，割的又净，又快”。回家拿出半斤白糖慰劳，战士们婉言谢绝。郝自生老汉没牲口拉麦，某部就派牲口套上大车连夜运回，老汉高兴的说：“活了一辈子，没见过这样好的队伍”。有一老汉买了几包纸烟带到地里，几次拿出来，帮助收割麦子的战士们都没吸，某老太太提了一篮子馒头送到地里，战士们不吃，老太太再三的说：这是我专门给你们蒸的，那怕尝一尝我心里才过得去，战士们还是再三劝解，老太太才把馒头提回家去。
