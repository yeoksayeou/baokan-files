Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. TASS reports: The agricultural economies of the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe have achieved great success, with a significant increase in cultivated land area. Poland has reclaimed 800,000 hectares of wasteland; Bulgaria has increased cultivated land by 200,000 hectares by transforming marshland; Romania alone, through the voluntary labor groups of rural youth, has drained 6,300 hectares of marshland and is now draining another 20,000 hectares. The supply of agricultural machinery in these countries is also continuously increasing. The first domestically manufactured tractors have appeared in the fields of Romania; in Bulgaria, the number of machine tractor stations scattered across the country has increased from 30 to 70; in Hungary, 30 new machine tractor stations have begun work; a canal is being excavated to connect the Danube and Tisza rivers, and an irrigation system capable of irrigating 45,000 Hungarian acres is being built. The movement to establish rural land and livestock cooperatives is expanding and deepening, and large-scale state-owned farms have been established, which, in addition to their own work, greatly help the surrounding villages in cultivation and improvement of farming techniques.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. TASS reports: A recent article in the Soviet Trade Union magazine on the role of trade unions in the new democratic countries points out that the salient features of the trade union movement in the various new democratic countries are its unity, its mass character, and the organization of each trade union according to industrial principles, uniting the vast majority of the working class. Currently, the Czech trade union has more than 3 million members, Poland has 2.8 million, Yugoslavia has 1 million, Romania has 1.4 million, and Hungary has 1.6 million. The achievements of the various new democratic countries in industry should first and foremost be attributed to the selfless labor of the masses of people under the leadership of the working class in the trade unions, which has guaranteed the realization of the economic plans of those countries. The trade unions are also actively participating in consolidating the political, economic, and cultural ties between the working people of the various democratic countries, and trade unions are playing an extremely important role in the struggle of the various people's democratic countries against international reactionaries.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：东欧新民主国家的农业经济已获巨大成就，耕地面积大有增加。波兰已开垦荒地八十万公顷；保加利亚因改造沼泽地而增加耕地二十万公顷；罗马尼亚单是农村青年义务劳动团体就排干了六千三百公顷沼泽地，现在正在排干另外的二万公顷。这些国家的农业机器供应也在不断增加。在罗马尼亚的田野上已出现了第一批本国制造的拖拉机；在保加利亚星罗棋布的机器拖拉机站，已从三十个增加到七十；在匈牙利又有三十个新的机器拖拉机站开始了工作；正在开凿沟通多瑙河与的萨河的运河，并在修筑一条能灌溉四万五千匈亩的灌溉系统，建立农村土地畜牧合作社的运动正在扩大与深入中，大规模的国营农场已经建立，它们在自己的工作之外还大大帮助周围村庄进行耕作与改良耕作技术。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：苏联职工会杂志最近刊载新民主主义国家中职工会的作用一文，作者指出：各新民主主义国家职工运动的显著特点在于它的团结一致，它的群众性以及各职工会按产业组织的原则，它们团结了工人阶级的绝大多数。目前捷克职工会拥有会员三百余万人，波兰拥有二百八十万人，南斯拉夫拥有一百万人，罗马尼亚拥有一百四十万人，匈牙利拥有一百六十万人。各新民主国家工业方面的成就首先应该归功于工人阶级在职工会领导下的人民大众的忘我劳动，使各该国家经济计划的实现得到了保证。职工会并积极参加巩固各民主国家劳动人民间政治经济和文化方面的联系，在各人民民主国家反对国际反动派的斗争中，职工会起着极其重要的作用。
