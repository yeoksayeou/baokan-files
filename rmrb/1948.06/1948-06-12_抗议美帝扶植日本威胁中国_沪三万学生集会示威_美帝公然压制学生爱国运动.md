Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to a TASS Shanghai dispatch on the 5th, citing the North-China Daily News: Thirty thousand middle and university students from various schools in Shanghai held a demonstration rally on June 3rd at the open-air plaza of Jiaotong University to protest the American policy of supporting Japanese aggressive forces and threatening China. Before the meeting, the 30,000 attendees stood to pay tribute to the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives during the eight-year War of Resistance. The newspaper stated: Similar rallies are being held in other cities in the Jiang area. Note: This is the third large-scale demonstration rally held by patriotic students in Shanghai in the past month to protest the reactionary policies of American imperialism towards Japan. The first was on May 4th, and the second was on May 22nd. Both previous rallies had more than 10,000 participants.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to various sources: American imperialist elements have once again openly interfered in the patriotic and democratic student movement in Shanghai, and their lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the support of its masters, is implementing further brutal suppression of the patriotic movement. After officials from the American Embassy and Consulate visited St. John's University, the American authorities of the university, in addition to forcing students to stop the "National Exhibition" (previously mistaken as "Racial Exhibition"), ordered a suspension of classes and the holding of examinations on June 2nd, planning to start the vacation early. Then, they will strictly examine students' ideology and conspire to expel patriotic students in large numbers; two of them have already been expelled. Students at the university have already held a rally to protest this measure and demand that the university authorities retract the order to expel the students. In other news: The American Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, in a speech on May 30th, even said in an insulting tone that "a lot" of the grain eaten by Chinese students was due to the "generosity" of the United States. When students performed a skit at an evening party on May 29th depicting Uncle Sam, covered in American dollar signs, colluding with Japanese financial cliques holding money bags, the principal of the American Youth Night School, Kidd, cut off the electricity, forcing the performance to stop, and submitted a formal written protest to the host of the party. Simultaneously with the oppression by American imperialist elements, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department issued a telegram from the Kuomintang Youth Department on May 21st, prohibiting newspapers and news agencies in the Jiang area from publishing news about the patriotic student movement, only allowing newspapers to publish distorted reports released by the Youth Movement Association under its jurisdiction in various regions. The Kuomintang Central Daily News published an editorial on June 4th, urging university authorities to emulate the fascist oppression of the American authorities at St. John's and clamoring to "eliminate" patriotic students "at the root." Some Kuomintang newspapers in Shanghai shouted "use the army to kill" patriotic students. On May 31st, the Chiang bandits directed secret agent students to destroy the "Current Affairs Cartoon Exhibition" at Shanghai College, tearing up student works, beating and arresting several students (Reuters reported the number of arrests as five, the Associated Press as three). Another student was tragically pushed from the third floor by Chiang's special agents, suffering severe brain and waist injuries. The arrested students will be sent to Chiang's fascist "Special Criminal Court." To intensify the terror and suppression, fascist heads in Shanghai, Wu Guozhen and Xuan Tiewu, held a discussion meeting on June 2nd, where Wu announced various fascist methods for suppressing the student movement, forcing university authorities to accept them.

　　抗议美帝扶植日本威胁中国
  　沪三万学生集会示威
    美帝公然压制学生爱国运动
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社上海五日电引字林西报消息：上海各校大中学生三万人，六月三日在交通大学露天广场上举行抗议美国扶植日本侵略势力威胁中国政策的示威大会。三万到会者，在开会前起立向八年抗战牺牲的数百万军民致哀。该报称：同样性质的大会，正在蒋区其他城市举行。按：此为一个月来上海爱国学生界抗议美帝对日反动政策所举行的第三次大规模示威集会，第一次在五月四日，第二次在五月二十二日。上两次人数均在万人以上。
    【新华社陕北八日电】据各方消息：美国帝国主义分子再度公开干涉上海学生爱国民主运动，而其走狗蒋介石匪帮则在主子支持下，对爱国运动实行进一步的残酷镇压。美国大使馆与领事馆官员访问圣约翰大学之后，该校美国当局除迫令学生停止“民族展览会”（前误为种族展览会）外，复于六月二日下令停课举行考试，拟提前放假，然后将严格检查学生思想，阴谋大批开除爱国学生，其中二人现已开除。对于这一措施，该校学生已经集会抗议，并要求校方收回开除学生的成命。另讯：美国驻沪总领事卡波特在五月三十日演说中，竟以侮辱口吻说：中国学生们所吃的粮食中，“很多”是由于美国的“慷慨”。当学生们在五月二十九日晚会上活报剧演出全身贴满美金标志的山姆大叔与手持钱袋的日阀勾结的丑态时，美国青年夜校校长纪德竟切断电线，迫使停演，并以正式的书面抗议书一件，提交晚会的主持人。与美国帝国主义分子的压迫同时，国民党中宣部于五月三十一日发出国民党青年部五月二十一日的代电，禁止蒋区各报及通讯社刊载学生爱国运动动态，只准各报刊登该部属下各地青运会所发布歪曲事实的消息。国民党中央日报六月四日发表社论，迫促各大学当局应效法圣约翰美国当局的法西斯压迫，叫嚣对爱国学生“斩草除根”。上海若干国民党报纸则大叫“用军队格杀”爱国学生。五月三十一日，蒋匪指使特务学生捣毁上海学院“时事漫画展览会”，将学生作品撕毁，殴伤及逮捕学生多人（逮捕数目，路透社报导为五人，合众社为三人）。另一学生竟惨遭蒋特从三楼推下重伤脑部及腰部，被捕学生将被解往蒋匪法西斯“特种刑事法庭”。沪市法西斯头子吴国桢、宣铁吾等为加紧恐怖镇压，复于六月二日举行谈话会，由吴匪宣布各项压迫学生运动的法西斯办法，强迫各校当局接受。
