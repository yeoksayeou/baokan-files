Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd. Harbin's public enterprises jointly held a celebration rally on the 9th for the past four months of the merit campaign, attended by over a thousand major and minor heroes. The Harbin Construction Bureau awarded over 10 million yuan (Northeast currency) to the heroes. This merit campaign was a broad mass movement, with 80% of the Electricity Bureau's employees (695 people) earning merits. In the trolley factory, 470 out of 588 employees earned merits, and the automobile factory also had 149 people earning merits. At the meeting, Wang Rui, chairman of the Harbin General Trade Union, reviewed the progress of the merit campaign, stating: Since the comprehensive launch of the merit campaign in Harbin's major enterprises on "August 1st," all difficulties have been overcome, production and quality have been improved, and a large number of heroes have emerged. In the Electricity Bureau, workers climbed up electric poles over ten meters high in the severe winter to repair electric wires, persisting in their work even when their noses were frostbitten. They were very careful with materials, even picking up small screws that fell in the snow to reuse. Thanks to the efforts of all employees of the Electricity Bureau, not only was ×× million kilowatts of electricity generated, but the loss rate was reduced by 13% compared to the puppet Manchukuo era. In terms of lines, they repaired 22,000 [unit unknown, possibly meters or feet] of "two-wan" transmission lines (a type of alloy wire) and completed ten kilowatt or more transformers. The trolley factory rushed out three cars in April and created a type of insulating oil. The factory's employees voluntarily established a monthly "Support the Army" day. During "Support the Army" days, the workers worked up to ten or even twelve hours or more. Young worker Sun Jixiang automatically worked for two days and two nights without sleep to complete an urgent car repair task. Thanks to everyone's careful maintenance, the life of the motors has been extended; in the past, they had to be repaired every ten days, but now they can be used for over seventy days. The water plant also completed gas and water production during the merit campaign and increased water delivery to over 17,000 tons. After praising the above outstanding achievements, Comrade Wang Zhi pointed out that production should be further increased to welcome the All Liberated Areas Workers' Congress; and implement a policy of considering both public and private interests, and widely promote piece-rate wages and progressive reward methods. He hoped that the heroes would return to their factories and take the lead in leading the masses to earn more merits. Director Ding of the Harbin First Construction Bureau also attended the meeting and spoke, pointing out that the meeting had two characteristics: first, the combination of individual and collective merit-making; and second, the combination of labor enthusiasm and technology. He called on the people to further develop the spirit of collective merit-making and earn more and greater merits. He hoped that technicians and young workers would unite more closely in the future and properly launch the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" movement. He also called on everyone to combine scientific knowledge and labor technology, unite all mental workers, and take on the heavy responsibility of supporting the war and completing construction. Finally, Liu Yingcan, an old hero of the power plant, delivered a reply on behalf of the heroes. He called on the heroes to replan production well after returning to the factory, treat the factory as their own home with a sense of ownership, work hard, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. At the end of the meeting, each factory put forward challenges and accepted challenges based on its specific situation, and the young workers of the Mao Zedong Youth League were particularly active in the competition.
