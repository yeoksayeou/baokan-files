[Taihang News] Local armed forces in Xinxiang, Huixian, Jixian and other counties in northern Henan Province have been actively striking out, penetrating deep behind enemy lines in the struggle to protect wheat and grain, and have successively created exemplary war records of annihilating small groups of enemies and destroying puppet organizations. At the end of last month, our Xinxiang First and Fifth District Work Teams, in coordination with the Huixian Brigade, penetrated Xinzhuang, more than ten miles away from Xinxiang City. After a half-hour battle, they completely annihilated the Wangling Township Government's garrison, killing two enemy squad leaders, Bian Shouren and others, wounding two enemies, and capturing 18 people including puppet Deputy Township Chief Guo Jiachen. They seized 21 long and short guns, one submachine gun, and four rifle grenades, without any casualties on our side. On the 4th of this month, a part of our Xinxiang Brigade, combined with the Huixian Fifth District and Jixian Third District Work Teams and District Cadre Teams, ambushed at Baimushan between Xinxiang Hetun on the Pinghan Branch Line. When the enemy's Xinxiang Police Station's engineering team of more than 100 people, with seven machine guns and six small cannons, entered our ambush circle, our ambushers rose up and charged. In addition to killing and wounding some, they captured 40 enemies alive, seizing three machine guns, one small mortar, sixteen rifles, and more than 1,250 rounds of ammunition. Furthermore, our Jixian Third District District Cadre Team and Work Team, in coordination with a part of the battalion's soldiers, carried out activities deep in the Balitun area on the 10th. Near Tangzhuang, they discovered more than 40 armed personnel of the enemy's Shanbiao Township Government. We immediately surrounded the enemy. After an hour of fighting, we killed seven enemies including Li Zuolin, the captain of the Shanbiao Township Government, captured one alive, and seized 12 long and short guns.
