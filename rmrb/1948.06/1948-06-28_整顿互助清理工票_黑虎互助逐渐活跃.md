　　Rectifying Mutual Aid by Clearing Work Points
  　Black Tiger Mutual Aid Gradually Becomes Active
    [Taihang News] During the initial rectification of mutual aid in Black Tiger Village, District Seven of Pingshun, it was discovered that everyone disliked work points and was not enthusiastic about mutual benefit and labor exchange. After in-depth investigation, it turned out that during the large-scale labor exchange in the spring mutual aid campaign, the group leader (a new middle peasant who was a poor peasant not long ago), Xu Zhubao, lost 600 work points when collecting them. District cadres, in order to take care of the turned-over households, forced the entire village to compensate him. It was said that this was because Zhubao could not afford to pay for it himself. Although the masses did not openly object at the time, they were actually very dissatisfied. Some people said that work points were nothing and that it didn't matter if they were lost; others deliberately said that they had lost their work points to see what the cadres would do. When it came to settling the spring sowing wages, the cadres asked the masses to hand in their work points, but they couldn't collect them all for half a month. This one said they had dropped them, that one said they had dropped them, and asked the village cadres to find a solution. The village cadres were at a loss and put the problem aside. Discovering this problem this time, a mass meeting of the entire village was convened on the 6th of this month to discuss it. Many people said, "Work points are as valuable as Jinnan currency; whoever loses them must compensate for them." Zhubao also felt that he was wrong and compensated for them himself. As a result, the cadres collected all the work points from the entire village within a day. Once the accounts were cleared, the masses' interest in work points immediately increased, and they all competed to earn work points. Supporting substitute cultivation came without being dispatched automatically. Mutual aid and labor exchange also became active. On the 10th of this month, the district issued an urgent notice requiring twenty-two livestock to transport public grain to Changzhi. The cadres were very worried at first, fearing that they wouldn't be able to dispatch so many, and prepared to issue an order. Because in the past, even dispatching two livestock required doing so. Who could have imagined that as soon as the announcement for livestock was made, thirty-two heads immediately came, exceeding the requirement by ten. The village chief was extremely happy and said to everyone, "We don't need so many. Those who want to go back can go back, and we'll ask again if there's a shortage." But no one wanted to go back. Only after patient explanation were ten heads returned. (Ma Xiusheng, Liang Jiansheng)

　　整顿互助清理工票
  　黑虎互助逐渐活跃
    【太行讯】平顺七区黑虎村在最初整顿互助中，发现大家对工票都很讨厌，对互利变工都不积极。经过深入检查，原来去春闹互助大变工，小组长（新中农，不久前曾是贫农）徐住保在收工票时，丢失了六百分，区干部为照顾翻身户，硬叫全村群众替他赔出来。据说：这是因为住保一个人赔不起。当时群众虽未公开反对，其实很不满意。有人说工票不算什么，丢了也不要紧；有人就故意说自己丢了工票，看干部怎么办。到结算春季下种工资时，干部向群众收工票，半个月也收不起来。这个说掉了，那个也说掉了，请村干给想办法。弄得村干也没了主意，把问题搁置起来。这次发现了这一问题，便于本月六日召开全村群众大会讨论。许多人说：“工票顶冀南票用哩，谁掉了谁赔。”住保也觉得自己不对，就自己赔了出来。于是干部一天内就把全村工票收齐了。帐目算清，群众对工票的兴趣马上提高，又都争着赚工票。支取代耕，不用派就自动来了。互助变工也随着活跃起来。本月十日，区里紧急通知，要二十二个牲口往长治送公粮。干部开始很发愁，怕派不出这样多，准备下命令。因为过去就是派两个牲口也得这么作。谁能这次一广播要牲口，马上就来了三十二头，超过十头。村长高兴得了不得，对大家说：“用不了这么多，愿回去的可以回去，再有了差再去吧。”但谁也不愿回去。后经耐心解释，才退回去十头。　　　（马秀生、梁建胜）
