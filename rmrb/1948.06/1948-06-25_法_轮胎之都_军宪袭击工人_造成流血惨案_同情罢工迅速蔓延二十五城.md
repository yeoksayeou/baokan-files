Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Reports from various sources: A bloody incident occurred on the 15th in Clermont-Ferrand, a city in central France also known as the "Tyre Capital," when military police attacked workers, sparking widespread and strong sympathetic strikes and demonstrations across France.

Workers at the Baguenault Rubber Factory in Clermont-Ferrand held a sit-down strike several days ago because the manufacturer refused to negotiate on the issue of wage increases. On the night of the 15th, the reactionary local government suddenly decided to expel the workers from the factory, dispatching a large number of military police to carry out the eviction order, occupy the entire factory, and violently beat and arrest striking workers, which aroused the strikers' indignation and fierce resistance. According to local officials afterward, thirteen workers were injured in the violence (Associated Press reported that many were seriously injured), and sixty-five workers were arrested. Not only that, but the Schuman government is also attempting further suppression of the workers in Clermont-Ferrand. The Associated Press reported that police and troops were being sent to Clermont-Ferrand by trucks, planes, and trains all night on the 16th, and there are now five regiments of troops stationed there.

After the bloody incident, a sympathy general strike broke out throughout Clermont-Ferrand. Workers at the Michelin tire factory also occupied the factory. The Saint-Eloy mine near the city was also completely on strike, and the miners rushed to Clermont-Ferrand to help their striking comrades. The snowballing sympathetic strikes quickly spread to more than twenty-five cities, including Marseille (on the Mediterranean coast, France's largest port), Belfort (eastern France, near Switzerland), Metz (northeastern France, near Luxembourg), Strasbourg (northeastern France, close to Germany), and Saint-Étienne (southwest of Lyon). The Associated Press reported that at least 50,000 people were on strike on the 16th, and another 100,000 workers would leave work on the 17th.

On the evening of the 17th, the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) called on all workers, civil servants, railway employees, and public utility workers to hold a one-hour general strike on the 19th (11:00 AM to 12:00 PM) to "demonstrate their solidarity with the workers of the department of Allier (Clermont-Ferrand is located in this department) and their determination to end police attacks and government provocations" (Associated Press), and the CGT also called on its affiliated unions to demand the release of the arrested workers in Clermont-Ferrand and to demand the exchange of Interior Minister Moch, "the murderer who has repeatedly massacred workers" (Agence France-Presse).

On the 16th, Mr. Bisset, a member of the French Communist Party in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, questioned the government in the National Assembly about the bloody incident. Communist Party members Schmitt and Videlin successively and forcefully criticized the government's reactionary policies. Communist Party members also demanded that the National Assembly immediately discuss the Clermont-Ferrand incident.

    十七日晚，法国总工会号召全体工人、公务员、铁路员工、公用事业工人于十九日总罢工一小时（上午十一时至十二时），以“表现他们与多那省（克勒蒙腓隆城即在该省）工人要团结及结束警察侵袭与政府挑拨的决心”（合众社）及总工会并号召所属工会要求释放克勒蒙腓隆被捕之工人，要求对换“屡次屠杀工人的杀人犯”内政部长摩许（法新社）。
