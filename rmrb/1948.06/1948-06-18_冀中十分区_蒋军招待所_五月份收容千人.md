The Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei "Chiang Army Reception Center"
	Receives 1,000 People in May
　　[Dispatch from Central Hebei, 15th] In areas north of the Daqing River and elsewhere, the number of Chiang bandits deserting due to war-weariness and defecting to our army is increasing daily. According to statistics from the Tenth Sub-district's "Chiang Army Veteran Reception Center," in the month of May alone, it received 1,015 defecting and deserting Chiang puppet soldiers, averaging more than 30 per day; they also brought with them 28 rifles and 1 pistol, exceeding the total number of defections and desertions in the previous four months. Zhang Jinduo and others, who deserted with their weapons from Wang Bandit Fenggang's 14th Regiment (now reorganized as the 2nd Regiment), said, "We suffered a defeat at Kaikou. After returning, Wang Xia (deputy regimental commander) bought three packs of cigarettes, distributed them to everyone, and said: 'Everyone, put more effort into fighting in the future! Keep at it! There is hope.' The soldiers secretly said: 'Putting more effort in only means there is hope of dying.'" Zhang Ju, who deserted with his weapon from the 3rd Regiment of Hua (Hua Guanqun's regiment), said, "Our captain said: 'Don't call it the 3rd Regiment of Hua anymore! If we keep calling it that, we'll be turned into Eighth Route Army soldiers and disappear. Let's call it the 3rd Regiment of Running Away!' (Because they run away as soon as they hear that the People's Liberation Army is coming). 'If there is a situation, we run. If we can't run, we surrender our guns. If we surrender our guns, we won't die.'" Now, these defecting Chiang puppet soldiers, after being warmly received by the democratic government, are either assigned jobs or given travel expenses to return home, according to their own wishes.

　　冀中十分区“蒋军招待所”
  　五月份收容千人
    【冀中十五日电】大清河北等地，蒋匪厌战逃亡及投诚我军者日增。据十分区“蒋军退伍招待所”统计，在五月份一个月内即收容投诚及逃亡之蒋伪军一千零十五名，平均每天达三十余名；并带出步枪廿八支，手枪一支，超过已往四个月投诚逃亡的总数。王匪凤岗十四团（现改成二团）携枪逃亡的张金铎等说：“我们在开口打了败仗，回去后王霞（副团长）买了三条烟，分给大家吸，并说：大家以后打仗上劲干吧！干吧！有希望。士兵们背地里都说：净上劲了，有死的希望。”华三团（华冠群团）携枪逃来的张局说：“我们队长说：往后别叫华三团啦！再叫就着八路军化没了，叫跑三团吧！”（因为听到解放军一去就跑）。“一个有情况我们就跑，跑不了就缴枪，缴枪就死不了。”现在这些投诚的蒋伪军，经民主政府热情招待后，根据他们的自愿，有的参加工作，有的发给路费回了家。
