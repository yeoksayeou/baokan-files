　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th. Our local army corps in central Shanxi has achieved another victory in the struggle to protect wheat, killing and capturing over 700 enemy soldiers including the enemy division commander. After ten regiments of Yan's army were defeated by our forces in the Liangjiazhuang area west of Xiaoyi on the 14th, the entire 70th Division of Yan's army from Fenyang and a battalion of local troops (replenishment training regiment), led by bandit division commander Hou Fujun, advanced towards Niujia Yuan and Shanzhuang Tou southwest of Wenshui. A unit of our local army corps bravely resisted, and after six hours of fierce fighting, completely routed the enemy. The division commander Hou Fujun was killed on the spot, and the division chief of staff, Liu Chengji, was also seriously wounded and died. In this battle, we also captured the director of the 70th Division's press office, Bian Peilin, the deputy commander of the 201st Regiment, Wang Kuizhi, and 561 other enemies, killing and wounding a total of over 200 enemies. We seized one mountain gun, two mortars, two infantry guns, fifteen light guns, forty-six light and heavy machine guns, over 270 long and short guns, as well as other ammunition, mules, horses, and military supplies. The Jin-Sui Military Region Headquarters commended the unit for repeatedly achieving victories with fewer troops, flexibly annihilating the enemy, and protecting the masses' wheat harvest, and issued a special order of commendation.
