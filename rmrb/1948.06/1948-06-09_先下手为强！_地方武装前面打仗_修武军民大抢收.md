　　“The best defense is a good offense!”
　　Local armed forces fight in the front
　　Xiuwu military and civilians rush to harvest
    [Taihang News] The struggle to protect wheat on the border of northern Henan is becoming increasingly tense. Under the strong protection of local armed forces and militias, Xiuwu County fully launched a large-scale rush harvest in late May. According to statistics from thirteen villages in the first and third districts, more than 7,300 mu of wheat were harvested in four days; the villages of Shaqiang and Chizhuang have completed the rush harvest and are now hiding the harvest as they fight. A certain battalion of our Xiuwu Regiment repelled the enemy's invasion from Wang twice in Zhanggong in three days from May 25th to 27th, and helped the families of military martyrs, cadres, and widowed and orphaned people in Yizhuang, Zhang Tianhe and other villages to rush to harvest. Comrade Miao Tietou of the East Joint Defense in the first district led a work team combined with a part of the militia rotation team to conduct political offensives in villages near enemy strongholds and areas awaiting the arrival of Wang, day and night. In three days, the pseudo-self-defense forces of several villages automatically surrendered 19 dart guns. The district cadre team of the fourth district and the Lingchuan militia rotation team and work team supporting the border areas actively advanced to Dazhang, Fenghuang Temple and other places on the night of May 28th in four routes to set up ambushes. The enemy was killed and wounded by our mines, and 13 were killed and wounded by cold shots. One enemy was captured alive. We captured one rifle. The enemy did not snatch a single grain of wheat and fled in panic. On the same day, the pseudo-prefectural commissioner's armed forces, together with the pseudo-Xiuwu security regiment and the Liu Jiangying pseudo-self-defense force, totaling more than 500 people, rushed to harvest wheat in Wuliyuan area of our second district. They were blocked by mines and cold shots by a certain battalion of our Xiuwu Regiment and the work team of the second district. The enemy suffered six casualties and retreated to Banqiao. Under the cover of our armed forces' active attacks, the East Joint Defense of the first district rushed to harvest more than 3,000 mu of wheat in three days from the 25th to the 27th of last month; half of the villages had harvested half of the wheat, and the remaining three villages had harvested one-third, and one village had harvested one-quarter.
    When mobilizing for the rush harvest, the village chief of Zhang Tianhe Village in the first district first enlightened the masses to recall the miserable life of fleeing famine and the last time they were swept away by the Chiang bandits, which aroused everyone's enthusiasm for rushing to harvest wheat and fighting the enemy, broke the paralysis and waiting mentality, and loudly put forward the slogan of "the best defense is a good offense." Then, under his lead in rushing to harvest, he further promoted the rush harvest in the whole village. In three days, in addition to completing half of the wheat harvest, part of the grain has been transferred to the back mountain. The production director of Maozhai created a method of pulling wheat with wheels (putting two rakes on the wheels), which can pull five to seven bundles at a time, equivalent to five or six laborers carrying the load; now there are nine wheels pulling wheat in the village, saving eighteen labor days every day. In order to achieve simultaneous harvesting, fighting, and hiding, the masses of Wangzhang Village jointly studied and came up with a method of spreading wheat bran in the place where the wheat is stored, overcoming the difficulty of "fear of rotting." The 3,100 mu of wheat in Shaqiang and Chizhuang villages in the third district have all been harvested, and are now being hidden as they fight. Their experience is: (1) Mobilize men, women, old and young to work together, and carry out surprise attacks day and night. (2) Village cadres go deep into the mutual aid groups to take the lead in person, and carry out wheat protection in a planned manner. Chizhuang harvests in the fields as soon as it is light, harvests in the morning and hides in the afternoon, fights in the afternoon and hides at night, and at the same time harvests one piece, fights one piece, and hides one piece separately, and there is no wheat stored in the field. Xijian Village in the third district has harvested more than 400 mu and threshed more than 100 shi of wheat. According to local estimates, the Shenguo and Xijian Joint Defense can complete the harvest, threshing, and storage by the end of May.

　　“先下手为强！”
  　地方武装前面打仗
  　修武军民大抢收
    【太行消息】豫北边地保麦斗争日形紧张，修武全县在地方武装与民兵有力保卫下，五月下旬已展开了大抢收。据一、三区十三村统计，四天内即割麦七千三百多亩；沙墙、赤庄等村已抢收完结，现正随打随藏。我修武团某大队在五月二十五日至二十七日的三天中，于张弓两次打退由王出犯抢麦之敌，并在义庄、张天河等村，帮助军干烈属、孤寡群众抢收。一区东联防苗铁头同志带领的武工队，结合民兵轮战队一部，日夜深入敌据点待王附近各村开展政攻。三天内，数村伪自卫团自动缴出镖枪十九支。四区区干队及支援边地的陵川民兵轮战队、武工队，五月二十八日夜分四路主动进到大掌，凤凰寺等地设伏，敌被我地雷炸死伤四名，冷枪打死伤十三名，活捉一名，我缴获步枪一支，敌未抢上一粒麦子，狼狈逃回。同日，伪专署武装配合伪修武保安团及刘江营伪自卫队共五百余人，向我二区五里源一带抢麦，被我修武团某大队与二区武工队用地雷、冷枪阻击，敌伤亡六名，退回板桥。在我武装主动出击掩护下，一区东联防，上月二十五至二十七日三天内，抢收麦子三千多亩；并有半数村庄抢收了一半，其余三个村亦抢收了三分之一，一个村抢收四分之一。
    一区张天河村长在动员抢收时，先启发群众回忆逃荒和上次被蒋匪一扫光后的凄惨生活，激起了大家抢麦与对敌斗争积极性，打破了麻痹等待思想，响亮提出“先下手为强”的口号，接着在他先动手抢割下，进一步推动了全村抢收，三天除完成割麦一半外，并将粮食一部已转移到后山。毛寨生产主任创造了用轮（轮上放上两盘耙）拉麦办法，一次可拉五捆到七捆，顶五六个劳力担；现该村有九个轮拉麦，每天省劳力工十八个。王张村群众为做到随收随打随藏，共同研究出藏麦地方铺麦糠，克服了“怕烂”困难。三区沙墙、赤庄两村的三千一百多亩麦子，已全部抢收完，现正随打随藏。他们的经验是：（一）男女老少齐动员，日夜突击。（二）村干部深入各互助组亲自带头，并有计划的进行保麦。赤庄是一明就上地割，上午打下午藏，下午打黑夜藏，同时是收一块、打一块、分散藏一块，场上不存麦。三区西间村已抢收四百多亩，打麦一百多石。据当地估计，申国、西间两联防，五月底左右即可收打藏完。
