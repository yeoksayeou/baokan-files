Furthermore, according to a report from the French sector of West Berlin: Hoffmann, Chairman of the Thuringia Province Socialist Unity Party, commented on the results of the signature campaign on the 14th, stating: "The people's will has been expressed so clearly that the signing is, in fact, a plebiscite." He also stated: "Even if the entire parliament has not yet been able to recognize this unified petition, this petition is legitimate for every German."
