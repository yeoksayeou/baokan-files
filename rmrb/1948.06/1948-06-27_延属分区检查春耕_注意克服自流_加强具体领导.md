Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: The Yan'an Prefecture (延属分区) (administering Yan'an, Zichang, Ganquan, Fu County ＠县, Zhidan, Ansai, Yanchuan, and Yanchang counties) of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region convened a joint meeting of county party secretaries and county magistrates in late May to review the spring plowing work in each county. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary, and Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Border Government, personally attended and provided guidance, calling on everyone to attach importance to production leadership, and clearly pointed out that restoring production this year is the basis for doing all work well. According to preliminary checks, the prefecture has achieved significant results in spring plowing this year, but there is still a serious phenomenon of spontaneity. The pre-war cultivated land area of the prefecture was more than 4,090,000 mu. According to incomplete statistics, the current cultivated land totals more than 3,700,000 mu, that is, 85 percent of the pre-war cultivated land has been restored. Due to more spring rain in each county, the crops in sunny areas and river valleys are better. Due to the impact of the war, the wheat sown last winter was cultivated coarsely, and the harvest this year is average; in addition to foxtail millet in the autumn fields, other beans, hemp, corn, and early millet have all sprouted. In mid-May, the climate turned cold for a time, and some of the autumn fields in Zhidan (formerly Bao'an County), Ganquan, and the Reclamation Area (a newly established special zone equivalent to a county in the southeast of Yan'an, around Nanniwan and Jinpenwan) were damaged by frost and need to be replanted with late-maturing cold-resistant crops such as foxtail millet. In addition, the entire prefecture has resettled 7,450 immigrant households, totaling 27,639 people. This not only alleviates the severity of the disaster in other disaster-stricken areas, but also enhances the prefecture's labor force. There are also many places where women and children are mobilized to participate in agricultural labor. Ansai County has the best production performance among the counties. According to the inspection on April 26, the county planted a total of 52,807 hectares of land, adjusted 464 dan of grain, and solved the grain problem for 9,077 people; adjusted more than 65,000 jin of seeds, more than 3,000 pieces of agricultural implements, and 6,320 hectares of land, thus stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for production. The main reason why the county achieved the above results is that the leadership systematically overcame the laissez-faire and fear of difficulties among cadres at all levels and carried out concrete leadership of production. Yanchuan and Zhidan counties have also made achievements in adjusting seeds and food, seizing the agricultural season, and resettling immigrants and refugees. However, Yanchang and Gulin counties have poorer production because the leadership has not combined combat and production well; Zichang (formerly Anding County) lacks planning and focus in spring plowing and disaster relief, and although they are busy all day long, they have still failed to complete the task. Looking at the entire prefecture, although many achievements have been made, production in most areas is still in a state of spontaneity. Cadres are afraid of difficulties and fail to rely on the masses to carry out concrete leadership, but only complain to the higher authorities. Cadres in Ganquan, the Reclamation Area, and Yanchang and other places believe that resettling immigrants and refugees is adding trouble to themselves, and there are undesirable phenomena such as xenophobia, indifference, and procrastination. Yanchang and other places have not resolutely corrected the deviations in the land reform, which affects the peasants' production enthusiasm; there are also phenomena such as insufficient attention to the instructions of the Prefectural Party Committee and the Commissioner's Office. At the joint meeting, Commissioner Li Jinglin made awards and criticisms based on the merits of each county, and pointed out the methods for future production work: (1) Rush to plant small-season crops (late-maturing cold-resistant crops) and buckwheat to make up for the autumn fields that have been damaged by frost. (2) Actively organize the summer harvest and solve the difficulties of tools such as sickles as soon as possible. (3) Carry out summer cultivation and organize more voluntary mutual-aid teams. (4) Prepare to resettle another 1,300 immigrants and refugees, and all localities should discuss specific methods to solve the accommodation and production of immigrants. Establish eleven immigrant stations to receive passing immigrants. (5) Rural diseases are prevalent, and cadres should first learn simple hygiene knowledge and educate the masses on prevention and treatment. Commissioner Li also called on county leaders to personally take action, conduct concrete leadership, gain experience, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

　　延属分区检查春耕
  　注意克服自流
  　加强具体领导
    【新华社西北二十二日电】陕甘宁边区延属分区（辖延安、子长、甘泉、＠县、志丹、安塞、延川、延长等县）于五月下旬召集县委书记、县长联席会议，检讨各县春耕工作。中共西北中央局书记习仲勋、副书记马明芳，边府副主席杨明轩等均亲自出席指导，号召大家重视生产领导，明确指出今年恢复生产是做好一切工作的基础。根据初步检查，该分区今年春耕已获得重大成绩，但仍存在着严重的自流现象。该分区战前耕地面积共有四百零九万余亩，据不完全统计，现在种地共计三百七十余万亩，即已恢复战前耕地的百分之八十五。各县由于春雨较多，向阳地及川地庄稼较好。去冬种麦因受战争影响，耕耘较粗糙，今年收成平常；秋田除麋子外，其他豆、麻、玉蜀黍，早谷已全部出苗。五月中旬气候一度转寒，志丹（原保安县）、甘泉、垦区（延安东南南泥湾、金盆湾一带新设特区，等于县）部分秋田遭冻，须重新翻种糜谷等晚熟耐寒作物。此外全分区还安置了七千四百五十户移民，共计两万七千六百三十九人这不但减轻了其他灾重地区灾情的严重程度，且使延属分区增强了一批劳动生力军。发动妇女儿童等参加农业劳动的地方也不少。各县生产成绩以安塞较好。据四月二十六日的检查，全县共种地五二八○七垧，调剂了粮食四百六十四石，解决了九、○七七人口粮；调剂出籽种六万五千余斤，农具三千余件，土地六千三百二十垧，因此激起群众生产热潮。该县获得上述成绩，主要原因是领导上有计划地克服了各级干部放任自流和畏惧困难的思想，进行了对生产的具体领导。延川、志丹等县在调剂种籽吃粮，抓紧农时及安置移难民等方面亦均有成绩。但延长、固临则因领导上未使战斗与生产很好结合，生产较差；子长（原安定县）春耕和救灾缺乏计划和中心，虽整日忙碌，仍未能完成任务。总观全区，虽然得到了许多成绩，但大部地区生产，仍处于自流状态，干部畏惧困难，未能依靠群众进行具体领导，而只向上级诉苦。甘泉、垦区、延长等地干部认为安置移难民，是给自己增加麻烦，发生不应有的排外、不理、推拖等现象。延长等地没有坚决纠正土改中的偏向，影响着农民的生产情绪；对地委、专署指示，还有不够重视等现象。联席会上，根据各县成绩优劣，李景林专员进行了奖励与批评，并指出今后生产工作的办法：（一）抢种小日月庄稼（晚熟耐寒作物）及荞麦等以补遭冻灾的秋田。（二）积极组织夏收，及早解决镰刀等工具困难。（三）开展夏耘，多组织自愿结合的变工、扎工队。（四）准备再安置一千三百移难民，对移民之住处及生产，各地应商讨具体办法予以解决。成立十一处移民站，招待过往移民。（五）农村疾病流行，干部应首先学会简单卫生常识，并教育群众预防和治疗。李专员并号召县领导人要亲自动手，进行具体领导，取得经验，开展批评与自我批评。
