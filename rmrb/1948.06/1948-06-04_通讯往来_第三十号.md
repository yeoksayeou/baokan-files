　　Correspondence No. 30
    To all branch offices, joint offices of counties in the border areas, and comrades of the correspondents:
    Recently, various counties in the border areas of the second, fourth, and fifth districts of Taihang have reported actively preparing to defend the wheat harvest and the victorious war of protecting the wheat. This is very good. Please continue to report based on the wheat protection instructions published in today's newspaper, paying attention to the following points: (1) How to launch a broad mass-based guerrilla war to protect the wheat, combining labor and military affairs, striving for complete initiative, and forcing the enemy into points and lines. How our armed forces can actively operate, take the initiative to attack, combine with the mass explosion movement, strengthen joint defense operations, support each other, and strive for victory in various large and small battles. (2) How to mobilize and organize the masses of all classes to quickly harvest, quickly fight, and quickly hide, ensuring that the enemy does not steal a single grain of wheat. (3) How to take necessary economic measures, strengthen the political offensive against the enemy, and use various effective specific methods to smash the enemy's various deceptive propaganda and plundering conspiracies.
    To the border counties of the Taiyue District: What is the situation of your wheat protection struggle? Please report quickly.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　General Branch Office
