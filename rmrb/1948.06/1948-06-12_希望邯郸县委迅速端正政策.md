　　Hoping the Handan County Committee Will Quickly Correct its Policies

　　The rectification work in Su Cao and other villages in Handan County has not made any progress so far, and various deviations are still developing seriously. The most alarming thing is that these phenomena are emerging one after another in Su Cao Village, where the Handan County Committee is stationed, but the leaders of the county are turning a blind eye to it. This fully proves that bureaucracy can kill people! The reason why the Handan County Committee is like this is first, they have forgotten what Chairman Mao taught: "Determining the work policy according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all communists must firmly remember." The Handan County Committee does not even look at the "masses' voices" about the county published in the newspaper. They do not know which village, who, and when Li Zhuang's militia hanged himself, and the Second District coaxed the village cadres' wheat. They are so unconcerned and unfamiliar with the voices of the masses and the situation of the cadres, so how can we talk about implementing the party's correct policies?

　　Secondly, it is the liberal attitude towards the implementation of the Party's policies. We believe that the Handan County Committee is not overcoming difficulties in implementing policies, but is not resolutely implementing them, so they do not know the difficulties and mistakes. For example, regarding the estimation of "left" and right in Handan's work, they say that "I am afraid that incompleteness is the main thing." This is not the result of the county leaders' true understanding and analysis of the situation, but is subjectively used as a shield to resist the rectification work. We certainly cannot determine whether it is "left" or right for the whole county, but the deviations of not compensating the middle peasants, not resettling landlords and rich peasants, and the chaotic anarchy in Su Cao and Liu Erzhuang are obvious facts and should be corrected first. At present, some places in the whole region are carrying out rectification work and have made great achievements, but there are also many places that have an attitude similar to that of the Handan County Committee towards Su Cao Village. They still do not understand the situation at the grassroots level, do not study policies, correct mistakes, or improve their work, and objectively form resistance to the Party's rectification policies. Some even say that the masses' thinking cannot be reached, and that lower-level cadres are resisting, but in fact these are all problems of leadership style and thinking. We ask the Handan County Committee to seriously understand the situation. If the reporter's understanding of the situation is incorrect, we can also discuss it together, all for the purpose of quickly correcting policies and improving our work.

### 希望邯郸县委迅速端正政策

　　希望邯郸县委迅速端正政策
    邯郸县苏曹等村纠偏工作，至今尚无一点眉目，而且各种偏向还在严重发展。最可惊的，是这些现象，一桩桩的在该县县委机关驻地的苏曹村层出不穷，而该县领导上竟熟视无睹，这十足的证明了官僚主义害死人！邯郸县县委其所以如此，第一是他们忘记了毛主席所教导的话：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法”。邯郸县委对报载有关该县的“群众呼声”，竟不看一看，李庄民兵上了吊，二区哄了村干部的麦子，他们竟不知道是何村，何人与何时。对群众呼声与干部情况是这样的不关心，不熟悉，请问贯彻党的正确政策又何从谈起？
    其次，是执行党的政策的自由主义态度，我们觉得邯郸县委不是在执行政策中克服困难，而是不坚决执行，因而也就不知道困难和错误之所在。比如对邯郸工作“左”与右的估计，说是“恐怕不彻底是主要的”，这并不是该县领导上真实了解与分析情况的结果，而是主观的拿来作为抵抗纠偏工作的挡箭牌，就全县来说究竟是“左”还是右，我们当然无法判定，但苏曹、刘二庄的不补偿中农，不安置地富，乱轰轰的无政府状态等偏向，是很明显的事实，是应该首先纠正的。目前全区，有的地方正在进行纠偏工作，作得很有成绩，但也有不少地方与邯郸县委对苏曹村的态度差不多，至今仍然不了解下情，不研究政策，纠正错误，改进工作，客观上形成对党的纠偏政策的抵抗。甚至说是群众思想打不通，说下级干部抵抗，其实都是领导作风和思想上的问题，我们要求邯郸县委认真了解情况，如果记者了解情况不对还可以共同商讨，一切为了迅速端正政策改进我们的工作。
