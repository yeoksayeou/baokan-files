　　France Launches New Wage Increase Campaign
  　Czech Communist Party Membership Exceeds Two Million
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] Paris dispatch: To oppose the Schumann authorities' betrayal of their promise to maintain a constant balance between wages and prices, the French working class is launching a new wage increase campaign. General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), Frachon, announced at the National Congress of the Government Employees' Union on the 14th: We will soon remind the government of this promise and the date it set. On June 1st, we, representing the working class, will demand the restoration of the balance between wages and prices that existed before 1947. The June 1st mentioned here is the date the French government promised to increase wages. Following this, the secretariat of the CGT received a letter from the secretariat of the Christian Labor Confederation, suggesting that the CGT take joint action with them to defend the workers' demands. This suggestion has now been accepted by the CGT. In a reply on the 20th, the CGT secretariat proposed: "The basic demands submitted to the government should include a 20% wage increase, increased pensions and allowances, and automatic wage increases when prices rise by 10%." The publication of the above news is a final ultimatum to the French government. The panicked Schumann cabinet is plotting to paralyze the French working class's imminent struggle for wage increases. An Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 20th revealed: "Well-informed sources assert that in order to avoid complicating the already chaotic political situation, the French government has decided to increase the wages of all workers in France by 8 to 10 percent starting from June 1st." On the 22nd, Schumann himself issued a statement announcing that the bread ration would be increased from 200 grams to 250 grams (approximately half a Chinese jin), but he did not specify from what date this would be implemented.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] According to Agence France-Presse, citing materials from the Czech Communist Party's *Rude Pravo*: The Czech Communist Party continues to grow in strength. As of the 9th of this month, it has 2,048,000 members, compared to only 1,300,000 members on New Year's Day this year.

　　法国展开新增资运动
  　捷共党员已逾二百万
    【新华社陕北卅日电】巴黎讯：为反对舒曼当局背弃其在工资与物价间经常保持平衡的诺言，法国工人阶级正在展开新的增资运动。总工会总书记佛拉商于十四日在政府雇员联盟全国代表大会上曾宣布：我们不久将提醒政府注意此项诺言及自己规定的日期。六月一日我们代表工人阶级，将要求恢复一九四七年以前的工资与物价间的平衡。这里所说的六月一日，是法政府约许增资的日子。在此之后，总工会书记处接到基督教劳工联盟书记处的来函，该函建议总工会与其采取联合行动，以保卫工人的要求。此项建议顷已为总工会接受。二十日总工会书记处的复函提出：“提交政府的基本要求中，应包括增资百分之二十，增加年金与津贴以及当物价上涨百分之十时，工资亦须自动提升。”上述消息之公布，为对法国政府之最后通牒。惊慌的舒曼内阁，乃阴谋麻痹法国工人阶级此一行将到来的增资斗争。法新社二十日电透露：“消息灵通方面断言，法政府为避免使业已混乱的政治局势复杂化起见，已决定自六月一日起，法国一切工人均增资百分之八至十。”二十二日，舒曼更亲自发表声明，宣布面包配给量将自二百公分增加到二百五十公分（约合中国市斤半斤），但他却未指出从何日开始实行。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据法新社引捷共真理报材料：捷克共产党在继续壮大中，截至本月九日止，已拥有党员二百零四万八千人，今年元旦时则只有党员一百三十万人。
