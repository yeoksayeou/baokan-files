　　[Taihang News] In early May, Neiqiu districts convened a meeting of village cadres to review production work. Generally, people couldn't report any materials or understand the situation. After the meeting, it was discovered that the guiding principles of this meeting had major flaws: First, various problems and erroneous ideas were not thoroughly resolved; second, village cadres were not guided to recognize their own mistakes, and the erroneous behavior of some party member cadres was not seriously criticized in accordance with principles. There was no organization of typical introspection to promote everyone's introspection and establish a new style and direction. As a result, some cadres remained passive; some became arrogant; and individual village cadres even wanted to retaliate against poor and hired peasants. Production tasks still could not be implemented. The county party committee discovered these situations and immediately assigned a county party committee to specialize in leading production. The district heads and branch secretaries were withdrawn from the land reform base points to lead production. The districts successively held joint meetings of branch and cadres for three to five days in late May, with more than 800 people participating. The leaders spoke about the policy of democracy and party rectification, calling on party members to deeply review their leadership of production work, examine their relationship with the poor peasant leagues and production committees, and their attitude toward the masses, etc. During the deliberation and discussion, a few village cadres in the sixth district still complained a lot. The director of the Beiyang Wu Committee said: "We just had a meeting, and now we have another meeting. If I don't come, the higher-ups will criticize me; if I come, my wife will scold me." The director of the Zhongping Village Wu Committee said: "There is no food at home, and we can't borrow grain, and we still have to be criticized." (Editor's note: Leaders should prepare for meetings and save time. Otherwise, party member cadres who do not separate from production cannot afford it economically, and it cannot be simply regarded as a complaint. As the director of the Zhongping Village Wu Committee said: If life is difficult and he is afraid of being criticized, if this is indeed the case, it cannot be regarded as a complaint. But if there is a real mistake that should be criticized, it should still be criticized.) At the general meetings of the third and sixth districts, some people believed that it was not easy to be a party member and it was better not to be one. In order to reverse the atmosphere, the leaders promptly organized typical introspection. Everyone realized that they did have many mistakes and were in great danger, and that they needed to be rectified quickly. Many people reflected on their mistakes of taking more fruits, suppressing the masses, and corruption and waste. When the party members in the third district reflected on why the poor and hired peasants had opinions about them, they all felt that the root cause was in themselves. The public security officer of Xiyangzhai said: "If we let the masses turn over first, or turn over as evenly as us, the masses will definitely have no objections." (Editor's note: We are not absolute equalitarians, so the problem is not the level or order of the turn over, but whether the interests of the masses are encroached upon.) Some party members once believed that the masses' dissatisfaction with them was initiated by the higher-ups; after arguing, they realized that it was because they had turned over to a high degree and had a bad style of work. When the higher-ups came, the masses would of course raise their opinions. At this time, correct opinions arose, and the leaders explained the principles of education and transformation, citing examples from the land reform base points to illustrate the policy of seeking truth from facts and curing diseases to save people. Many party members in the third district reflected: "This time it's really happy." A party member in Xiaoleidong in the fifth district said: "This time I have to work hard when I go back, and I can't be selfish anymore." Most of the mood improved, and they were determined to lead production work. Then, compensation and resettlement and production tasks were arranged.
    This meeting played a significant role in reversing the mood of party members and branch cadres. The three branch cadres from North Street who participated in the meeting became active, and all departments began to restore and establish their work. The main cadres of each village generally participated in the leadership of the production committee. Although the public security officer of Ningjiazhuang was dismissed due to mistakes, he was not passive in his work, nor did he complain or retaliate against the masses, and he played a leading role in mutual aid production. The masses' impression of him has also greatly improved. The branch secretary of Jin Dian Nanguan did not go to the meeting himself, but watered wheat for military families at home, which was supported by the masses.
    However, because the people who participated in this meeting were not very common, the spirit of the meeting has not yet been fully implemented. Some branch cadres have initially understood their own thinking and are in a good mood, but they do not have the ability to open up the thinking of others. As of the beginning of this month, there are still some chaotic phenomena in some villages, and the old problems have not been completely resolved. The Chengguan branch cadres have asked the leaders to convene a meeting of party members in the base points to implement the spirit of the meeting.

### 内邱各区开支干联席会　扭转情绪推动生产

　　内邱各区开支干联席会
  　扭转情绪推动生产
    【太行讯】内邱各区在五月初曾召开一次村干部会，检查生产工作，一般人都汇报不出什么材料，也不了解情况。会后发现这次会议的指导方针有很大毛病：一是对各种问题及错误思想未彻底解决；二是未引导村干认识自己的错误，对某些党员干部的错误行为没有严肃的坚持原则予以批评，没有组织典型反省推动大家反省，树立新的作风与方向。这样，有一部分干部仍然消极；一部分又自大起来；个别村干甚至想报复贫雇农。生产任务仍然贯彻不下去。县委发现这些情况，即抽出一个县委专门领导生产，各区也将区长、分书从土改基点抽出，转入领导生产，各区于五月下旬先后召开三、五天支干的联席会议，共有八百多人参加。领导上讲了民主与整党政策，号召党员深刻检讨自己对生产工作的领导，检查自己与贫农团、生产委员会的关系，和对群众的态度等。在酝酿讨论的时候，六区仍有少数村干大发牢骚。北阳武委会主任说：“才开了会又开会，不来吧，上级批评；来吧，老婆光骂。”中平村武委会主任说：“家里没吃的，也不能借粮，还得受批评。”（编者按：领导上开会要有准备，要节省时间，否则不脱离生产的党员干部，在经济上也开不起，不能把它简单看成是牢骚。象中平村武委会主任所说：生活有困难又怕受批评，如确系如此，也不能当作牢骚。但真正有错误该批评还应批评。）在三、六区大会上，有人认为当个党员不容易，不如不当。领导上为扭转空气，及时组织了典型反省。大家才感到自己确有许多错误，很危险，就是需要赶快整顿。许多人反省了自己多占果实，压制群众，贪污浪费等错误。三区党员反省到贫雇对自己为什么有意见时，都觉得根源就在自己身上，西羊寨公安员说：“咱如果叫群众先翻身，或跟咱翻得一般平，群众准没意见。”（编者按：我们不是绝对平均主义者，因此问题不在翻身的高低或先后，而是在乎是否侵占了群众果实。）有的党员曾经认为群众对自己不满是上级发动的；经过圪吵，才认识了是因为自己翻身高，作风不好，上级一来，群众当然就提开意见了。这时，正确意见抬头，领导上又讲解了教育改造的道理，举出土改基点的例子，说明实事求是、治病救人的方针。三区有好些党员反映：“这回可痛快啦。”五区小垒东党员说：“这次回去可得好好干哩，再不能自私。”大部情绪好转，决心领导生产工作。接着就布置了补偿安置与生产任务。
    这个会对扭转党员支干的情绪起了显著的作用。北街三个参加会的支干都积极起来了，各部门都开始恢复与建立自己的工作。各村主要干部一般都参加了生产委员会的领导。宁家庄公安员虽因错误被撤职，但对工作毫不消极，也不埋怨或报复群众，并在互助生产中起了带头作用，群众对他的印象也已大为好转。金店南关支书自己不去赶会，在家给军属浇麦，都获得群众拥护。
    但是，由于参加这个会的人不很普遍，会议的精神现在还未完全贯彻下去。有些支干自己思想初步通了，情绪很好，但没有能力去打通其他人的思想。截至本月初，有些村仍有混乱现象，旧的问题还未全部解决。城关支干已向领导上要求分基点召开党员大会，贯彻会议精神。
