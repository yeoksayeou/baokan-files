[Jinnan News] During the seventy days that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit troops were trapped in the isolated city of Linfen, all six secondary schools in the city completely suspended classes. All students and teachers were forced by the bandit troops with bayonets to join the army and work on the front lines to build fortifications. Out of more than 400 people at the Linfen Provincial Normal School, 246 were forced to join the army; out of more than 300 people at Linfen Middle School, nearly 200 were forced to join the army; out of 328 people at Sanlian Middle School, 152 were forced to join the army. Under the slogan of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit troops, "Rather sacrifice ten students than sacrifice one soldier," these students and teachers who were forced to join the army were all assigned to the first company and stationed on the front lines, which were full of artillery fire. When the city of Linfen was in a state of emergency, they were all placed at the front to charge, and countless people died needlessly. Students and teachers who were forced by the bandit troops to build fortifications also suffered countless tortures. The first time they worked, they had to work twelve hours a day; the second time, they had to work twenty-four hours a day and night; the third time, they had to work forty-eight hours for two days and two nights. Later, as the war became tense, they worked day and night without stopping and were not allowed to return. They did not get enough to eat while working, only two small cornbread buns per meal. If their families came to deliver food, they had to pay the bandit troops. Sometimes, if they brought better food, the bandit troops would eat the food first and then take the money. If they slacked off a little while working, the bandit troops would unexpectedly hit them on the head from behind with the butt of a gun or a wooden stick, causing them to bleed. Many people could not bear this kind of hard labor and fell ill. The work was all done on the front lines where the bandit troops dared not go. If anyone was afraid or hesitated, the bandit troops would raise their bayonets and fiercely say, "You are afraid of the Eighth Route Army's shells, but you are not afraid of my bayonet?" Yang Jichang, an old teacher in his fifties from Sanlian Middle School, was wounded by a shell when he was forced to build fortifications in Dongguan and died after returning. Once, 100 people from the school carried 50 door panels to Dongguan to build fortifications, but only 50 people returned. Everyone said painfully, "One door panel is worth one life." The casualties of other schools doing construction are still impossible to count.

　　蒋阎匪摧残教育之一斑
    【晋南消息】蒋阎匪军困守临汾孤城的七十天当中，全市六个中等学校完全停课，学生教员全部被匪军用刺刀逼着参军和上火线做工事。临汾省立师范全校四百余人，被逼参军的二百四十六人；临汾中学全校三百余人，被逼参军的将近二百人；三联中全校三百二十八人，被逼参军的一百五十二人。在蒋阎匪军“宁愿牺牲十个学生，不能牺牲一个士兵”的口号下，这些被逼参军的学生教员都被编为第一连队，据守于炮火连天的最前线。当临汾城告急时，他们都被编在前面打冲锋，无谓死伤的不知多少。被匪军逼着做工事的学生教员，也受尽无数折磨。第一次做工，要做够一天十二小时；第二次要做够一天一夜廿四小时；第三次要做够两天两夜四十八小时。以后战事紧张，日夜不停的做工，不得回去。做工吃不饱，每顿两个小窝窝头。家里来送饭，要给匪军花钱。有时送来较好的饭，匪军先把饭吃掉，又把钱拿掉。做工稍为松懈，匪军冷不防以枪托木棍从背后打得头破血流。许多人受不了这种苦役，病倒不起。做工都是跑到匪军不敢上去的最前线，谁要是害怕，迟疑，匪军即端起刺刀凶凶地说：“你就害怕八路军的炮弹，就不害怕我的刺刀？”三联中一个五十余岁的老教员杨际昌，被逼到东关做工事时，一颗炮弹把他打伤，回去就死掉了。该校一次有一百个人扛着五十付门板到东关做工事，回来只剩下五十个人。大家都痛心的说：“一块门板抵了一条命。”其他各校做工死伤的尚无法统计。
