　　Why is the Director of the Cejing Farmers' Association Preventing Liu Shuanhe from Marrying?
　　Xishahe District Office Investigates and Handles
　　Liu Shuanhe, a farmer from Cejing Village, Shahe, traveled a long distance to our newspaper a few days ago. Holding two red marriage certificates, he told the reporter with great sadness: "I am forty-five years old this year. My parents and brothers all died when I was young. I had no house or land. Later, I rented land from landlord Xie Liansheng (phonetic). I didn't have enough to eat or drink and couldn't make a living. When I was in my twenties, I became addicted to Jindan (a type of drug), which made it even harder. I went to Yueyang Mountain to beg, and I stopped using Jindan. At first, I worked as a long-term laborer, then always as a temporary laborer. Last year, the Farmers' Association gave me 2.7 mu of land, and I also cleared 7 or 8 mu of hillside land.
　　Ma Shuangzhen (female) is also from my village, Cejing. She is forty-six years old. During the famine years, she, her mother, and her husband fled to Tunliu, where they lived for two years. Four years ago, she went to Yueyang Mountain to find her father. Later, her father died, and her husband was also killed by the "old days" (poverty/hardship). She spun cotton and wove cloth to make a living. She has a daughter, twelve years old, and a son, eleven years old, as well as a sick mother who cannot move. Since they had no one, she asked me to sell her cloth for thread. This January, she said, 'Let's get married!' I said, 'Let's get married here in Yueyang!' She said that in Cejing she had three rooms, five mu of land, and cabinets and tables with clothes inside. If we go back and get married, we can have these things. We can't get them if we marry in Shanxi. I was afraid she was deceiving me if I didn't go back, but she said, 'I won't deceive you, go down!' I sold all the grain I harvested last year, and set off on the nineteenth day of the second lunar month, arriving home on the twenty-seventh. When I came back, the Farmers' Association lent me three rooms and two mu of land. She returned to her home, and after a few days came to find me to get married. I told her to find an introducer, and she found Zhang Qiu from Xiaqiu. On the day of the wedding, I notified the Women's Director, the Village Chief, and the Deputy Director of the Farmers' Association. The introducer looked for the Director of the Farmers' Association, but he was out. The Village Chief said, 'As long as you two are willing, why wouldn't I let you? Go to the District Office!' The introducer went to ask her brother-in-law the day before, and he said, 'I never cared before, why would I care about her after we separated? The children cannot be brought.' On May 12th, we went to the District Office and completed the procedures (the District Office is in our village). She and her nephew went back to her home. She said she was going back to make a pair of shoes, and would be done in one day. Who knew that after she went back, they wouldn't let us see each other again. We haven't met since.
　　On the third day, I asked the introducer to pick her up, but the Director of the Farmers' Association, Jia Dingwen, wouldn't let us see her. Later, he went to the District Office and said, 'First rape, then marry, they can't get married.' He told the District Office to ask me for the marriage certificates, but the District Office said they couldn't ask for them, and he should ask for them himself. He asked the introducer, and the introducer said, 'I'm not feeling well and can't move.' The Director of the Farmers' Association asked him, 'Can you not take care of this matter?' The introducer said, 'It's not that I want to take care of it! This woman asked me to take care of it.' I heard people in the street say that the Director of the Farmers' Association also said to others, 'If the woman comes to find me, drag her away. If the men come to find me, break their legs. There's no need to ask him for the marriage certificates, carrying them doesn't mean anything.' I was so scared that I didn't even dare to pass by their door, and I took a detour to carry water. When I went to the District Office, they also said, 'It doesn't count anymore.' People in the street are saying to me, 'Even if you got married, it's useless, don't go, you can't get the person back.' I heard from her neighbors that she (Ma Shuangzhen) cries at home all the time, day and night, and doesn't dare to go out. When she goes out, someone chases her away. She is too old-fashioned and doesn't say a word, and usually never makes a sound...
　　What I want is: To see if I can get her back. I can't afford to offend them, and I don't know anyone in the village, and no one listens to me. She only went to Yueyang Mountain four years ago, and I only sold her cloth last autumn, and they say I was having an affair with her for six years and can't get married. Can a Director of the Farmers' Association bully people like this? I can't sleep day and night and am asking around everywhere. Where can I appeal my grievances? People say I can appeal to the newspaper. I traveled for three days, asking around all the way. I heard in ×× Village that you had left, and I planned to go back and work for a few days, and then go north in May. Later, I asked again in Baiguan and ran into the work team and found out you hadn't left, and I found you here. What can I do about this? Can I get her back?' Later, he took out a certificate from Yueyang Mountain, saying that he was a very good poor peasant there. Before leaving, he also said, 'I'll come back if it's not resolved!'"

　　册井农会主任为何不让刘拴和结婚？
  　希沙河区公所检查处理
    沙河册井村农民刘拴和，前几天远道跑到本报来，拿着两张红色结婚证书，很难过的对记者说：“我今年四十五岁，起小俺爹俺娘哥哥都死了，也没有房子地，后来半租地主谢连生（音）的地，没吃喝，顾不住生活。二十几岁时吸上金丹，更没法，要饭去岳阳山，金丹也不吸了。起初当长工，后来一直打忙工，去年农会才给了我二亩七分地，我又刨了七八亩坡地。
    马双珍（女）也是俺册井村人，四十六岁。灾荒年，她和她娘、汉子逃难到屯留，住了二年，四年前去岳阳山找他爹，后来他爹死了，汉子也叫老日子杀了，她纺花织布过时光。有一个闺女，十二岁，一个小子十一岁，还有个病娘不能动，没有人，叫我给他卖布换线。今年正月，她说：“咱结婚吧！”我说：“结婚咱就在这里（岳阳）结吧！”她说册井有她三间房、五亩地，还有柜、桌子，里头还有衣裳。回去结婚，这东西咱还能要。在山西结婚咱不能得。我不回来，怕她哄我，她说：“我不能亏心，你下去吧！”我把去年打的粮食一满粜了，二月十九日（阴历）起身，二十七到家。回来农会借给我三间房，二亩地。她回到她家，过了几天来找我结婚，我叫她找介绍人，她找下张秋的。结婚那天，妇女主任、村长、农会副主任，我都通知到了。介绍人找农会正主任，他出门了，没找着。村长说：“只要你俩情愿，我还能不叫？你们去区上吧！”介绍人头一天去问她大伯子，他说：“从前我都不管，分了家我还管她？孩子是不能带。”五月十二日，俺俩去区上办好手续（区就在本村），她和她侄儿又回了她家。说回去做对鞋，一天做停当就来。谁知道回去以后，人家就不叫再见人啦。到如今永没见面。
    第三天，我叫介绍人去接她，农会正主任贾定文不叫见，后来他去区上说：“先奸后娶，不能结婚”。叫区上问我要结婚证书，区上说区上不能要，叫他自己要。他找介绍人要，介绍人说：“我这会身上难受不能动”。农会主任问他“你能不能不管这事？”介绍人说：“不是我要管来！这个女人找我叫我管。”我听街里人说，　农会主任又对人说：“要是妇女来找，拖她，汉们来找，劈了他的腿。结婚证书也不用问他要，带着这也不顶啥”。我吓的连人家的门都不敢过，担水都绕着走。去区上问，区上也说：“不算啦”。街里人都说我：“你结了婚也搭啦，不用去，去了也不能要人”。听她邻家说，她（马双珍）在家光哭，黑地白天哭，不敢出门，出门有人撵。她这个人太老气，一句话也不会说，平素永不吭……。
    我的意思：“来看看能要人不能。咱惹不起人家，咱到村谁也不认得，给谁说谁也不理。她才去了岳阳山四年，去年秋天我才给她卖布，就说我和她流氓了六年啦，不能结婚。一个农会主任就这么欺负人？我黑地白天睡不着，到处打听。那里能诉诉冤，人家说报馆能诉。我走了三天，一路打听，到××村听说走了，我打算回去打几天忙工，过五月再去北边找。后来又问到百官，碰上工作组才知道没有走，找到这里。你看看我这个有啥办法？能要人不能？”后来他拿出岳阳山给他开的证明，说他在那里是一个很好的贫农。临走时他还说：“要解决不了我还来！”
