　　Shijiazhuang Government Organs, Military Units, and Schools
  　Help the Masses with Wheat Harvesting
    [Shijiazhuang News] In Shijiazhuang, various government organs, military units, and schools have been helping the masses with the wheat harvest for several days. Cadres from the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Districts, led by their respective district chiefs, have been helping the masses pull wheat. According to preliminary statistics, they have completed more than 60 mu. Deputy Director Wang of the Municipal Public Security Bureau led the bureau's staff on the morning of June 4th to help farmers in Beijiao Village pull 30 mu of wheat. The 6th Branch Bureau's service team, in addition to patrolling at night to protect the wheat fields, also helps the families of military cadres pull wheat during the day. More than 260 faculty members and students from the Construction College pulled 120 mu of wheat in one instance. Troops stationed in various departments have been particularly active in helping the people with the wheat harvest. According to incomplete statistics for the past few days, various units have pulled more than 2,000 mu of wheat. In addition to helping the families of military personnel stationed in the villages and farmers lacking labor to pull wheat, a certain unit also provided its own two large carts and fifteen animals to transport wheat for the villagers for 50 mu. The 7th and 8th squads of a certain company of the Garrison Command each pulled an average of more than one mu of wheat. All cadres and service personnel of the Political Department pulled nearly twice as much wheat as assigned in two days. Comrade Liang Chunguang of the Military Law Department, who is a second-class disabled person, also participated every day, which greatly moved the masses. They said: "When the Kuomintang was in power, not only did they not help the people, but when the wheat was ripe, the people wanted to pull it early in the morning, but they didn't open the checkpoint until after nine o'clock; if they wanted to do some work at night, they would shoot people when they saw them. Now, public officials are helping to pull wheat. This is truly the people's government and the people's army."

  　帮助群众麦收
    【石家庄讯】石市各机关、部队、学校，连日帮助群众麦收。五、六、七、八区干部均在各该区长率领下，分别帮助群众拔麦，据初步统计，已达六十余亩。市公安局王副局长于六月四日晨，率领该局工作人员，帮北焦村农民拔麦三十亩。六分局服务队，除夜间巡逻保护麦田外，白天并帮军干属拔麦。建设学院教职学员二百六十多人，一次拔麦一百二十亩。各部驻军助民麦收尤为积极，据近几日不完全统计，各部共拔麦二千余亩，某部除帮驻村军属及缺劳力农民拔麦外，并抽出自己两辆大车，十五头牲口，给老乡运麦五十亩。警备司令部某连七、八班每人平均拔麦一亩以上。政治部全体干部勤杂人员，两天拔麦超过任务近一倍。军法梁春光同志系二等残废，也每天参加，群众十分感动，他们说：“国民党在时，不但不帮助老百姓，麦熟了老百姓想清早去拔，他们不到九点不开卡口；想在夜间干点活，他们看见人就放枪。现在公家人帮助拔麦子，这真是人民的政府，人民的军队。”
