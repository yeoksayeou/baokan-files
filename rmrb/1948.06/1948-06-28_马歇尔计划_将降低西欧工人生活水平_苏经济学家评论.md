　　The Marshall Plan
  　Will Lower the Living Standards of Western European Workers
  　Soviet Economist Comments
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] TASS dispatch, 16th. The Soviet magazine "New Era" recently published an article by the famous economist, Ku Xingsiji [Kuznetsov], entitled "The Marshall Plan and the Living Standards of Western European Workers." Ku Xingsiji's main conclusions are: (1) The living standards prescribed by the Marshall Plan for Western European workers for 1950-1951 will be lower than the difficult days of 1934-1938. (2) Due to the maturing economic crisis in the United States and Western Europe, even this reduced plan will not be realized, and the actual living standards of Western European workers will be even lower than those prescribed by the Marshall Plan. (3) In this regard, a particularly important fact is that although the Soviet Union has suffered extensive war damage, the current living standards of the Soviet people are already higher than anywhere else in Europe, and by 1951, the living standards of the Soviet people will reach an unprecedented level in human history. Equally undeniable is that in the Eastern European People's Democracies, by 1950-1951, the people's living standards will also exceed pre-war levels and will be higher than at any time in their own history.

　　马歇尔计划
  　将降低西欧工人生活水平
  　苏经济学家评论
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社十六日电，苏联“新时代”杂志顷发表著名经济学家库辛斯基题为“马歇尔计划与西欧工人生活水准”的论文，库辛斯基的主要结论是：（一）马歇尔计划给西欧工人规定的一九五零至一九五一年的生活水平，较一九三四至一九三八年困苦的日子还要低。（二）由于美国和西欧在成熟中的经济危机，这一缩小的计划亦将不能实现，西欧工人的实际生活水平，将较马歇尔计划所规定者更低。（三）在这方面，特别重要的事实是：苏联虽遭受战争的广泛破坏，但苏联人民目前的生活水平已较欧洲任何地方为高，而至一九五一年时，苏联国人的生活水平将达到人类史上的空前高度。同样不可忽视的是，在东欧人民民主国家中，到了一九五○至一九五一年时，人民生活水准亦将超过战前水平，并将较它们本国历史上的任何时期为高。
