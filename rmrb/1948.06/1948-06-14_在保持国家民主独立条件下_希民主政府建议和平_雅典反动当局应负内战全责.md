Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS dispatch of the 2nd quoted a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio: The Greek Provisional Democratic Government issued a statement on the 1st of this month stating: This government is prepared to welcome any proposals aimed at establishing peace in Greece under the following conditions: These conditions are to ensure the democratic way of life of the Greek people, maintain Greece's national sovereignty and independence, end all foreign interference, and allow Greece to freely decide its own destiny. The statement continued: The democratic government believes that although the United States and Britain have provided extensive assistance to the Athens government, the royalist fascists are still facing increasing difficulties, the national economy is rapidly deteriorating, and corruption is becoming more and more serious. The terror in cities and villages and the killing of fighters for national liberation have aroused the indignation of people around the world. The democratic government pointed out: All offensives launched by the royalist fascists have so far failed, and the recent full-scale invasion of 35,000 people in the Romilia region has also met with the same result. The Democratic Army is more active than ever before and has achieved significant victories in the Moria Peninsula, the Epirus region, and other provinces. The connection between the liberation movement and the people is becoming stronger and stronger. Considering the current situation, the democratic government has decided to issue this statement and announce its readiness to make all concessions that the people will agree to. This statement of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government has won the warm sympathy of all the Greek people and all those around the world who are concerned about the fate of the Greek people and the interests of world peace. At the same time, it has aroused the panic and embarrassment of the Athens government, which Athens newspapers called "ruled by foreign telegrams and radio." The Athens reactionary government rejected the proposal of the Greek Democratic Government, thus proving to the world that it should bear full responsibility for the Greek civil war, and making itself more isolated both at home and abroad.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Agence France-Presse quoted a broadcast from Free Greece Radio: The General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, Zachariadis, gave a radio speech on the evening of the 5th, stating: "The specific proposals of the Provisional Government are based on national interests, requiring an end to foreign interference, while the royalist fascist government is precisely trying to avoid this." After pointing out that the royalist fascists' previous "offensives" had all failed, Zachariadis said: "Our proposal is for the benefit of the Greek people and to answer the expectations of world opinion, and it is by no means due to the weakness of the Democratic Army."
According to TASS: The British League for Greek Democratization issued a statement on the 2nd, welcoming the proposal of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government and expressing indignation at the Athens government's rejection of this peace call. The statement pointed out: "The Athens government has consistently refused to resolve the problem democratically, confirming that it should bear the responsibility for the continued civil war and bloodshed in the country." The statement called on the British government to take measures to promote the resolution of the Greek problem based on the proposals put forward by the Provisional Democratic Government.

　　在保持国家民主独立条件下
  　希民主政府建议和平
    雅典反动当局应负内战全责
    【新华社陕北十日电】据塔斯社二日电引自由希腊电台广播：希腊临时民主政府于本月一日发表声明称：本政府准备在如下条件下，欢迎任何旨在建立希腊和平的建议；这些条件便是确保希腊人民的民主生活方式，保持希腊的国家主权与独立，终止一切外国干涉，使希腊自由地解决自身之命运。声明继称：民主政府认为虽然美英两国给予雅典政府以广泛之援助，但保皇法西斯仍遭到日益增长的困难，国家经济正在迅速恶化，贪污舞弊日甚一日。在城市与乡村中的恐怖与对民族解放运动战士的残杀，激起了世界人士的愤慨。民主政府指出：保皇法西斯分子迄今所发动的一切攻势均已失败，最近在罗米利亚区的三万五千人的全力进犯，也遭到同一结果。民主军已较前史为活跃，并在摩里亚半岛爱匹鲁斯地区及其他省份获得显著胜利。解放运动与人民间的联系越来越强固了，民主政府考虑到目前的局势，决定发表此一声明，并宣布准备作人民将予同意的一切让步。希腊临时民主政府的这一声明，博得了全希腊人民和全世界一切关心希腊人民命运与世界和平利益的人们的热烈同情，同时也引起了雅典报纸所称“由外国用电报和无线电统治”的雅典政府的惊慌与狼狈。雅典反动政府拒绝了希腊民主政府的建议，因而向全世界证明了它应负希腊内战的全责，并使自己在国内外更加陷于孤立。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据法新社引自由希腊电台广播：希共总书记萨查利亚蒂斯于五日晚发表广播演说称：“临时政府的具体建议，是基于国家利益，要求结束外国的干涉，而保皇法西斯政府恰恰企图避免这点。萨氏指出保皇法西斯分子的历次“进攻”均告破产之后称：“我们的建议是为了希腊人民的利益和回答世界舆论的期望，绝不是由于民主军的软弱。”
    另据塔斯社讯：英国争取希腊民主化同盟于二日发表声明，欢迎希腊临时民主政府的建议，并对雅典政府的拒绝这一和平呼吁表示义愤，声明指出：“雅典政府始终拒绝民主解决问题，证实它应负该国继续内战与流血之责。”声明要求英政府采取措施，促使希腊根据临时民主政府所提建议解决问题。
