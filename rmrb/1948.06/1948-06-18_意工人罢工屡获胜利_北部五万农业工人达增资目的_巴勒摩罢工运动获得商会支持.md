Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. The struggle for wage increases by agricultural workers in the northern Italian provinces is rising and winning repeatedly. According to a United Press dispatch dated the 10th: In Bologna province, after 50,000 agricultural workers continued their strike for 17 days and achieved victory, less than 24 hours later, more than 25,000 agricultural workers in Parma province, northwest of Bologna, began a strike. Agricultural workers in Cremona achieved victory on the 6th after striking for 13 days. As a result of the strikes in Bologna and Cremona provinces, landlords suffered losses of more than 2 billion lire in livestock and agricultural equipment. According to a TASS dispatch: Workers in Bologna announced a 24-hour general strike on the 4th to protest the police authorities' arrest of agricultural worker leaders. During the strike, all factories, government agencies, and urban transportation systems stopped work. Printing workers refused to typeset orders issued by the police headquarters prohibiting workers from gathering and demonstrating during the strike, and made it impossible for all reactionary newspapers in Bologna to be published. The strike movement in Sicily is also growing. The Executive Committee of the Palermo Chamber of Commerce decided to hold a province-wide general strike on June 7 to support the demands of the workers at the Piajola shipyard. All metalworkers in Palermo also held a sympathy strike on the 5th. The workers at the Piajola shipyard, in order to oppose the factory's closure measures implemented after the failure to dismiss some workers without reason, took over the management of the factory on their own initiative on May 9 and have continued to do so until now.
