Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 28th: Reports from various sources: The US, British, and French occupying authorities in Germany unilaterally announced on the 18th that, starting June 21st, a so-called new currency system would be implemented in the US, British, and French occupation zones of Germany (and on the 23rd, an order was issued to include the US, British, and French occupation zones of Berlin). The new currency is named the "Deutsche Mark," with each Mark worth one hundred pfennigs (German copper coins). All original banknotes ("Reichsmarks," "Rentenmarks," "Allied Marks," etc.) were to be discontinued; only one-Mark banknotes and coins could still circulate, but their value was one-tenth of the new currency.

The US and British preparations to implement a "new currency system" in West Germany have been underway for a long time. According to an article in the Hamburg "Die Welt" cited by TASS, the US and Britain had been preparing a separate "currency reform" since the early autumn of 1945 in order to restore the former political and economic position of West German monopoly capitalists in Germany. By the summer of 1946, American figures had begun to formulate a West German "currency reform" plan with representatives of German big capital. The first plan was drafted by former German professor Kehrim, who now lives in the United States. According to the Communist Youth League Pravda, former president of the Deutsche Bank and war criminal Schacht was invited to participate in the drafting of the "currency reform" plan.

Another TASS report stated: The "new currency system" has already brought disaster to the German people in the US, British, and French occupation zones. On the day before the exchange of old and new currencies, Germans could not even buy bread with the old currency; restaurants and food stores refused to sell rationed food. On the 21st, when the partial exchange of old and new currencies began, people in many places lined up to wait five or even seven hours before the exchange offices opened; in some cities, the lines were as long as one kilometer. In Munich, the center of the US zone, people stood waiting for eight to ten hours; in Hamburg, the center of the British zone, many exchange offices delayed opening for two or three hours. West German economic figures predict that unemployment will increase as a result of the "currency reform." Bennett, the chief financial advisor of the US zone, also made the same prediction. After the "currency reform" was announced, black market prices for goods soared in various parts of West Germany, with one American cigarette costing forty Marks. As a result, even the so-called General Confederation of Trade Unions, which has always supported US and British policies, stated that it would demand a 15% increase in wages, and the Bavarian Socialist People's Party also demanded a 30% increase. Factories in Hamburg have laid off workers in large numbers, and many factories have temporarily suspended operations. A serious famine threat has emerged in the Ruhr area because bakeries and food stores are unwilling to sell food due to the issuance of the new currency. This is as the Communist Youth League Pravda commented: "The main goal of this currency reform is to consolidate the position of big capitalists, another tool for implementing the policy of famine and lowering the living standards of the broad masses of the German people; and to turn West Germany into a paradise for speculators to get rich." (TASS)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 28th: TASS reports: Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, sent a letter on the 20th to Generals Clay, Robertson, and Koenig, Commanders-in-Chief of the US, British, and French forces in Germany, respectively, denouncing them for making unilateral and illegal decisions without notifying the Allied Control Council for Germany or obtaining its consent, abolishing the unified currency system, and thus completing the division of Germany. Marshal Sokolovsky emphasized in the letter that the basic principles of currency reform throughout Germany had been agreed upon by all four parties in the Control Council; however, this reform has been hindered by the separate actions of West Germany. Marshal Sokolovsky warned that actions aimed at undermining the agreements of the Allied control institutions in Germany are illegal, and the US, British, and French authorities should bear full responsibility for such actions.

The German People's Council, representing all strata, parties, and organizations in Germany, also issued a declaration on the 19th stating that the separate currency reform announced by the commanders of the Western three occupation zones constitutes a decisive action to realize the division of Germany. Under the currency reform, the West German state has been established in the planned manner and has become an economic and military base of operations for the US-British Western bloc. The Presidium of the German People's Council, on behalf of the German people, firmly protests this outrage perpetrated against the German people.

### 美英法悍然分裂德国　片面施行“新币制”　德国人民委员会坚决抗议

　　美英法悍然分裂德国
  　片面施行“新币制”
  　德国人民委员会坚决抗议
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方报导：德国美英法占领当局于十八日片面的宣布：自六月二十一日起，在德境美英法占领区（廿三日又下令将柏林美英法占领区包括在内）实行所谓新币制。新币定名为“德意志马克”，每马克值一百芬尼（德铜币）。原有一切纸币（“帝国马克”、“仑吞马克”、“盟国马克”等）一律停止使用；仅一马克的纸币与硬币仍可流通，但其币值为新币的十分之一。
    美英方面之准备在西德实行“新币制”由来已久。据塔斯社引汉堡“世界报”论文称：自一九四五年初秋起，美英就在准备单独的“货币改革”，以便恢复西德垄断资本家从前在德国政治与经济方面的地位。至一九四六年夏，美国人士即与德国大资本的代理人开始拟订西德“货币改革”计划。第一个计划由现居美国的前德国教授柯尔姆拟成。又据少共真理报称，此次“货币改革”计划之草拟，曾邀请前德意志银行总裁大战犯沙赫特参加。
    另据塔斯社报导：“新币制”已给美英法占领区的德国人民带来了灾害。在新旧货币兑换的前一天，德国人甚至用旧币已买不到面包；餐馆、粮食店都拒绝出售配给的食物。二十一日，当新旧货币的部分兑换开始时，许多地方的人们，在兑换所开门以前五小时甚至七小时，就列队等待；在某些城市，行列长达一公里。在美占区中心慕尼黑，人们站着等了八小时到十小时；在英占区中心汉堡，许多兑换所延迟两三个小时才开门。西德经济界人士预料，失业人数将因“货币改革”而增加。美占区首席财政顾问贝涅特亦作同样预测。“货币改革”宣布后，西德各地物品黑市价格飞涨不已，一支美国香烟即需四十马克。以致连一向支持美英政策的所谓总工会亦声明，该会将要求增资百分之十五，巴伐利亚社会主义人民党也要求增资百分之三十。汉堡的工厂已大批解雇工人，许多工厂已暂时停工。鲁尔区发生严重的饥荒威胁，因为面包坊和粮食店正因新币的发行而不愿把食粮出售。这正如少共真理报的评论所指出：“这次货币改革的主要目标就是巩固大资本家的地位，是实施饥馑与降低德国人民广大群众生活标准这一政策的另一工具；并把西德变为投机家发财致富的乐园。”（塔斯社）
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社报导：德境苏军总司令索柯洛夫斯基元帅，于二十日致函德境美军总司令克莱、英军总司令罗伯逊及法军总司令柯宁，斥责他们不通知盟国对德管委会，也没有得到它的同意，就作出片面的非法决定，取消了币制的统一，从而完成了德国的分裂。索帅在信中着重指出：全德范围货币改革的基本原则，曾获管委会中四方面的同意；但这种改革已为西德的单独行动所阻挠。索帅警告称：以破坏德境盟国管制机构的协议为目的的行动是不合法的，美英法当局应负这种行动的全部责任。
    代表全德各阶层各党派各团体的德国人民委员会，也于十九日发表宣言称：西方三占领区司令所宣布的单独的货币改革，构成了实现德国分裂的决定性行动。在货币改革之下，西德国家已按照预定的模样建立起来，成为美英西方集团的经济和军事的行动基地。德国人民委员会主席团代表德国人民，坚决抗议这个对德国人民所施的暴行。
