Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Washington dispatch: Under the slogan "March on Washington," six thousand leaders and representatives of various progressive groups in the United States held a magnificent anti-Mundt Bill demonstration in Washington on the 2nd. Among them, more than three thousand six hundred people marched and surrounded the White House, demanding the repeal of this fascist bill. Black singer Paul Robeson, Congressman Vito Marcantonio, and Isaacson delivered passionate speeches, sharply criticizing the Mundt Bill and urging Congress to resolve the bill. Black leader Ms. Jackson sarcastically said: "The United States is busy exporting democracy, so much so that we cannot obtain enough democracy in the United States." Delkin, chairman of the CIO’s United Office and Professional Workers of America, condemned the Mundt Act as being identical to Hitler's actions after seizing power. After the meeting, the demonstrators marched in four columns to the front of the White House to demonstrate. The order along the way was well-maintained, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS, Washington dispatch: Stacher, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party USA and director of the Education Committee of the Communist Party USA, who was illegally arrested by the US Department of Justice a few days ago, has been released on bail after the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party USA exposed the conspiracy of the Department of Justice. Prior to this, the Central Committee of the Communist Party USA issued a statement on this matter, stating that the Department of Justice’s arrest of Stacher was to divert people’s attention from the anti-Mundt Bill. The statement continued: "We call on all trade unions and the people of the country to redouble their efforts to defeat this infamous Hitler measure and demand that the Department of Justice stop attempting to punish the people for their political views and activities."

  　三千群众包围白宫
    要求取消这个法西斯法案
    【新华社陕北七日电】华盛顿讯：在“向华盛顿进军”的口号下，美国各进步团体领袖及代表六千人，于二日在华盛顿举行雄壮的反蒙特法示威大会，其中三千六百余人并举行游行，包围白宫，要求取消此一法西斯法案。黑人歌王罗伯逊、众议员马肯托尼奥、伊萨克逊发表激昂的演说，尖锐抨击蒙特法案，并力促国会解决该法案。黑人领袖杰克逊女士讥讽地说：“美国正忙于输出民主，以致我们在美国已不能获得足够的民主了。”产联机关职工会主席德尔金痛斥蒙特法与希特勒夺取政权后的行动如出一辙。会后，示威者以四路纵队的队形行至白宫门前示威，沿途秩序井然，情绪至为热烈。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：数日前为美国司法部非法逮捕之美共中委兼美共教育委员会主任斯塔彻，在美共中执委揭破司法部之阴谋后，已被保释出狱。在此以前，美共中央曾对此事发表声明称：司法部之逮捕斯塔彻，乃是为了转移人民对反蒙特法案之注意力。声明继称：“我们呼吁各工会及全国人民加倍努力，打败此不名誉的希特勒措施，要求司法部停止因政见及政治活动而惩办人民之企图。”
