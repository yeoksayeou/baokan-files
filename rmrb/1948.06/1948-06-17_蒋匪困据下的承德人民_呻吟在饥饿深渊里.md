　　The People of Chengde Under Chiang Kai-shek's Oppression
　　Groaning in the Abyss of Hunger
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: Chengde News: The 80,000 citizens of Chengde City, under Chiang Kai-shek's oppressive rule, are groaning in the abyss of hunger. Farmers in the suburbs are also commonly eating leaves and soil (Guanyin soil). In Hongshiman Village, nine out of ten households, comprising over a hundred families, have no food left to last overnight. A few families rely on men going up the mountains every day to collect firewood and carry it to the city to exchange for some grain to barely survive. Most are starving every day, eating grass and leaves. Most of the land is barren, and very few farmers have the cattle and seeds for spring plowing. Prices in the city are soaring. According to statistics from Chiang Kai-shek controlled newspapers in March, Chengde's general cost of living index had already risen to more than thirty-five times what it was a year ago. The local Chiang Kai-shek "self-defense force," armed with guns but lacking food, robs everywhere. The puppet county magistrate also admits that the cause of the famine is that "the army (referring to Chiang's army) forcibly purchases fodder and the local teams have eaten it all."

　　Before the People's Liberation Army withdrew from Chengde in September of the year before last, primary school teachers could receive a monthly salary of more than nine dou of rice. Now, high school teachers' monthly salaries can only buy half a dou of rice, and they never receive it on time. Teachers have to rely on collecting "study rice" from students to maintain their meals, but the students are suffering greatly, and collection is not easy. Students, due to malnutrition, often suffer from night blindness, and often bump their heads when going to the toilet at night. Among the students of the Kuomintang-run Joint Middle School, a satirical song called "Five Great Unions" describing their living conditions is circulating, saying, "Eating is a union of grain, sand, and millet; classroom and playground are united on rainy days; two or three people share a book, a union of learning; wearing single clothes in winter and cotton clothes in spring, a union of seasons; three people share a quilt, a union of sleeping." Since Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Chengde, they have conscripted soldiers seven times, but each time it becomes more difficult. Recently, even forced recruitment is not enough, so they forcibly concentrated students from four middle schools in the city, put them in military uniforms, and sent them to the battlefield.

### 蒋匪困据下的承德人民　呻吟在饥饿深渊里

　　蒋匪困据下的承德人民
  　呻吟在饥饿深渊里
    【新华社东北十四日电】承德消息：蒋匪困踞下的承德城八万市民，呻吟在饥饿的深渊里。四郊农民也普遍吃着树叶和泥土（观音土）。红石蛮村一百多户人家，十有九户没有隔夜存粮，少数人家靠男人每天上山打柴背到城里换点粮食苟延性命，大部分是天天挨饿吃草吃树叶。土地大部荒芜，有耕牛籽种可以春耕的农民，寥寥无几。城里的物价飞涨。据三月份蒋区报纸的统计，承德的一般生活指数，即已升到了一年前的三十五倍以上。有枪无粮的土蒋“自卫队”，则到处抢劫，伪县长也承认饥荒的原因是“军队（指蒋军）强行采购马料及被地方团队吃光了”。
    前年九月，解放军撤离承德前，小学教职员每月可得九斗米以上的薪金，现在高小教员每月薪水则只能买到半斗米，而且从来不能按月领到，教职员只有依靠向学生征“学米”来维持伙食，但学生很苦，征收也不容易。学生因营养不良，多患夜盲，晚间大小便常有人碰破头皮。国民党办的联中学生中，流传着一首描写他们生活情形的“五大联合”讽刺歌说，“吃饭是谷子沙子小米联合；雨天上课，教室操场联合；两三个人一本书，学习联合；冬天穿单衣，春天穿棉衣，季节联合；三个人一床被窝，睡觉联合。”蒋匪侵占承认后，已征兵七次，但一次比一次困难，最近因强抓亦不够数，即强行集中城内四个中学的学生，给他们换上军衣，送到战场上去。
