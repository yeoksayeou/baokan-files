　　Determining Correct Wage System
  　Xingtai City's Industrial Operations Expand
    [Taihang News] Since the private Tongju Gong Iron Factory and Guanghua Electric Light Company in Xingtai City established a correct wage system, both the factory owners and workers have been actively engaged in production and expanded their business. Zhang Zhihe, the manager of Tongju Gong Iron Factory, feared struggle last year and proposed to the workers that in addition to their monthly wages, profits would be split on a 30/70 basis (70% to workers, 30% to capital). As the capitalist could not make a profit, he lost interest in management, and business became increasingly sluggish. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline and the Central Bureau's policy of protecting industry and commerce, the factory, based on the "labor-capital mutual benefit" wage principle, conducted a five-day discussion, reviewed past shortcomings, and formulated new wage standards, future business directions, and various systems. Both parties became active. In three months, they produced and sold 20 cotton ginning bows, 6 waterwheels, and many other agricultural implements. Recently, they rented five more rooms, purchased a new lathe, and are actively renovating the interior to expand production. After democratic discussions at the Minsheng Iron Factory to increase capital, workers increased night shifts to rush production. The factory recently contracted to make 1,000 screws for the government, to be delivered within ten days. However, the factory had only two furnaces, one of which was used to make cotton ginning bow parts, leaving only one furnace to make screws. In ten days, only over 700 screws were produced, failing to complete the task. The factory owner immediately convened a meeting of all workers in the factory to study methods to complete the task ahead of schedule. Workers voluntarily proposed increasing night shifts. To avoid interfering with daytime work, they decided to have four people take turns working each night until the lights went out. This way, they could produce 30 more screws each night, and each worker could earn an extra 525 yuan in wages. Furthermore, since Guanghua Electric Light Company implemented worker-elected representatives to participate in the factory management committee, and after a month of study, the workers' class consciousness was unprecedentedly enhanced, and their work enthusiasm and creativity greatly increased. Technician Yang Shuchun voluntarily reduced his monthly salary by 60 jin of white flour. In addition to his daytime work, he also added night shifts, and worked with workers to study the use of flaxseed oil mixed with soap and rosin to replace cylinder oil, overcoming the difficulty of buying cylinder oil even with money. He also used cotton thread rope instead of chicken feather rope and made all parts himself, saving the factory expenses. Machine room technician Wang Zhiqin, in addition to repairing machines, voluntarily squeezed out time to work outside, increasing the company's income, earning more than 500,000 yuan since last winter to this spring. The fire-burning workers saved 500 jin of coal per day compared to the past, while also ensuring no reduction in air pressure.

　　确定正确工资制度
  　邢市工业扩大经营
    【太行消息】邢台市私营同聚公铁工厂及光华电灯公司，自确定了正确的工资制度后，厂方、工人都积极生产，扩大营业。同聚公铁工厂经理张致和在去年怕斗争，即向工人提出工人每月除应领工资外，实行倒三七分红（工七、资三），资方无利可图，便无心经营，买卖越干越没劲。土地法大纲及中央局保护工商业政策公布后，该厂随着根据“劳资两利”的工资原则进行了五天讨论，检讨了过去缺点，订出新的工资标准及今后经营方针与各种制度，双方都积极起来，三个月即造出与出售了弹花弓二十辆、水车六辆、和其他不少农具。最近又租了五间房，新购旋床一座，积极修建内部，扩大生产。民生铁工厂民主讨论好增资后，工人增加夜工赶制成品。该厂于最近包做了公家一千个缧丝钉，要在十天内交齐，但厂内只有两盘火，一盘要做弹花弓零件，只有一盘火供做缧丝钉，十天内只出货七百多个，完成不了任务。厂主随即召开全厂工人会议，研究提前完成办法，工人自动提出增加夜班，为不误白天工作，决定每夜有四人轮流上工，到电灯熄时止，这样每夜可出三十个，每个工人可多挣工资五百二十五元。又光华电灯公司自实行工人选派代表参加工厂管委会，及工人经过一月的学习后，阶级觉悟空前提高，工作积极性和创造性也大大增加。技师杨树春自动减少每月工资白面六十斤，除白天工作外还加夜班，并和工人一同研究以麻籽油加肥皂、松香泡，代替汽缸油，克服了有钱也很难买到汽缸油的困难；又以棉线绳代替鸡毛绳及自制一切零件，替厂方节省了开支。修机房技师王芝琴除修理机器外，自动挤出时间出外作活，增加公司收入，去冬至今春共挣洋五十余万元。烧火工人每天比过去节省了炭五百斤，还保证不减少气压数。
