　　How was the Deviation Corrected in Dianyao Village, Yangcheng?
　　Dianyao Village in Yangcheng is a village in the old liberated area where land reform was relatively thorough. After rent reduction, speaking bitterness, revenge, and land reform, the feudal system no longer existed, and new and old middle peasants accounted for more than 80% of the village's households. However, last year, after the county deployed to take the "route of relying on poor peasants," Guo Xiaobao, the organization committee member of the branch, and Zhang Zhiyi, the branch secretary, used administrative orders to organize a poor peasant association, forcibly sought out feudalism and hard struggles, seriously damaging the interests of the middle peasants. The landlords and rich peasants who had been struggled against were swept out of their homes, and 22 households in the village were placed under house arrest. People were beaten and hung up at random, causing panic throughout the village, with everyone feeling insecure.
　　At the end of March, the county convened a meeting of village cadres, criticizing the mistake of infringing on the middle peasants and prohibiting the development of all chaotic phenomena. Soon after, district cadres went to Dianyao to correct the deviation. At this time, the county government's announcement also arrived in the village, and the newspapers were read every day in winter school. The villagers discussed: "Middle peasants should not be infringed upon," "Laborers should not suffer losses, and losses must be compensated!" However, the district cadres did not delve into the masses when they arrived in the village, but only stayed with the village cadres. Based on the opinions of the village cadres, they classified the 22 households under control as one landlord household, eight rich peasant households, twelve middle peasant households, and one poor peasant household. Using administrative power, they held a mass meeting, announced the cancellation of house arrest, and spoke about the policy without considering the actual situation of the village, considering the problem solved. Indeed, after the meeting, the mood of the masses began to stabilize on the surface, and the enthusiasm for production also increased (just in time for sowing). Therefore, the village cadres believed that the problem was solved, "Look, production has greatly increased!" The district cadres also believed that the deviation had been basically corrected. But the fact was not that simple. Xiaobao and his gang were still resisting in their minds. Although they admitted their mistakes at the meeting, they only said vaguely, "We were wrong before," without making specific self-criticisms. Moreover, they left a loophole when explaining the policy. For example, Xiaobao said at the meeting: "Opening the door now is for production. When we review in the autumn, things will be the same!" He also said: "Everyone cannot only listen to what the newspapers say. The main thing is to look at the masses, and know that policies are dead, but methods are alive." The masses were still uneasy: "Opening our doors for production is just to reassure us!" "It doesn't count if we still have to do it in the autumn!" Such a simple and hasty approach, without going deep into the masses, only looking at one side, and only listening to the reflections of the village cadres to correct the deviation, resulted in the old deviations not being thoroughly corrected, and new "leftist" rash errors occurred. For example, the day after the door of middle peasant Zhang Yuanshui was opened, Zhang Yubao, the chairman of the farmers' association, and others went to "borrow grain." Subsequently, nine households went to "borrow grain," borrowing a total of two dan and four dou. At this time, Li Mintang, the county party secretary, personally led a work team to Dianyao. The cadres and party members felt strange and said: "It has already been corrected, why do we need to correct it again?" The middle peasants, on the other hand, greeted us with smiles and said: "The doors have been opened, and the control has been lifted. Very good!" They didn't want to say anything deeper.
　　The work team, on the one hand, went deep to understand the ideological situation of the masses, and on the other hand, convened a branch meeting to let the branch report on the situation in the village, combining the two to avoid only listening to one-sided reflections and not being able to understand the true and comprehensive situation. At the branch meeting and the village cadre meeting, the village cadres showed four different attitudes: One, represented by Xiaobao, the cadre in power, was an attitude of resistance, and was unwilling to report at all. When serious matters below were mentioned, he would push it away, saying: "I don't know." The second, represented by branch secretary Zhang Zhiyi, was to cover up mistakes and emphasize the "sins" of the households under control, saying that they were "transferring property" or "eating and drinking extravagantly," and was unwilling to talk about serious facts such as beating people and forcing people to death. However, he spoke with great interest about the individual good phenomena after the deviation was corrected. The third, represented by Zhang Yubao, chairman of the farmers' association, was to minimize responsibility, saying: "The beatings were not serious, only beaten once." "There was no house arrest, only some boxes and grain were sealed." "I borrowed grain voluntarily, only borrowed one dou," and so on. The fourth, represented by village chief Li Yong (who had a bit of a retaliatory attitude towards Xiaobao and others because he did not participate in the poor peasant association last year) and public security director Zhang Qiuwu, were dissatisfied with Xiaobao's and Zhiyi's attitudes, interjected a few cold words, questioned a few sentences, and exposed some real situations. After the meeting, the work team also had individual talks with some village cadres, and at the same time, conducted in-depth interviews with the masses to collect information. The next day, a village-wide branch meeting was held to mobilize. Comrade Li Mintang first used the facts initially understood to explain the policy and explain the danger of "leftist" reckless actions. Then, he pointed out that the past deviation correction in Dianyao was not thorough, and that some cadres and party members were resisting, openly criticizing Xiaobao's arbitrary and reckless actions. Finally, he also made a self-criticism, saying that the county's deployment of winter production last year to take the route of relying on poor and hired peasants, not lending to middle peasants, and the general slogan of "investigating feudalism" without regard to the actual specific situation were all wrong, and the county should be responsible. He pointed out: "Today, the main thing is to clarify what is wrong and what is right. We should not blame each other or shirk responsibility. We must correct what is wrong." After this mobilization and individual education, most of the cadres in the branch and the poor peasant association accepted the party's correct policy and began to criticize and expose their own mistakes and the mistakes of others; but it was not profound enough. Only a few people like Xiaobao were still resisting or taking a negative attitude.
　　Then, all the village cadres in the village, whether they had transformed well or not, were organized into five groups together with the work team, and distributed to five villages to work. The village cadres who were dissatisfied with the "leftist" rash actions in the past and had transformed relatively well with higher awareness were used as the backbone to jointly lead the deviation correction work; those who had not transformed or had transformed poorly were also absorbed to participate, and strive to transform and educate them in the actual work of deviation correction.
　　In each village, the work team first divided the cadres into several parts and carried out the following tasks: (1) Go deep into the masses, combine with reality, publicize the party's policies, and understand the true intentions of the masses. And combine to solve individual practical problems. The methods are individual talks, farmers' association meetings, hired peasant association meetings, mass meetings, etc. (2) In addition to participating in general mass activities, party members also hold separate party member meetings to specifically understand the situation and solve their ideological problems. (3) Specifically, individually visit the masses who have sealed doors and households under control to understand their door-sealing situation and reasons, and clarify their class components.
　　In the process of carrying out the above three tasks, it was found that the broad masses of the people were very much in favor of our party's policies. The general middle peasants who were not sealed and struggled against last winter did not dare to talk to us at first, but later said: "Our Communist Party's policy does not harm the working people. The reckless actions last winter were wrong!" "I was afraid last winter! Now this is right." What they were most dissatisfied with was hanging and beating people. The general poor peasants also felt that the reckless actions last winter were wrong, making it impossible for us to even borrow things, and also agreed to correct the deviation. The middle peasant households who had their doors sealed wanted to approach the work team, but they also had concerns. After slowly understanding our policies, they told the truth. In general, the first step was to complain about injustice, the second step was to talk about what was lost, and then to say that there were a few bad ideas in the village. In general, they were not exaggerating and were very careful, only afraid of saying something wrong again and making mistakes. The work team patiently studied the middle peasants who had their doors sealed and determined that out of the 22 households, there was only one landlord household, one rich peasant household, one poor peasant household, and sixteen middle peasant households. There were three households whose final determination of whether they were rich peasants or middle peasants had not yet been made.
　　At this point, the work team compared the information learned from the masses with the information learned from the party members, poor peasants, and village cadres, and then began the second step of the work, deciding to first hold meetings of party members and poor and hired peasants in each village to further combine with reality and explain the party's policies, especially using the fact that the middle peasants still wanted to get close to the Communist Party after being struggled against to open up their thinking. After this meeting, everyone said: "If this happened to ourselves, we couldn't bear it either." In this way, everyone more deeply reviewed their own mistakes and actively demanded to immediately correct past mistakes.
　　Then, with the village as the unit, farmers' association member meetings were convened one after another to specifically discuss the issue of compensating the middle peasants for their losses. Because most of the cadres had straightened out their thinking, they were very sincere in their self-criticisms. Seeing that the cadres had all made self-criticisms, the masses were also truly willing to return the things of the middle peasants; those who really couldn't afford to compensate were helped to solve the problem through mass discussion and from the public fruits. The third step of the work was to convene mass meetings in the villages to publicly admit mistakes and compensate for losses. The middle peasants who did not suffer much loss in the struggle initially said: "Not only did you not clearly draw the line, but I myself did not clearly draw the line. Because my ancestors had exploitation, I was afraid of investigating myself when investigating classes. Now it is good to draw the line. If it is really impossible to return, it can be not returned." However, those who had suffered more from being beaten were inevitably unhappy and complained publicly about their grievances. They were very dissatisfied with Xiaobao, saying: "I get a stomachache as soon as I see Xiaobao coming!" The old man Zhang Zhongxing didn't finish complaining. Other middle peasants stood up and said: "The beatings have already happened, and the people who beat have already admitted their mistakes. Can you turn around and beat them again? This is not revenge!" At this time, the leaders once again admitted their mistakes, allowing everyone to shout out the grievances that had been suppressed in their hearts. They also explained the responsibilities, so that not only the people who complained about injustice felt relieved, but also others felt relieved and satisfied. Guo Yuansheng, a middle peasant who had been struggled against, said in public: "We are all farmers. You don't understand the policy, and I don't understand it either. Now that the door is open and the things have been returned, I have no opinion. It is good to be able to correct mistakes. Now some people in the village have no food to eat. I still have eighteen or nineteen dan of grain, and I can't finish eating it. I am willing to take out ten dan and lend it to everyone to eat, and they can return it to me after the wheat harvest or the autumn harvest." In this way, the atmosphere of the meeting completely changed. Everyone said: "Are you still afraid!" He said: "I am serious." Everyone's faces were filled with smiles, and they dispersed from the meeting "happily."
　　Each village held such a "unity meeting" and elected representatives, bringing things and sending them to the middle peasants' homes one by one. Seven village cadres and representatives from Houzhuang Village took grain, quilts, clothes... and went to the home of the old man Pi Xing. As soon as they entered the door, they saw the old man making a big pot of "mi qi". Before the representatives had time to apologize and admit their mistakes, a large bowl of rice was brought to each person, and they were asked to eat with smiling faces. The representatives refused, but they couldn't refuse, so they ate a meal together. His second daughter-in-law said happily: "The policy is very good (meaning very good). We have to produce even if we don't sleep." A total of 33 dan of grain, 189 pieces of clothing and quilts, 12 bolts of cloth, 36 pieces of farm implements, 4 head of livestock, and more than 100 jin of cotton have been returned from the things confiscated from the middle peasants in the village.

### 阳城殿腰村是怎样纠偏的？

　　阳城殿腰村是怎样纠偏的？
    阳城殿腰村是老区土改比较彻底的村子，经过双减、诉苦、复仇、土地改革，封建制度已不存在，新旧中农占全村户数百分之八十以上。但去年在县上布置走“雇贫路线”后，支部组织委员郭小保、支部书记张治义，用行政命令组织了贫农团，硬找封建硬斗争，严重的伤害了中农利益，把斗争过的地主富农扫地出门了，全村封门管制了二十二户，并乱打乱吊人，闹得全村恐慌，人人自危。
    三月底，县召开了村干会议，批判了侵犯中农的错误，并禁止一切混乱现象的发展。以后不久，区干部到了殿腰去纠偏，这时县政府的布告也到村了，报纸也在冬学中天天读，村里大家议论着：“中农不该侵犯”，“不能亏劳动人，损失了要赔偿！”但区干部到村并没深入到群众中去，只停在村干部中，并根据村干部意见，把被管制的二十二户的成份划成地主一户，富农八户，中农十二户，贫农一户，用行政力量，开了个群众大会，宣布了取消封门管制，不联系本村实际情况的讲了一下政策，即算解决了问题。的确，会后表面上群众情绪开始安定，生产劲头也大了（正是下种）。于是村干部认为问题解决了，“你看生产劲大了！”区干部也认为纠偏已基本上解决了问题。可是事实并不是这样简单，小保们一伙伙，思想上还在抵抗，虽然在大会上也承认了错误，可是只囫囵的说：“以前错了”，并没有具体检讨。而且解释政策时，又留了个尾巴。如小保在大会上说：“现在开门是为了生产，秋后复查时，该怎样还是怎样！”还说：“大家不能只听报上说的，主要的要看群众，要知道政策是死的，办法是活的。”群众思想仍然不安：“为生产开咱的门，是安咱的心哩！”“秋后还要搞不算话！”生产也是无可奈何，许多话没说，许多问题没解决。这样简单草率，不深入群众，只看片面，只听村干部的反映去纠偏，结果旧的偏向还没彻底纠正，新的左倾蛮干的错误又发生了。如头一天开了中农张元水的门，第二天农会主席张玉保等，就去“借粮”，接着有九家先后都去“借粮”，共借出二石四斗。这时，县委书记李敏唐亲自带一个工作组到了殿腰，干部和党员感到奇怪地说：“已经纠过了，怎么又要纠？”中农呢，见面一脸笑，应付我们，说：“门也开了，管制也取消了，很好！”再不往深处说。
    工作组一方面深入了解群众思想情况，一面召开支部会议，让支部汇报村里的情况，把两者结合起来免得只听片面反映，而不能了解真实全面情况。在支部会上、村干部会上，村干部表现了四种不同的态度：一种以小保为代表的掌权干部，是抵抗的态度，根本不愿汇报，提到下面较严重的事情，就推说：“不知道”。另一种以支书张治义为代表，是掩饰错误，强调被封门户的“罪过”，不是说人家“转移财产”，便是“大吃二喝”，不大愿意说打人逼死人等严重的事实，而对纠偏后个别好的现象，则讲的津津有味。第三种以农会主席张玉宝为代表，是尽量减轻责任。说：“打人并不严重，只打了一次。”“又没封门，只封了一些箱子和粮食。”“我借粮是自愿的，只借了一斗”等。第四种以村长李永＠（因去年没参加贫农团，对小保等有点报复情绪）、公安主任张秋武为代表，他们对小保的和治义的态度不满，插上说几句冷话，质问上几句，并揭发了一些真实情况。会后，工作组又找某些村干作个别谈话，同时深入访问群众，收集情况。第二天开全村支部大会进行动员。李敏堂同志首先拿初步了解的事实，解释了政策，说明左倾瞎干的危险。接着，他提出殿腰过去纠偏还不彻底，干部党员有人抵抗，公开批评了小保的独断独行，左倾瞎干。最后还作了自我检讨，说县上去年布置冬季生产，要走贫雇路线，不贷款给中农，笼统的不按实际具体情况提出“查封建”的口号，这都是错误的，县上应当负责。并指出：“今天主要应弄清什么错什么对，不应互相埋怨，推诿责任，错的咱们大家就一定要纠正。”经过这一动员及个别教育后，支部及贫农团中大部分干部，接受了党的正确政策，开始对自己错了的，别人错了的，加以批评揭发；可是还不深刻。只有象小保等少数人，仍在抵抗或采取消极态度。
    接着便将本村无论转变好的或未转变的村干部，都与工作组一块，组织成五个小组，分到五个庄上去工作，对过去即不满左倾蛮干、转变较好觉悟较高的本村村干部，都作为骨干，共同领导纠偏工作；旁的没转变或转变较差的，也吸收他们参加，在纠偏的实际工作中，争取改造教育他们。
    工作组在各庄，第一步先将干部分成几部分，进行下列几项工作：（一）深入群众，结合实际，宣传党的政策，了解群众的真心实意。并结合解决个别实际问题。方法是个别谈，开农会员会，开雇贫农会，开群众会等。（二）党员除参加一般群众的活动外，另开党员会议，专门了解情况，解决他们的思想问题。（三）专门个别访问群众中封门户、管制户，了解他们封门情况及原因，弄清他们的成份。
    在进行上述三项工作中，发现广大群众对我党政策非常赞成。去冬没被封门斗争的一般中农，开始不敢与我们讲什么，后来就说：“咱共产党的政策就不亏劳动人，去年冬天瞎干，就不对哩！”“去年冬就怕着哩！现在这就对了。”他们顶不满意的是吊人打人。一般贫农也觉得去冬瞎干不对，闹的咱连东西也借不出来，也赞成纠偏。被封门的中农户，又想接近工作组，又有顾虑，等到慢慢把我们政策摸透了以后，才说出知心话。一般的第一步是先诉冤，第二步才说丢了什东西，再说村中有几个人出坏主意，一般的不夸大，很小心的，只怕再说错了又出差错。工作组耐心的研究了被封门的中农，确定廿二户中只有一户地主，一户富农，一户贫农，十六户中农，有三户还未最后决定是富农还是中农。
    至此，工作组把从群众中了解的情况和从党员贫农、村干中了解的对照起来，即开始第二步工作，决定先分头在各庄开党员和贫雇的会议，进一步结合实际，再说明党的政策，特别以中农被斗后，仍然想向共产党靠近的事实，来打通思想。经过这个会，大家说：“要是把这事搁到自己头上，咱自己也受不了吧。”这样大家都更深入的检讨自己的错误，并积极要求立即纠正过去错误。
    接着便以庄为单位，先后召开农会会员大会，具体讨论赔偿中农损失问题。由于大多数干部思想弄通了，检讨时很诚心诚意。群众见干部都检讨了，所以也都真心情愿退还中农的东西；真正赔不起的，则经过群众讨论，从公共果实中帮助解决。第三步工作是分庄召开群众大会，公开承认错误，赔偿损失，被斗中农里面吃亏不大的，开始便说：“不只你们没划清界线，我自己也没划清界线，因我上辈有剥削，一查阶级，自己就怕查自己，现在划清了就好，真没办法退的，也可不退。”可是过去被打吃苦头较重的，就难免心气不平，当众诉开冤屈了。他们对小保很不满意，说：“我一见小保来了就肚痛！”老汉张中兴诉着诉着就没有完了。其他中农起来说：“打已经打了，打的人也已经认错啦，你还能翻过来再打他们一顿，这不成了报复性啦！”这时领导上又再次认错，让大家将积压在心中冤气喊出来。又说明责任，这样不只诉冤屈的人心气慢慢平了，就是其他人也感到气顺了，满意了。被斗中农郭元盛当众提出：“咱都是农民，你们不了解政策，我也不了解，现在开了门，又退了东西，我没意见，错了能改就好，现在庄上有些人没吃，我还有十八九石粮，吃不完，情愿拿出十石借给大家吃，麦收或秋收后再还我。”这样，会场的空气完全变了个样子，大家说：“你不是还害怕吧！”他说：“我这是真的。”大家脸上都露出了笑容，“圪喜喜”的散会了。
    各庄都开了这样的“团结会”，并推举了代表，带上东西，一家一家的给中农送，后庄村干和代表七个人，拿上粮食、被子、衣服…………第一个到丕兴老汉家里，一进门见老汉做了一大锅“米其”，代表们还没来得及道歉认错，每一个人面前就端来一大碗饭，满面笑容让大家吃饭，代表们推让不过，就一块吃了一顿。他二媳妇高兴的说：“政策飞好（多好的意思），咱不睡觉，也要生产。”全村没收中农的东西，已退还的计有粮食三十三石。衣服、被子一百八九件，布十二匹，农具三十六件，牲口四头，棉花一百余斤。（太岳分社）
