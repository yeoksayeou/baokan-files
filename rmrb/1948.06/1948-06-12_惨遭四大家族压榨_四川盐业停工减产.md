Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. According to a report from Chongqing in the Shanghai News: The Sichuan salt industry, subjected to layers of exploitation by the bureaucratic capital of the Four Big Families, has mostly fallen into a state of suspended work and reduced production. Of the 28 salt fields in Sichuan, by March of this year, more than half of the well and stove-operating households had been forced to stop drawing water and cease firing their stoves, resulting in a sharp reduction in output by one-third. Even the stove-wells that are still struggling to maintain operations are in a precarious state. The Chiang gang employs various methods of exploitation against the salt workers, such as the so-called "difference returned to the public," whereby the Chiang family's salt affairs authorities arbitrarily set salt prices. Merchants buy at these prices and transport the salt from the producing areas to the selling areas. Then, the Chiang family's salt affairs authorities pay the merchants the set salt price plus 18 percent interest and some so-called "legitimate profits." The salt is then stored in "official warehouses" and sold at high prices after adding salt taxes. The difference in price is entirely plundered by the bureaucratic capital. Taking the situation in Wutongqiao, southern Sichuan, in January of this year as an example: the Chiang authorities stipulated that each "yin" (200 jin) of salt be purchased from the stove operators at a low price of 35 million Chiang coins, and then sold at a high price of 83 million Chiang coins. After deducting the actual income of 42 percent for the producers and a small amount for the merchants, about half of the selling price was pocketed exclusively by the bureaucratic capital. At the same time, the Chiang authorities also used the name of "pre-assessed salt price" to determine the cost of salt production for the following month based on the commodity price index of the previous month, and arbitrarily lowered the index increase for salt prices. For example, in June of last year, the average commodity price rose by more than 200 percent, while the Chiang authorities stipulated that the price of salt purchased from salt merchants in July would only increase by 72 percent. The Chiang authorities also changed the "monopoly policy" to the so-called "free production and transportation" from January of last year, further intensifying exploitation. They stipulated that merchants purchasing salt from field operators should only pay 30 percent in cash, with the remaining 70 percent handled by the "syndicate" controlled by the merchants and the Chiang gang through "exchange settlement." However, with prices constantly rising, the syndicate froze the salt payments. The amount for January of last year was delayed and not paid. The salt payments from November of last year onwards were only paid in six or seven installments until February of this year, causing the field operators to suffer heavy losses of their capital.

　　惨遭四大家族压榨
  　四川盐业停工减产
    【新华社陕北七日电】据沪报载重庆讯：受四大家族官僚资本层层压榨的四川盐业，大多数已陷于停工减产的境地。全川廿八家盐场，至今年三月间，已有一半以上井户灶户被迫停水停火，产量锐减三分之一。即目前尚在勉强维持的灶井，也朝不保夕。蒋帮对盐民剥削方式多种多样，如所谓“差价归公”，即由蒋家盐务当局，随意规定盐价，运商照价购买，从产区运到销区后，再由蒋家盐务当局根据所定盐价加百分之十八利息及若干所谓“合法利润”，付予运商，即将盐存入“官仓”，加上盐税高价出售，其间差价，全为官僚资本掠夺。以今年一月份川南五通桥情形为例：蒋当局规定该地每引（每引二百斤）盐以蒋币三千五百万元的低价向灶商买进，再以八千三百万元的高价卖出，除去生产者实际所得百分之四十二及运商少量所得外，售价一半左右为官僚资本所独吞。同时蒋当局又以“预核盐价”名义，以上月物价指数来规定下月盐产成本，且任意压低盐价应增指数，如去年六月份，平均物价涨百分之二百以上，而蒋当局规定七月份向盐商购盐价格，仅增加百分之七十二。蒋当局并于去年一月份起，改变“专卖政策”为所谓“自由产运”，作更进一步的剥削，规定运商向场商购盐，只缴三成现款，其余七成由运商和蒋帮掌握的“银团”办理“押汇”，由“银团”付款给场商。但在物价不断上涨下脱，银团却将盐款冻结，在去年一月份的数目，拖延不付，去年十一月份以后的盐款，直到今年二月才分六、七次付给，致场商血本遭受惨重损失。
