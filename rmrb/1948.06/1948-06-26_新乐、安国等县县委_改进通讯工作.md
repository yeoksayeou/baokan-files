[Jizhong News] The Xinle, Anguo, Raoyang, and Renqiu county party committees have been paying attention to improving communication work. During the expanded cadre meetings, they conducted special reviews and studies, deciding to strengthen the organization and leadership. When the Xinle County Party Committee studied this issue at the production meeting, it pointed out that the communication and reporting work has somewhat declined since February and March, compared to November, December, and January. The reasons are: First, there is a lack of sound organization and leadership, without regular discussions, research, supervision, and control, so the communication groups gradually collapsed. Second, some comrades do not pay attention to the Party newspaper, thinking that writing or not writing articles does not matter. Third, some comrades wrote articles but they were not published, so they became discouraged and stopped writing. Fourth, the leadership did not provide good help and guidance to the enthusiastic worker-peasant correspondents. The County Party Committee decided to quickly restore and improve the communication organizations at the county, district, and sub-district levels. The County Party Committee Propaganda Department and the District Party Committee Propaganda Committee (or a district committee member designated if there is no propaganda committee) must regularly contact and guide the communication groups and core correspondents, compile monthly statistics on稿件, and evaluate the results, giving praise and criticism. The meeting also specifically determined the reporting focus based on the county's work and the different situations in various regions. The Anguo, Raoyang, and Renqiu county party committees pointed out at the expanded cadre meetings that communication work has progressed in recent months, but because the leadership has not paid close enough attention to this work and some comrades do not attach enough importance to it, there are still many shortcomings in communication work. They should quickly restore and improve the communication organizations and strengthen leadership in this work.

　　新乐、安国等县县委
  　改进通讯工作
    【冀中讯】新乐、安国、饶阳、任邱等县县委注意改进通讯工作，在召开扩干会的时候，都作了专门的检讨与研究，决定健全组织加强领导。新乐县委在生产会议上研究这个问题时指出：通讯报导工作自二、三月份以来，比十一、十二、一月份有某种退步。其原因：第一是缺乏健全的组织和领导，没有经常的讨论研究和督促掌握，因此通讯小组慢慢的垮了台。第二是有些同志对党报不重视，认为写不写稿不要紧。第三是有些同志写了稿没登出来，因此便灰心丧气不写了。第四是领导上对写稿热心的工农通讯员没有很好帮助和领导。县委决定应很快的恢复和健全县、区、小区的通讯组织，县委宣传部、区委宣传委员（没宣传委员的，指定一个区委负责）。要经常对通讯组、骨干通讯员进行连系和指导，每月要做稿件统计，评定成绩好坏，给以表扬与批评。会上并根据本县工作和各地区不同情况，具体确定了报导重点。安国、饶阳、任邱县委在扩干会上分别指出，近几个月来通讯工作都有进展，但由于领导上对这个工作抓的还不够紧，有些同志也不够重视，因此通讯工作还有不少缺点，应迅速恢复与健全通讯组织，加强对此工作的领导。
