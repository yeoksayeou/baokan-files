Taiyue News: The Jincun, Quwo base point work group, in leading the masses in the summer harvest and summer planting, initially dispelled the masses' ideological concerns about past mutual aid groups, and successfully reorganized mutual aid, completing the wheat harvest task. At the beginning, the general poor and hired peasants felt that since they had only recently been emancipated, they had difficulties with farm tools and livestock, and requested help in resolving these issues. However, because the mutual aid groups were forcibly organized by past village cadres and did not adhere to the principle of equivalent exchange, households with labor and livestock suffered great losses. Therefore, at the mention of using mutual aid to solve difficulties, everyone was afraid. Middle peasant Wei Fu-ying said: "I am willing to be sent to cut wheat, but don't mention mutual aid again." Poor peasants were also dissatisfied with the past mutual aid groups. Li Xiao-chou planted a whole autumn of land for others last year and has not yet received his wages. Therefore, everyone felt that mutual aid was a waste of work and it was better to work independently. Furthermore, because the work group's work in these two months was detached from the masses' production, with too many meetings, the masses were afraid that mutual aid would lead to constant meetings, delaying production instead. The work group, village cadres, and mass representatives discussed and studied, believing that to solve these problems, it was necessary to correct deviations in production, emphasizing that mutual aid was a voluntary combination, with the freedom to withdraw, equivalent exchange, and not allowing those with livestock to work for nothing. After such publicity and discussion, the masses' mood began to change. Li Cheng-tu said: "As long as it is fair and reasonable, mutual aid will be faster with more people, who wouldn't be willing!" After everyone grasped the principles of voluntarism and equivalent exchange, they learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, and those with difficulties also joined the mutual aid groups. Chen Cheng-qun is blind, but he has livestock and a cart. Zhang Tang-zi has no livestock but has labor. Chang Lin-chi has labor, but incomplete farm tools. The three families voluntarily combined into one group, with two carts, two livestock, and four laborers, and each family's difficulties were resolved. In this way, 52 mutual aid groups were formed in the whole village. Military dependents also participated and exchanged labor in the same way as everyone else, and landlords and rich peasants were also absorbed, asking them to work together. From the fourth of this month, the whole village universally began harvesting, and after it rained on the sixth, they harvested and planted at the same time. By the fourteenth, more than 3,000 mu of wheat had been harvested, and more than 1,000 mu of reclaimed land had also been planted. Yang Xing-you happily said: "Mutual aid is really good, there are no problems in my group." But judging from the current situation, issues such as equivalent exchange and work-point calculation in these groups have not been completely resolved. For example, Wang Yi-ping said: "Our group doesn't need to calculate work points. We are either relatives or fellow villagers, how can we bring it up? Anyway, the meat rots in the pot, the rice rots in the soup, there's not much difference between taking a loss and getting a bargain." This method does not conform to the principle of fairness and reasonability, and it will inevitably collapse after a long time. Now the work group is helping to sort out and summarize the experiences of the better mutual aid groups, in order to universally educate and improve them, so that mutual aid can be well sustained.

　　曲沃靳庄群众互助完成麦收
    【太岳讯】曲沃靳庄基点工作组，在领导群众夏收夏种中，初步解除了群众对过去互助组的思想顾虑，很好的重新组织了互助，完成了麦收任务。开始时一般贫雇农因翻身不久，农具牲口都感困难，要求帮助解决。但因互助组是过去村干部强编成的，也不合等价交换的原则，使有劳力和有牲口的户吃了大亏，所以一提到用互助办法解决困难时，大家就害怕，中农卫福瑛说：“要派我割麦我情愿去，就是再不要提互助”。贫农对过去的互助组也不满意，李小丑去年给别人种了一秋天地，还没收到工资。因此，大家认为互助是白搭工，不如各干各的。又因为工作组这两月工作与群众生产脱节，开会太多，群众又怕互助起来，整天开会，反倒耽误生产。工作组和村干部、群众代表讨论研究，认为要解决这些问题，必须在生产中纠偏，强调提出互助是自愿结合，可以自由退出，等价交换，不能使有牲口的白搭工。经过这样宣传讨论以后，群众情绪开始转变，李成土说：“只要公平合理，互助起来人多手快，谁还不愿意！”大家掌握了自愿和等价交换的原则后，取长补短，有困难的人也参加了互助组。陈成群是个瞎子，但他有牲口和车，张唐子没牲口有劳力，常林池有劳力，但农具不全，三家就自愿结合为一个小组，有两辆车，两个牲口，四个劳力，各家困难都解决了。这样，全村就组成了五十二个互助小组，军干属也都参加和大家同样变工，并且吸收了地主富农，叫他们一起劳动。从本月四日全村普遍开始收割，六日下雨后，一面割一面种，到十四日三千多亩麦子割完，要回＠的一千多亩地也种上了。杨兴有高兴的说：“互助起来真好，我这组没有一点问题。”但就现在情况看来，这些组的等价交换和记工折工等问题，还没有完全解决，如王一平说：“咱这组不用记工，不是亲戚就是老乡，怎好开口？反正肉烂在锅里，米烂在汤里，吃亏便宜没多大意思。”这种办法不合公平合理的原则，日子一久必然垮台，现在工作组对较好的互助组正帮助整理总结经验，以便普遍教育提高，使互助能很好的坚持下去。
