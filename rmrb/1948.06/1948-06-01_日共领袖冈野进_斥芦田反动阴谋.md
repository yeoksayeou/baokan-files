　　JCP Leader Okano Susumu
　　Condemns Ashida's Reactionary Conspiracy
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th -- Tokyo News: JCP leader Nozaka Tetsu (i.e., Okano Susumu) made an interpellation speech in the House of Representatives on the 22nd, denouncing Ashida Hitoshi's conspiracy to exclude communists from public institutions. Nozaka Tetsu pointed out that this issue has international importance because it violates the Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Constitution and aims to undermine the main principles of democracy. JCP spokesperson Ito Tsuyo, in another statement on the same day, denounced Ashida's conspiracy as intending to "consolidate the power of monopoly capital," and stated that this kind of "Nazi-style legislation" will "lead the Japanese nation to destruction." It is reported that Ashida's reactionary plan was submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on the 20th.
