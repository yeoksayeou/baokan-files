　　【Taihang News】 Cadres in Zhehu Village, Ninth District of Xingtai, participated in an enlarged cadre meeting in the district. Cadres and party members overcame ideological confusion and actively led the masses to correct deviations, achieving unity among all classes for production.

　　After the correction, the production enthusiasm of all classes was high. During the rush to harvest wheat and sow seeds, the whole village presented a new atmosphere. The Production Committee prepared two red flags to reward model teams in order to complete the wheat harvest and sowing ahead of schedule in a timely manner. On the evening of the second day of the fifth lunar month, a mass meeting was held to mobilize all men, women, and children in the village to urgently rush to plant and harvest. All labor was organized, with women, children, and the elderly cutting wheat, male semi-laborers carrying it, and male full-laborers sowing seeds. The twelve mutual aid teams launched a challenge for wheat harvesting and sowing in order to compete for the red flag. Team leader Yin Youku calculated the manpower and animal power of the entire team and proposed to complete the wheat sowing in three days, guaranteeing that all women would go to the fields, and challenged Jin Changyun's team. Jin Changyun said, "Whenever you finish cutting, we will finish cutting too." Tongyi challenged Wang Jinquan, saying excitedly, "If you can't complete the wheat harvesting and sowing in three days, our whole team will play trumpets to celebrate your team." Hero Li Shunhua said to Jin Changyun, "If you can't complete the wheat harvesting and sowing in three days, we will carry the red flag to your team." After a heated challenge, the whole village organized 110 male full-laborers, 43 male semi-laborers, 135 female full-laborers, 21 female semi-laborers, 61 children, 46 donkeys, 4 mules, and 32 oxen. All teams acted collectively and completed the wheat harvesting and sowing in four days. A total of 550 mu of wheat were harvested and 470 mu were sown. Jin Changyun's team had male laborers carrying fertilizer and planting, while women and children cut wheat. Li Junfang's family had 20 people, and she got up at the fifth watch every day to cook. She also led 14 women in the team to cut 21 mu of wheat in two and a half days. Guo Jiuni's team landlord Li Chouni was resettled and participated in wheat cutting without even taking a break. Women cadres Li Fuzhi and Li Hunni led seven women to finish cutting wheat and planting land for military families first, and then did their own team's work. Yin Youni's team had a clear division of labor, with children specifically assigned to look after the children every day. On the third day of the fifth lunar month, nine women cut three mu. Yuan Dewen and Li Erren led eleven women to cut nineteen mu on the third day. Women Chun Jingzi and others helped men pull the "Huozi" to plant twelve mu of land. Elementary school children's corps Li Tingxiang, Jin Lianfa, and others led six groups in the whole school, a total of 64 people, to cut 65 mu of wheat. Girl Jin Lianfa led a group of 16 people to cut 21.5 mu of wheat in three days. They all used "shang" tickets.

　　The characteristics of this wheat harvesting and sowing in Zhehu Village are: first, the Production Committee grasped it tightly and achieved unified leadership; second, each cadre and party member went deep into a team and played a leading role; third, women, children, and livestock were treated equally and fairly, without any losses to each other; fourth, timely broadcasts were made every evening, praising typical teams and typical people; fifth, each team planned the next day's farm work every night, and the work squad leader was responsible for arranging work and assigning people. The Production Committee is studying the next stage of agricultural tasks, mainly hoeing the spring millet and King Queen jade corn for the second time. The remaining labor in each team is engaged in sideline occupations, carrying shoulder poles, and women are turning to spinning. Each team is hoeing seedlings on one hand and conducting evaluations of merit on the other hand, promoting the next stage of agricultural work.

　　邢台折虎村干带头展开竞赛
  　组织各阶层麦收下种
    【太行讯】邢台九区折虎村干部们在区里参加了全区干部扩大会议，干部党员克服了思想上的混乱，积极领导群众纠偏，达到各阶层团结生产。
    纠偏后，各阶层生产情绪高涨。在突击麦收下种中，全村呈现新的气象。生产委员会为了及时提前完成麦收下种，准备了两面红旗来奖励模范组。阴历五月初二晚上召开群众大会，动员全村男女老少，紧急抢种抢收。把一切劳力组织起来，妇女儿童和老头割麦，男半劳力担，男整劳力下种。十二个互助组为了争红旗，掀起了麦收下种挑战。组长尹有库计算了一下全组人畜力，提出要三天完成麦子下种，并保证妇女全部下地，向靳昌运组挑战。靳昌运说：“你们啥时割完，俺也啥时割完。”。同义给王进全挑战，起劲的说：“三天完不成麦收下种，俺全组吹喇叭庆贺你组。”英雄李顺华给靳昌运说：“三天完不成麦收下种，把红旗扛给你组。”经过热烈挑战，全村组织起男整劳力一百一十个，男半劳力四十三个，女整劳力一百三十五个，女半劳力廿一个，儿童六十一人，驴四十六头，骡四头，牛三十二头。各组都集体行动，四天即完成了麦收下种。计共割麦五百五十亩，下种四百七十亩。靳昌运组男劳力担肥种地，妇女儿童割麦。妇女李俊芳家里二十人，她每天起五更做饭。并领导全组十四个妇女，两天半割麦二十一亩。郭九妮组地主李臭妮得到安置，参加割麦时连歇也不歇。妇女干部李富知、李混妮领导七个妇女，先给军属割完麦，种完地，再干自己组的活。尹有妮组分工很明确，每天有专门看小孩的儿童。五月初三一天，九个妇女割了三亩。苑得文、李二仁领导十一个妇女，初三一天割了十九亩。妇女春景子等帮男人拉“霍子”种地十二亩。小学儿童团李廷祥、靳连法等领导全校六个组共六十四人，割麦六十五亩。女生靳连法领导一个组十六人，三天割麦二十一亩半。他们都使用了垧票。
    折虎村这次麦收下种的特点，一是生产委员会抓的紧，做到了统一领导。二是每个干部党员深入一个组，起了带头作用。三是妇女、儿童、牲畜作到等价公道，互不吃亏。四是每天晚上及时广播，表扬典型组、典型人。五是各组每晚计划第二天农活，拨工队长负责排活分人。生产委员会研究下一段的农务，主要是锄二遍春谷和金皇后玉茭。各组余出劳力搞副业、担扁担，妇女转入纺织。各组一面锄苗，一面进行评功，推动下段农活。
