　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd: The local armed forces and militia of Xiangning County, southwestern Shanxi Province, completely annihilated the remnants of enemy soldiers led by Xie Xichang, deputy brigade commander of the 30th Brigade escaping from Linfen, at Longwangmiao in the northeast of the county on May 20th. Over ten enemies were killed or wounded, and Xie Xichang and more than one hundred and thirty others were captured, and all weapons were seized. The Jin Sui Military Region issued a special circular to commend them.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 3rd: After the liberation of Linfen, the Yan bandits in central Shanxi were extremely panicked. Schools in Taiyuan City have been suspended, and all students, businessmen, and civil servants have been forced to participate in the construction of the airport in the southeast corner of the city. The Yan army in Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and other places is rapidly concentrating in the Taiyuan and Yuci areas. The families of Yan bandit officials in various places are also moving to Taiyuan, and each person is ordered to carry at least two months' worth of food. There is a severe shortage of food in Taiyuan, and millet is selling for 200,000 yuan per pound in Chiang currency. Soldiers are limited to 12 liang of rice per person per day. Taiyuan has strictly checked household registrations and tightly closed the city gates. The enemies in Jiexiu, Fenyang, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, and other places are even more panicked because they are close to the liberated areas. They have hastily withdrawn from the Renzhai stronghold in the east of Fenyang City into the city. The Yian Village and other strongholds are often startled several times a night, ringing bells for help in the middle of the night. The bandits who used to go out to plunder on weekdays now shrink back to their strongholds before lunch and dare not stay outside for long. In order to build fortifications and accumulate food, the enemy in Jiaocheng is not only grabbing laborers outside the city but also driving old, weak, and women out of the city. In contrast to the panic of the reactionaries, the people in central Shanxi are spreading the news that "it's coming soon" and are eager for the People's Liberation Army to come and rescue them.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: The Jinbei Front Command of the North China People's Liberation Army has recently announced the detailed battle results of the liberation of Ying County City on May 25th: A total of 2,420 enemies were annihilated, including 2,307 killed or wounded, and 113 captured. The following weapons were seized: 57 light machine guns, 30 grenade launchers, 3 rifle grenade launchers, 2 submachine guns, 211 rifles and carbines, 1,103 grenade launcher shells, 5,366 hand grenades, and 250,000 rounds of various bullets.

　　乡宁地武歼灭临汾逃敌百余
  　擒蒋匪副旅长谢锡昌
    晋中匪极慌乱纷纷龟缩太原
    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋西南乡宁县地方武装及民兵，五月二十日在该县东北的龙王庙，全部歼灭临汾逃敌三十旅副旅长谢锡昌所率之残部，计毙伤敌十余名，俘谢锡昌以下一百三十余名，缴获全部武器。晋绥军区特予通令表扬。
    【新华社晋绥三日电】临汾解放后，晋中一带阎匪惊慌万状。太原市各学校已停课，所有学生、商人、公务人员，均被强迫参加修筑城内东南角之飞机场。汾（阳）孝（义）等地阎军，迅向太原、榆次一带集中。各地阎匪官员家属，亦纷向太原迁移，并命令每人至少须携带两个月的食粮。现太原粮食奇缺，小米每斤售价蒋币二十万元，士兵食米每人每日限定十二两。太原已严查户口，紧闭城门。介休、汾阳、文水、交城等地之敌，因靠近解放区而更形惊慌，已将汾阳城东之仁砦据点仓惶撤回城内，义安村等据点，常一夕数惊，半夜打钟求救。平日外出抢掠之匪，午饭前即缩回据点，不敢在外久留。交城敌为构筑工事和积蓄食粮，一面在城外抓丁，一面将城内老弱妇女赶出城外。和反动派的惊慌相反，晋中人民则纷纷传播着“快来了”的消息，渴望解放军快去解救他们。
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】华北人民解放军晋北前线指挥部，顷发表五月二十五日解放军事要点应县城的详细战果：共歼敌二千四百二十名，内毙伤二千三百零七名，俘一百一十三名，缴获轻机枪五十七挺，掷弹筒三十个，枪榴筒三个，冲锋机枪二支，长短枪二百十一支，掷弹筒弹一千一百零三枚，手榴弹五千三百六十六枚，各种子弹二十五万发。
