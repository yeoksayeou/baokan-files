[Taiyue News] The Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee and Fourth Administrative Office of the Chinese Communist Party have jointly issued a circular criticizing the bureaucratic style of leadership in Jiyuan County and District, and their neglect of disaster relief work. Relief grain allocated was not promptly distributed to starving people, or was distributed equally, failing to achieve the desired effect. The spring famine in Jiyuan is widespread and severe. According to statistics from several villages, out of 2,898 households, only 270 households will have food until the wheat harvest. The remaining 2,231 households have no or insufficient grain and urgently need relief. The Administrative Office and Prefectural Office have successively issued 3,600 *shi* of relief grain and 60 million yuan in loans. Together with the county's local grain relief, the total is nearly 10,000 *shi* of grain. It was distributed to the county in March, but on May 19th, the Prefectural Office received a report from the Seventh District of Jiyuan on May 8th stating that the relief work in four villages of the district was only "in the process of providing relief." In Liu Village of the Third and Sixth Districts, the relief grain was withheld in the village office and not distributed. Even when it was distributed, it was done so equally, without focused use, resulting in minimal effect. For example, in the Second and Fifth Districts, each person received five or eight *jin*. In the Fourth District, each person received three *jin*. In Hanzhuang, out of 64 households, only one household received ten *jin* of grain, while the rest received four or five *jin*. The disaster in Zhao Ge of the Seventh District is also severe, but the village has accumulated public fruits worth 650,000 yuan, seven *shi* of grain, 62 pieces of clothing, 520 *jin* of cotton, eight *liang* of silver, and 300 *jin* of silver dollars, all sitting idle while people starve to death. In Panzhuang administrative village and Gaozhuang natural village in the First District, the relief grain was used for school education expenses, leading to the serious phenomenon of people begging for food and starving to death. However, Jiyuan County has not yet submitted a comprehensive report to the Prefectural Office. This shows that the county leadership does not value disaster relief work and only makes arrangements without in-depth, meticulous, and widespread inspection and supervision. Jiyuan County's failure to effectively provide relief with such a large amount of relief grain is a serious mistake, indicating serious bureaucracy and a lack of responsibility towards the people on the part of the county and district leadership. The Jiyuan County Committee should continue to conduct in-depth investigations, promptly submit reports, and immediately and thoroughly correct this.

　　济源领导上官僚主义
  　忽视救灾造成恶果
    【太岳消息】中共太岳四地委四专署顷发出联合通报批评济源县区领导的官僚主义，忽视救灾工作。发下的救济粮，没有及时的发到饥民手里，或者采用了平均分配的办法，没有得到应有的效果。济源春荒普遍严重，据几个村的统计二千八百九十八户中，只有二百七十户能吃到麦收，其余二千二百三十一户都是无粮或缺粮户，急须救济。行署专署先后发出救济粮三千六百石，贷款六千万元，连同该县地方粮的救济，总计粮食将近一万石。三月份就发到县里，五月十九日，专署接到济源七区五月八日救灾工作汇报，全区四个村的救济粮现在才“正在救济中”，三、六区柳村将救济粮扣在村公所不发；就是发下去的，也采取了平均分配的办法，没有有重点的使用，效果很小。如二、五区每人分配五斤或八斤。四区每人三斤。韩庄六十四户，只有一户领到十斤粮，其余都是四、五斤。七区赵圪＠的灾荒也很严重，但全村积存的公共果实大洋六十五万元，粮食七石，衣服六十二件，棉花五百廿斤，银子八两，银元三百斤，都放着不动，看着把人饿死。一区潘庄行政村，高庄自然村，把救济粮当作学校教育经费开支了，以致发生有要饭的和饿死人的严重现象，但济源县直到现在未向专署作一次全面报告。这说明了县的领导上，对救灾工作不重视，只有布置，没有深入细致普遍检查督促。济源县拿了这样大批救济粮，不能很好的来救济，是一个严重的错误，说明县区领导上有严重的官僚主义，缺乏对人民负责的态度。济源县委应继续作深入检查完迅速汇报，并立即坚决彻底纠正。
