Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: Yan'an University's Luochuan Branch has opened. Half of the students are intellectual youths from the Kuomintang-controlled areas who, unable to bear the Kuomintang's persecution, have traveled long distances through many dangers to seek refuge in the liberated areas. To adapt to this situation, the school has extended the enrollment examination period and implemented a "take the exam upon arrival" system, so that the continuous stream of youths arriving later can enroll in a timely manner. Students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas have an extremely strong desire to absorb revolutionary knowledge, especially regarding Chairman Mao's works. Some bury themselves in reading from early morning, and continue to discuss them enthusiastically during meals and breaks. The school's principal, Mr. Li Mingren, said that in view of the students' extremely high enthusiasm for learning revolutionary knowledge, before formally starting classes, the branch school will first study Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," as well as "The Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and "The Outline Land Law of China." The learning method mainly relies on students' free reading, with students first raising questions, linking them to the current situation and specific work, and展开discussing them. Then, teachers will synthesize the discussion and answer various questions. Also, Luochuan Middle School reopened at the end of May. Gao Chengzhai, former principal of Mizhi Middle School, is now the temporary principal of the school. The original teachers of the school in Luochuan, our government welcomes him to continue teaching. When Hu Zongnan's troops fled, the school suffered serious damage, with more than 40 school buildings burned down, and most of the books and instruments destroyed. After the liberation of Luochuan, our side immediately sent people to protect it, and convened the Luochuan Middle School Resumption Preparatory Committee. It was decided that students' tuition, accommodation, and miscellaneous fees would be waived, with only meals, clothing, books, and stationery to be provided by the students themselves. Students from poor families will receive subsidies or full supplies from the school upon government verification of their circumstances. Graduates are free to choose their careers, and those who wish to participate in revolutionary work will be introduced to appropriate jobs by the government.

　　延大洛川分校开学
  　半数学生来自蒋管区
  　热心研读毛主席著作
    【新华社西北廿三日电】延安大学洛川分校已开学。学生中半数系来自国民党统治区的知识青年，他们因不堪国民党迫害，故历经重重艰险远道找奔解放区。为适应此种情况，该校已延长入学考期，实行随到随考制度，使以后络绎而来的青年能及时入学。来自国民党统治区的学生，对吸取革命知识的要求极为强烈，尤其是对毛主席著作最为爱好。有些人于一清早起来就埋头阅读，吃饭休息，仍在热烈讨论。使该校校长李明仁先生谈，鉴于同学中学习革命知识的情绪极高，分校在未正式开课前，首先读毛主席的“目前形势和我们的任务”、“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”及“中国人民解放军宣言”、“中国土地法大纲”等文献。学习方法，主要依靠学生自由阅读，先由学生提出问题，联系目前时局及具体工作，展开讨论，然后由教员加以综合，并解答各种疑问。又讯：洛川中学已于五月底开学上课。曾任米脂中学校长之高成斋、现任该校临时校长，原该校留洛教员，我政府又欢迎他继续留任执教。胡宗南军逃窜时，该校曾受严重摧残，校舍被烧四十余间，图书仪器大部被捣毁。洛川解放后，我方立即派人保护，并召开洛中复学筹委会，当决定对学生之学费、住宿费及杂费等一律免收，仅膳食、衣服、书籍、文具由学生自备，家境贫苦者经政府证明证实后，由学校酌情补助或全部供给。学生毕业后自由择业，其愿参加革命工作者，由政府介绍适当工作。
