　　Reversing the Tendency of Simply Rectifying Deviations
  　Xiyang Strengthens Production Leadership
    [Xiyang News] Xiyang County, from top to bottom, has reversed the tendency of simply rectifying deviations and neglecting production. It has urged various districts to increase the number of cadres leading production from the previous two or four to eight or ten, and to systematically shift some experimental villages with severe famine to self-salvation through production. It has also convened village cadre meetings three times in each district to repeatedly study policies, allowing village cadres and party members to put down their ideological baggage, and calling on party members and cadres to transform themselves in the leadership of production. After the third meeting, village cadres and party members dispelled their ideological concerns. Returning to their villages, they universally publicized the Party's policies, and began to improve the relationship between the Party and the masses. Compensation was given to some wrongly struggled middle peasants, and some landlords and rich peasants were resettled. Other middle peasants began to feel at ease, saying, "As long as we are not called 'accumulating households' for things we earned through labor, and are not struggled against as feudal elements, we won't dare to only hoe our hearts and not the edges of the fields like we did last year!" Poor peasants also said, "The fruits of distribution are limited and can only provide a foundation. If we want a major turnaround, we must have large-scale production!" In short, Xiyang correctly implemented the Party's policies and stimulated the peasants' enthusiasm for production. According to materials from various villages, in addition to cultivating the existing arable land, statistics from sixty-six villages show that 6,527.4 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, including 4,562.2 mu of raw wasteland and 1,965.2 mu of fallow wasteland. In addition, 150.06 mu of beach land have been repaired, and 4,382.2 zhang of embankments have been built in thirty-three villages. Seven villages have expanded 171.8 mu of embankment land, and another village has newly built over 100 mu of irrigated land. In terms of sideline production, fifty-three villages reported weaving 5,806 chi of cloth; thirty-three villages spun 4,742.12 jin of yarn in January; thirty-seven villages earned 10,026,620 yuan from transportation; small workshops in thirty villages earned 4,161,500 yuan; and other small-scale production earned 1,237,000 yuan. In addition, thirty villages boiled 5,765 jin of saltpeter, earning 52,682 jin of rice, of which twenty-four villages earned 4,068,000 yuan from digging medicinal herbs; five villages earned 3,636,500 yuan from mining; small vendors in three villages earned 131,000 yuan; and thirteen other villages raised 67 silkworm egg sheets. In order to further promote the county's production work, the county has organized production work groups to go deep into key areas, absorb experience, and combine with cadres leading production in various districts to further carry out the county's large-scale production movement.

    【昔阳消息】昔阳县自上而下的扭转了单纯纠偏，忽视生产的偏向，督促各区把领导生至产的干部由过去两个四个增加到八个到十个，有计划的将一些灾荒严重的实验村，转向生产自救。并在各区召开了三次村干会议，反复学习政策，使村干党员放下思想包袱，号召党员干部在领导生产中改造自己。第三次会议后，村干党员解除了思想顾虑，回到村里，普遍宣传了党的政策，开始改善了党群关系。补偿了部分错斗的中农和安置了一些地主富农，其他中农开始安心了，他们说：“只要不说自己劳动来的东西，也是圪堆户，按封建斗争，咱今年可不能象去年一样锄地光锄地心，不敢锄地头地边了！”贫农们也说：“分果实有限，只能打个底，要想大翻身，还得大生产！”总之，昔阳正确执行了党的政策，启发了农民的生产积极性。据各村材料，除了耕种原有的耕地以外，六十六个村的统计，已开荒六千五百二十七亩四分，其中生荒四千五百六十二亩二分，熟荒一千九百六十五亩二分，另外修滩地一百五十亩零六分，三十三个垒＠四千三百八十二丈二尺；七个村展堰地一百七十一亩八分，另一个村新修水浇地一百多亩。副业生产上，五十三个村统计织布五千八百零六尺；卅三个村，一月间纺线四千七百四十二斤十二两；三十七个村运输赚钱一千零二万六千六百二十元；三十个村的小作坊赚钱四百一十六万一千五百元，其他小生产赚钱一百二十三万七千元。另卅个村熬硝五千七百六十五斤，赚米五万二千六百八十二斤，其中二十四个村刨药材又赚钱四百零六万八千多元；五个村开山赚钱三百六十三万六千五百元；三个村的小商贩赚钱十三万一千元，另有十三个村，养蚕六十七席。县里为了把全县生产工作进一步搞起来，已组织了生产工作组，深入各重点，吸收经验，结合各区领导生产的干部，进一步开展全县的大生产运动。
