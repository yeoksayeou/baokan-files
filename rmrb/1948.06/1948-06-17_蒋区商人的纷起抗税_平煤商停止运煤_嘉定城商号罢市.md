Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, merchants in areas such as Peiping and Tianjin, unable to bear the Kuomintang's harsh taxes and levies, are rising up in resistance. Last month, the coal industry in Peiping stated that coal merchants were already suffering from various taxes and levies such as business tax, and firmly opposed the "coal donation" that the Chiang Kai-shek Finance Bureau of the city stipulated to be levied from May 1st. However, on the 13th of last month, the Kuomintang authorities dispatched a large number of police officers to block coal-transporting carts and forcibly collect coal donations, leading to conflicts. By the 23rd, coal merchants had stopped transporting coal to show their protest. The Tianjin business community demanded the cancellation of the method of "income tax for this year being calculated at six times that of last year," but was rejected by the Kuomintang authorities. At the end of last month, they again demanded that this method be modified. On the 14th of last month, business firms in Qingdao also sent eleven representatives to petition the Kuomintang authorities, demanding a reduction in harsh taxes. On the 6th of last month, businesses in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, unanimously went on strike, resisting the increasingly heavy harsh taxes and levies of the Kuomintang.

　　蒋区商人的纷起抗税
  　平煤商停止运煤
  　嘉定城商号罢市
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据蒋区报纸消息平津等地商人因不堪蒋党苛税压榨，纷起抗争。上月中北平煤炭业表示煤商原已遭受营业税等各种捐税的勒索，坚决反对请市蒋记财政局规定于五月一日起开征的“煤炭捐”，但蒋当局上月十三日竞出动大批警察拦阻运煤大车，强收煤捐，致引起冲突，至二十三日煤商均停止运煤以示抗议。天津商界要求取消“本年度所得税按上年度六倍计缴”的办法，遭蒋当局拒绝后，上月底再度要求修改该项办法。青岛各业商号亦于上月十四日推派代表十一人向蒋当局请愿，要求减少苛捐。江苏嘉定县全城商号曾于上月六日一致罢市，反抗蒋党日益加重的苛税勒索。
