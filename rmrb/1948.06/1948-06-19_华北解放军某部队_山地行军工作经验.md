Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: It is difficult for plain troops to enter mountainous areas for combat. If the leadership does not prepare in advance to overcome these difficulties, it will inevitably reduce the morale and combat effectiveness of the troops. In March and April of this year, a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army marched towards Chahar, paying attention to overcoming these difficulties and creating a lot of experience in mountain marching. A comprehensive introduction is as follows:

　　The troops set out in early March, marching in the mountains for about ten days. Many soldiers were entering the mountains for the first time in their lives, and some units were marching and fighting in the mountains for the first time. The area passed through was rugged, with sparse villages, crossing steep mountains and rapid streams. Large-scale troop movements often required camping, and it snowed for several days. Many people (nearly half in some units) got blisters on their feet, but they all successfully completed the marching task. Moreover, compared with previous battles, the morale of the troops was high, the cadres were more responsible, desertion was reduced, civilian labor was saved, and discipline was good.

　　Start the Battle Mobilization
　　Explain the Mission of Mountain Marching and Combat
　　
As soon as the troops started the battle mobilization, explaining the mission of mountain marching and combat, a competition upsurge was immediately set off. Various slogans appeared on challenges, merit plans, and revenge oaths. Some proposed "Four Nos" - no falling behind, no desertion, no getting sick, no violating discipline. Some wrote "Six Fear Nots" - not afraid of walking mountain roads, not afraid of mountain combat, not afraid of long marches, not afraid of being far from home, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of continuous combat. Some companies made victory flags, model plaques, and glory flowers, which were decided by the masses every day, and which class to give it to. Class friendship and mutual assistance were also widely developed. For example, explaining problems to comrades with low morale, treating comrades with blisters, and helping weak comrades carry things. 805 people from × Brigade ×× Regiment participated in this kind of mutual assistance. Many liberated soldiers said with emotion: "The People's Liberation Army is so friendly. In the Kuomintang, no one cares even if you are exhausted." In some units, marching entertainment work was very active. Daily marching newsletters were published, slogans and cartoons were written on the roadside, and mobilization sheds were set up to mobilize village pupils to sing and dance to welcome the troops passing by. Some used paper clips to draw several ghost faces (Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Fu Zuoyi, etc.), and put them on to make a "fool" of themselves when the troops were resting or climbing mountains. There were also shadow plays, whistling, passing flowers, bumping balls, and ditties (a kind of fast talk). Among them, ditties were the most popular among soldiers, who composed and sang them while walking.

　　Cadres' Love for Soldiers
　　Help Soldiers Study and Solve Problems
　　
The cadres' love for soldiers was significantly demonstrated. For example, cadres of the Political Department of × Brigade went down to the companies to march and sleep with the soldiers, helping to study and solve problems. Doctors from the brigade's health department also went to the companies to help with their work. Comrade Ma Long, commander of × Brigade, carried a machine gun for the soldiers and climbed over two mountain tops, influencing the soldiers so that none fell behind. It was even more common for cadres to let the sick ride horses and carry things for the soldiers themselves. Once, during a bivouac, a certain company was only assigned two rooms, one for the kitchen and the other for the squad to live in. The squad let the company headquarters live in it, and the company headquarters wrote a letter to let the regimental leaders live in it. The regimental leaders replied to let the sick live in it. Such mutual concern, care, and unity between superiors and subordinates made the troops even more consolidated. For example, in a certain brigade, 43 out of 53 units had no desertions. In a certain regiment under its jurisdiction, the entire regiment had no desertions. Although the number of desertions in a certain column was relatively large, there were also 107 units with no desertions, a decrease of two-fifths in the desertion rate compared to the autumn offensive in northern Daqing River, and a decrease of one-half in the desertion rate compared to the Baobei Campaign.

　　In terms of civilian labor mobilization, the average reduction was two-thirds. A certain unit reduced from 14 large military vehicles in the past to one large cart and three donkeys. The camp staff prepared water, fodder, and kerosene in advance as soon as they arrived at the residence, avoiding everyone looking for them temporarily. In the past, some units asked the villagers to carry water and cut grass, but this was also corrected this time.

　　High Class Consciousness After Military Reorganization
　　Formed a New Revolutionary Heroism

　　The main reason for obtaining the above achievements is that before the march, the troops carried out a new type of military reorganization of venting grievances and conducting three investigations, as well as democratic movements to transform branches, evaluate party members, and evaluate cadres. The troops' class consciousness has been raised unprecedentedly, forming a new revolutionary heroism. The concrete manifestation is the high mood and requirements of revenge and meritorious service. But how to guide this kind of emotion and requirement, and implement it into the specific work of striving for each battle victory, that is the task of each battle mobilization work. The experience of the Northeast troops is to launch discussions on the guiding ideology and requirements of the battle among the soldiers and lower-level cadres before the battle begins, so as to turn it into the thoughts and requirements of the masses, thereby encouraging fighting spirit and promoting the spirit of daring to win. The advance of the Jin-Chahar-Hebei troops into southern Chahar this time also proved this experience. The ×× Regiment's marching work summary pointed out: Political work must trust the masses. Without affecting confidentiality, tell the masses as much as possible about the necessary public issues, so that the masses can understand the important meaning of the task, and don't be afraid to tell the masses about the inevitable difficulties, so that the masses can fully brew, consciously mobilize each other to find ways, and then formulate concrete plans or conventions that meet the ideas and requirements of the battle (such as "Four Nos", "Six Fear Nots"), hold revenge and meritorious service oaths, and launch mutual assistance and competition. This approach enables all the work in each battle to be truly based on the conscious foundation of the masses, so the masses have the enthusiasm and determination to strive for victory in the battle, so as not to be blind or passively inactive.

　　The Role of the Soldiers' Committee is Great
　　Guaranteed the Contact Between the Leadership and the Masses

　　After the guiding ideology and requirements of the battle become the thoughts and requirements of the masses, thereby generating the enthusiasm of the masses (this is the material force that plays a decisive role in striving for each battle victory), what else should political work do? At this time, it lies in how to very effectively exert the role of this enthusiasm to every specific work in the battle action. At the same time, we must cherish the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and must use it very sparingly and effectively, and do not waste the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses indefinitely on some unimportant events, which will cause the masses' emotions to be low, bored, and even exhausted. Wasting the enthusiasm of the masses is as wrong as wasting bullets in the military. We must cherish and effectively use the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and constantly improve the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in regular work, so as to maintain the fullness of the masses' emotions. On this issue, some troops are solving it through the organizational form of the Soldiers' Committee. × Brigade pointed out in the summary of the work experience of the Soldiers' Committee that the Soldiers' Committee played a great role in the march. For example: the economic committee members of the Soldiers' Committee personally helped the kitchen chop firewood, fetch water, and study how to improve the food. During the march, they called on everyone to help the cooks carry things, so that the cooks' emotions were always full, and the food was well cooked; the entertainment committee members made motivational small flags such as "Marching Model" and used cartoons, ditties, broadcasts and other methods to carry out motivational work; the wall newspaper committee members published express reports every day, and handed in the manuscripts as soon as they arrived at the camp. The content included paintings, songs, riddles, commendations, and criticisms. Every time they were posted, everyone scrambled to see their own affairs; the discipline inspection committee members inspected the discipline of the masses at any time (wartime inspected the discipline of the battlefield); the meritorious service committee members grasped the meritorious heroes. Whenever the company received a new task, it would hold a meeting of meritorious heroes to launch a meritorious service competition. As soon as the task was completed, meritorious service would be evaluated immediately; the military and political research committee members frequently raised questions based on different situations and mobilized everyone to discuss them. For example, when a certain unit attacked Guangling, the military and political research committee members raised the question of how to get the heavy machine gun to the roof quickly? How to block the enemy's blockhouse? Mobilized everyone to discuss. Especially in ensuring the contact between the leadership and the masses and in the struggle against bad tendencies during the march, the Soldiers' Committee played a great role.

### 华北解放军某部队　山地行军工作经验

　　华北解放军某部队
  　山地行军工作经验
    【新华社陕北十六日电】平原部队进入山岳地带作战，是有许多困难需要克服的。领导上如果事先没有准备去克服这些困难，那就不可避免地要降低部队的情绪和战斗力。本年三、四月间，华北解放军某部队向察哈尔进军，还注意了克服这种困难，并在山岳地带的行军工作中创造了很多经验。兹综合介绍如下：
    部队于三月上旬出发，经十天左右山地行军。许多战士是平生第一次进山，有的单位是初次到山地行军作战。所经地带，道路崎岖，村落稀少，翻峻岭，越急流，大兵团行动，时需露营，且遇到下了几天雪。很多人（有的单位将近半数的人）脚上打泡，但均胜利完成行军任务。且比以往历次战役，部队情绪高涨，干部更加负责，逃亡减少，民力节约，纪律也好。
  　开始战役动员
  　说明山地行军作战任务
    部队开始战役动员，说明了山地行军作战任务，便立即掀起竞赛热潮。多种多样的口号，出现在挑战、立功计划及复仇宣誓书上。有的提出“四不”——不掉队、不逃亡、不生病、不犯纪律。有的写着“六不怕”——不怕走山路，不怕山地作战，不怕长行军，不怕离家远，不怕吃苦，不怕连续作战。有的连队制出优胜旗，模范牌，光荣花，每天经过群众表决，该给哪班就给哪班。阶级的友爱互助，也普遍展开。如向情绪不高的同志解释问题，给打了泡的同志治疗，帮助体弱同志背东西。×旅××团有八百零五人参加此种互助。不少解放战士感动的说：“解放军真友爱，国民党那边，累死也没人管。”有的单位，行军娱乐工作十分活跃，每日出版行军快报，书写路旁标语漫画，设鼓动棚，动员乡村小学生唱歌、跳舞欢迎部队路过。有的用纸夹画好几张鬼脸（蒋介石、宋美龄、傅作义等），当部队休息或爬山时，就戴上出“洋相”。还有拉洋片、吹哨、传花、碰球、顺口溜（一种快板）等。其中顺口溜最受战士欢迎，边走边编，边唱边走。
    干部的爱兵精神
    帮助战士研究解决问题
    干部的爱兵精神，有显著表现。例如×旅政治部干部，下连队与战士一起行军睡觉，帮助研究解决问题。旅卫生处医生，也到连队帮助工作。×旅旅长马龙同志，替战士扛机枪，爬过两个山头，影响战士一个也不掉队。干部有马让病号骑，自己还替战士背东西的更为普遍。有一次宿营，某连只分到两间房子，一间给伙房，另一间让班上住，班上都让连部住，连部便写信让团首长住，团首长又答复让病号住。上下之间，如此互相关心，爱护与团结，因而部队更加巩固。如某旅五十三个单位，四十三个单位没有逃亡，所属某团，全团无一逃亡。某纵队逃亡数虽较多，亦有一零七个单位没有发生逃亡，比去秋出击大清河北减少五分之二的逃亡率，比保北战役则减少二分之一的逃亡率。
    民力动员方面，平均减少三分之二。某部由过去十四辆大军，减少为一辆大车又三头毛驴。设营人员每到住地，都先准备好水、草料、灯油，避免了大家临时乱找。过去有的单位要老乡挑水、铡草，此次也被纠正。
    整军后阶级觉悟高
    形成了革命新英雄主义
    以上成绩之获得，主要原因是由于在行军之前，部队进行了诉苦和三查的新式整军，以及改造支部，评党员，评干部的民主运动。部队阶级觉悟空前提高，形成了革命部队的新英雄主义。其具体表现，就是复仇立功的高度情绪和要求。但如何引导此种情绪和要求，贯彻到争取每个战役胜利的具体工作中去，那就是每次战役动员工作的任务。东北部队的经验，是在战役开始之前，将战役指导思想与要求，在战士及下级干部中展开讨论，使其变为群众的思想与要求，由此鼓励斗志，发扬敢于胜利的精神。此次晋察冀部队进军察南，也证明了这一经验。××旅行军工作总结这样指出：政治工作要相信群众，在不影响机密的条件下，尽量把必要公开的问题告诉群众，让群众了解任务的重要意义，而且不要害怕把必然遇到的困难告诉群众，让群众充分的酝酿，自觉地互相动员想办法，进而订出具体的合乎战役思想与要求的各种计划或公约（例如“四不”，“六不怕”），举行复仇立功宣誓及展开互助和竞赛。这种做法，就使每一战役中的一切工作，都真正建立在群众自觉的基础之上，因而群众就有了为争取战役胜利的热情和决心，才不致盲目或消极被动。
    士兵委员会作用大
    保证了领导与群众联系
    在战役指导思想和要求变为群众的思想和要求因而产生群众的积极性之后（这是争取每个战役胜利起决定作用的物质力量），政治工作还应做些什么呢？这时，就在于如何很有效地发挥这种积极性的作用到战役行动中的每一件具体工作上去。同时，又必须十分宝贵群众的热情和积极性，必须十分节省地使用和有效地使用，而不要在一些不重要的事件上无限制地去浪费群众的热情和积极性，因而就要引起群众情绪的低落，厌烦以致疲蹋。浪费群众的热情，和军事上浪费子弹一样，是很错误的。必须宝贵和有效使用群众热情与积极性，并在经常工作中不断去提高群众热情与积极性，才能经常保持群众情绪的饱满。关于这个问题，有些部队是通过士兵委员会这种组织形式来解决的。×旅在总结士兵委员会工作经验中，指出士兵委员会在行军中起了很大作用。例如：士兵委员会的经济委员亲自帮助伙房劈柴、打水，研究改善伙食，行军中号召大家帮助炊事班背东西，使炊事班情绪始终饱满，饭菜做的都好；文娱委员制“行军模范”等鼓动小旗及使用漫画、顺口溜、广播等方法进行鼓动工作；墙报委员每天出快报，一到宿营地就汇报交稿，内容有画、歌谜、表扬、批评，每次贴出，大家争先恐后看自己的事；纪律检查委员，随时检查群众纪律（战时检查战场纪律）；立功委员掌握功臣，连里接到每一新的任务，就召开功臣会，发动立功竞赛，任务完成，立即评功；军政研究委员根据不同情况，经常提出问题发动大家讨论，如某部攻广灵时，军政研究委员提出怎样使重机枪上房迅速？怎样封锁敌人炮楼？发动大家讨论。尤其在保证领导与群众联系及在行军中反对不良倾向等斗争上，士兵委员会都起了很大的作用。
