　　[Jinan News] Daming City resolutely implements the policy on industry and commerce, and after returning the businesses that were struggled against, merchants have actively expanded their businesses. Before the return, some people doubted whether they would be truly returned, and some said: "Other places may be able to return them, but it is not certain here." Shopkeeper Tian of Yihe Xing Pharmacy was happy after receiving the returned shop, saying, "Except for the Eighth Route Army, who else could do this?" (referring to being able to correct mistakes). He was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night, planning how to expand his business. Other merchants are also planning to expand their operations. Some people took out the old stock that they had hidden in the past and registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau. In less than half a month, they registered tubes of colors, 1,125 tubes, and packages of colors, 1,250 packages, which are now displayed on the shelves for free sale. The market has added 21 stationary businesses, including 9 grocery stores, 2 cotton-fluffing workshops, 3 grain stores, 1 oil mill, 12 flour mills, 3 warehouses, and 1 tobacco shop. Some people are still vying to rent shops. Shopkeeper Dong of the rickshaw shop on South Street said, "Since the return of industry and commerce, I have been very busy, and I can't repair the cars that are brought in. I have received more than 20 cars just on South Street." Zhong Taichang Sauce Garden on West Street was returned to its original owner. The owner, manager, and employees united to expand their business without any hesitation. In the 20 days since the return, they have steeped 20 vats of vinegar (300 catties each), pressed 420 pieces of wheat koji (2 catties each), and produced more than 800 catties of soy sauce. Because the business is so busy, they called back a former employee. The owner, Cheng Xiangyan, used to not work, but now all three members of the father and son's family come to the store to take care of the storefront. The employees responded to the call to expand operations and actively produce to help accelerate business development. Now, merchants are preparing to take out large loans to purchase goods, and many are renovating their storefronts. The Daming market is gradually becoming more active.
    [Taiyue News] Wenxi resolutely returns the industry and commerce that was struggled against, and more than 700 escaped merchants returned in May. Last winter, Wenxi seriously infringed upon industry and commerce during the land reform, and merchants were quite panicked. Some were unwilling to operate, and some fled. Since the correction in April, the policy on industry and commerce has been resolutely implemented, and the industry and commerce that was struggled against has been returned. By the end of May, 67 businesses had been returned, including 7 grain stores, 20 oil mills, 11 pharmacies, 10 grocery stores, 9 flour mills, 1 dyeing shop, 1 vinegar shop, 4 carpenter shops, 3 inns, and 1 silver shop. Merchants have begun to settle down and resume and expand their businesses. More than 20 new businesses have been added in the city, and the market is thriving. This news quickly spread to the Jiang bandit area, and a large number of merchants who fled last year returned. In May alone, more than 700 merchants returned from Wu Yushuo.

　　作坊商店积极扩大营业
  　大名市面日趋活跃
    【冀南讯】大名市坚决执行工商业政策，退还被斗工商业后，商人们纷纷扩大营业。在没有退还以前，有些人还怀疑能否真正退还，有的说：别的地方能退还，咱这里就不一定。义合兴药栈田掌柜接收了退还的店铺，高兴的说：“除非八路军，谁能这样作？”（指有了不对能改）他喜欢的一夜没睡着觉，盘算如何扩大自己的营业。其他商人都同样计划扩大自己的经营，有些人把过去隐藏的陈货弄出来，纷纷到工商管理局登记，不到半月时间，就登记了成筒的颜色一一二五筒，成包的颜色一二五○包，现在都摆到货架上自由出卖，市面上增添了座商二十一家，计杂货铺九家、弹花坊两家、粮店三家、油房一家、粮坊十二家、货栈三家、烟丝店一家；有些人还在争着租寻铺面。南大街洋车铺董掌柜的说：“退还工商业以后，我实在忙的很，接的车子修不过来，光在南大街就接了二十多辆。”西大街众太昌酱园退还了原主，东家、经理、店员团结起来，毫无意思的扩大营业，自退还到现在二十多天，就淋了二十个醋（每个三百斤），榨麦曲四百二十块（每块二斤），出酱油八百余斤，因为买卖忙的顾不过来，把以前的一个店员又叫回来了。东家成相言，从前不劳动，现在父子三人都到店里来照顾门面。店员们响应扩大经营的号召，积极生产，帮助买卖加速发展。现在商人都准备大批贷款办货，整理门面的很多，大名市面逐渐走向活跃。
    【太岳讯】闻喜坚决退还被斗工商业，五月份已有七百多逃亡商人返回。去冬闻喜在土改中严重的侵犯了工商业，商人相当恐慌。有些无心经营，有些逃亡出去。四月份纠偏以来，坚决执行工商业政策，退还被斗工商业，到五月底已退还六十七家，内有粮店七家、油房二十家、药铺十一家、杂货铺十家、粉房九家、染房一家、醋房一家、木匠铺四户、客店三家、银楼一家，商人们开始安定下来，恢复扩展营业。城内商号很快增加了二十多家，市面繁荣起来。这消息很快传播到蒋匪区，去年逃亡的商人大批回来了，五月份只从吴玉说回来的商人，就有七百多。
