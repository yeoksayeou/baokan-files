　　【Licheng News】In Chengjiashan Village, Second District, the "poor and hired peasant group" was impure in the past. It abandoned the middle peasants, sidelined the cadres, and even formed hostility, making it impossible for the cadres to intervene. The middle peasants were afraid and did not feel at ease with production. The spring farming committee could not be established, and without leadership, spring plowing and sowing became a self-flowing decline. In order to correct the above deviations, the village summoned more than 20 honest middle and poor peasants on the night of May 13 to study their understanding of dissolving the impure poor and hired peasant groups. During the discussion, the middle and poor peasants all agreed to dissolve the impure poor and hired peasant groups. For example, the poor and hired peasant Cheng Xiaojiang said, "Dissolve it, then, if it's not dissolved, I'm still afraid of forcing people to death!" Cheng Niugun (poor and hired peasant) said, "What's the point of saying that? Not to mention the middle peasants, even the poor and hired peasants can't be united. I'm nominally a representative of the poor and hired peasants, but I don't know what kind of power I'm supposed to wield? How to wield it? A little kerosene spoils the whole pot of soup. It's better to dissolve it!" The middle peasant Jiao Panyang also said, "Once, this poor and hired peasant group asked us to provide labor. Our horse wouldn't eat grass, but they insisted we go. We didn't dare to say anything, so we had to go. Now that this kind of poor and hired peasant group is dissolved, we can feel at ease!" After this thinking was straightened out, the discussion then turned to spring plowing and sowing. It was unanimously agreed that it was appropriate to finish sowing millet before the Beginning of Summer (立夏). Therefore, on the second night, a village-wide meeting of middle and poor peasants was convened to discuss whether it was appropriate to sow after the Beginning of Summer and wait until Grain Full (小满). Liu Shenming said, "Millet sown at Grain Full is not as good as millet sown at the Beginning of Summer. The thunder came early this year, and the frost will definitely come early. As the old saying goes: people starve under the millet ear, if you sow late, the seeds won't mature and will be frosted. That's terrible, we can't wait until Grain Full!" Through detailed discussion, everyone realized that it was disadvantageous to sow late. It was estimated that out of 746 mu of millet land in the village, 184 mu had not been sown yet, and it was planned to finish sowing in six days of concentrated effort. Finally, people who consistently participated in labor and had experience were selected from each team to form a spring farming committee. There was more energy for production. For example, Deputy Village Head Guo Lian said, "To be honest, before this poor and hired peasant group was dissolved, I couldn't do anything. If you rely on the poor and hired peasant group, you can't rely on them; if you rely on the middle peasants, you don't dare to rely on them. It's really impossible; like now, how can we not lead production!" After the meeting, the team leaders are leading the effort to sow millet and prepare to plant corn.

　　程家山解散“贫雇组”
  　中贫农间解开圪＠
  　村干积极领导生产
    【黎城消息】二区程家山村，以前由于贫雇组不纯，扔掉中农，撇开干部，甚至形成仇视，弄得干部插不上手，中农害怕，不安心生产，春委会成立不起来，没有领导，致使春耕下种形成自流消沉。该村为了纠正以上各种偏向，遂于五月十三日夜召集了廿多个老实中贫农，研究对解散不纯的贫雇组的认识，在讨论中，中贫农都同意解散不纯的贫雇组，如贫雇程小江说：“解散就解散了吧，要不解散，还怕逼人命咧！”程牛群（贫雇）说：“可说那做甚哩，不用说中农，就连贫雇也团结不住，我应名是个贫雇代表，咱不知道是叫掌甚权？怎样掌？一点洋油坏了满锅汤，再不能比解散了合适！”中农焦泮阳也说：“有一次这贫雇组叫咱支差，咱的马不吃草，那非叫去不行，咱也不敢吭，就只好去。现在要把这种贫雇组解散了咱就安心啦！”这个思想弄通后，接着就讨论到春耕下种。一致认为立夏种完谷合适，于是在第二夜召集全村中贫农大会讨论立夏不种等小满合适不合适？刘申命说：“小满谷不如立夏老垧，今年开雷早，必定下霜早，古话说：谷穗底下饿死人，种迟了籽儿上不了就下了霜啦，可怕哩，可不敢再等小满啦！”由于详细讨论，大家都认识到种迟了吃亏。统计全村谷地七百四十六亩还有一百八十四亩没下种，预计要六天突击种完。最后按队选出一贯参加劳动有经验的人成立春委会。生产有了劲，如副村长郭联说：“说老实话吧，这个贫雇组没解散以前，咱就没法干，你说靠贫雇组吧，靠不住；靠中农吧，又不敢靠，真是没法；象现在这样还能领导不起生产来！”会后各队正领导突击种谷，准备栽玉茭。（黎城春耕小报）
