Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Comprehensive report: As the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hears testimony on the so-called "Mundt Bill," which is anti-communist, anti-democratic, and anti-third party, progressive forces in the United States have launched a powerful anti-Mundt Bill movement.

In the Senate Judiciary Committee, those who attended the hearing on the 28th to oppose the bill included American Communist leader Foster, as well as representatives from the Civil Rights Congress, the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, the National Lawyers Guild, the American Slav Congress, and other groups. The meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of growing opposition to the bill. American Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio denounced the bill at the meeting, saying it would create a "fascist legal system," and protested the short time allotted for testimony. A representative of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), a CIO union with more than 600,000 members, also condemned the bill at the meeting. A conservative AFL representative opposed declaring the Communist Party illegal "because this would not be in the best interests of the United States." A conservative representative of the American Civil Liberties Union also criticized the bill as unconstitutional.

Progressive groups across the United States have announced plans to march on Washington on June 2nd to demand more time for testimony and to oppose the Senate's conspiracy to rush the bill through. According to the Civil Rights Congress, black laborers, religious groups, and other progressive groups will participate in the June 2nd demonstration. At the same time, letters and telegrams protesting the bill are pouring in from all over the country. In a telegram to the Judiciary Committee, the Washington branch of the National Farmers Union denounced the bill as "unconstitutional" and said it would harm farmers' organizations. A meeting of 500 lawyers from the New York branch of the National Lawyers Guild also telegraphed the Judiciary Committee to oppose the bill. Committee Chairman Wiley admitted during the hearing process that in addition to the thousands of telegrams opposing the bill that had been received previously, the committee had recently received another 5,000 telegrams opposing it. According to the committee secretary, representatives of anti-Mundt Bill groups, numbering 4,000, requested time to testify against the bill, but the committee only planned to hear from a few people.

The so-called "Mundt Bill," originally named the "Subversive Activities Control Act," is also known as the "Mundt Bill" because it was proposed by Mundt, a notorious member of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Although the bill does not explicitly make the American Communist Party illegal, it declares on the one hand that "the American Communist Party is controlled by foreign powers," and on the other hand that "any group or individual who attempts in any way to establish a foreign-controlled proletarian dictatorship in the United States is an illegal offender, punishable by ten years in prison and a fine of $10,000, and will lose American citizenship." Therefore, it "will effectively make the American Communist Party illegal." (TASS) The bill also unreasonably requires "the American Communist Party and its peripheral organizations to submit annual reports of members and financial receipts and expenditures to the Department of Justice," and unreasonably "prohibits Communists from obtaining passports and holding government positions." In the United States today, where reactionaries are wantonly undermining the people's democratic rights, those whom this bill attempts to suppress are by no means limited to the Communist Party; they will use this reactionary bill to strike at any time against all those who are dissatisfied with the current reactionary policies of the United States. This is precisely why the anti-Mundt Bill movement has such a broad lineup.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS reports: American reactionaries continue to frantically persecute progressive groups. Attorney General Clark claimed on the 29th of last month that the so-called "Federal Loyalty Investigation Board" has only designated 32 groups as "subversive groups," including the "American Slav Congress," the "Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born," the "American Committee for Aid to Democratic Greece," and other progressive groups. Civil servants who participate in these groups will be dismissed on charges of "disloyalty."

　　美帝图谋疯狂镇压国内进步势力
  　全美掀起反蒙特法运动
    将于六月二日举行全国性示威进军
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：当美参院司法委员会对反共、反民主、反第三党的所谓“蒙特法案”听取证人举证之际，美国进步势力已发动了强有力的反蒙特法运动。
    在参院司法委会中，二十八日出席举证反对该案者，除美共领袖福斯特外，尚有民权保障大会、艺术科学与职业全国委员会、全国律师公会、美籍斯拉夫人大会等团体代表多人。会议于逐渐增长的反对该法案的气氛中进行。美工党议员马肯托尼奥在会上，斥责该案将创立“法西斯的法律体系”，并抗议规定的举证时间过短。拥有六十余万会员的产联电气工人工会的代表，亦在会上谴责该法案。保守的劳联代表反对宣布共产党非法，“因为此举不适合美国的最大利益。”保守的美国民主权利同盟代表，也抨击该法案不合宪法。
    全美进步团体已宣布，准备于六月二日进行全国性的向华盛顿进军，要求给予更多的时间举证，反对参院草草通过该案之阴谋。据民权保障大会宣布：黑人劳工、宗教及其他进步团体，均将参加二日的示威运动。同时，全国各地抗议该案之函电，有如雪片飞来。全国农民协会华盛顿分会在致司法委员会之电文中，斥责该案“不合宪法”，并将危害农民组织。全国律师公会纽约分会五百位律师所举行的大会，亦致电司法委员会，反对该法案。该委员会主席韦利在举证进程中，承认除以前收到反对该案的电报数千件外，该委员会最近又收到反对的电报五千件。据该委员会书记承认，反蒙特法各团体之代表，有四千人要求给以举证反对该案之时间，但该委员会只准备听取几个人的意见。
    按所谓“蒙特法”，原名“破坏行动控制法”，因该案系臭名昭彰的众院非美活动委员会委员蒙特所提出，故又称“蒙特法”。该案虽未明文规定使美共成为非法，但它一面扬言“美共受外国控制”，一面又扬言“凡以任何方式，图在美国建立外国控制的无产者专政的团体与个人，均属非法犯者，处以十年徒刑及万元罚金，并丧失美国公民权”，故“实际上将使美共成为非法”。（塔斯社）该案并无理地要求“美共及其外围团体每年向司法部提出党员及财政收支报告”，无理的“禁止共产党领取出国护照，及担任政府公职。”在美国反动派恣意摧残人民民主权利的今天，该法案所企图镇压者，绝不仅限于共产党；他们将根据此反动法案，随时以莫须有的罪名打击所有不满美国现行反动政策的人们，这正是此次反蒙特法运动之阵容所以如此广泛的原因。
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社报导：美国反动派继续疯狂的迫害进步团体。司法部长克拉克上月二十九日声称：所谓“联邦忠诚调查局”，只审定三十二个团体为“破坏团体”，其中有“美籍斯拉夫人大会”、“保卫美籍外国出生者委员会”、“美国援助民主希腊委员会”及其他进步团体等。参加此等团体的公务员，均将以“不忠”罪名被撤职。
