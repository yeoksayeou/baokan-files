　　Truly Implementing the Principle of Voluntariness and Equivalent Value
  　Reorganization of Mutual Aid in Houyiliying Village, Fan County
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] The masses in Houyiliying Village, Fifth District of Fan County, have reorganized their mutual aid groups according to the principles of equivalent value and voluntariness. The village has a total of 71 households, 37 of which rely on small businesses for a living. Last summer, mutual aid was forced upon them, and it collapsed in less than two months. This year, as wheat harvesting approached, the wheat of military families without labor was left unharvested. Coupled with wartime service and post-harvest dike repair tasks, the masses in the village felt that even one assignment would delay production. The work team stationed in the village convened a meeting of former mutual aid group leaders to discuss the reasons for the collapse of the mutual aid groups. They said: "Those with labor were working for those without labor for free. Originally, it was stipulated that those without labor would contribute two jin of grain per mu to those with labor, but this was not done, which made those with labor unhappy. Those with livestock plowed the wheat for those without livestock, and those without livestock didn't help with the weeding..." After the discussion, a village meeting was convened, and a review was conducted. It was decided that mutual aid groups should be formed voluntarily in the future, and they should develop their own methods. The next evening, group discussions were held again. Finally, the opinions of each group were summarized, and nine groups were formed in the village. Each group elected a leader, and Wang Yungong was elected as the captain to lead the village's production. Their stipulated mutual aid methods are: 1. Of the seven military families in the village, five have labor and do not need to be tilled in their place, nor do they till in place of others. The two military families without labor, with a total of eighteen mu of land, are assigned to various groups for tilling. 2. Those without labor or lacking labor are paid according to their work, or exchange labor for equivalent value. Those who go out to do business or plant gardens can also participate in the mutual aid group. When they go out, they hand over the work in the fields to the group leader, who finds work for them. It is tentatively set at five jin of wheat per day including meals. 3. Livestock bought jointly are fed in turn (Editor's note: The method of feeding in turn is not necessarily good and often ruins the livestock). If one family buys grass and fodder for others to use in the partnership, they can spread out the materials and costs to those families. If the livestock is bought jointly and fed by one family, the grass is shared by everyone. After this method was decided, the masses said, "This is more reasonable than before. Before, it was like working for nothing, but this way everyone is willing to work."

　　真正贯彻自愿等价原则
  　范县后一里营重新组织互助
    【冀鲁豫讯】范县五区后一里营村群众按照等价自愿原则，重新组织互助组。该村共七十一户，靠做小生意维持生活的有三十七家，去年夏天强迫互助，不到两个月便垮台了。今年快割麦子的时候，无劳力军属的麦子无人割，又加上战勤及麦后修堤等任务，全村群众都感到一声差便要耽误生产。驻该村的工作组召集过去互助组负责人座谈互助组垮台原因，他们说：有劳力的给无劳力的白干活，原先规定无劳力的每亩地抽二斤粮给有劳力的，结果没有抽，使有劳力的不高兴。有牲口的给没牲口的种上麦，没牲口的又不帮草……。座谈会后，召集村民大会，作了检讨，决定今后互助组自愿结合，自己酝酿办法。第二天晚上又分组讨论。最后归纳了各组意见，在全村组成九个组，每组选出组长，并推举王运功为队长，领导全村生产。他们规定的互助办法：一、全村七家军属，五家有劳动力的不用代耕，他们也不给别人代耕；无劳力的两家军属共十八亩地，分到各组代耕。二、无劳动力或缺劳动力者，按工给价，或等价换工。出外做买卖及种园地者也可参加互助组，出外时把地里活交给组长，组长给他找工，现暂定每个工管饭五斤麦子。三、牲口合伙买的轮流喂（编者按：轮流喂的方法不一定好，往往把牲口喂坏了）。一家买别人伙用的摊草料。合伙买由一家喂的，草由大家摊。此办法决定后，群众都说：“这比过去合理，从前干是白干，这样谁也愿意干了”。
