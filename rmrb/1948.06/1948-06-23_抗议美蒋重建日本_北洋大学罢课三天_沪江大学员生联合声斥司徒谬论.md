Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Tianjin Newspaper News: Teachers and students of Tianjin Beiyang University enthusiastically launched a patriotic movement in early June to oppose the United States' support of Japan, which threatens China. Students at the school held a protest strike for three days starting on June 4th. Various patriotic slogans and proclamations were posted all over the campus. The school's student union successively resolved on May 29th and June 5th: to respond to the Shanghai 100,000-person signature campaign against the United States' support of Japan, to establish the "Beiyang University United Association Against the United States' Support of Japan and to Rescue the National Crisis," to participate in the "North China Student United Association Against the United States' Support of Japan and to Rescue the National Crisis" (previously mistranslated by a foreign news agency's English manuscript as "Student Union Against US Aid to Japan"), to unite major and secondary students across the country to take consistent action, to resolutely oppose the reconstruction of Japanese imperialism, to oppose the Chiang government's continued export of raw materials to Japan, to demand that the Chiang government hand over its Japanese military advisor, Neiji Okamura, and send him to a war crimes tribunal, and to repatriate Song Ziwen's Japanese economic advisor, Kan'ichi Horiuchi, etc. According to a Tianjin public bulletin on the 8th of this month: when the school's faculty and staff distributed American so-called "relief" supplies on the 7th of this month, Professors Chen Jinmin and Zhang Guofan refused to draw lots in protest of the insulting remarks of Leighton Stuart and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot. Professor Chen said: "Stuart's statement is not only an intimidation of Chinese youth students and patriotic people, but also an insult to all Chinese people. We must protest with action and let the US government know that the Chinese people cannot be insulted and subdued." Professor Zhang said: "The US Consul General in Shanghai used the word 'maggot' to scold the Chinese people in his speech. We must express our protest against this great insult."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to Tianjin newspapers, when Shanghai students held a grand patriotic demonstration on June 5th, US Marines in Shanghai actually patrolled in a squadron of white jeeps with pistols on their waists, threatening patriotic students. The American running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's government, dispatched a large number of security police and so-called "Flying Fortresses" to strictly protect the US Naval Headquarters in China. However, the broad masses of students from fifteen major and secondary schools and specialized schools in Shanghai still despised the threats and persecutions of the US-Chiang regime, holding hands tightly to the left and right, forming a strong team, and marching towards the headquarters building, shouting slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialism's Support of Japan" and singing the majestic "March of the Volunteers" along the way. Note: The Flying Fortress is a vehicle formation used by the fascists in Shanghai to suppress the masses. It is led by an armored vehicle, followed by a truck in the middle, and a jeep at the back, used to disperse, arrest, and track all patriotic demonstrators.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Shanghai, 18th, Foreign News Agency: Two hundred and twenty-two faculty, staff, students, and workers of Hujiang University, sponsored by the American Church, recently jointly published an open letter to Leighton Stuart, protesting his absurd statement on June 4th. The open letter expressed indignation at the "threatening tone" of the statement. It solemnly stated: "It is our patriotism that prompts our actions against the US policy of supporting Japan." It pointed out that the patriotic actions of Chinese students "are not against the American people, but against the unreasonable and harmful policies of the American government." Note: Half a month has passed since Leighton Stuart issued his infamous statement, and it has been protested by teachers and students from more than fifteen universities in our country, and condemned by the broad cultural, educational, and public opinion circles across the country.

Another Dispatch: According to Tianjin Dagongbao News: The general strike launched by eleven universities in Beijing and Tianjin on the 10th and 11th of this month to protest Stuart's insulting statement to the Chinese people was initiated by the Student Congress of Yenching University, where Stuart served as president for many years, on the 7th. More than a dozen organizations at the school posted newspapers on the morning of the same day, protesting Stuart's statement, and they all emphasized that Stuart "adopted a threatening approach, which is close to interfering in China's internal affairs." Among them, the Morning Star Fellowship (a fellowship is an organization for extracurricular activities for students in church schools) wrote: "The motherland, which has been bullied for more than a hundred years, can no longer endure this act of not treating us with courtesy and equality!"

　　抗议美蒋重建日本
  　北洋大学罢课三天
    沪江大学员生联合声斥司徒谬论
    【新华社陕北二十日电】津报消息：天津北洋大学师生，六月初热烈展开反对美国扶日威胁中国的爱国运动。该校学生于六月四日起举行抗议罢课三天。校内遍贴各种爱国标语及文告。该校学生自治会先后于五月二十九日及六月五日议决：响应上海十万人反对美国扶日签名运动，成立“北洋大学反对美国扶植日本抢救民族危机联合会”，参加“华北学生反对美国扶植日本抢救民族危机联合会”（前据外国通讯社英文稿误译为“反对美国援日学生联合会”），联合全国各大中学生采取一致行动，坚决反对重建日本帝国主义，反对蒋政府继续以原料输日，要求蒋政府交出其日籍军事顾问冈村宁次，并将他送往战犯法庭，遣送宋子文的日籍经济顾问堀内干城回国等决议案。据天津某公报本月八日消息：该校教职员于本月七日分配美国所谓“救济”物资时，陈荩民及张国藩两教授为抗议司徒雷登及美驻沪总领事卡波特的侮辱言论而拒绝抽签。陈教授说：“司徒的声明，不仅是对中国青年学生和爱国民众的恫吓，也是对全中国人民的一种侮辱。我们不能不以行动抗议，要让美国政府知道中国人民是不能被人侮辱和屈服的。”张教授说：“美驻沪总领事的谈话中，用了‘蛆’字骂中国人。对于这种极大的侮辱，我们无论如何要表示抗议。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据天津报纸消息，六月五日上海学生举行盛大爱国示威时，美驻沪宪兵竟腰佩手枪驾驶白色小吉普车分队出巡，威胁爱国学生。而美国走狗蒋介石政府，则出动大批保安警察及所调“飞行堡垒”严密保护美国驻华海军总部。但沪市十五所大中学及专科学校广大学生仍蔑视美蒋威胁迫害，前后左右互相以手紧扣，排成坚强队伍，向该总部大厦进发，沿途高喊“反对美国帝国主义扶植日本”等口号，并高唱雄壮的“义勇军进行曲”。按：飞行堡垒系上海法西斯镇压群众的一种车队组织，前面由一辆装甲车带头，中间夹一辆卡车，后面则为一辆吉普车，用以冲散、逮捕、追踪一切爱国示威群众。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】外国通讯社十八日沪讯：美国教会主办的沪江大学教职员、学生及工友二百二十二人，顷联名发表致司徒雷登公开信，抗议其六月四日的荒谬声明。公开信对该声明的“威胁口吻”表示愤慨。并严正表示：“是我们的爱国心，促成我们反对美国扶日政策的行动。”并指出中国学生的爱国行动“不是反对美国人民，而是反对美国政府不合理的有害的政策。”按自司徒雷登发表其臭名昭著的声明历时半月以来，已遭受我国十五个以上大学的师生的抗议，及各地广大文化、教育和舆论界的斥责。
    又讯：据天津大公报消息：平津十一大学于本月十日、十一日举行的抗议司徒侮辱中国人民声明的总罢课，系由司徒曾任校长多年的燕大学生代表大会于七日决议发起。该校十余团体于同日晨纷纷贴出华报，抗议司徒声明，他们都强调指出司徒“采用威胁方式，迹近干涉中国内政”。其中晨星团契（团契系教会学校学生课外活动的组织）撰文说：“受了百多年气的祖国，到如今对于这不以礼貌及平等对待我们的举动，再忍耐不下去了！”
