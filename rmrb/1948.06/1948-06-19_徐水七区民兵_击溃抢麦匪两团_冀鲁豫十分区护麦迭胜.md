　　[Chahar News] The headquarters of the 33rd Provisional Division of the Chiang bandits in Baoding and its subordinate 1st and 2nd Regiments, on the 4th of this month, invaded our Xushui Seventh District to snatch wheat. Our local militia bravely resisted and, after an hour of battle, completely repelled the bandits, wounding more than 40 bandits, capturing one, seizing one rifle, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, three shells, and recovering 14 livestock.
　　[North Yue News] The Chiang bandits in Baoding plotted to snatch wheat, and our Fifth Prefectural Committee instructed us to strengthen the work of protecting wheat. Zeng, the puppet commissioner of Baoding under Chiang, convened a meeting of the puppet county chiefs of Xu, Man, and Qing counties and the ten chiefs of townships, towns, and villages on the 22nd of last month to discuss methods of snatching wheat. The puppet bandits planned to forcibly seize 15,000 kilograms of wheat per "bao". Caohe Township alone organized a "Wheat-Snatching Pioneer Team" of 1,000 people. The township has 40 villages, and the enemy planned to forcibly seize 30,000 jin of wheat. They also attempted to use threats to force farmers in villages near their strongholds to transport wheat to Baoding. They also arrested people in the villages on a large scale, demanding wheat for their release. In ×× Village, Xushui Fourth District, more than 20 women and nine young people were arrested, each young person requiring 500 jin of millet. In order to thwart the Chiang bandits' conspiracy to snatch wheat, the Jixi Prefectural Committee has sent strong cadres to the front to organize wheat protection work, and decided that all levels should establish wheat protection command posts to strengthen armed wheat protection. After receiving instructions from the Xushui and Mancheng County Committees, the prefectural committee is planning to launch a struggle to protect wheat. Wanxian and Yixian counties are making every effort to rush to harvest wheat. Wanxian Sixth District convened a meeting of all district cadres on the 9th to discuss the division of labor among villages to organize and lead the masses in wheat harvesting, with the Sixth District as the key area for wheat protection. Cadres from county-level departments in Yixian County have been mobilized to help military families who lack labor to harvest wheat, helping military families rush to harvest 28 mu of wheat.
　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 18th] In the Wenshang area, our local armed forces of the Seventh Military Subdistrict protect wheat, not allowing the enemy to move a step, and helping the masses to harvest wheat during the war. On May 24, two battalions and five companies, totaling more than 300 men, of the Wenshang enemy Security Regiment, led by the deputy regiment commander, went to Sucun and Suicun areas in our First District to seize grain. Our county and district armed forces, upon hearing the news, actively launched an attack, engaging the enemy in a fierce battle for more than ten minutes, killing one enemy company commander, wounding three, capturing nine enemy soldiers including a squad leader and deputy squad leader, and seizing eight rifles and more than 800 rounds of ammunition. When our troops launched the attack, the masses were in high spirits, some following behind the troops to participate in the battle, which ultimately led to the failure of the enemy's plan to seize grain. On the 27th, our Wenshang County Brigade also advanced to the junction of Wenshang and Ziyang, which had long been ruled by the enemy, to carry out activities and protect wheat harvesting, engaging in a battle with more than 60 people from the Ziyang puppet township government, repelling the enemy, and capturing one enemy squad leader and one soldier, seizing one Hanyang rifle and one Czech rifle, and more than 180 rounds of ammunition. At the same time, another unit carried out a mopping-up operation against local bandits, capturing Liang Yinghua, the deputy captain of the puppet township team, and six others. On the 28th, our local armed forces came into contact with more than 1,000 men from the enemy security brigade in Jiepai Village on the Wenshang-Ningyang highway, killing and wounding four enemies, and the enemy fled towards the city. On June 3, the Wenshang enemy went to the southwest of the city, three or four li away, and snatched all the "hutumian" and "窩窩頭" of the masses. Our local armed forces, upon discovering this, launched a fierce attack, and the enemy scurried back, closing the city gate tightly. In the two battles on the 3rd and 5th, more than ten enemies were killed, 22 enemies below the company commander were captured, and 19 rifles, one small cannon, and 845 rounds of ammunition were seized.
