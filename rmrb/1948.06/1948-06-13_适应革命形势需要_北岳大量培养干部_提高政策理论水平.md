To Adapt to the Needs of the Revolutionary Situation
　　North Yue Region Vigorously Cultivates Cadres
　　Improve Their Policy and Theoretical Level
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 9th dispatch] The CCP North Yue District Committee recently instructed its subordinates to improve the theoretical and policy level of cadres and to promote and cultivate cadres on a large scale to meet the needs of the revolutionary situation. The District Committee decided: First, strengthen the education of on-the-job cadres. In addition to general situation tasks and business learning, focus on studying Mao Zedong Thought. All party cadres, especially senior and middle-level cadres, must focus on studying theory, researching policies, and establishing a serious sense of principle; they must carry out ideological struggles within the party to overcome any non-proletarian thoughts and styles, correct "left" or right deviations, and eliminate the serious state of disorganization and indiscipline or anarchy that exists in the work. Second, vigorously promote and cultivate county and district-level cadres. In addition to adding deputy positions, establishing district committees that are not divorced from production, and fully utilizing people's representative conferences at all levels for promotion and cultivation, the district committee and prefectural committee will open party schools to train county and district-level cadres in rotation, transform their ideological style, and improve their theoretical and policy level in preparation for sending them to new areas at any time. The county will open short-term training courses to train newly promoted district cadres, especially cadres who have been newly promoted from the countryside and are preparing to leave production. In promotion and cultivation, implement the party rectification policy, that is, regardless of whether they are new or old cadres, all those who have a firm stand and a correct style will be cultivated and promoted; those with problems will be educated and reformed and used separately; those who persist in their mistakes and do not correct them will be cleansed; at the same time, in the cadre policy, we must strictly abide by one of the important characteristics of a proletarian party, that is, we must pay special attention to educating, cultivating and promoting those outstanding cadres who are from workers, farm laborers and poor peasants, so that they can obtain some necessary and appropriate priority in this regard, but it is not necessary to fall into a vulgar theory of only component. Third, vigorously cultivate village-level cadres, systematically connect with central work, use various meetings to educate them, and conduct short-term training during the agricultural slack season.

　　适应革命形势需要
  　北岳大量培养干部
  　提高政策理论水平
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】中共北岳区党委顷指示所属，提高干部的理论政策水平，大量提拔和培养干部，以适应革命形势的需要。区党委决定：第一、加强在职干部教育，除一般形势任务和业务学习外，着重学习毛主席思想，全党干部特别是高中级干部，必须着重学习理论，研究政策，树立严肃的原则性；必须开展党内思想斗争，以克服任何非无产阶级的思想和作风，纠正“左”或右的偏向和肃清在工作中严重存在的无组织无纪律的状态或无政府状态。第二、大量提拔与培养县区级干部，除增设副职，设立不脱离生产的区委及充分运用各级人民代表会议提拔培养外，由区党委地委开办党校，轮训县区级干部，改造其思想作风，提高其理论政策水平，以备随时向新区派送。县开办短期训练班，轮训新提拔的区干部，特别是从农村里新提拔起来，准备脱离生产的干部。在提拔培养中，贯彻整党方针，即无论新老干部，凡立场坚定，作风正派者，一律培养提拔，有毛病的予以教育改造，分别使用，坚持错误不改的，才加以清洗；同时在干部政策上，必须严格遵守作为无产阶级政党的重要特性之一，即必须特别注意教育培养与提拔那些由工人雇农和贫农出身的优秀的干部，使他们在这方面获得某些必要的和适当的优先权，但又不必要流于一种庸俗的唯成份论。第三、大力培养村级干部，有计划的联系中心工作，利用各种会议加以教育，并乘农隙进行短期训练。
