[JiluYu, 15th] Our JiluYu Military Region’s unit, in order to protect the masses’ wheat harvest, fought valiantly in the Junnan area on the 2nd and 3rd, removing strongholds at Renshawo, Tianzhuang, and Xi Niulou, and wiping out the entire transport battalion and the 86th regiment of Jiang bandit's 55th Division, as well as the Puyang County puppet grand brigade. The battle results are as follows: Captured over 1,400 enemy officers and soldiers, including enemy deputy regiment commander Wu, killed and wounded over 500 enemy soldiers, seized 3 mortars, 9 heavy machine guns, 41 light machine guns, 8 60mm mortars, over 400 rifles, 740,000 rounds of ammunition, over 30 mules and horses, one radio, and many other military supplies.

[JiluYu, 16th] Our Military Region’s unit fought heroically in the Junnan area, eliminating 2,000 enemy soldiers. The Military Region has issued a special commendation. The commendation stated: "This is a great victory for our Military Region's troops after party rectification and military consolidation, cooperating with Chen-Su's army to attack the enemy, protect the wheat harvest, and carry out the strategy of annihilating the enemy within the inner lines. It is hoped that the commanders and fighters of this unit will not be arrogant or impetuous, and will continue to strive for greater achievements. All sub-district troops must learn from this unit, be heroic, vigorous, and proactively attack, eliminate small groups of enemies, besiege and, when the opportunity arises, eliminate isolated enemy strongholds, block and eliminate enemy reinforcements, cooperate with the field armies in attacking, and strive for greater victories."

[JiluYu, 15th] In order to protect the border area masses' wheat harvest, our sub-district armed forces are actively launching attacks. At 4:00 AM on the 1st of this month, a certain regiment of the 1st sub-district's local armed forces captured the Luzhuang stronghold, killing and wounding 24 enemy soldiers, capturing 60 men and guns, and seizing 2 grenade launchers. On the 4th, our ×× regiment launched a surprise attack on the enemy at Wangyu, annihilating part of them, capturing 52 people, seizing 50 rifles, 1 light machine gun, and 1 grenade launcher. On the 2nd, 200 men of the × regiment of the Shandong Security 2nd Brigade attempted to loot grain from Wencheng to the southwest Mahe area, but were repelled. We captured 4 enemy soldiers, seized 1 rifle and some grain, and immediately returned the grain to the masses. On the 4th, the enemy from Wenshang again attempted to loot grain from the Mazhuang area, but were repelled by our special service company. When the enemy fled back to the city, they were intercepted by our certain regiment, which annihilated part of them, capturing a total of 20 enemy soldiers including company commander Niu Keqin.
