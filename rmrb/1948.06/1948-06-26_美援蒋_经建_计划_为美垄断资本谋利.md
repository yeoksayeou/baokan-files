　　US Aid to Chiang's "Economic Construction" Plan
  　Profits US Monopoly Capital
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd] Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the US aid to Chiang's "economic construction" plan on the 13th, pointing out that the economic construction plan in the Kuomintang areas formulated by the Kuomintang government according to the plan provided by American designers is not for the benefit of the Chinese people, but for the benefit of foreign monopoly capitalists. The US aims to keep China an economically backward agricultural country. Masinu said: The recent joint statement by Chinese industrial, commercial, and cultural circles published in Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao on the issue of US support for Japan, comparing the two economic five-year construction plans of Japan and the Kuomintang, is very meaningful. The five-year plan formulated by the US for Japan stipulates that Japan's steel production will be increased to 8.15 million tons, spindles will be restored to 10 million, and electricity will be increased to 8 million kilowatts. However, the five-year plan formulated by the US for the Kuomintang only stipulates an annual steel production of 200,000 tons, spindles of no more than 4 million, and hopes that electricity will only be increased to 900,000 kilowatts. From this, it can be clearly seen that the real purpose of the United States is to turn China into a raw material supply station for Japanese industry under the rule of American monopoly capital, and a sales market for Japanese industrial products.

### 美援蒋“经建”计划　为美垄断资本谋利

　　美援蒋“经建”计划
  　为美垄断资本谋利
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科电台十三日广播马西努关于美国援蒋“经济建设”计划的评论，指出：国民党政府按照美国设计家提供的方案制定的国民党区经济建设计划，不是为中国人谋利益的，而是为外国垄断资本家谋利益的。美国的目的是使中国仍旧是一个经济落后的农业国。马西努称：最近上海大公报公布的中国工商文化界对美国扶日问题的联合声明中，关于日本和国民党的两个经济五年建设计划的比较，是非常有意义的。美国为日本制定的五年计划，规定将日本的钢铁生产提高到八百一十五万吨，纺锭恢复到一千万枚，电力增加到八百万千瓦。而美国为国民党制定的五年计划则只规定每年钢铁生产廿万吨，纺锭不过四百万枚，电气亦仅希望增至九十万千瓦。由此更可以清楚看到美国的真正目的是使中国变成美国垄断资本统治下的日本工业的原料供应站，和日本工业品的销售市场。
