Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. A compilation of foreign news agency reports: Ten thousand students in Shanghai, breaking through the multiple blockades of the traitorous government, held a patriotic demonstration in front of the U.S. Naval Headquarters in China. On the morning of the 5th, the Chiang Kai-shek military and political authorities in Shanghai dispatched thousands of fully armed police, constabulary, infantry, and cavalry to set up blockades and sentry posts at various universities and at the entrances and exits of major streets and bridges to prevent students from going out and passing through. Armed police patrolled the streets in armored vehicles equipped with American machine guns. All parks were sealed off to prevent students from gathering. However, the students broke through multiple blockades in small groups. In the afternoon, ten thousand people gathered in front of the Glenn E. Morrow Building, the U.S. Naval Headquarters in China on the Bund (according to TASS), to hold a patriotic demonstration. The demonstrating students held flags, formed lines, sang heroic patriotic songs, and shouted slogans such as "Down with the American policy of reviving Japanese aggression," "Down with American imperialism," "Down with American aid" (note: this refers to American aid to Chiang Kai-shek; due to translation from foreign telegrams, there may be discrepancies from the original slogan), "American troops go back to America," and "Long live the independence of the Chinese nation," and distributed patriotic leaflets. At 5 p.m., Wu Guozhen and Xuan Tiewu, the lackeys of American imperialism and fascist heads, instigated 1,500 police officers lying in wait to drive away the students with bayonets and American automatic weapons, and barbarously beat and arrested them, capturing more than 50 students on the spot. The bandit Wu Guozhen ordered the Jiaotong University authorities to hand over the list of students leading the patriotic demonstration, and ordered his director of education to notify the principals of all schools by telephone to immediately expel all demonstrating students. Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education in Nanjing, also went to Shanghai to discuss ways to strengthen the suppression of students. At the same time, special agents planted in various schools carried out large-scale activities, beating patriotic students who were gathering and demonstrating on campus. According to the Chiang Kai-shek news newspaper on the 6th, in Shanghai Art College alone, 30 students were injured, three of whom died from their injuries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to a United Press report on the 7th: Student unions of ten universities in Peiping and Tientsin, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal College, and Nankai University, led by Yenching University, where Stuart Leighton was once the president, jointly issued a solemn statement on June 6, denouncing Stuart Leighton's statement on June 4, which extremely insulted the Chinese students' patriotic movement. It stated: "We express our serious protest against your statement issued on June 4 in your capacity as the U.S. Ambassador. We believe that this is an interference in China's internal affairs and a distortion of the Chinese students' patriotic movement against the American support of Japanese aggressive forces threatening China. Even if the 'unfortunate consequences' you mentioned in the statement occur, and Chinese students continue to be persecuted, this movement will never stop." This statement was sent by express mail to Stuart Leighton in Nanjing on June 6. At the same time, the North China Student Federation, which continues to exist in defiance of the Chiang Kai-shek government's dissolution order, also issued a statement, listing facts such as the United States establishing naval bases in Japan and training "kamikaze suicide squadrons," refuting Stuart Leighton's lies in his statement denying American support for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces.

In addition, Chinese overseas newspapers in Hong Kong criticized Stuart Leighton's statement. These newspapers pointed out that American policy is truly helping Japan to reorganize its army, and listed seven reactionary measures, such as the United States releasing war criminals in Japan, raising the level of Japanese industry, preserving the Zaibatsu, preserving heavy industry, reducing reparations, and rebuilding the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, as proof. It pointed out that all of the above measures were vigorously implemented by the United States, violating the interests of other allied countries.

　　冲破蒋党卖国政府封锁包围
  　上海学生反美爱国示威
    平津十大学痛斥司徒雷登侮辱学运
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合外国通讯社消息：上海学生万人冲破卖国政府的重重封锁包围，在美国驻华海军总部前举行爱国大示威。五日清晨，上海蒋匪军政当局即出动数千全副武装的警察宪兵及步骑兵，分别在各大学及大街桥梁进出口处布置封锁线及哨岗，阻止学生外出及通过，武装警察则驾驶装有美式机枪的装甲车在街道巡逻。一切公园均被封锁，阻止学生集合。但学生们分成小组，突破重重封锁阻扰。下午在外滩美国驻华海军总部格伦萌恩大厦前集合万人（据塔斯社），举行爱国示威。示威学生手持旗帜，排成队伍，歌唱雄壮的爱国歌曲，高呼“打倒美国复活日本侵犯的政策”，“打倒美国帝国主义”，“打倒美国的援助”（按：系指美帝援蒋，因据外国电讯转译，可能与原口号有出入），“美军回美国去”，“中华民族独立万岁”等口号，并散发爱国传单。下午五时，美帝走狗法西斯头子吴国桢、宣铁吾即唆使预伏的一千五百名警察，以刺刀及美式自动武器驱逐学生，并横蛮殴打逮捕，当场捕去学生五十余人。吴匪国桢勒令交通大学当局交出领导爱国示威的学生名单，并令其教育局长以电话通知各校校长，立即开除一切示威学生。南京的教育部长朱家骅亦到上海，商讨加强镇压学生办法。与此同时，特务机关布置在各校的特务“学生”，即大肆活动，殴打在校内集会示威的爱国学生。据六日蒋党新闻报供认：仅上海艺专一校，即有学生三十人被殴伤，其中三人伤重毙命。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据合众社七日电：平津北大、清华、师院、南开等十大学学生自治会，以司徒雷登曾任校长之燕大领衔，于六月六日联合发表严正声明，痛斥司徒雷登六月四日所发表的极端侮辱中国学生爱国运动的声明。内称：“对于你以美国大使资格在六月四日所发表的声明，我们表示严重抗议，我们认为这是对于中国内政的干涉，和对于中国学生反对美国扶日侵略势力威胁中国的爱国运动的歪曲。即令你在声明中所说的‘不幸结果’发生，中国学生继续遭受迫害，也决不能停止这一运动。”此一声明，已于六月六日快邮送交前在南京之司徒雷登。与此同时，蔑视蒋政府解散令而继续存在的华北学联，亦发表声明，列举美国在日建立海军基地，训练“神风自杀飞行队”等事实，驳斥司徒雷登声明中否认美国扶助日本侵略势力复活的谎话。
    此外，香港的中国华侨报纸，对司徒雷登声明加以抨击。这些报纸指出：美国政策真正在帮助日本重整军队，并列举美国在日本释放战犯，提高日工业水平，保存财阀，保存重工业，减少赔偿及重建日本海上防卫队等七项反动措施，作为论证。指出以上种种措施，都是美国强力执行，而违反其他盟国利益的。
