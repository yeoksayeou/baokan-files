　　On the evening of May 20th, the People's Liberation Army launched the second attack on Tumucheng in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway. The battle was smooth and swift. In less than half an hour, the People's Liberation Army had occupied half the city, and all the local reactionaries were driven into the fortresses. The whole city returned to calm, with not a sound on the streets, so much so that a platoon of the People's Liberation Army摸到 (touched, felt) the west gate cave, and the soldiers guarding the city were still dreaming of Zhou Gong!
　　Another friendly army outside the west gate had not yet climbed the city. Wouldn't it be great to open the city gate now and welcome them in to attack the enemy together? The city gate was hit with a loud noise, and the sound of "ding" and "dang" kept coming from the still night.
　　Suddenly, a voice from outside the door called out:
　　"Why can't you smash it open!"
　　The accent was southern, and so rough and unreasonable. It was obvious that it wasn't a friendly army, and it was most likely the enemy. From inside the gate, they asked a question, and it turned out to be the Second Company of the 363rd Regiment of the enemy's 94th Army. Our soldiers quickly announced that they were the "Tumucheng Self-Defense Force." The enemy was anxious to enter the city and kept cursing. We calmly told him, "The situation is too tight. We dare not open it without the officer's order. You wait a moment, I'll go ask."
　　This Tumubao used to be garrisoned by a regiment of the enemy during the day. Now this "American-equipped company" was sent here for guard duty. Hearing that the city was indeed guarded by the White Guards, they felt very relieved. Some lay down on the spot, comfortably sleeping, waiting to enter the city.
　　The People's Liberation Army patrolled slowly on the city wall with their chests puffed out. The Chiang bandit soldiers smoked and slept below the city. Sometimes, the People's Liberation Army soldiers jokingly made a joke: "Hey, are you really the 94th Army? Is it... um..." The enemy wanted to scare the "country bumpkins" and show off in front of the "Self-Defense Force", so he said: "Look, this is an American gun, an American cannon." The enemy was impatient and said some unpleasant words, and we advised: "Don't get angry, we are contacting the headquarters now, and the city will be opened soon."
　　Several tens of minutes later, the person making contact returned, and a certain officer also came. He ordered them to assemble and quickly enter the city. The iron locks on the city gate also rang "hūláng" "hūláng" non-stop. It was really opened. The Chiang bandits, with sleepy and happy moods, crowded in noisily. The gate cave was crammed full. At that moment, suddenly, hundreds of thunderbolts fell from the sky. Those who were lucky enough to run dozens of steps were intercepted by the People's Liberation Army outside. In just twenty minutes, the Second Company of the 363rd Regiment of the 94th Army was completely wiped out. All 107 people were annihilated. More than 70 of them didn't even understand what was happening before they became prisoners. Eighteen American-made automatic weapons, thirty-two American guns, and two American 60 cannons also changed hands.

    导正
    五月二十日晚间，解放军二打平绥路东段的土木城。仗打的顺当、短促，没有半点钟，解放军已占领半个城，土顽尽数被驱逐到堡垒里去。全城又复归平静，街上没有一点声音，以至解放军的一个排摸到西城门洞，守城的卒子还蹶着屁股梦周公呢！
    西门外的另一支友军还没登上城，现在顺手开开城门，迎接进来会攻敌人，不很好吗？城门碰的挺响，静夜里，不断传出“叮”“当”的声音。
    突然，门外开了腔：
    “为啥还砸不开！”
    话是南方口音，又这么粗哑无理，一听就显然不是友军，这多半是敌人。从门里问了一问果真是敌九十四军三六三团第二连，我们战士便赶忙通报自己是：“土木自卫队”。敌人急着要进城，还断不了咒骂。我们平心静气告诉他，“情况太紧，官长没命令，我们不敢开，你们等等，我给问问去”。
    这个土木堡，白天还住的敌人一个团，现在这个“美械连”被派来这里警戒，听说城里确实是白卫队把守，也就很放心，有的就地躺下舒舒坦坦的睡大觉，等着进城。
    城上的解放军挺着胸脯慢步巡逻，城下的蒋匪军抽烟、睡觉，有时，解放军战士懒洋洋的闹个玩笑：“喂，你们真是九十四军吗？是不是……嗯……”敌人要吓唬“土包子”，要在“自卫队”面前逞威风，就说：“你们看，这美国枪、美国炮”。敌人等的不耐烦了，说些难听话，我们就劝：“不要发脾气，现在正给队部联络，等等就开城了”。
    几十分钟后，联络的人回来了，还来了一位什么官长，他命令他们集合起来，快快进城，城门上的铁锁子也“忽郎”“忽郎”的响个不停，真是开了，蒋匪们带着睡意和快乐心情，吵吵嚷嚷挤进来，城门洞里蹩满了，就在这一刹那，忽然，几百个雷弹从天而降，侥幸跑出几十步的，又被外面解放军截住，仅仅二十分钟，九十四军三六三团等二连便全军覆没。一百零七个人全部被歼，共中七十多人还没弄个明白就做了俘虏，十八挺美制自动火器，三十二支美国枪，两门美国六○炮，也就变了主人。
