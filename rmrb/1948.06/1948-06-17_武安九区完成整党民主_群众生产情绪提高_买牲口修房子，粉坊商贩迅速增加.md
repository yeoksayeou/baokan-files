[Taixing News] After the completion of democratic replenishment and party rectification in Zhao Zhuang, Shili Dian and other villages in the ninth district of Wu'an in early April, the masses' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Farmers are also generally buying livestock and repairing houses, and flour mills and small vendors are also rapidly increasing. A new middle peasant said, "With the Land Law Outline, why not work hard?! To be frank, who doesn't want to get rich?! Production is different this year!" (1) In the two months after the replenishment, the middle and poor peasants of Zhao Zhuang Village purchased 26 donkeys and 1 mule. Shili Dian added 6 donkeys and 1 horse. Shi Dong newly added 7 donkeys. In addition, there were 10 households in Zhao Zhuang and 19 households in Shili Dian that exchanged bad for good, cows for donkeys, and donkeys for mules. Guo Suo, an old long-term worker who had been herding sheep all his life, sold his old donkey for 20,000 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency, same below) after the replenishment and added 140,000 yuan to buy a large donkey. Jin Xiang, an old middle peasant, used to farm 20 to 30 mu of land, but he was afraid of struggle and would rather carry manure than buy a donkey. This year, however, he bought a large donkey. He said, "I have to feed a donkey, and I won't suffer that crime again!" Zhang Qing, a donkey broker in Shili Dian, said, "Many people ask me to buy livestock, and the price of livestock has doubled from February to now." Party member Wang Kuiming returned the two mu of land he had occupied, and he was very satisfied with the party's policy, taking the lead in production. Not long ago, he spent 400,000 yuan to exchange a cow for a mule. He said, "I've only ever raised cattle before, and this time I'm raising a mule all of a sudden. I've never even raised a donkey before. This is a big step." Some middle peasants were still uneasy after the replenishment, saying that this was a replenishment, and there would be equal distribution later, and they didn't believe that it would not be touched again after the replenishment. Wang Kuiming explained to them, "This is the Land Law Outline, and everyone should work hard to get rich in the future." He also encouraged everyone with his own example of exchanging a cow for a mule. (2) A middle peasant said, "In the past few years, I didn't want to repair my broken house. What's the point of repairing it for my wife, nephews and nieces? I don't know whose house it is." But this year, everyone wants to patch it up. This year, on average, two out of ten families in Zhao Zhuang are repairing houses and roofs. In addition to repairing, there are also two new houses under construction during the summer harvest. Xue Shuangsuo, the director of the cooperative (former secretary of the CCP branch), has already made plans to expand the business in all aspects. (The cooperative is withdrawing 1 million yuan of capital to set up a carpentry shop to build houses and make furniture for everyone). Four or five families in Shili Dian are repairing houses, and eight or nine plasterers are often called to other villages, busy all day long. The wife of plasterer Hu Hushi said, "My husband used to have nothing to do, but after the Land Law Outline, he is very busy, and people are looking for him to repair houses everywhere." (3) The flour mill in Zhao Zhuang was originally a rural sideline industry. In the past few years, during the busy farming season, at most four or five flour mills could be opened. This year, even during the wheat harvest season, 14 flour mills are still operating very lively, which has never happened before. Because there are many flour mills open, many people have production opportunities. There are also more people selling cold bean jelly than in previous years. There are often more than 30 people driving pigs and sheep. There are often 20 to 30 people carrying poles and selling bean vermicelli. In the past, middle peasant Niu Weitian never raised pigs when he opened a flour mill, but this year he drove back 20 to 30 pigs at once. The production enthusiasm of the wrongly struggled middle peasants is even greater after compensation, and six or seven families often trade pigs. Regarding the seven flour mills that compensated them, they said that four or five of them would start operating in ten days. The new middle peasant Jin Juguan said enviously, "The children are all looking forward to it. They will all open before autumn!" In addition, several middle and poor peasants in Shili Dian jointly bought four large carts and engaged in transportation between Yangyi and Handan. They earned more than 200,000 yuan after running three trips. Wang Shucai opened a restaurant two or three years ago, but he stopped it long ago because he was afraid of struggle. He reopened it in March this year. He said, "If the Land Law Outline did not protect industry and commerce, I would not dare to open the door and would not dare to keep guests." Now his business is very good. Middle peasant Wang Zhonglu also stopped his restaurant last winter because he was afraid of struggle. After the replenishment this year, he quickly resumed it. His wife said happily, "This time we are not afraid."

　　武安九区完成整党民主
  　群众生产情绪提高
    买牲口修房子，粉坊商贩迅速增加
    【太行讯】武安九区赵庄十里店等村，四月初完成民主抽补整党后，群众生产情绪已经大大提高，农民并普遍添购牲口修盖房子，粉房、小商贩等亦迅速增加。一个新中农说：“土地法大纲了，还不好好干干啥！明说吧，谁还不想发财？！今年生产那方面也不一样了！”（一）抽补后两月，赵庄全村中贫农添购驴二十六头，骡子一头。十里店添驴六头，还有马一匹。石洞新添七头驴子。此外以坏换好以牛换驴以驴换骡的，赵庄有十户，十里店有十九户一辈子放羊老长工郭锁的，抽补后，两万元（冀钞，下同）卖了自己的老驴，又添十四万买了头大驴。老中农靳相的，过去种二、三十亩地，因害怕斗争，宁担着送粪也不买驴，今年却买了个大驴。他说：“可要喂个驴哩，不再受那份罪了！”十里店驴经纪张清说：“托我买牲口的很多，牲口价钱从二月到现在已涨一倍。”党员王魁明退了多占的二亩地，他对党的政策很满意，生产中起带头作用。不久以前，他化了四十万元拿牛换了个骡子。他说：“我以前只喂过牛，这次一下就喂上骡子，驴都没有喂过，跳这一步，可得大。”个别中农在抽补后，还不安心说，这次是抽补，以后还有平分，不相信抽补后就再不动。王魁明就对他们解释：“这就是土地法大纲了，今后大家要好好生产发财。”并用自己以牛换骡的例子鼓励大家。（二）一个中农说：“头几年我的房破了也不愿意修，修那子妻侄干啥，房子还不知道是谁的哩。”可是今年都就要糊补糊补了。赵庄今年平均十家就有两家是修房盖顶的，除了修补以外，就在夏收期间还有两座新房子不停的在修盖。合作社社长薛双锁（前中共支部书记）已经在各方面作出计划扩充业务。（合作社正抽出一百万资本开木匠铺，给大家盖房子制家具）。十里店有四、五家修盖房子的，八、九个泥水匠经常被别村叫去，整日忙碌，泥水匠胡虎时的老婆说：“以前俺汉没事做，土地法大纲后，他忙得很，到处找他修房子”。（三）赵庄粉房本是农村副业，前几年每到农忙时，粉房顶多能开四、五座，今年虽在麦收时期，十四家粉房仍然干的很哄火，这是从来没有的事。因为粉房开得多，很多人随着有了生产门路，就是卖凉粉的，也比往年多多了，赶猪赶羊的，经常有三十多个。经常担挑卖粉条的有二三十个。中农牛为天过去开粉房向来没有喂过猪，今年一下赶回二三十个猪来。错斗中农经过补偿后生产情绪更大，有六、七家经常贩猪卖猪。补偿他们的七座粉房，他们表示在十天以后就有四、五座要开工。新中农靳巨官羡慕的说：“伢都在展望着哩，不到秋天都要开了哩！”此外十里店几户中贫农，合伙买了四辆大车，在阳邑和邯郸之间搞运输，跑了三趟，就赚了二十多万。王树材在两三年以前开饭铺，因怕斗争，早就不开了，今年三月又开起来，他说：“要不是土地法大纲保护工商业，我还不敢开门，也不敢留客。”现在他的生意很好。中农王中禄，去年冬天怕斗争，把饭铺也停止了，今年抽补后，也迅速恢复起来。他老婆高兴的说：“这下可不怕了。”
