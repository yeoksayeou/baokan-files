　　Boziyu Corrects Deviations
　　Crops Planted Early and Well
[Shouyang News] Boziyu Village is a marginal village. The land reform was particularly chaotic, not only infringing upon the interests of the middle peasants but also struggling against the poor peasants. Out of the village's eighty households, twenty-four households were struggled against and liquidated, accounting for thirty percent of the total households in the village. Eighteen wrongly struggled households were poor peasants, seven middle peasant households were driven out of their homes, and one middle peasant household and five poor peasant households were forced to become "rolling teams." Since the beginning of spring, only the controls were lifted, and there was no good compensation or resettlement, so the enthusiasm for production was not high. After the correction of deviations was proposed, a meeting of village cadres and middle and poor peasants was first convened to clarify that the correction of deviations was to eliminate obstacles to production, so that everyone could unite and everyone could work. Everyone quarreled and made self-criticisms. The middle peasant Zhang Binggui said, "In the past, our village was never behind in farming or transportation. It's just that after some laborers were struggled against, their enthusiasm for production was reduced, and no one had any energy." Zhang Fugui said, "The middle and poor peasants are one family. If the wrongly struggled people are not corrected now, the amount of wasteland will increase." After reaching a consensus, the cadres went to the masses to listen to their opinions and conduct deliberations. Then, a mass meeting was held to mobilize production, and compensation and resettlement methods were discussed democratically. Everyone clarified the boundaries according to the central government's standards for classifying classes. Twelve middle peasant households and six poor peasant households were removed from the list of struggle targets; Zhang Qing and two others joined the peasants' association; Zhang Zhe and Zhang Dengqi joined the militia. Old man Zhang Weicheng said, "These people are like me, they have been poor since childhood and are willing to work. How could they have become landlords and rich peasants?" The forty-seven mu of land that had been divided and was uncultivated was lent to five middle peasant households and one poor peasant household who lacked land; two dou of black beans and one dou of millet were lent to two rich peasant households who lacked seeds; five middle peasant households received three dou of black beans and two dou of millet; and one poor peasant household received one dou of black beans and five sheng of millet. Zhang Yaozhou's oil mill was returned in full. Zhang Chengzhou had no courtyard to live in, so everyone discussed lending him one of the two empty courtyards in the village. With everyone respecting and yielding to each other, Zhang Fugui and three other households voluntarily gave up nine mu of wheat land that had been wrongly taken from four middle peasant households last autumn, and Zhang Dengyue gave up one mu of his most beloved pear orchard. Under the slogan of planting more early crops and taking advantage of idle time for production to overcome the famine, nine mutual aid groups were automatically formed, mainly using livestock, combined with male labor, and absorbing households without labor. Landlords, rich peasants, the lonely, and the lazy all participated in the mutual aid groups and automatically found livestock to cultivate the land. A well-known lazy person named Zhang Xincai also participated in the labor. Then, Zhang Dongliang and four others were democratically elected as production committee members. After seven days of intense effort, the planting of miscellaneous grains and millet in the whole village has been completed. Now the masses are repairing buckwheat land, weeding, and taking advantage of idle time to engage in transportation and other sideline occupations. Although the drought in the village this year is serious, after correcting deviations and providing loans, not only has no one starved, but the number of livestock has increased by three, and 130 mu of wasteland have been opened up, and the mutual aid groups are planting early and planting well.

　　柏子峪纠了偏
  　庄稼种的早又好
    【寿阳消息】柏子峪村是个边沿村庄。土改中斗的特别乱，不仅侵犯了中农，而且斗争了贫农。全村八十户，斗争清算了廿四户，占全村户数百分之三十。错斗中贫农十八户，有七户中农被扫地出门，有一户中农、五户贫农被迫当“滚滚队”。入春以来，只取消了管制，未有很好补偿安置，生产情绪不高。提出纠偏后，首先召开村干和中贫农会议，明确纠偏是为了扫除生产障碍，大家团结，人人劳动。大家圪吵检讨，中农张炳贵说：“过去咱村不论种地、运输，都不落后，就是把一些劳动人斗争后，降低了生产情绪，谁也没劲啦。”张富贵说：“中贫农是一家人，错斗了人家现在不纠正，荒地还得增加。”认识一致后，干部分头到群众中听取意见，进行酝酿。接着召开群众大会动员生产，民主讨论补偿和安置方法。大家根据中央划阶级标准，明确了界线，十二户中农、六户贫农摘掉了斗争对象帽子；张青等三人入了农会；张哲、张登岐参加了民兵。张维成老汉说：“人家这些人和我老汉一样，从小穷苦，肯劳动，哪能成了地主富农？”当将来分的和无人耕种的四七亩土地借给了缺地少地的错斗五户中农，一户贫农；借给了缺种籽的两户富农黑豆二斗，谷子一斗；中农五户黑豆三斗，谷二斗；贫农一户黑豆一斗，谷五升；补偿给错斗中贫农粮食一○八斤。张耀周的油坊全部退回。张成周无院住，大家讨论将村中两所空院借给了一所。在大家互敬互让下，张富贵等四户自动让出了去秋四户错斗中农麦地九亩，张登岳最心爱之梨园一亩。在多种早作物早接嘴、抽空生产渡荒口号下，自动结合了九个变工组，以牲口为主，结合男劳力，吸收没劳力户。不论地主富农孤独懒汉都参加了变工组，都自动找到了牲口耕种。有名懒汉张新才也参加了劳动。接着民主选出张栋良等五人为生产委员。经过七天突击，全村杂田谷子下种已经结束，现群众正在修垡荞麦地，拔草，抽空进行运输等副业。该村今年灾荒虽严重，但经过纠偏、贷款，不但没饿倒一个人，反增加了三头牲口，开了一三○亩荒地，互助种的早又种的好。
