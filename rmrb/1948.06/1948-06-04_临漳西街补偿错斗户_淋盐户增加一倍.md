　　Linzhang West Street Compensates Wrongly Struggled Households
  　Salt-Boiling Households Increase by 100%
    [Linzhang News] During the mass movement last spring, West Street seriously infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. In this village of 161 households, 28 households were struggled against. After reclassifying according to the new standards, there were 12 landlord-rich peasant households, 10 middle peasant households, 1 small vendor household, and 2 industrial and commercial households; the remaining three middle peasant households had their property confiscated and then returned. Because the middle peasants and industrial and commercial people were seriously harmed, the entire village's production declined. Most people changed their large businesses into small businesses, generally aiming to make a living and not seeking accumulation. For example, Sun Sigui only sells one pig a day, and no matter how much business there is, he dares not slaughter more (he dares not earn more money). This time, the masses of West Street acted according to the policy, recognizing that "middle and poor peasants are one family," and compensated 13 wrongly struggled households with 2,157,000 yuan. After the compensation, the masses' enthusiasm for production immediately increased. For example, middle peasant Lao Bu said, "Chairman Mao's policy is really good. From now on, no one is afraid of getting rich!" Li Zhangyuan is preparing to open an oil mill; 10,000 yuan bought him a millstone. Hu Jinshan said, "My cotton ginning machine has been installed, and I'll start working as soon as there is cotton. I'm not afraid anymore!" Last year, there were only 20-odd salt-boiling households in West Street; this year, the number has increased to 40-50 households. Even Shao Bo's grocery store is preparing a location and will open soon. (Li Jizeng, Fan Pingkang)

　　临漳西街补偿错斗户
  　淋盐户增加一倍
    【临漳消息】去年春天群运时，西街严重侵犯了中农的利益。这村共一百六十一户，斗争了廿八户，根据新标准划阶级后，有十二户地富，十户中农，一户小商贩，两户工商业；其余三户中农，没收后又归还了。因为严重损害了中农及工商业，全村生产消沉下来，大部把大买卖变为小买卖，一般都是以糊口为目的，不求积余。如孙司贵一天只卖一个猪、不管买卖多么多，也不敢多杀（不敢赚的钱多了）。这次西街群众按照政策办事，认清了“中贫农是一家”，补偿错斗户十三家二百一十五万七千元。补偿后，群众生产情绪顿时提高。如中农老布说：“毛主席政策真好，从今往后谁也不怕发财了。”李章元准备油坊开门，一万元够了个磨。胡金山说：“我的轧花车子已安起来啦，有了花就开始干，可不怕了！”去年西街淋盐的只二十余户，今年增至四五十户，连邵波的杂货铺正在筹备地方，很快就要开门。（李继曾、范平康）
