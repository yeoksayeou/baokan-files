　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] Since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline in the Fourth Sub-district, landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants who feared being struggled against and had fled to the south of the Yellow River and west of the Wei River have returned to their hometowns one after another. In early April, more than 30,000 people crossed the river at Liuyuankou to return, all of whom were refugee households from southern Zhili and northern Henan. In Gaopingji, the seventh district of Huaxian County, 30 families returned. Ten families returned to Zhang Village in the Chengguan District. Twenty-six people returned to Gao Village in the fifth district of Weinan. Most of the returnees have settled down to production. For example, a landlord who returned to Xie Village in the Chengguan District of Huaxian County weaves mats if he is a man and spins if she is a woman. Local Party committees and democratic governments are now properly arranging for their livelihood.
