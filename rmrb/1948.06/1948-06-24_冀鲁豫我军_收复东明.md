　　JiluYu Our Army
  　Recovers Dongming
    [JiluYu, 21st dispatch] On the 16th, our JiluYu local armed forces recovered Dongming County. The defending enemy, the artillery battalion of the 81st Brigade of the 68th Division of the Chiang bandits, and the puppet county government, etc., under the shock of our victories on all fronts, abandoned the city in separate groups and fled on the 16th. Our local armed forces ambushed the artillery battalion at Wangjiagang, east of the city, capturing two mortars, and seized the opportunity to recover Dongming County. On the same day, the enemy at Bizhai and Matou on the Heze-Kaocheng highway also fled in panic. Currently, there are no enemy traces in Dongyuan and Nanhua (new county, originally parts of Zehe and Dongming). Another dispatch: On the 15th, our JiluYu local armed forces ambushed the engineer battalion of the bandit Fifth Army and the special service team of the puppet Eleventh Administrative Office at Dahuangzhuang, Shan County, killing and wounding more than 20 enemies, capturing more than 100 enemies including a company commander, and seizing one small cannon, six light machine guns, and more than 120 long and short guns. On the 14th, another local armed force intercepted a part of the bandit 139th Brigade at Zhangzhuang, northwest of Yutai, killing and capturing more than 40 enemy soldiers including a company commander, and seizing one small cannon, three light and heavy machine guns, and two submachine guns.
