　　【Northern Yue News】Since the second production conference in the Northern Yue region, specialized counties have successively convened production meetings, and the focus of work has gradually shifted to production. In some places, after correct class designation during this period, the masses' enthusiasm for production has increased. In Lendian Village, Quyang, the class status of six hardworking middle-peasant households who had become prosperous was initially incorrectly designated, causing some middle peasants to feel uneasy and indulge in excessive eating and drinking. After the class status was corrected and items were returned, the middle peasants felt at ease. Zhao Yulong said, "I always thought the Communist Party's policy wouldn't be like this." On the basis of unity between middle and poor peasants, labor mutual aid societies were organized. This year, some places paid attention to voluntariness and equal value when organizing, such as Shangluoyu in Jingxing. When organizing initially, it was announced that those who were not happy with last year's old groups could leave. As a result, Zhang Tudo's wife, who had objections to Group One, jumped to Group Two, while the others were satisfied and stayed in their original groups. Zhang Erbao's handicraft group in Gounan Village, First District, Wutai, had six members who were wholeheartedly committed to each other. They cultivated 70 mu of land, saved 100 labor days, and insisted on recording work and equal work, which made everyone's enthusiasm grow. Recently, they have also increased the production of wheelbarrows, plows, and mills, preparing for long-term cooperation. However, some places have run into problems by not considering the actual situation. For example, Nanshi Village near Shimen has little land, and the masses mainly rely on engaging in industrial and sideline businesses and selling labor to maintain their livelihoods. The leadership did not understand this situation and subjectively organized agricultural production groups. In addition, the allocation of labor was not of equal value, which not only failed to solve the masses' difficulties but also restricted their production, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. In places where the masses have been organized, some have carried out the transformation of lazy people. For example, Li Lafa, a lazy person from Liangjia Village, Shou (Yang) Yu (Ci), has always been gluttonous and lazy. This year, the labor allocation group educated him and forcibly dragged him to work in the fields. After more than 20 days, he gradually developed a habit of labor. With the government's provision of grain and loans, Shacheng and 12 other villages in the Fifth District of Quyang used a loan of 13.5 million yuan to leverage 14.5 million yuan of private capital to buy 29 head of livestock. Nan Shui Lue and five other villages have repaired 2,315 mu of beach land, of which 473 mu can be cultivated this year. Meng Yao, Wutai, and Dingxiang have increased paddy fields by 2,436 mu this year. There are many varieties of sideline production. A coal station in southwest Pingding has solved the difficulties of more than 300 households. Jiangjia Village in Jingxing collects tea and digs herbs, and Guojia Village in the Sixth District of Shouyang makes handicrafts, spins, and makes shoes, all of which have earned a lot of money. In industrial production, after the Victory Coal Mine implemented piecework wages, the daily output has more than doubled, and workers' wages have also increased accordingly. The participation of women and children in production is very common. Women in Liuzhuang Village, Guangling, have organized eight agricultural groups, three manure-carrying groups, three shoe-making groups, and two thread-twisting groups (a total of 164 people) to engage in production, and have achieved great results. Women in Zhangzhuang Village, Hunyuan, rarely participated in agricultural production in the past, but this year 30 women participated in spring plowing and manure carrying. Women in Liuzhuang Village, Lingqiu, generally participate in production. Forty women have organized nine labor allocation groups and have motivated Liu Zengxi's wife, a rich peasant, to participate in manure carrying. Women in Xifu, Wutai, have earned 1.1 million yuan from spinning alone. More women from Lujiazhuang in Shouyang, Guocun in Meng County, Niuxingbao in Hunyuan, and Langhuping in Guangling have organized to participate in agricultural production than in any previous year. Children in Tingzi, Jingxing, organized 28 groups during the wheat harvest to harvest wheat and hoe the fields for military dependents. The children of Zhishakou produce well and do not have to spend their families' money to study. Children in Haizi and Shushugou villages in Guangling organized 25 people to dig 63,000 jin of grass, which solved the problem of livestock grazing.

　　改正错订成份后
  　北岳群众积极生产
    【北岳讯】北岳区自二次生产会议后，各专县相继召开了生产会议，工作重心逐步转向生产。有些地方在这一时期经过正确的划阶级后，群众生产情绪提高了。曲阳连巅村开始定错了六户勤劳起家中农的成份，致使有的中农不安心而大吃大喝。经改正成份退还东西后，中农们安心了，赵玉隆说：“我早想到共产党的政策决不是这样。”在中农贫农团结基础上，组织了劳动互助社。今年有些地方在组织起来时注意了自愿与等价，如井陉上罗峪开始组织时，宣布去年的旧组不碰心的可以跳组，结果张秃小的媳妇对一组有意见跳到了二组，其余的满意原组没动。五台一区沟南村张二保的制工组，全组六个人心投意合，种地七十亩，省工一百个，坚持了记工齐工，大家情绪越来越高。最近他们又增制手推车、犁、磨，准备长期合作。但也有些地方不根据实际情况碰了钉子。如石门附近南石家庄土地少，群众主要靠搞工商副业、卖劳力维持生活。领导上不了解这个情况，主观的组织农业生产组，加之拨工互助的不等价，不但没有解决了群众困难，相反的束缚了群众生产，引起群众的不满。在群众组织起来的地方，有的进行了改懒造汉。如寿（阳）榆（次）梁家庄懒汉李拉发，一贯好吃懒做，今年拨工组对他进行了教育，并硬拉着他到地里作活，经过了二十多天，他才逐渐养成劳动习惯了。在政府贷粮贷款扶植下，曲阳五区砂城等十三村，以贷款一千三百五十万元，带动了私资一千四百五十万元，合买牲口二十九头。南水略等六村修滩二千三百十五亩，今年能种四百七十三亩。盂瑶、五台、定襄今年增加水田两千四百三十六亩。在副业生产上花样很多，平定西南的一个炭站，解决三百多户的困难。井陉蒋家村采茶、刨药，寿阳六区郭家庄作工、纺织、做鞋，都赚了很多钱。在工业生产上，胜利煤矿实行了计件工资后，每日作量增加了一倍多，工人工资亦随之提高。妇女儿童参加生产很普遍。广灵刘庄全村妇女组织了八个农业组、三个背粪组、三个造鞋组、二个捻线组（共一百六十四人）进行生产，已获很大成绩。浑源张庄妇女过去很少参加农业生产，今年有三十个妇女参加了春耕、背粪。灵邱刘庄妇女普遍参加生产，四十个妇女组织了九个拨工组，并带动了富农刘增喜的女人参加背粪。五台西富妇女，仅纺线即获利一百一十万元。寿阳的路家庄、盂县的郭村、浑源的牛星堡、广灵的狼虎坪等村妇女组织起来参加农业生产的较以往任何一年都多。井陉亭子儿童在麦收时组织了二十八个小组，给军属收麦锄地。支沙口儿童生产的好，念书不用花家里的钱。广灵海子、神树沟两村儿童，组织起二十五人刨草六万三千斤，解决了牲口吃草的困难。
