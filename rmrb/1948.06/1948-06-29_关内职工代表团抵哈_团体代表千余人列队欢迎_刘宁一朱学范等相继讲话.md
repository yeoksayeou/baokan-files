Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th. The Inside the Customs delegation participating in the National Liberated Areas Workers' Representative Conference, consisting of over a hundred delegates, staff, and attendants, arrived safely in Harbin at 7:10 AM on the 16th. By 6:00 AM, the train station was already filled with welcoming lines – representatives from the Liberated Area Workers' Representative Conference Preparatory Committee, the Northeast Railway General Union, the Harbin General Union, the Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League Youth Workers' Department, and others, numbering over a thousand. Comrades Li Lisan, Liu Ningyi, Cai Chang, and Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the China Labor Association, were all present to welcome them. At 7:10 AM, amidst melodious music, the delegate train slowly pulled into the platform, cheers erupted on the platform, and countless arms reached out from the train windows, waving hats. The delegation disembarked amidst music and applause. The large banner "Inside the Customs Liberated Area Workers' Delegation" led the way, followed by the Northwest Workers' Delegation, the Jin-Cha-Ji Workers' Delegation, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Workers' Delegation, and the Liangguang Column Workers' Delegation. Nationally renowned labor heroes Zhao Zhankui, Zhang Qiufeng, and female worker hero Li Fenglian walked smiling in the delegation's ranks. Comrade Liu Ningyi, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee, delivered a welcoming speech to the delegation, saying, "Today we can meet in Harbin; this is the victory of the Chinese people's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. We must summarize the experience of the entire liberated area's workers' movement, persevere, and strive to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible." Mr. Zhu Xuefan was also invited to speak. He first paid tribute to Chairman Mao and the workers in the liberated areas on behalf of the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said, "I am willing to follow the comrade representatives and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, unite the workers of the whole country to win the final victory." Liu Yingyuan, a famous labor hero from Harbin, also paid tribute to the delegations on behalf of the workers of Harbin. Li Jiebo, the head of the Inside the Customs Liberated Area Workers' Delegation, immediately spoke to everyone, saying, "We have traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers, a journey of tens of thousands of miles, and everywhere we have passed is a liberated area; workers and farmers everywhere are engaged in intense production to support the front." He continued to say to everyone, "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are both very healthy, and they have entrusted the delegation to extend their regards to everyone. They are very concerned about industrial construction and the workers' movement." His words were drowned out by thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu," and "Long live the Chinese working class." After a while, the music resumed, and the delegations boarded vehicles amidst applause and cheers and drove to their dormitories to rest. It is reported that the Inside the Customs Liberated Area Workers' Delegation arriving in Harbin this time includes workers' representatives from the Northwest (Jin-Sui and Shan-Gan-Ning Liberated Areas), Jin-Cha-Ji, Pu-Ji-Lu-Yu and other liberated areas, as well as the Liangguang Column, totaling sixty-two official representatives. Together with the East China and Liaonan delegations that arrived in Harbin on the 14th, a total of one hundred and fifteen people have arrived successively.
