　　General Branch Correspondents' Comprehensive Report
　　The Situation of Wheat Protection Struggle in the Taihang Border Region
　　[Our Newspaper Message] General Branch correspondents summarized the situation of wheat protection struggle in the Taihang border region, stating: Taking it as seriously as saving lives, the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops, trapped in our internal isolated strongholds, had long made careful arrangements for seizing wheat. A month ago, the Chiang bandits in northern Henan held a special wheat-seizing meeting in Kaifeng. The Yan bandits established a long defense line on the western front of Taihang, attempting to encompass the wheat in the central Shanxi plains. To coordinate with the wheat seizing, the enemy prepared to conscript a large number of men. The bandits in Anyang forcibly assigned four soldiers and six laborers to each bao (group of households) last month, demanding twelve shi (unit of dry measure) of wheat for each missing person. Bandit supervisors planned to seize at least one battalion of laborers during the wheat grab. Due to the later season in central Shanxi, the tense wheat harvest struggle first unfolded in northern Henan. Since April, the Chiang bandits have been actively engaged in large-scale wheat seizing preparations, unseen in previous years. Militarily, deployments were made from the bandit 40th Division to the armed forces of various puppet village offices. Each bao in Anyang was assigned five additional men to form so-called "guerrilla groups" to assist in the looting. On May 4th, the 116th Regiment of the bandit 40th Division conducted a special night wheat-seizing exercise in Qiukou, Anyang. The puppet bandits Cheng Daosheng, Liu Lexian, and other units, as well as the puppet security regiments of various counties, also conducted wheat-seizing training. Li Zhenqing, the commander of the bandit 40th Division, personally made wheat-seizing arrangements in Xiuwu on May 25th. Puppet administrative personnel, from commissioners to baojia chiefs, held a series of wheat-seizing meetings and organized their so-called "underground workers" to actively cooperate in this large-scale robbery. As early as April 24th, Zhao Zhichen, the puppet third commissioner, convened a meeting of puppet baojia chiefs in Duanshao Village, Anyang, forcibly ordering the organization of secret societies and self-defense forces to seize wheat. From then on, they conducted large-scale activities to coerce the masses. From May 1st to 3rd, the puppet townships in Anyang registered livestock, carts, and male and female labor, stipulating that every man between the ages of fifteen and forty-five and every woman between the ages of eighteen and forty-five should prepare a sickle, a carrying pole, ropes, and other tools to loot grain with the bandits, with a penalty of one shi of wheat for those who violated the order. They also ordered each bao to organize a wheat-seizing brigade of over a hundred people to take turns setting out to loot. The Chiang bandits' looting plan was enormous. Anyang alone was required to seize ten million jin (unit of weight), while Jixian was set at ten thousand shi. Their looting methods mainly relied on bandit troops infiltrating our area, fighting and looting, establishing temporary strongholds to search and plunder, and supplementing this with kidnapping. The bandit troops stipulated that a kidnapped person could be redeemed with four to five shi of wheat, a captured animal could be redeemed with three to four shi of wheat, and a looted piece of clothing could be redeemed with five dou (unit of dry measure) of wheat. By late May, as wheat gradually ripened in northern Henan, large groups of bandit troops moved out en masse. On May 26th, two battalions of the bandit 40th Division in Jixian, the puppet Jixian "People's Corps," and puppet township armed forces invaded our Zuo Village and Taigongquan areas. Over a thousand enemies from Huixian invaded our Zhuoshui area on the 26th of last month. The bandit 40th Division's 318th Regiment in Jiaozuo and the puppet Wang Delin's troops invaded our Ningguo area on the 29th of last month. The 116th and 117th Regiments of the bandit 40th Division in Anyang, as well as Liu Lexian's bandits and the puppet security regiments of Cixian and Anyang, totaling two thousand people, invaded our Zhanghuding area on May 31st. In central Shanxi, the Yan bandit's 2nd Regiment of the 12th Column and the 213th Regiment of the 71st Division, totaling 1,700 people, also set out to seize grain on May 23rd. Small-scale harassment by bandit troops was even more frequent.

　　While the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandits were preparing to seize wheat, the CCP Taihang District Committee issued instructions on May 5th to protect the wheat. The militia and village cadres in each county of the Fifth Military Sub-district underwent short-term wheat protection training. Wuzhi Third District and other areas in the Fourth Military Sub-district launched the "Ten Thousand Thunder" movement. Joint defense among counties was generally strengthened, stone mines were manufactured rapidly, labor and military forces were combined, and wheat was harvested vigorously. Armed work teams and wheat protection teams were organized to go deep behind enemy lines and proactively attack. Our Taihang Military Group, led by XX and other units, launched a full-scale offensive towards the Daoqing Railway on the night of May 27th, capturing the Sulan stronghold on the periphery of Jiaozuo in one fell swoop, annihilating 150 enemies and greatly shocking the enemy. As the enemy looted everywhere, our local military groups, local armed forces, and militia met them head-on, preventing them from gaining a foothold and forcing them to flee back. Their dream of establishing temporary strongholds was also shattered. In the battles of resistance and attack, our militia achieved repeated victories. A certain detachment of the Bo'ai joint defense militia and rotational warfare team ambushed two hundred Chiang bandits who attacked from Jiaozuo, achieving a complete victory with zero casualties on our side compared to twenty enemy casualties. The county headquarters gave special commendation. In the battle to repel two thousand Chiang bandits who attacked from Anyang, the local military group annihilated over sixty enemies, forcing the enemy to retreat to their old nest. Due to the resolute attacks by our army, the bandits burned the wheat they could not loot. On the 26th of last month, when the enemy from Jixian attacked Zuo Village and other villages, they burned the wheat on the threshing ground. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandits' attempt to seize grain has been greatly frustrated, and our army and people are seizing the opportunity to harvest the wheat in a tense manner. The militia in the Second District of Xiuwu are watching the enemy with cold mines and landmines, and they have harvested six thousand mu (unit of area) in four days. The Jixian Brigade of the Fifth Military Sub-district assisted the people in harvesting two hundred mu in three days. Although our wheat harvest struggle has achieved initial victory, the wheat harvest struggle is a long-term one. From harvesting to transferring the harvested goods to the inland areas is a long process, and the enemy will not relax. The bandit troops that attacked from Huixian and were driven back to the city continue to forcibly conscript laborers, preparing to attack again. Our armed forces in various places are now actively seeking the enemy's weaknesses, severely damaging the bandits and puppets, and striving to overcome the previous shortcomings of being tight first and then loose in the wheat harvest struggle, and persevering in the struggle to protect the wheat harvest to the end, starving the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops to death.

  　太行边地护麦斗争形势
    【本报消息】总分社记者综述太行边地护麦斗争形势称：当作抢命看待，困守我内线孤立据点的蒋阎匪军，老早作了周密的抢麦布署。一个月前，豫北蒋匪即在开封举行了专门的抢麦会议，阎匪则在太行西线建立绵长的防线，企图囊括晋中平川小麦。配合抢麦，敌准备大批抓丁，安阳匪于上月即向每保强派四个兵、六个壮丁，少一名要交十二石麦子。匪督导区图在抢麦时，至少抓一个营的壮丁。由于晋中迟一个节令，紧张的麦收斗争首先在豫北展开。自四月份起，蒋匪即积极从事历年少见的大规模抢麦准备。军事方面，从匪四十师到各伪乡公所武装都作了部署，安阳每保又抽丁五名，组成所谓“游击小组”，以配合抢劫。五月四日，匪四十师一一六团在安阳秋口一带特别作了夜间抢麦演习。伪匪程道生、刘乐仙等部以及各县伪保安团也都进行了抢麦训练。匪四十师师长李振清则于五月二十五日亲至修武作了抢麦部署。伪行政人员，从专员到保甲长，开了一连串的抢麦会议，并组织其所谓“地下工作者”，积极配合这一场大抢劫。早在四月二十四日，伪第三专员赵质宸即在安阳段邵村召开了伪保甲长会议，强令组织会门、自卫队抢麦。从此以后，他们即进行大规模胁迫群众的活动。五月一日至三日，安阳各伪乡镇登记了牲口、大车及男女劳力，规定男子十五岁至四十五岁，女子十八岁至四十五岁每人自备镰刀一把及担子、绳子等工具，随匪抢粮，违者罚麦一石。并令每保组织一个百余人的抢粮大队，轮番出发抢劫。蒋匪的抢劫计划是庞大的，仅安阳一地即规定抢一千万斤，汲县则定为一万石。其抢劫方法，主要依靠匪军窜入我区，边打边抢，并按下临时据点，四出搜刮，另辅之以绑票等方法。匪军规定：绑一个票，须以四石至五石麦子回赎，拉一头牲口以三石至四石麦子回赎，抢一件被服，须以五斗麦子回赎。至五月下旬，豫北小麦陆续登场，各地大股匪军即纷纷倾巢出动。五月二十六日汲县匪四十师两个营及伪汲县“人民总队”、伪乡镇武装犯我左庄、太公泉等地；辉县敌千余人于上月二十六日犯我卓水；焦作匪四十师三一八团及伪王德林部于上月二十九日犯我宁郭等地；安阳匪四十师一一六团、一一七团各一部及刘匪乐仙、伪磁县、安阳保安团等二千人，于五月三十一日犯我张胡顶等地。晋中榆次阎匪十二总队二团及七十一师二一三团共一千七百余人，亦于五月二十三日出发抢粮。匪军之小股出扰则更为频繁。
    与蒋阎匪进行抢麦准备同时，中共太行区党委于五月五日发出保麦指示；五分区各县民兵、村干均进行了短期保麦训练；四分区武陟三区等地则开展了万雷运动；各县联防普遍加强，赶制石雷，劳武结合，大力抢收，并组织武工队、保麦队深入敌后，主动出击。我太行兵团某某等部则于五月廿七日夜突向道清线发动全面攻势，一举攻克焦作外围苏兰据点，歼敌一百五十人，予敌以极大震动。敌四出抢劫，我地方兵团、地方武装、民兵则迎头痛击，使敌无法立足，被迫回窜，其按临时据点迷梦亦遭粉碎。在阻击与出击战中，我民兵迭创战绩。博爱联防民兵及轮战队某支队伏击焦作出犯蒋匪二百余人，以零比二十之我敌伤亡获得全胜，县指挥部特予表扬。地方兵团则在击退安阳出犯蒋匪二千人战斗中，歼敌六十余名，逼敌退回老巢。由于我军的坚决打击，匪对抢不走的麦子即纵火烧掉。上月二十六日汲县敌出犯左庄等村时，即将场上麦子烧毁。目前蒋阎匪抢粮企图大遭挫折，我军民趁机紧张抢收。修武二区民兵以冷抢地雷看住敌人，四天抢收六千亩。五分区汲县大队三天助民抢收二百余亩。我麦收斗争虽已获初胜，但麦收斗争是长期的，从收割到将收获物转移到内地，是一个长的过程，敌人不会放松。辉县等地出犯匪军被击回窜城内，继续强拉民夫，准备再犯。我各地武装现正积极寻敌弱点，重创匪伪，并努力克服以往麦收斗争中是先紧后松的缺点，把保卫麦收的斗争坚持到底，困饿死蒋阎匪军。
