　　Production Dynamics
  　North Su Organizes Masses to Rush Plant Millet
    [Yuanshi News] Cadres at all levels in Beisu, the sixth district of Yuanshi, held a meeting and proposed to rush-plant millet. The whole village plants about 800 mu of millet, but 300 to 400 mu have been damaged by insects. Everyone is striving to complete the replanting of millet before the wheat harvest to avoid piling up farm work after the wheat harvest. It was decided that the Spring Ploughing Committee would be responsible for leadership and supervision, and the replanting would be carried out through mutual assistance and labor exchange on a voluntary basis, with streets as units to check the insect-bitten land. In order to prevent insect bites, everyone came up with another method: regardless of whether it rains or not, they help each other to push waterwheels to irrigate the valley land.

　　Zhangli Production Director Leads Agricultural and Sideline Production
    [Pingshun News] In Zhangli Village, the fifth district, production director Wang Fucang convened various mutual aid groups to discuss seizing the time to sow seeds and draw labor to engage in sideline occupations, so as to ensure that both agricultural and sideline occupations are not neglected. Within the mutual aid group, he mobilized collective shares to sell the rights, and earned a total of 100,000 yuan in foreign currency excluding expenses. He and the branch secretary and the chairman of the farmers' association personally collected ash from the nitrate house after lunch without resting, and the production director measured it斗by斗. Most of the ash was sold by elementary school students, which solved many difficulties in obtaining books. In these six or seven days, the village received 117,000 yuan. Everyone reflected, "The production director is really capable, seeking benefits for the masses. We must engage in sideline occupations after planting seeds, move one-third of the wealth, wealth will not come if it is not moved." Now most of the millet, corn, and cotton have been planted in the riverbed land, and the remaining gully land cannot be planted. Labor is now being drawn to plan to buy goods in Shuiye, Linxian.

　　North Mountain Village Head Leads in Organizing Cultivation and Transportation
    [Gaoping News] In Beishan Natural Village, Liujiamiao Administrative Village, the fifth district, there are two mutual aid groups, which, under the personal leadership of the village head, ensure that both spring cultivation and transportation are not neglected. Seeing that the spring famine this year was serious, he organized two mutual aid groups to carry out both spring cultivation and transportation. Wang Cunzhu led two people to carry eggs from Gaoping to Quwo to sell, and also brought some money when they left. They carried cotton back, earning a net profit of 160,000 yuan in foreign currency after deducting travel expenses. During the spring cultivation and planting, they also made sure to cultivate the land of outsiders first, so that they could concentrate on production. Under the leadership of village head Wang Cunzhu's active labor, it influenced the two mutual aid groups of Zhang Zhumei and Wang Songshan in Shengou Village and Tudi Village, who also ensured that both spring cultivation and transportation were not neglected. Zhang Zhumei and Wang Songshan's group in Tudi Village bought three cattle from Linxian and sold them in Gaoping, earning a net profit of 80,000 yuan in foreign currency after deducting expenses. Now the spring cultivation and planting work of the entire administrative village has been largely completed, and they are preparing to switch to sideline occupations to overcome the difficulties of the spring famine.
