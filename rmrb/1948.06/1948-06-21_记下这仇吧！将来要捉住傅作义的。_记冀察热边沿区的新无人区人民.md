　　"Remember this hatred! We will capture Fu Zuoyi in the future."
　　--Remembering the people of the new no-man's-land on the edge of the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol border region
　　Following the Japanese invaders, bandit Fu Zuoyi created many new "no-man's-lands" in the border region of Hebei, Chahar, and Jehol. Hundreds of houses in Sihai Town were reduced to ruins, none intact. The common people pointed to the broken walls and said, "The Japanese at least left a few tiles, but the Kuomintang came and left nothing but fire!" The mountainous area along the Pinggu-Miyun-Huairou road to the west, once a prosperous area, was also turned into a desolate "no-man's-land" by bandit Fu, stretching for eighty *li*, encompassing dozens of villages, a frightening desolation. In Ganggouyu, all eight *qing* of land were barren. In Beifeng, out of thirteen *qing* of land, only one *qing* of wheat was planted last winter. In Chutou Village, the corpses were left unburied. Meng Xianhui of Fentou Village was beaten to death by bandit Fu, and after the masses placed him in a coffin, bandit Fu burned him to ashes. From Gubeikou to Huairou, there was an epidemic. Among those "robbed" from the "no-man's-land" and those wandering outside, about half fell ill, and most of the land was barren, with weeds taller than crops.
　　We arrived at Fentou Village in Huairou County. The houses here were not burned but were "destroyed" by bandit Fu. The courtyards were full of weeds, doors and windows were smashed, and the rooms were filled with broken jars, rotten cabinets, and open boxes covered with dust. The floor was covered with chaff, rotten cotton, scraps of cloth, and broken glass. There were no mats on the *kang*, only some smashed holes. I went to Meng Tiantai's house, the room was in a mess, and the smell was terrible. His wife was sick on the *kang*. Meng himself died of starvation, unable to defecate after eating *ma shen*, and passed blood. He left behind two little girls and a little boy, all ten years old. "Everything was robbed clean, all five big and small pots were robbed, and twenty bags of grain were taken away, even my coffin boards are gone." This woman, who had suffered the disasters of bandit Fu, said laboriously in a drawn-out voice. Her voice gradually became low and hoarse, because she had not eaten for four days and was about to die. The troops' doctor patiently diagnosed her and gave her an injection. Now she was in slightly better spirits and could barely struggle to sit up. After the soldiers helped her take the antipyretic medicine given by the doctor, she stretched out her skinny arms and said excitedly: "I've been longing for you like I'm thirsty for water. This time, God has opened his eyes, you've finally come, avenge me!"
　　After everyone returned from the suffering visits, they began to argue about one thing. Some said: We should not eat wild vegetables, because this is the masses' life-saving food. Some argued: We can eat wild vegetables, but everyone should save an ounce of rice to help the suffering compatriots. The debate was reported to the political department, which called on the entire army to save an ounce of rice each and help the masses produce seedlings. The troops also cooperated with the Huairou local armed forces to attack the three worst strongholds, such as Fan Gezhuang. Bandit Fu fled in panic. Thousands of people who had been encircled by bandit Fu returned to their home villages, from which they had been separated for five months, supporting the old and carrying the young that night. Our landlord, Meng, returned home with his wife, carrying pots and broken clothes, at noon the next day. As soon as his wife entered the gate, she cried "Wah!" The comrades who were taking a nap were awakened by this sharp cry. Everyone got up to comfort her, gave her boiled water, and made room for her. "I really didn't expect to be able to come back! It's really not easy!" She wiped her tears and said apologetically to us, "The comrades have come, but there's no one to entertain you." She went to look at each room, which had not been inhabited for five months. Everything was disordered, desolate, and broken. If we hadn't come a day earlier to clean up, she wouldn't have recognized it as her home. Now she was crying sadly again. The neighbors came to see her, but couldn't say a word of comfort. They hugged each other and cried, each recounting the pain of being captured by bandit Fu. The last words of each person were always: "It's really not easy!" Meng controlled his emotions and said in a firm tone: "Haven't we come back? Remember this hatred! We will capture Fu Zuoyi in the future."

　　“记下这仇吧！将来要捉住傅作义的。”
    ——记冀察热边沿区的新无人区人民
    傅匪作义在冀察热边沿地区，继日寇之后，制造了许多新的“无人区”。四海镇几百间房屋，尽成废墟，无一完整，老百姓指着这残墙断壁说：“日本尚留几片瓦，国民党来了一火光！”平古路西侧密云怀柔沿山地区，本是富庶之地，亦被傅匪造成荒无人迹的“无人区”，长达八十里，包括数十村，荒凉的可怕。甘沟峪共八顷地，全部荒芜，北峰十三顷地，去年冬只种了一顷麦子。出头村的死尸没人收，坟头村孟先惠被傅匪打死后，群众把他装入棺材，又被傅匪烧成灰。从古北口到怀柔地区，流行着瘟疫，“无人区”被“抢走”的，与流浪在外的人，约有半数病倒，土地大部荒芜，野草比庄稼还高。
    我们到了怀柔县坟头村，这里没有被烧的房子被傅匪“捣毁”，院里都长满了荒草，门窗被砸毁，屋里破缸烂橱及揭盖的箱子上落满了尘土，地上是糠皮，烂棉花和破布片及碎玻璃，炕上都没有席，只有一些被砸了的窟窿。我走到孟天太家，屋内乱七八糟，气味难闻，其妻正病在炕上，孟本人因饥饿吃麻渗大便不下，拉血而死，留下两个小女孩一个小男孩，都是十岁。“什么都被抢得一干二净，大小五口锅全被抢走了，二十口袋粮食也被拉走，连我的棺材板也没剩。”这个饱尝傅匪灾祸的女人拉长着声调吃力的说，她说话逐渐低哑而无生气，因为她已四天不吃东西，眼看就要死了。部队的医生耐心的给她诊断，打了一针，现在她的精神稍好，能勉强挣扎坐起来，当战士们扶她吃下医生给的解热药后，她伸着瘦骨嶙峋的两臂激动的说：“象渴了盼水一样的盼你们，这回老天爷睁眼了，你们可来了，给我报仇吧！”
    大家访苦回来，为了一件事争吵起来。有人说：我们不该吃野菜，因为这是群众的救命粮。有人主张：我们可以吃野菜，但要每人节约一两米救济受难同胞。大家争论反映上去，政治部号召全军每人节约一两米，并帮助群众生产耨苗。部队并配合怀柔地方武装向最坏的范各庄等三据点出击，傅匪望风而逃，被傅匪圈走的成千群众，当夜扶老携幼返回离别五月的家乡。我们的房东孟某第二天中午带着老婆挑着锅和破衣服回到家里，他老婆一进大门，“哇”的一声哭了。我们睡午觉的同志被这尖厉的哭声惊醒，大家起来安慰她，给她开水，给她誊房。“我真没想到，还能回来呀！这可真不容易呀！”她擦着眼泪向我们抱歉似的说：“同志们来了，连个人招待也没有”。她到各屋去看，那里已五个月没住过人，一切是紊乱凄凉，和破残不堪，如果不是我们先来一天打扫一下，她会不认得这就是她的家。现在她又悲凄的哭起来，邻居来看她，但说不出一句安慰的话，她们共同抱头大哭，各自述说着被傅匪抓去的痛苦，而每人最后的话总是：“真不容易呀！”孟某控制着自己的感情，用肯定的口吻说：“这不是回来了吗？记下这仇吧！将来要捉住傅作义的。”
