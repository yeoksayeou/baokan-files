Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS reports that Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, and Gates, editor of the Workers Daily, attended the Senate Judiciary Committee last month on the 28th, which is currently reviewing the so-called "Mundt Bill," and denounced this notorious bill as unconstitutional, and demanded the cancellation of this fascist proposal. Foster reiterated that if the bill becomes law, the Communist Party will refuse to recognize and abide by the law, or any similar regulations. Foster warned: "American monopoly capital has fascist world ambitions, attempting to drag the United States into an imperialist war. They fear that this ambition will be hindered by the people's struggle for peace and democracy. The purpose of the Mundt Bill is to suppress the protests of millions of people, who place their hopes on every peace initiative of the Soviet Union." Foster continued: "The threat to the American people today comes from the Du Pont, Morgan, Harriman, and Forrestal groups, not from the Soviet Union or the new democratic countries of Europe, or the growing democratic movement of the American people. But there is no place in the world where people who have always cherished freedom and sought peace would hand over what they had seized from the Nazis to Wall Street." When answering the committee chairman Wiley's slander that the American Communist Party is a "tool of the Soviet Union," Foster said: "The American Communist Party is an American party, composed of American workers, farmers, clerks, blacks and whites, and its policies are made by Americans based on the interests of Americans. The American Communist Party is the blood and bone of the American working class and the American people."

　　福斯特出席参院司法委员会
    痛斥蒙特法违背宪法
  　剥夺了人民一切自由
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社报导：美共全国委员会主席福斯特与工人日报总编辑盖兹，于上月二十八日出席刻正审查所谓“蒙特法案”的参院司法委员会，痛斥这一臭名远扬的法案之违反宪法，并要求取消这一法西斯议案。福斯特重申：如果该案成为法律，共产党将拒绝承认与遵守该法，或者任何类似的法规。福斯特警告称：“美国独占资本具有法西斯的世界野心，企图将美国拖入帝国主义的战争中。他们害怕这种野心将为人民争取和平民主的斗争所阻挠。蒙特法的目的，就是想压迫千百万人民的抗议，而后者则把他们的希望寄托在苏联的每一个和平倡议上。”福斯特继称：“美国人民今天的威胁，是来自杜乃、摩根、哈里曼、福莱斯特尔集团，而不是来自苏联或欧洲新民主国家，或美国人民日益增长的民主运动。但是，世界上决没有一个地方一向崇尚自由及寻求和平的人们，会将他们从纳粹手中夺来的东西交给华尔街。”福斯特于回答该委会主席韦利的诬蔑说：什么美共是“苏联的工具”时称：“美国共产党是美国的政党，是由美国工人、农民、职员、黑人及白人组成的，它的政策是由美国人根据美国人的利益所制成。美国共产党是美国工人阶级的及美国人民的血液和骨干。”
