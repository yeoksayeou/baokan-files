　　Strengthening Mass Health Work
　　Zhentang Establishes Medical Research Association

　　[Jinan News] Zhentang (formerly Xinhe County), in order to improve medical skills and strengthen mass health work, convened a county-wide symposium of Chinese and Western medicine doctors on the 16th of this month. 127 people attended, including some elderly doctors in their sixties and seventies. At the meeting, many doctors conducted self-criticisms, exchanged experiences, compiled over 200 effective prescriptions, and formed a medical research association. The gains were significant. Doctors commented: "In a New Democratic society, it is wrong for us to put on airs and look down on poor people. As society progresses, we must also progress." Captain Zhang explained to everyone: "Doctors are mental laborers, not exploiting classes. In the future, you should serve the people well." The doctors were very happy to hear this. Wang Zheru said: "The higher-ups are so good to us, we should get rid of our old habits and become new doctors in the new society." He self-critically said: "In the past, in order to cater to the psychology of patients, I also used superstitious methods, telling patients to buy some paper to burn." Zhang Guojun said: "In the past, as a doctor, I always wanted to walk through the main entrance. In the future, I must serve the people well." Cao Shutian, a well-known Western doctor in the city, said: "When I was in a bad mood, if someone came to me for treatment, I would deliberately refuse or even feign illness. This was very wrong, and I must overcome it in the future." Wang Zhefu said: "After this meeting, everyone has made progress. The theory of 'Five Evolutions and Six Qi,' which is not in line with scientific principles, must be eliminated. Our traditional Chinese medicine must also be scientific." Li Binqing, manager of Guoxiang Pharmacy, said: "It is good that I do not sell fake medicine, but there is one area where I have let down the masses. I made the remaining medicinal residue into 'white grass' and sold it to wild medicine sellers. Although I did not directly deceive the masses, I am also responsible. From now on, I will never sell it to them again." After criticizing past shortcomings, they exchanged experiences and contributed effective prescriptions, with some even contributing previously undisclosed family secret formulas, compiling over 200 various effective prescriptions. These will soon be published in book form. Finally, in order to improve medical skills and exchange experiences regularly, the doctors initiated the formation of a Chinese and Western Medical Research Association. A county association was established in the county, and branches were established in the districts. Huang Qiyan and Li Binqing were elected as chairman and vice-chairman respectively, and Zhang Guojun, Cao Qingtian, and Yang Jinbao were elected as committee members. Responsible persons were also elected for each district branch.

　　加强群众卫生工作
  　振堂成立医药研究会
    【冀南讯】振堂（原新河县）县为改进医术，加强群众卫生工作，于本月十六日召开全县中西医座谈会，到会一百廿七人，有些六、七十岁的老先生也来参加。会上不少医生作了自我检讨，交流了经验，集成有实效的成方二百余个，并组成医药研究会，收获很大，医生纷纷议论：在新民主主义的社会里，我们再摆大架子看不起穷人就不对了，社会进步了，咱也得进步。张队长向大家说明：医生是脑力劳动者，不是剥削阶级，今后应好好为人民服务。医生们听了很高兴，王泽如说：“上级对咱这样好，咱们应把旧毛病洗掉，当时新社会的新医生。”他自我检讨说：“过去我为适应病人的心理，也利用过迷信办法，叫病人买些纸烧烧”。张国俊说：“我过去当医生总是愿走大门口，今后一定要为人民好好服务。”该城著名西医曹书田说：“在我遇事不高兴的时候，有人来找我看病，我故意推辞甚或装病，这是很不对的，今后一定要克服。”王哲甫说：“经过这次会议，大家都有了进步，那五运六气不合科学原理的说法要铲除，咱中医也要科学化。”国祥药庄经理李宾卿说：“我不卖假药，这是好的，可是有一个地方对不起群众，我把剩下的药料渣滓制成了白草，都卖给卖野药的，虽然不是我直接欺骗群众，我也有责任，从今以后，再也不卖给他们了。”大家检讨了过去的缺点，又互相交流了经验，纷纷贡献良方，有的把从未告人的祖传秘方也贡献出来，共集成各种成方二百余个。最近即将刊印成册。最后为改变医术，经常交流经验，医生们发起组成中西医药研究会，县设农会，区设分会，选出黄启炎、李宾卿，贻秋夺要正副会长，张国俊，曹青田、杨金报为委员，各区分会也都选出了负责人。
