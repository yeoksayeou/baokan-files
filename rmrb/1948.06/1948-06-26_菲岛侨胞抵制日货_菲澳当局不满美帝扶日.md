Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Reports from various sources: The American imperialist policy of condoning Japanese economic aggression has now aroused opposition from Chinese merchants in some Far Eastern countries. According to a Manila dispatch on the 18th: The Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with various Chinese business guilds and organizations, is about to form a Chinese Boycott Japanese Goods Committee to supervise all Chinese business firms in the Philippines, to ensure that all their original Japanese goods are disposed of within three months, and that Japanese goods will no longer be promoted thereafter. The committee has drafted the following specific measures for boycotting Japanese goods: (1) Chinese merchants who have Japanese goods in stock or Japanese goods en route awaiting delivery must submit a list of goods to the committee; (2) Chinese merchants who have ordered Japanese goods must find ways to cancel the contract. If the contract cannot be cancelled, 25% of the value of the goods will be used as a fund for building a Martyrs' Shrine; (3) Chinese merchants must dispose of all their Japanese goods within ninety-six days. Furthermore, Luo Fuxing (transliteration), a Chinese merchant in Singapore, stated on the 29th of last month: With the relaxation of restrictions by the Malayan authorities, the Singapore market will be "endangered" by the flood of Japanese goods. Chinese merchants in Singapore are currently planning to boycott Japanese goods to protect their own interests.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. American support for Japan has caused fear and dissatisfaction among the ruling classes of the Philippines and Australia. According to a TASS dispatch on the 10th, citing the New York Times: Philippine public opinion strongly criticized the so-called Draper Committee, which advocated aid to Japan. The Philippine government has been forced to ban the import of cheap Japanese textiles that compete with the Philippines' small-scale textile industry. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt declared in the House of Representatives on the 17th: "America's current policy toward Japan is quite similar to the Allies' policy toward Japan after the last war"; "America's policy of rebuilding Japan will create a potential threat to Pacific countries, including Australia."

  　菲澳当局不满美帝扶日
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：美帝国主义纵容日本经济侵略的政策，现已引起远东若干国家中中国侨商的反对。据马尼刺十八日讯：菲律宾华侨商会联合各华侨商帮及团体，即将组成一华侨抵制日货委员会，负责监督全菲华侨商行，以保证在三个月内处置其原有全部日货，以后不再推销日货。该委员会已拟订下列抵制日货的具体办法：（一）侨商之存有日货或运到日货尚待交货者，须向委员会开出货物清单；（二）侨商订有日货者，必须设法取消合同，如合同系属不能取消者，则以货价百分之二十五充作建筑烈士祠堂基金；（三）侨商须于九十六天内处置其全部日货。又新加坡侨商罗福兴（译音）上月二十九日时：随着马来亚当局的放松限制，星岛市场将因大批日货泛滥而“蒙受危害”。星岛侨商目前正拟抵制日货，以保障自身的利益。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】美国扶日政策，已使菲律宾与澳洲的统治阶级感到恐惧，并表示不满。据塔斯社十日引纽约时报消息称：菲律宾舆论强烈抨击力主援日之所谓德莱柏委员会。菲政府已被迫禁止那些与菲律宾小规模纺织业相竟争的日本廉价纺织品进口。另据中央社电讯称：澳洲外长伊瓦特十七日在众院宣称：“美国今日的对日政策，颇似上次大战后协约国的对日政策”；“美国重建日本的政策，将促成对澳洲在内的太平洋诸国之潜在威胁”。
