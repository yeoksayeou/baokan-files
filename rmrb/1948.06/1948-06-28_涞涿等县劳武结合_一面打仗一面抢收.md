　　【Chahar News】 Laishui, Zhuozhou, Xushui, Fangshan and other counties’ local armed forces and militia are actively combating Chiang Kai-shek bandits who are trying to loot wheat, and are defending the wheat harvest of the masses in the marginal areas. On June 6th, more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Laishui harassed the Weicun area of the third district of Laishui. Our district militia met them head-on and fought for more than an hour, wounding four enemies. The enemy could not withstand and retreated back to the city. Since then, the enemy dared not easily harass, and the masses in the Weicun area seized the gap to step up production, intensively hoeing more than 10,000 mu of land, planting 5,000 mu of land, and starting to pull wheat in advance from June 11th. After the wheat harvest, labor and military affairs were combined, with a small number of militia acting as guards, and the rest bringing weapons to participate in wheat pulling. If gunfire was heard, they would rush to fight, and joint village operations were implemented. According to statistics from 24 villages north of Xiadongting and Weicun, the masses pulled a total of more than 15,000 mu of wheat on the 11th and 12th. The Xushui local armed forces and militia fought against Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops who were looting grain. In the past half month, they killed and wounded more than 20 bandits and captured 9 people below the rank of company commander, seizing 1 machine gun, 11 rifles, and some war horses, bullets, vehicles, and livestock. Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops in Xushui ordered a large-scale looting of wheat, and began to harass constantly in mid-June. According to statistics from more than 20 villages in the sixth and seventh districts, more than 320 houses were burned down, and the fourth, fifth, and ninth districts were also constantly raided by the enemy, which the masses hated deeply. Our labor and military militia were urgently mobilized at this time, and put forward slogans such as "district cadres lead the militia to hold the position" and "develop village, mine, and tunnel warfare", repeatedly repelling the wheat-looting Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Now many villages are implementing the combination of labor and military affairs, and are rushing to pull wheat. For example, five work groups in Fucun in the fifth district rushed to harvest 209 mu of wheat in three days, and large carts from various villages in the front of the fourth district continuously transported wheat to the rear for storage every day. The enemy in Fangshan City also moved frequently during the wheat harvest period, and went in and out of the fifth district four times in a row from June 7th to 10th alone. The party, government, army, and people of the county actively carried out the wheat protection struggle, and set off a surge of rush harvesting. Shiwocun in the sixth district put forward the slogan "harvest as soon as it ripens, and the whole village starts together when most of it is ripe", and has completely completed the wheat harvest. Jiaofang and other villages have generally completed half of the harvest, and at least one-third has been harvested; a lot of dry land wheat in the fifth and sixth districts has also been harvested; at present, in addition to leaving the grain to be handed over to the public and the wheat currently eaten, all villages have properly protected their harvests, so that the enemy cannot rob a single grain.

　　涞涿等县劳武结合
  　一面打仗一面抢收
    【察哈尔讯】涞涿、徐水、房山等县地武、民兵积极打击抢麦蒋匪，保卫边缘区群众麦收。六月六日，涞水蒋匪二百余人，至涞涿三区魏村一带骚扰，我该区民兵迎头痛击，战一时余，伤敌四名，敌不支退回城内。自此，敌不敢轻易出扰，魏村一带群众即抓紧空隙突击生产，紧张的锄地达万多亩，耩地五千余亩，并于六月十一日起开始提前拔麦。麦收后实行劳武结合，由少数民兵担任警戒，其余带上武器参加拔麦，发现枪声即赶往打仗，并实行了联村作战。据下东亭、魏村以北廿四村统计，十一、二两日群众共拔麦一万五千余亩。徐水地武民兵打击抢粮蒋傅匪军，半月来共毙伤匪伪廿余名，生俘连长以下九名，缴机枪一，步枪十一，战马、子弹、车辆、牲畜等一部。徐水蒋傅匪军令大肆抢麦，于本月中旬即开始不断出扰，据六、七区廿余村统计，共被烧毁民房三百廿余间，四、五、九区亦不断遭敌突袭，群众恨之入骨。我劳武民兵在此时紧急动员起来，提出“区干部带领民兵坚持阵地”，“开展村落、地雷、地道战”等口号，屡次击退抢麦蒋匪。现不少村庄实行劳武结合，突击拔麦。如五区富村五个拨工组三天突击收麦二百零九亩，四区前方各村每日大车不断将麦运往后方储藏。房山城敌人于麦收期间亦出动频繁，仅六月七日至十日，连续向五区出入四次。该县党政军民积极开展护麦斗争，掀起突击麦收热潮。六区石窝村提出“熟一块收一块，大部熟了全村齐下手”的口号，已全部完成麦收。椒房等村庄一般已完成一半，顶少也收了三分之一；五、六区旱地麦子也收了不少；目前各村除留下交公粮和当前吃的麦子外，均已妥善护壁，不让敌人抢走一粒麦。
