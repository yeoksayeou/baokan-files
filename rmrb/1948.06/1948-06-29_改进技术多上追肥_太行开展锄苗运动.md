　　Improve Technology and Increase Topdressing
  　Taihang Launches Weeding Campaign
    [Taihang News] Farmers in various parts of Taihang are launching a weeding campaign to ensure this year's yield by improving technology and increasing topdressing. Lincheng, Neiqiu, and other counties have completed the first weeding and are now carrying out the second. Statistics from seventy-seven villages in twelve counties, including Pingshun, Licheng, Changzhi, and Zuoquan, show that approximately 70% of the autumn fields have undergone one weeding. At the beginning of production this spring, many village cadres and farmers in some villages had some misunderstandings about party rectification and filling gaps, and their emotions were not stable enough. Most of the work in the fields was done relatively roughly, and not much fertilizer was applied. In order to make up for this defect, various places are responding to the call of the Administrative Office and are paying attention to improving weeding techniques and increasing topdressing. Li Fuhei, a military dependent in Xichuan Village, Third District of Huguan, applied 350 loads of topdressing to his four mu of corn. Ma Jinwang applied manure to his one mu of "Golden Queen" corn three times, with 50 loads of topdressing alone. Under their influence, a total of 2,729 loads of topdressing were applied to the village's 41 mu of "Golden Queen" corn. Pingshun convened a meeting of labor heroes and technical experts to summarize past experiences, review the formalism and coercive command style in promoting scientific and technological, and clarified that scientific and technological must be combined with the experience and requirements of the masses, and promoted with the consent of the masses, providing important experience for future technical leadership. When the technical committee of Jiepan Village, Sixth District, studied weeding, they used the clear contrast between Sang Qingxin's more than five mu of land yielding ten stones of grain last year and Wang Chengsuo's six mu of land (with the same soil quality) yielding only six stones to illustrate the importance of requesting technology and applying more topdressing. This educated everyone and resulted in a research on improved millet and corn weeding techniques. The whole village is now actively weeding and has sent more than 1,200 loads of topdressing to the fields. Li Shunda, a Taihang labor hero, put forward the slogan "The hoe determines life and death, carrying seedlings is like carrying dung" during weeding, which promoted 46 laborers in his village to weed 220 mu in seven days, and achieved careful and meticulous work. Under the leadership and promotion of party members in Nanweiquan Village, Licheng, more than 500 mu of autumn seedlings have been weeded for the first time, and more than 700 mu have been topdressed. In order to overcome the labor shortage that has been aggravated this year due to simultaneous weeding and wheat harvesting, various places have paid special attention to absorbing women and other half-laborers to participate in weeding. In Wenyan Village, Heshun County, 327 people weeded, of which women and children accounted for more than 36.4%. Twenty-six women in Sancha Village, Shouyang, weeded 84 mu in four days. Guo Latao and other military family women in Nanku Han Village voluntarily formed a group to reduce the village's burden of farming on their behalf, weeding 12 mu in one and a half days.
    [Taihang News] In order to make up for the loss of rough farming and insufficient fertilization this spring, the cadres of Nansong Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, specially convened meetings of cadres and masses on the 7th and 8th of this month to discuss ways to apply topdressing during weeding. Everyone carefully calculated that there are seven kinds of fertilizers that can be accumulated: (1) More than 200 sheep in the village accumulate 60 loads of fertilizer every night, which can accumulate 5,400 loads from the third month of the lunar calendar to the end of May, which can be applied to 362 mu of land. (2) There are 72 large pigs and more than 40 small pigs, which can accumulate 1,500 loads of fertilizer from mid-March to mid-May, which can be applied to 150 mu of land. (3) 56 head of livestock can accumulate 1,680 loads of fertilizer in two months, which can be applied to 120 mu of land. (4) More than 370 households in the village have more than 400 toilets, which can accumulate more than 8,000 loads of night soil, which can be applied to more than 800 mu of land. (5) More than 6,000 loads of burned wasteland fertilizer can be applied to more than 300 mu. (6) Purchase a batch of sesame cakes, which can be applied to more than 100 mu. The whole village can strive to apply all the topdressing to the land by the end of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. In order to ensure that the land of military dependents can also be fertilized, the soil fertilizer from the demolished temple is allowed to be used by the military dependents free of charge. Production experts also studied fertilization technology to maximize the effect. It was determined that sesame cakes, soil fertilizer, and pen manure can be used on river land to prevent crops from being harmed by early frost in autumn; night soil and pig and sheep manure can be used on mountain slopes so that crops can withstand drought. At the meeting, it was found that 26 households had no food to eat at the moment. Everyone discussed and decided: (1) The credit union will lend 300,000 yuan of Ji banknotes to 12 households with labor to earn money by carrying loads. (2) Everyone can borrow from each other. (3) Blacksmiths can draw wages and rice in advance. (Zhen Hua, Zhi An)

　　改进技术多上追肥
  　太行开展锄苗运动
    【太行讯】太行各地农民展开锄苗运动，以改进技术、增上追肥等方法保证今年的产量。临城、内邱等县已普锄一遍，现正进行二锄。平顺、黎城、长治、左权等十二个县七十七个村统计，约百分之七十的秋田已过一锄。今春开始生产时，不少村庄的村干、农民因对整党、填补有若干误解，情绪不够安定，地里活多半做得比较粗糙，施肥也不多。各地为弥补这一缺陷，响应行署号召，都在注意改进锄苗技术，并多上追肥。壶关三区西川村抗属李富黑四亩土玉茭上追肥三百五十担。马金旺一亩金皇后连上三次粪，光追肥就上了五十担。在他们影响下，全村四十一亩金皇后共上追肥二千七百二十九担。平顺曾召开劳动英雄技术能手会议，总结过去经验，检讨了推广科学技术上的形式主义与强迫命令作风，明确了科学技术必须与群众经验和要求结合，在群众同意下推广，给今后技术领导提供了重要经验。六区界畔＠村技术委员会研究锄苗时，用去年桑清新五亩多地收粮十石与王成锁六亩地（地质相同）只收六石的显明对比，说明请求技术与多上追肥的重要。教育了大家，研究出改进锄谷、锄玉茭的技术。全村现正积极锄苗，并已把一千二百多担追肥送到地里。太行劳动英雄李顺达在锄苗中提出“锄头定生死，挑苗顶上粪”的口号，推动他村四十六个劳力七天锄苗二百二十亩，并且做到了加工细作。黎城南委泉村在党员带头与推动下，已有五百多亩秋苗锄过头遍，七百多亩上了追肥。为克服今年因为同时锄苗、收麦而加重了的劳力缺乏，各地特别注意了吸收妇女及其他半个劳力参加锄苗。和顺县温源村有三百二十七个人锄苗，其中妇女儿童占百分之三十六点四强。寿阳三岔村二十六个妇女上地，四天锄苗八十四亩。南库韩村军属妇女郭拉桃等五人为减少村上代耕负担，自动结组，一天半锄苗十二亩。
    【太行讯】长治五区南宋村干部为了弥补今春做地粗糙、上肥不足的损失，特于本月七、八两日先后召集干部与群众会议，讨论锄苗中上追肥的办法。大家详细计算了一下，可积的肥料共有七种：（一）全村二百多只羊，每夜积肥六十担，从阴历三月初算到五月底可积五千四百担，能上三六二亩地。（二）有大猪七十二只，小猪四十多只，从三月中旬到五月中旬可积肥一千五百担，能上一百五十亩地。（三）牲口五十六头，二个月可积肥一千六百八十担，能上一百二十亩地。（四）全村三百七十多户，厕所四百多个，可积八千多担圊肥，能上八百多亩地。（五）熏荒肥六千多担，能上三百多亩。（六）购买一部麻饼，上一百多亩。全村土地阴历五月底可争取全部上好追肥。为保证抗属的地也能上粪，将拆破庙的土肥让抗属不花钱使用。生产能手们同时研究了上肥技术，以便发挥最大的作用。确定河地上麻饼与土肥、圈肥，可使庄稼避免秋季早霜时受害；山坡地上圊肥、猪羊肥，庄稼可以耐旱。会上发现锄苗积肥中有二十六户当下没吃的，大家讨论决定：（一）信用部贷给十二户有劳力的三十万元冀钞，让他们担挑赚钱。（二）大家可以互借。（三）打铁工人，可预支工资米。（振华、治安）
