  　Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee Criticizes the Wrongful Beatings in Xiangling and Yicheng
    [Taiyue News] The Taiyue Second Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a circular criticizing Yingdi Village in Yicheng County and Shangxiliang Village in Xiangling County for persisting in left-leaning, reckless errors, continuing to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants, and continuing the phenomenon of hanging and beating middle peasants. The committee demanded that the county committee conduct a strict investigation and thoroughly rectify these issues. Yang Haoren, a member of the Standing Committee of the Second District Farmers' Association in Yicheng, arrived in Yingdi on April 23rd. On April 24th, together with village cadres Hao Chunkuai, Gao Jingwen, and others, they first upgraded middle peasant Gao Jingli to the status of a rich peasant and led the masses in a struggle session, dragging him out and beating him. Middle peasant Hao Lifeng requested that Yang Haoren correct this, but Yang refused, saying, "Prohibiting the use of corporal punishment is a way to support landlords." They continued to drag him out and beat him the next day. This went on for five days, and finally, Gao Jingli was driven out of his house, and all his property was confiscated. Gao Jingyou was also implicated in the struggle, and Gao Jingyou's sick wife was frightened to death. More than a dozen county and district cadres were stationed at Shangxiliang base point in the Fifth District of Xiangling, where beating incidents also occurred. Three people were beaten. One was Liang Daoqing, a rich peasant. The masses wanted to borrow 20 *shi* of grain from him, but he said he could only give 5 *shi*, so they said he was not surrendering and beat him. Even his hired worker, Fulong, was also beaten. Another person who was beaten was Deng Qijin. While beating him, the masses said that current laws do not allow beating people; however, the work team comrades said: "Aren't laws made by people?" (Details of the third person beaten are unknown.) After these two incidents occurred, nearby villages heard about them and developed and increased their suspicion of the Party's policies. Some villages also wanted to follow suit and beat people, adding many difficulties to future work. In Yingdi and Shangxiliang villages, it further isolated the poor and hired peasants, alienated them from the masses, and greatly affected the masses' enthusiasm for production. The circular pointed out that the reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) Cadres still harbor the left-leaning, reckless idea of "rather be left than right" and a simplistic view of relying solely on poor peasants. (2) The seriousness of policy implementation is insufficient. There is no prior consultation or subsequent reporting. More than ten days passed after these two incidents occurred, and the prefectural committee only heard about them then; the county committee had not yet reported them. After inquiring with the county committee, the report was still not submitted in a timely manner. (3) County and district leaders have not sufficiently studied Comrade Ren Bishi's report and various instructions from the Central Bureau, and the instructions of the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee. Their leadership thinking is not clear, especially in terms of the education of district and village cadres. The spirit of the Party's policies has not been clearly explained. It is required that each county use various meeting formats to convene village cadre conferences to clearly explain the various reports and instructions on rectification and implement the spirit. (4) Cadres do not conduct thorough work, do not understand the actual situation, and do not study the genuine demands of the masses; instead, they start from the wishes of a few active elements and commit an acute illness. Although these two incidents have already attracted the attention of the Yicheng and Xiangling County Committees, and specific handling methods have been discussed, we believe that the Xiangling County Committee and the work team do not fully recognize the seriousness of this error. In the rectification, they only explained that the method of beating people was not good, was wrong, but did not recognize that this was a matter of principle, especially in regard to the middle peasant issue, which did not receive sufficient attention. The attitude towards the work team in Shangxiliang was also not made clear. The work team must re-examine itself, enhance the seriousness of policy implementation, overcome indiscipline, and oppose liberalism that violates policies. In the future, incidents of policy violations must be reported promptly, and a reporting system for districts and villages must be established.

  　太岳二地委指责襄陵翼城打人错误
    【太岳消息】中共太岳二地委通报指责翼城营底村和襄陵上西梁村，坚持左倾蛮干错误和继续侵犯中农利益，继续吊打中农现象，要求县委严格检查，彻底纠正。翼城二区农会常委杨豪人于四月二十三日到营底工作，二十四日就和村干部郝春奎、高景文等，先把中农高景礼提高为富农成份，领导群众斗争拖打了一顿。中农郝立凤曾要求杨豪人纠正，杨不接受，反说“不准使用肉刑是拥护地主的办法。”第二天继续拖打。一直闹了五天，最后把高景礼扫地出门，财产全部没收。并在斗争中牵连到高景有，把高景有病着的女人也吓死了。襄陵五区上西梁基点住着十几个县区干部，也发生了打人事件。被打的有三个人，一个叫梁刀庆，是富农，群众要向他借粮二十石，他说他只能拿五石，就说他不投降，打了一顿。甚至把他的雇工福龙也打了一顿。另一个挨打的叫邓七斤，打的时候群众就说，现在法令不叫打人；可是工作组同志说：“法令还不是由人规定吗？”（另一人被打不详）这两件事情发生后，附近村庄听到，对党的政策又发生和增加了怀疑，有的村也想跟着打人，给今后工作增加了不少困难。在营底、上西梁本村，更加形成贫雇的孤立，脱离群众，并大大影响了群众生产情绪。通报中指出这种现象产生的原因是：（一）干部思想上仍然存在着“宁左勿右”的左倾冒险思想及单纯雇贫观点。（二）执行政策的严肃性不够。事先不请示，事后不报告。这两件事发生了十多天，地委听说后，县委还没报告。后询问县委，还未及时报告。（三）由于县区领导上对任弼时同志的报告及对中央局的各种指示、区党委和地委的指示研究不够，领导思想不明确，尤其对区村干部教育不够，没有讲清楚党的政策精神。要求各县通过各种会议形式，召开村干部大会，把纠偏的各种报告和指示讲解清楚，把精神贯彻下去。（四）干部工作不深入，不去了解实际情况，研究群众的真正要求；而是从少数积极分子的愿望出发，犯了急性病。这两件事情发生后，虽然已引起翼城和襄陵县委会的注意，并讨论出处理的具体办法；但我们觉得襄陵县委会和工作组对这一错误的严重性尚认识不足。在纠正中只是说明打人的办法不好，不对，而未认清这是原则的错误，尤其是在中农问题上没有引起足够的注意，对上西梁的工作组，也未表明态度。工作组必须重新进行检查，提高政策的严肃性，克服无纪律性，反对违犯政策的自由主义，今后违犯政策的事情，必须迅速报告，建立区村的报告制度。
