Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Comprehensive reports: The conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, under the instigation of sinister Anglo-American imperialist diplomatic policies, has erupted into a formal war. Since the evening of May 14th, when the Jewish people realized their long-held and just desire to restore their nation and declared the establishment of the State of Israel, the armies of seven Arab countries, including Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, totaling approximately 50,000 to 60,000, have launched a large-scale invasion of Palestine from the north, south, and east, vowing to overthrow the State of Israel. To date, they have occupied the Arab areas of Palestine and besieged the city of Jerusalem. The Jewish people are rising up to wage a resolute and just resistance, with both sides employing aircraft, resulting in extremely fierce battles.

The outbreak of this war is primarily the result of instigation by British imperialism. British imperialism, while announcing its "abandonment of the Mandate over Palestine," immediately sent its Middle East spy chief, Clayton, to sign various secret agreements with the reactionary governments of Arab countries, agreeing to divide Palestine among them and inciting the reactionary rulers of these countries to prepare for and carry out this anti-Jewish war. The main force of the Arab armies invading Palestine is equipped with British weapons, trained and commanded by British officers, and supported by the British Treasury. Many of the soldiers are composed of troops from the Polish exiled fascist Anders' army and former Nazi prisoners of war. Britain's aim is to use the Arab reactionary group headed by King Abdullah of Jordan to maintain its actual rule in Palestine and even the Middle East.

This attempt by British imperialism conflicts with the expansionist activities that American aggressors are actively pursuing in the Middle East. Therefore, with the outbreak and expansion of the Arab-Jewish war, contradictions between Britain and the United States have also intensified. On the 17th, when the Security Council discussed the Palestinian issue, the United States proposed that the Security Council invoke Article 37 of the United Nations Charter, declare the situation in Palestine as a threat to peace, and order both sides to cease fire by the Security Council. If the belligerent countries refuse to comply, diplomatic, economic, and even military sanctions would be used to enforce it. On the 22nd, the chairman of the US Senate Appropriations Committee threatened to investigate whether Britain was using US aid to support the Arab army. On the 25th, when Truman met with Israeli President Weizmann, he further indicated that he could consider providing Israel with loans of 90 million to 100 million US dollars and lifting the arms embargo on Palestine.

At the same time, the United States launched a strong propaganda offensive against Britain. However, just as the United States' past fickle and perfidious stance on the Palestinian issue failed to prevent the Arab-Jewish conflict, the United States' current action of supporting the Jewish people cannot prevent the Arab-Jewish war. The United States' position is not based on righteousness; its purpose is only to intimidate Britain and force the latter to make concessions as a means of further penetrating Palestine. Therefore, its solemn proposal in the Security Council is nothing more than a pose. Only the representatives of the Soviet Union and Ukraine, recognizing that the actual implementation of the US proposal would be in the interest of peace in the Near East, firmly supported it. When a vote was taken on the 22nd, after the US original proposal to invoke Article 39 of the United Nations Charter was rejected, it immediately voted in favor of a proposal requiring both sides to implement a ceasefire within 36 hours starting at midnight on the 23rd. However, this hypocritical proposal without the backing of sanctions could not be implemented in practice due to the opposition of the Arab side. Therefore, on the 27th, the Soviet Union once again demanded sanctions against Arab countries in the Security Council.

　　在英美罪恶外交政策鼓动下
  　近东阿犹两族爆发战争
    英美矛盾顿趋尖锐苏联同情以色列国遭侵略
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人和犹太人的冲突，在英美帝国主义罪恶外交政策的鼓动之下，已经爆发成为正式的战争。自五月十四日晚，犹太民族实现了他们长期正义的复国愿望，宣告成立以色列国之时起，外约旦、埃及、叙利亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等七个阿拉伯国家的军队，约五、六万人，即在自南北东三面大举侵入巴境，扬言推翻以色列国，迄今已占领巴境阿拉伯区，包围耶路撒冷城。犹太人方面正起而作坚决的正义的抵抗，双方出以飞机，战况至为惨烈。这个战争的爆发，首先是英帝国主义策动的结果。英帝国主义在宣布“放弃对巴勒斯坦委任统治的同时，即派其中东间谍头子克莱顿，与阿拉伯各国反动政府先后订立了各种秘密协定，同意将巴勒斯坦分割给他们，挑动这些国家的反动统治者，准备和进行这次反犹战争。这次侵入巴境的阿拉伯军队的主力，便是由英国武器所装备，被英国军官训练与指挥、由英国财政部供养的外约旦的军队。其中有许多士兵，且是波兰流亡法西斯安德斯的军队和前纳粹俘虏改编而成的。英国的目的，在于利用以外约旦国王阿布杜拉为首的阿拉伯反动集团，来保持它在巴勒斯坦以至对中东的实际统治。英帝国这一企图，对于美国侵略者在中东所积极进行的扩张活动，是互相冲突的。因此随着阿犹战争之爆发与扩大、英美间的矛盾亦随之尖锐化起来。十七日，安理会讨论巴勒斯坦问题时，美国提议安理会援用联合国宪章第三十七条的规定，宣布巴境形势为对和平的威胁，并由安理会下令双方停战。如交战国拒不遵行时，即使用外交、经济，以至军事的制裁，予以强迫执行。二十二日，美参院拨款委员会主席，扬言将调查英国是否用美援支持阿拉伯军。二十五日，杜鲁门接见以色列总统迪兹曼时，更表示可考虑给以色列贷款九千万至一亿美元，和解除对巴勒斯坦的军火禁运。与此同时，美国并对英国发动了强烈的宣传攻势。但是正如过去美国对巴勒斯坦问题的变化无常、背信弃义，不能制止阿犹的冲突一样，美国这一次的声援犹太人的行动，也不能制止阿犹的战争。美国的立场并不是出于道议，其目的只在于吓唬英国，迫使后者让步，作为进一步伸入巴勒斯坦的手段。因而它在安理会上的严正提案，就不过是一种姿态。只有苏联与乌克兰的代表，鉴于美国提案的真实执行，将能符合于近东和平利益，才予以坚决支持。当二十二日进行表决时，美国在其原案中援用联合国宪章第三十九条一节被否决后，随即投票赞成了要求双方自二十三日午夜起，三十六小时内实行停战的提案。但是这个没有制裁作后盾的伪善议案，由于阿拉伯方面的反对，实际无法执行。因此，苏联在二十七日安理会上，重新要求对于阿拉伯各国实行制裁。
