　　No Waste of People's Strength Allowed
  　Seize the Time After Rain to Harvest Wheat and Weed Seedlings
    邯郸 Municipal Party Committee Issues Urgent Instructions to Stop Labor Service and Not Miss the Farming Season
    [Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] After the fourth thorough rain in Handan, Wu'an and other places on the 7th, government and civilian cadres have been leading and helping the masses in the tense harvest of wheat and weeding of seedlings. The Handan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent instruction on the 8th, calling on all agencies and troops to lead and help the masses to harvest the wheat and plant late seedlings within seven days. The regulations are as follows: First, during the busy farming season, all agencies and troops stationed in the area must stop labor service. If there is an urgent wartime task that requires labor service, it must be approved by the Municipal Committee. Second, in the next seven days, all agencies and troops, except for a very small number of staff members who will continue to work, will withdraw the vast majority of their personnel and all livestock and vehicles to help the masses harvest wheat and plant late seedlings. Third, for the masses who have difficulties with seeds and farm tools, each district will quickly lend them. For landlords who have been liquidated and have difficulties in production, each district will also provide appropriate solutions. As of the 8th, the wheat in the drylands of Handan had been harvested, with only the wheat on the banks of the Fuyang River yet to be harvested. Early seedlings in Handan and the Southern Hebei District are already a foot high and are in need of weeding after the thorough rain. The Handan Municipal Committee's seven-day plan is to strive to help the masses harvest the wheat and plant the late seedlings within five days, and then quickly lead the masses to weed the early seedlings. The Xingtai Municipal Committee and the Wu'an County Committee have also successively made arrangements to lead the masses in production. After the rectification and training of village cadres and the correction of errors in Guangping and Yuanchao in Southern Hebei... Yangcheng and Jincheng in Taiyue... Wu'an and Pingshun in Taihang and other counties, they have returned to their villages and actively taken the lead in leading production. According to the inspection of the third and fourth districts of Wu'an, only a few old village cadres are still passive, and the vast majority of cadres have strengthened their leadership of the masses to rectify mutual aid groups in a democratic way and carry out harvesting and planting of late seedlings. After the Pingshun branch and cadre joint meeting, the village cadres returned to their villages to implement the spirit of education and transformation of party members at the branch and cadre joint meeting, and successively held branch party member meetings to strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses and strengthen the party branch's leadership over the production movement. According to a report from more than 100 village cadres to the county committee, they have great confidence in leading the great production movement to strive for a bumper harvest this year. Now that all parts of the border area are entering the most tense stage of production, all localities must cherish the people's strength and must not waste it in the slightest. It is heard that on the main roads of Wu'an, some agencies, not for the needs of the front, are forcibly assigning labor and demanding livestock and labor regardless of the production of the masses. This is wrong. Local governments should stop this and conduct inspections in accordance with the spirit of the border government's proclamation.

　　不准浪费半点民力
  　雨后抓紧麦收锄苗
    邯郸市委紧急指示不误农时停止支差
    【本报综合消息】邯郸、武安等地于七日下完第四次透雨，政民干部纷纷领导与帮助群众紧张麦收锄苗。邯郸中共市委会八日发出紧急指示，号召各机关部队在七天以内领导与帮助群众把麦子割完，把晚苗种上。规定第一、在农忙期间，驻地各机关部队一律停止支差。如有紧急战勤任务需要支差，须经市委会批准。第二、在最近七天中，各机关部队除留极数工作人员坚持工作外，其余绝大部分人员和全部牲口车辆抽出去，帮助群众收麦和种晚苗。第三、种籽农具困难的群众，由各区迅速借给。被清算过的地主生产困难者，亦由各区予以适当解决。截至八日，邯郸旱地麦子已割完，只有滏阳河岸水地麦子尚未收割。邯郸及冀南区早苗已盈尺高，透雨后，尤待锄耘。邯郸市委会七天计划，正争取在五天内帮助群众把麦子收完，晚苗种罢，迅速领导群众转入锄早苗。邢台市委与武安县委等亦相继布置领导群众生产。冀南广平、元朝……，太岳阳城、晋城……，太行武安、平顺等县经过整训村干和纠编后，纷纷回村，积极带头领导生产。据武安三、四区检查只有少数旧村干部尚消极，绝大部分干部加强领导群众以民主方式整顿互助组，进行收割和种晚苗。平顺支干联席会议后，各村干回村贯彻支干联席会教育改造党员精神，纷纷召开支部党员会，密切干群关系，加强支部对生产运动的领导，据一百多村干致书县委会汇报：对领导大生产运动争取今年丰收颇有信心。现在边区各地正进入最紧张的生产阶段，各地要十分爱护民力，千万不可有半点浪费，听说武安大路上还有些机关不是为了前方需要竟不顾群众生产强行派差要牲口要夫，这是不对的，各地政府应按边府布告精神予以制止并进行检查。
