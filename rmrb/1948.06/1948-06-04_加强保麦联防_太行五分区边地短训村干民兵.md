The recent situation and experiences in protecting the wheat harvest in various counties in the border areas of the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district are as follows: (1) Each county has held short-term training classes for militia and village cadres, first solving the problem of militia and cadres lying down and not working, mobilizing cadres and militia to actively protect the wheat harvest, and seeking unified leadership. Through mobilizing cadres, widespread ideological mobilization for protecting the wheat harvest is carried out among the masses. Furthermore, mass-based summaries are conducted of past experiences and lessons learned from enemy grain seizures, mobilizing the masses to prepare for the wheat harvest early. The training content for the border area militia focuses on current affairs education to boost morale and strengthen confidence in protecting the wheat harvest. Training methods vary according to local conditions, generally taking two forms: one is centralized training by county on a rotating basis, which takes longer, about seven to ten days, and achieves greater results. The other is to gather militia and cadres from nearby villages, after breakfast, concentrated in selected villages as the unit of the district or joint defense, going back at dark, lasting for two to three days. After training, the morale of militia and cadres in various places has begun to improve, and they are determined to protect the wheat.

(2) Regarding the organizational work for protecting the wheat harvest, each county has improved and strengthened joint defense, and established county, district, and sub-command organizations according to natural conditions and the struggle situation, with leading cadres assigned specific tasks. Village organizational structures have also begun to be established, with some villages setting up informants, organizing the elderly and women to gather intelligence, and organizing plainclothes teams to disguise themselves and scout enemy situations ahead, using both covert and overt methods.

The next step is to mobilize the masses to organize mutual aid and support each other on a voluntary basis. Large-scale mutual aid is adopted on the front lines, and past experiences are taken into account to avoid chaotic grabbing and harvesting. Second and third lines form voluntary groups, and a relatively complete organizational leadership structure is established to facilitate command. Each district, according to different situations, organizes rear support for the front from the district or joint defense, identifying support targets in advance and determining conditions and wages. In order to achieve rapid harvesting and solve the tool problem, the government loans out sickles (as in Anyang).

(3) Work in three types of areas. In the first line, the enemy-occupied dominant areas, the enemy's main task is requisitioning, so the main focus is on combining legal and illegal struggles. Currently, in addition to militia and work teams going deep behind enemy lines to conduct propaganda, mobilize young adults to avoid conscription, organize rush harvests, or sell labor, they are educated in advance, given weapons, and resist grain and conscription, conducting illegal struggles for armed self-defense. In addition, peasants are organized to collude and petition the enemy for food, laying the foundation for legal struggle during the wheat harvest. The second line is the focus of enemy-us contention. In these areas, in addition to mobilizing and organizing the masses, the main focus is on resolving the issue of combining labor and military affairs. The organizational form is often a combination of guerrilla groups and production groups (as in Jixian): no production when the enemy is not present; fight when the enemy comes. In terms of methods, the active and aggressive approach is to attack the enemy who is seizing wheat during the day and organize full-scale rush harvesting at night. The method adopted is labor exchange, with some specifying specific methods. For example, Jixian stipulates that one day of combat at the front is worth twelve points, one day of production in the rear is worth ten points, and militia combat at the front has special personnel responsible for farming and harvesting at home, so they can fight the enemy with peace of mind. The third line (i.e., areas where we have the advantage) estimates that in addition to large-scale enemy surprise raids, small-scale raids and the organization of special agents and plainclothes to burn wheat stacks are also possible. In addition to organizing joint defense to combat small groups of enemies, Zhangnan also mobilized the masses to thresh locally to speed up the process, preparing water tanks and soil in the fields, and organizing guards to prevent enemy plainclothes agents from burning wheat stacks, and proposed striving for early harvesting to support the front.

After our in-depth mobilization, the masses have great hopes for protecting the wheat harvest and are automatically expanding the militia and digging cave dwellings to actively protect the wheat harvest. The masses in the ×× Gang area of the Ninth District of Anyang requested the establishment of an armed company, and seven poor and middle-class youths in the Second District of Yexian requested weapons to go back and hold their positions. The struggle to protect the wheat harvest is about to enter a tense stage.

　　加强保麦联防
  　太行五分区边地短训村干民兵
    太行五分区边地各县近来保卫麦收情况和点滴经验如下：（一）各县均召开了短期的民兵、村干部训练班，首先解决民兵、干部躺倒不干思想，把干部民兵动员起来，积极保卫麦收，求得领导力量的统一，通过动员干部，在群众中进行广泛的保卫麦收的思想动员。并进行群众性的总结过去敌人抢粮的经验教训，动员群众早作收麦准备。边地民兵训练内容，以时事教育提高斗志，加强保卫麦收信心。训练方式按各地不同情况，一般采取两种办法：一种是以县为单位，轮流集中训练，这样的整训时间较长，约七天到十天，成绩也较大。另一种是以区或联防为单位，选择适中村庄，召集附近村民兵、干部，早饭后集中，天黑回去，时间是两三天。经过训练后，各地民兵、干部，情绪已开始好转，决心保麦。
    （二）保卫麦收的组织工作，各县都健全和加强了联防，并按自然条件及斗争形势，分设县区及分指挥部的组织，领导干部进行具体分工。各村的组织机构也开始建立，有的村设情报员，组织老人妇女担任情报，和组织便衣队化装到前边探敌情，密秘的和公开的两套。
    其次是发动群众在自愿的要求下组织互助，互相支援。在第一线采取较大规模的互助，并接受过去经验，不能乱抢乱收。第二、三线以自愿结合小组，并组织一套较完整的组织领导机构，便于指挥，各区按不同情况，组织以区或联防的后方支援前方，预先找好支援对象，定出条件和工资。为了要作到快收，解决工具问题，政府贷给镰刀一部（如安阳）。
    （三）三种地区的工作。在第一线即敌占优势区，这类地区，敌人主要是征收，因此，主要是合法斗争结合非法斗争。目前，除民兵、武工队深入敌后进行宣传，动员青壮年为避免抓丁、组织抢收，或卖工，事先教育好，给他弄武器，抗粮抗丁，进行非法斗争武装自卫。此外，组织农民串通起来，回去向敌人请愿要饭吃，打下麦收时与敌进行合法斗争的基础。第二线是敌我争夺的焦点，这些地区除发动组织群众外，主要是解决劳武结合问题，组织形式，多采取游击小组和生产小组相结合（如汲县），敌人不来生产；敌人来了就打。白天主动积极打击敌人抢麦，黑夜组织全力抢收。方法上是采取变工，有的并规定了具体办法。如汲县规定前方作战出击一天顶十二分，后方生产一天十分，民兵出击家里生产规定有专人负责耕种收割，使安心对敌斗争。第三线（即我占优势区），估计敌人以大股突袭抢劫外，还可能小股奔袭，和组织特务、便衣烧麦堆，除组织联防打击小股敌人外，如漳南又动员群众当地碾场，以便快打，场里准备水缸和土，组织看场等办法，以防止敌人便衣特务烧麦堆，并提出争取早收，支援前方。
    经过我们的深入动员，群众对保卫麦收抱着很大希望，为积极保卫麦收，自动扩大民兵，打窑洞。安阳九区××岗群众，要求成立一个连武装，邺县二区七个贫中青年，要求发给武器回去坚持阵地。保卫麦收斗争，即将进入紧张阶段。
