　　The People's Liberation Army Has Won a Great Victory
　　--For Rooftop Broadcasts and Public Blackboards

　　In the past few days, our People's Liberation Army has won several great victories in the Central Plains and Central Shanxi.

　　In the Central Plains, our People's Liberation Army captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, on the 22nd. Kaifeng is the largest city in Henan, with a population of 400,000. When we attacked, Chiang Kai-shek could not provide assistance, and we captured it in six days. The Chiang troops defending the city, as well as the Nationalist provincial government, provincial party headquarters, and other large and small organizations, were completely wiped out, with 20,000 captured alive. We now control 300 li of the central section of the Longhai Railway. In central Shanxi, our North China People's Liberation Army used powerful forces to attack Linfen, and moved north along the Fen-Tong-Jiang Road. From the 11th to the 24th, we recovered Lingshi County and successively annihilated two divisions of Yan Xishan's bandit troops in Zhanglan and Hongshan. Of the 105 counties in Shanxi Province, Yan's bandits now only have 14 isolated cities left. Our offensive is still developing.

　　解放军打了大胜仗
    ——供屋顶广播、大众黑板用
    这几天，咱们解放军在中原和晋中接连打了几个大胜仗。
    在中原，咱们解放军在二十二号打下了河南的省城开封。开封是河南的第一座大城，有人口四十万。当咱们进攻时，蒋介石干着又不能援助，六天工夫就叫咱打下来了。守城的蒋军和国民党省政府、省党部等大小机关全部被歼灭，光活捉的就有两万人。现在咱们控制了陇海中路中段三百里。在山西中部，咱们华北人民解放军打临汾的强大兵力，汾同蒋路北上，从十一日到二十四日，收复了灵石县，接连着在张兰洪善两个地方，全部消灭了阎匪锡山的两个师。山西全省有一百零五县，阎匪现在只剩下十四座孤城，咱们的攻势还在发展中。
