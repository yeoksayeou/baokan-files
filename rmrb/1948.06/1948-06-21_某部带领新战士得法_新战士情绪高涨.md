[From the North China Front, 14th] A certain unit of the Field Army has effectively led new recruits, and their morale is rising daily. After the new recruits arrived in various units, they were not only welcomed, comforted, and given supplies, but also received meticulous care in every aspect. Veteran soldiers also recognized that the key to consolidating new recruits is to lead them effectively in combat. Before the battle, veteran soldiers of the 3rd Machine Gun Company of a certain unit studied methods for leading new recruits. Then, at the squad meeting, they expressed that they would first dig fortifications for the new recruits to prevent them from being injured, assess the terrain, and then let the new recruits advance. During retreat, the new recruits would go first. They vowed that they would stay with the new recruits, guaranteeing they would bring them back safely. As soon as new recruits Wang Zhiming, Chen Guoying, and Li Zhiying heard this, they immediately chose veteran soldiers Wang Shuming, Wang Chaobin, and Gao Yinsheng as their leaders. Before the battle, the veteran soldiers took every opportunity to teach them how to shoot, throw grenades, and share their combat experience. When crossing the railway, they taught them to do it as quickly as possible. Before disrupting communications, they drew diagrams and used sticks to teach them the methods. When the battle started, they let the new recruits occupy the well-dug fortifications first, and told them where the enemy was. New recruit Yang Bingwan of the 3rd Squad, 2nd Machine Gun Company, trembled with fear at the sound of cannons. Deputy Squad Leader Chen Zhenmei told him, "Don't be afraid, just take good cover and relax your body, and you'll be fine!" Some new recruits were even afraid of our own artillery, so the veteran soldiers told them how to distinguish between our artillery and the enemy's, and how to act under different firepower, so they could follow the veteran soldiers' example and not panic. After the ×× battle, the new recruits calmed down and felt that they had nothing to fear with the veteran soldiers around. New Party member soldiers Li Ming and Ran Zuoting of the 9th Company, and new Party member soldier Wei Chunfeng of the 4th Company, resolutely requested to participate in the battle and not stay in the rear. Some new recruits not only calmed themselves but also explained the situation to those who were afraid.

　　某部带领新战士得法
  　新战士情绪高涨
    【华北前线十四日电】野战军某部带领新战士得法，新战士情绪日益高涨。新战士到各部后，不但得到欢迎、安慰和赠送用品，而且处处受到体贴入微的照顾。老战士们并认识到：新战士的巩固关键是带领他们作战得法。某部三机连老战士，战前研究了带领新战士的办法，然后在班务会上，表示他们一定先给薪战士挖好工事不叫他们受伤，看好地形，再让新战士前进，撤退则让新战士先走。有他们就有新战士，保管带去带回来。新战士王志明、陈国英、李志英一听见，马上就选上老战士王树明、王朝斌、高银声作带领人。战前，老战士有空就教他们打枪、投弹，讲作战经验。过铁路时，教他愈快愈好。破交前，画着图，扎着棍教他们做法。打起仗来，工事挖得好好的让他们先占，告诉他敌人在哪里。某部二机连三班新战士杨炳万，听见炮响就吓得浑身抖抖，副班长陈振美就告诉他：“别怕，只要很好的掩蔽，身体舒展开就没事！”有些新战士听见咱们的炮也怕，老战士就告诉他怎样去辨别我们或敌人的炮声，在什么火力下，怎样动作，让他们跟着老战士一样做，不要慌乱。经过××战斗，新战士们沉着气了，觉得有老战士就不怕。某部九连新党员战士李明、冉作庭和四连新党员战士魏春风并坚决要求参加战斗，不在后方。有些新战士不但自己沉着气，而且看见害怕的就给他解释。
