Unable to Make a Living in the KMT-Controlled Areas
Everyone Gets a Share Upon Returning to the Liberated Areas
Businessmen and Residents of Wu'an Return Home One After Another

Merchants and farmers from Wu'an County who made a living in various cities in the KMT-controlled areas, finding it difficult to survive due to rising prices, and having recently heard from friends that everyone would receive a share of land in their hometown after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, have been bringing their families, young and old, escaping the rule of the KMT areas and returning to their hometown after overcoming numerous difficulties. More than ten families have returned from Shenyang one after another, including Fang Sanke from Boyan and Sun Hetang's wife from Dong Kongbi; Xu Guanliang from Boyan and others have returned from Kaifeng. Fang Sanke from Boyan fled to Shenyang, Northeast China, with his wife and children during the famine in 1942, making a living by selling mixed noodles. Last autumn and winter, because the grain in Shenyang city was forcibly requisitioned by the KMT bandit army, the price of grain in the city soared. This spring, the price of mixed noodles rose from 10,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan in circulation coupons per catty (each yuan equivalent to 20 yuan of KMT currency), making it impossible to maintain a livelihood. In addition, the KMT bandits were conscripting soldiers, making life even more unbearable. Later, after hearing that "the Communist Party has issued the Land Law Outline, and the people in the Liberated Areas all have land to cultivate," he decided to return to the Liberated Areas! After passing through Tianjin, he went back around the Liberated Areas via Dezhou, Shandong. When they arrived in Dezhou, because the children had been walking for more than a month and could not walk any further, and they did not have enough travel expenses, they happened to meet two comrades from our Pengcheng Production Department who were driving carts. After explaining the situation, these two comrades allowed him to ride home at a reduced fare. After arriving home, the village cadres inquired about the situation and immediately gave him forty catties of millet for temporary consumption and arranged housing for him. He shed tears of joy and said, "I am happy that the Liberated Areas treat people so well; the tears are because I remember the suffering I endured in the KMT-controlled areas." Kong Hetang from Dong Kongbi fled to Shenyang with her husband and two children after the Japanese devils occupied Wu'an in 1938, making a living by doing some needlework. Later, her husband died of illness, making life even more difficult. In addition to the high price of rice, three thousand yuan per catty this spring, she could not find work, and they ate one meal and did not know where the next one would come from. Later, after hearing from Wu'an villagers that "land at home is divided equally, and everyone has a share," she organized nineteen families to return. When they arrived in Dezhou, the municipal government issued them certificates. Every time they arrived at a village, the village farmers' association would take them to the refugee reception center for meals, treating them like family. It was like this all the way. Also: Xu Guanliang from Boyan, who is now fifty-five years old, also returned from Kaifeng city on the 19th of last month. He had always relied on operating a small business to make a living. In the past, he did not understand the actual situation in the Liberated Areas and dared not return. Recently, after hearing that the landlord Pei Zigang from Boyan (who ran to Anyang during the mass movement) had returned from Anyang, and the village farmers' association had given him sixty catties of grain to live on and produce, he also returned immediately. According to him, the people of Wu'an who do business in Kaifeng all want to go home. The price of millet in Kaifeng city is three thousand yuan per catty, and a foot of cloth costs one hundred thousand yuan, making it impossible to survive. They all want to return to the Liberated Areas.

　　在蒋管区无法维持生活
    回解放区每人能分一份
  　武安商民纷纷返乡
    武安县在蒋管区各城市经商谋生的商人农民，由于物价上涨，难以渡日，近又听友人相传家乡自公布土地法大纲每人要分一份土地，纷纷扶老携幼，逃出蒋区统治，经过重重困难，于最近返回故乡。先后从沈阳回来的有伯延房三科，东孔壁孙何堂妻等十余家，从开封回来的有伯延徐观良等。伯延房三科在四二年灾荒时，带着老婆孩子逃往东北沈阳，卖杂面维持生活。去年秋冬，因沈阳城内的粮都叫蒋匪军强征了，城内粮价暴涨，至今春，每斤杂面由一万元又涨到一万五千元流通券（每元合蒋币二十元），生活无法维持，再加上蒋匪抓兵，更无法生活。后听说“共产党发了土地法大纲，解放区的老百姓每人都有地种”，便下决心回解放区来！经过天津，由山东德州经解放区绕着往回走。到德州，因小孩在路上步走了一个多月，再走不动，车费又不够，恰巧遇上我彭城生产部的两个赶车的同志，经说明来由，这两个同志便允许他廉价坐车回家。到家后，村干部就去问询情况，马上给了他四十斤小米，暂且吃用，随时又给安排房子。他高兴的流下泪来说：“高兴的是解放区对待人这样好；流泪是想起在蒋管区受的罪。”东孔壁孔何堂于二十七年日寇攻占武安后，跟他男人及两个孩子逃往沈阳，靠做些针线渡日。后来她男人病死，生活更困难，再加米粮昂贵，今春一斤米三万元，又找不下活做，吃了这顿没那顿。后来听武安乡亲说：“家里平分土地每人有一份”，才串连了十九家回来。到了德州，市政府给开了证明，每到一村，村农会便领到难民招待所管饭吃，一家人一样的亲热，一路上都是这样。又：伯延徐观良，现年五十五岁，也在上月十九日，由开封城里回来了。他一向靠经营小商业维持生活，以前不了解解放区实际情况，不敢回来。最近听说伯延地主裴子刚（在群运时跑到安阳）由安阳回来了，村农会还给了他六十斤粮食，叫他生活生产，他也就马上回来了。据他说，武安人在开封做买卖的都想回家，开封城里每斤小米三万元，一尺布十万元，都没法活，都愿回解放区来。
