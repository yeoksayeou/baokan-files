Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th—In the industrial construction of the Northeast Liberated Areas, the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" campaign has been widely launched. The old concept of veteran workers "holding back some skills when teaching apprentices" has disappeared in many basic area factories. In the past, some enterprises, due to the lack of correct guidelines for the workers' movement, had some biases in the relationship between teachers and apprentices, which affected the unity of young workers and veteran workers and the improvement of industrial production. For example, veteran workers at the Harbin Publicly-Operated Experimental Factory once said: "Young workers regard us as 'backward elements', and if we say something wrong, they say we are 'pro-Manchukuo faction'. The trade union and the administration also believe in the young workers, so we can't do anything." Some said: "It is certainly wrong for us not to teach the young workers the techniques, but they do not respect us, so we are really unwilling to teach them." Since the leadership organs in various places paid attention to correcting these phenomena, many young workers have made self-criticism, and the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" campaign has been enthusiastically launched in the great production movement. The Harbin Railway Bureau's Locomotive Section held a meeting to respect the elderly and established a close unity between the new and veteran workers. The Experimental Factory also held a meeting for teachers and apprentices. At the meeting, young workers admitted their past mistakes and put forward the slogans of "Respect teachers, love teachers, and help teachers" and "Learn good skills to produce more"; and guaranteed that in the future they would: "Go to work early, leave work late, tidy up tools, fetch water and sweep the floor, help the teacher, listen to the teacher's education, and learn from the teacher." Young workers in the tram factory even proposed: "Whoever has the technology is the teacher, and all teachers should be respected"; "If you learn it yourself, you should immediately pass it on to others." The Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League called on young league members to strive to unite with veteran workers. At the beginning, individual veteran workers in the city's burlap sack factory looked down on young workers. When veteran workers were sick, the Youth League members among the young workers did their best to help them, getting up in the middle of the night to ask doctors, boil water, and make medicine, which moved the veteran workers and changed their old attitude. The young league members of Juxingcheng Iron Factory helped the teachers do odd jobs, and also explained the war situation to the veteran workers and helped the veteran workers study current affairs. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau's Electrical Section, Boketu (Hingan Province) Inspection Section, etc., also launched the "Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices" campaign. The veteran workers have set up plans to bring apprentices, proposing: "Move out the bottom of the old box and teach wholeheartedly." Since the launch of this campaign, the unity of factory workers in various places has been strengthened, the atmosphere of technical research has been strong, and the young workers have made rapid progress.

In order to further establish this new atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, the Northeast Daily specially published a commentary pointing out: "Today, the relationship between teachers and apprentices in the factories of the liberated areas is actually the relationship between veteran workers and new workers, and the relationship between workers who have mastered technology and workers who have not mastered technology. The contradictions between teachers and apprentices in the old society no longer exist. Their common requirement is to increase production in order to improve the people's living standards and support the war. Therefore, what they need is technical exchange and mutual assistance. For veteran workers who have mastered technology, they must enthusiastically and unreservedly teach all their skills to other workers; for workers who have not mastered technology, they must humbly and sincerely learn from veteran workers." The newspaper also stated: "The reason why the 'Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices' campaign is important is also because the industry and mining of the liberated areas are being restored and constructed on a large scale. The number of new workers is constantly increasing, and they must rely on the leadership of veteran workers to improve rapidly. The apprenticeship plans drawn up by veteran workers, teaching what to do and learning while doing in actual work, is a practical educational method that is worth promoting."

### 东北发展工矿业建设　开展“尊师爱徒”运动  哈市青工团员团结老工友

　　东北发展工矿业建设
  　开展“尊师爱徒”运动
    哈市青工团员团结老工友
    【新华社东北廿四日电】东北解放区工业建设中已普遍展开“尊师爱徒”运动。老工人“教徒弟要留一手”的旧观念，在许多基本区工厂中已不复存在。过去某些企业中由于没有掌握正确的职工运动方针，在师徒关系上曾产生过若干偏向，以致影响青年工人和老工人的团结与工业生产的提高。如哈尔滨公营实验工厂的老工人曾说：“青工把我们看成“落后分子”，说话不对就说我们是“伪满派”。工会和行政上也都相信青工，我们就什么都不行。”有的说：“我们不把技术教给青工自然不对，但是他们对我们不尊重，因此也实在不愿意教他们。”自各地领导机关注意矫正这些现象后，许多青工纷纷作自我批评，“尊师爱徒”运动就在大生产运动中热烈展开。哈尔滨铁路局机务段曾召开敬老会，建立了新老工人的亲密团结，实验工厂也召开了师徒会，会上青工承认过去的过错，提出“尊师、爱师、助师”，“学好手艺才能多生产”的口号；并保证今后作到：“早上班、晚下班，收拾工具，打水扫地，为师傅帮忙，听师傅教育，向师傅学习。”电车厂青工更提出：“有技术就是师傅，是师傅都要尊敬”；“自己学会了也立刻传授别人”。哈市毛泽东青年团号召青工团员努力团结老工友。该市麻袋工厂初时还有个别老工友看不起青工，当老工友生病时，青工中的青年团员都尽心扶侍，半夜起来请医生、烧水、冲药，使老工友感动，改变了旧的态度。聚兴成铁工厂的青工团员帮助师傅做零活，还给老工人们讲解战争形势，帮助老工人学习时事。齐齐哈尔铁路局电务段、博克图（兴安省）检车段等也展开了“尊师爱徒”运动，老工人纷纷订出了带徒弟计划，提出：“把老箱子底搬出来尽心教。”这一运动开展以来，各地工厂职人团结加强，技术研究空气浓厚，青工进步很快。
    为了进一步树立这种尊师爱徒的新的风气，东北日报特著论指出：“今天解放区工厂中的师徒关系，实际上就是老工友与新工友的关系，掌握技术工友与未掌握技术工友的关系。旧社会中那种师徒之间的矛盾已经不存在了。他们之间的共同要求是增加生产，以便改善人民生活，支援战争。因之他们需要的是技术交流与互相帮助。对掌握技术的老工友来说，必须是热心的毫无保留的将一切本领教给其他工友；对未掌握技术的工友来说，必须是虚心的诚恳的向老工友学习。”该报并称：“尊师爱徒运动之所以重要，还由于解放区工矿业正在大规模恢复与建设。新工友的人数不断增加，必须依靠老工友的带领，他们才能迅速提高。老工友订出的带徒计划，在实际工作中做什么教什么，边做边学，就是一种切实的教育方法，值得推广。”
