Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to various sources, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army is conducting frantic conscription in various areas under Chiang's control, exacerbating the chaos in Chiang-controlled areas. According to an Associated Press report, Qingdao city and its suburbs have been shrouded in a large-scale conscription terror. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Qingdao city on the 11th and 12th of this month. It is said that this is the first time that Chiang's army has conscripted men in Qingdao city. Those arrested were crammed into pre-arranged trucks and transported to "detention" locations. When a woman tried to rescue her husband, she was brutally beaten by Chiang's soldiers. Among those arrested were clerks, students, workers, coolies, and even Chiang's police and constables. The Chiang's civil affairs agencies and the municipal government in the city were also forced to protest to Chiang's 11th Pacification Headquarters due to the threat of conscription. Currently, people in the city are panicking, and pedestrians are walking with trepidation. Conscription in the suburbs has become a regular phenomenon in recent months. On the 8th of this month, a group of Chiang's soldiers suddenly appeared in a market in the eastern suburbs, causing serious riots in various parts of the suburbs. Chiang's soldiers opened fire to prevent citizens from escaping, and another group of innocent people were arrested on the spot. According to the Associated Press, the Kuomintang army is frantically conscripting men because the number of soldiers in Chiang's army in Shandong has been reduced by more than one-third, and "serious shortages" have been found in various divisions of Chiang's army stationed in Jinan. At the same time, the discipline and morale of the Kuomintang army in Shandong have never been as corrupt and low as they are now, when the Shandong Communist Army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) is constantly winning victories. In addition to frantically conscripting men, Chiang's troops in the suburbs are also engaging in large-scale looting. According to Chiang's newspapers and periodicals, Chiang's bandits in Kaifeng, Tianjin, and Rehe are also extremely violent in conscripting men. In the area south of the Kaifeng Dam and north of the airport, Chiang's soldiers are grabbing men off the streets in groups of three or five. Whether they are farmers, vendors, merchants, or civil servants, they are arrested on sight. By the beginning of April, more than 400 farmers in the vicinity had been arrested and disappeared. A company commander of Chiang's army passing by was also arrested as a recruit. In Yangcun near Tianjin, Chiang's bandit army suddenly grabbed men from house to house on the night of April 18, and colluded with Chiang's township and village chiefs to demand people according to the register, and tied them up after they were caught. At that time, there was a chorus of crying, and the situation was extremely tragic. The families of the strong men in western Rehe who were brutally conscripted by Chiang's bandits protested to the Chiang's provincial government in Chengde in groups in mid-April. Zhang Yanshu's wife said angrily: "There are only two of us in the family. If he leaves, who will I rely on?" The old man Tian Guibao also took his old wife Tian Wangshi to the gate of Chiang's provincial government with a beggar's basket, demanding that his son be released home because his only son was arrested. When the citizens of Taiyuan recently changed their new household registration booklets, they tried to avoid being grouped together in order to evade Yan Xishan's military service.

　　青岛市内蒋匪抓丁
  　职员学生警宪亦被抓走
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据各方消息：蒋匪军在蒋区各地进行疯狂抓丁，正加剧蒋区社会的混乱。据美联社报导，青岛市内及市郊已为大规模的抓丁恐怖所笼罩。本月十一、十二两日青岛城内已有数百人被抓。据称：蒋军在青岛城内抓丁，此尚为首次。被抓者均被塞进预先布置的卡车，运到“拘禁”的地方去。当一位妇女在试图救出她的丈夫时，惨遭蒋军毒打。被抓去的人中，有职员、学生、工人和苦力，甚至蒋家警察宪兵亦有被抓走的。该市蒋记民政机关及市政府也因受抓丁威胁而被迫向蒋记第十一绥靖公署提出抗议。现市内人心惶惶，行人均提心吊胆，市郊抓丁月来已成经常现象。本月八日一批蒋军突然出现在东郊某市集，市郊各地顿时发生严重骚乱，蒋军并开枪阻止市民逃跑，当即又有一批无辜人民被抓。据美联社称：国民党军疯狂抓丁，是因为山东蒋军兵员减额已在三分之一以上，驻守济南蒋军各个师曾被发现有“严重缺额”。而与此同时，山东国民党军部队的纪律和士气从没有象现在山东共军（指人民解放军）不断获得胜利时这样败坏与低落。”市郊蒋军除疯狂抓丁外，且大事抢劫。另据蒋区报刊披露：开封、天津及热河等地蒋匪抓丁亦极狂暴。开封大堤以南机场以北地区，蒋军三五成群拦路抓丁。无论农民、小贩、商人、公务员，见人就抓。迄四月初，附近农民被抓失踪的已达四百余人。蒋军某部连长由此经过，亦被当作壮丁抓去。天津附近杨村，蒋匪军突于四月十八日深夜挨户抓丁，并会同蒋记乡保甲长按册索人，抓到后随即捆绑。当时一片哭声，情状极惨。热西惨遭蒋匪抓走的壮丁之家属，四月中成群结队向承德蒋记省府抗议。张彦树的妻子气愤地说：“一家就是我俩，他走了，我靠何人？”老翁田贵宝因独子被抓，亦偕老妻田王氏提着讨饭篮到蒋记省府门前，要求释放儿子回家。太原市民最近一次换新户口簿时，多设法避免编组，以逃避阎匪兵役。
