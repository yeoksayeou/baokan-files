　　Kunming Students Hold Demonstrations
  　Opposing US Support for Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS, Shanghai, 22nd, quoted the Shanghai Dagong Bao: Kunming students from various schools began patriotic demonstrations on the 21st against the US policy of supporting Japan. Because 30 students were arrested by the Kuomintang authorities after the demonstration, many school students have gone on strike in protest, and stated that they will not resume classes unless the arrested students are released.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. United Press, Nanjing, 20th. According to an actual investigation by its reporter among Nanjing merchants, it was revealed: "People generally believe that revengeful Japan will try to seize hegemony in the Pacific again," "Most merchants fear Japan's aggressive economic competition, believing that if China has to compete to the death again with cheap, counterfeit European and American Japanese exports, then it (referring to China) will surely suffer." "The general argument among merchants is: 'Trade with Japan should not be conducted before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan.'" The reporter reported: In a Hongtai Clothing Store on a major street in Nanjing, the 57-year-old boss felt that if trade with Japan were restored, "China's cotton and textile industry would be the first to become Japan's victim." A bookstore clerk said, "Japanese newspapers will exclude Chinese goods." Even Wang Wenshan (transliteration), the manager of the Hecheng Bank in the Department of Political Science, admitted: "A resurrected Tokyo will be comparable to Hitler's Third Reich," "The so-called 'making Japan self-sufficient' and giving Japan a 'police force' will tempt Japan to make a comeback."

　　昆明学生举行示威
  　反对美国扶植日本
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社上海二十二日电引沪大公报讯：昆明各校学生于二十一日开始举行反对美国扶日政策的爱国示威。由于示威后学生三十人被国民党当局逮捕，许多学校的学生已罢课抗议，并表示如不释放被捕同学决不复课。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】合众社南京二十日电根据该社记者在南京商人中间的实际调查披露：“人们普遍确信复仇心切的日本将会再度试图夺取太平洋的霸权”，“商人大半恐惧日本在经济上进行侵略性的竞争，相信假如中国必须再度与廉价的、假冒欧美出品的日本出口货拚个你死我活，则它（指中国）必将遭难”。“商人一般论调都说：‘在未签订对日和约前，不应该与日本进行贸易。’”该记者报导：南京一大街上宏泰成衣店，五十七岁的老板感到若与日本恢复贸易，则“中国的棉花与布匹工业，将会首先成为日本的牺牲品”。一书店的店员说：“日本的新闻纸将会排斥中国的商品”。甚至政学系的合城银行的经理王文山（译音）亦承认：“复活了的东京，将会同希特勒的第三帝国媲美”，“所谓使日本‘自食其力’和给日本以‘警察部队’，将会诱惑日本卷土重来”。
