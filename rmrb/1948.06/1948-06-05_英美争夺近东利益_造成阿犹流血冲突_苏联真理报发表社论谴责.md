Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd Telegraph: TASS Moscow News: Pravda published an editorial on the 29th of last month, condemning the policies of Britain and the United States that have caused bloody conflicts in Palestine. The editorial pointed out: Palestine has become a battlefield and a place of bloody struggle that endangers the interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples. One of the reasons for the armed conflict in Palestine is the attitude of Britain and the United States; the second reason is the policy pursued by the rulers of some Arab countries. This policy not only does not conform to the interests of the Arab people, but is also subordinate to the interests of foreign countries. It should not be forgotten that since the United Nations passed the resolution on the partition of Palestine, a stubborn struggle has been launched against the implementation of the resolution, led by the British delegation and supported by the American delegation. The latter has repeatedly changed its attitude. There is no doubt that if all the countries that voted in favor of the resolution on the partition of Palestine in the UN General Assembly in November 1947, especially the United States, had firmly abided by this resolution, the armed conflict we are currently seeing could have been avoided. Unfortunately, some countries, especially Britain, are now trying to use the United Nations not to establish peace in Palestine and promote cooperation between the Arab and Jewish peoples, but to obstruct it. The two-faced policy pursued by the American ruling class has also fueled the continuation of the conflict in Palestine. Their actions are supported on the one hand by oil monopolists who have huge interests in Arab countries, and on the other hand by the influence of electioneering groups. The editorial then elaborated on the Soviet Union's unwavering stance in the UN General Assembly to fight for the independent rights of the Arab and Jewish peoples of Palestine. The Soviet Union's recognition of the State of Israel is a manifestation of its adherence to the UN General Assembly resolution. The editorial finally emphasized: "The Soviet Union has defended and continues to defend the independence of Arab countries and the Arab nation, but it must be made very clear that the Arab countries' war against the new Jewish state is by no means for their national interests or independence, but is actually to cancel the right of the Jews to establish an independent state. The Arab countries thus taking up arms are preventing the legitimate right of the Palestinian Jewish people to establish an independent Jewish state. No matter how great the Soviet people's sympathy for the national liberation movement of the Arab people is, the Soviet people cannot but condemn the Arab countries' aggression against the State of Israel and its infringement on the right of the Jews to establish a state in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution.

### 英美争夺近东利益  造成阿犹流血冲突　苏联真理报发表社论谴责

　　英美争夺近东利益  造成阿犹流血冲突
  　苏联真理报发表社论谴责
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于上月二十九日发表社论，谴责英美的政策，造成了巴勒斯坦的流血冲突。社论指出：巴勒斯坦已经成为战场，已经成为危害阿拉伯与犹太两民旅利益的流血斗争场所。巴勒斯坦武装冲突的原因之一，就是英美的态度；第二个原因，是某些阿拉伯国家统治者所奉行的政策。这种政策，不但不符合于阿拉伯人民的利益，而且还臣属于外国的利益。不应该忘记，从联合国通过巴勒斯坦分治决定那时起，就发动了反对执行决议的顽固的斗争，这个斗争由英国代表团带头，得到美国代表团的支持。而后者曾一再变更态度。毫无疑议，如果一九四七年十一月在联大投票赞成巴勒斯坦分治决议的一切国家，首先是美国，都坚决遵守这个决议，则我们目前所看到的武装冲突，就有可能避免。不幸，目前某些国家，特别是英国，竭力利用联合国，不是为了建立巴勒斯坦的和平，使阿犹两民族合作，而是阻挠它。美国统治阶级亦奉行的两面政策，助长了巴勒斯坦冲突的绵延。他们的行动，一方面受到在阿拉伯各国有巨大利益的石油独占资本家的支持，另一方面又处在竞选集团的影响之下。社论继之阐述苏联在联合国大会上为巴勒斯坦阿犹两民族独立权利而奋斗不懈的立场。苏联之承认以色列国，就是信守联大决议的表现。社论最后着重指出：“苏联曾经辩护，而且仍在辩护阿拉伯国家和阿拉伯民族的独立，但是必须十分清楚的指明：阿拉伯国家进行反对新犹太国的战争，决不是为了他们的民族利益或独立，实际上是取消犹太人建立独立国家的权利。这样手执武器的阿拉伯各国，阻止了巴勒斯坦犹太民族成立犹太独立国的合法权利，不管苏联人民对阿拉伯人民民族解放运动的同情是多么大，苏联人民不能不谴责阿拉伯国家之侵略以色列国，及其侵犯犹太人遵照联大决议成立国家的权利。
