　　[News from Central Hebei] The masses in various parts of Central Hebei are organizing mutual aid to rush the wheat harvest. In Zhaicheng Village, Ding County, after discussions among the masses, more than 300 people voluntarily organized to rush the wheat harvest, and more than 100 people harvested more than 90 mu in one morning. The masses in the Second Street of Anguo City are helping each other to pull wheat, planning to finish the harvest in three days. Militiamen in Renqiu Jianglinhe, Yanglinhe, and other villages are not only protecting the masses during the wheat harvest, but also contracting to harvest wheat and voluntarily helping impoverished families of military personnel and revolutionary martyrs with harvesting. During the wheat harvest, care was given to families of military personnel and revolutionary martyrs and families of front-line laborers who lacked labor; in the Second Village of Anguo City, led by cadres and party members, the masses helped military families with harvesting and threshing, and more than 70 mu have been harvested in three days. The Communist Youth League of Wujiazhuang Village, Ding County, helped military families and front-line laborers harvest more than 10 mu of wheat. Women in various places participated in the wheat harvest with great enthusiasm. Women in Xiahe Hanzhuang, led by women's representative Jiao Yu, 50 women voluntarily formed four groups to cut wheat for military families, and the first group cut nine mu in half a day. In Renqiu Jianglinhe Village, He Xiuyun and six other women cooperated and helped each other, harvesting 37 mu of wheat in three days, an average of more than two mu per person per day. At the same time, various agencies and troops actively helped the masses with the wheat harvest. The Political Department of the Military Region stipulated that each agency and troop should help the masses for four workdays. Units directly under the Military Region and units directly under the District Party Committee all sent people every day to help with the wheat harvest; 45 cadres from the Renqiu agencies organized two wheat harvesting teams to help villages where they were stationed with pulling wheat, planning to harvest more than 60 mu of wheat for more than 20 families of military personnel and impoverished farmers lacking labor in the villages where they were stationed within three days. The masses in the border areas actively rushed to harvest under the cover of our armed forces. In the Dafu Village, Xiaofu Village, and Shiqiao Villages in the Qingyuan border area (about ten miles south of Baoding), the militia cooperated with local armed forces on the 10th to fiercely attack the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 32nd Division (missing two battalions) and a regiment of the puppet army Yang Defan's troops who attempted to seize wheat, killing and wounding 130 enemies and forcing the enemies to flee back to Baoding in disgrace. During this battle, the local masses still seized the time to continue rushing to harvest when the artillery fire was sparse. The Armed Work Team and militia in a certain border area carried out joint defense operations to combat the enemy, successively repelling several intrusions by bandits and puppets to seize wheat.

　　[News from Taiyue] Xiyaotou Village, Jiyuan Third District, helped each other with the summer harvest. In six days, all the wheat in the village was cut and threshed. Difficulties arose during the discussion of the summer harvest on May 26. Families of participating laborers and military cadres were worried about losing their wheat because the men were away from home. In addition, those with labor were unwilling to help each other, fearing that they would lose their own wheat by cutting others' wheat. Comrade Guo Jiaou, the village instructor, held a meeting with the heads of the neighborhood, mutual aid groups, and peasant association groups to discuss and solve these problems, and decided on the following measures: 1. Cadres must personally participate in mutual aid to play a leading role and strengthen leadership. 2. Mobilize family members of participants in the war, military cadres, women, and children to participate in mutual aid, calculate the number of mu each household should cut, and allocate work points for those who have no way to help. When semi-able-bodied laborers cut wheat, they are divided according to the work done, and those who can keep up with the fully able-bodied are given ten points for their work, and they are rewarded for their hard work. In this way, in addition to the original seven groups, 17 more groups were voluntarily formed. Of the 224 households in the village, 199 households participated in mutual aid, and 253 men and women full laborers (calculated by converting semi-able-bodied laborers) were organized to rush the wheat harvest. In six days, all the wheat was cut and threshed. Each workday averaged 1.3 mu of wheat cut, saving 1,916 workdays compared to not having mutual aid.
