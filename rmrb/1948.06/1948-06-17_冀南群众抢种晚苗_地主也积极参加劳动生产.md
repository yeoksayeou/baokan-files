　　Jinnan News: After a thorough rain on June 7th in the Jinnan District, the masses in some villages in Yuanchao, Weixian County, seized the opportunity to rush to plant late seedlings. The masses in Xuguzhai, the second district of Weixian County, were all smiles, discussing that this was a harbinger of a bumper harvest. Mu Laoduo, a 65-year-old farmer, said, "From the 24th year of Guangxu to now, it has been 50 years, and this is the first time such a rain has occurred. That year was a bumper harvest. With such good soil moisture, as long as everyone works in a timely manner, it will surely be a year of plenty." People said, "If it weren't for this rain, the cotton would have been killed by aphids." More than ten households, including Nian Honglai, who had cleared their wheat fields early, rushed to plant the day after the rain. In order to lead the masses to seize the opportunity to rush to plant late seedlings, the work team invited experienced old farmers on the evening of the 8th to hold a production forum to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power shortage in harvesting, threshing, and planting. At the meeting, Xu Zhenfa proposed: manpower, livestock, and farm tools should all be used in a coordinated manner. In the morning, livestock should be used for planting, women should be at home drying wheat in the morning, and men should be cutting wheat or hoeing in the afternoon, and threshing in the afternoon. He also said: If everyone takes care of their own business, the work will not get done. Several people working together will produce more. Those with more land and fewer people can work together with those with more people and less land through exchange labor, so that all the land can be planted and the wheat can be brought home. Zhang Fangda, a middle peasant, said: One animal can plant ten mu of land in half a day, and the whole village can finish planting in six or seven days. Now there is still wheat growing in the fields, so we can harvest wheat, clear the land, and plant at the same time. After the forum introduced experiences, everyone's production enthusiasm was very high. After the meeting, some delivered manure, some plowed the land, and Zhang Lao Jian, Zhang Tianzheng and other households who harvested wheat and cleared the land early had already started planting. After the land was classified according to class, the landlords understood that the Communist Party's policy was to reward labor, and they also became active. Zhang Lao Xiao, a landlord who had never worked in the fields before, went to hoe the fields the second morning after the weather cleared. The masses in Wang Gaozhai were also very enthusiastic about production. Wang Qingkui's group, Lao Ying, got up early and carried six loads of manure to the fields, and planted two mu of late millet. The group planted six mu in half a day on the afternoon of the 8th. Qingkui planned to finish planting the wheat stubble on the 9th. Lao Hui originally wanted to dry a few mu of wheat for retention, but after this rain, he wanted to plant all autumn seedlings. In order to solve the contradictions in the masses' lives, such as harvesting wheat, threshing, hoeing seedlings, and planting, as well as the difficulties of shortage of manpower and livestock, the work team in this village also held a forum for farmers with production experience. The result of the discussion was that the only way was to mobilize all men, women, full and semi-labor forces to work together, help each other, and regulate livestock and farm tools. After class classification in Matangzhai, the past wrong classifications were corrected, and the middle and poor peasants were very at ease, working day and night. Li Laojun, who was wrongly classified as a rich peasant in the past, was reclassified as a middle peasant, and often ran more than thirty miles to sell vegetables. This thorough rain added to his energy. Before people got up after the rain stopped, he went to Fangying Market to buy soybean seeds, and planted two mu of land after he came back. The masses in Yuanchao Qianxian Village are also working together to harvest wheat, thresh, hoe seedlings, and plant. A mood of unity and production among all classes has begun to emerge in the countryside.

　　冀南群众抢种晚苗
  　地主也积极参加劳动生产
    【冀南讯】冀南区六月七日落了透雨，威县元朝有些村庄，群众抓紧时机抢种晚苗。威县二区徐固寨群众眉开眼笑，纷纷议论这是一个丰收的预兆。六十五岁的老农穆老铎说：“从光绪二十四年到现在已五十年了，这雨还是第一次。那年丰收了一年。这样的好墒，只要大家干活应时，准是丰年。”人们说：“要不是这场雨，棉花就要被蜜虫（即蚜虫）蜜死了。”年洪来等十余户麦地誊的早，雨后第二天就抢种起来。工作组为了领导群众，抓紧时机抢种晚苗，于八日晚邀请生产有经验的老农民，召开生产座谈会，解决收麦、场、播种中人力畜力缺乏的困难。在会上徐振法提出：人力、牲口、农具都调开使用，早晨牲口耩地，上午妇女在家晒麦子，男人割麦或锄地，下午打场。他又说：各顾各，活就作不过来。几个人在一起多出活。地多人少的可和人多地少的夥干换工，地都能耩上，麦子也能收到家里。中农张防达说：一个牲口一晌能耩十来亩地，全村六七天就可耩完。现在地里还长着麦子，可一边割麦誊地，一边耩。经过座谈介绍经验后，大家生产情绪都很高，会后有的送粪，有的犁地，收麦誊地早的张老鉴、张天正等户，已开始耩地了。地主经过划阶级后，了解共产党的政策是奖励劳动，也积极起来了。从来没有下过地的地主张老笑，天晴的第二天早上就去锄地。王高寨群众生产也很带劲，王庆奎组老营起早往地里挑了六担粪，耩了二亩晚谷，该组八日下午一晌种了六亩。庆奎准备九日把麦茬也耩完。老辉原先想晒几亩留麦，有这场雨，他又想都种上秋苗。这村工作组为解决群众收麦、打场、锄苗、下种等生活的矛盾和人畜力缺乏的困难，也召开了一个有生产经验的农民座谈会，讨论的结果，唯一的办法是动员男女全半劳力一齐下手，合伙互助，调剂牲口农具。马塘寨划阶级后，纠正了过去错订成份，中贫农都很安心，昼夜不停的干活。过去错订为富农的李老钧改订为中农后，常常跑到三十里以外去卖菜。这次下了透雨，更给他添了劲。雨停后人们都还没起，他就去方营集上买黄豆种，回来就耩了二亩地。元朝前现城村群众也正合伙互助收麦、打场、锄苗、下种。农村中开始呈现出各阶层团结生产的情绪。
