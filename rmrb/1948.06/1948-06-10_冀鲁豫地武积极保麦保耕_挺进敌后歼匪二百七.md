　　Jilu Yu Local Armed Forces Actively Protect Wheat and Farming
  　Advance Behind Enemy Lines to Eliminate 270 Bandits
    [Jilu Yu, 3rd dispatch] To protect the masses' wheat harvest and summer farming, our Seventh Military Sub-district's local armed forces actively advanced behind enemy lines to strike at Chiang bandit troops. From April 10th to May 10th, in the course of a month, six battles were conducted, eliminating a total of 274 Chiang bandit local tyrants and bandits, including 222 captured, 52 killed or wounded. The army seized seven light machine guns, three grenade launchers, 163 rifles and pistols, four carts, and five warhorses. At the same time, as a result of our implementation of the Central Committee's policies in various regions, the impact of resettling landlords and rich peasants has caused the collapse of most of the local bandits in the Ji and Wen areas. A second lieutenant platoon leader captured in the Xu Village battle in southeast Wen said: "Our battalion used to be the strongest in combat effectiveness. Since fighting with you, you have quickly released those captured, and great changes have taken place within us. Therefore, last night we didn't resist and were willing to quickly surrender our guns and go home." The First Battalion of the Shandong Second District Self-Defense Regiment, totaling 249 people, had 69 killed or captured by us, with the majority running home. Very few gathered together afterward. Of the more than 30 former personnel of the puppet organization in Yuankou, more than 20 have now returned home. Besides consolidating the Yun-Wen two-river line, we have also opened up new areas. Recently, our local armed forces have been continuously active in eastern Wen and northern Ji, and often active in places two or three li away from Wenshang city. The enemy has been compressed into the city and dare not come out. Other remaining local bandits sleep in wheat fields at night, very afraid of being eliminated by our army.

　　冀鲁豫地武积极保麦保耕
  　挺进敌后歼匪二百七
    【冀鲁豫三日电】我七分区地方武装，为保卫群众麦收夏耕，积极挺进敌后，打击蒋匪军，从四月十号到五月十号一个月中，进行了六次战斗，共消灭蒋匪土顽二百七十四名，内俘二百二十二名，毙伤五十二名，缴获轻机枪七挺，掷弹筒三个，长短枪一百六十三支，车子四辆，战马五匹。同时，由于我各地执行中央政策的结果，安置地富的影响，使济、汶地区的土杂顽匪，大部分垮台。汶东南徐村战斗被俘的少尉排长说：我们营过去战斗力最强，从跟你们打了仗以后，你们把所俘的人很快的放回去，我们内部起了很大的变化，所以昨天晚上都不抵抗，愿意快缴枪快回家。山东二区自卫团一营，共二百四十九人，除被我们毙俘六十九名外，大部分跑回家去了，以后集合起来的很少。袁口过去伪组织人员三十余名，现已回家的二十余名。除这样不但巩固了运汶两河一线外，又开辟了新的地区。最近我地方武装不断的活动到汶东、济北，并常活动到离汶上城二三里的地方，敌人被压缩到城内，不敢出来。其他残余的地杂顽，他们夜间睡到麦地里，非常害怕被我军消灭。
