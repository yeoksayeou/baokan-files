　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 17th: Delayed news: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the local Chiang bandit Yu-Xi Second Guerrilla General Headquarters near Niutijie, 90 li west of Zhumadian, on May 30th. The enemy's Lieutenant General Commander Yun Qichang, Colonel Detachment Leaders Wang Qinrui, Song Lanting, Colonel Regiment Commander of the Special Second Regiment Wang Weichao, Major Battalion Commander Wei Daocheng, Major Quartermaster Wang Pu, and 24 lieutenant officers and more than 50 soldiers were captured alive. More than ten people, including the Colonel Detachment Leader, were killed. A radio station and other military supplies were seized. It is reported that Yun Qichang was originally the Brigade Commander of the 124th Brigade of Han Fuju's 81st Division, and later surrendered to Hu Zongnan, serving as the Deputy Division Commander of the 41st Division, and Commissioner of Henan Province. This unit was established last spring, named the Yu-Xi Second Guerrilla General Headquarters, directly under Hu Zongnan. The General Headquarters had a total of five special service regiments and ten detachments. Each regiment had more officers and fewer soldiers, generally only dozens of people, and more than 40 long and short guns. After Zhumadian, where the bandit General Headquarters was located, was liberated by us, the soldiers fled, leaving only Yun himself and more than one hundred remnants wandering in the mountains west of Suiping and Zhumadian, hiding during the day and coming out at night to rob the people of their property. The local people were overjoyed when they were completely annihilated this time.
