Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 13th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, during the intervals of fighting against Chiang Kai-shek's 18th Army on the south bank of the Sha River between Yancheng and Xiping on the Pinghan Railway, actively helped local farmers harvest wheat. The commander, political commissar, and director of the political department of a certain column personally led the headquarters personnel to cut 74 mu of wheat in one day. The "Victory Company" guarding the front line put forward the slogan "Two Cuts, Two Falls," meaning "Holding a sickle to help farmers cut down the wheat, holding a bayonet to stab down the attacking enemy." On the morning of the 2nd, when the enemy's artillery fire subsided slightly, the entire company, except for a few sentries on guard, took out the sickles they had borrowed in advance from the fortifications and helped farmers harvest in the wheat fields near the position. The soldiers on the second and third lines were also both armed and on guard while helping with the harvest. All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit's forward command post worked together to cut quickly and well, and helped the farmers carry the wheat to the threshing ground, earning endless praise from the farmers. A blind old woman in Weizhuang was moved to tears and said, "The sound of the cannons suggests the enemy is running far away. Quickly drive back the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, and comrades, stay here and eat new noodles together." The rear of a certain unit in Shanwangmiao Village helped support the farmers on the front line by harvesting in exchange for labor. They mobilized two stretchers and a large cart in the village and helped ten families harvest 25 mu of wheat in one afternoon. The civilians were very happy and said, "Even if we were at home, we couldn't harvest this quickly. Comrades are fighting for the people, truly an army of the farmers." They then went to the front line with peace of mind.

　　中原我军在郾城前线
  　利用战斗间隙帮助农民收麦
    【新华社中原前线十三日电】解放军某部，在平汉线郾城、西平间沙河南岸阻击蒋匪十八军的战斗间隙中，积极帮助当地农民麦收。某纵队司令员、政委、政治部主任亲率指挥部人员一天内割麦子七十四亩，守卫在第一线上的“得胜连”，他们提出“两刀两倒”的口号，即“手拿镰刀帮农民把麦子割倒，手持刺刀把进攻的敌人刺倒”。二日晨，敌人的炮击稍稀，全连除派出少数的观察哨兵警戒外，战士们纷纷从工事里拿出预先借的镰刀，在阵地附近麦地里帮助农民收割。其在第二及第三线上的战士们，同样也是一面武装警戒，一面帮助抢收，某部前方指挥所全体指战员一齐动手割的又好又快，并帮助农民背上场，农民称赞不绝。魏庄一个瞎老妈感动得流泪说：“听炮声敌人象是跑远了，快把贼中央打退，同志们都留在这里一块吃新面吧。”某部后方在山王庙村以换工方式帮助支援前线的农民收割，他们在该村动员了两付担架一辆大车，在一个下午即帮助十一家民工割麦二十五亩，民工很高兴的说：“＠在家也不能割得这样快，同志们打仗为了人民，真是庄稼人的队伍”，于是很安心的赶赴前线。
