Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. According to Agence France-Presse: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué on the 10th, fiercely criticizing the decisions of the London Six-Power Conference. The communiqué stated: The decision stipulates that American imperialism will completely rule West Germany, restore the Ruhr industry, and establish a reactionary militarist West German government. West Germany will become a stronghold against the Soviet Union, against the new democratic countries, and against all democratic movements in European countries. The decision makes French industry dependent on the Ruhr's huge metal and chemical industries, which are managed by Krupp and other Hitler accomplices under the absolute control of American tycoons. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party called on all workers and democratic forces to unite against this decision, and instructed the Communist Party members of Congress to vote against it.

  　反对伦敦六国会议决定
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据法新社消息：法共政治局于十日发表公报，猛烈抨击伦敦六国会议的决定。公报称：该决定规定美帝国主义全部统治西德，恢复鲁尔工业与成立反动的军国主义的西德政府，西德将成为反苏、反新民主主义各国以及反对所有欧洲各国民主运动的据点。该决定使法国工业仰赖于鲁尔的巨大金属及化学工业，而这些工业是在美国富豪的绝对控制下由克鲁伯与其他希特勒同谋者所掌管。法共政治局号召所有的工人与民主力量为反对这一决定而团结起来，并授命共产党国会议员，投票反对这一决定。
