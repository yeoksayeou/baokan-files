　　Lingshou Launches "Love the Newspaper" Campaign
  　Strengthening Communication and Reporting

    [Northern News] Lingshou is launching a campaign to cherish the Party newspaper. In the past six months, the county's communication and reporting work has suffered from serious spontaneity, with very few submissions and low quality. Many Party members and cadres do not pay enough attention to the Party newspaper and do not study it seriously. The distribution of the Party newspaper is also very poor, with newspapers sometimes being lost. In some villages, a few people even control the newspapers, preventing the broad masses from seeing or hearing them, which greatly reduces the Party newspaper's propaganda and guiding role. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and strengthen communication and reporting work, the Lingshou County Committee has decided to launch a "Love the Newspaper" campaign throughout the county. The main content and specific implementation methods are: First, in conjunction with the cadre expansion meeting in June, implement the Party's policy of running newspapers by the whole Party, carry out study and mobilization, unify the thinking of cadres, and earnestly achieve "Read the newspaper to do work, do the work and write the communications." Second, in June, re-develop correspondents, rectify and establish communication organizations. The County Committee will designate a group of backbone correspondents, issue letters of appointment in the name of the County Committee, and each backbone correspondent will perform three tasks: (1) Regard communication and reporting work as one of their important tasks, and write at least two articles per month. (2) Actively participate in communication group activities, be responsible for introducing correspondents, helping to establish communication organizations, and helping comrades write articles. (3) Promptly reflect the masses' opinions on the Party newspaper's communications, arrangement, distribution, printing, and other aspects. Third, strengthen the Party newspaper study of cadres in service. Fourth, strengthen the distribution of Party newspapers, check and improve township delivery work. (Zuo Run)

　　灵寿开展爱报运动
  　加强通讯报导工作
    【北方讯】灵寿开展爱护党报运动。该县半年来之通讯报导工作，存在着严重的自流现象，稿件极少质量又低。许多党员干部对党报不重视，没有认真学习党报。党报的发行工作亦很差，有时发生丢报现象，甚至有的村少数人把持报纸，广大群众看不上听不到，大大降低了党报的宣传指导作用。灵寿县委为了克服上述缺点加强通讯报导工作，特决定在全县开展爱护党报运动。其主要内容与具体进行办法是：一，结合六月扩干会，贯彻全党办报方针，进行学习动员，搞通干部思想，认真作到“看了报纸作工作，作了工作写通讯”。二，六月份进行重新发展通讯员，整顿与建立通讯组织。县委指定一批骨干通讯员，以县委名誉发给聘请书，每个骨干通讯员履行三个任务：（一）把通讯报导工作当成自己的重要工作之一，每月至少写稿两篇。（二）积极参加通讯小组活动，负责介绍通讯员，帮助建立通讯组织，帮助同志们写稿。（三）及时反映群众对党报通讯、编排、发行、印刷等方面的意见。三，加强在职干部的党报学习。四，加强党报的发行工作，检查与改进乡交工作。（左润）
