　　[Chahar News] After the peasants of villages under the Laizhuo West River turned over to become landowners, the West River Water Association was reorganized, eliminating years of accumulated malpractices, and increasing irrigated land by 13,000 mu. This water association was established in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), and had always been controlled by upper-class elements. Internal feudal bad habits and customs, as well as corruption and bribery, were even more serious. The masses from each group contributed a lot of manpower and resources every year, but the amount of land irrigated was very limited. For example, the Dirang ditch jointly opened by the three villages of Sun Village, Zhao Ge Village, and Guan Ge Village could have irrigated 190 qing of land, but in reality, only 9,500 mu could be irrigated. Deng Yingchen, director of the Farmers' Association, spent more than 70 border currency dollars (not including food at home) on one trip in April of last spring, and entertained guests with over one million dollars, which caused great dissatisfaction among the local masses. During the land reform, they reasoned and argued against the dark rule of the Water Association, and reorganized the Water Association in August. The 26 villages under the West River elected directors, deputy directors, and committee members to manage and resolve water usage issues in the canals; and through democratic consultation, the wage system for Water Association personnel in the past was abolished and replaced with a voluntary system; the "water selling" phenomenon of blockade and extortion and other accumulated malpractices were stopped. The water supply method was improved, 37 new water gates were built, and sluice gates were installed at all distribution canal outlets, saving 1,312 workdays for land irrigation throughout the year; a water allocation system was implemented, dividing the entire river into two sections, green irrigation (i.e., irrigating whatever needs irrigating), which saves water and reduces disputes; due to the above improvements, the current irrigated area has increased by more than 13,100 mu.

　　涞涿改组西河水会
  　增加水田万三千亩
    【嚓哈尔讯】涞涿西河所属各村翻身种地，这组西河水会，消灭多年积弊，增加水达一万三千亩。该水会成立于民国三十五年，一直被上层分子把持，内部封建恶习风俗，贪污腐化贿赂更为严重。一组群众每年出了许多人力物力，但浇地却很有限。如孙庄、赵各庄、关各庄三村合开的地壤沟，本可浇地一百九十顷，实际能浇上水的却只九千五百亩。农会主任邓颖臣去春四月出门一次就花了边币七十多元（在家吃的不算），招待客人一百多万，当地群众极为不满。土改中向水会的黑暗统治展开说理力争，并于八月间改组了水会，由西河所属二十六村在主选出正副主任及委员，管理和解决渠道的使水诸问题；并经民主商计取消了过去年水会人员的工钱制度，改成了义务制；停止了封锁勒索的“卖水”现象及其他积弊。改良了供水办法，新修水闸三十七个，分水口沟一律设闸，全年浇地可省工一千三百一十二个；实行了推水制，把全河分成两段，绿色推浇（即浇什么都浇什么），既节省水，又可减少纠纷；由于以上种种改进，现浇地面积已增加一万三千一百多亩。
