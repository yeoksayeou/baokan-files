Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Su, Lu, Yu and Anhui, 15th. A certain corps of the East China People's Liberation Army, during its training period, encountered a severe spring famine in its stationed area. The unit immediately launched a saving-grain-for-disaster-relief campaign and helped and promoted mass self-salvation through production. Consequently, the masses in several stationed villages overcame the spring famine.

　　A certain unit helped the masses deliver more than 11,000 cartloads of manure, push more than 5,600 cartloads of earth, push the mill more than 22,700 times, cultivate more than 2,700 mu of land, and assist in labor for 580 people. During the saving campaign, many commanders and fighters donated their meager allowances. A certain company donated 35,600 Jicha coins (each coin equals approximately 100 Chiang coins), 650 catties of millet, and 95 pieces of clothing, benefiting 85 disaster-stricken families, with 265 people receiving assistance. A certain artillery company switched to eating two meals of thin porridge a day, saving 580 catties of millet. A certain hospital, seeing that the masses had no food, immediately switched to eating several meals of thin porridge, saving 1,990 catties of corn, which was distributed to 49 disaster-stricken families. According to incomplete statistics from a certain unit, a total of nearly 100,000 catties of grain, 1.2 million Jicha coins, and 853 pieces of clothing were donated.

　　To understand the pain of the impoverished masses in thought and emotion, the entire 8th and 9th companies of a certain unit voluntarily ate a meal of elm leaves and allocated time from their training to engage in productive labor for the masses. The special service battalion of a certain unit helped the masses carry more than 1,700 loads of water in five days and also helped the masses sweep courtyards, sweep streets, push manure, weed, chop firewood, and collect manure. Some companies also helped the masses scrape saline soil to extract salt, allowing the masses to free up labor to engage in small businesses. The hospital provided free medical treatment and vaccination to the masses.

　　At a mass rally for disaster relief, a farmer named Guo Junyun said gratefully: "I have run out of food several times. This time, you gave me eight pieces of clothing and two thousand coins, so my family and I won't starve to death. The troops are reluctant to eat and wear, saving for us. I will never forget this army in my life." The masses gave the troops a flag of "Glorious Model" and said, "We have nothing to repay you with. Take this flag with you wherever you go." Many women in the stationed villages voluntarily organized themselves to sew and mend clothes for the soldiers in their spare time, and the relationship between the army and the people was very harmonious.

    部队节粮十万斤救灾
  　帮助推动群众生产自救
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十五日电】华东人民解放军某兵团，在整训期间正遇到驻地春荒严重，该部即进行节约救灾运动，并帮助与推动群众生产自救，若干驻村群众因此渡过春荒。某部曾帮助群众送粪一万一千余车，推土五千六百余车，推磨二万二千七百余次，耕地二千七百余亩，帮工五百八十个。节约运动中，许多指战员都捐出了自己仅有的津贴，某部一个连捐冀钞三万五千六百元，（每元合蒋币约百元）小米六百五十斤，衣服九十五件，分给八十五家灾户，二百六十五人得到帮助。某炮兵连改吃两餐稀饭，节约小米五百八十斤。某医院见到群众没饭吃，马上改吃若干顿稀饭节约下玉米一千九百九十斤，分给四十九家灾户。据某部不完全统计，共捐粮近十万斤，冀钞一百二十万元，衣服八百五十三件。为在思想与感情上体会贫苦群众痛苦，某部八、九两连全体自动吃了一顿榆树叶，并抽出整训时间，为群众生产劳动。某部特务营五天内即帮助群众挑水一千七百余担，还帮助群众扫院、扫街、推粪锄草、劈柴拾粪等劳动。某些连队还帮助群众刮盐土淋盐，使群众腾出劳动力去做小买卖。医院替群众免费诊治种牛痘。在一次救灾的群众大会上，农民郭俊云感激地说：“我断顿（断炊）了好几次，这下给了我八件衣服，两千块钱，我和我的家人就饿不死了，队伍上不舍吃不舍穿省给咱，我一辈子也忘不了这队伍”。群众给部队送了一面“光荣模范”的旗子，并说：“我们无可报答，这面旗同志们走到那里带到那里吧”。许多驻村妇女自动组织起来，利用空闲给战士们缝补衣服，军民关系非常融洽。
