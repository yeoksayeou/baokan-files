　　    The news about arbitrarily sealing household registrations was not in the Sixth District but in the Third District
　　    To the editors:
　　    I read in your newspaper on April 24th the news about unsealing household registrations that were arbitrarily sealed in Pingshun's Sixth District. It was not the Sixth District but the Third District. I don't know if I wrote it wrong or if you read it wrong.
　　    The sealing of households was approved by the county for one household, and by the district leadership for three households, totaling four households in the entire district. The main reasons were selling buried items, dispersing grain, burning farm tools for firewood, and extravagant eating and drinking. The sealing was done after several discussions (the sealed households were all those who initially divided the village).
　　    Regarding the issue of livestock and pigs, I had such wrong thinking at the time, but it did not become a reality (the village turned to production halfway through the division). My biggest mistake was not asking the leadership how to handle it; we only discussed it among ourselves, and each village had such problems.
　　    Regarding the unsealing issue, it has been decided at this village chiefs' meeting to resolutely implement the Central Bureau's instructions to unseal. Because I work in the countryside, I couldn't read the newspaper earlier, so I couldn't write sooner.　　　　　　　　(Yue Peizhong)

　　岳培忠同志来信说：
    随便查封户口消息不是六区而是三区
    编者同志：
    我看了贵报四月二十四日平顺六区随便查封的户口应启封消息，不是六区是三区的事情，不知是我写错也不知你们看错了。
    查封情况是由县批准的一户，区领导上批准三户，全区四户。主要是因为出卖埋藏东西，分散粮食，农具烧了柴，大吃大喝。经过几次研究查封的（查封的户均是开始平分村子）。
    牲口与猪问题，是我当时有那样错误思想，并没有形成事实（平分半路又转向生产的村）。我最大的错误没有问过领导上怎样办，只是我们几个人在一块谈，各村有这样的问题。
    启封问题，在这次村长会议上已规定回去坚决执行中央局指示启封，因我在乡村工作，不能早看报，所以也早去不了信。　　　　　　　　（岳培忠）
