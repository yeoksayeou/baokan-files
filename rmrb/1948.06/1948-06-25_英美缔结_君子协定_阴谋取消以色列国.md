Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 23rd. According to a TASS report from Prague on the 16th, citing news agency dispatches from Prague: In order to facilitate their joint enslavement of Palestine and the oil-producing countries of the Middle East, the United States and Britain have concluded a "Gentleman's Agreement" (Note: meaning an oral agreement with significant legal effect). It stipulates that in future Palestinian peace negotiations, both countries will jointly support resolving the Palestinian issue through a "federal" approach. The so-called "federal" approach is, in reality, to cancel the independence of the State of Israel. According to Agence France-Presse, Count Folke Bernadotte, the "mediator" sent by the Security Council, has a "federal" plan. He advocates placing the governing power of Palestine under the unified leadership of the Arab League or an Arab country, with the State of Israel only having the status of an autonomous region. To this end, the United States is putting pressure on the Zionist leaders of the State of Israel to force them to accept it. On the other hand, Britain is urging King Abdullah of Transjordan to agree to this plan. The British government has already instructed Clayton, the head of the British Information Office in the Near East, to make preparations, telling him to incite the Arab League countries (Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen) to approve this plan in the future. In addition, the United States and Britain have agreed that "any solution to the Palestinian issue will be carried out directly by both parties, avoiding new demands on the United Nations." (Note: The purpose of this approach is to avoid countries like the Soviet Union, which are competing for influence in the UN regarding the UN's partition resolution of Palestine, from obstructing the implementation of Anglo-American imperialist policies in the United Nations.)

　　英美缔结“君子协定”
  　阴谋取消以色列国
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据塔斯社布拉格十六日引证布拉格的电报通讯社消息说：美英两国为了便于共同奴役巴勒斯坦及中东产油国，缔结了一个“君子协定”（按：即具有重式法律效能的口头协定）。其中规定：两国在将来巴勒斯坦和平谈判中，共同支持用“联邦”办法解决巴勒斯坦问题。所谓“联邦”办法，实际上就是取消以色列国的独立。据法新社称：安里会所派的“调停”苏拉伯纳杜特有一个“联邦”方案，他主张，是将巴勒斯坦国的政权，放在阿剌伯联盟或一个阿剌伯国家统一领导之下，以色列国仅属于一个自治邦的地位。为此目的，一方面由美国对以色列国的犹太复国主义者的领袖们施以压力，迫其接受；另一方面，由英国促使外约旦国王阿布杜拉同意这一方案。英政府并已训令英国驻近东情报处长克莱登进行准备，叫他去唆使阿剌伯联盟各国（埃及、外约旦、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿剌伯、也门）将来批准这个方案。此外，美英并约定：“巴勒斯坦问题的任何解决办法，将由双方直接进行，避免对联合国提出新要求”。（按：这种办法的用意，是想避免苏联等争夺联合国阿犹分治决之定的国家在联合国中阻止英美帝国主义政策的实现。）
