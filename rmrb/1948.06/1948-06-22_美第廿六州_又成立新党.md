　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. According to a TASS dispatch from the 12th, the Progressive Party of Kentucky in the United States has recently been established and has submitted to the state authorities a candidate list with 5,000 signatures, nominating Wallace and Taylor as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates, requesting that they be placed on the candidate list. So far, new party committees have been established in 26 of the 48 states in the United States. According to the agency's dispatch from the 14th, after Wallace convened a meeting for his presidential campaign, he recently issued notices to hundreds of national organizations, including labor unions, blacks, women, youth, and farmers, soliciting their opinions on the new party's platform. The notice stated: Opinions from all organizations that truly represent the interests of the people are welcome. Before the new party's national conference is held, various public meetings will be held to hear opinions on the party platform. Field, the leader of the youth department of Wallace's national presidential campaign committee, announced that the department has scheduled a national conference of youth organizations to be held in Philadelphia on July 25th and 26th to fully support Wallace's platform. It is expected that 1,500 youth representatives will attend the conference. Furthermore, reactionary parties in the U.S. states of Ohio and Oklahoma have unreasonably rejected the third party's unreasonable demands in those two states.
