When we launched the attack, the artillery fire shook the urban area of Changchun, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops defending the city were extremely panicked. Li Hong, commander of the enemy's New 7th Army, once led the New 38th Division to support, but was beaten back as soon as they left the urban area.

Among them, Liu Liwu, deputy commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 61st Provisional Division, was killed, and Xia Yunhong and Chang Naifei, deputy commanders of the Security Brigade, and 2,174 others were wounded. We captured alive × Zheng Guo, deputy commander of the 56th Division, Hao Kexing, commander of the 1st Regiment of the 56th Provisional Division, Xu Youda, deputy commander, Cao Jianzhong, commander of the 2nd Regiment, Zhao Tingxiang, deputy commander, Duan Guoxing, director of the Political Work Office of the 61st Provisional Division, and Zou Shujie, the puppet Changchun County magistrate, and 3,829 others. In addition, 71 people defected on the front lines. We seized nine mortars, forty-four 60mm guns, eight grenade launchers, forty-six heavy machine guns, one hundred and ninety-three light machine guns, one hundred and seventy-nine submachine guns, two thousand five hundred and eighty-four rifles and carbines, twenty-four pistols, three hundred and one thousand four hundred and forty-six rounds of various bullets, one thousand five hundred and twenty-eight rounds of artillery shells, one thousand two hundred and three hand grenades, three hundred and eleven bayonets, one radio station, six telephone switchboards, twenty-two single phones, five cars, twenty-nine carts, and one hundred and eighty mules and horses.
