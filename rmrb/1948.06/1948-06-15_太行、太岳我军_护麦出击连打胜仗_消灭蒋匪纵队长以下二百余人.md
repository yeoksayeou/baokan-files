In the area near Jiaozuo to Xiuwu, they captured one enemy stronghold, raided two enemy strongholds, destroyed fifteen bunkers, and annihilated a portion of the 1st Regiment of the 6th Security Brigade of Henan and local Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Xiuwu and other places, killing, wounding, and capturing 162 enemies, seizing one mortar, three light machine guns, and fifty-three rifles and carbines. At the same time, our local armed forces advanced into the Xiu (wu)-Huo (jia)-Wu (zhi) triangle area to carry out political offensives, and the enemy guarding Erpuying fled upon hearing the news. On May 23rd, a portion of the enemy's 3rd Security Brigade of Henan Province, stationed in Huaicun Camp, Xinxiang, numbering about 500, attacked the area around Qianhou Fancheng, and was ambushed by the local armed forces of Huixian, killing and wounding 14 enemies, including a company commander, and capturing 5. The remaining enemies fled. Furthermore, units from the Taihang and Jiluyu Military Regions along the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, in coordination with the local armed forces of Tangyin, jointly swept away local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the area southwest of Xunxian, south of Tangyin, in late May.
