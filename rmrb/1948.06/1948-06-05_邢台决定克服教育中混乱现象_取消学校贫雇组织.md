　　【Xingtai News】The Xingtai County Education Section convened fourteen people, including complete primary school principals and joint principals, on the 23rd of this month to discuss current education work. For the past six months, the overall situation has been chaotic and collapsing, especially in the new district, which is even more serious. (1) The number of children enrolling has decreased unprecedentedly. Schools in the Jiacun central school district are generally closed. In Yangfan Village, out of two to three hundred students, only twenty to thirty regularly attend. In the third district, the average enrollment rate for junior primary schools is no more than 20%. The old district is slightly better, but generally no more than 50%. (2) The supply of teachers is also inconsistent, with no guaranteed amount. Teachers are demoralized. Some receive seventy or eighty catties, or fifty or sixty catties of rice as salary per month. Some use labor exchange to have villagers cultivate land for teachers. Da Chenzhuang has not paid teachers for two or three years, accumulating two to three thousand catties, which they cannot afford to pay. Teachers have no choice but to "support" the village? Cao Yanzhuang, in order to save rice, allows teachers to sell vegetables early in the morning and teach during the day. Nan Tang village even starved the teachers to the point of leaving to find other jobs. (3) During the Three Check-ups last year, the squeezing out of feudal elements also moved into schools. Almost all primary schools in the county lost teachers and students from households that were struggled against. There were even cases of confiscating stationery, salaries, clothing, and bedding, causing teachers with middle peasant backgrounds to remain hesitant. A teacher in Dong Xianxian dared not discipline two mischievous students from poor and hired peasant families, saying, "I can't let my family suffer because I discipline students." Many teachers also have a one-sided understanding of democracy, letting things go unchecked and becoming the followers of elementary school students. (4) After the Land Law was implemented, some schools also organized poor and hired peasant groups to learn how to divide classes. Several senior primary schools even replaced student union cadres with middle peasant backgrounds with children of poor and hired peasants. Xu Jiangu primary school organized a poor and hired peasant group, excluding the children of village cadres. Teaching was also only focused on the students from the poor and hired peasant group. Middle peasant parents said, "It's a school established for the poor and hired peasants, we won't let our children attend." Salary rice was not provided, the poor and hired peasants could not afford it, and the village cadres dared not manage it, leading to collapse. (5) Some teachers only handle village work, and students are left unattended at school, fighting and making noise, unable to attend classes regularly. Parents say, "It's better to pick up an extra basket of firewood at home to burn!"
    Based on the above situation, after discussion, the following decisions were made: (1) All poor and hired peasant groups and non-mass student unions in each school should be abolished. In the future, junior primary schools should not have any organizations. Senior primary schools can organize student unions that include all students, but they are not administrative power organs. (2) The salaries owed to teachers should be settled before the wheat harvest by order of the county. (3) Children of landlords, rich peasants, or wrongly struggled middle peasants who were squeezed out are allowed to resume classes; teachers will be dealt with after the wheat harvest training. Confiscated stationery, salaries, clothing, and bedding should be returned immediately. If the individual is not present, it should be returned to their family.

　　邢台决定克服教育中混乱现象
  　取消学校贫雇组织
    【邢台消息】邢台县教育科于本月廿三日召集完小校长、联合校长等十四人，座谈当前教育工作。半年来大部是混乱垮台状态；特别是新区更为严重。（一）入学儿童空前减少，贾村中心学区学校普遍关了门，羊范村二三百学生，经常到校的不过二三十个。三区初小入学儿童平均不过百分之二十，老区比较好些，一般也不过百分之五十。（二）教员供给也不一致，多少也没保证，教员情绪低落，有每月给七八十斤、五六十斤的薪金米，有的用拨换工形式给教员代耕的，大陈庄二三年不给教员薪金，积累了二三千斤，出不起。教员无奈，“拥护”给村里？曹演庄为了省米，允许教员早起卖菜，白天教书，南唐村竟把教员饿跑，另找职业。（三）去年三查时，挤封建也搬进学校，全县小学，几乎没了被斗户的教师和学生，甚至有查封没收文具薪金衣被等，引起中农成份的教员至今还不大胆，东先贤教员对二个贫雇调皮学生不敢管，并说：“咱不能因为管学生，叫家里受累。”还有很多教员片面认识民主，放任自流，成了小学生的尾巴。（四）土地法下来后，学校也有的组织贫雇组，学划阶级，有几处高小竟把中农成份的学生会干部撤换成贫雇子弟。许坚固小学组织贫雇组，村干子弟不让参加，教学时也只照顾贫雇组学生。中农家长说：“给人家贫雇成立的学校，咱不叫孩子上了。”薪金米也不出，贫雇拿不起，村干也不敢管，走上了垮台。（五）教员有的光办村中工作，学生到校没人管，乱打乱闹，不能经常上课，家长们说：“不如在家多拾一筐柴烧！”
    根据以上情况研究，经过讨论，最后决定：（一）各校贫雇组及非群众性的学生会一律取消，以后初小不要什么组织，高小可组织包括全体学生的学生会，但不是行政权力机关。（二）所积欠教员之薪金，由县下令麦前解决清。（三）被挤之地主富农成份或错斗中农儿童准许复课；教师麦假集训后处理，被没收文具、薪金、衣被等应即归还，本人不在，归还其家中。（桐生、蓝辉、宋春堂）
