　　The Qiyongquan that Laid Down His Weapons
  　　Suiyuan Correspondence
    Qiyongquan, the Major General Commander of the First Police District of the Ikekao League (i.e., Jungar Banner), attempted to break through and escape when the Liberation Army launched a general offensive against Shenshan, his stronghold, on April 17. However, he was captured midway and sent back to his original residence. This room was the main hall of his headquarters. Except for military supplies and documents that were confiscated, the furnishings and decorations of the room remained the same. The brand-new Russian woolen carpet was still laid on the kang (platform bed), and the Liberation Army sent his wife and children back as well. Before this, Qiyongquan was the Major General Commander of the First Police District of the Ikekao League, the acting Wang (Prince) of Jungar Banner, and the chairman of the puppet "Autonomous" Committee of the Jungar Banner League. Although the 28-year-old Qiyongquan had graduated from the 6th term of the Kuomintang's Central Training Corps, he still had some dissatisfaction and complaints when talking about Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's Han chauvinist policies. He said, "Fu Zuoyi was wholeheartedly trying to seize the real power to rule Inner Mongolia. In Dala Banner, there was Yang Yousheng, a special agent sent by the provincial government, who manipulated the power of Dala Banner under the guise of establishing a so-called 'Organization and Training Group.' In Hangjin Banner, he even forced the Mongolian people to abandon animal husbandry and 'reclaim wasteland,' but the land was seized by his henchmen." The Jungar Banner was no exception. He said, "In our Jungar Banner, Kang Huifang (a Han Chinese), the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Banner Party Department, led 48 intelligence agents and a radio station, who were specifically monitoring me. They telegraphed our every move to Fu Zuoyi."
    Regarding the high-sounding "Mongolian Self-Government" that Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi had once chanted, Qiyongquan said this: "Originally, there was a Suiyuan Border Mongolian Autonomous Chief Executive Office, and Yan Xishan was the 'Guidance Chief Executive.' Later, it was changed to the 'Mongolian Banner Political Affairs Committee,' simply removing the word 'autonomy.' After the Yikezhao League Incident in 1943, it was changed to the 'Post-Disaster Welfare Committee.' In 1946, Mongolian representatives went to Beijing to petition for autonomy. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek was not even willing to issue empty promises." Qiyongquan also had a greater hidden pain, which was the murder of his grandfather in the Yikezhao League Incident in 1943. Qiyongquan himself knew very well that his grandfather was killed by Qi Zixiang, a Mongolian, directly under the instructions of Fu Zuoyi. According to Qi, "Fu Zuoyi once promised the murderer that if the murder was successful, he could become the Wang of Jungar Banner and the commander of the First District. However, in order to deceive the Mongolian people, Fu Zuoyi pretended to arrest the murderer after the murder, but soon released him. Then, Fu Zuoyi openly sent Chen Yujia (a Han Chinese), a special agent, to be the chief resident of Jungar Banner and concurrently the commander of the First Police District, but because of the widespread strong opposition from the Mongolian people, I was allowed to act as the agent." Qiyongquan's grandfather was the Wang of Jungar Banner during his lifetime, and there is still a large portrait of him hanging in Qiyongquan's room.
    Qiyongquan said, "He knows Yunze, the chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government. After being captured, he expressed that he began to understand the Chinese Communist Party's equal policy of assisting ethnic minorities. He admitted that the Mongolian people have only one path today, which is to realize the autonomy of the Inner Mongolian people with the help of the CCP."

### 放下武器的奇涌泉

　　放下武器的奇涌泉
  　绥远通讯
    伊克昭盟警备第一区（即准噶尔旗）少将司令奇涌泉，当四月十七日解放军向其据守地神山发动总攻后，曾企图突围逃窜，但中途即为我俘获，并且又被送回到他原来住的寝室里去。这间屋子是他司令部的正厅，除军用品及文件被没收外，屋子陈设装置一切如故。崭新的俄国绒毯仍铺在炕上，解放军把他的妻子和儿女也送了回来。在此前一天奇涌泉是伊克昭盟警备第一区少将司令准噶尔旗代理王爷准旗伪盟“自治”委员会主席。二十八岁的奇涌泉虽然曾经在国民党的中央训练团六期毕业，但谈起蒋介石傅作义的大汉族主义政策来，他还是有着某种不满与牢骚的，他说：“傅作义一心想攫取对内蒙的统治实权，在达拉牢旗就有省政府派来的特务头子杨有生，以建立所谓“组训组”名义操纵达旗大权。在杭锦旗他更强迫蒙民放弃牧畜，“开垦荒地，但田地却被他的爪牙所抢占。”准噶尔旗也不例外，他说：“我们准旗以国民党旗党部书记长康会芳（汉人）为首，带有四十八名谍报队员和一部电台，是专门监视我的，我们的一举一动他们都电告傅作义。”
    关于蒋介石傅作义曾经唱过的“蒙民自治”的高调，据奇涌泉说是这样：“在原先设有绥境蒙族自治长官公署，阎锡山就是‘指导长官’。后来又改成‘蒙旗政务委员会’，索性连‘自治’两个字也取消了。一九四三年伊盟事变后，又改成‘善后福利委员会’。一九四六年蒙民代表赴京请愿要求自治，这时蒋介石甚至连空头支票也不愿开了。”奇涌泉还有着更大的隐痛，这便是一九四三年伊盟事变中他的祖父的遇害，奇涌泉自己心里很清楚他的祖父是傅作义直接指使一个蒙人奇子祥杀害的。据奇说：“傅作义曾经许诺凶手谋杀成功后，可以做准旗王爷和一区司令，但是傅为欺骗蒙民谋杀案发生后，曾假猩猩地扣押了凶手，但不久便释放了。接着傅作义便公然派了特务头子陈玉甲（汉人）来作准旗主住，并兼警备一区司令，但因蒙民普遍强烈反对，才让我出来代理。”奇涌泉的祖父生前是准噶尔旗王爷，现在还有一张很大的画像挂在奇涌泉的屋子里。
    奇涌泉说：“他认识内蒙自治政府的云泽主席，他在被俘以后表示开始了解中国共产党援助少数民族的平等政策，他承认蒙古民族今天只有一条路，即在中共的扶助下实现内蒙人民的自治。”
