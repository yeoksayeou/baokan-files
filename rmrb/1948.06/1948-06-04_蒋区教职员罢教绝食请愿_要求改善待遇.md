Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. From combined news from Chiang controlled newspapers: In the past two months, faculty and staff in various parts of the Chiang controlled areas, under the heavy pressure of soaring prices, have continuously launched anti-hunger struggles. The Graduate School of Peiping Normal University, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Nankai University in Tianjin, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, and worker-police groups from six universities in Beiyang jointly sent a telegram to the Chiang government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education on May 5th, urging the immediate implementation of the three legitimate demands for improved treatment put forward on April 6th during the strike, research strike, and work strike by the six universities. The telegram condemned the Chiang government for "turning a deaf ear" to the repeated calls by educators in the Chiang controlled areas for improved treatment. As of April, the salaries of faculty and staff at Fudan University in Shanghai had been delayed for three months, and their lives were extremely difficult. The entire faculty and staff of Nanchang Zhongzheng University, named after Chiang Kai-shek, also decided to submit a general resignation at the end of March due to life's pressures. At the same time, faculty and staff at Hunan University in Changsha also sent a telegram calling for improved treatment. As for primary and secondary school teachers, their situation is extremely miserable. Teachers from the four schools of Jinzhou Provincial High School, Junior High School, Men's Normal School, and Women's Normal School in Liaoning Province, due to the delay in issuing salaries from January to April and repeated unsuccessful negotiations, submitted a general resignation to the Chiang Education Department on April 22nd. More than 200 teachers from Fuzhou Municipal Primary School went on strike on April 7th to demand the issuance of back wages and the allocation of food rice. More than 200 primary school teachers in Wuhu, a famous rice-producing area, also went on a hunger strike on March 31st to petition for the monthly allocation of three dou of rice. Wen Ailan, a female teacher at Xieqiao National School in Changshu, Jiangsu, committed suicide by jumping into a well this semester due to being unreasonably dismissed by the Chiang bandit authorities and coerced by hunger. The entire student body of the Normal School attached to the Social Education College, upon hearing the news, angrily accused the Chiang government of destroying social education.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st. Poor people and workers in the Chiang occupied areas, unable to bear the Chiang bandit's conscription and unemployment hunger, are fleeing to the liberated areas in large numbers. In the past month, nearly 300 people have fled from Donggu, Tianjin, to the territory of Wudi County, Shandong. The county has specially set up a refugee reception center in Lianna Street and allocated more than 1.3 million Northern Seacoast currency and some firewood and rice to receive the refugees in transit.
