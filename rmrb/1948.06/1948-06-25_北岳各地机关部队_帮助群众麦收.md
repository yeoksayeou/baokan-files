　　【North Yue News】 Troops and agencies stationed in various parts of North Yue are actively helping the masses with the wheat harvest. Cadres from agencies in Zhengding City are using their time in the early morning and evening to help families of military personnel, revolutionary martyrs, and poor people without labor to pull wheat, pulling twenty-one and a half mu in two days. At the same time, cadres from various agencies in Zhengding County also used their morning time to help the masses pull wheat, totaling nineteen mu. The District Secretary and District Head of the Sixth District, when going to the countryside, pushed their work to noon and evening, devoting all their daytime to helping the masses pull wheat, cut wheat, and thresh. Troops stationed in a certain village, after stopping morning exercises during the wheat harvest, helped the masses pull 580 mu of wheat. Troops stationed in a certain village helped the masses with the wheat harvest, pulling 219 mu in three days, solving the difficulties of 25 households of military families, revolutionary martyrs, orphans, and widows without labor. The Literature and Art Institute of North China United University proposed that each person help the masses with two workdays during the wheat harvest. Other institutes, departments, and classes are also actively helping the masses pull wheat during their spare time. (Bai Jin, Liang Yu, Du Huamin, Li Yinsheng, Liu Bin, Shi Jian, Du Ya)
    【Report from Our Newspaper】 The entire body of commanders and fighters of a certain military region guard regiment stationed in a newly liberated area helped the masses with the wheat harvest, greatly strengthening the relationship between the army and the people in the new area. Some of the masses, upon first hearing the news that the army was going to help with the wheat harvest, were worried about serving the army and were not very enthusiastic. An old lady warned her sons, "Even if we can't finish harvesting in one day, and it takes two days to harvest for them, don't bring the army into the house." Some people even told the Farmers' Association director, "Don't assign people to my house." Wang Qiugui wanted to ask four soldiers to help with the harvest and had bought a packet of "General" cigarettes in advance, and kneaded white flour, before going to the regimental headquarters to ask the instructor. The instructor immediately assigned seven people and stated that they did not want wages, did not eat, and would not even drink water from the people. He also explained to him: The army's food and clothing are supplied by the people, so they should help the people. The soldiers did exactly as the instructor said. Wang Qiugui was stunned and said, "For the first time in history, I've seen ordinary people able to command the army." When he returned from the fields, he shouted as soon as he entered the village: "Third Aunt, you can all rest assured, the army won't even drink our saliva." The army also took the opportunity to explain to the masses that this is the people's army, and it is here to work for the people. From then on, the farmers asked the army to help with the harvest, and the army worked very energetically. Comrade Wang Jun of the Special Service Company shouted after lunch: "Comrades, let's go, we must work like real laborers!" Squad Leader of the Third Squad of the Artillery Company didn't even take a nap, leading the whole squad to help with the harvest. In five days, 280 people from five units participated in the harvest, harvesting a total of 439 mu of wheat, irrigating 154 mu, and hoeing 260 mu. In their spare time, they also did many odd jobs for the masses. (Li Haiqing)

　　北岳各地机关部队
  　帮助群众麦收
    【北岳讯】北岳各地驻军、机关积极帮助群众麦收。正定市各机关干部，利用早晚时间帮助军干烈属及无劳力之贫民拔麦，两天拔了二十一亩半。同时，正定县各机关干部，亦用了早晨时间帮助群众拔麦十九亩。六区区书、区长等下乡时，把工作推到中午和晚上，白天全部时间帮助群众拔麦、割麦、打场。某村驻军，麦收时停止了早操训练后，帮助群众拔麦五百八十亩。获得某村驻军帮助群众麦收，三天拔麦二百一十九亩，解决了二十五户军工烈属孤儿寡女无劳力的困难。华北联大文艺学院提出麦收中每人帮助群众两个工，其他院、系、班，也均利用课余时间，积极帮助群众拔麦。（白金、梁瑜、杜化民、李印生、刘斌、石坚、杜亚）
    【本报讯】驻防新区某地的军区警卫团全体指战员帮助群众麦收，大大密切了新区军民关系。有些群众开始听到军队要帮助收麦的消息，还怕军队难侍侯，并不十分热心。老太太警告她们的儿子说：“咱一天收不完，收他两天，千万不要往家里引军队。”有些人并告诉农会主任：“可不要往俺家发人。”王秋贵想请四个战士助收，事先买好一包“将军”烟，还和好白面，然后到团部找指导员去要求。指导员立刻拨了七个人，并声明不要工钱，不吃饭，连水也不喝老百姓的。又给他解释：军队吃穿都是老百姓供给，应该帮助老百姓。战士完全依照指导员的话做了。王秋贵发呆了说：“自古至今，第一次见老百姓能够使唤军队。”他从地里回来，一进村就喊：“三秋娘，你们都放心吧，军队连咱口水都不喝。”军队也趁机给群众解释这是人民的军队，是给人民当长工的。从此，农民纷纷请军队助收，军队也干得非常有劲。特务连王军同志吃了午饭就喊：“同志们走呀，当长工要当得象个样子。”炮兵连三班长连午觉也不睡，带领全班助收。五天时间，五个单位参加助收的二百八十人，共收麦四百三十九亩，浇地一百五十四亩，锄地二百六十亩。课余时间还给群众做了许多杂活。（李海清）
