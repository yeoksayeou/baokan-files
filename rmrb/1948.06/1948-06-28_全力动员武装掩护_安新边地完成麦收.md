　　Fully Mobilize Armed Escort
  　Anxin Border Area Completes Wheat Harvest
    [JiZhong News] The wheat harvest in the Anxin border area has been successfully completed. With armed protection and active harvesting by the masses, 80,000 mu of wheat fields have been harvested in seventeen days. The general public has been doing the work of collecting and storing quickly. A certain district has also completed the wheat tax collection at the same time. As the summer wheat was about to ripen, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding organized more than 200 carts and more than 30 cars, and forcibly registered men aged 18 to 55 in the Chiang-occupied area, giving each person a pocket and a sickle, preparing to armed robbery of 800,000 kilograms of wheat. In order to protect the wheat harvest, the county party, government and military convened an expanded meeting of more than 1,000 county, district and village cadres in advance, and studied in detail the methods and steps of the wheat protection struggle. After the meeting, the masses were mobilized to transform the terrain, rectify the militia and armed work teams, delineate joint defense zones, and plan to lay mines for blockades. When the wheat harvest began, the militia and armed work teams organized three wheat protection teams, went deep into the enemy area and behind enemy lines to actively carry out political offensives, attack small groups of enemy robbers, and destroy the puppet Baojia organizations. For example, on the 13th, when the Chiang bandits dispatched troops to Dong'anzhuang to rob wheat, our wheat protection team and the militia jointly fought and combined with landmine explosions, killing and wounding four enemies, forcing the enemy to flee back. At the same time, 48 carts and more than 200 young adults were mobilized in the hail disaster area (because there was no wheat field due to the hail) to rush to harvest wheat in the wheat-producing area (wages were paid according to the general market price of the wheat season); and more than 100 militiamen and more than 100 carts were organized in the central area to transport public grain to the border area to help the masses pull wheat and thresh.
    Under the slogans of "Food is the lifeline," "Harvest 70% and protect 80%," "Harvest quickly, fight quickly, and store quickly," and "Don't let the enemy snatch the wheat," the masses in the border area were busy harvesting day and night, regardless of men and women. Many households are pulling, transporting, threshing, drying, and storing wheat all at the same time. The masses actively paid public grain during the wheat harvest, and now the public grain in a certain district has been fully put into storage.
    [Xinhua News Agency, JiZhong, 23rd] On June 11, the Chiang bandits' 16th Army, 22nd Division, 64th and 65th Regiments, and the puppet bandits Zhu Zhankui and others, stationed in Duliu, Chenguantun, and Jinghai, frantically robbed wheat in our Jinghai border area, and were heroically and severely attacked by our local armed forces and militia. In the three days of the 13th, 14th, and 15th, more than 60 enemy and puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, and one war horse was captured. Under the strong protection of our local armed forces and militia, the local people actively harvested and planted crops. Only in the wetlands and dry lands near Jiakouwa, more than 1,230 mu of late seedlings have been planted, which is 100 mu more than in previous years.

　　全力动员武装掩护
  　安新边地完成麦收
    【冀中讯】安新边沿区麦收胜利完成。在武装保卫与群众积极抢收下，十七天中已将八万亩麦田收割完毕。一般群众都作到随打随藏，某区并同时完成麦征。夏麦将熟，保定蒋匪就组织了二百多辆大车，三十多辆汽车，并强行登记蒋占区十八岁到五十五岁的男人，每人发一条口袋、一张镰，准备武装抢麦八十万公斤。该县党政军民为了保卫麦收，事先召开了千余人的县区村干部扩大会议，详细具体的研究了护麦斗争的方法与步骤。会后便发动群众改造地形，整顿民兵和武工队，划定联防区，有计划的埋雷封锁。麦收开始，民兵武工队便组织了三个护麦队，深入到近敌区与敌后积极活动，广泛开展政攻，打击小股抢麦之敌，摧毁伪保甲组织。如十三日蒋匪出动到东安庄抢麦，我护麦队和民兵联防作战，并结合地雷爆炸，杀伤敌人四名，迫敌回窜。同时动员了雹灾区（因下雹而无麦田）大车四十八辆，青壮年二百余到产麦区突击收麦（工资按麦季一般市价发给）；并在中心区组织了一百多民兵和一百余辆大车，到边沿区运送公粮，帮助群众拉麦打场。
    边沿区群众在“粮食就是命根子”、“七成收八成保”、“快收快打快藏”、“不让敌人抢去麦子”等口号下，都是不分昼夜，男女齐下手的紧张抢收。不少户都是随拔、随拉、随打、随晒、随藏。群众在麦收中踊跃缴纳公粮，现某区公粮已全部入仓。
    【新华社冀中二十三日电】六月十一日，驻独流、陈官屯、静海之蒋匪十六军二十二师六四、六五两团，及伪匪朱占魁等部，向我静海边沿区疯狂抢麦，连遭我地武和民兵英勇痛击。在十三、四、五三日中，毙伤敌伪六十余名，战马一匹。在我地武民兵有力掩护下，当地群众积极抢收抢种，仅靠近贾口洼的湿地和干地，已种晚苗一千二百三十余亩，比往年多种一百亩。
