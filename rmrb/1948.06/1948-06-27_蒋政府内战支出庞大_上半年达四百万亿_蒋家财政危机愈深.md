　　Chiang Government's War Expenditure Huge
　　First Half of Year Reaches 400 Trillion
　　Chiang Family's Financial Crisis Deepens
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 25th: The Chiang government's war expenditure is shockingly huge, and Chiang banknotes of 200,000 and 500,000 yuan will also be issued. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd, citing the Dagang Bao's report from the Chiang government's Ministry of Finance: The Chiang government's actual expenditure for the first half of this year (i.e., January to June) was 400 trillion Chiang currency, more than four times the budgeted amount of 96 trillion. It is disclosed that the Chiang government's budget for the second half of this year will be 8 million trillion Chiang currency, rather than the 5.4 million trillion that Wang Yunwu told the puppet Legislative Yuan on the 17th of this month. The news claims that by the end of this year, the actual expenditure will be as high as four times the budgeted amount (8 million trillion). The rapid expansion of the Chiang government's war expenses is the basic reason for the accelerating skyrocketing of prices in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas; because so far, the most important way for the Chiang government to make up for its huge expenditure is to issue banknotes indiscriminately and extort the blood and sweat of the people. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 23rd, citing a report from the Dagong Bao: New banknotes with a face value of 200,000 yuan will soon be issued, and Chiang banknotes of 500,000 yuan will soon be in circulation. According to the newspaper, 50 new American banknote printing machines have arrived in Shanghai.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 22nd: As the first half of 1948 draws to a close, the financial crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek government has further deepened. The Kuomintang's official newspaper, the Nanjing Central Daily News, stated on the 7th of this month: "It is expected that the deficit in the second half of the year will be very large." According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th: Wang Yunwu, the Chiang government's new Minister of Finance, told the Finance and Banking Committee of the puppet Legislative Yuan that the budget for the second half of this year, which is currently being compiled, is estimated to reach 5.4 million trillion yuan. Based on the figures published by the Chiang government itself, this number is more than five and a half times the Chiang government's budget for the first half of this year, which was announced at the beginning of the year at 96 trillion yuan, and the actual expenditure will be far beyond this number. According to Wang Yunwu, the Chiang government's expenditure for one month in May has reached 75 trillion yuan; while the revenue for that month was only 15 trillion yuan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 22nd: According to the Shanghai Dagong Bao news: Since the Chiang government announced the so-called "International Trade Agreement" at the beginning of last month, it has officially reduced the import tax rate on American goods by 30% to 50% from the 21st of the same month, and completely abolished the import surcharge.

　　蒋政府内战支出庞大
  　上半年达四百万亿
  　蒋家财政危机愈深
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】蒋政府内战支出惊人庞大，二十万元与五十万元一张的蒋钞亦将发行。据合众社二十二日南京电引大刚报所载来自蒋政府财政部之消息：今年度上半年（即一月至六月）蒋政府的实际支出为四百万亿蒋币，为预算额九十六万亿的四倍强。据披露，蒋政府今年下半年的预算将为蒋币八百万亿，而非王云五于本月十七日对伪立法院所说的五百四十万亿。消息称：到今年年底时，实支将高达预算额（八百万亿）的四倍。蒋政府内战经费的迅速膨胀，即为蒋区各地物价加速度暴涨的基本原因；因为迄今为止，蒋政府弥补其巨大支出的最主要办法，就是滥发币纸，勒索人民血汗。与此同时，据路透社二十三日沪电引据大公报载称：二十万元的新面额大钞即将发行，五十万元的蒋钞不久亦将流通市面。据该报称：五十架新式美国印钞票的机器已运抵上海。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】当一九四八年上半年度行将结束之际，蒋介石政府的财政危机已进一步加深。国民党机关报南京中央日报本月七日即载称：“预料下半年赤字将十分巨大”。据合众社南京十七日电报导：蒋政府新任财政部长王云五告伪立法院财政金融委员会称，刻在编制中的本年度下半年预算，估计将达五百四十万亿元。就用蒋政府自己公布的数目作根据，此数较之年初公布的蒋政府今年上半年预算九十六万余亿元，已骤增五倍半左右，而实支当更远超出此数。据王云五宣称，蒋政府五月份一个月的支出，已达七十五万亿元；而该月收入则仅为十五万亿元。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据沪大公报消息：蒋政府自上月初宣布所谓“国际贸易协定”生效后，已于同月二十一日起正式将美货进口税率减低百分之三十至五十，并完全取消进口附加税。
