　　[This newspaper reports] The Northern Yue District expeditionary laborers, having victoriously completed their mission, have recently returned to their respective hometowns.

Comrade Qi Yaquan, the chairman, said: This time, the laborers traveled two thousand li, lasting three months, fighting in Yanbei, Chanan, Suidong, and Suinan, overcoming many difficulties, crossing the Sanggan River several times in the severe cold, rescuing and transporting the wounded amidst gunfire, and creating countless moving deeds, providing strong support to the troops, and victoriously completing their mission. After everyone returns home, work hard in production and continue to support the front lines. Amidst enthusiastic applause and military music, eighteen major heroes wearing five-pointed star medals walked onto the glorious hero platform; eighty heroes also stood up; two hundred and thirty-nine minor heroes and eight model companies were all announced amidst the cheers of the laborers.
