The Education Warriors Gave Me
    A Talk by Xu Shengtang, Commander of the First Company of the Assault Battalion that Conquered Luoyang, on the Military Democracy Movement

　　In the past, when fighting, I never considered telling the soldiers anything, just waiting for the "battle to start" before saying anything. The enemy situation and terrain were also only based on instructions from superiors, and I never took the initiative to investigate and research. Once in battle, I would just give the soldiers tasks, "complete it no matter what, even if you can't." During the Xuchang battle, I commanded a squad to seize a bunker, without giving the soldiers any ideas, simply issuing orders, regardless of how they did it, just take the bunker down. It was the same situation during the field blocking battle. I placed the soldiers in the fortifications, ordering them not to retreat a single step even if they died inside.

　　When the proposal to promote military democracy and examine command leadership was put forward, the soldiers gave me a lot of opinions. At first, I was unconvinced, listening and thinking, "You say I command poorly, I say your actions are poor!" Later, more and more opinions were raised. One said, "During the Zhao Village battle, the company commander didn't communicate the situation, nor did he use his brain to research, who knew how to fight." Another said, "Company commander, you can't be careless anymore. Think about it, if you say the wrong thing, it doesn't matter if we sacrifice, what if we can't complete the task?" Everyone criticized me for "reckless adventurism." Upon careful reflection, it was absolutely correct. I only knew to order the soldiers to charge, demanding that they fight desperately, but I didn't know how to charge, how to fight desperately.

　　During those days, I felt very distressed. At the meetings, everyone gave opinions, and I kept my head down and took notes. After the meetings, I repeatedly considered them, thinking very hard, and gradually felt that the soldiers' opinions were fair. From that time on, I kept the "fourteen suggestions for improving combat command in the future" that the soldiers gave me in my heart, thinking about them whenever I had time. Now I understand that every soldier has certain talents, the question is how to develop these talents. For example, during the Xuchang battle, superiors instructed, "The moat is fifty meters wide, prepare to build a bridge." This stumped me. Having no other choice, I held a meeting to let the soldiers discuss it. At this time, I had no confidence, but the soldiers discussed a bridge-building method and successfully tested it. In addition, after promoting military democracy, everyone asked me to make a summary, which stumped me. Later, I thought it was better to have everyone summarize, I wrote an outline and asked each squad to discuss and enrich the content, and as a result, a summary was produced. This time in the battle for Luoyang, I was determined to follow the fourteen suggestions for improving combat command that the soldiers gave me. When I was ten miles away from Luoyang, I investigated the enemy situation for a day, then climbed to the nearby area to see the terrain, observe the enemy bunkers, see how many gunholes there were, and how many crenellations there were on the city wall. After returning, everyone studied it, then took the platoon cadres to see the enemy fortifications, study how to break through, how to occupy the east gate, how to divide the work after entering the city gate tower, and where to develop. The soldiers also automatically looked at the terrain and investigated the masses. After investigating, they came to me to discuss. At this time, I did not express my opinion first, but carefully listened to their opinions. Assault squad leader Xiao Chen gave me a lot of opinions during the three investigations. This time he studied more carefully and actively discussed how to fight with me than before. After military democracy, the soldiers were more obedient to command. With everyone's concerted efforts, our company finally completed the arduous task of breaking through Luoyang. The completion of this task should be attributed to military democracy and the soldiers' talents.

　　战士们给我的教育
    记攻克洛阳的突击营第一连连长许盛堂对军事民主运动的谈话
    在以前打仗的时候，根本就不考虑告诉战士些什么，专等着“打响了”再说。敌情和地形，也只是依靠上级的传达，从不主动去调查研究，一到战斗，只给战士任务，“完成也得完成，完不成也得完成”。许昌战斗时，我指挥一个班去夺地堡，不给战士想办法，简单的下达命令，不管你怎么样，把地堡给我拿下来就行。打野外阻击战时，也是同样的情形，我把战士按排在工事里，命令他们死在里头也不要后退一步。
    当提出发扬军事民主，检查指挥领导时，战士们给我提了很多意见，开始我不服气，一边听，一边想：“你们说我指挥不好，我还说你们动作不好呢！”后来意见越提越多，这个说：“赵庄战斗时，连长不传达情况，也不用脑子研究，谁知道怎么打法。”那个说：“连长以后可不能再马马虎虎，你想想你说错一句话，俺们牺牲了不要紧，完不成任务怎么办？”大家给我查了个“拼命主义”，仔细反省，真是一点不错。我向来只知道要战士冲，要求战士拼命，至于怎样冲，怎样拼，就不知道了。
    那几天我心里很苦恼，会上大家提意见，我闷着头记，会后反复考虑，想得很苦，渐渐觉得战士们的意见不亏人。从那时起，我就把战士给我提的“今后改进战斗指挥的十四条意见”，搁在心里有空就想，现在我才懂得每个战士都是有他一定的才能的，问题是如何去发挥这些才能。如许昌战斗时，上级传达说：“护城河岸五十米达宽，准备架桥”，这可把我难坏了，没法子，开会让战士们讨论试试看，这时我毫无信心，但战士们讨论出了架桥办法，并试验成功了。另外发扬军事民主以后，大家叫我做总结，可把我难坏了，后来我想还是叫大家总结，我写提纲请各班讨论，充实内容，结果总结出来了。这次打洛阳，我决心按战士给我提的那十四条改进战斗指挥的意见去做，在离洛阳十几里时，我就调查了一天敌情，再爬到附近去看地形，观察敌人地堡，看有多少枪眼，有多少城墙垛口，回来大家研究后，再带上排的干部去看敌人工事，研究如何突破，东门如何占领，城楼进门后怎样分工，向哪里发展。战士们也自动看地形，向群众调查，调查好了来找我研究，这时我不先发表意见，先仔细听他们的意见。突击班长小陈在三查时给我提了很多意见，这次他比以前更细心的研究，更积极和我商量怎样打法。战士们经过军事民主后，更服从指挥了，在大家同心努力下，我们这个连终于完成了突破洛阳的艰巨任务。这个任务的完成，是应归功于军事民主和战士的才能的。
