　　Soviet Forty-Three Scientists
  　Awarded Stalin Prizes
  　Cosmic Ray Research Achieves Brilliant Success
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Council of Ministers issued an order on the 29th of last month to award Stalin Prizes to scientists with outstanding achievements in 1947. A total of forty-three Soviet scientists received this most prestigious scientific award. Among them, thirteen received first prizes, each receiving a prize of 200,000 rubles; thirty received second prizes, each receiving a prize of 100,000 rubles. The scope of the awards covers physics and mathematics, technical sciences, geology and geography, biology, agronomy, medicine, economics, military industry, and history and philosophy.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] TASS Dispatch: Academician N.N. Semenov, Chairman of the Stalin Scientific Prize Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in commenting on the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to award the Stalin Prizes, told reporters: "The characteristic of the development of Soviet scientific thought lies in its organic connection with the needs of life and the tasks of developing the national economy. Our scientists, by proposing and solving the most important theoretical problems, have actually helped to solve the main problems of socialist construction." After praising the important achievements of Soviet scientists in medicine, mathematics, applied science, and chemistry, N.N. Semenov listed in detail the achievements of each of the award-winning scientists. Among them, he particularly emphasized the achievements of Academician A.I. Alikhanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Academician A.I. Alikhanian of the Armenian Academy of Sciences in cosmic ray research. "Even in the entire history of physics, this is the most important achievement." N.N. Semenov concluded by pointing out: "The Stalin Prize is a clear demonstration of the Party and the government's extreme attention to science and their concern for its further development. Motivated by this noble prize, Soviet scientists will contribute all their strength and knowledge to complete the great task of accelerating our country towards communism."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] TASS Dispatch: Academician Landau of the Soviet Academy of Sciences wrote an article in *Izvestia* entitled "New Discoveries in Physics," highly praising the brilliant achievements of A.I. Alikhanov and A.I. Alikhanian, the winners of the first-class Stalin Scientific Prize, in the field of cosmic ray research. Landau pointed out: They discovered fifteen previously unknown subatomic elements (note: referring to the components that make up the atom; in the past, only electrons, protons, neutrons, etc. were known), thus giving a completely new perspective on the fundamental problem of physics—the structure of matter, especially the primary problem of modern physics—the structure of the atomic nucleus, discovering new aspects. A year after Alikhanov reported their discovery, foreign journals began to publish the first reports on these types of elements. Landau wrote: Alikhanov and Alikhanian are physicists with world-renowned prestige. As early as 1941, they were awarded the Stalin Prize for their major discoveries in atomic physics. In 1942, they began to study cosmic rays and established a special research laboratory in Mount Aragatz in Armenia. They worked diligently on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level for five years. Among the instruments they used was the world's largest permanent magnet. The manufacture of this magnet itself was a major scientific achievement.

　　苏联四十三位科学家
  　荣获斯大林奖金
  　宇宙线研究获光辉成就
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议上月二十九日发布命令，对一九四七年内成就卓越的科学家，授予斯大林奖金。获得此项科学上最高贵奖的苏联科学家，计共四十三人。其中得一等奖者十三人，各得奖金二十万卢布；得二等奖者三十人，各得奖金十万卢布。给奖范围广及物理学与数学、技术科学、地质学与地理学、生物学、农学、医学、经济学、军事工业及历史学与哲学。
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联科学院会员斯大林科学奖金委员会主席尼斯米扬诺夫，于评论苏联部长会议颁发斯大林奖金的决定时，告记者称：“苏联科学思想发展之特点，在于它和生活的要求，与发展国民经济的任务的有机联系。我们的科学家，由于提出和解决了最重要的理论问题，实际上就帮助解决了社会主义建设的主要问题。”尼氏于赞扬苏联科学家目前在医学、数学、应用科学、化学方面的重要成就之后，并详尽地列举每一个得奖科学家的成就。其中，他特别强调苏联科学院会员亚历汉诺夫与亚美尼亚科学院会员亚历汉扬在宇宙线研究上所获得的成就。“即使在整个物理学史中，这都是最具重要性的成就。”尼氏最后指出：“斯大林奖金是党和政府极端注意科学，并关心其进一步发展的明证。苏联科学家受到这一高贵奖金的激励，将贡献他们的一切力量和知识，以完成加速我国走向共产主义的伟大任务。”
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联科学院会员兰多在消息报上以“物理学的新发现”为题撰文，盛赞一等斯大林科学奖金获奖人亚历汉诺夫与亚历汉扬在研究宇宙线方面所获得的光辉成就。兰多指出：他们发现了十五种前所未知的次原子要素（按：系指构成原子的成份而言，过去已知者只有电子、质子、中子等），因而使物理学的基本问题——物质结构问题得到了全新的看法，尤其是使近代物理学的首要问题——原子核结构问题，发现了新的方面。在亚历汉诺夫报告他们的发现之后一年，外国杂志才开始发表第一篇关于这类的要素报告。兰多写道：亚历汉诺夫与亚历汉扬是负有世界盛誉的物理学家，早在一九四一年即曾因原子物理学上的重大发现而荣获斯大林奖金。一九四二年起，开始研究宇宙线，特设研究室于阿美尼亚的阿拉格兹山，在拔海三千公尺的高原，辛勤观察，历时五年。他们用的仪器中，有世界最大的永久磁铁，单是制造这块磁铁本身，即是科学上一大成就。
