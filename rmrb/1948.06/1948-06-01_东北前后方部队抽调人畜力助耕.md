Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: With spring plowing entering a critical stage, troops at the front and in the rear in the Northeast are transferring manpower and livestock to help the masses with plowing. Approximately 4,000 personnel from units directly under the South Liaoning Military District are assisting with plowing in Xinjin and Fuxian counties. The “Kill the Enemy” unit at the front also extracted some soldiers, all the civilian laborers, and over 1,100 mules and horses to help the masses in the new district with plowing for eight days, cultivating a total of 18,000 mu of land and delivering over 4,000 cartloads of manure. The remaining personnel also used spare time to help the masses carry water, sweep courtyards, and do odd jobs, enabling the masses to focus on plowing. One regiment even helped the masses fill in and cultivate fortifications dug by the enemy. They all brought their own food, firewood, horse grass, and horse feed for the plowing assistance. Initially, the masses in the new district were worried about having to pay wages or provide grain in the autumn. After explanation, they were deeply moved and presented banners to the troops, guaranteeing participation in the army and support for the front. The troops of the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region are also universally carrying out plowing assistance. A certain unit of the field army helped the masses deliver manure while marching. Four squads of the "101" unit delivered over 1,400 baskets of manure in one afternoon. During training, a certain regiment of the 12th sub-district of eastern Hebei formed groups of eight people, assisting with plowing for one hour each afternoon, equivalent to one work-day unit. This way, training was not delayed, and plowing assistance was completed. Currently, the local corps of the sub-district have completed the plan of each person at the front assisting with three work-day units and each person in the rear assisting with five work-day units. To solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for the masses' cultivation, one unit returned the drill ground to the masses and planted crops on it. Another unit sent all the accumulated manure of ten months to the villagers stationed in the village.

　　东北前后方部队抽调人畜力助耕
    【新华社东北二十九日电】春耕已入紧要阶段，东北前后方部队纷纷抽调人力畜力，帮助群众耕种。辽南军区直属队约四千人在新金、复县两县助耕。该区前线“杀敌”部也抽出部分战士、全部民工及骡马一千一百多头，帮助新区群众耕种八天，共种地一万八千亩，出圈送粪四千多车；其余人员也利用空隙帮助群众挑水扫院干零活，使群众得全力种地。某团并帮助群众把敌人挖的工事填平耕种。他们助耕都自带食粮、烧柴、马草、马料等。开始时，新区群众还怕要出工钱，或秋后要出粮食；经解释后，都很感动，纷纷给部队送旗，保证参军支前。冀察热辽部队也普遍展开助耕。野战军某部在行军中都帮助群众出圈送粪。“一○一”部四个班，一个下午就送粪一千四百多筐。冀东十二分区某团在整训中，按八人编成一组，每下午助耕一小时，可顶一工。这样不误整训，也完成了助耕。现该分区地方兵团已完成前方每人助耕三个工、后方每人助耕五个工的计划。为解决群众耕地肥料困难，某部并把操场退给群众，并给种上。另部把全部十个月的积粪送了驻村群众。
