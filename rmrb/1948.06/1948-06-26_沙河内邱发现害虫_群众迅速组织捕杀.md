[Taihang News] Locust nymphs and "Black Poso" insects have been discovered in the sixth district of Shahe and the second district of Neiqiu, and are currently being actively killed. In Yulian Town, sixth district of Shahe, locust nymphs occupy an area of more than 60 mu, and have already damaged more than one mu of seedlings. On the 15th of this month, district cadres and teacher Zhang Lianzhou from the village organized more than 100 men, women, and children to fight the pests with all their might, eliminating locust nymphs on 14 or 15 mu of land in one day. In the second district of Neiqiu, locust nymphs and "Black Poso" have been discovered in three of the four key points, spreading to more than ten villages including Puji Fengtang and Xipang. The most severely affected are five villages including Wucun, where cotton seedlings, black beans, sesame, and peanuts have suffered considerable losses. The leaders of the second district immediately organized a temporary pest control guidance group, and each village established a pest control committee to organize the masses to enter the fight. After discussion, Songcun Village organized the entire village into five brigades according to street and section, each with one captain and one vice-captain, and two or three scouts. Each brigade was further divided into three or four groups, with a total of 330 men, women, old, and young participating. They have already captured 502 jin of pests, and more than ten pest control models such as Meng MaoXiao and Yang QunTang have emerged.
