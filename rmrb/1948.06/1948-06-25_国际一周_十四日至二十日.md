　　International Week
  　14th to 20th
    In the past week, economic and political strikes have erupted in several capitalist countries in Europe. Workers at the Bergougnan rubber factory in Clermont-Ferrand, central France, held a sit-down strike more than ten days ago to protest the company's refusal to negotiate on workers' demands for wage increases. On the 15th, the local reactionary authorities dispatched a large number of gendarmes to the factory to suppress the strike, expelling, arresting, and beating striking workers, resulting in serious bloodshed. The French reactionary authorities' bloody atrocities aroused the indignation of the French working people. A general strike of sympathy took place throughout Clermont-Ferrand, and the strike spread to twenty-five large and medium-sized cities, including Marseille and Saint-Étienne. On the 17th, the French General Confederation of Labor issued instructions calling on individual workers and civil servants to hold a one-hour general strike on the 19th to "express their solidarity with the workers of the department of the Puy-de-Dôme, Clermont-Ferrand, which belongs to this department, and their determination to end police aggression and government provocation." In Belgium, 250,000 steelworkers began "the largest strike since the end of the war" (Associated Press) on the 16th in response to the employers' refusal to meet their reasonable demand for a 5% wage increase. Following the victory of the 100,000 agricultural workers' wage increase strike in Lombardy at the end of last month, and the strikes by workers in cities such as Bologna, Turin, Italy's second-largest industrial city, broke out on the 16th with "the largest strike since the Italian election (April 18)" (Associated Press), in support of workers at the Lancia car factory in the city, who were subjected to suppression by the factory and the police for striking. The strike lasted 24 hours and ended victoriously after facilitating labor-management negotiations and reaching a resolution. The strike by dockworkers and port workers in London, England, had increased to more than 15,000 by the 19th and is still expanding.
    The petition signature campaign by the German people demanding national reunification, which began on May 23, ended victoriously on June 13. In the Soviet zone, statistics from the provinces of Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia show that 93% of all voters participated in the signing. In the British zone of North Rhine-Westphalia, 750,000 people participated in the signing. These figures demonstrate the powerful and universal will of the German people to demand reunification. During this signature campaign, the authorities in the American and French occupied zones of the west carried out extremely vicious persecution against those who gathered signatures, which aroused the anger of the German people. More than one million Germans jointly issued a protest telegram on the 12th, and more than 100,000 members of the Berlin Trade Union held a demonstration on the 14th to protest the American police's search and seizure of the Berlin Free German Trade Union Federation's office and the arrest of trade union staff who supported unification.
    The new Czech parliament, which was produced after the general election on May 30, was officially inaugurated on June 10. On the 14th, the new parliament unanimously elected Klement Gottwald, leader of the Czech Communist Party, as the new president of Czechoslovakia. People in cities and villages across Czechoslovakia held mass rallies and celebratory parades. The people of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, flocked to the presidential palace to pay their respects. At the same time, the new government, with Zdeněk Fierlinger, one of the leaders of the Czech Communist Party, as prime minister, was sworn in on the 15th. The emergence of the new Czech parliament, new president, and new government is a great victory for the Czech people. In February of this year, the Czech reactionaries, instigated by American and British imperialism, launched a conspiracy to restore the old regime and a rebellion. However, under the leadership of the Czech Communist Party, the Czech people quickly suppressed the reactionaries' conspiracy and held a democratic election on May 30. After the emergence of the new Czech parliament, new president, and new government, the Czech people "have consolidated their position as masters of their own land" (Soviet Pravda). They have "obtained all the necessary conditions to make the will of the people the final law" (Gottwald's speech).
    The Hungarian Working People's Party, formed by the merger of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, held its founding congress in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, from the 12th to the 14th. The congress adopted a "program drafted in the spirit of Marxism, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin," which stipulated that the current general task is to consolidate people's democracy, raise people's living standards, and strive to build socialism. The congress also elected a leading body composed of Mátyás Rákosi (former General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party), Árpád Szakasits (former General Secretary of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party), and others. In its congratulatory telegram to the congress, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the great significance of the merger of the two workers' parties in Hungary, considering it: "a historic event in the Hungarian workers' class movement and a guarantee of new victories for the Hungarian working people."
    Israel and the Arab states have accepted the UN Security Council's ceasefire decision on Palestine and agreed to implement a ceasefire from June 11. Nevertheless, the State of Israel is still under the threat of aggression. Originally, this ceasefire arrangement itself was beneficial to the Arab invading forces and detrimental to the self-defense forces of the State of Israel. In addition, Count Bernadotte, the "mediator" appointed by the Security Council, adopted an attitude of favoring the Arab aggressors. Especially on the issue of dispatching military observers to Palestine to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire order, Bernadotte suggested that the dispatch of observers should be limited to countries (the United States, France, and Belgium) that have consuls in Jerusalem, openly excluding the participation of Soviet representatives, attempting to place the power to supervise the ceasefire in the hands of American imperialism. Under such a conspiracy, this so-called "ceasefire order" "was violated on the day of the ceasefire, and Arab forces continued to wage war in some areas" (Soviet Red Star). Even more shameless is that under the smokescreen of the ceasefire, the United States and Britain are conducting negotiations in Washington to sell out the interests of the State of Israel and the Arab nations. According to telegraph agency news: the United States and Britain "have concluded a gentleman's agreement to align US and British policies in Palestine and oil-producing countries in the Middle East." The purpose of this distribution "agreement" is to overthrow the UN General Assembly's partition resolution, strangle the newly born State of Israel, and create long-term bloody conflicts in the Near East to facilitate the continued plunder of Middle Eastern oil and the invasion of Middle Eastern countries by British and American imperialism.

　　国际一周
  　十四日至二十日
    过去一周，欧洲若干资本主义国家内接连爆发了经济和政治的大罢工。法国中部克勒蒙腓隆地方的百古南橡皮工厂工人，于十几天前举行静坐罢工，反对对方拒绝工人要求增资的谈判。当地反动当局于十五日出动大批宪兵到厂实行镇压，驱逐、拘捕与殴打罢工工人，以致发生了严重的流血事件。法国反动当局种种血腥暴行，引起了法国劳动人民的义愤。克勒蒙腓隆全市兴行了同情总罢工，罢工扩及马赛、圣德田等二十五个大中的城市。法国总工会于十七日已发出指示，号召个体工人、公务员于十九日举行一小时总罢工，以“表现他们与多姆省、那克勒蒙腓隆城即属于这省的工人的团结与结束警察侵袭与政府挑拨的决心”。比利时的二十五万钢铁工人，已于十六日起举行“比起战争结束以来的最大一次罢工”（合众社），以回答资方拒绝他们提出增加工资百分之五的合理要求。继上月底隆巴第省十万农业工，增资罢工的胜利以及波伦亚等城工人的罢工以后，意大利第二大工业城市的都灵，于十六日又爆发了“意国大选（四月十八日）以来最大的一次罢工”（美联社），以声援该城兰克汽车厂工人，该厂工人因罢工而遭受厂方与警察的镇压。罢工历时二十四小时，已因促成该厂劳资谈判取得决议而胜利结束。英国的伦敦码头工人及港口工人的罢工，到十九日已增至一万五千余人，迄今仍在扩大中。
    德国人民要求国家统一的请愿签名运动，自五月廿三日开始，已于六月十三日胜利结束。在苏各区，迈尔克逊、梅格棱堡、绍林中亚各个省的统计，参加签名的占全体选民的百分之九十三。在英占区的北莱茵——威斯特伐利亚省，有七十五万人参加了签名。这些数字表现了德国人民有力地要求统一的普遍意志。在这次签名运动中，西部美、法占领区当局当局曾对召集签名者施行穷凶极恶的迫害，因而激起德国人民的愤怒。百余万德国人于十二日联名发表抗议通电，柏林职工会十万余会员于十四日举行游行示威，抗议美国警察搜查、霸占柏林自由德国职工联合会办事处，及逮捕赞成统一的职工会工作人员等暴行。
    五月三十日大选后所产生的捷克新议会，已于六月十日正式揭幕。十四日新议会一致推选捷共领袖哥特瓦尔德出任捷克新总统。捷克城乡各地为此纷纷举行群众大会与庆祝游行，捷克首都布拉格人民纷纷涌至总统府致敬。同时，以捷共领袖之一的波托斯基为总理的新政府，也于十五日宣誓就职，捷克新议会、新总统和新政府的产生，是捷克人民的伟大胜利。今年二月，捷克反动派在美、英帝国主义的策动下，曾发动了阴谋复辟和叛乱，但捷克人民有捷克共产党的领导下，迅速扑灭了反动派的阴谋，并于五月三十日进行了民主的大选。捷克新议会、新总统和新政府产生后，捷克人民“已巩固了他们作为自己土地上主人的地位”（苏联真理报），他们已“获得一切必要的条件，使人民的意志变成最后的法律”（哥特瓦尔德演辞）。
    匈牙利共产党与社会民主党合并组成的劳动人民党，于十二日至十四日在匈京布达佩斯召开了成立大会。大会通过了“按马、恩、列、斯学说的精神起草的纲领”，该纲领规定当前的总任务，为巩固人民民主、提高人民生活标准和建立社会主义而奋斗。并会同时选出了拉科西（原匈共总书记）、斯查卡西兹（原匈社会民主党总书记）等人组成的领导机关。苏联共产党中央委员会在致大会的贺电中指出了匈牙利两个工人政党的合并的重大意义，认为：这“是匈四工人阶级运动中具有历史性的事件，是匈国劳动人民新的胜利的保证。”
    以色列国与阿剌伯双方，已接受联合国安理会对巴勒斯坦的停战决定，同意于六月十一日起实行停战，虽然如此，以色列国仍受到侵略的威胁。本来这一停战办法本身，就有利于阿剌伯侵犯军，不利于以色列国的自卫军。加以安理会所委派的“调停”专员伯纳杜特，又采取了偏袒阿剌伯侵略者的态度。特别在派遣军事观察员赴巴勒斯坦监督履行停战令的问题上，伯纳杜特竟建议观察员的派遣，只限于在耶路撒冷有领事的国家（美、法、比），公开排斥苏联代表的参加，企图使停战的监督权实际上操在美帝国主义之手。在这样的阴谋下，这所谓“停战令”，“在停战的那天就被破坏了，阿剌伯部队在若干地区继续进行战争”（苏联红星报）。更加无耻的就是美英在停战的烟幕下，在华盛顿进行出卖以色列国与阿剌伯民族利益的谈判。据电报通讯社消息：美英“已缔结使美英国在巴勒斯坦及中东产油国政策配置一致的君子协定”。这个分配“协定”的目的，是在推翻联大分治决定，绞杀刚刚诞生的以色列国，制造近东的长期流血冲突，以便利英美帝国主义继续掠夺中东石油与侵略中东国家的阴谋。
