　　Czechoslovakia's Two-Year Plan
    Recently, Czechoslovakian workers put forward a slogan: "Complete the two-year plan two months ahead of schedule." Czechoslovakian Minister of Foreign Trade Gregor estimated that the two-year plan will be completed in October this year.

    The two-year plan, which was regarded as a "dream" by the reactionary factions of the United States and Britain, is a massive "National Economic Recovery and Development Plan." It was formulated shortly after the Czechoslovak Communist Party was elected as the largest party in May 1946, approved by the Constitutional Assembly on October 28 of the same year, and implemented on January 1, 1947.

    According to the provisions of the two-year plan, by the end of 1948, industrial production should reach an annual output of 17.7 million tons of anthracite coal, 23.9 million tons of lignite coal, 1.5 million tons of pig iron, 2.4 million tons of steel, 7.4 billion watts of electricity, and 9,000 tractors. In terms of agricultural production, pork and lard should be doubled compared to 1946, milk increased by 75 percent, and eggs increased by 50 percent. In short, the total industrial output should exceed 1937 by 10 percent, and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture should be completed.

    For Czechoslovakia, 1948 was only the third year of recovering from the war's devastation. During the war, Czechoslovakian industrial production had fallen to only 21 percent of the 1937 level.

    Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the nationalization of industry changed the workers' perceptions. The workers knew that now every effort and every thought was for the republic and for themselves. The labor productivity of workers rose sharply at an unprecedented rate, doubling in the first half of the two-year plan. At that time, state-owned industry was only 17 percent, but after March of this year, state-owned industry has reached 93 percent. All factories employing more than 50 workers have been nationalized.

    In order to welcome the victorious completion of the two-year plan, as early as last October, Czech Prime Minister Gottwald proposed the new 1949-1953 five-year plan. When the five-year plan is completed, the people's living standards will be 60 percent higher than when the two-year plan is completed, the total industrial output will increase by 50 percent, the steel output will increase by 80 percent, the machinery output will increase by 200 percent, and the entire national economic structure will undergo major changes.

### 捷克两年计划

　　捷克两年计划
    最近捷克工人提出了一个口号：“提前两个月完成两年计划。”捷克对外贸易部长格里哥尔估计：两年计划将在今年十月完成。
    被美英反动派看作“梦想”的两年计划，是一个庞大的“国民经济复兴与发展计划”，这是捷共一九四六年五月膺选为第一大党后不久拟定的，于同年十月二十八日为制宪会议所批准，一九四七年一月一日开始施行。
    按照两年计划的规定，至一九四八年底，在工业生产方面应年产一千七百七十万吨无烟煤，二千三百九十万吨褐煤，一百五十万吨铣铁，二百四十万吨钢，七十四亿瓦电力，九千辆拖拉机。在农业生产方面，将比一九四六年多一倍的猪肉与猪油，多百分之七十五的牛奶，多百分之五十的鸡蛋。总之，工业总产量要比一九三七年超过百分之十，农业方面要完成机械化与电气化。
    对于捷克来说，一九四八年还不过是刚刚恢复战争灾害的第三年。战时捷克工业生产曾降低到只有一九三七年水平的百分之二十一。
    在捷共领导下的捷克工人阶级，工业国有化改变了他们的观念，工人们知道，现在每一分劳力，每一分心思的支出，都是为着共和国，为着自己。工人的劳动生产率，以前所未有的速度急剧上升，两年计划开始的头半年，就增加了一倍。那时国营工业还只有百分之十七，而在今年三月以后，国营工业却已达百分之九十三。一切雇用五十名以上工人的工厂，都收归国有了。
    为了迎接两年计划的胜利完成，早在去年十月，捷总理哥特瓦尔德就提出了新的一九四九——五三年的五年计划。当五年计划完成时，人民生活水平将比两年计划完成时提高百分之六十，工业总产量提高百分之五十，钢铁产量提高百分之八十，机器产量提高百分之二百，整个国家经济结构都将发生重大的改变。
