　　The Direct Organs of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regional Party Committee
  　Actively Assist in the Harvest
  　Reaping 1,300 Mu of Wheat in Three Days
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] The direct organs of the Regional Party Committee helped the masses harvest more than 1,320 mu of wheat in three days. At the beginning of the wheat harvest, the direct organs respectively organized wheat harvest committees, wheat harvest brigades and wheat harvest groups to help the masses harvest wheat. The Regional Party Committee attached great importance to this work, and used telephones and letters to promptly inspect and urge the progress of the wheat harvest at all levels of organs. The Regional Party Committee's own organs, the Social Department, the Printing Plant, the Newspaper Office, and the Bookstore harvested 1,324 mu of wheat in three days. The Regional Party Committee started harvesting on the 2nd. In addition to maintaining regular work, an average of 70 people participated every day, and they harvested 304 mu of wheat in three days. Two hundred people from the Social Department participated on the 4th, and harvested 200 mu of wheat in one day. The bookstore helped 115 households in the village and three other villages who were elderly, widowed, and without labor, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, some villages with people on business trips, and those with insufficient labor. In three days, they harvested a total of 523 mu of wheat. The printing plant and the proofreading section of the newspaper office pulled 33 mu of wheat in the first two days. Their enthusiasm was particularly high. In the past, it took six hours for the typesetting room to pick four pages of type. Now, in order to help with the wheat harvest, they have sped up by half the time, squeezed out time to help pull wheat, and everyone carried a bundle of wheat home after finishing the work. This was equivalent to a large cart, and they helped with threshing after carrying it back. The newspaper office has currently organized a wheat harvest brigade, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high. After the start of the harvest, some comrades got up before dawn and blew whistles to call people to gather and go to the fields. After three days, everyone had blisters on their hands, but they were still full of enthusiasm and went to the fields to harvest on time. In these three days, in addition to publishing the newspaper as usual and maintaining daily work, an average of 63 people participated every day, participating in the wheat harvest for three days, reaping and pulling a total of 264 mu, and transporting 30 large carts of wheat. Tan Xiuming, an old farmer stationed in the village, said: "When you urged us to plant early, ten days earlier, we will inevitably harvest more wheat. Now you are helping us harvest, you are really serving us people."
