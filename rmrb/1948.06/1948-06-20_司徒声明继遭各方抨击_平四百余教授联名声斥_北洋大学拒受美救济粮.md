Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 17th: According to comprehensive foreign news agency reports, Stuart's absurd statement on June 4th continues to be severely condemned by professors, students, and journalists in Peiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, and other places. Four hundred and thirty-seven professors from universities and colleges in Beiping jointly published an open letter on the 13th, expressing "strong protest" against Stuart's statement (United Press). The letter listed facts such as the continuous expansion of Japanese police and coast guard forces under U.S. policy to form the core organization of Japan's future army and navy; politically, the U.S. preservation of the Japanese Emperor system and the release of war criminals; and economically, advocating the restoration of Japanese industry to the 1935 level, to refute Stuart's lie that the U.S. was not supporting Japanese aggression. It also pointed out that the result of U.S. economic support for Japan will enable Japan to once again turn China into a colony for dumping industrial products and extracting raw material supplies. The Student Self-Government Association of Tianjin Beiyang University, according to the opinions of two-thirds of the students, has decided to refuse to accept the grain donated by the American "China Relief Mission"; even if it has been accepted, it will be returned to express their righteous indignation at Stuart's statement and the U.S. policy of supporting Japan's threat to China. Students from Nanjing Central University and Jinling University issued a statement on the 12th, refuting Stuart's slander of the patriotic movement of Chinese students, stating: "We have suffered the ravages of Japanese imperialism. It is our right to carry out the movement against the revival of Japanese imperialism. We do not want to suffer the harm of Japanese imperialism again." Nanjing Xinmin Bao also published articles on the 6th and 10th of this month exposing various facts of the U.S. "rearming Japan," pointing out: "MacArthur's demobilization bureau has organized fully equipped Japanese legions," and "The Japanese artillery school has been established under the guise of a 'cooperative farm': seventy-one former Japanese army generals serve as faculty and staff." The newspaper stated that the current movement of Chinese students against the U.S. policy of supporting Japan is "an expression of the Chinese people's attitude."

    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合外国通讯社消息，司徒雷登六月四日的荒谬声明，继续遭到平、津、南京等地教授、学生及新闻界的严正斥责。北平各大学及专科学校教授四百三十七人，联名于十三日发表公开信，对司徒声明表示“强烈抗议：（合众社）。信内列举在美国政策下日本正不断扩大警察和海防部队，以构成日本未来陆海军的核心组织；在政治上美国保存日本天皇制及释放战犯；在经济上主张恢复日本工业至一九三五年水平等事实，以驳斥司徒否认美国扶植日本侵略劳力的谎言。并指出：美国经济上扶日的结果，将使得日本能够再度变中国为倾销工业产品和吸取原料供应的殖民地。天津北洋大学学生自治会已按照三分之二的同学意见，决定拒绝接受美国“中华救济团”所赠予的粮食；即已接受的，亦决定退还；以表示他们对司徒声明及美国扶植日本威胁中国政策的义愤。南京中大及金大学生十二日发表声明，驳斥司徒雷登诬蔑中国学生爱国运动，声明中表示：“我们曾遭受日本帝国主义的蹂躏。我们进行反对日本帝国主义复活的运动是我们的权利。我们不愿意再遭受日本帝国主义的残害。”南京新民报亦于本月六日及十日著论揭发美国“重新武装日本”的各项事实，指出：“麦克阿瑟的复员局已组织起装备完全的日本军团”，“日本炮兵学校已在‘合作农场’的伪装下建立起来：有七十一名日本旧军队的将领，担任该校教职员。”该报称：目前中国学生的反对美国扶日政策的运动乃是“表示中国人民的态度”。
