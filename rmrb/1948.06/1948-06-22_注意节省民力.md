　　Pay Attention to Saving Civilian Labor
　　Liu Deli, the finance and grain assistant of the Second District Office of Jianping County, mobilized civilian labor at the Dujiazhuang transportation station in mid-April to transport 10,000 catties of grain from Wangnanyu Village to a certain village in Pingding. After arriving at Wangnanyu, the village only had 3,000 catties of grain, causing the civilian labor capable of transporting 7,000 catties to make a wasted trip (a round trip between the two villages is about 60 li). On another occasion, Assistant Liu Deli mobilized civilian labor capable of transporting 5,000 catties of grain from Huanglihe to a certain village. As a result, people and animals were mobilized, but not a single grain was obtained, resulting in another wasted trip. The above two mobilizations wasted more than 250 man-days in total.
　　When the Junqu Bohua Pharmaceutical Factory moved, it passed through the Lingshoucheng transportation station. Comrade Xue Rude, the administrator of the department, mobilized 42 large carts to the station, and after waiting for two days, the medicines did not arrive. The stationmaster raised objections and the carts were sent back. Just 42 large carts waiting for two days, calculated as single carts, wasted 168 man-animal days.
　　There are many such facts of wasting civilian labor. These are just two examples. It is hoped that all agencies will pay attention to saving civilian labor at all times when mobilizing for service, and think of the masses for every person and animal mobilized.

### 注意节省民力

　　注意节省民力
    建屏县二区区公所财粮助理员刘德礼，于四月中旬，在杜家庄交通站，动员民力由望南峪村，调粮一万斤，运至平定某村。到达望南峪后，该村只有三千斤粮食，致使能运七千斤粮的民力白跑了一趟（两村往返约六十里）。又一次由助理员刘德礼动员能运五千斤粮的民力，从黄里河亦向某村调粮。结果将人、畜动员去了，无一粒粮食，又白跑了一趟。以上两次动员共浪费二百五十个以上的人力。
    军区伯华制药厂移动时，路过灵寿城交通站，该部管理员薛儒德同志到站动员了大车四十二辆，等候了两天，药品未来，站长提出意见才把车放了回去。只四十二辆大车等候两天，以单卡车计，即浪费一百六十八个人畜力。
    以上这种浪费民力的事实是很多的，这不过举两个例子而已，希望各机关动员勤务时，要时时刻刻注意节省民力，一人一畜的动员，都为群众着想。
