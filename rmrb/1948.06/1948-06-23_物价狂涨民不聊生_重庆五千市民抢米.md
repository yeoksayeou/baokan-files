Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to reports from domestic and foreign news agencies: Chongqing, the largest city in Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," erupted in a massive rice-grabbing frenzy on the 16th. Due to the Chiang bandit grain requisitioning agencies extorting military grain in Sichuan Province, shipping it out of the country, and the manipulation and hoarding by bureaucratic capital and certain unscrupulous merchants, rice prices in Chongqing have been soaring in recent weeks. On the 16th, grain prices rose several times in one day. That morning, the price of rice had risen to 6 million (Chiang currency - same below) per dan, and by evening it had broken through the 10 million mark, with some quoting 12 million. The general public felt an unparalleled threat, and their indignation grew with each passing moment. On the evening of the 16th, a dispute arose between the Fuling Rice Shop in Huangjiayakou and customers due to excessive rice prices, attracting a large crowd of onlookers. During the dispute, officers from the Chongqing Transportation Command of the Chiang-controlled Ministry of National Defense's Joint Logistics Headquarters arrived and threatened the customers, arousing public outrage, which led to the officers being surrounded and beaten. After the incident, more and more citizens gathered, and the rice-grabbing frenzy broke out, spreading from Huangjiayakou and Middle Road to Zaozilanya, South District Road, Liangfuzhi Road, Shibanpo, Caiyuanba, Shangqingsi, Niujiaotuo, Daxigou, Heping Road, Cangbazi, Linsen Road, Lianglukou, and other sixteen important city streets; affecting more than seventy rice shops, with approximately seven thousand stones of rice being seized. The frenzy erupted at 6:00 PM and continued until 2:30 AM the next morning, lasting for eight and a half hours. According to the Associated Press, more than five thousand starving people participated. During the frenzy, large numbers of Chiang government troops, police, and security teams were dispatched to suppress it, and 185 starving people were arrested by armed police.
