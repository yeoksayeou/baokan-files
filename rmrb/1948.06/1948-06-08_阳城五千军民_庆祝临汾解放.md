　　Yangcheng Five Thousand Soldiers and Civilians
  　Celebrate the Liberation of Linfen
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch] The liberation of Linfen is a great joy for the people of the Taiyue region, and everyone is happy. On the 1st, more than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyue held a celebration meeting in Yangcheng. The nearby people came to participate happily, beating gongs and drums and carrying flags. Director Niu of the Administrative Office said: Linfen is a big city in southern Shanxi and a major stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to attack the Taiyue and Luliang liberated areas. Although strong new-style fortifications were built, we only used four hours to open it. This shows that our strength is even stronger. Comrade Gu Dachuan of the District Party Committee continued: "The enemy in Linfen is a big stone slab pressing on the heads of the people of Taiyue. Now that it has been removed, this is a great victory. After the land reform, anti-traitor, and liquidation in our Taiyue area, the feudal forces and feudal exploitation in the countryside have been eliminated. The big and small stone slabs have been removed, the local tyrants and landlords are gone, and our people have become the masters of Taiyue. But it is not enough to remove the big stone slab of Linfen. We must completely eliminate the Chiang and Yan bandit troops. If we cannot further remove this big stone slab, we cannot completely free ourselves." Speaking of the credit for taking Linfen this time, Comrade Dachuan pointed out: It is mainly due to the frontline troops, who are so brave and so wise and brave. They should be the most meritorious, and we must congratulate them. Finally, Comrade Dachuan said: Now the days of Yan Xishan's death are not far away, and the liberation of the entire Shanxi people is coming soon. All the people of Taiyue must continue to fight for the liberation of the entire Shanxi. Wang Xiaosui, a representative of Yangcheng farmers, said: To celebrate the liberation of Linfen, we must respond to the government's production call, ensure that the land of military families and civilian workers participating in the war is cultivated well, and help solve various difficulties of military families and civilian workers participating in the war. The meeting ended with enthusiastic slogans.

　　阳城五千军民
  　庆祝临汾解放
    【本报太岳四日电】临汾解放了，这是太岳区老百姓的一件大喜事，人人欢喜。一日太岳各界五千余人在阳城开庆祝大会，附近的老百姓打着锣鼓，打着旗都高高兴兴的来参加。行署牛主任说：临汾是晋南的一个大城市，是蒋介石、阎锡山进攻太岳、吕梁解放区的大据点，虽然修了强固的新式工事，可是咱们只用了四个钟头就打开了，这说明了咱们的力量是更加强大了。区党委顾大川同志接着说：“临汾的敌人是压在太岳人民头上的一块大石板，现在揭掉了，这是一个很大的胜利。我们太岳区经过了土改反奸清算，农村的封建势力和封建剥削被消灭了，大小石板都揭掉了，豪绅地主没有了，我们人民已成了太岳的主人。但是光揭掉临汾这块大石板，还不算，还必须彻底消灭蒋阎匪军，如果我们不能进一步揭掉这块大石板，我们就不能彻底翻身”。说到这次攻下临汾的功劳，大川同志指出：主要归功于前线部队，他们是那样的勇敢，那样的智勇双全，应该是功劳最大的，我们要为他们贺功。最后大川同志说：现在阎锡山死亡的日子不远了，整个山西人民的解放快到了，咱全太岳人民要继续为解放全山西而奋斗。阳城农民代表王小随说：庆祝临汾解放，我们要响应政府的生产号召，保证军属和参战民工的地代耕好，帮助解决军属和参战民工的各种困难。大会在热烈的口号中散会。
