The Jizhong Steel Department Employs Military Democracy, Plans Carefully, Ensures Victory in Baitapu Ambush

　　【Jizhong, 16th Telegram】In the battle of Baitapu in Xushui, where the Jizhong Liberation Army Steel Department ambushed the commander of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit New Second Army, military democracy was brought into full play, and meticulous planning was carried out, resulting in victory at a small cost and in a short time. Before the battle, the battalion commander personally led company and platoon cadres to observe the terrain at the battlefield, researched various combat plans, and then convened cadres at the squad level and above to explain in detail with drawings. Company cadres made plans and mobilized the soldiers, encouraging them to discuss, based on the mission and terrain, how to fight? When and how to fight? How to complete this mission, etc., and in connection with the actual battle examples of the Xushui Gaozhuang ambush in the past, a security review was conducted. The soldiers put forward many specific security measures on the spot. At the same time, each company convened soldier committees, branch committees, and soldiers' meetings to mobilize, pointing out that to fight well, one must "endure, be accurate, be ruthless, be fierce, and be fast." The soldiers' committee proposed that if they wanted to change guns, they had to obey orders on the battlefield. Because all commanders and fighters were fully prepared ideologically and in action, everyone could conscientiously abide by orders when the battle began. For example, the first squad of the first company was lying in the newly watered wheat field, their stomachs rumbling with cold, but no one moved. When the enemy was approaching, everyone calmed down, their fingers on the trigger, pulling the firing pin, without moving. The comrades of the third squad of the third company were stuck in the wheat field and houses for five hours. When the first batch of enemies passed by, the comrades were a little anxious, but they endured it. Once the battle started, the soldiers pounced on the enemy, who had jumped out of the cars and had not yet deployed, and fiercely attacked them. Because the battle was fully researched, and the comrades had a clear understanding of the mission situation, they were able to fight on their own and squads were able to fight on their own. The original plan was to withdraw at ten o'clock, but the battle did not begin until almost ten o'clock. The commander did not limit himself by time based on the situation at the time. The third platoon of the third company was originally planned to block and annihilate the northern enemy from the wheat field from south to north, but when the southern enemy attempted to reinforce, the third platoon maneuvered to first attack the enemy reinforcements, ensuring the victory of the northern battle. When the company cadres left the troops, some squad and platoon leaders did not mechanically wait for orders, but were able to automatically organize forces to coordinate and pursue the enemy.

　　冀中钢铁部发挥军事民主精心计划
  　保证白塔铺伏击获胜
    【冀中十六日电】冀中解放军钢铁部，于徐水白塔铺伏击蒋匪新二军军长的战斗中，发挥了军事民主，并做到精心计划，以很小的代价和短短的时间取得胜利。在战斗前，大队长亲自带领连排干部到战地观察了地形，研究出多种战斗方案，然后又召集班以上干部画图详细讲解；连干部做好计划向战士进行动员，发动战士讨论，根据任务、地形怎样打？什么时候怎么打？怎样才能完成这一任务等问题，并联系过去徐水高庄伏击战，实际战例，进行了保密检讨，战士们当场提出了许多具体的保密的办法。同时各连召开了士委会、支委会、士兵大会做动员，指出要想打好必须作到“忍、准、狠、猛、快，”士兵委员会提出要换枪战场上就得听命令。由于全体指战员在思想上行动上都作了充分的准备，所以打起仗来人人都能切实的遵守命令，例如一连一班伏在刚浇过的麦子地里，凉的肚子咕咕的响，但谁也不动一动，当敌人快到跟前时，人们都沉着气，手扣着枪机，拉着弹弦，不动一动。三中队的××个同志，在麦地里屋子里闷了五个钟头，当敌人头一批走过时，同志们心里都有些着急，但也忍下去了。战斗已开始，敌人从汽车上跳下来还没展开时，战士们便猛扑了上去，狠狠的打击敌人。因为战斗作了充分研究，同志们对任务情况都有明确的了解，所以能够人自为战班自为战。原来计划是十点钟就撤退，但战斗却是将近十点才开始，指挥员根据当时情况没受时间限制。三连三排原来是从麦地由南向北堵剿北边敌人，但南边敌人企图增援，三排就机动的先击了敌人援兵，保证了北边战斗的胜利。有的班排长在连干部离开部队时，不机械等待命令，能自动组织力量协同动作追歼敌人。
