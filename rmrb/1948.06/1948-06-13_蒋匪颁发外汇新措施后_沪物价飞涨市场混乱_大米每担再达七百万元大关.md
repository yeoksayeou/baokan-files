Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. According to various sources: Amidst the profound economic crisis of the Chiang government, characterized by the rapid inflation of Chiang currency, soaring prices, imbalanced import and export trade, and the depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the "Measures for the Use of Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates" were issued at the end of last month. The measures stipulate that "foreign exchange settlement certificates" obtained by exporters from the Chiang Kai-shek Central Bank for selling foreign exchange earned from exports can be freely bought and sold; while importers must purchase "foreign exchange settlement certificates" and submit them before the Central Bank and its designated banks will sell them the foreign exchange needed for imports. Overseas Chinese and foreigners remitting money from abroad can, in addition to receiving Chiang currency at the official "posted price" of the Chiang government, receive a type of "premium" annually, the amount of which is equivalent to the price at which exporters or designated banks sell "foreign exchange settlement certificates." This new foreign exchange measure by the Chiang government is, in fact, tantamount to recognizing the black market price of foreign exchange. "In effect the new procedure (referring to the free trading of exchange certificates) creates a third exchange rate in addition to the official rate (of 12,000 Chiang dollars to one U.S. dollar) and the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee rate (currently 480,000 Chiang dollars to one U.S. dollar)." (Reuters, Shanghai, 31st) It is generally recognized that this measure will accelerate the development of the Chiang government's economic crisis. Shanghai importers stated: "The new regulations will cause a sharp rise in prices. They say that importers have until now obtained foreign exchange at the open market rate of 480,000 to one. From now on, they will have to give the holder of the foreign exchange settlement certificate a 'premium' of at least 600,000, which, added together, is roughly equal to the current black market exchange rate." As a result, imported goods will rise sharply in price. And in the current economic situation in the Chiang-controlled areas, where everything depends on foreign countries, "the sharp rise in the price of imported goods will naturally stimulate a decline in the price of exported goods, so the new measures will not benefit exporters in any way." According to a United Press report on the 1st: The legalization of the black market price of foreign exchange and the fever of rising prices will cause the black market exchange rate to rise even more sharply, thus forming a race between foreign exchange and prices. Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Committee of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan, also admitted that the rise in the foreign exchange black market may be more violent than before the implementation of the new measures. (According to the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to various sources: Since the Chiang government implemented the new foreign exchange measures, the Shanghai market has been thrown into chaos. On the 31st, "Shanghai's commercial activity has virtually ground to a halt." (Reuters) Then prices of all goods soared. On the 5th of this month, metals, cotton, fuel, and cigarettes all suddenly rose by 10 percent, and rice also rose back to its peak on the 24th of last month, with the wholesale price reaching 7 million Chiang currency per dan, and "the vast majority of rice merchants refused to sell rice." (United Press) By the 7th, the black market for U.S. dollars had risen to a new high of 1.45 million, 400,000 higher than a week earlier, and gold had risen to 73 million per tael.

　　蒋匪颁发外汇新措施后
  　沪物价飞涨市场混乱
    大米每担再达七百万元大关
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方消息：蒋政府在蒋币猛烈膨胀，物价飞涨，出入口贸易不能平衡，与外汇基金濒于枯竭的深刻经济危机中，已于上月底颁布“结汇证明书使用办法”。该办法规定：出口商向蒋记中央银行结售出口所得外汇所领得的“结汇证明书”，可以自由买卖；而进口商则必须购得“结汇证明书”，并缴出该项证书，中央银行及其指定银行始售给其进口所需之外汇。华侨及外国人自国外汇款自国内，除按蒋政府官定“牌价”领得蒋币外，年可领得一种“贴水”，其数目与出口商或指定银行出售“结汇证明书”的价格相当。蒋政府的此一外汇新措施，事实上即等于承认外汇黑市价格，“实际上新程序（指结汇证明书自由买卖）就是官价汇率（即以一万二千元蒋币换一美元）与平衡基金委员会市价汇来（现为以蒋币四十八万元换一美元）之外的第三种汇率”。（路透社上海三十一日电）一般公认该措施将加速蒋政府经济危机的发展。上海的进口商表示：“新规定会引起物价的暴涨，他们说进口商直到现在都是以公开市场汇率四十八万比一获取外汇，今后则还要另给结汇证明书持有人至少是六十万元的‘贴水’，合计就和现在的黑市汇价大致相等。”结果进口品将猛烈涨价。而在目前蒋管区的一切都依赖外国的经济情况下，“进口品价格的猛涨，很自然要刺激出口品价格的下跌，因而新措施对出口商亦将无何裨益。而据合众社一日电：最后外汇黑市价格的合法化与物价上涨热，将引起黑市汇价更猛烈上涨，因而形成外汇与物价竞涨。国民党行政院全国经济委员会委员黄元彬亦承认：外汇黑市的上涨，有较新办法实施前更为猛烈之可能。（据中央社南京三十一日电）
    【新华社陕北十日电】据各方消息：自蒋政府实行外汇新措施后，上海市场顿告混乱。三十一日，“沪市商业实际上已陷于停顿”。（路透社）接着百物即行飞涨。本月五日，金属品、棉花、燃料、香烟均突然上涨百分之十，大米亦已回涨至上月二十四日的最高峰，每担趸售价达蒋币七百万元，且“绝大多数米商均拒绝售米”。（合众社）至七日，美钞黑市更涨至一百四十五万的新高峰，较一星期前高出四十万，黄金每两已涨至七千三百万元。
