Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th. A branch reporter summarized the situation of the enemy and ourselves in the past four and a half months north of the Daqing River, stating: In the Pingjinbao triangular area north of the Daqing River, after the tenacious struggle of our military and civilians, the enemy's plan of "areal control" has been completely shattered. The vast areas of western Tianjin and Xiong County and Ba County are now under our control, while Wang Fenggang's bandit troops have been compressed into a few isolated strongholds. From January to mid-May, our local armed forces and militia alone eliminated 2,843 bandits. Since January, the enemy has frequently stationed more than three armies on the Pinghan, Beining, and Jinpu lines, and in conjunction with local Chiang Kai-shek’s Wang Fenggang troops, launched a frantic "mopping-up" operation against our heartland, but all were crushed by us. In mid-January, a part of our North China People's Liberation Army took the initiative to attack, sweeping across the north of the Daqing River, and in three days recovered the towns of Xiong County, Ba County, Jiugang, Banciaowo, and Kaikou, destroyed the bunker line from Mao'erwan to Nanmeng between Xiong and Ba, and eliminated more than 400 enemies. Wang Fenggang led his troops far away to Xincheng and Baigou River. At the same time, our local armed forces also destroyed 13 bunkers on the Dasha 벌 to Nanmeng line on the Pingda Highway. In early February, the enemy again used parts of the 92nd and 16th Armies and all of Wang's bandits, totaling 16 regiments, to "mop up" our hinterland, frantically burning, killing, raping, and plundering. In Longwan Village alone, more than 100 carts of grain were looted at one time. In Jiuzhuang Village, with less than 100 households, 388 houses were demolished. In Xihouliu Village, Xiong County, more than 300 farmers were killed. Wang's bandits even released poisonous gas in the Anci area in an attempt to create a so-called "no-man's land." However, our heroic local armed forces and militia still persisted north of the Daqing River with mobile tactics. The local armed forces in Daxing crushed the encirclement and suppression of eight regiments of Fu's bandits. Some villagers' militia in Jinwu (a newly established county consisting of parts of Tianjin and Wuqing) also crushed the encirclement of 1,500 of Wang's bandits with a series of village battles. A certain village militia bravely repelled the all-day attack of two battalions personally commanded by Wang's bandits, killing 51 bandits and suffering no casualties among the militia. A certain village was garrisoned by Wang's bandits for eight days, and 10 places of the 40-zhang-long tunnel were destroyed, but the village militia, led by Captain Han Dianying, persisted in the tunnel for eight days and eight nights, killing three bandits with five bullets, and finally transferred safely. At the same time, our local armed forces took the initiative to attack the enemy's weak areas and destroyed 14 bunkers on the Zhongting River line in Ba County. From February 3rd to 27th alone, the local armed forces eliminated more than 500 enemies. By early April, the enemy's offensive was completely crushed. After that, a part of our People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the victorious offensive of our army in southern Chahar, launched an attack on the north of the Daqing River on April 1st, directly attacking Wang's bandit's old nests, such as Banjiawopu in Xiong County and Sizhuang in Xincheng, and completely destroying the Xiongban Highway, the Kaikou-Jiugang Highway, and the Sizhuang-Xiaozhuang Highway bunker lines. Our local armed forces also launched attacks one after another, eliminating more than 400 bandits, smashing Wang's bandit's original 14th Regiment into pieces, and clearing out nine pseudo-big rural offices, including Duliu and Hancun. By mid-May, the vast area north of the Daqing River, including the cities of Xiong County, Ba County, Xinzhen, and important towns such as Jiugang, was completely under our control. Wang's bandits had been compressed into isolated strongholds such as Xincheng, Guan, Yongqing, Anci, Shengfang (Note: Shengfang City was recovered by us on May 31st), Banjiawo, and Wangqingtuo. In the past four and a half months, our local armed forces and militia fought a total of 431 battles, eliminating 2,843 bandits, including Zhai Zongzhou, commander of the 17th Regiment of Wang's bandits, and Niu Buyun, deputy commander of the 16th Regiment. 41 light machine guns, 1 60mm mortar, and 827 long and short guns were seized. 97 enemy bunkers and pseudo-big rural offices were removed, and 198 bunkers were destroyed. Under our continuous blows, the enemy's morale has been declining, and the number of those who surrendered to us has been increasing month by month. The number of surrenders was 63 in January, which increased to 209 in April, and reached 235 in the first ten days of May alone, with a total of 713 surrenders. For example, on May 7th, a squad of the commando team of the 15th Regiment of Wang's bandits, led by squad leader Li Chehai, shot and killed the captain of the commando team, Mei Shixun, and surrendered with their weapons.
