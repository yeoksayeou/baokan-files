　　Chiang Kai-shek Areas Labor Movement
    △ Tianjin News: Workers at the Tanggu New Bureau Engineering Bureau of the Chiang regime have held several strikes in recent months to demand better treatment. On May 13th, workers at the bureau launched a work slowdown due to the Chiang regime's delay in paying wages. The Chiang regime authorities resorted to violent suppression, and several workers have been arrested.
    △ In Tangshan, the Jibei Electric Power Company's power plant unreasonably dismissed two coal-carrying workers in March, causing extreme indignation among the workers in the industry. They demanded that the plant authorities revoke the decision, but the issue remained unresolved until early April. The workers also demanded improved treatment.
    △ Beiping News: 178 employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant were deceived by Chiang's bandits and evacuated to Beiping. On April 24th, they were unreasonably "laid off." The employees, facing destitution, protested to the authorities, demanding prompt and full distribution of "welfare goods, and payment of salaries for April, May, and June at multiples of civil servant rates."
    △ Employees of the Jiangsu Chiang regime's Wujin Grain and Food Office were subjected to salary deductions by the authorities, with each person's monthly income insufficient to purchase a "dou" of rice or a load of firewood. By early April, they had even run out of food. All employees have lodged a protest with the authorities.
