　　Rectification of Errors Must Be Conducted Publicly
　　Duan Shi Overcomes "Stealth Rectification" to Achieve Village Unity
　　[Taiyue News] Duan Shi Town, Qinshui Fifth District, committed serious leftist errors last year, purging 74 middle peasants from the farmers' association. Out of the village's 509 households, 112 were classified as landlords, rich peasants, "struggle targets," and "spy families." They were forced to contribute shares worth 3,876,950 yuan, and 229,684 yuan in shares, 550,000 yuan in transferred property, 12 shi of grain, 7 cattle, over 400 zhang of cloth, and hundreds of pieces of farm tools and furniture were confiscated. Collective control was imposed, restricting their freedom of movement, and they were forced to do unpaid labor, including hauling 70,000 to 80,000 jin of coal. Looking at it now, 88 of these households were actually middle peasants. Before the work team arrived, district and village cadres had done some rectification work, but it was not done publicly; instead, they secretly returned some items to a portion of the middle peasants, without correcting their class status or admitting their mistakes. They also said, "We confiscated your property last year because we were afraid you would waste it; we are returning it to you this year so you can engage in good production." This made many people afraid to accept the returned items, and they remained anxious and unwilling to engage in production. Out of the village's 2,000 mu of autumn land, only half had been sown in over a month. After the work team arrived in the village, they investigated and identified this problem. They determined that the work should focus on raising the masses' awareness and enabling them to consciously rectify the errors. The leadership had to boldly admit their mistakes. The next day, separate meetings of the village's poor and hired peasant association and the middle peasant association were held. At the meetings, the work team first admitted the leadership's mistakes to the masses, explaining the leadership's responsibility. At first, the poor and hired peasants were not enthusiastic, saying, "We have to struggle on our own; relying on turning over is not enough." On the middle peasant side, the general mood was good, but some were vengeful, cursing loudly and even threatening to hit people at the meeting. The work team then held separate meetings of the poor and hired peasant association by neighborhood. After discussions, the poor and hired peasants agreed in principle to compensate the middle peasants for their losses, but they insisted that the middle peasants had to admit their mistakes regarding the transfer of property. After a heated debate, Guo Youbi said, "The middle peasants transferred property out of fear, so we cannot force them to admit their mistakes." Everyone agreed with this opinion. At the middle peasant meeting, those who had been harmed and placed under control voiced their grievances, but they also criticized the vengeful sentiments of a few people. They said, "We poor and middle peasants are one family; they were wrong in the past, but it's not entirely their fault. The poor peasant league is controlled by the cadres. We are raising these issues to correct the errors. We must not hit people or make mistakes again." In this way, the masses suppressed the incorrect opinions and promoted the correct ones. Finally, a consensus was reached. After the meeting, in addition to correcting the class status of 88 households, the poor and hired peasants voluntarily worked with the cadres to return items to the middle peasants and admit their mistakes to them. After the grievances of the middle and poor peasants were resolved, everyone's attention focused on the cadres, saying that the cadres had come up with the ideas and demanding that the cadres reflect on their mistakes. The work team also pointed out to the Party members that the only way forward was to acknowledge and correct their mistakes. The Party member cadres then boldly exposed their mistakes in the work last winter. However, the village head of the fifth neighborhood, Chang Huisuo, not only refused to admit his mistakes but also said that hitting people was justified. After several rounds of education, he resolutely refused to change, and he was removed from his position based on the opinions of the masses. At this point, the middle peasants, poor and hired peasants, and cadres in the entire village had reached a consensus. On the 18th, a unity meeting of middle and poor peasants was held, announcing several decisions to be implemented immediately: (1) All confiscated shares from the middle peasants would be returned. (2) The shares that the middle peasants were forced to contribute could be freely withdrawn. (3) The farmers' association members who had been purged would be reinstated after specific discussions by the farmers' association. The middle peasant cadres who had been dismissed would be reinstated after democratic discussion. The middle and poor peasants all said happily, "This is a great happy event for the peasants of Duan Shi." The 88 women who had been wrongly placed under control all wore clean clothes and said with a smile, "Who would have thought we would see this day last winter?" Yan Jinshui said, "Chairman Mao's policies have come to Duan Shi!"

　　纠偏必须公开进行
  　端氏克服“偷纠偏”达到全村团结
    【太岳消息】沁水五区端氏镇去年犯了严重的左倾错误，清洗中农农会会员七十四人。全村五百零九户，就划出地主、富农、“斗争对象”、“特务家庭”等一百一十二户，强迫他们集股三百八十七万六千九百五十元，没收股金廿二万九千六百八十四元，没收转移财产五十五万元，十二石粮食，七头牛，四百多丈布，数百件浓具家具，集体管制，不准自由行动，并强迫白劳动，光担炭就有七八万斤。今天来看，其中有八十八户都是中农。工作组未去前，区村干部也进行了些纠偏工作，但不是公开纠，而是偷偷的退还了一部分中农的东西；不给改正成份，不承认错误。还说：“去年没收你，是怕你浪费了，今年还你，是叫你好好生产。”闹得许多人不敢接受东西，心中还是惶惶不安，无心生产。全村两千亩秋地，一月多才种了一半。工作组到村后，经过调查，摸着了这个毛病，就确定工作的方针是提高群众觉悟，使群众自觉起来纠偏。领导上要大胆认错。第二天分别召开全村贫雇农会和中农会，会上，工作组先向群众承认了领导上的错误，说明领导应负的责任，开始时，贫雇农情绪不高，说：“自己扑跳吧，靠翻身不行。”中农方面，一般情绪很好，但也有报复的，在会上大骂，还要打人，工作组又以闾为单位分别召开贫雇农会。经过检讨，雇贫在原则上同意补偿中农损失，但没收中农转移的财产，得叫中农承认错误。经过很厉害的争论，郭有必说：“中农害怕才转移财产，不能叫中农认错。”大家都同意这个意见。在中农会上，被伤害管制户都诉了自己的委屈，但也批评了少数人的报复思想。他们说：“咱们雇贫中农是一家人，过去错了，也不光怨他们。雇贫团是干部掌握。咱们提出来是为了改正错误。咱不能再打人，再犯错误。”这样，群众将不正确的意见压下去了。将正确的意见发扬起来。最后取得认识上的一致。会后，除改正八十八户成份外，雇贫农自动协同干部给中农退东西，向中农承认错误。中贫农意见消除后，大家的意见都集中在干部身上，都说是干部出的主意，要求干部反省。工作组又对党员指出只有知错改错才是出路，党员干部便大胆揭发了自己在去冬工作的错误。只有五闾闾长常会锁不但不认错，还说打人是应该的。经过几次教育，坚决不转变，就接受群众意见，撤了他的职。这时全村中农、贫雇和干部思想上已取得一致。十八日召开中贫农一家人团结大会，宣布了几件事情，马上执行：（一）没收中农的股金全部退还。（二）强迫中农集的股可以自由抽入。（三）清洗了的农会会员由农会具体讨论恢复。撤销了的中农干部经民主讨论复职。中贫农都高兴的说：“这是端氏农民的一件大喜事。”被错管制的八十八户妇女，都穿着干净的衣服，笑着说：“年时冬天谁还想到会有今天？”阎金水说：“这是毛主席的政策来到咱端氏了。”
