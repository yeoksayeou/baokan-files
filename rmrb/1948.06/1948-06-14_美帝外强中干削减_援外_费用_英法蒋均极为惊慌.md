Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th - Comprehensive reports: The U.S. House of Representatives passed on the 4th a new appropriations bill recommended by the House Appropriations Committee on the 3rd, cutting the so-called Marshall "foreign aid" plan, which is celebrating its one-year anniversary. This bill reduces the total amount of "foreign aid" funds already approved by Congress from $6,533,710,000 to $5,980,071,000; it also extends the expenditure period from twelve months to fifteen months. The debates in the House of Representatives and its Appropriations Committee fully exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the American reactionaries, as well as their internal contradictions and confusion. Although some congressmen felt that "without foreign aid, agricultural products would fall in price" (Democrat Congressman Canlon), and "tobacco exports would decrease" (Republican Congressman Case), other congressmen believed that "continuous spending will cause inflation" (Republican Congressman Buffett), or declared that "as long as Britain has money to aid the Arabs, the United States should not give them money" (Democrat Congressman Mattel).

As a result of the debate, the faction advocating cuts ultimately prevailed. Although this bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is still subject to discussion in the Senate, it fully demonstrates that in the face of crisis, it is impossible to achieve unity not only between the American and other countries' reactionaries but also between the various American reactionary factions. Although the so-called "foreign aid" plan, regardless of the amount of funds, is a self-serving conspiracy that sacrifices the interests of the "assisted" countries, this has not prevented the American big capitalists and the big compradors of various countries from arguing over the quantity and method of transactions, nor has it prevented different capitalist groups in the United States from arguing over the quantity and method of using money. According to a United Press report on the 5th, the British Communist Party's Workers' Daily commented on this dispute in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying: "The reactionary American Congress was initially persuaded to pass the Marshall Plan because someone gave it a terrifying picture of the Red Army sweeping across Europe, but after the American war maniacs have been tragically exposed, and after Molotov's reply to Smith and Stalin's reply to Wallace, it is becoming increasingly difficult to pretend that Western Europe is threatened by the Red Army." This analysis reflects that many spokesmen for American big capitalists have felt that they can no longer use war propaganda to win votes; but this does not mean that the majority in the U.S. Congress have reduced their interest in invading foreign countries. On the contrary, this commentary also pointed out that those who advocate cutting "foreign aid" funds believe that cutting is "the best way to rein in the countries under the Marshall Plan." A United Press dispatch on the same day stated that the French Communist Party's L'Humanité also said: The U.S. cuts are because the governments of Western European countries are so obedient that the U.S. has deemed it unnecessary to be "generous" in giving them money.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th - The U.S. House of Representatives' move to cut "foreign aid plan funds" has caused another wave of panic in the British and French governments and the Chiang Kai-shek government after the exchange of letters between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In London, according to a United Press report on the 4th, Whitehall (i.e., the location of the British government) was "disappointed and worried" about the news of the cut in appropriations. Whitehall sources believe that if the bill to cut appropriations by 25 percent is passed, Britain will be forced to reduce its imports of grain and raw materials. In Paris, according to an Agence France-Presse report on the 5th, "The French were surprised and displeased." The dispatch also quoted French political figures as declaring: "Regardless of the intentions of the members of the U.S. Congress, this decision makes the work of defending French foreign policy more complicated." In Nanjing, according to a National News Agency report on the 4th, Chiang's government officials complained that "the U.S. House Appropriations Committee's action to cut the aid plan to China by nearly half proves that U.S. foreign and military strategy no longer regards China as a forward post." Note: Although the total amount cut from the entire Marshall Plan passed by the House of Representatives was only $553 million, because the expenditure period was extended from one year to fifteen months, it was actually cut by 25 percent. As for the $463 million aid plan to Chiang, $63 million was cancelled this time, but because the expenditure period was extended by three months, according to the Central News Agency, it "is equivalent to cutting 30.5 percent of the original plan." Not only that, but the case also stipulated for the first time that the supervision methods for Greece and Turkey should be applied to the Kuomintang government.

　　美帝外强中干削减“援外”费用
  　英法蒋均极为惊慌
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：美众院于四日通过该院拨款委员会三日所建议的一项新拨款法案，削减了正在宣传其一周年的所谓马歇尔“援外”计划。这一议案将国会业已通过的“援外”计划费用的总数，由六十五亿三千三百七十一万元，减为五十九亿八千零七十一万元；同时并将支用时间由十二个月延长为十五个月。众院及其拨款委员会的辩论，充分暴露出美国反动派的外强中干及其内部的矛盾和混乱。虽然一部分议员感到“如果没有援外计划，农产品即会跌价”（民主党议员坎伦语），“烟草输出即会减少”（共和党议员凯斯语）等等，但是其他的议员却认为：“继续不断的开支，将引起通货膨胀”（共和党议员布菲特语），或者宣称：“只要英国还有钱援助阿剌伯，美国就不应给他钱”（民主党议员马特尔语）。
    辩论的结果，主张削减的一派终获胜利。美国众议院所通过的这一法案，虽尚待参议院的讨论，但已充分表明在危机面前，不但美国与各国的反动派别之间不可能获得统一，就是美国的各个反动派别之间，也不可能获得统一。尽管所谓“援外”计划无论其款项多少，都是以被“援助”国家的利益为牺牲品的损人利己阴谋，这却并没有妨碍美国大资本家与各国大买办在交易的数量和方法上发生争吵，也没有妨碍美国不同的资本家集团在用钱的数量和方法上发生争吵。据合众社五日电：英国共产党的工人日报，曾对美国众议院这次的争吵发表评论称：“反动的美国国会，起初被说服通过马歇尔计划时，是因为有人在它面前给了一幅红军将要横扫欧洲的恐怖图画，可是在美国的战争狂已被悲惨地揭穿，在莫洛托夫答复史密斯与斯大林答复华莱士的信以后，要伪装西欧受到红军的威胁，是越来越困难了。”这个分析，反映美国许多大资本家的代言人，已经感觉到不能再用战争宣传来争取选票；但这并不是说，美国国会的多数派，已对侵略外国减少兴趣。相反地，这个评论同时指出：主张削减“援外”款项的人们，相信削减乃是“勒着马歇尔计划下各个国家的最好方法”。合众社同日电讯称：法国共产党的人道报也说：美国的削减，是因为西欧各国政府非常驯服，以致美国已认为没有“慷慨大度”给他们金元的必要了。
    【新华社陕北十日电】美众院通过削减“援外计划费用”一举，在英法政府和蒋介石政府中，引起了美苏换文后的又一次惊慌。在伦敦，据合众社四日电称：白厅（按即英政府所在地）对削灭拨款的消息“失望而且担心”。白厅消息灵通人士认为，如果削减拨款百分之二十五的议案被通过，则英国将被迫减低其粮食及原料入口。在巴黎，据法新社五日电称：“法国人于惊奇之余，皆感不悦”。该电并引法政界人士宣称：“不管美国国会议员的用意何在，这个决定使为法国外交政策辩护的工作更为复杂。”在南京，据国新社四日电称：蒋政府官员埋怨“美国众院拨款委员会削减援华计划几达半数的行动，证明美国外交及军事战略已不以中国为前哨。”按：整个马歇尔计划被众院通过削减之总数，虽仅为五亿五千三百万元，但由于支用时间由一年延长为十五个月，实际上被削减了百分之二十五。至于四亿六千三百万元的援蒋计划，此次被勾销六千三百万元，但由于支用时间延长了三个月，据中央社称则“等于削减了原订计划的百分之三十点五。”不仅如此，该案并首次明文规定以对希土两国的监督办法，施之于国民党政府。
