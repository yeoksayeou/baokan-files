  　Correcting Inequities in Mutual Aid
  　Overcoming Obstacles to Unity in Production Between Middle and Poor Peasants
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Xiaowang Village, in the Second District of Xingtai City, immediately transitioned to unified production after completing democratic rectification at the end of May. The village, during rectification, paid attention to absorbing all middle peasants into the peasant association and compensated the losses of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the middle and poor peasants for unified production and prosperity was very high.

    In the early stage of the mass movement after the liberation of Xingtai City, the middle peasant association and the poor peasants fought against traitors, bullies, and feudal forces together. However, in the later stage of land reform, middle peasants were mistakenly excluded from the peasant association. Last winter, production emphasized mobilizing workers, shop employees, poor peasants, and hired laborers, and quite common infringements on the interests of middle peasants occurred in production mutual aid, such as poor peasants and hired laborers using middle peasants' livestock at low prices, and militiamen using middle peasants' carts without compensation. The production morale of middle peasants was once very low. Qing Jing and Tang Qinghe, brothers who had gained benefits during the anti-traitor liquidation and were excluded from the peasant association in the later stage of land reform, would secretly go to sleep in the fields. The spring democratic rectification movement emphasized and implemented a policy of uniting with middle peasants in practical actions, compensating for their losses, and stabilizing the production morale of most middle peasants. Wang Jinkui, a wealthy middle peasant who used to fear struggle and planted paddy fields as dry land, told the village chief: "Now that I'm in the peasant association, I don't have any worries. I plan to reclaim more wasteland in the future, do some hauling in my spare time, and raise a mule." Around the wheat harvest, mutual aid was restored and reorganized, and sixteen groups were organized, involving eighty-seven laborers and more than sixty head of livestock. These mutual aid groups ensured the completion of rush harvesting and rush planting within four or five days. Sun Jing's group, in addition to planting all their paddy and dry land, also reclaimed a large area of wasteland near the railway. However, because many unresolved issues remained, such as the one-sided views of prioritizing poor peasants and hired laborers and the remnants of the idea of struggling against the rich, unfairness still existed in exchanging labor, and the leadership did not adhere to the principle of equivalent exchange, and there was still the idea of one-sidedly "taking care of poor peasants and hired laborers." For example, in the groups of Sun Jinsheng and Sun Huaide, the labor rates for middle peasants' livestock were set low last year, while those for poor peasants, hired laborers, and military dependents were set high. This year, Sun Jinsheng's group still has not changed this unreasonable practice, and many middle peasant households have complained: "The wage rate for poor peasants' livestock was raised high last year. Who wants to suffer this loss again this year?"

    Now the wheat harvest is over, and the busy season of hoeing seedlings has arrived. This year, the seedlings are all growing fast, and life in the fields is very tight. In order to improve mutual aid and overcome obstacles to unified production, the branch recently proposed convening a meeting of mutual aid group leaders to truly study and adjust the wage standards for the summer planting season according to the strength of labor and livestock. At the branch meeting, the shortcomings of abandoning production leadership were also reviewed, and branch secretary Nie Songran reviewed the erroneous idea of one-sidedly emphasizing "taking care of poor peasants and hired laborers" in production. It was decided that in future leadership, the middle and poor peasants would unite and work together for prosperity. (Bing Ru)

### 邢台小汪村　改变互助中不等价的错误　克服中贫农团结生产的障碍

　　邢台小汪村
  　改变互助中不等价的错误
  　克服中贫农团结生产的障碍
    【本报讯】邢台市二区小汪村在五月底完成民主填补，立即转上团结生产。该村抽补时注意吸收全体中农参加了农会，补偿了错斗中农的损失，因此中贫农团结生产发家的热情很高。
    该村在邢市解放后的群运初期，中农会和贫农一起，向奸霸、封建作过斗争。但到土地改革后期，中农即被错误的关在农会门外。去冬生产强调发动工（人）店（员）贫雇，在生产互助中相当普遍的侵犯了中农利益，如贫雇贱价使用中农牲口，民兵无偿使用中农大车等。中农生产情绪曾一度很低落。在反奸清算时曾得过利、在土地改革后期被关在农会门外清镜、唐清和弟兄，到地里背着人就去睡觉。春季民主填补运动中强调指出并在实际行动中实行了团结中农的政策，赔偿了中农的损失，大部中农的生产情绪稳定。过去怕斗争把水地当旱地种的富裕中农王金魁，向村长表示：咱在了农会，啥心病也没啦，往后打算再开荒地，抽空拉脚，喂个骡子。麦收前后，恢复与整顿了互助，组织了十六个组。参加劳力八十七人，牲口六十余头。这些互助组保证了在四五天内完成突击麦收与抢晌下种。孙景等组，除了种好全部水旱地，还到铁道附近开了大片荒地。但因许多遗留问题没解决，即片面的贫雇观点和斗富思想的残余尚未彻底澄清，在变工上还存在着不公现象，领导上也没有坚持等价原则，还有片面“照顾贫雇”的思想。如孙金声、孙怀德等组，去年对中农牲口订的分低，贫雇、军属的订的高。今年孙金声组仍然没有改变这种不合理的作法，不少中农户反映：去年贫农牲口工资提的高，今年谁还吃这个亏？
    现在麦收已结束，紧张的锄苗季节已经到来。今年都是一晌苗，地里生活很紧。支部为了搞好互助，克服团结生产的障碍，日前提议召开了互助组长会议，确实按照劳畜力强弱，研究调整了夏种季节的工资标准。支部会上并检讨了放弃生产领导的缺点，支书聂颂然检讨了在生产中片面强调“照顾贫雇”的错误思想。决在今后领导中贫农团结一致，一齐劳动发家。（冰如）
