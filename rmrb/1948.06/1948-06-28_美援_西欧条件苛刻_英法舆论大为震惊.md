Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Comprehensive reports: The U.S. State Department is currently holding "bilateral agreement" negotiations in Washington with Britain, France, Denmark, and Sweden regarding tariff acceptance of "U.S. Aid" conditions (Note: A bilateral agreement is a direct agreement between two countries. According to the provisions of the Foreign Aid Law passed by the U.S. Congress, each country receiving "U.S. Aid" must conclude a bilateral agreement with the U.S. government, detailing the various conditions that the "aided" country must fulfill. The bilateral agreement is the main tool for the U.S. to control the various "aided" countries). Although these negotiations are being kept strictly secret, some of the harsh conditions revealed by newspapers have greatly shocked public opinion in countries such as Britain and France. According to a TASS dispatch on the 21st, citing news from the British Workers' Daily, "The threat of British interests being auctioned off to the dollar again has caused serious consternation among British members of parliament. Many members are planning to organize action against the conditions of the Marshall Aid." An editorial in the conservative Daily Express also stated that the British people do not know what losses they will suffer in order to obtain U.S. Aid. The conservative Economist magazine, in its 18th-day essay, expressed concern about the U.S. attempt to use the economic difficulties of Western European countries to achieve a policy of making Western Europe submit to the dollar. Newspapers admit that it is too early to praise the original intentions of the Marshall Plan. In France, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 21st, French authorities believe that "certain clauses" proposed by the United States are "too harsh to be acceptable." In Denmark, according to a TASS dispatch on the 18th, as the enslaving conditions of "U.S. Aid" become increasingly clear, newspapers that enthusiastically supported "European people" in the past have now turned to criticize the Marshall Plan Executive Bureau. The official representative of Denmark attending the "Sixteen Nation Committee," in a statement to the press, also expressed great pessimism about "U.S. Aid."
  Although there is dissatisfaction with the harsh conditions of "U.S. Aid" in Britain and France, the British and French governments show no signs of refusing to auction off their national interests. According to the British Workers' Daily, the British government is preparing to wage a "battle of the gods" against angry members of parliament, threatening them that if they refuse to accept the U.S. conditions, Britain will collapse. The newspaper also stated that the British government's strategy is obviously to place the document before the members of parliament at the last moment before the treaty approval deadline (July 3rd) as much as possible. In France, authorities are also now "refusing to reveal the real points of contention in the negotiations" (Agence France-Presse).
 Note: According to various reports, among the harsh conditions proposed by the United States, those that are known include: (1) The "aided" country must grant the United States and U.S.-controlled areas (including West Germany, Japan, and South Korea) most-favored-nation treatment; (2) The "aided" country must grant Americans the same rights as its own citizens to invest in and develop the resources of the "aided" country and its territories; (3) The "aided" country must lower trade barriers; (4) The "aided" country must devalue its currency when necessary.

　　“美援”西欧条件苛刻
  　英法舆论大为震惊
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：美国务院刻正与英、法、丹麦、瑞典四国在华盛顿举行关税接受“美援”条件的“双边协定”谈判（按双边协定即两国间的直接协定。依照美国国会通过之援外法的规定，每个接受“美援”的国家，均须与美政府缔结一双边协定，详载受“援”国家须予履行之种种条件。双边协定是美国控制各受“援”国家的主要工具）。虽然这一谈判尚被严守秘密，但据报纸透露的若干苛刻条件，已使英法等国舆论界大为震惊。据塔斯社二十一日电引英国工人日报消息称：“英国利益再次拍卖给美元的威胁，已在英国议员中引起严重的惊骇。许多议员正谋组织反对马歇尔援助条件的行动”。保守党每日快报的社论也说，为了获得美援，英国人民不知道将遭受何种损失。保守的经济学家杂志，在其十八日的论文中，对美国企图利用西欧国家的经济困难，以达到使西欧屈服于美元的政策表示忧虑。报刊承认，对马歇尔计划的原事赞扬是为时过早了。在法国，据法新社二十一日电，法国权威人士认为，美国提出的“某些条款，苛刻得难以接受”。在丹麦，据塔斯社十八日消息称，由于“美援”的奴役条件愈益明显，过去热烈拥护“欧洲人民”的报纸，现在又转而抨击马歇尔计划执行局了。丹麦出席“十六国委员会”的官方代表，在向报界发表的谈话中，亦对“美援”表示十分悲观。
    英法国内虽对“美援”苛刻条件不满，但英法政府并无拒绝拍卖其国家利益的征象。据英国工人日报揭露，英政府正准备对愤怒的议员们进行“神之战”，恫吓他们说：如果拒绝接受美国的条件，英国将会垮台。该报又称：英政府的策略，显然是尽可能在条约批准限期（七月三日）以前的最后片刻，把该项文件置于议员们之前。在法国，权威人士现亦“拒绝透露谈判的真正分歧之点”（法新社）。
    按：据各方报导，美国提出的苛刻条件中，已知者就有：（一）受“援”国必须给予美国及美国控制区（包括西德、日本、南鲜）以最惠国条款之待遇；（二）受“援”国必须予美国人以与各该国国民同等投资和开发受“援”国及其属地资源之权；（三）受“援”国必须降低贸易壁垒；（四）受“援”国于必要时须贬低币值。
