Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Comprehensive report: The British Labour Party concluded its 47th annual conference, or the third annual conference since taking office, on the 21st. The conference began on the 17th and lasted for five days. A significant point of this conference was the Labour Party leadership's lack of confidence in the party's fate in the 1950 general election. Attlee's report on the work of the parliamentary Labour Party group last year fully revealed this point. He said: "The Labour Party faces a severe test" (TASS). This year, the Labour Party leaders were even less tolerant of allowing delegates to freely speak and discuss policies than in previous years. Various motions regarding foreign policy issues, which have been the subject of intense debate at previous annual conferences since the Labour Party took office, were almost entirely eliminated by the procedural committee at this conference, resulting in only "two motions": one supporting Bevin's pro-American diplomacy, and the other calling for severing all military ties with the United States and engaging in close cooperation with the Soviet Union. Then, the conference leaders used various excuses to prevent or even cancel the speaking rights of delegates who attempted to criticize the authorities. For example, when London delegate Cobb wanted to talk about the importance of developing Anglo-Soviet trade, the chairman did not allow him to present arguments, saying that he was deviating from the meeting. When Zilliacus responded to Attlee's criticism of him, he was also prevented from finishing his speech. And some motions were voted on by a show of hands without any discussion at all. The Labour Party authorities used such methods to achieve their own goals, that is, this conference simply approved all the government's announcements on domestic and foreign policies. "Everything is lovely in the garden, then go home for tea" (Zilliacus's words). Therefore, many motions agreed to by the Labour Party Executive Committee, including expelling Mills from the party, continuing anti-communism, and strengthening the activities of the Western European bloc, were all "passed by a show of hands." Nevertheless, the conference also put the Labour Party authorities in an embarrassing situation on the Palestine issue. When Russell, a member of the Jewish Affairs Bureau, demanded at the meeting that Britain recognize the State of Israel, abolish the Anglo-Transjordanian treaty, and withdraw British commanders from the Transjordanian army (the Arab army that attacked Jewish residential areas in Palestine), the Labour Party authorities found that this demand was clearly unacceptable to Bevin and publicly rejected it. Because it was unfavorable to the Labour Party government, Morrison came forward outside the meeting to "persuade" Bevin to not express his personal hostility towards the Jews in his foreign policy speech. "Bevin agreed not to mention the Palestine issue at all, but the Foreign Office's policy remains unchanged." (Agence France-Presse) The Palestine issue was glossed over in this way.

　　英工党年会暗淡无光
  　代表无充分发言权
    艾德礼对下届选举失信心
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合报导：英国工党于二十一日结束了它的第四十七届年会，或执政以来的第三届年会。年会于十七日开始，历时五日。本届会议显著之点，是工党领导机关对该党在一九五○年大选中的命运感到信心不足。会上艾德礼关于议会工党党团在去年的工作报告，即充分表露此点。他说：“工党面临严重的考验”（塔斯社）。工党首脑们今年对会议的方针，比往年更加不容许，与会代表们自由发言讨论政策。工党执行以来即成为其历届年会上激烈争辩主题的关于外交政策问题的各项议案，在这次会议上几乎统统被程序委员会所勾消，结果只留下“两个议案”，一是赞成贝文亲美外交，一是要求割断与美国一切军事联系，而与苏联进行密切合作。然后会议领导者又以各种借口，阻止了甚至取消了试图批评当局的代表们的发言权。例如当伦敦代表哥布想讲发展英苏贸易的重要性时，主席不准他提出论据，说他离开了会议。齐里亚库斯答复艾德礼对他的批评时，也被阻止不许说完。而有些议案则根本不予讨论即行举手表决。工党当局就用了诸如此类的办法，以达到自己的目的，此即这一大会只简单批准政府在国内外政策上所作的一切宣告。“花园里一切都可爱，然后回家喝茶去”（齐里亚库斯语），因此工党执委会所同意的许多议案，包括开除米尔斯党籍，继续反共，加强西欧集团活动等等，都被“举手通过”了。虽然如此，会议亦曾使工党当局在巴勒斯坦问题上陷于狼狈状态。当犹太事务局委员罗塞尔在会上要求英国承认以色列国，废除英与外约旦条约，从外约旦军队（进攻巴勒斯坦犹太居民区的阿拉伯军队主义）中撤回英国指挥官时，工党当局发现这一要求显然不能为贝文所接受而公开拒绝。因对工党政府不利，于是乃由摩里逊出面在会外“说服”了贝文，要他在其外交政策演说中，不要表示他们人对犹太人的敌对态度，“贝文同意对巴勒斯坦问题一字不提，但外交部政策不变。”（法新社）巴勒斯坦问题就这样混过的。
