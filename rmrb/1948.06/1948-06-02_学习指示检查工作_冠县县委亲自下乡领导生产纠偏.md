　　Studying Instructions and Inspecting Work
  　Guanxian County Party Committee Personally Goes to the Countryside to Lead Production and Correct Deviations
    [Jinan News] After studying the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taihang and Taiyue District Party Committees in light of local conditions, the Guanxian County Committee believed that the correction of "leftist" deviations in spring production in Guanxian was not resolute or thorough enough. Based on the document, they examined the following two issues: 1. The compensation for wrongly struggled middle peasants, the unsealing of wrongly sealed middle peasant doors, and other corrections of damages to the interests of middle peasants were not resolute enough. Although the County Committee clearly stated in two district cadre conferences and two instructions that it would combine loans and grain lending to stabilize production sentiment and implement the middle peasant policy, execution was still insufficient because the County Committee itself was not resolute in its thinking on correcting deviations, and it encountered some obstacles, such as the resistance of some village cadres' thinking (fear of losing face if they were said to have wrongly struggled), and some only considered immediate interests. In addition, leadership only made calls and arrangements without in-depth inspection and supervision. For example, Xiaozigu in the Seventh District sealed off three middle peasant households and three well-to-do middle peasant households. Because they feared opposition from the masses, they only unsealed the middle peasants and did not unseal the well-to-do middle peasants. In the Fifth District, 34 villages sealed off 126 households. Except for a portion of the obviously middle peasant households that were unsealed, most had not yet been resolved. Therefore, the production sentiment of middle peasants was still not high. Generally, they had already spread the existing manure on the fields and sowed seeds, but very few bought fertilizer. Chen Shuyin, a well-to-do middle peasant in Houtanggu in the First District, used to have the best crops, but this year he was discouraged. He said, "It's enough to just barely get by with food and drink! What's the point of trying to live better?" Chen Guangyu, a well-to-do middle peasant, doubted and said, "It's production time, the higher-ups shouldn't be saying this!" He feared that the policies would change again later. Zhang Rushan, a middle peasant in Nanjie, Guangchengguan, did not apply bean cake to the fields after the spring land was sown, but only thought about selling some things. In short, leadership only promoted the middle peasant policy, but in reality, many infringements on the interests of middle peasants were not well resolved, so the middle peasants were always skeptical about the policy, and their enthusiasm for production remained low. 2. Upon receiving instructions to abolish control over landlords and rich peasants, the County Committee hesitated ideologically and showed resistance, believing that it would be difficult to implement and would directly harm the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, and that landlords and rich peasants would definitely take the opportunity to counterattack. The County Committee examined these two issues and has now begun to correct them. First, the County Committee personally went to the countryside to investigate and understand the situation, and decided to convene a district cadre conference in the latter half of the month to correct policies, improve the production enthusiasm of all classes, and carry out summer production work.

　　学习指示检查工作
  　冠县县委亲自下乡领导生产纠偏
    【冀南消息】冠县县委会、结合当地情况，学习了中央局给太行、太岳区党委的指示后、认为冠县在春季生产中的纠左是不坚决不彻底的。根据文件检查了下面两个问题：一、对错斗中农的弥补，错封中农门的启封，及其他损害中农利益等纠正都不够坚决。县委虽在两次区干大会上及两次指示上都明确了结合贷款、贷粮，安定生产情绪，贯彻执行中农政策，但因县委本身纠偏思想不坚决，又遇到一些障碍，象某些村干思想的抵抗（怕说斗错了丢人），某些只从眼前利益出发，再加领导上只有号召布置，没有深入的检查督促，所以执行的还很不够。七区孝子固封了三家中农，三家富裕中农，因为怕群众反对，光把中农启封，没有启封富裕中农。五区卅四个村，查封了一百二十六户，除了很明显的中农启封了一部分，多数还没有解决。因此中农生产情绪还是不高，一般的也都把现有的粪拉到地里播了种，但买肥料的很少。一区后唐古富裕中农陈书印，往年他的庄稼最好，今年也泄了劲，他说：“糊糊弄弄的有吃有喝算啦！往好处过干啥？”富裕中农陈广雨怀疑说：“这时候正生产，上级该不这样说呀！”怕到时候法令再变。光城关南街中农张如山，春地种完了，有豆饼也不往地里上，光想法卖点东西。总之，领导上光有中农政策的宣传，实际上许多侵犯中农利益的事没有很好解决，所以中农对政策总是怀疑，生产劲头仍不高。二、接到取消对地富控制指示，县委思想上犹豫，表现抵抗，认为很难行得通，觉得这样做会直接危害贫雇利益，地富一定乘机反攻。县委检查了这两个问题，现已着手纠正，首先县委亲自下乡调查，了解材料，并决定在下旬召开区干会，端正政策，提高各阶层的生产情绪，开展夏季生产工作。（冠县县委会）
