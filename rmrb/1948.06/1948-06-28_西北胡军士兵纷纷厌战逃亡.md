Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: Soldiers of Hu Zongnan's army in the Northwest, including the 36th Division, are weary of war and deserting in large numbers, seeking refuge in the Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The local democratic government has taken in 354 Hu army deserters in just two days. According to Hu army deserters Zhang Xichang and Ma Yulin from the 113th Brigade of the 36th Division, after the brigade was completely annihilated in Shajiadian, Mizhi, last August, they forcibly conscripted recruits everywhere in Xi'an and pieced together over 1,400 police officers from various counties to replenish their ranks. However, the soldiers heard that the Shanbei Liberation Army was formidable in battle and were unwilling to risk their lives for Hu Zongnan. In early April, when the brigade was transferred north from Shangxian to aid Luochuan, more than 100 men from the 7th Company of the 368th Regiment deserted, leaving only about 50 men; the Special Service Company of the辎重 Battalion had only 30-odd men left. In order to "stabilize morale," the battalion commander deceived the soldiers by saying, "We are a newly established unit, and the higher-ups have ordered us to guard the rear and not go to the front lines, so everyone should not be afraid." But when the Liberation Army advanced into the Jingwei area for combat, the brigade was transferred west again. The soldiers were exhausted and unable to walk, so Zhang Xichang, Ma Yulin, and others took the opportunity to desert to the border region. In addition, many stragglers were captured by our militia and guerrillas. In the two days of the 13th and 14th of last month, the Guanzhong militia captured 41 enemy stragglers, seizing 2 machine guns and 19 rifles. Furthermore, enemy soldiers in Yulin on the northern front of the border region are also deserting one after another. According to statistics from a Kuomintang army reception station of our unit, 140 Yulin deserters were received from January to April.

　　西北胡军士兵纷纷厌战逃亡
    【新华社西北二十六日电】西北胡宗南军三十六师等部士兵厌战逃亡，纷纷投奔陕甘宁关中分区。当地民主政府仅在两天内即收容胡军逃兵三百五十四名。据敌三十六师一一三旅逃兵张喜昌、马玉林称：该旅自去年八月在米脂沙家店被全歼后，即又在西安到处抽抓壮丁，并拼凑各县保警队一千四百多人补充而成。但士兵们又听得陕北解放军打仗厉害，均不愿替胡军卖命。四月初该旅从商城北援洛川时，三六八团七连百余人跑得只剩下五十余人，辎重营特务连只剩下三十多人。营长为了“安定军心”，乃欺骗士兵说：“咱们是新成立的部队，上边命令只叫咱们守后方不去前线，大家不要害怕。”但当解放军挺进泾渭地区作战后，该旅又被西调。士兵们因疲于奔命走不动路，于是张喜昌、马玉林等乃乘机逃奔边区。此外许多掉队的散兵，也在我民兵游击队搜捕中被俘。上月十三、十四日两天中，关中民兵即捕捉敌散兵四十一人，缴获机枪二挺，步枪十九支。又：边区北线榆林敌军亦相继逃亡，据我某部一个蒋军招待所的统计，一月至四月即收容榆林逃兵一百四十名。
