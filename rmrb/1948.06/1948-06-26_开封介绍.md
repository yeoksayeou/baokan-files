　　Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, is one of China's five ancient capitals, along with Xi'an, Luoyang, Beiping, and Nanjing. It was known as Bianjing in ancient times and served as the capital for the Wei during the Warring States period, the Liang, Jin, Han, and Zhou during the Five Dynasties, and the Northern Song after the Five Dynasties. The city is located on the vast plains of northeastern Henan, backing onto the Yellow River in the north and bordering the Longhai Railway in the south. With smooth highways and flourishing commerce, its population reaches 400,000, making it the largest city in Central China. The city is home to Henan University, the only university in Henan, and has the most primary and secondary schools in the province. Last August, when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) attacked the Longhai Railway, our local troops once raided the southern gate and airport of Kaifeng. The current liberation of the city marks the first time the PLA has captured a provincial capital within the Guannei region (areas within the passes). Of the three major towns on the Henan section of the Longhai Railway (Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang), only Zhengzhou remains unliberated.

　　开封介绍
    开封为河南省的省会，与西安、洛阳、北平、南京同为中国五大古都之一，古称汴京，战国的魏，五代的梁、晋、汉、周，和五代以后的北宋都曾建都于此。该城位于河南东北部大平原上，北倚黄河，南临陇海路，公路畅通，商业繁盛，人口达四十万，为中州第一大城。城内有河南唯一的大学“河南大学”，中小学校之多为全省第一。去年八月解放军破击陇海路时，我地方兵团曾一度袭入开封南关及机场。此次解放该城，为解放军在内战中攻克关内省会的第一次。河南陇海线上三大重镇（开封、郑州、洛阳），现未解放者仅郑州一处。
