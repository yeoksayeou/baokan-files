　　A Very Serious Famine
　　Da Kong Village, in the sixth district of Yuanshi County, has suffered severe devastation in recent years under the rule and plunder of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Wei Yonghe bandit gang. Most of the fields were barren. Moreover, last year it suffered a serious drought. The entire village, consisting of 185 households and 817 people, only harvested 295.6 *shi* of grain last autumn. Of this, 66.15 *shi* were seized by the enemy, and 30 *shi* were allocated for burdens. The remaining grain averaged just over two *dou* per person. In reality, 38 households with 137 people had no harvest at all, and 13 households with 66 people averaged less than one *dou* of grain each. At that time, both middle peasants, poor peasants, and even families with some savings faced extremely serious famine. Village chief Li Lianchun said: “Our village suffered famine in every household. After last autumn, no one thought they could survive until now, and no one thought they could eat this year's wheat.”

　　Disaster Relief Production, Overcoming the Spring Famine
　　This historically rare famine was overcome by the people under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Da Kong Village Production Committee found the following points in the preliminary summary of the achievements and experiences of this famine:

　　1. Disaster Relief Loans Played a Major Role
　　In the half year after liberation until the wheat harvest, the government distributed 2,000 *jin* of relief grain, loaned 7,000 *jin* of grain, and provided four loans totaling 2.7 million yuan (冀钞, Ji currency, same below). It also loaned 639 *jin* of cotton, 4,000 *jin* of relief grain, and 3,000 *jin* of vegetables. A total of 160 households and 763 people received relief and loans, and all the loans were used to support textile production and *hu pukan shang* (engaging in arduous entrepreneurship such as carrying loads and peddling). For example, Li Ranji, a family of four, borrowed 20,000 yuan this spring and earned 11,000 yuan by participating in government-organized transportation production. He then used this 31,000 yuan as capital for production. In addition to food, he earned another 6,000 yuan. Later, he combined agricultural production with spinning to earn over 5,000 yuan. He said: "Without this loan, I wouldn't be able to plant an acre of land, and I wouldn't be able to survive the famine." Zhang Wenxiang received 60 *jin* of relief grain, which fed his family of three for a month. Later, he borrowed 2,200 yuan and engaged in production. In addition to food, he also bought five big *dou* of grain and planted spring seedlings. He said: "If it weren't for the loan, let alone planting the land, I wouldn't even have seeds." Li Lianchun, a family of four, borrowed 100 *jin* of grain and two loans totaling 35,000 yuan. His son, Li Liushen, transported goods with the loan and earned a big *dou* of grain. His father, Li Laohe (80 years old), used the capital to spin day and night, earning over 30,000 yuan this spring. Li Lianchun himself earned over 20,000 yuan by ginning cotton at home. The whole family earned a total of over 70,000 yuan, and all the land was planted. He said that if it weren't for the loans, not only would they not be able to plant the land, but some of them would have starved to death.

　　2. Do Whatever is Profitable, Hurry to *Pukan* to Make a Living
　　Winter and spring sideline production played a decisive role in overcoming the spring famine. First, all the men in the village were mobilized, using loans as capital to engage in production. There were over 90 villagers constantly engaging in carrying goods and 30 carts. Their slogan was: "Do whatever is profitable, hurry to *pukan* to make a living." Before the new year, a large number of laborers were organized to transport cabbage, setting off in the middle of the night and arriving at Dashiqiao in Zhao County (40 *li* from Da Kong) at dawn. They bought cabbage and returned to Yuanshi City to sell it, arriving home in the late evening. The round trip was 115 *li*. Over 150 households participated in selling cabbage, some pushing carts, some carrying with shoulder poles. Women such as Li Qun and Zhang Fengluan also participated in carrying cabbage, carrying over 30 *jin* at a time. Li Tangzi, who was over 60 years old, even pushed over 150 *jin*. Wang Lianzhen's family of two, with one cart and one shoulder pole, exchanged cabbage for seven cloth bags of grain. By the end of the year, in addition to feeding the family of seven, they had more than one extra bag of grain. Li Quanfu, relying only on a shoulder pole, exchanged goods for five bags of grain (about four *shi*). In addition to selling cabbage, there were also two households selling bitter salt, eleven households selling tofu, and over ten households selling mixed noodles and sesame cakes. In the period before the new year alone, the whole village earned over 300 *shi* of grain through *hu pukan*, solving the winter famine and laying the foundation for overcoming the spring famine.

　　In the spring, they continued to step up *pukan*. In the three and a half months before the wheat harvest alone, according to incomplete statistics from the whole village, they earned 1,825,500 yuan and 17.5 *shi* of grain. The money earned could buy 71.3 *da shi* of grain at the market price at that time.

　　3. Men and Women Weaving Day and Night
　　Textile income also played a significant role in overcoming the famine. Under the call for voluntary grouping, 128 households and 13 groups (mainly sharing lighting groups) participated in the spinning groups. All 36 looms and 187 spinning wheels in the village were in operation. Zhang Lanchen, a 12-year-old girl, spun half a *jin* of cotton on the market scale every day, earning 2,500 to 3,000 yuan per *ji* (five days), averaging 15,000 yuan per month. Zhang Xi, a woman, spun two *jin* of cotton per *ji*, earning 10,200 yuan per month. In the family's sideline income, textile income was equal to one-half of other income. Li Pianzi weaved cloth day and night, producing five large bolts of cloth (3.2 *zhang* long) every five days. His textile income this spring reached 150,000 yuan. Zhang Lanyi spun and weaved himself, earning 100,000 yuan this spring. Li Fuzhi's family had five spinning wheels and one loom, earning 120,000 yuan this spring. The whole family relied entirely on textiles for their livelihood. Not only did all the women participate in textiles, but also the old men who could not go out to engage in production also spun at home. Li Ronghe, Li Shenghe, Zhang Tianshun, Zhang Xichang, and others, who were all over 50 years old, spun with great enthusiasm, and they spun good thread and wove good cloth. According to statistics for the three and a half months this spring, textile income in the whole village accounted for 49 percent of the total sideline income this spring.

　　Combining the above production income, it reached more than 5.3 million yuan and 18.5 *shi* of grain in the three and a half months this spring. No one starved to death in the whole village, there were no beggars, and spring plowing was completed.

　　Organizing Manpower to Replace Livestock, Completing Spring Plowing and Sowing
　　The village had 2303.3 *mu* of spring land, but only 49 weak livestock. Each animal had to plow an average of 40-50 *mu* of land, which was too much even in a good year. Moreover, this year the livestock were so thin that they "could be blown over by the wind" and "collapsed and couldn't get up." They had to use manpower to replace livestock to complete the spring plowing and sowing tasks.

　　Using manpower to plow and plant the land was an unprecedented event in Da Kong. Not only did strong young men participate in pulling the plow, but also women, old men, and children participated in this movement. Li Jilu's 33 *mu* of land were all planted by people pulling the plow. Zhang Shuzi, Xiao Zhangqun, and Wang Fuzhen formed a group and rushed to plant 50 *mu* this year. Everyone in the village felt that they would starve to death if they could not plant the land, and only hard struggle could overcome the famine.

　　By organizing manpower to replace livestock and overcoming the shortage of animal power in spring plowing, the spring plowing and sowing work was completed. According to statistics at the end of May, 2029.6 *mu* of spring land had been planted with seedlings, 273.7 *mu* had not yet been planted (including those that did not produce seedlings after planting), 1320.1 *mu* had been hoed once, and 417.5 *mu* had been hoed twice.

　　Note: The *shi* mentioned in this material, unless otherwise specified as 市石 (*shi shi*, market *shi*), refers to the local old *dou* (five *dou* is equal to eight *shi dou*).

　　元氏大孔村怎样渡过灾荒完成下种的？
  　灾荒十分严重
    元氏六区大孔村，几年来在蒋伪魏永和匪帮统治掠夺下，大部田园荒芜，同时去年又遭受了严重的旱灾，全村一八五户、八一七人口，去年一个秋季，只收入粮食二九五·六石，而其中被敌人抢走六六·一五石，负担三十石，余下的粮食按全村人口平均，每人只有两斗多。但是实际上还有三八户、一三七人，根本一点粮食也没有打下；一三户、六十六人，每人只平均收入不足一斗粮。当时无论中农贫农及素称有积蓄的家庭，都面临极严重的灾荒。该村村长李连春说：俺村家家户户闹灾荒，去年秋后谁也想不到还能活到现在，谁也想不到能吃上今年的麦子。
  　救灾生产、战胜春荒
    这种历史上罕有的灾荒是被共产党领导下的人民战胜了，大孔村生产委员会在初步总结这次灾荒的成绩和经验中，找到了以下几点：
    一、救灾贷款起了大的作用
    解放后至麦收前半年中，政府发放救济粮二千斤、贷粮七千斤，四次贷款共达二百七十万元（冀钞，下同），还有贷花六三九斤，救济粮四千斤，菜三千斤，得到救济及贷粮款的一百六十户、七六三人，贷款全部扶助纺织及胡扑坎上（挑担贩运等艰苦创业）。如李然吉四口人，今春贷款二万元，参加政府组织的运输生产赚洋一万一千元，又以此三万一千元作本钱生产，除吃还赚洋六千元，后又结合农业生产打纺车赚洋五千余元，他说：“没有这贷款，一亩地也种不上，荒年过不去。”张文祥领了救济粮六十斤，全家三口人，吃了一个月，以后又贷款二千二百元，生产除了吃，还买了五大斗粮食，按上了春苗，他说：“要没有贷粮款，别说种上地，连种籽也没处闹。”李连春四口人，贷粮一百斤，两次贷款三万五千元，他儿子六申，拿贷款运输挣粮食一大斗，他父亲李老合（八十多岁），有了本钱，日夜纺织，一春天赚洋三万多元，他本人在家弹花又赚了两万多元，全家共赚了七万多元，地也都种上了。他说，要不是贷款贷粮，不但地种不上，人也得饿死一些。
  　二、啥有利干啥紧扑坎糊口
    冬春雨季副业生产，对渡过春荒起了决定作用。首先是全村男子动员起来，拿着贷款作本钱，胡扑坎跑生产，全村常跑的扁担达九十余村，小车三十余辆。他们的口号：“啥有利干啥，紧扑坎糊口”，年前大批劳力组织贩运白菜，半夜动身，天明赶到赵县大石桥（距大孔四十里），买下白菜当天又返回元氏城卖了白菜换回粮食，回到家中已是大黄昏时候了，来回路程达一百一十五里。全村参加贩白菜的达一百五十余户，有小车的推有扁担的担，妇女李群、张凤栾等，还参加了扛白菜，一次即扛了三十余斤。六十多岁的李堂子，还推一百五十余斤。王连珍家中二人一车一担，贩白菜共换回七布袋粮食，到年前除全家七人糊口外，还长下一布袋多粮食。李全富只靠一条扁担，到年底换回粮食五布袋（约合四市石）。除贩白菜外，还有贩甘卤的二户，卖豆腐的十一户，卖杂面的、卖烧饼的十余户。只年前一段，全村胡扑坎即赚回粮食达三百市石，解决了冬荒，并为渡春荒打下基础。
    春天继续加紧扑坎，只麦收前的三个半月中，据全村不完全的统计，赚洋一、八二五、五○○元、及粮食十七石五斗，赚的钱按当时市价，能买粮食七一·三大石。
  　三、男女纺织日夜不息
    纺织收入在渡荒中亦起很大作用，在自愿结组的号召下，全村参加纺花组的一二八户、一三个组（主要是共用灯光组），全村三十六张织布机，一百八十七辆纺车，全部转动起来。十二岁的女孩张蓝臣，每天纺市秤半斤花，每个集（五天）能赚洋二千五百元至三千元，一个月平均能赚一万五千元，妇女张喜，每集纺二斤花，一个月就赚洋一万零二百元，在全家的副业收入中，纺织收入等于其他收入的二分之一。李偏子织布日夜不停机，每五天能出五个大布（三·二丈长），今春纺织收入达十五万元。张兰义自纺自织，今春收入十万元，李富枝全家五个纺车，一个织布机，今春收入达十二万元，全家全靠纺织生活。不只是全体妇女参加了纺织，而且不能出外跑生产的老汉也在家纺织起来。李荣合、李生河、张天顺、张喜长等，他们都是五十岁以上的老年人了，纺织的很带劲，而且是纺好线织好布。据今春三个半月时间的统计，全村纺织收入，占今春副业总收入的百分之四十九。
    综合以上各项生产收入，在今春三个半月中，共达五百三十多万元，又粮一八·五石。全村没有饿死一个人，也没有要饭的，并且完成了春耕。
  　组织人力顶牲口、完成了春耕下种
    全村春地二三○三·三亩，只有四九个瘦弱牲口，每个牲口平均耕四五十亩地，即便是好年头也是不胜任的，况且今年牲口瘦的“一风刮倒了”“卧倒起不来”，只好用人力顶牲口来完成春耕下种任务。
    用人力耕地种地，在大孔说来，是空前的大事。不但壮年男子参加了拉地，而且妇女及老头儿童也都参加了这一运动。李记鲁的三十三亩地，都是人拉人种的，张叔子与小张群和王福珍合组，二男今年抢种了五十亩。全村人人都感到种不上地就要饿死，只有艰苦斗争才能战胜灾荒。
    由于组织了人力顶牲口，克服了春耕中的畜力困难，完成了春耕下种工作，至五月底统计，全村已按成苗的春地达二○二九·六亩，未按苗（包括种后没有按成）的二七三·七亩，已进行头锄的一三二○·一亩，进行二锄的四一七·五亩。
    注：该材料中所说的石，除注明是市石外，其余都是指的本地老斗（五斗即合市斗八斗）。
