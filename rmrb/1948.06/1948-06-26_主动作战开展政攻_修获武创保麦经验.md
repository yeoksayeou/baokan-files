[Taihang News] In the Xiu-Huo-Wu County (Xin County, parts of Xiuwu, Huojia, and Wuzhi), an intense struggle for the wheat harvest began on May 20th. After repeatedly defeating the Chiang bandits who were attempting to seize the wheat, the county successfully completed its task of protecting the wheat by early June, and the broad masses of the people safely harvested their wheat. The county's experience in protecting the wheat is as follows: (1) Launching a mass guerrilla war, often using small armed units in conjunction with local work to actively operate and compress the enemy into a narrow area, preventing them from easily venturing out to harass. (2) Frequently taking the initiative to attack, pushing the war into enemy-occupied areas, putting the enemy in a passive and vulnerable position, and preventing them from attacking. On May 27th, Chiang bandit He Xiaoniu's troops, numbering over eighty, conducted a probing operation towards Zhu Yuan Village in Qin South. Our unit quickly outflanked the enemy's rear and, in a ten-minute battle, killed, wounded, and captured a hundred enemy soldiers, thwarting the enemy's plan. Several proactive ambushes also achieved victory, repelling hundreds of enemy soldiers and even their offensives. (3) Launching political offensives to disintegrate the enemy's morale and boost the people's fighting spirit. For example, widely publicizing the news of Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable defeat, our army's recovery of cities, and our army's lenient policies towards prisoners of war have all played a significant role. Captured soldiers said, "We just hope to become prisoners of war; as prisoners of war, we can eat our fill." "We have long known about the lenient policy. We have seen that those captured have all been released. But the officers don't allow us to say it; whoever says it will be punished." (4) Organizing mass intelligence gathering to grasp the enemy's patterns of action, understand the enemy's personnel and weapon configuration, and know the time, location, and plans of their actions, ensuring that we win every battle. (5) Conducting explosions and laying mines everywhere, making the enemy fearful everywhere and seeing enemies everywhere. (Editor's Note: We should also carry forward the experience of the Anti-Japanese War and unite all neutral and potentially neutral people to fight against the enemy.)

　　主动作战开展政攻
  　修获武创保麦经验
    【太行讯】修获武县（薪县，修武、获嘉、武陟各一部）从五月二十日展开紧张的麦收斗争，多次击败抢麦蒋匪，迄六月上旬，胜利完成保麦任务，广大群众都平安的收了麦子。该县保麦的经验是：（一）开展群众游击战争，经常以小股武装结合地方工作，积极活动，把敌人压缩于狭小圈内，使其不得轻易出扰。（二）时常主动出击，使战争推向敌占地区，使敌经常陷于被动挨打地位，不能进攻。五月二十七日，蒋匪何小牛部八十余人向沁南朱原村进行试探性活动，我某部即很快迂回到敌人后方，以十分钟战斗毙伤俘敌百人，粉碎了敌人的计划。具有几次主动的伏击也都取得胜利，打退敌数百人甚至敌人的出犯。（三）开展政治进攻，瓦解敌人军心士气，提高群众的斗志。如广泛宣传蒋介石必败，我军收复城市等胜利消息及我军对俘虏的宽大政策等，都起了不少作用。被俘士兵说：“我们就盼当俘虏，当了俘虏吃饱饭。”“我们早就知道宽大政策。眼看被俘的都放回来了。但当官的不让说，谁说就扣谁。”（四）组织群众性的情报，掌握敌人行动规律，了解敌之人员武器配备，及行动的时间地点与计划，保证自己每战必胜。（五）开展爆炸，到处埋雷，使敌处处害怕，草木皆兵。（编者按：还应发扬抗日时期的经验，团结一切中立的及可能中立的人们一致对敌。）
