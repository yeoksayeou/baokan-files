Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: A certain leather factory in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Allied Defense Area advocates the combination of physical and mental labor. Technicians and workers have organized a technical research association, which has greatly improved production quantity and quality and reduced costs. This technical research association was formed in March this year. After more than a month of experimentation, by the end of April, the output of the leather production unit for cattle hide alone had increased by 70% compared to February, the completed unit output increased by 236%, and costs were reduced by at least 20%. The products are more durable than before.

　　This technical research association has established technical research groups for soaking hides, sewing, cutting, and stitching, according to different production units. Meetings are held every half month. The groups study product quality, quantity, and improvement methods. Then the factory management convenes a technical research meeting of the group leaders, adopting the suggestions of the staff and workers based on possible conditions, and provides them with experimental materials and time. For example, before March, the soaking group of the leather production unit always found that the cowhides soaked in acid water were brittle and not durable. Worker Huang Zhenrong believed that this was due to the acid water being too concentrated. The technical research association provided him with materials and encouraged him to experiment. As a result, Huang Zhenrong not only determined the appropriate proportion of acid water components, saving materials, but also reduced the acid soaking time for each cowhide from 20 minutes to 15 minutes, producing hides that were resilient and met the factory's standards.

　　The sewing group extracted ointment from green apricot bark. After repeated research, they found that the more finely the bark was ground, the more ointment could be extracted, which greatly increased the ointment production from then on. Another example is the stitching group of the finishing unit. After discussion by the research group, they believed that too many stitches damaged the leather and made it less durable. After testing, everyone decided that the number of stitches per inch should not exceed four and a half for artillery shell covers and gun covers, and six and a half for bullet pouches, which not only shortened the production process but also made the finished product strong and durable. The cutting research group discussed changing to a contract system, and after comparing progress over time, it has stimulated a competition to save raw materials. In the past, the finishing unit had the group leader inspect the finished products, but now it has been changed to a system of collective inspection by the group.

　　The leadership's attention to leveraging the wisdom of the masses to improve technology has been well received by all employees. They said, "In our own factory, our workers are not just laborers, but also technicians who use their brains."

　　西北某制革厂创造生产新方式
    提倡体力智力结合
  　产品数量质量提高
    【新华社西北二十九日电】陕甘宁晋绥联防军区某制革厂，提倡体力劳动与智力劳动结合，由技师工人组织技术研究会，因此大大提高了生产数量和质量，并减低了成本。此一技术研究会于今春三月组成，经过月余实验，到四月份止，制革股产量仅牛皮一项，较二月份提高了百分之七十，完成股产量则提高了百分之二百三十六，成本至少减低百分之廿，出品较前结实耐用。该技术研究会根据各个不同的生产单位，成立了浸皮、缝制、裁件、缝件等技术研究小组，每半月召开一次，小组会研究产品的质量数量和改进方法，然后由厂部召集各个小组长举行技术研究会，根据可能条件采纳职工的建议，并给以试验的材料和时间。如制革股浸皮组在三月份前用酸水浸出的牛皮总是脆而不耐，工人黄振荣认为系酸水过浓所致，经技术研究会给以材料，鼓励他试验，结果黄振荣不但得出酸水成份的适当比例，节省了材料，而且将每张牛皮的浸酸时间由二十分钟缩减至十五分钟，制出之富有韧性合乎厂部标准。缝制组从青杏树皮中提炼丹药膏，经再三研究，得出树皮碾得愈碎提炼愈多的规律，使丹药膏产量从此大大增加。又如完成股之缝件组，经研究小组讨论，认为针数过密，皮子上针眼太多，使皮子受损不耐；试验结果，大家决定炮衣枪衣每英寸不超过四针半，子弹袋不超过六针半，不但缩短了制作过程，又使成品结实耐用。裁件组研究小组讨论改成包工形式，按期进行比较后，已引起大家节省原料的竞赛。完成股过去系由组长检验成品，现在已改变为小组集体检验的制度。领导上注意发挥群众智慧改进技术，在全体职工中得到良好反映，他们说：“在咱们自己的工厂里，咱们工人不光是出劳力的工人，而且是动脑子的技师。”
