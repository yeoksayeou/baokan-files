Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—The People's Liberation Army's capture of Kaifeng City, the capital of Henan Province, has caused panic within the petty court in Nanjing. The puppet president, Chiang Kai-shek, flew over Kaifeng on the 21st for inspection, landed in Zhengzhou, and immediately convened a military conference. On the 22nd, he flew to Xi'an, the old nest of Hu Zongnan's army. As the powerful People's Liberation Army attacked Kaifeng, the Nanjing puppet government exhibited panic, chaos, complaints, and disintegration. On the 19th, puppet legislators and supervisory committee members from Henan formed a "delegation" to petition Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang's Chief of General Staff, Gu Zhutong, demanding that "large forces be sent to reinforce Kaifeng." "Dai Liwen even knelt before Gu Zhutong" (Reuters). The Associated Press reported that on the 21st, the "Henan delegation" held an unprecedented seven-hour sit-down strike at Chiang Kai-shek's official residence, demanding that Chiang personally go to Henan to direct the defense of Kaifeng. ... They only left at 1 a.m. when they saw that there would be no good result. On the 22nd, upon hearing that the Liberation Army had captured Kaifeng, "indignant 'Henan representatives' declared that if Chiang Kai-shek could not fulfill his promise, he would be rebuked." At the same time, the puppet Legislative Yuan passed a temporary resolution on the same day to "review the reasons for the defeat in the Central Plains War." The proposer, Zheng Zhenyu, a CC Clique puppet legislator, criticized Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and incompetent strategic guidance in his speech, saying: "The Kaifeng battle was due to erroneous prior judgment, ineffective temporary dispatch, and local unit commanders being unable to command above the regiment level, requiring direct command from the central government (referring to Chiang Kai-shek). ... We should thoroughly review this" (Central News Agency). An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing stated that the "friends" of puppet Vice President Li Zongren complained that "Mr. Li was 'not busy' during the 'President's' (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) absence from Nanjing." This complaint confirms the widespread rumors of contradictions between the puppet president and the puppet vice president, namely that Chiang Kai-shek not only does not allow Li Zongren to share dictatorial power, but also strictly restricts his freedom of speech and action.

　　我军解放开封引起巨大震动
  　南京小朝廷一片慌乱
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】人民解放军之攻克河南省会开封城，已引起南京小朝廷一片慌乱。伪总统蒋介石于二十一日飞赴开封上空视察、随在郑州登陆，并立即召开军事会议，并于二十二日飞抵胡宗南军老巢西安。当强大的人民解放军进攻开封时，南京伪政府内部活现出惊慌、混乱、埋怨和分崩离析。十九日河南籍伪立委、监委会组成“代表团”向蒋介石及蒋军参谋总长顾祝同请愿，要求“派大军增援开封”，“戴立瘟曾跪在顾祝词的面前”（路透社）。合众社称：二十一日“河南省代表团”在蒋介石官邱中举行了前所未见的七小时的静坐罢工，要求蒋亲赴河南指挥开封的防御。…………他们在夜晚一时看出不会有好结果时，方才离开。二十二日当听到解放军打下开封时，“愤激的‘河南代表’声言，若蒋介石不能实践诺言，则将加以斥责”。与此同时，伪立法院于同日通过了“检讨中原战争失利原因”的临时决议，提案人ＣＣ派伪立委郑震宇在发言中指责蒋介石独裁无能的战略指导说：“开封战事，由于事前判断错误，临时调度无方，而地方部队长官不能指挥在团以上均须中央（按指蒋介石）直接指挥。………吾人应彻底检讨”（中央社）。美联社的南京电讯则说：伪副总统李宗仁的“友人”埋怨说：“李氏在‘总统’（按指蒋介石）离宁期间‘并不忙碌一些’”。这一埋怨证实了盛传的伪总统与伪副总统的矛盾，即蒋介石不但不给李宗仁分享独裁权，并严格限制其言论行动权。
