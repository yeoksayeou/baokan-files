　　【Taihang News】The Heshun First District Work Group, in order to clarify the thoughts of cadres, overcome the undisciplined and anarchic state in some villages, establish a correct democratic order, and carry out agricultural and sideline production, convened a village cadre meeting on the 5th of this month. Present were 298 people, including CCP village branch secretaries, village chiefs, peasant association chairmen, women's federation chairwomen, militia committee directors, instructors, cooperative chairmen, labor heroes, various model workers, and primary school teachers. The work involved explaining the instructions of the Taihang District Party Committee Secretariat and cadres. Then, using base points as units, and with a spirit of self-criticism and mutual criticism, the participants collectively examined various confused thoughts. The following are the types of thinking that were initially corrected:

　　(1) Some cadre Party members still had misunderstandings about the Party rectification policy. For example, the Xiyao branch secretary said: "Party rectification means replacing old people with new people. Cadres with a long work history and active struggle have big mistakes; old good people who didn't work in the past and didn't offend anyone have small mistakes, and the masses support them." In the general discussion, many village cadres in Dongguan who were rectifying the Party used their personal experiences to break this misunderstanding. Peasant Representative Conference Chairman Li Sibao said: "I have been a cadre for seven or eight years, and I am a responsible cadre (peasant association chairman). I made a self-examination and review, and I am still a cadre. The masses have elected me as the chairman of the Peasant Representative Conference." The Dongguan Village Political Director said: "In the past, Li Shahai of Dongguan was a political director, peasant association chairman, and deputy village chief. He was a good old person, didn't offend anyone, and didn't do any work. This time the masses didn't elect him as a cadre."

　　(2) Some cadres and Party members were afraid of retaliation from people who had been wrongly labeled as special agents and middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against. Cadres in Qingyangshu said: "After class division, we dare not raise our heads when we see middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, for fear that they will retaliate when we join the Party." After a full discussion, everyone gradually realized the harm of harming middle peasants to the revolution. The leadership also introduced the economy of the experimental village, explaining that the main responsibility for the past wrongful struggles against middle peasants lay with the leadership because there were no clear standards for class division at that time. If the leadership examines its mistakes, the wrongly struggled households will unite with the new and old cadres and all the peasants. For example, Jun Erzhu of Dongguan was a wrongly struggled household. After compensation, he became the cooperative accountant and worked very actively.

　　(3) Some cadres were afraid of being unruly with formerly expelled party members, dismissed cadres, ruffians, and unsavory people, who do not listen to reason. Fengtai Branch Secretary Bai Fusheng said: "In our village, twenty people who participated in the war forced village cadres to give them travel expenses and forcibly borrowed 60,000 yuan of shares from the women's cooperative. We said it wasn't appropriate and that we had to discuss it with the women. They immediately said that the cadres were ruling the masses again and that it wasn't democratic." Baiquan Branch Secretary said: "With democracy, people gamble and the cadres don't dare to interfere. When it's their turn to participate in the war, they also say that democracy is not being implemented. They come to meetings when they want to, and leave when they want to." (Except for legally mandated compulsory meetings, the masses should have the right to come and go as they please - Editor). Based on everyone's opinions, the work group explained what true democracy is, and cadres and party members in the experimental village introduced their experiences in implementing democracy and refuting retaliatory opinions, mobilizing everyone to discuss. Finally, the leadership concentrated everyone's opinions and made it clear that democracy is about upholding the truth, adhering to principles, and safeguarding the long-term interests of the majority of the people. For all kinds of incorrect opinions and phenomena that violate laws and decrees, the masses must be mobilized to supervise, educate, and correct them. Those who repeatedly violate the law and do not change must be handed over to the government for handling according to law. In the future, all kinds of work must still be studied by the branch and discussed by the masses. If it is appropriate, it will be implemented; if it is not appropriate, it will be revised. If the masses' opinions are incorrect, the masses can be educated and persuaded to act according to policy (After "branch research", this is not a statutory procedure for the masses, nor is it an obligation. The masses have the right to deal with their own problems directly regardless of the branch, and can request that the branch not hold secret meetings. Cadres can persuade the masses regarding their opinions, but if they cannot persuade them, they should, in addition to declaring a reservation on principle, also obey organizationally. That is, the minority submits to the majority - Editor).

　　After the ideological problems of the cadres and Party members in each village were resolved, they requested the higher authorities to assign work. On the morning of the 7th, the work team put forward production tasks, separated base points for discussion, and formulated plans independently. Finally, the work team, based on everyone's opinions, gathered together again and made unified arrangements for production. All Party members and cadres were filled with confidence in victory and successfully closed the meeting. (Heshun Joint Office)

　　和顺一区村干开会澄清思想
  　建立民主秩序开展生产
    【太行讯】和顺一区工作组，为了澄清干部思想，克服村里某些无纪律、无政府状态，建立正确的民主秩序，开展农副业生产。于本月五日召开村干部会议，到有中共村支部书记、村长、农会主席、妇女主席、武委会主任、指导员、合作社长、劳动英雄、各种模范、小学教员等二百九十八人。工作是在会上讲解了太行区党委书记处、干部、各秘书，接着以基点为单位，用自我批评、互相批评的精神，集体检查各种糊涂思想。总结起来有以下几种思想得到初步纠正：
    （一）有些干部党员对整党政策还有误解，如细窑支书说：“整党是旧人换新人，工作历史长，斗争积极的干部都错误大；过去不工作、不得罪人的老好人错误小，群众拥护”。在大会讨论中，东关不少整理党的村干部用自己亲身的经历，打破了这种误解。农代会主席李四保说：“我当了七八年干部，也是负责干部（农会主席），我做了反省检查，现在还是干部，群众又选我当农代会主席”。东关村政治主任说：“过去东关的李啥孩，当过政治主任，农会主席兼副村长，他倒是好人主义，不得罪人，也不做工作，这次群众就没选他当干部”。
    （二）有些干部、党员怕摘了特务帽的人和错斗中农报复。青杨树干部说：“经过划成份，咱见了错斗中农不敢抬头，怕人在入党时报复”。经过充分的讨论，大家逐渐认识了伤害中农对革命的害处，领导上又把实验村的经济做了介绍，说明过去错斗中农主要责任是由领导负，因为那时没有明确划阶级的标准。领导上检查了错误，错斗户就会和新旧干部及全体农民团结起来，如东关军二珠年，是错斗户，经过补偿，又当了合作社会计，工作很积极。
    （三）有些干部怕过去被开除的党员、撤职的干部、流氓“二杆子”和不正派的人胡闹，不讲理。风台支书白福生说：“俺村二十个参战的群众，逼住村干部要路费，强迫借妇女合作社的六万元股金。咱说不合适，得和妇女商量，人家马上说又是干部统治群众，说是不民主”。白泉支书说：“实行民主了，人家赌钱，干部不敢管。该人家去参战，人家也说是不实行民主。开会想来就来，想走就走”。（除法定的义务会议外，群众应有想来就来，想走就走之权——编者）工作组根据大家的意见，讲解什么叫真民主，实验村干部党员又介绍了实行民主、批驳报复意见的经验，发动大家讨论。最后领导上集中大家意见，明确指出民主是坚持真理，坚持原则，保障大多数人民的长远利益，对于各种不正确意见，和违犯法令的现象，要发动群众起来监督、教育和纠正。屡次犯法不改者得送交政府依法办理。以后各种工作还是要经过支部研究，群众讨论，合适就执行，不合适就修改，如果群众意见不正确，可以教育说服群众按政策办事，（经“支部研究”，对群众来说，并不是法定手续，也无此义务，群众有权利不管支部直接处理他们自己的问题，并可要求支部不开秘密会议。干部对于他们认为的群众错误意见，可以说服，但说不服时，他除可声明原则上的保留外，还应在组织上服从。即少数服从多数。——编者）
    各村干部党员思想问题得到解决后，即要求上级布置工作。七号早上，工作团提出生产任务，分开基点讨论，自订计划。最后，工作团又根据大家意见，集中起来，对生产做了统一布置，全体党员干部满怀胜利信心，圆满闭会。（和顺联合办公室）
