North Yue News: According to incomplete reports from Guangling, Shuyu, Yu County, Pingding, Hunyuan, Wutai and other counties in the North Yue area: the distribution of agricultural loans has played a huge role in promoting and assisting the production endeavors of the masses. Last spring, Guangling's Second District suffered from bandit looting and drought, leaving over 10,000 mu of land barren. This spring, the government allocated loan grain, coupled with the victory of the North Line campaign, greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the masses. Under the slogan of "eliminate mature wasteland," the entire district has eliminated 9,000 mu of mature wasteland. Liangzhuang only has 6,400 mu of land, and 3,270 mu were barren last spring. This spring, the government distributed 2,460 jin of loan grain and 2 million (border currency, same below) in funds. The masses were extremely excited and bought 16 head of draft animals, eliminating 2,970 mu of mature wasteland. In the Third District, eleven villages including Haizi and Shenshugou were hit by a severe hailstorm last autumn, resulting in almost no harvest on about 15,000 mu of land. The masses were all clamoring to "go to the mouth" (to areas outside the pass). After the distribution of agricultural loans, the masses in three villages of Nangeya bought 14 new draft animals, organized work teams, and completed plowing and sowing on schedule. The villagers said gratefully: "If it weren't for the Communist Party leading us this year, not to mention farming, it would be difficult to even protect our lives!" A large number of people in the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Districts of Shuyu fled to the interior of the liberated areas to make a living due to the devastation caused by Yan's bandits. They lacked food and clothing and lived in extreme poverty. This spring, the government made this area the focus of agricultural loan distribution, allocating 83,160 jin of rice for agriculture and organizing 3,076 people to cultivate wasteland. Preliminary statistics show that 2,837 mu of raw wasteland have been reclaimed. In addition, the masses used agricultural loans to buy 24 head of draft animals and 60 pieces of farm tools such as hoes and shovels, laying the foundation for next year's production. In terms of sideline production, 14,300 jin of rice were allocated to manufacture 600 new spinning wheels, and 800 jin of cotton were used as capital to organize 876 women to spin thread. Each four liang of thread spun earned one jin of rice, which could support about 1,000 people. Another 96 people were organized to engage in small handicraft industries such as carpentry, basket weaving, leather making, shoe nailing, and cigarette rolling. Seventeen carpenters alone profited 400,000 each in half a month by making grenade handles. Another 23,400 jin of rice were used to organize 876 people to engage in street vending, transportation, and sales. Twenty-two people in Fancun who engaged in transportation and sales profited 8 million in half a month, with a net profit of 6 million after deducting food, drink, and travel expenses. Under such organized assistance, all but four layabouts among the original 110 refugees who lived by begging found legitimate means of livelihood. Zhang Yousheng, a poor peasant in Xiwancun, Yu County, and two others borrowed eight dou of grain and drove two donkeys to engage in transportation and sales. From April to the present, they have profited 1.5 million. In order not to delay the farming season, they also found Ren Chunlin and another person, and the five of them worked together. Three people drove two donkeys to engage in transportation and sales, and the profits were shared equally. The other two drove two donkeys at home to contract to cultivate the land and perform corvée labor for five households, achieving a balance between agriculture, sideline production, and war support. After the poor peasants in the four villages of Xihe, Duanjiazhuang, Hongshanya, and Shuiquanwan in Wutai County were allocated land, they lacked seeds and fertilizer. This spring, the government allocated 7 million; organized 19 people to engage in transportation and sales, earning 1.3 million; subsidized six people to burn asphalt, earning 360,000; three women made shoes and earned 210,000; and two people wove baskets and earned 410,000. The production difficulties of the masses were thus resolved.
