Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Foreign news agencies report that the patriotic movement protesting the U.S. policy of supporting Japan has spread to Guangzhou in South China. More than 2,800 students from Sun Yat-sen University issued a joint statement on the 11th of this month, opposing the U.S. policy of supporting Japan and endangering China. The Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association, composed of six major industrial groups (according to the French Press Agency's English manuscript translation), will hold a meeting in Hong Kong on the 19th of this month to protest the dumping of Japanese goods in Hong Kong caused by the U.S. policy of raising Japan's industrial level. The holding of this meeting has been approved by the British authorities. In other news, following the patriotic parade and demonstration in Peiping on the 9th of this month, several thousand students from several universities in Peiping and Tianjin held a joint general strike for two days to oppose the U.S. support of Japan. Furthermore, the Peking University Student Self-Government Association in Peiping City publicly displayed a public opinion survey box on the U.S. policy toward Japan from May 25th, not only soliciting opinions from students but also soliciting opinions from the citizens of Peiping who had been brutally ruled by the enemy and puppets for eight years. More than 800 students from the university held a symposium on the Japanese issue on May 27th to discuss the reasons for U.S. imperialism's support of Japanese aggressive forces and its impact on China, the Far East, and the world. The students were enthusiastic in their speeches.
