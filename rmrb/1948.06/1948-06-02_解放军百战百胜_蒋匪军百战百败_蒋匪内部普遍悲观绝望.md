Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- According to news published in Chiang-controlled newspapers: On April 22nd in Nanjing, the "Pseudo-National Assembly" passed a so-called "Clarify National Policy and Save the Critical Situation" proposal, submitted by 855 pseudo-National Assembly representatives, which even the Central News Agency admitted showed a "thorough understanding." This fully exposed the widespread pessimism and despair within the Kuomintang reactionary camp due to the deepening military crisis. Although the proposal repeats its anti-communist rhetoric, referring to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army as "bandits" and the liberated areas as "bandit areas" (for example, falsely accusing the CCP's land reform policy of "buying off the poor" and the PLA's prisoner policy of "deception"), and attempts to use various methods to create opposition between the masses in enemy-occupied areas and us, in order to prolong their collapse; in its analysis of the situation, it cannot help but admit the following three basic facts:

First, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, in the people's revolutionary war, are supported by the people across the country, while the Kuomintang bandit gang, which is carrying out a counter-revolutionary war, is opposed by the people across the country and has fallen into complete isolation. The proposal states: "In the bandit areas, 70 percent of the poor are willing to die for them; looking at our areas (referring to Chiang-controlled areas, the same below), 70 percent of the poor are bewitched by the bandits and hope that the communist bandits will come soon so they can share the benefits. And 30 percent of the rich, the cunning ones first collude with the bandits, planning to atone for their sins, the cowardly ones are greedy for money and afraid of death, keeping silent and folding their hands. Who is willing to ruin their families to relieve the country's difficulties and take up arms to advance! What is even more frightening is that communist bandits can turn captured officers and soldiers back to the battlefield to fight for them after a few deceptions; it is not only difficult to win over Kuomintang soldiers captured by communist bandits, but also worry that they have pre-planned conspiracies and dare not use them. Therefore, the path of using prisoners has become a smooth road for the bandits, and a rugged one for us. Therefore, in terms of using the people, the bandits have 100 percent in the bandit areas and 70 percent in our areas. Combined, the masses used by the bandits to create chaos (falsely referring to the people's revolutionary war) reach 170 percent. We have no one in the bandit areas, and few even in our areas. Combined, the people supporting our suppression of the rebellion (counter-revolutionary war) are almost zero, virtually fighting against something with nothing."

Second, the People's Liberation Army wins every battle, while the Kuomintang bandit army loses every battle. The original text states: "At the beginning of the Communist Party's creation of chaos, they started from scratch, initially without armed forces to resist the government troops. The government is like a boat, and the people are like water. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. This is an ancient proverb. The Communist Party, therefore, uses military means to seize power, using the method of boats bumping into each other, and uses the people to subvert the government, using the method of water capsizing the boat. The communist bandits can make the people fall into their grasp, creating a red sea, with everyone acting as spies for them, communicating information. Our actions are clear to the bandits. The bandits come and go, but we are completely unaware. We do not know the bandits, but the bandits know us; the bandits' eyes are in the sky, shining a thousand miles, while we are both blind, unable to see even nearby. The bandits run when they see a large enemy and fight when they see a small enemy. When the bandit army attacks us, they hit accurately every time. When we attack the bandit army, we miss every time. Their battles have only victories and no defeats. They seize guns and ammunition, becoming increasingly rampant. We are in danger if we are stationed in the countryside and trapped if we gather in the cities, forming a situation where our troops are wounded and killed every day, and our areas suffer losses everywhere. In fact, the countryside has become the bandits' warehouse and the source of soldiers. Well-equipped and excellent army corps objectively become the bandits' weapons transport troops. The bandits have boats to bump into each other in the water that capsizes the boat. Thus, they advance from occupying small strongholds to medium strongholds to large strongholds. Today, they have sufficient guns and ammunition, and they should have everything from large siege cannons. Our provincial capitals and cities are greatly threatened. Even if the national army receives American aid weapons, using them in strongholds will result in their loss with the loss of the strongholds. Using them in combat will result in their loss with the sacrifice of the troops. At most, only half is used to suppress the bandits, while the other half falls into the hands of the bandits. The bandits can continue to realize their so-called replenishment on the front line, and their weapons are inexhaustible."

Third, no amount of American aid can save the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from death. The original text states: "In terms of the situation, the communist bandits have no shortage of people, money, guns, and ammunition. They can advance from point to line, and from line to surface; the national army advances from surface to line, and from line to point. It is as if the communist bandits are like water, and the country (Chiang's bandits) is like a boat. The boat is in a storm, and the water can capsize the boat. What can the boat do to the water? If this continues, the country will have neither people to govern nor soldiers to hold weapons. In terms of momentum, they are winning, and we are failing. Those who hope that armed (referring to the military force of American imperialism) aid to China can reverse the situation are fantasizing, judging from past events. During the Anti-Japanese War, our army implemented a full-scale national war of resistance (Note: What the Kuomintang implemented during the Anti-Japanese War was only a policy of passive resistance and active anti-communism; only the Communist Party truly led the full-scale war of resistance). The Japanese army was deeply mired in a quagmire. The Japanese army in North China never dared to cross the Yellow River and attack westward, not because they were cowardly but because they were worried about what was behind them (that is, not afraid of the Chiang Kai-shek troops who fled at the first sign of trouble, but afraid of the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army, which persisted in resisting Japan behind enemy lines). At that time, the guerrilla forces (Eighth Route Army) in Jin Province were only 100,000, but they could keep 300,000 Japanese troops busy maintaining points and lines, preventing them from attacking Chang'an to the west. Comparing the past with the present, the communist bandits now have a million guerrillas. Even if the Japanese army, which was so strong, came with another three million troops, they would only sink deeper and deeper into the mud. They would not be able to maintain the points and lines for long. Now, whether we can hope for armed aid to China is questionable; even if it is possible, it is clear that it cannot alleviate the critical situation."

　　解放军百战百胜　蒋匪军百战百败
  　蒋匪内部普遍悲观绝望
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据蒋区报纸刊布消息：四月二十二日南京，“伪国大”会上，通过所谓“明确国是，挽救危局”一案，由伪国大代表八五五人签名提出者，中央社亦承认其“认识透彻”。其中充分暴露出国民党反动营垒内部，因军事危机的日益加深，已感到普遍悲观绝望。该案虽然重复其反共滥调，称共产党和人民解放军为“匪”，称解放区为“匪区”（例如将中共土地改革政策诬为“收买穷人”，将解放军俘虏政策诬为“迷惑”政策等），并企图用各种方法造成敌占区群众与我对立，以苟延其崩溃的局面；但在其分析形势部分中，却不能不承认下列三项基本的事实：
    第一、中国共产党和人民解放军在人民革命战争中，受到全国人民拥护和支持，而进行反革命战争的国民党匪帮，则遭受全国人民反对，陷于完全孤立。该案称：“在匪区百分之七十的穷人甘于效死；反观我区（指蒋区，下同），百分之七十穷人受匪蛊惑，日盼共匪早来，得以分甘沾惠。而百分之三十富人，狡者先与匪通，预图赎罪，懦者贪财惜命，噤口束手。谁肯毁家纾难，执戈前驱！尤可怕者，共匪俘虏官兵，几度迷惑，即能转上战场，替匪拼命；国军俘虏共匪员兵，非唯争取困难，且虑其预有阴谋，不敢使用，是用俘虏之途径，成为匪之坦途，而为我崎岖。故就用民言，匪在匪区有百分之百，在我区有百分之七十。合并计之，匪用以造乱（诬指人民革命战争）之群众达二百分之一百七十。我在匪区因无一人，即在我区亦属无几，合并计之，我之戡乱（反革命战争）人民几等于零，实同以无抗有。”
    第二、人民解放军百战百胜，而国民党匪军则百战百败。原文称：“共党造乱之始，徒手起家，初无武装对抗政府军队，政府如舟，人民似水，水能载舟，亦能覆舟，古有明训。共党因之通过军事夺取政权，乃以舟碰舟之手段，以民众颠覆政府，乃以水覆舟之方法。共匪能使人民尽入掌握，造成赤海，人人为其作间谍，通情报，我方行动匪方了如指掌。匪方出没，我方则茫然不明，我不知匪，匪独知我；匪眼立天，烛照千里，我成双瞽，盲速咫尺。匪见大敌来则跑，小敌来则打。匪军攻我，一打一准，我攻匪军，百打百空，彼之作战有胜无败，掳枪获弹，日益猖獗。我分驻乡村则危，聚守城市则困，形成我军日日伤亡，我区乡乡损失，事实上乡村已成共匪之仓库及士兵之补充所在。大好优良装备之兵团，客观上居然等于共匪之武器输送部队，匪在覆舟之水中更有碰舟之舟，于是由攻占小据点而中据点而大据点。时至今日，枪弹充足，攻城大炮彼亦应有尽有，而我之省会都市大受威胁，纵使国军获得援华美械，用之于据点则随据点之失而俱失，用之于作战则随部队之牺牲而损失，充其量用于剿匪者仅得一半，而陷于资匪者又是一半。是匪能继续不断实现其所谓前几补给，其武器不可胜用。”
    第三、任何美国援助，亦不能挽救蒋介石匪帮的死亡。原文称：“就形势言，共匪有人、财、枪械弹药三不缺，能由点而线，由线而面；国军由面而线，由线而点；恰如共匪似水，国家（蒋匪）若舟，舟在惊涛骇浪之中，水可覆舟，舟奈水何？长此以往，将使国家既无民可施，武器亦无兵可持。在势头上，彼胜而我绌，或有望武力（指美帝武力）援华即可扭转形势者，证诸往事，亦属幻想。抗战时期，我军实行全面民族战争（按：抗战中国民党所实行者，只是消极抗战和积极反共政策；真正领导实行全面抗战者，只有共产党），日军正指深陷泥海，华北日军终不敢越黄河而西犯，非胆前乃顾后也（即不是怕前面望风而逃的蒋介石军队，而是怕在敌后坚持抗战的共产党八路军）。时晋境游击部队（八路军）不过十万，能使日军三十万人穷于保持点线，不敢西攻长安。以昔喻今，共匪现有游击队已达百万，假使如日军之强者，再来三百万之众，仍不过愈陷愈深，愈陷泥泞。欲保持点线，亦不能久。今我希望武力援华，能与不能固属疑问；纵属可能，其不能轻危局甚明。”
