　　County and District Cadres Personally Lead
  　A Large Part of Quyang's Wasteland is Sown
    [North Yue News] Quyang has launched a campaign to plant and investigate wasteland. On the first day of the fifth lunar month, Quyang experienced a thorough rain. County-level agencies immediately convened an emergency meeting, determining that May 1st to 8th would be a "shock week" for sowing and wasteland investigation. All county and district cadres would cease all other work to participate in leading this campaign. The county organized two shock teams, led by County Head Zhao and Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Comrade Li Qing, to separately lead the shock in the severely affected second and fifth districts. As of now, thirteen villages in these two districts have identified 3,061 mu of wasteland, and are immediately urging local broadcasters to sow seeds. For those with difficulties, the government is helping to resolve the issues and mobilizing the masses to help each other. Seventy households in Wendecun lacked seeds and have temporarily borrowed some fruit seeds. Thirteen poor and widowed households in Lijiama Village have solved the difficulties of planting by utilizing relationships with relatives and friends and by allocating labor in exchange for work. Most of this wasteland has now been planted. The land of the families of revolutionary martyrs who fought against Japan has been "planted first" in most villages. In the Dangcheng District of the sixth district, sixteen villages, with 307 households under substitute cultivation, and 1,338 mu of land under substitute cultivation, have all been planted. Farmers in Jianzi Village with livestock have automatically helped poor households without labor to sow seeds and will return the labor later. Twenty-three poor peasant households in Hueling Village had no food, and each household borrowed two dou of fruit grain. Farmers in many villages have spontaneously organized temporary labor exchange groups. In the Dangcheng District of the sixth district, sixteen villages have organized 223 labor exchange groups, totaling 679 people, exchanging labor for 2,091 workdays during sowing. (Editor's note: It is worth checking whether these labor exchange groups are voluntarily formed or forcibly formed. The leadership should not be satisfied with these figures.) Women and children in various villages actively participated in the sowing work. In Lijiama Village, out of 35 young women, 24 participated in pulling plows. Sun Lianfu, a poor peasant in Nanjiazhuang, over sixty years old, also went to the fields to add seeds. While working, she instructed, "Sow thickly, it is easy to buy seeds but hard to get seedlings." Tian Dongqin, a poor peasant woman from Dongxiwanzi, plowed and sowed fourteen mu of land herself. The peasants supervised and helped the landlords and rich peasants with their production, and forced those who could work but did not to labor. Those with actual difficulties were helped to solve them. For example, the peasants of Fazicun called on the landlords who lacked labor to use livestock, and the landlords used hay to pay for the labor after the autumn harvest. The landlords in Lingshan had no food and could not produce, so the peasants lent each of them two dou. Under the supervision and help of the peasants, most of the landlords participated in labor, and their land was also sown.

　　县区干部亲自领导
  　曲阳大部荒地下种
    【北岳讯】曲阳展开种查荒运动。阴历五月一日，曲阳普降透雨，县级各机关立即召开紧急会议，确定五月一日至八日为播种查荒突击周，全体县区干部停止一切工作，参加领导这一运动。县里组织两个突击队，由赵县长及县委副书记李清同志带领，分头到灾荒重的二、五区领导突击。截至目前，这两个区的十三个村已查出荒地三千零六十一亩，马上督促本主播种，有困难者政府帮助解决并发动群众互助互济。文德村七十余户缺少种子，暂时借给一部果实。刘家马村十三户贫苦孤寡，利用亲友关系及拨工换工，解决了种地困难。现在这些荒地已大部种上。抗干烈属的土地，大部村都作到“种到头里”。六区党城小区十六个村、受代耕的三百零七户、代耕土地一千三百三十八亩、均已全部种上。涧滋村有牲口的农民，自动帮助贫苦无劳动力的户播种后既定以后还工。灰岭村二十三户贫农没吃的，每户借了果实粮二斗。许多村农民自动组织了临时性的拨工组，六区党城小区、十六个村，组织起二百二十三个变工组、共六百七十九人，播种时变工二千零九十一个。灵山、郭家庄两村变工组变工二千六百一十工。（编者按：这些变工组是自愿组成还是强迫组成，值得进行检查，领导上不应满足这些数目字。）各村妇女儿童积极参加了播种工作。刘家马全村青妇三十五人，即有二十四人参加拉耧拉耠子。南家庄贫农孙连富六十多岁的老母亲，亦到地里添籽，她一面作活，一面嘱咐着：“种稠点，籽种好买苗难得。”东西湾子贫农妇女田东琴，自己拉耧种地达十四亩。对于地主富农的生产，农民们进行了督促和帮助，对能动不动的则强制其劳动。有实际困难的则帮助解决。如法滋村农民叫缺乏劳动力的地主使牲口，秋后地主用谷草还工。灵山地主没吃的不能生产，农民借给他们每家二斗。在农民督促帮助下，大部分地主参加了劳动，土地也都播了种。
