Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 31st: TASS, Moscow: "Labor Daily," in an article entitled "America and Britain," details the acute struggle currently existing between the US and Britain. The article states that American political writings say: "The British Empire may collapse faster than the United States can fill this vacuum," and the United States is anxious about this issue. In other words, the United States fears that the legacy of the British Empire will escape its grasp. The article recalls that American monopoly capital is strengthening its pressure on the British Empire, attempting to completely destroy the imperial preference system under the guise of "free trade," and abolish British tariff barriers in order to clear obstacles for American capital to advance.

America's attack on the British Empire is by no means limited to the economic sphere. The United States has seized British military bases scattered around the world and夺去了 taken away Britain's maritime hegemony. Before the war, the total tonnage of British merchant ships was greater than that of the United States. In 1947, the total tonnage of British merchant ships was 16 million tons, while the United States reached 46 million tons. Before the war, the total tonnage of the British naval fleet was 1.2 million tons, and the United States was 1 million tons; but in 1947, the total tonnage of the US fleet was 3.8 million tons, while Britain only had 1.5 million tons. American capital is trying to completely drive Britain out of the Western Hemisphere of the Americas. According to the US-Canada agreement a year ago, the US military can use Canadian military bases. Members of the US Senate and House of Representatives have repeatedly demanded that Britain cede its West Indian possessions to the United States as a condition for financial aid.

Britain believes that the establishment of the "British Near East Empire" was its main gain in the First World War, but now American capital is attempting to drive Britain out of this position. The United States has broken the monopoly of British oil companies there, seized all oil privileges in Saudi Arabia, and Britain was soon forced to abandon a large part of its oil resources in Iran. Britain once controlled 56 percent of Middle East oil production, but the United States has also seized 36 percent of it. The conclusion states that behind the facade of Anglo-American cooperation, Britain and the United States are conducting an intense struggle in the Near East.

　　英美在合作的招牌后面
    两国进行紧张斗争
  　英国利益被美攫夺尽净
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“劳动报”在题为“美国与英国”一文中，详述美英之间现所存在的尖锐斗争。该文称：在美国政治性著述中说道：“大英帝国崩溃的速度，可能较美国所能填充这种真空的速度来得更快”，美国对此问题焦虑不安。换言之，即美国害怕大英帝国的遗产会逃脱它的掌握。该文回溯称：美国独占资本正加强对英帝国的压力，在“自由贸易”的烟幕下，力图完全摧毁帝国特惠制，撤消英国关税壁垒，以便为美国资本扫清前进的障碍。
    美国对英帝国的打击绝不仅限于经济方面，美国攫取了英国散处全球的军事基地，夺去了英国的海上霸权。战前英国商船总吨数较美国为多，一九四七年，英国商船总吨数为一千六百万吨，而美国却达到四千六百万吨。战前英国海军舰队的总吨数是一百二十万吨，美国是一百万吨；而在一九四七年美国舰队总吨数是三百八十万吨，英国却只有一百五十万吨。美国资本正力图将英国完全逐出西半球的美洲，美国军队根据一年前的美加协定，可以使用加拿大的军事基地。美参众两院议员曾一再要求英国将其西印度群岛之属地让与美国，作为财政援助的条件。
    英国认为“英近东帝国”的建立，是它在第一次世界大战中的主要收获，但如今美国资本企图将英国逐出这一阵地，美国已打破英国石油公司在那里的垄断地位，攫取了沙特阿剌伯的全部石油特权，英国并很快的被迫放弃它在伊朗石油资源中的很大部分，英国曾控制中东石油产量的百分五十六，但美国也攫取了其中的百分之三十六。结论称：在英美合作的招牌后面，英美正在近东进行紧张的斗争。
