Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. Many areas in Shandong have organized women to participate in agricultural and sideline production, and have achieved results. During the spring plowing season, many places faced food shortages. Lunan, Central Shandong, and coastal areas widely organized women to engage in several sideline productions such as making shoes, textiles, weaving mats, and weaving raincoats. The income from making shoes and textiles alone reached 1,494,400,000+ North Sea currency. (Each yuan is equivalent to 100 National currency yuan), which can solve the food problem for 120,000 people for six months. For example, after 30,000 women in the Fifth District of Cangshan County (newly established county in Lunan) engaged in textile production to solve the spring famine, 80% of the spring fields (early-maturing crops sown in spring) in the entire district were quickly cultivated, and more than 3,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. In addition to sideline production, women also participated in a large amount of agricultural labor such as pounding manure, delivering manure, pulling plows, sowing seeds, hoeing weeds, and weeding seedlings. In Huang Gou Village, Qidong and Yiyuan (newly established county), 26 women were divided into groups led by men, who taught them while hoeing. In 25 days, they hoed 278 mu of sorghum and millet seedlings, hoed wheat twice, and hoed corn and cotton once, saving 277 male labor forces for transportation. In Jiangjia Garden Village, Jiaogao (newly established county, part of Jiaoxian and Gaomi counties) in Jiaodong, a total of 28 households, 28 men participated in digging the river, and 27 women and children were organized into six groups, hoeing 20 mu of land in two days. When the People's Liberation Army attacked Changle and Weixian, women in Shouguang, Bohai, completed the task of supporting the front lines with 2.5 million jin of public grain by pushing mills and grinding stones for half a month, saving a large number of animal power for spring plowing. The majority of women in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts of the county participated in spring plowing. All 500 mu of wheat fields in Changjia Village were hoeed by women. (Editor's note: Patiently mobilizing and organizing rural women to engage in agricultural and handicraft production is an extremely important task for all liberated areas. It is hoped that the leading organs of all liberated areas will pay attention to this and publish the experience in this area as much as possible.)

　　鲁南鲁中滨海等地
  　组织妇女参加生产
    仅做鞋纺织所得即可解决十二万人六个月食粮
    【新华社华东十二日电】山东许多地区，组织妇女参加农业及副业生产，已得到成效。春耕期间各地粮食困难，鲁南、鲁中、滨海等地广泛组织妇女进行做鞋纺织编席编蓑等几种副业生产，仅做鞋纺织两项收入，即达北海币十四亿九千四百余万元。（每元合蒋币百元）可解决十二万人六个月的食粮。如苍山（鲁南新设县）县五区经三万妇女进行纺织解决春荒后，全区百分之八十的春田（春季下种之早熟作物）得以很快耕完，并开荒三千余亩。除副业生产外，妇女还大量地参加了捣粪送粪拉犁下种以及锄草剜苗等农业劳动。齐东、沂源（新设县）黄沟村二十六个妇女分组由男子带头，边锄边教，二十五天中共剐高粱谷子苗二百七十八亩，麦子锄了两遍，玉蜀黍棉花锄了头遍，节省了二百七十七个男劳动力参加了运输。胶东胶高（新设县胶县高密各一部）蒋家园村共二十八户，廿八个男人参加了挖河，二十七个妇女儿童即编成六个小组，于两天中锄地二十亩。渤海寿光妇女在解放军进攻昌乐潍县时，半个月推碾推磨完成了二百五十万斤公粮的支前任务，节省了大批畜力用于春耕。该县六七八区妇女，绝大部分参加了春耕，常家庄村五百亩麦田即全部由妇女锄完。（编者按：耐心地动员与组织农村妇女来从事农业与手工业生产，是目前各解放区一项极端重要的任务，望各解放区的领导机关加以重视，并将这方面的经验尽量发表。）
