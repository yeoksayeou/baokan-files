Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd. The Central China Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions calling on Party committees at all levels and the entire military and civilian population in the area to protect the summer harvest and summer planting. The instructions are as follows: (1) All armed forces should continue to promote the spirit of active offense, advance into the border areas, and penetrate deep behind enemy lines to protect the masses' summer harvest and summer planting. (2) Launch mass self-defense and production movements. All localities must achieve rapid harvesting, rapid attacks, and rapid storage. In areas subject to Chiang Kai-shek bandit "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping up" operations, and in border areas, it is necessary to launch mass guerrilla warfare, organize rush harvesting teams, with one hand holding a gun and the other a sickle, and systematically and rapidly transfer grain to prevent the enemy from seizing a single grain. At the same time, it is also necessary to achieve rapid plowing and rapid planting, leaving no land uncultivated. (3) Resolutely oppose bureaucraticism in leadership, actively eliminate the masses' concerns about production, solve their difficulties, and correct the tendency of wrongly classifying class and infringing on the interests of middle peasants in practical actions to enhance the masses' enthusiasm for production. (4) Military units, government organs, and local staff must implement streamlining and economy. During the summer harvest and summer planting season, all mass meetings and logistical burdens should be reduced to the minimum, and at the same time, vigorously help the masses carry out production.
