　　Pengcheng Futian Village Bowl Kiln Returned to Its Original Owner
　　[Cixian News] During the re-examination movement in Futian Village, Pengcheng Town, last year, the bowl kilns of Li Fangfu and Li Fanghua were liquidated, and the kiln furniture, materials, and store goods were all confiscated. The total value was estimated at over 6.49 million yuan (currency unspecified), and the masses elected another manager. Business began in October of the lunar calendar last year, and by the end of the year, the net profit was over 3.39 million yuan, which was all used to buy materials for the factory, and not distributed to the masses, in preparation for expansion this year. In February, over 600,000 yuan was spent on repairing a kiln, and in March, another bowl kiln was developed, employing over 20 workers. After the instructions from the Central Bureau arrived, the county committee and district workers went to the village and discussed with the village cadres. They first solicited the opinions of the masses, who reflected: "When we confiscated it, there were two kilns and no materials. Now there are three kilns and more materials. He (the original owner) would be happy to have it back!" The workers said: "Seeing that it's about to be returned to him, we spend money every day on repairing it with tile workers and buying materials, isn't it all for his benefit?" The leadership patiently explained these opinions, explaining the benefits of developing industry and commerce for the masses. Finally, it was unanimously decided that the wrongly infringed upon property would be returned to the original owner.

　　彭城富田村碗窑归原主
    【磁县消息】彭城镇富田村去年复查运动时，把李芳付、李芳花两个碗窑清算了，窑厂家具、材料、门市部货物，一并没收。共折价洋六百四十九万余元，群众另选出经理。去年阴历十月开始营业，到年底结帐，净余红利三百卅九万余元，把红利全部买成工厂内的材料，没有分配给群众，准备到今年发展。二月补修了一个窑，用钱六十多万元，三月间又发展了一个碗窑，用工人廿多个。中央局的指示下来后，县委与区工作员到村，与村干部共同讨论了一次，首先征求群众意见，群众反映说：“咱们没收他的时候两个窑，材料没有，现在成了三个窑，材料也多了，他倒愿意！”工人说：“眼看马上就给人家退，每天用瓦匠修理又买材料，还不是给人家弄的？”领导上对这些意见进行耐心的解释，说明发展工商业对群众的利益。终于一致决定：错误侵犯的退还给原主。
