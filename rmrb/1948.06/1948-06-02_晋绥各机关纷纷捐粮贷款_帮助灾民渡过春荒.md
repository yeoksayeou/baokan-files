Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 30th. The Jin-Sui Administrative Office recently convened a meeting of representatives from first-level organs in the border region to summarize disaster relief experience and decided that all organs should make their utmost efforts to help disaster victims in designated areas ensure the sowing of autumn fields and overcome this period of food shortage. The meeting summarized the disaster relief achievements of various organs: (1) All organ mess units and individuals donated grain and clothing, and some comrades even helped with everything they had. The grain alone amounted to more than 244 big "shi" (each "shi" is 260 "jin", same below). (2) Several production departments also lent disaster relief grain for production funds without interest or at low interest, totaling 77 big "shi". (3) Cooperatives of various units transferred and adjusted grain to the market for sale, reaching 1,315 big "shi". Due to these relief grain loans and sales, the disaster situation in the disaster-stricken areas designated by the border region organs did not continue to develop, and summer fields could be sown. However, since all food rations, seeds, and livestock have been used for summer field sowing, and the summer harvest has not yet arrived, this period of food shortage is the biggest difficulty currently facing the masses. Therefore, the Administrative Office has once again called on all organs to take out the remaining grain to continue relief efforts, except for the necessary rations for the organs themselves. The meeting decided: (1) To donate another 188 big "shi" of relief grain, which will be centrally used for areas with more severe disasters and disaster-stricken households. (2) Various production departments will provide another 604 "shi" of food grain as interest-free or low-interest loans, which will be repaid by the borrowers after the summer harvest or autumn harvest. However, it must be pointed out that the purpose of low-interest loans is for relief and not for profit. Therefore, both public and private interests must be taken into account to avoid losses for the production departments and to prevent the masses from being unable to repay. (3) Livestock from various organs will organize the transportation of relief grain, and the local governments will pay the transportation costs. The masses' livestock will be organized to assist in transportation. Cooperatives of various organs will transfer and adjust food grain again, selling at least another 364 big "shi" to adjust the market. The meeting particularly pointed out that disaster relief work is a major political task at present. The masses in the border region supported the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Revolutionary War. We should uphold the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" with the masses in the border region, overcome the disaster, and overcome this difficult period together.

　　晋绥各机关纷纷捐粮贷款
  　帮助灾民渡过春荒
    【新华社晋绥卅日电】晋绥行署顷召开边区一级机关代表会议，总结救灾经验，并决定各机关再以最大努力帮助指定地区灾民保证秋田下种，并渡过此青黄不接时期。会议总结各机关救灾成绩：（一）各机关伙食单位及个人都捐出了粮食和衣物，若干同志甚至倾囊相助，仅粮食达二百四十四大石以上（每石二百六十斤，下同）。（二）若干生产部门亦无利或低利贷出，供群众作生产基金的灾粮共七十七大石。（三）各单位合作社周转调剂粮食到市场出售，达一千三百一十五大石，由于这些救济粮借粮和售粮，使边区机关指定救灾地区灾情未继续发展，夏田得以播种，但因所有口粮种籽和畜力多已用于夏田播种，而现在夏收未到，这种青黄不接时期已是群众目前最大的困难，故行署再度号召各机关除留下本机关必须口粮外，拿出其余存粮继续救济。会上决定：（一）再捐助救济粮一百八十八大石，集中用于灾情较重地区和受灾户。（二）各生产部门再以六百零四石食粮作无利或低利借贷，夏收或秋收后由借户归还，但必须指出低利借贷之目的在救济而不在营利，故须公私兼顾不使生产部门亏损，也不使群众无法偿还。（三）各机关牲口组织运输救济粮，由各地政府付脚价，组织群众牲口协助运输，各机关合作社再运转调剂食粮，至少再出售三百六十四大石，调剂市面。会议中特别指出救灾工作是目前的重大政治任务，边区群众支援了抗日战争与革命战争，我们应本与边区群众“有难同当有福同享”的精神，战胜灾荒，共同渡过这个困难时期。
