Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- According to an Associated Press report: Harry Bridges, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), affiliated with the CIO, sharply criticized the Truman administration's order against the maritime workers' strike, issued under the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act, at a mass meeting of maritime workers in Los Angeles on the 15th. According to this order, the joint wage increase strike of 150,000 members of the four major CIO maritime unions, scheduled for June 15th, could not be held during the 80-day "cooling-off period" after the strike was announced. Bridges said: "If the shipowners or Truman think we are so docile and easy to bully, they are wrong. I can be certain: there will be a strike, and it will be the fiercest one yet. Although I cannot say it will come at the same time, it will be the same whether it comes on September 5th or June 15th." Bridges powerfully called for turning the 80-day "cooling-off period" into a "heating-up period" (meaning active preparation). He said: "To get tense, eighty days is just right." According to a United Press report: Maritime unions on the US West Coast jointly protested to Truman on the 13th, asking him to "reconsider this rash action." Note: According to a clause in the Taft-Hartley reactionary bill passed by the US Congress last June, the president has the power to forcibly freeze strikes that "threaten national security and normalcy" for 80 days. During this 80-day "cooling-off period," a fact-finding commission appointed by the president will conduct an "investigation" and then handle the strike based on the commission's report.

　　布利治在洛杉矶海员工人大会上
  　抨击杜鲁门干涉罢工
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据美联社消息：美产联所属国际码头与仓库工人工会主席布利治，十五日在洛杉矶海员工人群众大会上，尖锐抨击杜鲁门政府根据塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法所颁布的反对海员罢工的命令。依照这一命令，产联四大海员工会十五万人订于六月十五日举行的联合增资大罢工，在宣布罢工后八十天的“冷静期”内将不能举行。布利治说：“假如船老板或杜鲁门以为我们是这样驯服好欺，那就错了。我可以确定：将有一次罢工，而且将是最厉害的一次。我虽不能说它同时到来，但它在九月五日到来和在六月十五日到来，将是一样的。”布氏有力地号召将八十天的“冷静期”化为“加热期”（按即积极准备之意）。他说：“要搞得紧张起来，八十天的时间正好”。另据合众社消息：美西岸各海员工会曾于十三日联名向杜鲁门提出抗议，要求他“考虑这一粗率的行动”。按：根据美国会去年六月通过的塔夫脱——哈特莱反动法案中的一条，总统有权对所谓“威胁国家安全与常态”的罢工强迫冻结八十天，在这八十天的“冷静期”间，由总统任命一事实调查委员会进行“调查”，然后根据该委员会之报告处理罢工。
