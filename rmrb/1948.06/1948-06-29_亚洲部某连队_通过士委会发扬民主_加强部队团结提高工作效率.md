The Asian Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Frontline Dispatch, 27th. A soldiers' committee in a certain company of the "Asian" division of the North China Liberation Army has become an important organizational form for implementing military, political, and economic democracy in the company. It has improved the soldiers' consciousness and organization, strengthened unit unity, and increased work efficiency. This soldiers' committee was established after the Three Check-ups, Speaking Out Grievances, and Democratic Movement. For more than three months, the company's administrative leadership and branch leadership have been able to abide by the Provisional Regulations on Soldiers' Committees issued by the × Committee, respect the democratic rights of the soldiers' committee, and lead the work of the soldiers' committee. The company's training, marching, merit-making, and food plans can all solicit the opinions of the soldiers' committee and the soldiers' congress in advance, and allow full discussion; even after a resolution is made and an order is issued, the soldiers' committee and the soldiers' congress are still allowed to discuss how to implement it specifically. Even if there are different opinions on the resolution, they can be submitted to the leadership for reference. The soldiers' committee and the soldiers' congress have held more than ten meetings, and have put forward constructive and specific opinions on various plans of the branch in advance, which have been adopted by the branch and administrative leadership. Even individual dissenting opinions are suggested to the branch for consideration, but before a reply is received, they can unconditionally and consciously implement the resolution. When waiting for an opportunity to train in a certain place, the branch decided that the central task was training. The soldiers' committee, based on the branch's resolution and the soldiers' demands, proposed the conditions for model students and model learning classes to earn merits, and called on the soldiers to compete for merits in training. Thus, the training plan became a voluntary merit-making plan for the soldiers. Combined with the five-minute review meeting of each class before going to bed every day, the advantages and disadvantages of each person's training every day were recorded and reported to the merit-making committee member in the soldiers' committee every week as a concrete basis for evaluating merits in the two-week training. During training, the soldiers' committee also put forward vivid slogans such as "five minutes of aiming, ten minutes of bayonet practice." After a month, the training results were very good. In other companies, one person could stab up to forty-five steps in one breath, but they could stab seventy-five steps in one breath. Other marching or temporary calls from the branch were completed in this way. The soldiers' committee and the soldiers' congress have truly become the best mass organizational form under the leadership of the branch to promote democracy, mobilize the masses, and complete all central tasks. In this way, cadres and party members can receive the supervision and encouragement of the broad masses of soldiers in the implementation of resolutions. In May, a meeting of cadres above the platoon level suggested giving the political instructor a minor merit. However, when it was submitted to the soldiers' congress for approval, thirty or forty people spoke and immediately pointed out to the political instructor: "You have achievements in your work, but you do not meet the conditions for merit, because you still have shortcomings." The merit suggestion was rejected. The political instructor and the platoon leaders deeply felt the correctness and sharpness of the soldiers' opinions. Afterwards, the political instructor worked even harder, and the soldiers, seeing that the political instructor could accept criticism and immediately strive to correct it, respected the political instructor even more.

The soldiers' committee has also established organizations and systems for implementing various forms of democracy. The soldiers' committee is divided into five departments: one is the military and political research committee, which is responsible for reading newspapers, military and political question-and-answer discussions, mobilizing soldiers to help each other in learning, and reflecting the soldiers' daily opinions on military and political aspects. The second is the economic committee, which is responsible for the income and expenditure of food, supervising the kitchen and the settlement and announcement of accounts, reflecting the soldiers' opinions, and improving food. The third is the cultural and entertainment committee, which is responsible for the soldiers' daily democratic life, running the wall newspaper "Soldiers Performing for Soldiers," singing, literacy, praising models, and criticizing backwardness. The fourth is the merit-making committee, which cultivates and controls meritorious persons, initiates and leads revolutionary competitions, manages the merit registration book, registers merits, evaluates merits, and congratulates merits. The fifth is the discipline inspection committee, which is responsible for the mass supervision of mass discipline, prisoner discipline, city discipline, and military discipline, and also does civilian work. In order to timely reflect and resolve the soldiers' daily opinions and implement the resolutions of the soldiers' committee, each committee has secretaries in each platoon and group members in each squad. For example, the economic committee has economic secretaries in each platoon and vegetable duty officers in each squad. They take turns on duty in the kitchen to supervise expenses, help the kitchen, solicit opinions from the kitchen, and discuss improving food. If soldiers have opinions on food, they can immediately reflect them through the vegetable duty officer and get them resolved. Up to now, this set of soldiers' democratic organizations and systems has indeed guaranteed the implementation of various forms of soldiers' democracy, and has organized this democracy into disciplined action. The responsible comrades of the branch and the administration said: "After the establishment of the soldiers' committee and the development of democracy, everyone is more conscious in carrying out orders, and everyone is rushing to do everything. For example, when it comes to getting up, without blowing the wake-up call, everyone is rushing to get there. We are not as busy as before, but the results are indeed much greater than in the past." The soldiers also said: "Now everyone wants to make merits, and they regard falling behind as a shameful thing. Although it cannot be said that there is no violation of discipline in terms of discipline, it is very rare." In the past four months, all the plans of the company have been successfully completed, and the "Asian" division has praised the company's soldiers' committee as a model for the entire division.

　　亚洲部某连队
  　通过士委会发扬民主
  　加强部队团结提高工作效率
    【前线廿七日电】华北解放军“亚洲”部某连士兵委员会，已成为实行连队军事、政治、经济民主重要的组织形式，提高了士兵的自觉性、组织性，加强了连队团结，提高了工作效率。该士委会成立于三查、诉苦、民主运动后，三个多月来，连上行政领导及支部领导都能遵照×委“士委会暂行条例”，尊重士委会民主权利，领导士委会工作。该连训练、行军、立功、伙食各种计划，事先都能征求士委会及士兵大会意见，允许充分讨论；事后虽经决议，发出命令，还允许士委会士兵大会作如何具体执行的讨论。即使对决议有不同意见，亦许提出供给领导参考。士委会士兵大会前后开会十几次，对支部各种计划事先都提出过建设性的具体意见，供给支部和行政领导上采纳。偶有个别不同意见，建议支部考虑，但不得答复前，又能无条件的自觉执行。在某地待机训练时，支部决定中心工作是训练。士委会则根据支部决议和士兵要求提出模范学员、学习模范班的立功条件，号召士兵在训练中竞赛立功，于是训练计划就成为士兵自愿的立功计划了。与各班每天睡前五分钟检讨会相结合，把每个人每天训练中的优缺点纪录下来，每周统一汇报给士委会中的立功委员，做为两周训练评功时的具体根据。训练中，士委会还提出了“五分钟瞄准，十分钟刺枪”等生动口号。一个月后，训练成绩很好，别连刺枪一人一口气最多刺四十五步，他们一人一口气刺七十五步。其他行军或支部临时号召都是这样完成的。士委会士兵大会真正成为支部领导下，发扬民主，发动群众，完成一切中心工作的最好的群众组织形式。这样就使得干部党员在执行决议中，得到广大士兵的监督鼓励。五月份排以上干部会曾建议给指导员立一小功。但提交士兵大会通过时，发言的三四十人，当场就给指导员提出：“你工作有成就，但不够立功条件，因为你还有缺点”，立功建议被否决。指导员和各排长们深深感到士兵群众意见的正确、尖锐。事后指导员更努力了，士兵见指导员能够接受批评，马上努力纠正，对指导员更尊敬了。
    该士委会又建立了实行各种民主的组织与制度。士委会下分五部门，一为军政研究委员，掌管读报、军政问答讨论，发动战士互助学习，反映士兵对军政各方面的日常意见。二为经济委员，掌管伙食收支，监督灶房及帐目结算公布，反映士兵意见，改善伙食。三为文化娱乐委员，掌管士兵日常民主生活，办墙报“兵演兵”，唱歌、识字、表扬模范批评落后。四为立功委员，培养掌握功臣，发起领导革命竞赛，掌握功劳登记簿，登功、评功、贺功。五为纪律检查委员，负责群众性的监督群纪、俘纪、城纪、军纪、并做民运工作。为了及时反映解决士兵日常意见，贯彻士委会决议，在各委员下面，各排设有干事，班有组员。如经济委员，排设经济干事，班有菜值日。一面轮流在伙房值班，监督开支，帮助伙房，征求伙房意见，商量改善伙食。士兵有伙食意见，即可经过菜值日马上反映上来，得到解决。到现在，这一套土兵的民主组织和制度，已确实保证实行了士兵各种民主，并把这种民主组织起来，成为有纪律的行动。支部、行政的负责同志说：“成立士兵委员会，开展民主后，大家执行命令可自觉啦，什么也是抢着干。例如起床罢，不吹起床号，大家都争着赶到了。我们不象以前瞎忙了，但成绩确实比过去大得多”。士兵也说：“现在谁也想立功，把落后看成是丢人的事，纪律方面现在虽不能说犯纪律的一点没有了，但少得很了”。四个月来，该连所有计划都胜利完成，“亚洲”部已誉该连士委会为全部队的模范。
