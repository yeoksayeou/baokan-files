Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: Nanshuiya Village, Buxia District, Feixian County, Lunan, has preliminarily reformed more than a dozen landlord households, enabling them to participate in labor and solving a troublesome problem for the village's masses. The landlord Jia Wanjun in this village used to be an opium smoker two or three years ago. Another landlord, Jia Wanquan, ate 300 catties of pork in exchange for sorghum last year alone. They didn't care about the next meal after eating the current one. After finishing their own, they would borrow from their former tenants or hired laborers (who have generally been promoted to middle peasants after the liberation). If they couldn't borrow, they would steal. For example, Jia Wanjun stole a pot from Beixuyai Village and sold it to buy opium. Jia Wanxuan stole a chicken and cooked it. Sometimes when they couldn't steal, they would beg for food from the liberated peasants. If given soup, they would also want pancakes. If given pancakes, they would also want vegetables. This became a big trouble for the masses. The masses discussed this one after another saying, "These shameless people used to exploit people, eating fish and meat and smoking opium all day long. Now that they can't exploit anymore, they have changed their ways to ruin the poor. What should we do?" Some said, "These people are bottomless pits, borrowing, stealing, and demanding. How can we ever fill them up?" Others said, "Isn't this still exploitation?" In fact, these dozen or so landlord households surnamed Jia didn't have less land than any other peasant, and they had good land close to their homes. This spring plowing season, the whole village organized mutual aid teams, busily carrying manure and plowing the land. However, these landlords were basking in the sun against the wall all day long. The masses were very anxious at this time, worried that their grain would be begged for or stolen again in the future. Some felt that it was a pity to see the land left for the landlords lying barren. For this reason, after a night of discussion among the village cadres and the masses, it was decided to mobilize the landlords to produce through persuasion and education. If it was really ineffective, necessary coercion should be carried out to ensure that they must produce. They were immediately assigned to various mutual aid groups, and each group would help, educate, and supervise them. Then, a meeting of landlords was immediately called to expose their ideas of being fond of idleness and point out the prospects of labor production. On the spot, the landlord Jia Wanquan expressed his determination to transform himself, and the next day he began to participate in the mutual aid group, and later actively planted sorghum and hoeed wheat fields. However, some still refused to change, such as Jia Wanjun, who went to the field once and then went home pretending to be sick. On April 20th, the village called another meeting for them. This time the exposure was more thorough. The masses calculated their debts, the stealing, the borrowing, the exploitation... telling them that if they didn't work, they would have to pay back the debts. As soon as Jia Wancai heard that he had to pay back the debts, he immediately guaranteed that he would get up early to collect manure and go to the fields during the day to produce. Jia Wanlong also made up his mind to learn how to do it, so as not to go hungry after the land was barren. Village Chief Wang Wenting, according to everyone's opinions, limited them to finishing sowing in the fields within three days, reporting every five days, and proposing solutions if there were any difficulties. After the meeting, the Jia landlords all moved. The masses gave them a lot of help in their labor. For example, the peasant Wang Baoxing gave Jia Wancai some pumpkin seeds. Jia Wanxuan didn't know how to sow, so Old Man Wang showed him how to do it and taught him. Jia Wanlong didn't know how many sorghum seeds were needed per mu, so Village Chief Wang Wenting personally measured and calculated for him, and told him the planting method. By April 24th, the landlords' land had been sown.

　　鲁南费县南许崖村
  　说服强制地主生产
    【新华社华东四日电】鲁南费县埠下区南许崖村，初步改造了十几户地主，使他们参加劳动，解决了该村群众一件麻烦的问题。该村地主贾万钧，前两三年还是吸鸦片烟；另一地主贾万泉，去年一年就换了三百斤高粱的猪肉吃，他们吃了上顿不管下顿，吃完自己的就向他们过去的佃户或雇工（翻身后一般现已升为中农）去借，借不到就偷，如贾万钧偷过北许崖村的锅，卖了后偷吸大烟，贾万选偷了鸡烧了吃，有时偷不到，就向翻身农民要饭，给了汤喝，他还要煎饼，给他煎饼，他还要吃菜，这就成了群众一个大麻烦，群众纷纷议论说：“这些死皮癞脸的，过去剥削人，成天吃鱼吃肉吸大烟，现在不能剥削了，就换个样子来糟踏穷人，怎么办呢？”有的说：“这伙子人是无底的洞，又借，又偷、又要，咱那能填得满他们”。也有的说：“这个样子还不算剥削吗”？实际上这十几户姓贾的地主，他们的土地并不比任何一个农民少，而且有好地近地。今年春耕时，全村组组织了变工队，忙着挑粪耕地，可是这伙地主，却一天蹲在墙根晒太阳。群众这时很着急，耽心以后他们的粮食又会被要去偷去。有的觉得留给地主们的土地眼看着荒了，实在可惜。为此经过该村干部群众一夜讨论，决定以说服教育方法，动员地主生产。如实在无效，则须进行必要的强制，一定要他们生产，并当场分工，将地主分编在各变工组，由各组进行帮助教育与监督。接着立即召集地主开会，揭发其好吃懒做思想，并指出劳动生产前途，当场地主贾万泉表示决心转变，并于第二天开始参加了变工组，以后又积极种了高粱锄了麦田。但有些则还是不肯转变，如贾万钧，到地里走了一趟就回家装病了。四月二十日，村里又召集他们开会，这次揭发更彻底，群众给他们算起帐来，偷的、借的、剥削的………告诉他们如不劳动，就得还帐。贾万才一听到要还帐，立刻保证以后早起拾粪，白天下地生产。贾万隆也下决心学着干，免得地荒了以后挨饿。村长王文廷又根据大家意见，限他们三天地里下种完毕，五天一汇报，有困难提出来想法解决。会后贾姓各地主都动起来了，劳动中群众给他们以不少帮助。如农民王保兴送了贾万才一些南瓜籽，贾万选不会下种，王老头给他做样子，让他学会，贾万隆不知一亩地需要下多少高粱种籽，村长王文廷亲自给他量算，并告以种法。到四月二十四日，地主们的土地已播种完毕。
