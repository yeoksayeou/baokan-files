　　Jizhong Branch Expands Business
  　Actively Supports Industry and Commerce
    [Jizhong News] Since the district party committee issued specific measures to protect industry and commerce in February this year, the Jizhong Branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank has actively expanded its business to support the development of industry and commerce. The number of institutions handling deposit and loan business has increased from 12 last year to 25. Last year, only dozens of households in various places established current overdraft deposit relationships with the bank. By May of this year, the number establishing such relationships with the Xinji branch had increased to 1,278, accounting for 80% of all industrial and commercial households in the city (including small vendors, totaling more than 1,500). More than 770 households established relationships with the Anguo branch, accounting for 70% of all industrial and commercial households. In Botou City, the number of households establishing relationships with the branch increased from dozens last year to 305 this year, accounting for more than one-sixth of the city's industrial and commercial households (including small vendors, totaling more than 1,700). Business has also progressed in other places such as Hejian. In terms of lending business, the spirit of developing production and prospering industry and commerce has generally been firmly grasped. Speculators and producers of consumables that are not beneficial to the liberated areas are absolutely not granted loans, and those who are found to have used the loan for unintended purposes after the loan is issued are immediately recovered. In terms of deposits, the bank collects, pays, and remits funds on behalf of state-owned enterprises, while also paying attention to absorbing private deposits. In Botou City, the bank absorbed 1.4 billion border currency from private industrial and commercial households in April, accounting for 37% of the total deposits. They have adopted a policy of depositing when available and withdrawing when needed, which has provided great convenience to industrial and commercial households. Special attention is paid to developing industry and sideline production when providing loans. Industrial loans in Xinji account for 75% of the total loans. Support for industry also focuses on key areas. For example, there are 56 bamboo goods businesses in Botou City. By the end of April, 43 of them had established relationships with the bank, and loans to key industries accounted for 53% of the total industrial loans. Interest rates are particularly favorable for industry, especially heavy industry. In Botou City, the interest rate for commercial loans in May was 6 to 7.5%, the rate for general industry was 3%, and the rate for heavy industry was 2%. The Tonghe Paper Factory in Botou, the leather industry in Xinji, the shoe industry in Hejian, and the pharmaceutical industry in Anguo have all received support from bank loans. The Jizhong Workers Cooperative Sack Factory in Xinji had difficulty with raw materials, and the Yihe Spinning Factory in Shulu could not sell its finished products temporarily, and the funds could not be turned around. The bank helped them solve their difficulties. The bank has also helped some industries improve their technology and increase the quantity and quality of their production. A paper mill in Botou originally made black paper, but after obtaining a loan, it purchased new raw materials and switched to making white rough paper. A certain fire-field factory could not continue to develop due to insufficient funds. With the support of the loan, it can now produce 150 kilograms per day, and the quality has also been greatly improved. The bank has also supported some handicrafts, such as Zhao Changfa and his brother in An'guo Fucun who opened an oil mill. Due to the lack of funds, they had to work for others. After obtaining a loan from the bank, they started operating independently, and in just 25 days, they earned 1.2 million ocean dollars.

　　冀中分行扩张业务
  　积极扶植工商业
    【冀中讯】自今年二月间区党委发出保护工商业的具体办法后，晋察冀边区银行冀中分行即积极扩展业务，扶植工商业发展。办理存放款业务的机构已由去年的十二处增至二十五处。去年各地和银行建立来往透支存放关系的只有几十户，在今年五月间，与辛集支行建立上述关系的已增至一千二百七十八户，占该市全部工商户（连小摊贩在内共一千五百余家）的百分之八十。与安国支行建立来往关系的七百七十余户，占全部工商户的百分之七十。泊头市和支行建立关系的由去年的数十户增至今年的三百零五户，占该市工商户（连小摊贩在内共一千七百余家）的六分之一强。他如河间等地，业务都有进展。在放款业务上，一般都紧紧掌握了发展生产繁荣工商业的精神。投机商及对解放区无利的消耗品生产者绝对不予贷款，贷款后检查出贷非所用者即刻收回。在存款方面，银行替公营企业代收代付代取代送款项，同时注意吸收私人存款。泊头市行四月份吸收私营工商户的存款达边币十四亿，占存款总数百分之三十七。对他们采取了有即存、用即取，给了工商户很大的便利。贷款时特别注意发展工业及副业生产，辛集工业贷款占货款总数百分之七十五。扶植工业也注意了掌握重点，如泊头市竹货业共五十六家，到四月底与银行建立来往关系者达四十三家，重点工业贷款占工贷总数的百分之五十三。在利息上对工业特别是重工业特予优待；泊头市行五月份商业放款利息为六到七点五分，一般工业为三分，重工业则为二分。泊头同和纸厂、辛集的皮革业、河间的鞋业、安国的药业都得到银行贷款的扶植。辛集冀中职工合作社麻袋厂的原料困难，束鹿义和纺纱厂成品一时卖不出，资金无法周转，银行都帮他们解决了困难。银行也帮助某些工业改良了技术，提高了生产数量与质量。泊头某造纸厂原来捞黑纸，经过贷款，采购了新的原料，改为捞白毛头纸。某火域厂因资金不足不能继续发展，经贷款扶植，现在每天能产一百五十斤，质量也大大提高。银行也扶助了一些手工业，如安国伏村赵长法弟兄二人开油房，因资金少，不得不给人家打手工，自银行贷款后，便单独经营起来，只二十五天，便赚洋百二十万元。
