Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 9th: TASS, New York—American progressive groups, recently included in the U.S. Attorney General's so-called "subversive" list, have issued statements of protest one after another, denouncing Clark's actions as "intimidating the American people." The Congress of American Women sent a letter to Clark stating that the Justice Department should publicly apologize to the thousands of women who have been falsely accused of being "subversives." The letter forcefully stated: "Your actions only increase our determination to fight for freedom for ourselves and our descendants." King Gans, the principal of the California Labor School, in a statement to the press, vehemently criticized Clark for including the school on the "subversive" list, calling it "Hitlerian hooliganism being implemented in the United States." The "American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born," the "American Committee for Relief to Yugoslavia," the "American Aid to Democratic Greece Committee," and others included on the list have also issued similar statements.

　　美国各进步团体
  　抗议司法部反动措施
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：上周为美司法部长列入所谓“破坏”团体名单中的美国各进步团体，顷纷纷发表抗议声明，谴责克拉克的行动是“恫吓美国人民”。美国妇女大会致函克拉克称：司法部应公开向被诬蔑为“破坏分子”的成千妇女道歉。该函力称：“你们的行动，更增加了我们要为我们自己及我们子孙争取自由斗争的决心。”加洲工人学校校长金根斯于向报界发表的声明中，痛斥克拉克将该校列入“破坏”团体名单中，是在“美国实施希特勒主义的流氓行为”。被列入该项名单中的“美国保护外国出生者委员会”、“美国对南斯拉夫救济委员会”、“美国援助民主希腊委员会”等，亦均发表类似声明。
