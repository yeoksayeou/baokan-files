　　[Jinan News] Ba Lizhuang in the Fourth District of Wei County has 272 households. The land quality is good, with an average of about five mu per person. During the review last year, 15 middle peasant households and 5 poor peasant households were wrongly struggled against. Including landlords and rich peasants, a total of 56 households were struggled against (another 3 middle peasant households did so voluntarily). A total of 90 people fled, including 34 middle peasants and 6 poor peasants. There were also several middle-poor peasant households who, fearing struggle, fled to Tangshan, affecting the entire village's production and causing unease. Poor peasants were waiting to be allocated land, and some who had already been allocated land were waiting to exchange it again. Three middle peasant households were still very frightened and asked to offer up their land. Wang Yongtai's mother said, "You can take our land as you please, give us whichever plot you want!" There was also little house building or renovation. After the work team publicized the policies, clarified the determination to unite with middle peasants, compensated those who had been wrongly struggled against, and emphasized that whoever plants reaps the harvest, opposing excessive eating and drinking, the masses were very happy, and their mood gradually stabilized. Now the spring land in this village has all been cultivated, and some have begun to weed the autumn seedlings and start repairing and building houses. At the same time, in order to resolutely implement the middle peasant policy, after discussion, it was decided to return the items taken from the wrongly struggled middle peasants. The County Committee also instructed this village to mobilize the masses by resolutely compensating the losses of the wrongly struggled middle and poor peasants. Under this influence, on May 6th, Li Fengge's wife, a middle peasant who had fled, and his daughter returned, and Guo Xin'er's wife, a middle peasant, was also preparing to return.

　　魏县八里庄补偿中农后
  　群众安心生产
    【冀南讯】魏县四区八里庄，有二百七十二户，土地质量不错，每人平均五亩左右。去年复查时，错斗中农十五户，错斗贫农五户，加上地主富农共斗争了五十六户（另有三户中农自动）。共逃亡九十名，内有中农卅四名，贫农六名，还有几户中贫农，怕斗逃跑到唐山，影响全村生产情绪不安。贫农等着分地，有的已分了地等着再换。有三户中农还很骇怕，要求献地，王永太娘说：“俺家的地你们随便要吧，愿意给俺丢哪块就丢哪块！”修房盖屋的也很少。经过工作组的宣传政策，表明了坚决团结中农，有错斗的一律补偿，并强调说明谁种谁收，反对大吃大喝。会后群众都很高兴，情绪逐渐稳定了。现下这村春地已都耕上了，有的开始锄秋苗，修房盖屋的也动工了。同时为坚决执行中农政策，经讨论结果，决定退还错斗中农物品。县委会也指示这村，要在坚决补偿中贫农损失中来发动群众。在这样影响下，五月六号中农逃亡户李凤格媳妇和他闺女回来了，中农郭新儿媳妇，也准备回来。
