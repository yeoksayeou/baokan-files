【Hebei Central News】Various parts of central Hebei are vigorously organizing the masses in flood and hail-stricken areas for production. More than 100 villages in five counties, including Qing County and Dacheng in the eastern part of the Eighth District, suffered severe hail damage on May 31, destroying more than 10,000 mu of wheat and spring seedlings. Our democratic government is providing strong relief and organizing the replanting of late fields. Qing County has distributed 25,000 jin of seeds and sent capable cadres to organize replanting teams to help farmers in 16 affected villages in the county with replanting. Some villages have organized mutual aid for replanting, while others have invited labor from other villages to help with the crash replanting. Many young and middle-aged people in the villages have been mobilized to use manpower to pull seed drills to plant the land, and most women have also gone down to the fields to sweep up wheat grains and collect wheat stalks. The county's Production Promotion Agency is preparing to issue loans to vigorously develop sideline occupations and appropriately reduce or exempt the grain tax in disaster areas to solve the future livelihood problems of the masses and lead them to overcome the famine. Cadres at all levels in Dacheng County have suspended all work to fully lead the masses in crash replanting, and the county party committee is personally going to the countryside to lead the masses in crash replanting. In Anxin's Third and Sixth Districts, villages such as Da Hou Village suffered severe hail damage, destroying a total of more than 30,400 mu of wheat seedlings, cotton, sorghum, and millet. In addition, the looting by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Baoding has made production difficult for the masses. Based on the disaster situation in the area, in addition to allocating 20,000 jin of grain and launching the masses of the whole county to donate firewood to the disaster area for relief, the Ninth Special Prefecture has also organized the masses for crash replanting. Under the armed cover of the working teams and militia, seed loans of more than 43 million yuan have now been completed for more than 660 households in 17 villages, solving the planting problem for more than 3,000 mu. Now, except for a few wheat fields reserved for planting late corn, all replanting has been completed, and efforts are being vigorously continued to provide loans for sideline occupations and handicrafts to solve the current livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims. At the same time, most villages in Wenxin County are waterlogged villages, and only a few villages can grow dry land crops, with floods occurring nine out of ten years. In the dry land townships of the county, the focus is on agricultural production, while in the waterlogged townships, sideline occupations and agriculture are carried out in parallel. In order to develop production and solve the livelihood difficulties of the masses, the county's Promotion Agency has lent out 416,064,500 yuan for agricultural and sideline occupations, and has driven private capital of 154,993,300 yuan, solving the difficulties of some livestock and seeds. At the same time, 20 heads of livestock, 28,000 jin of barley seeds, and 84,000 jin of rice seeds were also lent out. A total of 26,000 rice paddies have been dug in the county, and 49,831 mu of late-season rice land have been sown. Chengxiang District seized the production gap, transferred dryland draft animal power to waterlogged areas, and helped waterlogged areas carry out a major offensive, completing the sowing of 6,061 mu in eight days. Currently, there are still 39,060 mu in the county where the masses are being mobilized to continue crash planting. In terms of sideline occupation loans, two agricultural tool-making cooperative groups (one carpentry cooperative and one blacksmith shop) and a mass textile cooperative have been supported, and 27 fishing teams (each team with 10, 25, or 30 people) and 22 mat-making groups have been organized, initially solving the shortage of agricultural tools and capital.
