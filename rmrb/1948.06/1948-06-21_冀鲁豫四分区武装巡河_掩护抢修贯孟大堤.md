(Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 19th) The armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are protecting the repair of the Guanmeng Embankment in the border area. After leading the repair of the main section of the temporary Yellow River embankment at the top of Nantou in Changyuan, the Second Repair and Prevention Office of our Yellow River Committee mobilized civilian laborers from Hua County, Changyuan, and Weinan Counties to rush the repair of the northern section of the Guanmeng Embankment south of Changyuan, under the protection of local armed forces. Work started successively on May 15th, and by May 26th before the wheat harvest, the section from Zuozhai to Jiangtang (belonging to Quhe County) had been completed. This section is 10 kilometers long, 8 meters wide at the top, and 2 meters high, using 200,000 cubic meters of earth. Repairs will continue after the wheat harvest. The morale of the civilian laborers was extremely high during this repair, especially those from Hua County, who were the most enthusiastic. During the labor, some civilian laborers carried rifles, while others had grenades hanging on them. They said, "If the Chiang bandits come to harass us, we will fight them!" In order to complete this section of the project before the wheat harvest, night shifts were added. The civilian laborers voluntarily increased their earth-pushing work by four or five times each day. Normally, each person could only push two cubic meters of earth per day, but at this time, some could push seven or eight cubic meters, and generally, they could push four or five cubic meters.

　　On the 21st, in a place five li southeast of Qianxinzhuang, a small group of enemies ambushed on the beach, attempting to sabotage our embankment repair. However, they were discovered by our escorting troops, and after a fierce battle of half an hour, the enemy was routed. On the 22nd, our troops conducted another bandit suppression operation in the river beach, capturing Song ××, the deputy head of the puppet township team, and three others, seizing eight rifles and one pistol. Song and others confessed that they were assigned by the Chiang bandit army's 68th Division specifically to sabotage our embankment restoration. They have now been sent to the rear for interrogation. (Note: On August 17th of last year, the Chiang bandits breached the Guanmeng Embankment at Xinzhuangji, and the floodwaters broke through the embankment for a hundred zhang, causing a disaster to the people of Quhe County and other counties on our northern bank.)

　　冀鲁豫四分区武装巡河
  　掩护抢修贯孟大堤
    【冀鲁豫十九日电】冀鲁豫四分区武装，掩护抢修边分区之贯孟大堤。我黄委会第二修防处，自领导修好长垣顶南头一段临黄堤的主要部分后，又动员了滑县、长垣、卫南三县民工，在地方武装掩护下抢修长垣以南之贯孟堤北段。自五月十五日陆续开工，至麦前二十六日止，已修完左砦至江堂（曲河县属）一段，该段长十公里，顶宽八公尺，高二公尺。用土二十万公方。麦后将继续抢修。此次抢修中民工情绪极高，尤以滑县民工抢修最积极。民工们在劳动中，有的背着大枪，有的挂着手榴弹。他们说：“蒋匪来扰乱咱就和他拼！”为了在麦前完成该段工程，加开夜工。民工每天推土自动增加四五倍。平常每天每人只能推二方，这时有的能推七、八方，一般也能推四、五方。
    二十一日，前辛庄东南五里地方，有敌一小股埋伏于沙滩，企图破坏我方修堤。但被我掩护部队发觉，激战半小时，将敌击溃。二十二日我部队又在河滩内进行剿匪，捕获伪乡镇队队附宋××等三名，缴步枪八支，手枪一支。宋等供认系受蒋匪军六十八师指派，专门来破坏我方复堤。现已送后方审讯中。（按去年八月十七日蒋匪曾在贯孟堤新庄集处决口，洪水冲破堤口百丈，我北岸曲河等县人民曾遭水灾。）
