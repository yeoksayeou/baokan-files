Taihang News: Our guerrilla corps and local armed forces, active in the Fourth and Fifth Sub-districts of Yubei, have recently continuously struck at the plundering Chiang bandits, causing the enemy to run into snags everywhere. Such accumulation of small victories into a major victory has laid a new active foundation for the summer harvest food protection battle that has arrived in the Yubei area. On the night of May 12, the Second Detachment of the Fifth Sub-district used three companies to set up an ambush between Shuangta and Danian Village (west of Anyang), and another company to attack Shuangta, attracting enemy reinforcements from Danian Village. The company attacking Shuangta pinned the enemy inside a large building that night. At dawn, a portion of the 116th Brigade of the enemy from Danian Village attacked us in three routes. We immediately withdrew to Daxing Village and engaged the enemy who came to reinforce them. After several minutes of fighting, over twenty enemies were killed or wounded. On the same day and night, the × battalion of our First Detachment set up an ambush in Zhangjing Village (south of Qixian County). At 1:00 PM on the 13th, the puppet bandit Yang Fu's unit (Qixian County Security Regiment) attacked from Xigang. The enemy's advance troops discovered our unit and immediately turned around and ran. We tracked and pursued them to @ Street, cutting the enemy into two groups. One group hurriedly crossed the Qi River and fled east. While the enemy was crossing the river, we concentrated our firepower on one group, killing or wounding more than ten enemies. On the night of the 13th, the Second Detachment used two companies to set up an ambush at Qiukou (northwest of Anyang), and two companies to set up an ambush at Xiabaishu. At dawn on the 14th, a company of the Cixian County Security Regiment from Douchong Village advanced on Xiabaishu. The enemy's scouts discovered our unit and retreated. We seized the opportunity to annihilate the enemy scouts and withdrew to Shangbaishu. Upon hearing the news, the enemy stationed in Danian Village dispatched a battalion of the 116th Brigade for reinforcements. Upon reaching Xiaotun, our unit compressed the enemy into Xiabaishu. The enemy stubbornly resisted in the village, and a fierce battle ensued, resulting in more than twenty enemy killed, wounded and captured, two rifles seized, sixty rounds of ammunition, and six hundred thousand yuan in counterfeit currency. On the night of the 15th, a company of the First Detachment set up an ambush between Nanhoumazhuang Village and Guocunji, and two companies set up an ambush between Maguantun and Heguantun. At 6:00 AM on the 16th, twenty-two armed personnel from the Jianxin Township Office of the enemy Wei Jiaying Village entered our ambush circle from Houmazhuang. Our unit immediately launched a charge. After five minutes of fighting, all the enemies were wiped out except for nine who escaped. A total of five enemies were killed or wounded, eight were captured alive, three light machine guns, nine rifles, one pistol, seven hundred and sixty-two rounds of ammunition, and twelve bombs were seized. We suffered three casualties.

[Another Item] Our militia in the border areas of Jiaozuo, Qixian, and Jixian are also actively launching independent operations and achieving new victories. On May 9, the Qixian border militia work team took the initiative to attack Dache Village in the Third District. After the enemy discovered them, they concentrated hundreds of troops and surrounded us in two routes. After two hours of fierce fighting, seventeen enemies were killed or wounded, and we suffered no casualties. On the 13th, the puppet bandit Yang Fu colluded with over three hundred members of the Tangyin Society and attempted to loot grain and conscript soldiers in the west of the road, but pretended to be looking for our work team to take revenge. We immediately gave the enemy a head-on blow. In total, in the twenty days of fighting before and after this month, thirty-two enemies and one horse were killed or wounded, and we suffered no casualties. After killing, wounding or capturing twenty-eight enemies in April, the Jiaozuo border militia have further strengthened their activities since May. On the 6th and 7th of this month, in the battles of Gangzhuang, Li'ao, and Yangzhuang, they killed or wounded fifteen enemies, including the puppet self-defense team platoon leader Chen Xiaomao, in one fell swoop. Victory was also achieved in the Jincun battle on the 15th. On that day, Yuan Siming, the puppet self-defense battalion commander of the former Dong Township of Jiaozuo, led four companies, with six machine guns, about ninety people, launched a surprise attack on Jincun in our Third District in four routes at dawn, attempting to surround our Third District government office and local armed forces such as the militia. After a part of our Yubei Column coordinated with a company from the Jiaozuo Battalion and a part of the militia to make contact with the enemy, they launched a fierce charge against the enemy. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy fled backwards. Our troops detoured to the enemy's flanks and immediately launched a fierce battle against the enemy in the wheat fields south of Suncun in our Third District. A total of more than ten enemies were killed or wounded, and enemy special agents Ma Jinkun, Wang Maomao and others were captured, thirteen rifles, twenty bombs, more than seven hundred rounds of ammunition were seized, a group of people were rescued, and two large carts were recovered. In this battle, Comrade Ma Peiying, deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee of our Third District, gloriously sacrificed himself while leading the Fifth Brigade in pursuing the enemy. In total, in the first half of May, more than forty self-defense team platoon leaders and others were killed, wounded or captured. In addition, on the 15th of this month, more than three hundred enemies from Weihui invaded, but were also repelled by the work team of our Third District.
