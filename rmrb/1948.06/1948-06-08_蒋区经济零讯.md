　　Economic Snippets from the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
　　◇ American imperialism and the bureaucratic capitalist groups of the Four Families are now rapidly annexing local enterprises and expanding their sphere of influence in Fujian. According to Fujian newspapers, the Fuzhou Electric Company is about to be reorganized. The Chiang bandit's Ministry of Economic Affairs has already sent personnel to sign a contract with the Resources Commission. Once signed, the reorganization will proceed. The contract stipulates that the Resources Commission will invest 700 billion, while the original assets of the Electric Company will be valued at 300 billion. New machinery and fuel will be supplied by Taiwan Power Company. Furthermore, Liu Gongyun, the deputy governor of the Chiang bandit's Central Bank, is planning to establish a large-scale yarn factory with 10,000 spindles in Fujian. The Shanghai "CC" faction's Industrial and Mining Bank will also establish a branch in Fuzhou.
　　◇ U.S. dollars are becoming increasingly popular in the Chiang-controlled areas. In Shanghai, even retailers and landlords are increasingly using U.S. dollars for transactions. As for travelers going to the United States, they must use U.S. dollars to buy ship or plane tickets.
　　◇ The Standing Committee of the Sichuan Bandit Province Assembly revealed in a meeting that the Chiang bandit is plundering grain everywhere. The Chiang bandit's Minister of Grain, Yu Feipeng, went to Sichuan in March, ostensibly to allocate grain from the county public grain, but in reality, he sent people to buy grain in the market with large amounts of Chiang currency. Therefore, wherever the Yu bandit went, prices soared accordingly.

　　蒋区经济零讯
    ◇美帝与四大家族官僚资本集团，现正迅速在福建吞并地方企业，扩张其势力范围。据福建报纸消息：福州电气公司即将改组，已由蒋匪经济部派员与资委会签订合同，一俟签订就绪，即进行改组。该合同规定由资委会出资七千亿，电气公司原有资产折价三千亿，新机件及燃料则由台湾电力公司供应。又蒋匪中央银行副总裁刘攻芸，正计划在福建筹设一万锭之大规模纱厂。上海“ＣＣ”系之工矿银行，亦将在福州设立分支机构。
    ◇美钞在蒋区日益流行，现在上海的零售商，甚至房租，也越来越普遍的以美钞交易。至于赴美的旅客，则必须以美金才能买到船票或者飞机票。
    ◇四川匪省参议会驻委会于会议中透露：蒋匪到处搜刮粮食，蒋匪粮食部长俞飞鹏于三月间赴川，表面上说是从县公粮中拨售，但实际上却派人携大量蒋币在市场抢购粮食，因此俞匪所到之处，物价即随之飞涨。
