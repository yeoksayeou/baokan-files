Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 23rd: Yan Xishan's bandit "Personal Training Division," the 72nd Division, along with one mountain artillery regiment and one heavy artillery battalion, were completely annihilated by our army on the 21st in the Dapu area (north of Changlan), approximately 20 kilometers northeast of Jiexiu. Since our army recovered Lingshi on the 11th, the enemy troops in Jiexiu have been extremely panicked. Their 72nd Division retreated from Jiexiu towards Pingyao on the 21st. Our army intercepted them en route and completely annihilated them in just three hours, capturing over 4,000 enemy soldiers, killing or wounding over 2,000, and seizing 24 mountain guns and 12 heavy mortars. Detailed battle results are still being verified.
