　　Reprinting the Foreword to Chapter Two of "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder"
    Chairman Mao recently instructed all Party cadres to study Chapter Two of Lenin's book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder." He said, "Please read Chapter Two of this book, so that you will understand the need to eliminate some serious states of indiscipline, or anarchy, that now exist in our work." Chairman Mao's instruction is extremely important for our current great revolution. Due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army, our Chinese Communist Party is now in power in an area with a population of 160 million and is, to some extent, interconnected; there is no doubt that, with the continued victory of the revolution, our Party will become the leading party of a unified national people's democratic regime. However, in order to maintain the victories already won and continue to win victories, and to achieve victory on a national scale, centralized revolutionary discipline is of paramount and decisive significance. Regarding the Russian October Revolution, Lenin pointed out in Chapter Two of this book: "If we Bolsheviks had not enforced the strictest, truly iron discipline in our Party, if we had not been supported wholeheartedly and devotedly by the whole of the working class masses...we could not have maintained ourselves in power even for two and a half months, let alone two and a half years." The same is true of the Chinese revolution: if the Chinese Communist Party, which leads the Chinese revolution, does not have the strictest, truly iron discipline, and does not obtain the most loyal and wholehearted support of the broadest masses of the people, then we will not be able to achieve the victory of the national revolution, and we will not be able to maintain the victories already won.
    What Lenin said in this book is about the dictatorship of the proletariat. Today in China, we are not establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the people's democratic dictatorship. The historical difference between the content of this people's democratic dictatorship and the content of the dictatorship of the proletariat is: our people's democratic dictatorship is a new democratic revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses of the people, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. The social nature of this revolution is not to overthrow capitalism in general, but to establish a new democratic society and establish a state of joint dictatorship of various revolutionary classes; while the dictatorship of the proletariat is to overthrow capitalism and build socialism. Therefore, when we study this passage of Lenin's work, we should distinguish between the situation Lenin was in at the time and the situation we are in today. But we must know that in any genuine people's revolution in human history, the party leading the revolution must maintain extremely strict discipline and consolidate its ties with the masses in order to ensure that the masses of the people ultimately defeat the original oppressing class or foreign enemies. This principle is the same everywhere. Our Chinese New Democratic Revolution is to wage a long-term and selfless struggle against imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat-capital. International imperialism has enslaved China for a century through various direct and indirect, open and covert, bloody and bloodless methods, including military, political, economic, and cultural means. Imperialism is unwilling to see China have national independence. Japanese imperialism was just driven away, but American imperialism followed closely behind to implement new enslavement, and American imperialism is still supporting the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, preparing to let it re-enter China. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the feudal forces with a long historical foundation in China and the newly rising bureaucrat-capital, relying on the power of imperialism, are more and more adept at selling out the country from one generation to the next. They have used all the most bloody means to oppress the Chinese people's revolution, and in places where their forces have been crushed, they are still trying every means to stage a comeback, attempting to use the weakness of the scattered and isolated nature of the countryside and small producers to restore autocratic feudalism. Therefore, putting Lenin's words in our context, it means: the people's democratic dictatorship is necessary; it is impossible to defeat imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat-capital without a long-term, tenacious, fierce, life-and-death struggle. This war requires perseverance, discipline, firmness, unyieldingness, and unity of will.
    Upholding the Party's iron discipline and consolidating the Party's ties with the masses are Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent ideological and organizational principles. The resolution of the Gutian Conference in 1929 and the outline of "Combat Liberalism" in 1937 were written by Comrade Mao Zedong for this principle. In his famous rectification report, Comrade Mao Zedong first severely condemned the independence-seeking tendencies within the Party regarding the issue of Party style. In order to demand unified will, unified action, unified discipline, and centralized leadership within the Party, the Party Central Committee specially issued a decision on strengthening Party spirit in 1941; in 1942, the Party Central Committee issued a decision on the centralization of leadership in the anti-Japanese base areas; and the Seventh National Congress of the Party adopted the newly revised Party Constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the revision of the Party Constitution. All Party comrades must understand that if our Party cannot implement Comrade Mao Zedong's principles, if we cannot achieve unified will, unified action, and unified discipline of the entire Party, then we cannot achieve unified leadership over the revolutionary people of the whole country, we cannot overcome the various wavering tendencies within the revolutionary camp, we cannot defeat the various resistances of the enemy, and we cannot unite the 450 million people of China into a unified country. In the past, due to the long-term guerrilla warfare and the scattered environment of revolutionary base areas being divided into many independent units, with different enemy situations, terrains, and differences in political and economic conditions in each unit, we had to highly develop locality, highly develop the local autonomy of each independent unit, and thus highly promote the local initiative and creativity of each unit, overcome the extremely complex difficulties at that time, and push the Chinese revolution towards victory on a national scale. This was a completely correct and necessary policy at the time. However, precisely because of this, it has created a habit of decentralism or localism among many of our comrades, and has created some serious states of indiscipline or anarchy within the Party, which are wrong and harmful. The current situation has changed greatly. The national revolutionary situation requires that our entire Party and army be completely unified in all political, military, and economic policies, and the administrative system and administrative organs also require the gradual implementation of necessary and possible unification, to appropriately reduce the autonomy of various localities and military corps, and to unify all possible and necessary powers of the country under the leadership of the Central Committee, while in various regions and parts, they must be unified under the leadership of the Central Committee-entrusted leading organs—the Central Bureau and the Frontline Committee, in order to concentrate forces to carry out the national-scale liberation war and begin various new political, economic, and cultural constructions. Therefore, the policy of highly developing local autonomy, which was correct in the past, is no longer fully applicable; and those localism and states of indiscipline or anarchy in work, which were wrong in the past and still exist in many comrades, particularly demonstrate their serious harm to the current unified struggle, and they can no longer be allowed to continue to exist and develop. Facts have proven that the states of indiscipline or anarchy, independent actions and doing things in one's own way, localism and empiricism that existed in the Party in the past or have not been overcome now, have caused many serious losses to the people's revolutionary cause. Comrades who commit this kind of mistake mostly do not carefully study the Central Committee's lines and policies, do not earnestly implement them, and handle issues with policy and principle-related matters carelessly and without careful consideration, without asking for instructions beforehand or reporting afterward, so that they directly violate the decisions of the Party Central Committee and higher levels in some actions and propaganda, causing mistakes, and cannot be quickly corrected. This kind of lack of Party spirit and lack of discipline is not allowed by the interests of the Party and the people. As for those who intentionally seek independence from the Party, deliberately distort the instructions of the Central Committee, and change the nature of the Central Committee's policies in order to develop their personal or minority desires in their work, it is even more intolerable, needless to say. Now, reprinting this chapter of Lenin's work, comrades—especially all responsible comrades—must read it seriously and refer to the aforementioned works of Comrade Mao Zedong and the documents of the Party Central Committee, and carry out necessary and appropriate struggles to eliminate some serious states of indiscipline or anarchy in the current work. Under the current political situation, launching such a struggle to achieve true unity of the entire Party and army is absolutely necessary.
    Lenin pointed out in his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" that the discipline of the revolutionary party of the proletariat is guaranteed "first, by the class-consciousness of the proletarian vanguard and by its devotion to the revolution, by its perseverance, self-sacrifice and heroism. Second, by its ability to connect itself with, to keep in close touch with, and to some extent to merge itself with the broadest masses of toilers—primarily with the proletariat, but also with the non-proletarian toiling masses. Third, by the correctness of the political leadership exercised by this vanguard, by the correctness of its political strategy and tactics, provided that the broadest masses have been convinced by their own experience that they are correct." Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Chinese Communist Party has undergone 27 years of revolutionary fire, and has complex and rich revolutionary experience rare in world history, and has been proven by many works: it is fully equipped with these three conditions. There is no doubt that our entire Party's cadres will be able to accept Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, quickly overcome some serious states of indiscipline or anarchy, localism, or empiricism in the current work, and achieve complete unity of the Party's policies and discipline, in order to meet the victory of the national people's revolution, in order to unite all democratic classes and democratic parties under the bright banner of New Democracy, establish a democratic coalition government, defeat the reactionary forces, and unify the whole of China.

### 重印“左派幼稚病”第二章前言

　　重印“左派幼稚病”第二章前言
    毛主席最近指示全党干部研究列宁“左派幼稚病”一书的第二章。他说：“请同志们看此书的第二章，使同志们懂得必须消灭现在存在于我们工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态，或无政府状态。”毛主席这个指示，对于我们当前的大革命，极端重要。由于人民解放军的胜利，我们中国共产党已在拥有一万万六千万人口并在某种程度上联成一片的地区当政；没有疑问，随着革命的继续胜利，我们党行将成为统一的全国人民民主政权的领导政党。但是，要保持已得的胜利并继续胜利，和达到全国规模的胜利，集中的革命纪律，便具有头等的决定的意义。关于俄国十月革命，列宁在本书第二章指出：“如果我们布尔塞维克党内没有极严格的真正铁的纪律，如果我们党没有得到全体工人阶级群众最充分的和全心全意的拥护……，那末，布尔塞维克党，莫说两年半，便是两月半，也不能维持政权。”我们中国的革命在这样一点上也是同样的：如果领导中国革命的中国共产党没有极严格的真正铁的纪律，并取得最广大的人民群众最忠心的、全心全意的拥护，那末，我们就将不能取得全国革命的胜利，而且不能保持已得的胜利。
    列宁在本书中所说的，是关于无产阶级专政。今天在我们中国，则不是建立无产阶级专政，而是建立人民民主专政。这种人民民主专政的内容和无产阶级专政的内容的历史区别，就是：我们的人民民主专政是无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反帝反封建反官僚资本的新民主主义革命，这种革命的社会性质，不是推翻一般资本主义，乃是建立新民主主义的社会与建立各个革命阶级联合专政的国家；而无产阶级专政则是推翻资本主义，建设社会主义。所以，我们在学习列宁这一段著作的时候，应该分别列宁当时所处的情况和我们今天所处的情况。但我们必须知道：人类历史上任何真正的人民革命，那个领导革命的政党都必须保持极严格的纪律，巩固与群众的联系，才能保障人民大众最后战胜原来的压迫阶级或国外的敌人，这种道理到处都是一样的。我们中国的新民主主义革命是要和帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本作长期的奋不顾身的斗争的。国际帝国主义经过军事的、政治的、经济的、文化的各种直接的与间接的、公开的与隐蔽的、流血与不流血的方法，奴役中国已有百年之久，帝国主义是不愿意中国有民族的独立的。日本帝国主义刚被赶走，但美帝国主义就接着进来实行新的奴役了，而且美帝国主义还在扶助日本帝国主义的再起，准备让它重新进入中国。这是一方面。另方面，中国有长远历史基础的封建势力与近代新起的官僚资本，它们依靠帝国主义的力量，卖国的本领是一代赛过一代，它们用了一切最血腥的手段压迫中国人民的革命，而在它们的势力已被摧倒的地方　他们仍然千方百计地希望卷土重来，企图利用农村与小生产者的分散与孤立这一个弱点，而重新恢复专制封建主义。所以，把列宁的话放在我们这里来说，那就是：人民民主专政是必要的；如果不经过长期的、顽强的、激烈的、你死我活的战争，要战胜帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本是不可能的，这一战争要求坚忍、纪律、坚定、不屈不挠和意志的统一。
    坚持党的铁的纪律，巩固党与群众的联系，这是毛泽东同志的一贯的思想原则与组织原则。一九二九年古田会议的决议案与一九三七年“反对自由主义”的提纲，便是毛泽东同志为这种原则而写作的。毛泽东同志在有名的整风报告中，关于党风问题，首先严厉地斥责了党内的闹独立性。为要求党内统一意志、统一行动、统一纪律和集中领导，一九四一年党中央还特别发出关于增强党性的决定；一九四二年党中央又发出关于抗日根据地领导一元化的决定；党七次大会又通过了新修改的党章以及刘少奇同志关于修改党章的报告。全党同志必须明了，如果我们党不能实现毛泽东同志的这些原则，如果我们不能实现全党的统一意志、统一行动与统一纪律，那末，我们就不能实现对于全国革命人民的统一领导，就不能克服革命阵营内部的各种动摇，就不能战胜敌人的各种反抗，就不能把四万万五千万人民的中国团结成为统一的国家。过去由于长期游击战争与革命根据地被分割为许多独立单位的分散的环境，在各个单位中，又有着不同的敌情、地形和政治经济条件的差异，因此，我们就不能不高度地发展地方性，不能不高度地发展各个独立单位的地方自治权，因而也就高度地发扬了各个单位的地方积极性与创造性，克服了当时极为复杂的困难，把中国革命推向了全国规模的胜利。这在当时完全正确的和必要的方针。但是，正由于这样，也就在我们不少的同志中造成了一种分散主义或地方主义的习惯，造成了党内某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态，而这些则是错误的与有害的。现在的情况，已经很大地改变了。全国的革命形势，要求我全党全军在一切政治上、军事上、经济上的政策完全统一，而行政制度与行政机构也要求逐渐实行必要的与可能的统一，要适当地缩小各个地方的及各个兵团的自治权，要将全国一切可能统一的和必须统一的权力统一于中央的领导之下，而在各个地区和各个部分，则须统一于中央委托的领导机关——中央局及前线委员会的领导之下，以便集中力量进行全国规模的解放战争和着手政治、经济与文化的各种新建设。因此，在过去曾经是正确的高度发展地方自治权的方针，现在已经不能完全适用了；而那些在过去就是错误的在许多同志中存在的地方主义与工作中的无纪律状态或无政府状态，就特别表现其对于当前统一斗争的重大危害性，就更加不能容许其继续存在和发展。事实证明：党内过去存在或现在还没有克服的无纪律状态或无政府状态，各自为政和各行其是的地方主义与经验主义，已经给人民的革命事业造成了许多严重损失。犯这种错误的同志，大都是对于中央的路线和政策不细心研究，不认真执行，对于带政策性、原则性的问题，粗率地、不细心地擅自处理，事前既不请示，事后又不报告，以至在某些行动中和宣传中直接违反党中央和上级的决定，造成错误，而且不能迅速纠正。这种缺乏党性没有纪律的现象，是党和人民的利益所不能容许的。至于那些有意向党闹独立性的人，故意歪曲中央的指示，改变中央政策的性质，以便在工作中去发挥其个人的或少数人的欲望，其更不能容许，自不待说了。现在重印列宁这一章著作，同志们——特别是一切负责的同志们，必须认真阅读，并参看前述毛泽东同志的著作和党中央的文件，为消灭现在工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态而进行必要的与适当的斗争。在目前的政治形势之下，展开这样一个斗争，使全党全军达到真正的统一，乃是完全必要的。
    列宁在“左派幼稚病”一书中指出保障无产阶级的革命政党的纪律，“第一，是靠无产阶级先锋队的觉悟及其对于革命的忠心，靠它的坚忍、自我牺牲和英雄气概。第二，是靠它善于同广大的劳动群众——首先同无产阶级的群众，同时也同非无产阶级的劳动群众——联系，接近，而且在某种程度上，也可说和他们打成一片。第三，是靠这个先锋队所实现的政治领导的正确，它的政治的战略与策略的正确，而且要使最广大的群众根据自身的经验信服这种正确”。我们中国共产党在毛泽东同志的领导下，经历二十七年的革命烈火的锻炼，与世界历史上稀有的复杂而丰富的革命经验，并由许多工作所证明：它是充分具备了这样的三个条件的。毫无疑问：我们全党干部一定能够接受毛泽东同志的指示，迅速地克服现在工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态，或无政府状态，地方主义，或经验主义，而达到全党的政策与纪律的完全统一，以便迎接全国人民革命的胜利，以便在新民主主义的鲜明旗帜下，团结一切民主阶层和民主党派，建立民主联合政府，战胜反动力量，统一全中国。
