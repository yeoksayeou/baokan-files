　　Organizing the Poor to Help Themselves
  　Yuncheng Establishes an Orphanage for the Poor
    [Taiyue News] The Yuncheng Municipal People's Government is organizing impoverished citizens to engage in production for self-reliance, overcome difficulties, and has established an orphanage for the poor, taking in orphans, the poor, and the disabled. The citizens of Yuncheng, oppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs, are extremely impoverished. Although two relief loans have been issued since liberation, they have still not solved the difficulties of the impoverished citizens. Therefore, the government has adopted a policy of organizing production for self-reliance to completely overcome poverty. First, by lending salt, a portion of impoverished citizens are mobilized to borrow salt, go out to sell it, and exchange it for local necessities, earning a living through trade. On the other hand, citizens are mobilized to reclaim wasteland, which is tax-free for one year. In just over a month, 2,055 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. For the remaining orphans, the poor, and the disabled without labor, the municipal government has established an orphanage, which currently houses 85 orphans and poor people. A 78-year-old orphaned woman said: "The Eighth Route Army is truly a life-saving benefactor. If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army saving me, I would have died long ago."

　　组织贫民生产自救
  　运城设立孤贫院
    【太岳消息】运城市民主市政府组织贫苦市民生产自救，克服困难，并设立孤贫院，收养孤贫残废。在蒋阎匪帮压榨下的运城市民，贫困已极，解放后虽前后发放过两次救济贷款，但仍没有解决了贫苦市民的困难，所以政府采取了组织生产自救的方针，彻底克服贫困。首先以贷盐的办法，动员一部分贫苦市民贷盐，出外销售，换回当地必需品，往返贸易赚钱生活。另一面动员市民开荒，一年不负担。一月多工夫，已开了荒地二千零五十五亩，其余的无劳力的孤贫残废，市府设立了一个孤贫院，收容现有孤贫八十五人入院。七十八岁的孤老太太说：“八路军真是救命恩人，不是八路军救我，我早就死了。”
