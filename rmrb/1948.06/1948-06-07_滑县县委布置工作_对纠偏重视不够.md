【News from Ji-Lu-Yu】The Hua County Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres from various districts and discussed issues such as old organizations, old village cadres, and industrial and commercial policies. However, in the summary, the County Committee pointed out: the main task for this recent period is to unify the organization for wasteland elimination and wheat harvesting. The issue of compensating middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses should generally not be undertaken by lower levels for now; the county will first focus on key points, because it is feared that lower levels will cause chaos if they all start working on it, and they feel that their strength is too small to handle it. Therefore, the publicity should not be too loud either. After the meeting, when comrades working in Beiyangliu in the Third District held a mass meeting, they said: middle peasants are not allowed to be struggled against. At that time, two middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against went to him and said, "Doesn't what you said mean we were wrongly struggled against?" This comrade did not properly comfort them or admit the mistake, but said, "What's the big deal if you were wrongly struggled against? It's done." He did not pay enough attention to this issue. Even when reporting work to the district, he still did not know the names of these two middle peasants. A comrade working in Baliying in the Third District did not talk about the Party's policies at the mass meeting, but instead talked about issues of relationships between men and women, saying, "Men should not oppress women, and women should work hard, etc." This was not the urgent demand of the masses, so the masses were unwilling to listen, and some left. Based on the above situation, the Party's policies of compensating middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses, and resettling landlords and rich peasants, have not been well implemented in Hua County. It is hoped that the Hua County Party Committee will conduct an inspection and immediately and resolutely correct this attitude of delaying and shirking responsibility for policies and failing to implement them resolutely.

　　滑县县委布置工作
  　对纠偏重视不够
    【冀鲁豫消息】滑县县委召集各区干部会，对老组织老村干问题、工商业政策问题等也做了讨论，但在总结中，县委会指出：最近这一段主要是做统一组织灭荒、麦收工作，而对赔偿中农和工商业问题下边一般先不搞，由县里先搞重点，因为怕下边都搞搞乱了，觉得力量小也搞不过来，所以在宣传时也不能叫得太响了。会后，三区在北杨柳工作的干部同志开群众会时说：中农不准斗争。当时就有两个错斗中农找他去说：“你这一说不是错斗俺了吗？”这个同志也没好好给以安慰承认错误，反说：“错斗你啥法，斗了就斗了吧！”对这问题很不注意。直至到区汇报工作时，还不知道这两家中农的名字。三区在八里营工作的同志，在群众大会上不讲党的政策，又讲了些男女间的关系问题说：“男的不压迫女的，女的应好好做活等等。”这不是群众的迫切要求，所以群众不愿听，有些就走开了。根据以上情形看来，党的赔偿中农、工商业和安置地主富农等政策，在滑县没有很好的贯彻下去，希望滑县县委作一检查，立刻坚决的纠正这种对政策拖延推诿而不坚决执行的态度。（冀鲁豫分社）
