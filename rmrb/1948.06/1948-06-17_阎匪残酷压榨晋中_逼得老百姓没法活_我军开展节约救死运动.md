　　【Taiyue 13th Dispatch】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army operating in the Jinzhong plains witnessed the masses in the Yan-controlled area being exploited by the Yan bandits to the point of near starvation, and launched a thrift and life-saving campaign. In this area, the Yan bandits used the cruel method of "handing over grain as long as the chimney smokes," and the common people had long run out of grain, surviving by eating chaff and gnawing on tree bark. In some places, even the chaff was gone, the bark stripped, and many starved to death. The village of Haoling originally had more than twenty families, but now there is not a single one left. Sujia Village originally had more than fifty households, but now only two remain. Therefore, an emergency life-saving campaign was launched to save one person if possible, and one family if possible. Guo Haiwang, a platoon leader of the 72nd Detachment, and all the comrades in the platoon, seeing that their landlord, Lei Qitai's family, had been robbed of everything by the Yan bandits, and his wife and children were too hungry to get out of bed, proposed: "Each person eat one less mouthful of rice to save our own family," and sent not only the cooked rice they had on hand, but also the rice they had saved. Lei Qitai and his wife cried with gratitude, saying, "Each grain of rice is a drop of tears, we really can't bear to eat it! You carry grain on your backs to fight for the people, and still tighten your belts to save us, even if we die, we will never forget this kindness." The 719th Detachment divided food among the villagers and took out Jicha banknotes for relief. All the comrades of the 1st Company, in addition to saving clothing and money, took out 105 catties of millet at one time and distributed it to the starving people. As soon as the 1st and 2nd Battalions arrived in Dandan Village, they immediately sent people to Zhang Linquan's house, who was too hungry to get out of bed, to express their concern, and immediately distributed the saved grain to the homes of various famine victims. In addition, because the masses could not defecate after eating chaff and tree leaves, they sent doctors to give them enemas.
　　【Taiyue 13th Dispatch】The Pingyao Democratic Government allocates grain for disaster relief. The masses in the Ninth District of Pingyao have suffered from the exploitation of the Yan bandits, causing famine and death. The democratic government had secretly provided relief once before, and now it has allocated another 54 dan, 6 dou, and 7 sheng of grain. The relief has been distributed to 19 villages including × District ×× on May 20th, and the families of landlords, rich peasants, and puppet self-defense corps members who had nothing to eat or drink due to Yan bandit robbery have also received relief. The third batch of relief grain is being distributed.

　　阎匪残酷压榨晋中
  　逼得老百姓没法活
  　我军开展节约救死运动
    【太岳十三日电】在晋中平川活动的解放军某部，目睹阎管区群众被阎匪已压榨得快饿死完了，展开了节约救死运动。在这一带，阎匪使用了残酷的“烟筒冒烟就交粮”的办法，老百姓早已没一颗粮食，靠吃糠啃树皮过活。有些地方，连糠也吃完了，树皮也剥完了，饿死了不少。郝岭村原来有二十多家，现在一家也没有了。苏家庄原来有五十多户，现只丢下两户，所以展开了救活一人算一人，救活一家算一家的紧急救死运动。七二大队排长郭海旺和全排同志，见房东雷岐泰一家被阎匪抢的要什没什，老婆孩子都饿得下不了炕，就提出：“每人少吃一口饭救自家人”，将除做现成的米饭送去外，又把节约下的米送去。雷岐泰夫妇感动的哭着说：“一粒米一滴泪，真不忍心的吃呀！你们背上粮食为老百姓打仗，还拉紧裤带救我们，就是死了，这恩也忘不下”。七一九大队分饭给老乡吃，并拿出冀钞救济。一分队全体同志，除节约衣物钱钞外，一次就拿出了节约小米一零五斤分给挨饿的老百姓。一、二大队一到丹丹村，马上派人到已饿的不能下炕的张林泉家慰问，并马上把节约下的粮食分送到各饥民家中。另外又因群众吃糠秕树叶拉不出来，派医生给他们灌肠。
    【太岳十三日电】平遥民主政府拨粮救灾。平遥第九区群众，受尽阎匪的压榨造成饥荒死亡，民主政府曾拨粮秘密救济过一次，现又拨粮五十四石六斗七升。救济已于五月二十日分发×区××等十九村，其中因阎匪抢劫没吃没喝的地主富农伪自卫团家属也同样得到救济。现第三批救济粮正在设法发下去。
