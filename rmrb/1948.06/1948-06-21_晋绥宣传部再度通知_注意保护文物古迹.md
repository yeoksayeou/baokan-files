　　Jin-Sui Propaganda Department Issues Another Notice:
  　Pay Attention to Protecting Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th] The Propaganda Department of the CPC Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau issued another notice on June 13th regarding the protection of cultural relics, historic sites, books, and calligraphy. It stated briefly: Since the issuance of this notice last August, many places have paid attention to its implementation, but there are still many places that have not paid attention to it or have not fully implemented it. As a result, some valuable books are arbitrarily lost and left unmanaged, and some are arbitrarily taken for personal use or arbitrarily damaged. This is an irresponsible and unloving behavior towards the people and culture. In order to correct this undesirable phenomenon, the Party committees at all levels are specifically instructed to immediately and conscientiously designate special personnel to be responsible for sorting out, earnestly concentrating and preserving them. All staff members are called upon to immediately hand over any cultural relics they have taken privately to the designated responsible authorities, otherwise they will be treated as stealing fruits and given due punishment. Those who have arbitrarily damaged books and cultural relics should be severely criticized, and those with serious circumstances should be punished.

　　晋绥宣传部再度通知
  　注意保护文物古迹
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】中共晋绥分局宣传部，于六月十三日再度发出通知，保护文化古迹及书籍字画。略称：去年八月发布此项通知以来，许多地方是注意执行了，但仍有不少地方并未注意或未完全注意执行。以致某些宝贵图书任意散失，无人管理，并有任意据为已有或任意加以破坏者。这是对人民不负责任，对文化不加爱护的错误行为。为了纠正此种不良现象，特再责成各级党委，应即切实指定专人负责清理，认真集中保管。号召所有工作人员，凡有私拿文物者，应立即送交指定的负责机关，否则即以窃取果实论，予以应得处分。对曾经任意把图书文物弄坏者，应予以严格批评，情节较大者应予以处分。
