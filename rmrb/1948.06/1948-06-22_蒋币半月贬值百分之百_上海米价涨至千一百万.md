Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Compiling reports from various foreign news agencies and Chiang’s Central News Agency: The great surge in Shanghai commodity prices and foreign exchange, which began on the 5th of this month, is intensifying. The black market U.S. dollar was 1.9 million on the 14th, and broke through the 2 million mark at noon on the 15th, reaching 2.1 million. In half a month, the Jiang currency has devalued by 100%. At the same time, gold has soared to 110.1 million per tael. Accompanying the devaluation of the Jiang currency is the rising price of daily necessities, with many important commodities doubling in price. On the 15th, the wholesale price of top-quality rice reached a new record of 11 million per shi dan (approximately 100 kg), an increase of 1.1 million times compared to 10 yuan per dan in 1936. Soap, cigarettes, and other commodities all rose by 40% in a single day on the 16th. The popular American "Lucky Strike" brand cigarettes have risen to 500,000 per pack. The Nanjing puppet government is extremely panicked by this price fluctuation. Shanghai economic agents have been dispatched to search the market and arrest merchants for days (10 merchants were arrested on the 14th alone). The puppet government's Control Yuan stated in a resolution on the 16th: "The recent rise in prices is like a raging fire, affecting the whole country with panic." Another source: Kuomintang bureaucrats in Peiping, fearing the victorious advance of the North China People's Liberation Army, are scrambling to buy gold and cash to flee south. On the 14th, when the Shanghai U.S. dollar price was still 1.9 million, the U.S. dollar in Peiping had already risen to 2.02 million Jiang currency per dollar. According to a United Press report from Peiping on the 14th: It is estimated that in the past week, funds flowing from Peiping to Shanghai have reached 1 trillion yuan per day. Furthermore, it is widely rumored in Shanghai and Peiping that the Chiang Kai-shek government is rushing to print new banknotes with denominations of 700,000 and 500,000 yuan day and night, which will soon be circulated in the market, and it is expected that prices will rise even more sharply.
