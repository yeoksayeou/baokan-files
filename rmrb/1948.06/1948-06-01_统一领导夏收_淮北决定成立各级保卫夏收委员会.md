Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th. Wheat in Central China is ripening, and harvesting is imminent in various places. Due to favorable rainfall last winter and this spring, this year's summer wheat crop is generally abundant. In counties such as Ye Ting (i.e., Yancheng) and Jianyang (newly established county between Funing and Lianshui), each wheat ear has 60 to 70 grains. Government agencies in various regions are paying great attention to this year's summer harvest. Huaibei has decided to establish Summer Harvest Protection Committees at all levels to provide unified leadership for the summer harvest work. The Special Commissioner's Office has issued 80 million Hua Zhong currency in agricultural loans to solve the difficulties of the summer harvest in the west bank of Hongze Lake. The Third Branch of the Huaihai Trading Company has purchased 20,000 catties of broom branches (essential tools for wheat harvesting) from other areas. In addition to selling a portion at low prices, the remainder will be loaned to disaster areas such as Suqian and Tongyang (newly established county southwest of Shuyang). The Zhuhu District of Si (County) Su (Qian) County has established a summer harvest work team to help the masses organize mutual aid in various villages, aiming for quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick storage. It will also lead militia to protect the summer harvest. Disaster victims from the Huaihai area who had fled are returning home in large numbers. In the Zhuangwei District of Si(yang) Mu(yang), 962 disaster victims were happily sent off and assisted in returning home to harvest wheat within ten days.

　　统一领导夏收
  　淮北决定成立各级保卫夏收委员会
    【新华社华东二十九日电】华中麦熟，各地收割在即，由于去冬今春雨水调匀，今年夏麦普告丰稔。如叶挺（即盐城）、建阳（阜宁涟水间新设县）等县的麦穗，每个均有六十个七十颗麦粒。各地政府机关对今年夏收工作甚为重视。淮北已决定各级成立保卫夏收委员会，统一领导夏收工作。并由专署发放农贷华中币八千万元，以解决洪泽湖西岸地区夏收困难。淮海贸易第三分公司已向外地采购扫巴枝（麦收必需用具）二万斤。除一部分低价出卖外，其余贷给宿迁、潼阳（沭阳西南新设县）等灾区。泗（县）宿（迁）县朱湖区成立夏收工作队，到各乡帮助群众组织互助，以求快收、快打、快藏。并领导民兵武装掩护夏收。淮海区逃荒在外的灾民，正纷纷回家。泗（阳）沐（阳）庄圩区十天中就欢送并资助了九百六十二位灾胞回家收麦。
