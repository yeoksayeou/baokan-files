Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 9th. In order to implement the 1948 economic construction plan, rear organs and troops in various provinces of Northeast China have established public farms one after another, increased grain production, and created experience for the mechanized operation of agriculture in Northeast China. In the province of Hejiang, organs and troops have organized 29 specialized farms. Many farms are using tractors and new agricultural implements such as Kuali plows and Western plows. In total, there are 20 tractors, 1,904 draft animals, and 3,842 laborers on public farms throughout the province. It is planned to reclaim 9,674 hectares (1 hectare equals 10 mu), and together with 3,020 hectares of cultivated land, it is estimated that 38,780 shi of unhusked grain can be produced (grain that needs to be milled before eating, such as millet and rice, is called unhusked grain) (1 shi equals 500 jin). The Political Department of the Jilin Military Region has established farms in Yanji, Jiaohe, and Xiaofengman areas. The farm in Haiqinggou, Jiaohe alone, will reclaim more than 200 hectares. More than 1,000 students and staff of the Liaonan Jianguo College dredged the six-li-long Tongtian Ditch, which had been blocked for decades, in five days, allowing the accumulated water to flow into the sea, and turning the lotus swamp into fertile land, completing the initial project of the Jianguo Farm. In order to lay the production foundation for building a public farm and cultivate agricultural technical cadres, the Military and Political University of Ulanhot City, Inner Mongolia, has transferred 270 male and female students to reclaim a farm. Public farms established by various organs in Nenjiang Province have now cultivated 15,584 hectares of land. Various units directly under the Military Region collectively plant rice fields of 1,000 hectares, and it is estimated that 4 million jin of rice can be harvested in the autumn, which is enough to solve the food problem for two months. Fourteen units, including the Public Security Bureau and ten district governments of the Durbod Banner government, planted 557 hectares of land, which can produce 532,700 jin of various unhusked grains and 269,000 jin of vegetables. In addition to self-sufficiency in food for two months, there will be a surplus of more than 450,000 jin of grain, plus an income of more than 30 million yuan from sideline production such as salt and alkali production, which can be used to solve the annual office expenses, subsidies, heating, and other living expenses. In Zhaodong County, Songjiang Province, in addition to each staff member planting two mu of vegetable land, various organs collectively manage farms cultivating 1,371 hectares of land. The urban government of the county also jointly operates a farm with private industrial and commercial enterprises, with 180 hectares of land, which is currently being rushed for planting. The Public First Farm and the Sun Jia Yuanzi Farm in the Songzhan central area have completed the sowing of more than 100 hectares of land. According to the large-scale agricultural economy of Northeast China, which has always been very developed, after the land reform, although the large cultivated land originally belonging to landlords and old-style rich peasants has been equally divided, large-scale public farms and private capitalist-style large farms can still be developed now because Northeast China is special and there is a lot of wasteland in North Manchuria.

　　增产粮食创农业机械化经验
  　东北机关部队纷建公营农场
    【新华社东北九日电】东北各省后方机关部队，为执行一九四八年经济建设计划，纷纷建立公营农场，增进粮食生产，并为东北农业机械化经营创造经验。合江全省机关部队，已组织专门农场二十九个，许多农场都使用着拖拉机和夸犁、洋犁等新式农具。总计全省公营农场共有拖拉机二十架，耕畜一千九百零四匹，劳动力三千八百四十二名。计划开荒九千六百七十四垧（每垧十亩），连同熟地三千零二十垧，估计可产皮粮（如谷子、稻子等需碾过始能吃者称皮粮）三万八千七百八十石（一石五百斤）。吉林军区政治部，在延吉蛟河、小丰满一带，分别建立农场、仅蛟河海清沟一处农场，即将开荒二百余垧。辽南建国学院千余员生，五天内疏通六里长淤塞数十年之通天沟，使积水流入海中，莲花沼烂泥变成良田，完成了建国农场的初步工程。内蒙乌兰浩特市军政大学，为打下建设公营农场的生产基础及培养农业技术干部，已抽调二百七十余名男女学员开垦农场一所。嫩江全省各机关建立的公营农场，现已耕种土地一万五千五百八十四垧。军区直属队各部集体种稻田一千垧，预计秋后可收稻四百万斤，足够解决两个月食粮。杜皮伯特旗旗政府公安局及十个区政府等十四个单位，种地五百五十七垧，可产各种皮粮五十三万二千七百斤，蔬菜二十六万九千斤，除自给两月食粮外，尚可余粮四十五万余斤，加上熬盐熬硷等副业生产收入三千余万元，可供解决全年办公杂支津贴烤火等生活费用。松江省肇东全县，除每个工作人员种菜地两亩外，各机关并集体经营农场耕地一千三百七十一垧，该县城区政府，另与私营工商业合资经营农场有地一百八十垧，现正抢种中。公营第一农场及宋站中心区孙家园子农场，已有一百余垧地播种完毕。按东北大农业经济，历来甚为发达，土地改革后，原属地主和旧式富农的大耕地，虽已平分，但因东北特别，北满荒地甚多，故大规模的公营农场以及私营的资本主义式大农场，现在仍可发展。
