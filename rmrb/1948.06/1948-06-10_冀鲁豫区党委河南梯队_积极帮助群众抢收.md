The Henan Contingent of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee
Actively Helps the Masses with the Harvest

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] The Henan General Branch reported: During the heroic offensive launched by our combat troops against the enemy, all personnel of the Henan contingent of the District Party Committee actively helped the masses harvest wheat. On the 2nd of this month, after the office convened a meeting to help the masses with the wheat harvest, everyone's enthusiasm was extremely high. The guard company immediately organized a production committee and a political work group, on the one hand, conducting in-depth investigations into households that lacked labor or had difficulties harvesting wheat at home due to combat duty, preparing to provide assistance, and leading everyone to publicize our Party's various policies and current affairs during the wheat harvest. The next day, they started working, wielding their sickles skillfully, some even cutting faster than the old farmers. The soldiers did not rest even when blisters formed on their hands. When they returned from the fields, they put down their guns and helped the masses thresh the grain. In order to harvest, thresh, and store quickly, many comrades got up before dawn to work. According to statistics from the 3rd and 4th, the guard company alone harvested 165 mu. During the wheat cutting, they also paid attention to: (1) Not only should they cut quickly, but also cleanly, with short stubble. (2) Young women should follow behind to pick up the wheat, and no mischievous remarks should be made. (3) Take care of farm tools and do not damage other people's sickles. Everyone held meetings every night to review whether they had followed the above regulations. The masses often enthusiastically offered the comrades cigarettes, but they were all refused. Everyone regarded helping the masses with the wheat harvest as their own responsibility. Under the armed protection of our army and with the help of the organ troops, the local masses are carrying out the wheat harvest safely and quickly, and a joyful atmosphere of unity between the army and the people permeates everywhere.

　　冀鲁豫区党委河南梯队
  　积极帮助群众抢收
    【冀鲁豫消息】河南总支社报导：区党委河南梯队全体人员，于我战斗部队向敌展开英勇进攻之隙，积极帮助群众抢收小麦。本月二号，办公室召开了帮助群众麦收会议后，大家情绪异常高涨。警卫连当即组织了生产委员会、政工小组，一面深入调查没劳力或因出战勤家里收麦困难的户，准备进行帮助，领导大家在麦收中宣传我党的各种政策和目前时事。第二天开始进行，大家熟炼的挥起镰刀，有的比老农民割的还快，战士们手上磨了泡也不休息，从地里回来的时候，大家把枪一放，又帮助群众打起场来，为了快收、快打、快藏，许多同志天不明就起床去劳动起来。据三、四两日的统计，光警卫连就割了一百六十五亩，在割麦中，并且注意了（一）不仅要割的快还要割的干净，麦茬要短。（二）有青年妇女在后边跟着拾麦，不说调皮话。（三）爱护农具，不毁坏人家的镰。大家每天晚上开会检讨，看是否按以上规定做了，群众常常热诚的要给同志们烟吸，均被拒绝。大家把帮助群众麦收，都看成是自己应有的责任。当地群众在我军武装保卫下又得到机关部队帮助劳动，安全而迅速的进行着麦收，到处洋溢着军民团结的欢快空气。
