　　【Chahar News】Lai Zhuo County summarized the spring plowing and sowing work, and determined that the focus of production before the summer solstice is to eliminate wasteland and protect the wheat harvest. There are several reasons for the wasteland in the county: (1) Wasteland before land reform: mainly the land of fleeing landlords, which was abandoned because the rent was too high and the masses dared not cultivate it; most of these lands are bad lands; (2) Bad lands that could not be divided during the land reform were abandoned; (3) Lands that had been distributed but were abandoned because no one cultivated them. The methods for eliminating wasteland: (1) In consolidated areas, the farmers' association is responsible for quickly distributing the land. At the same time, according to the specific situation of each village, the reasons for the wasteland should be found. If the wasteland is due to burdens or low yields, the yields should be reduced according to the actual situation (Editor's note: The burden score should be determined according to the average yield of the land in the current year, and should not be too high or too low.) For the rest, which are abandoned because they cannot be divided, the village should find a special person or group to cultivate them collectively, or the militia should cultivate them. At the same time, farmers should be educated to apply more manure and cultivate carefully, so that bad land can also increase production. If there is really too much land, it can be appropriately adjusted to other villages. (2) Border areas: we must implement rushing planting and rushing harvesting, and combine labor and military affairs with militia joint defense. The surplus land can be collectively cultivated by the militia for combat rations. (3) Guerrilla areas: For the land of fleeing landlords, it can be cultivated by the village workers, with collective cultivation and collective distribution of grain. For the land where the landlord has not fled, the landlord himself should find someone to cultivate it, and at the same time strive for the fleeing landlord to return to the village to cultivate the land. Regarding the issue of protecting wheat: wheat protection organizations should be established, preferably mutual aid groups based on households. In addition, a militia joint wheat protection team should be organized, and a contracting team should be established to organize young and middle-aged people from various villages in the mountains to contract wheat pulling outside the mountains. Villages with late ripening can contract work in villages with early ripening, so as to "harvest one piece as it ripens". At the same time, a transportation team should be organized to transport wheat for military, industrial, and martyrs' families without labor, and women and children should be organized to go to the fields to cut wheat, dry wheat, drive pack animals, and deliver food. The slogan of "quick harvest, quick threshing, quick storage" was also put forward, calling on everyone to strictly prevent the enemy from looting wheat.

　　涞涿布置夏至前生产
  　消灭荒地保护麦收
    【察哈尔讯】涞涿县总结了春耕播种工作，确定夏至前的生产重点是消灭荒地和保护麦收。该县荒地原因共有以下几种：（一）土改前荒的：主要是逃亡地主的地，因为租子重，群众不敢种而荒的，这些土地多是坏地；（二）土改中分不出的坏地荒了的；（三）已分出去没有人种而荒了的。关于消灭荒地的办法：（一）巩固区，由农会负责赶快把地分下去，同时应根据各村具体情况，找出荒地原因如因负担和因产量低而荒的，则根据实际情况，降低产量（编者按：应根据土地当年平均产量定负担分数，不应过高或过低。）其余因分不出去而荒的，由村里找出专人或小组集体来种或归民兵种。同时要教育农民，多上粪，精耕细作，坏地也能增加产量。如果真是土地多，可以设法向外村适当的调剂。（二）边缘区：要实行抢种抢收和劳武结合民兵联防，多余的土地可让民兵集体种做战粮用。（三）游击区：对于逃亡地主的地，可由村工种上，集体种地、集体分粮。地主没逃跑的地，由地主本人来找人种上，同时争取逃亡地主回村种地。关于护麦问题：应建立护麦组织，最好成立以户为单位的互助小组。另外要组织民兵联防护麦队，成立包工队，组织山里各村的青壮年到山外包工拔麦。熟的晚的村可到熟的早的村包工，做到“熟一片、拔一片”。同时还要组织运输队给军、工、烈属无劳动力的运麦，组织妇女儿童到场里割麦、晒麦、赶驮子、送饭等，还提出“快收、快打、快藏”的口号，号召大家严防敌人的抢麦。
