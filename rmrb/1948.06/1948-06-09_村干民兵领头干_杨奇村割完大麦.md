　　Village Cadres and Militia Lead the Way
  　Yangqi Village Finishes Harvesting Wheat
    [Yexian News] In Yangqi Village, forty-five people, including representatives for production and famine relief, village cadres, militia, middle peasants, and women representatives, gathered on the 23rd of last month. The work team first exposed the enemy's wheat-snatching plot and mobilized everyone to harvest and protect the wheat. Then, everyone started sharing their thoughts and difficulties. Some poor peasants and hired laborers said, "People eat noodles in the fifth lunar month! We can't stand the hunger in the fifth lunar month." Middle peasants expressed fear of both enemy theft and being divided by others. They weren't clear on the policies. The whole village was anxious and afraid of the enemy looting, demanding leadership but not knowing who was in charge in the village. Village cadres feared making mistakes and pushed everything to the poor peasants and hired laborers, who felt too isolated and burdened. The militia also mentioned family difficulties and not being able to work in the fields. Later, a discussion was held, and it was decided to allocate existing fruits and communal land to the landless poor to solve their difficulties. For the middle peasants, it was proposed that middle and poor peasants are one family, uniting to protect the wheat and collectively achieve liberation. Regarding the militia's production difficulties, the method of combining labor and military service was proposed: "Grab a gun when the enemy comes, grab grain when the enemy leaves. Taking the sickle is being a civilian, taking the gun is being a soldier." Their living difficulties would be resolved from the fruits, along with the poor peasants and hired laborers. For the village cadres, it was suggested: "Discuss everything democratically with the masses, and honestly serve the masses, and you won't make mistakes." Finally, the work team called for meritorious service in protecting the wheat, which changed the mood of both cadres and the masses.
    Then, various mobilization meetings were held, ideological obstacles were resolved, and methods for organizing leadership and harvesting and protecting wheat were discussed. After three days of preparation and coordination, the masses voluntarily found partners and formed groups (ten to fifteen households), and selected thirty-three representatives (one from each group) to form a wheat protection committee, establishing a leading core for the whole village.
    While preparing the organization, concrete methods for harvesting and protecting wheat were discussed: 1. The self-defense team should stand guard at night, and the militia should patrol outside to watch the wheat, prevent the enemy, prepare hemp ropes, and set up landmines to fight the enemy. 2. Groups should help each other, with more people helping fewer people, less wheat helping more wheat, and those with livestock helping those without livestock. Wages should be determined by the masses themselves. 3. In emergencies, the upper half of the wheat should be harvested first for quick transport, threshing, and grinding. 4. Contact old neighbors (joint defense) to fight together when the enemy comes.
    With such organization and arrangements, the masses, under the new leadership, acted. In three days, they generally finished harvesting the wheat. The masses themselves proposed slogans such as: "Strike first to gain the upper hand, early work doesn't lose out" and "Men, women, old, and young, all work together, no idlers at home." They are now preparing to harvest the wheat.

　　村干民兵领头干
  　杨奇村割完大麦
    【邺县消息】杨奇村生产渡荒代表、村干、民兵和中农、妇女代表等四十五人，于上月廿三日集会，工作组先揭发了敌抢麦阴谋，并动员收麦保麦后，大家就开始谈心事，提困难，一部分贫雇说：“人家熬五月吃面哩！俺熬五月不当饥。”中农提出前也怕，后也怕，怕敌抢，又怕被别人分了。对政策不摸底，全村群众都提心吊胆，怕敌人抢，要求领导，但又不知村里谁当家，村干部提光怕犯错，有事就推给贫雇，贫雇代表又觉太孤单，担子重，民兵也提出家里困难，又不能上地生产。后就展开讨论，对没麦的贫雇，大家商定将现存果实及社地等分给他们解决困难。对中农大家提出中贫农是一家，团结起来共同保麦，共同翻身等。对民兵生产困难，大家提出劳武结合办法：“敌来拿枪，敌去拿粮，拿镰是民，拿枪是兵。”对其生活困难，决定从果实中和贫雇一起解决。对村干提出：“有啥事和群众民主商量，老老实实给群众办事，不会错的。”最后工作组又号召保麦立功，这样干部群众情绪都改变了。
    接着又召开了各种动员会，解决了思想障碍，商量了组织领导和收麦保麦办法。经过三天酝酿串通，群众自愿的找对象，碰成小组（十家到十五家），选出了三十三个代表（每组一个），组成了保麦委员会，树立了全村领导核心。
    在酝酿组织中，同时讨论出收麦保麦的具体办法：一、自卫队夜间把岗站好，民兵出外流动看麦子，防敌人，并准备好麻绳，安好地雷，敌来就打。二、以组为单位，互相帮助，人多的帮助人少的，麦少帮麦多的，有牲口帮助没牲口的，工资由群众双方自定。三、在紧急情况下，割麦先割上半截，往回拿的多干的快，碾打也快。四、联系老邻家（联防）敌来一齐打。
    经过这样组织和安排，群众在新的领导下行动起来，在三天内大体割完了大麦，群众自己提出：“先下手为强，早些动工不吃亏”。“男女老少齐动手，家里不要有闲人”的口号，现正准备割小麦。
