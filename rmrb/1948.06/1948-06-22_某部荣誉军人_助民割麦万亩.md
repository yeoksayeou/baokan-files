[News from Ji-Lu-Yu Front] More than 2,000 meritorious servicemen from a certain field army's honor school helped the masses in 20 villages in the驻地 area harvest more than 10,000 mu of wheat; and also helped those masses who had no livestock transport the wheat to the threshing ground. Even comrades who were first-class disabled, although they had one arm amputated, also participated in the summer harvest. Two one-armed people helped each other, one using his only hand to grab the wheat, and the other using his only hand to cut it, moving the old woman who said, "You shed blood on the front lines and became disabled, but you still come to the rear to help us harvest wheat, truly a people's army." When harvesting wheat, some of the masses bought cigarettes and eggs and sent them to the fields, but the meritorious servicemen politely declined. Meritorious servicemen who were blind cooperated with comrades on crutches to do propaganda work, reporting victory news everywhere. In four days, the Fourth Battalion alone, with 432 people, harvested 438 mu of wheat for 77 military dependents, 250 mu of wheat for 44 worker dependents, 21 mu of wheat for 5 martyrs' dependents, 207 mu of wheat for 32 full-time laborers, and 1,562 mu of wheat for 392 other poor and middle peasants. A total of 2,022 people from the school's directly subordinate hygiene team and the first, second, third, and fourth battalions harvested a total of 10,080 mu of wheat. After the wheat harvest, the relationship between the army and the people became even closer. Pang Jinli, a member of the Pangzhuang masses, said, "We will never forget your spirit." The village chief of Dizhuang Village expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the entire village, saying, "If the meritorious servicemen have any difficulties in the future, we will definitely do our best to help solve them."

　　某部荣誉军人
  　助民割麦万亩
    【冀鲁豫讯】野战军某部荣校荣誉军人两千多人，帮助驻地二十个村的群众割麦一万多亩；并帮助无牲口的群众运到场上。一等残废的同志们虽然有一个臂子已经锯掉，亦参加夏收。两个独臂的人互助，一人用独手抓住麦，一个用独手割，感动的老大娘说：“你们在前方流血，成了残废，到后方还帮助我们收麦，真是人民的队伍。”割麦时有的群众买了香烟、鸡蛋送到田里，荣军们都婉谢了。双目失明的荣誉军人则配合架双拐的同志做宣传工作，到处报告胜利消息。四天时间，只四大队四百卅二人，便给军属七十七户割麦四百三十八亩，给工属四十四户割麦二百五十亩，给烈属五户割麦二十一亩，给常备民工三十二户割麦二百零七亩，给其他贫雇中农三百九十二户割麦一千五百六十二亩。校直卫生队及一、二、三、四大队共二千零二十二人，共割麦一万零八十亩。割麦后军民关系更进一步亲密，庞庄群众庞金李说：“你们这种精神咱永远忘不了。”棣庄村长代表全庄群众表示万分感谢，说：“今后荣军有什么困难，我们一定尽量帮助解决。”
