Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 29th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch from Prague reports that the Czech election campaign is flourishing. Scheduled for the 30th of this month, the unified candidate list put forward by the parties and organizations of the National Front was formally announced after the candidate nomination deadline on the 10th. It includes 920 representatives of the laboring people from all walks of life, such as workers, staff members, farmers, handicraft workers, teachers, doctors, and writers, of whom 710 are Czech and 150 are Slovak. Because the opposition parties in each electoral district did not obtain the required endorsement application of one thousand citizens for nomination, they did not put forward even one candidate. Therefore, all 300 members of parliament will be produced from the candidates of the National Front. However, to ensure that all citizens can freely express their will, those who do not approve can cast blank votes. The complete list of voters was also finally approved by the Central Election Commission of the Parliament on the 15th. The total number of registered voters nationwide is 8,005,877, of which 6,098,036 are Czech voters, producing 229 members of parliament, and 1,907,851 are Slovak voters, producing 71 members of parliament. The total number of voters is 422,000 more than in the last general election on May 26, 1946.
