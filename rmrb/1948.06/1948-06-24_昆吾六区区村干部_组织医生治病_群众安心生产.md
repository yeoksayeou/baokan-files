[Ji Lu Yu News] District and village cadres in the Sixth District of Kunwu County deeply understand the suffering of the masses, actively lead the effort to overcome disasters and epidemics, stabilize social order, and unite all classes in production. At the beginning of last month, each sub-district held village branch cadre meetings to discuss how to stabilize social order and allow the masses to produce with peace of mind. The discussion concluded that some farmers burn incense to pray for children and seek medical treatment. On the one hand, it is necessary to conduct education, and on the other hand, to organize and mobilize doctors to actively serve the masses, help them solve the difficulties of medical treatment, and provide solutions to those who believe in witch doctors and superstition based on their specific difficulties, so as to make their thinking conscious. On the other hand, expose deceptive propaganda to render their deceptive tactics ineffective. At the same time, rectify the militia, strengthen anti-espionage work, and mobilize the masses through disaster relief and production. After the meeting, various organizations in each village held meetings to conduct propaganda and education. This work has achieved remarkable results. For example, Song Jingshi of Cao Village had been a vegetarian for 20 years, quit last year, and started again this year. She was very poor and had nothing to eat this spring. Village cadre Fan Tonghai talked to her three times and provided her with 25 jin of rice. Later, she requested the village cadres to hold a mass meeting where she frankly told everyone the inside story of her superstition. She said that she had spent a lot of money eating vegetarian for 20 years, but it didn't stop her from being hungry. She also introduced Shao Jingkun, a scholar from Dazhai, who, because of eating vegetarian, stopped eating grains and only drank jujube soup every day. After eating for more than 20 days, he became emaciated and looked inhuman. Having no other way, he ate white flour to nourish himself, but he couldn't recover and died. She said that superstition is all in vain and she is determined to quit. In addition, a meeting was convened with 54 doctors from the entire district to organize a medical committee, with doctors Guo Jinxing and Chen Binggang serving as the director and deputy director, respectively. They regularly studied diseases, exchanged experiences, provided effective prescriptions, and overcame various difficulties in treatment. To facilitate patients in finding doctors in a timely manner, the medical committee immediately issued a notice announcing the establishment of the medical committee. The notice listed the names, specialties, and villages of all the doctors in the district, and each village posted a copy. If the masses had an illness and wanted to invite a certain doctor, they could go to the location indicated on the notice to invite them. In addition, during this period, a total of 3,274 jin of relief rice and 3,259.5 liang of beans were distributed, providing relief to 333 poor farmers, 215 middle farmers, and resettling more than 60 landlords and rich peasants. After this period of work, by the end of May, the difficulties of the masses such as disaster and epidemic diseases have been initially overcome, rural order has been stabilized, and the masses can produce with peace of mind.

　　昆吾六区区村干部
  　组织医生治病
  　群众安心生产
    【冀鲁豫讯】昆吾县六区区村干部，深入了解群众疾苦，积极领导克服灾荒疫病困难，使社会秩序安定，各阶层团结生产。上月初，各小区召开村支干会，讨论如何安定社会秩序，使群众安心生产。讨论结果，认为农民中有烧香求子，看病的，一面要进行教育，一面要组织和发动医生积极为群众服务，帮助群众解决治病困难，对巫神及迷信的人要根据他们的困难分别给以解决，使之思想自觉；另一方面要揭发欺骗宣传，使其欺骗手段无效。同时整顿民兵，加强锄奸工作，并通过救灾生产，发动群众。会后，各村都开了各种组织的会议，进行宣传教育。这一工作获显著成绩。如曹庄宋井氏吃斋已二十年，去年反了，今年又吃起来。她很穷，今春没啥吃，村干范同海去和她谈过三次话，救济了她二十五斤米，后来她要求村干部开了个群众大会，她很坦白的把迷信内情向大家都说了，她说吃斋二十年，花了不少钱，也挡不住挨饿。她并介绍了大砦秀才邵景坤，因吃斋，以后不吃五谷杂粮了，每天只吃枣汤水，吃了二十多天，饿的面黄肌瘦，不象人样，没有法了，又吃白面保养，没养过来就死了。她说迷信都是白费，自己一定反了。此外，并召集全区五十四个医生开会组织了一个医务委员会，由医生郭晋兴、陈冰刚分任正副主任，经常研究病症，交流经验，提供效方，克服治疗中的各种困难。为了便利于病者及时找到医生，医务委员会当即印发启事，宣布医委会成立；并在启事上把全区医生姓名、专长、所住村、都列在后面，每村都贴一张，群众有了病，想请那样的医生，就可按启事上所指地点去请。另外在这一时期，共发救济米三千二百七十四斤，豆三千二百五十九斤五两，共救济贫农三百三十三户，中农二百一十五户，安置了地主富农六十余户。经过这一段工作，到五月底群众灾荒与疫病等困难已初步克服，农村秩序已经安定，群众都能安心生产了。
