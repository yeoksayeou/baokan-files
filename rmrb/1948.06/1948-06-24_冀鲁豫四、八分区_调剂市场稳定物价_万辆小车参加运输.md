　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] The fourth and eighth districts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan suffered severely from Chiang Kai-shek's attacks, floods, and droughts, causing a sharp rise in prices. According to investigations, the most rapid increase in the nine days from April 17th to 25th was in grain prices. Taking the price on April 1st as the base, the highest regional increase index for red sorghum was 72%, while the lowest was 28%. However, due to our correct handling of foreign trade, active organization of transportation, support for production, and adjustment of goods, we overcame the chaotic market conditions. Starting in April, the leadership distributed 10 million jin of grain and cotton to the masses through the market, solving the difficulties in people's livelihoods and means of production. Approximately 300,000,000 yuan (冀钞, Hebei currency) of currency was used to absorb the production output of the masses through the market. A large-scale transportation effort was launched for disaster victims, with 10,000 small carts and 500 large carts, involving about 20,000 people, participating in transportation and adjustment work. In the grass hat industry, due to the correct handling of foreign trade from the beginning, braid prices gradually increased. From February to the end of May, the increase index rose from 53% to 78%, and now it has risen to 100.5%. Under the correct trade policy of supporting production and adjusting the market, prices in the two districts have now stabilized, with grain prices falling by 400 to 1,000 yuan per dou. According to a survey of Yuan Village Market in Nanle County, the highest price of wheat from April 20th to 26th was 7,700 yuan per dou. After April 26th, prices declined daily, falling back to 6,800 yuan by May 10th, and this level is maintained now (June 8th).

    【冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫四、八两分区由于蒋、水、旱灾严重的打击，引起物价猛烈上涨。据调查自四月十七日至二十五日九天中，以粮价上升最为急剧，若以四月一日物价作基数计算，以红粮为例，最高地区上升指数为百分之七十二，低者亦达百分之二十八。但由于我正确的掌握了对外贸易，并积极组织运输，扶植生产，调剂货物，克服了市场上的混乱状态。自四月份起，领导上透过市场，将一千万斤粮食、棉花分散到群众的手里，解决了群众生活资料与生产资料的困难，约卅万万元（冀钞，下同）的货币又通过市场将群众的生产成品吸收上来，并发动大规模的灾民运输，有一万辆小车、五百辆大车，约两万人参加运输调剂工作。在草帽工业方面，由于开始正确的掌握了对外贸易，辫价逐渐上涨，自二月份起至五月底止，上升指数已由百分之五十三升到百分之七十八，现在已上升至百分之一百点五。在扶植生产调剂市场的正确贸易工作方针下，目前该两分区物价已趋平稳，粮每斗下降四百元至一千元。据南乐县元村集的调查，麦子价格在四月二十日至二十六日最高价每斗七千七百元，二十六日后逐日下降，至五月十日已回跌至六千八百元，现在（六月八日）仍保持此数。
