Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 28th: TASS reports: The Soviet Military Administration in Germany, in order to prevent the chaos in currency circulation caused by the issuance of new currency by the US, British, and French occupying authorities, took the following measures starting at midnight on the 18th: (1) Suspension of passenger train traffic between the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the western occupation zones. (2) Prohibition of all automobiles and horses from the western occupation zones from entering the Soviet zone. (3) Water transportation vehicles from the western occupation zones to the Soviet zone or from the Soviet zone to the western occupation zones must obtain permission from the Chief of the Transportation Department of the Soviet Military Administration and undergo thorough inspection before being allowed to proceed. (4) Personal passes issued by the western occupation zones to the Soviet occupation zone are invalid. (5) Freight trains may continue to pass without hindrance, but must undergo thorough inspection. (6) The above instructions take effect from midnight on June 18.

At the same time, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, at the request of the German Democratic People, and decided to issue new currency in the entire territory of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Greater Berlin area starting on June 24, namely, issuing the original "Reichsmark" and "Rentenmark" with special markings. Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces, issued this order on the 23rd. The order pointed out that the currency reform implemented unilaterally in the western occupation zones destroyed the uniformity of the monetary system and completed the division of Germany. The situation seriously endangers the normal restoration and development of a peaceful economy in Germany as a whole. The Soviet Military Administration has to take emergency measures to protect the interests of the German people and to protect the economy of the Soviet zone and Greater Berlin. Therefore, it accepted the proposal of the German Economic Commission (this commission is composed of representatives of various German democratic parties and is authorized by the Soviet Military Administration to handle economic matters related to the Soviet zone) to implement currency reform in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. The order explained that the currency reform in the western occupation zones is beneficial to foreign and German monopoly capital; while the currency reform in the Soviet zone is in line with the interests of the working people, in line with the principles of social justice, and the needs of the early revival and development of Germany's peaceful economy. It will minimize the possible losses suffered by the working people. The order stipulates that only the new currency of the Soviet zone can circulate in the Greater Berlin area, which belongs to the Soviet zone and constitutes an economic part of the Soviet zone. The exchange of currency will be carried out from the 24th to the 28th; the ratio is ten to one. In order to protect the interests of the working people, bank deposits within 100 marks can be exchanged at a rate of one to one; within 1,000 marks, it can be exchanged at a rate of five to one; farmers who obtained land during the land reform will also have their loans exchanged at a rate of five to one. During the currency reform, the salaries of all workers and staff, pensions, scholarships, and the prices of all commodities and all expenses will remain at their original levels.

　　防止西德新币引起混乱
  　苏占区采紧急措施
  　同时实行货币改革
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社报导：德境苏联军政府，为了防止因美英法占领当局发行新币而引起的货币流通的混乱，特于十八日午夜起采取下列措施：（一）停止德境苏占区与西部占领区之间的客运火车交通。（二）禁止所有西部占领区的汽车和马匹进入苏战区。（三）自西部占领区至苏占区或自苏占区至西部占领区的水路运输工具，必须获得苏联军政府运输处处长的许可及彻底检查后始允放行。（四）个人持有西部占领区所发至苏联占领区的通行证无效。（五）运货火车得继续通行无阻，但须经过彻底检查。（六）上述训令自六月十八日午夜起生效。
    同时，德境苏占区军政府应德国民主人民的要求，并决定自六月二十四日起，在德境苏占区及大柏林区域的整个领土内发行新币，即发行加上特别印记的原有“帝国马克”和“仑吞马克”，苏军总司令索柯洛夫斯基元帅于二十三日颁布此项命令。命令指出：西部占领区单独实行的货币改革，破坏了币制的统一，并完成了德国的分裂。局势严重地危及全德和平经济的正常恢复与发展，苏联军政府不得不采取紧急措施，以保护德国人民的利益，并保护苏占区及大柏林的经济。因此，接受了德国经济委员会（该委会系由德国各民主党派代表组成，由苏联军政府授权处理有关苏占区的经济事宜）所提的在德境苏占区实行货币改革的建议。命令说明：西部占领区的货币改革，对外国及德国的垄断资本有利；而苏占区的货币改革，则符合于劳动人民的利益，符合于社会正义的原则及德国和平经济尽早复兴和发展的需要。它将使劳动人民可能受到的损失减至最小限度。命令规定：只有苏占区的新币，才能在属于苏占区并在经济上构成苏占区之一部分的大柏林区域流通。货币的兑换，将在二十四日至二十八日内实行；比率为十比一。为了保护劳动人民的利益，凡银行储款在一百马克以内者，得以一比一兑换；在一千马克以内者，得以五比一兑换；土地改革期中得到土地的农民，其所获贷款亦按五比一兑换。在货币改革中，一切工人和职员的薪资、养老金、奖学金以及一切商品的价格和一切费用，将保持原有水平。
