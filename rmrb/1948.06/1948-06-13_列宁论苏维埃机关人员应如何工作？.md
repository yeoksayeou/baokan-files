Xinhua News Agency editor's note: This article was translated from the Soviet News on January 21, 1946. All cadres of our party, army, democratic government, and people's organizations who can read should carefully study this article and use the Leninist work standards described in it to examine our own work. We know that Chairman Mao and our Party Central Committee are constantly requiring us to carry out our work according to this Leninist standard, and Chairman Mao's own work style is the best model for us in this regard. With the rapid development of the people's revolutionary war, our party and government must now be directly responsible for the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people. Whether there is sloppiness, procrastination, lack of efficiency, lack of discipline, and lack of enthusiasm and responsibility for the interests of the masses in each of our tasks will affect and even determine the happiness, suffering, good fortune, disaster, life, and death of the people. A serious and repeated struggle against such bureaucracy, in order to greatly improve our work in all aspects, is one of the important goals of the past year and the continued party rectification, government rectification, military rectification, and the Three Check-Ups movement. Therefore, it is beneficial and timely to publish and study such an article now. Of course, some of the specific requirements mentioned in this article cannot be fully realized or need to be lowered in the countryside where new means of transportation are lacking. But even so, we must not use these as excuses to forgive all the bad phenomena in our work that are not caused by this and are not impossible to overcome. The scattered and stagnant small-scale production system in the countryside is an important foundation and cover for the spread of bureaucracy, which is precisely what our comrades working in the rural environment should be vigilant about. Therefore, we should pay more attention to and constantly carry out the struggle against bureaucrats. Chairman Mao said: We should sweep the floor and wash our faces frequently to avoid these political dust and political microorganisms from blinding and eroding the minds of our comrades and the body of our party, which points out this necessity. As for our comrades who still maintain those rural bureaucratic habits that must be firmly opposed after entering the city, it is even more intolerable. The text of this article is as follows:

The Soviet system guarantees the greatest possibility for all laborers in our country to participate in the management of the country. Lenin regarded this as the strength of our state organs and believed that it made it possible for the activities of our state organs to be continuously improved. The Soviet organs created by Lenin and Stalin serve the interests of the people and consolidate the power of our socialist country.

From the very beginning of the existence of the Soviet state, Lenin attached great importance to improving the work of the Soviet regime organs. He strived to maximize the attraction of the broadest working class to consciously participate in the work of the Soviet organs.

Lenin attached great importance to the State Supervision People's Committee.

In April 1919, in a short note to Stalin regarding the reorganization of the State Supervision People's Committee, Lenin put the following tasks first as the urgent tasks of the reorganized State Supervision People's Committee. These tasks were to investigate the sufferings of the people, fight against procrastination, and use revolutionary means to fight against all kinds of malfeasance.

Lenin demanded that we resolutely, quickly, and meticulously implement the decrees and instructions of the Soviet government.

Lenin warned: "The smallest illegal act, the smallest violation of Soviet order, is already a loophole that the enemies of the workers immediately take advantage of..."

While striving for people to abide by revolutionary laws, Lenin fiercely fought against bribery. He called this behavior the cursed legacy of the Tsarist system.

On May 2, 1918, the Moscow People's Court tried several bribery cases. The court proved the defendants guilty but gave very light sentences. Lenin was furious at such a verdict. He wrote in a letter:

It is shameful for communists and revolutionaries not to execute bribe-takers but to give such ridiculously weak and light sentences. Such bribe-taking comrades must be handed over to public opinion and expelled from the party... A few days later, Lenin wrote a letter to the People's Committee of Justice, in which he suggested: "Immediately and quickly submit a bill stipulating that the punishment for bribery (accepting bribes, offering bribes, and other bribery behaviors, etc.) should be at least ten years of imprisonment and ten years of hard labor."

Lenin repeatedly strived for the simplification of state organs, demanded great efficiency in work, and resolutely fought against bureaucrats who replaced vigorous work style with a cold and dilatory attitude.

In order for everyone to strictly abide by revolutionary order and laws not only in cases involving national interests but also in cases involving personal interests, Lenin conducted a systematic and tenacious struggle. On January 18, 1919, he wrote a letter to the Director of the Administration of the People's Committee, saying:

"I order you to immediately give me all the reports of accusations against government organs and personnel received by the Administration of the People's Committee. Written accusations should be reported within 24 hours, and oral accusations should be reported within 48 hours."

"The Administration should have a special registration for these accusations, and at the same time, the Director of the Administration's office should be given close supervision to implement my decisions on these accusations."

Checking execution - "checking what is actually done" and being good at selecting personnel - these are the basic conditions for the victory of the Soviet state organs in their work.

Lenin believed that accurately delineating the responsibilities of each staff member and determining "the clear responsibility that everyone holding any Soviet position should have for performing certain clear and unambiguous tasks and actual work presented to him" was one of the basic conditions for correctly organizing the work of the Soviet state organs.

Whether for the organs or for individual staff members, Lenin always demanded independent and responsible work. He sharply criticized the phenomenon of incompetence and unwillingness to be responsible for work. He resolutely fought against any individual staff member or organ that attempted to submit problems that could have been solved independently to the People's Committee or the Federal Labor and Defense Council.

One of the most important requirements that Lenin repeatedly put forward to organs and individual staff members was to carry everything through to the end and achieve practical results.

He repeatedly taught us to strive to complete the work entrusted to us; taught us not to stop in the face of difficulties and not to invoke superficial reasons that hinder smooth work. He said: We must be good at revising ten times, redoing ten times, but in any case, we must achieve our goal. If we hit a wall at the beginning, then start over again, and keep doing it until we achieve the goal—Lenin taught us this way.

He sharply criticized and ridiculed laziness, carelessness, doing things casually, and liking to dabble in everything in the world but accomplishing nothing.

Lenin demanded accuracy, organization, and discipline in work. He used his own example to show the best model of high labor discipline and the ability to correctly allocate work and manage his own working time.

No one understood the value of time as much as he did and knew how to cherish it. Not a minute of Lenin's time was wasted. He never showed impatience, but he never procrastinated. In the morning, he always arrived at a certain time, received guests, presided over meetings, read reports, and gave instructions based on them, wrote articles, and guided the work currently underway. And always went home for meals and rest at exactly four o'clock. He returned to his office at six o'clock or five thirty, always full of energy and creative enthusiasm, and worked until late at night.

Lenin was not only good at cherishing his own time but also good at cherishing other people's time. Meetings led by Lenin, no matter how many people were present, always started on time. The names of the committee members of the People's Committee and the Federal Labor and Defense Council who were late were recorded in the minutes according to Lenin's instructions, and it was recorded who was late for how many minutes. If they were repeatedly late without reason, Lenin would reprimand the latecomers, warning that if they did it again, it would be published in the newspaper.

Lenin never made those who came to see him at the appointed time wait for him. In rare cases, when he had to delay for a few minutes while discussing work with other staff members who had arrived earlier, he would call the secretary at the appointed time and ask him to apologize to the waiting comrades and ask them to wait a little longer.

Once, during the meeting time of the People's Committee, Lenin accidentally passed by the room of the rapporteur and saw that the whole room was filled with tired people, sitting in the smoky haze, some playing chess, some reading newspapers, waiting to be called to the meeting.

Lenin immediately gave the secretary a series of concrete instructions, asking him to arrange the order of summoning the rapporteurs. Moreover, on October 13, 1921, he gave the Director of the Administration of the People's Committee a written instruction, asking him to carefully arrange an order of summoning the rapporteurs. He wrote:

"Now the rapporteurs generally have to wait for several hours before being summoned to the meeting."

"This is ugly and barbaric,"

"It must be done so that the rapporteurs are summoned at a certain hour."

The meetings of the People's Committee and the Federal Labor and Defense Council presided over by Lenin were conducted in model-like silence and with the undivided attention of all attendees. These meetings were a true school of political education for the practical leaders of the Soviet organs.

When presiding over these meetings of the People's Committee and the Federal Labor and Defense Council, Lenin always tried to make the discussions brief and the speakers speak clearly and concisely. Lenin considered long-winded speeches at meetings to be a pointless waste of time.

For such reports, Lenin usually started from the back, looking at the practical suggestions. If he found these suggestions to be realistic, he would read the entire report.

No matter how great the national cause he was undertaking, Lenin always found the time and energy to solve simple and minor problems.

In a letter published in the "Worker's Daily" on the first anniversary of Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin pointed out this outstanding characteristic of Lenin. He wrote: "Never refuse small tasks, because small things are the root of big things - this is one of Lenin's important legacies."

Lenin combined his own instructions and requirements for personal examples with cultivated habits and attitudes at work. He was accustomed to solving problems realistically and independently, accustomed to being responsible for the work he performed, and accustomed to implementing the resolutions and decrees passed by the government accurately and appropriately. At the same time, in the work of the Soviet regime organs, he established revolutionary discipline and order, and he patiently and tenaciously trained a group of new-type state staff.

In his last two articles, written during his serious illness (December 1923), Lenin once again specifically discussed the issue of creating model state organs. In his article "Better Fewer, But Better," Lenin instructed:

"We must in any case set ourselves the task, first of renewing our state apparatus; secondly, of learning; thirdly, of learning and of learning again, and then of seeing to it that learning shall not remain a dead letter, or a fashionable catch-phrase (which, as we know only too well, happens very frequently with us), that learning shall really become part and parcel of our very being, that it may actually become a fully verifiable constituent element of social life." Lenin also criticized and condemned lengthy written reports.

More than 20 years have passed since Lenin wrote these brilliant words. During this period, the state organs of our great motherland have greatly grown, and the scope of its work has become more complex, more arduous, and more diverse.

The Soviet organs victoriously fulfilled the various tasks it shouldered during the peaceful period of socialist construction in our country.

Our state organs showed a particularly high degree of organization, discipline, and efficiency during the Great Patriotic War against the German aggressors. Our national economic and administrative people's committees and our entire state apparatus carried out huge and difficult organizational work during the war days and ensured everything that the Red Army needed to smash the enemy.

Now, after the victorious conclusion of the Patriotic War, in the new period of peaceful construction, new and huge tasks have emerged before our country, which put more demands on the work of our entire state apparatus.

Comrade Molotov said: "We have no more important task than to consolidate our victory, which we have achieved in an indomitable struggle. This victory has paved the way for a new great prosperity of our country and for a further improvement in the living standards of our people. Never before have we seen such magnificent prospects for socialist construction and such a huge increase in the strength of the Soviet Union."

In order to carry out these tasks, it is necessary to further improve the work of the Soviet organs, so that it can work "like a good clock, in harmony and accurately" (Stalin) even under new peaceful conditions.

　　列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作？
    伏蒂也娃  作
    新华社编者按：这篇文章是从一九四六年一月二十一日苏联消息报译出的，我们党的、军队的、民主政府的和人民团体的一切能读的干部，都应好好研究这篇文章，并且用这篇文章中所说的列宁式的工作标准来检查一下我们自己的工作。我们知道，毛主席和我们的党中央，是经常要求我们按照这种列宁式的标准来进行工作的，而毛主席自己的工作作风正是我们在这一方面的最好模范。随着人民革命战争的迅速发展，我们的党和政府已经必须对成万万人民的日常生活直接负责了。我们的每一项工作中，是否存在着潦草拖延，缺乏效率，缺乏纪律性，对群众利益缺乏热情和责任心等官僚主义现象，都会影响甚至决定人民的苦乐祸福和生死；向这种官僚主义作严肃的和反复不断的斗争，以便把我们各方面的工作大大改进一步，是过去一年间和今后继续整党整政整军和三查运动的重要目标之一。因此，现在发表和学习这样一篇文章，是有益的和适合时宜的。当然，这篇文章里所说的某些具体要求，在缺少新式交通工具的农村中，是不能完全实现或者是需要降低标准的。但是即令如此，我们也必须不把这些作为借口来原谅我们工作中的那些并非由此产生和并非不可能克服的一切不良现象。农村中散漫而停滞的小生产制度，乃是官僚主义蔓延的重要基础和掩护物，这正是我们在农村环境中工作的同志们所应当警惕的。因此，我们应当更加注意地与经常地来进行反对官僚主义者的斗争。毛主席说：应该经常扫地和洗脸，以免这些政治的灰尘和政治的微生物来蒙蔽和侵蚀我们同志的思想，和我们党的肌体，就正是指出了这种必要性。至于在我们同志进入城市以后，如果仍然保守着那些本来就必须坚定反对的农村式的官僚主义习惯，就更是不可容许的了。本文如下：
    苏维埃制度保证我国全体劳动者有最大的可能去参加国家的管理，列宁把这看作是我们国家机关的力量所在，认为这使我们国家机关的活动有不断改进的可能。列宁和斯大林所创立的苏维埃机关是为人民的利益服务的，为巩固我们社会主义国家的威力服务的。
    列宁从苏维埃国家存在的最初日子起，就非常重视改进苏维埃政权机关的工作。他力求最大限度地吸引最广泛的劳动者阶层，自觉地参加苏维埃机关的工作。
    列宁非常重视国家监察人民委员会。
    一九一九年四月，列宁在给斯大林的短扎中，讲到国家监察人民委员会的改组时，把下列几项工作提到第一位，作为改组后国家监察人民委员会的迫切任务。这几项工作就是四出调查民间的疾苦，与拖延现象作斗争，用革命手段与各种渎职作斗争。
    列宁要求我们毅然决然地迅速地，丝毫不苟地执行苏维埃政府的法令和指示。
    列宁警告说：“最小的非法行为，对苏维埃秩序的最小的破坏，已经是一个空子，而为劳动者的敌人所马上利用。……”
    列宁在力求人们遵守革命法律时，严厉地同贿赂行为作斗争。他把这种行为叫作沙皇制度的该咒诅的遗物。
    一九一八年五月二日，莫斯科人民法庭曾审理几个受贿者的案件。法庭证明了被告有罪，却判决很轻。列宁对这样的判决，大为震怒。他在一封信中写道：
    不把受贿者枪毙，而给了这样开玩笑似地软弱而轻微的判决，这对共产党人和革命者乃是可耻的行为。这类受贿的同志，必须交给舆论裁判，并开除出党……　　过了几天，列宁写信给司法人民委员会，在信上他建议道：“立刻赶快提出一个法案，规定对于贿赂（收贿赠贿以及其他贿赂行为等等）的惩罚，应该至少是十年监禁和十年苦役。”
    列宁再三力求国家机关的精简，要求工作上的巨大效率，并且坚决同那些以冷淡的拖延态度来代替活泼的工作作风的官僚主义者作斗争。
    为了要大家不仅在牵涉国家利益的场合下，而且在牵涉个人利益的场合下，都严格遵守革命的秩序和法令，列宁曾进行了有系统的顽强的斗争。一九一九年一月十八日，他写信给人民委员会管理处长说：
    “我命令你立即把人民委员会管理处所收到的一切对政府机关及人员的控诉报告给我，其中书面的控诉限于廿四小时内报告，口头的控诉则期于四十八小时内报告。”
    “管理处对这些控诉应有特别的登记，同时对管理处办公室主任应给以缜密的监督，以执行我对这些控诉的决定。”
    检查执行——“检查实际上所做的事情”及善于挑选人员，这是苏维埃国家机关在工作上胜利的基本条件。
    列宁认为确切地划定各个工作人员的职责，确定“每个担任苏维埃任何职务的人，为执行一定的明白而不含糊地摆在他面前的任务和实际工作所应有的明确责任。”是正确组织苏维埃国家机关工作的基本条件之一。
    不论对机关也好，对个别工作人员也好，列宁始终要求独立和负责的工作。他尖锐地斥责那种对工作无能和不愿负责的现象。凡是个别工作人员及机关，企图把自己本来可以独立解决的问题，提交给人民委员会或联邦劳动国防会议去解决，他都坚决地与之作斗争。
    列宁向机关及个别工作人员所一再提出的最重要的要求之一，就是要把每件事做到底，做到有实际的结果。
    他再三教训我们，要为完成所委托的工作而奋斗；教训我们不要停留在困难面前，不要援引阻碍顺利工作的表面上的理由。他说：必须善于成十次地修正，成十次地重作，但是无论如何要达到自己的目的。开始碰了壁，那就重新来过，这样一直到达到目的为止——列宁这样教导我们。
    他尖锐地斥责和嘲笑懒惰，粗枝大叶，对工作随随便便，对世上一切都喜欢沾一手，而又一事无成。
    列宁向大家要求工作上的精确性，组织性和纪律性。他以自己的例子，表现了高度劳动修养的最好模范，表现了善于正确地配备工作，善于支配自己工作时间的本领。
    谁也不象他那样懂得时间的宝贵，并善于珍惜它。列宁没有一分钟是白白过去的，他从没有表现过急燥，但他也从没有拖延过。早晨，他总在一定的时刻来到，接见客人、主持会议、阅读报告，并依据它们作指示，写文章，指导当前进行的工作。而总是在正四点时回家吃饭和休息。他回到自己的办公室是六点或五点半，总是充沛着精力和创造的积极性，一直工作到深夜。
    列宁不仅善于珍惜自己的时间，而且也善于珍惜别人的时间。列宁领导下的会议，不管到会者有多少人，总是准时开会。人民委员会及联邦劳动国防会议迟到委员的姓名，按照列宁的吩咐，都登上了记录簿，并且证明谁迟到了几分钟。如果无故一再迟到，列宁就斥责迟到者，警告说：再犯就登报。
    列宁从不使那些在指定时间来见他的人等候他。在稀有的场合下，当他同其他先来的工作人员谈论工作而不得不延迟几分钟时，他就在指定的时间把秘书叫来，要他去向等候的同志们道歉，请稍微等一下。
    有一次在人民委员会开会的时间，列宁偶然经过汇报人的房间，看见整个房子塞满了疲倦的人们，他们坐在烟雾迷濛中，有些在下棋，有些在看报，等着叫到会上去。
    列宁马上对秘书作了一系列具体的指示，要他排好召集汇报人的次序。不仅如此，一九二一年十月十三日，他给人民委员会管理处长一个书面的指示，要他周密地排好一个召集汇报人的次序，他写道：
    “现在汇报人一般总要等几个钟头才被召集开会。”
    “这是丑恶和野蛮，”
    “必须做到使汇报人在一个一定的钟点被召集。”
    列宁所主持的人民委员会及联邦劳动国防会议的会议，都是在标本式的肃静和全体出席者聚精会神之下进行的。这些会议对于苏维埃机关的实际领导者，乃是真正的政治教育学校。
    列宁在主持人民委员会及联邦劳动国防会议的这些会议时，总是尽力使讨论简短，使发言者讲话明白而且扼要。会议上的长篇大论，列宁认为是无谓地浪费时间。
    对于这样的报告，列宁平常是从后边从实际的建议看起，如果发见这些建议是实事求是的，他才把整个报告看完。
    不管他所担负的国家事业多么巨大，列宁总找得出时间和精力来解决简单的和细小的问题。
    斯大林同志在列宁逝世第一周年纪念日发表于“工人报”的一封信上，指出了列宁的这个卓绝的特点。他写道：“从来也不拒绝细小的工作，因为小事是大事的根——这就是列宁的重要遗训之一。”
    列宁把他自己的指示，要求个人例子同工作上的有修养的习惯和态度结合在一起，他惯于实事求是地和独立地解决问题，惯于对所执行的工作负责，惯于把政府所通过的决议与法令确切和恰当地付诸实施。同时，在苏维埃政权机关工作中，树立起革命的纪律和秩序，他耐心而又顽强地锻炼了一批新型的国家工作人员。
    列宁在其写于重病时期（一九二三年一二月间）的最后两篇文章里，再度专门论述创立模范的国家机关的问题。列宁在“宁缺毋滥”这篇文章里指示道：
    “我们无论如何要向自己提出革新我们国家机关的任务，第一是学习，第二是学习，第三是学习，然后就来检查，使得科学在我们这里不再是死板的教条和时髦的漂亮话（用不着掩饰，它在我们这里却常常是如此），使得科学实际地化为血肉，完全而且真正地变成生活的组成因素。”列宁也批评和责难长篇的书面报告。
    自从列宁写下这些卓越的话锯之后，已经过去二十余年了，我们伟大祖国的国家机关在这个期间，是大大地增长了，它的工作范围是更加复杂了，更加艰巨了，更加多种多样了。
    苏维埃机关胜利地执行了它在我国社会主义建设的和平时期中所担负的各项任务。
    我们的国家机关在反对德国侵略者的伟大爱国战争时期，表现了特别高度的组织性，纪律和效率。我们各国经济的和行政的人民委员会以及我们全部国家机关，在战争日子里进行了巨大而又困难的组织工作，并且保证了红军为粉碎敌人所需要的一切。
    现在在爱国战争胜利结束以后，在新的和平建设时期，我们国家面前出现了新的巨大的任务，这就对我们全部国家机关的工作提出了更多的要求。
    莫洛托夫同志说：“我们没有比巩固我们的胜利更为重要的任务了，这个胜利是我们在不屈不挠的斗争中所取得的。这个胜利为我们国家新的伟大的繁盛，为我国人民生活水平并进一步的提高开辟了道路。在我们面前展示社会主义建设如此规模宏伟的远景，以及苏联力量如此巨大增涨的可能性，过去从来还不曾有过。”
    为了执行这些任务，需要进一步改进苏维埃机关的工作，使得它在新的和平条件下也工作得“象一个好的时钟一样，合拍而且准确。”（斯大林）
