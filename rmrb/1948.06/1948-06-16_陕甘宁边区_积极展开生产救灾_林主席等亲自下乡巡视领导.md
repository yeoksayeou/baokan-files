　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
  　Actively Launches Production for Disaster Relief
  　Chairman Lin and Others Personally Go to the Countryside to Inspect and Lead
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th] The production and disaster relief work in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is actively underway under the concrete leadership of responsible comrades at all levels who are going deep into the grassroots. In mid-April, Chairman Lin Boqu personally went to the Suide Sub-region to inspect production and disaster relief. Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CPC, and Ma Wenrui, Minister of Organization, also successively went to the Yan'an, Sanbian, and Longdong sub-regions to inspect production leadership. Influenced by their leadership style of going deep into the rural areas, cadres from the sub-regions down to the district and township levels have entered the rural areas one after another, contacting the masses and strengthening the concrete leadership of production work. Yang Heting, Commissioner of the Suide Sub-region, and Bai Zhimin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee, led work teams to various counties at the end of May to lead production and rush the transportation of relief grain. Hu Zongyan, the head of Heshui County in Longdong, went to the countryside to help families draw up production plans, helped farmers weave manure baskets and plant trees, taught the masses how to spin wool, and organized women to weave. Wangjiaping, a model village in Suide, under the leadership of Wang Debiao, a labor hero of the Border Region, and Wang Jizhou, the village director, has completed the spring plowing. The village has now organized seven weeding mutual aid teams to start weeding since the 18th of last month, and has drawn manpower and livestock to take on outside work. The Secretary of the Yanchuan County Committee of the CPC led cadres to the countryside to help the masses solve production difficulties. In addition to allocating relief grain, the county also mobilized the masses to mutually adjust more than 600 dan of grain through low-interest loans. By the end of May, the county's plan to sow 11,700 hectares of early-maturing crops had exceeded 36.2 percent. The Dingbian County Government of the Sanbian Sub-region concretely inspected the production of one village in three districts and four townships, and found that the production leadership in the village was still at the level of general appeals. The masses still had problems such as not understanding our party's policy of encouraging labor to get rich, unfair burdens, and lack of grain and fodder. These problems were only corrected with the personal help of various levels.

　　陕甘宁边区
  　积极展开生产救灾
  　林主席等亲自下乡巡视领导
    【新华社西北十三日电】陕甘宁边区生产救灾工作，在各级负责同志深入下层具体领导下正积极展开。四月中旬林伯渠主席曾亲赴绥德分区检查生产救灾，中共西北中央局副书记马明芳，组织部长马文瑞亦相继分赴延属三边陇东各分区巡视生产领导。在他们深入农村的领导作风影响下，自分区直至区乡各级干部均纷纷进入农村，联系群众，加强生产工作的具体领导。绥德分区专员杨和亭，及中共地委副书记白治民，均于五月底率工作队分赴各县领导生产及赶运救济粮。陇东合水县长胡宗彦下乡帮助各家订立生产计划，并帮农家编粪筐栽树，教群众纺毛，组织妇女纺织。绥德模范村王家坪在边区劳动英雄王德彪和村主任王继周领导下，春耕已告一段落，现该村已组织了七个锄草变工组　从上月十八日开始锄草，并抽出人力畜力向外揽工。延川中共县委书记率干部下乡帮助群众解决生产困难，该县除拨发救济粮外，并以低利借贷方式，发动群众互相调剂了六百多石粮食，至五月底该县播种早熟作物一万一千七百垧的计划，已超过百分之三十六点二。三边分区定边县政府具体检查了三区四乡一个村的生产，发现该村生产领导还停留于一般号召上面，群众中还存在着不了解我党鼓励劳动致富政策，负担不够公平以及缺粮缺草料等问题，经各级亲自帮助才得到纠正。
