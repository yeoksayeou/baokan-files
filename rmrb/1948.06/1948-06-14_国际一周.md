　　International Week
    May 30th to June 6th
    The overwhelming victory of the Czechoslovak National Front in the parliamentary elections on May 30th brought encouraging news to the world. The election was conducted in an atmosphere of freedom. The mass deployment of military police, as seen in the so-called elections in Italy and the South Korean puppet election, was nowhere to be found. This was a first in Czech history. People could freely cast a vote in favor of the National Front candidates or freely cast a blank vote. In this truly democratic election, 6,420,000 of the 7,190,000 voters elected the 300 candidates of the National Front into parliament. The reactionaries, who two months ago still believed they had American bosses to rely on and dared to conspire to usurp power, have now been completely defeated. The victory of the Czech people in the general election will "guarantee the democratic development of Czechoslovakia towards socialism" (National Front Declaration).
    The new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, where the people's power has triumphed, are continuing to strengthen their political and economic ties with each other. On May 29th, Poland and Bulgaria signed a 20-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, the twelfth such treaty signed between the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and between these countries and the Soviet Union in the past six months. Previously signed were the treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania, Yugoslavia and Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, Hungary and Romania, the Soviet Union and Romania, the Soviet Union and Hungary, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, the Soviet Union and Finland, and Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria (mutual assistance treaties between the Soviet Union and Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia and Albania were signed in previous years). These treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between the Eastern European countries are a strong bulwark for defending peace and democracy, not only within Eastern Europe but also worldwide. Before and after the signing of the Polish-Bulgarian treaty, Poland and Bulgaria signed an economic cooperation treaty and a trade agreement, and Romania and Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia signed one-year trade agreements respectively, and Czechoslovakia and Poland and Hungary and Poland completed treaty negotiations respectively.
    On June 3rd, the Soviet government announced that, effective July 1st, it would reduce Finland's war reparations to the Soviet Union by 50 percent. This will alleviate Finland's financial burden by approximately $75 million. Stalin stated at a banquet after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish treaty: The Soviet Union and Finland should "create a tradition of friendship with each other; the Soviet side has taken the initiative to contribute to this." The Finnish people excitedly cheered this action by the Soviet Union. Workers held mass meetings everywhere, writing letters of thanks to Stalin and sending representatives to express their gratitude to the Soviet ambassador.
    The Soviet Council of Ministers consecutively awarded Stalin Prizes twice in one week, with 164 recipients. The scope of the awards covered scientific creations, inventions, and improvements in production methods, from the discovery of fifteen previously unknown subatomic elements to the organization of a Stakhanovite movement. "All inventions and improvements have greatly increased the labor productivity of the Soviet people and strengthened the economic and defense power of the Soviet Union." (TASS)
    In the United States, the massive tide of protests against the passage of the "Mundt-Nixon Bill" continued to rise over the past week. During the hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the bill, this bill, which Wallace called a "declaration of war on the rights of the American people," was universally opposed by representatives from all walks of life in the United States. Representatives of progressive groups denounced the bill as creating a "fascist legal system." Representatives of some conservative groups also criticized the bill as violating the Constitution. Foster and Wallace separately declared to the Senate that if the bill became law, the CPUSA and the Progressive Party would refuse to recognize it and would openly oppose it. Senate officials revealed that they had received tens of thousands of letters and telegrams opposing the bill, and representatives from various groups, totaling 4,000 people, requested time to go to the Senate to testify against it. Outside Congress, 6,000 representatives from all over the country, under the slogan of "March on Washington," held a grand demonstration in front of the White House to oppose the Mundt-Nixon Bill. All these actions, as Foster said, showed that "people who cherish freedom and seek peace are unwilling to hand over to Wall Street what they have seized from the Nazis."
    While the so-called Six-Power Conference (led by the United States, with the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg participating) was being held in London, plotting to split Germany, a petition movement "demanding German unification" was held within Germany. The signing began on May 23rd and will end on June 13th. In just ten days, 12.5 million of the more than 17.5 million people in the Soviet-occupied zone have participated in the signing. As of May 31st, 150,000 people in the Ruhr area occupied by France had also signed. The US and French occupying authorities in Germany, fearing the strong will that "almost every German wants his country to remain unified" (Associated Press), actually dispatched armed police, even with police dogs, to hunt down Germans who signed, carrying out frantic persecution.

　　国际一周
    五月三十日至六月六日
    捷克斯拉夫民族阵线在五月三十日国会大选中，获得压倒胜利的事件，给全世界带来了鼓舞人心的捷报。选举是在自由的空气中进行的。最后在意大利的所谓选举与南鲜伪选中，大批出动军警的情形是看不到的。在捷克历史上，这还是第一次。人民可以自由投一张拥护民族阵线候选人的票，也可以自由投一张空白票。在这种真正的民主选举之中，七百十九万投票者，有六百四十二万人把三百名民族阵线的候选人选入了国会。两个月以前，还自以为有美国老板做靠山而胆敢阴谋篡夺政权的反动派，现在已完全失败了。捷克人民在大选中的胜利，将“保证捷克走向社会主义的民主发展”（民族阵线宣言）。
    人民力量得到胜利的东欧新民主国家，正继续加强彼此间在政治与经济上的连系。五月二十九日，波保又签订了二十年友好合作互助条约，这是东欧新民主国家之间以及各该国与苏联之间，半年以来签订的第十二个同类条约。前此签订的是南保、南罗、南匈、保罗、保阿、匈罗、苏罗、苏匈、苏保、苏芬、捷保友好合作互助条约（苏波、苏捷、苏南与南阿之间，前几年已订有互助条约）。东欧各国的这些友好合作互助条约，不但在东欧范围内，而且在世界范围内，都是保卫和平民主的坚强保垒。在波保条约签订的前后，波保签订了经济合作条约与换货协定，罗保、南捷分别签订了一年换货协定，捷波与匈波分别完成了缔约谈判。
    苏联政府于六月三日宣布自七月一日起，将减少芬兰对苏战争赔偿百分之五十，三百七十万人口的芬兰，将因此减轻其财政负担约七千五百万美元。斯大林在苏芬订约后的宴会上表示：苏芬两国应“创造彼此间友好的传统，在苏联方面已主动地作了贡献。”芬兰人民兴奋地向苏联这一行动欢呼，工人们到处召开群众大会，向斯大林写信致谢，并派代表向苏联公使表示感激。
    苏联部长会议在一周间接连颁发了两次斯大林奖金，受奖者达一百六十四名，受奖范围遍及科学创作、发明、生产方法的改进诸方面，从发现前所未知的十五种次原子要素，直到组织一个斯达哈诺夫运动者。“所有的发明与改进，都大大提高了苏维埃人民的劳动生产率，增强了苏联的经济与国防力量。”（塔斯社）
    在美国，过去一周反对通过“蒙特法案”的抗议巨潮继续高涨。在美参院司法委员会对该案听取证人举证中，这个被华莱士称为“对美国人民权利宣战书”的法案，受到美国各阶层代表的普遍反对。进步团体的代表斥责该案将创立“法西斯的法律体系”。若干保守团体的代表，也抨击该案违反宪法。福斯特与华莱士分别向参院声明，如该案成为法律，则美共及第三党将拒绝承认，并将公开进行反对。参院官方人士透露，他们收到上万件反对该案的函电，并有各种各样团体的代表四千人要求给以时间前往参院作反对举证。在国会外面，来自各地的代表六千人，在“向华盛顿进军”的口号下，在白宫门前举行了盛大的反蒙特法的示威。所有这些行动，如福斯特所说的，表示了“崇尚自由及寻求和平的人们，决不愿将他们自纳粹手中夺来的东西，交给华尔街。”
    当伦敦正在举行阴谋分裂德国的所谓六国会议（以美国为首，其他参加者有英法荷比卢五国）之时，德国国内举行了“要求德国统一”的请愿签名运动，签名自五月二十三日开始，将在六月十三日结束。仅十天之内，在苏占区一千七百五十余万人民中，已有一千二百五十万人参加了签名。法国占领的鲁尔区，截至五月三十一日止亦有十五万人签名。德境美法占领当局，慑于“几乎每一个德国人都愿他的国家保持统一”（合众社）的坚强意志，竟出动武装警察，甚至带着警犬以搜捕签名的德国人，实行疯狂的迫害。
