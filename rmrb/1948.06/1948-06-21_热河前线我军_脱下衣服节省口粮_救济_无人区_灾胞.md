　　The True Qualities of the People's Army
  　Our Army on the Rehe Front Line
    Takes Off Clothes and Saves Food Rations
    to Relieve Disaster-stricken Compatriots in the "No Man's Land"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rehe Front Line, 16th] The People's Liberation Army, sharing weal and woe with the people, economizes to provide relief to the famine-stricken people in southern Rehe, western Rehe, and northern Ping, areas caused by the new "no-man's-land" created by the bandit Fu. In the Second District of Xinglong County, 80 percent of the people have no food to eat and rely entirely on wild vegetables and tree leaves to survive. In addition to the 18 million yuan in production loans already issued by the democratic government, the Liberation Army is now launching a movement to conserve resources for disaster relief. The political department of a certain unit called on all commanders and fighters to save one liang of millet per person per day, and some units voluntarily requested that during their stationing, they would rather drink thin porridge and eat wild vegetables themselves, saving two liang or four liang of rice per person to help the local disaster victims. The Second Company of a certain regiment also saved an extra day's worth of vegetable money and a month's worth of allowance, along with grain, and distributed it all to the impoverished people in the stationed village. The chief of staff of a certain unit also donated 90 jin of millet from his disability pension. Rong Youliang, a squad leader of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, said, "Seeing the suffering of the villagers reminds me of my childhood." He took off his own shirt and gave it to an old man who had no clothes to wear. Under his influence, in just one day, the soldiers donated more than 40 pieces of clothing and bed sheets. The people were so moved that they shed tears, and they shook the soldiers' hands and said, "You are truly Chairman Mao's troops. We waited day and night, and finally you have come!" The unit's medical personnel, without fatigue, gave injections and medicine to the sick villagers, saving several lives in danger.

  　热河前线我军
    脱下衣服节省口粮
    救济“无人区”灾胞
    【新华社热河前线十六日电】和人民同甘共苦的解放军，节约救济热南、热西、平北等地因傅匪制造新“无人区”而引起饥荒的灾民。兴隆县二区，有百分之八十的人没有粮食吃，全靠野菜树叶充饥。除民主政府已发放一千八百万元生产贷款外，现解放军纷纷发起节约救灾运动。某部政治部号召全体指战员每人每天节约一两小米，有些部队并自动要求在驻军时间，宁可自己喝稀饭、吃野菜，每人节约二两米或四两米救济当地灾民。某团二连还额外节约一天的菜金和一个月的津贴费，连同粮食全部分给驻村难胞。某部参谋长并捐出残废抚恤金小米九十斤，某部五连班长戎有良说：“看到老乡的苦就想起我小的时候了”。他脱下自己的衬衣送给了没有衣服穿的老百姓，在他影响下仅一天中战士们捐出了四十多件衣服和褥单，老百姓感动的直流泪，他们握着战士们的手说：“真是毛主席的队伍呀，我们白日盼，黑夜盼，可把你们盼来了”。部队的卫生人员不辞疲劳，给害病的老百姓打针吃药，若干生命危险的病人因而得救。
