Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Free Greece Radio broadcast: The Headquarters of the Greek Democratic Army has announced the results of the Romilia region (northwest of Athens) campaign from April 15th to May 16th, stating: Thirty-five thousand Royalist Fascist troops, under the command of American officers and with the cover of airplanes and artillery, launched an offensive against the Democratic Army in the Romilia region. After several counter-attacks, the Democratic Army defeated the massive enemy force and successfully crossed Mount Aglaias and Mount Vaudons, joining forces with the Democratic Army in the Thessaly region. It is now clearing the enemy forces in the aforementioned areas. During this period, the Democratic Army killed 747 enemies, wounded 1,456, and captured 128. The communiqué further stated: During this operation in the Romilia region, the bandit army was ordered to eliminate all peaceful residents, killing approximately 2,000 women, children, and the elderly, including forty infants. This was the only victory of the Royalist Fascist army in this offensive.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Free Greece Radio has broadcast a statement from the Greek Interim Democratic Government to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, stating: The last vestiges of freedom and human rights in Greece under Royalist rule have been completely stripped away. More than 10,000 Greek citizens have been massacred by Royalist Fascists, and tens of thousands of democrats are still suffering in prisons and concentration camps. The Free Greek Government requests that the Human Rights Commission take measures to immediately end the Fascist terror.

According to TASS reports: The Soviet Embassy in Athens sent another note to the Athens government on the 27th of last month, refuting the Greek government's reply defending its atrocities and reiterating the Soviet government's position in the May 13th note, that the mass killings of Greek democrats have aroused the indignation of the Soviet people and hoping that this slaughter will be stopped immediately.

Another TASS report: The General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, also sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and the UN Human Rights Commission on the 26th of last month, stating that the central trade union federations of all countries condemn the Athens government's acts of massacring political prisoners and hope that the United Nations will pass a resolution to return Greece to normalcy.
