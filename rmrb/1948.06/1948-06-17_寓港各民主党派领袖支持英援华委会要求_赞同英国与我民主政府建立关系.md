The joint letter also fiercely criticized the United States' policy towards China, which "supports the Chinese autocratic regime and makes China an American appendage." The letter believes that the British Aid China Committee's proposal will be beneficial to both China and Britain. The letter concludes: The Chinese people demand an end to the United States' imperialist policy and hope that Britain will establish a new Far East policy that differs from that of the United States.
