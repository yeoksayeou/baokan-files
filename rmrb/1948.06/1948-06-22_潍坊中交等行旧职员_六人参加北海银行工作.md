Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: (Delayed News) After the liberation of Weixian, the Weifang City North China Bank, entrusted by the Materials Handling Committee of the East China Liberated Area Financial and Economic Office, completed the takeover on May 16th of the former Weixian Chiang Kai-shek's China, Communications, Farmers Bank, and Shandong Provincial Bank, all belonging to bureaucratic capital. Regarding the original staff of the aforementioned banks, after completing the handover procedures, the democratic government respected their personal wishes regarding whether to stay or leave. They adopted a welcoming attitude for those who wished to stay and a farewell attitude for those who wished to leave, allowing them to make their own decisions. After the handover procedures were completed, six personnel requested to stay and work at the Weifang City North China Bank. The bank not only welcomed them but also provided them with appropriate preferential treatment in their living arrangements. Another eight staff members, because their families were still in Qingdao and Jinan, needed to return to Qingdao and Jinan to reunite with them, or temporarily wished to seek employment in Qingdao and Jinan. We respected their wishes, provided them with travel expenses, and gave them all necessary travel conveniences. Before their departure, the North China Bank held a symposium to bid them farewell. Zeng Shan, Political Commissar of the Weifang City Garrison Command, personally delivered a speech, welcoming the former bank staff who stayed in the liberated area to work and serve the people, and hoping that they would fulfill their responsibilities in their work. For those who wished to leave, Political Commissar Zeng, in addition to offering his farewell, also stated: "If the staff members who are unwilling to stay today encounter difficulties in finding employment in the future and wish to come to the liberated area again, we will still welcome them." Political Commissar Zeng pointed out: "The reason we treat the staff members so kindly is because staff members are mental laborers, and they are also working people, who, like other working people, are oppressed and exploited by imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism." Some staff members who originally served in Chiang Kai-shek's banks and other old banks felt ashamed of not being as hardworking and simple as the staff in the liberated area. Political Commissar Zeng comforted them and pointed out: "Except for bad habits such as prostitution, gambling, and opium, we Communists do not interfere with your original lifestyles. In terms of salary, we will also provide preferential treatment within our capabilities to appropriately solve your family living problems. As for our bank staff in the liberated area, like other staff, we will not independently improve our own lives before the overall living standards of the people are improved. But we are not being frugal for the sake of being frugal. Once the people's living standards are improved, we will naturally improve the lives of revolutionary staff as well. As it stands, we do not yet require you to live the same hard and simple lives, this depends on your willingness and consciousness." Political Commissar Zeng also addressed the various concerns of some former staff members due to their past participation in the Kuomintang, saying: "In the past, under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, it was unavoidable that some staff members had relationships and dealings with the Kuomintang. But today, the Kuomintang's reactionary organization must be dissolved. As long as general Kuomintang members register, no longer engage in anti-people activities, and disassociate themselves from the Kuomintang in terms of organization and politics, and abide by the laws of the democratic government, they will be protected by the laws of the democratic government." After giving a detailed analysis of the current people's revolutionary war situation, Political Commissar Zeng smiled and bid farewell to those present, saying: "You are traveling far this time. I believe that we will eventually meet again in Jinan and other places in the near future, and we will be even more familiar then than we are now."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: (Delayed News) The former Weifang City China, Communications, Farmers Bank, and the puppet Shandong Provincial Bank, etc., have been thoroughly investigated and, in accordance with the policy of confiscating bureaucratic capital, have been taken over by the Weifang City North China Bank. The former staff of these banks are currently working with the staff of the North China Bank to complete the handover procedures. They eat and live together, respect each other, and have established good relationships. After a short period of life experience, the mental state of the former staff has undergone tremendous changes. Some former staff members told our staff: "At first, we always thought we were prisoners of war, but from any small way you treat us, we can't find a shadow of this." When the North China Bank staff first entered the China Bank in Dongguan, the battle had just ended, and enemy planes were still flying over from time to time. The bank's basement was very small, and the former staff of the bank were afraid of enemy air raids at night and dared not sleep outside. The North China Bank staff moved outside to live and gave the basement to them. The former staff members were very moved when they compared this spirit of self-denial with the situation when the Chiang army forcibly occupied the basement during the fierce battle in Dongguan and drove the masses out. The government has tried to find personal belongings of the staff that were lost during the tense war, and any materials stored in the banks that belong to private individuals have also been identified for them to claim. After verifying that more than 30 bags of flour stored in the Farmers Bank belonged to the former staff, they were completely returned. Among the former staff who have decided to go to Qingdao and other places, those who have not completed their private affairs are temporarily staying at the North China Bank Guest House. In their free time, they either read books and newspapers or visit Weifang City to see the active restoration and construction after liberation, and their lives are very pleasant.

　　潍坊中交等行旧职员
  　六人参加北海银行工作
    【新华社华东十九日电】迟到消息：潍县解放后，潍坊市北海银行受华东解放区财经办事处物资处理委员会的委托，已于五月十六日将属于官僚资本的前潍县蒋记中国、交通、农民银行及山东省银行等，接收完竣。上述各行原有职员，在办清移交手续之后，其个人去留问题民主政府均尊重其本人意愿，本留者欢迎，去者欢送的态度，由他们自行决策。当移交手续办妥后，有人员六人要求留潍市北海银行工作，该行除表示欢迎外，对其生活亦适当从优照顾。另有职员八人，因其眷属尚在青岛济南，须回青、济团圆，或暂愿去青、济谋职，我方均听其自愿，并发给路费，给予通行的一切便利。临行之前，北海银行曾举行座谈会，表示欢送。潍坊市警备司令部曾山政委特亲临致词，对留解放区工作为人民服务之旧银行职员表示欢迎，并希望他们在工作中克尽职责。对愿他去者，曾政委除致欢送之意外，并表示：如果今天不愿留下的职员将来谋职不顺利时愿再来解放区，我们仍然欢迎。曾政委指出：“我们对待职员们之所以这样友爱，是因为职员们是脑力劳动者，他们也是劳动人民，与其他劳动人民一样被帝国主义、官僚资本主义以及封建主义所压迫，所榨取。”有些原在蒋记银行与其他旧银行服务的职员们自觉不如解放区工作人员的艰苦朴素而感到惭愧。曾政委予以安慰，并指出：“除嫖赌鸦片等恶嗜好外，我们共产党人并不干涉各位的原来的生活习惯。在薪金问题上亦在可能范围内从优照顾，以适当地解决各位家庭生活问题。至于我们解放区银行工作人员，则与其他工作人员一样，在整个人民生活水平未提高前，我们是不单独提高自己的生活的。但我们也不是为艰苦而艰苦，一旦人民生活水平提高了，我们自然也将提高革命工作人员的生活。以目前来说，我们还不要求各位过同样艰苦朴素的生活，这要看各位的自愿与自觉。”对于有些旧职员因自己参加过国民党而发生的各种顾虑，曾政委亦予以解释说：“过去在蒋介石独裁统治下，有些职员和国民党有关系、有来往，是免不了的。但今天国民党的反动组织一定要解散，一般国民党员只要进行登记，不再作反人民的活动，并在组织上政治上与国民党脱离关系，遵守民主政府法令，即能受到民主政府法令的保护。”曾政委在对目前人民革命战争形势作了详尽的分析之后，含笑与到会者告别称：“诸位这次远行了，相信不久将来我们终会在济南等地相见，那时当比这次更加熟悉了。”
    【新华社华东二十日电】迟到消息：前潍市中国、交通、农民银行及伪山东省银行等，经查明确实，按没收官僚资本的政策，由潍市北海银行接管后，各该银行旧职员正与北海银行工作人员赶办移交手续。他们食宿一起，互相尊敬，已建立良好关系。在短时期生活体验后，旧职员的心境已起了极大变化。一部分旧职员向我工作人员说：“我们开始时总以为自己是做了俘虏，可是从你们对待我们的任何一点小地方，也找不出这种影子来。”北海银行工作人员开始进入东关前中国银行时，战斗刚刚结束，敌机仍不时飞临。银行地下室很小，该行旧职员怕敌机夜袭，都不敢在外面睡觉，北海银行工作人员即搬到外面来住，将地下室让出给他们。旧职员们把这种克己为人的精神与蒋军在东关激战时强占地下室将群众一齐赶出来的情况对比，十分感动。职员私人物件在战争紧张时散失者，政府已设法代查，各银行所存物资如有属于私人者，亦由其认领。农民银行所存三十余袋面粉，查明确系属于原职员私人者后，均已完全归还。已决定去青岛等地之旧职员中，有因私人事务未处理完善者，均暂住于北海银行招待所，暇时或阅读书报，或观光潍市解放后积极恢复建设之情景，生活甚为愉快。
