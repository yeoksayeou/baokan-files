　　【Taihang News】Xijiao Village is the most severely affected village in Pingding County, and therefore has received the most loans in the past. Last year, it received six loans totaling 3.88 million yuan (Jicha). The year before last, it received one loan of 69,000 yuan, for a total of 3.949 million yuan. These loans were distributed to 272 poor peasant households, 163 middle peasant households, and 14 landlord and rich peasant households, for a total of 449 households, accounting for 85.5% of the village's 525 households.

　　However, in the past, loan decisions were made by cadres, resulting in cadres and those with connections to cadres receiving more loans, while ordinary people received fewer. The maximum loan per household was 3,300 yuan, and the minimum was 400 yuan. Cadres and those connected to them often received 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. A particularly serious problem was the cooperative's embezzlement of loans and cadres forcing the masses to invest in small-scale cooperatives. Out of seven loans, forced investment occurred four times, with the village's five small-scale cooperatives occupying a total of more than 1.81 million yuan in loans. The large cooperative directly embezzled 578,000 yuan in loans in one instance (allocated to the masses' names but not given to them for use). In total, the large and small cooperatives occupied 2,392,900 yuan in loans.

　　Another problem was favoring poor and hired peasants and excluding middle peasants from receiving loans. Last winter, during the review and transfer of loans, comrades from the bank and the district announced to the village that the loans received by middle peasants should be transferred to poor and hired peasants. As a result, a total of 113 households were forced to transfer their loans, and the transferred funds were loaned to 71 poor and hired peasant households, 56 of which were widows, widowers, orphans, and dependents of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with no labor power. A total of 947,800 yuan in loans was transferred to these people. Because they were unable to produce, some invested in cooperatives, while others engaged in usury. According to incomplete statistics (missing two streets), 33 households engaged in usury, with monthly interest rates ranging from 3,000 yuan per 10,000 yuan to 1,500 yuan or one dou of millet. After this review, three measures were established to correct the deviations: (1) All occupied funds of both large and small cooperatives should be returned to the original borrowers within a certain period. (2) Middle peasants should also enjoy the right to loans. New loans should not be divided between middle and poor peasants; everyone should discuss who has production difficulties that cannot be solved and who can receive loans. Middle peasants who had their loans transferred last year should be taken care of in the new loans. (3) Everyone recognized that loans were for production, not relief. Old loans for widows, widowers, and orphans, except for those genuinely engaged in labor-capital combination and mutual aid production, should be persuaded to withdraw from investment and lending. Those who could not engage in labor-capital combination and mutual aid production could transfer their loans to others, and those with difficulties who could not make a living could be helped with relief.

　　This spring, the village allocated a total of 1.4 million yuan in loans, 30 shi of grain for loans, and an additional 15 shi of relief grain. Based on past experience, the masses unanimously demanded that who should receive loans and who should not should be decided democratically through discussion, and the time limit should not be too short, to be determined by each individual. In addition, because the village had many loans, it was necessary to have a dedicated person to represent the masses in managing loans and inspecting their use. The masses elected five loan committee members to form a loan committee. The new loans were issued under the leadership of the loan committee, and the issuance of new loans was carried out by production team, with each team reporting the number of loans needed and the production sub-teams meeting to assess whether loans should be given and how much. Based on the assessment results of each sub-team, there were a total of 368 loan households. Finally, the village-wide conference reviewed and removed 47 households that did not need loans, deciding to grant loans to a total of 321 households, including 118 middle peasant households with a total of 382,000 yuan in loans and 13.2 dou of grain, and 203 poor peasant households with 1,018,000 yuan in loans and 16.8 dou of grain.

　　After the loans were issued, the masses generally reflected that "this loan was handled very thoughtfully," and "our village is taking good care of us. With so many loans, our difficulties will almost be solved. Let's work hard on production."

　　平定西郊村分配贷款办法好
  　民主评议细致合理
    【太行讯】西郊是平定受灾最严重的村，因之过去贷款最多，去年共贷款六次，共计三百八十八万元（冀钞，下同），前年贷款一次六万九千元，总共贷款三百九十四万九千元，计贷给贫农二百七十二户，中农一百六十三户，地主富农十四户，共四百四十九户，贷户占全村五百二十五户的百分之八十五·五强。
    但过去每次贷款都是干部决定，因之干部或与干部有关系者贷的多，一般群众贷的少，每户最多者为三千三百元，最少的四百元，而干部和干部有关的人差不多都是两三万或三四万的。特别严重的问题，是合作社挪用贷款与干部强迫群众往小型社入股，七次贷款中，强迫入股的有四次，全村五个小型社即共占贷款一百八十一万余元，大合作社直接挪用贷款一次五十七万八千余元（分配到群众名下不给群众使用），大小社共计占用贷款二百三十九万二千九百元。
    另一个毛病是恩赐贫雇排斥中农贷款。去冬查转贷时，银行和区上的同志到该村宣布中农所贷之款要一律转给贫雇，这样当时被逼转的贷户共一百一十三户，转出的款又贷给贫雇七十一户，其中有五十六户全系鳏寡孤独和无劳力的军干烈属，计转到这些人手里的贷款九十四万七千八百元。他们因不能生产，贷款后，有的往合作社入股，有的放高利贷，据不完全统计（缺两道街）放高利贷的就有三十三户，每万元月息有三千元的，有一千五百元的，有一斗小米的。经过这次检讨，定出三项纠正偏向办法：（一）不论大小社所有占款在一定期限内一律退给原贷户。（二）中农同样享受贷款权利，新贷不分中贫农由大家讨论，谁生产困难没法解决谁就可以贷，对去年被转贷的中农要在新贷中予以照顾。（三）大家认识了贷款为生产不是救济，鳏寡孤独的旧贷除真正劳资结合互助生产的外，其它如入股放帐应说服收回，根本不能进行劳资结合互助生产的，可转贷给别人，有困难而无法生活的，从救济上解决。
    这次春贷全村共分配贷款一百四十万元，贷粮三十石，另有救济粮十五石。对这次新贷，群众根据过去的经验，一致要求谁该贷谁不该贷大伙讨论民主决定，期限不能太短，由各人自定。另外因全村贷款很多，需要有专人代表群众管理贷款专务检查贷款使用，群众选出贷款委员五人，组成了贷款委员会，新贷由贷委会领导发放，发放新贷是采取了以生产小组为单位，自报贷款数，经生产分队开会评议是否该贷和贷款多少。各分队评议结果，贷款户共三百六十八户。最后全村大会审查，免去不需要贷款的四十七户，决定贷给共三百二十一户，内有中农一百十八户，共贷款三十八万二千元，贷粮十三石二斗，贫农二百零三户，贷款一百零一万八千元，贷粮十六石八斗。
    贷款后，群众普遍反映“这回贷款办的真碰心思”，“咱村上边照顾的真好，贷款这样多，困难差不多也就解决啦，好好闹生产吧”。
