　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Moscow dispatch: “Red Fleet” newspaper recently published an article criticizing the US government’s plan to transform Japan into a country with a high potential for a war economy. The newspaper pointed out: The Draper Mission has advocated equipping Japanese industry with new machinery; MacArthur has issued a secret order to halt dismantling and to remove hundreds of armaments factories from the reparations list, including 20 tank manufacturing plants and 45 aircraft manufacturing plants. The plan drafted for these factories almost exceeds 100% of their pre-war levels. According to MacArthur's instructions, Japan's four major zaibatsu – Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda – are not being broken up, so many of their industries are naturally removed from the reparations list. Hitoshi Ashida, in his conversation with Draper, claimed: "Japan is preparing to cooperate with the United States in implementing the plan to transform Japan into an anti-communist fortress." To this end, the Ashida government has drafted a bill to reduce corporate profit tax rates, hoping to attract a large influx of American capital. At the same time, it has frozen the wages of Japanese workers and civil servants at low levels in order to continue their colonial exploitation, while the Japanese and American monopoly capital groups are enjoying the benefits derived from this exploitation. The Ashida reactionary government is persecuting the laboring people who are sharply dissatisfied with the reactionary rule. Although the Ashida government includes Socialists, even "left-wing" Socialists, it cannot alleviate the people's dissatisfaction. The false socialists of Japan have exposed themselves to the people as agents of American capital. The May Day rally and demonstration in Tokyo, attended by a million people, proves the strength of the democratic camp uniting workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and laboring intellectuals. The joint offensive of Japanese and American reactionary labor is being met with a counterattack from the masses of people united under the slogan of establishing a unified people's democratic front.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida told the House of Representatives Reparations Committee on the 24th that Japan will receive US loans of $750 million this year. The first batch of the loans Ashida referred to is a US cotton credit loan of $60 million, invested separately by the US Export-Import Bank and private banks such as Chase, Citibank, and US Trust & Savings Bank. In addition, it also includes a $150 million installment loan and $100 million belonging to Japan from the Japan-Korea construction fund.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to United Press Washington: The Draper Report on restoring Japan's war industry potential was formally announced on the 19th. According to this plan, which represents the views of the US Department of the Army, the total amount of Japanese reparations will be reduced to $167 million, and Japanese assets in China and Taiwan may also be regarded as reparations and must be offset against China's share of reparations. In addition to restoring Japan's general heavy industry, the plan also recommends removing aircraft manufacturing plants and private armaments factories from the reparations list, requiring MacArthur to take unilateral action to implement this reparations plan that disregards the interests of the countries that fought against Japan, first and foremost China. Regarding foreign trade, it is recommended that Japan's private trade freedom should be restored as soon as possible, and with the help of "foreign capital" (referring to American capital), its exports should be increased to $1.575 billion annually, exceeding its pre-war export volume by about two times. Therefore, the Japanese merchant fleet will also be restored to its pre-war scale. According to an Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch, after this news reached Tokyo, major newspapers with monopoly capital backgrounds immediately filled entire pages with flattering words such as "deeply grateful," "benevolent," "generous," and "magnanimous." "Japanese Economy" magazine strongly expressed the wishes of the Japanese zaibatsu, saying that Japan must strive to always maintain its economic superiority in Far Eastern countries.

　　美帝扶助日本侵略
  　力图保留飞机坦克等军火业
    今年将对日贷款七亿五千万美元
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】莫斯科讯：“红舰队”报顷撰文抨击美国政府正计划将日本变为具有高度战争经济潜力的国家。该报指称：德莱柏代表团已主张以新式机器装备日本工业，麦克阿瑟已发出密令制止拆卸，并自赔偿名单中勾消数百家军火工厂，包括廿家坦克制造厂和四十五家飞机制造厂，为这些工厂拟就的计划几乎超过其战前水平的百分之百。按照麦克阿瑟的指令，日本四大财阀——三井、三菱、住友、安田均不被分散，因而他们的许多工业就自然从赔偿名单中剔除。芦田均在其与德莱柏的谈话中声称：“日本正准备在执行变日本为反共堡垒的计划中与美国合作”。为此，芦田政府一方面草拟了减低公司利润税率的法案，冀能使美资大量涌入，同时它又将日本工人和公务人员的薪资冻结在低廉的水平上，以继续他们殖民地性质的剥削，而日美独占资本集团则正在享受这种剥削得来的利益。芦田反动政府正在迫害那些尖锐不满反动统治的劳动人民，芦田政府虽然包括社会党人甚至“左翼”社会党人，但并不能缓和人民的不满，日本的假社会主义者，已在人民面前暴露了他们自己就是美国资本的代理人。东京百万人民参加的五一节大会和示威，证明了团结着工人、农民、小资产阶级和劳动知识分子的民主阵营的力量，日本和美国反动劳力的联合进攻，正遭遇到在建立统一人民民主阵线的口号下团结起来的人民大众方面的反击。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】法新社东京电讯称：日首相芦田均于二十四日告众院赔偿委员会称，日本今年将获得美国贷款七亿五千万美元。芦田所指贷款数目中之第一批为六千万美元之美棉信用贷款，此项贷款由美国进出口银行及私营之大通、花旗、美国信托储蓄等银行分别投资。此外，尚包括一亿五千万美元之分期贷款，及日韩建设基金中属于日本之一亿美元。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：恢复日本战争工业潜力之德莱柏报告，已于十九日正式公布。根据此一代表美陆军部意见之计划，日本赔偿总额将减至一亿六千七百万美元，而日本在中国及台湾之资产亦得视为赔偿品，并须与中国应得赔偿部分相抵销。该计划除恢复日本一般重工业外，并建议将飞机制造厂及私人军火工厂自赔偿名单中剔除，要求麦克阿瑟采取片面行动，以执行此种无视对日作战各国，首先是中国利益的赔偿计划。至于对外贸易方面，则建议应尽速恢复日本私人贸易自由，并在“外国资本”（指美国资本）帮助下，提高其输出至每年十五亿七千五百万美元，超过其战前输出额约两倍。因此，日本商船队也将恢复至战前的规模。另据法新社东京电讯说，此一消息传至东京后，以独占资本为背景的各大报纸，立刻整版塞满了“深表感激”、“仁慈”、“宽厚”、“慷慨”等谄媚的字眼。“日本经济”杂志更强烈地表示了日本财阀们的愿望说，日本必须努力永远保持其在远东国家经济上的优越性。
