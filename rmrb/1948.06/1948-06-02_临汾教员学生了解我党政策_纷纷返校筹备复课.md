　　Linfen Teachers and Students Understand Our Party's Policies
  　and Return to School to Prepare for Resumption of Classes

    [This dispatch from the Jin-nan Front, 28th, reports] Students and teachers from six secondary schools in Linfen City, who had been subjected to the reactionary education of the Yan [Xishan] bandit regime, have completely changed their fear of being killed after accepting the Linfen work team's publicity about the democratic government's various policies and witnessing many facts that are entirely consistent with those policies. During the Yan bandit's rule, they had been deceived with propaganda that the Communist Party had "24 kinds of torture and 36 ways to kill," that "if you're not killed today, you'll be killed tomorrow," and "if you're not killed during the day, you'll be killed at night." In particular, when our army liberated Dongguan, the Yan bandits again spread deceptive propaganda, saying, "The Eighth Route Army uses iron wire to pull men by their noses and transports women away naked in trucks." This created a state of terror and unease among the students and teachers of various schools, day and night. When the People's Liberation Army broke through the city walls, many people fled with the Chiang [Kai-shek] and Yan bandit troops in order to save their lives, only to be shot to death by random gunfire. Some jumped over the city walls and fell to their deaths, while others hid in underground caves, preferring to starve to death rather than come out, or even committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. However, after the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they maintained strict discipline and did not violate the slightest thing. The democratic municipal government issued a proclamation to reassure the people, stating, "Protect the lives and property of urban residents, merchants, workers, students, foreigners, and religious groups." At the same time, Deputy Director Pei of the administrative office and the Yue Nan Middle School work team patiently explained the Communist Party's lenient policies and attitude towards intellectuals to the students. In particular, last month when our army captured Dongguan, the liberated students (who also participated in the work team) used their own experiences of the past month in the liberated areas to publicize to their classmates and teachers, thus completely shattering the Yan bandit's deceptive propaganda. Many students and teachers deeply repented, saying, "If we had known earlier that the Communist Party had such lenient policies, we wouldn't have been afraid to run away! Those who ran away died unjustly!" A Linfen Middle School student said, "With the Communist Party implementing such good policies, the days of old Yan and old Chiang are numbered." An old teacher at Sanlian Middle School said, "Old Yan subjugates people with force, which does not win their hearts; the Communist Party subjugates people with virtue, which wins their heartfelt joy and sincere submission." Guo Lian, a training officer at Han Zhao Middle School, told the work team, "I originally joined the Comrades Association and the Comrades Vanguard Team, but because I was afraid, I filled in the forms as a quartermaster. These past few days, after hearing you explain the policies, I have been so moved that I can't eat or sleep in peace. Now I am willing to confess everything and follow the Communist Party from now on." At the same time, many students and teachers mentioned that the Chiang and Yan bandit troops forced them to the front lines to do construction work at bayonet point, resulting in innocent sacrifices, and that they organized special organs such as the "Special Police Team" and "Training Cadre Corps" to brutally kill young people. They all said with deep pain, "All the atrocities that old Chiang and old Yan have publicized about the Eighth Route Army are exactly what they themselves have done." The day after the work team publicized the policies, students from various schools returned to their schools one after another. For example, only one or two people remained at the Women's Normal School after the escape; now more than thirty people have come. Only ten or so people remained at the Linfen Provincial Normal School after the escape; now more than fifty people have come. Only ten or so sick people (sick from labor) remained at Linfen Middle School after the escape; now more than forty people have come. On the 22nd, each school established a school affairs committee to lead the students in intensifying their study of current affairs and the Land Law Outline, etc. The committee is also preparing for the resumption of classes in the near future.

　　临汾教员学生了解我党政策
  　纷纷返校筹备复课
    【本报晋南前线二十八日电】受阎匪反动教育的临汾市六个中等学校的学生教员，经接受临汾工作队宣传民主政府各种政策，及他们目击许多事实与政策完全相符合时，害怕杀头的思想完全转变。在阎匪统治时期曾向他们欺骗宣传共产党有“二十四刑，三十六杀”，“今天不杀明天杀”，“白天不杀黑夜杀”。特别当我军解放东关时，阎匪又欺骗宣传说：“八路军用铁丝穿在男人的鼻子拉走，把妇女脱光衣服用汽车运走”。于是造成各校学生教员日夜恐怖不安。当解放军破城之际，许多人为了逃命，跟着蒋阎匪军逃跑，被乱枪打死，有的人跳城墙逃跑跌死，甚至有些人钻在地洞，宁可饿死不出来，或服安眠药自杀。但是，当解放军进城之后，纪律严明秋毫无犯，民主市政府布告安民指出：“保护城市居民、商人、工人、学生、外侨及宗教团体之生命财产安全。”同时，行署裴副主任及岳南中学工作队耐心给学生讲解共产党的宽大政策及对待知识分子的态度，特别是上月我军攻占东关时，被解放的学生（他们也参加工作队），以他们在解放区一月来的各种亲身经历，向自己的同学和教员宣传，于是阎匪的欺骗宣传完全被粉碎。许多学生教员深深忏悔的说：“早知道共产党是这样宽大的政策，那里还用害怕逃跑呢？！那些逃跑的人都冤枉死了！”临汾中学学生说：“共产党实行象这样的好政策，老阎老蒋的死日快到了。”三联中一个老教员说：“老阎以力服人者，非心服也；共产党以德服人者，衷心悦而诚服也”。汉赵中学训育员郭廉向工作队说：“我原先参加同志会和同志先锋队，因为害怕，都在表上填为司务员，这几天听到你们讲政策，我被感动的吃饭睡觉也不安，现在我愿坦白出来，今后要跟共产党走。”同时许多学生教员提到蒋阎匪军以刺刀逼着他们上火线做工事无辜牺牲，并组织“特警队、训干团”等特务机关残杀青年时，都沉痛的说：“凡是老蒋老阎宣传八路军的一切暴行，就是他们自己所干的。”工作队宣传政策的第二天，各校学生纷纷回校。如女子师范原来跑的剩下一二个人，现在来了三十余人。临汾省立师范原来跑的剩下十余个人，现在来了五十多人。临汾中学原来跑的剩下十余个病人（做工病的），现在来了四十余人。二十二日各校成立校务委员会，领导学生加紧学习目前时事及土地法大纲等，该会并筹备最近复课工作。（维进）
