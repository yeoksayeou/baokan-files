Good Communist Party Member Zhang Zhenjiang

Zhang Zhenjiang, the chairman of the Peasants' Association of Xiaoxinzhuang Village, Ding County, is forty-three years old this year. His family consists of six people: a sixty-eight-year-old mother, a blind wife, and three children. Zhang Zhenjiang started working as a long-term laborer at the age of sixteen. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), and only returned home last year during the land reform to serve as the chairman of the village's Peasants' Association.

When Zhang Zhenjiang is mentioned, the peasants of Xiaoxinzhuang all have good things to say. Poor peasant Wang Guoxiang said: "When firewood was being distributed, Zhang Zhenjiang's family had a pot hanging over the stove, but he let others have it first. In the end, there wasn't enough firewood, so he grabbed a handful of small pieces and said to others, 'It doesn't matter if it's a little more or a little less.' I think he's a good example." "That's right!" Li Shutian continued, "When land was being distributed, some were vying for the good land, and others were vying for the land that was close by. In the end, the piece of land at Mazhuangzi was left, and no one wanted it because it was too far away, but he took it." At the village representatives' committee meeting, everyone brought up many good things about Zhang Zhenjiang. Wang Xu said: "Zhang Zhenjiang takes the lead in his work and isn't afraid of hardship. He does all the work at home by himself and also automatically guarantees to do farm work for military families for three days a month. The other day, military family member Wang Hengyi complained that the farm work being done for them wasn't very good. He personally found Liu Qingyuan, who was doing the work, and watered the garden for the military family for a whole day. This had a good impact on the military family and was also a good education for the person doing the farm work. This year, when pulling wheat, our cadres' meeting decided that the cadres should take the lead. Zhang Zhenjiang didn't stop that day and worked harder than anyone else." Liu Yintian said: "When discussing the distribution of floating wealth and grading levels, the group meeting discussed Zhang Zhenjiang as a second-class person, but he voluntarily lowered himself to third-class." Female representative Wu Jinran said: "Zhang Zhenjiang does what he says. He does more work for the village than anyone else. Everyone has their ups and downs, but he's never been unhappy, no matter what. Whatever is difficult to handle, he goes to do it; whoever can't be persuaded to work, he goes to persuade them." After the meeting, a poor peasant's son named Ming, who was listening in, told me: "Zhang Zhenjiang is really a good person. When distributing livestock, he called on everyone to share it. When it was his turn and there was none left, he borrowed some from others to use." Zhang Zhenjiang, after listening, said, "I do these things for everyone."

Zhang Zhenjiang worked as a long-term laborer for a family for more than ten years. The employer spoke well of him, and the poor people also supported him. He said, "The employer says I'm good because I work hard for him. But in other places, I can't be soft-hearted with him. The poor people say I'm good, so whatever they need me for, I'll definitely do it for them."

On June 7th, I passed through Zhuangzi Village, where Zhang Zhenjiang had worked as a long-term laborer for many years. The new Peasants' Association director, Zhang Yuting, said: "Zhang Zhenjiang worked in the village for more than ten years, and no one in the village has anything bad to say about him. He's never been unfair to any of the common people." An old lady Liu, hearing about Zhang Zhenjiang, also chimed in, "He served as a trade union cadre in our village, and he had the poor people at heart. That year, when the Japanese came, I couldn't walk, and he pulled me along. Last year, when he stopped working as a long-term laborer, he said to the people when he left, 'Now I'm not working as a long-term laborer anymore. Everyone, examine me and tell me if I've done anything wrong, give me some feedback.' When others heard this, everyone said he was good."

　　好共产党员张振江
    定县小辛庄农会主席张振江，今年四十三岁，家里六口人：一个六十八岁的老娘，一个双目失明的媳妇，三个孩子。张振江从十六岁就给人家作长活，民国三十年加入中国共产党，直到去年土地改革时才回了家，担任该村农会主席。
    提起张振江，小辛庄的农民们没有不说好的。贫农王国祥说：分柴火时，张振江家里吊着锅，却先尽别人分。末了柴火不够了，他抱了一把柴火毛毛，对别人说：“这没有什么，多点少点没关系。”“我看人家就是好样的。”“对！”李树田接着说：“分地时，这个争着要好的，那个争着要近的。末了剩下马庄子那一块，谁也嫌远，他要了。”在全村代表委员会上，大家提出张振江许多好处。王许说：“张振江工作带头，不怕劳苦，家里活全凭他一个人干，还自动保证一月给军属代耕三天。那天军属王亨义反映代耕的不大好，他亲自找到代耕的刘庆元，给军属浇了一天园，对军属影响好，对代耕教育也好。今年拔麦子，咱们干部会上决定干部带头，张振江那天也没停过，比别人干的都强。”刘银田说：“讨论分浮财划等级，小组会上把振江讨论成二等，他自动降为三等。”女代表吴金然说：“人家振江说到哪里作到哪里，村里什么事也是人家作的多，人谁也有个如意不如意，人家不论哪回也没不高兴过，哪件事难办了，他去；哪个人叫不动了，他去。”会后一个旁听的贫农儿子明告诉我说：“张振江可真是一个好人，分牲口叫着大家分，轮到他没有了，他就向别人借着用。”张振江听了说：“我干这些事是为了大家”。
    张振江曾在一家干了十来年长活了，雇主说好，穷人也拥护。他说：“雇主说咱好，是咱们给他干十强，在别的地方可不能和他软心眼；穷人说咱不错，不管什么事，穷人只要用着咱了，一定给人办到。”
    六月七日，我路过张振江作了多年长活的庄子村，新农会主任张玉廷说：“张振江在村干了十来年，村里没一个人说不是，对哪一个老百姓都没有曲曲弯弯的。”刘老太太听到说张振江，也插嘴说：“人家在俺村当着工会干部，对穷人一个心。那年的日本子，我走不动，人家拉着我走。去年人家不干长活了，走时向老百姓说：‘我现在不干长活了，大家检讨检讨我有什么不是，给我提提。’别人听了，谁也说他好”。
