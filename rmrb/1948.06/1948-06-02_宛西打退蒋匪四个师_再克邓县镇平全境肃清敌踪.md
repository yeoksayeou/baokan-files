Xinhua News Agency, Wancheng Front, 30th: The Wancheng Liberation Army has repelled the invasion of four reorganized divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, thwarting the enemy's plan to reoccupy the Wancheng area. In early June, after our army successively captured the four county towns of Neixiang, Xichuan, Zhenping, and Deng County, Zhang Zhen, director of Chiang's Fifth Pacification Zone and concurrent commander of the Xinyang Command Post, personally led approximately 40,000 troops from four divisions in a two-pronged invasion of Wancheng. One route, including the Reorganized 58th Division, Reorganized 10th Division, and Reorganized 20th Division, advanced westward from the Pinghan Railway Line, and on the 19th, sneaked into the Deng County and Xinye area, capturing Deng County town. On the 21st, the 58th Division was ambushed by our forces at Liguanqiao, 80 li southeast of Xichuan, wiping out two enemy battalions in one fell swoop, capturing over 300 prisoners. This route of the enemy captured Neixiang on the 22nd. The other route, the Chiang army's Reorganized 9th Division, invaded westward from Nanyang, with its vanguard reaching Zhenping town on the 19th, and advancing to Chaobei, 40 li west of Zhenping town, on the 20th. On the 21st, they were ambushed by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. The Chiang bandit army, terrified by the heavy blows inflicted along the way, shrank back to the Jiasong and Chaobei area between Neixiang and Zhenping on the 23rd. Starting on the 24th, all the bandits fled eastward. On the 25th, our forces annihilated a company of their rearguard, the 58th Division, at Hegezhuang, 20 li northwest of Zhenping. Neixiang, Deng County, and Zhenping have been recovered by our forces, and there are no traces of the enemy in the entire Wancheng area.

Xinhua News Agency, Wancheng Front, 30th: The enemy, having scraped together eight brigades for the invasion of Wancheng, is suffering from low morale and showing great timidity. During the advance, several enemy divisions huddled together, afraid to disperse. When acting, they put small units in front for reconnaissance, and dare not continue to advance as soon as they encounter our army, so the advance is slow, exhausting and unbearable, and their discipline is corrupt, looting wildly along the way. The Chiang bandit Reorganized 9th Division carried out looting in the Chaobei area west of Zhenping town. The common people rushed to the Liberation Army for protection. The Chiang bandit army shamelessly carried out various slanders against us, but the people's reply was: "The Kuomintang army is 'good', the Kuomintang army is 'good', they take away even broken copper and scrap iron. The Communist army is 'bad', the Communist army is 'bad', they don't even love gold and silver treasures." From this ballad, it can be seen the Wancheng people's hatred for the Chiang bandit army and their love for the Liberation Army.

　　宛西打退蒋匪四个师
  　再克邓县镇平全境肃清敌踪
    【新华社宛西前线三十日电】宛西解放军打退蒋匪军四个整编师的进犯，粉碎了敌人这次重占宛西地区的计划。本月上旬，我军先后攻克内乡、淅川、镇平、邓县等四县城后，蒋记第五绥区兼信阳指挥所主任张轸亲率四个师约四万兵力，分两路进犯宛西，一路包括整五十八师、整十师、整二十师自平汉线西进，十九日窜至邓县、新野地区，并陷邓县城。二十一日五十八师在淅川东南八十里的李官桥，遭我堵击，一举歼敌两个营，生俘三百余名，该路敌于二十二日陷我内乡城。另路蒋军整九师由南阳西犯，十九日先头部队到达镇平城，二十日进至镇平城西四十里晁陂，二十一日遭我堵击，毙伤甚重。蒋匪军沿路遭我痛击恐慌万状，二十三日全部匪军龟缩于内乡、镇平间贾宋、晁陂地区，二十四日起即悉数东窜，二十五日我在镇平西北二十里的贺个庄又歼灭其后卫五十八师一个连。内乡、邓县、镇平城当为我收复，宛西全境已无敌踪。
    【新华社宛西前线三十日电】此次拼凑八个旅向宛西进犯敌士气低落，表现非常畏缩，在行进中敌数个师龟缩一团，不敢分散。行动时，将小部队放在前边搜索，一遇我军即不敢继续前进，因此行进迟缓疲惫不堪，且其纪律败坏，沿途大肆抢掠。蒋匪整九师在镇平城西晁陂一带进行抢劫，老百姓奔找解放军保护，蒋匪军恬不知耻的对我作种种诬蔑宣传，但老百姓的回答是：“国军‘好’，国军‘好’，破铜乱铁都拿跑。共军‘坏’，共军‘坏’，金银财宝也不爱。”从这首歌谣里，可以说明宛西人民对蒋匪军的痛恨与对解放军的爱戴。
