　　【Jinan News】In Fangying Village, Weixian County, the wheat harvest is abundant this year, and the masses are helping each other in a concentrated rush to harvest. After compensating middle peasants for errors in land redistribution and conducting mutual aid education, the production enthusiasm of middle and poor peasants in the village has been greatly boosted. Due to a shortage of livestock and carts, twenty-one mutual aid teams of varying sizes (three, five, or ten people) were formed based on the principle of voluntarism. Some who had more land worried that those with less land would be at a disadvantage in mutual aid, so those with similar amounts of land formed groups. Poor peasants with less land also voluntarily formed groups to glean wheat and collect firewood. Each group voluntarily offered to care for the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned, as well as families of revolutionary martyrs who lacked labor, promising to be as diligent as if they were harvesting their own wheat. The group led by poor peasant Liu Zhongying expanded to twelve families during the wheat harvest, with fourteen young and strong members. Middle and poor peasants are closely united. Liu Zhongying, despite injuring his leg, actively participated in mutual aid and helped a widow harvest two mu of wheat. Landlord Ji Shufang, who lacked oxen, also joined Ji Laofa's group, which had oxen, exchanging labor for harvesting. Poor peasant Sun Yuchi's group finished harvesting their own wheat field in one day and then helped Fang Luyou's mother and the family of revolutionary martyr Yu Guirong harvest their wheat. The masses have now realized that "mutual aid is good." Starting from June 2nd, all comrades in the work team also joined the masses in the wheat harvest, helping with the cutting. Female comrades voluntarily replaced the cooks to prepare meals, allowing the cooks to also participate in the harvest. In two days, fifteen people helped fourteen elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned households and two middle peasant households harvest 32.5 mu of wheat. Comrades from the Sodium Sulfide Bureau, in addition to participating in the harvest, also provided ten head of livestock and five carts to groups lacking these tools. Under the planned leadership of the mutual aid teams, one-third of the harvest was completed within three days. Because of the timely rains last year and the increased wheat planting, the harvest is much better than last year. Generally, the larger ears of wheat have more than sixty grains, and some even have over eighty grains. Those who have already threshed their wheat have harvested as much as 180 jin per mu, and even the poorer wheat yields around 120 jin. Poor peasant Fang Ruxin harvested four sacks of wheat from two mu of land, roughly 1.3 to 1.4 sacks per mu. Now, wheat is continuously entering the threshing grounds, and wheat stacks are piling up like mountains, with farmers celebrating the bumper harvest. To ensure the wheat is safely stored, the work team is conducting a further mobilization to protect the wheat, raising the masses' vigilance and strictly preventing sabotage by bad elements. The village's blackboard newspaper and radio station are also constantly reporting on the wheat harvest, offering precautions to ensure the smooth completion of the harvest.
