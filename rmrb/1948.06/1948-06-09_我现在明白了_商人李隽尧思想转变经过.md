I Now Understand
    -- The Ideological Transformation of Merchant Li Junyao
    Li Junyao is the manager of the National Shoe Store in Dongguan, Linfen. In the past, he listened to the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops: "The Communist Party has twenty-four kinds of torture and thirty-two ways to kill," and "Private businesses will be confiscated." Therefore, he was very hostile to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Linfen, his thinking changed after experiencing many concrete facts, and he realized that the Communist Party was truly the savior of the people. The following is his own account of his ideological transformation:
    My name is Li Junyao, and I run a shoe store in Dongguan. On the afternoon of April 10th, I was captured by the 66th Division and taken into the city to carry wounded soldiers. As soon as I entered the city, the People's Liberation Army attacked Dongguan. At that time, I felt a sharp pain and sadness in my heart, worried about the lives of my wife and children. Later, I thought that even if my wife wasn't killed, she would be "raped" by the People's Liberation Army, and I didn't know what my children would suffer. I was so anxious that I couldn't sleep all night. But then I thought: "The People's Liberation Army are also Chinese, why would they be so 'cruel'?" I couldn't prove which of my thoughts was right. At that time, I was praying to God to protect me, not to lose everything, and not to have my wife and children killed.
    The next day, a storm raged throughout the city. Some people said: "Manager So-and-so was killed by the 'Communist bandits'." Others said: "The wife of Manager So-and-so was stripped naked by the People's Liberation Army and dragged outside the city." Military newspapers were also plastered all over the streets. One of them showed a woman, stripped naked by the "Communist bandits," standing under a wall. I seemed to feel that my wife was also like that. I immediately fainted. I hated the Communist Party for being so "cruel," for killing my wife and children alive.
    From then on, I was homeless and lived in the home of Manager Niu of Maoshengyong in the city. He also had a child, about the same age as mine. Whenever that child called out to his parents, I thought of my own children and felt sad. I couldn't eat or sleep all day long.
    On the evening of May 17th, the People's Liberation Army attacked the city again. I thought this was the end, my children were all dead, and I wouldn't survive either. Manager Niu and his family and I squeezed into a cellar, waiting for the People's Liberation Army to come and kill us. But the reality was not as bad as I had imagined. Every soldier of the People's Liberation Army who came in was kind and gentle, and comforted us, saying: "Folks, don't be afraid, we are the People's Liberation Army, and we are fighting to liberate Linfen to save you!" We nodded, but didn't believe their words, thinking: "You are clearly going to kill us, but you are pretending to be good people." We suspected that the People's Liberation Army was playing some kind of trick. By the time it was dawn, we still hadn't seen anyone come to kill us, and I still couldn't believe it. At this time, I was desperate to go home and see, but Manager Niu and his family persuaded me not to go. On the third day, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I secretly ran home. When I entered the door, my whole family was there. I couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I was seeing a ghost. My child saw me and shouted, running over to grab me, calling out "Daddy is back," "Daddy is back." His mother probably guessed what I was thinking (because his wife had been transferred to the countryside by the democratic government and had met a prisoner captured by the People's Liberation Army on the city wall, who told her about the situation in the city), and smiled and said: "Come over here, what are you standing there for? We're not ghosts!" Then his mother began to talk about how good the People's Liberation Army was, how they transferred them to outside the city, and how the government lent them food to eat. His mother also said: "If it weren't for the People's Liberation Army helping us, we would have starved to death because we had nothing to eat." I listened to my wife's words, and thought about the comforting words of the People's Liberation Army I had met in the city that day, and then I felt relieved. My wife led me around the house, and I saw that all our things were there, not even a single shoe was missing from the counter. Some of the loose items had been collected by the People's Liberation Army and put in a room. From this, I understood that the People's Liberation Army is truly a "benevolent and righteous army." I was born in Peiping, and have been to Taiyuan and Xi'an, and traveled all over the country. I have never seen such a good army. The deceptive propaganda of the die-hard army is just to deceive the people to sell their lives for them. Their hypocritical benevolence and righteousness will one day be seen through by the people.

　　我现在明白了
    ——商人李隽尧思想转变经过
    李隽尧是临汾东关国民鞋庄的经理，过去听了蒋阎匪军欺骗宣传：“共产党有二十四刑、三十二杀”，“买卖充公”。因而对共产党、解放军非常仇视。在临汾解放后，他从许多的具体事实体验中，思想才有了转变，认识到共产党才真是人民的救星。下面是他自己思想转变的经过：
    我名叫李隽尧，在东关开鞋庄，四月十日那天下午，被六六师抓去，进城里抬伤兵，刚一进城，解放军就打进了东关，那时我心里一阵疼、一阵酸，担心我的老婆和孩子们的生命，后来想到就是没打死老婆也会被解放军“奸淫”，孩子也不知道要遭些什么罪，心里焦急得一夜没睡着。可是我又想：“解放军也是中国人，为什么会那样‘残忍’呢？”我不能证明我那一个想法是对的。当时我在求天保佑，不能叫东西都丢了，也不要把我的老婆孩子们杀死。
    第二天，满城恶风暴雨来到了，这个说：“某某经理叫‘共匪’打死了。”那个说：“某某经理的太太叫解放军把衣服脱光，拉到关外了。”街上也贴满了军报，有一张上画着一个被“共匪”脱得赤身露体的女人，站在墙下，我似乎觉得我的女人也是这样的，我马上晕倒了，我恨共产党不该那么“残忍”，不该把我的老婆孩子都活活害死。
    从此我无家可归了，就住在城内茂盛永牛掌柜那里，他也有个小孩，和我的孩子一样大，每当那个孩子叫他爸妈的时候，我想起了自己的孩子，心里就难过起来，整天整天饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着。
    到五月十七日晚上，解放军又打进城来，我心想这要完蛋了，孩子们都死了，连我也不能活，我和牛掌柜一家人都挤在一个地洞里，等着解放军来杀我们。那知事实并非是猜想的那样坏，每一个解放军进来了，都是和和气气的，并安慰我们说：“老乡受惊了，不要害怕，我们是解放军，打临汾就是为了救你们！”我们一面点头，一面却不相信他的话，心里想：“你们明明要杀我们，还要在装好人。”怀疑着解放军不知又耍什么鬼，等到天明了，还不见有人来杀我们，这时我还不敢相信。这时候，我急得拼死也要回我家看一看，可是牛掌柜和他家里人，都劝我不要走。到第三天，我再也忍不住了，于是偷偷跑回家来，进了门一看，一家人都在。我不相信我的眼，我当是活见了鬼，我的孩子看见我大喊一声，就跑来抓住我，叫着“爸爸回来了”，“爸爸回来了”，他妈大概已猜透了我的心思（因他老婆被民主政府转送到乡村后，遇到过一个被解放军在城墙抓来的俘虏，告她说过城里的情况）就笑着说：“你过来吧，呆什么，我们不是鬼！”接着他妈就说起来解放军怎样好，把他们转送到关外，政府又借粮食叫他们吃，他妈又说：“要不是解放军帮助咱，光没啥吃就把俺饿死了。”我听了老婆的话，又连想到那天在城里遇到的解放军安慰的话，这时才放下心来。老婆子领着我在家里，看了一遍，见到我们的东西都在，连柜上的鞋都没少一只，有些是零碎的东西，解放军也把他收拾起来，放到一个屋子里了。我从此明白了解放军真是“仁义之师”，我生在北平，到过太原和西安，走遍天下，从没见过这样好的队伍。顽固军那样的欺骗宣传，只不过是欺哄人民叫替他卖命就罢了，假仁假义总有一天会被人民看破的。　　　　　（会民）
