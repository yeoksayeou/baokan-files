[Report from our newspaper] After three rounds of resolving ideological problems among cadres in Xiyang, village cadres have stabilized their emotions and are actively leading production. After completing planting, they have taken advantage of the spare time to organize sideline production, which has yielded great results. In Lin Huangpu, in the seventh district, the entire village has 62 households with 194 people. At the time of planting, five households with 16 people had no food. This later developed to nine households with more than 30 people. Before the wheat harvest, 14 households with 46 people had no food, and an estimated 13 *shi* of grain were needed. After discussing and calculating this, it was proposed to organize and "rely on the mountain for a living, plugging the holes." A Production to Overcome Famine Committee was established, and specific tasks were assigned based on each person's strengths. Led by village cadres, mutual assistance and mutual benefit were implemented. As a result, in addition to ensuring full seedlings on the flat land, in terms of sideline production, the entire village earned 720,000 yuan in one month by cutting small sticks (each stick averaging 17 yuan). 13,150 sticks were also stored. Now, seven people have been organized to go to the mountains more than ten *li* away from the village to cut wood, and more than 10,000 sticks have been cut (the cut sticks are used in large quantities for making textile tools). There are only concerns about not being able to produce enough goods, and selling them is not a problem. The difficulties of households with no or little food have been greatly reduced. In Heshang Village, in the fifth district, with 97 households and 389 people, 22 households had no food. A portion of fruit grain was used to solve the immediate difficulties. After planting was completed, different production self-rescue efforts were organized according to different skills. Under the leadership of Zhao Chengfu, three groups totaling 16 people were organized to extract asphalt and black resin. A total of 91 workdays were used, with 130 *jin* of asphalt extracted (450 yuan per *jin*) and 350 *jin* of black resin (240 yuan per *jin*), earning a total of 142,500 yuan. The cooperative also organized a large number of laborers to dig up medicinal herbs, which the cooperative collected. Zhao Gengyue also led a group of four people to boil saltpeter. In Beimu Village in the second district, under the personal leadership of the village chief, households with no food were organized to boil saltpeter. Within a month, a net profit of 20 *shi* of corn was earned, compensating for the famine. (Office, Bin Yuan, Yan Shu)
