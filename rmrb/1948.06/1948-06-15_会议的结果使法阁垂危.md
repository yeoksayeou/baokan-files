Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 12th: Paris dispatch: The outcome of the London Six-Power Conference, which was unfavorable to France, has caused an uproar in French public opinion, and the Schumann government's position is precarious. *L'Humanité* published an article on the 3rd stating: "Bidault wants others to believe that he has obtained major concessions from the United States, and the United States is also happy to participate in this charade. They can be generous on minor issues because they have achieved their basic goal and established governments in the Ruhr and Frankfurt (referring to the location of the West German government in the US-UK plan). Since this is the case, the seasoning with which we are devoured is not important; what is important is that Krupp and German companies remain the sole masters of West Germany." The article pointed out that the decisions taken at the London Conference have already caused confusion among the "pro-American parties" (referring to the current ruling parties in France and the Gaullist faction, etc.). The right wing is also attacking Bidault, and it is very likely that some French trusts that favor the restoration of West German policy feel generous because the London resolutions have given too much to the United States. *Franc-Tireur* wrote: "The result of the London Conference proves the complete failure of French foreign policy." In the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Bidault repeatedly postponed reporting on the situation of the London Conference, and a protest was lodged again on the 2nd. Regardless of the Schumann authorities' attempts to delay, the question of France's position in the Six-Power Conference has been included on the agenda of the National Assembly, which will reconvene on the 8th. According to a United Press dispatch on the 5th, the tense situation has made the fate of the Schumann cabinet and Foreign Minister Bidault precarious. Bidault's friends are very alarmed, and they hope that Truman or Marshall can give the French public another guarantee of the danger of future German aggression before a parliamentary battle.

　　会议的结果使法阁垂危
    【新华社陕北十二日电】巴黎消息：伦敦六国会议之不利于法国的结果，使法国舆论哗然，舒曼政府的地位岌岌可危。人道报于三日著文称：“比道尔要别人相信他取得了美国的极大让步，美国方面也欣然参与此一把戏，他们可以在次要问题上表现慷慨，因为他们已达到基本目的并成立鲁尔与法兰克福（按即美英计划中的西德政府所在地）政府。既然如此，我们被人吞食时用什么调料就不是重要的问题了，重要的是克莱及德国公司仍是西德的唯一主宰。”该文指出伦敦会议采取的决定已在“亲美党”（按指法国现行当政各党及戴高乐派等）中间引起了混乱。右派也攻击起比道尔来了，很可能某些赞成恢复西德政策的法国托辣斯，因为伦敦决议给予美美太多而感到慷慨。“义勇军报”写道：“伦敦会议的结果，证明法国外交政策的完全失败。”在议会外交委员会方面，由于比道尔一再推迟报告伦敦会议的情形，特于二日再次提出抗议。不顾舒曼当局的拖延企图，关于法国在六国会议中的地位问题，已被列入八日复会的国民议会议程中。道一紧张形势，据合众社五日消息，已使舒曼内阁及外长比道尔的命运岌岌可危。比道尔的友人已甚惊慌，他们希望杜鲁门或马歇尔能在议会内的一场角斗前，就未来德国侵略的危险再给法国公众一个保证。
