　　Snippets of U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against China
    ◇ The Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), manipulated by the United States, has decided to allocate US$4 million to establish agricultural machinery branch companies in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Changsha, and other places in order to comply with the U.S. agricultural aggression against South China and monopolize the manufacture of agricultural implements in various regions. The company's general factory was originally located in Shanghai, and it has now been decided to expand its business to include industrial production.
    ◇ Northwest Airlines of the United States plans to establish an Eastern headquarters in Shanghai. Zheng Kang, the company's deputy manager for the Eastern region, has been in Shanghai for several months conducting "investigations" "in order to determine the transportation equipment required for airline routes."
    ◇ The United States has formally obtained control over Taiwan's electricity through a "loan." The Chiang Kai-shek Taiwan Power Company requested a US$12.7 million loan from the United States to repair and expand Taiwan's power plants. The first batch of US$2 million loan agreements was signed in Shanghai on April 1.
