Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th. The coal production in Xinjiang, Hejin, and other counties in southwestern Shanxi is very abundant, and it is supplied to Yuncheng, Ronghe, Gequan, Yanjin, and other places on the south bank of the Fen River. This spring, the Hejin County Democratic Government Trade Bureau issued in-kind loans worth 150,000 yuan in agricultural currency to help the local people organize coal transportation and sales in order to facilitate transportation in various places. Now, the county has increased its livestock by more than 200 heads. Each head can earn a large peck of wheat by transporting coal fifty miles. The two coal transportation stations opened by the Trade Bureau have transported and sold 4 million catties of coal from March to date. The Xinjiang County Farmers Association has signed a contract with the Yuncheng Salt Affairs Administration to exchange 200,000 catties of Xinjiang coal for Yuncheng edible salt. At present, transportation is developed in the area, and there is a constant stream of vehicles and horses on the main roads north and south of the Fen River.
