Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 27th: A unit directly under the East China People's Liberation Army is engaging in thrift and disaster relief while rectifying and training, and also assisting farmers in the villages where they are stationed with production. The unit has saved a total of 36,900 catties of millet, more than 1,914,000 Jicha bills, more than 2,700 pieces of clothing, and 176 silver dollars. The cultural troupe also held benefit performances, using the proceeds to help disaster victims. A total of 1,151 households and 3,283 people received assistance. A certain hospital donated more than 20,000 catties of millet and more than 262,000 Jicha bills; another unit also donated more than 58,000 catties of grain, 830,000 Jicha bills, four silver dollars, and more than 2,000 pieces of clothing to help the local farmers overcome the difficult famine. Before the troops moved, many companies voluntarily went to the fields to help the masses harvest wheat, and held army-civilian get-togethers to bid farewell to the masses. Both the soldiers and the masses said, "We feel really sad, just like brothers separating." When the People's Liberation Army set off for the front lines, the villagers gathered at the entrance of the village to offer the soldiers cigarettes, vegetables, and wine. An old man cooked two baskets of fish late at night and brought wine to send off the soldiers. Another old man in his sixties, who was still sick, had to be helped out by others to see the troops off. Many soldiers were moved by the deep feelings of the masses. The villagers affectionately told the soldiers: "Take care on your journey, come back and visit when you leave this place, and write letters!" Some people said with tears in their eyes, "After we wear the clothes you comrades have given us and eat the grain you have helped us grow, we will miss you!" After the soldiers persuaded them several times, the masses reluctantly said goodbye to the soldiers.

    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十七日电】华东人民解放军直属队一部，在整军练兵中从事节约救灾并帮助驻村农民生产。该部共节约小米三万六千九百斤，冀钞一百九十一万四千余元。衣物二千七百余件，银元一七六个。文工团并举行义演，以所得救济灾民，一一五一户、三二八三人得到救济。某医院捐献小米二万余斤，冀钞二十六万二千余元；另部亦捐出粮食五万八千余斤，冀钞八十三万元，银元四枚，衣物二千余斤，帮助了驻地农民渡过艰难的灾荒。部队移动前许多连队自动下地帮助群众割麦，并开军民联欢会向群众告别。战士和群众都说：“咱们象亲兄弟分离一样，心里真难受。”当开赴前线的解放军出发时，老乡们群集村头，向战士们敬烟、敬菜、敬酒。一位老人深夜煮好两筐鱼，打了酒，来替战士们饯行。另一位尚在病中的六十多岁的老人，要别人扶着他出来给部队送行。许多战士为群众这种深挚感情所感动。老乡们亲切的向战士们叮咛着：“你们好好走啊，离这边时的要过来玩，要写信来呀！”有些群众流着泪说：“以后穿起了同志们救济的衣服，吃到了你们帮耕的粮食，就会想念起你们啊！”经战士们几次劝说，群众才依依不舍的和战士告别。
