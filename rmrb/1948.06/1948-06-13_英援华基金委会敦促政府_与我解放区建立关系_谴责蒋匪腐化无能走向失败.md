Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch: The British Aid China Fund held its annual meeting in London on the 3rd and issued a statement urging the British government to establish economic and cultural relations with the democratic government of the Chinese Liberated Areas. The policy statement adopted by the committee stated that "the development of the Chinese situation is of great importance to the world situation." Britain's emphasis on "establishing economic and cultural relations with the North China regime (referring to the democratic government of the Chinese Liberated Areas) will be beneficial to both sides" and "will reduce the threat to world peace." The statement condemned Britain's current policy, "making people think that Britain has recognized China as a sphere of influence of the United States and no longer cares about maintaining friendly relations with China." The statement analyzed the Chinese situation, stating: "The CCP army (referring to the Chinese People's Liberation Army) is equipping itself with captured American supplies and equipment, and now controls one-third of China's territory and is advancing steadily." On the other hand, "it is now clear that the Nanjing regime cannot be expected to have democratic reforms or stability, and a government supported by the people. Despite large-scale American aid, it is still accelerating towards economic and financial chaos and military failure." In its statement, the British Aid China Fund reviewed the past work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China, stating: "The UNRRA's huge aid program to China has been completely undermined by corruption, incompetence, political discrimination, and the Chinese government's use of three-quarters of its revenue for civil war. Most of UNRRA's supplies to China (of which the United Kingdom donated 8 million pounds) were machinery and other major items, but they were abandoned on the docks to rust and sold to the highest bidders to obtain cash for the government's purposes." It is reported that the British Aid China Fund was established during the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and its leaders included Mrs. Cripps, Mrs. Sze, Laski, and others.

　　英援华基金委会敦促政府
  　与我解放区建立关系
    谴责蒋匪腐化无能走向失败
    【新华社陕北十日电】法新社伦敦三日电称：英国援华基金委员会三日于伦敦举行年会，发表声明，要求英国政府与中国解放区民主政府建立经济及文化之关系。该会所通过之政策声明，认为“中国情势之发展，对世界局势具有巨大重要性。”英国重“与华北政权（指中国解放区民主政府）建立经济与文化的关系，将对双方俱属有利”，“并将减少对世界和平之威胁”。声明中谴责英国现行政策“使人认为英国已承认中国为美国之势力范围，并已不复关怀，尽中国之友好关系。”声明分析中国情势称：“中共军队（指中国人民解放军）以所缴获之美国物资装备自己，现已控制中国三分之一地区，且在节节前进中。”而在另一方面，“现已明白不能期望南京政权有民主改革或稳定，及为人民拥护之政府。尽管美国大规模援助，但始终在加速走向经济与财政混乱以及军事失败。”英国援华基金委员会在该项声明中检讨联合国救济总署过去的援华工作时称：“联总援华之巨大计划，已为贪污腐化颟顸无能政治歧视，及中国政府以岁入四分之三用于内战所破坏无遗。联总对华供应品（其中不列颠联合王国捐赠了八百万镑）大部分为机器及其他主要物品，但被弃置码头上，任其生锈，并售予出价最高之投标人，以换取现金为政府之目的而支用。”按英国援华基金委员会成立于中国抗日战争期间，其领导人物包括克利浦斯夫人、司徒永夫人、拉斯基等。
