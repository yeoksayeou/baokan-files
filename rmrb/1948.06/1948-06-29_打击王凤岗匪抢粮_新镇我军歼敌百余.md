On the 16th and 19th, a unit of our army made a surprise attack on Wulizhuang on the Jinpu Railway, clearing out strongholds such as Yingguantun and Tangguantun. On the night of the 20th, our army crossed the Grand Canal, destroyed the railway section from Jinghai to Chenguantun, demolished eight enemy roadside bunkers and more than ten pillboxes, and harvested more than 20 li of telephone wires. Wang Bandit's Brigade (originally formed from Wang Fenggang's First, Second, and Third Regiments) in the Daqing River area, raided areas around Xinzhen Kaikou, Gegezhuang, Hongcheng, and Mawaitou in three routes on the 21st, attempting to seize wheat on a large scale. On the afternoon of the same day, they were suddenly surrounded by our army in villages such as Hegang. After fierce fighting until 4:00 AM on the 22nd, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled in disarray. Preliminary statistics show that over a hundred puppet bandits were captured alive, over thirty puppet bandits were killed or wounded, and five light and heavy machine guns, one 60mm mortar, over a hundred rifles and carbines, and three warhorses were seized.
