Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st – The struggle of Indian peasants seizing land from landlords is unfolding. According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi: Adult Indian peasants receive a daily food ration of only six ounces of corn, but even this meager ration is not regularly distributed. Landlords are effectively taking all the harvest from tenant farmers, and even reclaiming the land. Peasants protested to the local National Congress Party committee, but received no support. Landlords are using force to drive out peasants, which has sparked peasant resistance in many areas. In the Gorakhpur region, over four hundred tenant farmers seized 1,100 acres of land from landlords and declared it their own. Some peasants occupied irrigation canals. Police were ordered to come out to beat the peasants, rob their property, and burn their houses. Large numbers of peasants have been arrested. In the Zubanga region, 1,400 peasants are about to be put on trial.

　　反抗地主残酷剥削
    印度农民夺取土地
    【新华社陕北一日电】印度农民自地主手中夺取土地的斗争正在展开。据塔斯社德里讯：印度成年农民，每人每日的粮食配给只有玉米六两，但甚至这种吃不饱的配给粮，也不能正常地发给，地主实际上拿走了佃户的全部收成，甚至还要收回土地。农民向国大党地方委员会提出抗议，还是没有得到支持。地主以武力驱逐农民，因而在许多地区都激起了农民的反抗。在哥拉克浦地区，四百余佃户自地主手中夺得了一千一百英亩土地，并且宣布归他们所有，有的农民占用了灌溉的河渠，奉命警察出动殴打农民，抢劫他们的财产，燃毁他们的房屋，大批农民遭受逮捕。在舟班加地区，有一千四百名农民即将受审。
