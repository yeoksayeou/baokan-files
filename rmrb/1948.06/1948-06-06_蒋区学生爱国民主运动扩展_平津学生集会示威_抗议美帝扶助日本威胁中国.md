Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive foreign news agency reports: The patriotic and democratic student movement in the Jiang-controlled areas has expanded from Nanjing and Shanghai to North and South China. On May 30th, several thousand students (Associated Press reported approximately 3,500, United Press stated 3,000) from universities in Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan held a joint demonstration rally at Peking University in Beijing to protest against US imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression forces threatening China. Despite being surrounded by Jiang government military police outside the campus, the students enthusiastically shouted slogans and decided to send telegrams to the US State Department and MacArthur to protest. The telegram stated: "Under your (referring to MacArthur) protection, Japan is once again embarking on the path of fascism. We angrily protest this act of betraying the Allied powers." The conference also telegraphed the International Student Union in Prague, requesting students from other countries to assist in opposing US policy towards Japan. Prior to the demonstration rally, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University had each held meetings on their respective campuses. Tsinghua University has decided to hold a week-long protest movement. All three universities have successively held "US Policy Towards Japan" opinion polls. In the Peking University answers, the vast majority of students believe that as a result of US imperialism cultivating Japan as an "anti-communist fortress," Japanese imperialism is reviving, and China "will be the first to suffer from the revival of Japan." Several professors at the university stated on the 25th that they "stand in solidarity with the students" in this movement.
    In Xiamen, several hundred students from Xiamen University held a patriotic demonstration on May 28th (some say the 29th), posting slogans throughout the city such as "US troops get out," "US imperialism is the peddler of the Third World War," and "US aid to Japan policy endangers China."

　　蒋区学生爱国民主运动扩展
  　平津学生集会示威
    抗议美帝扶助日本威胁中国
    【新华社陕北三日电】综合外国通讯社消息：蒋区学生爱国民主运动，已由宁、沪扩展至华北、华南。五月三十日，平、津、唐山各大学学生数千人（美联社报导约三千五百余名，合众社称三千人），在平市北京大学举行联合示威大会，抗议美帝扶植日本侵略势力复活威胁中国。到会学生不顾校外蒋政府军警包围，仍热烈高呼口号，并决定分电美国国务院及麦克阿瑟，提出抗议。电文中指出：“在你（指麦克阿瑟）的保护下，日本又走上法西斯主义的道路，我们愤怒抗议此种背叛盟邦的行为。”大会并电布拉格国际学联，要求其他国家学生协助反对美国对日政策。在示威大会之前，北大、清华、燕京等校曾分别在校内召开会议。清华已决定举行为期一周的抗议运动。三校均先后举行“美国对日政策”民意测验。北大答案中，绝大多数学生，均认为由于美帝培植日本为“反共堡垒”的结果，日本帝国主义已在复活，中国“将首先受日本复活之害”。该校若干教授二十五日表示，在此一运动中“与学生们团结一致”。
    在厦门，厦大学生数百人，于五月二十八日（一说为二十九日）举行爱国示威，在全市张贴“美军滚出去”，“美帝国主义是第三次世界大战的贩子”，“美国援日政策危害中国”等标语。
