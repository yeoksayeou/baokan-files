How Yuanshi Leads the Sowing Campaign?
    Su Zhifang
    On the 7th of this month, there was a thorough rain. The Yuanshi County Production Committee immediately issued a call to "urgently mobilize and rush to sow and replant" on the same day, requiring all cadres and the masses in the county to immediately stop all secondary work and plant all wheat stubble fields, seedling-deficient fields, and wasteland, leaving no acre uncultivated. It called on the old districts to carry forward the experience of organizing production during the Anti-Japanese War, immediately rectify mutual aid, and enter sowing; the new districts should develop and improve the old exchange labor methods of the masses, organize people to pull carts and seed drills, and overcome the difficulties of lacking livestock. Furthermore, it called for carrying forward the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual relief to solve the difficulties of the disaster-stricken people in farming, such as living difficulties, seeds, and farm tools.
    In actual practice, the districts and villages generally grasped it very tightly. Before the rain stopped, the district and village cadres mobilized the masses to prepare for sowing. Beisu Village held a mass meeting during the rain to discuss sowing and formulate a plan: men and women should work together to finish planting in five days. Laidao Village organized the masses to repair farm tools and set up partnerships (mutual aid) during the rain, and exchanged and borrowed seeds. Dongzheng Village in the Sixth District made the above preparations. It also exchanged five dou of millet stored in the village grain store for the masses, borrowed one shi of black beans (relief grain) for households with difficulties (including landlords and rich peasants with difficulties), and borrowed some fruit grain for the masses to exchange for seeds at the market. It also mobilized the masses to help each other and borrow from each other. It suggested that women grind flour themselves during the sowing period to free up livestock for production.
    Many villages lacked farm tools, and the usage time of each seed drill was scheduled during sowing. Beisu Village had only fourteen seed drills for more than two hundred households, and Laixiang Village had only twelve for one hundred and seventy households. People used them during naps and at night to fully utilize their effectiveness, and as a result, the sowing was not slow.
    The common practice of organizing people to pull seed drills and carts eliminated the impact of the lack of livestock on sowing. Hei Xiaozi and Li Dangzheng of Nanwu Association and two others worked together to pull a seed drill, planting eight mu in half a day. Li Jidou and Wu Erbai had no livestock, so they first helped households with livestock finish planting, and then used other people's livestock to plant their own, finishing all the planting in two and a half days. The widow Shao Fuxiang had no labor, so she made a pair of shoes for a bachelor in exchange for planting. Su Danai, a sixty-year-old woman from Laixiang Village, and her daughter-in-law pulled a seed drill together, planting two mu in one morning. In Beisu Village, Zhang Lianzhen and three other households helped each other pull a seed drill, completing all the wheat stubble fields in four days and replanting three mu of millet. Fifty-eight households in the whole village pulled by people and thirty-one households with livestock completed sowing at the same time. Li Xixiang also planted two mu of wasteland that had not been planted for five or six years.
    In addition to general calls and arrangements, many village cadres also conducted in-depth inspections and promotions. Production committee members in Beisu, Laixiang and other villages arranged work and conducted inspections and supervision of each area and street at any time. Many women who had never sown before participated in the sowing under their encouragement, making the men work even harder. Dongzheng and other villages organized nightly broadcasts and mass blackboards, praising the good and criticizing the bad every day, which played a considerable role.
    Due to the tight grasp of the leadership, the enthusiasm of the masses was discovered, their difficulties were solved, and various preparations were made. Most areas started from the 8th and finished planting by the 11th or 12th. Nanwu Association in the Fourth District and Beisu Village in the Sixth District were both new districts, and the speed at which they completed sowing was astonishing despite the difficulties of lacking livestock, farm tools, and disasters: Nanwu Association completed the sowing and replanting of 1,769 mu of wheat stubble fields and seedling-deficient fields in two and a half days. Dongzheng Village finished planting all 800 mu in two days. Wannian Village planted 1,531 mu in four days and replanted 344 mu of millet. Now, most villages in the county have turned to weeding.

　　元氏是怎样领导下种运动的？
    苏指方
    本月七日落了透雨，元氏县生产委员会当天就发出“紧急动员起来抢种补种”的号召，要求全县干部与群众马上停止一切次要工作，把所有麦茬地，缺苗地及荒地全部种上，不荒一亩。要求老区发扬抗日时期组织生产的经验，立即整顿互助，进入下种；新区要把群众旧有的换工办法加以发展提高，组织人拉车、人拉耧，克服缺乏牲口的困难。并发扬互助互济精神，解除灾民耕种中的生活困难及种籽、农具等困难。
    在实际进行中，各区村一般都抓得很紧，雨还没停，区村干部即分头动员群众准备下种。北苏村在下雨当中就召开了群众会，讨论下种，订出计划：男女齐动手，五天种完。来到村下雨时就组织群众修好农具，搭好伙计（互助），换借好种籽。六区东正村作了上述的那些准备。还把本村粮店存的五斗黍子换给群众，把存的一石黑豆（救济粮）借给困难户（其中包括有困难的地主富农），把一部果实粮借给群众，到集上换种籽。并发动群众互助互借。对妇女提出在下种期间自己推磨，腾出牲口生产。
    许多村庄农具缺乏，下种时把每只耧的使用时间都排好了。北苏村二百多户只有十四张耧，来厢村一百七十户只有十二张。午睡与黑夜都有人使用，充分发挥了他们的效用，结果种的也不慢。
    普通组织人拉耧，人拉车，使牲口缺乏没有影响了下种。南吴会的黑小子和李党正等三人变工拉耧，半天种了八亩。李吉斗和吴二白没牲口，便先帮有牲口户种完，然后用人家的牲口种自己的，两天半全部种上。寡妇邵福祥没劳力，给一个光棍汉做了双鞋，换工种上。来厢村六十岁的苏大奶和她媳妇伙拉耧，一早晨种了二亩。北苏村张连振等三家互助人拉耧，四天种完全部麦茬地，还补种了三亩谷。全村五十八户人拉的，三十一户人配牲口的，都同时完成下种。李喜祥把五、六年没种的二亩荒地也种了。
    许多村干除一般的号召与布置外，同时做了深入的检查推广。北苏、来厢等村生产委员们布置了工作，随时进行分片分街的检查督促。不少过去从未下过地的妇女，在他们鼓舞下参加了下种，使得男人们也更加卖力气。东正等村组织了夜间广播和大众黑板，每天表扬好的，批评坏的，起了相当作用。
    由于领导上抓得紧，发现了群众的积极性，解决了他们的困难，做好了各种准备，大部地区从八号开始，到十一、二号就种完了。四区南吴会、六区北苏等村都是新区，在缺少牲口农具与灾荒等困难下，完成下种之快是惊人的：南吴会两天半全部完成了一千七百六十九亩麦茬地和缺苗地的下种补种。东正村两天将八百亩全部种完。万年村四天种完一千五百三十一亩，还补栽谷子三百四十四亩。现在全县大部村庄都已转入锄苗。
