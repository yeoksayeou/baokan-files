　　British Trade Minister to Visit Soviet Union
  　Reopening Anglo-Soviet Business Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th] London dispatch: British Cabinet Trade Minister Wilson will soon lead a delegation to the Soviet Union to continue business negotiations between the two countries. According to the Anglo-Soviet trade schedule (signed last December), five months after the agreement is implemented, the two governments should send representatives to review payment status and formulate a cargo balance plan. Wilson told the House of Commons on the 1st that he had raised the above opinions to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain and suggested a meeting this week to discuss preparations for his trip to Moscow. It is also learned that the London "Star" wrote at the end of last month when discussing Soviet trade relations: "Today's needs require expanding Anglo-Soviet trade far beyond pre-war levels. Small and gradual development will not meet the requirements of 1949."

　　英贸易大臣将赴苏
  　重开英苏商务谈判
    【新华社陕北七日电】伦敦消息：英阁贸易大臣威尔逊即将率领代表团赴苏，继续两国之商务谈判。按照英苏贸易日程（去年十二月签订）之规定，在协定实行五个月后，两国政府应互派代表检讨付款情况，并拟订运货之平衡计划。威氏于一日告下院称：他已将上项意见向苏驻英大使提出，并建议于本周内会议一次，以讨论他去莫斯科之应行准备事项。又悉：伦敦“星报”于上月底撰文论及苏贸易关系时指出：“今天的需要，要求扩展英苏贸易至远超过战前的规模，细小而逐渐的发展，将不能满足一九四九年的要求”。
