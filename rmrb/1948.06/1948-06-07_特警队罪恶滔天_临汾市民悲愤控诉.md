　　The Special Task Force's Heinous Crimes:
  　Linfen Citizens Angrily Accuse

    [This newspaper's Jinan Frontline, 4th dispatch] Linfen citizens have been accusing the Special Task Force, a gang of murderous devils, stating: They commit murders by assassination at night. On the night of May 4th, the Special Task Force dragged dozens of "disguised" elements outside the West Gate to be buried alive and thrown into the river. In the Lotus Pond northwest of the Drum Tower, there is a dirt pit more than a foot deep and wide, filled with corpses and covered with dirt. South of the Iron Buddha Temple, there is a large well, and it is unknown how many corpses have been thrown into it. On the 29th, the government sent people to retrieve 60-odd corpses. The remaining corpses had already rotted and were mixed with the soil. The people collecting the corpses saw that the heads and faces of the retrieved corpses were rotten, and they could not recognize which one was their relative. They said very indignantly, "The bandit Yan who kills people and burns corpses will not die a good death." It is reported that the Special Task Force is a special agent organ directly led by the Taiyuan Military Police Joint Inspection Office. After the People's Liberation Army broke the city, the Special Task Force Captain Kong Xiangshun, Special Task Force Leader Mao Shixun, and more than 50 others below them were captured by us and are currently under interrogation.

　　特警队罪恶滔天
  　临汾市民悲愤控诉
    【本报晋南前线四日电】临汾市民纷纷控诉杀人魔王特警队的罪行称：他们杀人都在夜间暗杀，五月四日晚，特警队曾把数十名“伪装”分子拉到西门外活埋、投河。鼓楼西北的莲花池，有一个丈余深宽的土坑，被死尸填满，用土覆蒙起来。铁佛寺南面有一口大水井，不知填了多少尸首。二十九日，政府派人捞出尸体六十余具，剩下的尸体已经腐烂，和泥土混成一片。收尸人看见捞出的尸首，头面腐烂，认不出那一个是自己的亲属，非常悲愤的说：“阎贼杀人烧尸不得好死”。按特警队为太原军警审联合稽察处直接领导的特务机关，解放军破城后，特警队长孔祥顺，特警组长毛世勋等以下五十余人，均被我俘获，现正在审讯中。
