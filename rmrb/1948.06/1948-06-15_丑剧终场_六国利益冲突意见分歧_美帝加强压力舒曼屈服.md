  　Six Nations' Interests Clash, Opinions Diverge; US Imperialism Intensifies Pressure, Schuman Yields
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: A comprehensive report: The second session of the London Six-Nation Conference, which aimed to split Germany, concluded on June 1st. This session began on April 20th and lasted for 38 days. During the conference, there were many differences of opinion between the United States and its partners—Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—especially between the US and France, "reflecting the conflict of interests of Western countries." (Soviet Labor News). At the first meeting from February 23rd to March 6th, the six countries had "in principle" agreed to international control of the Ruhr industrial region. However, after the Marshall Plan was passed by the US Congress, US imperialists felt they had new means to exert pressure on their partners. Therefore, at the second meeting, the United States insisted that the international co-management of the Ruhr should be limited to controlling the "distribution" of raw materials, and that its power should be purely advisory. The real masters of the Ruhr could only be Hoffman, the executor of the Marshall Plan in Washington, and Clay, the US military commander in Germany. At the same time, the US demanded that a West German constituent assembly elected by "universal suffrage" be convened on September 1st to quickly establish a West German government. The French monopoly capitalist group feared the extreme dissatisfaction of the French people and was troubled by the US and British conspiracy to control the Ruhr, in which they only obtained a "back seat". Because of this, according to reports from the Associated Press on May 25th and 26th, the French delegation suddenly declared "retreat" on the grounds that the authority of the Ruhr control agency was insufficient to guarantee French security, striking a pose of "we are not taking risks", and demanded that the United States give it military security guarantees. However, the US representatives not only ignored this, but the American newspapers also openly threatened France, saying that if it did not yield to the US, the "aid" it could obtain from the Marshall Plan would be stopped. Obviously, the Schuman government, which could not survive without "US aid," had no choice but to yield. In order to save face for Schuman and Bidault, the United States made some "concessions" on minor issues, such as slightly relaxing the power of the Ruhr control agency, ensuring that the electoral law for the West German constituent assembly on September 1st would comply with the French federalist views as much as possible, and temporarily shelving the issue of merging the French-occupied zones.

  　六国利益冲突意见分歧　美帝加强压力舒曼屈服
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报道：分裂德国的伦敦六国会议，其第二次会议已于六月一日宣告闭会。这次会议开始于四月二十日，持续了三十八天，会议进行中美国及其伙伴——英、法、比、荷、卢五国之间，特别是美、法之间的意见有很多分歧，“反映了西方各国利益的冲突。”（苏劳动报）在二月二十三日至三月六日的第一次会议上，六国原曾在“原则上”同意国际管制鲁尔工业，但当马歇尔计划在美国会通过后，美帝国主义分子已为它已握有对其伙伴们施行压力的新手段，因此，在第二次会议上美国坚主鲁尔的国际共管限于管制生产品的“分配”，而其权力亦纯属咨询性质，鲁尔的真正主人只能是华盛顿的马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼及德境美军司令克莱，同时美国并要求于九月一日召开由“普选”产生的西德立宪议会，赶快成立西德政府；法国垄断资本集团恐惧法国人民的极度不满并困恼于美、英控制鲁尔的阴谋中他们只得到“末席”的地位。由于这样，据合众社五月廿五、二十六日报导，法国代表团突然以鲁尔管制机构之权限不足以保障法国安全为理由，宣告“退缩”，摆出“我们不冒险”的姿势，并要求美国给它以军事安全的保障；可是美国代表对此不仅不加理睬，而且美国报纸还公开威吓法国说：假如它不向美国屈服，则将停止其可获得的马歇尔计划的“援助”。显然，离开了“美援”就不能生活的舒曼政府就只得屈服了。为了保持舒曼、比道尔的面子，美国在次要问题上则作了些“让步”，如鲁尔管制机构的权力稍稍放宽，九月一日西德立宪议会的选举法将尽量符合法方联邦制的观点，法占区的合并问题暂时搁起等。
