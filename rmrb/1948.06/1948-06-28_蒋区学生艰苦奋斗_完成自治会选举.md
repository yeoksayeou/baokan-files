Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: A comprehensive report: Over the past six months, students from Qinghua University, Peking University, and Yanjing University in Beiping; Nankai University and Peiyang University in Tianjin; Jiaotong University Engineering College in Tangshan; Zhejiang University in Hangzhou; and Wuhan University in Wuchang, disregarding the "Revised Regulations for Student Unions in Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" promulgated by the Kuomintang Ministry of Education last December, which deprived students of the right to democratically elect their student unions, have successively completed democratic student union elections in March and April of this year after arduous struggles. According to a Nanjing dispatch in the May 1st issue of Shanghai's "Observation" weekly, students at Nanjing Central University, who have repeatedly suffered persecution for insisting on electing student unions based on democratic principles, established the "Student Department Autonomous Federation" on April 21st. To celebrate the establishment of the "Autonomous Federation," more than 2,000 students from Central University held a celebration meeting that evening. At the meeting, students recited congratulatory messages: "On the front line of battle, we fall and rise again. With hands fighting for freedom, we raise again the blood-stained banner..." Representatives from Jinling University presented a flag to the school with the inscription: "We are forever together." Representatives from Jinling Women's University also repeatedly expressed their desire to strengthen ties in their congratulatory messages. The students and representatives from various schools were in high spirits. After the meeting was adjourned, they were reluctant to leave and collectively performed the Yangge dance to the beat of drums, holding hands and singing "Unity is Strength."

On January 29th of this year, when students from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, and St. John's University were bidding farewell to students from Tongji University who were going to Nanjing to petition for autonomous rights, they were arrested by the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek government authorities, resulting in 120 arrests and 30 to 40 injuries, creating the "Tongji Bloodshed Incident" that shocked China and the world. However, all this brutal persecution did not suppress the students in Shanghai. Instead, it aroused their more heroic struggle for democracy and against oppression, and developed into the recent continuous anti-American support-for-Japan movement among Shanghai students. Seven days after the "Tongji Bloodshed Incident," more than 3,000 students from various schools in Beiping held a "Anti-Persecution, For Democracy, Support Tongji Bloodshed Incident, Protest Illegal Arrests, Accusation Demonstration Meeting" at Peking University on February 7th. At the meeting, everyone stood in solemn silence to swear "to defend our democratic student union" and recited the declaration of eight universities in Beiping and Tianjin against the "Revised Regulations for Student Unions in Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" for the second time. Students from universities in Beiping and Tianjin completed the democratic general election of student unions with great enthusiasm, and the number of voters was very high. For example, the number of voters at Peking University was 1,165, accounting for more than 75% of the 1,615 votes issued; Qinghua University accounted for more than 80%; and Peiyang University reached 90%. Therefore, the elected directors and supervisors of the student unions in various schools were all students with excellent character and learning who were most trusted by their classmates. Students from Wuhan University in Wuchang also overcame the obstacles of the Chiang Kai-shek party to complete the general election, with the number of voters reaching about 80% of all students. Students at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou completed the election of the student union under the slogan of "Oppose Appointment, Oppose Destruction; Fight for Democracy, Fight for Freedom." All of this shows that the political consciousness of students in the Chiang Kai-shek area is increasing with the maturity of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement.

　　蒋区学生艰苦奋斗
  　完成自治会选举
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：半年来北平的清华、北京、燕京，天津的南开、北洋，唐山的交大工学院，杭州的浙江，武昌的武汉等大学学生，不顾国民党教育部去年十二月所颁布剥夺学生民主选举自治会权利的“修正中等以上学校学生自治会规则”，经过艰难困苦的奋斗，已相继于今年三、四月间完成民主的学生自治会选举。据五月一日上海观察周刊南京通讯报导：坚持以民主原则选举学生会而多次遭受迫害的南京中央大学学生，已于四月二十一日成立“学生院系自治联合会”。为了庆祝“自治联”的成立，中大二千余学生于当晚举行联欢大会。会上学生朗诵祝词：“在战斗的最前线，我们倒下又站起。用争自由的双手，我们再擎起血染的大旗……”。金陵大学代表献给该校的旗帜写着：“我们永远在一起”，金陵女大代表也在祝词里再三表示加强联系的热望，学生们和各校代表情绪都很热烈，大会在宣布散会后他们还不肯走，就在锣鼓声中集体扭秧歌，拉起手来唱“团结就是力量”。
    今年一月二十九日，上海交通、复旦、暨南、圣约翰等大学学生，在欢送同济大学学生为争取自治权利赴南京请愿时，曾遭上海蒋政府当局捕去一百二十人，殴伤三、四十人，造成震惊中外的“同济血案”。但这一切残酷迫害，不怕没有压倒了上海学生，反而激起了学生们争民主反压迫的更英勇斗争，并发展为最近上海学生持续的反对美国扶日运动。在“同济血案”发生后的第七天，北平各校学生三千余人于二月七日在北大举行“反迫害、争民主、声援同济血案，抗议非法逮捕控诉示威大会”，会上全体肃立宣誓“保卫我们民主的自治会”，并朗诵平、津八大学再度反对“修正中等以上学校学生自治会规则”的宣言。平、津各大学学生在高度的热情下完成自治会的民主普选，投票人数甚为踊跃。例如北大投票人数一一六五人，占所发出票数一六一五的百分之七十五强；清华占百分之八十以上；北洋大学达百分之九十。因此各校所当选的自治会理事、监事，均为品学俱优平时最得同学信任者。武昌武大学生也排除蒋党阻碍完成普选，投票人数达全体学生百分之八十左右。杭州浙大学生则在“反钦定，反摧残；争民主，争自由”的口号下完成了自治会选举。所有这一切说明了蒋区学生政治上的觉悟，正随中国人民革命运动的成熟而日益提高。
