[Transmitted by] This Newspaper Jinan Front Line, 29th: More than five thousand citizens, workers, farmers, merchants, and students of Linfen gathered on May 28th to celebrate the new life of the people of Linfen. That morning, the citizens cleaned the streets early. To express their joy after liberation, the citizens posted various slogans and couplets at their doors: "The Communist Party is the re-birth parents of the people of Linfen," "Support the democratic government in building various policies for a new Linfen,"... such slogans were posted all over the city. The owner of Xiang Guang Le Zhuang on East Street, while busy welcoming customers, took time to write his own couplet: "Linfen Newly Liberated, All People Rejoice," and personally posted it at the door. As soon as the staff of the democratic government walked to the door of the shops, the merchants enthusiastically pulled them in to tell them about their suffering under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. Li Tongtai, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, relied on a small business to support his family of seventeen. During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, they couldn't even do business, and they were extorted more than twenty loads of grain in two or three months, and various donations were too numerous to count. Some shops couldn't afford the burden, and they couldn't even close down if they wanted to. Wang Zijang, a merchant from Beihongjialou, told me: Linfen had not been free for a single day from the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938] until liberation. When the Japanese were there, there were "entry and exit permits," "good citizen certificates," and "residence permits," which made it impossible for the people to even open their doors. After finally waiting for the victory of the War of Resistance, people thought that they should be free, but who knew that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan came and inherited the old Japanese "three-certificate policy," and people still had no freedom at all, and the rule was even more severe than the old Japanese. Anyone who dared to say a fair word was said to be a "disguised element" and detained to "confess and reform." How many lives have been harmed like this! Now that the Communist Party is here, there is freedom to enter and exit, and you don't need a pass to travel all over the liberated areas. The democratic government not only abolished exorbitant taxes and levies, but also provided grain and loans to help us. This is truly the first time that the people of Linfen have gained freedom. The celebration meeting officially began at 3:00 p.m. Mayor Shi of the Democratic City Government and Commissioner Shi of the Taiyue Second Special District personally attended and delivered speeches. They said: The victory of the Linfen campaign not only wiped out more than 25,000 enemy troops, but also liberated all the people of Linfen. Students will no longer be sent to the front lines by the bandit army as cannon fodder, and merchants will no longer be forced to work while starving. From now on, the day of everyone's new life has begun. When they talked about the various policies of the democratic government to build Linfen, smiles appeared on the faces of all the citizens, and they responded with warm applause. At the end of their speeches, Mayor Shi and Commissioner Shi called on the workers, farmers, merchants, students, and shop assistants of the city to unite and strive to build a new Linfen. Finally, all the citizens and schools above the municipal middle school presented banners to the People's Liberation Army, one with "Merit in Linfen" and the other with "Rescuing the People from Misery." The meeting lasted three hours and ended in laughter and joy. (Li Zemin)
    [Transmitted by] This Newspaper Jinan Front Line, 29th: During the rule of Yan Xishan's bandits, the lives of teachers in Linfen's secondary schools were extremely deteriorated. The salaries they received could not keep up with the soaring prices. For example, in March, the salary was 4 million Kuomintang currency, and each stone of wheat cost 6 million. In April, the salary increased to 8 or 9 million, and each stone of wheat rose to more than 10 million. Salaries doubled, but prices tripled. Under these circumstances, teachers could barely support themselves, and their families could not survive. In May, the schools did not pay salaries at all. Teachers reduced their meals from three to two a day, eating corn and sorghum flour without vegetables. They were so hungry that they could barely stand it, but the bandit army still grabbed them to do construction work. Teachers described their bad lives, saying: "Everyone calls me a scholar, but my life is not as good as a nanny's. I also look after children (referring to teaching students), but I can't eat enough and I'm not allowed to starve to death." They also said that being a teacher has "three can't afford," that is, "can't afford to live, can't afford to die (can't afford to buy a coffin when dead, use a straw mat), can't afford to be sick."

　　临汾人民庆祝新生
  　纷纷控诉蒋阎匪残暴统治
    【本报晋南前线二十九日电】临汾市民、工人、农民、商人、学生五千余人，于五月二十八日集会，庆祝临汾人民的新生。是日清晨，市民们一早就把街道打扫得干干净净。市民们为表达自己对于解放后的欢欣，又在门口张贴起来各色各样的标语和对联：“共产党是临汾市人民的再生父母”，“拥护民主政府建设新临汾的各种政策”、…………等标语贴满全市。东大街祥广乐庄的掌柜，一面忙着迎送顾客，一面抽空又自编了一付“临汾新解放，万民皆欢腾”的对子，亲自贴到门口。民主政府的工作人员一走到商店的门口，商人们就热情的把他拉进去诉说他们在蒋阎统治下的痛苦。商会会长李通泰全家十七口人，就靠着一个不大的买卖过生活。在蒋阎统治期间，连生意也不能做，两三个月里还被勒索走粮食二十余担，各种捐款更是多得无法计算。有些商店出不起负担，就是想关门也不能。北洪家楼商人王子江告我说：临汾自二十七年至解放前，就没自由过一天。日本人在时，有“出入证”、“良民证”、“居住证”，闹得人民连门也不能开。好容易等到抗战胜利了，人们都想这可该咱们自由了，谁知蒋阎来了，又继承了老日的“三证政策”，人们还是没有一点自由，而且统治得比老日还厉害，谁敢说一句公道话，就说你是“伪装分子”扣起来，叫你“坦白转生”。象这样不知苦害了多少人命！现在共产党来了，出入自由，走遍解放区都不要路条，民主政府不但取消了苛捐杂税，而且放粮贷款帮助我们，这真算是临汾人民第一次得到了自由。庆祝大会于下午三时正式开始，民主市府石市长和太岳二专署史专员均亲自到会致词，他们说：临汾战役的胜利，不仅全歼守敌二万五千多人，最主要的还是解放了临汾全市人民，学生再不会被匪军送到火线上当炮灰，商人再不会被迫饿着肚子去做工；从此大家新生的一天开始了。当他们讲到民主政府建设临汾各种政策时，全体市民的脸上都呈现出了笑容，报以热烈的掌声。石市长、史专员讲到最后时，都号召全市工、农、商、学、店员团结起来，为建设新的临汾而奋斗。最后，全体市民及临市中学以上学校向解放军献旗，一面是：“功在临汾”，一面是：“解民倒悬”。大会历三小时，始在欢笑愉快声中散会。（李泽民）
    【本报晋南前线二十九日电】在阎匪统治时期，临汾市中等学校的教员生活极端恶化，他们所得薪金，赶不上物价飞涨。如三月份薪金为蒋币四百万元，小麦每石就要六百万元；四月份薪金增至八九百万元，小麦每石就涨到一千余万元。薪金增一倍，物价涨两倍，在此情形下，教员除免强养活自己外，家庭无法维持。五月份，各校根本不发薪金，教员每天从三顿饭减节两顿饭，吃的是玉茭高粱粉，没有菜吃，饿得不行，但匪军还要抓去作工事。教员们描写他们恶劣的生活说：“人人称我老夫子，生活不如老妈子，同样给人看孩子（指教学生），吃不饱来饿不死。”又称当教员有“三不起”即“活不起、死不起（死了买不起棺材，用席卷）、病不起”。（维进）
