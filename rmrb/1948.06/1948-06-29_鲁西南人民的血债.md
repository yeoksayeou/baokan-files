　　The Blood Debt of the People of Southwestern Shandong
    Since the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek bandit Fifth Army, Qiu Qingquan's unit, sneaked into the southwestern Shandong area, they have been engaged in rampant rape, abuse, killing, conscription, and looting for the past three months. According to the local people, their inhuman crimes are such that "the suffering of the common people under the Fifth Army for three months is more than the suffering under the Japanese devils for eight years." The following is a record of this blood debt.
    (1) Rape. In the 21 villages of the sixth district of Yunbei County (newly established county, north of Yuncheng), almost all women between the ages of seventeen or eighteen and forty were raped by the bandit army. In Shizhuang, one battalion of enemy troops gang-raped nineteen women, not even sparing fifteen-year-old girls. In Fangzizhuang, two women committed suicide by jumping into a well to avoid being raped by the bandit army. In Renhuaizhuang in the first district of Yuncheng County and a certain village in the fifth district, women under the age of forty were all raped; the bandit soldiers even held women and flirted with them while on sentry duty. In Fenghuangdian, Juancheng County, after raping women, the bandit soldiers tied their hair together to prevent them from escaping. In Luji, three enemies raped a landlord's daughter in broad daylight on the street. In Mengxing District, Dingtao County, when two enemies raped a young woman, her parents tried to stop them, but the father was shot and killed, and the mother was stabbed. When the mother went to report to the battalion headquarters, the battalion commander scolded, "Can soldiers bring wives? Wherever the Kuomintang army goes, the women there are the Kuomintang army's wives." A woman in Zhangboshiji, ＠shan County (newly established county, west of Dongping Lake, formerly parts of Dongping, Dong'e, Shouzhang, and Yuncheng), firmly refused to be humiliated and was forced to jump out of a window and into a well, dying as a result. The enemy in Yuncheng captured 4,000 women and took away more than 2,000, whose fate remains unknown.
    (2) Conscription. In the first, fourth, and sixth districts of Yunbei County, the Fifth Army of Chiang Kai-shek bandits dragged away more than 10,000 young and middle-aged men. In the tenth district, two to three thousand people were also dragged away. Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Fifth Army went, they would separate men and women, old and young, under the pretext of holding meetings, taking the women away to rape them, and dragging away the young and middle-aged men. In Baliuzhuang and Sharang and five other villages in the eighth district of the county, more than 230 people were dragged away. After the young men of a certain village in Yuncheng were captured, only a blind man and a deaf-mute were left. The enemy often adopted the method of suddenly surrounding market fairs to capture young and middle-aged men who came to the market. Many of the captured young men jumped off the train to escape, but many were killed or injured in the fall.
    (3) Plunder. Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Fifth Army went, they robbed and plundered, demanding grain, grass, silver dollars, clothing, and shoes from the people, wanting everything except their own worthless Chiang Kai-shek currency. They robbed the people of their belongings from this village and sold them in that village, forcing the people to buy them. They had to buy them whether they wanted to or not, and they had to pay in silver dollars. If they didn't have silver dollars, they had to find a way to get them. The methods used by the bandit army to plunder were truly bizarre: the enemy in the fourth district of Yunbei County demanded ten "black-haired" cattle from the people, or even a cow with "one ear" would do. The people did not have such cattle, so they had to pay thirty-two silver dollars to settle the matter. When the bandit army went to another village, they demanded ten "three-wheeled carts." In Tonglaozhuang, Juye County, they demanded cattle with "three ears" and large carts pulled by four cattle, and even four was not enough, they wanted eight. The bandit army set many difficult problems for the people, the purpose of which was to extort money. In the end, they all demanded silver dollars to settle the matter. In many villages south of the Yellow River, chickens and pigs have almost disappeared. In Zhaolou, Yuju County (newly established county, under the jurisdiction of Yuncheng and Juye), the bandit army ate eighteen pigs, two hundred and seventy chickens, dragged away three cattle, two donkeys, and robbed 10,000 catties of grain in one night. In the nine districts of Yunbei County, a total of 662 cattle, 203 carts, 3,821 silver dollars, 65,000 pairs of shoes, and countless chickens, pigs, and grains were looted. The bandit army did not burn firewood, but specialized in splitting door panels, bed frames, and other wooden objects as firewood. As a result, not a single door panel was left on the north and south streets of Yuncheng County. Under the ravages of the bandit army, grass grew everywhere, and the place had become a dead city.
    (4) Massacre. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Fourth (covering eight counties including Shouyang) and Fifth (covering eleven counties including Cao County, Heze, Dingtao, and Dongming) sub-districts in southern Shandong killed more than 2,000 people in total. In Yuncheng County alone, more than 300 people were killed, more than 30 people were killed in the eighth district of Yunbei County, and 42 people were buried alive in the fifth district of Junan County (newly established county, south of Juye). The bandit army also imitated the methods of their fascist ancestor Hitler, requiring two villagers from each village in Lizhuang and other places in Yunbei County to serve as "hostages," requiring them to patrol the village and report by setting fire when the Liberation Army came, otherwise they would be killed. However, the people of southwestern Shandong did not bow to the beasts: after Zhao Houzhang of Zhaolou, Yuju County, was arrested, the enemy hung him upside down from a tree with his hands tied behind his back, placed a stool on his neck, pulled down hard, and whipped him with willow branches while pouring boiling oil on his head, forcing him to reveal the names of revolutionary cadres, but he did not say a word and remained unyielding until his death. Cao Jibiao's wife of Hanshiqiao was buried alive by the enemy, and she also did not reveal the names of the cadres until her death.
    When the Liberation Army returned to southwestern Shandong, the people of southwestern Shandong, who had suffered from the enemy's devastation, excitedly welcomed their own relatives—the People's Liberation Army, accusing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of their atrocities and demanding revenge for them. Once, when the Liberation Army was gathering to depart in a certain place, an eighty-two-year-old man stumbled to the front of the line and shouted, "Comrades, avenge us!" As he spoke, he knelt down, and the soldiers could not pull him up. He cried and told of the various crimes of the Fifth Army in southwestern Shandong; at the same time, the old man grabbed a child standing beside him and said, "Kneel down and ask the comrades to avenge your father who was buried alive by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits!" The district chief of the Mengxing District People's Government of Dingtao County said to the soldiers of the Liberation Army, "We have been waiting for you comrades day and night! The people all say: we would rather sacrifice on the battlefield than be forced to death by the Fifth Bandit Army. We guarantee to fully support our own troops to win the battle. The people have only one request for you comrades: eliminate the Fifth Army and avenge us!"

　　鲁西南人民的血债
    美械蒋匪整编第五军邱清泉部，自窜扰鲁西南地区后，三个月来，大肆奸淫、虐杀、抓丁、抢掠。其灭绝人性的罪行，据当地人民说：“整五军在这里三个月，咱老百姓受的苦比受日本鬼子八年的苦还多。”以下就是这笔血债的记录。
    （一）奸淫。郓北（新设县，在郓城北部）县六区二十一个庄子，从十七八岁到四十多岁的妇女，几乎全被匪军奸污过。史庄敌军一个营轮奸了十九个妇女，连十五岁的小闺女也未得免。房子庄二个妇女因拒绝匪军奸污至跳井自杀。郓城县一区任怀庄及五区某庄，四十岁以下的妇女均被奸污；甚至匪军在站岗时也抱着妇女调戏。鄄城县凤凰店匪军将妇女强奸后，还把他们的头发捆结在一起，以防止逃脱。在鲁集三个敌人白天在街上轮奸一个地主的闺女。定陶县孟型区两个敌人强奸一个闺女时，她父母曾前去拦阻，结果父被枪杀，母被戳了一刺刀。她母亲到营部去报告，营长骂道：“当兵的还能带老婆来吗？国军到那里那里的女人就是国军的老婆。”＠山（新设县。东平湖西、原东平、东阿、寿张、郓城各一部）县张博士集一妇女坚拒被辱，被迫跳窗投井而死。郓城之敌抓了四千妇女带走了两千多个，迄今生死不明。
    （二）抓丁。郓北县第一、第四、第六三个区，被整五军拉走的青壮年达一万人以上。第十区也被拉走了两三千人。蒋匪第五军每至一地，即借开会为名，把男女老少分开，女的带去强奸，男的青壮年拉走。该县第八区八留庄、沙壤等五个庄子被拉走了二百三十多人。郓城某村壮丁被抓后只剩了一个瞎子和一个哑子。敌人抓丁常采取突然包围集市的办法，捕捉赶集的青壮年，有不少被抓去的青壮年跳火车逃回来，但也有不少在跳车逃命时惨遭跌死和跌伤。
    （三）搜刮。蒋匪第五军每到一地即抢劫搜刮，向人民要粮、要草、要银元、要衣物、要鞋子，除了他们自己的那形同废纸的蒋币不要以外，其他无所不要。把老百姓的东西从这村抢来，到那村去变卖，强迫老百姓买，不买也得买，而且一定要银元，没有银元也得设法找来。匪军搜刮的方法真是千奇百怪：郓北县第四区之敌，向老百姓要十头“黑毛”牛，否则“一个耳朵”的牛也行，老百姓那有这样的牛，只好给三十二个银元了事。匪军到另外一个庄里又向人民要十辆“三轮大车”，到钜野县同老庄又要“三个耳朵”的牛，又要四头牛套的大车，四头还不行又要八头套的。匪军向老百姓出了许多难题，目的是为了勒索，结果都是要了银元才算了事。黄河以南许多村庄鸡子和猪几乎都绝迹了。郓钜县（新设县，辖郓城钜野各一部）赵楼一个庄上，匪军住了一晚，就吃掉了十八个猪，二百七十只鸡，拉走了三头牛，二头驴，抢去了一万斤粮食。郓北县九个区共抢去牛六六二头，大车二○三辆，银洋三八二一元，鞋子六五、○○○双，鸡、猪、粮食无数。匪军不烧柴草，专劈门板、床架等木器当柴火。郓城县南北大街因此没有剩下一扇门板。该地在匪军蹂躏下到处青草蔓生，已成一座死城。
    （四）屠杀。蒋匪鲁南第四（辖寿阳等八个县）第五（辖曹县、菏泽、定陶、东明等十一个县）两分区，共害死了两千多人。郓城一县被害死者即达三百多人，郓北县第八区被杀者三十多人，钜南（新设县，在钜野南部）县第五区被活埋了四十二个人。匪军并仿效其法西斯祖宗希特勒的办法，在郓北县李庄等地，每村要两个村民作“人质”，要他们在村上打更，解放军来了放火报告，否则就杀。但是鲁西南的人民并没有向野兽们低头：郓钜县赵楼赵候章被捕后，敌人把他两手反吊在树上，颈上架以板凳，用力向下拉，一面用柳条抽打，向头上浇滚油，逼他说出革命干部的姓名，但他只字不吐，至死不屈。韩石桥曹继标之妻被敌活埋，同样至死没有说出干部姓名。
    当解放大军重来鲁西南后，受尽敌人摧残的鲁西南人民，激动而兴奋的欢迎自己的亲人——人民解放军，向解放军控诉蒋匪的兽行，要求替他们报仇，一次当解放军在某地集合出发时，一位年已八十二岁的老人，一颠一蹶的走到队伍前面喊道：“同志，替咱报仇呀！”边说就边跪下去，战士们拉也拉不起来，他哭诉整五军在鲁西南的种种罪行；这老人同时又把站在他身边的一个小孩拉住说：“快跪下来，要求同志替你那被蒋匪活埋的爹报仇呀！”定陶县孟型区民主政府区长对解放军战士们说：“这里白日黑夜的盼望着同志们来呀！老百姓都说：咱宁愿在阵前牺牲，也不甘心叫匪五军逼死。咱们保证全力支援自己部队打胜仗。老百姓对同志们只有一个要求：消灭整五军，替咱报仇！”【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十七日电】
