Shexian Farm Cadres Go to the Countryside to Organize the Masses to Select Wheat Seeds

[Shexian News] In the second district of Shexian, wheat in the upper half of the district from Shimen is generally affected by black mold, especially in Shimen and Haojia Second Village, which are the most serious. In Shimen Village, out of 1,050 mu of wheat, 370 mu are affected by black mold. On average, four or five out of every ten ears are diseased. Two households in Haojia have already plowed up this wheat, and the masses are discussing it. According to research at the district production director's meeting, this disease was only discovered in a few ears the year before last, then two or three ears last year, and this year it accounts for half. Although the situation is not so serious in other villages, a considerable amount has also been discovered, which is definitely a result of wheat seed transmission. The production director of Jinjiahui obtained wheat seeds from Gengle Village in the fourth district that were not diseased and grew very well. When the masses were building roads in the fourth district, they also took a liking to the bald wheat (ban jia ta) and requested to exchange wheat seeds. Based on this request from the masses, the county jointly studied the matter with the Cooperation Section of the Farm on June 3rd and decided to fully organize the masses to select and regulate seeds and plant local high-quality wheat seeds. On the one hand, the masses are being mobilized to replace all diseased wheat to prevent further losses next year. On the other hand, people are being sent to the fourth and sixth districts to organize the masses to select good seeds and harvest and store them separately. The fourth district has completed 258 shi (large dou), and the sixth district has completed 121 shi, which is enough to plant 20,000 mu of land. The exchange method is that the seeds selected by the seed-selecting village are harvested and stored separately, and the amount is counted as the village's public grain (other public grain to be paid is compensated to these households to prevent seed mixing). The masses who use seeds from other villages use their own wheat to make up the public grain (good wheat) and exchange it at the seed-storing village. To encourage the enthusiasm of the seed-storing village (because storing seeds involves extra work), one jin is added for every ten jin exchanged (i.e., exchanging ten jin is equivalent to eleven jin of public grain). The masses are also very satisfied. Currently, farm cadres have been dispatched to the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh districts to focus on this work.

　　涉县农场干部下乡
  　组织群众选麦种
    【涉县消息】涉县二区从石门往上半个区麦子普遍发黑霉病，尤其石门，郝家二村最严重，石门全村一千零五十亩麦子，黑霉病就有三百七十余亩，每十穗里平均四五穗病的。郝家有两户已把这麦子犁了，群众议论纷纷，据全区生产主任会议上研究，这病前年才发现有不几穗，去年有二三穗，今年就占了一半，其余村虽没这样严重，也发现不少了，确系麦种的传染，靳家会生产主任从四区更乐村换的麦种没有生病，而且长的很好，群众在四区修路，也看中了秃麦（半架塔）都要求换麦种。县里根据群众这个要求，于六月三日由合作科农场共同研究，全力要组织群众选种与调剂，种本地的优良麦种。一方面发动群众要把所有病麦全部改换，以防下年再受损失，一面到四区、六区组织群众选择优种及分别收割保存，四区完成二百五十八石（大斗），现六区完成一百廿一石，已够二万亩地种。兑换办法是选种村选出的种，分别收割保存，数目作为该村的公粮（其他应出之公粮补给这一户怕种子杂了）。用种树子群众换多少把自己的麦子补成公粮（好麦子），到存麦种村兑换，为鼓励存种村的情绪（因种子多误工），换种每十斤加一斤（即兑十斤顶十一斤的公粮）群众亦很满意。现农场干部已分别到二、四、六、七区突击这一工作。
