　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd—A portion of the People's Liberation Army's Northern Jiangsu Corps suddenly appeared on the outskirts of Xuzhou (Donghai), a strategic stronghold of the Kuomintang army in northern Jiangsu on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. After a week of fighting, they completely cleared out the peripheral strongholds of Haizhou and Xinpu to its southeast, cutting off railway and telecommunications traffic between Xuzhou and Haizhou, and eliminating over 2,000 Kuomintang troops from the reorganized 44th Division, 83rd Division, and local bandits. The battle began on the night of the 8th. Our army first ambushed the Kuomintang bandits of the reorganized 44th Division and reorganized 83rd Division in areas such as Ahu, Chengtou, Xuebu, and Fangshan (all between Haizhou and Xin'anzhen) along the Longhai Railway west of Haizhou, killing and wounding over 600 of them, and immediately contained Banshandong Station on the Longhai Railway north of Xuebu. On the 14th, we captured the strongholds of Diaoli Tuan and Xiaodongguan (20 li north of Xinpu) on the outskirts of Haizhou Xinpu, annihilating two local security squadrons. On the 14th, we also captured Dunshang Town, an important stronghold more than 30 li northwest of Haizhou, completely annihilating the 3rd Battalion of the 484th Regiment of the reorganized 44th Division, the Ganyu County Government, three security squadrons, a "self-defense" brigade, and the district office, totaling more than 1,400 enemy troops. Among them, over 400 were killed or wounded under the command of enemy battalion commander Lai Dehua and brigade commander Feng Jialin, and over 1,000 enemy personnel were captured, including Wang Shenzhi, the chief secretary of the county government and captain of the Gannan police. Seized were a total of six mortars and 60mm guns, 45 light and heavy machine guns, 14 submachine guns, 626 rifles, two radio stations, and four telephones. At the same time, a part of our army advanced near the Xinpu Airport, and the planes on the field took off and left overnight. The various units burned down the enemy fortifications on Tashan, within 40 li west of Haizhou. By this time, Haizhou, an important strategic city on the Yellow Sea coast on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, had been isolated, and the Kuomintang army in Haizhou was in extreme panic.
