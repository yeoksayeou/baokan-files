　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Washington dispatch: The second session of the Eightieth Congress of the United States, which opened in early January, adjourned on the 20th of this month. The reactionary factions of both the Republican and Democratic parties passed a series of reactionary bills in this Congress aimed at external aggression, further oppression of the people at home, and military expansion. Important ones include: (1) The $6,003,071,000 "compromise foreign aid appropriation bill" of both houses (including $4 billion for the Marshall Plan and $400 million for the aid-Chiang plan). This final appropriation was reduced by $500.3 million compared to what Congress had previously passed, but the fifteen-month payment period (the payment period finally approved by Congress) stipulates that it can be used up within twelve months upon the recommendation of the President and the executors of the "Economic Cooperation Administration" (i.e., the general supervisory body for the foreign aid plan). (2) The peacetime conscription law. It stipulates the conscription of men aged nineteen to twenty-five for twenty-one months of military service. This conscription law, which violates the UN General Assembly's resolution on universal disarmament, "finally approves the number of U.S. armed forces to 2 million" (U.S. Information Service, 19th), thus increasing by about double compared to last year's "approved strength of 1.07 million," and more than tenfold compared to the pre-war strength of 174,000. (3) A massive military budget. In the $34.89 billion next year's budget finally passed by Congress, in addition to the above-mentioned $6 billion "aid" foreign appropriation for external expansion, the total defense expenditure is about $14 billion.
    The fascist Mundt anti-communist bill, which was originally planned to be passed in this Congress, was passed by the House of Representatives on May 19, but due to the protests, demonstrations, and evidentiary opposition of the American people, the bill was ultimately shelved in the Senate and not passed. Another "military fascist measure" (Wallace's words), namely the so-called "universal military training law," which Truman submitted to Congress as early as last year and repeatedly called for its rapid passage, was once again shelved this time due to the strong opposition of the American people, and "neither house brought it up for discussion" (U.S. Information Service, 21st).

　　美第八十届国会
  　通过许多反动法案
  　“蒙特法案”因人民反对被搁置
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】华盛顿消息：一月初开幕的美国第八十届国会的第二次会议，已于本月二十日闭幕。共和民主两党反动派在这届国会中通过了一系列对外侵略对内进一步压迫人民及扩军的反动法案。重要者计有：（一）六十亿零三千零七十一万元的两院“折衷援外拨款案”（包括马歇尔计划四十亿元及援蒋计划四亿元）。此项最后通过的拨款，较国会前已通过者削减了五亿零三百万元，但其十五个月的支付时间（国会最后所通过的支付时间），则规定在总统及“经济合作局”（按即援外计划之总监督机关）执行人的建议下，得在十二个月内用完。（二）和平时期的征兵法。其中规定征召十九岁至二十五岁的男子服兵役二十一个月。此一违反联大普遍裁军决议的征兵法，“最后核准美国武装大队人数至二百万人”（美新闻处十九日电），因而较去年“核准兵力一百零七万人”增加约一倍，较战前兵力十七万四千人增加了十倍以上。（三）庞大的军事预算，在国会最后通过的三百四十八亿九千万元下年度预算中，除上述为了向外扩张的六十亿“援”外拨款外，全部国防费用约达一百四十亿元左右。
    原拟在这届国会中通过的法西斯化的蒙特反共法案，虽经众院于五月十九日通过，但在美国人民的抗议，示威与举证反对之下，该案卒被搁置于参院之中而未获通过。杜鲁门早于去年提交国会并屡次呼吁予以迅速通过的另一“军事法西斯措施”（华莱士语），即所谓“普遍军训法”，此次亦因遭受美国人民的强烈反对而再度被搁置，参众两院“均未将其提付讨论”（美新闻处二十一日电）。
