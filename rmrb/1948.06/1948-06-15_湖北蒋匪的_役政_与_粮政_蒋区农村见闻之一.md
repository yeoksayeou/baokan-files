　　Hubei Chiang Bandit's "Conscription Administration" and "Grain Administration"
    ——Rural Sights in the Chiang Area, Part 1
    Wang Kuang
    Last November, when I, as a reporter, advanced with the People's Liberation Army's offensive into the Jianghan area, I saw two folk songs at the home of a schoolteacher: one describing the desolate scene after the Chiang bandits conscripted men in the countryside, and the other expressing the people's resentment towards the Chiang bandits' grain requisition. The original lyrics are as follows:
    "Black sesame, blooms white flowers, the young wife, returns to her mother's home. Saw her father, saw her mother, her father-in-law and mother-in-law, asked her, is our family, doing well? Alas, alas, it's hopeless, your brother, is not at home, eating no grain, wearing no flowers. Speaking so, tears streamed down. My daughter, how are you? Your guest (meaning son-in-law) has been taken away! Alas, alas, my mother."
    "Old lady Gao, loves playing with guns, opens the door, slams the bolt, shuts her mouth tight, aims carefully, carelessly a bang rings out, hitting the grain-collecting monkey head of the Bao. This causes trouble, but she is brave and not flustered, dragging the rifle (机尾 refers to rifle) to the back hill. Damn him, screw his mother, who told him to come secretly to collect grain."
    There is a reason for the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to sing these two folk songs.
    The people in the Chiang-controlled areas call the Chiang bandits' "conscription administration" a "plague." (Since the Chiang bandits implemented the counter-revolutionary general mobilization last July, the terror of conscripting soldiers has been spreading in the countryside like a plague.) Initially, it was the divisions and regiment districts that were grabbing people, then the provincial security teams, the militia self-defense forces, and the township Bao offices. Wherever the bandit regular army went, it was a frenzy of grabbing men. In the Sui County and Zaoyang area alone, the regiment district conscription office grabbed men two or three times from last July to November. According to the confessions of Chiang bandits from Zhongxiang's Sui County and documents from the county "Council," Sui County had to grab 4,000 men and Zhongxiang 3,000 by the end of last year. Some counties considered to have a history of "reddening," such as Huang'an, Jingfu, Qianjiang, and Mianyang, used the vicious method of "immigration," wanting to take away all the young men and leaving the land and villages completely deserted.
    The methods of drafting and grabbing men varied in each county. At the beginning, it was generally the so-called "one out of two," and later it was "father and son must be soldiers," grabbing everyone. Even if the son was drafted, the father, if under forty, still had to go. Even brothers who had separated their families were both grabbed to be soldiers. Some places used various novel tricks, such as using deceptive means like "holding meetings," "voting for pseudo-National Assembly representatives," and "checking household registrations" in the rural areas near Wuhan, concentrating the young men together, and then escorting them away with guns. The people south of the Xiang River call drafting soldiers "becoming a company commander," because after being grabbed, they were tied "in companies" with ropes, then locked up and starved for three or two days, before being loaded onto cars, trains, or ships and sent far away. Last November, more than 7,000 Hubei conscripts collectively jumped off vehicles and trains in the dark while being transferred from Nanjing to Shanghai, with countless people falling to their deaths or getting injured. Only a very few escaped back to their hometowns. The families of the conscripted men were free to be occupied by local despots and township Bao personnel. When I liberated Zhongxiang City, I met an old man named Liu Shilian, who had been starved for five days after being grabbed by the Chiang bandits. He said that on the very night he was grabbed, his wife was forcibly taken as a concubine by the local tyrant Yan Xinren.
    Conscription went hand in hand with grain requisition, and the two were the Chiang bandits' two major bloodsuckers in the countryside. According to Zhang, the head of the eighth Jia of the third Bao of Wujiadian, Zaoyang, the grain he handed over to the Chiang bandits in November and December of last year included five *shi* of "military grain" and "militia grain," five *shi* of "self-defense grain," and fifteen *shi* of grain collected by the township office, as well as thirty-five *dou* of "comfort rice." The extortion in just two months accounted for one-fifth of the entire Jia's annual harvest, and the large amounts of "grain purchases" and "allocations" were not even included. It should be pointed out that the Wujiadian area is a grain-deficient area, and other grain-producing areas are even more heavily exploited.
    The Chiang bandit "Field Grain Purchase Office" demanded that farmers hand over "the very best" grain. Some grain requisition offices had a specially constructed large windmill. After the grain passed through the windmill, usually one *dou* would only leave eight *sheng*. If the grain officials were unhappy, one *dou* would only leave five *sheng* after passing through the windmill. The people who delivered the grain were forced to supplement the so-called: "Purchasing military grain" with tears in their eyes, which was actually robbing grain. For example, the grain purchased last June was only paid for at the June grain price in December, while the grain price had already increased eightfold in the six months before and after. Many grain stores and rice shops in large and small market towns were bankrupted in this way. Ordinary farmers complained that the Chiang bandits even robbed them of their seed grain.
    Under the double whammy of Chiang bandits conscripting soldiers and requisitioning grain, the Xiang River's banks, which were originally a fertile rice and wheat producing area, had hundreds and thousands of acres of land laid to waste. What impressed me most was the area around Zhongxiang, Jiangling, and Qianjiang. Two years ago, when the New Fourth Army was here, many rural areas were still covered with green rice seedlings, but now they are wastelands overgrown with reeds and grass. In January of this year, the Chiang bandits planned to plunder the grain of several reorganized divisions on both sides of the Xiang River in one go. If the People's Liberation Army had not advanced into Jianghan in time, hundreds of thousands more people would have been plunged into starvation.

### 湖北蒋匪的“役政”与“粮政”——蒋区农村见闻之一

　　湖北蒋匪的“役政”与“粮政”
    ——蒋区农村见闻之一
    王匡
    记者去年十一月随人民解放军进攻大军挺进至江汉地区时，在一位教书先生家里看到两首民谣：一首是描写蒋匪在农村中抓丁后的凄凉景象；另一首是表现人民对蒋匪征粮的愤恨。原词如下：
    “黑芝麻，开白花，小媳妇，走娘家。见了父，见了妈，公和婆，问我啦，咱家里，可好吧？唉呀呀，真没法，你的哥，没在家，吃无粮，穿无花。说着话，泪巴巴。我的女你怎样？你的客（即女婿）拉走啦！唉唉呀，我的妈呀。”
    “高老娅，好玩枪，拉开门，摒上膛，闩嘴好，细端详，不小心镗一响，一打打着征粮的猴保长。这一下把祸闯，算有种不心慌，拖着机尾（机尾指枪）往后岗。日他妈，操他娘，谁叫他偷着来征粮。”
    蒋区老百姓唱出这两首民谣，不是没有来由的。
    蒋区老百姓把蒋匪的“役政”叫做“疫症”。（自去年七月蒋匪实行反革命的总动员以后，抓壮丁的恐怖就象瘟疫一样的在农村中流行起来。）起初是师、团管区抓，后来是省保安队抓，民团自卫队抓，乡保公所抓，匪正规军所到之处，更是疯狂的大抓而特抓，在随县、枣阳一带只团管区一个抓丁机关，去年七月到十一月就抓了两三次，根据俘虏的钟祥之随县蒋匪的口供和县“参议会”的文件显示，随县在去年年底要抓丁四千、钟祥三千，而有些被视为有“赤化”历史的县份如黄安、经扶、潜江、沔阳等县，则使用毒辣的“移民”手段，要将全部壮丁集中带走，让土地和村庄全部荒废。
    抽、抓壮丁的方式各县份里开头普遍是所谓“二抽一”，后来是“父子要当兵”一把抓，即使儿子被抽走，父亲不满四十岁的还得去，就是分了家的弟兄二人也都要被抓去当兵。有些地方用了各种新奇花样，如在武汉附近农村里是用“开会”、“投伪国大代表票”、“清查户口”等欺骗手段，将壮丁集中在一起后，就用枪杆押走。襄河以南的老百姓叫抓丁做“当连长”，因被抓以后，即用绳索捆“连”起来，然后关着饿三两天，再装上汽车、火车或船舶送到远方。去年十一月间，湖北壮丁七千多名，在由南京转送上海途中，即在黑夜集体跳车逃跑，跌死跌伤的不计其数，只有很少的几个逃回故乡。被抓走后的壮丁家属，恶霸地主和乡保人员可以随便霸占，记者在解放钟祥城时，遇到一个被蒋匪抓来饿了五天的老乡刘世练，他说就在他被抓走后的当天晚上，他的女人即被恶霸严信仁强占去当小老婆。
    与抓丁同时进行的是征粮，两者是蒋匪在农村中的两只大吸血鬼，据枣阳吴家店第三保八甲张甲长说，在去年十一、十二两个月内，经他手交与蒋匪的粮食计有“军粮”、“民兵粮食”黄谷五石，“自卫粮”黄谷五石，乡公所还收粮食黄谷十五石，“慰劳米”三十五斗，仅仅两个月的勒索即占该甲全年全部收成的五分之一，而大量的“购粮”、“派款”等还未计算在内，要指出的是吴家店一带还是一个缺粮区，其他产粮区还要搜刮得更厉害。
    蒋匪“田粮征购处”收粮，要农民交“顶好的”，有些征粮机关备有一个特别构造的大风车，粮食经过风车后，通常一斗就只剩八升，如果粮官们不高兴，一斗过风后就只余下五升，送粮的人被迫含着泪补交所谓：“购买军粮”，实际上就是抢粮，例如去年六月购的粮，到十二月才按六月粮价给钱，而前后半年间粮价已经涨了八倍，很多大小集镇的粮行米店，都是这样被“购”得破产了。一般农民都控诉蒋匪连他们的谷种都抢光了。
    在蒋匪抓丁征粮双管齐下的吮吸下，使原是一块丰饶米麦产区的襄河两岸，成千成百亩的土地尽成荒芜。记者印象最深的是钟祥和江陵、潜江一带，这里很多农村在前两年新四军在时，还是一片绿油油的禾苗，如今是长满芦苇丛草的荒原了。今年一月间蒋匪曾计划在襄河南北两岸一次要劫夺几个整编师的粮食，如果不是人民解放军及时挺进江汉，又要有数百万人陷于饥饿了。
