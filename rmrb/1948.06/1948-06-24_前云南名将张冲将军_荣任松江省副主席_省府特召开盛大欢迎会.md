Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: Former renowned Yunnan military leader General Zhang Chong has recently been appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government by the Northeast Administrative Committee. On the 14th of this month, the Songjiang Provincial Government held a grand welcome reception to celebrate Vice Chairman Zhang's assumption of office. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, along with committee members Che Xiangchen, Xu Shou Xuan, Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, Zhang Xiushan of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhu Qiwen, Mayor of Harbin Special Municipality, all attended and offered their congratulations.

At the meeting, Chairman Feng Zhongyun of Songjiang Province delivered a speech, praising Vice Chairman Zhang's determination to serve the people and welcoming Vice Chairman Zhang to participate in leading the work of Songjiang Province on behalf of the province's more than 2.8 million people. Subsequently, Vice Chairman Zhang rose amidst warm applause and said, "My participation in the work of Songjiang Province this time is the beginning of my learning about the work of the New Democratic regime. Being able to actually participate in the work of the liberated areas is the greatest joy of my life."

Vice Chairman Zhang recalled that in the past, when he was in the KMT-controlled areas, he suffered various discriminations and blows from the reactionaries and was pessimistic due to the darkness of the KMT areas, which affected his health. When Vice Chairman Zhang spoke about the situation after arriving in the liberated areas, he said cheerfully, "Now I have become younger, and my weight has increased by thirty pounds." He also stated that he is willing to devote himself to the New Democratic cause in the future, serve the people to the end, and be a student of the masses.

Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin and Comrade Zhang Xiushan also gave congratulatory speeches one after another, unanimously praising Vice Chairman Zhang's spirit of daring to pursue truth and light, which is worthy of everyone's learning. After the meeting, a banquet was held at Xinhua Building in Harbin, and an entertainment evening was held in the evening.

It is reported that Vice Chairman Zhang Chong is from Luxi County, Yunnan Province, and is currently 49 years old. He joined the army in the early years of the Republic of China and served as battalion commander, regimental commander, and detachment leader in the Yunnan Army. During the Great Revolution, he served as the commander of the 101st Division of the National Revolutionary Army. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he served as the commander of the 184th Division of the 60th Army of the Yunnan Army, Deputy Commander and Acting Commander of the 60th Army, Commander of the New Third Army, and Commander of the Second Route of the First Front Army. In addition to his military positions, he also served as Yunnan Provincial Salt Transport Envoy and Engineering Supervisor.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Vice Chairman Zhang advocated that all parties and factions in the country should unite against Japan, which displeased Chiang Kai-shek, resulting in frequent surveillance by secret agents. In February of last year, he and his wife and children took the opportunity to escape from the KMT-controlled areas under the pretext of attending the bogus National Congress and arrived in Yan'an. Subsequently, he transferred to the Northeast Liberated Area and served as a senior advisor to the Northeast People's Liberation Army. He was recently appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government by the Northeast Administrative Committee.
