　　Gaoyi Third District, Yangcheng Pingtou Rectify Mutual Aid
　　Determination to Break Formalism
　　Correct Coercive and Unfair Phenomena
    [Taiyue News] Pingtou Village, Yangcheng First District, recently inspected and rectified mutual aid groups. The whole village has a total of 217 households. In name, only 13 households did not participate in mutual aid, but in reality, except for the group of Wang Haizhou, Zhao Xiaosan, and Zhang Fashi which was relatively good, the rest were empty shells, existing only in name. Two problems hinder the consolidation and development of mutual aid groups: (1) Forced formation, extremely undemocratic - last year, mutual aid groups were formed by household, and at that time, all members put their fingerprints on agreements stipulating that they could not withdraw from the group casually, "the collapse of the group will be the responsibility of the whole people," which created an extremely undemocratic phenomenon in the group. Chang Xiaohuang's family had financial difficulties and asked his younger brother, Jiafu, to graze cattle in another village. The group leader, Chang Xiaolai, said, "Not allowed to leave the group." Later, Jiafu went, and his whole family was expelled from the group. Some groups were so undemocratic that everyone quarreled and broke up. Li Chixian, as the group leader, forced the members to obey him. The members couldn't stand it. This time during the wheat harvest, they worked separately, and the group collapsed. (2) Unreasonable system, unfair work point recording - the regulations stipulated that wages did not distinguish between strong and weak, skilled and unskilled, and there was no equivalent exchange. Yang Gengtu's group proposed: "Regardless of how much wheat anyone has, regardless of how strong or weak anyone's labor is, this group of people will finish this task and that's it." Zheng Baozhen's group assigned Wang Fuqing and Haiqing to water the garden. One was an expert, and the other was a novice, but they were recorded the same work points. The two could not get along no matter what, and they just dragged through the day's work, with no one being motivated, causing the mutual aid group to gradually collapse. After inspection, the village cadres realized that the above two major problems were the fatal injuries of the mutual aid groups. If they are not rectified now, production will be greatly affected. Now they are relying on regular mutual aid and the better-performing groups to educate everyone, correct past problems, and be sure to reorganize the mutual aid groups on a voluntary and equivalent basis.

　　高邑三区、阳城坪头整顿互助
  　决心打破形式主义
  　纠正强迫不公现象
    【太岳讯】阳城一区坪头村，最近检查整顿互助组。全村共二百一十七户，在名义上只有十三户没有参加互助，实际上除了王海洲、赵小三、张法示的那组比较好，其余都是空架子，有名无实。两个问题障碍使互助组的巩固与发展：（一）强迫编制，极不民主——去年互助组是按户整编而成，当时组员都按了手印，规定不能随便退组，“组垮要负责全民，这就造成了组里的极端不民主现象，常小慌家里生活困难，叫他弟弟家富去外村放牛，组长常小来说：“不准出组”，后来家富去了，他一家全被从组里开除。有些组因为太不民主，大家吵上一顿就散了伙。李池先当组长，逼着组员都要服从他，组员们受不了，这次割麦子就各干各的，互相垮了。（二）制度不合理，记工不公——规定工资不分强弱，不分巧拙，没有等价交换。杨庚土组提出：“不管谁的麦子多少，不管谁的劳力强弱，这伙人这伙事，将麦割完就完事。”郑保珍组分配王福庆和海青两人浇园，一是行家，一是劣把，却是一样记工，两人无论怎样也合不来，每日工作熬日头，谁也不起劲，使得互助组渐渐垮台了。经过检查以后，村干认识了以上两大毛病是互助组的致命伤，现在再不搞好，生产就要受大影响了。现在他们正在依靠经常互助，作得较好的小组，向大家进行教育，改正过去的毛病，一定在自愿等价的基础上，重新把互助组整顿起来。
