Letter from the Lin County Government:
	Regarding the Issue of the Xietai and Yucheng Coal Mines - Currently Seeking Those Involved for Investigation and Handling
	Editor:
	We have seen the question raised by Youren in the People's Daily regarding the Xietai and Yucheng coal mines operated by our Lin County government (see this newspaper, May 28th). Because our current cadres do not understand the situation, and the cadres who handled it in the past have been transferred, please notify Youren to come to the county government to discuss a solution. We are also sending people to find Comrade Fang Yuan, the former head of the Construction Section who handled the matter, to inquire about the situation so that we can quickly and correctly resolve it. (Lin County Government)

　　林县县政府来信：
    关于协泰玉成两煤矿问题  正找经手人调查处理 
   编辑同志：
    人民日报登载幽人提问的我林县政府经营之协泰玉成两煤矿问题（见本报五月二十八日），我们看到了，由于我们现在的干部都不了解，过去经手的干部都调走了，请你们通知幽人来到县府商谈解决，我们也派人去找过去经手的建设科长方圆同志，访问情况，以便能迅速正确的解决。（林县县政府）
