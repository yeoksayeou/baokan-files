    Joint Directive on Wheat Collection in Central Hebei and Northern Yue Area Issued
  　Rewarding Intensive Cultivation, Increasing Production Without Increasing Burdens
    [Our Newspaper] On May 31, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued a directive on wheat collection work. The main points are as follows: (1) Grasp the spirit of "military needs take precedence over civilian needs," implement the principle of providing wheat if wheat is available, and providing cloth if cloth is available. Correct the practice of buying wheat to submit if no wheat is grown, and buying cloth to submit if no cloth is woven. Except for Northeastern Shanxi and Northern Yan, where a portion of currency is collected, all other areas will only collect wheat and cloth. Goods borrowed in advance will be deducted from public grain in the autumn. (2) Collect wheat based on acreage, without any progressive rates, in order to encourage intensive cultivation. Collection is not based on actual output, but rather on 18% of the average annual wheat yield of the wheat field. Military, government, and martyrs' families and the widowed and orphaned who lack labor (households with one laborer are not eligible for exemption) may be assessed slightly less than 18%, based on the specific circumstances of each household. However, the lowest rate should not be less than 12%. Farmers with more wheat fields and a better standard of living will not be assessed more, in order to encourage production. The conversion rate for wheat should generally be one jin of wheat equals one jin of rice, based on the customary relationship between rice and wheat prices. In Northeastern Shanxi, Northern Yan, and Western Hebei, where wheat prices are high and rice prices are low, an appropriate conversion rate can be determined based on the difference between rice and wheat prices after the wheat harvest. (3) Various localities should refer to the wealth distribution of past unified progressive taxes to collect cloth. Cloth collection stations should be set up at the collection points to allow the masses to hand in cloth as they weave it. The price of the cloth collected should not exceed the price of a bolt of cloth for a斗of rice. When collecting cloth, the equivalent in millet should be calculated according to the current local market price, based on the different times, locations, and quality of the cloth. (4) Regarding the leadership of the wheat collection work, the directive emphasized that the central link is to understand the quantity and quality of wheat fields over the years. After preliminary investigation, quotas should be allocated to the village level, and then, after reaching the village level, the specific allocation to households should be carried out through a combination of investigation and self-reporting with public discussion. The purpose of public discussion is to ensure that the collection is appropriate to the specific conditions of each locality. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of wealthy individuals to conceal production and poor and hired peasants to shift the burden onto middle peasants, so as to increase the burden on those above the middle peasant level, and ensure that the burden is fair and reasonable. Finally, it is pointed out that this directive is fully applicable to the rural areas of Central Hebei, Northern Yue, and Shijiazhuang, and can be used as a reference for Taihang, Taiyue, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Southern Hebei.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府
    晋察冀行政委员会
    联合颁发
    冀中北岳麦征工作指示
  　奖励精耕细作·增产不增负担
    【本报讯】五月三十一日，晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会，联合发出关于麦征工作指示。要点如下：（一）掌握军需民有精神，实行有麦出麦，有布出布，改正不种麦子的买上麦子交麦、不织布的买上布交布办法。除晋东北、雁北征收一部分货币外，其他地区一律只征麦与布。预借性之货物，秋后抵顶公粮。（二）按亩征麦，一律不累进，一本奖励精耕细作精神，不按实际产量，而是根据麦田常年产麦量，征收其麦产百分之十八。缺乏劳动力之军、干、烈属及孤寡，（家中有一个劳动力者不能援例）得按各户具体情况，稍低于百分之十八。但至低不能少于百分之十二。麦田多生活富裕之农民，不另多征，以奖励生产。征麦折合率，根据米麦相随习惯，一般确定一斤麦折合一斤米。晋东北、雁北及平西，麦价高，米价低，可依据麦收后米麦价格之差额，规定适当之折合率。（三）各地参照过去统累税之富力分配，进行征布。于征布地点，设收布站，使群众随织随交。所收之布，不得超过斗米匹布价格，收布时，须根据不同之时间地点，及不同质量之布匹，按照当时当地市价，折合小米。（四）关于麦征工作领导问题，该指示着重指出：其中心环节，在于了解麦田常年之数量与质量，经过初步调查，逐级分配到村，到村后，采取调查与自报公议相结合的办法，具体分配到户。公议之目的，在于使征收适合各地具体情况。因此，必须预防富裕者隐瞒产量，及贫雇农把负担挤到中农身上以加重中农以上成份负担的偏向，务使负担做到公平合理。最后指出：这一指示完全适用于冀中、北岳与石家庄农村区，太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南可参照办理。
