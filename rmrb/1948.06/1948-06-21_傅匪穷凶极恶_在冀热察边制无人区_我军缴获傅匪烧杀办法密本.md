　　Fu Bandit's Extreme Ferocity
　　Creating a No-Man's Land in the Border Area of Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar
　　Our Army Captures Fu Bandit's Secret Book of Burning and Killing Methods
　　[Frontline of Ping-Sui, 16th Dispatch] Recently, our army captured a top-secret document personally issued by the Fu bandit, the so-called "Implementation Methods for Destroying Mountain Bandit (referring to our Liberation Army) Base Areas," on the Ping-Sui Front. This culprit has fully inherited the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy," making explicit provisions for killing and arson against the people in the Liberated Areas. The document states that in order to "achieve the most thorough destruction and seize the most materials in the shortest possible time, all counties near the bandit areas (the Jiang-Fu bandits' derogatory term for the Liberated Areas) should establish 'Anti-Bandit and Rescue the People Plundering Teams.'" It also stipulates that buildings "should be leveled or burned, solid walls pushed down and demolished, and their foundations leveled." Regarding the people in the Liberated Areas, it stipulates: "Once captured, they should be executed." These bloody regulations expose the Fu Zuoyi bandit's ferocious and wicked face. The facts are also like this. In the border areas of western Ping, northern Ping, Hebei-Chahar-Rehe, and eastern Hebei, one can see villages that have been devastated by the Fu bandits, people's property looted, and people surviving by eating tree leaves and wild vegetables. The "No-Man's Land" is even more tragic. Take the newly liberated Hushiha Village in Luanping, Rehe, for example. The village originally had more than 240 households, but after the Fu bandits' massacre and encirclement, only more than 40 households remain, and nine out of ten houses are empty, with weeds growing where the doors used to be, and the fields are barren everywhere. The "New Policy" that the Fu bandit has repeatedly promoted to Jiang Thief is this kind of inhumane atrocity.

　　傅匪穷凶极恶
  　在冀热察边制无人区
  　我军缴获傅匪烧杀办法密本
    【平绥前线十六日电】新近我军在平绥前线缴到一本傅匪亲手颁布的所谓“捣毁山地匪军（指我解放军）根据地实施办法”的极机密文件，这个罪魁全盘继承了日寇的三光政策，向解放区人民做出杀人放火的明文规定。文件上说，为了“能在最短期间破坏最为彻底，抢运最多物资，凡接近匪区（蒋傅匪诬蔑解放区的称呼）之各县，均应组设剿匪救民抢运队”。并规定对房屋建筑“应予平毁或焚毁，坚固墙壁推倒拆毁，并铲平其根基”。对解放区人民，规定：“一经捕获，就予处决”。这种种充满血腥的规定，把傅作义匪徒一副穷凶极恶的凶相暴露无遗。事实也是如此，在平西平北冀察热河及冀东等地的边沿地带，到处可以见到被傅匪烧得残破不堪的村庄，人民财物被抢一空，靠着吃树叶野菜度日。“无人区”就更惨，拿热河滦平新解放的虎什哈村为例，全村原有二百四十几户，经傅匪屠杀、圈走，现只剩下四十几户，而且十室九空，蒿草长的没了门户，四野都是荒地。傅匪曾多次向蒋贼献功推行的“新政”，就是这种灭绝人性的暴行。
