　　Protecting Wheat Harvest Reports Victory from North and South
  　An East Anyang Battle Shatters Bandit Dreams
  　Eight Days in Tianjin-Baoding Eliminate 600 Enemies
    [Anyang News] On June 10th, the main force of the 40th Division of the Chiang bandits in Anyang, the entire 117th Regiment, and more than 3,000 troops of the puppet Wang Qingning, Si Bingnan, and others, went out in two routes to rob the areas of Lizhuang and Conggu, and attempted to set up temporary wheat-grabbing outposts. Our "Victory Troops," in order to protect the wheat for the people, actively engaged the enemy. After fierce fighting, the enemy in Guanzhuang and other places could not withstand the attack and fled back. Our army then surrounded the main force of the enemy's 117th Regiment in the Conggu area. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy abandoned more than 30 corpses at dusk and fled in panic to Anyang. In this battle, we eliminated more than 200 enemies, captured more than 40 alive, and seized one heavy machine gun, one small cannon, a total of two rifle grenades/grenade launchers, more than 40 rifles, more than 70 various artillery shells, and 4,634 rounds of ammunition. Shattering the Chiang bandit’s dream of "grabbing grain for a week" in Anyang. (Bingshou, Mei Wu)
    [Jizhong News] The Jizhong Military Region announced on the 18th: Our army's struggle to protect wheat around Baoding and north of the Daqing River has achieved successive victories. From the 9th to the 16th of this month, the Chiang bandits in Baoding repeatedly dispatched troops to our Hu Zhijia Village, Shijiaqiao, Yuanpingqiao (about ten miles south of Baoding), Wangting, Miyang Village (thirty miles east of Baoding), Da Xia Fu Village, Nan Da Ran, Dong Xi Shiqiao, Jingtangpu and other areas to grab wheat. They were repeatedly and bravely beaten back by our local armed militia, resulting in 454 enemies killed, wounded, and captured, five light machine guns seized, sixty-one rifles, 6,192 rounds of ammunition, and one car destroyed. Under the severe blows of our army, the enemy fled back in panic. In the Daqing River area, our army actively attacked the Chiang bandits who came out to grab wheat while covering the wheat harvest of the masses, and actively rushed to eliminate the local armed forces of the pseudo-bandits. On the morning of the 14th, a unit of our army killed and wounded a total of 24 bandits of the 25th regiment of the security forces south of Anci City in Zhu Guantun. On the night of the 15th, a unit of our army launched a surprise attack on the pseudo-large township of Husigao Village, Gu'an (twenty miles northwest of Baxian), and completely eliminated it. On the 16th, our army again annihilated the entire Yongqing bandit intelligence team and the entire Nanguan large township at the East and West Farms. On the 16th, a unit of our army attacked Nanmeng Town (ten miles northwest) in Baxian, and completely annihilated the defending enemy and the personnel of the pseudo-large township of Dongguan and Haojiawu. The militia and armed work teams of various counties also actively carried out activities to protect the masses in their rush to harvest wheat. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 134 bandits, including Yongqing intelligence team leader Yang Gaizhong, were captured, 20 bandits were killed or wounded, and 86 long and short guns and 1,778 rounds of ammunition were seized.
    [Jizhong News] The militia of Tongzhuangzi, Nancheng, and Suntuo villages in Jinwu (newly established county, parts of Tianjin and Wuqing) repelled the invading Chiang bandits who were dispatched from Deshengkou (twenty miles north of Yongfang) on June 13th in a city defense battle to grab wheat, numbering more than 900 people. The enemy concentrated artillery fire and launched several consecutive assaults, but were repelled by our heroic militia. The militia used high-rise tunnels and flexible and accurate sniper tactics to engage the enemy in village warfare. A militiaman from a certain village, Lü Rui, killed or wounded four enemies with eight bullets. During the battle, the local masses, unafraid of danger, actively participated in the war, delivering water and food to the militia and helping them repair fortifications. After the battle, the masses continued to actively harvest wheat under the armed cover of the militia. In this battle, more than 80 enemies were killed or wounded, and no militiamen were injured or killed.

On the 7th of this month, a unit of our Baibu River force, with lightning speed, made a long-distance raid on the reactionary armed forces of the bandit return-to-hometown corps stationed in Kou'an (south of Mentougou). When our army broke into the village, the enemy was still dreaming and was mostly annihilated by us. In this battle, 36 enemies were eliminated (including more than 20 including the squadron leader Liu Yubao), and two light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, 25 long and short guns, three rifle grenades, and a batch of other military supplies were seized.
