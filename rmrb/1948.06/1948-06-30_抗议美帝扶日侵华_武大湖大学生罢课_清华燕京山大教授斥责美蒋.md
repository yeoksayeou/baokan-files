Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to comprehensive reports from foreign news agencies, the US imperialist policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China continues to provoke strong protests and condemnation from university teachers and students, as well as cultural figures, in various areas under Chiang Kai-shek's control. Students from Wuhan University, Hunan University, and other universities in Wuhan and Changsha held strikes on the 21st of this month in protest. One hundred professors and lecturers from Shandong University in Qingdao issued a declaration on the 23rd, stating: "The Chinese people have the right to oppose any country's policies that threaten China's security, and the current policies of the United States will inevitably allow Japan to return to a position of threatening China." At the same time, students at the university demanded that the U.S. Marines stationed in Qingdao return several buildings they were occupying on the university campus. More than one hundred teachers from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities in Peiping jointly issued a statement on the 19th, denouncing the US policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China and US Ambassador Stuart's insulting statement to the Chinese people on June 4th.

In addition, the Shanghai-based "Observer" weekly, a publication of middle-of-the-road elements, recently published an article protesting the US restoration of Japanese aggression forces. The weekly stated: After the war against Japan, we are watching Japan revive, which will enable Japan to threaten China again in a few years. It is undeniable that the United States is fostering Japanese militarism. The weekly described Stuart's June 4th statement as an "open threat to China." It concluded by pointing out: Everyone who cares about China's future should protest the policy of restoring Japan's aggression forces.

    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合外国通讯社消息：美帝国主义扶日侵华的政策，继续激起蒋管区各地大学师生及文化界人士的严正抗议和斥责。武汉、长沙两地之武汉、湖南等大学学生为此已于本月二十一日举行罢课抗议。青岛山东大学教授讲师等百人，二十三日发表宣言说：“中国人有权反对任何国家威胁中国安全的政策，而美国目前的政策，则不可避免地要使日本恢复到威胁中国的地位。”与此同时，该校学生要求美国驻青岛海军陆战队交还占用该校的数幢房屋。北平清华、燕京两大学教师百余人，于十九日联名发表声明，痛斥美国扶日侵华政策及六月四日美大使司徒雷登侮辱中国人民的声明。
    此外，上海中间分子的刊物“观察”周刊，最近发表论文，对美国恢复日本侵略势力表示抗议。该周刊称：对日战争结束后我们看着日本在复兴，这将使日本能在数年内再度威胁中国。美国扶植日本军国主义是无法否认的。该周刊描述司徒雷登六月四日的声明为“公开威胁中国”。并在结语中指出：每一个关怀中国前途的人都应当抗议恢复日本侵略势力的政策。
