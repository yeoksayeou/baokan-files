　　Lin County Conducts Large-Scale Short-Term Training for Village Cadres
  　Eliminating Concerns to Lead Large-Scale Production
    [Lin County News] In order to resolve the current ideological obstacles of village cadres, enabling them to understand the Party's policies and actively lead production work, the Lin County Party Committee decided at the beginning of last month to conduct large-scale centralized training for village cadres. The entire county was divided into three base points, held in two phases, each phase lasting seven days, with a planned training of three thousand people. The first phase, starting from May 7th, has already concluded at the Sangyuan and Rencun base points. The second phase is currently underway. From the first phase, considering the Sangyuan and Rencun base points, a total of 1,027 cadres participated, with Party members accounting for approximately 80%. Poor peasant cadres accounted for approximately 67%, and middle peasant cadres accounted for approximately 33%. There were no landlord or rich peasant elements; organizations that were impure generally did not exist. Although some of the cadres who attended were actively leading production and consistently adhering to their work, they all exhibited varying degrees of negativity and confusion. Due to misunderstandings regarding the spirit of Party rectification, many cadres urgently demanded: "Even if the Party doesn't want us, even if the masses don't want us, we must still understand clearly." Therefore, the spirit of the training was: linking with the current work inspection, starting from reality, definitely distinguishing right from wrong, differentiating between the important and the minor, separating public and private interests, using the spirit of treating illnesses to save people, helping and transforming them. The general steps were:
    1. Clarifying Policies and Expressing Attitudes.
    Generally, the attitude of the cadres upon arrival was one of widespread suspicion and dissatisfaction towards the Party, passive resistance, holding a "mute enters the temple, kowtowing more and speaking less" attitude, and even some individual attempts at resistance and severe pessimism. After the county committee comrades explained the policies and made self-criticisms regarding the mistakes for which they should be responsible in past work leadership, and clarified their attitude towards village cadres, their emotions were turned around. They all said that the higher-ups were originally well-intentioned, wanting them to stand with the masses, and that they should not have listened to rumors and made arbitrary suspicions. Some were even moved to tears and said: "Alas! We were thinking wildly, not doing work was really wrong!" They generally realized that the higher-ups, in order to make them good cadres and good Party members who could stand with the masses and do their work well, were not rejecting them, nor was it a case of old cadres being unable to cope. They all actively spoke and examined themselves. As a result, everyone said: "So that's how it is, now we understand completely." Some said: "If the meeting had been held a month earlier, wouldn't we have solved the problems earlier?"
    2. Inspecting Current Work and Recognizing One's Own Mistakes.
    Then, the central purpose of the meeting was formally explained to everyone, which was to do a good job in production and disaster relief work. Everyone earnestly examined their own thoughts. The political director of Qinjiapo said: "In order to avoid making mistakes myself, I ignored the collusion of bad people in the village to burn incense, and left for Shanxi. After more than twenty days, because I left, a total of fifteen cadres left the village, and no one was leading the village. The village's seven flour mills and three oil mills were all closed, and no one was leading the masses in transportation. I thought I hadn't made any mistakes this time, certainly no administrative orders were given! But now that I think about it, the losses suffered by the masses were too great. The mistakes of the past have not been corrected, and now I am not leading, isn't this making mistakes on top of mistakes?" After the self-criticism, they universally realized that not leading during this period was making mistakes on top of mistakes and further separating themselves from the masses.
    At the same time, many cadres also examined their historical personal mistakes, determined to go back and lead well, earnestly correct their mistakes, and have a future only by standing with the masses to fight for production together. During the meeting, the number of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against was also statistically calculated for education. For example, in forty villages in the Second District, there were a total of 6,390 households, and 613 middle peasants were wrongly struggled against. In the Tielu joint defense in the Eighth District, more than 1,900 people had been attacked, the majority of whom were peasants. Then, the issue of compensation was naturally discussed, and the difficulties in finding sources were resolved. Generally, many methods were devised; even in villages with limited compensation sources, they voluntarily proposed: adopt the principle of mutual aid production to overcome the disaster.
    Finally, concrete arrangements were made for production and disaster relief work. After the meeting, everyone generally said: This time it was thorough. When we came, we were carrying heavy burdens, and when we left, we unloaded them cleanly. When we came, we didn't want to come, and when we left, we didn't want to leave. (Wang Ying)

　　林县大规模短训村干
  　消除顾虑领导大生产
    【林县消息】林县县委为解除目前村干思想障碍，使其了解党的政策积极领导生产工作，上月初决定大规模集训村干，全县分三个基点，分两期举行，每期七天，拟训三千人。第一期自五月七日开始刻已结束，第二期正在进行中。从第一期桑园、任村两个基点看，参加者共有一千零廿七个干部，党员约占百分之八十。贫农干部约占百分之六七，中农干部约占百分之三三，没有一个地富成份，组织不纯的一般是不存在的。到会干部虽也有若干积极领导生产始终坚持工作的，但均表现或多或少的消极与混乱。由于对整党精神的误解，不少干部迫切要求：“即使党不要自己，群众不要自己，也要弄个清楚。”因之在训练的精神上是：连系当前工作检查，从实际出发，一定要分清是非，分别轻重，分开公私，用治病救人的精神，帮助与改造他们，大致进行步骤是：
    一、讲清政策表明态度。
    一般干部来时的态度，普遍的对党怀疑不满，消极对抗，抱着“哑吧进庙堂、多磕头少说话，”甚至有个别企图对抗，严重悲观。县委同志说明政策后，把过去工作领导上所应负责的错误也做了自我批评。又讲明对村干的态度，扭转了他们的情绪，都说原来上级是一片好心肠，是让咱们和群众往一块站哩，咱们不该听信谣传，随便猜疑，甚至有的被感动的眼里含着泪说：“唉！咱胡思乱想，不做工作真不对呀！”一般体会到了上级为了使他们变成个好干部好党员，能和群众站在一起，把工作做好，并不是排斥他们，也不是老干部吃不开，都积极发言检讨自己。这样一来，大家都说：“原来是这样的呀，这可蹬底了。”有的说：“早开一个月会咱不是早解决了问题吗？”
    二、检查目前工作认识自己错误。
    接着就向大家正式说明这次开会中心目的，是为了把生产渡荒工作搞好，大家认真检查自己思想。秦家坡政治主任说：“为了自己避免错误，村里坏人串通烧香，自己也不管了，起来就往山西走了，廿多天后，因我一走全村一共走了十五个干部，村上没人领导了，村上的七座粉房、三座油房都关了门，群众运输也没人领导，我想这回我可没有错了，总没有行政命令吧！可是现在一想群众受的损失太大了，过去的错误没改，现在又不领导，这不是错上加错吗？”检讨后普遍的认识了这个时期没有领导是错上加错，更加脱离群众。
    同时也有不少干部检讨了历史上的个人错误，决心回去好好领导，认真改错，和群众站在一起共同生产斗争才有前途。会议中又用计算方法，统计了一下错斗中农的数目进行教育，如二区四十个村，共有六千三百九十户，错斗的中农就有六百十三户；八区铁芦联防，曾有一千九百多人被打击过，其中农占多数。接着自然的展开讨论补偿的问题，并解决了来源的困难，一般都想出了不少办法；即便补偿来源不多的村庄，也自动提出：采取互助生产的方针，渡过灾荒。
    最后，具体布置了生产渡荒工作，散会后一般都说：这次可透了，来时背着包袱重重的，走时卸得干干净净，来时不想来，走时不想走。（王莹）
