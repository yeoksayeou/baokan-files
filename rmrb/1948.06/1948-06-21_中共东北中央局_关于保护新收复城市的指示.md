　　CCP Northeast Bureau
  　Directive on Protecting Newly Recovered Cities
    (June 10, 1948)
    (I) Since the summer offensive last year, many cities in the Northeast have been successively recovered by our army. The few isolated cities where the Chiang army is now trapped will soon be completely recovered by our army. In the past, during our army's guerrilla warfare period, we basically relied on the vast countryside, and we occupied relatively few cities, and we often could not hold these cities. Therefore, although we have always paid attention to urban policy and opposed indiscriminate arrests and confiscations, after occupying cities, it was necessary and correct to strategically, systematically, and organizationally remove certain essential materials from the cities. Now the situation has fundamentally changed. We have not only occupied many cities, but these cities have been firmly owned by the people. The war is now a large-scale concentrated operation of large army groups, which not only relies on the vast countryside, but also on the cities. If we do not change our past views and still look at the cities with the old perspective, then we are wrong. During the civil war and the war of resistance, we did not have cities for a long time and felt the pain of not having cities. Now that we have cities, we should cherish them, give full play to the role of cities, and make cities produce more military supplies and daily necessities to support the war and to prosper the economy of the liberated areas. The current war cannot achieve final victory without the support of cities and the transportation of railways. Every revolutionary soldier, local party and government personnel, and people in the liberated areas should regard cities as an indispensable force for the people's revolutionary war to achieve final victory; should strictly abide by the party and government's industrial and commercial policies, urban policies, and laws; oppose the departmentalism of indiscriminate seizure of materials; oppose the one-sided so-called mass viewpoint; and prevent destruction of cities and damage to industry and commerce. Not only that, even if some cities may be repeatedly contested with the enemy after occupation, they should not be destroyed, because those cities will belong to the people sooner or later.
    (II) In the cities recovered in the past, except for a few cities, actions violating the party's urban policy and industrial and commercial policy have occurred. Although the Northeast Bureau, the Northeast Military Region Headquarters, and the Political Department have repeatedly instructed the attacking troops and local party committees that they must strictly implement the party's urban and industrial and commercial policies, and although many improvements have been made in this regard, the phenomenon of violating urban policies and infringing upon industry and commerce continued to occur even when capturing Siping, Anshan, and recovering Jilin. The following are the circumstances that gave rise to violations of urban policies and infringements on industry and commerce: First, some attacking troops had lax discipline and insufficient education on urban policies and industrial and commercial policies, and they indiscriminately seized materials out of departmentalism, violated discipline, and disregarded policies. Second, some duty personnel in the troops, such as personnel from supply, health, communications, and transportation units, used the pretext of "military use" and the pretext of confiscating Chiang Kai-shek and puppet regime's "enemy property," thereby infringing upon industry and commerce, moving equipment, dismantling parts, taking away belts, damaging factory equipment, etc. Third, some production personnel from various units in the rear only cared about the interests of their own units and rushed to newly recovered cities to purchase materials and engage in business, disrupting the financial prices of the newly recovered cities. Fourth, some urban poor, due to the hunger and extreme poverty caused by the Kuomintang, took the opportunity to "make a fortune" during and after the war, and the troops often took a laissez-faire attitude from the one-sided so-called mass viewpoint, without persuading or prohibiting them. And the lurking special agents and hooligans took the opportunity to sabotage and make trouble. Fifth, peasants in the suburbs automatically entered the city to seize fleeing landlords for liquidation, thereby destroying some of the industry and commerce connected with the landlords.
    The city and industry and commerce suffered the most serious damage: First, the public enterprises, shops, hospitals, and municipal organs of Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet regime. After the troops and personnel of various units opened the city, they did not regard these enterprises and properties as the state's people's enterprises and properties to be protected and cherished, but still regarded them as the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet regime's enterprise properties, and moved and dismantled them at will, causing serious losses. Second, the private enterprises and shops that had connections with Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet regime or were jointly owned with Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet regime, because the boundaries between their enemy property and private property were not clearly distinguished, the goods and equipment of these enterprises and shops were moved away and dismantled, resulting in losses. Third, enterprises and shops that had no connection with Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet regime were suspected of being related to the enemy simply because the Chiang Kai-shek army troops and wounded soldiers were stationed in them during the war, and thus suffered infringement.
    (III) The reasons for these situations are: First, insufficient understanding of the important role of cities in the new situation, no understanding of the principle that some materials could be moved out of the cities in the past, but now can only be transported, still looking at the cities from the perspective of guerrilla warfare, still looking at the cities from the perspective of the countryside, still thinking that the occupation of cities is only temporary. Second, the party's policy of protecting industry and commerce and the policy of protecting cities were not sufficiently taught in the troops and among the organ personnel. Third, there was no understanding that the partial interests of one unit should be subordinate to the overall interests of the revolution, and no understanding that the temporary interests of individuals should be subordinate to the permanent interests of the revolution. Fourth, the troops did not strictly enforce discipline, and there was a compromising idea of ​​emphasizing that "the troops are struggling, it is inevitable to take a little something." Fifth, military control was not implemented in the early stage of occupying the city, and the responsibility for protecting the newly occupied city was clearly and fully handed over to the highest command organ of the attacking troops. It should be pointed out that the most important reason for these phenomena is that the commanders, political commissars, and political workers of some troops, as well as the leaders of some local party and government, did not strictly implement the party's industrial and commercial policies and urban policies, and even adopted a liberal attitude.
    (IV) In order to make the newly recovered cities better in the future, and to protect the newly recovered cities and industry and commerce from destruction, and to quickly serve the war and the people, it is specifically decided:
    First, a short-term military control system will be implemented in the newly occupied cities. In the initial stage of occupying the city, the highest command organ directly under the attacking troops must be responsible for the military management of the city, and all local party and government organs and staff entering the city must obey its command. To this end, a military management committee can be organized, with the participation of local party and government leaders, and the entire responsibility for protecting the newly occupied city will be borne by the military management organ. The commanders and political commissars in charge of military management must adopt the most responsible attitude towards the party, the democratic government, the People's Liberation Army, and the people to protect the newly recovered city. The length of the military management period shall be determined by the higher military command organ according to the situation of our army and the situation of the city. After the order of the city is generally stable, an order shall be issued to abolish military control and transfer all the powers of city management to the city party committee and the city government, and designate a certain troop as the city garrison force. The garrison headquarters is under the leadership of the city party committee, and the secretary of the city party committee concurrently serves as the political commissar of the garrison force. When handling the handover, formal handover procedures must be implemented, and no carelessness is allowed; and a meeting should be held to review the work during the military management period to distinguish responsibilities.
    Second, the military management organs in the early stage of the newly recovered city and the subsequent municipal government and municipal party committee have full authority to deal with all events and criminals who violate urban policies and laws. However, they must have close contact with the higher-level leading organs and the Northeast Administrative Committee and the Northeast Bureau; all major events must be reported to the higher-level for instructions in advance and reported afterwards.
    Third, matters to be observed by the attacking and entering troops:
    A. It is necessary to conduct education on the party's urban policy and industrial and commercial policy among all military, political, and logistical cadres down to the soldiers, and for the designated attacking troops, it is necessary to specifically conduct education on the discipline of entering the city to protect the city and protect industry and commerce before the battle. This education must be checked to see whether it is universal and whether it is in-depth.
    B. It is stipulated that the attacking troops only have the responsibility to protect the city's industry and commerce, and have no power to confiscate and dispose of it. The attacking troops have no power to confiscate and dispose of Chiang Kai-shek and puppet regime's public enterprises, banks, shops, municipal organs, hospitals, school warehouses, and private enterprises, shops, etc. On the contrary, during and after the battle, the attacking troops should send out necessary teams to protect them and prohibit anyone from entering without authorization to move machinery, materials, and equipment.
    C. It is stipulated that the enemy personnel that the attacking troops can capture are limited to the enemy's armed forces and other personnel who resist with guns; the criminals who can be arrested are limited to the enemy's military spies, economic and social order saboteurs, and obvious important war criminals. All other law-abiding enemy civil servants, personnel from economic and cultural organs, and police officers should not be captured and arrested; instead, they should be encouraged to remain in their original posts under the command and order of certain organs and personnel on our side, guard the original organs, factories, warehouses, materials, and documents, and continue to maintain necessary work, awaiting clearing and handover, and must not be negligent, damage, or conspire to sabotage.
    D. It is stipulated that the materials that the attacking troops can handle are limited to ammunition and weapons on the battlefield, other military supplies, and military materials. And a single attacking troop has no right to handle these military materials; they must be properly kept on behalf, and a list must be submitted to the highest command and political department of the attacking troops, which will be submitted to the headquarters for unified handling. Logistical supply personnel can only follow the troops to do the logistical supply work of the troops themselves, and they are absolutely prohibited from leaving their own duties and indiscriminately seizing materials, so that everything seized can truly be returned to the public (this is one of the three major disciplines of the People's Liberation Army); and appropriate and reasonable distribution becomes possible.
    E. After the end of the battle, except for a certain number of troops needed to maintain order in the city, all other troops should withdraw from the city. Before withdrawing, the factories, warehouses, banks, municipal organs, etc. that are guarded must be clearly handed over. All troops are not allowed to be stationed in factories, hospitals, schools, and churches.
    F. Strictly implement rewards and punishments. Those who have contributed to complying with the industrial and commercial policy and the urban policy will be given spiritual and material rewards. Those who violate the urban policy and the industrial and commercial policy must be thoroughly investigated, and dealt with according to law based on the seriousness of the circumstances.
    Fourth, matters to be observed by the rear party, government, military, and civilian organs:
    A. All personnel of the rear organs (including party, government, military, and civilian organs and groups at the Northeast level and at the provincial, city, and county levels), during the period of military control, except for those who are sent to the newly recovered cities to perform certain work, shall not send people to the newly recovered cities to purchase materials or do business.
    B. Personnel who have been approved by certain organs at the Northeast level must work under the leadership of the city's military management organs and the subsequent municipal government and municipal party committee after entering the newly recovered city. If any such personnel are found to be undermining the industrial and commercial policy and the urban policy, the local municipal government may at any time revoke their right to stay in the city and give them punishment.
    C. Local party committees, governments, and peasant associations, especially the county and district organizations near the city, must also educate local peasants not to enter the city to arrest criminals and confiscate materials on their own. If it is necessary to enter the city to arrest local tyrants and criminals, it must be approved by the municipal government and carried out legally by the municipal government.
    (V) This directive should be discussed in the party committees of each province, column, and division in connection with the review of past work; and it should be universally and thoroughly conveyed in the troops from cadres to soldiers, and among all personnel in local party and government organs.

  　关于保护新收复城市的指示
    （一九四八年六月十日）
    （一）从去年夏季攻势后，东北许多城市相继为我军所收复；蒋军现在困守的几个孤城，亦即将为我军所全部收复。过去在我军游击战争时代，我们基本上是依靠广大农村，占领的城市不但比较少，而且常常不能保住这些城市。所以虽是我们从来即注意城市政策，反对乱抓乱没收，但在占领城市之后，从城市中有政策地有计划地有组织地搬运出某些必需的物资，是必要的，正确的。现在形势已经根本变化了。我们不仅占领了很多城市，而且这些城市已巩固地为人民所有。战争已是大规模的大兵团的集中作战，不仅要依靠广大的农村，而且要依靠城市。如果我们不改变过去的观点，还以旧的观点来看待城市，那就是错误的了。在内战时期，抗战时期，我们长期没有城市，感受没有城市的痛苦。现在我们有了城市，就应当爱护城市，发挥城市的作用，使城市产生更多的军需品和日用品来支援战争，来繁荣解放区的经济。现在的战争没有城市的支援，没有铁路的运输，是不能取得最后胜利的。每个革命军人，地方党政人员，解放区人民，都应该把城市看作是人民革命战争取得最后胜利决不可少的力量；应该严格遵守党和政府的工商业政策，城市政策和法令；反对乱抓物资的本位主义；反对片面的所谓群众观点，防止破坏城市，破坏工商业。不但这样，现在即使某些城市在占领后还可能同敌人反复争夺，也不应加以破坏，因为那些城市迟早也是属于人民的。
    （二）在过去所收复的城市中，除少数城市外，都曾发生过违犯党的城市政策和工商业政策的行动。东北局、东北军区司令部和政治部，虽曾经屡次对攻城部队和地方党委指示，必须严格执行党的城市和工商业政策，虽在这方面已经有了许多改进，但一直到攻占四平、鞍山，收复吉林时，违犯城市政策和工商业政策的现象仍然继续发生。产生违犯城市政策及侵犯工商业的有下列几种情形：第一，是某些攻城部队纪律不严，对它的城市政策、工商业政策教育不够，本位主义地乱抓物资，违犯纪律，不讲政策。第二，是某些部队的执勤人员，如供给、卫生、通讯、辎轮等机关人员，借口“军用”，借口没收蒋伪“敌产”，因而侵犯工商业，搬运器材，拆卸零件，拿走皮带，损害工厂设备等等。第三，是某些后方机关各单位的生产人员，只顾本单位的利益，到新收复的城市抢购物资，做买卖，扰乱新收复城市的金融物价。第四，一部分城市贫民，由于国民党造成的饥饿与极端贫穷，在战争中及战争结束后乘机“发洋财”，而部队人员时常从片面的所谓群众观点出发，不仅未加说服与禁止，反而采取放任态度。而潜伏的特务分子和流氓，则更加乘机破坏捣乱。第五，四郊农民自动进城抓逃亡地主清算，因而破坏一部分同地主有联系的工商业。
    城市和工商业遭受破坏最严重的：第一，是蒋伪的公营企业，商店，医院，市政机关。各部队、各单位的人员在城市打开之后，没有把这些企业和财产看作是国家的人民的企业财产加以保护和爱护，而仍然看作是蒋伪企业财产，随便搬运拆卸，致使遭受严重损失。第二，是过去与蒋伪有联系的或与蒋伪合股的私人企业，商店，由于其敌产部分与私产部分的界限未被分别清楚，因而使这些企业商店的货物器材被搬走、拆卸，以致遭受损失。第三，是与蒋伪无联系的企业商店，仅仅因为战争时期蒋军部队和伤兵驻扎在内，以致被怀疑与敌人有关，因而遭受侵犯。
    （三）产生这些情形的原因：第一，是由于对新形势下城市的重要作用认识不够，对过去可以从城市中搬运某些物资，而现在只能搬运的道理没有认识，还是以游击战争的观点，还是以农村的观点来看城市，还是以为占领城市只是暂时的。第二，是党的保护工商业政策及保护城市的政策，在部队中和机关人员中教育不够。第三，是对一个单位的局部利益应该服从革命的整个利益没有认识，对个人的暂时利益应该服从革命的永久利益没有认识。第四，是部队严格的执行纪律不够，有强调“部队艰苦，背一点东西是难免的”的迁就思想。第五，是没有实行占领城市初期的军事管理，把保护新占领城市的责任明确地全部交给攻城部队的最高指挥机关。应当指出：产生这些现象的最重要的原因，是由于某些军队的指挥员、政治委员、及政治工作人员、以及某些地方党政的领导人，没有严格地贯彻党的工商业政策和城市政策，甚至采取自由主义的态度。
    （四）为使今后新收复的城市能够搞得更好些，使新收复城市和工商业免于破坏，很快就能为战争为人民服务，特决定：
    第一，在新占领城市实行短期的军事管理制度。在占领城市初期，必须由攻城部队直接最高指挥机关担任该城的军事管理，所有入城工作的地方党、政机关及工作人员，一律听其指挥。为此，可以组织军事管理委员会，吸收地方党、政负责人参加，将保护新占领城市的全部责任，交由军事管理机关担负。担任军事管理的司令员和政委，必须向党、向民主政府、向解放军、向人民采取最负责的态度，来保护新收复城市。军事管理期间的长短，依我军情况与城市情况，由更高的军事指挥机关规定之。在城市秩序大体稳定后，即命令宣布取消军事管理，把城市管理的全部权限交给城市市委、市政府，并指定一定部队为城市卫戍部队。卫戍司令部受市委领导，市委书记兼卫戍部队的政委。在办理交代时，必须实行正式移交手续，不得马虎；并应开会检讨军事管理时期的工作，分清责任。
    第二，新收复城市初期的军事管理机关及以后的市政府和市委，有全权处理一切违反城市政策和法纪的事件和人犯。但他们必须与上级领导机关及东北行政委员会和东北局有密切联系；一切重大事件，必须事先向上级请示，事后作报告。
    第三，攻城及入城部队应遵守事项：
    甲、必须普遍的从军政后勤干部直到战士进行党的城市政策、工商业政策的教育，对指定的攻城部队，必须在战斗之前专门进行爱护城市、保护工商业的进城纪律教育，对这种教育必须检查是否普遍，是否深入。
    乙、规定攻城部队只有保护城市工商业之责，无没收处理之权。攻城部队无论对蒋伪公营企业、银行、商店，市政机关、医院、学校的仓库及私人企业、商店等，均无没收处理之权。相反地，在战斗中及战斗结束后，攻城部队应派出必须的队伍加以保护，禁止任何人擅自进去搬运机器、物资和器材。
    丙、规定攻城部队可以俘虏的敌方人员，只限于敌方武装部队及其他持枪抵抗的人员；可以逮捕的人犯，只限于敌方的军事间谍，经济的和社会秩序的破坏分子，以及明显的重要战犯。其他一切守法的敌方公务人员，经济机关与文化机关的人员和警察等，不应加以俘虏及逮捕；而应赞成他们在我方一定机关和人员的指挥与命令之下，留在原来岗位，看守原来的机关、工厂、仓库、物资和文件，并继续维持必要的工作，听候清理与交代，不得怠职毁损和阴谋破坏。
    丁、规定攻城部队可以处理的物资，只限于战场上的弹药、武器，其他军用品及军用物资。而单个攻城部队亦无权处理此项军火物资；必须妥为代管，开列清单，呈报攻城部队的最高司令部及政治部，由后二者呈报总部，统一处理。后勤供给人员，只能随部队做部队本身后勤供给工作，绝对禁止他们离开本身职务，而乱抓物资，这样就可真正做到一切缴获归公（这是解放军的三大纪律之一）；而适当地合理分配，也就成为可能了。
    戊、攻城部队在战斗结束后，除需要维持城市秩序的一定数量的部队外，其他部队均应撤出城外。在撤出前，必须将看守之工厂、仓库、银行、市政机关等移交清楚。所有部队，一律不准驻在工厂、医院、学校和教堂。
    己、厉行奖励与处罚。对遵守工商业政策及城市政策有功者，给予精神的和物质的奖励。违反城市政策及工商业政策者，必须彻底追究，并依据情节轻重，依法处办。
    第四，后方党政军民机关应遵守事项：
    甲、一切后方机关人员（包括东北一级和各省市县级党政军民机关团体），在军事管理时期，除派往新收复城市担任一定工作者外，均不得派人到新收复城市去购卖物资或做生意。
    乙、经过东北一级一定机关批准的人员，在进入新收复城市后，必须在城市军事管理机关及以后的市政府市委领导之下进行工作。凡发现此项人员有破坏工商业政策及城市政策者，当地市政府得随时取消其在该市留住之权，并给以处分。
    丙、各地党委、政府、农会，尤其是该城附近的县区组织，并必须教育当地农民，不得进城自行逮捕人犯及没收物资。如必须进城抓恶霸罪犯时，必须经过市政府批准，并须由市政府合法进行。
    （五）这一指示，应在各省，各纵，各师党委中，联系检查过去工作，进行讨论；并应在部队中从干部到战士，在地方党政机关所有人员中，进行普遍的深入的传达。
