　　【Ji Lu Yu News】Nianying Village in the Fifth District of Nanfeng did not clearly explain the spirit of the policy to the masses, and the boundaries for resettling landlords and compensating middle peasants were not clearly defined, so the landlords took the opportunity to exploit loopholes and engage in activities. Landlord Li Zhenlan (before the struggle, five family members, 130 mu of land, and often hired two laborers and one farmer, himself not participating in major labor) was swept out during the re-examination. His wife married into Wang Village and has now returned. The women's chairman, Wang Xiuying, had no one at home, and he silently removed the millstone door. The village cadre gave him land, but he didn't want it. He told the poor peasant Erchun, "The five mu of wheat land west of your house is my land," and threatened the poor peasant. Landlord Li Baoyin (six family members, 100 mu of land, hired one laborer and one farmer, himself not participating in major labor) and rich peasant Li Zhenjia moved their houses without the village cadres knowing. Li Qing＠, Li Zhenjia, Li Zhenbao, and other six landlord and rich peasant families started dismantling bricks without telling the village cadres, dismantling the foundations of two houses, taking away more than 6,000 bricks, which made the poor peasants feel uneasy. The poor peasant (widow) Zhang said, "The landlords are returning home! My broken house has also collapsed. Where am I going to live? I'm really worried!" The district learned about the landlords' activities and sent comrades Ma Xiu'e and Huang Peinan to investigate the village. On the 25th of last month, they called the landlords and rich peasants together and lectured them: "If you don't have anything to eat, you will be given what you should be given, but you can't make trouble, and you can't ask the masses for things casually; the fruits are the farmers' blood and sweat, they are the farmers' things; granting you a share is to ask you to produce well, whoever dismantled the bricks must report it and return the things they took!" They also held a mass meeting, explaining the policy in detail. The landlords returned the things they took. The landlords are now bowing their heads to the masses and admitting their mistakes, and the poor peasants feel relieved after taking stock.
    【Ji Lu Yu News】Cadres in Machang District Let Things Slide, Allowing Landlords and Rich Peasants to Counterattack and Retaliate Against Village Cadres. Yuan Keshi, the secretary of the Machang Village branch in the Fourth District of Neihuang, is a poor peasant and a veteran. After returning home, he started as the village chief. Last year, during the land reform, because he was very capable in his work, the masses elected him as the chairman of the peasant association. Later, he became the village branch secretary. The landlords and rich peasant elements who were struggled against in the village hated him very much. The general masses did not have many opinions about the secretary. The chairman and vice-chairman of the village peasant association, Yuan Tongju and Yuan Qinghai, still had some opinions about the secretary during the land reform, and they were not united with each other. The landlord and rich peasant elements in the village took advantage of this loophole. When the secretary was not at home (attending a meeting in the district), the landlord and rich peasant elements told the peasant association chairmen Yuan Tongju and Yuan Qinghai, "The secretary has been arrested!" These two peasant association chairmen, under the control of the landlord and rich peasant elements, led the households that were struggled against and some of the masses who were dissatisfied with Yuan Keshi to rob his house clean on May 18. Comrade Zhang Kexin, the district cadre working in this village, thought it was the opinion of the masses and ignored it, becoming the tail of certain masses.

　　碾营村不让地主钻空子
  　马场区村干部受了地主的骗
    【冀鲁豫消息】南峰五区碾营村没有把政策的精神向群众解释明白，安置地主和补偿中农的界限没划清，地主便钻空子，乘机活动。地主李振兰（斗争前五口人、一顷三十亩地，并经常雇两个扛活的，一个种地的，本人不参加主要劳动）复查时被扫地出门，他老婆嫁给王庄，现下回来了，妇会长王秀英家里没人，他不吭声把磨道门摘去，村干给他地他不要，他找贫农二春说：“你家西那五亩麦子地是我的地，”威胁贫农。地主李保印（六口人，一顷地，雇一个扛活的，一个种地的，本人不参加主要劳动）、富农李振佳两家搬房子，村干都不知道就搬啦。李清＠、李振佳、李振保等六家地富，没给村干说，就扒起砖来，共扒了两座房子根，扒去六千多砖，这样就弄的贫农都心神不安。贫农（孤寡）张氏说：“地主还家哩！我的孬房子也塌了，上哪里去住，真愁的没法！”区里了解地主活动，便派马秀娥、黄培南同志到这村调查。上月二十五号，把地主富农叫在一块训了他们一顿：“你没啥吃，该给你就给你，不能乱闹，更不能随便向群众要东西；果实是农民的血汗，是农民的东西；恩赐你一份，是为了叫你好好生产，谁扒的砖都得报出来，拿的东西都得送回去！”又召开了一个群众会，详细的讲明了政策，地主拿的东西送回来。地主现在向群众低头认错了，贫农摸底后，安心啦。
    【冀鲁豫消息】马场区干放任不管，地主富农反攻报复村干。内黄四区马场村支书袁克实是个贫农，是荣誉军人，回家后，开始当村长，去年在土改时因为他很能干工作，群众就把他选成了农会主任，后来他又当了村支书，村里被斗的地主富农分子，很恨他，一般的群众对支书意见并不多，这村农会正副主任袁同聚、袁清还在土改时对支书有些意见，彼此不团结，这村地主富农分子便钻了这个空子。当支书不在家（到区开会去了），地主富农分子向农会主任袁同聚、袁清还说：“支书被扣了！”这两个农会主任，在地主富农分子的掌握下领着被斗户及一部分对袁克实不满的群众，于五月十八日把他家里的东西抢了一个光。在这村工作的区干张可心同志，他却认为是群众意见，就不管不问，当了某些群众的尾巴。
