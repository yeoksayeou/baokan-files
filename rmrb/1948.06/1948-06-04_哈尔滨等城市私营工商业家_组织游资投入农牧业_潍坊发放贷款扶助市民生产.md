Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st Dispatch: Private industrialists and businessmen in the three major cities of Harbin, Jiamusi, and Qiqihar are enthusiastically responding to the government's call to organize idle funds and invest in agricultural and animal husbandry production, considering it a good way to make profits at present. Xingdongguan, Yuanjixiang Zhi Yongsheng, and three other oil mills, as well as Tianxingfu flour mill in Harbin, have leased 292 hectares of land in Jianghua Village on the outskirts of the city. They are currently purchasing horses, vehicles, and fertilizers and will soon begin cultivation. Xingdong Oil Mill has also obtained government approval to develop 20,000 square meters of land in the Majia District of the city, planning to invest 100 million yuan (each yuan equivalent to 50 yuan of Guannei Jiang currency, same below) to establish a livestock farm. Construction has already begun, and it is expected to raise chickens, rabbits, and dairy cows this year. The municipal government is also assisting them in solving feed problems and purchasing high-quality breeds. In Jiamusi, dozens of grain, industrial, food, and small workshops have decided to establish farms. In the third district alone, eight industrialists and businessmen have invested in operating two large farms. Labor and management have signed contracts and will soon begin cultivation. Tianxingdong Oil Mill and Dongxing Distillery have jointly invested more than 25 million yuan and decided to reclaim 100 hectares of wasteland in Huachuan County. They have already purchased 18 horses and hired 15 workers. Zhenzi and six other soy sauce gardens plan to invest more than 20 million yuan to establish a farm in Huachuan County. Labor and management have agreed that the management will provide livestock, farm implements, seeds, houses, furniture, etc., and the workers will provide labor for cultivation. The workers will be responsible for their own food and clothing, and after the autumn harvest, the management will receive 45% of the grain, and the workers will receive 50%. Except for horse grass, which is borne by the management, the remaining expenses will be borne in proportion to the grain distribution. In Qiqihar City, the investment of industrialists and businessmen in the second district alone has reached more than 6 million yuan. Farmers in various places have expressed warm welcome to industrialists and businessmen investing in agriculture, reclaiming farms, and developing agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st Dispatch: The Weifang branch of the Beihai Bank has recently launched a small loan of 100 million Beihai currency to support citizens in developing production. This loan focuses primarily on laborers, such as unemployed workers, small handicraft workers, and small vendors who play a role in regulating the market and rely on labor. To ensure that the loans are given to those who urgently need them, the branch has specially dispatched more than ten cadres to go deep into the urban area, conduct door-to-door visits, starting from one street and gradually expanding. The amount of money needed by the masses is based on self-reporting and public discussion, and then democratically assessed.
