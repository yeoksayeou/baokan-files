Xinhua News Agency, North China, 31st: To the political organs of the secondary military regions of the field armies, administrative offices, and to the military sub-districts, special districts, and county and city governments:

This year's wheat harvest in our region is quite good, while the Kuomintang-controlled areas are suffering from a severe grain shortage. After the wheat harvest, the enemy will inevitably use military looting and the large-scale purchase of non-essential goods to plunder our wheat. It is reported that the enemy in Tianjin has issued loans of one trillion (Kuomintang currency) to purchase wheat in our region. The enemy in Tianjin, Baoding, Taiyuan, Xinxiang, and Anyang has begun to organize wheat-grabbing institutions and is dumping goods such as salt, foreign cloth, and matches, actively preparing to plunder wheat from our region. In order to protect the fruits of the people's production and thwart the enemy's plot to plunder wheat, all military, government, and civilians in our border region must be urgently mobilized to launch a wheat protection struggle. This is the central task of the current struggle against the enemy in the border region. To this end, it is necessary to:

(1) During the wheat harvest, our field army corps, local people's armed forces, militia, and guerrillas, in addition to specific combat missions, should extend their activities to the border areas to actively fight the enemy, implement the combination of labor and military affairs, with a sickle in one hand and a gun in the other, to cover and help the masses with the wheat harvest.

(2) In the border areas, the masses should be mobilized and organized to harvest quickly, strike quickly, and hide quickly, not letting the enemy grab a single grain of wheat; and regardless of class or wealth, the masses should be mobilized to transport wheat to relatives and friends in the interior for storage, to protect the grain of the liberated areas and avoid losses.

(3) Before and after the wheat harvest, economic work should focus on protecting wheat, not giving the enemy any loopholes, and severely打击(dǎ jī - strike, hit) the enemy's plot to plunder from an economic perspective. Arrangements will be made separately for summer grain requisition and purchase, and import and export management.

It is hoped that this will be studied and implemented in accordance with the actual situation in the local area.

  　发布护麦指示
    【新华社华北三十一日电】各野战军二级军区司政机关行署并转各军分区各专署各县市府：
    今年我区小麦收成尚佳，蒋管区则严重缺粮，麦收后敌人必以军事上的抢掠与倾销非必需品大量收购等等办法，掠夺我之小麦。据报天津敌已发出贷款一万亿（蒋币），收购我区小麦。天津、保定、太原、新乡、安阳之敌，已开始组织抢麦机构，并倾销食盐、洋布、火柴等物，积极作抢掠我区小麦之准备。为保护人民生产果实，打击敌人掠夺小麦的阴谋，我边缘区全体军政民，必须紧急动员起来，展开护麦斗争，这是边缘区当前对敌斗争的中心任务。为此必须：
    （一）在麦收中我野战兵团、地方人民武装、民兵、游击队，除特定的作战任务外，应伸展到边缘区积极活动，打击敌人，实行劳武结合，一手镰刀一手枪，掩护并帮助群众麦收。
    （二）在边缘区应动员与组织群众，快收、快打、快藏，不让敌人抢走一颗麦子；并应不分阶级不分贫富，动员群众把麦运到内地亲友处储存，保卫解放区粮食，免遭损失。
    （三）麦收前后经济工作，应以护麦为中心，不给敌留一点空隙，从经济上予敌人掠夺阴谋以严重打击。至于夏征购麦出入口管理等工作，另有布置。
    希即按照当地实际情况研究执行。
