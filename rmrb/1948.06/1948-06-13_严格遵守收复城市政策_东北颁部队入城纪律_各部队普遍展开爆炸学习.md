Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. To ensure that troops strictly abide by policies and regulations after entering cities, the Northeast People's Liberation Army posted the following eight articles of the "Regulations for Entering Cities" on May 25th: (1) Protect the lives and property of the people in the city. (2) Protect factories and shops, prohibit dismantling machinery, removing materials, or privately confiscating or forcibly purchasing. (3) Protect schools, hospitals, scientific and cultural institutions, urban public facilities, scenic spots, historical sites, and buildings. (4) Take care of enemy warehouses, materials, and other property, implement the principle of confiscation for public use, do not compete, do not destroy, do not freely use, do not lay ambushes, and await and obey the distribution of higher authorities. (5) Do not interfere with or infringe upon law-abiding churches, temples, and foreign nationals. (6) Implement polite speech, fair trade, return borrowed items, and compensate for damages. (7) Obey the discipline and rules of the garrison organs, abide by public order, do not enter brothels, do not disturb the people, and do not fire guns without reason. (8) Cherish the reputation of the People's Liberation Army, everyone observes discipline, everyone acts as a propagandist, and implements consistency between words and deeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. All units of the Northeast People's Liberation Army are universally launching explosion studies. Based on past combat experience, they are reviewing the reasons for the success and failure of explosions, studying improvement methods, and conducting repeated exercises. The Fourth Company of a certain unit reviewed the experience of explosion and strong cooperation in the Siping battle. Many people pointed out that some cadres did not pay attention to tactics and were impatient, only knowing to order charges. The Fourth Squad of the company, linking up with the main reasons why several previous blasting operations had failed, was that the deputy platoon leader did not look at the terrain, did not clarify the task, and did not look after the blasting point. He just called the blasting team to go up without organizing firepower or completely blocking the enemy's gunholes, which increased unnecessary casualties. The cadre training class of a certain regiment reviewed that continuous blasting in the past often dared not follow up immediately because the organization was not good, fearing that the package would explode. Sometimes the detonator fuse was not properly connected. If the detonator needle was not inserted into the medicine, it would not sound, etc. When the cadre training team of a certain unit conducted exercises on continuous blasting, they adopted the method of rotating exercises and rotating comments, gaining the following experience: 1. When issuing orders and assigning tasks, the terrain, enemy situation, communication liaison signals, etc. must be clearly explained. 2. When suppressing the enemy's bunker with firepower, it must be aimed at its gunholes, fired into the bunker, and not given the enemy a chance to breathe. When the sapper is about to approach the bunker, the machine gun should immediately raise the aiming point to avoid killing its own people. 3. Explosives and blasting tubes should be placed in appropriate places. 4. The sapper's actions should be swift, and the distance between the assault team and the sapper team should not be too far, but not too close, and should be based on the principle that they can immediately break in after the explosion is effective.

　　严格遵守收复城市政策
  　东北颁部队入城纪律
    各部队普遍展开爆炸学习
    【新华社东北十日电】东北人民解放军为了确保部队在攻入城市后严格遵守政策和纪律，特于五月二十五日贴布入城纪律守则八条如下：（一）保护城市人民的生命财产。（二）保护工厂商店，禁止拆毁机件，搬取物资或私自没收强购。（三）保护学校、医院、科学文化机关及城市公共设备，名胜古迹和建立物。（四）看管敌人的仓库物资及其他财产，实行缴获归公，不争夺，不破坏，不自由动用，不打埋伏，听候和服从上级分配。（五）对守法的教堂寺院及外国侨民，不得干涉和侵犯。（六）实行讲话和气，买卖公平，借物归还，损坏赔偿。（七）服从卫戍机关的纪律和规则，遵守公共秩序，不入妓院，不滋扰人民，不无故鸣枪。（八）爱护人民解放军的名誉，人人守纪律，人人作宣传，实行言行一致。
    【新华社东北十日电】东北人民解放军各部，普遍展开爆炸学习。根据过去实战经验，检讨爆炸成功和失败的原因，研究改进办法，反复演习。某部四连检讨四平战斗中爆炸与大力配合的经验，许多人提出有些干部不讲战术，犯急性病，光知道叫冲。该连四班连系过去几次爆破都没成功主要原因，就是副排长不看地形，不弄清任务，也不看好爆破点，就叫爆破组上去，没有组织火力，没有完全封锁住敌人的枪眼，因之增加了不必要的伤亡。某团干部训练班，检讨过去连续爆破往往不敢接踵而上，就是因为组织不好，怕炸了包，自己有时雷管导火线接不好。如雷管的针未插到药里，因此拉不响等。某部干训队演习连续爆破时，采取轮流演习，轮流评论的办法，得以下几点经验：一、下达命令交代任务时，必须把地形敌情通讯连络信号等交代清楚。二、火力封锁敌地堡时，须对准它的枪眼，打进地堡，并且不给敌人以喘息机会。当爆破手将要接近地堡时，机枪应立即将瞄准点抬高，以免杀伤自己人。三、炸药和爆破筒应安置在适当的地方。四、爆破手的动作要迅速，突击组与爆破组距离不可太远，但也不能太近，应以爆破奏效后能立即突进为原则。
