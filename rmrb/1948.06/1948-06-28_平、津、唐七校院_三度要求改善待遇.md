Xinhua News Agency, North China, June 26th: According to a report in the Tianjin Dagongbao, eleven units including the lecturer and teaching assistant associations, staff associations, and worker-police associations of seven universities and colleges in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan – Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal College, Peiping Research Institute, Nankai University, Peiyang University, and Tangshan Institute of Technology – jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Weng Wenhao, and Zhu Jiahua on the 2nd of this month for the third time, demanding improved treatment due to soaring prices and increasingly desperate living conditions. The demands included: 1. Continue to allocate two bags of flour per person per month, starting from February, at the January allocation price, and implement the distribution of other daily necessities; 2. Pay salaries monthly according to the actual local cost of living index, and increase the basic salaries of workers, police, and technicians; 3. Adjust academic research funds and subsidies monthly, etc. Note: Except for Tangshan Institute of Technology, the faculty, staff, and worker-police of the other six schools had already submitted similar demands for improved treatment to the Chiang government twice before, on April 6th and May 6th, but were rejected each time.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 26th: The anti-hunger struggle in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has spread to the staff of the Kuomintang's highest party headquarters. According to news from Tianjin newspapers, more than 200 staff members of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, dissatisfied with the Kuomintang authorities' unreasonable deduction of their May salaries and allowances (according to the Chiang government's regulations, May salaries and allowances were to be issued at 310,000 times the base salary, but in reality, only 240,000 times were issued), gathered on the 2nd of this month to petition Wu Tiecheng, the Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, demanding the supplementary payment of the deducted 70,000 times salary. Wu Tiecheng not only refused to meet them but also ordered the guards to stop them. The angry staff members immediately beat up Qu Feiping, the deputy captain of the guards, and tore his clothes.

  　三度要求改善待遇
    【新华社华北二十六日电】据天津大公报披露：北平、天津、唐山三市的北大、清华、师院、北平研究院、南开、北洋、唐山工院等七院校之讲师助教会、职员会、工警会等十一单位，以物价飞涨，生活日陷绝境，已于本月二日第三度联合致电蒋介石、翁文显、朱家骅，要求改善待遇。提出：一、按一月份所配售面粉之价格，自二月份起，每人每月继续配面两袋，并实行配发其他生活必需品；二、逐月按当地实际生活指数发薪，并提高工警技工底薪；三、逐月调整学术研究费及补助费等。按：除唐山工院外，在此以前，其他六校教职员工警早在四月六日及五月六日即已两度向蒋政府提出此等改善待遇要求，但均遭拒绝。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】蒋区反饥饿的斗争已经扩展到国民党最高党部的职员中。据津报消息：南京国民党中央党部职员二百余人，不满国民党当局无理克扣他们所应领到的五月份薪津（照蒋政府规定，五月份薪津均按底薪三十一万倍发给，但实际上仅发给二十四万倍），乃于本月二日齐集向蒋党中央党部秘书长吴铁城请愿，要求补发被克扣的七万倍薪资，吴铁城非但拒不接见，反令警卫队加以阻止，愤怒的职员们当即将该警卫队副队长曲非萍痛殴一顿，并撕毁了他的衣服。
