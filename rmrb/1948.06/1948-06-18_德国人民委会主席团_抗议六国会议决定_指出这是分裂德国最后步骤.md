　　German People's Committee Presidium
  　Protests Six-Nation Conference Decision
  　Points Out This is the Final Step in Splitting Germany
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS Berlin dispatch: The Presidium of the German People's Committee, currently the sole national representative body of the German people, passed a resolution on June 7th, strongly protesting the decision of the London Six-Nation Conference regarding the establishment of a divided West German state. The resolution stated: The decision of the London Conference is the final step towards dismembering Germany. It does not even mention a peace treaty but expresses the intention of imposing occupation on the German people. This decision runs counter to the Potsdam Agreement, which is the guarantee of the legitimate rights of the German people. The Presidium of the People's Committee, representing the entire German nation, calls on every German not to participate in the policy of splitting Germany and urges German citizens to participate in the German unification signature campaign, thereby expressing their natural desire for unification and demanding its realization. The Berlin press also widely criticized the decision of the London Six-Nation Conference. The "Daily Review" pointed out: If this decision is implemented, West Germany will be reduced to an American colony. The trade union's "Forum" newspaper wrote: The outcome of the London Conference has clearly demonstrated why Western countries do not like Germans collecting signatures for petitions demanding German unification, because they fear the overwhelming majority of Germans in the east expressing their will in favor of their country's unification. They want to govern the 40 million people of West Germany by the same methods they usually use to rule colonial peoples.

　　德国人民委会主席团
  　抗议六国会议决定
  　指出这是分裂德国最后步骤
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社柏林讯：现为德国人民唯一全国性代表机关的德国人民委员会主席团，于六月七日通过决议，强烈抗议伦敦六国会议关于建立分裂的西德国家的决定。决议称：伦敦会议的决定是走向肢解德国的最后一个步骤。其中甚至不提和约，但却表示了向德国人民强施占领的意图。这种决定与波茨顿协定背道而驰，而后者乃是德国人民合法权利的保障。人民委员会主席团，代表整个德国民族要求每一德国人不参加分裂德国的政策，并敦促德国公民参加德国统一签名运动，借以表达其自然的统一愿望，并要求其实现。柏林报界亦广泛抨击伦敦六国会议的决定，“每日评论”报指出：如果该项决定付诸实施，西德即将降为美国殖民地；职工会的论坛报写道：伦敦会议的结果已完全清楚地说明为什么西方国家不喜欢德国人为要求德国统一的请愿书征集签名，因为他们惧怕东部压倒多数的德人表示他们赞成自己国家统一的意志，他们想用他们惯常统治殖民地人民的方法，来治理西德四千余万人民。
