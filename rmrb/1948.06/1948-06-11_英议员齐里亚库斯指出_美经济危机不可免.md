Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS dispatch: A Hungarian journalist recently interviewed British Member of Parliament Zilliacus. When discussing the difficulties of US imperialism, Zilliacus told the reporter: "The US government believes that the Marshall Plan is insufficient to avoid a US crisis. If the US cannot trade with the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, then an economic catastrophe in the US will be inevitable. The statement in the US note to the Soviet Union that elections will not affect US policy is not true. The main issue lies precisely in this aspect. The current rulers of the US are attempting to use this statement to reduce Wallace's chances of winning, and to try to prove that they, like Wallace, are striving for peace. Naturally, this is their own 'peace,' the fruits of which will be harvested by Wall Street." When discussing the Soviet Union's peace policy, Zilliacus pointed out: "When the Soviet Union agreed to negotiate, it fulfilled the responsibilities of all peace-loving nations. In this way, the Soviet Union once again proved its unwavering commitment to peace. We cannot even imagine how much new support this move by the Soviet Union has gained for the cause of peace." Zilliacus also discussed Anglo-American relations, saying: "It would not surprise anyone if the US government takes steps without even informing Britain. Britain's opinions have been ignored countless times, and it has consistently been forced to find solutions helplessly. Because Britain has locked itself onto the US purse strings, it has finally lost its independence."

　　英议员齐里亚库斯指出
  　美经济危机不可免
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：匈牙利记者最近访问英国会议员齐里亚库斯。在论及美帝的困难时，齐氏告记者称：“美国政府认为马歇尔计划是不足以避免美国危机的，假如美国不能与苏及新民主主义国家贸易，则美国的经济灾难将是不可避免的。美国致苏联照会中所说：选举将不会影响美国政策的话，并非事实。主要的问题恰恰在这方面，美国今日的统治者企图以这一声明减少华莱士获胜的机会，并企图证明他们和华莱士一样是力争和平的。自然，这是他们自己的‘和平’，这‘和平’的果实将由华尔街去收获。”论及苏联的和平政策时，齐氏指出：“当苏联同意谈判时，它就履行了所有爱好和平国家应负的责任，这样，苏联再一次证明了它对和平的不屈不挠的志愿。我们甚至无法想象，苏联此举争取了多少对和平事业的新的支持者。”齐氏又论及英美关系，他说：美国政府所将采取的步骤，甚至都不通知英国一下，这是不会使任何人吃惊的。英国的意见曾经无数次的被忽视，它一贯地被迫在无可奈何中想办法。由于英国把自己锁在美国的钱袋上，它已最后丧失了独立。
