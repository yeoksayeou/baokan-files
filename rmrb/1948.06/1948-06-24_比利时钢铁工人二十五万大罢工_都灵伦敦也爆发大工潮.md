　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st - According to a United Press report from Brussels: Labor-management negotiations in the Belgian steel industry have reached a deadlock; 250,000 steelworkers have announced a strike starting on the 16th. This is the largest strike since the end of the war. The striking workers are demanding a 5% wage increase, bringing the minimum hourly wage to $0.35 and the minimum monthly wage to $69. According to United Press, "It is generally believed that the Belgian steel industry has made huge profits since Belgium's liberation in 1944. Production has reached 110% of pre-war levels, with monthly steel production reaching 315,000 tons." The shutdown of Belgium's largest industry (steel) has affected all factories in the country's provinces. Union officials estimate that if the current strike lasts more than three or four days, virtually all of Belgium's industry will be paralyzed. Negotiations between employers and union representatives were still ongoing on the 16th, with the government (led by Prime Minister Spaak), continuing to act as "mediator," having "secretly instructed employers to stand firm and not to yield to the workers' demands under any circumstances" (United Press).
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st - Rome dispatch: "Italy has experienced its largest strike since the elections" (Associated Press). The event occurred on the 15th in Turin, Italy's second-largest industrial center, lasted 24 hours, and was declared victorious on the 16th. The Turin general strike was triggered by sympathy for the demands of workers at the local Lancia car factory. On the 14th, workers at the Turin Lancia car factory protested a company decision to reduce the weekly work hours from 48 to 40, with a corresponding reduction in wages, and went on strike. The factory immediately responded by closing the factory and sending a large number of police to suppress the workers. Turin workers then launched a general strike in support of the factory, and the general strike resulted in an agreement being reached in labor-management negotiations at the Lancia company.
    London dispatch: The strike by dockworkers and other port workers here, which began last weekend, had expanded to 4,000 people by the 15th and then to 12,000 on the 16th. More than ninety ships have been idled, bringing "the normally bustling activity to a standstill" (Agence France-Presse) in London, one of the world's largest ports. The strike is in protest of the Labor Ministry's Special Arbitration Tribunal's sanctions against eleven workers who refused to load zinc oxide because the company would not give them a special bonus for doing a dirty job.
    Another item: 4,500 workers in Oldham, Lancashire, staged a sit-down strike on the 15th because the Platt Brothers textile mill fired a worker representative.

　　比利时钢铁工人二十五万大罢工
  　都灵伦敦也爆发大工潮
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据合众社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时钢铁工业之劳资谈判已陷僵局；廿五万钢铁工人已于十六日起宣布罢工。这是战争结束以来的最大一次罢工。罢工工人要求增资百分之五，使每小时最低工资能达美金三角五分，每月最低工资能达美金六十九元。据合众社称：“一般认为，比利时钢铁工业自一九四四年比国解放以来，已获巨大利润。生产额已达战前水平百分之一百一十，每月钢产量达三十一万五千吨。”比利时最大工业（钢铁工业）的停顿，使全国各省的一切工厂都受到影响。工会方面估计，如果目前的罢工持续三四天以上，则比利时的全部工业实际上将陷于瘫痪。雇主与工会代表之谈判十六日仍在进行中，继续充当“调停人”之政府（以内阁总理斯巴克为首）已“密令雇主，要他们坚持不变，无论如何不答应工人的要求”。（合众社）
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】罗马消息：“意大利爆发了大选以来最大的一次罢工”（美联社）。此一事件于十五日发生于意大利第二大工业中心都灵，历时二十四小时，已于十六日宣告胜利结束。都灵总罢工系因同情该地兰夏汽车厂工人之要求而引起。十四日，都灵兰夏汽车厂工人，因厂方决定将每周开工时间由四十八小时缩短到四十小时，工资按比例减少，遂举行抗议罢工。厂方当即使用关厂手段对付工人，并叫大批警察到厂镇压。都灵工人即举行总罢工以支援该厂，总罢工的结果，促成了兰夏公司之劳资谈判获致协议。
    伦敦消息：上周周末开始的此间码头工人及其他港口工人的罢工，十五日已扩大至四千人，十六日复增至一万二千人。九十余艘船只已经停驶，使世界最大港口之一的伦敦港“经常热闹的活动陷于停顿”（法新社）。此次罢工为抗议劳工部特别仲裁法庭对十一名工人的制裁，这些工人因为资方不允给他们做一肮脏工作的特别奖金而拒绝装运氧化锌。
    又息：兰开夏旧汉姆城之四千五百名工人，因浦拉蒂布洛斯纺织袜厂辞退了一个工人代表而于十五日举行静坐罢工。
