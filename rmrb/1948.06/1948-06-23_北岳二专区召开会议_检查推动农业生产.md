The Second Special District of Beiyue Convenes a Meeting
　　Inspects and Promotes Agricultural Production

　　[Beiyue News] In mid-May, the Second Special Administrative Office of Beiyue convened a second production conference. After twenty days of reporting, inspection, and discussion, it summarized past production achievements and determined future production guidelines. In some marginal areas of the Second Special District, enemy bandits frequently harassed and sabotaged, and the consolidated areas frequently supported the front, which, coupled with last year's famine, added many difficulties to this year's organization of production. Thanks to the government's great efforts in leading production, distributing loan grains, and organizing the masses to overcome the famine, considerable achievements have been made. In agriculture: the autumn crops were all planted ahead of schedule according to the season (Shouyu only planted 40% due to enemy harassment), and weeding is currently underway. Early-maturing crops all exceeded last year's levels. In terms of eliminating cultivated wasteland: according to statistics from six villages in Yangqu, Dingxiang, Wutai, and Pingding, 441 mu of wasteland have been sown. In terms of purchasing livestock, 160 villages in just five counties of Wutai, Dingxiang, Shouyu, and Yangqu added 843 head of livestock. In terms of regulating seeds, Dingxiang regulated 108 shi of barley, Wutai regulated 34 shi of wheat, and Shouyu regulated more than 22,500 jin of corn. The number of seeds regulated by the masses themselves was even greater; three villages in Meng County alone regulated 9,420 jin of Chinese yam. Afforestation and tree planting also exceeded previous years. Meng County, Wutai, Yangquan, Dingxiang, Yangqu, and other five counties and cities, along with the Special Administrative Office, planted a total of more than 143,000 trees. In terms of industry and mining: in Pingding, from last winter to March of this year, the number of coal mines increased from 81 to 125, and the output increased from 1.45 million jin per day to 3.9 million jin. The number of iron mines increased from 87 to 270, and the output of sulfur increased from 12,000 jin per month to 20,000 jin. In terms of overcoming the famine: Pingding and Yangquan did a better job. In Hanzhuang, 352 human-powered carts were developed this spring, ensuring that the masses overcame the disaster. In the 2nd and 6th districts of Meng County, various transportations were organized, earning a total of more than 219,000 jin of millet. Immigrants near Niucun established 81 groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, totaling 1,890 people. The textile industry organized 876 people, basically solving the problem of food. In terms of grain loans: as of May 20, a total of more than 2.415 million jin of grain and more than 190 million yuan (border currency) were loaned, solving the difficulties of many people. At the meeting, based on the three guidelines and tasks of the Beiyue District's May public resolution, specific production requirements were put forward for different regions: in the consolidated areas, such as the basic areas of Meng County, Wutai, Pingding, Yangquan, and Dingxiang, ensure that not a single mu of cultivated land is left uncultivated, eliminate cultivated wasteland (Meng County is determined to eliminate 2,333 mu, and Dingxiang 3,000 mu): implement intensive farming and careful cultivation, hoe once and loosen twice, repair terraced fields, build dams and ditches, and be ready to support the front at any time. Agriculture, sideline, handicraft, and industrial and mining industries should be fully developed. In areas where the enemy may launch surprise attacks, such as the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th districts of Dingxiang, and the 5th district of Yangqu, combine labor and military. Marginal areas, such as Shouyu and the 7th district of Meng County, and the 3rd district of Yangqu, should fight and produce at the same time. The meeting especially discussed plans to increase agricultural production: the entire special district will continue to open small canals, increasing the irrigated area by 2,165 mu. Restore old wells to irrigate 300 mu of land. Build dams to protect land and form beaches for 1,750 mu. The Puji District of Dingxiang will increase the irrigated area by 5,000 mu. Improve production tools. A handcart promotion agency will be established in Pingding, lending 100 shi of grain to increase the number of handcarts by 500 this year. Promote improved varieties. The Meng County Promotion Agency will exchange 50 shi of Qin Prefecture yellow millet seeds after autumn, and promote them on a large scale. Each county should exchange 300 shi of good wheat seeds. Advocate accumulating fertilizer, striving for one sheep per household. Press a large amount of green manure, requiring the completion of 150 million jin. Breed livestock, 300 head in Meng County and 100 head in Yangqu. The textile industry should promote self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-use, and restore and develop it in a planned way. At present, strengthen the wheat protection struggle in Ding, Ping, Shou, and Yu counties, organize committees to unify command, implement militia joint defense, launch political offensives, and mobilize all labor to rush to harvest. In order to complete the above production tasks, everyone is required to mobilize and create a production upsurge. "Cadres in the production department should devote 100% of their energy to leading production, and other cadres should also devote 50% of their energy to production work" (Editor's note: Leading organs should devote most of their energy to leading production work.) The Special Administrative Office organized two work teams, one to Wutai and one to Pingding, to specifically help supervise and inspect production. The Special Administrative Office, counties, and districts will organize a joint office composed of responsible party and government cadres, the industrial section, and the promotion agency to specifically lead and study production. The village level will be led by the representative assembly and the New Farmers' Association. At all levels, establish long-term and continuous key production villages, two in the special area, three at the county level, and two at the district level. Villages should fully help several households absorb experience and promote production. And use folk schools, blackboards, and other methods to publicize the party's policies, resolutely oppose the state of anarchy, strengthen organization and discipline, and be pragmatic and do things honestly bit by bit.

　　北岳二专区召开会议
  　检查推动农业生产
    【北岳讯】北岳二专署于五月中旬，召开二次生产会议，经二十天的汇报检查与讨论，总结了过去的生产成绩，确定了今后生产方针。二专区某些边沿区域，敌匪经常扰乱破坏，巩固区又经常支前，再加上去年的灾荒，给今年组织生产增加不少困难。由于政府用很大力量领导生产，发放贷粮贷款，组织群众渡荒，获得相当成绩。农业方面：大秋作物按季节都提前种完（寿榆因敌扰乱仅种了百分之四十），目前正在锄苗，早熟作物都超过了去年。在消灭熟荒方面：据阳曲、定襄、五台、平定六个村统计，有四百四十一亩荒地都下了种。购买牲畜，仅五台、定襄、寿榆、阳曲五个县一百六十个村即新增牲口八百四十三头。调剂籽种，定襄调剂大麦一百零八石，五台调剂小麦三十四石，寿榆调剂玉麦等二万二千五百多斤。群众自己调剂的数字更大，仅盂县三个村即调剂山药九千四百二十斤。造林植树也超过往年，孟县、五台、阳泉、定襄、阳曲等五个县市和专署共植树十四万三千余株。工矿业方面：平定从去冬到今年三月，煤矿由八十一座发展到一百廿五座，产量由日出一百四十五万斤增至三百九十万斤，铁矿由八十七座增至二百七十座，硫磺由月出一万二千斤增至二万斤。渡荒方面：平定、阳泉作的较好，韩庄十个村，今春人力小车发展了三百五十二辆，保证群众渡过了灾荒。盂县二、六区，组织各种运输，共赚小米二十一万九千多斤。牛村附近的移民、建立了八十一个农业副业结合的小组，共一千八百九十人，纺织业组织了八百七十六人，基本上解决了吃饭问题。贷粮贷款方面：截至五月二十日，共贷出粮二百四十一万五千多斤，款十九万万多元（边币），解决了许多群众的困难。会上根据北岳区五月公议决议的三条方针任务，对不同地区，提出不同的生产具体要求：在巩固区，如盂县、五台、平定、阳泉、定襄的基本地区，保证不荒一亩熟地，消灭熟荒（确定盂县消灭二千三百三十亩，定襄三千亩）：实行精耕细作，锄一搂二，修理梯田打坝成沟，并随时准备支前，农副手工工矿等业要全面放手开展。在敌可能突击的地区，如定襄一、二、六、七区，阳曲五区，实行劳武结合。边沿区如寿榆和盂县的七区，阳曲的三区等，一面战斗，一面生产。会上特别讨论了增加农业生产的办法计划：全专区继续开小渠，增加水浇地二千一百六十五亩。恢复旧井浇地三百亩。打坝护地成滩一千七百五十亩。定襄普济区增加浇地面积五千亩。改良生产工具，在平定设小车推进社，贷粮百石，在今年增加小车五百辆。推广优良品种，盂县推进社要在秋后换回沁州黄谷种五十石，大量推广，各县要换好小麦种三百石。提倡积肥，争取一户养羊一只。大量压绿肥，要求完成一万万五千万斤。繁殖牧畜，盂县三百头，阳曲一百头。纺织业提倡自纺自织自用，有计划的恢复与发展。在目前，特别加强定、平、寿、榆等县的护麦斗争，组织委员会统一指挥，实行民兵联防，开展政治攻势，动员一切劳力，突击抢收。为了完成以上生产任务，要求大家动员起来，造成一个生产的热潮，“生产部门干部以百分之百的精力来领导生产，其他干部也以百分之五十的精力来做生产工作”（编者按：领导机关应以大部精力领导生产工作。）专区组织两个工作队，一个到五台，一个到平定，专门帮助督促检查生产。专区、县、区级由党政负责干部及实业科、推进社组织联合办公室，专门领导与研究生产，村级由代表会、新农会领导。各级要确定长年不断的生产重点村，专区二个，县级三个，区级二个，村级要全力帮助几户吸收经验，推动生产。并利用民校、黑板报等方式，宣传党的政策，坚决反对无政府状态，加强组织性，纪律性，实事求是一点一滴老老实实去办事。　　　　　　　（久成）
