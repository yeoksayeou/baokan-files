Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th – Traitor Chiang Kai-shek, having barely ascended to the bogus "presidency," is already facing open calls for his "resignation" from some of his American masters who have lost faith in him. The Republican newspaper, the New York Herald Tribune, published an editorial on the 18th, openly declaring that Chiang Kai-shek's "prestige has diminished daily," advocating that "the most drastic step would be the Chairman's resignation, yielding his position to Vice President Li Zongren," or "transferring his current power to a wartime emergency cabinet" (referring to Weng Wenhao). The US official news agency, the "United States Information Service," broadcast the full text of this editorial. As early as the bogus National Assembly meeting in April this year, some American political figures were already contemplating the next step for Chiang Kai-shek after his election as bogus president, which was to go abroad at some point. The New York Herald Tribune is so eager to abandon Chiang Kai-shek because "the fundamental policies adopted by the Chairman since the victory over Japan have failed," and the People's Liberation Army, "although limited in strength at the beginning of the war, now controls almost the entire Northeast, most of North China, and a considerable area of the Yangtze River basin. They are now approaching the capital, Nanjing, and China's largest city, Shanghai." The Chinese public believes that the American imperialists still want to utilize Chiang Kai-shek for a period of time in reality, so they will not immediately consider the suggestions of the New York Herald Tribune, but will try to devalue Chiang Kai-shek like his "legal tender," so as to more cheaply control the Nanjing government and army. In any case, it is an unchangeable fact that Chiang Kai-shek's "prestige has diminished daily," not only in front of foreigners, but also in front of ordinary Chinese people, and within the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang army.

### 蒋介石价值日廉　美报喊着要他下野　美帝还想廉价用他

　　蒋介石价值日廉
  　美报喊着要他下野
  　美帝还想廉价用他
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】卖国贼蒋介石刚刚爬上伪“总统”的位子不多几天，对他丧失信心的某些美国主子就开始公开地喊着要他“下野”了。美共和党报纸纽约先驱论坛报十八日发表社论，公开宣称蒋介石的“威信已与日俱减”，主张“最激烈之步骤莫过于委员长之辞职，让位于副总统李宗仁”，或者“以其现行权力移交与一战时紧急内阁（按指翁文灏）”。美官方新闻机关“美国新闻处”广播了这个社论的全文。早在今年四月伪国大开会期间，某些美国政界人物即已盘算着蒋介石当选伪总统后在某种时机下，出洋的次一步骤了。纽约先驱论坛报这样急于想抛弃蒋介石，是因为“自对日胜利以来委员长所采取之基本政策业已失败”，人民解放军“在战事初起时虽实力有限，但现已控制几乎整个东北、大部华北及长江流域不小地区。彼等现正迫近首都南京及中国最大之城市上海”之故。中国公众相信美帝国主义者现在在实际上还要利用蒋介石一个时期，因此不会立即考虑纽约先驱论坛报的建议，但将尽量使蒋介石象他的“法币”一样地不断贬值，以便更廉价地管制南京的政府和军队。无论如何，蒋介石不但在外国人面前，在普通中国人面前，而且在国民党内和国民党的军队内，“威信已与日俱减”，则是一个不可改变的事实。
