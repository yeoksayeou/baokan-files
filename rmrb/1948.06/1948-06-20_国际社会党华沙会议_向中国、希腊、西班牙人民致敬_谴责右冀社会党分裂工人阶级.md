　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: TASS reports: The International Socialist Party Conference was held in Warsaw from June 1st to 6th. Representatives attending the conference included Blanc of the French Socialist Unity Movement, Szakasits of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, Basso of the Italian Socialist Party, Fierlinger of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, Jäkobsson of the Finnish Socialist Unity Party, and Cyrankiewicz of the Polish Socialist Party. The conference passed a resolution warmly saluting the heroic Chinese people, the fighting Greek people, the soldiers fighting for the Spanish Republic, the people of Israel, and all those fighting against international imperialism. The conference resolved to "support the Italian Socialist Party's struggle for Italian democracy within the People's Democratic Front, and condemn Saragat and Lombardo for splitting the Italian working class." The resolution emphasized: "The Italian working-class movement, which unites eight million of the most conscious and determined democratic fighters, is a force that reactionaries cannot resist for long." In its resolution on the overall political situation, the conference condemned the right-wing socialist parties of sixteen European countries who met in Vienna (which "expelled" the Italian Socialist Party and absorbed the reactionary Saragat faction that split from the party), stating: "The right-wing socialists who are trying to split the working class have betrayed the proletariat and become loyal 'third force' servants of imperialism, and the internal division of the working class is a tool for splitting Europe politically and economically." The resolution further pointed out: "The Eastern European countries, due to the realization of industrial nationalization and land reform, due to planned economies and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, due to the united action of the domestic working class and the alliance between workers and peasants and various progressive groups, and due to the victory over Fascism, have made incomparably greater progress in economic recovery than the Western European countries." The resolution also pointed out: "The United States is supporting the fascist countries and neo-fascist tendencies in Europe, attempting to restore German aggressive imperialism as a European gendarme. The heads of American imperialism are trying to subject the Western European countries to the interests of American monopoly capital through the Marshall Plan. The result of all this is a decline in the living standards of the masses, unemployment, and the destruction of the sovereignty and independence of these countries."

　　国际社会党华沙会议
    向中国、希腊、西班牙人民致敬
  　谴责右冀社会党分裂工人阶级
    【新华社陕北电】塔斯社报导：国际社会党会议于六月一日至六日在华沙举行，出席此次会议者有法国社会主义统一运动代表勃朗古，匈牙利社会民主党代表斯查卡西兹，意大利社会党代表巴苏，捷克斯拉夫社会民主党代表费林格，芬兰社会统一党代表贾柯邦，波兰社会党代表斯伦凯维兹等。会议通过决议，向英勇的中国人民，战斗中的希腊人民，为西班牙共和国而战的战士，以色列国人民以及一切与国际帝国主义战斗的人们热烈地致敬。会议决议“声援意大利社会党在人民民主阵线组织内争取意大利民主的斗争，并谴责萨拉盖特和伦巴多分裂意大利工人阶级的活动。决议着重指出：“团结了八百万最有觉悟最具决心的民主战士的意大利工人阶级运动，是反动派不能长久抵抗得住的力量。”会议在其关于总的政治形势的决议中，斥责刻在维也纳举行的欧洲十六国右冀社会党会议（它“开除”了意大利社会党吸收了自该党分裂出来的反动的萨拉盖特派）称：“力图分裂工人阶级的社会党右派已背叛了无产阶级成为替帝国主义效劳的忠诚的第三种力量，而工人阶级的内部分裂，乃是使欧洲政治与经济上分裂的工具。”该决议案又指出：“东欧各国由于实现了工业国有化与土地改革，由于计划经济及与苏联之间的经济合作，由于国内工人阶级的统一行动以及工人与农民及各进步集团间的联盟，由于战胜了法西斯主义，它们经济恢复的进展已无可比拟地大过于西欧各国。”该决议案并指出：“美国支持着欧洲的法西斯国家及新法西斯主义的倾向，力图借此恢复德国的侵略的帝国主义，作为欧洲的宪兵，美帝国主义的头子们正试图通过马歇尔计划使西欧各国臣服于美国独占资本的利益，这一切的结果，就是群众生活水准下降、失业和这些国家主权与独立的毁灭。
