    Comrade He Qin:
    Your water pipe shop was stopped from operating without reason. You should request the village to allow you to continue operation. According to our industrial and commercial policy, those that have been confiscated or sealed up but not yet distributed should be returned to the original owners for operation unconditionally.

    Comrade Liu Qinghe:
    Regarding your family background, the information you provided is not clear enough, making it difficult to determine. Regarding your textile handicraft factory, it should be handled according to the industrial and commercial policy in the future.

    Comrades Shang Jin and Yan Zhen:
    Regarding the 800,000 yuan of funds belonging to Niu Zhencheng that were stored in the Xingtai freight yard and were withdrawn by your village to be lent to the masses for use, it should be returned to the original owner immediately.

    The deposit of the household that was struggled against in Baifan Village has been confiscated. There is still 10,000 yuan in funds in the cooperative, which should be returned to the original owner.

    Comrade Zheng Zhimin:
    Yang Pizhi's pharmacy should be returned to the original owner.

    Comrade Xinli:
    The family background of this widowed old woman is not explained in detail. If the kiln was rented out due to a lack of labor in the family, it should not be confiscated. If it has already been confiscated, it should be returned.

    贺勤同志：
    你之水烟店，无故被停止营业，应向村中要求，继续经营。在我工商业政策下，已被没收或查封尚未分配者，是无条件退出原主经营。刘庆和同志：
    关于你家庭成份，说的情况不太清楚，很难确定。关于你纺织手工业工厂，今后应按工商业政策处理。尚金、阎珍同志：
    关于牛振成存于邢台货栈资金八十万元，由你村抽出，借给群众使用，应即退还原主。
    没收白凡村被斗户存款，现仍在合作社有一万资金，应归还原主。郑志民同志：杨丕之药铺，应退还原主。辛里同志：
    这个寡妇老婆，家庭为何成份，说明不详。如因家庭缺乏劳动力，而将缸窑出租，即不应没收。如已没收，即应退还。
