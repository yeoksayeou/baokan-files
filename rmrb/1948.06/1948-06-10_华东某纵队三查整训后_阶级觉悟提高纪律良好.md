Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 6th. After three check-ups and rectifications, the class consciousness of a certain column of the East China People's Liberation Army has generally improved, and there has been significant progress in mass discipline and military-civilian relations. In the past, due to one-sided emphasis on military needs, it was thought that some violations of mass discipline were inevitable in order to win battles. For example, some people said: "You want the horse to run fast, but you don't want the horse to eat grass, how can that be done?" But after the rectification, things have completely changed, and attention has been widely paid to protecting seedlings. For example, during an exercise, a certain battalion proposed to treat the wheat seedlings as a big river, and stepping on the wheat field would be considered drowning; in a certain unit, the 7th company was blocked by a river on their assault route, and the entire company preferred to wade through the water, and no one detoured to trample on the seedlings; another unit, the 7th company, in order to avoid target practice in the fields and damage to the wheat seedlings, designed a shooting aiming range, drawing several target rings on the wall of the village, with a platoon of prone firing positions in front, a platoon of kneeling firing positions in the middle, and a row of standing aiming frames in the rear, occupying a small area, and allowing the entire company to practice at the same time; the 3rd battalion of a certain unit also suggested that all the column's livestock wear muzzles to prevent them from gnawing on seedlings and bark. When the entire column damaged farmers' farm tools while helping the masses in production, they automatically saved on food expenses to compensate them, and apologized to the masses. Some units also set up "mass opinion boxes", and the masses provided opinions to the troops without any sense of estrangement. The masses in the area where the 3rd battalion of a certain unit was stationed directly helped the troops transform the cadres, pointing out that the platoon leader in charge of the 8th company swore at people, and the deputy company commander of the 7th company had a bad attitude, but also said that the machine gun and artillery company was a model unit, good in every way. The masses in the area where the 4th company of a certain unit was stationed went to the company headquarters to request that a meritorious service be recorded for the transport worker Xu Erxiao, because he helped the masses deliver fertilizer for seven mu of land by himself. Currently, based on their existing achievements, the commanders and fighters of the column are preparing to be tested in practical actions.

　　华东某纵队三查整训后
  　阶级觉悟提高纪律良好
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线六日电】华东人民解放军某纵队，经三查整训后，阶级觉悟普遍提高，群众纪律、军民关系有显著进步。过去由于片面强调军事需要，认为要打胜仗就难免违犯些群众纪律，如有人就说：“又要马儿好，又要马儿不吃草，怎么能行呢？”但经过整训后，就完全变样了，从保护青苗来说，已引起普遍注意。如演习中，某部一营提出把麦苗当大河，踏了麦田就算被淹死；某部七连冲锋道路为河流所阻，全连宁愿下水涉渡，没有一人绕道踏青苗；另部七连，为避免在田野打靶，损害麦苗，设计了一个射击瞄准场，在村边墙上多划几节靶环，前面是一个排的卧射工事，中间是一个排跪射工事，再后是一排立射瞄准架，占地不大，又可使全连同时实习；某部三营，又建议全纵队牲口都戴上笼嘴，以防啃坏青苗和树皮。全纵队在帮助群众生产中，损坏了农民的农具时，自动节省伙食费进行赔偿，并向群众道歉。某些单位还设置了“群众意见箱”，群众对部队也无隔阂地提供意见。某部三营驻地群众，直接帮助部队改造干部，他们指出八连管理排长开口骂人，七连副连长态度不好，又说机炮连是模范，啥都好。某部四连驻地群众，到连部要求替运输员徐二小记功，因为他一人帮助群众送了七亩地的肥料。现该纵队指战员在已有成绩的基础上，正准备到实际行动中再去考验。
