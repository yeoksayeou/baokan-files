Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet police teams and local Chiang Kai-shek reactionary armed forces in the newly established Huanglong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, including Luochuan,中部 (Zhongbu), Yijun, Huanglong, and Hancheng counties, have been basically cleared out over the past three months, thanks to our coordinated political disintegration and military suppression. At the beginning of March, when the sub-district was initially liberated, there were more than 4,700 local Chiang Kai-shek personnel. As of the end of May, we had disintegrated, won over, and eliminated more than 3,800. Enemy remnants such as Ding Kunshan and Gu Qitu have either fled out of the territory or scattered deep into the mountains, and we are continuing to pursue, suppress, and win them over. In carrying out the cleanup work, the political disintegration methods adopted included distributing the "People's Liberation Army Declaration" and various leaflets everywhere, writing slogans everywhere to promote the policy of preferential treatment for prisoners, and organizing battlefield appeals, putting forward slogans such as: "Liberate Huanglong, local people don't fight local people!", "Brothers who have been conscripted, don't die for Hu Zongnan!", "Protect the lives and property of those who surrender!" These slogans deeply touched the hearts of the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had been deceived into joining the army. In mid-March, more than 600 police team members from the whole of中部 (Zhongbu) county, except for 20 who fled, surrendered to us. More than 200 local Chiang Kai-shek personnel from Yijun fled south of Tongguan, and upon learning of our policy of preferential treatment for prisoners, they also voluntarily returned to surrender. A police team from a township in Hancheng, while fleeing towards Dali, had members who suggested: "Let's surrender to the People's Liberation Army! Our homes are here, what will we do if we run away with Hu Zongnan?" That night, one member fired a shot and threw two grenades, shouting "The People's Liberation Army is here!", and the team completely collapsed, with some sitting on the road waiting for us to take them in.

　　政治瓦解及军事剿灭配合下
  　黄龙土蒋渐告肃清
    【新华社西北廿八日电】陕甘宁边区新建的黄龙分区洛川、中部、宜君、黄龙、韩城等县的蒋伪保警队及土蒋反动武装，三个月来，在我政治瓦解及军事剿灭配合之下，基本上已告肃清。三月初该分区初解放时。共有土蒋四千七百余人。截至五月底，已经我瓦解争取及消灭三千八百多人。歼敌丁坤山、顾启图等零股散匪或逃窜出境，或流散深山，现仍继续剿捕争取中。在进行肃清工作时所采取的政治瓦解方法，除到处散发“人民解放军宣言”及各种传单，到处写标语宣传优待俘虏政策外，并组织战场喊话，提出：“解放黄龙，地方人不打地方人！”、“被抓当兵的弟兄们不要为胡宗南送死！”、“保护投诚者生命财产”等口号，深深打动了被欺骗当兵的土蒋士兵的心坎。三月中旬，中部全县六百多保警队员除二十人逃散外全部向我投诚。宜君土蒋二百多人逃至同官以南时，得悉我优俘政策，也自动返回投诚。韩城某乡保警队在向大荔逃窜途中，即有队员提出：“向解放军缴械算了！咱们家在这里，跟胡宗南跑下去怎么办？”当夜一个队员打了一枪和两手榴弹，喊了一声“解放军来了”，该队即全部溃散，有的就坐在公路上等我收容。
