[This report from JiluYu on the 1st] The Second River Defense Repair Office reported on the 12th: Gaocun is the largest emergency works project on the upper reaches of the south bank of the Yellow River. Because the enemy destroyed it when they occupied Dongming City, the seventh dam already has the danger of collapse. Director Wang of the Yellow River Committee personally went to the First and Second Repair Offices to arrange emergency repair work, preparing for night repairs. After the enemy got this news, they immediately sent armed forces from the city to live in Gaocun and Li Da, constantly shooting at the opposite bank to disrupt our repair work. The seventh dam sluice collapsed for fifteen meters under such circumstances. Until the day before yesterday, Sima Ji, standing on the opposite bank of Gaocun, still saw beams more than one zhang long rushing down from the dam at Gaocun, which proves that the Chiang army is still constantly destroying the Gaocun dam sluice. In order to obstruct our work of transporting stones and accumulating materials, the enemy constantly used planes to bomb Qingzhuang, eight li west of Gaocun. Under the plane bombing, more than seventy houses in Qingzhuang were destroyed, and the entire property of more than twenty families was burned to ashes. Li Deyuan, a poor peasant, lost two of his four family members in the bombing, and one was injured. The masses of Qingzhuang said angrily: "We will never forget to take revenge on old Chiang, the bastard!" The democratic government immediately sent people to express condolences upon hearing the news, distributed hundreds of catties of relief grain, and sent the injured masses to the hospital for treatment.
[This report from JiluYu on the 1st] On the night of the 16th of this month, Chiang bandit special agents completely smashed the tomb hook ropes and rib ropes on the willow and stone revetments of the Kunshan section emergency works, and threw them into the river. We discovered this early the next morning and are now actively repairing them.
[This report from JiluYu on the 30th] In the second and third districts of the Fan County riverbed, there are a total of eighty-one villages, of which ten villages have completely fallen into the river. The autumn crops of the year were all flooded, and most people could not maintain their lives. According to investigations, there are 7,176 households and 27,361 people. At this time, the government lent 12 million yuan to the second and third districts, and also distributed 10,000 catties of relief grain to support the masses in production. Li ×× of Shuangmiao in the second district borrowed 240,000 yuan, and the three members of his family made tofu. After deducting food expenses, they earned 30,000 yuan in three months and raised two or three fat pigs. More than thirty people from Silun Village went out to push carts, and a small cart earned 9,600 yuan in two days. Xu Guanghai earned 3,000 yuan a day selling bean sprouts. Some also weave dustpans, sell salt, etc., and are very energetic in production.
