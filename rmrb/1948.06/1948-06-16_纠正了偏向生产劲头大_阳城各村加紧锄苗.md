　　Correcting Deviations Leads to Greater Production Enthusiasm
  　Yangcheng Villages Intensify Weeding
　　[Taiyue News] Villages in Yangcheng are intensifying weeding efforts, with some villages already starting on the second weeding. The enthusiasm for weeding this time is much greater than during the planting. This is primarily the result of correcting deviations. Once middle peasants, poor peasants, and cadres shed their anxieties, they can concentrate on weeding. Since the meeting held in Shangbaisang on May 22nd, which retrieved the confidence of fifteen well-to-do middle-peasant households, middle-peasant households, and two poor-peasant households, the entire village has been reassured. Old men, women, and children have all gone to the fields. Even workers at the sulfur kilns, in addition to their kiln duties, spare time to work in the fields. Consequently, all 1,163 mu of millet in the village have been completely weeded. Some villages are simultaneously weeding and correcting deviations. For instance, when compensating middle peasants for labor in Jiangli Village, it was stipulated that if the other party had a small labor force, they would repay the labor by weeding. This way, the seedlings were weeded and the labor was repaid. The middle peasants who had been wronged were more enthusiastic about labor when they saw genuine repayment, and they were no longer afraid of unequal mutual aid. Nearly 1,000 mu of seedlings were weeded in just four days from the 21st to the 24th. Furthermore, this year's mutual aid teams were organized after the deviations were corrected. Therefore, many mutual aid teams initially focused on voluntary participation, equal exchange, and timely accounting. For example, the mutual aid team in Hou Sanzhuang, Yinjiagou, First District, had completely weeded 421 mu of millet and 42.5 mu of cotton once, and some had begun the second weeding. The mutual aid team in Nanliangcheng Village, First District, operates on the principles of freedom of entry and exit, democratic discussion, and collective decision-making. For example, Xiao San had some disagreements last winter and was initially unwilling to participate in mutual aid, but no one forced him. He went out and worked alone for a few days. Seeing how lively and energetic the mutual aid team was, working together, singing, and laughing, he realized that it took a lot of effort to go back and forth for meals alone. He spent five days weeding only two mu of millet on the north slope, and he was worried that his illness would leave his crops unattended. The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was wrong, so he returned to the mutual aid team, and everyone welcomed him. This is true freedom of entry and exit. Additionally, accounts are diligently settled, and wages are cleared. The Yigu mutual aid team in the Fifth District settles accounts every half month, clearly recording who owes whom.

　　纠正了偏向生产劲头大
  　阳城各村加紧锄苗
    【太岳讯】阳城各村正在加紧锄苗，有些村庄已开始锄二遍。这次锄苗要比耕种时的劲头大得多。这首先是纠偏的结果。中农贫农和干部把自己的心病丢掉了，就能安心锄苗。上白桑自从五月二十二日开了个会议找回十五户富裕中农中农和两户贫农后，全村都安下心来，老汉妇女儿童全部上了地，连硫磺窑上的工人除了下窑又誊出时间来上地，所以全村一千一百六十三亩谷已全部锄完。有些村子纠偏还没搞完的，一面锄苗一面纠偏。如匠礼村在补偿中农工资时，规定了对方要是劳力少，则还工锄苗，这样苗也锄了工又还了。被侵害的中农见到真正还工，劳动劲头更大，也不怕互助不等价了。二十一日到二十四日四天里就锄了近千亩苗。另外今年的互助组，是在纠偏后组织起来的，所以不少互助组一开始就注意作到自愿结合、等价交换、按时算帐。比如一区尹家沟后三庄的互助组，已把四百二十一亩谷四十二亩半棉花完全锄了一遍，有的开始锄第二遍。一区南梁城村的互助组，是进出自由民主讨论大家决定，如小三因为去冬闹下些蹩扭，开始不愿互助，但谁也没强迫他，让他出去独自一人干了几天，看见互助组在一块干又唱又笑十分热闹，干活也有劲。从五月十九到二十五就锄了九十亩谷，自己一个人顿顿回来吃饭很费工，光北坡上的二亩谷锄了五天还没完，又想到自个病，庄稼没人管，越想越不对，又回到互助组了，大家也很欢迎。这真正是进出自由。另外勤算帐清工资。五区宜固互助组每半月算一次帐，谁长谁短帐上开清。
