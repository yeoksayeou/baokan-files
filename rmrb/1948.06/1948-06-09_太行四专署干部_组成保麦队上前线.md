　　【Taihang News】 All cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the Fourth Military Sub-district, at an emergency mobilization meeting convened by the District Committee on the 22nd of last month to protect the wheat harvest, unanimously put forward the slogan of armed forces going to the front lines to protect the masses' wheat harvest. Immediately, more than 100 people took up arms and organized four armed wheat protection work teams, which set off on the 25th to villages in the border areas of Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, and Xiuwu to protect the masses' wheat harvest.

　　【Huixian News】 The Wanxiao Elementary School in Bopi took a wheat harvest holiday on the 23rd of last month. Under the full protection of the wheat harvest and the call of the local government, the teachers and students remaining at the school felt that the wheat harvesting work in the border areas was more important than private wheat harvesting in the rear. They decided to go to the border areas to publicize the rush harvest. The method of discussion was to first understand the overall and true situation in the countryside, then analyze and study it, and determine the direction of the publicity. In addition to using mass blackboards, writing slogans, broadcasting stations, and organizing village primary school teachers, the publicity methods and forms should be combined with meal markets, rest times, individual publicity, and large and small meetings, while also taking into account the fatigue of the masses. Live with the masses, carry water for the masses when returning home from production, feed livestock, do housework, do not put on airs, do not take things from the masses indiscriminately, and do not sleep in late. After everyone's discussion, disciplines and systems were set, and a publicity team was organized, led by Comrade Li Ying, to go to the front to publicize on the 24th.

　　太行四专署干部
  　组成保麦队上前线
    【太行消息】四分区各直属机关全体干部，于上月二十二日在地委召开紧急动员保卫麦收大会上，一致提出武装奔赴前线，保卫群众麦收的口号，当即有一百余人都拿起了武器，组织四个武装保麦工作队，于二十五日出发，奔赴博爱、焦作、武陟、修武各边缘区村庄，保卫群众麦收。（四专署干训班宪谋）
    【辉县消息】薄壁完小于上月二十三日放了麦假，在全力保卫麦收和当地政府号召下，留校师生感到边沿区抢收工作比后方私人割麦重要得多，决定到边地宣传抢收。讨论办法是先了解农村全面真实情况，再分析研究，决定宣传的方针。宣传的方法方式，除用大众黑板、写标语、广播台、组织村中小学教员外，应结合饭市上，休息时间，个别的宣传和大小会宣传，同时也要照顾群众的疲劳。给群众生活在一起，生产回家给群众担水、喂牲口、做家里杂活，不摆架子，不乱拿群众东西，不睡懒觉。经过大家讨论后，定出了纪律与制度，组织了个宣传队由李英同志领着于二十四号到前边宣传去。
