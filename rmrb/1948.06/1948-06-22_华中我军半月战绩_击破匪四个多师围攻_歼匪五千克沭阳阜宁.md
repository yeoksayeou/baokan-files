Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th: After more than half a month of heroic fighting, the Central China People's Liberation Army thwarted the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "encirclement and annihilation" plot by four reorganized divisions and one rapid column. They then successively shifted to the offensive, annihilating 5,000 enemy troops and recovering many towns such as Shuyang, Funing, Qutang, and Jiangyan. In late May, Chiang bandit's Reorganized 25th Division and Reorganized 4th Division, led by Huang Botao, commander of the 25th Division, invaded from Dongtai in the north. They advanced cautiously through Shenzao, Xiaohai, and Dazhongji (all northeast of Dongtai). When they sneaked to Liuzhuang and Biancang south of Yeting (Yancheng), the People's Liberation Army rose to meet them. The Chiang bandits immediately shrank back to an area of only eight miles east-west near Biancang, stubbornly resisting. After battles on the 23rd and 24th, we killed and wounded more than 2,400 enemy troops including Yang Tingyan (wounded), the commander of the 108th Brigade of the Reorganized 25th Division, and captured more than 120 alive. On another front, the bandit troops of the Reorganized 83rd Division and Reorganized 72nd Division and the 3rd Rapid Column from Lianghuai successively occupied our cities of Shuyang and Funing on the 20th and 25th, frantically "sweeping" the Huaihai area. Gu Zhutong, seeing that his southern line was in danger, hurriedly ordered Zhang Yunzhong, director of his 7th Pacification Zone, to personally lead the 83rd Division and other units to the south to support, attempting to combine forces from north and south to "encircle and annihilate" our army south of the Sheyang River. Our army saw through their plot and quickly moved outside the encirclement. On the 31st, the Chiang bandits occupied Yeting City, but they found nothing everywhere they went, and the vast areas on their flanks and rear were facing a serious threat from our army. On the 4th and 6th of this month, the enemy in Shuyang, Funing, and other places were forced to flee in panic, and our army recovered the two cities and the vast areas such as Sangxu northeast of Shuyang. At this time, our army launched offensives against the enemy on the Hai (an), Tai (xing), Huai (yin), and Su (qian) lines simultaneously. On the Hai-Tai line, on the 7th and 8th, we successively captured strongholds such as Qutang, Daxiaobaimi, and completely annihilated more than 2,000 enemy troops guarding them, and took advantage of the victory to recover Jiangyan. Local armed forces cooperated in the battle, defeating the enemy's 434th Regiment of the Reorganized 21st Division that came to support from Tangwan (southeast of Taixian), killing and capturing more than 250. On the Huai-Su line, on the 7th, we captured strongholds such as Geji, Laianji, Shiji, and Gu Xiaoji, annihilating more than 220 enemy troops below the company commander of the Provisional 25th Division. In the above battles, preliminary statistics show that we captured three mortars, six 60mm guns, seven grenade launchers, seventy-four light and heavy machine guns, two submachine guns, more than 570 long and short guns, and a portion of ammunition and military supplies.

　　华中我军半月战绩
  　击破匪四个多师围攻
  　歼匪五千克沭阳阜宁
    【新华社华东前线十九日电】华中解放军经过半月余的英勇奋战，使蒋匪四个整编师、一个快速纵队的“合击”、“围歼”阴谋落空，并相继转取攻势，先后歼匪达五千名，收复沭阳、阜宁、曲塘、姜堰等城镇多处。五月下旬蒋匪整二十五师、整四师由二十五师师长黄伯韬率领，自东台北犯，经过沈灶、小海、大中集（均在东台东北），一路战战兢兢前进，当其窜至叶挺（盐城）南刘庄、卞仓一线时，解放军起而迎击，蒋匪顿即龟缩于卞仓附近东西仅八里之地带负隅顽抗。经二十三、二十四两日战斗，我毙伤匪整二十五师一○八旅旅长杨庭晏（伤）以下二千四百余名，生俘其一百二十余名。另路两淮匪军整八三师、整七二师及第三快速纵队于二十日、二十五日先后侵占我沭阳、阜宁两城，疯狂“扫荡”淮海地区。顾匪祝同见其南线告急，乃急令其第七绥区主任张云中亲率八三师等部南援，妄图南北合击，“围歼”我军于射阳河以南地区。我军洞识其奸，迅速转至合击圈外。三十一日蒋匪侵占叶挺城，但却处处扑空，其侧后广大地区又面临我军的严重威胁。本月四、六两日沭阳、阜宁等地之敌乃被迫仓皇逃窜，该两城及沭阳东北之桑墟等广大地区当为我军收复。此时我军即对海（安）、泰（兴）、淮（阴）、宿（迁）两线之敌同时发动攻势。海泰线上，七、八两日我连克曲塘、大小白米等据点，全歼守敌二千余名，并乘胜收复姜堰。当地地方武装配合作战，击溃自塘湾（泰县东南）出援之敌整二十一师四三四团，毙俘其二百五十余名。淮宿线上，七日我攻克葛集、来安集、史集、顾小集等据点，歼敌暂二十五师连长以下二百二十余名。以上各次战斗，初步统计共缴获迫击炮三门，六○炮六门，掷弹筒七个，轻重机枪七十四挺，冲锋枪二支，长短枪五百七十余支，弹药及军用品各一部。
