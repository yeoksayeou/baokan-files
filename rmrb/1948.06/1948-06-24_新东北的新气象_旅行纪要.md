　　New Atmosphere in the New Northeast
  　Travel Notes
    Zhu Xuefan
    During this trip, I stayed for ten days in Liujia Township, Shuanghe District, Suihua County, and then went to Jiamusi, Mudanjiang and other cities to visit the First and Second Mining Areas, as well as two power plants and more than a dozen other large and small factories, spending forty days of travel life. In the countryside, I personally saw the situation of the peasants after they turned over. Now the peasants have land, houses, and livestock. Every household also has sideline production, raising more than a dozen chickens and one or two fat pigs. The grassroots political organizations in the countryside are all run by poor and middle peasants. The district chief of the district government is also elected from the peasants. The feudal forces have been completely destroyed, and the system of people oppressing people can no longer be seen. All work in the countryside, such as land distribution, production, hygiene, education, military service, and self-defense, is the responsibility of the farmers' association. The director and members of the farmers' association are elected democratically. They all hold the spirit of "serving the people" and handle things fairly and reasonably. The director of the farmers' association is very hardworking, starting early and working late, running from the east village to the west village, but they feel very happy. Wang Yuting, the director of the Liujia Township Farmers' Association, said to me: "Now that there are no landlords to exploit us, we are all working for ourselves, so what if we are a little tired!" The peasants have a basic understanding of politics, "We must increase production to support the front line, defeat Old Chiang and defend our homeland," this is the consensus of the masses. Peasant production is organized into production teams, and any difficulties are overcome by collective strength. "In the past, production was for the landlords, now production is for ourselves. With land and livestock, what are we afraid of!" This is what a production team leader told me. Production is a central task in the Liberated Areas. When I went to the countryside, the district committee, the district chief, and the district work team were all in the township. They held a meeting every three days to report on the production situation, and they often ran to various villages to help the peasants plant wheat and deliver manure. I audited one of their reports. What they discussed was: (1) how to complete wheat planting; (2) how to complete manure delivery; (3) how to promote various production teams. The county magistrate and the county committee also went to the countryside. "We go to the countryside at any time, and we spend more time in the countryside than sitting in the county government. When we go to the countryside, we treat the common people as brothers, and we also help them with plowing. There is no difference between the county magistrate and the common people." This is what He, the county magistrate of Suihua County, said to me when I asked him about the situation in the countryside. The peasants expressed 120,000 points of satisfaction with the politics of the Liberated Areas. One peasant said to me: "The Communist Party distributed land to us and also helped us to cultivate it. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo period, the officials only oppressed us and asked us to pay He." (He means compulsory purchase at low prices). I think, in the Chiang-controlled areas, the peasants are subjected to the three levies policy (conscription, grain requisition, and purchase) and various kinds of extortionate taxes. What the peasants enjoy is only feudal exploitation. The county magistrate is a master, how could he go to the countryside to help the peasants with plowing?

    Joining the army is considered a glorious thing in the countryside. I saw dozens of young peasants joining the army in the township. They all wore flowers and rode on horses. The sound of the student Yangko team's gongs and drums shook the whole village. "It is glorious for us to join the army, to protect the country, protect the fields, and protect our homeland, and to defeat Chiang Kai-shek to avenge the people!" This is the slogan shouted by hundreds of men, women, old and young fellow villagers who came to see them off. Among them were the parents, wives, and children of the peasants who joined the army, shouting the same slogans at the top of their voices along with the procession. The peasants who joined the army rode on horses, and their faces showed the heroic spirit of killing the enemy, which moved me very much. In the Chiang-controlled areas, recruits are captured and tied up, while in the Liberated Areas, they voluntarily and enthusiastically join the army. The source of soldiers in the Liberated Areas is unlimited. After the peasants are liberated, they have turned over through land reform and have become politically conscious, realizing that it is their responsibility to defend the country and defend their homeland; at the same time, the farmers' association will solve any difficulties for the families of those who join the army, so those who join the army have no worries. Joining the stretcher team is also a very happy thing for the peasants, and they are all eager to prepare carts and livestock to go to the front line. In the Liberated Areas, one can no longer see the peasants with mourning faces in the old days. Now they are all as lively as dragons and tigers, running around in the villages and fields, busy planting wheat, cultivating large fields, repairing houses, living and working happily in an atmosphere of democracy and freedom.

    The Northeast is China's largest source of wealth, with coal, iron, and forests. Transportation in the Northeast is well-developed, with a total of 11,000 kilometers of railways, of which 10,400 kilometers are now in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. The grain is rich in soybeans and sorghum. This time when I went to Mudanjiang, I saw rice fields everywhere. When I was in Jiamusi, there was fish to eat at every meal. Where in the Northeast is not a land of fish and rice? Industry in the Northeast has the basic conditions for development. During the period of Japanese imperialism and the puppet Manchukuo, in order to satisfy their aggressive ambitions, they used the blood and sweat of our Northeast compatriots to build some industrial foundations. During the "August 15th" recovery, the Japanese bandits destroyed it again, the trains stopped running, and the factories were closed. However, the army and civilians in the Liberated Areas have repaired them in a very short time. The trains depart and arrive on time, and the coal output of the mines is even stronger than during the puppet Manchukuo period. The wheels of most light and heavy industrial factories are turning, and large-scale production is going on day and night. This is a miracle. When Zhang Jingzhi, Chairman of Mudanjiang, accompanied me to visit a factory, he told me that in 1946, he also accompanied an American to visit it. Chairman Zhang said to me: "At that time, I asked the American if this mine could be repaired. He shook his head at me and said that it would be better to rebuild a new one." Chairman Zhang continued to say to me: "But we only spent three months to repair it all." I saw that this factory was very modern and the equipment was very complete. An old worker in the machinery plant of the Second Coal Mining Area said to me: "When we recovered on August 15th, the factory buildings here were destroyed, the machines were broken, and it didn't look like a factory. When Director Liu came here, under the call of the democratic government, we all helped to repair it." Another worker surnamed Liu said to me: "Do you see that mud-walled factory building? It was all newly built by us! We pieced together two broken machines into one, and the wheels turned. The pile of scrap copper and rotten iron outside is our raw material, and we also picked out many parts to match the machines. This factory initially undertook the task of repairing the machines in the mines, and now it can manufacture gas lamps and coal carts for the mines by itself. The machines used by several mines are all taken over by this factory." This Director Liu was wearing a broken cotton-padded trousers with the cotton wool leaking out, guiding the workers in their work. In the state-owned factories in the Chiang-controlled areas, the director is a well-paid position, wearing a beautiful suit, living in a foreign house, and riding in a streamlined car. How could he wear broken trousers and share weal and woe with the workers? The total mining volume of the First Coal Mining Area exceeded the highest productivity during the puppet Manchukuo period by 40%. The First Mine I visited exceeded it by 100%. This Director Li was not born as a mining engineer, nor did he have the experience of mining coal, but now when he talked to me, he took a map and explained to me how much coal could be produced here and how many coal seams could be produced there. He was completely transformed into an experienced mining expert. He said to me: "We rely on the masses for everything. 90% of the cadres are promoted by the workers. All the pit leaders are workers. They are experienced and capable." In the power plant, the workers told me that the plant was destroyed by the enemy, and they overcame all kinds of difficulties to make the power plant shine again. I was excited and admired when I heard this. This is the greatest achievement of the comrades in the Liberated Areas in overcoming industrial difficulties, that is, the mass line, relying on the masses, humbly learning from the masses, and striving to explore, so that the laymen have also become experts, and those without specialized knowledge have also become experts. In the process of building factories and mines, there are also many amazing inventions and creations. I recall that the mines in the Chiang-controlled areas were filled with Chiang's police and gendarmes, which was so terrifying. In the Liberated Areas, I visited the First and Second Mining Areas, and I did not see a single mine guard. In the mine in the First Mining Area, I heard music and singing. Many miners who were off duty were rehearsing the opera "The White-Haired Girl". In the workers' club in the factory, you can hear the song "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China" at any time. The workers are competing to make contributions. "I want to mine more coal, add more firepower, and quickly defeat Old Chiang, so that everyone will have food to eat!" These words were said to me by a coal black (i.e., a coal miner). Now the workers in the Liberated Areas have gained political freedom and liberation. The workers in state-owned factories and mines can participate in the administrative management of the factories and mines, formulate their own production and meritorious service plans, and assess their own wage standards. The factories and mines in the Liberated Areas are the homes of the workers, and the trade unions are the schools of the workers. The people in the Liberated Areas have gained warmth, happiness, democracy, and freedom, and are happily welcoming the construction of a new democratic China.

　　新东北的新气象
  　旅行纪要
    朱学范
    这次旅行，我在绥化县双合区刘家乡住了十天，又到了佳木斯、牡丹江等城市参观了第一、第二两矿区，及两个发电厂和其他十几家大小工厂，过了四十天的旅行生活。在农村亲眼看见了农民翻身后的情况，现在农民大家有了土地、有了房子、有了牲口，每户人家还有副业生产，养了十几只鸡，一二口肥猪，农村的基层政治机构都是贫雇中农当了家，区政府的区长也都是农民里选出来的，封建势力完全摧毁了，再看不见人压迫人的制度了。一切农村里的分地、生产、卫生、教育、参军、自卫等工作，都是由农会里来负责，农会主任及委员都是用民主方式选出来的，他们都抱了“为人民服务”的精神，处理事情，都是顶公平合理的。农会主任非常辛苦，起早搭黑，东屯跑到西屯，但是他们感到十分痛快。刘家乡农会主任王玉廷对我说：“现在没有地主来压榨我们了，我们都是为自己做事，辛苦一些有啥！”农民对于政治都有了基本认识，“我们要增加生产支援前线，打垮老蒋保卫家乡”，这是大众的意见。农民生产编成了生产小组，有什么困难用集体力量来克服。“过去生产为地主，现在生产为自己，有了土地、有了牲口还怕啥！”这是一个生产小组组长对我说的。生产是解放区里一件中心工作，我下乡时候，区委、区长和区里工作队都在乡里，他们三天就要开一次会，汇报生产情形，经常在各屯奔跑，帮助农民种麦、送粪。我旁听了一次他们的汇报，他们讨论的是：（一）如何完成种麦；（二）如何完成送粪；（三）如何推动各生产小组。县长县委也都下了乡。“我们随时下乡，下乡去的时候比坐在县政府的时间多。我们下乡去和老百姓都是称兄道弟的，我们也帮助他们扶犁，县长与老百姓没有什么分别。”这是绥化县何县长回答我问下乡情形怎样的问题时说的。农民对于解放区的政治，表示十二万分满意，一个农民对我说：“共产党分了地给我们，还要帮我们来种地，从前伪满时，官家只有压迫我们，向我们要出荷。”（出荷即低价征购）我想，在蒋管区里对于农民开的是三征政策（征兵、征粮、征购）和苛捐杂税等层层压迫，农民所享受的只是封建剥削。县长是老爷，哪里肯下乡去替农民扶犁呢。
    参军在农村里认为是一件光荣的事情，我在乡里看到了几十个青年农民去参军，他们都戴了花，骑在马上，学生秧歌队锣鼓声音震动了全屯。“我们参军是光荣的，保国、保田、保家乡，打垮蒋介石为人民报仇！”这是欢送参军的几百个男女老少乡里父老们叫出来的口号。内中有参军农民的父母妻子，跟着队伍拉直了喉咙同样的叫出来。参军农民骑在马上，面部上显出英雄杀敌的神气，使我非常感动。在蒋管区里壮丁是抓来的，绑来的，解放区里则是自动的踊跃地去参军。解放区兵源是无限的，农民解放后，经过了土改翻了身，政治上有了觉悟，认识了保卫国家保卫家乡是他们的责任；同时参军家属有什么困难都由农会来替他们解决，参军的也没有后顾之忧了。参加担架队也是农民顶高兴的一件事，都很踊跃的预备了大车、牲口，要上前线去。在解放区，已看不见旧时代中哭丧着脸的农民，现在都是生龙活虎似的在屯里地里奔来奔去，在民主自由的空气中忙着种麦子、种大田，修补房子，快乐的生活和工作着。
    东北是中国的最大富源，有煤、有铁、有森林。东北的交通四通八达，共有铁路一万一千公里，现在已有一万零四百公里在人民解放军手里。粮食富有大豆、高粱。这次我到牡丹江去，看见遍野都是稻田，在佳木斯时候，每餐都有鱼吃，东北哪里不是鱼米之乡呢？工业在东北有发展的基本条件，日本帝国主义伪满时为要满足侵略野心，拿我们东北同胞的血汗建成一些工业基础，“八一五”光复时候，日寇又把它破坏了，火车停驶了，工厂也关了门了。但解放区军民在很短时间里都把它们修复起来了，火车准时开出，准时到达，矿山出煤成绩比伪满时还要强，大部轻、重工业工厂机器的轮子都在转动了，日以继夜的大生产，这是一个奇迹。牡丹江张静之主席陪我去参观一个工厂时，他告诉我，在一九四六年，他也陪过一个美国人去参观过，张主席对我说：“当时我问那个美国人，这个矿可不可以修复，他对我摇摇头，同时他说不如重建一个新的。”张主席继续对我说：“可是我们只花了三个月时间，都修起来了。”我看见这个厂非常现代化，设备都很完备。第二煤矿区机械所一个老工友对我说：“八一五光复时候，这里厂房毁了，机器坏了，不象一个工厂了。刘厂长到了这里来，在民主政府号召下，我们大家帮着修建起来了。”另外一个姓刘的工友对我说：“你看见那所泥墙壁厂房吗？都是我们新建的！我们把破机器二部拼一部，东拼西凑，轮子就转了。外面一堆破铜烂铁是我们的原料，我们还检出许多零件配上了机器。这个工厂开始担任修理矿山的机件任务，现在已经能自己制造矿山用的瓦斯灯、煤车等了，几个矿山所用的机器都由这个厂担任下来。”这位刘厂长穿了棉絮已经漏出来的破棉裤，在指导工人工作。在蒋管区公营工厂里的厂长是一个肥缺，穿的是漂亮西装，住的是洋房，坐的是流线型汽车，哪里还穿破裤子和工友同甘苦呢。第一煤矿区全区采量比伪满时最高生产率超过了百分之四十，我参观的第一矿超过了一倍。这位李矿长并不是矿师出身，同时也没有开矿刨煤的经验，但是现在他对我谈话时候，拿了一张图向我解说这里可出多少煤，那里可出多少煤层，头头是道，完全变成了一个有经验的矿业专家了。他对我说：“我们一切靠群众管理，干部百分之九十是由工人群众提拔起来的，坑长全部都是工人来当的，他们有经验，能干。”我在发电厂里工友们告诉我那个厂被敌人破坏了，他们克服了千般困难，才使这个发电厂重放光明。我听了兴奋佩服，这就是解放区工作同志克服工业上困难最大的成就，就是群众路线，依靠群众，虚心地向群众学习，努力地去摸索，外行的也变成内行了，没有专门知识的也变成专家了。在修建工厂矿山过程中，还有许多惊人的发明创造。我回想起来在蒋管区里的矿山上，满布着蒋警宪兵，多可怕啊。在解放区里我参观了第一、第二两个矿区，没有看见过一个矿警，我在第一矿区矿山里听到了音乐与歌声，许多下班的矿工正在排演“白毛女”歌剧，在工厂里工人俱乐部里，随时可以听到“没有共产党就没有中国”的歌声。工人都在竞赛着立功。“我要多刨煤，多加火力，赶快打垮老蒋，大家有饭吃！”这几句话是一个煤黑子（即挖煤工人）对我说的。现在解放区里工人得到了政治上的自由解放，公营工矿工人可以参加工矿行政管理，自己拟定生产立功计划，自己评定应得工资标准。解放区工矿是工人的家庭，工会是工人的学校，解放区人民得到温暖、愉快、民主、自由，在欢笑着迎接新民主主义的新中国的建设。
