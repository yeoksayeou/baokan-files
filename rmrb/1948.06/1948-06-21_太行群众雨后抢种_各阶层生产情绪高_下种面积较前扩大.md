　　Taihang Masses Rush to Plant After Rain
  　Production Enthusiasm High Among All Classes
  　Sown Area Larger Than Before
    [Taihang News] After a good rain fell on June 6th and 7th in over twenty counties under Taihang's jurisdiction in northern Henan and western Hebei, the masses rushed to plant while the soil was still moist. According to correspondents, in thirteen villages in counties such as Neiqiu, Xingtai, Lincheng, Shexian, and Linxian, over 12,000 mu were planted in about three days. In order to complete the planting in advance, various places universally put forward mobilizing slogans such as "Men, women, young and old, all go to the fields; livestock, plows, and seed drills are all busy," and voluntarily organized mutual aid and labor exchange to accelerate summer planting. In Jin Dazhai, Neiqiu Fifth District, 251 (full, half, and auxiliary) laborers, 52 women, 81 head of livestock, and 24 seed drills, under the active leadership of the production committee, voluntarily formed eight assault planting teams the day after the rain, all went to the fields, men planting, women helping with the seed drill, men plowing, women planting seeds, and half and auxiliary laborers pulling rollers, implementing detailed and rational division of labor. Wu Cun, the production director, personally led his mutual aid team, planting 115 mu in one and a half days with three seed drills. Wu Yunlai, chairman of the Xingtai Nangaocun Farmers' Association, finished planting his own land and helped three households without labor or livestock plant 24 mu. Because of starting early and working late, and voluntary equal-value exchange, the village planted over 1,400 mu in three days, saving over 300 workdays. Shexian, Linxian, and other places are all reaping a piece, cutting a piece, and planting a piece. In Xigang, Linxian, the whole village mobilized, women reaping, men carrying and planting, and children helping with the seed drill, completing the harvesting and planting of over 600 mu of wheat land simultaneously within four days. Many villages in Shexian interplant and spot-plant in late-maturing wheat fields. In the Sixth District, eight villages mostly completed harvesting wheat and rushing to plant at the same time. The border areas implemented a combination of labor and military affairs. The democratic governments of Qinyang and Tangyin counties allocated 40,000 jin of corn, bean, and grain seeds to solve the seed difficulties of the disaster-stricken masses. In addition, in the all-out effort to rush planting, they combined compensation for wrongly-struggled middle peasants and resettlement of landlords and rich peasants, raising the enthusiasm of all classes for rushing planting and expanding the sown area. In Sili Pu, Neiqiu Fifth District, three middle peasant households who had been wrongly struggled were compensated, and two landlord and rich peasant households were resettled, promoting the general mobilization of the whole village for rushing to plant. Men organized people to pull seed drills, and women pulled rollers, planting 900 mu in three days. Shentou, Shexian, returned 415,400 yuan of production funds that had been forcibly borrowed from 214 middle peasant households last winter. On the third day, they reorganized the mutual aid teams and vigorously rushed to plant.
