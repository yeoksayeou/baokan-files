[Chahar News] People in various areas of western Hebei, based on their local production conditions, are vigorously developing various sideline productions to overcome the famine. In Dongcun District, Fangshan First District, the practice of planting vegetables everywhere and accumulating vegetables in every household has already connected with the summer harvest. Most of the people in this district have been short of food for three months. In order to overcome the spring famine, eight villages universally planted spring vegetables, using 92.5 catties of seeds; they gathered 2,634 *shi* of tree leaves and mountain vegetables, equivalent to 792 *dou* of corn, which can solve the food problem for 1,500 people for one month. In the Fourth District of Laishui, 1,524 people collected 9,040 catties of mountain vegetables and tree leaves in five days, which, calculated at five catties of vegetables per catty of corn, is equivalent to 35,808 catties of corn. Kui Fukui and his son from Fuhe Village, Fangshan First District, have earned 2.1 million yuan (border currency, same below) since the beginning of spring by cutting mountain goods; this is enough for their family of eight to eat for three months. The North Bianqiao Village Cooperative in the Fourth District of Laishui organized 16 groups of 80 people, combining the cutting of mountain goods with farming. Each day, each group draws two or three people to cut mountain goods, while the others farm, rotating with each other. One person can earn 30,000 to 50,000 yuan a day. The masses in Huanglue Liu Village in the Fifth District of the county broke with the idea of relying on relief, organized themselves to cut mountain goods and dig medicinal materials, earning nearly 10 million yuan in three months. In Lujiazhuang, First District of Huailai, eleven households received 1.7 *shi* of loaned grain, organized two groups to cut strips and weave large baskets, earning a lot of money, thus driving the whole village. In order to solve the spring famine, the Nanhetai Village Cooperative in the First District of Changwan organized the masses to dig medicinal materials, which the cooperative purchased. More than 1,000 catties of *chaihu* have now been collected. Baoshui Village in Fangshan originally had twenty spinning wheels. In order to develop sideline occupations and increase income, twenty more have now been added. After spring sowing, 100 catties of cotton have been spun, solving the difficulty of obtaining salt. In combination with transporting grain and carrying coal, three villages in this district transported 31,000 catties, selling them for 10.85 million yuan. Dongcun transported grain and carried lump coal, earning money to buy 18.5 *shi* of rice, which can solve the lives of 490 people for one month.
