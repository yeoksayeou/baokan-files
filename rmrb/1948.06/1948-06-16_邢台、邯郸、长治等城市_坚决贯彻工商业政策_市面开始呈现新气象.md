　　Xingtai, Handan, Changzhi and Other Cities
  　Resolutely Implement Industrial and Commercial Policies
  　Markets Begin to Show a New Look
    [Comprehensive Report] Cities like Xingtai, Handan, Changzhi, Yuanshi, and Gaoping have resolutely implemented policies to protect the development of industry and commerce, correcting past mistakes. Markets have immediately shown a new look and are beginning to move towards prosperity. Business owners who fled to the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are also constantly returning to resume their businesses.
    Recently in Xingtai City, three more shop owners who had fled to other places—Tongfengyu, Dingji Medical Garden, and Gongxing Bowl Shop—returned home. The government immediately returned all their shop properties according to law. The capital of these shops increased significantly during the period the government managed them on their behalf. When Gongxing Bowl Shop fled at the end of 1946, its goods were valued at 80,000 Jichaopiao. After returning, it had increased to 1.36 million Jichaopiao. All the returned shops expressed gratitude to the government for the profits made during its management. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also convened a city-wide meeting of managers, workers, and shop assistants. After reviewing and correcting the unreasonable phenomenon of not using skills, seniority, and initiative as wage standards, they established correct wage standards based on the principle of "mutual benefit for labor and capital." Various factories and shops will subsequently expand their business. The manager of Tongjugong Iron Factory, fearing worker struggles in the past, voluntarily proposed that workers receive 70% of the profits in addition to their monthly wages (capital gets 30%, labor gets 70%). The factory was not focused on management and gradually collapsed. Since correcting the 30/70 profit sharing and determining appropriate wages, they have rented five more rooms, bought a lathe, and are actively repairing the interior to prepare for the mass production of various tools. In order to encourage the development of private industry and commerce and free trade, the municipal government issued a notice to the city to cancel the transaction fees of the five major industries of fur, medicinal materials, bamboo goods, hemp skin, and mountain goods. It was also decided to transfer and sell 20 state-owned shops and factories, valued at 12.2 million Jichaopiao, to private individuals. The Jinnan Bank branch in the city also issued a large number of loans. In addition to the 135 million Jichaopiao in loans already issued, another 77.78 million Jichaopiao has been added recently, and loan interest rates have been lowered to benefit the development of industry and commerce.
    Handan City has also returned all wrongly struggled and entrusted business firms to their original owners. Wu Shoucun, the manager of Dongxing Iron Factory, ran to Shijiazhuang when Handan was liberated. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Wu and others returned to Handan. Knowing the democratic government's policy of developing industry and commerce, they requested to resume their business. The masses and leaders returned the 3.12 million Jichaopiao in shares and furniture to them. Merchants who had previously fled to the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas and closed down their businesses have since returned to resume operations with peace of mind. By mid-May, nearly 20 businesses had resumed operations, including Xiao Jingxiang's paper dyeing workshop in Southwest Zhuanghou Street, Fusheng Store, and Huafeng Tea House in Xinhua Street. Five businesses returned from Anyang, three from Tianjin, and several from Beijing, Taiyuan and other places. Pei Guansheng, the manager of Gongshun Grain Store in Dongda Street, said after returning from Beijing: "It was very difficult to find a job there. I could only help others with some work, living like a beggar. At first, I could barely make a living, but it became increasingly difficult. It cost 100,000 yuan for one person to eat the worst food for a day, and over 1 million yuan to make the worst clothes. When I was at my wit's end, I heard people from the liberated areas going to Beijing say that the government resolutely protects industry and commerce and called for all those who had fled to return. So I came back. There are quite a few businessmen from our area in Beijing. They were mostly owners and shopkeepers in the past. Now some are pulling rickshaws, some are pulling tricycles, some are begging for food, and setting up a small stall is the best they can do. They all want to come back, but they still have some doubts. I will write a letter and ask those I know to come back."
    After thoroughly reviewing the mistake of using rural perspectives to guide urban work, the Changzhi Municipal Party Committee immediately began to correct it. It has now returned 14 factories, workshops, and shops. A portion of the industrial and commercial investments, dividends, and wages of landlords and rich peasants, totaling over 4 million Jichaopiao and 34 shi of rice, has also been returned. The rest will be returned immediately after settlement. Citizens are collectively buying city houses and opening shops. Three new shops have opened on Xiadong Street in the city, increasing capital by more than 3.4 million yuan. After dispelling fears of struggle, Baoyuan Pharmacy not only retained its original capital of more than 20 million yuan but also recently absorbed more than 10 million yuan in shares to expand its business. It has profited more than 6 million yuan in the past month.
    After the liberation of Yuanshi County, the failure to correctly implement the Party's industrial and commercial policies affected the prosperity of the market. The County Committee reviewed its mistakes and immediately returned the wrongly confiscated Chunhetang Pharmacy to its original owner. Subsequently, each village also returned all the shops operated by landlords and rich peasants in the city. In less than half a month, sixteen fugitive merchants returned to take over their original businesses. The returned workshops and shops quickly resumed operations, and the seven shops that had been closed also resumed operations one after another. The number of newly opened shops also increased greatly. In April alone, there were 53 new shops and workshops. There are now 401 industrial and commercial establishments in the city. Many shops have taken out the goods buried underground for sale, repaired their storefronts, and requested loans to expand their business. The previously vacant city houses are now being rented in competition. The whole city has a new look.
    The masses in Gaoping Chengguan returned goods and furniture worth more than 2 million Jichaopiao from the wrongly struggled Tianxingcheng Department Store. The state-owned Jinda Inn was transferred to private management to support mass production. All the shops have put out the goods they had buried in the past, and more people are going out to purchase goods. Some shops are repairing their storefronts and making big signs to prepare for a major undertaking, while others are looking for storefronts, preparing to open new shops. The streets are more lively than before.

　　邢台、邯郸、长治等城市
  　坚决贯彻工商业政策
  　市面开始呈现新气象
    【综合报导】邢台、邯郸、长治、元氏、高平等城市坚决贯彻保护工商业发展工商业的政策，纠正了过去的错误，市面立即出现新的气象，开始走向繁荣的道路，逃亡蒋区的商号主人也都不断归来复业。
    邢台市最近又有同丰玉、鼎记医园、公兴碗店等三家逃往他地的商店主回家，政府当即依法将其商店财产全部归还。这些商店在政府代为经营期间比原来资金增加很大，公兴碗店四六年底逃亡时有货物值价冀钞八万元，返柜后已增到冀钞一百三十六万元；各被归还商店均对政府代为经营得利表示感谢。市工商局亦召开了全市经理、工人、店员大会，检讨纠正过去不以技术，年限，积极等为工资标准的不合理现象后，依据“劳资两利”原则确定了正确的工资标准，各工厂商店今后相继扩大营业。同聚公铁工厂经理过去因怕工人斗争，即自动提出工人每月除应领工资外，营利已倒三七分红（资三、劳七），厂方无心经营，工厂逐渐垮台。自纠正倒三七分红，确定了适当工资后，又租下房子五间，买下镟床一架，并积极修整内部准备大量制造各种工具。市府为鼓励发展私人工商业，广泛自由交易，特布告全市取消过去皮毛、药材、竹货、麻皮、山货五大行的交易手续费，并决定将值价冀钞一千二百二十万元的二十家公营商店、工厂转让出售给私人经营。该市冀南银行支行也发放了大量贷款，除前次已发放了贷款冀冀钞一万万三千五百余万元外，近又增放七千七百八十余万元，并降低贷款利息，以利工商业的发展。
    邯郸市也已将斗错的及代管的商号都退还原主。东兴铁工厂经理武守存等在邯郸解放时跑到石家庄，石家庄解放后武等又回邯郸，知道了民主政府发展工商业的政策，要求复业，群众和领导上就把股款冀钞三百一十二万元和家具退还了他们。以前逃亡蒋区和关门歇业的商人，从此都回来重新安心经营，至五月中旬，复业的已有西南庄后街萧景祥染纸坊、福生号、新华街华丰茶庄等近二十家，从安阳回来的五家，从天津回来的三家、从北平、太原等地回来的若干家。东大街公顺粮行经理裴观生从北平回来说：“到了那里，职业很难找到，只有帮人家干点活，象讨饭的一样过日子，最初还勉强能过活，越来就越逼得人没法过，一天一个人吃最坏的饭也得十万元，做一件最赖的衣服得一百多万元。正在没法，听到从解放区去北平的人说政府坚决保护工商业，并且叫逃亡户都回去，我就回来了。咱这一带的商人在北平的还不少，他们以前大都是东家掌柜的，现在有拉排车的，有拉三轮车的，有要饭吃的，摆个小摊就是顶有办法的，他们都想回来，可是又有些怀疑；我要写信去叫我认识那些人都回来。”
    长治市市委彻底检查了以农村观点指导城市工作的错误之后，立即着手纠正，现已退还了工厂、作坊、商店十四家，地主富农的一部工商业投资、红利及工资共计冀钞四百余万元及米三十四石亦已退还。其余，俟结算好后也将立即退还。市民都在集股买市房开商店，该市下东街也已新开商店三家增加资本三百四十余万元。保元药店解除了怕斗思想后，除原有资金两千余万元外，近又吸收了千余万元股金，扩大营业，最近一个月即获利六百余万元。
    元氏县城解放后，由于没有正确的执行党的工商业政策，因而影响了市场繁荣，县委会检讨错误并当即将错没收的大药铺春和堂退还原主后，接着各村也将地主富农在城内经营的商店全部退还，不到半月，又有了十六家逃亡商号回来接收原业。退还的作坊商店都迅速复业，已经停业的七家商店也相继复业。新开商店也大大增加，仅四月份新增商店、作坊就有五十三家。现全城工商业已达四百零一家。很多商店将埋藏于地下的货物取出出售，并修建门面，要求贷款扩大营业，过去空闲的市屋，现在都是相争租赁，全城面貌一新。
    高平城关群众退还了错斗的天兴成百货庄价值冀钞二百余万的货物、家具；公营晋大客栈为了扶植群众生产，转让私人经营。各商号就都把过去埋藏的货物又摆了出来，到外边办货的人也多了，有的商店在修理门面做大招牌准备大干，还有些人在找门面，准备开新的商店，街上比以前热闹多了。
