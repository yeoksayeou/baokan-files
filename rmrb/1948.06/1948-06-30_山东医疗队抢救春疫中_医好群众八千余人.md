Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th. The Shandong Provincial Government Medical Team, in its efforts to rescue people from the spring disease outbreaks in Cangshan (newly established county, south of Linyi), Zhao＠ (newly established county, north of Pizhou), Lushui (newly established county, east of Tengxian), Pizhou County, and Lincheng (formerly Lincheng Town), has, after three months of effort, largely eradicated the prevalent diseases such as smallpox and relapsing fever in various locations. The team also penetrated enemy territory, combining medical efforts with political offensives to disintegrate enemy puppet forces. Over the past three months, the team has treated 273 villages, curing 8,735 sick people and vaccinating 25,173 people against smallpox. Among the aforementioned counties, Cangshan County suffered the most severe disease outbreaks. In mid-May, smallpox and relapsing fever spread throughout the county, and the team dispatched members to various districts for round-the-clock rescue efforts. In the border areas, under the slogan of "treating the sick while defending against the enemy," they carried out rescue work with urgency. The Li Qintang group once infiltrated an area eight li away from the enemy west of Lincheng at night to provide medical treatment for one night, treating twelve people. The team also provided medical treatment to the families of sick "Homecoming Legions" (Kuomintang militia), which led to more than twenty "Homecoming Legion" members returning in Shujia Guanzhuang alone. By late April, the disease outbreaks in most areas had been largely suppressed. The team then focused on Cangshan as the key area, re-examining and treating the effects for twenty-four days, and has now victoriously returned to the province.

　　山东医疗队抢救春疫中
  　医好群众八千余人
    【新华社华东二十八日电】山东省政府医疗大队在鲁南之苍山（新设县，在临沂以南）、赵＠（新设县，在邳县北）、麓水（新设县，在滕县东）、邳县、临城（临城镇改设）等县抢救春季病灾，经三个月努力，各地天花、回归热等流行性病疫已告扑灭。该队并挺入敌区，结合政治攻势，瓦解敌伪。三个月来共治疗过二百七十三个村庄，医好患病群众八千七百三十五人，施种牛痘二万五千一百七十三人。上述各县中以苍山县病灾最重，上月中旬天花、回归热蔓延全县，该队乃分赴各区日夜抢救。在边沿区则在一面医病，一面防敌的口号下，紧张地进行抢救。李勤堂组曾于夜间插入临城西面一带距敌八里处抢治一夜，医治了十二人。该队并给患病的“还乡团”家属医治，因此，仅舒家官庄一处即争取二十多个“还乡团”归来。至四月下旬，各地病灾大部扑灭，该队又以苍山为重点，复查医治效果，历时二十四天，现已胜利返省。
