Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: A unit of the Second Military Sub-district's armed forces of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, when advancing into the Ikhao League in southern Sui in April, the sub-district leaders issued a political order, strictly restricting the troops to respect and protect the interests of the Mongolian people. In addition to requiring all troops to abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention promulgated by the General Headquarters of the Liberation Army, the order also stipulated five special disciplines for entering Mongolian areas, the contents of which are: (1) Under no circumstances shall insulting words be spoken to Mongolian people. (2) Absolutely protect the private property of Mongolian people and not infringe upon it in the slightest. (3) Do not enter Lama temples casually, and strictly protect the buildings and scriptures inside the temples. (4) Respect the customs and habits of the Mongolian people: (1) It is forbidden to urinate or tether horses on the Mani red poles (Mongolian people erect a pole in their yards, and wealthy people erect a three-pronged steel fork. Legend has it that this was Genghis Khan's weapon, and the Mongolian people respect it as a god, calling it the Mani red pole). (2) Stop defecating or urinating inside Mongolian courtyards. (3) It is forbidden to tether livestock to cattle and sheep pens, doors, or windows. (4) It is forbidden to bring whips, sticks, or ropes into Mongolian dwellings. (5) It is forbidden to enter Mongolian sickrooms and maternity rooms (houses where children have been born). (6) It is forbidden to enter Mongolian shrines. (5) Borrowing items must be with the permission of the Mongolian people and returned responsibly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd: The Jungar Banner Lama Temple, the largest of the seven banners in the Ikhao League in southern Sui, has become increasingly desolate under Fu Zuoyi's brutal rule. Five years ago, the temple had more than a thousand lamas, but now there are only three hundred left. Many lamas have been forced to take off their cassocks, some have returned to secular life, some have fled, and some have wandered away due to the pressure of life. After the armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia entered the area on the night of April 19, they strictly respected the customs and habits of the Mongolian people and did not commit any offenses against the temple. Before our army transferred, the 79-year-old Grand Lama Jie Ke Lin Qing constantly praised our strict discipline. He said: "Fu's army moved in without even saying hello, unlike you (the Liberation Army), who negotiated last night, forcing our brothers to catch a cold in the wild. You even brought your own food, but Fu's army forced us to give them supplies, and if we couldn't, they would beat and scold us. Even I, at my age, was beaten once. You pay us for the firewood you burn, but Fu's army used to come here and tear down a row of meditation rooms outside the courtyard to burn. Your actions are all orderly and honest. To tell you the truth, I think your army is the best in the world."

　　绥南我军颁发政治训令
    保护蒙民利益
  　准噶尔旗喇嘛称赞我军纪律
    【新华社西北二日电】陕甘宁边区二军分区武装一部，于四月间挺进绥南伊克昭盟时，分区首长特发布政治训令一件，严格约束部队尊重并保护蒙民利益。训令除责成各部队遵守解放军总部颁布之三大纪律八项注意外，并定出进入蒙区之特别纪律五项，其内容为：（一）在任何情况下，不得对蒙民讲任何侮辱话。（二）绝对保护蒙民私人财产不得有丝毫侵犯。（三）不准随便进入喇嘛庙，对庙内建立及经卷应严格保护。（四）尊重蒙民风俗习惯：（１）禁止在马尼红杆子（按蒙民院子里都竖有一根杆子，有钱人则竖一支三股钢叉，传说这是当年成吉思汉的武器，蒙人把它敬如神明，称为马尼红杆子。）上小便或拴马。（２）停止在蒙民院内大小便。（３）禁止在牛羊圈及门窗上拴牲口。（４）禁止将马鞭、棍棒、绳索拿进蒙民住室。（５）禁止进入蒙民的病房和月房（生了小孩的房子）。（６）禁止进入蒙民的神堂。（五）借物必须经过蒙民许可并负责送还。
    【新华社西北二日电】绥南伊克昭盟七个旗中最大的准噶尔旗喇嘛庙，在傅作义虐政统治下日趋冷落。五年前该庙有一千多喇嘛，现在只剩三百多了，许多喇嘛被迫脱掉袈裟，有的还俗，有的逃丁，有的为生活所迫外出流浪。四月十九日夜，陕甘宁二分区武装进入该地后，严格尊重蒙民风俗习惯，对该庙秋毫无犯。我军转移前，该院七十九岁的大喇嘛介克林清，不断称赞我纪律严明，他说：“傅军一来不打招呼就住下了，不象你们（解放军）昨夜来那样办交涉，累得弟兄们在野地受凉，你们来还自己带了粮食，但傅军却是向我们逼要，办不到，便是打骂，连我这么大年纪有一次也挨了一顿打，你们来烧了柴草给我们付钱，但傅军以前来这里把院外的一排禅房都给拆掉烧了，你们行动都是规规矩矩、说实话我看天下的军队数你们好。”
