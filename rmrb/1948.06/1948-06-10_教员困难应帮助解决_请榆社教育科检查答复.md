　　Teachers' Difficulties Should Be Helped to Solve
  　Please Yushe Education Section Investigate and Reply

　　The Taoyang School District of the Third District of Yushe held a school district meeting on May 23. After reviewing the work, many problems were discovered. For example, Yue Xianying, a teacher from Jinzang, said: "Since I arrived at my post, there hasn't even been any furniture for storing rice in the school. In particular, I'm being used as a laborer. When grinding wheat for the front line, I was given fifty catties of wheat, but there was nowhere to put it, and the mice ate a lot of it. The village cadres even said I would have to pay for what was lost. There are no children in school every day, and the village cadres don't help to mobilize them. They don't even notify me to attend village cadre meetings, which makes me often want to leave my job." Shi Xiangqing, a teacher from Heping, said: "I don't have rice to eat. I borrow three sheng here and two sheng there. I owe the cooperative more than one shi of rice, and I can't pay it back. I don't even dare to go and buy things anymore." Yue Yuliang, a teacher from Qiaojiagou, said: "There's no fuel to burn every day, and the village doesn't care." Another very bad phenomenon is that young people come to the school and fight randomly, and the teachers don't dare to offer any opinions. This is the case in Heping and Qiaojiagou. When teachers offer opinions to those who are fighting, they go out and say that the teacher's attitude is bad and that they are not uniting people. If they don't offer any opinions, they turn the school into a fighting arena. Because of this, the teachers have developed a reluctance to work, feeling that it's difficult to be a teacher and wanting to leave their jobs. The higher-ups don't care, and they become like children without mothers. The higher-ups often mention strengthening education and improving children's cultural level, but how can we strengthen education and improve cultural level with the above situations? We suggest that the leadership should personally conduct in-depth inspections, solve the practical difficulties of the teachers, think of more ways for the teachers, and help them strengthen education work.

　　教员困难应帮助解决
  　请榆社教育科检查答复
    榆社三区桃阳学区五月二十三号召开学区会议，检讨工作发现了许多问题，如金藏教员岳先英说：“我自到了岗位上，学校里连个放米的家具也没有，特别是把我当成个民夫使用，给前线磨麦子时，给我配了五十斤麦子没有放处，让老鼠吃了许多，村干部还说短下了包赔。学校里每天没有儿童，村干也不帮助动员，开村干部会也不通知参加，弄得我常想离开工作”。和平教员石相卿说：“没米吃，这里三升，那里二升借的吃，短合作社一石多米，也还不了，咱也不敢再去买东西了。”乔家沟教员岳玉良说：“每天没烧的，村里也不管。”还有一个最不好的现象，是青年们到了学校里乱打，教员也不敢给提意见，和平、乔家沟就是这样，教员给打架的人们提意见，他们出去反映说教员态度不好，不团结人；不给提吧，把学校弄成个打架场了。由于这样教员们产生了一个不愿干的思想，觉得当教员难当，想离开工作，上级不管，成了没娘孩子。上级常提到加强教育工作，提高儿童文化程度，象以上情况怎能加强教育工作，怎能提高文化程度呢？我们建议领导上，应亲自深入检查，给教员同志们解决实际困难，给教员同志们多想办法，帮助他们加强教育工作。（张博益、乔明）
