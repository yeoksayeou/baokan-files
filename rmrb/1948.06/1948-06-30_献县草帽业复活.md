　　[JiZhong News] The straw hat industry in Shanglin Town, Xian County, was very developed before the war. Before the war, there were more than 70 households weaving straw hats in the town. The town had a total of 156 hat-weaving machines, producing 500 dozens of straw hats per day. In the seven months of winter and spring each year, it could produce 90,000 hats. Merchants from Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangdong, Hunan, and Fujian would come to order goods every year. With Shanglin Town as the center, hundreds of villages within a radius of 30 miles to the north and south and about 50 miles to the east and west, a large number of women participated in the production of hat braids. At its most prosperous, it produced 800,000 catties per year, which, in addition to supplying local hat workshops, was also transported to Tianjin for sale to foreign merchants. After the July 7th Incident, the hat industry suffered from various extortions and sabotage by the Japanese puppet regime, and traffic was blocked, causing almost a complete standstill. The hat braiding industry of rural women also collapsed. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the democratic government began to support the restoration of the hat industry in 1946. In that year, only a few machines were operating, and the output was very small. In 1947, the number of hat workshops increased to five, with 32 machines, producing 75 dozens per day, which were sold in various border areas. However, because the organization was too late, it did not form a mass movement, and coupled with the lack of funds, it was suspended after only one month. This spring, the masses were very eager to restore the straw hat industry, and the local democratic government helped to organize four straw hat workshops, with 57 households in the town joining as shareholders. A total of 68.05 million yuan (border currency, same below) was raised in shares. The government also provided a loan of 156 million yuan to actively support the industry. Thirty-six of the original machines were patched up (some were broken in the past), and 31 are now in operation. Most of the hat workshops adopt a profit-sharing system, with a 40/60 split between labor shares and money shares. The staff of the hat workshops do not earn wages, but share 40% of the net profit, and the shareholders share 60% of the net profit. Since the start of work in March this year, more than 5,120 dozens of hats have been produced, and sales have been rapid, with a net profit of 100.04 million yuan. With the restoration of the hat workshops, the sideline occupation of women's braiding has also become active. The hat workshops buy 8 million yuan worth of braids every day, and the women earn about 720 million yuan in three months. A woman in Beisong Village earned 50 yuan just by selling braids to one hat workshop, which is equivalent to 60,000 yuan in border currency. A woman in Nanzhuang Village braids three braids a day and can earn four and a half catties of rice. They are all happy and say, "Now we have a way to get money for clothes and spending money." Now that the season for weaving straw hats has passed, the hat workshops are planning to use existing machinery and funds to switch to making leather hats.

　　献县草帽业复活
    【冀中讯】献县商林镇草帽业，事变前非常发达。该镇事变前织草帽的有七十多户。全镇共有织帽机一百五十六盘，日出草帽五百打。每年冬春两季的七个月内，能产草帽九万顶。天津、北平、汉口、上海、青岛及两广、湖南、福建等地，每年都有帽商来此订货。以商林镇为中心，南北各三十余里、东西约五十里范围内的数百村庄，广大妇女都参加帽辫生产，最繁荣时，年产八十万斤，除供给本地帽庄外，并且运至天津供销外商。七七事变后，帽业遭受日伪多方勒索破坏，交通又被封锁几乎全部停顿；乡村妇女的帽辫业也垮了台。日寇投降后，民主政府在一九四六年便开始扶助帽业复业，那年只有几个机子活动，出货很少。一九四七年帽庄发展到五家，有机子三十二盘，日产七十五打，行销于边区各地。但因组织太晚，没有形成群众性，加以资金又少，只作了一个多月又陷于停顿。今年春天，群众对恢复草帽业的要求很迫切，当地民主政府便帮助组织了四个草帽庄，全镇有五七户入了股。共积股金六千八百零五万元（边币，下同）。政府又贷款一万五千六百万元积极扶植，原来的机子凑合了三十六架（过去存着有的坏了），现已有三十一架活动起来。各帽庄多采用分红制，人股和钱股四六分，帽庄职员不挣工资，伙分纯利的四成，股东分纯利的六成。自今年三月份开工，到现在已出货五千一百二十余打，销售很快，已得纯利一亿零四百万元。帽庄恢复了，妇女的编辫副业也活跃了帽庄，平均每天买八百万元辫子，她们三个月约得七亿二千元。北宋村一个妇女光卖给一个帽庄的辫子就有五十块，合边币六万元。南庄一个妇女每天编辫三块，能挣米四斤半。他们都高兴的说：“今后穿衣服零花钱有了办法了”。现编草帽季节已过，各帽庄正计划使用现有机器和资金，转为做皮帽子。
