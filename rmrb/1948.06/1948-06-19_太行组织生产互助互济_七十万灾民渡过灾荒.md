Taihang Organizes Production for Mutual Aid and Relief
700,000 Disaster Victims Overcome Famine
[Taihang News] Thanks to the government's full-scale relief efforts and the organization of disaster victims for self-salvation through production, the 700,000 disaster victims in the Taihang area have successfully overcome the spring famine and completed spring plowing and sowing. They are now rushing to harvest wheat and sow autumn seedlings. Seventeen border counties in the area, including Yuanshi, Pindin, Shouyang, Taigu, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Anyang, and Qixian, experienced severe spring famine due to poor autumn harvests and continuous looting by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops. According to incomplete statistics, the number of disaster victims reached 700,000. Overcoming the famine has become the most urgent task in the disaster area. In order to organize disaster victims for production and solve their immediate livelihood and production difficulties, the Taihang Administrative Office distributed 3.73 million catties of relief grain this spring and loans of 162.9 million yuan (Jicha). At the end of the lunar January, instructions were issued to all special districts, counties, and cities on providing relief for the spring famine and organizing disaster victims for production. Shouyang, Pindin, Yuanshi and other places organized production and disaster relief committees from top to bottom to organize disaster victims for self-salvation through production. After receiving relief and resolving the difficulties of living materials and production capital, the disaster victims launched transportation, peddling, digging medicinal herbs, boiling saltpeter, textile and other industrial and mining, handicraft production, and water conservancy and road construction movements in exchange for relief. When organizing disaster victims for production, all localities paid attention to the local production characteristics and conditions, and achieved great results. Under the slogan of "Textile to Overcome Famine", a large number of women in Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, Lincheng and other counties have profited from the sale of native cloth in the market from March to the present. Excluding these profits, the trade company alone purchased two million catties, earning six million catties of rice. Pindin and other industrial and mining areas, with the help of the government, developed industry and mining to overcome the famine. In Pindin County alone, the number of raw and cooked iron furnaces, coal kilns, and iron ore kilns increased from 52 to 236. Many places carried out large-scale transportation, which also brought considerable profits. Disaster victims in Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, Pindin, Yuanshi, and Xiyang counties, some of whom persisted in spring plowing and some in transportation, earned a total of 157.7 million yuan and more than 1.4 million catties and 545 dan of rice. Other production activities such as boiling saltpeter, digging medicinal herbs, and various handicrafts and small businesses played a significant role in overcoming the famine. In addition, the government allocated three million catties of rice for work relief, using disaster victims to build roads and dig canals in a planned and organized manner. In Qixian County, 2,000 disaster victims dug a 30-li-long canal in 20 days, which can irrigate 28,000 mu of land. At a daily wage of five catties of rice per person, they can earn a total of 200,000 catties of rice in 20 days. Along the Qin River in northern Henan, work relief was also used to repair rivers and build dikes, so that disaster victims could receive assistance. Under the slogan of "Farmers All Over the World are One Family", the vast masses in disaster and non-disaster areas launched mutual rescue and relief and fundraising campaigns. Gao Yi and Xingtai counties alone raised more than 800,000 catties of bran. One district in Shouyang mutually lent more than 100 dan of grain. Cadres at all levels also carried out savings under the slogan of "Sharing Hardships with Disaster Victims", reducing their living standards. In just over a month, the military region and administrative office level directly affiliated units saved 14,000 catties of millet. In Xiuwu County, each person in each organ saved six liang of millet per day. The Hong County organ cadres organized land reclamation and vegetable planting to reduce the burden on the masses.

　　太行组织生产互助互济
  　七十万灾民渡过灾荒
    【太行讯】太行区七十万灾民，经过政府全力救济及灾民组织起来生产自救，已胜利渡过春荒，完成春耕下种，现在突击麦收、播种秋苗。该区元氏、平定、寿阳、太谷、修武、武陟、安阳、淇县等十七个边沿县份，由于去秋歉收及蒋阎匪军不断抢劫，造成了严重的春荒。据不完全统计，灾民共达七十万人。战胜灾荒成了灾区当前最紧急的任务。太行行署为组织灾民生产，解决灾民眼下的生活困难和生产困难，曾于今春发放了救济粮三百七十三万斤，贷款十六万万两千九百万元（冀钞，下同），并于旧历正月底向各专、县、市发出救济春荒与组织灾民生产的指示。寿阳、平定、元氏等地均自上而下的组织了生产救灾委员会，组织灾民生产自救。灾民得到救济，解决了生活资料与生产资本的困难后，即展开了运输、小贩、刨药材、熬硝、纺织及其他工矿、手工业生产，和以工代赈的水利、筑路等运动。各地组织灾民生产时，均注意了当地的生产特点与条件，成绩颇大。元氏、赞皇、内邱、临城等县广大妇女在“纺织渡荒”的口号下，从三月到现在，除在市场上出售的土布获利不计外，只贸易公司所收买的二百万斤，即赚米六百万斤。工矿区的平定等地则在政府帮助下，发展了工矿业，渡过了灾荒。仅平定一县的生熟铁炉、煤窑、铁矿窑即由五十二座增加到二百三十六座。不少地方大规模进行运输，获利也大。榆次、太谷、寿阳、平定、元氏、昔阳等六县灾民，一部坚持春耕，一部运输，共赚洋一万万五千七百万元，赚米一百四十余万斤又五百四十五石。其他如熬硝、刨药材及各种手工业、小商贩等生产，均在渡荒中起了很大作用。此外政府拨发了三百万斤以工代赈米，有计划有组织的用灾民筑路开渠。淇县有两千灾民在二十天中挖筑了三十里长的一道渠，可浇地两万八千亩。每人每日工资米以五斤计，二十天共可赚米二十万斤。豫北沁河沿岸也以工代赈修河筑堤，使灾民得到接济。灾区与非灾区广大群众在“天下农民是一家”的口号下，发动了互救互济及募捐运动。仅高邑、邢台两县即募糠八十余万斤。寿阳一个区互借粮食百余石。各级机关干部也在“兴灾民共甘苦”的口号下进行节约，降低生活水平，月余来仅军区行署级直属单位即节省小米一万四千斤。修武县各机关每人每天节约小米六两，洪县机关干部组织开荒种菜，以减轻群众负担。
