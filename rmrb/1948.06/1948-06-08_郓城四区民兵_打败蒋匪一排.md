(2) On May 18th, a platoon of the Kuomintang 5th Division went to Guozhuang in the Fourth District of Yuncheng to loot grain. The militia of our Fourth District immediately launched an attack upon hearing the news. After entering the battle, the militia launched a fierce charge against the enemy. In just ten minutes, they charged into Guozhuang. Seeing the situation was bad, the Kuomintang bandits fled in panic. We pursued the enemy for six or seven li, and the enemy was utterly routed, abandoning all the materials they had looted from the masses. We captured one enemy soldier and wounded three. (3) On May 11th, a platoon of the remnants of the Kuomintang 55th Division went to Dachuankou in Linze Third District of Yuncheng to loot grain and conscript men. Upon hearing this, the Wu Gong [work team] of Linze Third District immediately set out to strike the enemy. After an hour of fierce fighting, one Kuomintang platoon leader and two squad leaders were killed, one enemy soldier was captured, and one Chiang Kai-shek type rifle and more than 100 rounds of ammunition were seized.
