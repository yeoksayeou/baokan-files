　　Our Army's Unit Emerges with Forty-Four Iron Leg Squads in the Zhengtai-Pingsui Campaign
　　[This Newspaper News] In the recent Pingsui and Zhengtai campaigns, one of our army's units produced forty-four "Iron Leg Squads." In large-scale mobile warfare, in order to ensure the completion of combat missions, the unit specifically proposed the slogan "Create Iron Leg Squads," with the following conditions: In three consecutive marches with tasks, first, be able to persevere and help each other, not lose contact, and not fall behind; second, not be afraid of night marches, not be afraid of climbing mountains, not be afraid of hardship or fatigue; third, no matter where you go to perform tasks, have high morale; fourth, cultural and recreational work is active during the march. After the slogan was put forward, all commanders and fighters responded enthusiastically. The Third Squad of the Fourth Company climbed high mountains and crossed large rivers during the nine-day forced march south to the Zhengtai Front. At most, they traveled one hundred and twenty li in a day, but their morale remained high. Whenever they were most tired when climbing mountains, many activists came out to call out, "Strive for the Iron Leg Squad!" Immediately, a new atmosphere appeared in the ranks, snatching each other's packs, and songs and cheers resounded through the valleys. Many soldiers had blisters on their feet that turned into pus, but they still followed the team closely. Wang Yushan, the cook of the Ninth Company, had sores on his thighs, but he didn't say anything and still carried a large pot. In the last few days, when others found out and wanted him to rest, he refused, saying, "I want to strive for the Iron Leg Squad." Wang Yongli, a young bugler from the Fifth Company, carried sick soldiers across the river eight times in order to strive for the Iron Leg Squad. The cooking squad of the Fourth Company, with only five people, had three who were sick and had blisters on their feet. In order to strive for the glorious title of Iron Leg Squad, Li Zaosheng carried a large pot and walked seventy li in one go. Squad leader Xin Shuke's feet were so swollen that they were about to burst, but he leaned on a stick and followed the team closely to the campsite, and also cut vegetables and cooked. Not only did they not fall behind, but they also ensured that the troops ate on time, without eating raw rice or sandy rice. In the recent summary of the unit, forty-four squads were awarded Iron Leg Squad certificates and called on them to continue their efforts to strive for Iron Leg Platoons and Iron Leg Companies.
