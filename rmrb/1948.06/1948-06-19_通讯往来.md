    Regarding the current reporting policy, please conduct reporting based on the points indicated in the inaugural editorial (acting as inaugural speech) of this newspaper. The reporting on unity and production in the article is currently the focus of the reporting task. Please focus on reflecting the restoration and development of agricultural production, the production sentiments of people of all classes (including rich peasants, enlightened gentry, and landlords who have been allocated land and are willing to engage in production), how various places are entering production and organizing mutual aid and labor exchange? Introduce the experience of promoting production and mutual aid and labor exchange; please also vigorously organize reports on industrial production and urban industry and commerce. The restoration and development of industry and handicrafts in various places, the actual situation of labor-capital cooperation and increased production after the implementation of new management and operation methods in various factories, can all be selected as key points for specific reporting. In addition, regarding the experience of Party consolidation and democracy, focus on systematic and complete typical materials; the guerrilla warfare in the border areas and the ongoing struggle against the enemy to protect wheat and grain must be reported regularly and continuously.
