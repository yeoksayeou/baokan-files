Raise Vigilance!
  Yan's Bandits Use Japanese Robbers to Plunder the People
  Daoping Paralyzed by Complacency Suffers Great Losses
    [Shouyang News] On May 28th, parts of the 8th and 10th columns of Yan's bandit troops in Yuci City, colluded with more than 500 Japanese soldiers, totaling over 1,000 men, and invaded Daoping Village in our Second District from Yuci City. They stayed in the panic-stricken Daoping overnight and then fled back to their original lair in a sorry state the next day. In the course of more than a day, Daoping suffered heavy losses. The enemy looted 51 shi of grain, 187 jin of various flours, 84 jin of sesame oil, 175 jin of sea salt, 28 zhang of cloth, 32 jin of cotton, 28 jin of thread, and many cotton clothes, fur coats, lined garments, bundles, quilts, mats, shovels, hoes, sickles, knives, etc.; 173 chickens, 5 pigs, and 145 sheep were taken away; two shepherds were captured. Five households were completely looted by the enemy, left with nothing. This enemy attack had three characteristics:

    1. The enemy’s raid was a desperate struggle, and the destruction was very great. It was not only about looting grain and conscripting soldiers, but also about destroying all the farmers' tools to create famine. They trampled 24 mu of seedlings along the way, and not only looted grain, but also looted broken felts and mats.

    2. Coordinating with special agent activities, there was reconnaissance in advance. Before the troops arrived, special agents placed a red strip every one or two li along the road. The enemy followed wherever there was a red strip. During the march, they showed timidity, fearing annihilation.

    3. Instead of operating in the border areas first, they launched a long-distance sneak attack on our hinterland. Daoping is more than 50 li away from Yuci City, so it was thought to be safe. Intelligence was not timely, and sentry posts were not sound. Only when the enemy arrived did we know they were coming. Only Comrade Zhao Aiyang, director of the Armed Committee, pressed two landmines, killing and wounding three enemies. The Second District Office has sent cadres to Daoping to restore morale, educate the masses with the actual situation of this war, increase the masses' hatred of the enemy, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, consolidate the organization, and arm to protect the wheat harvest.

　　提高警惕！
  　阎匪利用日寇抢劫人民
  　道坪麻痹轻敌吃了大亏
    【寿阳消息】五月廿八日，榆次城阎匪军八、十两纵队各一部，纠合日军五百余人，共千余名，由榆次城向我二区道坪村进犯；在道坪恐慌不安的住了一夜，第二天即狼狈窜回原巢。经一天多时间，道坪所受损失很大，被敌抢去粮食五十一石，各种面一百八十七斤，麻油八十四斤，海盐一百七十五斤，布二十八丈，棉花三十二斤，线二十八斤，棉衣、皮袄、单袷衣、包袱、被子、席子、锹、＠、锄、刀等甚多；鸡一百七十三只、猪五口、羊一百四十五只；捉去羊工二人，有五户被敌一抢而光，要甚没甚。这次敌人进攻，有三个特点：
    一、敌人是绝望挣扎性的奔袭出扰，破坏性非常大。不仅是抢粮、抓丁，而且摧毁农民一切用具，制造灾荒。一路＠踏青苗廿四亩，不但抢粮，破毡破席都要抢光。
    二、配合特务活动，事先有侦察，人未到前即有特务沿路每隔一二里放一个红条条，哪有红条条敌即从哪里走。在行军时表现缩畏，怕受歼灭。
    三、不先到边地活动，而长途的向我腹地偷袭。道坪离榆次城五十余里，以为不要紧，情报不灵通，岗哨不健全，敌人到了才知道敌人来了；只有武委会主任赵爱羊同志一人按了两个地雷，炸死炸伤敌人三个。现二区公所已派干部到道坪恢复情绪，拿此次战争实际情况教育群众，提高群众对敌仇恨，加强对敌斗争，整顿组织，武装保卫麦收。（寿阳办公室高臣唐）
