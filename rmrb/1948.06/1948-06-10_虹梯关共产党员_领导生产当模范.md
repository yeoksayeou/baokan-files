　　Hongtiji Communist Party Members
  　Lead Production and Serve as Models
    [Ping Shun News] After the work team in Hongtiji, Sixth District, carried out preliminary democratic party rectification in the village, the relationship between the Party and the masses was strengthened. Party members actively led the masses in production, going deep into various mutual aid teams. Each party member was passionately and lovingly with the masses, democratically discussing and arranging life, and conducting inspections at any time within the mutual aid team. In sowing and weaving, party members led production, and many production models and activists emerged. After sowing, in order to further promote future production, all six production brigades and twenty-seven mutual aid teams, and thirty weaving teams in the village, after seven days of democratic discussion and deliberation by each team, proposed that party member Guo Wusuo, after party rectification, had a good democratic leadership style in production. In the mutual aid team, Guo Wusuo always carried the big manure bucket. They also mentioned that the old man Huang Jianxi was very old (over sixty), but he was very energetic and got up very early to urge everyone to go to the fields. Chang San was active in production and consistently spoke the truth in the democratic party rectification movement. As a result of the election, among the sixteen production models, there were two male party members and two female party members. Party member Guo Wusuo received the most votes. Now they are promoting the masses to carry out weeding. (Hai Zhong, Cheng Fu, Shi Xiu)
