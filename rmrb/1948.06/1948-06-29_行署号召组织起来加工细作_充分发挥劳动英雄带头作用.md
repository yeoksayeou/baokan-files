　　Taihang News: The Taihang Administrative Office issued instructions to various special districts, counties, and cities at the beginning of this month, calling for organized action, promoting the leading role of heroes, and seizing the leadership in weeding and topdressing to increase production. The instructions stated in brief: Our district did not prepare for agricultural production last winter, and the spring sowing was also very rough, so the key to increasing production is weeding and topdressing. Leaders at all levels must be vigilant: if the seedlings are neglected, it will cause famine and affect military and civilian food supplies and support for the war. To this end, we call on the entire region to promote past experience, extensively organize, and make every effort to weed and topdress in the mountains, and fully protect wheat and weed cotton in the plains, preparing for planting under the wheat fields. The instructions called for careful and refined farming to make up for previous shortcomings. It is said that this spring, a tendency to not dare to emphasize organization has emerged in various places, believing that the leadership's emphasis will lead to bureaucratism, turning democratic leadership and voluntary combination into laissez-faire, which is extremely wrong. We must emphasize organization, but at the same time, we must pay special attention to organizing women and auxiliary labor to participate in the great production movement. We must give full play to the leading role of labor heroes and cultivate more new heroes. Encourage labor and conduct widespread literacy education. Otherwise, not only will production not increase, but even the production level of previous years cannot be guaranteed.

　　行署号召组织起来加工细作
  　充分发挥劳动英雄带头作用
    【太行讯】太行行署本月初向各专、县、市发出指示，号召组织起来，发扬英雄带头作用，抓紧领导锄苗、上追肥，增加生产。指示略谓：我区去冬对农业生产未做准备，今春播种又很粗糙，所以增产的关键就是锄苗与上追肥了。各级领导者必须警惕：如果荒了苗，就会造成灾荒，影响军需民食与支援战争。为此特号召全区发扬以往经验，广泛组织起来，山上全力锄苗、上追肥，山下全力保麦、锄花，准备麦地下种。指示号召要加工细作，弥补以前的窟窿。据称：今春各地发生不敢强调组织起来的倾向，认为领导上强调就会形成包办，把民主领导自愿结合变成了自流，这是极其错误的。对于组织起来，我们一定要强调，同时须特别注意组织妇女及辅助劳力参加大生产运动。要充分发挥劳动英雄的带头作用，培养更多新英雄。鼓励劳动，普遍进行发行教育。否则不仅不能增产，连往年生产水平也无法保证。
