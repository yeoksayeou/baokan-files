Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Frontline, 23rd: The Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Kaifeng Frontline Command, on the eve of launching a general offensive against Kaifeng city, issued a proclamation to all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army besieged in Kaifeng, all personnel of the Kuomintang provincial, municipal, and county government agencies, all public and private shops, factories, banks, warehouses, post and telecommunications, transportation, and other economic institutions in Kaifeng city, Henan University and other schools, hospitals, churches, libraries, and other cultural institutions, and citizens of all classes and industries in Kaifeng, stating:

	First, our army has an absolute advantage in both military strength and firepower over the defending forces in Kaifeng. The reinforcements you are waiting for have also been cut off by our army and cannot approach. All your resistance is a meaningless sacrifice that harms both yourselves and others. If you care about your own safety and the lives and property of all the people in the city, you should immediately lay down your arms and open the city to welcome our army. Our army solemnly takes responsibility for protecting the safety of all your officers and soldiers. As long as you do this immediately, minimizing the loss of life and property of residents inside and outside Kaifeng city, and the damage to public and private buildings, our army will consider you to have contributed to the protection of the city, and all officers and soldiers will be treated leniently. If you do not do this and stubbornly resist, our army will resolutely eliminate you until you all lay down your arms. Those who deliberately destroy weapons and materials or harm the lives and property of the people will be severely punished by our army.

	Second, both before and after our army enters the city, all agencies, organizations, and people of all walks of life in the city must jointly be responsible for maintaining order throughout the city, and no destruction is allowed. All officials and police of the Kuomintang provincial, municipal, and county government agencies, and all personnel in the economic and cultural institutions belonging to the Kuomintang government, must work as usual with peace of mind, and be responsible for protecting all the assets and documents of their respective agencies, awaiting our army's disposition. They must not be derelict in their duties or damage them, nor engage in conspiracies of sabotage. All officials and police who do not resist with weapons will not be captured or arrested by our army. All those who contribute to protecting the order of the city will be treated favorably by our army. Other schools, churches, hospitals, and all private factories, shops, and residences will be protected by our army and shall not be violated. It is hoped that all public-spirited social organizations and impartial individuals will cooperate with our army after it enters the city to jointly maintain order throughout the city and avoid destruction. It is hoped that all citizens will live and work in peace and contentment and not alarm each other.
