Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th -- TASS reports: British Member of Parliament Zilliacus, who is visiting Poland, told reporters in Warsaw on the 8th that the main prerequisite for resolving international disputes is to cease interference in all countries from China to France. The policies of the United States are destined to fail. Developments in China and Greece have proven this. The interventionist policies of the United States should be replaced by improved economic relations based on sincere, friendly cooperation and the revitalization of Europe. The revitalization of France and Italy is completely impossible without the participation and full trust of the working class's trade unions and parties. However, U.S. aid to France and Italy is conditional on excluding representatives of the working class from power. These representatives of the working class are the communists, and in Italy, the People's Democratic Front. Those implementing the Marshall Plan are similarly attempting to interfere in Britain's internal affairs, threatening to halt "aid" if Britain nationalizes its steel industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th -- TASS, London, 12th -- Jimmy Dimides, editor of the Greek democratic newspaper "Vima," published in London, described his recent month-long experience in Greece, stating that he had visited Greek democratic leaders and General Markos. Although lacking in everything, Free Greece has extremely high morale and full confidence in victory. He said he had not seen any evidence of foreign aid to the Greek democratic forces. The uniforms worn by the democratic army and the weapons they seized were all British and American.

　　中国与希腊形势的发展
  　注定美国必败
  　齐里亚库斯斥美干涉政策
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：在波兰访问的英国会议员齐里亚库斯于八日在华沙告记者称：解决国际间争执问题的主要先决条件，是在从中国起至法国止的各国停止干涉。美国的政策是注定了要失败的。中国与希腊形势的发展已证明了这一点。美国的干涉政策，应代以在真诚友好合作与复兴欧洲的基础上改进经济关系。法国和意大利的复兴如无工人阶级的职工会和政党的参加以及它们的充分信任，是完全不可能的。可是美国对法国与意大利的援助是以将工人阶级的代表排斥于政权之外为条件的。这种工人阶级的代表是共产党，在意大利是人民民主阵线。马歇尔计划的执行者同样企图干涉英国的内政，他们威胁说：如果英国实行钢铁国有化，就停止“援助”。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社教伦十二日电，在伦敦出版的希腊民主报纸维马报编辑吉米德斯，描述他最近一月在希腊的经历称：他曾访问过希腊民主领袖及马科斯将军。自由希腊虽然一切都很缺乏，但士气极高，对胜利有充分信心。他说：他没有见到有外国援助希腊民主军的事实。民主军穿的军服和缴获来的武器，都是英国的和美国的。
