Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Shanghai St. John's University students have risen up in protest against American imperialist interference in the patriotic democratic movement of Chinese students. According to foreign press reports, the students have formally demanded that the school authorities immediately disclose the content of the meeting between officials from the American embassy and consulate and the university president, Tu Yuqing. The students angrily pointed out that shortly after the visit of the American diplomatic officials, the school authorities demonstrated the first attempt to interfere with the "Race Exhibition," which has now been declared closed as of the afternoon of the 29th of last month. When meeting with reporters, the students pointed out that what they oppose is not the American people, but only the reactionary policy of the American government to fully support the revival of Japanese aggressive forces and threaten China. At the same time, the small number of secret agents planted by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in various schools have formed the so-called "Bandit Suppression and National Reconstruction Association," and most of them have begun to carry canes, looking for various reasons to suppress patriotic and democratic students. Shanghai military police have been divided into ten teams to monitor the actions of students in various schools. Under orders from the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the authorities of Shanghai University have been forced to disband the school's patriotic student organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. Further news on the Shanghai student patriotic movement: The "Race Exhibition" hosted by students of St. John's University is extremely popular with the people, and students from various schools and people from all walks of life have flocked to visit. According to Reuters and United Press in Shanghai, the campus is plastered with patriotic slogans opposing American imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces and threatening China. The exhibition room has a "Social Hall" which displays various woodcut cartoons with patriotic democracy as the theme. The largest of these depicts a hideous Uncle Sam (referring to American imperialism), a rogue in a black cloak (referring to public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, because the Chiang bandit often wears a black cloak), and a Japanese soldier stabbing a group of Chinese civilians with a bayonet, satirizing the US-Chiang-Japan collaboration to slaughter the Chinese people. One depicts a fierce-looking war-monger MacArthur with a pipe in his mouth, pouring gasoline into an erupting Japanese volcano with one hand, and vigorously fanning the crater with the other. Another depicts the ferocious image of Kannei Horinouchi, a Japanese advisor hired by Soong Tzu-wen, condemning Soong's crime of colluding with Japanese bandits to continue exploiting the Chinese people.
