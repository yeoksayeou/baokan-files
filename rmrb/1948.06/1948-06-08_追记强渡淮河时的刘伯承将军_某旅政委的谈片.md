　　Remembering General Liu Bocheng During the Forced Crossing of the Huai River
  　A Talk by a Political Commissar of a Certain Brigade
    When the Liu-Deng army launched a counter-offensive south across the Huai River, making a thousand-mile leap and penetrating deep into the heart of the Chiang bandits last autumn, the old people of the Dabie Mountains spread many myths: some said that in June this year, it snowed cotton ball-sized snowflakes, and the People's Liberation Army crossed the Huai River on ice; some said that each person used a gourd to float across; and others said that a great yellow wind arose, blowing Liu Bocheng's 600,000 troops all over the mountains and fields to the Dabie Mountains. What was the actual situation? Comrade So-and-so, the political commissar of a certain brigade, told a moving story.
    Our army fought to the Dabie Mountains to establish a new base area. When the enemy discovered our army's great strategic intention, they pieced together nineteen brigades to desperately besiege our army. After our army broke through the enemy's blockade and forced the crossing of the Ru River, the enemy attempted to stop our army from advancing between the Ru River and the Huai River.
    On the evening of August 26, our army arrived at a crossing on the north bank of the Huai River. About × brigades of troops were gathered here to cross the river. According to the investigation by the brigade commander and myself, the river water could have been waded across, but before the crossing, the upper reaches of the Huai River suddenly rose, and all that our army could rely on to cross the river were ten or so small wooden boats left behind after the enemy destroyed and looted them. Chief of Staff Li Da of the headquarters told me that the enemy's 48th Division, 7th Division, 58th Division, 10th Division, 3rd Division, 65th Division, 52nd Division, 1st Cavalry Brigade, and other nineteen brigades were closely following our army. The vanguard of the enemy's 85th Division was only thirty-odd miles away from us and had already made contact with our rearguard troops. Our army had to cross the Huai River within the next two days, so he told my brigade that it must complete the crossing before twelve o'clock that night.
    I ran to supervise immediately, but the crossing troops were crowded at the crossing, and the order was not good enough. I painstakingly straightened it out for a while, but it was impossible to finish the crossing before twelve o'clock. I went to see Chief of Staff Li again, and he kept his mouth tightly shut, pondering. Finally, he said, "Then, it must be finished before two o'clock." I ran to the crossing again, and the order of crossing had been greatly improved. Not a minute was wasted, and it could barely be completed on time. However, a sudden strong wind arose, and the round trip time of each boat had to be increased by more than double. Obviously, the stipulated time was completely insufficient. I anxiously reported to Chief of Staff Li again, and he helplessly pushed the time to before dawn. In fact, this was still very difficult. I thought that my brigade only accounted for a quarter of the crossing troops at this crossing. If my brigade occupied more than a whole night, what about the rest of the people? Without confidence, I walked to the pier again to direct the troops to cross the river. After a while, I went to the brigade headquarters.
    The brigade headquarters was located in a small house on the north bank of the river. Chief leaders such as Liu and Deng were all here. Everyone hadn't said a word for a long time, and they were all using their brains to defeat the Huai River. General Liu, who had been pondering all along, suddenly asked me, "Is it really impossible to wade across the river?" "The river is too deep to wade across." I answered affirmatively. "Is it equally deep everywhere? Is it impossible to wade across anywhere?" General Liu asked again, and I said, "The old people on the river all say that the Huai River rises and falls suddenly, and no one has ever dared to wade across when the water is rising deeply." "Have you really personally scouted or tried it?" I said, "The vanguard regiment and ourselves have both scouted and tried it." General Liu still carefully repeatedly questioned the situation of all aspects of the Huai River, and finally asked half-doubtfully, "Have you investigated with the folks to see if there is, ask a few more folks." General Liu walked to the river bank and silently looked at the surging turbid flow of the Huai River, and immediately decided to first transfer a part of his command personnel across.
    I returned to the crossing to make arrangements. Before long, General Liu came. He took a very long bamboo pole, I don't know who found him such an unsuitable walking stick. When General Liu boarded the boat, it was almost dawn, and the moon had already set. In the hazy darkness, I saw his black shadow moving up and down beside the boat. I was very curious about what he was doing. Suddenly, I heard him shouting loudly on the boat, "So-and-so, can build a bridge! I have tried many places, the river water is not too deep!" And he shouted vigorously, telling Chief of Staff Li to resolutely build a bridge. Only then did I suddenly realize that General Liu was personally measuring the depth of the water with a bamboo pole beside the boat. I carried out his order. When he was about to board the boat, he received another letter, which read: "The river water is not deep, and the flow rate is very slow. Quickly tell Chief of Staff Li to build a bridge." I went to the south bank, and General Liu was standing by the river watching us cross the river. After crossing the river, when he saw me, he asked me to write a letter to Chief of Staff Li in his name, saying that we must try our best to resolutely and quickly build a bridge. He also instructed me to add circles next to the words, because after I finished writing the letter, I read it to him once, and he said, "Add another layer of circles outside those circles." After the letter was sent out, he said in a serious tone, "Carelessness will kill people," and he heavily tapped the ground with the bamboo pole and repeated, "Will kill people." I stood quietly in front of his tall figure, his forever kind and amiable face always沉 in solemnity, his words, word by word, were like a thousand-pound hammer hitting my heart. Before he left, he said to me again, "Comrade So-and-so, the more critical the moment, the more important it is for leading cadres to personally take action and conduct on-the-spot reconnaissance." He looked at me forcefully, as if he wanted to engrave these words in my mind.
    Before long, a political commissar of a nearby regiment sent me a letter telling me that the river water could be waded across. I quickly invited that regimental political commissar to ask for clarification. It turned out that a groom had fallen behind and could not get on the boat, so he waded over from the upper reaches of the river. I was extremely happy. I remembered General Liu's words, "Carelessness will kill people," which were absolutely correct. I quickly wrote a letter reporting this good news to General Liu. I had just put the letter in the envelope when I unexpectedly received his letter, in which he said that he personally saw people leading horses across the river in the upper reaches, proving that it was completely possible to wade across, and he told me to immediately inform Chief of Staff Li not to build a bridge and to have the troops quickly wade across. So the troops quickly began to wade across. With a feeling of incomparable relief, I went to see General Liu, where the sun had already risen above the horizon. This tireless old man was smiling and standing on the top of the mountain, looking down at the turbid flow of the Huai River, watching his invincible victorious army in thousands of troops, divided into four, five, and six routes along the water markers marked with bamboo poles, and triumphantly stepped across the Huai River, overcoming the last dangerous pass in the thousand-mile southern expedition.

　　追记强渡淮河时的刘伯承将军
  　某旅政委的谈片
    当去年秋天刘邓反攻大军南渡淮河、千里跃进、深入蒋匪心脏作战的时候，大别山的老百姓传说着许多神话：有的说，今年六月下着棉花球那样大的雪，解放军是踏着冰通过淮河的；有的说，是每人拿了一个葫芦浮过来的；又有的说，是起了一阵大黄风，把刘伯承将军的六十万人马满山遍野一飘，就飘到大别山来的。实际情形是怎样呢？某旅政委某某同志谈了一个动人的故事。
    我军打到大别山，建立新的根据地。当敌人发觉我军这一伟大的战略企图时，就拼凑了十九个旅，死迫我军。在我军突破了敌人的封锁，强渡汝河后，敌人就企图在汝河与淮河之间来阻止我大军前进。
    八月二十六日晚，我军到达淮河北岸某地渡口。这里集结约有×个旅的人马要过河。根据旅长和我的调查，河水本来可以徒涉，但在渡河之前，淮河上游突然涨水，我军所要赖以渡河的，只是靠敌人破坏和劫走后所剩下的十来只小木船。司令部李达参谋长告诉我说：敌人的四十八师、七师、五十八师、十师、三师、六十五师、五十二师、骑一旅等十九个旅，紧跟着我军。敌八十五师的先头部队，距我们只有三十多里，已经和我后卫部队接触了。我军必须在今明两天渡过淮河，因此他叫我旅必须在夜十二点以前渡完。
    我连忙跑去监督，渡河部队拥挤在渡口，秩序不够好。我费劲整顿了一番，但要在十二点以前渡完，是不可能的。我又去找李参谋长，他一直紧闭着嘴，沉思着。最后，他说：“那么，一定要在下两点渡完。”我又跑到渡口去，渡河的秩序已经大大改善，一分钟都没有浪费，算起来勉强可以按时过完。但是，忽然起了一阵大风，每一船的来往时间，要增加一倍以上。显然所规定的时间，是完全不够分配的了。我焦虑的再去报告李参谋长，他无可奈何的把时间推到拂晓以前。其实这仍然是很困难的。我想我旅只占这个渡口渡河部队的四分之一，如果我旅就占去一个整夜还多的时间，那么其余的人怎么办呢？我没有信心的又走向码头去，指挥队伍过河。一会我去到旅指挥所。
    旅指挥所设在河北岸一间小屋子里，刘邓等首长们都在这里。大家很久不说一句话，都在用脑筋非战胜淮河不可。一直在沉思着的刘司令员忽然问我：“河水真的不能徒涉吗？”“河水很深不能徒涉”。我肯定的回答。“到处都一样深吗？到处都不能徒涉吗”？刘司令员又问，我说：“河上的老百姓都这样说淮河忽涨忽落，从来没有人敢在水涨得正深的时候徒涉”。“你们实在亲自侦查或试过没有”？我说：“先锋团和我们自己都侦查过试过”。刘司令员还是细心的反复追问淮河各方面的情形，最后半怀疑的问道：“你们是不是找老乡调查了有没有，多找几个老乡问一问。”刘司令员走到河岸上静默的望了望汹涌澎湃的淮河的浊流，立即决定先把他的指挥人员渡过一部分去。
    我回到渡口去布置，不一会，刘司令员走来了，他拿了一根很长的竹竿不知是谁给他找来这样一根不合适的手杖。刘司令员登上船时天快要黎明，月亮已经落下去了，迷茫中我看见他的黑影子在船边一上一下的活动着，我很奇怪他到底在作什么，忽然我听见他在船上大声喊我某某能架桥呀，我试了好多地方，河水并不太深啊，并且用力的喊，告诉李参谋长，叫他坚决架桥，这时我才恍然大悟原来刘司令员是在船边亲自用竹竿测量水的深度，我执行了他的命令。临上船时又接到一封信上写：“河水不深，流速甚缓，速告李参谋长架桥。”我到了南岸刘司令员正站在河边看我们渡河，过了河见了我又叫我用他的名义写信给李参谋长，要想尽一切办法坚决迅速架桥。他并且吩咐我要在字的旁边加上圈，因我写完信读给他听了一遍，他说：“在那圈圈的外边再套上一层圈圈”。信发出去了，他用严肃的口吻对我说：“粗枝大叶就要害死人”，并且用那根竹竿在地上重重的点着又重复了一句要害死人。我静静的站在他魁梧的身影前，他那永远挂着慈祥的和蔼面孔一直沉在严肃里，他的话一字一句象千斤重锤打在我的心上。在他临走时，他又对我说：“某某同志，越是到紧要关头，领导干部越扼要亲自动手，实地侦查。”他用力的看着我，象要把这些话刻在我的脑子里一样。
    不一会，我旁一个团政委给我来了一封信，告诉我河水能够徒涉，我赶紧把那个团政委请来问个明白，原来是一个马夫掉了队，上不去船于是从河的上游徒涉过来。我高兴的了不得，我想起了刘司令员那句“粗枝大叶就要害死人”的话，一点也不错，我赶紧把这个好消息写信报告刘司令员，我刚刚把信装进信封，想不到又接到他的来信，他说他亲自看见上游有人牵马渡河，证明完全可以徒涉，叫我立即转告李参谋长不要架桥了，叫部队迅速徒涉，于是部队很快的就开始徒涉了。我带着无比的欣慰的心情，去见刘司令员，那里这时太阳已经露出地平线，这位不知疲倦的老人微笑着站在山头上俯视着淮河的浊流，望着他那无敌的常胜军千军万马沿着用竹竿标志着的水上路标分成四路五路六路，浩浩荡荡踏过淮河，战胜了千里南征中最后的一个险关。
