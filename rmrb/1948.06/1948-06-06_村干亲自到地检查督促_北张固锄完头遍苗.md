　　Village Cadres Personally Inspect and Supervise
　　Beizhanggu Finishes First Round of Weeding
　　[Our dispatch] Village cadres in Beizhanggu Village, the third district of Guangping, previously did not understand the Party rectification and were passive in their work, holding a "do not get involved" attitude, and did not hold mass meetings for a long time. Since participating in the district meeting, their thinking has been straightened out, and they have returned to the village to explain the middle peasant policy to the masses and actively lead mass production. In particular, the director of the production committee carries a manure basket to the fields during breaks every day, and if he sees someone whose land has not been weeded, he goes to their home to mobilize them. Once, he went to the west end and saw that the two mu of land of San Piancheng (who has no labor power) had not been turned over, so he immediately went to his home to explain the benefits of turning the soil to San Piancheng's mother in detail. After listening, the mother and son began to dig the land, and now it is almost finished. Zhang Tianjun likes to eat well and dress well and does not do any proper work. Several mu of land are always left uncultivated, and the walls of the house have collapsed, but he does not repair them. This year, under the leadership of the village cadres, he is determined to build a house and repair the courtyard wall. At the beginning, the masses said that he could not do it, but under the direct education, transformation, and leadership of the village cadres, he built three rooms, and the courtyard walls were built neatly. The masses said, "If the Eighth Route Army had not come, it would not have been so good for five years." This year, he planted five mu of sorghum, which has already been fertilized once and weeded twice. Under the leadership of the village cadres, the whole village has finished weeding the spring seedlings.

　　村干亲自到地检查督促
  　北张固锄完头遍苗
    【本报消息】广平三区北张固村干，先前对整党不摸底，对工作消极，抱着“不多事”态度，很长时间就不开群众会。自从参加区里会议以后，思想才打通了，回村与群众讲解中农政策，积极领导群众生产。特别是生产委员会主任，每天休息时背起粪筐往地里串，看谁地没有锄，就去他家动员。一次他走到西头见三偏成（没劳力）二亩地还没有翻起来，就马上到他家去向三偏成母亲详细解说翻土的好处，他娘俩听罢，就开始掘地，现在已经快掘完了。张天军好吃好穿不作一点正事，有几亩地老是荒着，房屋墙头倒塌一片也不修理；今年在村干领导下，决心盖房修理院墙。开始群众都说他干不成，但在村干直接教育改造领导下，盖起了三间房，院墙都打的齐齐整整，群众都说：“要不是八路军来，五年也不能转变这样好。”他今年耩了五亩高粱，已经上了一次粪，锄了两遍。在村干领导下全村春苗都锄完了。
