　　Introduction to New Soviet Inventions Awarded Stalin Prizes

　　Engineer Ignatov and six other workers engaged in the restoration of the Donets coal mine designed a drainage machine that uses compressed air for drainage. The result of its use was that the Donets coal mine was able to drain as much as 600 million cubic meters of accumulated water poured in by the German invaders, creating an unprecedented rate in the history of coal mine reconstruction worldwide.

　　Ten engineers from the Leningrad Power and Electrical Equipment Factory, under the leadership of Professor Kasyanov, designed a giant direct current electric machine for the steel rolling industry and a turbine generator with a power generation capacity of 100,000 and a speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute. This invention propelled the Soviet electrical machinery industry to the forefront of the world engineering community.

　　Chief Engineer Makarov of the Karaganda Coal Mine designed a combined crushing and loading machine driven by four people, which mechanized the process of crushing and loading coal. This machine can crush 30 to 100 tons of coal per hour and automatically load the coal onto coal trucks. Using ordinary methods, this would require 32 workers to work for four hours. The efficiency of this machine is far higher than similar machines manufactured in Britain and the United States.

　　Engineer Kananing invented a new type of high-speed automatic textile machine, which occupies 20 percent less area than ordinary textile machines, but its efficiency is increased by two and a half times, and the management is also simpler.

　　Engineers Mayat and Moiseev invented a flax combine harvester, driven by two people, which can harvest five hectares of flax per day, saving the equivalent of 72 ordinary man-days.

　　荣获斯大林奖金的苏联新发明介绍
    工程师伊格纳托夫与其他六个从事恢复顿尼兹煤矿的工人，设计了一种利用压缩空气排水的排水机。使用的结果，使顿尼兹煤矿排除了德国侵略者灌入的积水达六亿立方公尺之多，在全世界重修煤矿史中创造了空前的速率。
    列宁格勒电力，电工器材厂十个工程师在卡西扬诺夫教授领导之下，设计了一种用于辗钢工业的巨型直流电力机与发电量达十万的涡轮发电机，每分钟转三千次，苏联电机工业因此种发明而进入世界工程界的前列。
    卡拉干达煤矿首席工程师马卡罗夫，设计了四个人驾驶的打碎与装运车联合机，使打碎与装运煤炭的运程机械化，这种机器每小时能打碎三十到一百吨煤，并自动把煤装上运煤车，如用普通方法这需要三十二个工人工作四小时，这种机器的效率远高于英美制造的同类机器。
    工程师堪纳宁发明了新型的高速度自动纺织机，它占的面积比普通纺织机小百分之二十，但效率却提高了两倍半，管理也更为简单。
    工程师马雅特和莫埃赛耶夫发明了亚麻联合收割机，由两个人驾驶，一天收割五公顷的亚麻，节省了普通的七十二个人工。
