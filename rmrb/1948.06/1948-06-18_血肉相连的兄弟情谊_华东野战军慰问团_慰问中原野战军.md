A certain communications squad leader said to the soldiers on the way back from the show: "This is like attending a political class. After entering the city, we must not eat, drink, and mess around, and become detached from the masses. You see, Li Chuang Wang became detached from the masses, and later he couldn't even get food."

    【新华社中原前线十六日电】人民解放军华东野战军政治部主任唐亮将军，于五月中旬，率领由三个文工团组成的慰问团，亲赴中原某地，慰问刘邓部队。当唐亮同志及其所率领的慰问团，在第一次慰问晚会上出现时，全场热烈鼓掌，向华东野战军致敬，并欢迎慰问团的到来。在欢呼声中，唐亮同志即席代表华东野战军全体同志，对中原解放军全体同志致亲切而热情的敬意和慰问。他指出过去战斗中血肉相连的兄弟情谊，并强调学习中原野战军灵活的战术和研究战术的精神、切实朴素和艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。号召今后在党中央正确路线和中原局的统一领导下，并肩为解放全部中原而共同努力。
    继由中原野战军副政治委员张际春将军一代表中原野战军向华东野战军全体同志致敬，并表示深切的谢意。刘邓两将军旋于某日设宴招待全体慰问团。在欢宴中慰问团向刘邓诸将军致敬。刘伯承将军亦即席讲话，盛赞华东野战军在协同作战中，对中原野战军歼敌致胜与坚持大别山作战的直接帮助。并赞扬华东部队在作战中勇猛顽强，善于研究敌人，及军事艺术和政治工作上的许多创造。同时他又指出华东野战军部队中的戏剧、音乐、新闻、摄影等等文化工作，都做得很好，有很多建树。应该大大提倡。
    慰问团在中原野战军各部队，先后举行过七次慰问晚会，特别制有慰问歌。演出有“李闯王”，“白毛女”，“血泪仇”，“好同志有错就改”，“两种作风”，“兄妹开荒”，“逃出阎王殿”，“血肉相连”等名剧，并展览照片，放映电影。演出后在部队中深获好评，尤以“李闯王”一剧，给观众以很大教育与警惕。某通讯班长在散戏归途中对战士们说：“这好比上了一次政治课。打进城市后，可不敢大吃大喝胡搞乱搞，脱离群众。你看李闯王脱离了群众，后来连饭也吃不上了。”
