Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st. The Miaofeng Mountain temple fair, 70 li west of Pingxi, was held as usual from the first to the fourteenth day of the fourth lunar month this year, under the protection of the local democratic government. Pilgrims and tourists from places like Peiping and Tianjin, undeterred by the threats and obstruction of the Kuomintang bandit troops, came in an endless stream, taking the opportunity to visit the construction of the liberated areas and purchase local products such as roses, camellias, dates, and wine. Pilgrims and tourists from the Chiang Kai-shek areas attached great importance to the Land Law Outline promulgated by the Chinese Communist Party and scrambled to obtain copies. Merchants from Peiping and Tianjin were very interested in the democratic government's protection and development of industry and commerce, and they greatly envied the liberated areas' loans and grain lending to develop production, as well as the stability of people's lives and the stability of prices. They said, "Here (referring to the liberated areas), every possible way is found to ensure that the people have food and clothing, while there (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek areas) they do not care about the life or death of the people." Before leaving, a certain pilgrim from Peiping warmly asked the staff of the democratic government, "When will you enter Peiping?"

　　平西妙峰山庙会
  　蒋区香客不绝于途
    【新华社晋察冀一日电】平西七十里妙峰山的庙会，本年旧历四月初一至十四日，在当地民主政府保护下照常举行。平津等地香客游人，不顾国民党匪军的恫吓阻挠，络驿前来，借机参观解放区建设，与购买当地著名的玫瑰、山茶、枣、酒等土产。蒋区香客游人对中共颁布的土地法大纲，极为重视，争相索阅。平津商人对民主政府保护与发展工商业甚感兴趣，对解放区贷款贷粮发展生产，以及人民生活安定，物价平稳，非常羡慕。他们说：“这里（指解放区）想尽办法使老百姓有吃有穿，那里（指蒋区）却不管老百姓死活。”北平某某香客在临行前，亲热地问民主政府工作人员：“您们什么时候进北平？”
