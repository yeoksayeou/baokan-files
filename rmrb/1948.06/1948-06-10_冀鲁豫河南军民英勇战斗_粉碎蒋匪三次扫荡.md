　　Soldiers and Civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Fight Heroically, Crushing Chiang Kai-shek's Three "Sweeping Campaigns"
[Our dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th of this month] The broad masses of the people on the south bank of the Yellow River have suffered terribly from the burning, killing, destruction, and looting of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, which has made them even more united in fighting. Since this spring, mass guerrilla warfare has flourished everywhere, and has successively crushed the enemy's three "encirclement and suppression sweeping campaigns" against our Second, Seventh, and Fifth Military Sub-districts and west of the Grand Canal, mainly carried out by the enemy's Fifth Division in combination with its local miscellaneous Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit tactics are inherited from the "coordinated advance and combined attack", "stationing and clearing", "comb-style", and "net-style" tactics used by the Japanese invaders, as well as nighttime encirclements or raids, attempting to destroy our village governments, seize conscripts, and destroy tunnels. The viciousness of their methods is even worse than that of the Japanese invaders. The 45th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, which occupied Yuncheng, carried more than 20 large carts every day to loot everywhere. The following rhyme was popular in Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Division: "Enter the village, slaughter the pigs first, then kill the sheep, and take the girls away before leaving." They even released poison gas, such as in the areas west of Kaocheng, Heze, and Dingtao, poisoning the masses hidden in our tunnels to death, and then taking out their corpses and chopping them in half with铡 knives. Under such cruel "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, the people of Henan have heroically and unyieldingly launched an anti-Chiang Kai-shek upsurge everywhere. The military and civilians are closely united and have adopted various forms of struggle against the enemy, capturing scattered personnel of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits everywhere. In Kaocheng's Fifth District, the militia captured more than 50 enemies in the first ten days of April alone. The Shanxian militia also captured more than 50 enemies in the first ten days of May. This gave the enemy a great threat, making them afraid to go out. The Shanxian Caoma District Armed Work Team relied on tunnels and used landmines to kill more than 30 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's 96th Brigade. The enemy attacked them with a battalion of troops, but they persisted for a day, repelling several enemy assaults and seizing more than 50 pieces of weapons such as 60mm mortars and machine guns. Because our troops implemented the policy of relying on the masses to persist in dispersed guerrilla warfare, they struck at the enemy and protected the interests of the masses. Our troops overcame all difficulties in the face of fierce struggles, fought against the enemy, and contained the enemy. For example, the Independent First Battalion of the Third Military Sub-district did not give up any opportunity to defeat the combined attack of two companies of Chiang Kai-shek's parachute troops and more than 1,000 local bandits. When the enemy from Chen Manzhuang in Shanxian went to Southern Shanxian to carry out a "sweeping campaign," as soon as they left their nest, our militia destroyed their roadblocks, causing the enemy to flee back in a panic, cooperating with the anti-"sweeping campaign" in Southern Shanxian. In the area east of the Grand Canal, the task of annihilating the enemy on the inner lines and expanding the liberated areas has also been actively carried out since this spring. In March, when Pingyin and Dong'a were occupied by the enemy, our military sub-district's armed forces raided Yanghe Dajicheng and completely annihilated an enemy battalion. Our Changqing Brigade and Ningyang Brigade also successively annihilated one puppet district and township government each. In early April and late May, Wang Yaowu, the bandit chief in Jinan, twice attempted to reoccupy Dong'a and Pingyin with the Security Brigade combined with local bandits, but they were both driven back by our local armed forces. The mass armed forces in this area twice cooperated with the Shandong main force in combat, destroying the Jinpu Railway and destroying a total of nine bridges. Now the soldiers and civilians of Henan are actively attacking the enemy's raids and defending the wheat harvest.

　　冀鲁豫河南军民英勇战斗
  　粉碎蒋匪三次扫荡
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】黄河南岸广大人民，惨遭蒋匪烧杀破坏与抢掠，使他们更加团结起来战斗。今春以来，群众性的游击战争，到处蓬勃展开，一连粉碎了敌人以五师为主，结合其土杂蒋匪向我二、七、五分区及运河以西的三次清剿扫荡。蒋匪战术是承袭了日寇所使用的“分进合击”、“驻扎清剿”、“篦梳式”、“拉网式”、夜间包围或奔袭，企图摧毁我村政权，抓壮丁，破坏地道，其手段之毒辣，比日寇有过之无不及。进占郓城的蒋匪第四十五旅，每日携带二十余辆大车到处抢掠。蒋五师中流行着这样的歌谣：“进村庄，先宰猪，后杀羊，临走拉着花姑娘。”甚至施放毒气，如考城、菏泽及定陶以西地区，将我藏在地道内之群众毒死，后又弄出其尸首，用铡刀铡断。河南的人民，在蒋匪军这样残酷的清剿下，英勇不屈的到处掀起了反蒋的热潮，军民紧密的团结在一起，向敌人采取了各式各样的斗争。到处活捉蒋匪零星人员。考城五区民兵，只四月上旬，就捉到敌人五十多个。单县民兵在五月上旬，也捉到敌人五十多个。这给敌人以很大威胁，使敌人不敢外出。单县曹马区武工组，依靠地道，使用地雷，炸死蒋匪九十六旅三十多人。敌人以一个营的兵力向他们进攻，他们坚持了一天，打退敌人数次冲锋，缴六○炮、机枪等武器五十余件。由于我部队执行了依靠群众分散坚持游击战争的方针，打击了敌人，保护了群众利益。我部队在斗争尖锐的情况下，克服下了一切困难，与敌进行斗争，并牵制了敌人。如三分区独立一营，不放弃一切机会，击溃蒋伞总两个连，及土顽一千余的合击。单县陈满庄敌人到单南扫荡，刚一离窠，就被我民兵将其鹿砦破坏，使敌慌忙回窜，配合了单南的反扫荡。在运河以东地区，今春以来，也积极执行了内线歼敌，扩大解放区的任务。三月间，平阴、东阿被敌人占领时，我分区武装奔袭杨河大吉城，全歼敌人一个营。我长清大队、宁阳大队，又连续歼灭伪区乡公所各一个。四月上旬及五月下旬，济南匪首王耀武两次以保安旅结合土顽，企图再占东阿、平阴城，但都被我地方武装打回去。该地区群众武装，两次配合山东大军作战，破袭了津浦路，共破桥九座。现在河南军民正在积极打击敌人出扰，保卫麦收。
