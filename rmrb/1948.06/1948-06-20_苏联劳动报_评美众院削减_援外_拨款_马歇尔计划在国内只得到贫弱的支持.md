  　Comments on US House of Representatives Cutting "Foreign Aid" Appropriations
    The Marshall Plan Receives Only Weak Support Domestically
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Moscow] TASS, Moscow: A Labor Newspaper international observer wrote on the 10th that the US House of Representatives' decision to reduce Marshall Plan appropriations by 25% has been met with strong dissatisfaction from Marshall, Vandenberg, and other politicians. Government figures are primarily distressed because the House of Representatives has raised the complex issue of relations between the US and Western European countries at the most inopportune time for the US government, precisely when American society is increasingly insistent on cancelling the foreign policy that causes international tension and disagreements between the US and the Soviet Union. Vandenberg has already demanded the cancellation of the House of Representatives' decision; however, even if the Senate supports Vandenberg, this will not produce immediate results. As a New York Times reporter said, because the Senate and the House of Representatives may have serious disagreements, this issue will be submitted to a joint conference committee of both houses, which will most likely strive to achieve compromises from both sides, and there is little hope that the House of Representatives' decision will be completely cancelled. Regardless of what results from the newly rekindled dispute in the US Congress regarding Marshall Plan appropriations, what is important is that the House of Representatives' decision first reveals that the Marshall Plan receives only rather weak support within the United States.

  　评美众院削减“援外”拨款
    马歇尔计划在国内只得到贫弱的支持
    【新华社电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报国际观察家于十日著文称：美众院通过减少马歇尔计划拨款百分之二十五的决定，遭到马歇尔、范登堡和其他政客方面的强烈不满。政府人士首先感到苦恼，因为众院在这对美政府最不合时宜的时候提出了美国与西欧国家关系的复杂问题，正当这个时候美国社会愈来愈坚持要求取消造成国际紧张形势与美苏分歧的外交政策。范登堡已要求取消众院的决定，然而即使参院支持范登堡，这也不会立即产生结果，正如纽约时报记者所说的一样，由于参院与众院或许会有严重分歧，这一问题就将提交两院联席会议解决，而这一联席会议十之八九将竭力取得双方的让步，众院的决定很难希望全部取消；不论美国国会中重新引起的关于马歇尔计划拨款的争执会产生何种结果，重要的是众院的决定首先透露了马歇尔计划在美国国内只得到颇为贫弱的支持。
