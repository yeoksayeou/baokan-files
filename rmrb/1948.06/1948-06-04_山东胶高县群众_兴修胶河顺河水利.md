Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: The measurement and design of the water conservancy projects on the Jiao River and Shun River in Jiaogao County (a newly established county, combining parts of Jiao County and Gaomi County) in the Binbei District of Jiaodong have been completed and construction began successively at the beginning of last month. When the engineering team was conducting measurements along the river, the farmers gathered around, competing to recount the history of flooding and provide suggestions for repair. The excavation line of the Shantou section of the Shun River project, after being modified according to the opinions of the masses, not only makes the water flow faster but also saves more than 500 workdays. The Dashiqiao section of the Jiao River project also adopted the opinions of the masses, retaining many wheat fields and shortening the project by nearly half a mile. In order to avoid any conflict between river repair and production, the masses put forward the slogan of "plant the land quickly, dig the river early" during the spring plowing, so the spring plowing and planting were generally completed ahead of schedule. At the same time, leadership and organization for river digging at all levels were established, and river engineering teams were formed. The river engineering teams were quickly formed through mass self-reporting and public discussion, exceeding the plan. For example, the He'ai District originally planned to organize 2,600 workdays, but as a result, more than 3,700 workdays were organized. In Yanjiazhuang, out of a total of 680 people, twelve river engineering teams were organized, with 143 participants. In order to solve the food shortage, river digging was appropriately combined with sideline production. In Longyuguan Village, Xiazhuang District, out of a total of 60 laborers, 45 people were digging the river, and the remaining 15 people were transporting grain between Pingdu and Liugou, earning 15 to 50 jin of sorghum per trip per cart (one person per cart), which was used to regulate food consumption. Currently, four districts, including Xiazhuang, Shunhe, Jiangzhuang, and He'ai, have started work on the two projects. Within seven days of starting work, half of the Xiazhuang section of the Shun River project has been completed. Some individual villages, such as Xifujiazhuang, are nearing completion. The He'ai section of the Jiao River project was originally scheduled to be completed in 20 days, but according to the current labor efficiency, it is estimated that it can be completed five days ahead of schedule.

　　山东胶高县群众
  　兴修胶河顺河水利
    【新华社华东一日电】胶东滨北分区胶高县（新设县，胶县、高密各一部）胶河顺河两处水利工程测量设计完毕，已于上月初旬陆续开工。当工程队沿河进行测量时，农民群集周围争相叙述泛患由来经过，并提供修治意见。顺河工程坊头段的挖河工程线，根据群众意见，修正后不仅可使水流畅速，且可节省五百余工。胶河工程之大石桥段，也采纳群众意见，保留了许多麦田，并缩短近半里路工程，为使修河生产两不相误，在春耕中群众提出“快种地、早挖河”的口号，所以春耕春种一般都提前完成。并结合建立各级挖河领导与组织，编制了河工队，经过群众自报公议河工队迅速编好，并超过计划。如河崖区原计划组织两千六百工，但结果组织起三千七百余工，阎家庄共六百八十余人，组织了十二个河工组，参加者有一百四十三人，为解决吃粮困难，挖河与副业生产也进行了适当结合。夏如庄区龙玉官庄共六十个劳动力，该庄以四十五人挖河，其余十五人往平度、柳沟之间贩粮，每趟每车（每车一人）可赚十五斤到五十斤高粱，相互调剂食用。现该两处工程已有夏庄、顺河、姜庄、河崖等四个区动工，开工后七天中，顺河工程之夏庄段已完成半数。个别村如西傅家庄等，已近完成，胶河工程之河崖段原定二十天完成，按现在之劳动效率估计，可提前五天完工。
