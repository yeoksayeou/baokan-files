(Jizhong News) In some areas of Anxin, Ningjin, and Xian counties, pests such as locusts, cicadas, and aphids were discovered. The democratic government has led the masses to eradicate most of them. In the Macun area of the Third District of Anxin, seven patches of locusts were discovered, which ate a lot of wheat and autumn seedlings. After the local democratic government discovered this, it immediately mobilized more than 400 people from ten villages and eradicated most of them in half a day. More than 20 villages such as Hetou and Xiangjing in the Fourth District of Ningjin discovered cicadas, which severely damaged crops. The district immediately convened village cadres to study methods of capture. One method was to find the insect holes and use water to flush them out for capture, and another was to dig a foot-deep pit at the entrance of the hole, use human manure to block the opening, and suffocate them with smoke. Most of them have now been eradicated. Near Yuntai Mountain in Xian County, aphids have appeared, especially severely affecting cotton. The local promotion agency has helped the masses to try three methods:
    (1) Cold water soaking of tobacco leaves: Use one jin of tobacco leaves to forty jin of water, or one jin of tobacco stems to twenty to thirty jin of water, or one jin of tobacco twigs to fifteen to twenty jin of water. Soak for a day and a night, then remove the tobacco leaves, tobacco stems, and tobacco twigs before use.
    (2) Boiling water soaking of tobacco leaves: First soak one jin of tobacco leaves in five or six jin of boiling water for a day or a night, remove the tobacco leaves, then add sixty jin of water to dilute before use.
    (3) Tobacco leaf lime water: Use six liang of tobacco leaves and ten liang of quicklime, crush the tobacco leaves, place them with the quicklime chunks in a basin, drip a small amount of water to make the lime chunks dissolve and generate heat, then add three or four jin of water, soak for a day and a night, then remove the tobacco leaves and quicklime residue, add water to dilute, the effect is also very good.

　　安新等县扑灭害虫
    【冀中讯】安新、宁晋、献县有些地区发现蝗虫、大眼贼、蜜虫等害虫，民主政府领导群众已大部扑灭。安新三区马村一带，发现蝗虫七片，将麦子及秋苗吃了很多。当地民主政府发现后，立即发动十个村四百多人，半天将其大部扑灭。宁晋四区河头、香井等二十多个村发现大眼贼，吃庄稼很厉害。区里立即召开各村干部研究捕捉办法。一种是发现虫洞，用水将其灌出打捕，一种是在洞口挖一尺深的坑，用人粪把口堵住，将其薰死。现已大部扑灭。献县云台山附近，发生蜜虫，棉花上尤为厉害。当地推进社帮助群众试用三个办法：
    （一）凉水侵烟叶法：用一斤烟叶，对四十斤水，或一斤烟筋，对二十到三十斤水，一斤烟柴，对十五到二十斤水。浸泡一天一夜，捞出烟叶、烟筋、烟干，即可应用。
    （二）开水浸烟叶法：一斤烟叶，先用五、六斤开水浸泡一天或一夜，捞出烟叶后，再对上六十斤水冲稀应用。
    （三）烟叶石灰水：用烟叶六两，生石灰十两，把烟叶揉碎，和生石灰块放在盆里，滴上少量的水，使石灰块化水发热，再加上三、四斤水，泡一天一夜，然后把烟叶和生大灰渣捞出，再加水冲稀，效力也很大。
