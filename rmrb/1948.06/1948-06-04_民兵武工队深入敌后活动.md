　　Militia Guerrilla Units Penetrate Deep Behind Enemy Lines
    [Taihang News] The Anyang wheat protection struggle has begun. On the 14th of last month, more than 100 enemies harassed Xin庄 and 孟村 in our ninth district. Our guerrilla unit met the enemy head-on, beat them back, and wounded two. On the same day, the militia company of our eighth district took the initiative to ambush the area east of Bali店. More than 30 members of the puppet township government entered our ambush circle. The militia calmly and fiercely attacked, killing two enemies. Seeing the situation was bad, the enemy turned around and fled. On the night of the 15th, a small armed force in our eighth district penetrated deep behind enemy lines to sabotage and cut back 140 catties of electric wire. It is reported that the stubborn bandit Liu Lexian's troops began to steal some barley in the area east of Liang Village on the 17th. By the night of the 19th, they had moved to Xin庄 and Haojiadian in our eighth district and robbed more than 20 mu of barley. It is reported that the Anyang enemy is now conducting the second phase of wheat grabbing personnel training. On the 21st, the enemy had already assigned the wheat harvest burden to each village. In the enemy-occupied area, each mu of Dingyang (a unit of land measurement) was assigned 160 catties of wheat, in the guerrilla area each mu of Dingyang was assigned 80 catties, and in our advanced area each mu of Dingyang was assigned 40 catties, and they were trying their best to expand the maintenance villages. From the 23rd, the enemy officially organized wheat grabbing, dividing the Huimen (a religious sect) and the self-defense forces into classes, preparing to move out, and said that Liu bandit Lexian was going to Xiqugou, the 40th Division was going to Shenjiagang, and another main force was sent, attempting to attack our Shuiye. In order to proactively strike the large-scale wheat grabbing by the enemy that is about to come, our Anyang County Command is now ordering all districts to immediately check wheat protection preparations, organize rush harvesting, and strengthen intelligence and reconnaissance work. Now the activities of the border militia and guerrilla units are also gradually strengthening. On the night of the 18th, when more than 50 members of the enemy Liu Lexian's troops arrived in the southwest of Anche Village in our area, they were beaten back by the guerrilla unit of our fifth district, and the enemy suffered three casualties. On the 20th, the Da Zheng joint defense militia figured out the enemy's movement patterns and ambushed east of Da Zheng. More than 30 enemies crossed the river from Henan. With a burst of gunfire from the militia, they killed an enemy captain, and the enemy immediately scurried back with their tails between their legs. The fierce wheat harvest struggle is now unfolding.
