Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 11th: The Shandong Corps Headquarters of the East China People's Liberation Army has just issued Public Communique No. 8, announcing the commencement of the Shandong People's Liberation Army's summer offensive. The communique states: Following the spring offensive from March 11th to May 8th, which swept through most of the Jiaoji Railway, our army launched a powerful summer offensive against the Jinpu Railway's Jinan-Xuzhou section in late May. As of the 5th of this month, we have captured five cities, annihilated two enemy regiments, and controlled over 200 li of railway.

	A unit of our army, on May 27th, routed an enemy regiment of the 84th Division near Zhangqiu, east of Jinan, and seized Zhangqiu in the wake of the victory. Pursuing the enemy fleeing towards Jinan, we captured the Twenty Li Fort and Xindian strongholds northeast of Longshan Station on the 30th, and briefly entered Longshan Station on June 2nd.

	A unit of our army, on May 30th, began fiercely sweeping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's railway defense line between Jinan and Yanzhou (i.e., Ziyang). On the same day, we recovered the cities of Tai'an and Xintai, as well as the stations and strongholds of Jieshou (30 li northwest of Tai'an), Nanliu (30 li south of Tai'an), and Liulangfen (15 li west of Tai'an). On the 31st, we occupied Feicheng County on the west side of the Jinpu Railway, as well as the junction of the Xin (tai)-Wen (Dawenkou) and Jinpu Railways at Dawenkou, and the Nan Yi Station, Loude (50 li north of Sishui), and Luzhuang (10 li west of Tai'an) strongholds south of it. On June 1st, we captured Sishui City. On the 2nd, we recovered Da Wan De Station (80 li south of Jinan). On the 3rd, we continued to occupy the Yao Cun and Wu Sun Cun stations northeast of Yanzhou. In the above actions, we annihilated over 500 enemy soldiers, including the Sishui County Chief (name to be determined). The remaining enemy, fearing annihilation, fled to Jinan, Yanzhou, and other places. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 84th Division Special Service Regiment and the 1st Regiment of the 5th Brigade of the Shandong Provincial Security Force (formerly the 1st General Security Team), who were trapped in Weijiazhuang, 3 li west of Dawenkou, and the Wenhe Railway Bridge. After only one hour of intense fighting, we completely annihilated over 3,000 enemy soldiers. The results of the battle are being verified. As of this point, the entire Jinan-Yanzhou railway line, from Da Wan De in the north to Yao Cun in the south, a distance of over 200 li, is under our control.

	At the same time, another unit of our army launched a fierce assault along the Yanzhou-Xuzhou railway line. On May 31st, we captured the Jiehe Station between Zouxian and Tengxian. On June 2nd, we continued to capture the Liangxiadian (20 li south of Zouxian), Nanshahe (15 li south of Tengxian), and Guanqiao (40 li south of Tengxian) stations, as well as more than ten outposts on the outskirts of Zouxian and Tengxian, annihilating part of the enemy.

	Currently, the Jinpu Railway, the only land transportation artery for the Shandong Chiang Kai-shek troops, and its defense system have been shattered by our army. The Chiang Kai-shek troops are being compressed into isolated cities such as Jinan, Yanzhou, Ningyang, Jining, Tengxian, Zouxian, and Lincheng.

    现山东蒋军唯一陆上输血管津浦线及其防御体系，已被我军打得支离破碎，蒋军正被压缩于济南、兖州、宁阳、济宁、滕县、邹县、临城等孤立城市中。
