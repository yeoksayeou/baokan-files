　　Shijiazhuang News Briefs

　　Bank Loans Support Industry
    With the help of bank loans, industries in Shijiazhuang such as ironworking, leather making, and textiles are developing rapidly. In the half-month from the 6th to the 21st of this month, the bank's overdraft support for the city's iron factories reached 1,455 million yuan (border currency, same below), with 28 new iron factories established. Some factories have already begun manufacturing scales and other items. The sales of various iron products are increasing daily, and weaving machines, cotton gins, etc., have been sold to Hengshui, Nangong, Ding County, Ci County, Handan, Linqing, Dingxiang, and other places. In addition to the more than 40 existing leather factories like Leyixing, which have successively resumed operations after liberation, the leather industry, with the help of the bank, has seen 13 factories, including Longchang, which had ceased operations before liberation, resume work one after another. In addition, 20 new factories such as Guanglu have been established. Currently, there are more than 70 leather factories in the city. Among them, Guanglu alone has made a net profit of more than 7 million yuan from March to June. In order to support cloth factories, the Shijiazhuang branch has loaned 249.5 million yuan to various private weaving factories in the past half month. The loan recipients account for more than 65% of the city's weaving factories. The factories are now experimenting with using local yarn.

　　Production Promotion Society Established
    In order to organize and guide the city's mass production cooperation undertakings, the Shijiazhuang Production Promotion Society was officially established on the 19th of this month. On the same day, relevant departments in the city, as well as district chiefs and district promotion society cadres were convened to report on and study their work. Comrade Mao Duo of the Municipal Party Committee also attended and provided guidance. Regarding the development of urban cooperative undertakings, Comrade Mao Duo pointed out: It is necessary to start from the urban environment and the needs of the masses, overcome the views of bestowing and providing relief, and organize various cooperatives based on the needs and willingness of the masses. Deng Zhaoxiang, director of the Municipal Production Promotion Society, based on the reports from various districts and addressing the existing problems of the cooperatives in Shijiazhuang, proposed a preliminary transformation plan: (1) Cooperatives are run by the masses themselves, and should be democratically managed by the masses themselves. In order to solve the difficulty of funding, in addition to welcoming capital shares, it is called for to create capital through labor and to invest wages as shares. The district promotion society should vigorously support development to make it a truly labor-capital integrated production cooperative. (2) Profit distribution: Those with larger labor shares should receive a larger labor dividend, and those with larger capital shares should receive a larger capital dividend. (3) Cotton weaving cooperatives should have trade union organizations and implement democratic management. The director (or factory director), foreman, and worker representatives should jointly organize a cooperative committee, establish production covenants, improve technology, change the bureaucratic style, and overcome waste. Implement a genuine policy of people-run and government-assisted. (Hong Qun)

　　石家庄零讯
　　银行贷款扶植工业
    石市铁工、制革、纺织等工业，经银行贷款扶助，业务日益发展。自本月六日至二十一日的半月中，银行扶植该市铁工厂透支额达十四亿五千五百万元（边币，下同），新增铁工厂二十八户，某些工厂已开始制造磅秤等物。各种铁业销路日广，织布机、轧花机等已能销至衡水、南宫、定县、磁县、邯郸、临清、定襄等地。制革业除原有乐义兴等四十余家已于解放后相继开工外，由于银行的扶助，解放前已即停业的隆昌等十三家亦先后复工，并又新增广禄等二十家。现全市制革业已达七十余家。其中广禄一家，由三月至六月已获纯利七百余万元。为了扶助布厂，石市分行半月来已贷给各私营织布工厂二亿四千九百五十万元，贷款户占全市织布厂百分之六十五强，各厂现正试验改用土线。
　　生产推进社成立
    为组织与指导全市群众的生产合作事业，石市生产推进社于本月十九日正式成立。当日并召请市内各有关部门及各区长、区推进社干部开会，汇报研究工作。市委毛铎同志亦出席指导。关于开展城市合作事业，毛铎同志指出：必须从城市环境与群众需要出发，要克服恩赐、救济的观点，根据群众的需要与自愿，组织各种各样的合作社。市生产推进社邓兆祥主任根据各区汇报，针对目前石市合作社存在的问题，提出初步改造方案：（一）合作社是群众自己办的，应由群众自己民主管理，为解决资金困难，除欢迎资本股外，号召由劳动创造资本，以工资入股；区推进社应大力扶植发展，使其成为真正劳资合一的生产合作社。（二）分红问题：劳动股大者，劳力分红应大些，资本股大者，资本分红应大些。（三）棉织合作社应有工会组织，实行民主管理。主任（或厂长）、工头、工人代表等，共同组织合作委员会，订立生产公约，提高技术，改变机关化作风，克服浪费现象。执行真正的民办公助方针。（洪群）
