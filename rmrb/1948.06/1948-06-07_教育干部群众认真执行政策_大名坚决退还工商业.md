　　Educate Cadres and the Masses to Conscientiously Implement Policies
  　Daming Resolutely Returns Industry and Commerce
    [Daming News] The masses in Daming City have accepted our Party's policy on industry and commerce. After five days, more than 20 businesses have been returned. During the review last year, due to the leadership's vague understanding of industry and commerce, industry and commerce were struggled against as feudal landlords. After the promulgation of the Land Law, the leadership, in a planned and step-by-step manner, used various methods and meetings to carry out propaganda and education among the citizens. When it was ripe, a short-term training class of forty people (street cadres, community committee members) was convened. First, the leadership examined the past mistakes of struggling against industry and commerce, and that now protecting industry and commerce and returning industry and commerce is for the long-term interests of the citizens. After enlightenment, it was decided to return the industry and commerce struggled against last year to the original owners. They went back to the streets and automatically convened meetings of street cadre group leaders, explained the policies, cleared their thinking, and conducted propaganda and deliberation among the masses. They convened general meetings of shareholders, once again explaining the policies. During the discussion, some said: Anyway, Chairman Mao won't lead us into a pit. Others said: Give it to them and let them operate well. With business in the market, our lives will have something to rely on. On the spot, it was decided to start with South Street first, and the managers of the three long-established brands, Qingyuancheng, Yongxinghao, and Daxingzhai, were invited to be told face to face. The businessmen said excitedly: I never dreamed that the masses would preserve it so well for me. Then, Ruifengxiang, Qingyunzhai, and Fuxinghao were returned on North Street, as well as a rickshaw shop, Sanyihao paper shop on West Street, Zhongtaichang pickle garden, Yihexing pharmacy on East Street, etc. In less than five days, twenty-four businesses were returned in the city, and the return is still in progress.

　　教育干部群众认真执行政策
  　大名坚决退还工商业
    【大名消息】大名市群众接受了我党工商业政策，经过五天，退还了廿多家商号。去年复查时，由于领导上对工商业的认识模糊，就把工商业按封建地主斗争了。土地法颂布后，领导上有计划有步骤的利用各种方式及各种会议，在市民群众中进行了宣传教育，酝酿成熟时，就召开了四十人的（街干小区委员）短期训练班，首先领导上检查过去斗争工商业的错误，现在要保护工商业及退还工商业，正是为了市民的长远利益作打算。经过启发后，决定把去年斗争的工商业退还给原业主。他们回去到街自动召开街干小组长会议，讲明政策，打通思想，分头在群众中宣传酝酿，召开股员大会，再一次的讲明政策。在讨论时有的说：反正毛主席不往坑里领咱，有的说给了人家叫人家好好经营，市面有了买卖，咱的生活也就有了依靠啦。当场就决定首先由南大街开始，就把三个老字号庆元成、永兴号、大兴斋的经理请来，当面交代。商人兴奋的说：群众给我保存的这样好，是我做梦也想不到的事。接着就是北大街退还了瑞丰祥、庆云斋、福兴号，还有家洋车铺，西大街三义号纸店，中泰昌酱菜园，东大街义合兴药栈等，全市不到五天的时间，退还了二十四家商号，现还在退还中。（克光、亚平、韦光）
