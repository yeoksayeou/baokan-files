　　Resolutely Eliminate the "Kerikong" Work Style

　　Wang Shouheng is Not a Landlord, Forcing Someone to Death is Not Confirmed

　　In the March 16th issue of this newspaper, on the first page, was published an article titled "Who Forced My Three Family Members to Death?" The article stated: "Landlord Wang Shouheng forced his child bride to death." He is actually of middle peasant status, and the death was not forced. In order to restore Wang Shouheng's reputation, restore the credibility of the Party newspaper, I expose the following two facts about my own "Kerikong" behavior.

　　(1) When writing this article, due to my personal erroneous thinking of trying to be the first to show off, what I wrote made people feel hatred and indignation towards landlords. As Wang Youbin was telling his story, I was taking notes. When he recounted how Wang Shouheng's family had abused his older sister, who was a child bride, my mind was overwhelmed and I subjectively thought that only a landlord could do such cruel things, preventing a child bride from experiencing the life of a young person. I didn't ask whether Wang Shouheng was a landlord. During editing, I subjectively assumed and definitively labeled him a landlord. At the time, I was afraid that it wouldn't be published in the newspaper, fearing that my efforts would be in vain. I thought the main thing was to accuse the landlord of crimes, not anything else. If I had written Wang Shouheng as a middle peasant according to the true situation, the newspaper might not have published it.

　　(2) The "Wang Shouheng forced his child bride to death" incident was something I misheard. When Wang Youbin was complaining, he said that his sister suffered and endured hardship, and finally died after suffering. At the time, I didn't ask how she died or where she died. I cleverly guessed that she was undoubtedly forced to death by Wang Shouheng's family. Therefore, I definitively added the charge of Wang Shouheng forcing the child bride to death. After the whole article was written, I didn't even read it to Wang Youbin before submitting it to the newspaper.

　　The above-mentioned "Kerikong" phenomenon of subjectively distorting and fabricating facts, I now realize, seriously harmed the Party newspaper, harmed the people, lowered the credibility of the Party newspaper, and at the same time wronged Wang Shouheng, infringed upon the middle peasants, and added to the enemy, which is even more wrong. In addition to publicly exposing and deeply reflecting on myself in the newspaper, I hope everyone will criticize me to transform my erroneous thinking, so that I can deeply understand, and at the same time, I am determined to transform myself and be a good correspondent serving the people.

　　Finally, one point to clarify: The abuse of the child bride in Wang Shouheng's family is a true situation, not an exaggeration. Wang Youbin dares to guarantee this. In order to clarify the truth, we hope that the responsible comrades of Xiakou Village will conduct further in-depth investigations.

　　坚决肃清“客里空”作风
  　王守恒不是地主，逼死人命不确实
    三月十六号本报一版刊登“谁逼死俺三条人命”一稿。文内：“地主王守恒逼死童养媳妇。”系中农成份，并非逼死的。为了恢复王守恒的名誉，恢复党报的威信，揭露我自己以下两点客里空的事实。
    （一）在写这篇稿子时，由于个人抱着抢先出风头的错误思想，写出后令人看了对地主有痛恨愤激之感。当王友彬一面诉，我一面记，诉到王守恒家中虐待童养媳妇（王友彬的姐）时，自己当时脑子一热，主观地认为除非是地主才能作出如此残忍的事情，童养媳过青年人的生活。并没有问清王守恒是否地主。在整理时自己就主观一套，肯定地按上了个地主帽子。当时惟恐不能在报上登载，怕白费心机。认为主要是控诉地主罪恶，而非其它，假若按真实情况将王守恒写成中农成份，报上未必刊登。
    （二）“王守恒逼死童养媳的事”，是个人听错的，王友彬诉苦时，诉他姐熬苦受罪，终于受尽痛苦而死了。当时自己并没去问到底是怎样死去的，死到哪里的？个人自作聪明，嫌其苦中不足，主观猜测到毫无疑问是王守恒家中逼死的。故此也就肯定的加上了个王守恒逼死童养媳的罪名。等到全篇写完后，亦没给王友彬念一念就投到报馆了。
    以上这种客里空主观地歪曲捏造事实的现象，今天认识到严重地损害了党报，损害了人民，降低了党报的威信，同时对王守恒来说是冤枉了的，侵害了中农，增添了敌人，这更加不对。我除了在报上公开揭露痛自反省外，希望大家批判，来改造我的错误思想，叫我深刻的去认识，同时自己有决心改造自己，并愿当个为人民服务的好通讯员。
    最后声明一点：王守恒家中虐待童养媳的事情，是真实情况，并非夸大事实，王友彬敢做保证。我们为了弄清是非，希望峡口村负责同志再作深入调查。
