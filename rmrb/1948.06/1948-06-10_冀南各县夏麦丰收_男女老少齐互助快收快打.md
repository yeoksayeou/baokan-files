　　Jinnan Counties Achieve Summer Wheat Harvest
　　Men, Women, and Children Help Each Other for Quick Harvesting and Threshing

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] This year, Jinnan, Handan, Wei County, Qinghe, Ji County, Hengshui, Xiajin and other counties have achieved a bumper harvest of summer wheat. Generally, a good year sees sixty grains per wheat ear. According to reports from Wei County, this year's wheat ears have around sixty to seventy grains. Zhang Changrong, a farmer from Cui Douwu in Qinghe's first district, put in extra effort, resulting in particularly good crops that matured earliest. He test-threshed four-tenths of an acre of wheat on May 25th, yielding over two sacks, approximately 240 catties. In Handan County, good wheat fields can yield over 200 catties per mu, while poor fields can still yield 120 to 130 catties. Around Xu Guzhai in Wei County, each mu is yielding 30 catties more than last year. Before and during the wheat harvest, various counties resolutely implemented the Border Region Government's proclamation of "whoever plants, harvests," mobilizing men, women, and children to voluntarily help each other harvest the wheat, striving for quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick storage. In Xu Guzhai village of Wei County, more than 30 mutual aid groups were organized. Farmers also allowed landlords who had been purged to voluntarily participate in mutual aid groups. Zhang Laogeng's family of three, a landlord in the village who had never participated in labor before, also joined the mutual aid group, actively harvesting wheat like the farmers. Yu Luoshan, a labor hero from Xisha Gedan village in Ji County's sixth district, promoted mutual aid groups throughout the village. In Pengjia village of Hengshui's second district, women exchanged labor with men. The Xiajin County Committee and County Government instructed all districts to suspend all non-essential war work and meetings unrelated to the wheat harvest. All counties are carrying out the wheat harvest in a planned, arranged, and organized manner, in an orderly fashion. All classes are working intensely and happily, celebrating the harvest.
