    The Baotian team in Ran Family Village, Second District of Feicheng, heroically persists in the struggle against the enemy. Whenever grain-grabbing enemies arrive, they are met with strikes from the Baotian team. Therefore, the enemy sees Ran Family Village as a thorn in their side. On the evening of the twenty-eighth day of the third month of the old lunar calendar, after the villagers had just gone to sleep after dinner, Ran Fanxi, the local thug leader in Feicheng city, led sixty returning corps members and surrounded Ran Family Village in two groups, attempting to wipe out our Baotian team in one fell swoop. As the enemy approached the edge of the village, Zhang Fangxin of the Baotian team discovered them and asked what they were doing. The enemy also asked a question in return. Zhang Fangxin quickly fired at the enemy with his rifle and simultaneously threw a grenade. The enemy dared not advance. Zhang Fangxin moved swiftly to where the militia lived, gathered all the militia members, broke through the enemy's encirclement, and attacked the enemy from the outside. The enemy still thought the Baotian team was gathering in the village, so they took the elementary school (the original gathering place of the militia) as their target and charged from all sides. Upon reaching outside the school gate, the panicked enemies started fighting each other, fighting for a long time before realizing they were all their own people. In this battle, the enemy suffered thirteen casualties (five dead and eight wounded), and finally fled in panic. Our Baotian team smashed the enemy's attack, protected the belongings of the families, and prevented them from being looted by the enemy. The district government immediately commended them and rewarded them with a rifle and thirteen bullets. Now the morale of the militia and the masses is very high, and they are actively organizing joint defense with the masses in nearby villages, preparing to continue fighting the enemy. From this battle, the Baotian team of Ran Family Village gained combat experience, which is to be mobile and flexible in tactics, and not to fight recklessly. Secondly, to achieve victory, it is necessary to constantly raise awareness of the struggle against the enemy and oppose ideological paralysis.

　　冉家庄的保田队
    冀鲁豫一分区武装部
    肥城二区冉家庄的保田队，英勇的坚持着对敌斗争。每当抢粮的敌人到达这里时，都会遭受到保田队的打击。所以敌人视冉家庄为眼中钉。旧历三月二十八日晚饭后，村里的人刚刚睡了觉，肥城城里的土顽头子冉范喜带领着六十名还乡团，分两路向冉家庄包围上来，企图一网打尽我保田队。敌人接近到了村边上，保田队的张芳新发现了敌人，他问干什么的。敌人也反问了一句。张芳新迅速的用步枪向敌人射击，同时打了一个手榴弹。敌人没敢前进。张芳新机动的跑到民兵住的地方，把所有民兵集合起来，冲出敌人的包围，到外线打击敌人。敌人还以为保田队在村里集合着，便以小学（原来民兵集合地）为目标，从四面冲上来。到了校门外，惊慌的敌人自己互相打起来，打了很长时间，才知道都是他们自己的人。这次战斗，敌人死伤十三个人（死五伤八），终于恐慌的急急忙忙逃去了。我保田队粉碎了敌人的进攻，保住了家里的东西，没被敌人抢走，区政府立刻给以表扬，并奖励给他们步枪一支，子弹十三粒。现在民兵与群众的情绪都很高，正积极和附近村庄群众组织联防，准备继续向敌人进行斗争。这次战斗，冉家庄保田队得了战斗经验，就是在战术上要机动灵活，不死硬拼。其次就是要想胜利，必须经常提高对敌斗争的警觉性，反对思想麻痹。
