　　Repelling the Reactionaries' Manufactured Government Crisis
  　Victory for the Finnish People's Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Helsinki Dispatch: The protest movement launched by the Finnish people to counter the reactionaries' conspiracy has come to a victorious conclusion. On May 26th, the Finnish People's Democratic League suggested to the government that it appoint Kilpi, a progressive who recently announced his departure from the Social Democratic Party and the former Minister of Education, as the Minister of the Interior, and appoint Ms. Kuusinen, a leader of the Finnish Communist Party and the wife of Lerno, as a minister without portfolio. This suggestion has been approved by Finnish President Paasikivi. As a result of this change, the proportion of seats for each party in the cabinet is roughly maintained. That evening, the Central Strike Committee ordered the striking workers to return to work, and Kulo, chairman of the People's Democratic League, delivered a radio address to the entire Finnish people, pointing out that the protest movement had ended victoriously. He thanked the working people for their self-sacrificing struggle for the cause of democracy. At the same time, the People's Democratic League issued a declaration exposing the reactionaries' conspiracy, stating: "The aim of the right-wing elements is not only to seize some ministerial seats from the hands of democrats, but also to organize an anti-democratic government." The declaration emphasized the achievements of the Finnish working people, believing that "they have shown their loyalty to democracy and have countered the conspiracies of the right-wing elements." The declaration also stated: "The right-wing elements should remember that what they can do in France, Italy, and other dollar-dominated countries has not and will never succeed in Finland;" the declaration finally called for "the heroic struggle for democracy should develop into a decisive victory in the general election on July 1st and 2nd."

　　反击反动派制造政府危机
  　芬兰人民斗争胜利
    【新华社陕北一日电】赫尔辛基讯：芬兰人民为反击反动派阴谋而掀起的抗议运动，已告胜利结束。上月二十六日，芬兰人民民主联盟向政府建议，任命新近宣布脱离社会民主党的进步分子、原教育部长基尔皮继莱诺为内政部长，并任命莱诺夫人，芬共领导人之一的库西宁女士为不管部长，此一建议已经芬总统巴锡基维批准，此一改变的结果，使内阁各党派的席次比例大致维持原状。当晚中央罢工委员会遂下令罢工工人复工，人民民主联盟主席库洛并向全芬人民发表广播演说，指出抗议运动已胜利结束，他感谢劳动人民为民主事业而作的自我牺牲的斗争。同时，人民民主联盟又发表宣言，揭露反动派的阴谋称：“右冀分子的目的，不仅在从民主人士手中夺去若干部长席位，而且在于组织一个反民主的政府。”宣言强调指出芬兰劳动人民的功绩，认为“他们表示忠于民主，并给了右冀分子的阴谋以反击。”宣言又称：“右冀分子应该牢记，他们在法国、意大利及其他美元统治国家中所能做到的，没有也决不可能在芬兰得到成功；”宣言最后号召“争取民主的英勇斗争，应发展为七月一日和二日的大选中的决定性的胜利。”
