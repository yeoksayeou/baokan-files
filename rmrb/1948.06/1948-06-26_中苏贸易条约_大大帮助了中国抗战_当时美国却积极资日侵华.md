　　Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement
  　Greatly Helped China's Resistance Against Japan
  　At That Time, the United States Actively Funded Japan's Invasion of China
    Commentary by Soviet Scholar Kibanov
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th Dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcasted on the 17th a commemorative article by Kibanov on the ninth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement (note: the agreement was signed on June 16, 1939), analyzing the significant role the agreement played in China's resistance against Japan, and making a clear comparison between the Soviet Union's policy of actively helping China's resistance against Japan and the United States' policy of diligently providing blood transfusions to the Japanese aggressors. The commentary stated:
    June 16th is the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement. The signing of this agreement was of great significance to China. At that time, the Japanese imperialists who were invading China received material assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom. American monopoly capitalists did big business with Japan, helping Japan expand its aggression against China. In 1937, military supplies accounted for 58 percent of the goods the United States imported into Japan, and in 1938, they accounted for 66 percent. In that year, 50 to 56 percent of Japan's imported military supplies came from the United States, and its main suppliers were the following American monopoly organizations: steel trusts, the Morgan Concern, Ford and Rockefeller Syndicates (trusts, concerns, and syndicates are types of monopoly organizations; Morgan, Ford, and Rockefeller are American tycoons). Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese bombers that bombed peaceful Chinese cities used American gasoline, and the bombs were made of "scrap iron" shipped from the United States. When China was in such a difficult situation, the Soviet Union took the lead in assisting China. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement was one of the main forms of this assistance. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union provided China with favorable new loans and increased its supply of arms, aircraft, and gasoline to China. On November 7, 1945, General Feng Yuxiang, in explaining the Soviet Union's assistance to China's anti-Japanese national liberation war, said: When Japanese planes using American gasoline to fuel them were dropping bombs made of American steel on undefended Chinese cities, convoys from the Soviet Union loaded with munitions and volunteer pilots arrived here to help us resist foreign invaders. I personally saw Soviet pilots wounded and dying in Chinese hospitals. The United States sold steel and gasoline to the Japanese, while the Soviet Union shipped medicine to China to treat the wounded bombed by the Japanese.
    The characteristic of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement is that the Soviet Union did not take advantage of China's difficult situation to force China to accept binding conditions, unlike the United States, which in 1946 forced China to conclude an unequal trade treaty (referring to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty). On the contrary, the treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and China was based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for China's sovereignty and independence. The treaty stipulated that in terms of tariffs, import of goods, and the navigation of merchant ships, the development of trade between the two countries should be based on mutually beneficial principles. At that time, China was still subject to the old unequal treaties with Britain, the United States, and France. The Soviet Union took this into account when concluding the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, and specifically stated in this treaty that the Soviet Union did not demand the rights and privileges enjoyed by countries that had concluded unequal treaties with China. In the exchange of notes between the plenipotentiaries of the Soviet Union and China, it was stated: The Soviet Union enjoys no more rights in China than any other country that will conclude an equal treaty with China. The Sino-Soviet Treaty was for a term of three years, but since neither party announced its abolition after the expiration of this effective period, the treaty is still in effect today.

　　中苏贸易条约
  　大大帮助了中国抗战
  　当时美国却积极资日侵华
    苏联·基盘诺夫评论
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】莫斯科电台十七日广播基盘诺夫关于中苏贸易条约九周年（按该约系一九三九年六月十六日签订）的纪念文，分析该条约对于中国抗战所起的重大作用，并将当时苏联积极帮助中国抗战的政策和美国努力为日本侵略者输血的政策作了明确的对比。评论称：
    六月十六日是签署中苏贸易条约的九周年。签署这个条约对中国有极大意义。当时侵略中国的日本帝国主义得到美国和英国方面的物质援助，美国垄断资本家同日本大做其买卖，帮助日本扩张对中国的侵略。一九三七年美国输入日本的货物中军用物资占百分之五十八，一九三八年更占百分之六十六。是年日本从国外输入的军用物资中百分之五十到五十六系来自美国，其主要供给者是下列美国垄断组织：钢铁托辣斯、摩尔根康采恩、福特和洛克菲勒辛迪卡等（托辣斯、康采恩、辛迪卡是垄断组织的种类，摩尔根、福特、洛克菲勒是美国大财阀）。因此毫不奇怪，轰炸中国和平城市的日本轰炸机是用的美国汽油，炸弹是用从美国运来的“废铁”制造的。当中国处在如此困难的情况中时，苏联首先着手援助中国。中苏贸易条约的签订是这种援助的主要方式之一。根据这个条约，苏联给中国有利的新贷款，增加了对中国的军火、飞机、汽油供应。一九四五年十一月七日冯玉祥将军在说明苏联对中国抗日民族解放战争的这种援助时称：当用美国汽油作燃料的日本飞机向中国不设防城市投掷用美国钢铁制造的炸弹时，从苏联装载军火弹药和志愿飞行员的运输队开到了我们这里，帮助我们抵抗外寇。我亲眼看见苏联飞行员因受伤而死亡在中国医院里。美国出卖钢铁和汽油给日本人，而苏联运送药品给中国以便医治为日本人炸伤的伤员。
    中苏贸易条约的特点，在于苏联没有利用中国的艰苦情况，强迫中国接受束缚自己的条件，不象美国那样，在一九四六年强迫中国缔结了不平等的贸易条约（按指蒋美商约），相反的，苏联与中国缔结的条约，是根据平等互惠与尊重中国主权与独立的原则。这个条约规定在关税、货物入口、商船开入海航行方面，都根据互相有利的原则，发展两国的贸易。当时中国还受旧的与英、美、法的不平等条约束缚。苏联在缔结中苏贸易条约时估计到了这点，特别说明在此条约中，苏联不要求那些与中国缔结有不平等条约的各国所享受的权利和特权。在苏联和中国全权代表交换的照会中说：苏联在中国享有不比其他任何国家将与中国缔结平等条约所享有的更多权利。中苏条约以三年为期，可是在这个有效期间完结后，由于双方均未宣布废止，这个条约直到今天还发生效力。
