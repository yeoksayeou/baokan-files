　　Rapid Development of Industry and Commerce
  　Mudanjiang Becomes a Production City
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th] Mudanjiang City, after "absorbing foreign investment to develop industry" and gradually correcting the abnormal commercial prosperity that remained from the enemy and puppet rule and was detrimental to the people's livelihood, now the city's legitimate industry and commerce have been rapidly developed, basically eliminating unemployment and becoming a production city. According to the city government's statistics in April, private industry and commerce alone has reached 4,258 businesses, with 500 more in the process of registration. These private industrial and commercial enterprises include 32 sectors such as ironwork, machinery, textiles, papermaking, leather, lumber, oxygen, matches, glass, rubber, pharmaceuticals, pigments, enamel, caustic soda, batteries, and canned goods, employing over 20,000 workers. Seventy-seven percent of the city's electricity is used for production. Among the various industries, the fastest growing is the iron industry. After "August 15th," there were only two companies, Huachang and Huacheng, but now it has grown to 60 (excluding handicrafts), of which 56 are privately owned and 42 use electricity. They produce water pumps, axles, papermaking machines, cutting machines, spinning machines, cotton gins, drying machines, crushers, and various agricultural implements and train parts. The scale of operation is also larger than before. For example, Tianfa East Iron Works had only 20 people in September last year, producing several hundred catties of work per day, but by May this year, it had increased to 40 people, producing 2,000 catties of iron work. The textile industry had only 23 companies in June last year, but by March this year, it had increased to 198, plus 34 knitting companies, totaling 232, a tenfold increase in less than a year. The finished products are not only supplied to the city and the province, but also sell well in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces. Due to the development of industry, many workers are needed in various industries, and the unemployment phenomenon in the city has been basically eliminated. In the future, the city will focus on vigorously developing the iron industry and mining heavy industries such as coal, iron, and copper, while also developing chemical industries such as papermaking, ceramics, and pharmaceuticals. In terms of commerce and sideline production, the city is also entering a normal state of development. The number of rag merchants (those who buy and sell rags) that used to fill the city is decreasing day by day. Various vendors of daily necessities, vegetables, and food have been organized to join the five major markets. All industries that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood (such as antique dealers) have gradually switched to other industries. In terms of sideline production, the city government encourages the breeding of rabbits, chickens, bees, sheep, and other livestock. At present, there are 17 livestock farms and 5 hatcheries in the city. The hatcheries hatch for four months each year, and during the hatching period, they can produce 30,000 to 50,000 chickens per week. The development of leather and mountain products is also considerable. For example, a certain leather factory produced 7.34 million square feet of pigskin alone from January to March, and the quality is also good. Mountain products include valuable items such as foxes, lynx, pig bristles, bear and tiger skins, and ginseng. In order to vigorously develop industry and commerce, the municipal government has not only promulgated measures to reward inventions, but also plans to organize a natural science association to improve the level of science and technology.

　　工商百业迅速发展
  　牡丹江成生产城市
    【新华社东北二十五日电】牡丹江市经过“吸收外资发展工业”及逐渐纠正了敌伪统治期间残存的与国民生计无益的畸形商业繁荣后，现全市正当工商业已获得迅速发展，基本上消灭了失业现象，成为一个生产的城市。据市府四月份统计，仅私营工商业即已达四千二百五十八家，尚有五百家在登记中。此项私营工商业包括铁工、机械、纺织、造纸、皮革、制材、酸素、火柴、玻璃、胶皮、制药、颜料、珐琅、火碱、电池、罐头等三十二种部门，工人达两万余。全市电力有百分之七十七用于生产。各行业中发展最快的是铁工业，该业在“八一五”后只有华昌、华成两家，现已发展至六十家（手工业除外），其中私营占五十六家，用电力的四十二家，昌产抽水机、车轴、抽水机、造纸机、切杆机、纺线机、打棉机、干造机、粉碎机等及各种农具和火车零件。在经营规模上，亦比前扩大。如天发东铁业，去年九月间只有二十人，每天出几百斤活，至今年五月已增至四十人，出两千斤铁的活。纺织业在去年六月时还只有廿三家，到今年三月就增为一百九十八家，加上三十四家针织业，共为二百卅二家，不到一年就发展了十倍。成品除供应本市本省外，并畅销合江、松江等省。由于工业的发展，各业需要工人众多，市内失业现象已基本消灭。今后该市将以大力发展铁工业及开采煤铁铜矿等重工业，同时并发展化学工业，如造纸、瓷业、制药等。在商业及副业生产方面，该市亦步入正常的发展状态。过去充塞市内的破烂商（买卖破烂货者）日益减少。各种日用品、菜蔬及食品等商贩，均有组织地加入五个大市场中。一切无益于国计民生的行业（如古董商）均陆续转业。副业方面，市府奖励养兔、鸡、蜂，羊等畜养业。现全市共有畜养场十七家，孵化场五个。孵化场每年孵化四个月，在孵化期间每星期能出三万到五万只鸡。皮革、山货等的发展亦甚可观。如某皮革厂自一月至三月间仅猪皮即制出七百卅四万方尺，质量亦佳。山货包括狐狸、猞猁、猪鬃、熊虎皮、人参等贵重物品。为大力发展工商业，市政府除已颁布奖励发明办法条例外，并拟组织自然科学会，以提高科学技术水平。
