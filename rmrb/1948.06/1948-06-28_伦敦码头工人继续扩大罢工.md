　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Reports from various sources: The week-long strike by London dockworkers had, by the 22nd, expanded to approximately 20,000 people, and several thousand cold storage factory workers had also been swept up in the strike wave. Along the 63-mile stretch of the Thames docks, 150 to 200 ships were unable to unload cargo. Dock attendants in Southampton, the largest port in the English Channel southeast of London, telegraphed the London strikers on the 22nd, guaranteeing that they would not handle any ships diverted from London to their location, in support of the London workers' strike. The scabs of the Transport and General Workers' Union are still attempting to divide the striking workers, enticing some workers to return to work. However, "at rallies held at more than a dozen docks, the striking workers booed them off the stage" (Associated Press). Not only that, but more than 4,000 striking workers who gathered in Victoria Park on the 22nd not only demanded that the strike be maintained, but also declared to the scabs that if the scabs threatened them to return to work, they would call on port workers across the country to hold a strike.

　　伦敦码头工人继续扩大罢工
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】各方报导：伦敦码头工人历时一周的罢工，至二十二日止，已扩大到两万人左右，数千名冷藏工厂工人亦卷入了罢工热潮。沿泰晤士河的六十三哩长的码头上，一百五十至两百艘的船只无法卸货。伦敦东南方英吉利海峡中最大商店南安普敦的船坞侍者，二十二日给伦敦罢工工人去电，保证他们不料理自伦敦转赴该地的任何船只，以支持伦敦工人的罢工。运输与各业工人工会的工贼们，仍力图分裂罢工工人，引诱部分工人复工。然而，“在十余处码头所举行的集会上，罢工工人将他们吼下台来”（合众社）。不仅如此，二十二日在维多利亚公园集会的四千多名罢工工人，不但要求坚持罢工，而且向工贼们宣告，如果工贼威胁他们复工，他们就将号召全国的港口工人举行罢工。
