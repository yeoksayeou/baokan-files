　　From Stretcher Team to Combat Team
　　——A Story of Guerrilla Warfare in the Dabie Mountains
　　In a drizzly, dark night in early October of last year, fierce fighting was taking place on the mountains near Popi River, Xinji (now Jingfu) County, Dabie Mountains. Gao Yuji, the stretcher platoon leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Shi Xincheng, the deputy nurse chief, led thirty-six stretcher bearers, twelve nurses, and thirteen messengers and administrative personnel. They received an urgent mission to transfer twenty-two wounded and sick soldiers gathered in Xuwancun village at the foot of the mountain to the rear hospital overnight. However, when they delivered all the wounded and sick to the designated location, the rear hospital had already moved elsewhere due to the emergency. Since they lost contact with the units in front and behind, they decided to operate independently, scouting the situation themselves and fighting guerrillas while carrying the wounded and sick.

　　Under constant enemy encirclement and pursuit, the wounded and sick had no safe place to be安置，and no medicine for treatment. Everyone was worried that the wounds of the seriously injured would become more and more severe day by day. In this extremely difficult situation, the nurses proposed using salt water to wash the wounds and using lard instead of medicine for treatment, which reduced a lot of suffering for the wounded and sick. Whenever the march reached a campsite, they disregarded their own hunger and fatigue and first got something to eat for the wounded and sick. If they couldn't buy anything in the village, they ran to villages several miles away to buy it. If they couldn't borrow a pot, they used pumpkins as pots, adding water and rice inside the pumpkin. When the rice was cooked, the pumpkin was also cooked. The wounded and sick ate rice, and they ate the remaining pot (pumpkin). If there were few houses in the village, they gave the houses to the wounded and sick first, and they slept in the rice fields or built grass sheds, using straw as mats and covers. The enemy was always tracking and tailing them. This aimless long-term transfer march was extremely inconvenient for the seriously wounded and sick. Finally, it was decided to place six seriously wounded and sick in a relatively safe place, and prepare enough rice, flour, oil, and salt for them to eat for a period of time.

　　The days of fighting guerrillas independently had been quite long. The environment required them to continue the fight with more determination and unity. Everyone urgently felt the need for the leadership of the Party to give play to the collective fighting strength. Therefore, Gao Yuji and Wang Menglin, the original branch committee members of the health department, were responsible for convening a general meeting of all Party members to establish a formal branch and elect responsible persons for the branch committee. At the branch meeting, all Party members unanimously expressed their determination to "share life and death, share weal and woe, and persist in the struggle to the end." Soon, they took the initiative to find a certain county party committee to accept the leadership of the local party. With the help and guidance of the county party committee, they established the organization of a combat company, publicly elected Gao Yuji as the company commander, Sang Jinwen as the deputy company commander, Shi Xincheng as the political instructor, and Wang Menglin as the branch secretary and cultural officer. Immediately, enough machine guns and rifles were supplemented, and everyone was armed. A stretcher platoon was transformed into a combat company, becoming a powerful armed force that insisted on guerrilla warfare in the hinterland of the Dabie Mountains. They actively fought in a certain county. In nearly three months of activities, they fought against Chiang Kai-shek bandit security regiments and others seven or eight times, killing more than ten enemies and seizing some weapons. They suffered no casualties. At the same time, under the leadership of the county party committee, they also opened up mass work in one district, organizing a militia team of more than thirty young and strong men, and arming all the militia with the guns seized from the local tyrants. In the course of guerrilla warfare, the troops themselves were also greatly tempered and developed, expanding by more than ten times with new soldiers. The branch also developed many new party members. At the end of February this year, they returned to their original unit with complete equipment and triumphantly. What made them regretful was that the six seriously wounded soldiers who were placed in the local area were not able to return with them. The reason was that when they went to find them, the six comrades had already recovered and all went to do local work, becoming leaders beloved by the local people.

　　担架队变成战斗队
    ——大别山游击战争故事
    去年十月初，一个细雨的深夜，大别山新集（即经扶）县泼皮河附近的山头上，正在进行着激烈的战斗。解放军某部的担架排长高玉基和副看护长史心诚，带领着三十六名担架队员，十二个看护和十三个通讯员及事务人员，接受了紧急任务，把集结在山坡下浒湾村里的二十二个伤病员连夜转送到后方医院去。但当他们把这些伤病员全部送到指定的地方时，后方医院因为情况紧急，已向别处转移了。因他们就和前后的部队失掉了联络，于是他们就决定单独活动，自己侦察情况，抬着伤病员和敌人打游击。
    在敌人不断的包围和追击之下，伤病员既无安全地方可安置，也无医药治疗，大家都很耽心重伤员们的伤口会一天天的严重起来。在这极困难的情况下，看护员们提出了用盐水洗伤口，用猪油代替医药的治疗方法，使伤病员减去了不少的苦痛。每当行军到达宿营地，他们不顾自己的饥饿和疲劳，首先给伤病员搞东西吃，住村买不到，就跑到几里以外的村子去买，借不到锅，他们就把南瓜当锅，在南瓜里面加上水和米。等到米煮熟，南瓜也烧熟了。伤病员吃米饭，他们吃剩下的锅（南瓜）。村子里房子少，先尽伤病员住房子，他们睡在稻田里或搭草棚子，用稻草当垫盖。敌人始终在跟踪尾追着他们，这种无目的的长期转移行军，对重伤病员极不方便，最后决定把六个重伤病员寄放在比较安全的地方，并给准备好足够一个时期吃用的米面和油盐。
    单独活动打游击日子已经不短了，环境要求他们更坚定更团结的继续坚持战斗下去，大家都迫切的感到需要党的领导，以发挥集体的战斗力量，于是由原卫生处支委高玉基和王梦林负责，召开了全体党员大会，建立起正式支部，选出支委会负责人。在支部大会上，全体党员一致表示“同生死，共患难，坚持斗争到底”的决心。不久又主动的去找某某县委，接受地方党的领导。在该县委的帮助指导下，他们建立起战斗连队的组织，公推高玉基为连长，桑金文为副连长，史心诚为政治指导员，王梦林为支书兼文化干事。随即补充了足够的机步枪，全体武装起来了。由一个担架排，变成了一个战斗连，而成为一支坚持大别山腹地游击战争的有力武装。他们积极的在某某县境战斗，就在将近三个月的活动中，先后与蒋匪保安团等作战七八次，毙敌十余名，缴获武器一部，他们毫无伤亡。同时，在县委的领导下，还开辟了一个区的群众工作，组织起一支拥有三十多名青壮年的民兵队，把从土顽手内夺获来的枪支使民兵全部武装起来。而在进行游击战的活动中，部队本身也得到了很大的锻炼和发展，先后扩大了十多倍的新战士。支部也发展了好多新党员。今年二月底，他们武装齐全，胜利地回到原来的部队。使他们遗憾的，是寄放在地方上的那六个重伤员，没有能够和他们一齐回来，原因是当他们去寻找时，那六个同志早已休养好了，全部去作地方工作，而成为当地老百姓所心爱的领导者了。
