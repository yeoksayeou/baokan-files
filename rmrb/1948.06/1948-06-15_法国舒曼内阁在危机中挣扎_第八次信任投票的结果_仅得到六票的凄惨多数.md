Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Comprehensive report: The Schuman cabinet, jointly supported by U.S. imperialism and reactionary parties in the French parliament, has been struggling in its government crisis daily since May 27th. The crisis Schuman is currently facing is not only due to the strong opposition from the French working people, but also due to the conflicts of interest between the various parties in the reactionary government. United Press reported on June 2nd: In view of the increasing blows from all sides, many observers expect the Schuman government to collapse within a week. The main reasons for Schuman's predicament are fourfold: First, the agitation of domestic public opinion caused by Bidault's betrayal of French interests at the six-nation (U.S., Britain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) conference on the West German issue; second, the dissatisfaction caused by the recent retirement of 24 French generals; third, the protests caused by Schuman's May 22nd decree on government funding for certain students of Catholic schools; and fourth, the issue of the government's power to dismiss civil servants. Schuman has not yet dared to submit the first two issues to parliament for debate, the debate on the third issue is also pending, and the fourth issue came to a temporary end after eight days of fierce struggle, due to the Social Party's abandonment of its original position and certain concessions from Schuman.

According to the plan of Meyer at the beginning of the year to dismiss 150,000 government employees, the Schuman authorities demanded that the government have the right to continue to freely dismiss the remaining 30,000 civil servants who have not yet been dismissed. When this request was discussed in the National Assembly's Internal Affairs Committee on May 27th, in addition to the firm opposition from the Communist Party members, it was also opposed by the Socialist Party. This is because Schuman's freedom of dismissal threatened one of the main political bases of the Socialist Party - the positions of conservative senior civil servants. However, this move by the Socialist Party was only to temporarily appease the emotions of the masses. When the National Assembly held a vote on Schuman's request on June 1st and 3rd, only Duclos, the leader of the French Communist parliamentary group, came out to protect the rights and interests of civil servants, strongly criticized the Schuman government's policy, and demanded that the huge military expenditure be reduced instead of dismissing civil servants to balance the budget. Disregarding the strong protests from various organizations of the National Federation of Government Employees, the Socialist Party finally shamefully accepted Schuman's compromise proposal, which stipulated that no more than 15 percent of the government's dismissed civil servants should be senior civil servants, and that they should be given priority in future job changes. "This compromise proposal is actually no different from Schuman's original proposal" (TASS).

On June 4th, the National Assembly held its second (that is, the eighth in the six months of Schuman's administration) vote of confidence on the Schuman government in four days. As a result, 294 voted in favor of confidence and 288 voted against. Schuman's "ability to handle affairs" only obtained a miserable majority of six votes. This result caused a burst of laughter in the parliament.

　　法国舒曼内阁在危机中挣扎
    第八次信任投票的结果　仅得到六票的凄惨多数
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：由美帝及法国议会中反动党派联合支持的舒曼内阁自五月二十七日起旬日以来，每日均在其政府危机中辗转挣扎。舒曼目前身处的危机，不仅由于法国劳动人民对它的强有力地反对，而且由于反动政府各党之间的利害冲突。合众社六月二日电称：鉴于各方面增长的打击，许多观察家预料舒曼政府可能于一周内垮台。使舒曼当局处于危急之主要原因有四：其一是在六国（美、英、法、比、荷、卢）关于西德问题会议上比道尔出卖法国权益所引起的国内舆论的激动；其二是最近二十四名法军将领退休问题所引起的不满；其三是五月二十二日舒曼关于由国库资助天主教会学校某些学生的法令所引起的抗议；其四是关于政府解雇公务员之权力问题。前面两个问题，舒曼尚未敢交付议会辩论，第三个问题的辩论，亦尚有待，而第四个问题则在激烈斗争八天之后，由于社会党背弃其原来立场及舒曼的某些让步而暂告一段落。
    按照年初迈耶解雇十五万政府雇员的计划，舒曼当局要求政府有权继续自由解雇尚未解雇之三万公务员，当这一要求于五月二十七日在国民议会内政委员会上讨论时，除共产党委员坚决反对外，并遭到社会党的反对，这是因为舒曼的自由解雇权威胁到社会党的主要政治基础之一——保守的老资格公务员的职位，但是社会党的这一举措只是为了暂时平息群众的情绪，六月一日和三日在国民议会举行舒曼所要求的投票时，只有法共议会党团领袖杜克洛出来保护公务员的权益，力斥舒曼政府的政策，并要求以削减庞大的军费而不是以解雇公务员来平衡预算。不顾全国政府雇员联盟各组织的强烈抗议，社会党最后可耻地接受了舒曼的折衷案，该案规定政府所解雇之公务员中，老资格公务员不超过百分之十五，并给他们以将来转业的优先权，“这一折衷案实际上与舒曼的原案并无不同”（塔斯社）。
    六月四日国民议会举行四天以来对舒曼政府的第二次（亦即舒曼执政半年来的第八次）信任投票，结果信任者二九四票，反对者二八八票，舒曼的“办事能力”仅得到六票的凄惨多数，此一结果引起议会中的轰然笑声。
