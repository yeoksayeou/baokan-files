　　Chengci County Party Committee Vigorously Leads
　　Post-Wheat Planting Campaign

　　[Chengci News] In Chengci County, a thorough rain fell on June 6th, just as the wheat harvest was about to end. In order to ensure military and civilian food supplies and to avoid leaving an inch of land uncultivated, the County Committee made the following decisions: (1) Leading comrades at all levels should vigorously organize planting work and launch a five-day concentrated planting campaign, striving to plant all existing wheat stubble fields and uncultivated land, leaving no land idle. (2) County-level agencies will dispatch a large number of cadres to various districts to assist in the concentrated planting work. Livestock from all agencies will be made available to the masses. Staff in agencies will be organized to cooperate with village cadres in helping poor households without labor to plant for five days in the area where the agency is located. If the poor households have difficulties, the county government has prepared 10,000 jin of mung beans and some grain seeds, which can be requested from the county. (3) In planting, mutual assistance and exchange of labor should be practiced. The principle of voluntary exchange at equal value, without either party suffering losses, must be implemented. (4) Each district should vigorously promote the elimination of wasteland. Roads impassable to vehicles, as well as land occupied by blockades, ditches, and pillboxes, must be organized for planting. If it is public land, the masses should be informed that whoever plants it will harvest it, without any burden for three years. On the morning of the 10th, the County Committee convened a meeting of cadres drawn from various agencies to participate in the planting work. Comrades Zhang and Yan, the two department heads, made mobilizations and finally called on everyone to "focus on key points, create experience, and promote the general. Not only should we lead the masses to organize concentrated planting, but we must also personally help the masses with planting." Currently, 20 cadres, 9 support staff, and 8 livestock have been dispatched to various districts to help the masses with the concentrated planting work. The planting campaign in the county is rapidly unfolding. (Li Chaoshan, Chen Youran)
