Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: The Union of South Africa, an autonomous dominion of the British Empire, held a general election on May 16. The result of the election was a crushing defeat for Smuts (a major supporter of the British Empire) and his United Party. The pro-Axis during the war and pro-American after the war, Malan, and his coalition National Party, seized power. The new South African cabinet, with Malan as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, was sworn in at Cape Town on June 4. The Moscow Red Star commented on the 6th on this matter: Smuts's defeat is mourned by London, because with his failure, British financial capital, represented by the London financial district, lost a reliable main pillar and is anxious about the fate of its capital in South Africa. The leaders of the United National Party have been talking about South Africa's "independence," but this is just a smokescreen to cover up the true purpose of the Malan faction to expand and consolidate its cooperation with Wall Street. This naturally cannot but cause anxiety in London, because South Africa is not only a source of raw materials for the British Empire, an important market for the export of goods and capital, but also their fortress in Africa and the link between their territories in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Britain, whose policies are tied to the purse strings of the United States by the British ruling class, has proven its inability to resist Wall Street's growing expansion.

    【新华社陕北电】英帝国之自治领南菲联邦于五月十六日举行大选，大选的结果，史末资（英帝国之主要支持者）及其统一党遭受惨败，而由素来反英、战时亲轴心战后亲美的马兰及其联合国民党取得了政权。马兰身任总理兼外交部长的南菲新内阁，已于六月四日在开普敦宣誓就职。莫斯科红星报于六日评论此事称：史末资的失败为伦敦所哀悼，因为随着他的失败，以伦敦金融区为代表的英国财政资本失掉了一个可靠的主要支柱，并且对它在南菲的资本命运感到焦虑。联合国民党的领袖们一直在谈论南非的“独立”，但这只是掩盖马兰派将扩大并巩固其与华尔街合作的真正目的的一种烟幕。这自然不能不引起伦敦的焦虑。因为南非不仅是英帝国原料品的来源，货物与资本输出的重要市场，而且也是它们在非洲的堡垒及其在大西洋和印度洋属地间的联锁。被英国统治阶级的政策系在美国钱袋上的英国，已证明其不能抵抗华尔街日益增长的扩张。
