　　Several Issues Concerning the Rectification of Mutual Aid and the Launching of the Weeding and Thinning Campaign
　　Third Administrative Office of Taihang  Duan Guobao
　　I. Common Problems in Organizations Formed This Year

　　Before spring plowing and sowing this year, the various regions of the Third Administrative Office of Taihang carried out rectification of mutual aid. Many established new democratic work styles in mutual aid groups, ensuring plowing and sowing. However, there were still many problems in the rectification: First, the phenomenon of forcing the masses' thoughts and actions, and forming mutual aid groups in a completely commandist manner, still existed. For those unwilling to participate, they were intimidated under the guise of "enlightening" them: "Why don't you participate in mutual aid? Are you dissatisfied with the call of the Eighth Route Army?" The people of Nanyaogou in Changzhi were afraid of thought reform and dared not refuse mutual aid. After joining, they dared not withdraw from the group, also for fear of thought reform. Second, voluntary in form but compulsory in essence—this was more common. For example, in the Taipei Third Brigade of Licheng, three group leaders were selected first, and everyone was told to join with them. Everyone said their thinking was aligned, but it was actually very forced. This is what is called using cadres as the core to combine mutual aid. Third, abandoning leadership of the voluntary. Proposing to the masses, "It's voluntary! Whoever wants to participate in mutual aid can participate, and if you don't want to, that's fine!" Because of the great harm caused by administrative commandism in the past, this statement actually played the role of "dissolving mutual aid," encouraging evil tendencies and negating the benefits of organization. The old mutual aid was dissolved, and new ones were not formed. For example, in Bayi Village in Changzhi, there are now only three mutual aid groups, and they are not very effective, greatly weakening the power of organization.

　　II. Several Issues to Note in Organizing and Rectifying Mutual Aid

　　First, organize in diverse forms and carry out different mutual aid activities. For example, based on the differences in mountainous areas, plains, and areas with gardens, and the different agricultural activities of spring plowing, sowing, weeding, summer harvest, autumn harvest, and wheat planting, the organizational forms and group sizes should be different. The past practice of unified organization, unified life (such as everyone having to do the same thing today), and even carrying manure in lines under unified commands should be resolutely corrected. Second, the establishment of rules should be based on the demands of the masses. Work measurement, work conversion, and the use of work points should be gradually formulated based on the demands of the masses. At the beginning of mutual aid, the peasants' requirement is to plant the land well for each other. As long as the overall accounting is correct, losses and gains must be clearly stated. Piecework is simple and easy to calculate, and the masses also have this piecework habit, which can be gradually improved later. Not starting from reality and forcibly setting up things like work measurement, work conversion, point recording, land accounting, meetings, reports, etc. (these systems can be used when mass mutual aid has further developed, but they cannot be forced), are considered scientific systems by us, but the masses think they are "too troublesome." After working for two days, the accounts cannot be settled for three days, and they suffer (labor) during the day and burn the midnight oil (in meetings) at night. Third, under forced organization, there is a kind of "official mutual aid group" that is just going through the motions, and there is also a "private mutual aid group." They don't let the cadres know, for fear that they will lead them (in the third district of Changzhi, there are such groups formed outside the official mutual aid groups, with several people working together year-round), because the village's official mutual aid groups have generally become the village's lower-level organizations for everything, substituting for corvée labor, dispatching labor, distributing meals, allocating funds, and collecting grain in meetings and civil schools. This is an old problem, but it has not yet been resolved. Fourth, the wage issue. Labor mutual aid is basically exchanging labor for labor. For timely settlement, an appropriate wage can be set according to the busy and slack seasons and the general local living standards, and appropriate consideration should be given to local sideline profits. Wages earned through mutual aid labor must be cleared at the time of settlement. It cannot be delayed too long, even until autumn. Fifth, production mutual aid is that laborers can combine freely, regardless of class composition. Xiasong in Licheng proposed: "A group doesn't count without poor peasants and farm laborers," and Yuanquan "doesn't allow middle peasants to be group leaders." I think these are all wrong.

　　III. Rectifying Mutual Aid, Organizing Labor, and Launching the Weeding and Thinning Campaign

　　As of the end of May, the 1.6 million mu of autumn land in the Third Administrative Region has been completely sown, and the seedlings are growing well. However, this year's cultivation is generally rough, with little or no fertilizer applied, and no repairs to the field ridges, which will cause great losses in yield. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses to weed more and apply topdressing fertilizer to try to make up for it. This spring, millet is dense and there are many weeds, and most of it is sown in rows. Corn is also in one row, so everything must be weeded. This will make weeding and thinning, summer harvest, and stubble cropping extremely crowded. And our mutual aid groups are in the unhealthy state mentioned earlier. Using this organizational foundation to adapt to this busy weeding and thinning campaign is a very arduous organizational task that requires leaders at all levels to pay great attention and make great efforts to promote and help.

### 整顿互助开展锄苗运动的几个问题

　　整顿互助开展锄苗运动的几个问题
    三专署  段国宝
    一、今年组织起来的通病
    太行三专署各地在春耕下种之前，都进行了整顿互助。不少在互助组中树立了新的民主作风，保证耕地下种，但在整顿中仍有不少毛病：一、强制群众思想与行动，完全命令式编制互助组的现象，仍然存在。对不愿参加者，则以打通思想为借口，予以威吓：“你为什么不互助？是不满意八路军的号召？”长治南窑沟老百姓怕打思想不敢不互助，参加了互助，就不敢提出退组，也是怕打他的思想。二、自愿的形式强制的实质，这是较为普遍的。如黎城台北三大队整顿时先选了三个组长，让大家去和他们结合，大家说是思想通了，实际上很勉强。这就是所谓以干部为核心去结合互助。三、放弃领导的自愿，向群众提出“自愿哩！谁想互助就互助，不愿就算啦！”由于过去行政命令作风对于群众有极大危害，这样的提法就起了“解散互助”的实际作用，助长了邪气，把组织起来的好处否定了，旧的互助解散了，新的没有结合起。如长治八义村现在只有三个互助，还不很起作用，大大减弱了组织起来的力量。
    二、组织与整顿互助中应注意的几个问题
    一、不拘形式的组织起来，进行不同的互助活动。如根据山地，平地以及有园子等地区的不同春耕、下种、锄苗、夏收、秋收、种麦等农时活动的不同，组织形式与组的大小就应有所分别。过去的统一编制，统一生活（如今天都得去做什么）甚至担大粪也要排着队在统一的口令下一齐起身，这种严重的行政命令作风，应坚决纠正。二、订立制度要根据群众的要求，计工、折工、使用工票等要根据群众要求逐渐制定，在互助开始，农民要求是互相种好地，只要大帐不错就行，吃亏便宜都要说到明处，打拨工简单好算帐，群众也有这种打拨习惯，以后可以逐渐提高。不从实际出发，强定些计工、折工、记分活折、地头算帐、会议、会报等等（在群众互助有进一步发展这些制度可以有，但不能强用），在我们说是科学制度，在群众则认为“麻烦圪”，做了两天活，三天算不清帐，白天受（劳动）了一天，黑夜熬油熬眼（开会）。三、在强迫编制下有一种应公事的“公互助组”，同时也有一种“私互助组”，他们不让干部知道，怕去把他们领导起来（长治三区就有这种组是在公互助组之外，另外组织起几个人，长年一块干活），因为村里的公互助组一般都成了村里下层的一揽子组织，代耕支差，派饭派款收粮的会上民校都找这个组。这是个老问题，但至今尚未解决。四、工资问题，劳动互助基本上是工变工，为及时的结帐方便，可根据农时季节的忙闲，和当地一般的生活水平，规定适当的工资，并适当照顾当地的副业利润。互助劳动赚到工资必须在结帐时清理。不能拖的太长以至到秋后一块算。五、生产互助是劳动者都可自由结合，不能论成份，黎城下宋提出：“没有贫雇不算组，”源泉“不让中农当组长”，我以为这都是错误的。
    三、整顿互助、组织劳力、开展锄苗运动
    截止五月底止，三专区一百六十万亩秋地，已完全下种，小苗长的很齐楚，但今年的耕作普遍粗糙，少上肥甚有不上肥，不修边堰，对产量将有很大损失，因而必须发动与组织群众，多锄上追肥，设法补救。今春谷子稠草又多，而且多是一耧种的，玉茭也是一茬，要锄就都得锄，这样锄苗夏收改茬将要挤的不可开交。而我们互助组又处于如前述的不健康状态，以此组织基础来适应这一繁忙锄苗运动，是一件非常艰巨的组织工作，需要各级领导以极大的注意和努力来推动帮助。
