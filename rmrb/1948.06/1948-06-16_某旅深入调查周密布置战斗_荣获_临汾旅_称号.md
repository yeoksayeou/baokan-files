Taiyue, 14th Telegram: In the liberation of Linfen, a certain brigade of the 50th Unit was awarded the glorious title of "Linfen Brigade." The "Linfen Brigade" demonstrated the following characteristics in this operation: (1) Thorough planning, meticulous organization, clear guidance, and specific division of labor. Leaders at all levels personally observed the terrain and understood the situation in each battle. For example, in this operation, brigade and regimental leaders personally observed the terrain to arrange artillery fire and indicate targets. Another example is when platoon leader Hu Hongxi personally observed the terrain and understood the enemy's retreat route before the battle at Xiaodongmen, East Gate, and then promptly directed machine-gun fire to block the enemy, compressing them into the city gate cave and annihilating them all. (2) Coordinated actions of infantry, artillery, and engineers, so that fire cover, engineer blasting, and small-group assaults were well integrated and implemented throughout the entire process of clearing the periphery, defending tunnels, and assaulting the city. (3) Fierce attack and charge. In the past, they only knew how to charge fiercely but were not good at fierce fighting. This time, they were not only able to charge fiercely through the smoke after the explosives went off, but also, once they were on the city wall, they could immediately organize short bursts of fire, shooting fiercely to overwhelm the enemy's resistance, and achieve in-depth development. (4) Resourceful and tenacious. When attacking position 103, a squad charged fiercely, and although casualties were heavy, they still persisted until follow-up troops went up to occupy the position. Another example is Lu Kejian, who used his own ingenuity to capture the guns of a whole company. (5) Observance of discipline and policies. In terms of urban discipline, they achieved complete non-violation. (6) Active political life of the soldiers. The brigade and regiment constantly printed soldier leaflets. Soldiers put out blackboards in the trenches, practiced shouting, performed short plays, read newspapers and leaflets, held discussions, and performed clapper talks. They not only used this method to enliven the life of the troops, but also introduced working methods and combat experience, dispelled ideological concerns, and therefore maintained high morale and active life throughout. The soldiers were all very happy to accept arduous tasks and very happy to study methods.

　　某旅深入调查周密布置战斗
  　荣获“临汾旅”称号
    【太岳十四日电】解放临汾战役中，五零部某旅荣获“临汾旅”的光荣称号。“临汾旅”在这次作战中，表现着以下几个特点：（一）计划周到，组织细心，指导明确，分工具体。各级领导在每次战斗中，都是亲自观察地形了解情况。如在这次旅团首长亲自观察地形布置炮火，指示目标。又如排长胡红喜在东关小东门战斗前，亲自观察地形，了解敌人的退路以后，又及时的指挥机枪封锁，把敌人压缩在城门洞里，全部歼灭。（二）步炮工兵协同动作，使火力掩护、工兵爆破、小组突击很好的结合起来，贯彻在扫清外围、保卫坑道、登城战斗的整个过程中。（三）猛打猛冲。过去只会猛冲不善猛打，这次战役不但能在炸药一响就冒着烟雾猛冲上去，并且一上了城，马上就能组织短促火力，猛烈射击，压倒敌人的抵抗，达到向纵深发展。（四）机智顽强。在攻占一零三阵地时，一个班猛冲上去，虽然伤亡很大，但仍坚持到后续部队上去占住阵地。又如卢克俭运用自己智谋，一人缴了一个连的枪。（五）遵守纪律政策。在城市纪律上做到了全体秋毫无犯。（六）活跃的战士政治生活。旅团不断的编印战士传单，战士们在战壕里出黑板报，演习喊话，演小剧，读报读传单，开讨论会，说快板等。他们不但用这种方式活跃了部队的生活，还介绍了工作方法和战斗经验，解除了思想顾虑，因此始终士气饱满，生活活跃。战士们都是很愉快的接受艰巨的任务，很愉快的研究办法。
