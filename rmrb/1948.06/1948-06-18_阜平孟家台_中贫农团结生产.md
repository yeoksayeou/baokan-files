　　Fuping, Mengjiatai
  　Middle and Poor Peasants Unite for Production
    [North Yue News] In Mengjiatai Village, Fuping's Seventh District, middle and poor peasants are united in boosting production. When the land redistribution began, the village focused on uniting with the middle peasants. At that time, some middle peasants did not fully understand the policy and were afraid of struggle and being forced to offer up their belongings. For example, Liu Futai and three other households handed over 700 catties of grain, and Wang Deyou and three other households offered three cows, one donkey, and four sheep. After discussion by the poor peasant association, it was decided that the middle peasants were still people and all the grain and livestock were returned, dispelling the middle peasants' concerns. During the land distribution, since the land in the village was basically already evenly distributed, an adjustment method was adopted. Land was taken from the middle peasants through consultation. For example, Sun Jiarong was willing to give up a mu of dry land because he had little irrigated land, and wealthy middle peasant Wu Ke Rang was willing to leave his melon field for growing vegetables. This was agreed upon after discussion by everyone. After the completion of the extraction and supplementation, in order to solve the shortage of agricultural tools, the representatives organized blacksmiths Zhi Zongyuan and Li Guoxing to jointly establish a blacksmith's shop to manufacture agricultural tools. More than 50 catties of steel and more than 500 catties of coal were extracted from the accumulated undistributed fruits to support them. A total of one hundred and ten agricultural tools were repaired and manufactured. In order to increase fertilizer, the sheep from the accumulated undistributed fruits and the village's own sheep, totaling 500, were organized. Based on the land distribution situation (many small plots), they were divided into two lying-down areas to rotate the land. Whoever's land they lie on, eats their food, and mutual borrowing is implemented if there is a shortage of food. When lying on the land, the military dependents are allowed to lie down first. Sixty mu of land have already been covered. All nineteen military dependents in the village had their twenty-two mu of land entirely farmed by seventy-five militiamen for the six impoverished and labor-lacking military families. Temporary farming was implemented for eight military dependents. The villagers gathered 53,200 catties of firewood for the military dependents, solving their year-round firewood shortage. The production of the families of the militiamen on the expedition was organized by fourteen work-sharing groups based on natural villages, with the emancipated peasants as the backbone, implementing work-sharing mutual aid. As various difficulties were appropriately resolved, production efficiency was greatly improved, and sowing was completed earlier this year than last year. There are two large canals in the village. Due to insufficient water, the masses often fought for irrigation. This year, seven groups were formed based on the distance of the land from the water, and water was used in rotation by group, fairly and reasonably, and everyone was very satisfied. Before the Qingming Festival, a tree planting campaign was launched in the village, planting a total of 730 trees (including 200 fruit trees). In order to prevent flash floods from damaging crops, the two slopes of Dayubei and Xiaoxigou were designated as restricted mountain forests to increase production. After the land reform, women's awareness has been raised, and they are actively supporting the front lines, rushing to make military shoes, completing 95 pairs in half a month. Eighteen young and middle-aged women participated in agricultural production, and Su Derong's farming, planting, and weeding were no less than that of men. Forty children gathered firewood, allowing adults to free up time to go to the fields for production. Zhang Erzui and Erdanzi each stored more than 3,000 catties of firewood, in addition to providing for burning. After the land was planted, the peasants seized the gap to develop side occupations. There were five families doing small business, twelve families running transportation and sales, and two families playing the bamboo clapper, all of whom were mobilized. Xu Xianglin has already made a profit of 300,000 yuan, solving the problem of salt and cloth for his four family members. In addition, 50 people are helping the public with transportation, earning a profit of up to 2 million yuan. (Wang Xiaomin)

　　阜平孟家台
  　中贫农团结生产
    【北岳讯】阜平七区孟家台中贫农团结闹生产。该村在平分开始时注意团结中农，当时有的中农对政策了解不够，害怕斗争献东西，如刘福太等三户缴出粮食七○○斤，王德有等三户献出牛三头、驴一头、羊四只。经贫农团讨论，认为中农是人，把粮食牲畜全部退回，打破了中农顾虑。在分地时，因该村土地基本上已平分，就采取了调剂方法。对中农抽地采用商量办法，如孙家荣因水地少愿让出亩旱地，富裕中农吴克让愿把瓜地留下吃菜，经大家讨论后同意了。完成抽补后，为解决农具困难，代表会即组织铁匠智宗元、李国兴二人，合伙成立铁匠炉制造农具。从积存未分的果实中抽出钢铁五十余斤，石炭五○○斤予以扶植，共修补和制造农具百十来件。为增加肥料，又将积存未分的果实中的羊及村中门羊组织起五○○只，按土地分散情况（小块地多），分成两个卧场轮流卧地。给谁家卧吃谁家饭，缺吃的即实行互借。卧地时让军工属先卧，现已卧六十余亩。全村十九户军工属，由民兵七五人给六家贫苦无劳力的军属全部包耕地二十二亩。八家军工属实行临时代耕。全村群众给军工属打柴五万三千二百斤，解决了全年烧柴困难。远征民兵家的生产是以翻身农民为骨干，按自然村组织了十四个拨工组，实行拨工互助。由于各种困难得到适当解决，生产效力大大提高，今年比去年提前完成播种。该村有两道大渠，因水不足，群众为浇地当常争斗，今年按地离水远近组成七个组，按组轮流使水，公平合理，大家都很满意。清明节前全村掀起植树运动，共植树七百三十棵（内果木树二百棵）。为防止天捞冲坏庄稼，将大玉背、小西沟两片坡作为禁山林以利增加生产。经过土改后妇女认识提高，积极支前，赶作军鞋，半月即完成九十五双。十八个青壮年妇女参加农业生产，苏德荣耕、种、锄比男子不在以下。四十个儿童打柴，让大人腾出空儿下地生产，张二嘴二旦子除供烧外，各存柴三千余斤。地里种好后，农民即抓住空隙开展副业，计有五家做小买卖的、十二家跑运销的、二家打的都动起来。许相林已获利三十余万元，解决家中四口人的吃盐穿布困难。另有五十个人给公家帮工运输，已获利达二百万元。　（王孝民）
