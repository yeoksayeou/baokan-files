　　Yanglou Masses Discuss Methods
  　Ensuring No Disruption to Both War Support and Production
    [News from Ji-Lu-Yu] Henan General Branch News: In Yanglou, Nanwang District, a mass meeting was held to discuss the integration of war support and production. The stretcher-bearer team first raised the issue: who should do the substitute plowing and who shouldn't. Then everyone discussed and evaluated. The standard for evaluation was mainly based on whether there was anyone else at home to work after he left to carry the stretcher. This time, Hou Yanglou planned to send twenty-five people to carry stretchers, and everyone evaluated that fifteen families could have their plowing done by others. After the evaluation, it became clear which families would help with the work at home after he left, so that he could participate in the war with peace of mind. Generally, four or five families were responsible for helping one family. After this problem was solved, someone raised another question: "He's gone out to carry a stretcher, and we're at home helping him harvest wheat. Does his family still provide meals and water?" After discussion, it was decided that those who provided it before would continue to do so, because he didn't eat the family's grain when he went out to carry the stretcher. After the meeting, everyone said: Although people left to support the war effort, the work at home won't be delayed. Now we can rest assured.

　　杨楼群众讨论办法
  　战勤生产两不误
    【冀鲁豫消息】河南总支社消息：南旺一区杨楼，开群众大会，讨论战勤生产结合问题。担架班首先提出来：谁该代耕，谁不该代耕，然后大家评议。评议的标准，主要是看他出担架走后，家里还有没有人干活。这次后杨楼准备出二十五个人抬担架，大家评议有十五家可以代耕。评议后就明确起来，他走后，家里的活那几家帮助，使他出去后可放心参战。一般的是四、五家负责帮助一家。这问题解决后，又有人提出来：“他出去抬担架啦，咱在家给他割麦子，他家里是不是还管饭吃，管水喝。”大家酝酿后，决定管起的还是管，因为他出去抬担架，也没有吃家里的粮食。会后，大家说：虽然出战勤走了，家里活也误不了，这一下可放心了。
