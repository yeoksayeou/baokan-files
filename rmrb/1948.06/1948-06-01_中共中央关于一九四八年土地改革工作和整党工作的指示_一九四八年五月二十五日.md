Instructions of the CCP Central Committee on Land Reform and Party Rectification Work in 1948
May 25, 1948

(I)
　　Attention must be paid to the season. The entire autumn and winter of this year, i.e., a total of seven months from September this year to March next year, must be used to complete the following in sequence within the areas designated by each Central Bureau and Sub-Bureau: (A) Investigation of rural conditions. (B) Implementing preliminary party rectification according to correct policies. The work teams or work groups sent by the higher authorities to the villages must first unite all the activists and better elements within the local party branch organization and jointly lead the local land reform work. (C) Organize or reorganize or enrich the Poor Peasants' League and the Farmers' Association, and launch the land reform struggle. (D) Classify class components according to correct standards. (E) Implement the distribution of feudal land and feudal property in accordance with correct policies. The final result of the distribution must make all major classes feel fair and reasonable, and the landlord class also feels that there is a way out and a guarantee for their livelihood. (F) Establish township (village), district, and county-level people's representative conferences, and elect three-level government committees. (G) Issue land certificates and determine land rights. (H) Adjust or revise the standards for agricultural tax (public grain) burden. This standard must adhere to the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, that is, on the one hand, it is conducive to supporting the war; on the other hand, it enables farmers to have the interest to restore and develop production and is conducive to improving farmers' lives. (I) Complete the reorganization of the party branch organization in accordance with correct policies. (J) Shift the focus of work from land reform to uniting all working people in rural areas and organizing the labor force of landlords and rich peasants to strive for the common restoration and development of agricultural production. Start organizing small-scale labor exchange organizations and other cooperative groups based on the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange; prepare seeds, fertilizers, and fuel; make production plans; issue necessary and possible agricultural loans (mainly for production materials, which must be borrowed and repaid, strictly distinguishing them from relief funds); and, where possible, make plans for water conservancy projects. The above is the entire work process from land reform to production. All comrades directly engaged in land reform work must understand this work process, avoid one-sidedness in work, and complete the above work in the autumn and winter seasons without missing the opportunity.

(II)
　　In order to achieve the above objectives, the following must be completed in the three months from June to August this year: (A) Delineate the scope of land reform work. This scope must be delineated under the following three conditions. First, all enemy armed forces in the local area have been completely eliminated, and the environment has been stabilized, rather than being a turbulent guerrilla area. Second, the absolute majority of the local basic masses (farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants) already have the demand for land distribution, not just a few people. Third, the party's land reform work cadres are in sufficient quantity and quality to control the local land reform work, rather than allowing the spontaneous activities of the masses. If any of the above three conditions are not met in a certain area, the area should not be included in the scope of land reform work in 1948. For example, in the areas bordering the enemy in the North China, East China, Northeast, and Northwest Liberated Areas, and in the vast majority of areas in the Jianghuai and Hanhai areas under the Central Plains Bureau, the first condition is not yet met, so they should not be included in this year's land reform plan. Whether to include them next year will depend on the situation. In these areas, we should make full use of the experience during the Anti-Japanese War to implement social policies of rent reduction and interest reduction and appropriate adjustment of seeds and food rations and rational burden of financial policies, so as to unite or neutralize all possible social forces, help the People's Liberation Army eliminate all Kuomintang armed forces, and crack down on the most politically reactionary local bullies. In these areas, do not distribute land or windfall wealth, because under the conditions of the new areas and areas bordering the enemy, these are not conducive to uniting or neutralizing all possible social forces to complete the basic task of eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries. (B) Hold good cadre meetings. In 1948, for the cadre meetings on land reform and party rectification, we must fully explain all the correct policies on land reform and party rectification, and distinguish between what is permissible and what is not. All important documents promulgated by the Central Committee must be assigned to all cadres engaged in land reform work and party rectification work to study carefully, fully understand, and be required to fully comply with them, and no unauthorized modifications are allowed. If there are parts that are not suitable for the local situation, opinions for modification can and should be put forward, but they can only be implemented after obtaining the consent of the Central Committee. The cadre meetings at all levels this year must be fully and appropriately prepared by the local high-level leading organs before the meeting. That is, a few people should discuss in advance (with one person taking the main responsibility), raise questions and analyze questions. Write a well-written outline, carefully consider the content and wording of this outline (pay attention to being concise and to the point, oppose aimless long speeches), then report to the cadre meeting, conduct discussions, absorb the opinions in the discussions, supplement and modify them, and use them as a conclusion, and notify the whole party of this document and publish it publicly in newspapers as much as possible. We must oppose the method of empiricism, that is, without any preparation in advance, without raising questions, without analyzing questions, without making a well-prepared report with well-considered content and wording to the cadre meeting, but allowing the attendees to have aimless and disorganized discussions, resulting in the extension of the meeting time and the failure to obtain a clear and thorough conclusion. If there is such a harmful empirical method in the leadership work of the Central Bureau, Central Sub-Bureau, District Party Committee, Provincial Party Committee, and Prefectural Party Committee, we must pay attention to overcoming it. The number of people in meetings discussing policies should not be too many. As long as there is good preparation in advance, the meeting time can also be shortened. Approximately, depending on the situation, it is appropriate to have a meeting of a dozen people, or twenty or thirty people, or forty or fifty people for about a week. The number of people in meetings conveying policies can be larger, and the time should not be too long. Only high-level and mid-level cadre meetings of party rectification nature can have more people and longer time. (C) In the first half of September, or at the latest in the second half of September, all cadres directly engaged in land reform work must arrive in the countryside and start work, otherwise they will not be able to use the entire time of autumn and winter to complete all land reform work and party building and government building work, and prepare for spring plowing.

(III)
　　In cadre meetings and in work, cadres must be educated to be good at analyzing specific situations, and to decide on the local tasks and methods of work at that time based on the specific situations of different regions and different historical conditions. It is necessary to distinguish between the differences between urban and rural areas, and it is necessary to distinguish between the differences between old areas, semi-old areas, areas bordering the enemy, and new areas, otherwise mistakes will be made.

(IV)
　　Where the feudal system has been fundamentally eliminated, and the poor peasants and farm laborers have obtained land that is roughly equivalent to the average, and the land owned by them and the middle peasants is similar despite the differences (which are permissible), it should be considered that the land problem has been solved, and the issue of land reform should not be raised again. The central task in these areas is to restore and develop production, complete party building and government building work, and support the front lines. In some villages in these areas, if there is still land to be distributed or adjusted, class components to be revised, and land certificates to be issued, these tasks should naturally be completed according to the actual situation.

(V)
　　In all liberated areas, whether in areas where land reform has been completed or in areas where land reform has not been completed, it is necessary to guide rural people to cultivate wheat fields and carry out some autumn plowing of land this autumn. In winter, all rural people should be called upon to accumulate fertilizer. All of these are of great importance to agricultural production and harvest in 1949, and must be resolved with administrative force in coordination with mass work.

(VI)
　　We must resolutely overcome certain undisciplined or anarchic states that exist in many places. That is, arbitrarily modifying the policies and strategies of the Central Committee or higher authorities, and implementing extremely harmful policies and strategies that they think are right but violate unified will and unified discipline; under the pretext of being busy with work, adopting the erroneous attitude of not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards, and regarding the places they manage as if they were independent countries. This state of affairs has caused enormous damage to the interests of the revolution. Party committees at all levels must repeatedly discuss this point and earnestly overcome this undisciplined or anarchic state, and concentrate all possible and necessary powers in the Central Committee and its representative organs.

(VII)
　　The Central Committee, Central Bureau (Sub-Bureau), District Party Committee (Provincial Party Committee), Prefectural Party Committee, County Party Committee, District Party Committee, and even the branch must make full use of communication methods such as radio, telephone, telegraph, mail, and special delivery, meeting methods such as small meetings (for example, four or five people), regional meetings (for example, several counties), and individual talks, inspection methods of small inspection groups (for example, three to five people) and individual prestigious committee members, and at the same time make full use of news agencies and newspapers to closely connect with each other, grasp the dynamics of the movement, exchange information at any time, exchange experiences, promptly correct mistakes, and promote achievements. Do not wait for several months, or half a year, or even longer, before the lower levels make summary reports to the higher levels, and the higher levels make general instructions to the lower levels. These reports and instructions are often outdated and ineffective, or their effectiveness is reduced. Mistakes have already been made, and it is too late to correct them, and the loss is too great. What the whole party urgently needs are timely, vivid, and concrete reports and instructions.

(VIII)
　　Urban work and rural work, industrial production tasks and agricultural production tasks must be placed in the appropriate positions in the leadership work of the Central Bureau, Sub-Bureau, District Party Committee, Provincial Party Committee, Prefectural Party Committee, and Municipal Party Committee. That is to say, do not neglect or relax the leadership of urban work and industrial production work because of leading land reform work and agricultural production work. We now have many large, medium, and small cities, and a wide range of industrial, mining, and transportation work. If the important leading organs neglect or relax this aspect of work, we will make mistakes.

　　中共中央关于一九四八年土地改革工作和整党工作的指示
    一九四八年五月二十五日
    （壹）
    必须注意季节。必须利用今年整个秋季及冬季，即自今年九月至明年三月，共七个月时间，在各中央局及分局所划定的地区内，依次完成：（甲）乡村情况调查。（乙）按照正确政策实行初步整党。上级派到乡村的工作团或工作组，必须首先团结当地党的支部组织内的一切积极分子和较好分子，共同领导当地的土地改革工作。（丙）组织或改组或充实贫农团和农会，发动土地改革斗争。（丁）按照正确标准，划分阶级成份。（戊）按照正确政策，实行分配封建土地及封建财产。实行分配的最后结果，必须使一切主要阶层都感觉公道和合乎情理，地主阶级亦感觉生活有出路，有保障。（己）建立乡（村）、区、县三级人民代表会议，并选举三级政府委员会。（庚）发给土地证，确定地权。（辛）调整或改订农业税（公粮）负担的标准。这种标准，必须遵守公私兼顾的原则，这即是一方面利于支援战争；一方面使农民有恢复和发展生产的兴趣，利于改善农民的生活。（壬）按照正确政策，完成党的支部组织的整理工作。（癸）将工作方向由土地改革方面，转移到团结农村中一切劳动人民并组织地主富农的劳动力为共同恢复和发展农业生产而奋斗的方面去。开始组织在自愿和等价交换两项原则上的小规模的变工组织和其他合作团体；准备好种籽、肥料和燃料；做好生产计划；发放必要的和可能的农业贷款（以贷给生产资料为主，必须有借有还，严格区别于救济性质的赈款）；在可能的地点，做好兴修水利的计划。以上是由土改到生产的全部工作过程，必须使一切直接从事土改工作的同志了解这样的工作过程，避免工作的片面性，并不失时机于秋冬两季全部完成上述工作。
    （贰）
    为达上述目的，今年六月至八月的三个月内，必须完成：（甲）划定土改工作范围。这种范围，必须是在下列三项条件下划定之。第一、当地一切敌人武装力量业已全部消灭，环境业已安定，而非动荡不定的游击区域。第二、当地基本群众（雇农、贫农、中农）的绝对大多数业已有了分配土地的要求，而不只是少数人有此要求。第三、党的土改工作干部在数量上和质量上，已能掌握当地的土改工作，而非听任群众的自发活动。如果某一地区，在上述三个条件中，有任何一个条件不具备，即不应当将该地区列入一九四八年土改工作的范围。例如，在华北、华东、东北、西北各解放区的接敌区域，及中原局所属江淮河汉区域的绝大部分地区，因为尚不具备第一个条件，即不应当列入今年的土改计划内。明年是否列入，还要看情况才能决定。在这类地区，应当充分利用抗日时期的经验，实行减租减息及酌量调剂种籽吃粮的社会政策和合理负担的财政政策，以便联合或中立一切可能联合或中立的社会力量，帮助人民解放军消灭一切国民党武装力量及打击政治上最反动的恶霸分子。在这类地区，既不要分土地，也不要分浮财，因为这些都是在新区和接敌区的条件之下，不利于联合或中立一切可能的社会力量完成消灭国民党反动力量这一基本任务的。（乙）开好干部会议。一九四八年，为着土改和整党的干部会议，必须充分讲明关于土改和整党的全部正确政策，将许可做的事和不许可做的事，分清界限。必须将中央颁布的各项重要文件，责成一切从事土改工作和整党工作的干部，认真学习，完全了解，并责成他们全部遵守，不许擅自修改。如有不适合当地情况的部分，可以和应当提出修改的意见，但必须取得中央同意，方能实行修改。今年的各级干部会议，必须由各地高级领导机关，在开会之前，有充分而恰当的准备。这即是事前由少数人商量（由一个人负主责），提出问题和分析问题。写好成文的纲要，精心斟酌这个纲要的内容和文字（注意简明扼要，反对不着边际的长篇大论），然后向干部会议作报告，开展讨论，吸收讨论中的意见，加以补充和修改，作为定论，并将此项文件通知全党及尽可能在报纸上公开发表。必须反对经验主义的方法，这即是事前毫无准备，不提出问题，不分析问题，不向干部会议作精心准备好了的内容文字都有斟酌的报告，而听凭到会人员无目的的杂乱无章的议论，致使会议时间延长，得不到明确而周密的结论。各中央局、中央分局、区党委、省委及地委的领导工作中，如果存在着这种有害的经验主义方法，必须注意克服。讨论政策的会议，人数不可太多，只要事先有良好准备，会议的时间亦可缩短。大约按情况，以十几个人，或二三十人，或四五十人，开会一星期左右为适宜。传达政策的会议，人数可以多些，时间亦不可过长。只有整党性质的高级及中级的干部会议，人数可以多些，时间亦可以长些。（丙）九月上半月，至迟九月下半月，全部直接从事土改工作的干部必须到达乡村，并开始工作，否则就不能利用秋冬两季全部时间，完成全部土改工作与整党建政工作，并准备春耕。
    （叁）
    在干部会议中及在工作中，必须教育干部善于分析具体情况，从不同地区，不同历史条件的具体情况出发，决定当地当时的工作任务和工作方法。必须区别城市和农村的不同，必须区别老区、半老区、接敌区和新区的不同，否则就要犯错误。
    （肆）
    凡属封建制度已经根本消灭，贫雇农已经得到大体上相当于平均数的土地，他们与中农所有土地虽有差别（这种差别是许可的）但是相差不多者，即应认为土地问题已经解决，不要再提土地改革问题。在这类地区的中心任务，是恢复和发展生产，完成整党建政工作及支援前线的工作。在这类地区的部分乡村中，如果尚有土地须待分配或调剂，阶级成份须待改订，土地证须待发给者，自然应当按照实际情形完成这些工作。
    （伍）
    在一切解放区，不论是已经完成土地改革的地区，或者尚未完成土地改革的地区，均必须在今年秋季指导农村人民耕种麦地，并进行一部分土地的秋耕。在冬季，要号召一切农村人民积肥。所有这些，都对一九四九年的农业生产和收成有极大重要性，必须用行政力量，配合群众工作，给以解决。
    （陆）
    必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态、或无政府状态。即擅自修改中央的或上级的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；在工作繁忙的借口之下，采取事前不请示事后不报告的错误态度，将自己管理的地方，看成好象一个独立国。这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大。各级党委必须对这一点进行反复讨论，认真克服这种无纪律状态或无政府状态，将一切可能和必须集中的权力，集中于中央和中央代表机关。
    （柒）
    中央、中央局（分局）、区党委（省委）、地委、县委、区委、直到支部，必须充分利用无线电、有线电、电话、邮递、专人送信等项通讯方法，小型会议（例如四五个人），区域会议（例如几个县），和个别谈话等项会谈方法，小型巡视团（例如三至五个人）和个别有威信的委员的巡视方法，同时充分利用通讯社及报纸，密切地互相联系起来，掌握运动的动态，随时互通情报，交流经验，及时纠正错误，发扬成绩。不要等候几个月，或半年，甚至更长时间，下面才向上面作总结性的报告，上面才向下面作一般性的指示。这种报告和指示，往往过时却失去作用，或者减少了作用。犯错误的已经犯过，来不及纠正，损失太大。全党迫切需要的，是不失时机的生动的具体的报告和指示。
    （捌）
    必须将城市工作和农村工作，将工业生产任务和农业生产任务，放到各中央局、分局、区党委、省委、地委及市委的领导工作的适当位置。即是说，不要因为领导土改工作和农业生产工作，而忽视或放松对于城市工作和工业生产工作的领导。我们现在已经有了许多大中小城市，和广大的工矿交通工作，如果各重要领导机关忽视或放松这一方面的工作，我们就要犯错误。
