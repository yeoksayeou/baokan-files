　　Inner Mongolia Construction Updates
    △ In order to develop industry, commerce, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and to establish sound financial institutions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has decided to organize the Inner Mongolia People's Bank and issue new currency. This new currency has been in circulation within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region since June 1st, and its value is exactly equal to that of the Northeast Bank circulating notes. Merchants and travelers trading in various places can exchange or remit money at the Inner Mongolia People's Bank in various places at any time, which is extremely convenient.
    △ In order to help the masses solve production difficulties, the Inner Mongolia Trade Bureau has vigorously allocated plowing cattle and seeds, and cast agricultural implements. A total of more than 26,000 jin of wheat seeds, more than 27,500 jin of rice seeds, and 35 shi of corn seeds have been allocated. 159 head of plowing cattle have been purchased on behalf of the farmers. The Taidong Iron Factory, directly under the Bureau, has cast 8,600 plowshares. Together with the 5,000 plowshares remaining from last year, a total of more than 13,000 plowshares have been allocated to farmers.
