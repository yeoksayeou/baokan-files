Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 21st: The Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh (Viet Minh) today commemorated the "1,000th Day of Viet Minh Resistance" (note: the Viet Minh's war of resistance against the French began on September 23, 1945, the day the French invading army reoccupied Saigon after Japan's surrender; June 20th of this year marks the "1,000th Day"). The Viet Minh broadcast on this day vehemently attacked French imperialism and the Vietnamese Nguyen Van Xuan puppet government it supports, and called on the Vietnamese army and people to intensify the destruction and attack of all French military installations. The Viet Minh broadcast also stated: General Nguyen Binh, Supreme Commander of the Viet Minh forces in South Vietnam, announced that he is determined to arrest Nguyen Van Xuan, "Chairman" of the Vietnamese puppet government, and "submit him to a military court for execution because he is guilty of treason and has been sentenced to death." (Note: The Vietnamese puppet government was established in Hanoi on June 6th of this year. France instigated Nguyen Van Xuan, a scoundrel of the Vietnamese nation, to serve as "Chairman" of the "Provisional Central Government of Vietnam." This "government" was conceived by former U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt and prepared by France for over a year, aiming to use the treacherous scheme of "using Vietnamese to control Vietnamese" to counter the Viet Minh's struggle for independence.) Agence France-Presse also reported that the railway tracks between Hanoi and Haiphong had been torn up, and bombing incidents against the French had occurred in Haiphong, adding that "these are part of the commonplace events in Tonkin province."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to a United Press report from Saigon citing a Viet Minh broadcast on the 15th: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently issued a statement opposing the agreement signed between former Annam King Bao Dai and the French government, which sells out Vietnamese independence. According to the agreement, both sides recognize Vietnam's so-called "independence" within the French Federation. The Viet Minh broadcast also stated that Ho Chi Minh said in his statement to the French Parliament that Bao Dai's signature on the agreement "cannot bind the Vietnamese people." The Viet Minh broadcast further stated that Vo Nguyen Giap, Minister of Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has ordered the Viet Minh army to intensify guerrilla warfare against the French invading army.

　　越盟抵抗千日纪念
  　号召军民加紧攻击法军
    胡志明总统斥保大签卖国协定
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据法新社河内二十一日电：越南独立同盟方面今日纪念“越盟抵抗千日纪念日”（按越盟抗法战争始于一九四五年九月二十三日，即法国侵略军在日本投降后重占西贡之日，至本年六月二十日恰为“千日”）。越盟广播是日猛烈抨击法帝国主义及其扶植下的越南阮文春傀儡政府，并号召越南军民加紧破坏与攻击法军之一切设备。越盟广播并说：南越越盟军最高指挥官阮平将军宣布，决将缉捕越南傀儡政府“主席”阮文春“提交军事法庭处刑，因他犯有叛国罪，已受死刑之判决。”（按越南傀儡政府于本年六月六日在河内成立，法国唆使越南民族败类阮文春出任“越南临时中央政府”的“主席”。该“政府”系由美国前驻法大使布立特向法国授意，经法国年余筹备而组成者，旨在利用“以越制越”奸计，以图对抗越盟争取独立的斗争。）法新社同时报导称：河内至海防间铁道线之铁轨已被拆毁，海防亦发生越人投弹抗法事件，并称，“这些是东京省司空见惯之事的一部分”。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据合众社西贡电引越盟十五日广播称：越南民主共和国总统胡志明顷发表声明，反对前安南王保大与法国政府间所签订的出卖越南独立的协定。根据该协定，双方承认越南在法兰西联邦内的所谓“独立”。越盟广播并称，胡志明在其致法国议会的声明中称：保大在协定上的签字，“不能约束越南人民”。越盟广播又称：越南民主共和国的国防部长武元甲，已下令越盟军队加紧进行反对法国侵略军的游击战争。
