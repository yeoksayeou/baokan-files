【Taihang News】The struggle to protect wheat in the border areas of northern Henan has now developed into a more intense stage. A reporter from the Taihang Branch, in a comprehensive review of the situation and experiences since the beginning of the wheat protection struggle in northern Henan, stated: For more than half a month, we have drawn on our experience in uniting against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, using military offensives combined with political offensives to effectively strike at the Chiang bandits, eliminating nearly a thousand enemies, and successfully covering the masses in completing the emergency harvest. This has turned the struggle situation in our border areas of northern Henan from passive to active, creating new favorable conditions for the second stage of the struggle. After suffering continuous blows, the enemy has gradually changed its tactics from small-scale incursions to focusing large forces on key areas for invasion. In response to the enemy's new conspiracy, our border areas convened meetings, rectified thinking, and re-equipped forces to carry out counter-maintenance struggles deep in the Chiang-occupied areas, combining armed offensives with political offensives to cover the masses in completing grain storage. Based on the experience of the previous stage of the struggle, we must grasp three basic links in order to gain the initiative in eliminating the enemy and protecting grain: First, we must firmly believe in the ability to eliminate the enemy in the inner lines, consolidate the will for long-term struggle, and constantly fight against the complacency and slackening that arise after certain victories. In the previous stage of the struggle, counties such as Anyang, Xiuwu, and Bo'ai universally carried out situation education to make everyone recognize the overall victory situation in the country, as well as the cruelty of the struggle against the enemy in some local areas due to the enemy's strength and our weakness. This boosted morale and overcame the idea of relying on and waiting for the main force, independently launching a mass-based guerrilla war, which turned the struggle to the offensive. This was most evident in Xiuwu. However, after some victories, new complacency began to grow in some areas, which urgently needs to be educated and overcome. After suffering some losses, individual villages mistakenly believed that "whoever works actively suffers the most," which is a manifestation of insufficient ideological preparation and requires continued morale boosting to establish the concept of long-term struggle. Second, in more than half a month of struggle, various localities began to pay attention to correcting policies, mobilizing and organizing the masses, and establishing and expanding the anti-Chiang united front. Bo'ai compensated the middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against with 370 mu of land, 178 rooms, and 50 head of livestock, and properly resettled the landlords. Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, and other places began to implement the policy of isolating the ringleaders and winning over their lower-level soldiers, enabling stubborn puppet soldiers to seize back some of their arms. At the same time, widespread publicity of various policies stabilized people's hearts, boosted the morale for the wheat protection struggle, and enabled the border area masses to voluntarily organize mutual aid for emergency harvesting and automatically expand militia armed forces. The self-defense resistance struggle of the masses in the Chiang-occupied areas has also greatly developed. More than a thousand escaped households returned to their villages in Xiuwu and other places. After we resettled them, they expressed their determination to fight the Chiang bandits to the end. However, some areas blindly attacked the masses who were incited and coerced by the Chiang bandits to rob wheat, which facilitated the enemy's creation of red-white antagonism; some areas' armed forces still have a purely military perspective, not connecting with the masses, and intelligence is not accurate, which weakened the strength of the struggle. This urgently needs to be overcome. Third, command posts at all levels were restored and strengthened from top to bottom in various localities. Jiaozuo organized three guerrilla groups, and Wuzhi organized 21 militia joint defense units, universally strengthening activities and combining production mutual aid groups with guerrilla war preparedness groups. A certain county and district, with hundreds of people's armed forces, went deep behind enemy lines, carried out activities day and night, and attacked the enemy's flanks and rear, which facilitated the frontal wheat protection struggle. A certain county's first and second districts organized 43 blasting groups, launched a "ten thousand thunder blasting" movement, laid minefields, and created new landmine warfare tactics, which played a significant role. However, the lower-level war organizations in some areas have not yet been strengthened, and some are not good at improving and transforming their own struggle methods according to the changes in the struggle situation and the characteristics of enemy activities. During the current period when the struggle between the enemy and us is becoming more intense, we must quickly transform.

### 团结对敌鼓舞斗志　豫北护麦转入主动

　　团结对敌鼓舞斗志
  　豫北护麦转入主动
    【太行讯】豫北边地护麦斗争现已发展到更紧张的阶段。太行分社记者顷综合评述豫北护麦斗争以来的形势和经验称：半月多来，我们发挥了抗日时期团结对敌斗争的经验，以军事出击结合政攻，有力的打击蒋匪，歼敌近千，掩护群众胜利完成抢收，使我豫北边地斗争形势由被动转入主动，给第二阶段的斗争创造了新的有利条件。敌在不断遭受打击后，逐渐改变了以小股出犯为主的战术，开始集中大股兵力实行重点侵犯。我边地各部针对敌人新的阴谋，分别召开会议，整顿思想，重新配备力量，以武装出击结合政治攻势，深入蒋占区，开展反维持斗争，掩护群众完成藏粮。根据前段斗争经验，在争取主动歼敌护粮上，今后必须掌握三个基本环节：首先必须坚定内线歼敌的信心，巩固长期斗争的意志，时刻与某些胜利后所产生的轻敌麻痹与松懈现象作斗争。前段斗争中，安阳、修武、博爱等县曾普遍进行形势教育，使大家认清全国的胜利形势，也认清局部地区因敌强我弱而形成的对敌斗争的残酷性，鼓舞斗志，克服了依靠与等待主力的思想，独立的开展了群众性游击战争，使斗争转向主动。这在修武看得最为显明。但是有些地区在获得一些胜利后，新的轻敌麻痹现象便又滋长，亟须教育克服。个别村庄遭受一些损失后，曾经误认为“谁积极干、谁倒霉大”，这是思想准备不足的表现，必须继续鼓舞斗志，树立长期斗争观念。其次，半月多的斗争中，各地开始注意端正政策，发动组织群众，建立与扩大反蒋统一战线。博爱以三百七十亩土地、一百七十八间房、五十头牲口补偿了错斗的中农，并适当安置了地主。修获武、焦作等地则开始执行了孤立匪首，争取其下层士兵的政策，使顽伪士兵夺回一部。同时，广泛宣传各种政策，安定了人心，鼓舞了保麦斗争的情绪，使边地群众自愿组织抢收互助，自动扩大民兵武装。蒋占区群众的自卫抗征斗争也得到很大发展。修武等地千余逃亡户返乡，我加以安置后，他们表示要与蒋匪斗争到底。但有些地区对有蒋匪煽动胁迫抢麦的群众一律盲目打击，便利了敌人制造赤白对立；有些地区武装仍有单纯军事观点，不与群众联系，情报不灵，以致减弱了斗争的力量。亟应注意克服。第三、各地由上而下的恢复与健全了各级指挥部，焦作组织了三个游击集团，武陟组织了二十一个民兵联防，普遍加强活动，并使生产互助小组与游击备战小组结合起来。某县某区以数百人的武装深入敌后，日夜活动，打击敌之侧后，便利了正面保麦斗争。某县一、二区组织了四十三个爆炸组，展开万雷爆炸运动，布设地雷区，创造了新的地雷战法，发挥作用很大。但有些地区的下层战争机构仍未健全起来，有的还不善于根据斗争形势的变化，针对敌人活动的特点来改进和转变自己的斗争方式，在目前敌我斗争更趋紧张时期，必须迅速转变。
