　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: United Press International, Brussels: The Belgian Communist Party, on the day following the start of the strike by 250,000 steelworkers in Belgium (June 17th), issued a circular calling on workers across the country to join the steelworkers' strike. Workers at large chemical plants in Liège, Belgium's foremost industrial city, announced on the 18th that they would strike within a specified time to support the steelworkers. A government spokesperson admitted on the 17th that the strike was "slowly but surely paralyzing the country's industrial potential." At the same time, the government fears that the strike, called for by the Belgian Communist Party, will cause "economic disruption," thereby delaying the "Benelux Economic Union scheduled to be organized early next year."
 
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: London dispatch: The strike by port dockworkers here continues to expand. On the 18th, "the last group of dockworkers in Greater London also joined the strike" (United Press International). The number of strikers has increased from 12,000 on the 16th to 15,200 on the 19th. The number of ships停驶 has also increased to over 120 on the 19th. "Greater London is now completely paralyzed" (United Press International). Amidst public anger, the British government attempted to make slight concessions, allowing for a reduction in the penalties for the eleven dockworkers who refused to unload zinc oxide in pursuit of special bonuses, in order to stop the strike. Deakin, the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, also personally came forward to ask the strikers to return to work. In response, the chairman of the strike committee declared on the 19th that a return to work would only be possible if the unjust judgment against the eleven dockworkers was overturned. After the strike, the scabs of the Transport and General Workers' Union (to which the dockworkers belong), at a mass meeting convened on the 18th, threatened the strikers, "advising" them to return to work, but "angry strikers shouted them off the stage" (United Press International).

　　比共号召全国总罢工
  　英码头工人罢工继续扩大
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】合众社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时共产党在比国廿五万钢铁工人开始罢工之次日（十七日）发出通告，号召全国工人参加钢铁工人的罢工。比国第一工业城市列日之大化学工厂工人，已于十八日宣布将在指定时间以内罢工，以支援钢铁工人。政府发言人于十七日承认：罢工已在“慢慢地但却确定地瘫痪着全国工业的潜力。”同时，政府方面并深恐在比共号召下的罢工将造成“经济紊乱”，从而拖延“定于明年初组织的荷比卢经济联盟”。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】伦敦消息：此间港口码头工人的罢工继续扩大。十八日，“大伦敦港的最后一批码头工人亦参加罢工”（合众社）。罢工人数已由十六日的一万二千人增至十九日的一万五千二百人。停驶的船只亦于十九日增至一百二十余艘。“大伦敦港现已完全陷于麻痹状态”（合众社）。在群情愤怒之下，英政府曾企图稍作让步，允许减轻对十一名因争取特别奖金而拒绝起卸氧化锌的码头工人的处罚，以停止罢工。运输及各业工人工会的总书记狄金，亦曾亲自出而要求罢工者复工。对此，罢工委员会主席于十九日宣称，只有取消对十一名码头工人之不公正的裁判，复工才有可能。罢工以后，运输及各业工人工会（码头工人即属于此一工会）的工贼们，在十八日召集的群众会上，曾对罢工者施以威胁，“劝告”他们复工，但“愤怒的罢工者们将他们吼下台来”（合众社）。
