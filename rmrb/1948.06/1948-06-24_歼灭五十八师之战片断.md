Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st. On the evening of June 1st, a unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army surrounded the headquarters of the Kuomintang's 58th Division and its main force, the 183rd Brigade, along with a part of the 10th Division, in the villages around Maliuying on the east bank of the Baihe River, east of Nanyang. On the night of the 2nd, American-made bombers continuously dropped flares and heavy bombs on our army's positions, and the besieged enemy also continuously shelled. At the same time, our army's preparations for the general attack were also fully completed. The soldiers excitedly discussed: "The time has come to perform meritorious service for the people," "Don't forget the combat plan you have made." This is a new atmosphere after a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army launched the Three Great Democratic Movements. The brave are now even braver; those who were timid in the past will also strive to be heroes in this battle. Cui Qingcai, a new recruit in the machine gun squad, once again requested to join the rifle squad to charge. The instructor smiled and refused because too many people requested to charge. The general attack began at two o'clock at dawn. Under the powerful artillery cover of our army, the soldiers of the Eighth Company cleverly approached the forward positions of Maliuying. Wang Yuku, the leader of the Fifth Squad, led the entire squad at the forefront, passing the enemy's barricades with lightning speed and entering the enemy's bunker complex. Liu Zijiang, the leader of the Fourth Squad, was shot in the right arm. Everyone advised him to go down, but he shook his arms anxiously and said, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter," and rushed towards a house at the entrance of the village. Then his left arm was also wounded, but he still did not leave the front line, and shouted loudly to the soldiers: "Comrades, we must resolutely fight the enemy and complete our plan to perform meritorious service." Ma Angui, a liberated soldier from the Fifth Squad, took the lead in climbing over the wall, and a large number of soldiers followed him into the village. Friendly neighboring troops also attacked at this time, and the enemies were so suppressed that they did not dare to move. So the soldiers shouted excitedly: "Kuomintang brothers, surrender and you will not be killed! Don't sell your lives for Chiang Kai-shek anymore!" With the shouts, groups of Kuomintang soldiers came out of the houses and surrendered their guns. An hour later, the battle was completely over, and the People's Liberation Army escorted a large number of prisoners out of Maliuying, including Wei Peicang, the commander of the 183rd Brigade. After dawn, groups of people from Maliuying went home. The soldiers said: "Folks, you have been frightened. The enemy has been wiped out, go home and harvest the wheat!" The people replied with smiles: "You have worked hard. After this year's wheat is harvested, it will no longer be snatched away by those bastards."

　　歼灭五十八师之战片断
    【新华社中原前线廿一日电】六月一日晚间，中原解放军某部把蒋军五十八师师部和它的主力一八三旅，连同十师一部，包围在南阳以东白河东岸马刘营一带村庄内。二号夜里，美制轰炸机不断的向我军阵地投下照明弹和重磅炸弹，被围的敌人也不住地发炮。我军总攻击的准备工作同时也已全部完成。战士们兴奋的谈论着：“给人民立功的时候到了”，“可不要忘了自己订的战斗计划。”这是解放军某部开展三大民主运动以后的新气象。过去勇敢的现在更加勇敢了；过去胆怯的，也要在这次战斗中争取当英雄。机枪班新战士崔庆材，再一次要求加入步枪班去冲锋，指导员微笑着拒绝了，因为要求冲锋的人太多了。拂晓两点总攻开始。在我军强大的炮火掩护下，八连的战士们机敏的接近了马刘营的前沿工事。五班长王玉库带领全班冲在最前面，以神速的动作越过敌人的鹿砦，进入敌人的碉堡群中。四班长刘子江右膀中了一颗子弹，大家劝他下去，他着急的把两臂一摇说：“不碍事，不碍事”，便向着村口的一座房子冲去。接着他的左膀又带了彩，但他仍然不下火线，并大声的向战士们喊道：“同志们要坚决地打敌人，完成咱们的立功计划。”五班解放战士马安贵带头翻过墙头，大批战士跟着冲进村内，友邻部队也于这时攻进来，敌人都被压迫得不敢动弹了。于是战士们兴奋地喊着：“蒋军兄弟们，缴枪不杀！不要再替蒋介石卖命！”随着喊话声，一伙伙的蒋军从屋子里走出来缴枪。一小时以后，战斗全部结束，解放军押送着大批俘虏走出马刘营，其中有一八三旅旅长魏沛苍等。天明后，马刘营的老百姓一群一群的走回家去。战士们说：“老乡们受惊啦。敌人消灭了，快回家收麦吧！”老百姓笑容满面的回答说：“你们辛苦了。今年的麦子收了后，再也不会给龟孙们抢去了。”
