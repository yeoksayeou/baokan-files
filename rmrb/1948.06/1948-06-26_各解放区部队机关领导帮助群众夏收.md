Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: During the summer harvest, military organs in various liberated areas are actively leading and helping the masses harvest wheat. The Huanglong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia has dispatched more than 200 cadres to the countryside to help the masses organize the rush harvest. Qiang Zixiu, Secretary of the CPC Prefectural Committee, and Wang Enhui, Deputy Commissioner, have also personally gone to various counties to arrange and lead the summer harvest work. A certain unit of the Jianghan Military Region in Central Plains is helping the people harvest wheat and plant rice seedlings, stipulating that regardless of cadres or soldiers, each person should provide five workdays of assistance (each workday is ten hours). In the first phase, they did the work for 200 dan (unit of dry measure) of fields, equivalent to more than 600 workdays. The assistance team strictly implements the three major disciplines: 1. Do not eat or drink the masses' wine and food; 2. Do not smoke the masses' tea and cigarettes; 3. Respect the masses' customs and habits. The people gratefully said: "The People's Liberation Army is good in every way, but it is not good to not eat when helping with farming." An old woman also said to the comrades planting rice seedlings: "In the future, Chairman Mao should add another rule for you: you must eat the peasants' rice planting meals." In the East China Military Region, the movement of organs and troops helping the people with wheat harvesting has become a surge. The Military Region Headquarters harvested 120 mu (unit of area) in one day. Various units directly under the Shandong Corps have pulled up more than 1,350 mu of wheat (due to the large number of people and the shortage of sickles, they used their hands). A certain unit's stretcher transport team completed the work of pulling, bundling, and transporting 155 mu of wheat fields in one and a half days. The enthusiasm of various units to help with the harvest is very high. Many personnel returning from afar in the Military Region Headquarters participated in wheat cutting the next day. Many female comrades also participated in various labor such as cutting, bundling, and carrying.

　　各解放区部队机关领导帮助群众夏收
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】夏收期间，各解放区部队机关，正积极领导与帮助群众收麦。陕甘宁黄龙分区已抽派二百余干部下乡帮助群众组织抢收，中共地委书记强自修、副专员王恩惠等亦亲赴各县布置领导夏收工作。中原江汉军区某部助民割麦栽秧，规定不论干部或战士，每个人助工五个（每个工十小时），第一期又做了二百担田的活，约合六百多个工。助工队严格执行三大纪律：一、不吃群众酒饭，二、不吃群众茶烟，三、尊重群众风俗习惯。老百姓感激地说：“解放军什么都好，就是帮助种田不吃饭不好。”有个老太婆也对栽秧的同志说：“以后要毛主席给你们多订一条：要吃老百姓的栽秧饭。”华东军区机关部队助民收麦已成热潮，军区司令部一天中即收割一百廿亩。山东兵团直属队各单位已拔麦（因人多镰刀少故用手拔）一千三百五十余亩。某部担架运输团一天半时间，完成一百五十五亩麦田的拔、捆、搬运工作。各部助收情绪甚高，军区司令部很多由远地回来的人员，第二天便参加割麦。许多女同志也参加割、捆、挑各种劳动。
