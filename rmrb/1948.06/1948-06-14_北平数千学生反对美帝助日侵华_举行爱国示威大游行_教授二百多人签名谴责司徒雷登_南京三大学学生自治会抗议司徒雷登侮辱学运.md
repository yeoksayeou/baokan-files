Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. A compilation of foreign news agency reports: Thousands of students in Beiping (Agence France-Presse reported 4,000, other news agencies did not report the exact number) bravely broke through the heavy obstacles of the Kuomintang traitorous government on the 9th and held a patriotic demonstration and parade to protest the United States' support of Japanese aggression threatening China, and the statement of US Ambassador Stuart interfering in China's internal affairs. The demonstrating students continued to bravely advance despite being threatened by the military and police firing their guns twice, with five students suffering head injuries. Twelve schools in the city have been involved in this great patriotic movement. Yenching University, Peking University, and some other schools began their strike on the 8th. The reactionary pro-Japanese policy of US imperialism and Stuart's shameless statement aroused the indignation of patriotic and democratic people in Peiping and Tianjin. 211 professors and people from the cultural circles of various universities in Beiping have signed a statement, issuing a stern condemnation. Two professors from Peiyang University in Tianjin refused to accept the materials donated by the American relief group because "Stuart and American Consul General in Shanghai Cabot insulted the Chinese people" (Associated Press).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. According to various sources: Students from twelve universities and specialized schools in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan have recently formed the "United Association of Students Against US Aid to Japan". In its declaration, the association listed the evidence of US imperialism aiding the revival of Japanese imperialism and called on the Chinese people to rise up to prevent the recurrence of Japanese aggression. Another report: Teachers and students of Tsinghua University in Beiping held a symposium on the Japanese issue in late May and held a rotating exhibition of materials on the Japanese issue in various universities. The students of the school denounced the "US Aid to Japan Plan" which helped the revival of Japanese fascism, and opposed the Chiang government's continued export of iron sand to Japan, strengthening Japan's aggressive forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Following the joint denunciation by students from ten universities in Peiping and Tianjin against Stuart's distortion of facts and extremely insulting statement against the Chinese student patriotic movement, the student unions of three universities in Nanjing: Central University, Jinling University, and Jinling Women's University, have drafted a protest letter "condemning the United States for aiding Chiang Kai-shek for its own selfish interests" (Associated Press). According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th, the protest letter contains five main points: (1) The Chinese students' protest against the US policy toward Japan is purely a manifestation of the patriotic and nationalistic enthusiasm shared by every Chinese person. (2) The policy toward Japan implemented by MacArthur violated the Potsdam Declaration, especially in allowing Japan to raise its industrial level to restore its aggressive forces. (3) Stuart warned the students to be "responsible for the consequences of their actions," but the real responsibility should be borne by the United States, because the United States supported Japan with actions, while the students only expressed protests with words. (4) US aid to China (Chiang) is advancing its plan to compete for world hegemony, which only further fuels the Chinese civil war. (5) Stuart's statement attempts to require students in schools run by American churches to blindly support American policies, without allowing them to question their impact on China. The student unions of the three schools stated that this protest letter will be submitted to Stuart after it has been signed by the students of the three schools.

　　北平数千学生反对美帝助日侵华
  　举行爱国示威大游行
    教授二百多人签名谴责司徒雷登
    南京三大学学生自治会抗议司徒雷登侮辱学运
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合外国通讯社消息：北平数千学生（法新社说有四千，其他通讯社未报导确数），于九日英勇突破国民党卖国政府重重阻扰，举行爱国示威大游行，抗议美国扶植日本侵略势力威胁中国，及美国大使司徒雷登干涉中国内政的声明。示威学生不顾军警两度开枪恫吓，学生五人头部被击伤，仍继续英勇前进。本市已有十二个学校卷入此一伟大爱国运动。燕京、北大及若干学校已于八日开始罢课。美帝国主义的反动扶日政策及司徒雷登无耻声明，激起平津爱国民主人士的愤慨。北平各大学教授及文化界二百十一人已签署声明，加以严正谴责。天津北洋大学两教授拒绝接受美国救济团所赠与的物资，因为“司徒雷登和美国驻沪总领事卡波特侮辱了中国人民”（合众社）。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方消息：平津唐山十二所大学及专科学校学生，已于最近组成“反对美国援日学生联合会”，该会在宣言中列举美帝国主义援助日本帝国主义复活的证据，并呼吁中国人民起来阻止日本侵略的重演。又讯：北平清华大学师生，曾于五月下旬举行日本问题座谈会，并在各大学轮回展览日本问题资料。该校学生痛斥帮助日本法西斯主义复活的“美国援日计划”，并反对蒋政府继续以铁砂输日，壮大日本侵略势力。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】继平津十大学学生联合痛斥司徒雷登歪曲事实，极端侮辱中国学生爱国运动声明后，南京三个大学中大、金陵、金陵女大学生自治会，已草成抗议书，“谴责美国为一已私利援助蒋介石”（美联社）。据美联社南京九日电透露：该抗议书内容共五个要点，为：（一）中国学生抗议美国对日政策，纯系每一个中国人民所共有的爱国家爱民族热情的表现。（二）麦克阿瑟所执行的对日政策，破坏了波茨顿宣言，特别在容许日本提高工业水平，以恢复其侵略势力方面。（三）司徒警告学生要对他们“行动的后果负责”，但真正的责任却应由美国担负，因为美国以行动扶植日本，而学生不过以言论表示抗议。（四）美国援华（蒋）的举措，在推进其争夺世界霸权的计划，此仅更加助长中国内战。（五）司徒的声明，企图要求美国教会主办的学校学生必须盲目支持美国的政策，而不容许过问其对中国的影响如何。该三校学生自治会称：此一抗议书一俟三校同学签名完毕后，即将递交司徒雷登。
