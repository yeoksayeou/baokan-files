Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th: Lunan is launching social mutual aid for disaster relief and famine alleviation. Under the slogan "A mouthful of help when it's not needed is better than a peck when it is," the spirit of class friendship that "all farmers under heaven are one family" is being promoted. Wangjia Village, Lijia Village and other ten villages in the third district of Pingyi (newly established county, south of Fei County) have raised and donated more than 2,000 jin of grain and 1,100 jin of cotton seeds to relieve the severely affected Maojialing and other seven villages. The district chief of the district donated 15 jin of grain from his own family, influencing the whole village to enthusiastically donate more than 500 jin. Representatives from the assisted villages were warmly received and comforted by the donating villages when they went to collect grain and express their thanks. The representatives relayed back to their village, "We wanted to say some nice things, but they said even nicer things than we could." A certain district in Fei County launched a "handful of grain" campaign and donated more than 5,400 jin of grain in five days. The district's Production and Disaster Relief Committee used 3,000 jin of it to relieve the Liangqiu district, which was severely affected. The remainder was left to Gao Feicheng District and Gaoqiao District for relief efforts. The method of educating the masses with examples of disaster situations and inspiring the masses' sympathy for disaster victims was the most effective in fundraising. For example, after a village introduced the case of a woman in Quanzihu Village, Bu Xia District, who dropped her own daughter due to the famine, 48 households immediately signed up to donate grain. Shidou Village, the third district of Cangshan (newly established county), was the most severely affected. Under the influence of relief from other districts, the village also launched mutual aid. The village instructor, Yang Zhen, was the first to donate half of his own saved grain, 30 jin of millet. When Cangshan sent relief grain, the village replied in a letter that they were determined to respond to their assistance with hard work in production, and planned to send a portion of this year's harvest to express their gratitude.

　　鲁南展开社会互济
  　救灾渡荒获大成效
    【新华社华东二十九日电】鲁南各地正展开社会互济救灾渡荒，在“无时帮一口，强似有时帮一斗”的口号下，发扬了“天下农民是一家”的阶级友爱。平邑（新设县，在费县南）三区王家村、李家村等十个村，已募集捐了二千余斤粮食，一千一百斤棉种救济灾重的毛家岭等七个村。该区区长回本村首先捐出十五斤粮食，影响全村踊跃捐出五百多斤。被救济村选派代表至捐助村取粮并致谢时，受到捐助村的热情招待与安慰。代表们回村后传达说：“咱去想说些好话，可是人家说的比咱还好。”费县某口区开展了一把粮运动，五天中即捐出粮食五千四百余斤。该区生产救灾委员会以其中三千斤救济了灾情较重的梁邱区。高费城区、高桥区，其余留作木区救济。募捐中以灾情实例教育群众，激发群众对灾民同情心的方法收效最大。如某村介绍埠下区泉子窳村一妇女，因灾荒摔掉自己女孩的实例后，当场报名捐粮者有四十八户。苍山（新设县）三区石斗村灾情最重，在外区救济影响下，本村亦发起了互济，村指导员杨贞首先即捐出自己存粮的一半三十斤谷子。苍山送来救济粮时，该村回信表示决以努力生产来回答他们的救助，并拟在今年收获中送去一部，以表谢意。
