[Ping-Sui Front, 16th dispatch] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines convened a conference of cadres at the platoon level and above on the 2nd and 3rd to summarize the battle experience of the Tumu Railway Station on the Ping-Sui Line using a sand table. At the beginning of the summary, the commanders of the participating units entered the large sand table and used various models to gradually set up the situation according to the actual battle situation and make various movements while setting up and explaining. During the setup and explanation, all comrades present could raise questions, doubts, and supplements. Whether the command, fire organization and command, movement routes, and selection of assault points of each unit at that time were good or bad could be seen very clearly and understandably. During the Battle of Tumu Railway Station, Wang Kuiyuan, the deputy company commander of a certain unit, acted arbitrarily and disrupted the entire deployment. After the battle, he completely pushed the responsibility onto a certain company commander. After several investigations by superiors, it was not easy to clarify. During the sand table operation, all participating comrades were present. A certain squad proved that it was Wang Kuiyuan who ordered the squad to advance and assault. As soon as the attack began, he took a platoon and avoided the frontal attack route, turning to the side, which clarified the responsibility and educated everyone. Sand table setup can help cadres learn tactics and make progress. For example, regarding the selection of the forward route at that time, Guo Yushan, the deputy company commander of the first company, said with pride and impetuosity: "Watch me set it up!" As a result, he set it up wrong, and the mistakes were clear, so he had to say, "I am careless and didn't use my brain." During the entire review, many comrades became more humble, and their interest in studying actual combat experience increased. For three days, several platoon leaders studied for a whole day. All comrades felt that sand table operation is the best method for summarizing battles, practicing battles, and training troops. Sand table review is much more effective than meeting review. The leadership said: "Sand table operation can make the understanding of the situation more real, clear, profound, and comprehensive. It can also inspire the enthusiasm of the masses and encourage everyone to use their brains. Therefore, this is a good method of the mass line for implementing military democracy."

　　前线某部试行军事民主
  　用沙盘总结土木车站战斗
    情况一目了然总结时又明白又便当
    【平绥前线十六日电】前线解放军某部，于二、三两日召集排以上干部大会，用沙盘总结平绥线土木车站战斗经验。总结开始，由参战各部队首长进入大沙盘，用各种模型，依实战情况，逐渐摆设，并作各种运动，一面摆设，一面解释。摆设解释中，全场同志都可提出问题、质疑、补充。对当时各部队掌握指挥，火力组织指挥，运动道路及突击点的选择，是好是坏都看得十分确实、明白。土木车站战斗中，某部副连长王奎元任意行动，破坏了整个布署，战后他把责任完全推到某连长身上。上级几次调查，不易搞清，沙盘作业中，参战各同志都到，某班证明下令该班突击前进者是王奎元。进攻一开始他就带一个排避开正面进攻道路折到一边去了，这就把责任弄明白了，教育了大家。沙盘摆设可帮助干部战术学习进步，比如当时选择的前进道路，一连副连长郭玉山骄傲一冲主义的说：“看我摆”！结果摆错了，错处清清楚楚，于是他自己不得不说“我粗枝大叶，没用脑筋”。整个检讨中，很多同志都变得虚心了，研究实战经验的兴趣增加了，三日有几个排长研究整整一天。全体同志都感到沙盘作业是总结战斗、练习战斗、训练部队最好的方法。沙盘检讨比开会检讨有效的多。领导上就说：“沙盘作业可使情况了解的更真实、明白、深远、全面。又可启发群众的积极性、启发大家动脑筋，因此这是实行军事民主的群众路线好方法”。
