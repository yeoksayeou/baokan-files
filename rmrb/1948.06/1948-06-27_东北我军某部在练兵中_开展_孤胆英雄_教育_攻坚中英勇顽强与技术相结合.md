　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th—A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines is enthusiastically carrying out "Lone Hero" education during the great training movement, combining the heroic tenacity of all commanders and fighters with tactics and techniques in offensive operations in order to reduce casualties and expand victories. At the start of the training movement, the unit put forward the slogan "Master skills, create a large number of lone heroes," and made general publicity about why lone heroes should be created and the advantages of lone combat, so that everyone could begin deliberations. Initially, many soldiers had ideological concerns. Some lacked confidence in lone combat, thinking that "the enemy is numerous, and we are few, so it won't work," fearing they wouldn't be able to retreat after going up. Others believed that once the enemy was dealt with, if follow-up troops didn't keep up, the many prisoners would "flip" (meaning rebel). Still others thought that some past lone heroes were "lucky" and that "it wouldn't work if you weren't lucky." After understanding these ideological circumstances, the leadership took various measures to persuade them one by one. For example, during repeated drills of delivering explosives and seizing bunkers, the classes took turns acting as simulated enemies and observing inside the bunkers, which made everyone realize that it was better to have fewer people to attack a bunker because a small target is not easily detected, thus initially clearing up their thinking. Next, they invited the "lone heroes" of each regiment—Bai Zhigui, Zhang Wencai, Ma Fuying, and Wang Xiru—to report their combat experiences to each unit. Then, questions were raised based on the reports for discussion, so that the soldiers ideologically clarified that lone heroes are a true combination of bravery and skill, eliminating the concept of "luck." At the same time, they recognized that because our army's offensive has superior firepower and strength, lone penetrations are not afraid of being cut off by the enemy; if the enemy is dealt with, the follow-up troops will closely follow, and as long as the prisoner policy is strictly implemented, prisoners are educated, and vigilance is not relaxed, even if there are many prisoners, they will not "flip." At this time, some companies also invited liberated soldiers to introduce their past difficulties and experiences in defending bunkers in the Kuomintang army, as well as the specific circumstances of our army's attack on the bunkers at that time, which greatly educated the soldiers. The unit also used lone hero Bai Zhigui as a typical example, continuously reporting his combat experience and ideological activities in the unit newspaper, widely publicizing it, staging the "Hero Bai Zhigui" opera in each regiment in rotation, and each company conducted education in connection with Bai Zhigui's lone actions. After breaking down everyone's concerns one by one, the leadership then systematically carried out the propaganda of "Glory to the Lone Hero" in each unit, so that everyone regarded becoming a "Lone Hero" as supreme glory. When studying the conditions for becoming a "Lone Hero," the soldiers proposed that in addition to the necessary conditions such as bravery, agility, fearlessness of difficulty, and mastering skills, it is also necessary to strengthen the determination to avenge the oppressed people in order to be an outstanding lone hero. After this upsurge was set off, the leadership also paid attention to preventing another ideological deviation of regarding lone heroes as individualistic actions, opposing the bravery of a reckless man who does not contact or cooperate with others. After gradually deepening education, the unit has had extensive development in the movement to create "lone heroes." Now, the vast majority of soldiers have a high degree of confidence in single-person blasting, single-person or small-group seizing of bunkers, etc. More than 60 percent of the soldiers in the Fourth Company of a certain regiment proposed to learn from Bai Zhigui and strive to become "lone heroes."

　　东北我军某部在练兵中
  　开展“孤胆英雄”教育
    攻坚中英勇顽强与技术相结合
    【新华社东北二十五日电】解放军前线某部在大练兵运动中热烈展开“孤胆英雄”教育，使攻击作战中全军指战员的英勇顽强与战术技术相结合，以便减少伤亡，扩大胜利。练兵运动开始时，该部即提出“学好本领，创造大批孤胆英雄”的口号，把为什么要创造孤胆英雄与孤胆作战的优点作一般的宣传动员，使大家展开酝酿。起初好多战士思想上都存在着顾虑，有的对孤胆作战缺乏信心，认为“敌人多，我们人少了就不行”，怕上去后下不来，有的认为一旦解决了敌人，如果后续部队跟不上来，俘虏多就会“翻把”（即反叛哗变之意）。有的则认为过去有些孤胆英雄是“碰巧”碰上的，“碰不上就不行”。领导上了解这些思想情况后，遂采取各种办法逐一加以说服。如在反复演习送炸药，夺地堡等动作时，即由各班轮流作假设敌情，到地堡里去观察，结果使大家体会到打地堡还是人少些好，因目标小不易被发觉，于是初步打通了思想。接着请各团“孤胆英雄”白志贵、张文才、马富英、王西如等到各单位报告他们的作战经验。然后根据报告提出问题进行讨论，使战士们从思想上明确孤胆英雄是真正勇敢和技术的结合，消除了“碰巧”的观念。同时认识到由于我军的进攻有着优势的火力与兵力，孤胆深入不怕被敌切断；要是解决了敌人，后续部队就会紧跟上来，只要严格执行俘虏政策，对俘虏进行教育，又不松懈警惕性，又使俘虏多也不会“翻把”。有的连队此时还请了解放战士介绍他们过去在蒋军里守地堡的困难和经验，以及我军攻打地堡当时的具体情况，对战士的教育都很大。该部并以孤胆英雄白志贵为典型，把他的作战经验，思想活动等在部队报纸上连续报导，广泛宣传，到各团轮流演出“英雄白志贵”歌剧，各连队都联系白志贵孤胆行为进行教育。这样逐一打破大家的顾虑后，领导上又有计划的在各单位中进行“孤胆英雄光荣”的宣传，使大家以当“孤胆英雄”为无尚的光荣。战士们在研究当“孤胆英雄”的条件时提出：除了勇敢、机敏、不怕困难、练好本领等必具的条件外，还必须加强为被压迫人民复仇的决心，才是卓越的孤胆英雄。该部在这种热潮掀起后，领导上又注意防止另一种把孤胆英雄当作是个人独往独行的思想偏差，反对不与别人联系，不与别人配合的匹夫之勇。经过逐步深入的教育后，该部在创造“孤胆英雄”运动上已有了广泛的开展。现在绝大部分的战士对单人爆破，单人或小组夺地堡等等都有了高度的胜利信心。某团四连有百分之六十以上的战士提出向白志贵学习，争作“孤胆英雄”。
