  　Comments on Anglo-American Struggle for the Ruhr
  　Fierce Contests Behind the Joint Anti-Soviet Facade
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] TASS Berlin: Famous German economist Norden, in an article in the "German Opinion" newspaper on the 9th, commented on the Anglo-American struggle for Ruhr steel, saying: Behind the London and Washington joint anti-Soviet facade, fierce battles are taking place; this is most evident in the Palestine issue. The struggle in West Germany, although conducted behind the scenes, is no less intense than the former. At a recent meeting in Frankfurt, US occupation commander Clay opposed the report by British occupation commander Robertson on decentralizing West German steel concerns. Clay openly advocated further recentralization of these decisive industries, and organizing them in the manner of the Ruhr coal industry. As is well known, the Ruhr coal industry has not only not abolished the old cartel organizations, but has also established a central administration headed by American coal magnates, with the original German industrialists managing its activities. Therefore, the conflict between Clay and Robertson shows that the United States is emerging to seize the remaining British positions. Two months ago, Clay ordered Brownson, the anti-cartel minister in the US zone, to cease all work on abolishing German cartels. Norden said: Clay's policy has caused cheers in the mansions of German monopoly capitalists, because they intend to ally with Wall Street to resume their role as the head of the German economy and politics.

　　德国经济学家诺登
  　评英美争鲁尔
  　在联合反苏招牌背后进行激烈角斗
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社柏林讯：著名德国经济学家诺登，九日在“德国舆论”报上著文评英美对鲁尔钢铁的争夺称：在伦敦与华盛顿联合反苏招牌的背后，正发生着激烈的战斗；这在巴勒斯坦问题上已极明显。在西德的斗争，虽在幕后进行，但其激烈的程度，并不亚于前者。最近在法兰克福的一次会议上美占领军司令克莱，反对英占领军司令罗伯逊关于分散西德钢铁康采仑的报告。克莱公然主张进一步将这些有决定意义的工业重新集中；并依照鲁尔煤业的式样组织起来。如众所周知，鲁尔煤业不仅未废除旧的卡特尔组织，并且以美国煤业巨头为首，成立了中央管理局；由原来的德国工业家，管理其活动。因此，克莱与罗伯逊的冲突，显示了美国正出而攫取剩下的英国阵地。在两个月以前克莱就曾命令美占区废除卡特尔部部长布朗生停止一切废除德国卡特尔的工作。诺登称：克莱的政策，在德国垄断资本家的公馆中，引起了欢呼；因为他们打算与华尔街结盟，重新充任德国经济与政治的首脑。
