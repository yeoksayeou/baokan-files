Xinhua News Agency, North China, 24th: According to reports from the Yishibao, Dagongbao and other newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin, the situation of the Beiping students' June 9th patriotic anti-aggression movement is as follows:

Following the joint demonstration of thousands of students from Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan at Peking University on May 30th against the US policy of supporting Japan, more than 4,000 students in Beiping held a heroic patriotic demonstration on June 9th.

On the 9th, nine major universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Teachers College, Chaoyang University, Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, North China College, and Railway College, announced a general strike. Upon hearing this news, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government immediately dispatched a large number of troops, police, military police, and secret agents to set up cordons on all major streets. The US consulate, under the tight protection of Chiang's troops, kept its doors tightly closed. Even the entrances and exits of "Dongjiaominxiang," where it was located, were under police lockdown. The entire ancient city was shrouded in a terrifying atmosphere of bayonets.

However, all the suppression and threats of the Chiang government could not stop the great patriotic movement of the passionate youth. In the early morning, the marching队伍 set off from three locations: the first group of students from Yenching and Tsinghua University entered the city from the western suburbs and were once blocked outside Xizhimen. The second group of more than 1,000 students from Sino-French University, Peking University, and other schools gathered at Peking University, broke through several lines of military and police guards, and advanced heroically. Many citizens and shop clerks along the way automatically joined the patriotic march. Thousands of young arms were covered with slogans and cartoons against the US supporting Japan and threatening China, written on passing cars, trams, pedicabs, and the walls of shops on both sides. The shouts of "Oppose US Support for Japan!" reverberated through the streets like thunder. During the march, the队伍 encountered a large number of police and military police blockades. In front of the shining bayonets, the students staged a street play depicting the re-aggression of China by Japanese fascists under US support. The play depicted a Japanese soldier massacring Chinese compatriots and insulting women. The ancient city once again heard the tragic cries of those persecuted by the Japanese invaders. At this time, many onlookers were filled with grief and indignation, and even the police surrounding the students could not help but secretly wipe their eyes. The people of Beiping have not forgotten the eight years of bloody vengeance inflicted by the Japanese fascists, and they cannot stand by and watch our national enemy, under the criminal policy of US-Chiang collusion and support, grow stronger again and threaten China.

After the street play, the second group of marchers was heavily surrounded by fully armed police, military police, and "protection corps" at Dong'anmen. Under the personal command of fascist heads such as Ni Chaofan, director of the Chiang bandit garrison headquarters inspection office, Tang Yongwei, director of the police bureau, and Mei Qinglan, commander of the 19th military police regiment, the police and military police opened fire to prevent the students from advancing. However, the demonstration行列 remained orderly amidst the gunfire, highly demonstrating the heroic spirit of Chinese youth in the patriotic struggle.

The third group of marchers, composed of students from Beiping Normal College, Peking University Fourth Courtyard (dormitories for freshmen), and other institutions, greeted the Yenching and Tsinghua University students, the first group of marching brothers who were blocked outside the city, to enter the city. The two行列 merged into a torrent of steel, marching mightily towards the east city to aid the surrounded students. Patriotic songs and slogans shook the entire city, and various patriotic cartoons and slogans were posted everywhere.

The second group of marchers confronted the military police at Dong'anmen for four hours. It was not until 1:50 pm, after learning that the first and third行列 had joined and were approaching, that these unarmed students, braving the stone, wooden stick, and leather belt beatings of the military police and a second warning shot, broke through the military police blockade. Two male and two female students were seriously injured in the head, and more than a dozen were slightly injured. Pools of patriots' blood flowed on the road. They finally joined the other two行列 at Donghuamen in victory.

After the two patriotic行列, as close as flesh and blood, united, everyone shouted patriotic slogans such as "Down with US Imperialism Supporting Japanese Fascism" and sang heroic songs such as "Unity is Strength." The student pickets then joined hands to form two lines of iron defense, guarding the patriotic行列, stepping forward in neat steps.

At 3 pm, more than 4,000 students gathered at Peking University's Democracy Square to hold the "North China Students' Anti-US Support for Japan and Rescue National Crisis Conference." Peking University Professor Fei Qing and others pointed out in their speeches: "Not only do we oppose the US policy of supporting Japan, but all Chinese people will rise up to oppose it."

Subsequently, under the leadership of the conference chairman, all the students solemnly swore an oath. More than 4,000 patriotic students recited in unison: "We students of North China will share weal and woe, unite as one, launch a peasant diplomacy movement, vow to oppose US support for Japan, and vow to oppose the selling out of national interests. For the independence of our country and the liberation of our nation, we are not afraid of blows and sabotage, and we will resolutely fight to the end." Finally, they returned to their respective schools amidst the heroic song of "Unity is Strength."

### 反对美国扶日政策抢救民族　北平学生“六九”示威  蒋家警宪出动枪刀林立古城　爱国青年洪流冲破警戒前进

　　反对美国扶日政策抢救民族
  　北平学生“六九”示威
    蒋家警宪出动枪刀林立古城
  　爱国青年洪流冲破警戒前进
    【新华社华北二十四日电】综合益世大公等平津报纸披露，北平学生六、九爱国反侵略进行情形如下：
    继平、津、唐数千学生五月三十日联合在北大举行反对美国扶日示威大会后，北平学生四千余人在六月九日又举行了壮烈的爱国示威游行。
    九日，北大、清华、燕京、师院、朝阳、中法、辅仁、华北学院、铁路学院九大院校宣布了总罢课。此讯传出后，蒋介石卖国政府即出动大批军队、警察、宪兵、特务，在各重要街道布成警戒线。美国领事馆在蒋军周密保护下紧闭大门，即其所在地“东交民巷”的进出口处，亦由警察戒严堵宪。整个古城笼罩在刀枪林立的恐怖氛围下。
    但蒋政府一切镇压威胁，阻止不了热血沸腾的青年的伟大爱国运动。清晨，游行队伍分由三处出动：第一路燕京、清华学生由西郊进城，曾一度被阻于西直门外。第二路中法、北大等校学生千余人在北大会合，冲破军警的多处警戒线英勇前进，沿途不少市民、店员自动参加了爱国游行行列。千百条年青的臂膀，在驶过的汽车、电车、三轮车以及两旁店铺的门壁上，写满反对美国扶日威胁中国的标语漫画。“反对美国扶日！”等口号声，象雷鸣一样，一阵一阵的响彻街巷。游行队伍途中遭大批警察、宪兵阻塞。学生们就在发亮的刺刀面前演出美国扶植下日本法西斯再度侵略中国的街头剧。剧情表演一个日本兵屠杀中国同胞和侮辱妇女的情形。古城的街头又听到被日本侵略者迫害的凄惨的呼号。这时候许多围观的市民都悲愤得流泪，甚至包围着学生的警察也忍不住偷偷揩眼睛。北平的人民没有忘却日本法西斯八年的血海深仇，他们决不能眼看着我们民族的死敌，又在美蒋勾结扶植的罪恶政策下重新壮大起来威胁中国。
    演过街头剧，第二路游行队伍至东安门又被全副武装的警察、宪兵和“防护团”重重包围。在蒋匪警备司令部稽查处长倪超凡，警察局长汤永威，宪兵十九团团长梅庆岚等法西斯头目亲自指挥下，警察宪兵等开枪阻止学生前进，但示威行列，在枪声中井然不乱，高度表现中国青年在爱国斗争中的英雄气概。
    由北平师范学院、北大四院（按系该校一年级新生校舍）等院校学生组成的第三路游行队伍，迎接了被阻在城外的第一路游行兄弟队伍燕京、清华同学入城。两路队伍汇成了一股钢铁的洪流，浩浩荡荡，直向东城前进，援助被包围的同学。爱国的歌声、口号声、震撼全城、到处贴满各种爱国漫画和标语。
    第二路游行队伍在东安门与宪警对持达四小时之久，直至下午一时五十分，获知一、三两路同学已会合赶到，于是，这些徒手的同学冒着宪、警的石头、木棍、皮带的殴打和第二次鸣枪恫吓，冲破了军警的阻拦。其中男女学生各二人头部被击重伤，十余人轻伤。马路上流淌着一滩一滩爱国者的热血，他们终于与其它两路同学在东华门胜利会合。
    两枝情同骨肉的爱国队伍会合后，全体高呼“打倒美帝国主义扶助日本法西斯”等爱国口号，并高唱“团结就是力量”等雄壮歌曲。学生纠察队于是又手挽着手结成两道铁的防线，拱卫着爱国行列，踏着整齐的步伐，继续前进。
    下午三时，四千余学生汇集在北大民主广场，举行“华北学生反美扶日抢救民族危机大会”。北大教授费青等在讲演中指出：“美国扶日政策不仅我们要反对，全中国人都会起来反对。”
    随后由大会主席领导全体学生庄严宣誓，四千余爱国学生同声朗诵着：“我们华北学生共甘苦、共患难，团结一致，展开农民外交运动，誓死反对美国扶植日本，誓死反对出卖国家民族的利益。为了我们国家的独立、民族的解放，我们不怕打击、破坏，坚决奋斗到底。”最后，在“团结就是力量”的雄壮歌声中各返原校。
