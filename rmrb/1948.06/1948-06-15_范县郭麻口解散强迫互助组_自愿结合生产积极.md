[Ji Lu Yu News] In Guo Ma Kou, First District of Fan County, with 94 households, a village-wide mutual aid system was forcibly organized last year. Based on the distance of residences, they were divided into areas, forming eight large teams. At the end of April in the Gregorian calendar, the district cadres came to this village to inspect production. Initially, no one would tell the truth and were afraid to mention anything. Later, the leadership clarified its position, stating that unreasonable mutual aid teams could be dissolved, and the masses' opinions were then reflected. Guo Qinxiu, with three able-bodied laborers, 22 mu of land, and one ox, said, "People are tied to the team for work, and they can't manage anything all year. If not, they could spare two people to do some business!" Most people in the mutual aid teams, working together, felt that those with less land and livestock were at a disadvantage. Even when the sun was high, they would still say the livestock hadn't eaten enough. Last year, a lot of sorghum stalks rotted in the fields, and no one bothered to bring them home. When it was time to work in the morning, it would take forever to gather everyone, and before they had been in the fields for a short while, it was already time for the afternoon. As soon as "afternoon" was mentioned, everyone would run faster than anyone else. Based on this situation, the leadership announced that the old mutual aid teams could be dissolved and let everyone deliberate. After eight or nine days of free deliberation, the masses democratically elected a new production committee, and six of the original eight large teams voluntarily dissolved. The leadership then promptly raised the question, "If people go out to repair dikes and carry stretchers, what will happen to the work at home?" The masses deliberated again and felt that it still wouldn't work without teams, so they freely found partners and formed 18 new teams. The largest group had six families, and most had three to five families. In the past, the land of several village cadres was evenly distributed to the team, and they themselves did not work. This time, with free combination, the masses did not look for them. Village cadres Guo Fuzhai, Guo Fuhai, and Wang Fucai eventually formed mutual aid teams with their relatives and close neighbors. In addition, there were several widowed women who also teamed up with their close relatives to take care of them. Someone asked Guo Wendong, "Are you losing out in the team?" He said, "Losing out? We are all willing to form teams." Guo Wenjing said, "Now my mind is clear, and no one depends on anyone else. In the past, two people would push the soil while three people thought about loading the cart. Now, everyone is working for themselves (in the past, in the forced mutual aid teams, they did little work for themselves and felt they were working for others), and no one wants to be lazy anymore!"

　　范县郭麻口解散强迫互助组
  　自愿结合生产积极
    【冀鲁豫讯】范县一区郭麻口，九十四户，去年强迫组织了全村大互助，按住的远近，分成片，成起来八大组。阳历四月底，小区干部到这村检查生产，开始谁也不给说实话，不敢提。后来领导上表明态度，提出不合理的互助组可解散，群众意见才反映出来。郭琴修三个整劳力，二十二亩地，喂一个牛。他说：“人都绑在组里做活，一年也不能治点任啥，要不是也能誊两个人作点买卖！”大部分互助组的人，在一起做活，地少有牲口的嫌吃亏，日头出了多高，他还说没喂饱牲口咧：去年很多秫秸叶烂到地里，也没谁往家弄；上晌做活的时候，半天还叫不齐人，到地里还没一会，又该下晌啦，一说下晌，谁比谁都跑的快。根据这种情形，领导上就宣布旧互助组可解散，并让大家酝酿。经过八九天的自由酝酿，由群众民主选举了新的生产委员会，旧有的八个大组有六个组自愿解散。领导上又及时提出来：“人们出去修堤、出担架，家里活怎样办呢？”群众又酝酿，大家觉得不成组还是不行，就随意各找对象，又结合成十八个新组。各组顶多的是六家，一般的是三、五家。过去几个村干部的地，都匀到组里，自己不做活。这次自由结合，群众都不找他。村干郭福斋、郭福海、王福财他们三个，最后和自己亲戚近门互助到一块。另外有几家寡妇，也是和近门子伙在一块，照顾她。有人问郭文东说：“你在组抱亏吗？”他说：“抱亏啥！俺都是甘心情愿成的组。”郭文镜说：“这回心眼可亮堂啦，谁也不靠谁啦，过去二人推土三个人想装车，这回都是给自己做活（过去强迫的互助组，做自己活少，都觉得自己是给别人干活）谁也不想懒啦！”（冀鲁豫日报）
