Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The puppet farce in Vietnam, directed by French imperialists and aided by American imperialists, began in Saigon on May 20th. A group of only thirty-seven traitorous Vietnamese politicians, under the direction of the French, became the heads of the Cochinchina Provisional Government, with Nguyen Van Xuan, raised by the French, as the chairman of the provisional government. This new government was recognized by the French Schuman government on the evening of May 26th, and the complete list of puppets was also announced on May 1st.

On September 23, 1945, French imperialists, with the joint assistance of British and Japanese troops, occupied Saigon, attempting to conquer the nascent Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh by force. However, the heroic Viet Minh People's Army, after a year and a half of hard fighting, shattered this attempt by the French. In early March 1947, the French government replaced its high commissioner in Vietnam, whose policy of forceful conquest had yielded no results, and appointed the radical socialist Pourier to implement a new plan of aggression against Vietnam, namely, military offensive on the one hand and the promotion of so-called "efforts by Vietnamese nationalists themselves to complete their work of crushing communism," that is, the plan of "using Vietnamese to control Vietnamese." This plan was drafted by American imperialist former ambassador to France, Bullitt. According to this plan, after April 1947, French imperialism began to organize Vietnamese puppets. Bao Dai, the former Annam king who had been raised by the French for a long time, surrendered to the Japanese during the war and became a Japanese puppet; after Japan's defeat, he announced his resignation on August 25, 1945, became the object of manipulation by Franco-American imperialists, attempting to deceive the Vietnamese people with Bao Dai's stinking signboard, at least hoping to divide the Vietnamese nation and alleviate the isolated and difficult position of the French in the war of aggression against Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese people, who have long suffered disasters and have awakened and united, and the strong Vietnamese People's Army, under the leadership of the Viet Minh, resolutely fight for the complete independence and freedom of Vietnam, so that the French imperialists' conspiracy to use Bao Dai, which has been planned for more than a year, has not yet been achieved. Now another lackey, Nguyen Van Xuan, who has been raised by the French for a long time, has come out first. This undoubtedly reflects the fact that the French aggressors, suffering from a serious political and economic crisis at home and a military crisis in Vietnam (whose main manifestation is a lack of fighting spirit), are in a very difficult situation, desperate, and finally adopting such a clearly ineffective "seeking divine help" method. But as the Viet Minh Radio stated on May 27th: Nguyen Van Xuan is merely a tool in the hands of the French, his sole purpose is to make Vietnamese slaughter Vietnamese, he will be eliminated by the current resistance movement, and his final fate will be the same as that of all colonialists, doomed to death.

### 法美制造越南傀儡　越盟表示一定要消灭它

　　法美制造越南傀儡
  　越盟表示一定要消灭它
    【新华社陕北二日电】由法帝国主义者所导演、美帝国主义所帮助的越南傀儡丑剧，于五月二十日开始在西贡上演。一群为数仅三十七人的卖国求荣的越南政客，在法帝指使下成为交趾支那临时政府的首脑，并以法帝豢养的阮文春为临时政府的主席。这个新政府已为法国舒曼政府于五月二十六日晚所认可，共全部傀儡名单亦于五月一日公布。
    一九四五年九月二十三日，法帝国主义者在英日军队联合协助下占领西贡，企图以武力征服胡志明领导下的新生的越南民主共和国。但英勇的越盟人民军，经过一年半的苦战，把法帝这一企图粉碎了。一九四七年三月初，法国政府撤换了它在越南执行武力征服的政策毫无结果的高级专员，任命急进社会党人波里埃去执行一个新的侵越计划，即一面军事进攻，一面推行所谓“使越南民族主义者自己去努力完成其粉碎共产主义的工作”，即“以越制越”的计划。这计划是美帝前驻法大使布立特所拟订的。根据这一个计划，一九四七年四月之后，法帝国主义就着手越南的傀儡组织，曾受法国豢养，战时投降过日本人当过日本傀儡；日本失败后，一九四五年八月二十五日宣告下野的前安南王保大，便成了法美帝国主义玩弄的对象，企图以保大这块臭招牌，欺骗越南人民，至少希望分化越南民族，减轻法帝在侵越战争中所处的孤立与困难的地位。但是久经灾难，已经觉醒与团结起来的越南人民，及坚强的越南人民军队，在越盟领导之下，坚决不移地为越南之完全独立与自由而斗争，以致法帝策划年余利用保大的阴谋，至今仍无所成就。现在另一个受法国长期豢养的奴才阮文春先行出场了。这无疑反映着在国内遭受严重政治经济危机，在越南又为军事危机（其主要表现就是士无斗志）所困恼的法国侵略者，在十分困难的处境中，穷极无聊，而终于采取这样明知无效的“求神拜佛”办法。但正如越盟电台五月二十七日所称：阮文春仅是法国手中的一个工具，他的唯一目的，是使越南人屠杀越南人，他将为目前正在进行的抵抗运动所消灭，他的最后命运将同一切殖民主义者的命运一样归于死亡。
