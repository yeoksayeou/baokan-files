　　Yuebei Prefectural Committee Issues Instructions
  　Vigorously Develop Communications Work
    [Taiyue News] Since the Party rectification in Yuebei, many cadres have been afraid of making "empty talk," afraid of causing problems, and afraid of being accused of showing off, resulting in a serious shortage of稿件 (manuscripts/articles) for the news agency. From mid-April to the end of May, in a month and a half, the Yuebei branch only received ninety稿件 (manuscripts/articles). Therefore, the Propaganda Department of the Yuebei Prefectural Committee issued a decision to develop communications work, instructing all counties to earnestly implement the following: (1) It is necessary to explain to all comrades that our advocacy of loyalty and honesty, and our opposition to false reports and "empty talk," is for the purpose of better serving the people. It does not mean that we are advocating not making reports or not writing稿子 (articles/pieces); on the contrary, we should more deeply discover problems, link with reality, summarize experiences, report to higher levels, and write稿子 (articles/pieces) for newspapers. For example, the稿子 (articles/pieces) written by comrades Wang Huaqing and Li Xianyou about Shangguan and Zhangzhuang were helpful to the work. Everyone should realistically summarize their work experience and report their work. (2) In order to specifically strengthen this work, the following must be done: (A) The county party committee office and all working groups should become fixed units for writing稿件 (articles/pieces), and should frequently and continuously write稿件 (articles/pieces). The head of the county party committee's propaganda department should be responsible for inspecting and supervising this work. (B) Responsible comrades at all levels should personally write稿件 (articles/pieces) to motivate others with their own example. They should also promote, commend, and reward those who write稿件 (articles/pieces) at various meetings, and educate everyone on how to write稿件 (articles/pieces). (C) Designate specific people to be responsible for writing稿件 (articles/pieces) in order to cultivate backbone correspondents and motivate the general public. It should be explained that writing稿件 (articles/pieces) is not only a good way to reflect the situation to higher levels, but also of great benefit to cultivating cadres, improving cadres' work ability and cultural level, meticulously collecting materials, and discovering problems. It should be considered a part of the overall work, not an extra burden. (3) Regarding rural communications groups, experiments can be carried out in experimental villages with work teams and working groups. In the past, it was thought that primary school teachers could not write anything worthwhile, but this understanding is inappropriate. In the future, they can be enabled to learn more about the work situation in the village, and write about whatever is being done in the village, gradually cultivating them and playing a bridging role for the rural communications groups, seeking the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants, and developing and establishing a broad rural communications network.

　　岳北地委发指示
  　好好开展通讯工作
    【太岳讯】岳北从整党以来，因为不少干部怕犯“客里空”、怕出问题、怕人说出风头，不敢写稿，造成通讯社的严重稿荒。从四月半到五月底一个半月中，岳北支社只收到稿件九十件。因此岳北地委宣传部特发出开展通讯工作的决定，指示各县认真执行：（一）必须向全体同志说明：我们提倡忠诚与老实，反对假报告，反对“克里空”，目的是为了更好的为人民服务，并不是提倡不作报告，不写稿子；相反更应深入发现问题，联系实际，总结经验，向上级报告，给报纸写稿。如王华青、李先有等同志所写的上官、张庄的稿子，对工作都是有帮助的。大家应实事求是的总结自己的工作经验，报导自己的工作。（二）为了具体加强这一工作，必须做到：（甲）县委办公室、各地工作组应成为固定的写稿单位，要经常的连续写作稿件，县委宣传部长应负责检查督促。（乙）各级负责同志应亲自动手写作，以自己推动别人，还要在各种会议上提倡、表扬、奖励大家写稿，并教育大家应如何写稿。（丙）指定专人负责写稿，以培养骨干通讯员，推动一般。说明写稿不仅是对上级反映情况的好办法，而且对培养干部，提高干部工作能力及文化水平、细致搜集材料、发现问题，都有很大的好处，应该认为是整个工作的一部分，不应认为是额外负担。（三）关于农村通讯组可在有工作团、工作组的实验村进行实验，过去认为小学教员写不出什么来，这种认识是不妥当的。今后可使他们多了解村里工作情形，村里做什就写什，慢慢培养他们，起农村通讯小组的桥梁作用。求得知识分子与工农结合，发展建立广大的农村通讯网。
