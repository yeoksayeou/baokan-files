　　Private Oil Mills Returned to Original Owners
　　Shangguan Oil Industry Revitalized
    [Taiyue News] In Shangguan Village, Qin County, the sideline of oil pressing used to be very developed. However, last year, when village cadres forced the entire village into large-scale mutual aid, they forcibly merged the four privately-run oil mills into the mutual aid group, and also stipulated that only those who participated in mutual aid could press oil. Furthermore, unreasonable oil pressing methods were prescribed, making it difficult for those who wanted to press oil to do so freely. The original oil mill owners were even more discouraged. Guo Kaoji said, "I spent ten *shi* of rice to buy my half set of equipment, and before I even got to use it, it belonged to the mutual aid group. Pressing one vat only yields fourteen *liang* of oil. I have no interest in mutual aid." Another owner, Zhang Zhongsu, said, "I won't even fix my equipment when it's broken. Whenever it completely breaks down, that's when it's over." Those selling oil for the mutual aid group were also dissatisfied, complaining about the lack of freedom. Some people sold out in half a day but had to wait until dark to return, just to get a full day's work credit. Some people complained that exchanging labor credits was too disadvantageous, and they started arguing. This wasted effort and reduced production. The year before last, the entire village pressed a total of eight hundred *zhuo* of oil, but now, after nearly a year of "mutual aid," they have pressed less than five hundred *zhuo*. The output of oil cakes alone has decreased by four thousand eight hundred. Based on these circumstances and repeated discussions by cadres and the masses, it was recognized that past actions were wrong. The oil mills were returned to their original owners, and the enthusiasm for production immediately increased. Some prepared to press oil independently, while others were re-negotiating and voluntarily forming partnerships after settling accounts. Zhang Ertu and Qin Sanxiao, after pressing oil every day, carried their loads to the countryside to sell. They happily said, "Now there's a way to make a living!" The oil mill owner Zhang Huxiao was also busy repairing his equipment. The masses who wanted to press oil were also negotiating terms with the oil mills. From morning till night, the oil mills pressed oil non-stop, and thirty loads of oil left for the countryside to be sold every day. The oil industry in Shangguan has been revitalized.

　　私人油坊退还原主
  　上官油业又活跃了
    【太岳讯】沁县上官村原来榨油副业很发达的，可是去年在村干部强迫全村大互助时，硬把私人经营的四座油坊归并到互助组搞，而且还规定了参加互助的人才能榨油；又规定了不合理的榨油办法，弄得要榨油的人不自由。原来的油房东家更灰山丧气，郭考吉说：“我那半套家具花十石米才买下，自己还没动弹就归了互助组，榨一咂只十四两油，我对互助没兴趣。”另一东家张中苏说：“我那家伙坏了也不修，他啥时坏完啥时算。”给互助组卖油的也不满意，嫌不自由。有的人半天就卖完了，要等天黑才回来，为的是能顶全工。有人嫌工顶工太吃亏，就吵起架来。这样浪费了工夫，还减少了生产。前年全村共榨了八百桌油，现在“互助”快一年了，榨了还不到五百桌。单油饼一项就少出了四千八百个。根据这些情况和干部群众反复开会讨论，认识过去作错了，把油坊退还了原主，生产劲头马上高了。有的准备单独自榨，有的在结束帐目重新自愿合伙经营。张二秃、秦三小两人，每天榨了油又挑担出乡，他们高兴的说：“这就有办法了。”油房东家张虎小也忙着修理家具。群众想榨油的也和油坊自搞条件。从早到晚，油坊不停的榨，每天有三十付油担子出乡卖油，上官的油业又活跃起来了。
