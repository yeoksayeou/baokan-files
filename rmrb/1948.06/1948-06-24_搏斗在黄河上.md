　　Fighting on the Yellow River
    Jun Qian
  　A Great Project
    The areas of Dong'a, Hexi, Qiyu and other four counties on the north bank of the Yellow River are low-lying, and the river channel is narrow, making it the section with the most dangerous works along the Yellow River. Last year, in order to prevent the Yellow River from overflowing and to resist Chiang Kai-shek for self-salvation, the masses in these counties contributed more than 86,000 cubic meters of stone. Dong'a County alone created the miracle of contributing more than 51,000 cubic meters of stone (each cubic meter weighing 4,000-5,000 kilograms), exceeding the amount of stone transported and used by Chiang and the Americans using modern tools to block the mouth of the Huayuankou. This is truly a matter of pride. The Dong'a section is the most dangerous section on the north bank of the Yellow River. In this section of 44 Chinese miles, there are 11 major and minor dangerous works; the largest dangerous works are at Fanpo, Wangpo, Niutun, and Weishan. Last year, under the harassment of enemy planes, the masses transported more than 51,000 cubic meters of stone from more than ten to dozens of miles away to the dangerous works, and under the continuous shooting and destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the opposite bank, they repaired the dangerous works and safely passed through last year's flood season. When the reporter inspected this section of dangerous works on May 25th, the two dangerous works of Fanpo and Wangpo were connected into one. From the first dam in the southwest of Fanpo to the last dam in the east of Wangpo, it is nearly eight miles long. This section of dangerous works is entirely built of stone, with a total of twelve stone dams, fifteen large-scale brushwood revetments, and twenty-five sections of stone revetments. The stone dams and stone revetments are more than five meters high. The revetments and dams are made of large stones on top of an earth base, with a base width of two meters and a top width of one meter, to resist the scouring of floodwaters and protect the embankments. But even this cannot prevent the occurrence of danger. Because the mischievous Yellow River water still scours the stones from underneath, and if the base is hollowed out, danger will still occur. Therefore, it is necessary to throw random stones several meters wide and one or two meters above the water surface under the dams and revetments to protect the stone-built dams and revetments. Standing on the top of the embankment and looking east and west, the neat, solid, and long stone revetments and stone dams extending into the water are like steep cliffs in the mountains. Building a city would not require so many stones. The huge waves of the flood rush in from the southwest, smashing into the solid stone dams and creating countless large and small whirlpools, rolling eastward along the winding river course. After last year's large-scale repairs and this year's continued repairs, the people are extremely confident in this year's flood control for this great and important project. The dangerous works of Niutun and Weishan, upstream of Fanpo and Wangpo, are also connected into one piece. Although it is only a little more than three miles long, its engineering scale is similar to that of Fanpo and Wangpo. Jieshan, on the opposite bank of Weishan, is only a small village, but it has prevented the southward development of the river channel. Together with the Dielizhuang embankment on the north bank, it tightly constricts the river channel to only half a mile wide. After the major repairs to the dangerous works of Niutun and Weishan last year, more than 5,000 cubic meters of stone have been transported this year in preparation for defense. There is also full confidence in this year's flood control here. This dangerous work is the most severely damaged by the Chiang bandits. In the past two months, enemy planes have strafed stone-transporting vehicles and harassed the workers repairing the dangerous works here, several times a day. In the past ten days alone, enemy planes dropped five large bombs on Weishan, but under the tenacious struggle of the people in our liberated areas, no matter how the Chiang bandits destroy it, it is useless.
　　Below Lakou Mountain
    Below Lakou Mountain is sixteen Chinese miles northeast of Pingyin City. The Yellow River flows at the foot of the mountain. The stone materials used for the various dangerous works along the river from here to Lijin County in the Bohai Sea region are mostly quarried from here. Since last year, Wang Yaowu's bandit troops in Jinan have frequently harassed and sabotaged the river management project. In May of this year, our Dong'a protection section seized the time to rush to transport stones. At 3:00 PM on the 12th, our three boats went to La Mountain to transport stones when several hundred bandits from the Second Security Brigade suddenly attacked, firing wildly with machine guns and rifles. Comrade Duan Lide, the material section member who led the stone transportation, was surrounded by the bandit troops and immediately bravely broke out. The communication orderly Wang Lide fired guns from the Hebei side to cover the safe return of a part of the sailors by a detour. The sailors on the two large boats in the middle of the river, in order to protect the boats, braved the shooting of the bandit troops and steered the boats down the rapids. The bandit troops were getting closer and closer, and hand grenades were about to be thrown onto the boat near the river. At this time, Zhou Li, a young woman from the Ninth District of Dong'a, and an elderly woman from Xiagou were returning from the market in Henan and encountered this situation. Zhou Li immediately jumped onto the boat to help pole the boat. She grew up by the river, knew how to read the water currents, and knew how to steer the boat. She lay diagonally on the boat board, gritted her teeth, and desperately paddled with the oar, also directing Yin Xinghai, who had poor eyesight, to paddle with the oar. Enemy bullets flew over the boat, and the enemy ordered them to steer the boat back, but they ignored them and continued to steer towards the north bank. At this time, the river defense armed forces of the Seventh District of Dong'a had heard the news and rushed to fight the enemy, finally covering the boat's safe passage. Zhou Li finally won. Now, under the efforts of the repair section and the laborers, the stone materials from La Mountain are still being transported to the dangerous works on the north bank.
　　The Embankment Was Finally Repaired
    On the afternoon of May 29th, I arrived at the Guanzhuang and Wulongtan dangerous works in Hexi County. To the southwest of Wuluzhuang on the opposite bank, stood a tall enemy bunker. On both sides of the bunker, there were also three pillboxes. These bunkers were facing the Guanzhuang and Wulongtan dangerous works. The enemy troops often searched for personnel repairing the brushwood revetments on the dangerous works, and fired upon discovering targets. Our river management personnel did not stop working because of this. I personally witnessed those loyal and strong engineering team members calmly and alertly carrying stones to repair the brushwood revetments. They told me, "None of us here have not been shot at, but we ignore that and continue to do our work. Last year was even worse, we couldn't work during the day, so we worked at night. The enemy also shot at night. In order not to let the enemy discover our targets, we took off our clothes at night and quietly worked."
　　Armed Escort for Emergency Repairs
    Qiyu County is the most downstream section of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, and it is also the section with the worst environment. To the northeast of this section, enemy troops from Qihe City frequently came out to harass, and each riverside village in the Hedong section had bunkers built by enemy troops from Changqing, who constantly shot at river management personnel. The struggle for Yellow River management here is extremely sharp and complex. In previous years, the method of repairing river embankments during the day and repairing temporary embankments near the Yellow River at night was adopted, creating a miracle in the history of Yellow River management. This year, although the enemy troops in Qihe are still coming out to harass, and the enemy troops on the riverbank are still shooting, the situation has greatly improved. When Qiyu started the first phase of embankment restoration this year, two battalions of the enemy 73rd Army were still stationed in Qihe City, frequently harassing. Our local armed forces drove out the enemy at Wulipu, five Chinese miles southwest of Qihe City, and surrounded the city to protect the emergency repairs.

　　搏斗在黄河上
    君谦
  　伟大的工程
    黄河北岸东阿、河西、齐禹等四县地势低洼，河身狭窄，为黄河险工最多的一段。这几县的群众，去年为防黄反蒋自救，献石达八万六千余方，东阿一县创造了献石五万一千余方（每方石四、五千斤）的奇迹，超过了蒋美以现代化工具运石堵塞花园口的数目。这真是值得骄傲的事。东阿段是黄河北岸最险要的一段。这一段在四十四华里中，大小险工十一处；最大的险工是范坡、王坡、牛屯、魏山等处。去年群众在匪机袭扰下，将五万一千余方石头，从十多里至数十里外运到险工上，又在对岸蒋军日夜射击破坏下，将险工抢修好，安然渡过了去年的大汛期。当五月二十五日记者巡视这段险工时，范坡和王坡两个险工连筑成一个。从范坡西南的第一坝到王坡东的最后一坝，将近八里长。这段险工完全用石修成，共有十二道石坝，十五个大盘埽，廿五段石护沿。石坝和石护沿都有五公尺多高。护沿和坝是在土基之外大块石头砌成，底宽二公尺、顶宽一公尺，以抗拒洪水的冲刷，掩护堤坝。但这样还不能免于出险。因为作怪的黄水，还要从底下刷石，底被掏空，仍要出险。于是又不得不往坝及护沿下面，抛数公尺宽、高出水面一、二公尺的乱石，以掩护石砌的坝和护沿，我站在堤顶往东西两面望去，那整齐、坚固、漫长的石头护沿和伸入水中的石坝象山间的陡崖峭壁，筑一座城也用不了那么多的石头。堤坝顶上还整齐的陈列着一垛垛的石料，这是今年运来的七千多方，以作不时之需的。洪水巨浪从西南扑来，被坚固的石坝迎头撞得粉碎，打着无数个大小漩涡，顺着弯曲的河势往东滚去。这个伟大险要的工程经过去年的大规模抢修和今年的续修，人民对于今年的防汛是极有信心的。牛屯和魏山险工，在范坡、王坡上游也连成一片了。它虽然只有三里多长，但它的工程规模是和范坡、王坡差不多的。魏山对岸的解山，只是个很小的村庄，但却阻止了河身的向南发展，它和北岸的堤列庄，将河身紧束得只有半里多宽。牛屯和魏山险工，在去年大修后，今年又已运到五千余方备防石。今年的防汛在这里也有了充分的把握。这个险工是蒋匪破坏最厉害的一处。最近两个月内，匪机在这里扫射运石车辆，袭扰修险员工，每天总有好几次。只最近十天以内，匪机投在魏山的大炸弹就有五枚，但在我解放区人民顽强斗争之下，不管蒋匪怎样破坏都是无用的。
　　腊口山下
    腊口山下在平阴城东北十六里，黄河就在山脚下流过。从这里到渤海区的利津县，沿河各险工所用的石料，多从这里开凿。去年以来，济南王耀武匪军经常窜扰破坏治河工程。今年五月，我东阿防护段抓紧抢运石块，十二日下午三时，我三只船又到腊山运石，匪保二旅数百人突然袭来，用机步枪疯狂扫射。领导运石的材料股员段立德同志遭到了匪军的包围，当即奋勇冲出，通讯员王立德则在河北打枪，掩护一部水手安全绕道返回。到了中流的两只大船上的水手们，为了保护船只，冒着匪军的扫射，顺急流将船驶下。匪军越逼越近，手榴弹已将要投到靠河的小船上了，这时东阿九区一青年妇女周李氏和夏沟的一位老年妇女正从河南赶集回来，遇着这个事情，周李氏立刻跳到船上，帮助撑船，她生长在河边，会看水势，又会驶船，便斜躺在船板上，咬着牙，狠命的用摆子划着，还指挥着眼睛不好的尹行海划摆子。匪军的子弹从船上飞叫，匪军命令将船划回去，她们没有理那一套，仍是一个劲的往北岸驶来，这时东阿七区的河防武装已经闻讯赶来，痛击匪军，才将船掩护过来，周李氏终于胜利了。现在腊山的石料，在修防段和民工的努力下，仍源源运到北岸险工上来。
　　到底把堤修好了
    五月二十九日下午，我到了河西县的官庄和五龙潭险工，对岸雾露庄的西南，高耸着匪军的一座碉堡，碉堡的两边还有三个地堡，这些碉堡正对着官庄和五龙潭险工。匪军经常搜寻着险工上修埽的人员，发现目标就射击。我们的治河人员并没有因此停止工作，我亲眼见到了那些忠勇健壮的工程队员，沉着机警的抬石修埽。他们告诉我说：“我们这些人没有一个没有挨过打的，可是我们不理那一套，我们还是做我们的工，去年更坏，白天是不能干活，我们就在夜间干，夜间敌人也打枪，我们为了不叫敌人发现目标，就在夜间脱了衣服，悄悄的干。”
　　武装掩护抢修
    齐禹县是冀鲁豫区黄河最下游的一段，也是环境最坏的一段。这段的东北方有齐河城的匪军经常出扰，河东段每个沿河村，都有长清匪军筑的碉堡，他们不停的射击治河人员。这里的治黄斗争是极其尖锐和复杂的。几年曾采用了白天修河堤，夜晚修临黄堤办法，创造了治黄史上的奇迹。今年齐河的匪军虽然还在出扰，河岸匪军虽然还在射击，但局面是大见好转了。今年齐禹开始第一期复堤时，齐河城还驻有匪七三军的两个营，经常出扰。我地方武装乃驱逐了齐河城西南五里铺敌人，将城团团围困起来，掩护抢修。
