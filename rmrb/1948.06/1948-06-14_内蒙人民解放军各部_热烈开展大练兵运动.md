Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th: Several units of the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army have recently launched a fervent great military training movement. The Party Committee of the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army has called on the entire army to create more model companies. The conditions are: In addition to being fast and accurate in grenade throwing, the average distance per person in the entire company must exceed ×× meters; in shooting, each person in the entire company must achieve an average of ×× rings or more with five shots. In addition, it is also necessary to pay attention to hygiene and care for war horses. Currently, a training upsurge has been set off in various departments, and all commanders and fighters have responded to the call with extremely high morale. The Third Company of a certain regiment, in addition to stipulating standards for shooting and grenade throwing according to the specific conditions of the company, also proposed to feed the horses strong, prevent them from getting sick, and improve their horsemanship from "jumping up and down" to "flying up and down," while also paying attention to cleanliness and completely eliminating the sick. In the machine gun company of a certain unit, banners such as "Model Training Squad," "Model Cleanliness Squad," and "Model Horse Loving Squad" have launched a fervent flag-winning competition among the squads and platoons, resulting in rapid progress. During live ammunition shooting, excellent shooters who hit full marks have emerged, and the grenade throwing distance has sometimes doubled, with the highest being over sixty meters. In the training, each company has promoted military democracy, and some companies have even sent observation groups to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and actively promote the movement.
