Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary by Masinu on the 4th, exposing the U.S. imperialists' collaboration with Chiang Kai-shek to help revive Japanese aggressive forces. The commentary stated: U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal recently released the report of the Johnston Committee (this report was formulated in March by a committee sent by the U.S. government to Japan and South Korea, led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Draper and Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman, with Johnston as the committee secretary. It is said that because the report was drafted by Johnston, the U.S. government released it as the "Johnston Report," generally referred to as the "Draper Plan"), advocating the immediate, unrestricted, and rapid restoration of Japan's military industrial potential and further reducing the number of Japanese reparations factories. According to this plan, Japan opens its doors wide to allow American capital to flow in and for American capital to control Japanese industry, with 51% of the shares of Japanese Konzerns to be transferred to Americans. This is the basic condition for the United States to help Japan revive and become a "Far East industrial manufacturer." The commentary pointed out that the U.S. pro-Japan plan is based on enslaving the various nations of the Far East. Johnston proposed increasing Japanese exports ninefold, to 1.575 billion U.S. dollars per year. Japanese newspapers openly wrote: The realization of this plan will depend on whether pre-war colonial economic relations are restored in Asia. The Japanese "Economic Daily" more bluntly stated: "The inadequacy of the economic strength of various countries is the basis for Japan's economic invasion of Far Eastern countries." The Johnston Report emphasized that "Japan's economy will depend on establishing close ties and cooperation with Far Eastern countries." This is also the meaning. The commentary then cited news from Chinese newspapers, showing that increasingly large quantities of Japanese goods are flowing into the Kuomintang-controlled areas, while the Kuomintang government is constantly increasing the supply of raw materials to Japan. On May 29th, Ta Kung Pao reported: Kuomintang Guangdong Province Chairman Song Ziwen and the newly appointed Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao decided to transport 100,000 tons of Hainan Island iron sand to Japan (Note: The former Kuomintang government has signed a contract with the U.S. military headquarters to transport 250,000 tons of Hainan Island iron sand to Japan this year - Editor). According to Hong Kong's "Chinese Business Daily," Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are paying great attention to this issue. They decided to protest to Song Ziwen against selling Hainan Island's resources to revive Japan. Chinese newspapers have recorded many reports about how Japan is eager to use Hainan Island's iron ore to restore Japan's military industrial potential. After MacArthur introduced Horiuchi Kanjō, a major Japanese war criminal who invaded China, to Song Ziwen as an advisor, he introduced three more Japanese (Note: Takeuchi Kengo, president of the Japanese Asahi Industrial Company, Kinrai Yōichi and Okada Genkura, members of the Taihei Industrial Company - Editor) to South China, who arrived in Hainan Island at the end of April. In the future, a large number of Japanese technicians will be sent to the island. The commentary mentioned the current patriotic movement of Chinese students opposing the U.S. pro-Japan policy, saying: When the U.S. plan for Japan is clearly exposed, this movement has developed particularly strongly.

　　美帝扶日计划越更明显
  　中国爱国运动愈加强大
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科电台四日广播马西努评论，揭露美帝国主义者与蒋介石合力扶助日本侵略势力复活。评论略称：美陆军部长罗雅尔最近公布了约翰斯顿委员会的报告（该报告系三月间美政府派赴日韩的委员会所制订，该委会系美陆次德莱柏与经济合作局长官霍夫曼所率领，约翰斯顿为该委会秘书，据称因报告系由约翰斯顿手拟，故美政府公布为“约翰斯顿报告”，一般则称之为德莱柏计划），主张立即无限制的和迅速的恢复日本军事工业潜力，并更加减少日本赔偿工厂数额。按照这个计划，日本大开门户让美国资本流入，并由美国资本统治日本工业，日本康采恩的股票百分之五十一应转为美国人所有。这就是美国帮助日本复兴，使其成为“远东工业制造厂”的基本条件。评论指出美国的扶日计划是以奴役远东各民族为其基础的。约翰斯顿提议使日本输出增加九倍，增加到每年十五万万七千五百万美元。日本报纸公开写道：这个计划的实现，将依靠在亚洲是否恢复战前的殖民经济关系。日本“经济日刊”更露骨地说：“各国经济力量的不足，是日本经济侵入远东国家的基础”。约翰斯顿报告中强调指出的“日本的经济将依赖与远东各国建立密切联系与合作。”也正是这个意思。评论继引证中国报纸消息，显示：日益增加的日货正大量流入国民党统治区，同时国民党政府供给日本的原料亦不断增加。五月二十九日大公报报导：国民党广东省主席宋子文和新任行政院长翁文灏决定运送十万吨海南岛铁砂给日本（按：前国民党政府已与美军总部签订合同，本年内以二十五万吨海南岛铁砂运日——编者）。据香港华商报消息：香港的中国企业家对这个问题予以很大注意。他们决定向宋子文提出抗议，反对为复兴日本出卖海南岛富源。中国报纸记载过不少的消息，说日本如何渴望利用海南岛铁矿恢复日本军事工业潜力。麦克阿瑟在将日本侵华要犯堀内干城介绍给宋子文当顾问后，又将三名日本人（按：为日本朝日工业社长竹内健吾、太平工业社员进来要一及冈田原仓——编者）介绍来华南，他们已于四月底到达海南岛。今后将还有大批日本技师派往该地。该评论说到目前中国学生反对美国扶日政策的爱国运动称：当美国对日计划明显暴露的时候，这种运动有了特别强大的发展。
