　　Actively Fight Against Enemy Disasters and Natural Disasters
  　Shouyang Reclaims Over 10,000 Mu of Wasteland
    [Taihang News] Shouyang, located in the border area, has expanded its cultivated land area by more than 13,000 mu this spring. In the past year, due to enemy disasters, natural disasters, and our leftist errors in policy implementation, the masses' enthusiasm for production was low, the labor force and livestock decreased, and a lot of land was left barren. This spring, through mobilizing production for disaster relief and correcting deviations, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been enhanced. The whole county has reclaimed more than 4,600 mu of virgin land and more than 8,900 mu of cultivated wasteland (excluding land that was not planted last year), totaling more than 13,500 mu of virgin and cultivated wasteland. The county's more than 26,000 people have increased their land holdings by an average of more than half a mu per person. In addition, according to statistics from 34 villages (out of the county's 51 villages), the land that was not planted last year but was planted this year has increased by more than 15,900 mu compared to last year. Taking the second district as an example, the total land is more than 38,000 mu, the land planted last year was more than 21,600 mu, and the land planted this year is more than 33,000 mu, with an average increase of 1.85 mu per person. This spring, the rainfall has been even, and the whole county has completed the autumn planting, except for naked oats and buckwheat. Recently, the special commissioner of the county government went to Heshun to purchase and exchange more than 60 jin of naked oats and buckwheat seeds, which are now being prepared for transport back.

　　积极与敌灾天灾斗争
  　寿阳开荒万余亩
    【太行消息】边沿区寿阳，今春扩大耕地面积一万三千多亩。一年来，由于敌灾天灾，加上我们在执行政策中的左倾错误，群众生产情绪低落，劳畜力减少，土地荒芜不少。今春经发动生产救灾，并结合纠偏，群众生产积极性提高。全县开垦生荒四千六百多亩，开垦熟荒（不包括去年未下种的地）八千九百多亩，总共开垦生熟荒一万三千五百多亩，全县二万六千多人，平均每口人增加半亩多地。此外据三十四个村统计（全县五十一村），去年未下种而今年下种的地，较去年多增加一万五千九百多亩。就二区来看，总共土地三万八千多亩，去年下种地二万一千六百多亩，今年已下种地三万三千多亩，每口人平均增种地一亩八分五。今春雨水调匀，全县除莜麦荞麦外，已完成秋地下种。日前县府特派员到和顺购换莜、荞麦种籽六十多斤，现正准备运回。
