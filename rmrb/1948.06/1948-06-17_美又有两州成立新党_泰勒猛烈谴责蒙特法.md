Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, New York - The states of New Jersey and Rhode Island in the United States have recently established Progressive Parties. The Newark (in New Jersey) conference, attended by 1,200 delegates, formally adopted the establishment of the New Jersey "Independent Progressive Party." The conference also adopted a program opposing monopolies, striving for peace, and guaranteeing full support for Wallace's candidacy. The conference also convened a mass rally of 50,000 people in support of Wallace. The founding conference of the Rhode Island Progressive Party was held in Providence. Third Party Vice-Presidential candidate Senator Taylor delivered a speech at the meeting, fiercely condemning the Mundt-Nixon Bill. (Note: The American Third Party does not yet have a formal national name. The new parties established in various states are sometimes called Progressive Parties, sometimes Independent Progressive Parties, and sometimes People's Progressive Parties. The formal national name of the Third Party is still to be decided at the party's July conference.)
