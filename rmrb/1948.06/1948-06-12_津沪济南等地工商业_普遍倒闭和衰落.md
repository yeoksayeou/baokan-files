Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. A synthesis of various sources: Industry and commerce in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are universally facing the serious situation of collapse and business decline. At the beginning of last month, the average daily business income of the six major department stores in Shanghai, including the famous Wing On and Sincere, totaled less than 5 billion yuan. Among them, Sincere Co. Ltd., The Sun, China Emporium and Lihua only earned 500 to 600 million yuan per day, while daily expenses were almost half of the business income, making it difficult to maintain operations. As of the end of April, two-thirds of the city's cigarette factories had completely or partially suspended work. The city's cigarette production in March was 120,000 cases, but in the first half of April, it had been reduced to 30,000 cases. According to people in the industry, the main reason for the crisis is the heavy burden of donations and taxes. The tax rate on cigarette goods has been increased to 100% of the original price. Tianjin's sock-weaving industry has been unable to sustain itself due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' monopoly on cotton yarn. Before the war, there were 200 hand-knitting sock factories, but now there are less than 100. Only two machine-knitting sock factories remain. The production of socks at the Daxin factory has sharply decreased from 300 dozen per day to 145 dozen. The daily sales of the Dazhong Sock Factory are about 100 pairs, a decrease of three times compared to before. In Jinan, more than 400 factories and shops closed down in January and February this year, and more than 100 more applied for closure by the end of April. Bengbu, a commercial center in northern Anhui, is also seeing the closure of various businesses and shops under the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In March alone, the major business closures included Da Xing Cotton Yarn and Pigment Store, Hua Xin Printing House, Tai Fu Pigment Store, Sheng Tai Cotton Cloth Store, Yu Heng Xie Ji Store, Yu Cheng Silk Cloth Store, and Yu Feng Cheng Ji Store, among others. Many smaller shops and stores also closed down.

　　津沪济南等地工商业
  　普遍倒闭和衰落
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合各方消息：蒋区工商业普遍陷于倒歇及营业衰落的严重情境。上月初，沪市著名的永安、先施等六大百货公司，每日平均营业收入，合计已不到五十亿，其中新新、大新、国货、丽华四家，则每日仅收入五六亿元，而每日开支竟几达营业收入之半数，均感难以维持。全市卷烟工厂，至四月底，全部与局部停工的已达总数的三分之二。三月份全市卷烟生产量为十二万箱，至四月上半月，则已减产至三万箱。据该业人士称：造成危机的主要原因，为捐税负担太重，卷烟货物税的税率，已提高至原价的百分之百。天津织袜工业，因受蒋匪当局垄断，棉纱的打击，已无法维持。手工织袜厂战前有二百家，现已不足一百家，机器织袜厂，仅存两家，大新工厂产袜量，已从每日三百打，锐减至一百四十五打，大众袜厂每日销量一百双左右，较前减少三倍。济南各种工厂、商号，今年一二月份倒闭达四百余家，至四月底又有百余家要求歇业。皖北商业中心蚌埠，在蒋匪压榨下，各业商号，亦纷纷倒闭。三月份内仅大商号倒闭者，即有大兴棉纱颜料号，华新印刷所，泰福颜料庄，盛泰棉布号，裕恒协记号，裕诚绸布庄，裕丰诚记号等七家，其他较小之商店行庄停业者更多。
