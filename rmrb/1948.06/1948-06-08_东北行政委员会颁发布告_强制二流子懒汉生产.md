Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th. The Northeast Administrative Committee, chaired by Chairman and Vice-Chairmen Lin Feng, Zhang Xuesi, and Gao Chongmin, has issued a public notice mandating that vagrants (loafers) participate in production. The notice begins by stating: Since the land reform in the Northeast Liberated Areas, the feudal system has been completely destroyed politically and economically. The broad masses of farmers are actively launching a large-scale production movement to support the revolutionary war and carry out the economic construction of the Liberated Areas. However, it has recently been discovered that some vagrants in various places are being poisoned by the remnants of the feudal classes, idling their time away, and not engaging in production, becoming parasites of the new society. Some even resort to theft and gambling for a living. This not only violates the purpose of the land reform but also hinders the establishment of a democratic social order. All localities should pay serious attention to this phenomenon and take effective measures to overcome it. The notice further announces: From now on, all vagrants who consistently do not participate in production must be forced to participate in labor and production. Those who live by theft and gambling, or who use opium and other drugs and refuse to quit, or who use the slogan of "democracy" to disregard the law and have acts that hinder production, shall be punished according to the law. All those who abandon their land due to idleness shall have their land licenses temporarily suspended. The notice concludes by calling on governments at all levels to be earnestly responsible for conducting both persuasion and education, and also for carrying out necessary legal sanctions, rewarding those who work hard and increase production, and punishing those who are idle and parasitic.

    【新华社东北四日电】东北行政委员会顷由正副主席林枫、张学思、高崇民签署颁发布告，强制二流子（懒汉）生产。布告首称：东北解放区自土地改革以后，在政治与经济上，已彻底摧毁了封建制度，广大农民，正在积极开展大生产运动，以支援革命战争，进行解放区的经济建设，惟最近发现各地有些二流子竟薰染封建阶级的余毒，游手好闲，不事生产，成为新社会的寄生虫，甚至还有以盗窃赌博为生者，不但违反了土改的宗旨，也妨害了民主社会秩序的建立，各地对这种现象，应引起严重注意，并采取有效的克服办法。布告继宣布：今后凡一贯不参加生产的二流子，必须强制他们参加劳动生产，对于以盗窃赌博为生及吸食鸦片毒品而不戒除者，或利用“民主”口号目无法纪而有妨害生产行为者，应一律依法惩处。一切因游惰而荒废土地者，应即暂行停发土地执照。布告最后号召各级政府，必须切实负责一面进行说服教育，并且进行必要的法律制裁，对勤劳增产者奖励，游惰寄生者惩处。
