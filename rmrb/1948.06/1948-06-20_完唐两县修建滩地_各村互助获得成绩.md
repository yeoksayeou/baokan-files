[Chahar News] Wanquan and Tangxian counties in the upper reaches of the Tang River have achieved results in building滩地. The two counties have a total of forty-nine 滩地 villages, with a 滩地 area of 18,531 mu, accounting for 70% of the total 滩地 along the Tang River. Currently, crops include 10,034 mu of wheat, 8,147 mu of barley, 150 mu of indigo, and 200 mu of other special crops. Since the establishment of the Tang River 滩地 Management Committee in April, river disputes have been greatly reduced. Thanks to the establishment of joint village committees, there has also been improvement in mutual assistance and unity among the villages. The greatest achievement has been in the construction of protective embankments. The original plan was to build 29 dikes, 8 dams, reinforce 14 "卧牛子" (lying ox structures), build 7 sluice gates, construct 40 canals, and plant 4,990 trees for embankment protection. Now, except for 4 dikes still lacking and only 200 trees having survived, the rest has been completed. Some even exceeded the original plan, such as the excavation and repair of 120 canals, which is three times the original plan. The work in Beihongcheng Village is the best, with village cadre Wang Luoqi enthusiastically urging and leading, completing and exceeding the original plan in ten days. Through this renovation, the 滩地 has become more consolidated. Currently, according to the changes in agricultural seasons, the management committee has decided that the focus of leadership in the second stage is to organize water usage, in order to save labor, balance benefits, and increase production. The main method is to assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for appropriately controlling the distribution of water volume according to the distance, nature, and elevation of the 滩地. Beneficiary households should establish systems and self-define covenants. No one should open or close ditches and gates without authorization, overcoming the problem of a few people harming others for their own benefit. Violators will be punished according to the covenants.

　　完唐两县修建滩地
    各村互助获得成绩
    【察哈尔讯】唐河上游完、唐两县修建滩地获成绩。该两县共有四十九个滩地村庄，滩地面积一万八千五百三十一亩，当全唐河滩地的百分之七十。现在作物计有小麦一万零三十四亩，大麦八千一百四十七亩，蓝靛一百五十亩，其他特种作物二百亩。自四月份成立唐河滩地管理委员会以来，河道纠纷大大减少。由于联村委员会的设置，各村在互助团结上也有改进。护滩建设方面成绩最大，原计划修堤二十九道，修坝八道，垒卧牛子十四处，修水闸七处，修渠四十道，造护滩林四千九百九十棵，现除修堤尚缺四道，只栽活二百棵树外，其余全部完成。有的超过原计划，如挖整渠道已完成一百廿道，相当原计划的三倍。北洪城村工作最好，村干部王洛齐热心督促领导，十天中即彻底完成与超过了原计划。经这一次的修整，滩地更加巩固了。目前管委会根据农时季节的转变，决定第二阶段的领导重心是组织使水，借以节省劳力，平衡受益，增加生产。主要办法是设专人负责，按滩地的远近、性质、高低适当掌握分配水量，由受益户规定制度自定公约，沟闸不得擅自开放或闭塞，克服少数人损人利己的毛病，违者按约处罚。
