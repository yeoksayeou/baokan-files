Voluntary Combination, Flexible Work Point System
Zhangzhuang Mutual Aid Increasingly Consolidated

[Our Dispatch] Zhangzhuang is a village in Xingtai's First District with a relatively solid foundation in mutual aid production. Last year, 109 households formed 13 mutual aid groups, implementing a work-point system based on "xiǎng" (a unit of time). Some groups even transitioned to sideline production after the autumn harvest. However, some groups had unclear accounts, which affected the development and consolidation of mutual aid. This spring, village cadres, due to misunderstandings of the Party rectification policy, mostly "lay down" and did not lead production. At this time, district cadres came to the village, restored mutual aid, and helped formulate a wheat hoeing and sowing plan. But due to a lack of specific leadership and failure to resolve outstanding account issues from the previous year, mutual aid was still not very vigorous. Later, village chief Shen Hongzhi and militia director Shen Xuelin returned from training in the county, understood the Party rectification policy of "treating the illness to save the patient," resolved their confused thinking of being afraid of making mistakes and not working, and apologized to the masses for not leading the mutual aid groups in the spring, causing the masses to suffer losses in production. Next, they examined last year's mutual aid, cleared wages, and, under the direct guidance of the district, established a production committee to uniformly lead production. In addition to the four main village cadres, four other members (two poor peasants, two middle peasants) were selected from the masses to participate. During the rush of the wheat harvest, all but seven of the village's 139 households participated in mutual aid. 140 male laborers and 161 female laborers were organized, accounting for 91.7% of the village's total male and female labor force. Only one cow in the village did not participate in mutual aid. In the past, during the wheat harvest, the village had to find at least 50 short-term laborers every day, taking five days to complete. This year, despite a reduction of more than 30 young and strong laborers who joined the army, it was completed in four days, saving a total of 250 workdays. The masses deeply felt that mutual aid was very beneficial.

This year's mutual aid in Zhangzhuang is based on voluntary combination. For example, Shen Manni's group had nine households last year, but three households withdrew this time. One household lived too far away from most of the group members, making it inconvenient to attend meetings at night, so they joined a nearby mutual aid group. One was a military family whose land was mostly cultivated by others, leaving little land for self-cultivation and they wished to cultivate it themselves. One was a loafer who did not change despite repeated persuasion and education from the group, so they were temporarily asked to leave.

Last year's mutual aid implemented a "xiǎng" ticket system, with work points determined by "xiǎng". One laborer was equal to one laborer. Some people reflected that good laborers were at a disadvantage, and lazy ones benefited. This year's mutual aid has improved. Thirteen of the fifteen groups have implemented a "fixed points, flexible determination" system: work points for the day are determined based on the day's labor situation. If the labor is good in the first half of the day, more points are awarded; if the labor is poor in the second half of the day, or if they arrive late, fewer points are awarded. This flexible work point system greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the group members. Previously, some relatively lazy people, or those who liked to take advantage, now arrive in the fields very early without the need for the group leader to urge them. One day during the wheat harvest, Shen Shazi got up very early and harvested a lot before others came to work, and he earned twelve points that day. Three women in Shen Hongzhi's group participated in wheat harvesting and earned ten points each every day. Shen Mutou earned eighteen points one day. Some groups stipulate that the highest standard is ten points, and they elect the best laborer each day as the standard, and those who are slightly less are appropriately reduced, which also encourages everyone's production enthusiasm. Every night, the mutual aid groups exchange point tickets, discuss the work for the next day, and stipulate that after completing a section of work, they will settle accounts and clear wages. Some groups stipulate that regular criticism and self-criticism meetings should be held to review everyone's labor situation and whether the points are fairly determined. Accounts are settled and wages are cleared every ten days.

During the wheat harvest, the Shen Hongzhi and Liang Haojun groups also experimented with the method of contracting work by land. The homeowner proposed how many workdays were needed for a plot of land, and the group discussed and agreed to contract it. The homeowner issued point tickets according to the stipulated number and handed them over to the mutual aid group. He himself still participated in the group's harvesting, earning point tickets in the same way. Everyone thought about earning more point tickets, further accelerating the work.

Women and children actively participated in the wheat harvest and hoeing. Women without children went to the fields to cut wheat, and women with children stayed at home to cook and deliver meals. After the harvest, the men plowed and hoeed the fields, and the women mainly did the work in the threshing ground. Shen Hongzhi's mother, who is over fifty years old, also participated in wheat harvesting, earning seven points on the first day. Later, she also worked with the children, hoeing 50.6 mu of seedlings in six days. Three children could earn ten points each day, and their enthusiasm for production was very high, and no one wanted to lag behind. The disadvantage is that children are organized separately, and it is not convenient to be separated from their parents, and they cannot learn how to work, and they are now preparing to be reorganized into farmer mutual aid groups.

Two problems were discovered from the mutual aid in this village: One is the decision on the order of doing work. Some groups used the lottery method, which the leadership discovered and pointed out was not fair. The order should be determined according to the urgency of the work in the fields. Some groups accepted this opinion, but some groups proposed that if the hoeing is done late, and the grass grows vigorously after a rain, what should be done if the work is more laborious? The groups fully discussed this opinion and determined that the order should still be determined according to the work. If it rains and the work is more laborious, the extra work will be borne by the group and not by the homeowner.

Another is that some groups give military families' cultivated land to the substitute cultivator to do the work alone, and some groups uniformly help each other to cultivate even the cultivated land, and the original substitute worker pays point tickets according to the work. The latter method is better, and the leadership has paid attention to its promotion.

　　自愿结合灵活订分
  　张庄互助日趋巩固
    【本报讯】张庄是邢台一区互助生产比较有基础的村庄。去年有一百零九户组成十三个互助组，实行了按响计工。有些组且在秋后转入了副业生产。但是有的组算帐不清，影响了互助的发展与巩固。今年春天，村干部因为对整党政策有误解，大部躺倒了，不去领导生产。这时有区干部来到这村，恢复了互助，还帮助订了锄麦下种计划。但因缺乏具体领导，又没有清理去年遗留的帐目问题，互助还是很不起劲。以后村长沈洪志、武委会主任沈学林从县里受训回来，认识了治病救人的整党政策，解决了怕犯错误不干工作的糊涂思想，向群众检讨了自己一春天没领导互助组，使群众在生产中受了损失的毛病，接着检查去年互助，清理工资，并在区直接指导下，成立统一领导生产的生产委员会，除了四个主要村干，在群众中另选出四个委员（贫农二，中农二）参加。该村在突击麦收时，全村一百三十九户除七户外都参加了互助。组织起来男劳力一四○个，女劳力一六一个，占全村男女总劳力的百分之九十一点七。全村只一头牛没参加互助。过去麦收时，每天全村至少得觅短工五十人，需五天完成。今年麦收，减少了三十多名参军的青壮劳力，但是四天就完成了，共省工二百五十个。群众深感互助得利不小。
    今年张庄的互助是自愿结合的。如沈满妮组去年有九户，这次退出三户，一户住地与大部组员相距过远，晚上开会不方便，参加了相近的互助组了。一户是军属，大部土地叫人代耕，留地很少愿自种。一个是二流子，组里屡次劝说教育不改，暂时请他出去。
    去年互助，实行了晌票制，按晌定分。一个劳力顶一个劳力。有的群众反映：好劳力吃亏，赖的沾光。今年互助提高了一步，十五个组有十三个实行了死分活订：按当天的劳动情形订当天的分。前半晌劳动的好，多订分，后半晌劳动的差，或来的晚了，就少订分，这种灵便订分法，大大提高了组员的生产情绪，从前个别比较懒惰的，或爱占小便宜的，现在不用组长催叫，都很早到地里去了。有一天割麦，沈傻子起了一个大早，割了许多别人才来上工，那天他挣到十二分。沈洪志组有三个妇女参加割麦，每天各挣到十分，沈木头有一天挣到十八分。有几个组规定最高标准是十分，每天评选一次，以劳动最好的为标准，稍次的人酌情减少，也鼓励了大家的生产情绪。每晚互助组交换分票，讨论明天的活，并规定做完一段活，即结帐清理工资。有的组规定定期开检讨会，检讨每人的劳动情形，定分是否公平等。十天算一回帐，清理工资。
    麦收时，沈洪志、梁好俊两个组还试行了按地包工办法，按地块由主家提出需要几个工，组里讨论，同意了就包下，主家按规定数目出分票；交给互助组，他本人仍参加组内收割，同样挣分票，每个人都想着多挣分票，更多赶出了活。
    妇女和儿童积极参加了麦收和锄苗。没有小孩的妇女到地里割麦子，有小孩的在家做饭、送饭，收割完了，男人种地锄苗，场里的活主要由妇女做。沈洪志的母亲五十多岁了，也参加割麦，第一天挣到七分，以后每天还与儿童一起，六天锄苗五十点六亩，有三个儿童每天能得十分，生产情绪很高，谁也不愿落后。缺点是儿童单独组织，和家长离开并不方便，也学不出活来，现正准备改编到农民互助组里。
    从这村互助中，发现了两个问题：一个是决定做活的先后，有些组采用抓阄办法，经领导发现指出多样不公平，应按地里活的缓急需要决定先后。有的组接受了这个意见，但有的组提出，如果锄的晚了，下一场雨，草长的猛，做活费了工怎么办？各组充分讨论了这个意见，确定还是按活决定先后，如果落了雨，多费的工由组内担起来，不叫主家出。
    另一个是有的组给军属代耕地，仍由代耕人单独做活，有的组连代耕地也都统一互助起来种，原代工人按工出分票。后一种办法比较好，领导上已注意到推广。
