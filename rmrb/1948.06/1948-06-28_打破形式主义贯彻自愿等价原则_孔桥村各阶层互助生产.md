Breaking Formalism and Implementing the Principle of Voluntary Equivalence
Kongqiao Village's Mutual Aid Production Among All Classes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Stepping into Kongqiao Village in the semi-old area of Xingtai, one immediately feels an atmosphere of intense labor. During the day, you can't see young men and women on the streets; they are all in the fields, helping each other with weeding. The slightly older ones are helping each other with threshing. Old women and children are also engaged in sideline production suitable for them, such as weaving mats and straw hats. Of the village's 381 households and 1,533 people, more than 90% of the households and population are participating in mutual aid groups.

Last Autumn, the Forced Organization of Mutual Aid Was Once Booming
But Most Collapsed Before the Autumn Harvest Was Completed

Last autumn, in response to the higher authorities' call to "not leave an acre of land uncultivated," Kongqiao "rushed" to form 40 mutual aid groups, but most of them collapsed soon after. At that time, they were organized in swathes. Xu Dongqing, Xu Dongzhang, and Nian Shizhang in the east of the village were not suitable at all, but they were also put in the same group. Xu Bangqing and Xu Dongsi bought a head of livestock together, but they were placed in two groups, and the livestock could not be used well. In order to solve the production difficulties of households without labor, all the village's 30 or so elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed people were equally distributed among the groups, without establishing a method of equivalent exchange. As a result, the labor burden of each group increased. Most mutual aid groups did not regularly settle wages or exchange work points, and some groups' accounts were simply a mess. Self-neglect, non-equivalence, and failure to settle wages in a timely manner caused the once "booming" mutual aid organizations to collapse before even completing the autumn harvest. As soon as the Outline Land Law was promulgated, Kongqiao, like some villages, did not truly understand the Party's policies. Some middle peasants were panicked, poor peasants were waiting for subsidies, and cadres were "waiting for Party rectification," causing production to fall into a state of laissez-faire and disorder. This situation further delayed the village's spring production, which should have been organized and planned.

Mobilizing Party Members and Cadres to Fully Lead Production
Rectifying Mutual Aid According to the Principle of Voluntariness and Equivalence

In early May, the Xingtai County Party Committee convened a county-wide cadre meeting, stopped the democratic Party rectification work in various places, mobilized cadres at all levels to fully lead production, and called for organization to carry out the summer harvest and summer planting. On June 2nd, Kongqiao held a village-wide production mobilization meeting, deeply publicizing the Party's policies towards all classes and emphasizing the idea that "labor is noble." It pointed out that after the land reform, as long as landlords and rich peasants engaged in production properly, everything they gained from their labor would be their own. It was decided to resolutely compensate middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against and to resolutely avoid touching middle peasants. Poor peasants who had been good at labor in the past should now engage in production even better and not just wait for subsidies to fill their holes. After clarifying the policies, the panicked were stabilized, and those waiting for subsidies also began to plan production. Then, a meeting of Party members and cadres was held to explain the purpose of democratic Party rectification: first, to enable everyone to correct their mistakes and better serve the masses, not to negate everything; second, to distinguish between right and wrong, seriousness and lightness, and to distinguish between acting for the public and acting for personal gain, clarifying who should be responsible for what and what the higher authorities should also be responsible for. Every Party member and cadre should transform themselves in active production, and each person should lead a mutual aid group well. In this way, Party members and cadres also began to become active. The next day, the whole village began to rectify mutual aid groups based on the principles of voluntariness, equivalence, and timely settlement of wages. For those who had not paid wages last year, it was stipulated that labor should be repaid with labor, and money should be paid if labor was not available. A small number of "sharp heads" were severely criticized by everyone, and it was explained that they would only be allowed to participate in the mutual aid group after they corrected their mistakes. Some mutual aid groups that had not recorded work points in the past could not be calculated at all. After summing up and reviewing, everyone proposed: "Suffer losses in the open," and "Merit will never be erased." Everyone made things clear, and it was all wiped clean. Then, the whole village freely organized mutual aid groups on a completely voluntary basis. Last year, all those who had exchanged equivalents and settled wages could forgive mutual aid this year, but most people reorganized. It was stipulated that whoever wanted to go to which group could go to which group, completely at will. Everyone's labor was divided into points, with fixed points used flexibly, and wages were settled every night. After harvesting wheat and weeding the first round of seedlings, wages were settled in full. With this completely fair and reasonable method, and under the pressure of the masses' urgent demands for wheat harvesting and weeding, the whole village organized 50 groups in one night and a production committee was formed by those who were wronged as middle peasant and landlord.

Implementing Precise Calculation to Organize Women's Production
Cao Qingduo's Group Became a Model for Mutual Aid in the Whole Village

Cao Qingduo's group became a model for promoting mutual aid production in the whole village. The group had eight households and 35 people, with seven male full laborers, three half laborers, nine female full laborers, and three half laborers. From the beginning, precise calculation was implemented. The group had 12.3 mu of wheat that had not been harvested, requiring 119 labor points; threshing required 132 points; distributing grain required 35 points; weeding 15.2 mu of grain seedlings required 38 points; weeding sorghum and beans required 203 points; and substitute cultivation required 212 points. They strived to complete it in ten days, requiring a total of 1,081 points. The calculation showed that they were still short 200 points. Zhou Qini, the wife of Cao Yongjin in this group, volunteered to go to the fields (women here did not go to the fields in the past), helping the men with 70 points in ten days. Under her influence, five other women also volunteered to go to the fields, increasing labor by 235 points. The group's plan was successfully completed. This practice of precise calculation and organizing women's production was immediately adopted by the whole village. On June 13th alone, 203 women participated in threshing and 66 women went to the fields to weed, harvest wheat, and production in the whole village entered a climax. On June 15th, the whole village victoriously completed the ten-day wheat harvesting, threshing, and weeding plan. Each group seized the opportunity to carry out mutual aid rectification and summary. The wheat harvest, which used to take 15 to 20 days to complete, was completed in ten days this time, saving a total of 323 workdays. Twenty model groups out of the 50 mutual aid groups were commended (including six mutual aid groups led by Communist Party members), and 15 groups that had not used work points were checked and criticized by everyone and corrected in a timely manner. In the summary, 43 production activists emerged in the whole village, including 12 women and some cadres. The relationship between Party members, cadres, and the masses gradually became closer in production. The 27 households who were still very skeptical about whether mutual aid production could be done well this year also requested to join mutual aid at this time. The number of mutual aid groups expanded from 50 to 53, and the remaining 31 households without labor were planned to be resolved through the combination of agricultural and sideline industries and equivalent exchange of labor. When people of all classes mentioned this year's mutual aid, they gave a thumbs up and said repeatedly, "Good! Good!" Landlord Nian Shunzhang told everyone he met: "I really want to help each other, to walk on the road of labor." Xu Jincheng, a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against, said: "I was sick for more than a month. If I didn't participate in the mutual aid group this time, my wheat would have rotted in the fields. Now all the difficulties have been solved." Middle peasant Xu Dongfeng especially felt the benefits of mutual aid. He suggested that mutual aid should be carried out for a long time. He said: "My family has eight people, but only one labor force. We cultivate 14 mu of land. If we don't help each other, where will I hire people for wheat harvesting and weeding?" Poor peasant Xu Qingxiang said: "I have six mu of land, but I don't have livestock and I lack agricultural tools. Mutual aid solves my difficulties. I am willing to unite and help each other and not collapse." Now, mutual aid in Kongqiao Village has become the center of mass unity and production in the whole village. They are planning to further improve agricultural technology, fertilization, and regular mutual aid in agricultural and sideline industries in the future. (Ze Ran)

### 打破形式主义贯彻自愿等价原则　孔桥村各阶层互助生产

　　打破形式主义贯彻自愿等价原则
  　孔桥村各阶层互助生产
    【本报讯】走进邢台半老区的孔桥村，立刻使人感到一种紧张劳动的气象。在白天，街上看不见青壮的男女，他们整日在地里互助锄苗。年纪稍大一些的，互相起来打场。老太婆和小孩，也在进行适合他们的编席、编草帽等副业生产。全村三百八十一户，一千五百三十三口人，百分之九十以上的户数和人口，都参加了互助组。
  　去秋强编互助一度轰轰烈烈
  　秋收还没完成大部就都垮台
    在去秋，孔桥响应上级“不荒一亩地”的号召，“突击”组成四十个互助组，不久大部分都垮台了。那时一片一片的编制起来，村东的徐东清、徐东章、粘士章根本不对劲，也编在一个组里。徐邦庆徐东四伙买了一头牲口，但却编在两个组里，牲口不能很好使用。为了解决没劳力户的生产困难，全村三十多个老弱孤寡，都平均分配到各个组里，没有制定等价交换的办法，结果增加了各组的劳动负担。大部互助组没有定期结算工资，交换工票，有些组的帐目，简直成了一锅浆糊。不自顾、不等价和不及时结算工资，使得一度“轰轰烈烈”的互助组织，连秋收也没有完成就垮台了。土地法大纲才一颁布，孔桥和某些村庄一样，各阶层没有真正了解了党的政策，有些中农恐慌，贫农等着抽补，干部“等着整党”，生产更陷于自流和紊乱。这种情况，又耽误了全村春季有组织有计划的生产。
  　动员党员干部全力领导生产
  　根据自愿等价原则整顿互助
    五月初，邢台县委召开全县干部会，停止了各地民主整党工作，动员各级干部，全力领导生产，号召组织起来，进行夏收夏耕。六月二日，孔桥召开全村生产动员大会，深入宣传党对各阶层的政策，强调了“劳动为贵”的思想。指出地主富农在土地改革后，只要好好生产，劳动得来的东西，全是自己的。坚决补偿错斗中农，坚决不动中农。贫农过去是好劳动，现在更应好好生产，不要光等抽补填窟窿。明确政策后，恐慌的安定了，等抽补的也计划开生产了。接着又召开了党员干部会，说明民主整党的目的：一、是为了使每个人修正错误更好为群众服务，不是否定一切，二、对错误要分清是非轻重，分清为公为私，那些自己应该负责，那些是上级也要负责。每个党员干部，应该在积极生产中改造自己，每个人要领导好一个互助组。这样党员干部也开始积极起来。第二天，全村根据自愿、等价、及时结算工资等原则，开始整顿互助组。去年有些没付工资的，规定有工还工，无工出钱。少数“尖头”受到大家严厉的批评，说明只有改正了才让他参加互助组。有些没有记工的互助组现在根本算不清了，经过总结检讨后，大家提出：“吃亏吃在明处”，“有功永不灭”，大家说明白，即一笔勾消了。然后全村在完全自愿的基础上自由碰伙互助起来。去年凡是等价交换，结算过工资的，今年都能原谅互助，但最大部分人，则是重新碰伙组织的。规定谁愿意到那个组就到那个组，完全自便。每个人的劳力都订成分，死分活用，每天晚上结算工资。收罢麦，锄罢第一遍苗，即全体总结算一次工资。规定了这种完全公平合理的办法，又在群众紧张的麦收锄苗要求下，全村在一个晚上，即组织起五十个组，错斗中农和地主富农也参加了，同时也出了生产委员会。
  　实行精确计算组织妇女生产
  　曹庆铎组成为全村互助模范
    曹庆铎小组成了推动全村互助生产的模范。该组共八户三十五口人，男全劳力七，半劳力三，女全劳力九，半劳力三。一开始就实行了精确计算。全组有十二点三亩麦未割，需用劳力一一九分，打场用一三二分，分谷三五分，锄谷苗一五点二亩用三十八分，锄高粱豆子用二○三分，代耕地二一二分，争取十天完成，共需一○八一分，计算结果，尚脱二百分。此组曹永金女人周起妮，就自动提出下地（这里过去女人是不下地的），十天要帮助男人七十分，在她的影响下，其他五个妇女也自动提出下地，共增加劳力二三五分。全组计划顺利完成。这种精确计算，组织妇女生产的作法立即被全村采用起来。仅六月十三号一天，即有二○三个妇女参加打场，六六个妇女下地锄苗，割麦，全村生产步入高潮。六月十五日，全村胜利的完成了十天的割麦打场锄苗计划。各组抓紧进行了互助整顿和总结，过去十五天到二十天才能完成的麦收，这次十天就完成了，共省工三百二十三个。五十个互助组中有二十个模范组受到表扬（其中有六个是共产党员领导的互助组），十五个没有使用工票的组被检查出来，受到大家批评，并及时得到改正。在总结中，全村涌现出四十三个生产积极分子，其中十二个人是妇女，一部分是干部。党员干部和群众的关系在生产中逐渐密切起来。开始还很怀疑今年生产互助能否作好的二十七户农民，此时也请求参加互助了。互助组由五十组扩大到五十三组，剩下无劳力的三十一户，计划从农副结合等价变工上去解决。各阶层一提到今年的互助，就伸出大姆指连声说：“好！好！”地主粘顺章见人就说：“我真愿意互助，朝着劳动这条大路上走。”错斗中农徐金成说：“我病了个多月，这次要不参加互助组，我的麦子只好烂在地里了。现在一切困难都解决了。”中农徐东峰特别感到互助的好处，他提议互助应长期搞下去，他说：“我一家八口，只一个劳动力，共种十四亩地，要是不互助起来，麦收锄苗时，我到那里去雇人呢？”贫农徐庆祥说：“我有六亩地，没有牲口，缺乏农具，互助起来，把我的困难解决了，我愿意团结互助，不要垮台。”现在孔桥村的互助，已成了全村群众团结生产的中心，他们正计划今后在农业技术上、施肥上，以及农副业的经常互助上，更提高一步。　　　　　　　（泽然）
