The Experience of Dingtao in Persisting in the Struggle in the Hinterland
Hai Yan, Jing Hua

On April 17th, Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Division arrived in the Dingtao area. For a month, they carried out cruel "sweeps" and "suppressions" in conjunction with local reactionary landlords, but our Party, government, army and people heroically and victoriously defended our positions, and this struggle is still continuing. The characteristics of the enemy's "sweeps" and "suppressions" this time are: First, the enemy's "sweeps" and "suppressions" are not short-term, but long-term, and their methods are unprecedentedly cruel and destructive. Second, the enemy's actions are intricate and complex. At the beginning, it was a seesaw situation, but soon it turned into "sweeps" and "suppressions." Sometimes, during the "sweeps" and "suppressions," enemy movements were also discovered passing through the area, a "small seesaw." If they discovered our units of one or two companies or more, they would immediately encircle and raid us. Therefore, "sweeps," "suppressions," "encirclements," and "raids" were intertwined. Third, the enemy's "sweeps" and "suppressions" are more planned and methodical, and more meticulous and thorough than in the past. Generally speaking, the enemy destroys our liberated areas in the following four steps: First, after the enemy enters our area, they first "eliminate" our open armed personnel to achieve open control and activity on the ground. In areas where the enemy is strong and we are weak, we turn to covert activities, or insert ourselves behind enemy lines to persist. Second, search for our public grain, materials, and weapons, and at the same time carry out large-scale looting of civilian grain. Generally, they start with above-ground resources and then go underground, finally arresting and beating the masses to force confessions, or using individual traitors to carry out looting. Third, destroy our underground constructions, such as ditches, tunnels, and secret caves. When the enemy "sweeps" and "suppresses" our hinterland, they investigate in advance, or force the masses to report, or use defectors to "contribute their services," in order to understand the situation of our tunnels and secret caves, and organize a large number of laborers to follow the army, concentrate their efforts to destroy the tunnels or dig out the exits, use fire to burn them, use cotton jackets to smoke them out, or infiltrate chili juice. At the same time, the enemy burns houses, kills people, and arrests people in villages and households where there are tunnels and secret caves, in an attempt to threaten and destroy the close relationship between us and the masses. Fourth, carry out bloody massacres. At the beginning, the enemy often spread various rumors to deceive and paralyze our masses and cadres and militia, tricking them into going home, but everyone did not fall for the enemy's tricks. Only a very small number were deceived, such as four militiamen from Hou Lou in Ran@ District who were killed after returning home. In areas such as Gua'anji and Dama Lou, all the young and middle-aged men were arrested.

Although the enemy has a force dozens of times larger than ours, and their plans and methods are so meticulous, vicious, and cunning, we have finally victoriously persisted in the hinterland struggle for a month. The reasons for the victorious struggle in the past month are not only the existence of favorable objective conditions, such as the presence of the masses, tunnels and secret caves, armed forces, and the enemy's shortcomings: soldiers' war-weariness and brutality, etc.; but also the use of the following subjective conditions: (1) We quickly discovered the enemy's intentions and characteristics, grasped the situation, and determined the direction. For example, we quickly knew that the enemy was not only resting and waiting to block our troops from crossing the river, but also understood that the enemy's main task was to combine with local reactionary landlords to "suppress" and "sweep" to destroy the manpower and material resources of our liberated areas, as well as the mass armed forces and people's organizations. Because of the rapid understanding of the situation, we made preliminary preparations in terms of ideology, mass work, and tunnel and armed work within a tight time frame, suffering less losses, persisting in the area, preserving ourselves, striking and killing the enemy, and protecting the interests of the masses. (2) Timely transformation of organizational forms and forms of struggle. At the beginning, the enemy was tracking our main force, and we relied on the masses and tunnels to persist in the struggle, while the large troops circled around and dodged the wind. When the enemy began small-scale sweeps and sought to occupy the area, we tightened our organizational structure, established a lean and capable armed force, inserted ourselves into the enemy's gaps, and combined with mass activities; while the large troops launched attacks on the outer lines to attract and strike the enemy. In persisting in the struggle in the hinterland, we relied on the masses, tunnels, secret caves, and various forms of armed forces to carry out a heroic and arduous struggle against the enemy. For example, in the enemy-occupied areas, we organized working teams to carry out covert activities at night, attack bad elements, carry out propaganda, and jointly study ways to deal with the enemy with the masses, understand the situation, and strengthen and improve the masses' confidence in victory. In guerrilla areas or areas on the edge of the hinterland, we established guerrilla groups to carry out semi-open activities, capture scattered enemy personnel, strike small groups of grain-grabbing enemies, carry out anti-enemy, anti-leveling, and anti-conscription to expand our area of activity, and protect the masses and work in the hinterland. In the hinterland, generally speaking, we can openly carry out activities, organize armed working teams to carry out work – propaganda, disaster relief, spring plowing, etc. In the past month, we captured a total of 37 enemy regular soldiers (excluding casualties), seized 7 American-style weapons, more than 200 bullets, and 2 horses. (3) Our persistence in the struggle in the hinterland is firm and tenacious, and it demonstrates the strength and combat effectiveness of our armed forces, as well as the noble qualities and integrity of our cadres. For example, on May 2nd, our county's working team of eight people fought with a platoon of the 600th Regiment of the 200th Brigade of the enemy in Sanjiao and Li Lou in Huangdian District for about 15 minutes, annihilating most of the enemy, capturing 7 enemy soldiers, wounding 3 enemy soldiers, seizing 5 American-style guns, 200 bullets, and 2 horses, and we suffered no casualties. On May 12th, a company of our large troops fought with a company of the 599th Regiment of the enemy's 200th Brigade on the outer line for about 20 minutes, repelling the enemy, killing and wounding 2 enemy soldiers, and the enemy left a corpse behind. On May 10th, our Tianji District guerrilla group of 10 people fought with a platoon of the enemy's main force in Wang Jiedui for more than 20 minutes, killing and wounding 3 enemy soldiers and seizing an American-style rifle. Our Yongshui District Chief Geng Shuangjin jumped into the enemy-occupied area and was surrounded by the enemy. Our District Chief Geng killed and wounded more than 10 enemy soldiers before committing suicide. On May 18th, our County Chief Liu Wanqin, Bureau Chief Song, and Comrade Zhang Tongan fought with the enemy in a tunnel, braving the enemy's bullets and fire, killing and wounding more than 10 enemy soldiers before successfully breaking through, etc. Due to our resolute and tenacious struggle, the enemy's "sweeps and suppressions" can only gain a large number of casualties.

In this persistence in the struggle in the hinterland, we also exposed some shortcomings. First of all, ideologically, there was insufficient understanding of the long-term and cruel nature of the enemy's "sweeps and suppressions" this time. Some comrades believed that the enemy would leave in a few days, so there was no long-term plan. Some comrades also believed that the enemy's Fifth Division was only resting or looking for the main force to fight, and would not "sweep" the local area, let alone "suppress" it. At most, they would only send out small groups to cooperate with local reactionary landlords to grab some grain, so they did not make specific preparations for the arrival of the most serious situation. Secondly, the enemy's "sweeps and suppressions" were initially from point to surface, from inside to outside, from above ground to underground, and "sweeping and suppressing" one area to isolate and paralyze another area. Some of our comrades could not specifically grasp this situation and abandoned many favorable opportunities to strike the enemy. Finally, some comrades believed that tunnels and secret caves were the only weapons of struggle, and everything was completely entrusted to tunnels and secret caves, without understanding that tunnels and secret caves have a certain role, but there are still many shortcomings, and we need to improve a step further before we can give full play to the high role of tunnels and secret caves. Other problems include defending one village and one place to the death, or retreating step by step, without making leap-style activities, or the enemy advancing and we advancing, inserting into the enemy's heart, and the mode of activity being rigid and simple.

In the future, to persist in the struggle in the hinterland of Henan, we should establish a larger armed force, unified organization, so that the enemy has some scruples and does not disperse its forces to expand the area of activity. The looting of grain and the arrest of manpower are serious. In the future, we must vigorously expose the enemy's conspiracies, educate, mobilize, and organize the masses to carry out anti-grain grabbing and anti-conscription struggles against the enemy, and carry out mass tunnel movements to implement a clear-field policy. In the future, we should adopt a variety of forms of struggle, improve the tunnels and secret caves a step further, and widely launch the "Three Earth Movement." Organize covert, semi-open, and open armed activities, and combine them with each other. The inner and outer line struggles must be closely combined. In tactics, adopt decentralized enemy-advancing-we-advancing, sparrow warfare, and stalemate tactics, etc. The organizational form should be transformed in a timely manner with the changing struggle situation and specific conditions. Strengthen the education and publicity of integrity, establish a firm and tenacious struggle direction, and commend the revolutionary heroism of the masses.

　　定陶坚持腹地斗争经验
    海燕　菁华
    四月十七日，蒋匪五师到我定陶地区。一个月来，结合土顽进行了残酷的“扫荡”、“清剿”，但我党政军民英勇胜利的坚持了阵地，目前这个斗争仍在继续发展中。这次敌人“扫荡”、“清剿”的特点：一、敌人的“扫荡”、“清剿”不是短时间的，而是长期性的，其手段是空前残酷的毁灭性的。二、敌人的行动是错综复杂的，开始时是拉锯形势，不久即转入“扫荡”、“清剿”；有时在“扫荡”、“清剿”中，也发现敌人的调动过境，“小拉锯”。如其发现我一两个连以上之部队时，即行合围奔袭，所以“扫荡”、“清剿”、“合击”、“奔袭”等互相错综着。三、在敌人“扫荡”、“清剿”中，是比较过去有计划有步骤的，而且比较精细深入。一般的说，敌人摧毁我解放区有下面四个步骤：第一、敌人进入我地区后，首先把我之公开武装人员“肃清”，达到他公开的在地面上控制和活动。这样在敌强我弱的地区，我们便转入隐蔽活动，或插进敌后的坚持。第二、搜索我方之公粮、资材、武器，同时实行大量的抢掠民粮。一般是先地上而后地下，最后抓打群众逼供告密，或利用个别叛逆分子进行抢掠。第三、破坏我地下的建设，如沟、地道、密洞等。敌人“扫荡”、“清剿”我腹地时，事先调查清楚，或逼打群众供报，或利用变节分子“献功”等，求得了解我地道密洞情况，并且随军组织大批民夫，集中力量，破坏地道或挖通出土口，用火烧烤，用棉套子薰烟，或渗辣椒汁。同时，哪村哪户有地道、密洞，敌人对哪个村户实行烧房子、杀人、抓人，企图威胁破坏我与群众之间的密切关系。第四、实行血腥的屠杀。敌人开始时，往往散布种种谣言，欺骗麻痹我群众和干部民兵，诓他们回家，但大家都不上敌人的当，只有极少数被欺骗的，如冉＠区候楼四个民兵回家，就被杀掉。姑庵集、大马楼等地，青壮年被抓一空。
    虽然敌人数十倍于我的优势兵力，计划和手段是如此的周密、毒辣、狡猾，但我们终于胜利的坚持了一个月的腹地斗争。一个月来胜利斗争的原因，不但客观上存在着有利的条件，如有群众，有地道、密洞，有武装及敌人的缺点：士兵厌战和残暴等；而且在主观上也运用了以下的条件：（一）我们很快的发现了敌人的企图、特点，掌握了形势，决定了方针。如我们很快的便知道这次敌人不但是休整等待阻击我过河部队，而且了解敌人主要的是结合地方土顽“清剿”、“扫荡”摧毁破坏我解放区的人力、物力及群众武装和人民组织。因为情况的了解迅速，使我在思想上、群众工作上及密洞、武装等工作上，在紧促的时间内均做了初步的准备工作，少受损失，而坚持了地区，保存了自己，打击和杀伤了敌人，保护了群众的利益。（二）及时的转变了组织形式和斗争形式。开始时，敌人是追踪我主力，而我们即依靠群众和地道坚持斗争，大队则跳圈子，躲风头。当敌人开始小股扫荡，并求得面的占领时，我们就紧缩了组织机构，建立精干的小武装，插入敌人间隙，结合群众活动；而大队则向外线出击，吸引和打击敌人。在坚持腹地斗争上，我们依靠了群众地道、密洞和各种形式的武装，向敌人进行了英勇艰苦的斗争。如在敌占领区，我们组织武工队，实行夜晚隐蔽的活动，打击坏蛋，进行宣传，与群众共同研究对敌办法，了解情况，加强与提高群众胜利信心。在游击区或腹地边沿区，则建立游击小组，进行半公开的捉敌人零星人员，打击小股抢粮敌人，进行反资敌、反平路、反抓丁扩大我活动面积，保护腹地群众和工作。在腹地内，一般地我可以公开活动，组织武装工作队进行工作——宣传、救灾、春耕等。一个月来，我共俘敌正规军三十七名（伤亡在外），缴美式武器七支，子弹二百余发，马两匹。（三）我们坚持腹地斗争，是坚定顽强的，而且表现了我们武装的强大，战斗力及干部高尚的品质和气节。譬如五月二日，我县武工队八人在黄店区三角、李楼与敌第二○○旅第六○○团一个排战斗约十五分钟，歼敌大部，俘敌七名，伤敌三名，缴美式枪五支，子弹二百发，马二匹，我无伤亡。五月十二日，我大队一个连在外线与敌二百旅五九九团一个连战斗约二十分钟，将敌打退，毙伤敌二名，敌遗尸一具。五月十日，我田集区游击小组十名在王揭堆与敌主力一个排战斗二十余分钟，毙伤敌三名，缴美式步枪一支。我永绥区长耿双进同志跳进敌占区时，被敌包围，我耿区长毙伤敌人十余名后自尽。五月十八日，我刘县长万钦、宋局长及张同安等同志，与敌进行地道战，冒着敌人的枪弹火烧等，毙伤敌人十余名后，胜利突围等等。由于我们坚决顽强的斗争，敌人的“扫荡清剿”，只能赚得大量的伤亡。
    我们在这次坚持腹地斗争，也暴露了一些缺点。首先，在思想上对于敌人此次“扫荡清剿”的长期性和残酷性认识不足，有些同志认为敌人住不几天就要走的，因此没有长期打算。也有些同志认为敌五师只是休整或找主力作战，不会“扫荡”地方的，更不会“清剿”，至多也不过抽出小股配合土顽抢些粮食，因此不作最严重局面到来时的具体准备工作。其次，本来此次敌人“扫荡清剿”，是先由点而后面，先由内而后外，先由地上而后地下，而且“扫荡清剿”这一地区，孤立麻痹那一地区，我们有些同志却不能具体掌握这个形势，放弃了许多有利时机打击敌人。最后，有些同志认为地道、密洞是斗争的唯一武器，一切完全寄托在地道密洞上，而不了解地道密洞是有一定的作用，还存在着不少缺点，我们还须要提高一步，然后才能发挥地道密洞的高度作用。其他如死守一村一地，或步步后退，而不作跳跃式的活动，或敌进我进插入敌人心脏，活动方式是呆板单纯的。
    今后，坚持河南腹地斗争，应建立较大的武装，统一组织，使敌有所顾虑，不致分散兵力，扩大面的活动。粮食的被抢，人力的被抓等是严重的，今后必须大力揭穿敌人阴谋，教育、发动、组织群众对敌进行反抢粮、反抓丁斗争，并开展群众性的地道运动，实行空室清野。今后应该采取多种多样的斗争形式，把地道密洞提高一步，广泛展开“三地运动”。组织隐蔽的、半公开的、公开的武装活动，并且互相结合起来。内线与外线斗争要密切结合起来。在战术上采取分散的敌进我进麻雀战和胶着战术等。组织形式应随着斗争形势及具体条件及时转变。加强气节教育与宣传，树立坚定顽强斗争的方向，表扬群众的革命英雄主义。
