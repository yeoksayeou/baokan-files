　　Cooperative Manager Actively Leads Production
  　Tucun Village Overcomes Spring Famine
    [Taihang News] Chen Shiyu, the manager of the Tucun Village Cooperative in Xiyang, organized the masses of the whole village to carry out various productions and overcome the spring famine. The village is a poor village with over seventy households and two hundred and sixty-one people. It suffered another poor harvest last year, and the whole village only harvested a little over a hundred *shi* of grain, so the disaster was very serious. The cooperative led by Chen Shiyu organized the masses to produce according to their demands since its establishment in September of the year before last. At that time, a total of more than 50,000 yuan was raised in shares, with 51 members. Because the masses had difficulty getting cloth, the cooperative organized and opened a textile training class to develop textile production and solve the problem of clothing. From last year to February of this year, after three hundred-day textile campaigns, the whole village achieved self-sufficiency in cloth and increased the number of looms by 16 and spinning wheels by 60. The cooperative helped to purchase cotton on behalf of the members and promote the sale of products. It has now purchased more than 60 *jin* of cotton and is preparing to lend it to the masses who have no money to buy cotton for textile production. In addition, the cooperative also organized the masses to boil saltpeter. Starting in July last year, only four people participated, but after half a month it developed to fourteen people, using 1,300 workdays to boil 1,200 *jin* of saltpeter, netting 8,000 *jin* of millet. Currently, there are still 200 *jin* of saltpeter in stock. Last winter, the whole village paid 11,000 *jin* of public grain, all earned from boiling saltpeter. As a result, 32 villages in the eighth district and more than ten villages in the sixth district began to boil saltpeter. In addition, the cooperative also organized an oil mill and a store, earning a total of 69 *shi* of millet. By the third dividend distribution this year in the first month, a total of more than 300,000 yuan was earned. The share capital was also expanded to 2,676 and a half shares (100 yuan per share), and the number of members expanded to 252, accounting for more than 96 percent of the village's population. This spring, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses in terms of living and fertilizer when sowing, the cooperative also lent 200 *jin* of millet and brought back sheep from Shouyang for the masses to use as fertilizer. Last fall, it also helped the masses buy back five bulls and eight cows, solving the difficulty of draft animal power for spring plowing. Due to the manager's active efforts, he sought benefits for everyone and gradually turned the situation around. The masses of the whole village rewarded him with 300 *jin* of millet. But he refused and bought a large cart instead, placing it in the cooperative for the masses to use.

　　合作社经理积极领导生产
  　土岔村渡过春荒
    【太行消息】昔阳土岔村合作社经理陈世鱼，组织全村群众进行各种生产，渡过春荒。该村是个七十来户、二百六十一口人的穷村。去年又歉收，全村只收下百多石粮食，所以灾荒很严重。陈世鱼领导的合作社，从前年九月成立起，就依照群众要求组织群众生产。当时共集股五万余元，社员五十一人。因为群众穿布困难，合作社便组织开办纺织训练班，发展纺织，解决穿衣问题。去年到今年二月，经过三个百日纺织运动，全村做到穿布自给，并增加织布机十六架，纺车六十辆。合作社帮助代买棉花，推销葳品，现在已买下六十多斤花，准备借给没钱买花的群众进行纺织。此外，还组织群众熬硝。去年七月开始，只有四人参加，半个月后发展到十四人，用一千三百个工，熬硝一千二百斤，净赚小米八千斤，现还存硝二百斤。去冬全村公粮一万一千斤，全部是熬硝赚来的。于是影响八区卅二个村和六区十多个村都熬起硝来了。另外合作社又组织一个油坊，一个店房，共赚小米六十九石。到今年正月第三次分红，共赚洋卅多万。又扩大股金到二千六百七十六股半（每股一百元），社员扩大到二百五十二人，占全村人口百分之九十六以上。今春为解决群众下种时生活和肥料等困难，又借出小米二百斤，到寿阳搞来羊给群众卧地。去秋还帮助群众买回五头公牛、八头母牛，解决了春耕畜力困难。由于经理的积极努力，给大家谋了利益，逐渐翻起身来，全村群众奖励他三百斤小米。但他不要，又买成一辆大车，放在社里让群众使用。
