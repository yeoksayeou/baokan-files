Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS Rome dispatch: Italian Communist leader Togliatti, in a speech during the parliamentary debate on the government's program on the evening of the 11th, stated that Gasperi's proposed program is an "empty document" that carefully avoids the specific problems of the current historical stage and does not align with the mission of the first National Assembly, which is to implement the Constitution and its stipulated social reforms. Gasperi is attempting to shelve reforms, but unemployment is currently at the highest record in Italian history. According to the General Confederation of Labor's data from April of this year, the number of unemployed has reached 2.29 million, and 28% of industrial workers are without work. The 400 billion lira that the Marshall Plan allows for Italy is only enough to cover half of the national budget deficit of 750 billion lira. Industry is in a state of "chronic decline," and due to the restrictions of the Marshall Plan, Italy is being artificially separated from Eastern European countries, which are intensely industrializing, and Italian industry could be one of their most important sources of machinery. Regarding land reform, the government has done nothing but use political tactics to deal with the working people who are demanding land distribution. Togliatti demanded that the government clearly answer its position on peace and war and whether it intends to obey its American masters, thereby dragging Italy into anti-Soviet military blocs. Togliatti concluded: The task of the opposition, in addition to criticizing and exposing the government's actions and policies, is to continue expanding the people's movement to implement the various reforms stipulated by the Constitution, which can no longer be delayed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS Rome dispatch: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni, in a speech in Congress on the 11th, stated that the Socialist Party will strive by all means to prevent Italy from joining the Western bloc, whether it is a copy of Brussels (referring to the military alliance treaty signed by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in Brussels), or in the form of a Mediterranean bloc with Turkey and Greece participating. Nenni continued: The government's foreign policy, in summary, is anti-Soviet and anti-revolutionary. We do not want anything similar to this policy. We believe that world peace is indivisible, and different social systems can coexist. We have every reason to say that we can coexist peacefully and cooperate with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. Regarding the elections of April 18th, Nenni pointed out that the Catholic Church acted as the Christian Democratic Party's "election campaign machine" in this election, violating Italian national law. As a result of American interference in the election campaign, Italy has been placed in the position of a subordinate country.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS Rome dispatch: Italian Socialist Party Secretary-General Basso, after returning from the Warsaw Left-Wing Socialist Party conference, told a "Forward News" reporter on the 11th that he was very satisfied with the work of the conference. He said that all the representatives unanimously understood the particular importance of the tasks facing the Left-Wing Socialist Parties, especially the Left-Wing Socialist Parties in Western Europe. Basso said, "I saw intense activity in Poland and Czechoslovakia, which is in sharp contrast to the situation in Italy and France. This indicates that the people there enthusiastically support the government's new system. They are overcoming enormous difficulties and bravely establishing a new social order full of justice and the joy of life."

　　意共社两党领袖
  　抨击政府纲领
    托格里亚蒂指出：反对派的任务在继续扩大人民阵线。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意共领袖托格里亚蒂于十一日晚在议会辩论政府纲领时演说称：加斯贝利提出的纲领是一个“空洞的文件”它小心地避开了历史现阶段的具体问题，并且不符合第一届国会的任务，这一任务就是实行宪法及其所规定的社会改革。加斯贝利企图使改革搁置起来，但在目前失业已达意国历史上的最高纪录。据总工会今年四月的材料，失业者已达二百二十九万人，产业工人中有百分之二十八没有工作。照马歇尔计划所允许给予意大利的四千亿里拉总共只够国家预算赤字七千五百亿里拉的一半。工业正处于“慢性衰颓”中，而由于马歇尔计划的限制，意大利正被人工地与东欧国家隔离开来，这些东欧国家正紧张地进行工业化，意国工业本可以成为它们机器的最重要来源之一。说到土地改革，政府除了用政治手腕对付要求分配土地的劳动人民之外，毫无作为。托氏要求政府明确答复它对和平与战争所持之立场及其是否打算听命美国主子，从而将意大利卷入反苏的军事集团之中。托氏结语称：反对派的任务除批评和揭露政府的行动及政策外，还在于继续扩大人民运动，以实施宪法所规定的各项改革，这已不能再事拖延了。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意社会党领袖南尼于十一日在国会演说称，社会党将以一切方法力求阻止意大利参加西方集团，不论它是布鲁塞尔的版样（按指英法荷比卢在布鲁塞尔签订的军事同盟条约），或者是有土耳其希腊参加的地中海集团的形式。南尼继称：政府的外交政策总括起来说就是反苏和反革命。我们不要与这种政策相同的任何东西。我们认为全世界的和平不可分割，不同的社会制度可以共存。我们有一切的根据说，我们能与苏联及其他东欧国家和平共居与合作。论及四月十八日的选举时，南尼指出：天主教教会在此次大选中充当了基督教民主党的“竞选机关”，侵犯了意大利国家的法律。由于美国干涉选举运动的结果，意大利已被置于附属国的地位。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意社会党总书记巴苏，自参加华沙左冀社会党会议归来后十一日告“前进报”记者称：他很满意会议的工作，他说，所有代表都一致了解面临左冀社会党的特别是西欧左冀社会党的任务的特别重要性。巴苏说，“我在波兰和捷克看到紧张的活动与意、法两国的情形，适成尖锐对照，这表示该地人民热情地支持政府的新制度，他们克服着巨大的困难，勇敢地建立充满正义和生命的快乐的新社会秩序”。
