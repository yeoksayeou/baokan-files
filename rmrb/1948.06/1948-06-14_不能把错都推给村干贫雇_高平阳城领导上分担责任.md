【Taiyue News】In Gaoping, some district cadres, during the process of correcting left-leaning errors, are pushing all the blame onto village cadres, causing discontent and fear among them. A village cadre from Sanlan Village in the Second District said: "During the big blockade last year, it was Zhang Laicai (a district cadre) who led the effort and insisted on blocking the gate overnight. Now, all the responsibility is being pushed onto us. How can we continue to work?" Now, during the error correction, some district cadres are bypassing the village cadres and correcting the errors themselves, while also providing haphazard interpretations of democracy, saying: "Now it's democracy, village cadres can't be forced to do anything. If they don't want to attend meetings, they don't have to; if they don't want to treat military families well, they don't have to." Therefore, village cadres in the Fifth District generally say: "Relying on the mountain (referring to superiors) is unreliable, relying on the water (referring to the masses) is like water flowing away." This leaves village cadres unsure of what is right. To correct these issues, each district convened meetings of village cadres around the 20th of last month. District cadres reviewed their past incorrect attitudes towards village cadres. For example, District Chief Xu of the Fourth District said: "In the past, the district did not invite cadres with middle peasant backgrounds to meetings, and praised actions that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. The leadership must take responsibility for the past errors. However, village cadres who acted without the district's approval should take responsibility themselves." Wang Luosun, the instructor of Aoshan in the Second District, acted recklessly in the village and secretly divided the land, and everyone believed that he should be held personally responsible. After two or three days of discussion, the village cadres saw that the district cadres were admitting their mistakes, and their thinking gradually changed, and they began to examine their own errors. The village chief of Dongzhai Village said, "As long as we correct our mistakes, we have a future. We can't give up halfway!"
    【Taiyue News】In Xigou Village, Yangcheng, in this error correction, because all the blame was pushed onto poor and hired peasants, it caused dissatisfaction among the poor and hired peasants, who demanded accountability. Based on the demands of the masses and the poor and hired peasants, the work team convened a meeting of poor peasant group leaders and above the level of Li-chiefs (闾长, neighborhood heads), allowing everyone to discuss the matter. As a result, things were clarified. For example, Guo Qun, the accountant of the cooperative, said: "The main responsibility lies with the instructor who came up with the idea, Guo Tianxing who came forward to do it, and Zhang Gengyuan who pushed it hard from behind to settle personal grudges." Initially, the cadres could not accept this, but with the explanation and help of the work team, the cadres all made self-criticisms. On the 13th of last month, the masses were asked to discuss at the winter school whether there were any expansions or contractions. Everyone argued back and forth, and finally they all agreed: "That's exactly how it was!" Then, after everyone discussed and formulated a method for compensating the middle peasants, a mass meeting was convened on the 19th to announce that the middle peasants had been harmed and must be compensated. The village cadres then apologized to the masses. Finally, the village chief Guo Tianqing formally announced the error correction method, which was discussed and approved by the masses.

　　不能把错都推给村干贫雇
  　高平阳城领导上分担责任
    【太岳消息】高平有些区干部在纠正左倾工作中，把一切错误往村干部身上推，引起村干部不满和害怕。二区伞蓝村村干说：“去年大封门时，是张来才（区干部）领导非叫一夜把门封起不行，现在把责任完全推到我们身上，这还能干吗？”现在纠偏时，有些区干部又踢开村干部，自己去纠偏，还胡乱解释民主说：现在民主啦，村干部啥事也不能强迫，不想参加会就不去参加；不想优待军属，就不优待。所以五区村干部普遍都说：“靠山（指上级）靠不住，靠水（指群众）水流了。”弄得村干部不知怎样才对。为了改正这些毛病，各区都在上月二十日前后召集村干部会，区干检讨了过去对村干部的不正确态度，如四区许区长说：“过去区上开会不叫中农成份的干部参加，表扬了侵犯中农的事实，过去的错误，领导上也要负责。但村干部不通过区上，自己瞎干的，自己要负责。”二区鏖山指导员王洛孙，在村胡作非为，又偷偷平分土地，大家都认为他个人要负责。这样经过两三天讨论，村干部看到区干部还承认错误哩，大家的思想就慢慢转变检讨开自己的错了。董寨村长说：“咱们只要改正错就有前途，不能干到半路不干了！”
    【太岳消息】阳城西沟村在这次纠偏中，因为把什么错都往贫雇头上推，所以使贫雇不满意，要求追责任。工作组根据群众和贫雇的要求，召开了贫雇组长和闾长以上的干部会议，让大家讨论，结果把事情弄清了，如合作社会计郭群说：“主要责任是指导员出的计，郭天兴出头露面干的，张庚元为了报私仇，在后面推的也紧。”一开始干部接受不下，但在工作组解释帮助下。干部都作了检讨。上月十三号在冬学上叫群众公议看是不是有扩大的和缩小的，大家吵来吵去，最后都认为：“就是这样！”接着大家商议订出赔偿中农的办法后，在十九日就召开群众大会，宣布伤害了中农，一定要补偿，村干部就向群众认不是。最后由村长郭天庆把纠偏办法正式宣布，经过群众圪，通过了。
