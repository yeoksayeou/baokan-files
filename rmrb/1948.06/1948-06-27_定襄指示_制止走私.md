Dingxiang Instruction
　　Stop Smuggling
[North Yue News] The Yan bandit is struggling desperately. Since March, he has continuously dumped American goods into our Dingxiang Liberated Area in exchange for grain. In the beginning, the leadership did not pay attention to prevention, and some profiteers and the masses illegally trafficked, and some militiamen and cadres also engaged in smuggling, forming a serious smuggling phenomenon for a time. At the production meeting in March, the Dingxiang County Party Committee strictly pointed out the serious harm of private goods dumping to our liberated area, reviewed the bureaucracy of the leadership, and made up its mind to resolutely stop it. Individual county and district cadres who engaged in smuggling overcame it; however, many village cadres, militiamen, and veterans continued to smuggle, and some merchants used transfer funds to smuggle. In April and May, the remaining smuggled goods alone included 43.5 bolts of various foreign cloth and city cloth, 165 cartons of cigarettes, 45 bolts of various striped cloth, 38 lengths of hemp goods, 29 boxes of matches, 201 pieces of second-hand clothing, 58 barrels of various indigo, and a part of other luxury and superstitious goods. If the leaked smuggled goods are added, the number should be even more alarming. The smuggling phenomenon has seriously affected the county's handicrafts and household sideline industries: for example, in the past, most of the families in the second and sixth districts weaved cloth, but this year the number has decreased a lot. Hongdao City had 68 looms last year, but this year it has been reduced to more than 20. Last year there were 28 knitting machines, but this year only about 10 are left. The finished products still cannot be sold. In order to completely eliminate the smuggling phenomenon, the County Party Committee held another production expansion cadre meeting on August 3, pointing out that the current focus of the struggle against the enemy is to arm and protect the wheat harvest and comprehensively implement the anti-smuggling work. It pointed out that if we do not pay attention to the management of import and export trade and anti-smuggling work with strong leadership, our industry and commerce and household sideline industries will not be able to develop. At the meeting, the criminal behavior of a few cadres who violated policies and destroyed discipline was severely criticized. Xing Denggui, who was seriously involved in smuggling and did not reflect well, was given the punishment of dismissal, and everyone was educated. On June 11, the County Party Committee issued instructions on the current struggle against the enemy, once again educating cadres to recognize that smuggling is helping the enemy, and that they should actively carry out mass propaganda and education work; to make the masses realize the harm of smuggling to themselves and completely stop the smuggling phenomenon. Cadres should actively lead and help the masses organize sideline production, and the cooperative should be responsible for connecting with shops and buying native cloth, so that the production of native cloth in the second and sixth districts can be improved. Party members, militiamen, and village representatives should lead the masses to carry out mass anti-smuggling campaigns, which should be handled by special cadres, and armed anti-smuggling should be organized when necessary. Cadres who smuggle should be punished more severely.

　　定襄指示
  　制止走私
    【北岳讯】阎匪垂死挣扎，自三月以来，不断向我定襄解放区倾销美货，套换粮食。开始时领导上没有注意防止，一些奸商与群众即非法贩运，某些民兵、干部也进行走私，一时形成严重的走私现象。定襄县委在三月份的生产会议上，曾经严格指出私货倾销对我解放区的严重危害，检讨了领导上的官僚主义，下定决心坚决制止，个别进行走私的县、区干部克服了；但不少村干、民兵、荣军仍继续走私，一些商人则利用拨兑款项走私。四、五月份仅剩下的私货即有各色洋布市布四十三匹半，纸烟一百六十五条，各色条布四十五匹，麻货三十八丈，火柴二十九箱，估衣二百零一件，各色靛五十八桶，及其他奢侈品、迷信品一部。如加上脱漏走私品在内，数字当更惊人。走私现象已严重影响该县手工业及家庭副业：如二、六区过去大多数几家织布，今年则减少了很多。宏道市去年有织布机六十八架，今年已减到二十多架。去年廿八架织袜机，今年只剩了十来架。所出成品还卖不出去。县委为了彻底消灭走私现象，特于八月三日再开了生产扩干会，指出目前对敌斗争的重点，是武装保卫麦收和全面贯彻开展缉私工作。指出如不注意出入口贸易管理及有坚强领导的缉私工作，我们的工商业及家庭副业就无法开展。在会上严厉批评了少数干部违反政策、破坏纪律的犯罪行为，对严重走私且不很好反省的邢灯贵给予撤职处分，教育了大家。六月十一日县委发出目前对敌斗争的指示，再次教育干部认识走私就是帮助敌人，应积极展开群众性的宣传教育工作；使群众认识到走私对自己的危害，彻底制止走私现象。干部应积极领导与帮助群众组织副业生产，推进社应负责和商店连系，股买土布，使二、六区的土布生产提高一步。党员、民兵、村代表应带领群众开展群众性的缉私运动，由专门干部负责，必要时组织武装缉私。干部走私者要加倍处罚。
