Retrieving Corpses
    Wei Jin
    Twenty or thirty meters south of Tiezuo Temple in Linfen City, there is a depression with a large well. The cruel and barbaric Yan Faction special police team (special service organization) used this well as a slaughterhouse for killing innocent people of Linfen.

    On May 29th, when the reporter and a group of people retrieving corpses walked towards this slaughterhouse, the stench of corpses wafted from afar. Approaching the wellhead, the vast depression was densely covered with lush weeds. In the gaps between the clumps of dense grass were piles of bloodstains from the killings, mixed with the soil and turned into light red and dark gray earth. We stepped on the bloodstains and walked to the wellhead, and the gloomy well was simply terrifying! There was no water to be seen, only piles of naked corpses. According to people familiar with this well: the well is more than ten fathoms deep, and from the water surface to the bottom of the well is more than two fathoms deep, and the water surface is more than one fathom wide. These corpses filled from the bottom of the well, exceeding the water surface like a small mountain. How many bodies are there here? Someone went to the Public Security Bureau and asked the murdering demon Mao Shixun (the Yan Faction special police team leader was captured by us early on), but he also said he didn't know. The corpse retrievers endured the stench and retrieved the first layer of corpses (using a rope to tie the iron hook and pull it up), but still couldn't see the water. They retrieved the second layer of corpses, but still couldn't see the water. They retrieved the third layer of corpses... until they had retrieved thirty or forty corpses, they finally saw the well water, which was blackish-red water floating with layers of human oil! The corpse retrievers then retrieved thirty more corpses from the water. Gradually, it became difficult to retrieve them. Sometimes they could only retrieve an arm, a leg, a piece of intestine, or a head, or a skeleton...

    Among the more than sixty corpses retrieved, each corpse still had its hands twisted and tied tightly with ropes. At the same time, on each of the corpses swollen by the water, there were countless bayonet holes. When the Yan Faction special agents kidnapped these innocent people at night on trumped-up charges, stuffed their mouths with cotton, and dragged them to this terrible slaughterhouse to kill them, they did not expect that this inhuman method could not suppress the anger of the people of Linfen. The people of Linfen all knew how these people died. They recorded the unpayable blood debt with Yan Xishan. They hoped that the People's Liberation Army would capture Taiyuan as soon as possible and quickly avenge the dead!

    The crowd of people collecting the corpses, with extremely grief-stricken hearts, searched for their relatives among the corpses, but where could they be found? They had no choice but to recognize their clothes, but the clothes had long been torn during the execution, or had been taken off by the bandits to make a fortune (referring to good clothes). How could they be recognized? Some people patiently searched the dead for special marks (such as a lump or a scab on the body before death), but the scars on the corpses were already countless. How could they be found?

    People are dead, and their bodies cannot be found. "What crimes did these people commit?" Many family members tearfully accused.

    The reporter asked several family members, and several of them were unjustly killed in this way: A student from Linfen Normal School, one night, pointed his finger at the portrait of Yan Xishan on the wall several times in his room, and was unfortunately seen by a special police team member outside the window (the special police team member was sent to the school to monitor student activities). He was immediately arrested and then thrown into the well. Zhang Xieheng, the father of Zhang Yaoting, a cadre of the democratic government, was arrested by the special police team for saying a word to the plainclothes team in Xiaocheng Village, and never returned. He Wanyi's older brother from Xiwang Village was accused of being a "pretender" for saying a few words to the rotating combat team. Kang Shichang from Zhang Zuan Village was doing business in the city and once wrote a letter to his family, and was accused of communicating with the Eighth Route Army... Ah! These were their trumped-up crimes. So they were arrested into the special police team, and no one ever wanted to see them again. If you wanted to see them, you could only find them among the corpses retrieved from the well today.

　　捞尸
    维进
    临汾市铁作寺南二三十公尺的地方，有一块洼地，洼地里有一口大水井。残酷野蛮的阎匪特警队（特务机关），就把这口井当作杀戮临汾无辜人民的屠场。
    五月二十九日，记者和一群捞尸的群众走向这座屠场时，老远就飘来了死尸的恶臭。将及井口，广阔的洼地已被茂盛的野草所密盖，一团一团密草的间隙里，一堆一堆杀人的血迹，和土壤混合起来已变成淡红色的，深灰色的泥土了。我们踏着血迹走到井口，看见那阴沉沉的大井，简直使人可怕极了！这里看不见水，只看见堆积如山的赤身露体的死尸。据熟悉此井的人说：井有十余丈深，从水面到井底，有两丈余深，水面有一丈余宽，那么这些死尸从井底填的超过水面如同一座小山，这里到底有多少尸体呢？有人曾去公安局，问过杀人魔王毛世勋（阎匪特警组长早被我捕获），但他也说弄不清楚了。捞尸人忍着恶臭，把第一层死尸捞起来后（用绳子拴住铁钩往上拘的），还看不见水，又捞起第二层死尸，还不见水，又捞起第三层死尸………一直把死尸捞了三四十具，才看见井水，这是黑红色的漂浮着一层一层人油的水呀！捞尸人又从水中捞出三十多具死尸后，渐渐不好捞了，有时只能捞出一只臂膊，一条腿，一块肠肚，或者一颗人头，或一付骨架………。
    在捞出来的六十余具死尸当中，每一具死尸都还是＠着手，被绳子捆得紧紧的；同时在每一具被水漂得肿胀的尸体上，都有数不清的刺刀的窟窿。当阎匪特务们用莫须有的罪名夜间绑走这些无辜的群众，用棉花堵住他们的嘴巴，拉到这一可怕屠场杀害时，他们没有想到这种惨无人道的手段，并不能镇压临汾人民的愤怒，临汾人民谁都知道这些人是怎样死去的，他们记下了和阎锡山不可解的血债，他们希望解放军早日打下太原，迅速给死者报仇！
    收尸的人群带着非常悲愤的心情，在尸群中找觅自己的亲属，但是那里还能找见呢？他们只好认起衣裳来，但是衣裳早已在行刑被打破了，或者是被匪徒们扒掉发洋财去了（指好的衣裳），又那里能认出来呢？有的人耐心在死者身上找觅特别记号（如生前身上有一个圪塔，或一个疥巴等），但是尸体上面的伤痕已经数不清了，那里还能找得出来呢？
    人死了，尸首找不见了，“到底这些人犯了什么罪呢”？许多家属痛哭的控诉着。
    记者询问了几位家属，其中有几人是这样冤死的：临汾师范的一位学生，某天晚上，在房里用指头对着壁上的阎锡山像点了几下，不幸被窗外一个特警组员看见了（特警组员就是派来学校监视学生活动的），立刻就被逮捕起来，以后就被投到井里了。民主政府干部张耀庭的父亲张协恒，在小程村给便衣队说过一句话也被特警队抓走，以后就没有回来。西王村何万义的亲哥，和轮战队说过几句话，就以“伪装”分子论罪。张纂村亢世昌，在城里做买卖，有一次给家里写了一封信，就以通八路论罪了……啊！这就是他们莫须有的罪过，于是他们被抓进特警队里，谁也不要再想见面了，如果想见面的话，那只有从今天井中捞出的尸首里头去找了。
