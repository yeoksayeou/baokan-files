[Ji Zhong News] An'guo's pharmaceutical industry is famous throughout the country, known as "Yao Zhou" (Medicine Prefecture), and once had thirteen gangs. During the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China (1926-1927), there were more than 1,400 households engaged in the pharmaceutical business, more than 800 pharmaceutical brokers, and more than 1,000 workers carrying medicine packages. More than 40 silver firms were established due to the developed pharmaceutical industry. During the spring and winter temple fairs, merchants from all over the country gathered; merchants from Central China, Guangdong and Guangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou, Taiwan, Northeast China, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Gansu, and other places brought large quantities of goods to sell here; at most, there were more than 3,000 pharmaceutical merchants, 2,000 to 3,000 brokers, and 3,000 to 4,000 workers carrying medicine packages. In the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), the Kuomintang government established a "Pharmaceutical Brokerage Bureau" in this place to rule and extort pharmaceutical merchants, and the pharmaceutical industry gradually declined. Pharmaceutical merchants held strikes and market shutdowns in March of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930) to protest. After the July 7th Incident (1937), the Japanese invaders occupied the city and extorted and squeezed everything, and the pharmaceutical industry plummeted, leaving only 21 households to maintain appearances. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the People's Liberation Army recovered the city, and the democratic government issued orders to develop industry and commerce and protect merchants from all over the world who came here to do business. Merchants in the city resumed their businesses one after another. Yongrui Zhuang, Tongxiangdong, Yifaxiang and other pharmaceutical merchants who had moved to Tianjin also moved back. Pharmaceutical merchants from all over the country also resumed selling goods in An'guo. In the 35th and 36th years of the Republic of China (1946-1947), the democratic government vigorously supported Fuxinggong, Farmer and other silver firms to handle foreign exchange, deposits and loans. Last year alone, these silver firms received a total of 59.2 billion in deposits (border currency, same below) and issued loans of 78.2 billion. The bank also provided industrial and commercial long-term loans of 12 million and short-term loans of 35.6555 million. A foreign exchange exchange was also established to facilitate foreign pharmaceutical merchants to do business here. An'guo's pharmaceutical industry is gradually recovering, and merchants from Beiyue, Ji'nan, Bohai, Shanxi, Tianjin and other places have come to do business. During the land reform last year, some industries and businesses were infringed upon, and some "leftist" errors were committed in the labor movement, causing some merchants to doubt our party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce. In order to correct the policy and thoroughly correct these errors, the democratic government convened a forum for urban merchants and poor peasant representatives in February this year to explain our party's policy of developing and protecting industry and commerce and the New China News Agency's "February 7th" editorial. Afterwards, the wrongly seized commercial properties were returned, and the import and export taxes and transaction taxes on pharmaceuticals were abolished, and the merchants' emotions immediately stabilized. As of June 10, the number of raw medicine firms had increased from 21 during the enemy occupation to 304, an increase of 24 compared to before the land reform. The "Qizhi" pharmaceutical factory can trade 10 million to 15 million yuan every day. The number of transit transportation companies has increased from two during the enemy occupation to nine, and the number of warehouses has increased from eight to thirty-one. There are often 200 large trucks transporting medicinal materials back and forth. In addition to the unobstructed access to various parts of the North China Liberated Area, sales channels in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong and other places have also been opened. In the three months of March, April and May this year, more than 1.36 million catties of medicinal materials were exported, worth 6.602 billion yuan. Finally, "Qizhi", "Zhonghua" and other five pharmaceutical companies successively opened, and have produced medicines such as "Shi Di Nian" (a medicine name) and other Chinese and Western medicines, which are sold in Beiyue, Ji'nan, Shandong and other places.

　　安国药业逐渐繁荣
    【冀中讯】安国药业驰名全国，号称“药州”，曾有十三帮之称。民国十五、六年间，经营药业的达一千四百多户，有药业经纪八百余人，背打药包的工人一千余名。因药业发达而设的银号有四十余户。在春冬庙会期间，各地客商云集；华中、两广、云桂、台湾、东北、新疆、陕甘等地商人，均携带大批货物来此销售；最多时药商达三千多户，经纪二、三千人，背打药包的工人三·四千个。民国十六年，国民党政府在此地设立一“药业牙纪局”，对药商进行统治勒索，药开始逐渐萧条。药商曾在民国十九年三月间举行罢工罢市以示抗议。七七事变后，日寇侵占该城，勒索压榨百出，药业一蹶不振，仅剩二十一户支应门面。三十四年八月人民解放军收复该城，民主政府明令发展工商业，保护各地商人来此经商，该城商户纷纷复业。迁往天津的永瑞庄、同向东、义发祥等药商陆续搬回。各处药商也恢复来安国销货物。三十五、六年，民主政府大力扶植复盛公、农民等银号，办理外汇和存放款等业务，去年一年，这些银号共收存款五九二亿（边币·下同），放款七八二亿。银行也举办工商业长期贷款一千二百万，短期贷款三千五百六十五万五千元。并建立了外汇交易所，以便利外区药商来此经营，安国药业日趋恢复，北岳、冀南、渤海、山西、天津等地商人纷纷赶来经商。去年土地改革中侵犯了一些工商业，工运中又犯了些左倾错误，致使某些商人对我党保护与发展工商业的政策发生怀疑。为了端正政策，彻底纠正这些错误，民主政府在今年二月间召开了城关商人、贫农代表座谈会，讲解我党发展与保护工商业的政策和新华社“二七”社论，接着退还了错斗商业的财产，又明令取消了药业出入口税及交易税，商人情绪顿趋稳定。截至六月十日统计，生药行已由敌占时期的二十一户增到三百零四户，比土改前增二十四户。“旗帜”药厂每天可交易一千万至一千五百万元。转运行已由敌占时期的两户增到九户，货栈已由八户增至三十一户。经常有大车二百辆来往运输药材，除了华北解放区各地已贯通无阻外，天津、上海、香港等地的销路也已打开。今年三、四、五三个月内，药材出口一百三十六万余斤，价值六十六亿零二百余万元。最后“旗帜”、“中华”等五家制药相继开张，已出品士的年（药名）等中西药品，行销北岳、冀南、山东等地。
