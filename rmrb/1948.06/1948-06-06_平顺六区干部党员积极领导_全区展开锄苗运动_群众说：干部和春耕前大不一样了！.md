[Pingshun News] After attending the county-wide cadre expansion meeting, cadres in various villages in Pingshun's Sixth District and Party members resolved their ideological confusion and are actively leading production, showing initial signs of a new atmosphere. According to work reports from the past ten days, cadres' ideological concerns have been generally resolved. Cadres in each village have implemented the calls and resolutions of the county congress, implemented a system of reporting every three days, and closely linked up and down. The following situations and experiences were reported: For example, after the large and small cadres of Yushui Village examined their mistakes, they led the masses to actively produce, rectify mutual aid, and solve the previously existing wage issues. Eight households that had been struggled against also received wages, especially Yang Longbao and two other wrongly struggled households, each receiving more than 40 *jin* of wages, solving the immediate problem of not having food and drink. After receiving their wages, they are even more motivated in production. In nine days, the entire village's thirteen groups, with eighty-eight laborers, cultivated 155 *mu* of hillside land, reclaimed 37 *mu*, and reclaimed a total of 55 *mu* during planting. They planted turnips and vegetables to help solve the problem of having food and drink in July and August. The masses reflected: The leadership of the cadres is indeed different from before the spring planting.

Last year, most of the villages in the entire district had poor harvests, and the disaster is now more serious. Each village has 20 to 30 households that currently do not have food and drink. Cadres went deep into each group, mountain village, and household to understand the difficulties in the lives of the masses. In villages such as Ku Jun and Hongni, where the disaster is severe, cadres discussed with the masses and organized the masses to produce for self-salvation. Before and after planting in Kujun Village, the masses were organized to transport goods, earning rice and money to solve the difficulties of not having food and drink. Some villages are collecting firewood in preparation for burning it while weeding; in villages such as Hongni and Huaishuping, the early-planted millet has begun to be weeded. The cotton in Hongni has mostly been weeded once. Village cadres led the masses, taking time in the morning to weed all 140 *mu* of cotton once, and some had been weeded twice, all emphasizing technique. The first weeding was very shallow, just loosening the soil and removing the grass. After the rain, they all ridged the wheat fields and planted corn, rushing to harvest two crops. In addition, cadres read the appeals in the newspaper for thrift to overcome the famine and also promoted them among the masses. District cadres also strengthened the allocation of base point villages to lead and promote sideline production in general villages after planting and before weeding.

The production enthusiasm in each village is high. The main reason is that the cadres' thinking has been cleared up, and they have actively risen to lead the masses in production to overcome the famine. They also promoted the policy of uniting with middle peasants in various natural villages, rectifying mutual aid teams, and correcting deviations. For example, in the rectification of production organizations in Xiqiaogou Village, group leaders were elected democratically. This time, middle peasants were also elected as group leaders. After the election, the middle peasants reflected that they dared to speak now and would work hard with everyone in the future to produce well. Currently, the entire district is launching a weeding campaign in conjunction with sideline production. (Hai Zhong, Shi Xiu)

　　平顺六区干部党员积极领导
  　全区展开锄苗运动
    群众说：干部和春耕前大不一样了！
    【平顺消息】平顺六区各村干部经过在县参加了全县扩干会议，干部、党员解决了思想混乱，积极领导生产，初步呈现新气象。经这十天的工作汇报，干部思想顾虑是普遍的解决了，各村干部都执行了县大会号召与决议，执行了三天一汇报的制度，上下密切了联系。据汇报有如下的情况和经验：如裕水村大小干部检讨了自己错误后，领导群众积极生产，整顿互助，解决前存的工资问题，有八户被斗户也得了工资，特别是错斗户杨龙保等两户，每户得工资四十余斤，解决了当前没吃喝问题。得了工资，生产上更有劲，九天全村十三组，八十八个劳力，山坡地一百五十五亩，开荒三十七亩，带下种时共开荒五十五亩，栽蔓菁种菜接济七八月早吃喝问题。群众反映说：干部领导和春耕前确实不一样了。
    全区去年绝大部分村是歉收，现在灾荒较严重，每村都有廿至三十户当下没吃喝。干部回去深入各组山庄各户，了解群众生活困难。如库峻虹霓等村，灾荒严重，干部在群众中讨论，组织群众生产自救。库峻村下种前后，组织群众运输，赚米赚洋解决了没吃喝困难。有的村正在打柴，准备锄苗的烧燃；有虹霓、槐树坪等村，早种的谷已开始锄；虹霓棉花大部锄了头一遍，村干部领导群众，抽空早上将一百四十多亩棉花全锄过一遍，有的已锄过二遍，都讲技术。头遍锄的很浅，只是松了土，除了草，雨后都往麦地起垄，种了玉茭，赶收两季。另外干部看了报上的节约渡荒号召，也在群众中作了宣传，区干部也加强配备了基点村领导推动一般村下种后锄苗前的副业生产。
    各村生产情绪是高涨了，主要原因就是干部思想打通了，积极的起来领导群众生产渡荒，并在各自然村宣传了团结中农的政策，整顿互助组、纠了偏。如西桥沟村整顿生产组织中，民主的选举组长，这次也选了中农当组长，选后中农反映这就敢说了，今后要和大家好好生产。现全区正结合副业展开锄苗运动。（海忠、世秀）
