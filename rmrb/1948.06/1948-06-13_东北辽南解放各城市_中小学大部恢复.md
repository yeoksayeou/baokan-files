　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. Most primary and secondary schools in the newly recovered cities of Liaoyang, Haicheng, Anshan, and Yingkou in southern Liaoning have resumed operations. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 20,000 students have returned to school. In order to implement the policy of winning over, transforming, and cultivating intellectuals, the democratic government attaches great importance to supporting education. The Liaoyang Municipal Government organized some of the original teaching staff to study at the education research class run by Anshan City. After graduation, they initially solved the problem of teachers for secondary education. Anshan City opened a training class for primary school teachers, recruiting more than 200 intellectuals who, after graduation, were assigned to 10 primary schools in the city as teachers. The Anshan City United Middle School has also been established, with more than 1,600 students. Haicheng City United Middle School has officially opened, with more than 1,300 students enrolled. The city's primary schools have also increased from five in the Chiang Kai-shek puppet era to seven. Within two days of opening, more than 1,470 children had registered for enrollment, many of whom were children who could not attend school in the past due to family poverty. Since liberation, teachers and staff in Yingkou City have been freed from the hardships of life. The United Middle School has now been established in the city, and in the first five days before the official start of registration, more than 800 young people came to inquire and apply for the exam. Primary schools in the city have resumed classes one after another and are already full.

  　中小学大部恢复
    【新华社东北十日电】辽南新收复城市辽阳、海城、鞍山、营口等地之中小学校，已大部恢复。据不完全统计，复课之学生已近两万名。为贯彻执行争取改造与培养知识分子的方针，民主政府对扶助教育事业亟予重视。辽阳市政府，曾组织原有教职员一部到鞍山市所办之教育研究班学习，毕业后初步解决了中等教育的师资问题。鞍山市开办小学教员训练班，招收二百余知识分子，毕业后分配到该市十个小学担任教员。该市联合中学亦已组成，现有学生一千六百余名。海城市联合中学已正式开学，入学者一千三百余名。该市小学亦由蒋伪时代之五所增至七所，开学两日，即有千四百七十余名儿童报名入学，其中有很多是过去因家庭贫苦而根本进不了学校的儿童。营口市自解放后，教职员已解脱了生活的困苦，现市内联合中学已告成立，报名正式开始的前五天中，即有八百余青年前来接洽投考，市内小学已相继复课，并已呈满员状态。
