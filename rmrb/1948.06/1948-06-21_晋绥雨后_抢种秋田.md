Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th. After the rains, various areas of Jin Sui are rushing to plant autumn fields. Reports from various areas indicate that they can guarantee that all farmland will be sown. In Shenfu County (a newly established county, formed from parts of Shenmu and Fugu counties in northern Shaanxi), which suffered the most severe disaster, the area planted and replanted has reached 120,000 mu. Together with the land already planted, the total reaches 600,000 mu. The total land in the county is 720,000 mu, leaving only 120,000 mu, which will also be completely planted before the summer solstice. More than 160 households of disaster-stricken people in the county have returned to their villages to cultivate. Seven units at the Jin Sui Border Region level will抽调 (chōu diào) 120 staff members to form a shock brigade to help with planting in the disaster area of ​​the county. In Renjiawan Village, Xing County, 340 mu were planted in one day after the rain, an average of 6 mu per household. Four households in the village that did not work hard had eaten most of their loan grain and had not planted their land well. After persuasion and supervision by the farmers' association, they decided to complete sowing within three days. The farmers' association continued to lend them food rations and supervised them to rush to plant. In order to urgently rush to plant, Baode County issued short-term credit loans of 250,000 yuan in farm currency, and organized 63 cadres to go to the countryside to work, determined to complete the county's planting before the 20th of this month. Forty Mile Gully Village in Shenchi County demonstrated the class love of the system in the rush planting work. The village lacked seeds, and young farmer Wang Dekui took out 50 taels of silver saved by his father to buy seeds. Communist Party member Dang Xiaopeng said: "I have cattle, I will help others eliminate six mu of wasteland." Then other farmers also helped each other. The whole village has full confidence in eliminating the barren land. Outside Shuoxian city, there are 92 mu of sandy land, and the farmers volunteered to plant it. After the government's persuasion and promotion, and with the help of 100 dan of fertilizer, the farmers have begun to cultivate this sandy land, determined not to let it go to waste.

　　晋绥雨后
  　抢种秋田
    【新华社晋绥十七日电】晋绥各地乘雨后抢种秋田，各地报告均可保证全部耕地下种。灾情最重的神府县（新设县，陕北神木、府谷两县各一部），抢种、补种面积已有十二万亩，加上过去已种的土地，共达六十万亩。全县土地共七十二万亩，现仅余十二万亩，亦将在夏至节前抢种完毕。县内受荒灾民已有一百六十余户返乡耕种。晋绥边区一级的七个机关单位，将抽调出一百二十个工作人员，组成抢种突击队，赴该县灾区帮助抢种。兴县任家湾村，雨后一天内就抢种三百四十亩，平均每户种六亩，该村有四户不好好劳动的人，吃完了大部分贷粮，还没有种好地，经农会说服督导后，他们决心在三天内播种完毕，农会继续贷给他的口粮，并监督他去抢种。保德县为紧急抢种，特发放短期信用贷款二十五万万元农币，组织了六十三个干部下乡工作，决心在本月二十日以前全县抢种完毕。神池县四十亩沟村在抢种工作中发挥了制度的阶级友爱。该村种籽缺少，青年农民王德魁把他父亲积存的五十两银子拿出来买种籽。共产党员党小朋说：“我有牛，我帮助别人消灭六亩荒地。”接着其他农民也纷纷相助。全村对消灭熟荒有充分信心。朔县城外有九十二亩沙地，农民都志愿种，经政府说服推动，并帮助他们一百担肥料，农民已开始在这块沙地上耕作，决心不让它荒掉。
