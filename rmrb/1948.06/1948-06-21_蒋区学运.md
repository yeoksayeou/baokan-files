　　△Students at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou held a one-day strike on May 20th to protest the large-scale massacre and arrest of students by the Chiang bandits in Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places during the "May 20th" incident last year. Two students from the school were recently expelled for publishing patriotic remarks on the wall newspaper.
    △The Chiang party authorities in Shanghai are plotting to advance the dates of the semester exams in an attempt to disintegrate the students' patriotic and democratic movement.
    △On April 18th, during a temple fair performance in Tianshui, Gansu, Chiang's bandit military police injured an elementary school student with a leather belt. When students from Tianshui Middle School stepped forward to advise them, the military police fired shots in intimidation, and tied up Yang Junjie, a third-year junior high school student from the school, and took him to the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters for torture. When the students sent representatives to request his release, the Chiang bandit officer ordered soldiers to fire rifles and machine guns, chasing and shooting Wang ＠, a second-year junior high school student from the school, to death at the school gate. He Naifeng, a vocational school student, was injured in the leg. All the students of Tianshui Middle School issued an open letter to people from all walks of life, accusing the brutal massacre with grief and indignation.

　　蒋区学运
    △杭州浙江大学学生曾于五月二十日罢课一天，抗议去年“五、二○”蒋匪在南京、天津等地大规模屠杀逮捕学生。该校学生二人最近因在壁报上发表爱国言论，横遭开除。
    △沪市各大学蒋党当局正阴谋提前本学期大考日期，企图借此瓦解学生爱国民主运动。
    △四月十八日，甘肃天水庙会演戏时，蒋匪军警以皮带打伤一小学生。天水中学学生上前劝告时，军警竟鸣枪恫吓，并将该校初中三年级学生杨俊杰捆往警备司令部稽查处吊打。当学生推派代表前往请求释放时，蒋匪军官竟下令士兵以步枪机关抢射击，将该校初中二年级学生王＠追至校门枪击毙命。职中学生何乃丰腿部受伤。天水中学全体学生为此发表告各界人士书，悲愤控诉此次残酷的屠杀。
