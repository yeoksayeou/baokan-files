　　Zhehu Village After Final Accounting
  　Hastens to Deliver Manure, Preparing for Rushing Planting
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatches] After rectifying their thinking, the cadres and masses in Zhehu Village, District Nine of Xingtai, have revitalized their production work. After the village cadres attended the district's production meeting, they reviewed and corrected the problem of relaxing leadership. They launched a final accounting in each mutual aid team. In the past, Jin Changyi originally planned to buy sesame cakes to take to the wheat fields, but upon hearing about equal distribution, he decided not to buy them. Yao Lianbao not only abandoned the idea of fertilizing the pea fields twice but also started eating and drinking extravagantly. This phenomenon was very common. With a total of eight hundred people in the village, estimated at a waste of three *sheng* of grain per person per month, the entire village wasted seventy *shi* of grain in three months. The production committee proposed to remedy this loss. If each *mu* of the village's eleven *qing* of land were to receive two more sesame cakes and produce one more *dou* of grain, a total of one hundred and fifteen *shi* of grain could be added. The women also proposed to weave two more *jin* of cloth each, to exchange for grain in the fall. Cadres and the masses worked together, with twelve mutual aid teams and one hundred laborers, delivering seventy-five hundred loads of manure to the edge of the wheat fields in five days, preparing to sow quickly after the wheat harvest. The elderly and children treated the "oil drought" on the cotton, curing one hundred and forty-four people in three days. To welcome the wheat harvest, the cadres proposed that each person go deep into a team, based on last year's experience, with old and young working together, planning to finish the wheat harvest in four days. If it does not rain after the wheat harvest, they will carry water to rush planting. The masses also selected Yao Lianchi to manage the time, ringing the bell to get up and go to the fields, and everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. (Quan Fu, Zhiguo, Jingyi)

　　折虎村经过总算帐
  　赶忙送粪准备抢种
    【本报消息】邢台九区折虎村干部群众，经过整顿思想，生产工作重新活跃起来。村干部参加了区的生产会议后，检讨并纠正了放松领导的毛病，在各互助组发动了一次总算帐。过去，靳昌议本来准备买麻饼上麦地的，一听说平分不买了。姚连保不仅打消了往豌豆地上两次肥的想法，并且大吃大喝起来。这种现象很普遍，全村八百口人，以每人每月浪费三升粮食算，三个月全村浪费七十石粮食。生产委员会提出补救这个损失，全村十一顷地，每亩增上两个麻饼、多打一斗粮食，共可增加一百十五石粮食。妇女也提出每人多织二斤布，到秋天换粮食。干部群众一齐动手，十二个互助组，一百个劳力，五天往麦地边送粪七千五百担，准备割了麦子很快下种。老头和小孩治棉花上的“油旱”，三天治好一百四十四人。为迎接麦收，干部提出每人深入一个组，根据去年经验，老少齐下手，计划四天收完麦子。麦后如不下雨，就担水抢种，群众并选出姚连池掌握时间，打钟起床下地，大家生产情绪很好。（全福、治国、景义）
