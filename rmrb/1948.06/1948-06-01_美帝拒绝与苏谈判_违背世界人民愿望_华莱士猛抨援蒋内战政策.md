Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—Wallace, the presidential candidate of the U.S. Third Party, challenged Vandenberg, Marshall, and Connally, the creators of the U.S.'s reactionary so-called "bipartisan foreign policy," on the 22nd, demanding ten public debates with them on U.S. foreign policy. Wallace broadcasted: "In the past two weeks, the Soviet government has twice responded to the U.S. proposals, believing that the time has come to end the Cold War" (Editor's note: The so-called "Cold War" refers to the diplomatic and propaganda war waged by the U.S. reactionaries against the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people through war intimidation; because it does not involve open fire, it is called the Cold War.) "to reach an agreement, but the U.S. government and politicians of the Republican and Democratic parties have poured cold water on the people's fervent hope to end the Cold War. The U.S. government says: 'We are already involved in further negotiations.' But the people's answer is: 'We abhor war; we need peace.'" Wallace continued: The U.S. government's excuses for refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union are not only weak but also shameful. He said: Truman, Marshall, Vandenberg, and Connally fear that once their policies are exposed and made public, they will arouse the resentment of the American people. They also fear that the people will reveal how this policy has stained our hands with the blood of innocent people in China, Greece, and Palestine. Wallace finally listed the ten topics to be debated as follows: (1) Is U.S.-Soviet peace possible? (2) Universal disarmament and security issues. (3) U.S. policy towards Germany and Japan. (4) Issues of China and Korea. (5) U.S. relations with Latin America. (6) The Marshall Plan. (7) The Middle East and the Mediterranean. (8) The utilization of world resources and trade issues. (9) Methods to expand global democratic rights. (10) Methods to strengthen the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—Wallace, the presidential candidate of the U.S. Third Party, vehemently criticized the U.S. government's policy of "aiding the corrupt and dictatorial Chiang Kai-shek government." Wallace stated: "The weapons that the United States has given to China (referring to the Kuomintang government) since the victory over Japan have not only aroused hatred among the Chinese people." He continued: "In the three years since the victory over Japan, we have given the corrupt and dictatorial government of Chiang Kai-shek five billion U.S. dollars in aid; but even so, this cannot prevent the final collapse of Chinese feudalism. In the past three years, the weapons that the U.S. has shipped to China each month have averaged eight and a half times the amount we shipped to China each month from the Pearl Harbor incident to the victory over Japan." Wallace pointed out: "A State Department report reveals that we gave gasoline and incendiary bombs to China, and Chiang Kai-shek used these weapons indiscriminately to massacre Chinese civilians, which not only ignited their opposition to Chiang Kai-shek himself but also ignited their hatred of the United States. Our hands are stained with the blood of countless Chinese people."

　　美帝拒绝与苏谈判
  　违背世界人民愿望
  　华莱士猛抨援蒋内战政策
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】美第三党总统候选人华莱士，于二十二日向美国反动的所谓“两党外交政策”的制造者范登堡、马歇尔、康纳利提出挑战，要求和他们举行关于美国外交政策的十次公开辩论。华氏广播称：“过去两周中，苏联政府虽两次答复美国的建议认为结束冷战”（编者按：所谓“冷战”，是指美国反动派以战争恫吓对苏联及所有爱好和平的人民所进行的外交战和宣传战，因为并不开火，故被称为冷战。）获致协议的时机已至，但美国政府及共和、民主两党的政客们，却对人民结束冷战的热望泼上一盆冷水。美国政府说：“我们已卷于再事谈判”。但人民的回答则是：“我们厌恶战争，我们需要和平。”华氏继称：美政府不愿和苏联谈判的借口不仅是无力的，而且是可耻的。他说：杜鲁门、马歇尔、范登堡、康纳利害怕他们的政策一旦被揭破，并公诸于世后，将引起美国人民的反感。他们也害怕人民揭破这种政策如何把中国、希腊和巴勒斯坦无辜人民的鲜血沾在我们的手上。华氏最后列举应行辩论十次的题目如下：（一）美苏和平是否可能。（二）世界普遍裁军与安全问题。（三）美国对德日政策。（四）中国及朝鲜问题。（五）美国与拉丁美洲的关系。（六）马歇尔计划问题。（七）中东及地中海问题。（八）世界资源之利用与贸易问题。（九）扩大全球民主权利之方法。（十）加强联合国之方法。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】美第三党总统候选人华莱士，猛烈抨击美国政府“援助腐败独裁蒋介石政府”的政策。华莱士称：“美国自对日胜利以来，所予中国（按指国民党政府）之武器，不仅在中国人民中激起仇视情绪。”继称：“在对日胜利以来之三年中，我们已给蒋介石腐败独裁政府五十亿美元之援助；但纵使如此，这也不能避免中国封建主义之最后崩溃。过去三年中，美国平均每月运给中国的武器为珍珠港事变至对日胜利期间我们每月运给中国武器之八倍半。”华氏指出：“国务院报告泄露我们把汽油和烧夷弹给予中国，而蒋介石即不分皂白地用这种武器去残杀中国平民，这不仅燃起他们反对蒋介石本人，而且也燃起了他们反对美国的仇恨之火，我们的手上染满了无数中国人民的鲜血。”
