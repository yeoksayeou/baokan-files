【Taihang News】After the Chinese Communist Party's Beiliu Branch in Licheng underwent party consolidation, its appearance was completely renewed, and the prestige of party members among the masses was greatly enhanced. After the party consolidation, the branch re-elected the branch committee and established various work systems. At party meetings, the party members discussed various activities, leadership methods, reporting and reviewing, and exchanging experiences, criticized party members who were not actively working, and commended party members who were doing well. When implementing the party's policies, the branch always studied and discussed them first. When cadres and party members could grasp the party's policies, they then publicized them to the masses. During the "draw from the excessive and supplement the deficient" (抽补) campaign, party members actively publicized the policy, enabling it to be quickly implemented among the masses. The masses understood the bottom line of the policy and focused on production; they also voluntarily returned over-occupied fruits. He Xianmei returned three mu of land, three rooms, and one cave dwelling, influencing non-party cadres who had over-occupied fruits to return them, thus completing the "draw from the excessive and supplement the deficient" campaign. Party member Zhang Yuxing compiled the party's policies for each stage of work into a quick-rhyme performance, publicizing them to the masses in the dining areas, streets, and fields, making it easier for the masses to accept the policies. The branch's prestige among the masses was greatly enhanced, and various farmers' association groups vied for party members to participate. Duan Yuanhe said: "Our group can't do without a party member. Without a party member, we have no guide! We want Liu Zhongjing to participate." Shen Ying's wife suggested at the establishment of the Farmers' Representative Assembly: "Wang Xiaoping must come to our group, without a party member consultant, we can't lead the work." Out of the village's thirty-six party members, twenty were elected as representatives to the Farmers' Representative Assembly, three were elected to the presidium, and branch secretary Liu Youcai was elected chairman of the Farmers' Representative Assembly. The masses praised: "Party members are our guides, our chiefs of staff, we can't do without party members."

　　经过整党党员密切联系群众
  　北流支部威信提高
    【太行讯】黎城北流中共支部经过整党后，面貌焕然一新，党员在群众中的威信大大提高。整党后支部改选了支委，订出各种工作制度。在党的会议上讨论党员各种活动、领导方法、汇报检讨、交流经验，批评不积极工作的党员，表扬工作好的党员。执行党的政策时，总是支部首先学习讨论，在干部和党员能把握党的政策时，再到群众中宣传。在抽补时，党员即积极宣传抽补政策，使党的政策很快贯彻到群众中，群众摸着政策的底，安心生产；并自动退出多占果实，何先妹退出了三亩地、三间房、一孔窑，影响全村多占果实的非党干部，都把多占果实退出，完成了抽补。党员张玉兴把每段工作中党的政策，都编成快书，在饭场、街上、地里向群众进行宣传，使群众能更容易接受政策。支部威信在群众中大大提高，农会各小组都争着要党员参加进去。段远贺说：“俺这个组没有一个党员可不行，没有党员就没有了引路人啦！我们要刘仲景参加”。申英老婆在成立农代会时提议说：“王小平可得来俺这个组哩，没有党员参谋，我们就领不了工”。全村三十六个党员，有二十个当选为农代会代表，三个被选进主席团，支书刘有才当选了农代会主席。群众都这样称赞着说：“党员是咱引路人，是咱参谋长，离了党员可不行”。
