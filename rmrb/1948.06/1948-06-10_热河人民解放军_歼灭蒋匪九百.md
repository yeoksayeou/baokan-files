Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liaoning, 6th. The People's Liberation Army on the Rehe front pursued Chiang's troops who retreated from Pingquan and Anjiangtun (north of Gubeikou) on the 26th and 27th of last month, annihilating more than 900 men. In the latter half of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in these two locations, fearing annihilation by our army, fled in panic towards Chengde. Our army then tracked and pursued them, annihilating a portion of them between Shangxiabancheng, east of Chengde, and Zhangbaiwan, west of Chengde, killing 117 enemies, wounding 118, and capturing 700. We seized one anti-tank gun, one mountain gun, three 60mm mortars, one flamethrower, seventeen light machine guns, nine submachine guns, three rifle grenade launchers, more than 430 rifles and carbines, sixty-one bayonets, more than 1,280 rounds of various artillery shells, 138,350 rounds of ammunition, one radio station, nine telephones, five automobiles, and twenty-four mules and horses.
