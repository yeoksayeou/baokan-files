[Taihang News] Leadership organs at all levels in Taihang are paying close attention to production for self-relief in disaster areas. Fan, the commissioner of the Second Administrative Office, and Jia, the commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Office, have both personally gone to the disaster areas to investigate. According to investigations in 207 villages in Yuanshi (newly liberated in the First District), Zanhuang (close to Yuanshi), and the border areas of the Second District, including Taigu, Shouyang, and Pingding, the disasters caused by the Jiang-Yan bandits and natural disasters have resulted in 82,261 disaster victims. In Yuci, disaster victims have been found eating Guanyin clay (white clay, a sign of extreme famine). In Ye County, the disaster is also very serious due to the looting by Jiang bandits. The First, Second, Third, and Fifth Administrative Offices have all conducted special discussions on spring plowing production and disaster relief based on the actual situation, instructing all counties and districts to distribute emergency relief grain on one hand according to the severity of the disaster, and on the other hand, to fully organize the masses to engage in production for self-relief. Disaster victims in Pingding, Yuci, Shouyang, and Qi County have successively received 3,500 shi of relief grain. Taihang First Administrative Office has allocated 473,832 jin of relief grain (including last year's) and 100.05 million yuan in loans (冀鈔, Ji currency, same below) to Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Lincheng, and Neiqiu. The masses in non-disaster areas such as Xingtai and Gaoyi, under the slogan of "Farmers of the world are one family," raised 803,172 jin of bran and vegetables last winter and distributed them to disaster victims in Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu, and other counties. In addition, local cooperatives and village production committees are also organizing everyone to engage in production through various methods. The masses in Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, Yuanshi, Anyang, Ye County, Xiyang and other counties are using part of their labor force to persist in spring plowing, while another part is engaged in transportation, working, lifting rails, digging licorice root, boiling saltpeter, and repairing roads to solve the difficulties of spring plowing.
