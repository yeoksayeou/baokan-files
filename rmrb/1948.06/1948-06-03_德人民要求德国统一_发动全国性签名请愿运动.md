　　The German People Demand German Unification
  　Launch Nationwide Signature Petition Campaign
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st -- Comprehensive Report: The signature petition movement "The German People Demand German Unification" has vigorously unfolded, starting from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. According to the resolution of the Second German People's Congress in mid-March, all 65 million German people will freely sign the petition "The German People Demand German Unification" within the three weeks from May 23rd to June 13th to demand that the Allied Control Council formulate a German unification law and allow a national referendum to resolve the German unification issue. As of the 25th, in the Soviet-occupied zone, which has a population of 18 million, 6 million people had signed the petition. On the 23rd, a city-wide conference was held in Berlin to call on the people of Berlin to participate in the signing. The German signature movement has received the active support of the Soviet occupation authorities. The Soviet Berlin Commander believes that "referendum is a legitimate and fundamental right of every German and will help accelerate the establishment of a democratic and peaceful Germany." However, this movement has been banned by the American and French occupying authorities, who are eager to split Germany. The American occupation commander, Clay, openly slandered this movement as "communist propaganda." The occupiers falsely claimed that the movement was "hypocritical nationalist propaganda," and therefore used all their brutal police threats and persecutions. However, the German people's universal desire for unification, even the mouthpiece of American imperialism, the Associated Press, could not help but admit: "It is well known that almost every German wants his country to remain unified." (Berlin dispatch on the 23rd) The agency also predicted that the signature movement would also be carried out secretly in the West German occupation zone, regardless of the Western authorities' ban.

　　德人民要求德国统一
  　发动全国性签名请愿运动
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合报导：“德国人民要求德国统一”的请愿签名运动，已从德境苏占区开始蓬勃展开。根据三月中旬第二届德国人民代表大会的决议，全德六千五百万人民，均将在五月二十三日至六月十三日的三周内自由签署于“德国人民要求德国统一”的请愿书上，以要求盟国管制委员会制定德国统一法，并准许举行全国公民投票复决德国统一问题。迄二十五日为止，拥有一千八百万人口的苏占区，已有六百万人签名于请愿书。二十三日柏林召开了一次全城性的大会，号召柏林人民参加签名。德人签名运动得到苏占领当局的积极支持，苏方柏林司令认为“复决是每一个德国人合法而基本的权利，且将有助于加速成立一个民主和平的德国。”但此一运动遭到亟图分裂德国的美法占领当局的禁止，美占领军司令克莱公然诬蔑这一运动为“共产党的宣传活动”，占领者则诡称：该运动为“民族主义的虚伪宣传”，因此极尽其粗暴的警察威胁和迫害之能事。但是德国人民普遍要求统一的意志，连美帝喉舌合众社也不能不承认：“几乎每一个德国人，都愿他的国家保持统一，这是众所周知的事。”（二十三日柏林电）该社并预料签名运动在西德占领区亦将秘密进行，而不顾西方当局的禁令。
