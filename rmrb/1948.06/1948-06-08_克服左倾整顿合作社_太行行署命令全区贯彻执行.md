Overcoming Leftist Deviations to Rectify Cooperatives
　　Taihang Administrative Office Orders Implementation Throughout the Region
　　[Taihang News] In order to change the situation of cooperative collapses caused by "leftist" adventurism, to invigorate the rural economy, and develop agricultural and sideline production, the Administrative Office here specifically decided on several principles for resolving existing problems in rural cooperatives on March 17th and ordered all special districts, counties, and cities to resolutely implement them. The order stated: During the land reform, because we did not clearly define the boundary between capitalism and feudalism, we also confiscated part of the shares of landlords and rich peasants in the cooperatives. After the Three Check-ups and Study, emphasis was placed on the poor and hired peasant line, and the shares of landlords, rich peasants, and even individual middle peasants were either confiscated or transferred to the names of poor and hired peasants. Since the promulgation of the Land Law, under the pretext of preventing landlords and rich peasants from transferring property and cadres from being corrupt and taking more profits, their funds were frozen. Furthermore, due to our abandonment of leadership, the poor peasant groups (or hired worker groups) spontaneously organized in large numbers of villages dismissed the cadres of the cooperatives and replaced them with poor and hired peasant chairmen and accountants, or sent poor and hired peasant representatives to reside in the cooperatives to monitor everything. Some cooperatives therefore lost money, collapsed, or had unclear accounts, making it impossible to distribute dividends. Others, due to one-sidedly serving the poor and hired peasants, extended credit that could not be recovered, or collapsed entirely due to the distribution and use of shares. Due to the above reasons, cooperatives are generally in a state of stagnation and collapse, causing a serious stagnation of the rural economy (there are also other reasons), greatly damaging the conditions for developing rural production, and causing serious losses to all peasants. In order to change this situation, the following principles are decided for resolving the existing problems of cooperatives: (1) It is strictly forbidden to struggle against and confiscate the shares of landlords and rich peasants in the cooperatives. Landlords and rich peasants who transfer their land and property to the cooperatives should be welcomed without exception and are not allowed to be struggled against. Shares that have been struggled against and confiscated but not yet distributed, or only transferred to the names of the masses, even if distributed but not yet damaged or depleted, should be immediately and unconditionally returned to the original owners. If they have been distributed and consumed, compensation should be given according to the circumstances using undistributed profits or other methods. The government may provide low-interest or interest-free loans to support them. All shares of middle peasants must be resolutely and fully returned. (2) All frozen shares, regardless of whether they were frozen before or after the May Fourth Instructions, must be unconditionally unfrozen and returned to the original owners (including landlords and rich peasants). If they are undistributed struggle fruits, those that can be distributed to the masses should be distributed; those that cannot be distributed should be used as public shares, to be distributed again when the deficit is made up, together with their dividends. If village cadres have taken more profits, and it has been confirmed that they have taken more, they can be ordered to withdraw and compensate the masses. If they are village public properties, they can be used to relieve disasters or compensate the losses of wrongly struggled households, or to resettle landlords and rich peasants. If they are not needed, they should still be placed in the cooperative for production, but they must abide by the principle of the cooperative serving the masses, share dividends equally with the shares of the masses, and must not be forced to take more or designate the amount of dividends. (3) All cooperatives taken over by poor peasant groups or hired worker groups, whether in whole or in part, should be returned and restored to normal, and all the masses should be immediately organized to carry out production. (4) The cadres of the cooperatives should be treated with the policy of enthusiastically reforming them, and they must never be kicked away and ignored. Individual elements who are extremely bad and unanimously opposed by the broad masses should be dismissed or reformed after being subjected to mass struggle. Especially those cadres who were wrongly dismissed due to manipulation by poor peasant groups, who are talented, capable, experienced, and without faults, should be admitted to have made mistakes, and encouraged to return to the cooperative to serve the masses. For those who lie down and do nothing, the masses should be guided to find a way out, given appropriate education to make them realize their mistakes, accept the criticism of the masses, and test themselves in continued hard work. (5) Representatives sent by poor peasant groups to the cooperatives to supervise or control everything should be persuaded by the masses to withdraw. If there are individual good ones who have proven that they can competently perform a job in the cooperative, they can continue to be employed, but they must be told that they cannot be a poor and hired peasant representative supervising others and interfering in everything in the cooperative, but should become a cooperative cadre serving all members and the masses, and must listen to the leadership of all members and the chairman.

　　克服左倾整顿合作社
  　太行行署命令全区贯彻执行
    【太行消息】此间行署为改变由于“左”倾冒险所造成的合作社垮台局面，活跃农村经济，发展农副业生产，特于三月十七日决定解决农村合作社现存问题的几个原则，并命令各专、县、市坚决贯彻执行。该命令称：在土地改革中，由于我们没有明确资本主义与封建主义的界限，把地主富农在合作社的股金，也没收了一部。三查学习后，强调贫雇路线，把地主富农甚至个别中农的股金或没收或转帐到贫雇名下。土地法公布以来，又借口怕地富转移财产，干部贪污、多占果实，冻结了他们的资金。又由于我们放弃领导，使大批村庄自发组织起来的贫农团（或佣雇组）将合作社的干部撤职，换成了贫雇社长、贫雇会计，或派贫雇代表住在合作社内监视一切，有的因此而赔钱、垮台，或弄的帐目不清，无法分红。或因片面的为贫雇服务，将资本赊出无法要回，或因分用股金，而全部垮了台。由于以上种种原因，使得合作社较普遍的处于停顿、垮台的境地，使农村经济陷入严重的停滞状态（还有其他原因），极大的破坏了农村发展生产的条件，全体农民受到了严重的损失。为改变这一局面，决定解决合作社现存问题的几个原则：（一）严禁斗争没收地主富农在合作社的股金，地主富农将其土地财产转入合作社者，应一律欢迎，不准斗争。其股金已被斗争没收，但尚未分配，或仅转到群众名下，虽已分配，而尚未损坏耗完者，均应立即无条件的退还原主。如已分配并消耗者，视情况用未分配之果实或其他方法给以补偿，政府可给低利或无利贷款扶持之。对中农则必须坚决的全部退还。（二）所被冻结之股金，不管五四指示前或五四指示后，都一律无条件的解冻，归还原主（地主富农在内）。如系未分之斗争果实，能分配给群众者分配出，不能分配者作为公共股金，待填补时连其红利一块再行分配。如系村干多占果实，已肯定其为多占者，即可令其退出补偿给群众。如系村公产，可作为救济灾荒或补偿错斗户的损失，或安置地主富农之用。如不需要，仍应放在合作社生产，但必须服从合作社为群众服务之原则，与群众股金平等分红，不得勒令多分或指定分红数目。（三）凡为贫农团或贫雇小组接收之合作社，不管全部或一部，均应退还恢复常态，立即组织全体群众进行生产。（四）对合作社的干部，一本热情改造方针，绝不能一脚踢开，置之不理。极其恶劣，为广大群众一致反对的个别分子，经过群众加以撤职或改造后，尤其在生产运动中立功抵过，对被贫农团操纵斗错解职之有才干、有能力、有经验、而没毛病之干部，应向其承认错误，动其重回社内为群众服务。对于躺倒不干者，应通过群众指示出路，给以适当的教育，使其认识自己的错误所在，接受群众的批评，在继续努力工作中考验自己。（五）贫农团派进合作社进行监视、或控制一切的代表，应经过群众说服，一律撤出。如有个别好的，已证明其在合作社内能胜任一种工作者，仍可继续留用，但必须向其说明，他不能是作为一个贫雇代表在合作社监视别人，干涉一切，而应成为一个为全体社员群众服务的合作社干部，要听从全体社员与社长的领导。
