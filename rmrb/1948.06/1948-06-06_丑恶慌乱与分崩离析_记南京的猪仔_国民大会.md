　　Ugliness, Panic, and Disintegration
　　A Record of the Piglet "National Assembly" in Nanjing

The Nanjing Piglet "National Assembly," which opened on March 29th, announced its closure on May 1st. The ugliness of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is becoming increasingly unbearable, they are becoming more panicked in the face of the people's victory, their internal strife is becoming more apparent, and their disintegration is becoming more visible. These are the three major characteristics displayed by this farce. Before this play was staged, and after its performance, judging from the reports in the Chiang-controlled newspapers, the bizarre shapes were truly surpassing Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun's "Parliament." Particularly ugly were five items: the dispute over representatives, the dispute over the presidium, the dispute over reviewing the military, the dispute over revising the puppet constitution, and the dispute over the puppet vice president.

Seventy-five percent of the piglet representatives participating in this "National Assembly" were Kuomintang members; the China Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, who sold themselves out, and a few of Chiang Kai-shek's followers such as Hu Shih and Mo Teh-hui, were supporting actors in this farce. The piglet representatives themselves called this "National Assembly" a "Party-People's Assembly" (Yi Shi Bao). Tragically, even the "National Assembly" could not be held properly. First, the issue of "representative" qualifications caused an ugly dispute. This dispute started before the meeting and continued until the closing. Originally, the "representatives" were produced by the Kuomintang Central Committee's designation and the nomination of the Minqing parties. Chiang's State Council once decided that "party members may not be elected without nomination." However, the Kuomintang, which is seeing its foundations collapse, is also losing control over its party members. More than 600 Kuomintang members who were not "nominated" but were elected by so-called "voters" through bribery still existed. The Kuomintang ordered them to give way to party members and the Minqing parties who had been "nominated," so they organized the so-called "Association of Popularly Elected Representatives" to resist, which made the stinking latrine of the pseudo-election even stinkier. To solve this ridiculous problem, the Kuomintang came up with a ridiculous solution: all those who "yielded" would be made members of the so-called "Pacification Committee," with a simplified Grade A treatment and a basic salary of 720. Then, the Kuomintang Central Committee made an even more ridiculous decision: "Yield again in two years, and if you don't yield by then, you will be expelled from the party." Then, Chiang Kai-shek also staged a ridiculous new "summons." However, whether it was a "basic salary of 720," "party membership," or Chiang Kai-shek's "summons," they were all equally worthless in the political market. Therefore, a transaction was ineffective. On the day before the opening of the pseudo "National Assembly," a "popularly elected representative" who called himself a "candidate for democratic martyr" actually bought a coffin, claiming that "if he doesn't enter the venue, he will enter the coffin." And in order to win "US aid," he specially laid in the coffin at the request of an American reporter and stuck his head out to take a photo. Another ten people sat in the assembly hall and went on a "hunger strike." On the day of the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized a group of burly men to surround the "Association of Popularly Elected Representatives," and carried the ten "stubborn elements" out of the venue like chicks, and secretly moved the "martyr's" coffin away with a truck and sank it into the Yangtze River. The concrete coffin disappeared, but the coffin, as a symbol of the pseudo "National Assembly" and as a symbol of Chiang Kai-shek's rule heading towards death, could not be moved away by any truck.

On March 29th, this farce began with gongs and drums. A Tianjin newspaper called it "like a low-class opera house," and scolding and "boo" sounds became a feature of every meeting. The preparatory meeting was held from March 30th to April 5th. Because the candidates for the presidium and the pseudo-vice president were closely related to the election, the competition for the presidency became a topic of quarrel among the Kuomintang factions in the preparatory meeting. "The fierce activities unfolded to compete for the presidium are like discussing market conditions on the stock market. There are thousands of gestures, and all parties have great control. Some 'representatives' stared at each other and pouted because of the candidates." (Yi Shi Bao) On the 3rd, the election of the chairman involved all sorts of despicable acts. Some people shouted that there were missing people on the ballot, some scolded bastards, some shouted for refunds, and some shouted for fights. The venue was in chaos. More than fifty piglets who did not get a ticket crowded onto the stage and questioned why they did not have a ticket, while someone on the meeting voted three or four tickets.

The official assembly started on April 6th. According to Chiang Kai-shek's intention, he only needed to be elected as president and then the meeting would be over. However, this play was staged when Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis was so serious that it could not be resolved. The large and small reactionaries sitting in the assembly hall felt the fear of the end. When discussing the rules of procedure, they demanded to review the Chiang bandit government's policies. Therefore, on the first day of the formal meeting, it was impossible to step down, and as a result, the method of cutting off the power to disable the loudspeakers was used to force the adjournment. This problem has been going on for three days, and every day there is stomping and table slapping, booing and roaring of "get down". On the last day, the low-class director Chiang Kai-shek of the low-class opera himself took the stage. Seeing that the stage was full of people rushing to grab the microphone, he had to pretend to be stupid and sit "quietly in a hidden seat on the stage... reading the newspaper in his hand." (Associated Press)

From the 9th, Chiang Kai-shek and his staff were forced to make policy reports. Even their own henchmen were unwilling to listen to their set of ghost words. When Chiang Kai-shek reported, even the vice-presidential candidate Cheng Qian was snoring. During the other central agency's self-proclaimed "fatigue report" period, the venue was sparse, "some were recuperating, some were chatting, some were eating peanuts, and the female 'representatives' were taking off their shoes and fiddling with their feet, and some were combing their hair." (Yi Shi Bao) However, even during such reports, the piglets were not completely quiet. They could ignore everything, but they could not forget to "review the military." In order to stabilize people's hearts, Chiang Kai-shek gave a myth in the meeting, saying that his rule was "absolutely safe" and that the military plan had "been fully achieved" and that "the foundation of finance is very solid." Regarding this myth, the pro-Chiang Kai-shek United Press also reported that Nanjing "most neutral observers treat this speech with suspicion." Many piglet representatives who pinned their hopes on this dictator not only "greatly doubted," but also openly revealed his hypocrisy. On April 10th, Zhou Yanguang, a "representative" from Henan, believed that Chiang's report was not true and said on stage: "I am not satisfied with the chairman's report yesterday." As soon as this remark came out, the audience was in an uproar. Some "representatives" stood up and shouted to fight, but all the Henan "representatives" supported him, one of whom shouted: "Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are about to be lost, aren't you allowed to speak?" (Yi Shi Bao) On the 12th, "Bai Chongxi's report on the military situation aroused fierce debate, and they complained about the government's corruption and incompetence... concealing the truth." (Associated Press) Bai Chongxi's report was interrupted several times by the shouts of "Don't talk about food, please report on the strategy of Northeast and North China," "Think of a way, think of a way to alleviate the serious military situation." As soon as the military report was over, "Zhao Yongfu, a 'representative' from Ping, grabbed the microphone with both hands and shouted in a trembling voice: 'Shoot Chen Cheng'!" (Yi Shi Bao) "In the afternoon military review... 'representatives' from Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Rehe provinces stated that the situation in their respective provinces was serious, no less than in the Northeast. A 'representative' from Jiangsu stood up and explained that since ancient times, if the Huai River is not protected, it will be difficult to secure the south of the Yangtze River. A 'representative' from Anhui shouted that northern Anhui was terrible, and a 'representative' from Hubei shouted loudly, please don't ignore central China." (Central News Agency) On the 13th, Yu Hongjun "was about to report on economic issues, but was pushed away from the loudspeaker by an emotional 'representative'. The 'representative' shouted: "The Communist Party has already acquired parts of Northeast, North China, and Central China. They have crossed the Yellow River and may cross the Yangtze River and advance towards Nanjing. Why don't you let us talk about the true military situation?" (Associated Press) "When He Yingqin said that the conference must abide by the agenda, he was booed down by the 'representatives'. The hissing and roaring in the venue lasted for nearly an hour." (United Press) The entire venue was like a bunch of ants on a hot pot, and the order was so chaotic that it could not be maintained. "Gu Zhenggang took the stage and shouted loudly, asking the 'representatives' to be vigilant about the danger of the overall situation, saying that student unrest had occurred in Pingrong, and that they should not waste time here, but should choose to discuss the matter and complete the election as soon as possible." (Yi Shi Bao) Only the fear of "dangerous overall situation" can be used to calm the fear of "dangerous overall situation," which shows how panicked the reactionaries are in front of the people!

After April 15th, the discussion of revising the pseudo-constitution changed from trouble to fighting. The pseudo-constitution in the hands of the dictator Chiang Kai-shek was originally a decoration to protect dictatorship, but because no one paid attention to it, it actually did not play a role in deception. In order to attract people's attention, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately created a so-called "constitutional amendment" movement, saying that this "constitution" was quite "democratic"; at the same time, he, the Minqing parties, and some Kuomintang members deliberately pretended not to agree with amending the "constitution", only adding a so-called "Temporary Provisions during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion", pretending that this group of "opposing the majority" minority was quite loyal to democracy. In this way, a group of idiots was driven from one bullring to another. According to the descriptions of Chinese and foreign journalists: On the 15th, a female 'representative' spoke, "only said a few words that she did not agree with amending the constitution, and was booed and scolded by the audience, and even shouted to fight, and the audience was in chaos." (Central News Agency) On the 16th, "when the Constitutional Amendment Review Committee met," "the emotions between the 'representatives' were agitated, causing a short period of fist fighting. One 'representative' announced: 'I now and forever oppose interfering with the constitution.' Another 'representative' stood up and punched him, and the hitter slipped out of the venue before he was recognized." (Associated Press) On the 17th, the atmosphere inside and outside the venue was tense, "In the morning, Wang Peiji of the China Democratic Socialist Party spoke, saying that even the people who scolded the constitutional amendment proposal had problems, big representatives controlled small representatives... Before he finished speaking, there was a burst of 'what nonsense', 'bullshit', 'fight fight fight' sounds, and the whole audience was boiling, everyone left their seats and waved their fists." (Pingming Daily) At the same time, a group of "popularly elected representatives" outside the venue were fighting fiercely with the military police, causing all the participants to withdraw. In the so-called constitutional amendment review meeting, there was also a crowing and chattering, and finally, under the supervision of Chiang Kai-shek, the so-called review report was passed by standing vote. After the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek gave a special lecture, saying that "seeing the situation in the venue just now, I can't help but say a few words... The most important thing for you to meet here is to maintain order... If you still don't maintain order, it will make Chinese and foreign people feel extremely pessimistic." (Xin Xing Bao) On the 8th, the "Temporary Provisions during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion" proposed by Hu Shih, Mo Teh-hui, and others were passed according to Chiang Kai-shek's plan, and Chiang Kai-shek could arrange to be "president"; but even so, "Chinese and foreign people" still could not help but feel extremely pessimistic, "because, on the same day, the 'CC' group instructed a group of Anhui people to demonstrate at the meeting, shouting 'Down with Li Pinxian', and the police beat them with pistol holsters, injuring twelve people, and several people were seriously injured." (Reuters) This signal indicates that the internal struggle of the reactionaries has not eased, but has become more tense. The struggle of false faces turned to the struggle of true faces, and turned to the battle for the vice presidency, that is, the battle for the inheritance of Chiang Kai-shek's throne.

Becoming "president" was originally Chiang Kai-shek's long-cherished wish, but this political rogue was born at the wrong time. By the time he arranged to become "president," he had completely fallen into the abyss of destruction. He even had no way to find another person to be president and still maintain his precarious rule. Chiang Kai-shek, who had been pursuing the presidency all his life, was finally being pursued by the "presidency," being pursued by the ghosts of Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun, and being pursued by the fate of the guillotine that reactionary rulers could not escape. But Chiang Kai-shek's tragedy is not limited to this. The reactionary ruling class, together with his master, the US imperialists, decided to do a happy event for Chiang Kai-shek at the same time, and also decided to do a funeral for him, decided to find an "anti-Chiang" "vice president" to succeed the old Chiang Kai-shek, "in order to extend the life of the reactionaries when the situation is even worse, so Li Zongren, who was appreciated by the American boss and supported by the politically savvy political and academic circles and miscellaneous warlords, decided to compete with Sun Ke, who was supported by the 'CC' system and Chiang Kai-shek himself, for 'vice president'." In the mutual attacks of several candidates, Nanjing Xinmin Daily openly published an announcement from the Nanjing Transportation Service Agency saying: "Chiang Gong should use his international prestige to visit Europe from time to time... If Mr. Li can be elected, he will be more than competent to stabilize the current situation and has the conditions for foreign affairs." That is to say, Chiang Kai-shek deserves to get out, and Li Zongren should handle the aftermath. The "CC"'s Central News Agency specifically broadcast this announcement to force Li Zongren to retreat. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized all the Kuomintang forces to help Sun Ke. "Some 'representatives' even received threats that if they did not obey the party's instructions, they would be expelled from the party." Cheng Qian was also "ordered directly by Chiang to withdraw from the election, so that Sun Ke could win the election with ease." (Reuters) In such struggles, and countless other bizarre struggles, the "vice president" election was held three times in a row without results. Finally, Li Zongren announced his withdrawal from the election and claimed that he would leave Nanjing. In this way, "Chiang Kai-shek succumbed to the will of the United States, and Li Zongren 'won' behind the will of the United States." A Chinese newspaper once published a message saying: "US Ambassador Stuart Leiden played a role in persuading Sun Ke to withdraw." (Associated Press) Stuart Leiden made a "thirty taels of silver are not buried here" style of denial of this. American newspapers almost unanimously supported Li Zongren. The New York Herald Tribune's Shanghai telegraph on April 25 said: "If the time comes to negotiate peace with the CCP, Li Zongren is far more acceptable to the Communist Party than Chiang."

From the beginning, the Chinese people despised this stinking so-called "National Assembly" and what "president" and "vice president" are, and people only regarded it as a series of dirty jokes, a new officialdom expose like never before. The Chiang Kai-shek clique performed this "National Assembly" in a sweat, thinking that it could whitewash the peace, but the result was that its internal disintegration was even more serious, and the ruling crisis was even more serious. As soon as this piglet National Congress closed, the black market price of the US dollar broke through 1.2 million Chiang coins, three times higher than at the end of March. Prices immediately soared, and Shanghai white rice rose to 5 million Chiang coins per tan, an increase of 500,000 overnight, "Market speculators are using the split in the Kuomintang's election issue to further deteriorate the economic situation." (Reuters) On May 3rd, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to more than a thousand party members who were "National Assembly representatives," saying: "I will do my best until my death." When Chiang spoke at this secret meeting, "his tone was hoarse due to emotional excitement" (Associated Press). Chiang Kai-shek can only "die" with his rule and with the feudal comprador monopoly property of the four major families. Yuan Shikai became emperor, and Cao Kun became president. What followed was a complete defeat, betrayal, and the collapse of the tree and the dispersal of monkeys. The Northern Warlord clique then came to an end. Chiang Kai-shek is about to reach the end of this old road. But this time, not only will Chiang Kai-shek perish, but the entire Chinese reactionaries will also perish together.

　　丑恶慌乱与分崩离析
  　记南京的猪仔“国民大会”
    三月二十九日开幕的南京猪仔“国民大会”，于五月一日宣布闭幕。蒋介石反动集团的丑态，越来越不成样子，在人民胜利的面前越发慌乱，其内部越发互相倾轧，其分崩离析越发表面化，是这场活剧所表现的三大特色。在这场戏上演之前，及其演出之后，从蒋区报纸的报导看来，奇形怪相，比之袁世凯、曹锟的“国会”，真是青出于蓝。其中特别丑恶的，是五项节目，即：代表之争，主席团之争，检讨军事之争，修改伪宪之争，与伪副总统之争。
    参加这个“国大”的猪仔代表，百分之七十五是国民党员；卖身投靠的民社党与青年党，以及胡适、莫德惠等几名蒋介石的随从，则是这幕丑剧的龙套配角。猪仔代表自己也把这个“国大”称为“党民大会”（益世报）。悲惨的是连“国民大会”也开不好，首先是“代表”资格问题，就引起了丑恶的纠纷。这个纠纷从开会之前，一直闹到闭会为止。原来“代表”的产生，是由国民党中央圈定，和民青两党提名的办法规定下来的。蒋记国务会议曾经决定：“党员非经提名不得当选”。但是，日见土崩瓦解的国民党，对于它的党徒也正在丧失控制的力量。各地未经“提名”而在贿选中由所谓“选民”签署选出的国民党员，仍有六百多名。国民党命令他们让给曾经“提名”的党员和民青两党，他们就组织了所谓“民选代表联谊会”实行反抗，这就使伪选的臭毛厕愈搅愈臭。为了解决这个滑稽的问题，国民党想出了一个滑稽的办法：凡“退让”的，都作所谓“戡乱委员会”委员，以简任一级待遇，底薪七百二。接着，国民党中常会又作了一个更滑稽的决定：“当两年再让，到时不让，开除党籍”。接着，蒋介石还来了一场滑稽的新自“召见”。但是“底薪七百二”也好，“党籍”也好，蒋介石“召见”也好，在政治市场上都已经一样的毫无价值。因此一场买卖毫无效果。到了伪“国大”开幕的前一天，有一个自称“候补民主烈士”的“民选代表”，居然买了一具棺材，声称“不进会场就进棺材”。并为了争取“美援”起见，特应美国记者之请，躺在棺材里，伸出头来拍了一张照片。另有十个人，则坐在大会堂内，实行“绝食”。闹到开会那天，蒋介石为了粉饰门面，就动员了一批彪形大汉，把那个“民选代表联谊会”包围起来，把十个“廿地”象小鸡似地挟出会场，并且用卡车把“烈士”的棺材偷偷搬走，沉入长江。具体的棺材是不见了，但是棺材作为伪“国大”的象征，作为蒋介石统治走向死亡的象征，却不是任何卡车所能搬走的了。
    三月二十九日，这幕丑剧锣鼓开台了。天津一家报纸称之为“有如下等歌剧院”，叫骂和“嘘”声成为无会必具的特点。三十日至四月五日开预备会议，因为主席团的人选和伪副总统的竞选大有关系，争夺主席席位，便成为国民党各派在预备会中吵闹的题目。“为竞选主席团展开的炽烈活动，一如证券市场上讲行情，姿态万千，各方控制力甚大，有些‘代表’因争候选人，彼此瞪眼撅嘴。”（益世报）三日选举主席，鸡鸣狗盗一齐出场，有人嚷叫选票上漏了人，有骂混蛋，有喊退票，有呼打的，会场一片大乱。五十多个没有拿到票的猪仔，拥到主席台上，质问他们为什么没有票，而会上又有一人投了三四张票的。
    四月六日起开正式大会。按照蒋介石的意图，只要选了他当总统就散会完事。可是这出戏是在蒋介石的军事危局严重到不可收拾的情况下扮演的，坐在会堂里的大小反动派们，都感到末日的恐惧。讨论议事规则时，纷纷要求检讨蒋匪政府的施政方针。因此，正式会议的第一天，就闹得下不了台，结果用了停电使扩音器失效的手段，才算强迫休会。这个问题一直闹了三天，天天都是顿足拍桌声，嘘声和“滚下来”的咆哮声。最后一天，下等歌剧的下等导演蒋介石自己登场了，他看着台上台下到处都在豕突狼奔地争夺着扩音器，只好装痴装呆，“静静地坐在台上的隐蔽席位上，……读他手里的报纸”。（美联社）
    从九日起，蒋介石和他的僚属被迫作施政报告。他们的一套鬼话，连自己的喽罗们也不愿听。蒋介石报告时，连副总统候选人程潜都呼呼入睡。在其他中央社自称的“疲劳报告”期间，会场上疏疏落落，“有养神的，有闲谈的，有吃花生的，女‘代表’有脱鞋弄足的，有梳头的。”（益世报）但是，即使在这样的报告期间，猪仔们也不是完全安静的，他们什么都可以不管，但他们不能忘记“检讨军事”。为了安定人心，蒋介石在会上大讲神话，说他的统治“基础是绝对的安全”，军事计划都“已完全达到”，“金融的基础非常的巩固”。对于这篇神话，亲蒋介石合众社也报导说：南京“大多数中立观察家，都是以怀疑来对待这一演说”。把命运寄托在这个独夫身上的许多猪仔代表，不仅“大大的怀疑”，而且公然揭出他的虚伪。四月十日，河南“代表”周炎光，认为蒋的报告不确实，上台说：“我对主席昨天的报告不满”，此语一出，全场顿时骚动，一部“代表”起立喊打，然全体河南“代表”支持他，其中一个高呼：“开封、郑州都要丢了，还不准说话吗？”（益世报）十二日，“白崇禧报告军事形势，激起激烈辩论，纷纷埋怨政府腐败无能，……隐瞒事实真相”。（美联社）白崇禧的报告，几次为“不要说伙食，请报告东北、华北战略”，“要想办法呀，想办法减轻严重的军事形势呀”的吼声所打断。军事报告刚一结束，“平‘代表’赵庸夫，双手抱住麦克风，以发抖的声音连喊：‘枪毙陈诚’！”（益世报）“下午军事检讨，……河北、山东、山西、热河等省‘代表’，纷纷说明各该省形势严重，并不下于东北。江苏‘代表’起而阐明自古江淮不保，江南难安。安徽‘代表’高呼皖北不得了，湖北‘代表’大声疾呼请大家不要忽视华中。”（中央社）十三日，俞鸿钧“正打算报告经济问题，被一个情绪激动的‘代表’从扩音器前推开，这个‘代表’大声喊道：“共产党已经取得了东北、华北和华中的一部，他们曾横渡黄河，而可能横渡长江，并向南京推进，你们为什么还不让我们讲讲军事的真实情况呢”？（美联社）“当何应钦说大会须遵守议程时，他就给‘代表’轰了下去。会场的嘶声吼声几达一小时。”（合众社）全场象一堆热锅上的蚂蚁，秩序混乱到无法维持。“谷正纲上台大声疾呼，要求各‘代表’警惕大局的危险，谓平蓉二地已发生学潮，不应在此浪费时间，应当择要讨论，早日完成选举。”（益世报）只能用“大局危险”的恐惧来镇定“大局危险”的恐惧，足见反动派在人民面前慌张成了什么样子！
    四月十五日以后，讨论修改伪宪，就由闹进到打了。独裁者蒋介石手中的伪宪法，本来就是保护独裁的装饰品，但因无人理会，所以事实上也起不了什么欺骗的作用。蒋介石为了要引起人们的注意，就故意制造了一个所谓“修改宪法”的运动，说得这部“宪法”好象颇为“民主”的样子；同时，他和民青两党及一部分国民党员，又故意装出并不赞成修改“宪法，只要加上一个所谓‘戡乱时期临时条款’，装得这伙‘反对多数’的少数好象颇为忠于民主的样子。就是这样，居然把一群白痴由一个斗牛场又赶进了另一个斗牛场。据中外新闻记者的描写：十五日某女‘代表’发言，‘仅说出不赞同修改宪法几字，即被全场嘘骂，甚至叫打，全场混乱。’（中央社）十六日，‘宪法修改案审议委员会开会时，’‘代表’间的情绪激动，引起了短时期的拳斗。有一‘代表’曾宣布：‘我现在并且永远反对干涉宪法’。另一‘代表’便起而一拳，打人者在没有被认出是谁之前，便溜出会场了。”（美联社）十七日，会场内外均笼罩于紧张气氛中，“早上民社党王培基发言，说什么修改宪法提案，连骂的人都有问题，大代表控制小代表……。说犹未了，一片‘什么话’，‘狗屁’，‘打打打’声，全场鼎沸，人人离座，拂袖挥拳。”（平明日报）同时，在会场门外一群“民选代表”则与宪兵凶殴，闹得大会全体退席。在所谓修宪审查会中，也是一片鸦鸣鹊噪，最后才在蒋介石监督之下，以起立表决通过了所谓审查报告。会后，蒋介石特地训了一顿话，说是“看到刚才会场上的情形，我不能不说几句话。……诸位在这里开会，最要紧的就是守秩序。……如果还不守秩序，给中外人士看到都要感到极端的悲观。”（新星报）八日，由胡适、莫德惠等提出的“戡乱时期临时条款”，按蒋介石的计划通过了，蒋介石可以安排好做“总统”了；但是，虽然如此，“中外人士”还是不免于感到极端的悲观，“因为，同一天‘ＣＣ’团又指使了一群安徽人到会场示威，高呼‘打倒李品仙’，警察用手枪皮套打了他们，十二人受伤，数人伤势甚重。”（路透社）这个信号，表示反动派内部的斗争不是更和缓了，而是更紧张了。由假面目的斗争，转到真面目的斗争，转到副总统的争夺战，亦即蒋介石王位继承的争夺战上来了。
    做“总统”本来是蒋介石的宿愿，但是这个政治流氓生不逢时，等到他安排好做“总统”的时候，他已经完全坠入灭亡的深渊，他甚至没有办法找到另一个人当总统，而又能保持他垂危的统治。一生追逐总统的蒋介石，最后是被“总统”所追逐着，是被袁世凯、曹锟的阴魂所追逐着，是被反动派统治者无法逃脱的断头台命运所追逐着。但是，蒋介石的悲剧还不止此而已。反动的统治阶级连同他的主子美帝国主义者，在决定替蒋介石做喜事的时候，同时就决定了替他做丧事，决定了找一个“反蒋”的“副总统”来作老朽的蒋介石之继任者，“以便在大势更加不妙的时候，‘副总统’可以用‘反蒋’的姿态出而延长反动派的寿命，因此得到美国老板的赏识为善观风色的政学系和杂牌军阀所支持的李宗仁，就决心与受‘ＣＣ’系和蒋介石自己支持的孙科竞选‘副总统’了”。在几个候选人的互相攻讦中，南京新民报公然刊载南京交通服务社的启事说：“蒋公应利用其国际威望，不时欧游访问…………李先生如能膺选，对于安定时局，胜任有余，对外亦具条件。”就是说，蒋介石活该滚蛋，李宗仁理合善后。“ＣＣ”的中央社特别广播了这个启事，来压迫李宗仁退却。同时蒋介石动员了国民党一切力量，帮助孙科。“有些‘代表’甚至接到如不服从党的指示，即将开除党籍的威胁。”程潜还“奉到蒋的直接命令，退出竞选籍，以使孙科在选举中从容获胜。”（路透社）在这样的斗争，以及其他无数稀奇古怪的斗争中，“副总统”的选举一连举行了三次都没有结果，最后李宗仁宣布退出选举，并声称将要离开南京。这样，“蒋介石在美国意志的面前屈服了，李宗仁在美国意志的背后‘胜利’了。”某中国报纸曾载一项消息称：“美大使司徒雷登在劝请孙科退出上曾起作用”。（合众社）司徒雷登对此作了“此地无银三十两”式的辟谣。美国报纸几乎一致替李宗仁捧场。纽约先锋论坛报四月二十五日上海电讯说：“假如与中共议和的时机来到，李宗仁远较蒋易为共方接收”。
    中国人民对于这个臭得刺鼻的所谓“国民大会”，以及什么“总统”、“副总统”，从一开始就是加以鄙视的，人们只把它看作一串肮脏的笑话，一篇闻所未闻的新官场现形记。蒋介石集团满头大汗地演出了这幕“国民大会”，满以为可以粉饰一下太平，而结果却是他的内部更加分崩离析，统治危机更形严重。这个猪仔国大刚一闭幕，美金黑市价格即突破蒋币一百二十万元，比起三月底来，涨了三倍。物价立即猛涨，上海白米每担涨到蒋币五百万元，一夜之间，激涨五十万，“市场投机者，正在利用国民党内选举问题上的分裂，使经济情势更加恶化。”（路透社）五月三日，蒋介石曾经向任“国大代表”的千余党员发表演讲，他说：“我将鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”。蒋在此次秘密会中发言时，“其声调因情感激动而嘶哑”（美联社）。蒋介石现在只有和他的统治一道，和四大家族的封建买办垄断财产一道“死而后已”了。袁世凯当了皇帝，曹锟作了总统，随之而来的便是一败涂地，众叛亲离，树倒猢狲散。北洋军阀集团也接着归于覆灭。蒋介石把这条老路已经快要走到尽头。但是，这一回不但蒋介石要归于灭亡，整个中国反动派也要一齐归于最后的灭亡了。（新华社）
