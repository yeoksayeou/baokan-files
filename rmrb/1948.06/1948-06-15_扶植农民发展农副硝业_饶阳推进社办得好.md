Supporting Farmers in Developing Agricultural and Sideline Nitrates
Raoyang Promotes Cooperatives Well
[Hebei Central News] The Raoyang County Production Promotion Cooperative has shifted from its past purely commercial ideology. Based on the production needs of the masses, it supports rural agriculture, sideline industries, and nitrate production. The masses have earned a lot of money, and the cooperative's business has also developed significantly.
The cooperative was originally a county-run store. After improving it into a promotion cooperative, the county secretary and county magistrate personally presided over the first promotion cooperative conference, helping cadres resolve ideological concerns such as being afraid of not finding business in the countryside and not being able to earn enough to eat. The county party committee pointed out: Truly developing business according to the needs of the masses and properly managing the businesses the masses need will certainly not lose money. If the masses' production is supported well, even if money is lost, the general cooperative will find a way to help solve the problem. The county party committee supplemented the promotion cooperative with twenty-four cadres and organized thirty-four cadres to go to the countryside to understand the needs of the masses.
The cadres saw that some winnowing machines were idle in the Xiaoyin Village area, and some weaving households lacked capital, so they immediately provided cotton to the masses on credit. Some nitrate producers near the city lacked pots, firewood, and white ash, so these items were immediately transported to supply them. When the masses lacked agricultural tools, the iron and wood factory run by the promotion cooperative stopped manufacturing other items and specialized in manufacturing agricultural tools. As business gradually developed, the promotion cooperative also contacted the public store, which sold the masses' finished products and provided the masses with urgently needed items (such as large pots for boiling nitrate) on credit. When the store bought pockets and the nitrate bureau collected nitrate, they would first provide some deposit money to the masses as capital. This truly achieved mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors.
In more than two months, the promotion cooperative issued production loans of 803,665,000 yuan (border currency), driving private capital of 30,189,000 yuan and floating wealth of 9,521,500 yuan. Through loans, 3,739 production groups were organized in 95 villages, including 2,188 poor peasants and 714 middle peasants. This solved the difficulties of many poor peasants, farm laborers, and disaster-stricken villages.
The promotion cooperative supported the nitrate industry, expanding from 58 villages to 75 villages, with 79 new nitrate pools and 26 nitrate pots. There was abundant nitrate soil in the Ligang area, but the masses lacked nitrate boiling technology. The promotion cooperative mobilized three experienced nitrate boilers to Ligang to boil and teach at the same time. Seeing that money could be made, the masses were all mobilized. 173 large pots, 4,900 catties of white ash, 40,000 catties of coal cinder, and more than 20 million yuan in firewood funds were given to poor nitrate producers on credit, to be repaid after they earned money from boiling nitrate. The promotion cooperative promptly supplied raw materials and purchased finished products for the pocket and textile industries. According to statistics from the fourth and fifth districts, the number of active pocket weaving machines has increased to 400, bringing along 3,500 spinning wheels. In the past, only 800 pockets were produced in one market, but now it has increased to 3,000. Some textile households lacked cotton, so the promotion cooperative provided it on credit, using methods such as exchanging cotton for thread and thread for cloth to solve their difficulties. The promotion cooperative helped farmers increase their livestock, purchasing five breeding bulls and one breeding donkey, which were handed over to private individuals for breeding. The profits earned were given to the operators. The promotion cooperative launched agricultural loans, and by the end of April, 345,118,000 yuan had been lent out, driving private capital of 187,900,000 yuan. In the early stages, some laboring farmers did not dare to take out loans, fearing that they would not be able to repay them in the future. Individual village cadres and some cunning people wanted to lend indiscriminately. After studying the needs of the masses, they immediately carried out lending in kind, buying thirty cattle from southern Hebei and lending them to the masses at the original price. The iron and wood factory of the promotion cooperative specialized in manufacturing agricultural tools, improving finished products according to the opinions of the masses and selling them at prices lower than the market price. The promotion cooperative supported the production of the masses and also earned money itself. For example, the Nanjingtang branch made a profit of more than 70 million yuan in March, which was more than enough to cover the living expenses of the cooperative's cadres.

　　扶植农民发展农副硝业
  　饶阳推进社办得好
    【冀中讯】饶阳县生产推进社转变过去单纯经商思想，根据群众生产需要，扶植农村农、副、硝业，群众赚了许多钱，推进社的业务也得到长足的发展。
    该社原为县公营商店，改进推进社后，县书、县长亲自主持召开了第一次推进社大会，帮助干部解决了怕下乡一时找不到业务，怕赚不了钱不能吃饭等思想顾虑；县委指出：真正根据群众需要开展业务，正当经营群众需要的业务，一定不会赔钱。如果把群众的生产扶植好了，就是赔了钱，总社也会设法帮助解决。县委给推进社补充了二十四个干部，并组织了三十四个干部下乡，了解群众的需要。
    干部们见小尹村一带有些风弓停着，有的纺织户没本钱，立即以棉花赊给群众。城附近有些硝民缺锅缺柴缺白灰、立即把这些东西运来供给他们。群众缺农具，推进社开办的铁木工厂即停造其他东西，专造农具。营业逐渐发展了，推进社又与公营商店联系，由商店推销群众的成品，并把群众急需的东西（如熬硝的大锅）赊给群众，商店买口袋、硝局收硝时，都先出一些定钱，借给群众当资本。真正作到了公私两利。
    在两个多月中，推进社发放了生产贷款八亿零三百六十六万五千元（边币·下同），带动私资三亿零一百八十九万元，浮财九千五百二十一万五千元。通过贷款在九十五个村庄组织了三千七百三十九个生产组，内贫农二千一百八十八户，中农七百一十四户。解决了许多贫雇农和灾村的困难。
    推进社扶植硝业，由五十八村发展到七十五村，新增硝池七十九个，硝锅二十六口。李岗一带硝土多，群众没有熬硝技术，推进社便动员三个有经验的熬硝把式到李岗，一面熬，一面教，群众看见有钱可赚，都动起来。对贫苦硝民赊出大锅一百七十三口、白灰四千九百斤，煤渣四万斤，柴款两千多万元，在他们熬硝赚钱后归还。推进社对口袋业和纺织业及时供给原料，收购成品，据四、五两区统计，现活动的织口袋机子已增至四百张，带起纺车三千五百辆。过去一集只出八百条口袋，现已增至三千条。有些纺织户缺棉花，推进社就赊给他们。用以棉换线、以线换布的方法，解决他们的困难。推进社帮助农民增殖牲口，已买到五个种牛，一个种驴。交给私人喂养交配，赚了钱归经营人，推进社举办农业贷款，至四月底贷出三亿四千五百十一万八千元，带动私资浮财一亿八千七百万九千元。在初期，有些劳动农民不敢贷款，怕将来还不起，个别村干部和一些狡猾的人则想乱贷，研究了群众的要求后，即举行贷实物，到冀南买了三十头牛，原价贷给群众。推进社的铁木工厂则专制农具，按群众意见改良成品，以低于市价的价钱出售。推进社扶植了群众的生产，自己也赚了钱，如南京堂分社三月份结帐即盈利七千多万元，解决该社干部的生活费用还有富余。
