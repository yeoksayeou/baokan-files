　　Northeast China's Literary and Art Activities in Brief
(Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th)

　　(1) In response to Commander Lin Biao's call at the Northeast Literary and Art Workers Conference in March, literary and art circles rushed to the front lines, went deep into the companies, collected creative materials, and assisted the literary and art work of the troops. The music group headed by Lü Ji, after arriving at the company, experienced the life of the soldiers as preparation for participating in the production of the "People's Liberation Army March"; at the same time, they helped the column and division compile military songs, which were warmly welcomed by the troops. After the woodcarver Gu Yuan went deep into the company, he also helped various troops to report and copy manuscripts, and practiced apprenticeship (that is, leading the technical cadres of the respective troops to carry out creation). They are now drawing comic strips with combat heroes as the theme. The Second Troupe of the Northeast Literary and Art Work Troupe, led by Li Zhihua (who was commended by the Northeast Central Bureau last year for an example of "anti-reversal struggle"), went deep into the company to perform, and was warmly welcomed by the troops. In addition to writing reports on several combat heroes, the female writer Bai Lang is now widely collecting creative materials as she accompanies the army in the battle on the outskirts of Changchun. (2) The Northeast Military Region transferred a large number of art and photography cadres from its subordinate units and concentrated them in Harbin. The Northeast Pictorial Press is responsible for running training courses to improve production standards. The literary and art programs sponsored by the Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League, in order to popularize cultural education, invite writers to give reports every week. Song Zhi's, Liu Baiyu and others have attended and lectured on literary theory, and the audience is enthusiastic every time. After the establishment of the Northeast Literary and Art Work Committee (according to the association was established in March this year, elected Shu Qun, Luo Feng, Zhang Geng, Liu Baiyu, Yuan Muzhi and other sixteen people as members, under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau.), under the promotion of the association, the writers have high creative enthusiasm and are carrying out creations reflecting the life of workers and land reform in rural areas of Northeast China. In order to combat reactionary literary and art activities and improve literary and art criticism, the Literary and Art Work Committee has decided to publish "Literary and Art Monthly," which has already begun to review manuscripts and will be published in mid-July. (3) The Northeast Film Studio finally produced the sixth episode of "Democratic Northeast," which includes: (1) News Briefs. Including: the nine days after the recovery of Jilin, General Wang Jiashan of the Yingkou Uprising, the citizens of Jiamusi donating copper and iron, the Zhaodong Local Corps being promoted to the main force, and the public farm of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, etc. (2) Rural documentary "The Emancipation Tune," including the situation of the land distribution to the large production movement in the Northeast Liberated Area. At the suggestion of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, twenty-seven cadres from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui Liberated Areas, including drama, photography, fine arts, music, and shepherding, were transferred by the Northwest Bureau of the Communist Party of China and arrived at the factory in late May to participate in work and learn technology. At the second anniversary celebration party of the factory on the first of this month, the director of the factory, Yuan Muzhi, used the arrival of Northwest cadres to the factory to illustrate the concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for the people's film industry, giving the people's film industry a bright future for development. He said: In order to welcome the upcoming national victory, it is necessary to train a large number of cadres and save cadres. He called on all comrades in the factory to work hard to strengthen political and service learning in order to shoulder a greater task.
