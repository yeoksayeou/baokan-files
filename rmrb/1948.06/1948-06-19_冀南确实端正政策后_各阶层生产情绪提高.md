(Ginnan News) After more than ten counties in Ginnan, including Guanxian, Yuanchao, Yongnian, Linzhang, Ningnan, Qinghe, Qiuxian, Pingyuan, Hengshui, Yongzhi, and Weixian, began compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants, the production enthusiasm of all classes greatly increased, and escaped landlords returned home one after another. In the land reform last year, some areas infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, affecting the masses' courage to become wealthy. Especially after the promulgation of the Land Law, our publicity and explanation work was poor, coupled with bad elements taking the opportunity to spread rumors, which caused even more confusion in the minds of middle peasants, and their production enthusiasm declined. They doubted and said, "When it's time for production, they call for production, but who knows how it will change later!" After the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Central Bureau issued the correction instructions in January, cadres at all levels held various meetings to explain policies, classify classes, and conduct education on the unity of middle and poor peasants. They first corrected the left-leaning emotions of the cadres, and then persuaded the masses to compensate the middle peasants. It was stipulated that the labels of "struggled households" for middle peasants and the control over middle peasants should be completely abolished, and the sealed doors should be unsealed. Landlords and rich peasants who were driven out of their homes should be given the necessary resettlement. According to incomplete statistics from 203 villages, a total of 587 middle peasant households were wrongly struggled, mostly due to wrongly classified components, and a few were struggled because of conflicts with village cadres. In sixteen villages alone, 119 landlords and rich peasants were driven out of their homes. After the correction, a total of 26 cattle, 55,350 catties of grain, 5,241 catties of cotton, 237,700 yuan of Jicha banknotes, 794 pieces of farm implements and furniture, 700 pieces of clothing, 570 mu of wheat land, and other items were compensated to the middle peasants. In resettling landlords and rich peasants, grain of 38,160 catties, cotton of 700 catties, land of 140 mu, ten weaving machines, and five spinning wheels were distributed according to specific needs. Many wrongly struggled middle peasants have joined the peasants' association. Liu Jinkui, a middle peasant in Zhangguang Village, Qinghe, said: "Previously, they only said that the interests of middle peasants would not be harmed, but I never believed it. Now I can rest assured." After the control over middle peasants was lifted in Xichang Village, Qiuxian, the middle and poor peasants have freely formed seven groups, and have now reclaimed 61 mu of wasteland. After Li Laojun, a middle peasant in Matang Village, Weixian, was struggled last year, his production enthusiasm declined. He only harvested fifteen catties of chives from one plot. This year, after the correction of his component, he harvested thirty catties of chives from one plot. He has made many farm tools this year and is also preparing to buy cattle. He said, "It is still worth it to work hard when classified as a middle peasant." In Xiyan Village, Yongnian, 60 mu of land was distributed to 18 landlords. The landlords, after being distributed the land, said: Now that we have land, we can produce well! Ai Fengqin, an escaped landlord from Aixinzhuang, Ningnan, also returned from Shijiazhuang with his family of ten. The peasants' association immediately gave him land and houses to help him settle down and produce. Chen Guoxuan, a landlord from Dongxiaozhuang, Linzhang, had escaped to Anyang to become a squad leader of the Chiang bandit plainclothes team since the year before last. After Anyang was besieged by us, grain prices soared. Chen Guoxuan once attempted suicide with a razor because he could not maintain his livelihood. Hearing that the Land Law Outline stipulated that landlords could also share the same land and property as peasants, he thought that he could work and produce so that he would not be hungry. So he led his whole family back to his village. The peasants' association saw that he wanted to work and immediately gave him houses and land.

　　冀南确实端正政策后
  　各阶层生产情绪提高
    【冀南讯】冀南冠县、元朝、永年、临漳、宁南、清河、邱县、平原、衡水、永智、威县等十余县开始补偿中农与安置地富后，各阶层生产情绪大为提高，逃亡地主陆续回家。去年土改中，若干地区侵犯了中农利益，影响群众不敢发家致富。特别是土地法颁布后，我们的宣传解释工作差，再加坏分子乘机造谣，引起中农思想更加混乱，生产情绪低落。他们怀疑说：“生产时候叫生产，以后不知怎么变哩！”……一月晋冀鲁豫中央局纠偏指示下达后，各级干部召开各种会议，讲解政策，划分阶级，进行中贫农是一家的教育，先纠正了干部左倾情绪，再说服群众补偿中农。规定中农“被斗户”的帽子和对中农的管制一律取消，被封的门一律启封、对扫地出门的地主给予必需的安置。据二百零三村不完全的统计，错斗中农共五百八十七户，多因错订成份，有少数因与村干闹蹩扭被斗，扫地出门的地富在十六村即有一百一十九户。经纠偏后，共补偿中农牛二十六头、粮五万五千三百五十斤、棉五千二百四十一斤、冀钞二十三万七千七百元、农具家具七百九十四件、衣服七百件、麦地五百七十亩及其他东西一部。安置地富，则根据具体需要，发给粮三万八千一百六十斤，棉七百斤，土地一百四十亩，织布机十架，纺车五辆。错斗中农不少的已参加了农会。清河张广庄中农刘金奎说：“先前光说不妨害中农利益，我总是不信，这可放心了”。邱县西常屯对中农取消管制后，中贫农已自由结成七个组，目下已开荒六十一亩。威县马塘寨中农李老钧去年被斗后，生产情绪低了，一畦子韭菜只割十五斤，今年订正成份后，一畦子韭菜就割了三十斤，他今年制了不少农具，还准备买牛。他说：“划成中农，还是劳动有落头”。永年西沿村将六十亩地分给十八个地主，地主分了地，说：有了地，可好好生产吧！宁南艾辛庄逃亡地主艾凤钦全家十口人，也从石家庄回来了。农会当即给他土地房子，帮助他安家生产。临漳东小庄地主陈国悬自前年即逃到安阳当蒋匪便衣队小队长。安阳被我围困后，粮价暴涨，陈国悬因生活难以维持，曾用剃头刀自杀过一次。听说土地法大纲规定地主也能和农民分同样一份土地财产，他想自己要劳动生产，就困饿不着，于是带领全家逃回本村，农会看见他要劳动，立即给了他房子和土地。
