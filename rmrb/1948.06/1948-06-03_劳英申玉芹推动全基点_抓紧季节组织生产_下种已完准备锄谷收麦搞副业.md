　　Labor Hero Shen Yuqin Promotes Comprehensive Key Point
  　Seize the Season to Organize Production
    Sowing Completed, Preparing to Weed Millet, Harvest Wheat, and Engage in Sideline Occupations
    [This Newspaper's Report] Shen Yuqin, a labor hero from Renzhuang in the Second District of Licheng, since returning from the county meeting, with the help of the work team, first worked to unify the thinking of the cadres, resolved ideological knots among middle and poor peasants, and called on everyone to launch a shock campaign to complete sowing. Learning from last year's experience of suffering losses from late planting, especially the poor peasants and farmhands Mao Hai and Huanqing in his group, who did not harvest enough grain last year and are now running out of food. Shen Yuqin not only helped them solve their difficulties but also mobilized them to plant more improved varieties, preparing for a larger harvest in the autumn. He also personally went to various mutual aid teams to urge everyone to quickly complete sowing and plant more 811 millet and Golden Queen corn. He helped Anti-Japanese War martyr's family member Qiu Ju plant an additional one and a half mu of cotton, telling her to pick more cotton to strengthen weaving and overcome her own difficulties. He also provided the poor peasant Jinsheng with fifteen loads of green manure to increase fertilizer. Under his leadership and promotion throughout the team, the entire village sowed a total of 935.6 mu of autumn land, completing it all by the 22nd. (Production Small Report)
    [Licheng News] The Renzhuang key point in the Second District of Licheng, under the leadership and promotion of labor hero Shen Yuqin, organized a key point production committee for unified leadership of the key point. Each village elected one person to participate in the key point production committee, which studied how to promote mass production according to each season. The villages then held production committee meetings to study production according to specific circumstances. During this year's sowing, the production committee members of each village played a leading role. For example, the masses in the northeast were unwilling to plant millet early, so the production committee found four households, including Wang Enqing and Wang HeKui, as examples, because they did not listen to the government's call last year and planted late, resulting in a smaller harvest and now they have nothing to eat or drink. This experience of these four households was used to resolve the ideological problems of the masses. After the thinking of the masses was unified in this way, millet planting was successfully completed. The production committees of each village played a significant role in spring plowing and sowing. Recently (the 25th), under the promotion of Shen Yuqin, the entire key point production committee was convened again to inspect sowing. The entire key point has completed all sowing, and corn was also completed by the 20th. Everyone then discussed and studied to promote and strive to complete the millet weeding work before the wheat harvest. Wang HeKui said: "We must vigorously promote the masses, weed the millet and apply fertilizer," everyone discussed that they should quickly promote cutting vegetables and engage in sideline occupations with livestock.

　　劳英申玉芹推动全基点
  　抓紧季节组织生产
    下种已完准备锄谷收麦搞副业
    【本报消息】黎城二区仁庄劳动英雄申玉芹，自从县里开会回去在工作组的帮助下首先打通干部思想，解开中贫农思想圪＠，号召大家突击下种。接受去年经验种的晚吃了亏，特别是他组贫雇毛孩和焕清去年没有打下粮食，现在已快没吃的。申玉芹一面帮助他解决困难，一面动员他多种优良品种，准备秋后多打，他又亲自到各个互助组督促大家赶快下种，多种八一一谷金皇后玉茭，帮助抗属妇女秋菊多种了一亩半棉花，叫他多摘些棉花加强纺织克服自己困难。又给贫雇金生调剂买了十五担圊，增加肥料。在他全队的带头推动下，全村共秋地九百三十五亩六，于二十二号全部下完种。（生产小报）
    【黎城消息】黎城二区仁庄基点，在劳动英雄申玉芹的领导推动下，组织了基点生产委会，按基点统一领导。各村评选一人参加基点生产委会，按各个季节研究了如何推动群众生产。各村下去再召开生产委员会，按具体情况研究生产。今年下种中，各村生产委员起了带头作用。如东北群众不愿早种谷，生产委员会就找了王恩庆、王河魁等四户作例，因去年他们没听政府号召，种的迟了少打了粮食，现在没有吃喝。用这四户的经验，来解决群众的思想问题。经这样打通群众思想后，种谷已顺利的完成了。各村的生产委员会，在春耕下种中起了很大的作用，最近（二十五号）在申玉芹的推动下，又召开了全基点生产委员会，检查下种，全基点下种已全部完成，玉茭在二十号也全部完成了，大家又讨论研究，回去推动争取在割麦前完成锄谷工作。王河魁说：“咱可要好好推动群众哩，谷锄寸多上肥，”大家讨论目前应赶快推动割菜，牲口搞副业。
