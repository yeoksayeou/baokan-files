　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government
  　Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee Joint Proclamation
    Strictly Prohibit Treachery, Theft, and Sabotage of Transportation
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee jointly issued a proclamation on June 2nd, strictly prohibiting treachery, theft, and sabotage of transportation. The original text of the proclamation is as follows:
    It has been found that recently, in various places, there have been repeated cases of treacherous merchants colluding with traitors, hooligans, and habitual thieves to steal and trade in electric wires, railway materials, and bridge materials. This is a serious criminal act that violates the interests of the people and sabotages the war effort. In order to eradicate such destructive behavior, the following items are hereby jointly proclaimed:
    1.  Local governments at all levels must be earnestly responsible for protecting transportation facilities and materials such as railways, highways, bridges, and electric wires within their jurisdictions. In districts and villages along the roads and lines, responsibility should be assigned to specific individuals by village and section, delineating the scope, and mobilizing and educating the masses to actively protect them. In the future, if any damage to transportation occurs, the local government shall be held responsible for inadequate protection.
    2.  Everyone has the right to report and expose those who sabotage transportation. They can also hand over perpetrators caught in the act to the government for legal action. The government will give rewards to informers as appropriate.
    3.  Those who sabotage transportation will be severely punished once caught. Those who instigate, bribe, or collude with thieves to sabotage transportation will be punished even more severely.
    It is hoped that all levels of government, merchants, and the people will abide by this proclamation!
