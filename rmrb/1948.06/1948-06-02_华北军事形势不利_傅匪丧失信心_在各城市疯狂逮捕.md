Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Due to the unfavorable military situation, the bandit Fu Zuoyi is increasingly losing confidence in the cities under his control in North China. According to Tianjin newspapers, Bandit Fu has carried out large-scale fascist, frenzied arrests in Tianjin and Baotou. In Tianjin and Baotou alone, more than 2,000 citizens have been arrested. On the evening of April 30th, the Tianjin bandit dispatched military police and secret agents throughout the city to search house by house, arresting anyone deemed suspicious. By 3:00 AM on May 1st, a total of more than 900 male and more than 100 female citizens had been arrested and detained in the empty barracks of the 92nd Army headquarters of Chiang's troops at Haiguang Temple in Tianjin, where they were subjected to various tortures. Baotou City was also placed under martial law for 24 hours on April 25th, with the city gates closed, prohibiting pedestrians. Under this atmosphere of terror, over 1,000 citizens were arrested. After martial law was lifted, Fu's sentries continued to prevent students from Baotou Middle School from returning home for meals and beat students indiscriminately. On the 27th, all teachers and students of the school, led by the principal, went to the Baotou Garrison Command to protest.

  　傅匪丧失信心
  　在各城市疯狂逮捕
    【新华社陕北三十日电】由于军事形势不利，傅匪作义对其控制下的华北各城市日益失去信心。据天津报纸消息：傅匪已在天津、包头两城进行大规模的法西斯疯狂逮捕，仅津、包两市已逮捕市民达两千余人。四月三十日晚，津市傅匪出动全市军警特务，挨户搜索，凡被认为可疑者，即加逮捕。至五月一日清晨三时许，共捕去市民男九百余人，女百余人，寄押在天津海光寺蒋军九十二军军部空营房内，加以各种苦刑。包头市亦于四月二十五日戒严一昼夜，城门紧闭，禁止行人，市民在恐怖压力下，被捕者达千余人。解严后，傅匪岗兵仍阻止包头中学学生回家吃饭，并乱打学生。二十七日，该校全体师生在校长率领下，赴包市警备司令部抗议。
