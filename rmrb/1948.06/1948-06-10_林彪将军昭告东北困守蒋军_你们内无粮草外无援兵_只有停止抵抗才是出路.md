Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th: General Lin Biao, Commander and Political Commissar of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, issued a letter to the Kuomintang officers and soldiers trapped in the cities of Northeast China on May 1st. The original text is as follows:

The imminent total defeat of the Kuomintang army in the Northeast is now recognized by the whole of China and the world. Nine-tenths of the people in the Northeast have already enjoyed the happiness of freedom and peace, and the liberated Kuomintang officers and soldiers have also received generous treatment. Only in the very few urban strongholds you are trapped in, many soldiers and civilians are worried every day, not knowing when they will be killed or starved to death. Now your defense system has been divided, your transportation and communication have been cut off, and Deng Wenyi of the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense has stated on April 7th that no more reinforcements can be sent to the Northeast. You truly have no food or grass inside and no reinforcements outside. Looking at the People's Liberation Army, it is becoming stronger and stronger. The combat effectiveness and firepower of the People's Liberation Army are no longer something your fortifications can resist. The liberation of Siping, Liaoyang, Anshan, Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Yingkou, and other places are iron proofs. Therefore, all your resistance is a useless sacrifice. If you resist, the result will only harm yourselves and the people. At this critical juncture, our army hereby reiterates its sincere advice to all Kuomintang officers and soldiers, Kuomintang government officials, and Kuomintang party members and youth league members who are holding onto large and small towns and strongholds: Our army's consistent policy towards Kuomintang personnel is that the ringleaders must be punished, those who are coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded. In other words, except for a very few who have committed heinous crimes and are stubbornly resisting to the end and must be punished as a warning to others, all other personnel will be treated with leniency. You know that senior military officers such as Chen Linda, commander of the New Fifth Army, Zheng Mingxin, deputy commander of the Fifty-second Army, Hu Jinsheng, commander of the Twenty-fifth Division, Xie Daizheng, commander of the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Division, and Liu Guangtian, commander of the Forty-third Division, have all received our preferential treatment after laying down their weapons; and we have already released people like Chen Jiazhen, the former commander of the Changchun city defense. Anyone of you, as long as you are willing to perform meritorious service for the people, will not only be allowed to atone for your crimes but also be rewarded according to your merits. The following are the regulations of our army's reward and punishment methods, and we hope you will pay serious attention to them, reduce useless resistance and unnecessary sacrifices, and let the besieged soldiers and civilians escape from the sea of ​​suffering as soon as possible so that everyone can be liberated.

(1) Any Kuomintang military officer, adjutant, or sergeant who, when in contact with our army, either adopts a passive attitude, does not force his subordinates to resist resolutely, or quickly lays down his weapons, or seizes the opportunity to jump out of bunkers and fortifications, so that our army can advance smoothly and quickly resolve the battle, regardless of his official position, will be rewarded according to his merits and released on the spot as soon as the battle is over. He will not be sent to the rear, his official title and name will not be announced, and, if necessary, his self-defense weapons will be returned to him.

(2) Any Kuomintang military officer who, after laying down his weapons, can use communication or other methods to persuade his subordinates and neighboring troops who are still resisting to lay down their weapons as soon as possible and achieve the goal, will be rewarded and released on the spot, and his official title and name will not be announced.

(3) Any Kuomintang military personnel who secretly provide our army with important military intelligence, such as the enemy's strength, fortification construction, and combat deployment, which helps our army in combat, will be rewarded according to the value of the intelligence, and secrecy will be maintained on his behalf.

(4) Officers and soldiers serving in the Kuomintang army's artillery, engineering, communications, chemical, and armored units, as well as in military stations, warehouses, should ensure the integrity of the weapons, machinery, equipment, and all other equipment under their control when laying down their weapons, and should not destroy them under any pretext. All those who protect them will be rewarded, and those who destroy them will be severely punished.

(5) Officials, managers, and employees serving in Kuomintang government agencies, banks, postal and telecommunications, railways, mines, and factories must pay attention to protecting the account books, documents, trains, machines, and materials of the agencies and factories they manage, and must not destroy or damage them, and should continue to work as usual to maintain good order. Those who protect them will be rewarded, and those who continue to work as usual will not be treated as prisoners. Those who carry out destruction will be severely punished.

(6) The Kuomintang army units that revolt will be reorganized in accordance with the purpose of the People's Liberation Army to achieve unity between the army and the people and unity between officers and soldiers. Those with a division's worth of soldiers and weapons will be organized into a division, and those with a regiment's worth will be organized into a regiment. Politically, they will be treated the same as our army, and in terms of treatment, they will be equal to our army.
