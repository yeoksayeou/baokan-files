　　【Jizhong News】At the end of May, various counties in the Ninth Sub-district of Jizhong separately convened enlarged cadre meetings at the county, district, and village levels. The meetings discussed eliminating obstacles to mass production, launching a concentrated effort to eliminate wasteland, and vigorously restoring and developing agricultural production. Currently, the large-scale production work in the Ninth Sub-district has not yet been enthusiastically launched, and the production enthusiasm of all classes is not yet stable. There are still concerns about getting rich. Some middle peasants have a fear of becoming wealthy, with some saying, "Getting too rich leads to being bled dry," and "Cultivating three years with one year's surplus is not as good as cultivating one year to eat for one year." Some middle peasants have even engaged in excessive eating and drinking, or they cultivate land according to the average amount per village, leaving the excess uncultivated. After equal distribution, the production enthusiasm of poor and hired peasants has generally greatly increased, but some still have poor production viewpoints. For example, some poor peasants in Shenze say, "Raise an arm and there is firewood and rice." Some landlords and rich peasants do not work hard in production, and some even do not produce at all. Others believe that engaging in sideline occupations is better than engaging in agriculture, the basic reason being fear of increased burdens and another land reform in the future, which has led to the abandonment of some land. According to incomplete statistics from An'guo, Raoyang, Gaoyang, Anxin, Boye, Lixian, Wuji, Shenze, and Anping counties on June 2nd, there are more than 38,000 mu of wasteland. Gaoyang county alone has 21,000 mu of wasteland, most of which belongs to landlords and rich peasants. According to a survey of 2,690 mu of wasteland in Boye, 1,642 mu belonged to landlords and rich peasants, 58 mu to military and martyr families, and 485 mu were undivided land. Each county, based on the production instructions from higher levels and local conditions, convened separate meetings. Summarizing the results of discussions at the enlarged cadre meetings in various places, the following opinions were put forward: (1) Vigorously publicize our Party's land reform and production policies, as well as the Jizhong production reward methods, and the abolition of the progressive agricultural tax system. Explanations and education should be carried out through various meetings, people's schools, radio stations, and wall newspapers to dispel the masses' ideological concerns and increase their production enthusiasm. (2) For land abandoned by middle and poor peasants due to fear of increased burdens or being struggled against for becoming wealthy, it should be publicized that our Party's land reform policy only eliminates feudalism and does not struggle against wealth. Tell middle and poor peasants that future burdens must be fair and reasonable, and increased production will not increase burdens. For middle peasants, the Party's policy of uniting with middle peasants should be emphasized, and their interests should be resolutely protected; those who have been wrongly classified or whose interests have been violated should be resolutely corrected and returned. Poor peasants should be educated that the purpose of land reform is to develop production. After distributing land and houses, they should actively produce and establish a wealthy foundation, which is the permanent and thorough way to become masters of their own fate. The idea of not working hard in production is wrong. (3) Saline-alkali land can be organized to plant alfalfa and red stems, and loans can be provided to solve the problem of lack of capital. (4) Regarding the issue of substitute cultivation for military and cadre families without labor, if they can produce on their own, substitute cultivation should not be implemented. For poor military families who truly have no labor, help should be provided. On the one hand, they can be organized to help each other in production and stimulate production enthusiasm; on the other hand, a self-reporting and public discussion method can be adopted to determine the substitute cultivation method. (5) For landlords and rich peasants who are truly unable to produce, help should be provided to solve the difficulties of tools, seeds, and grain. Those who are able to produce but deliberately do not cultivate should be mobilized to force them to produce. Finally, it was decided to vigorously mobilize the masses around the time of Mangzhong (Grain in Ear) to work hard in production and eliminate wasteland.

　　冀中九分区开各县扩干会
  　发动群众消灭荒地
  　大力发展农业生产
    【冀中讯】九分区各县，于五月底分别召开县区村扩大干部会议。讨论消除群众生产中的障碍，及突击消灭荒地，大力恢复与发展农业生产。目前九分区的大生产工作，还没有热烈的开展起来，各阶层的生产情绪还不稳固，对发家致富还有顾虑，部分中农有怕富的思想，有的说：“过富了被抽肥”，“耕三余一不如耕一吃一”；甚至有的中农发生了大吃大喝现象，也有的按全村平均地数种，将多余的部分不种。平分后，贫雇农生产情绪一般的是大大提高了，但还有个别的生产观点不好，如深泽有的贫农说：“胳臂一举有柴有米”。有些地主富农不努力生产，甚至有个别的根本不生产。还有的认为搞农业不如搞副业强，其基本原因怕增加负担，和今后再来一次土改，由上述原因，而荒芜了一些土地。据六月二日安国、饶阳、高阳、安新、博野、蠡县、无极、深泽、安平九个县不完全的统计，共有荒地三万八千余亩，高阳一县荒地计有二万一千亩，其大部是地主富农的。据博野二千六百九十亩荒地的调查内，地主富农的土地荒了一千六百四十二亩，军工烈属的五十八亩，未分的地四百八十五亩。各县根据上级生产指示及当地情况分别召开会议，综合各地扩干会上讨论的结果，提出了如下意见：（一）大力宣传我党的土改与生产政策，和冀中关于生产奖励办法，以及取消农业累进税制，通过各种会议及民校、广播台、壁报等方式进行解释教育，解除群众思想顾虑，提高生产情绪。（二）对中贫农因怕增加负担或怕富被斗而荒废的土地，应宣传我党土改政策只消灭封建并不斗富。告中贫农说以后负担一定要公平合理，增加生产并不增加负担；对中农应着重说明党的团结中农的政策，坚决不侵犯中农利益；对错定成份及侵犯中农利益者，应坚决纠正和退回。对贫农应宣传土改的目的就是为发展生产。分了地分了房应积极生产，扎下富根，这才是永远的彻底的翻身，不努力生产的思想是错误的。（三）沙碱地可组织种苜蓿、红茎子，对缺乏资本的可贷款解决。（四）无劳力的军干烈属代耕问题，确能自己生产的不实行代耕，对确无劳力的贫苦军属则要帮助解决，一方面可组织起来互助生产，启发生产积极性，另一方面可采取自报公议，规定代耕办法。（五）地主富农真正无法生产的，应帮助他解决工具、籽粮困难，对能生产而故意不种的，应发动群众强制其生产。最后并决定在芒种前后，大力发动群众，努力生产消灭荒地。
