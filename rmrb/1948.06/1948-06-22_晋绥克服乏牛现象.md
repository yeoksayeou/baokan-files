　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th: The phenomenon of cattle fatigue (cattle fatigue refers to the condition where draft cattle frequently lie down due to excessive use and insufficient feed - editor's note) is serious in some areas of the Jin-Sui liberated area. In a village in Shuoxian County, 12 out of 20 draft cattle were fatigued. According to the staff in these areas, the main reasons for cattle fatigue are: First, the ownership of cattle is not clearly defined. When draft cattle are distributed, several people share one head, and no one is specifically assigned to be responsible for feeding them. Farmers in Xiaodaiyue Village, Shanyin County, take turns using draft cattle, and all want to cultivate more land for themselves, causing the cattle to be overworked. However, no one is attentive when feeding them, so the cattle often become fatigued. In some villages in Huairen, the farmers' associations even failed to distribute draft cattle and instead kept them under unified management by the farmers' association. When farmers need to use cattle, they borrow them from the farmers' association; when cattle get sick, the farmers' association treats them. Everyone believes that these are "public cattle" or "farmers' association cattle," so no one pays attention to taking care of them. Second, due to the drought last year, livestock feed was scarce. In some places, grass was not distributed when the cattle were distributed, so farmers could not fatten the cattle. After examining the problem of cattle fatigue, these areas unanimously agreed that these problems should be corrected immediately. First of all, the ownership of cattle must be determined, at least assigning a specific person to feed the cattle, and stipulating that the feed should be supplied by the people who are allocated the cattle according to the proportion of ownership and the proportion of use. A certain amount of remuneration should be jointly agreed upon for the person responsible for feeding the cattle, and the issue of manure distribution should be resolved, etc. In Jiajia Mountain, Lishi, six households shared one head of cattle and decided to have Wu Changyou, a poor peasant, feed it alone. The six households jointly supplied the feed, and the cattle were allowed to rest after work every day to avoid over-fatigue. The farmers' association also conducts inspections at any time and appropriately solves various difficulties in feeding and using cattle based on the specific situation and the opinions of the masses. As a result, the cattle were well-fed. In order to solve the difficulty of cattle feed, some places discovered a wild white grass root that is a good feed and mobilized farmers to cut this grass root to feed the cattle. Xiachahui Village in Yuxian proposed a salt-feeding method, that is, adding five qian or two liang of salt to the cattle feed every day, which can make the cattle stronger and more willing to eat grass.

　　晋绥克服乏牛现象
    【新华社晋绥二十日电】晋绥解放区部分地区乏牛现象严重（乏牛现象指耕牛因使用过度，养料不足而常躺倒——编者）。朔县某村共有耕牛二十头，就乏下了十二头。据这些地方的工作人员研究乏牛的原因，主要是：第一，牛权不确定。分配耕牛时几人共分一头，未指定专人负责喂养。山阴县小岱岳村农民轮流使用耕牛，都愿多给自己耕种，使牛疲劳过度，但饲养时谁都不经心，因而牛多乏下。怀仁某些村庄农会，甚至未分配耕牛，由农会统一保管；农民使用牛时，向农会借用；牛病了由农会医治。大家认为这是“公牛”、“农会牛”，结果是谁也不注意爱护。第二，去年灾荒，牲畜草料困难，有的地方分牛时未分草，农民无法把牛喂肥。这些地方在检查乏牛问题后，一致认为应立即纠正这些毛病。首先必须确定牛权，至少推定专人喂牛，并规定草料由分到牛的人按所有权比例及使用比例供给，共同议定给负责喂牛者以一定的报酬，解决牛粪的分配问题等。离石交家山六户农民共分到一头牛，即推定由贫农吴长有一人喂养，草料由六家共同供给，每日下工就让牛休息，不使牛过于疲乏。农会并随时检查，根据具体情况和群众意见，适当地解决喂牛用牛中各种困难。这样办的结果，牛就喂得很肥。为了解决牛草的困难，有些地方发现了一种野生的白草根是很好的饲草，就发动农民割这种草根喂牛。与县下会村提出喂盐办法，即每日在牛料中加入食盐五钱或二两，能使牛劲大，并肯吃草。
