Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 14th. A certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a campaign to create model companies before last winter's offensive. According to the recent summary and evaluation results, a total of three companies were awarded the title of model company. The Second Artillery Company of a certain regiment was awarded the glorious title of "People's Army Model." During the campaign to clear the outskirts of Zhangwu, the company destroyed enemy fortifications with accurate shooting, eliminated two enemy heavy machine gun positions, cleared obstacles for the infantry's advance, and completed the combat mission. During the general attack, the company joined the battle with the infantry. Because the ground was frozen and artillery fortifications could not be built, they braved the enemy's dense artillery fire and bombarded the enemy's bunker in the heart of the Shizijie (crossroads) area. The cannon body vibrated, making it difficult to aim. Soldiers climbed onto the cannon to reduce the vibration. Even if they were shaken unconscious or fell off, they climbed back up. In successive battles, the company consistently demonstrated a heroic and tenacious combat style. The Seventh Company of a certain regiment was awarded "Combining Wisdom and Courage to Establish Extraordinary Achievements." In the battle of Zhangwu, the company was the main force in the assault on the Suokou (throat) area, wiping out 196 enemies and seizing 49 rifles, 5 submachine guns, 9 light and heavy machine guns, 4 60mm mortars, and 2 mortars, and an anti-tank gun. At the beginning of the battle, the company's main task was to blow up fortifications, but when the battle reached the city, the third platoon leader saw that the enemy's fortifications had been breached. He led the eighth squad into the city, using large scissors and pliers to fight the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, picking up the enemy's bombs, striking the enemy, occupying five deep enemy bunkers, and repelling two enemy counterattacks. Many soldiers continued to fight despite being wounded, until the victory was achieved. Another company has always paid attention to class education and ideological education, constantly improving the political consciousness of the soldiers, and the cadres are also very concerned about the lives of the soldiers, often personally cooking and boiling water for the soldiers after marching and camping. During the winter offensive, the company was supplemented by many liberated soldiers. The veteran soldiers of the company automatically took out more than one hundred pieces of clothing to solve the various difficulties in the lives of the liberated soldiers. The whole company was filled with an atmosphere of unity and fraternity. In the nine months from last summer's offensive to the winter offensive, no one deserted from the company. In addition to being awarded a brocade banner, each member of the model company's company headquarters was also awarded a set of shirts.

　　东北某部三个连
  　荣获模范连队称号
    【新华社东北十四日电】东北人民解放军某部，于去年冬季攻势前曾提出创造模范连队的号召，据最近总结评判结果，共有三个连荣获模范连队称号。某团炮二连获得“人民军队模范”的光荣称号，该连于肃清彰武外围战中，以准确射击摧毁敌人工事，打掉敌两处重机枪火力，给步兵扫除了前进障碍，完成了作战任务。总攻时该连随步兵加入卷战，因地冻不能做炮兵工事，即冒敌稠密炮火，向敌十字街心地堡轰击，炮身震动不易瞄准，战士爬在炮身上以减少震动，虽被震昏或震下来，仍然又爬上去。在历次战斗中，该连始终表现了英勇顽强的战斗作风。某团第七连被奖为“智勇结合建立奇功”，该连在彰武战斗中系突击索口的主力，歼敌一百九十六名，缴步枪四十九支，冲锋式五支，轻重机枪九挺，六零炮四门，迫击炮两门，战防炮一门。战斗开始，该连主要任务本为爆破，但战斗城下时，三排排长见敌工事已破，即率领八班冲入城内，以大剪刀钳子等与敌肉搏，捡起敌人的炸弹，打击敌人，占领敌纵深地堡五座，打退敌人两次反冲锋，许多战士虽负伤仍坚持作战，直至胜利结束。另一个连队经常能注意阶级教育与思想教育，不断提高战士们政治觉悟，干部对战士生活也非常关心，在行军宿营后常常亲自给战士煮饭烧水。冬季攻势中该连补充了许多解放战士，该连老战士即自动拿出百余件衣物，解决了解放战士的各种生活上的困难，全连充满团结友爱的空气。从去年夏季攻势至冬季攻势的九个月中，该连无一逃亡。荣获模范连队之各连连部，除各奖给锦旗一面外，每人并奖给衬衣一套。
