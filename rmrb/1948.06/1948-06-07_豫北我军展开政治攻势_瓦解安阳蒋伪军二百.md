　　Our Army in Northern Henan Launches Political Offensive
  　Disintegrates 200 Chiang Kai-shek Puppet Troops in Anyang
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the victorious offensive situation of our army, the Chiang Kai-shek die-hard bandit troops trapped in the isolated city of Anyang are in a state of constant panic. Many soldiers and junior officers are seeking ways to escape the isolated city of Anyang. Two folk rhymes are currently circulating around Anyang: "Entering the 'Fu,' you die miserably. Entering the 'Zhai,' you die quickly." ('Fu' and 'Zhai' both refer to Anyang). However, they do not fully understand our policies and have some doubts, preventing them from coming out. Since the southward transfer of a regiment of the 40th Division stationed in Anyang, the city has become even more panicked. Our Kunlun Mountain troops, in coordination with the Taihang Fifth Special Prefecture and the Party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels in Zhangnan, Ye County, and Tangdong County, seized this opportunity to launch a political offensive against Anyang. Cadres were dispatched to various villages to publicize the lenient policies of our Party and our army, to mobilize the masses to launch an offensive against the enemy, to hold forums for puppet family members, to explain and educate them, and to clarify the policies of our Party and our army: those who return will not be killed and will be allocated a share of land; those who return with weapons will be paid according to their value; and those who make special contributions will be rewarded. After such extensive publicity and explanation, the puppet family members and the masses understood the policies. After hearing this, one old lady insisted on kowtowing to the working comrade, saying, "This is great, we can finally be reunited!" The masses said, "The Communist Party sees far ahead, who wouldn't agree?" Puppet family members went to Anyang to call for their sons and husbands. From April 8th to 25th, within half a month, in the villages of the three districts of Ye County, Zhangnan, and Tangyin alone, 183 Chiang Kai-shek die-hard soldiers were disintegrated and returned home under our political offensive, along with 29 landlords and 6 middle-class peasant households who had been deceived into fleeing (not counting many who returned but had not yet registered with the government). After this offensive, people in Anyang city were saying that things were looking up, and the soldiers were trying to find opportunities to escape. Some, who were unable to escape due to the surveillance of Chiang Kai-shek's agents and officers, were hoping that the Liberation Army could liberate Anyang soon.
    [Another dispatch] The Kunlun Mountain troops, in coordination with the Taihang Fifth Special District and the Party, government, military, and civilian organizations of Ye, Zhang, and Tangdong counties, convened a work conference on the political offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek die-hard bandit troops in Anyang to study the issue of continuing the political offensive against Anyang. First, Section Chief Ni of the Liaison Department of the troops conveyed the working spirit of the Central Bureau and the Military Region, pointed out the past excessive left-leaning tendencies in the implementation of policies, and clarified the future policies for enemy work. Subsequently, Deputy Commander Shi spoke, first pointing out: The past overly left actions in the implementation of policies towards prisoners of war have caused some Chiang Kai-shek die-hard soldiers to be afraid, creating a red-white area opposition phenomenon. If this is not corrected, it will inevitably increase the difficulty in eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Anyang in the future. In the future, we must correctly implement policies, launch a continuous political offensive against Anyang, and disintegrate the Chiang Kai-shek die-hard bandit troops on a large scale.
    The meeting also studied various issues concerning the work. In the future, in order to facilitate the development of political offensives, a Political Offensive Working Committee for Anyang will be organized to specifically lead the political offensive affairs against the Chiang Kai-shek die-hard bandit troops in Anyang. At present, the Working Committee has cooperated with cadres from various counties and some comrades from the troops to go to work in the villages of Zhangnan, Ye County, and Tangdong. (Du Ming)

　　豫北我军展开政治攻势
  　瓦解安阳蒋伪军二百
    【本报消息】在我军胜利的进攻形势下，困守在安阳孤城的蒋顽匪军终日惶恐不安，许多士兵和下级军官都纷纷想出路，逃出安阳孤城。现安阳城周围流传着两句民谣：“进了府，死的苦。进了砦，死的快”（府）、砦，均指安阳）。但对我政策不大了解，有些疑惧，不敢出来。自驻安阳城之四十师一个团南调后，城内更加惶恐万状。我昆仑山部协伺太行五专署及漳南、邺县和汤东等县各级党政民武团体，抓紧这一机会，展开对安阳的政治攻势，分派干部到各村宣传我党我军宽大政策，发动群众性的对敌攻势，召开伪属座谈会，进行解释教育，说明我党我军政策；来归者不杀，分给一份土地；携枪来归者，按价给钱；如有特殊供献者受奖。经过这样广泛宣传解释后，伪属和群众都了解政策。一个老太太听说后，非要给那个工作同志磕头不行，她说：“这可中了，俺可得团圆啦！”群众们说：“还是共产党看的远，谁不赞成呢？”伪属纷纷自动到安阳去叫子索夫，从四月八日到二十五日半月中，仅邺县漳南和汤阴三个区的村庄在我政治攻势下，瓦解回乡的蒋顽匪军士兵就有一百八十三名，被骗逃亡的地主二十九户，中农六户（还有许多回来后尚未向政府登记的不计在内）。经过这次攻势，安阳城里的人都传说这可好了，士兵们都想找机跑出来，有的在蒋特和军官监视下跑不出来的，都盼着解放军能早日打安阳解放他们。
    【又讯】昆仑山部协同太行五专区及邺、漳、汤东县党政民武团体，召开对安阳蒋顽匪军政治攻势工作会议，研究再次连续对安阳的政治攻势问题，首先部队联络部倪科长传达中央局大军区的工作精神，指出过去在执行政策上的过左偏向，和阐明今后的对敌工作政策。继由石副司令讲话，他首先指出：过去执行对俘虏政策的过左行动，致使有些蒋顽匪军士兵害怕，造成赤白区对立现象，如不加以纠正，对今后消灭安阳蒋匪军势必增加困难。今后要正确的执行政策，对安阳展开连续的政治攻势，大量瓦解蒋顽匪军。
    会议并研究了关于工作各种问题，今后为了便利开展政攻，特组织对安阳政治攻势工委会，专门领导对安阳蒋顽匪军政攻事宜。现在工委会已协同各县干部及部队一部分同志分赴漳南、邺县、汤东各村工作。（杜明）
