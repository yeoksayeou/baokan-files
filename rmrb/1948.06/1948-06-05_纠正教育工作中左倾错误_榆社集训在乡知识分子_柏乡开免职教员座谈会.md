　　Correcting Leftist Errors in Educational Work
　　Yushe Trains Intellectuals in the Countryside
　　Baixiang Holds Symposium for Dismissed Teachers
　　[Yushe News] During the Three Check-ups in Yushe last year, the majority of intellectual teachers were purged blindly based on their class background and past so-called "political issues." Recently, in accordance with the Party's policy, the Yushe leadership reviewed the past deviations and decided to adopt the principle of unity and transformation, training intellectuals in the countryside in stages. The first phase has now begun, with a total of 38 participants: six normal school students, eleven middle school students, one vocational school student, one administrative cadre school student, and nineteen higher primary school students. Among them, 24 have served as principals and teachers in higher and lower primary schools, three in theatrical troupes, one student, and ten cadres. Most of them have ten years of work history.
　　At the beginning, most people did not believe in the Party's policy, thinking that they would be brought forward when needed and pushed back when not needed. Cheng Yuxian said: "We were very active as teachers and principals, but in the end, we were squeezed out." Lu Ruilan said: "We are not landlords or rich peasants. Our education basically improved after the Communist Party came, and we worked hard, but we were squeezed back home." Most people were satisfied with this study, but were concerned about whether there would be actions like the Three Check-ups last year in the future. Discovering these thoughts, the leadership organized the study of Comrade Ren Bishi's report and the decision of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CCP on intellectuals. After research and discussion, the doubts and concerns of most people were resolved. Zhang Guoqing said: "In the past, as soon as an instruction or call was published in the newspaper, the lower levels would act. This time, the person in charge of the CCP published an article. I believe in the policy toward intellectuals." Li Yuwen said: "In the past, although they said they would unite with intellectuals, there was no explicit provision. The Outline Land Law and the above two articles, and the leadership's review this time, have made me put down the ideological burden. In the future, intellectuals will have security." Liang Shijun said: "The policy is definitely going to be implemented. For example, since the policy of stopping beatings was promulgated, beatings have not been heard of in various places. This proves that the policy toward intellectuals will also be implemented." Lu Ruilan said: "I understand now: although our class background is good, we have errors and shortcomings, and were even mistaken for special agents, so we were squeezed out. Besides, during the high tide of the movement, like a flood, it is inevitable to involve one or two families." Zhang Zide said: "The policy is correct. In the past, we tried to use the revolution to develop ourselves and did not serve the people. We also have problems, and we must check them carefully and not simply blame the leadership. In the future, the Communist Party will unite intellectuals to jointly build a new China. We must work hard to transform ourselves and take on tasks."
　　After three days of reviewing past deviations and studying the new policy, everyone put down their ideological burdens and are now deeply examining and discussing how to transform themselves into new democratic education workers. After the end, they will go to higher and lower primary schools to serve as teachers. (Cui Tianshen, Wu Jian)
　　[Baixiang News] The Baixiang County Government convened a symposium for dismissed teachers on May 25th. More than 50 people attended. County Head Zhang Yuqiu personally led the meeting, studied the policy toward intellectuals, reviewed the past implementation of this policy, studied how to correct leftist adventurist errors, and resolved several ideological problems of the teachers present. (1) Not thorough. They believed that this reinstatement would not last long, and after the on-the-job teachers returned from training, they would still have to "step down." (2) Class background issue: They believed that their class background was not good, and nothing could be done, so they would teach for a while and then leave. (3) They believed that they would have to step down during the land reform in the autumn. After discussion and research at the meeting, it was understood that the policy was always correct, but there were deviations in implementation, swinging from left to right, causing confusion in everyone's thinking and emotions. This time, everyone understood that "as long as you serve the people well and work actively, you will not be purged"; "a bad class background can also make progress, and a good class background must also work hard," and the concerns in their minds were removed.

　　纠正教育工作中左倾错误
    榆社集训在乡知识分子
  　柏乡开免职教员座谈会
    【榆社消息】榆社去年三查时，盲目的根据成份与过去所谓有“政治问题”，将知识分子教员大部清洗出去。最近依据党的政策，榆社领导上检讨了过去的偏向，决定本团结改造方针，分期集训在乡知识分子。现在第一期已开始，参加的计有师范生六名，中学生十一名，职业学校一名，行政干校一名，高小十九名，共三十八人。其中担任过高初校长教员的二十四人，剧团三人，学生一人，干部十人。他们大部有十来年的工作历史。
    开始时，大部分人不相信党的政策。认为用着了拉前，用不着了推后。程玉先说：“咱当教员，当校长，很积极的干，结果挤了咱。”鹿瑞兰说：“咱不是地主富农，咱的文化基本上是在共产党来了以后才提高的，工作也努力，可是把咱挤回了家。”大部分人对这次学习很满意，但疑虑今后是否还有象去年三查时的行动。发现了这些思想，即领导学习了任弼时同志的报告及中共东北中央局对知识分子的决定。经过研究讨论，解决了大部分人的怀疑与顾虑。张国青说：“根据过去，报纸上一发表指示号召，下边就动起来了；这次中共负责人发表文章，对知识分子的政策我是相信的。”李玉文说：“过去对知识分子虽说团结，但没有明文规定，土地法大纲及以上两篇文章，和领导上这次作了检讨，我现在放下了思想上的包袱，今后知识分子有了保障。”梁时俊说：“政策是肯定的要执行。比如自从颁布了停止打人政策以后，各地打人就听不见了。证明对知识分子政策也同样要执行。”鹿瑞兰说：“我思想通了：咱成份虽好，可是本身有错误缺点，反成过特务，因而挤了咱；再说运动高潮时，象大水一样，免不了捎带一两家。”张自德说：“政策是对的，过去咱企图利用革命发展自己，没为人民服务；本身有毛病，也要好好检查，不能单纯埋怨领导，今后共产党要团结知识分子，共同建设新中国；咱要努力改造自己，担负任务。”
    经过三天检查过去的偏向和学习新政策，大家放下了思想包袱，现正深入检查与讨论如何改造自己，使成为新民主主义教育工作者。结束后即分别到高初小校任教员。（崔天申、武剑）
    【柏乡消息】柏乡县府在五月廿五号召集免职教员座谈会。到会五十多人。县长张雨秋亲自领导，研究了对知识分子的政策，并对过去执行这一政策做了检查，对如何纠正左倾冒险主义错误做了研究，解决了到会教员思想上的几个问题。（一）不蹬底。认为这次复职时间也不能很久，等在职教员受训回来后，自己仍要“下台”。（二）成份问题：认为自己成份不好，怎么也不行，教一段再说。（三）认为秋后土改时还得下台。会上经过讨论研究，知道了政策是始终正确的；只是执行上出了偏差，左右摇摆，造成大家思想情绪上混乱。这次大家明白了“只要好好为人民服务，工作积极，就不会被清洗”；“成份不好也能进步，成份好的也得努力，”思想上去掉了顾虑。（朱星三）
