Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army, in conjunction with the people's armed forces of the Huanglong Sub-district, actively struck against northward-invading Hu bandits, protecting the wheat harvest of the masses in the area. Beginning May 25th, the Hu bandits' entire 17th Division and 38th Division, etc., colluded with local Chiang armed forces, and launched a large-scale incursion from Pucheng towards Chengcheng and Heyang in the southern Huanglong Sub-district. After our army took the initiative to withdraw from the cities of Cheng and Heyang on the 26th, on the 28th, we struck at the bandits who were raiding in separate groups in Guojiazhuang, Luojia'ao north of Chengcheng, and the northern and southern Cai villages and Beiyongning on the outskirts of Heyang, inflicting casualties on some of them. On the morning of the 30th, a unit of our army launched an annihilating strike against the local Chiang Han (cheng) Heyang security police brigade, self-defense brigade, and commando detachment that had invaded Baijian Town (between Hancheng and Heyang) from Fangzhen (east of Heyang), capturing 140 enemy personnel including the puppet commander Gao Yangyun and Ma Chenglong, and seizing one light machine gun and 124 rifles and short guns. The remnants of the enemy fled in disarray.
