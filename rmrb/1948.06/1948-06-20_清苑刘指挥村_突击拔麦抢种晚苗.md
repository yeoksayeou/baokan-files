　　【Jizhong News】Liu Zhuihui Village, Qingyuan Seventh District, which is close to the border area, is actively rushing to harvest wheat and plant late fields. In five days, it completed the pulling of wheat and sowing on 2,924 mu. The village has more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields, accounting for three-fifths of the total land. This year, 2,924 mu of barley and wheat were planted, exceeding the number of wheat planted in any previous year. Since the proposal to vigorously plant late seedlings, the village's New Farmers' Association has studied how to cultivate or assist in cultivating land for impoverished military families with no labor force, as well as work attendance methods, and proposed to ensure that no land is left barren and that planting is not delayed. On June 7th, there was a soaking rain, and the farmers happily said, "This rain is really good, this year is really a year of liberation." Some said, "Quickly pull up the wheat and plant late seedlings, the earlier you plant, the earlier it will mature." So everyone started pulling up the wheat, pulling one piece and sowing one piece. In the morning, they pulled wheat, at noon they harrowed the land, and in the afternoon they sowed. In five days, the pulling of wheat and sowing on 2,924 mu has been completed. During the pulling of wheat and cultivation, the farmers also promoted mutual aid and exchange of labor, stipulating that whoever's crop matures first will have theirs pulled first, and after it is completed, labor will be cleared according to the number of mu. Farmer Liu Laoxian not only finished his own work, but also did it for those without labor. Ten primary school students who were on vacation also organized a shock team to pull wheat and sow seeds. In the morning, they pulled wheat for their families, and in the afternoon, they organized teams to pull wheat and sow seeds for military dependents, orphans, widows, and the poor, pulling more than 20 mu in four days. The village is close to the border area and is now actively rushing to quickly fight and quickly hide to prevent enemy looting.

　　清苑刘指挥村
  　突击拔麦抢种晚苗
    【冀中讯】清苑七区接近边缘区刘指挥村，积极突击麦收，播种晚田，五天中完成了二千九百二十四亩的拔麦、播种。该村有水地三千多亩，占总地数五分之三。今年种大麦、小麦二千九百二十四亩，种麦数超过已往任何一年。自从提出大力播种晚苗后，该村新农会便研究如何给贫苦无劳动力的军属代耕或助耕，以及出勤办法，并提出保证不荒一片地，不耽误播种。六月七日下了透雨，农民们喜欢的说：“这场雨真好，今年真是翻身年。”有的说：“快拔麦子种上晚苗，早种一天就早熟一天。”于是大家便开始拔麦，拔一块耩一块，早晨拔麦子，晌午耙地，下午就耩上了。在五天中，已完成二千九百二十四亩的拔麦和播种。在拔麦和耕耩时，农民们还发扬了互助拨工，规定了谁家的先熟就先拔谁的，作完后再按亩数齐工清工。农民刘老贤除把自己的活做完外，还给无劳动力的做。放假回来的十个高小学生，也组织了一个拔麦播种突击队，上午给家里拔麦子，下午即整队给无劳动力的军属孤寡贫民拔麦播种，在四天中拔麦二十多亩。该村接近边沿区，现正积极突击快打、快藏，以防敌人抢掠。
