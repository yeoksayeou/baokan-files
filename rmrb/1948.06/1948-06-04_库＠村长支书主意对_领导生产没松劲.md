【Ping Shun News】The cadres of Ku@ Village in the Sixth District of Ping Shun, upon hearing about the Land Law Outline and the Democratic Party Rectification, did not become idle. They felt that as long as they were not corrupt, did not act as local bullies, and did not do anything illegal, and that they discussed matters with the masses, everything was for the sake of work, and even if there were some shortcomings, they were not afraid. Their leadership work has been consistently active from beginning to end. Only a few cadres had thoughts of stepping down, but under the influence of good comrades, they also started working again.

On the second day of the first lunar month, a mass meeting was held to resolve issues such as the "three-way combination" and women's labor-capital cooperation in last year's mutual aid efforts, and to reorganize the mutual aid groups. Out of the 221 households in the village, based on the foundation of the old mutual aid groups, eight teams consisting of seventeen groups were formed through democratic and voluntary combination. Three teams continued to engage in the "three-way combination," while five teams focused solely on agricultural mutual aid. Among the eighteen women's groups, five were still willing to engage in labor-capital cooperation, collectively planting cotton and distributing profits from spinning and weaving. Thirteen groups were engaged in mutual aid spinning and weaving, and they all had short-term plans. Cadres regularly monitored, reported, and inspected progress, helping to solve difficulties. After completing the sowing plan, each team aimed to earn 25,000 yuan from sideline occupations, and as a result, the twenty-day plan was completed in eighteen days. Out of the village's total of more than 1,392 mu of land, except for eighteen laborers who went for transportation and eleven who were sick, all participated in the sowing campaign. To overcome the spring famine, various spring vegetables were planted, covering 69 mu of land, and 23,244 melon seedlings were planted. One hundred and sixty-four women, in twenty days, in addition to working in the fields, spun 364 jin of cotton and wove 1,850 chi of cloth. The village head and political director, among others, then convened the Spring Committee and discussed with representatives of the masses what to do after sowing. Each group then formulated a half-month plan, extracting fifty-eight full laborers and twelve livestock to engage in transportation and busy work, and all have now gone out. The rest at home are processing pepper strips, reclaiming wasteland, and planting turnips, etc. The women plan to spin 250 jin of cotton in this half-month, in addition to raising silkworms, and this is currently being implemented.

　　库＠村长支书主意对
  　领导生产没松劲
    【平顺消息】平顺六区库＠村的干部，听到土地法大纲和民主整党，并没躺倒，他们觉得不贪污、不恶霸、不做犯法事，有事和群众商量，都是为了工作，有点毛病也不怕，领导工作从头到尾一直是积极的。只有个别干部存在下台思想，但在好的同志影响下也起来工作了。
    阴历正月初二日，就召开群众大会，解决去年互助当中的三大结合和妇女的劳资合作等问题，从新整顿互助组。全村二百二十一户，在旧互助组的根基上，民主自愿结合了八大队十七个组，三个队仍然是三大结合的搞，五个队只是农业互助。妇女十八个组，有五个组还愿意劳资合作，集体入棉，纺织分红。有十三组是互助纺织，他们都订有短期计划。干部经常掌握汇报检查，帮助解决困难。计划完成下种后，每队搞副业要赚到两万五千元，结果是二十天的计划十八天就全部完成了。全村共地一千三百九十二亩多，除了十八个劳力去运输和十一个病号外，全部参加下种运动。为渡过春荒，多种春菜共栽地蔓六十九亩，栽南瓜二万三千二百四十四窑；一百六十四个妇女，二十天除上地外，还纺花三百六十四斤，织布一千八百五十尺。村长和政治主任等，就又召开了春委会，和群众代表研究下完种再搞什么，各组又订了半个月计划，抽出五十八个全劳力，牲口十二头，搞运输打忙工，现在全数出去了。其余在家盘椒条、开荒、栽蔓菁等，妇女计划在这半个月中，除了喂蚕，结合纺花二百五十斤，现在正实行中。
