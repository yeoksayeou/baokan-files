　　Guan County Launches Massive Project
  　Ten Days to Dig Fifty Li of Canals
    [Jinan News] Guan County launched a general mobilization to dig canals, completing two canals in ten days. Thanks to effective mobilization that resolved various ideological concerns among the masses, coupled with the personal leadership of county and district cadres in promptly addressing issues, and the exemplary role of village cadres and Party members, the task was completed ahead of schedule, starting on the 10th of last month and finishing in less than ten days. The Hongyan Canal was originally planned to be dug by 5,000 people in seven days, but due to good mobilization, over 7,600 people participated, completing the task in five days. The Guantang Canal was originally planned to be dug by 14,000 people in seven days, but as a result, 19,620 people participated, completing the task in five days. The Sixth District completed the work in less than three days, as each village in the district launched challenge competitions, with river workers and village cadres taking the lead. After water was struck, cadres were the first to get into the water to dig themselves. The masses started work before dawn and worked late into the night. The Xu Xin Village completed the digging in one day and two shifts. The two canals totaled 8,256 zhang, equivalent to 51 li, with a river mouth width of 3 zhang 1 chi 5 cun, a river bottom width of 1 zhang, a river bank of 3 chi, and a river embankment width of 1 zhang 8 chi. A total of 26,893 people were mobilized, with an additional 2,041 people for auxiliary work (cooks, doctors, etc.). The project, originally planned for fourteen days, was completed in less than ten days. (Shen Yaojiang)

　　冠县三万人大动工
  　十天挖渠五十里
    【冀南消息】冠县总动员挖渠，十天挖完两道。由于打通了群众的各种思想，又加上县区干部的亲自领导及时解决问题和村干、党员的带头作用，从上月十日开始动员，不到十天提早完成了任务。红眼渠原计划动员五千人七天挖完，由于动员的好，去了七千六百多人，五天即完成了任务。冠堂渠原计划动员一万四千人七天挖完，结果去了一万九千六百二十人，五天完成任务。六区不到三天就完成，因该区各村都掀起了挑战竞赛，河工、村干起带头作用，挖出水后，干部首先自己下到水里挖。群众都是起五更睡半夜，徐辛村一天零两晌就挖完。两道渠共八千二百五十六丈，合五十一华里，河口宽三丈一尺五寸，河底一丈宽，河唇三尺，河堤一丈八尺宽，共动员了两万六千八百九十三人，另零工（火夫医生等）二千零四十一人。原计划十四天的工程，不到十天即完成了。（申耀江）
