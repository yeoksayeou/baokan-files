　　[News from Ji-Lu-Yu] Since Liaocheng rectified its policies, all businesses have been operating with peace of mind, and the market has gradually prospered. According to a recent survey, 24 new businesses were added in the six days from May 19th to May 25th. These include 14 established merchants, such as Tongxing Tobacco Shop (capital of 5 million yuan), Yutaichang Company (capital of 5 million yuan), Yijuhe Company (capital of 8 million yuan), Dadong Freight Station (capital of 10 million yuan), Gongyi Paper Mill, and Shehua Clothing Bureau (capital of 4 million yuan). In addition, there are 10 peddlers such as Jiao Yutian (capital of 60,000 yuan), Fu Guozhen (capital of 50,000 yuan), and Jin Changyou (capital of 150,000 yuan). Before March, the city had a total of 1,171 merchants and established stores. From March to May 19th, 52 were added, and 24 were added in the six days from May 19th to May 25th. Others, such as Wuhe Oil Shop, are actively preparing to open for business. Wang Jinshan, a merchant who fled after being struggled against, and Sun Fucheng, a handicraft worker, and five others have returned from Jinan one after another. The district government summoned them for discussions, discussed restitution methods, and provided interest-free and low-interest loans to help them resume business.
