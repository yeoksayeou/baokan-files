Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th. A textile factory in Central China began implementing product standardization in April. After establishing a performance evaluation system, significant results have been achieved. The factory has set various standards for its products. For example, fabrics are classified as excellent if they are fine, dense, even, of uniform thickness; towels are classified as excellent if the nap, weight, length, and size are uniform; warp yarns are classified as first-class if no loops are dropped or repeated. To ensure the correct implementation of these standards, a performance evaluation system was established, including: (1) Each department's receiving and dispatch personnel establish a product inspection ledger, inspecting each product daily, evaluating its grade according to the standards, and recording it. (2) If the manufacturer disagrees, the trade union's production committee or production officer can re-evaluate. (3) The engineering department, based on the registration materials from each department, compiles statistics on output and quality, publishes the progress of each department every half month, and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each department's work monthly, classifying them by quality and publishing the results. (4) In addition to departmental inspections, other departments can also inspect each other. After the implementation of this method, it immediately sparked a factory-wide competition. Workers pre-evaluate their products themselves or inspect each other before handing them over to the receiving and dispatch personnel for registration. Wang Bucai, a weaver in the towel department, saw on the registration board that he was rated as average, while some trainees were rated as first-class. He blushed, left without a word, and after four days of effort, he jumped to excellent. From May 1st to 5th, excellent and first-class products in the towel department accounted for 18.4 percent, and from the 6th to the 10th, excellent and first-class products surged to 55 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th. Liu Tongxuan, an employee of the "Dahua" Match Factory here, recently discovered a type of stone that can replace imported sharpening stones, making a significant contribution to industrial production. The blades installed on the cutting machines of the match factory previously required Japanese-made sharpening stones (sandstone) for grinding. These sharpening stones were expensive, costing several million North Sea currency units per piece, and difficult to obtain. To overcome this difficulty, Liu Tongxuan searched for similar stones for several days, crossing mountains and ridges. After proving the usability of some stones, he brought them back for testing and finally discovered a completely suitable stone. The East China Financial and Economic Office has issued a certificate of merit and a bonus to Liu Tongxuan for this discovery, and called on factory employees to learn from Liu's spirit of innovation. According to a spokesman for the office, this discovery not only solves the needs of the Dahua Match Factory but can also be supplied to factories in various liberated areas. If there is a need in various places, simply specify the dimensions and thickness, and send a letter directly to the Production Department of the East China Financial and Economic Office for contact.

　　华中某纺织工厂实行产品标准化
  　华东发现磨刀摇石代用石
    【新华社华东四日电】华中某纺织厂于四月份开始实行产品标准化，建立考工制度后，已获显著成效。该厂对产品订出了各种标准，如布匹则以细密平匀稀厚一律者，毛巾则以毛头分量长短尺寸一律者，均列为特等；经纱以不掉一扣眼，不重一扣眼者为上等。为保证正确执行此标准，又订出考工制度，如：（一）各间收发订立产品考查簿，每日将产品逐一检查，按标准评判等级，进行登记。（二）制造人不同意，可由职工会生产委员会或生产干事复评。（三）工务部按各间登记材料，统计产量质量，将各间升降动态半月公布一次，每月总结各间工作优缺点，按质量分等，并将其公布。（四）除本间检查外，其他各间亦可互相检查。此一办法实行后，立即掀起全厂竞赛热潮，工人下工时都把产品先经自己预评或相互检阅，然后才交各间收发登记。毛巾间织师王步才在登记牌上看到他是中等，而有些练习生倒是上等，红着脸一声不响走开了，经过四天努力，便一跃而为特等。毛巾间五月一日至五日，特等和上等的产品占百分之十八点四，六日至十日特等上等产品便激增至百分之五十五。
    【新华社华东四日电】此间“大华”火柴厂职员刘桐轩，近发现石头一种，可代替外来磨刀摇石，对工业生产贡献甚大。该火柴厂切杆机所装刀片，过去需日本造的摇石（沙质）来磨，这种摇石价格昂贵，每块现需北海币数百万元，且不容易买到。刘桐轩为克服此一困难，几日翻山越岭，搜集类似石块，证明可用者携回试验，终于发现一种完全合用的石头。对刘桐轩此一发现，华东财经办事处已发予奖状及奖金，并号召各厂职工学习刘的创造精神。据该处发言人称：这个发现，不仅解决了大华火柴厂的需要，且可供给各解放区工厂的使用，各地如有需要者，只要说明尺寸厚薄，径函华东财经办事处生产部接洽即可。
