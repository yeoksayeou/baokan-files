Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Helsinki: Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala announced to the masses on the 3rd, at a rally organized by the Finnish-Soviet Friendship Association to celebrate the exchange of ratification documents for the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union, that the Soviet Union had decided to reduce the unpaid portion of Finland's war reparations by 50% starting July 1st. The Soviet Union also agreed to grant Finland a loan of 5 million US dollars on very favorable terms. The announcement of these two pieces of news sparked a storm of cheers throughout the venue. As early as May 19th, Finnish cabinet ministers Laine (who had not yet left office at the time), Jäntti, and Murto, all from the Communist Party, jointly sent a letter to the Finnish government, requesting that the government consult with the Soviet government to reduce Finland's reparations to the Soviet Union in order to alleviate the economic difficulties caused by the drop in the price of goods exported to the United Kingdom. This suggestion had been approved by the Finnish government. When discussing future elections, Pekkala criticized the undesirable phenomena that occurred during the campaign, such as the Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian Party opposing their three-party cooperation agreement with the People's Democratic League, which is the true program of all Finnish people and remains important to this day. Finnish-Soviet Friendship Association Chairman Kilpi said that since the end of the war, the day the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty was ratified was the greatest holiday for the Finnish people. Kilpi, on behalf of the association, thanked Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people for their friendly attitude. The meeting ended with sustained cheers. In order to quickly spread the above news, Finnish newspapers published extra editions one after another, and people in various places were extremely happy upon hearing the news.

　　苏联减少芬兰赔款
  　芬兰欢庆两国互助条约
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬总理皮可拉于三日在芬苏友好协会组织的庆祝苏芬友好合作互助条约交换批准书大会上，向群众宣布苏联决定自七月一日起，减少芬兰战争赔偿未支付部分百分之五十，苏联并允在很有利的条件下，贷与芬兰五百万美元。这两个消息的宣布，激起了全场暴风雨似的欢呼。早在上月十九日，芬兰内阁三共产党部长莱诺（其时尚未去职），詹体宁、穆特即曾联名致函芬政府，要求政府商请苏联政府减少芬兰对苏赔偿，以减轻因对英国出口货物跌价而造成的经济困难。这一建议已获得芬政府通过。讨论及未来大选问题时，皮可拉指责竞选中发生的不良现象，例如社会民主党与农民党反对他们与人民民主联盟的三党合作协定，而这一协定是全体芬兰人民的真正纲领，这个纲领至今仍属重要。芬苏友好协会主席基尔皮演说称：自从战争结束以来，批准苏芬互助条约这一天，是芬兰人民最伟大的节日。基氏代表协会向斯大林元帅与苏联人民的友好态度致谢。会议在经久不息的欢呼声中结束。为了迅速传播上述消息，芬兰各报且纷纷刊出号外，各地人民闻讯后，均极欢欣。
