Selling China's Inland Waterway Rights
　　Chiang and the US Complete Preliminary Agreement
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] According to American news agency reports: Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government has completed a preliminary agreement with the United States to completely sell out China's inland waterway navigation rights. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 18th stated: "Government officials confirmed: Disregarding the opposition of China's shipping industry, a preliminary agreement has been reached to allow American ships to transport relief supplies into the Yangtze River and other inland waterways of China." A United Press dispatch on the 21st even quoted the remarks of "a certain Chinese official" confirming that the measures for American ships to navigate China's inland waterways have long been implemented. The "official" admitted: "American ships currently en route to China carrying aid supplies have been allowed to sail up the Yangtze River and anchor in ports outside of Shanghai. Moreover, these ships are not the first batch; in the past few months, American ships have sailed on the Yangtze River on several occasions." According to reports in the Chiang-controlled press in mid-February of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek government had decided to sell out inland waterway navigation rights as one of the conditions for obtaining American aid. Chiang's official spokesman, Dong Xian Guang, also admitted in a speech on February 18th: "The government, when necessary, can freely open any coastal and inland river ports to foreign ships for loading and unloading export or import goods."

　　出卖中国内河航权
  　蒋美完成初步协定
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据美国通讯社消息：蒋介石卖国政府已与美国完成全面出卖中国内河航行权的初步协议。美联社南京十八日电称：“政府官员证实：不顾中国航业界之反对，允许美国船只载运救济物资进入长江及中国其他内河的初步协议，业已作成”。合众社廿一日电更引证“某中国官方人士”的谈话证实美国船只航行中国内河办法早已在实行中，该“官方人士”承认：“刻正载运援助物资在来华途中的美国船只，已被允许上溯长江并碇泊于上海以外的港口。而这样的船只已不是第一批，过去数月中，美国船只曾在好几个场合下行走于长江”。按今年二月中旬蒋区报界即已盛传蒋介石政府决定将内河航行权的出卖，作为取得美国援助的交换条件之一。蒋官方发方人董显光二月十八日谈话中亦承认：“政府对于外籍船只装运输出或起卸输入货物，必要时可自由开放沿海及内河任何港口”。
