　　Work as Slowly as Possible!
　　Spanish People Oppose Franco
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] TASS reported: Red Star newspaper recently published an article reporting on the current situation in Spain, stating: "Work as slowly as possible" is a popular slogan among Spanish workers now. Farmers also resist the Franco regime by hiding agricultural products to avoid requisitions and evading exorbitant taxes. Under the fascist terror of Franco, although news of the arrest and massacre of democrats is heard daily, and despite the fact that thousands of people have been arrested in the first four months of this year, and hundreds of outstanding sons and daughters of the Spanish people have been sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment by the courts, none of this can suppress the anti-fascist movement in the country, which is expanding day by day. The people's anger and unease are constantly growing, sabotage activities in factories and mines are intensifying, and the guerrilla movement is expanding.

  　西班牙人民反对佛朗哥
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：红星报顷著文报导西班牙之现状称：“工作尽量慢点儿”这是现在西班牙工人中流行的口号。农民也用隐藏农产品不给征发和逃避苛捐杂税来抵抗佛朗哥政权。在佛朗哥法西斯的恐怖之下，虽然逮捕与屠杀民主人士的消息日有所闻，尽管今年头四个月中有数千人被捕，成百的西班牙人民优秀儿女遭法庭处死或长期监禁，但这都镇压不了国内的反法西斯运动在日益扩大。人民的愤怒和不安在不断地增长着，工厂与矿场中的破坏活动日益加紧，游击运动日益扩大。
