[Ji Lu Yu News] With the protection of the People's Liberation Army, the large-scale dike restoration project on the south bank of the Yellow River commenced on the 14th. The dike restoration projects in the counties of Juancheng, Yunbei, and Kunshan on the south bank had originally started according to plan before the wheat harvest. However, due to the harassment and sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops from the 5th, 75th, 55th, and 68th Divisions, the work was eventually forced to stop. Since our army moved south and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fled south of the Juhe Highway, our counties along the river have immediately seized the time to rush the dike restoration. The dike breaches in the sections of Juancheng, Yunbei, Kunshan, and Shouzhang counties require a total of more than 530,000 cubic meters of earth. Currently, more than 27,000 civilian laborers have been mobilized to work on the dikes. With each person moving two cubic meters of earth per day, the entire project can be completed by the end of June, leaving about ten days before the flood season.

[Ji Lu Yu News] After our army liberated Dongming, the Yellow River Committee immediately led its staff to rush to repair the three major dangerous projects on the south bank of the Yellow River. The dangerous projects in Gaocun, Nanhua Zhukou Liuzhuang in Dongming, and Jiangsu Dam in Juancheng, were repeatedly damaged when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied the area. The rapid currents constantly topped and scoured the foundations, resulting in extremely dangerous conditions for the dams and revetments at all three sites. If they cannot be fully repaired before the flood season, there is a risk of breaches during the flood season. The Yellow River Committee had prepared 1,200 cubic meters of stone, 1.8 million bundles of straw, and 300,000 jin of firewood in areas north of the river such as Puyang, Kunwu, and Hua County, planning to seize every opportunity to transport them to the south bank to rescue the three major dangerous projects. When our army recovered Dongming on the 16th, Wang Huayun, director of the Engineering Committee, rushed to the dam head overnight, leading the staff of the First Repair and Defense Department to cross the river and transport the materials. They worked day and night, determined to complete the urgent projects before the flood season to prevent the people from suffering from the Yellow River disaster.

[Ji Lu Yu News] In order to sabotage our Yellow River management projects, on the eve of this major flood season, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits constantly dispatched American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft to harass the river. From June 10th to 20th, the Sunkou dangerous project in Shouzhang County alone was bombed and strafed six times. On the morning of the 20th, two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft circled and strafed Sunkou, and dropped bombs. Several places where straw was stored for repairing the dams and revetments caught fire. More than a hundred people from Liuqiao and Daizhuang braved the strafing from Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft to rush to the rescue, and finally extinguished the fire, but the loss of straw reached 59,150 jin. At dawn on June 8th, six Chiang Kai-shek aircraft concentrated their bombing on Zhong Liqiao in the third district of Puyang County, dropping nine bombs, causing casualties to four innocent civilians. On the same day, the material transport ships sailing from the Huangdu dangerous project to the south bank were also attacked by Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. Fortunately, no one was injured. The aircraft then fled to Hongmiao in Kunshan County to strafe. At 6:00 a.m. on June 1st, two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft strafed the engineering team of our Dong'a Repair and Defense Section, who were repairing the stone dams of the Guokou and Huakou dangerous projects, forcing them to temporarily stop work. At 6:00 a.m. on May 13th, two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft attacked the Weishan ferry crossing in the Xuyi Section, bombing and killing two civilians and boatmen, and injuring more than 20 people. At 10:00 a.m. on the 14th, two bandit aircraft bombed Weishan again, destroying two houses.

　　人民解放军掩护治河
  　黄河南岸突击复堤
  　蒋机不断破坏治黄工程
    【冀鲁豫讯】黄河南岸大规模复堤工程，在人民解放军掩护下已于十四日开工。南岸鄄城、郓北、昆山等县复堤工程，原已于麦收前按照计划动工，后因蒋匪军整五、七五、五五、六八等师侵扰破坏，终于被迫停工。自我大军南下，蒋匪军窜往巨菏公路以南后，我沿河各县立即抓紧时间突击复堤。鄄城、郓北、昆山、寿张四个县段的堤口共需土五十三万余立方公尺，现已动员二万七千余民工上堤。以每人每天挑土二方计，六月底即可全部完工，距大汛期尚有十天左右。
    【冀鲁豫讯】我军解放东明后，黄委会立即率领员工抢修黄河南岸三大险工。东明高村、南华朱口刘庄，鄄城江苏坝等处险工，在蒋匪盘踞时屡遭破坏，大溜又不断顶冲掏刷，以至三处险状的坝埽险象横生，大汛前如不能全力修复，大汛期间即有决口之虞。我黄委会早于北岸濮县、昆吾、滑县等地筹备好一千二百方石料，一百八十万秸料，三十万斤柴枝，准备抓紧一切时机，运往南岸抢救三大险工。当我军十六日收复东明后，工委会主任王化云即星夜赶到坝头，率第一修防处员工渡河，并赶运工料，日夜加工，决于大汛前做好急要工程，以免人民遭受黄灾。
    【冀鲁豫讯】蒋匪为破坏我治黄工程，在此大汛前夕，不断派遣美造蒋机沿河袭扰，从六月十日至二十日，仅寿张孙口险工即被轰炸扫射六次。二十日上午，蒋机二架在孙口盘旋扫射，并投弹轰炸，修坝埽的秸料数处被炸起火，刘桥、戴庄百余群众冒蒋机扫射赶往抢救，始将火扑灭，损失秸料达五九一五○斤。六月八日拂晓，蒋机六架集中轰炸濮县三区中李桥，投弹九枚，无辜群众伤亡四人。同日由黄渡险工开往南岸的运料船只，也遭蒋机袭击，幸未伤人，该机旋又窜至昆山县红庙扫射。六月一日晨六时，蒋机二架扫射我东阿修防段工程队，他们正在抢修郭口和滑口险工的石坝，被迫暂时停工。五月十三日晨六时，蒋机二架袭击徐翼段魏山渡口，炸死群众、水手二人，伤二十余人，十四日上午十时匪机二架再炸魏山，毁房子两座。
