　　【Taiyue News】The political offensive launched by Pingyao County against the enemy in the second half of May has been very effective.

After they understood the Communist Party's policies, they came back one after another. Some who wanted work were introduced to jobs, and those who wanted to return home were given travel expenses. Those who brought back guns received bonuses. They said: "If we had known this earlier, we would have returned long ago." Some complained that they could only drink two meals of rice soup a day with Yan Xishan, and people were so hungry that their faces were yellow and thin.

　　平遥宣传政策开展政攻
  　顽伪人员纷纷反正
    【太岳讯】平遥县五月后半月对敌开展政治攻势，收效很大。有四十二名阎顽人员反正，二十一家逃亡户返家。反正者共带来步枪四支、手枪一支、子弹二百多发。还有好多顽伪人员则向我表示有机会即将逃回。我们向蒋阎占区普遍宣传了收复延安打下临汾的胜利消息，特别宣传了土地法大纲、保护工商业政策和对待伪顽人员的宽大政策。他们认识了共产党的政策，遂纷纷来归。有些想工作的介绍了工作，要回家的发给路费，带回枪的都得到奖金。他们说：早知道这样，早就回来了。有的则诉说在阎锡山那里一天只能喝两顿米汤，人都饿的面黄饥瘦，一句话说不对，就说你是“伪装分子”，乱棍打死，实在是活不下去了……。
