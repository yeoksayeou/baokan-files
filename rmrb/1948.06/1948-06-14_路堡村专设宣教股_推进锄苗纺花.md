　　Lubao Village Establishes Propaganda and Education Section
  　Promotes Weeding and Cotton Spinning
    [Li Cheng News] Since Lubao Village in the Second District corrected the erroneous struggle against middle peasants and provided compensation, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been very high (especially among middle peasants). The cadres organized a unified leadership production committee, with three sections: organization section, propaganda and education section, and sideline occupation section, with clear division of labor. The propaganda section took charge of the mass blackboard and broadcasting station, and developed thirty-six male and female correspondents. On the 28th of last month, a meeting of all correspondents was held at night. After group discussions, the following deviations were discovered: (1) Some had personal feelings, exaggerating facts, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. (2) Some had prejudices, failing to report achievements, causing dissatisfaction. For example, Lu Youping and Guo Yu, etc., did not have their achievements broadcast, so they personally went to the broadcasting station and argued with the correspondents, causing disputes. (3) Failure to conduct thorough personal investigations, writing hearsay material. (4) Feeling embarrassed to talk about their own achievements, forming a simple point of view of reporting on others; (5) Reporting every day is too tight, sometimes there is no good material that day, so they force a number. (6) Only paying attention to collecting materials, not paying attention to publicizing and explaining the Party's policies at any time and place. After everyone's discussion, the leadership made a summary, which was generally recognized as genuine shortcomings. Then, future work guidelines were discussed. Correspondents' groups were formed by region on a voluntary basis, and group leaders were elected. The masses in the village subscribed to ten copies of the New Masses Daily, and these people were equipped to study the Party's policies once every five or ten days. Focusing on actual conditions for work, breaking through considerations of personal feelings and prejudices, leading by example and broadcasting it, everyone believes and supports it. Not rigidly once a day, but based on the principle of having good material, at least once every three days. Finally, everyone proposed to carry out good publicity and mobilization, take the lead, and completely weed all the cotton in the village before June 3rd, and women must realize the textile plan twenty days before summer.

　　路堡村专设宣教股
  　推进锄苗纺花
    【黎城消息】二区路堡村自纠正错斗中农并补偿后，群众生产情绪很高（特别是中农），干部组织了统一领导的生产委员会，共设三个股，有组织股、宣教股、副业股，明确的分了工。宣传股掌握了大众黑板、广播台，发展了男女通讯员三十六个，并于上月廿八号夜，召开全体通讯员会议，经大家分组研究后，发现有以下几种偏向：（一）有种私人感情，扩大事实，群众不满。（二）有的成见，有成绩不会报，使他本人不满。如路友平、郭愚平等没有把他的成绩广播出来，就亲自找上广播台，并找通讯员讲理，造成纠纷；（三）没有很好地进行亲身调查，写道听途说的材料。（四）自己有成绩不好意思说，形成单纯的汇报别人的观点；（五）每天一汇报太紧，有时当天本来没什么好的材料，强凑数目。（六）只注意到收集材料，没注意到随时随地宣传和解释党的政策。经大家研究，领导上做了总结，公认为这真正是些缺点。接着又讨论了今后工作方针，按地区自愿结合，通讯小组选出组长。本村群众订有十份新大众报，配备这些人逢五逢十学习一次党的政策。为工作着眼从实际出发，打破情面与成见关系，自己以身作则带领去干，广播出来，大家也相信，也拥护，不死板每天一次，以有好材料为原则，至少三天一次。最后大家提出，要很好宣传鼓动，自己带头，在六月三号前把全村棉花完全锄完，妇女要实现夏前二十天纺织计划。（二丑、恩科、焕德）
