[Jinan News] Linqing City, Jinnan, transformed the Xiema Pavilion Temple Fair (originally a superstitious "welcoming and sending off" event, from the first day of the fourth month to the end of the fourth month in the old calendar) into a department store trade conference to develop industry and commerce and prosper the economy. The results achieved were truly amazing. Before the conference, the city's municipal party committee and government made thorough preparations, using various forms to widely publicize our party's policy of developing industry and commerce. At the preparatory meeting for the April conference convened by the city's Commercial Federation, representatives of various industries were informed that the government would adopt the policy of developing industry and commerce for the April conference. They were called upon to expand their business operations, and the government would resolutely protect them. A forum was also held with industrial and commercial owners to solicit their opinions on the development of industry and commerce. Director Wang Renzhong of the Administrative Office also gave clear instructions on the development of industry and commerce, dispelling the merchants' ideological concerns about being "struggled against" and not daring to expand their operations. The municipal government also specifically solved the merchants' difficulties based on their feedback. For example, the machinery industry was unable to prepare goods for the April conference because the capital was tied up in beating the roads with clods, so the government introduced them to banks for loans. The general merchandise industry was suffering from sluggish business due to a lack of sources of goods, so the Bureau of Industry and Commerce tried to open up a channel for them to transport and sell goods to Shijiazhuang. The municipal government also issued an order to abolish the burden on large carts, reducing the transportation costs for merchants. These practical actions to support industry and commerce further convinced merchants of our party's industrial and commercial policy. The city party committee led party member cadres in each street to carry out preliminary party rectification, correcting the erroneous thinking of cadres who regarded industry and commerce as the same as feudalism, and initially changing the relationship between cadres and the masses. At the same time, a meeting of workers and shop assistants was convened to review the past deviations in the labor movement, which hindered the development of industry and commerce due to excessively high labor conditions. During the discussion, the large cart workers especially felt that there would be no goods to transport without the development of industry and commerce, and the shop assistants also felt the necessity of implementing labor-capital mutual benefit. Due to such thorough preparations before the conference, the April trade conference presented a prosperity unprecedented since the War of Resistance Against Japan. Not only was the Bixia Palace market expanded, but also the livestock market and department store trade and other commercial venues, and a night market was opened up. The number of farmers and merchants attending the conference increased unprecedentedly. In the five days before the conference, there were more than 100,000 people. During the conference, according to preliminary statistics from the Commercial Federation: excluding the floating population from the countryside who came to the conference every day, there were 11,550 people living in Linqing city who attended the conference, and 2,886 people from various districts who came to the conference for business. The number of merchants from other districts who came to the city for trade also increased compared to before. According to statistics from the transportation industry from the first to the fifteenth of the fourth month, there were 921 merchants from various liberated areas. There were 162 merchants from the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Guests from Jinan, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places all praised the grand occasion of the April conference and the democratic government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. They carefully studied the People's Daily and Jinnan Daily, which published industrial and commercial policies. The number of merchants also increased. According to statistics from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, 68 new industrial and commercial households and 24 industrial product merchants were opened. There were a total of 542 temporary stalls at the conference, with 258 agricultural tool stalls alone, with a daily turnover of more than 4 million Jiao currency. According to preliminary statistics from the Chamber of Commerce, the total turnover of various industries that joined the Chamber of Commerce alone (excluding the grain industry, livestock, homespun cloth, and steamed buns) reached 323,693,300,000 Jiao currency in the half-month from the first to the fifteenth of the fourth month in the lunar calendar. As industrial and commercial transactions became increasingly prosperous, the income of transport workers and small vendors gradually increased. The large cart workers in Sanyuan Pavilion earned more than 10,000 yuan per person per day. The oil sellers in Yangji Yuan earned more than four taels a day, double the previous amount; the vendors selling spicy soup at the entrance of Da Si Mountain sold 170,000 yuan a day. Most of the urban poor reflected: "The development of industry and commerce is really good, the April conference really solves the problem." Therefore, when returning and compensating for wrongfully struggled against industrial and commercial businesses after the April conference, most of the poor people understood it at once; and said: "Developing industry and commerce is of long-term benefit to us."

　　坚决保护工商业发展农工业生产
  　临清百货大会盛况空前
    【冀南讯】冀南临清市为发展工商业，繁荣经济，把歇马亭庙会（原系一个“接驾送驾”的迷信大会，从旧年四月初一至四月底）改成百货贸易大会，所获成绩实在惊人。会前该市市委、市政府作了周密的准备，利用各种形式，普遍的宣传了我党发展工商业的政策。在该市商联合召开的四月大会筹备会上，向各业代表表明政府对四月大会是采取发展工商业的方针。号召各业中心扩大经营，政府坚决予以保护。又召集了工商业主座谈会，征求他们对发展工商业的意见。行署王任重主任对发展工商业也作了明确指示，解除了商人怕“斗”不敢扩大经营的思想顾虑。市政府并根据商人的反映，具体解决他们的困难。如机械业因打道钆占住资本，无法准备四月会的货物，政府乃介绍他们到银行贷款。广货业因没来源，生意萧条，工商局想法替他们开辟了往石家庄运销的道路。市政府并明令取消大车负担，减少商人运销费。这些扶持工商业的实际行动，使商人更进一步相信了我党工商业政策。市委领导各街党员干部进行了初步整党，纠正了干部把工商业和封建一样看待的错误思想，初步转变了干群关系。同时又召开了工人店员会议，检讨过去工运中因过高的劳动条件，而妨碍了工商业发展的偏向。讨论中大把车工人特别感觉到不发展工商业就没有货拉，店员也感觉到实行劳资两利的必要。由于会前进行了这样周密的准备，四月贸易大会呈现了抗日战争以来从所未有的繁荣。不但扩大了碧霞宫市场，也扩大了牲畜市及百货交易等商场，并开辟了夜市。赶会的农民和来往客商空前增多，在大会前五天。就有十万多人。大会期间，据商联会初步统计：除住在乡村每天来赶会的流动人口不计外，住在临清市内赶会的就有一万一千五百五十人，各区来会经商者两千八百八十六人。外区客商来市交易者较前也增加了。货运业自四月初一到十五日的统计，住有各解放区商人九百二十一人。蒋区商人一百六十二人。济南、天津、上海等地客人对于四月会的盛况与民主政府保护工商业的政策，莫不交口称赞。他们细心研读登载工商业政策的人民日报和冀南日报。商户也增加了，据工商局统计新开张的工商六十八户，工业出品商二十四户。会上的临时摊贩共有五百四十二户，只农具摊贩二百五十八户，每天即成交冀钞四百多万元。根据商会初步统计，仅加入商会的各业（粮业、牲畜、土布、面馍未统计在内）的商户，自阴历四月初一到十五半个月内，总成交即达冀钞三百二十三万万六千九百三十三万元。由于工商业交易日趋繁荣，运输工人和小商贩的收入也逐渐增加。三元阁的大把车工人，每人每天有赚一万多元的，养济院卖香油的每天肆两多，比以前增加一倍；大寺山门口卖胡辣汤的商贩，一天就卖了十七万元。城市贫民多数反映：发展了工商业真好，四月大会真解决问题。因之在四月会后进行退还、赔补错斗工商业时，多数贫民一说就通；并说：发展工商业对咱有长期好处。
