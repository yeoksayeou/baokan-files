Local armed forces in the Huaihai Sub-district, in coordination with a unit of the main force, advanced from May 7th to 10th south of the Haizhou-Zhengzhou highway and to the periphery of strongholds such as Xin’an Town and Ahu on both sides of the Suqian-Xin’anzhen highway, proactively attacking local Chiang bandits preparing to raid grain. They killed or wounded 56 and captured 377 alive. In early May, enemies from Lianshui attacked to loot wheat, but were repelled by local forces, who eliminated 75 enemies. The Huaibei Children's Corps, from April 21st, swept up local Chiang bandits preparing to loot grain in the Xian Gou area in northern Sisuxian (newly established county between Sixian and Suxian counties), capturing over 200 enemies. Local armed forces in Siyang and other counties repelled grain-looting enemies six times, killing or wounding 78 and capturing 74 alive. Sun Liangcheng's troops built small strongholds outside Siyang city, attempting to loot wheat from the suburbs, but were severely attacked by us and retreated entirely into the city. Local armed forces of the Ninth Sub-district on the north bank of the Yangtze River ambushed three companies of the puppet security team looting grain near Qilin Town in eastern Haimen on the 15th, eliminating over 100 enemies. On the 22nd, they captured Yudong Town in eastern Nantong, completely annihilating the defending enemies of two district public offices and self-defense forces, totaling 640. Armed forces in various counties and districts along the Kou'an-Taixian and Hai'an-Taixian lines have also launched attacks and reported victories frequently. In the above battles, a total of 36 light and heavy machine guns, 4 small cannons, 535 long and short guns, and 5 trucks were seized.
