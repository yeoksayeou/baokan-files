　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: A Moscow dispatch: The Soviet "New Times" weekly published on March 10th carried an article by French General Confederation of Labor Secretary-General Frachon, explaining that despite the frantic activities of the American and French reactionaries to undermine the unity of the General Confederation of Labor, it still enjoys the support and拥戴 of the vast majority of the French working class. Frachon stated: On December 19, 1947, when the "Workers' Force" faction of Stone House withdrew from the General Confederation of Labor, the French government and Labor Minister, the Socialist Meyer, spared no effort in their assistance to the "Workers' Force" faction. During the one month that this group existed, they received a total of 40.5 million francs in financial assistance. Employers collected membership for Stone House unions (i.e., the "Workers' Force" faction) in their factories, and reactionary newspapers touted it extensively. The "Workers' Force" faction announced that they had remarkable success among the miners, claiming that they had 150,000 members in the Pas-de-Calais mining area, while the General Confederation of Labor had only 100,000 members. While Stone House Co. indulged in exaggeration, the General Confederation of Labor's Mine Union issued 300,007 membership cards at the end of January this year! As many as last year. Later, the results of the election of the National Mining Area Management Committee showed that 306 members of the General Confederation of Labor were elected, while only three members of the "Workers' Force" faction were elected. Moreover, in the 95 provincial trade unions under the General Confederation of Labor, the Stone House Group only obtained a majority in the guiding committees of five provinces. In more than 30 industrial trade unions, only a majority of the four guiding committees agreed to join the "Workers' Force" faction. Frachon continued: The splitters once believed that their withdrawal and the Socialist Party's instruction requiring its members to split from the Communist Party would isolate the Communists in the trade unions, but this hope also disappeared. The mass of trade union members and a large number of fighting Socialists condemned the split. The five Socialists who resigned from the Secretariat of the General Confederation of Labor thought that no one could be found to replace them, but they miscalculated miserably. Stone House's position was replaced by Lipp, a non-party leader of the Civil Servants' League General Federation, and the remaining positions were replaced by three Socialists and one non-party person. How many members does the French General Confederation of Labor have now? Frachon replied: At the end of January, some of our major trade unions issued as many membership cards as last year, for example, the Metal Workers' Union issued 950,000 cards, while last year it was 953,000. The situation is the same for construction workers, chemical workers, sailors, dockworkers, and other trade unions. The General Confederation of Labor's accounting office totaled the same number of membership cards issued as last year – 6.45 million. Given the temporary difficulties caused by the retaliatory actions after the strike, assuming that not all membership cards have yet reached the hands of members, we expect to reach last year's figures in the coming months.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The Soviet "Labor Newspaper" commented on the activities of the "Workers' Force" faction formed by the traitor of the French working class, Houri, on the 13th, saying: As early as January this year, during the traditional annual renewal of trade union membership cards, their split plan completely collapsed. All major trade unions belonging to the General Confederation of Labor, including the Miners' Union and the Metal Workers' Union, maintained their membership at last year's level. After a long delay, the founding meeting of the "Workers' Force" faction held in April once again confirmed that the organizers of the split did not receive support from the working class. The "Economic Forum" newspaper, the mouthpiece of the French "Two Hundred Families" (referring to the 200 French banks, representing French financial and monopoly capital), said in frustration: At the "Workers' Force" faction meeting, "there was no purely worker component." It also said: "The split has not had any effect."

### 石屋分裂活动失败　法总工会强大如昔

　　石屋分裂活动失败
  　法总工会强大如昔
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科消息：三月十日出版的苏联“新时代”周刊登载法国总工会总书记佛拉商一文，说明尽管美法反动派进行疯狂的破坏总工会统一的活动，但它仍然得到法国工人阶级绝大多数的支持与拥戴。佛拉商称：一九四七年十二月十九日，当石屋的“工人力量”派退出总工会后，法国政府和劳工部长社会党人梅耶，曾不吝惜他们对“工人力量”派的援助，在这个集团存在的一个月中间，一共给了他们四千零五十万法郎的财产援助。雇主们则在他们的工厂里为石屋的工会（即“工人力量”派）征收会员，反动派的报纸也替它大肆吹嘘。“工人力量”派宣布他们在矿工中有卓越的成功，他们说，他们在加莱省矿工中有十五万会员，而总工会只有十万会员。当石屋公司沉溺于夸张之际，总工会的矿联在今年一月底发出了三十万零七千张会员证！这和去年一样的多。以后，全国各矿场管理委员会选举的结果，总工会会员当选者三百零六名，而“工人力量”派仅有三名当选。不仅如此，在总工会所属九十五个省的工会中，石屋集团只在五个省的指导委员会中得到多数。在三十多个工业工会中，只有四个指导委员会的多数赞成参加“工人力量”派。佛拉商继称：分裂者们曾经相信，他们的退出以及社会党要求其党员与共产党分裂的训令，将使工会中的共产党人孤立，但这一希望也消失了。工会会员群众和大量的战斗的社会党员痛斥了分裂行动。从总工会书记处辞职的五名社会党人，曾以为找不出任何人来代替他们，但他们悲惨地计算错了。石屋的职位和公务员联盟总会的无党派领袖里普所代替，其余的职位由三个社会党员与一个无党派人士所代替，法国总工会现在有多少会员呢？佛拉商回答道：在一月底，我们一些主要的工会发出了与去年同样多的会员证，例如金属工人工会发出了九十五万张，而去年是九十五万三千张。建筑工人、化学工人、水手、码头工人和其他工会的情形也是一样。总工会会计处总计发出了与去年同样多的会员证——六百四十五万张。鉴于罢工后的报复行动所造成的暂时困难，假定还不是所有的会员证都已到达会员的手中，但我们预期今后数月内将达到去年的数目字。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】苏联劳动报于十三日著论评由法国工人阶级的叛徒屋里所形成之“工人力量”派的活动称：早在今年一月，在传统的一年一度更换职工会会员证期间，他们的分裂计划就全部垮台了。所有属于总工会的各主要工会，包括矿工工会及五金工人工会，其会员人数仍然保持了去年的水平。经过长期延期之后，四月份举行的“工人力量”派的成立大会，再一次证实了分裂的组织者，在工人阶级中没有得到支持。法国“两百家”（按指法国的两百家银行，系法国金融与垄断资本的代称。）的喉舌“经济论坛”报沮丧地说：在“工人力量”派的大会上，“纯粹的工人成份是没有的”。又说：“分裂未曾收到任何效果。”
