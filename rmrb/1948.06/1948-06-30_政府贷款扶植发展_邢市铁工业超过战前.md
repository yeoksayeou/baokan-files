　　Government Loans Support Development
  　Xingtai's Iron Industry Surpasses Pre-War Levels
    (Editor's Note: After the Japanese surrender, Xingtai's industry and commerce suffered undue infringement due to the anti-traitor purge, overly left-leaning labor movement policies, and the mechanical and erroneous application of methods used in rural struggles against feudal and semi-feudal elements to urban industry and commerce. However, Xingtai has made achievements in transforming its old business direction and combining urban industry and commerce with rural needs. This report illustrates this aspect. Comrades in Xingtai still need to work hard to improve other aspects.)
    [Our Newspaper News] A responsible comrade from the Xingtai City Federation of Trade Unions told reporters that since Xingtai's liberation, the city's iron industry has continued to develop and expand. The number of factories, the number of employees, the output and the quality have all exceeded the Kuomintang ruling period and the period of Japanese puppet enslavement before the War of Resistance. Before the incident, there were only three iron factories in the city, manufacturing simple waterwheels, plows, hand-operated cotton bows, and the like. During the period of Japanese puppet enslavement (according to a survey when it was just liberated in 1945), there were sixteen iron factories with one hundred and seventy-two employees. In the two or three years since the city's liberation, the iron industry has been able to develop greatly thanks to the elimination of the enemy and puppet coal and iron rule, the steady supply of raw materials, the breaking of the urban-rural divide, and the close connection between the city and the countryside. In particular, the large-scale development of handicrafts and textiles in the countryside after the land reform has opened up a broad market for the machine-manufacturing industry--iron factories. In the winter of 1946, a cooperative in Changzhi ordered one hundred cotton bows at once. These many favorable conditions, coupled with the democratic government's more than 20 million yuan (Jicha, same below) of iron industry loans in recent years, have enabled the Xingtai iron industry to develop substantially. At the end of 1946, the number of iron factories had increased to twenty, with one hundred and ninety-nine employees, producing one hundred and thirty-five cotton ginning machines, two hundred and seventeen hand-operated cotton bows, four hundred and seventeen animal-powered cotton bows, twenty-three spinning machines, five thousand and four hundred pots, and forty-three thousand catties of other miscellaneous iron goods in one year. The output of cotton bows alone increased by 420% compared with before liberation. In July 1947, the number of iron factories had increased to 23, with two hundred and sixty-three employees. Some achievements have also been made in the invention of tools and the improvement of products. The most important tool in the iron factory, the lathe, which could only rely on foreign goods in the past, can now produce one every two months; the workers of the Gongji Iron Factory have further converted the lathe into a planing machine to increase the output of the feeding nozzle (an important part of the cotton bow), which used to be only able to produce one pair at a time, to five pairs at a time. The factory also manufactured bicycle axles that Xingtai had never been able to manufacture before. They are durable, beautiful, and not inferior to foreign goods. The Minsheng Factory is producing steel saws (a part of the cotton bow) on a large scale, which Xingtai could not manufacture in the past. If the electric roller, which is being actively planned, is launched, the quality of the steel saw will be able to completely catch up with foreign goods. At this time, the Jingxing Iron Factory created a lightweight spinning machine with fifty spindles; the Dazhong Iron Factory invented an iron-wheel loom that can produce ten feet of cloth per day. Since the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu issued instructions to protect industry and commerce, in addition to striving to correct policies, the city has also used 7 million yuan of iron industry loans to support iron factories, and each factory has further developed. Manager Gao of Junxing Iron Factory immediately borrowed 700,000 yuan to add lathes and recruit workers in preparation for a major effort. The Tongsheng Factory, which manufactures lathes, has added seven or eight workers, and three companies have come to buy his lathes with money before they have even been produced. The Minsheng Factory is also renovating its storefront and preparing for an electric roller.

　　政府贷款扶植发展
  　邢市铁工业超过战前
    （编者按：邢台在日本投降后，由于反奸清算，过左的工运政策，以及把农村斗争封建半封建的方式，机械地错误的搬运到城市中来对付工商业，以致使邢台工商业受到不应有的侵犯。但邢台在转变旧的经营方向，把城市工商业与农村需要相结合方面，确有成绩，这一报导是说明这一个侧面，其他方面邢台工作同志尚需努力改进。）
    【本报讯】邢台市工会某负责同志告记者说：自邢台解放后，该市铁业一直发展与扩大，工厂数目、职工人数、产量与质量等，均超过抗战前国民党统治时期与日伪奴役时期。该市在事变前仅有铁工厂三家，造些简单的水车、犁铧、人力弹花弓等。日伪奴役时期（一九四五年刚解放时的调查），有铁工厂十六家，职工一百七十二名。该市解放后，两三年来，由于扫除了敌伪的煤铁统治，有了源源不绝的原料供给，打破了城乡隔绝的局面，使城市与乡村密切联系起来；特别是经过土地改革的农村，手工业与纺织业大量的发展，给机器制造业——铁工厂开辟了广阔的销路。四六年冬，长治一个合作社一下就订了一百多张弹花弓。这许多便利条件加上民主政府近年来两千多万元（冀钞，下同）铁业贷款的扶植，使邢市铁业得到大量的发展。一九四六年底铁工厂已增到二十家，职工一百九十九人，一年内出产轧花车一百三十五架，人力弹花弓二百一十七张，畜力弹花弓四百一十七张，纺纱机二十三架，锅五千四百口，其他零星铁货四万三千斤。仅弹花弓一项与解放前相比，即提高了产量百分之四百廿。一九四七年七月，铁工厂已增至廿三家，职工二百六十三名。在发明工具、改进产品方面，并获得若干成绩。过去只能依赖外货的铁工厂内最重要的工具——旋床，现在每两月能产一架了；工记铁厂的职工为进一步把旋床改成为刨床，使过去一下只能造一对的进花嘴（一种弹花弓的重要零件），提高到一下能出五对。该厂并制造了邢市从来不能制造的脚踏车轴，耐用美观，均不次于外来货。民生工厂则在大量出产过去邢市不能制造的钢锯（弹花弓的一种零件），如果正在积极筹划的电滚出世，钢锯的质量就能完全赶上外来的洋货。镜兴铁厂这时创造了五十根头的轻便纺纱机；大众铁厂发明了每天能出十丈布的铁轮织布机。自晋冀鲁豫中央局保护工商业指示公布后，除努力端正政策外该市又以七百万元的铁业贷款扶植铁工厂，各厂都有进一步发展。俊兴铁厂的高经理，立即贷款七十万元，添买旋床，召收工人，准备大干。制造旋床的同盛工厂，已增加工人七、八名，他的旋床还没有制出，就有三家拿上钱来买了。民生工厂也在修饰门面，筹办电滚。
