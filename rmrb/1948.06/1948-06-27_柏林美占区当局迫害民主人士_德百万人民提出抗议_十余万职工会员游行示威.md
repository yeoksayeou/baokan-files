Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st Dispatch: TASS Berlin Dispatch: Over a million Germans jointly signed a telegram on the 12th, addressed to Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, General Kotikov, Commander of the Soviet Forces in Berlin, the Allied Command, the German People's Council, and other organizations, protesting the persecution by the Western occupation authorities in Berlin of democrats who demanded a referendum on the reunification of Germany.

Another dispatch: On the 8th, the US occupation authorities in Berlin dispatched police to search and seize the offices of the Free German Trade Union Federation in the area, confiscating its property and documents, and arresting trade union personnel who advocated unification. The next day, representatives of the so-called "Independent Trade Union Opposition," directed by the United States, namely the Schumacher group, a minority faction of the Executive Bureau of the Free German Trade Union Federation, took the US authorities' orders and declared themselves "trustees" of these offices. In response to this violent act, similar to those used by the Hitlerites in 1933, more than 100,000 Berlin trade union members gathered in the streets on the 14th, holding up banners reading "Protest against US Police Terror," and marched and demonstrated in the city center. The members of the Greater Berlin Free German Trade Union Federation also unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Western occupation authorities cease interfering in the internal affairs of the trade union, return the confiscated trade union property, disband the Democratic Alliance in West Berlin, and improve the material and legal status of workers in West Berlin.

　　柏林美占区当局迫害民主人士
  　德百万人民提出抗议
    十余万职工会员游行示威
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社柏林讯：百余万德国人于十二日联合签名致电德境。苏军总司令索尔洛夫斯基元帅、柏林苏军司令柯提柯夫将军、各盟军指挥部、德国人民议会及其他团体，抗议柏林西部占领区迫害要求举行公民投票以复决德国统一问题的民主人士。
    又讯：柏林美占区当局于八日出动警察，搜查与强占了该区自由德国职工联合会的办事处，没收了该会的财产和文件，逮捕了赞成统一的职工会的工作人员。次日，受美国指挥的所谓“独立职工会反对派”，亦即自由德国职工联合会执行局的少数派舒马赫集团的代表，就拿着美国当局的命令，自居为这些办事处的“托管人”。为答复这种类似一九三三年希特勒分子使用过的暴力手段，柏林职工会会员十万余人于十四日群集街头，举起“抗议美国警察恐怖行动”的旗子，在市中心游行示威。大柏林自由德国职工联合会会员亦一致通过决议，要求西区占领当局终止干涉职工会内部事务，归还被没收的职工会财产，解散柏林西区的民主联盟，及改善柏林西区工人的物质和法律的地位。
