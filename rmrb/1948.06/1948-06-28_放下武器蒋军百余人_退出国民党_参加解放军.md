　　【Jizhong News】A unit of Chiang soldiers, totaling one hundred and eight men, who laid down their arms in battles such as the one at Beida Ran, joined a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the 16th of this month. This included some officers and soldiers from the artillery battalion of the Provisional 32nd Division of Chiang's bandit New Second Army. After more than three months of education from the military and civilians in the liberated areas, these Chiang army officers and soldiers gradually awakened and applied to withdraw from the Kuomintang and join the People's Liberation Army to fight to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. A solemn withdrawal and joining ceremony was held. Chiang soldier Song Lianke said at the meeting: "In the past, for personal enjoyment and status, I joined the Kuomintang, and as a result, I jumped into the fire pit. After being liberated, the people were generous and allowed me to study and make progress. Thinking about it, I really regret it too much. I declare my separation from the Kuomintang, and on behalf of eight classmates in the second squad, I apply to withdraw from the party and the团 (League), and at the same time request to join the People's Liberation Army and perform meritorious service for the people." Afterwards, others also swore to withdraw from the Kuomintang. A total of fifty-seven Kuomintang members and 三青团 (Three Youth League) members withdrew from the party and the团 (League), and one hundred and eight Chiang soldiers were approved to join the People's Liberation Army.

    【冀中讯】在北大冉等战斗中放下武器的蒋军一部共一百零八名，于本月十六日参加人民解放军某部。其中并有蒋匪新二军暂卅二师炮兵营官兵一部。这些蒋军官兵经过解放区军民三个多月的教育，逐渐觉悟，纷纷申请退出国民党，参加解放军，为消灭蒋介石而战。并举行了庄严的退党参加仪式。解放蒋军宋联科在会上说：“过去为了个人享受和地位，参加了国民党，结果是跳入了火坑。被解放后，人民宽大为怀，让我学习进步，思想起来，实在太后悔。我声明脱离国民党，并代表二班八位同学，申请退党退团，同时要求参加人民解放军，为民立功。”接着别人也纷纷宣誓退出国民党，计有五十七名国民党党员与三青团团员退党退团，一百零八名解放蒋军被批准参加人民解放军。
