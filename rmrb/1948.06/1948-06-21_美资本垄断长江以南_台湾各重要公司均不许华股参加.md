Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. As the head of the Chiang government's "Technical Delegation to the United States," Bei Zuyi, went to the United States again, Shanghai news circles revealed the inside story of Bei Zuyi and He Yingqin's activities in the United States last time. It is reported that during He and Bei's stay in the United States, they held talks with the US State Department, demarcating the area south of the Yangtze River and Taiwan as a monopoly area for American capital. Major American banks intend to establish a large joint-stock company and plan to merge the existing tin, tungsten, antimony, and other mining companies in the Chiang area, the various development companies in Taiwan, and the transportation companies in South China to form a complete economic system for the United States to monopolize South China. It is rumored that this highly monopolistic joint-stock company will not allow Chinese shares to participate, but will only give Chiang Kai-shek and Song Ziwen certain benefits in some form. The United States has also obtained important strategic locations such as Taiwan, Hainan Island, Shantou, Xiamen, Shanghai, and Hankou as naval, land, and air force bases. All American ships can freely enter, exit, and berth in these areas. It is worth noting that at almost the same time, on April 8th and May 23rd, US Ambassador Stuart and the head of the US military advisory group, Badawi, successively visited Guangzhou and Taiwan. Although their mission was kept secret, it is widely believed that their main purpose was to realize the US plan to monopolize South China. According to Leiphan, the US "aid" Chiang plan executor who arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month, when he met with the Central News Agency's US-based reporter in Washington on the 25th of last month, he said: "Future US support for China will depend on whether the aid materials to China are effectively utilized and how much the United States receives in return for the gifts and loans it pays for its invasion of China plan." The US monopoly of South China is obviously part of the price Leiphan mentioned.

　　美资本垄断长江以南
  　台湾各重要公司均不许华股参加
    【新华社陕北十八日电】当蒋政府“赴美技术代表团”团长贝祖诒再度赴美时，上海新闻界方面传出上次贝祖诒与何应钦在美活动的内幕。据悉何、贝二人留美期间，曾与美国务院举行商谈，划定长江以南地区及台湾作为美国资本之垄断范围。美国各大银行拟成立一大股份公司，并计划合并蒋区现有之锡、钨、锑等采掘公司、台湾各开拓公司以及华南的运输公司，构成美国独占华南的完整的经济体系。据传此富有垄断性之股份公司，将不允华股参加，只在某种形式下给予蒋介石、宋子文二人以一定利益。美国并已取得台湾、海南岛、汕头、厦门、上海及汉口等重要战略地点，作为海陆空军基地，所有美国船舰，得自由出入与停泊于此等地区。值得注意的是差不多在同一时间，在四月八日和五月廿三日，美国大使司徒雷登与美军顾问团团长巴大维曾先后访问广州与台湾，其使命虽秘而不宣，但众信其主要目的即为实现美国独占华南计划。按本月七日抵沪之美国“助”蒋计划执行人莱普汉，于上月二十五日在华盛顿接见中央社驻美记者时称：“未来美国之对华支持，将以援华物资之是否被有效利用，以及美国因侵华计划而付出之赠与及贷款所得代价如何而定”。美国独占华南，显然即是莱普汉口中所说代价的一部分。
