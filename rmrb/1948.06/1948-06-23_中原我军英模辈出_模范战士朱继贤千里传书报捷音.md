　　The Central Plains People's Liberation Army sees an Outpouring of Heroes and Models
  　Model Soldier Zhu Jixian Sends News of Victory Over a Thousand Miles
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] During the arduous struggle in the Dabie Mountains, many heroes and role models emerged. Zhu Jixian, one of the model soldiers of a certain company of a certain column, whose home is in Houluzi Village, Xingtai, Hebei, recently wrote a letter to his father, Zhu Fengkui. From this letter, we can see how the warriors of the Dabie Mountains are filled with a firm fighting spirit to serve the people and an unwavering belief in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. The original text reads: "May parents be well. On April 14th, I received the letter broadcast by the Handan Radio Station, and I am very happy. I am working smoothly outside and am in good health, so please don't worry. I also wish the two elders good health at home, I hope. In addition, I would like to report to you the great victories our army has achieved since the counter-offensive began last July. As soon as we crossed the Yellow River, we wiped out nine and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and then we fought all the way to the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the Dabie Mountains (eastern Hubei), we annihilated the 40th Division and the 829th Brigade of the 52nd Division, and established a vast base area of more than 2,000 li. In the past few months, I have "performed meritorious service" in serving the people and have received the "Second-Class Model Award" three times. Are you happy to hear that?! The current situation is that Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse. I am determined to go home and see you after Chiang Kai-shek is overthrown. Furthermore, the telegram from the He Zhulin family in our village has also been broadcast. He is currently working smoothly and is in good health. In the struggle to counter-attack, annihilate the enemy, and build the Dabie Mountain base area, he is a Second-Class Model. Please tell the He Delin family. May you be well, and may all the village cadres be well, no further details." There are many model soldiers like the one who wrote this letter in the Dabie Mountain struggle. Taking a certain regiment of a certain army as an example: there are model platoon leader Chang Enke from Zuoquan, Shanxi. Liu Yaochang from Zhuangshang Village, Er District, Shexian County, Henan. Deputy Platoon Leader Wang Yaozheng, Caozhuang, Qixian County, Henan, Model Squad Leader Bao Erchou, Jiahe, Wuxiang, Shanxi. Zhang Linan, Shuipo Village, Zuoquan, Shanxi.
