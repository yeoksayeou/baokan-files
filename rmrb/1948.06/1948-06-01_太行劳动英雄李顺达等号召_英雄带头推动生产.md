　　【Taihang News】At the height of the current busy spring plowing and sowing season, prominent labor heroes in the Taihang District, Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en (both from Pingshun County), along with Pingshun County's male and female labor heroes Guo Shuangtong, Song Xiaoqiu, Cui Fubao, Zhang Jianfu, and Wang Siniu, totaling seven individuals, issued an open letter to all heroes in the county on the 18th of this month in order to vigorously promote the production movement. They called on everyone to sincerely examine past shortcomings and diligently lead the masses in launching a major agricultural and sideline production campaign. The letter stated: On May 17th, several of us held a forum in the county to review the many erroneous thoughts that arose after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law. For example, we feared not passing the democratic party rectification and did not understand the correct class line, thinking that the rise of the poor and hired peasants meant not wanting the middle peasants and heroes, etc. Because of these erroneous thoughts, we abandoned or did not boldly lead the masses in production, thinking "the less we do, the fewer mistakes we make," which is very wrong. At the same time, we also identified many shortcomings in our past leadership of production, which we want to publicly examine with the masses today. The main issue is the undemocratic style of work, forcing the masses to formally set a plan, and if it is not completed, forcibly carrying out shock work, such as forcing the masses to cut crops and plow at night, especially last year, in order to complete the autumn plowing plan, forcing the masses to cut green crops, resulting in a reduced grain harvest. In addition, setting textile plans was like assigning burdens, forcibly making up numbers, without promoting production according to everyone's requirements. Now we are determined to correct these shortcomings in this year's production movement and diligently lead the masses to become prosperous. To achieve this goal, we plan to do the following four things, and hope everyone will work together: First, listen to the opinions of the masses and accept them; second, establish a democratic leadership style and consult with the masses more on everything we do; third, rectify mutual aid, democratically formulate labor point wage methods, democratically set plans, and arrange life; fourth, personally take the lead as a model and lead the masses to become prosperous through production. We hope that all heroic comrades will also sincerely examine their past shortcomings with the masses, eliminate chaotic and uneasy thoughts, and diligently lead and organize the masses to produce and save themselves, and move towards prosperity.

　　太行劳动英雄李顺达等号召
  　英雄带头推动生产
    【太行消息】正值目前春耕下种紧张时期，太行区著名劳动英雄李顺达、郭玉恩（均系平顺县人），及平顺县男女劳动英雄郭双童、宋小秋、崔富保、张建伏、王四妞等七人，为大力推动生产运动，在本月十八日特给该县全体英雄们发出公开信，号召大家诚恳检讨过去毛病，好好带领群众开展个农副业大生产运动。该信称：五月十七日，我们几个人在县里开了个座谈会，检讨了我们在土地法大纲公布后发生的许多错误思想：比如害怕民主整党过不了关，又不了解正确的阶级路线，以为贫雇起来就是不要中农、不要英雄啦等；因为有这些错误思想作怪，便放弃或不大胆领导群众生产，心想“少作一点，少出一点错”，这是很不对的；同时，我们还检查出以往领导生产中的不少毛病，今天要向群众公开检讨：主要是作风不民主，强迫群众形式主义的订一套计划，如完不成，强制进行突击，比如硬叫群众黑夜割庄稼、犁地，特别是去年为了完成秋耕计划，硬叫群众把青庄稼割了，少打了好多粮食。另外，订纺织计划是象派负担一样，硬凑数目，不按大家要求推动生产。现在我们决心在今年生产运动中纠正这些毛病，好好领导群众发家致富。为达到这个目的，我们计划要做到以下四点，希大家共同努力：一是倾听群众意见，接受群众意见；二是树立民主领导作风，办事一定多和群众商量；三是整顿互助，民主制定折工工资办法，民主订计划，安排生活；四是亲自带头起模范，领导群众生产致富。我们希望全体英雄同志们，也要诚恳向群众检讨自己过去的毛病，去掉混乱不安的思想，好好领导组织群众生产自救，走向发家致富。
