　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Moscow News: On the tenth anniversary (May 17th) of Stalin's speech on Soviet advanced science, the Pravda published an editorial stating: "We are faced with a fortress called science. We must take this fortress at any cost. This fortress must be taken by young people. If they hope to become the creators of a new life, if they hope to truly replace the older generation, the socialist country opens the door of science to young people." Tsarist Russia's higher education institutions ranked last in Europe, while in the Soviet Union before the war, the number of students in higher education was greater than the total of all European countries. Kaftanov, the Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union, wrote in Pravda: "In the ten years since Stalin's speech, a new generation of young scientists has emerged in our country. The number of scientific workers in higher education institutions alone has increased from 55,000 in 1938 to 70,000 this year. During the same period, more than 6,000 scientific workers have obtained doctoral degrees, 25,000 have become professors, 25,500 have obtained the title of assistant professor or senior scientific worker; and 13,000 graduates of higher schools and research institutes are preparing to engage in scientific work. In the past ten years, higher education institutions have trained approximately 750,000 engineers, agriculturalists, economic experts, doctors, teachers and other specialized talents for all sectors of the national economy and culture, many of whom have become outstanding and brave pioneers in science, industry, and agriculture. The higher education network has also been greatly expanded, from 708 in 1938 to the current 802. There are now 670,000 students in higher education institutions. In the past ten years, workers in higher education institutions have completed more than 50,000 research projects on many scientific and technological issues. One hundred and twenty-four people in higher education institutions have been awarded Stalin Prizes for scientific research. Stalin put forward a very important task for scientific workers, that is, in the near future, not only to catch up with but also to surpass foreign scientific achievements."

　　苏联十年中培养出七十五万专门人材
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于斯大林关于苏维埃进步科学演说十周年（五月十七日）之际，特发表社论称：我们面临着一个堡垒，这个堡垒叫做科学。我们必须不惜任何代价，取得这个堡垒。这一堡垒必须由青年取得。假如他们希望成为新生活的缔造者，假如他们希望真正代替老一辈的话，社会主义国家为青年盛开着科学之门。沙皇俄国的高等教育机关，数目占欧洲末位，而苏联在战前，高等学校学生的数目已大于欧洲各国之总和。苏联高等教育部部长卡夫坦诺夫在真理报上著文称：斯大林演说后的十年内，我国已出现了新的一代青年科学家。只是高等学校的科学工作者，就从一九三八年的五万五千人，增至今年的七万人。在同一时期，已有六千多科学工作者获得博士学位，两万五千人作了教授，两万五千五百人获得助教或高级科学工作者头衔；并有一万三千高级学校和研究院毕业的学生，准备从事科学工作。过去十年中，高等学校为国民经济及文化的一切部门，训练出了约七十五万工程师、农业家、经济专家、医生、教师及其他专门人材，其中很多人已成绩卓著地成为科学工业与农业各方面的勇敢先锋。高等教育网亦大为扩充，自一九三八年的七百零八所，增加为现在的八百零二所。现在高等学校的学生达六十七万人。过去十年间，高等教育机关工作者，在科学和技术的很多问题上，完成了五万余种研究。高等学校中，有一百二十四人，因科学研究而荣获斯大林奖金。斯大林对科学工作者提出了非常重要的任务，即在不久的将来，不仅要赶上而且要超过外国的科学成就。
