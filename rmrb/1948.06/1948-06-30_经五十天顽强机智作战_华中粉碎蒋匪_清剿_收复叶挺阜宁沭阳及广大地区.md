Xinhua News Agency, Northern Jiangsu Front, 28th -- After fifty days (April 25th to June 15th) of tenacious and resourceful combat, the military and civilians of Northern Jiangsu completely shattered the enemy's "mopping-up" and "encirclement and suppression" plans, annihilating more than 14,000 enemy troops and recovering the towns of Ye Ting (Yancheng), Funing, Shuyang, and Hede, as well as vast areas surrounding them, which had been occupied by the enemy.

In March and April, Chiang Kai-shek's troops transferred the reorganized 25th, 72nd, and 83rd Divisions, totaling three divisions, from the Central Plains and Shandong to Northern Jiangsu, and added the reorganized 4th Division to form two "pursuit and suppression" corps, led by Huang Botao, commander of the 25th Division, and Zhang Xuezhong, director of the Seventh Pacification Zone, under the direct command of Gu Zhutong, to conduct a large-scale "encirclement and suppression," attempting to use this superior force to drive away or annihilate the main force of the People's Liberation Army. The points and lines along the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal were defended by the reorganized 21st Division, reorganized 44th Division, reorganized 51st Division, Provisional 23rd Division, and Provisional 25th Division.

At the end of April, the Chiang Kai-shek army's northern "pursuit and suppression" corps, the reorganized 72nd and 83rd Divisions, invaded eastward from Lianghuai (Huaiyin and Huai'an). We blocked them along the way, killing or wounding more than 700 enemy troops. On May 9th, the enemy occupied Funing, but a strong PLA force suddenly appeared on the enemy's flank. Fearing annihilation, the enemy hastily retreated westward. Afterwards, the enemy suspected that our main force had reached the Huaihai area (a district of Northern Jiangsu, administering nine counties north of Huaiyin), and on the 11th, they turned their troops north to "pursue and suppress," and transferred the 3rd Rapid Column from Southern Shandong to assist with aircraft and tanks. On the 20th, the enemy occupied Shuyang. Under the pressure of the enemy's heavy forces, our Huaihai local armed forces still maneuvered and fought the enemy, killing or wounding 700 more enemy troops. At the same time, the southern "pursuit and suppression" corps of the Chiang Kai-shek army, the reorganized 4th and 25th Divisions, invaded from Haian and Dongtai. The PLA suddenly appeared south of Ye Ting city at this time, and when the enemy advanced to the Wuyou and Biancang line on the 23rd, it surrounded and attacked them. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, more than 3,000 enemy troops, including Yang Tingyan (wounded), the commander of the 108th Brigade of the reorganized 25th Division, were killed or wounded. Seeing this situation, Gu Zhutong urgently ordered his northern troops to move south to rescue them, attempting to combine forces with the southern troops to attack our army. However, after inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, our army quickly transferred, and the enemy's plan failed, occupying only the isolated cities of Funing and Ye Ting. The enemy then invaded eastward, penetrating east of the (South) Tong (Ganzhou) Yu Highway and south of the Sheyang River to the Hede town (east of Funing) area. Although the situation in Northern Jiangsu was once tense at this time, a strong PLA force immediately appeared in the rear heartland of the Chiang Kai-shek army, and simultaneously launched attacks on the enemy's river defense, canal, and Longhai lines. From June 7th to 13th, we successively captured more than 20 large and small strongholds on the periphery of Taizhou, such as Jiangyan and Qutang; the periphery of Qidong, such as Taian and Hexing; the Huai (yin) Su (qian) line, such as Laian and Geji; and the periphery of Xin (pu) Hai (zhou), such as Dunshang, Baitaibu, and Niushan Railway Station, annihilating a total of 6,000 enemy troops. At the same time, our southern local armed forces also took advantage of the enemy's heavy troops invading north to advance towards the enemy's points and lines. In mid-May, the local armed forces of the First Military Sub-district attacked the Kou (an) Tai (zhou) line, reaching the riverbank and capturing towns such as Daqiao and Sima along the way. The local armed forces of the Ninth Military Sub-district successively captured Yudong in Nantong, Huihe in Qidong, and strongholds such as Shili Miao and Dongchen in the suburbs of Rugao, totaling 4,000 enemy troops annihilated by the local armed forces. At this time, the enemy was under pressure due to the tension in its rear and river defense; at the same time, the East China PLA launched attacks on the Jinpu Railway section from Jinan to Yanzhou and Kaifeng, and the reorganized 25th, 72nd, and 83rd Divisions of the enemy were forced to withdraw north; the reorganized 4th Division was transferred to the southern line to strengthen the "river defense." On June 4th, we recovered Shuyang, on the 6th, we recovered Funing, and on the 11th, we recovered Ye Ting. The vast surrounding areas of various places also returned to our hands. Thus, the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" plan completely failed. In total, we captured 31 artillery pieces of various types, 230 light and heavy machine guns, 123 carbines, Thompson submachine guns, 27 grenade launchers, 3,489 long and short guns, more than 177,000 rounds of ammunition, 4 cars, 4 radio stations, and 50 telephone sets in the entire campaign.

　　经五十天顽强机智作战
  　华中粉碎蒋匪“清剿”
    收复叶挺阜宁沭阳及广大地区
    【新华社苏北前线二十八日电】苏北军民经过五十天（四月二十五日至六月十五日）顽强机智作战，完全粉碎了敌人的“扫荡”、“清剿”计划，先后歼敌一万四千余人，并收复被敌侵占的叶挺（盐城）、阜宁、沭阳、合德等城镇及其周围广大地区。
    三、四月间，蒋军由中原、山东抽调二十五、七二、八三共三个整编师开往苏北，另加整四师组成南北两个“追剿”兵团，分由二十五师师长黄伯韬及第七绥区主任张雪中率领，并由顾祝同亲自指挥，进行大规模“清剿”，企图以此优势兵力驱逐或歼灭解放军主力。其沿长江、运河之点线则由整二十一师、整四十四师、整五十一师、暂二十三师、暂二十五师防御。
    四月底，北线蒋军“追剿”兵团整七二师、八三师由两淮（淮阴、淮安）东犯，我于沿途阻击，杀伤敌七百余人。五月九日敌占阜宁，但解放军强大兵团突然出现于敌之侧背，敌畏惧被歼，慌忙西撤。其后，敌又疑我主力已至淮海地区（我苏北之一个分区，辖淮阴以北九县），十一日起转兵向北“追击”，并从山东南调第三快速纵队以飞机、坦克助战。二十日敌侵占沭阳。我淮海地方武装在敌重兵压境下仍机动与敌周旋，先后毙伤敌七百余。与此同时，南线蒋军“追剿”兵团整四师、整二十五师自海安、东台出犯。解放军突于此时出现于叶挺城南，待敌于二十三日进至伍佑、卞仓一线时即将其包围攻击，经两昼夜激战，毙伤敌整二十五师一○八旅旅长杨庭晏（伤）以下三千余名。顾祝同睹此情况，急令其北线部队南下救援，并妄图与南线部队合击我军。但我军予敌重创后已迅速转移，敌计未逞，仅占阜宁、叶挺两座孤城。该敌旋又东犯，深入（南）通（赣）榆公路以东，射阳河以南至合德镇（阜宁东）地区。此时苏北局面虽曾一度紧张，但解放军强大兵团立即出现于蒋军后方心脏，同时向敌之江防、运河及陇海等线展开攻击。自六月七日至十三日连克泰州外围之姜堰、曲塘；启东外围之泰安、合兴；淮（阴）宿（迁）线之来安、葛集；新（浦）海（州）外围之墩尚、白塔埠、牛山车站等大小据点二十余处，共歼敌六千人。同时我南线地方武装亦乘敌重兵北犯时向敌点线挺进。一分区地方武装于五月中旬进击口（岸）泰（州）线，直抵江边，一路攻下大桥，嘶马等镇。九分区地方武装则连克南通之余东，启东之惠和及如皋城郊之十里庙、东陈等据点，总计地方武装歼敌达四千人。敌此时因其后方及江防吃紧；同时华东解放军又对津浦铁路济南至兖州段及开封等地展开攻击，敌整二十五师、整七二师、整八三师乃被迫北撤；整四师则调往南线增强“江防”。六月四日我收复沭阳，六日收复阜宁，十一日收复叶挺，各地周围广大地区亦重归我手。至此敌之“清剿”计划，乃全告失败。总计全役我缴获各种炮三十一门，轻重机枪二百三十挺，卡宾、汤姆等自动枪一百二十三支，掷弹筒二十七个，长短枪三千四百八十九支，子弹十七万七千余发，汽车四辆，电台四部，电话机五十架。
