Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: The Construction Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government studied the typical materials from three severely disaster-stricken townships: one township in Wuzhuang District, Zhenchuan County (newly established county, northwest of Mizhi), Suide Sub-region; four townships in Xiangshi District, Jia County; and one township in Gaojiagou District, Zizhou County (newly established county, west of Suide). It concluded that combining production and disaster relief was a successful experience. These three townships originally had a total of 1,402 households, 5,684 people, including 1,240 laborers. Due to the famine, 425 households migrated (a decrease of 30.3%), 1,599 people (a decrease of 28.1%), and 525 laborers (a decrease of 42.3%). Livestock in the three townships decreased by about 70% due to being robbed and killed by bandits and taken away by migrants. The three townships suffered particularly severe famine, and the labor force was greatly reduced, making food and seeds extremely difficult to obtain. Under these difficult conditions, thanks to the cadres fully grasping the policy of combining production and disaster relief, going deep into the masses, and providing specific leadership, 53.5% of the original 16,402 hectares of cultivated land in the three townships had been sown by mid-May. Continued planting is estimated to complete 87.8%, with the remaining 12.2% that may be abandoned mostly being poor land or remote land. The production and disaster relief experience of the three townships is as follows:

　　(1) Universally organize semi-laborers to participate in production. After 42.3% of the total labor force migrated, women and children played a significant role in production. For example, in the four townships of Xiangshi District in Jia County, 180 women and 161 children participated in agricultural production; in one township of Gaojiagou District in Zizhou County, semi-laborers participating in agricultural labor accounted for 35% of the total, and those going to the mountains to dig wild vegetables accounted for 85%; in one township of Wuzhuang District in Zhenchuan, all old men, women, and children, except for a few idlers, participated in farming.

　　(2) For the land left behind by migrants, in addition to the migrants finding their own representatives to entrust relatives and neighbors to cultivate on their behalf or the non-migrating farmers jointly renting the land for cultivation, the three townships have partially established temporary and reasonable usage methods for the land left behind by migrants, organizing farmers to take on cultivation. When the original owners return, the tenants will pay the original owners 20% of the produce (or a mutually agreed upon amount), or completely waive the rent. When the villages in each township are unable to take on the cultivation of the land left behind by migrants, they organize external surplus labor to collectively rush to plant. This stimulated farmers with remaining labor to take on the cultivation of land left behind by migrants.

　　(3) Based on the existing labor force, performance, and other conditions, democratically assess and grade the laborers, and distribute different goods, food, and seeds accordingly, encouraging the production enthusiasm of good laborers and overcoming the bias of evenly distributing goods, food, and seeds. On May 28th, Wuzhuang District distributed 7.7 piculs of goods and food to 162 households, and within ten days, they rushed to plant more than 600 hectares of land.

　　(4) Organize migrants to plant crops in both places. For example, some migrants rushed to plant summer fields before leaving; some worked short-term jobs outside, earned food, and then returned to production. This requires the leadership to do careful planning and organization, so as not to miss the farming season and fully utilize all possible time for production. Otherwise, there is a risk of failing in both places.

The Construction Department of the Border Region Government, based on the typical materials from the three townships, pointed out two issues that should be seriously noted in the future: First, although most of the fields have been sown this year after rushing to plant, the cultivation is rough, and with sufficient rainfall, weeds are rampant, so it is necessary to seize the opportunity to weed to avoid the crops being overgrown. Second, farmers in Suide Sub-region generally do not plant many summer fields, and the summer harvest is not enough to completely overcome the disaster. For example, summer fields in one township of Wuzhuang District, Zhenchuan County, only account for 8.4% of the total cultivated land, averaging only 0.37 hectares per person. Assuming a normal yield of 4 piculs of coarse grain per hectare, each person will receive less than 1.5 piculs. Even fewer people in one township of Gaojiawan District, Zizhou County, planted summer fields, with each person's average summer harvest being only 1 picul, and some disaster victims did not plant summer fields. Therefore, after the summer harvest, we should prevent any laxity and complacency in disaster relief and overcoming famine. We should face up to the disaster situation that continues to exist after the summer harvest and continue to fight against the disaster situation.

### 陕甘宁边区　生产救灾结合　获得成功经验

　　陕甘宁边区
  　生产救灾结合
  　获得成功经验
    【新华社西北廿五日电】陕甘宁边区政府建设厅研究了绥德分区的镇川县（新设县，米脂西北）吴庄区一乡、葭县响石区四乡、子洲县（新设县，绥德西部）高家沟区一乡三个灾重乡的典型材料后，得出了生产与救灾结合的成功经验。上述三个乡原来共有一四○二户、五六八四人，内有劳动力一二四○个。因灾荒而移民者四二五户（减少百分之三○·三），一五九九人（减少百分之二八·一），劳力五二五个（减少百分之四二·三）；三个乡的畜力，因遭胡匪抢杀及移民带走，约减少百分之七十。三个乡灾荒特重，劳动力又大量减少，粮食籽种非常困难。在此种艰苦条件下，由于干部充分掌握生产救灾结合的方针，并深入群众、具体领导，结果使三个乡原有之耕地一六四○二垧，到五月中旬已有百分之五三·五下种；此后继续播种，估计可完成百分之八七·八，其余可能荒芜的百分之一二·二，大多为坏地或远地。该三乡生产救灾经验如下：
    （一）普遍组织半劳力参加生产。在全部劳力的百分之四二·三移走后，妇女儿童的半劳力在生产中起了重大作用。如葭县响石区四乡即有一八○名妇女和一六一名儿童参加农业生产；子洲高家沟区一乡半劳力参加农业劳动者达全数之百分之三十五，上山挖菜者达百分之八十五；镇川吴庄一乡除个别二流子外，全部老汉妇女儿童均参加了耕种。
    （二）移民出走后的留地，除移民自找对象委托亲邻代耕或由未移走农民伙租耕种外，三个乡均局部地定出了移民留地的临时合理使用办法，组织农民承种。原主回来时，按产物百分之二十（或双方自愿商定）由承种户向原主交租，或完全免租。各乡本村无力承种移民留地时，则组织外部剩余劳力集体抢种。这样就刺激了劳力尚有剩余的农户纷纷承种移民留地。
    （三）根据现有劳力、动惰表现等条件，民主地评分等级，依此发放不同的货粮籽种，鼓励了好劳动者的生产情绪，克服了平均分配货粮籽种的偏向。吴庄区一乡五月二十八日给一六二户货粮七石七斗后，十天中即抢种了六百多垧地。
    （四）组织移民两头种庄稼。如有的移民抢种夏田后再走；有的在外打短工，挣了口粮再回来生产。这里须要领导上做到精密计划与组织，以期不误农时，又充分利用了一切可能的时间进行生产。否则就有两头落空的危险。
    边府建设厅根据该三个乡的典型材料，指出了今后尚应严重注意的两个问题：第一、今年经过抢种，虽大部田地均已下种，但却耕种粗糙，加以雨水充足，野草甚旺，故必须抓紧锄草，以免庄稼荒芜。第二、绥德分区一般农民种夏田不多，夏收后尚不能完全渡过灾荒。如镇川吴庄区一乡夏田仅占全部耕地百分之八·四，每人平均仅○·三七垧，以平常产量每垧粗粮四斗计算，每人所收不到一斗半。子洲高家湾区一乡种夏田者更少，每人夏收所得平均仅一斗，且有的灾民未种夏田。所以夏收后应防止任何松懈救灾渡荒的麻痹思想，应正视在夏收后仍继续存在的灾情，继续与灾情进行斗争。
