　　Criticism and Suggestions
　　Mobilizing Civilian Labor Requires Precise Calculation

　　In some counties of the Beiyue First Military Sub-district, the logistics departments and some individual units lack meticulous planning and scientific organization, wasting a lot of civilian labor. In April, the military region's × department notified the Lingqiu Logistics Department to gather 190 head of livestock to transport shoes from Donghe South to the front lines. As a result, they waited in vain for two days, wasting 380 animal laborers and civilian laborers. In May, the Lingqiu County government mobilized 200 civilian laborers and 58 head of livestock to transport grain from Gutian to Shangzhai, but because the "grain requisition slip" was managed by the grain depot personnel, 500 civilian laborers were wasted. The reasons for the waste of civilian labor, in addition to the lack of careful calculation by some waiting stations, postal stations, and military stations, and the failure to strictly abide by the provisions of the mobilization regulations; I think there are several other reasons: (1) Some cadres of the postal stations and transportation stations still do not pay attention to cherishing civilian labor, assigning too many and misusing civilian labor. (2) Civilian laborers cannot arrive at the station on time, often because someone has to urge them tightly, and the station temporarily gathers some people to send them off. After they leave, the formal civilian laborers arrive, but they are too late. (3) The district government, civilian cadres, and transportation station are not sufficiently integrated. Sometimes when the station needs service, the district cadres say, "Production is busy, there are things to do, let's go later!" Everyone is sent, which affects the completion of war tasks. It is hoped that all localities will conduct in-depth inspections and formulate effective improvement measures. (Qiè Yàolín)

　　动员民力要精确计算
    北岳一分区有些县份的后勤部门和个别部分单位，缺乏精密计划和科学的组织，浪费许多民力。四月份军区×部通知灵邱后勤部，集中一九○头牲口，由东河南往前方运鞋。结果白白的等了两天，浪费三八○个畜工和民工。五月份灵邱县政府动员民工二百个，牲畜五八头由古田向上寨运粮，因为所带“拨粮单”，粮库的人管，浪费民力五百个。造成浪费民力的原因，除某些等、政、兵站等单位事前缺乏周密的计算和没有严格地遵守动员条例的规定房间外；我想还有几个原因：（一）某些兵站、交通站干部，仍不注重爱惜民力，多派和乱用民力。（二）民工不能按时上站，常因要差人催得紧，站上临时凑些人送走，走了以后，正式民工才来，却赶不及了。（三）区政、民干部与交通站结合不够，有时站上要勤务，区干部就说“生产忙，有事情，以后再去吧！”统统派去，结果影响到战争任务的完成。希望各地作深刻检查，订出有效的改进办法。（郄耀林）
