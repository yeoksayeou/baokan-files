　　"Now I Understand"
　　——A Conversation with Li Junyao, a Businessman from Linfen
　　Ze Min
　　Mr. Li Junyao is the manager of the Dongguan Shoe Store in Linfen. In the past, he listened to the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, which said, "The Communists have twenty-four tortures and thirty-two killings, and they confiscate businesses." He was very hostile to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Linfen, through many concrete experiences, he gradually realized that the Communist Party was the savior of the people. The following is an account, in his own words, of his ideological transformation:

　　My name is Li Junyao. I run a shoe store in Dongguan. On the afternoon of April 10th, I was captured by the 66th Division and taken into the city to carry wounded soldiers. As soon as I entered the city, the People's Liberation Army attacked Dongguan. At that time, my heart was filled with pain and sorrow. I was worried about the lives of my wife and children. I was praying to Heaven that even if I lost everything, my wife and children would not be killed.

　　The next day, rumors spread throughout the city. One person said, "A certain manager was beaten to death by the 'Communist bandits.'" Another said, "The wife of a certain manager was stripped naked by the People's Liberation Army and dragged outside the city gate." I immediately fainted. I hated the Communist Party for being so cruel and for killing my wife and children alive.

　　From then on, I lived in the city at the home of Manager Niu of Maosheng Yong. On the night of May 17th, the People's Liberation Army attacked the city again. I thought this was the end. My children were dead, and I wouldn't survive either. Manager Niu and his family and I huddled together in a cellar, waiting for the People's Liberation Army to come and kill us. Who knew that the reality was not like that at all? When the People's Liberation Army came in, they were all very kind and comforting us, saying, "Villagers, you have been frightened. Don't be afraid. We are the People's Liberation Army. We are fighting for Linfen to save you." We nodded, but we dared not believe their words. We thought, you are clearly going to kill us, and you are still pretending to be good people. We suspected that the People's Liberation Army was playing some trick.

　　When it dawned, we still hadn't seen anyone come to kill us. At this time, I was so anxious that I was willing to risk my life to go home and see. But Manager Niu and his family all advised me not to go. On the third day, I couldn't bear it any longer and secretly ran home. When I entered the door, my whole family was there. I was stunned. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought I was seeing a ghost. My child saw me and shouted, "Dad is back! Dad is back!" He ran over and grabbed me. His mother probably guessed what I was thinking and smiled and said, "Come here! What are you staring at? We're not ghosts!" Then his mother told me how good the People's Liberation Army was, how they had transferred them outside the city gate, and how the government had even sent them vegetables to eat. His mother also said, "If it weren't for the People's Liberation Army helping us, we would have starved to death from lack of food." After listening to my wife's words, and remembering the comforting words of the People's Liberation Army I met in the city that day, I finally felt relieved. My wife led me around the house, and I saw that all our belongings were there, not even a single shoe was missing from the counter. I now understand that the People's Liberation Army is truly a benevolent and righteous army. I was born in Beiping, and I have been to Taiyuan and Xi'an. I have traveled all over the world and have never seen such a good army. The deceptive propaganda of the stubborn troops is only to deceive the people and make them sell their lives for them. Their false benevolence and righteousness will one day be seen through by the people of the whole country.

　　“我现在明白了”
    ——临汾商人李隽尧的谈话
    泽民
    李隽尧先生是临汾东关鞋庄的经理，过去听了蒋阎匪军欺骗宣传说：“共产党有二十四刑，三十二杀，买卖充公。”就对共产党解放军非常仇视，在临汾解放后，他从许多具体事实体验中，才逐渐认识到共产党是人民的救星。下面是他亲口说的他自己思想转变的经过：
    我名叫李隽尧，在东关开鞋庄，四月十日那天下午，被六六师抓进城里抬伤兵，刚一进城，解放军就打进了东关，那时我心里一阵疼一阵酸，担心我的老婆和孩子们的生命。当时我在求天保佑，能叫东西都丢了，也不要把我的老婆孩子们杀死。
    第二天，满城谣言，这个说：“某户经理叫‘共匪’打死了”，那个说：“某某经理的太太叫解放军把衣服脱光，拉到关外了。”我马上晕倒了，我恨共产党不该那么残忍，不该把我的老婆孩子都活活害死了。
    从此我就住在城内茂盛永牛掌柜那里。到五月十七日晚上，解放军又打进城来，我心想这可完蛋了，孩子们都死了，连我也不能活。我和牛掌柜一家人都挤在一个地洞里、等着解放军来杀我们。谁知事实并不是那样，解放军进来了都是和和气气的安慰我们说：“老乡可受惊了，不要害怕，我们是解放军，打临汾就是为了救你们。”我们一面点头，一面却不敢信他的话，心里想你们明明要杀我们，还要再装好人。怀疑着解放军不知又耍什么鬼。
    等到天明还不见有人来杀，这时候我急得拼死也要回家看看，可是牛掌柜和他家里人都劝我不要走。到第三天我再也忍不住了，就偷偷跑回家来，进门一看，一家人都在。我呆住了，我不相信我的眼，我当是活见了鬼，我的孩子看见我大喊一声，就跑来抓住我叫着：“爸爸回来了，爸爸回来了！”他妈大概已猜透了我的心思，就笑着说：“你过来吧！呆什么，我们不是鬼！”接着他妈就说起解放军怎样好，把他们转送到关外，政府还送菜食叫他们吃。他妈又说：“要不是解放军帮助咱，光没啥吃就把俺饿死了。”我听了老婆的话，又连想到那天在城里遇到的解放军安慰的话，这时才放下心来，老婆领着我在家里看了一遍，见到我们的东西都在，连柜上的鞋都没少一只。我从此明白了，解放军真是仁义之师，我生在北平，到过太原和西安，走遍天下，也没见过这样好的队伍，顽固军那样的欺骗宣传，只不过是欺哄人民，叫替他卖命罢了，假仁假义总有一天会被全国老百姓看破的。
