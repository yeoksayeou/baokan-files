　　【Taihang News】At the end of last month, cadres from the Finance Section of the Pingshun County Government inspected warehouse work in various villages and discovered many chaotic phenomena. In Wangzhuang, more than 800 jin of rice and wheat rotted due to irresponsible cadres. When Dong Anshan accepted public grain transferred from Changzhi, some of it was found to be overweight. Last year, the village casually stored 60,000 jin of grain for the military industry department, issued a storage receipt, but it has not been collected to this day, and much has rotted and deteriorated, and there are no procedures. Many military shoes have been privately exchanged or borrowed and worn, and many of the remaining ones cannot be paired. Having discovered these problems, the county government, in order to ensure that warehouses will not be damp, rot, be lost, be borrowed, or have goods left uncollected in the future, has specifically decided on the following system and measures: (1) The village head will also serve as the warehouse director, with an additional deputy director, strictly responsible for periodically inspecting stored grain in the warehouse. (2) Taking advantage of the current hot weather and the gap before weeding after the wheat harvest, thoroughly inspect and turn over the public grain for drying, and transfer any that is not in good condition. (3) The government will prepare rat poison and distribute it to various villages to protect the grain. (4) Establish an accounting system, with all income and expenditure of grain recorded in the accounts, and report it to the higher authorities once a day. (5) Strictly prohibit the random borrowing of grain and shoes stored in the warehouse.

　　平顺仓库工作有毛病
  　县府规定改善办法
    【太行讯】上月底，平顺县府财政科干部到各村检查仓库工作，发现许多混乱现象。王庄因干部不负责，有米麦八百多斤腐烂了。东安善接受长治转移过来的公粮时，竟有长了秤的。该村去年随便给军工部存粮六万斤，打了存条，至今没取走，腐脱不少，也无手续。军鞋有不少被私自换去或借穿，余下的有许多配不成双。县府发现这些问题，为了保证今后仓库不潮、不烂、不失、不借、不存，特决定以下制度与办法：（一）村长兼仓库主任，另设副主任，严格负责，按期检查仓库存粮。（二）趁现在天热与麦收后锄苗前空隙，彻底检查并翻晒公粮，选点不好的可适当转移。（三）政府准备杀鼠药分发各村，保护粮食。（四）建立帐表制度，收支粮食一律上帐，每天向上表报一次。（五）严禁乱借仓库所存粮、鞋。
