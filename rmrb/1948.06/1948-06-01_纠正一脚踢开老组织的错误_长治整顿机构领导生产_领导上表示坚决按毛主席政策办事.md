　　Correcting the Mistake of Rejecting Old Organizations
  　Changzhi Rectifies Institutions to Lead Production
    Leaders Express Determination to Act According to Chairman Mao's Policies
    [Changzhi News] Changzhi, due to left-leaning sentiments in the previous stage of democratic party rectification and the mistake of some key villages rejecting the old foundation, coupled with the concentration of most county and district cadres in key points to carry out land reform, the leadership over general village work was relaxed. This resulted in cadres becoming idle, production becoming uncontrolled, a small number of bad elements taking the opportunity to make trouble, and social order becoming chaotic, forming a state of anarchy. In March, although various districts organized spring plowing work teams to carry out work in non-key villages, due to the large number of general villages, the small number of cadres, and the many ideological problems among the masses, the problems were not well resolved. Therefore, a county-wide enlarged cadre meeting of over 800 people from various districts and villages was held from the 11th to the 14th of last month to resolve the ideological problems existing among cadres, rectify institutions, strengthen leadership, and launch this year's large-scale production campaign. After the meeting began, County Head Pang first explained Chairman Mao's party rectification policies and strictly made a self-criticism of the left-leaning adventurism committed by the leadership in this party rectification. He called on the cadres attending the meeting to say whatever they wanted and boldly raise opinions on the leadership. The cadres reflected the following: 1. Why didn't you let us know about Chairman Mao's party rectification policies? Jia Zhang, the political director of the Second District, said: "In the past, you said in branch meetings that all party members are equal, why didn't you mention a word about Chairman Mao's party rectification policies after returning from land reform study? You say it's a 'fa da gang' (legal program), we feel it's a 'fa da he' (legal river - meaning to wash away). I don't think it's that we are lying down and not working, but that you are the ones kicking us over." 2. In the past, everything we did was good and right; now, nothing we do is good or right. For example, the village chief of Yaogou Village said: "Last autumn, we increased the burden on middle peasants. We didn't agree, and the higher-ups (the district) said we didn't have a poor and lower-middle peasant viewpoint and were following the rich peasant line, and that increasing the burden on middle peasants was very good and right; now it's the opposite, very bad, very wrong, and should be corrected. It's really one order from one general, and we don't know who to listen to, who is right." 3. In the past, we were all good, praising our merits, praising our models; now, we are so bad that we are not even as good as landlords. For example, the head of the Bayi Cooperative (labor hero) said: "In the past, higher-level cadres warmly instructed us on our work when they saw village cadres, and the masses elected us as heroes and models. Now, when I find Comrade Yuan (district secretary), I don't know what we did wrong. People don't want to talk about work with us, they don't even want to look at us. Heroes have become commonplace, and models have become nonsense. Cadres are also bad and stuck. In short, cadres, heroes, and party members have all become orphans. Who still has the heart to lead the masses in production? We don't even have the energy to do our own things." 4. Leadership over general villages is relaxed or ignored. For example, the political director of Fengbei in the Fourth District said: "Last autumn, I found the district head to study the issue of increasing the burden on middle peasants in our village. The district head's secretary pushed it back four times, and finally the secretary replied: 'The district can't even take care of itself, go be self-reliant!' On the way back, I ran into the chairman of the district peasant congress and discussed the issue. People said that I was a key village cadre and didn't care about this idle matter, and then walked away. Higher-ups don't care about the work of general villages, and cadres can only lie down."
    Leaders Sincerely Self-Criticize; Village Cadres Consciously Examine Themselves
    In order to thoroughly resolve the above problems, the leadership, on the one hand, repeatedly explained Chairman Mao's policies, and on the other hand, sincerely made a public self-criticism of the leadership's biases in implementing the policies. Only then did everyone breathe a sigh of relief and begin to turn around and consciously examine themselves. For example, the village chief of Cuijiashan Village said: "We can't just blame the higher-ups, we also have our faults. In democratic party rectification, the village was kicked over by the higher-ups, and the cadres of general villages were scared by rumors. There are also those who took the opportunity to lie down and do nothing."
    After the examination, they requested that the higher-ups use two ears, on the one hand, to listen to the masses, and on the other hand, to listen to cadres and party members, to allow cadres and party members to defend themselves, to distinguish the nature of the error (for public or private purposes), and to delineate the boundaries of responsibility, with each responsible for their own. Then, the leadership repeatedly stated that they would resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's policies in the future. As a result, the morale of the cadres rose, and many people asked to talk about work, saying, "We must lead production well when we go back, otherwise we will be letting down the Party and the masses."
    Finally, County Head Pang pointed out three guidelines for the future: 1. Stabilize people's hearts, stabilize social order, rectify existing institutions, establish a new style, lead production well, and inspect the completion of sowing. 2. We must overcome the viewpoint of completing tasks for the higher-ups and establish the idea of serving the masses honestly. We must transform our work style in production. 3. All cadres must work hard in production and make contributions. As long as there are achievements, the masses will support them, and the higher-ups must also commend them, laying a good foundation for future party rectification. (County Party Committee Office)

　　纠正一脚踢开老组织的错误
  　长治整顿机构领导生产
    领导上表示坚决按毛主席政策办事
    【长治消息】长治因在前一段民主整党中存在着左倾情绪，和个别基点村犯了一脚踢开老基础的毛病，加以县区干部大部集中基点进行土改，放松了对一般村工作的领导，因此形成干部躺倒、生产自流，少数坏分子钻空捣乱，社会秩序混乱，形成无政府状态。三月间各区虽组春耕工作队开展非基点村工作，但由于一般村多，干部少，群众思想问题多，未能很好解决。因此特于上月十一日——十四日召开全县各区村八百余人扩大干部会议，解决干部存在着的思想问题，整顿机构，加强领导开展今年的大生产运动。会议开始后，首先由庞县长讲明毛主席的整党政策，把领导上在这次整党中所犯的左倾冒险主义严格的作了自我批评，号召开会干部有啥说啥，大胆提出对领导上的意见。干部反映有以下几种：一、毛主席的整党政策为什么不让我们知道？二区贾掌政治主任说：“你们过去开支部会说党员一律平等，为什么从土改学习回来，对毛主席的整党政策一字不提？你们说是法大纲，我们觉着是法大河（冲倒的意思）我认为不是我们躺倒不干，而是你们蹬倒。”二、以前做啥亦好，啥亦对；现在啥亦不好，啥亦不对。如窑沟村长说：“去秋加重中农负担，我们不同意，上级（区上）说我们没有贫雇观点，走了地富路线，加重了中农负担很好很对；现在就相反的很不好；很不对，应该纠正。真是一个将军一道令，不知听谁对，听谁好”。三、以前我们就都好，表我们的功，表我们的模；现在我们就坏的连地主都不如，如八义社长（劳英）说：“以前上级干部见了村干热情的指示工作，群众又选举当英雄模范，现在找到袁同志（区分书）不知咱有啥错，人家不给谈工作，连看亦不想看，英雄成了稀松，模范变成了扯淡，干部亦坏干住。总之干部英雄党员，都成了没娘孩，谁还有心领导群众生产，就是自己事亦没心劲干了。”四、一般村的领导放松或不管。如四区峰北的政治主任说：“去秋我村加重中农负担这问题，前几天我找区长研究，区长秘书来回推了四次，后来秘书答复：‘区上还顾不住区上，你去自力更生吧！’回到路上碰上区农代会主席，商量问题，人家说我是基点村干部，不管你这闲事，说罢扬长而去。一般村工作上级不管，干部亦只好躺倒。”
    领导上诚恳自我批评　村干自觉检讨自己
    为了把上述问题彻底解决，领导上一方面反复的说明毛主席政策，另外诚恳的把领导上执行政策的偏向当众一一作了自我批评，大家这才松了一口气，开始扭回头来，自觉的检讨自己。如崔家山村长说：“不能光怨上级，咱亦有不对，民主整党村是上级蹬倒，一般村干部听上耳旁风吓倒，还有的是趁机躺倒不干的。”
    检讨后他们要求上级要用两个耳朵，一方面要听群众话，另方面亦要听干部党员话，要允许干部党员申辩，分清错误性质（为公为私），划清责任界线，是谁的谁负责。接着领导上又一再表明今后坚决照毛主席的政策办事，因此干部情绪就高涨起来，许多人要求给谈工作，说“回去可要好好领导生产，再不领导就对不住党与群众了。”
    最后庞县长指出今后三项方针：一、安定人心稳定社会秩序，整顿现有机构，树立新的作风，好好领导生产，检查完成下种。二、我们必须克服给上级完成任务的观点，树立老老实实为群众服务思想，要在生产中改造作风。三、全体干部要好好生产立功，只要有成绩，群众亦拥护，上级亦要表扬，给将来整党打下好的基础。（县委办公室）
