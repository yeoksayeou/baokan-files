    Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office Directs:
  　Separate Good Wheat from Bad Wheat
  　Select Seeds Early to Prevent Blight
    [Taiyue News] This year, many villages in Jincheng and Gaoping have discovered wheat yellow rust and black rust diseases, reducing some of the harvest. The Taiyue District Administrative Office has specifically instructed all counties to carefully select wheat seeds to prevent disasters. In Jincheng's Xiapin and other twelve administrative villages, a total of 18,191 mu of wheat were planted, and 6,353 mu suffered from black rust, accounting for more than 30% of the total. Almost every plot of wheat in Lingdian Village has black rust and yellow rust. According to experienced farmers, poor seeds are one of the important reasons for wheat disease. The masses in Qilingdian said: "We didn't pay attention to the wheat seeds last year, and we suffered this year." Meng Fande's wheat seeds were bad, and his own nine mu all had black rust, and the wheat borrowed by Fa Rong to plant also had black rust. The Party branch secretary's wheat seeds were good, and his own planting did not get sick, and others borrowed his wheat seeds to plant and also had a good harvest. On June 14, the Fourth Administrative Office instructed all counties: for households severely affected by disasters, unable to replant, and currently relying on immersion for food, a portion of local seeds should be extracted first for relief, and banks will also provide some loans to support transportation and other sideline businesses to compensate for the insufficient harvest. On the 16th, it urgently instructed all counties to pay attention to seed selection immediately: (1) During the wheat harvest, good and bad wheat should be separated for threshing, drying, and storage, and good wheat should be selected as seed. (2) When storing grain, preparations should be made to separate good and bad wheat in a planned way. It is best to store the wheat from villages completely unaffected by disasters separately, so that the masses can borrow and exchange wheat seeds in the future. The Administrative Office is currently studying wheat seed selection and disinfection methods, and soliciting people with experience in farming to introduce wheat planting and pest control methods.

　　太岳四专署指示
  　好麦坏麦要分开
  　早选种子防疸炎
    【太岳讯】今年晋城、高平许多村庄发现小麦黄疸、黑疸病，减少若干收成。太岳区专署特指示各县慎重选择麦种，防备灾害。晋城下坪等十二个行政村共种麦一万八千一百九十一亩，遭受黑疸的有六千三百五十三亩，占总数百分之三十强。岭店村几乎每块小麦都有黑疸黄疸。据有经验的农民谈：种籽不好，是小麦患病的重要原因之一。七岭店群众说：“去年麦籽有了的咱没注意，今年吃了亏了”。孟范德的麦籽不好，自己种了九亩都有黑疸，法荣借了去种也黑疸了。支部书记的麦籽好，自己种的没有得病，别人借了他的麦籽种，也是好收成。四专署在六月十四日指示各县：对灾害严重、无力回茬和眼下浸吃的户，先抽出一部地方种子行救济，银行也将贷一部分款，扶植进行运输等副业，以补歉收之不足。十六日又紧急指示各县，马上注意选种：（一）在麦收期间，好坏麦要分开打、晒、收藏，挑选好麦做籽种。（二）屯粮时应有准备有计划的把好麦坏麦分开。最好把完全没受灾害村的麦子另行屯藏，以备将来群众借换麦籽。专署现正研究麦籽选种及消毒办法，并征求对农作有经验的人，介绍种麦和防害办法。
