Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 13th — Duan Liqing, a physics and chemistry teacher at Linfen Normal School, recently confirmed to the Linfen democratic municipal authorities the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan faction's besieged troops in Linfen in manufacturing and using poison gas. According to Duan, during the early stages of the Linfen campaign, in battles at Huangtubao No. 2 bunker (northeast of Linfen city) and other places, the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan faction's troops used up the tear gas, sneeze gas, and asphyxiant gases left behind by the Japanese invaders. Chiang's planes also failed to deliver enough poison gas and bombs. Therefore, Liang Peihuang, through the recommendation of Li Zhisan, a staff officer of the 66th Division, ordered Duan to manufacture poison gas. Li used to teach in Linfen and was a colleague of Duan, knowing that Duan had experimented with poison gas in chemistry experiments. Thus, Duan committed a serious criminal act. Duan began trial production on May 12th and produced 30 bottles of tear gas on the 15th, each bottle containing 40 watts. Liang Peihuang took them away for use that same day and another 30 bottles were made on the 16th. The method of use was to tie the bottles to hand grenades before throwing them. Each bottle had a scattering area equivalent to the explosion area of a hand grenade. This poison could remain effective for one hour. Inhaling it would cause incessant tears, coughing, and nausea. (According to our army, when attacking the city, we discovered that the enemy troops were using not only tear gas but also sneeze gas and asphyxiant gas at the breakthrough point.) On the 17th, Duan was still continuing production, but the People's Liberation Army entered the city in the morning. Duan is 57 years old and graduated from the Department of Physics and Chemistry of Beijing High Normal School. The frontline headquarters of the People's Liberation Army is investigating various evidences and preparing to organize a military court to try Liang Peihuang, Duan Liqing, and others for the crime of using and manufacturing poison gas.

　　蒋阎匪在临汾放毒
  　我已查获人证准备审判
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十三日电】临汾师范理化教员段利清，顷向临汾民主市政当局证实困守临汾蒋阎匪军制造与使用毒瓦斯的罪行。据段称：蒋阎匪军在临汾战役之初黄土堡二号碉（临汾城东北）等地战斗中，即将日寇所遗留的催泪喷嚏窒息等性毒瓦斯用尽，蒋机投送之毒气与毒弹亦感不敷，因此梁培璜即经六十六师参谋李植三推荐，下令迫段制毒。李过去也曾在临汾教书，是段的同事，知段在化学实验中试制过毒气，这样段就作了严重犯罪的行为。段于五月十二日开始试制，十五日即制成催泪性毒瓦斯三十瓶，每瓶四十瓦，当天即由梁培璜取去使用，十六日又制三十瓶。使用办法，系将瓶系在手榴弹上投弹，每瓶散发面积相当于手榴弹爆炸面积，此毒能在一小时内保持有效，吸入此毒时就要流泪不止、咳嗽作呕，（按我军攻城时，在突破口发觉匪军施放的毒气、除催泪瓦斯外，还有喷嚏瓦斯与窒息瓦斯）。十七日段尚在续制，但解放军早上就进城了。段现年五十七岁，毕业于北平高师理化系，人民解放军前线司令部，正调查各种证据，准备组织军事法庭，审判梁培璜段利清等使用与制造毒气的罪行。
