　　Taihang A Certain Fourth Detachment of a Taihang Regiment
  　Helps Harvest 130 Mu in One Day
    [Anyang News] After the mobilization for the wheat harvest, the Fourth Detachment of a certain regiment of the Taihang Fifth Military Subdistrict, after deliberation and discussion, recognized two problems: (1) Grain is the lifeline of the military and civilians; (2) Grain is the guarantee of victory in the war. Immediately, a campaign to protect the wheat harvest and help with harvesting, as well as to kill enemies and perform meritorious service, was launched. Soldiers spontaneously put forward competitions between individuals and between platoons. As soon as the wheat harvest began, all 120-plus members of the detachment automatically participated in helping with the harvest, some cutting, some carrying, some threshing. Comrades Chang Xueqing and three others from the Second Platoon, upon returning from sentry duty, did not take a nap and automatically went to help with the harvest. Comrade Ma Jinde, deputy platoon leader of the Fifth Platoon, despite suffering from malaria, also actively participated. On the 4th alone, they harvested 130 mu of wheat, most of which was carried back to the threshing ground for the masses. In addition, they helped the masses with threshing more than ten times. They also universally carried out propaganda work during the harvest, breaking the masses' 麻痹(numbness) regarding the wheat harvest. (Yang Xianzong)

　　太行某团四分队
  　一天助收百三十亩
    【安阳消息】太行五分区五二部队某团四分队，在麦收动员后，经过酝酿讨论，都认识了两个问题：（一）粮食是军民的命根；（二）粮食是战争胜利的保证。随即开展了保麦助收和杀敌立功运动，战士们自发的个人与个人，班与班提出了竞赛。麦收刚开始，全队一百二十余人自动参加了助收，有的割，有的挑，有的打场。二班常学青等四同志，放哨回来不午睡，自动去助收，五班副班长马金德同志，身患虐疾，也积极去参加。仅四号一天，即割麦子一百三十亩，大部将麦子给群众担回场来。此外，还帮群众打场十余次。并在收割中普遍的开展了宣传工作，打破群众对麦收的麻痹思想。（杨宪宗）
