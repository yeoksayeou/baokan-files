Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS reports: The Soviet "Bolshevik" magazine recently wrote, in discussing the growing strength of the anti-imperialist camp worldwide: Recent developments in the international situation prove the correctness of Zhdanov's conclusions in his report on the international situation at the conference of representatives of nine communist parties last year, and the correctness of the resolutions of that conference. The magazine pointed out: The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the economic and cultural fields, and the increase in its international prestige, signify the growth and consolidation of the anti-imperialist camp. The magazine then pointed out the growth of socialist and democratic forces in the new democratic countries. In Poland, the political line of the Polish Workers' Party, which aims to establish a unified working-class party, has received an enthusiastic response from the Polish working class. The agreement between the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party is a decisive factor in opposing the reactionaries and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. It also influences the youth movement, encourages cooperation among democratic parties, and strengthens the influence on the Polish Trade Union Federation, which has about three million members. In Czechoslovakia, the February events proved that the democratic forces have won a decisive victory in the struggle against the reactionaries. The Czechoslovak Communist Party is the largest, most powerful, and most trusted party by the people in the country. In Romania, the National Assembly elections gave the People's Democratic Front a major victory. The merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party into a party of the Romanian working class is a major achievement of Romanian democracy. A year ago, the reactionaries in Hungary were still quite powerful; but last year, the democratic forces dealt a devastating blow to the reactionaries, and are now finally driving them out of the country and government institutions. The Hungarian Communist Party has become even stronger. The working people of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania have also made further achievements in political and economic development. The magazine also pointed out that the countries of Western Europe are also strengthening and consolidating democratic forces, and stepping up the struggle against the reactionaries. The continuous increase in the number of members of the French Communist Party proves the party's growing prestige among the broad masses of the French people. In January 1948 alone, there were more than 5,000 new members in the Seine province. The Italian democratic camp, led by the Italian Communist Party, also constitutes a powerful political force. Since the election, more than 7,000 workers and farmers have joined the Communist Party. The struggle of the Chinese working people has entered a new stage. The democratic movements in Germany, Austria, Britain, the United States, and other countries, as well as in the Far East and various democratic and dependent countries, are all unfolding extensively. The number of members of communist and labor parties in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe has reached six million. The Italian Communist Party has 2.28 million members; the Chinese Communist Party has 2.7 million members; and the French Communist Party has nearly one million members. The strength and scale of the trade union, women's, and youth democratic movements are also constantly increasing. The magazine concluded: This forms the astonishing strength of the democratic camp. The democratic camp is taking the offensive everywhere; the democratic and socialist forces are on the rise.

　　反帝阵营日益壮大
  　“布尔什维克”杂志评论
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联“布尔什维克”杂志最近在论述全世界反帝阵营日益壮大的情景时写道：最近国际形势的发展，证明了日丹诺夫去年在九国共产党代表会议上关于国际形势报告的结论和该代表会议决议的正确性。该杂志指出：苏联在经济和文化方面的伟大成就及其国际威信的提高，意味着反帝阵营力量的增涨和巩固。该杂志继而指出新民主主义国家的社会主义力量和民主力量的壮大。在波兰，旨在建立统一工人阶级政党的波兰工人党的政治路线，得到波兰工人阶级的热烈响应。波兰工人党和波兰社会党的协议，是反对反动派和加强工农联盟的决定因素。它同时也影响青年运动，鼓励各民主党派的合作，并加强了对拥有约三百万会员的波兰职工联合会的影响。在捷克，二月事件证明：民主力量在和反动派的斗争中，已获得决定性的胜利。捷克共产党是全国最大、最有力量和为人民群众完全信赖的党。在罗马尼亚，国民议会的选举，使人民民主阵线获得重大胜利。共产党和社会民主党合并为一个罗马尼亚工人阶级的政党，是罗马尼亚民主的主要成就。在一年以前，匈牙利的反动派还相当得势；但在去年，民主力量给了反动派以毁灭性的打击，现在正最后地把他们驱逐出国家和政府机构。匈牙利共产党已更加强大。保加利亚、南斯拉夫和阿尔巴尼亚各国的劳动人民，在政治和经济发展中也获得进一步的成就。该杂志又指出：西欧各国也在加强和巩固民主力量，加紧反对反动派的斗争。法国共产党人数的不断增加，证明了该党在法国广大人民中日益增高的威信。一九四八年一月，仅塞纳省就有五千多新党员入党。以意大利共产党为首的意国民主阵营，也构成了势力雄厚的政治力量。自选举以来，已有七千多工人农民加入共产党。中国劳动人民的斗争已进入新阶段。德、奥、英、美等和远东各国以及各国民主和附属国的民主运动都正在广泛展开。东欧新民主主义国家内共产党和劳动阶级政党的人数已有六百万名。意大利共产党有二百二十八万人；中国共产党有二百七十万人；法国共产党有将近一百万人。职工会、妇女和青年的民主运动的力量和规模，也在不断的增涨中。该杂志结语说：这就形成了民主阵营的惊人力量。民主阵营到处都采取攻势；民主主义的和社会主义力量是在上升中。
