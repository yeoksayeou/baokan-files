【Taihang News】 After more than half a month of intense struggle to protect wheat in the Yubei border areas, the harvesting stage has been successfully completed in most areas, and is now transitioning to the threshing stage. In the Fourth Military Sub-district, Jiaozuo has harvested over 80% of its wheat, and in Xiuwu, over 30 villages had harvested more than 47,000 mu by the end of May. Bo'ai, Xiuwu, and other counties have also largely completed their harvesting. In the Fifth Military Sub-district, the five border districts of Anyang had mostly completed their harvest by the 5th of this month, and many villages in Ye County, Tangyin, and Ji County had largely completed their harvesting. During the wheat protection struggle, our local armed forces, guerrilla groups, and militia actively attacked everywhere, going deep into enemy territory and the grid network near enemy strongholds, actively protecting the masses' harvesting efforts. In the seventeen days of attacks and blocking actions, nearly a thousand Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local reactionaries were annihilated. The main reasons for achieving the above victory in the first stage are: (1) Overcoming and correcting "leftist" errors, rectifying policies, and carrying forward the tradition of unity against the enemy from the Anti-Japanese War. At the cadre expansion meetings and training sessions for village cadres and militia in various counties, one-sided viewpoints of favoring poor and hired peasants were reviewed and criticized from top to bottom, and the "leftist" errors of harming and excluding middle peasants and indiscriminate beatings and killings began to be corrected. The confused thinking of cadres at all levels was systematically clarified, and then, closely combined with the wheat protection struggle, deviations were corrected in a differentiated and step-by-step manner. For example, in Nan Shijian and eight other villages in the Fifth District of Bo'ai, over 100 mu of land and 15 livestock were used to compensate more than 30 poor peasant households who had been wrongly struggled against, and more than 10 landlord households were resettled. During the militia rectification in Qi County, the errors of excluding middle peasants in the organization and care of militia family members were corrected. Village cadres and militia began to become active, and middle and poor peasants became more united. Landlords also appreciated our magnanimity. The masses' enthusiasm for protecting wheat was extremely high, and they voluntarily organized mutual aid. Some villages automatically expanded their militia. In a village in Anyang, the masses requested the establishment of a militia company. In the Second District of Ye County, seven youths who had escaped persecution under Chiang Kai-shek bandits requested to be given weapons to fight back. Various localities organized armed forces to go deep into Chiang-occupied areas to carry out political offensives, widely publicizing our policies towards all classes and exposing the enemy's deceptive propaganda. As a result of implementing the correction of "leftist" policies, large numbers of people who had fled to Chiang-occupied areas returned to their hometowns. In Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, and the First District of Xiuwu, more than 700 fleeing households were persuaded to return home in six days. Those who could not make a living were resettled by the villages. Armed forces penetrating into Chiang-occupied areas, combined with political offensives, disintegrated and destroyed many of the enemy's village-level organizations. The militia work teams of the Fourth District of Xiuwu, Huojia, and the Third District of Jiaozuo captured more than 80 people, including the head of the puppet self-defense corps. Except for one or two who had killed people and raped women and were hated by the masses, and were sent to the democratic government for prosecution and trial according to law, the rest were released after education. (2) Through the "three check-ups" study and ideological rectification, the morale of our local military groups, local armed forces, and militia has greatly increased. Under the slogan of "strike first," they have actively launched attacks and blockades, and carried out a competition to kill the enemy, protect wheat, and make meritorious contributions, thwarting the enemy's attempts to establish temporary strongholds and大規模抢麦. Yang Juhe's model work team, which grew up in the First District of Jiaozuo and was famous in the Taihang area during the Anti-Japanese War, created a model case of achieving two victories in one day, annihilating more than 20 enemies. The joint defense militia and rotation teams of the Eighth District of Bo'ai combined sparrow warfare with explosives to ambush large-scale invasions by Chiang Kai-shek bandits twice, achieving complete victories with scores of zero to twenty and zero to eighteen. Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi have all launched mass explosion movements. The Fourth District of Xiuwu has also set up minefields, killing or wounding 17 enemies in six days. On June 2nd, our "Zhuzhuang" guerrilla group in Jiaozuo set up three lines of landmines, using machine guns and rifles to repel the invasion of more than 500 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Dai Wang and Zhou Liu, eliminating a total of 38 enemies and crushing the enemy's conspiracy to set up temporary wheat grabbing strongholds in Jincun and Xin'anzhen. The local armed "64" unit, in conjunction with the Second Detachment of the Qin River, repelled a three-pronged attack by 2,000 enemy bandits from Mulan Village in the Zhongfeng area of Xiuwu and Huojia on the 3rd of this month, killing, wounding, and capturing 44 puppet security regiment commanders and company commanders. In the seventeen-day food protection battle from the 19th of last month to the 4th of this month, there were more than 50 battles, large and small, in which 637 people, including Li Tianzuo, deputy commander of the 3rd Regiment of the puppet Henan Provincial Security Brigade, and Wang Delin, a local bandit chief in northern Henan, were killed or wounded. 341 bandits below the deputy battalion commander were captured alive, totaling 988 people. One stronghold was recovered, 15 bunkers were destroyed, 7 light machine guns, 1 submachine gun, 753 rifles and carbines, 23 short guns, and more than 9,200 rounds of ammunition were seized. (3) Mobilizing and organizing all forces of the Party, government, army, and people to fully participate in the wheat protection struggle. Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi counties in the Fourth Military Sub-district organized the Qinbei Joint Command, and all counties universally strengthened militia joint defense, established county, district, and village commands or wheat protection committees, and unified leadership over the wheat protection struggle. At the same time, the broad masses were mobilized to organize temporary large-scale mutual aid harvesting. In areas contested by the enemy and us, labor-military combined harvesting organizations were formed. In many places, the armed forces held guns in one hand and sickles in the other, actively protecting and helping the local masses to harvest. The Yingbing and "52" units in Tangyin and other five counties helped the masses in 25 villages harvest more than 3,100 mu of wheat. The border counties have now begun to transition into a more acute, intense, and sustained wheat protection struggle.
