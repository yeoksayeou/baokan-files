　　Gaoling Fully Engages in Production for Self-Relief, Overcoming Chiang's Disaster and Surviving the Spring Famine
　　[Our dispatch] Gaoling County, located in the border area of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, is frequently disturbed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and returning local despots, who engage in harassment, arson, and murder. From December of last year, Chiang's bandits used the entire 40th Division and its local forces to specifically harass the area for more than two months. Of the forty-plus villages in the Second District, only five small villages were not affected by the enemy's disaster; more than thirty villages in the First District suffered from the enemy's disaster. Many villages were robbed multiple times by Chiang's bandits. In Houwei Village in the Second District, all sixty-eight head of livestock were stolen, one hundred and ninety-two pots of all sizes were smashed, eighteen houses were burned down, and six people were killed. The villages of Daliu and Weiwan also suffered losses of fifty to sixty head of livestock. Statistics from seven villages in the First District show that one hundred and seventy-nine head of livestock were stolen. Many people were displaced and unable to make a living. In addition to providing disaster relief to the victims at any time, the democratic government also issued huge loans of 155 million yuan and 292,500 jin of food during the spring plowing period to support men in spring plowing and women in textile production for self-relief. According to statistics from Jingdianji alone, in the twenty days from April 25th to May 15th, the masses in four districts purchased 332 head of livestock from the area for spring plowing. As a result, in addition to the complete sowing of general cultivated land, most of the wasteland was also eliminated. According to statistics from ten villages in the Fourth District, of the original 470.99 mu of wasteland, 413.9 mu have been sown. With the encouragement of the Industry and Commerce Bureau to merchants for free trading and public orders, women's textile production yielded a total of 19,867 bolts of cloth, generating a total profit of 111.702 million yuan. During agricultural leisure, the democratic government also organized the masses for transportation. In the forty-five days from early April to May 15th alone, the masses earned more than 31.83 million Jibi yuan and 522,556 jin of grain. According to current statistics, this spring, with the support of the democratic government, the people of Gaoling County have not only engaged in farming but also benefited from textile production, transportation, fishing, and alkali boiling, earning a total profit of over 421.7 million yuan. This has not only overcome the spring famine caused by Chiang's bandits but has also laid the material foundation for getting rich, building up strength, and supporting the People's War.
