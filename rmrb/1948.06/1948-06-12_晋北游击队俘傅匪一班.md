Xinhua News Agency, JinSui, 9th. A platoon from the enemy's 19th Security Regiment in Datong was captured while looting grain. On May 26th, led by platoon leader Zhu Zihua, the platoon sneaked into the northwest area of Datong to loot grain. They were immediately surrounded by our guerrilla force. After our guerrilla fighters called out to them, all fourteen men in the platoon automatically laid down their weapons and handed over one light machine gun and nine rifles. According to Zhu Zihua and others, the platoon was composed of remnants of Fu Zuoyi's bandit forces under Zhu Qimei, who were annihilated by us this spring in Fugou. They fled south to Datong via Suinan, where they suffered discrimination and abuse from Yan Xishan's troops.
