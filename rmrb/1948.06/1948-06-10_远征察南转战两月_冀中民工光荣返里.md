Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 7th: Laborers from Ding County, Anping, Shenze, Xinle, and Anguo counties in central Hebei, who followed the army on an expedition to Chahar South, traversing thousands of miles and lasting over two months, have now completed their tasks and returned home in glory. During this support-the-front expedition, the laborers, under the slogan of "Love the soldiers, love the people," completed many arduous war service tasks such as rescuing the wounded, and maintained excellent discipline. During the Xiaoying battle in Chahar South, they rushed to the front lines to rescue the wounded amidst flying shells and dense smoke. To get off the front lines, they had to pass over a mile-long bridge, where shells were exploding on both sides and three airplanes were bombing and strafing. They first concealed the wounded and then bravely rushed across the bridge during lulls in the bombing, ensuring the safe transfer of fifty-three wounded soldiers. During the Hutuo River Shop battle, they transported the wounded in heavy rain, traveling back and forth one hundred and thirty *li* (approx. 65 kilometers). Their clothes were soaked, but they never complained. When crossing the Sanggan River at night, the water was cold and the current swift. Peng Hushan, the leader of the laborers, jumped into the water nine times to rescue those who had been swept away. The laborers loved the wounded soldiers. They not only lifted and placed them gently, fed them, and disposed of their waste, but also donated over 1.4 million *bianbi* (border currency) to buy cigarettes, snacks, and other items to comfort the wounded. During lulls in the fighting, they also helped the local people in the war zone with production, informing them of the life and victories in the old liberated areas. Laborers from Anguo and six other counties helped with production by hauling 36,465 loads of manure, weeding 763 *mu* (approx. 51 hectares), plowing 103 *mu*, and cutting 8,725 *jin* (approx. 4362.5 kilograms) of firewood, carrying 25,904 loads of water. They also helped with spinning thread, weaving baskets, making pen cushions, and building walls, but the statistics for these tasks have not yet been compiled. Laborers from various counties have universally launched emulation campaigns, mutually guaranteeing that they would not abandon a single wounded soldier under any circumstances, would not violate mass discipline, would "love the soldiers and love the people," and would constantly "share their thoughts" to raise awareness, maintaining consistently high morale. Over two months, 628 heroes, both large and small, emerged, as well as model units such as the Sixth Company (Zhao Manquan Platoon), a comprehensive model unit from Anping. Upon their return, the front-line troops held a special farewell meeting, giving each laborer 6,000 *bianbi* in consolation money and presenting them with six silk banners with inscriptions such as "Expedition to the Border, Hero of Support" and one machine gun and 115 rifles. In other news, the North Yue Fourth Military Sub-district People's Armed Forces Department has decided to train 400 support-the-front cadres above the platoon level. The first and second phases of training for laborer platoon-level cadres, namely current village cadres and civilian cadres, are underway. The first phase of 100 people has graduated, and the second phase has also begun. The curriculum includes stretcher knowledge, marching, camping, demolition, earthwork, grenade throwing, shooting, as well as political work, discipline, life management, and more.
