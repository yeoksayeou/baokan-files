Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: To develop agricultural and pastoral production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and to raise the labor enthusiasm and initiative of farmers and herdsmen, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government recently jointly issued a notice on determining land rights and developing agricultural and pastoral production. The notice stipulates that in agricultural areas where land has already been equally distributed, land rights will be confirmed. Poor, hired, and middle peasants, as well as wealthy peasants and landlords who have received land, will all have land ownership rights. Once land licenses are prepared, they will be formally issued. Those who work diligently and cultivate effectively, exceeding normal yields, will be rewarded by the government. Those who newly cultivate barren land or cultivate fallow land for more than one year will be exempt from agricultural tax in the first year, two-thirds exempt in the second year, and one-third exempt in the third year. It is also stipulated that the reclaimed land belongs to the reclaimers.

To encourage rural animal husbandry and sideline occupations in agricultural areas and the development of animal husbandry in pastoral areas, it is stipulated that those engaged in animal husbandry, whether as a primary or secondary occupation, who achieve success in livestock breeding through improved breeds, improved epidemic prevention, and animal husbandry methods will be rewarded and commended. Draft animals in agricultural areas directly used for agricultural production will not be subject to livestock tax when agricultural tax is collected in the autumn. Those used for sideline production will be subject to livestock tax rationally. The method of collecting taxes on four livestock based on the yield of one "qing" of land from last year will be abolished. Newly bred young livestock this year will be exempt from livestock tax. Measures will be implemented to protect livestock, prohibit the killing of draft animals and female animals, and prohibit the dispersion of herds to avoid affecting livestock breeding. Violators will be punished. The notice calls on all farmers and herdsmen to actively organize to develop production, improve their lives, and increase the wealth of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to more powerfully support the war.

　　内蒙奖励发展生产
    确定地权税收制度
    【新华社东北二十八日电】中共内蒙党委及内蒙自治政府为发展内蒙自治区农牧生产，提高农牧民劳动热情和积极性，最近联合颁发确定地权发展农牧生产通告，规定凡农业区土地已平分的地方，即实行确定地权，分得土地的贫雇中农及富农地主，均有土地所有权，一俟土地执照制就后，即正式颁发地照。凡勤劳生产，耕作得法超过通常产量者，由政府予以奖励，增开生荒或开一年以上的热荒者，第一年免征公粮，第二年免征三分之二，第三年免征三分之一，并确定所开荒地属于开荒人所有。为奖励农业地区农村畜牧副业与畜牧地区发展牧畜，规定凡经营牧畜者，无论属于主业或副业，由于改良畜种改进防疫及牧畜方法，使畜牧繁殖获有成绩者，予以奖励和表扬。凡农业地区直接用于农业生产之畜力，秋后征收公粮时，不征收其牲畜税，其属于副业生产部分者，另按牲畜税合理征收，废除去年四头牲畜按一垧地产量征收办法。本年繁殖的幼畜征收牲畜税时，一律免征。实行保护牲畜，禁杀耕畜和母畜，禁止分散畜群，以免影响牲畜繁殖，违者予以处罚。通告号召全体农牧人民积极组织起来发展生产，改善生活，增加内蒙自治区财富，做到更有力的支援战争。
