[Chahar News] The farmers of Xuanhua County have high enthusiasm for production. Although some border areas are in a state of acute struggle against the enemy and intense support for the front, the masses have seized the lulls in the war to complete spring planting. Some areas still have some late wheat and millet that have not been planted, but grain, sorghum, and beans have all been planted, with a sown area accounting for 80% of the total cultivated area of the county. Villages along the Sanggan River have planted large amounts of hemp and wheat, and wheat seedlings have been hoed once. In terms of water conservancy construction, canal repair and excavation work has been carried out. There are a total of 17 new and old canals in the county, which can irrigate 8,680 mu of land. Wangjiawan in the first district actively sought ways to improve waterlogged land and borrowed 12 million yuan to build a large canal capable of irrigating more than 400 mu of land. The Qianjiahewa canal in the twelfth district was not well repaired when the Fu bandits invaded because the masses were afraid of being conscripted. This year, it was completed during the lull when our army attacked Huashaoying. The Changshun Canal in the tenth district can irrigate more than ten qing of land and has now been repaired. Some progress has also been made in eliminating wasteland. The third district has eliminated 483 mu of cultivated wasteland, and the fourth district has eliminated 177 mu. After our army liberated Yuxianchuan, some of the masses who had fled to the guerrilla areas last year returned home to farm. Young farmers in Chuanxia, tenth district, fled to Huangyang Mountain in the third district to avoid being conscripted by the Fu bandits and reclaimed wasteland on the mountain to plant yams. The eleventh district eliminated 1,066 mu of wasteland and opened up 783 mu of new wasteland. Qianjialing Village eliminated 450 mu of wasteland, and Sunjiagou eliminated 200 mu. With the support of loans from the democratic government, the number of livestock has increased. The first district bought seven heads of livestock, Wayaogou Village in the third district bought three donkeys, the eleventh district bought eight, and also bought fifty sheep.
