Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 21st: According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: In late May and early June, students in Peiping and Shanghai continued to bravely resist the persecution by the reactionaries. The Student Self-Government Association of Peking University in Peiping passed a resolution on May 27th to unite with all universities and colleges across the country to oppose the Chiang government's establishment of a "Special Criminal Court" to persecute patriotic and democratic students; they refused to send the university's students Deng Te (Deng was arrested in February and is currently on medical bail due to illness) and Meng Xiangong (Meng was arrested in September of last year and is still detained in the Hebei Court Detention Center) to the Special Criminal Court for trial; if forced arrests are made, students will take legitimate defense measures, etc. Furthermore, on the 27th of last month, the Peiping Garrison Headquarters arrested Ma Xitian, a student of the Sino-French University, which has already triggered a class boycott by the university's students in protest. The university's Student Self-Government Association, together with representatives from six universities including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, North China University, Railway Institute, and Teachers College, went to the Garrison Headquarters on June 1st to petition for his release; and held a general student assembly on the 2nd to discuss continuing the rescue efforts. Railway Institute students boycotted classes for one day on May 27th to protest the assault and humiliation of Zheng Zuhua, chairman of the supervisory committee of the school's student self-government association, and the school's favoritism towards secret agent students; and issued a declaration demanding that the school expel the secret agent students to ensure student safety. Zhang Fuzhen and Wang Kaijiang, students of Chaoyang College, were brutally beaten by six secret agents on the street during the day on May 22nd, with multiple head injuries and wounds all over their bodies. In response, the school's students boycotted classes for one day on May 25th and went to the Garrison Headquarters and the police station to petition, demanding that the murderers be handed over. In other news: Shanghai Jiaotong University students boycotted classes on May 18th and 19th to protest the arrest of five students including Zhang Liangcai, and established a rescue committee, requesting Shanghai Kuomintang Mayor Wu Guozhen to immediately release them twice.
