　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Berlin dispatch: The atrocities of the US and French occupation authorities in Germany in interfering with the signature campaign for "German People Demand National Unification" have aroused protests from the Soviet occupation authorities. At the four-power commanders' assistants meeting held on May 25th, Soviet representative Colonel Yerichalov pointed out that Germans in Kreuzburg (US occupation zone) who collected signatures for petitions demanding German unification were forcibly escorted to the US military police, where they were warned that they would be punished if they did not abandon their activities in support of German unification. In Sonneberg, US police distributed leaflets saying that anyone who signed the petition was signing his own arrest warrant. In the Bukou area, a large number of US police officers participated in the search operation with police dogs. The same situation also occurred in the French occupation zone. Yerichalov demanded that such persecution be stopped and questioned the US and French representatives: Is it tolerable in the twentieth century to use police dogs to hunt down people simply because they are pursuing a unified Germany and just peace?

　　德境美法占领当局干涉德国统一运动
    【新华社陕北一日电】柏林讯：美法占领当局干涉“德国人民要求国家统一”签名运动的暴行，已引起苏联占领当局的抗议。在五月二十五日举行的四强司令官助理会议上，苏代表耶理查罗夫上校指出：那些在克列乌兹堡（美占区）收集要求德国统一请愿书签名的德国人，被武装压送到美国军事警察处，并在该处受到警告，如果不放弃拥护德国统一的活动，就要受处罚。在索恩涅堡，美国警察散发传单说：凡参加请愿书签名的人，就是签署他自己的拘票。在布口地方，大批美国警察带着警犬参与这一搜捕行动。同样的情形，也发生在法占区。耶氏要求停止这种迫害行为，并质问美法代表道：在二十世纪，只因为追求统一的德国和正义和平，便用警犬来追捕他们，是能够容忍的吗？
