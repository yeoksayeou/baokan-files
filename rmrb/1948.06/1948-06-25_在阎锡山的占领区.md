　　In Yan Xishan's Occupied Area
　　The No-Man's-Land Created by Yan's Bandits
　　Yan Xishan wants to expand his occupied "points" into "areas," forcing the people in Yan's occupied areas near the liberated areas to leave their homes and create a "no-man's-land." On the border of Shouyang and Yuci counties, tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes and wander around; many have come to the liberated areas, some have been captured and forced to work as coolies for Yan's bandits in Hanshan, and some have died of cold and starvation in the mountains. More than 800 people died of cold, starvation, or suicide in Duan Wangye. The people of Yequepo were driven out, and the bandit leaders looted all the doors, windows, furniture, property, and livestock. The only 40 houses left were eventually burned to the ground. Now, on the border from Meng County to Shouyang, no chickens crow, no dogs bark, the land is barren, the fruit trees are frozen to death, and the courtyards and streets are piled with broken bricks and tiles, a desolate scene. This is the "no-man's-land" created by Yan Xishan.
　　Rampant Taxes and Levies
　　Yan's bandits are truly innovative in creating new ways to collect donations and taxes. In addition to the collection of public grain, there are also military service bonus fees, troop comfort fees, equipment fees, office fees, food fees, allowance fees, newspaper fees, cadre training fees, entertainment fees, local comfort fees, central education fees, work fees, guarding fees, salary fees, cadre food and lodging fees, and meal distribution fees. In Dadongzhuang Village, Shouyang and Yuci counties, the total grain collected by the whole village is 96,000 jin, of which 86,036 jin are looted by Yan's bandits every year. Zhu Changwei, a villager, harvests a total of 1,200 jin of miscellaneous grains a year, but has to pay 1,057 jin of public grain and 128 jin for village expenses, leaving him with only 15 jin for the year. Zhu Daoju only produces 280 jin of miscellaneous grains a year, but Yan's family insists on 706 jin of public grain and 39 jin for village burden grain, forcing him to hand over all his grain and sell his 14-year-old daughter, which is still not enough to pay the burden. Li Sunshi and Zhu Baoen's wives were both forced to remarry because they could not afford to pay the public grain. Last year, when Dongzhuang harvested the autumn crops, Yan's bandits started to take the grain in the fields, taking a little at a time until it was all gone. Now, in this area, even middle-income families can only afford to eat vegetable gruel, which is considered a good meal. In Zong'ai and Xiebei areas of Shouyang, last year's grain was looted in the fields long ago. This year, they are forcing each tael of grain silver to be exchanged for 1.7 shi of wheat, and each mu of land to be exchanged for 0.6 dou of rice. Recently, they have also forced the people to take photos and wear "National Certificates." Anyone who does not take a photo will be treated as a "disguised element." In Xiechou Village, more than 32 million yuan was extorted in photo fees in just two days. Recently, the people of Shouyang have been spreading a few words to describe the atrocities of Yan's bandits: "The Second War Zone (referring to Yan's bandits) demands grain so cruelly, regardless of the life or death of the people. They dig caves and search everywhere. If you say you don't have it, they will torture you. First they demand, then they rob, then they hang you up and beat you. Only if you hand over the grain will they let you go."
　　"Self-Confession and Rebirth"
　　In order to destroy all resistance psychology and actions of the people, Yan's bandits are carrying out a "self-confession and rebirth" movement. In places that have changed hands between us and the bandits several times, and are still occupied by Yan's bandits today, all those who are unwilling to be slaves are forced to "confess." If you say something, and they say you haven't told everything, they will beat you to death with sticks, then put you in a coffin. If you come back to life, they call it "rebirth." If someone reports something else about you, you will "die" again. In Zong'ai, Yan's bandits killed more than 200 people in this way and threw them into the well outside Xige. The local villagers are spreading a saying: "When a person is upright, their shadow is crooked, they tell you to confess. If you can't say what's long or short, they will beat you with sticks, and you will soon be on the road to death."
　　Attacking Yan's Bandits
　　Blitz Plowing and Sowing
　　Many people in the Yan-occupied areas of Yuci and Shouyang have been forced to flee from famine. More than 38,000 people have fled to the liberated areas to seek refuge. This spring, under the slogan of "restoring our positions and insisting on production," we have organized these people, leaving a small number to produce in Pingding, Meng County, Yangquan and other places, and mobilizing more than 30,000 people to return to their villages to cultivate the land. Our armed work teams have gone deep into the Yan-occupied areas, protecting and assisting the masses in cultivation on the one hand, and carrying out propaganda against the enemy on the other. The masses and armed work teams in Yanjiaping, Shouyang County, fought while producing. They fought seven times in nine days. The masses adopted the method of resting in the mountain gullies during the day and dividing up the tasks of guarding and producing at night, and successfully completed the production tasks. Under the cover of our militia and armed work teams, the masses in Sanzhuang, Kuozi Tou, and other nine villages rushed to plant and cultivate more than 3,000 mu of land in 25 days.

### 在阎锡山的占领区

　　在阎锡山的占领区
　　阎匪制造的无人区
    阎锡山想把他占领的“点”扩大为“面”，强迫靠近解放区的阎占区人民离开家乡，造成一道“无人区”。在寿（阳）榆（次）边境，就有数万人民被迫离乡背景，到处流浪；有很多来到了解放区，有些被抓到罕山给阎匪做苦工，有的流落山沟冻饿而死。段王爷冻死饿死和自杀的有八百多人。野雀坡的老百姓被赶出去了，匪首把门窗、家具、财物、牲畜抢劫一空，仅留的四十间房子，最后也一火烧尽。现在盂县到寿阳的边境，村村鸡不鸣、狗不叫，土地荒芜了，果木冻死了，房院街道堆满了破砖碎瓦，一片荒凉，这就是阎锡山制造的“无人区”
　　横征暴＠
    阎匪创造收捐税名目真是花样翻新。除征收公粮外，还有兵务奖金费，慰劳军费，设备费，办公费，菜金费，津贴费，报费，干部训练费，请客费，地方慰劳费，中心教育费工作工费，守岗费，薪金费，干部食宿费，派饭费等名目。寿（阳）榆（次）县大东庄，全村总收粮九万六千斤，每年要被阎匪抢去八万六千零三十六斤。村民朱昌维一年总收杂粮一千二百斤，就要负担公粮一千零五十七斤和村开支一百二十八斤，一年所得只剩十五斤。朱道居全年仅产杂粮二百八十斤，阎家硬要公粮七百零六斤、村负担粮三十九斤，迫的他交了全部粮食，又卖了十四岁的亲生女，但还不够交负担。李孙氏和朱保恩的女人，都是因交不起公粮被迫改嫁的。东庄去年收秋时，阎匪在场里起粮，打一点装一点，打完了也就装完了。现在这一带中农以上的家庭，能吃上菜糊糊的就是好饭。寿阳的宗艾，解悲等地，去年的粮食早被在场里抢光了，今年又让每两粮银出一石七斗麦子，每亩地出六斗米；最近又迫令老百姓照像，佩带“国民证”，谁不照像按“伪装分子”论罪。解愁一村，两天就被剥夺照像费三千二百多万元。寿阳人民最近流传着几句话描述阎匪暴行：“二战区（指阎匪）要粮真残忍，不管百姓死和生，挖窑挖洞乱搜寻，说个没有就动刑；先要后抢再吊打，荷（拿）上粮食就能行”。
　　“自白转生”
    阎匪为了摧毁人民的一切反抗心理和行动，进行了一切“自白转生”运动，在我与匪数度易手，今天尚为阎匪盘踞的地方，强迫一切不愿作奴隶的人都得“自白”；你说了一些，他说没有谈全，就用乱棍打死，然后放在棺材里，如活了就叫“转生”，再有人报告他一些什么还得“转死”。阎匪在宗艾用这种方法杀死后推在西阁外井里的，就有二百多人。当地老乡传流着一句话：“人正影儿歪，叫你自白；说不出长和短，乱棍就打起来，霎时上了望乡台”。
　　打击阎匪
  　突击耕种
    榆（次）寿（阳）阎占区很多人被迫逃荒在外，只逃来找解放区的就有三万八千多人。今春在我们恢复阵地、坚持生产的口号下，把这些人都组织起来了，把少数人留在平定、盂县、阳泉等地生产，发动三万多人回村种地。我们的武工队深入阎占区，一面掩护和协助群众耕种，一面对敌进行宣传。寿阳阎家坪群众和武工队，一面生产，一面打仗，九天就打了七次，群众采用白天到山沟分散休息，夜晚分工警戒、生产的办法，胜利的完成了生产任务。三庄、阔子头等九村群众，在我民兵武工队掩护下，二十五天抢种抢耕土地三千余亩。
