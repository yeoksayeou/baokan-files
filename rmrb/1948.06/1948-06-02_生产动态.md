　　Production Dynamics
  　Songjiazhuang, Licheng, Reclaims Land and Stores Surplus Grain
    [Licheng News] Songjiazhuang Village, in the Second District of Licheng, has completed its spring plowing and sowing. On the night of the 21st of last month, a meeting of team leaders and group leaders was held to discuss how to increase production. Everyone agreed that reclaiming slopes would be beneficial. Out of the village's 168 households, 150 participated in land reclamation, with the remainder mostly being elderly, widowed, or without labor. A summary on the 19th showed that the village had reclaimed a total of 458 mu of land, including 101 mu of previously reclaimed and cultivated wasteland by the troops, with the rest being newly reclaimed land.

　　Luoeryu and Other Villages Jointly Build Furrows
    [Xingtai News] This spring, Luoeryu, Zhanggou, and Laocanghui villages in the Seventh District jointly built a furrow, converting 130 mu of dry land into irrigated land. One hundred and four laborers from the three villages, led by Zhang Yuanchun, a peasant who had been emancipated, and district cadres, completed the work in eight or nine days.
　　Chongshuiyu, Xingtai, Repairs Irrigation for Wheat
    [Xingtai News] This year, Chongshuiyu Village in the Tenth District suffered from water shortage, with the spring water not flowing, making it impossible to irrigate over 160 mu of wheat even for the second time. The Production Committee organized the masses to repair the irrigation system. After four days of repairs, using over one hundred laborers, the 160 mu of wheat can now be irrigated. Even if it doesn't rain, the wheat can still be irrigated several times before harvest, and millet can also be planted. (Yuan Zhenkui, et al.)
