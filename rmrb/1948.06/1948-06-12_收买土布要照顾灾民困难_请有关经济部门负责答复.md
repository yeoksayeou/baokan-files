　　Purchasing Homespun Cloth Must Take Into Account the Difficulties of Disaster-Stricken People
  　Please Have Relevant Economic Departments Provide a Responsible Reply
    Comrade Editor:
    The spring famine in Yongnian is very serious. Apart from the government distributing relief grain and funds, the main relief measure is to develop rural side occupations, especially the textile industry. The sales of homespun cloth mainly depended on the large-scale purchases by Taihang and De Tai stores some time ago. Recently, for some unknown reason, the Taihang store suddenly stopped purchasing. According to Liang Yuanchun, director of the Liu Yingji Exchange, "De Tai store made a suggestion to the Trade Bureau in order to complete the task of purchasing homespun cloth, so that Taihang was not allowed to purchase here. However, Taihang bought more, and even some coarser cloth was also purchased. De Tai store is very harsh in its purchases, only wanting the best quality cloth. If there is a single skip in the weave, they don't want it. At the same time, the price they offer is very low. They stipulate that the best quality cloth is 140 yuan per square foot, which includes a storage fee of 1 fen, a handling fee of 6 li, and an remittance fee of 1 fen and 4 li, so the actual price is only 135 yuan per square foot. Based on this price, each bolt of cloth is worth about 11,000 yuan, which can buy 50 jin of millet. After deducting the cost of cotton, which is 25 jin of millet, each bolt of cloth requires 2.5 old jin of cotton. At 2,000 yuan per jin, and with 15 days of labor required for each bolt of cloth, each person needs 1.5 jin of millet per day for food, fuel, salt, and vegetables, leaving only 25 jin of millet, which is just enough to eat and drink. In this way, the poor masses cannot earn a single cent by weaving cloth. If there are no sales and they cannot sell their cloth, they will starve immediately. Therefore, an old poor peasant woman from Zhanghuzhuang in the Fifth District said, "I went to Liu Yingji several times hungry, but I couldn't sell my cloth or exchange it for food. What am I going to do!?"
    In order to provide relief to the masses in Yongnian during the spring famine, I would like to make the following suggestions: First, I hope that the higher-level financial authorities will understand the situation and still allow the Taihang store to purchase cloth in Yongnian. Second, I request that the De Tai store not be too strict in selecting cloth. It would be best to also purchase the slightly inferior second-grade cloth, because most of the poor women's weaving skills are not high. Third, the price of the cloth should be appropriately increased so that the masses can earn a little money in addition to the cost of food and drink. (Yanan)

　　收买土布要照顾灾民困难
  　请有关经济部门负责答复
    编者同志：
    永年春荒很严重，救济办法，除了政府发放救济粮款外，主要的还是发展农村副业，尤其是纺织业。土布的销路，前些时主要是靠太行和德泰商店的大批收买。最近不知啥缘故，太行商店忽然不收买了，据刘营集交易所主任梁元春说：“德泰商店为了完成收买土布的任务，给贸易总局提出意见，才不让太行在这里收买。可是太行买的多，稍粗一些的也收买，德泰商店买的很苛，光要头把好布，有一个跳梭就不要，同时出的价钱又很低，规定头把好布每方尺一百四十元，还包括保存费一分，手续费六厘，上解款一分四厘，实价每方尺仅一百三十五元。根据这个价钱，每匹布约值一万一千元，可籴小米五十斤，除去用棉花本小米二十五斤，每匹布需棉花老秤二斤半，每斤以两千元计，再以每匹布需工十五天，每人每天吃、烧、盐、菜共需小米一斤半，下余的二十五斤小米，刚刚够吃喝的，这样贫苦群众织布根本不能赚一文钱，倘再没有销路，卖不出手，马上就得挨饿。所以五区张虎庄一个贫农老太太说：“饿着肚子赶了几趟刘营集，卖不了布，换不来粮食，咋着办！？”
    为了救济永年群众春荒，提出几点意见：第一、希望由上级财政机关，了解一下情况，仍允许太行商店来永年买布，第二、要求德泰商店，挑布不要太严格，稍次一点的二把布最好也收买，因大部贫农妇女纺织技术不高，第三、布价要适当的提高一些，除了吃喝成本外，能使群众稍赚点钱才好。（亚南）
