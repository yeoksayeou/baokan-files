【Taihang News】After Zhao Yu Village in the Third District of She County summarized production and selected labor heroes and production models, the production enthusiasm of the villagers was high, and both agricultural and sideline production were doing well, overcoming a severe spring famine. After the democratic party rectification last year, most of the village cadres in the village were inactive. During the spring plowing season, the district convened meetings of key cadres from various villages to get everyone thinking and actively lead the masses in production after returning to the village. After returning to the village, the village cadres immediately started planning and carrying out production among the masses, reorganizing mutual aid teams and cooperatives, creating model mutual aid teams, promoting production throughout the village, and at the same time proposing to use 27,000 Jiao banknotes (drawn from the cooperative's public welfare fund and village public property) as bonuses to reward model production teams. This was widely publicized and promoted on the village's public blackboard, in the dining hall, and in various mutual aid groups. As a result, fourteen mutual aid teams were organized, involving 89 households (out of a total of 225 households in the village). On June 8th, a village-wide production summary meeting was held. In terms of agriculture, 536.6 mu of valley land and 145 mu of water caltrop, sorghum, and hemp land were hoed once, and 132 mu of cotton were hoed twice. In terms of sideline occupations, the village earned a total of 5.82 million ocean Jiao banknotes through transportation, etc., equivalent to more than 26,000 jin of millet, which, at half a jin of millet per person per day, could feed the entire village population for two months and ten days. Secondly, women's spinning and weaving, the village organized sixteen spinning and weaving groups, with 139 households participating, with 128 spinning wheels and 29 looms, spinning a total of 875.5 jin of yarn and weaving 609 jin of cloth. At the meeting, heroes and models were selected, and after discussion by each group, a total of five mutual aid teams were selected. For example, the Fu Luyuan team, with six households, six laborers, and three and a half draft animals, had 64 mu of land. Due to good organization and leadership, combined with agricultural and sideline occupations, in addition to completing agricultural production such as sowing and weeding, they engaged in transportation, firewood cutting, etc., with everyone busy, earning a total of 140,000 ocean Jiao banknotes, and were selected as a model mutual aid team. The Zhang Kui spinning and weaving group spun 114.5 jin of yarn and wove 55 zhang of cloth. Guo Shuanghuan, a spinning and weaving hero, wove eight zhang of cloth and achieved self-sufficiency in clothing for the whole family, and was selected as a spinning and weaving hero. After the heroes and models were selected, they were awarded hoes, sickles, and cotton, etc. The whole village now has great enthusiasm for production and is stepping up the completion of weeding, entering the wheat harvest.
