　　Mobilizing Expelled Children to Enroll
  　Taipei United School Teachers Examine Leftist Errors
    [Licheng News] On May 19th, the Second District Taipei United School received the People's Daily's May 18th publication of articles correcting leftist errors in schools and editorials. On the 20th, they convened a meeting of ten teachers from eight administrative villages in the United School. After reading the editorial, criticisms, and suggestions in the newspaper, everyone examined their own thoughts for leftist biases. Teacher Wang from Bei said, "Last autumn, when I heard that some schools were squeezing out the feudal elements, I quickly mobilized the children to beat one and squeeze out two. I organized a poor peasant study group, which managed 27 children. The whole school has 58 students, accounting for slightly less than 50 percent of the population." Teacher Wu from Qiao said, "Last winter, four or five days after school started, I squeezed out and beat three students. The education department and the United School talked to me, and I thought I was following the poor peasant line, serving the poor peasants, and even made those squeezed-out students deliver 20 catties of firewood every day." Last winter, schools such as Yannan established poor peasant study groups and security groups to manage landlord and rich peasant children. Cadres were replaced with children of the emancipated, and the children of landlords and rich peasants were made to deliver letters, carry water, and sweep the floor every day. In total, out of 486 children in the United School, 27 were squeezed out, and 132 were under control, which made the school depressed, teachers were unmotivated, children could not read, and the masses reflected, "That's enough!" After a morning of ideological examination, everyone was determined to go back and mobilize all the expelled students to enroll.
    Another problem was the inappropriate coordination with the village's work, which resulted in children not attending classes regularly, causing parents to say that school was useless and that studying didn't count, making children feel bored and unwilling to enter the school gate. After a day of discussion and examination, everyone was determined to correct these two biases. The work performance of each person will be checked on June 6th. (Fude, Sen Qin)

　　动员被挤儿童入学
  　台北联校教员检查左倾错误
    【黎城消息】二区台北联校，在上月十九号，接到人民日报十八号登载的纠正学校左倾错误及短论等，于二十号即召开全联校八个行政村的十个教员会议，读了报上的短论、批评与建议后，大家从个人思想检查左倾偏向，望北教员说：“去年秋天听到有学校挤封建，我就赶快发动儿童打了一个，挤了两个，组织贫雇学习小组，管起来的二十七个。全学校共学童五十八个，占人数百分之五十弱。”仵桥教员说：“我去年冬开学四五天就挤打了三个，教育科与联校和我谈，我以为走的是贫雇路线，这是为贫雇服务，挤出的还每日叫他们交柴二十斤。”岩南等学校去年冬先后成立贫雇学习组与治安组，来管理地富儿童。将干部撤换成翻身儿童，叫地主富农儿童每天送信、抬水、扫地。总计全联校四百八十六个儿童，挤打出的二十七个，管制的一百三十二个，使学校消沉，教员没劲去干，儿童识不上字，群众反映：“就这吧！”经过一上午的思想检查后，大家决心回去把挤出的学生都动员他们入学。
    另一个是配合村上工作不恰当，儿童上课不经常，引起家长说到学校不顶事，念书不算话，使儿童感到无趣，不进校门。经一天的讨论检查，大家下定决心纠正这两个偏向。到六六节要检查各人工作成绩。（福德、森芹）
