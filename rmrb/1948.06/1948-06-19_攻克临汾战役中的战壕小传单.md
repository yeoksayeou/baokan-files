Xinhua News Agency, Linfen, 17th: The People's Liberation Army on the Linfen front, during their prolonged trench life and combat, created a trench leaflet that is very effective for troop education and mobilization. After the troops entered the trenches, they were scattered throughout the positions and in the bomb shelters within the trenches. The original methods of study and cultural entertainment became inconvenient, and the troops found life monotonous and dull. Some units set up clubs and bulletin boards in the trenches. However, the clubs became too crowded, which didn't meet the requirements for dispersion and concealment. Therefore, the soldiers and the masses launched a variety of small-scale cultural and recreational activities. Among them, "clapper talk" was the most popular, and everyone liked to express all aspects of life, study, and combat experience in this form. At that time, the enemy was using poison gas bombs and throwing white phosphorus bombs against our army. The leadership instructed various units to use this "clapper talk" form to educate soldiers on the methods they came up with to deal with these. The "Zhengzhou" unit took the lead in using this form to conduct education on the three bombs (illumination bombs, white phosphorus bombs, and poison gas bombs). Their method was to mobilize the troops to discuss the properties of the three bombs and our countermeasures, and then summarize them into simple and easy-to-understand leaflets in the form of "clapper talk," which were distributed to various trenches.

After these leaflets were distributed to the troops, they were welcomed by cadres and soldiers alike, helping them quickly dispel their concerns about the three bombs. Soldier Wei Xueguang said, "After reading the leaflet, I know that illumination bombs don't hurt people and can also help identify the terrain, so I'm not afraid at all." The leaflet about illumination bombs read: "Illumination bombs, no big deal, just a tin can on the outside. They don't explode and don't hurt people, they're just for lighting at night. Don't move when they land, take advantage of the light to see the terrain. Once they go out, move forward quickly." The poison gas prevention leaflet put forward various methods of poison gas prevention: "Prepare lime water and soap towels in the position; when you discover the enemy is releasing poison gas, fold the towel six times lengthwise and widthwise; wet it with lime water, soap water is even safer; cover your mouth and nose when it's wet, and the poison gas won't get in. If lime and soap are not convenient, wash the towel with urine and cover your mouth. If there's no time, use wet soil to cover it tightly; wheat seedlings and green grass can also be used, twist them and block your mouth and nose. If possible, run to higher ground, it's safer on higher ground. If there's time, you can use bombs and explosives to break it up; wet soil can also bury it, splashing water can also drown it, cover your mouth with broken shoes and rotten socks, the methods are simple and convenient. We have plenty of methods, the enemy's poison gas is useless." After seeing the poison gas prevention leaflet, soldier Li Shihua said, "The enemy launching poison gas bombs is bullshit, we have plenty of ways to deal with it." After the three-bomb education, the leadership found that trench leaflets were one of the most effective ways to conduct political work in the trenches. Therefore, based on the current central work of the troops and the various combat methods devised by the soldiers, they consciously and systematically produced and distributed the leaflets. For a time, trench leaflets became popular in various units.

When the troops were about to use tunnel blasting to destroy the enemy's bunkers, two types of trench leaflets were produced. One read: "We have airplanes, just for the enemy to sit on, not flying in the sky, but drilling underground. Infantry like runways, engineers drive the machines, when the enemy sits on, they're all thrilled to death." The other read: "The enemy is afraid of our airplanes, always trying to escape without sitting on them, drilling underground to listen with jars, and sending infantry out to fight. We have a group here, experts in making airplanes, sweating and not afraid of hardship, devising methods according to the situation, calculating accurately without deviation, carefully and boldly digging in, making airplanes for him, the enemy has no choice but to sit on them."

Based on the characteristics of the siege battle and the experience of attacking outer strongholds, it was necessary to strengthen small-group actions, so the commander's leadership was a very important issue. Therefore, the leadership summoned several squad leaders who had commanded well in the past and made great contributions to discuss the issue of squad leader command. Then, based on the results of the discussion, they wrote a leaflet and took it to the company to solicit the opinions of some squad leaders and soldiers. After modification, it was printed into leaflets. After being distributed, the squad leader comrades cherished it as if they had found a treasure, and the platoon leaders also scrambled to read it. A deputy platoon leader, Zhu Qingyun, said: "This solves my command position problem and helps me a lot. I hope more will be printed in the future." After receiving it, neighboring units immediately reprinted and distributed it.

Before the general attack on the east gate of Linfen, in order to improve the tactical movements of the assault team and the depth combat troops, two leaflets, "Steel Nails and Steel Cones" and "How to Fight in Depth," were written. The former wrote: "The assault team is like a steel nail, nailed to the breakthrough, more stable than Mount Tai; the assault team is like a steel cone, inserted into the enemy's heart, drilling all the way in. Advance a step, nail a nail, no retreat, only advance. Stick in a cone, smell the blood, and have a good meal of meat." The first two sections of "How to Fight in Depth" are: "(1) In-depth combat requires boldness, attacking fiercely and rushing in, quickly confusing the enemy, not letting the bastards catch their breath. When enemy and us are mixed together, commanding requires more method. Be careful, be bold, use more tricks to bluff him. Also, don't fight a silent battle, shouting can be better than a machine gun. The enemy is dizzy and turned around, and even if there are many people, we can take them as prisoners. (2) When fighting in depth, disperse, don't crowd together. If you encounter few enemies, simply eat them. If you encounter many enemies, head-on collision is useless, flank and encircle them, attack with frontal firepower, pinch them with pliers, see what kind they have, if they want to run, they can't, we can do whatever we want with them." Hou Jin, the battalion instructor of a certain unit, said, "After reading the leaflet 'How to Fight in Depth,' I solved a head-on collision problem in the depth development."

As soon as the leaflets were distributed to the troops, everyone scrambled to read them. Those who could not read asked others to read them to them. They would rather rest less to read the leaflets. Many people read them while holding their rice bowls, and some did not sleep in the morning just to read them. Zhang Congshan, a soldier in the machine gun company of a certain unit, often went to the company headquarters to ask for leaflets to read. Zhou Sanhu put the leaflets in his pocket after reading them, saying, "It will be useful when the time comes." Soldier Yang Gouwa said: "The leaflets are easy to say, easy to understand, easy to remember, and also useful, they can really solve problems."

In the battle to capture the east gate of Linfen, Li Hongyin, a new soldier in the 206th unit, was hit by the enemy's white phosphorus bomb during the charge. He rolled several times, and there was still some that had not been extinguished. He quickly took off his clothes and threw them away, and as a result, he was not injured. After the battle, he came back and said, "The method said on the leaflet is effective. I was hit by a white phosphorus bomb, did what the leaflet said, and was not injured at all." Several soldiers in the second company, when breaking into the deep trenches, kept reciting "We are steel nails."

The reason why the soldiers like and cherish these trench leaflets is that these leaflets introduce their own experiences, tell them methods, and closely combine them with battlefield training and ideological mobilization, helping them improve their tactics and techniques. In terms of form, the leaflets all adopt the form of clapper talk. The sentences are written in simple and easy-to-understand language, the characters are printed large and clearly, and there are no simplified characters, and some are even accompanied by cartoons. Therefore, it is warmly welcomed by the majority of soldiers and has become one of the most effective methods and tools for trench political work.

　　攻克临汾战役中的战壕小传单
    临汾前线的人民解放军，在长期的战壕生活和战斗中，创造了一种对部队教育鼓动作用很大的战壕小传单。部队进入战壕后，由于成天都分散在阵地上和战壕中的避弹坑内，原来的各种学习、文化娱乐方式都不便进行，部队觉得生活单调枯燥，有些部队就在战壕里布置了俱乐部，出了门板报。但这样一来，俱乐部便太拥挤了，不合乎分散隐蔽的要求。于是士兵群众展开了许多小型的文化娱乐活动。其中以“快板”流行最广，大家都喜欢把一切的生活、学习和战斗经验用这种形式表达出来。这时正当敌人对我军施放毒气弹和投掷黄磷弹等，领导机关在发动部队研究对付的方法时，就指示各部把想出来的办法利用这种“快板”的形式教育战士。“郑州”部首先利用这种形式，进行了三弹（照明弹、黄磷弹、毒气弹）教育。他们的办法是发动部队讨论三弹的性能，和我们对付的办法，然后综合起来，用“快板”的形式，把它写成简单通俗的小传单，分发到各个战壕中去。
    这种传单发到部队后，干部战士都很欢迎，帮助他们迅速解除了对三弹的顾虑。战士卫学广说：“看了传单后知道照明弹不伤人，还可辨明地形，我一点也不害怕了。”关于照明弹的传单是：“照明弹，没啥用，外面是个洋铁桶。不爆炸，不伤人，专为夜间来照明。没落地，不要动，趁着明亮看地形。等它熄灭了，赶快就前进。”防毒传单提出了关于防毒的各种办法：“阵地准备石灰水、肥皂手巾带身边；发现敌人放毒气，手巾纵横叠六遍；上面湿上石灰水，肥皂水用来更保险；湿好蒙住口和鼻，毒气不能往里钻。石灰肥皂不方便，手巾洗尿蒙口边，要是一时来不及，就用湿土来蒙严；麦苗绿草都能用，扭扭堵在口鼻间。要是可能往高地跑，跑上高地也保险。要是时间来得及，可用炸弹炸药来打散；湿土也能埋住它，泼水也能把它淹，破鞋烂袜蒙住嘴，办法简单又方便。咱们有的是办法，敌人放毒也枉然。”战士李士华看见防毒传单后说：“敌人放毒气弹也扯球蛋，咱们有的是对付办法。”经过三弹教育后，领导上发现战壕传单是在战壕中进行政治工作的最有效方式之一，便根据部队当前的中心工作和战士们想出的各种作战办法，有意识的有计划的制发，一时战壕传单就在各个部队里流行起来了。
    当部队要采取坑道爆破去摧毁敌人的堡垒时，制发了两种战壕传单。一种写道：“咱们有飞机，光叫敌人坐，不在天上飞，钻在地底下。步兵象跑道，工兵把机驾，敌人一坐上，全都美死啦。”另一种写道：“敌人害怕咱飞机，总想逃避不坐它，钻在地下用缸听，又用步兵出来打。咱们这里一伙子，装造飞机老行家，汗流湿土不怕苦，根据情况想办法，精确计算没偏差，细心大胆往里挖，飞机给他装制好，敌人不坐不由他。”
    根据攻坚战斗的特点和攻打外围据点的经验，须要加强小群动作，因此班长的指挥是一个非常重要的问题。于是领导上便召集过去指挥好，战功大的几个班长座谈班长的指挥问题，然后根据讨论的结果写成传单，又拿到连队里征求一些班长和战士的意见，经修改后，再把它印成传单。发下去后，班长同志如获至宝，排长也争着要看。一个副排长朱清云说：“这解决了我的指挥位置问题对我帮助很大，希望以后多印一些。”友邻部队接到后，也马上翻印散发。
    总攻临汾东关前，为了改善突击队和纵深战斗部队的战术动作，便又写了“钢钉和钢锥”，“怎样打纵深”两种传单。前一种写道：“突击队，象钢钉，钉在突破口，赛过泰山稳；突击队，象锥尖，插进敌心脏，一直往里钻。进一步，钉个钉，没有后退只前进。扎一锥，闻着腥，见肉美美吃一顿。”“怎样打纵深”这张传单的头两节是：“（一）纵深战斗要大胆，猛打猛冲往里钻，快把敌人打混乱，不让龟孙把气喘。敌我混成一圪塔，指挥更要有办法。心要细，胆要大，多用计谋诈唬他。还要不打哑吧仗，喊话能顶机关枪。敌人昏头转了向，人多也得把俘虏当。（二）打纵深，要疏散，不要挤成一圪塔。碰上敌人少，干脆吃掉他。碰上敌人多，顶牛不中用，侧翼去迂回，正面火力攻，钳子一圪挟，看他有啥种，想跑跑不了，任凭我摆弄。”某部营教导员侯进说：“看了‘怎样打纵深’这张传单，解决了我在纵深发展中一个顶牛问题”。
    传单一发到部队，大家抢着看，不识字的要求别人给他念，宁愿少休息一会，也要看传单，许多人端着饭碗看，有的上午不睡觉，还要去看。某部机枪连战士张从善常到连部去要传单看。周三虎把传单看罢后，就装进了口袋里，说：“到时候好用它”。战士杨狗娃说：“小传单又顺嘴，又好懂，容易记，还能用，真能解决问题。”
    在攻占临汾东关的战斗中，二○六部队新战士李红银，在冲锋时，中了敌人的黄磷弹，他就连打了几个滚，还有一点没有熄，他就急忙把衣服脱下扔了，结果没有受伤，战斗结束后，他一回来就说：“传单上说的办法就是灵。我中了黄磷弹，照着传单上的办法做了，一点也没有受伤。”二连几个战士在突进纵深壕里，还在不断地念着“我们是钢钉”。
    战士们之所以喜欢和爱护这种战壕传单，是因为这种传单介绍了他们自己的经验，又告诉了他们办法，与战场练兵，思想发动密切结合，帮助他们提高战术和技术。在形式上，传单全是采用快板形式，句子写得简单通俗，字印的又大又显，并且没有简笔字，有的更配有漫画。因此它就受到广大战士热烈的欢迎，成了战壕政治工作最有效的一种方式和工具。
