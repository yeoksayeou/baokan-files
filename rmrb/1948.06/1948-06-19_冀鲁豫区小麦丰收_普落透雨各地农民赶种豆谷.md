[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region News] This year's wheat harvest in our region is abundant. In the area south of the Yellow River, during the frequent seesaw battles last autumn, our local Party, government, military cadres, and the masses, under their leadership, seized every opportunity to rush to cultivate and sow. Since the beginning of spring, due to favorable weather conditions, the wheat seedlings have flourished, resembling a vast expanse of green sea. In the fertile wheat-producing area of Dongping Lake, the wheat is waist-high, with ears as long as rice grains. In the southern counties of Yuncheng, Yunjü, and Linze, the scene is filled with the joy of a bountiful harvest. Currently, under the protection of our large army and local armed forces, farmers are excitedly and diligently rushing to harvest the new wheat and bring it to the threshing grounds. Around Dongping Lake, each mu (approximately 1/6 of an acre) yields around 200 jin (approximately 220 pounds) of wheat, with some yielding up to 300 jin. In Yuncheng and other areas south of the river, each mu yields around 100 jin of wheat. In the sandy areas of Linze and Yunjü, the average yield is 70 to 80 jin per mu. In areas near Heze, Yunjü, and Linze, the masses reflected, "Those lousy bandits (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek troops) are constantly coming to loot. If we don't harvest today's wheat, it will be snatched away; fortunately, our great army crossed the river, and we are peacefully harvesting and taking it home." On June 7th, various counties in Henan also received rain of three to four finger depths, and now the masses are rushing to plant crops while threshing and storing wheat. In the area north of the Yellow River, due to the arduous war support tasks last autumn, the leadership and the masses made a hundredfold effort to overcome the various difficulties caused by excessive rain, ensuring that the wheat planting area remained balanced with previous years, and this year's wheat harvest averages around 100 jin per mu.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region News] On June 6th and 7th, "wetting rain" fell universally in Hebei and Henan in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. In some areas of Yanggu and Hua County, soaking rain fell. The masses everywhere said: With this rain, in addition to corn and sweet potatoes, beans, millet, sorghum, etc. can all be sown. Now the masses everywhere are rushing to plant. The Eighth Administrative Office, in order to solve the problem of bean seed shortages for the masses, is exchanging beans for wheat with the masses, one jin for one jin (the market price of mung beans is 30,000 yuan per dou, and wheat is 7,000 yuan). The Fourth Military Sub-district Headquarters is also exchanging all the mung beans of the organs with the wheat of the villagers (also one jin for one jin), and is drawing livestock to help villagers without labor and livestock to haul manure and cultivate the land.

　　冀鲁豫区小麦丰收
  　普落透雨各地农民赶种豆谷
    【冀鲁豫讯】今年本区小麦丰收。黄河南岸地区，在去秋的频繁的拉锯战中，我当地党政军民干部，领导群众抓紧空隙进行抢耕抢种，入春以来，因风调雨顺，麦苗勃发，如一片碧绿大海。丰饶的东平湖产麦区，麦高腰际，穗长若谷。南岸郓城、郓巨、临泽等县，均充满丰收景象。目前在我大军和地方武装保卫下，农民们已兴奋紧张的抢收新麦入场。东平湖一带，每亩收麦二百斤左右，有的收至三百斤。南岸郓城等于地，每亩收麦百斤左右。临泽、郓巨等沙地，一般的每亩收麦七、八十斤。荷泽附近、郓巨、临泽等地，群众反映说：“那些孬种（指蒋匪军）不断的来抢，今天的麦子打不下来就会被抢去；幸亏咱的大军一过河，咱平平和和的收回家里啦”。六月七日河南各县又落了三、四指深的雨，现在群众正一面抢种，一面打藏麦粮。黄河以北地区，则是在去年秋季繁重的战勤任务中，由于领导与群众百倍努力，克服了因天雨过多所造成的种种困难，保证种麦面积与往年保持平衡，今年麦收平均每亩在百斤左右。
    【冀鲁豫讯】六月六、七两日，冀鲁豫区河北、河南各地普遍下了“接湿雨”，阳谷及滑县部分地区，则下了透雨。各地群众都说：有这场雨，除棒子红薯外，豆子、谷子、黍子等都能耩上。现各地群众正赶紧抢种中。八专署为给群众解决豆种困难，特用豆子向群众换麦，一斤换一斤（市价绿豆一斗三万元，麦子七千元）。四分区指挥部也将机关所有的绿豆与驻村群众交换麦子（也是一斤换一斤），并抽出牲口帮助驻村无劳力和无牲口户拉粪耩地。
