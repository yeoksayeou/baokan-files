Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The American reactionaries are actively assisting Japan in developing foreign trade in order to accelerate the revival of Japanese aggression forces. The Chiang government, which believes that "there is no need to oppose the U.S. support for Japan" (Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department), has been acting as an accomplice in the U.S. policy of supporting Japan. After exporting a large amount of raw materials such as iron sand, salt, and soybeans to Japan, the Chiang government shipped another 1,850 tons of salt to Japan at the beginning of this month. The so-called "private trade delegation" dispatched by the Chiang government has been arriving in China one after another since January this year, and as of the beginning of this month. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th, more than ten trade contracts have been signed with Japanese businessmen, the first of which stipulates the exchange of 110,000 pounds of ramie for Japanese artificial ramie. According to various reports, the Japanese trade delegation, which arrived in India on the 5th of last month under the encouragement and support of MacArthur's headquarters, signed a trade agreement with India on the 9th with a total value of several million pounds, stipulating the exchange of Indian pig iron and jute for Japanese machinery and factory equipment. The delegation also reached an agreement with Pakistan, under which Pakistan will supply Japan with two large packages of cotton in exchange for Japanese cloth. Japanese businessmen and the Singapore authorities also concluded an agreement at the end of last month to open private trade: both parties agreed that, in addition to rubber, emulsion, potato flour, and flour from Malaya and aquatic products from Japan, other goods could be freely traded by private merchants. According to the Japanese Economic Security Headquarters on the 3rd, 27,000 tons of pig iron are scheduled to be shipped to Japan from India and Malaya in the near future. According to a contract signed by MacArthur's headquarters and the French mission in Japan, Japan can obtain 25,000 tons of anthracite from French Vietnam within the year. The United States will also ship 32,000 tons of anthracite to Japan to restore the production of Japanese fertilizer factories. On the 17th of last month, a spokesperson for the Japan Wool Textile Company announced that Japan and Australia had concluded a trade agreement, under which Australian merchants would exchange 50,000 bales of wool for 3 million pounds of Japanese cloth. It is reported that the wool supplied by Australia is sufficient for 49 Japanese wool machines and 560 weaving machines for half a year. To promote and expand trade relations between Japan and the countries of the Sterling bloc, MacArthur announced a new comprehensive currency measure on the 1st. The new measure stipulates that trade between Japan and the countries of the Sterling bloc can be paid in pounds, except for transactions involving cotton fabrics purchased from the United States. The countries participating in the agreement on this comprehensive currency measure include England, Australia, Burma, Ireland, Iceland, Iraq, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, the Faroe Islands, South Africa, and various Islamic countries such as Persia. A senior official within MacArthur's headquarters revealed that the purpose of this new measure is to "strive to establish normal pre-war Japanese trade relations."
