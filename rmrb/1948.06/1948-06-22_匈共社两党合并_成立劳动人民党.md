　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS, Budapest: The founding congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, formed by the merger of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, solemnly opened in the Hungarian capital on June 12th. In addition to the party representatives, representatives from the Smallholders Party, the National Peasant Party, the Trade Union Federation, the Democratic Women's League, other democratic parties, and foreign guests attended the congress. Hungarian President Tildy and Prime Minister Nyis also attended and offered their congratulations. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent a congratulatory telegram to the congress stating: "Thanks to the cooperation and unity of the workers' parties, the Hungarian people have achieved significant successes in the struggle for Hungarian independence and for the democratic reconstruction of the country's political and economic life. The merger of the two workers' parties is a historic event in the Hungarian working-class movement and a guarantee of new victories for the Hungarian working people."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS, Budapest: At the first congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, formed by the merger of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Rákosi, delivered a political report on the 13th. Rákosi first summarized the achievements of Hungary's economic construction, stating: "Hungary's industrial and agricultural production will reach pre-war levels this year. Industrial production has already exceeded the level of the best pre-war year (i.e., 1938). Labor productivity is increasing, labor discipline is improving, and labor competitions among workers and peasants are now expanding. All of this establishes confidence that the Three-Year Plan will be completed in two and a half years (according to the Three-Year Plan, which began on August 1st last year, will be completed in January 1950 if it is completed in two and a half years). Due to the economic rise, the living standards of industrial workers reached pre-war levels in May of this year, and in heavy industry, coal mining, and the textile industry, it has already exceeded this level. In three and a half years, the Hungarian democratic system, led by the Communist Party, has brought about fundamental changes in the country's economic system. The majority of industry, the entire coal mining industry, and railways have been transferred to the state through nationalization. Today, 86 percent of all workers in the country work in government-managed industries and railways." Rákosi then pointed out the current political situation in Hungary, stating: "In Hungary, workers and peasants are already in power. In the past three and a half years, the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has demonstrated its ability to govern the country and has become the leading and decisive force, which has been recognized by the vast majority of the people. The prestige of the Communist Party among the people has increased unprecedentedly. In the first four months of this year, 200,000 new members joined the party. The correct policy of the Communist Party has isolated the right wing of the Social Democratic Party, creating a sound prerequisite for the merger of the two working-class parties. Another important prerequisite for unity is that the Social Democrats recognize Marxism-Leninism as their ideological program. The joint program declaration submitted to the congress for deliberation was drafted in the spirit of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." In discussing the theses and the tasks in the future, Rákosi pointed out: "One of the major tasks facing the Hungarian Working People's Party is to establish a unified, mass national independence front to replace the current national independence front, which is merely cooperation at the upper levels of the parties. In the new front, it is necessary to ensure that trade unions, women, youth, and other mass organizations and various political parties occupy their due positions." Rákosi also pointed out: "Friendship with the Soviet Union and close cooperation with various people's democratic countries are the cornerstones of our party's policy."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. TASS, Budapest: The first founding congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, which opened on the 12th with the merger of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, closed on the 14th after adopting the draft program of the party and electing the leading body. The congress decided to guide the party's program, masses, organizational structure, and entire activities with the principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The congress elected a leading body composed of 66 full members and 12 alternate members, including Rákosi (formerly the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party) and Szakasits (formerly the General Secretary of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party). The congress decided to use *Szabad Nép* (formerly the Hungarian Communist Party's newspaper) as the central organ of the Working People, and *Népszava* (formerly the Hungarian Social Democratic Party's newspaper) as the central organ of the Hungarian Trade Union. The congress also sent a letter to Stalin, expressing deep gratitude to the Soviet people for helping the Hungarian people to break free from the shackles of enslavement and embark on the road of progress. The report declared that the Hungarian people will strive to pursue a policy of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet people and will resolutely fight to maintain peace and oppose all attempts by imperialism to undermine peace.

    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：于十二日开幕的匈牙利共产党和社会民主党合并的劳动人民党第一届成立大会，在适过该党纲领草案和选出领导班子后，已于十四日闭幕。大会决定以马恩列斯的原则来指导该党的纲领。群众、组织机构以及整个活动。大会选举了由六十六名正式委员和十二名候补委员组成的领导机关，其中包括拉科西（原为匈共总书记），斯查卡西兹（原为匈社会民主党总书记）等人。大会决定以宛巴德。涅普（原为匈共机关报）为劳动人民的中央机关报，以罗普斯查瓦（原为匈社会民主党机关报）为匈职工会中央机关报。大会并致函斯大林，对苏联人民援助匈牙利人民摆脱奴役的羁绊并走上进步的大道，深表谢意。该报宣称：匈国人民将努力奉行与苏联人民友好和合作的政策，并为维持和平、反对帝国主义破坏和平的一切企图而坚决奋斗。
