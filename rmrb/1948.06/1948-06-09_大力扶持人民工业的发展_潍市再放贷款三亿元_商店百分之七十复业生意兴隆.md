Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th: The Weifang Municipal Government has recently decided to launch an industrial loan program. The amount is 300 million North Sea currency (calculated at 1 North Sea currency yuan equaling 100 Kuomintang currency yuan). Combined with the 100 million yuan small loan issued a week or so ago, the two items total 400 million North Sea currency yuan, equivalent to 40 billion Kuomintang currency yuan. All machine industries and larger-scale handicraft workshops engaged in production for the needs of the broad masses of the people and the revolutionary war, and facing difficulties in capital turnover, will be eligible for loans. Among the recipients of the previous small loans, more than 60% were rickshaw pullers, who have begun using the loans to convert their rickshaws into transport vehicles (each capable of carrying 400-500 catties), which will play a huge role in developing the transportation industry in Weifang and the vast countryside. The remaining recipients of loans, including blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, and some small vendors, have also quickly started production. According to statistics from the Weifang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce: from May 3rd to 17th, in just half a month, the turnover of major commodities such as cotton textiles, dyes, and daily necessities in the city, registered by the bureau, reached 2,844,847,000 North Sea currency yuan. Merchants from as far as Shidao, Shahe, and Yexian in Jiaodong, Zhoucun and Zhangdian on the western route, as well as merchants from coastal areas of central, southern Shandong, are traveling to the city to purchase goods. Although Zhongshan Avenue, the most prosperous area in the city, was looted and bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, 90 shops reopened within a few days of the city's liberation, accounting for 70% of the total number of shops on the street. The remaining 36 are also repairing their facades and reorganizing their interiors, preparing to reopen. Of the 262 businesses on Dongguan Avenue, 191 have reopened, accounting for 74% of the total, and another 41 are planning to reopen. During the Kuomintang rule, the daily turnover of the Yadong Pharmacy was about 4-5 million Kuomintang currency yuan. After the liberation of Weifang, its highest daily revenue was more than 300,000 North Sea currency yuan, and the lowest was 200,000 yuan. The latter, when converted to Kuomintang currency, is equivalent to 20 million yuan, which is four to five times that during the Kuomintang rule.
