Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army strictly implemented urban policies and battlefield discipline during its operation in the Jingwei River basin in late April, achieving remarkable results. This experience proves that the troops have greatly improved in combat effectiveness and political awareness after the Three Check-Ups and Military Rectification.

During the two battles to liberate Yijun and Cheng County, all commanders and fighters of the 5th Detachment of a certain unit did not enter any civilian houses or shops, except for searching for remnants of the enemy. After the battle, except for the guard troops, the rest quickly assembled and rested, without wandering around the city. Before the city's shops opened for business, the detachment headquarters ordered that no one was allowed to buy anything to avoid unsettling the merchants and residents. The 5th Company of the detachment enforced discipline best. They entered Cheng County on April 19th and immediately sent people to guard the telecommunications and post office and other institutions after occupying them, without touching anything in the rooms. Wang Chengming of the 6th Squad (liberated from the Yichuan Campaign in March) did not have a bowl to eat from and wanted to take one, but squad leader Liu Fugui immediately told him, "Take as many guns as you can, but you are not allowed to touch anything else." Wang Xiangzhu of the 3rd Squad had torn pants, and there were plenty of pants in the puppet county government, but he never took any. He said, "I can't ruin the discipline of the entire unit because of one person." For this reason, the unit's leaders specially issued an order on May 17th to commend all the commanders and fighters of the detachment, and issued each commander and fighter of the 5th Company with towels, soap, and daily necessities as a reward.

On the night of April 22nd, when a unit of our army was camping in Donghe Village, Fufeng County, it rained heavily. The soldiers stood on the muddy streets and sent people to ask the people to open the door, but it took a long time to get them to open it. The rain soaked the soldiers' clothes, but the soldiers did not knock on the people's doors. A local villager who was leading the way was also angry because he couldn't get the door open. He cursed and shouted, "If it were Chiang Kai-shek's army, they would have torn down your door long ago." The soldiers immediately explained to him, "It's okay, if you talk to the villagers properly, they will open the door." But the door was not opened that night. The next day, the villagers opened the door and saw that it was the People's Liberation Army. They were both moved and apologetic, and they said to the soldiers, "Please don't take it to heart. Last night, we couldn't tell what kind of troops you were, so we didn't dare to open the door. If we had known it was you, wouldn't we have opened it? We have been looking forward to you until our eyes are blind." On the same day, a certain unit stayed in the home of a wealthy man named Liu. The homeowner had fled, but our army did not touch anything of his when they left, and the borrowed furniture was placed in its original place. After the liberation of Fufeng, no one entered the city's civilian houses, shops, schools, and orphanages without permission. When Changning Town, Yongshou, was liberated, as soon as the battle ended, a work team from a certain unit entered the town with the main attack troops to clean up enemy materials. All items that originally belonged to various shops or schools were returned to them.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: When the Northwest People's Liberation Army advanced into the heartland of Hu Zongnan in the Jingwei River basin, many places saw moving scenes of the masses warmly welcoming our army. When our army arrived at Guozhen Station east of Baoji, the platform was crowded with people vying to see our army. On the railway, some teachers, students, and staff walked back and forth, frequently nodding and greeting our army. The soldiers excitedly shouted slogans such as "We protect the people," "Protect teachers and students," and "Protect industry and commerce." A teacher excitedly waved his hat and shouted, "I can see the light of day! I wish the armed comrades victory, and the People's Liberation Army longevity, longevity!" A day or two before this, the people of Guozhen were already discussing the People's Liberation Army. A vendor from the liberated Fengxiang arrived in Guozhen and told people, "The People's Liberation Army entered Fengxiang without disturbing even the chickens and dogs, and they didn't enter the people's doors. The day after entering the city, the city's people were wandering around the streets, as lively as a fair." This vendor was invited to wine and dine by more than a dozen shops and wealthy people in Guozhen, in order to inquire about the situation when the People's Liberation Army arrived.

After our army arrived at Caijiapo Station (east of Guozhen), workers or students would surround our army's cadres or soldiers as soon as they encountered them, asking them to speak. More than 30 workers spontaneously organized a picket team and a reception group to welcome our army by the railway. Many people and People's Liberation Army soldiers shouted slogans in unison: "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the people!" "China belongs to the people, not Chiang Kai-shek!" The roadside was filled with tea, and many vendors even insisted on stuffing cigarettes and food into the soldiers' pockets, but they were politely declined.

When the masses in a certain area of the western section of the Longhai Railway discovered that there were two wounded soldiers of our army in the wheat fields when our army completed its blocking task and withdrew from the area, they immediately sought medical treatment. After they recovered, they sent dry food and changed them into plain clothes, allowing the two wounded soldiers to escape danger and return to the team. Another wounded soldier, Liang Ronggui, was injured in the buttocks and was taken home by an old man to recuperate. Soon after, the Chiang Kai-shek army arrived and found blood all over the bed sheets, and immediately identified them as People's Liberation Army soldiers, but the old man insisted that they were his own son, "who was injured when he went out." Other people also testified for him, and he was finally deceived.

　　西北我军纪律严明
  　泾渭人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社西北二十七日电】西北人民解放军四月底在进军泾渭流域作战中严格执行城市政策与战场纪律，获得显著成绩。这个经验，证明部队经过三查整军，在争斗力和政治觉悟上都有了极大的提高。
    在解放宜君和＠县的两次战斗中，某部五支队全体指战员，除了搜索残敌外，没有一个进入民房商店的。战斗结束后，除警戒部队外，其余都迅速集结休息，不在城内东走西游。在城市商店未开门营业之前，支队部下令禁止任何人购买东西，以免影响商民不安。该支队五连执行纪律最好，他们在四月十九日进入＠县，占领电信邮局等机关后，立即派人看守，对房里东西丝毫未动。六班的汪成明（三月宜川战役解放过来的）没有碗吃饭，想拿一个用，班长刘福贵马上对他说：“尽量拿枪，其他东西一点不准动。”三班王祥柱裤子破烂，伪县府里有的是裤子，但他始终没有拿，他说：“不能因为我一个人破坏了整个部队的纪律。”为此，该部首长特于五月十七日传令嘉奖该支队全体指战员，并给五连每个指战员发毛巾肥皂日用品，以示奖励。
    四月廿二日夜，我军一部到扶风县东河村宿营时适逢大雨，战士们站在泥泞的街道上，派人叫老百姓开门，很久没有叫开，大雨湿透了战士们的衣服，但战士们没有去敲老百姓的门。一个带路的本地老百姓因喊门喊不开也生气了，他连骂带喊地说：“要是遇到蒋介石的军队，早把你这门拆毁啦。”战士们立即向他解释：“没关系，好好和老乡们讲他们就会开门的。”但是这一夜竟没有叫开门。第二天，老乡们开了门一看，见是解放军，又感动又抱歉，纷纷向战士们说：“请莫记在心里，昨夜我们闹不清是什么队伍，所以没敢开门。早知是你们，我们会不开吗？盼你们眼都要盼瞎啦。”某部当天晚上住在一个姓刘的老财家里，房主人已逃跑了，我军走时，对他的东西丝毫未动，借用的家具都放在原来的地方。解放扶风后，该城的民房、商店、学校和育幼院等均没有一人擅自进入。解放永寿常宁镇时，战斗刚一结束，某部工作队即随主攻部队进入该镇，清理敌人物资，其中原属于各商店或学校者，均一律发还他们。
    【新华社西北二十七日电】西北人民解放军向泾渭流域胡宗南腹心地区进军时，许多地方出现了群众热烈欢迎我军的动人场面。我军到达宝鸡以东的虢镇车站时，月台上已挤满了人，争看我军。在铁路上有些教员学生和职员络绎不断走来走去，频频向我军点头招呼，战士们兴奋的高喊“我们保护老百姓”，“保护教员学生”，“保护工商业”等口号。一位教员兴奋的挥着礼帽边走边喊：“我得见天日了！祝武装同志们胜利，解放军天长地久，天长地久呀！”在此前一两天，虢镇人民就在议论着解放军了。有一个小贩从解放了的凤翔到了虢镇，向人们宣传着：“解放军进了凤翔鸡狗都不惊，也不进老百姓的门，进城第二天城里老百姓就满街游逛，象赶会一样热闹。”这个小贩，在虢镇被十几家商店和有钱人请去吃酒吃饭，为的是向他打听解放军来了的情形。
    我军到达蔡家坡车站（虢镇东）后，工人或学生们一遇到我军干部或战士，就包围起来要求给他们讲话。三十多个工人自动组织起纠察队和招待组在铁路旁欢迎我军，许多群众和解放军战士一呼一应地喊着口号：“解放军万岁！”“老百姓万岁！”“中国是老百姓的，不是蒋介石的！”路旁摆满了茶水，许多商贩还硬将纸烟食品往战士口袋里塞，但均被婉言谢绝。
    陇海西段某地群众，在我军完成阻击任务撤离该地时，发现麦地有我军两个伤员，立即延医治疗，伤好后送了干粮换上便衣，使两个伤员脱险归队。另一伤员梁荣贵臀部受伤，被一位老乡接回家去休养。不久蒋军到来发现血满床褥，即都为解放军战士，但老汉坚称是他自己的儿子，“因出门被打伤了的”，其他老百姓也替他作证明，终被瞒过。
