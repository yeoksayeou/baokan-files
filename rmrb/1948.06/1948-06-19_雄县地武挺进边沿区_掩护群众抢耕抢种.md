　　Xiong County Local Armed Forces Advance into Border Areas
　　Protecting the Masses in Seizing the Time for Plowing and Planting
　　[Jizhong, 18th] Since May, the Xiong County Local Armed Forces have actively advanced into the border areas, carrying out political offensives and protecting the masses in seizing the time for plowing and planting. Under the active operations of our armed forces, the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops were forced to shrink to the vicinity of Baigou and Sizhuang. Our district work teams and militia, in coordination with local cadres, vigorously restored and developed the areas. The puppet Baojia headquarters in certain districts were destroyed by us. Our organizations have been established and restored in certain districts, and militias have been established in some villages. Our local armed forces and militia have continuously launched political offensives, conducting broadcasts from high houses, conducting individual visits, and holding various meetings to widely publicize the news of our army's victory and expose the enemy's deceptive propaganda, and educate bad elements. Since May, in certain districts alone, more than sixty puppet soldiers and puppet organization personnel, and forty-four households of fleeing landlords have been won over to return home. Our local armed forces, work teams, and militia actively protect the masses in seizing the time for plowing and planting, mobilizing men, women, old and young to go to the fields for production. The masses in some villages have organized all the manpower and animal power in the village, and promoted mutual aid and shock plowing. Under the protection of our local armed forces and the active shock work of the masses, certain districts have completed more than 5,000 mu of land for plowing and planting, and certain districts have completed more than 4,000 mu. The local people happily said: "The enemy grabs manpower and levies grain, only destroying production. Our Eighth Route Army is really telling the people to produce! You take care of us so thoughtfully!"
　　[Jizhong, 18th] The local armed forces of Jinwu and Xiong County actively fought. On May 5, they annihilated more than 40 puppet bandits from Anci who disturbed Jing'ertou, Sipu and other villages. On the 6th, they captured three enemies in Madaokou Village. On the 7th, the unit ambushed puppet Da Township personnel who came out of Xinzhang at Cexing (18 li east of Shengfang), annihilating six puppets. On the 9th, they ambushed more than 100 Shengfang bandit troops at Shangjiabao (6 li north of Shengfang), killing and wounding nine enemies. On the 23rd, the county's local armed forces ambushed the enemy invading from Shengfang at Fanlijucun, killing and wounding 32 enemy soldiers including a company commander. On the 31st, the county's local armed forces cooperated with a certain unit to liberate Shengfang. On June 3, they also cooperated with a certain unit to once captured Yangfenggang, 40 li west of Jinxi, annihilating more than 140 enemies. In the above battles, a total of more than 230 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, and two machine guns, 31 rifles, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 10 million yuan in puppet currency, and some other items were seized.
