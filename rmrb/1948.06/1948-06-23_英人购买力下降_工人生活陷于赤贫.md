Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. TASS, London: The Daily Worker recently reported that the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians recently held its annual meeting in London and passed a resolution requiring the British Trades Union Congress to formulate its own price policy and an overall economic plan for Britain. Delegates vehemently criticized the TUC's tactics regarding the government's wage freeze policy, deeming them slow and clumsy. Chairman William declared: If unequal sacrifices continue, workers will not make greater production efforts. Birmingham delegate Hook said that steelworkers' wages are shockingly low. He said that thousands of workers live in abject poverty.

Due to the declining income of the British working people, the purchasing power of the British people has recently decreased. According to materials from the British Board of Trade Journal, retail sales of goods in April decreased by 3 percent compared to March, clothing decreased by 10 percent, and food decreased by 3 percent.

　　英人购买力下降
  　工人生活陷于赤贫
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：工人日报最近报导：管理人员、行政人员与技术人员联合会最近在伦敦举行年会，并通过决议，要求英国总工会制定其自己的物价政策及英国的全盘经济计划。与会代表猛烈抨击总工会对政府冻结工资政策所采取的策略，认为既缓慢而又笨拙。主席威廉宣称：如果不平等的牺牲继续下去，工人们是不会作更大的生产努力的。伯明翰代表胡克说，钢业工人的工资低得惊人。他说，成千的工人生活在赤贫中。
    由于英国劳动人民的收入日益减少，最近英国人民购买力已形降低。据英商务部杂志的材料，四月份的零售货物销售量较三月份降低百分之三，衣服降落百分之十，粮食降落百分之三。
