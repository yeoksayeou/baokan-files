    Comrade Xu Xiangqian, First Army Corps of the North China People's Liberation Army:
    We are extremely excited to hear about the great victory at Linfen. This once again proves that the enemy's so-called "new strategy" of stubbornly defending strongholds cannot save the final demise of the Chiang regime. The Party, government, army, and people of Northeast China are determined to continue our efforts, completely annihilate the remaining Chiang bandits in Northeast China, and liberate all of Northeast China, in order to cooperate with you in striving for the great victory of liberating all of North China.
