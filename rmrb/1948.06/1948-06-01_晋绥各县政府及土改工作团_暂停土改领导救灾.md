　　Jin Sui County Governments and Land Reform Work Groups
  　Suspend Land Reform Leadership to Focus on Disaster Relief
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 26th】The governments and land reform work groups of various counties in Jin Sui are now suspending other work to devote all their efforts to disaster relief. After the Xing County district cadre meeting, the cadres went to the countryside to ensure the sowing is completed within half a month, and at the very least not less than the cultivated area of 1946. According to the review of the county and district level meetings, county and district leaders made many mistakes in disaster relief in the past. Some comrades said, "It probably doesn't matter, people won't starve to death." There was a lack of specific organizational work for disaster relief, which led to a serious disaster situation in some areas. At the end of the meeting, all the cadres present decided to make all-out disaster relief the current urgent task. If any land is barren, or if there are cases of starvation, the local cadres should bear political responsibility. The Second District of the county has implemented centralized use of loan grain, cleaned up the fruits of struggle in the whole district, and opposed private distribution and waste. The Pinglu County Support-the-Front Committee also decided to make all-out disaster relief the guiding principle and mobilized the masses to help each other. At the same time, all Jin Sui agencies and troops continue to practice strict economy in food and clothing and actively donate money and goods in response to the Jin Sui Branch Bureau's urgent mobilization for disaster relief. The Border Region level and Xing County level agencies have donated nearly 40,000 jin of millet to the disaster-stricken people of Shenmu and Fugu, where the disaster is most severe. Personnel of the agencies under the Branch Bureau donated more than 30 shi of grain (nearly 8,000 jin), as well as clothes, shoes, and other items. The seven staff members of the Xing County Xinhua Bookstore donated a total of 560,000 agricultural currency. When the relocated disaster victims passed through Xing County, all agencies along the way provided meals to help them reach their resettlement locations.

　　晋绥各县政府及土改工作团
  　暂停土改领导救灾
    【新华社晋绥二十六日电】晋绥各县政府及土改工作团，现在暂停其他工作，以全力从事救灾。兴县县区干部会议结束后，干部分头下乡，争取半月内播种完毕，最低不得少于一九四六年耕种面积。根据县区级会议的检讨，县区领导上过去对救灾有不少错误。有的同志说：“大概不要紧，不会饿死人。”对救灾缺乏具体组织工作，致使部分地区灾情陷于严重境地。会议结束时，到会干部都决定以全力救灾为当前紧急任务。如有土地荒芜，或有饿死人现象发生，即应由各地干部负政治上的责任。该县二区已实施集中使用贷粮，清理全区斗争果实，反对私分和浪费。平鲁县支前委员会亦决定以全力救灾为方针，发动群众互济。同时晋绥各机关部队继续厉行节衣缩食，并踊跃募捐，以响应晋绥分局紧急动员救灾的号召。边区级及兴县县级机关，已捐给灾情最重之神木、府谷灾民小米近四万斤。分局所属机关人员捐出粮食三十余石（近八千斤），及衣服、鞋子等。兴县新华书店七个工作人员共捐款五十六万农币。移家的灾民经过兴县时，沿途各机关均予招待饭食，使其到达移民地点。
