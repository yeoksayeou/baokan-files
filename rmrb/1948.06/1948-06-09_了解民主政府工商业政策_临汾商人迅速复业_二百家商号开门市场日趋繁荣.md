　　Understanding the Democratic Government's Industrial and Commercial Policies
  　Linfen Merchants Quickly Resume Business
    200 Businesses Open, Market Increasingly Prosperous
    [Jin'nan Frontline, 6th Dispatch] Commerce in Linfen has rapidly recovered. By the 3rd, nearly 200 businesses in the city had opened, with goods on the counters rapidly increasing. Over 200 vendors were active in the market throughout the day. Currently, dozens of commercial buildings (not including residential buildings) in the city that were leveled by the bandit troops constructing fortifications are still being rushed for repairs. As for the East Gate, which was completely destroyed by the bandit planes' bombing, rapid restoration is more difficult. However, merchants are still standing in the rubble, cursing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits while building houses. Late into the night, they are still working diligently. Manager Zhao of the Da Dong Machine Cigarette Factory initially planned to return to Henan. Later, influenced by the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies, he is now actively repairing houses and overhauling machines, smilingly telling people, "I guarantee everyone will be smoking newly rolled cigarettes by the Dragon Boat Festival." His words are filled with endless hope. A June 1st statistic for the East Gate shows that 36 businesses have repaired their houses and opened for business, with 29 small stalls set up. The ×Tong Automobile Company has posted advertisements, offering transportation services to merchants traveling to Yuncheng. Linfen is now showing signs of prosperity.
    [Jin'nan Frontline, 4th Dispatch] After the liberation of Linfen, the democratic government, in the spirit of leniency, adopted a lenient approach to general enemy and puppet personnel, as long as they reformed themselves, thoroughly corrected their past mistakes, and were allowed to register and then regain their freedom. Fan Chongpu, the director of the puppet goods tax bureau, was still hiding everywhere for two days after liberation. Later, after learning that the democratic government was indeed lenient, he voluntarily went to the government to register. Since then, the registration office has been surrounded by puppet personnel wanting to register. From the liberation of Linfen on May 18th to the 25th, 279 enemy and puppet personnel have voluntarily registered.

　　了解民主政府工商业政策
  　临汾商人迅速复业
    二百家商号开门市场日趋繁荣
    【晋南前线六日电】临汾商业已得到迅速恢复。三日，城内已有将近二百家商号开门，各柜台的货物，迅速增多，并有二百多个摊贩，整日活跃在市面上。现在城内被匪军构筑工事平毁的几十家商房（民房不计在内），仍在继续赶修。至于被匪机轰炸得全部毁坏了的东关，迅速恢复较为困难，可是商人仍然站在瓦渣堆里，一面咒骂着蒋匪，一面盖着房子，夜静更深了，他们还在叮叮当当的干着。大东机器卷烟厂的赵经理，开始还准备返回河南，以后在民主政府工商业政策的影响下，现在正积极修补房屋，整顿机器，并笑迷迷的对人说：“保险五月节叫大家吃上新卷的纸烟。”话语中充满着无尽的希望。东关六月一日的统计：商人修好房子开门营业的，已有三十六家，摆小摊的二十九家，×通汽车公司已贴出广告，承运至运城的客商。现在临汾已呈现出繁荣的景象。
    【晋南前线四日电】临汾解放后，民主政府对于一般敌伪人员，只要改过自新，痛改前非，即本宽大精神，从轻处理，准予登记后，即恢复自由。伪货物税局主任税务员范崇朴，当解放后两日，还到处藏躲，后来打听着民主政府确实宽大，即自动跑到政府里登记，此后登记处门前整日围满要登记的伪人员。从五月十八日解放临汾开始至二十五日，自动登记的敌伪人员，已有二百七十九名。
