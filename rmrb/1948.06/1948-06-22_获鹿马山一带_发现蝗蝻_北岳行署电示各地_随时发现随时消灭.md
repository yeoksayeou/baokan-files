　　　　Locust Nymphs Discovered in Mashan Area, Huolu County
　　　　North Yue Administrative Office Cables Directives to All Regions:
　　　　Eliminate Them Whenever They Are Discovered
　　[North Yue News] Recently, locust nymphs were discovered in the Mashan area of the Second District of Huolu County, Fourth Special District. In addition to ordering the county to actively hunt and capture them, the North Yue Administrative Office also telegraphed instructions to all special districts and counties, pointing out: Currently, it is the season when locust nymphs are hatching and emerging from the soil. All regions must pay close attention to prevention and elimination. Whenever they are discovered, organize forces to completely and thoroughly eliminate them while the larvae are still slow and have not yet dispersed. It is better to temporarily affect other work than to allow them to spread and cause harm.
