　　【Lucheng News】Recently, a pest infestation was discovered in Anju Village, Fourth District. The village is very close to the Zhang River, and more than 200 mu of newly sprouted seedlings from Henan have been damaged by insects. Soybeans and corn are the most severely affected. There are two types of insects: one is a soft-bodied, long black worm, about five fen in size, which burrows in the soil around the roots of the seedlings and specializes in biting the roots; the other is a hard-winged black bug, about three fen in size, which specializes in biting the leaves and stems of the seedlings. Upon hearing the news, the county agricultural station immediately sent cadres to organize the masses to jointly study ways to eliminate the pests. The methods included: first, catching them to thoroughly eliminate them; and second, using black alum water and turpentine wine to repel them. Three teams were organized, and each person caught more than seven or eight liang of insects each time. All the women and children were in high spirits, and they proposed to continue to eliminate the pests completely. In addition to saving the seedlings that have been revived, replanting is underway in the areas with missing seedlings, and the seeds are being soaked in black alum to prevent pest infestation.

　　【Shouyang News】Recently, Shouyang has been experiencing yellow dust storms, and many fields have been infested with pests, severely damaging the grain seedlings. In the First District, Hou Yong's family in Donggou Village planted four mu of grain, which was completely eaten. Jia Bao and Ku Han also discovered similar infestations. According to current findings, there are three types of pests: the first is the "soil egg," which is the same color as the soil, making it difficult to spot when it is still. The second is the "white connecting worm," which is more than five fen long, white in color, with the thicker ones resembling hemp rope used for sewing shoe soles and the thinner ones resembling thread. The third is the "iron blue charcoal," which is black in color and about the size of a green bean plant. Among the three, the first one is the most harmful, eating along the grain rows and leaving nothing behind; the latter two eat around the grain. Farmers in the infested areas are working hard to eradicate the pests. (Cheng Zisheng, Wu Sanyuan)

　　潞城、寿阳
  　捕捉害虫抢救秋苗
    【潞城消息】四区安居村近日发现虫害，该村距漳河很近，河南刚出土的小苗，有二百余亩都被虫咬坏了。以豆类玉茭最严重。虫分两种：一类是软体黑长虫，有五分大，钻在小苗根土里，专咬苗根；另一类是硬翅黑虫，有三分大，专咬小苗叶茎。县农场闻讯当即派干部前去组织群众共同研究消灭办法。一是捕捉，彻底消灭；二是用黑矾水与柏油酒驱除。并组织了三个分队，每人捉虫一次在七、八两以上，全体妇女儿童情绪很高，他们提出要继续把虫害消灭干净。现在除救活了的小苗外，缺苗的都在进行补种，并用黑矾浸种，防止虫害。（步云、忠秀、晋祥）
    【寿阳消息】寿阳近日天刮黄风，很多地里产生了害虫，糟蹋谷苗很厉害，一区里东沟侯勇家中种谷四亩，全被吃掉；贾豹、库韩亦在发现，据现在发现的有三种：第一种土蛋子，与土的颜色相同，不动就看不出来。第二种接白虫，身有五分多长，发白色，粗者如同纳鞋底麻绳一样，细者与线相同。第三种铁蓝炭，发黑色，和菜豆棵大小相同。以上三种，前一种最为厉害，顺谷垄吃的不留一根；后两种是在谷周围吃。现有虫地区农民正努力扑灭中。（程子升、武三元）
