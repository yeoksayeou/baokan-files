　　Victory in the Battle to Protect Wheat in Northern Henan
  　Over 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Repelled
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Our Taihang troops, in conjunction with local armed forces, repelled more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 40th Division and others who attempted to seize wheat. On May 31st, elements of the 116th and 117th Regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek 40th Division in Anyang, along with Liu Lexian's bandit forces, the puppet Cixian County Security Regiment, the puppet Anyang County Security Regiment, and armed forces from various puppet village administrations, totaling over 2,000 men, invaded our Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Districts of Anyang in three routes. They attempted to occupy Qugouji and other places, establish temporary strongholds, and plunder wheat on a large scale. Along the way, they deceived the masses, saying, "The Central Army's policy has changed; we only requisition, not rob." At the same time, they robbed more than 13 *shi* of wheat from Zhanghuding and Huangputun villages. Upon hearing this news that day, our "Zhaojiazhuang" and other units, in coordination with local armed forces, launched a night attack against the invading enemy at Wutaishan and other places. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated entirely to their old lair. In this battle, we killed, wounded, and captured more than 60 enemy soldiers. Upon returning from battle, our troops worked tirelessly to help the people harvest wheat. The masses praised our army's spirit of disregarding fatigue in fighting and helping with the harvest as being "the same as working for themselves."
