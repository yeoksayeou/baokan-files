　　[Jinan News] Qinghe is preparing to control the river after the wheat harvest. With the wheat harvest approaching and autumn seedlings fully emerged, and with many mole crickets (they don't burrow after weeding), the Qinghe Xiaobao (small newspaper) calls for quickly weeding the seedlings in preparation for the wheat harvest and river control. The Xiaobao said: "The wheat harvest and river digging will take up half a month or twenty days. If the seedlings are not weeded before the wheat harvest, or not weeded well, the land will be wasted. We must quickly drop other work and concentrate on weeding the seedlings. In Xizhangkuan Village, District One, the sorghum and cotton have already been weeded for the first time. On the evening of the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the village chief called on the masses at a meeting to quickly weed the land. He said: "The wheat is ripening soon, and our county will be controlling the river after the wheat harvest, so there will be no time to work. Now that the wheat is not ripe and the river is not being controlled, it's a free time. We must ensure that the wheat fields are weeded twice, so that we can harvest the wheat well and control the river after the wheat harvest!" Farm member Liu Xinyu said: "What the village chief said is right! If we don't weed now, and then the wheat harvest and river control come, won't the land be wasted!" The next day, the masses all went to the fields to weed the seedlings for the second time, preparing to welcome the wheat harvest and river control.

　　准备迎接麦收治河
  　清河动员赶快锄苗
    【冀南消息】清河准备麦后治河，麦收快到，秋苗已出全，蝼蛄又多（锄后蝼蛄不拱），清河小报号召迎接麦收和治河赶快锄苗，小报上说：“麦收和挖河一闹腾就得半月廿天，如果麦前苗锄不过来，或锄不好，地就得荒了。要赶快扔下别的活突击锄苗。一区西张宽村高粱棉花都锄过头遍了，四月初八日晚村长在群众会上号召赶快锄地，他说：“麦子快熟，过了麦咱县要治河，就没空干活了，现在麦子没熟，河又没治，正是个空儿，麦头里要保证锄了二遍，好割麦子，过了麦好治河！”农会员刘心玉说：“村长说的真对！现在不锄，一过麦一治河，不把地荒啦！”第二天群众都到地里锄二遍苗，准备迎接过麦治河。
