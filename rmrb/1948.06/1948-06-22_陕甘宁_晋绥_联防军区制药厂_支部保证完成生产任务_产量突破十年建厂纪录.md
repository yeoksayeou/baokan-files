Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 19th: Communist Party members of a certain pharmaceutical factory in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan Allied Defense Region, under the leadership of the branch, united the masses with exemplary actions, completed and exceeded production tasks, and became the core of mobilizing workers to promote production. Compared with January, the factory's output in April increased six and a half times for various cardiotonic injections, doubled for various analgesic injections, and increased two to three times for various oral powders and pills for cough relief, pain relief, and stomach strengthening. In the May competition, output rose even more rapidly, breaking the record of the past ten years since the factory was built. They paid attention to improving technology and saving raw materials. The gauze made by the materials group in the past could not absorb water due to incomplete degreasing. Party member Zhang Guangde studied and improved the degreasing method and degreasing stoves; this not only made the finished product better but also reduced the production time by two-thirds and saved one-third of the coal. Mi Guang, a Party member in the glass group, discovered that the alkalinity in the glass was too high, and the ampoules (small glass bottles for holding injection drugs) produced were of poor quality, easily causing the drug to precipitate when stored. He studied carefully and reduced the alkalinity to the lowest limit. The traditional Chinese medicine group originally ground medicinal powder by grinding first and then sifting, and the remaining medicinal residue was often lost. Party member Li Qinglin learned the method of grinding rice flour from the common people, grinding and sifting at the same time, repeatedly grinding and sifting, which can both reduce one procedure and save raw materials. In addition to working hard and studying technology themselves, Party members also helped and promoted non-Party workers and apprentices in various ways. For example, Li Zhengyi, a Party member of the ampoule group, often used his spare time to tell the group about his three years of painstaking experience, cultivating the group's workers to learn techniques such as infusion preparation, distillation, and furnace melting. For individual workers with incorrect work attitudes, he tried to educate them and urged them to correct them. For example, worker Chen Zhigang was always unwilling to learn and did not get up early in the morning. Li Zhengyi still took care of him in every possible way and constantly persuaded him patiently, so that Chen Zhigang gradually felt embarrassed himself, got up every day at dawn, and participated in collective learning. Zhang Guangde, a Party member of the materials group, paid attention to the progress of each non-Party worker, often contributing to the wall newspaper to commend workers who were active in their work and worked hard in their studies, uniting all members of the group, so that the group automatically proposed to complete the arduous plan of exceeding the highest production record in the past by 25% in the May competition. Due to the exemplary actions of the Party members, a large number of activists emerged among the workers. The Party branch absorbed more than ten new Party members, such as Wang Baoren and Dongfang Ming, in the actual test of production, and made the non-Party workers more closely united around the branch, making the branch the core of promoting production.

  　支部保证完成生产任务
    产量突破十年建厂纪录
    【新华社西北十九日电】陕甘宁晋绥联防军区某制药工厂共产党员，在支部领导下以模范行动团结群众，完成并超过生产任务，成为发动工人推动生产的核心。该厂产量四月份与一月份相较，各种强心注射剂增产六倍半，各种镇痛注射剂增产两倍，各种内服之止咳、止痛、健胃等药粉、药丸均增产两倍至三倍。五月竞赛中，产量更飞速上升，突破建厂十年以来的纪录。他们注意改进技术、节省原料。材料组过去所制纱布，因脱脂不净，不能吸水，党员张光德即加以研究，改进了脱脂方法及脱脂锅灶；不仅使成品良好，而且减少了三分之二的制作时间，节省了三分之一的石炭。玻璃组党员密光发现玻璃中咸性过大，制出的安瓿（即盛针药的小玻璃瓶）质地不好，盛药时容易使药剂沉淀。他即细心钻研，结果使咸性减至最低限度。中药组碾制药粉原是先碾后箩，剩余药渣经常损失。党员李庆林即学习老百姓碾米粉方法，边碾边箩，反复碾箩，既可减少一道手续，又能节省原料。党员们除自己刻苦工作钻研技术外，并多方帮助推动非党工人学徒。如安瓿组党员李正义，时常在工余的时间向本组讲述自己三年苦心所得的经验，培养该组工人学会灌注配剂、蒸溜、熔炉等技术。个别有不正确劳动态度的工人，他则设法加以教育，促其改正，如工人陈志刚一向不愿学习，早上不起床，李正义对他仍然多方照顾，并不断耐心加以说服，使陈志刚渐渐自己感到不好意思，每天天亮就起床，并且参加了集体学习，材料组党员张光德注意每个非党工人的进步，经常给壁报投稿表扬工作积极、努力学习的工人，团结了全组人员，使该组工人在五月竞赛中，自动提出要完成超出以往最高生产纪录百分之二十五的艰巨计划。由于党员的模范行动，使工人中涌现出大批积极分子，党的支部就在生产的实际考验中，吸收了王保仁，东方明等十余位新党员，并使得非党工人更紧密的团结在支部周围，使支部形成了推动生产的核心。
