Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. TASS reports: *Pravda's* international commentator, on the 6th, wrote an article commenting on the secret agreements of the London Six-Nation Conference, declaring that the London secret agreement will never be recognized by peace-loving countries, nor will it be recognized by the German people. The German people are expressing their protest against the division of Germany and demanding to ensure Germany's unity through a plebiscite signature campaign on the question of German unification. In contrast to political conspiracies like the despicable London division secret agreement, the Soviet Union has always firmly sought post-war peace in accordance with previously adopted international agreements. The commentator wrote that the American ruling clique is the mastermind behind this violation of the Potsdam Agreement. The French delegation succumbed to the demands made by the American representative, Douglas. During the Council of Foreign Ministers' discussions on the German question, the French delegation abandoned the Yalta and Potsdam policies and joined the camp hostile to such policies, and is now tasting the bitter fruit of its shortsightedness; as for the broad French people, they believe that the London resolution is a betrayal of the French national interest.

　　苏真理报评六国会议
    伦敦密约永远不会被爱好和平的国家和德国人民所承认
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社讯：真理报国际评论员于六日著文评论伦敦六国会议的密约时宣称，伦敦密约永远不会被爱好和平的国家所承认，它也不会被德国人民所承认。德国人民正经过关于德国统一问题的复决签名来表示他们对分裂德国的抗议，并要求确保德国的统一。与卑劣的伦敦分裂密约这类政治阴谋相反，苏联始终坚决按照前此间通过的国际协定觅取战后和平。评论员文称，美国统治集团是这一违犯波茨顿决议勾当的后台老板，法国代表团在美国代表道格拉斯所提出的要求面前屈服了，在外长会议讨论德国问题期间，法国代表团放弃了雅尔塔与波茨顿的政策，投到与这种政策为敌的阵营中，如今它正尝着自己短视的苦果；至于广大的法国人民，他们认为伦敦决议是背叛法国民族利益的。
