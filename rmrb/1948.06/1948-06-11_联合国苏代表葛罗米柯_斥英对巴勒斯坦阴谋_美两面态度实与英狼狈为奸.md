Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. New York dispatch: Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Gromyko, vehemently denounced Britain's conspiracy in Palestine at the Security Council on the 29th of last month, and pointed out that the United States and Britain were actually colluding. At the Security Council meeting that day, after the Soviet Union's proposal to invoke the UN Charter to enforce a ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish sides was rejected, the British proposal, which favored the Arab countries, was put to a vote and was ultimately passed with a formal "amendment" by the United States and France. The core content of this case is to "order the Arab and Jewish sides to cease fire in Palestine for four weeks starting at 11:00 PM standard time on June 1st, and to prohibit all arms and recruits from being transported to Israel and the seven Arab countries during the ceasefire." In his speech before the vote, Gromyko vehemently denounced the British proposal as illegal because it violated the UN General Assembly's partition decision and would increase bloodshed in Palestine. Gromyko pointed out that the purpose of the British proposal was only to use it to restrain the State of Israel, allowing the Arab countries to carry out further aggression. Britain was currying favor with the Arab countries in order to advance its imperialist interests in the Middle East. Britain is merely a "wolf in sheep's clothing," opposing the interests of the Arab people and opposing their independence. On the other hand, Gromyko also declared: "The Soviet Union has always steadfastly supported the legitimate aspirations of the Arab nations to strive for genuine independence free from foreign interference."

The United States once again adopted a two-faced attitude and unprincipled stance in this meeting. Although the United States agreed with most of the Soviet Union's proposals, and even condemned the Arab countries' aggression against Palestine the day before, it not only did not vote in favor of the Soviet Union's supplementary proposal that "the Arab countries are clearly refusing the Security Council's ceasefire order of the 22nd", but when Colombia proposed that the ceasefire period in the British proposal should be canceled, it even publicly echoed Britain and opposed it. At the same time, the United States also colluded with France to propose a series of amendments in an attempt to put a false mask on the British proposal. US Representative Austin suggested that the arms and recruit embargo to Palestine should be extended to the seven Arab countries. This suggestion was actually harmless to the Arab countries, because they had already accumulated a large amount of war materials and equipment. This was just an attempt to find an excuse to maintain the US's unilateral arms embargo to Israel. Gromyko condemned Austin's amendment as merely an empty farce, and the section on expanding the embargo was particularly "most undesirable".

　　联合国苏代表葛罗米柯
  　斥英对巴勒斯坦阴谋
    美两面态度实与英狼狈为奸
    【新华社陕北七日电】纽约讯：苏联驻联合国代表葛罗米柯于上月二十九日在安理会上严词斥责英国在巴勒斯坦的阴谋，并指出美国与英国在实际上狼狈为奸。在当日的安理会上，苏联所提援用联合国宪章，强制阿犹双方停战的建议被否决后，偏袒阿剌伯国家的英国提案，便提付表决，该案经美法形式上的“修正”，终获通过。此案中心内容，即“下令阿剌伯与犹太双方于六月一日标准时间下午十一时起，在巴勒斯坦停战四星期、停战期间禁止一切军火与壮丁运往以色列与七阿剌伯国家”。葛罗米柯在其表决前的演说中，痛斥英国提案为不合法。因为它违反联大分治的决定，并将增加巴境的流血。葛氏指出：英国提案的目的，仅在以此束缚以色列国，让阿剌伯国家放手进行进一步的侵略。英国是在向阿剌伯国家讨好，以求增进它在中东的帝国主义利益。英国只是“披了羊皮的狼”，它反对阿剌伯人民的利益，反对他们的独立。另一方面，葛氏同时宣称：“苏联始终不渝地支持阿剌伯民族争取不受外国干涉的真正独立的合法愿望”。
    美国在这次会议中，再度采取了两面态度与无原则立场，虽然美国同意苏联建议的大部分，而且前一天还在谴责阿剌伯国家侵略巴勒斯坦，但它不仅没有投票赞成苏联所提“明白宣布拒绝安理会二十二日停战令的是阿剌伯国家”这一个补充案，而且当哥伦比亚提出英国提案中的停战期限应予取消时，它甚至公然附和英国而予以反对。同时美国还串通法国，提出了一连串的修正企图，为英国提案加上一个假面具。美国代表奥斯汀提议禁运军火与壮丁至巴勒斯坦，应扩大至七个阿剌伯国家，这一建议实际上对阿剌伯国家有利无害，因为它们业已积存了大量战争物资和装备，这只是企图为保持美国片面禁运军火至以色列寻找借口。葛氏斥责奥斯汀的修正案只是空无一物的丑态，而关于扩大禁运的这一节，尤其是“最要不得”。
