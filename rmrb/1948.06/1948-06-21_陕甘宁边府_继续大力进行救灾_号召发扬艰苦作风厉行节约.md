　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government
  　Continues Vigorous Disaster Relief Efforts
  　Calls for Promoting Hard Work and Thrift
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government continues to vigorously carry out disaster relief. Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Region Government, and Vice Chairmen Yang Mingxuan and Liu Jingfan issued an emergency notice on June 6, calling on all levels of organs, troops, schools, and governments in the border region to immediately mobilize extensively to organize a thrift and disaster relief campaign, with each person saving one or two taels of millet per day to help the disaster-stricken people through the critical period of about one month before the summer harvest (wheat harvesting in northern Shaanxi is later, generally around the beginning of the sixth lunar month). The notice instructed cadres and service personnel at all levels to maintain and promote a spirit of hard work, actively engage in production, practice strict economy, and rigorously criticize and correct the peace-enjoyment ideology and extravagant and wasteful behaviors that are divorced from the masses. The border region also allocated more than 1,800 shi of grain for emergency relief (some of which were loans), bringing the total amount of relief grain distributed to 18,690 shi; in addition, 400,000 yuan (border region currency, currently one yuan of border region currency equals seven to ten yuan of Chiang's currency) was issued in agricultural loans. The allocation of this relief grain includes 500 shi for the Suide sub-region; 50 shi for Yan'an City (40 shi of which is for rice relief for the construction of the Nanguan River dam), and 50 million yuan in agricultural currency; 500 shi for Yanchuan County; 600 shi for Zichang (i.e., Anding) County; and 200 shi for the Jungar Banner of the Yikezhao League (liberated in mid-April). Wang Ziyi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government and Director of the Border Region Disaster Relief Headquarters, also personally went to the Suide sub-region, which was more severely affected by the disaster, in late May to inspect the work. It is reported that the sub-region has dispatched cadres to the countryside to effectively supervise disaster relief work. The nine immigration stations on the Sui (de) - Yan (an) road have been formally established to receive immigrants from the south; ＠ County's county to village is also making various preparations for resettling immigrants. The second batch of disaster relief inspectors sent by the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government to the disaster area departed on the 7th of this month. The staff of Yan'an City have unanimously decided to save two jin of millet per person per month for disaster relief.
