(JiluYu News) Democratic Discussion in Gaoling Mudan Street: Rationally Resolving the Issue of Support Labor and Substitute Farming
　　The entire village of Mudan Street in Gaoling has 248 households with a population of 958. There are 71 households of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs. Each laborer originally had 18 mu of land. In the past, substitute farming meant that all the livestock bore the burden of plowing land for the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs. The 71 households of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs originally had a total of 1,093 mu of land, with each animal bearing the burden of approximately 20 mu of the land belonging to military dependents and revolutionary martyrs. Adding their own 20+ mu of land, each animal had to bear the burden of 40 to 50 mu. Most households in the village shared livestock between two families, so each pair of animals had to bear the burden of nearly 100 mu. If they were small animals, there was no way they could cultivate that much land, and they also had to prioritize cultivating the land for the families of soldiers resisting the enemy. Households with livestock all wanted to sell their animals. As for the Self-Defense Forces' substitute farming, they sent as many people as were needed. The Self-Defense Forces reflected that the burden was heavy, and the families of soldiers resisting the enemy who had labor power did not cultivate their land, and those who had livestock wanted to sell them, asking others to do the substitute farming. Regarding the issue of support labor, in the past, the 17 village cadres did not participate in substitute farming, and neither did the militiamen go on duty. We turned over the opinions on support labor and substitute farming to the masses for discussion, and the results were: (1) Regarding the issue of support labor: the village chief and the finance and grain committee members would not provide labor support, and everyone else would. Militiamen going on duty would be counted as labor support, village cadres attending meetings in the district would be counted as labor support, and when livestock went on duty, the owner would go with the livestock and it would be counted as labor support. All labor support would be recorded. The Self-Defense Forces age was 18 to 45 years old. (2) The households of widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless would not have substitute farming. A rental system would be adopted, finding relatives and close neighbors. The rent would be negotiated between the two parties. If they couldn't find anyone themselves, the production committee would introduce someone. Families of soldiers resisting the enemy who had labor power must participate in labor, and there would be no substitute farming. If they had little labor power and couldn't cultivate all their land, only then would there be substitute farming. If they had a lot of land, they should buy livestock. If they did not buy livestock, they had to give grass to the livestock that did the substitute farming. Families of soldiers resisting the enemy with no labor power must have free substitute farming. Later, a meeting of families of soldiers resisting the enemy was held to mobilize them. On the spot, 17 families reported that they did not need substitute farming. Some families reported that they did not need substitute farming for part of their land, reducing the total amount of land requiring substitute farming by 675 mu. The remaining 41 households needed substitute farming for a total of 418 mu, thus reducing the amount of land requiring substitute farming by more than 60%. The issue of support labor and substitute farming was discussed by small groups for two or three days, and then by the group leaders. The result was that, apart from the families of soldiers resisting the enemy who had no labor power, there were 114 people left who needed to provide substitute farming for the families of soldiers resisting the enemy. Apart from the livestock of families of soldiers resisting the enemy, there were 34 livestock left who needed to do the substitute farming. The land was distributed according to specific households, with each person receiving 2.5 mu of land, and each animal being equivalent to 1.5 people. Small animals were each assigned 3.75 mu of land. The remaining land was added to the large animals, but the maximum for a large animal was no more than 4.5 mu. Thus, households with livestock, with two people and two animals, were assigned 12 mu of land, which could be plowed in three days. Households without livestock, with two people, were assigned 5 mu of land, which would take four days to plow. Everyone started arguing again, feeling that the households with livestock were getting an advantage. It was decided to distribute the distant land to the households with livestock. It was also decided that families of soldiers resisting the enemy could freely find substitute farming households. Families of soldiers resisting the enemy who had no labor power but only livestock would help with labor, and cultivating 2 mu would count as 1 mu. Households without livestock reflected: "This method is the best! Substitute farming is our task. Two mu of land can be done in an evening! We can combine freely and push the manure to the fields during the afternoon rest!" Households with livestock said: "This way, we don't have to sell the livestock! It's nothing for two households to cultivate more than ten mu of land. Our families can grind the grain and do some processing!" Immediately, three households exchanged for better livestock, and only two representatives of the families of soldiers resisting the enemy were not satisfied because in the past their land was completely cultivated by others, and they did not work themselves. The issue of support labor was discussed by small groups. In the future, support labor would be recorded in a public account, with the secretary responsible for registration. Those aged 15 to 18 would be in the youth class, those aged 50 to 60 would be in the elderly class, and those aged 45 to 50 would be considered semi-labor. The elderly and youth classes could go on short, light duty. Full laborers and semi-laborers would be credited the same amount of work, but the light and heavy duties would differ by a factor of one. The village cadres and militiamen were initially unwilling to go on duty. After calculating the accounts for the village cadres, it turned out that only one or two cadres were very busy. Although some were cadres, they didn't have much to do all day, and they themselves felt it was unreasonable not to go on duty. Initially, the militiamen wanted to hand over their guns and quit. After mobilizing them to compare the lightness and heaviness of carrying stretchers on duty with the peasants, the militiamen were given more work credit. The militiamen thought it was not a loss and agreed.

　　高陵牡丹街民主讨论
  　合理解决支差代耕问题
    【冀鲁豫消息】高陵牡丹街全村二百四十八户，人九百五十八口，军工烈属七十一户，每个劳力合原有地十八亩，过去代耕是牲口全部负担给军工烈属犁地，七十一户军工烈属，共原有地一千零九十三亩，每个牲口负担军工烈属地约廿余亩。再加上自己的地二十多亩，则每个牲口负担达四十亩到五十亩。该村多是两家合一犋使，这样每犋牲口两个，负担近一百亩，有两个小牲口，无论如何是种不起来的，又得先给抗属种。有牲口户都要求要卖牲口。自卫队代耕，则是需要几个派几个。自卫队反映差重，抗属有劳力也不种，有牲口也要卖了，叫人家代耕。支差问题，过去十七个村干，不参加代耕，民兵也不出差。我们将支差代耕的意见交给群众讨论，结果是：（一）支差问题：村长及财粮委员不支差，其余一律支差，民兵出发算差，村干到区开会算差，牲口出差主人随牲口出发算差，出差都记帐；自卫队年龄十八岁至四十五岁。（二）鳏寡孤独户不代耕，采取租佃方式，找亲戚近门，租子双方协商。自己找不到时，生产委员会给介绍。抗属有劳力的，必须参加劳动，不代耕。如劳力少种不了的土地，才代耕。地多应买牲口的要买牲口，不买牲口的，要把草给代耕牲口吃。无劳力的抗属，必须无代价的代耕。以后又召开抗属会议，动员了一下，当场有十七户抗属，自报不用代耕。又有些户一部分土地不用代耕，共计减少代耕地六百七十五亩。剩下需要代耕的四十一户，共地四百一十八亩，这样便减少代耕地百分之六十多。支差代耕问题，经小组两三天的酝酿，和组长会讨论，结果是除了抗属没劳力外，下剩一百一十四人，需给抗属代耕，除抗属牲口外，下剩三十四个牲口须代耕，把地按具体户分配，一个人力分地二亩半，一个牲口顶一个半人力，小牲口每个分地三亩七分五。这样还剩几亩地加到大牲口上去。但大牲口最多不超过四亩半。这样有牲口户，两户两个人两个牲口，分地十二亩，犁地三天可完，不喂牲口户两人分地五亩，垡地得四天。大家又争论起来，感觉有牲口的沾光，研究将远地分给有牲口户，又决定抗属可自由找代耕户，没劳力只有牲口的抗属帮人工，种二亩算一亩。没有牲口的户反映：“这法最好啦。代耕是咱的任务，二亩多地打个黄昏就做啦！咱自由结合歇晌时把粪都推到地里啦！”喂牲口户说：“这样牲口不用卖啦！两户多种十多亩地不算啥，家里人推推磨加加工就做啦！”随即有三户换了好牲口，只有两个抗属代表不满意。因为以前他们的地完全是叫人家代耕，自己不劳动。支差问题经过小组酝酿，今后支差立公帐，由书记负责登记，十五岁至十八岁为少年班，五十岁至六十岁为老年班，四十五岁至五十岁为半劳力。老少年班可以出短轻差，整劳力与半劳力一样记工，但轻重要差一倍。村干民兵对一律出差开始打不通，经过给村干算了算帐，结果只一、二个干部忙的很。虽然有的当干部，整天没啥事，自己也感到不支差不合理。开始民兵要交枪不干，经过动员叫和农民抬担架出差比一比那轻那重，民兵出发工多了还批工，民兵一想不吃亏也通了。
