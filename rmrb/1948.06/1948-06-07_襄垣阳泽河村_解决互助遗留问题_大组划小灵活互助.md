  　Resolving Issues Left Over from Mutual Aid
  　Dividing Large Groups into Smaller, Flexible Mutual Aid Units
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In Yangze River Village, Xiangyuan District 1, the Li Changfu mutual aid group reorganized before the spring plowing and sowing, resolving issues left over from last year's mutual aid. The group leader reviewed his lack of responsibility and democracy in leading the group last year. He said, "I was the only one who decided who went to work at whose home. Some wages haven't been settled even now, and some people have suffered losses." Everyone said, "The group leader certainly made mistakes, but we also have faults to review. We didn't raise our opinions; this is a problem for all of us." Immediately, the group settled the outstanding wages, paying what was due. After resolving the wage issue, group leader Li Changfu said, "This year's mutual aid must be thoroughly democratic and truly voluntary. Do all the people in the group from last year still want to work together in mutual aid this year?" Yang Niuhai said, "It's good to work together, but there are too many people. For example, last year, when a group of people worked in one field, the work was delayed! This year, let our large group set a plan and promote it, dividing into three smaller groups to work. What do you think?" Everyone agreed with this suggestion. Then, they voluntarily combined into three groups, seven people in each group, totaling twenty-one people. Wang Qinglao was elected as the large group leader, responsible for promotion. Finally, everyone set out a plan: (1) Implement a work point system, dividing the day into nine work periods (two in the morning, four in the afternoon, and three in the evening). (2) Evaluate and convert work points on the spot according to the work, with good and fast work rated as first-class, worth eleven work periods a day; second-class, nine work periods; and third-class, eight work periods. (3) Settle accounts every half month, and the grain must be paid. (4) Hold a small group review meeting every five days, and a large group review meeting every half month, praising advantages and correcting shortcomings.
    After setting the plan, groups challenged each other. The large group has thirteen full laborers, eight semi-laborers, three mules, one cow, and one donkey. Within forty days, they have completed all land preparation and sowing. The whole group has 16.5 mu of foreign cotton, and has already thinned the seedlings three times, hoed the seedlings twice, and applied topdressing fertilizer once. They are currently in the process of hoeing for the third time. (Farmers' Daily)

  　解决互助遗留问题
  　大组划小灵活互助
    【本报消息】襄垣一区阳泽河村李长富互助组，在此次春耕下种前重新整顿互助，解决去年互助中遗留问题。组长检讨去年在组内领导不负责任，也不民主，不管到谁家动弹，由我一人调动，到现在还有工资没清了，有的人吃了亏。大家说：“组长固然有错，咱们检讨起来也有错，有意见不提，这是咱大家的毛病。”当下把组内的工资米拨清，该出的出，该得的得，工资问题解决后，组长李长富又说：“今年互助要做到彻底民主，真正自愿，去年全组的人，今年是不是还愿在一块互助？”杨牛孩说：“在一块互助倒好，就是人多，比如去年一组人到一块地里做活，就背了工啦！今年咱大组订计划推动，分成三个小组做活，大家看可以不可以。”大家都赞成这个意见。接着自愿结合碰成三个小组，每组七人共廿一人，选出王庆劳是大组组长，负责推动。最后大家订出计划：（一）实行工票制度，一天分九晌（早二午四晚三）。（二）就地按活评工折工，做活好又快如一等一天顶十一晌，二等九晌、三等八晌。（三）半月算一次帐，必须把米交清。（四）每五天一次小组检讨会，半月一次大组检讨会，优点表扬缺点纠正。
    订计划后，组与组又提出挑战，大组全劳力十三人，半劳力八人、骡三头、牛一头、驴一头。四十天内已全部完成修地下种，全组有洋棉花十六亩五分，已拣苗三次，锄苗两次，上追肥一次，现正在锄三次中。（农民报）
