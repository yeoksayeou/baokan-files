　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. The Vietnamese people, who are commemorating the thousandth day of their resistance, have a glorious history of over seventy years in fighting against the brutal colonial rule of French imperialism. However, it was not until the establishment of the Vietnamese Communist Party led by Ho Chi Minh in 1930 that the Vietnamese people had their own strong leader. The Vietnamese Communist Party pointed out the correct and firm direction of struggle for the Vietnamese people and organized the people to engage in combat. On June 22, 1940, when French imperialism shamelessly surrendered to the German Kou, the Vietnamese people, under the call of the Vietnamese Communist Party, actively prepared for a grand anti-Japanese alliance, opposed France's betrayal of Vietnam, and opposed the invasion of the Japanese Kou. In September of that year, the Japanese Kou occupied Vietnam. Several months later, in early 1941, under the call and leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party, various patriotic parties and national salvation organizations in Vietnam (including the Vietnamese Communist Party, the Vietnamese Democratic Party, the New Vietnam Party, the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League, and anti-Japanese organizations from the industrial, agricultural, commercial, and academic circles) jointly formed the Vietnam Independence League (abbreviated as Viet Minh), uniting and leading all the Vietnamese people to fight for anti-Japanese resistance, freedom, independence, and democracy. The Viet Minh's People's Army made important contributions to the Allied anti-fascist war of liberation in the Far East. Following the surrender of the Japanese Kou, the Viet Minh Provisional Military Government, established in the summer of 1944, announced the independence of the Vietnamese nation on August 19, 1945. On August 28 of the same month, Emperor Bao Dai abdicated. On September 2, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed. In October 1946, the democratically elected National Assembly of Vietnam passed the Republic's constitution and elected Ho Chi Minh as the first president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. A young democratic republic emerged on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia.
　　
    The young republic was born in the flames of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal warfare and had been tempered by it. On September 23, 1945, French imperialism, with the armed support of the United States and the support of British and Japanese troops, launched a war of aggression, forcibly occupied Saigon, and attempted to turn Vietnam back into a French colony. The Vietnamese people had no choice but to rise up and wage a national self-defense war. The war of aggression brought terrible consequences to French imperialism. By the end of last year, its troop losses (casualties and desertions) had reached more than 68,000, and it was paying about one million US dollars in war expenses every day. However, under the leadership of the Viet Minh, the Vietnamese people became stronger and stronger after land reform and other democratic reforms. The Viet Minh People's Army had grown from 20,000 in 1945 to 200,000 to 300,000 in 1947. More people formed guerrillas and militia, so that the points and lines occupied by the French aggressors were constantly under the widespread attack of people's guerrilla warfare. The French invading army was short of troops, exhausted, and demoralized. Under these circumstances, with the authorization of the United States, the French imperialists created a puppet regime (i.e., the Nguyen Van Xuan government), attempting to achieve its aggressive purposes through political means of "using Vietnamese to control Vietnamese." But this did not weaken, but rather strengthened, the will of the Vietnamese people to fight for independence and freedom.

　　英勇的越盟
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】正在纪念其抗战千日的越南人民，为反抗法帝国主义的残暴殖民统治，已有七十余年的光荣斗争史。但直到一九三○年以胡志明为首的越南共产党成立之后，越南人民才有了自己的坚强领导者。越南共产党为越南人民指出了正确而坚定的斗争方向，并组织人民从事战斗。一九四○年六月二十二日，当法帝国主义向德寇无耻投降时，越南人民即在越共号召下积极准备抗日的大联合，反对法国出卖越南，反对日寇的入侵，是年九月，日寇侵占越南。数月之后，即一九四一年初，在越共号召与领导之下，越南各爱国党派与各救亡团体（包括越共、越南民主党，新越南党、越南革命青年同盟、以及工、农、商、学各界的抗日团体等），共同组成了越南独立同盟（简称越盟），团结和领导全体越南人民，为抗日、自由、独立、民主而奋斗，越盟的人民军，在远东同盟国反法西斯解放战争中，作了重要的贡献。随着日寇的投降，一九四四年夏成立的越盟临时军政府，于一九四五年八月十九日宣布越南民族独立。同月二十八日，越王保大逊位。九月二日，越南民主共和国宣告诞生。一九四六年十月，越南民选的国民议会，通过了共和国宪法，并选举胡志明为越南民主共和国首任总统。一个年青的民主共和国，便出现于东南亚的印度支那半岛上。
    年青的共和国是在反帝反封建的战火中诞生，并经受了锻炼的。一九四五年九月二十三日，法帝国主义在美国供给武装与英军及日寇的支持之下，发动侵略战争，强占西贡，妄图再沦越南为法国的殖民地。越南人民不得不奋起进行民族自卫战争。侵略战争给法帝国主义带来了可怕的结果，迄去年底止，它损失的兵员（伤亡和逃亡）已达六万八千余人，每日支付战费约达一百万美元。但是，在越盟领导下的越南人民，经过土地改革与其他民主改革之后，愈战愈强。越盟人民军自一九四五年的两万人，已生长至一九四七年的二、三十万人。更多的人民则组成游击队与民兵，使法国侵略者所占领的点线，经常处于人民游击战争的广泛袭击下。法侵略军则兵力不足，疲于奔命，士气不振。在这种情形之下，经过美国的授意，法帝国主义者就制造了一个傀儡政权）即阮文春政府），企图用政治上的“以越制越”办法，达到它的侵略目的。但是这并没有减弱反而是更加加强了越南人民为独立自由而斗争的意志。
    越南与我国广东、广西、云南接壤，它的面积比法国本土大三分之一，两倍于我国河北省。共有人口二千三百万其中有华侨五十万。
