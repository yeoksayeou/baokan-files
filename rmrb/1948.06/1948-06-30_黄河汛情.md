　　Yellow River Flood Situation
    The Yellow River will enter the flood season on July 7th. Before the major flood, around the wheat harvest, the Yellow River is traditionally at its lowest point. In mid-May this year, the water level below the third dam of the Fanpo dangerous work section in the Xu (翼) District was three meters two inches lower than the highest water level during last year's major flood. The current top of the levee is two meters higher than last year's highest water level, and five meters two inches higher than the current water level. The Yellow River's pattern is that there is a particularly large flood every five or nine years. Last year's flood was particularly small, and it is generally estimated that this year's flood may be large.

　　黄河汛情
    黄河将于七月七日进入汛期。黄河在大汛前夕麦收前后，历来是水势最小的时候。今年五月中旬，徐翼段范坡险工第三坝下的水位，比去年大汛期间最高水位低三公尺二寸。现在的堤顶比去年的最高水位高二公尺。高出现在水位五公尺二寸。黄河规律是五年或九年就有一次特大的水，去年的水特别小，一般人估计今年的水可能大。
