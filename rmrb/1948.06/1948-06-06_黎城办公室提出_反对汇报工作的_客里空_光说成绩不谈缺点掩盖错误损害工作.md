Licheng Joint Office Proposes
Rejecting the "Empty Talk" in Work Reports
Only Reporting Achievements, Not Discussing Shortcomings, Covering Up Mistakes Harms Work

To the Editor:

From the recent materials from various base villages, there is a tendency to only write about the correct aspects of the work process. When deviations and erroneous practices occur during the entire work process, they are always hesitant and unwilling to promptly reveal the truth. For example, in the Party rectification in Hongjing Village, a representative hit the Party branch secretary, and the work team committed tailism. However, the Party rectification material is written as follows: "During the Party rectification, democracy was promoted at all times, and the attitude of the Party member representatives was corrected. Individual representatives had improper attitudes of personal revenge. Democratic forces were used to criticize them, and the leadership had individual talks, so that the movement did not take a detour, and the Party rectification developed smoothly..." According to the Party rectification material, the work team did not engage in tailism or take over the work, but correctly implemented the Party rectification guidelines and policies, and the deviations were not written out. Another example is in the Party rectification in Beisanglu, where a representative held a stick and grabbed a Party member by the collar, scaring the Party member into wetting his pants. Such deviations that occurred during the Party rectification have never been reflected. The Wangjiazhuang work team registered the property of middle peasants door-to-door, causing ideological turmoil among the middle peasants. A special letter was sent to inquire about this matter, but has not been answered to this day. Class differentiation in Dongguan has already shown deviations. During self-reporting and public discussion, middle-peasant families had to carefully state how much grain they had, how many quilts, how many feet of cloth they had woven, and even the furniture, pots, and pans. They were even asked how many silver dollars they had. If the middle peasants did not say, the poor and hired peasants would press them, forming panic and fear among the middle-peasant class in the class differentiation. Sometimes the questioning became a stalemate, and only one household was classified in one night. The material for classifying him was very simple, and the true situation could not be understood. Some comrades in the work team still have the mistaken idea that "left" is better than right, and they have not examined this in their self-criticism. If such a dishonest attitude towards the Party and the work prevents timely communication between higher and lower levels, and deviations and shortcomings cannot be corrected in time, the work will suffer great losses. Every working comrade should have the courage to speak out the truth in the work, not hide the shortcomings in their work, and not embellish reality. Only in this way can the deviations in our work be corrected in time. (Licheng Joint Office)

### 黎城办公室提出　反对汇报工作的“客里空”  光说成绩不谈缺点掩盖错误损害工作

　　黎城办公室提出
  　反对汇报工作的“客里空”
    光说成绩不谈缺点掩盖错误损害工作
    编辑同志：
    从各基点村最近来的材料中看，有这样偏向，只是把工作过程中的正确一方面写出来了，在整个工作的过程中发生了偏向与错误的做法，总是吞吞吐吐，不想及时把真情揭发出来。如洪井村整党中代表打支书，工作组犯了尾巴主义，但整党材料是这样写的：“在整党中时刻发扬民主，摆正党员代表态度，有个别代表私人报复态度不端正，用民主力量来批评他，领导上个别谈话，使运动没有走了弯路，整党顺利发展……。”从整党材料看，工作组不是尾巴包办，是正确的执行了整党方针和政策，偏向是没有写出来的。又如北桑鲁整党中，代表手持棍杆抓住党员领口，吓的党员屙裤屎。这样整党中发生的偏向，始终没有反映过。王家庄工作组挨户登记中农财产，引起中农思想动荡，专门去信问这件事，直到现在未答复。东关划阶级已发生了偏向，自报公议时，中农家有多少粮食几条被子，织了几丈布，家具锅碗都得细细说说，甚而追问有几元银洋，中农不说，贫雇追问不行，形成了划阶级中中农阶层恐慌害怕，有时追问形成僵局，一晚上只划了一户。和他要划阶级材料却很简单，不能了解真象。有的工作组同志直到现在思想上还存在着“左”比右强的错误想法，在检讨中并未检讨出来。如果这样的对党对工作不老实态度，使工作上下不能及时通气，偏向与缺点不能及时克服，会使工作受到很大损失。每个工作同志，应该有勇气把工作中的真情讲出来，毫不隐藏自己工作中的缺点，不粉饰现实。只有这样，我们工作中的偏向才会及时纠正。（黎城联合办公室）
