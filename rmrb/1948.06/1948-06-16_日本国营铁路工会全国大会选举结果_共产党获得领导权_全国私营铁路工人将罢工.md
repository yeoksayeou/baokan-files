Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: At the Japanese National Railway Union National Congress held in Nara at the end of last month, the left wing achieved a decisive victory. The election results show that the union has broken away from the control of the Socialist Party and turned to the correct leadership of the Communist Party. In the newly elected Central Executive Committee, Communists and left-wing elements inclined towards the Japanese Communist Party occupy 19 seats, while the right wing of the Socialist Party and its followers hold only 15 seats. After heated competition and repeated voting between the left and right factions for the position of Chairman of the Executive Committee, a neutral person was appointed, while the Japanese Communist Party obtained the position of Vice Chairman. Regarding the demand for higher wage standards, the left wing passed a resolution for 5,100 yen per month with an overwhelming majority of 371 votes to 172 votes, while the right wing only demanded 4,400 yen per month. The Japanese National Railway Union has 540,000 members and was the only union that did not actively participate in the labor offensive in March this year and accepted the government's wage standard of 2,920 yen per month. According to Japanese officials, this union's re-election will align it with the Japanese Government Communications Workers' Union, which has 400,000 members under the influence of the Japanese Communist Party, and it is believed that the Japanese labor offensive against the Ashida Cabinet is not far away.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese workers' struggle for wage increases continues unabated. The National Congress of the All-Japan Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions passed a resolution with an overwhelming majority of 99 votes to 23, rejecting the mediation plan proposed by Iwataro Suehiro, Chairman of the Central Labor Relations Board. The following day, it resolved to launch a nationwide strike of private railway workers unless the union's demands were fully met by June 8th. The workers demanded wage increases and guarantees against layoffs during company restructuring. At the same time, six metal miners' unions under the Mitsui zaibatsu system in northern Kyushu called for 72-hour strikes on the 4th, 8th, and 9th of this month, with an estimated 8,000 participants.

Another dispatch: Statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Labor show the scale of Japanese workers' struggles to protect their vital interests in March of this year. It is said that there were 194 labor-management disputes in March, involving a total of 2,376,425 people, making it one of the months with the most disputes since the war. The total number of organized workers in Japan in May was 6,268,000, compared to only about 3 million in the autumn of 1936.

　　日本国营铁路工会全国大会选举结果
    共产党获得领导权
  　全国私营铁路工人将罢工
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：上月末在奈良召开之日本国营铁路工会全国大会，左派已赢得决定性之胜利。其选举结果显示该工会已摆脱社会党之把持，而转受共产党的正确领导。在新选出的中央执委会中，共产党员及倾向日共之左翼分子共占十九席，而社会党右派及其追随者只有十五席。执委会主席之职位经左右两派之热烈竞争与反复投票后，由一中立分子担任，而日共则获得副主席之职位。对于提高工资标准的要求，左派以三七一票对一七二票之压倒多数通过了每月五千一百日圆的决议，而右派则仅要求每月四千四百日圆。按日本国营铁路工会拥有会员五十四万人，是今年三月劳工攻势中唯一未曾积极行动，并接受政府工资标准每月二千九百二十日圆的工会。据日本官方人士表示：此一工会改选后将与另一在日共影响下拥有四十万会员的日本政府递信工会一致行动，并认为日本劳工对芦田内阁之攻势已为期不远。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：日本工人的增资斗争再接再厉。七月三十日日本私营铁路工人总同盟全国大会，以九十九票对二十三票之压倒多数通过拒绝中央劳工关系局主席末弘严太郎所提之调解方案。并于次日决议除非工会之要求在六月八日以前获得圆满答复，否则即将发动全国私营铁路工人罢工。工人要求增资及保证在公司改组时不得解雇工人。同时九州北部三井财阀系统下之六个金属矿工工会，曾号召于本月四日及八九两日先后罢工七十二小时，参加者估计有八千人。
    另讯：日本劳工省发表的统计，显示本年三月份日本劳工为维护切身利益而斗争的规模。据称：三月份内劳资纠纷已一百九十四起，参与人数共达二百三十七万六千四百二十五人，为战后纠纷最多之一月。按日本有组织之工人总数五月间已有六百二十六万八千人，但在一九三六年秋则仅为三百万人左右。
