Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th: Democratic governments in various parts of the Northeast Liberated Areas are currently vigorously leading the masses in river areas to control floods and repair embankments in order to increase the area and yield of paddy fields. The democratic governments of Hailun, Wangkui, Suihua, Tongken, and Taian counties along the Tongken and Hulan Rivers in Heilongjiang Province organized the masses to dig ditches and channel water, turning 20,000 hectares (one hectare equals ten mu) of waterlogged land into fertile fields, and it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 20,000 shi. In the first township of Yong'an District in Suihua, most of the women replaced men in farming, freeing up men to dig ditches, so that flood control and sowing were completed simultaneously. Tongken work team members personally went into the water to take the lead in digging ditches, enabling the completion of sowing on 3,000 to 4,000 hectares of waterlogged land. In 19 townships of Baixiang District in the county, more than a thousand people were drawn to dig four ditches with a total length of more than 8,600 zhang, and repaired an old trench of 5,400 zhang long and 6 zhang wide, and a dam of 3,060 zhang, exceeding the flood control plan. The masses in Sanxing District of Taian automatically donated more than 1,000 sacks, mobilized more than 1,000 workers to divert water three to four chi deep into the river, and completed sowing. At the end of April, the Andong Provincial Government led the masses to start repairing a large breach in the water storage ditch in the Dadong District of Andong. The main and branch streams of the ditch are more than 60 li long. After the breach is repaired, it can supply water to more than 70,000 mu of paddy fields. The Chahayang Dam project, the largest project in Nenjiang Province, was originally planned to be completed in three and a half months, but under the leadership of cadres and party members, it has now been completed in 70 days, increasing paddy fields by more than 20,000 hectares. In order to ensure the irrigation of more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields in the suburbs of the city, the Xiuyan County in Southern Liaoning renovated the Yanghe waterway, which is 30 li long. In the past, the Jiang bandits built trenches and bunkers on the waterway, causing the Yanghe River to silt up and resulting in historical crop failures. This spring, the democratic government completed the river renovation project with 1,700 workers. The Laohe River basin in Rehe was mostly flooded last year. This year, the Liaobei Provincial Government and the Jerim League organized county embankment repair committees, allocated grain by the government, and mobilized more than 40,000 laborers to build embankments to return the water to its old course. The embankment is more than 70 li long, half of which needs to be rebuilt or repaired. They are now working day and night to complete the project as soon as possible. After more than 40 days of effort, Qian'an County in Eastern Hebei has used 7,800 workers to largely complete the projects of clearing silt from the new river, repairing embankments, and building embankments and blocking openings in the Yihe River. More than 400 hectares of fertile fields have been opened up on both sides of the river, and seven-tenths of them have been sown. The county has also dredged five major canals, with a total length of 53 and a half li, using 20,200 workers. The government has also subsidized the construction of 24 large and small gate openings and seven bridges. Now the gates have been opened to release water, and 13,000 mu of paddy fields in the county rely on it to obtain sufficient water.

  　治水修河增加粮产
    【新华社东北十七日电】东北解放区各地民主政府刻正大力领导沿河地区群众治水修堤，以增加水田面积及产量。黑龙江省通肯河及呼兰河岸海伦、望奎、绥化、通肯、泰安等五县民主政府，曾组织群众挖沟顺水，使两万垧（一垧合十亩）涝地变成良田，预计可增产两万石食粮。绥化永安区第一乡大部妇女代替男人种地，誊出男人挖沟，使治水播种同时完成。通肯工作队员亲自下水带头挖沟，使三四千垧水涝地完成播种。该县百祥区十九个乡内抽出千余人挖成四道沟，共长八千六百余丈，并修成长五千四百丈，宽六丈的旧壕一道，及水坝三千零六十丈，超过治水计划。泰安三兴区群众自动捐出麻袋千余条，动员一千余人工将深三四尺的水导入河中，完成了播种。安东省政府于四月底领导群众动工修堵安东大东区蓄水沟大缺口，该沟本支流共长六十余里，缺口修复后可供七万余亩水田用水。嫩江省第一大工程查哈阳水坝工程，原计划三个半月完成，但在干部党员带头突击下，现已于七十天中修成，增加水田两万多垧。辽南岫岩县为保证城郊四千余亩水田之灌溉时修整长三十里的洋河水道，过去蒋匪曾在水道上修壕沟筑碉堡，使洋河淤塞，造成历史歉收，今春民主政府以一千七百个工完成了河道修整工程。热河老哈河沿河各地去年多被水淹，今年辽北省府及哲里木盟组织开了县修堤委员会，由政府拨粮，动员四十余民工修筑，使水归旧道；该堤长七十余里，一半须重修或补修，现分日夜班加工突击，即可竣工。冀东滦县经四十余天努力，用工七千八百余个，已大部完成新河清淤补堤及沂河筑堤堵口等工程，两岸辟出良田四百余顷，已有十分之七下种。该县并疏通五条大渠，共长五十三里半，用工二万零二百余个。政府又资助增修大小闸口二十四处，桥梁七座，现已开闸放水，全县一万三千亩稻田赖以获得充足水量。
