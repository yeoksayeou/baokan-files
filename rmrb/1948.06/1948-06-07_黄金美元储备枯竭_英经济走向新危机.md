Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: A United Press London dispatch reports that British financial circles are concerned that Britain is rapidly heading towards a new economic crisis. It is said that even with the aid of the Marshall Plan, it cannot bridge this gap. Britain's increasingly depleted gold and dollar reserves are dwindling to near-dangerous levels. The highly influential Manchester Guardian is deeply concerned about this deteriorating situation. On May 29th, the newspaper devoted an entire page to an editorial entitled "Approaching the Cliff," discussing this issue. Other cautionary articles have also been published in the financial sections of London newspapers. These alarmed cries have also been acknowledged by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps. Financial circles claim that the "1948 Economic Survey" published by Cripps in March is already outdated. The "Survey" estimated that Britain's merchandise trade deficit would reach £87 million in the first half of this year, while in reality, the deficit for the first four months has already reached at least £100 million. The Manchester Guardian estimates that the total deficit for the first six months of this year will reach £136 million, which is 50% more than estimated in the "Survey." Regarding Britain's consumption of gold and dollar reserves in the first half of this year, the newspaper estimates it to be £270 million, which will reduce Britain's reserves to £400 million, rather than the £450 million estimated in the "Survey." The newspaper states: "If this is the case, then relying solely on US aid and the Marshall Plan allocation, Britain will receive £330 million this year, which will not keep us out of dire straits beyond next month, and we will continue to spend heavily on gold reserves." According to material presented by the British Overseas Trade Minister Bottomley on May 7th at the Imperial Banquet, regarding Britain's overseas trade situation last year, he revealed Britain's huge trade deficit with dollar countries (United States, Argentina, Canada). It is said that in Britain's overseas trade, the United States, Canada, Argentina, and South Africa are the four major target countries. "In trade with the first three countries, we have a deficit, and they are our main sources of imports. Last year, the total value of British imports from the United States was more than six times the total value of British exports to the United States, purchases from Canada were more than five times the amount sold to that country, and purchases from Argentina were nearly four times the amount sold."

### 黄金美元储备枯竭　英经济走向新危机

　　黄金美元储备枯竭
  　英经济走向新危机
    【新华社陕北三日电】合众社伦敦讯：英国金融界人士耽心英国今日正迅速走向新的经济危机。据称，即使有马歇尔计划的援助，也不能弥补这个裂口。而英国日益枯竭的黄金与美元储备，正减少到接近危险的程度。有颇大影响的曼彻斯特卫报，十分关切此恶化中的局势。该报于五月二十九日以整版篇幅，刊载题为“快触崖了”的社论，谈论这个问题。其他警告性的文章，也刊载在伦敦各报金融栏内。这种惊慌的呼号，亦为财政大臣克利浦斯所承认。金融界人士称，克利浦斯在三月份才公布的“一九四八年经济前瞻”已经过时，“前瞻”估计英国在今年上半年，商品贸易之入超将达八千七百万镑，而实际上头四个月的入超，就至少已达一亿镑。曼彻斯特卫报估计今年头六个月的入超，总数将达一亿三千六百万镑，亦即较“前瞻”所估计的要多百分之五十。关于今年上半年英国在黄金与美元储备方面的消耗，该报估计为两亿七千万镑，这样将使英国的储备减少到四亿镑，而不是“前瞻”所估计的四亿五千万镑。该报称：假如这样，那么仅靠美国援助及马歇尔计划之分配额，英国今年得三亿三千万镑，不能使我们在下个月以后仍然处于窘境，我们仍将继续大量支用黄金储备。另据英海外贸易部长鲍特姆莱五月七日在帝国宴会席上，提出关于去年英国海外贸易情况的材料时，透露英国在与美元国家（美国、阿根廷、加拿大）贸易中的巨大入超。据称：在英国海外贸易上，美、加、阿根廷及南非为四个主要对象国，“与前三国的贸易，我们是入超的，它们是我们主要输入品的来源。去年英自美输入总值为英对美输出总值的六倍以上，自加拿大买进者为售与该国的五倍以上，自阿根廷买进者将近售出的四倍。”
