Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: The Italian working class began its struggle for wage increases in late May and has already achieved initial victories. United Press, Rome: On May 27th, 30,000 paper mill workers and staff in Cremona, Lombardy, northern Italy, initiated a strike and occupied the factories after the factory management unreasonably refused their demands. The next day, 100,000 agricultural workers in the province announced a strike. Tens of thousands of workers at tobacco plantations and cigarette factories in Lecce, southern Italy, also went on strike on the 28th, demanding higher wages. On the 31st, more than 76,000 people in Bologna went on strike. The strike by 100,000 agricultural workers in Lombardy achieved a wage increase victory on the night of the 29th.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: The political strike movement in northern Italy is expanding daily. According to United Press, Bologna, the second industrial center of Italy, announced a general strike on the 4th, protesting the arrest of four trade union leaders and the reactionary police laws prohibiting mass demonstrations. Printing workers in the Bologna area have stopped printing newspapers and banned news vendors from selling newspapers, with the exception of the Italian Communist Party's "L'Unità" newspaper. The strike for wage increases by agricultural workers in the Bologna area continues. Agricultural workers in the Cremona area, between Milan and Bologna, have also announced a strike. Landlords' livestock have not been fed, and cows have not been milked. Strike pickets have blockaded traffic. The entire area is filled with a fighting atmosphere. Fourteen agricultural workers were injured when resisting police-hired scabs who were disrupting strike order. Furthermore, strikes are brewing in Sardinia and Sicily.
