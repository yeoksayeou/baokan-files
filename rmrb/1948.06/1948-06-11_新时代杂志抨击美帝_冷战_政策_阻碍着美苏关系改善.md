Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS reports: The New Era magazine recently published an editorial entitled "The Root Cause Impeding the Peaceful Resolution of Soviet-American Differences." The editorial begins by stating: Soviet-American relations remain a focal point of widespread attention, which is not surprising, because the resolution of the current tense international situation depends on the peaceful resolution of Soviet-American differences. This is why recent statements on Soviet-American relations remain a subject of active comment and discussion by all parties. The editorial continues: The United States government, while frequently expressing its desire for peace, deliberately avoids every practical step sufficient to reach an effective agreement. The disappointment and distrust of various countries towards the reaction of American officials to Soviet statements is understandable, and even in the United States there is a belief that the "closed door" policy is not a symbol of strength but of weakness, confusion, and instability. The State Department's "May Exercises" even provoked severe criticism from newspapers acting as spokesmen for the American ruling group. Politicians who have nothing to do with the democratic aspirations of the people have had to admit that these exercises are extremely clumsy and help to expose the true nature of current American policy in the eyes of the masses. However, the important thing is not the clumsiness and mistakes of Washington's diplomacy, but the true purpose of the "Cold War" declared by American politicians against the Soviet Union, the new democracies, and all democratic forces in the world. In discussing the purpose of this "Cold War," the editorial points out: "American monopoly capitalists have profited from the tense international situation. They are turning war psychology and anti-communist frenzy into money, and they are obtaining billions of dollars in excess profits from expanding atomic blackmail and preparing for another war. People cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that China, Greece, and Palestine are already bleeding because of their selfish and short-sighted policies." The editorial concludes: The people of the whole world are unwilling to become victims of the desires of American monopolists and their European agents. Therefore, the American aggressive policy, which is the primary obstacle to lasting peace, has aroused people's disgust. Thoughtful Americans cannot fail to see that Washington's current policies are not only causing unrest among the masses, but also causing increasing suspicion. Even the ruling groups in Europe are increasingly aware that Washington's "Cold War" policy will not be beneficial to them and will have many serious consequences.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS, New York, 2nd: Twenty-two members of the American "International Economic Alliance Citizen Conference," renowned economists and jurists, recently published a letter in the New York Times, urging the improvement of trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, because "the expansion of American-Soviet trade can greatly help to ease tensions and benefit the peace that all peoples expect." The letter emphasizes: "There is no just reason why the United States and the Soviet Union should not cooperate in trade." "Let us encourage world trade and increase mutual understanding through the International Trade Organization, reciprocal trade agreements, and the abolition of discrimination and restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union and its neighbors." Signatories to the letter include Bink, Houchard, Hogate, and others, chairman of the association.

　　新时代杂志抨击美帝“冷战”政策
  　阻碍着美苏关系改善
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：新时代杂志顷发表题为“阻碍美苏分歧和平解决之症结所在”的社论。社论首称：苏美关系仍是普遍注意的焦点，这并不奇怪，因为解决目前国际关系的紧张形势，有赖于美苏分歧之和平解决，这就是为什么最近关于苏美关系的声明，仍旧是各方积极评论和讨论之题目的原因。社论继称：美国政府一方面经常表示愿望和平，但却故意避免足以达成有效协议的每一实际步骤。各国对美国官方人士对苏联声明反应的失望和不信任，是可以理解的，甚至在美国也流传着一种信念，即“关门”政策不是强大而是软弱、混乱和动荡不定的象征。国务院的“五月演习”，甚至激起那些充当美国统治集团代言人报纸的严厉批评，那些与人民民主愿望无关的政治家，也不得不承认这些演习是极端笨拙的，并且有助于在群众面前暴露美国现行政策的真正性质。但是，重要的还不在于华盛顿外交的笨拙和错误，重要的是在于美国政客们对苏联、新民主国家及全世界一切民主势力宣布的“冷战”的真正目的。在论及这种“冷战”的目的时，社论指出“美国独占资本家已经从国际关系的紧张形势中，取得了利润，他们正在把战争心理和反共狂转变为金元，他们正从扩大原子敲诈及另一次战争的准备中，获得数十亿元的超额利润。人们不能对下述事实熟视无睹，即中国、希腊和巴勒斯坦已经因为他们的自私和短视的政策而在流血。社论末称：全世界的老百姓都不愿成为美国独占家及其欧洲代理人的欲望的牺牲品，因此为持久和平之首要障碍的美国侵略政策，激起了人们的厌恶。有思想的美国人，不能不看到华盛顿的现行政策，不仅引起了群众中的不安，而且引起了日益增长的猜忌，连欧洲的统治集团也日益了解华盛顿的“冷战”政策，对他们不会有好处，而且会有很多严重的后果。
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社纽约二日讯：美“国际经济同盟公民会议”会员、著名经济学家与法学家二十二人，顷在纽约时报上发表一信，敦促改善美苏间的贸易关系，因为“美苏贸易之扩大，能够大大帮助紧张局势的缓和，并对全体人民所期望的和平有所裨益。”该信强调称：“并无正当理由，说明美苏为何不应在贸易上合作。”“让我们通过国际贸易组织互惠贸易协定，及废除对苏联与其邻国贸易上的歧视与限制，来鼓励世界贸易及增进互相间的谅解。”签名信上者有该会主席宾克、贺查德、霍加特等人。
