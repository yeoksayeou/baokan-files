　　Increasing Livestock in Taihang Through Multiple Purchases and Large-Scale Breeding
　　[Taihang News] With the support of the democratic government, the people in Taihang are extensively purchasing and breeding livestock to further improve production. Since the beginning of spring, incomplete statistics from ten counties including Xiyang, Ji County, Shouyang, Shahe, Heshun, She County, and Pingshun show that more than 1,700 head of livestock have been purchased and bred. The government's issuance of loans to assist households lacking draught animals in purchasing livestock has been most successful; Shouyang and Ji County alone purchased 324 head with loans. Six districts in Xiyang and eight villages, including Dahe in Huguan, also purchased 151 head of livestock with loans. After overcoming concerns about absolute equal distribution (i.e., absolute egalitarianism), many villagers purchased livestock in response to the demands of intensive farming for prosperity. Twenty-one villages in Xiyang, Pingshun, Heshun, and She County have reportedly purchased 242 new head. The fourth district of Changzhi has increased by 148 head. The quantity and quality of livestock in some villages has already exceeded pre-war levels. In Dongfengren Village, Xiyang, which has 138 households, livestock has increased to 148 head. County cooperative associations and state-owned stores in various counties are also paying attention to regulating livestock for the masses. The Wanxinghao and other state-owned stores in the Second District plan to purchase 1,000 head of livestock from other areas this year, and some have already been purchased. The Xiyang County Cooperative Association sent special personnel to the Jin-Sui area to exchange cloth for livestock, preparing to complete at least 100 head. Shahe, Lucheng, and other places have paid attention to breeding. Lucheng bred 345 head of livestock in half a year last year. The Shahe County government and banks issued loans for breeding livestock and stipulated that male donkeys and stallions used for breeding would not be conscripted, and pregnant donkeys and mares would be exempt from conscription for three months.

　　多方添购大量繁殖
  　太行各地牲畜增加
    【太行讯】太行各地群众在民主政府扶助下，为了把生产提高一步，大量添购与繁殖牲畜，入春以来，据昔阳、汲县、寿阳、沙河、和顺、涉县、平顺等十县不完全统计，共添购与繁殖牲口一千七百余头。政府发放贷款，扶助缺少畜力户购买牲口的成绩最大，仅寿阳、汲县两县，即以贷款买了三百廿四头。昔阳六个区及壶关大河等八村，也以贷款购卖牲口一百五十一头。许多村庄的农民们打破了绝对平分（即绝对平均主义）的思想顾虑后，在深耕细作发家致富的要求下，购买的牲畜很多，昔阳、平顺、和顺、涉县四县的廿一个村，统计已新买二百四十二头，长治四区共增加一百四十八头。有些村庄牲口的数量质量已超过战前，昔阳东丰稔村一百三十八户，牲口已增至一百四十八头。各县县联社及公营商店也注意给群众调剂牲口，二分区万兴号等公营商店计划在本年从外区购买牲口一千头。现已购回一部。昔阳县联社抽出专人到晋绥区以布换牲口，准备最少完成百头。沙河、潞城等地都注意了配种繁殖，潞城去年半年繁殖牲口三百四十五头，沙河县府及银行则发放繁殖牲口贷款，并规定配种的牡驴牡马一律不支差，怀胎的驴、马一律免差三月。
