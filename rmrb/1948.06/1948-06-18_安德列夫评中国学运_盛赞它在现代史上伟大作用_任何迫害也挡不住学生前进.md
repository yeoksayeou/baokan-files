Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Moscow Radio broadcast Andreyev's commentary on the Chinese student patriotic movement on June 6th. It highly praised the great role of the Chinese student movement in modern history and pointed out that all persecutions by the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot stop the heroic advance of the Chinese student patriotic movement. The commentary first listed the major contributions of Chinese students in the "May Fourth" Movement and the War of Resistance Against Japan, stating that Chinese young students have always been the pioneers in the struggle for their country's freedom and independence. It then pointed out that after the end of World War II, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched another civil war with the help of American imperialism, the scale of the Chinese youth and student movement in the patriotic struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace was expanding day by day. Since 1947, there have been almost constant strikes, demonstrations, and marches by male and female students. Chinese young students have suffered and are suffering from heavy oppression and great sacrifices in their heroic patriotic struggle. In addition to dealing with students by means of expulsion, arrest, and shooting, the Kuomintang reactionaries also tried to undermine the students' patriotic democratic movement from within. A large number of progressive and respected professors and teachers were dismissed on the grounds of "bad" political views and replaced by reactionary Kuomintang members. In Shanghai alone, more than 100 professors and teachers were ordered to be dismissed by the Kuomintang Ministry of Education last summer vacation. Currently, nine out of ten university presidents in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are Kuomintang members. In addition, Kuomintang secret service agencies have also sent spies to impersonate students and sabotage the patriotic movement. These secret service students carry pistols to class and use beatings and other terror tactics against ordinary students and professors; they write secret reports to assist in arrests, disrupt student demonstrations, and all work of the student union. The commentary concluded by pointing out that no matter how cruelly the Kuomintang persecutes Chinese youth, the students' patriotic struggle is still growing stronger and moving forward, and their political consciousness and understanding of their responsibility for the fate of their country are increasing day by day.

　　安德列夫评中国学运
    盛赞它在现代史上伟大作用
  　任何迫害也挡不住学生前进
    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科电台六月六日广播安得列夫对中国学生爱国运动的评论。盛赞中国学生运动在现代历史上的伟大作用。并指出国民党反动派一切迫害都阻止不了中国学生爱国运动的英勇前进。该评论首先列举中国学生在“五四”运动及抗日战争中的重大贡献，说明中国青年学生历来是为本国自由独立而奋斗的先锋。继指出在第二次世界大战结束后，当国民党反动派在美国帝国主义帮助下又发动内战的时候，中国青年学生在争取祖国独立民主和平的爱国斗争中，其运动规模日益扩大。从一九四七年起男女学生们的罢课示威与游行差不多没有间断过。中国青年学生在英勇的爱国斗争中遭受了和正在遭受着重重压迫和重大牺牲。国民党反动派除以开除、逮捕、枪杀等手段对付学生外，还从内部来破坏学生的爱国民主运动，大量的进步而受学生敬仰的教授教员在政治观点“不良”的罪名下被解聘，而代之以反动的国民党员，仅去年暑假上海一地即有教授教员百余人被国民党教育部勒令解聘，而现时国民党统治区十个大学校长中有九个是国民党员。此外国民党特务机关又派遣奸细去冒充学生，破坏爱国运动；这些特务学生带着手枪上课，用殴打和其他恐怖手段对待一般学生和教授；写秘密报告协助进行逮捕，破坏学生的示威游行和学生会的一切工作。评论最后指出：不管国民党怎样残酷的迫害中国青年，学生的爱国斗争仍日益壮大的向前发展着，他们的政治觉悟与对自己国家命运的责任的认识正在日益提高。
