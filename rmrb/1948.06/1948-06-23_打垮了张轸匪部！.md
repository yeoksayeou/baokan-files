    -- My Army at Zhang Gaozhuang Defeats Ten-Plus Attacks by Five Times the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 19th] The Zhang Gaozhuang position on the east bank of the Bai River is where the Central Plains People's Liberation Army soldiers defeated more than five times the enemy in more than ten attacks on June 2nd during the campaign to encircle and annihilate the enemy's 58th Division. After the battle, hundreds of enemy corpses, which they hadn't had time to remove, were left lying on the position. They were lying in the wheat fields, ditches, or roads almost in their original formations. Even the officers' bodies were not taken away, but were simply covered with a thin layer of soil.
    At dawn on the 2nd, in order to rescue the 58th Division surrounded by the People's Liberation Army at Maqizhuang, Zhang Zhen's bandit troops used the forces of the entire 9th Division, the entire 20th Division, and the New 10th Brigade to launch a fierce attack on the People's Liberation Army position under the cover of eight bombers, attempting to rescue the critically endangered 58th Division. The battle started in the early morning and lasted for sixteen hours. The enemy attacked more than ten times, but each time they were beaten back in a panic by our army.
    A small temple north of Zhang Gaozhuang was one of the targets the enemy wanted to seize. When the Xinhua News Agency front-line reporter entered the small temple, Yu Deshui, the deputy company commander of the 5th Company, was conducting a new combat mobilization for the soldiers. It was this company that held this small temple and repelled the enemy's attack in sixteen hours of continuous fighting. This isolated small temple has been smashed to pieces by enemy fire. The houses and walls have collapsed, all the trees have been broken, and the surrounding dozens of meters have been turned into a scorched earth. But our army's position has always stood firm.
    The 8th Company had been guarding the center of the entire position throughout the morning. At the forefront, four graves were attacked four times by the enemy. In the morning, the 5th Squad guarding the graves was forced to retreat because they had run out of ammunition. As soon as they came down, they received the order to "take it back immediately." Zhao Huaiting, the deputy platoon commander of the 3rd Platoon, immediately picked up his machine gun and led two squads to charge back in two directions, and recaptured the grave mounds. After a while, a regiment of Jiang bandit's entire 9th Division rushed up in three directions. Just as they reached a dozen meters from the grave mounds, Zhao Huaiting, carrying his machine gun, led the soldiers, charging and firing, firing more than twenty bursts of bullets. After an enemy commander carrying a red flag was shot down, all the enemies were driven back. For the third charge, the enemy changed to the entire 20th Division. Mountain guns, chemical mortars, and eight bombers all fired together. The enemy took advantage of the smoke and fire from the artillery and swarmed in. At this time, only four soldiers were left guarding the grave mounds in the 8th Squad. The grave mounds were taken by the enemy again. Zhao Huaiting was both angry and anxious, and immediately led seven or eight soldiers with bayonets to charge forward. The enemy was setting up a machine gun on the grave. As soon as one person showed his head, he was shot down by soldier Wang Xiaode. The second enemy showed half of his head, and Wang Xiaode fired another shot, and the enemy fell to the ground. The third enemy had just set up his machine gun on the grave when Zhao Huaiting jumped up two steps, pulled out a grenade, and hit the enemy in the chest. The position was regained.
    In the afternoon, the 6th Company took over the position, and the enemy changed to the New 10th Brigade and began the fourth general attack. Squad Leader Long Baoshan and three soldiers guarded the grave. When Long Baoshan squatted down to avoid the artillery fire, an enemy machine gunner had already rushed up. Long Baoshan looked up and saw that the enemy's machine gun was right above his head. He picked up a bomb and threw it over, killing the enemy and seizing the machine gun. He then threw two more grenades, killing all the enemies who had rushed up. When it got dark, the enemy, having suffered heavy losses and leaving a large number of corpses on the position, fled west in the night.
  　 Xiaocao阻击战(Zǔjīzhàn)
    -- Crushing the Bandit's Attempt to Flee South for Reinforcements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st] Late on the night of June 1st, the 3rd Battalion of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to hold the Xiaocao position. Xiaocao is close to the Wuyang-Luohe Highway and is a central and prominent position on the more than twenty-mile-long阻击(zǔjī) line. The soldiers of the 3rd Battalion had been fighting on the front lines for two days. When they received the order to continue to阻击(zǔjī) the enemy, all the commanders and fighters of the battalion immediately became nervous and rushed to repair fortifications and bunkers and clear obstacles to firing overnight. The soldiers encouraged each other and said, "We will resolutely阻击(zǔjī) the enemy here and not allow them to pass through to ensure that our brother troops win the battle." At 2:00 p.m. the next day, the Jiang bandit's 18th Army concentrated the artillery fire of two brigades to bombard our army. Countless large and small shells exploded on the Xiaocao position. The sky over Xiaocao was shrouded in a cloud of thick smoke and fire. The soldiers guarding the walls immediately and skillfully lay down in the fortifications when they heard the enemy's shells fired from the artillery, but as soon as the artillery fire stopped, they jumped up from the thick smoke and fire, picked up their weapons and monitored the enemy.
    More than a company of the enemy's forces began to attack the outer positions southeast of Xiaocao. The 3rd Platoon of the "Xuchang Company" was guarding this position. Although many enemy shells fell around their position, the soldiers guarded there like iron men. When groups of enemies approached, the soldiers' machine guns caused the enemies to retreat in a panic.
    The second round of artillery fire began to roar again. The enemy dispatched more than a dozen tanks, rushing in two directions. Armored vehicles closely followed the tanks. Infantrymen jumped out of the vehicles and charged towards our army's position. The People's Liberation Army soldiers bravely fought back, concentrating light and heavy machine guns,冲防枪(chōng fáng qiāng), 60 mortars...raining down on the enemy's tanks and infantry. The tanks, like clumsy pigs, turned their heads and fired artillery at our army's position, and roared from the flanks and rear of our position.
    The soldiers of the "Xuchang Company" guarding in the trenches suddenly jumped up and, led by combat hero instructor Li Hua, blocked the path of the tanks. When the tanks approached within twenty meters, a row of grenades were thrown, and the leading tank plunged into the ditch like a drunken man. The muzzle of the gun on the tank was stuck in the mud. The driver in the tank raised a white flag asking for help. The second and third tanks immediately sped over to respond. Li Hua, holding a Canadian-style gun, nimbly climbed onto the tank and fired into the observation hole. As a result, another tank could no longer move.
    After twenty-six hours of combat, the 3rd Battalion resisted the Jiang bandit army's frantic attacks with tanks and artillery, destroying and damaging three enemy tanks, and hundreds of enemy corpses were lying in front of the position, crushing the enemy's 18th Army's attempt to break through and flee south for reinforcements. The 3rd Battalion of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army heroically completed the glorious task of defending Xiaocao.
    Delivering Tea, Reporting News
  　 The People of Western Henan Love Our Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st] At the beginning of this month, when the People's Liberation Army pursued Zhang Zhen's bandit troops fleeing to Nanyang during the Wan East Campaign, the common people along the way delivered tea and water and denounced the crimes of the Jiang bandit army. In Qiaotou Town, east of Nanyang, an old man with white hair carried a pot of water to pour boiling water for the passing soldiers, and encouraged the soldiers: "Chase them quickly! Those turtles (referring to the Jiang bandit army) haven't run far yet." Old Man Shen, who runs a restaurant in the town, braved the scorching sun to boil water for the soldiers. He also said in a very apologetic tone: "If my noodles hadn't been snatched away by those turtles, I would definitely make noodles for you to eat." When another People's Liberation Army unit pursued the enemy through Yindian, an eighty-two-year-old woman specially cooked three eggs for the People's Liberation Army, murmuring: "The benefactors have come." The common people who had fled from the villages occupied by the Jiang bandit army reported the news to the People's Liberation Army one after another: "Chase them quickly, the dog days haven't escaped across the Bai River." In all the villages occupied by the Jiang bandit army, chicken feathers and pig bristles were everywhere, and the common people were full of resentment. The Jiang bandit army only stayed in Qiaotou Town for one night, and as many as thirty pigs were snatched and killed on South Street alone, and more than half of the able-bodied men and carts in the town were taken away. The female owner of a grocery store pointed to the empty snack boxes and emptied wine jars that had been looted, and said angrily: the loss of her family alone was worth more than 23 million Jiang coins. The Jiang bandit army took black beans worth 240,000 Jiang coins from another family, and only gave 5,000 yuan in exchange. The common people refused to accept the money, and the bandits shamelessly said: "It's not that we don't give money, it's that you don't want it."

　　打垮了张轸匪部！
　　宛东阻击战一角
    ——张高庄我军打垮五倍敌人十几次进攻
    【新华社中原前线十九日电】白河东岸的张高庄阵地，是中原解放军战士们于围歼敌五十八师的战役中，六月二日打垮了五倍以上敌人十几次进攻的地方。战斗结束后，阵地上还横陈着敌人未及抬走的几百具死尸。他们几乎是照着原来的队形躺在麦地里、水沟里、或道路上。甚至连军官的尸体也顾不上运走，只是身上掩着一层薄土。
    二日拂晓，张轸匪部为解救被解放军包围在马凄庄的五十八师，乃以整九师、整二十师和新十旅的兵力，在八架轰炸机掩护下猛烈进攻解放军阵地，想把垂危的五十八师救出重围。战斗从清晨开始，持续了十六个小时，敌人进攻了十几次，但每一次都被我军打得狼狈而回。
    张高庄以北的一座小庙，是敌人所要争夺的目标之一。当新华社前线记者走进小庙时，五连副连长于德水正在向战士们进行新的战斗动员。正是这个连持续了十六小时的战斗，守住了这座小庙，打退了敌人的进攻。这座孤立的小庙，已被敌人的炮火打得稀烂，房子和墙都打塌了，所有的树木被打断了，周围几十公尺被打成了一片焦土。但我军的阵地却始终在屹立着。
    第八连在整个上午曾守卫在整个阵地的中央。在最前沿有四座坟堆被敌人连攻了四次。早晨，守坟堆的第五班，因为打完了弹药，被迫撤了下来。刚下来就得到了“马上夺回来”的命令。三排副赵怀廷立即端起机枪，带着两个班分两路冲杀回去，又把坟包夺了回来。一会，蒋匪整九师一个团的兵力分成三路又冲上来，刚进到达坟包十几公尺的地方，赵怀廷又端着机枪带着战士，一面冲一面打，一直打了二十多梭子弹，当一个拿红旗子的敌人指挥官被打倒后，全部敌人被打退了。第三次冲锋，敌人换来了整二十师。山炮、化学炮，还有八架轰炸机，各种火力一齐打来。敌人趁着炮火烟雾，蜂拥而来。这时守坟包的第八班，只剩下四个战士，坟包又被敌人夺去了。赵怀廷又气又急，立即带了七八个战士挺着刺刀猛冲过去。敌人正在坟头上架机枪，一个人刚露头，就被战士王孝德一枪打翻了。第二个敌人露出半个头，王孝德又是一枪，敌人应声倒地。第三个敌人把机枪刚架在坟堆上，赵怀廷两步跳上去扒出颗手榴弹，打中敌人胸口。阵地又重被夺回来。
    下午，六连接替了阵地，敌人又换成了新十旅，又开始了第四次总攻。九班长龙宝山和三个战士守卫坟头，当龙宝山蹲下身去躲避炮火时，一个敌人机枪手已冲上来，龙宝山抬头一看，敌人的机枪正架在他的头顶上。他拿起一颗炸弹投过去，把敌人打死了，夺过来机枪。接连又投了两颗手榴弹，把冲上来的敌人都打死了。天黑时敌人因损失惨重，阵地上遗失了大批尸体，乘夜全部向西逃窜了。
  　小曹阻击战
    ——粉碎匪南窜增援企图
    【新华社中原前线二十一日电】六月一日深夜，解放军某团三营，奉命坚守小曹阵地。小曹紧靠着舞阳漯河公路，在长达二十余里的阻击线上是一个中心和突出的阵地。三营的战士们，已经在火线上战斗了两天，当他们接到继续阻击敌人的命令，全营指战员立即紧张起来，连夜抢修工事地堡、扫清射击障碍。战士们相互鼓舞的说：“咱们在这里坚决阻击敌人，不允许敌人通过，来保证咱们的兄弟部队打胜仗。”第二天下午二时，蒋匪十八军集中两个旅的炮火，向我军轰击，无数的大小炮弹在小曹阵地上爆炸；小曹的天空，被一片浓烟烈火所笼罩。坚守在围墙上的战士们，一听到敌人的炮弹射出炮口，立即机敏的卧在工事里，但当炮火一停，他们就从浓烟烈火中跳起来，端起武器监视着敌人。
    敌人一个多连的兵力开始向小曹东南的外围阵地进攻。“许昌连”第三排守卫在这块阵地上；虽然敌人许多炮弹落在他们阵地的周围，战士们却象铁人一样的守卫在那里。待成群的敌人接近时，战士们的机枪，打得敌人连滚带爬的溃退回去。
    第二阵炮火又开始轰鸣，敌人出动十几辆坦克，分两路冲来，坦克的后面紧随着装甲汽车，步兵从汽车上跳下来，向我军阵地冲锋。解放军战士们奋勇迎击，集中了轻重机枪、冲防枪、六○炮……雨点一样的向敌人的坦克、步兵打去，坦克却象笨猪一样的掉转头向我军阵地开炮轰击，并且嚎叫着从我阵地侧后驰来。
    守候在壕沟里的“许昌连”的战士们突然跳起来，在战斗英雄指导员李华的率领下，挡住了坦克的去路。当坦克驰近二十米达处，一排手榴弹摔去，为首的一辆坦克象喝醉了酒一样，一头扎进沟里去。车上的炮口插进泥土里。坦克里的驾驶员摇起了求救的白旗，第二和第三辆坦克，立即飞驶过来接应，李华拿着加拿大式枪敏捷的爬上坦克，从了望孔里打进去，于是又一辆坦克便再也不能动了。
    经过二十六小时的战斗，三营阻挡住了蒋匪军的坦克大炮的疯狂进攻，毁伤了敌人三辆坦克，成百的敌尸横陈在阵地前，粉碎了敌十八军夺路南窜增援的企图。解放军某团三营，英勇的完成了守备小曹的光荣任务。
    送茶水、报消息
  　豫西人民热爱我军
    【新华社中原前综二十一日电】本月初宛东战役解放军追击向南阳逃窜的张轸匪部时，沿途老百姓纷纷送茶水，并控诉蒋匪军罪行。在南阳以东桥头镇，一个白发的老汉，提着一壶水给经过的战士倒开水，并鼓励战士们：“快追呀！龟孙们（指蒋匪军）跑的还不远。”该镇一个开饭铺的沈老汉，冒着炎日给战士们烧水，他还带着很抱歉的口气说：“要不是我的面让龟孙们抢光了，我一定给你们做面条吃。”另部解放军追击敌人经过尹店，有位八十二岁的老太太特地给解放军煮了三颗鸡蛋，口中喃喃的说：“恩人来了。”从蒋匪军所占领的村庄逃来的老百姓则纷纷向解放军报告消息：“快追，狗日的还没有逃过白河。”凡蒋匪军占领过的村庄，鸡毛猪毛遍地，老百姓一片怨恨声。蒋匪军在桥头镇只住了一夜，光是南街就有三十多头猪被抢去杀了，全镇一半以上的青壮年和大车均被拉走。一家杂货铺的女主人指着抢光了的空点心盒子，倒空了的酒缸，气愤的说：光她一家的损失就值蒋币两千三百多万。蒋匪军在另一家把价值二十四万元蒋币的黑豆拿去，只给五千元代价，老百姓拒绝收钱，匪徒们竟无耻的说：“这可不是我们不给钱，是你们不要。”
