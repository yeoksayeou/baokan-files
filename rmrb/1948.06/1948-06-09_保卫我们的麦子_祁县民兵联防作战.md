Defend Our Wheat
　　Qixian Militia Joint Defense Operations
The militia of the Second District of Qixian County, under the slogan of defending the sowing and defending the wheat harvest, carried out joint defense operations. On the 19th of last month, the puppet self-defense force of Sangyan Township, in coordination with the enemy's 44th Division, led more than 200 fleeing landlords to Changshan, Jiabei, Dazhuang, and other villages, seized livestock and destroyed farm tools. Hao Sheng, the Armed Forces Committee member, and Yang Wenliang, the political director of Niujiazhuang, along with fourteen militiamen, rushed towards the enemy's position. Villagers' militia from Niujiazhuang, Duanjiaping, and Beijian'an also ran over with guns, approaching the enemy within 40 meters. A volley of grenades and a burst of killing sounds threw the enemy into chaos. They ran away without firing a shot, abandoning the clothes, livestock, bedding, rice, flour, and farm tools they had looted along the way, even the foreign cloth bundles and iron bars they had used to seize grain. Three enemies were killed or wounded, while we suffered no losses.
　　At dawn the next day, the 3rd platoon of the 2nd battalion of the 1st regiment of the enemy's 37th Division sneaked into the northern and southern villages of Er'ai in an attempt to retaliate against our joint defense militia and backbone team. Having obtained intelligence, we quickly withdrew the militia to the mountain top, covered the masses' retreat to Yuejiagou, drove the enemy back to Baituling, and recovered 26 donkeys. While the enemy was fleeing, they triggered one of our wooden mine, killing and wounding two.
　　On May 1st, a part of the Nantuanbai enemy, in coordination with the Lucun self-defense force of more than 50 people, launched a three-pronged attack on Yukou. Our joint defense militia ambushed on the eastern mountain of Yukou. When the enemy approached the ambush circle, our militia fired a volley of shots, causing the enemy to run around in chaos. Four were killed or wounded, and they fled back to their lair in disgrace.

　　保卫我们的麦子
  　祁县民兵联防作战
    祁县二区民兵，在保卫下种保卫麦收口号下进行联防作战，上月十九日桑岩乡伪自卫队，配合敌四十四师带领逃亡地主共计二百余人，到我常山、贾贝、大庄等村，拉牲口破坏农具，武委会郝胜及牛家庄政治主任杨文亮相伴十四个民兵向敌阵地扑去，我牛家庄、段家坪、北建安等村民兵亦持枪跑来，摸至敌四十余米达时，我一排手榴弹一阵杀声，敌张惶混乱，一枪未发直跑，抢去的衣服、牲口、被褥、米面、农具都扔在中途，甚至把它抢粮的洋布包、铁杠子都扔了，毙伤敌三名，我方毫无损失。
    第二天拂晓，敌三十七师一团二营三排摸到了儿崖南北庄企图报复我联防民兵及基干队，我得情报迅速把民兵撤至山头，掩护群众退到岳家沟，把敌赶回白土岭，并夺回毛驴二十六头，敌溃逃时踏响我木板雷一颗，炸死炸伤两名。
    五月一日，南团柏敌人一部配合鲁村自卫队五十余人，分三路进攻我峪口，我联防民兵，埋伏峪口东山上待敌接近埋伏圈时，我民兵一阵排枪，敌到处乱跑，被毙伤四名，狼狈窜回老窝。
