[Jizhong News] Hejian's industry and commerce are flourishing under the support of the democratic government. It has now increased more than four times compared to before liberation. When the city was liberated by us in May 1945, there were only 71 stationary merchants. After liberation, by December 1947, this had increased to 279. The number of pharmaceutical factories and leather industries alone increased from two to 71. However, during the land reform, errors of infringing upon industry and commerce occurred, and the mood of industrial and commercial households was unstable at that time, which affected the development of industry and commerce.

After the county discovered these phenomena, it quickly corrected them. First, it persuaded the poor peasant associations to release the detained households and remove the seals from the sealed doors. It also convened a merchants' conference to deeply explain the Party's policy of resolutely protecting industry and commerce, as well as the specific instructions of the Jizhong Administrative Office on protecting industry and commerce. It successively returned the photography equipment and furniture of Hongxing Photo Studio, the shares of Yishoutang, the furniture of Hongsheng Store, and the parts of Kuihang Cart Shop. This eliminated the doubts of industrial and commercial households and stabilized their mood. For example, Jin Sijie, the manager of Sanyou Shoe Store, had his home struggled against by the masses, and nine bolts of small cloth and a paper machine stored at home were also confiscated. Jin Sijie became extremely worried and stopped the shoe store's business. Later, after explanation and the return of the small cloth and other items, the shoe store immediately resumed work.

The industrial and commercial tax was rectified. Due to the lack of thorough investigation and understanding in the second and third quarters of last year's industrial and commercial tax collection, only one or two households in each industry were understood as typical standard households. The tax was determined based on the size of the business and who was doing the most business, which was not truly fair and reasonable, and some industrial and commercial households were dissatisfied. When collecting taxes in February this year, the previous erroneous collection methods were corrected. Collection was carried out according to the principle of levying taxes on net profits, with a maximum of no more than 25 percent. For example, Sun Ruda of Dianhuo Shop actually earned 3 million, but reported 4.5 million. Ruiyixing Vinegar and Sauce Garden actually earned 4.2 million, but reported 6 million. After the leadership discovered this situation, they learned about the reasons for the overreporting through informal discussions. Some said, "I am an old business, I am afraid that if I report less, the government will say that I am not telling the truth, so I added a little." At the same time, the outstanding taxes of households with excessive tax burdens last year were reviewed by the representatives of industrial and commercial households, who put forward opinions on tax reduction and exemption. After government review, a total of 23.800674 million yuan in taxes were reduced or exempted for 112 households in the city.

When the bandit Fu invaded Hejian on April 15 this year, 26 industrial and commercial households in the city were burned down, burning a total of 113 houses, with losses estimated at around 150 million. The merchants' morale was somewhat low for a time. In order to help merchants resume business, the democratic government issued low-interest long-term loans of 16.2 million yuan from the bank, and lent 27,300 bricks. Now the houses of all the burned industrial and commercial households have been completely repaired. Yongxincheng Restaurant, Darentang Pharmacy, Fufengxiang Grocery Store, and others have already opened, and the remaining few will also resume business around the 20th. On the first day of Fufengxiang's reopening, it sold 14.165 million yuan of goods. The mass-produced soap factory sold more than 6 million yuan of goods, and Xincheng Restaurant sold more than 1.3 million yuan of goods. Under the influence of our in-depth implementation and concrete solutions to practical problems, the concerns of ordinary merchants have been broken. In the three months after the land reform, 58 new households were added in 15 industries, including cart shops, barber shops, button making, textile, and shoe factories. In total, there are now 312 households in 33 industries in the city, including shoe industry, restaurants, military uniform shops, butcher shops, cart shops, watch shops, textile, iron industry, and oil and vinegar shops. The market is more active, and the area of ​​goods exchange has expanded. Merchants from Southern Hebei, Taihang, and Shandong all come here to purchase. Now industrial and commercial households are working hard to actively build a prosperous Hejian city.

### 河间工商业日益发达　增加工商户四倍多

　　河间工商业日益发达
  　增加工商户四倍多
    【冀中讯】河间工商业，在民主政府扶植下，日益发达。现已较解放前增加四倍多。该市在民国三十四年五月为我解放时，只有坐商七十一户，解放后，至民国三十六年十二月间，即增到二百七十九户，仅药厂、皮革业即由两户发展到七十一户。但在土地改革时，曾一度发生侵犯工商业的错误，当时各工商户情绪不稳，使工商业的发展受到影响。
    该县发觉这些现象以后，即抓紧纠正。首先说服贫农团将扣押户释放了，封门的揭了封。并召开商人大会，深入讲解我党坚决保护工商业的政策及冀中行署保护工商业的具体指示，并先后把鸿兴照像馆的照像器材家具，益寿堂的股金，鸿升店的家具，魁行车子铺的零件等，都退了回去，这样，消除了工商户的怀疑，稳定了情绪。如三友鞋店经理金思杰，他家里被群众斗争了，把鞋店存在家中的小布九匹夹纸一部，也被没收了，金思杰引起极大顾虑，停止了鞋店的商业，后来经过解释，并把小布等如数退回后，鞋店即马上复工。
    在工商税方面，进行了整顿。去年二、三季工商征收，由于事前调查了解不深入，每行仅了解一二户为典型标准户，就根据买卖大小，谁家做的热闹来定，没有做到真正公平合理，有些工商户发生不满。今年二月征收时，改正过去错误征收办法。按纯利征收，最多不超过百分之二十五的原则进行征收。如店货铺孙汝达，实际上得利三百万，却报了四百五十万元。瑞义兴醋酱园，实际得利四百二十万，报了六百万元。领导上发觉这种情况后。经过漫谈了解多报的原因，有的说：“我是老买卖，怕报少了政府说我不说实话，就添点呗”。同时将去年税收过重户的尾欠，经过工商户各行代表会评议，提出减免意见，经政府审核，全市共减免一百十二户的税款二千三百八十万零六千七百四十元。
    今年傅匪于四月十五日窜扰河间时，全市二十六家工商户被烧毁，共烧房子一百十三间，损失约在十五万万左右，商人情绪一时有些低落。民主政府为帮助商人复业，由银行发放低利长期贷款一千六百二十万元，贷砖二万七千三百个，现各被烧毁的工商户的房子已全部修好。永信成饭庄、大仁堂药铺、佛丰祥杂货铺等已经开业，其余几家亦将二十日前后复业。佛丰祥复业后第一天即卖了一千四百一十六万五千元的货，群众造胰厂卖货六百多万元，信成饭庄卖货一百三十多万元。在我深入贯彻与具体解决实际问题的影响下，打破了一般商人的顾虑。土改后三个月，新增车子铺，理发、制扣、纺织、鞋工厂等十五行业共五十八户。总计全市已有鞋业、饭铺、军衣庄、肉铺、车子铺、钟表铺、纺织、铁业、油醋铺等三十三种行业三百一十二户，市场较前活跃，货物交流地区扩大，冀南、太行、山东的商人均来这里采购。现在工商户，正为积极建设繁荣的河间市而努力。
