Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: With the clear policies and support of the democratic government, private industrial and commercial enterprises in Jilin City have rapidly resumed operations. Out of the city's original 3,600+ factories, workshops, and stores, 3,265 had resumed operations within just one month after liberation. The city was originally one of the industrial cities in the Northeast. During the Japanese puppet regime, there were 58 large factories alone (including heavy industry, letterpress printing, textiles, and over ten other types), employing over 20,000 workers. Including the workers in Xiaofengman and small to medium-sized factories in the city, along with all of their family members, the total number of people was approximately 80,000 to 90,000, accounting for over one-third of the city's population (250,000). When the Japanese invaders were defeated on August 15, 1945, most of the factories were destroyed. Under the rule of the Chiang bandits, they were further devastated, with most of the materials dismantled and used to build city defense works. Equipment from electrical, chemical, and artificial soybean oil factories was sold off in large quantities, leading to the near-complete shutdown of factories. Commerce was extremely depressed due to the manipulation and monopoly of bureaucratic capital, and the looting during the retreat of the Chiang army. After the democratic government entered the city, through one month of effort, 92% of the city's industrial and commercial enterprises resumed operations one after another, and the market gradually showed signs of prosperity. The reason for this was primarily the democratic municipal government's firm implementation of the policy of protecting industry and commerce. When the Chiang bandits fled, some citizens took the opportunity to seize the property of some industrial and commercial households. After the democratic government entered the city, it immediately issued a proclamation protecting industry and commerce, prohibiting farmers from spontaneously entering the city to settle accounts with landlords and industrial and commercial enterprises, and ordering a halt to any destruction of industry and commerce. Following this, the citywide industrial and commercial conference, industrial and commercial symposium, and industrial and commercial representatives' conference were convened. Government officials personally participated and presided over these meetings, clearly announcing the policy of protecting all legal industrial and commercial enterprises and supporting the development of all industrial and commercial enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy. On the one hand, capitalists deeply resented the manipulation and monopoly of bureaucratic capital by the Chiang bandits, which devastated private capital. On the other hand, they still held doubts about the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. They raised questions such as whether industry and commerce would be protected in the long term, whether all industries would be protected equally, whether it would be permissible to hire shop assistants and workers, what the wage and tax policies would be, and whether free trade would be allowed. After repeated explanations and answers from government officials, their doubts gradually disappeared. At the same time, the government also distributed 100 million yuan in relief funds to the citizens to alleviate food shortages, and established grain retail stores, selling grain at low prices. Business loans of 300 million yuan were issued to ironworkers, shoemakers, and the textile industry. The government also announced the abolition of the Chiang government's exorbitant taxes and levies, and exempted business tax for half a year. This series of proactive measures dispelled the concerns of industrialists and businessmen, and various industries in the city successively opened for business. The owner of a sugar mill in Chaoyang District said, "I have been watching for a month, and now I truly believe in the policy of protecting industry and commerce." In ten days, 45 new factories and household handicraft industries were opened in the district.

　　吉林市在民主政府扶助下
    三千多家工厂复业
  　商店全部开门市面已呈繁荣
    【新华社东北三日电】吉林市私营工商业，在民主政府的明确政策与扶植下，已迅速恢复营业。全市原有三千六百余家工厂作坊和商店，解放后仅一个月，即有三千二百六十五家恢复营业。该市原为东北工业城市之一，伪满时仅大工厂即达五十八家（包括重工业、铅印、纺织等十余种），据有工人两万余，连同小丰满及市内中小工厂工人及全体工人家属，共约八九万人，占全市人口（二十五万）三分之一强。一九四五年八月十五日日寇败退时，工厂大部被破坏，蒋匪统治时又加摧残，拆毁大部材料拿去修筑城防工事，并将电气、化学、人造豆油等工厂器材大批出卖，致工厂几全部停工。商业则在官僚资本操纵垄断，及蒋军撤退时抢劫下，极为凋蔽。民主政府入城后，经一个月之努力，全市百分之九十二的工商业纷纷复业，市面渐呈繁荣气象，其原因首先在于民主市政府坚决执行保护工商业的政策。当蒋匪撤逃后，某些市民曾乘隙抢了一些工商业户的财产，民主政府入城后，立即颁发保护工商业布告，禁止农民自发地入城清算地主和工商业，并下令制止任何破坏工商业，接着召开全市工商界大会、工商业座谈会及工商界代表会等，政府负责人亲自参加主持，明确宣布保护一切合法工商业的政策，并扶助一切有利于国民经济的工商业的发展。资本家们一方面痛恨蒋匪官僚资本操纵垄断，摧残私人资本；另方面，对民主政府工商业政策仍抱怀疑态度。他们提出是否长期保护工商业，各行各业是否一律保护，是否允许雇用店员和工人，工资与税收政策如何，是否可以自由贸易等问题，经政府负责人反复说明解答，他们的疑虑乃渐渐消除。同时，政府并发放市民救济款一万万元调剂民食，并设立粮食小卖店，贱价抛售粮食。对铁工、鞋业、纺织业等发放营业贷款三万万元。政府又宣布废除蒋政府的苛捐杂税，并豁免半年营业税等。这一连串的积极措施，使工商业者的顾虑消失，市内各业相继开门营业。朝阳区一家糖坊掌柜说：“我已观望了一个月，这回才真正相信保护工商业政策”。该区在十天中新开业的工厂及家庭手工业等，即达四十五家。
