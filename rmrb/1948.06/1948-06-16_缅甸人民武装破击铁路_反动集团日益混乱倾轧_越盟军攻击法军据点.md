    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to Rangoon news from the Associated Press and other sources: The activities of the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party are becoming increasingly strengthened. The main artery of the civil war, on which the reactionary government relies—the railway from Rangoon to Mandalay—has been paralyzed under the blows of the people's armed forces, and several sections have even been destroyed. A freight train between Pyinmana and Wataw was burned by the local people's armed forces on the 5th. More than 500 people's armed forces attacked a police patrol, killing several people including the police chief. As the activities of these people's armed forces "spread like wildfire in Burma" (Associated Press), the chaos and infighting within the ruling reactionary group are intensifying. Within the Freedom League, a movement led by Ba Maw, leader of the Civilian Party (who served as the puppet prime minister during the Japanese occupation of Burma during the war), is being launched to seize power from Thakin Nu.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to a Saigon dispatch from Agence France-Presse: French military authorities announced on the 9th a weekly military bulletin, admitting that "military activities" throughout Vietnam were quite tense. It is said that the fighting in the Tonkin region of northern Vietnam is particularly fierce. In the My Tho area of Cochinchina in southern Vietnam, a battalion of Viet Minh forces attacked a French stronghold on the evening of the 2nd, causing the French army to dispatch a large number of infantry, artillery, armored forces, and air force to respond. Among the French officers and soldiers killed in action was an artillery platoon leader.

  　越盟军攻击法军据点
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据合众社等仰光消息透露：缅共领导的人民武装的活动日趋加强。反动政府所依恃的内战大动脉——仰光至曼德勒的铁道，在人民武装打击下已陷麻痹，其中数段且已被折毁。平蛮与瓦涛间的货车于五日被当地人民武装焚毁。人民武装五百余人袭击警察巡逻队，毙警长以下数人。在这人民武装活动“燎原于缅甸”（合众社语）之际，执政的反动集团内部之混乱和倾轧日甚。自由同盟内部以平民党领袖巴茂（战时日寇占缅期间，曾任伪总理）为首，正发动运动与德钦努抢夺政权。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据法新社西贡讯：法国军事当局九日发表的一周军事公报，承认越南全境之“军事活动”颇为紧张。据称：越南北部东京区的战事特别激烈。在越南南部交趾支那的美沙地区，越盟军一营曾于二日晚，攻击一法军据点，使法军出动大批步兵、炮兵、装甲部队及空军应战，法军阵亡官兵中有炮兵排长一名。
