　　Workers and Factory Management in a Czech Public Factory
　　Liu Ningyi

　　In Czechoslovakia, staff and workers participate in the same trade union, with the aim of unifying the workforce and intensifying production. The organizational structure for production and management within their factories, under the leadership of the manager, has a Factory Committee as the highest authority within the factory. It is composed of representatives from three other committees: The first is the Production Committee, which, under the leadership of the heads of each production department, is composed of representatives elected by all employees, including technical workers and model workers. It specializes in studying and considering how to allocate manpower and materials, coordinate with national production plans, encourage labor enthusiasm, improve production efficiency, improve quality, and reduce costs. The second is the Workers' Committee, which, under the leadership of the trade union, is composed of representatives elected by all employees. Its main purpose is to oversee the implementation of worker welfare, conduct cultural and technical education, check whether workers are working hard for the production plan, and examine factory insurance conditions, and review whether the Administrative Committee's increase or decrease in workers is reasonable, and whether the dismissal or addition of individual workers is appropriate. The third is the Administrative Committee, composed of the management appointed by the government. Its main purpose is to formulate the factory's production plan in line with the production plan of the government's Ministry of Industry and to carry out the overall administrative management of the factory. The representatives of the above three parties form the Factory Committee, which is the highest authority in the factory. The resolutions it makes are absolutely executed by all three parties. It meets every two weeks, chaired by the manager, with the Administrative Committee as the main body, absorbing the participation of the other two parties in the discussion. The national wage standard for workers is determined by the Ministry of Industry according to grades, with differences based on work ability and skill; it is proposed by the Production Committee, formulated by the Administrative Committee, agreed upon by the Workers' Committee, and then implemented by the administrative side. As for the overall wage standard, it cannot be decided by individual factories; it must be adjusted by the Ministry of Industry as a whole. An individual worker's wage increase must be based on his own technical improvement or new creation in order to obtain a higher grade or bonus. If production is not diligently pursued, after the suggestion of the Production Committee and the deliberation of the Workers' Committee, the Administrative Committee will execute the demotion.
　　The trade union must not represent the work of any committee; its task is to organize, lead, and educate employees so that the above-mentioned Workers' and Production Committees can be perfectly promoted to complete their tasks. The management department is appointed by the government and represents the government in managing all daily administration of the factory. It also concentrates the democratic opinions of the workers, so it is a centralized executive organ. At regular meetings, there is also a high degree of democracy.
　　If workers and staff members are proficient in their work and have the talent to manage factories, they can be recommended by the workers and submitted to the government, which will select and send them to the factories in need as managers.

　　捷克公营工厂的工人与厂方
    刘宁一
    捷克的职员和工人，都参加同一的工会，目的是职工统一加紧生产。他们厂内生产与管理的组织机构，在经理领导之下，有一个工厂委员会为本厂最高权力机关，它由另外三个委员会的代表组成：其一是生产委员会，在本厂各生产部门主任领导之下，由全体职工选举技术工人与劳模分子为代表，组成专门研究考虑如何配置人力物力，和配合全国生产计划，鼓励劳动热诚，提高生产效率，提高质量，减低成本。其二是工人委员会，在工会领导之下，由全体职工选举代表组成之。主要是照顾工人福利的实施，进行文化技术教育，检查工人是否为生产计划而努力，和工厂保险的条件，审议行政委员会的增减工人是否合理，个别具体工人的被裁减或添用是否恰当。其三是行政委员会，由政府指派的经理部组成。主要是配合政府工业部生产计划作出本厂生产计划，和全厂的行政管理。以上三方面代表，合组为工厂委员会，为本厂最高权力机关。它作出的决议，三方面绝对执行。每两星期开会一次，由经理任主席，以行政委员会为主体，吸收其他二者参加讨论。全国工人工资标准，由工业部规定等级，依工作能力与技术而分其差别；由生产委员会提出，行政委员会制订，经工人委员会同意，再由行政方面执行。至于整个工资标准，则不能由个别工厂作决定，必须由工业部全盘调整。工人个人工资的提高，必须他自己在技术上提高或有新的创造，才可以获得较高的等级或奖金。如果生产不努力，经过生产委员会建议，工人委员会审议，交行政委员会执行降级。
    工会不得代表任何一个委员会的工作，它的任务是组织领导和教育职工，使上述工人及生产两委员会得到完满的推动他们完成任务。经理部是政府派的，代表政府管理工厂的一切日常行政，它又集中了工人的民主意见，所以他是集中执行的机关。在定期会议上，又有高度的民主。
    工人和职员中，如有精通业务，并有管理工厂的才能者，可经工人推举，提请政府，由政府选用派到所需要的工厂作为经理人员。
