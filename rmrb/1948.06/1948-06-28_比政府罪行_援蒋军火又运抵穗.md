　　Belgian Government's Crimes
　　More Pro-Chiang Kai-shek Military Supplies Arrive in Guangzhou
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Hong Kong on the 21st, the Belgian government has shipped another batch of approximately one hundred tons of weapons and ammunition to Guangzhou in support of Chiang Kai-shek. These weapons were manufactured by the Herstal state-owned arms factory in Belgium and transported by a French transportation company in Hong Kong. Agence France-Presse stated that this batch of military supplies is one of several batches purchased by the Chiang government and transported from Europe to Guangzhou. It is reported that the first batch of Belgian aid to Chiang, totaling one hundred and sixty tons, arrived in China last October, and the second batch of sixty tons was shipped from Belgium to Shanghai on February 6th of this year. A spokesman for the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a statement on July 7th of this year, strongly condemning the Belgian imperialists for following the American imperialists in aiding Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people.
