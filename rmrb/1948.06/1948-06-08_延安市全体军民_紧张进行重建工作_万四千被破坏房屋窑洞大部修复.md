Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th: The entire army and people of Yan'an are now actively engaged in restoration work with a high degree of intensity. In the month or more since liberation, all thirty-four deserted villages created by the bandit Hu have been restored, with the exception of eight natural villages where the cave dwellings were completely destroyed and are currently impossible to repair. Farmers, workers, and merchants who withdrew with our army have returned victoriously. The number of households and population in Yan'an City has now recovered to about three-quarters of pre-war levels. Most of the 9,548 flat houses and 5,437 public and private cave dwellings that were dismantled and destroyed by the bandit Hu have been repaired. More than a thousand soldiers and civilians dismantle wood and stone from the former bandit bunkers every day to repair destroyed cave dwellings. Staff members of various agencies in Yan'an City have responded to Chairman Lin's call and are working with their own hands to build houses in Wangjiaping, Yangjialing, the old city, the market, the South Gate, the East Gate, and Qiao'ergou. The Political Department of the Joint Defense Military Region, at its military personnel meeting on May 14th, determined a one-week construction plan, completing more than 290 workdays in six days, with an average of more than 40 people participating each day. The Border Region Government has allocated 100 million Northwest currency to repair the South Gate stone embankment, which was destroyed by the bandit Hu, and it is expected to be completed before the flood season.

　　延安市全体军民
    紧张进行重建工作
  　万四千被破坏房屋窑洞大部修复
    【新华社西北四日电】延安全体军民现正以高度紧张精神，积极进行恢复工作。解放后一个多月来，被胡匪制造的三十四个无人村，除八个自然村因窑舍尽毁，现尚无法整理外，其余全已恢复。随我军撤出的农民、工人、商人已胜利归来。现在延安市民户数及人口，已恢复到战前四分之三左右。曾被胡匪拆毁破坏的九千五百四十八间平房和五千四百三十七孔公私窑洞，大部分已予修复。每天从故匪碉堡内拆卸木料和石块进行修建被毁窑舍之军民，在千人以上。延市各机关工作人员响应林主席号召，自己动手，在王家坪、杨家岭及旧城、市场、南关、东关、桥儿沟等地，努力修建房舍。联防军区政治部在五月十四日该机关军人大会上，确定了一周修建计划，六天中共作了二百九十余个工，每天平均有四十余人参加。被胡匪破坏之南关石堤，边府已拨款西北本币一万万元予以修治，大水之前当可完工。
