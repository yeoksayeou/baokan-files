　　【Taihang News】 The Taihang District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a "Letter to Farmers, Party Members, and Village Cadres in the Entire District" on the 30th. It pointed out that after the land reform in the Taihang District, through the rent reduction and interest reduction movement from 1942 to 1945, the liquidation movement after the counter-offensive, and the land reform movement since 1946, the feudal system has generally been eliminated, and there are very few poor peasants and hired laborers who have not turned over. The task of land reform in the old and semi-old areas has been largely completed. According to Article 16 of the "Outline Land Law of China" promulgated by the Party Central Committee, in the future, we will not carry out another equal distribution movement in our district, but as Chairman Mao instructed: "Put the largest part of our energy into restoring and developing agricultural production and industrial production in towns and cities."

　　However, the production situation in our district this year, except for a few areas, is not vigorous enough, and it has not formed a warm movement like that of 1944, 1945, and 1946. Why is this so? We believe there are the following reasons:

　　Our Party's Land Policy is Not Absolutely Egalitarian

　　(1) In the past land reform movement, we led the farmers of the entire district to eliminate feudalism and satisfy the farmers' demands, which was completely correct and proper. However, in this great movement, due to the unclear policy thinking of some of our leading cadres and the incorrect class division, many middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses were also infringed upon; and landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes were not resettled in time. Especially since last winter and after the promulgation of the "Outline Land Law of China," erroneous ideas such as "absolute equality" and "poor peasant and hired laborer line," "poor peasant and hired laborer in power" were prevalent, and even some middle peasants were infringed upon in winter production, which greatly affected the production mood of the broad masses of middle peasants.

　　(2) Secondly, since the issue of party rectification was raised, good results have been achieved in hundreds of key point villages. However, among some party members, cadres, and masses in non-key point villages, some misunderstandings have occurred. In addition, some deviations have occurred in the intensive party rectification work in individual key point villages, causing many party members and village cadres to feel worried and uneasy, and even causing a phenomenon of passivity and lying down. For the past three or four months, most county and district cadres have been concentrated on experimenting with democratic party rectification in a few key point villages, and have not overcome this phenomenon in time, thus relaxing the leadership of the current production movement.

　　(3) A small number of counter-revolutionary elements have taken advantage of the shortcomings and errors in our above-mentioned work and the gaps, and taken advantage of the difficulties of mass diseases and disasters to carry out various sabotage activities: spreading rumors, bewitching the masses, gathering crowds to cause trouble, and armed robbery, thus creating some social unrest, which has affected the production mood of all classes.

　　Correction of Deviations is Not Yet Resolute and Requires Continued Efforts

　　In order to realize the important task of developing agricultural production and industrial production in towns, this article calls for combining the current production movement to expose the conspiracy activities of a small number of counter-revolutionary elements, so that they cannot deceive the masses and disrupt social order; at the same time, correct the shortcomings and errors in past work. Resolutely compensate middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses who have been wrongly struggled against, and resettle landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes. The article pointed out that although the District Party Committee has continuously instructed party leadership organs at all levels in the past six months to pay attention to preventing and correcting the shortcomings and errors in their work, and has already achieved great results: stopping indiscriminate beating and killing, stopping infringement on middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses, and stopping sweeping people out of their homes, etc.; however, due to insufficient inspection and supervision and education of cadres, the problems left over from the past have not been completely resolved—middle peasants and industrial and commercial businesses who have been wrongly struggled against have not been fully and appropriately compensated, and landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes have not been fully and appropriately resettled, and the ideological confusion of cadres has not been completely clarified. This requires our continued efforts.

　　In order to make all our people and all party members fully understand our party's policies and principles, here we make the following explanations based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the actual situation in our district:

　　(1) The feudal exploitation system in our old and semi-old areas has been largely eliminated, and land has been largely equally distributed, and middle peasants have become the majority of the rural population. Therefore, according to Article 16 of the "Outline Land Law of China," we will not carry out another equal distribution of land, but only carry out some necessary adjustments. Some people think that the policy of filling gaps proposed by our party is an absolutely mechanical leveling, which is completely wrong. In the old and semi-old areas, the land of middle peasants and new-style rich peasants will basically remain untouched in the future, and they should be allowed to retain more land than ordinary farmers (for the surplus land of a small number of middle peasants, some can be freely donated under the principle of genuine voluntariness, but it must never be forced).

　　(2) We implement land reform in order to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation systems and remove obstacles to the development of production, and it is by no means an unconditional "struggle against the wealthy," so the industrial and commercial businesses in our liberated areas (including the industrial and commercial businesses of landlords and rich peasants) must be protected. We must never infringe on them on the pretext that industrial and commercial operators exploit apprentices, shop assistants, and workers, or on the pretext that certain industrial and commercial businesses belong to landlords and rich peasants. Because the development of industrial and commercial businesses is necessary for the people's livelihood and the interests of the new democratic state. The facts in our district in the past two years have also shown that struggling against industrial and commercial businesses is detrimental to the masses and the entire liberated area. Wherever industrial and commercial businesses have been seriously infringed upon (such as in Wu'an and Qinyang), not only do workers and staff feel threatened by unemployment, but also the poor people in the towns cannot find a way out because of the sluggish market. At the same time, farmers cannot satisfactorily exchange their agricultural products for what they need, and various side businesses in the countryside are also greatly affected, making the rural economy stagnant. These lessons should be learned by all of us.

　　Party Rectification is to Rectify the Party Well, Party Comrades Should Actively Rise Up.

　　(3) The purpose of our party rectification is to remove the impure problems within the party, improve the awareness and working ability of all our party members, so that the party can completely stand in the same direction as the broadest working masses and lead them forward. The vast majority of our rural branches are generally pure in composition. According to the results of experiments in many key point villages during this period, only a small number of comrades have made mistakes, and most party members are still basically good. The policy we adopt towards all party members who have made mistakes is: distinguish right from wrong, distinguish importance from lightness, distinguish public from private, educate and transform, and treat the illness to save the person. Many village cadres and party comrades who have passively lain down due to temporary misunderstandings should quickly wake up and actively rise up. A communist party member should be a good hired hand of the people. Passively lying down cannot be considered a good hired hand of the people, and therefore cannot be considered a good party member.

　　(4) Establishing a democratic system at the village level and helping village cadres establish a democratic style is an extremely important issue in our rural work in the future. In order to solve this problem, we are experimenting with the people's representative assembly system in key point villages, which will be promoted throughout the district in the future (but non-key point villages should not spontaneously establish it, because it is dangerous to universally promote a system before experience is mature). On the other hand, there are now many people who misunderstand democracy, thinking that "democracy" means "whoever wants to do whatever they want," and arbitrarily use democracy as an excuse to infringe on the interests of others without reason, and even arbitrarily violate government decrees and things that have been agreed upon by the masses in the village, thus making it impossible for village cadres to do things and causing many chaos and disputes within the masses. Clearly, this kind of "democracy" is completely different from the real democracy we want to implement. We call this erroneous democracy anarchist extreme democracy without leadership. We communists are opposed to this kind of extreme democracy, because extreme democracy violates the interests of the majority of the people and violates the principles of democracy. We advocate the implementation of democracy in order to protect the democratic and legitimate rights of all people (which could not be protected in the past feudal rule era), but extreme democracy precisely infringes on the legitimate rights of the people and violates the interests of the new democratic state. Of course, people who have just been liberated from feudal oppression lack democratic habits, and the tendency of extreme democracy is inevitable. Village cadres and all party members must guide the broad masses of people to correctly exercise their democratic rights in practical life, and must never curb the people's democratic demands because of the tendency of extreme democracy.

　　The article finally called on all party, government, military, and civilians to make a hundred times more efforts to carry out the great production movement, increase agricultural production, protect and develop our industrial and commercial businesses, in order to increase support for the front lines and improve the lives of the people in the liberated areas. Correct past mistakes in the production movement: always be vigilant about the activities of a small number of counter-revolutionary elements, stabilize social order; improve the awareness of party members and cadres, transform the style of party members and cadres, strengthen the relationship between the party and the masses, and establish a democratic life in the countryside.

### 太行区党委号召全区党员和人民　恢复发展农工业生产

　　太行区党委号召全区党员和人民
  　恢复发展农工业生产
    【太行消息】中共太行区党委三十日发出“告全区农民、党员及村干部书”。指出：太行区土地改革经过一九四二年到一九四五年的减租减息运动，反攻后的清算运动，以及一九四六年以来的土地改革运动，封建制度一般的已被消灭了，贫雇没有翻身的也很少了；老区和半老区土地改革的任务，大体上已经完成了。根据我党中央所公布的“中国土地法大纲”第十六条的规定，今后在我区就不是重新来一次平分运动，而是如毛主席所指示的：“把我们的精力的最大部分，放在恢复和发展农业生产及市镇上的工业生产上面”。
    但是我区今年的生产情况，除了少数地区而外，却都不够起劲，没有形成象一九四四、四五、四六年那样热烈的运动。为什么会这样呢？我们认为有以下几点原因：
    我党土地政策不是绝对平均
    （一）在过去的土地改革运动中，我们领导全区农民，消灭了封建，满足了农民要求，这是完全应该的，正确的。但是在这个伟大的运动中，由于我们某些领导干部政策思想不明确，也没有正确的划阶级，所以也侵犯了不少中农和工商业；有些扫地出门的地主富农，也没有及时安置。特别是去年冬季以来和“中国土地法大纲”公布之后、流行着“绝对平”和“贫雇路线”、“贫雇当权”等错误思想，甚至在冬季生产中也侵犯了一些中农，这就大大影响了广大中农群众的生产情绪。
    （二）其次，自从整党问题提出之后，在几百个基点村取得了很好的效果，但在非基点村的一部分党员、干部和群众中间，却发生了一些误解，加以个别的点村大整党工作中出了些偏向，使得不少党员和村干部疑虑不安，甚至发生消极躺倒的现象；而三四个月以来，多数县区干部，又集中在少数基点村实验民主整党，没有及时克服这种现象，因而使当前生产运动的领导松懈下来。
    （三）少数反革命分子，利用我们上述工作中的缺点、错误和空隙，利用群众疾病、灾荒的困难，乘机进行各种破坏活动：散布谣言，蛊惑群众，聚众滋扰，武装抢劫，因而造成某些社会秩序的不安现象，影响了各阶层的生产情绪。
    纠偏还不坚决需要继续努力
    为了实现发展农业生产和城镇中的工业生产的重大任务，该文号召结合当前的生产运动，揭穿少数反革命分子的阴谋活动，使他们不得欺骗群众，不得扰乱社会治安；同时，纠正过去工作中的缺点和错误。坚决进行补偿错斗中农和工商业，安置扫地出门的地主富农。该文指出区党委最近半年来，虽然曾不断的指示各级党的领导机关，注意防止并纠正工作中的缺点和错误，并且也已经收到了很大的成效：停止了乱打、乱杀，停止了侵犯中农与工商业，停止了扫地出门等等；但是由于检查督促以及对干部的教育作得不够，所以过去遗留下来的问题还未得到彻底解决——错斗中农、工商业，没有完全得到适当补偿，扫地出门的地主富农也未完全适当安置，同时干部思想上的混乱也还没有完全澄清，这是需要我们继续努力的。
    为着使我们全体人民及全体党员，完全明了我党的政策和方针，在这里我们根据我党中央的指示和我区的实际情况，特作如下的几点解释：
    （一）我们的老区半老区封建剥削制度大体上已被消灭了、土地大体上已经实现平分，中农已经成了农村人口的大多数。因此，依照“中国土地法大纲”第十六条规定，不重新再来一次平分土地运动，只是进行一些必要的调剂。有些人以为我党所提出的填补政策，就是绝对的机械的推平，这是完全错误的。老区半老区，中农和新式富农的土地，今后基本上不动，应该允许他们保有比一般农民为多的土地（对于少数中农的多余土地，在真正自愿原则下，可以自由献出一些，但绝对不得强迫）。
    （二）我们实行土地改革，是为着要消灭封建和半封建的剥削制度，扫除发展生产的障碍，绝不是无条件的“斗争老财”，所以对于我们解放区内的工商业（包括地主富农的工商业在内），是必须加以保护的。绝不能借口工商业者剥削学徒、店员、工人，或借口某些工商业是属于地主富农而加以侵犯。因为发展工商业是人民生活与新民主主义国家利益所必须。我区二年以来的事实，也说明斗争工商业是对群众和整个解放区不利的，凡是严重的侵犯了工商业的地方（如武安、沁阳等），不但工人、职员感到失业的威胁，即城镇的贫苦人民也因为市场萧条而找不到生活出路，同时农民们也不能满意的以自己的农产品换到自己需要的东西，农村中的各种副业也受到很大影响，使农村经济死滞起来。这些教训，应该被我们大家所领受。
    整党是要把党整好，党员同志应积极起来。
    （三）我们实行整党的目的，是为了去掉党内不纯的毛病，提高我们所有党员的觉悟程度和工作能力，使党能够和最广大劳动群众完全站在一个方向，并领导他们前进。我们绝大多数农村支部，在成份上一般是纯洁的。根据这一时期许多基点村实验的结果来看，犯错误的同志只是一小部分，多数党员还是基本上好的。我们对所有犯错误的党员采取的方针是：分清是非轻重，分清为公为私，教育改造，治病救人。许多村干部和党员同志，因为一时误解而消极躺倒的，应该很快清醒起来、积极起来。共产党员应该是人民的一个好长工，消极躺倒便算不了人民的好长工，因而也就不能算是一个好党员。
    （四）树立村级的民主制度，帮助村干部树立民主作风，是我们今后农村工作中一个极其重要的问题。为了解决这一问题，我们在基点村实验着人民代表会制度，将来要推行全区（但非基点村不要自发的建立，因为一个制度，在经验成熟之前普遍推行是危险的）。另一主面，现在有不少人误解民主，认为“民主”就是“谁愿干啥就干啥”，随便借口民主，不讲道理侵犯其他人的利益，甚至任意违抗政府的法令，违抗村里已由群众议定的事情，因而使得村干部无法办事，群众内部发生许多混乱和纠纷。很明白的，这种“民主”，和我们所要实行的真正民主，是完全不相同的。这种错误的民主，我们把它叫做不要领导的无政府的极端民主。我们共产党人是反对这种极端民主的，因为极端民主，是违反多数人民利益的，是违反民主原则的。我们主张实行民主，是为着要使一切人民的民主合法权利，得到保护（过去封建统制时代是得不到保护的），但是极端民主，恰恰是侵犯人民合法权利的，是违反新民主主义国家利益的。当然，从封建压迫之下刚得解放的人民，是缺乏民主习惯的，极端民主的倾向是必不可免的，村干部和我党全体党员，必须在实际生活中引导广大人民正确的运用自己的民主权利，绝不能因为有极端民主的倾向而遏制人民的民主要求。
    该文最后号召所有党政军民，必须百倍努力开展大生产运动，增加农业生产，保护并发展我们的工商业，以增加支援前线的力量与改善解放区人民的生活。在生产运动中纠正过去的错误：要随时警惕少数反革命分子的活动，稳定社会秩序；要提高党员、干部的觉悟，改造党员、干部的作风，密切党与群众的关系，树立农村的民主生活。
