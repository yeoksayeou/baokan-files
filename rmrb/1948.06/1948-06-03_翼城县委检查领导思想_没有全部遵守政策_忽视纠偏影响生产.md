[Taiyue News] According to a report from the Yicheng County Committee, Yicheng held a nine-day rectification meeting starting on May 14th. At the meeting, the County Committee rigorously investigated and criticized past viewpoints that neglected rectification work. The "leftist" recklessness in Yicheng was very serious. Among the households struggled against in the county, 40% to 60% were middle peasants. Additionally, the burden on middle peasants was arbitrarily increased. For example, in Laoguanzhuang, the burden of over 900 mu of land that had been seized was placed entirely on the middle peasants. Labels of "spies" were casually applied. In Guanzhuang River, 70 households were labeled as spies, most of whom were middle peasants. In late April, there were even incidents of dragging and beating middle peasants. All of this seriously affected production. The County Committee examined why these serious issues were not seen, mainly because the one-sided viewpoints favoring poor peasants and hired laborers in the leadership's thinking had not been completely eradicated, and the decisions were still being made based on the opinions of a few people. When production rectification was planned this spring, although it was decided to stop all struggles and focus on production, losses of middle peasants were not compensated, and only general publicity was made. This made the call for rectification meaningless. The County Committee realized that at that time, the thinking was fear of retaliation by middle peasants against poor peasants and hired laborers, fear that poor peasants and hired laborers would be unable to return [land or property], and fear of trouble. There was a failure to understand that only by compensating the losses of middle peasants could they be united, could people's hearts be stabilized, and production enthusiasm be increased, and only then could "leftist" actions be completely stopped. Although the joint meeting of branch secretaries on April 20th began to recognize the seriousness of the problem, the "leftist" sentiments had not been thoroughly criticized, and there was still the attitude that "compensation is difficult" and "fear that poor peasants and hired laborers will be affected." Because of this, the understanding of the Party's policies and guidelines was general, abstract, one-sided, and distorted. Only a certain point was accepted, and the entire line was divided, and even developed, causing serious damage to the work. Secondly, bureaucratism in work style was also examined. There was a lack of in-depth investigation and research, only deployment without inspection, and a failure to understand the situation at lower levels. Some people fabricated facts in their work reports to show off their achievements, making them sound impressive. Bureaucratism prevented the detection of false reports, fueling the reckless behavior of a few people. For example, in Tianjiahe, forced mutual aid led to someone's death. In Qingcheng, mutual aid caused women to miscarry. More than 200 mutual aid groups in the Fifth District collapsed due to administrative orders. The meeting also formulated many specific rectification measures, but in general cadres, ideas such as "fear of losing face" and "fear of difficulties" have not been completely eliminated.

　　翼城县委检查领导思想
  　没有全部遵守政策
  　忽视纠偏影响生产
    【太岳消息】根据翼城县委报导，翼城从五月十四日起，连开了九天纠偏会议，会上县委严格清算了过去忽视纠偏工作的观点。翼城的左倾蛮干是很严重的，全县被斗户中有百分之四十到六十是中农，另外还随便加重中农负担。如老官庄把斗出来九百多亩地负担，完全加在中农身上，随便戴特务帽子，官庄河就有七十户被戴上特务帽子，其中大部是中农。四月下旬还发生拖打中农现象。这些都严重的影响了生产。县委检查了为什么看不见这些严重事情，主要是领导思想上片面的贫雇观点仍未肃清，决定方针还从少数人出发。如今春布置生产纠偏时，虽然决定停止一切斗争，全力进行生产，但对中农损失暂不补偿只作一般宣传，这是空叫纠偏。县委检查出当时的思想是怕中农对贫雇报复，怕贫雇退不出来，怕出乱子，没有了解只有补偿中农损失，才能团结中农安定人心提高生产情绪，左倾行动才能彻底停止。四月廿日分书联席会议上虽然开始认识到问题严重，但对左倾情绪及未彻底清算，仍然是“补偿有困难”，“怕贫雇受影响。”因为这样，所以对党的方针路线的认识是笼统的抽象的片面的歪曲的，接受了某一点即把整个路线分割了，甚至加以发展，这样造成对工作的严重损失。其次又检查出工作作风上的官僚主义，不深入调查研究，只有布置没检查，不了解下情，有些人汇报工作，为了表功捏造事实，说的有声有色，官僚主义看不见假报告，助长着少数人蛮干行为。如田家河互助逼死人，青城互助弄的妇女小产，五区二百多个互助组由于行政命令都垮了台。会上又订出了许多具体纠正的办法，但在一般干部中“怕丢人”“怕困难”等思想，还未彻底肃清。
