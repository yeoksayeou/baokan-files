Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th: The focus of Yan'an City's restoration work has shifted from organizing household registrations and repairing cave dwellings to restoring production and prospering the economy. Of the various handicraft workshops in the city, such as blacksmiths and carpenters, 114 have resumed operations, about half of the pre-war 255. This is an increase of 125% compared to the 46 during the enemy occupation. Among them are nine leather workshops representing special Northwest products. Before the war, the city had more than 3,000 itinerant workers, all of whom fled Yan'an during the enemy occupation and scattered to various places to make a living. Now, more than 200 have returned. Currently, 439 commercial firms in the city have resumed business, about 56% of the pre-war level, which is still 15 more than during the peak of the enemy occupation. Some of these stores are those that withdrew with our army and have now returned victoriously. One of the biggest difficulties for existing commercial firms is that their business during the enemy occupation mainly catered to the extravagant consumption needs of Chiang Kai-shek's military and political officials, and had no connection with the needs of the broad masses of the working people. As a result, current inventories are slow-moving, and capital turnover is difficult. The democratic government is now assisting them in transforming their businesses. In terms of agricultural production, the restoration work is extremely difficult due to the severe destruction caused by Chiang's army. Of the city's original 33,000 mu of cultivated land, 78% was occupied by the enemy for fortifications, "village consolidation" and the creation of no-man's land, and was thus abandoned. Of the original 770 yokes of oxen (two oxen per yoke), less than 100 yokes remain. Only 70 of the 500 mules and donkeys are left. Therefore, before the liberation of Yan'an, almost all farmland was abandoned. In recent months, thanks to the active rush-planting and rush-sowing by the entire military and civilian population, one-third of the cultivated land has been cultivated. Difficulties such as seeds and food grains have been partially resolved in some areas through mutual lending and adjustment. The democratic government is continuing to make proper arrangements for relief and is vigorously organizing farmers to continue cultivating barren land.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th: In the Yan'an sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, 41 fairs have now resumed trading, accounting for about 79% of the pre-war 52 fairs. Wayaobao, an important commercial town in northern Shaanxi, had 162 public and private shops and stalls before the war. Now, 110 have resumed business. When the enemy fled south from the city last October, they drove away more than 800 citizens, making it difficult for the city's commerce to recover for a time. By January of this year, only about 20 businesses had resumed operations. After Yan'an was recovered in April, most of the displaced citizens returned, and the government announced the exemption of business tax for last year and this year, so the commerce of Wayaobao quickly recovered. Salt and oil from Sanbian, cloth from Qingjian, and grain from Yanchang, Yichuan and other places are all collected and distributed here. The city's formerly developed silk weaving industry has now been restored in five locations. The government is currently planning to provide raw silk loans to solve its raw material difficulties. The original two market fairs in Zhidan County have been restored, and the number of commercial firms has increased from 43 in January to more than 80. The number of iron furnaces in Zhidan City has increased from two to six. In addition, markets such as Yichuan @ County Reclamation Area have resumed trading on a large scale, with grain as the main commodity.

　　延安市工作重心
  　恢复生产繁荣经济
    作坊商店五五三家复业
  　三分之一荒地完成耕种
    【新华社西北十四日电】延安市恢复工作之重心，已由整理户籍修补窑舍等，进至恢复生产繁荣经济。全市铁匠炉木匠铺等各业手工作坊，已恢复者有一百十四家，约为战前二百五十五家的一半，较之敌占时的四十六家即超过百分之一百廿五，其中有代表西北特产的皮坊九家。战前全市有三千余流动工人，敌占时全部逃离延安，散往各地另谋生路，现在返回者已有二百余人。全市商号恢复营业者，现已有四百三十九家，约为战前的百分之五十六，较之敌占时最盛时期仍超过十五家。其中若干商店，系随我军撤出，现又胜利返回者。目前旧有商号的最大困难之一，是敌占时业务，主要为适应蒋匪军政官员奢侈生活的消费需要，而与广大劳动人民需要毫无关系，以致现在存货滞销，资金周转困难，现民主政府正协助其转变业务。农业生产方面，由于蒋军之破坏深重，恢复工作至为艰巨。全市原有耕地三万三千亩，被敌强占挖筑工事，及实行“并村”制造无人区而荒芜的，占全部耕地之百分之七十八。原有之七百七十犋耕牛（每犋两头），现在残存者不及一百犋。五百头骡驴，现只剩七十头，因此当延市光复之前，农田几全部荒芜。近月来由于全体军民的积极抢耕抢种，已有三分之一耕地完成耕种。种籽吃粮等困难，若干地区经相互借贷调剂，已获部分解决，民主政府仍在继续妥筹救济，并大力组织农民继续耕种荒芜之土地。
    【新华社西北十四日电】陕甘宁延属分区，现已有四十一处市集恢复交易，约占战前五十二处市集的百分之七十九。陕北商业重镇瓦窑堡，战前原有公私商店和摊贩一百六十二家，现在恢复营业者有一百一十家。去年十月该市敌南逃时，将八百多市民驱走，使该市商业一时不易恢复，到今年一月份商号仅有二十余家恢复。四月延安收复后，被驱走之市民大部返回，政府又宣布豁免去年及今年的营业税，因此瓦市商业又迅速恢复。三边之食盐油，清涧等地之布匹，延长宜川等地之粮食均在此集散。该市向称发达之丝织业，现已有五家恢复。政府目前正拟贷以生丝，以解决其原料困难。志丹县原有之两处集市已恢复，商号由正月之四十三家增到八十余家。志丹市的铁炉，则由两处增至六处。此外如延川＠县垦区等地集市，已大量恢复交易，以粮食为大宗。
