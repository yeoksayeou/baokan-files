The Northern Yue Third District Committee Instructs All Counties to Vigorously Weed Seedlings and Eliminate Wasteland

[Chahar News] The Northern Yue Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all counties to intensify weeding and launch a concentrated effort to eliminate wasteland. According to reports from various counties, there is still a considerable amount of land in the Pingxi area that has not been sown, or has even been abandoned. The main reasons for this phenomenon are: After the land reform in the consolidated areas, many people were unwilling to cultivate poor land, resulting in its abandonment; a small number of families of military personnel, martyrs, and households lacking labor were unable to cultivate all their land due to a lack of labor, leading to the abandonment of poor land after cultivating the good land; and some people were even unwilling to cultivate more land for fear of shouldering burdens. In the border areas, the frequent enemy raids prevented the masses from engaging in production with peace of mind, resulting in many lands not being sown. According to recent statistics, Laishui still has more than 2,000 mu of land unsown, and the Lai-Zhuo border area has more than 4,000 mu unsown. Other counties also have a considerable amount of wasteland. Although a great effort has been made, it has not been completely eliminated. This spring, there has been abundant rainfall, and weeds grow easily, making it even more necessary to intensify weeding. The Third District Committee's instructions stated: In order to accomplish the above tasks, first, the families of military personnel, workers, and martyrs who lack labor must be taken care of, organized to help each other, or given assistance. Landlords and idlers must be supervised to encourage them to work. Those who have actual difficulties in production must be helped to solve them. Second, under the principle of voluntarism, vigorously organize mutual aid teams and constantly summarize experiences and persevere in order to solve the difficulties of draft animals. Mutual aid teams that were forcibly organized for the purpose of obtaining grain loans should be reformed. Third, the second phase of grain loans should be issued immediately to solve the difficulties in production. However, serious deviations such as equal distribution, improper use, or organizing mutual aid teams solely for the purpose of obtaining grain loans must be corrected. Fourth, except for war situations and grain transportation tasks, all other forms of corvée labor should be temporarily suspended. If it is necessary to mobilize corvée labor, it must be approved by the sub-district. Fifth, in the border areas, efforts should also be made to complete the above tasks. According to reports from various counties, the following methods can be considered for implementation: (1) Implement labor-military integration and launch a concentrated effort to seize the time to sow. (2) Strive to bring back fleeing households and help them organize production to rebuild their homes. (3) Find relatives of fleeing households to cultivate on their behalf. The county and district committees should dispatch all possible cadres, organize work teams, and go deep into the countryside to carry out a concentrated effort. Resolutely oppose leadership methods that merely stay at meetings to make general calls and arrangements, and instead, specifically go deep into the countryside to guide production with production. (The main thing is to specifically help and organize mass production - Editor) All government agencies, troops, and schools should also take time to help the masses in production.

　　北岳三地委指示各县
  　大力锄苗灭荒
    【察哈尔讯】中共北岳三地委指示各县加紧锄苗，突击消灭荒地。据各县汇报，平西地区仍有不少土地尚未播种，甚至荒了。造成这一现象的主要原因：巩固区土改后，很多人不愿种坏地，因而把地荒了；也有少数军工烈属及缺劳力户，因为没劳力种不过来，种了好地荒了坏地；甚至部分人因害怕负担，不愿多种地。在边缘区是因经常遭敌突袭，群众不能安心生产，以致很多地尚未播种。据最近统计，涞水尚有两千多亩地未种，涞涿边缘区尚有四千多亩未种，其他各县荒地也不少。虽经大力突击，仍未全部消灭。今春雨水充足，野草容易生长，更要加紧锄苗。三地委指示中提出：为了完成上述任务，第一、对于缺乏劳动力的军、工、烈属必须予以照顾，组织互助或加以帮助。对于地主二流子必须予以监督，促使他们劳动。对于在生产中有实际困难者，必须予以解决。第二，在自愿的原则下大力组织拨工互助，并随时总结经验，坚持下去，以解决耕畜困难。为了取得贷粮贷款或强制编起的拨工组，应予改造。第三，第二期贷粮贷款应即发下，以解决生产中的困难。但要纠正平均分配，或用之不当，以及为贷粮贷款而组织拨工的严重偏向。第四，除战争情况及运粮任务外，其他各种勤务一律暂时停止。如有需要动员勤务时，要经过分区批准。第五，在边沿区亦应设法完成上述任务，根据各县汇报，有以下几种办法，可考虑执行：（一）实行劳武结合，突击抢种。（二）争取逃亡户回来，帮助其组织生产重建家园。（三）找逃亡户亲戚代种。各县、区委应抽调一切可能抽调的干部，组织工作组，深入乡村进行突击。坚决反对光是停留在会议的布置号召一般性的领导方式上面，要具体的深入乡村以生产领导生产。（主要还应具体帮助与组织群众生产——编者）各机关、部队、学校亦要抽出时间帮助群众生产。
