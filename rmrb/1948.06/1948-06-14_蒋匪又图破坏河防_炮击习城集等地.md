　　【Ji-Lu-Yu News】 Second River Defense Office News: Ding Shixuan's unit, the 24th Regiment of the 81st Brigade of the 68th Division of the enemy entrenched in Dongming on the south bank of the Yellow River, attempted to sabotage our river defense agencies and reinforcement materials. Recently, they have been constantly shooting at the north bank with machine guns and rifles. On the 22nd of last month, the enemy stationed at Dawangzhuang suddenly fired at our ships and reinforcement materials parked at Zhangzhuang river mouth, and fired more than 20 times at Xicheng Laodaba material factory, our agency's station, and the innocent masses in villages along the river such as Yulin, Liuzhai, and Chenlou. Because we were prepared, no major losses were suffered in the villages along the river. Only three shells that landed in Xicheng killed and wounded a donkey each belonging to the masses. The masses in our riverine area hate the enemy's sinful behavior to the core.

　　蒋匪又图破坏河防
  　炮击习城集等地
    【冀鲁豫消息】第二修防处消息：盘踞黄河南岸东明之敌六十八师八一旅二四团丁世选部，企图破坏我河防机关及整险秸料，近日不断以机步枪向北岸射击。上月二十二日，驻大王庄之敌突然向我张庄河口停泊的船只秸料射击，并向习城老大坝料厂，和我机关驻地以及沿河之于林、刘砦、陈楼等村的无辜群众发炮二十余次，因我素有准备，沿河村内，均未遭受重大损失。仅落到习城的三个炮弹，炸死炸伤了群众的驴各一头。我沿河一带群众，对敌人的这种罪恶行为，莫不切齿痛恨。
