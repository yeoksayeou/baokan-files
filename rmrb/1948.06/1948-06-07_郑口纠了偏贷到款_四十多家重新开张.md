　　【Gucheng News】According to a detailed investigation, in Zhengkou, in addition to the 58 well-known shops that were struggled against, another eight were discovered, making a total of 48 that were struggled against and 18 that made "contributions," totaling 66. Of these 66, except for Fukang Cake and Sauce Shop and Xiecheng Machine Oil Mill, which have not yet been claimed, the rest have been reclaimed and have either reopened or are preparing to reopen. Some made "contributions" but did not stop operating, and some continued to operate under the name "Guang" after being struggled against. Over 40 businesses have now reopened after being returned. About ten businesses have not reopened because of unresolved housing issues. To support industry and commerce, the bank granted Zhengkou loans of 33 million yuan (another 3 million yuan was loaned to small merchants in Gucheng city). Of the 33 million yuan, 23 million yuan was lent to poor vendors at a monthly interest rate of two percent with no fixed term. Because there were many people who needed loans and the amount of money was small, the bank could not meet everyone's demands. At the group leader's joint meeting (loan group), the bank announced that each household could not borrow more than 100,000 yuan and the loan term could not exceed 20 days. The group leaders were dissatisfied. Bank comrades said, "There is too little money, so we have to limit the amount. In order to circulate it and enable more people to get loans, we have to limit the term." The newly reclaimed shops urgently request the government's loan support. (Lu Ziqing)

　　郑口纠了偏贷到款
  　四十多家重新开张
    【故城消息】郑口被斗商店，根据现在详细调查，除出名的五十八家以外，又发现了八家。共计斗的四十八家，献的十八家，共六十六家。这六十六家中，除福康饼酱店和协成机器油坊尚未来人接收外，其余都已接收，并且开张或正准备开张，其中有献后未停止营业的，有的被斗后改办广字号继续经营的。退还后现重新开张经营的有四十多家。退还后因房子问题没解决未开张的有十来家。为扶植工商业，银行给郑口贷款三千三百万元（另三百万元贷给故城城内的小商人）。三千三百万元中，二千三百万元是二分利不定期的贷给了贫苦摊贩。因须要贷款的人多，款子少，不能满足大家的要求，银行在组长联席会上（贷款组）宣布，每户不能超过十万元，日期不能超过二十天，组长们不满，银行同志说：“款子太少，不得不限数，为叫他流通开，使多数人都能贷到款，又不得不限期。”新接收的商店，迫切要求政府的贷款支持。（鲁子青）
