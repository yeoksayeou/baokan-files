　　After the War
    By Teluoyannuofusiji, translated by Fu Ke
    I.
    In May 1945, two divisions, one Soviet and one American, met near the town of Torgau in Germany. This meeting heralded the rapid end of the war and served as the best way to celebrate victory. The Soviet division commander hosted a grand luncheon for the American officers, and the next day, a large number of Soviet officers returned the favor at the American division commander's headquarters.
    Among these officers was Lieutenant Goyahemaitov, the platoon leader of a heavy mortar platoon. He had black, shiny hair, a wide, swarthy face, and strikingly dark eyes like charcoal; he was the only unique individual in our delegation. Perhaps because he was the only lieutenant of his kind, a black man approached him before lunch, extended his large, black hand, and said in Russian:
    —Lieutenant Polly Smithweison of the American Army.
    The new friends began to talk. And the two of them were always together at meals.
    It turned out that their usual professions were both teachers, and in 1943 they were both sent to the front lines. During the war, both Polly Smithweison and Goyahemaitov commanded a heavy mortar platoon in their respective units.
    —An interesting coincidence, — Goyahemaitov said, as if making a discovery.
    Polly Smithweison shook his hand and said:
    —It is an honor to meet you.
    They spoke in both Russian and English, asking each other a series of wide-ranging questions.
    —Where were you born? — the American asked.
    —Born in Tashkent, — Goyahemaitov replied. Smithweison said loudly:
    —Tashkent, Kazakhstan, Central Asia! I know, I've read about it.
    —And you? — Goyahemaitov asked.
    —Charlotte City.
    —I know, I've read about it, — another Soviet lieutenant interjected, — in North Carolina, near the Catawba River.
    To satisfy his new friend's request, Goyahemaitov recounted his pre-war life: his father was a shepherd for a large landowner in Kazakhstan. In 1926, he left the landowner himself and worked as a handyman at the Yales railway station not far from Tashkent. There he learned to read and write, and later went to work in his hometown. In Tashkent, Galimo Goyahemaitov entered school. Galimo was the first child from Goyahemaitov's background to attend a regular city school.
    —Before the revolution, — Goyahemaitov said, — there were no Kazakh schools in Tashkent or other cities in Kazakhstan. The Tsarist government considered us barbarians and treated us as such. The Soviet authorities treated us as equals with Russians, Ukrainians, and Georgians. We Kazakhs are moving towards a higher stage of life. Now we have everything—industry, collective farms, our own literature, our own music, our own schools and universities, our own theaters, our own roads, our own government…
    —I understand, I understand… you have socialism, — Polly Smithweison said.
    —After graduating from middle school, — Goyahemaitov continued, — I wanted to go to Moscow, to Moscow University…
    —Hey, that's wonderful! — the American interrupted.
    —At that time, my father was a technician in a steel mill, which was built in Tashkent according to the Five-Year Plan. He agreed with me and sent me to Moscow. At the university, the authorities told me that many applications had been submitted to the history department, and there would be a big entrance competition. I felt that I was fully prepared, so I submitted my application. In the competitive examination, I ranked ahead of many of my classmates.
    I became a college student. After graduating from university in 1939, I wanted to stay in Moscow… I love Moscow, I especially like Moscow, but I have my own Tashkent, I have my hometown. I went home. Before the war, I was a middle school principal in Tashkent. And my father, after graduating from a technical night school, worked as a day shift engineer in an electrical factory. That's my experience. Polly, I also have a wife and two children at home, who are waiting for me in Tashkent. I will go after the victory.
    After he described his life, Polly Smithweison said:
    —I am a black man, — he sighed, — and for black people, Galimo, life in the United States is very difficult. In 1922, my father died at the hands of white bandits; and my brother taught me to read. We have no rights, but I finally graduated from a vocational school. Became a teacher. Of course, it's not good to have no freedom, it's simply impossible to live without freedom, and my life soon became painful. How to live? I have knowledge, I taught myself Russian, I can speak French, Spanish, German... I have read Tolstoy and Zola, and also read Goethe and Shakespeare, Byron and Cervantes… but what good is this to a black man? He has black skin, and any white, illiterate rogue can kill him… In 1939, three such white rogues caught me on the street in my hometown, beat me mercilessly, and then I was sued. As a result, I was the criminal, not them. That's how I went to jail…
    He paused. Goyahemaitov did not interrupt his difficult and painful silence.
    —But you know, Galimo, — Polly Smithweison said, raising his voice a little more than before, — there are many things that should be changed and reformed in our country now… The war has taught our country many things, and now no one will believe that people like me with this skin will be killed again in our country… I believe in this, I fought for this.
    At this time, two generals—one Soviet and one American—walked up to the lieutenants. The Soviet general raised his glass and toasted Polly and Galimo, saying:
    —Let's drink to friendship, friends!
    The American general clinked glasses with Goyahemaitov and then stepped back. Polly also turned away, pretending not to see his general.
    At four o'clock in the morning, the Soviet officers were preparing to return. Polly and Galimo exchanged military post office box numbers and bid farewell.

    II.
    In early 1946, Lieutenant Galimo Goyahemaitov returned to his hometown of Tashkent after being demobilized. At the station, he was met by his relatives, comrades, and classmates. He became the principal of a middle school again, and in the summer he took a trip to Kazakhstan, seeing how much his homeland had changed during the war!
    Three years—the time is not long, but in the three years of the Soviet state, how many large and strong fruits have grown!
    Goyahemaitov was amazed by Amudariya. He remembered it as a quiet, clean small city near the mountains. Now, before his eyes, it had become a large industrial city. Walking along the bustling streets, he could not count the newly built houses. Streetcars rang, and mine cars moved silently along the railway. Dozens of newly built factories and manufacturing plants had tall chimneys that emitted black smoke.
    Galimo marveled at the Kazakh fields and grasslands. The fields had expanded, with many tractors and combines working on them. And on the grasslands, flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and horses were grazing peacefully. Kazakhstan's rural economy and animal husbandry had advanced greatly during the war.
    In the winter of 1947, Galimo Goyahemaitov was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh Soviet Republic. He wrote a thesis on the history of his homeland and became a candidate for historical sciences. In the summer, Galimo's wife gave birth to a daughter.
    That same summer, Galimo recalled his meeting with the black man in the town of Torgau in Germany and sent him a letter.

    III.
    This October, from Charlotte City in distant North Carolina, a letter was sent using the military post office box number of the army in which Galimo served during the war:
    "My dear, happy comrade… Polly Smithweison wrote—Do you remember our meeting near Torgau at our division commander's luncheon? Do you remember those three gentle and kind Russian words that your Soviet general said to us both? Do you remember that the American general was unwilling to drink a sip of whiskey next to me? This was just the first, not too big, blow to my illusions after defeating Germany…
    When I was demobilized in 1945, they didn't even give me a second-class cabin on the ship. Black people and white people can't walk together! In New York, they kicked me out of a tavern, where white people can enjoy themselves with wine, but there is no place for black people? Later, I bought a plane ticket, but some white lady didn't want to take off next to a black man. You Soviets probably think this is too rude, but this is our life, this is the reality of America.
    What will my life be like in the future—it's really painful and heartbreaking to talk about. In my hometown of Charlotte City, they closed the black schools. Do you know what kind of work I do now? I am the driver of a large garbage truck that collects garbage on the streets of Charlotte every morning. My brother also died of lung disease last year.
    This is what I fought for, Galimo. Here, many people are talking about war again. For the sake of profit, these people are scolding you, scolding your country… They beat and scold us black people… How I envy you, my happy comrade!
    You don't mind me calling you comrade, do you? After all, I am not a teacher now. I am a truck driver. But I have not abandoned my knowledge. I still read a lot of books as before. A truck driver who collects garbage on the streets of an American city is still reading Byron, Goethe, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy…
    It is difficult to do this under the rule of Truman and Vandenberg, but I simply cannot live without reading.
    Friend, as long as we look forward, we will not lose our way. Because there is the Soviet Union and Stalin in the world!
    Congratulations to you and your country, Galimo, for even greater happiness and prosperity. Shake hands. This is being sent by military mail, because that way they don't investigate the addresses on the envelopes.
                                                        Yours, Polly Smithweison"

　　战争之后
    特洛岩诺夫斯基  作  付克  译
    一、
    一九四五年五月的日子里，苏联和美国的两个师在德国托尔卡乌城的附近相会了。这相会显示了战争的迅速结束，并成为庆祝胜利的最好的方法。苏军师长以盛大的午餐宴请了美军的军官们，而过了一天，大批的苏联军官便又去美军师长那儿回宴了。
    在这些军官中，有个重迫击炮排的排长——哥亚赫麦托夫中尉，他有黑色发光的头发，宽宽的浅黑色的面孔，突出的象炭一样特别乌黑的眼睛；在我们的代表中，只有他是个特殊的人。可能因为他是仅有的这样一个中尉，而在午饭前，又向他走来了一个黑人，这人伸出他那又黑又大的手，讲着俄国话说：
    ——美军的中尉波里·斯密威逊。
    新交的朋友便谈论起来了。而且他们两人总是在一起吃饭。
    事情是这样的巧，原来他们俩平时的职业都是教员，而在一九四三年他们俩都开到前线。波里·斯密威逊和哥亚赫麦托夫，战时在自己的部队中，两人都指挥着一个重迫击炮排。
    ——有趣的巧合，——哥亚赫麦托夫若有发现的说。
    波里·斯密威逊握着他的手说：
    ——我们同你们的相会，这是件荣幸的事。
    他们又讲俄国话，又讲英国话，相互问询了一些漫无边际的问题。
    ——你生在什么地方？——美国人问。
    ——生在塔什干，——哥亚赫麦托夫答。斯密威逊高声说：
    ——塔什干，卡察赫斯坦，中亚细亚！知道，读过
    ——你呢？——哥亚赫麦托夫问。
    ——沙尔洛特城。
    ——知道，读过，——另一个苏军中尉打断了他的话说，——在北加罗林州，靠近山矶河。
    为了满足这位新朋友的请求，哥亚赫麦托夫叙述了他自己战前的平生经历：父亲是卡查赫壹家大地主的牧人。一九二六年他自己离开了那个大地主，在距塔什干不远的亚雷斯火车站当了一名小工。他在那里学会了读书写字，以后便到故乡的城镇去工作了，在塔什干，加里莫·哥亚赫麦托夫进了学校。所有象哥亚赫麦托夫出身的人，加里莫是第一个进了正规的城市的学校的孩子。
    ——革命前，——哥亚赫麦托夫说，——不管在塔什干或在卡察赫斯坦的其他城市里，没有卡察赫人的学校，沙皇政府认为我们是野蛮人，所以就把我们拿野蛮人来看待。苏维埃当局把我们同俄罗斯人，乌克兰人及乔治亚人以平等相待。我们卡察赫人正向着生活的更高阶段迈进，现在我们什么都有了——工业，集体农庄，自己的文学，自己的音乐，自己的学校和大学，自己的剧院，自己的道路，自己的政府…………
    ——懂得，懂得，………你们有社会主义，——波里·斯密威逊说。
    ——我在中学毕了业，——哥亚赫麦托夫继续说，——就想去莫斯科，去莫斯科大学………
    ——嘿，这是多么美满啊！——美国人截断他的话说。
    ——这时我父亲在一个炼钢厂里当技工，这工厂是按五年计划在塔什干建筑起来的。他同意了我的意见，便把我送到莫斯科去了。在大学里，当局告诉我说，已交来了很多进历史系的入学申请书，这要成为一个很大的入学竞赛呢。我觉得我已有了充分的准备，所以我便递上了申请书。在竞赛考试中，我列在我许多同学的前面了。
    我成了大学生。在一九三九年大学毕了业，我想留在莫斯科………我爱莫斯科，我特别喜欢莫斯科，但是我有我自己的塔什干，我有我的故乡城镇，我回家了。战前我在塔什干当中学校长。而我的父亲在技术夜校毕业后，就在电气工厂当了日班工程师，这就是我的经历。波里，我家中还有妻子和两个孩子，他们在塔什干等待着我呢，胜利之后我就去。
    他叙述了自己的平生后，波里·斯密威逊说：
    ——我是黑人，——他叹了口气说，——而对于黑人来说，加里莫，生活在美国是非常困难的。一九二二年我的父亲死在白种人匪徒的手里了；而我的哥哥就教我读书。我们没有任何的权力，可是我终于在专科学校毕了业。当了教员。没有自由当然不好，没有自由就简直不能生活，而我的生活很快就痛苦起来了，怎样过活呢？我有知识，我自己学会了俄文，我会说法国话，西班牙话，德国话……我读过托尔斯泰和左拉的东西，也读过哥德和沙士比亚，拜伦和西万提斯的作品……但这对于黑人有什么用呢？他有黑色的皮肤，而随便一个白色不识字的流氓就可以把他杀死………一九三九年，三个这样的白流氓在故乡的大街上把我捕起来，无情的打了我一顿，以后我就被告了。结果，罪犯是我，而不是他们。这样我就入狱了………
    他停了一下。哥亚赫麦托夫没有打断他这种艰难痛苦的沉默。
    ——可是你知道，加里莫，——波里·斯密威逊比以前的声音提高了些说，——现在在我国有许多应该转变改革的事………战争中很多事情教育了我们的国家，现在没有一个人会相信，在我国又开始杀害象我这种皮肤的人了…………我相信这件事，我为这件事去打过仗。
    这时向中尉走来了两位将军——苏联的和美国的。苏联将军举杯向波里和加里莫碰杯说：
    ——为友谊干杯吧，朋友们！
    美国将军同哥亚赫麦托夫碰杯后就向后退走了。波里也背过身去，装着没有瞧见自己的将军。
    早上四点钟苏联军官便准备回去了。波里和加里莫交换了军邮的番号就握别了。
    二、
    一九四六年初，加里莫·哥亚赫麦托夫中尉复员后回到了塔什干的故乡。在车站上，他的亲戚、同志、同学都遇见了他。他又当了中学校长，而夏天他到卡察赫斯坦看了一趟，在战争期间他的祖国有了多大的变化啊！
    三年——时间并不长，但是在苏维埃国家的三年中，生长了多少肥大果实并如此的壮大起来了啊！
    哥亚赫麦托夫为阿穆达里亚所惊奇了。他记得它是多么僻静的清洁的靠近大山的一座小城市呢。现在在他的眼前它已成为一座大的工业城市了。他沿着热闹的街市走着，他计算不完这些新筑的房屋了。电车响着，矿车沿着铁路无声的转动着。数十个新建的工厂和制作厂，高高得烟筒上冒着黑烟。
    加里莫惊叹着卡察赫的田野和草原。田野扩大了，上边有许多托拉机和康拜因。而在草原上羊群、牛群、马群，正在安静的吃草。卡察赫斯坦的农村经济和畜产业在战时已大大的前进了。
    一九四七年的冬天，加里莫，哥亚赫麦托夫被选为卡察赫苏维埃共和国最高苏维埃的代表。他写了关于祖国历史学术的论文，并成为历史科学家的候补人。夏天加里莫家里生了个女儿。
    就在这年夏天，加里莫回忆起了在德国特尔卡乌城同黑人的相会并给他寄了一信。
    三、
    今年十月间，从辽远的北加罗林州的沙尔洛特城，用加里莫在战时服务的军队的军邮番号寄来了这样一封信：
    “我的亲爱的幸福的伙伴………波里·斯密威逊写道——你还记得在特尔卡乌附近，我们同你们相会在我们师长那儿的午餐吧！你记得你们苏联将军到我们俩那儿讲的那三个温和良善的俄国字吗？你记得美国将军不愿在我旁边喝一口威斯吉酒吗？这仅仅是在战胜德国后，对我的幻想初次的不太大的一次打击罢了………
    我在一九四五年复员后，他们连船上的二等舱都没有给我。黑人同白人不能在一起走路的！在纽约他们把我从一个酒馆里赶出来，而在这个酒馆里白人是可以乘酒作乐的，哪有黑人的地方？以后我买了飞机票，当时有个什么样的白人太太竟不愿在黑人旁边起飞，你们苏联人，觉得这太粗野了吧，然而这就是我们的生活，这就是美国的实际。
    今后我的生活怎么办呢，——说起来真是痛苦伤心。在我的故乡沙尔洛特城市里，他们封闭了黑人的学校。你知道我现在干什么工作呢？我当了沙尔洛特街上每天清早垃圾的大汽车的车夫了，我的哥哥也在去年得肺病死了。
    我就是为了这个，加里莫，去打过仗呢。在我们这里有很多人又在谈论战争了。这些人为了利润，他们在骂你们，骂你们的国家………他们打骂我们黑人………我是如何的羡慕你呀，我的幸福的伙伴！
    我称呼你伙伴你不生气吧？本来现在我不是教员了。我是汽车夫。但是我没有丢弃我的知识，象从前一样我读了很多书。在美国的城市的大街上收集垃圾的汽车夫，还在读着拜伦、哥德、沙士比亚和托尔斯泰的作品呢………
    在杜鲁门和范登堡的统治下这样做是很困难的，但是不读书我简直就不能生活。
    朋友，只要我们向前看就不会失迷路途的。因为世界上有苏联和斯大林啊！
    祝贺你和你们国家，加里莫，更幸福更繁荣。握手。这是由军邮寄发的，因为这样他们不调查信封上的地址的。
