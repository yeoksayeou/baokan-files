　　Liberate Young Intellectuals of the Chiang Army
  　Participate in Our Army's Work
    [Huaibei Frontline, 16th Dispatch] Frontline reporter Lin Jian reports: More than 50 young intellectuals from the Chiang Youth Army's 208th Division and the Third Army, who were liberated in the Qingfengdian and Shijiazhuang campaigns, voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army after a short period of study, and have been approved by a certain unit of our Liberation Army. When they joined the army, the unit held a welcome meeting, at which Director Li of the Political Department spoke, clarifying our Party's policy towards intellectuals, welcoming all intellectuals willing to serve the people to participate in revolutionary work, regardless of their origins. Even young intellectuals from exploiting classes are welcome as long as they abandon their original class stand and resolutely stand on the side of the people. They have now been assigned to cultural and educational work in various propaganda and education departments. Zhao Fengsheng, a former clerk of the 208th Division of the Chiang Youth Army, has been assigned to this work and expressed great joy. He is from Shijiazhuang, 20 years old, and studied at the private Shimen Middle School. He later worked in the locomotive section of the Shimen Railway Bureau and joined the Youth Army due to hardship. He was liberated in the Qingfengdian campaign. He said, "I have also suffered for two years, so I know the suffering of the broad masses of the proletariat. I want to serve the people to the end." Another youth, Liu Rongji, said, "My highest ideal in the future is to join the Communist Party of China in order to better serve the people." Liu is from Yuanshi and studied at the Shijiazhuang Jianguo Middle School. He is only 19 years old. Last year, he joined the 208th Division of the Youth Army and was liberated by us in the Qingfengdian campaign. He is now working in a certain political department of our army. Gao Zhongguang, formerly of the 8th Company of the 20th Regiment of the Chiang bandit Third Army, and Liang Yimin of the 208th Division of the Youth Army, both expressed great joy in participating in our army's work. Gao Zhongguang said that everything in the People's Liberation Army is new to him, and this is the beginning of a new life.
