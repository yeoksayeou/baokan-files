Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a Shanghai magazine, Shaanxi cotton farmers are generally bankrupt under the monopoly control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the exploitation of usury. Last June and July, cotton farmers generally borrowed money through the "advance on cotton" method, selling part of the young cotton plants at a low price of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per dan, or borrowing and repaying with the market price per dan when the new cotton came on the market, ranging from 560,000 to 1,890,000. The interest on general loans was as high as 30 to 50 percent, so that when the new cotton came on the market, most of the cotton farmers' produce was plundered by the landlords and speculators. Even the small amount of cotton left was losing money due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's monopoly control and manipulation of the market. For example, in mid-September last year, the selling price was 950,000 yuan per dan, while the production cost converted to the then currency value was 1,250,000 yuan. This year, the Chiang government's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee was established, and it carried out open plunder under the name of "unified purchase." From January to mid-February, the China Textile Corporation purchased Shaanxi cotton at a price of 3,150,000 yuan per dan, while the production cost of cotton, calculated according to the rising proportion of various commodity prices, was 4,750,000 yuan per dan in January and 5,750,000 yuan in February. The cotton farmers lost 1,600,000 to 2,600,000 yuan per dan.

　　在蒋匪垄断剥夺下
  　陕西棉农多破产
    【新华社陕北三日电】据上海某杂志披露：陕西棉农在蒋家匪帮垄断统制以及高利贷等剥夺下，普遍陷于破产状态。去年六七月间棉农均以“支花”办法向人借贷，先将一部分青苗以每担三十至四十万元低价出售或先借用，每担市价俟新花上市时归还，一担五六至一担八九不等，至一般贷款利息则均高及三十至五十分钱，致新花上市时，棉农所有大部为豪绅投机商所掠夺，即剩下少量棉花，亦因蒋匪垄断统制操纵市场而亏蚀血本。如去年九月中旬，每担售价九十五万元，而生产成本折合当时币值却达一百二十五万元，今年一月蒋政府花纱布管理委员会成立，更在“统购”名义下，实行公开掠夺。中纺公司于一月至二月中旬收购陕棉定价每担三百十五万元，而棉花生产成本按各种物价上涨比例计算，一月每担为四百七十五万元，二月为五百七十五万元，棉农亏蚀成本每担即达一百六十万至二百六十万元。
