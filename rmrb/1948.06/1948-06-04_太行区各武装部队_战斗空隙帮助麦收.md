　　Taihang Area Armed Forces
  　Help with Wheat Harvest During Combat Breaks
    [Taihang News] The Jixian Brigade of the Fifth Military Subdistrict has begun helping the masses with the wheat harvest during breaks in combat. The First Company, in Sulancun, Second District, helped harvest 174.5 mu of wheat in three and a half days. Yan Duoying, despite having sores, voluntarily boiled water and carried water for the comrades and villagers. The Second Company, in Taigong×, helped harvest, carry, cut, and thresh wheat on 77.4 mu in three days, cut wheat ears on 15.5 mu, threshed wheat on 14.5 mu, cut wheat stalks on 10 mu, and carried 139 loads of water, and pushed more than 20 small carts of manure (plus one pile of manure), receiving enthusiastic support from the masses. An old man bought three packs of cigarettes and insisted that the soldiers smoke them; an old woman, seeing that the troops had no vegetables for lunch, brought out her own vegetables to give to the soldiers. The masses offered many eggs, garlic stalks, spinach, bean sprouts, etc., to comfort the troops, but they were all declined. The relationship between the military and the people has shown unprecedented harmony.
    [Taihang News] In the area where a certain field army unit of the military region is stationed, the wheat harvest of the masses has begun. The Political Department of the unit called on all comrades to solve the labor shortage difficulties of the masses, strengthen the relationship between the military and the people, take three days of study time, and all go out to help the masses harvest. Cadres also stopped office work during these three days, and the following disciplines were established: (1) Obey the command of the host family, and go wherever they tell you to go. (2) Cut the wheat cleanly, strive not to lose any wheat ears, and carry them when you have time. (3) Do not smoke a single cigarette from the masses, do not take anything from the masses, and do not ask the masses to cook or deliver water. In ×× village, with a population of 300, 100 mu were harvested in one day. Livestock were also prepared to help pull the wheat, which had a great impact on the masses. Some said that the Eighth Route Army is really good, they cut our wheat and don't even drink our water. We really feel bad about it, and we will help our army overcome difficulties in the future. They also proposed to help the masses rush to sow after the rain. (Sun Weifan, Yang Zhanqi)
    [Northern Henan News] With the wheat ripening soon, the Kunlun Mountain troops on the front line in northern Henan, in order to protect the wheat harvest of the masses in Yexian, Tangdong, and Zhangnan counties, and to smash the plan of the Chiang Kai-shek diehard bandit army in Anyang to seize wheat, issued instructions on May 27, calling on the entire army to protect the wheat harvest with arms, not allowing the Chiang Kai-shek diehard bandit army to seize a single grain of wheat, and to do the following things well: (1) Make the entire army realize the great significance of this wheat protection, not only to ensure that the masses in Yexian, Tang, and Zhang counties have food to eat, but also to make a significant impact on the siege of Anyang. To this end, the entire army should take resolute action to eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek diehard bandit armies that invade to seize wheat; (2) In offensive operations, it is necessary to do a good job of mass work, ensure that mass discipline is not violated, and carry out propaganda when going in and out, so that the masses can further understand that the People's Liberation Army is working for the people, and dispel the doubts of the masses about our army; (3) Launch a wide-ranging political offensive in the Chiang-occupied areas, publicize our Party and our army's policy on prisoners of war, mobilize the families of puppet soldiers to go to Anyang to demand the return of their husbands and sons, and massively disintegrate the Chiang bandit army; (4) All personnel of the logistics organs shall stop secondary work and fully help the masses in the驻地 with the wheat harvest for three days. The organs' livestock and carts will participate without compensation, and no rewards from the masses are allowed; (5) All departments shall stop all unnecessary errands and fully invest in the wheat harvest. (Du Ming)
