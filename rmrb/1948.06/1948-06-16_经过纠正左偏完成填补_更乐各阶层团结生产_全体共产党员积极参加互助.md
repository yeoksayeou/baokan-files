　　[Taihang News] After firmly correcting the errors of "leftist" adventurism, Gengle Village in the county completed land redistribution on March 25th. All landless and land-poor peasants had land to cultivate, wrongly struggled middle peasants received compensation, and landlords and old rich peasants were resettled. The enthusiasm for production among all classes has reached an unprecedented high. Poor peasant Jiang Shuangbang happily said, "Now that I have more land, I must produce well." Encouraged by his enthusiasm for production, he bought back an ox and worked hard from dawn till dusk. Poor peasant Si Laohan, who didn't work very well in the past, said happily after receiving land, "This year, I must work hard and not let the masses down. I won't waste a penny this year, and I plan to find a partner and start a family. I didn't have the motivation to work in the past, but now I must work hard." He has already finished sowing his land. Jiang Shihe, a middle peasant who was wrongly struggled, said, "I was wrongly struggled in the past, but now I have been compensated. The masses took good care of me and gave me grain and money, and also returned my house and donkey. I will produce well in the future and develop in two years." Lao Zhangsuo, another middle peasant who was wrongly struggled, said happily after receiving compensation, "I was wrongly struggled in the past, but today I am compensated. The policy is not to struggle against middle peasants, and if you struggle wrongly, you will be compensated. In the past, I was good at managing my family. As long as I work hard, I will definitely be able to prosper." The landlord Zhao Ziming's family of four was also assigned four shares of land and started a life of labor. After all the land was sown, they continuously chopped firewood to sell, earning more than one thousand yuan per load. At the same time, they repaired roads outside for more than ten days and earned more than eight thousand yuan. Many young women participated in agricultural production. In terms of sideline occupations, old women and young girls knitted straw hats. By the end of March in the lunar calendar, the whole village had knitted more than five thousand hats, averaging one thousand yuan per hat. Under the principle of voluntarism, the village organized sixty-three mutual aid teams, with more than eight hundred and seventy households participating. Special attention was paid to absorbing wrongly struggled middle peasants and providing them with assistance, implementing the unity of middle and poor peasants. After being organized, in addition to engaging in agricultural production, a portion of the labor force was spared to engage in sideline occupations and other activities. The village's eight cotton gins ginned eight hundred catties of cotton per day, earning more than four thousand eight hundred catties of rice in more than a month. According to the statistics of sixteen small mutual aid societies, they earned more than two million yuan in the past month by selling cloth, second-hand clothes, and mountain products. Because the mutual aid is fair and the sideline occupations are very profitable, the capital of some small mutual aid societies has developed to one million, and some to three or four hundred thousand, and they are still raising funds. Most of the money earned is used to buy more livestock and farm tools. In one month, twenty-seven middle and poor peasant households bought twenty-five livestock, and the whole village added more than three hundred farm tools. In order to further promote the masses' enthusiasm for production, the leadership, with the Peasant Association as the main body, absorbed experienced producers and organized village and neighborhood production committees to strengthen leadership. Loans were issued, especially taking care of wrongly struggled middle peasants and newly established poor peasant households. Among the six million yuan in loans, wrongly struggled middle peasants borrowed 70%, poor peasants borrowed 20%, and middle peasants borrowed 10%. The cooperative opened a blacksmith's shop, and four workers made and repaired farm tools for the masses every day. Recently, a large batch of "811" grain seeds was bought from outside and distributed and adjusted to households lacking seeds. At the same time, corvée labor was rectified, and the chaotic phenomenon of requiring the masses to cultivate land on behalf of the personnel of factories and shops was eliminated. The village saved one-half of the labor force in cultivating land on behalf of others compared to last year. Communist Party members actively participated in production mutual aid, and their role was particularly significant. Now, more than one hundred and eighty Party members have participated in production mutual aid.
