　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 16th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Qufu County, the hometown of Confucius, east of Ziyang on the Jinpu Railway on the night of the 11th. The results of the battle are still being tallied. On the same day, another unit of our army recovered Ningyang City, north of Ziyang, and the defending enemy fled. Before capturing Qufu, the People's Liberation Army specifically issued rules for entering the city, specifically stipulating that the troops attacking the city must protect Qufu's historical sites, protect the Confucius Temple, the Confucius Garden, and the Yan (Confucius's student Yan Hui) Temple, and cherish all statues, steles, dragon pillars, calligraphy, paintings, books, trees, artificial hills, and all other equipment within the temples and gardens.
