　　My Observations on Returning to My Village After Land Reform
    Hao Hairu
    My village (Changcheng Town, Zuoquan County) was a backward village in the past, with scattered and disunited people. Except for refugees from Shahe, Linxian, and Xingtai, no women knew how to spin or weave. Although there was an old water mill south of the village, it had long become useless because no one was responsible for repairing it. Even the good land near the houses was not planted well, and hillside land was out of the question. Before land reform, labor production mutual aid teams and village cooperatives were not organized despite repeated advocacy by the working staff. Out of the 105 households in the village, including five landlord and rich peasant families, there were more than 300 sheep, all of which were looted by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance! I thought that even though the Japanese invaders had surrendered, it would be difficult to restore sheep farming within three to five years. This time I returned to the village during the spring plowing and planting season, and I saw a large flock of more than 600 sheep being rotated to lie on the ground by the villagers. I thought it must be from another county or village, but when I asked the shepherd, I learned that it was bought by the emancipated peasants in the village last summer to accumulate fertilizer for production after organizing a small-scale sheep raising group. At that time, they only bought more than 150 sheep, but this spring they have bred more than 267, and together with the two villages of Dianshang and Daofogou, which are three to five miles away from my village, they have a total of more than 600 sheep. The damaged water mill has been funded by the village cooperative, and during the slack season in early spring last year, it took more than 800 workdays to repair it into a very good water mill. It is stipulated that it should first be used by households in debt, and when no one in the village or neighboring villages needs to use it, the village cooperative can use it, with low milling fees, which is convenient for the masses. By freeing up manpower and animal power from grinding with stone mills, the animals can be used for transportation, and women can take time to spin and weave. Because all the women in the village have learned to spin, and most have learned to weave, there are now 73 spinning wheels, 13 hand-pulled shuttle looms, and two native looms in the village. Not only can they produce enough for themselves, but they can also sell a small portion. In the past, there were few households and a lot of land in the village, so not only was the hillside land barren, but the flat land was also not planted well. Now, the 105 households have developed into 131 households (including 28 households from other places; in the past, they were exclusive, but now they do not distinguish regions and try their best to settle immigrants, so the development is very fast). The villagers have changed from being disunited to united, and human relations have changed from being mean to being honest. For example, Zuo Suohai, a villager, picked up a roll of luggage from the Yuci transportation team on the road south of the village last June, worth about 30,000 yuan. He immediately handed it over to the village office to find the owner. Soon the original owner came to claim it, and offered Zuo Suohai 2,000 yuan as a reward, but he refused to accept it. Recently, they have also made great efforts to respond to the leadership's call to correct left-leaning deviations, and have been as lenient as possible to landlords and rich peasants, helping them to sow seeds with their animal power, turning the animal power of landlords and rich peasants into manpower, and allowing them to participate in mass mutual aid teams. For example, although my family used to be a small landowner who was transformed from a rich peasant, I had served as the principal of a senior primary school and a model primary school for 13 years in the old society, as well as the manager of a public funds bureau, and the director of the Hebei Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Branch. I had a very strong feudal character. After reflecting on myself in the county in early April this year, when I returned to the village, I estimated that I was a feudal ruler in the old society. Although most villagers did not feel any ill will towards me, I was afraid that a few people could not understand me. Unexpectedly, these people remembered my father and son's ten years of revolution, offsetting my crimes with my merits, and not blaming me for the past. They lent me 1.2 dan of food and allocated more than five mu of good land to me to help me save myself through production, which was far beyond my expectations! This proves that the leadership and the masses can distinguish right from wrong and not wrong anyone. At the same time, I felt even more that the implementation of land reform can not only enable the broad masses to change from poor to rich, but also from disunity to unity, and from backwardness to progress, which made me feel grateful and happy. I have taken the time to write this down to tell those landlords and rich peasants in our liberated areas who have had their land confiscated that as long as we lower our heads politically, surrender our weapons economically, and stand with the masses honestly and faithfully, the masses will take care of us.

　　土改后我归村的观感
    郝海如
    我村（左权县长城镇）是过去的一个落后村，人心散涣，至不团结。妇女除沙河、林县、邢台逃来之难民外，无一会纺织的。村南虽有旧水磨一座，因无人负责修理，早已成了废物。门边上的好地还种的不成熟，岗坡地更谈不到。劳动生产互助组、村合作社在土改前，虽经工作人员一再提倡，都没有组织起来。全村百零五户人家，内有五家地主富农，共养羊三百余只，在抗战期间早已被日寇抢完了！我认为日寇虽然投降，三五年内很难恢复养羊事业。我此次返村，正值春耕下种，见有六百余只一大群羊给村人轮流卧地，我以为这一定是外县外村的，问讯牧羊人，乃知是村中翻身农民为了积肥生产，在去年夏天组织起小份养羊，买下太谷羊群的。当时只买了百五十余只，今春即孳生成二百六十七只，连距我村三五里的殿上、道佛沟两村，合伙为六百余只。破坏了的水磨已由村合作社出资，在去年春初农闲时花了八百多工，按劳力顶股，修理成一座很好的水磨，规定先尽花户磨，本村邻村无人磨时，再由村合作社磨，磨费从廉，群众感觉方便。誊下旱磨的人力、畜力，牲口可以出外运输，妇女可以抽空纺织。因为全村的妇女都学会纺，大部已学会织，现在全村共有纺花车七十三辆，手拉梭织布机十三架，土机两架，不惟纺织可以自给，还能出卖一小部分。过去村中户少地多，不仅坡地荒芜，平地种的也不成熟。今则由百零五户，发展成一百三十一户（外来户即有二十八家，过去排外，现在不分地区，对移民尽量安置，所以发展的很快），村人由不团结转向团结，人情由刻薄转向忠厚。例如村人左锁孩，去年六月在村南路上拾得榆次运输队行李一卷，约值洋三万元，当即交到村公所，招人认领，不久原失主找来，给左锁孩两千酬金不受。最近又竭力响应领导上纠正左倾偏向的号召，对地主、富农尽量宽大，有畜力的帮助地富下种，以畜力变地富的人力，让地富参加群众互助组。例如我家过去虽是一个由富农变成小经营地主，但本人在旧社会曾任过高小、模小校长十三年，公款局经理，河北烟酒事务分局长等职，封建性很大，本年四月初在县反省后，返村时，估计我是旧社会的一个封建统治者，虽大部村人对我没有恶感，恐怕有少数人对我不能谅解；不料这些人念我父子十年革命，以功抵罪，不咎既往，借给我一石二斗食粮，调剂给我五亩多较好的土地，帮助我生产自救，大大出乎我意料之外！由此可以证明，领导上与群众是能明辨是非、不冤枉一个人的。同时，更感觉实行土改，不仅能使广大群众由穷变富，还可以由不团结走向团结，由落后变为进步，使我不由得感激愉快。抽暇记之，以告请我解放区被算地富，只要我们在政治上低了头，经济上缴了械，忠诚老实的与群众站在一处，群众是会对我们加以照顾的。
