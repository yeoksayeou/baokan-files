Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. As the Finnish general election on July 1st draws near, the Finnish reactionaries, who hold a majority in the parliament, suddenly launched a frenzied attack on the Minister of the Interior, Communist Party member Leino, on the 19th, and passed a vote of no confidence in Leino by a vote of 81 to 61 (the Finnish parliament has a total of 200 seats). Finnish President Paasikivi then announced Leino's dismissal on the 22nd. Leino served as Minister of the Interior for three years. Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala told a delegation of workers on the 23rd: "Leino has completed all his tasks without error." Because Leino was in charge of the "Ministry of the Interior, which is crucial to the democratic development of Finland," he became a thorn in the side of the reactionaries. The reactionaries' attack on Leino aroused strong anger and widespread protests from the Finnish people. Dockworkers in the port of Helsinki first launched a demonstration strike on the 23rd. Soon after, the strike movement swept the country, and in some places 100% of the workers participated in the strike. On the 24th, a mass rally of 30,000 people was held in Helsinki. When Leino gave a speech, the crowd responded with enthusiastic cheers. In his speech, Leino thanked the people for their trust in him during his tenure as Minister of the Interior, and then pointed out: "We will not allow the position of Minister of the Interior to fall into the hands of the reactionaries." On the same day, a central steering committee was established in Helsinki to lead the protest against the reactionaries' offensive. The committee also issued a statement saying: "The reactionaries in our country have launched a frenzied attack on the new democratic line. The first victim of this attack was Leino, who was forced to step down. The next goal of the reactionaries is to drive the communists out of government institutions in order to restore the old regime in our country." The statement strongly stated: "This is intolerable to the democratic citizens of Finland. They have risen up across the country to defend the new democratic line and launched a strike movement to defeat the offensive of the reactionaries."

　　芬反动派向民主势力进攻
  　内长莱诺被迫免职
  　全国工人罢工抗议
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】当七月一日的芬兰大选日益临近之际，在国会占比较多数的芬兰反动派，突于十九日对内政部长共产党员采纳发动疯狂攻击，并以八十一票对六十一票通过对莱诺不信任票（按芬兰议会议员共二百席）。芬总统巴锡基维继于廿二日宣布莱诺免职。莱诺出任内长历时三年，芬总理皮可拉于廿三日告工人代表团称：“莱诺曾毫无错误地完成了他的一切任务”。由于莱诺掌管“对于芬兰民主发展至关重要的内政部”，他就成了反动派的眼中钉，反动派对莱诺的攻击，引起了全芬人民强烈的愤怒与普遍的抗议。赫尔辛基港码头工人，于廿三日首先发动示威罢工，不久以后，罢工运动即席卷全国，在某些地方百分之百的工人参加了罢工。廿四日赫尔辛基举行了三万人的群众大会，当由莱诺发表演说时，群众报以热烈的欢呼，莱诺在演说中感谢人民在他担任内长期间对他的信赖，继指出：“我们将不容许内长职位落到反动派手中。”同日芬京成立了领导抗议反动派进攻的中央指导委员会，该会并颁发文告称：“我国反动派已对新的民主路线发动了疯狂进攻，这个进攻的第一个受害者，是被迫去职的莱诺，反动派的下一目标是把共产党人驱出政府机构，以便在我国恢复旧政权。”文告力称：“这是芬兰的民主公民不能忍受的，他们已在全国各地起来捍卫新的民主路线，并发动了罢工运动以击败反动派的进攻。”
