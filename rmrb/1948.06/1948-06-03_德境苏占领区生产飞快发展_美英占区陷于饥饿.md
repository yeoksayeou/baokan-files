　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - TASS report: The economy in the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany is rapidly recovering. The industrial production index for the first quarter of the region shows it has exceeded the plan by 36 percent, an increase of 37 percent compared to the first quarter of last year. Among them, the light industry and building materials industry have recovered the fastest, exceeding the production quota by 160 percent in the previous quarter, and the latter exceeding it by 110 percent. The next fastest are the heavy industry sectors: machine manufacturing, exceeding the plan by 52.9 percent, electrical equipment exceeding it by 44.5 percent, iron and steel exceeding it by 41.1 percent, and the food industry also exceeding the plan by 16 percent. Due to the rapid recovery of various industrial production sectors, the railway and waterway transportation industries in the Soviet zone have also exceeded the shipping plan. For example, the volume of water transport in April exceeded 80,000 tons in 1945. In agriculture, agricultural areas that have been allocated land throughout the Soviet zone basically completed the sowing of grains and beans in April. As of April 24, the area sown exceeded more than double last year, an increase of 160,000 hectares compared to 1946.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - The economy of the American and British joint occupation zones in western Germany is suffering the calamity of the Marshall Plan. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Berlin on the 20th: The director of the American and British Import and Export Association admitted at a press conference that due to the disastrous consequences of the joint zone's food policy, the zone's responsibility to the United States for food alone has reached an alarming figure. It is claimed that in 1946 and 1947, the debt increased by $700 million annually. The plan to continue importing food in the next two years will increase the debt by another $700 to $800 million. According to an exclusive article by Wu Bulichi (one of the chairmen of the German People's Committee) published in the "German Review" in mid-May: According to the "plan" secretly formulated by the American military authorities in Frankfurt to implement the Marshall Plan, the deficit in West Germany's revenue and expenditure in 1948 will reach $1,246,128,000. The first part of the American "plan" reveals that the production volume of the American and British joint occupation zones last year only reached 39 percent of the 1936 level, while the steel industry only reached 28 percent. The plan stipulates that West Germany can earn $32 million from scrap iron exports in 1948. But at the same time, it must pay $60 million to the United States. Wu stated: Obviously, the meaning of the Marshall Plan is not to aid Germany, but to aid the United States. The United States wants to avoid its crisis by destroying Germany's national economy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - The people in the British and American occupation zones in West Germany continue their struggle against hunger. TASS reported: A general strike broke out in the city of Kassel in the American occupation zone on the 20th to protest the deteriorating food situation. The entire city came to a standstill, traffic stopped, and shops closed. Outraged residents held several protest rallies of up to 60,000 people, demanding the dismissal of Kassel, the official who created the famine. German trade union chairman Fotejin declared: The hunger and poverty of the German people have reached their peak. More than 80 professors and scientific workers in the province of Munich wrote to the director of the food administration of the American and British occupation zones, pointing out the serious situation caused by insufficient food for intellectual workers. The joint members of Munich University professors stated that the food rationing system of the West occupation zone authorities is "shameful."

　　德境苏占领区生产飞快发展
  　美英占区陷于饥饿
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社消息：德境苏占区经济正迅速恢复中。该区第一季工业生产指数显示，已超过计划百分之三十六，较去年第一季生产增加百分之三十七。其中以轻工业与建筑材料工业恢复最快，前季超过生产定额百分之一百六十，后者超过百分之一百一十。其次是重工业部门机器制造，超过计划百分之五十二点九，电气器材超过百分之四十四点五，而铁与钢超过百分之四十一点一，粮食工业亦超过计划百分之十六。由于各工业生产部门的迅速恢复，苏占区内的铁道及水路运输业，亦超过装运计划。例如四月份水运装运量超过一九四五年八万吨。在农业方面，苏占区各处分得土地的农业，已于四月份基本上完成了谷物与豆类的播种。从四月二十四日止，播种之面积超过去年两倍以上，较一九四六年增加十六万公顷。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】德国西部美英联合占领区的经济，正遭受着马歇尔计划的浩劫。据法新社柏林二十日电：美英进出口协会主任在记者会上承认：由于联合区粮食政策的恶果，该区仅在粮食上对美国的负责即达惊人数字。据称：在一九四六年与四七年，债务每年增加七亿美元。今后两年计划继续输入粮食，将使债务再增七亿至八亿美元。另据“德国评论”报于五月中旬发表的吴布利希（德人民委员会主席之一）专文所引：按照法兰克福美军当局所秘密制定以实行马歇尔计划的“计划”，则一九四八年西德收支不符之数将达十二亿四千六百十二万八千美元。该美国“计划”之第一部分，透露去年美英联合占领区的生产量仅达一九三六年水平的百分之三十九，而钢业则仅达百分之二十八。该计划规定西德于一九四八年废铁出口可收入三千二百万美元。但同时必须以六千万美元以支付美国。吴氏称：显然，马歇尔计划的意义并不是援助德国，而是援助美国，美国欲遂毁灭德国的国民经济来避免它的危机。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】西德英美占领区人民继续反饥饿斗争。塔斯社报导：美占区卡塞尔城于二十日发生总罢工，抗议粮食情况的恶劣，该城全部陷于静止状态，交通停顿，商店关门，激愤的居民曾举行数达六万人的抗议大会，要求撤换制造灾荒的官员卡塞尔。德国工会主席弗特金宣称：德国人民之饥饿与贫困已达顶点，慕尼黑省八十余位教授与科学工作者，曾致函美英占领区粮食管理局局长，指出脑力劳动者因粮食不足而引起的严重情况。慕尼黑大学教授联合会员称：西占区当局对他们的粮食配给制度，“令人感到羞辱”。
