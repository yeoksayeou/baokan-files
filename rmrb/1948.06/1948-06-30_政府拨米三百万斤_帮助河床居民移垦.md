[Ji Lu Yu News] The Yellow River's course changes unpredictably, and villages on the riverbed are often flooded. The Ji Lu Yu Administrative Office, in order to protect the safety of residents in these villages, has established a Riverbed Residents Relocation and Land Reclamation Committee, under the jurisdiction of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. This committee is responsible for relocation matters and has decided to allocate 3 million jin of millet to motivate residents of villages endangered by the river's currents to move to build new villages at Weinan Embankment in Hua County. The government will provide as much assistance as possible to resolve all expenses related to relocation, settling down, and land reclamation. The first batch will involve the relocation of 500 households, and after gaining experience, the project will continue on a larger scale. Currently, the committee's director, Liu Chizhai, deputy director, Xi Chaojiu, and others went to Weinan Embankment on the 20th to survey the wasteland and village conditions, and to discuss relocation preparations with the local government. Once preparations are complete, they will immediately go to the riverbed villages to mobilize relocation. Note: Weinan Embankment, also called Weinan Irrigation area, used to be a waterlogged area, stretching for dozens of miles with sparse villages and fertile land, making it a very good area for land reclamation.

　　政府拨米三百万斤
  　帮助河床居民移垦
    【冀鲁豫讯】黄河河势变化无常，河床村庄常遭淹陷，冀鲁豫行署为保护河床村庄居民的安全，特成立河床居民移垦委员会，隶属黄河水利委员会，负责移垦事宜，并决定将移垦小米三百万斤，动员河床中水势危及村庄的居民，搬至滑县卫南陂建筑新村。所有迁移、安家、垦植等费用，政府尽量帮助解决，第一批先动员五百户移垦，取得经验后，再继续大量进行。现该会主任刘尺斋、副主任郗超九等已于二十日赴卫南陂勘察荒地及村庄情况，和当地政府商讨移垦准备工作，一俟筹备就绪，立即赴河床村动员迁移。按：卫南陂也叫卫南灌，原来是个积水的地方，纵横数十里，村庄稀少，土地肥沃，是一片很好的垦植区。
