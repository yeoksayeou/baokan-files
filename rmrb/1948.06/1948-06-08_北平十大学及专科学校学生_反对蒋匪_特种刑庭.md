Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Students from ten universities and colleges in Beiping, including Tsinghua and Peking University, are resisting Chiang Kai-shek's persecution and demanding the immediate abolition of the so-called "Special Criminal Tribunal" established by Chiang Kai-shek bandits to persecute patriotic students and all patriotic democrats. According to various reports: The Beiping Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Garrison Headquarters arrested more than ten students from Yu Hua, Hui Wen, and other middle schools in mid-April, falsely accusing these young students of organizing a so-called "Alliance Assassination Group" and planning to send them to the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's "Beiping Higher Special Criminal Court" for trial. Students from ten universities and colleges, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and jointly telegraphed the Chiang government's Judicial Yuan at the end of May, demanding the immediate abolition of this fascist institution that had long been hated by the people. According to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Organization and Trial Regulations of the Special Criminal Tribunal," which was passed by the puppet government on February 25 this year, it has now been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Wuhan, Xi'an, and other places. Anyone deemed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to have opposed their traitorous and dictatorial acts will be arrested and sent to this type of court for criminal trial. The "fascist special nature of this court lies in the fact that the court can arbitrarily impose severe punishments on the victims," and those being tried "may not appeal or protest." Sentences of more than five years' imprisonment can only "apply for a retrial by the Special Criminal Tribunal," and it is stipulated that even if the judgment is "considered to have a major error," "if it exceeds twenty days, a retrial may not be requested."

　　北平十大学及专科学校学生
  　反对蒋匪“特种刑庭”
    【新华社陕北五日电】北平清华、北京等十所大学及专科学校学生，反抗蒋匪迫害，要求立即撤销蒋匪为迫害爱国学生及一切爱国民主人士而设的所谓“特种刑事法庭”。据各方报导：北平蒋匪警备司令部于四月中旬逮捕育华、汇文等中学学生十余名，诬指此等年轻学生组织所谓“同盟暗杀团”，拟即解往蒋匪“北平高等特种刑事法庭”审讯。北京、清华等十所大学及专科学生闻讯，愤慨异常，于五月底联合致电蒋政府司法院，要求立即撤销此一早为人民所痛恨的法西斯机构。按蒋匪“特种刑事法庭组织及审判条例”，系伪政府本年二月二十五日通过，目前已在宁、沪、平、汉、西安等地设立。凡被蒋匪认为有反对其卖国独裁行为者，即逮捕送往该种法庭刑审。该“法庭之法西斯特种性质，在于法庭对被害者可任意从重处断”，被审者并“不得上诉或抗告”，五年徒刑以上之判决，亦只能“声请特种刑事法庭复判”，并规定即令判决“认为有重大错误者”，“但逾期二十日，即不得声请再审”。
