Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - According to Chongqing dispatches in Shanghai's "Economic Weekly": Chongqing, the industrial center of the interior, is now facing a complete dead end. During the war, the industry in the area accounted for more than a quarter of the industry in the interior. According to official statistics at the end of 1945, a total of 1,694 factories were registered in Chongqing. However, by October of last year, the Chongqing Industrial Association had only 345 member factories registered (including factories relocated to Sichuan), and only two-thirds of them were fully operational. The rest were in a state of semi-suspension. The number of large and small coal mines in the Jialing River area was 130 during the war, but they successively stopped work after the victory. Although 110 of them resumed work afterwards, 20 more closed down last year. Nine soap factories closed down last year, two electrical equipment industries stopped operations, and four of the eighteen flour mills were suspended last year. The cigarette industry was even more miserable, with half of the 60 factories suspending operations. Of the twelve alcohol industries, six were intermittent. Rubber factories are also reducing production. Due to the severe financial difficulties caused by Chiang Kai-shek bandits' rampant issuance of currency, and the general raw material panic and lack of equipment caused by the bureaucratic capital monopoly, the national industry in the storm is continuing to be driven towards complete destruction.

　　重庆千六百工厂倒闭了五分之四
    【新华社陕北卅一日电】据上海“经济周报”报载重庆通讯：内地工业中心的重庆，现已全部面临死亡的绝境。战时该地工业约占内地工业的四分之一以上，据三十四年底官方统计，重庆工厂登记的累进数共一六九四家，但至去年十月重庆工业协会登记的会员厂家（包括迁川工厂）已经有三四五家，且其中全部开工的只有三分之二，其余均在半停顿状态中。嘉陵江区的大小煤矿在战时有一百三十家，胜利后即相继停工，其后虽曾复工至一百一十家，但去年又有二十家关门。肥皂厂去年有九家歇业，电工器材工业停业二家，十八家面粉厂去年有四家在停顿中，卷烟工业更惨，六十余家中有一半在停工。酒精工业十二家，则在时断时续中六家，橡胶厂也都在减产中。由于蒋匪滥发通货造成的严重的资金困难以及因官僚资本垄断统治所引起的普遍原料恐慌和装备的缺乏，正继续加速驱迫风雨飘摇中的民族工业正走向全部毁灭。
