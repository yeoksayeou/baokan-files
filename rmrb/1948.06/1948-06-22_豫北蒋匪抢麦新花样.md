The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in northern Henan are desperately struggling to survive and are frantically seizing wheat with ever-changing tricks in the past twenty days from late May to early June.

As the wheat harvest began, just as our border area's military and civilians were fully engaged in harvesting and actively launching the first stage of the wheat protection struggle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with a reconnaissance-like posture, combined with some fleeing traitors and despots, frequently entered and exited our border area in small groups, supplemented by large-scale incursions, attempting to lay the foundation for a "large-scale wheat grab." According to incomplete statistics from six counties including Bo'ai, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Xinxiang, Huixian, and Anyang, in the half-month from the 27th of last month to the 10th of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched more than 110 intrusions of dozens or more people, of which large-scale incursions of 500 or more people accounted for a very small number. At this time, the purpose of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' intrusions was not to seize wheat on a large scale, but on the one hand to carry out absurd deceptive propaganda, releasing the smoke screen of "not leaving a single grain," attempting to paralyze the vigilance of the masses, and on the other hand, attempting to intrude with large forces to prepare to set up temporary strongholds and expand the wheat-grabbing area. For example, the enemy in Wuzhi and Jiaozuo frequently appeared, and wherever they went, they carried out deceptive propaganda, saying "We are here to protect the people in harvesting wheat," combined with armed threats, attempting to expand their maintenance area. Wang Ziquan, the bandit leader in Anyang, also personally intruded into the villages along our border, coercing the masses to hold meetings and carry out deceptive propaganda. The enemy in Jiaozuo launched a large-scale attack on the 3rd of this month, attempting to establish temporary wheat-grabbing strongholds in Xin'an Town and other places, in preparation for a large-scale robbery, but these conspiracies have been successively shattered by our military and civilians' heroic and active attacks.

At the beginning of this month, the new wheat came on the market, and the wheat protection struggle quickly turned to the second stage of harvesting, threshing, and storing. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits changed their tactics from mainly small-scale intrusions to concentrating larger forces, adopting large encirclements, using rapid night actions, not taking the main roads, and concentrating in groups on one place for a sudden attack. Sometimes they also coordinated with a small number of cavalry to break through, and after reaching the destination, they expanded from point to area, seizing wheat on a large scale, carrying out devastating looting such as robbery, killing, burning, and raping women. On the 3rd of this month, the 40th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jiaozuo gathered more than 3,000 local bandits and others and launched a joint attack on six villages including Qiao District and Beiguanzhuang in the third district of Wuzhi, adopting the above-mentioned tactics. After reaching the destination, they quickly dismantled doors and destroyed houses to build temporary fortifications. In Qiaowan Village alone, they stationed and robbed for two or three days, building eighteen temporary bunkers. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, the 317th Regiment of the 40th Division of the enemy in Xinxiang and Huixian, combined with local bandits, coordinated with more than 20 cavalrymen, and launched a large-scale intrusion into the Yuhe area of our sixth district. Wherever they went, the regular army concentrated on rest, and the local security regiment, the Returning Home Corps, and the puppet township government carried out large-scale wheat grabbing and conscription in the surrounding villages, and coerced and suppressed a large number of people in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas to rob, creating a new red-white antagonism. The fleeing landlords also took the opportunity to settle old scores, and also used kidnapping and extortion methods. After stationing and robbing in six villages including Qiaowan in Wuzhi for three days, they robbed more than 1,300 large stones of wheat. After robbing in Zhaogu, Yuhe and other areas of our sixth district of Huixian for two days, they captured more than 700 young adults, and robbed more than 300 livestock in Yangou and other five villages, claiming that each livestock could be redeemed with seven stones of wheat, and burned those they could not rob on a large scale. On May 27th, the 40th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, in coordination with nearly a thousand local bandits, attacked the Zuozhuang area of the second district of Jixian. Because they were tracked and pursued by our local armed forces and militia, they fled to Zuozhuang and burned more than 480 mu of wheat. More than 50 of the 60 households in the village were looted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Before fleeing, the division deliberately turned from brutal terror to a threatening and deceptive policy of appeasement, saying "As long as you hand over grain and money, you are one family," attempting to spread the seeds of "maintenance." But this self-deceiving method completely exposed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' despicable and viciousness. Now the wheat harvest in northern Henan has passed, and a more intense struggle to store wheat and protect grain has begun. The military and civilians in our border area are further urgently mobilized to resolutely give a fatal blow to the new tricks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　豫北蒋匪抢麦新花样
    五月下旬至六月上旬二十天来，豫北蒋伪苟延残喘，垂死挣扎，疯狂进行抢麦，活动花样百出。
    麦收开始，正当我边地军民全力抢收，积极主动展开第一阶段的护麦斗争时，蒋伪便以侦察性的姿态，结合一些逃亡奸霸，以小股向我边地频繁出入，并辅以大规模的进犯，企图打下“大抢麦”的基础。仅据博爱、修武、武陟、新乡、辉县、安阳等六县不完全统计，从上月二十七至本月十日半月内，蒋匪为数十人以上的出扰即达一百一十多次，其中五百人以上的大规模出犯占极少数，这时候蒋匪出犯的目的不在于大肆动手抢麦，而是一方面进行荒诞欺骗宣传，放出“不遗嬲”的烟幕，企图麻痹群众的警惕，一方面企图以大股兵力出犯，准备安扎临时据点，扩大莫抢粮区，如武陟、焦作等地敌人屡次出没，每到一地即进行欺骗宣传，说“我们是来保护老百姓收麦”，结合武装威胁，企图扩大其维持区。安阳匪首王自全亦亲自出犯我边沿村，胁迫群众召开大会，进行欺骗宣传。焦作敌人曾在本月三号大举出动，企图在辛安镇等地建立临时抢麦据点，为大抢劫作准备，但是这些阴谋，在我军民英勇主动出击下，已陆续粉碎了。
    本月初新麦登场，护麦斗争迅速转上了收、打、藏的第二阶段，这时蒋匪改变了小股出入为主的战术，集中较大兵力，采取大包围，利用夜间迅速行动，不走大路，分股向一地集中猛扑。有时还配合少数骑兵突进，到达目的地后，由点向面扩展，大规模抢麦，施行抢、杀、烧、奸淫妇女等毁灭性的洗劫。本月三日，焦作蒋匪四十师纠集土顽等共三千余，向我武陟三区桥区、北官庄等六村合击，采用上述战术，到达目的地后，便迅速卸门毁房，构筑临时工事，在桥湾一村驻抢两三日，即筑了十八个临时碉堡。本月一、二两日新（乡）辉（县）之敌四十师三一七团，结合土顽，配合二十多名骑兵，大规模进犯我六区峪河一带，每到一地，正规军集中休息，土顽保安团、还乡团、伪乡公所等在周围村大肆抢麦抓丁，并胁迫镇压大批蒋占区群众乱抢，制造新的赤白对立，逃亡地主亦乘机进行倒算，同时并使用绑票勒索办法。在武陟桥湾等六村驻抢三天，抢走麦子一千三百多大石，在我辉县六区赵固、峪河一带大抢两天，抓走青壮年七百多人，在淹沟等五村抢走牲口三百来头，扬言每头牲口可拿七石麦子去赎，抢不走的便大举焚烧。五月二十七日蒋匪四十师配合土顽近千，犯我汲县二区左庄一带，因遭我地方武装与民兵跟踪追击，窜至左庄，即烧毁麦子四百八十多亩。该村六十多户，就有五十多户遭受蒋匪洗劫，该师临逃窜前，又故意由残暴恐怖突然转为威胁诱骗的怀柔政策，说“只要交粮交款，就是一家人”，妄图传播“维持”种子。但这种盗铃掩耳的办法，正彻底暴露了蒋匪的卑鄙毒辣。现豫北麦收已过，更剧烈的藏麦护粮斗争已经展开，我边区军民正进一步紧急动员起来，针对蒋伪活动的新花样，坚决给予致命打击。
