Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th—Over a hundred students of the Northwest People's Liberation Army Officer Training Corps arrived in Yan'an on the 10th of this month. Most of these students were liberated in April by our army during the Changning Town battle in Yongshou County during the Jingwei Campaign. They originally belonged to the Kuomintang army's Youth Army 203rd Division and were mostly junior and senior high school students, the majority being from Sichuan. Wang Weidan, Deputy Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Command, Li Zhuoran, Director of the Joint Political Department, Jiang Longji, Deputy Director of the Border Region Government's Education Department, and others, personally visited the team and gave speeches, elaborating on our policy of uniting the broad masses of people and intellectuals in the KMT-controlled areas to jointly build a New Democratic China. They were encouraged to study hard, transform their thinking, and serve the people. Currently, in addition to providing them with clothing, shoes, and distributing books and newspapers, our army has also held opera evenings for them. They are enjoying their lives and studies very much, and after dinner every day, they often play basketball games with nearby organizations.

    【新华社西北二十八日电】西北解放军官教导团学员一百余人，已于本月十日抵达延安。该部学员大部为四月我军在泾渭战役永寿县常宁镇战斗中所解放，原属蒋军青年军二○三师，多系初高中青年学生，以四川人最多。陕甘宁晋绥联防司令部副司令员王维丹、联政政治部主任李卓然、边府教育厅副厅长江隆基等曾先后亲临该队讲话，阐释我团结蒋区广大人民和知识分子共同建设新民主主义新中国的政策，勉励他们努力学习，改造思想，为人民服务。现我军除给他们补充被服、鞋子、发给书报外，并为他们举行歌剧晚会，他们的生活学习都很愉快，每日晚饭后常与临近机关作篮球比赛。
