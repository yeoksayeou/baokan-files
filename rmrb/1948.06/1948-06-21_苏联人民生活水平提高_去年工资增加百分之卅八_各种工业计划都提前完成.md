Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Just as the working people of capitalist countries are trapped in the abyss of hunger, the living standards of the Soviet working people are rapidly improving. Last year, the wages and salaries of Soviet workers and staff increased by 23% compared to the previous year (and continue to rise this year). If we add bonuses, sickness benefits, free medical care, free education, full pay for annual vacations, full pay for maternity leave for female workers, childcare subsidies, and relief funds for large families, the actual average wage increase for workers and staff last year was 38%. The abundant life of the Soviet working people can be illustrated by the example of the life of a worker's family. Koloyatev was an apprentice at the "Red Proletarian" machine-building factory in Moscow eighteen years ago. After being educated and becoming a lathe operator, he entered the factory's attached technical school for a year. Later, he received education for two and a half years in a foreman training class and became a foreman. During his education, everything was free. While studying in the foreman training class, he did not have to work and still received his regular salary. During his work, he routinely went to sanatoriums in the Caucasus, Crimea, and other places for his annual vacation, and the factory provided vacation pay and travel expenses. His wife and two children also enjoy free medical care. The children all attend school for free. His current residence has telephone, gas, and electricity, costing him only 5% or 6% of his salary.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS reports: News continues to pour in from all over the Soviet Union about various industries completing and exceeding their production plans for the first half of the year. As of the 12th of this month, all industries in the Latvian Republic have completed their plans for the first half of the year, with a 21% increase in production compared to the same period last year. The republic's industrial production had already exceeded the pre-war level by 27% by the end of April this year. Seven hundred factories in Moscow, all factories in the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region, several factories in Tashkent, the food industry in Moldova, and the meat and dairy industry in Crimea have all completed their plans for the first half of the year and have begun production for the second half of the year. The labor productivity of Soviet workers is greatly exceeding the planned level, while production costs are being significantly reduced. The Ural steel factory, which completed its six-month plan on June 2nd, had already exceeded the average daily output originally scheduled for 1950 before May Day. The dockworkers of Kiev, who completed their plan for the first half of the year in early June, have exceeded the cargo handling volume of the first half of last year by 200%. In early June, the output of Moldova's food industry exceeded the output of the first half of last year by 250%. Although the metallurgical factories in the Dnieper River region have not installed new blast furnaces, their milled iron production in the first five months of this year increased by 50% compared to the same period last year. Due to reduced production costs, the Dnieper River region saved 20 million rubles in the first quarter's budget this year. A Pravda editorial, in discussing this issue, emphasized: "One of the characteristics of this year's socialist competition is the movement to reduce production costs and improve the efficiency of factories. This is a prerequisite for accelerating socialist accumulation and further improving the material welfare of the socialist state."

　　苏联人民生活水平提高
    去年工资增加百分之卅八
  　各种工业计划都提前完成
    【新华社陕北十七日电】正当资本主义各国劳动人民被陷在饥饿深渊之时，苏联劳动人民的生活水平则在迅速提高。去年苏联职工的工资与薪水，较前年已增加百分之二十三（今年继续增高）。如加上红利、疾病救济、免费医疗、免费教育、每年假期工资照付、女工产前产后假期工资照付、子女保育费津贴、人口众多的家庭救济费等项，则去年职工的实际工资平均增加了百分之三十八。苏联劳动人民的丰足生活，可用一家工人的生活实例来说明。科洛雅捷夫十八年前是莫斯科“红色无产者”机器制造厂的一个学徒，受教育成为旋盘工人后，又进了工厂附设的技术学校学习一年，后来又在领班训练班受教育两年半，成为领班。在受教育期间，一切都是免费的。在领班训练班学习时，不必工作仍照常领到工资。在工作期间，他照例经常到高加索、克里米亚等休养所渡他的每年假期，并由厂方发给休养费和旅费。他的妻子和两个小孩，也享受免费医疗。小孩都是免费入学。他家现在的住宅，有电话、瓦斯、电气的装置，只花费他工资的百分之五或六。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社报导：全苏各地继续传来各种工业完成并超过前半年生产计划的消息。截至本月十二日止，拉脱维亚共和国全部工业已完成前半年计划，较去年同一时期的生产量增加了百分之廿一。该共和国工业生产在今年四月份终了时，即已超过战前水平百分之二十七。莫斯科市的七百家工厂，莫斯科州卡尔斯诺哥尔斯克区的全部工厂，塔什干的若干工厂，摩达维亚的食品工业与克里米亚的肉乳工业，都已完成了上半年的计划，并开始生产下半年的定额。苏联工人的劳动生产率正在大量超过原定计划的水平，而生产成本则在大量减低中。六月二日完成半年计划的乌拉尔地方的钢铁工厂，在五一节前夕即超过原定于一九五○年到达的每日平均产量。六月初完成前半年计划的基辅码头工人，其装卸货物的总量已超过去年前半年货物装卸量的百分之二百。六月初，摩达维亚的食品工业产量，已超过去年上半年产量的百分之二百五十。德聂伯河流域的冶金工厂，虽然并没有装置新的鼓风炉，但今年前五个月的铣铁生产却比去年同一时期增加了百分之五十。由于减少了生产成本，德聂伯河流域节省了今年第一季的预算达二千万卢布。真理报社论在论及此一问题时着重指出：“今年社会主义竞赛的特点之一，是争取减低生产成本与提高各工厂效率的运动。这是日益加速社会主义积蓄和进一步提高社会主义国家物质福利的先决条件。”
