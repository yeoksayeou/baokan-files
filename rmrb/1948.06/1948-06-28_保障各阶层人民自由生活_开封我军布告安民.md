All officials of the Kuomintang provincial, county, and municipal government organs, police, and all personnel in the economic and cultural organs belonging to the Kuomintang government should obey the orders of this Headquarters, work normally with peace of mind, and be responsible for protecting all materials and documents of their respective organs, awaiting disposal, and must not hide or destroy them.

It is strictly forbidden to demolish, destroy, move, or steal them. If anyone deliberately violates this, anyone has the right to stop and arrest them, and hand them over to this Headquarters for punishment according to law.

(4) All foreign nationals residing in the city will be similarly protected by this Headquarters, provided they abide by democratic laws and regulations.
