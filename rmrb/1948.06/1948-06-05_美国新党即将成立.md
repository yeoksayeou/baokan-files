Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. New York dispatch: The "National Committee for Wallace for President," issued a notice on the 28th of last month, requesting all branches to send representatives to the first national congress of the new party to be held in Philadelphia from July 23rd to 25th to formally establish the new party, adopt a political program, and nominate Wallace and Taylor as the new party's candidates for president and vice president. The notice once again severely condemned the so-called "two-party policy," believing that it had undermined the United Nations in foreign affairs, and was attempting to use the conscription law and universal military training law to turn the United States into a militarist country in domestic affairs. According to the committee's notice, this is an implementation of its resolution of April 12th.

　　美国新党即将成立
    【新华社陕北二日电】纽约讯：“拥护华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”，于上月二十八日发出通告，要求各分会选派代表出席七月二十三至廿五日在费城举行之新党第一次全国代表大会，以正式成立新党，通过政纲及提名华莱士与泰勒为新党的总统及副总统候选人。该通告再次对所谓“两党政策”严词痛斥，认为它在外交方面破坏了联合国，在内政方面则正图利用征兵法与普遍军训法，使美国变为军国主义的国家。按该委员会此项通告，乃系执行其四月十二日的决议。
