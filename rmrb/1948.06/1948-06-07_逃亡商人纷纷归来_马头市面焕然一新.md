　　Fugitive Merchants Return One After Another
  　Matou Market Takes on a New Look
    [Chengci News] Matou Town, in the fifth district of Chengci, has very convenient transportation, with the Fu River by waterway and the railway by land. In the past, it was very prosperous. During the mass movement, the leadership made mistakes and did not protect industry and commerce, but instead struggled against whoever was rich. Of the town's 700 households, more than 400 were engaged in industry and commerce, and dozens of the larger ones were struggled against. For example, Zhang Nanlin's sugar workshop employed a long-term worker, had a family of four (plus two relatives living with him), and had 19 rooms. They struggled against him by calculating each room as one mu of land, and all the sugar workshop's furniture was confiscated. Wang Yuzhen's pharmacy was struggled against because he was said to be hoarding guns for traitors, and he was confiscated. In particular, Zhonghe Company (general store), whose manager, surnamed Lin, came from Nangong with only a basket and a pole. Without Matou Town, people would not have done business here. The masses all said, "Zhonghe came before Matou." When struggling against Zhonghe, the masses disagreed, but a few people suggested, "His business is substantial, and he has been doing it for a long time, worth several million yuan." In this way, his family was forced to struggle against. Due to this chaotic struggle, merchants were very panicked. In particular, after Zhonghe Company was sealed off, more than 40 merchants left in three days, and the prosperous Matou Town became more and more desolate. At that time, the leading comrades, seeing that this would continue and everyone would be gone in a few days, used a method of "changing the deity but not the temple," still calling the original merchants to operate, but in essence, it was considered the property of the peasant association. However, merchants still generally had concerns, and fear of struggle still existed severely. Even if they were in business, it was only to cope with the storefront. After the policy on industry and commerce came down, the leadership decided to implement it conscientiously. First, they understood and cleared up the masses' thinking, and all the wrongly struggled industrial and commercial enterprises that had not been distributed were returned in full. Those that had been distributed were being studied for resolution. The returned enterprises included Zhonghe, Taihe, Zhang Nanlin's sugar workshop, Fuyuan Yong pickle garden, Wang Yuzhen's pharmacy, Zhang Yonglu's general store, and eight others. When convening a general meeting of merchants to announce the return of industrial and commercial enterprises, they explained the policy on industry and commerce, and the merchants were relieved. More than 40 merchants who had fled also returned one after another and began business. Zhang Yonglu, a native of Nangong, was dejected and walked home after being struggled against. On the way, he heard that industrial and commercial enterprises were being returned, so he came back again and has now started business. As a result, goods that had previously been hidden from view have all been put on display, and the streets are regularly swept clean. After this, the government provided loans of 15.5 million yuan to support some industrial and commercial enterprises and also solved the difficulties of some small handicraftsmen. Now merchants are vying to find storefronts to do business, and not a single storefront is idle in the entire Matou. In this situation, merchants are asking to establish a bank. In order to develop industry and commerce and prosper the market (because this is the commercial center of our county), the government extracted 7 million yuan to establish a credit cooperative, which now uses 3 million yuan every day. The market now has a completely new look, and there are often 70 or 80 boats docked in the river. (You Ran, Shu Yun, Lao Qin)

　　逃亡商人纷纷归来
  　马头市面焕然一新
    【成磁消息】成磁五区马头镇，水路有滏河，陆路靠铁路，交通非常便利，过去很是繁华，群众运动时，领导上犯错误，对待工商业不是保护，而是谁富斗谁。全镇七百来户人家，有四百多户工商业，拣大的斗了数十家。例如张南林的糖坊，他做糖用了一个长工，他家人四口（还有亲戚二人在他家住），有十九间房，每间房按一亩地，就这样把人家斗啦，糖坊家具等都全部没收。王玉珍的药房，斗他时说他存着汉奸枪，把他没收啦。特别是中和号（杂货铺），掌柜姓林，是南宫人，来时是一筐一担子来的，没有马头镇，人家在这里就做买卖，群众都说：“先有中和，后有马头。”在斗中和时，群众不同意，但是少数人提出：“他这个买卖深实，干的年代长，值好几百万元。”就这样把他家硬斗啦。由于这样乱斗，商人表现非常恐慌，特别是封了中和号的门，商人三天里边就走了四十多家，繁华的马头镇，一天比一天萧条起来。当时领导同志，看到这样下去，几天就走完啦，遂用了个换神不换庙的办法，还叫原先的商人经营，实质算农会里的东西，但是这样商人还普遍存在着顾虑，怕斗思想还严重的存在着，即便营业着也是支应门市。工商业政策下来后，领导上决定认真执行，首先即了解打通群众思想，将错斗的工商业未分者一律全数退还，已分者正在研究解决。计退回的有中和，太和，张南林的糖坊，复源涌酱菜园，王玉珍的药房，张永禄的杂货铺等八家。在召开全体商人大会宣布退还工商业时，向他们讲明工商业政策，商人都放心啦。逃亡的四十多家商人，也都陆续回来，开始营业。张永禄是南宫人，把他斗后，他垂头丧气的往家走，走到半路，听说退回工商业，就又回来啦，现在已开始营业。经过这样，从前的不见天的货物，都已摆了出来，大街上经常扫的干干净净，又经过这次政府贷款一千五百五十万元，扶持了一些工商业，并又解决一部小手工业者的困难。现在商人都争着找门面做买卖，整个马头，没有一个门面闲着。在这种情况下，商人要求成立银行，政府为了发展工商业繁荣市场（因这是我县商业中心），抽出七百万元，成立了个信用合作社，现每天使三百万元。市面现在焕然一新，河里经常停着七八十只船。（尤然、书运、老秦）
