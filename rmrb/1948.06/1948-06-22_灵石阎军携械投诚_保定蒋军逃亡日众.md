(Taiyue News) After our army liberated Linfen, the Yama bandits in Lingshi were extremely panicked. We took advantage of the situation to launch a mass political offensive to win over and disintegrate the puppet and die-hard personnel. In the past half month, 53 people have surrendered to us, bringing with them one small cannon, one machine gun, and 20 rifles and pistols. The Shuiyu "Self-Defense Corps," after seeing our leaflets, collectively surrendered to us with sixteen people. When Wen Gou Xiao of Yan'an Village surrendered, he brought two more people and four guns. The democratic government rewarded him with 100 jin of millet and made good arrangements for them to return home to produce.

(Jizhong News) KMT bandits in Baoding and other places are deserting in increasing numbers. From April to May 25, incomplete statistics show that 145 soldiers of the KMT bandit New 2nd Army in Baoding have fled to the liberated areas. Most of those who fled were old people who were captured and deceived by the KMT bandits, as well as merchants and coolies from the cities in the KMT-controlled areas. After fleeing, they all complained, saying, "We can't get enough to eat every day. Soldiers who have been in the army for three or four months haven't been issued guns yet. Old soldiers follow us with guns even when we go to the toilet. We have to report even to go out of the house, or else we'll get slapped." In a certain district of Xiongxian County, in May alone, 55 puppet soldiers, puppet organization personnel, and ten fugitive households fled from the KMT-controlled area. The puppet self-defense captain of a certain village and the puppet intelligence agent of a certain village automatically registered with the democratic government. A KMT soldier who fled from Jinghai City said, "The soldiers are divided into groups of three to monitor each other. If one person runs away, the other two are implicated. During battles, if one person retreats, the other two get beaten. KMT squad leader Wen Bingsheng, from Hunan, received a letter from home saying his mother was dying. He asked for leave, but not only was it not approved, but he was also beaten, and they said he was a troublemaker. But no one listens to him. As soon as they have a chance, they run to the liberated area." These KMT soldiers who have fled have all been treated with courtesy by our side. Those who wish to return home are given travel expenses and shoes, and a pass is issued to escort them home.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 19th: Yang Shaowu, Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader of the Second Reconnaissance Platoon of the 549th Regiment of the 183rd Brigade of the KMT 58th Division, led a squad leader and six soldiers, carrying one light machine gun and three rifles, and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army on the first of this month before the brigade was annihilated. When the brigade was surrounded, Yang Shaowu predicted that it would be annihilated and decided to surrender. After Yang and others detoured into our army's rear, they were received and commended by a certain regimental commander.

　　灵石阎军携械投诚
    保定蒋军逃亡日众
    【太岳讯】我军解放临汾后，灵石阎匪非常恐慌，我乘势展开群众性的政治攻势，争取瓦解伪顽人员。半月来已有五十三人向我投诚。计带来小炮一门机枪一挺，长短枪二十支。水峪“自卫团”看到我们的传单后，十六个人集体向我投降，延安村温狗小投诚时又带了两个人，四支枪，民主政府奖他小米一百斤，并很好安置他们回家生产。
    【冀中讯】保定等地蒋匪逃亡日益增多。保定蒋匪新二军，自四月到五月二十五日不完全统计，逃来解放区的已有一百四十五名，逃出者多是被蒋匪抓骗去的老百姓和蒋区城市的商贩及苦力。逃出后，他们都纷纷诉苦说：“我们每天吃不饱，三、四个月的兵还不给发枪，大小便都有老兵提枪跟着，出屋子门都要报告，要不就得挨耳光子。”雄县某区五月份里就有五十五名伪军伪组织人员及十户逃亡户从蒋区逃来，某村伪自卫队长和某村伪情报员自动向民主政府登记。从静海城逃出来的蒋匪士兵说：“当兵的每三个人组成一小组互助监视，一人逃跑两人受连累。打仗时一人后退两人挨打。蒋军班长文炳生，湖南人，家里来信说他娘快死了，他去请假，不但没准，倒挨了顿打，说他是捣乱分子。可是谁也不听他那一套，一有机会就向解放区跑。”这些逃来的蒋军都受到我方优待，愿回家的要发路费鞋子，并开路条，护送到家。
    【新华社中原前线十九日电】蒋军五十八师一八三旅五四九团搜索第二排少尉排长杨绍武，率班长一名，士兵六名，携轻机枪一挺，步枪三支，于本月一日该旅被歼之前，向解放军投诚。当该旅被包围时，杨绍武预料一定会被歼，就决意投诚。杨等绕道进入我军后方后，得到了某团长的赐见嘉奖。
