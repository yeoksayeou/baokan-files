　　Xingtai Maidiawan Party Members and Cadres
  　Actively Lead Mutual Aid in Weeding Seedlings

    [Taihang News] Party members and cadres in Maidiawan Village, Seventh District of Xingtai, attended the district-wide cadre meeting on April 15th (lunar calendar), understood the Party rectification policy, and put down their ideological burdens. Work immediately gained momentum. On the evening of the 3rd day of the fifth lunar month, Shen Huaizhen, chairman of the farmers' association, convened a meeting of the leaders of the village's six mutual aid groups. He first reviewed his previous "lying down" and the mistake of not leading production. Labor hero Shen Huaizhu also said: "This meeting should have been held earlier. If our thinking had been cleared earlier, why didn't we lead the masses in production? In the future, we must take the lead and be a good hired hand for the masses." Then the group leaders reported on the production situation: sowing had been completed, wheat had been harvested, and the immediate need was to weed seedlings. At this time, someone suggested speeding up the work and freeing up labor to do some short-term work. The chairman of the farmers' association said: If you want to sell your labor, each group must make a plan, seize the time, and make a concentrated effort to weed the seedlings, so as to ensure that no land is left uncultivated before going to sell your labor. The next night, under the leadership of the cadres and group leaders, each group formulated a short-term weeding plan. When the fourth group, under the leadership of the deputy village chief and director of the armed forces committee, formulated its plan, it first reviewed the shortcomings of last year's weeding: (1) The plots of land were scattered and fragmented, and seven or eight plots were weeded in half a day, which wasted time. (2) All the labor in the group was on the ground without division of labor. (3) There were too many people, and accounting was a bit troublesome. (4) Some people did not pay attention to quality when weeding, such as half-labor also took two rows, which was not as good as others, and wanted to earn full pay, so naturally they weeded poorly, and the land became uncultivated again in a few days. Then the methods for weeding this year were discussed: the 18 people in the group voluntarily formed four small groups. Truly implement piece rate work. Advocate meticulous work, and before the 15th day of the fifth lunar month, small seedlings should be weeded in the paddy fields, and the dry land should be weeded twice, the cotton should be weeded three times, and even the sloping land should be weeded within ten days. Regarding the issue of short-term work, a heated debate unfolded. Finally, everyone agreed that whoever sells their labor benefits, and the land at home can be mutually aided. Group leader Shen Zongzhang said: We must love each other, and the weak labor force at home must ensure that no land is left uncultivated. After the plan was made, the group leaders were afraid that they would not be able to complete the plan, so they got up before dawn to call people to work. In particular, Shen Huaizhen, chairman of the farmers' association, constantly explained the policy to the masses in the mutual aid group to increase everyone's production enthusiasm. At present, the whole village is actively weeding the seedlings, and some people are preparing to go out to sell their labor. (Shen Wanzhao)

　　邢台麦地湾党员干部
  　积极领导互助锄苗
    【太行讯】邢台七区麦地湾村党员干部参加了四月十五日（旧历）的全区干部会议，了解整党政策，放下了思想包袱，工作立刻有了劲。在旧历五月初三日晚上，农会主席申怀珍召开全村六个互助组组长会议，首先检讨自己上一段“躺倒”了，没有领导生产的错误。劳英申怀珠也说：“这会要早些开，咱们的思想早通了，为啥不领导群众生产？今后一定要起带头作用，给群众当个好长工。”接着各组长汇报生产情况：种已下完，麦已割清，当下就是需要锄苗。这时有人提出把活往前赶赶，抽出劳力打些短工。农会主席说：要想去卖工，各组就得订出计划，抓紧时间，突击锄苗，要作到不荒一分地，再好去卖工。第二天晚上，各组在干部组长领导下，分别订出短期锄苗计划，四组在副村长、武委会主任领导下订计划时，首先检讨出去年锄苗的缺点：（一）地块分散零星，半天锄七八块地，移动很误工。（二）全组劳力下了地没有分工。（三）人多，算帐有些麻烦。（四）有些人锄苗重量不重质，如半劳力也把两陇，趁不上别人，又想＠全＠，自然就锄的赖，不几天又荒了。随后讨论了今年锄苗的办法：全组十八个人，自愿结合成四个小组。确实实行按活＠＠。提倡细作，在阴历五月十五日前，水地锄小苗，旱地锄二遍，棉花锄三遍，连坡地在内，十天要完成。对于打短工问题，展开了热烈争论，最后大家同意，谁卖工谁得利，家里的地可互助变工。组长申宗章说：咱们要互相友爱，在家的弱劳力要保证不荒一分地。计划订好了，各组长恐怕完不成计划，以后天不明就起来叫＠，特别是农会主席申怀珍，在互助组中随时给群众讲政策，提高大家的生产情绪，现全村正积极锄苗，一部分人准备出外卖工。　　　（申万兆）
