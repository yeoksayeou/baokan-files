　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government is plotting to suppress the expanding patriotic student movement against the US policy of fostering Japan by means of more blatant methods such as searching schools and arresting students. According to the Associated Press and the Central News Agency: On the 20th of this month, the Beiping Police Bureau sent an official letter to the authorities of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University, stating that they would go to the schools to conduct searches and train the school police to monitor student activities. This measure by the Chiang government, which blatantly undermines the personal freedom and patriotic rights of the academic community, has aroused angry protests from students of the three universities, who unanimously demanded that the school authorities firmly reject it in order to protect the safety of their fellow students.
    Another dispatch: Among the students arrested during the patriotic demonstration in front of the US Naval Headquarters in Shanghai on June 5th, ten have already been sent to the Chiang bandit's fascist "Special Criminal Tribunal" on the 23rd. The fascist head of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, in addition to clamoring to continue arresting students, also instigated his puppet organizations such as the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send telegrams demanding "the swift elimination of patriotic students with the most severe measures."

  　抗议蒋匪逮捕学生阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】蒋介石卖国政府正图以更露骨的搜查学校逮捕学生等办法，来镇压日益扩大的学生反对美国扶日政策的爱国运动。据美联社及中央社透露：本月二十日北平警察局已以公函送交北大、清华、燕京三大学当局，表示将赴各校进行搜查，并集训各校校警以监视学生行动。蒋政府此项公然摧残学界人身自由及爱国权利的措施，已引起三校学生愤怒抗议，并一致要求学校当局严正拒绝，借以保障同学生命安全。
    另讯：六月五日在上海美驻华海军总部前爱国示威的被捕学生中，已有十人于二十三日被解往蒋匪法西斯的“特种刑事法庭”，上海市长法西斯头子吴国桢除叫嚣将继续逮捕学生外，并唆使其市参议会、市商会等御用团体通电要求“以最严厉手段迅速肃清”爱国学生。
