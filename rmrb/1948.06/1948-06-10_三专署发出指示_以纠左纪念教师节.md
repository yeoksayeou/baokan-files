　　Three Special Commissioner's Office Issues Instructions
　　To Correct "Leftist" Errors and Commemorate Teachers' Day
　　[Taihang News] The Three Special Commissioner's Office recently instructed its subordinate counties to commemorate the June 6th Teachers' Day by resolutely correcting "leftist" errors regarding intellectuals and school education. The instruction first reviewed the serious "leftist" errors of the past year, stating: During the "Three Checks" study last year, counties indiscriminately purged elementary school teachers from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds. Children from landlord and rich peasant families were expelled from schools or placed under control. In counties such as Li, Lu, Hu, and Pingdeng, a widespread shortage of elementary school teachers emerged, leading to the closure of many schools. Although a new batch of teachers was promoted, their cultural level was too low to teach. The masses were dissatisfied with the schools and refused to let their children enroll. In many places, schools had no students, or very few. The current teachers also carried complex and heavy ideological burdens. Teachers from poor peasant and farmhand backgrounds believed that intellectuals were not glorious, as if they were the same as landlords; now that their families had turned over and had everything, being a teacher was not as good as being a turned-over farmer at home. Teachers from middle peasant backgrounds believed that intellectuals were unpopular and that being a teacher had no future. Teachers from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds carried even heavier burdens. Some wanted to do a good job, but felt that their class background was bad and that they would definitely be unwanted in the future. These chaotic phenomena seriously hindered the development of school education. Therefore: (1) This year's June 6th Teachers' Day, each county should universally carry out policy propaganda. It should be pointed out that teachers in a new democratic society are mental laborers and an indispensable part of educational construction. However, it must also be pointed out that ordinary intellectuals, before being reformed, have some ideas that despise the working people; especially intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families, who carry a certain bad class consciousness, must be reformed. The government adopts a policy of reforming, educating, uniting, and cherishing them. Intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds are enthusiastically cultivated, but they must not be arrogant or conceited, but develop their pure working-class consciousness, actively improve their culture, and enthusiastically work for the people. (2) Immediately abolish the poor peasant organizations in schools and the control of landlord and rich peasant children, and eliminate the idea of ​​despising them. Landlord and rich peasant children who were previously expelled and have not yet returned to school should be mobilized to enroll. It should be recognized that schools are educational institutions, and the class line of education should be manifested as new democratic, strong, ideological leadership and effective improvement of culture, considering the long-term interests of the people. Peasant children in the past could not afford to go to school or had fewer opportunities to go to school, and their cultural level was poor; they should be consciously helped to improve their culture and solve their enrollment difficulties. Landlord and rich peasant children should be strengthened in education, so that they can recognize the exploitation behavior of landlords and rich peasants and the rationality of peasant struggles, and be trained to become good citizens of the new democracy and intellectuals who serve the people. (3) Although counties are currently paying attention to this work of correcting "leftist" errors, some places are still not firm enough. For example, the Ping Shun Civil Education Section, in a summary of educational work in a certain school, proposed: "Cultivate poor peasant student backbones," "Establish the prestige of poor peasant students," and in the hanging list of tests, "Increase the scores of poor peasant students and reduce the scores of landlord and rich peasant students," believing it to be very correct. They adopt the attitude towards landlord and rich peasant children that "If they are willing to enroll, we will not refuse. If they do not come to school, we will not force them to come..." This is a remnant of "leftist" sentiments and should be immediately eliminated. In addition, in school education, it should be very clear that cultural education should be the main focus, and a lot of time should not be spent on some social activities.
　　The instruction further stipulated: (1) The June 6th Festival will be led by the county civil education section, convening a joint meeting of all county principals and senior elementary school principals to examine and discuss all specific issues in school education. (2) Teachers who were expelled last year must be dealt with separately to correct "leftist" deviations. Those who are better can be convened for a meeting immediately to restore their work, and those who generally do not have major problems can be absorbed to participate in vacation training. (3) Leaders should pay attention to solving the difficulties in teachers' lives. Individual counties where teachers' salaries are low and insufficient to maintain life should be appropriately increased.

　　三专署发出指示
  　以纠左纪念教师节
    【太行消息】三专署日前指示所属各县，纪念六六教师节，坚决纠正对知识分子及学校教育中的左倾错误。指示首先检讨一年来严重的左倾错误称：去年三查学习时，各县不分好坏，把地主富农出身的小学教员一律清洗。把一些地主富农儿童挤出校门，或管制起来。黎、潞、壶、平等县，普遍形成了小学教员的缺乏，停办了很多学校，虽曾新提拔了一批教员，但文化程度太低，教不了书。群众对学校不满意，不让子女入学。许多地方有学校无学生，或者学生太少。现任教员的同志，也存在了复杂沉重的思想包袱。贫雇出身的教员，认为知识分子不光荣，好象和地主一样；自己家里翻了身，啥也有了，当教员不如回家当翻身农民。中农出身的，认为知识分子吃不开，当教员没前途。地主富农出身的教员，包袱更重。有的想好好干，又觉得成份不好，将来一定会不要自己。这些混乱现象，严重的阻碍着学校教育的开展，因此：（一）今年的六六教师节，各县应普遍开展政策宣传。指出新民主主义社会中的教员，是脑力劳动者，是教育建设中不可缺少的一部分力量。但也必须指出，一般的知识分子，在未改造前，是有某些轻视劳动人民思想的；特别是地主富农家庭出身的知识分子，带有其一定的不良阶级意识，必须加以改造。政府对他们是采取改造、教育、团结、爱护的方针。对工农出身知识分子，是热情培养，但他们必须不自骄自傲，发扬其纯洁的劳动阶级的意识，积极的提高文化，热情为人民工作。（二）立即取消学校中的贫雇组织及管制地主富农子女，对他们鄙视的思想，地主富农儿童过去被挤掉的，现在仍未上学者，应动员其入学。应该认识：学校是教育机关，教育的阶级路线，应表现为新民主主义的、坚强的、思想领导与有效的提高文化，从人民的长远利益着想。农民子弟过去上不起学，或上学机会少，文化程度差；应该有意识地帮助他们提高文化，解决其入学困难。对地主富农子弟，应加强教育，使其认识地主富农的剥削行为，农民的斗争合理，培养为新民主主义的良好公民，及为人民服务的知识分子。（三）目前各县虽注意这一纠左工作，但某些地方仍表现不够坚决。如平顺民教科，在某学校教育工作总结中，提出：“培养贫雇学生骨干”，“树立贫雇学生威信”，在测验挂榜中，“提高贫雇学生分数，扣低地主富农学生分数”，认为很对，对地主富农子弟，采取“他们愿入学，我们不拒绝，如果不到校，我们也不去硬动员……”。这是一种左倾情绪的残余，应该立即肃清。此外在学校教育中，应该十分明确的，以文化教育为主，不应该在一些社会活动中，占很多时间。
    指示继规定：（一）六六节由县民教科领导，召开全县联合校长及高小校长会议。检查讨论学校教育中的一切具体问题。（二）对去年被挤掉的教员，必须分别处理，纠正左倾偏向。较好些的现在即可召集他们开会，立即恢复其工作，一般没大问题的，可在假期集训时，吸收他们参加。（三）教员生活困难，领导上应注意解决。个别县教员薪金低，不足维持生活的，应适当提高。
