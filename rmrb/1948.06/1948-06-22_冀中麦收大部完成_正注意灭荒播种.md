(Central Hebei News) The wheat harvest in central Hebei is mostly completed. Farmers in various areas are stepping up their efforts to plant late-season crops. The Tenth Military District, under armed protection, is actively rushing to harvest. After completing the wheat harvest, the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Military Districts are continuing to eliminate wasteland and plant late-season crops. For example, in Zhao County of the 11th Military District, after eliminating 110,000 mu of wasteland, statistics from four districts show that there are still 9,000 mu of wasteland.藁城(Gao Cheng) has also found 10,000 mu of wasteland. (Editor's note: Whose wasteland is this? What kind of wasteland is it? Is it fallow land or other wasteland? All should be investigated clearly.) Cadres have been dispatched to villages to supervise rushing to plant. The Ninth Administrative Office and other agencies have also sent more than 50 cadres to assist in harvesting and investigate wasteland. In Dong Aixinzhuang and other twelve villages in Qing County's first district, 29 mutual aid teams were organized. In addition to harvesting their own wheat, they also contracted work in other villages. Farmers in various villages, while rushing to harvest wheat, also actively carried out planting, harvesting more than 2,800 mu of wheat, plowing 6,400 mu of depressions, and eliminating a total of 147 mu of wasteland in seven days. There is still a part of the late-season crops that have not been planted in the area. Farmers are vigorously helping each other to rush to plant. In Liuzhihui Village of the 7th district of Xiyuan, farmers adopted the method of pulling out one piece and planting one piece to quickly complete the wheat harvest and planting. They pulled wheat in the morning, plowed at noon, and planted in the afternoon. From the 8th to the 12th, in five days, most of the wheat fields were pulled out and late-season crops were planted. In Renqiu Zhengzhou Nanguan, a total of more than 1,200 mu of wheat fields were harvested. With the mutual assistance of all the villagers, nine-tenths of the work was completed in six days. Liberated farmers in various places are happily harvesting their newly distributed wheat fields. For example, when farmers in Zhengzhou harvested wheat, they sang everywhere in the fields and threshing grounds: "The wheat is yellow, in June, hey, the wheat that is driven out is thin and long, take a bite and taste it, the Communist Party is the savior," "Before picking up the bowl, my heart is moved, I think of my benefactor Mao Zedong" and other ditties. During the wheat harvest, the farmers automatically organized mutual assistance and solved the harvesting difficulties for some military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and civilian laborers supporting the front lines who lacked labor. At the same time, some villages also paid attention to urging landlords and rich peasants to produce. Women in various places also actively participated in the wheat harvest. For example, in Dong Aixinzhuang and other twelve villages in Qing County, more than 650 women participated in the wheat harvest. The daughters-in-law of Diansi in Dong Aixinzhuang and other three women went to other villages to contract wheat pulling after pulling their own wheat. Chen Daxing, a young military dependent woman in Xiliang Village, Renqiu, was the only person left in her family after her husband joined the army. When it came to the wheat harvest, the village sent someone to harvest the wheat for her, but she resolutely refused and finished pulling five mu of wheat by herself in two days. Small-footed women also pulled like men. For example, He Xiuyun and other six women in Jianglinhe Village, Renqiu, organized themselves and pulled 37 mu in three days.

　　冀中麦收大部完成
  　正注意灭荒播种
    【冀中讯】冀中麦收，大部地区现已完成，各地农民正加紧进行播种晚田。十分区在武装掩护下，正积极抢收。八、九、十、一三个分区完成麦收后，现正在继续消灭荒地，进行晚田播种。如十一分区赵县，消灭了十一万亩荒地后，据四个区的统计现还有荒地九千亩，藁城亦查出荒地一万亩，（编者按：这些荒地是什么人的？是那一种荒地？是轮荒地还是别的什么荒地，都应调查清楚。）现已派干部下乡督促抢种。九专署等机关也派干部五十多名，一面助收，一面查荒。青县一区东艾辛庄等十二个村，组织了二十九个互助组，除收割自己的麦子外，并到外村包工。各村农民一面突击麦收，一面进行积极播种，七天中割麦二千八百余亩，耕窝田六千四百余亩，共消灭了荒地一百四十七亩。现该区还有一部晚田没种上，农民正大力互助抢种中。西苑七区刘指挥村，该村农民为迅速完成麦收播种，采取了拔一块种一块的办法，早晨拔麦，晌午耕，下午播种，从八日到十二日五天中，麦田已大部拔完后上晚田。任邱郑州南关共收麦地一千二百余亩，在全村农民互助抢收下，六天中已完成十分之九。各地翻身农民，都愉快的收割着新分得的麦田，如郑州农民收麦时，地里场里到处唱：“麦子黄又黄，在六月六日，嘿，赶出麦来细又长，咬一口尝一尝，救命恩人共产党”、“未从端碗心一动，想起恩人毛泽东”等小调。在收麦时，农民们自动组织互助，并解决了一些缺乏劳动力的军干烈属和支前民工等的收麦困难。同时有些村庄还注意督促地富生产。在麦收中，各地妇女也都积极参加，如青县东艾辛庄等十二个村，参加麦收的妇女即达六百五十余人，东艾辛庄殿寺的媳妇等三个妇女，拔完自己的麦子，还到外村包工拔麦。任邱西凉村军属青年妇女陈大杏，丈夫参军后，家里只剩下她一个人，麦收时，村里派人给她收麦，但她坚决不肯，自己两天中就把五亩麦子拔完了。小脚妇女也和男人一样的拔，如任邱姜临河村何秀云等六个妇女组织起来，三天拔了三十七亩。
