　　Yangcheng Production Committee Calls for Organized Rush to Weed Seedlings
　　Jincheng Demands Branch Party Members Strengthen Leadership in Weeding Seedlings
　　[Report from this newspaper] Yangcheng's spring plowing and sowing work has been completed in most areas and is beginning to shift to weeding seedlings. However, in some villages, due to inadequate correction of deviations, production has been affected. According to statistics from 159 villages, there are still 2,079 mu that have not been sown, 7,023 mu where seedlings have not been properly managed, 22 villages in the third district where 344 mu have been left unsown without fertilization, and 144 mu that were not properly plowed. In addition, there are 2,395 mu of new and old wasteland from previous years. To address this, the county Production Committee has instructed:
　　1. Immediately organize a rush to weed seedlings. All mutual aid teams should fully shift to weeding work, launching a campaign for early, meticulous, and vigorous weeding. Currently, production work should focus on weeding, with transportation and other work subordinated to weeding. Those who have not joined mutual aid teams should also be organized to rush to weed, with young and strong individuals taking the lead. Young and middle-aged women should temporarily pause spinning and weaving, while older women should take on the task of watching children and cooking. Time must be allocated and organized well, with men focusing on weeding while squeezing out time for picking leaves, and women participating in weeding without neglecting silkworm feeding. We must strive to completely weed all millet seedlings before wheat harvesting, ensuring that not a single mu of seedlings is left untended.
　　2. Seize the time to replant blank spaces and eliminate wasteland. Regardless of whose land it is, or what difficulties exist, for land that has not been sown or seedlings that have not been properly managed, concrete assistance must be provided, helping each other and finding ways to sow or replant. Whatever can be planted should be planted. Those who own wasteland from previous years must be mobilized to cultivate it themselves. If they are genuinely unable to do so, the masses and mutual aid teams should be mobilized to cultivate it collectively, achieving the goal of not leaving a single mu of land uncultivated. To implement the above work, it is necessary to rectify mutual aid organizations through deviation correction. Currently, there are many chaotic phenomena in mutual aid teams, such as some teams being formed by name assignment, with designated leaders. Some have replaced all former leaders with poor and hired peasants. Some mutual aid teams do not use labor points to assess individual contributions for living expenses, do not base points on skill level, ignore semi-laborers, and some even have unpaid labor. All of these should be corrected. In particular, past wages should be appropriately adjusted in conjunction with deviation correction. We should actively engage with the masses, inspire them to consciously implement the three principles of "democracy, equivalence, and voluntarism," avoiding both administrative orders and laissez-faire. Rectify mutual aid organizations in conjunction with deviation correction. (Xin Yangcheng Bao)

　　[Taiyue News] The deviation correction work in the fourth district of Yangcheng has come to an end, and the focus of work has now shifted to weeding seedlings. Since last autumn and winter, the entire district has placed under control 117 landlord households with 452 people, 235 rich peasant households with 991.5 people, 373 middle peasant households with 2,443 people, and 5 poor peasant households with a total of 19 people. After a month of deviation correction, these people have been released from control and have been compensated and resettled. After these problems were resolved, the enthusiasm for production gradually increased. The entire district has planted over 39,000 mu of millet. From May 24th to 26th, in three days, more than 19,800 mu have been weeded. All 1,500 mu of millet land in Taotuo Village has been completely weeded. Women, old men, and children in various villages have generally gone to the fields. In Yanli Zuzhuang, thirteen women in one neighborhood followed the men to weed the seedlings. The entire district has also replanted 419 mu of millet land with missing seedlings, replanted 319 mu of cotton, and planted 3,415 mu of spring corn. Taking advantage of spare time, transportation has been arranged to alleviate the difficulties of the spring famine. From planting millet to now, a total of 2,033 people and 415 livestock have gone out, earning over 45.4 million yuan, and most of the goods transported back are cotton, food, and salt. Now, while weeding seedlings, deviation correction continues.

　　[Report from this newspaper] Jincheng Labor People's News calls on the entire county to rush to weed seedlings. It particularly demands that Party member comrades in village branches strengthen leadership in weeding, use concrete accounting methods to get through to the masses, and, on the basis of farmers' conscious willingness, organize all men, women, full, and semi-laborers in the village. Female Party members and female cadres should take the lead as models and go to the fields to weed seedlings. County and district cadres should not sit in the shade of trees to lead the masses in weeding, nor should they sleep through the morning and then call a midnight meeting of the masses; this is not called leading production. We must also pick up small hoes and go to the fields with the farmers, discuss work in the millet fields where seedlings are being weeded, and solve problems in the mutual aid teams where seedlings are being weeded. Personally gain experience in production and deviation correction, and use every opportunity to promote and encourage everyone, even during meal times in the farmers' fields. It also put forward the recent production slogan: "Weed millet seedlings, weed bean seedlings, men, women, old and young, mobilize together! Guarantee that not a single mu of seedlings is left untended, and strive to complete the weeding in half a month!"

　　[Another report] In Weichuan Village, third district, before the start of weeding, a meeting of village cadres and mutual aid team leaders was held. They proposed: Our village lacks labor, so we must start early and ensure that not a single mu of the village's more than 1,000 mu of autumn land (including cotton fields) is left untended this year. More than a dozen large and small mutual aid teams in the village went to the fields one after another. In the past two days (up to the 21st), more than 100 mu have been weeded. For example, Yan Laiqun's team has weeded 12 mu of its 20 mu of millet land. Yan Laiqun is 53 years old, a military dependent. He planted his millet early, and he was also among the first to start weeding. He said, "There are too few people in our team, so the slow bird must fly early." The weeding campaign is now underway throughout the village.

　　阳城生产委员会号召
    组织起来突击锄苗
  　晋城要求支部党员加强锄苗领导
    【本报消息】阳城春耕下种工作，大部地区已经完成，开始转向锄苗，还有部分村因纠偏不认真，影响生产，据一百五十九个村统计：还有二零七九亩没下种，七零二三亩没捉好苗，三区二二村没上粪空种三四四亩，没犁硬种的有一四四亩，加上几年来的荒地共新旧荒地二三九五亩。为此县生产委员会指示：
    一、立即组织起来突击锄苗。所有互助组，应全力转向锄苗工作，掀起早锄细锄大力突击锄苗运动。目前生产工作应以锄苗为主，运输及其他工作，应服从锄苗工作。没参加互助组的群众，也要组织起来突击锄苗，青壮年要积极带头锄苗，青壮中年妇女们要暂停纺花车，放松织布机，老年妇女们要担负起看娃娃做饭的工作，要把时间分配好组织好，男人抓紧锄苗，又挤出时间摘叶，女人们参加锄苗，又不耽误喂蚕。必须争取在割麦前把谷苗完全锄完，不让荒一亩苗。
    二、抓紧时间，补种空白，消灭荒地。没种上的地，和苗没捉好的地，不论是谁的，不论有什么困难，一定要具体帮助，互助互济设法种上补上，能补什么，就补什么，历年的荒地，一定要动员本人开种，如本人确实不能开种者，应动员群众，互助组集体开种，达到不荒一亩地的要求。为贯彻上边工作，就必须从纠偏工作中，整顿互助组织。现在互助组中，存在着不少混乱现象，如有的互助组是点名编组，指定组长，有的把原来组长，都换成贫雇农，有的互助组不按个人劳动力做的生活评分，给工资，有的不按技术高低定分，有的抹煞半劳力，还有的无代价劳动，这些都应纠正。特别是旧有工资，应该结合纠偏，适当纠正；应积极深入群众，启发自觉执行“民主、等价、自愿”三个原则，既不行政命令，又不放任自流，结合纠偏工作，整顿互助组织。（新阳城报）
    【太岳消息】阳城四区纠偏工作告一段落，现工作重心转入锄苗。全区去年秋冬以来，共管制起地主一百一十七户，四百五十二口人；富农二百卅五户，九百九十一口半人；中农三百七十三户，两千四百四十三口人；贫农五户，共十九口人。经过一月的纠偏，这些人都解除了管制，并进行了补偿安置。这些问题解决后，生产劲头慢慢高起来了。全区共种谷地三万九千余亩，从五月廿四日到廿六日三天里，已锄了一万九千八百余亩。陶沱村谷地共一千五百亩，已全部锄完。各村妇女老汉儿童普遍的上了地；演礼卒庄一个闾内有十三个妇女跟着男人去锄苗，全区又补种没苗谷地四百一十九亩，补种棉花三百一十九亩，点种春玉茭三千四百一十五亩，又趁空闲运输解决春荒困难，从种谷到现在，共出外两千零三十三人，牲口四百一十五头，共赚洋四千五百四十余万元，运回的东西大部分是棉花食粮和食盐等。现在一面锄苗一面继续进行纠偏。
    【本报消息】晋城劳动人民报号召全县突击锄苗。特别要求各村支部党员同志对锄苗工作加强领导，用具体算帐的方法打通群众思想，并在农民自觉自愿的基础上，组织起全村男女全半劳动力，女党员女干部更要带头起模范下地锄苗。县区干部同志们不要坐在树凉底下领导群众锄苗，不要白天睡上一前晌，夜晚召集群众开个半夜会，这不叫领导生产。我们也要拿起小锄头和农民一块上地，有工作到锄小苗的谷地里去谈，有问题到锄小苗的互助组里去解决，亲自动手搞出点生产和纠偏的经验，端上饭碗就在农民的饭场上也宣传推动大家。并提出最近生产口号：“谷锄马耳豆锄苗，男女老幼齐动员！保证不荒一亩苗，争取半月苗锄完！”
    【又息】三区苇町村，在锄苗开始前，召开了一次村干部互助组长会议，他们提出：咱村缺乏劳力，要早些下手，全村一千多亩秋地（棉花地在内），今年保证不荒一亩苗。全村大小十来个互助组陆续下地，两天来（到二十一日）已锄有一百多亩，如阎来群的一组，二十亩谷地，已锄了十二亩。阎来群五十三岁了，是个军属，种谷时他早早就种上了，锄苗还是数他动手早，他说：“咱组里人太少，笨鸟要先飞”。现全村锄苗运动正开展中。
