　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Wan-Su, 10th: The Yu-Wan-Su District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued important instructions to party committees at all levels, determining that mobilizing the masses, suppressing local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, organizing the defense of the wheat harvest, and crushing the enemy's attempts to seize grain are the central tasks for the entire district at present. The instructions pointed out: To this end, we must first oppose the pacifist mentality among cadres that ignores the tense situation between the enemy and ourselves; oppose the erroneous view of burying oneself in the distribution of land, regardless of the masses' level of awareness and the actual conditions of struggle in the new areas; oppose the erroneous view of "distributing floating wealth and land as the only central task," which only sees the superficial phenomenon of a few masses demanding the distribution of wheat fields, while failing to see the urgent demand of the broad masses for suppressing bandits, defending themselves, protecting their homes and wheat harvests, and stabilizing order. This will damage the masses' wheat harvest. The instructions pointed out: As for the specific methods for defending the wheat harvest, party committees at all levels should immediately convene mobilization meetings to explain the great significance of defending the wheat harvest, correct the erroneous methods of forcibly distributing land and bestowing land, and quickly concentrate all the strength of the party, government, and army on defending the wheat harvest. Under the condition of not violating the farming season, convene district and village peasant representative conferences or peasant congresses and gatherings in towns and villages to expose the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain, organize armed joint defense, and defend the wheat harvest. All local staff must work with the masses to organize the wheat harvest, prevent bandits and counter-revolutionaries, regulate labor, and achieve rapid harvesting, rapid threshing, and rapid storage. The garrison troops should help the people harvest without compensation, send strong cadres to strengthen local armed forces at all levels, organize work teams to launch political offensives, and carry out guerrilla warfare in the border areas to cover the wheat harvest. All materials, grain, livestock, etc., seized in the bandit suppression should be distributed to the masses. The victims of famine should be properly handled, and the victims of the flooded areas should be properly resettled so that they can return home for the summer harvest and summer planting and help them settle down and establish their businesses. Non-flooded area victims who wish to settle down in the local area should also be helped.

　　豫皖苏区党委指示所属
  　发动群众剿匪保麦
    【新华社豫皖苏十日电】中共豫皖苏区党委，顷向各级党委发出重要指示，确定以发动群众，清剿土顽蒋匪，组织保卫麦收，粉碎敌人抢粮企图，为全区当前中心任务。该指示指出：为此，首先应在干部中反对忽视敌我紧张形势的太平观念；反对不顾群众觉悟水平及新区现实斗争条件，企图埋头于分配土地的错误观点；反对只看到少数群众要求分麦地的表面现象，而看不到广大群众对于剿匪自卫，保家保麦和安定秩序的迫切要求，依然固执地以“分浮财分土地为唯一中心工作”的错误观点。这将使群众麦收遭受损害。指示中指出：保卫麦收的具体办法，各级党委立即召开动员会，说明保卫麦收的重大意义，纠正强迫分地，恩赐土地的错误办法，迅速把党政军全部力量集中于保卫麦收。在不违农时条件下，召开区村农代会或农民大会及集镇讲演会等，揭发敌人抢粮阴谋，组织武装联防，保卫麦收。全体地方工作人员，必须与群众一起，组织麦收，防匪反特，调节劳动，实现快收、快打、快藏。驻军应无代价地帮助人民收割，派强有力的干部加强各级地方武装，组织武工队开展政治攻势，开展边沿区游击战争，掩护麦收。剿匪中缴获物资、粮食、牲口等，一律发给群众，对荒灾民，应妥善处理，对泛区灾民，应妥为安置，使其能回家夏收夏种，并帮助其安家立业。非泛区灾民，如愿在当地入家者，亦应予以帮助。
