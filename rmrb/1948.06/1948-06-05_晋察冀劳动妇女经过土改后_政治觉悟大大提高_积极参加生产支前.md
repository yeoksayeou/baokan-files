Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd – After the land reform, the political awareness of the laboring women in Jin-Cha-Ji has greatly improved. They actively participate in production, support the front lines, and engage in political and cultural activities. The number of women organized to participate in major agricultural production is gradually increasing. Women in Wanping said, "We women also have a share of the land now that it's been equally distributed, so we have to produce well." In Wanping, 101 out of 113 villages have women's labor teams. In Fozi Village, Liangxiang, 75 women recently organized 20 labor teams to replace the men who went to the front lines to support the war effort in a spring plowing blitz. In twelve days, they plowed 125 mu of land, delivered 890 baskets of manure, and sowed 117 mu. In Nanfangshui Village, Wangdu, women delivered more than 900 small carts of manure in ten days. Many women plow and pull seed drills (i.e., use manpower to pull wooden sowing tools - editor), and are no weaker than men. Wang Shuxian from Fozi Village, Liangxiang, and Nie Xianggui from Beilou Village, Anguo, both work very well. Women in Laishui, Wanping, Wangdu, Zhuolu, Anguo, and other counties have mostly organized mutual aid labor teams. The scope of women's involvement in rural sideline occupations is even wider. In Xinnanqiao Village, Anguo, eighteen women's spinning groups use eighty spinning wheels and six looms, working in shifts day and night. Zheng Xiuhua, a female labor hero from Yanchi Village, Lingqiu, leads women to collect firewood in the mountains. Recently, women in twenty-three villages in Laishui collected more than 177,000 catties of firewood in twenty days. Liu Delian and 30 other women in Dongguan, Dacheng, have boiled 190 catties of niter and 240 catties of salt in eight days. More than 80 women in Xinan Cai Village, Pingding, engaged in transportation production, earning more than 6 million Border Region currency in one month. Women in Ganhe Village, in the same county, even went down into kilns to mine sulfur ore, earning three catties of millet per day, breaking the superstition that women would "offend the kiln gods."

The women's achievements in supporting the front are also great. In a certain battle, women in four districts of a certain county once carried more than 3,000 catties of grain to the front lines. For example, women in Baifa and other villages in Fangshan County diligently cared for wounded soldiers passing through, day and night. Women in nine villages in Wanping rushed to make 1,800 military uniforms for soldiers. More than 50 women in Wang Qianzhuang, Hunyuan, voluntarily carried more than 250 boxes of ammunition. Women in various places are also active in cultural, social, and political activities. In old areas such as Wanping and Laishui in western Hebei, many rural women under the age of 25 can already read 100 to 300 characters. The "rooftop broadcasts" in various villages in Fangshan are one of the powerful tools for publicizing current affairs and calling meetings in the rural areas of the North China Liberated Area (the method is that one or several people use loudspeakers to speak to the masses in the whole village from the roof - editor). Now, they are mostly done by women. According to statistics from twenty-three villages in Laishui, Wanping, and Changwan (newly established county consisting of parts of Changping and Wanping), eighty-nine women have been elected as village-level cadres, twenty-three as district-level cadres, and three as county-level cadres. In four villages in Changwan, seventy-four women were elected as representatives to the district and village people's congresses. Women account for more than 30% of the cadres at both the district and village levels in the first district of Fangshan.
