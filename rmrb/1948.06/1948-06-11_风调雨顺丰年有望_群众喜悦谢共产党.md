　　Favorable Weather Promises a Bountiful Harvest
  　The Masses Rejoice and Thank the Communist Party
    [Our dispatch] As the busy season of Mangzhong (Grain in Ear) arrives, Wuan, Handan, Xingtai and other places experienced their fourth widespread and thorough rainfall on June 6th and 7th. People from all walks of life rejoiced wildly, sharing the joy of this year's favorable weather and the prospect of a full harvest. The masses in Hexi Village, Wuan, returning from the fields, chatted animatedly at mealtime, discussing how timely the rain had been since spring and how timely the sowing had been. Jia Deming clearly recounted: the first thorough rain was on the second and third days of the second lunar month, just when plowing before the Spring Equinox required a thorough rain. The second thorough rain was on the twenty-eighth and ninth days of the second lunar month, precisely the season before Grain Rain for planting cotton and dibbling beans and sowing sorghum. The third thorough rain was on the eighth and ninth days of the fourth lunar month, approaching Grain Rain, perfect for planting millet. The fourth thorough rain was on the twenty-ninth day of the fourth lunar month and the first day of the fifth lunar month, the time for harvesting wheat and planting wheat stubble fields, sowing corn, late millet, foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, various beans, and various coarse grains. At this point, he said very proudly to everyone: "Each rain was a gentle drizzle, lasting two days and one night, the rainwater completely soaking into the ground. After the rain, the weather cleared up immediately, allowing people to work in the fields. After each planting, there was another light rain of two or three fingers' depth every ten days or so, perfect for nurturing the seedlings. Since this spring, it has truly been five winds and ten rains, a sign of a good year. Moreover, people coming from the north and going west have heard that 'each rain is widespread, covering a wide area, with all places receiving rain.'" Zhang Wendou, an old man of fifty, said even more excitedly: "In all my years, I have never experienced a year with such timely rain. Each rain comes four or five days, ten days or so, before the solar term, soaking the ground thoroughly, allowing those with and without livestock to plow and plant within ten and a half days. Each rain is the land waiting for the people, not the people waiting for the land. I remember only one year in my childhood that was similar to this year. That year, after the wheat harvest, everyone waited four or five days for rain." At this point, he asked others who were even older: "Do you remember any year with such timely rain as this year?" Zhang Xifan and others older than him all said: "We have never remembered a year with such timely rain as this year!" Then everyone discussed the Communist Party's leadership in mass production. Zhang Wendou said with great confidence: "Since the Communist Party led the people to safely overcome the great disaster of 1931 and 1932 and put forward the call for mutual aid and labor exchange to achieve prosperity, the harvest each year from 1933 to the present has been better than before. Take wheat planting, for example. Before 1933, our mountain land only yielded one or two dou (a unit of dry measure) and eight sheng (a unit of dry measure, one-tenth of a dou) per mu (a unit of area, about 0.165 acres). Since the Communist Party led production and promoted deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, each mu has yielded an average of three or four da dou (a large dou, each dou weighing 28 jin, about 80 to 100 pounds). Take our Wuan last year, for example. During the fourth and fifth lunar months, there was no thorough rain, and each rain was only a little over an inch deep. According to the old folk experience, it was impossible to plant, but the Communist Party organized the people to carry water for emergency planting every day. Just as the seedlings emerged, they were about to die from drought, and the Communist Party led the people to carry water to save the seedlings. Some land was not planted with late seedlings until the middle of June, after the solar term. The people sighed and were not confident, and everyone thought that a great disaster was coming again. But they still held hope for the Communist Party's call. In mid-June, a thorough rain fell, and the seedlings grew rapidly and very well. At harvest time, good land yielded more than one da shi (a large stone, equivalent to 280 pounds), general land yielded seven or eight da dou (equivalent to about 200 pounds), and even bad land yielded four or five da dou (also equivalent to about 190 pounds). As a result, disaster was turned into a bumper harvest. Because the autumn harvest was late last year, it seemed impossible to plant wheat. The Communist Party called again to interplant wheat in the autumn seedling fields. As a result, each mu of wheat yielded an average of three or four da dou this year. Listening to the Communist Party is never wrong. Even if there was no thorough rain last spring, we still had a bumper harvest. This year, we have already had four thorough rains. With the Communist Party leading production, how can we not have a bumper harvest?"

　　风调雨顺丰年有望
  　群众喜悦谢共产党
    【本报消息】正当农忙的芒种季节，武安、邯郸、邢台等地又于六月六、七两日第四次普降透雨，各阶层人民欢腾若狂，共喜今年风调雨顺，全年丰收有望。武安河西村群众繁忙的从地里回来，大家在饭市上吃饭时一碰头，就畅谈起今春以来雨水及时、下种及时。贾德明很清楚的追述着：第一场透雨是阴历（以下皆阴历）二月初二、三，恰是春分以前犁地需要透雨。第二场透雨是二月二十八、九，正是谷雨前好种棉的节令和点豆耩高粱的时机。第三场透雨是四月初八、九，已将到谷雨节，种谷子正好。第四场透雨是四月二十九、五月初一，又是收了麦子种麦茬地，耩玉茭、晚谷、黍子、稷子、各种豆子和各种杂粮的时候。至此，他很得意的向大家说：每次透雨，都是微风细雨，下两天一夜，雨水完全追到地里去，下罢雨、马上晴天，人们就能到地里去动弹。每次种上庄稼，每隔十来天又下一场二三指的小雨，正是养苗雨。今春以来，真是五风十雨，好年景的预兆，而且从北来的西往的人听说：“每次都是普雨，面很宽，各地方都下了。”五十岁的老汉张文斗更兴奋的说：“我记事以来，一辈子啦，还没有经过这样雨水及时的年头，每场雨都是下在节令前头四五天、十来天，下的地很透，十天半月内有牲口的没牲口的都能耕种上，每场雨都是地等人，不是人等地。我小时记的只有一年和今年差不多，那一年收罢麦子，大家还等了个四、五天。”说到这里，他问其他年纪更老的人：“你们记不记的有象今年这样雨水及时的年头？”比他年纪大的张喜范等都说：“从来没有记的有象今年这样雨水及时的年头！”接着大家又谈到共产党对群众生产的领导，张文斗很有信心的说：“自从共产党领导老百姓很安全的渡过三十一、二年的大灾荒，提出互助变工生产致富的号召以来，从三十三年起到现在，每年收成比以前都好了。就以种麦子说吧，三十三年以前，咱这山地每亩只收斗儿八升，自从共产党领导生产，提倡深耕细作，以后每年每亩均拉都收三四大斗（每斗二十八斤约八十斤到一百斤左右）。就象咱武安去年那样灾荒，到阴历四五月还没落一次透雨，每下一场雨，只是一指多深，按老百姓的旧历经验不能耩地，可是共产党天天组织老百姓挑水抢种。刚出来苗，又快旱死了，共产党又领导老百姓挑水救苗。有的地到六月十几才种上晚苗，节令已经过了，老百姓都是唉声叹气的没有信心，大家都以为大灾荒又要来了。可是对共产党的号召，总还抱着希望。到六月中旬一下透雨，苗子呜啦呜的长起来了，长的非常好。到秋收时，好地打一大石多（合二百八十斤），一般地七八大斗（合二百斤左右）。坏地亦收四五大斗（亦合一百九十斤）结果变灾荒而为丰收。因为去年秋收晚，眼看种不上麦子啦，共产党又号召：在秋苗地里串种麦子，结果今年每亩麦子均拉又收三四大斗。听了共产党的话，就是没有错，象去年春季没有一场透雨还丰收啦，今年已经有了四场透雨，按共产党的领导生产，还能不丰收吗？”
