　　From Darkness to Light
  　　A Record of Kang Shichang's Transformation from Fear of Being Killed
    Kang Shichang is from Dongguan, Linfen. He is nineteen years old this year and studied at the Linfen Provincial Normal School's preliminary teacher training class. Under the long-term reactionary education of the Yan bandit regime, he was very afraid and hostile towards the People's Liberation Army (PLA). After he was liberated by the PLA, his fear of being killed was very serious. However, after the Linfen work team educated him on the lenient policies of the democratic government, he quickly transformed and joined the work of the Urban Work Committee. Looking back on the past, he said very happily: "Now I have gone from darkness to light." The following is the process of his ideological transformation.
    The Yan bandits daily propagated to the students that the Eighth Route Army had "twenty-four tortures, thirty-six killings," "if you aren't killed now, you will be killed in the future," "if you aren't killed at the front, you will be killed at the rear," "if you aren't killed during the day, you will be killed at night," "communism means shared wives," etc. After listening to this, I felt that the Eighth Route Army was even worse than Yan Xishan. Once, my classmate Ren Fusheng was wounded by a shell while building fortifications outside the South Gate. I hated the Eighth Route Army even more and was determined to avenge my classmate. On April 9th, I volunteered to join the army and was assigned to the student team of the 197th Regiment of the 66th Division. I guarded the pillbox of the Dongguan flour mill with more than a dozen soldiers. But the next day, the Eighth Route Army entered Dongguan. I ran to a cellar where workers were hiding. Suddenly, the Eighth Route Army called out from above, saying that if we didn't come out, they would throw bombs. At that time, I felt that since I was going to die anyway, it might be better to pretend to be a worker. Who knew that after going out, the Eighth Route Army saw that everyone was trembling with fear and said kindly, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't kill people, don't be afraid. The battle is not over yet, go back into the cave to hide for now." This confused me, but when I remembered the saying "The Eighth Route Army won't kill you today, but will kill you tomorrow," I knew why I could survive for the moment. After the battle, I and those workers were sent to a cave in the reception center. There was a哨兵 (sentry) at the door, and I felt that something was wrong. Probably my death was approaching, and I estimated that I would die very tragically. I had heard people say that "after the Eighth Route Army locks people in a cave, for example, if there are ten people inside, they wait until they are so hungry that they are no longer human. Then they pull out one person, strip them naked, wash them clean, put them in a steamer to heat them up, and then stuff them through the window for the nine people to eat. After the nine people have eaten, they are so hungry again that they are no longer human, and another person is pulled out to be steamed and fed to the eight people. In this way, they steam one and eat one, and the ten people will eat each other completely." When I thought of this, I trembled all over. Why would the Eighth Route Army come up with such a cruel torture method to kill people?" But after four or five days, the Eighth Route Army did not come to kill us. I only saw the comrades of the work team talking about the current situation and tasks, the Land Law Outline, etc. I simply didn't believe it, because I had heard that the struggles in the villages had killed everyone. I was just worried about which day I would die at the hands of the Eighth Route Army. After a few more days, the Eighth Route Army sent me to the rear reception center in a village. I understood that it must be "if you aren't killed at the front, you will be killed at the rear." But when I was walking on the road, I discovered something that was beyond my expectations. People said: "In the liberated areas, the struggles have killed everyone, and the fields are completely barren." But when I passed through that village, I encountered men, women, old and young, all lively and bustling, and the crops were growing lushly green. I began to doubt whether the Eighth Route Army killed people. When I arrived at that village, the work team patiently explained to me the "current situation and tasks" and the "Land Law Outline." To prove whether what they said was reliable, I found some ordinary people and asked: "Do you think the Eighth Route Army is more terrible than Yan Xishan?" They said: "Not at all, they are much better, they don't take a needle or a thread from the masses." I said: "Has the Eighth Route Army killed people?" They said: "They never kill good people." I said: "When distributing land, do the powerful get more and the powerless get less?" They said: "Everyone gets a share." I said: "Isn't there a leading meeting for struggle? Are the landlords and rich peasants swept out of the house?" They said: "There is no such thing now, landlords and rich peasants get the same amount of land as the peasants..." At this point, I completely believed the words of the work team, eliminated the fear of being killed, and studied various policies with peace of mind. After the city was opened, I joined the work team to work in the city. When I promoted the policies of the democratic government to my comrades, they were very surprised and said: "How are you still alive?" They quickly looked at my nose to see if it had been pierced with wire. I smiled and said: "There is no such thing at all, I haven't even been slapped once."

　　从黑暗到光明
  　记康世昌怕杀思想的转变
    康世昌是临汾东关人，今年十九岁，在临汾省立师范初师班肄业，他在阎匪长期反动教育下，对解放军非常害怕和仇视，当他被解放军解放后，害怕杀头的思想非常严重。但是经过临汾工作队进行民主政府的宽大政策等教育后，他很快的转变过来，并参加城市工作委员会的工作。他回想过去时，非常高兴的说：“现在我从黑暗走到光明了”。以下就是他的思想转变经过。
    阎匪每天向学生宣传八路军有“二十四刑、三十六杀”、“现在不杀将来杀”、“前方不杀后方杀”、“白天不杀黑夜杀”、“共产公妻”等，我听了之后，感到八路军比阎锡山还要坏的多。一次同学任福生在南门外做工事被炮弹打伤，我越发痛恨八路军，决心要给同学报仇。四月九日，我自报参军，编在六十六师一九七团学生队，和十余个士兵守东关面粉厂的炮楼，但第二天八路军打进东关来了，我跑到一个有工人躲藏的地洞里去，忽然八路军在上面叫唤出来，不出来就要扔炸弹，这时我感到反正都是死，冒充工人出也许死的好一些。谁知出去之后，八路军看见大家怕的发抖，便和气的说：“八路军不杀人，不要害怕，现在战斗还没有结束，进去洞里躲躲再说。”这把我弄糊涂了，但是当我想起“八路军今天不杀明天杀”的花样，我知道现在为什么能够苟延残喘了。战斗结束后，我和那些工人被送到招待所的一座窑洞里，门上有个放哨的，就感到情形有点不对，大概死日快到了，并且我估计一定会死得很悲惨。我听人说过“八路军把人关在窑洞之后，好比里面是十个人，就等他们饿的不成人的时候，从里面拉出一个人，脱光衣服洗干净，放在蒸笼蒸热，然后从窗子塞进去，让这九个人吃完之后，九个人又饿的不成，又拉出一个人去蒸熟，让这八个人吃，这样蒸一个吃一个，十个人就互相吃完了。“我想到这里，浑身发抖，八路军为什么会想出这种残忍的刑法杀人呢？”但是过了四五天不见八路军来杀，只见那些工作队同志每天讲什么目前形势与任务啦，土地法大纲啦，我根本就不相信，因为我听说村里斗争把人杀光了。只是苦恼的想着到底那一天才死在八路军的手里呢？又过几天，八路军把我送到后方的招待所里村去，这一下我明白了，必然是“前方不杀后方杀”，但是当我走在路上时，发现出我意料之外的一件事情，人家都说：“解放区搞斗争杀的没有人，田地完全荒芜了。但是当我经过那一个村庄，遇有男女老少热热闹闹，庄稼长的油绿绿的，我开始怀疑八路军是否杀人。到了那村，工作队又耐心向我讲起“目前形势与任务”与“土地法大纲”，为了证明他们所讲的是否可靠，我找到一些老百姓问道：“你觉得八路军是否比阎锡山厉害，”他们说：“一点也不厉害，好的多哩，不拿群众一针一线。”我说：“八路军杀过人吗”？他们说：“从来不杀好人”。我说：“分土地是否有势力的多分，没势力的少分”。他们说：“人人有一份”。我说：“不是斗争要开带头会吗？地主富农被扫地出门吗？”他们说：“现在没有这种事情了，地主富农和农民分得一样多的土地……。”这一下，我完全相信工作队的话，消除了怕杀头的顾虑，安心学习各种政策。打开城后，我参加工作队进城工作，给同志学宣传民主政府的政策时，他们非常惊讶的说：“你怎么还在世上”，连忙看我的鼻子是否给铁丝穿过，我笑着说：“根本没有这回事情，连耳光都没有打过一次。”
