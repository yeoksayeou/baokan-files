　　Zhang Xiaojian's "Acting Like a Tyrant" is Not Factual

　　The reading group of Hewang Village, Third District, Juye County, after reading the news about Comrade Zhang Xiaojian "acting like a tyrant" in the new district, published on the first page of the People's Daily on March 24, felt that it was inconsistent with the facts and had elements of fabrication. A clarification is provided as follows:

　　1. The article states that the Hewang Village Cooperative is entirely Zhang Xiaojian's, without any shares from the masses. In fact, Comrade Zhang, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses, led the masses to establish a cooperative. The Military Committee invested 20,000 yuan in shares, the masses 47,000 yuan, and there were also two shis of wheat from fines as the masses' production shares. Comrade Zhang also invested 20,000 yuan, but not all of it was his.

　　2. The article states that Comrade Zhang secretly sold the two shis of wheat from fines. The fined wheat belonged to Wang Zhulin and Wang Xiao, one shi each. It was entered into the cooperative by Liu Xingcheng, chairman of the village farmers' association, and is still being used for production in the cooperative, not secretly sold by him.

　　3. Zhang Hongfa (the current village chief) was a village policeman in 1946 and was captured by the Chiang army. He was threatened to find Fang Shengxin, the director of the Military Committee. He was forced to lead the Chiang army to Fang Shengxin's home. This is a fact, but it was discussed by Fang Shengxin's father and Ru De, the vice chairman of the village farmers' association, in February of this year. Comrade Zhang did not know about it. The article claims that Comrade Zhang was afraid that if he was criticized, no one would be willing to be the village chief, so he did not allow opinions to be raised. This is a false accusation.

　　张效俭“作威作福”不合事实
    綘县第三区河王村读报小组，看到人民日报三月二十四日，第一版登载张效俭同志，在新区作威作福的消息，阅后觉得不合事实，有客里空之处，特作如下说明：
    一、稿中说河王村合作社，完全是张效俭的没有群众的一股，事实上是张同志为了解决群众困难，领导群众搞了一个合作社。武委会入了二万元股金，群众四万七千元，还有罚的二石麦子作为群众生产股金，张同志也入了二万元股，但不全都是他的。
    二、稿中说张同志把罚的二石麦子偷卖了，罚的麦子是王竹林、王小的每人一石。由村农会主席刘兴成入到合作社，现还在合作社生产，并不是他偷卖了。
    三、张洪发（现任村长）四六年当村警，被蒋军抓着，威吓他去找武委会主任方盛信，他被逼无奈，曾引蒋军到了方盛信家，这是事实，但这是今年二月方盛信父亲和村农会副主席茹德谈的，张同志并不知道，稿上却说张同志怕斗了他，没人再当村长，就不让提意见，是冤枉了的。（河王村农会主席刘兴成、武委会主任吕时祯、贫雇农代表伊厂兴、农会常委何家训）
