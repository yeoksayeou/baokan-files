Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th: The People's Liberation Army on the Jinpu Front, following the recovery of Tai'an, Xintai, and Feicheng, recovered Dawenkou, an important station on the Jinpu Railway south of Tai'an, and Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, along with the city of Sishui to its east, on the 1st. The enemy troops guarding all three locations fled to Yanzhou on the Jinpu Railway. On May 31st, a unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Loude Town, thirty li north of Sishui city, capturing over 200 enemy guns. Another unit intercepted enemy troops retreating westward from Xintai, capturing over 40 enemy soldiers, with the remaining enemy also fleeing to Yanzhou. Thus, the entire area east of the Jinpu Railway in Shandong, with the exception of the three strongholds of Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai and their vicinity, and the southern parts of Yanzhou, Linyi, and areas south of them, has been completely recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th: A unit of our Ji Zhong local armed forces, on May 31st, with swift action, captured Shengfang City, a commercial hub 90 li southwest of Tianjin, eliminating over 200 bandits. This city was liberated from the Japanese invaders by us in the spring of 1945 but was twice occupied by the enemy; this is the second time it has been recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 6th: The People's Liberation Army once again recovered Huairen County seat in Yanbei on May 26th. On May 22nd, Yan's 38th Provisional Division and other units from Datong re-occupied Huairen in order to receive fleeing enemy troops from Yingxian. On the 26th, the enemy abandoned the city and fled. During the enemy's re-occupation of the city, over a hundred citizens went missing, and 42 bodies of murdered citizens were found in five wells in the city. The urban industrial and commercial sectors, which had been restored with the support of the democratic government, were once again looted. When the democratic government entered the city on the 26th, citizens flocked to the streets, denouncing the crimes of the Yan bandits. The municipal government is currently carrying out emergency relief efforts to appease the affected people.
