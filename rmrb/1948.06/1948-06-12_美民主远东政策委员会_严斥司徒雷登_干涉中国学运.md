Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 9th: According to a New York report on the 6th, the American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee recently sternly condemned Stuart for interfering in the Chinese student patriotic movement. On the 4th of this month, Stuart, under the order of the U.S. State Department, issued an extremely insulting written statement to the Chinese people, openly accusing and slandering the current patriotic movement of Chinese students against American imperialism's support of Japanese aggression in China as "wrong" and a "conspiracy," and demanded in a threatening tone that students stop this patriotic movement. The Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee announced that it had sent a telegram to Stuart protesting this statement. The telegram was signed by Russell, the executive director of the committee. The telegram stated: "As Americans who recognize the Chinese people's right to self-determination and oppose American interference in China's internal affairs, we are shocked that you (referring to Stuart) dare to tell Chinese students not to disagree with and agitate against American policies that affect China. The American ambassador's threat to Chinese students with 'unfortunate consequences' is exactly the same as the pre-war Japanese imperialists' attempt to stifle the Chinese people's patriotic movement. We are angry at our (referring to the United States) government's open collaboration with Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out terrorist suppression of students." The Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee declared that the telegram had reached the State Department in Washington, and the committee also requested the State Department to deny Stuart's remarks.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 9th: Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's commentary on the Chinese student patriotic democratic movement on May 30th, stating in brief: The Chinese student movement has been increasingly strengthened. The student unrest caused by the Kuomintang authorities' suppression of student organizations (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's order at the end of March to disband the North China Student Federation) has not completely subsided, and a new student unrest has broken out. The occurrence of this student unrest coincides with the anniversary of the May 20th incident last year when the Kuomintang bandits shot and killed peaceful demonstrating students in Nanjing. Its main slogan is to oppose the United States' support of Japanese aggressive forces threatening China. Students in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other cities have quickly become involved in this movement and are bravely struggling. The commentary then summarized the Kuomintang's persecution of the student movement over the past year and praised the Chinese youth's fearless patriotic spirit. The commentary pointed out: Over the past year, Chinese patriotic students have been subjected to persecution by the Kuomintang. According to materials recently published by the Shanghai Student Federation, in Shanghai alone, students have suffered various forms of persecution reaching 2,300 people in the past year, including 106 people seriously injured, 466 people arrested, and 667 people expelled from school. Currently, the Kuomintang is again using provocative tactics and directing its special agents disguised as "students" in various schools to carry out violent persecution against patriotic student masses. But all this cannot destroy the spirit of Chinese youth. Over the past year, the student patriotic movement has continued to develop, and the current patriotic movement against American support of Japan is expanding.

  　严斥司徒雷登　干涉中国学运
    【新华社陕北九日电】据纽约六日讯：美国民主远东政策委员会顷严斥司徒雷登干涉中国学生爱国运动。司徒于本月四日奉美国务院之命，发表一极端侮辱中国人民的书面声明，公然指责和诬蔑中国学生目前所进行的反对美帝扶植日本侵略中国的爱国运动为“错误”为“阴谋”，并以威胁口吻要求学生停止这一爱国运动。民主远东政策委员会宣布该会已致电司徒雷登，抗议此一声明，电报由该会执行主任罗素签名。电文称：“作为承认中国人民自决权利与反对美国干涉中国内政的美国人，我们为你（指司徒）胆敢告诉中国学生要他们对于影响中国的美国政策不要采取不同意和鼓动反对这一消息所震惊。美国大使以‘不幸后果’威胁中国学生，与战前日本帝国主义试图钳制中国人民的爱国运动是一模一样的，对于我国（指美国）政府公然协同蒋介石对学生进行恐怖镇压，我们感到愤怒。”民主远东政策委会宣称：该电文已到达华盛顿国务院，该委员会并要求国务院否认司徒雷登的谈话。
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科电台五月三十日广播马西努对中国学生爱国民主运动的评论，略称：中国学生运动已日益加强，由于国民党当局压迫学生组织（按指三月底蒋匪下令解散华北学联）所引起的学潮还未完全平息，新的学潮又爆发了。这次学潮的发生，正当去年五月二十日国民党在南京枪杀和平示威学生事件周年纪念日的时候，它的主要口号是反对美国扶植日本侵略势力威胁中国。南京、上海及其他城市学生，已迅速卷入这一运动，勇敢进行斗争。该评论继即综述过去一年来国民党迫害学生运动的经过，并盛赞中国青年大无畏的爱国精神。评论指出：一年来中国爱国学生备受国民党的迫害。据上海学联最近发表的材料，过去一年仅上海一地，学生遭受各种迫害的就有二千三百人，其中有一百零六人受重伤，四百六十六人被捕，六百六十七人被开除学籍。目前国民党又采用挑拨手段和指使其在各学校的特务“学生”，对爱国学生群众施行暴力迫害。但这一切并不能摧毁中国青年的精神，一年以来学生爱国运动继续向前发展，目前的反对美国扶植日本的爱国运动正日益扩大。
