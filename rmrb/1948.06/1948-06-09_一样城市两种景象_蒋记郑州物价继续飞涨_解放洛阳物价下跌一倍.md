Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 6th. According to merchants who recently fled from Zhengzhou to Luoyang: In Zhengzhou under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the market is becoming increasingly depressed, and prices are soaring, making it impossible for citizens to live. Stores are closing, and more and more merchants are fleeing. Oppressive taxes are heavier than ever. For example, a third-class small stationery store was once assessed as much as 60 to 70 million yuan (Chiang currency, same below). Comparing Zhengzhou's prices with those of Luoyang, which was liberated not long ago, many necessities are almost twice as expensive as in Luoyang. On the 11th of last month, wheat in Zhengzhou was 450,000 yuan per dou, white flour was 40,000 yuan per jin, and cotton was 180,000 yuan per jin. On the 14th, Luoyang's prices were 280,000 yuan per dou for wheat (also valued in Chiang currency), 28,000 yuan per jin for white flour, and 160,000 yuan for cotton.

　　一样城市两种景象
    蒋记郑州物价继续飞涨
  　解放洛阳物价下跌一倍
    【新华社洛阳六日电】据近日从郑州逃回洛阳的商人谈称：在蒋匪统治下的郑州，市面日益萧条，物价暴涨不已，市民已无法生活。商店关门，商人外逃者越来越多，苛捐杂税比任何时候都重。如某家三等小文具店，一次派款即达六七千万元（蒋币下同）。如以郑州物价与刚解放不久的洛阳相比较，很多生活必需品几乎高过洛阳一倍。上月十一日，郑州麦子每斗四十五万元，白面每斤四万元，棉花每斤十八万元，而洛阳十四日物价则为麦每斗二十八万元（亦按蒋币计值），白面每斤二万八千元，棉花十六万元。
