　　The Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area
  　Acting as an Inaugural Editorial
    The two major liberated areas of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji have now been merged into a unified North China Liberated Area. These two major liberated areas are adjacent in terms of mountains and rivers, and are largely similar in terms of politics, economy, culture, history, and the customs and habits of the people. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were subjected to military division by the Japanese and puppet regimes; after the Japanese surrender, they were again subjected to military division by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and had to be divided into two independent liberated areas and many smaller independent units. This division was extremely detrimental to the people's political, economic, cultural life and construction. Now, thanks to the continuous victories of the People's Liberation War, the situation in North China has undergone fundamental changes, and the two major liberated areas have been completely connected. The unification and merger of the two regions is not only necessary, but also entirely possible. Therefore, the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau and the two military regions, under the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the Revolutionary Military Commission, have been merged into the CCP North China Central Bureau and the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the two border region governments are also working together in joint offices and are preparing to quickly convene the people's representative organs of the two regions to discuss the steps and methods for complete merger. From now on, all work in the two liberated areas will be carried out under a completely unified leadership and plan. This will not only be of great benefit to the future political, economic, and cultural life of the people of North China, but will also be of great benefit to mobilizing and organizing the 44 million people of North China into a unified force to more effectively support the national people's liberation war.
    The establishment of the North China Liberated Area is only the merger of the two major liberated areas of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu. It is in a fraternal relationship with the major liberated areas of Northeast, Northwest, East China, and Central Plains, but its position is to connect other fraternal liberated areas and become the center of the liberated areas. Therefore, its position is strategically particularly important. Therefore, the merger of the two liberated areas will undoubtedly have a positive impact on other fraternal liberated areas. However, today, it and its fraternal liberated areas are still temporarily divided by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang militarily, and cannot achieve complete unification of the liberated areas nationwide. However, we firmly believe that in the near future, under the conditions of further victories by the People's Liberation Army, the military division by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will be continuously and rapidly shattered, and the complete unification of the liberated areas nationwide will not be far off. We eagerly look forward to and will make every effort to promote the early arrival of this period.
    The North China Liberated Area has a vast territory and abundant resources. Today, it has 44 million liberated people. Within its jurisdiction, there are 165 million mu of arable land, 279 counties, 12 cities, and more than one million tempered Communist Party members and hundreds of thousands of brave and battle-tested North China People's Liberation Army soldiers. Its basic areas are old base areas that have been tempered by eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and nearly two years of civil war. The people have implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, reasonable burdens, and democratic political training. After the Japanese surrender, land reform was widely carried out, and the principle of "land to the tiller" was realized. Therefore, the people have a relatively high level of political awareness. The people's will to oppose imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is unwavering. This means that the internal conditions of the North China Liberated Area are very favorable. And the external, i.e., surrounding conditions, are also very good. It is located in the center of the various liberated areas, and powerful fraternal liberation armies are launching offensives against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army on the battlefields of Northeast, Northwest, Central Plains, and East China. They have not only shattered Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to penetrate the war into the interior of the liberated areas in order to destroy the liberated areas, but also developed the liberation war to the Chiang-controlled areas, turning the Chiang-controlled areas into new liberated areas. This has given the basic areas of North China a relatively stable environment and conditions. Therefore, it is possible to carry out various construction tasks here in a more planned and step-by-step manner. Obviously, the acquisition of this environment and conditions is not easy, it is very precious, and it is the result of a long period of bloody struggle. Directly, it naturally relies on the long-term arduous struggle of the Party, government, army, and people in the North China Liberated Area over the past ten years, but from a general perspective, it is mainly the result of the joint struggle of the entire People's Liberation Army and the people of the liberated areas nationwide. Imagine, without the heroic battles of other fraternal liberated areas and liberation armies, especially the field armies, it would be impossible to obtain and maintain this environment in the North China Liberated Area. Therefore, the people of North China should express their deep gratitude and respect to the people of other fraternal liberated areas and their liberation armies, and be prepared to make full and effective use of this relatively stable environment and conditions without any relaxation, to quickly restore and develop production, and carry out all possible and necessary construction, in order to continue to provide the people and armies of other fraternal liberated areas with the greatest possible support. The people of North China will understand: Supporting them is supporting us, the people of North China.
    Under these relatively consolidated and relatively stable conditions, what should be the tasks and work guidelines of the North China Liberated Area? In addition to continuing to mobilize the people in the areas bordering the enemy and the guerrilla areas to carry out a resolute military struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang, and to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to resolutely eliminate the Kuomintang bandit army, expand the liberated area and even completely liberate the countryside and cities of North China, in all basic areas, it is necessary to quickly carry out restoration and construction, in order to more effectively support the national liberation war and improve the lives of the people of North China. And all kinds of restoration and construction work must be centered on the restoration and development of agricultural and industrial production, in order to strive for the rapid improvement of the production of the people of North China on the existing level. All land reform and party rectification work in the basic areas, as well as the construction of democratic governments and people's organizations, should take this as the only central goal. This is the basic task and work guideline of the basic liberated area of North China. In order to achieve this basic task, the following specific tasks must be carried out:
    (1) We must make great efforts to restore and develop agricultural production. At present, the feudal and semi-feudal system has been completely eliminated in most areas within the North China Liberated Area, and the landless and land-poor peasants have been allocated their due share of land. In these areas, the basic direction of rural work should shift from land reform to uniting people from all walks of life to fully restore and develop production. In areas where land reform has not yet been finally completed, it is of course still necessary to carry out partial land adjustments at appropriate times, but equally, the focus of work must be placed on production, leading people from all walks of life to actively produce on the existing land and ensuring that whoever sows reaps. In order to enable people from all walks of life in rural areas to stably and confidently increase production, land rights should be determined without hesitation, land certificates should be issued, and the land property obtained by people from all walks of life in land reform, as well as the property obtained from future production, should be effectively protected by law from infringement; the past progressive agricultural tax regulations that are no longer applicable should be abolished, and new agricultural tax regulations and other burden standards should be formulated and promulgated quickly; in addition, in the rear, appropriate streamlining of troops and simplification of administration should be implemented, and war service methods should be improved, in order to adjust and appropriately reduce the people's labor, material, and financial burdens; in addition to this, great efforts must be made to develop farmers' mutual aid organizations on a large scale, based on the two basic principles of voluntary participation and equivalent exchange, which must be observed and cannot be violated, and to organize the broad masses of women to participate in production. At the same time, agricultural production loans should be issued as much as possible and loan methods should be effectively improved to increase agricultural production tools, livestock, fertilizer, and water conservancy projects.
    (2) We must make great efforts to restore and develop industrial production in the basic areas. Democratic governments and Party committees above the county level should place the task of increasing industrial production on an equally important position as the task of increasing agricultural production, and not only focus on increasing agricultural production. All machine industries, handicraft industries, household sideline industries, and various transportation businesses that can and can be restored and constructed, and that are needed for people's lives and war, must be restored and constructed with all efforts, with the focus on the most important enterprises. To this end, it is necessary to quickly improve the operation and management methods of public enterprises, correct the policies of the workers' movement, stipulate progressive wage systems and levels that can stimulate production development, taking into account both public and private interests and both labor and capital, consolidate industrial and commercial taxes, plan the allocation of raw materials, sell finished products, and guarantee the supply of necessities for the lives of workers and staff, abolish all unnecessary controls, stabilize finance, implement correct import and export plans, and issue all necessary industrial and commercial loans as much as possible.
    (3) In order to ensure that people of all classes can stably carry out production and various nutrition, it is necessary to establish and ensure a stable social order and establish regular and fixed working systems for democratic governments, Party, people's organizations, and economic and cultural organs. To this end, it is necessary to establish people's representative conferences at all levels as power organs at all levels, first of all, people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village (township) levels, and elect government committees at all levels by the people's representative conferences at all levels; within the government committees at all levels, it is necessary to establish appropriate division of labor systems, establish people's supervisory organs that can prevent and oppose bureaucratization among public officials, and establish people's judicial organs and public security organs that can ensure social order and protect the people's public and private property. To this end, it is necessary to formulate the organizational law of people's representative conferences at all levels and democratic governments at all levels, as well as other laws and regulations. To this end, it is necessary to prepare for the election and convocation of the All-Area People's Congress of the North China Liberated Area. To this end, it is necessary to appropriately reduce local power, eliminate certain serious states of indiscipline or anarchy that exist in our work, overcome localism and empiricism among some cadres, and concentrate all our policies and the decision-making power of all important issues completely in the unified leading organ. To this end, it is necessary to further improve our Party, the leadership organs and cadres and Party members at all levels of the Party and the people, especially the connection with the working people, it is necessary to continue to complete the Party rectification work, and continue to overcome the serious phenomenon of impure Party composition, especially impure style. This Party rectification work has been extremely effective since it began last year, and the serious phenomenon of impurity within the Party has been greatly overcome, but because some deviations have occurred in the Party rectification work in some places, and the time is still very short, there is still much work that must be carried out in the Party rectification, especially the work of rectifying rural branches and organ and factory branches, that has not been completed. In the future, it is necessary to correct the deviations in the past Party rectification and completely and correctly complete these tasks, in order to unite the entire Party and the entire army like one person after distinguishing right from wrong within the Party, and serve the people wholeheartedly, and lead all the people to advance victoriously.
    (4) In order to ensure the smooth progress of the above-mentioned tasks and promote the rapid victory of the revolutionary war in North China and throughout China, it is necessary to strengthen the military struggle in North China, and strengthen the support of field armies and the people on other fronts in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. For this purpose, the combat effectiveness of the North China Field Army must continue to be improved, so that it can not only carry out mobile warfare, continue to annihilate the military forces of Chiang Kai-shek, Fu Zuoyi, and Yan Xishan, and recover the vast countryside of North China, but also carry out positional warfare, cooperate with the forces of other fraternal liberated areas, liberate all large and small cities in North China, and then further liberate the countryside and cities throughout the country. For this purpose, it is necessary to plan to collect the manpower, materials, and financial resources of North China, and plan to use these manpower, materials, and financial resources efficiently and effectively to the front lines of North China, the Central Plains, and the Northwest. This is the most glorious and greatest historical task of our Party in North China, the democratic government in North China, the People's Liberation Army in North China, and the people of North China. The people of all China and our descendants who will inevitably live a happy life in the future will deeply thank and forever commemorate the great efforts and major sacrifices of the people of North China today.
    These are the basic guidelines and specific tasks of the two major liberated areas after the merger, that is, the North China Liberated Area. It is believed that the Communist Party members and cadres in North China who have been tempered by the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the two years of civil war, under the leadership of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, will be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and be diligent and thrifty, and work together with the 44 million people of North China to complete these tasks 100%. Although we are still at the most tense juncture of the Chinese revolutionary war, the great work of building a new democratic country has already begun partially here. Celebrate the merger of the two major liberated areas and the establishment of the North China Liberated Area! Long live the construction of a new democratic country!

　　华北解放区的当前任务
  　代创刊词
    晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两大解放区现已合并为一个统一的华北解放区。这两大解放区，山川毗连，政治、经济、文化、历史及人民的风俗习惯，均大体相同。在抗日期间，遭受日伪的军事分割；日本投降后，又遭受蒋介石匪帮的军事分割，曾不得不分为两个独立的解放区及许多更小的独立单位。这种分割，对于人民的政治、经济、文化的生活和建设，都是十分不利的。现在，由于人民解放战争的不断胜利，华北形势已经发生了根本变化，两大解放区已完全联成一片。两区的统一合并，不但需要，而且是完全可能的了。因此，中共晋冀鲁豫中央局和晋察冀中央局及两个军区，在中共中央及革命军事委员会的指示下，已合并为中共华北中央局与中国人民解放军华北军区。同时，两个边区政府亦实行联合办公，并准备迅速召集两区人民代表机关，商讨完全合并的步骤和方法。从此，两个解放区的一切工作，均将在一个完全统一的领导和计划之下进行。这不独对于华北人民今后的政治、经济、文化生活有极大利益，而且对于动员与组织华北四千四百万人民成为统一的力量，更有效地去支援全国人民的解放战争，亦将有极大的利益。
    华北解放区的成立，还只是晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区的合并，它与东北、西北、华东、中原各大解放区处于兄弟的地位，但它在地位上是联系其他各兄弟解放区而成为各解放区的中心。故它的地位，在战略上就特别显得重要。所以两个解放区的合并，对其他各兄弟解放区，无疑的亦将发生有利的影响。但是，在今天，它和各兄弟解放区暂时还受到蒋介石匪帮的军事分割，还不能实行全国各解放区的完全统一。然而，我们坚信，在最近的将来，在人民解放军进一步胜利的条件之下，蒋介石匪帮的军事分割是要不断地迅速地被粉碎的，全国各解放区的完全统一，亦将为期不远了。我们热烈地盼望，并将尽一切努力促进这个时期的早日到来。
    华北解放区，幅员广大，物产丰富，今天已有四千四百万被解放了的人民，在它的辖境内有一万六千五百万亩可耕土地，有二百七十九个县，十二个市，有一百万以上经过锻炼的共产党员与几十万勇敢善战的华北人民解放军；它的基本地区，乃是经过八年抗战又经过将近两年内战锻炼的老根据地，人民曾经实行过减租减息、合理负担和民主的政治训练。在日本投降后，又普遍地进行过土地改革，实现了耕者有其田，因此，人民就有了相当高的政治觉悟。人民反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义及彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮的意志是坚定不移的。这就是说：华北解放区的内部条件，是十分优越的。而外部的，即周围的条件，也十分好。它处于各个解放区的中心，四面都有强大的兄弟解放军正在东北、西北、中原与华东各个战场上，向蒋介石匪军实行进攻，他们不但粉碎了蒋介石企图把战争深入到解放区内部，以便破坏解放区的阴谋，而且把解放战争发展到了蒋管区，把蒋管区变为新的解放区。这就使得华北解放区的基本地区，获得了相对安定的环境和条件。因此，在这里，也就可能比较有计划地、有步骤地去进行各种建设工作。显然，这种环境与条件的获得，是不容易的，是十分值得宝贵的，是经过了长期流血斗争的结果。直接的自然是依靠华北解放区内部党政军民十年来的长期艰苦奋斗，但从总的方面来说，主要的乃是全体解放军和全国各解放区人民共同奋斗的结果。试想，如果没有其他各兄弟解放区和解放军，特别是野战军的英勇作战，华北解放区这种环境的取得与保持，乃是不可能的。因此，我华北人民应该向其他各兄弟解放区的人民及其解放军表示深深的感谢和敬意，并准备毫不放松地十分有效地利用这种比较安定的环境和条件，迅速恢复和发展生产，进行各种可能的与必要的建设，以便继续给各兄弟解放区的人民和军队以最大可能的支援。华北的人民是会懂得：支援他们就是支持我们华北人民自己。
    在这样比较巩固、比较安定的条件下，华北解放区的任务与工作方针，应该是什么呢？除开在接敌区游击区继续动员人民向国民党匪帮进行坚决的军事斗争，并配合人民解放军坚决消灭国民党匪军，扩大解放区以至完全解放华北的乡村和城市而外，在一切基本地区，则是要迅速地进行恢复和建设，以便更有力地支援全国的解放战争和改善华北人民生活。而各种恢复与建设工作，又须以恢复与发展农业和工业生产为中心，以便争取华北人民的生产能够在现有的水平上迅速提高一寸。一切基本区的土改与整党工作及关于民主政府与人民团体的建设工作，均应以此为唯一的中心目标。这就是华北基本解放区的基本任务与工作方针。为了实现这一个基本任务，就必须进行下列各项具体工作：
    （一）必须用极大的努力去恢复与发展农业生产。目前，华北解放区内部的大部地区，封建与半封建制度已经彻底消灭，无地少地农民已分得应有的一份土地。在这些地区，农村工作的基本方向，应该从土地改革方面转到团结各阶层人民全力恢复与发展生产方面去。在土地改革尚未最后完成的地区，当然还有必要在适当时机实行局部的土地调剂，但同样也要把工作中心放在生产上面去，领导各阶层人民在现有土地上，积极生产，保证谁种谁收。为了使农村各阶层人民安定地并且是有信心地去提高生产，就应毫不迟疑地确定地权，颁发土地证，并用法律切实保障各阶层人民在土地改革中所分得的土地财产，以及今后生产所得的财产，不受侵犯；就应废除已经不适用了的过去的农业累进税则，迅速制定并公布新的农业税则及其他负担标准；就应在后方实行适当的精兵简政，并改善战勤办法，以调整与适当地减轻人民的人力物力与财力负担；除此以外，还必须用极大的努力在自愿与等价交换这两项必须遵守而不可违反的基本原则上，去大量发展农民的生产互助组织，并组织广大妇女群众去参加生产。同时要尽可能地发放农业生产贷款并切实改善贷款方法，以增加农业生产工具、牲畜和肥料及兴修水利等。
    （二）必须用极大的努力去恢复与发展基本区的工业生产。县以上的民主政府和党委，应将提高工业生产的任务与提高农业生产的任务摆在同等重要的地位，而不仅是以提高农业生产为重心。所有一切可以和能够恢复与建设、又为人民生活与战争所需要的机器工业、手工工业、家庭副业及各种运输事业，均必须尽一切努力去恢复和建设，而将重点放在那些最重要的企业上。为此，就必须迅速改善公营企业的经营管理方法，端正职工运动的政策，规定公私兼顾及劳资两利能够刺激生产发展的进步的工资制度和等级，整理工商业税，有计划地分配原料，推销成品，并保障职工生活必需品的供给，废除一切不必要的统制，稳定金融，实行正确的出进口计划，并尽可能发放一切必要的工商业贷款。
    （三）为了保障各阶级人民安定地进行生产和各种营养，建立与保障安定的社会秩序和建立民主政府的、党的、人民团体的及经济文化机关的经常的一定的工作制度、乃是十分必要的。为此，就必须建立作为各级权力机关的各级人民代表会议，首先是县、区、村（乡）人民代表会议，并由各级人民代表会议选举各级政府委员会；在各级政府委员会内部又建立适当的分工制度，建立能够防止与反对公务人员中官僚主义化的人民监察机关，建立能够保障社会秩序安定及人民公私财产的人民司法机关及公安机关。为此，就必须制订各级人民代表会议及各级民主政府的组织法及其他各种法律及条例。为此就必须筹备选举和召集华北解放区的全区人民代表大会。为此，就必须适当地缩小地方权力，肃清存在于我们工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态，克服某些干部中的地方主义与经验主义，使我们各方面的政策及一切重要问题的决定权，完全集中于统一的领导机关。为此，就必须进一步改善我们党，各级党的领导机关及干部和党员与人民，特别是与劳动人民的联系，就必须继续完成整党工作，继续克服党内成份不纯，特别是作风不纯的严重现象。这种整党工作从去年开始以来，已有极大的成效，党内不纯的严重现象，已有很大的克服，但因为在某些地方的整党工作中发生了若干偏差，并且时间还很短，所以还有许多在整党中所必须进行的工作，特别是整理农村支部及机关与工厂支部的工作，还没有作完。今后必须纠正过去整党中的偏差，完全正确地去完成这些工作，以便在党内分清是非善恶之后，团结全党全军象一个人一样，全心全意地去为人民服务，并领导着全体人民胜利地前进。
    （四）为了保障上述各项工作的顺利进行，并促进革命战争在华北及在全中国的迅速胜利，必须加强华北的军事斗争，并在人力、物力、财力上加强支援其他战线的野战军和人民。为了这个目的，华北野战军的战斗力必须继续提高，以便不只是能够进行运动战，继续歼灭蒋介石、傅作义、阎锡山的军事力量，收复华北广大的乡村，而且能够进行阵地战，配合各兄弟解放区的力量，解放华北的一切大小城市，然后，再进而去解放全国各地的乡村和城市。为了这个目的，就必须有计划地征集华北的人力、物力和财力，并且有计划地有效率地使用这些人力、物力、财力到华北的、中原的及西北的前线上去。这就是我们华北的党，华北的民主政府，华北的人民解放军和华北的人民最光荣最伟大的历史任务。全中国人民和将来必然幸福生活的我们的后代，对今天华北人民的巨大努力与重大牺牲，均将寄以深深的感谢和永远的纪念。
    这就是两大解放区在合并以后的，即华北解放区的基本方针和具体任务。相信我们经过了八年抗战和两年内战锻炼的，在我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志和党中央领导下的华北的共产党员和干部，必将谦虚谨慎、戒骄戒燥并且是克勤克俭地和华北四千四百万人民一起，去百分之百的完成这些任务的。虽然我们还处在中国革命战争的最紧张的关头，但是伟大的新民主主义的国家建设工作，就已经在我们这里部分地开始了。庆祝两大解放区的合并及华北解放区的成立！新民主主义的国家建设工作万岁！
