Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 21st: TASS, Moscow, June 17th: The governments of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the United States, and France have recently reached an agreement to hold a conference on the Danube River issue in the capital of one of the Danube River countries on July 30th; and agreed that the United Kingdom will participate in a consultative capacity. The convening of this conference is based on the decision of the New York Foreign Ministers Conference on December 12, 1946. At the meeting on July 30, representatives of the Danube countries—the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary—and representatives of the member states of the Foreign Ministers Conference—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—will discuss the issue of establishing a new convention on Danube River navigation. Note: The issue of Danube River navigation management is originally an internal matter of the Danube River countries. When the Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France discussed the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland in 1946, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom suddenly requested that the Foreign Ministers Conference and the Danube River basin countries (including Germany) jointly discuss this issue, that is, non-Danube River countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and France could also interfere in this issue. The purpose, as the Pravda commentary said, was to "attempt to turn the Danube River issue into a tool for international gambling," and was therefore rejected by the Soviet representative. The Soviet Union at that time advocated that this issue could be resolved by the Danube River basin countries themselves. At the end of 1946, when the New York Foreign Ministers Conference reached an agreement on the main issues of the five-nation peace treaties, the issue of the Danube River conference also reached the aforementioned decision. The Danube River is 2,860 kilometers long, traversing Central Europe with more than 300 tributaries. The main stream of the Danube River flows from southern Germany through southern Czechia, northern Austria, central Hungary, northern Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and southern Romania and Moldavia, into the Black Sea, serving as the main inland waterway for Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

　　苏英美法获协议
  　七月底开多瑙河会议
  　讨论订立航运新公约
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：苏英美法四国政府之间顷已获致协议，同意于七月三十日在多瑙河各国之一的首都举行多瑙河问题会议；并同意英国以咨询资格参加。此一会议之召集，系根据一九四六年十二月十二日纽约外长会议的决定。七月三十日的会议中，苏联、乌克兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克、南斯拉夫、匈牙利等多瑙河国家之代表及外长会议会员国——苏美英法之代表，将讨论订立多瑙河航运新公约问题。按：多瑙河航运管理问题，本系多瑙河各国之内部问题。当一九四六年苏美英法外长会议讨论意罗保匈芬和约时，美英代表突然要求由外长会议及多瑙河流域各国（包括德国）共同讨论此一问题的建议，亦即非多瑙河国的英美法也得以干涉这一问题，其目的，如真理报的评论所说，是“企图将多瑙河问题变为国际赌博中的工具”，因而遭到苏联代表的拒绝，苏联当时主张此一问题可由多瑙河流域各国自行解决。一九四六年底，当纽约外长会议在五国和约的各项主要问题上获致协议时，多瑙河会议问题亦获致前述决定。多瑙河全长二千八百六十公里，横贯中欧，支流达三百余。多瑙河主流自德国南部经捷克南部、奥地利北部、匈牙利中部、南斯拉夫和保加利亚北部、罗马尼亚和摩达维亚南部，流入黑海，为东欧及东南欧的主要内陆水运线。
