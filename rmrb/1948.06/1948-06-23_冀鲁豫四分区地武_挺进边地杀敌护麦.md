  　Advance to Border Areas to Kill Enemies and Protect Wheat
    [News from Hebei-Shandong-Henan] The local armed forces of the Fourth Military Subdistrict are actively carrying out the struggle to protect grain. During the wheat harvest, Wang Sanzhu's puppet bandit troops and puppet town governments frantically seized wheat in the border areas of our Fourth Military Subdistrict. Our subdistrict's armed forces have advanced to various border areas to actively strike at the enemy. Comrade Liu Zhenbang, secretary of the Weinan County Party Committee, personally led a large detachment to operate in the border areas. On May 23, a certain regiment of our local armed forces ambushed the enemy at Juqiao. When the enemy's vanguard discovered this, they fled in disarray. Our army pursued them closely and captured one light machine gun. On May 26, a certain regiment of ours annihilated the enemy who were out robbing wheat in Hexi Tongshan and Beishan areas, capturing 32 enemy soldiers, killing and wounding 4 enemy soldiers, seizing 1 light machine gun, 43 rifles, 1,917 rounds of ammunition, 2 grenade launchers, and 160,000 yuan in puppet currency. Two regiments of Wang Sanzhu's puppet bandit troops came to our Shadian and Guandian areas to rob wheat. Our county detachment rushed to intercept them, preventing the enemy from advancing further, and they retreated that evening. On June 8, over a hundred enemies came to rob wheat from four Cao Tan (grass beach) areas in our Fifth District. The Fifth District's Armed Work Team rushed to meet them upon hearing the news. Except for a portion of wheat robbed by the enemy from Liu Cao Tan, the rest of the enemy were repelled by us, and two or three Cao Tan areas suffered no losses. Currently, our local armed forces are still actively operating in the border areas, protecting the masses in storing grain and planting summer crops.
