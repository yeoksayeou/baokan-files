Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: According to delayed news from Shanghai: The Shanghai economic circles held a forum at the end of March on the theme of "The Actual Difficulties of Current Industry and Commerce." National capitalists expressed extreme indignation and hatred towards Chiang Kai-shek's policies of indiscriminately issuing currency, heavy taxes, and monopolistic controls, which strangled national industry. They bitterly accused that the malignant inflation of currency was increasingly confiscating their inherent capital, making it impossible for them to maintain simple reproduction. Hu Shuchang, manager of the Cooperative Hardware Factory, said: "The selling price obtained from ordering to delivering goods is far less than the cost, and it is impossible to buy raw materials again. There is no profit at all, but the machinery industry can only order goods, what can be done?" Xu Zixin, general manager of Hanyang Handkerchief Factory, said: "If our manufacturers sell goods today, they will not be able to buy the same amount of raw materials needed tomorrow. Therefore, many factories have already reduced or stopped work. As far as I know, factories in the Xujiahui area have completely stopped night work, and day work has generally reduced by 30 percent." Regarding the taxes levied by the Chiang Kai-shek government, he cited an example: "Taking a piece of yarn as an example, the stamp tax before the war was six cents, but now it has to pay 140,000 yuan, which is almost 900 times, far exceeding the multiple of general prices." Chu Shangyi, manager of Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory, angrily said about Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "six-fold advance payment method for the 37th year income tax": "The 37th year should normally collect the income tax of the 36th year. Now, for financial purposes, the income tax of the 37th year is forcibly paid at six times last year's amount. What is this! The business of the 36th year is one thing, and the business of the 37th year is another!" He particularly emphasized: "Now it is not a question of six times or not, but a question of deliberately killing industry and commerce." Sheng Kangnian, manager of Aimeike Pharmaceutical Factory, also believed that with six times the advance payment, a factory with 20 million yuan of capital would often have to bear more than 100 million yuan. He also pointed out the tragic situation suffered by the industry under Chiang Kai-shek's government's cruel strangulation policy: "Among the peers in this industry, there were 600 in the era of enemy and puppet regimes, and now there are only about 30. More than 95 percent of them lost money last year." The Chiang Kai-shek authorities' monopoly and control, manipulating the market, caused even more severe blows to private industrial and commercial enterprises. Regarding the Chiang Kai-shek's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee and the China Textile Corporation's control of raw cotton, Xu Zixin said: "Among our peers, less than 1.2 percent currently have three months of raw material inventory." Yan Yaoqiu, general manager of Shanghai Machine Factory, believed: "If this continues, one day the managers will be forced to flee." Sun Xiaocun, deputy general manager of Xinghua Tea Company, believed that the Chiang Kai-shek government's so-called "control" was like encouraging the "eating-up movement." He explained these control agencies of the Chiang Kai-shek government: "Four Banks, Two Bureaus, Four Joint Offices, the Financial Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the Import and Export Control Committee, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Executive Yuan, there are more than a dozen large and small. For every request, you have to burn incense at all ten major temples, and when you are exhausted from running around, the result is still nothing. They (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) cannot produce good articles." Finally, the national industrialists all believed: "In order to survive, we must strengthen unity, oppose control, etc., and then we can save and protect ourselves."

　　上海民族资本家沉痛控诉：
    蒋匪滥发纸币苛杂繁重  使民族工业不能再生产
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据迟到之上海消息：沪市经济界于三月底以“当前工商业的实际困难”为题，召开座谈会。民族资本家们对蒋匪滥发通货，繁重的苛捐杂税，及垄断统制等项扼杀民族工业的政策，均表示极度愤慨与憎恨。他们沉痛控诉通货的恶性膨胀是日益加厉地在没收着他们的固有资本，使他们无法维持单纯再生产。合作五金厂经理胡叔常说：“自订货到交货所得的售价，远赶不上成本，而且再也买不进原料，利润根本谈不上，但是机器业只能订货，这有什么办法呢？”汉阳手帕厂总经理许资新说：“我们厂家今天卖出货去，明日就买不进所需同等数量的原料，因此很多工厂现已在减工停工了。以我所晓得的来说，徐家汇一带厂家，夜工现已全停止，日工一般的减少百分之三十。”对蒋匪政府所征收的捐税，他举例说：“以一件纱来说，战前纳印花税六分，而现在却要缴十四万元，差不多达到九百倍，已远超出一般物价的倍数。”启明染织厂经理褚尚一对蒋匪政府的所谓“三十七年度所得税六倍借缴办法”激愤地说：“三十七年度照例是收三十六年的所得税，现在为了财政目的，硬叫三十七年度的所得税先以去年的六倍缴，这成什么话！卅六年度的营业是一回事，卅七年度的营业又是一回事！”他特别强调指出：“现在已不是六倍不六倍的问题，而是存心杀害工商业的问题。”爱美科制药厂经理盛康年也认为六倍借缴，二千万元资本的厂家，往往就要负担到一亿以上。他并指出在蒋匪政府这种残酷的绞杀政策下，该业所遭受的惨况：“本业同行，在敌伪时代有六百家，现在只有三十家左右。去年有百分之九十五以上是亏本。”蒋匪当局的垄断统制，操纵市场，更使民营工商业遭受惨重的打击。对蒋匪花纱布管理委员会及中纺的统制原棉，许资新说：“我们同业各单位，现在有三个月原料存量的不到百分之一点二。”上海机器厂总经理颜耀秋认为：“这样维持下去，终有一天会逼得当经理的只好逃亡的。”兴华制茶公司副总经理孙晓村则认为蒋匪政府的所谓“管制”，正象奖励“吃光运动”。他解释蒋匪政府的这些管制机关：“四行、二局、四联总处、财政部金融管理局、输出入管制委员会、还有经济部、行政院大大小小有十数个之多，凡有所请求，十大庙非处处烧香不可，等到你奔走得精疲力竭，但结果还是一点没有。他们（指蒋匪）做不出好文章来。”最后，民族工业家们均认为：“为了生存，只有加紧团结，反对管制等，然后方能自救自保。”
