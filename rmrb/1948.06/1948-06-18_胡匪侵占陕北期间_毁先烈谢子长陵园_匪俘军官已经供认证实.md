Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 15th. During the occupation of Wayaobao (the location of Zichang County Government) in northern Shaanxi last year by the Hu Zongnan bandit troops, they destroyed the cemetery of the revolutionary martyr Xie Zichang and burned the coffin. This crime has been confessed to by Zeng Wensi, Chief of Staff of the 90th Division of the Hu army, and Mai Zongyu, Brigade Commander of the 135th Brigade, who have laid down their weapons. The Zichang Cemetery is located outside the east gate of Washi. After the Hu bandits occupied Wayaobao on April 3rd last year, the cemetery was repeatedly damaged. According to Zeng Wensi: "We arrived in Washi on April 3rd last year. Our troops were stationed at Qijiawan outside the east gate. I went to visit the cemetery with Division Commander Chen Wu (Note: The original Division Commander of the 90th Division was Yan Ming, who was killed by our troops in the Yichuan Campaign in March of this year; Chen was acting as the commander at the time - Editor) and Political Department Director Qin Huaixi. We were surprised to see the solemn and magnificent scale of the cemetery. The next day, Qin Huaixi destroyed the cemetery and other furnishings. At the lunch table on the same day, Chen Wu decided to completely destroy the cemetery. He asked me to notify the directly subordinate troops by telephone to carry it out at the cemetery that afternoon. The three of us went to the cemetery to direct the operation. We removed the stone tablets and inscriptions by the leaders of the CPC Central Committee. Chen Wu also ordered the troops to open the cemetery gate, carry out the coffin, and set it on fire." On April 4th, the Second Battalion of the 405th Regiment of the 135th Brigade demolished ten meters of the east wall of the cemetery while building fortifications outside the east gate, and all the wood of the pavilion was taken away. This section of the cemetery destruction has also been confirmed by the confessions of Mai Zongyu, Brigade Commander of the 135th Brigade, Wang Wenzhi, Director of the Newsroom of the Brigade, and Cheng Yaohuang, Commander of the 405th Regiment.

　　胡匪侵占陕北期间
  　毁先烈谢子长陵园
  　匪俘军官已经供认证实
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】胡宗南匪部去年侵占陕北瓦窑堡（子长县政府所在地）时，破坏了革命先烈谢子长陵园，并焚毁了棺本，此一罪行已为放下武器的胡军九十师参谋长曾文思及一三五旅旅长麦宗禹等所供认。子长陵位于瓦市东门外，去年四月三日，胡匪侵占瓦窑堡后，陵园即迭被破坏。据曾文思称：“我们去年四月三日到瓦市，所部宿营东门外祁家湾，我与师长陈武（按九十师师长原为今年三月宜川战役中被我击毙的严明，当时由陈代理——编者）政治部主任秦怀玺同去陵园参观，见陵园规模庄严宏伟，不胜惊讶。次日即由秦怀玺将陵园及其他陈设品捣毁，同日午餐席上，陈武决心将陵园完全破坏，要我以电话通知直属部队即日下午到陵园执行，我们三人同去陵园指挥，将石碑、及中共中央各首长之题词拔去，陈武并命令部队打开陵门，抬出棺木举火焚毁”。四月四日，一三五旅四零五团第二营在东门外修工事，又将陵园东面围墙拆毁十公尺，亭阁木料全被拆走，此一段毁陵经过，亦已由一三五旅旅长麦宗禹、该旅新闻室主任王文之、四零五团团长成耀煌等口供证实。
