　　【Taihang News】 Labor Heroes of Pingshun County Hold Meeting for Self-Criticism: Leaders of Production Must Proceed from Reality
　　The Pingshun County government convened a meeting of over seventy labor heroes and technical experts at the beginning of this month to review various problems in the organization, leadership, and technical guidance of past production, and to study future approaches. Taihang labor hero Li Shunda said, "The promotion of special crops was good in the past, but it did not take into account the different climates of each district. For example, the sixth and seventh districts have many mountains and are not suitable for planting 'Golden Queen' corn, but they were forced to plant it, causing losses to the masses." Someone said, "Hoeing the land three times is good; but in order to be quick, it is not good to hoe it three times immediately after hoeing it twice." Someone said, "Organizing autumn plowing is also right; but last year we talked about techniques all spring and summer, and during the autumn harvest, in order to plow the land early, we launched an autumn harvest blitz, cutting down green crops and wasting a lot of grain." Yang Yonggao said, "We were not working in combination with the experience of the masses, but subjectively prescribed a set of rules, arbitrarily creating new methods, trying to make the masses 'obey' us, but as a result, we became detached from the masses. When promoting special crops, we always wanted to exceed the plan, planting even land that could not be planted, resulting in less grain being harvested." Everyone discussed how to implement new technologies among the masses and unanimously agreed that the existing technical committees should be reorganized using democratic methods, absorbing experienced old farmers to participate, so that new technologies and old experiences could be combined, and new technologies could be promoted based on the experience of the masses. Leadership should meet the needs of the masses and proceed from the interests of the masses, opposing commandism and formalism. Technical guidance should be combined with the formulation of production plans. For example, when planning to hoe seedlings, we should also study how the crops are growing and how they should be hoed. This makes it easier to achieve the intentions of the leadership, and the technical committee will not become a mere formality. (Cooperation Section of Pingshun County Government)
　　【Taihang News】On the first day of the fifth lunar month, the third district of Gaoyi had a thorough rain. The next day, the cadres of each base point were convened for an emergency meeting to arrange for a blitz of sowing and hoeing. After discussion, everyone agreed that in order to do it quickly and well, it was necessary to organize and exchange labor. Some people felt tired of mutual aid and labor exchange. Everyone studied the reasons in depth: First, in the past, commandism was used, and households with no labor were forcibly assigned to groups, which disadvantaged households with labor and livestock. Second, the formalism of prescribing a set of meeting reporting systems was troublesome for the masses. Third, the method of setting and calculating points was too complicated and did not meet the needs of the masses. Some could not figure out the accounts, and some were afraid of suffering losses, so they dragged out the accounting time for a long time, giving the masses a headache. Fourth, cadres nominally participated in mutual assistance, often using the excuse of attending meetings to avoid working in the fields, making the masses work for nothing. Fifth, cadres simply wanted to win competitions and complete tasks, regardless of whether the masses were willing, and forced them to work. After reviewing the above reasons, it was immediately decided to overcome them in the future: 1. Call on the masses to combine voluntarily and thoroughly overcome the formalistic set of regulations. Determine that the main task of the leadership is to help the masses solve difficult problems. 2. Do not be restricted by formality; two or three households can form a group. Mobilize the masses to freely discuss tomorrow's work during breaks, without forcing them to make plans. 3. Exchange at equal value, according to the habits of the masses, and exchange livestock and labor on the principle of mutual benefit. Solve problems immediately when they arise; do not abandon leadership or allow it to drift freely. 4. Induce other groups to automatically learn from good groups, good methods, and good results. In short, on the one hand, we must resolutely overcome commandism and formalism; on the other hand, we must organize extensively, save labor and do more work, and prevent production from falling into laissez-faire. For this reason, we must repeatedly publicize the purpose and significance of mutual assistance, so that the masses can truly organize voluntarily. In addition, regarding the issue of village cadres, the meeting emphasized that they should be commended for their contributions to production, and mistakes should be offset by merits, in order to improve their relationship with the masses. District cadres should help village cadres study the district party committee's letter to peasants, party members, and village cadres to improve their thinking and understanding.

　　平顺劳动英雄开会检讨
  　领导生产要从实际出发
    【太行讯】平顺县府本月初召集七十多个劳动英雄、技术能手开会，检讨过去生产中组织领导与技术指导的各种问题，研究今后的办法。太行劳动英雄李顺达说：“过去推广特种作物很好，但没照顾各区不同气候。如六、七区山多，不宜种‘金皇后’玉茭，也非种不行，使群众受损失。”有人说：“地要锄三遍是好的；但为了图快，锄过二遍马上锄三遍就不好。”有人说：“组织秋垡地也对；可是去年讲了一春天一夏天技术，秋收时为了早垡地，来了个秋收突击，把青庄稼都割了，糟蹋了不少粮食。”杨永高说：“咱们不是和群众的经验结合起来干，而是主观的规定一套，随便创造新办法，想叫群众‘服气’咱，结果脱离了群众。推广特种作物时总想超过计划，把不能种的地也种上，结果少收了粮食。”大家讨论如何把新技术贯彻到群众中去，一致认为应以民主方法整顿现有的技术委员会，吸收有经验的老农参加，使新技术与旧经验结合，根据群众经验推广新技术。领导要适合群众要求，从群众利益出发，反对命令主义与形式主义。技术指导要与订生产计划结合起来。如计划锄苗时，就同时研究庄稼长得如何，该怎样锄。这样容易实现领导意图，技术委员会也不会流于形式。（平顺县府合作科）
    【太行讯】高邑三区在阴历五月初一落了透雨，第二天分头召集各基点干部紧急会议，布置突击下种与锄苗工作。经过大家讨论，一致认为要想搞的又快又好，必须组织起来，互助变工。有些群众对互助变工感觉厌倦。大家深入研究了的原因：一是过去强迫命令，硬把无劳力户编到组内，使有劳力，有牲口户吃亏。二是形式主义的规定一套会议上报制度，群众嫌麻烦。三是订分计分办法太复杂，不合群众要求。有的算不清帐，有的因怕吃亏，把算帐时间拖得很长，群众头痛。四是干部名义上参加互助，时常借口开会不去上地，叫群众白给做活。五是干部单纯为着竞赛胜利与完成任务，不管群众愿不愿意，硬催着群众干。检讨出上述原因后，当即决定今后克服的办法：一、号召群众自愿结合，彻底克服形式主义规定的一套制度。确定领导的主要任务是帮助群众解决困难问题。二、不拘形式，三户两户都可结组。发动群众利用干活的休息时间自由商量明天活计，不给人家硬订计划。三、等价交换，依照群众习惯而定，在双方有利的原则下交换畜力人工。有了问题马上帮助解决，不能放弃领导，任其自流互解。四、以好的组，好的办法，好的效果诱导别的组自动学习。总之，一方面要坚决克服强迫命令与形式主义的作法，一方面又要大量组织起来，省工多做活，不使生产陷于自流。为此必须反复宣传互助的目的与意义。使群众真正自愿的组织起来。此外，关于村干问题，会上强调在生产中立功，有错的以功抵过，借以改善自己与群众的关系。区干要帮助村干学习区党委告农民、党员、村干部书，提高其思想与认识。
