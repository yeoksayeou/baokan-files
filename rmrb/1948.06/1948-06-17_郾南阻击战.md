　　The Yannan Blocking Action

　　(1) Not Allowing the Enemy to Cross the Shahe River
　　At dawn on May 30th, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army rushed to the south bank of the Shahe and Fenghe Rivers opposite Yancheng to set up defenses, blocking the attack of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 18th Army coming from the direction of Xuchang in the north. That afternoon, under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy attempted to forcibly cross the Shahe River. The 9th company, guarding the ferry crossing opposite the south gate of Yancheng, repelled the enemy with fierce and sudden fire, sending them retreating in disarray. At a ferry crossing on the Fenghe River, two enemy soldiers in plainclothes were pulling a boat. PLA soldiers took aim and shot them down with two "pat, pat" shots. The enemy was blocked and unable to cross the river. Then, they concentrated mountain guns, heavy mortars, and 60mm mortars to bombard the south bank of the river day and night. On the PLA positions, various calibers of artillery also roared, shaking the earth. At midnight, the river water shone with thousands of red lights, and the enemy's artillery fire gradually subsided. The next day, the two sides faced each other across the river. The soldiers discussed among themselves. Soldier Dong Liansheng said, "If we don't let the enemy cross the river, they won't be able to cross."

　　(2) Deputy Platoon Leader Fang Kills Eight Enemies in a Row
　　On the morning of May 30th, Deputy Platoon Leader Fang Zhengyun dug a gun hole in a house on North Luohe Street, patiently waiting for the enemy. After a while, the enemy raised a small flag on their position, waving it randomly in the air. Fang Zhengyun took aim, but did not pull the trigger. After a moment, an enemy officer stood up holding the small flag. Fang Zhengyun fired a shot, and the enemy fell to the ground with a thud, kicking his legs wildly. Another enemy soldier tried to crawl over to pull him, but as soon as he reached out, Fang Zhengyun's bullet arrived, ending his life. The third enemy was also shot down in the same way. Fang Zhengyun's fourth shot was aimed at another enemy bunker. By the time Fang Zhengyun had shot down the seventh enemy, the enemy discovered the firing hole and concentrated their fire to block it. But as soon as the enemy poked their head out from the bunker, Fang Zhengyun's gun fired again from another firing hole, and the eighth enemy fell on the north bank of the Shahe River.

　　(3) Driving the Enemy into the Honghe River
　　On the afternoon of June 3rd, the third squad of a certain unit of the PLA, defending the south bank of the Honghe River, had their seventy-meter-wide position broken through by two enemy companies. Second Platoon Leader Shi Likui was ordered to lead the second platoon to resolutely recapture the position. Platoon Leader Shi shouted, "Heroes of the Second Platoon, follow me!" and immediately led a squad out of the fortifications to charge. But the road ahead was blocked by the enemy's dense artillery fire. At this moment, Political Instructor Lian Yu stepped forward with a pistol and a grenade... They charged together, and volley guns and grenades blossomed in the enemy ranks. More than two hundred enemies were thrown into chaos, scrambling and crawling backwards. More than thirty enemy corpses were abandoned next to the fortifications, and a dozen enemies were buried at the bottom of the river. The position was returned to the hands of the People's Liberation Army.

　　(4) Sooner or Later We'll Be Prisoners Anyway
　　On the night of the second day of the blocking action, a Chiang Kai-shek 18th Army soldier named Xu Jizhen secretly crossed the Shahe River and ran to the PLA sentry post. His first words were: "Great, I've finally come home." According to him, his hometown was near Luohe. His elderly parents depended on him to farm and do small business. Not many days ago, he was working in the fields when he was suddenly surrounded by several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. After being captured, he was immediately put in a military uniform and assigned to the 6th squad of the 4th company of the 353rd regiment of the 18th Brigade. He said: Every squad in the whole company only had two or three old soldiers. Just after I was assigned to the squad, three ran away. When we were transferred to another place, conscripts were grabbed to replenish the ranks. In one month, my squad grabbed five conscripts, but three ran away. In battle, new recruits were afraid as soon as they heard gunfire. This time, as soon as the fighting started, two more ran away. I was the third to escape. The squad leader of the 8th squad, a soldier of five or six years, recently deserted with three new recruits. These days, everyone secretly says, "Chasing the Eighth Route Army and fighting the Eighth Route Army, sooner or later we'll be prisoners anyway."

　　郾南阻击战
　　（一）不叫敌人过沙河
    五月三十日黎明，解放军某团赶到郾城对面沙河和沣河的南岸设防，阻击北面由许昌方面来的蒋匪十八军的进攻。当天下午，敌人在炮火掩护下企图强渡沙河，守卫城郾南关对岸渡口的第九连以猛烈而突然的火力把敌人打得狼狈后退，沣河的一个渡口上两个敌人的便衣正在拉船，解放军战士瞄准他“拍拍”地两枪就被打倒了，敌军被阻过不得河，于是集中了山炮、重迫击炮、六零炮向河的南岸昼夜轰击，解放军阵地上，各种口径的大炮也震撼天地地轰鸣起来，深夜的河水里闪耀着千万道红光，敌人的炮火渐渐暗哑了。第二天双方隔河对峙着，战士们纷纷议论起来，战士冬连生说：“不叫敌人过河他就不能过。”
　　（二）方副排长连杀八敌
    五月卅日上午，副排长方正云在漯河北街的一所房子里挖了个枪眼，耐心的安候着敌人。不一会，敌人的阵地上竖起了一面小旗子，在空中乱摇，方正云端正一个瞄准姿式，但却没有扣板机。一会一个敌人军官举着小旗站起来，方正云“拍”的一枪，只见敌人应声倒地，两腿乱踢。另一个敌人想爬过去拉他，刚一伸手，方正云的子弹就赶到了，结束了他的生命。第三个敌人也是同样的被打倒在地，方正云第四枪是瞄准了另一处敌人的掩体，到了方正云打倒第七个敌人时，敌人发觉射击孔，就集中火力把它封锁了，但敌人从掩体里刚一露头，在另外的一个枪眼里，方正云的枪又响了，于是第八个敌人又倒在沙河的北岸上。
　　（三）把敌人赶进洪河里去
    六月三日下午，防御在洪河南岸的解放军某部三班，他们所防守的七十米宽的阵地，被敌人两个连突破了，二排排长石立魁奉命带二排坚决夺回阵地，石排长喊了一声“二排的英雄跟我来”，立即带着一个班跳出工事来冲锋，但前进的道路被敌人密集的炮火封锁住了，这时政治指导员联玉举着盒子枪提着炸弹挺身而出，………。他们一齐冲上去，排子枪手榴弹在敌人群中开了花，二百多个敌人乱做一团，连滚带爬地向后溃窜，工事旁边遗弃了三十多个敌尸，十几个敌人葬身河底，阵地重回到解放军手中。
　　（四）早晚也要当俘虏
    当阻击战打响的第二天夜里，一个名叫许继祯的蒋军十八军士兵偷偷地渡过沙河跑到解放军哨兵阵地上来，他的第一句话是：“可好了我可算到了家了。”据称，他的家乡就在漯河附近，年迈的双亲靠他一人种地兼作小生意过活，不多几天以前，他正在地里作活，忽然被几个蒋军围上来，捉住后马上给他穿上军服，当天就被补到十八旅三五三团四连六班当兵。他说：全连每个班都只有两三个老兵，我刚补进班里接连就跑了三个，开到另一个地方，就抓壮丁来补充，在一个月内我这个班就抓了五个壮丁，可是跑了三个，作战时新兵一听见枪声就害怕，这次一打响又跑了两个，我是第三个逃跑的。老兵看见新兵乱跑，虽然口里骂着“孬种”！但他们也一样干得不起劲或是开小差。八班长是个五六年的老兵，最近就带着三个新兵开了小差。这些天大家偷偷说：“追八路打八路早晚也要当俘虏”。
