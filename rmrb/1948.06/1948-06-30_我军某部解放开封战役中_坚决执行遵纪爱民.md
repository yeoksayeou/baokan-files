　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 28th: A certain unit of our army, after undergoing new-style training, has universally enhanced its concept of "obeying discipline and loving the people." In the recent Kaifeng campaign, their practical actions moved the masses in the outskirts of Kaifeng, who enthusiastically rose up to support the People's Liberation Army in combat. Before the campaign began, the Party branch of this unit provided specialized education to the personnel sent to the new district, and called on Communist Party members to guarantee this through their exemplary actions. When the troops entered a village more than ten miles from Kaifeng, most of the villagers left due to being deceived by Chiang bandit rumors. The leadership called on the soldiers to look after the houses for the landlords, preserve their belongings, and feed the livestock well. The landlord of the family where the Seventh Squad was stationed had left, but the old yellow cow and pig were still at home. Soldier Xiao Huang fed the pig well and led the cow to the meadow outside the village to graze. The landlord of the house where the Quartermaster Department was stationed had sugar, cigarettes, matches, and fried dough sticks on the table. The soldiers stayed there for three days without touching any of it. Comrades who smoked looked for fire under the pot but didn't take a single match from the landlord. When they arrived at another village, most of the masses had also left. Quartermaster Wang Mingxuan went to the fields outside the village to find the villagers to carry out propaganda, exposing the rumors of the Chiang bandits and explaining the policies of the People's Liberation Army. Later, some of the masses slowly returned. His landlord's mother was initially very afraid, but as soon as she entered the door, Wang Mingxuan poured her boiled water to drink. She also saw that her cow had been fed by the soldiers until its belly was round and lying there, making the old lady very happy. In this way, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, and all the villagers quickly returned. A landlord named Zhu Zhen in the village ran to Kaifeng. After the accountant in charge of borrowing grain, Zhang Fengxi, investigated, he borrowed 10% of his income in grain, wrote a letter explaining that the borrowed grain was to offset the public grain, stuck it on the granary, and advised him to go home and live a good life in peace. After the People's Liberation Army entered the South Gate of Kaifeng, Zhu Zhen ran home and was extremely happy to see the letter stuck on the granary. He said, "If I had known the People's Liberation Army was so good, why would I have gone to Kaifeng to be frightened?" He immediately told others about this, and as a result, the twelve landlords and rich peasants who had fled also returned, cleaned the grain mixed with wheat bran, and harnessed four large carts to help deliver supplies. Middle peasant Zhu Kewen said, "The People's Liberation Army loves the people so much. Where can you find such a good army in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad?" The masses reflected one after another, saying, "If we had known the People's Liberation Army was like this, who wouldn't be willing to contribute labor for stretchers?" They immediately busied themselves grinding flour, steaming buns, and tying stretchers to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Kaifeng.

　　我军某部解放开封战役中
  　坚决执行遵纪爱民
    【新华社开封前线廿八日电】解放军某部经过新式整训后，“遵纪爱民”观念普遍提高，此次在开封战役中以实际的行动感动了开封近郊的群众，自动踊跃的起而支援解放军作战。战役开始前，该部党的支部即对派到新区的工作人员进行专门的教育，并号召共产党员要以自己的模范作用作保证，当部队进入开封十余里的某一村庄时，该村群众因受蒋匪谣言欺骗，大部离开。领导上就号召战士们为房东看好门，保存好东西，喂好牲畜。七班住的那家房东走了，老黄牛和猪还在家里，战士小黄就喂好猪，又把牛牵到村外草地上去放青。事务处住的房东的桌子上放着白糖、香烟、洋火和油条，战士们在那儿住了三天一点也没有动，抽烟的同志到锅底下找火也没拿房东一根火柴。到另一村庄的时候，大部群众也都走了，粮秣员王明轩就到村外地里找老乡宣传，向他们揭发蒋匪的谣言，说明解放军的政策。后来群众就慢慢的回来了一些，他的房东大娘起先还很害怕，但刚一进门，王明轩就端开水给她喝，又看到她的牛已被战士们喂的圆圆的肚子卧在那里，大娘可乐了。这样一传十，十传百，全村群众很快的就都回来了。村上有一个叫朱振的地主跑到开封，负责借粮的会计张风锡调查好后，就借了他收入的百分之十的粮食，写了一封说明借粮顶公粮的信插在囤上，并劝他回家好好安心过日子。解放军攻入开封南关后，朱振跑回家看了囤上插的信高兴的不得了，他说：“早知道解放军这样好，上开封受惊干啥？”马上把这一件事情告诉别人，结果跑出去的十二家地主富农也都回来了，还把掺了麦糠的粮食弄干净，套好四辆大车帮送给养。中农朱克温说：“解放军这样爱民，古今中外哪里去找这样的好队伍。”群众纷纷反映说：“早知解放军这样，出夫担架谁不情愿。”都马上紧张的磨面，蒸馍，绑担架，支援解放军解放开封。
