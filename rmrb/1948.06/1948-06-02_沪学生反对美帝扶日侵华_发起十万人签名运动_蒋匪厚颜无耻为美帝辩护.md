Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to a report from the Shanghai Foreign Correspondence, Shanghai students have launched a ten thousand-signature campaign to oppose US imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression threatening China. This movement was initiated by the "Shanghai Students' United Association Against US Aid to Japan Policy and to Save the National Crisis" (Associated Press) and announced at the Shanghai student celebration of the first anniversary of the All-China Student Federation on May 22nd. In leaflets distributed by the association, it called for effective measures to prevent the United States from assisting Japanese reactionaries in invading China, and denounced the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek for retaining Okamura Neiji, the chief culprit of the Japanese invasion of China and former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, as an advisor, continuing the crime of slaughtering the Chinese people. Several schools in Shanghai recently held meetings to plan and promote this righteous movement. St. John's University, sponsored by the American Church, recently held a poll on the theme of the United States' policy toward Japan. Among the 940 students, 860 believed that the revival of Japanese fascism would cause Japan to invade China again; 930 pointed out that "American reactionaries are the main supporters of the revival of Japanese aggression"; and 726 condemned "the United States for supporting the revival of Japanese aggression in an attempt to seize the Far East market and military bases for its own selfish interests." The school recently held an exhibition, using woodcut charts and cartoons to show the threat of US imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese aggression to the people of the East. According to an Associated Press report, a mimeographed student newspaper issued by the Shanghai Student Union denounced the Chiang Kai-shek gang for "selling out national interests in order to carry out civil war and slaughter the people, allowing US troops to be stationed in China to plunder, rape, and kill, and being willing to cooperate with US and Japanese imperialism in a vain attempt to prevent the welfare of the Chinese people." The Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek gang, terrified by the vigorous student patriotic movement, shamelessly ordered all newspapers to be banned from publishing commentaries criticizing the US policy toward Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th: Another tragic incident of US troops shooting and killing our compatriots occurred in Qingdao. On the evening of May 5th, several citizens were walking along Daxue Road in the city when they were suddenly shot by US troops. Four people were hit, two of whom died on the spot, and another of the two injured died in the hospital due to serious injuries. After the tragedy, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities hurriedly published a message from the US Marine Corps News Office in the Qingdao Chiang Party's newspaper "Minyan Daily" on May 7th, distorting the facts and insulting the Chinese people, falsely accusing the victims of "attempting to move US military supplies" to excuse their American masters. The people of Qingdao are extremely indignant about this.

　　沪学生反对美帝扶日侵华
    发起十万人签名运动
  　蒋匪厚颜无耻为美帝辩护
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据上海外国通讯社报导：上海学生已发起一个十万人的签名运动，反对美帝国主义扶植日本侵略势力复活威胁中国。此一运动系由“上海学生反对美国援日政策，挽救民族危机联合会”所发起（合众社），而于五月二十二日沪学生庆祝全国学联成立一周年大会上宣布。该会在所散发出传单中，号召应该采取有效措施，防止美国扶助日本反动派侵略中国，并痛斥人民公敌蒋介石留用日本侵华罪魁，前日本驻华派遣军总司令冈村宁次为顾问，继续进行屠杀中国人民的罪恶。上海若干学校，日前纷纷集会，策划推进此一正义运动。由美国教会主办的圣约翰大学，最近举行以美国对日政策为主题的民意测验，在九百四十名学生中，有八百六十人认为日本法西斯复活，将引起日本再度侵华；九百三十人指出：“美国反动派是日本侵略主义复活的主要支持者”；七百二十六人谴责“美国为企图夺取远东市场与军事基地的一己私利，而扶持日本侵略势力复活。”该校日前并举行展览会，用木刻图表、漫画表明美帝扶植日本侵略势力复活对东方各民族的威胁。据合众社报导：上海学生联合会所发行的油印学生报中，痛斥蒋家匪帮“为了进行内战，屠杀人民，不惜出卖民族利益，容许美军驻在中国抢掠强奸和杀人，并宁愿与美日帝国主义合作，妄图阻止中国人民的福利。”上海蒋家匪帮震慑于蓬勃的学生爱国运动，竟厚颜无耻的下令禁止各报发表抨击美国对日政策的评论。
    【新华社华东二十七日电】青岛又发生美军枪杀我同胞惨案。五月五日晚，市民数人行经该市大学路，突遭美军射击，中弹者四人，当场惨死二人，另二伤者送至医院时，一人因伤重毙命。惨案发生后，蒋匪当局慌忙于五月七日在青市蒋党机关报“民言报”上发表美海军陆战队新闻处消息，歪曲事实真相，侮辱中国人民，诬指被害同胞“企图搬移美军物资”，为其美国主子开脱罪行。青岛市民对此异常愤慨。
