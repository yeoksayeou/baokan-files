Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Reports from various sources: All workers affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) went on a one-hour general strike on the 19th to protest the bloody incident manufactured by the reactionaries in Clermont-Ferrand. On the 19th, when the designated strike time (11:00 AM to 12:00 PM) arrived, all workers across the country under the leadership of the CGT strictly obeyed the order, left their workplaces, and carried out a one-hour protest general strike. The general strike in Paris was held earlier on the 18th, because the originally scheduled strike time on the 19th coincided with their day off. On the evening of the 18th, when the strike signal whistle sounded, tens of thousands of Parisian workers poured into the streets and marched in demonstration. A total of 500,000 workers from various industries such as metal, aviation, and automobile participated in the Paris strike. Simultaneously with the general strike demonstration, the CGT announced on the 19th that it would again demand a 20 percent wage increase within the next week.

  　法全国总罢工一小时
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：法国总工会所属的全部工人，于十九日总罢工一小时，以抗议反动派在克勒蒙腓隆制造的血案。十九日，当规定的罢工时间（上午十一时至十二时）一到，全国各地在总工会领导下的一切工人，都严格遵守命令，离开工作地点，实行一小时的抗议总罢工。巴黎城的总罢工，则提前于十八日举行，因原定十九日的罢工时间正逢他们休假。十八日傍晚，当罢工的信号汽笛一响，成千成万的巴黎工人就涌到街头，列队示威。参加巴黎罢工的金属、飞机、汽车等各业工人共达五十万。与总罢工的示威同时，总工会于十九日宣布将在下星期内再次要求增资百分之二十。
