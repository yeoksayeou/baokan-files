Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: According to various sources: all students of Yanjing University, more than 750 students of Peking University, and more than 80 faculty members of Tsinghua University successively announced on the 20th and 21st of this month their refusal to accept the hypocritical so-called "relief grain" from the American "China Relief Mission," to express their protest against American support for Japan's aggression against China, and especially against the insulting remarks made by US Ambassador Stuart and US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, against the Chinese people. Yanjing students said that their action was to oppose the United States "trying to shut our mouths with relief food" (Associated Press). Peking University students posted their ration cards on the wall, indicating they would rather starve to death than accept American "relief supplies." Among the 80 faculty members of Tsinghua University who refused American "relief," was Robert Winter, an American foreign language professor aged 61. When interviewed by the Associated Press on the 21st, he condemned Cabot's statement as "stupid and ignorant."

In addition, students of Peiyang University in Tianjin had returned the eggs purchased with American relief funds and the remaining funds to the American "China Relief Mission" in mid-June and decided to send a telegram to Stuart to protest his absurd statement on June 4.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Brief News on Student Movements in the Chiang Area:

△ Students of Nankai University in Tianjin went on strike for two days starting on June 10 to protest American support for Japan and Stuart's absurd statement on June 4.

　　燕京北大清华师生
  　拒受美国“救济”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据各方消息：北平燕京全体学生、北大七百五十余学生及清华八十余教职员，先后于本月二十及二十一日宣布拒绝接受美国“中华救济团”假仁假义的所谓“救济粮食”，以表示他们对于美国扶日侵华的抗议，特别是对于美大使司徒雷登和美驻沪总领事卡波特侮辱中国人民言论的抗议。燕大学生说，他们所以采取这一行动，是反对美国“试图以救济食粮堵住我们的嘴”（美联社）。北大学生将配给证贴在墙上，表示宁愿饿死也不要美国的“救济物资”。清华拒受美国“救济”的八十名教职员中，包括六十一岁高龄的美籍外文教授罗伯特·温脱。他在二十一日接见美联社记者时谴责卡波特的声明为“愚蠢而且无知”。
    此外，天津北洋大学学生已于本月中旬将美国救济款项所购买的鸡蛋及剩余款项退回美国“中华救济团”，并决定致电司徒雷登抗议其六月四日的荒谬声明。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋区学运简讯：
    △天津南开大学学生，为抗议美国扶日及司徒雷登六月四日的荒谬声明，于六月十日起罢课两天。唐山交大工学院亦为此罢课，并于十一日分组赴唐山街头进行爱国宣传。
    △天津北洋大学学生自治会五月卅一日议决：为北平中法大学学生马锡天被捕，决定联络南开、河北工学院发表抗议宣言；并与华北各院校联络，致电武汉大学学生，表示纪念“六·一血案周年”。按：去年六月一日武大学生黄鸣岗、陈如丰、王志德横遭军警用美制达姆弹杀害殉难，戴＠等五人重伤，学生被捕者载满三卡车，教授金克木等五人亦同时被捕。
    △据六月二日天津大公报沪讯：上月三十一日，上海法学院时事漫画展览会被捣毁、学生被殴捕事件中，三青团曾出动三大卡车人员前往行凶。
