　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS reports: Broad sections of the American people continue to wage a struggle against the Mundt Bill. Forty-eight branches of the "New York Youth for Wallace Committee" held a day-long mass meeting in New York, where thousands of people signed petitions against the Mundt Bill. The "National Youth Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill," composed of representatives from organizations such as the "Christian Student Movement," the "National Jewish Youth Assembly," "American Youth for Democracy," and the "Youth for Wallace Committee," has now been declared established. At the anti-Mundt Bill banquet held by the "Committee of 1000" on the 4th, Utah Democratic Senator Thomas condemned the bill as "endangering the freedom of the American people." He said, "If Jefferson (referring to the founder of the Democratic Party and the fourth President of the United States) were alive today, he would be condemned as a Communist under the provisions of the Mundt Bill." The "Committee of 1000" also published a joint letter of protest to the press from twenty-five prominent educators, including Union Theological Seminary professor Bowie, Harvard University astronomer Shapley, and New York University Medical School professor Jencks, among others. At a forum of over a thousand people hosted by the progressive publications "New Masses" and "Mainstream," many famous writers and artists delivered speeches denouncing the bill. Novelist Fast said: "The names of the makers of this bill should be listed among the most contemptible people." The Worker's Daily reported that Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson, Pennsylvania Democratic Senator Meyer, Florida Democratic Senator Pepper, New Mexico Democratic Senator Chavez, and Connecticut Republican Senator Baldwin have declared their opposition to the Mundt Bill.
