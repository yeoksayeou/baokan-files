Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st – During the second phase of military training in the second-line corps of the Northeast's Hejiang Military Region, it was discovered that some new soldiers had thoughts of returning home after enlisting, as well as issues regarding unity among soldiers from middle peasant, poor peasant, and hired laborer backgrounds. After active education, these problems were effectively resolved.

Some new soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds, because their families had just been allocated land and some movable property after the land reform, often thought about returning home to start a business, which affected their morale during military training. In addition, problems with the educational and management methods of individual military cadres further strengthened their desire to go home. After the leadership discovered this phenomenon, they concentrated their efforts on solving it. On the one hand, they sent capable cadres deep into the squads and platoons to live with the new soldiers like brothers, and the educational and management methods were greatly improved, so that their lives and emotions were taken care of and concerned. On the other hand, they carried out education using specific examples, pointing out that the purpose of land reform was to allow farmers to settle down and become prosperous, but defeating the landlord class locally only eliminated the "little Chiang Kai-sheks" in the villages. If the turned-over peasants did not take up arms themselves and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's army, the immediate benefits would still be insecure, and wealth could not belong to them for long. Farmers easily understood this principle. After the education methods were improved, there was warmth in the army, and the principles were explained clearly, they quickly eliminated the phenomenon of uneasiness and feigning illness, and actively participated in the military training movement.

Another group of new soldiers, influenced by the "leftist" errors on the middle peasant issue during the land reform, still often had discord among soldiers from middle peasant, poor peasant, and hired laborer backgrounds after enlisting. A small number of new soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds one-sidedly emphasized the wavering nature of the middle peasants, resulting in a sense of contempt. The new soldiers from middle peasant backgrounds developed negative thoughts such as "not being able to get along in the countryside, and not being able to get along in the army either," which affected their enthusiasm for military training. After understanding the situation, a certain regiment of the corps first held separate meetings. At the symposium for new soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds, it was emphasized that the middle peasants are permanent allies of the revolution, and that infringing on the interests of the middle peasants in the land reform and despising soldiers from middle peasant backgrounds in the army would only confuse their own revolutionary ranks. It is necessary to consolidate and unite with the middle peasants so that the revolution can succeed and the distributed land can be protected. At the symposium for new soldiers from middle peasant backgrounds, attention was paid to dispelling all concerns, patiently guiding them to express their doubts, and then conducting discussions to make them understand the Communist Party's policy of uniting with the middle peasants. At the same time, it was made clear that the middle peasants must make revolution together with the poor peasants and hired laborers in order to have a bright future. After these separate symposiums, a unity conference was held, and earnest criticism and self-criticism were carried out. Everyone expressed their determination to unite and defeat the common enemy, Chiang Kai-shek. Some new soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds even jointly wrote letters to their village governments and farmers' associations, requesting that they seriously compensate for the losses of the middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against, and also wrote letters to the families of the wrongly struggled middle peasants to apologize. Soldiers from middle peasant backgrounds also wrote letters home, advising their families to focus on production, overcome difficulties, and not rely solely on compensation, and telling their families that soldiers from poor peasant, hired laborer, and middle peasant backgrounds all respected and loved each other in the army, like one family. This experience of the regiment has been adopted by other units.

　　东北合江军区二期练兵中
  　加强中贫农出身战士团结
    【新华社东北二十一日电】东北合江军区第二线兵团在第二期练兵运动中发现部分新战士入伍后存在着回家思想及中贫雇之间的团结问题，经过积极教育，获得良好解决。一部分贫雇农出身的新战士，因土改后家里刚刚分得了土地与部分浮财，常常想到回家立业，影响到在练兵中的情绪，加以个别军事干部教育与管理方式有毛病，便更加增强了他们想家的念头。领导上发现此种现象以后，就集中力量进行解决，一面派有力干部深入班排，与新战士共同生活，象亲兄弟一样，教育管理方式亦大大改善，使他们的生活与情绪得到照顾与关切；另一方面便针对上述思想，用具体实例进行教育，说明土改目的本是为了农民安家立业发财致富，但打倒了本地的地主阶级只是消灭了乡村中的小蒋介石，若是翻身农民不自己手拿武器，把蒋介石的军队全部消灭，眼前的利益还是保不稳，财富还是不能长久属于自己。农民很容易懂得这个道理。教育方式改善以后，在部队里有了温暖，又把道理说明白，他们就迅速消除了不安心与装病的现象，积极地参加练兵运动。另一部新战士，因受土改中在中农问题上左倾错误的影响，入伍后，中贫雇农之间仍常发生不和现象。少数贫雇农出身的新战士，片面地强调中农的动摇性，以致形成轻视心理。中农出身的新战士即产生“在地方上吃不开，到队伍里也吃不开”的消极想法，因而影响了他们练武的热情。该兵团某团在了解情况以后，首先分别召开会议，在贫雇出身的新战士座谈会上，着重指出中农是革命的永久同盟军，在土改中侵犯中农利益，在部队中轻视中农出身的战士，都是混乱自己革命阵线，一定要巩固地团结中农，革命才能成功，才能保得住分得的土地。在中农出身的新战士座谈会上，则注意打破一切顾虑，耐心引导他们把心里的怀疑都说出来，然后进行讨论，使他们了解共产党团结中农的政策，同时说明白中农必须和贫雇农一道革命，才有光明前途。这样分别座谈以后，便合并举行团结大会，彼此进行了恳切的批评与自我批评，大家都表示决心团结一致打倒共同敌人蒋介石。有些贫雇农出身的新战士更自动联名写信给自己村里政府农会要求认真补偿被错斗的中农损失，还写信给被错斗的中农家属道歉。中农出身的战士也写信回家劝家里好好生产，克服困难，不要单依靠补偿，并告诉家里中贫雇农出身的在部队里都互敬互爱，象一家人。该团的这个经验，已为其他各部所采用。
