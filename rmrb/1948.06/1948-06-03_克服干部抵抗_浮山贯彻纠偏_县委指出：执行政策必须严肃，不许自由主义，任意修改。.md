　　【Taiyue News】Leftist recklessness in Fushan is very serious. For example, in Chengguan, out of 330 households, 110 were struggled against. Of those, 60 were known to be middle peasants, 40 poor peasants, and 1 vagrant. In the 40 administrative villages of the old districts of Two, Four, and Five, only eight villages did not infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants. However, at this county-wide district cadre meeting, most cadres still considered this serious leftist error to be a "poor peasant viewpoint." Even after conveying the decision of the Prefectural Committee's joint county secretary meeting to correct leftist recklessness, some still said it was like "a toad jumping the threshold, hurting both its butt and its face." Some even mistakenly believed that correcting deviations was the ideology of landlords and rich peasants, saying that the higher-ups were worrying about landlords and rich peasants. After discussion, they accepted the general principles, but emphasized difficulties and resistance on specific issues. For example, they said that principles are easy to understand, but specifics are not. They challenged the superiors to try it themselves, saying it would be difficult for them! To compensate the middle peasants, while also taking care of the hired and poor, and resettling the landlords and rich peasants, where would the things come from? How would the hired and poor turn over a new leaf? They worked hard all winter, and what did they get? Taking things back from the hired and poor, and then trying to mobilize them again, it would take generations to mobilize them...and so on. Later, when examining the actual harm caused in each village, everyone's emotions began to change, and their understanding improved. Everyone said, "Putting yourself in their shoes is the same; if you want fairness, turn it upside down." Sun Chunjing, a cadre from the Third District, said, "When my village was struggling last winter, my family was middle peasant, and we were afraid of being struggled against too." But at this time, there was also a fear of losing face. Su Yangui said, "Now the district cadres need to be transferred; if they are not transferred, there is no way to explain it to people, and we can't stand being scolded by the hired and poor." After further in-depth discussion of these issues, everyone realized the harm to the work from their personal experiences. For example, they cited the example of Xipo in the Third District, saying, "In Xipo natural village, out of 45 households, 23 were struggled against. Li Hualan, the head of the hired and poor group, took a look at the widespread struggle in the village and felt panicked, daring to sleep only with a gun at night." After reaching a consensus, the specific steps for rectification were decided. In the old and semi-old districts (Fushan has new districts), meetings were convened to widely publicize policies (especially the middle peasant policy) and talk about class. Secondly, the infringed middle peasants must be immediately and resolutely compensated, with apologies and removal of the "struggle target" label, restoring all democratic rights. The County Party Committee also pointed out to the cadres the following points that must be paid attention to in future leadership: (1) Continue to eliminate the one-sided hired and poor viewpoint, proceeding from the greatest interests of the greatest number and from long-term interests. (2) Publicly admit mistakes to the masses; the idea of being afraid of losing face is wrong. (3) Acknowledge the difficulties in correcting deviations, but do not be afraid of difficulties; overcome difficulties. Persuade the masses patiently. (4) In the future, the attitude towards implementing policies must be serious; liberalism is not allowed, and arbitrary modification of the Party's policies is not allowed.

　　克服干部抵抗　浮山贯彻纠偏
    县委指出：执行政策必须严肃，不许自由主义，任意修改。
    【太岳消息】浮山左倾蛮干很严重。如城关三百卅户，就斗争了一百一十户，已知道的其中有中农六十户，贫农四十户，游民一户。在老区二、四、五区的四十个行政村中，只有八个村没有侵犯中农利益。但在这次全县区干部会上，大部干部对这种严重的左倾错误，还认为这就是“贫雇观点”。就是在传达了地委召开的县书联席会的纠正左倾蛮干决议后，还是有人说这是“蛤蟆跳门限又咚沟子（屁股）又伤脸”。更有人错误的认为纠偏是地主富农思想，说上面给地富操心哩。经讨论，在大道理上接受了，但在具体问题上便强调困难抵抗。如说什么原则好通具体不好通，叫上级来试试，叫我们为难啦！要赔偿中农，还要照顾雇贫，又要安置地富，东西从哪里来哩？雇贫还怎样翻身哩？白干了一冬，干了个哈？从雇贫手里要出来，再要发动，几辈子也发动不起来了……等。后来从各村实际危害的情形检查时，大家的情绪才有了转变，认识也提高了一步，大家说：“将心比心是一样的，若要公道打个颠倒。”三区干部孙春景说：“去年冬天我村斗争的时候，我家是中农，也怕斗争。”但这时又有一种怕丢人思想，苏延贵说：“现在区干部要调调，不调没法给人家说，挨雇贫的骂也挨不下”。把这些问题又经过深入讨论，大家从亲身体验中，认识了对工作的危害，如他们举出三区西坡的例子说：“西坡自然村，四十五户，斗争了廿三户，雇贫团长利花兰，在坡上看了一下村里斗争了一大片，心里着慌，黑夜抱着枪才敢睡觉。”认识一致后决定了纠偏的具体步骤，在老区半老区（浮山有新区）召集会议普遍的宣传政策（特别是中农政策）讲阶级。其次是对侵犯了的中农必需立即坚决的补偿，并赔情道歉摘掉“斗争对象”的帽子，恢复一切民主权利。县委又给干部指出：今后领导上必须注意的几点：（一）继续肃清片面的雇贫观点，一切从最大多数最大利益出发，从长远利益出发。（二）公开向群众承认错误，怕丢人的思想是错误的。（三）承认在纠偏中的困难，但不要怕困难，要克服困难。要耐心说服群众。（四）今后对执行政策必须是严肃态度，不允许犯自由主义，任意修改党的政策。
