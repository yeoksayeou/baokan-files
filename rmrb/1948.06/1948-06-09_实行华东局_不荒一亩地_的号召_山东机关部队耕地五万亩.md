Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th. The spring plowing movement carried out by the directly subordinate agencies and troops of East China and the Party, government, and military agencies and troops at all levels in Shandong, under the call of the East China Central Bureau of the CCP to "not waste an acre of land," has now come to an end. From March to early May, according to incomplete statistics: a total of more than 56,000 mu of land was cultivated, more than 36,000 cartloads of manure were delivered, more than 28,000 dan (a unit of dry measure) were delivered, more than 24,000 baskets of manure were carried, and more than 19,000 cartloads and 42,000 dan of manure were produced. During the movement, all agencies and troops organized all available manpower and animal power to participate in spring plowing. The cadre training team of the Military Region Health Department, the Beihai Bank Printing Plant, and other units used manpower to pull plows to make up for the lack of cattle power. The Lunan Binbei troops went to the disaster areas on the edge to carry out cultivation and assistance in cultivation. Some agencies in Lunan moved to villages with more wasteland to help with urgent planting. The Second Administrative Office of Luzhong organized a distant cultivation team to go to the disaster areas to help with cultivation. Frontline troops and laborers also used the gaps between the two battles to help the masses in the new areas with production.

　　实行华东局“不荒一亩地”的号召
  　山东机关部队耕地五万亩
    【新华社华东六日电】华东各直属机关部队及山东各级党政军机关部队，在中共华东中央局“不荒一亩地”的号召下所进行的春耕运动，现已告一段落。从三月到五月上旬，据不完全统计：共耕地刨地五万六千余亩，送粪三万六千余车，又二万八千余担，抬粪二万四千余筐，出粪一万九千余车，又四万二千余担。运动中各机关部队都组织了所有能抽出的人力、畜力投入春耕。军区卫生部干训队、北海银行印刷厂等单位，曾以人拉犁弥补牛力的不足，鲁南滨北部队纷纷开赴边沿区灾区进行代耕助耕、鲁南某些机关移住荒地较多的村庄帮助抢种，鲁中二专署则组织远耕队，开赴灾区助耕，前线部队及民工也利用两次战役中空隙时间，帮助新区群众生产。
