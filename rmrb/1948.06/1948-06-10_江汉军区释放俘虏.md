Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 7th. The Jianghan Military Region recently released over ten officers of the rank of colonel, including Li Chenxi, acting commander of the former Kuomintang army's New 15th Brigade, Zhang Bi, commander of the First Regiment, Liu Kechu, director of the press office, and You Zhizhong, battalion commander of the transport battalion, as well as over a hundred officers below the rank of lieutenant, who were captured alive by our forces in the Songhe campaign in Jingmen. Before their departure, the People's Liberation Army provided them with sufficient travel expenses and returned all the money and belongings that had been temporarily handed over when they laid down their weapons, after carefully counting them. When they heard the news of their release, they were all overjoyed and deeply moved. Yuan Moshen, an employee of the press office, said, "Rumors outside said that you would not be lenient to people from the press office when you caught them. I have always kept this suspicion to myself. Now the facts prove that those rumors are completely unfounded." Li Chenxi, Zhang Bi, and others were very happy to take pictures with the staff of the reception center, and Li requested that several more copies be developed for everyone to keep as a souvenir.

　　江汉军区释放俘虏
    【新华社中原前线七日电】江汉军区最近释放在京山宋河战役被我生俘的前国民党军新十五旅代旅长李辰熙，第一团团长张壁，新闻室主任刘克楚，辎重营营长游执中等十余名校级军官，及尉级以下军官共百余人。临行前，解放军发给他们足够的路费，并将放下武器时暂时交出的各人的钱物等，按数点查发还。当他们听到释放的消息时，莫不喜出望外，深为感动。新闻室干事元漠森说：“外边谣传你们捉住新闻室人员是不会宽大的，这种怀疑，我一直没有说出口来。现在事实证明，那些谣言毫无根据。”李辰熙、张壁等很高兴的和招待所的工作人员一起照像，李并要求多洗几张，给每个人留作纪念。
