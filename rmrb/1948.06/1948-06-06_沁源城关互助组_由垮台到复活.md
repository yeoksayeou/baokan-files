【Qinyuan News】The Chengguan Mutual Aid Groups in this county were doing very well in the spring and summer of last year. Last August 14th, Chengguan started an "anti-feudal movement," and in the struggle, 58 middle-peasant households were wrongly classified and controlled, causing panic among the middle peasants. Some said, "Oh! It will be our turn to be dealt with in a few days!" Most of the middle peasants stopped working. The hired laborers all joined the "Hired Laborer Corps" and separated from the middle peasants. Everyone was disunited, and no labor was carried out. A small number of hired laborers wanted to solve problems based on the harvest, and they did not pay attention to labor. The entire mutual aid group collapsed. No winter production was carried out, no transportation was done, and even manure was not accumulated, causing great difficulties for this year's spring plowing and a more severe spring famine. After the Administrative Office's announcement was issued, everyone understood that the old liberated areas were only supplementing deficiencies and guaranteed that whoever sows would reap, but some people still had doubts. At this time, the leadership carried out in-depth propaganda and withdrew eight million yuan from the harvest as compensation for the 58 households. This reassured the middle-peasant households. The work team also called for resettling landlords and rich peasants, and the masses said, "This is also right, we should give them the same share." Everyone decided to give them three million yuan of the harvest as resettlement funds. The landlords and rich peasants had living materials, so they were also stabilized and joined the mutual aid group. At this time, the leadership strictly pointed out that last year's production was completely delayed, and this year's spring plowing must not be delayed. At the same time, some of the harvest was appropriately distributed to the hired laborers, and everyone was relieved, and their thoughts turned to production. The middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired laborers were united again, completely restoring the attitude of one family. Landlords and rich peasants also entered the mutual aid group and participated in labor. Under the leadership of Comrade Hu Yuansuo, the mutual aid group was revived, divided into twenty-five mutual aid teams, each team with twenty or more people, without a fixed number, totaling six hundred fifty to seven hundred people. Women have their own mutual aid groups. Because the entire winter production was delayed, as soon as the mutual aid group started, everyone worked hard and showed great strength. In the previous period, continuous spring rains prevented anything from being done. The mutual aid group immediately proposed wasteland reclamation. Dong Qifu's team used nine people to reclaim fifteen mu of wasteland in three days. Song Baojin's team opened forty mu of riverside land, totaling over one hundred twenty mu of wasteland reclaimed by the entire mutual aid group. Fan Chunxi's team earned 400,000 yuan for the mutual aid group through production. Song Baojin's team thought of a way to dig mao di (night soil from latrine pits) to solve the fertilizer problem, obtaining 250 dan of mao di fertilizer. Each team within the mutual aid group subscribes to two newspapers—the Xin Dazhong Bao (New Masses Daily) and the Taiyue Xinhua Daily—the farmers are concerned about national affairs. They like to listen to newspaper readings and are learning to read and read newspapers. Many people who did not know how to read before can now slowly read the Xin Dazhong Bao within the mutual aid group. On March 24th and 25th, when the 19th Regiment of our army was ordered to pursue the Yan bandits and passed through Chengguan, the mutual aid group was eager to support the army. Without any orders, they automatically brought 1,000 jin of firewood and 500 jin of vegetables, boiling water in every household without fear of hardship. The town government immediately commended them on the public blackboard.

　　Under the leadership of Comrade Hu Yuansuo, the mutual aid group has also formulated this year's production work plan: 1. Dig a canal in Erdao River, connecting it to the Qin River, so that in rainy years, the water in the fields can be introduced into the canal and flow into the Qin River; in dry years, water from the Qin River can be introduced into the canal to irrigate the fields. The canal has now been dug for about two and a half li, and a piece of 500 mu of land has become the best farmland. 2. Consolidate the mutual aid organization. In the future, when participating in the war, the mutual aid group will guarantee that not a single mu of land will be left uncultivated. All problems will be solved by the mutual aid group, truly uniting hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants into one family within the mutual aid group. 3. Strengthen learning within the mutual aid group, with teams as units. The plan is to enable the people in the mutual aid group to read the Xin Dazhong Bao within half a year. 4. This year's crops, whether it is transplanting seedlings or weeding, will not miss the season. (Fan Liang)

　　沁源城关互助组
  　由垮台到复活
    【沁源消息】本县城关互助组，去年春夏都搞的很好；去年八月十四城关开始闹挤封建运动，斗争中错管制了五十八户中农，使中农都恐慌起来，有的说：“呀！靠几天就该收拾咱啦！”中农大半停止了劳动。雇贫都参加了“雇贫团”，和中农也分了家，大家既不团结，劳动都不进行。雇贫中有少数人，想凭果实来解决问题，也不注意劳动。互助组整个的垮了。整个的冬季生产没有进行，运输全没干，同时连积肥都没去作，今年春耕受到很大困难，春荒更形严重。在行署布告出来以后，大家虽然明白老区只是抽补，而且保证谁种谁收，但有些人还怀疑。领导上这时作了深刻的宣传，从果实中退出八百来万元作了五十八户的补偿，这样中农户整个的安心了。工作团又号召安置地主富农，群众都说：“这也是对的，咱也应与他同样的一份”。大家决定给他们三百万元的果实作为安置。地富有了生活资料，也就安定了，也参加了互助组。这时领导上严格指出去年生产完全耽误，今年春耕绝对不敢迟慢，同时给雇贫适当地分配了些果实，大家才都安了心，思想才转向生产，中农、贫农、雇农又都团结起来，完全恢复了一家人的态度，地主富农们也进了互助组，参加了劳动。在胡元锁同志的领导下，互助组又搞起来了，共分二十五个互助小组，每组二十几个人，没有一定，共计有六百五十人至七百人参加，妇女另有她们的互助组。因为整个的耽误了冬季生产，所以互助组一闹起来，便是七手八脚大干起来，表现了很大力量。在前一个时期，春雨连绵，啥也不能干，互助组立即提出开荒，董起富一组用九个人三天便刨了十五亩荒地，宋保金小组开了四十亩河滩地，共计整个互助组，共开荒一百二十来亩。樊纯喜小组给互助组搞生产，赚了四十来万元。宋保金小组因为肥料问题想了挖毛底的办法（毛坑底粪），搞了二百五十担毛底粪。互助组内每个小组都订有两份报纸——新大众报和太岳新华日报——农民们关心国家大事，他们爱听读报，又学着认字和看报，从前许多不认字的人，如今在互助组内都能慢慢地读新大众报了。三月二十四五那两天，我十九团等奉命追击阎匪，路过城关时，互助组拥军心切，没有任何命令，自动闹来一千斤柴五百斤菜，家家烧水不怕劳苦。镇公所在大众黑板上立刻作了表扬。
    在胡元锁同志的领导下，互助组还订出今年的生产工作计划：一、在二道河开一道渠，通入沁河，雨涝年景把地中之水引入渠，使流归沁河；天旱年景，引沁水入渠来浇地。现渠已开二里半的样子，一片五百亩的土地成了最好的田园。二、巩固互助组织，将来参战时，互助组要保证不荒一亩地，一切问题靠互助组解决，确实团结雇贫中农，在互助组内成为一家人。三、互助组内以小组为单位加强学习，计划用半年工夫，使互助组人都能读新大众报。四、今年的庄稼，不论拔苗锄草，都不叫误了季节。（凡亮）
