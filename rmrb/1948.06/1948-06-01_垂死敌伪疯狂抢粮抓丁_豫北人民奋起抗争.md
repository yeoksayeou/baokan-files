[Taihang News] Recently, the Chiang bandits in the Yexian area of northern Henan, who are about to die, have been frantically seizing grain and drafting soldiers. There are many tricks to grab soldiers. During the day or at night, they suddenly surround villages and conduct large-scale searches and captures; or they use the name of gathering members to hold meetings, with sentries standing guard around the perimeter, forming a "ring formation," and then surround the masses for conscription; or they disguise themselves as ordinary people and organize plainclothes teams to capture people in the course of mass activities. This forces the broad masses of people to become separated from their wives and children, and their families are destroyed. For example, if Chiang's 40th Division wants ten people, the township office will want twenty, and by the time it gets to the bao office, it becomes twenty-five. Those without money become soldiers, and those with money pay to redeem people. Liu Fengyi, who relies on his son for a living, has had his family begging for food since his son was captured. Once, Liu went to the enemy's barracks to see his child, but was pushed by the ferocious captain into a deep ditch and fell to his death. Other tragic incidents of suicide by hanging or cutting off fingers or toes due to being captured also occur everywhere. The young people captured by the enemy are often loaded onto planes and transported away after returning to Siguan. Before leaving, family members go to pray, but the enemy strictly forbids them from meeting, hitting the young men on one side and the family members on the other. When the young men board the plane, they cry for their parents on the plane, and those below cry for their children. Although it is a separation while still alive, it is like a farewell to the dead. In addition to seizing grain and drafting soldiers, they take everything they see. The puppet Wang Zi's entire unit went to Pangjiawan and swept away the masses' hoes, shovels, chickens, and bran nests. There is also a method of capturing people as collateral, throwing the captured men and women into hell (the enemy dug a large hell in Dougong stronghold that could hold six or seven hundred people). Those who want to get out of prison must pay a ransom in addition to paying for eight pounds of rice a day. In fact, many people starve to death there. Under the continuous and brutal ravages of the enemy's conscription and grain seizures, the masses have risen up in resistance and created many self-defense methods, taking up arms to fight the enemy. Many villages have formed guerrilla groups and secret joint defenses. When the enemy comes, they throw grenades or take up local weapons and persist in the struggle to protect grain and soldiers, making it difficult for the enemy to easily enter the villages. Once, the bandits of Cheng Daohe's unit were driven back two or three li. After Song Village was robbed by the enemy, the masses gathered and went to the enemy airfield to petition, shouting and yelling. In order to save face, the enemy released some livestock. Once, the enemy pretended to be our army and attacked Han Song Village. After the masses discovered this, they immediately took up local guns, spears, and pitchforks and shouted, scaring the enemy into fleeing.

　　垂死敌伪疯狂抢粮抓丁
  　豫北人民奋起抗争
    【太行消息】近来豫北邺县一带将要死亡的蒋匪，大肆抢粮抓叮其抓丁办法，花样颇多。白天或晚上突然包围村庄，大搜索大捕捉；或以召集会门开会为名，四周先站好岗哨，摆成“罗圈阵”，随即将群众围起进行挑兵；或化装老百姓；组织便衣队，在群众行动中进行捕捉。逼得广大人民妻离子散，家破人亡。如蒋匪四十师要十人，乡公所就要二十个，到保公所则成二十五个了。没钱的当兵，有钱的出款赎人。依靠儿子谋生的刘奉意，自他儿子被抓走后，家里人便都讨开饭了。有一次刘走到敌人的营房，想看看孩子，竟被凶恶的队长推到深沟绝崖下摔死了。其他因被抓而寻死上吊或断指削足的惨事，亦到处发生。敌人抓到的青年，往往回到四关后，便装上飞机运走。临行前，家里人都去祈求，敌人严禁见面，一面打青壮年，一面打家属。青壮年上机时，机上哭爹娘，下面哭孩子，虽为生离，却象死别。抢粮抓丁之外，见东西就拿。伪王自全部到庞家湾，把群众的锄、锹、鸡子、糠窝窝都一扫而光。还有一种是抓人抵押，把抓到的男女下到地狱内（豆公据点敌人挖了一个可容六、七百人的大地狱），想出狱者，除付身价外，还得出每天八斤米的饭钱，实际上那里困饿死的人很多。在敌人连续不断的残酷蹂躏抓丁、抢粮下，群众纷纷奋起反抗，并创造了许多自卫办法，拿起武器与敌展开斗争。有不少村庄已组成游击小组、秘密联防，敌人来了就打手榴弹，或拿起土武器，坚持斗争，保粮保丁，使敌不敢轻易进村。有一次匪程道和部就被赶了二、三里。宋村被敌抢劫后，群众集合起到敌飞机场请愿，乱喊乱叫，敌人为顾全面子，放下一些牲口。有一次敌人假装我军袭入韩宋村，群众发觉后即一齐拿起土枪、矛头和叉把乱喊叫，吓的敌人落荒而逃。
