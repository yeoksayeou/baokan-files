　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Comprehensive Shanghai newspaper reports: Anti-hunger struggles have once again erupted in academic circles in Changsha, Guilin, Shanghai, and other places. In mid-May, students at Hunan University in Changsha demanded the allocation of subsidized rice but received no results, so they went on strike and formed an "Anti-Hunger Congress" to petition the Chiang Kai-shek provincial government. Hunan has always been a famous rice-producing area in our country, but under the Chiang bandits' frantic requisition of military grain, the price of rice had risen to 4.1 million Chiang currency (hereinafter the same) per dan by the middle of last month, forcing students to fall into widespread hunger. Students at Guangxi University in Guilin went on strike again for three days starting on May 7th to fight for full public funding. The Shanghai Private Primary School Teachers Friendship Association, composed of more than 70 private primary school teachers, sent more than 20 representatives to petition the Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Council on May 21st, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government issue each teacher a relief fund of 10 million yuan and allocate food according to the same treatment as public education personnel. If there is no satisfactory reply, they will go on strike. Since the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Education Bureau restricted the tuition fees of private schools, the monthly income of private primary school teachers is only 4 to 5 million yuan. According to the Shanghai retail rice price of 6.5 million yuan per shi on May 22nd, each teacher's monthly income can only buy 60 to 70 jin of rice.

　　湘桂沪等地学界掀起反饥饿斗争
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合沪报消息：长沙、桂林、上海等地学界又掀起反饥饿斗争。长沙湖南大学学生五月中旬要求配售平价米未得结果全体罢课，并成立“反饥饿大会”，向蒋记省府请愿。湖南向为我国著名产米区，在蒋匪疯狂搜刮军粮下，上月中旬米价每担已涨达四百一十万元蒋币（下同），迫使学生普遍沦于饥饿。桂林广西大学学生为争取全面公费待遇，于五月七日起再度罢课三天。由七十余所私立小学教员组成的上海市私立小学教员联谊会，五月二十一日派出代表二十余人，向蒋记沪市参议会请愿，要求蒋记市府发给每一教员一千万元救济金，并按照公教人员同等待遇配给食物，如无圆满答复将实行罢教，自蒋记市教育局限制私立学校收费后，私小教员月入仅四、五百万元。按五月二十二日沪市零售米价每石六百五十万元计算，每一教员全月收入仅能购米六十至七十余斤。
