Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: Harbin's industry continues to develop rapidly, and the output of industrial finished products has increased sharply month by month. Currently, under the guidance and support of the democratic government's correct industrial and commercial policies, Harbin is increasingly developing into a production city. Capitalists are investing in industry and commerce or increasing capital to expand production. According to statistics, the Northeast Bank's Harbin branch issued a total of 753 million yuan in industrial and commercial loans in May (approximately 50 yuan of Northeast currency is equivalent to 1 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency). In the same month, 966 new industrial and commercial enterprises were started, of which 700 were industrial, with a total capital of over 2.22 billion yuan, and a total of 3,962 new employees and shop assistants were hired. 269 enterprises expanded production and operations, increasing capital by 755.5 million yuan. Among them, the iron industry alone increased capital by more than 31 million yuan. The pharmaceutical and hardware industries also increased a large amount of capital. Among the newly opened industrial and commercial enterprises, two machine dyeing factories invested more than 79 million yuan, and five hardware industries invested 185 million yuan. Other industries with capital of more than 20 million and 10 million yuan included battery, zinc oxide, enamel, leather, and canned food industries, totaling 55 enterprises. Among the newly opened industries, 50, including iron, leather, clothing, and rubber shoes, used electricity. The above-mentioned factories that expanded production purchased machines one after another. Zhonghe Iron Factory, for example, drew more than 10 million yuan from the 30 million yuan in sales revenue last year to expand production and bought two lathes. Due to the increase in products and brisk foreign sales, Harbin's total exports in May increased by 8.7 billion yuan compared with April. In particular, the surplus of industrial finished products increased by more than 5 billion yuan compared with April, a sharp increase of two times. The Harbin Democratic Government also helped the Harbin flour milling industry, which had oversupply, to invest its working capital in other industrial and commercial enterprises. The total amount of capital that has been invested and is being planned to be invested has reached more than 350 million yuan. For example, Yichangtai Fire Mill is preparing to open factories to manufacture toothbrushes, toothpaste, and toilet paper; Chengtayih Fire Mill invested 100 million yuan to purchase raw materials for Harbin factories in other places; and Tianxingfu Fire Mill has begun to operate livestock farms and is studying the production of chemical fabrics. In May, the democratic government advised and assisted certain industries that did not meet the needs of the new society, such as superstitious items and antiques, to shift to directions that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

　　哈市工业飞速发展
  　工业成品逐月猛增
    【新华社东北二十日电】哈尔滨市工业继续飞速发展，工业成品的出产逐月猛增。现哈市在民主政府正确工商业政策指导与扶植下，日益向生产城市方向发展。资本家纷纷投资工商业或增加资金扩大生产。据统计，五月份内东北银行哈市分行共发放了工商业贷款七亿五千三百余万元（东北币每元约合蒋币五十元）。同月内新开工商业即达九百六十六家，其中工业占七百家，资金共达廿二亿两千余万元，增雇职工店员共三千九百六十二人。扩大生产和营业的有二百六十九家，增加资金七亿五千五百余万元。其中仅十家铁工业即增资三千一百余万元。其他制药业、五金业等亦增加了大量资金。新开之工商业中，两家机器漂染厂即投资七千九百余万元，五家五金业资金一亿八千五百万元，其他资金在两千万与一千万元以上的还有电池、亚铅华、珐琅磁、皮革、罐头等业共五十五家。新开工业中有铁工业、皮革、被服、胶皮鞋等五十家使用电力。上述扩大生产的工厂纷纷添购机器，中和铁工厂即从去年售货所得的三千多万元中抽出一千多万元扩大生产，买了两个车床。由于产品增加，外销畅旺，故哈市总出口五月份即较四月份增加八十七亿元，特别是工业成品出超较四月份增加五十余亿元，即猛增二倍。哈市民主政府并帮助供过于求的哈市制粉业将其流动资金投入其他工商业，现已投资及正在计划投资的资金共达三亿五千余万元。如义昌泰火磨号正筹开制造牙刷、牙膏及草纸等工厂；成泰益火磨号投资一亿元去外地为哈市工厂采办原料；天兴福火磨号则已开始经营畜牧场，并正在研究制作化学布。民主政府五月份内曾劝告并协助若干不合新社会需要的行业如迷信品、古玩等业转向有利国计民生方向发展。
