　　Significant Results of the "Liu Bocheng Factory" Movement
　　Military Production Increased, Costs Reduced
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] At the summary conference of the "Liu Bocheng Factory" movement convened by a military industrial organ in the North China Liberated Area, the representatives earnestly and meticulously summarized the significant achievements and lessons learned from the past year's "Liu Bocheng Factory" movement, and held an awards ceremony. The various groups at the conference evaluated and discussed each factory's merits and demerits according to the original stipulated standards of quantity, quality, cost, administrative management, and guarantee work. The result was unanimous agreement that the glorious title of "Liu Bocheng Factory" should be awarded to Factory Two, and the personal inscription of General Liu Bocheng when he went south, "Improve the quality of military industry and increase the effectiveness of annihilation battles," as well as a bonus of 500,000 Jicha banknotes and more than 500 medals, were awarded to the factory. In terms of product quantity, the factory increased month by month, with the first quarter as 100, the second quarter increased to 140, and the fourth quarter increased to 231.4; in terms of cost, it decreased quarter by quarter, with the first quarter as 100, the second quarter decreased to 71.4, and the fourth quarter decreased to 33.5; in terms of product quality, normal quality was maintained throughout the year, and no problems occurred in front-line use. In addition, more than 100 tools were improved. In terms of factory management, the development of various tasks was relatively balanced, especially the organization of production and management of production were better. The tasks of each month were delivered on time throughout the year without delay; temporary shock tasks required by the superiors were also completed on schedule. This movement was a long-term production increase competition launched last spring. Its purpose was to meet the requirements of war development and to implement the instruction of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau to transform public factories from a complete supply system to enterprise management. It is different from the previous labor model movements and banner movements. It is not just a few people or a few factories that have made great progress. Each factory in this movement has a clear goal (the principles of more production, better quality, and lower cost set by Chairman Mao), and all have generally been involved in the movement, and all have generally made progress, avoiding the problems of individual prominence and simply competing for championships. In order to support the front line, voluntary processing, voluntary labor, and donations were also unprecedented during the year. The total voluntary labor of each factory was 28,484, and the total voluntary processing was 21,742; employees who have made special contributions and have been commended accounted for 71.4% of all employees, and Party members who have made contributions accounted for 18% of the employees who have made contributions. A total of 216 tools have been improved in each factory. During the year, the output of each factory generally increased, and the cost generally decreased. A group in the foundry department of a certain factory once completed the task for the whole month in five days. In the past, 2.5 catties of coal were used to melt 1 catty of iron; now 2 catties of coal can melt 1 catty of iron; a branch factory of a certain factory burned 3,000 catties of coal per day at the beginning, and later reduced it to 1,800 catties per day. The glycerin produced by a certain factory has excellent output and quality; in addition, each factory has many new creations, solved the difficulties of raw materials, and manufactured several weapons that could not be manufactured before. Some factories and some employees who were relatively backward in the past have also made significant progress this time. Generally speaking, the tasks given by the superiors have been completed and exceeded, and they have been able to cooperate with the development of the war situation and have played a certain role in the People's Liberation Army's transition from defense to offense. The meeting unanimously recognized that these achievements are the result of the efforts and cooperation of all workers and staff, which has strengthened the overall concept and the concept of mutual learning. The conference summarized several experiences: First, all work is for the quality, quantity, and low cost of production, and the three are indispensable. Second, it is necessary to promote the improvement of tools and working methods, which is the greatest saving and the main method of striving for low cost. Third, it is necessary to strengthen management and strict systems, and emphasize discipline, order, and scientific management to ensure enterprise management. In the future, factory staff at all levels must not say "probably" or "do not know" about the materials and personnel under their management. Fourth, the work of various departments and factories should cooperate and help each other, and the relationship between factories should focus on self-criticism, mutual consultation, and joint research and improvement. Representatives from various factories criticized and learned from each other at the conference and in group meetings. They also specially studied the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" editorial this year and other documents related to the workers' movement and military production. They learned a lot in terms of policy and technology. Some employee representatives said: "Attending this conference is equivalent to studying at a technical college for half a year." Everyone was not complacent, and made serious criticisms and self-criticisms about the fact that some factories were not well organized and equipped, and the cost accounting was not accurate. They also resolved to continue to exert initiative, creativity, study technology, master technology, improve technology, patiently train apprentices, strive in the direction of enterprise management, and strive to further expand the people's military industry. The final program of the conference was a solemn and grand award ceremony. The total bonus was one million Jicha banknotes, eight certificates of merit, and three thousand commemorative badges and commemorative books. There were also twelve prize banners presented by various agencies. Each factory received the prizes it deserved. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau, the Military Region, and the Border Government jointly sent a letter to all employees of Factory Two, congratulating them on winning the title of "Liu Bocheng Factory."

　　“刘伯承工厂”运动成果显著
  　军工产量增高成本降低
    【本报讯】华北解放区某军工机关所召开的“刘伯承工厂”运动总结大会上，代表们认真细致的总结了过去一年开展“刘伯承工厂”运动的显著成果和经验教训，并举行了授奖。大会各小组按照原来规定的数量、质量、成本、行政管理、保证工作五大项标准互相评议讨论，评定各厂的优劣，结果一致同意，“刘伯承工厂”这一光荣的称号应归于二厂，并把刘伯承将军南下时的亲笔题字“提高兵工质量，增大歼灭战的实效”及奖金冀钞五十万元及奖章五百多个奖给该厂。在产品数量上，该厂逐月增加，以第一季为一百，第二季即增至一四○，第四季即增至二三一·四；在成本上则逐季降低，以第一季为一百，第二季即降为七一·四，第四季降至三三·五；在出品质量上，全年都能掌握正常质量，前方使用未发生过一次毛病。另外还改进了工具一百多件。在工厂管理方面，各种工作的发展比较平衡，尤以组织生产及管理生产为较优，全年各月任务都能按期交货，从未延误；上级要求的临时突击任务也能如期完成。这次运动是去春发动的一个长期续持的增产竞赛，其目的是适应战争发展的要求并执行晋冀鲁豫中央局将公营工厂由完全的供给制度转入企业化的指示。它不同于过去的几次劳模运动、大旗运动，不止是少数人、少数厂进步大，各厂在这次运动中都有明确的目标（毛主席所订定产量多、质量好、成本低等方针），普遍都卷入了运动，也普遍都有了进步，避免了个人突出和单纯争锦标的毛病。为了支援前线，一年中自动加工、义务工、献金也是空前的。各厂合计共出义务工二八四八四个，自动加工二一七四二一个；曾立特功及曾得到表扬的职工占全体职工百分之七一·四，立功党员占立功职工的百分之十八。各厂改进工具共计二百一十六件。一年中各厂产量一般的都有增加，成本都有减低。某厂翻砂部一个组曾五天完成了全月任务，过去二斤半煤炭化铁一斤；现在能二斤化铁一斤；某厂一分厂烧锅炉，开始每天烧三千斤，后来降至一天一千八百斤。某厂出产的甘油产量、质量都很好；另外各厂还有不少新的创造，解决了原料的困难，制造出了以前不能制造的几种武器。有些厂，有些职工，过去比较落后的，这次也都有显著进步。总的说来，完成并超过了上级所给予的任务，而且能够配合战争形势的发展，对于人民解放军由防御转入进攻起了一定的作用。会上一致认识，这些成绩是全体工人职员努力合作的结果，加强了整体观念和相互学习的观念。大会上总结了几点经验：一、一切工作都为了生产的质量好、产量多、成本低，三个东西缺一不可。二、要发扬改进工具及工作方法，这是最大的节约，是争取成本低的主要方法。三、要加强管理、严密制度，强调有纪律、有秩序、科学化，以此保证企业化。工厂各级工作人员以后对自己管理的材料、人员等不能再说“大概”或说“不知道”。四、各部门各厂工作要互相配合互相帮助，厂与厂的关系应着重于自我批评，互相商量，共同研究改进。各厂代表在大会及小组会上互相批评学习，还特别学习了新华社今年“二七”的社论和其他有关职工运动与兵工生产的文件，在政策上、技术上都学到不少东西，有的职工代表说：“开这次会，等于读了半年工学院。”大家没有自满，对有些厂组织与努力配备不够好、成本核算不精确进行了严肃的批评和自我批评，并决心继续发挥积极性、创造性、钻研技术、熟练技术、提高技术，耐心培养学徒，本着企业化方向奋斗，为更加扩大人民的兵工事业而努力。大会的最后节目为庄严隆重的给奖仪式，奖金共有冀钞百万元，奖状八幅及纪念章纪念册各三千，并有各机关赠送的奖旗十二面，各厂都获得了应得的奖品，晋冀鲁豫中央局、军区和边府并联合致函二厂全体职工，祝贺其荣膺“刘伯承工厂”称号。
