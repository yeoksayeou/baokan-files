　　Convening a Solidarity Meeting of Poor Peasant, Middle Peasant, and Cadre
  　Ren Zhuang Branch Leads Sowing
    [Licheng News] Ren Zhuang Village in the Second District of Licheng has a foundation in production. However, since last winter, there has been no momentum in production. The main reason is that individual hooligans manipulated the "Poor Peasant League," rampaging through the village, gambling and drinking, not engaging in production. Not only did they fail to lead everyone in production, but they couldn't even manage their own production. They exposed the middle peasants' cooking pots, intimidated them, preventing them from selling grain, and assigned them excessive quotas of military shoes, causing panic and unease among the middle peasants, hindering their willingness to produce. In addition, the cadres were uncertain about the Party rectification's intentions, fearing they would fail the test, and laid down on the job, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm for production from anyone. After discovering these situations, the leadership immediately conducted separate education for cadres, poor peasants, and middle peasants, convening small meetings based on type to resolve ideological problems. At the branch meeting, they studied the letter to Party members, clarifying that Party rectification was for the purpose of transforming Party members. XXX said: "During the class demarcation last year, I was classified as a middle peasant, and I was asked to make a lot of military shoes. I am also a Party member, and I was very scared. I haven't attended a branch meeting in five months since last winter. I thought the branch and Party members were useless." XXX said: "I thought that by organizing a Poor Peasant League, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, we would slowly abandon the branch members and the branch." After everyone engaged in free thinking, each comrade conducted a self-criticism. Then, a meeting of poor peasants was held to discuss why the "Poor Peasant League" should be dissolved. Shen Guijin, a representative of poor and hired peasants, said: "Dissolving the Poor Peasant League is the right thing to do. Since the Poor Peasant League was organized last year, it hasn't been helpful in anything; when we suggested that the cadres took too many fruits from our labor, the cadres even held a grudge against us. Now that the Poor Peasant League has been dissolved, I worry about retaliation from the cadres. It's like a bee falling into a millstone, grinding us bit by bit. The Poor Peasant League asked for too many shoes from the middle peasants, preventing them from selling grain and eating noodles; we must correct this. Even cadres who have received years of education still make mistakes; how can we be without mistakes after being organized for only a few months? We just need to correct our mistakes!" Everyone agreed with his opinion, and the "Poor Peasant League" was formally announced as abolished. At the meeting of middle peasants, Shen Erhu said: "Since the 'Poor Peasant League' was organized, I have been constantly afraid. The poor and hired peasants wouldn't let me sell grain and eat noodles; I thought I was like a landlord." Shen Wenke said: "The higher-ups wouldn't let me get married; I thought I had become feudal." After understanding the specific situations of the three parties, a solidarity meeting of middle peasants, poor peasants, and cadres was held. After District Chief Sang talked to everyone about the policies regarding middle and poor peasants, everyone discussed and said: "The policies are really good!" Shen Anzhu (middle peasant) said: "Last winter, the transportation team deducted my wages. I thought I couldn't live anymore. After the landlords were overthrown, it was my turn. Who are the poor and hired peasants going to liberate? If the middle and poor peasants are one family, I can rest assured." Branch Secretary Shen Yuqin said: "We were short-sighted. Since organizing the poor and hired peasants, we have only cared about them, and it's no wonder the middle peasants have a gap with us; we abandoned them." Shen Jinhu, a poor peasant, said: "We poor and hired peasants must be fair and not act like lords. If we do bad things, the middle peasants should also oppose us." After the three parties' thoughts were clarified, the cadres promised not to retaliate, and the middle and poor peasants became very enthusiastic. The sowing work in the entire village has become a movement. Labor hero Shen Yuqin led the entire village, and the sowing work was completed by the 22nd. The entire village planted a total of 323 mu of millet, 236 mu of corn, and other sowing was also completed. They are now rectifying mutual aid teams and women's weaving groups to resolve deviations and leftover problems. Livestock are preparing to engage in sideline occupations.

　　召开贫农中农干部团结大会
  　仁庄支部领导下种
    【黎城消息】黎城二区仁庄村在生产上是有基础的。但去冬以来，生产没一点劲。主要原因是个别流氓操纵“贫农团”，在村上横行霸道，赌钱喝酒，不事生产，不用说带领大家生产，就连自己生产都搞不好。他们揭中农的锅，吓唬中农，不叫中农粜粮食，多派中农做军鞋，引起中农恐慌不安，不好好生产。加上干部摸不住整党的底，怕过关，躺倒不干，形成谁也不积极生产。领导上发现这些情况后，即对干部、贫农、中农进行分别教育，分类型召开小会议，解决思想问题。支部会议上研究了告党员书，弄清整党是为了改造党员后，×××说：“去年划阶级，我是中农，叫我多做军鞋，我又是党员，很害怕。去冬到现在五个月就没开过支部会，我心想支部和党员不顶啥事了。”×××说：“我心想组织起贫农团，以贫雇为骨干，就慢慢把支部党员扔掉了。”经各个同志开展自由思想后，各个同志都做了自我检讨。接着又开贫农会议，研究为啥要解散“贫农团”。贫雇代表申贵金说：“解散贫农团很对。自去年组织起贫农团，啥事也没顶；咱提了个干部多占果实，干部反而结住咱仇了。现在贫农团解散，我心想怕干部报复。马蜂跌到磨眼里，一折一折干咱哩”。“贫农团”多派中农鞋，不叫中农吃面粜粮食，咱一定要纠正。干部受了好几年教育还有错，咱组织起来几个月还能没错哩？有错改错就行！他的意见大家同意，“贫农团”就正式宣布取消了。中农开会时，申二虎说：“组织起‘贫农团’，我天天嫌怕，贫雇不叫我粜粮食吃面，我认为我和地主一样啦。”申文科说：“上级不叫我结婚，我心想我成了封建啦”。了解了三方面具体情况，就开了个中贫农与干部团结大会。桑区长给大家谈了中、贫农政策后，大家纷纷议论说：“政策就是好呀！”申安柱（中农）说：“去冬运输大队扣我工资，我心想可不能活啦，斗了地主就是我，贫雇翻身翻谁呀！要是中、贫农是一家，我就放了心。”支书申玉芹说：“咱就没有眼光。自组织起贫雇，咱是光看贫雇哩，不怨中农和咱有隔阂，是咱把中农扔掉啦”。贫农申进虎说：“咱贫雇做事要公正，不要和老爷一样。咱要做坏事，中农也要反对咱。”经三方面思想谈通后，干部提出保证不报复，中贫农劲头都很高，全村的下种工作形成运动。劳动英雄申玉芹领导全村，二十二号下种工作已全部完成。全村共种谷三二三亩，栽玉茭二三六亩，其他下种也全部完成。现正整顿互助组与妇女纺织组，解决纠偏与遗留问题，牲口正准备搞副业。（桑玉斌、王书令、程甫奇、张用周）
