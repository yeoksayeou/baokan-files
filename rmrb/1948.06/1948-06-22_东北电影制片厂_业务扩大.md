    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Telegram: The Northeast Film Studio's business is expanding daily. Since May of last year, it has successively produced six installments of newsreels (Democratic Northeast) and short films such as the puppet show (The Emperor's Dream), which have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Currently, in addition to screenings in major cities, the studio's films are also being shown in rotation in county towns and rural areas by five rear screening teams, and by twelve front-line screening teams that follow the army. The studio's news photography team, led by seventeen photographers, has dispatched nine teams to the front lines to capture the heroic combat deeds of the People's Liberation Army. Another three teams have been dispatched to the provinces of Hejiang, Songjiang, and Jilin to capture news materials related to rear area production and urban construction. Currently, the studio has nearly 500 staff and cadres. It has held two training courses to cultivate technical talent. The third course has now begun enrollment and will begin soon. In preparation for producing artistic films, the studio has organized a large number of directors, composers, actors, and production personnel to go deep into companies, factories, and hospitals to experience life and engage in creation. According to Yuan Muzhi, the head of the studio, the difficulties in the past with technical personnel and mechanical materials meant a large output was not achieved, but through the efforts of all comrades in the studio, these difficulties have been gradually overcome.
