  　Reply to Comrade Qi Hangzhi Regarding the Qianjin Shoe Factory Issue

    Is the Qianjin Shoe Factory actually "jointly established" by the Xingtai Trade Union and the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer (as Comrade Qi Hangzhi states in his letter), or was it organized by the Xingtai Trade Union with the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer investing in it (as Comrade Meng Fu states in his letter)? We hope comrades from both sides will continue to provide sufficient reasons and conduct discussions to further clarify the Party's policy.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor

    Comrade Qi Hangzhi's opinion on the profit distribution of the Qianjin Shoe Factory in Xing City, published on page one of the People's Daily on May 19th, does not reflect the actual situation. The Qianjin Shoe Factory was organized under two conditions: First, after accepting 90,000 pairs (not 100,000 pairs) of shoes from the Jinnan Administrative Office, the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer was unable to complete the task and requested the City Trade Union to organize shoe workers to establish a new shoe factory to help complete the task. Second, at that time, there were hundreds of shoe workers in Xingtai County who were in the countryside. Organizing them would not only help the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer complete the shoe-making task but also develop the shoe industry in Xing City and solve the livelihoods of some urban residents. Considering this situation, the City Trade Union, after discussion and decision by the Municipal Party Committee, jointly issued an advertisement with the Xingtai County Relief Association to recruit shoe workers and organize the Qianjin Shoe Factory. At that time, the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer was willing to invest in shares with a depreciated value of some shoe-making materials. The organization, leadership, and management were all the responsibility of the City Trade Union and the workers. Personnel from the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer worked at the Qianjin Shoe Factory as employees. This is how the Qianjin Shoe Factory was organized. That is to say, the nature of the Qianjin Shoe Factory is that it was established by the trade union leading the workers. The Shengli Shoe Manufacturer only invested in shares. It was not established by the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer, and the City Trade Union was only responsible for recruiting workers. Therefore, this factory is not a labor-capital cooperation enterprise established by the capitalist, nor is it as Comrade Qi Hangzhi said: "Based on all the cadres, workers, tools, and materials of the original Shengli Shoe Manufacturer... the trade union is only responsible for convening workers." This statement recognizes the nature of the Qianjin Shoe Factory as a labor-capital cooperation enterprise established by the capitalist, or makes it a nature of the capitalist hiring workers. This misrepresents the nature of the factory, and if the nature of the factory is misunderstood, it will be impossible to clarify whether the profit distribution is correct or not.
    Regarding the investment in shares by the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer, it was initially said that the tools and materials were worth a total of 7 million to 10 million yuan (because they couldn't calculate the accounts at the time), and at least 7 million yuan was required, with a 20% dividend. Later, after Comrade Qi Hangzhi came to discuss it, it was changed to a 25% dividend, and a contract was signed after the discussion. Afterwards, the tools, materials, and four machines of the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer were calculated, totaling more than 5.55 million yuan. Although it was less than 7 million yuan, in order to take care of the relationship between the two parties, the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer was still given a 25% dividend. At the end of six months, the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer only received 13,893,028 yuan. After the accounts were settled, the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer withdrew its original investment in full. Now the Qianjin Shoe Factory is completely owned by the workers themselves. This shows that the amount of the dividend was agreed upon by both parties. If the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer was unwilling at the time, it could have not invested. Since it invested, it was voluntary by both parties, and there was a contract as evidence. Why is it complaining about the small dividend now? The investment of more than 5 million yuan received a dividend of 7 million yuan. Isn't this taking care of the investor's interests? How much more care is needed?
    The salary of the Qianjin Shoe Factory cannot be compared with privately operated factories in general. Because first, it is managed and operated by the workers themselves. Some cadres of the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer are only employees. Second, the shoes made are military shoes contracted by the Jinnan Administrative Office, and 22 jin of rice are given for each pair of shoes made and delivered. In order for the investors to receive dividends, save employee consumption, and accumulate capital to build the factory, the factory adopted piece-rate wages. The general labor cost for making a pair of shoes does not reach 22 jin of rice. The savings from the dividends, in addition to the dividend paid to the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer, should naturally belong to the workers of the factory and the workers outside the factory. If we look at the wages of this factory according to the standards of general private or public enterprises, we will naturally not understand it.
    The issues of workers' education fees and social insurance funds are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Taihang District Industrial Corporation in the past: 2% is deducted for education fees and 5% is deducted for insurance funds, which are deducted from the entire dividend. 4,536,094.95 yuan should have been deducted, but only 3,469,440 yuan was actually deducted. If the deduction is inappropriate, it is a matter of reviewing the entire method of deducting workers' education fees and social insurance funds, and it is not done specifically to reduce the dividend of the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer. As for saying that the trade union sent cadres to educate the workers to "struggle against the cadres of the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer," or saying that "the Shengli Shoe Manufacturer is a capitalist," etc., such situations have not yet been found. We will continue to investigate.

### 邢市职工会　关于前进鞋工厂问题答齐航之同志

　　邢市职工会
  　关于前进鞋工厂问题答齐航之同志
    前进鞋工厂究竟是邢台职工会与胜利鞋庄“合组”（齐航之同志信中这样说）的，还是邢台职工会组织起来而由胜利鞋庄入股（孟甫同志信中这样说）呢？希双方同志继续提出充分理由，进行讨论，从中来更加说明党的政策。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    人民日报五月十九日一版载齐航之同志对邢市前进鞋工厂分红的意见，所说情况不符事实。前进鞋工厂是在两个条件下组织起来的：第一、是胜利鞋庄接受冀南行署九万双（不是十万双）鞋子后，完不成任务，要求市职工会组织鞋工人成立新鞋厂，帮助完成任务。第二、当时邢台县有几百在乡鞋业工人，组织起来，既可帮助胜利鞋庄完成做鞋任务，又可发展邢市鞋业，解决一部分市民群众的生活。市工会考虑了这个情况，经过市委讨论决定：联合邢台县救联会共同发出广告，招收鞋工人，组织前进鞋工厂。当时胜利鞋庄愿以一部做鞋材料折价投资入股。组织领导及经营管理，均由市工会与工人负责。胜利鞋庄的人员到前进鞋工厂作为雇员。前进鞋工厂就这样组织起来了。这就是说，前进鞋工厂的性质是工会领导工人开办的。胜利鞋庄仅仅是投资入股，并非属胜利鞋庄开办，市工会帮助招收工人性质。所以这个工厂不是资方开办的劳资合作性质，更不是如齐航之同志所说：“以原胜利鞋庄的全体干部工人与一切工具材料为基础………职工会仅负召集工人的责任”。这种说法是把前进鞋工厂的性质认成资方开办的劳资合作性质，或弄成资方雇佣工人开办的性质。这样就把工厂性质弄错了，弄错工厂性质，就无法弄清分红对否。
    关于胜利鞋庄的投资入股，最初说的是工具材料共折七百万元到一千万元（因为他们当时算不清帐），最少须够七百万元，按百分之二十分红。后经齐航之同志来谈，改为分红百分之二十五，并在谈后订立合同，以后把胜利鞋庄工具材料及四部机器算清，共值五百五十五万余元，虽不足七百万元，为照顾双方关系，仍给胜利鞋庄按百分之二十五分红。六个月终，胜利鞋庄只分得一千三百八十九万三千零二十八元，算帐后，胜利鞋庄将原投资全部抽走，现前进鞋工厂已完全为工人自己的。这里说明，分红多少是双方议定的，如当时胜利鞋庄不自愿，即可不投资，既投资，又是双方自愿，又订合同为凭据，为什么又嫌分红少呢？五百多万投资分到七百万红利，这不是照顾投资者利益吗？再怎样照顾呢？
    前进鞋工厂的工资是高是低，不能与一般私人经营的工厂去比。因为第一、是工人自己经营管理的。胜利鞋庄一些干部只是雇员。第二、做的鞋子是揽冀南行署的军鞋，每双鞋做成交到即可给二十二斤米。工厂内为使投资者分到红，并节约出雇员消耗及积蓄资本建设工厂，采取按件计工。一双鞋子做下来，一般工资成本达不到二十二斤米。节约红利，除胜利鞋庄分红外，所余红利自然应归本厂工人及厂外工人所有。如按一般私资或公资经营的工厂去看这个工厂的工资，自然就想不通了。
    工人教育费社会保险金问题，是按过去太行区实业公司规定办法：教育费抽百分之二，保险金抽百分之五，从整个红利中抽的，应抽四百五十三万六千零九十四元九毛五分，实抽三百四十六万九千四百四十元，抽出的如有不合适，是检讨整个工人教育费和社会保险金抽的办法问题，并不是专为减少胜利鞋庄分红而这样做的。至于说工会派进干部教育工人“斗争胜利鞋庄干部”，或说“胜利鞋庄是资本家”等等，现在尚未检查出这种情形，我们当继续检查。
