　　County Committee Personally Leads
  　Quwo Returns Shops
    [Taiyue News] In Quwo Chengguan, a portion of industry and commerce were wrongly struggled against in the past. The Quwo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally led the correction. Around May 1st, meetings were held separately with industry and commerce representatives and Chengguan street cadres to publicize policies and discuss methods of returning properties. At that time, some cadres could not understand. Some said, "If the struggle was wrong in the past, then just let it go! Just don't struggle against them again in the future! We led people to struggle in the past, and now we are leading the return of things, we really don't have the face to tell people!" Some said, "The struggle was our mistake, but they also have mistakes, so only half should be returned!" Wu Zhankui, chairman of the West Street Farmers' Association, falsely reported that the fruits had already been distributed, and would not return them (actually they were not distributed). The West Street Farmers' Association, upon hearing the news of the return, even wanted to take the opportunity to grab something, demanding 100,000 yuan in dividends from Yonghecheng. The East Street Farmers' Association wanted to transport the cloth stored in Wanhechang to a certain state for sale. The leadership, through enlightenment and guidance, began to correct these erroneous ideas. Some streets even formulated disciplines to ensure the orderly return of properties. The First District Street cadres' meeting stipulated: (1) No lavish eating and drinking, and no arbitrary spending. They should also operate well and wait for organized return. (2) For lost or damaged property, it is necessary to ask the higher authorities to decide on the handling method. (3) Announce the cancellation of the "struggle object" label for wrongly struggled households, restore their civil rights, and cancel control. On the 5th, the county committee led the relevant departments to carry out the return. The first step was to return factories and shops to the original owners for management. The consumed or used property would be discussed and resolved later according to the situation. Now, one tobacco shop, one silverware shop, one grocery store, two vegetable shops, two pharmacies, one weaving factory, one silk thread shop, two oil mills, one Beijing goods shop, and one weights and measures bureau have been returned, totaling thirteen. Among them, the largest are Qian Yuxu Pharmacy, which has been established for over a hundred years, and Wanhechang Weaving Factory, with assets valued at 10 million yuan, and Kechang Silverware Bureau, which sells in the three provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan. This is just the beginning of the correction, but the mood of industry and commerce is immediately different. All returned households are happy and plan to expand their business. Duan Zimei, manager of Fuchanggong, sent a letter to Ji Youyu, manager of Zhonghe Yong Grocery Store who fled to Xi'an, asking him to return quickly. After the return, Yonghecheng immediately added four workers, producing 4,000 more small packs of cigarettes per day. Jiao Yunhe, manager of Wanhechang, also personally went to buy new knitting machine oil on the 19th and also plans to add workers to expand production. Fa Shengkui made 4,200 jin of vinegar in four months during the Farmers' Association's confiscation period. Twelve days after the return, he made 3,300 jin of vinegar. Worker Wu Xingwang said: "In the past, struggling against one household was like struggling against ten households, and everyone had no intention of working. Now, we will have a good time."

　　县委亲自领导
  　曲沃退还商铺
    【太岳消息】曲沃城关过去错斗了一部分工商业，中共曲沃县委亲自领导纠正。“五一”前后，分别开了工商业及城关街干部会议，宣传政策，讨论退还办法。当时有些干部想不通，有的说：“过去斗的不对就算了，以后不要再斗就行啦！咱领导人家斗争过，今天又领导退东西，真没脸给人家说！”有的说：“斗争是咱的错误，可是他也有错误，退时也只能退一半！西大街农会主席吴占魁假报果实已经分配，不给退（实际没分）。西大街农会听到要退的消息，还想趁机捞摸一把，要到永和成抽十万元的红利。东大街农会想把万合长的存布运到某州去卖。领导上对这些错误思想，经过启发诱导，开始纠正了。有的街还订出了纪律，保证有秩序的退还。一区街干会上规定了：（一）不许大吃大喝，随便开支，还应好好经营，听候有组织的退还。（二）已经损失的财物，须请示上级决定处理办法。（三）宣布取消错斗户“斗争对象”的帽子，恢复公民权，取消管制。五日，县委便领导各有关部门去退还。第一步先退工厂商店由原业主接管，动用或消耗了的财物，随后按情况商量办法，再行解决。现在已退还的烟房一家，银妆局一家，杂货铺一家，菜铺二家，药铺二家，织工厂一家，丝线铺一家，油坊二家，京货铺一家，度量衡局一家，共计十三家。其中最大的有开设百多年的谦育旭药庄，和资产价值一千万元的万合长织工厂，行销晋陕豫三省的克昌银妆局。这只是开始纠正，但工商业者情绪立刻不同，退还各户都高兴，计划扩大营业。福昌公经理段子美给逃往西安的中和永杂货铺经理吉友予捎信，让他赶快回来。永和成在退还后马上添了四个工人，每天多产小包烟四千包，万合长经理焦运河，也在十九日亲到新买织袜针机器油，也打算再添工人往大里闹。法生魁在农会没收期内，四个月做醋四千二百斤，退还后十二天中，就做醋三千三百斤。工友吴兴旺说：“过去斗一家，就顶斗十家，大家都没心思干，现在就要好好的闹了。”
