Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 15th—The Direct Unit of the Central Plains Military Region is actively helping local farmers with the wheat harvest. The assistance work was preceded by good mobilization and organization, truly achieving the goal of helping farmers who lacked or had no labor to harvest cleanly, not accepting meals from farmers, and not damaging farmers' tools, etc. In the first three days alone, statistics showed that 1,900 laborers participated, harvesting more than 2,400 mu of wheat, and also helped farmers pull wheat, stack wheat, thresh, and carry water. Each unit also ground rice and flour on its own to save civilian labor and complete the wheat harvest. Everyone was very active in helping with the harvest. One comrade had seven blisters on his hands, but still insisted on harvesting 4.5 mu of wheat.

  　帮助驻地农民麦收
    【新华社中原前线十五日电】中原军区直属队，积极帮助驻地农民麦收。助收工作事先经过很好的动员和组织，真正做到帮助缺少和没有劳动力的农民割收干净，和不接受农民饭食招待，不损坏农民工具等，仅头三天统计，就有一千九百个劳力参加，割麦二千四百余亩，并帮助农民拉麦、垛麦、打场和担水等。各单位并自行推米磨面，以节约民力，完成麦收。助收中大家非常积极，某同志手上打了七个泡，还坚持割麦四亩半。
