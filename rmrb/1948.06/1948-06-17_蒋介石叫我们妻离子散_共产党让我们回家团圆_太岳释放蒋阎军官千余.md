　　“Chiang Kai-shek made us lose our families
　　The Communist Party lets us go home for reunion”
	Taiyue releases over a thousand Chiang-Yan officers
	[Taiyue, 14th dispatch] The Taiyue Military Region released 1,521 captured Chiang-Yan military officers including Chen Shuxiu, a major deputy battalion commander of the Yan bandit 135th Brigade, and He Gong, a major deputy regimental commander of the Yan bandit 39th Division, and others. When they first arrived, some of them were deeply deceived in the past and were suspicious of us, and many concealed their ranks and positions. However, after a short period of study, they personally experienced that the People's Liberation Army was indeed lenient towards them, from respecting them in terms of personality to taking care of them in life. In particular, the sincere help of the PLA staff helped them to understand the truth, distinguish right from wrong, and recognize the crimes of the Chiang-Yan bandit gang. Therefore, they also said what they did not dare to say in the past. For example, Chen Shuxiu, a major deputy battalion commander of the 135th Brigade, and Cheng Wanli, a major staff officer of the news office, concealed their names and positions when they first arrived, but later voluntarily told everything and felt happy. Wan Liffei, an intelligence officer of the Youth Army 206, also dared not reveal his true situation when he first arrived. After studying, he regretfully said to others: "I joined the Youth Army in order to get promoted and make a fortune, and to go to university in the future, but I was deceived. Chiang Kai-shek used us as cannon fodder. I will never do this again when I go home this time. I will start a new life!" Especially after studying our land reform and industrial and commercial policies, they all said: "The Communist Party implements such good policies, the revolution will succeed quickly, and Chiang Kai-shek will collapse even faster!" After they visited the Yangcheng Mule and Horse Fair, they were even more moved and said: "Hundreds of thousands of people in the Liberated Areas are truly free and happy, and there is not a single police officer or military policeman, but the order is so good." He also said: "In the past, people outside said that the people in the Liberated Areas were not free and that there was no one there. That's utter nonsense!" At the farewell meeting, someone said: "I never thought there would be today. Chiang Kai-shek made us lose our families, but the Communist Party let us go home for reunion." They also wrote their inner thoughts on the wall newspapers. He Gong, a major deputy regimental commander of the 39th Division, wrote: "I was wounded and came to the Training Regiment. Before my wound healed, the battalion commander personally came to comfort me and sent me to the hospital. The nurses and doctors treated me warmly and diligently. In a few days, my wound healed. Thinking back to my time in the hospital in Taiyuan, I saw six wounded soldiers die within ten days due to poor treatment. Comparing these two situations, it is clear who is good and who is bad." An upper lieutenant instructor of the 269th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade wrote: "Today, we must strengthen our outlook on life and not be tempted by money and official positions, lest we perish with Chiang Kai-shek." Some people further expressed their attitude, "We must fight to the end for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation." The People's Liberation Army gave them sufficient travel expenses and sent them home. At the final farewell, they unanimously expressed that they would never oppose the people, and enthusiastically agreed: "See you in Taiyuan!" or "See you in Xi'an!" "See you again after making contributions to the people!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, see you again!"
	[Ji-Lu-Yu, 15th dispatch] On June 6th, our Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region released seven Chiang army officers including Lu Xueyin, an officer of the 66th Regiment of the Chiang army 55th Division. They held a simple forum before their departure. "The Northwest Army is a miscellaneous army and is the most excluded in Chiang Kai-shek's army." They said in unison. This is their painful experience of more than ten years. "After Chiang Kai-shek launched the treasonous civil war, he put the miscellaneous 55th Division on the front line of the civil war. The more they fought, the fewer they became. Now there are only five regiments left. What will be the result if the 55th Division continues like this?" Chen Zhengping, an upper lieutenant secretary of the 86th Regiment Headquarters, said: "The more they fight, the fewer they become, and eventually they will all be wiped out." Then platoon leader Lu Xueyin resentfully said: "It's so unjust to die for Chiang Kai-shek in a treasonous war!" The Northwest Army can only break away from Chiang's camp and stand on the side of the people to serve the people. This is the bright road, they have deeply felt this. But they also said: "Our senior officers are still only concerned about their current official positions and enjoyment, and cannot see the development and changes of society. I am afraid it will be too late to regret it later." Chen Zhengping wrote his feelings: "The People's Liberation Army's lenient policy towards prisoners, not killing or insulting them, and treating them favorably, makes ambitious young people repent and no longer want to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. The Liberated Areas implement land reform, so that whether landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, or poor peasants, all till their own land. Chiang army officers and soldiers can also be allocated land when they return home. It is true that everyone has a job and everyone has food to eat. After I am released this time, I will go home to do a small business and will never join the Chiang army again." Platoon leader Zhang Shixin left a message: "In the future, I will do propaganda work for the People's Liberation Army so that people in the Chiang area can understand the various policies of the Liberated Areas, such as the lenient policy and the land policy."

　　“蒋介石叫我们妻离子散
  　共产党让我们回家团圆”
    太岳释放蒋阎军官千余
    【太岳十四日电】太岳军区释放被俘蒋阎军官阎匪一三五旅少校副营长陈书秀、阎匪卅九师少校团副贺功等以下一千五百廿一人。他们初来时有些因过去受蒙蔽太深，对我们怀疑，不少人隐瞒了自己的官阶和职务，但经过短期学习后，亲身体验到解放军确实对他们宽大，从人格上的尊重到生活上的照顾，特别是解放军工作人员对他们的诚恳帮助，让他们认识真理、辨明是非，认清蒋阎匪帮统治的罪恶；因此，过去不敢说的话也说了。如一三五旅少校副营长陈书秀、新闻室少校干事程万里，刚来时隐瞒姓名和职务，后来自愿的把一切都说出来了，精神也愉快了。青年军二零六谍谋报员万里飞初来时也是不敢暴露自己真实情况，学习以后他后悔的对人说：“我参加青年军是为了升官发财，将来升大学，那知是受了骗，蒋介石是拿我们当炮灰，这次回家再也不干这事了，要重新做人！”尤其在学习我们土地改革与工商业政策后，都说：“共产党实行这样好的政策，革命很快就可以成功，蒋介石完蛋的更快了！”他们参观了阳城骡马大会以后，更感动的说：“解放区成千成万人民真正自由幸福，一个警察宪兵也没有，而秩序这样良好。”他又说：“过去在外边说解放区老百姓不自由啦，没人啦，真是混帐话！”这次临别时在大会上有人说：“我就想不到还有今天，蒋介石叫我们妻离子散，共产党却让我们回家团圆。”在墙报上也写出了自己的心里话，三十九师少校团副贺功写道：“我负了伤来到教导团，伤口未好，大队长亲自来安慰我，把我送到医院，看护和医生个个都对我热勤招待，不多几天我的伤口就好了。想起在太原住医院时，十天内我就看到六个伤兵因治疗不善而死了，这样对照看来，谁好谁不好一目了然。”一二三旅二六九团上尉指导员写道：“今天要坚定自己的人生观，不为金钱官职所引诱，免得和蒋介石同归于尽。”还有人进一步表示自己的态度，“要为中国人民解放事业奋斗到底。”解放军给他们发了充足的路费，送他们回家。最后握别时，他们一致表示永远不反人民，更热情的相约：“太原见”或“西安见”！“为人民立功后再见”！“打倒蒋介石再见”！
    【冀鲁豫十五日电】六月六日，我冀鲁豫军区释放蒋军五五师六六团军官卢学寅等七名，他们临行前举行了简单的座谈会。“西北军是杂牌，在蒋介石军队中最受排斥。”他们同声这样说，这是他们十多年来亲身的痛苦体验。“蒋介石掀起卖国内战后，把杂牌五五师放到内战最前线，越打越少，到现在只剩了五个团。五五师这样继续下去，将有个什么样的结果呢？”八六团团部上尉书记陈政平说：“越打越少，最后必然打光。”接着排长卢学寅怨恨的说：“替蒋介石打卖国仗死了多冤枉啊！”西北军只有脱离蒋贼的阵营站到人民方面来为人民服务才是光明大道，他们已深深有这样感觉。但他们又说：“我们的高级长官还在只顾眼前的官位和享受，看不到社会的发展变化，恐怕以后后悔就晚了。”陈政平写出他的感想：“人民解放军对俘虏的宽大政策，不杀不辱，并且优待，使有志青年痛改前非，再不愿替蒋介石当炮灰。解放区实行土地改革，无论地主、富农、中农、贫农均使其耕者有其田，蒋军官兵回家以后也可分土地，真是人人有工作，人人有饭吃，我此次被释放后，回家作小生意，决不再参加蒋军。”排长张士信留言道：“今后要给人民解放军作宣传工作，使蒋区的人们了解解放区的各种政策，如宽大政策、土地政策等。”
