Opinions of the District Party Committee Office

    The District Party Committee Office's opinion on the solution of the problem of supporting labor and tilling land in place of those on official duty in Mudan Street is as follows: Mudan Street's approach to solving the problem of supporting labor and tilling land in place of those on official duty through full democratic discussion by the masses and following the mass line is relatively successful. The burden on the masses is fair and reasonable, and the masses and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are also satisfied. Village cadres and militia also believe that it should be resolved practically and realistically according to the laws and regulations and the specific situation of the village so that everyone is satisfied. In terms of methods and viewpoints, Mudan Street has solved it very well. There is much work to be done on how to reduce the burden on the masses, correct the policy on burdens, remove obstacles to production, and develop production, so as to have sufficient manpower and material resources to support the victory of the war. In addition to supporting labor and tilling land in place of those on official duty, problems such as compulsory orders in mutual aid groups, and unreasonable and unfair allocation of manpower and animal power for corvée are urgent problems that the masses need to solve at present. Localities should do more arduous investigation and research work in this area and find practical solutions. Mudan Street has raised and initially solved this problem, which is worthy of being provided for everyone's research, but they discussed it before the Administrative Office's decree on supporting labor and tilling land in place of those on official duty was promulgated. Now the Administrative Office has made some provisions on supporting labor and tilling land in place of those on official duty. The comrades leading the work in Mudan Street should also put this new provision to the masses for discussion.

　　区党委办公室意见
    区党委办公室对牡丹街解决支差代耕问题的意见如下：牡丹街在解决支差代耕问题时，经过群众充分民主讨论，走群众路线，是比较成功的。群众负担公平合理了，群众与抗属也满意，村干民兵也认为应该依照法令，根据该村具体情况，实事求是具体解决，使大家都满意。在方法上观点上，牡丹街都解决的很好。关于如何减轻群众负担，端正负担政策，解除生产障碍，发展生产，以便有足够的人力物力支援战争胜利，这方面要作的工作是很多的，除支差代耕外，如互助组的强迫命令，派差人力畜力负担不合理不公平，都是目前群众迫切需要解决的问题。各地应在这方面做更多艰苦调查研究工作，和寻找切实解决的方法。牡丹街是提出了并初步解决了这一问题，值得提供大家研究，但他们是在行署支差代耕法令公布前讨论的，现在行署对支差代耕已有所规定，领导牡丹街的工作同志，尚应将这一新的规定在群众中提出讨论。
