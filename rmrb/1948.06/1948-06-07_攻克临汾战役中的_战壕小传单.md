In the Battle of Linfen, the People's Liberation Army on the front lines created trench leaflets, which proved to be the most effective method of education and mobilization in the long trench warfare. After the troops entered the trenches, they were scattered in the positions and air-raid shelters all day long, making it inconvenient to continue the original forms of learning, cultural activities, and entertainment. The troops felt that life was monotonous and boring. Some units set up clubs in the trenches and produced bulletin boards. However, the clubs were too crowded and did not meet the requirements of decentralized concealment. Therefore, many small-scale cultural and entertainment activities were developed among the soldiers, with rhythmic storytelling being the most popular. They even became accustomed to expressing all aspects of life, learning, and combat experience in this form. At the same time, in a desperate struggle, the enemy resorted to uncommon weapons such as poison gas bombs and white phosphorus bombs. The troops urgently needed to learn how to deal with them, so the leadership used this form to conduct education and mobilize the troops to find solutions. The "Zhengzhou" unit took the lead in using this form to conduct education on the three bombs: "illumination bombs, white phosphorus bombs, and poison gas bombs." Their method was to mobilize the troops to discuss the properties of the three bombs and our countermeasures. Then, they summarized the information and wrote it into simple and easily understandable leaflets, which were distributed to each trench. After these leaflets were distributed to the troops, they were well received by the officers and soldiers, helping them to quickly eliminate their ideological concerns about the three bombs. Soldier Wei Xueguang said, "After reading the leaflet, I knew that illumination bombs do not hurt people and can also help identify terrain. I am not afraid at all." The leaflet about illumination bombs said: "Illumination bomb, not useful, the outside is a tin bucket, does not explode, does not hurt people, only to illuminate at night. Don't move when it doesn't land, take advantage of the brightness to see the terrain; when it goes out, quickly advance." The anti-gas leaflet put forward various methods of gas defense: "Prepare lime water on the position, carry soap and towels with you, if you find the enemy releasing poison gas, fold the towel six times vertically and horizontally, or wet it with lime water, soap water is even safer; wet it well and cover your mouth and nose, poison gas cannot get in; if lime and soap are not convenient, washing the towel with urine can also work, if there is no time, use wet soil to cover it, wheat seedlings and green grass can be used, twist and block the mouth and nose; if you can run to high ground, it is also safe; if there is enough time, use bombs and explosives to disperse it; wet soil can also bury it, splashing water can also drown it, use broken shoes and socks to cover the mouth, the method is simple and convenient. We have many methods, the enemy's poison gas is in vain." After reading the anti-gas leaflet, soldier Li Shihua said, "The enemy's poison gas bombs are useless, we have many ways to deal with them."

After the three-bomb education, the leadership found that trench leaflets were the most effective way to carry out political work in the trenches. Therefore, based on the current central work of the troops and the various combat methods devised by the soldiers, they consciously and systematically produced and distributed them. For a time, they became popular in various units.

When the troops were about to adopt tunnel blasting to destroy the enemy's bunkers, two kinds of trench leaflets were produced. One wrote: "We have airplanes, only for the enemy to ride, not flying in the sky, but drilling underground; infantry are like runways, engineers drive them, when the enemy sits on them, they will all die happily." The other wrote: "The enemy is afraid of our airplanes, always wanting to avoid riding them, drilling on the ground to listen with jars, and sending out soldiers to fight. We have a group here, experts in building airplanes, not afraid of sweating in the soil, thinking of ways according to the situation, calculating accurately without deviation, carefully and boldly digging in, building the airplane for him, the enemy has no choice but to ride it." After seeing these two leaflets, everyone's confidence in the tunnels was increased, and the morale of the tunnel operation was particularly high.

Based on the characteristics of the siege battle and the experience of attacking outer strongholds, it was necessary to strengthen small-group actions. Therefore, the command of the squad leader was a very important issue. Several squad leaders with good command skills and great combat achievements were called together to discuss the issue of squad leader command. Based on the results of the discussion, a leaflet was written, which was then taken to the company to solicit opinions from some squad leaders and soldiers. After modification, it was printed into leaflets and distributed. The squad leader comrades cherished it like a treasure, and even the platoon leaders scrambled to read it. A deputy platoon leader, Zhu Qingyun, said, "This solved my command position problem and helped me a lot. I hope to print more in the future." After receiving it, neighboring units immediately reprinted and distributed it.

Before the general attack on the East Gate of Linfen, in order to improve the tactical actions of the assault team and the depth combat troops, two leaflets, "Steel Nails and Steel Cones" and "How to Fight in Depth," were written. The former succinctly and powerfully wrote: "The assault team is like a steel nail, nailed to the breakthrough point, stronger than Mount Tai; the assault team is like a cone tip, inserted into the enemy's heart, drilling straight in, taking a step forward and nailing a nail, no retreat, only advance. Stab a cone, smell the blood, eat a delicious meal."

The first two sections of the leaflet "How to Fight in Depth" are: "(1) Depth combat must be bold, attack fiercely and rush in, quickly confuse the enemy, not letting the bastards catch their breath, mixing the enemy and us together, the command must be more resourceful, be careful and bold, use more tricks to bluff them, and do not fight a dumb battle, shouting can be as effective as a machine gun, confusing the enemy, and capturing even if there are many people. (2) When fighting in depth, be dispersed, don't squeeze together, if you encounter few enemies, simply eat them up; if you encounter many enemies, confrontation is useless, flank them from the side. Attack from the front with firepower, pinch them with tongs, see what they have, they can't run, let me do what I want."

Hou Jin, the political instructor of a certain battalion, said, "After reading the leaflet 'How to Fight in Depth,' I solved a problem of confrontation in the depth development."

As soon as the leaflets were distributed to the troops, everyone scrambled to read them. Those who were illiterate asked others to read them for them, and they were willing to take a short break to read the leaflets. Many people held their rice bowls, and some did not sleep in the morning, wanting to read them. Zhang Congshan, a machine gunner in a certain unit, often went to the company headquarters to ask for leaflets to read. Zhou Sanhu put the leaflets in his pocket after reading them, saying, "It will be useful when the time comes." Soldier Yang Gouwa said, "Small leaflets, easy to say, easy to understand, easy to remember, and can be used to solve problems."

The soldiers liked these trench leaflets very much before the battle. In the battle to capture the East Gate of Linfen, Li Hongyin, a new soldier of the 206th Regiment, was hit by the enemy's white phosphorus bomb during the charge. He rolled several times, and there was still a little bit not extinguished, so he quickly took off his clothes and threw them away, and as a result, he was not injured. After the battle, he said as soon as he returned, "The method mentioned in the leaflet is effective. I was hit by a white phosphorus bomb and did as the leaflet said, and I was not injured at all." Several soldiers of the Second Company were still chanting, "We are steel nails," while breaking into the deep trenches.

The soldiers liked and cherished these trench leaflets because they introduced their own experiences and told them the methods, closely combining battlefield training and ideological mobilization, helping them improve tactics and techniques. In form, the leaflets were all in the form of rhythmic storytelling, the sentences were simple and easy to understand, the characters were printed large and clear, and there were no simplified characters. Some even had cartoons. These trench leaflets could combine military, cultural learning, and entertainment, so they were most welcomed by the soldiers and comrades, and thus became the most effective way and tool of trench political work.

　　攻克临汾战役中的
  　战壕小传单
    临汾前线的人民解放军，在长期的战壕生活和战斗中，创造了一种对部队教育鼓动作用最大的战壕小传单。部队进入战壕后，由于成天都分散在阵地上和战壕中的避弹坑内，原来的各种学习、文化娱乐方式都不便进行，部队觉得生活单调枯燥，有些部队就在战壕里布置了俱乐部，出了门板报。但是俱乐部显得太拥挤了，不合乎分散隐蔽的要求，于是在士兵群众中发展了许多小型的文化娱乐活动，其中以快板流行最广，甚至他们习惯于把一切的生活学习和战斗经验都用这种形式表达出来。同时，敌人为了垂死挣扎，竟对我军施放毒气弹和投掷黄麻磷弹等不常见的武器，部队急须讲求对付的方法，领导上便利用了这种形式来进行教育，并发动部队想办法。“郑州”部队首先利用这种形式，进行了三弹“照明弹、黄磷弹、毒气弹”教育。他们的办法是发动部队讨论三弹的性能，和我们对付的办法，然后综合起来，把它写成简单通俗的小传单，分发到各个战壕里去。这种传单发到部队后，干部战士都很欢迎，帮助他们马上解除了对三弹的思想顾虑。战士卫学广说：“看了传单后，知道照明弹不伤人，还可辨明地形，我一点也不害怕了。”关于照明弹的传单是：“照明弹，没啥用，外面是个洋铁桶，不爆炸，不伤人，专为夜间来照明。没落地，不要动，趁着明亮看地形；等它熄灭了，赶快就前进。”防毒传单提出了关于防毒的各种办法：“阵地上准备石灰水，肥皂手巾带身边，发现敌人放毒气，手巾纵横垒六遍，或是湿上石灰水，用肥皂水更保险；湿好蒙住口和鼻，毒气不能往里钻；石灰肥皂不方便，手巾洗尿也能行，要是一时来不及，就用湿土来蒙严，麦苗绿草都能用，扭扭堵在口鼻间；要是能往高地跑，跑上高地也保险；要是时间来得及，可用炸弹炸药来打散；湿土也能埋住它，泼水也能把它淹，破鞋烂袜蒙住嘴，办法简单又方便。咱们有的是办法，敌人放毒也枉然。”战士李士华看了防毒传单后说：“敌人放毒气弹也扯球蛋，咱们有的是对付的办法。”
    经过三弹教育后，领导上发现战壕传单是在战壕中进行政治工作最有效的一种方式，便根据部队当前的中心工作和战士们想出的各种作战办法，有意识的有计划的制发，一时在各个部队里就流行起来了。
    当部队要采取坑道爆破去摧毁敌人的堡垒时，制发了两种战壕传单，一种写道：“咱们有飞机，光叫敌人坐，不在天上飞，钻在地底下；步兵象跑道，工兵把机驾，敌人一坐上，全都美死啦。”另一种写道：“敌人害咱飞机怕，总想逃避不坐它，钻在地上用缸听，又用武兵出来打。咱们这里一伙子，装造飞机老行家，汗流湿土不怕苦，根据情况想办法，精确计算没偏差，细心大胆往里挖，飞机给他装造好，敌人不坐不由他。”部队看到这两种传单后，大家对坑道的信心提高了，坑道作业的情绪格外高涨了。
    根据攻坚战斗的特点和打外围据点的经验，须要加强小群动作，因此班长的指挥是一个非常重要的问题，便召集过去指挥好，战功大的几个班长，座谈班长的指挥问题。根据讨论结果，写成传单，又拿到连队里征求一些班长和战士的意见，经修改后，再把它印成传单。发下去后，班长同志如获至宝，排长也争着要看。一个副排长朱清云说：“这解决了我的指挥位置问题，对我帮助很大，希望以后多印一些。”友邻部队接到后，也马上翻印散发。
    总攻临汾东关前，为了改善突击队和纵深战斗部队的战术动作，便又写了“钢钉和钢锥”、“怎样打纵深”两种传单，前一种短促有力地写道：“突击队象钢钉，钉在突破口，赛过泰山稳；突击队象锥尖，插进敌心脏，一直往里钻，进一步钉个钉，没有后退只前进。扎一锥，闻着腥，见肉美美吃一顿。”
    “怎样打纵深”这张传单的头两节是：“（一）纵深战斗要大胆，猛打猛冲往里钻，快把敌人打混乱，不让龟孙把气喘，敌我混成一圪＠，指挥更要有办法，心要细胆要大，多用计谋诈唬他，还要不打哑巴仗，喊话能顶机关枪，敌人昏头转了向，人多也得把俘虏当。（二）打纵深，要疏散，不要挤成一圪＠，碰上敌人少，干脆吃掉他；碰上敌人多，顶牛不中用，侧翼去迂回。正面火力攻，钳子一圪挟，看他有啥种，想跑跑不了，任凭我摆弄。”
    某部有营教导员侯进同志说：“看了‘怎样打纵深’这张传单，解决了我在纵深发展中一个顶牛问题。”
    传单一发到部队，大家抢着看，不识字的要求别人给他念，宁愿小休息一会，也要看看传单。许多人端着饭碗，有的上午不睡觉，还要去看看。某部机枪连战士张从善常到连部去要传单看，周三虎把传单看罢后，就装进了口袋里，说：“到时候好用它”。战士杨狗娃说：“小传单，又顺嘴，又好懂，容易记，还能用，就是解决问题。”
    对这种战壕传单，战士们在战斗前很喜欢。在攻占临汾东关的战斗中，二○六部队新战士李红银同志在冲锋时，中了敌人的黄磷弹，他就连打了几个滚，还有一点没有熄，他就急忙把衣服脱下摔了，结果没有受伤。战斗结束后，他一回来就说：“传单上说的办法就是灵，我中了黄磷弹，照着传单上的办法做了，一点也没有受伤。”二连几个战士在突进纵深壕里，还在不断地念着：“我们是钢钉”。
    战士们之所以喜欢和爱护这种战壕传单，是因为这种传单介绍了他们自己的经验，又告诉了他们办法，与战场练兵、思想发动密切结合，它帮助他们提高战术和技术。在形式上，传单全是采用快板形式，句子写得简单通俗，字印得又大又显，并且没有简笔字，有的更配有漫画。这种战壕传单，且能使军事、文化学习和娱乐结合起来，因此它就受到广大士兵同志最大的欢迎，因此也就成了战壕政治工作最有效的一种方式和工具。（车敏）
