[Taihang News] Party members and cadres in various villages of Neiqiu County, responding to the call issued by the county Party committee in early June for "a concentrated effort in wheat harvesting and early sowing," completed all wheat harvesting and sowing within eleven days, and the spring seedlings on the sown land have already begun their second weeding. This year, there were more wheat fields. Before the wheat harvest began, each village rectified its mutual aid teams and set appropriate wages (generally, a full laborer received five jin of wheat per day with meals, or eight jin without meals, and livestock received fifteen jin per day). They also determined the seeds for sowing in conjunction with the wheat harvest. The county's 200,000 mu of wheat fields were roughly harvested in five days. After a thorough rain on the first day of the fifth lunar month, most villages convened expanded production committees that evening, setting specific steps and division of labor methods, combining threshing with a concentrated effort in sowing. Within five or six days, all 200,000 mu of wheat stubble land had been sown (a small portion was reserved for vegetable gardens).

There are several reasons why this wheat harvesting and sowing was completed so quickly: (1) Cadres and Party members, after short training sessions and various meetings, were in high spirits. Cadres who had made mistakes in the past also expressed their determination to make amends through production. Many responsible cadres participated in the production committees, strengthening production leadership. The cadres in this village, after short training sessions, automatically reflected on their shortcomings to the villagers and actively led production, playing a leading role. After the heavy rain, the cadres of Xiyang Village immediately went to help the masses transport manure (the ground was too wet to use baskets). The village chief took the lead in rushing to sow for the team members first. The farmers' association used its own livestock to sow for military families first. (2) Preparatory work was done well before the wheat harvest and sowing. In order to sow earlier, in Nan'jie, the boundaries of the paddy fields were connected as soon as the wheat was cut. If it didn't rain, they would "water" sow; if it rained, they would rush to sow. This made it easier for the rain to penetrate and the land to be evenly distributed. The village chief finished cutting wheat in the morning and connected the boundaries of 17 mu of land in the afternoon. The branch secretary hauled several loads of wheat in half a day and connected the boundaries of several mu of land. The villagers of Xitang Village hauled manure to the fields while pulling wheat. Many villages in the fifth and sixth districts hauled manure to the fields before cutting wheat and immediately spread it as soon as the wheat was cut. (3) The organization was good. As soon as the wheat harvest ended, the people and masses who were busy with the wheat harvest shifted their enthusiasm to sowing. If there were not enough livestock, people were organized to pull carts and plows. As soon as it rained, Li Yang Village in the first district discussed the division of labor and proposed that idle people should not idle the drills. Yang Mengde had eight full laborers, three half-laborers, two livestock, and three drills, and planned to sow more than 100 mu of autumn land in three days. Two livestock pulled two drills, and six laborers were organized to pull one drill. The two drills pulled by livestock sowed 18 mu in half a day. The one pulled by people sowed 12 mu in half a day (including sowing and rolling), and as a result, it was completed in less than three days. After the rain, Jin Dianzhai immediately transformed the wheat harvesting team into a sowing team and launched a competition with Jin Dian Nan Guan. Two hundred and fifty-one male laborers, fifty-two female laborers, eighty-one livestock, twenty-four drills, and sixty-seven wheat all entered the sowing process. Men sowed, women helped with the drills (leading livestock), men connected the boundaries, and women dotted the seeds, with half a laborer pulling the spindle. Every night, the cadres and team leaders held a meeting to solve problems, praise models, and complete 394 mu of land in one day, including connecting and sowing. Si Li Tun had few livestock, so men and women were mobilized to pull drills, freeing up livestock to harrow the land. The wages for people and livestock were mostly discussed by the masses and were slightly lower than during the wheat harvest. Accounts were settled immediately after sowing. (4) Problems discovered during sowing were resolved in a timely manner. Some people had difficulties with seeds, and adjustments were made early through exchange methods. Ma Zhuang in the first district exchanged four bags of beans and millet seeds for the masses. In addition to lending fruit peel beans to the masses, the head of the Feng Village cooperative took out a bag of black beans from his own home to exchange for the masses. Most of the elderly and widowed households without labor were absorbed into mutual aid teams and mostly planted. Now the seedlings are growing very well, and the second weeding has begun.

　　党员干部带头科学组织分工
  　内邱完成麦收下种
    【太行讯】内邱各村党员干部与广大农民响应六月初县委发出的“突击麦收，提早下种”的号召，于十一天内全部完成麦收、下种地春苗已开始锄二遍。今年麦田较多，在麦收开始前，各村即分别整顿了互助，订了适当工资（一般整劳力管饭一天麦子五斤，不管饭八斤，牲口一天十五斤），订出麦收结合下种的种子。全县二十万亩麦田，五天即大体收完。阴历五月初一下了透雨，大体村庄当晚就召开了扩大生产委员会，订出具体步骤与分工办法，结合打场，突击下种。五、六天内，二十万亩麦茬地已全部种完（有一小部分留作菜地）。
    这次麦收下种迅速完成的原因有几个：（一）干部党员经过短训与各种会议，情绪高涨，过去犯错误的干部，也表示要在生产中立功补过。许多负责干部参加了生产委员会，加强了生产领导。此村的干部短训后自动向村民反省，积极领导生产，起了带头作用。西阳村干部在透雨后马上去给群众往来抬粪（地湿不能用框子）。村长带头先给组员抢种。农会宣传用自己牲口先给军属种。（二）麦收下种前做好了准备工作。南街为了提早下种，水地的畦界一割麦就串起了，不下雨就“水”种，下了雨就抢种。这样雨易下透，垧也调匀。村长上午割完麦，下午就串了十七亩地的畦。支书半天拉了几趟麦，又串了亩地畦界。西汤村拉麦子就把粪捎到地里，五、六区不少村在割麦前即将粪拉到地头，一割麦马上就撒粪。（三）组织的好。麦收一结束，各区村抓紧麦收的人们与群众起热劲，马上转向下种。牲口不够用的，就组织人拉车、犁。一区李阳村一下雨就讨论了分工办法，提出闲人不闲耧。杨梦德有八个全劳力，三个半劳力，两头牲口三张耧，一百多亩秋地，计划三天种完。两个牲口拉两张耧，共组织六个劳力拉一张耧。牲口拉的两张半天种了十八亩。人拉的一张半天种了十二亩（连着带种带砘），结果不到三天就种完了。金店寨在下雨后，马上将麦收小队变为下种小队，和金店南关开展竞赛，二百五十一个男劳力，五十二个女劳力，八十一头牲口，二十四张耧，六十七张麦子全部进入下种。男种女帮耧（牵牲口），男串女点种，半个劳力拉纯子。每晚间开干部组长接头会，有问题就解决，有模范就表扬，一天连串带种完成三百九十四亩。四里屯牲口少，男女动员起来人拉耧，誊出牲口光管耢耙地。人畜工资，大部都经过群众讨论，比收麦时减低一些，种完后马上算帐。（四）下种中发现问题及时解决。有些人种子困难，及早用兑换办法进行了调剂。一区马壮换给群众豆子谷种四布袋。冯村合作社长除将果皮豆借给群众外，又从自己家拿出一袋黑豆换给群众。孤老无劳力户，大部吸收入互助组，大部种上了。现在苗都长的很好，青苗已开始锄二遍。（内邱联合办公室）
