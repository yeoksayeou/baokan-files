　　Political Department of the Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei
  　Releases the Secretary-General of the Ba County Kuomintang
    [News from Central Hebei] The Political Department of the Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei released over two hundred people last month, including Wang Wending, the Secretary-General of the Ba County Kuomintang, who were captured in the battles of Daqinghebei and Shengfang. Wang Wending had served as a standing committee member of the Ba County Kuomintang, a member of the Tianjin Kuomintang Reorganization Committee, and a liaison officer of the North China Kuomintang Party Affairs Office; he served as the Secretary-General of the Ba County Kuomintang in 1943. He was captured in the Tang'erli battle last April. After more than a year of influence and education from the military and civilians of the Liberated Area, Wang has become quite aware. Before leaving, he stated: "Given my crimes, I never expected this day to come. The democratic government has given me a new life. From now on, I am determined to be a citizen of the Liberated Area. I was wrong about the past.” Sun Zhetian, the deputy chief of the pseudo-big township captured in the Rongcheng Zaoma battle, said with emotion after being released: "The People's Liberation Army is truly generous; they even released someone like me." After the Chiang soldiers captured in the Songliukou battle were released, desertions from Jiang Zihua's pseudo-forces in western Tianjin greatly increased. A machine gunner said: "Jiang Zihua deceived me; he said that if you were caught by the People's Liberation Army, you would be killed, but now they have all been released."
