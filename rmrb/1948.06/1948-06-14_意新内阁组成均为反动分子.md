Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. (Delayed dispatch) Rome News: Gasperi's new reactionary cabinet was put on stage on the 24th. The new cabinet includes 11 seats for the Christian Democratic Party, 3 seats for the right-wing Socialist Party, along with 3 seats for the Liberal Party, and a total of 20 seats for the Republican Party and so-called non-party representatives. The members of the new cabinet are all Italian reactionaries, and its basic figures are still members of the previous cabinet. In addition to Gasperi himself serving as Prime Minister and Minister of Italian Africa, in order to ease the contradictions between the reactionary factions in their struggle for power and profit, Gasperi blatantly violated the new constitution and arbitrarily added three Deputy Prime Minister positions, with the Christian Democratic Party occupying one seat, and the Liberal Party and the right-wing Socialist Party each taking one seat. Furthermore, according to the orders of the U.S. State Department, the important traitorous position of implementing the Marshall Plan in the cabinet was given to a right-wing socialist. The struggle for the position of the Italian executor of the Marshall Plan had delayed Gasperi's cabinet formation activities for as long as a month. It was only after the Italian Ambassador to the United States, Tarchiani, returned to the country and conveyed the "wishes" of the U.S. State Department to Gasperi on the 20th that Gasperi had no choice but to cede the above position to a Saragat follower.

　　意新内阁组成均为反动分子
    【新华社陕北三十日电】（迟到）罗马消息：加斯贝利新的反动内阁，已于二十四日纷墨登场。新阁包括基督教民主党十一席，右翼社会党三席，连同自由党三席，共和党及所谓无党派的代表共廿席。新阁成员均为意大利反动分子，其基本人物仍为上届内阁阁员，除加斯贝利自任总理兼意属非洲部部长外，为缓和反动派之间争权夺利的矛盾，加斯贝利不惜公然违犯新宪法擅自添设副总理三席，除基督教民主党自占一席外，并给了自由党、右翼社会党各一席。并根据美国国务院的命令，将内阁中执行马歇尔计划的重要卖国职位给予右翼社会党人。按争夺马歇尔计划之意大利执行人这一职位的斗争，曾使加斯贝利的组阁活动尽延一月之久，只是由于意大利驻美大使塔其阿尼返国，并于二十日向加斯贝利传达了美国国务院的“愿望”之后，加斯贝利才不得不将上项职位让予萨拉盖特党徒。
