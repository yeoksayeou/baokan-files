　　The deviation correction work in Su Cao and other villages has not yet started.
  　The Handan County Party Committee turns a blind eye.
  　Great impact on production.
    Continued infringement of the interests of middle peasants; compensation to "wait until after wheat harvest"
    Extreme chaos in new and old organizations; "Release, but can't let go; manage, but can't control!"
    [Report from our newspaper] Recently, reporters from the General Branch visited Su Cao and other villages in Handan County and found that the deviation correction work in this area has not yet begun, the organization is abnormally chaotic, and the county party committee leaders are turning a blind eye to many serious problems or paying little attention to them. The following is a report based on what we heard and saw:
    First, the wrongly struggled middle peasants have not been compensated to this day, and they are still continuing to harm the interests of the middle peasants. Even recently, middle peasants were excluded from production loans. According to the village cadres in Su Cao and Liu Erzhuang: Su Cao definitely wrongly struggled twelve middle-peasant households and two poor-peasant households. In Liu Erzhuang, at least twelve middle-peasant households were wrongly struggled among the thirty-five households struggled in the whole village. The reporter investigated two of the struggled households in Su Cao. One was Li Yangzhai, who had only five mu of land in the year of the incident and eight family members, relying on doing business to support his family. After the Japanese occupation, the business collapsed, and he went home to redeem a few mu of mortgaged land. At the time of the struggle, he had nineteen mu of land, a courtyard, a mule, and a donkey, and had never hired a long-term worker. After the struggle, he was swept out of his house, without leaving a mu of land. Li ekes out a living by selling peanuts and melon seeds, while his son goes out to drive a cart, and his grandchildren beg on the streets. Another one is called Li Yangzhen, with eleven family members and twenty-five mu of land. He hired a small long-term worker for one year when the war of resistance against Japan began. After the struggle, only eight mu of land remained. According to Comrade Bai, a staff member of the village, there are many similar situations among the fifty-odd households that were struggled, because they are afraid of compensating rich peasants as wealthy middle peasants, so they dare not confirm them as middle peasants. The county decided to compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants one or two weeks before the wheat harvest, but no compensation has been made so far. Su Cao only did registration and investigation without compensation. The reason is that some specific difficulties were encountered in the work, such as from what time should the wrong struggle be calculated? How to deal with things that the masses have already distributed? What things must be compensated? When these were raised to the county, the county party committee did not have any specific solutions, only saying to wait until after the wheat harvest. However, on the other hand, they are rushing to distribute the fruits, creating a situation where "white cloth cannot be returned from a dyeing shop." At the same time, some places are still infringing on the interests of middle peasants. In Nansu Cao, the mule of a carpenter named Han was struggled last year. This spring, poor peasants took turns feeding and using it, but everyone only used it without feeding it, so that it became too thin to stand up. Village cadres saw in the newspaper that they were told to return livestock to middle peasants, so they returned the mule to Han; however, as soon as the livestock was fattened, the poor peasant association took the mule away again. There is also the exclusion of middle peasants in production loans. According to the cadres of the Second District, the first loan arrangement said: only lend to poor peasants and hired peasants, not to middle peasants, and whoever lends wrongly will be held responsible. After the inspection, there were no middle peasants in the loan households in the entire district. The second loan said that middle peasants can borrow, but the number of households and the amount of money loaned were very small. In Su Cao's loan, the poor peasants decided who could borrow, and only those who were decided by the poor peasants could borrow. The meeting to decide on the loan did not even allow the newly elected middle-peasant village head to participate. The new village head said that his task in the loan was only to follow the rules, "The poor peasants have decided, so I will follow the rules. Because the bank's loan procedures have a 'village head's stamp' item." The reporter asked him why he was not allowed to participate, and he said: "I am a middle peasant." This kind of exclusion of middle peasants directly affects and strikes at the production enthusiasm of the middle peasants.
    Most landlords and rich peasants are not resettled; some without land are begging for food
    Secondly, a large number of landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes have not yet been resettled. Among the fifty-odd households that were struggled in Su Cao, nine households, with fifty-three people, have no land. Two days before the wheat harvest, some people were still begging for food (now it is the wheat harvest, and they rely on picking up wheat to make a living). Among the thirty-five households struggled in Liu Erzhuang, seven households, with fifty-one people, have no land. The remaining struggled households have an average of only 1.74 mu of land per person (weak). (The county party committee working group found more than 80 mu of wasteland here, and under the view that wasteland should not be allowed to exist, they gave some land to the landless households.) The reporter asked a responsible comrade of the county about the situation of begging and landlessness among the struggled households in Su Cao. The comrade said: "The entire struggled landlords, rich peasants, and those not confirmed as middle peasants will be resolved by supplementing them in the autumn. I don't know about the begging situation in this village yet." On the other hand, there are still phenomena of arbitrarily confiscating and using the labor of people who cannot live without compensation. There is a man named Jin Zangshu in Su Cao. After the struggle, the man fled, and there are only women and children in the family. They were still constantly begging for food before the wheat harvest. After his family was struggled, there were still some bricks left, and he wanted to sell them for food. The Public Security Bureau heard about it and asked the peasant association to buy them at a price of 25 yuan per brick (it is said that the market price is 30 to 40 yuan), buying 3,200 bricks at once. The money was handed over to the peasant association, which invisibly constituted another confiscation of Jin's family. Before the village cadres of Beibao came to the county for training, they said that it was difficult to harvest wheat and hoe the fields and were unwilling to come. The district cadres said: "Go! I guarantee that the land will not be barren. Call the struggled households to hoe the fields and harvest the wheat for you." A comrade from the Public Security Bureau said that similar facts are quite common in various villages.
    Again: the organization is chaotic, the cadres are panic-stricken, and until recently – the end of May – there was even a militiaman who hanged himself. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, Handan generally had poor peasant organizations. According to a responsible comrade of the county, the poor peasant organizations came from three sources: first, the poor peasant and hired peasant groups during last year's review, which, after the promulgation of the Land Law, were transformed into the highest power organs in the villages; second, some opponents of the old village cadres after the promulgation of the Land Law automatically formed poor peasant associations; and third, some poor peasant and hired peasant production committees were established during this spring's production loans. Now these poor peasant organizations from different sources are all influencing everything in the village. According to the cadres of the Second District: even those spontaneous organizations, some we knew about beforehand, and some we recognized as legal afterwards. After the district cadres publicized the power of the poor peasants, the militiamen in the Shaxi sub-district handed over their guns to the poor peasant association. Su Cao, where the county party committee is located, organized a production committee (according to talk, this is the highest power organ in the village), and without announcing the dismissal of the old village cadres, it elected a new village head and new cadres. At the same time as the rise of the new organization, the old cadres and old organizations generally collapsed, saying "killing the donkey after it has finished grinding," "cutting chives," "our generation is no good, let's change it!" The panic of the old cadres lasted until May 28th and 29th, and a militiaman hanged himself in Lizhuang, Second District. In the recent wheat harvest, the phenomenon of grabbing wheat from the homes of village cadres who were receiving training in the county occurred in Jiabao, Fifth District, and some areas in the Second District. In Nansu Cao, First District, the new village cadres led the harvesting of four mu of wheat from the old village cadre Qin Xinglong and forcibly exchanged Hao Shangzeng's good wheat for bad wheat land. At the same time, a party member from the Second District came to the county party committee and said: "I dare not hoe my seedlings anymore. I don't know when people will take them away? I don't know who will harvest them in the future!" At this time, the leadership felt that it was wrong to kick away the old organization, but did not dare to abandon the new organization, forming a difficult situation of "releasing, but unable to release; managing, but unable to manage." After the erroneous policy of completely kicking away the old village cadres, the county concentrated and trained all the old village cadres in late May. According to the county secretary, this training solved the problems of two-thirds of the villages. However, a cadre from the First District who had just returned from below said that this estimate seems too high. He said that after the old village cadres returned to their districts, the situation in many villages was more chaotic than before. The militia captain of Zhongbao said after returning: "All poor peasant associations must be cancelled without approval"; and said that the new village cadres were corrupt and wanted to settle accounts. The new village cadres said: "It's okay to settle accounts, but the accounts of the fruits of the struggle of your old village cadres for several years have not been settled, so let's settle them all together!" The new and old village cadres argued endlessly, resulting in a stalemate. Some other old village cadres said that they were promoted for certain reasons during the training, saying: "Use them when needed, and put them behind when not needed." The new village cadres said: "The Feixiang meeting said to let us poor peasants and hired peasants be the masters of the house, but now it's not allowed again. Nothing that is said counts."
    While discussing these chaotic situations with a responsible comrade of the county, the reporter inquired whether the "mass voices" about Handan published in this newspaper were completely true? The comrade said: "I still don't know what the problem is." About a militiaman hanging himself and the grabbing of wheat from village cadres in the Second District, he said that there was such a thing, but he did not know the name of the village, the name of the person, and the date, saying that he had sent someone to "investigate." Regarding the fact that the deviation correction work in Handan has not started, is it a problem of being left or right? The comrade believes: "I'm afraid being not thorough is the main thing." But how many villages are not thorough? In what aspects is it manifested? The comrade did not give a specific answer. The reporter only studied the materials of Liu Erzhuang, a village that the county party committee considered not thorough. It is said that this village "was a model village during the war of resistance against Japan and a backward village during the land reform." The whole village has 271 households, and 35 families were struggled, accounting for 12.9% of the total number of households in the village. Among them, 7 households, with 51 people, have no land (now they all have a little bit of stubble land). The total land of the 35 households is 387.5 mu, averaging 1.74 mu per person (weak), which is lower than the village's average of one mu. Only some military families and revolutionary martyrs retain a small amount of well land (averaging more than 0.4 mu) and waterwheels, livestock, etc.; the houses were also mostly struggled, but some have not moved out; judging from the land and houses, they are not getting their due share. It is said that being politically not thorough is: two of the three teachers are struggled households; two of the three warehouse staff are also struggled households; one of the three river management committee members is a struggled household; two of the party members are struggled households (already cleaned up during last year's review). However, the comrades working in the village have already confirmed that at least 12 middle-peasant households were wrongly struggled.

　　苏曹等村尚未纠偏
  　邯郸县委熟视无睹
  　对生产影响颇大
    继续侵犯中农利益　补偿要“等麦后再说”
    新旧组织极端混乱　“放又放不下，管又管不了！”
    【本报消息】日前总分社记者走访邯郸县苏曹等村，发现该地纠偏工作尚未开始，组织异常混乱，县委领导对许多严重的问题熟视无睹或很少注意，现就耳闻目睹分别报导于下：
    首先是错斗中农至今未补偿，且仍在继续损害中农利益，直到最近生产贷款中还排斥中农。据苏曹与刘二庄的坐村干部谈：苏曹肯定错斗了的中农十二户，贫农二户；刘二庄在全村三十五家被斗户中，至少错斗中农十二户。记者在苏曹的被斗户中调查了两户，其中有一李扬斋，事变那年只有五亩地，八口人，靠做生意养家；日寇占后生意倒塌，回家赎回几亩当契地。斗争时有地十九亩，一处庄，一个骡子，一个驴，从来没雇过长工；斗后扫地出门，没留一亩地；李以卖花生瓜子糊口，其子则外出赶车，孙子们讨吃街头。另一个叫李仰祯，十一口人，二十五亩地，抗战开始那年雇过一年小长工，被斗后只剩八亩地。据该村工作人员白同志谈，五十多家被斗户中，类似情况还不少，因为怕把富农当富裕中农补偿了，所以不敢肯定为中农。该县补偿错斗中农，在麦收前一二十天就作了决定，但至今无一补偿，苏曹只做了登记调查，没有补偿，其原因是工作中碰到一些具体困难，比如错斗从什么时候算起？群众已分了的东西怎样办？哪些东西必须赔等，向县提出后，县委也没有具体办法，只说等麦后再说。可是另方面他们又急急忙忙的分果实，来一个“染房里不能退白布”的局面；同时有些地方还在侵犯中农利益。南苏曹去年斗了韩木匠的骡子，今春贫农轮流喂，轮流使，但大家光使不喂，以致瘦得站不起来；村干看到报上叫退还中农牲口，便将骡子退给韩某；然而牲口刚刚喂肥，贫农团就又把骡子牵走了。还有生产贷款中排斥中农。据二区干部谈：第一次贷款布置说：光贷给贫雇，不贷给中农，谁贷错谁负责，事后检查，全区贷款户里无一中农。第二次贷款说中农可以贷，但贷款的户与款都很少。苏曹贷款是，贫农决定谁贷，谁才能贷。决定贷款的会议，连新选举的中农村长都不让参加，新村长说他在贷款中的任务是只管按章，“贫农决定了，咱就按个章。因为人家银行贷款手续上有‘村长章’一项。”记者问他为啥不叫参加，他说：“咱是中农。”这种排斥中农的现象，直接影响和打击着中农的生产情绪。
    地富大部未安置　无地要饭的都有
    其次，扫地出门的地富，仍有大批未安置。苏曹五十多家被斗户中，九户，五十三个人无地，麦收的前两天还有人要饭（现正麦收，靠拾麦糊口）。刘二庄三十五家被斗户中，七户，五十一个人无地，其余被斗户每人平均只有一亩七分四（弱）的地。（县委工作组在此，发现有八十多亩荒地，在不让有荒地的观点下，才给了无地户些地。）记者曾以苏曹被斗户讨饭与无地的情况询问该县某负责同志，该同志说：“整个被斗地富，和不肯定为中农者，等秋后抽补中解决。这村要饭的情况我还不了解。”而另方面，对无法生活的人们仍有随便没收及无代价使用其劳动的现象。苏曹有一金藏书，斗后男人外逃，家中只有妇女小孩，麦前还不断要饭，他家被斗后还剩些砖，想卖了换些吃食，公安局闻讯，便找农会去买，以每砖二十五元的价格（据说市价三十元到四十元），一下买了三千二。钱交了农会，无形中又对金家来了一次没收。北堡村干来县受训前，提出割麦锄地困难，不愿来，区干就说：“去吧！保证不能荒了地，叫被斗户给你锄地、割麦。”公安局一同志谈，类似事实，各村还很不少。
    再次：组织混乱，干部恐慌，直到最近——五月底——还有一民兵上吊。土地法大纲公布后，邯郸普遍有了贫农组织。据该县负责同志谈，贫农组织是由三方面而来：一是去年复查时的贫雇小组，在土地法公布后，便一转而为村中的最高权力机关；二是土地法公布后一些旧村干的反对派，自动组成贫农团；三是今春生产贷款，成立了一些贫雇生产委员会。现在这些不同来源的贫农组织，均在左右着村子的一切。据二区干部谈：就是那些自发组织，有的事前我们知道，有的事后承认了其合法。区干宣传贫农权力后，沙西小区的民兵，把枪都交了贫农团，县委所在地的苏曹，组织了生产委员会（据谈这是村里的最高权力机关），而且没有宣布旧村干撤职，就选举了新村长、新干部。于新组织兴起的同时，老干部旧组织普遍躺倒，说什么“卸磨杀驴”，“割韭菜”，“咱这一茬不行了，换吧！”老干部的恐慌直到五月二十八、九日，二区李庄还有民兵上吊。近几天麦收中五区贾堡及二区某些在县受训的村干，均发生家里麦子被哄的现象，就在一区南苏曹，新村干领导割了老村干秦兴隆的四亩麦子，并拿坏麦地强换郝尚增的好麦子。与此同时，二区一党员来找县委说：“我的青苗地不敢再锄了，不知哪会叫人家弄走？也不知将来谁收哩！”这时领导上感到了踢开老组织的不对，但不敢抛开新组织，形成为“放、又放不下；管、又管不了”的苦境，在完全踢开老村干的错误政策后，该县于五月下旬，集训了所有的老村干，据县书谈：此次集训，使三分之二的村子解决了问题。但新从下边回来的一区干部谈：这种估计似乎过高，他说他区老村干回去后，不少村子的情况比前更混乱了。中堡民兵队长回去说：“贫农团没经过批准，一律取消”；并说新村干有贪污，要算帐。新村干说：“要算帐也好，你们老村干几年的斗争果实帐未算，咱就一齐算算吧！”新老村干争执不下，致成僵局。另一些老村干，说集训是因了某些原因，才把他们提起来，说：“用着了靠前，用不着了靠后。”而新村干则说：“肥乡会议说叫咱贫雇当家，这又不叫了，说啥不算啥。”
    在和该县某负责同志研究这些混乱情况中，记者曾询及本报所载有关邯郸的“群众呼声”是否完全真实？该同志说：“我还不知道是什么问题。”一民兵上吊，二区哄了村干部的麦子，他说有这末回事，但不知道村名、人名与时日，说是已派人“调查去了。”对邯郸纠偏工作未开始，究竟是左还是右的问题。该同志认为：“恐怕不彻底是主要的。”而不彻底的村子究竟有多少？表现在哪方面？该同志未作具体回答。记者仅就县委认为不彻底的一个村——刘二庄的材料做了研究，据说这村“在抗日时期为模范村，土地改革时期为落后村。”全村有二百七十一户，被斗三十五家，占全村户数的百分之十二点九，其中有七户，五十一人无地（现都多少有了点茬地），三十五户中所有的土地是三百八十七亩五分，每人平均一亩七分四（弱），低于全村平均数的一亩。其中只有部分军工烈属保有少量井地（平均四分多）和水车、牲口等；房子也多被斗，只是有的没搬出；从土地房子上看，他们还不足应得的一份。据说在政治上不彻底是：三个教员中有两个被斗户；三个仓库人员中，亦有两个被斗户；三个治河委员中，有一个被斗户；党员中两个被斗户（去年复查时已清洗）。但就该村工作同志已经肯定错斗了的中农，至少有十二户。
