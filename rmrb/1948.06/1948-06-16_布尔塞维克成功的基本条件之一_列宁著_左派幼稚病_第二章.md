Indeed, almost everyone can now see that if we Bolsheviks had not upheld the strictest and truly iron discipline in our party, and if our party had not enjoyed the fullest and most heartfelt support of the entire working class, that is, the fullest and most heartfelt support of all the thinking, upright, self-sacrificing, influential people in the working class who are capable of leading or attracting the backward masses, then the Bolshevik Party could not have maintained power, not even for two and a half months, let alone two and a half years.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the most desperate and ruthless war waged by the new class against a more powerful enemy, the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's resistance is intensified tenfold because it has been overthrown (even in one country). Its strength lies not only in the power of international capital, not only in the strength of the bourgeoisie's international connections, but also in the force of habit and the force of small production. Because small production remains in the world, and unfortunately there is still a lot of it, and small production daily, hourly, constantly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale generates capitalism and the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary; it is impossible to defeat the bourgeoisie without a long, tenacious, fierce, life-and-death war, a war that requires perseverance, discipline, firmness, unwaveringness, and unity of will.

I repeat, the experience of the victorious dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia clearly tells those who will not or have not thought about this issue: the unconditional centralization and strictest discipline of the proletariat are one of the basic conditions for defeating the bourgeoisie.

People often talk about this issue. But what this really means and under what conditions this is possible are rarely considered. Besides cheering and congratulating the Soviet regime and the Bolsheviks, shouldn't we often analyze very solemnly the reasons why the Bolshevik Party was able to cultivate the discipline necessary for the revolutionary proletariat?

Bolshevism began as a political ideological faction and a political party in 1903. Only the history of Bolshevism's entire existence can fully explain how Bolshevism was able to cultivate and maintain the iron discipline necessary for the victory of the proletariat under the most difficult conditions.

Here, the first question that arises is: What maintains the discipline of the proletarian revolutionary party? What tests it? What consolidates it? First, it is the consciousness of the proletarian vanguard and its loyalty to the revolution, its perseverance, self-sacrifice, and heroism. Second, it is its ability to connect with, approach, and, to a certain extent, merge with the broad masses of workers—primarily the masses of the proletariat, but also the non-proletarian working masses. Third, it is the correctness of the political leadership implemented by this vanguard, the correctness of its political strategy and tactics, and the need to convince the broadest masses of this correctness based on their own experience. Without these conditions, the discipline within a revolutionary party that can truly serve as the party of the advanced class (the advanced class that takes on the task of overthrowing the bourgeoisie and transforming the entire society) cannot be realized. Without these conditions, attempts to enforce discipline will inevitably become empty talk, nonsense, and affectation. But on the other hand, these conditions are not produced all at once. These conditions can only be created through long-term work and arduous experience; correct revolutionary theory can promote the creation of these conditions, but this theory itself is not a dogma, and this theory can only be fully formed when it is closely linked with the practice of a truly mass and truly revolutionary movement.

The reason why Bolshevism was able to cultivate and successfully implement the strictest centralization and iron discipline under extremely difficult conditions between 1917 and 1920 is simply due to many features of Russian history.

On the one hand, Bolshevism arose in 1903 on the most solid foundation of Marxist theory. And the correctness of this revolutionary theory—and only this one—is not only proven by the entire experience of the 19th century worldwide, but especially by the experience of the confusion and wavering, errors and disappointments of Russian revolutionary thought. For about fifty years, from the 1840s to the 1890s, Russian advanced thinkers, under the oppression of the unprecedentedly barbaric and reactionary Tsarist government, sought the correct revolutionary theory as if thirsting for a drink. They explored every "new invention" in Europe and America in this regard with amazing diligence and meticulousness. Russia, in half a century, endured unprecedented pain and sacrifice, displayed unprecedented revolutionary heroism, and used unimaginable energy to engage in dedicated research, learning, experimentation, disappointment, review, and comparison of European experiences. After truly suffering all kinds of hardships, it finally obtained Marxism, the only correct revolutionary theory. Because revolutionaries had to live abroad to escape persecution by the Tsarist government, revolutionary Russia in the second half of the 19th century had a richness of international connections and a familiarity with the forms and theories of revolutionary movements in various countries that no other country in the world could match.

On the other hand, Bolshevism, which arose on this solid theoretical basis, had fifteen years (1903 to 1917) of practical history, which is unparalleled in the world in terms of the richness of its experience. Because in these fifteen years, no country had so much revolutionary experience, and the various forms of revolutionary movement—legal and illegal, peaceful and violent, secret and open, group and mass, parliamentary and terrorist—alternated with each other, and none were so rapid and complex. No country has concentrated such a rich array of forms and methods of struggle, as well as the colors that the struggle brought, in such a short period of time. This struggle was participated in by all classes of modern society, and because of Russia's backwardness and the heavy oppression of the Tsarist government, it matured particularly quickly, particularly urgently, and successfully understood the considerable "new inventions" of European and American political experience.

### 布尔塞维克成功的基本条件之一——列宁著“左派幼稚病”第二章

　　布尔塞维克成功的基本条件之一
    ——列宁著“左派幼稚病”第二章
    的确，现在差不多任何人都已经看见，如果我们布尔塞维克党内没有极严格的真正铁的纪律，如果我们党没有得到全体工人阶级群众最充分的和全心全意的拥护，即是说，如果没有得到工人阶级中一切有思想的、正派的、自我牺牲的、有影响的、能够领导或吸引落后群众的人们的最充分的和全心全意的拥护，那末，布尔塞维克党，莫说两年半，便是两月半，也不能维持政权。
    无产阶级专政，乃是新阶级向比较强有力的敌人，向资产阶级所进行的最不顾一切的和最无情的战争；资产阶级的反抗，因为它被人推翻（即使在一个国家内也罢）的缘故而更加强十倍，它的势力不仅在于国际资本的力量，不仅在于资产阶级国际联系的强固，而且还在于习惯的力量与小生产的力量。因为小生产留存在世的，可惜还很多很多，而小生产每日、每时、不断地、自发地、大量地产生资本主义与资产阶级。因此之故，无产阶级专政是必要的；如果不经过长期的、顽强的、激烈的、你死我活的战争，要战胜资产阶级是不可能的，这一战争要求坚忍、纪律、坚定、不屈不挠和意志的统一。
    我重说一遍，俄国得胜的无产阶级专政的经验，明白告诉了那些不会思索或对此问题不曾思索过的人们：无产阶级的无条件的集中制与最严格的纪律，乃是战胜资产阶级的基本条件之一。
    这个问题人们时常讲到。但这到底是什么意思，在什么条件之下这才有可能，人们却很少加以思索。除了向苏维埃政权及布尔塞维克致欢呼祝贺外，难道不应当时常去极其郑重地分析布尔塞维克党之所以能够养成革命无产阶级所必需的纪律之原因吗？
    布尔塞维主义之成为政治思想派别与政党，是从一九○三年开始的。只有布尔塞维主义整个存在时期的历史，才能圆满说明布尔塞维主义何以能够在最困难的条件之下，养成而且保持无产阶级胜利所必需的铁的纪律。
    这里首先发生一个问题，就是无产阶级革命党的纪律是靠什么来维持的？是靠什么来检验的？是靠什么来巩固的？第一，是靠无产阶级先锋队的觉悟及其对于革命的忠心，靠它的坚忍、自我牺牲和英雄气概。第二，是靠它善于同广大劳动群众——首先同无产阶级的群众，同时也同非无产阶级的劳动群众——联系，接近，而且在一定程度上，也可说和他们打成一片。第三，是靠这个先锋队所实现的政治领导的正确，它的政治的战略与策略的正确，而且要使最广大的群众根据自身的经验信服这种正确。如果没有这些条件，那么，真正能够充当先进阶级（以推翻资产阶级和改造整个社会为己任的先进阶级）政党的革命党内部之纪律是不能实现的。如果没有这些条件，那么，整饬纪律的企图，将不免变成空谈、废话、装腔作势。可是另一方面，这些条件并不是一下子就能产生的。这些条件只经过长期工作，艰苦经验，才能造成；正确的革命理论，可以促进这些条件的造成，而这种理论本身也不是教条，这种理论只有与真正群众的和真正革命的运动的实践密切联系起来，才能完全形成。
    布尔塞维主义，在一九一七到一九二○年间异常困难的条件之下，所以能够养成并顺利实现最严格的集中制与铁的纪律，其原因简单地是在于俄国历史上的许多特征。
    一方面，布尔塞维主义于一九○三年是在最坚固的马克思主义理论基础上产生的。而这个——只有这个——革命理论的正确，不但是由整个十九世纪全世界的经验所证明，而且特别是由俄国革命思想界的迷惑和摇摆、错误和失望的经验所证明。大约在十九世纪四十年代到九十年代这五十年内，俄国先进的思想界，在空前野蛮与反动的俄皇政府压迫之下，寻求正确的革命理论，如渴思饮，它用了惊人的奋勉精神与缜密态度探索欧美关于这方面的每一种“新发明”。俄国在半世纪里，受到了空前的痛苦与牺牲，表现了空前的革命英雄气概，用了难以设想的精力，从事了专心致志的探究，学习，实验，失望，审查，对照欧洲经验，真正受尽了千辛万苦之后，才获得了马克思主义这个唯一正确的革命理论。革命者不堪俄皇政府的迫害而不得不侨居国外，所以革命的俄国，在十九世纪后半期，其国际联系之丰富，及其对于各国革命运动的形式与理论之熟悉，为世界任何国家所不及。
    另一方面，在这个坚固的理论基础上所产生出来的布尔塞维主义，有了十五年（一九○三到一九一七年）的实践历史，这段历史，以经验之丰富而论，世界上没有伦比。因为在这十五年内，任何国家都没有这样多的革命经验，革命运动的各种形式——合法的与非法的，和平的与激烈的，秘密的与公开的，小组的与群众的，议会的与恐怖主义的种种形式——彼此交替，都没有这样迅速和复杂。任何一国都没有在这样短促的时期内，集中了这样丰富的斗争的形式、方法以及斗争所带的色彩，这个斗争是现代社会一切阶级都参加在内的，而且这个斗争，因为俄国的落后与俄皇政府的沉重压迫，成熟得特别快，特别急切和成功地领会了欧美政治经验的相当的“新发明”。
