Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. After the political rectification of the Northeast Front Liberation Army units generally came to an end, they have turned to a vigorous military training movement. Considering the increasing importance of attacking battles in the future operations to liberate the entire Northeast, all units are entering a training upsurge with a hundredfold of tension. Leaders of various units have also gone deep into companies to personally grasp leadership and help solve various difficult problems. In the new atmosphere of military democracy that has been set off in all troops, great emphasis is placed on repeated exercises and on-the-spot evaluation in coaching, so as to better combine all learning with the major tasks to come. Before calling for "everyone to learn blasting," the 8th Company of the "Active" unit held a soldiers' meeting to discuss the importance of blasting for attacking battles, and then studied how to blast. After everyone's full study, they carried out on-the-spot exercises, and all the specific actions in the exercises were done very skillfully. At the same time, collective comments and on-the-spot evaluation methods were adopted, so that everyone could quickly master the technology and increase their confidence in attacking. After learning blasting, a certain regiment of the "Will" unit concentrated military cadres above the platoon level into a commando company, with the regiment chief of staff as the company commander, and cadres at the battalion level as deputy company commanders, and cadres at the platoon level as soldiers, and organized branches, political fighters, artillery coordination, communication liaison, rescue, and other coordinated exercises. The division leaders of the unit also personally participated in the guidance, in order to make a typical example and promote the entire army. During the exercise, when launching a general attack on the hypothetical enemy, the entire process of continuous blasting under strong cover, breaking through the front and developing into the depth, until the "core fortification" was taken down and all the defending enemies were wiped out, was demonstrated one by one. Among them, the central items such as how to conduct street fighting and attack "core fortifications" were repeatedly performed three times, and thorough comments were made, so that everyone had a better understanding of the depth combat in attacking. After the exercise, the division leaders of the unit made a conclusion and then assigned cadres at all levels to return to the company to lead the squad soldiers to practice. In the street fighting exercise of the 2nd Company of the "70" unit, all the commanders and fighters of the company were in high spirits, and the liberated soldier You Mingzhong came up with the method of using "living bunkers," using willow branches to make bunker shapes, covering them with felt, and changing their positions at will to form various bunker groups, and then carrying out exercises, vying for each one. From this, some shortcomings in past operations were discovered, and many valuable experiences were gained. When the "Creative" unit's Sanhe group (new, old, and liberated soldiers) was practicing crossing the intersection, some comrades rushed past the corner of the wall in order to be quick. The liberated soldier immediately felt that it was not appropriate, because the enemy in the city specializes in blocking the roots of the walls and corners, and if you are not careful, you will suffer losses. After everyone's research, they came up with many preventive measures. In the attacking exercise of the "Strive" unit, all automatic weapons were gathered, and shooters and cadres who were familiar with their performance were organized to conduct research, and after obtaining methods to master and exert greater power, they were taken to each squad for coaching, with great results. In this training, all units attached great importance to creating and cultivating the "courageous individual" hero movement. Because the heroic and massive emergence of such heroes will play an extremely important role in future battles, some units have already achieved results.

　　准备解放全东北热烈进行大练兵
  　东北我军攻坚战术提高
    反复演习边作边评取得许多宝贵经验
    【新华社东北七日电】东北前线解放军各部政治整训普遍告一段落后，已转入热烈的军事大练兵运动。各部队鉴于今后解放全东北作战中的攻坚战斗日益重要，均以百倍紧张的心情，进入练兵热潮。各部首长亦纷纷深入连队，亲自掌握领导，并帮助解决各种疑难问题。所有部队在已掀起的军事民主的新气氛中，均甚注重教练上的反复演习，与边作边评办法，务求一切学习与行将到来的重大任务更好结合。“活跃”部某团八连在号召“人人学习爆破”以前，召开军人大会，讨论爆破对于攻坚战斗的重要性，然后再研究怎样爆破等问题。经过大家的充分研究后，即进行实地演习，在演习中的各种具体动作，均做得十分纯熟。同时，并采取集体评论，与边做边评办法，使每个人都能很快掌握了技术，提高了攻坚信心。“意志”部某团在学过爆破后，即集中排以上军事干部，编成突击连，由团参谋长作连长，各营干部分别作副连长，排级干部作战士，并组织了支部、政治战士、步炮协同、通讯连络、救护等配合演习。该部师首长也亲自参加指导，以便作出典型，示范推动全军。该部于演习中，对假设敌发动总攻时，从大力掩护下连续爆破，突破前沿向纵深发展，一直到拿下“核心工事”，全歼守敌为止的全盘攻坚过程，逐一表演。其中对怎样进行巷战与攻击“核心工事”等中心项目，则反复作了三遍，并进行了周密的评论，使大家对攻坚中的纵深战斗，有更好的认识。演习后，由该部师首长做出结论，继分配各级干部回到营连去领导班排战士练习。“七○”部二连在演习巷战中，全连指战员情绪高涨，解放战士尤明忠更想出使用“活地堡”的办法，用柳条编成地堡形状，蒙上毡子，随意变动位置，摆成各种地堡群，然后进行演习，逐一争夺，从这中间，并发现了过去作战上的若干缺点，取得了很多宝贵经验。“创造”部某连三合小组（新、老、解放战士）在演习过十字街口时，有的同志为求迅速，便从墙角旁冲过去，解放战士当即认为不甚妥当，因为城里的敌人专门封锁墙根拐脚，如不注意，便要遭受损失。经大家研究后，想出了许多预防的办法。“奋战”部在演习攻坚中，更集合了所有的自动火器，由各部熟习其性能的射手及干部进行研究，得出如何掌握及发挥更大威力的办法后，即拿到各班排去进行教练，成效很大。所有部队，在此次练兵中，对创造与培养“独胆”英雄运动，均十分重视。由于这种英雄的、大量涌现，将对今后战斗所起作用极为重大，若干部队且已获得成绩。
