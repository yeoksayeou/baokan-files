　　Introducing Hungarian Communist Leader
    Mátyás Rákosi
    Bié Zhuó Fū
    Mátyás Rákosi is an outstanding national leader of modern democratic Hungary. In his youth, he actively participated in the workers' movement.

    During the Second World War, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army on the Eastern Front and was captured. In Russia, he witnessed the collapse of the Tsarist autocracy. In October 1918, Rákosi returned to Hungary, which had just been liberated from the oppression of the Habsburg dynasty. He was one of the founders of the Hungarian Communist Party. At that time, the Hungarian working class overthrew the bourgeois regime and embarked on the path of socialist revolution. As one of the leaders of this struggle, Rákosi was appointed as a government commissioner of the First Hungarian Soviet Republic. When counter-revolutionaries, encouraged and supported by the Allied Powers, attacked this young working-class country from all sides, Rákosi took up arms to defend it.

    After the failure of the Hungarian revolution, he had to flee the country and go into exile in the Soviet Union.

    The Hungarian Communist Party went underground. The counter-revolutionaries abolished all legal workers' organizations, but they could not completely eliminate them. Despite the extremely cruel terror, the communist movement not only continued to exist underground but also grew stronger. However, they lacked unified and strong leadership. Rákosi arrived in Hungary in the winter of 1924 and began to establish a closely united Hungarian Communist Party, making it a fighting revolutionary party of the working people. The work was carried out under unprecedented conditions. In 1925, due to the betrayal of a traitor, the entire staff of the underground organization headed by Rákosi fell into the hands of the Horthy executioners. The counter-revolutionaries handed Rákosi and his comrades over to a military tribunal, accusing them of attempting to establish an organization to overthrow the "legal" state and social order, and the prosecutor demanded the death penalty for the prisoners. At that time, the workers of the world united to save Rákosi. Under the pressure of protests from workers around the world, the counter-revolutionaries had to transfer him to an ordinary court. During the trial, the defendant became the plaintiff, and he bravely exposed all the evils of the bloody reactionaries.

    The sentence given to Rákosi read: eight and a half years of imprisonment. However, the unbearable pain and suffering inflicted on Rákosi by the Horthy executioners did not break his will to fight. He even led large-scale propaganda work in prison and guided the activities of the Party.

    The Horthy reactionary group was very afraid of Rákosi, and they did everything possible to prevent him from escaping their clutches. In 1934, before his sentence was about to expire, new events unfavorable to him occurred, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

    The development of the international situation led to the restoration of diplomatic relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union returned to the Hungarian people the banner of the revolutionary struggle of 1848. In this atmosphere of harmony, the Hungarian rulers released Rákosi. In October 1940, he gained freedom and the possibility of going to the Soviet Union.

    Rákosi's life and political activities have been closely linked to the struggle of the Hungarian Communist Party from beginning to end.

    When the executioner Horthy pushed the Hungarian people onto the road of disaster and forced them to participate in the criminal anti-Soviet war of aggression, the leaders of the Communist Party tirelessly called on the Hungarian people to unite under the banner of opposition to German fascism.

    The underground Hungarian Communist Party organized resistance movements in the country.

    The disastrous policies of the Hungarian reactionaries caused huge losses to the Hungarian people. Hungary, plundered and looted by Hitler, finally became a zone of military operations, while the Horthy group, like rats fleeing a sinking ship, had long since escaped to the West.

    The stormy events that followed clearly demonstrated that the 25 years of heroic struggle by Rákosi and the Hungarian Communist Party were not in vain. The liberation of Hungary from the shackles of fascism stunned all bourgeois parties, while the Communists held a program that fully met the needs of the times. This program of the Communist Party became the basis for the continued work of the "National Independence Front," which united all progressive democratic parties in Hungary.

    The sound of gunfire from the Battle of Budapest had not yet ceased when Rákosi arrived in the Hungarian capital. In his speech to Party activists, he analyzed the national situation and formulated the policy that remains the principled line of the Hungarian Communist Party to this day, which is to consolidate the position of genuine democrats in the various parties allied with the Hungarian Communist Party and to defend the "National Independence Front" by all means.

    As early as February 1945, he made an assessment of the Smallholders Party. Perhaps nothing could better illustrate Rákosi's rich political experience and his political foresight based on the practical application of Marxist-Leninist theory than this.

    He wrote at the time: "Undoubtedly, the reactionaries are trying to replay the trick of 1920, that is, to infiltrate the Smallholders Party, seize its leadership, and then try to undermine the unity of democratic forces and prevent the democratization of the country..."

    Later events fully confirmed Rákosi's keen observation.

    The young democratic Hungary was then on the eve of its first great battle, determined to give a decisive blow to the centuries-old stronghold of reaction (the Hungarian landowners). In the program of the Hungarian Communist Party, the primary task was to demand a thorough land reform. The implementation of land reform, as Rákosi said, was not only an important economic issue but also a political issue of decisive significance. Effectively solving the problem of rural democratization and consolidating the unity of workers and peasants were of national significance at that time and now.

    Rákosi said:

    "We should not forget that the Hungarian Communist Party is the party of all the working people of Hungary. Her policy is aimed at protecting the interests of the working people."

    In order to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, the Hungarian Communist Party has taken the first decisive step—resolutely carrying out land reform. Progressive intellectuals, their outstanding representatives, have found their way to join the Communist Party. These people, together with the working class, account for 95 percent of the total population. The Hungarian Communist Party, headed by Rákosi, has been waging an unyielding struggle for this political ideal of relying on the democracy of the working people.

    In his speech in February 1945, Rákosi pointed out that in post-war Hungary, the sharp class struggle and the fight of all democratic forces against the reactionaries had not stopped.

    In the autumn of 1945, when the Hungarian reactionaries fiercely attacked the democratic forces, Rákosi said:

    "We are the only party feared by the reactionaries. We are the only party that has never abandoned revolutionary ideals under 25 years of cruel and bloody pursuit. We are the uncompromising enemy of the reactionaries and the staunch and unwavering fighters for the cause of national unity."

    The Hungarian reactionaries, who had always placed their hopes on the contradictions between the major powers, have now gone underground. Supported by Western imperialists, they prepared anti-democratic and anti-republican conspiracies. Thanks to the vigilance of the democratic forces, especially the Hungarian Communist Party, their plans did not succeed. From the failure of the conspirators' plans to Nagy's departure, things developed at a very rapid pace. Nagy's departure completely exposed the reactionaries' attempts, plans, and connections. The leadership of the Smallholders Party has now passed into the hands of the democratic elements.

    The three-year plan for the restoration of the country, which was insisted on and passed by the Communist Party, has now become law. As a result of the 1947 elections, the Communist Party gained an important position in the government, becoming the largest party in the government, and continued to lead the Hungarian people forward on the road of continuing to consolidate democracy and prospering all economic and cultural sectors.

    Rákosi's life and activities are inextricably linked to the Party's struggle for the freedom and independence of the Hungarian people and the democratic prosperity of the country.

    An author who wrote a biography of Rákosi, when talking about the "private life" characteristics of this person who has now become the focus of attention of the whole of Hungary, emphasized: "Even those closest to him, besides knowing that his family has a wife and a young nephew (whose mother died at the hands of the fascists), cannot tell you anything else."

    Rákosi, who serves as Deputy Prime Minister, starts his work between six and seven in the morning and often works until after midnight. Despite such heavy work, Rákosi can still read many books. He not only likes literature very much but also likes science very much. He is a very educated person. He has a rare memory and can use six languages fluently.

    Abundant energy and extraordinary working ability further increased Rákosi's unique revolutionary optimism, which is due to his ability to skillfully, accurately, and cautiously estimate any phenomenon that is happening. When the Hungarian Communist Party embarked on the restoration of national construction from the unprecedentedly difficult environment after the war, Rákosi said: "We have been waiting for this for 25 years, and now we are prepared to face the difficulties before us, and we are willing to devote ourselves to the construction work."

　　介绍匈共领袖
    马蒂亚斯·拉科西
    别卓夫
    马蒂亚斯·拉科西（ＮａｔｙａｓＲａｋｏｓｉ），是现代民主匈牙利的一位卓越的国家领导者，他在青年时代，就已积极地参加了工人运动。
    第二次世界大战的时候，他在东线的奥匈帝国的军队中服役，并曾被俘。在俄国他亲眼看到沙皇专制制度的崩溃。一九一八年十月，拉科西回到了刚由哈普斯堡王朝压迫下解放出来的匈牙利。他是匈牙利共产党创建者之一。当时匈牙利的工人阶级，推翻了资产阶级政权走上了社会主义革命的大道。拉科西作为这一斗争的领导者之一，被委为第一匈牙利苏维埃共和国的政府委员。当反革命在协约国的鼓励与支持下，从各方面向这个年青的工人阶级的国家进攻时，拉科西就举起武器，来保卫它。
    匈牙利革命失败以后，他不得不逃出本国，流亡到苏联。
    匈牙利共产党转入地下了。反革命取消了一切合法的工人组织，但是没有能够把他们完全消灭。尽管有着极残酷的恐怖，共产主义运动不仅能继续在地下存在，而且更壮大起来了。然而他们却缺乏统一的，坚强的领导。拉科西于一九二四年冬到了匈牙利，着手建立紧密团结的匈牙利共产党，使其成为劳动人民的战斗的革命政党。工作在前所未闻的条件下开展着。一九二五年，由于叛徒的出卖，以拉科西为首的地下组织的整个参谋部，全部落入了霍尔梯刽子手的手中。反革命将拉科西及其同志加以企图建立推翻“合法的”国家秩序及社会秩序的组织的罪名，交给了军事法庭审判，检察长要求判犯人以死刑。当时，世界各国工人联合拯救了拉科西。在世界工人的抗议压力下，反革命不得不把他转交到普通法庭。在审讯中，被告成了原告，他勇敢地揭露了血腥的反动派的一切罪恶。
    给拉科西的判决书上写道：八年半徒刑。可是霍尔梯刽子手所加给拉科西的难忍的痛苦与磨难，并没有能够挫折他的斗争意志。他甚至在狱中还领导了规模宏大的宣传工作，指导着党的活动。
    霍尔梯的反动集团，非常惧怕拉科西，它们用一切办法使他不能逃出自己的魔爪。一九三四年，在他刑期将满以前，又发生了对他不利的新的事件，于是他被判终身苦役。
    国际形势的发展，使匈牙利恢复了与苏联的外交关系，苏联归还了匈牙利人民一八四八年革命斗争的旗帜，在这种和协的空气下，匈牙利统治者才释放了拉科西。一九四○年十月他得到了自由，并取得了到苏联去的可能。
    拉科西的生活及政治活动，是自始至终与匈牙利共产党的斗争紧密结合着的。
    当刽子手霍尔梯将匈国人民推向灾难的道路，并强迫他们参加罪恶的反苏侵略战争时，共产党的领导曾不倦地号召匈牙利人民，在反对德国法西斯的旗帜下，团结起来。
    地下的匈共在国内组织了抵抗运动。
    匈牙利反动派的罪恶政策，使匈牙利人民遭到了巨大的损失。被希特勒掠夺洗劫的匈牙利，终于变成了军事行动地带，而霍尔梯集团却象在快要沉没的船上逃走的耗子一样，早已逃到西方去了。
    接着暴风雨似的事变，明确地说明：拉科西及匈牙利共产党二十五年的英勇斗争，并不是徒劳的。匈牙利的从法西斯枷锁下解放出来，使得一切资产阶级政党目瞪口呆，而共产党人则握有完全适合时势要求的纲领，共产党的这个纲领，成了团结着匈牙利一切进步民主党派的“民族独立阵线”继续工作的根据。
    布达佩斯作战的枪声，还没有停息，拉科西就来到匈牙利的首都了。在他对党内活动分子的讲演中，他分析了全国的形势并制定了迄今仍为匈共原则路线的政策，这就是在与匈共结成同盟的各个党派中，巩固真正民主分子的地位，并用一切方法保卫“民族独立阵线。”
    还在一九四五年二月，他就给小农党作了一个估计，大概再没有比这件事能够更好地说明拉科西的丰富政治经验及其根据实际应用马列主义理论的政治预见之才能了。
    他当时写道：“无疑，反动派企图重演一九二○年的把戏，就是说，打进小农党，掌握其领导权，然后努力破坏民主力量的统一，并阻止国家的民主化。………”
    后来的事变完全证实了拉科西这个明锐的观察。
    青年的民主匈牙利，当时处于首次大搏斗的前夜，它决定给几百年来的反动堡垒（匈牙利大地主），以决定性的突击。在匈共的纲领中，占首要地位的就是要求彻底的土地改革。土改的推行，正象拉科西所讲的一样，不仅是一个重要的经济问题，而且是一个具有决定意义的政治问题。有效的解决农村民主化问题及巩固工人与农民的团结，在当时和现在，都是具有全民性的意义的。
    拉科西说：
    “我们不应该忘记，匈共是匈牙利全体劳动人民的党。她的政策是以保护劳动人民的利益为目的的。”
    为了加强工农团结，匈共已经走了有决定意义的第一步——坚决地进行土地改革。进步的知识分子，他们的优秀代表，已经找到了加入共产党的道路。这些人们，与工人阶级一起，占全人口的百分之九十五。以拉科西为首的匈共，正是为了依靠劳动人民的民主这个政治理想，才进行了不屈不挠的斗争。
    拉科西在一九四五年二月的讲演中指出：在战后的匈牙利，尖锐的阶级斗争、一切民主力量对反动派的战斗，还没有停止。
    一九四五年秋，当匈牙利的反动派，激烈地向民主势力进攻时，拉科西讲道：
    “我们是反动派所惧怕的唯一的政党。我们是在二十五年残酷血腥的追缉下、从未离开革命理想的唯一政党。我们是反动派绝不妥协的敌人，是为民族团结事业，坚决不渝的战士。”
    始终将希望寄托于各大国矛盾之上的匈牙利反动派，现在转入到地下了。他们在西方帝国主义者支持下，准备了反民主反共和国的阴谋。由于民主力量、首先是匈共的警觉，他们的计划没有成功。从阴谋者的计划失败直到纳基的出走，事情以非常的速度发展着。纳基的出走，完全揭穿了反动派的的企图、计划及其联系。小农党的领导现已转到民主分子的手中了。
    为共产党所坚持通过的恢复国家的三年计划，现已成为法律。一九四七年选举的结果，共产党在政府中取得了重要的席位，成为政府中的第一大党，在继续巩固民主及繁荣一切经济及文化部门的大道上，继续领导着匈牙利人民向前迈进。
    拉科西的生活及活动，无时无刻不与党的、为匈牙利人民的自由与独立、国家的民主繁荣的斗争联系着。
    为拉科西写传记的一位作者，在讲到这位现已成为整个匈牙利所注视的人物的“私生活”特点时，着重地写道：“甚至和他最亲近的人，除了知道他的家庭中有妻子和小侄儿（其母死于法西斯分子手中）以外，也再不能告诉你什么了。”
    身任副总理的拉科西，其工作时间是由早晨六——七点开始，常常一直工作到半夜以后。虽然工作这样繁重，拉科西仍然可以读许多书。他不仅非常喜欢文学，而且也很喜欢科学。他是一个非常有教养的人。他有着稀有的记忆力，并能熟练地使用六种语言。
    充沛的精力及非凡的工作能力，更增加了拉科西特有的革命乐观主义，这是由于他能够熟练地、准确地、谨慎地估计任何正在发生的现象。当匈共由战后空前的困难环境走上恢复国家建设时，拉科西说：“这个我们已期待了二十五年了，而现在我们准备正视摆在我们面前的困难，我们愿意将自己投于建设工作中。”
