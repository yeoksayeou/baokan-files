　　Taiyue District Party Committee Organ
  　Thoroughly Cleans Up Organ Property
    [Taiyue News] The Taiyue District Party Committee organ resolutely implemented the decision of the Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau to clean up organ production, breaking the previous departmentalism and "lying low" mentality. All property that should be turned over to the public was handed over. The eighteen production units of the organ surrendered a surplus of 336,924 jin of millet, 28,795,156 yuan of Jicha banknotes, 69,824.9 square chi of homespun cloth, three mules and horses, and some cotton, gold, silver, etc., all to the Administrative Office. Some firearms were also handed over to the Public Security Bureau. The organ only retained 71,834,458 yuan as a production fund. Individual shares invested in production were withdrawn. After careful review, the sources of 17 people's shares were found to be improper (such as from selling firearms, embezzlement, feudal property, etc.), totaling 415,310 yuan, 160 jin of rice, and 60 jin of wheat, all of which were handed over to the public. These people were given penalties ranging from removal from office to demerits, depending on the severity of the circumstances. After this cleanup, there were several benefits: First, the burden on the people was reduced. Second, the organ's production, apart from industrial and agricultural production, was transferred to private individuals as much as possible, which can both develop mass production and free up many personnel to do mass work, reducing the leadership's burden of these complex affairs.

　　太岳区党委机关
  　彻底清理机关财产
    【太岳讯】太岳区党委机关坚决执行晋冀鲁豫中央局清理机关生产的决定，打破过去的本位主义、打埋伏的思想，把该交公的财产一律交公，机关十八个生产单位，剩余小米三十三万六千九百二十四斤，冀钞二千八百七十九万五千一百五十六元，土布六万九千八百二十四方尺九方寸，骡马三头和一部分棉花、金、银等，统统交给了行署。有些枪支也都交给了公安局。机关只留下七千一百八十三万四千四百五十八元做生产基金。投资生产的个人股金抽出来，经过慎重审查，来源不正当的（如因卖枪支、贪污、封建财产等）有十七人的四十一万五千三百一十元，米一百六十斤，麦子六十斤，都交了公。这些人按情节轻重，分别给予撤职或记过的处分。这样清理了以后，有几个好处：第一，减轻了人民负担。第二，机关的生产，除工农业生产外，尽量的转移给私人，既可发展群众的生产，又可抽出不少人员去做群众工作，减少领导上对于这些繁杂事务的负担。
