　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 23rd: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Hong Kong on the 19th, 2,000 representatives from Chinese industrial circles and various social, political, and cultural organizations in Hong Kong held a mass rally to protest "the United States' assistance in the revival of Japanese industry and the dumping of Japanese goods in the world market." The Hong Kong "Chinese Manufacturers' Association" also sent telegrams to Truman, Marshall, United Nations Secretary-General Lie, and British Prime Minister Attlee after the meeting, protesting the U.S. policy of supporting Japan, pointing out that Japan's threat may overwhelm Hong Kong's textile industry. It also warned that the policy of the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan is still to restore the pre-war status of Japanese industrial giants, which is a serious threat to all countries and world peace.
