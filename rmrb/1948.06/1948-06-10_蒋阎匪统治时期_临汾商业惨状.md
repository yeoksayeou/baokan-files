　　The Tragic State of Commerce in Linfen During the Chiang-Yan Bandit Rule
　　Ke Ren
　　During the period when the Chiang-Yan bandit troops ruled Linfen City, there were formally over 400 businesses, but in reality, these businesses had become a group of vendors. If we were to calculate based on the original storefronts, small vendors selling peanuts and melon seeds accounted for a quarter of the entire commerce, cooked food businesses accounted for seventy or eighty, and excluding barbershops, watch repair shops, vegetable shops, and other trades, there were only ninety decent merchants, and even they opened their doors without goods.
　　Under the rule of the bandit troops, merchants could not sustain themselves due to the rampant devaluation of the puppet currency and the heavy burden of exorbitant taxes. In terms of commercial taxes, there were business tax, profit tax, income tax, stamp tax, license tax, and so on. As for the severity of the taxes, a small restaurant like Shuanghelong had to pay 120,000 yuan per month for the business tax alone. In the collection of tobacco tax, a quantity of green tobacco worth 10,000 yuan was taxed at 12,000 yuan. In addition, there were numerous local grain levies, such as grain purchased on credit, grain purchased on behalf, military purchase grain, ensured reserve grain, requisitioned grain, school funding, and local militia funding. From January to June of last year alone, the amount of grain purchased on behalf was three to four thousand shi (approximately 300-400 tons), ostensibly at a "issued price," but in reality, only half was given, and it was weighed heavily when taken in and the price was suppressed when issuing payment. By the time the money reached the merchants, prices had risen again, and often not even half of the real value was received. In the past, merchants in Linfen not only had to pay grain taxes and levies but also had to frequently supply tables, chairs, bed boards, pots, bowls, chopsticks, and so on. In winter, they also had to provide stoves and fuel. Usually, transporting coal and grain, employing carpenters and plasterers, and so on, all had to be borne by the merchants. Last year, Xiechang Store had to provide carpenters and plasterers five times and vehicles three times in a single month. At the time, hiring a vehicle cost 120,000 yuan, and hiring a worker cost 30,000 yuan, resulting in tens of millions of yuan in informal expenses. In addition, there were consolation fees for festivals and seasons. Under such numerous and extortionate taxes, more than 300 of the city's 400 merchants this year requested to close their businesses, but the puppet government, fearing that no one would bear the burden, did not approve any of them. Manager Li of Xiechang said: "If they were approved, all the merchants would close down."
　　Under the rule of the bandit troops, merchants also suffered from the squeeze of bureaucratic capital. Renfagong, Wang Jingwei's bank, not only could arbitrarily extract high interest rates but also had the special privilege of privately mortgaging and closing down private businesses. Xiehetai was sealed off because it could not repay its debts, and the manager was detained for more than two months. Dozens of businesses went bankrupt due to the debt exploitation by Renfagong. Last year, the goods in Linfen were all supplied by a few airplanes in the sky, but ordinary merchants had no right to enter the airport. Most of the goods were monopolized by bureaucratic businesses, and ordinary merchants could not even obtain cigarettes. If they bought from official merchants, the cost would be high, and sales would become a problem. Therefore, under the monopolistic hoarding of the Yan bandit trading company, the prices of goods rose several times a day. In September of last year, the bandit trading company absorbed a large amount of private merchants' matches. In just half a month, the price of matches rose from 290,000 yuan per box to 1.5 million yuan, causing many merchants to sell cheaply and buy dearly. Following this bureaucratic capital, a fifth of the city's merchants were related to "public" enterprises. They relied on bureaucratic capital, using the "public" signboard, and their businesses could be unorganized, exempt from travel, and avoid burdens, thus increasing the burden on private merchants.
　　It is hard to imagine trade freedom for Linfen merchants. They cannot stop their business, but they still have to pay the fees. Wang Wushan of Lihua Bookstore closed down but still had to bear the burden; if he couldn't afford it, he would be detained for half a month. At the same time, merchants must have a five-household joint guarantee system, and they must have a road permit to enter and leave the city. In order to prevent young men from escaping military service, the bandit troops generally did not approve merchants under the age of forty-seven to go out to sell goods. Usually, hiring a car to transport coal out of the city required three loading and unloading operations under the strict inspection of layers of sentry posts. The owner of Xiang Sheng Optical Shop said angrily: "They made excuses to prevent bullets from leaving the city, and the cabbage they bought back was crushed by them before it even got home."
　　The most headache for Linfen merchants was the so-called city defense burden of the bandit troops. No matter how much the merchants were squeezed until they could hardly breathe, the puppet government, in order to maintain its reactionary rule, in the beginning of this year, in the name of preparing for war, extorted the merchants to use all their wealth to prepare three months of food, otherwise they would be driven out of the city. With great difficulty, everyone prepared everything in March, but the bandit troops immediately apportioned a lot of military grain. When the grain was taken away, they wanted "contributed grain." It was stipulated that each merchant household, in addition to keeping two months of food, would have their materials confiscated and people punished if they privately possessed but did not donate. Under this threat, the masses had no choice but to hand over everything. But immediately afterwards, "purchased-on-behalf grain" was assigned. At that time, there was really no grain to buy anywhere, but the puppet government personnel shamelessly took the grain squeezed from the people out of the warehouse and sold it to the masses as "purchased-on-behalf grain." In addition, door panels, rafters, tables, stools, water tanks, iron pots, paper, and even the cloth of the merchants, became military supplies and could be requisitioned at any time. In two months, Xiechang Store exported 2,500 pockets, and even the Yuanxinghe vegetable stall exported 800. Many people were forced to sew quilts and clothes into pockets and hand them over to the bandit troops. As for consolation, it was like scraping a comb over the head, the chamber of commerce went, then the students came, the students left, and the soldiers wanted it again. Tong Sheng Optical Shop was assigned 10 million yuan in consolation money alone, forcing them to take out twenty pairs of glasses to offset the payment. There was more than just one household like them in the city.
　　Although the merchants bore such heavy donations, the bandit troops still forced them to die for them, leveling bunkers and building fortresses for the bandit troops. When the accountant of Tong Sheng Optical Shop was forced to level the bunkers, the gunfire was very tight. He said to the bandit troops, "There are Eighth Route Army soldiers in front." At this time, the bandit troops held the guns in their hands and said, "You are afraid of the Eighth Route Army's guns, aren't you afraid of my guns!" As a result, the accountant was forced to die. Tong Sheng Optical Shop not only lost an accountant but also had several apprentices seized and drafted into the army. In the end, only the shopkeeper was left, and he still had to do construction work. There was more than just one household like them in the city.
　　After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, their discipline was strict, and they effectively protected industry and commerce. The people had a deeper understanding of the cruelty of the Chiang-Yan bandit rule. They couldn't help but say with joy: "Your attack on Linfen was completely in accordance with the will of heaven and the response of the people. If you hadn't come, the people would have starved to death."

　　蒋阎匪统治时期
  　临汾商业惨状
    克仁
    在蒋阎匪军统治临汾城的时期，形式上保持了四百多家商业，实际上这些买卖变成了一群摊贩。要是计算过去门面的话，卖花生瓜子的小商贩就占了整个商业的四分之一，熟食行又占了七八十家，至于理发、修表、菜铺等行除外，仅有九十家象样的商人，也是无货开门。
    商人们在匪军统治下，由于伪币泛值，加上苛捐杂税繁重，无法维持。在商业税上，有营业税、利得税、所得税、印花税、版照税等。至于税重的程度，双合龙小饭铺每月仅营业税一项，就缴十二万元。在烟草税的征收上，价值一万元的青条烟草，征税就是一万二千元。此外，又有名目繁多的地方粮款，如赊购粮、代购粮、军购粮、确备粮、屯借粮、学校经费、地方团队经费等。去年一至六月间，仅代购粮就派了三四千石，虽美其名“发价”，但实际只给半数，再加大秤收进，压价不发，等钱到商人手时，物价不知又涨了多少，常常连半数也得不上。过去临汾的商人，不仅要交纳粮食捐税，还须经常支应桌椅、床板、锅碗筷等，冬天还要火炉、烟等。平时运炭、运粮，用木工、泥工等，无不要商人负担。协昶商店去年一个月，出木泥匠五次，派车三回，当时雇一辆车十二万，雇一工三万，无形中出款几十万元。另外还有过节过季的慰劳费。商人在此多如牛毛的捐税敲榨下，今年全城四百多家商户，就有三百多家要求歇业，伪政府怕没人负担，全部没有批准。协昶的李掌柜说：要是批准的话，商人就会全部歇业。
    商人在匪军统治下，同时遭受着官僚资本的排挤。仁发恭是王靖国的银号，他们不仅可以随意高利盘剥，而且有私押和封闭私人买卖的特权。协和泰因还不起债封了门，经理被扣两个多月。商人在仁发恭债务剥夺下，就有几十家倒闭。去年一年间，临汾的货物均仰给天空中的少数飞机，但是普通商人无权进飞机场，货物大部被官僚买卖所垄断，普通商人甚至连纸烟也贩不到手。若再从官商手中去买，成本又大，推销就成了问题。因此阎匪贸易公司在垄断居奇之下，货物一日数涨。去年九月间，匪贸易公司大量吸收私商洋火，仅在半月时间内，洋火每箱由二十九万元涨至一百五十万元，害得许多商人廉卖贵买。跟着这种官僚资本而来的，就是全市占五分之一的与“公营”事业有关系的商人，他们投靠官僚资本，打着“公家”招牌，营业可以不编组，不出差，躲避负担，因此又加重了私商的负担。
    临汾商人贸易自由是很难想象的。他们不能停业，款项仍得照出。利华书店王武山歇业了，还要负担；出不起就被扣半月。同时商人必须有五家连环保，出入城都得有路条。匪军为了防止青壮年逃避兵役，凡年在四十七岁以下的商人出外贩货，概不批准。平时顾车出城运一次煤，在层层岗哨严格的检查下，就需装卸三次。向生眼镜店的老板气得说：他们借口防止枪炮子弹出城，买回的白菜不到家就叫他们捏烂了。
    临汾的商人最头痛的，莫过于匪军所谓守城负担。不管商人怎样被压榨得喘不过气来，伪政府为了维持自己的反动统治，今年初却以备战为名，勒商人们尽其所有财富，准备食粮三个月，否则赶出城外。好容易各家在三月间准备齐全，匪军马上就摊派下许多军粮，当粮食拿去不久，却又要“献粮”。规定每户商人除留两个月食用外，若私有不捐者，物资没收，人受处罚。在此种威胁下，群众只好尽数缴出。但是紧接着又派来了“代购粮”，当时实在到处无粮可买，伪政府的人员却厚颜无耻的把从百姓压榨来的粮食又从仓库里取出来卖给群众作为“代购粮”。此外，门板、椽子、桌凳、水缸、铁锅、纸张，甚至买卖人的布，都成了军用品，随时可以征用。在两个月中，协昶商店出口袋二千五百条，就是元兴合菜摊也出了八百条，许多人逼得连被子、衣服都缝成口袋缴给匪军。至于慰劳，就象篦梳在头上刮一样，商会去了学生又来，学生走了当兵的又要。同生眼镜店光慰劳款就派了一万万元，逼得无法，只好拿出去二十付眼镜顶款。
    虽然商人们负担如此苛重的捐款，但是匪军还逼着他们去送死，替匪军平碉筑堡。同生眼镜店的管帐先生被迫去平碉的时候，枪打的很紧，他对匪军说：“前面有八路军”，这时匪军却握着手中的枪说：“你怕八路军的枪，你就不怕我的枪！”结果逼得管帐先生送了命。同生眼镜店不仅死了一个管帐先生，而且把几个学徒抓去当了兵，最后仅剩下掌柜的，仍得去做工事。城内象他们这样的户，并不只一家。
    解放军入城以后，军纪严明，切实保护工商业，人民更深刻认识了蒋阎匪统治的残酷，他们不禁喜形于色的说：“你们打临汾，完全是顺天应时的，要不是你们来，老百姓就要饿死了”。
