Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th—Various sources reveal that as the traitorous, anti-people rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families increasingly approaches its end, they are transferring vast amounts of wealth, looted from the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, to the United States and South America. According to He Yongji's New York dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on April 11th, Wallace exposed the new fact that "many key figures in the Chinese government have purchased properties near New York." To facilitate the smooth transfer of assets to Brazil by the four big families, Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to Brazil, Guo Taiqi, is actively negotiating immigration matters with the Brazilian government. Guo openly admitted this in a conversation with a reporter from Brazil's "Globo Night News" on April 13th. Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Trust Bureau" officially established an American insurance branch in New York on May 6th. According to Guo Taiqi, the Soong-affiliated Bank of China will also establish a branch in Brazil. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on April 18th, citing "reliable sources," Chinese assets are being transferred in large quantities from the United States to South American banks, especially in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. During a meeting of the Chiang-controlled Legislative Yuan on the 12th of this month, a legislator revealed in a speech that "overseas Chinese private property" has increased to four billion US dollars (according to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing). When Wei Demai announced at Chiang Kai-shek's "State Council" meeting on August 22nd of last year that "Chinese property in the United States" amounted to 1.5 billion US dollars, the United Press immediately pointed out that this figure was two to three times less than what was usually reported.

　　四大家族接近死亡
  　蒋宋孔陈转移财产
  　搜刮巨量财富移美
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方消息透露：蒋宋孔陈四大家族在其卖国反人民统治日益接近死亡时，正将其搜刮中国人民血汗所得巨量财富转移到美国和南美。据四月十一日天津大公报载何永佶纽约通讯称：华莱士曾揭露“中国政府要人多有在纽约附近置买产业”的新事实。为了使四大家族能顺利将财产转移至巴西，蒋驻巴西大使郭泰祺积极与巴西政府进行移民谈判。四月十三日郭在向巴西“环球晚报”记者谈话中曾公开供认此事。蒋介石的“中央信托局”已于五月六日在纽约正式设立美国保险分处。宋系中国银行，据郭泰祺称，亦将在巴西设立分行。另据美联社四月十八日南京电引“可靠消息”称：中国资产正大量自美国转往南美银行，尤其是阿根廷、巴西和秘鲁。本月十二日蒋记立法院会议中，一立法委员发言披露：“国外华人私产”已增加到四十亿美元（据合众社南京电）。去年八月二十二日魏德迈在蒋介石的“国务会议”中宣布“中国人在美国的财产”为十五亿美元时，合众社即曾指出这个数字比经常报导者要少两三倍。
