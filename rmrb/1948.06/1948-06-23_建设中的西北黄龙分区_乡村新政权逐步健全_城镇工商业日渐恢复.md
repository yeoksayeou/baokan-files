Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st—The newly established rural regime in the Huanglong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is gradually improving. In early March, when the Northwest People's Liberation Army advanced to the Huanglong area, the people of the district automatically smashed the Baojia (household registration system) signboards, tore up "ID cards," and abolished the "collective responsibility system" and other fascist tools of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime. With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, they successively established democratic regimes. When our army besieged Luochuan, all village regimes except for those around the city's positions were quickly established. For example, the masses in Dongxi Beixin and Luo villages near the city suburbs held villagers' meetings amidst the booming of cannons, voting by throwing beans. After the election in Lingqian Village in the county, the masses immediately discussed and stipulated the new village head's tasks at the meeting: (1) to help the poor to turn over; (2) to lead production; (3) to implement government decrees; (4) to support the front; (5) to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, and solve the difficulties of the masses. There were many successful examples in the establishment of the new regime. For example, after liberation, a certain township in the Chengguan District of Yijun County conducted a survey of residents, mobilized the masses to discuss relief issues, and paid attention to discovering and cultivating active backbone elements. Later, when the new regime was established, most of these activists were elected. They were generally fair, honest, credible, and progressive working peasants. According to materials from Luosheng District of the county, among the 64 village chiefs and deputy chiefs, 36 were poor peasants, one was a worker, four were tenant farmers, 19 were middle peasants, and four were wealthy middle peasants. However, in some villages, the masses were not mobilized thoroughly, and the elections were not cautious enough. For example, the director of an administrative village in the third township of Yong'an District in Yichuan County was a rogue element. The village chief of another village colluded with the landlord, engaging in bad practices such as embezzling grain, forcing apportionment, and showing favoritism. At the beginning, the fourth township of Longquan District in Hancheng lacked publicity and education, and the elected township head was corrupt, concealed enemy and puppet materials, but later, when the masses understood the new regime, they rose up to replace him and elected a township head who satisfied the masses, and cleared out 90 enemy-hidden mortars and landmines and other materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st—The industry and commerce of Luochuan, Yichuan, Hancheng, Chaoyang,中部 (unable to translate) , Yijun, Huanglong and other seven counties in the newly established Huanglong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were extremely depressed before liberation due to years of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and various extortions. Furthermore, they suffered heavy losses in capital and goods due to looting by the Yan (an) Luo (chuan) bandits when they fled. This made it impossible for most to continue opening their doors, markets stagnated, and there was a severe shortage of essential civilian goods. With the efforts of our democratic government and the Northwest Trading Company and the Northwest Farmers Bank, it has now gradually recovered. Luochuan City suffered the worst enemy looting. Now, 60-70% of the shops have reopened. The commerce of Hancheng is even more active. Many merchants who were forced away by the enemy have returned to reorganize their old businesses, and merchants from the Chiang area have also come to the liberated area to do business, and prices are becoming more stable. Since late March, the Northwest Trading Corporation and the Northwest Farmers Bank have transported large quantities of goods to various county towns to restore the market, using agricultural currency. Up to now, branch companies and branch banks have been established in all seven counties. The trading company has also established four retail departments in Luochuan, Yichuan, Hancheng, and Huanglong counties, transporting 130,000 catties of salt, more than 20,000 catties of clear oil, and native cloth, cotton, and other goods to the market to solve the needs of the people and regulate prices. At the same time, it is making every effort to support the resumption of private industrial and commercial businesses, in addition to loans, it is also helping existing factories to restore production by lending raw materials and purchasing finished products. For example, a private paper mill in Beiguan, Hancheng, borrowed 14 million yuan in agricultural currency loans. Another textile factory in the city borrowed cotton worth more than 11 million yuan and signed a contract with the trading company that if the factory's cloth could not be paid for on the market for a while, the company would purchase it or exchange it for cotton to facilitate capital turnover and expand production. Other factories such as the iron smelting plant in Hancheng, the match factory in Yichuan, and the soap factory in Luochuan have all received support from the trading company. The company also wholesales large quantities of goods at low prices to support the resumption of business for peddlers and small merchants in the area. At the same time, it is carrying out grain leveling in Luochuan. In order to reduce the losses suffered by the people from Chiang currency, the Northwest Farmers Bank specially set up exchange offices to redeem it. In Hancheng alone, 200 million yuan of Chiang currency was redeemed on May 13th.

　　建设中的西北黄龙分区
  　乡村新政权逐步健全
  　城镇工商业日渐恢复
    【新华社西北二十一日电】陕甘宁边区新建立的黄龙分区乡村政权已逐渐健全。三月初，当西北人民解放军进至黄龙地区时，该区人民即纷纷自动捣碎保甲门牌，撕毁“身份证”，废除“连坐法”等一套蒋匪法西斯统治工具，并在解放军协助下，相继建立了民主政权。当我军围攻洛川时，除城周阵地以外，所有村政权都迅速建立。如城郊附近的东西贝新、罗村等村的群众就是在炮声隆隆中召开村民大会，用投豆的方法进行了投票。该县岭前村选举完毕，群众立即在会上讨论并规定了新村长的任务：（一）帮助穷人翻身；（二）领导生产；（三）执行政府法令；（四）支援前线；（五）兴利除弊，解决群众困难。在新政权建立中，有许多成功的例子。如宜君城关区某乡于解放后经过居民调查，发动群众讨论救济问题，注意发现与培养了积极骨干分子。而在后来新政权建立时，这些积极分子大部当选，他们一般都是公道正派有成信、要求进步的劳动农民。据该县洛生区材料，六十四位正副村长中，贫农有三十六人，工人一人，佃农四人，中农十九人，富裕中农四人。但也有部分乡村因未深入发动群众，选举不够慎重，如宜川永安区三乡某行政村主任即系一流氓分子。另一村村长则和地主勾结，工作中有贪污粮食、强迫摊派、耍私情等坏作风。韩城龙泉区四乡开始因缺乏宣传教育，当选的乡长贪污舞弊，隐瞒敌伪物资，但后来群众对新政权有了认识，便起来撤换了他，另选了群众所满意的乡长，并清出敌人暗藏迫击炮弹九十枚及地雷等物资。
    【新华社西北二十一日电】陕甘宁边区新建立的黄龙分区洛川、宜川、韩城、＠阳、中部、宜君、黄龙等七县工商业，在解放前经多年苛捐杂税及种种勒索，本极萧条；又遭延（安）洛（川）胡匪逃窜时洗劫，资金、货物捐失极重，致大部无法继续开门，市场停顿，民用必需品极感缺乏。经我民主政府及西北贸易公司、西北农民银行努力扶植，现已日渐恢复。遭敌抢劫最惨的洛川市。现已有十之六七商店开门。韩城商业则更为活跃，被敌迫走的商人多已返回重理旧业，蒋区商人亦来解放区营业，物价日趋平稳。三月下旬以来，西北贸易总公司及西北农民银行搞带农币转运大批货物至各县城镇恢复市场，截至目前，七县都已建立了支公司与支行。贸易公司并在洛、宜、韩、黄四县设立了四个门市部，运到食盐十三万斤，清油两万多斤及土布、棉花等应市，解决民需，调剂物价。同时全力扶持私营工商复业，除贷款外，并以出贷原料，收购成品等办法扶助原有工厂恢复生产。如韩城北关一私营纸厂，即借得农币贷款一千四百万元。该城另一纺织厂借得价值一千一百多万元的棉花，并与贸易公司订有合同，如该厂布匹市场一时不能缴纳，即由公司收购或换给棉花，以利资金流转扩大生产。其他如韩城的炼铁厂，宜川的火柴厂，洛川的肥皂厂等，都获得贸易公司的支持。该公司并低价批发大批货物，扶持该区摊贩小商复业。同时在洛川进行粮食平均。西北农民银行为减免人民所受蒋币的捐失，特设兑换所收兑，仅韩城在五月十三日一天中即收兑两亿元蒋币。
