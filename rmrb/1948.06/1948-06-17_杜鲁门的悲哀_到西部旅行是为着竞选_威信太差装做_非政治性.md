　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, New York dispatch: Truman's "non-political" trip to the western states, which began on the 3rd evening, has failed to achieve its goal of increasing his political capital. According to newspapers, only 1,200 people attended Truman's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, in a hall that could hold 10,000 people. The Chicago Sun and Times stated that the large group of reporters following Truman were deeply shocked by the vast empty spaces in the hall during Truman's speech; the newspaper also claimed that not since Hoover had a president encountered so many empty seats in the Midwest. In the past few days, Truman's "non-political" trip has become a favorite topic for famous humorists. Truman's trip to the western states is actually an election trip, but because his reputation is so poor, he fears that no one will support him, so he pretends to be on a "non-political" trip to see how things look.

　　杜鲁门的悲哀
  　到西部旅行是为着竞选
  　威信太差装做“非政治性”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：杜鲁门三日晚所开始的至西部各州的“非政治性”旅行并未达到增加其政治资本的目的。据报纸载称：在内布拉斯加州俄马哈可容万人的大厅中，到场听取杜氏演说者仅一千二百人而已。芝加哥太阳与时报称，跟随杜鲁门的大批记者，深为杜氏演说时大厅中的广大空位所震惊；该报并称，自胡佛以来，还没有一个总统在中西部碰见过这样多的空位子。过去数日中杜鲁门的“非政治性”旅行，已成为著名幽默家们最爱谈论的主题。按杜鲁门这次到西部各州旅行，实际上是竞选旅行，但因自己威信太差，怕没有人拥护，乃装做“非政治性”的旅行，以便好看风色。
