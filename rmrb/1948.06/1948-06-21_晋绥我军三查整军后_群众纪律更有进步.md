Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th: After the Jin-Sui Liberation Army underwent the new-style Three Check-Ups and Rectification Campaign, discipline towards the masses has improved even more. In a certain unit in southern Jin, the 11th Company, due to a large number of people and small villages, things were very crowded. Squad Leader Sun Sanxi saw that the old landlord had nowhere to live, so he immediately invited him back to sleep on the bed, while he and the soldiers slept on the ground. This matter quickly spread throughout the entire company, and "Learn from Sun Sanxi" became the action slogan of the whole company.

During the march, the unit universally carried out the "Three No-Go" movement: "Do not leave without saying goodbye, do not leave without cleaning up, do not leave without completing the procedures." In cases of urgent military action, it was stipulated that each unit would designate a specific person to handle these matters. The vanguard troops put up discipline signs by the roadside, with the inscription: "Do not trample on the green crops." If anyone inadvertently violated this, the disciplinary team would immediately call them out.

A certain company, starting with unifying the thinking of cadres and soldiers, enabled them to consciously abide by discipline. Wherever the company went, they would help the masses carry water. The masses in a certain place presented them with a silk banner, inscribed with: "Model Army in Mass Discipline." Many units have established discipline duty officers.

Whenever the troops set off, a member of the mass work team would go door-to-door to inquire whether anything was damaged. If there was any damage, they would definitely compensate for it, and they would clean up the residence before leaving the village. In a certain village in the new district, when the masses took shelter in the mountain gullies from enemy bombing, our army entered the village and saw an old man's house with a jar of wine and a group of chickens laying eggs. A certain platoon leader immediately sealed the wine jar and took responsibility for protecting the chickens and eggs. After the landlord returned home, he handed over the wine, chickens, and eggs one by one. The landlord praised our army's spirit of strictly observing mass discipline.

　　晋绥我军三查整军后
  　群众纪律更有进步
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】晋绥解放军经三查新式整军后，群众纪律较前更好。晋南某部十一连在行军宿营中，因人多村小，十分拥挤，班长孙三喜见房东老汉无住处，立即把他请回来睡在床上，自己和战士们睡在地上。此事顷刻传遍全连，“向孙三喜学习”，成为全连行动口号。该部在行军中普遍进行了“不告辞不走，不打扫不走，不清理手续不走”的三不走运动。军事行动紧急者，规定由各单位指定专人办理此事。前卫部队在路边插上纪律牌，上书：“不要踏青苗”。偶有不慎违犯者，纠查队立刻就叫起来。某部一连从打通干部和战士思想着手，使能自觉地遵守纪律。该连走到哪里就给群众担水。某地群众赠以锦旗，上书：“群众纪律模范军”。许多部队都建立了纪律值班员。某部民运组组员，每当部队出发时，都挨户询问是否损坏东西，如有损坏一定赔偿，并将住处打扫干净才出村庄。新区某村群众在敌机轰炸下避入山沟，我军进入该村时，见一老乡屋内有酒一坛和一群正在下蛋的鸡，某排长立刻把酒瓶加封，对于鸡和蛋也负责保护，等房东回家后把酒、鸡和蛋都一一点交清楚，房东对我军此种严守群众纪律的精神，称赞不已。
