　　Yan Xishan's Sorrow
　　Guo Feng

　　The bandit Yan Xishan feels very sad that he has become the People's Liberation Army's "recruiting station and arms transportation network." On November 15th of last year, at the "Eighth Anniversary Celebration of the Iron Army Organization," he slammed the table at his officers above the rank of school and yelled: "If we don't reincarnate, in a few years, our cadres and soldiers today will all become enemies who kill us!" What is "reincarnation"? It is to strengthen the secret service organization in his army. He ordered the entire army to gather 88,000 "Iron Army backbone seedlings" in units of divisions for phased training. From these, he selected those who were "loyal and unwavering" and "ashamed of being inferior to others" and sent them to him for "personal training." He painstakingly created a set of ghostly tricks, calling the "personally trained" "Iron Army backbone" "Iron Pillars." The leader and deputy leader of a squad were "Iron Main Beams" and "Iron Secondary Beams," and each of the four "Iron Pillars" led two "Iron" soldiers, forming "Iron" cells to create an "Iron Squad Furnace." With "Iron Squads," "Iron Platoons," "Iron Companies," "Iron Battalions," "Iron Regiments," "Iron Divisions," and "Iron Armies" would quickly follow. With an "Iron Army," they could be "unbreakable, indestructible, able to attack and destroy the enemy, and defend and annihilate the enemy." He also considered the "Iron Pillars" to be "superior soldiers" and "real cock cadres." This bandit Yan's imagination is truly rich. He also taught this group of lackeys to memorize some lies that slander the Communist Party, established "Speaking Teams," and told them to "speak enthusiastically to everyone," "definitely saying it thousands of times," because he believed that "deceiving people depends on speaking a lot." Finally, he gave them the task of ensuring that there was no "camouflage" in the squad. Wang Jingguo explained the word "camouflage" by saying, "They are not our (Yan's) people, pretending to be our people, looking the same on the surface, but their hearts are different." According to Yan himself, all ten of the freely recruited soldiers (captured soldiers) were "camouflage." He also taught them a set of techniques for doing secret service work, such as "bean-picking filtration, encirclement-style interviews, rotational warnings, and tail-tracking surveillance," and so on. This group of lackeys returned to their respective units after completing their training. Yan valued them very much, treating them as the last pillars of his collapsing and decaying regime. Shen Jiangang, the acting company commander of the 7th Company of the 3rd Regiment of the Yan bandit's Provisional 49th Division, and Meng Guangqiang, the acting platoon leader, were ignorant. Because their attitude towards "Iron Army backbone" Guo Yingshan was not good, they were both dismissed. Yang Xinxi, the platoon leader of the 4th Company, was detained by the regiment and confined for a week for criticizing "Iron Army backbone" Song Yuqing in a speech before the team. Therefore, after these backbones returned to their units, they did whatever they wanted without any scruples, immediately "stirring up a wave of purging camouflage" in the army, creating an atmosphere of terror. Yan believed that the combat results were good and became complacent. But later he became worried again, because even in the "personally trained division" led by the most "excellent" cadres who had been "personally trained" by him for six months, there was "more and more camouflage."
    But even worse things were yet to come. During the Shouyang battle, under the fierce attack of our powerful People's Liberation Army, not only were his "loyal ministers and good generals" Zhang Yi and Zhao Junyi obediently taken prisoner, but those "Iron Main Beams," "Iron Secondary Beams," and "Iron Pillars" that he had painstakingly "personally trained" also threw the "instructions of His Excellency" that he had "worn his mouth out" and "said thousands of times" behind their necks. The "Iron Army" that was "unbreakable" and "indestructible" was broken and scattered with a single charge. They were so "brave and good at fighting" that they ran away like scattered sheep, each trying to save their own lives, not even bothering to fight. In the moment of crisis, none of his "superior soldiers" and "real cock cadres" could "guarantee" anything. As a result, a squad of the Liberation Army captured one mortar, two small cannons, two heavy machine gun bodies, one submachine gun, and ten rifles, without any casualties. Wang Shibao's combat team, a liberation fighter from the 2nd Company of a certain regiment, captured five light machine guns with just three people, while Cui Xu, the deputy platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 5th Company, wiped out an entire enemy platoon with just four soldiers. After five hours of pursuit, interception, and encirclement, Yan bandit's "Iron Army" was "transported" to us again with 1,215 soldiers, and "transported" various cannons, 54 grenade launchers, 101 light and heavy machine guns, and 672 long and short guns. In this way, the "personally trained Iron Army backbone" that started on January 6th still could not change his fate of being the People's Liberation Army's "recruiting station and arms transportation team," and Yan bandit's "efforts" were in vain again.

　　阎锡山的悲哀
    郭锋
    阎匪锡山感觉到他成了人民解放军的“兵役大队和枪械的运输网”，真是悲哀的很。去年十一月十五日，他在“铁军组织第八周年纪念大会”上，对他的校级以上的军官拍着桌子大叫：“如不转生，再过数年，今日我们的干部战士将尽变成杀我们的敌人！”什么是“转生”呢？就是加强他军队里的特务组织。他命令全军以师为单位调集八万八千个“铁军基干苗子”，分期传训。从里面挑选出“忠贞不二”“耻不若人”的，送到他那里，再来个“亲训”。他煞费苦的创了一套鬼名堂，把“亲训”出来的，“铁军基干”叫“铁柱子”，一个班正副班长是“铁大梁”、“铁二梁”，四个“铁柱子”，每人带两个“铁”的士兵，成为“铁”的细胞，造成“铁班的洪炉”。有了“铁班”，很快就成了“铁排”、“铁连”、“铁营”、“铁团”、“铁师”、“铁军”。成了“铁军”就能“冲不乱，打不散，攻灭敌，守歼敌。”他又以“铁柱子”是“优种军人”、“真鸡子的干部”。这位阎匪的想象力真是很丰富，他又教这群喽＠背熟些污蔑共产党的谎话，成立“说说队”，“逢人就热情的说”，“一定千遍万遍的多说”，因为他认为“迷哄人是凭的多说”。最后交给他们任务，保证班中没“伪装”。——王靖国解释“伪装”一字说“不是我们（阎匪）的人，假装成我们的人，表面上甚也一样，就是心里不一样。”照阎匪自己说，自由补的兵（抓的兵）十个就有十个是“伪装”。又教给他们一套作特务工作的技术，如“拣豆式的过滤，围攻式的约谈，轮流式的警告，钉梢式的监视”等等。这伙喽＠受训期满各回原部。阎匪非常重视他们，把他们当作他的即将倒塌的腐朽政权的最后支柱。阎匪暂编四九师三团七连代连长申建刚，代排长孟光强不知趣，对“铁军基干”郭迎山态度不好，结果都被撤了职：四连排长杨辛西队前讲话责备了“铁军基干”宋玉清，被团扣押，禁闭一星期。所以这些基干回部后，为所欲为，毫无忌惮，立刻在部队里“掀起肃伪浪潮”，造成一片恐怖空气。阎匪认为战斗成绩不错，洋洋得意起来。但后来他又发愁了，因为甚至于在那由他“亲训”出来最“优秀”的干部领导的，而又经他“亲训”了六个月的“亲训师”里，伪装却“愈肃愈多”了。
    但是更糟糕的事情还在后面呢，寿阳战斗中，他的“铁军”，在我强大的人民解放军猛烈攻击之下，不但他的“忠臣良将”张翼、赵俊义，驯服地作了俘虏，他那些苦心“亲训”成的“铁大梁”“铁二梁”和“铁柱子”也把他“磨破嘴”“千遍万遍的多说”的“钧座的训诲”扔在脖子后去了。那“冲不乱”“打不散”的“铁军”却一冲就乱了，一打就散了，他们是那么“勇敢善战”，竟象放羊似地四散奔跑，各逃活命，连枪都顾不得打了。在紧急关头，他的那些“优种军人”“真鸡子的干部”什么也不能“保证”了，于是解放军的一个班就缴获了一门迫击炮，两门小炮，两个重机枪身，一挺冲锋式和十枝步枪，而无一伤亡。某团二连解放战士王世保的战斗小组三个人缴五挺轻机，而五连一排副崔旭带着四个战士就消灭了敌人一个整排。经过五小时的追击、截击、围歼，阎匪的“铁军”就又被我们“兵运”来一千二百十五名，“枪运”来各种炮六门、掷弹筒五四具，轻重机枪一百零一挺，长短枪六七二枝。这样，从一月六日开始的“亲训铁军基干”也仍然改不了他做人民解放军“兵役大队和枪械的运输队”的命运，阎匪的“苦心”又算白费了。
