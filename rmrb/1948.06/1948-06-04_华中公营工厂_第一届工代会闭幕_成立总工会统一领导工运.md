Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st -- The first Workers' Representative Congress of the public factories under the Central China Production Management Office, which opened on May 5th, concluded on the 13th after nine days. The meeting summarized the labor movement work of the factories over the past two years and established a Trade Union Federation to unify the leadership of the labor movement in the factories in the future. The congress discussed issues related to wages and worker welfare between the trade unions and the administration. It unanimously agreed that there is no labor-capital antagonism in the public factories in the liberated areas, and factory directors and managers can participate in the trade unions. The trade unions can also appoint representatives to participate in the factory management committees to assist the administration in planning and arranging production work. Regarding the wage issue, the congress suggested that the Production Management Office should unify and adjust the wages, and all wages should be calculated by the piece, graded according to quality and savings. Regarding welfare, it stipulated preferential treatment regulations for elderly and disabled workers, and female workers would have one month of leave before and after childbirth, with appropriate care provided. Cooperatives will be established to purchase daily necessities for workers. Regarding future work, the congress decided: (1) to improve the organizational structure of the branch unions, striving to develop membership to account for more than 90% of the total number of workers; (2) to increase production and practice economy, and launch merit evaluation campaigns; (3) Under the current war situation, the branch unions should lead the workers to step up war preparedness and organize worker pickets to protect the safety of the factories.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st -- The public factories under the East China Production Management Office have persisted in developing production in the war environment for the past two years, achieving remarkable results. For example, the Xinmin Textile Factory, originally in Huaian City, transferred the entire factory in one day and one night when the enemy attacked Huai'an the year before, braving enemy aircraft bombing. Last winter, when the enemy's Fourth Reorganized Division's five regiments were stationed in Jiaoyang (newly established county between Funing and Lianshui), workers from a certain factory rushed to transport more than 2,500 bolts of cloth stored in a village three miles away from the enemy overnight. Another example is the Daming Branch Factory No. 1, which dismantled and transported machines eight times during repeated enemy sweeps. Workers carried machine parts with them so that they could quickly resume production as soon as the enemy left. Under the conditions of war and various difficulties, the workers demonstrated a high degree of initiative and improved work efficiency. The Ziji and Daming textile factories launched production competitions, increasing the amount of cloth produced per person per month from 20 to 30 bolts to 30 to 45 bolts, an increase of 50% to 75%. The Dazhong Textile Factory has already exceeded the predetermined task for half a year in the first four months of this year. The raw material consumption of the Dazhong Toothbrush Factory was reduced from 1.8% to 0.78%.

    【新华社华东一日电】华中生产管理处所属各公营工厂第一届职工代表大会五月五日开幕后，历时九日，已于十三日闭幕。会上总结两年来各厂工运工作，并成立职工总会，统一领导今后各厂工运。大会连日讨论了职工会与行政的关于工资职工福利事业诸问题，一致认为在解放区公营工厂中没有劳资对立的关系，厂长和经理均可参加职工会，职工会亦可委派代表参加工厂管理委员会，辅助行政上计划和布置生产工作。关于工资问题，大会建议生产管理处统一与调整，一律按件计资，按质量按节约分等。关于福利事业订出对年老工人残废工人的优待条例，女工产前产后各一个月休假，并予以适当照顾，举办合作社为工人采购日用必需品。关于今后工作大会决定：（一）健全各分会组织机构，向发展会员占工人总数百分之九十以上的目标努力。（二）增产节约开展评功运动。（三）在目前战争情况下，各分会领导工人加紧备战，组织工人纠察队保卫工厂安全。
    【新华社华东一日电】华东生产管理处所属各公营工厂，两年来在战争环境中坚持发展生产，成绩卓著。如原在淮安城之新民纺织厂，在前年敌进攻两淮时，冒敌机轰炸，于一日一夜间将工厂全部转移。去冬敌整四师五个团驻剿建阳（阜宁涟水间，新设县）时，某厂工人把存放于距敌三里处某庄的二千五百余匹布连夜抢运出来。又如大明一分厂，在敌人反复扫荡中，八次拆运机器。工人把机器零件带在身旁，以便敌人一去，迅速恢复生产。在战争及各种困难条件下，工人们发挥高度积极性，提高工作效率。自给及大明两纺织厂，曾开展生产竞赛，每人每月产布量由二十至三十匹，增加到三十至四十五匹，即提高百分之五十到七十五匹。大中纺织厂在今年年初四个月中，已超过了半年预定任务。大众牙刷厂的原料损耗，则由百分之一点八降低到零点七八。
