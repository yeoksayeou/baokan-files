　　Special Dispatch from this Newspaper:

　　The Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Areas have been formally merged into the North China Liberated Area. The leading Party organ formed by the merger of the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau—the CCP North China Central Bureau—was established on May 20th. The Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region have also been merged into the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, commanding the North China Field Army Corps and the vast local armed forces, fighting to eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in North China and finally liberate the entire North China region. The governments of the two regions have begun joint office operations, jointly handling the administrative affairs of North China, and will soon convene representative bodies of the people from both regions to discuss the steps and methods for complete merger.

　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army fought alone behind enemy lines. The entire North China region was divided by the enemy. The Chinese Communist Party, adapting to the objective situation at the time, created the Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Areas, centered on the north and south Taihang Mountains, in order to strengthen independent combat power and lead the Eighth Route Army and the broad masses of people, shattering countless attacks by the Japanese invaders and finally achieving final victory. After Japan surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched an anti-people civil war, entered Shijiazhuang and some areas along the Zhengtai and Pinghan lines under the cover of the Japanese invaders, implementing the Japanese-Chiang "change of guard," as a result of which the two major liberated areas remained divided. The North China People's Liberation Army has continuously achieved great victories in the people's revolutionary war, recovering lost territories along the Zhengtai and Pinghan lines, liberating Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi, and completely smashing Chiang bandit’s division, and the two major liberated areas have been completely connected into one. From now on, in order to concentrate forces even more effectively, unify steps, develop production, intensify construction, and complete the task of supporting the front lines and striving for victory, it has been decided to merge the two major liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area. The leaders of the North China Bureau firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, relying on the high awareness of the people of North China and the abundant human and material resources of the North China Liberated Area, as long as they do not make mistakes or make fewer mistakes, they will definitely be able to complete the tasks of production, Party rectification, political construction, supporting the front, and eliminating the remaining enemies within the territory, thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the reactionary forces of Yan Xishan and Fu Zuoyi, and further build a new democratic North China.

　　晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两大解放区合并
  　华北解放区正式组成
    【本报特讯】晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区已正式合并为华北解放区。由中共晋察冀中央局和晋冀鲁豫中央局合并成立的党的领导机关——中共华北中央局，已于五月二十日成立。晋察冀军区和晋冀鲁豫军区亦已合并为中国人民解放军华北军区，统率华北各野战兵团和广大地方武装，为肃清蒋介石匪帮在华北的残余势力，最后解放整个华北而战。两区政府已联合办公，共同处理华北的行政事务，并即将召集两区人民代表机关，商讨完全合并的步骤和方法。
    在抗日战争期间，八路军在敌后孤军奋战，整个华北被敌分割，中国共产党适应当时客观形势的需要，为了加强独立作战的力量，领导八路军及广大人民，以南北太行为中心，创建晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区，粉碎日寇无数次进攻，终于取得最后胜利。日本投降后，蒋介石匪帮发动反人民内战，在日寇掩护之下，进入石家庄及正太、平汉两线若干地区，实行了日蒋“换防”，因之两大解放区依然处在被分割状态。华北人民解放军在人民革命战争中不断获得伟大胜利，收复正太、平汉两线失地，解放石家庄、元氏，彻底粉碎了蒋匪的分割，两大解放区乃完全联成一片。今后为了更能集中力量，齐一步伐，发展生产、加紧建设，以完成支援前线争取胜利的任务、特决定两大解放区合并为华北解放区。华北局领导者们坚决相信：在中共中央和毛主席正确领导下，依靠华北人民的高度觉悟和华北解放区丰富的人力物力，只要自己不犯错误或少犯错误，一定能够完成生产、整党、建政、支前、肃清境内残余敌人的任务。彻底干净消灭蒋介石匪帮及阎匪锡山、傅匪作义等反动势力，进一步建设新民主主义的华北。
