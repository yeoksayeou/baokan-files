Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. The patriotic movement of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against the American support of Japanese aggression and the threat to China is expanding daily. According to an Associated Press report, students at Hujiang University, sponsored by the American Church in Shanghai, announced a one-day hunger strike on the 10th to protest the American policy of supporting Japan. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 10th, students from various schools in Fuzhou have decided to organize a movement to boycott Japanese goods and take unified protest actions against the American policy of reviving Japanese militarism. Fourteen university professors in Shanghai published an open letter to Stuart, accusing him of threatening Chinese students in his statement, and listing powerful facts such as MacArthur's expansion of Japanese naval bases in Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Kure, the return of twenty-eight warships and submarines originally designated for reparations to Japan, the preservation of all Japanese aviation equipment and underground factories, the construction of a giant air force base in Aomori, and the sending of former Japanese "Kamikaze" suicide pilots to the United States for training, refuting Stuart's shameless statement denying the restoration of Japanese warlord forces. The letter stated that the Chinese people do not want to see Japan, with American support, revive its economic imperialism and control of the Far Eastern market, and pointed out that the American policy of supporting Japan is seriously threatening the safety of China and the world. At the same time, the editors of ten publications in Shanghai jointly issued an open letter, believing that Stuart's statement "full of intimidation" has aroused "extremely strong resentment from the Chinese people." The open letter accused the United States of helping Japan revive its potential for aggression economically and militarily, and stated, "We are willing and always ready to be friends with the American people, but we refuse to live a slave life under foreign oppression and trampling."

    【新华社陕北十四日电】蒋管区人民反对美国扶植日本侵略势力，威胁中国的爱国运动，正在日益扩大。据美联社消息，上海美国教会主办的沪江大学学生，为抗议美国扶日政策，于十日宣布绝食一天。另据路透社十日沪电，福州各校学生已决定组织抵制日货运动，并对美国复活日本黩武主义的政策，采取一致抗议行动。上海十四位大学教授发表致司徒雷登公开信，指责其在声明中威胁中国学生，并列举麦克阿瑟扩大日本横须贺·佐世保·吴港等海军基地，将原来指定作赔偿用的二十八艘军舰、潜艇交还日本，保持日本一切航空设备、地下工厂、在青森修筑巨型空军机场，及将前日本“神风”自杀航空队员送往美国受训等有力事实，驳斥司徒否认恢复日本军阀势力的无耻声明。信中表示中国人民不愿重见日本在美国扶助下，复活其经济帝国主义与控制远东市场，并指出美国扶日政策正严重的威胁着中国与世界的安全。与此同时，上海十个刊物的编辑亦联名发出公开信，认为司徒“充满恫吓”的声明，已激起“全中国人民极强烈的反感”。公开信指责美国正从经济上及军事上帮助日本侵略潜力的复活，并表示“我们愿意并且随时准备与美国人民成为友人，但我们拒绝在外国压迫蹂躏下过奴隶生活”。
