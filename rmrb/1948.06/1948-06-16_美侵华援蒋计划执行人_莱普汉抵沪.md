Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Rappehan, the chief executive officer and representative in China of the American "Economic Cooperation Administration," who serves as the general supervisor of the US imperialist Aid-Chiang plan, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, accompanied by Stillman, the head of the "Technical Survey Team" dispatched to China by the Bureau, and others. A communique issued by the American Embassy in Nanjing on the 9th declared that Rappehan had decided to establish his delegation's headquarters in Nanjing, with an office in Shanghai. As for the specific tasks of the "Technical Survey Team," according to public announcements from the American side, they involve investigating the Shanghai power plant, the Aohan Railway, the two coal mines in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, and Xiangtan, Hunan, as well as port facilities in the Chiang-controlled areas. A Central News Agency dispatch from New York on May 8th stated that the team's technicians would join Chiang's technicians to "investigate the economy and resources of (Chiang's) various regions." Many of the team's personnel are direct agents of American monopoly capital. For example, Stillman is a director of Pacific Printing Company of Los Angeles and former chairman of the board of Mans Coast Paper Mill; electrical engineer Wittemore is the vice chairman of Chase Bank; and mining engineer Bolick is the former general manager of Pittsburgh Holier Coal Company.
