　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian National Assembly deputies unanimously passed the nationalization law of industry, mining, banking, insurance, and transportation on the 11th. The original proposer, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet and General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party (i.e., the unified party after the merger of the Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party), Dej, emphasized in his speech the great significance of this law for further developing the economy and consolidating the national independence of the Romanian People's Republic. In their speeches, not only did the representatives of the Workers' Party, the Farmers' Front, the People's National Party, the Farmers' Democratic Party, and the Hungarian People's League (representing the Hungarian minority in Romania) unanimously urge the passage of this bill, but even the representatives of the opposition National Liberal Party expressed their support. Factories and institutions throughout Romania held meetings to celebrate after learning that the parliament had passed the nationalization law.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS dispatch: The Soviet government, at the request of the Romanian and Hungarian governments, has decided to reduce the remaining 50% of the reparations owed by Romania and Hungary to the Soviet Union, starting from July 1st. In its replies to the Romanian and Hungarian governments on the 7th, the Soviet government pointed out that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the request to reduce reparations is to satisfy the wishes of these countries to strive for the restoration and development of their national economies. The Moscow News published an editorial on the 9th on this decision of the Soviet government, stating that this action by the Soviet government is extremely important because it is not only a new expression of the Soviet Union's willingness to help friendly countries in their economic recovery and development, but also because Romania and Hungary are no longer the former satellite states of Germany but independent, peace-loving nations. The economic assistance provided by the Soviet Union helps to strengthen the national independence of these countries and establish democratic international cooperation, which is a valuable contribution to consolidating universal peace and international security.

　　罗马尼亚国民议会
  　通过工业国有化法案
  　苏联减少罗匈战费赔偿
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚国民议会议员，于十一日一致通过工业、矿业、银行、保险和运输事业国有化法案。原提案人内阁第一副总理、罗马尼亚工人党（按即罗国的共产党与社会民主党合并以后的统一政党）总书记德治，在演说中着重指出，这一法案对进一步发展经济和巩固罗马尼亚人民共和国国家独立的重大意义。在发言中，不仅工人党、农民阵线、人民国家党、农民民主党与匈牙利人民联盟（代表罗国匈牙利少数民族）的代表一致敦促通过本法案，甚至反对派的国民自由党的代表也表示拥护。全罗各地工厂机关在得悉议会通过国有化法案后纷纷开会庆祝。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联政府已应罗马尼亚与匈牙利政府之请，决定自七月一日起减少罗、匈两国对苏赔偿余额的百分之五十。苏政府于七日在分致罗、匈政府的复文中指出：苏联之接受减少赔偿的请求，是为了满足各该国努力恢复和发展国民经济的愿望。莫斯科消息报于九日对苏联政府这一决定发表社论称：苏联政府这一行动极端重要，因为这不仅是苏联愿意帮助友好各国经济恢复和发展的新表示。同时也因为罗、匈两国现在已不再是从前德国的卫星国而是爱好和平的独立国家。苏联给予的经济援助有助于加强各该国的国家独立与建立民主的国际合作，这是对巩固普遍和平与国际安全的有价值的贡献。
