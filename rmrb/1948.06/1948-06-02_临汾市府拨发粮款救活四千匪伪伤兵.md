　　Linfen Municipal Government Allocates Grain and Funds to Save Four Thousand Bandit-Puppet Wounded Soldiers
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the Jinan Front, 29th] More than four thousand wounded soldiers abandoned by the Chiang-Hu bandit troops in the "July 7th" Rear Hospital of the Bandit-Puppet Ministry of National Defense Joint Logistics Headquarters and the field hospitals of the Chiang bandit 30th Brigade and the Yan bandit 66th Division have been given relief with grain and funds allocated by our democratic government. Personnel have also been dispatched to cooperate with the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army to organize three medical stations to change their dressings and treat their illnesses. As for the wounded soldiers left by the bandit troops on various positions, the municipal government also sent people to carry them out of the bunkers and send them to the hospital for treatment. As for the wounded soldiers who had already died, the democratic municipal government gave them burial. When the bandit wounded soldiers saw the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army caring for them so much, they were all grateful and recounted the suffering of the wounded soldiers under the rule of Chiang and Yan. Wang Guocai, a second-class soldier of the 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, 18th Regiment of the Bandit 30th Brigade, tearfully told reporters: "I was wounded three times on the eastern city position, but the officers would not let me leave the front line. The fourth time my leg was broken, I was sent to the hospital. After arriving at the hospital, the director deducted military pay, and the wounded soldiers could not get enough to eat all day long. When someone raised an objection, the director said that these people were all 'pretenders,' and once he buried eight people alive." Huo Guangcai, a second-class soldier of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 197th Regiment of the Yan bandit 66th Division, also added: "They (referring to the bandit troops) constantly forced lightly wounded soldiers from the hospital to return to the front line in order to replenish the shortage of soldiers. Whoever was unwilling to go would be called a 'pretender,' expelled from the hospital, and left with no place to go, starving to death." When reporters asked about their feelings after the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they said: "Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan killed us; the People's Liberation Army rescued us from the fire pit. We will never forget this kindness." For some wounded soldiers who wished to return home, the democratic municipal government issued travel expenses and passports to send them back to their hometowns. (Li Zemin)

　　临汾市府拨发粮款救活四千匪伪伤兵
    【本报晋南前线二十九日电】被蒋胡匪军遗弃在临汾匪伪国防部联勤总部“七七”后方医院及蒋匪三十旅野战医院、阎匪六十六师野战医院内的伤兵四千多名，已由我民主政府拨发粮款，施以救济；并派员协同解放军之医务人员组织三个医疗所，给他们换药治病。匪军遗留在各个阵地上之彩号，市府亦派人把他们从碉堡里抬出来，送到医院里去治病。至于原来已死去的伤兵，民主市府则给以掩埋。匪军伤兵人员见了民主政府及解放军对他们如此关怀，莫不感激，纷纷痛述在蒋阎统治之下伤兵之苦难。匪三十旅十八团二营五连二等兵王国才痛哭流涕的对记者说：“我在城东阵地上连挂过三次彩，当官的也不让下火线，第四次把腿打断了才把我送到医院。来到医院后，院长克扣军饷，伤兵终日不得一饱，有人提了意见，院长就说这些人都是‘伪装分子’，有一次就活埋了八个人。”阎匪六十六师一九七团三营七连二等兵霍广才也补充着说：“他们（指匪军）为补充兵源缺乏，还不断的从医院内强迫抽调轻伤员重上火线，谁不愿去就说你是‘伪装分子’，被开除出医院，从此没着落，困饿而死。”当记者问到解放军进城之后他们的感想时，他们说：“蒋介石、阎锡山害死了我们；解放军把我们从火坑里救出来，这种恩德，我们永世不忘。”一部伤员愿回家的，民主市府即发给路费、护照，遣送他们回籍。（李泽民）
