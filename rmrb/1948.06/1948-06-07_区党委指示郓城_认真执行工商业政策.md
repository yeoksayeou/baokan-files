　　[Ji Lu Yu News] The Henan General Branch reports: Tongchun Vegetable Shop in the Southwest Village of the Second District of Yuncheng was struggled against and fined 120 silver dollars last autumn. This spring, poor peasants, due to lack of food, demanded that the money be distributed. At that time, the district was afraid to make a decision, so it asked the county committee for instructions. The county committee decided to allow the poor peasants to divide the money, so it notified the district, and the district notified the village to implement the county committee's decision. From this, it can be seen that the county committee did not seriously study and implement the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting policies and correcting left-leaning adventurism. The district party committee has instructed them to correct it immediately, and hopes that the county committee will conduct a good check.

　　区党委指示郓城
  　认真执行工商业政策
    【冀鲁豫消息】河南总支社报导：郓城二区西南村同春菜铺于去年秋天被斗，罚了一百廿块现洋，今春贫农因没啥吃，要求把钱分了。当时区里不敢作主，便向县委会请示，县委会确定允许贫农分了，于是便通知该区，该区又通知该村，把县委会决议贯彻下去。由此可见，该县委会对中央局端正政策，纠正左倾冒险主义的指示，未加认真研究和执行。区党委已指示他们立即纠正，尚望该县委好好进行检查。
