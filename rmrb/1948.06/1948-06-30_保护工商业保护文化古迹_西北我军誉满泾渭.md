Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: In the Jing and Wei River region of Shaanxi, various schools, cultural heritage sites, and young students have received the close protection of the People's Liberation Army during the war. After liberating Lingtai on April 22nd, teachers from Lingtai Middle School and Zhongshan Elementary School had been forcibly taken away by the puppet County Magistrate Zhao Zhumin, and all the students were scattered and returned home. The school's property was scattered and unattended. The People's Liberation Army immediately dispatched a work team to the school to gather the scattered property into storage rooms, seal them, and assign soldiers to guard them, ensuring that the books, instruments, and all public property of the two schools were not lost. The county's People's Education Center was also similarly protected. The Lingtai Pavilion in Lingtai Park was built in the Sui Dynasty, and contains inscriptions by famous figures from past dynasties, and the Fanghe Pavilion on the side of the terrace has beautiful scenery. The People's Liberation Army protected the statues, antiques, flowers, plants, and trees in the park, and prohibited anyone from destroying them. During the battle for @ County, the enemy retreated to the mountain behind the @ County Middle School dormitory and stubbornly resisted, and the battle was extremely fierce. In order to protect the safety of the students of the school, the People's Liberation Army specially dispatched soldiers to the school to take more than 70 students to a safe area. During the transfer, the enemy opened fire, wounding several students. The People's Liberation Army immediately sent doctors to treat them and carried them home. As soon as the battle ended, the City Work Committee of the People's Liberation Army posted notices of "Protect the School" at the school and Shaanxi Provincial @ County Normal School, and sent representatives to the two schools to express their sympathy. After conquering Changning Town in Yongshou County, in addition to returning the things that had been seized by the Jiang enemy and the puppets, they also gave each student of the school a blanket and a cotton vest captured from the enemy. The Young Army soldiers of the defending enemy who were annihilated in Changning were given great care because most of them were students who had been deceived into working for Chiang Kai-shek. Those who had died were properly buried, and those who were seriously injured were rescued as long as they had a little breath. Captain Liu, the leader of a work team accompanying a certain unit, personally cared for a seriously injured Young Army soldier who was unconscious. When the wounded soldier regained consciousness, he gratefully said to Liu: "The People's Liberation Army is my own father, and you are my older brother." The People's Liberation Army gave all the wounded Young Army soldiers money for their recovery. When receiving the money, the lightly wounded stood up to salute, and the seriously wounded waved their hands to express their gratitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army strictly implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce during its advance into the Jing and Wei River region of central Shaanxi, winning the heartfelt support of people in the industrial and commercial sectors. On April 25th, when our army advanced to Shilipu in Baoji, it immediately sent a company to protect the Shenxin No. 4 Factory, ensuring that the factory's raw materials and machinery were not damaged. The factory was run by Rong Desheng, a Chinese national capitalist, and has five branches: power, flour, textile, and papermaking, making it one of the largest industries in the Northwest. When our army liberated Baoji on April 27th, the Shenxin Office at No. 2 Wufuxiang, West Street, was also similarly protected. When our army entered Baoji, the propagandists were surrounded by groups of merchants. One propagandist asked the surrounding merchants: "Did you see our people enter the Lao Fengxiang Gold Store?" Everyone said in unison: "No!" He asked again: "Did anyone smash the door?" The owner of Lao Fengxiang Gold Store replied: "No, comrades! You are telling the truth about protecting industry and commerce." After the battle, the Baoji Democratic Government completely returned the two trainloads of goods that had been seized to their original owners, of which the various goods received by 14 merchants were worth 3.5 billion and 5.5 million yuan in Chiang currency. A member of a certain grain store happily told others: "Not a single one of our 172 bags of goods was missing." And thanked our army, saying: "We merchants welcome you with both hands to manage the country." When our army personnel asked him, how was the Kuomintang government here? He said humorously: "There was a lot of construction, and there were nearly 70 brothels alone." On April 21st, our army liberated Changwu. The next day, the Northwest Farmers' Bank (the bank of the Northwest Liberated Area) exchange office was established in Xiguan, allowing merchants to exchange Chiang currency for agricultural currency at a certain ratio, which quickly invigorated market transactions. Many People's Liberation Army soldiers bought paper and pens, and the business of the owner of a stationery store in Xiguan was particularly prosperous. He said: "Two days of business is more than the past three months." @Yi was liberated for the second time, so it was not unfamiliar to our army. As soon as the battle was over, the shops immediately opened. Yongxingyuan's transaction was worth 12 million yuan in Chiang currency in one day. Before the liberation of Lingtai, the puppet County Magistrate Zhao Zhumin had carried out extensive deceptive propaganda, causing some merchants to misunderstand and fear our army. When our army entered the city, it was not yet dawn, and the residents were not disturbed at all. When it dawned, it was still quiet as usual. So some merchants came out to see, and our army personnel immediately carried out propaganda and explanation, wrote slogans, and posted the People's Liberation Army's declaration. By breakfast time, 16 merchants had opened their doors, and by the afternoon, the number of businesses open had increased to 37, accounting for more than half of the 70 businesses in the city.

　　保护工商业保护文化古迹
  　西北我军誉满泾渭
    【新华社西北二十七日电】陕西泾渭地区各学校、文化古迹及青年学生等，在战争中受到解放军严密保护。四月廿二日解放灵台后，灵台中学及中山小学两校教员已为伪县长赵铸民强迫带走，学生全部失散回家，校内物资散乱，无人料理。解放军立即派工作队前往该校，将丢散物资集中储藏室，加封上锁，并且派兵守护，使该两校图书仪器及一切公物没有散失，该县民教馆亦受到同样保护。灵台公园内之灵台建于隋朝，上有历代名人题字，台侧之放鹤亭风景甚佳。解放军对园内神像古物花草林木均加保护，禁止任何人来此捣毁。解放＠县战斗中，敌人退到＠县中学宿舍后面山上顽抗，战斗异常激烈。解放军为保护该校学生安全，特派战士到该校将七十多个学生带向安全地区，转移途中，敌竟开枪射击，学生数名被击伤，解放军立即又派医生为其治疗，并抬送回家。战斗一结束，解放军城市工作委员会又在该校及陕西省立＠县师范两校张贴“保护学校”的字条，并派代表赴两校慰问。攻克永寿县常宁镇后，除蒋敌伪霸占学校东西发还外，并将缴获的敌人被毯、棉背心各一部送给该校同学。对常宁被歼之守敌青年军士兵，因其多系学生出身，被骗替蒋介石卖命，故予以极大关怀，已死者妥为埋葬，重伤者只要有一点气息，即予救护。某部随军工作队刘队长亲自看护一个昏迷不醒的重伤青年军士兵，当伤员清醒了时，对刘感激的说：“解放军是我的亲爹，你就是我的大哥。”对所有受了伤的青年军士兵，解放军都给他们发了养伤费，在收费时轻伤者都起立致敬，重伤者则摆手表示感激。
    【新华社西北二十七日电】西北人民解放军在挺进陕西中部泾渭地区作战时，严格执行保护工商业政策，获得工商界人士衷心拥护。四月二十五日，我军进至宝鸡十里铺时，即派一个连保护申新第四厂，使该厂原料、机器毫无损坏。该厂为中国民族资本家荣德生氏所办，下分电力、面粉、纺织、造纸等五个分厂，为西北规模最大的工业之一。四月二十七日我军解放宝鸡时，对西大街五幅巷二号申新办事处亦同样予以保护。我军进入宝鸡，宣传员都被成群商民包围起来。一个宣传员向周围的商民问道：“你们看见我们的人进老凤祥金店没有？”大家齐声说“没有！”又问：“有人打门没有？”老凤祥金店主人回答：“没有，同志！你们保护工商业都是实话。”战斗结束后，宝鸡民主政府将缴获的两列车货物完全发还原主，其中十四家商号领回的各种货物值蒋币三十五亿零五百五十万元。某粮食行的人员高兴的向别人宣传：“我们一百七十二包货物一点也没有短少。”并向我军致谢说：“你们管理国家，我们商人双手欢迎。”我军人员问起他，蒋介石政府在这里怎么样？他幽默地说：“建设很多，光妓院就近七十家。”四月廿一日我军解放长武，次日，西北农民银行（西北解放区的银行）兑换所即在西关建立，准许商民以一定比价用蒋币兑换农币，使市场交易迅速活跃。解放军战士买纸买笔者很多，西关某文具店老板生意特别兴隆，他说：“两天买卖比以往三个月还多。”＠邑这次是第二次解放，故对我军毫不生疏，战事一完，商店立即开门。永兴源一天交易就值蒋币一千二百万元。灵台解放前，伪县长赵铸民曾大肆进行欺骗宣传，致有部分商民对我军有误解疑惧。我军进入该城时，天还未亮，对居民丝毫未加惊动，到天亮仍安静如常。于是有些商民出来探望，我军人员立即展开宣传解释，书写标语、张贴解放军宣言，至早饭后即有十六家商号开门，到下午，开门营业者已增至三十七家，占全城商户七十家的一半以上。
