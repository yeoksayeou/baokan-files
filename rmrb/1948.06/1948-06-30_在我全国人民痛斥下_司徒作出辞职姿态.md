　　Under Condemnation from the People of the Whole Country,
  　Stuart Made a Gesture of Resignation
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】After Stuart’s sophistry on the U.S. policy of supporting Japan was universally condemned, he had no choice but to use "offering his resignation" to appease the anger of the Chinese people. According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 24th, Stuart was forced to admit in front of Yenching University students on the 23rd that "there may have been some errors in the implementation steps and methods" of the U.S. policy toward Japan. According to reports from United Press and Associated Press, Stuart made a gesture of resignation under this predicament. Stuart told a United Press reporter on the 24th that he had submitted his resignation to Secretary of State Marshall, and if accepted, he would return to his position as President of Yenching University. When reporting this, the Associated Press recalled that Stuart "had been severely criticized by students across the country," including teachers and students of Yenching University, after issuing a statement on June 4. Stuart flew to Beiping from Nanjing on the 23rd, specifically to spend his sixty-second birthday at Yenching University. However, United Press reported that Stuart was met with a cold reception from the students at the school. A Yenching University spokesperson said that the students had not planned any welcome parties or celebrations for his sixty-second birthday.

　　在我全国人民痛斥下
  　司徒作出辞职姿态
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】司徒雷登在其对美国扶日政策的诡辩遭受普遍斥责后，不得不以“提出辞职”来缓和中国人民的愤怒。据合众社北平二十四日电称：司徒二十三日在燕大学生面前被迫承认美国在对日政策的“执行步骤与方法上，可能有若干错误”。据合众社和美联社报导，司徒处此窘境，乃作出辞职的姿态。司徒雷登廿四日告合众社记者称：他已向国务卿马歇尔提出辞呈，如被接受，他将返任燕大校长。美联社报导此事时，追述司徒于六月四日发表声明后“曾受全国学生严厉抨击”，包括燕大师生在内。司徒系于二十三日自南京飞抵北平，专为到燕大度其六十二岁寿辰。但合众社称：司徒在该校受到学生的冷遇。燕大发言人说：学生们并未为他策划任何欢迎会或庆祝他的六十二岁寿辰。
