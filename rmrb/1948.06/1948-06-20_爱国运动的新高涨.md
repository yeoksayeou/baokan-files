　　The long-standing anger of the Chinese people towards the US reactionaries' support for Japanese aggression has erupted on a large scale in the recent student demonstrations in Shanghai and Peiping, and in student movements in other major cities in the KMT-controlled areas. At the same time, prominent figures from industry, commerce, culture, and education in Shanghai, Peiping, Hong Kong, and other places have successively issued protests against the US pro-Japanese policy. Not only all democrats, but also many traditionally conservative opinion organs and political figures, and even some KMT-affiliated opinion organs and political figures, have had to express dissent – or at least express it verbally – towards the blatant pro-Japanese policy of the US reactionaries. On the contrary, the US Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued a written statement directly interfering in China's internal affairs, trotting out the fascist "anti-communist" theory to defend the US government's reactionary policies, and threatening the Chinese people's protest movement by saying: "If it continues, it may lead to unfortunate consequences." Chiang Kai-shek's military police, secret agents, and other organs immediately obediently carried out Stuart's sinister orders, frantically suppressing, arresting, and injuring patriotic students. Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organ, the Central Daily News, also made every effort to prove that they are filial and loyal subjects of the American aggressors and the Japanese aggressors. In addition to reciting the propaganda outlines issued by the US Embassy, they also put forward more sinister and straightforward slogans, advocating "surgical cutting" and "uprooting" the patriotic movement. But despite all this, the fearless patriotic movement of the students and people in the KMT-controlled areas continues to advance. On the one hand, foreign aggressors and traitors stand together, revealing their true colors, both sinister and isolated; on the other hand, all Chinese people with patriotic hearts stand together, filled with righteous indignation, persecuted but believing that they will surely be victorious: this is the basic situation in this struggle.
　　The persecution suffered by the Chinese people under Chiang Kai-shek's rule in the past two years has been appalling, but even more astonishing is that the people have not been subdued, but have become even stronger. The student movement is a prominent example. Everyone knows that the situation of students in the KMT-controlled areas today is far more dangerous than during the "May Fourth," "May 30th," and "December 9th" periods; however, their struggle, in terms of awareness, organization, courage, resourcefulness, and perseverance, is far beyond any previous level. This fact is, on the one hand, because Chiang Kai-shek's oppression and US imperialism's aggression have forced the Chinese people to unite and fight, leaving them with no other choice. And the students in the KMT-controlled areas have always been at the forefront of the people in the KMT-controlled areas in various resistance movements. Their revolutionary demands, after a long period of suffering and training, have become increasingly mature with the maturation of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. On the other hand, the great victories of the People's Liberation Army throughout the country, and Chiang Kai-shek's fatal military defeat, have greatly encouraged the courage of the people, especially the students, in the KMT-controlled areas to fight. There have also been such dark periods in history when not only the middle class but also the lower classes temporarily succumbed to the tyranny of certain despots. But that is not today. In today's China, not only the lower classes have shown unparalleled courage and self-sacrifice because victory is in sight, but also a fairly large middle class has shown similar confidence and courage. When students wage a struggle against hunger and oppression, they see a future of warmth, food, and freedom; similarly, when they denounce the US reactionaries for supporting Japan's aggression against China, they know that this denunciation is not in vain, and that this denunciation will accelerate the birth of an independent New China. Therefore, they not only extremely hate the sinister and shamelessness of the oppressors, aggressors, and their lackeys, but also extremely despise them, because no matter how rampant these reactionaries are for a time and in a place, they are ultimately reactionaries who are about to perish. This universal confidence proves that the revolutionary upsurge not only exists in the liberated areas, but also exists among the people in the KMT-controlled areas at the same time. This is a symbol of the approaching victory of the revolution.
　　In this solemn protest by the Chinese people against the reactionary US policy, Stuart and the Chiang Kai-shek government have tried their best to show their ferocity in an attempt to scare the students and the people away. But what have they gained? They can see that the Chinese people's response is not trembling, fear, and retreat, but greater anger, more bitter ridicule, and a deeper and broader movement. Stuart attempted to defend the indefensible US policy towards Japan in front of the Chinese people, showing that he is not only reactionary, but also stupid. Because of this, this gold-dollar ambassador has been unanimously cursed by the entire Chinese people. The faculty and students of Yenching University, which Stuart has long considered his political capital, refuted his fallacies face to face this time; even the Ta Kung Pao, which is touting Stuart-style "liberalism," could not help but complain about Stuart's absurd actions. As for the Chiang Kai-shek clique, they also came out to defend the United States, which shows that they are even more reactionary and even more stupid. When the KMT reactionaries were busy prohibiting "opposing the US support for Japan," they actually forgot that not many days ago, in order to bargain with Washington and to appease the public outrage of the people across the country, they themselves had pretended to "oppose" the US support for Japan on certain occasions. For example, on January 27 this year, a United Press dispatch from Nanjing stated: "Authoritative sources representing the government told United Press reporters that the Chinese government is strongly opposed to the US plan to revive Japanese industry and the economy. ... The US action to support Japan has apparently jeopardized the possibility of a Sino-US compromise. ... The Chinese government believes that it is absolutely impossible to make Japan strong without engaging in aggression." Although the KMT subsequently "changed" its diplomacy, the KMT's "public opinion" did not have time to "change" in the same way. Only a month ago, the so-called "National Federation of Trade Unions," which was solely organized by the Nanjing KMT, "raised a serious protest against MacArthur's policy of supporting Japan"; and as late as June 1, the KMT's so-called "legislators" were still demanding that "the government take urgent measures to prevent all actions that would boost Japan's military and economic power." But by the morning of the next day, June 2, all propaganda about "US support for Japan" was suddenly declared to be "Communist military spies and professional students instigating anti-American movements"! This confusion and contradiction in the propaganda of the KMT reactionaries proves how panicked and helpless these traitors are in the face of the great and completely just people's movement!
　　The KMT reactionaries proudly created the term "Communist military spies and professional students" to slander and intimidate the patriotic student movement. But the reactionaries have once again revealed their true colors here. As the Associated Press Shanghai dispatch of the 5th stated, patriotic students appeal to reason, while the "opposition students" directed by the reactionaries – "including right-wing 'professionals' who often carry weapons – respond with fist fights." Everyone knows that only the KMT reactionaries, who are at the end of their rope, raise a group of "professional students" who do not study and specialize in "carrying weapons" and "fist fights" in order to undermine the people's resistance movement. Indeed, if they do not repent in time, they will not only degenerate into Chiang Kai-shek's "military spies," but also degenerate into the "military spies" of the American aggressors. Just like the KMT reactionaries, Stuart, the US ambassador, also uses "conspiracy" to slander the heroic Chinese patriots. But everyone knows that it is those fascist "anti-communist" disciples, those foreign colonialists who directly interfere in the on-campus activities of Chinese students, and those foreign commanders of the "military spies" of the Chinese secret service, who are the despicable and barbaric conspirators. As for the broad masses of patriotic students, no matter how the KMT reactionaries and the like of Stuart slander and intimidate them, justice is in the hearts of the people. The Shanghai middle-class publication "Observation" wrote: "Students have become the spokespersons for the interests of the people. ... The content they are fighting for is not limited to their own rights, and their cries have become a 'voice of the times.' ... They have shown amazing achievements in their analysis of reality, their pursuit of ideals, their ability to do things, and their spirit of struggle; they have implicitly become a giant wheel driving the times." This fact, this public opinion, cannot be erased or changed by any slander or intimidation from any reactionaries. In fact, every time the Chinese and American reactionaries carry out oppression against the Chinese people's patriotic and democratic movement, they increase their own isolation, which has become a law. As before, in this patriotic movement against the US pro-Japanese policy, Stuart and the Chiang Kai-shek government have once again lost their prestige; and the patriotic students and people will unite and move forward more resolutely until their struggle is victorious. The light belongs to the students, to the people.

### 爱国运动的新高涨

　　爱国运动的新高涨
    中国人民对于美国反动派扶植日本侵略势力的长久愤怒，在最近上海和北平的学生大示威中，在蒋管区其他大城市的学生运动中，大规模地爆发出来了。与此同时，上海北平香港等地工商文化教育界名流接连地发出对于美国扶日政策的抗议。不但一切民主分子，而且许多素来倾向保守的舆论机关和政治人物，甚至包括某些属于国民党的舆论机关和政治人物在内，对于美国反动派明目张胆的扶日政策，也不得不表示异议——至少是不得不在口头上表示异议。在相反的方面，则有美国驻华大使司徒雷登发表直接干涉中国内政的书面声明，搬出法西斯的“防共”理论来辩护美国政府的反动政策，并威吓中国人民的抗议运动说：“倘仍继续进行，可能招致不幸结果”。蒋介石的军警宪特机关，立即驯服地执行了司徒的凶恶号令，疯狂地压迫、逮捕并打伤了爱国的学生。蒋介石的宣传机关中央日报，也竭力证明它们是美国侵略者和日本侵略者的孝子忠臣，它们除了背诵美国大使馆所颁发的宣传提纲以外，还提出了更凶恶而直截了当的口号，鼓吹对爱国运动“操刀一割，斩草除根”。但是不顾这一切，大无畏的蒋管区学生和人民的爱国运动，还是继续前进。一方面，是外国侵略者和卖国贼站在一起，原形毕露，既凶恶而又孤立；另一方面，是全中国一切有爱国心的人民站在一起，义愤填膺，受着迫害但是相信自己一定能够胜利：——这就是这次斗争中的基本形势。
    蒋介石统治下的中国人民，两年来所受的迫害是惊人的，但更惊人的，是人民并没有被压服，而是更坚强了。学生运动就是一个显著的例子。谁都知道，今天蒋管区学生处境之险恶，远甚于过去的“五四”、“五卅”、“一二九”时期；然而他们的奋斗，就其觉悟性，组织性，勇敢、机智和坚持性来看，却在在都远到了空前的水平。这个事实，一方面，是因为蒋介石的压迫和美帝国主义的侵略，逼得中国人民除开团结起来奋斗而外，就没有其他道路可走。而蒋管区的学生则在历次的反抗运动中，都是站在蒋管区人民的最前列。他们的革命要求，经过长时期的熬煎和锻炼，已经随着中国人民的革命运动的成熟而日趋成熟。另一方面，又因为人民解放军在全国范围内的伟大的胜利，和蒋介石在军事上的致命的失败，极大地鼓励了蒋管区人民首先是蒋管区学生的斗争的勇气。历史上也有过这样的黑暗时期，那时，不但中层人民，而且下层人民也暂时屈服于某些暴君的淫威之下。但是那不是今天。在今天的中国，不但下层人民因为胜利在望而表现了无比的勇敢和自我牺牲，而且颇为广大的中间阶层，也表现了类似的信心和勇气。当学生举行反饥饿反压迫的斗争时，他们在面前是看到了一个温饱和自由的未来；同样地，当他们控诉美国反动派的扶日侵华时，他们知道，这个控诉也不是徒然的，这个控诉将要加速一个独立的新中国的诞生。因此，他们不但极端地仇视压迫者、侵略者及其走狗的种种凶恶无耻，而且极端地藐视他们，因为无论这些反动派怎样猖狂于一时一地，他们究竟是即将灭亡的反动派。这个普遍的信心，证明革命高潮不独是在解放区存在，即在蒋管区人民中也同时存在。这正是革命临近胜利的象征。
    在这一次中国人民对于美国反动政策的严正抗议中，司徒雷登和蒋介石政府都竭力露出他们的凶相，企图把学生和人民吓退。但是他们收获了什么呢？他们可以看到：中国人民的反应，并不是战栗、恐惧和后退，而是更大的愤怒，更辛辣的嘲笑，和运动的更加深入与扩大。司徒雷登企图在中国人民面前辩护无法辩护的美国对日政策，表示他不但反动，并且愚蠢。正因为这样，这个金元大使受了全中国人民的一致唾骂。司徒长期认为政治资本的燕京大学的师生，这次面对面地驳斥了他的谬论；甚至正在标榜司徒式“自由主义”的大公报，也不得不对司徒这个荒谬的行动发出怨言。至于蒋介石集团也跟着出来替美国辩护，则表示他们是更加反动和更加愚蠢。当国民党反动派忙于禁止“反对美国扶助日本”的时候，居然忘记了不多几天以前，他们为了与华盛顿讨价还价，为了敷衍全国人民的公愤，自己也曾在某些场合装腔作势地“反对”美国扶助日本。例如今年一月二十七日南京合众社电：“代表政府的权威人士告合众社记者称：中国政府竭力反对美国复兴日本工业与经济的计划。……美国扶植日本的行动，显然已危害中美妥协的可能性。……中国政府认为欲使日本强大后而不从事侵略，乃绝对不可能之事。”尽管国民党在外交上随后就“转变”了，但是国民党的“舆论”却还来不及同样“转变”。仅仅在一个月以前，南京国民党一手包办的所谓“全国总工会”，就还“对麦克阿瑟扶助日本政策，提出严重之抗议”；而直至六月一日，国民党的所谓“立法委员”也还在要求“政府迅速采取紧急措施，防止一切助长日本军事及经济力量之行动”。但是到了第二天即六月二日的早上，一切“美国扶助日本”的宣传，就忽然被宣布为“共匪军事间谍职业学生策动反美运动”！国民党反动派宣传上的这种混乱矛盾，证明这伙卖国贼在伟大的完全正义的人民运动面前，是何等地慌张，何等地手足无措！
    国民党反动派很得意地创造了一个“共匪军事间谍职业学生”的名词，用来污蔑和恫吓爱国的学生运动。但是反动派在这里又露了马脚。正如美联社上海五日电所说的，爱国的学生诉诸理智，而反动派所指挥的“反对派学生——其中包括右派‘职业家’，常常佩带武器——则以拳斗来回答”。尽人皆知，只有日暮途穷的国民党反动派，才豢养一群不读书的“职业学生”，专门从事于“佩带武器”和“拳斗”，以破坏人民的反抗运动。真的，如果他们不及时悔悟，他们不但会堕落为蒋介石的“军事间谍”，而且还会堕落为美国侵略者的“军事间谍”。跟国民党反动派一模一样，司徒雷登这个美国大使也用“阴谋”来污蔑英勇的中国爱国者。但是尽人皆知，正是那些法西斯的“防共”门徒，正是那些直接以行动来干涉中国学生校内活动的外国殖民主义者，正是那些中国特务机关“军事间谍”的外国指挥官，才是卑鄙的野蛮的阴谋分子。说到广大的爱国学生，那么，无论国民党反动派和司徒雷登之流怎样污蔑和恫吓，公道自在人心。上海中间分子的刊物“观察”写道：“学生已经成为了人民利益的发言人。……他们所争取的内容，已不仅仅限于他们自身的权利，他们的呼喊业已成为一种‘时代的声音’。……他们在现实的分析，理想的追求，办事的能力，奋斗的精神上，均已表现出惊人的成就；他们已隐然成为一个推动时代的巨轮。”这个事实，这个舆论，不是任何反动派的任何污蔑、恫吓所能够抹煞和改变的。事实上中美反动派对于中国人民的爱国民主运动每实行一次压迫，就增加一次自己的孤立，这已经成为规律了。跟以前一样，在这一次反对美国扶日政策的爱国运动中，司徒雷登和蒋介石政府又一次地威信扫地；而爱国的学生和人民，则将更加坚决地团结前进，直到他们的奋斗胜利为止。光明是属于学生，属于人民的。
