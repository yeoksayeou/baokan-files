[Report from our newspaper in Central Hebei] The wheat harvest in Ding County has been completed. The liberated peasants worked from dawn till dusk during the wheat harvest, organizing mutual aid teams to pull wheat. Women in various places also demonstrated a high level of enthusiasm for production. At a branch meeting in Liangjiaying, Fifth District, twenty party members volunteered to help military families pull wheat. Women in their forties, Ma Zhenzi and Yang Feng'e, also actively participated. In Dongchexie, out of 170 people involved in the wheat harvest, 64 were women. In six mornings, they pulled wheat on 84 mu. Women Wang Xiuge and Wang Lingtai developed blisters on their hands, and when others advised them to rest, they said, "It's nothing; it won't hurt in a couple of days." Women in Dong Yangmu, Shahe used to weave and spin at home, but this year they also went to the fields to pull wheat. Zhao Xiaoqiao and her two daughters pulled 1.5 mu in one morning. They said, "We didn't have much land in the past, but now that we have land, we must work in the fields." In Doufuying Street, Sixteenth District, the entire street organized mutual aid for pulling wheat. Men pulled in the fields, and women threshed at home. Men and women cooperated in threshing, and the wheat was all stored in the granary in seven days. In Hanzhuang, Twelfth District, 81 women, led by Wang Meisu and Wang Sukun, pulled wheat on 115 mu in three days, solving the difficulties of elderly, widowed, and labor-deficient households. Cadres from county and district organizations also organized to help the masses pull wheat. Cadres from the Chengguan District pulled more than 20 mu of wheat on the first day. A farmer in Baota Street didn't have a cart to transport his wheat, so the district cadres carried two mu of wheat on their backs for him. When merchants saw this on the street, they praised it highly: "These are still Communist Party cadres. In the past, those fascist officials wouldn't even think of carrying anything for the people. If wheat got too close to them, who knows what they would say." According to the masses in Majiazhai and Dongwencun, this year's wheat harvest is generally good, enough for an eight-year harvest. Preliminary statistics from 13 districts show that a total of 193,848 mu of wheat and 71,817 mu of barley were planted. With an average yield of seven dou per mu, more than 1,859,600 shi of wheat can be harvested, which will greatly improve the people's lives.

　　定县大批妇女参加拔麦碾场
    【本报冀中讯】定县麦收已告完成。翻身农民在麦收中起早摸黑，组织互助拨工，各地妇女也表现了极高的生产情绪。五区梁家营支部会上，二十个党员自动提出帮助军属拔麦，四十多岁的妇女马珍子、杨凤娥也积极参加，东车写麦收一百七十人中就有妇女六十四人参加，六个早晨拔麦八十四亩，妇女王秀格、王令台手上起了泡，别人劝她们休息，她说：“这没什么，过两天就不痛了。”沙河南东杨木妇女过去总是在家织布纺线，今年也下地拔麦，赵小桥家母女三人，一早上拔了一亩半，她们说：“往年地不多，现在有地了，不下地可不行。”十六区豆腐营街，组织了全街的拔麦互助，男的地里拔，女的家里压，男女合作碾场，七天就将麦子全部收拾到仓。十二区韩庄八十一个妇女，在王梅素、王素坤带领下，三天拔麦一百十五亩，解决了孤寡无劳力户的困难。县区的机关团体干部也组织起来帮助群众拔麦，城关区干部第一天拔麦二十多亩，宝塔街一户农民拔了没车拉，区干部就给他背了二亩麦子，回来走在街上，商民见了极为称赞：“还是共产党的干部，过去那法西斯派当官的，不用说给老百姓背，就是麦子离他近了，还不定骂什么呢。”据马家寨，东汶村的群众谈：今年麦收一般还好，足够八成年景。据十三个区的初步统计，共种小麦十九万三千八百四十八亩多，大麦七万一千八百十七亩，每亩平均以收七市斗争，可收麦一百八十五万九千六百多石，群众生活将因此而得到极大改善。
