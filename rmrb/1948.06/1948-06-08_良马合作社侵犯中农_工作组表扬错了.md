　　【Taiyue News】A branch report: The Tunliu Fifth District work team wrote a piece of news praising the Liangma Cooperative for solving the difficulties of military dependents and poor peasants. In fact, the Liangma Cooperative made a fundamental error in this matter. The article stated: When the Liangma Cooperative saw that military dependents and poor peasants had difficulties with no food, no livestock, and no seeds, it took out two mules from the cooperative, plowed 61 mu of land for the military dependents, planted 62 mu of grain, and delivered 165 cartloads of manure, all without profit. It lent the poor peasants 4 dou 3 of hemp seeds, 1 shi 2 of white bean seeds, 3 dou of small hemp seeds, and 686 oil cakes, plus fertilizer, all to be returned in the autumn. Of course, a mass cooperative should help organize mass production, but the Liangma Cooperative's method was not correct. Preferential treatment for military dependents is a matter for the entire village and should be borne proportionally based on the different labor and livestock of the entire village; only then is it fair and reasonable. Although the Liangma Cooperative's method also solved the difficulties of military dependents, it violated the principle of fair and reasonable burden sharing, placing this burden on the cooperative members. Furthermore, because the amount of shares varied, and the amount of shares was not equal to the amount of wealth and labor, it formed a situation where those with more shares bore a greater burden and those with fewer shares bore a smaller burden. It is clear that the Liangma Cooperative's approach was unfair, striking a blow to the cooperative members, and even more so to those with more shares. Secondly, lending seeds and bean cakes to poor peasants is permissible, but at least two things must be done: First, it must be discussed and approved by all cooperative members; if they do not agree, they cannot be forced to agree to lend. Second, a certain amount of interest is generally required on the items lent. If there are individual poor peasants who are truly in difficulty, it must be discussed and agreed upon by all cooperative members before interest-free loans can be made. However, the news praising the Liangma Cooperative did not mention these things; it only emphasized the lending. From this, it can be estimated that it may not have been discussed and approved by all cooperative members. This even more clearly harmed the interests of the cooperative members. The vast majority of those who invest in cooperatives are middle peasants, and this harms the interests of the middle peasants. The Liangma Cooperative's method is not actually calling for the development of the cooperative, but rather forcing the members to withdraw their shares, causing the cooperative to collapse. So, what is the correct method? First, preferential treatment for military dependents should be borne proportionally based on the labor, livestock, and wealth of the entire village. Second, the difficulties of poor peasants with food and seeds should be solved from the accumulated public fruits or from government loans. Third, if it is to be solved within the cooperative, it must be discussed and approved by all cooperative members; if they do not agree, it cannot be forced. Therefore, the Liangma Cooperative's erroneous behavior must be examined and corrected, and it must not be tolerated, let alone praised.

### 良马合作社侵犯中农　工作组表扬错了

　　良马合作社侵犯中农
  　工作组表扬错了
    【太岳消息】分社报导：屯留五区工作组写来了一篇新闻，表扬良马合作社解决军属贫雇困难。实际良马合作社在这件事情上，犯了原则的错误。稿里说：良马合作社看到军属贫农没吃没牲口没种籽困难时，就往合作社抽出骡子两头，给军属犁地六十一亩，种谷六十二亩，送粪一百六十五车，都不赚钱。借给贫农大麻籽四斗三，白豆籽一石二，小麻籽三斗，油饼六百八十六个，叫上肥料，这些都是秋后归还。当然，一个群众合作社，应该帮助组织群众生产的，但良马合作社的办法是不对头的，优待军属是全村人的事情，应按全村劳力畜力不同，分别负担，这才公道合理。良马合作社这种办法虽然也解决了军属困难，但是违反了负担公平合理的原则，把这种负担加在合作社社员身上，又因入股多少不同，入股多少又不等于富力劳力的多少，形成股多多负担，股少少负担，很明白的，良马合作社这种作法，是不公道的，打击了合作社员，更打击了入股多的社员。其次，借给贫农种籽、豆饼等，是可以的，但起码要作这两件事情：第一、必须经过全体社员讨论通过，不同意就不能强迫同意借出。第二借出的东西，一般要一定的利息，真有个别贫农，实在困难，必须经全体社员讨论同意，才能无利出贷。可是在表扬良马合作社的新闻中，就没有谈到这些，只是强调借出，从这估计，可能是没有经过全体社员讨论通过。这更明白的危害了合作社社员的利益，一般在合作社入股的，绝大部分是中农，这就伤害了中农利益。良马合作社的这种办法，实际上不是叫合作社发展，而是要逼的社员抽股，叫合作社垮台。那么，正当的办法是什么呢？第一优待军属，应以全村劳力畜力富力分别负担，第二贫农粮食种籽等困难，从积存的公共果实中解决，或从政府贷款中解决。第三如果要在合作社解决，那必须经合作社全体社员讨论通过，不同意就不能强作。因此，良马合作社的错误行为必须检查纠正，决不能放任，更不能表扬。
