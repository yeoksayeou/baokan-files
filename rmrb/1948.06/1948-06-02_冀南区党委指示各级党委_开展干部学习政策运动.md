　　Ji'nan District Party Committee Directs Party Committees at All Levels
  　Launch a Cadre Policy Study Movement
    [Ji'nan News] On May 23rd, the Ji'nan District Party Committee issued instructions to Party committees at all levels regarding cadre study, requiring the launch of a cadre policy study movement in the next eight months. The instructions first mentioned: "Since Chairman Mao's report on the Situation and Our Tasks on December 25th of last year, the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau have continuously issued many important instructions on the Party's basic line and policies in various aspects. The Land Law is a comprehensive class document, representing our Party's program, political platform, guiding principles, and policies, and it is the great charter of the Chinese people. In today's situation, clarifying the line and determining policies are the basis for winning national victory and preparing for the establishment of a New Democratic Republic. If our cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, cannot have a special understanding and skillful mastery of these instructions, our work will not be able to move forward, and it may even affect the victory of the revolution. Therefore, it has been decided to launch a cadre policy study movement from now until the end of this year, lasting eight months. Regarding specific work, it is stipulated that Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" and Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Cadre Conference in Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area" shall be the basic documents, combined with the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and Party rectification in old and semi-old areas, Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Questions in Land Reform," the Central Bureau's "Instructions on Land Reform, Party Rectification, and the Democratic Movement," the anti-left instructions given to the Taiyue and Taihang District Party Committees, the instructions on industrial and commercial policies, and Comrade Chen Boda's "Labor Policy and Tax Policy for the Development of Industry" as the content of study. Through the study of the above documents, Party members and cadres should be able to understand the current political situation in China more clearly and study what our tasks are in this situation. In order to complete these tasks, what kind of line, principles, and policies should we implement? In terms of learning methods, we advocate starting the machine, boldly doubting, repeatedly considering and researching, discussing with each other, and even launching debates, so as to enable comrades to solve problems ideologically. This kind of learning method must not be confused with the seriousness and discipline of implementing policies, and the implementation of policies must not be resisted on the pretext that ideological problems have not been resolved. The starting point of learning should be different for different cadres. For general office cadres, documents can be the main focus, combined with materials from actual work, to carry out research. County and district cadres, especially district-level cadres, should start from the problems encountered in their work. That is, learn what is needed, so as to achieve understanding from the solution of specific problems to the understanding of principles and theories. It is not necessary to be restricted by the original order of the documents. To achieve this, county-level cadres must give more help to general district-level cadres on issues of principle and theory, and frequently explain some issues to them. Therefore, for general county and district cadres, methods such as self-study and collective discussion using meeting opportunities, and large classes can be used to promote learning. During the learning process, a note-taking system and a testing system can be established as appropriate, so as to understand the cadres' learning experiences and questions and the degree of understanding of the issues at any time. In order to promote this study in an organized way, the District Party Committee instructed that study committees should be established at all levels above the county level, with the Party Committee as the core, and responsible comrades from various departments should participate. When there are too many units, one or several departments should be responsible by the head of the department, relying on the branch to organize sub-committees. The study committees at all levels are under the leadership of the Party committees at the same level, and the propaganda and education departments of the Party at all levels should become the working organs of the study committees at all levels. The study committees at all levels should plan to lead and check the study of cadres, and solve all difficult problems in the study. At the same time, in order to solve the difficult problems in the study of cadres from multiple aspects and to arouse the fashion of studying policies within the Party, cadres who encounter difficult problems in the study can not only raise them to the study committees at each level, but also directly raise them to Party newspapers and periodicals or responsible comrades at all levels, requesting answers." The instructions emphasized: "Chairman Mao has instructed us more than once: 'Policy is the starting point of all actions of a political party....' Therefore, the effect of this study of lines and policies depends on the degree to which the Party's policies are implemented in actual work. The region or individual that correctly implements the Party's policies in their work also proves that the unit or individual has learned the best." Finally, the District Party Committee also required that Party committees at all levels should include the leadership of study, the learning situation of cadres, and the reflections of all strata on our Party's policies as one of the contents in the report to the higher-level Party committee and the regular summary report.

　　冀南区党委指示各级党委
  　开展干部学习政策运动
    【冀南消息】五月二十三日，冀南区党委向各级党委发出关于干部学习的指示，要求在今后八个月内开展一个干部的政策学习运动。指示上首先提到：“自去年十二月二十五号毛主席形势与任务报告以后，党中央和中央局连续发出了很多关于党的基本路线和对各方面政策的重要指示。特别的阶级文件，是我党党纲政纲方针政策的综合，是中国人民的大宪章。在今天形势下，明确路线，确定政策，是争取全国胜利和准备新民主主义人民共和国建立的根据。我们的干部，特别是各级领导干部，如果不能对这些指示有特别的了解和熟练的掌握，则将使我们的工作不能前进，甚至会影响革命的胜利。因此决定自目前起到今年年底止，以八个月时间开展一个干部的政策学习运动。关于具体工作，规定以毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”，及毛主席“在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”为基本文件，结合中央关于在老区半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示、任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”、“中央局关于土地改革整党与民主运动的指示”、给太岳、太行区党委的反左指，关于工商业政策的指示、陈伯达同志“发展工业的劳动政策与税收政策”为学习内容。从以上这些文件的学习中，要使党员干部能较明确的了解中国目前的政治形势，研究在这形势下我们的任务是什么。为了完成这些任务，我们应该执行什么样的路线方针和政策。学习方法上，提倡开动机器、大胆怀疑、反复考虑研究、相互讨论，以致开展争论，务使同志们思想上解决问题。这种学习方法，绝不能与执行政策的严肃性、纪律性相混淆，不能借口思想没有解决问题而抵抗政策的实施。学习的着手，应依不同的干部有所区别。机关干部一般的可以文件为主，联系实际工作的材料，进行研究。县区干部，特别是区级干部，应从工作中所碰到的问题需要出发。也就是用什么学什么，这样求得从具体问题的解决到原则理论问题的了解。不必受文件原来次序的拘束。要作到这一点，关于原则理论问题，必须县级干部多给一般区级干部一些帮助，经常给他们解释一些问题。因此对一般县区干部可采自修和利用开会碰头机会，进行集体讨论，上大课的办法来推动学习。学习过程中，可根据情况建立笔记制度和测验制度，以便随时了解干部的学习心得和疑问及对问题的了解程度。为了有组织的推动这次学习，区党委指示要建立县以上各级学习委员会，以党委为核心，吸收各部门负责同志参加。单位过多时，以一个部门或几个部门，由部门首长负责，依靠支部，组织分会。各级学委会属同级党委领导，党的各级宣教部门应成为各级学委会的工作机关。各级学委会应有计划的领导检查干部的学习，并解决学习中的一切疑难问题。同时为了从多方面解决干部学习中的疑难，和在党内引起研究政策的风尚，干部在学习中遇有疑难问题，不但可向各该级学委会提出，还可以直接向党报刊物或各级负责同志提出，要求解答”。指示上强调的提出：“毛主席不止一次指示我们：‘政策是一个政党的一切行动的出发点……。’因此关于这次路线政策的学习效果怎样，就看在实际工作中对党的政策贯彻的程度怎样。那一个地区或个人在工作中贯彻执行党的政策正确，也就证明那一单位或个人学习的最好”。区党委最后并要求各级党委在向上级党委汇报和定期的总结报告中，应把关于学习的领导和干部学习情况及各阶层对我党政策的反映作为内容之一。
