According to letters from Hou Chunhua, a dyer from the Xiangshan Village Cooperative in the Eighth District of Ci County, and Liu ×× from × Village: Since the work team arrived in Houjiagou, they established a Poor Peasants Association, which was controlled by a few individuals. Hou Kangxun, Hou Shixun, and others served as members, deciding who to criticize and struggle against. The work team listened to one-sided accounts and ruthlessly attacked party members, even calling them "dung eaters." Out of the 307 households in the entire village, 28 were classified as landlords and 25 as rich peasants. The classification was entirely done by the Poor Peasants Association, without the participation of party members. A few individuals decided things, only thinking of classifying those who fed mules and donkeys as rich peasants. They said, "Our village has many landlords and rich peasants. If anyone disagrees, let them go to the public meeting and be classified." But everyone was afraid of being struggled against and dared not go to the meeting, so whatever classification was assigned, they accepted. For example, Hou Baoxian, who owned 33 mu of land, employed one small farmhand (15 years old), and owed 700 yuan in debt (with an interest rate of 3.7 dou of rice per 100 yuan), was classified as a rich peasant.

The struggle session began on February 19th. Three days prior, landlords Hou Chunrong and two others were detained in the militia headquarters. They were not questioned during the meeting, and the wives of several landlords, including Hou Fengchang, Hou Baoyi, Hou Jianxi's mother, and Hou Baofu, were summoned. When asked about silver dollars and clothing, Hou Baoyi's wife said she had none and was stripped of her clothes and beaten. She was beaten twice in two days, her skin was torn, and she almost died six times in one night. When Hou Baofu was asked about his property and how much wheat he had left, he said he had no property and only a little over four shi of grain. He was accused of being untruthful and beaten. Some of the villagers cried during the beating. The work team sarcastically said, "Hou Baofu isn't dead yet, but we're already mourning him!" Hou Baofu's wife was also stripped of her clothes and beaten. She was detained for four nights and hung up four times in the team headquarters, dying and then being revived. The work team said, "We're not beating flesh, but mud, willow trees." After returning home, she complained to Hou Baofu: "You're also a party member, you've also been a district cadre, you've also contributed, but it's all useless." Hou Baofu felt distressed and went to the backyard with a rope to hang himself, but was discovered and saved by a refugee from Tangyin living in the backyard. Hou Baofu joined the Communist Party in 1938 and served as the district committee secretary last year. His father was a landlord. This time, he was beaten by Li Mingjin and his wife. Li had some disagreements with him in the past and was incited to retaliate. Hou Baoxian, his brother, is the director of the armed forces committee in the Second District and a party member who has already crossed the Yellow River. After sealing Hou Baofu's house, his family of four was only given one quilt. The whole family has nothing to eat. For more than two months now, some middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants have had their property unsealed, but his has not. The whole family doesn't know where their next meal will come from, and no one is harvesting the wheat. Some time ago, the Poor Peasants Association took four dou of wheat and eight or nine dou of grain from his house, and even took away an old, skinny mule. Hou Jianxi's mother was also beaten. Hou Jianxi joined the army in 1939 and served as a chief of staff. He is now in the Northeast. Hou Fengchang's wife was asked about silver dollars and clothes. She said, "There's nothing left." They then asked her where the air-raid shelter was, hung her on a tree, and she was dead for a while before being revived. Her fourth son works in the supply department of a certain field army and has also crossed the river. Her eldest son works as an accountant in a leather factory in Pengcheng. Four militiamen were also sent to bring him back and beat him. Hou Jinrong was also struggled against. He is also a party member with a family of six, owning ten mu of land, and renting twenty-five mu. This time, his land was struggled against, his donkey was taken, and his belongings were confiscated.

The livestock of the 53 households whose doors were sealed were all taken, and the grain was distributed by the Poor Peasants Association. This was presided over by the work team. If they didn't do this, the Poor Peasants Association would say that they couldn't do anything for nothing all spring, and what was the point of them if they couldn't distribute things? Now there are many landlords begging for food. The work team, along with the Poor Peasants Association, said, "We've already struggled against them. If we change it now, it will make the Poor Peasants Association lose face." Hou Shixun, a member of the Poor Peasants Association, said in the street, "If we don't struggle against the middle peasants, we won't have anything. I won't do it." "If we only struggle against the landlords and not the middle peasants, we'll have to help them with things." The livestock that were taken are being fed in the militia headquarters. Hou Shixun even sold his own donkey, waiting to be allocated good livestock.

In the past struggles in Houjiagou, even though the party members were cadres, they had no power. They were controlled by a group of bad people who struggled against whoever they wanted. If party member cadres spoke up, they would be accused of protecting the landlords.

Refugees reflected: "These are all old dependents of soldiers who resisted Japan for many years, party members for many years, and district cadres, and they are still being dragged and beaten like this. Why did we flee here?..."

Liu ×× wrote in his letter: "This is entirely based on materials I personally investigated in Houjiagou. I am responsible. I didn't dare to tell the higher authorities, but after seeing the news about Houjiagou in the May 13th newspaper, I dared to ask. Are their class divisions based on the central government's instructions? Are middle peasants really not to be struggled against? Are mistakes in the struggle corrected? Is expanding the scope of the struggle correct? The work team's method of rectifying the party is: the captain slams the table and says that you have to say you have it, even if you don't. If you don't have it, what are you supposed to say? Is the Poor Peasants Association leading land reform and liberation, or is it organizing a few people to engage in sectarianism? Are they deliberately undermining the party's policies? If party members have not made mistakes, can they participate in the peasants' association?"

Hou Chunhua, the dyer, said: "What this village is doing is different from the policy. I asked at the meal hall during meal times. The newspaper says that corporal punishment has been abolished, but why are they still dragging and beating people in our street? The people in the street don't dare to say anything. I've been holding this in for over a month, and I'm so suffocated that I have to speak out now. I think this is all the fault of the work team."

### 磁县侯家沟　执行政策有偏向　希望磁县领导上检查公开答复

　　磁县侯家沟
  　执行政策有偏向
  　希望磁县领导上检查公开答复
    据磁县八区香山村合作社染匠侯春华及×村的刘××来信反映：自工作组到侯家沟以后，就成立起贫农团，被少数分子掌握，由侯康勋、侯士勋等为委员，说斗谁就斗谁，工作组听了片面的话，对党员无情打击，大骂党员是吃粪的。全村三百零七户，就划了二十八户地主，二十五户富农。完全由贫农团自己划，党员不参加，由几个人规定，光想找喂骡喂小驴的划成富农，他们说：“我村地主富农多，谁不愿意，就让他上大会场划”。但谁也怕斗，不敢上会场，划成啥就是啥。如侯保贤三十三亩地，用一个小雇工（十五岁），欠有七百元外债（每百元三斗七升米利租），被划成富农。
    这次从二月十九日开始斗争，三天前就把地主侯春荣等三人扣在民兵队部。开会时也没问他们，又叫来几户地主侯逢昌妻、侯宝宜妻、侯建喜娘、侯宝福等。问侯宝宜妻要现洋、衣物，她说没有，被削去衣服打了一顿，两天打了两顿，打的皮开肉绽，一黑夜断了六回气。又问侯宝福财物、麦子还有多少，他说财物没有。只有四石多谷子，于是说他不实际，拖打了一顿。打的时侯，有的老百姓哭。工作组讽刺说：“侯宝福没死，就给他吊孝！”侯宝福老婆也被剥掉衣服打了一顿，扣了四夜，在队部上了四吊，死了又救过来。工作队说：“打的不是肉，是泥，是柳树。”回家后她埋怨侯宝福：“你也在着党，也当过区干部，也出过一部分力，也是不顶事。”侯宝福觉着难过，拿着绳子去后院上吊，被后院住的汤阴的逃难户看见救了下来。侯宝福是一九三八年加入共产党的，去年当区委秘书，他父亲是地主，这次是叫李名金夫妇打的他，李与他过去就有些意见，被人挑拨，又来报复。侯宝贤是他兄弟，在二区当武委会主任，也是党员，已过了黄河。封了侯宝福门后，四口人只给了一条被子，全家没啥吃，到现在两个多月，有的中农、富裕中农启封了，他还没启封。全家也不知到哪赶嘴去了，麦子也没人割。前些时贫农团去他家拿了四斗麦子，八九斗谷子，连一个老瘦骡也牵走了。侯建喜娘也挨了一顿打。侯建喜在一九三九年参加部队，当参谋长，现在到东北去了。又问侯逢昌老婆要银元、衣裳，她说：“宝在没有了。”就打问她防空洞在哪里？吊在树上，一会吊死了，半天才反过来。她四儿子在某野战部队供给处也已过了河，大儿在彭城皮革工厂当会计，也派四个民兵，弄回来打了一顿。又斗侯金荣，他也是党员，六口人，十亩地，三十三年二十五亩地，这次把地斗了，驴也牵了，家里东西也没收了。
    被封门的五十三户，牲口都牵了，粮食都叫贫农团分了。工作队主持的，不这样贫农团说一春天一个钱活也不叫做，不能分东西，干他做什么？现在地主要饭的很多，工作队随着贫农团说：“已经斗了，再改过来怕贫农团面子不好看。”贫农委员侯士勋在街里说：“不斗中农，就没东西，我就不干了。”“光斗地主，不斗中农，还得我们往外帮东西。”牵的牲口都在民兵队部喂着，侯士勋连自己的驴都卖了，等着分好牲口。
    侯家沟历次斗争，党员虽是干部，就不掌权，被一伙坏人把持，说斗谁就斗谁，党员干部一说，就说是包庇地主。
    逃难户反映：“这都是几年老抗属、几年的党员、区干部，还这么拖打，看咱逃到这里为啥？………”
    刘××信上说：“这完全是我亲自去侯家沟调查的材料，我负责任。我不敢向上级说，看见五月十三日报上登了侯家沟的消息，我才敢问。他们划阶级是不是根据中央指示？中农是不是真不斗？斗错了是不是改正？扩大斗争面积是不是对？工作队整党的办法是：队长一拍桌子，有也得说，没有也得说，没有的叫说什么？贫农团是领导土改翻身，还是组织几个人闹宗派？故意破坏党的政策？党员没有错是不是能参加农会？”
    染匠侯春华说：“这村所做的与政策不同，我吃饭时间到饭场上问，报上说废除肉刑，怎么咱街又拖又打，街上的人都不敢吭。我在肚里装了一个多月，闷的我现在可要说了。我想，这都是工作组的错误。”
