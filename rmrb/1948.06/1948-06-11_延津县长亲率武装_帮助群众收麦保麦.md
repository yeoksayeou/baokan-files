　　【News from Ji-Lu-Yu】Yanjin County is a region facing the enemy on three sides. On May 25th, two battalions of the enemy's 40th Division, 316th Regiment, in coordination with the Fengqiu and Yanjin local reactionary landlord armed "security corps" and village governments, harassed the area from Xinxiang, reaching Yanjin city that day. Wang Sanzhu's bandits, about two regiments, arrived at Liang Village in Ji County. One battalion of the enemy's 40th Division, 317th Regiment, in coordination with the puppet 12th Security Regiment and the Jun County Security Corps, arrived at Banqiao and Qimen. The three groups of enemies came out to harass in a planned manner on the 25th, with the planned purpose of搶麦 [robbing wheat]. In this tense situation, in addition to sending sentries to monitor the enemy's movements and actively engaging in armed protection of the masses' wheat harvest, the county public security team spared time every day to help the masses harvest wheat. From the 26th to the 28th, they helped the masses harvest a total of 47 mu of wheat in the Tangzhuang wheat fields. Li Yuhuai, the county chief of the county, led a part of the armed forces and cadres from various units to also help the masses harvest wheat on the 26th. In one morning, more than 30 people harvested 15 mu of wheat. In the process of harvesting wheat, they publicized the Outline Land Law, calling on the masses to harvest quickly, thresh quickly, and store quickly, so as not to let the enemy rob a single grain. In addition, they also actively dispatched armed forces to penetrate behind enemy lines to eliminate small groups of enemies.
