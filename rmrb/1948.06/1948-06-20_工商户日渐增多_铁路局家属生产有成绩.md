　　Growing Number of Industrial and Commercial Businesses
  　Railway Bureau Family Production Achieves Results
    [Shijiazhuang News] Under the protection and development of industry and commerce policies of the democratic government, the number of industrial and commercial businesses in Shijiazhuang is increasing daily. According to a survey in the Second Street of the Second District and the Donghuayuan Street area of the Fourth District alone, in addition to the resumption of business by existing industrial and commercial households, there are 109 new ones (some of which are stall vendors). These include chemical, textile, ironwork, chalk, cigarette and other factories, commercial firms and silver houses.
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Railway Bureau here has achieved initial results in organizing production by the families of employees. Starting in early February, the bureau organized some employees' families to sew soles, dismantle rags, and make ge bo for the clothing factory. In early April, a textile factory was established, funded by the Railway Cooperative. Forty spinning wheels were issued, and spinners took the cotton from the factory to spin at home, earning rice by delivering the yarn. Three knitting machines in the factory were used by nine women working together to knit socks, totaling 84 dozen socks and 40 dozen stocking uppers by the end of May, earning a net profit of more than 7 million yuan. The spinning group spun a total of 86 jin of yarn. In addition, more than ten women sewed sock openings for the factory. Including other work groups and two families running small stalls, there are now more than 60 women and family members participating in production, earning more than 1,200 jin of millet, which has helped to supplement family life, and some women have changed their past habits of relying solely on men.
