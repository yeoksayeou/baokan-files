Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Shanghai dispatch: The increasingly fierce wave of price increases has triggered new strike incidents. Two thousand employees of the Jianghai Customs, after their demand for wage increases was rejected by the authorities, began a strike on the afternoon of the 18th. They are demanding that their compensation be readjusted based on the cost of living index and that they receive one month's salary in advance. Agence France-Presse reports: "The customs employees' strike is a typical example of the accelerated devaluation of the 'legal tender' and the parallel rise in prices of various goods. The price increases particularly affect employees with fixed incomes." Another dispatch: Typesetters at all newspapers in Beijing once staged a strike on the morning of the 17th due to demands for wage increases, resulting in the failure to publish all nineteen newspapers in the city that morning.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reuters reports: On the 18th, the black market exchange rate for US dollars in Shanghai rose to 2.5 million (Chiang currency - same below), an increase of 400,000 compared to the 15th. According to an Associated Press report on the same day, prices of various commodities in Shanghai continued to soar to keep pace with the black market exchange rate. Many rice shops have closed their doors, and the black market price of rice remains at 11 million per shi (a unit of dry measure). In other major cities under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, such as Beijing and Tianjin, prices are also rising rapidly. In the past half-month, the price of flour in Beijing has soared by 70%, and the prices in large silk and satin shops in Tianjin rose by 10% overnight on the 16th. Furthermore, according to a report in the Tianjin Dagongbao on June 7th: Although the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, no one dares to imagine enjoying the festival as in the past. Last year, each zongzi (rice dumpling) only cost 500 yuan, but this year's Dragon Boat Festival costs 10,000 yuan. Last year, pork cost 11,000 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), but this year it costs 250,000 yuan. Last year, millet cost 3,000 yuan per jin, but this year it costs 68,000 yuan. Last year, corn cost 5,100 yuan per jin, but this year it costs 88,000 yuan. A family of eight cannot manage on less than 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per day just to eat cornmeal, let alone a higher standard of living.

　　物价猛涨要求增资
  　沪海关职员二千罢工
  　北平报馆排字工人一度罢工
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海消息：日益猛烈的物价涨风，已引起新的罢工事件。江海关职员二千人因要求增资遭当局拒绝，已于十八日午后起举行罢工。他们要求依据生活指数重新调整待遇，并预支一月薪金。据法新社称：“海关职员的罢工，是‘法币’加速贬值及与之相平行的各货上涨的情况所造成的典型例子。物价的上涨特别影响固定收入的职员。”另息：北平全市报馆排字工人曾因要求增资于十七日上午一度举行罢工，该日上午全市十九家报纸均未能出版。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】据路透社报导：十八日上海美汇黑市已涨至二百五十万元（蒋币——下同），较十五日又上涨四十万元。据同日美联社报导称：沪市各项商品均继续狂涨，以与外汇黑市并驾齐驱。许多米店均已关上大门，黑市米价每石仍为一千一百万元。北平、天津等蒋介石统治下的其他大城市，物价均在急速上涨中，半月以来，北平面粉已飞涨百分之七十，天津大绸缎店的价格，十六日一夜之间即上涨百分之十。另据天津大公报六月七日载称：虽端午节到来，象过去那样领略佳节的风味，现已无人敢作此想。粽子去年每个尚仅售五百元，今年端午节却要一万元了。猪肉每斤去年一万一千元，今年要二十五万元。小米每斤去年三千元，今年六万八千元。玉米去年每斤五千一百元，今年八万八千元。一个八口之家，仅吃玉米面，每天也非七八十万元不行，更谈不上较高生活标准了。
