　　Zhangnan Trains Militia
  　Prepares for Action to Protect Wheat
    [Taihang News] The Zhangnan County Party Committee convened a meeting of district chiefs on May 5th to discuss and organize the struggle to protect the wheat harvest. The third, fourth, and seventh districts of the county, which are close to the enemy, are constantly harassed, and the masses are demanding protection of the wheat. At the meeting, specific methods for protecting the wheat harvest were studied based on the conditions in each district, and the slogan "Grow your own, eat your own, don't let the enemy steal a single grain of wheat" was put forward. During the wheat harvest, shock teams should be organized to harvest quickly, thresh quickly, and hide quickly; harvest continuously, thresh continuously, and hide continuously; harvest one piece as it ripens. Cadres at all levels should directly participate in helping the masses to harvest quickly, do everything possible to store the wheat well, and starve the enemy to death. In order to strengthen armed protection of the wheat, the county has trained a large number of militiamen in Liuyuan, preparing to go to the border areas to carry out wheat protection struggles.

  　准备出击保麦
    【太行消息】漳南县委于五月五号召开各区长会议，讨论与组织保卫麦收斗争。本县靠敌人的三、四、七区，敌人不断出扰，群众要求保麦。会上根据各区情况，具体研究了保卫麦收办法，提出“自种自吃，不让敌人抢走一颗麦”的口号，在麦收时要组织抢收突击组，作到快割、快打、快藏，连收、连打、连藏，熟一片割一片。各级干部要直接参加帮助群众抢收，全力收藏好麦子、困死敌人。该县为加强武装保麦，已在柳园训练了大量民兵，准备出动到边沿区进行护麦斗争。
