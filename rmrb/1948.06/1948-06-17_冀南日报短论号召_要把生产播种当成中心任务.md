Jinnan News: Jinnan experienced a thorough rain on June 7th, and the Jinnan Daily immediately published a short commentary, calling on cadres at all levels to actively lead the masses to promptly plant late seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest this year. The commentary stated: "To strive for a bumper harvest, everyone must work in a timely manner. There are too many tasks at hand; some wheat hasn't been harvested yet, some that has been harvested hasn't been threshed, early seedlings need weeding, and wheat stubble fields need planting. Everything feels urgent and allows for no delay. To complete these tasks in the same period, good organization, leadership, and necessary measures are required." The commentary emphasized: helping and leading the masses to quickly harvest, thresh, weed, and plant. All regions should make production and sowing the central task. Mass meetings during the production period should be suspended. Close attention should be paid to saving manpower and animal power; on the basis of genuine voluntary participation by the masses and according to their urgent needs, temporary mutual aid should be organized to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power shortages. Regarding burden policies, the masses should be informed that "any additional harvest gained from their own deep plowing, careful cultivation, and increased fertilization will not result in increased burdens." Once the masses' concerns are dispelled, and with the addition of cadre organization and leadership, the task of production and sowing can be completed." The commentary pointed out that quick harvesting, threshing, weeding, and sowing cannot be separated into segments but must be carried out in combination, with careful arrangements made. If temporary mutual aid can be organized to carry them out simultaneously, that would be best. If mutual aid cannot be organized, according to the experience of the masses in Xu Guzhai, "three half-days of labor for people and two half-days of labor for oxen" is a good combined method, that is, after completing the harvesting rush, hoeing seedlings or sowing in the morning, and sunning and threshing wheat in the afternoon. Organizing semi-laborers to sun the wheat, so that full laborers can hoe seedlings and sow for two half-days, and thresh wheat for one half-day. Masses in various regions have experience in these kinds of methods. The key lies in whether the leaders can be good at discovering and promptly disseminating them.

　　冀南日报短论号召
  　要把生产播种当成中心任务
    【冀南讯】冀南六月七日落了透雨，冀南日报立即发表短论，号召各级干部，积极领导群众及时种上晚苗，争取今年丰收。短论称：“要争取实现丰收，必须大家干活应时。目前摆的活太多了；一部分麦子还没割，割了的还没打场，早苗要锄，麦茬地要种，样样都象火烧眉毛，不容丝毫拖延。要在同一时期完成这些任务，就需要有很好的组织领导和必要的措施。”短论中强调指出：帮助、领导群众快收、快打、快锄、快种，所有地区，都应该把生产播种当成中心任务。生产期间群众会议一律停开。要十分注意节省人力畜力；在群众真正自愿的基础上，根据群众的迫切要求，组织临时互助，解决人畜力缺乏的困难。在负担政策上，要向群众说明：“由于自己的深耕细作、多施肥而多得的收获，一概不多纳负担。这样群众的顾虑打破了，再加上干部的组织领导，这个生产播种的任务是可以完成的”。短论指出：快收、快打、快锄、快种不能分开段落，必须结合进行，很好的安排一下。若能组织临时互助，分头同时进行最好，若不能组织互助，根据徐固寨群众的经验，“人三晌牛两晌”是一种很好的结合办法，即收割突击完后，早晨锄苗或耩种，前后晌晒麦打场。组织半劳力晒麦，使全劳力能两晌锄苗耩种，一晌打麦。这类办法各地群众都有经验，在于领导者能够善于发现及时传播。
