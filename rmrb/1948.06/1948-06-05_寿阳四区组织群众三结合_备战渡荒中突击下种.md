　　Shouyang Fourth District Organizes the Masses Through a Three-Way Combination
  　Preparing for Famine Relief While Seizing the Time to Sow Seeds
    [Shouyang News] The Fourth District of Shouyang has been continuously subjected to destruction and looting by Yan bandit's 49th Division. Currently, it is the critical period for sowing seeds. On the 2nd of last month, a district and village cadre meeting was convened by the joint defense, proposing the slogan of a three-way combination to seize the time to sow seeds while also gathering wild vegetables for famine relief, and not forgetting the enemy's sabotage of sowing. After everyone's discussion, the combined approach was: the seizure of the time to sow seeds is based on the principle of voluntary combination, organizing temporary mutual aid teams without formal structures. Military dependents, families of martyrs, widowers, widows, and orphans are to be assisted by village cadres to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power for sowing, but it must be with compensation. Gathering wild vegetables and tree leaves for famine relief is the responsibility of women and children. In severely famine-stricken villages such as Yancun, out of 115 households, 32 households cannot survive a day without each person collecting three catties of wild vegetables and tree leaves. In combination with war preparedness, all non-essential items are to be abandoned, leaving only quilts, pots, and bowls. Men are responsible for carrying a load of dry food, and women are responsible for carrying a basket of seeds. Households with livestock are responsible for carrying a load. They are to be brought to the fields every day. Upon discovering enemy activity, they will transfer without returning home. This way, work is not delayed, and the enemy cannot seize anything. Militiamen carry guns and hand grenades to the fields and, upon discovering enemy activity, will immediately provide cover for the masses to transfer. This three-way combination approach to seize the time to sow seeds is suited to the specific situation and the needs of the masses. Based on these requirements, mass mobilization meetings were convened by natural villages, breaking the masses' mentality of waiting for the season, and the masses' confidence in rushing to plant early has been boosted. Currently, all twelve villages in the Fourth District have completed sowing peas, yellow and black beans, yams, corn, and sesame. Most of the millet has also been sown, and the remaining late crops such as naked oats and buckwheat have not yet been sown. The main reason for the vigor in production is the promotion of the Land Law Outline, which has given the masses a solid foundation. At the same time, households that were wrongly classified as middle peasants have been compensated, stabilizing the production morale of middle peasants, and the provision of food relief, grain loans, and loans has also helped. The masses also have the experience of not being able to sow last spring, suffering from severe drought in the summer, early frost in the autumn resulting in no harvest and hunger, and the experience of transferring and retreating during wartime. Furthermore, strengthened leadership has contributed to this year's achievements in early sowing and rushing to plant.

　　寿阳四区组织群众三结合
  　备战渡荒中突击下种
    【寿阳消息】寿阳四区不断遭阎匪四十九师的破坏和抢掠，目前正在下种紧急时期，在上月二号以联防召开了区村干部会议，提出三结合口号，突击下种还得采菜渡荒，又不能忘了敌人破坏下种。经过大家讨论后，得出结合办法是：突击下种以自愿结合原则，组织临时的没有形式的互助变工组，军干烈属鳏寡孤独，由村干部负责给解决下种人畜力困难，但必须有代价。渡荒采野菜树叶，由妇女儿童负责，灾荒特别严重的如沿村，共一一五户，内有卅二户每人每日没有三斤野菜树叶就不能过一天。在战争结合上是将所有不紧用的东西全部放了，只留下被子锅碗，由男人负责担一担干粮，由妇女负责提一篮种籽，有牲口户负责驮一驮，每天上地带到地，发现敌情转移不回家。这样也不误工，敌人也抢不着。民兵上地背枪带上手榴弹，发现敌情即掩护群众转移。在这样三结合下突击下种，是适合具体情况和群众要求的。根据这些要求，以自然村召开了群众动员会，打破了群众等季节思想，群众的抢种早种信心起来了。现在四区共十二个编村，豌豆、黄黑豆、山药、玉茭、胡麻等已全部种完，谷也大部下种，其余的晚作物莜荞麦等未种。生产有劲的主要原因是宣传土地法大纲，群众蹬了底，同时将斗错中农户作了补偿，安定了中农生产情绪，救济了粮食和贷粮贷款，群众又有去年春天没种上、夏天苦旱、秋霜早降无收成饿肚子和战争到来转移退却的经验，又加强领导才有今年的早种抢种的成绩。
