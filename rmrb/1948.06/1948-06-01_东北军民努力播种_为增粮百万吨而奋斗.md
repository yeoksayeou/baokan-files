Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: The vast military and civilians in the Northeast Liberated Areas are working hard to sow seeds and striving to complete the task of increasing grain production by one million tons. To complete this plan, the Northeast Administrative Committee has telegraphed all provinces to adopt effective measures to ensure that all cultivated land is sown. The chairmen of the provincial governments are responsible for this. Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin, the two chairmen of the Political Committee, have gone to the grain-producing areas of North Manchuria to inspect in person. In order to complete the task of sowing 4 million hectares and harvesting 10 million shi of grain, Yan Baohang and Huang Oudong, the chairman and vice chairman of Liaobei Province, have gone to the countryside to supervise and urge planting. Yu Yifu, the chairman of Nenjiang Province, and the heads of various departments have also gone to the countryside to inspect spring plowing. In Lindian County of the province, which is suffering from a serious spring famine, the provincial government has established a disaster relief and frugality committee, allocated 1.5 million jin of disaster relief grain, and moved 7,000 households of disaster victims to reclaim wasteland. The Political Committee has also specially approved the county's exemption from fishing and salt taxes for three months, organizing the masses to fish, boil salt, and produce for self-relief. Zhaodong County lacks seeds, and the provincial government has allocated 40,000 jin of seeds. With the difficulties in the above two counties resolved, they are now smoothly rushing to plant. In other counties, autumn field sowing can be completed within a week. In Fuyu County, over 150,600 hectares of autumn fields have been sown. Including over 190,200 hectares of wheat sown, the county's sown area has increased by over 19,600 hectares compared with last year. Chairmen and department heads of other provinces have also gone deep into the countryside to inspect. The Jilin Provincial Government and Provincial Party Committee have organized cadres to go to the countryside to assist in planting. The Jibei Special Commissioner's Office has also used 5 million yuan as bonuses to organize a spring plowing competition. The Jinan Special Commissioner's Office has also issued agricultural loans of 100 million yuan to Shuangyang, Huadian, and Panshi new districts to solve spring plowing difficulties. Songjiang Province has also allocated a portion of grain to solve the spring famine. Provincial Chairman Feng Zhongyun has also personally gone to Hejiang Province to negotiate the purchase of grain. All provinces can complete the sowing plan within twenty days at the latest. Hejiang and Mudanjiang provinces are organizing wasteland reclamation to expand cultivated land. Li Yanlu, the chairman of Hejiang Province, has also called on farmers to apply more fertilizer and strive to increase production by an average of three dou per hectare.
