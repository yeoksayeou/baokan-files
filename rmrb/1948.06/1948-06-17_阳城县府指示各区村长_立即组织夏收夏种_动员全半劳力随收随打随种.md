　　Yangcheng County Government Instructs District and Village Heads
  　Immediately Organize Summer Harvesting and Planting
    Mobilize All and Part-Time Labor to Harvest, Thresh, and Plant Simultaneously
    [Taiyue News] On June 10th, the Yangcheng County Government instructed district and village heads to immediately mobilize and organize the masses for summer harvesting and planting. It also pointed out the following in summer harvesting and planting: (1) It is necessary to correct the past tendency of unequal exchange or excessively low wages hindering voluntary combination, rectify mutual aid teams, and organize full and part-time male and female laborers to participate in wheat harvesting and stubble removal work. Fairly determine distribution, appropriately assign tasks, and give full play to everyone's role, so as to achieve simultaneous harvesting, threshing, and planting. (2) Earnestly help the masses solve the difficulties in summer planting. The difficulty of seeds mainly relies on the masses' conscious and voluntary mutual adjustment or transportation from outside to solve. The bean seeds stored by the cooperatives should be taken out for adjustment. In addition, organize the masses' manpower and financial resources to purchase seeds in other counties. For households that are truly unable to buy or exchange seeds (including landlords and rich peasants), the village should actively find ways to lend them, to be returned in the autumn. In addition, the government will issue seed loans of 30 million Jiao banknotes. The district offices will adjust livestock power according to the actual situation. If it is not enough, it can be solved through equal-value labor exchange and mutual assistance. Those who cannot afford labor or wages at the moment should, after consultation between the two parties, pay in the autumn, so that neither party suffers a loss and everyone is guaranteed to plant and no land is left uncultivated. (3) Family members of military martyrs, cadres, participating laborers, and militiamen should be mobilized to work themselves. Those with insufficient labor or no labor should be given mutual aid and cultivation without compensation, half compensation, or full compensation, depending on the family's situation. The production of participating militiamen and laborers should achieve three priorities (wheat harvesting first, stubble removal first, seedling weeding first) and four goods (good wheat harvest, good stubble removal, good seedling weeding, good difficulty resolution), and attention must be paid to helping them solve problems at any time. In addition to doing these tasks well, it is also necessary to call on the masses to select seeds to prevent black blight next year. Finally, the instructions urged cadres to personally take action, carefully study the local situation, and make plans, and also to report the achievements and experiences in the work in a timely manner.

　　阳城县府指示各区村长
  　立即组织夏收夏种
    动员全半劳力随收随打随种
    【太岳讯】阳城县府于六月十日指示各区村长，立即动员组织群众夏收夏种。并指出在夏收夏种中：（一）必须纠正过去交换不等价或工资太低妨碍自愿结合的偏向，整顿互助组，组织男女全半劳力参加割麦回茬工作。公平订分适当分工，发挥每个人的作用，做到随收随打随种。（二）认真帮助群众解决夏种中的困难。种籽的困难主要依靠群众自觉自愿的互相调剂或出外运输解决。合作社积存的豆籽应全部拿出调剂。另外组织群众人力财力到外县采买种籽。对确实无力买籽换籽的户（包括地主富农），村里应积极设法借给，秋后归还。此外政府发放种籽贷款冀钞三千万元。区公所根据实际情况调剂畜力，不够可以等价变工互助解决。当下还不起工或出不起工资的，经过两家商量，秋后给钱，作到互不吃亏，保证都能种上，空不了地。（三）军烈干属参战民工民兵家属，应动员他们自己劳动，劳力不足和没劳力的，按家庭情况分别给予无代价半代价或全代价的互助代耕，参战民兵民工的生产，要作到三头（麦收在头，回茬在头，苗锄在头）。四好（麦收好，回茬好，苗锄好，困难解决好），并须随时注意帮助他们解决问题。除了做好这些工作以外，还要号召群众选种，防止明年黑疸，指示最后叮嘱干部要亲自动手，详细研究当地情况作出计划，还要把工作中的成绩经验及时报告。
