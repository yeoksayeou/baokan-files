　　Ji-Lu-Yu Wheat Protection Campaign Scores a Major Victory
  　Annihilating 1,800 Enemies South of Juan
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] Henan General Branch News: Our military region's armed forces actively struck at the enemy and protected the masses' wheat harvest, achieving a great victory. On the night of the 2nd, our army surrounded the enemy east of Shiji, Xushawo, and Zhangniulou south of Juan (cheng), and on the morning of the 2nd, completely annihilated the enemy's Second Ninth Brigade's logistics battalion. The 86th Regiment from Zhangniulou fled northeast, and on the night of the 3rd, we moved southeast, encountering the enemy at Lizhuang and Duzhuang, immediately eliminating a portion of the puppet Puyang County Brigade, and surrounding the enemy's 86th Regiment. On the morning of the 3rd, the enemy from Heze came to reinforce with three regiments, launching several assaults, all of which were repelled. We also had gains in intercepting and attacking the reinforcements. On the evening of the 3rd, we launched an attack on the enemy's 86th Regiment, and within a quarter of an hour, we entered the village, and after fierce street fighting, the enemy was completely annihilated except for scattered personnel who escaped. In the fighting on the 2nd and 3rd, a total of 1,500 enemies were captured, and 300 were killed or wounded. More than ten heavy machine guns, around fifty 60mm mortars, two mortars, and a radio station were seized. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. This battle cleared the enemy within the areas of Juancheng and Linze counties, and dealt a serious blow to Liu Ruming, the Chiang bandit of Heze, which has great significance for protecting the masses' wheat harvest on the south bank of the Yellow River.
    At this moment, the local armed forces of our Seventh Military Subdistrict are besieging the enemy guarding the city of Wenshang, and there are no more strongholds outside the city. The First Military Subdistrict recently captured strongholds such as Taixi and Liulangfen. The troops of each military subdistrict are all advancing victoriously.
