Sublime Revolutionary Feelings, Great Heroic Spirit!
    East China and Central Plains Field Armies
  　Extend Cordial Greetings
    Pledge Three Army Groups Will Fight Side by Side for the Liberation of the People of Central Plains.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 16th] The People's Liberation Army's Central Plains Field Army and parts of the East China Field Army, which advanced into the Central Plains, have been cooperating in combat since they met on the Pinghan Railway in December last year. Recently, the military and political leaders, chiefs of staff, directors of political departments, and all commanders and fighters of the two field armies exchanged letters of greetings. The original letters are as follows:
    East China Field Army's Letter of Greetings to Beloved Comrades:
    All comrades of the East China Field Army extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to you! With your heroic actions as the vanguard of the southern line offensive, you began to cross the Yellow River on June 30 last year, achieving the great victory of annihilating nine and a half enemy brigades in southwestern Shandong; and taking advantage of the victory, you marched into the enemy's deep rear, liberating vast areas and people in the Central Plains. This series of counter-offensive victories and the great march of yours mobilized and dispersed the enemy's forces for the "key offensive" against Shandong, enabling our East China troops to annihilate the enemy more favorably, and in coordination with the various battlefields across the country, and with your joint efforts in coordinated operations, we finally shattered the enemy's "key offensive," permanently depriving the enemy of strategic initiative. When we recall the tense situation and arduous combat life on the East China battlefield under the enemy's "key offensive," we naturally sincerely thank the military and civilians in the liberated areas for their support and coordination, especially the fraternal army groups adjacent to East China and fighting alongside us—the Liu-Deng Army.
    We should also represent the people of East China to express our gratitude and respect to you. The people of East China know that their early re-liberation is inseparable from your glorious victories and arduous struggles. Your advance into the Dabie Mountains threatened the heart of the Chiang bandits. In order to maintain the partial peace of the Chiang family's small court, the Chiang bandits adopted an offensive defense of the Dabie Mountains; you then undertook the glorious task of holding the Dabie Mountains, overcoming all difficulties, enduring all hardships, making your own cotton clothes, finding your own firewood and rice, fighting continuously, without rest, and you finally held out victoriously. Now the Hubei-Henan-Anhui liberated area is a sharp sword inserted into the heart of the Chiang bandits, and the victories on all battlefields are inseparable from your arduous struggle in the Dabie Mountains, and our victories along the Longhai and Pinghan lines and in Luoyang are especially inseparable from your direct cooperation.
    Now, in order to annihilate the enemy more effectively, the three army groups have joined together. In the future, we will have more and more direct coordinated operations, and therefore more opportunities to learn from your excellent style, especially your flexible tactics and the spirit of studying tactics, learning from your practical, simple, and democratic work style and the glorious tradition of hard struggle. In the future, under the correct line of the Party Central Committee and the unified leadership of the Central Plains Bureau, we will work together to consolidate and build the Central Plains Liberated Area.
    We wish you common victory and good health, comrades!
    Respectfully,
    Chen Yi, Su Yu, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, and all commanders and fighters

　　Central Plains Field Army's Reply, Respected Comrades:
    We should first extend our highest respect to our closest comrades-in-arms—all the comrades of the East China Field Army! We express our deep gratitude for your greetings!
    In the early period of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, we and the East China Army Group cooperated most closely, like the left and right hands, in attacking the enemy. Your seven battles and seven victories in central Jiangsu, the great victory in Subei, the great victory in southern Shandong, the great victory in Laiwu, the great victory in Menglianggu, and other great victories, wrote a brilliant page in the history of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War. These great victories powerfully encouraged every one of our commanders and fighters. You shouldered the most important and most arduous front in the country at that time—the East China battlefield. Because you victoriously shattered the enemy's "key offensive," you created a favorable situation for our Jilu-Yu battlefield at that time to annihilate the enemy and win victory; your heroic spirit of being indomitable, tenacious, and unafraid of danger is admired by all our comrades and must be learned.
    Last year, in the great offensive, we fought to the Jianghuai River and the Han River, reaching the Yangtze River. Three army groups—the East China Army Group, the Chen-Xie Army Group, and us—stood like tripods, echoing each other. You covered our strategic breakthrough and annihilated the Chiang bandit's 57th Division, cutting off Chiang Kai-shek's internal war artery—the Longhai Railway, which facilitated our strategic deployment in the Dabie Mountains. Just as the enemy was making a dying struggle in the Dabie Mountains, carrying out the so-called "key defense," you and the Chen-Xie Army Group launched the Pinghan Campaign, annihilating the Chiang bandit's 5th Corps Headquarters and the entire 3rd Division, and inflicting a devastating blow on the 20th Division. The meeting of the three armies on the Pinghan Railway gave us direct help, which is deeply remembered and unforgettable by every comrade who persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains. Today, our three army groups are fighting side by side, and the help to the Dabie Mountains will be even greater. We have stood firm on the Dabie Mountains, and the sharp sword given to us by Chairman Mao has been inserted into the enemy's heart, which is inseparable from your victorious battles. Here, we especially represent all the comrades who persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains, and extend our comrades-in-arms greetings to you.
    Now our three army groups are shouldering the strategic task of liberating the entire Jianghuai River and the Han River, which gives us more opportunities to learn from you. Learn from your fighting style of bravely annihilating the enemy; learn from your scientific attitude of paying attention to investigation and research, meticulous planning, and timely summarizing experience; the spirit of tireless effort to improve military art; learn from your model of urban policy in conquering Luoyang by you and the Chen-Xie Army Group; learn from your experience in the land reform study, the three check-ups, and the three consolidations movement; learn from your new creations in the merit-making and model creation movement and the cultural work construction of the troops; and learn even more from your spirit of unity and friendship in actively helping fraternal units. Your delegation has not only given our troops much education and encouragement in political and artistic work, but also your vigorous, enthusiastic, and hardworking work style has made us admire you.
    The three army groups will work together to realize Chairman Mao's strategic task—to liberate the entire Central Plains!
    Wishing all comrades of the East China Field Army good health!
    Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Zhang Jichun, Li Da, Zeng Xisheng, and all commanders and fighters of the Central Plains Field Army
    　　　　　　June 1st

　　崇高的革命感情，伟大的英雄气概！
    华东中原两野战军
  　互相亲切慰问
    共勉三大兵团并肩携手，为解放全中原人民而战。
    【新华社中原前线十六日电】挺进中原的人民解放军中原野战军和华东野战军各一部，自去年十二月间在平汉线会合后，经常配合作战。最近两野战军军政首长参谋长政治部主任及全体指战员曾互相致函慰问。原信如下：
    华东野战军的慰问信亲受的同志们：
    华东野战军全体同志，谨向你们致崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问！你们以南线进攻先锋的英勇行动，于去年六月三十日开始抢渡黄河，获得了鲁西南歼敌九个半旅的伟大胜利；并且乘胜进军，挺入敌人的纵深后方，解放了中原广大的地区和人民。你们这一连串的反攻胜利和伟大的进军，调动并分散了敌人对山东“重点进攻”的兵力，使华东我军更有利的歼灭敌人，并且在全国各个战场的配合呼应，与你们协同作战的共同努力下，最后粉碎了敌人的“重点进攻”，永远剥夺了敌人的战略主动权。我们一回忆起华东战场处在敌人“重点进攻”下的紧张形势和艰苦的战斗生活，便自然的衷心感谢各解放区军民对我们的支援和配合，尤其是与华东亲邻并和我们并肩作战的兄弟兵团——刘邓大军。
    我们还应该代表华东人民，对你们致感谢和敬意。华东人民知道：他们能早日重获解放，是与你们光辉的胜利和艰苦的奋战不可分的。你们挺进大别山威胁了蒋匪的心脏。蒋匪为维持蒋家小朝廷的偏安，对大别山采取了攻势防御；你们又担当了坚持大别山的光荣任务，克服了一切困难，忍受了一切艰苦，自己做棉衣，自己弄柴米，连续战斗，不懈不休，你们终于胜利的坚持下来了。现在鄂豫皖解放区是插在蒋匪心脏的一把利剑，各战场的胜利都与你们在大别山的艰苦斗争不可分，而我们在陇海、平汉沿线以及洛阳的胜利，尤其与你们的直接配合不可分。
    现在我们为了更有利的歼灭敌人，三大兵团会合在一起了。今后我们将更多更直接的协同作战，因此也有更多的机会学习你们的优良作风，特别学习你们灵活的战术和研究战术的精神，学习你们切实朴素和民主的工作作风和艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。今后我们将在党中央的正确路线和中原局的统一领导下，为巩固与建设中原解放区而共同努力。
    我们预祝共同的胜利和同志们的健康！
    敬礼！
    陈毅、粟裕、陈士渠、唐亮暨全体指战员
    　　　　　　　五月十五日
　　中原野战军的回信敬爱的同志们：
    我们首先应该向最亲密的战友——华东野战军的全体同志致以崇高的敬礼！对于你们的慰问，致以深切的谢意！
    爱国自卫战争的初期，我们与华东兵团相互配合最为密切，象左右手一样地打击敌人。你们在苏中的七战七捷，宿北大捷，鲁南大捷，莱芜大捷，孟良崮大捷等伟大胜利，为中国人民革命战争的历史写下了灿烂的一页，这些伟大的胜利，有力的鼓舞了我们的每一个指战员，你们担负了当时全国最重要的也是最艰巨的战线——华东战场。由于你们胜利的打破敌人的“重点进攻”，为我们当时的冀鲁豫战场创造了歼敌致胜的有利形势；你们这种顽强坚韧不怕艰险的英雄气概，是我们全体同志所敬仰的和必须学习的。
    去年大进攻，我们打到江淮河汉，直抵长江。三个兵团——华野兵团、陈谢兵团、和我们鼎足而立，互相呼应。你们掩护我们的战略突破，并歼灭了蒋匪五十七师，切断蒋介石内战大动脉——陇海路，便利了我们在大别山完成战略展开。正当敌人在大别山作垂死的挣扎，进行所谓“重点防御”的时候，你们和陈谢兵团发动平汉战役，歼灭了蒋匪第五兵团司令部和整三师，并给二十师以歼灭性打击。三军会师平汉，这给了我们以直接的帮助，这是我们坚持大别山斗争的每一同志所深深牢记而不能忘怀的。今天我们三大兵团并肩作战，给予大别山的帮助将更是重大的。我们已屹立在大别山上，毛主席授给我们的利剑已插进敌人的心脏，这一点是与你们的胜利战斗分不开的。在这里，我们特别代表坚持大别山斗争的全体同志，向你们致以战友的敬礼。
    现在我们三大兵团担负了解放全部江淮河汉的战略任务，使我们有更多的机会向你们学习。学习你们勇猛歼敌的战斗作风；学习你们注重调查研究缜密计划及时总结经验的科学态度；孜孜不息，提高军事艺术的精神；学习你们和陈谢兵团攻克洛阳之城市政策的模范；学习你们土改学习、三查、三整运动的经验；学习你们立功创模运动等政治工作的新创造和部队文化工作建设；更学习你们积极帮助友区部队的团结友爱精神。你们慰问团此来，不仅在政治上及文艺工作上给了我们部队许多教育和勉励，你们那种朝气勃勃，热情刻苦的工作作风，更使我们敬佩。
    三大兵团并肩携手，为现实毛主席的战略任务——解放全部中原而战！
    祝华东野战军全体同志健康！
    刘伯承、邓小平、李先念、张际春、李达、曾希圣暨中原野战军全体指战员
