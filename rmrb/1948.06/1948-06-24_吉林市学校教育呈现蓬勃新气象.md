Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: Since the liberation of Jilin City three months ago, school education has presented a vigorous new look. Jilin University officially resumed classes at the end of April, with over 500 students. Three specialized schools – industrial, vocational, and midwifery – have also been restored, each with over 300 students. There are three middle schools in the city: the United Senior High School with over 1,000 students, the United Junior High School with over 1,100 students, and the United Girls' High School with over 1,100 students. There are 45 public and private primary schools, one kindergarten, and two Korean primary schools. The total number of students in the city's universities, middle schools, and primary schools is over 27,600. Since the liberation of the city, due to the correct implementation of the New Democratic education policy and the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals by the democratic government, the suspicion and fear of the old teachers caused by the deception of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet secret agents were quickly dispelled, and the vast majority of the old teachers stayed at their posts. Of the original 323 teachers in the municipal primary schools, only 14 were dismissed, and only a very small number of clerks were laid off in the middle schools. The teachers in each school quickly settled down to work and further demanded to transform their thinking and learn new knowledge. At present, all primary school teachers in the city have gatherings every Saturday afternoon to listen to reports or collectively discuss various issues. Middle school teachers have organized teacher research associations. As a result of continuous and conscientious study, the teachers in each school have made great progress, and their work attitude has also undergone positive changes. For example, teachers at the United Junior High School used to be less concerned about everything at school, but now they can boldly put forward work opinions and improvement measures. Teacher absenteeism has almost disappeared. The injection-style teaching method has gradually changed, and the atmosphere of research discussion and collective learning is becoming increasingly strong, which greatly benefits the students and generally improves their interest in learning. For example, students at the United Senior High School initially had some absenteeism, but less than a month after the start of classes, a wave of learning competition was set off. In addition to the formal curriculum, the school also has research associations for fine arts and literature, as well as various other collective learning organizations. The students also used their holidays to form work teams to learn practical knowledge of industrial production in various factories, and at the same time, they taught workers to sing and learn to read. In order to read more new books, the students of the United Junior High School voluntarily spent money to buy books and set up class libraries. In addition to weekly learning review meetings, they also have extracurricular activities such as wall newspapers, Yangko dances, and dramas, making their learning life extremely active. Over 200 students from the United Senior High School have been admitted to medical universities, pharmaceutical colleges, the Northeast Academy of Sciences, and the Northeast Pictorial Fine Arts Training Class to study various specialized knowledge and technologies in preparation for participating in various construction works of New Democracy.

　　吉林市学校教育呈现蓬勃新气象
    【新华社东北十八日电】吉林市解放后三个月以来，学校教育呈现蓬勃的新气象。吉林大学于四月底正式复课，现有学生五百余人。工业、职业，及助产三个专科学校亦已恢复，各有学生三百余人。全市中学三所，计：联合高中有学生一千余人，联合初中有学生一千一百余人，联合女中有学生一千一百余人。公私立小学四十五所，另幼稚园一所及朝鲜小学两所。全市大中小学学生共两万七千六百余人。该市解放后，由于民主政府正确的执行了新民主主义教育方针及团结与改造知识分子的政策，很快地就解除了旧有教员因受蒋伪特务欺骗造成而发生的怀疑恐惧心理，绝大部分的旧有教员，都留校任职。市立小学原有三百廿三名教员中仅有十四名被免职，中学中则仅裁减极少数的事务员。各校教员都很快的安心工作，并进一步要求改造思想，学习新知识。目前全市小学教员每星期六下午皆有集会，听取报告，或集体讨论各种问题。中学教员则组织教员研究会。各校教员由于不断认真学习的结果，进步很大，工作态度亦有良好转变。如联合初中教员过去对学校一切都很少关心，现在已能大胆提出工作意见和改进办法。教员缺课现象已近绝迹。教学方法上注入式的教学已逐渐改变，研究讨论集体学习的空气日趋浓厚，学生得益很大，学习兴趣也普遍提高。如联合高中学生最初尚有缺课现象，但开课不到一个月即掀起学习竞赛热潮。该校除正式课程外，并有美术文艺等研究会及其他的各种集体学习组织。同学们并利用假期成立工作队到各工厂学习工业生产上的实际知识，同时，教工人唱歌认字。联合初中同学为能读到更多的新书，均自动出钱买书成立班图书室。他们每星期除有学习检讨会外，并有壁报、秧歌、戏剧等课外活动，学习生活极形活跃。联合高中已有二百余同学考入医大、药专、东北科学院及东北画报美术训练班，学习各种专门知识与技术，准备参加新民主主义的各种建设工作。
