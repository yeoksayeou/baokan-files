Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The newly appointed President of Czechoslovakia, Klement Gottwald, is the chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. He has made great contributions to the growth of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, to the struggle of the Czech and Slovak people against Hitlerite Fascism, and to the establishment and growth of the Czechoslovak People's Republic.

Gottwald was born in 1896, the son of a farmer, and worked as a carpenter. Since the establishment of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1921, Gottwald abandoned his carpentry profession to devote himself fully to professional revolutionary activities and became an outstanding cadre of the Party. In 1925, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee by the Party's Third National Congress. In 1926, he served as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee. Under Gottwald's leadership, the Party's Fifth National Congress defeated revisionism and opportunism within the Party, and Gottwald was unanimously elected as the General Secretary by the Congress.

When the European fascist aggressors began to stir, Gottwald called on the working class to repel the fascist offensive with unified slogans and actions. In 1935, at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, he and Dimitrov jointly drafted the program of the People's Front, making it the foundation for concentrating democratic forces to resist Fascism.

In 1938, after Czechoslovakia was betrayed by the Munich Agreement, Gottwald immediately organized the entire Party to go underground. In November, Gottwald went to Moscow on the orders of the Party Central Committee, where he directed the Czech national liberation movement at home and abroad.

In April 1945, the first cabinet after the liberation of Czechoslovakia was formed, and Gottwald served as Deputy Prime Minister. In May 1946, the Czech Communist Party won 38 percent of the vote in the first post-war general election, becoming the largest party in Czechoslovakia, and Gottwald became the Prime Minister of the cabinet. Under his leadership, Czechoslovakia implemented land reform and the nationalization of industry, and formulated and implemented the Two-Year Plan. In February of this year, when the Czech reactionaries, with the support of American and British imperialism, conspired to restore and betray the country, the Czech people, under his wise and decisive leadership, quickly established a new people's democratic National Front, effectively defeating the reactionaries' conspiracy.

　　哥特瓦尔德略传
    【新华社陕北十八日电】新任捷克总统克里门特·哥特瓦尔德，是捷克共产党的主席。他对于捷克共产党的成长壮大，对于捷克与斯洛伐克人民反希特勒法西斯的斗争，对于捷克斯拉夫人民共和国的建立和成长，都有伟大的贡献。
    哥特瓦尔德生于一八九六年，系农家之子，出身木匠。自捷克共产党于一九二一年成立以后，哥特瓦尔德就放弃了木匠的职业，以全力从事职业的革命活动，并成为党的优秀干部。一九二五年，他被党的第三次代表大会选为中央委员。一九二六年，任党的中央宣传部长。党的第五次代表大会在哥氏的领导下，战胜了党内的改良主义与机会主义，哥氏被大会全体一致地选为总书记。
    当欧洲法西斯侵略者开始蠢动之时，哥氏就号召工人阶级以统一的口号与行动击退法西斯的进攻。一九三五年，在共产国际第七次大会上，他与季米特洛夫共同拟定了人民阵线的纲领，使之成为集中民主力量抗击法西斯的基础。
    一九三八年，当捷克被慕尼黑会议出卖以后，哥特瓦尔德立即组织全党转入地下工作。十一月，哥氏奉党中央之命赴莫斯科，在那里指挥国内外的捷克民族解放运动。
    一九四五年四月，捷克解放后的第一届内阁成立，哥氏出任副总理。一九四六年五月，捷共在战后第一次大选中获选票百分之三十八，成为捷克第一大党，哥氏遂出任内阁总理。在他的领导之下，捷克实行了土地改革和工业国有化，拟订并实行了二年计划。今年二月，当捷克反动派在美英帝国主义支持下，阴谋复辟叛卖国家之时，捷克人民在他英明果断的领导下，迅速成立了新的人民民主的民族阵线，有力的击败了反动派的阴谋。
