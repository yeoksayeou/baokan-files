Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: Industries in Tianjin continue to close. The city has been affected by the dumping of American goods for years. By the middle of last month, only fourteen factories, including Fuxing and Mingxing, were barely surviving. Among them, Welfare and Dahua factories were preparing to shut down. The cattle industry in the city now has 1,100 dairy cows, a decrease of almost half compared to the 2,000 cows two years ago. The increasingly numerous and heavy taxes levied by the Chiang Kai-shek government are severely oppressing private industries. At the beginning of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities again raised the city's "37th Year Spring Business Tax Collection Standard," stipulating adjustments according to the new tax rate. The rate for food grains (including mills and flour mills) increased by 4.3 times, other foods such as oil increased by 3.8 times, sauce shops, noodles, dried and fresh goods, and tea increased by 4 times, and the fuel industry also increased by 3.2 times. The city's Cigarette Industry Association, due to the heavy cigarette tax imposed by Chiang Kai-shek, which was unbearable, petitioned and protested to the Chiang Kai-shek Goods Tax Bureau again at the beginning of last month. In other news: Due to the monopoly and unified control of raw cotton by the Chiang Kai-shek Flower and Cotton Fabric Management Committee and the China Textile Company, the Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory is also facing a shutdown crisis. As of the beginning of last month, the factory had only 9,000 dan of raw cotton left, which could only last for one and a half months, while the amount of raw cotton purchased each month was only two-tenths of what was needed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Shanghai newspaper news: Due to Chiang Kai-shek's frantic plunder and constant price fluctuations, more and more industries in Shanghai are closing, suspending operations, and reducing production. Among the 29 match factories in Shanghai and Suzhou, 10 have suspended work. Among them, Huaxin and Guohua factories have officially announced their closure, and Minsheng and Jiufu factories have been sold. The current selling price of each box of matches is 13-14 million yuan, but with the addition of heavy taxes, the cost reaches 16 million yuan, resulting in huge losses for each factory. 30% of the dyeing and weaving factories in the city have reduced working hours, and more textile factories are semi-stopped due to the cost being 10% higher than the market price. Soap factories, which used to be in their peak season in late spring and early summer, now have two-thirds of them shut down. Even the rubber industry, which previously had better prospects, has seen 30% of factories announce closures in the past month, and the other 70% have also reduced production. Large factories such as Wai Zhonghua and Zhengtai only operate for three or four days a month. Other industries such as machinery, textiles, leather making, and glass are all generally feeling difficult to maintain. According to statistics from the Department Store Association, 10 members apply to withdraw from the association each month, and new members have long since disappeared.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The Chiang-controlled areas are frantically increasing various taxes and intensifying the plunder of the people, hoping to alleviate the increasingly rising financial difficulties. The Chiang Kai-shek government recently stipulated that an additional so-called "Pacification and National Reconstruction Fee" be levied on Sichuan salt, amounting to 100,000 yuan per dan, totaling nearly 1 trillion yuan. The Taiwan Chiang Provincial Government also stipulated that from April 30th, all goods entering and leaving the province's ports would be subject to a "port tax" of 1.5% of the cargo value. The Chiang authorities in Changshu, Jiangsu, have begun to levy a "River Defense Fee" on passing vehicles and ships, with cargo trucks paying 1.2 million yuan per vehicle, ships over 20 tons paying 500,000 yuan per ship, ships between 10 and 20 tons paying 200,000 yuan, and ships under 10 tons paying 120,000 yuan, etc. The Wuchang Chiang Party "Pacification Committee" also started collecting a so-called "National Defense Engineering Donation" on April 8th, dividing all households into three classes, A, B, and C, and forcibly levying tens of thousands of yuan according to the class, while shops are levied according to their business situation. Merchants and traders have suffered heavy blows under the heavy taxes and extortion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. For example, when a pig is transported from the producing area north of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, the various taxes, such as "Self-Defense Special Donation," "Pacification Special Donation," and "Slaughter Tax," amount to more than 1 million yuan by the time it reaches the retail butcher, and this does not include the "Business Tax," "Income Tax," "Stamp Tax," and temporary additional taxes.

　　沪津工商业倒闭日多
  　火柴肥皂纺织各业无不蚀本减产
    【新华社陕北三日电】据蒋区报纸消息：天津工商各业继续倒闭。该市因连年遭受美货倾销影响，至上月中旬工厂仅剩福星、明星等十四家勉强支持，且其中福利、大华两厂均已准备休业。牛场业全市现剩乳牛一千一百头，较之两年前的二千头，几已减少一倍。蒋匪政府日益增多的苛捐杂税，极端压迫着民营工商各业，上月初蒋匪当局再度提高该市“三十七年度春季营业税征收标准”，规定按照新税率调整。计食粮类（包括磨坊及面粉厂）增加四点三倍，其他食物如油业等，增加三点八倍，酱园、面食、干鲜物、茶等业为四倍，燃料业亦增三点二倍。该市卷烟业同业公会即因蒋匪卷烟税苛重，不堪负担，曾于上月初再度向蒋匪货物税局请愿并抗议。另息：因蒋匪花纱布管理委员会和中纺公司对原棉的垄断统制，唐山华新纱厂亦已面临停工危机。截至上月初，该厂所剩原棉仅有九千担，只能维持一个半月之用，而每月所购原棉则仅是十分之二。
    【新华社陕北一日电】沪报消息：由于蒋匪疯狂搜刮及物价不断波动，沪市工商各业近来倒闭、停业、减产者日多。上海和苏州的二十九家火柴厂中停工的已有十家，其中华鑫及国华两厂正式宣告停闭，民生九福两厂均已出售，现火柴每箱售价一千三四百万元，但加上繁苛的捐税，成本即达一千六百万，各厂因此亏蚀甚大。全市染织业各厂减工者，达百分之三十，纺织业各厂因成本与市价相差一成，半停工者更多。肥皂厂在往年春末夏初正值旺季，现在停工者也达三分之二，即连以前景况较好之橡胶工业，一月来宣告停工者亦达三成，其他七成亦减产。如规模较大之外中华、正泰等厂，每月仅开三四天工，其他各机器、纺织、制革、玻璃等工业，无不普遍感觉难以维持。据百货业公会统计，该会会员申请退会的每月达十家，入会的则久已绝迹。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据蒋区报纸消息：蒋区正疯狂增加各种捐税，加紧向人民掠夺，冀以减轻日益增涨中的财政困难。蒋记政府最近又规定川盐加收所谓“戡乱建国费”，计每担蒋币达十万元，全数约近一万亿元之巨。台湾蒋省府亦规定自四月三十日起，进出该省各港口的货物，一律按照货价千分之十五加收“港口捐”。江苏常熟蒋当局，则已开始向过往车辆、船只增收“防江费”，计货车每辆须缴捐一百二十万元，二十吨以上船只每艘五十万元，十吨以上二十万元，十吨以下十二万元等。武昌蒋党“戡乱委员会”亦于四月八日起，征收所谓“国防工程捐”，将所有住户划分甲乙丙三等分居，依等级强迫勒收数十万元不等，各商店则按营业情形勒收。货贩客商在蒋匪重税勒索之下，均蒙受惨重打击。如一只猪自长江以北产地运往上海，至肉商零售时止，仅付出各种税，如“自卫特捐”、“绥靖特捐”、“屠宰税”等项，即达一百万元之多，而“营业税”、“所得税”、“印花税”及临时增加的捐税，尚不计在内。
