　　Production Snippets
  　Huolu Shiqiao Farmers Cooperate Well
  　Renxian Fourth District Masses Busy Reclaiming Wasteland
    In Shiqiao Village, Huolu Eighth District, 270 households received floating property this time. Ninety-six households received 36 mules and 7 donkeys. One hundred and twenty-one households received 22 waterwheels, naturally forming dozens of labor production groups. They helped each other and overcame many difficulties. Han Lulu and other four poor households received a mule with a bad temper that they couldn't use, so they found Li Laifu, a middle peasant in the village who knew how to handle livestock, to join the group. Li Laifu drove the livestock to plow the fields for everyone, and everyone paid him for his labor accordingly. After Li Xiuchang from Li Laifu's group joined the army, there was no one at home to use the livestock, and they couldn't afford fodder. The group discussed allowing his family to use the livestock without having to pay for feed, and they would provide the straw after the autumn harvest. The group agreed that the livestock would be managed by group member Li Shunfu, who could also use it for transportation and sales in his spare time, saving money to solve the fodder problem. Not only did these four households complete plowing and sowing all their land, but they also hauled three trips of coal from Yangquan, bought five to six hundred catties of grass, and replaced the cart axles with plow axles.
    After several rounds of propaganda and explanation of the Land Law and the "Whoever Plants, Whoever Harvests" proclamation of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government by the Renxian Fourth District County and District authorities, the cadres and masses understood the Party's policies, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Many farmers even dug up ridges and irrigated their wheat with rainwater, which they had planned not to water. Wu Chunchang, the village chief of Wu Yue Village, said: "This time, we can harvest an extra dou of wheat per mu. We will no longer listen to rumors and be fooled by bad people in the future." After the special commissioner's office announced that no burden would be levied for five years on reclaimed wasteland, and the county stipulated that no burden would be levied this year on reclaimed cultivated land reclaimed in 1934, the masses' enthusiasm for production and reclamation was very high. After the government's production loans were issued, everyone automatically organized themselves. Xu Beizhang mutually bought six head of cattle, and in addition to planting their original land, they reclaimed 120 mu of wasteland, which has now been planted. The seedlings that were originally planted have been hoeed twice, and most have been watered once (well irrigation). Dong Gengzhuang reclaimed 150 mu of cultivated wasteland, and Sha Ying mutually bought five head of cattle, reclaiming 80 mu of wasteland.

    Eliminate "White Wave" Land
  　Increase Production by Topdressing
    After the correction of deviations and consolidation in Xiajin Seventh District, the emotions of all classes have stabilized, and production is of utmost importance. For example, Sun Huachang, a middle peasant in Huayuan, automatically hoed the land for others after being compensated for the wrong struggle, and even allowed others to cut wheat for him in exchange for livestock to plow and irrigate the land. The village has more than 400 mu of "white wave" land in the west, which has been flooded for two consecutive years due to the low-lying terrain. Now the water has just receded. In order to increase production, the masses proposed to eliminate the waterlogged "white wave" land before the wheat harvest. Wang Qingling was so busy plowing the land that he was unwilling to grind flour and ate sticky porridge for several days. With everyone's active efforts, all the land has been planted in seven or eight days. In Jiankou Village, 200 head of cattle are plowing the "white wave" land every day. The village has now been mostly sown. While the men are busy plowing and sowing the "white wave" land, many women in the village are participating in hoeing seedlings.
    　　（County Committee Office）
    In Xichuan Village, Huguan Third District, people's hearts have settled after the correction of deviations, and they are boldly engaging in production and breeding. Ma Jinwang fertilized one mu of "Golden Queen" corn with 80 loads of fertilizer first, plowed it once, used 20 loads of fertilizer to dig holes for planting, and now topdressed it with another 50 loads of fertilizer. Under their influence, a total of 2,729 loads of fertilizer were topdressed on 41 mu of "Golden Queen" corn in the whole village, an average of 66 loads per mu. The land has now been hoeed once, and the plan is to hoe it three times to strive for more grain in the autumn.

    Xingtai Dongguangxian After Extraction and Replenishment
  　Complete Wheat Harvest and Sowing in Nine Days
    Dongguangxian Village, Xingtai Third District, completed the extraction and replenishment work in May (Gregorian calendar). On June 1st, a mass meeting of the whole village (including landlords and rich peasants) was held to mobilize how to organize and carry out production, emphasizing that the land will no longer be changed in the future, and the land ownership certificates will be issued soon. The government guarantees our land ownership, and everyone should settle down to production and become rich. Pointing out to the landlords that they should transform themselves through production, everyone was very happy at the meeting, saying that the extraction and replenishment work was completed just in time for the wheat harvest, and nothing was delayed. Based on the village's situation, there are many people working outside, and there is a shortage of male labor, so it is necessary to organize to complete the wheat harvest and sowing work. After the meeting, 46 groups (mostly mutual aid and labor exchange) were voluntarily formed in one and a half days, completing the harvest of 3956.526 mu and sowing 4239.17 mu in nine days. During the wheat harvest and sowing, the masses were in high spirits, and there was not a single idle person in the village. After the rain on the 6th, the 152 mu of seed land stored by the peasant association was distributed for planting. Before the distribution, the cadres thought that there was a shortage of labor and it could not be distributed, but when it was distributed, everyone scrambled for it.

  　Zuoquan Sucheng Unite in Production
  　Women and Children Participate in Weeding
    Sucheng Village, Zuoquan, is a land reform experimental village. During the extraction and replenishment process, attention was paid to resolving various ideological concerns and implementing the policy of unity in production. In addition, 20 dan of grain were distributed from the granary to solve the livelihood problems of households that were wrongly struggled against and to settle the living materials of landlords and rich peasants. Sowing was completed in half a month. All 3,600 mu of land in the village have caught seedlings, and they are growing very well. The masses said: "Our village has not missed the work of extracting and replenishing or production this year." After June 3rd, a campaign to weed seedlings was launched, and children and women actively participated.

　　生产零讯
  　获鹿石桥农民互助好
  　任县四区群众开荒忙
    获鹿八区石桥村二百七十户人家，这次分浮财，有九十六户伙分了三十六头骡子，七头驴。一百二十一户伙分了二十二辆水车，如此自然形成了数十个拨工生产小组。他们互助互让克服了好多困难。韩洛禄等四户贫农分了一个脾气暴的骡子使用不了，便找本村会捉弄牲口的中农李来福入了股，来福赶牲口给大伙耕地，大伙照数还他工。李来福组里的李修昌参军后，家中没有人能使牲口，又供不起草料，小组里商量可叫他家只管使，不要管喂，等秋收后把谷草拿出来即行了。该组商妥牲口由组员李顺福管理，闲时并可作运销，省钱解决草料。该四户不但把地全耕播完了、并且又去阳泉拉了三趟煤，买下五六百斤草，大车也换上耕轴。
    任县四区经县区几次宣传解释土地法及晋冀鲁豫边区政府谁种谁收的布告，干部群众了解了我党的政策，生产情绪大大提高，不少农民把打算不浇的麦子也扒起畦堰浇了雨水。吴岳村村长吴春常说：这次每亩能多收一斗麦子，咱们今后不再听谣言上坏人的当了。又经专署公布开生荒五年不纳负担，县里规定三十四年开的熟荒今年不纳负担后，群众生产开荒的劲头都很大。政府生产贷款发放后，都自动组织起来。许北张互助买耕牛六头，除将原种地种上外，开荒一百二十亩，现已种上。把原先种的苗都锄了两遍，大部分都浇了一水（井浇）。东耿庄开熟荒一百五十亩，沙营互助买耕牛五头，开生荒八十亩。

    消灭白波地
  　增产上追肥
    夏津七区纠编后，各阶层情绪稳定，生产到头大。如花园错斗的中农孙华昌补偿后，自动给别人锄地，还允许给别人割麦子，来换牲口耕水浇地。该村村西有四百多亩白波地，因地洼连淹了二年，现水才落下去，群众为了增产，提出麦收前突击消灭白波地水淹地。王清岭忙着耕地不愿磨面，吃了好几天的黏粥，在大家积极忙碌下，七八天的工夫已全部种上。箭口村每天在白波地里耕地的有二百头牛。该村现己大部耩上，在男的忙着耕耩白波地的时候，该村有很多妇女参加锄苗。
    　　（县委会办公室）
    壶关三区西川村，经过纠偏，人心安定，放手生产闹开养种，马金旺种“金皇后”玉茭一亩先上施肥八十担、耕了一犁、用了二十担刨窑是种现下又上追肥五十担。在他们的影响下，全村四十一亩金皇后共上追肥二千七百二十九担，每亩平均上追肥六十六担。现已普遍锄过一遍，计划锄三锄，争取秋后多打粮。

    邢台东光贤抽补后
  　九天完成麦收下种
    邢台三区东光贤村于五月属（阳历）完成抽补工作，六月一日开全村群众大会（地主富农在内）动员如何组织起来进行生产，着重说明今后的土地不再变动，很快就发下土地所有证，政府保证咱们的土地所有权，大家要安心生产发家致富。向地主指出在生产中改造自己，会上大家都很高兴，说抽补完了正赶收麦，都不耽误。根据本村的情况，在外的人很多，男劳力少必须组织起来才能完成收麦下种工作。会后在一天半的时间内，自愿结合了四十六个组（多保变工），九天内完成收三九五六、五二六亩，下种四二三九·一七亩。在麦收下种时，群众情绪高涨，全村没有一个闲人。六日下雨后，把农会存的一五二亩寄种地分配下去寄种。未分时，干部认为缺劳力，分不下去，但分时都争着要。

  　左权粟城团结生产
  　妇女儿童参加锄苗
    左权粟城村，是个土改实验村，在抽补中，注意解决各种思想顾虑，贯彻团结生产政策兼之发放仓谷二十石，解决了错斗户和安置了地富生活资料，在半月内完成了下种。全村三千六百亩地，都捉住了苗，且长得很好，群众说：咱们村在今年又抽补又生产工夫都没有误了。六月三号以后开始突击锄苗，儿童妇女积极参加。
