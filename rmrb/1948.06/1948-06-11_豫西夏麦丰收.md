Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei, 7th: Western Henan has had an abundant summer wheat harvest, and farmers have begun reaping. This spring, the rainfall was well-distributed, and the wheat seedlings in the vast summer fields of Western Henan were extremely vigorous. Before the Grain in Ear period, there was another heavy rain, which accelerated the ripening of the wheat. The military region and administrative office have issued orders to all areas to fully protect and help the people harvest wheat. According to veteran farmers, this year's wheat is growing better than in the past few years, with dense wheat stalks, large ears of wheat, and plump grains. It is estimated that the average yield per mu is about 200 jin (5 dou), and the yield per mu in mountainous areas is about 120 jin (about 3 dou).
