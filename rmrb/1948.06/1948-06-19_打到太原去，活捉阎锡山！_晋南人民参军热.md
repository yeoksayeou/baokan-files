Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th. "Down with Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!" This is the slogan of the broad masses in southern Shanxi who are enthusiastically joining the army after the liberation of Linfen. Peasants who have been emancipated after the land reform in various places are joining the People's Liberation Army in groups. In Pingchuan, Jishan County, more than 370 people signed up for the army in three days. Li Wenye, chairman of the Women's Association of Macun, said at a cadre meeting: "My husband was killed by Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan is a public enemy hated by everyone in Shanxi. I have three sons, and the two older ones have already joined the People's Liberation Army. Today I will also persuade my brother to join the army." In Ningzhai Village, the three Guo Si'er brothers, the eldest has been in the People's Liberation Army for some time, and now the second and third are vying to go. More than 300 militiamen organized during the land reform in Xinjiang County all signed up to join the army. In the Second District of the county, after eight Communist Party members took the lead in signing up for the army, 57 people responded immediately. Everyone made a plan to perform meritorious service for the people. Communist Party member He Lai Suo said: He joined the army not only to defend his own fruits of emancipation, but also to help the oppressed masses in the KMT-controlled areas to emancipate themselves. At the conscription meeting in Wan'an Village, Hong Zhao County (newly established county, parts of Hongdong and Zhaocheng), the masses fired cannons to pay tribute to the glorious young men who joined the army and their families, and women rushed to make shirts, shoes, socks and other comfort items. Recently, sixteen newly liberated Yan Xishan soldiers who were sent home by the Linfen Democratic Government were moved by the enthusiastic scene of the people in the liberated areas joining the army, and also asked the Democratic Government to join the People's Liberation Army.

　　“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山！”
  　晋南人民参军热
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山!”这是晋南广大群众在临汾解放后踊跃参军的口号，各地土改后的翻身农民，成群结伙投入解放军。稷山县平川三天中有三百七十余人报名入伍。马村妇女会主席李文叶在干部会上说：“我的丈夫给阎锡山杀死。阎锡山是山西人人痛恨的公敌。我有三个儿子，两个大的已参加了解放军。今天我还要劝说我兄弟参军去。”宁翟村郭四儿兄弟三人，老大早在解放军，现在老二老三又争着要去。新绛县土改中组织的民兵基干队三百余人全部报名参军。该县二区在八个共产党员首先报名参军后，随即有五十七个人响应。每人都订下为人民立功的计划。共产党员贺来锁说：他参军不但只为了保卫自己的翻身果实，还要帮助蒋管区被压迫的群众翻身。洪赵县（新设县。洪洞赵城各一部）万安村的参军大会上，群众向光荣参军的青年及其家属鸣炮致敬，妇女们赶做衬衣、鞋、袜等慰劳品。最近为临汾民主政府遣送回家的十六个刚获解放的阎军士兵，被解放区人民参军的热烈场面所感动，也向民主政府要求参加解放军。
