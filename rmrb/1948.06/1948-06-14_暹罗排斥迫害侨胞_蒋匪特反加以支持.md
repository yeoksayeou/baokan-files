Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Bangkok News: The overseas Chinese in Siam, estimated to be a quarter of the population, numbering three to four million, are now facing the threat of anti-Chinese atrocities by the fascist war criminal Luang Phibuns government. Encouraged by U.S. imperialism, Luang Phibuns, an accomplice of the Japanese invaders during the war, launched a military coup on November 8th last year, and since his re-emergence on April 16th this year, he has been plotting to re-implement the anti-Chinese atrocities of the war. On May 1st, with the support of the Siamese authorities, a "Thai Labor Federation" was established, declaring that it would seize jobs from Chinese workers. On May 7th, so-called "Black Ivory" anti-Chinese slogans appeared in Bangkok, clamoring to destroy the shops of our overseas Chinese compatriots and prohibit Chinese from entering the country. The business of overseas Chinese merchants and vendors has now been subjected to various threats and persecutions. On May 12th, the Ministry of Education, headed by fascist military officer Lieutenant General Luang Phrom Yothi, also announced an anti-Chinese "Private School Ordinance," restricting the number of overseas Chinese schools and forcibly reducing the existing 490 overseas Chinese schools to 148. On May 15th, the three major overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok (with over 10,000 students) were ordered to close, and more than 30 other overseas Chinese schools in Bangkok were closed on the pretext of "not strictly adhering to" the registration regulations promulgated by the Siamese Ministry of Education. By the end of May, a total of 200,000 overseas Chinese students throughout Siam had been effectively deprived of schooling due to this anti-Chinese decree, and 3,000 teachers were unemployed as a result. Unless overseas Chinese students continue to be deprived of schooling, they will have no choice but to accept the fascist anti-Chinese education of Luang Phibuns' reactionary government. As for the remaining overseas Chinese schools, their teachers must also be tested by the Ministry of Education of Luang Phibuns' government, and Chinese language teachers must hold diplomas from the Nanjing Ministry of Education. In the future, the time for overseas Chinese children to learn Chinese in overseas Chinese schools will also be limited to five hours per week. Bangkok opinion believes that Luang Phibuns' reactionary measures to exclude overseas Chinese schools are part of his entire plan to plunder overseas Chinese and undermine the democratic movement in Siam. The next possible step will be to restrict overseas Chinese newspapers and overseas Chinese organizations. In this conspiracy, Luang Phibuns is receiving assistance from Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies. After the incident of restricting overseas Chinese schools occurred, the Nanjing embassy in Siam and secret service agencies colluded with the Luang Phibuns authorities under the superficial smoke screen of "protest," jointly destroying overseas Chinese schools in an attempt to bring the remaining overseas Chinese schools under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　暹罗排斥迫害侨胞
  　蒋匪特反加以支持
    【新华社陕北十日电】曼谷消息：估暹罗人口四分之一、数达三四百万的华侨，现在又面临罗人口四法西斯战犯銮披汶政府排华暴行的威胁。在美帝国主义鼓励下，战时日寇帮凶銮披汶于去年十一月八日发动军事政变，并于今年四月十六日再度登台以来，即阴谋重施战时之排华暴政。五月一日在暹罗当局支持下，成立了一个“泰国劳工联合会”，声言将由华侨工人手中夺回工作。五月七日，曼谷城内出现所谓“黑象牙”会之排华标语，叫嚣捣毁我侨胞之商店及禁止华胞入境，华侨商贩营业现已受到种种威胁和迫害。五月十二日，法西斯军人銮普伦育特赫中将掌管的教育部，又公布一排华的“民校条例”，限制华侨学校数目，强令侨校自现有的四百九十所削减至一百四十八所。五月十五日，曼谷三大侨校（学生万余人）被勒令停闭，曼谷其他侨校在“未严守”暹教部所颁登记规程的借口之下，被封闭者达三十余所。迄五月底止，全暹各地侨胞学童，因此项排华法令而遭实际失学者已达二十万人，教师因此赋闲者三千人。侨胞学童除非继续失学，即不得不转受銮披汶反动政府之法西斯排华教育。至于残留的侨校，其师资亦须受銮披汶政府教部之测验，其中国语教师并须持有南京教育部之文凭。今后侨胞子弟在侨校学习国语之时间，亦被限制为每周五小时。曼谷舆论界相信：銮披汶此次排斥侨校之反动措施，乃其整个劫掠华侨，摧残暹罗民主运动计划之一部分，其下一可能步骤即将为限制侨胞报纸及侨胞团体。在这一阴谋计划中，銮披汶受到蒋介石特务机关的援助。限制侨校事件发生后，南京驻暹使馆及特务机关即在表面“抗议”的烟幕下，与銮披汶当局勾结，共同摧残侨校，企图使残留的侨校统归国民党反动派所控制。
