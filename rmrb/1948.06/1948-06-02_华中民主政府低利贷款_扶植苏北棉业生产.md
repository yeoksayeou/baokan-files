Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th: The Central China Democratic Government is vigorously supporting cotton production in the Subei (Northern Jiangsu) cotton reclamation area. The Cotton Field Improvement Institute, established by the Lifeng Cotton Reclamation Company, has provided 350,000 catties of carefully selected, high-quality cotton seeds, interest-free, in Dazhongji, Dongtai County. Among these, 40,000 catties of the best "De" variety cotton seeds have been distributed to Jin Feng and other two townships with better soil quality for experimentation, in order to promote cotton production improvement. The institute has also established a farm in Dazhongji to promote strip planting methods, as strip planting saves labor compared to broadcast sowing and can increase yields. The implement research department of the institute has successfully tested a strip seeder, which will be first used in the summer cultivation. The second phase of agricultural loans for Dongtai and Tai Bei (newly established Dongtai Bei county) counties, amounting to 227.7 million Central China currency, has been issued, mainly to solve production difficulties in the cotton reclamation area. Tai Bei county plans to restore cotton fields to 350,000 mu, producing 250,000 dan of cotton. The coastal cotton reclamation area of Yancheng-Funing region originally had 280,000 mu of cotton fields, with abundant cotton production. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the successive destruction of seawalls by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, as well as the disrepair of river courses over the years, the area has suffered repeated floods, and cotton production has decreased. For example, Funing East County (newly established) previously produced 60 jin of cotton per mu, but now only produces 15 jin. To address this, the Yancheng-Funing Special District Office and the Reclamation Bureau have allocated 486.3 million Central China currency to rebuild river embankments. Currently, 52 li of the Yu Mian River and 12 li of the Da Laba River have been dredged, and repairs have begun on over 100 li of river embankments from Tao Zi River mouth to Sheyang River. At the same time, 480,000 jin of cotton seeds and 14,400 pieces of agricultural implements such as hoes have been distributed to help organize and regulate plowing cattle to ensure timely sowing.

  　扶植苏北棉业生产
    【新华社华东三十日电】华中民主政府大力扶植苏北棉垦区棉业生产。利丰棉垦公司所设之棉田改进所，在东台县大中集无利贷出精选优良棉种三十五万斤，其中以最好的德字棉种四万斤发放在土质较好的晋丰等两乡，进行实验，以便推广棉产改进所。并在大中集设立农场传播条播种植法，因条播较散种节省人工，并能增加产量。该所农具研究部已将条播器试验成功，夏耕中即将首先应用。东台、台北（东台北新设县）两县第二期农贷华中币二亿二千七百七十万元已发放，主要解决棉垦区生产困难。台北棉田计划恢复到三十五万亩，产棉二十五万担。盐阜地区沿海棉垦区原有棉田二十八万亩，棉产甚丰，但抗战迄今，由于海堤先后遭日寇蒋匪破坏以及河道年久失修，因此迭遭水患，棉产减少。例如阜（宁）东县（新设县）以前每亩产棉六十斤，现只产十五斤，为此盐阜专署及垦务局拨款华中币四亿八千六百三十万元，重整河堤，现已疏浚长五十二里之远棉河及十二里长之大喇叭河，并开始修理套子河口至射阳河百余里长之河堤。同时发放棉种四十八万斤及锄头等农具一万四千四百件，帮助组织调剂耕牛保证及时下种。
