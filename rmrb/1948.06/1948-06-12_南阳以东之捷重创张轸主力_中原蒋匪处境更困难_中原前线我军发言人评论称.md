　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 9th: A spokesperson for the Central Plains Front Headquarters spoke to reporters regarding the annihilation of over 8,000 enemy troops east of Nanyang. He stated: This campaign, which began on May 29th and concluded on June 2nd, lasted five days and resulted in the elimination of over 8,000 troops from Zhang Zhen's army group. If we include the results of our army's simultaneous obstruction of Chiang Kai-shek's 18th Army in the Luohe area, where over 1,000 enemy troops were annihilated, the total reaches 10,000. This is another heavy blow dealt to Chiang Kai-shek. The course of this campaign was as follows: After our army's great victory in western Wan, annihilating 10,000 enemy troops in early May, and then capturing the strategically important town of Laohekou on the 17th, eliminating 4,000 enemy troops, Nanyang and Xiangfan became extremely precarious. Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi urgently ordered Zhang Zhen, the director of the Xinyang Pacification Zone, to personally lead the 10th Division, 20th Division, and 58th Division, among others, to rush to western Wan for reinforcement. This timid general, Zhang Zhen, advanced at a speed of 20 to 30 li per day, taking ten days and nights to finally reach Nanyang. By that time, our army had already victoriously completed the western Wan operation and was resting. Thereupon, Zhang Zhen became bold and conducted several days of unimpeded parades in the Zhenping and Neixiang areas, followed by announcing his illustrious achievements. However, at that very moment, another unit of our army suddenly appeared on the Pinghan Railway. On the 26th, they occupied Zhumadian, and on the 27th, they approached Queshan, threatening Xinyang, which had an empty defense. In a panic, Bai Chongxi ordered Zhang Zhen to lead his three divisions back to reinforce Queshan. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, just as they reached the area south of Sheqi Town, about 80 li east of Nanyang, they were suddenly attacked by our powerful forces. After two days of fierce fighting, suffering over 1,000 casualties, they fled westward in disarray on the 31st. Our army seized the opportunity to pursue vigorously, and at dawn on the 1st of this month, intercepted and surrounded the enemy's 58th Division headquarters and the main force of its 183rd Brigade, totaling over 5,000 troops, in the Maliuying, Lianzhuang, and Hanzhuang areas, about 30 li east of Nanyang, and completely annihilated them on the night of the 2nd. During this period, Zhang Zhen personally led the 10th Division, 20th Division, and the 9th Division stationed in Nanyang to make several all-out attempts to reinforce, but they were all repelled by our army, with enemy casualties and prisoners reaching over 2,000. Zhang Zhen's troops, after being continuously intercepted by our army, fled in panic like stray dogs, reaching the outskirts of Nanyang on the morning of the 3rd. Our army is now advancing towards Nanyang in victory. While our army was encircling and annihilating Zhang Zhen's troops, Chiang Kai-shek strictly ordered the 18th Army to reinforce southward from Xuchang, but they were obstructed by our powerful forces in the Luohe area. For five days and five nights, they advanced no more than 30 li, with casualties and prisoners exceeding 1,000. The tenacious strikes of our Luohe forces played a direct and powerful role in guaranteeing the victory east of Nanyang. The spokesperson continued: The mobile forces that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits maintained in the Central Plains battlefield were already not numerous, and in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, there were only the 18th Army and Zhang Zhen's three divisions: the 10th Division, 20th Division, and 58th Division. After this campaign, the main force of the 58th Division has been annihilated, and the 10th and 20th Divisions have also suffered heavy losses, making it difficult for them to recover their strength in the short term. This situation, in the face of the increasingly powerful offensives of the People's Liberation Army, will place Chiang Kai-shek's already strained and hard-pressed military situation in the Central Plains in an even more difficult position.

### 南阳以东之捷重创张轸主力　中原蒋匪处境更困难  中原前线我军发言人评论称

　　南阳以东之捷重创张轸主力
  　中原蒋匪处境更困难
    中原前线我军发言人评论称
    【新华社中原前线九日电】中原前线司令部发言人顷对记者谈此次南阳以东歼敌八千余人的经过称：此次战役从五月二十九日开始，到六月二日结束，历时五天，共歼张轸兵团八千余人。如果把我军同时在漯河地区阻击蒋匪十八军，歼敌千余的战果计算在内，则达万人。这是我解放军给予蒋贼的又一次沉重的打击。这次战役的经过，是当我军五月上旬宛西大捷歼敌万人，十七日占领军事重镇老河口歼敌四千后，南阳、襄樊异常危急，蒋介石、白崇禧急令信阳绥区主任张轸亲率十师、二十师、五十八师等三个师，赶赴宛西增援。张轸这位胆小的将军，以每日二十里至三十里的速度，化了十天十夜，终于赶到了南阳。其时，我军早已胜利完成宛西作战，按兵休息了。于是张轸胆大起来，在镇平、内乡地区作了几天没有阻碍的游行，接着便宣布了他的赫赫战果。可是就在这个时候，我军另一支部队，突然出现在平汉线上。二十六日占领了驻马店，二十七日迫近确山，威胁到唱空城计的信阳。白崇禧于慌乱之余，又令张轸率领他的三个师赶回增援确山。不料二十九日刚刚走到南阳以东约八十里的赊旗镇以南地区，就遭到我有力兵团的突然攻击。经过两天激战，伤亡一千人以上，乃于卅一日狼狈向西溃窜。我军乘胜猛追，本月一日拂晓，将敌五十八师师部及其一八三旅主力等部五千余人，截击包围于南阳以东三十余里的马刘营、连庄、韩庄地区，旋于二日夜间将其全歼。其间张轸亲率十师、二十师及驻守南阳的九师，全力数次增援，均被我军一一击溃，毙伤俘敌亦达两千以上。张轸部经我军连续截击，惶惶如丧家之狗，三日晨窜至南阳城郊。刻我军正乘胜逼进南阳。当我军围歼张轸之际，蒋匪曾严令十八军由许昌向南增援，被我有力兵团阻击于漯河地区，五天五夜，前进不过三十余里，其伤亡被俘亦在一千以上。我漯河兵团的顽强打击，对于南阳以东的胜利，起了直接有力的保证作用。发言人继称：蒋匪在中原战场所保持的机动兵力，本来就不多，而在平汉线南段的，则只有十八军和张轸的十师、二十师、五八师等三个师，经过这次战役，五八师主力已被歼灭，十师、二十师亦受创惨重，一时均难以恢复元气。这种情况，使得蒋贼本来就是被迫应付，捉襟见肘的中原军事形势，在人民解放军今后日益强大的攻势面前，将会处于更加困难的境地。
