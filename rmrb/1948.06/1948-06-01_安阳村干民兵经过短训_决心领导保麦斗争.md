　　【Taihang News】With the wheat harvest approaching, Anyang's fourth, eighth, and ninth districts began short-term training for militia and village cadres in late last month to carry out the wheat protection struggle victoriously. They were reorganized ideologically and organizationally to restore border defense and strengthen the wheat protection struggle. Currently, 450 people have been trained. At the beginning of the training, due to a general lack of understanding of the Land Law and the spirit of party rectification, coupled with the enemy exploiting our reorganization by spreading rumors and threats, the village cadres and militia were very confused and had many concerns. When they first participated in the training, many were prepared to be "rectified" and "detained," and some even prepared a lot of things, planning to be trained for a long time. In light of the ideological situation of the village cadres and militia, the training began by studying current affairs to clarify the current situation for everyone, correctly interpreting the Land Law, and emphasizing that cadres who made mistakes should be treated differently according to the severity of the case, focusing on curing the disease and saving the patient, not "treating walnuts and dates the same." The leadership also made some self-criticism of the past, proposing today's wheat protection struggle and strengthening our work. It was especially explained that mistakes made by cadres are internal matters of the peasants, and the peasant masses have the right to criticize and supervise us. We should earnestly examine and correct our mistakes and become good cadres. This dispelled the village cadres' and militia's concerns about the Land Law and party rectification. A village chief said, "It was not good to the masses in the past, and if there are mistakes, we should admit them to the masses and examine ourselves well, which is very right." This changed the state of silence and began to reveal their "inner thoughts," examining their shortcomings and mistakes. From examining those who lay down and refused to work, it was revealed that landlords were exploiting loopholes to carry out threats, bribery, and collusion with the puppet regime. This alerted everyone to the fact that "lying down and not working is very detrimental to work, and if this continues, the wheat will not be insured!" As a result, the public demanded to be organized to continue working, to protect the wheat harvest, to unite all possible strata in the border area, and to jointly oppose Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from seizing grain and conscripting soldiers. Finally, in the atmosphere of everyone demanding to be actively organized to work, new work arrangements were made. It was stipulated that armed protection of the wheat harvest and production for disaster relief are the current central tasks, and border defense should be restored immediately, the militia should be reorganized, the enemy should be economically blockaded, the masses should be strengthened in eliminating traitors, and men should transport iron and steel, and women should weed wheat, actively leading production to overcome the disaster, mobilizing to protect wheat, protect lives, and protect livestock, harvesting, fighting, and hiding quickly, and attacking grain-grabbing enemies. After the meeting, many villages demanded to increase firearms, and those without guns also demanded to be armed. Now everyone has actively moved into action.

　　安阳村干民兵经过短训
  　决心领导保麦斗争
    【太行消息】麦收即到，安阳四、八、九区为胜利进行保麦斗争，于上月下旬即着手开始了民兵村干的短期训练，从思想上、组织上进行整顿，以恢复边地联防，加强保麦斗争，现已训练了四百五十人。训练开始，因为普遍的对土地法与整党精神不了解，加上敌人钻我整编的空子，进行造谣威胁，所以村干民兵思想很混乱，有很多顾虑。在初参加训练时，许多人准备着挨整被“扣”，甚至还有的准备不少东西，打算长期受训。根据村干及民兵的这些思想情况，在进行上，首先学习时事，使大家明了目前形势。正确的解释土地法，并着重说明干部犯了错要分别是非轻重，治病救人，不是“核桃枣一律查”。领导上并对过去作了些检讨，提出今天的保麦斗争，加强我们的工作。并特别说明干部有了错是农民内部的事，农民群众有权利批评和监督我们，自己应认真检查纠正错误，变成个好干部。这样解除了村干部及民兵对土地法和整党的顾虑。有一个村长说：“过去对群众不好，有了错应当向群众承认，好好检查自己，这很对”。如此便转变了大家不吭气的状态，开始暴露自己的“心底话”，检查自己的缺点和错误。从检查躺倒不干中，并揭发了地主钻空进行威胁收买、串通维持等阴谋，这样使大家警惕到“躺倒不干，损害工作太大了，要再这样，麦子也不保险！”这一来，大众要求组织起来继续干，保卫麦收，团结边地可能团结的各阶层，共同反对蒋匪抢粮抓丁。最后在大家要求积极组织起来干的情绪下，进行了新的工作布署。规定了以武装保卫麦收、生产渡荒为当前中心工作，马上恢复联防，整顿民兵，从经济上封锁敌人，加强群众除奸工作，以及男人贩钢铁、女人锄麦，积极领导生产渡过灾荒，动员起来保麦、保命、保牲口，快收快打快藏，打击抢粮敌人。会后有许多村就要求增加枪支，没有枪的也要求发枪武装自己。现大家已积极走向了行动。
