Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 15th: Comprehensive report: The large-scale Chinese student patriotic movement "Against the US Supporting the Revival of Japanese Aggressive Forces" has now continued for more than a month. This marks a new upsurge in the people's patriotic movement. Over the past three years, the combination of American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek government's traitorous policies, striving to support the revival of Japanese aggressive forces, has created a serious threat to China. To safeguard national security and independence, patriotic students have had no choice but to speak out and launch resistance.

This movement first began in Shanghai, and then spread to Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other places. The Shanghai students' movement against US support for Japan was resolved at the "May Fourth" anniversary rally of ten thousand people. Subsequently, the "Shanghai Student Union Against US Aid to Japan Policy and Rescuing the National Crisis" was formed, and a 100,000-person signature campaign against US support for Japan was launched. Under the leadership of the Union, Shanghai students held three large-scale demonstrations and rallies on May 22nd, June 3rd, and 5th. According to foreign news agencies, each rally was attended by more than ten thousand people, with the June 3rd rally reaching thirty thousand. Students from Nanjing Central University and Jinling University held continuous anti-aggression and anti-oppression demonstrations on May 21st and 22nd. Several thousand students from Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan held a joint demonstration in Beiping on May 30th, sending telegrams to the US State Department and MacArthur, protesting against the US policy of supporting Japan's aggression against China, and sending telegrams to the International Student Union, requesting people from all countries to assist in opposing the US policy of supporting Japan. After the meeting, the "Student Union Against US Aid to Japan" was formed, including twelve universities and specialized schools from Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan. Xiamen students held a patriotic demonstration on May 28th (some say May 29th). Students in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places conducted patriotic propaganda to the public in the form of slogans, exhibitions, and living newspapers, and held on-campus lectures, discussions, and "US Policy on Japan" quizzes. In a test of 940 students at St. John's University in Shanghai, 860 answered that "the revival of Japanese fascism will cause Japan to invade China again." In a test at Peking University in Beiping, the vast majority of students believed that "China will be the first to suffer from the revival of Japan." Patriotic students denounced Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous crimes of actively supporting the US policy of supporting Japan. The mimeographed "Student Newspaper" issued by the Shanghai Student Union severely criticized the Chiang government for "cooperating with American and Japanese imperialists, attempting to stop the victory of the Chinese people." In the "Current Affairs Cartoon Exhibition" organized by students of the Shanghai Law School, a cartoon depicted the public enemy, the puppet president Chiang Kai-shek, wearing a dragon robe and kneeling before Uncle Sam, accepting the new Twenty-One Demands in a shameful manner. The broad masses of students clearly recognized the doomed fate of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship. In the demonstration by Nanjing students on May 21st (the day after Chiang Kai-shek took office as puppet president), they performed a living newspaper play depicting Yuan Shikai, the thief of the state, becoming emperor, but being overthrown by the people shortly after.

This student patriotic movement represents the will of the broad masses of the people. It occurred and developed under the direct and indirect support and solidarity of patriotic people from all walks of life. As early as April, 124 people from cultural, educational, industrial, and financial circles in Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places jointly issued "Opinions on the Japanese Issue," pointing out that "under the protection and support of the United States, the Japanese imperialists, who had just had their golden feathers killed (meaning feathers rubbed off and unable to fly - editor), have the momentum of regaining their feathers." They continued: "We must mobilize patriotic people from all walks of life across the country to quickly launch a patriotic movement to correct the US's erroneous policy towards Japan, prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascist remnants, and safeguard the Chinese nation." In early June, more than 200 professors, writers, playwrights, economists, newspaper editors, and industrialists from Shanghai, Beiping, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, as well as more than 70 people from Hong Kong's industrial, commercial, and cultural circles, successively issued statements, expressing their solemn attitude against US support for Japan. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 7th, "all newspapers in all countries" in Shanghai acknowledged that under the US plan for "Japan's economic recovery to pre-war levels," its "next step is to return to its policy of aggression."

Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous crimes and American imperialism used all kinds of despicable methods to attempt to sabotage and suppress this patriotic movement. The Central Daily News repeatedly screamed wildly that the patriotic students should be "surgically removed" and "uprooted" to "stop" the student patriotic movement. The Youth Department of the Chiang Party's Propaganda Department even openly ordered newspapers and news agencies in various places to prohibit the publication of news about the student patriotic movement. During the Shanghai student demonstration in May, the Chiang bandits dispatched thousands of police, military police, cavalry, and armored vehicles, arresting more than 50 students on the spot. In the Beiping demonstration on the 9th, 15 students were injured. Wu Guozhen, the Chiang-appointed mayor of Shanghai, even ordered the authorities of various schools on the 5th to immediately expel the demonstrating students. The Chiang Kai-shek government also ordered its professional secret agents and "students" in various places to use all kinds of shameless means to undermine the student patriotic movement. In Shanghai, a small number of secret agents formed the so-called "Bandit Suppression and National Construction Association" in various schools, and secret agent "students" wore pistols to intimidate patriots. Kuomintang secret agents at Shanghai Law School tore up the Current Affairs Cartoon Exhibition and beat and arrested several students. One student was pushed down from the third floor by a secret agent, causing serious injuries to his head and waist. In Nanjing Central University, Chiang bandit secret agent "students" sabotaged the "May 20th" massacre memorial meeting. Shocked by the powerful student patriotic movement, the American imperialists were forced to tear off their masks and personally intervene in the Chinese patriotic movement. Officials from the US Embassy and the US Consulate General in Shanghai went to St. John's University to instruct the school authorities on methods to suppress the students. Stuart, even issued a statement on the 4th, shamelessly defending the US policy of supporting Japan, slandering the Chinese student patriotic movement as a "conspiracy" and a "mistake," and threatening Chinese students with so-called "unfortunate consequences."

But all this could not stop the students' resolute patriotic actions. Stuart's extremely insulting statement to the Chinese people aroused the anger of the entire Chinese people, and also aroused the indignation of righteous people in the United States. Stuart's statement was issued on the 4th, and Shanghai students responded to him on the morning of the 5th with a ten thousand-person demonstration in front of the headquarters of the US Navy in Shanghai. The demonstrating students broke through the heavy encirclement and beatings of the military police, shouting "Down with the US policy of reviving Japanese aggression," "US troops go back to the United States," "Down with American aid (referring to aid to Chiang)," and "Long live the independence of the Chinese nation." The student unions of eleven universities in Beiping, led by Yenching University, where Stuart had served as president for many years, issued a statement on the 6th, lodging a serious protest with Stuart, denouncing his interference in China's internal affairs, and pointing out that any external interference and oppression "cannot stop this movement." In addition, 210 professors and cultural figures in Beiping, editors of ten publications in Shanghai, some professors in Shanghai, and the Hong Kong Chinese press successively issued statements refuting Stuart. Nanjing Central University, Jinling University, and Ginling Women's College also launched a signature campaign of protest. The US Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy also sent a telegram to Stuart to protest, denouncing Stuart's actions of threatening Chinese students as "exactly the same as the Japanese imperialists' attempt to suppress the patriotic movement of the Chinese people before the war," and demanding that the US State Department revoke Stuart's statement. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 6th, J.B. Powell, editor of the Shanghai-based American Millard's Review, also believed that "the Chinese have the right to fear Japan's economic revival, because this is the first step Japan took before the war."

Regardless of the persecution and intimidation of the US and Chiang, a new patriotic wave of the Chinese people is continuing to rise. After the demonstration and rally on May 30th, students in Beiping held another patriotic demonstration parade of several thousand people on June 9th. After the demonstration, students from various schools held a joint general strike for two days. Students in Fuzhou have launched a boycott of Japanese goods. More than 2,800 students from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou also signed a protest against the US policy of supporting Japan. The industrial circles in Hong Kong are also preparing a movement against the US revival of Japanese industry. The broad scale and strong strength of this movement have forced the Chiang government to no longer emphasize the so-called "surgical removal" on the surface, but to publicize the so-called "extreme sympathy if it is purely from the students' own intentions," plotting to sow discord on the one hand and secretly harm on the other. This is a symbol of Chiang Kai-shek's increasingly fragile rule and approaching collapse.

### 保卫祖国的安全与独立　蒋区爱国运动新高涨

　　保卫祖国的安全与独立
  　蒋区爱国运动新高涨
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：规模宏大的中国学生“反对美国扶植日本侵略势力复活”的爱国运动，现已持续一个月以上，这是人民爱国运动的新高涨。过去三年中美帝国主义者与蒋介石政府卖国政策结合，努力扶植日本侵略势力复活的结果，已造成了对于中国的严重威胁，为了保卫祖国的安全与独立，爱国的学生遂不能不起而大声疾呼，展开反抗。
    这次运动首先发动于上海，继即扩展到南京、北平、天津、唐山、厦门、福州、广州等地。上海学生反对美国扶日运动，系于“五四”纪念万人大会上决议发动，接着组成“上海学生反对美国援日政策挽救民族危机联合会”，并发起反对美国扶日的十万人签名运动，在联合会领导下，上海学生先后于五月二十二日、六月三日及五日举行三次大规模示威集会，据外国通讯社报导，每次集会人数皆在万人以上，其中六月三日集会则为三万人。南京中大、金陵两大学学生于五月二十一、二十二两日连续举行反侵略反压迫示威。平、津、唐学生数千人于五月三十日在北平举行联合示威，致电美国务院及麦克阿瑟，抗议美国扶日侵华政策，并致电国际学联，要求各国人民协助反对美国扶日政策，会后组成包括平、津、唐十二大学及专科学校学生的“反对美国援日学生联合会”。厦门学生于五月二十八日（一说为二十九日）举行爱国示威。沪、平等地学生皆以标语、展览会、活报剧形式向市民进行爱国宣传，并举行校内演讲会、讨论会以及“美国对日政策”问题测验。上海圣约翰大学九百四十人的测验中，八百六十人的答案认为“日本法西斯复活，将引起日本再度侵华。”北平北大测验中，绝大多数学生认为“中国将首先遭受日本复活之害”，爱国学生痛斥蒋介石积极支持美国扶日政策的卖国罪行。上海学生联合会发行的油印“学生报”，严斥蒋政府“与美日帝国主义合作，妄图阻止中国人民的胜利”。上海法学院学生主办的“时事漫画展览会”中，有一幅漫画描绘人民公敌伪总统蒋介石身披龙袍，跪在山姆大叔面前，接受新二十一条卖国条约的丑态，蒋介石卖国独裁的毁灭命运，已为广大学生认识得清清楚楚。南京学生五月二十一日（即蒋介石就任伪总统的第二天）示威中，曾公演窃国大盗袁世凯做皇帝，但不久即被人民推翻的活报剧。
    这次学生爱国运动是代表着广大人民意志，它是在各界爱国人士直接间接支持和声援下发生和发展起来的，早在四月京、沪、平、津等地，文化、教育、实业、金融各界一百二十四人即曾联名发表“对日问题主张”，指出“在美国保护与扶植下，刚才金杀羽（意即羽毛擦落不能飞翔——编者）的日本帝国主义有羽毛重丰之势。”继称：“必须集中全国各界爱国人士迅速展开一个纠正美国对日错误政策，制止日本法西斯残余抬头，保卫中华民族的爱国运动”。六月初上海、北平、南京、广州与厦门的教授、作家、剧人、经济学家、报纸编辑与工业家二百余人及香港工商文化界七十余人又相继发表声明，表明反对美国扶植日本之严正态度。另据合众社上海七日电称，上海“各国一切报纸”都承认日本在美国“日本经济恢复到战前的水平”的计划下，其“下一步骤就是恢复到侵略政策”。
    蒋介石卖国罪行和美国帝国主义用尽各种卑劣办法，企图破坏和压迫此一爱国运动。中央日报一再狂呼对爱国学生要“操刀一割”，“斩草除根”以“制止”学生爱国运动，蒋党中宣部青年部更公开下令禁止各地报纸通讯社发表学生爱国运动消息。五月上海学生示威中，蒋匪出动数千警宪骑兵及装甲车，当场捕去学生五十余名。北平九日示威中，学生十五人被殴伤。上海蒋记市长吴国桢且曾于五日下令各校当局立即开除示威学生，蒋介石政府并命令其在各地的职业特务“学生”，用尽各种无耻手段破坏学生爱国运动。在上海各校以少数的特务分子成立了所谓“剿匪建国会”，特务“学生”均佩带手枪威吓爱国者。上海法学院的国民党特务，曾撕毁时事漫画展览会，并殴伤及逮捕学生多人，一个学生且被特务从三楼推下，致头部腰部均受重伤。在南京中大蒋匪特务“学生”，曾破坏“五二零”惨案纪念大会。为强大的学生爱国运动所震惊的美帝国主义者，迫得撕破假面具，亲自出马干涉中国爱国运动，美大使馆和美上海总领事馆官员亲到圣约翰大学，向该校当局指示镇压学生办法。司徒雷登更于四日发表声明，为美国扶日政策作无耻辩护，诬蔑中国学生爱国运动为“阴谋”为“错误”，并以所谓“不幸后果”威胁中国学生。
    但是这一切都丝毫不能阻止学生坚决爱国行动，司徒极端侮辱中国人民的声明，更激起了全中国人民的愤怒，同时也引起美国国内正义人士的义愤；司徒声明四日发表，上海学生五日清晨即以在上海美海军总部门前的万人大示威来回答他，示威学生突破军警重重包围殴捕中高呼“打倒美国复活日本侵略的政策”“美军回美国去”、“打倒美国的援助（指援蒋）”，“中华民族独立万岁”。平津十一个大学学生自治会以司徒曾任校长多年的燕京大学领衔，于六日发表声明，向司徒提出严重抗议，斥其干涉中国内政，指出任何外力干涉和压迫都“决不能停止此一运动”。此外北平二百一十名教授及文化界名流、上海十家刊物编辑、上海一部分教授和香港华侨报界等的相继发表声明，驳斥司徒。南京中大、金陵金陵女大亦发起抗议签名运动，美民主远东政策委员会亦致电司徒提出抗议，斥司徒威胁中国学生的行动，“与战前日本帝国主义企图钳制中国人民的爱国运动是一模一样的。”要求美国务院撤销司徒声明。据美联社上海六日电，上海美国密勒士评论报编辑鲍威尔亦认为“中国人有权害怕日本的经济复兴，因为这是日本在战争之前的第一步行动”。
    不顾美蒋的迫害恫吓，中国人民新的爱国浪潮，正继续高涨。北平学生继五月三十日示威集会后，又于六月九日举行数千人爱国示威游行，各校学生在示威后，并举行联合总罢课两天。福州学生已发动抵制日货。广州中山大学学生二千八百余人亦签名抗议美国扶日政策，香港工业界也在筹备反对美国复兴日本工业运动；这一运动的广大规模与雄厚力量已迫使蒋政府在外表上对爱国运动不敢再强调所谓“操刀一割”，而宣传所谓“若纯系出诸学生本意极表同情”云云，阴谋一面挑拨离间，一面施行暗害，这正是蒋介石统治更加脆弱和接近崩溃的象征。
