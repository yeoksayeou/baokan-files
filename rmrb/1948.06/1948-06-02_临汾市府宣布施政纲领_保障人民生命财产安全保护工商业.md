[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 29th] Following its establishment on May 18th, the Linfen Democratic Municipal Government immediately issued a public notice announcing its policy program, the gist of which is as follows: (1) Abolish the bandit-puppet Baojia system of village organization, dismantle all reactionary secret service organizations of the bandit-puppets, abolish all exorbitant taxes and levies and unreasonable apportionments, establish a people's democratic government, and protect the safety of the lives and property of urban residents, workers, students, foreigners, and religious organizations. (2) Protect the freedom of operation of industry and commerce, and help them develop. The finished products and inventories of private industry and commerce will no longer be taxed. After verification by the municipal government's industrial and commercial departments, they can be freely sold. (3) Murderers who have committed heinous crimes will be arrested and dealt with separately. General bandit-puppet personnel, Kuomintang members, and Sanminzhuyi Youth League members should register with the democratic government and declare that they will no longer do bad things, and they will not be arrested. Those who have not harmed the people and are willing to serve the people will be retained by the government as appropriate. (4) Landlords and other targets of struggle who have fled to the city should quickly register with the municipal government and prepare to return to their original places. As long as they bow their heads to the people and hand over land and property, they can be allocated the same share of land and property as the peasants in accordance with the Outline Land Law of China. (5) All schools shall continue to operate, abolish anti-communist and anti-people education, and promote new democratic and people-serving education. Teachers and staff should focus on teaching, and students should focus on learning. Poor teachers and staff and out-of-school students should also be given relief. (6) It is hoped that all public and private shops and factories will resume work and business immediately. Poor citizens, unemployed workers, and technicians should be given relief and employment opportunities introduced. Workers and technicians in employment should grasp the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital and improve their living standards.

    【本报太岳二十九日电】临汾民主市政府在五月十八日成立后，当下就出布告宣布施政纲领，大意是：（一）废除匪伪保甲编村制度，解除匪伪一切反动特务组织，取消一切苛捐杂税与无理摊派，建立人民民主政权，保护城市居民、工人、学生、外侨和各宗教团体财产生命安全。（二）保护工商业自由经营，帮助他们发展。私人工商业的成品和存货，一律不再上税，由本府工商部门点验后，自由出卖。（三）对罪大恶极的杀人犯，要捕起来分别处理，一般匪伪人员、国民党员、三青团员，应向民主政府登记，宣布不再作坏事，都不逮捕。没有害过人民、愿意为人民服务的，政府还酌量留用。（四）凡逃避到城内的一般地主等斗争对象，应赶快向市政府登记，准备返回原地。只要向人民低头，交出土地财产，就可按中国土地法大纲，分给与农民同样一份土地财产。（五）所有学校一律继续开课，废除反共反人民的教育，推行新民主主义、为人民服务的教育。教职员要安心教学，学生要安心学习，对贫苦教职员和失学学生还要救济。（六）希望公私商店、工厂都马上复工营业，贫苦市民、失业工人，技术人员，都要救济，还介绍职业。在业工人与技术人员要掌握劳资两利的原则，改善生活待遇。
