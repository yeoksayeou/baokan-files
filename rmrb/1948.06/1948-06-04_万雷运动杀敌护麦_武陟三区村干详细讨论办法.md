　　Launching a "Ten Thousand Thunder" Movement to Kill Enemies and Protect Wheat
　　Detailed Discussion of Methods by Village Cadres in the Third District of Wuzhi
　　[Wuzhi News] The Third District of Wuzhi held a meeting of 55 key village cadres from the entire district for two days, the 23rd and 24th, to enthusiastically discuss the struggle to protect wheat, guerrilla warfare, and political offensives.
　　Initially, the village cadres were in low spirits. The village head of Macun said: "We can't harvest the wheat at home, and now we're having a meeting. I don't think administrative orders will ever fix it. Who doesn't know how to harvest wheat?" The leadership reviewed its past neglect of veteran cadres and emphasized that "cadres have made many contributions in the past. Even if they have shortcomings, as long as they lead the masses well and protect their interests in the struggle to protect wheat, the masses will support us again." After deliberation, it was unanimously agreed that lying down and doing nothing would only fool oneself and harm the masses; to survive, one must struggle.
　　After the mood improved, discussions were divided by joint defense groups on how to defend the wheat harvest and how to conduct guerrilla warfare. After an afternoon and evening of discussion, the following measures were decided: 1. Organize militia joint defenses, constantly operate in the front, and cover the masses harvesting wheat. 2. Launch a "Ten Thousand Thunder" movement, with everyone learning how to plant landmines. Those who have received landmine training in each village should use various opportunities to teach everyone. 3. Combine small mutual aid groups on a voluntary basis, using work points and equivalent exchange. Because the wheat ripening period north and south of the Yunliang River is four or five days apart, Henan and Hebei should support each other and help each other to rush the harvest, shortening the wheat harvesting time. 4. Help military dependents and militia dependents who lack labor with harvesting. 5. Tighten sentry posts, strengthen intelligence and counter-espionage work, and inspect passing pedestrians. 6. Improve the village headquarters, clearly divide labor, and coordinate between the front and rear. 7. Grain storage issue: It was proposed to "harvest a little, fight a little, and store a little." 8. At night, the militia will operate in the front, and the self-defense forces will be appropriately concentrated to cover the night harvest. After the discussion on the struggle to protect wheat, it was proposed to launch a political offensive during the wheat harvest to strive for more people to return home.
　　Finally, the leadership made specific arrangements and called on cadres to be models, make meritorious contributions, and be good hired laborers in the wheat harvest struggle.

　　万雷运动杀敌护麦
  　武陟三区村干详细讨论办法
    【武陟消息】武陟三区在二十三和二十四两天内，召开了全区五十五人的主要村干部会议，热烈讨论了保麦斗争，游击战争和政攻等问题。
    开始村干情绪很低。马村村长说：“家摆麦不能收，又开会哩，我看不行政命令永弄不好，谁还不知道收麦？”领导上检讨了过去对老干部不理的态度，并着重提出“干部过去功劳不少，虽然也有毛病，只要在保麦斗争中好好领导群众，保护群众利益，群众就会重新拥护我们。”经酝酿后，一致认为：躺倒不干，是哄自己害群众，要想活命就得斗争。
    情绪转过后，就分联防讨论，怎样保卫麦收？如何开展游击战争？经一后晌一晚上讨论，决定办法是：一、组织民兵联防，经常在前边活动，掩护群众收麦。二、开展万雷运动，人人学会埋地雷，各村受地雷训的人回去，要利用各种机会教会大家。三、在自愿原则下结合小型互助组，用记工、等价交换。运粮河南北因麦子成熟期前后隔四五天，河南、河北互相支援互相帮助抢收，缩短麦收时间。四、帮助无劳力的军属跟民兵家属收割。五、严密岗哨，加强情报和锄奸工作，检查来往行人。六、健全村指挥部，具体分工，前后方互相配合。七、藏粮问题：提出要“收一点、打一点、藏一点”。八、夜间民兵到前边活动，自卫队适当集中，来掩护黑夜抢收。保麦斗争讨论后，又提出：趁麦收期间开展政治攻势，争取更多的人回家来。
    最后领导上具体作了布置，并号召干部在麦收斗争中当模范立功劳，当个好长工。
