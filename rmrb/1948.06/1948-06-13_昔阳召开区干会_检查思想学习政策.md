Xiyang Convenes District Cadre Meeting
　　Examining Ideological Study and Policies

　　[Xiyang News] Xiyang convened a production cadre meeting for each district in the county on the 24th of last month. The various groups engaged in free-ranging discussions, revealing the following ideological situations:

　　I. Policy study is too poor, the mind is unclear, and superiors issue an order, and we just do it, even to the point of rigidly applying the experiences of a certain place reported in the newspaper, thinking that if we make a mistake, we have something to lean on. Some say that we should study Marxism-Leninism and grasp Bolshevik principles, but they don't know how to study. Hao Bao and others said, "Every time we reflect thoroughly, we recognize our mistakes, but we make them again when we go down" (actually, they can't grasp the principles).

　　II. Left-leaning thought still exists. We don't consider what poor peasants and hired laborers say, and we believe them completely. We are always suspicious of what middle peasants say, and we are unwilling to talk to them, fearing that we will follow the middle peasant line.

　　III. Illiterate people are discouraged and depressed. They feel they are useless and might as well go home early.

　　IV. Individualism is at play. People are afraid of making mistakes and dare not face reality. Yu Chenghai said, "I used to reflect a lot of material, and a lot of it was published (referring to tabloids); now, when I pick up a pen, I am afraid of being seen as trying to get ahead and gain personal fame. Therefore, I have only written one article in three months."

　　From this meeting, the leadership understood that they had previously only paid attention to the ideological problems of village cadres and not to the ideological problems of district cadres, assuming that after learning, there would be no more problems. As a result, today we see that cadres returning from study at the prefectural committee (the good aspects will not be mentioned) are generally timid and dare not work boldly.

　　After the meeting enlightened the cadres' thinking, they studied Comrade Zhang Dingcheng's policy on cadres (reported on May 20th). Everyone discussed it for a day and a half and a whole night, understanding that the Party's policy on cadres is to unite, cherish, educate, and transform them, and to adopt an attitude of curing the sickness to save the patient. At the same time, they powerfully criticized all forms of individualism that do not consider the interests of the masses, and which are expressed in various forms, as violations of the Party's principles and the people's interests, and must be eradicated in the future. They boldly and wholeheartedly resolved to work as long-term laborers for the masses. Therefore, everyone resolved to work hard to study and master the policies. The main focus was on Chairman Mao's speech at the Jin-Sui Cadre Meeting, Ren Bishi's report, Chen Boda's On the Policy of Industry and Commerce, the Central Committee's draft on class demarcation, the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taihang District Party Committee on correcting "leftism," and various instructions from the leadership. Finally, the leadership made a profound examination of the mistakes made since the rectification campaign, truly distinguishing between right and wrong, and sharing responsibility where it was due. After the meeting, the cadres said, "What are we still afraid of?" They also reviewed and examined their attitude towards village cadres.

　　昔阳召开区干会
  　检查思想学习政策
    【昔阳消息】昔阳在上月二十四县召开了各区生产干部会议。各个小组自由漫谈酝酿，谈出以下这些思想情况：
    一、对政策学习太差，头脑不清，上级布置一条办一条，甚至是死套报上某地方的经验，认为作错了有靠墙。有的说叫学习马列主义掌握布尔什维克原则，但不知怎样学习，郝保等说：“每次反省的彻底，也认识了自己错误，但是下去就又犯啦”（实际是摸不着原则）。
    二、仍存在着左倾思想，贫雇说的话不加考虑，十分相信。中农的话总是怀疑，不愿和他谈话，怕走了中农路线。
    三、不识字的自馁苦闷。感到没出息，不如趁早回家。
    四、个人主义作怪，怕犯错，不敢正视现实，于成海说：“我过去反映材料很多登的也不少（指小报）；现在拿起笔来，怕说抢先落好，个人名誉，因此三个月来只写了一篇。”
    从这个会议，领导上才了解了以前光注意村干部思想问题，不注意区干思想问题，以为经过学习了没有什么了，结果今天看，从地委学习回来的干部（好的一面不谈了）普遍小手小足，不敢大胆工作。
    会议经过启发干部思想后，学习了张鼎丞同志对干部的政策（五月二十号报载）大家讨论了一天半一黑夜，摸透了党对干部的政策是团结、爱护、教育、改造，治病救人的态度。同时有力的批判了一切不从群众利益着想，以各种形式表现出来的个人主义，都是违背党的原则人民利益的，今后必须根除。大胆的全心全意的决心为群众当长工。于是大家都决心努力学习掌握政策。主要的是毛主席在晋绥干部会上的讲话、任弼时报告、陈伯达论工商业政策、中央划阶级草案、中央局对太行区党委纠左指示，以及领导上的各种指示。最后领导上把整党以来所犯的错误作了深刻检查，并真正分清是非，该分担的就分担责任，会后干部说：“这样了还怕啥？”并把自己对村干的态度也作了回顾与检查。
