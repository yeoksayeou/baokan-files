    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th] TASS, Sofia: Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria's new industrial center, is under construction. The city is located on the banks of the Maritsa River, a few kilometers from Haskovo in southern Bulgaria. The left bank of the Maritsa River contains approximately 120 million to 150 million tons of coal reserves, and the right bank has abundant limestone and clay. These natural resources are conducive to the accelerated development of the new industrial city. "Maritsa Power Station No. 1" has already been built there, and "Maritsa Power Station No. 1," with a generating capacity of 50,000 kilowatts, will also be built. Workers' residential areas, clubs, canteens, bakeries, kindergartens, and theaters are being built in the new city. The new city will initially accommodate 15,000 workers. The voluntary labor of youth volunteer teams has saved 200 million leva (Bulgarian currency) for the construction of the new city.
