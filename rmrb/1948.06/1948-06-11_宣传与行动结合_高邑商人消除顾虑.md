　　Combining Propaganda and Action
　　Gaoyi Merchants Eliminate Concerns
　　[Gaoyi News] Since the mass movement two years ago, most of the large and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses in Gaoyi have collapsed. According to investigations, the reasons are: (1) Thirteen households were confiscated by the government because they had shares held by traitors. (2) Eighteen households were struggled against during the mass movement. (3) Fourteen households fled out of fear due to the above two situations. (4) Eleven households (mostly foreign cloth shops) felt that business wasn't developing, and fearing struggle, took advantage of the war preparedness (after the autumn of the year before last) to move back home. The seventeen large and medium-sized businesses that did not suffer losses were also very uneasy, always adopting a perfunctory attitude; specifically, they displayed goods in the front, but the shelves were mostly empty. Not to mention development, they sometimes even lost money. They simply had the mindset of "living one day at a time, not knowing when disaster will strike."
　　
　　In the previous period, a meeting was held with some older, experienced merchants to study the reasons for the lack of development and boldness in the past. These included: (1) Fear of struggle. (2) Past participation in struggle sessions, corvée labor, and land tilling caused loss of working hours and lack of benefits. (3) Lack of status; militiamen borrowed things casually, and their attitude was very harsh upon entering the door, not caring if borrowed items were damaged (especially borrowing merchants' carts and riding them until they were broken), but one did not dare refuse to lend them. (4) It was inconvenient to go out to do business and sell goods; it took four procedures to obtain a travel permit to leave the county (group leader, household registration office, public security officer, town government, etc.). (5) Profits were not much, but donations were plentiful (such as joining the army, supporting the front, watching operas at temples, and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs during the New Year). Due to the above reasons, it really affected merchants' willingness to do business, let alone develop it.
　　
　　Since the promulgation of the Land Law, meetings of merchants have been held to publicize and explain the policy of "protecting industry and commerce, developing industry and commerce." This was not very effective in the previous period, and the merchants still did not increase the goods on their shelves, maintaining a wait-and-see attitude, "trimming their sails to the wind."
　　
　　In the past half-month, the policy on industry and commerce has been thoroughly publicized, combined with practical actions to return property to industrialists and merchants. The work of returning sealed assets has now achieved the following: (1) Two households have had their seals removed: First, Yuji Grocery Store has already started business after the seal was removed. Second, Zhixingcheng Grocery Store has also had its seal removed. (2) Two households have had their property returned: First, Fusheng Liu Color Shop on the west side of West Street. Second, Deyuanlong Color Shop inside the South Gate of the Main Street. Due to the influence of these practical actions, industry and commerce have greatly developed in recent days. For example, Fuyuanheng on the west side of the Main Street, which previously had no goods on the shelves, has filled its counters in the past six or seven days (pastry shop); runaway merchants Wang Xiaochou, Liu Zongwen, and others have moved their families back and reopened their shops for business. Now, efforts are continuing to correct deviations, and various merchants are beginning to develop and rise vigorously. (Gaoyi County Office, Li Zhaohai, Liang Jiping)

　　宣传与行动结合
  　高邑商人消除顾虑
    【高邑消息】高邑工商业自前年群运以来，大部分大中工商业垮了台。据考查原因：（一）因有汉奸股，政府没收过的有十三户。（二）群运时斗争过的十八户。（三）因为以上两项情况影响害怕逃亡的十四户。（四）觉到商业没发展，又害怕斗争趁备战时（前年秋后）顺水推舟搬回家的十一户（多是洋布行）。未受损失的大中商十七户，情绪也十分不安，老是采取支应门面的态度；具体表现是门里摆着货，架子但都是空的，不用说发展，有时还赔钱呢？简直是“过了一天说一天，不知哪天有灾难”的思想。
    前一时期召开一部分老一些有经验的商人座谈，研究过去不发展不大胆原因，计有：（一）害怕斗争。（二）过去因参加斗争会、支差、代耕等，误工不得利。（三）没地位，关里民兵随便借东西，一进门态度就很硬，借用坏了不管（特别是借商人车子骑坏了不管），但又不敢不借给。（四）出外经商贩货不自便，经过四道手续，才开到出县的通行证（组长、户籍室、公安员、镇公所等）。（五）盈利不多乐捐款倒不少（如参军、拥护前方、过庙唱戏、过年拥军优抗等）。由于以上几种原因，确实影响商人无心思经营，更谈不到发展了。
    自土地法公布以后，又结合开商人会，宣传解释：“保护工商业，发展工商业”政策。在前一时期效力不大，货架子上还是不增加货物，他们存在观望态度，“看风驶舵”。
    最近半月内深入宣传了工商业政策，又结合实际行动退还工商业。退还启封工作现已作到：（一）启封两户：一、裕记杂货铺已经在启封后开始营业。二、致兴成杂货铺也启封了。（二）退还了两户：一、西大街路西的复盛刘颜色铺。二、大街南门里德源隆颜色铺。由于这些实际行动的影响，近几天工商业大有发展，如大街路西的福元恒，过去都是架子上没货，近六七天内已摆满柜台（点心铺）；逃亡商户王小丑、刘宗文等已全家搬回，打开铺门又经营了。现在正在继续纠偏，各商户开始蓬勃发展上升。（高邑县办公室李兆海、梁际平）
