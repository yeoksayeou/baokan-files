　　[Ji Lu Yu News] The people of Lou Village, Changyuan Third District, have witnessed a stable social order and a greatly improved enthusiasm for production, thanks to our publicity of the Party's policies and practical actions to support the masses in production, disaster relief, and reduction of burdens. This village is a newly liberated area since November of last year (lunar calendar). Due to the enemy's long-term deceptive propaganda, the masses did not understand us. After we opened Changyuan, ten households of landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants fled. People from all classes were suspicious of us, silently walking home as soon as they saw us. After we investigated and studied the psychology of the masses and understood the basic reasons for this phenomenon, we seized the opportunity to publicize the Outline Land Law, explaining in detail our policies and attitudes towards all classes.
    The village suffered greatly from the enemy's long-term looting, and last year's crops were not harvested well, making the people's lives very difficult. In February and March of this year, our democratic government collected twenty shih of surplus wheat from landlords and distributed it to poor people. The government also provided 211,000 yuan in relief loans and 800,000 catties of relief grain. We also called on and organized the masses to engage in production in various ways. Production such as spinning, weaving, transportation, and salt production has greatly increased, thus maintaining the people's livelihood. For example, loans were given to ten spinning and weaving households, who wove 402 feet of cloth in twenty days, earning 122,200 yuan. Wang Fengshi and her daughter had a difficult life. After they ate the grain they were allocated, the government loaned her 10,000 yuan for spinning and weaving. In twenty days, she wove fifty-five feet of cloth, earning 14,000 yuan. Her life improved from eating half a sheng of miscellaneous grains a day to one and a half sheng. Wang Jianwu's wife has earned one shi and two dou of grain from the beginning of the year to now by spinning, so her family has not gone hungry. Wang Xianwu earned 61,000 yuan in twenty days by transporting grain, selling salt, and selling chickens. Men and women throughout the village are busy with production, rising early and sleeping late, overcoming the famine, and no one is starving. At the same time, we also led the election of the village chief, Jin Shaoting, and educated him to plan for the masses and not to waste anything. When the accounts were settled after two months, only four boxes of matches, eight packs of small cigarettes, and two liang of kerosene were used, greatly reducing the burden on the masses. The masses discussed one after another, saying: "This is not even as much as the money spent by the KMT soldiers on a casual drink." After this period of work, twenty of the households who had fled the village in the past returned. After the landlord Wang Dengke returned, he regretted saying: If I had known this, I would not have run away and lost all my belongings. Now the social order has been stabilized, and the masses have a very high belief in our democratic government.

　　长垣新区铁序稳定
  　群众安心进行生产
    【冀鲁豫讯】长垣三区楼村群众，在我宣传党的政策和扶植群众生产救灾减轻负担的实际行动下，社会秩序趋于安定，群众生产情绪大为提高。该村为去年十一月间（古历）刚解放的新区。由于敌人长期的欺骗宣传，群众对我不了解，在打开长垣后，地富和中农便逃跑了十家。各阶层群众都对我们怀疑，一望见我们就默默的走回家去。在我们调查研究了群众心理了解造成这种现象的基本原因后，便抓紧宣传土地法大纲，详细说明对各阶层的政策态度。
    该村经过敌人长期抢掠，去年庄稼又没收好，群众生活很苦。我民主政府在今年二、三月间，征收地主多余的麦子二十石分配给穷苦群众，政府又贷救济款二十一万一千元，救济粮八十万斤。又从多方面号召和组织群众进行生产。如纺织、运输、熬盐等生产大大提高，因此群众生活得到维持。如贷款给十家纺织户，她们在二十天内织出四百零二十尺布，赚钱十二万两千二百元。王冯氏和她一个女孩，生活困难，分的粮吃完后，政府又贷给她纺织款一万元，二十天中织布五十五尺，赚钱一万四千元。生活由每天吃半升杂粮改善到吃一升半了。王坚武的老婆，从年前到现在，赚了一石二斗粮食，一家人一直就没有断了＠。王现武运粮、卖盐、卖鸡子，二十天赚了六万一千元。全村男女人人忙着生产，早起晚睡，战胜了灾荒，没一家挨饿的。同时我们又领导着选举了村长靳绍亭，教育他为群众打算，不要浪费。到两个月结帐时，只用了四盒洋火，八包小烟，二两洋油，大大的减轻了群众负担。群众纷纷议论说：“这还没有蒋军在时随便往哪里喝一场酒花的钱多”。经过这一段工作之后，过去村里逃跑的户回来二十人。地主王登科回来后，后悔的说：早知道这样，怎么也不跑出去，把东西都跑光了。现在社会秩序已经安定，群众对我民主政府信仰很高。
