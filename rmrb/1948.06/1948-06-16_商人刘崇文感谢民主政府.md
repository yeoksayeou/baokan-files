　　Merchant Liu Chongwen Thanks the Democratic Government
    Editor:
    My name is Liu Chongwen. I have been running the "Fuxing Liu" paint shop in Gaoyi for over thirty years. The year before last, in the twelfth month of the lunar year, I was narrow-minded and didn't understand the government's policies. In a moment of foolishness, I went to Shimen and worked with someone in a small sundry shop. After a few months, something went wrong (a fire), and I lost money. I thought, "This is the end, I deserve this." Unexpectedly, a few days ago, a fellow merchant sent me a letter saying that the government had asked me to come back and take over my old business. It turned out that after I left, the government took care of my paint shop on my behalf, returning it to me intact without any loss. After I came back, Director Han and Section Chief Ma, along with comrades from the liquidation committee, returned all my furniture and paints to me. The government also gave me all 340,000 yuan from the sale of the paints they had sold on my behalf. I have now excitedly taken it over and reopened my doors. I am very happy. In addition to doing business, I also do some odd jobs every day. In addition to thanking the government, I also plan to further develop my business. I am completely at ease and understand that the government's policy is to protect and develop industry and commerce. I must expand my operations. Please, comrades of the newspaper, be sure to publish this to express my feelings.
  　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely, Liu Chongwen of "Fuxing Liu" in Gaoyi

　　商人刘崇文感谢民主政府
    编辑同志：
    我叫刘崇文，在高邑开“复盛刘”颜色铺已有三十多年，前年腊月我心眼小，不明白政府政策，一时想不开，就上了石门，到石门和人家伙干一小杂货铺，干了几个月，出了错（失火），赔了钱，我心里想：“这算完了活该受罪。”想不到前些日子，我同行商人给我去了一信说，政府叫我回来接收我的旧商业。原来是自我走后政府代为保管我的颜色铺一丝未受损失的原封退还给我。我回来后，就有韩局长和马科长协同清委会同志们把我的家具及颜色全退还我，政府给代卖的三十四万元的颜色价也全给了我。我现已经很兴奋的接收了，重新又大开了门，我心里非常高兴，我每天除经商还干些杂活，我除感谢政府以外，还打算再发展我的营业。我完全放心和明白了政府政策是保护工商业、发展工商业的，我一定要扩大经营。请报社同志千万给我登上表表我的心情。
  　　　　　　　　　　　高邑“复盛刘号”刘崇文启
