Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 1st. The workers of a certain public factory in Jin-Sui, in reviewing the past work of the trade union, unanimously agreed that the past work of the trade union was successful, such as ensuring the completion of the production plan, and sometimes even exceeding the plan. It also achieved excellence in production competitions, and made progress in leading workers in learning and paying attention to hygiene. However, the review of the work of the trade union also revealed that some trade union cadres and members have not yet understood what the tasks of the trade union in a revolutionary factory should be, and one-sidedly emphasize workers' "welfare" and confrontation with the administration. This fundamental misconception of confronting the factory is the main reason why the trade union cannot develop in a healthy manner. In this review, Wen Xianbi, the former union committee member, said: "In the past, I thought that the union's job was to seek benefits for the workers, such as demanding to improve workers' living standards, demanding to be demobilized and marry a wife as soon as possible, etc. Sometimes the factory's production tasks were very tight, and I would also demand to watch a play, otherwise I would think it would affect the workers' mood, and I would use words like 'I am not responsible for the loss of work' to make things difficult for the factory, and I rarely cared about the factory's difficulties and production tasks." Worker Liu Lisuan reviewed and said: "In the past, when electing union committee members, I specifically elected those who could 'bump into' the 'organization' (the factory), which made our own organization (the union) impure." Everyone recalled that in 1940 and 1941, it was the most difficult period in Jin-Sui. The military and civilians were very difficult, and everyone ate black beans. The lives of the workers were not bad, but they asked the public to improve their lives. Everyone confirmed that in a revolutionary factory, the task of the trade union of a public factory should be to guide workers to cooperate with the factory management to first ensure the completion of revolutionary production tasks, improve the quantity and quality of products, reduce costs, love the factory, save materials, and support the front lines. At the same time, under reasonable and possible conditions, try to solve the difficulties in the lives of workers, develop workers' welfare undertakings, and insure the lives of workers to achieve the consolidation of internal democracy and unity in the factory. Of course, it would be wrong if the trade union ignored the protection of workers' lives and the solution of workers' life problems. The trade union would then be separated from the workers. However, it is even more wrong to emphasize the lives of workers to an excessively high and inappropriate degree, thereby hindering the operation and development of the factory. After this review and deliberation, the workers had a new and correct understanding of the trade union issue in the public factory. More than 90% of the workers in the factory automatically signed up to join the trade union, and a new committee was formed through elections.

### 晋绥某公营工厂　检查工作重建组织

　　晋绥某公营工厂
  　检查工作重建组织
    【新华社晋绥一日电】晋绥某公营工厂工人，检查过去职工会工作中，一致认为过去职工会工作是有成绩的，如保证了生产计划的完成，有时并超过计划。在生产竞赛中争取了优胜，又在领导工人进行学习、讲求卫生等方面，亦有进步。但检查职工会工作的结果，同时发现了一部分工会干部和会员对于革命工厂的职工会任务应该是什么，也还没有弄清楚，而一味片面强调工人“福利”与行政上闹对立，这个与工厂闹对立的基本错误观念是职工会不能健全发展的主要原因。这次检查中，过去的工会委员温羡壁说：“我过去认为工会给工人谋利益就是要求提高工人生活待遇，要求早日复员娶老婆等等，有时工厂生产任务很紧，还提出要求看戏，不然就认为影响工人情绪，就拿工作受损失我不负责这类话来为难工厂，而对于工厂的困难及生产任务则很少关心。”工人刘立拴检讨说：“过去选举工会委员时，我专门选举那些能和‘组织上’（工厂）碰几下的人，这样把自己的组织（工会）就闹得不纯洁。”大家回忆当一九四○年和四一年时，那是晋绥最艰苦的时期，军民均十分困难，各地都吃黑豆，工人生活已不算坏，但反而向公家要求改善生活。大家确认在革命工厂中，认为公营工厂的职工会的任务应该是引导工人与工厂管理机关合作，首先保证完成革命生产任务，提高产品的数量和质量，减低成本，爱护工厂，节省材料，支援前线。同时在合理与可能的条件下，尽量解决工人生活上的困难，发展工人福利事业，保险工人的生活以达到巩固工厂内部的民主团结，自然，工会如果忽视对于工人生活的保障及工人生活困难问题的解决，那是不对的，那工会就要脱离工人。但把工人生活强调到过高的不适当的地步，因而妨害工厂的经营与发展，那就更加不对了。经过这一检讨与酝酿后，工人对公营工厂里的职工会问题，在思想上有了新的与正确的认识。该厂百分之九十以上工人自动签名加入工会，并经选举组成了新的委员会。
