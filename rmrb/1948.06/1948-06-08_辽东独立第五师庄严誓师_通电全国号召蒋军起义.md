　　Liaodong Independent 5th Division Solemnly Swears an Oath
　　Sends Telegram to the Entire Country Calling on Chiang’s Troops to Revolt
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, May 5th: The former Chiang's army Temporary 58th Division, which revolted in Yingkou in late February, has now been reorganized into the Northeast People's Liberation Army Liaodong Independent 5th Division. On the 16th of last month, the division solemnly held a swearing-in ceremony in a certain location. Division Commander Wang Jiasan, Deputy Division Commander Tang Shilin, and Chief of Staff Zhang (surname only) signed a telegram on behalf of all officers and soldiers to the entire country, praising the development of productive forces, economic prosperity, and the greatly increased enthusiasm of the people in the Liberated Areas for joining the army and participating in the war after the implementation of land reform, as well as the invincible power of the People's Liberation Army implementing military democracy. They called on Chiang's troops to recognize the situation and quickly revolt and join the People's Liberation Army. The telegram strongly stated: "Our glorious revolt has pointed out a bright path for many Chiang's troops to turn to the revolution in the future. We firmly believe that among Chiang's troops, there are many young people with aspirations who, like us, are willing to pursue the truth and move towards the light. We earnestly hope that everyone will no longer have any illusions about Chiang and the United States, and even less make unnecessary sacrifices for Chiang’s little dynasty. The general trend and the will of the people show that the nationwide victory of the revolution is not far off. We urge everyone to make a decision as soon as possible and not to hesitate and wait and see, otherwise they will miss a good opportunity and regret it too late."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, May 4th: The Harbin PLA Officer Training Regiment held a grand gathering on May 20th to celebrate the first anniversary of the regiment's establishment. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, attended and delivered speeches. Vice Chairman Gao encouraged the regiment's trainees that, after jumping out of the pit of the old society and entering the new society, they should be determined to start from scratch and become new people. Deputy Director Zhou Huan emphasized that Chiang's army's defeat was a foregone conclusion, and no one could save it. Under this new situation, liberated army officers should intensify their studies and change their positions in order to contribute to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause in the future. Wang Xihu, the trainee representative of the regiment, gave a reply, expressing his deep gratitude for the generous treatment of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. He was determined to stand on the side of the people, make contributions to the people, and redeem himself. On the same day, the regiment held a grand dinner party and a grand entertainment evening. Various teams also held various ball games, which was an unprecedented occasion. It is reported that the Northeast Military Region has a total of nine PLA Officer Training Regiments. From the spring of 1947 to the end of March this year, the regiments have successively accommodated more than 13,000 captured Chiang's army officers, of which one-tenth voluntarily participated in the work of the People's Liberation Army, and the rest have been released.
