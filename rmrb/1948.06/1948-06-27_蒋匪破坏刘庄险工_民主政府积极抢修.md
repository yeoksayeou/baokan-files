[Jilu Yu Telegram, 25th] The democratic government is actively repairing the Liu Zhuang key levee that was destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In mid-May, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division invaded Liu Zhuang, which belongs to our Nanhua County, and wantonly destroyed the Yellow River key levee there. All the bricks, stones, and wood prepared for emergency repairs were looted, and four bunkers were built between the third and fourth stone dams. Trenches more than ten steps long and two or three feet deep were dug on the third stone dam. All the dam ropes and iron chains woven with iron wire on the key levee were also cut off. Currently, the protective bricks of the second to fifth stone dams have collapsed by several feet, and the protective bricks of the second to third stone dams are about to collapse completely. Once the big flood arrives, there will be breaches. After our army recovered the area, the Nanhua Democratic Government immediately planned to use 1.2 million bricks to repair the key levee, and construction has now begun. (Note: At Liu Zhuang in Nanhua, the Yellow River turns north, and the water is turbulent. It breached on July 7, 1925, inundating Heze, Dancheng, and other places.)

　　蒋匪破坏刘庄险工
  　民主政府积极抢修
    【冀鲁豫二十五日电】民主政府积极抢修被蒋匪破坏之刘庄险工。蒋匪六八师一部于五月中旬侵占我南华县属刘庄，对该地黄河险工大肆破坏。将预置抢险之砖料、石料、木料全部抢走，并在第三石坝与第四石坝间修筑四个碉堡，在第三石坝上挖掘长十余步深二、三尺的沟道。险工上所有坝绳和用铁丝织成的铁链也被割断。现该险工第二石坝至第五石坝之护砖已塌陷数尺，第二至第三石坝之护砖已将塌完。一旦大汛到来，将有决口之处。我军收复该地后，南华民主政府即预定以一百二十万砖抢修该处险工，现已动工。（按：黄河至南华刘庄折向北流，水势湍急，曾在民国十四年七月七日决口，淹及荷泽、郸城等地。）
