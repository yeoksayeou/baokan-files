[Report from Chahar News] In Nan Jie'an and Bei Taiyu in Yi County, to improve the quality of homespun cloth and increase sales, cloth reform has been implemented in villages, allowing the masses to obtain greater profits. Two different approaches have emerged in this work. The textile industry in the Nan Jie'an area is very developed, but some weavers weave inferior cloth for great profit. In recent years, the quality of homespun cloth has been too low, causing sales to decrease. Last spring, the market could offer more than 1,800 bolts of cloth, but later each market could only offer about 1,000 bolts. To restore the textile industry in the Jie'an area, the Xinglong Store and the Fifth District United Cooperative planned to transform the Jie'an cloth shops, improve the quality of cloth, and expand sales.

The reform work began in mid-April, but the leadership made the mistake of being too impatient, planning to completely require weavers to weave reformed cloth within three or four markets, with inferior cloth disappearing completely. First, the store cadres, the director of the district cooperative, and the head of the industry and commerce office, a total of fourteen people, formed a cloth exchange to uniformly purchase homespun cloth. When purchasing began, good cloth was priced seven or eight thousand yuan higher per bolt than the original market price, and weavers could earn about 20,000 yuan per bolt. However, in the second and third markets, cotton prices rose, but cloth prices did not, and weaving a bolt of cloth only yielded a profit of 10,000 yuan. The leadership also adopted a simple downward pressure method for the inferior cloth woven, not allowing the masses to sell it elsewhere, insisting that it be sold to the exchange, and each bolt was 13,000 yuan lower than the market price. As a result, the cloth woven by the masses earned very little, or even lost money. There were also too many people buying cloth, and the sellers were surrounded so tightly that it was impossible to sell. Small vendors gave the money to the exchange and waited for the cloth to be collected, then they would go to buy the cloth. The leftovers were returned to the merchants. In this way, small vendors could buy the cloth cheaper than if they bought it themselves. However, the masses were very dissatisfied, saying that the store was controlling everything, and the number of weavers was decreasing. This reform method, which did not follow the mass line, failed and has now been stopped.

Another method was that the Yangyiyuan Store and the Eighth District United Cooperative made a long-term plan, starting the reform work in February of this year. First, they convened meetings of farmers' associations, women, and cooperative cadres from the surrounding weaving villages, as well as experienced weavers, explained the significance of the reform, and discussed how to reform and the difficulties of reform. Village-level meetings were also convened for weavers and village cadres, explaining the purpose of the reform. The store also sent people to Bei Taiyu, Yangjia Zhuang, Luogou, Tuonan and other villages to conduct investigations and statistics. After understanding the number of weavers who could not resume work, they provided interest-free loans of more than 1,200 jin of capital cotton, enabling 52 looms to resume operation and weave reformed cloth, stipulating that it could be sold freely. As a result, the good cloth woven was sold as soon as it reached the market, and the masses were very satisfied. The masses in Bei Taiyu said, "This is great, now there are people who want our cloth!" In addition, a textile committee was established in the village, with technical guidance and general affairs sections, responsible for managing and supervising the textile work. The textile industry in the four villages of Bei Taiyu, Luogou, Yangjia Zhuang, and Tuonan has been restored to its original state. Out of the 182 looms in the four villages, only 11 have not been started due to a lack of technicians. The quality of the cloth has also been greatly improved, with 80 percent of the cloth now being reformed cloth.

　　易县实行土布改庄
  　质量提高销路增加
    【察哈尔讯】易县南界安、北台鱼两地，为了提高土布质量增加销路，实行土布改庄，使群众得到更多利润。在这一工作中产生了两种不同的做法。南界安一带纺织业很发达，可是有的机织户织歹布取大利，几年来土布质量太低，使销路越来越少，去春上集能上布一千八百多匹，以后每集仅能上一千匹左右。为恢复界安一带的纺织业，在兴隆商店与五区联社计划改造界安布庄，提高布的质量扩大销路。改庄工作于四月中旬开始，领导上犯了急性病，计划在三四个集内完全叫织户织改庄布，歹布绝迹。首先由商店干部与区联社主任、工商所长等十四人组成土布交易所，统一收买土布。在开始收买时，好布每匹比原市价提高了七、八千元，机户每匹能获利二万元左右。但第二、三个集线涨了价，布价未涨，织一匹布仅能获利一万元。领导上对织出的歹布又采取单纯往下压的办法，不让群众到别处卖，定要拿到交易所卖，而每匹布又低于市价一万三千元。因此群众织的布有的赚钱很少，甚至于赔钱。收布时人又多，卖布的围的风雨不透，有的围半天也不定卖了。小商贩把钱交给交易所等布收齐后，他们就去买布。挑剩下的归商户。这样，小商贩比自己买还便宜。但群众非常不满，说商店统制起来了，布户就越来越少，这种非群众路线的改庄办法遭到失败。现在已停止了。另一种办法是养义源商店与八区联社作了长期计划，从今年阳历二月间即着手进行改庄工作，首先召开了周围附近织布村的农会、妇女和合作社干部及对织布有经验户的会议，讲了改庄的意义，讨论如何改庄及改庄的困难等；并以村为单位召开了机户、村干会议，讲了改庄目的。商店并派人到北台鱼、杨家庄、洛沟、坨南等村去进行调查，了解统计了无法复业的机户后，就无利借给了资本线一千二百多斤，使五十二架机子复了业；并织改庄布，规定可自由出卖，结果织出的好布，一到集上就卖了，群众很满意。北台鱼群众说：“这可好了，布有人要了。”此外村中还成立了纺织委员会，下设技术指导与总务等股，负责管理督促纺织工作。北台鱼、洛沟、杨家庄、坨南等四村纺织业已复原状。四村一百八十二张机子，现仅有十一张因缺乏技术人未动起来。布的质量也大大的提高了，已有百分之八十的改庄布。
