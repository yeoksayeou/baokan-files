　　"The Net of Heaven is Hard to Escape"
    —— A Record of the Capture of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan Bandits Xu Qichang and Xie Xichang

    "Capture Liang Peihuang alive, and also capture the two Changs,
    One is Xu Qichang, and the other is Xie Xichang.
    Fight into Linfen city, keep your eyes open,
    Whoever captures them will be a hero and make a name!"
    This battlefront leaflet was widely circulated in various trenches before the general offensive on Linfen. The calls of "Capture Liang Peihuang alive," "Capture Xu Qichang alive," and "Capture Xie Xichang alive" echoed everywhere along with the leaflets. Some soldiers even drew pictures of the three of them, highlighting each person's main characteristics. Liang Peihuang had a small Japanese mustache, Xu Qichang had a round face and a big belly, and Xie Xichang was a small man.

    On the evening of May 17th, after the People's Liberation Army on the Jinan Front captured Linfen City, the battle ended at 12 o'clock that night. However, no one with a Japanese mustache could be found in the entire city. It was not until the next day that our blocking troops captured Liang Peihuang in the wheat field north of Mawu Village, west of the river. When the good news came, everyone was extremely happy. Some said: This is icing on the cake; others said: This is the finishing touch; otherwise, it would be disappointing to completely annihilate the defending enemy without capturing the bandit leader. However, some still felt it was a pity that Xu Qichang and Xie Xichang had not been captured.

    On the 20th and 30th, Xie Xichang and Xu Qichang were captured one after another. Everyone said that this meant no one had escaped the net. In the eyes of Xu Qichang and Xie Xichang, they might have blamed their fate, but in the eyes of our people and the People's Liberation Army – the People's soldiers – it was "the net of heaven is hard to escape." As long as you are in the Kuomintang army selling out the country and engaging in civil war for Chiang Kai-shek, if you do not lay down your weapons, you will be captured even if you run to the ends of the earth, let alone being trapped in the isolated city of Linfen, which is nothing more than a turtle in a jar.

    Xu Qichang, the Major General Commander of the 66th Division of the Yan Xishan bandit army of the Kuomintang army, can be said to be an "escape expert" under the mighty military power of the People's Liberation Army. During the Shangdang Campaign in the autumn of 1945, he had escaped twice from under the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army. The first time was in Tunliu County. At that time, he was the commander of the Yan bandit's Sixth Advance Column, leading a group of lackeys, trapped in Tunliu City. After our General Liu Bocheng's victorious army occupied Tunliu City, he slipped away with his tail between his legs into Changzhi City, trying to find Shi Zebo to save his life. Later, after General Liu Bocheng's victorious army annihilated tens of thousands of Yan bandit reinforcements at Laoye Mountain in Tunliu, Xu Qichang fled with Shi Zebo again, abandoning the city. When they escaped to the Fen River, Shi Zebo was captured, and Xu Qichang luckily escaped again. This time in the Linfen Campaign, he also escaped twice. He also led the 66th Division in charge of defending the East Gate. On April 10th, after our People's Liberation Army captured the East Gate, he escaped into the city through a tunnel. After the People's Liberation Army captured Linfen City, he broke through and fled again. Yan Xishan once ordered his subordinates to advocate the tactic of running away. Xu Qichang can be regarded as one who implemented it most resolutely and skillfully. However, this time after escaping from Linfen City, he finally did not escape the palm of the People's Liberation Army.

    On the evening of May 17th, after the People's Liberation Army captured Linfen City, it quickly broke through the inner moat and advanced rapidly and bravely towards the depths. When they reached the core fortifications in the city, Xu Qichang, behind the Bell and Drum Tower, seeing that the situation was gone, sneaked out through a small door in the west city gate and fled in panic. He ran to the banks of the Fen River, jumped into the river without even taking off his shoes and socks, and his shoes were also stuck. After getting to the west bank, although someone gave him a pair of shoes to wear, the shoes did not fit, and because he was as fat as a pig and panicked in his heart, he could hardly move. At this time, he estimated his situation and found that the pursuers were so close, so he desperately hid in Xia Geduo Village west of the Fen River in Linfen. On the 30th, our mopping-up troops in the west of the river arrived at Xia Geduo Village and immediately found him. Xu Qichang, who had been repeatedly annihilated and repeatedly escaped, was finally captured alive.

    Xie Xichang, the Major General Deputy Brigade Commander of the 30th Reorganized Brigade of the Hu Zongnan bandit army of the Kuomintang army, fled west in one breath after breaking out of Linfen on the evening of the 17th. Along the way, he was blocked by our blocking troops and was beaten to the point of exhaustion. When he fled to the Dongxinangou Village in Niuwangmiao, Xiangning, he could no longer continue to escape. At this time, he only blamed himself for not having two more legs. Just as Xie Xichang was worrying and panting, he did not know that our blocking troops had been waiting for him for a long time. Xie Xichang led more than 130 remnants and defeated soldiers who had lost their souls and were so frightened as mud when they heard the gunshots, and obediently became prisoners. Since then, the 30th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan army trapped in Linfen finally ended its historical fate.

　　“天网难逃”
    ——蒋阎匪徐其昌谢锡昌被俘记
    常登
    “活捉梁培璜，还要捉二昌，
    一个徐其昌，一个谢锡昌。
    打进临汾城，眼睛要放亮，
    谁要捉住了，英雄把名扬”。
    这张战地传单，总攻临汾前，在各个战壕里普遍的传看着。“活捉梁培璜”，“活捉徐其昌”，“活捉谢锡昌”的呼声，也跟着传单到处乱吵着，有些战士更把他们三个人画了出来，每个人的主要特征都画出来了。梁培璜有一撮日本小胡子，徐其昌是个圆脸大肚子，谢锡昌是个小个子。
    五月十七日黄昏，晋南前线的解放军攻进临汾城后，当晚十二时就结束了战斗。可是满城找不着一个蓄日本小胡子的人来。到第二天，我堵击的部队在河西马务村北的麦地里，才把梁培璜捉住了。捷音传来，大家高兴极了，有的说：这是锦上添花；有的说：这是画龙点睛；不然全部歼灭了守敌，没有捉住匪首，怪扫兴的。可是没有把徐其昌和谢锡昌捉住，有的仍感美中不足。
    到二十日和三十日，先后把谢锡昌和徐其昌也捉住了。大家都说，这就无一漏网了，在徐其昌和谢锡昌看来，或许是埋怨自己的命运，但在我们人民和人民子弟兵——解放军看来，却是“天网难逃”。只要你是在国民党军队里为蒋介石卖国内战，你不放下武器，就是跑到天涯海角，也会被捉住的，何况被困临汾孤城，岂不更是瓮中之鳖。
    国民党军阎锡山匪部六十六师少将师长徐其昌，在人民解放军强大兵团的军威之下，可说是一个“逃跑专家”。一九四五年秋天上党战役时，他曾经从解放军的铁拳底下逃跑过两次，第一次是在屯留县城，那时他是阎匪挺进第六纵队司令，带领了一群喽罗，困据屯留城内，我刘伯承将军常胜军攻占屯留城后，他夹着尾巴窜入长治城，企图去找史泽波保命，后来刘伯承将军的常胜军，又在屯留老爷山歼灭阎匪几万援军后，徐其昌又跟着史泽波弃城逃跑了，逃到汾河边，史泽波被俘，徐其昌又侥幸逃脱了。这次临汾战役，他也曾经逃跑两次，他又率领六十六师负责困守东关，四月十日，我人民解放军攻进东关后，他从地道里逃进城里去了，人民解放军攻进临汾城后，他又突围逃跑了。阎锡山曾经明令他的部属，提倡跑的战术，徐其昌算是执行得最坚决，最熟练的一个，可是这次从临汾城里逃跑出来后，终于没有逃出人民解放军的手掌心。
    五月十七日晚上，解放军攻进临汾城后，很快突过了内壕，勇猛迅速的向着纵深发展，打到了城内的核心工事时，钟鼓楼后徐其昌看着大势已去，于是从西城门一个小门缝里钻出去，落荒而逃，跑到汾河两岸，连鞋带袜就跳下河去，鞋子也陷掉了，上到西岸，虽说有人给了他一双鞋穿，但是鞋不合脚，又因身体肥胖如猪，加之心里吓得作慌，那里还走得动，这时他自己估量了一番，追兵又这样紧迫，于是绝望的在临汾河西下圪垛村躲藏起来。到了三十日，我河西清剿部队到了下圪垛村，一下就把他查获了，屡次被歼灭又屡次逃跑的徐其昌，最终还是被活捉了。
    国民党军胡宗南匪部整编三十旅少将副旅长谢锡昌，十七日晚从临汾突围出城后，他一股劲往西逃窜，沿途遭我堵击部队堵击，被打得精疲力竭了，窜到乡宁牛王庙东西南沟村时，再也不能继续逃跑了，这时只怨自己少长了两条腿，谢锡昌正在发愁喘气之际，那知我堵击部队早已在等待着他了，谢锡昌率领失魂丧魄的残兵败将一百三十多人，一听见枪声，便吓得如泥了，乖乖的作了俘虏。自此困守临汾的蒋胡军三十旅，最后结束了自己的历史命运。
