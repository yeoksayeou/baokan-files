　　New democratic culture and education are developing rapidly in Weifang City. On May 14th, the city's Education Bureau held a forum for the local education community. At the meeting, colleagues in the education field unanimously expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to education under the leadership of the democratic government and initiated the establishment of a "New Democratic Education Research Association" to jointly study new educational guidelines and teaching methods. Up to now, more than 250 people have participated in the research every day, including principals, faculty members, and teachers who had stopped teaching during the Kuomintang rule and now wish to teach again. The Weifang branch of the Xinhua Bookstore sold more than 800 copies of various theoretical books in just a few days after its opening. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and "The Outline Land Law of China" are selling the best. A large number of exquisitely bound "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" transported from the new Bohai area were snapped up in less than three days. The Municipal People's Education Center has been formally established, and there are three public reading rooms in the urban area, with an average of more than 600 people visiting each day. The Municipal People's Education Center and the East China Pictorial recently jointly held two photo exhibitions, one featuring photos of the East China Liberation Army's battles in the central and western sections of the Jiaoji Railway, and the other featuring photos of production and construction in Yan'an. Visitors flocked to the exhibitions all day long. The Cultural Troupe of a certain column of the East China Liberation Army has been performing the famous play "Blood and Tears of Hatred" at the Yongle Grand Theater since the 18th, with an audience of 1,500 people every day.
