Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, 5th -- The People's Liberation Army's East China Corps has victoriously concluded its new-style military training movement. The technology of the entire army has greatly improved, and the atmosphere is completely renewed. The basic advantages of this training movement of the Corps are the combination of leadership and the masses, and the combination of ideological education and technical education. The class consciousness of the soldiers after the "Three Check-ups" guaranteed the success of technical education, and the skilled techniques after the training consolidated the ideological education of the "Three Check-ups." Due to the leadership's boldness in letting go and the ability to utilize military education democracy, there have been new improvements in the organizational form and implementation methods of education. Each level of educational unit has established a Military Education Committee, Military Education Group, Military Education Small Group, etc., absorbing technically skilled lower-level cadres and soldiers to participate. For example, the director of the Study Committee of the 4th Company of a certain unit was the squad leader of the 3rd Squad, while the company commander served as the deputy director. During the education process, the wisdom of the masses was actively brought into play, and the specific progress and steps of the education plan were discussed democratically. In terms of educational methods, the "little teacher" system was adopted, implementing soldier teaching soldier, officer teaching officer, and officers and soldiers teaching each other. For example, Huang Keyu, a machine gun squad soldier from a certain regiment, had cadres also attending his lectures. His lecture performance was very good, and he became the machine gun instructor for the entire regiment. A new recruit in a certain unit who had never fired a gun before won first place in the entire company in target shooting after this training movement, and the entire company invited him to talk about how he hit the target. Conversely, those who cannot put down their airs, are afraid of embarrassment, and dare not mobilize the wisdom and talents of the soldiers and masses, sticking to the old ways, are not welcomed. Soldiers of a certain battalion reflected on a leader with such a style, saying: "The battalion commander worked hard to speak for three hours, but we couldn't understand even if we listened attentively." Facts have proven that this large-scale military training has paid attention to discovering the talents of the masses, and the vivid educational method of typical cultivation has brought a new vigor and a spirit of hard study to the troops, brought into play the initiative of the soldiers, and produced many technical talents and reserve cadres, greatly solving the difficulties of cadres and teaching materials, enabling education to be carried out comprehensively and deeply. Even transport personnel, cooks, and animal caretakers who rarely had the opportunity to receive education in the past, as well as technical and administrative cadres in the organs, participated in this training movement without exception. Preliminary summary of the results of technical training for the entire corps: the average hand grenade throwing record is 35 meters, an increase of about 10 meters compared to the past, with the highest record reaching 50 meters. In live ammunition shooting, the number of misses in the entire army is less than one percent, and various close-range weapons and rapid close-quarters operation forms have been invented. Now, based on these achievements, the commanders and fighters of the entire corps are full of the victorious determination to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and liberate all of China.

　　华东兵团完成新式练兵运动
  　全军技术提高气象一新
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线五日电】华东人民解放军某兵团，已胜利结束新式练兵运动，全军技术大为提高，气象焕然一新。该兵团此次练兵运动的基本优点，是领导与群众结合，思想教育与技术教育结合。三查后，战士中的阶级觉悟，保证了技术教育的成功，而练兵后熟练的技术，又巩固了三查的思想教育。由于领导上敢于放手和能运用军事教育民主的结果，使教育的组织形式及实行的方式方法，都有了新的改进。各级教育单位，分设军事教育委员会，军教组，军教小组等形式，吸收技术熟练的下级干部和战士参加。如某部四连的学委会主任，由第三班班长担任，而连长则任副主任。在教育进行中，积极的发挥了群众的智慧，民主讨论教育计划的具体进度和步骤；教育方法上，采用小先生制，实行兵教兵、官教官、官兵互教。如某团机枪班战士黄克裕，讲课时干部也去听，他讲课成绩很好，就成为全团的机枪教员。某部一个过去从未打过枪的新参军战士，经过这次练兵运动，打靶成绩荣获全连第一，全连就请他讲一次他是怎样打中靶的。相反的，那些放不下架子，怕难为情，不敢发动战士群众的智慧与才能，啃着老一套作风的人，却不受欢迎。某营战士，对于一个象这样作风的领导者的反映说：营长辛苦的讲了三个钟头，可是我们用心也听不懂。事实证明这次大练兵，注意发现群众天才，采取典型培养的生动教育方法，已给部队带来了新的朝气及奋发的学习情绪，发挥了战士的积极性，涌现了许多技术人才和后备干部，大大地解决了干部与教材的困难，使教育能全面开展，深入甚至从来很少得到教育机会的运输员、炊事员、饲养员，机关中技术工作与事务工作干部也无例外地参加了这次练兵运动。全兵团技术锻炼成绩的初步总结：手榴弹投掷纪录平均三十五米，比过去普遍增进十米左右，其最高纪录达五十米。实弹射击全军脱靶的比数不到百分之一，并发明了多种近战武器和迅速的近迫作业形式。现全兵团指战员在这些成就的基础上，充满着消灭蒋介石匪军，解放全中国的胜利的决心。
