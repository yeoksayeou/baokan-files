Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – People in the KMT-controlled areas, threatened by soaring prices and famine, have repeatedly erupted in rice-seizing disturbances. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 16th, in Ningbo, the terminus of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, when the price of rice rose to 13 million KMT currency per dan (unit of weight), the poor rose up to seize rice, and the disturbance lasted for five hours. Furthermore, a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th stated that on the 15th, in Wujin (Changzhou), Jiangsu, a rice-producing area, the poor also erupted in rice-seizing disturbances due to the price of rice rising to 12.8 million KMT currency per dan. The KMT police opened fire on the starving people and arrested many, mostly women and children, but the disturbance did not subside all day. According to news from KMT-controlled newspapers, Wuhu, Anhui, one of the four major rice markets, also had hundreds of starving people seizing grain on the 9th of last month due to the habitual rise in rice prices.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th – Shanghai News reports: The struggle of peasants near Suzhou, Jiangsu, against the KMT bandits' arbitrary rent collection and indiscriminate arrest of tenant farmers has expanded. Following the destruction of three "rent collection stations" in Huangdai, northwest of Suzhou, by five or six hundred peasants on May 8th, on May 17th, more than 500 peasants in Xiangcheng District, northeast of Suzhou, also rushed into the rent collection station in that district, rescued the detained tenant farmers, and destroyed the sundries in the station. Under the savage suppression of the local military police, more than ten tenant farmers were arrested again.
