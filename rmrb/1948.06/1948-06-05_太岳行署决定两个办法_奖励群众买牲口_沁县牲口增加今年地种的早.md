　　Taiyue Administrative Office Decides on Two Methods
　　Reward the Masses for Buying Livestock
　　Increased Livestock in Qin County Results in Early Planting This Year
　　[Taiyue News] In order to encourage the masses to raise more livestock, the Taiyue Administrative Office recently decided on two reward methods: (1) To encourage livestock breeding and enable the masses to buy more livestock and increase production, this year's new burden-sharing method specifically stipulates that those who buy livestock after this year's burden-sharing will be deducted one-third of the purchase price when sharing the burden. The deduction will be calculated at market price in terms of grain. (2) To reward livestock raising households, a portion of feed will be deducted when sharing the burden. The deduction method stipulates: For mules and horses that can cultivate land and work diligently, deduct 8 dou of grain each; for cattle and donkeys, deduct 5 dou each; for mules and horses that can only cultivate land but not work diligently, deduct 5 dou of grain each; for cattle and donkeys, deduct 3 dou each.
　　[Taiyue News] Due to the eight or nine years of large-scale looting and killing by the Japanese invaders and Yan bandit Yin Bingchang, Qin County suffered a great loss of draught animals. Over the past few years, with the planned assistance of the democratic government and the Jinnan Bank, it has gradually recovered. From last winter to this spring, Zhongguang alone increased its livestock by more than 1,000 head. After the Jinnan Bank released 60 million yuan in loans last year, it systematically organized the masses to produce and earn money to buy livestock. According to a recent survey, this loan alone purchased 612 head of livestock. This spring, when various places were holding mule and horse fairs, the Jinnan Bank timely released another 77 million yuan in loans, and many people bought livestock. Therefore, many places in Qin County planted crops early this year.

　　太岳行署决定两个办法
    奖励群众买牲口
  　沁县牲口增加今年地种的早
    【太岳消息】太岳行署为了叫群众多喂牲口，最近决定了两个奖励办法：（一）为了奖励繁殖牲畜，使群众多买牲口多生产，今年新负担办法上特规定，凡在本年办负担以后买上牲口，办负担时给扣除买价三分之一，扣除时按市价折谷计算。（二）为了奖励养牲口户，办负担时给扣除饲料一部分。扣除办法规定：凡是能耕种土地而又能服勤的骡马，各扣谷子八斗，牛驴五斗；只能种地不能服勤的骡马，各扣谷子五斗，牛驴三斗。
    【太岳消息】被日寇和阎匪殷丙昌八九年的大抢大杀，沁县的畜力损失很大，光南底永一村就被抢被杀五十多头。几年来经民主政府和冀南银行有计划的帮助，逐渐恢复，中光去年冬天到今年春天，就增加了牲口一千多头。冀南银行在去年放出六千万元贷款后，就有计划的组织群众生产赚钱买牲口。据最近调查，靠这笔款就买下了牲口六百十二头。今年春天各地正赶骡马大会时，冀南银行又及时放出七千七百万元贷款，许多群众都买牲口，所以沁县今年很多地方早早的把庄稼种上了。
