Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 9th. The selection of the first "Executive Yuan" after Chiang Kai-shek's "constitutional rule" has encountered difficulties due to the severe military and economic crisis of the Chiang family's court, and the further disintegration of factions within the Kuomintang. In order to organize this "constitutional cabinet," Chiang Kai-shek, from May 20th to 24th, looked around and, according to the intentions of the American government, promoted Weng Wenhao, who is close to the Political Science Clique, to be the President of the Executive Yuan. Weng Wenhao, with the help of his masters, managed to put together a team and took office on the 2nd of this month. American news agencies stated that Weng Wenhao was able to become the President of the Executive Yuan because he "has the qualifications to cooperate with the US aid program to China," "has experience in Sino-American cooperation," "is a close friend of Song Ziwen," and "is the only person who meets the requirements other than Song Ziwen." Weng Wenhao's opening remarks after taking office were honest and straightforward: "We must foster good relations." He said that he would "sincerely discuss and make good use" of the US imperialist plan to aid Chiang in destroying China, in order to "repay the good intentions of friendly countries in assisting and supporting us" (Central News Agency). The Vice President of Weng Wenhao is Gu Mengyu, who recently returned from the United States. The new Minister of National Defense, He Yingqin, was previously kicked aside by the Americans and replaced by Chen Cheng, but now he has been picked up again by the Americans to replace Chen Cheng. He Yingqin returned from the United States only when this pseudo "National Assembly" opened. In his conversation with American reporters after taking office, he said: "In the past, we did not fully utilize the opinions provided by the American advisory group. I plan to improve liaison work and take other steps to ensure that the American advisory group's methods for modernizing training troops can be fully applied."

　　蒋党内部更加分崩离析
  　“行宪内阁”遭遇难产
    翁文灏按照其美国主子意旨上台
    【新华社陕北九日电】蒋介石“行宪”后第一任“行政院”的人选，因蒋家朝廷军事经济危机严重，蒋党内部更加分崩离析，使这第一任的“行宪内阁”遭遇难产。蒋介石为了组织这一个“行宪内阁”，从五月二十日到二十四日，东张西望，按美国政府的意图，抬出一个亲政学系的翁文灏来作行政院长。翁文灏又经过主子才把班子凑齐，于本月二日登场。美国通讯社称：翁文灏之所以能作行政院长，是因为他“具有资格，足以与美国对华援助计划合作”，“在中美合作方面有经验”，“是宋子文的密友”和“宋子文以外唯一符合条件的人”。翁文灏登台后的开场白，就老老实实说：“要敦睦邦交”。对美帝国主义援蒋灭华的计划要“开诚商洽，善为运用”，以此来“报偿友邦辅助匡襄的好意”（中央社）。翁文灏的副院长是不久以前由美回国的顾孟余。新的国防部长何应钦，从前曾被美国人踢开，代以陈诚，现在又被美国人检起来代替陈诚。何应钦在这次伪“国大”开幕时，才由美回国。他在就职后对美记者的谈话中说：“过去我们没有充分利用美国顾问团提供的意见，我打算改进联络工作，并采取其他步骤，保证美国顾问团关于现代化训练军队的方法，得以充分应用”。
