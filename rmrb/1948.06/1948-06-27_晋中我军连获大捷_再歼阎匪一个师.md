　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong Front, 25th -- Following the great victory of annihilating the 72nd Division of the Yan's troops on the 21st, our Jinzhong front achieved another great victory on the 24th, annihilating one division of Yan's 40th Division and a part of other Yan's troops. Wen Huaiguang, the commander of the 19th Army of Yan's troops, originally stationed in Pingyao, led the entire 40th Division, newly transferred from Taiyuan, the entire 72nd Division, and a part of the local armed self-defense force from Pingyao north to Qi County on the 23rd. After traveling only a dozen miles, they were ambushed by our forces in the Hongshan area. By the 24th, except for a small number who escaped, they were completely annihilated by us. The battle results are currently being verified.
　　It is reported that the North China First Field Army and a part of the Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army, after capturing Linfen on May 17th and resting briefly, went north along the Hui-Pu Road to the Jinzhong area to conduct operations. The local armed forces in the Jinzhong area also actively participated. From the 11th to the 24th of this month, the Yan Xishan bandit troops entrenched in the narrow area of ​​only fourteen county towns encountered the following important events during this period: (1) They withdrew from Lingshi on the 11th, and the city was recovered by us on the 12th. (2) On the 14th, the 34th Army under Gao Zhuozhi and the 70th Division, along with parts of local militias, attacked west of Xiaoyi from the Fenyang-Xiaoyi line to loot grain. They were intercepted by our forces. After a day of fierce fighting, they were repelled by us, with approximately 1,200 killed, wounded, and captured. After this blow, the 34th Army retreated east to Jiexiu on the Tongpu Railway. (3) On the 18th, the entire 70th Division and local armed forces attacked north from Wenshui to loot grain. They were intercepted by our forces, and their division commander, Hou Fujun, and division chief of staff, Liu Chengji, were killed. Approximately 800 were killed, wounded, and captured. (4) On the 21st, the 72nd Division, newly transferred south from Taiyuan, was completely annihilated by us north of Zhanglan (previously mistakenly reported as Changlan) while retreating from Jiexiu back to Pingyao. On the 23rd, the 40th Division, newly transferred south from Taiyuan, and a part of other armed forces were ambushed by us north of Hongshan while retreating from Pingyao back to Qi County, and were annihilated by the morning of the 24th.
