[Taiyue News] Jiangli Village in Yangcheng firmly corrected the deviation of harming middle peasants, compensated wrongly struggled middle peasants, resettled landlords and rich peasants who had been swept out of their homes, and solved their production difficulties, achieving united production to overcome the spring famine.

A severe spring famine threatened Jiangli Village, making it impossible to fully invest in production. Of the 626 households in the village, 155 households did not have enough grain to last until the summer harvest, and 121 households were on the verge of starvation. The grain-deficient households were mainly of three types: one type was poor and tenant peasants who had not thoroughly turned over, and waited for equal distribution last winter, resulting in not doing a good job in winter production; one type was middle peasants who were wrongly struggled or under control and were unable to carry out winter production; and one type was landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes.

There were two main reasons for the severe spring famine: 1. Natural disasters: there was a drought in May and June of last year, and planting was too late. In autumn, there was continuous rain, and the crops turned green again. The overall harvest was 40 to 60 percent less than in a normal year. 2. Man-made losses: In the past, two-thirds of the male full laborers in Jiangli Village went out to carry burdens or engage in workshop sideline businesses in winter, always "running for a winter to eat for a spring," partially supplementing the shortage of agricultural production. Last winter, some poor peasants waited for equal distribution and did not go out to produce. Some middle peasants wanted to go out to produce, but could not get road passes. Some were afraid of struggle, "living one day at a time," and were unwilling to go out to produce even if they had capital.

People's production enthusiasm was not high, mainly because the middle peasants were seriously hurt. In the mass movements of previous years, in addition to the 17 landlords and rich peasants who were struggled against, another 74 middle peasants were struggled against. The middle peasants said, "A raised pile is a target, having money means trouble." Some said, "We are harmful first, beneficial later." Some said, "Our priority is to save our lives, money doesn't matter." They had no intention of producing, and the spring famine was relatively more serious.

When the call to lead the masses in spring plowing began, some people were lazy and did not want to move, and some people wanted to move, but said, "We have nothing to eat right now, we can't get through the day, so there's nothing we can do." After in-depth investigation and research, it was found that the problem of spring famine was entangled with the problem of wrongly struggling against middle peasants, making the situation seem very complicated. If we want to carry out a vigorous production movement, we must implement the correction of deviations in the organization of production and disaster relief, and resolutely correct deviations to promote spring plowing production.

First, a meeting of poor peasants, Party members, and cadres was convened to break down the ideological obstacles to uniting middle peasants.

At the meeting, it was revealed that some bad cadres were engaging in private gain at public expense and personal revenge in the mass movement and winter production, which was not in line with the thinking of the majority of poor peasants. After a heated and in-depth discussion, the opinions of those bad cadres were isolated, and the correct opinions prevailed. Then, a mass meeting was held to announce the policy toward middle peasants, and the things that had been confiscated from the wrongly struggled middle peasant Yang Kaoxuan that had not yet been distributed were returned on the spot. The whole audience was excited, and the middle peasants said, "This is the policy of Chairman Mao." The poor peasants said, "This is what we think." The middle peasants began to untie the knots in their hearts.

When carrying out the actual disaster relief and deviation correction work, the government issued 3.1 million yuan (Ji currency) in production loans, combined with more than 4.9 million yuan of floating capital in the village, to 189 newly organized surplus laborers for various sideline productions. Wrongly struggled middle peasants and poor peasants have the same right to obtain loans. Landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes also received certain loans. The twelve stones of loan grain and relief grain were completely distributed to the grain-deficient households who had no rice to cook, of which two-fifths were for wrongly struggled middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes. Relief grain was issued to all those who are currently in difficulty and will not be able to repay in the future. Loan grain was issued to those who are currently in difficulty and will be able to repay in the future. Only loan grain was issued to landlords and rich peasants, in order to help them produce well and avoid them from continuing to loaf around. The wages underpaid or unpaid to wrongly struggled middle peasants in mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and other control institutions were decided to be repaid immediately by cadres and middle peasants. If poor peasants are unable to repay immediately, they will be temporarily repaid from public fruits and resolved uniformly in the future.

As a result of the implementation of these compensation methods, the wrongly struggled middle peasants fully understood that they would no longer be discriminated against economically and politically in the future, and they were happy. The middle peasants who had not been struggled against knew that they would not be struggled against in the future, and they were also happy. The wrongly struggled middle peasant Yang Kaosheng said, "The Eighth Route Army is practical, and today is practical. I always thought that there would be this day! And this day has come." A middle peasant told his wife while cooking, "Put it in evenly! Don't waste it like you used to." After correcting deviations and providing disaster relief in Jiangli, the middle peasants were at ease, and the whole village united to produce.

### 阳城匠礼村坚决纠正损害中农偏向　团结生产渡过春荒

　　阳城匠礼村坚决纠正损害中农偏向
  　团结生产渡过春荒
    【太岳讯】阳城匠礼村坚决纠正损害中农的偏向，补偿了错斗中农，安置了被扫地出门的地主富农，给他们解决了生产困难后，达到团结生产渡过春荒。
    严重的春荒威胁着匠礼村，无法全力投入生产。全村六百二十六户，吃粮接不到夏收的有一百五十五户，眼下就要断炊的有一百二十一户。缺粮户主要是三种人：一种是翻身不彻底，去年冬天等平分，以致没有搞好冬季生产的贫雇农。一种是被错斗或被管制未能进行冬季生产的中农，一种是被扫地出门的地主富农。
    春荒严重的原因有两个：一、天灾：去年五、六月天旱不雨，下种过迟。秋季却连绵大雨，庄稼回青。整个收成比一般年景要少百分之四十到六十。二、人为的损失：过去匠礼村在冬天有三分之二的男全劳力出外担挑，或搞作坊副业，总是“跑一冬吃一春”，部分补充农业生产的不足，去年冬天有些贫农等平分，不外出生产。中农有的想外出生产，但得不到路条。有的怕斗争，“过一天吃一天”，有本钱也不愿意出去生产。
    人们生产情绪不高，主要是因为严重的伤害了中农。在历年的群众运动中，除了十七户地主富农被斗外，另有七十四户中农被斗争。中农们说：“圪堆高出目标，有钱就有事”。有的说：“咱们是有害在先，有利在后。”有的说“咱们保命第一，钱不钱没啥。”他们都没有心思生产，春荒相对的更严重了。
    开始号召，领导群众春耕时，有人懒懒的不想动，有人很想动，但是说：“当下没吃的，当天过不去，啥也没法提”。经过深入的调查研究，发现春荒和错斗中农的问题纠缠起来，事情显得很复杂。要想开展一个有力的生产运动，必须在组织生产救灾中贯彻纠偏，坚决纠偏以推进春耕生产。
    先召开了贫雇、党员和干部的会议，打破团结中农的思想障碍。
    会上暴露了有些坏干部在群运中及冬季生产中假公济私，个人报复，和大多数贫雇的思想不对头。经过热烈深入的讨论，那些坏干部的意见孤立了，正派意见占了上风。接着召开群众大会，宣布中农政策，当场退还了被斗中农杨考轩已被没收还未分配的东西。一时全场兴奋，中农说：“这才见了毛主席的政策。”贫雇农说：“这是咱的心思对。”中农们的疙瘩开始解开了。
    进行实际的救灾纠偏工作时，政府发放了三百一十万元（冀钞，下同）的生产贷款，结合村中一部游资共四百九十余万元，贷给新组织起来的一百八十九个剩余劳力，进行各种副业生产。错斗中农和贫雇有取得贷款的同样权利。被扫地出门的地主富农也得到一定的贷款。十二石贷粮和救济粮完全分给眼下没米下锅的缺粮户身上，其中有五分之二为错斗中农和扫地出门的地主富农。凡是现在困难将来又没有偿还能力的，都发了救济粮。现在困难将来能够偿还的发了贷粮。地主富农只发贷粮，这是为了帮助他们好好生产，避免他们继续游手好闲。互助组、合作社和其他管制机构中少付或未付给错斗中农的工资，决定凡干部和中农短欠的，设法立即偿还，贫农无力立即归还的，暂由公共果实内代为偿还，将来统一解决。
    这些补偿方法施行的结果，被错斗的中农完全晓得了今后经济上、政治上再不会受到什么歧视，高兴了。未被斗争的中农知道以后不会再被斗争，也高兴了。错斗中农杨考生说：“八路军讲实际哩，今天就实际啦。我早就想总会有这一天吧！这一天就来了。”一个中农做饭时告他老婆说：“匀匀的下吧！可别象过去那样子浪费了。”匠礼在纠偏救灾后，中农都安心了，全村团结生产起来了。（本报据匠礼村工作组材料整理）
