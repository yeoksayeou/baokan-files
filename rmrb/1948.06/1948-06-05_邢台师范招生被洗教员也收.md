　　Xingtai Normal School Recruits Cleansed Teachers
    [Xingtai News] On May 20th, the Taihang First Military Sub-district held a middle school education conference at Xingtai Normal School. Based on the new education policy and the actual situation, the conference studied the issue of enrollment during the wheat harvest break. The conference corrected the problem of excessively emphasizing class background and neglecting education during last year's enrollment. It was also decided to re-invite elementary school teachers who were wrongly cleansed by various counties last year, actively help them with ideological transformation and improvement, study policies, and clarify the concept and future of serving the people. Due to the limited number of publicly funded students, Xingtai Normal School will temporarily recruit one class for a three-month study period (tentative). After completion, they will be reassigned to appropriate jobs. (One copy)
