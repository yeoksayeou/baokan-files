Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, the Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Command have issued an urgent directive urging all localities to accelerate planting and summer cultivation, and to actively prepare for the summer harvest. The directive stated: In the past six months, the people of the Border Region have overcome various difficulties such as shortages of grain, seeds, farm implements, labor, livestock, and disease, and have eliminated 60% of fallow land, which is a major achievement in this year's agricultural production. However, there is still a distance from the goal of eliminating fallow land, and the farming of cultivated land is also rougher than in previous years. In addition, some areas do not pay enough attention to production and disaster relief, and many areas have suffered from frost disasters, so the struggle against disasters remains a difficult task in the future. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Rush to plant millet, buckwheat, and autumn vegetables to make up for the losses caused by the frost disaster. (2) Speed up hoeing and fine hoeing to make up for the losses of rough and sparse planting. (3) Harvest summer fields quickly and thoroughly, without letting a single grain be lost. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, all localities should: (1) Accept the experience of spring plowing, mainly relying on mass mutual aid, adjustment, borrowing, and lending to solve difficulties such as rations, seeds, and farm implements. (2) Organize more voluntary small-scale labor exchange teams to give full play to the effectiveness of male and female labor, migrant labor, and idle and vagrant labor. (3) Implement concrete leadership, cadres should personally take action, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, absorb typical experiences and promote them comprehensively, and conduct inspections and supervisions at all levels, and implement rewards and punishments according to the quality of work. (4) Local armed forces in the border areas should actively encircle the enemy and protect the people's production. (5) Staff of organs and troops should try their best to spare time to help military dependents and families of martyrs who lack labor in their stationed areas to carry out rush planting, rush hoeing, rush harvesting, and other production.

　　西北发布联合指示
  　加紧抢种开展夏耕
    【新华社西北十三日电】陕甘宁边区政府，中共西北中央局，陕甘宁晋绥联防军区司令部，顷发出紧急指示，督促各地加紧抢种开展夏耕，及积极准备夏收。指示称：半年来边区人民，克服粮食种籽农具劳力畜力及疾病等种种困难，已消灭了熟荒百分之六十，这是今年农业生产一个重大成绩。但目前与消灭熟荒的目标尚有一距离，而在已耕作之土地中，作务亦较往年粗糙，加以部分地区领导上对生产渡荒重视不足，许多地区又遭冻灾，所以与灾荒作斗争仍是今后艰巨任务。为此必须：（一）抢种糜子荞麦及秋菜，以补救冻灾的损失。（二）加紧抢锄细锄，补救粗种少种的损失。（三）夏田抢收快打，不让颗粒丢弃，为保证上述任务的完成，各地即应：（１）接受春耕经验，主要依靠群众互助调剂借贷，解决口粮籽种及农具等困难。（２）多组织自愿结合的小型变工扎工，高度发挥男女劳力，移民劳力，及闲游流浪劳力的效用。（３）贯彻具体领导，干部亲自动手，及时发现解决问题，吸取典型经验推广全面，层层检查督促，按照工作优劣实行奖惩。（４）边沿区地方武装，积极围困敌人，保护群众生产。（５）机关部队工作人员，应尽量抽暇帮助驻地缺乏劳动力的军工烈属等，进行抢种抢锄抢收，以及其他生产。
