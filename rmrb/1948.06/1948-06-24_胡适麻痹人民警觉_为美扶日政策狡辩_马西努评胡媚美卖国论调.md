Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd – Moscow Radio broadcast on the 11th Ma Xinu's commentary on Hu Shih's pro-American and treacherous arguments defending the U.S. policy of supporting Japan. Following the statement by John Leighton Stuart, which was unanimously protested by patriotic people from all walks of life in China for interfering in the Chinese patriotic movement, which was issued on the 4th of this month, Hu Shih hurriedly issued a statement through the Central News Agency on the 5th, echoing Stuart and openly expressing that "he agrees with the ambassador's opinion," and repeating Stuart's slander of the patriotic movement, saying that "excessive worry and fear" about Japan's economic recovery "is a mistake." Ma Xinu's commentary stated: Just as university professors and students in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places were vehemently denouncing Stuart's statement, Hu Shih published a contrary opinion, attempting to defend the revival of Japanese militarism. It is not surprising that Hu Shih did not cite any facts to prove his views, because the facts would reveal the truth of his distorting reality. The joint statement of more than 280 people from Chinese cultural and industrial circles published by Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao earlier this month exposed various facts of the United States' fostering the revival of Japanese militarism. The statement pointed out that as long as the international situation changes, Japanese industry will quickly turn into military industry and re-invade the Asian continent. Ma Xinu said: All of this is of course well known to Hu Shih. The reason why he deliberately disregards the facts and attempts to quibble that Japan seems to have been demilitarized and that there is no danger of Japanese aggressors reviving is to paralyze the vigilance of the Chinese people in order to help the revival of Japanese militarism. In a conversation with Chinese newspaper reporters on March 25, Hu Shih openly declared: "The destruction of Germany and the defeat of Japan are the two major tragedies of the 20th century." In the eyes of people like Hu Shih, the liberation of the people of Europe and Asia from the bloody oppression of German fascism and Japanese militarism is the so-called "two major tragedies of the 20th century." They openly expressed regret over the collapse of the Japanese oppressive system because they believed that German and Japanese fascism were the main pillars of the world's reactionaries enslaving the people of all countries, so they are now so enthusiastic about helping the United States realize its Japanese militarist plan.

　　胡适麻痹人民警觉
  　为美扶日政策狡辩
    ——马西努评胡媚美卖国论调
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科电台十一日广播马西努对胡适为美国扶日政策辩护的媚美卖国论调的评论。遭受中国各界爱国人士一致抗议的司徒雷登干涉中国爱国运动的声明于本月四日发表后，五日胡适即连忙经过中央社发表谈话予以应和，公开表示“渠赞同大使意见”，并重复司徒对爱国运动的诬蔑说：对日本经济复兴“过分忧虑与恐惧是错误的”。马西努评论略称：正当上海、南京、北京、天津各地大学教授和学生纷纷痛斥司徒声明时，胡适却发表了一种相反的意见，力图为复兴日本军国主义辩护。胡适没有举出任何事实证明自己的见解，这是不足奇怪的，因为事实会揭露他曲解实际的真象。本月初上海大公报公布的中国文化界和实业界二百八十余人的共同声明，即揭露了美国扶植日本军国主义复活的各项事实。该声明指出：只要国际情势一发生变动，日本工业很快会变成军事工业，重新向亚洲大陆进攻。马西努说：这一切当然都是胡适所熟知的。他之所以有意不顾事实，企图诡辩日本似乎已经非军国主义化，再没有日本侵略者复活的危险，是为了麻痹中国人民的警觉心，以此帮助日本军国主义的复活。胡适在三月二十五日对中国报纸记者的谈话中，曾公开宣称：“德国的毁灭和日本的失败是二十世纪的两大悲剧”。在胡适这样的人看来，欧洲和亚洲人民从德国法西斯和日本军国主义血腥压迫下解放出来，就是所谓“二十世纪的两大悲剧”。他们对日本压迫制度的崩溃，公开表示惋惜，因为他们认为德日法西斯曾是世界反动派奴役各国人民的主要支柱，所以他们现时会这样热心帮助美国日本军国主义计划的实现。
