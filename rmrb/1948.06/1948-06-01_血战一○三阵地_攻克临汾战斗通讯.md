　　Bloody Battle for Position 103
  　Battle Communiqué on the Capture of Linfen

　　Enemy position No. 103, outside Linfen's east gate, controlled the outer moat and access to the city walls once captured. But this was a relatively strong enemy fortification. Hundreds and thousands of eyes and hearts were focused on and concerned about the attack on this important position.

　　Regimental Commander Kang personally went to the Fifth Company to mobilize the troops. Everyone wrote guarantees to the regiment and challenged the neighboring units, guaranteeing to "attack and hold." It was decided that the Seventh and Ninth Squads would be the assault squads. The Seventh Squad's deputy had just returned from the hospital but requested to join the demolition team, guaranteeing to complete the demolition mission. First Squad soldier Yang Falu said, "Squad leader, even if there's only one person left, we'll complete the mission!" First Squad Leader Lang Xinhui was very pleased to hear this and immediately convened a meeting of the entire squad, mobilizing everyone: "Even if there's only one of us left in our squad, we'll complete the mission." Seventh Squad Leader Ge Yuzeng and Ninth Squad Leader Geng Lirong gathered their squads to draw maps on the ground, studying what to do if they encountered the enemy's "one" shaped trenches, "T" shaped trenches, or "Y" shaped trenches. The Third Squad was busy digging tunnels, digging more than ten meters in one night. Everyone looked at the terrain again and again, some greedily looking at it six or seven times.

　　Each person carried twenty grenades, as well as explosive packs, tying them all up with ropes and slinging them over their bodies. Lang Xinhui carried twenty-five alone, and because he had no ropes or bomb bags, he untied his own underpants to tie them up.

　　The tunnels and concealed passages were all constructed, the firepower was all in place, and the brigade and regimental leaders were still not at ease, encouraging everyone: "We're counting on you Fifth Company for this one!"

　　At seven o'clock on the fourth, as the sun was setting, our artillery blossomed on position No. 103. At this moment, the assault team dug open the entrance to the sortie tunnel. With a loud bang, the explosion shook the earth. The Seventh and Ninth Squads rushed out from the two tunnel entrances. The Ninth Squad's action was slightly delayed. Seventh Squad Leader Ge Yuzeng, quick as a flash, led his entire squad immediately across the Ninth Squad and climbed onto the position, rushing towards the right flank trench. Ahead was the enemy's defensive pillbox. Duan Yuming was the first to go up and immediately sacrificed himself. The entire squad was wounded. A sense of responsibility motivated Squad Leader Ge Yuzeng. Although he was also wounded, he threw several grenades and continued to advance. He encountered Deputy Squad Leader Liu Yinzhang. The two rushed forward again. The squad leader was wounded a second time. Only Liu Yinzhang was left - the old combat model Liu Yinzhang, who had been in the hospital for nine months, had only returned the day before yesterday - he thought: "There's an enemy light machine gun in the pillbox ahead, and an enemy heavy machine gun behind. If we don't eliminate them, we'll lose the opportunity, and more people will die if they come up from behind. I must persevere." He rushed towards the pillbox, stuffed in two grenades, plus an explosive pack. The defensive pillbox collapsed, but the enemy had long been scared away. Liu Yinzhang rushed to the edge of the forward embankment, persevering until the Third Squad came up, and he finally breathed a sigh of relief, joining the Third Squad in combat. When the neighboring unit didn't come up, they quickly developed northward to meet the neighboring unit. First Squad Leader Lang Xinhui stood at the forefront of the two squads, leading his entire squad to rush towards the left flank trench. Like a whirlwind, they crossed the Ninth Assault Squad and quickly reached the edge of the city moat. The mission was completed, and the enemy was eliminated. The First Squad fought very hard. Yang Falu was the only one left in the entire squad, but he was still fighting. The First and Third Platoons had both come up, and they continued to expand the victory and consolidate the position.

　　Position No. 103 was occupied, and we also controlled the neighboring area.

　　We have to defend it tomorrow during the day! The engineering school needs to be rebuilt! A tense atmosphere surrounded the position. People were frantically busy, doors were jumping, sacks were flying, you came, I went, shovels were roaring, picks were screaming, time was like a treasure. Everyone knew that a minute of slack would cause great harm! People were shouting in low voices, frantically wielding shovels and picks, "Quick, quick, quick, come quickly, doors, sacks!" But the position was already in ruins, destroyed by our explosives and shells beyond recognition. It was not easy to construct a good fortification. But after a few hours, dawn broke, and our fortifications were built on this ruin. Although not satisfactory, it was indeed the crystallization of the soldiers' blood, sweat, and perseverance.

　　At eight o'clock in the morning, the enemy's counterattack came. After a burst of artillery fire and machine gun fire, grenades and phosphorus incendiary bombs were thrown onto our position.

　　Second Squad Deputy Zhao Runming saw the enemy climbing up one by one from the edge of the outer moat. At the command, grenades flew towards the enemy. Secretary Xiang Jin shouted, "Good, keep hitting in that direction!" One grenade after another, the smoke filled the entire position. But the enemy was closing in. Zhao Runming was wounded, and Qiao Huide was also wounded. The enemy was shouting "kill" in front of the fortifications. Platoon Leader Wang Qilu and the branch secretary rushed forward a few steps, throwing grenades one after another, driving back the enemy. Then, our side organized a counterattack. Wang Anguo took a soldier's rifle and led three or four soldiers to charge forward. A phosphorus incendiary bomb hit Liu Er ×'s clothes. He rolled on the spot and went up again. A grenade hit Guo Zhihe's feet. Guo Zhihe immediately picked it up and sent it back to the enemy. In the rear, young devils Yan Bingwang, Tong Xiangquan, and others used volley fire to strike the enemy, shooting them one by one. New soldiers Yuan Jianguo and Ren Xiaomian used volley fire to block the enemy's movement. Yuan Jianguo raised his hand and shot one enemy, and the second shot hit another. An fierce battle lasted for nearly two hours. The enemy retreated and dared not come out again.

　　In this battle, the First Battalion of the Ninetieth Regiment of the enemy's Thirtieth Brigade was taken care of by us. Only twenty or so men were left in the First and Second Companies, and only thirty or forty men were left in the Third Company. The enemy battalion commander was killed in vain during the counterattack. Almost the entire First Company was buried alive in the cave dwellings when we used tunnel explosions.

　　血战一○三阵地
  　攻克临汾战斗通讯
    临汾东门外敌人的一○三号阵地，打下来就可控制外壕和登城。但这是敌比较坚强的工事。人们千百双眼睛和千百颗心，都在注视着和关心着这重要阵地的攻击。
    康团长亲自到五连进行动员，大家给团里写了保证书，给友邻部队挑了战，保证“攻上去，守得住”。决定七、九两班是突击班。七班副刚从医院回来，便要求参加爆破组，提出保证完成爆破任务。一班战士杨法禄说：“班长，剩下一个人也要完成任务呀！”一班长郎心会听了，实在高兴，立即召集全班开会，动员大家：“咱班剩下一个人也要完成任务。”七班长葛玉增、九班长耿利荣召集全班在地上画地图，研究遇到敌人“一”字交通壕怎办、“丁”字交通壕、“人”字交通壕又怎办。三班忙着挖暗道，一黑夜就挖了十来公尺。地形大家看了一次又一次，有的贪婪地看了六、七次。
    手榴弹每人带了二十个，还有炸药包，用绳子把它都拴起披在身上。郎心会一个人便背了二十五个，因没绳子没炸弹袋，就解下自己的里腿来拴。
    坑道、暗道都已构成了，火力都摆好了，旅、团首长还不放心，鼓励大家说：“就看你们五连这一下子呀！”
    是四号七点钟，太阳将落，我们的炮火在一○三号阵地上开了花了，突击队在这时挖开出击暗道的口子。炸药轰的一声，把大地震动了，七、九班从两个暗道口扑了过去，九班的动作稍一迟缓，七班长葛玉增说时迟那时快，带着全班立即越过九班头里，攀上了阵地，猛向右冀交通壕扑去。前面是敌人护地碉，段玉明第一个上去即牺牲了，全班都负伤了，责任心鼓动着班长葛玉增，他虽然也负了伤，但他打出了几个手榴弹后，继续前进。遇到了副班长刘银章，两人又扑上去。班长二次负伤了，只剩下刘银章一人了，——老战斗模范刘银章，住了医院九个月，前天他才回来——他心想：“前面地碉内有敌一挺轻机枪，后面是敌人一挺重机枪，如不把它消灭，战机就要失了，阵地也会丢掉，后面上来要多死人，我要坚持下去。”他猛的扑向地碉，塞进两颗手榴弹，再加上炸药包，护地碉垮了，但敌人也早吓跑了。刘银章扑到前面地坎边，坚持到三班上来了他才喘了口气，又参加了三班作战。友邻部队没上来，他们又迅速往北发展，迎接友邻。一班长郎心会站在两班最前头，带领全班向左翼交通壕猛扑过去，他们象一阵旋风一样，越过了突击第九班，迅速到了城壕边。任务完成了，敌人被消灭了。一班打的很硬，全班剩下杨法禄一人也还在战斗。一、三排都上来了，于是继续扩大胜利，巩固阵地。
    一○三号阵地占领了，友邻区我们也控制了。
    明天白天要守呀，工专需要改造啦！紧张的气氛围绕着阵地，手忙脚乱，门板在跳动，麻袋在横飞，你来我去，锹在怒吼，镐在嘶叫，时间象宝贝一样，大家知道一分钟的松懈，将要造成多大的恶果呀！心情紧张的喘不过气来，“快，快，快，快来呀，门板、麻袋！”人们低声的嚷着，紧张的挥锹镐。可是这阵地已经稀烂了，被我们的炸药和炮弹摧毁得不象个样子了，要想构成一个好工事是不容易的。但在几个钟头过去后，天明了，这一废墟上筑起我们的工事来了。虽然还不够令人满意，但确乎是战士们的血汗和毅力的结晶。
    早上八点钟，敌人的反扑来了，炮弹、机枪乱打一阵之后，接着手榴弹、黄燃弹打在我们的阵地上。
    二班副赵润明看到敌人从外壕边一个个爬上来了，一声口令，手榴弹纷纷向敌人飞过去。支书香金喊叫：“好啦，再打就这方向！”手榴弹一个接着一个，烟雾漫没了整个阵地。但敌人逼近了，赵润明负了伤了，乔会德也负了伤了，敌人在工事前干叫喊“杀”，排长王七禄和支部书记扑上去几步，手榴弹接连直向前面扔去，打退了敌人。接着我方组织反冲锋，王安国拿了战士一支步枪，带了三四个战士冲上去了，一个黄燃弹打着了刘二×的衣服，他就地一滚，又上去了，一颗手榴弹打在郭志和的跟前，郭志和立即把它拿起又送还给敌人。后面小鬼阎秉旺、童向泉等以排子枪打击敌人，见一个打一个，新战士袁建国与任小面，以排子枪封锁住敌人的运动。袁建国举手一枪打着了一个敌人，第二枪又打着一个，一场恶战足有两个来钟头，敌人缩头了，静悄悄的再也不敢出来了。
    这一战，敌三十旅九十团第一营被我们收拾了，第一连、第二连只剩下二十余人，第三连也只剩下三四十人了。敌营长是在反扑时白白的送命了。第一连几乎全部在我们坑道爆破时活埋在窑洞里了。
