【Ji-Lu-Yu News】In the production and disaster relief work of the Third District of Hua County, the biggest deviation has been neglecting the old village cadres, believing they are all bad, and adopting an attitude of exclusion and hostility. The district cadres went deep into the lower levels to find poor peasants and hired laborers to understand the situation, causing the village cadres to be suspicious and afraid, not doing their work, waiting to be rectified, and complaining behind their backs. This has caused great losses to the work. To correct this deviation, a meeting of all village cadres in the district was held on the 15th and 16th of this month to dispel the cadres' concerns, point out the direction, improve enthusiasm, and deploy production and disaster relief and correction work. At the meeting, the leadership explained that the meaning of party rectification is to treat illnesses and save people. If there are mistakes, they must be reflected upon and corrected, so that everyone can get rid of their problems and become good cadres, not to strike at them. Afterwards, everyone was free to form groups for deliberation. At the beginning, village cadres with less serious problems were afraid of乱打干部 (indiscriminately attacking cadres) when implementing democracy; village cadres with serious mistakes did not reflect on themselves, but pushed the mistakes upwards and to the masses. Only cadres with no or few mistakes said: "What are you afraid of if the masses raise opinions? If you don't have problems you won't die." Later, the leadership made further enlightenment, pointing out that the leadership should be responsible for certain problems, but the main thing is to reflect on oneself. After another night of deliberation and discussion, the cadres' thinking began to turn around. Li Donglai, a village cadre from Guozhuang Village, said: "In the past, I didn't know what to do. If this meeting hadn't been held, I would still be in the dark. This meeting can be considered to have found the way." Wang Yinju, the instructor of Bei Yangliu, after reflecting on five mistakes including corruption, said: "I'll do whatever I'm told when I go back." Wu Jinju from Zhuangying said: "I'll admit my mistakes to the masses when I go back, and we'll see, I'll have to work hard." Others said: "I'll reflect wherever I'm told to reflect, even at the general meeting." They also thought of some ways to get the masses to raise opinions. If the masses dare not raise them, first raise them in small group meetings, and then hold a general meeting, etc. After such discussion and deliberation, the village cadres all expressed that they would take the initiative to think of ways to eliminate wasteland after returning to the village, and their enthusiasm was improved. Branch Opinion: According to a letter from Comrade Lin Yuan of the County Committee, the main purpose of this village cadre meeting in the Third District of Hua County, according to the intention of the County Committee, is to make the old village cadres recognize the current situation, face up to some of their own problems, and clarify that they will serve the people in the future. In short, it is to make the old village cadres stand up. From this, it can be seen that this may be the spirit of the work of the whole county. However, there is too little material to be sure. Here are two points for joint study: (1) The leadership did not focus on reviewing its own mistakes, but wanted the village cadres to mainly reflect on themselves. Therefore, it still carries the meaning of rectifying the village cadres, and cannot better combine with the village cadres' thoughts and emotions to reflect together, so that they feel that it is really treating illnesses and saving people, resulting in resistance. We still doubt whether the cadres' thinking was cleared at the end of the meeting. (2) Without strong leadership at this meeting and in the short period of time after the meeting, the past mistakes of the village cadres cannot be cleared. Therefore, there is no need to overemphasize that the village cadres immediately reflect on their mistakes, or even, as mentioned in the draft, "hold a meeting after returning to the village and ask the masses for their opinions." After they are raised, the problems cannot be solved immediately, which will increase the ideological burden of the village cadres and affect the current work. At present, we should specifically study how to correct deviations and production issues, call on the village cadres to do things well for the people, make up for their mistakes, and gain the trust of the masses. Only by raising issues from a positive perspective can the village cadres stand up. However, this meeting did not conduct a good study of specific work issues in the future, but only vaguely said that they would think of ways to eliminate wasteland and serve the people in the future. This may create an atmosphere of rectifying village cadres in the village after the meeting, making the village cadres feel at a loss, so that the correction and production cannot be quickly implemented. It is hoped that the county and district leadership will investigate and study to prevent the continuation of mistakes, and hope to report.

### 滑县三区开始扭转村干情绪　空谈灭荒办法不具体

　　滑县三区开始扭转村干情绪
  　空谈灭荒办法不具体
    【冀鲁豫消息】滑县三区在这段生产救灾工作中，最大的偏向是对老村干不管不问，认为他们都不好，采取排斥仇视态度。光区干深入下层找贫雇，了解情况，造成村干部怀疑害怕，不做工作，等着挨整，背地发牢骚。这使工作受了很大损失。为纠正这个偏向，本月十五、十六两日召开全区村干会，解除村干顾虑，指出方向，提高积极性，布置生产救灾及纠偏工作。会议中，领导上说明整党的意思是治病救人。有错误必须反省纠正，为的是使大家去掉毛病，成个好干部，不是打击。以后由大家自由结组酝酿。开始时，毛病不太严重的村干，怕在实行民主时乱打干部；错误严重的村干不反省自己，将错误向上推，向群众推。只有没错误的或错误很少的干部才说：“叫群众提意见怕啥？肚子里没病死不了人。”后来领导上又做了启发，指出某些毛病领导上要负责，但主要应反省自己。又经过一晚上酝酿讨论，干部思想开始转过来。郭庄村干李东来说：“过去也不知道怎着好啦，要不开这个会，还是在闷葫芦里。这会可算摸着路啦。”北杨柳的指导员王银聚反省出来贪污等五条错误后说：“回去叫怎干就怎干。”庄营的吴金聚说：“回去向群众承认错误，以后看吧，要得挂劲干哩。”还有的说：“叫在那里反省就在那里反省，大会上也行。”还想了些叫群众提意见的办法。要是群众不敢提，先开小组会提出来，再开大会等。经过这样讨论酝酿，村干都表示回村后要主动想法消灭荒地，积极性提高了。分社意见：据县委会林远同志来信说：滑县三区这个村干会议，按县委会的目的，主要是要老村干认识现在的形势，正视自己的一些毛病，明确今后为人民服务。简单说，就是老村干站起来。由此可见，这可能是全县工作的精神。但材料太少，还不能肯定。这里提出两点意见，共同研究：（一）领导上没有着重检讨自己的错误，而要村干主要是反省自己。因此还是带着整村干的意味，而不能更好的和村干思想情绪结合起来，一同反省，使之感到真正是治病救人，以致发生抵抗情绪。会议结束时是否村干思想通了，我们还有怀疑。（二）在这个会议上和开会以后的短时间内，如没有坚强的领导，村干过去的错误是不能得到清算的。因此，现在也不必过于强调村干立刻反省错误，甚至如稿内所称“回村后开会，要群众提意见”。等提出来之后，问题又不能马上解决，会增加村干的思想负担，反而影响当前工作。目前应当具体研究如何纠偏与生产等问题，号召村干好好为人民做事情，补救自己的错误，取得群众的信任。只有从积极方面提出问题，村干才会站起来。而在这个会上，并没有很好的研究今后具体工作问题，只是空洞的说今后要想法消灭荒地，为人民服务。这样会后可能在村内产生整村干的空气，使村干感到工作束手无策，以致纠偏生产不能迅速贯彻。希县区领导上调查研究，防止错误继续发生，并望做报导。
