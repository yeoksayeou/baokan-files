　　"Selected Rural Great Leap Forward Ballads"
    In the sound of the Great Leap Forward horn, rural ballads have also reaped a bumper harvest. The three hundred and more excellent works selected in this book are part of this ballad abundance. These ballads sing the praises of the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, the wisdom, strength, and revolutionary drive of the millions of agricultural laborers, and the vivid deeds in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, elimination of the four pests, and learning culture. They also sing the praises of cadres going to lower levels and the transformation of cadre work styles. From these ballads, we can not only see the magnificent spirit of the Great Leap Forward in rural production, but also hear the heroic aspirations of the Great Leap Forward in rural thought. This book is edited by the Folk Literature Research Association and published by the Writers Publishing House. (Ren Wen)

    Tian Han's New Work "Guan Hanqing"
    The May issue of "Drama Script" magazine published Tian Han's new work "Guan Hanqing." This play was written by Comrade Tian Han to commemorate Guan Hanqing, one of the world's cultural celebrities and China's great playwright. Focusing on Guan Hanqing's creation of "The Injustice to Dou E," the author enthusiastically praises Guan Hanqing's high humanitarian spirit.
    In this play, we can see how Guan Hanqing created the masterpiece "The Injustice to Dou E"; we can also see the noble character of Guan Hanqing and the famous contemporary actor Zhu Lianxiu, who risked their lives to create and perform this great tragedy, and to seek justice for the wronged woman. This script has clear ideas, deep emotions, and a fresh style, fully expressing the playwright's revolutionary romanticism. (Liu Jiang)

    "Literary Miscellany"
    "Literary Miscellany" (published by Beijing Publishing House) is a collection of literary criticism and political essays written by Comrade Liu Baiyu from 1955 to 1957. This book comments on and analyzes some of the problems existing in the literary and art circles and literary creation in recent years, and conducts sharp and profound counterattacks and criticisms against bourgeois rightists and some incorrect literary and artistic viewpoints.

    "Song of the Greater Liang Mountains"
    Gao Ying's collection of poems "Song of the Greater Liang Mountains" focuses on depicting the vastly different lives of the Yi people in the Greater Liang Mountains before and after liberation.

    "Romance of the West Chamber"
    The comic strip "Romance of the West Chamber" published by Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House is adapted from Wang Shifu's zaju drama and illustrated by female painter Wang Shuhui.
    This is a relatively good comic strip. The composition is relatively rigorous and elegant, and the line drawing method consistently used by the author is also very coordinated with the content of the work. In particular, the author's diligent pursuit of creating character images and portraying character personalities further increases the touching power of this comic strip. (Ji)

    田汉新作“关汉卿”
    “剧本”月刊5月号登载了田汉的新作“关汉卿”。这出戏是田汉同志为纪念世界文化名人之一、我国大戏剧家关汉卿而写的。作者以关汉卿创作“窦娥冤”为中心，热情洋溢地歌颂了关汉卿高度的人道主义精神。
    在这出戏里，我们可以看到关汉卿是怎样创作“窦娥冤”这部杰作的；也看到了关汉卿和当代名优朱廉秀为了创作和演出这一部伟大的悲剧，为衔冤的女子申冤，而将自己生命置之度外的高尚人格。这个剧本思想鲜明、感情深厚、风格清新，充分地表露了剧作家的革命浪漫主义精神。　（柳江）

    “西厢记”
    北京人民美术出版社出的连环画“西厢记”，是根据王实甫的杂剧改编的，由女画家王叔晖绘图。
