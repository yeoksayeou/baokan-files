Xinhua News Agency, 14th: In order to welcome the arrival of the high tide of technological revolution and cultural revolution, the China Association for Science and Technology held a leap forward conference for all staff on the 14th. The conference called on everyone to realize a great liberation of communist thought under the beacon of the general line of building socialism, to think boldly, delve boldly, and create courageously, and to contribute all their strength to the technological revolution.

"Everyone contributes ideas and gifts, everyone is full of energy and strives for the top," was the determination expressed by all attendees. Gao Shiqi, a member of the National Committee of the National Science Popularization Association, said to everyone: "I am a paralyzed patient. But I want to assure you that in the technological revolution movement, I will creatively study and creatively work, and dedicate my entire life to the socialist popular science cause." The staff of the Science Popularization Publishing House all expressed their intention to promote the technological revolution by launching a great leap forward in publishing work. In addition to running the existing periodicals such as "Science Masses," "Knowledge is Power," and "Learn Science" this year, they will also publish more than a dozen science and technology series in coordination with the technological revolution, such as "Compilation of Four-Five-Eight Grain Increase Experience," "Outline Series on Agricultural Development," "Mass Science Series," "Learning from Hong'an's Agricultural Increase Experience," "Rural Science Series," and "Compilation of Pig Raising and Animal Husbandry Experience." All the staff of the "Science Popularization Work" editorial office also expressed their determination to work hard for a month to compile a "Science Popularization Work Handbook" as a gift for the "July 1st" Party's birthday.

The conference was full of a leap forward atmosphere. At the meeting, the staff of various departments, divisions, and offices of the Science Popularization Association, the Beijing Planetarium, and the Science Popularization Publishing House competed to speak. The industrial and mining, rural, comprehensive, and research groups of the General Assembly's Organization Department proposed to summarize fifteen sets of advanced experiences in carrying out popular science and technology work in industrial and mining areas, rural areas, troops, and ethnic minority areas before the end of October this year. All the staff of the Science Department of the General Assembly's Propaganda Department also unanimously expressed, "Work hard for two years to change the face, be full of energy, compile textbooks to eliminate scientific illiteracy, and present gifts for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country." The creative spirit of all the employees of the Image Data Office attracted the attention of the conference. They proposed to the conference, "Successfully trial-produce a medium-sized planetarium next year, and successfully trial-produce a large-sized planetarium within five years." The Beijing Planetarium, which used to be closed on Mondays, also told the conference that from now on, it would be open as usual on Mondays to meet the needs of the audience.

　　把生命献给科普事业
    全国科普开全体工作人员跃进大会
    新华社14日讯　为了迎接技术革命和文化革命高潮的到来，中华全国科学技术普及协会在14日举行了全体工作人员跃进大会。大会号召大家，在建设社会主义总路线的灯塔照耀下，实现共产主义思想大解放，大胆地想，大胆地钻，勇敢地创造，为技术革命贡献出全部力量。
    “人人献计，献礼，人人鼓足干劲、力争上游”，这是所有到会人表示的决心。全国科普协会全国委员会委员高士其向大家表示说：“我是一个瘫痪的病人。但我要向你们保证，在技术革命运动中，创造性地学习，创造性地工作，把整个生命献给社会主义科普事业。”科普出版社的工作人员个个表示以掀起出版工作的大跃进来促进技术革命，他们在今年除办好现有的“科学大众”、“知识就是力量”、“学科学”等期刊外，配合技术革命，还要出版“四五八粮食增产经验汇编”、“农业发展纲要丛书”、“大众科学丛书”、“学习红安农业增产经验”、“农村科学丛书”、“养猪和畜牧经验汇编”等十余种科学技术丛书。“科学普及工作”编辑室的全体人员也表示，苦干一个月编出“科普工作手册”给“七一”党的生日献礼。
    大会充满了跃进气氛。在会上，科普总会、北京天文馆和科普出版社的各部、处、室的工作人员纷纷争着发言。总会组织部的工矿、农村、综合和研究等组提出，今年10月底前总结出在工矿、农村、部队、少数民族地区开展科学技术普及工作的十五套先进经验。总会宣传部科学室全体人员也一致表示“苦战两年，改变面貌，鼓足干劲，编出扫科学盲课本，给开国十周年纪念日献礼。”形象资料室全体职工的创造精神引起了大会的注意。他们向大会提出“明年试制成功中型天象仪，五年内试制成功一架大型天象仪”。过去星期一休息的北京天文馆也向大会表示了从今以后，星期一照常开放，以满足观众需要。
