Vast Primitive Fruit Forests Contain Endless Potential
    Development Team Dispatched by Xinjiang Enters Forest Area

    (Our Dispatch) A large area of primitive apple forest hidden in the Tianshan Mountains is about to be developed. A development team of more than 100 people dispatched by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has entered the forest area from Gongliu County in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, preparing to transform this wild apple forest into a new fruit base for the autonomous region.

    The primitive fruit forest within Gongliu County, which is currently under development, is approximately 140 kilometers long and 9 kilometers wide. The forest area contains more than ten kinds of fruit trees, such as wild apples, crabapples, cherries, and mountain apricots, totaling about 3 million trees. It is estimated that wild apples can produce at least 3 billion catties per year, while walnuts, bitter almonds, etc., can produce about 10 million catties.

    According to a survey conducted by the autonomous region's agricultural department in 1956, more than 160,000 mu of primitive fruit forests are distributed along the banks of the Ili River and Gongnais River, most of which are mature fruit trees. Many of them are varieties with large fruits, sweet taste, and excellent quality.

    Currently, the personnel developing the primitive fruit forest are establishing an advanced base near the forest area, preparing to transform the fruit trees through methods such as grafting and thinning. They will also establish fruit processing factories to start producing some fresh fruit, dried fruit, jam, and fruit wine this year. (Tan Feng)

    大片原始果林蕴藏无尽
    新疆派出的开发大队已进入林区
    本报讯　隐没在天山丛林中的大面积原始苹果林即将开发。新疆维吾尔自治区派出的一个由一百多人组成的开发大队，已从伊犁哈萨克族自治州的巩留县进入林区，准备把这片野苹果林改造为自治区新的水果基地。
    正在进行开发的巩留县境内原始果林面积长约一百四十公里，宽九公里。林区里生长着野苹果、海棠、樱桃和山杏等十几种果树，约三百多万株。据估计，野苹果每年最少可产三十亿斤，核桃、苦杏仁等可产一千万斤左右。
    根据1956年自治区农业部门的调查，在伊犁河和巩乃斯河等河流两岸分布着十六万多亩原始果林，并且大部是壮年果树，其中有很多是果实硕大、味甜质佳的品种。
    现在，开发原始果林的人员正在靠近林区的地方建立起前进基地，准备用改种、稀伐等办法改造果木，并建立起水果加工厂，今年开始生产一部分鲜果、果干、果酱和果子酒等。　（谈风）
