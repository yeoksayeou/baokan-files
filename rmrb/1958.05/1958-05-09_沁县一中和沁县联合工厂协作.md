    Collaboration Between Qin County No. 1 Middle School and Qin County United Factory
    (By Our Correspondent) Shanxi Province, Qin County No. 1 Middle School, in order to implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, and combining work and study, and to support local industry, has implemented large-scale factory-school collaboration with the Qin County United Factory. More than 100 students have already participated in production.
    After the students participated in productive labor, their book knowledge was put into practice, promoting their enthusiasm for learning. Zhang Xiaohu, who is studying electrical engineering, can already use the knowledge of current, voltage, and resistance learned in physics class to observe and measure the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter of the generator. The eight students who participated in the learning in the sand casting workshop generally understand the basic knowledge of sand casting and have learned techniques such as mixing materials and modeling. Fan Shuping and others who are studying fitter work have been able to turn out screws that meet the standards. Everyone has learned production skills, and their enthusiasm for learning is growing, which promotes teaching and improves teaching quality. The teachers and the factory have also signed a "mutual teaching and mutual learning" agreement. Teachers teach workers, and workers teach teachers technology, which not only overcomes the dogmatism of teaching that is divorced from reality, but also solves the problem of some technicians lacking scientific knowledge and culture, and promotes the ideological remoulding of teachers.

    沁县一中和沁县联合工厂协作
    本报讯　山西省沁县第一中学，为贯彻勤俭办学、勤工俭学的方针，并支援地方工业，已与沁县联合工厂实行厂校大协作，已有一百多名学生参加了生产。
    学生们参加生产劳动后，书本知识得到实践，促进了他们的学习热情。学习电工的张小虎，已经能用物理课中学到的电流、电压、电阻等知识，来观察、测量发电机的安培、伏特、欧姆计。参加翻砂车间学习的八个学生，一般都懂得了翻砂的基本知识，学会了配料、造模等技术。学习钳工的樊树屏等已经能够旋出合乎标准的螺丝。大家学到了生产本领，学习劲头越来越大，推动教学，提高了教学质量。教师们和工厂也订立了“互教互学”协议书，教师给工人上课，工人教教师技术，既克服了教学脱离实际的教条主义现象，又解决了部分技工缺乏科学知识和文化的问题，并且促进了教师们的思想改造。
