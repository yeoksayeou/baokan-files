Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Warsaw, TASS, May 24th: Because the Laotian government requested the abolition of the International Supervision and Control Commission (composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada) stationed in Laos after supplementary elections, the commission had sent a letter to the chair of the Geneva Conference regarding this matter.

The Soviet government (whose representative is one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference) in a note to the government of the Polish People's Republic, as well as the governments of India and Canada, advocated for retaining the commission.

In its reply to the Laotian government, the government of the Polish People's Republic fully agreed with the Soviet government's position and believed that the supplementary elections did not thoroughly resolve all of Laos's political problems, nor were all the tasks assigned to the commission by the Geneva Accords completed. Moreover, the situation in Laos cannot be viewed separately from the situations in other Indochinese countries. As everyone knows, the situation in Vietnam remains very complex. Ceasing the work of the Laotian commission could exacerbate the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The government of the Polish People's Republic believes that, under the current circumstances, the Laotian commission can, according to the principles of Article 39 of the agreements, begin to reduce its activities so that the commission can operate in the future like the Cambodian commission.

    日内瓦会议主席国苏联照会波印加
    主张保留老挝国际委员会
    波兰复信老挝政府同意苏联态度
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社华沙24日讯：由于老挝政府要求在补选以后，撤销驻在老挝的国际监督和监察委员会（它由印度、波兰和加拿大代表组成），委员会曾经就这件事致函日内瓦会议主席。
    苏联政府（它的代表是日内瓦会议的主席之一）在给波兰人民共和国政府以及印度和加拿大政府的照会中，主张保留这个委员会。
    波兰人民共和国政府在给老挝政府的复信中完全同意苏联政府的态度，并且认为，补充选举并没有使的老挝所有政治问题得到彻底的解决，日内瓦协定交给这个委员会的任务也没有全部完成。何况不能把老挝局势同印度支那其他国家的局势分开来看。大家都知道，越南局势至今仍然是很复杂的。停止老挝委员会的工作，可能使印度支那和东南亚的局势尖锐化。
    波兰人民共和国政府认为，在目前情况下，老挝委员会可以根据协定的第三十九条的原则着手减少它的活动，使这个委员会今后可以像柬埔寨委员会那样进行工作。
