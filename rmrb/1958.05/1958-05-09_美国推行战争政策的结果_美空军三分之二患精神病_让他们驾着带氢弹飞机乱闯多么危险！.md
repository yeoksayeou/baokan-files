Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th – Two-thirds of the personnel in the U.S. Air Force suffer from mental and nervous disorders of varying degrees, and many of them are still flying planes carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs both in the U.S. and abroad.

The "Neues Deutschland" published on the 7th the full text of a secret letter written by Frank Berry, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health and Medicine in the U.S., to Defense Secretary McElroy on March 27th. This secret letter described the situation mentioned above.

Berry said in the letter that according to a health check conducted on all U.S. Air Force officers and personnel stationed in domestic and foreign regions, “67.3% of all on-board personnel examined suffer from mental and nervous disorders,” and that “the situation is particularly bad for officers and air force personnel serving abroad and those in the Strategic Air Command at home.”

Berry said, "Generally speaking, the most shocking thing is neurasthenia. In most cases, it manifests as: excessive sensitivity; the inability of subjective will to fully control actions; various phobias, especially the fear of flying; as well as hysterical syndrome and inexplicable outbursts of hatred."

Berry pointed out that in the past six months, a series of accidents have occurred involving U.S. Air Force personnel, such as a plane firing on civilians in Wisconsin. "These incidents occurred less because of technical failures than because of mental defects in the on-board personnel."

Berry said, "Studies of cases involving pilots and navigators in the Strategic Air Command have shown that the main factors contributing to this situation are: overwork, especially due to intercontinental flights; prolonged excessive drinking; the use of narcotic cigarettes; excessive indulgence and perverted sexuality; and extreme fatigue due to continuous card playing. And the typical situation for all on-board personnel engaged in flights with atomic and hydrogen bombs is mental depression."

Berry said that he had consulted with some representatives of the Air Force on ways to improve the physical condition of pilots and navigators. These representatives insisted on a complete replacement of flight personnel. Berry said, however, that this "is practically impossible" because "Air Force Command is worried that this would result in the number of U.S. Air Force personnel being far below the minimum number of officers and airmen required."

    美国推行战争政策的结果
    美空军三分之二患精神病
    让他们驾着带氢弹飞机乱闯多么危险！
    新华社柏林8日电　美国空军人员三分之二患有不同程度的精神性神经病，其中许多人还在驾驶着载有原子弹和氢弹的飞机在美国国内外飞行。
    “新德意志报”7日刊登了美国负责医药卫生的助理国防部长弗兰克·伯里3月27日写给国防部长麦克耳罗伊的一封秘密信的全文，这封秘密信叙述了上述情况。
    伯里在信中说，根据对驻扎在国内外地区的全体美国空军军官和空军人员所进行的健康检查，“在受检查的全体机上人员中，有67.3％患有精神性神经病”，其中“服役国外的军官和空军人员以及在国内战略空军司令部中的人员情况特别不好”。
    伯里说，“一般说来最令人触目惊心的是精神衰弱症。在大多数情况下表现为：过度敏感；主观意志不能充分控制行动；各种各样的恐惧病，特别是飞行恐惧病；以及歇斯底里的综合病征和莫名其妙的憎恨情绪的发作。”
    伯里指出，在过去六个月中，美国空军人员曾发生一系列事故，例如飞机在威斯康星州向平民开枪。“这些事件之所以发生，与其说是由于技术故障，还不如说是由于机上人员的精神缺陷。”
    伯里说，“对战略空军司令部飞机驾驶员和领航员的病例的研究表明，促成这种情况的主要因素是：劳累过度，特别是由于进行洲际飞行而劳累过度；长期饮酒过度；服用麻醉品的香烟；纵欲过度和变态性欲；由于连续打纸牌而极度疲劳。而所有从事带有原子弹和氢弹的飞行的机上人员的典型情况是精神上的消沉。”
    伯里说，他曾经和空军的一些代表就改善驾驶员和领航员的体格状况的办法进行过商量。这些代表坚持对飞行人员进行彻底更换。伯里说，然而这“实际上是办不到的”，因为“空军司令部担心这样一来美国空军人员的数目会远远低于所需要的军官和空军人员的最低数目”。
