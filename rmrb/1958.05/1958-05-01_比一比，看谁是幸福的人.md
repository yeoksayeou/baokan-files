Let's Compare and See Who Is Happier

We will list some facts regarding employment, wages, and housing to compare the lives of working people in the two worlds. We can then see which system is superior and who is happier. In the face of these facts, the defenders of the capitalist system are in a truly pathetic situation!

The Life of Workers in Thriving Socialist Countries

Employment

The Soviet Union completely eliminated unemployment during its first pre-war Five-Year Plan. Currently, the total number of employees and workers in the Soviet Union has increased from 12.9 million in 1913 to 52.6 million, more than a threefold increase. The proportion of employees, workers and their families in the total population has increased from 17% in 1913 to 59.5%, totaling 117 million people.

The Chinese working class is also growing stronger with the development of socialist industry. In 1948, there were only 2.4 million employees and workers nationwide, but by 1957, this number had increased to 23,973,000.

With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the number of employed people in Poland has increased by 4,858,000 in the eleven years since the war, more than a twofold increase.

Czechoslovakia, with a population of 13 million, has more than 4.5 million employees and workers, an increase of one-quarter compared to before the war.

Wages

In 1957, the Soviet Union took measures to announce the reduction of prices for various foods and daily necessities, increased the wages of low-wage employees and workers, and implemented a seven-hour workday. Workers in some industries (such as coal mines) have switched to a six-hour workday. In that year, Soviet residents purchased 75.7 billion rubles more worth of goods than in 1956.

In 1957, the total wages of employees and workers in China was 15.25 billion yuan, more than double that of 1952; during the same period, the wage level increased by 42.7%.

In 1957, the average monthly wage in Poland's socialist industrial sector increased by nearly 20% compared to 1956, Romania increased by nearly 10%, and Hungary increased by about 16%. Due to the improvement of people's living standards, the retail trade volume in various countries has generally increased. In Poland, the retail trade volume in 1957 increased by 14%, Czechoslovakia and East Germany both increased by more than 6%, and Hungary and Bulgaria increased by 9% respectively.

Housing

In 1957, the Soviet Union built 1.53 million housing units with state funds and self-funded public assistance, 28% more than in 1956. Calculated per capita, the Soviet Union's housing construction has greatly exceeded the level of capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France.

In the eight years since China's liberation, the total construction area of residential buildings has reached 90 million square meters. Five million employees and workers, along with their families, totaling 17 million people, have moved into new homes.

In 1957, Poland built a total of 346,000 rooms, 83,000 more than in 1956.

To date, Romania has newly built more than 2.5 million square meters of residential space in cities since liberation, and one-third of the residents in Bulgaria live in newly built homes since liberation.

The Life of Workers in Capitalist Countries Under Economic Crisis

Now, let's take a look at the lives of workers in capitalist countries under economic crisis.

Unemployment

With the further aggravation of the economic crisis in the United States, the wave of unemployment has swept through major cities in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 30 of the 48 states, the number of unemployed has exceeded 6% of the total number of workers; the number of unemployed nationwide has increased from 3.2 million at the beginning of 1957 to 5.25 million in February 1958, reaching the highest number of unemployed in sixteen years. The workers who have been laid off the most by monopoly capital are in industries such as steel, machinery, aircraft, automobiles, and durable consumer goods.

The number of unemployed in Britain is also increasing. According to figures released by the British Ministry of Labour, as of March 17, 1958, the number of unemployed in Britain had increased by another 9,000 compared to February, reaching 433,000, creating the highest record of unemployment in Britain since January 1953. In addition, there were 103,000 underemployed people in March, an increase of 21,000 compared to February.

In West Germany, according to materials from the West German Federal Labor Exchange and Unemployment Insurance Bureau, the total number of unemployed at the end of January this year was 1,432,000.

Italy currently also has an army of 2 million unemployed and 12 million impoverished people.

The so-called "Jimmu Boom" boasted by Japanese monopoly capital groups has passed, and the problem of unemployment is becoming increasingly serious. According to official estimates by the Economic Planning Agency, there are 530,000 fully unemployed people this year, and millions of semi-unemployed workers.

Poverty

The increasing number of unemployed workers in capitalist countries also faces the threat of rising consumer goods prices and declining real wages.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in February 1958, the U.S. cost of living index was 122.5 (the average for 1947 to 1949 was 100), an increase of 3.2% compared to a year ago, while workers' real wages fell by 5% during the same period. Currently, U.S. monopoly capital is making every effort to prevent prices from falling in order to shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the working people.

Retail prices in Britain rose by an average of 4.5% in 1957 and are still rising at the beginning of this year. In France, in January this year, the prices of eleven kinds of food rose sharply. Compared with the same period last year, meat rose by 12%-14%, eggs by 46%, potatoes by 28%, and some fruits by 80%-90%. The cost of living index in West Germany in January this year also increased by 4.2% compared to the same period last year. Although the wage indices of workers in these countries have caught up with the retail price indices, the increase in real wages is too small compared to the growth of labor productivity. For example, in January this year, the wage index in Britain was 112 and the retail price index was 108.1 (both taking 1956 as 100), but labor productivity increased by 20% from 1956 to 1957.

Housing Shortage

The deterioration of the living conditions of working people in capitalist countries stands in stark contrast to the luxurious houses and villas inhabited by millionaires.

According to the U.S. "Nation" magazine, one-third of the people in the United States currently live in crowded and dilapidated houses and slums. "Fortune" magazine estimates that more than 17 million people live in slums. In New York alone, 1.5 million people live in slums, and there are 250,000 homes that are "substandard."

The housing shortage in France is extremely serious. At least 1.8 million families in France currently have six people crowded into a small room. In Paris alone, 400,000 people live a life of "rotational accommodation" in hotels. It has become commonplace for railway workers without families to live in carriages. Due to the lack of housing, 2.5 million people in France live single lives, and 29% of young couples do not have their own homes.

In Italy, in Rome alone, more than 55,000 people live in caves, dilapidated wooden sheds, and abandoned football fields; but on the other hand, advertisements are posted everywhere for more than 5,000 houses waiting to be rented or sold. It is estimated that in the suburbs of Rome, renting a medium-sized residence with two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom costs at least 30,000 lira per month, while workers or ordinary clerks only earn an average of 45,000 to 65,000 lira.

### 比一比，看谁是幸福的人

专栏：数字与事实

    比一比，看谁是幸福的人
    我们仅从就业、工资和住宅方面列举一些事实，来比一比两个世界的劳动人民生活的情况，就可以看到那一个制度优越，谁是幸福的人。在这些事实面前，资本主义制度的辩护人落到了多么可悲的境地！
    繁荣发展中的社会主义国家工人生活
    就业
    苏联在战前的第一个五年计划里就完全消灭了失业现象。目前苏联全国职工总数已由1913年的一千二百九十万人增加到五千二百六十万人，即增加了三倍多。职工和他们家属在全国人口中所占的比例已从1913年的17％增加到59.5％，共达一亿一千七百万人。
    中国工人阶级在社会主义工业的发展中也日益壮大。1948年全国职工还只有二百四十万人，1957年增加到了二千三百九十七万三千人。
    随着工农业的迅速发展，波兰在战后的十一年中从业人数增加了四百八十五万八千人，即增加了两倍多。
    拥有一千三百万人口的捷克斯洛伐克的全国职工人数已达四百五十多万人，比战前增加了四分之一。
    工资
    在1957年里，苏联先后采取措施宣布降低各种食品和日用品的价格，增加了低工资职工的工资，同时还实行了七小时工作制。某些行业（如煤矿）的工人已改为六小时工作日。在这一年里，苏联全国居民比1956年多购买了价值七百五十七亿卢布的货物。
    中国职工工资总数在1957年是一百五十二亿五千万元，比1952年增加了一倍以上；同期内，工资水平增加了42.7％。
    1957年波兰社会主义工业部门的每月平均工资比1956年增加将近20％，罗马尼亚增加将近10％，匈牙利约增加16％。由于人民生活水平的提高，各国的零售贸易额都普遍有所增长。在波兰，1957年的零售贸易额增长达14％，捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国都增加了6％以上，匈牙利和保加利亚两国分别增长达9％。
    住宅
    1957年，苏联以国家资金和自费公助的方式建造了一百五十三万套住宅，比1956年多28％。如果按人口平均计算，苏联的住宅建设已大大超过美国、英国和法国等资本主义国家的水平。
    中国解放八年来住宅建筑面积共达九千万平方公尺，有五百万职工，连同家属共有一千七百万人搬进了新的住宅。
    在1957年里，波兰共建筑住房三十四万六千间，比1956年多建八万三千间。
    截至目前为止，罗马尼亚解放后在城市中新建的住宅面积已达二百五十多万平方公尺，保加利亚已有三分之一的居民住在解放后新建的住宅里。经济危机袭击下的资本主义国家工人生活
    现在，我们再来看看经济危机袭击下的资本主义国家的工人生活吧。
    失业
    随着美国经济危机进一步尖锐化，失业浪潮席卷了美国各大城市。据美国劳工部估计，在四十八州中，有三十州的失业人数已经超过劳动者总数的6％；全国失业人数已从1957年初的三百二十万人，增加到1958年2月的五百二十五万人，达到十六年来的最高失业人数。被垄断资本解雇最多的是钢铁、机器、飞机、汽车和耐用消费品等工业部门的工人。
    英国失业人数也在增加中。根据英国劳工部发表的数字，截至1958年3月17日止，英国失业人数比2月份又增加了九千人，达到四十三万三千人，创造了1953年1月以来英国失业人数的最高纪录。此外，3月份还有十万零三千名半失业的人，这比2月份增加了二万一千人。
    在西德，根据西德联邦劳工介绍所和失业保险局的材料，今年1月底的失业总人数是一百四十三万二千人。
    意大利目前也有二百万人的失业大军，一千二百万贫民。
    日本垄断资本集团吹嘘的所谓“神武景气”已经过去，失业问题日益严重。据经济企划厅的官方估计，今年完全失业者有五十三万人，还有数百万半失业工人。
    贫穷
    资本主义国家里日益增加的失业工人，还面临着消费品价格高涨，实际工资下降的威胁。
    据美国劳工统计局宣布，1958年2月，美国生活费用指数是一百二十二点五（1947至1949年的平均数为一百），比一年前上涨了3.2％，而在同一时期工人的实际工资却下降了5％。目前美国垄断资本竭力制止物价的下降，以便把经济危机的重担转嫁到劳动人民身上。
    英国零售物价在1957年平均上涨了4.5％，今年初仍在上涨。法国今年1月，十一种食品价格上涨剧烈，同去年同期相比，计肉类上涨了12％—14％，鸡蛋46％，马铃薯28％，某些水果80％—90％。西德今年1月的生活费用指数也比去年同期增加了4.2％。虽然这些国家工人的工资指数已赶过零售物价指数，但比起劳动生产率的增长来，实际工资增加得太少了。如今年1月英国工资指数是一一二，零售物价指数是一○八点一（均以1956年为一百）但从1956年到1957年内劳动生产率却增加了20％。
    房荒
    资本主义国家劳动人民的居住条件的恶化，同百万富翁居住豪华住宅和别墅的情况，形成鲜明的对照。
    据美国“民族”周刊说，目前美国全国有三分之一的人居住在拥挤而破烂的住宅和贫民窟内。“幸福”杂志估计，住贫民窟的有一千七百多万人。仅在纽约，就有一百五十万人住贫民窟，还有二十五万所住宅“不够规格”。
    法国房荒极为严重，目前法国至少有一百八十万户家庭是六口之家拥挤在一间小房子里。仅在巴黎，就有四十万人过着在旅馆里“轮流住宿”的生活。没有家庭的铁路工人住在车厢里已成为司空见惯之事。由于没有住宅，法国有二百五十万人过着独身生活，有29％的青年夫妇没有自己的住宅。
    在意大利，仅罗马就有五万五千多人住在地洞、破木棚和废弃了的足球场里；但另一方面却到处张贴着广告有五千多所房屋等待出租或出售。据估计，在罗马郊区要租一处有两间寝室带厨房和浴室的中等住所每月至少得付三万里拉的房租，而工人或普通职员平均只拿到四万五千到六万五千里拉的工资。
