Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: Cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building who were sent to rural areas in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, for labor training, are using their spare time to impart culture to farmers. Currently, they have established the first batch of spare-time schools in thirteen villages: one high school class, one accounting training class, eleven junior high school classes, seven senior elementary school classes, and two junior elementary school classes. In addition, they have set up seven literacy classes. More than 400 young people who did not continue their schooling and agricultural cooperative accountants have entered the accounting training class and various other classes, while more than 700 illiterate and semi-literate people have joined the literacy classes. The cadres also plan to gradually enroll all out-of-school youths in their villages and nearby areas within a certain period, eliminate existing illiteracy as soon as possible, and train a group of personnel with general accounting knowledge for the agricultural cooperatives.

These learning organizations are all set up by borrowing the original elementary school classrooms, blackboards, desks, and chairs in the villages. Expenses for kerosene lamps, teaching aids, chalk, etc., are borne by the agricultural cooperatives, and teaching reference books are generally provided by the sent-down cadres themselves. The director of the agricultural cooperative serves as the principal of the spare-time school. The current curriculum for students attending spare-time schools includes Chinese, mathematics (including abacus, algebra, and agricultural accounting), and politics. The sent-down cadres are very enthusiastic about running the schools. They participate in production during the day and mobilize students to bring their production tools to attend one or two hours of classes in the evening. After class, teachers and students participate in night labor together. Some sent-down cadres also use their daytime rest time to help students review their lessons or teach new words in the fields. In this way, most classes have achieved regular learning.

    第一机械工业部下放干部
　　在农村大办业余学校
    据新华社保定讯　第一机械工业部下放到河北省交河县农村进行劳动锻炼的干部，利用业余时间向农民传授文化，目前他们已在十三个村办起了第一批业余学校——一个高中班、一个会计训练班、十一个初中班、七个高小班和两个初小班，此外还办了七个扫盲班。有四百多个没有升学的青年和农业社会计进了会计训练班和各个班级，进扫盲班学习的文盲和半文盲也有七百多人。干部们还准备要在一定时期内逐步地吸收所在村和附近未升学的青年全部入学，并且尽快扫除现有文盲，还要为农业社培养出一批具备一般会计知识的人材。
    这些学习组织都是借用村里原有小学的课堂、黑板、桌椅等办起来的，灯油、教具、粉笔等费用由农业社负担，教学参考书一般由下放干部自备。业余学校的校长由农业社主任担任。参加业余学校的学生，现阶段的课程是语文、数学（包括珠算、代数和农业会计）、政治等。下放干部的办学热情都很高，他们白天参加生产，晚上动员学生带着生产工具去听一、两个钟点的课，下课后老师和学生就一起去参加夜间劳动。有些下放干部还利用白天休息时间，在地头帮助学生复习功课或教生字。这样，多数班作到了学习经常化。
