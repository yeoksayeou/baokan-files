Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 20th (TASS): The German News Agency rebroadcasted a broadcast from the German Free Radio Station 904 regarding the communique of the 9th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party held in May.

    The First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a report at the Central Committee plenary session titled: "Continue the Nationwide Struggle Against the Nuclear Armament of the Federal Republic and the Tasks of the Party."

    In his report, Reimann said that the masses of people have risen up against Adenauer's policy of nuclear armament, and this development fully confirms the assessment made by the 8th Plenary Session of the German Communist Party Central Committee that the mood within West Germany has begun to turn. Mass rallies, strikes, and demonstrations show that the working class is increasingly becoming the leading force of the people's movement.

    Reimann pointed out that the alliance between the working class and intellectuals that has emerged in the struggle against the nuclear threat is of great significance.

    The Central Committee of the German Communist Party called on all party members to strengthen cooperation with the West German Social Democratic Party in order to stop nuclear armament.

    The Central Plenary Session approved the summary report of the Political Bureau and adopted Reimann's report.

    The Central Plenary Session also adopted a letter to the West German Social Democratic Party Congress being held in Stuttgart. The letter emphasized that if the Social Democratic Party, the German Communist Party, and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the West German Trade Union Federation, and the Free German Trade Union Federation reach an agreement on taking joint measures on issues such as opposing nuclear armament and striving to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, then the actions of the German working class would be unified, and a force would be generated that could guarantee peace and eliminate all obstacles on the road to the peaceful reunification of Germany.

    德共中央呼吁社会民主党
    共同制止西德原子武装
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社柏林19日讯：德意志通讯社转播了德国九○四自由广播电台播发的关于德国共产党中央委员会在5月里举行的第九次全体会议的公报。
    德共中央第一书记雷曼在中央全会上作了报告，题目是：“继续进行反对联邦共和国原子武装的全民斗争和党的任务”。
    雷曼在报告中说，人民群众已经起来反对阿登纳所奉行的原子武装政策，这种发展完全证实了德共中央第八次全会所作出的西德国内的情绪已开始转折的估计。群众大会、罢工和示威游行表明，工人阶级日益成为人民运动的领导力量。
    雷曼指出，在反对原子威胁的斗争中产生的工人阶级同知识分子的联盟具有重要意义。
    德共中央委员会号召全体党员加强同西德社会民主党的合作，以便制止原子武装。
    中央全会批准了政治局的工作总结报告，并且通过了雷曼的报告。
    中央全会还通过了一封写给正在斯各加特举行的西德社会民主党代表大会的信。信中强调指出，如果社会民主党、德国共产党和德国统一社会党、西德工会联合会和自由德国工会联合会就反对原子武装、争取在欧洲建立无原子武器区等问题达成采取联合措施的协议，那么德国工人阶级的行动就一致了，就能产生一种可以保证和平和消除通向德国和平统一的道路上的一切障碍的力量。
