    A Good Poem
    The Qing Dynasty is repairing temples;
    Chiang Kai-shek is making trouble;
    Chairman Mao is calling on people to dig cellars.
    When the cellar is full of oil,
    There will be no worry about food and clothing.
    This is a new folk song circulating in Pucheng, Shaanxi, and the author is an elderly farmer.
    This poem is good because it uses only twenty-nine characters to write about several hundred years and a comparison of three different eras. This poem is good because it has the pure language and rich imagination of farmers: water is described as "oil" and expresses the joy of "no worry about food and clothing." This poem is good because it is full of Guanzhong folk flavor.

    一首好诗
    清家修庙哩；
    蒋介石胡闹哩；
    毛主席叫人打窖哩。
    窖里有了油，
    吃穿不发愁。
    这是在陕西蒲城流传的一首新山歌，作者是一位年迈苍苍的农民。
    这诗好，它仅仅用了二十九个字，就写了几百年，写了三个不同时代的对比。这诗好，它有农民的纯朴语言，丰富想像：水说成“油”而且道出了“吃穿不发愁”的喜悦。这诗好，它富有关中民间风味。
                  （杨同州）
