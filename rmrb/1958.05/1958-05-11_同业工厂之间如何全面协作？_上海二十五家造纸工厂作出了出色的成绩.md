Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Li reports: How can factories in the same industry fully collaborate and support each other in the competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced, so as to achieve simultaneous progress and common improvement? Shanghai's twenty-five paper mills have set a good example in this regard. In the Great Leap Forward, they conducted extensive adjustments and mutual assistance in equipment, raw materials, technology, and personnel. Based on close cooperation, they launched a competition, tapping into the potential of materials and manpower in large quantities. Currently, without increasing equipment and workers, the production of each factory has generally reached the level originally planned for 1962. In March, paper production exceeded the plan by more than 2,000 tons; in April, it leaped forward another 380 tons compared to March.

In mid-March, Shanghai's twenty-five paper mills launched an unprecedented wave of mutual support under the slogan of striving for collective advancement in the city's paper industry. Knowing that its rival, Lihua Paper Mill, wanted to speed up production, but lacked a motor, the China Paper Company took the initiative to send a 25-horsepower motor. Lihua Mill also lent a motor that it had been reluctant to lend in the past to Dali Mill to help them accelerate. After the speed of each factory increased, more raw materials were used. When materials from other places couldn't arrive in time, several large factories, despite their own tightness, saw that one day's worth of their raw materials could help the small factories for several days, so they all took out their stored materials for the brother factories to use first. Shenzhou, Zhonghe, and other small factories, hearing that the large factories were speeding up and lacked bamboo pulp, also came to support the large factories. When factories such as Tianfeng and Zhonghe sped up and lacked equipment maintenance workers, Tianzhang, Jiangnan, and Guofeng factories immediately sent their own fitters, carpenters, and electricians to help when they found out.

As a result of such extensive collaboration, the role of the original equipment and manpower of Shanghai's paper industry was greatly enhanced, and production leaped forward significantly. Lihua Mill installed the motor borrowed from China Paper Company on No. 1 paper machine, and the speed immediately increased from 89 meters per minute to 112 meters per minute. The motor from No. 1 machine was replaced on No. 2 machine, and the output of No. 2 machine also increased by about 40%. Guofeng Mill borrowed two large motors from Baoshan and Zhongni Mills, and gave the original two small motors to other mills. In the past two months, nearly twenty motors have been exchanged in this way, and now they are all in their proper places, playing the greatest role. After the maintenance workers supported each other, on the one hand, they changed the phenomenon of being too idle at times and too busy at others; on the other hand, because the machines in each factory came from different countries and had different performance characteristics, they became familiar with the performance of different machines through mutual maintenance, which improved the quality of maintenance work. After the raw materials were adjusted to each other, good materials were used to make good paper, and inferior materials were used to make inferior paper, which reduced the waste caused by unreasonable use. In addition, by exchanging operating experience, the production costs of paper in each factory have also been generally reduced recently.

Although there are many paper mills in Shanghai, the equipment is old and scattered, and the gap between the advanced and the backward factories is still large. Therefore, in the competition, it is necessary to establish a sense of the whole, overcome the narrow-minded departmentalism of only caring about one's own leap forward, and strive for the collective advancement of the entire industry. Recently, the Party organizations of each factory have also strengthened the ideological education of collectivism among the workers. Many paper mill workers have proposed: no matter how big or small the factory, no matter how new or old the equipment, no matter how high or low the technology, no matter how much or little the raw materials, brother factories should have whatever they need, and one's own factory should give whatever it has. Shanghai and Tianjin Paper Industries Sign Comprehensive Cooperation Contract.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 10th. The paper industry departments of Shanghai and Tianjin recently signed a comprehensive cooperation contract in Shanghai. This is one of the earliest industries in the two places to implement comprehensive mutual assistance and cooperation in light industry.

The scope of the cooperation contract signed this time is very broad, including technology, production, management, and other aspects. The contract stipulates that both parties must inform the other of the production status and economic indicators (including raw material consumption, production costs, quality testing, etc.) of various types of paper in their respective regions every month; after a new product is successfully tested, all the information and samples must be sent to the other party; when the factories in the two places encounter difficulties in equipment manufacturing and repair, or when major problems occur in production, technology, and equipment, both parties must actively find ways to help solve them.

### 同业工厂之间如何全面协作？  上海二十五家造纸工厂作出了出色的成绩

　　同业工厂之间如何全面协作？
　　上海二十五家造纸工厂作出了出色的成绩
    据新华社上海10日电　新华社记者周立报道：同业工厂之间怎样在比先进赶先进的竞赛中全面协作、相互支援，做到并驾齐驱、共同提高？上海二十五家造纸厂在这方面作出了很好的榜样。它们在大跃进中，在设备、原料、技术、人员方面进行广泛的调剂和互助，在相互密切协作的基础上展开竞赛，把物力和人力的潜力大量地挖掘出来。目前，各厂在没有增加设备和工人的情况下，生产已经普遍达到原来规划要在1962年才能达到的水平。3月份，纸张产量超过计划二千多吨；4月份又比3月份跃进了三百八十吨。
    上海二十五家造纸厂3月中旬在争取全市造纸工业集体先进的口号下，掀起了一个空前的相互支援的热潮。中国版纸公司知道同自己竞赛的对手——利华造纸厂要开快车速，但是缺少一只马达，他们便主动把一只二十五马力的马达送去；利华厂也把过去不大愿意出借的一只马达借给了大澧厂，帮助他们加快车速。各厂车速加快以后，原料用多了，外地来不及运来，几个大厂尽管本厂也很紧张，但他们看到自己一天的原料可以救小厂几天的急，就都把储料拿来给兄弟厂先用。神州、中和等几个小厂听到大厂开快车速，竹浆不够，也都前来支援大厂。天丰、中和等厂车速加快，设备检修工人不够，天章、江南、国丰几个厂知道了，马上派自己厂里的钳工、木工、电工前去帮忙。
    这样广泛协作的结果，使上海造纸业原有设备和人力的作用大大发挥，生产大大向前跃进一步。利华厂把中版公司借来的一只马达装在一号纸机上，车速马上从每分钟八十九公尺提高到一百一十二公尺。一号机上的马达换下来装在二号机上，二号机产量也提高了40％左右。国丰厂从宝山、中泥两厂借来两只大马达，把原来的两只小马达给了别的厂。像这样互相换用的马达，两个月来共有近二十只，现在它们都各得其所，发挥了最大的作用。检修工人相互支援以后，一方面改变了他们过去空时太空、忙时太忙的现象，另一方面因为各厂机器来自各国，性能不一，通过互相检修，熟悉了不同机器的性能，提高了检修工作的质量。原材料经过相互调剂，使用上也做到好料做好纸、次料做次纸，减少了使用不合理所造成的浪费。加上相互交流操作经验，各厂纸张的生产成本最近也都普遍降低。
    上海造纸业工厂虽多，但设备较旧而且分散，工厂之间先进和落后的差距还很大。因此，在竞赛中必须树立整体观念，克服光顾自己跃进的本位主义思想，争取全业的集体先进。各厂党组织最近在广大职工中也加强了集体主义的思想教育。许多纸厂职工都提出：工厂不论大小，设备不论新旧，技术不论高低，原料不论多少，兄弟厂要啥有啥，自己厂有啥给啥。上海天津造纸工业签订全面协作合同
    据新华社上海10日电　上海、天津的造纸工业部门最近在上海签订了一个全面协作的合同。这是两地轻工业中实行全面互助协作最早的一个行业。
    这次签订的协作合同范围很广，包括技术、生产、管理等各个方面。合同上规定，双方以后每个月都要把本地各种纸张的生产情况和经济指标（包括原料消耗、生产成本、质量化验等）告诉对方；新产品试验成功后，也要把全部资料连同样品寄给对方；两地工厂在设备制造修理上发生困难，在生产、技术和设备上发生重大问题的时候，双方都要积极设法帮助解决。
