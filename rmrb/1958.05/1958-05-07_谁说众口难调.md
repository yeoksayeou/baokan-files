    Who Says It's Hard to Please Everyone?
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Zhiqing
    The proverb "It's hard to please everyone" has been disproven by Li Xiangshou, a waiter at the No. 1 service counter of the You Yi Shun Halal Restaurant in Xidan, Beijing. He not only manages to provide enthusiastic service when there are few customers, but also takes good care of everyone when there are many, ensuring that no one feels neglected. He pays attention to the personalities of customers from different professions and adopts different reception methods. For example, he has observed that some intellectuals, traditional Chinese medicine doctors, and actors are relatively quiet and speak softly, so he receives them in a calm and unhurried manner. Workers who are straightforward prefer directness, so he responds to them with quick and friendly replies.
    He is good at studying the different tastes and requirements of various customers. If someone comes alone, he can judge that they are out for work, don't have time to go home for a meal, or have urgent business to attend to. Based on whether the customer has spare time, he asks about their preferences and arranges the time for their dishes to be prepared. When three or five customers come together, he understands that they are likely there for a meal together, so he proactively introduces new and seasonal dishes, allowing them to enjoy a satisfying meal. Once, some customers didn't want to eat fish, and others didn't want to eat chicken, so he took the initiative to give them ideas. In addition to separately preparing various dishes according to different people's tastes and requirements, he also provided them with a Mongolian hot pot. The customers were eating it for the first time and didn't know how to mix the seasonings, so he personally demonstrated it for them. The customers ate very deliciously and laughed happily as they ate.
    He is particularly concerned about patients and the elderly. One customer was suffering from a toothache and couldn't find a suitable meal after visiting two or three restaurants. After learning about the customer's situation, Li Xiangshou thought for a moment and said, "How about this? I'll get you something soft to look at first, and if it doesn't work, we'll think of another way." The patient waited quietly, and soon a bowl of hot, smooth "Liu Huang Cai" (a type of egg-drop soup) was brought over. The patient ate it comfortably and said with gratitude, "The No. 1 waiter is truly lovable." One customer went to dinner with four friends, but he himself didn't eat. Li Xiangshou noticed that his face was flushed and his voice was different from usual. He guessed that he had caught a cold, so he recommended a hot noodle soup to him. An elderly woman in her seventies with no teeth asked for stir-fried sliced pork with sweet and sour sauce. If it were a regular customer, he would of course prepare the dish according to the customer's wishes, but he was afraid that the old lady wouldn't be able to chew it, so he recommended "芙蓉鸡片" (芙蓉 chicken slices) and "珍珠三仙汤" (pearl three-delicacy soup), so that the old lady could chew it easily and it would be nutritious.
    Li Xiangshou knows that reflecting customer opinions to the chefs is the best way to encourage them to prepare good food. Whenever he hears customer feedback, he discusses it with the chefs in a timely manner. Once, chef Yang Guotong used winter melon, shrimp, dried shrimp, and other ingredients to make a seasonal dish called "Shrimp Finding Nest," which was tender in color, delicious, and palatable. The customers praised it, saying "Good dish, good dish!" After hearing this, Li Xiangshou introduced the customers to Yang Guotong. The customers shook Yang Guotong's hand and thanked him.
    Li Xiangshou said, "I wasn't like this in the past. Before liberation, the people who went to restaurants were wealthy and powerful, and the waiters always served them with bowed heads and bent waists. After eating, they still had to thank them, while those bloated and greasy people wouldn't even move the muscles on their faces and swaggered away. Sometimes, they would even scold and beat us. Now, the people who come to You Yi Shun for dinner are workers, cadres, and peasants. They are all our own people. No matter how hard it is, it's still a pleasure in my heart." He has recently received more than seventy written commendations from customers. (Attached picture)

    谁说众口难调
    本报记者　张志清
    “众口难调”这句俗语，被北京西单又一顺清真饭馆一号服务员李祥寿打破了。他不只能作到在顾客少时人人受到热诚招待，在顾客多时也照顾得很周到，使谁也不感到冷待。他注意不同职业的顾客的性格，采用不同的接待方法。如他发现有些知识分子、中医师、戏剧演员，都比较文静，说起话来都是慢声细语的，他就从容不迫的接待他们。性格坦率的工人喜欢直爽，他对答的也就爽快亲切。
    他善于研究各种顾客的不同口味和要求。如果是一个人来的，就可以判断他是出来工作，来不及回家吃饭或者是有急事要办，他就根据顾客有无空余时间，询问他们的口味，替顾客安排好等菜饭的时间。三、五个一起来的顾客，他就懂得多半是来聚餐的，就主动介绍他们吃新菜和时菜，让顾客们痛痛快快的吃一顿。一次，有几位客人这个不吃鱼，那个不吃鸡，他就主动的给顾客们出了主意，除根据不同人的口味和要求分别不同的配了各种菜外，还给他们配了一个涮羊肉。顾客们初次吃，不知道怎样配作料，他便亲手给他们作了表演。顾客们吃的很可口，一边吃一边高兴的笑。
    他特别关心病人和老人。有一个顾客因为闹牙痛，走了两三家饭馆找不到合适的饭吃，李祥寿知道了这位顾客的心情后想了想说：这么办吧，我去给你弄点软的来你先看一看，不成再想办法。病人安静的等着，不一会儿，端来了一碗热腾腾的溜黄菜，病人舒适的吃了感动的说，一号服务员真叫人喜爱。一位顾客同着四位朋友去吃饭，他自己却不吃，李祥寿看到他面红耳赤，说话的声音异与常人，他估计到是受感冒了，这时他就介绍他吃热汤面。有一位七十多岁没有牙的老太太，进门后要吃焦溜肉片，若是一般顾客当然要按照顾客的意见配菜，但是他怕老太太嚼不动，就介绍她吃芙蓉鸡片和珍珠三仙汤，这样老太太既嚼得动又富于营养。
  李祥寿知道把顾客的意见反映给掌灶厨师，是鼓舞厨师做好饭菜的最好方法，每当听到顾客的意见后，就及时同厨师进行研究。有一次厨师杨国桐用冬瓜、虾仁、虾米等做成的一个时菜叫做“虾米寻窝”，做得颜色娇嫩，味美可口，顾客们吃着不住的称赞“好菜，好菜”。李祥寿听了后就介绍顾客和杨国桐见面。顾客们握住杨国桐的手，向他道谢。
    李祥寿说，我过去不是这样的，解放前，下饭馆的都是有钱有势的人，做“跑堂”的总是低头哈腰地侍候着，吃完还得向他们去道谢，而那些脑满肠肥的人，连脸上的肌肉都不动一动，大摇大摆地就走了，有时还得挨他们打骂。现在到又一顺来吃饭的人是工人、干部、农民，都是自己人了，多么辛苦心眼里也是痛快。他最近已得到顾客七十多次书面表扬。（附图片）
