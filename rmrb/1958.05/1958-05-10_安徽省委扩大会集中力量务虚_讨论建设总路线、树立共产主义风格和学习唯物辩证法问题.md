    Anhui Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting Concentrates on Theoretical Discussions
    Discussing the General Line of Construction, Establishing a Communist Style, and Studying Materialist Dialectics

    (Our Dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its Seventh Enlarged Meeting in late April, with the participation of secretaries from prefectural and county Party committees. This meeting was conducted in the spirit of emphasizing the theoretical to drive the practical, and using politics to lead professional work. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, conveyed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and devoted a significant amount of time to earnest study and discussion. The meeting also allocated some time to study and arrange current production work and preparations for next year's large-scale production.

    The meeting focused on studying the question of the general line of construction of "more, faster, better, and more economical, exert all efforts, aim high," discussed the issue of the Communist style, and also discussed the study of materialist dialectics. The meeting held that the correctness of this construction line has been proven by countless facts in China's socialist construction. This line, like a lighthouse, illuminates the thinking of the vast number of cadres and masses, stimulates the enthusiasm of the entire Party and the entire people in building socialism, and has already generated a huge mobilizing and organizing role in practical work. However, many comrades, when examining their previous understanding of this line, found it was not very profound. They simply felt, based on the needs of Anhui's actual situation, that they should exert all efforts to make our construction undertakings more, faster, better, and more economical, but they did not realize that this is a universal truth for building socialism. After several days of study and discussion, everyone's understanding was raised.

    The practice of simultaneous leaps forward in various tasks across the province since last winter and this spring proves that the general line of building socialism of exerting all efforts, aiming high, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results is completely correct.

    The meeting pointed out that the correctness of this line has also been proven by Anhui's practice. As early as last winter, the province had already seen a great leap forward in agricultural production centered on water conservancy. As of the end of April, more than 5 billion cubic meters of water conservancy projects had been completed, more than two and a half times the total amount of water conservancy construction in the eight years since liberation. More than 75 billion dan of fertilizer had been accumulated, more than twice the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the eight years since liberation. More than 32 million mu of afforestation had been carried out, more than four times the total amount of afforestation in the eight years since liberation. Spring plowing and sowing were also done earlier and better than in previous years. The leap forward in agricultural production has promoted the leap forward in industrial production, cultural education, the elimination of the four pests, schistosomiasis prevention, and other tasks. These tasks, on the basis of the Party and the people's rectification campaign, and driven by the pioneering water conservancy work, promoted and influenced each other like a chain reaction, quickly forming a situation of simultaneous leaps forward. Things that were previously thought to be impossible or only possible in the distant future have either become reality in a short period of time or are about to become reality. For example, the conversion of Huai Bei to rice cultivation has reached more than 7 million mu this year, and the inspiring slogan of "harnessing water, planting rice, and eating rice" will soon be universally realized. Another example is the long-standing custom in Huai Bei of "people without toilets and pigs without pens," which was completely changed in a short period of time during the upsurge of fertilizer accumulation last winter and this spring. These facts all prove that as long as we resolutely continue to advance along the construction line of "more, faster, better, and more economical, exert all efforts, aim high," we will certainly be able to achieve the forty articles in agriculture in five years or a little longer, and the output value of local industry will certainly be able to catch up with and surpass the output value of agriculture in five to seven years.

    The Provincial Party Committee resisted the "anti-rash advance" trend that emerged in the second half of 1956. Last year, it also achieved a victory in criticizing right-leaning conservative thought and the great debate on the two roads in rural areas, laying the political and ideological foundation for the subsequent great leap forward in production. This fully demonstrates the great significance of politics as the commander.

    The meeting also reviewed the development of Anhui's work in previous years. The meeting pointed out that thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Anhui's work in previous years was also basically in line with the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. The Provincial Party Committee resisted the "anti-rash advance" trend that emerged in the second half of 1956 and carried out multiple criticisms, but due to the low level of Marxism-Leninism and the lack of deep understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings, these criticisms were still very superficial. At this meeting, under the call to speak from the heart, many comrades talked about their past dissatisfaction with the Provincial Party Committee's failure to engage in "anti-rash advance" at the time, not making "rash advances," and instead criticizing right-leaning conservatism. After this meeting, they deeply realized their mistakes. The meeting also pointed out that due to the influence of the "anti-rash advance" trend at the time, production and other work suffered losses of varying degrees. In the spring of 1957, Anhui launched a criticism of capitalist ideology and individualism in rural areas, repelling the counter-current of anti-socialism in rural areas. Especially in the anti-rightist struggle, it achieved a basic victory in the struggle between the two roads. In August, November, and December of last year, the Provincial Party Committee convened three cadre meetings with more than a thousand people to carry out rectification and anti-rightist struggles, and concentrated on criticizing the right-leaning conservative thought and the thought of dependence that hindered the development of production. At the same time, it launched a great debate on the two roads in rural areas, thereby greatly raising the socialist consciousness of the broad masses and laying the political and ideological foundation for the subsequent leap forward in production. This fully demonstrates the great significance of politics as the commander, using politics to lead professional work, and emphasizing the theoretical to drive the practical.

    All new things are often surrounded by old things. In order to promote the development of new things, we must have the fearless Communist style of daring to oppose counter-currents and break through encirclements.

    At the meeting, everyone deeply realized that to correctly implement the construction line of the Party Central Committee, we must earnestly cultivate and promote the Communist style throughout the Party, and we must educate cadres to have the spirit of sweeping away all obstacles and being at a commanding height, the perseverance to adhere to principles and safeguard the truth, and the originality to break with conventions and dare to think and act. The meeting held that although the people of Anhui have long been in a difficult environment with many disasters, they have not bowed their heads in the face of difficulties. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, they have broken through the shackles of dogmatism, empiricism, and right-leaning conservative thought, achieved cooperativization ahead of schedule, actively carried out production reforms, overcome natural disasters, developed production, and begun to change their backward situation. However, the new overcoming the old, and the promotion overcoming the regression, must go through many struggles. All new things, when they are just budding, are often under the suppression and encirclement of old ideas, old customs, and old rules and regulations. In order to promote the development of new things, we must have a fearless fighting spirit, dare to oppose counter-currents, "break through encirclements," and not be afraid of temporary isolation or temporary blows. According to Anhui's experience in ideological struggle, whenever the Party and the people encounter difficulties (such as major natural disasters), regressionists will only "comment and criticize," pour cold water, stir up typhoons, and harm new things, harming the people's enthusiasm for building socialism. Under these circumstances, we should unswervingly resist this counter-current and seek the great development of new things by breaking through the encirclement of regressionist thought. Anhui's cooperativization movement and production reform movement have both developed in the struggle against this counter-current. However, some comrades, in the face of this counter-current, either because of personal gains and losses, or because of their low ideological level, swayed from side to side and could not stand firm. At the meeting, some comrades examined that the large-scale communes they set up in their areas had been criticized and criticized. Although they did not accept this criticism ideologically, and many facts also proved the superiority of the large-scale communes, they did not dare to conduct debates with justification. Last year, many counties reduced double-cropping rice, reduced water conservancy projects, etc., which were also affected by the counter-current. These are all serious lessons.

    In practical work, respecting materialism and applying dialectics are of great significance. We must constantly publicize materialist dialectics among the people.

    When discussing the issue of studying materialist dialectics, the meeting further recognized that to study problems and carry out work, we must proceed from reality, grasp the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," analyze things comprehensively, distinguish between the main stream and the side streams, grasp the essence of things, be good at establishing opposites, and be good at grasping both ends and leading the middle. Facts have proven that respecting materialism and applying dialectics in practical work is of great significance. In the upsurge of promoting industrial and agricultural production last winter and this spring, all localities proceeded by conducting mutual observation, comparison, holding on-site meetings, and timely publicizing comparative methods of work progress charts. Precisely because these methods have grasped the opposites and are in line with the dialectical method, the work appears lively and vigorous. In order to continue to strengthen the study and research of dialectics and strengthen the leadership of theoretical work, the meeting decided that theoretical publications must be well-managed, and the secretaries of Party committees at all levels must personally grasp theoretical work, must write articles for theoretical publications, and must also constantly publicize materialist dialectics among the people, and instructed Party newspapers and periodicals at all levels to take more responsibility in this regard.

    The meeting made arrangements for current work, which mainly involves grasping deep plowing, grasping fertilizer, grasping close planting, grasping field management, grasping soil improvement, and grasping the improvement of agricultural tools.

    The meeting studied and arranged current work. The meeting pointed out that to do a good job in agricultural production, the key is leadership. Leading cadres at all levels must earnestly do a good job in experimental fields, pointing out that only by personally doing things, setting an example, and achieving results can production leadership convince and educate others. It was pointed out that agricultural production must set advanced and reasonable targets, but it is even more necessary to come up with various measures to achieve the targets, and the targets must be based on measures. On the current production issues, it was emphasized that we must grasp deep plowing, grasp fertilizer, grasp close planting, grasp field management, grasp soil improvement, and grasp the improvement of agricultural tools. At present, some wheat fields in some areas have been found to have diseases and pests, which must be extinguished immediately. The large amount of fertilizer accumulated this year must be transported to the fields in a timely manner. Regarding the development of industry, the meeting pointed out that the enthusiasm for developing local industry is currently very high. In order to make industrial development meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results, in addition to developing the machinery industry as much as possible under possible conditions, we should focus on developing handicrafts, and should develop according to the principle of from small to large and from low-level to high-level. Technology must be handed over to all levels and to the masses for development, because only in this way can the unlimited potential of the masses be brought into play. After discussing the development route of industry, the call for organizing cooperation among several counties, several townships, and several communes was put forward, and the cooperation method was widely promoted. Regarding the rectification campaign, the meeting pointed out that the current double-anti movement has achieved great results, greatly sweeping away the "three evil winds" and "five evil spirits," and a new atmosphere has emerged. The current problem is that some units are closing the door for rectification and reform under the leadership, or are only focusing on practical matters and not on theoretical matters in the rectification and reform. Therefore, we must pay attention to strengthening the leadership of the rectification campaign and carry out the rectification movement to the end, especially pointing out that the mass line should be implemented in the rectification and reform, and the thematic airing of views should be carried out from the theoretical to the practical, so as to truly achieve political command. The rural rectification campaign should be combined with production, and the principle of presenting facts and reasoning should be implemented. The problems left over after the rectification of the three types of communes should be checked, and those that need to be made up should be made up. The first and second types of communes should be rectified by the end of June in conjunction with production.

    The meeting believed that Anhui Province's agricultural production can achieve a great leap forward this year, and an important reason is that the various preparatory work last year was done early. Based on the experience that preparatory work for production should be done sooner rather than later, the meeting made preliminary studies on Anhui's production, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, seeds, tools, and farming techniques for next year. It was required that all localities in the province start accumulating fertilizer for next year after July, and start preparing now for deep plowing and close planting for autumn wheat sowing, and preparing for good rice varieties for next year.

    At this meeting, the observation groups sent by the Provincial Party Committee to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Shandong and other places reported on their visits, and introduced the advanced experiences of various fraternal provinces in production, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, farming techniques, leadership methods, and other aspects of work. The comrades who attended the meeting earnestly discussed and studied them, and unanimously believed that these advanced experiences were very valuable and of great help to the development of industrial and agricultural production in Anhui. Everyone expressed that they must learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced.

    At the end of the meeting, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a summary. He answered many theoretical questions and questions of understanding raised by everyone in studying the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao one by one, and criticized some erroneous views. He especially emphasized the need for Party committees at all levels to grasp political and ideological work. Regarding the current production work, he pointed out that various measures to increase production must be taken to strive for a bumper harvest this year, and required all localities to summarize this year's experiences and lessons and make various ideological and material preparations for next year's production. He also pointed out that we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of fraternal provinces, and the provinces must also observe and learn from each other to prevent and overcome complacency. Finally, he called: We must resolutely implement the socialist construction line of "more, faster, better, and more economical, exert all efforts, aim high," actively promote the Communist style, and strive to study materialist dialectics, so that our thinking will continue to leap forward and our production will continue to push to new heights.

    安徽省委扩大会集中力量务虚
    讨论建设总路线、树立共产主义风格和学习唯物辩证法问题
    本报讯　中共安徽省委在4月下旬召开了有地委、县委书记参加的第七次扩大会议。这次会议是在以虚带实、以政治带业务的精神下进行的。会议由省委第一书记曾希圣同志传达了党中央和毛主席的指示，并以较多的时间进行了认真的学习和讨论。会议对当前生产工作，对明年大生产的准备工作，也抽出一点时间作了研究和安排。
    会议着重学习了“多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游”的建设路线问题，讨论了共产主义风格问题，还讨论了学习唯物辩证法问题。会议认为：这条建设路线的正确性已为我国社会主义建设中无数事实所证明。这条路线像一座灯塔一样照亮了广大干部和群众的思想，激发了全党和全民的建设社会主义的干劲，在实际工作中已经产生了巨大的动员作用和组织作用。但很多同志检查自己在以前对这条路线的认识，并不是很深刻的，只是根据安徽实际情况的需要朴素的感觉到应该鼓足干劲，把我们的建设事业做得多些、快些、好些、省些，却没有理会到这是建设社会主义的普遍真理。经过几天的学习和讨论，大家都提高了认识。
    去冬今春全省各项工作齐头跃进的实践证明，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线完全正确。
    会议指出：这条路线的正确性，从安徽的实践中也同样得到了证明。早在去年冬季，全省即已出现了以水利为中心的农业生产大跃进局面。到4月底为止，水利已完成五十亿方以上，超过解放八年兴修水利总和的二倍半以上；积肥达到七百五十多亿担，为解放八年积肥总数的二倍以上；造林三千二百多万亩，为解放八年造林总和的四倍以上；春耕春种也比往年做得早，做得好。农业生产的跃进，推动了工业生产、文化教育、除四害、血防等工作的跃进。这些工作在全党、全民整风的基础上，在一马当先的水利工作的带动下，像原子的连锁反应一样，相互促进，相互影响，很快地形成了齐头跃进的局面。过去认为根本做不到的事或认为只能是遥远的将来才能办到的事，有的在短期内已经变成现实，有的即将变成现实。如淮北改种水稻，今年达到七百多万亩，“治水种稻吃大米”这个鼓舞人心的口号很快的就要普遍实现；又如淮北千百年传下来的“人无厕所猪无圈”的陋习，在去冬今春积肥高潮中的一段短短时间内就完全改变了面貌。这些事实都证明，只要坚决沿着“多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游”的建设路线继续前进，就一定可以做到农业在五年或多一点的时间内实现四十条，地方工业的产值就一定可以在五到七年内赶上和超过农业的产值。
    1956年下半年出现的“反冒进”歪风被省委顶住了。去年又取得了批判右倾保守思想和农村两条道路大辩论的胜利，为后来的生产大跃进奠定了政治思想基础，这充分说明政治是统帅的重大意义。
    会议还回溯了以往几年安徽工作的发展状况。会议指出：由于党中央的正确领导，安徽以往几年的工作，也基本上是符合多快好省要求的，省委对1956年下半年出现的“反冒进”歪风是顶住了的，是进行过多次批判的，但由于马列主义水准不高、对毛主席的教导理解不深，这种批判还是很粗浅的。这次会议在说心里话的号召下，有不少同志讲到过去对省委当时不搞“反冒进”，不做“冒进”了的检讨，反而批判右倾保守曾有不满情绪。他们在这次会议后深刻认识到自己的错误。会议同时指出，由于当时反冒进歪风的影响，曾使生产和其他工作受到程度不同的损失。1957年春安徽农村中开展了对资本主义思想和个人主义的批判，击退了农村反社会主义的逆流；特别在反右派斗争中，更取得两条道路斗争的基本胜利；去年8月、11月、12月省委召开了三次千人以上的干部大会，进行整风反右派，并集中地批判了障碍生产发展的右倾保守思想和依赖思想，同时又在农村中间展开两条道路的大辩论，从而大大提高了广大群众的社会主义觉悟，为后来的生产跃进奠定了政治思想基础。这就完全说明了政治是统帅、以政治带业务、以虚带实的重大意义。
    一切新生的事物常常处在旧事物的包围中，为了促进新事物的发展，必须具有敢于反对逆流，杀出重围的大无畏的共产主义风格。
    会议上大家深深体会到，正确贯彻党中央的建设路线，必须在全党认真培养和发扬共产主义的风格，必须教育干部要有势如破竹、高屋建瓴的气概，要有坚持原则、维护真理的毅力，要有打破常规、敢想敢做的独创精神。会议认为：长期以来，安徽人民虽然处在多灾的困难环境，但是他们并没有在困难面前低头。几年来他们在党的领导下，冲破了教条主义、经验主义和右倾保守思想的束缚，提前实现了合作化，积极地进行着生产改革，战胜了灾荒，发展了生产，开始改变了落后面貌。但是新的战胜旧的，促进战胜促退，是须要经过许多斗争的。一切新生的事物，当它刚刚萌芽的时候，常常处在旧思想、旧习俗、旧规章的压抑和包围之下，为了促进新生事物的发展，就必须具有大无畏的斗争精神，敢于反对逆流“杀出重围”，不怕暂时的孤立，不怕暂时的打击。根据安徽思想斗争的体会，每当党和人民遭遇到困难（如大的自然灾害）的时候，促退主义者就只会“评头品足”泼冷水、刮起台风，伤害新生事物，伤害人民建设社会主义的积极性。在这种情况下，应该毫不让步地顶住这种逆流，从击破促退思想的包围中，求得新生事物的大大发展。安徽的合作化运动和生产改革运动，都是在和这股逆流进行斗争中发展起来的。但是也有些同志在这种逆流面前，或者由于个人患得患失，或者由于思想水平不高，东摇西摆，站不稳脚根。会议上有些同志检查了他们地区办的大社多曾受到责难和批评，虽然他们思想上并不接受这种批评，许多事实也证明了大社的优越性，但却不敢理直气壮地进行辩论。去年许多县都减少了双季稻，减少了水利工程等等，同样是受到逆流的影响。这些都是严重的教训。
    在实际工作中，尊重唯物主义和运用辩证法意义很大，必须在人民群众中经常宣传唯物辩证法。
    会议在讨论到关于学习唯物辩证法问题时，进一步认识到，研究问题和进行工作，一定要从实际出发，要掌握“从群众中来，到群众中去”的法则，对事物要全面分析，要分清主流和支流，抓住事物本质；要善于树立对立面，善于抓两头、带中间。事实证明：在实际工作中尊重唯物主义和运用辩证法具有十分重大的意义。去冬今春在推动工农业生产的高潮中，各地都是按照相互观摩、评比、开现场会议，及时公布工作进度表的比较法进行的。正因为这些办法都抓住了对立面，都符合辩证的方法，所以工作就显得生动活泼。今后为了继续加强辩证法的学习和研究，加强理论工作的领导，会议决定必须办好理论刊物，各级党委书记必须亲自抓理论工作，必须为理论刊物撰写稿件，同时还必须在人民群众中经常宣传唯物辩证法，并责成各级党的报刊要在这方面负起更多的责任。
    会议对当前工作作了安排，当前主要要抓深耕，抓肥料，抓密植，抓田间管理，抓改良土壤，抓改良农具。
    会议对当前工作作了研究和安排。会议指出：要搞好农业生产工作，主要是领导问题。各级领导干部要认真搞好试验田，指出生产领导只有亲自动手，做出样子，取得成绩，才能说服教育别人；指出农业生产必须订出先进的合理的指标，但更需想出实现指标的各种措施，要把指标建立在措施基础上。对当前生产问题强调指出要抓深耕、抓肥料、抓密植、抓田间管理、抓改良土壤、抓改良农具等问题。目前有些地区的麦田已发现病害、虫害，必须立即扑灭。今年积蓄的大量肥料要及时运到田里。关于发展工业，会议指出，当前地方发展工业的积极性很高，为了使工业发展达到多快好省的要求，除在可能条件下尽量发展机械工业外，应着重发展手工业，应按由小到大，由低级到高级的原则来进行发展，要把技术交给各级、交给群众来进行发展，因为只有这样才能发挥群众的无限潜力。在讨论了发展工业路线之后，又提出了以若干县若干乡若干社组织协作的号召，把协作办法普遍推广。关于整风问题，会议指出，当前双反运动已获得很大成绩，大大扫除了“三种歪风”“五种邪气”，出现了一片新气象。当前的问题是：有些单位领导上关门整改，或者是在整改中只务实，不务虚。因此，必须注意加强整风领导，将整风运动进行到底，特别指出在整改中应该贯彻群众路线，专题鸣放时应由虚到实，真正做到政治挂帅。农村整风应该结合生产进行，要贯彻摆事实、讲道理的原则；对三类社整顿后遗留的问题，应加以检查，需补课的应补课；对一、二类社应结合生产在6月底以前整完。
    会议认为，安徽省今年农业生产能够大跃进，去年各项准备工作做得早是一个重要的原因。根据生产准备工作宜早不宜迟的经验，会议对安徽明年的生产、水利、积肥、种子、工具、耕作技术等问题作了初步研究。要求全省各地从7月以后就开始为明年积蓄肥料，现在就要为秋后小麦播种的深耕、密植做准备，为明年水稻良种作准备。
    这次会议上，省委派往浙江、江苏、湖北、河南、山东等地的参观团汇报了他们参观的经过，介绍了各兄弟省生产、水利、积肥、耕作技术、领导办法等工作上的先进经验。到会同志认真地进行了讨论研究，一致认为这些先进经验非常可贵，对安徽发展工农业生产有很大帮助，大家表示一定要学习先进，赶上先进。
    会议最后，省委第一书记曾希圣同志作了总结。他逐一解答了大家在学习党中央毛主席指示中所提出的许多理论问题和认识问题，对一些错误观点进行了批判。他特别强调要求各级党委抓政治思想工作。关于当前生产工作，他指出，必须采取各种增产措施，力争今年生产大丰收，并要求各地总结今年的经验教训，为明年生产进行思想上、物质上的各种准备。他还指出，要认真学习兄弟省的先进经验，省内也要相互观摩，相互学习，防止和克服自满情绪。最后，他号召：必须坚决贯彻“多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游”的社会主义建设路线，积极发扬共产主义风格，努力学习唯物辩证法，使我们的思想不断跃进，使我们的生产不断推向新的高潮。
