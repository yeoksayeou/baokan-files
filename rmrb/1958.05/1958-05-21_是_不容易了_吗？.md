    Is it “Not Easy Anymore”?
    He Guilin

    Since the rectification campaign, it has become a new trend for leading cadres to dismount from their horses and view the flowers, and to cultivate experimental plots. However, there has also been a reaction: "It’s not easy to be a leading cadre now."

    Revolutionary leaders were never meant to have an easy job. They are both leaders and ordinary laborers; they are both teachers and students of the masses. From this perspective, the "not easy" argument is not without merit. But the problem does not lie there, but in the two work styles and two leadership methods of the revolutionary leaders themselves.

    As a leading cadre, if one sits in the office and issues orders, it seems "easy," but in reality, it is not. Because the result of doing so is that the work is not thorough, the leadership is weak, and the masses are not satisfied. If the leaders go among the masses, dismount from their horses and view the flowers, and share the joys and sorrows of the masses, it seems "not easy," but in reality, it is easy. Because the result of doing so is that problems are discovered, the leadership is strong, and the masses support it.

  If this "not easy" argument stems from emotion, it can be said to be a good phenomenon in a certain sense. If it stems from sighing, it is a serious obstacle to changing the style of leadership.

    是“不容易了”吗？
    何桂林
    领导工作人员下马观花、种试验田等，在整风运动以来，已经形成了一种新风气。但是，也听到这样一种反映：“现在当领导干部可不容易了。”
    革命的领导者，本来就是不容易的。他既是领导者，又是普通的劳动者；既要做群众的先生，又要做群众的学生。如果从这个角度看，“不容易”论是不无道理的。但是问题并不在此，而在于革命领导者本身的两种作风和两种领导方法。
    作为领导干部，如果坐在办公室里发号施令，看来是“容易”的，但实际上却不容易。因为这样做的结果，工作不深入，领导没力量，群众不满意。如果领导到群众中去，下马观花，同群众共甘苦，看来是“不容易”的，但实际上却是容易的。因为这样做的结果，问题发现了，领导有力了，群众拥护了。
  这种“不容易”论，如果是出于感慨，在一定的意义下，倒可以说是一种好现象。如果出于叹息，就是改变领导作风的严重障碍了。
