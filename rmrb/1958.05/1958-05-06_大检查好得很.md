Editorial Notes:

    The Great Inspection is Excellent

    As can be seen from this report on the agricultural great inspection in Hubei Province, the great inspection is indeed a very good leadership method.

    Our Party has always attached importance to the inspection of work. In every region, every department, and every unit, various forms of inspection occur every year, every month, and even every day. However, large-scale inspections organized by Hubei Province and many other places are new developments in this year's inspection work. What kind of political situation, what kind of working methods. This large-scale collective inspection is precisely a method of inspection work adapted to the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Leaders of the five levels of Party and government organizations at the provincial, prefectural, county, district, and township levels, together with leaders of all departments, go deep into the masses and deep into reality. They look and talk, and once they see clearly and talk well, they immediately make up their minds to do it—correct the shortcomings that should be corrected; promote the good experiences that should be promoted. This kind of inspection is lively, unconstrained, and the effect is "immediate." Through the great inspection, the leaders educated the masses and were also educated by the masses on the spot. This is an inspection method that conforms to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. Of course, this does not mean that only great inspections are needed, and small inspections are not needed; great inspections should be advocated at certain times, and regular small inspections are also needed. Great and small inspections should be well coordinated.

### 大检查好得很

    大检查好得很
    从这篇关于湖北省农业大检查的报道中可以看出，大检查的确是一种很好的领导方法。
    我们党向来是重视对工作的检查的，在每个地区、每个部门和每个单位中，各种各样形式的检查年年有，月月有，甚至天天有，不过像湖北省和其他许多地方组织的大规模的检查，却是今年检查工作中的新发展。有什么样的政治形势，就有什么样的工作方法。现在这种大规模的集体检查，正是与农业生产大跃进的形势相适应的检查工作的方法。省、地、县、区、乡五级党政组织和所有部门的领导者一起深入群众，深入实际，一面看，一面谈，看准了，谈好了，马上就下决心做——该纠正的缺点就纠正；该推广的好经验就推广。这种检查，生动活泼，无拘无束，而效果却是“立竿见影”。通过大检查，领导者教育了群众，也当场受到了群众的教育。这是一种符合多快好省的检查方法。当然，这不是说光要大检查，就不要小检查了；一定时期的大检查要提倡，经常的小检查也需要，大、小检查要配合好。
