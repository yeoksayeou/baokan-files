How Miracles Are Created
An Introduction to the Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Pavilion at the Agricultural Tools Exhibition (Part 1)
By our reporter Gu Ye Shi

The completion of 2.7 billion cubic meters of earthwork in water conservancy projects nationwide last winter and this spring is a miracle. The Agricultural Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Pavilion showcases a large number of tools, and after visiting these advanced tools, we understand how the miracle was created.

In the eastern area of this pavilion, more than 200 pieces of earth-moving tools, tamping and rolling tools, well-drilling tools, cement substitutes, and simple wooden instruments are installed, truly like treasures from a cornucopia. These tools are almost entirely created, invented, and improved by the broad masses of farmers.

Among the flatland earth-moving vehicles, the wooden gravity roller created by the masses of Tangzhuang Township, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, has attracted attention. Using a gravity roller to transport earth allows one laborer to push 800 to 1,000 jin of earth. When unloading, simply hook the iron hook on the wooden bucket onto the iron ring on the wheel support, and the wooden bucket will rotate with the large wheel to unload automatically. The double-track trolley exhibited by Anhui Province can not only automatically unload earth but also automatically close the bottom plate. Zhejiang Province, which produces a lot of bamboo, uses raw bamboo to pave tracks for wooden-wheeled vehicles to slide on. Yunnan Province's mountainous areas have also set up elevated wooden track automatic unloading flatcars, which can pass through uneven terrain or cross rivers and ditches. The "Somersault" wooden track bulldozer and "Two Horses Running Side by Side" rapid earth-moving tools from Henan Province, as well as the wooden track earth train from Shanxi Province, have all been praised by the masses.

Walking along a newly plowed field, many aerial cables are strung between the bank of a deep ditch and the bottom, where people can see various earth-moving buckets moving up and down on the cables. This is what the masses call "flying in the sky." The hand-cranked automatic rotating earth-moving machine is a favorite among visitors. It was created by He Ting, a member of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Sunzhuang Township, Tanghe County, Henan Province. Since the opening of the exhibition, He Ting has demonstrated it countless times for visitors, and some have even requested to operate it themselves. This earth-moving machine is best suited for transporting earth upwards when digging ponds, increasing efficiency eightfold compared to manual carrying, and allowing semi-laborers to participate in the work. Some visitors have also asked He Ting to introduce the process of his creation and expressed admiration for his diligent research and tool reform spirit. The chain bucket mud delivery machine created by the masses in Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, can be used in areas with gentle slopes in the south. The bamboo slide rope earth-moving machine from Xundian Hui Autonomous County in Yunnan Province, the "Mandarin Duck" counter-bucket automatic earth-dumping machine, and the bow-shaped earth-moving machine from Henan Province are all good tools that are easy to operate, highly efficient, and low in cost.

Another arduous physical labor in water conservancy construction is compaction. Farmers have also come up with many good ways to improve the tools for ramming, pile driving, and rolling. Qujing County in Yunnan Province exhibited a foot-operated jumping automatic ramming machine, suitable for compacting small areas. The pile-driving frame created by the Xinlong Cooperative in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, can save nine laborers and increase work efficiency by twofold. Zhao Changzhi, a member of the Red Star Cooperative in Chengcun Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, created a wooden hollow sand-filled sheep's horn roller and a prism roller. Using this tool, with a soil layer of three public inches thick at a time, the sheep's horn roller is used in front, and the prism roller is used behind, rolling in tandem, which can roll three zhang wide and one and a half li long per day, increasing efficiency seventeen times compared to the original pile driving and ramming.

During large-scale water conservancy construction, the supply of cement and surveying instruments in various places is very tight, so the masses repaired while thinking of ways, successfully trial-producing many cement substitutes, and also creating and imitating many simple and practical surveying instruments, ensuring the completion of the project and guaranteeing the quality of the project. In this exhibition hall, we can see them one by one.

Two well frames are also set up in this pavilion, comparing the old and new methods of well drilling. Well drilling and spring development are one of the main measures for farmland irrigation and water use in vast pastoral areas in northern China. At present, more than 10 million irrigation wells of various types have been drilled nationwide, capable of irrigating nearly 200 million mu of farmland. Among the exhibits, there are also advanced tools for digging cylinder wells, such as mud-grabbing machines and horizontal pipe drivers, as well as various drilling tools, such as the Leap Forward Cone and filter pipes for cone well spring development. The Leap Forward Cone was created by Chen Fatian and others, well-drilling technicians from Baocheng Township, Neihuang County, Henan Province. This time, they will promote the Leap Forward Cone in Beijing, and they have already gone to the agricultural farm of the Agricultural University a few days ago to teach new well-drilling techniques. Li Hengfang, Deputy County Head of Neihuang County, and Hu Jinqiao, a well-drilling technician, have also successfully tested a reed brick spring, which is an example of the combination of mass wisdom and advanced Soviet experience. They used reed mats to replace the insufficient supply of palm fiber and brick slag to replace bricks and stones, leaving water inlets on the entire spring pipe from bottom to top, which can increase the depth of the water-bearing layer and increase the water output by five to ten times.

After seeing the exhibits in this exhibition hall, it is not difficult for us to imagine how much revolutionary enthusiasm and creative spirit the broad masses of farmers have to strive to achieve the national agricultural development program targets ahead of schedule.

    奇迹是怎样创造出来的
    农具展览会农田灌溉排水机具馆介绍之一
    本报记者　顾也是
    去冬今春全国完成水利工程土石方二百七十亿公方，这是一个奇迹。农田灌溉排水机具馆展出了大批的工具，参观了这些先进工具，我们就知道了奇迹是怎样创造的。
    在这个馆的东边场地上，安装着二百多件运土工具、夯实碾压工具、打井工具、水泥代用品和木制简便仪器等，真像聚宝盆里一宗宗的宝贝。这些工具几乎全部是广大农民群众创造发明和改良的。
    在平地运土车中，受到观众们注意的是河南省方城县唐庄乡群众创造的木制重力滚车。用重力滚车运土，一个劳动力就能推动八百斤到一千斤土；卸土时，只要把木斗上的铁钩挂住轮撑上的铁环，木斗就随着大车轮转动，自动卸土。安徽省展出的双轨滑车，车斗不但可以自动卸土，还可以自行关好底板。浙江省产竹子较多，他们用原竹铺成轨道，让木轮车滑行。云南省山区还设下了高脚木轨自动卸土平车，可以通过高低不平的地方或跨过河沟。河南省的鹞子翻身木轨推土车、二马分鬃快速运土等，山西省的木轨土火车等，都受到了群众们的赞许。
    沿着新翻过土的一片田地旁边走去，在一条深沟的岸上和沟底之间架着许多天线，人们在这里可以看到各种运土的吊斗一上一下地在天线上来往。这就是群众称道的“天上飞”。观众们最喜欢看的是手摇自动回转运土机。这是河南省唐河县孙庄乡红星农业社社员贺亭创造的。自从展览会开幕以来，贺亭已经为观众们表演过无数次了，有的人还要求亲自动动手。这种运土机最适合于挖塘时由下往上运土，比人工挑土提高效率八倍，还可以利用半劳力参加工作。有的观众还请贺亭介绍他创造的经过，并对他的刻苦钻研改革工具的精神表示钦佩。浙江省瑞安县群众创制的链斗式送泥机，在南方坡度不大的地方都可以采用。云南省寻甸回族自治县的竹溜绳运土、河南省的鸳鸯对斗自动倒土机、弓型运土机等，都是操作简便，效率高，成本低的好工具。
    水利施工中还有一项繁重的体力劳动，就是压实。农民们也想出许多好办法改进了打夯、打硪和碾压的工具。云南省曲靖县展出了一部脚踏跳式自动打夯机，适合于小面积的夯压。湖北省当阳县新龙社创制的打硪架，可以节省九个劳动力，提高工作效率二倍。河南省鲁山县程村乡红星社社员赵长治创造了木制空心灌沙羊角碾和棱子磙，利用这种工具，在一次上土三公寸厚的情况下，前面用羊角碾，后面用棱子磙，套着碾压，每天可碾压三丈宽一里半长，较原来打硪夯压提高效率十七倍。
    在大规模兴修水利工程中，各地水泥和测量仪器的供应都十分紧张，群众就一边修，一边想办法，试制成功了不少水泥代用品，还创造和仿制了不少简便实用的测量仪器，保证了工程的完成，也保证了工程的质量。在这个展览馆里，我们可以一一看到。
    在这个馆里还搭着两个井架，比较了新旧打井的方法。打井下泉工作是我国北方农田灌溉和广大牧区用水的主要措施之一。现在全国已打有各种灌溉用水井一千多万眼，能灌溉近两亿亩农田。展出的实物中，还有抓泥机、打横管等挖筒井的先进工具，以及各种钻探工具，锥井下泉用的跃进锥、滤水管等。跃进锥是河南省内黄县亳城乡井泉技师陈法田等人创造的。这次他们要在北京推广跃进锥，前几天已到农业大学农场传授新法打井技术。内黄县副县长李恒方、井泉技师胡金桥等人还试验成功了一种苇砖泉，是群众智慧和苏联先进经验相结合的一个范例。他们用苇篾代替供应不足的棕片，用砖渣等代替砖石，把泉管由底到顶全部留上进水眼，能增加进水层深度，可以提高出水量五倍到十倍。
    把这个展览馆的展品看完后，我们就不难想像广大农民群众为争取提前达到全国农业发展纲要指标具有多么大的革命干劲和创造精神。
