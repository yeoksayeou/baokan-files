Xinhua News Agency, London, May 4th: The British Communist Party organized this afternoon in London a May Day demonstration and parade that was the largest and most spirited in many years. The five-thousand-strong procession was led by Harry Pollitt, Chairman of the British Communist Party, and John Gollan, General Secretary. They held aloft red flags and placards with slogans such as: "Hold a summit conference immediately!" "Stop nuclear tests!" "Living Wages Now!" "If you don't want to be fired, vote the Tories out!"

After the march, a mass rally was held in Hyde Park. Gollan spoke at the rally. He denounced Western governments for obstructing the convening of a summit conference. He said, "There should be no further delays; a summit conference should be held immediately. If the United States does not do so, then Britain should cast aside the United States and do so herself."

Regarding the struggle of the British working class, Gollan emphasized that Britain is now entering "the most critical stage of industrial conditions since 1926." He said, "The fact is that we are facing the biggest joint offensive launched by capital, nationalized industries, and the government." Gollan called for support for the bus workers who are about to strike for higher wages.

The assembly passed a resolution demanding that "all who desire peace strengthen pressure on the government in order to ensure the holding of a summit conference, the banning of nuclear weapons, and the achievement of collective security." The resolution also called on the entire labor movement to continue its efforts to end Conservative rule.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th: London bus workers began their strike at midnight on the 4th, as scheduled. On the morning of the 5th, all eight thousand four hundred buses, trolley buses, and long-distance buses in London had come to a complete standstill. This is the first major strike by London bus workers since 1937.

This strike, involving fifty thousand people (previously mistakenly reported as five hundred thousand), was triggered by the British government-owned London Transport Company's rejection of the workers' demands for higher wages. The strike has received the support of many British trade unions.

    反对再拖延最高级会议
    英劳动人民大示威
    据新华社伦敦4日电　英国共产党今天下午在伦敦组织了一次多年来规模最大和气势最壮的五一节示威游行。五千人的游行队伍由英国共产党主席波立特和总书记高兰率领。他们高举着红旗和标语牌，上面写着：“立即举行最高级会议！”“停止核试验！”“要有能够维持生活的工资！”“如果你不愿意被人解雇，那就要保守党下台！”
    游行后在海德公园举行了群众大会。高兰在大会上讲了话。他斥责西方国家政府阻挠召开最高级会议。他说，“不要再拖延了，应该立即举行最高级会议。如果美国不这样做，那么英国就应该抛开美国，自己这样做。”
    关于英国工人阶级的斗争，高兰强调指出：英国现在正进入“1926年以来工业状况最危急的阶段”。他说：“事实是，我们面临着资方、国有化工业和政府发动的最大的联合攻势。”高兰要求支持即将举行罢工要求增加工资的公共汽车工人。
    大会通过一项决议，要求“所有希望和平的人加强对政府的压力，以便确保最高级会议的举行，禁止核武器和实现集体安全”。决议还呼吁整个劳工运动继续努力争取结束保守党的统治。
    据新华社伦敦5日电　伦敦公共汽车工人按照预定日期在4日午夜开始罢工。5日清晨，伦敦八千四百辆公共汽车、无轨电车和长途汽车已经全部停驶。这是1937年以来伦敦公共汽车工人第一次举行的大罢工。
    这次有五万人（前误为五十万人）参加的罢工是由于英国政府所有的伦敦运输公司拒绝了工人提高工资的要求而引起的。罢工得到了英国许多工会的支持。
