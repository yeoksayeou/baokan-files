Dare to Think, Dare to Do
Hangzhou First Hospital Nurses Reform Bed-Making Method

　　This newspaper reports that, in the Two-Anti movement, nurses at Hangzhou First Municipal Hospital broke with convention and proposed eliminating the use of outer bedspreads and fitted sheets for bed-making. This proposal drew the attention of the hospital's Party and administrative leaders. After being implemented on all 250 beds in the hospital in March, over 750 bedsheets were saved in terms of usage and circulation. Previously, it required two nurses to make a bed together, but now one person can do it. Patients reflected: now it's clean, neat, and feels more like home. This is what it means to think of the patients.

　　Currently, the bedding materials and styles used in urban hospitals have been around for over a hundred years in foreign countries, and the system has been in place in Chinese hospitals for over seventy years. The purpose is to make patients comfortable and the wards clean and beautiful. However, because this bed-making method is not suited to the living habits of the Chinese people, it often defeats its purpose. Because of the bedspread and two layers of sheets, lightly ill patients often mess up the sheets when sitting up or lying down. Patients who do not understand how to fold them find it troublesome to tidy them up, and often simply push the two layers of sheets to one side and cover themselves with the bedspread (which is not washed and changed frequently). Seriously ill patients cannot move, and the two layers of sheets bunch up and slide down, looking messy and feeling uncomfortable. In order to maintain the tidiness and beauty of the ward, nurses wake the patients up early every morning to make the beds. Patients cannot rest well and angrily criticize: making the beds is for the benefit of the doctors who inspect the wards; the style is for "imported goods." Nurses also feel that it takes time and effort for two people to make one bed. But in the past, they never dared to propose reforms directly. Han Wenwen, the head nurse of internal medicine who first proposed the reform, said: because this was passed down from abroad, what we learned in nursing school, what we do in the hospital, is all like this. In our work, we made some simplifications for the convenience of patients, but at the time we were criticized. She said that the benefits of this reform are many: first, it saves the country cotton cloth; second, it reduces the chances of patients coming into contact with infections because the bedspreads are changed and washed directly; and third, it improves work efficiency, enables patient cooperation, and makes it easier to manage the tidiness of the beds.

　　Now, the hospital is further studying and improving the original style of the bedspreads to make them easier to wash and more beautiful after the modifications. (Tu Zhengfeng)

### 大胆的想　大胆的干  杭州第一医院护士改革铺床方法

　　大胆的想　大胆的干
　　杭州第一医院护士改革铺床方法
    本报讯　在双反运动中杭州市立第一医院护士打破陈规，提出了取消病床被套子外加罩、衬床单铺床的建议，引起了该院党政领导的重视。3月份在全院二百五十张病床上推广后，已省下了使用和周转的床单七百五十多条；原来需要两个护士同时铺床的，现在一人已能操作；病人反映：现在干净、利落、家庭化。这才叫为病人着想。
    目前，在城市医院中铺床的用物和式样，在国外已有一百多年的历史，在我国医院形成制度也有七十多年。其目的是使病人舒适，病房整洁美观。但由于这种铺床法不适合我国人民的生活习惯，往往事与愿违。由于被套子外加上两层床单，轻病人因睡下坐起常翻乱床单。病人不懂它的折法，想整理一下，也感到麻烦，常常干脆把这两层床单推在一边，把被套盖在身上（被套不常换洗）。重病人挪不动，这两层床单缩上滑下，长的短的显得很乱，盖着也很不舒服。护士为了保持病房整齐美观，每天早晨她们很早就把病人叫醒整理床铺。病人不能好好休息，恼火地批评：铺床是为查病房的医师服务；式样是为“进口货”服务。护士也觉得要两个人铺一张床，费时又费力。但过去，他们始终不敢正面提出改革。这次首先提出改革的内科护士长韩纹纹说：因为这是国外传来的，我们在护士学校学的，到医院里来做的，都是这样。在工作中，为了病人方便，曾作了一些简化，但当时我们受到了批评。她说，这样改革的好处很多，一是节省国家棉布，二是因直接换洗被套子，减少了病人接触传染的机会，三是提高了工作效率，能取得病人的协作，病床的整齐也易于管理。
    现在该院正进一步研究和改良原有被套子的式样，使它改制以后便于换洗和更加美观。（屠正峰）
