    A Tragic Page in the History of Revolutionary Struggle
    ——A Review of the Drama "Red Storm"
　  Zhang Ying
    Recently, the drama "Red Storm," collectively created by the China Youth Art Theater, written and directed by Jin Shan, and performed with the "February 7th" Workers' Strike as its subject matter, is a good play worthy of recommendation.
    More than thirty years ago, China was in a state of warlord melee, and the people were living in dire straits. The emerging Chinese working class lived an extremely miserable life under the cruel exploitation of imperialism, feudal rule, and capitalists, but they also began to develop a staunch and unyielding fighting character. After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, it quickly combined with the resistance struggles of the working class, bringing the working class to the stage of political struggle and changing the face of Chinese history. The "February 7th" Beijing-Hankou Railway Workers' Strike in 1923 was precisely a moving prelude to the Chinese working class's participation in political struggle. Although this strike temporarily failed due to the cruel suppression by the ruling class, the outstanding sons and daughters of the working class—the leaders of this page of struggle history, such as martyrs Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang—displayed a magnificent spirit and staunch unyielding fighting spirit, which indeed made the enemy tremble and inspired the people's strength to move forward.
    "Red Storm" is a drama that positively depicts the revolutionary history of the "February 7th" Workers' Strike. Therefore, people have reason to demand that it can truly and accurately reflect the whole picture of this history. It should be said that "Red Storm" has achieved this. In just a few hours, the audience revisited this revolutionary history; saw the complexity, acuteness, and cruelty of this class struggle, as well as the huge price paid by the working class in the revolutionary struggle and their heroism, and received a profound education from it.
    The event that runs through the whole play is that the working class wants to establish its own trade union to fight for human rights and freedom, while the rulers try every means to obstruct and sabotage it. Through this historical event, the author exposed the contradictions and conflicts between the rulers and the working class from all aspects, allowing the acute class struggle scenes to tightly attract the audience. At the beginning of the play, people saw a picture of the miserable life of railway workers: Jiang Youcai's wife, holding a seriously ill baby, not only had no money for treatment, but also had to worry about being fired by the boss and intimidated by the lackeys. However, the enlightened worker Lin Xiangqian's family showed him deep class love and sympathy. In this scene, the author focused on writing about the complex situation on the eve of an intense class struggle that was brewing at that time: on the one hand, there was a conflict between hostile classes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Lin Xiangqian was uniting workers to establish their own trade union, while the rulers were sowing discord among the workers and using "training centers" to split the workers. On the other hand, there was a contradiction between the advanced and backward elements within the working class. Jiang Youcai and Huang Defa still had gang suspicions about Lin Xiangqian. Especially in the second scene, Wei Xueqing, the chief of the Jinghan Railway Bureau's police department, took advantage of the incident of his father being hit by a train to publicly incite hatred among the masses between Hubei workers and Fujian workers; Lin Xiangqian cleverly used the enemy's set-up to expose the enemy's conspiracy. The author used such reasonable and dramatic plots to reflect the regularity of the development of the workers' movement from spontaneity to consciousness; and quickly concentrated the dramatic conflict on the acute class struggle, making this scene both have tense fighting scenes and have a certain ideological significance. But the first act is not without its shortcomings. The author seems to have overdone the depiction of the gang contradictions among the workers and the rulers' use of this contradiction; this easily makes people feel that the contradiction between the working class and the rulers is not strong and clear enough. In addition, the author's use of selected and prominent writing is certainly a strength, but from the first act, the specific descriptions of characters and events seem to be insufficiently rich.
    The second scene of the second act is the scene of the founding meeting of the Jinghan Railway General Trade Union at the Pule Theater in Zhengzhou. The author boldly put this most acute historical fact on the stage in a positive way. Generally speaking, it is more difficult to show scenes of holding a big meeting on the stage; however, from the requirements of the entire play, this scene is very important. Because, if this great mass struggle scene is not shown, it will make this magnificent struggle history lose its brilliance, and it is also difficult to reflect the whole picture of this history. This scene written in "Red Storm" is quite brilliant. At the beginning, the author described some dramatic details; the contradictions between the police and the army of the warlord rule; the appearance of the representative figures of the ruling class, Bai Jianwu and Zhao Jixian, as if they were facing a formidable enemy but were helpless; this not only enlivened the stage atmosphere, but also showed the real situation of the struggle at that time. Although the power of the rulers was strong, they used military police to surround the venue, trying to use force to stop the just actions of the working class; but they were frightened in front of the working class. And the enlightened working class, although unarmed, was fearless. At the same time, the author put the representative figures of the two opposing sides at the forefront of the contradiction. Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang argued with Bai Jianwu on the front, but failed, so they took action. Through these descriptions, the bravery and wit of heroic figures such as Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang are shown. Finally, the worker representatives rushed into the venue and announced the establishment of the General Trade Union. At this time, a magnificent picture was formed on the stage: the working class defeated the rulers in the political struggle for the first time with its own strength, and red flags fluttered in front of the Pule Theater; the voices of Shi Yang, the representative of the Party and the working class, stirred, making the audience seem to enter such a great struggle ranks, feeling the unparalleled power of the working class.
    There are two scenes in the play that completely describe the scenes of the ruling class: scene one and three of the second act are in the mansion of Bai Jianwu, Wu Peifu's advisor, and in the British consulate. These two scenes very concisely and centrally reflect the struggle situation at that time from another side. The author focused on depicting the main representative of the ruling class, Bai Jianwu, this so-called "surpassing Zhuge Liang" type of character. On the one hand, he was insidious and vicious and full of tricks in dealing with the working class; the scene of buying over the traitor Liang Chengwu prominently showed this side of his character; however, in front of the British and American imperialists, he was completely another face of dependence and reliance. They were precisely taking the lives and property of the people to exchange for the favor of imperialism, and relying on the power of imperialism to exploit the people. This is the true portrayal of the ruling class in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. I think it is completely necessary to make such a more specific and detailed description of Bai Jianwu and the imperialists in the play. Because only by seeing the treacherousness and viciousness of the enemy can we highlight the justice of the working class's struggle and the difficulty and value of obtaining victory, and can the audience more deeply see the significance of this struggle from many aspects.
    From the dramatic scenes selected and described by the author, we can see that the author has correctly grasped this complex history of class struggle. And he adopted very refined and concentrated artistic expression techniques, highlighting and describing several important scenes with ideological significance. From the description of these prominent scenes, he showed considerable ideological depth, and the art also formed a more complete and unified style.
    After watching "Red Storm," people are also deeply moved by the heroic figures in history. Here, let's first talk about Shi Yang. People who know a little about the history of modern revolutionary movements are familiar with Lin Xiangqian, the leader of the workers in the "February 7th" strike, but are relatively unfamiliar with Shi Yang. In "Red Storm," the author focuses on portraying this character not without reason. Shi Yang was an excellent Communist Party member who not only made great contributions to the vigorous workers' movement in Wuhan at that time, but also gloriously sacrificed under the warlord's butcher knife after "February 7th." He is indeed a martyr worthy of commemoration. From his life of struggle, we can see the path taken by a revolutionary intellectual; in his early years, in order to save the country and the people, he pursued various kinds of knowledge, engaged in various occupations, and participated in different struggles, experiencing all kinds of difficulties, but it can be said that he achieved nothing. It was not until after the "May Fourth" Movement, influenced by the victory of the Russian Revolution, and accepted communist ideas, that he joined the revolutionary ranks of the working class and dedicated his life to the cause of communism. From him, we can also see the situation in the early days of the Party's establishment, when revolutionary intellectuals with communist ideas combined with the workers' movement. In the play, Shi Yang already appears as a leader of the workers' movement and an excellent Communist Party member. The author sings praises for this character with great passion, treating him as a representative of the Party and the truth, which is what should be done. In portraying this character, as with the handling of other dramatic scenes, the author grasped the important core and made a prominent description. Shi Yang appeared every time when the revolutionary struggle encountered difficulties or when the struggle was the most cruel and acute. He did not have many scenes, but he left a deep impression on the audience. This is because the author, on the one hand, grasped the character characteristics of a eloquent lawyer, but more importantly, the author left enough foreshadowing for this character in the development of the whole play. Therefore, although he did not appear on the stage during the struggle, in the audience's emotions, he never left the ongoing struggle, so when the drama develops to an important juncture, the audience will naturally arouse suspense about him. As long as he appears, it will arouse strong feelings in people, creating a climax in each scene. And his long speeches also seem to be the inevitable result of the development of the drama, deeply moving people without feeling boring at all. The reason why this character can be so vividly presented on the stage is of course inseparable from Jin Shan's outstanding performance art. He completely grasped the inner thoughts and feelings of the character and the description of the character in the drama; through his refined and accurate stage movements and language with a strong sense of rhythm, he made this character live on the stage and live in the audience's memory.
    Another important figure in the drama, Lin Xiangqian, is an enlightened pioneer in the working class, a hero tempered in mass struggles. He and Shi Yang are two very different figures. The author specifically and meticulously depicts his deep class feelings and his confidence in the revolutionary cause. He took off his only shabby clothes to exchange medicine for a poor and sick worker, and even when his own family was hungry, he still helped those comrades who were more difficult than him. After the strike was met with armed suppression, he also showed optimism and confidence in the power of the working class. Therefore, his comrades respected him and trusted him so much, and his spirit of calmly facing death and never surrendering more prominently showed the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. In the play, he did not appear as a heroic figure, but the audience could not help but be moved by his heroic deeds. Yu Cun's portrayal of Lin Xiangqian is also successful. Yu Cun did not try to highlight this character, but let him naturally live in the masses and struggle, making the audience believe in him and love him. I think Yu Cun has indeed taken a significant step in this play, breaking through some of the bad influences left over after he created such a vivid image as Li Wancheng (the protagonist in "Looking West to Chang'an"), and creating another brand-new stage image.
    Around the character of Lin Xiangqian, the author also described Lin Xiangqian's father, an old worker with revolutionary blood, and Chen Guizhen, who was infected by Lin Xiangqian and his son and had deep class feelings. This is a revolutionary family that people admire, and the audience can fully believe that the author's idea that Lin Xiangqian's family should be like this. Perhaps such a description does not completely conform to the reality of life, but the author made such a treatment in order to enrich the spiritual outlook of this heroic figure and to concentrate his efforts on writing about the struggle between hostile classes, I think it does not detract from the truth of art.
    The stage design of "Red Storm" is also worth mentioning. When we are used to seeing stages with colorful and magnificent furnishings, we will naturally have a feeling of joy when we see such a simple and unadorned and realistic stage surface. I think this is a style worth promoting in stage art.
    There are too few dramas reflecting the revolutionary history of our Party and the working class. "Red Storm" can be said to be a good start. We look forward to playwrights writing more historical dramas reflecting the revolutionary struggle in the great leap forward of the people across the country.

    革命斗争史的悲壮一页
    ——评话剧“红色风暴”
　  张颖
    最近，中国青年艺术剧院集体创作、金山编导、演出的以“二七”工人大罢工为题材的话剧“红色风暴”，是一出值得推荐的好戏。
    三十多年前的中国，正处在军阀混战，民不聊生的境地。新兴的中国工人阶级在帝国主义、封建统治和资本家的残酷剥削下，过着极其悲惨的生活，但也开始锻炼成为坚强不屈的斗争性格。1921年中国共产党成立后，很快就和工人阶级的反抗斗争结合起来，把工人阶级带上了政治斗争的舞台，改变了中国历史的面貌。1923年发生的“二七”京汉铁路工人大罢工，就正是中国工人阶级参加政治斗争动人心魄的序曲。虽然，这次大罢工由于统治阶级的残酷镇压而暂时失败了，但工人阶级的优秀儿女——这一页斗争历史的领导者林祥谦和施洋等烈士所表现出的宏伟气魄和坚强不屈的斗争精神，确曾使敌人胆寒，并鼓舞了人民前进的力量。
    “红色风暴”是正面描写“二七”工人大罢工革命历史的一部戏剧，因此人们就有理由要求它能够真实而又准确地反映这段历史的全貌。应该说，“红色风暴”是做到了这点的。观众在短短的几小时内，重温了这段革命史；看到了这场阶级斗争的复杂、尖锐和残酷，以及工人阶级在革命斗争中所付出的巨大代价和他们的英雄气概，并从中受到了深刻的教育。
    贯串全剧的事件是工人阶级为了争人权争自由，要成立自己的工会，而统治者则千方百计地阻挠、破坏。作者通过这一历史事件，从各方面揭露了统治者和工人阶级之间的矛盾冲突，让尖锐的阶级斗争场面，紧紧地吸引住观众。戏一开始，人们便看到铁路工人悲惨生活的图景：江有才的妻子抱着重病的婴儿，不但没有钱治，赚的钱不能糊口的位子还得时刻担心老板的开除和狗腿子的威逼利诱。可是，觉悟了的工人林祥谦一家却对他表示了深厚的阶级友爱与同情。在这一场戏里，作者集中地写出了当时正在酝酿着的一场剧烈的阶级斗争前夜的复杂情景：一方面是敌对阶级之间的冲突，在共产党的领导下，林祥谦正在团结工友们成立自己的工会，而统治者却在工人当中进行挑拨，用“传习所”来分裂工人。另一方面是工人阶级之间先进与落后的矛盾，江有才、黄得发对林祥谦还存在帮派的猜疑。特别是第二场，京汉铁路局警备处长魏学清借着他父亲被火车撞死的事件，想公开地在群众中挑起湖北工人对福建工人的仇视；林祥谦却很巧妙地利用了敌人布置好的圈套，揭露了敌人的阴谋。作者用了这样合情合理而又富有戏剧性的情节，反映了工人运动发展过程中从自发到自觉的规律性；并又迅速地把戏剧冲突集中在尖锐的阶级斗争上，使这幕戏既有紧张的斗争场面，也有一定的思想性。但第一幕戏并不是没有缺点的。作者对工人之间的帮派矛盾以及统治者利用这一矛盾似乎描写得过分了些；这样容易使人感到工人阶级和统治者之间的矛盾不够强烈和鲜明了。另外，作者所用的精选突出的写法固然是长处，但从第一幕来看对人物事件的具体描写都显得不够丰富。
    第二幕第二场是京汉铁路总工会在郑州普乐戏园开成立大会的场面。作者把斗争最尖锐的这一段史实，正面地放在舞台上，真是很大胆的作法。一般来说，在舞台上表现开大会这样的场面是比较困难的；然而从整个戏的要求来说，这场戏却非常重要。因为，如果不把这一伟大的群众斗争场面表现出来，那就会使这一场轰轰烈烈的斗争历史失去光采，也很难反映这一历史的全貌。“红色风暴”中所写的这一场戏是相当精采的，开始，作者便描写了一些富有戏剧性的细节；军阀统治的警察和军队间的矛盾；统治阶级的代表人物白坚武、赵继贤那种如临大敌又束手无策的样子；这样既活跃了舞台气氛，也表现出当时斗争的真实情景。虽然，统治者的力量是强大的，他们用军警包围了会场，想以武力来阻止工人阶级的正义行动；但他们在工人阶级面前却心惊胆战。而觉悟了的工人阶级虽是赤手空拳，却无所畏惧。同时，作者把敌对两面的代表人物都摆在矛盾尖端上，林祥谦和施洋正面和白坚武说理不成，就行动起来。通过这些描写，表现出林祥谦和施洋等英雄人物的勇敢机智。最后，工人代表们冲进了会场，宣布总工会成立。这时，在舞台上便形成了一幅气势雄伟的画面：工人阶级第一次以自己的力量在政治斗争上击败了统治者，普乐戏园门前红旗招展；党和工人阶级的代表施洋的声音激荡着，使观众好像也进入了那样伟大的斗争行列中，感受到工人阶级的无比力量。
    戏中有两场完全是描写统治阶级的场面的：二幕一场和三场在吴佩孚的顾问白坚武的公馆和英国领事馆里。这两场戏非常精练集中地从另一个侧面来反映当时的斗争情景，作者集中地描写了统治阶级的主要代表者白坚武这个所谓“赛诸葛”式的人物。他一面是对待工人阶级阴险毒辣，诡计多端；收买叛徒梁成武那场戏正突出地表现了他性格的这一面；可是，在英美帝国主义者的面前，他又完全是另一副依赖投靠的面孔。他们正是拿着人民的生命财产去换取帝国主义的垂青，又依靠帝国主义的力量来压榨人民。这正是半封建半殖民地社会中统治阶级的真实写照。作者正面突出地点明了英美帝国主义事实上是主持军阀屠杀中国人民的罪魁。剧中对白坚武这个人物和帝国主义者作这样比较具体细致的描写，我觉得是完全必要的。因为只有看到了敌人的奸险恶毒，才能衬托出工人阶级斗争的正义性和获得胜利的艰难与可贵，也才能让观众更深刻地从多方面看到这场斗争的意义。
    从作者选择描写的这些戏剧场面中，我们能看到作者是正确地掌握了这一段复杂的阶级斗争历史的。而他又采用了非常冼炼而集中的艺术表现手法，突出描写了几个富有思想性的重要场面，从这些突出场面的描写中，表现了相当的思想深度，艺术上也形成了比较完整统一的风格。
    人们看完“红色风暴”以后，也被历史中的英雄人物深深感动。这里，首先谈谈施洋。我们知道一点近代革命运动史的人，对“二七”大罢工中的工人领袖林祥谦都是熟悉的，但对施洋却比较陌生。“红色风暴”里，作者着重刻划了这个人物不是没有理由的。施洋是一个优秀的共产党员，不仅对当时武汉轰轰烈烈的工人运动有过很大贡献，“二七”以后，他光荣地牺牲在军阀的屠刀下，正是值得人们纪念的一位烈士。从他奋斗的一生，我们能看到一个革命知识分子所走的道路；他早年为了救国救民曾追求过种种学问，从事过各种职业和参加过不同的斗争，历尽了艰难，但可以说一事无成。直到“五四”运动以后，受到俄国革命胜利的影响，接受了共产主义思想，才投身到工人阶级革命队伍中来，为共产主义事业献出自己的一生。从他的身上，我们也看到了党成立的初期，有共产主义思想的革命知识分子和工人运动相结合的情况。在戏里，施洋一出现就已经是工人运动的领导者、优秀的共产党员，作者以极大的激情歌颂了这个人物，把他当作党和真理的代表者，这是应该的。在描写这个人物的时候，也和处理其他的戏剧场面一样，作者抓住重要的核心作了突出的描写，施洋每次出场都是在革命斗争遇到困难，或是斗争最残酷尖锐的时候。他的戏并不多，但却给观众留下了深刻的印象。这是由于作者一面抓住了作为一个能言善辩律师的性格特征，更主要的是作者在全剧的发展中，处处给这个人物留下了足够的伏笔，因此虽然在斗争的进行中，他并没有在舞台上出现，但在观众的感情里，他却始终没有离开正在进行的斗争，所以戏剧发展到重要关头，观众就自然引起对他的悬念，只要他一出场就引起人们强烈的感受，造成每场戏的高潮。而他那些长段的讲演，也显得是戏剧发展的必然结果，深深地激动人心丝毫不觉得枯燥。这个人物之所以能如此活现在舞台上，当然是和金山特出的表演艺术分不开的，他完全掌握了人物内在的思想感情，和戏剧中对这个人物的塑造描写；通过他精炼而准确的舞台动作，有强烈节奏感的语言，使这个人物活在舞台上，活在观众的记忆中。
    戏剧中另一个重要人物林祥谦是工人阶级中觉悟的先行者，是群众斗争中锻炼出来的英雄，他和施洋是两个迥然不同的人物。作者具体细致地描绘了他深厚的阶级感情，和对革命事业的信心。他把身上仅有的破衣裳脱下来给贫病交迫的工友换药，自己一家子饿着还要帮助那些比他更困难的同志，当罢工遭到武力镇压以后，他还表现出乐观主义的精神和对工人阶级力量的自信。因此工友们那样敬重他信赖他，最后他从容就义宁死不屈的精神就更突出地表现了一个共产党员的崇高品质。在戏中，他并没有以英雄人物的姿态出现，但观众却不能不被他的英雄事迹所激动。于村扮演的林祥谦也是成功的。于村没有去突出这个人物，而是让他自然地生活在群众和斗争中，使观众相信他爱戴他。我觉得于村在这个戏里确是显著地跨进了一步，突破了他创造出栗晚成（“西望长安”中的主角）那样一个鲜明形象以后所遗留下的某些不良影响，而创造了另一个崭新的舞台形象。
    围绕着林祥谦这个人物，作者还描写了林祥谦的父亲，一个有革命血统的老工人，和受到林祥谦父子的感染而有深厚阶级感情的陈桂贞。这是一个使人敬仰的革命家庭，观众完全能够相信作者这样的设想，林祥谦的家就应该是这样的。也许这样的描写并不完全符合生活真实，但作者为了丰富这个英雄人物的精神面貌，为了更集中笔力去写敌对阶级之间的斗争，而作这样的处理，我想是无损于艺术的真实的。
    “红色风暴”演出的舞台装置也很值得一提，当我们看惯了陈设得五光十色、富丽堂皇的舞台以后，看到如此简洁朴素，而又富有真实感的舞台面时，会自然地产生一种喜悦的感情。我觉得在舞台美术中，这是值得提倡的一格。
    反映我们党和工人阶级革命史的戏剧太少了，“红色风暴”可以说是良好的开端。我们盼望着在全国人民大跃进的巨浪中，剧作家们将写出更多反映革命斗争的史剧。
