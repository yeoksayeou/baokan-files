Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee, I will now explain the second revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 to the assembly:

(I)

The National Agricultural Development Program was put forward during the upsurge of rural socialism in the winter of 1955. In January 1956, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee approved and promulgated the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, which directly promoted the high tide of agricultural production and greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, the national irrigated area was expanded by 130 million mu, and more than 50 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated. In 1956, the country suffered considerable natural disasters, but the total national grain output increased by 15 billion jin compared with the good year of 1955. In some provinces with better natural conditions, the total output of grain, cotton, and oil in 1956 increased by more than 10% compared with 1955, and in some counties, the total output of grain, cotton, and oil in that year increased by several tens of percent compared with 1955.

However, in the second half of 1956 and the spring of 1957, under the atmosphere of opposing so-called "rash advance," the general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the policy of adopting a promoting attitude towards construction, the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program were doubted by some people. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was damaged, affecting the progress on the production and construction front, especially the agricultural front, in 1957. From the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957, the irrigated area was only expanded by more than 36 million mu, and the total amount of fertilizer accumulated decreased to more than 40 billion dan; the national grain sown area in 1957 decreased by 55 million mu compared with 1956. In areas that still adhered to the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, agricultural production in 1957 achieved significant progress, and a number of advanced units with high yields and abundant harvests emerged. These facts are a powerful weapon for breaking down right-leaning conservative ideas in agricultural production development.

At the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee in September 1957, the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was reaffirmed. Subsequently, the Party Central Committee re-promulgated the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program. These correct instructions of the Party Central Committee, combined with the mass enthusiasm created by the anti-rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement, once again generated a new high tide in agricultural production on a larger scale since last winter. Some comrades who had doubts about the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program have learned lessons from this reversal, while others are still waiting to settle accounts in the autumn. Let them wait; anyway, they will lose. Under the inspiration of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and through the nationwide rectification movement of the whole party and the whole people, the whole party has greatly liberated its thinking and greatly changed its work style, and a communist ideological liberation movement has been launched among the people of the whole country. The great people are not only using their hands but also their brains, exerting endless wisdom and strength, breaking down the obstacles of right-leaning conservatism, and creating unprecedented miracles in the cause of socialist construction.

From October last year to the end of April this year, a great leap forward situation has emerged on the agricultural production front. According to the calculated benefit area of the national water conservancy project construction, the irrigated area can be expanded by 350 million mu, the improved irrigated area can reach 140 million mu, more than 200 million mu of low-lying and easily flooded cultivated land has been managed, more than 100 million mu of barren cultivated land has been transformed, 290 million mu of afforestation has been carried out, and the area of soil erosion controlled is 160,000 square kilometers. 310 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated, five times more than the 1956 amount during the first high tide. Although mainly consisting of local and mud fertilizers, the fertilizer effectiveness has also increased by more than two times. The national grain sown area is expected to increase by 80 million mu compared with 1957.

At the same time, a mass movement to improve farm tools has been launched in rural areas across the country. The variety of farm tools, processing tools, and transportation tools created and improved by farmers is innumerable. More than 3,000 kinds have been selected by various provinces for the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition. This mass movement to improve farm tools is the bud of a great technological revolution in rural areas. With the development of industry, semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural cultivation will be gradually realized.

At present, summer crops are growing well in various places, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Rapeseed in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi has already been harvested, and it is estimated that the rapeseed production in these three provinces will double compared with 1957. Generally speaking, the harvest of summer crops is relatively stable, and the potential for increased production is also very large. Grasping the summer harvest and increasing the proportion of summer crops in the annual harvest is an important link in striving for a great agricultural harvest. This point has already attracted the attention of various places. It is estimated that the total output of summer crops this year may increase by about 20 billion jin compared with 1957.

According to the plans of various provinces, the national rice sown area this year will increase by more than 110 million mu compared with 1957, including 67 million mu of dry land converted to paddy fields and 44 million mu of single-season converted to double-season; the sown area of ​​root crops will increase by 64 million mu compared with last year; corn will increase by 23 million mu compared with last year. The increase in the sown area of ​​high-yield crops and the relatively widespread adoption of close planting are reliable conditions for increasing grain output this year. In addition, the sowing work of 90 million mu of cotton has been basically completed, the area of ​​irrigated cotton fields has increased by 20 million mu compared with 1957, and 17 million mu of cotton fields have been converted to using the Dai-character cotton improved variety.

Judging from the growth of summer crops and the actual results of harvests in some areas, judging from the progress of spring plowing, judging from the above-mentioned achievements in water conservancy, fertilizer, improved farm tools, soil improvement, and other yield-increasing measures, and judging from the preparation of materials such as pesticides and agricultural machinery for the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, the conditions this year are not only incomparable to 1957, but also greatly exceed the first high tide in 1956. If we do not encounter major floods and droughts this year, there will be a relatively large increase in agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil. For example, the proportion of national grain increase may reach more than 10% to 20%.

The above situation shows that since the winter of 1955, the agricultural production and construction of these three winters and springs and three years have shown a saddle-shaped process with high ends and a low middle. This reversal is a bad thing, but also a good thing. It vividly educated the cadres and the people, enabling people to compare and thus understand more clearly that it is necessary to resolutely implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and to work hard to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program. The National Agricultural Development Program is a specific program for this general line in agricultural production and rural socialist construction.

(II)

Since the beginning of the new high tide of agriculture in the winter of 1957, all provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), special districts, counties, townships, and societies across the country have put forward plans to achieve and overfulfill the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. According to the plans of various provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions), there are hundreds of counties (cities) across the country that plan to reach a grain yield of 400 jin, 500 jin, or 800 jin per mu, or a cotton yield of 100 jin per mu, respectively this year. Many units also proposed slogans such as achieving "water conservancy," "mechanization," "greening," and "four-without" ahead of schedule. According to the preliminary results of the investigation in various places, most of the counties (cities) that plan to achieve the "four, five, eight" grain yield per mu and the counties (cities) that plan to achieve 100 jin of cotton per mu have a better work foundation, the indicators have penetrated deeply into the masses, the measures are relatively practical, and they have already taken serious action. However, there are also a few counties (cities) where the indicators are advanced, but they have not yet truly penetrated into the production teams and members, the measures lag behind the indicators, and the actions lag behind the measures. There are even units where the indicators are not advanced enough. We must seize the opportunity and overcome these weak links.

At present, the production increase targets proposed by various places are generally positive, and the problem lies in effectively grasping specific measures. The annual evaluation, looking at the actual production increase results, is a test. We must pay attention to preventing shallowness without depth, roughness without detail, and superficiality without substance, so as not to fail to meet the target requirements in the autumn. The production increase targets proposed by some units seem very high and seem difficult to achieve, but judging from the measures they have proposed, there is a certain basis for achieving the targets, and they are indeed seriously working there in a down-to-earth manner, and they are not superficial. But in either case, we must consider the possibility of unfavorable factors in objective conditions, such as the occurrence of uncontrollable natural disasters, or the failure of certain measures due to the lack of objective conditions. Calculating this possibility in advance can give cadres and the masses the necessary mental preparation, so that they can still maintain vigorous enthusiasm under unfavorable conditions. In short, we must implement Chairman Mao's instructions: both go all out and leave room for maneuver.

In the issues of "four-without," "greening," "mechanization," and "water conservancy," we must also pay attention to being practical and preventing false reports and exaggeration. In these areas, we have already made tremendous achievements. But these achievements still need to be tested. Sparrows, mice, flies, and mosquitoes, some places can't see them now, but when summer comes, some flies and mosquitoes will come out again, and sparrows and mice will also appear. These things reproduce very quickly, and they cannot be completely eliminated by one or several "battles," but require a long-term struggle, the more you fight, the fewer there will be, until they are basically eliminated, and you must continue to struggle to consolidate the achievements. Greening means that the trees are planted, survived, and grew crowns, that's what is really called greening. The greening announced by various places at present is only the first step of greening, and it is still necessary to support the survival, continue to replant and encrypt, until it grows into green shade, which is a fairly long-term work. Proposing the task of mechanization is necessary, and we must continue to urge urban industry to serve agriculture. But the machines are still in trial production, some have not been completely finalized, and have not been produced in large quantities. If we overemphasize mechanization in rural areas now, it may divert the attention of the masses to waiting for mechanization, and relax efforts on farm tool improvement, semi-mechanization, and breeding of improved draft animals, which can achieve the fastest results in the short term, which also needs attention. Water conservancy, the situation varies from place to place, and the requirements put forward now are also different. Some places require: "A rainfall of 200 millimeters does not form a flood, and 50 days without rain does not form a drought." Some require higher than this, and some require lower than this. In short, there is a limit, and disasters cannot be avoided beyond this limit. Therefore, the realization of water conservancy proposed by various places at present is only the first step, and it is still necessary to continue to improve and consolidate. At the same time, we must also see that the water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring can expand the irrigated area by 350 million mu according to the calculated benefit area of ​​the project, which is indeed true; however, because the time to start construction was after the winter wheat was planted last year and after the flood season last year, some cultivated land planned for irrigation cannot be leveled before the wheat harvest, some projects have not stored water, and some because the water lifting tools cannot keep up, so that the area that can truly exert irrigation benefits before the flood season this year is not all of the 350 million mu, but 50% to 60% of it, and we can strive for 70% or more for planting wheat in the autumn. This year is the same, and the projects built later are still the same. In addition, a small part of the projects made last winter and this spring will be of poor quality and become waste products, or may not withstand the test in the flood season and collapse. These should be analyzed clearly and estimated in advance. Similarly, soil and water conservation projects also have similar situations, and they cannot completely control soil erosion in the year the project is done. Other technical measures for increasing agricultural production are also unavoidable to cause individual problems and bring local losses in active experimentation and promotion. However, in any case, this kind of loss is much smaller than the loss caused by right-leaning conservative thinking, not doing things that can be done objectively, and the latter is much larger. The saddle-shaped development process of the three winters and springs since the winter of 1955 fully proves this point. Explaining the above-mentioned problems appropriately in advance is good for protecting the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres, making them mentally prepared early, which can avoid being mentally unprepared, discouraged, and frustrated when problems occur; it can also prevent another anti-"rash advance" storm.

In addition, it should also be estimated that there may be two or three major floods and droughts in the ten years from this year to 1967. When formulating the plan to achieve the forty articles of the program, this possibility should be estimated. We should fully encourage the peasants' spirit of "angering the Dragon King," the spirit of man conquering nature, and the spirit of tenacious struggle against various natural disasters; however, when planning specific indicators, we must fully estimate the possibility of various natural disasters. This is both going all out and leaving room for maneuver. This is to make the vigorous mass movement truly invincible.

Despite the various problems and difficulties that may occur, in general, the social productive forces that have been greatly liberated are fully capable of achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. How many years in advance should each province, city, autonomous region, special district, county, township, and society determine different time limits according to their respective conditions. Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have already put forward plans to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program in the second five-year plan or a year or two longer. This has completely realistic possibilities. We believe that hundreds of millions of liberated peasants, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, will surely be able to create groundbreaking records with their heroic labor.

(III)

Now I will talk about some new major revisions and supplements to the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. Last October, the revised draft of this program was published and submitted to agricultural cooperatives and the entire people to launch discussions and solicit opinions. By the end of April this year, a total of 1,891 opinions had been received from various places, parties, units, and individuals, which were compiled and sorted into 337 items; also received were more focused opinions from the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees, which were compiled and sorted into 293 items. Based on these opinions, especially based on the practical experience from the new high tide of agriculture since last winter, some necessary revisions and supplements have been made to the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, which is the second revised draft issued to all comrades present. Among them, the main revisions and supplements are:

First, in terms of production targets, the target for developing oil crops has been added. This is in line with the requirements of comprehensively and rapidly developing agricultural production. From now on, we must vigorously develop oil crops and raise oil crops to the same important position as grain and cotton. The National Agricultural Development Program requires the unit area yield of oil crops to be increased by one to two times. Peanut yields should reach 300 to 500 jin per mu, rapeseed should reach 100 to 300 jin per mu, and soybeans should reach 200 to 400 jin per mu. This is entirely possible and can be achieved ahead of schedule.

In terms of the cotton yield per mu target, the "forty jin" has been deleted, and the old appearance of the draft published in January 1956 has been restored; that is to say, it still requires the cotton yield per mu to reach 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of lint cotton respectively. This is because the average unit area yield of cotton in the country in 1957 has reached 38 jin of lint cotton per mu, and a considerable part of the cotton fields has exceeded the target of 40 jin per mu; therefore, it is no longer meaningful to propose 40 jin as a goal.

On the other hand, some people also advocate that the grain yield per mu target should be higher than 800 jin and the cotton yield per mu target should be higher than 100 jin of lint cotton, and put forward a higher level of requirements. We believe that, according to the principle of "both going all out and leaving room for maneuver," each province (city, autonomous region) can completely formulate indicators for achieving and overfulfilling the targets stipulated in the program ahead of schedule according to the specific local conditions, and the national program can no longer put forward higher requirements. In Article 2 of the program, several "excepted areas" have been deleted, and a new wording has been adopted, that is, provinces (cities, autonomous regions) are allowed to set separate targets for areas with particularly good or particularly poor natural conditions within their province (city, autonomous region). When formulating the program, we also estimated the possible occurrence of particularly serious natural disasters such as major floods and droughts. In this way, the indicators set by the program are both positive and flexible and reliable.

Second, in terms of yield-increasing measures, the main change is that close planting is written as a separate article, and water conservancy and soil and water conservation are merged into one article. At the same time, the articles on water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, and mechanization have been supplemented and revised. The experience of yield increase in various places has proved that, in addition to building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, and promoting improved varieties, implementing appropriate close planting to varying degrees according to different crops and different soil, water conservancy, fertilizer, and other conditions is a very important measure to increase unit yield. But this, like other advanced yield-increasing measures, often encounters resistance from conservative and backward thinking. Now, writing it as a separate article in the forty articles of the program will more forcefully promote the implementation of this measure.

Water conservancy focuses on the policy of "small-scale as the main, storage as the main, and community-run as the main." Fertilizer has increased the pig-raising target and the yield-increasing target of chemical fertilizers. Soil improvement is written more specifically than the previous articles, especially emphasizing land transformation and deep plowing in low-yield areas. The article on mechanization and electrification has also been rewritten, reflecting the current great mass movement to improve farm tools, reflecting the possibility of developing local small-scale industries and relying on the capital accumulation of cooperatives to realize agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization, emphasizing the practical significance of the farm tool improvement movement, and also explaining the gradual transition from this bud of agricultural technology revolution to semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural cultivation. In addition, in terms of planting various high-yield crops, the target for rice planting area has been increased, and root crops have been emphasized. These supplements and revisions are all summaries of the practical experience of the new high tide of agriculture in the past six months.

Third, Article 31 of the revised draft of the program, "Eliminate illiteracy and develop rural cultural and educational undertakings," has also undergone relatively important revisions. The requirements for popularizing primary school education have been re-proposed, content such as running agricultural middle schools in rural areas and promoting work-study programs has been added, and the development of rural sports activities has also been mentioned.

In addition, some articles have been supplemented, revised, and changed in order, as well as some textual revisions, which will not be explained here one by one.

My country is a large country with a rural population accounting for 85%. It can be said that without the development of our agriculture, there would be no industrialization of our country. The realization of the National Agricultural Development Program is of great significance to the socialist industrialization of our country and the entire socialist construction cause. From the two production upsurges since the winter of 1955, the spring of 1956, and the winter of 1957, it can be clearly seen that the agricultural upsurge has promoted the industrial upsurge, fully confirming the positive role and important significance of rapidly developing agriculture in accelerating the socialist industrialization of our country. Of course, it should also be seen that the national industrialization is the foundation of agricultural modernization, and the rapid development of industry will inevitably promote the more rapid development of agriculture. Catching up with Britain in industry in fifteen years or less and realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule is the basic requirement for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report: "Our economy was originally very backward, and there is still imperialism outside our country. Only by speeding up construction as much as possible can we consolidate our socialist country and improve the people's living standards as soon as possible. In a large country like ours with a population of more than 600 million, completing the socialist construction cause as soon as possible will greatly enhance the advantages of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is conducive to the mutual assistance and cooperation of the socialist camp countries, conducive to the mutual assistance and cooperation of all peace forces in the world, and conducive to the guarantee of world peace."

It is recommended that the congress basically approve the second revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, and call on all party members and all peasants, together with the people of the whole country, to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    关于一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（第二次修正草案）的说明
    （一九五八年五月十七日）
          谭震林
    同志们！
    我受中央的委托，就一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要第二次修正草案，向大会做如下说明：
    （一）
    全国农业发展纲要，是在一九五五年冬季农村社会主义高潮期间提出来的。一九五六年一月，中央政治局通过和公布了全国农业发展纲要草案，对于农业生产高潮起了直接的推动作用，对于广大农民的革命干劲，发生了巨大的鼓舞力量。在一九五五年冬到一九五六年春，全国扩大灌溉面积一亿三千万亩，积肥五百多亿担。一九五六年，全国遭受了相当严重的自然灾害，而全国的粮食总产量，比年成好的一九五五年增加了一百五十亿斤。有些自然条件较好的省，一九五六年的粮食、棉花、油料的总产量，都比一九五五年增加百分之十以上，有些县，这一年的粮、棉、油总产量比一九五五年增加了百分之几十。
    但是，在一九五六年下半年和一九五七年春季，在反对所谓“冒进”的这种空气下面，多快好省的建设方针，对建设事业采取促进态度的方针，农业发展纲要四十条，受到某些人的怀疑。其结果是损害了群众的积极性，影响了一九五七年生产建设战线上特别是农业战线上的进展。在一九五六年冬到一九五七年春，灌溉面积只扩大三千六百多万亩，积肥总量降至四百多亿担；一九五七年的全国粮食播种面积，比一九五六年减少了五千五百万亩。在仍然坚持农业发展纲要四十条的地区，一九五七年的农业生产却获得了显著的进展，并且出现了一批高额丰产的先进单位。这些事实，对于打破农业生产发展上的右倾保守思想，是一种有力的武器。
    一九五七年九月党的三中全会上，重申了多快好省地建设社会主义的方针。接着，党中央又重新公布了经过修正的农业发展纲要草案。党中央的这些正确的指示，同反右派斗争和全民整风运动所造成的群众积极性相结合，才又在更大规模上产生了去冬以来农业生产的新高潮。曾经对于多快好省的方针和农业发展纲要四十条发生怀疑的那些同志，有些人已从这样一次反复中得到了教训，有些人则仍在等待秋后算账。让他们去等待罢，反正他们要算输的。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞之下，经过全党全民的整风运动，全党思想大解放，作风大转变，在全国人民当中，开展了共产主义思想解放运动。伟大的人民，不仅动手而且动脑，正在发挥着无穷无尽的智慧和力量，打破了右倾保守的障碍，在社会主义建设事业中创造了前无古人的奇迹。
    从去年十月到今年四月底，在农业生产战线上，出现了大跃进的形势。全国水利工程建设按照工程应有的受益面积计算，可扩大灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，可改善灌溉面积一亿四千万亩，治理了低洼易涝的耕地两亿多亩，改造了瘠薄的耕地一亿多亩，植树造林二亿九千万亩，控制水土流失的面积十六万平方公里。积肥三千一百亿担，数量比第一次高潮的一九五六年多五倍，虽然主要是土肥和泥肥，但按肥效来说也增加了两倍以上。全国粮食播种面积预计将比一九五七年增加八千万亩。
    同时，在全国农村中开展了群众性的改良农具运动，农民创造和改良的各式农具，加工工具和运输工具，种类之多，数以万计，经各省选送到全国农具展览会的已有三千种以上。这种群众性的改良农具运动，是农村中伟大的技术革命的萌芽，随着工业的发展，将逐步实现农业耕作的半机械化和机械化。
    目前各地夏收作物生长良好，丰收在望。广东、广西、江西的油菜已经收获，预计这三个省的油菜产量将比一九五七年增加一倍。一般说来，夏收作物的收成比较稳定，增产潜力也很大，抓紧夏季丰收，提高夏收作物在全年收获中的比重，是争取农业大丰收的重要一环，这一点，已经引起各地重视。预计今年夏收作物的总产量可能比一九五七年增加二百亿斤左右。
    综合各省规划，今年全国稻谷的播种面积将比一九五七年增加一亿一千多万亩，其中旱田改水田六千七百万亩，单季改双季四千四百万亩；薯类的播种面积比去年增加六千四百万亩；玉米比去年增加二千三百万亩。高产作物播种面积的增加，密植的比较普遍的采用，这些都是增加今年粮食产量的可靠条件。此外，九千万亩棉花的播种工作已经基本完成，有灌溉设施的棉田比一九五七年增加了两千万亩，又有一千七百万亩棉田改用了岱字棉良种。
    从夏收作物的生长情况和部分地区收获的实绩看，从春耕进行的情况看，从上述水利、肥料、改良农具、改良土壤和其他各项增产措施的实绩以及防治病虫害的农药农械等物资准备的情况看，今年的条件不仅是一九五七年所不能比拟的，而且也大大超过第一个高潮一九五六年。如果今年不遇到大水大旱，粮、棉、油等农产品一定会有较大比例的增长，例如，全国粮食增长的比例，将有可能达到百分之十几到二十几。
    上述情况说明，从一九五五年冬季以来，这三个冬春、三个年头的农业生产建设显示了两头高中间低的马鞍形的过程。这种反复是坏事，同时也是好事。它生动地教育了干部，教育了人民，使人们有所比较，从而更清楚地了解到：必须坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志所提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，必须艰苦奋斗，努力实现全国农业发展纲要。全国农业发展纲要，就是这条总路线在农业生产和农村社会主义建设方面的具体纲领。
    （二）
    自从一九五七年冬季开始农业新高潮以来，全国各省（市、自治区），各专区、县、乡、社，都提出了提前实现和超额完成全国农业发展纲要的规划。按照各省（市、自治区）的规划，全国共有几百个县（市），计划在今年分别达到粮食亩产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤或者皮棉亩产一百斤。还有许多单位提出提前实现“水利化”、“机械化”、“绿化”和“四无”等口号。根据各地检查摸底的初步结果，计划粮食亩产实现“四、五、八”的县（市）和计划实现亩产百斤皮棉的县（市），大部分是工作基础较好，指标深入群众，措施比较切实，并且已经认真行动起来。但是，也有少数县（市），指标虽然先进，却还没有真正深入到生产队和社员，措施落后于指标，行动落后于措施。甚至还有的单位，指标也不够先进。必须抓紧时机，克服这些薄弱环节。
    现在，各地提出的增产指标一般是积极的，问题在于切实抓紧具体措施。年终评比，看实际增产结果，就是一个考验。要注意防止浮而不深、粗而不细、华而不实，以免到秋后达不到指标要求。某些单位提出的增产指标，看来很高，似乎难以实现，但是从他们提出的措施看，实现指标是有一定的根据的，并且他们确确实实在那里认真地干，脚踏实地地干，他们并不是华而不实。但是无论是那一种情况，我们都必须考虑到客观条件方面出现不利因素的可能，例如发生不能控制的自然灾害，或者由于某些措施的客观条件不具备而落空。预先计算到这种可能，就可以使干部和群众有必要的精神准备，使他们在不利条件下仍然能够保持旺盛的干劲。总之，必须实行毛主席的指示：既鼓干劲，又留余地。
    在“四无”、“绿化”、“机械化”、“水利化”等等问题上，同样要注意踏实，防止虚报和浮夸。在这些方面，现在我们都已经取得了巨大的成就。但是这些成就还需要经受考验。麻雀、老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子，现在有些地方打得看不见了，但是一到夏天，苍蝇、蚊子又会出来了一些，麻雀、老鼠也还会出现。这些东西繁殖是很快的，不是一个或几个“战役”就可以完全消灭的，而是要长期斗争，越打越少，以至基本消灭，并且还要继续斗争，才能把成绩巩固下来。绿化是要树栽下去，成活了，长了树冠，那才真叫绿化了。目前各地宣布的绿化只是绿化的第一步，还需要扶育成活，继续补栽加密，一直到成长得绿叶成荫，这是相当长期的工作。提出机械化的任务是必要的，必须继续督促城市工业为农业服务。可是机械还在试制，有的还没有完全定型，还没有大量生产出来。现在在农村中如果过多强调机械化，可能把群众的注意力吸引到等待机械化，而对于眼前见效最快的农具改良、半机械化和繁殖改良耕畜放松了努力，这也要注意。水利化，各地情况不同，现在所提的要求也不同。有的地方要求：“一次降雨二百公厘不形成水灾，五十天不降雨不形成旱灾”。有的要求比这个高，有的要求比这个还低些。总之，都有一个限度，超过这个限度还是不能避免灾害，因此，现在各地提出的实现水利化，还只是第一步，还需要继续进行提高和巩固的工作。同时，还要看到：去冬今春兴修的水利工程，按工程应有的效益面积计算，可以扩大灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，这是确实的；但是，由于动手兴修的时间是在去年种冬麦以后，在去年汛期以后，所以有些计划灌溉的耕地在麦收以前还不能平整，有些工程还没有蓄上水，还有的因为提水工具跟不上去，以致在今年汛期以前真正能够发挥灌溉效益的面积并不是三亿五千万亩的全部，而是其中的百分之五十、六十，秋后种麦则可以争取到百分之七十或者更多些。今年如此，以后兴修的工程也还是如此。此外，去冬今春所作的工程，也会有很少一部分质量不高，成了废品，或者可能在汛期中经不起考验而冲垮。这些都是应该分析清楚和预先估计到的。同样，水土保持工程也有类似的情况，也不是一做了工程，当年就可以把水土流失完全控制起来。其他的农业增产的技术措施，在积极试验和推广中，也难免发生个别的毛病而带来局部的损失。但是，无论如何，这种损失，比起由于右倾保守思想，客观能办到的事情也不去办而造成的损失，前者要小得多，后者要大得多。一九五五年冬季以来，三个冬春的马鞍形的发展过程完全证明了这一点。把上述这些问题预先恰当地讲清楚，对于保护群众和干部的积极性有好处，使他们早有精神准备，这就可以避免问题一旦发生的时候，精神毫无准备，垂头丧气，挫伤积极性；也可以防止再来一个反“冒进”的风波。
    此外，还要估计到从今年起到一九六七年的十年之内，还可能出现两三个大水、大旱。在制定实现四十条纲要的规划的时候，应该把这种可能性估计在内。我们应该充分鼓励农民那种“气死龙王爷”的气概，人定胜天，与各种天灾做顽强斗争的精神；但是，在规划具体指标的时候，又必须充分估计到发生各种自然灾害的可能性。这就是既鼓足干劲，又留有余地。这就是要使蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动真正立于不败之地。
    尽管可能发生上述的种种问题和困难，然而总的看来，已经获得大解放的社会生产力，完全有可能提前实现全国农业发展纲要。究竟提前几年、各省、市、自治区，各专区、县、乡、社，应当根据各自的条件定出不同的年限。现在已经有很多省、市、自治区提出规划，争取在第二个五年计划或者稍多一两年的时间内，实现全国农业发展纲要。这具有完全现实的可能性。我们相信，解放了的几亿农民，在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，一定能够用他们自己的英雄劳动，创造出破天荒的纪录。
    （三）
    现在讲一讲对于全国农业发展纲要修正草案的一些新的主要的修改和补充。去年十月公布了这个纲要的修正草案，提交农业合作社和全体人民展开讨论、征求意见，到今年四月底止，总共收到各地方、各方面、各单位和个人的意见一千八百九十一条，综合整理为三百三十七条；又收到各省、市、自治区党委的比较集中的意见，综合整理为二百九十三条。根据这些意见，特别是根据从去冬以来的农业新高潮中的实践经验，对于全国农业发展纲要的修正草案又作了一些必要的修改和补充，这就是发给到会各位同志的第二次修正草案。其中，主要的修改和补充是：
    第一，在生产指标方面，增加了发展油料作物的指标。这是符合于全面地、迅速地发展农业生产的要求的。从现在起，要大力发展油料，要把油料提高到和粮食、棉花一样重要的位置。全国农业发展纲要要求油料作物的单位面积产量提高一倍到两倍。花生亩产达到三百斤到五百斤，油菜达到一百斤到三百斤，大豆达到二百斤到四百斤。这是完全可能做到，并且可能提前实现的。
    在棉花亩产量指标方面，把“四十斤”删去了，重新恢复了一九五六年一月公布的草案的老样子；就是说，仍然要求棉花亩产量分别达到六十斤、八十斤、一百斤皮棉的要求。这是因为一九五七年全国棉花的平均单位面积产量已经达到了亩产三十八斤皮棉，有相当大的一部分棉田已经超过了亩产四十斤的指标；因而再提出四十斤作为奋斗目标就没有什么意义了。
    另一方面，也有人主张粮食亩产指标在八百斤以上和棉花亩产指标在一百斤皮棉以上，再提出更高一格的要求。我们认为，根据“既鼓干劲，又留余地”的原则，各省（市、自治区）完全可以根据本地具体情况制定提前和超额完成纲要规定的指标，全国的纲要可以不再提更高的要求。在纲要第二条中，把几种“除外地区”删掉了，而改为新的提法，即允许省（市、自治区）对于本省（市、自治区）境内自然条件特别好或者特别差的地区另定指标。在制定纲要的时候，我们还把可能发生的大水、大旱等特别严重的自然灾害也估计在内了。这样，使纲要所定的指标既是积极的，而又是灵活的，可靠的。
    第二，在增产措施方面，主要是把密植单独写成一条，而把水利和水土保持合并成一条。同时补充和修改了关于水利、肥料、土壤和机械化等条款，各地增产的经验证明，除了兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤和推广良种以外，按照不同的作物和不同的土壤、水利、肥料等条件，实行不同程度的适当密植，是提高单位产量的一项很重要的措施。但是这也同其他先进的增产措施一样，常常遇到保守落后思想的抵抗。现在，在四十条纲要里面把它单独写成一条，将更加有力地推动密植这项措施的实行。
    水利，着重讲了“以小型为主、以蓄为主、以社办为主”的方针。肥料，提高了养猪指标和化学肥料的增产指标。改良土壤，比过去的条文写得更具体了一些，特别强调了低产地区的土地改造和土地深翻。机械化、电气化一条也重新改写了，反映了当前伟大的群众性的农具改良运动，反映了发展地方小型工业和依靠合作社的资金积累来实现农业半机械化和机械化的可能性，强调了农具改良运动的现实意义，也说明了由农业技术革命的这种萌芽逐步过渡到农业耕作的半机械化和机械化。此外，关于多种高产作物方面，提高了稻谷播种面积的指标，又着重强调了薯类。这些补充和修改都是最近半年多以来农业新高潮的实践经验的总结。
    第三，纲要修正草案第三十一条，“扫除文盲，发展农村文化教育事业”，这一条也有比较重要的修改。重新提出了普及小学教育的要求，增加了关于在农村中兴办农业中学和提倡勤工俭学等内容，也提到了开展农村体育活动。
    此外，还有一些条款做了某些补充、修改和次序的变动，以及一些文字上的修改，在这里不一一解释了。
    我国是一个农村人口占85％的大国，可以说，没有我国农业的发展，便没有我国的工业化。实现全国农业发展纲要，对于我国的社会主义工业化和整个的社会主义建设事业，具有十分重要的意义。从一九五五年冬、五六年春和一九五七年冬季以来的两次生产高潮中，可以清楚地看到农业的高潮对于工业高潮起了推动作用，完全证实了迅速地发展农业对于加速我国社会主义工业化的积极作用和重要意义。当然，同时也应该看到，国家工业化是农业现代化的基础，工业的迅速发展反过来也就必然推动农业更迅速的发展。工业上在十五年或者更短的时间内赶上英国，农业上提前实现全国农业发展纲要，这就是多快好省地建设社会主义的基本要求。正如少奇同志在报告中所指出的：“我国经济本来很落后，我国的外部还有帝国主义，只有尽可能地加快建设，才能尽快地巩固我们的社会主义国家，提高人民的生活水平。在我国这样一个六亿多人口的大国中，尽快地完成社会主义建设事业，又必将大大增强以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的优势，有利于社会主义阵营各国的互助合作，有利于世界上一切和平力量的互助合作，有利于世界和平的保障。”
    建议大会基本上通过全国农业发展纲要第二次修正草案，并且号召全党同志和全体农民一起，和全国人民一起，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。
