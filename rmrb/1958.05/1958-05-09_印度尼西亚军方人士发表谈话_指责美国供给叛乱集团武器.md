Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. According to the Associated Press, a prominent Indonesian military figure accused the United States on the 7th of supplying large quantities of weapons to Indonesian rebels.

The Associated Press quoted the person as saying that the R.S. Hersh American Sales Company, located at 684 McAllister Street in San Francisco, had expressed its willingness to sell 50,000 semi-automatic rifles and 15 million rounds of ammunition to Indonesian rebels.

The person pointed out that this expression by the company was made with the full knowledge of the U.S. government.

The person also cited a telegram intercepted by the Indonesian government forces in early April. This telegram indicated that the above-mentioned number of weapons could be provided to Djambek, the "Minister of the Interior" of the Indonesian rebel group that was once entrenched in Bukittinggi. He also pointed out that Indonesian rebels had also had similar telegram communications with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group in March and April.

The person said that he knew the names of all the American and Chiang Kai-shek Group pilots who were allegedly flying for the Indonesian rebels. He said that these names had been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After this fact was revealed, U.S. State Department officials immediately came out to deny that the government had ever been "involved" in the matter.

With the facts in evidence, R.S. Hersh of the R.S. Hersh American Sales Company had no choice but to admit in San Francisco on the same day that he had expressed his willingness to provide weapons to the Indonesian rebels. At the same time, his nephew came out and said that the telegram to the rebels was sent by him on April 3rd. However, he also attempted to exonerate the U.S. government, saying that he had not obtained the approval of the State Department, and that he only believed that "it was in the U.S. interest."

After issuing this message, the Associated Press immediately hurriedly announced the cancellation of the paragraph referring to the R.S. Hersh American Sales Company, saying, "Cancellation of this paragraph is mandatory."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. According to Antara News Agency, Lieutenant Colonel Piangadi, a spokesman for the Indonesian Army, accused certain Philippine official institutions on the evening of the 7th of participating in the current activities of Indonesian rebels. It is reported that Piangadi's accusation is based on the information that the leaders of the rebel group, Warouw and others, can recently conduct activities in the Philippines without being inspected by the Philippine customs and immigration authorities due to the convenience provided by some Philippine officials.

On the same evening, Piangadi once again exposed the activities of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group airdropping weapons to the Manado rebels. Piangadi said that a few days ago, the captain of a steamboat who escaped from the rebel-controlled sea reported to the Southern Maluku Defense Command that he had personally seen Taiwanese transport planes often flying to the rebels in Manado, North Sulawesi, unloading many boxes of weapons, all of which were written in Chinese characters.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. A message from Singapore on the 7th by United Press International shows that the Indonesian rebels hope that the incident of American planes bombing foreign merchant ships in Indonesian territorial waters will enable the imperialists to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs in the name of the United Nations and obstruct the Indonesian government from taking military action against the rebels.

The message said that journalists who interviewed in Padang and Bukittinggi found that some leaders of the rebels strongly believed that interference by the United Nations to "maintain the status quo" in Indonesia would "help the rebel cause." The message said that the rebels hoped that after creating a situation of "maintaining the status quo," the Indonesian government would encounter economic difficulties.

The message said that rebel leader Sjafruddin had repeatedly requested the United Nations to intervene. If the bombing of foreign ships continues, the United Nations may intervene directly.

The message also said that another purpose of this bombing was to prevent the Indonesian government forces from gathering near Manado, the rebel center in North Sulawesi.

    印度尼西亚军方人士发表谈话
    指责美国供给叛乱集团武器
    新华社8日讯　雅加达消息：据美联社报道，一位权威的印度尼西亚军方人士7日指责美国以大量武器供给印度尼西亚的叛乱分子。
    美联社援引这位人士的话说，旧金山麦卡利斯特街六百八十四号的罗·斯·赫尔什美国销售公司表示愿意卖给印度尼西亚叛乱分子五万支半自动式步枪和一千五百万发子弹。
    这位人士指出，这家公司的这种表示是在美国政府完全知情的情况下进行的。
    这位人士还引证了印度尼西亚政府军在4月初截获的一分电报。这份电报向曾经盘踞在武吉丁宜的印度尼西亚叛乱集团的“内政部长”贾姆贝克表示可以提供上述数目的武器。他还指出，印度尼西亚叛乱分子在3月间和4月间还曾经同台湾蒋介石集团通过类似的电报。
    这位人士说，他知道所有那些据说正在为印度尼西亚叛乱分子开飞机的美国驾驶员和蒋介石集团的驾驶员的姓名。他说，这些姓名已经交到外交部。
    这一事实被揭发后，美国国务院官员立即出来否认政府曾经“参与”这件事。
    由于事实俱在，赫尔什美国销售公司的罗·斯·赫尔什不能不于当天在旧金山承认，他曾经表示愿意提供武器给印度尼西亚叛军。同时，他的侄子又跑出来说，给叛军的电报是他在4月3日发出的。但是，他又企图给美国政府开脱说：他没有获得国务院的批准，他只是认为“这符合美国利益”。
    美联社在发出了这条消息之后，随即慌忙通告取消关于指明罗·斯·赫尔什美国销售公司的那一段，并且说，“取消这一段是强制性的”。
    新华社雅加达8日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪中校在7日晚上指责某些菲律宾官方机构参与了印度尼西亚叛乱分子目前进行的活动。据报道，皮恩加迪的指责是根据这样的消息：叛乱集团的头子瓦罗等人最近由于一些菲律宾官员给予方便，可以在到菲律宾进行活动时不受菲律宾海关和移民当局检查。
    皮恩加迪在同一天晚上再次揭露台湾蒋介石集团空投武器给万鸦老叛乱分子的活动。皮恩加迪说，几天以前一位连船逃出叛乱分子控制的海面的汽船船长向南马鲁古防区司令部报告说，他曾经亲眼看到台湾的运输机经常飞到北苏拉威西万鸦老的叛乱分子那里，卸下许多箱武器，箱子上都写有中国字。
    新华社8日讯　从合众社7日自新加坡发出的一条消息中可以看出，印度尼西亚叛乱分子希望美国飞机在印度尼西亚领海轰炸外国商船的事件能使帝国主义者借联合国名义来干涉印度尼西亚内政，阻挠印度尼西亚政府对叛乱分子采取军事行动。
    这条消息说，在巴东和武吉丁宜采访过的记者们发现，叛乱分子中的某些头子强烈地认为，由联合国出来干涉，使印度尼西亚局势“维持现状”，会“有助于叛乱事业”。消息说，叛乱分子希望在造成“维持现状”的局面以后使印度尼西亚政府在经济上遭到困难。
    消息说，叛乱分子头子沙弗鲁丁曾经几次要求联合国进行干涉。如果继续轰炸外国船只，联合国可能直接干预。
    消息还说，这种轰炸的另一个目的是为了不让印度尼西亚政府军在靠近北苏拉威西叛乱中心万鸦老的地方集结。
