Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. A Marxist theoretical team of the Party consisting of five hundred people, under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, was officially formed on the 140th anniversary of Marx's birth.

In recent months, the Municipal Party Committee has taken a series of measures to strengthen theoretical work. It has repeatedly discussed the establishment of a Party theoretical team and the creation of a theoretical publication, and decided to establish a theoretical team of 500 people as the core force of Shanghai's theoretical team, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee.

The members of this team were carefully selected by Party organizations at all levels, and determined according to the principle of voluntary participation. The majority of them are veteran cadres with good political qualities, certain practical work experience and cultural theoretical level, and also include some social scientists and young intellectuals. In addition to the 500-person theoretical team directly led by the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Party Committee also decided that the Party committees of the Municipal Party Committee departments, district committees, universities and industrial departments should reorganize their original theoretical instructors and establish their own theoretical teams.

According to the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the main task of this theoretical team is to carry out the struggle of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism" on the theoretical front. They are required to study Marxist-Leninist classics and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong according to the principles of linking theory with practice, emphasizing the present over the past, and learning while doing. They should focus on studying the practical problems in China's socialist revolution and construction, especially the practical problems in Shanghai's revolution and construction, to determine the research direction of each discipline.

The training methods for this team mainly involve going deep into reality, engaging in labor training, conducting investigations and research, summarizing experiences, participating in theoretical struggles and the criticism of bourgeois academic thought; veteran cadres go to schools to teach, from giving reports and holding special lectures to teaching a course. A preliminary list has been drawn up of more than 60 people, including the secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee and ministers of various departments, to teach at universities; those who teach in schools go to business departments to give reports and undertake scientific research tasks entrusted by business departments; and it is stipulated that each person should write at least two theoretical articles each year. At the same time, Party organizations at all levels are required to provide them with some necessary learning conditions, give them some creative leave, and require them to participate in various academic activities of philosophical and social science societies. Through the above methods, these 500 people are required to achieve the following within five years: be able to independently teach a course in Party schools and universities; be able to independently conduct scientific research and write works; and be able to frequently write theoretical articles for newspapers and magazines.

The Municipal Party Committee has decided to create a theoretical monthly magazine called "Liberation". The publication's policy is determined as follows: to discuss and study major issues in practical work, as well as theoretical issues raised by cadres and the academic community, from the perspective of dialectical materialism. The Municipal Party Committee is drawing cadres to form an editorial department, which is scheduled to be published on August 1.

At the founding meeting, Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shi Ximin, Minister of the Propaganda Department, and Comrade Chen Qiwu all spoke at the meeting. They hoped that everyone would break superstitions, break the mysterious view of theory, connect with reality, establish a communist style, promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism, and strive for the greater victory of Marxism.

Those who attended the founding meeting included members of this theoretical team, as well as heads of various departments of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, and heads of Party committees of various districts and universities, totaling more than 900 people.

    在理论战线上进行“兴无灭资”的斗争
    上海组成五百人的理论队伍
    据新华社上海7日电　中共上海市委直接领导的一支五百人的党的马克思主义的理论队伍，在马克思诞生一百四十周年纪念日正式组成了。
    最近几个月以来，市委就加强理论工作，采取了一系列措施，就建立党的理论队伍和创办理论刊物问题反复进行了讨论，决定建立一支五百人的理论队伍，作为上海理论队伍的核心力量，由市委直接领导。
    这支队伍的成员都是经过各级党组织慎重挑选，并根据本人自愿参加的原则确定的。其中绝大部分都是政治品质好，有一定实际工作经验和文化理论水平的老干部，也包括一些社会科学家和青年知识分子。除市委直接领导的五百人理论队伍以外，市委还决定市委各部委、区委、高等学校和产业部门党委整顿原有的理论教员队伍，建立自己的理论队伍。
    根据中共上海市委的规定，这支理论队伍的主要任务是在理论战线上进行“兴无灭资”的斗争。要求他们根据理论联系实际、厚今薄古、边干边学的方针，学习马列主义经典著作和毛泽东同志的著作，并以研究我国社会主义革命和建设中的实际问题，特别是上海革命与建设工作中的实际问题为中心，确定每一学科的研究方向。
    这支队伍的培养方法，主要是通过深入实际、劳动锻炼、调查研究、总结经验、参加理论斗争和资产阶级学术思想的批判工作；老干部到学校去教书，由作报告，举行专题讲座到教一门课，目前已初步排定由市委书记和各部部长等六十多人到大学去授课的名单；在学校教书的人就到业务部门作报告，担任业务部门委托的科学研究任务；并且规定每人每年至少写出理论文章两篇。同时要求各级党组织为他们提供一些必要的学习条件，给他们一些创作假期，要求他们参加哲学、社会科学各学会的各种学术活动。通过以上办法，要求这五百人在五年内达到：能在党校和高等学校中独立地开一门课；能独立进行科学研究写出著作，能经常为报刊杂志写理论文章。
    市委已决定创办一个名为“解放”的理论月刊。刊物的方针确定：以辩证唯物主义的观点来讨论和研究实际工作中的重大问题，以及干部和学术界提出的理论问题。市委正在抽调干部组成编辑部，预定在8月1日出版。
    在成立大会上，中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显、宣传部部长石西民和陈其五同志都在会上讲了话。他们希望大家破除迷信，打破对理论的神秘观点，联系实际，树立共产主义的风格，兴无灭资，为马克思主义的更大胜利而斗争。
    出席成立大会的有这支理论队伍的成员，还有市委和市人委的各部门负责人以及各区委、各高等学校党委负责人等共九百多人。
