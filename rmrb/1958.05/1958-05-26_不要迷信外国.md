Don't Be Superstitious About Foreign Countries
Méi ěr

It is reported that when the Shanghai Huafu Gold Pen Factory put forward the slogan of making the Hero gold pen catch up with the American Parker pen, a British Reuters reporter came to the factory specifically and asked with a contemptuous attitude: "What conditions do you have to catch up with Parker?" The factory's employees answered well: "Rely on our own hands!"

It is not surprising that a reporter from a capitalist country would take such an attitude. What is strange is that some people in this factory have similar thoughts. When worker Xu Zuying wanted to reduce the gold plating content of the pen cap from 92% and catch up with the Parker pen cap in terms of color and gloss, the head of the factory's technology section said: "No theoretical basis for this can be found in Chinese and foreign books." The implication is that if foreign countries haven't solved the problem, how can you solve it? There are not many people like the head of the technology section, but they are not isolated cases either. These people are deeply superstitious about foreign countries, especially the United States and Britain. In their view, everything in the United States and Britain is the best in the world. Therefore, some people once ridiculed these people, saying, "Even the moon is better in America." These people have a ridiculous logic: what the United States and Britain can do, China cannot do; and what China can do, the United States and Britain can do. Things of course only develop according to their own laws, not according to the imagination of these people. Therefore, China is constantly producing great inventors: the Han Dynasty had Cai Lun, the inventor of paper, and Zhang Heng, the creator of the armillary sphere and the seismograph; the Southern and Northern Dynasties had Zu Chongzhi, the fifth-century authority on the world's circumference; the Ming Dynasty had the great pharmacologist Li Shizhen; the Qing Dynasty had the excellent railway engineer Zhan Tianyou…

Not to mention these distant things, just look at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition held recently in Beijing, which exhibited many agricultural tools and instruments created and transformed by farmers. Everyone who visited this exhibition felt that the wisdom of the Chinese working people is endless.

The reason why these people say that American and British things are the best in the world is purely superstition. It cannot be denied that the United States and Britain have the best things in the world, but they also have the most backward things; it cannot be denied that China has the most backward things in the world, but it also has the best things in the world. Moreover, the first and the last are not fixed. Today it is first, tomorrow it may not be first, it may be last; today it is last, tomorrow it may not be last, it may be first. If the first no longer moves forward, it will become the last; if the last keeps moving forward, it will become the first. First and last are two contradictory aspects that can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. China's industrial construction is backward, but in fifteen years, in terms of major industrial products, it can catch up with and surpass Britain. Isn't this the China that was originally backward in industrial construction catching up to the front of Britain, which is developed in industrial construction?

In the minds of some people, foreign countries are always better than their own country. In fact, one's own country and foreign countries are also two contradictory aspects. Chinese people see the United States and Britain as foreign countries, and Americans and British people see China as a foreign country.

The problem is not whether it is a foreign country or not, but whether there are diligent hands and clever minds. With these two treasures, anything can be done, anything can be done well, and anything can be done faster, better, and more economically than other countries – the best in the world. Chinese people have no fewer diligent hands and clever minds than foreigners. On the contrary, China has a large population, is famous for its diligence, and is a liberated Chinese people. What reason is there for China to lag behind the United States and Britain? What reason is there for China not to surpass the United States and Britain? The employees of the Huafu Gold Pen Factory are unwilling to lag behind, so they loudly answered the Reuters reporter: Relying on our hands, we must make the Hero gold pen catch up with the American Parker pen.

In fact, the Chinese working people have already sent out a signal, not only to surpass the United States in gold pens, but also to surpass Britain and the United States in other aspects. In a few years, a brand-new situation will emerge: China will have what the United States and Britain have; and China will have what the United States and Britain may not have, or will have only after a period of time; what Americans and British people can manufacture, Chinese people can manufacture; and what Chinese people can manufacture, Americans and British people may not be able to manufacture, or will be able to manufacture only after a period of time.

The superstition of foreign countries must be broken. Only by breaking it can we throw off the heavy stone on our backs, raise our heads, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and catch up with foreign countries in all aspects. But breaking superstition is not a simple matter. China has been liberated from imperialist colonial rule for nearly ten years, but the thinking of some people has not yet been completely liberated, and they still retain more or less the original slave mentality of the colonial period. The British Reuters reporter dared to hold that contemptuous attitude towards the Chinese people precisely because he saw this "secret."

    不要迷信外国
    梅耳
    据报载，当上海华孚金笔厂提出要使英雄金笔赶上美国的派克金笔的口号时，英国路透社记者特地赶到这个工厂，以蔑视的态度问：“你们以什么条件赶上派克？”这个厂的职工回答得好：“靠我们自己双手！”
    一个资本主义国家的记者持这样的态度，是不足为奇的。奇怪的是在这个工厂里竟有人有着类似的思想。当工人徐祖英要把金笔的笔套的镀金成分从92％降下来，在颜色和光泽方面并赶上派克金笔的笔套时，这个工厂的技术科长说：“这在中外书籍里都找不到理论根据的。”言外之意，外国都没有解决的问题你能解决。像技术科长这样的人是不很多的，但也不是极个别的。这些人迷信外国实际上就是美国、英国是很深的。在他们看来，美国和英国的一切东西，都是世界上第一。因此曾经有人挖苦这些人说：“连月亮也是美国的好。”这些人有一个可笑的逻辑：美国和英国能够做到的，中国就做不到；而中国能够做到的，美国和英国都能够做到。事物当然只是按照自己的规律发展，而不是按照这些人的想像发展的，因此，中国不断地出现着伟大的创造发明家：汉代有纸的发明者蔡伦和浑天仪和候风地动仪的创造者张衡、南北朝时有五世纪世界圆周率的权威祖冲之、明代有大药物学家李时珍、清代有优秀的铁路工程师詹天佑……。
    不说这些远的，就说最近在北京举行的全国农具展览会上，就展出了许许多多农民创造和改造的农具和工具。所有参观这个展览会的人都觉得：中国劳动人民的智慧是无穷无尽的。
    这些人所以说美国和英国的东西都是世界第一，完全是迷信。不能否认美国和英国有世界第一的东西，但是也有世界最落后的东西；不能否认中国有世界最落后的东西，但也有世界第一的东西。而且第一和最后，也不是固定不变的，今天是第一，明天就不一定是第一，可能是最后；今天是最后，明天就不一定是最后，可能是第一。第一不再前进，就会变为最后；最后不断前进就会变成第一。第一和最后是矛盾的两个方面，在一定条件下可以互相转化。中国工业建设是落后的，但是在十五年之后，在主要工业产品方面可以赶上和超过英国，这不是原来工业建设落后的中国，赶到了工业建设发达的英国的前面了吗？。
    在某些人的思想中，外国总是比本国的好。其实，本国和外国，也是矛盾的两个方面。中国人看美国、英国是外国，而美国人和英国人看中国也是外国。
    问题不在于外国不外国，而在于有没有勤劳的双手和聪明的头脑。有了这两宝，什么事情都可以办成，什么事情都可以办好，什么事情都可以比其他国家作得多快好省——世界第一。勤劳的双手，聪明的头脑，中国人并不少于外国人，相反的，中国人口多，又是以勤劳出名的，而且是解放了的中国人。有什么理由中国一定要落后于美国和英国呢？有什么理由中国不能超过美国和英国呢？华孚金笔厂的职工正是不甘于落后，所以响亮地回答路透社记者：靠我们的双手，一定要使英雄金笔赶上美国的派克金笔。
    事实上，中国劳动人民已经发出了信号，不仅仅在金笔方面要赶过美国，在其他方面也要赶过英国和美国。在若干年之后，将会出现这样一个崭新的局面：美国和英国有的东西，中国都有；而中国有的东西，美国和英国未必都有，或者要过一个时期才有；美国人和英国人所能够制造的，中国人都能够制造；而中国人所能够制造的，美国人和英国人未必能够制造，或者要过一个时期才能制造。
    对外国的迷信必须破除，只有破除了，才能抛掉背上的千斤大石，抬起头来，敢想敢说敢做，在一切方面，赶上外国。但是要破除迷信，却是一件不简单的事情。中国从帝国主义殖民统治下解放出来已近十年，但是有些人的思想至今还没有完全解放出来，多多少少还保持着原有的殖民地时期的奴隶思想。英国路透社记者正因为看到了这个“秘密”，所以更加敢于持那种蔑视中国人的态度。
