    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of our Party has concluded victoriously. This congress was a congress of rectification, a congress of the Great Leap Forward, and a congress against revisionism. This congress marks the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of our Party, and the entry into a new period of socialist construction centered on the technological and cultural revolutions.
    The great historical significance of this congress lies in the determination of the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The congress called on all comrades of the Party to unite as one, unite with the people of the whole country, and, on the basis of continuing to complete the rectification movement, implement this general line of socialist construction. Another content of this congress was the adoption of the resolution on the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties. The resolution fully supports the Moscow Declaration and points out: "To thoroughly crush modern revisionism politically and theoretically together with fraternal parties of all countries, to defend Marxism-Leninism, and to defend the unity of the international communist movement on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism is our Party's sacred duty to the international working class." The congress also basically adopted the second revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, entrusting the Central Committee to make necessary revisions based on this year's implementation and submit it to the Second National People's Congress for adoption and promulgation. The congress called on all comrades of the Party, together with the 500 million peasants and the people of the whole country, to strive for the early realization of this program.
    The general line of socialist construction formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party is the result of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism and correctly summarizing the experience of socialist construction in our country. If the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party mainly summarized the experience of socialist transformation, then the Second Session mainly summarized the experience of the rectification movement and socialist construction. This session was able to summarize the experience of socialist construction and put forward and adopt the general line of socialist construction because the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts has been basically completed, and the Party has been able to concentrate its main forces on socialist construction. Moreover, our country's construction work has had an eight-year history, especially the lessons of the "saddle-shaped" development of high tide - low tide - greater high tide in the past three years. Through this congress, the Party and the people have obtained a sharp weapon for unifying thinking and unifying steps, which will undoubtedly produce a great effect on the rapid development of socialist construction in our country in the future.
    The Party's general line of socialist construction correctly reflects the greatest interests and urgent demands of the people of our country, and also embodies the revolutionary spirit of us Communists and the high degree of trust in the people's masses. In our country, the question of whether or not to build socialism has been resolved. The question before us is what kind of policy should be adopted for socialist construction: Should we go all out and aim high? Should we and can we do things faster and better? In the eyes of some people, our country's construction can only be slower and worse, not faster and better. They have various reasons: too large a population, too backward an economy and culture, agriculture can't grow, insufficient funds and technical forces, foreign speeds are only so high, and so on. These people are different from bourgeois rightists; they want to build socialism, but their spirit is not vigorous enough, reflecting the inferiority complex left over from the long-term oppression of our nation. They only think they are very short, and others are giants. They don't know that the liberated, awakened, united, and organized population of more than 600 million is the greatest creative force in the world. With this force, there can be the most funds and the greatest technical strength, there can be high-speed development of industry and agriculture, and everything that mankind can do can be done. In the face of the great China and the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, and the imperialist camp, are really just dwarfs. Our country's economy and culture are still very backward, but precisely because of this, the enthusiasm of our people for accelerating socialist construction is particularly great. The Party's general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster,better,andmore economical results precisely embodies the urgent demand of our people to get rid of economic and cultural backwardness as soon as possible, and shows the fearless spirit and unstoppable spirit of our people. Our Party firmly believes that as long as we arouse the enthusiasm of more than 600 million people and mobilize more than 600 million people to aim high, we will be able to carry out construction at high speed, and we will be able to catch up with all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time and become one of the most advanced and richest countries in the world. People see that it is precisely in China, where the economy and culture are backward, that the development speed and scale of the people's revolution far exceed all economically developed and culturally developed capitalist countries in Europe and America. Why can't our country similarly far exceed them in terms of construction speed and scale? We are against arrogance and complacency at any time, but inferiority and arrogance are equally low-level tastes that we must abandon. At present, the broad masses of our country have shown a noble style of breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act in the upsurge of the whole people's rectification and construction. We should carry forward this communist style and make it the style of the whole Party and the style of the whole nation. This is the key to realizing the general line.
    Since the basic starting point of the Party's general line of socialist construction is to believe in the strength of the masses and reflect the will of the masses, then the basic method for realizing this general line must also be the method of the mass line. Our country is both poor and blank, and our construction must be more, faster, better, and more economical, which is a contradiction. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to rely on the masses. The general line stipulates that industry and agriculture should be developed simultaneously in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the 500 million peasants and provide the largest market, more funds, and more raw materials for industry. Developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises simultaneously, is to enable all 20-odd provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and autonomous regions, more than 180 special zones, more than 2,000 counties, more than 80,000 townships, more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives, and more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives to give full play to their enthusiasm for developing industry, making enterprises closer to the masses and more conducive to fully tapping the potential of the masses. The technological and cultural revolutions called for by the Party, like the socialist revolutions on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, must be mass movements. And the deepening of the rectification movement, the popularization of the methods of great contending, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters, the overcoming of official airs, stagnation, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, and the promotion of methods such as planting experimental plots, working with the masses, visiting and comparing, and grasping both ends to lead the middle in leadership work, are all for correctly handling contradictions among the people and for giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. At present, the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, the blooming of local industries everywhere, the vigorous development of the agricultural tool improvement movement and the technical innovation movement, and the remarkable results of the literacy campaign, people-run primary and secondary schools, and the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests all powerfully prove that: due to the implementation of the mass line, the wisdom and talents of the people's masses have been fully utilized, and an endless and great force has been generated. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us that the mass line is the fundamental line of all the Party's work. The Party's general line of socialist construction, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report, is the application and development of the mass line in the cause of socialist construction. Applying this line in all work will surely guarantee that the cause of socialist construction will be carried out in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.
    After the Party's line has been determined, the task of the whole Party, the task of all active elements among the people of the whole country, is to implement this line, plant the red flag of the general line all over the country, and make the lighthouse of the general line illuminate all the work of the people of the whole country. At present, the whole people's rectification movement has achieved great victories, the unity within the Party and the unity of the whole people have been greatly enhanced, and all construction undertakings are in an upsurge of leap forward. All this is gratifying. But this does not mean that there are no shortcomings or difficulties in our work, that the realization of the general line will no longer have twists and turns, and that arduous struggles are no longer needed. We are revolutionary optimists, and at the same time revolutionary realists. We must see the various shortcomings and difficulties existing in our work in the face of smooth work, and also anticipate all possible difficulties and unexpected events that may occur. The general line requires our country to be built into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture as soon as possible. In order to turn this great ideal into reality, the whole Party and the people of the whole country still need to make serious efforts. All Party cadres must study tenaciously along the road of being both red and expert; study business, study politics, and study correct ideological methods, correct working methods, and work styles. We must learn to apply dialectical materialism to all practical work, learn to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and combine a serious spirit of principle with a lively and creative spirit. All comrades of our Party should, on the basis of the rectification movement, further and deeply study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and greatly improve the political and ideological level and theoretical level of our Party, in order to victoriously realize the Party's general line of socialist construction.

    把总路线的红旗插遍全国
    我们党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议已经胜利结束了。这次大会是整风的大会，是大跃进的大会，是反对修正主义的大会。这次大会标志着我国人民在我们党的领导下，已经取得了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的决定性胜利，正在进入以技术革命和文化革命为中心的社会主义建设的新时期。
    这次大会的重大历史意义在于确定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。大会号召全党同志同心同德，团结全国人民，在继续完成整风运动的基础上，贯彻执行这条社会主义建设的总路线。这次大会的另一个内容是通过了关于共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议的决议。决议完全支持莫斯科宣言，并且指出：“同各国兄弟党一起，在政治上和理论上彻底粉碎现代修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上的统一，是我们党对国际工人阶级的神圣义务。”大会还基本通过了全国农业发展纲要第二次修正草案，委托中央委员会根据今年的实行情况再作必要的修改，提交第二届全国人民代表大会通过公布。大会号召全党同志同五亿农民一起和全国人民一起，为提前实现这个纲要而努力。
    党的八届二次大会所制定的社会主义建设的总路线，是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义、正确地总结我国社会主义建设的经验的结果。如果说，党的第八届全国代表大会第一次会议主要是总结了社会主义改造的经验，那末，第二次会议主要是总结了整风运动和社会主义建设的经验。这次会议能够总结社会主义建设经验，并且提出和通过了社会主义建设的总路线，是由于经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经基本上完成，党已经有可能把主要力量集中到社会主义建设方面来，而我国的建设工作也已经有了八年的历史，特别是在最近三年中取得了高潮——低潮——更大的高潮这样一个马鞍形发展的教训。经过这次大会，党和人民获得了统一思想、统一步调的锐利武器，这对于今后我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，无疑将产生伟大的作用。
    党的社会主义建设总路线，正确地反映了我国人民的最大利益和迫切要求，也体现了我们共产党人的革命气概和对于人民群众的高度信任。在我们的国家里，要不要建设社会主义的问题已经解决了。摆在面前的问题是采取怎样的方针进行社会主义建设：究竟要不要鼓足干劲、力争上游呢？要不要、能不能把事情办得快些好些呢？在有些人看来，我国建设只能慢些、差些，不能快些、好些。他们有种种理由：什么人口太多啦，经济文化太落后啦，农业长不上来啦，资金和技术力量不足啦，外国的速度也只有那样高啦，如此等等。这些人跟资产阶级右派不同，他们是要建设社会主义的，只是他们的精神不够振作，反映了由于我们民族长期被压迫而遗留下来的自卑心理。他们只觉得自己矮得很，别人才是丈二金刚。他们不知道，解放了的、觉悟了的、团结起来和组织起来的六亿多人口，这才是世界上最伟大的创造力量，有了这个力量，就能够有最多的资金和最大的技术力量，就能够有工业和农业的高速度发展，就能够做到人类所能够做到的一切。在伟大的中国和以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营面前，什么美国英国，什么帝国主义阵营，真正不过是一些侏儒罢了。我国的经济文化还很落后，但是正因为这样，我国人民对于加速进行社会主义建设的积极性特别巨大。党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，正是集中体现了我国人民对于尽早摆脱经济落后和文化落后的迫切要求，表现了我国人民的大无畏精神和势如破竹的气概。我们党深信，只要鼓足六亿多人民的干劲，动员六亿多人民力争上游，我们就一定能够高速度地进行建设，一定能够在一个比较短的时间内赶上一切资本主义国家，成为世界上最先进、最富强的国家之一。人们看到，正是在经济落后文化落后的中国，人民革命的发展速度和规模远远超过了欧美所有经济发达、文化发达的资本主义国家。为什么我国在建设的速度和规模方面不能同样远远地超过它们呢？我们在任何时候都反对骄傲自大，但是自卑和自大同样是我们所必须抛弃的低级趣味。目前我国广大群众在全民整风和建设高潮中，已经表现出一种破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢说、敢作敢为的高尚风格。我们应该发扬这种共产主义的风格，使之成为全党的风格，全民族的风格。这是实现总路线的关键。
    党的社会主义建设的总路线的基本出发点既然是相信群众的力量和反映群众的意志，那末，实现这条总路线的基本方法，也必然是群众路线的方法。我们的国家是又穷又白，我们的建设要又多又快又好又省，这是一个矛盾。解决这个矛盾的唯一方法，就是依靠群众。总路线规定工业和农业同时并举，就是为了发挥五亿农民的积极性，为工业提供最大的市场，更多的资金和更多的原料。中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，就是为了使全国二十几个省、直辖市和自治区，一百八十多个专区、二千多个县、八万多个乡、十万多个手工业合作社和七十多万个农业合作社，都能够充分发挥发展工业的积极性，使企业更加接近群众，更加便于充分地发掘群众的潜力。党所号召的技术革命和文化革命，同经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命一样，都必须是群众性的运动。而整风运动的深入，大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法的普及，官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气的克服，在领导工作中种试验田、跟班劳动、参观评比、抓两头带中间等项方法的推广，这些都是为了正确处理人民内部矛盾，为了充分地发挥群众的积极性。目前全国各地工农业生产跃进，地方工业遍地开花，农具改良运动和技术革新运动蓬勃发展，扫盲运动、民办中小学、以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动成效显著，都有力地证明了：由于贯彻执行群众路线，人民群众的聪明才智得到了充分的发挥，已经产生了无穷无尽的伟大力量。毛泽东同志曾经一再教导我们，群众路线是党的一切工作的根本路线。党的社会主义建设总路线，正如刘少奇同志的报告所说，是群众路线在社会主义建设事业中的应用和发展。在一切工作中运用这个路线，一定能够保证社会主义建设事业进行得又多又快又好又省。
    在党的路线已经确定以后，全党的任务，全国人民中一切积极分子的任务，就是贯彻执行这条路线，把总路线的红旗插遍全国，使总路线的灯塔照耀全国人民的一切工作。目前，全民整风运动已经取得了伟大的胜利，党内的团结和全民团结已经大大增强，各项建设事业都处在跃进的高潮中。这一切都是使人高兴的。但是这决不是说，在我们的工作中已经没有缺点、没有困难了，总路线的实现已经不会再有曲折，不再需要艰苦的奋斗了。我们是革命的乐观主义者，同时又是革命的现实主义者。我们必须在工作顺利的情况下看到我们工作中存在的各种缺点和困难，还要预计到一切可能发生的困难，预计到可能发生的意外事件。总路线要求我国尽快地建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，为了把这个伟大的理想变为现实，还需要全党和全国人民付出严重的努力。全党干部必须沿着又红又专的道路顽强地学习；学习业务，学习政治，学习正确的思想方法、正确的工作方法和工作作风。我们必须学会把辩证唯物主义运用到一切实际工作中去，学会把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，把严肃的原则精神同生动活泼的创造精神相结合。我们全党同志应当在整风运动的基础上，进一步深入地学习毛泽东同志的著作，大大提高我们党的政治思想水平和理论水平，以便胜利地实现党的社会主义建设总路线。
