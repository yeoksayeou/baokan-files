    Sanyuanli Elementary School in the Suburbs of Guangzhou
    Conducts Revolutionary Tradition Education for Children
    (Our Dispatch) Sanyuanli Elementary School in the suburbs of Guangzhou regularly conducts revolutionary tradition education for children.

    Sanyuanli is a place with a revolutionary tradition. As far back as 117 years ago in May, local farmers organized the "Pingying Tuan" (Brigade to Quell the British), gathering tens of thousands of people from more than one hundred neighboring villages to resist the invasion of British imperialism. The elementary school students studying at Sanyuanli Elementary School today are mostly descendants of those who participated in the anti-imperialist struggle at that time. In addition to regularly listening to their elders recount the heroic struggle history of the "Pingying Tuan" and receiving revolutionary tradition education, the Young Pioneers in the school also often invite local elders to specifically tell the story of the anti-British struggle that year.

    In addition to conducting local revolutionary tradition education for children, the school also leads them to Guangzhou to meet Comrade Du Shufa, who participated in the Long March, and listen to him recount his personal experience of the heroic struggle of fighting hard on the Qilian Mountains for thirty-seven days and nights.

    May 30th is the 117th anniversary of the Sanyuanli "Pingying Tuan's" anti-British struggle. On this day, Sanyuanli Elementary School is preparing to hold a comprehensive military camping commemoration on the square in front of the monument. (He Jianping)

    广州市郊三元里小学
    对儿童进行革命传统教育
    本报讯　广州市郊三元里小学经常对儿童进行革命传统教育。
    三元里是一个具有革命传统的地方。远在一百一十七年前的5月，当地农民组织了“平英团”，聚集了邻近一百多个乡的几万人，在这里抗击英帝国主义的侵略。现在三元里小学读书的小学生，他们大多是当时参加反帝斗争者的后代，他们除了经常听长辈讲述“平英团”的英勇斗争历史，接受革命传统教育外，学校里的少先队，也常常邀请当地的父老专门讲述当年抗英斗争的故事。
    学校除了对儿童进行乡土的革命传统教育外，还带领他们到广州会见了曾参加长征的杜树发同志，听他讲述亲身参加祁连山苦战三十七昼夜的英勇斗争事迹。
    5月30日是三元里“平英团”抗英斗争一百一十七周年纪念日，在这一天里，三元里小学准备在纪念碑前的广场上举行综合性的军事露营纪念。　（何剑萍）
