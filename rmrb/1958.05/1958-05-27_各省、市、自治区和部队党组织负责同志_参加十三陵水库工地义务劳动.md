Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Our reporter reports: Leading comrades of Party organizations of provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and military units, who are participating in the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, joined Chairman Mao and other leading comrades of the Party Central Committee in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site yesterday. When they arrived at the construction site, the builders of the reservoir expressed a warm welcome and said excitedly: "The people of the whole country are here to support us in building the reservoir. We must work even harder."

Initially, the builders of the reservoir, out of concern for the health of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and the responsible comrades of the local Party committees, did not want them to participate in the labor and said earnestly: "Your presence here is the greatest encouragement to us!" However, the responsible comrades of the local Party committees, like the leading comrades of the Central Committee, joined the ranks of the reservoir builders as soon as they arrived in front of the reservoir dam and began to work hard. Sometimes they lined up in long rows to pass earth, sometimes they participated in leveling and carrying earth, and some even drove soil compactors to compact the earth.

Comrades Ke Qingshi, Li Jingquan, and others took off their coats as soon as they arrived at the construction site and kept shoveling and transporting earth. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, fearing that they were working too hard, came to replace them to rest, but none of them would agree, saying: "It doesn't matter, we are the same as everyone else."

Marshals Ye Jianying and Nie Rongzhen also worked with the soldiers yesterday. Jiang Weiqing and Zhong Qiguang met old comrades-in-arms from more than a decade ago at the construction site – officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who are currently serving in the construction of the reservoir. During the break, the officers and soldiers reported to their old superiors on the achievements of the troops in building the reservoir and expressed their determination to exert greater efforts to ensure that the reservoir is completed before the flood season.

Comrade Wang Zhen, who led the development of Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, and Comrade Wang Enmao participated in carrying earth shoulder to shoulder. Comrade Wang Enmao rolled up his trouser legs above his knees and worked vigorously, carrying a lot and running fast. People praised him as "the model worker here!" Comrade Wang Zhen also drove a soil compactor back and forth to compact the soil.

After Comrade Chen Xilian arrived at the construction site, a pair of baskets never left his shoulders, and people called him a "labor expert." When the members of the cultural troupe who were performing voluntary labor at the construction site gave a consolation performance for the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the responsible comrades from various regions, Comrade Chen Xilian worked even harder. He even danced the yangko while carrying his load.

Yesterday, Lin Tie, Tao Lujia, Huang Huoqing, Ouyang Qin, Wu De, Zeng Xisheng, Jiang Hua, Shu Tong, Wu Zhipu, Wang Renzhong, Tao Zhu, Shao Shiping, Xie Fuzhi, Zhang Desheng, Zhang Zhongliang, Gao Feng, Wang Feng, Zhou Xiaozhou, Liu Jianxun, Ye Fei, Saifudin, Sangji Yuexi, Zhou Lin and other responsible comrades of local Party committees, all participated in voluntary labor. Everyone was full of energy.

The participation of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and the responsible comrades of the local Party committees in voluntary labor greatly boosted the morale of the reservoir builders. On this day alone, the reservoir builders filled more than 51,000 cubic meters of earth for the reservoir dam, setting a new record since the start of the reservoir project.

    各省、市、自治区和部队党组织负责同志
    参加十三陵水库工地义务劳动
    新华社26日讯　本社记者报道：参加中共“八大”第二次会议的各省、市、自治区和部队党组织的负责同志在昨天同毛主席和党中央的领导同志一起，到十三陵水库工地参加了义务劳动。当他们到达工地的时候，水库的建设者表示热烈欢迎，并且兴奋地说：全国人民都来支援我们修水库了，我们一定要加倍地努力干。
  开始，水库的建设者们为了照顾党中央领导同志和各地党委负责同志的健康，不让他们参加劳动，并且恳切地说：“你们来到这里，就是对我们的最大鼓舞！”但是，各地党委负责同志同中央领导同志一样，一到水库的大坝前面就站到水库建设者的行列里，进行紧张劳动。他们有时排成长长的行列进行传土，有时参加平土和挑土，还有的人开着压土机压土。
    柯庆施、李井泉等同志，一到工地就脱下了外衣，不停地铲土和运土，解放军战士怕他们过分劳累，跑来替换他们去休息，他们谁也不肯，他们说：“没有关系，我们和大家一样。”
    叶剑英和聂荣臻元帅昨天也和战士们一起劳动。江渭清和锺期光在工地上，恰好会见了十几年前的老战友——正在担任水库建设的解放军某部的军官和战士们。休息的时候，军官和战士们向自己的老上级汇报了部队在修水库中的成绩，并且表示要发挥更大的干劲，保证在汛期前把水库修好。
    曾在抗日战争期间领导开辟陕北南泥湾的王震同志和王恩茂同志肩并肩地参加挑土。王恩茂同志把裤管卷过膝盖以上，一股劲地干，担的多，跑得快，人们称赞他是“我们这里的劳动模范！”王震同志还开着压土机往返压土。
    陈锡联同志到了工地以后，一副筐担从没有离开过他的肩膀，人们称他为“劳动能手”。当在工地进行义务劳动的文工团员们为中央领导同志和各地负责同志作慰问演出时，陈锡联同志干劲更足，他挑着担子还扭起了秧歌舞。
    昨天，林铁、陶鲁笳、黄火青、欧阳钦、吴德、曾希圣、江华、舒同、吴芝圃、王任重、陶铸、邵式平、谢富治、张德生、张仲良、高峰、汪锋、周小舟、刘建勋、叶飞、赛福鼎、桑吉悦希、周林等各地党委负责同志，都参加了义务劳动。他们每个人都干劲十足。
    党中央领导同志和各地党委责负同志参加义务劳动，大大鼓舞了水库的建设者们的干劲。就在这一天水库建设者们为水库坝身填筑了五万一千多土方，创造了水库工程开工以来的最高纪录。
