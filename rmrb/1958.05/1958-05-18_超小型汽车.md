　　Ultra-Small Car
　　China's first novel, beautiful, light, and fuel-efficient ultra-small car has recently been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Xiangjiang Machine Factory.

　　This car looks like a streamlined small boat, less than six feet long and only three feet wide, and it is very light; two people can lift it. Not only is its appearance special, but its structure is also different from ordinary small cars or motorcycles. General three-wheeled motorcycles have one front wheel and two rear wheels; this car has two front wheels and one rear wheel. General small cars have front-wheel steering and rear-wheel drive; this car has rear-wheel steering and one front-wheel drive. Although the car body is light and small, it can carry four people. It consumes very little fuel, only equivalent to a two-wheeled motorcycle.

　　Ultra-small cars, also known as micro-cars, are a type of vehicle between small cars and motorcycles. Its engine and economic performance are similar to motorcycles, but its appearance and performance are similar to small cars (or light trucks). Its cost is very low, close to that of a motorcycle.

    超小型汽车
    我国第一辆新颖、美观、轻便、省油的超小型汽车，最近在国营湘江机器厂试制成功。
    这辆汽车外形像一艘流线型小艇，长不到六尺，宽才三尺，重量很轻，两个人就能抬动。不仅外形特殊，它的结构也跟一般小轿车或摩托车不同。一般三轮摩托车是一个前轮，两个后轮；这辆车是两个前轮，一个后轮。一般小轿车是前轮转向，后轮驱动；这辆车是后轮转向，一个前轮驱动。车身虽然又轻又小，却能乘四个人。它耗油很少，只相当于一辆双轮摩托车。
    超小型汽车又叫微型汽车，是介于小轿车和摩托车之间的一种车型。它的发动机部分及经济性能同摩托车近似，但外形和使用性能则同小轿车（或轻型载货车）相似。它的造价很低，成本和摩托车相近。
