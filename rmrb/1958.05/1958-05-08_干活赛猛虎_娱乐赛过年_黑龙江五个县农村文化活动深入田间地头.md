　　Working Like Tigers, Enjoying Like New Year
　　Rural Cultural Activities in Five Counties of Heilongjiang Extend Deep into the Fields

　　(Our dispatch) Reporter Jiao Huadong reports: Rural cultural activities in Ning'an, Qinggang, Zhaozhou, Hailun, and Bin County of Heilongjiang Province are extending into the fields along with the current intense spring plowing and sowing. During breaks, a lively and vibrant scene appears everywhere. Most villages have achieved a situation where every commune has a club, every team has a cultural center, members read newspapers every day, listen to the radio every night, have evening parties during festivals, and have songs everywhere. In these ordinary rural areas, there are amateur drama troupes, singing teams, broadcasting groups, reading groups, writing groups, sports teams, slide shows, blackboard newspapers, libraries, agricultural science research groups, or agricultural science and technology lectures organized by the masses. Generally, more than half of the young men and women members have become the backbone and active members of these cultural activities, and men, women, old and young are enthusiastic audiences and listeners. In particular, the local drama "Errenzhuan," which is loved by farmers in Northeast China, as well as Yangko dances, clapper talks, comic dialogues, and small-scale singing performances are performed on the ground, which are most popular among the masses. The writing groups of rural clubs often adopt many forms that farmers love to see and hear to encourage the farmers' production enthusiasm. Some have adapted the tune of the Northeast folk song "Liang Shanbo Fifty" into lyrics such as "Start work early, finish work late, compete to be heroes under the moon," and "Effort can be exerted, sweat can be shed, the 7,000-jin commune cannot be abandoned." Wang Jiuhe, a member of the Tongli Commune in Qinggang County, said happily: "Now it's working like tigers and enjoying like New Year!"

　　After these five counties popularized rural cultural activities, they not only promoted production but also improved the political consciousness of the peasants and consolidated the achievements of eliminating illiteracy. The Yulin Township Central Club in Ning'an County, through activities such as performing plays, copying lyrics, and reading manuscripts, not only consolidated the achievements of literacy but also greatly improved the farmers' culture. They wrote scripts such as "Learning Culture," "The Whole Family Goes to Civil School," "A Letter," and "Engaging in Sideline Occupations," and performed them among the masses.

　　The Heilongjiang Provincial Cultural Bureau recently proposed concrete measures at a cultural Great Leap Forward promotion meeting, requiring all other 50+ counties in the province to popularize rural cultural activities this year.

    干活赛猛虎　娱乐赛过年
    黑龙江五个县农村文化活动深入田间地头
    本报讯　记者焦化东报道：黑龙江省宁安、青冈、肇州、海伦、宾县五个县的农村文化活动，正随着当前紧张的春耕播种深入到田间地头。一到休息时候，到处出现一片生动活泼景象。大部分乡村作到了社社有俱乐部，队队有文化室，社员天天读书报，夜夜听广播，年节有晚会，处处有歌声。在这些普通的农村里有群众组织起来的业余剧团、歌咏队、广播组、读报组、创作组、球队、幻灯、黑板报、图书室、农业科学研究组或农业科学技术讲座，普遍有一半以上的青年男女社员成为这些文化活动的骨干分子和活动分子，男女老少都是热心的观众和听众。尤其是东北农民喜爱的地方戏“二人转”，秧歌剧、快板、相声、小演唱，在地头演出，最受群众欢迎。农村俱乐部的创作组常常采用许多农民喜闻乐见的形式鼓舞农民的生产情绪。有的按照东北民歌“梁山伯五十”的调子编成“早动工，晚收工，月亮底下比英雄”，“力可出，汗可流，七千斤社不可丢”的唱词。青冈县同立社社员王久和高兴地说：“现在是干活赛猛虎，娱乐赛过年哪！”
    这五个县普及了农村文化活动以后，不仅推动了生产，而且提高了农民的政治觉悟，也巩固了扫除文盲的成果。宁安县的榆林乡中心俱乐部通过演剧、抄词、念稿等活动，不仅巩固了扫盲成果，而且使农民文化有很大提高，他们编写了“学文化”、“全家上民校”、“一封信”、“搞副业”等剧本，在群众中演出。
    黑龙江省文化局最近召开的文化大跃进促进会上提出具体措施，全省其余五十多个县都要在今年普及农村文化活动。
