    Amidst the Sounds of Gongs and Drums
    Worker of Factory 541, Li Xue'ao
      The Old Reporter
    Old reporter, you're really great,
    You can write articles, you can take photographs.
    The articles you write are fantastic,
    The photographs you take seem to come alive.
    Today you come to the factory,
    Specifically to interview about the "Great Leap Forward."
    Some say
    Workshop One's Great Leap Forward is the best.
    Some say
    Workshop Two's achievements are the strongest.
    Some say
    Workshop Three has already won the "Superior Banner."
    Some say
    Workshop Four has already climbed onto the "Roll of Honor."...
    Here, the sound of gongs hasn't faded,
    There, the sound of drums starts again.
    Which shots to choose? Which shots to choose?
    Experienced reporter,
    Standing at the crossroads, you've lost your direction!
    The Victory Announcing Team
    Dong beng qiang! Dong beng qiang!
    A thousand people dance,
    Ten thousand people sing,
    Happily on the road.
    Dancing makes the "Blue Arrow" fall to the ground,
    Dancing makes the "Red Arrow" shoot to the sky.
    [Note] Red arrow represents productivity, blue arrow represents the reject rate.

    锣鼓声中
    541工厂工人  李学鳌
      老记者
    老记者，真叫棒，
    能写稿，能照像。
    写的文章呱呱叫，
    照的像片似活样。
    今天到工厂，
    专把“跃进”来采访。
    有人说
    一车间跃进的最好。
    有人说
    二车间的成绩最强。
    有人说
    三车间已获“优胜旗”。
    有人说
    四车间已登“英雄榜”。……
    这边，锣声未落，
    那边，鼓声又响。
    选哪些镜头？选哪些镜头？
    老练的记者啊，
    站在路口，没了主张！
    报喜队
    咚嘣呛！咚嘣呛！
    千人跳，
    万人唱，
    欢欢乐乐在路上。
    跳得“蓝箭”入了地，
    跳得“红箭”射天上。
    〔注〕红箭代表生产率，蓝箭代表废品率。
