Hasten to Select and Retain Summer Harvest Crop Seeds
Ministry of Agriculture Issues Notice to All Regions

(By our newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice to all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities in early May regarding the selection, retention, evaluation and procurement of fine seeds for summer harvest crops. The notice pointed out: This year, the area of land converted to new systems has expanded, and the amount of seeding has increased, leading to a general shortage of varieties and seeds in all provinces. Although a large number of seeds have been transferred between and within provinces, some of the transferred seeds are mixed, some have low germination rates, and the varieties are not entirely suitable. In order to better adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, fundamental arrangements must be made in this regard in the future. The notice requires all regions to do the following three tasks:

    (1) Launch a widespread mass movement for selecting and retaining seeds. Agricultural cooperatives are required to "select seeds in every cooperative and retain seeds of all kinds," selecting and retaining enough high-quality seeds to meet the needs of the next season and the coming year. Agricultural cooperatives with increased production should also retain more backup seeds.

    (2) In conjunction with the seed selection and retention movement, conduct a general evaluation of fine seeds. The evaluation work can be carried out at the township level, with townships conducting evaluations and counties reviewing them. Attention should also be paid to the combination of varieties during the review of varieties.

    (3) Strengthen the procurement of fine seeds. Provinces (autonomous regions), municipalities, and counties should all plan to procure a sufficient quantity of fine seeds for transfer and adjustment.

The notice concluded: The summer harvest is about to begin, and time is pressing. All regions should immediately deploy, supervise, and inspect this work.

　　赶快选留夏熟作物种子
    农业部向各地发出通知
    本报讯　农业部5月上旬向各省（区）、市发出关于作好夏收作物的选种、留种和良种的评选、收购工作的通知。通知指出：今年改制面积扩大，播种量增多，各省普遍发生品种不够、种子不足情况。各省省间和省内虽然调剂了大量种子，但所调种子有的很杂，有的发芽率不高，品种也不尽适合。为了更好地适应农业生产大跃进的需要，今后必须在这方面进行根本安排。通知要求各地区作好下面三项工作：
      （1）普遍开展一个群众性的选种、留种运动。要求农业社“社社选种、样样留种”，选好留够下季和明年足够需要的优良种子。增产的农业社，还要多留一部分后备种子。
      （2）结合选种留种运动，普遍开展良种的评选工作。评选工作，可以以乡为单位，乡乡评选，由县审查。在审查品种中并要注意品种的搭配。
      （3）加强良种收购工作。省（区）、市和县都应当有计划地收购足够数量的良种，用作调剂。
    通知最后指出：夏收已将开始，时间紧迫。各地应当立即布置和督促检查这项工作。
