Politics Takes Command, The Whole People Mobilize, Quick Victory, Complete Annihilation of the Four Pests
Wang Molin, Secretary of the Shizhong District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province

(I)
Last year, the Party Central Committee announced the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, and Chairman Mao once again instructed the great significance of eliminating the four pests at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, clearly including the elimination of the four pests and paying attention to hygiene in the program of transforming the country. The people of Chongqing, like the people of the whole country, were greatly encouraged. At the same time, through the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of the people has been greatly improved, and their political enthusiasm and work enthusiasm have soared unprecedentedly. Under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a massive mass patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests was rapidly launched throughout the city. More than two million people in the city, regardless of men, women, old or young, worked day and night, and with the fighting posture of overwhelming mountains and seas, used the energy of the Huaihai Campaign to wipe out more than 5.7 million rats, more than 657,000 sparrows, and more than 97,000 catties of flies and fly pupae, and more than 8,200 catties of mosquitoes and their larvae. For a time, rats and sparrows disappeared, and mosquitoes and flies were rarely seen. The four pests have been basically eliminated.

In this annihilation battle to eliminate the four pests, under the specific instructions of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, we adopted the battle policy of putting politics in command, mobilizing the whole people, achieving a quick victory, and carrying out a comprehensive encirclement and annihilation from the sky and the ground. For rats, we adopted the method of cutting off water and food for three days, then applying poisoned bait, so that the rats were hungry and thirsty, dizzy and dazed, prompting them to eat whatever they saw, and die as soon as they ate it. At the same time, we coordinated with various tools to catch and fight, and used sulfur smoke to fumigate the sewers. We also carried out the work of turning over warehouses, food stores, haystacks, digging rat holes, destroying rat nests, and destroying rat houses, and laid down a dragnet to make it impossible for rats to escape. For sparrows, we adopted "fatigue tactics," scaring and chasing, shooting with gunpowder guns, encircling on three sides and closing in with iron walls, leaving gaps, luring them to pre-arranged positions, and carrying out poisoning and shooting, and catching them with nets at night. At the same time, we copied the sparrow nests and removed all the sparrows' "household registrations" to prevent them from settling down, making it impossible for them to live, and difficult for them to fly. For mosquitoes and flies, we eliminated all their breeding grounds, filled in pits and puddles, dredged ditches, managed feces, cleared weeds around households, dug out fly pupae, used wild plants such as five-petal clouds, broken gut grass, duck footboards, and broken bowl flowers to kill manure maggots, sprayed medicine, smoked, and captured adult flies and mosquitoes. At the same time, we adopted the method of hitting whoever saw them, and hitting one to eliminate one, so that they would have no offspring. On the basis of making all preparations for battle, Shizhong District of Chongqing City put forward the battle slogan of fighting hard for seven days and nights, and not letting rats spend the Spring Festival, and more than 500,000 people in the district started working and went into battle, and completed the task of annihilating rats as scheduled. After the pilot project in Shizhong District, the Municipal Party Committee decided to change the "Four Pests" Elimination Headquarters in Shizhong District into the general headquarters of the city, and at the same time put forward to the people of the city the battle call of fighting hard for ten days and nights and not letting "Four Pests" spend the Lantern Festival. The masses were very energetic, and they did what they said. In ten days and nights, they realized the battle task of basically eliminating the four pests in the city.

The Municipal Party Committee's determination was great, and the masses were full of energy. Things that could not be done for many years in the past were completed in a short time, even a few days. In order to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, the masses eliminated several large garbage dumps that had accumulated for more than 30 years. The sludge ditches that had not been dug for more than 30 years were renovated. Twelve thousand large and small ditches were dredged, adding more than 600,000 feet. Chongqing has a sewage pond called Coral Dam, which was left over from history. It covers an area of 200,000 square meters and is the largest stinky pond in Chongqing. The stench is overflowing, and everyone covers their noses and passes by. The masses call this sewage pond a big manure pond, which is the main camp for mosquitoes and flies to breed and reproduce. Many engineering and technical personnel believe that it is an engineering project that cannot be solved in a short time. This time, the masses used 300,000 person-times of voluntary labor and 21 days to dig more than 100,000 cubic meters of cobblestones and dug a canal 2,500 meters long to draw water from the Yangtze River to flush the sewage pond, turning the stagnant water into living water and the sewage pond into a clear pond. From then on, nearby residents will no longer smell the stench. There are more than 300 sewer outlets and sewage ditches in Chongqing, and there are nine larger sewer outlets, forming large sewage waterfalls hanging on steep cliffs. Under the rocks are sludge and stinky water puddles, which are not only breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, but also seriously affect the urban environment and sanitation. In order to completely change this situation, we built more than 40 kilometers of comprehensive sewers, and merged 313 sewer outlets and sewage ditches into 16, directly introducing the sewage into the heart of the river. In the past, some engineering and technical personnel surveyed this project several times, and proposed that the investment needed was 15 million to 20 million yuan, and the design and construction time would take more than two to three years to complete. This time, with a bold leap forward, only 360,000 yuan was actually used, and it was completed in 20 days and nights. Shizhong District used 18 days to build and renovate 85 public toilets and mass-owned toilets, eliminating the open-air cesspools in the urban area, and set up more than 40 mobile toilets (which can be moved during floods) along the river, solving the problem of defecation for boat people, and eliminating the phenomenon of urinating and defecating everywhere. All of the more than 400 toilets that were not connected to the sewers were connected to the sewers. At present, there is not a single toilet in the urban area that is not connected to the sewers, and you can no longer see the burdens and carts of carrying feces that affect the appearance and sanitation of the city. At the same time, the vegetable market was rectified and purified, the street vendors were cleared, and the slaughterhouses, breeding farms, leather factories, casing factories, and chicken and duck processing factories that affected the sanitation of the urban area were all moved out of Shizhong District, which fundamentally changed the sanitation of the urban area.

In many areas such as Wangjiapo and Guanjingxiang, the door panels, wooden walls, and roof beams were all scraped clean with knives or glass shards, and were spotless. All the communes in the suburbs have covered all the manure pits, abolished private manure pits, and established courtyard public toilets and garbage stations, separating human and animal manure pits. More than 90% of Ma Wu Township and other places have achieved that every household has a spittoon, every household uses serving chopsticks, everyone has a face towel, and everyone has a toothbrush. All households in the city have whitewashed the walls and facades, and spittoons and fruit peel boxes have been set up everywhere on the streets and alleys. Generally, a regular patriotic health system has been established, a patriotic health convention has been formulated, a regional responsibility system has been established, a front-of-door and front-of-stall responsibility system has been established, and a regular mutual inspection and evaluation system has been established. A resolution was made at the District People's Congress, and interim measures for health management in various industries were formulated. Generally, "four no's" and "eight clean's" have been achieved: no spitting anywhere, no dumping garbage anywhere, no urinating and defecating anywhere, and no throwing melon peels, fruit shells, and paper scraps randomly. Personal body is clean, clothes are clean, bedding is clean, eating utensils are clean, indoor and outdoor are clean, courtyard is clean, streets and alleys are clean, and public places are clean. The people have begun to develop good habits of being clean and paying attention to hygiene, making Chongqing clean and tidy everywhere, and the sanitation outlook has been completely renewed.

The above facts show that after the masses are mobilized, many major events have been done with less money or no money, old habits have been changed, new trends have been established, and things that were difficult for predecessors to imagine have been done. Once again, it proves that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority and vitality, and proves that once the broad masses of the people are awakened and realize that they are the masters of the new society, they will create amazing miracles.

In this battle, many advanced deeds and advanced figures have also emerged. They have driven the masses and inspired everyone's determination to eliminate the four pests. Rat-catching experts Heng Yongfeng and Li Chaoqun used iron to kill ditch rats, each killing more than 5,000. Worker Shi Yunfu alone used a fire gun to eliminate more than 3,000 sparrows. After the experience of shop assistant Zhang Zhiyou in poisoning rats in toilets was promoted, more than 4,670 rats were exterminated overnight in more than 200 public toilets in Shizhong District. Coal miner Zhao Shuyun saw a rat escape into the river, and jumped into the water without hesitation to catch the escaped rat. The old lady with bound feet, who was more than 60 years old, was as good as the young people at digging pupae and ditches. The Young Pioneer's health supervision post shouted along the street with a megaphone, "Uncle and Aunt (Aunt), don't eat snacks while walking (meaning eating snacks while walking). It's a bad habit to spit anywhere. It's not only unhygienic but also ugly." The popular cheerleading words supervise pedestrians to abide by public health. There are many such moving scenes. At the same time, through this battle, the revolutionary aspirations of the broad masses and their confidence in accelerating socialist construction have been inspired by the great achievements they have created. They said, "We can eliminate the 'four pests' in the sky and on the ground. What other difficulties can't we overcome? What else can't we do well?"

(II)
The achievements we have made in eliminating the four pests have not been smooth sailing. There have been many ideological struggles in this process. At the beginning of the movement, there were different views on whether the elimination of the "four pests" could be accelerated. One attitude was that it was possible to eliminate the "four pests" in the short term, and there were sufficient conditions. They saw that after the socialist education movement of rectification, the masses had a high political consciousness and enthusiasm, and the national great leap forward situation was inspiring. Cadres and the masses had full revolutionary energy. As long as they believed in the masses and relied on the masses to fully mobilize the masses, they would definitely be able to do it. This is an active revolutionary promotion attitude. Another attitude was the opposite. They underestimated the power of the masses and thought it could not be done. Comrades who held this attitude started from empiricism and believed that the struggle to eliminate the "four pests" had been carried out in the past few years, and there had been considerable achievements, but the four pests had not been eliminated. They believed that the large-scale and widespread use of poisoned bait was a risky behavior. "If the rats are not poisoned to death, a few people will be poisoned to death. I don't know how to explain it!" Therefore, the advanced and conservative, fast and slow methods launched a debate. After a great debate, the conservative idea that did not believe in the power of the masses to eliminate the four pests was criticized. Everyone made it clear that since the "four pests" are objective things, people must be able to find out their characteristics and activity rules to eliminate them. The characteristics of the four pests are wide distribution, large quantity, and fast reproduction (in Chongqing, a female rat gives birth to seven to ten litters a year, with seven to twelve in each litter, and the young rats can become pregnant two months after birth). The method of taking small hands and small feet, scattered operations, single-handed work by each household, and fragmented and piecemeal strikes will inevitably lead to a situation of birth after destruction, running east and west, and side destruction and side birth, or more births than destructions. The reason why the "four pests" have not been eliminated in the past few years is precisely this reason. Regarding the problem of a large amount of poisoned bait being released in every household, as long as we rely on mass activists to teach the masses the technology and precautions, and combine the masses' enthusiasm for eliminating the "four pests" with technical guidance, we can adopt the method of activists being responsible for specific areas, assigning areas to each household, and releasing the poison bait at night after the poultry is caged, the livestock is in the pen, and the children are in bed, before the rats start their activities, and in the morning, before the poultry and livestock come out and the children wake up, the remaining poison bait that the rats have not eaten is collected and kept by special personnel. A special "antuo" poison bait is used for households with danger (counter-revolutionaries, rightists, landlords, rich peasants, and couples who quarrel). It is also stipulated that the amount released should not exceed eight pills (this medicine will kill rats if they eat it, and people will vomit if they eat it). The actual proof is that by handing over the technology to the masses and relying on the masses, no one has died. Starting from this objective fact, it is very necessary and entirely possible to adopt the battle policy of mobilizing the whole people, short-term surprise attacks, quick battles and quick victories, unified command, unified action, and comprehensive encirclement and annihilation, and winning a complete victory in one battle. In the face of the complete victory in the elimination of the four pests, those who do not believe in the complete elimination of the "four pests" in a short time cannot but admit that their understanding is wrong. Another attitude is to regard the elimination of the four pests as opposed to production. If you want to do a good job in production, you can't do a good job in eliminating the "four pests." He especially believes that such a large-scale, nationwide, unified action will affect production and hinder production. In fact, this understanding is also wrong. In fact, eliminating the "four pests" is only good for production. If the elimination of the four pests and attention to hygiene are done well, diseases will be reduced, the health of workers will be guaranteed, and spirits will be boosted, which can promote a great leap forward in production. For example, after Chongqing Xinhua Printing Factory did a good job in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, the incidence of disease among workers and their families decreased by 40% compared with the same period in previous years, and the attendance rate increased. Due to the cleanliness and tidiness of the workshop and the cleaning of the machines, the workers' production enthusiasm was high and their spirits were full, and both output and quality were greatly improved. Chongqing Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory cleared more than 170 tons of large drug residue piles that had accumulated year by year, which not only eliminated mosquito and fly breeding grounds, but also increased the drug liquid by 30% to 40% by pressing the drug residue after workers' research. The pressed dry drug residue is seeped into the coal as fuel, which can reduce coal consumption by 0.2% per month, saving the country a total of 100,000 yuan per year. After further research by technicians, a new product, oxalic acid, can be extracted from the drug residue. Sanitation has been improved in breeding farms and pig plague has been eliminated. Rat infestations have been eliminated from chicken and duck egg warehouses, reducing losses of chicken and duck eggs by about 90 kg per month. The management of garbage to produce granular fertilizer has supported agricultural production. Facts have proved that eliminating the "four pests" and paying attention to hygiene not only guarantees the people's health, but also promotes increased production and savings. In this way, the work of eliminating the "four pests" and paying attention to hygiene in various production enterprises and units has also been universally consolidated.

×　×　×
Although we have made some achievements in the work of eliminating the four pests, the effectiveness of many tasks has not yet been tested for a long time. For example, our measures to eradicate mosquitoes and flies still need to be tested for a summer. To eradicate the "four pests", we still need a lot of regular and meticulous work. Therefore, we must, in the spirit of eliminating harm and eradicating roots, make persistent efforts to eliminate the remnants of the four pests, and not give up until it is clean. At the same time, we must adhere to the patriotic health system on a regular and lasting basis and cultivate the habits of the masses.

    政治挂帅　全民动员  速战速决　全歼四害
    中共四川省重庆市市中区区委书记　王墨林
    （一）
    去年党中央公布了全国农业发展纲要修正草案，毛主席在八届三中全会上再一次的指示除四害的重大意义，明确的把除四害讲卫生列入改造国家的纲领之中。重庆人民和全国人民一样受到了极大的鼓舞。同时经过整风运动，人民群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，政治积极性和工作热情空前高涨。在市委的直接领导下，一个声势浩大的、以除四害为中心的群众性的爱国卫生运动，迅速地在全市开展起来。全市两百多万人民不分男女老幼夜以继日地一齐动手，以排山倒海的战斗姿态，用了打淮海战役的干劲，一举歼灭老鼠五百七十多万只，歼灭麻雀六十五万七千多只，消灭苍蝇及蝇蛹九万七千多斤，蚊子及其幼虫八千二百多斤，一时鼠雀绝迹，蚊蝇难见，已基本消灭了四害。
    除四害这一歼灭战，我们是在省、市委的具体指示下，采取了政治挂帅、全民动员、速战速决、天上地下全面围歼的战斗方针。对老鼠采用了断水断粮三天后，施用毒饵，使老鼠饿渴难当，头晕眼花，促使它见食必吃，吃而必死，同时配合用各种工具捕打和硫磺烟熏下水道三管齐下的办法。并进行翻仓库、翻粮食店、翻草堆、挖鼠洞捣鼠窝、摧毁老鼠的住宅，布置下天罗地网，使老鼠无处逃生。对麻雀，我们采用“疲劳战术”，?吓追赶，火药枪打，三面包剿铁壁合围，留出缺口，诱至预先布置好的阵地内，进行毒杀枪杀，及夜间网罩捕捉等办法，同时抄掉麻雀窝，下掉麻雀的一切“户口”不让其安家落户，使之无处栖身，有翅难飞。对蚊蝇是搞掉它们的一切孳生场所，填平坑凼，疏通沟渠，管好粪便，铲除住户周围的杂草，挖绝蝇蛹，用野生植物五朵云，断肠草，鸭脚板，打破碗花花，杀灭粪蛆，药喷烟熏捕捉成蝇成蚊，同时采取谁见谁打，见一个打掉一个，使其断子绝孙。重庆市市中区在作好一切战斗准备的基础上，提出了苦战七昼夜，不让老鼠过春节的战斗口号，全区五十多万人民人人动手，个个上阵，如期完成了歼灭老鼠的任务。经过市中区的试点后，市委决定将市中的除“四害”指挥部，改变为全市的总指挥部，同时向全市人民提出了苦战十昼夜，不让“四害”过元宵的战斗号召，群众的劲头大，说到就作到，十昼夜实现了在全市范围内基本消灭了四害的战斗任务。
    市委领导的决心大，群众的干劲足，把过去多少年来办不到的事情，在短时间内甚至几天就干完了。为了消灭蚊蝇孳生场所，群众把三十多年来积累的几个大垃圾堆消灭了。把三十多年来没有挖过的污泥沟翻新了。疏通了大小沟渠十二万条，又加六十多万丈。重庆市有个历史上遗留下来的珊瑚坝污水塘，面积有二十万平方公尺，是重庆最大的一个臭水塘，臭气四溢，人皆掩鼻而过之，群众把这个污水塘称为大粪塘，是蚊蝇孳生繁殖的大本营，许多工程技术人员，认为非短期能够解决的工程。这次群众用了三十万人次的义务劳动，二十一天的时间，挖了十万多个鹅卵石方，开凿了一条长达二千五百公尺的运河，引长江之水冲洗了这个污水塘，把死水变成了活水，把污水塘变成了清水塘。从此附近居民再也闻不到臭气了。重庆下水道出口和污水沟达三百余条，有九个较大的下水道出口，形成悬在陡壁上的大污水瀑布，岩下就是污泥臭水凼，臭气熏天，不仅是蚊蝇的孳生场所，而且严重地影响城市环境卫生。为了彻底改变这种情况，我们修建了综合四十余公里下水道，已将三百一十三条下水道出口和污水沟合并为十六条，直接把污水引入了江心。这个工程过去有些工程技术人员数次勘察，提出投资需要一千五百万元到两千万元，设计施工时间需要两年多到三年才能完成。而这次大胆跃进，实际只用了三十六万元，二十个昼夜的时间就全部完工了。市中区用了十八天的时间新建和改建了八十五个公共厕所和群众自用厕所，消灭了市区的露天粪坑，沿江边设立了四十余个活动厕所（洪水时可搬动），解决了船民大小便的问题，消灭了随地便溺的现象。并将四百多个不通下水道的厕所全部接入了下水道。目前市区内没有一个不通下水道的厕所，再也看不到影响市容和卫生的挑粪的担子和拉粪的车子了。同时整顿和净化了菜市场，清理了摊贩，并把影响市区卫生的屠宰场，饲养场，皮革厂，肠衣厂，鸡鸭加工厂等全部搬出了市中区，这就根本改变了市区的卫生面貌。
    王家坡、官井巷等许多地区把门板、木墙、屋梁等，都用刀或玻璃片刮洗得干干净净，一尘不染。郊区的乡社都作到了全部粪坑加盖，取消了私人粪坑，建立了院落公共厕所和垃圾站，作到人畜粪坑分开。马五乡等90％以上的作到了家家有痰盂，户户用公筷，人人有面巾，个个有牙刷。全市家家户户都粉刷了墙壁门面，大街小巷普遍设置了痰盂和果皮箱。一般的都建立了经常的爱国卫生制度，订立了爱国卫生公约，建立了区域责任制，门前摊前负责制，定期互相检查评比制度。在区人民代表大会上作出决议，制订了各行各业的卫生管理暂行办法。一般的都作到了“四不”“八干净”：不随地吐痰，不随地倒垃圾，不随地大小便，不乱抛瓜皮果壳和纸屑。个人身体干净，衣服干净，被褥干净，食具干净，室内室外干净，院落干净，大街小巷干净，公共场所干净。人民群众已开始养成爱干净讲卫生的良好习惯，使重庆市到处干干净净，卫生面貌焕然一新。
    以上事实说明了，群众发动起来之后，少花钱不花钱办了许多大事，改变了旧的习惯，树立了新的风气，作出了前人难以想像的事，又一次的证明了社会主义制度具有无比的优越性和生命力，证明了广大人民群众一旦觉悟提高，认识到自己是新社会的主人，就会创造出惊人的奇迹。
    在这个战斗中也出现了许多先进的事迹、先进人物，他们带动了群众鼓舞了大家除四害的决心，捕鼠能手衡永丰、李超群用铁千杀沟鼠，每人都在五千只以上。工人石云甫一人就用火枪消灭了麻雀三千余只。店员张志友厕所毒鼠的经验推广后，在市中区二百多个公共厕所中，一夜灭鼠四千六百七十余只。煤矿工人赵树云看到一只老鼠逃入江中，便奋不顾身的跳下水去把逃鼠捉回来。六十多岁的小脚老太婆，挖蛹掏沟渠不输青年。红领巾的卫生监督岗，沿街用喇叭筒喊着“叔叔娘娘（阿姨）不要走路吃香香（走路吃零嘴的意思），随地吐痰坏习惯，既不卫生又难看”通俗的啦啦词监督行人遵守公共卫生。这种动人的场面是很多的。同时经过这个战斗，广大群众的革命志气和加速社会主义建设的信心，被自己创造出来的巨大成绩所鼓舞，他们说：“上天的入地的‘四害’我们都能消灭掉，还有什么困难克服不了？还有什么事办不好？”（二）
    我们除四害所取得的成绩并不是一帆风顺的，这当中经过许多的思想斗争。在运动之初，对能否加快消灭“四害”是有不同看法的。一种态度认为：在短期消灭“四害”是可能的，有充分条件的，他们看到了经过整风社会主义教育运动，群众有着高涨的政治觉悟和积极性，全国大跃进形势的鼓舞，干部和群众有了充分的革命干劲，只要相信群众依靠群众去充分发动群众，一定能够办到，这是一种积极的革命促进派的态度。另一种态度：则与此相反，他们对群众的力量估计不足，认为办不到，持这种态度的同志是从经验主义出发，认为过去几年也搞过除“四害”斗争，也有不小的成绩，可是四害还是没有消灭掉。他们认为采用大量的普遍的施放毒饵，是一种冒险的行为，“毒不死老鼠毒死几个人我看怎样交代！”于是先进与保守、快与慢的作法，就展开了辩论，经过大辩论，批判了不相信群众的力量能做到除尽四害的保守思想。大家明确了“四害”既然是客观事物，人们就一定能够找出它们的特点和活动规律来，加以消灭。四害的特点是分布广，数量多和繁殖快（重庆的老鼠，一只母老鼠一年要生七窝到十窝，每窝七只到十二只，小鼠生下来两个月之后就能怀胎），采取小手小脚、分散作战的办法，一家一户的单干，零打碎敲分片突击的方法，就必然形成此灭彼生，击东窜西，边灭边生或生多于灭的局面。过去几年来没有能消灭了“四害”正是这个原故。关于每家每户大量施放毒饵的问题，只要依靠群众积极分子，把技术和注意事项教给群众，把群众除“四害”的热情与技术指导结合起来，采取积极分子专人负责，划片包干挨家施放，晚上在家禽上笼家畜进圈，小孩上床后，老鼠开始活动前施放，早晨在家禽家畜未出来，小孩未醒前再挨家收回老鼠未吃完的毒饵专人保管，对有危险的户（反革命、右派、地富、夫妇吵仗呕气的户）放一种特制的“安妥”毒饵，并规定放的量不超过八颗（这种药老鼠吃了必死，人吃了就会呕出来），实际证明把技术交给群众依靠群众，没有死一个人，从这个客观事实出发，采用全民动员、短促突击、速战速决、统一指挥一致行动，全面围歼，一战而获全胜的战斗方针，是非常必要的，也是完全可能的。在除四害取得全面胜利的面前，那些不相信用短时间全歼“四害”的人，不能不承认自己认识错了。还有一种态度：是把除四害看成同生产是对立的，要搞好生产就搞不好除“四害”，他特别对这样大规模的全民动员一致行动的作法，认为会影响生产妨碍生产，而事实证明这个认识也是错误的。实际上除“四害”对生产只有好处。除四害讲卫生搞好了，就减少了疾病，保证职工身体健康，精神振作，可以促进生产的大跃进。比如，重庆新华印刷厂，把除四害讲卫生搞好了后，职工和眷属的发病率比往年同期降低了40％，出勤率增加了，由于车间清洁整齐，清洗了机器，工人生产情绪高涨，精神饱满，产量和质量都有很大的提高。重庆西南制药厂，清除了逐年积累起来的一百七十多吨的大药渣堆，不仅消灭了蚊蝇孳生场所，而且经工人研究，将药渣加压，增加药液30％至40％，再把压干的药渣渗到煤里当燃料，每月可减低耗煤量0.2％，全年总计可为国家节约十万元。经技术人员进一步的研究后，又可以从药渣中提制一种新产品——草酸，饲养场搞好了清洁卫生，消灭了猪瘟，鸡鸭蛋仓库消灭了老鼠，每月减少了鸡鸭蛋损失九十斤左右。管理好垃圾制成颗肥支援了农业生产。事实证明，除“四害”讲卫生不仅不妨碍生产，而且既能保障人民身体健康，又能促进增产节约。这样各个生产企业单位的除“四害”讲卫生的工作，也就普遍巩固下来了。
              ×　×　×
    我们除四害工作，虽然作出了一些成绩，但是许多工作的成效还未经过长期的考验，例如我们根绝蚊蝇的措施，就还需要经过一个暑天的考验，要根绝“四害”还需要经过许多经常的细致的工作，所以我们必须本着除害务尽斩草除根的精神，再接再厉，清剿四害残余，不干净不罢休。同时把爱国卫生制度，坚持经常持久，养成群众的习惯。
