　　Great Principles in Small Matters
　　Shen Rong
　　I hadn't left Beijing for a long time, but recently I had the opportunity to go out for a trip. As soon as I got on the train, the most striking impression was how clean it was.
　　"Your carriages are so clean," I couldn't help but praise when the train conductor walked by.
　　"We're not the best yet. Passengers still have a lot of opinions. We very much welcome passengers to offer their opinions."
　　As the conductor answered, he showed me a suggestion book. Although everyone had just boarded the train, some people had already written their opinions. One passenger praised a service员's good attitude; another passenger suggested broadcasting more of the latest news.
　　This matter deeply moved me.
　　In the past, many people were afraid of others offering opinions. Some people clearly knew they had shortcomings but were afraid others would touch a sore spot; others had truly done their best and thought their work was impeccable. Upon hearing any opinions, they would immediately show displeasure or quickly try to explain themselves. Now it's different. People not only don't avoid treatment for fear of revealing their illness, but also sincerely welcome others to offer opinions even after they have done their best, regarding this as a basis for improving their work.
　　There will never be absolute perfection in the world. Our work could never be 100% good. Even if it's done very well today, the situation might change tomorrow, and new problems will arise. In the past, people were afraid of criticism, not only because they avoided treatment for fear of revealing their illness, but also because they didn't recognize the laws of change and development. It's gratifying that this seemingly profound philosophical principle has now been mastered and put into action by many of us.

　　小事情里的大道理
　　沈容
    很久没有离开北京，最近有机会出去了一趟。一上火车，非常突出的印象是十分整洁。
    “你们的车厢真干净。”列车长走过的时候，我忍不住称赞起来。
    “我们还不是最好的，旅客的意见还不少哩，我们非常欢迎旅客们提意见。”
    列车长一面回答，一面拿了一本意见簿给我看。虽然大家刚上车不久，但是已经有人写上意见了。一位旅客表扬了一位服务员的服务态度好；另一位旅客建议多广播一些最新的消息。
    这件事深深地感动了我。
    过去，很多人害怕别人提意见。有的明明知道自己有缺点，就怕别人碰着痛处；有的是自己已经真正尽了力，认为无懈可击了，一听到意见，就立即露出不高兴的神情，或者赶快加以解释。现在不同了。人们不仅不讳疾忌医，而且在自己已经尽了力之后，还衷心地欢迎别人提意见，把这当作改进工作的依据。
    天下永远没有绝对完美的事物，我们的工作本来就不可能做到百分之百的好。即使今天已经做得很好了，明天情况一变，又会发生新的问题。过去人们怕人批评，除了讳疾忌医之外，还由于不承认事物的变化和发展的规律。可喜的是这种好像很深奥的哲学上的道理，今天已经掌握了我们许多人的行动了。
