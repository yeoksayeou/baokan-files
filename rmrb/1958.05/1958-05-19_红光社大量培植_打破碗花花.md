　　Hongguang Cooperative Massively Cultivates "Broken Bowl Flower"
　　(Our dispatch) The Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative of Hexing Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, is now massively cultivating "Broken Bowl Flower," preparing to gradually incorporate this wild plant into planned production, so that poisonous weeds can better serve mankind.
　　The Hongguang Cooperative was the first to use "Broken Bowl Flower" on a large scale to eliminate mosquito and fly larvae. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Department's experiments have proven that it also has multiple uses in agriculture and medicine, which has aroused even greater attention from the cooperative. They conducted an investigation and found that the existing "Broken Bowl Flower" in the cooperative is far from meeting future needs. Therefore, the cooperative management committee made a special decision, requiring cooperative members to transform "Broken Bowl Flower" from wild to artificial cultivation, making use of the edges of walls and houses, ditch sides, and corners of fields for mass cultivation. The cooperative plans to reach a yield of 60,000 jin next year. In addition, attention should be paid to protecting the existing "Broken Bowl Flower," and when collecting branches and leaves, do not pull them out by the roots in order to facilitate reproduction.
　　"Broken Bowl Flower" has strong reproductive ability and does not require specific land. A few days ago, the 17th Production Team of the cooperative used a vacant lot next to a residence to transplant more than 1,000 plants, most of which survived. According to the cooperative members in charge of cultivation, "Broken Bowl Flower" blooms and bears fruit in autumn, and the flowers are very beautiful. Planting them next to houses can also beautify the environment and be enjoyed by people.

　　红光社大量培植“打破碗花花”
    本报讯　四川郫县合兴乡红光农业社现正大量培植“打破碗花花”，准备逐步把这种野生植物纳入计划生产，让毒草更好地为人类服务。
    红光社是最早大量使用“打破碗花花”消灭蚊子和苍蝇幼虫的，最近四川省农业部门试验证明，它在农业和医药上还有多种用途，更加引起该社的重视。他们进行了调查，发现社上现有的“打破碗花花”远不能适应今后需要，因此，社务管理委员会特别作出决定，要求社员们把“打破碗花花”由野生变成人工种植，利用墙边屋后，沟边地角，大量培植。该社计划明年产量达到六万斤。另外，还要注意保护现有的“打破碗花花”，采集枝叶时不要连根拔掉，以便繁殖。
    “打破碗花花”繁殖力强、不择土地，该社第十七生产队几天前利用住宅旁的一块空地，移植了一千多株，大都成活，据负责培植的社员谈，“打破碗花花”在秋天开花结果，花朵很好看，种在宅旁屋边，还可美化环境，供人欣赏。
