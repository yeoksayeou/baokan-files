The experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province, published in this newspaper on April 25, in boldly reforming enterprise management based on the rectification movement, is a significant initiative. These experiences include three aspects: First, management cadres from departments and workshops participate in half-day labor every day, and main factory-level leaders participate in one day of labor per week; second, workers, under the leadership of the workshop administration, directly participate in some of the daily management work of the production teams; and third, resolutely improve enterprise management operations, that is, reform unreasonable rules and regulations. The combination and mutual promotion of these three aspects can fundamentally improve the relationship between leading cadres and the masses of workers, further enhance the sense of responsibility and initiative of the broad masses of workers as masters, and thus promote the great leap forward in production.

After cadres participated in half-day labor and workers directly participated in the daily management of the team, profound changes first took place in the relationship between management cadres and the masses of workers. As everyone knows, in our socialist enterprises, the means of production are owned by all the people, and enterprise managers and workers are all striving for the great common goal of building socialism. They are completely equal to each other politically and have a comrade-like relationship in their work. This is fundamentally different from the exploitative and oppressive relationship between enterprise managers and workers in the old society. However, this does not mean that there are no problems at all. Some remnants of the old relations of production still exist between them. For example, there are some management personnel who do not treat workers as equals, but consider themselves to be superior, specializing in directing and managing others; they only issue orders from above, rarely go deep into the production site, and do not participate in physical labor; they believe that as long as they establish a huge organization, cumbersome rules and regulations, and adopt a purely administrative command method, they can manage the enterprise well. Therefore, they neglect the position and role of the workers as masters in the enterprise, do not rely on the creativity and consciousness of the masses to run the enterprise well, and neglect the fine tradition of our Party's mass line, thus causing a serious tendency to be divorced from the masses and reality. This is what we call bureaucracy. The workers are not satisfied with this phenomenon, and some workers even have the illusion that "management is only a matter for cadres, and workers only care about their work." This shows that there are still some remnants of the old relations of production in the enterprise, which to some extent hinder the development of the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses of workers, and are not conducive to the rapid development of productive forces. The main purpose of the Party Central Committee's instruction for cadres to participate in physical labor and to carry out the rectification movement in enterprises is to completely change the work style of cadres and raise the consciousness of the broad masses of workers as masters, so as to effectively overcome these remnants of the old relations of production, and make the relationship between leaders and the led truly a socialist relationship of equality, mutual assistance, and cooperation, so as to promote the further great development of productive forces.

The leading cadres and all the staff of the Qinghua Tool Factory showed revolutionary creative spirit in this regard. The factory not only requires leading cadres to participate in one to one and a half days of physical labor every week, but also implements a system of requiring management cadres from departments and workshops to participate in half-day labor every day; at the same time, the workers of this factory, under the leadership of the workshop administration, are assigned to directly participate in some of the daily management work of the production teams. The practical actions of cadres participating in labor, especially workers directly participating in the daily management of production teams, powerfully prove that in socialist enterprises, the difference between leaders and the led, managers and workers, is only the difference in the division of labor and responsibilities in work, and there is no difference in status. Therefore, management cadres should not only engage in management work, but also participate in certain physical labor; workers should not only engage in production, but also participate in certain management work. This has brought about new changes in people's thinking, greatly enhancing the workers' sense of responsibility as masters, making love for the factory as love for the home and cherishing state property a common practice, and further developing mutual criticism and self-criticism, so that the idea of collectivism has been greatly brought into play. The workers of the Qinghua Tool Factory made the following comparative description of the changes before and after the cadres participated in labor: "In the past, they held books in their hands, turned their heads and walked away when they saw difficulties, and the production tasks were as urgent as fire, but they sat firmly in the office building; now cadres go down, we work together, and the combination of theory and practice solves all problems." Now, in this factory, workers also affectionately call the cadres who work with them "Master Zhang" and "Master Li," just like between workers. This enables cadres and workers to help each other, understand each other, cooperate, and get along without any barriers. This new mutual relationship further promotes the great leap forward in production. Before the Qinghua Tool Factory, the Jianhua Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province, which implemented workers' participation in the daily management of production teams, "the leap forward plan was broken every day and had to be revised from time to time"; workers generally cared more about the enterprise, the products, and the collective, and took the initiative to cooperate, and did their best for the business under their charge, in an orderly manner. They put forward the slogans of "everyone is in charge of everything, everyone has something to do"; "good production, good management, both civil and military." Their enthusiasm for production, work and study has risen unprecedentedly. For management cadres, their work is more proactive, and it is possible to free themselves from the piles of affairs, concentrate their efforts on solving major problems in the enterprise, and better go deep into reality and the masses, creating favorable conditions for becoming both red and expert.

The measures taken by the Qinghua Tool Factory and the Jianhua Machinery Factory to allow workers to directly participate in some of the daily management work of the team under the leadership of the workshop administration have further enriched our experience in managing enterprises, so that our socialist enterprise management system can be more complete. Democratic centralism is the fundamental principle of our socialist enterprise management. The unified and centralized management of enterprises by enterprise leaders under the leadership of the state industrial management organs is determined by the socialist planned economy and the characteristics of modern production. However, as the Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out, a high degree of centralization must be built on a high degree of democracy. In enterprise management, while strengthening centralized leadership, it is necessary to continuously expand the democratic life of the enterprise and resolutely implement the Party's mass line. In order to realize the Party Central Committee's policy of wholeheartedly relying on the working class to run enterprises well, we have taken many effective measures in recent years, especially the implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee and the workers' representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party committee. The internal relations of the enterprise and the work in all aspects have undergone great changes, and management work has been significantly improved. However, how to enable the broad masses of workers to directly participate in the daily management work of work sections and teams, so as to make the fundamental system of democratic centralism have a broader mass base in enterprise management, is still a problem that has not been properly solved. The creations of the Qinghua and Jianhua factories have found us a new way in this regard. Combining the method of workers directly participating in the daily management of the team with the factory director responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party committee and the enterprise workers' representative assembly system, and constantly enriching and creating new experiences in the application, a relatively complete socialist enterprise management system that can implement the mass line can be gradually formed.

While implementing cadre participation in labor and worker participation in management, the Qinghua and Jianhua factories also carried out business reforms with the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations as the main content, and achieved good results. In these two factories, as in other units, there are some outdated rules and regulations and cumbersome procedures that bind the enthusiasm of the masses, seriously affecting the development of production and the improvement of management work. After cadres participated in labor and workers participated in management, the obstructive effect of these outdated rules and regulations on production became more obvious and prominent. If some unreasonable rules and regulations are not changed immediately, it will be impossible to promote the above two measures. The comrades of these two factories adopted the correct method of relying on the masses and combining leadership and the masses, boldly broke through many outdated rules and regulations, and established some new and reasonable systems, which are conducive to production and convenient for the masses to participate in management. Relying on the wisdom and creativity of the masses, the Qinghua Tool Factory abolished and simplified 263 kinds of forms and reports, revised 158 kinds of systems, and established the so-called "three deliveries to the door" system, in which relevant functional departments send materials, medicines and money to the production site, serving production and facilitating the masses, and was welcomed by the broad masses of workers. Facts have proved that to manage modern enterprises well, a set of scientific rules and regulations is indispensable. Many of the rules and regulations formulated by relevant management organs and enterprises in recent years are still applicable, but a considerable part of them have indeed become obstacles to further improving the enthusiasm of the masses and developing productive forces, and must be revised or abolished. The rules and regulations of socialist enterprises must conform to the management principles of socialist enterprises, and must be able to promote the development of productive forces and facilitate workers to carry out production activities and participate in production management. Therefore, under the line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and on the basis of the improvement of mass consciousness through the rectification movement, it is not only necessary but also entirely possible to reform rules and regulations by adopting the mass line method.

The initiative of the Qinghua Tool Factory and the Jianhua Machinery Factory in reforming enterprise management work is the result of the greatly increased communist spirit of cadres and workers under the leadership of the Party and in the rectification movement. This once again shows that the leadership of the Party, ideological work and political work are the guarantee for completing economic work. Ideology and politics are the commander, the soul. The fact is obvious that without the great political and ideological socialist revolution of the rectification movement, and without the great emancipation of the minds of the broad masses of cadres and workers, it would not be possible for this creative action based on a high degree of master consciousness to emerge. Strengthening the leadership of the Party and strengthening political and ideological work are important guarantees for reforming enterprise management, not only when carrying out reforms, but also when further implementing various new measures and new systems after the reforms.

The experiences of the Qinghua and Jianhua factories in reforming enterprise management work are a new development of our enterprise management experience and are fully in line with the management principles of socialist enterprises. These experiences have been widely promoted in industrial enterprises in Heilongjiang Province and have achieved remarkable results. All localities should study this experience and select a number of enterprises with better conditions to experiment with it, and gradually promote it after obtaining mature experience. In the process of experimentation and promotion, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and pay attention to summarizing new experiences, so as to make it more substantial and complete.

    改革企业管理工作的重大创举
    4月25日本报发表的黑龙江省庆华工具厂在整风运动的基础上，由职工群众创造出来的大胆改革企业管理工作的经验，是一项具有重大意义的创举。这些经验，包括三方面的内容。一是科室、车间管理干部每天参加半日劳动，厂级主要领导干部每周参加一天劳动；二是工人在车间行政的领导下，直接参加生产小组的一部分日常管理工 作；三是坚决改进企业管理业务，即改革不合理的规章制度。这三个方面的工作互相结合，互相推动，就可以从根本上改善领导干部和工人群众的关系，进一步提高广大职工主人翁的责任感和积极性，从而推动了生产的大跃进。
    干部参加半日劳动和工人直接参加小组日常管理工作以后，首先在管理干部和工人群众的关系上，发生了深刻的变化。大家都知道，在我们社会主义企业中，生产资料归全体人民所有，企业管理人员和工人都是为建设社会主义这样一个伟大的共同目标而奋斗。他们相互之间，在政治上是完全平等的，在工作中是同志式的关系。这与旧社会中企业管理人员对工人的剥削压迫关系根本不同。但是，这并不是说完全没有问题了，在他们中间还经常存在着某些旧的生产关系的残余，例如有这样一些管理人员，他们不是以平等姿态对待工人，而自认为是高人一等的、专门指挥和管理别人的人；他们只是高高在上发号施令，既少深入生产现场，又不参加体力劳动；他们认为，只要建立一套庞大的机构，繁琐的规章制度，采用单纯行政命令的办法，就可以把企业管好。因此，他们忽视工人群众在企业中主人翁的地位和作用，不依靠群众的创造性和自觉性来办好企业，忽视了我们党的群众路线的优良传统，因而造成了严重的脱离群众、脱离实际的倾向。这就是我们所说的官气。工人们对于这种现象是不满意的，某些工人甚至因此产生一种错觉，也认为“管理只是干部的事，工人只管干活”。这就表现了在企业中还存在有一些旧的生产关系的残余，它在某种程度上妨碍了工人群众的政治积极性和生产积极性的发扬，不利于生产力的迅速发展。党中央指示干部参加体力劳动和在企业中开展整风运动的主要目的，也就是要彻底改变干部的思想作风，提高广大职工群众的主人翁觉悟，以便有效地克服这种旧的生产关系的残余，使领导和被领导之间的关系真正成为社会主义的平等、互助、合作的相互关系，以推动生产力进一步的大发展。
    庆华工具厂的领导干部和全体职工同志在这一方面表现了革命的创造精神。这个厂不仅领导干部每周参加一天至一天半体力劳动，而且实行了科室、车间管理干部每天参加半日劳动的制度；与此同时，这个厂的工人在车间行政的领导下，分工直接参加生产小组的一部分日常管理工作。干部参加劳动特别是工人直接参加生产小组日常管理工作的实际行动，有力地证明了，在社会主义企业中，领导和被领导、管理人员和工人，只是工作中应有的分工和职责任务的不同，而没有什么高低、贵贱的差别。因此，管理干部不仅应当从事管理工作，而且应当参加一定的体力劳动；工人不仅从事生产，而且应当参加一定的管理工作。这就使人们在思想上产生了新的变化，大大地提高了工人主人翁的责任感，使爱厂如家、爱护国家财产成为风气，使相互之间批评和自我批评得到了更进一步的发展，使集体主义的思想大大发挥起来。庆华工具厂的工人，对干部参加劳动前后的变化，作了这样对比的描写：“过去本本拿在手，看见困难扭头走，生产任务急如火，他们稳坐办公楼；如今干部向下走，我们一起来动手，理论实际一结合，一切问题不发愁”。现在，在这个厂子里，工人对和他们一起劳动的干部，也像工人之间那样亲切地称呼“张师傅”、“李师傅”了。这就使干部和工人能够互相帮助，互相谅解，分工合作，相处无间。这种新的相互关系，进一步促进了生产的大跃进。在庆华工具厂之前实行工人参加生产小组日常管理工作的黑龙江省建华机械厂，“跃进计划天天被打破，时时要修改”；工人们普遍更加关怀企业，关怀产品，关心集体，主动协作，对于自己分管的业务，克尽己责，井井有条。他们提出了“事事有人管，人人有事干”；“生产好、管理好、文武双全”的口号。他们的生产、工作和学习的热情都空前高涨起来了。对于管理干部来说，他们的工作更加主动，有可能从事务堆中解放出来，集中力量解决企业中的重大问题，更好地深入实际，深入群众，为又红又专创造了有利的条件。
    庆华工具厂和建华机械厂工人在车间行政的领导下，直接参加小组一部分日常管理工作的措施，进一步丰富了我们管理企业工作的经验，使我们社会主义企业管理制度可以更加完备起来。民主集中制是我们社会主义企业管理的根本原则。企业领导者在国家工业管理机关的领导下对企业进行统一集中的管理，是社会主义的计划经济和现代化生产特点所决定的。但是，正如党中央所一再指示的，高度的集中必须建立在高度民主的基础上。在企业管理工作中，在加强集中领导的同时，必须不断扩大企业的民主生活，坚决贯彻执行党的群众路线。为了实现党中央所指示的全心全意依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针，几年来我们曾经采取了许多有效的措施，特别是实行了党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会这两个基本制度，企业内部的关系和各方面的工作有了很大的改变，管理工作显著提高。但是，怎样使广大工人群众都有可能直接参加工段和小组的日常管理工作，以便使民主集中制这个根本制度在企业管理上有更加广泛的群众基础，却仍然是一个没有得到妥善解决的问题。庆华、建华两个厂的创造，使我们在这方面找到了新的途径。把工人直接参加小组日常管理的办法，同党委集体领导下的厂长负责制和企业职工代表大会制度结合起来加以运用，并且在运用中不断充实和创造新的经验，就可以逐渐形成一套比较完整的能够贯彻执行群众路线的社会主义的企业管理制度。
    庆华和建华两个厂，在实行干部参加劳动、工人参加管理的同时，还进行了以改革不合理的规章制度为主要内容的业务改革，收到了良好的效果。在这两个厂子里，也和其他的单位一样，存在着一些束缚群众积极性的陈规陋章和繁琐的制度手续，严重地影响了生产的发展和管理工作的提高。在干部参加劳动和工人参加管理以后，这些陈规旧章对生产的障碍作用就暴露得更加明显和突出。有些不合理的规章制度如果不马上加以改变，就无法推行上述这两项措施。这两个厂的同志们采取了正确的依靠群众、领导和群众相结合的办法，大胆地突破了许多陈规陋章，建立了一些新的合理的制度，既有利于生产，又便于群众参加管理。庆华工具厂依靠群众的智慧和创造性，几天之内就废除和简化了二百六十三种表报，修改了一百五十八种制度，并且建立了由有关职能科室把材料、医药和钱款送到生产现场的所谓“三送上门”等制度，服务生产，便利群众，受到了广大工人的欢迎。事实证明，要管理好现代化的企业，没有一套科学的规章制度是不行的，几年来有关管理机关和企业所制订的各种规章制度，许多还是适用的，但是，的确有相当一部分已经成为进一步提高群众积极性和发展生产力的障碍，必须加以修改或废除。社会主义企业的规章制度，必须符合社会主义企业的管理原则，必须要能促进生产力的发展，便利工人进行生产活动和参加生产管理。因此，在多快好省地建设社会主义事业的路线下，在经过整风运动群众觉悟提高的基础上，采取群众路线的办法，改革规章制度，不仅是十分必要的，而且是完全可能的。
    庆华工具厂和建华机械厂改革企业管理工作的创举，是在党的领导下，在整风运动中，在干部和工人群众共产主义精神大大高涨的基础上所取得的成果。这就再一次表明了，党的领导，思想工作和政治工作是完成经济工作的保证。思想和政治是统帅，是灵魂。事实很明显，没有整风运动这一场伟大的政治上思想上的社会主义革命，没有广大干部和职工群众思想上的大解放，就不可能出现这种在高度主人翁思想觉悟基础上所产生的创造性的行动。加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作是改革企业管理的重要保证，不仅在进行改革的时候如此，在改革之后进一步贯彻各项新的措施和新的制度的时候更是如此。
    庆华、建华两个厂改革企业管理工作的经验，是我们企业管理经验的新的发展，是完全符合社会主义企业管理原则的。这些经验已经在黑龙江省各工业企业中普遍推广，并且收到了显著的效果。各地都应当研究这种经验，并且选择一批条件较好的企业加以试验，取得成熟的经验后逐步加以推广。在试验和推广过程中，要加强领导，及时发现和解决问题，注意总结新的经验，以便使之更加充实和完备起来。
