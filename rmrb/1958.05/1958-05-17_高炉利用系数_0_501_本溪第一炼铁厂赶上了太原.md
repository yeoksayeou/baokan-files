　　Blast Furnace Utilization Coefficient of 0.501
    Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant Catches Up with Taiyuan
    (Our Newspaper) News: On May 14th, the youth blast furnace workers of the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company created a new national record for blast furnace utilization coefficient (the number of cubic meters of effective blast furnace volume required to produce one ton of iron per day and night) of 0.501, catching up with the record of 0.523 created by the youth blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant on May 8th.
    In the "Double-Anti" movement, under the leadership of the Party, the employees of the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, after extensive airing of views, big debates, and big contentions, broke the shackles of conservative thinking and adopted the method of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and increasing coke load to strengthen the blast furnace. On March 27th, the utilization coefficient of the youth furnace first broke the highest record since 1952. Subsequently, they continuously created twelve new records. By May 14th, the utilization coefficient was reduced to 0.501. On the same day, the utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in the plant was reduced to 0.526. In early May, the average utilization coefficient of the entire plant was also reduced to 0.578. Now, the No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant will further take effective measures to strive to reduce the utilization coefficient to below 0.5.

　　高炉利用系数0.501
    本溪第一炼铁厂赶上了太原
    本报讯　5月14日，本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂青年高炉工人创造高炉利用系数（每昼夜出铁一吨所需要的高炉有效容积的立方公尺数）0.501的全国新纪录，赶上了5月8日太原钢铁厂青年高炉创造的0.523的纪录。
    在“双反”运动中，第一炼铁厂职工在党的领导下，经过大鸣大放大争大辩，打破了保守思想的束缚，采取了提高冶炼强度、提高焦炭负荷双管齐下的办法，强化高炉，3月27日青年炉利用系数首先突破了1952年以来的最高纪录，接着，又连续创造了十二次新纪录，到5月14日利用系数降低到0.501。同一天，全厂高炉利用系数都降低到0.526。5月上旬，全厂平均利用系数也降低到0.578。现在，第一炼铁厂将进一步采取有效措施，争取把利用系数降低到0.5以下。
