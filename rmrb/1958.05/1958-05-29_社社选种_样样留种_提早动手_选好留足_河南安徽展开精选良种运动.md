Select Seeds in Every Cooperative, Retain All Varieties, Start Early, Select Well and Retain Enough
Henan and Anhui Launch Fine Seed Selection Movement

    (Our report) Zhengzhou – With over 70 million mu of wheat in Henan Province poised for a bumper harvest this year, agricultural cooperatives across the region are actively engaged in a mass campaign to evaluate and select superior wheat varieties, making early preparations for an even greater harvest next year.

    In accordance with the provincial Party committee's instructions, the Xinxiang, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and Nanyang special districts are using the fields as classrooms and wheat as teaching material. They are conducting mass debates through visits, evaluations, and calculations of the experience and lessons learned from increased or decreased production of improved versus non-improved seeds. This is to criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres and the masses, who in the past did not pay attention to seed selection and retention work and feared trouble. This has unleashed a surge in fine seed selection. It is understood that currently, several tens of thousands of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have universally established specialized fine seed selection teams and trained a large number of technicians. In Dakou and Fotantou townships in Yanshi County alone, over 500 specialized teams have been organized, training more than 4,900 technicians. Some cooperatives in the Xinyang special district did not pay enough attention to seed selection and breeding work in the past. After visiting seed plots and observing the production of improved wheat varieties in other cooperatives, they decided to vigorously carry out seed selection work. In 1959, the entire special district plans to establish 1.2 million mu of wheat seed fields, accounting for 10% of the wheat planting area. Seeds for seed fields will be selected ear by ear, striving for excellence among excellence. Seeds for large fields will be selected by combining block selection and ear selection methods. Plots will be selected in advance, field markers will be made, labels will be inserted for registration, and then impurities and inferior plants will be removed. This will be done with separate harvesting, threshing, and storage to ensure no mixing and no mold. Yanshi County, which has always done a good job in wheat seed selection, retention, and cultivation, has become even more attentive and serious about seed selection work after the great debate this year. Fotantou Township in the county has decided to select 180,000 jin ear by ear, 150,000 jin grain by grain, and 500,000 jin by block. Their slogan is: "Now fine-tune the selection, next year's yield will be double the thousand (jin) per mu!" In order to select the best of the best and cultivate new varieties, many agricultural cooperatives in the county have begun to look for superior wheat ears and 100-grain wheat ears in the large fields, marking them for separate harvesting and storage in the future. These will be planted and tested in seed experimental fields to cultivate hundreds of varieties.

    Over the past few years, Party and government organizations in Henan Province have attached great importance to seed work. The province has imported from other places and selected and cultivated by the masses a total of one or two dozen excellent wheat varieties. This year, the area planted with improved wheat varieties reached more than 60 million mu, accounting for more than 85% of the province's wheat area. These improved varieties include Bima No. 1, Bima No. 4, Ximeng 6028, Baiyupi, and the peasant varieties "Liangguangtou," "Zhugangqing," and "Pingyuan 50 Wheat" suitable for planting in the Xuchang and Xinxiang areas. According to comparative experiments conducted over the years in various places, these varieties can generally increase production by about 10% under the same farming conditions. (Qu Mingzhen)

    (Our report) Hefei – Various places in Anhui Province are actively preparing for seed selection and retention during the summer harvest season, striving to use improved varieties for all autumn planting this year.

    The characteristics of this year's seed selection work are: under the slogan of "select seeds in every cooperative, retain all varieties, select well and retain enough," various places started preparations and organized arrangements early, and the masses are full of enthusiasm. For example, counties in the Fuyang special district have deployed the task of seed selection during the summer harvest through three-level cadre meetings and telephone conferences, requiring strict ear selection and plot selection in the seed fields before the summer harvest. Agricultural cooperatives that have not established seed fields should select healthy, strong-growing, full-grained, and pest-free plots through evaluation and select good seed objects. Fengyang, Chuxian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Lai'an, Quanjiao, Feidong, and other counties in the Bengbu special district have held seed selection training classes and convened meetings of agricultural technology extension stations and grain stations to exchange seed selection, retention, and preservation techniques. The Wuhu special district has identified more than 740,000 mu of seed fields for wheat and other crops, planning to select more than 140 million jin of seeds. The area of green manure seed retention fields this year also exceeds any previous year. In the Wuhu special district alone, the seed retention area for green manure crops such as red clover and alfalfa has reached more than 450,000 mu.

    Currently, many agricultural cooperatives have established seed selection committees, and production teams have established seed selection groups, delineating seed selection plots, assigning responsibility by area, and ensuring quality and quantity.

### 社社选种·样样留种·提早动手·选好留足  河南安徽展开精选良种运动

    河南安徽展开精选良种运动
    本报讯　河南省七千多万亩小麦今年大丰收已成定局。各地农业社正积极开展群众性的小麦评比精选良种活动，及早为明年小麦更大丰收作准备。
    新乡、洛阳、商丘和南阳等专区根据省委指示，以田间为课堂，小麦作教材，通过参观评比，查算良种与非良种增减产的经验教训，展开群众性的大辩论。批判了有些干部、群众过去对选留种子工作不重视和怕麻烦的右倾保守思想，从而掀起了精选良种热潮。据了解，目前全省好几万个农业社都普遍建立了精选良种专业队，训练大批技术员。仅偃师县大口、佛滩头两乡，就组织专业队五百多个，训练技术员四千九百多名。信阳专区有一部分社原来对选种育种工作注意不够，在参观了外社种子地和良种小麦生产情况后，都决定大力开展选种工作。1959年，全专区计划建立小麦种子田一百二十万亩，占小麦播种面积10％。供种子田用的种子，一律实行穗选，作到优中选优；供大田用的种子，采取块选、穗选相结合办法，事先选定地块，作出田间长足，插标登记然后去杂去劣，实行单收、单打、单存，保证不混杂，不霉烂。小麦良种选留培育工作一向做得较好的偃师县，今年经过大辩论，对选种工作更加重视、认真。该县佛滩头乡确定穗选十八万斤，粒选十五万斤，块选五十万斤。他们的口号是：“现在精挑精选，明年亩产双千（斤）”。为了优中选优，培育新品种，这个县不少农业社已开始在大田内寻找优异麦穗和百粒子的麦穗，号上标记，准备将来单收单存，在种子试验田里种植试验，培育百样品种。
    几年来，河南省党政组织一直重视种子工作。全省从外地输进和群众评选、培育出小麦优良种共有一、二十个。今年小麦良种面积达六千多万亩，占全省小麦面积的85％以上。这些良种的种类有碧蚂一号、碧蚂四号、西农六零二八、白玉皮和适应许昌、新乡地区种植的“亮光头”、“竹杆青”、“平原五零麦”等农家品种。根据各地历年的对比试验，这些品种在同样耕作条件下，一般都能增产一成上下。　（曲明振）
    本报讯　安徽省各地正在积极做好午季（即夏收）选种留种的准备工作，力争今年秋种全部采用良种。
    今年选种工作的特点是：在“社社选种，样样留种，选好留足”的口号下，各地很早就动手准备，组织安排，群众的干劲十足。如阜阳专区各县已通过三级干部会议、电话会议层层布置午季选种任务，要求午收前在种子地里严格进行穗选、片选；没有建立种子地的农业社，要通过评比，选择生长健壮、子粒饱满、无病虫害的地块和选好良种对象。蚌埠专区的凤阳、滁县、萧县、砀山、来安、全椒、肥东等县，已举办选种训练班，和召开农业技术推广站、粮站会议，交流了选种、留种、保种技术。芜湖专区确定了大、小麦等种子地七十四万多亩，计划选种一亿四千多万斤。今年绿肥留种田的面积，也超过以往任何一年，仅芜湖专区红花草、苜蓿等绿肥种子的留种地即达四十五万多亩。
    目前，很多农业社已经成立了选种委员会，生产队成立了选种小组，划定选种地块，分片负责，包质包量。
