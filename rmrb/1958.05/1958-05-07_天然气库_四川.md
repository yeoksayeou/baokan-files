　　Natural Gas Reservoir - Sichuan
　　By our reporter Li Ce and Wang Gongji

　　Sichuan is China's natural gas reservoir. The Jin Dynasty poet Zuo Si said in "Ode to the Shu Capital": "Fire wells are submerged in the secluded springs," which was a description of the natural gas wells in Qionglai County at that time. By the Tang Dynasty, the working people of Zigong were using natural gas to boil salt. From the foot of the Daba Mountains to the banks of the Chishui River, from the Qionglai Mountains to the Shizhu Basin, many natural gas seepages have been revealed on this vast land. Some places, such as Fire Well Slope, Fire Well Gully, Sacred Lamp Mountain, Sacred Lamp Temple, and Buddha Light Mountain, are named after this.
　　In the past five years, petroleum exploration teams have found one hundred and forty-three oil and gas-bearing structures in the Sichuan Basin. By the end of 1956, drilling was carried out on four structures in the Baxian Shiyougou, Qijiang Dongxi, Yongchuan Huangguashan, and Longchang Shengdengshan, and natural gas with industrial exploitation value was obtained. By 1957, a large amount of natural gas also erupted in the drilling of the Xuyong Gaomuding structure. This well, connected with the five gas fields of Zigong, Shengdengshan, Huangguashan, Shiyougou, and Dongxi, constitutes a South Sichuan gas area with an area of more than 2,000 square kilometers, which has attracted the attention of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. In February of this year, an exploratory well was drilled on the Dengjingguan structure in this gas area, and a large amount of natural gas erupted after only drilling more than 50 meters. The gas peak was as high as 40 meters, and stones as large as basketballs were washed out of the well by the strong airflow.
　　Sichuan's natural gas is stored not only in the Triassic, but also in the underlying Permian strata. When the Dongxi No. 15 well reached the Triassic oil and gas target layer, a blowout occurred. The workers originally wanted to pour mud into the well to suppress the natural gas; the mud was poured in, but the natural gas had a great impact, and it rushed out of the riverbed next to the well. According to Soviet experts, the Triassic strata are relatively shallow, and the pressure of natural gas would not be so great. There would be more natural gas in the underlying Permian. The Longchang No. 10 well drilled a large amount of natural gas in the Permian strata. This year, the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau proposed "Three Years of Hard Work to Take the South Sichuan Gas Area." This is to open the Triassic and Permian strata of each structure at the same time to find out the area and reserves of this gas area.
　　The geological conditions in Sichuan are complex. At first, the geological exploration personnel did not know that the natural gas in Sichuan was stored in the cracks of the strata, and they did not know the regularity of the cracks. In 1953, they drilled more than 20 exploratory wells in Longchang, some with very little gas, some with no gas at all, and some with a large amount of natural gas. What was the reason? They consulted Soviet experts and found natural gas with industrial value. Now, the Sichuan petroleum exploration team has developed into an exploration force with complete types of work and rich experience.
　　Sichuan has large reserves of natural gas, and its uses are also very wide. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government only used two small gas wells in Longchang Shiyougou to boil salt and drive cars. Now, the Longchang Gas Mine has continuously drilled several gas wells, the plant has been continuously expanded, and the Shengdeng brand carbon black produced is sold throughout the country and Southeast Asia. In January 1957, a branch plant was built in Qijiang. Now the whole plant produces 2,000 tons of various specifications of carbon black annually, and the quality is also continuously improving. It is China's only factory that uses natural gas to produce carbon black.
　　Now Sichuan's daily natural gas production is close to two million cubic meters, which is more than sixty times higher than before liberation. It can supply a considerable number of chemical plants as raw materials for manufacturing more than 2,000 kinds of different products such as plexiglass, artificial fibers, synthetic gasoline, and nitrogen fertilizer.
　　The natural gas in the Sichuan Basin is widely distributed. In the future, small gas mines can be established in various counties to use natural gas locally for power generation, nitrogen fertilizer production, and civil use. (Attached picture)

    天然气库——四川
    本报记者　李策　王功济
    四川是我国的天然气库。晋朝诗人左思在“蜀都赋”里说：“火井沉荧于幽泉”，就是当时描写邛崃县的天然气井。到了唐朝，自流井的劳动人民就利用天然气熬盐。从大巴山下到赤水河边，从邛崃山脉到石砫盆地，在这辽阔的土地上露出了很多天然气苗。有些地方如火井坡、火井沟、圣灯山、圣灯寺、佛光山等等，都是因此得名的。
    五年来，石油勘探队员们在四川盆地上已找到了一百四十三个储油、储气的构造。到1956年底，先后在巴县石油沟、綦江东溪、永川黄瓜山和隆昌圣灯山的四个构造上进行钻探，获得了具有工业开采价值的天然气。到1957年，在叙永高木顶构造的钻井内也喷出了大量天然气。这口井和自流井、圣灯山、黄瓜山、石油沟、东溪五个气田连接起来，构成一个面积达两千多平方公里的川南气区，引起了石油工业部的重视。今年2月，在这个气区的邓井关构造上又钻开一口探井，只钻了五十多公尺就喷出大量天然气，气峰高达四十公尺，像篮球般大的石头被强烈的气流从钻井内冲出。
    四川的天然气不但在三叠纪，就是在以下的二叠纪地层也有储藏。东溪十五号井打到三叠纪的油气目的层时发生井喷，职工们本来想往井里灌泥浆，把天然气压住；泥浆灌进去了，可是天然气的冲力很大，从这口井旁边的河床里冲出来了。据苏联专家说：三叠纪地层较浅，天然气的压力不会这么大，在下面的二叠纪还会有更多的天然气。隆昌十号井就在二叠纪地层内钻出了大量的天然气。今年四川石油勘探局提出“苦战三年拿下川南气区”。就是要把每个构造的三叠纪和二叠纪地层一齐打开，查明这个气区的面积和储量。
    四川地质情况复杂，地质勘探人员开始既不知道四川的天然气储藏在地层的裂缝里，更不晓得裂缝的规律。1953年他们在隆昌钻了二十几口探井，有的气量极小，有的根本没有气，有的却喷出大量的天然气。究竟是什么原因呢？他们请教了苏联专家，才找到了具有工业价值的天然气。现在，四川石油勘探队伍已经发展成为一支各工种齐全、经验丰富的勘探力量。
    四川的天然气储量很大，用途也非常广。解放前国民党反动政府只有隆昌石油沟两口产量很小的气井用来熬盐、开汽车。现在隆昌气矿连续钻出几口气井，厂房不断扩建，生产的圣灯牌炭黑销行全国和东南亚一带。1957年1月又在綦江建设一座分厂。现在全厂年产两千吨各种不同规格的炭黑，质量也不断提高。它是我国唯一利用天然气生产炭黑的工厂。
    现在四川的天然气日产量已接近两百万立方公尺，比解放前增加六十倍以上，能够供应相当数量的化工厂，作为制造有机玻璃、人造纤维、合成汽油、氮肥等两千种以上各种不同产品的原料。
    四川盆地的天然气分布很广，将来各县可以建立小型气矿，就地利用天然气发电、制造氮肥以及供应民用。（附图片）
