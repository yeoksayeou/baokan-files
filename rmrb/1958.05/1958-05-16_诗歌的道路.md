　　The Road of Poetry
　　Lin Ling

　　In 1927, Mr. Lu Xun, in a speech entitled "The Silent China," called on "young people to first transform China into a vocal China," saying, "Only true voices can move the people of China and the people of the world; only with true voices can we live in the world together with the people of the world."

　　Within a few years, "The Silent China" emitted songs of national salvation, awakening the Chinese people to embark on the road of resistance. The singing movement once played a significant role in the Chinese revolution. In the songs of battle, the great Chinese people achieved victory and stood up.

　　These past few days, newspapers have reported that a new singing movement is unfolding across the country along with the socialist Great Leap Forward. This singing movement differs from the past in that the people themselves have created countless enthusiastic and magnificent songs and ballads. Judging from some of the poems recently published in newspapers and magazines, written by the workers and peasants themselves, their forms and vocabulary, their spirit and rhythm, will indeed have a significant impact on the future development of Chinese poetry.

　　If it is said that for decades our poetry has never found or created a form that can best represent the spirit of our era, and our new poetry has never become the poetry of the broad masses of the people, then we can now see that the main reason is probably that we have not adopted more folk song forms, and our poets have not learned more from the people.

　　Since the May Fourth Movement, especially since the 1942 Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, our new poetry has achieved great success, but it always feels insufficient because it has not fully become poetry that is loved and readily received by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, poetry that they eagerly pass around and recite. Now, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the workers and peasants, from their own labor and feelings, have created their own poetry, providing our poets with gratifying models in both content and form.

　　On this issue, we are reminded of the situation in the Soviet poetry scene during the early days of the revolution.

　　The poems of the proletarian poet Demyan Bedny were enthusiastically welcomed by readers at the time, becoming bugles and flags on the production and military fronts. Besides the fact that his poems were closely integrated with the Party's policies, both publicizing the Party's propositions and speaking the words in the people's hearts, another important reason was that he adopted folk song and ballad forms, even forms similar to Chinese jingles, using simple and easy-to-understand words and cadences to write about the most pressing issues of the time.

　　Why did Bedny's poems achieve such high success? Because he learned from the people, used the language of the people, and adopted folk song forms. He wrote simply and clearly, making his work loved and readily received by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　From this, we get an inspiration, which is what the "People's Daily" editorial "Collect Folk Songs Nationwide on a Large Scale" said: "Only when poets go among the masses, combine with the masses, take the masses as their teachers, and learn from the poetry created by the masses themselves, can they create works that serve the masses."

　　Therefore, undoubtedly, the poems collected and organized in various places this time, whether traditional or newly created, will become rich nourishment for poets, and under the nurture of this nourishment, they will create new poems that are completely accepted by the workers, peasants, and soldiers and eagerly passed around and recited by the broad masses of the people.

　　In "Reminiscences of Lenin," Gorky said that Lenin repeatedly emphasized the propaganda significance of Demyan Bedny's works, but also said: "He is a bit rough. He is always following behind the reader; in fact, he should be running a little ahead." Lenin's instruction is also of great significance to our poets.

　　Just like a composer handles the melody of a folk song, he does not simply imitate it, but uses the melody of the folk song as material, develops it, and creates new things. Poets should learn from the people, but not simply imitate them. They must further process it and walk slightly ahead of the reader.

　　Our era is an era for poetry, and our poets must draw grain from the people's poetry treasury and then create poetry for the people, creating poetry that is loved by the people, easy to read and understand, poetry that combines the Party's policies, poetry that expresses the spirit of the times, poetry that reflects the thoughts and feelings of the people, and poetry that represents the "true voice" of the Chinese people.

### 诗歌的道路

　　诗歌的道路
  　林陵
    1927年鲁迅先生曾在一篇题名“无声的中国”的演讲里号召“青年们先可以将中国变成一个有声的中国”，他说“只有真的声音，才能感动中国的人和世界的人；必须有了真的声音，才能和世界的人同在世界上生活。”
    不几年，“无声的中国”便发出了救亡的歌声，唤起中国人民走上了抗战的道路。歌咏运动曾经在中国革命事业中起了巨大作用，在战斗的歌声中，伟大的中国人民取得了胜利，并且站立起来了。
    这几天报纸上报道，一个新的歌咏运动正随着社会主义的大跃进在全国各地展开着。这次歌咏运动和过去不同的是人民自己创作了无数热情洋溢、气势宏伟的歌谣。从最近在报刊上发表的工农群众自己编出的一部分诗歌来看，它们的形式和语汇，它们的气魄和音韵，确实对于中国诗歌今后的发展，将发生重大的影响。
    如果说，几十年来我们的诗始终没有找到、没有创造出最能代表我们这一时代精神的形式来，我们的新诗始终没有成为广大人民自己的诗，那末，现在我们可以看出，恐怕主要是没有更多采用民歌的形式，我们的诗人没有更多地向人民学习。
    自“五四”以来，特别自1942年延安文艺座谈会以来，我们的新诗获得了很大的成就，但是总感不够，因为它还没有完全成为工农群众喜闻乐见的诗，成为他们争相传诵的诗。现在工农群众在大跃进的高潮中，从自己的劳动和感受中，编出了自己的诗，从内容到形式，给我们的诗人提供了可喜的模范。
    在这个问题上，使我们想起了革命初期苏联诗坛的情况。
    无产阶级诗人杰米扬·别德内依的诗，所以受到当时读者的热烈欢迎，成为生产战线和军事战线上的号角和旗帜，除了因为他的诗紧密地结合党的政策，既宣传了党的主张，也说出了人民心里的话外，另外一个重要原因是他采用了民歌民谣的形式，甚至是类似我国顺口溜的形式，用通俗易懂的字句，铿锵可读的音韵，写出了当时最迫切的问题。
    别德内依的诗为什么会有这样高的成就呢？因为他向人民学习，使用人民的语言，采用民歌的形式，他写得简单明了，为工农群众喜闻乐见。
    从这里，我们得到一个启示，也就是“人民日报”社论“大规模地收集全国民歌”里所说的：“诗人们只有到群众中去，和群众相结合，拜群众为老师，向群众自己创造的诗歌学习，才能够创造出为群众服务的作品来。”
    因此，无疑，这次各地收集和整理的诗歌，无论是传统的或新创作的，都将成为诗人们丰富的养料，在这种养料的养育之下，创造出完全为工农群众所接受，被广大人民争相传诵的新诗。
    高尔基在“忆列宁”一书里说，列宁曾屡次着重地强调杰米扬·别德内依的作品的宣传意义，但又说：“他有点粗糙。他老是跟在读者后面走，其实他应当跑在前面一点。”列宁的这一指示，对于我们诗人也有很大意义。
    正像作曲家处理民歌的旋律一样，他不是单纯的模仿，而是利用民歌的旋律作为素材，加以发展，创作出新的东西。诗人应该向人民学习，但也不是单纯模仿，他必须更进一步地加工，稍微走在读者前面一些。
    我们的时代是出诗的时代，我们的诗人要从人民的诗库里去领取粮食，然后再为人民创作诗歌，创作人民所喜爱的、易读易懂的诗，结合党的政策的诗，表现时代精神的诗，反映人民思想和感情的诗，代表中国人民“真的声音”的诗。
