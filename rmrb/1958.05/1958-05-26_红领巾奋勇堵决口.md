    Young Pioneers Bravely Block Breach
    The heroic act of Fan Wenling, Yin Chunlai and other Young Pioneers from the Dahongqiao South Primary School in Tianjin, who bravely blocked a breach, has been praised by the school and the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative. The "Tianjin Youth Daily" also reported on their breach-blocking deeds on the 24th and published their photos.
    On the morning of May 16th, after watering the newly planted saplings, Fan Wenling and several other primary school students were walking towards the school when they suddenly noticed that a hole had been washed out of the canal bank next to the road, and water was flowing into the field. Fan Wenling ran to the hole and shouted, but there was no one in the nearby fields. Yin Chunlai then took off his woolen jacket and tried to block the hole. The woolen jacket could not stop the rapid flow of water, and the bank was breached even further, with water gushing out more fiercely, threatening to flood a large area of lush crops. They were extremely anxious and quickly jumped into the water to block the hole with their bodies. They stood in chest-deep water, shivering from the cold, with cramps in their legs, but they gritted their teeth and stood firm in the water. At that time, they had only one thought: "We must not let the water engulf the fruits of the farmers' labor." The other primary school students ran back and forth on the bank, carrying soil and looking for firewood. Chen Zhanying ran to send a message to the agricultural cooperative, falling twice and bruising his legs, but he didn't care. He quickly summoned the members of the cooperative, and together with the students, they blocked the breach. (Xinhua News Agency)

    红领巾奋勇堵决口
    天津市大红桥南小学少先队员范文玲、殷春来等奋不顾身堵决口的英勇行为，得到学校和红星农业社的表扬。“天津青年报”在24日还报道了他们堵决口的事迹，并刊载了他们的照片。
    范文玲等几个小学生在5月16日早晨给自己新栽的小树浇完水以后，向学校走去的时候，突然发现路旁水渠堤岸被水冲破了一个洞，水一个劲儿地往田里流去。范文玲奔向洞口高喊，附近田野里却没有一个人。殷春来这时就脱掉身上的绒衣，朝洞口堵去。绒衣堵不住急流的水，堤岸被决开了，水越来越猛地喷出来，眼看一大片绿油油的庄稼就要被淹没。他们几个人心里焦急万分，急忙跳下去，用身体堵住洞口。他们站在齐胸的水里冻的浑身发抖，两腿抽筋，还咬着牙立在水中。当时他们只有一个念头：“决不能让水吞没农民叔叔的劳动果实。”其余一些小学生在岸上奔跑着运土找柴草。陈占迎飞跑着去给农业社送信，跌倒两次，腿摔的青肿了也满不在乎，他很快地把社员们喊来和学生们一起把决口堵住了。　（新华社）
