Harbin 101 Construction Site Creates Miracle
　　Three Three-Story Buildings Completed in Eighteen Days

　　(Our Newspaper Harbin, May 18th) The advanced experience of the Harbin First Construction Engineering Company's 101 Construction Site in completing three three-story buildings in eighteen days has attracted the attention of construction enterprises in various regions. From May 6th to 10th, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Construction Trade Union organized cadres and engineering technicians from construction enterprises in six provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, and Beijing, to hold an on-site experience exchange meeting at the Harbin 101 Construction Site. After listening to the introduction by the person in charge of the construction site, visiting and interviewing, everyone unanimously agreed that the 101 Construction Site's completion of the entire project of three three-story buildings in an average of eighteen days is an unprecedented feat in construction history. This method was obtained by the 101 Construction Site by learning and creating, and integrating the advantages of many advanced construction experiences such as sectional parallel and three-dimensional cross operations. Many people did not believe that three three-story buildings could be built in eighteen days before visiting the construction site. Some thought that it must be using a "human wave tactic"; others thought that eighteen days might only complete the main structure, not the entire project; still others believed that it must be due to a high degree of construction mechanization.

　　Therefore, many representatives attending the meeting ran to the construction site to see as soon as they got off the train. The scene on the construction site was beyond their expectations. There were no crowded people or chaotic phenomena here; nor did they hear the roar of machines, but only saw the workers working in an orderly manner. In the upper part of the three three-story buildings under construction, some had not yet been roofed, and some were still bricklaying, but the interior walls on the first floor were freshly painted, the red magnesite floors were laid, and the light blue painted doors and windows were installed. In the past, it was necessary to wait until the three-story building was completely built before starting the internal works from the third floor from top to bottom.

　　The 101 Construction Site implemented ideological and political work of the Party into every production link of rapid construction. The phenomenon of mutual quarrels between various types of workers in the past has now been replaced by a mass spontaneous cooperative relationship. The engineers all said: "Participating in this meeting is not only attending a technical class, but also a vivid political class." Everyone believes that there is still much potential to be tapped in completing the entire project of three three-story buildings in eighteen days, and they are full of confidence in promoting this rapid construction experience.

　　哈尔滨一○一工地创造奇迹
    十八天建成三栋三层楼房
    本报哈尔滨18日电　哈尔滨第一建筑工程公司一○一工地用十八天时间建成三栋三层楼房的先进经验，已经引起各地建筑企业的重视。5月6日到10日，建筑工程部和全国建筑工会组织了河北、山东、山西、辽宁、吉林、北京等六个省、市的建筑企业的干部和工程技术人员，在哈尔滨一○一工地举行了现场交流经验会议。经过听取这个工地负责人的介绍、参观和访问，大家一致认为一○一工地平均以十八天时间完成三栋三层楼房的全部工程，这是建筑史上空前的创举。这个方法是一○一工地以学习与创造的精神，综合了分段平行、立体交差作业等许多施工先进经验的优点获得的。许多人在没有到工地参观以前，总不相信十八天能盖好三栋三层楼房。有人想，一定是采用“人海战术”；也有人想十八天可能是仅完成主体工程，不会全部完工；还有人认为一定是施工机械化程度高。
    因此，许多参加会议的代表一下火车就跑到工地去看。工地上的景象却出乎他们的意料之外，这里看不到拥挤的人群和混乱的现象；也听不到机器的轰鸣，只看到工人们有秩序地在进行工作。正在建筑的三栋三层大楼的上部，有的还没有上屋架，有的还在砌砖，可是在一层楼里的室内墙壁已粉刷一新，红色的菱苦土地面打好了，油漆成淡蓝色的门窗都已安装完毕。而过去都是要等把三层楼全建成再从三层楼由上而下开始进行内部工程。
    一○一工地党的政治思想工作贯彻到快速施工的每一个生产环节中。过去各工种之间互相争吵的现象，现在由群众性的主动协作关系代替了。工程师们都说：“参加这次会议，不仅是上了一堂技术课，而且是一堂生动的政治课”。大家认为十八天时间完成三栋三层楼房的全部工程中还有许多潜力可挖，并满怀信心地推广好这个快速施工经验。
