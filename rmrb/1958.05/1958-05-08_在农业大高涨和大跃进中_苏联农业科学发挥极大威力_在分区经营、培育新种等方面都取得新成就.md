Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 7th: The Chairman of the Presidium of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, P. Lobanov, recently spoke to reporters from this news agency and other foreign journalists about the achievements and tasks of Soviet agricultural science during the great upsurge and Great Leap Forward in Soviet agriculture.

Lobanov pointed out that agricultural science bears a significant responsibility in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. In every stage of agricultural development, the achievements of agricultural science and advanced experiences have always been reliable pillars. Currently, the Soviet Union has 800 agricultural experimental stations, employing 11,000 scientific staff; there are 100 higher agricultural schools with 14,000 professors and teachers who are also engaged in scientific research.

Lobanov said that the task of Soviet agricultural science is to rapidly apply the achievements of modern science to agricultural production, to expand the scope of agricultural scientific research, and to raise the level of research. At present, the central task of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences and various agricultural scientific research institutes is primarily to formulate a system of regional agricultural management. Regional management methods include measures such as determining which crops are suitable for planting in a particular region and what agricultural techniques should be implemented in a particular region. The purpose of regional management is to increase yields in various regions with different conditions, using different methods.

Breeding new varieties of crops is another important source of increasing yields and is also a problem that Soviet scholars are focusing their efforts on. In the past two years alone, more than 200 new varieties have been recommended for planting in various regions. A type of durum wheat bred by the Academy of Agricultural Sciences yields 20% to 25% more than ordinary wheat, and its protein content is 4% higher than ordinary wheat. Soviet scholars have already bred sunflower varieties with a fat content of 54%.

In terms of fertilizers, the main focus is on the widespread use of granular fertilizers among phosphate fertilizers, followed by the manufacture of bacterial compounds that can transform phosphorus in the soil that plants cannot originally absorb into phosphorus that they can absorb. This can greatly improve soil fertility.

In terms of disease and pest control, the Soviet Union is considering establishing an organization similar to a fire brigade, so that as soon as an alarm is raised, they can immediately go to the site of the disease or pest outbreak and immediately put it out.

In terms of agricultural machinery, many research institutes are working hard to manufacture suspended universal machines. If all agricultural machines adopt suspended universal tractors in the next few years, it will be possible to reduce approximately one million connecting hands and save 500,000 tons of steel per year.

Lobanov pointed out that the use of radioactive isotopes is already very widespread in agriculture and agricultural science. Currently, there are more than 100 agencies in the Soviet Union studying the application of isotopes in agriculture. Research institutes have used "tracer" atoms to determine that granular fertilizers are best in size from one millimeter to two millimeters, like grains. This year, antibiotics are also widely used in animal husbandry. Adding 20 grams of antibiotics to each ton of feed can make livestock gain weight faster.

    在农业大高涨和大跃进中
    苏联农业科学发挥极大威力
    在分区经营、培育新种等方面都取得新成就
    新华社莫斯科7日电　全苏列宁农业科学院主席团主席帕·洛巴诺夫最近对本社记者和其他一些外国记者谈到了在苏联农业大高涨和大跃进中，苏联农业科学的成就和任务。
    洛巴诺夫指出，在发展农业和畜牧业中，农业科学负有重大的责任。在发展农业的各个阶段，农业科学的成就和先进经验一向是可靠的支柱。现在，苏联有八百个农业试验站，在这些站里工作的科学工作人员达一万一千人；有高等农业学校一百所，其中教授和教师有一万四千人，他们也在进行科学研究工作。
    洛巴诺夫说，苏联农业科学的任务是把现代科学上已经达到的成就迅速运用到农业生产中去；扩大农业科学研究的范围，提高研究水平。现在，列宁农业科学院和各农业科学研究所的中心工作首先是制订出农业分区经营的体系。按地区经营方式中包括这样一些措施，某一地区适宜于种那种农作物，某一地区应该实行怎样的农业技术。分区经营的目的在于在各种条件不同地区，用不同方法提高产量。
    培育农作物新品种是提高产量的另一重要来源，也是苏联学者们集中力量研究的一个问题。在最近两年来，已有两百多种新品种推荐给各地栽种。农业科学院培育的一种硬粒小麦，收成比一般小麦高20％到25％，蛋白质含量比一般小麦高4％。苏联学者们已经培育出含脂量达54％的向日葵品种。
    在肥料方面，主要是研究在磷肥中广泛采用颗粒状肥料，其次是制造带菌的化合物，这种化合物能够使土壤中植物原来不能吸收的磷变成能够吸收的磷。这样就能大大提高土壤的肥沃程度。
    在防治病虫害方面，苏联正在考虑成立像救火队一样的组织，以便一有警报，就立刻到发生病虫害的地方去，立即加以扑灭。
    在农业机械方面，许多研究所正在为制造悬挂式的万能机器而努力。如果在最近几年内，农业机器全部采用悬挂式的万能拖拉机，那么就能够减少约一百万联接手，每年可以节约五十万吨钢铁。
    洛巴诺夫指出，在农业和农业科学方面，利用放射性同位素已经非常广泛。现在，苏联已经有一百多个机关在研究同位素在农业中的应用。研究机关用“示踪”原子研究出了粒状肥料最好是像谷粒一样，大小从一公厘到二公厘最好。今年，在畜牧业方面还广泛应用抗生素。每一吨饲料中放二十公分的抗生素就可以使牲畜重量增长得更快。
