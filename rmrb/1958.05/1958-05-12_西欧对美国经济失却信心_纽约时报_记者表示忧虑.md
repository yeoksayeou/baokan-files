Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th (TASS) -- "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger said in an article: "The American economic recession has created problems for the West," and "At this unfavorable moment, the recession has already caused a reaction abroad."

Sulzberger said, "America's friends are expressing concern about America's current economic plans... while the Soviet Union continues to develop production vigorously. A mood of lost confidence is spreading across the Atlantic. Steel production in Britain and West Germany is decreasing. Industrial plans have become unreliable." As for France, it is also "once again approaching an economic mire."

Sulzberger said, "A large part of the Western economy has fallen into depression... The Organization for European Economic Cooperation, established according to the Marshall Plan, is experiencing one of its most serious crises on its tenth anniversary."

Sulzberger also expressed concern about the fact that as underdeveloped countries increasingly hope to establish commercial ties with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the United States and other Western countries are in danger of losing ground here.

　　西欧对美国经济失却信心
    “纽约时报”记者表示忧虑
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格在一篇文章里说：“美国的经济衰退给西方造成了问题”，“在这个不利的时刻，衰退已经在国外引起了反应”。
    苏兹贝格说，“美国的朋友对美国目前在经济方面的打算正表示忧虑……而苏联却继续有力地发展生产。失掉信心的情绪正扩大到大西洋的对岸。英国和西德的钢产量正在减少。工业计划变成了不可靠的东西”。至于法国，它也“再一次临近经济的泥坑”。
    苏兹贝格说，“西方很大一部分经济已经陷入了萧条……按照马歇尔计划建立起来的欧洲经济合作组织在它的十周年时正在经历着一次最严重的危机”。
    苏兹贝格同时还对这一点表示忧虑：由于不发达国家日益希望同苏联和其他社会主义国家建立商业联系，美国和其他西方国家就有在这里失掉阵地的危险。
