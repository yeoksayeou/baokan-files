Water Lifting Tools Bloom Everywhere
    ——Introduction to the Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Hall of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition (Part Two)
    By our reporter Zhu Cheng
    In the canal of the Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Hall, people can see more than 130 water lifting tools created and improved by the masses. These tools include pipe-chain types, dragon-bone types, and pump types, as well as spiral types and bucket types; there are human-powered hand-cranked and foot-pedaled waterwheels, as well as animal-powered, water-powered, and wind-powered waterwheels. A common feature of these water lifting tools is that most of them have larger water output and higher irrigation efficiency than the original pipe-chain waterwheels, windlasses, and dragon-bone waterwheels.
    Looking at these waterwheels, people deeply feel how good the broad masses of farmers are at using local materials and how good they are at utilizing old items and materials. For example, the wooden hand-cranked waterwheel made by farmers in Jingxian County, Hebei Province, the hand-cranked water pump created by farmers in Boxian County, Anhui Province, and the hand-cranked wooden centipede waterwheel created by farmers in Xianxian County, Hebei Province, are basically or entirely made of wood. Many even have pipes and chains made of wood or bamboo. The frames and parts from old looms, cotton gins, cotton rollers, bicycles, chaff cutters, and cart wheels have also been utilized by farmers, equipped with the pipes and chains from Liberation-style waterwheels and small five-wheel waterwheels, and made into various styles of waterwheels. Zhang Shutai, the production team leader of the Tanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Fucheng County, Hebei Province, removed the leather roller from a cotton gin and used it to drive the pipe chain of an old small five-wheel waterwheel that he had modified into a foot-pedaled waterwheel, costing only nineteen yuan; when drawing water from a well with an eight-foot head, it can discharge thirty tons of water per hour. When not pumping water, the cotton gin can be reattached with the leather roller to gin cotton, so it is very popular among farmers, and seventeen units were quickly promoted throughout the township.
    Here you will also find that many water lifting tools have novel parts that old-fashioned water lifting tools did not have: some have two or one huge iron wheel, wooden wheel, or stone mill installed on both ends or in the middle of the axle; some have two large iron cart wheels installed; some have a very long wooden pole placed horizontally on the waterwheel, with two stone rollers tied to the ends of the wooden pole; some hand-cranked waterwheels have two thick and long pieces of wood installed on both ends of the axle, and the crank is installed on one end of the large wood... These novel parts are installed by farmers based on practical experience, and they are very labor-saving and highly efficient to operate.
    Using the above principles, farmers not only made some new waterwheels themselves, but also modified new-style waterwheels. Waterwheels that used to be turned by people pushing them can now be turned by people using only their hands without moving their legs; what used to require standing and walking to operate can now be done sitting down. The Liberation-style waterwheel improved by members of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Huanglong Township, Kaifeng County, Henan Province, is such a water lifting tool. In the past, two people pushed the waterwheel around the well, walking seven miles in an hour, and even the strongest person would be exhausted after working for a day. Now it has been changed to a wooden-pole rotating waterwheel, and people don't have to walk anymore, just push it with both hands, and the irrigation efficiency is four or five times higher than before. Zhang Dehe of the Construction Engineering Team in Yugan County, Jiangxi Province, created a double-wheel foot-pedaled dragon-bone waterwheel, where people sit on it and pedal the pedals to draw water, and one person can irrigate thirty mu of land in a day; when the axle rotates, an electric fan-shaped fan is driven to rotate, and the cool breeze blows directly at the water drawer. The people of Jingxian County, Hebei Province, used bicycle parts to make a foot-pedaled flywheel waterwheel. When people draw water, they can pedal like riding a bicycle to draw water. This waterwheel discharges 30 tons of water per hour, and the water drawer can lie on the front crossbar to read books and newspapers.
    A cylinder waterwheel like a children's seesaw aroused great interest among the audience. Two children ride on both ends of the board up and down, and the cylinder under the board will pump water. Although its water output is not large, it can utilize semi-labor. How lively the farmers' ideas for reforming tools are! Many viewers were eager to ride on it and pump water with squeaks.
    In the south, farmers use dragon-bone waterwheels to draw water, which is hard work and not very efficient. Now it's better. Here, people can see the various types of dragon-bone waterwheels reformed by farmers in various southern provinces. The enclosed type has increased the water output, and the flywheel type can be sat down and pedaled lightly like a cotton gin. And there are also hand-cranked, windmill-driven, and so on.
    Here you can see that farmers are trying their best to solve the problem of water lifting tools themselves, and trying their best to reduce the labor of drawing water. Many of the water lifting tools reformed and created by farmers are semi-mechanical. Not only that, but they have also started to make machines or imitate machines themselves. The wooden bicycle-style waterwheel in Hefei, Anhui, is an example. In addition, there is a wooden vertical water pump (pump) next to the pool. This water pump was made by the members of the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative in Wangwenzhuang, Jinghai County, Hebei Province, imitating the product of the Yangliuqing Xinsheng Iron Factory—axial flow pump. All of its parts are made of wood. When pumping water, using the same horsepower, except for the lower head, the water output is roughly the same as the axial flow pump. It only costs thirty to forty yuan to make such a simple water pump, which is only one-tenth of the price of an axial flow pump.
    Urban workers are also trying their best to manufacture drainage and irrigation machinery for farmers to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. Around the large pool are also displayed many gas engines, portable steam engines, diesel engines, and various water pumps, hydraulic pumps, artificial rain-making devices, etc. Among them, the water ram pump made in Changsha can ram water to a height of several hundred meters, which is a powerful tool for developing irrigation in mountainous areas. These machines are all performing around the pool. The gas engine is an important drainage and irrigation machine that has only recently been promoted and used in rural areas. Farmers have not only creatively used it, but also transformed it. That is the adobe gas generator created by Yang Shuen and others, members of the Shuigaozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Jinghai County, Hebei Province. This gas generator not only saves steel, but also can be made by farmers themselves, and the cost is very low.
    After the irrigation area is expanded, improving irrigation technology and advocating ridge irrigation, ditch irrigation, and small water shallow irrigation are major issues. The underground tile pipe irrigation ditch created by the Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, is praised by visitors as a "remarkable" creation. Wang Yuzhen, the Party branch secretary of the Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative, one of the creators, explained the creation process and its benefits in detail to people in front of the model. It not only saves the cultivated land for digging many canals, but also is simple to build, makes the cultivated land easy to cultivate, and saves water and can prevent flooding.
    Here people have seen the climax of the development of farmland irrigation in our country, seen the creation of the broad masses, and also seen that irrigation technology is constantly being innovated.

    提水工具遍地开花
    ——全国农具展览会农田灌溉排水机具馆介绍之二
    本报记者　朱成
    在农田灌溉排水机具馆的水渠上，人们可以看到一百三十多部群众创造和改良的提水工具，这些工具有管链式的、龙骨式的和唧筒式的，也有螺旋式和斗子式的；有人力手摇、脚踏水车，也有畜力、水力、风力水车。这些提水工具一个共同的特点是：多数都比原有的管链式水车、辘轳和龙骨水车出水量大，浇地效率高。
    看了这些水车，人们深深感到：广大农民群众多么善于就地取材，多么善于利用旧物旧料。像河北省景县农民制造的木制手摇水车、安徽省亳县农民创造的手摇抽水机、河北省献县农民创造的手摇木蜈蚣水车等等，基本上或完全使用木料制造的，很多连管子和链子都是木料或竹料制成的。破旧的织布机、弹花机、轧花机和自行车、铡草机、大车轮等工具上的架子和部件也被农民们利用起来，配上解放式水车和小五轮水车的管子和链子便制成了各种样式的水车。河北阜城县潭庄农业社生产队长张书太，卸去弹花机的皮辊，用它来带动旧小五轮水车上的管链改装成的脚踏水车，只花了十九元钱；车水时在扬程八尺的水井中每小时可以出水三十吨。不抽水时弹花机还可以安上皮辊弹棉花，因此农民十分欢迎，全乡很快的推广了十七台。
    在这里你还会发现很多提水工具都有旧式提水工具所没有的新奇部件：有些在轮轴的两端或当中安上两个或一个巨大的铁轮、木轮或石磨；有的安上两个大车铁轮；有的在水车上横放一根很长的木杆，木杆的两头拴着两个石砘；有的手摇水车轮轴的两头安着两段又粗又长的大木头，摇把再安到大木头的一端上……这些新奇的部件，是农民们根据实际体验安装的，操作起来非常省力，效率很高。
    农民利用上述道理不仅自己造了些新的水车，而且还改装了新式水车。过去要由人推着转的水车，现在人不动腿只用手就可以使它转动起来了；过去需要站着、走着操纵，现在可以坐下。河南省开封县黄龙乡前进农业社社员们改良的解放式水车，就是这样一种提水工具。过去，两个人推着水车围着水井转，一小时要走七里路，再强壮的人，干上一天，也疲劳不堪。现在改成了木杆旋转水车，人不要走了，只要用两手推动，浇地效率还比原先提高了四、五倍。江西省余干县建筑工程队张德和创造的双轮脚踏龙骨水车，人坐在上面用脚踏动踏板车水，一个人一天可以灌田三十亩；当轮轴转起来的时候，一架电扇形的风扇便被带动旋转起来，凉风正好对着车水人习习吹来。河北省景县的人们利用自行车的部件制造的脚踏飞轮水车，人车水的时候，像骑在自行车上一样，两脚踏动就可车出水来，这种水车，每小时出水三十吨，车水人可以伏在前面的横杆上看书看报。
    一部像儿童玩具翘翘板式的吸筒水车引起了观众的很大兴趣，两个儿童骑在板的两头一上一下，板下的吸筒就出水了。它的出水量虽然不大，却可以利用半劳力。农民改造工具的思想多么活泼啊！不少观众看到这个东西都要兴致勃勃地骑上去吱吱呀呀地车起水来。
    南方的农民用龙骨水车车水，劳动是够重的，效率也不高。现在好了。在这里，人们看南方各省农民改造的各式各样龙骨水车。封闭式的提高了出水量，飞轮式的可以坐下来像踏弹花机一样地轻快地踏了。而且还有手摇的、风车带动的等等。
    在这里可以看到，农民在千方百计地自己解决提水工具，千方百计地减轻车水的劳动。农民改造和创造的提水工具很多都是半机械的。不仅如此，他们还开始自己造机器或者仿造机器了。安徽合肥的木制自行车式水车就是一个例子。另外在水池旁边还有一台木制的立式水泵（抽水机）。这台水泵是河北静海县王稳庄富民农业社的社员们仿照杨柳青新生铁工厂的产品——轴流式水泵制造的，它的全身的部件都用木料制成，在抽水的时候，使用相同的马力，除扬程较低外，出水量和轴流式水泵大体相同。制造这样一台简易水泵只要三、四十元钱，只等于轴流式水泵价格的十分之一。
    城市工人也在千方百计地为农民制造排灌机械，支援农业生产大跃进。大水池的周围还陈列了很多煤气机、锅驼机、柴油机和各种水泵、水轮泵、人工降雨器等。其中长沙所造的水击扬水器可以把水击到几百公尺的高程，是山区发展灌溉的利器。这些机械都在水池周围表演着。煤气机是不久前才在农村中推广使用的一个重要排灌机器，农民不仅创造性地使用了它，而且改造了它。那就是河北省静海县水高庄农业社员杨树恩等人创造的土坯煤气发生炉。这种煤气发生炉，既节约钢材，而且农民自己就可以做，成本很低。
    灌溉面积扩大后，改进灌溉技术，提倡畦灌沟灌，小水浅灌是很大的问题。河南偃师县东寺庄农业社创造的地下瓦管灌溉渠，参观的人都说是“了不起”的一种创造。创造人之一东寺庄农业社的中共支部书记王玉振，在模型面前给人们详细地讲解着创造经过和它的好处。它不仅可以节约开挖很多水渠的耕地，而且修建简易，使耕地便于耕作，并且省水和能够防止大水漫灌。
    在这里人们看到了我国农田灌溉事业发展的高潮，看到了广大群众的创造，而且看到了灌溉技术正在不断地革新。
