　　Soviet Planes Bomb Ice Dam
　　Group of Residents in Inner Mongolia Escape Danger
Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, 18th: More than 800 people of various ethnic groups in Qiqian Township, Ergun Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, who had been trapped by floods for many days, have escaped danger with the help of Soviet aircraft. The residents are rebuilding their homes and resuming production with the help and guidance of the government.
In early May, the Ergun River, near the Soviet border in our country, thawed and opened, and huge ice blocks blocked the river channel, causing the river water to surge into a disaster. Wuqiluo, Jilalin, Nanlugou, Damusu and other villages in Qiqian Township along the river were flooded, and more than 800 residents were trapped in floodwaters as deep as two or three meters, creating an extremely urgent situation. After receiving the news, the Soviet Khabarovsk Military District sent planes on the 4th to bomb the ice dams piled up on the Ergun River. After three or four days of bombing, the hard ice blocks were blasted open, and the floodwaters receded.
In 1956 and 1957, the Soviet Union also took the initiative to send aircraft to bomb the ice dams on the Ergun River, enabling residents along the river to avoid floods.

　　苏联派飞机炸开冰坝
　　内蒙古一批居民脱险
    新华社海拉尔18日电　被洪水围困多日的内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟额尔古纳旗奇乾乡八百多各族居民，经过苏联飞机援救，已经脱险。居民们正在政府的帮助和指导下重建家园和恢复生产。
    5月初，我国靠近苏联边境的额尔古纳河解冻开河，巨大的冰块堵塞了河道，致河水暴涨成灾。沿河奇乾乡的乌启罗夫、吉拉林、南芦沟、达木苏等屯被洪水淹没，八百多居民被围困在深达二、三公尺的洪水中，情况万分紧急。苏联哈巴罗夫斯科军区得到这个消息后，便在4日派飞机轰炸额尔古纳河上堆积成山的冰坝，经过三、四天的轰炸，将坚硬的冰块炸开，洪水才退落下去。
    在1956和1957年的这个时候，苏联也曾主动地派来飞机轰炸额尔古纳河的冰坝，使沿河居民免遭水患。
