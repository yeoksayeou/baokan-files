    Introduction to Five Types of Rural Power Machinery
    Gas Engine: This is the most suitable power machine for rural areas right now. Its advantage is that it uses solid fuel; firewood, charcoal, and anthracite can all be burned. These fuels are plentiful and cheap, and it consumes less fuel than the portable steam engine, while its thermal efficiency is higher. The steel required to manufacture a gas engine is also less than that needed for a portable steam engine. The picture shows a "16-horsepower gas engine."
    Diesel Engine and Gasoline Engine: Both diesel engines and gasoline engines have the advantages of being lightweight and highly efficient. Compared to diesel engines, gasoline engines are lighter, but they require high-grade fuel, which costs twice as much as diesel. The fuel consumption per horsepower-hour is also higher than that of a diesel engine. The picture shows a "12-16 horsepower diesel engine" and a "Type 26 gasoline engine."
    Portable Steam Engine: That is, the steam engine. Because its steam engine is generally placed on top of the boiler, it is called a portable steam engine. The advantage of the portable steam engine is that fuel can be obtained locally, and anything can be burned. However, the disadvantages are that fuel consumption is relatively high, the volume is bulky, and more steel is required. The picture shows a "38-horsepower portable steam engine."
    Electric Motor: This is the best kind of power machine. It is economical and convenient. An electric motor is much cheaper than other power machines of the same power. Secondly, it is easy to operate, convenient to use, and highly efficient. It can be used wherever there is a power source. The picture shows an "induction motor."

    五种农村动力机械介绍
    煤气机：是现在最适合农村的动力机。它的好处是用固体燃料，木柴、木炭、白煤都可以烧。这些燃料既多又便宜，而且它消耗的燃料也比锅驼机省，热效率却高，制造煤气机用的钢材也比锅驼机少。图为“16马力煤气机”
    柴油机和汽油机：柴油机和汽油机都具有设备轻便、效率高的优点，汽油机同柴油机比，重量更轻，但要用高级燃料，成本比柴油贵一倍，每马力小时的耗油量也比柴油机多。图为“12—16马力柴油机和“26型汽油机”
    锅驼机：即蒸汽机，因为它的蒸汽机一般是放在锅炉上面，因而就叫做锅驼机。锅驼机的优点是燃料可以就地取材，烧什么都可以，但缺点是燃料的消耗量比较大，体积也笨重，要使用较多钢材。图为“38马力锅驼机”
    电动机：是最好的一种动力机，经济、方便，一台电动机跟一台同等功率的其他动力机比，价钱要便宜得多。其次是操作容易，使用方便，效率也高，只要有电源的地方就可以使用。图为“感应电动机”
