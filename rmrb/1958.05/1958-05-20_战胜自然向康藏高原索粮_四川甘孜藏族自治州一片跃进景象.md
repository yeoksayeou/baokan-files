　　Conquering Nature and Demanding Grain from the Tibetan Plateau
　　A Scene of Great Leap Forward in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan
    (Reported by this newspaper) This year's spring plowing production in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, presents a scene of a Great Leap Forward. Local Tibetan farmers have broken with conventions and launched a mass movement to accumulate fertilizer, build small-scale water conservancy projects, and promote advanced technologies, determined to conquer nature, demand grain from the Tibetan Plateau, and strive for a bumper harvest this year.
    This year, the Autonomous Prefecture has set an agricultural leap forward plan to increase grain production by 20% in most counties, increase irrigation area by 100,000 mu, and double the area of fertilization. In Kangding, Danba, and other places, four agricultural cooperatives are striving to achieve a yield of 1,000 catties per mu this year, creating a new record for grain production on the plateau.
    The farmers in the eastern and northern parts of the Autonomous Prefecture, who have completed the democratic reform and are moving towards cooperativization, have great enthusiasm for production. Many townships and cooperatives have spontaneously changed the old habits of "men not carrying manure and women not plowing the land," and new scenes of young men picking up manure on the mountains and women plowing the fields have emerged. At present, canals and embankments are being built everywhere. In the Mashu District of Garzê County, 29 canals were built in six days, with a total length of more than 50 kilometers, which can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land.
    During this year's spring plowing, new agricultural tools and advanced technologies have gradually attracted the attention of local farmers. Many agricultural cooperatives along the Kangzang Highway have sent special personnel to agricultural technology stations to learn production technologies. Some places have held short-term agricultural technology training classes. Some cooperatives have adopted new technologies such as mixed corn planting and seed dressing with pesticides in spring plowing, and have begun to use new walking plows and six-row seeders and other agricultural tools.
    By the beginning of spring plowing, 80% of the agricultural population in the Autonomous Prefecture had completed the democratic reform. More than 20% of the farmers in these areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Because the production on the plateau was backward in the past, there is great potential for increasing production. The first batch of agricultural cooperatives established in the Autonomous Prefecture last year generally increased production by 30%, and some even doubled or tripled, thus encouraging the enthusiasm of farmers in the Autonomous Prefecture to increase grain production. In the Daofu County on the Kangzang Highway, more than half of the farmers joined the cooperatives in this spring's establishment of cooperatives, and they have a high enthusiasm for increasing production. This county will increase grain production by 35% this year compared with last year.
    In order to help the farmers in the Autonomous Region to make a leap forward in agriculture, during the spring plowing, the state has issued loans to poor farmers for seeds, food, cattle, and agricultural tools.

### 战胜自然向康藏高原索粮  四川甘孜藏族自治州一片跃进景象

　　战胜自然向康藏高原索粮
　　四川甘孜藏族自治州一片跃进景象
    本报讯　四川省甘孜藏族自治州今年春耕生产中呈现一片跃进景象。各地藏族农民打破常规，掀起了群众性的积肥和兴修小型水利和推行先进技术的热潮，决心战胜自然，向康藏高原索取粮食，力争今年农业大丰收。
    今年，自治州订出了要在大部分县增产粮食20％，增加灌溉面积十万亩，施肥面积扩大一倍的农业跃进计划。康定、丹巴等地有四个农业社今年要争取达到亩产千斤，创造高原上粮食丰产的新纪录。
    已经完成民主改革、正向合作化迈进的自治州东部和北部的农民，生产劲头很大，不少乡、社自动改变了“男不背粪、女不犁地”的旧习惯，出现了小伙子拣粪上山，妇女们下地扶犁的新气象。目前，到处都在修渠筑堰，甘孜县麻书区六天内就修好了二十九条水渠，共长五十多公里，能灌溉一万多亩土地。
    今年春耕中，新式农具和先进技术已逐渐引起当地农民重视，康藏公路沿线许多农业社，都派专人到农业技术站学习生产技术，有的地方举办了短期农业技术训练班，部分社在春耕中采用了玉米混合点播、药剂拌种等新技术，并开始使用新式步犁和六行播种机等农具。
    到春耕开始前，自治州已有80％的农业人口地区完成了民主改革。这些地区20％以上的农民加入了农业生产合作社。由于高原上过去生产落后，增产潜力大，自治州去年建立的第一批农业社当年一般都增产30％，有的甚至增产一倍到两倍，因而鼓舞了自治州农民增产粮食的热情。康藏公路上的道孚县今春建社中，有半数以上的农户入了社，增产劲头很高，这个县今年粮食比去年增产35％。
    为了帮助自治区农民在农业上跃进，春耕中，国家给贫苦农民发放了种籽、口粮、耕牛、农具等贷款。
