    What Qualifies a Person as a Laboring Peasant?
    Comrade Yu Zhiming mentioned in his letter: "I'm good at my work, whether it's good or bad, I have a set of skills. As long as I obtain the qualifications of a laboring peasant after a year and a half, I will meet the requirements of the Party for a cadre who is both red and expert." From this sentence, we can see that his understanding of this issue is not only one-sided but also fundamentally flawed. Obtaining the qualifications of a laboring peasant is not as simple and concrete as a student obtaining a graduation diploma after studying at school. Its meaning is very complex and far-reaching. Therefore, even after you have been working for a period of time, the peasants will never issue you any certificates proving that you have the qualifications of a laboring peasant. For example, if a cadre sent to work in the countryside is indifferent to the big and small things that the surrounding masses are concerned about, and does not care about the future happiness of 600 million people, and only revolves around his own little world, then even if you bury yourself in the fields 365 days a year, enduring the sun, rain, or snow, your thoughts and feelings will still be incompatible with those of the laboring people. Therefore, even if you have been working for a long time, it cannot be said that you have obtained the qualifications of a laboring peasant.
    For example, when the bourgeois rightists rampantly attacked the Party and the people last May, why were the workers and peasants able to resolutely defend the interests of the Party, while many intellectuals resonated with the rightist remarks? This shows that the thoughts and feelings of the workers and peasants are fundamentally different from those of the intellectuals. If you are just a peasant during the day and still a bourgeois-style intellectual at night, unwilling to connect with the masses, and unwilling to do social work, still "being in Cao Ying, but with your heart in Han," then you will never be able to understand how much the workers and peasants love socialism, how much they believe in the leadership of the Communist Party, and how they are full of revolutionary vigor to build socialism. In this way, even if you earn first-class labor points, how can you say that your pulse is beating together with the workers and peasants? If you do not make up your mind to correct your attitude towards tempering yourself, the result will inevitably be nothing accomplished.
    Experience proves that labor is an important method of transforming thought. But to truly transform and temper one's thought well, in addition to actively participating in labor, it is even more important to give your heart to the Party, give your heart to the agricultural cooperative, and make up your mind to settle down in the countryside. Do not make temporary calculations of a year and a half. Only by constantly caring about the masses, loving what the laboring people love, and hating what the laboring people hate, can you thoroughly transform your thoughts in labor and get comprehensive tempering. Only in this way can you be tempered into a state cadre who is loyal to the cause of socialism and truly has the qualifications of a laboring peasant.

    怎样才算具有劳动农民的资格
    余志明同志在信中提到：论业务、好坏我是有一套的，只要经过一年半载，取得劳动农民的资格后，便符合党所要求又红又专的干部条件。从这句话里，我们可以看到他对这一问题的认识，不但片面，而且有根本性的错误。取得劳动农民的资格，不比一个学生在学校经过学习，取得一张毕业文凭那样简单具体，它的含意是很复杂而深远的。因此当你经过一段时间的劳动后，农民也决不会发给你任何具有劳动农民资格的凭证。举例说吧：如果一个下放干部对周围群众所关心的大小事情无动于衷，对六万万人的未来幸福毫不在意，处处只在个人的小天地里兜圈子的话，那怕你一年三百六十五天，埋头在地里经受日晒、雨淋或雪浸，而与劳动人民的思想感情仍然会格格不入。因此，虽然你经过了很长时间的劳动，也不能说明你已经取得了劳动农民的资格。
    又如当去年5月间资产阶级右派猖狂地向党向人民进攻的时候，为什么工人农民能坚决起来维护党的利益，而许多知识分子对右派言论反而会起共鸣呢？这说明工农的思想感情与知识分子比较，是有根本性的区别的。如果你在劳动中，只是白天做农民，晚上依然做那资产阶级式的知识分子，不愿意联系群众，不肯做社会工作仍然是“身在曹营，心在汉”，那你就根本体会不到工农是何等热爱社会主义，何等相信共产党的领导，如何鼓足革命干劲建设社会主义的思想感情。这样，那怕你挣得了一等劳动力的工分，又怎能说明你的脉搏已和工农在一起跳动了呢？如果你不下决心端正锻炼态度，结果必然会一事无成。
    经验证明劳动是改造思想的重要方法。但真正要把思想改造好、锻炼好，除了积极参加劳动以外，更重要的是要把心交给党、把心交给农业社，下决心在农村落户，不要去打那一年半载的临时算盘。只有时时刻刻关心群众，爱劳动人民之所爱，恨劳动人民之所恨，才能在劳动中彻底改造自己的思想，得到全面的锻炼。也只有这样，才能锻炼成忠实于社会主义事业、真正具有劳动农民资格的国家干部。
