    Revisionism and Modern Capitalism
    Soviet Union, Kuzminov
    In the present era, besides the capitalist system, there also exists a socialist world system, which is constantly developing and vividly displaying its tremendous superiority, thus making the position of the capitalist defenders increasingly difficult. This is understandable because life has shattered the arguments that the bourgeoisie used to defend in the past. The defenders of the capitalist system find themselves increasingly untenable, and therefore struggle desperately, trying to keep the masses under their influence.

    In the recent clamor made by bourgeois apologists to protect capitalism, the Marxist traitors, all sorts of revisionists, are particularly enthusiastic.

    Revisionism completely departs from Marxism, and it transmits bourgeois influence to the masses. The danger of revisionism lies in that revisionists adopt cunning disguises in the struggle against Marxism and socialism, posing as interpreters of Marxism and protectors of socialism. Disguise helps them deceive certain strata of the working class and exert some influence within them.

    One of the main issues in the struggle of the Communist and Workers' Parties against revisionists is the nature and development characteristics of modern capitalism. The starting point of Marxism-Leninism is: the development of capitalism and its basic characteristics and features is manifested as: the exploitation of the working people is intensified, the competition and anarchy of production is aggravated, and the labor-capital contradictions are deepened. Modern capitalism is monopoly capitalism, where the contradictions of capitalism and the struggle of hostile classes reach an extreme degree of acuteness.

    Revisionists distort Marxism, insisting that capitalism is gradually changing its basic characteristics: the competition and spontaneity of production are disappearing, the phenomenon of people exploiting people is being eliminated, profit is losing its stimulating effect, the concern for satisfying the requirements of the working people is beginning to play an increasingly important role, class boundaries and contradictions are being blurred, and the bourgeois state is becoming a supra-class institution, a tool for class reconciliation.

    Revisionists, right-wing Social Democratic theorists, believe that modern capitalism is changing its essence because "chunks" of socialism seem to be gradually growing within modern capitalism. To explain the nature of modern capitalism, they widely use the term "mixed economy". Monopoly capitalism is painted as: the boundaries between capitalism and socialism are disappearing, and even say that this is a new development of Marxism.

    The book "Modern Capitalism" by British Labour Party member John Strachey is one of the obvious examples of this kind of fabrication. Strachey said that he is an elucidator of Marxist doctrine. He wrote: "The basis of Marx's economic views is not wrong in the slightest. His political views are wrong. He has not been able to see such an important political force: this force has already grown up in developed capitalist countries, and will inevitably make the inherent tendencies of the system itself (that is, economic laws—Author's note)" balanced, and will eventually begin to transcend this trend. Strachey said, "These forces that lead to natural development changes in capitalism" will gradually change "the nature of capitalism and transform the entire capitalism" in the future. What are these forces? These are trade unions, cooperative organizations, the state, and so on. In other words, Strachey certainly believes that trade unions, the bourgeois state and other "political forces" may paralyze capitalist economic laws, change them, and make them ineffective, but without going beyond the capitalist category.

    It is very noteworthy how Strachey interprets the general law of capitalist accumulation. Strachey asserted, "If Marx, in his analysis, regarded his principle of the consequences of capitalist accumulation as a tendency rather than an unchanging 'law'..." this principle "might be correct rather than wrong". He then wrote, "...due to that extremely important extra-economic force that Marx did not see", this trend "began to fail". Therefore, Marx's principle of class polarization under capitalist conditions, the principle of the absolute impoverishment of the working people, and the principle of the intensification of exploitation of the proletariat are all considered outdated. Needless to say, this principle has nothing in common with Marxism.

    Capitalist economic laws, like all economic laws, are objective, and they embody existing relations of production. Therefore, the activities of trade unions, especially the activities of the bourgeois state that safeguards the interests of the exploiters, cannot paralyze or invalidate these economic laws within the capitalist economic category. The role of capitalist economic laws may of course change due to the specific conditions of development in different countries at different periods. People may recognize these laws and consider their role in their political and economic struggles. For example, the workers in capitalist countries, if conditions are favorable, may achieve the purpose of raising wages and improving working conditions through intense struggles; if the situation is unfavorable, they can only stop wages from falling. However, while pointing out that the economic struggle of the proletariat is of great significance for guaranteeing its living conditions, Marx emphasized that the working class in this situation "struggles only against the consequences, not against the causes that produce these consequences; it only stops the trend that worsens their conditions, but does not change the direction of this trend; it only takes painkillers, but does not cure the disease." Therefore, Marx instructed the working class to further develop and deepen the struggle against the bourgeoisie, and adopt revolutionary means to overthrow capitalism. However, Strachey and his ilk try to force the working class to have a reformist understanding of this struggle, thereby binding its power and tying it more tightly to the wheels of capitalism.

    Capitalist economic laws are not eternal, and they may exit the stage, but this is only possible after overthrowing the bourgeois regime by revolutionary means. Depending on the specific conditions and the actions of the bourgeoisie, this transformation may also be carried out in a peaceful manner in individual countries, but it does not mean that this is not a revolutionary transformation, because the original relations of production and the class structure of society will undergo fundamental changes. As a result, capitalist economic laws lose their validity. New economic laws—socialist economic laws—arise on the basis of socialist relations of production.

    This principle of Marxism-Leninism has been confirmed by the entire history of capitalist development and the revolutionary struggle of the working class, especially the practice of revolutionary struggle in the last fifty years. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has built socialism due to carrying out the socialist revolution, and is now victoriously and gradually transitioning to communism. The working people of many countries in Europe and Asia have embarked on the road to socialism.

    What is the result of the reformist road of "political force pressure" so greatly touted by reformists and revisionists, especially the reformists and revisionists in the most developed capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France and other countries? The result is first of all the strengthening of the dictatorship of large monopoly capital, the aggravation of the exploitation of the laboring masses, the deepening of the instability of the capitalist economy, the increasing rampant militarism, and the obvious sharpening of capitalist contradictions.

    Reformists and revisionists now pay special attention to state monopoly capitalism. They distort and unrealistically describe the relationship between monopoly capital and the state, starting from the argument that the bourgeois state is a decisive, independent supra-class force. Revisionists insist that the development of state monopoly capitalism makes monopoly capital increasingly subordinate to the state, which reflects the interests of the entire society. According to this statement, the bourgeois state can strictly restrict monopoly organizations, implement the planning of the national economy, and fight against the anarchy of production and crises; Professor Steiner of the United States said that it can also safeguard the interests of the "economically weak" and "oppose the strong", guarantee the increasingly broad participation of the working class in production management, guarantee their full employment, guarantee their constantly improving living standards, and so on.

    Needless to say, this has nothing in common with reality. The bourgeois state has always been an institution for the bourgeoisie to implement class rule and safeguard the interests of monopoly organizations and the capitalist system. In the era of imperialism, the bourgeois state machine is increasingly occupied by representatives of large monopoly organizations. The development of state monopoly capitalism is nothing more than the process of the bourgeois state machine becoming increasingly subordinate to monopoly organizations in order to increase profits and consolidate the rule of financial capital. The strengthening of state monopoly capitalism leads to the expansion and strengthening of the bourgeois state machine, leading to the strengthening of the darkest reactionary forces, imperialist oppression and dictatorship. The state machine in modern imperialist countries is a tool of monopoly capital, a tool for suppressing the revolutionary struggle of the working class and suppressing the national liberation struggle of the people of all countries.

    The revisionist and reformist arguments about the fundamental change in the nature of capitalism and the "fundamentally new" role of the capitalist state are closely linked to their principles about the path to the transition to socialism. They believe that the development of state monopoly capitalism is the path to the gradual transition to socialism. Revisionists believe that since socialism may mature within capitalism with the development of productive forces and the strengthening of the bourgeois state, that is to say, the transition to socialism is a slow gradual process of partial reform, rather than a revolutionary process; revolution is not only not in line with the laws, but also harmful; the dictatorship of the proletariat is also unnecessary.

    This argument is obviously contrary to the realistic prospects of building a socialist society, and its purpose is to lead the working class away from the correct path pointed out to them by Marxist-Leninist theory. Marxism-Leninism teaches that the development of state monopoly capitalism on the one hand shows that the socialization of capitalist production has reached a high level, and in fact also prepares the material conditions for socialism. But this does not mean that state monopoly capitalism is the way to transition to socialism, so it seems that there is no need for revolution. Lenin once waged an irreconcilable struggle against this kind of reformist argument, and he emphasized that the development of state monopoly capitalism does not mean that capitalism grows into socialism. The material conditions of socialism are increasingly maturing within the category of capitalism, but it is impossible to produce ready-made forms of socialist structure. Therefore, the transition from capitalism to socialism can only be achieved through the revolutionary path. And the working class seizing power, smashing the bourgeois state machine, and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat are indispensable conditions for carrying out socialist transformation in the economic field. However, revisionists, under the guise of socialism, praise the most reactionary forms of bourgeois dictatorship.

    When Britain took nationalization measures in certain industrial and transportation sectors, what a warm cry was issued by the defenders of capitalism! Isn't this the place where those temporarily flaunted "political forces" can show their power as tools for changing ownership? However, the problem is that this "political force" in capitalist society, that is, the state, is not in the hands of the workers, but in the hands of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the bourgeois nationalization implemented in Britain not only did not destroy, but on the contrary, consolidated the status of large capital ownership. Even Labour Party leader Gaitskell had to admit this in his pamphlet "Socialism and Nationalization".

    Gaitskell pointed out that workers are dissatisfied because the owners of nationalized enterprises receive huge compensation, and because the very owners who sat in the chairs of the board of directors of nationalized departments in the past are now sitting there, while the workers themselves are still far removed from production management as in the past.

    Right-wing social democratic groups still reiterate this whole set of "theories" again and again, shouting about implementing "capital democratization" by selling small shares to workers. However, years of experience have shown that issuing small shares among workers has not deprived a capitalist of ownership, nor has it made a worker a capitalist. In addition, this measure is used on the one hand to intensify the exploitation and deception of workers, and on the other hand, as a form of mobilizing capital and a means for capitalists to make a fortune.

    Now some people are talking a lot about the so-called "factory manager revolution" or "manager revolution". Theorists of the right-wing Social Democratic Party are trying to prove that capitalists seem to have become people who live solely on profits, and are no longer the owners of enterprises at all, but are replaced by employees such as managers and factory directors who are paid by the company and are not concerned about extracting profits. Indeed, the era of imperialism has turned small and medium shareholders and many small and medium business owners into empty owners. On the other hand, financial tycoons have seized greater power. As for managers and factory directors, they are all loyal servants of monopoly organizations, and most of them are large monopoly capitalists themselves.

    After the war, reformists and revisionists, for their own purposes, used the fact that capitalist production had certain growth and that the working class in some countries had achieved certain achievements in the struggle to improve their living standards. Theories of "permanent prosperity", "crisis-free capitalism", and so on have resurfaced. However, the economic crisis that is beginning in the United States once again shows that these "theories" are unfounded nonsense. Furthermore, although in some capitalist countries, workers have had their wages, which were greatly reduced during the war, raised after intense struggles, in many countries wages are still lower than before the war, and at the same time some other labor conditions have also deteriorated significantly. The economic crisis in the United States has already greatly worsened the situation of workers at the beginning: unemployment has increased sharply, labor intensity has increased, and real wages have fallen.

    The sharpening of the anti-revisionist struggle at the present stage is linked to the general crisis of capitalism and its deepening. Lenin wrote in 1908 that the proletariat and its party must wage a struggle against revisionism "on an infinitely greater scale", "because the proletarian revolution will sharpen all disputed issues, will concentrate all differences on the points that have the most direct significance for determining the actions of the masses, and will force us to distinguish between friends and enemies in the heat of the struggle, and to abandon those bad allies in order to give the enemy a fatal blow."

    Revisionism and reformism have also affected some wavering elements within the Communist and Workers' Parties. Revisionists within the communist movement attempt to slander Marxist-Leninist doctrine, whitewash capitalism, and undermine the working people's confidence in the need to transform capitalism and build socialism by revolutionary means. Revisionists distort Marxist-Leninist theory, attack the principle of proletarian internationalism, and do everything possible to undermine unity and weaken the power of the world socialist camp.

    The declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries announced to the world the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp, the socialist camp's loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, and emphasized the danger of revisionism. The declaration said, "While opposing dogmatism, the Communist Party believes that under the present conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism. It is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, it paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism."

    In today's sharpening ideological struggle, it is of great significance to constantly expose the conspiracies of the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, to treat all kinds of phenomena that deviate from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism irreconcilably, and to sharply and fundamentally criticize the revisionist practices of confusing right and wrong.

    The Communist and Workers' Parties are waging an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism, resolutely resisting all attempts to distort the revolutionary theory of the working class, and defending the purity of the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

    修正主义和现代资本主义
    苏联　库兹明诺夫
    在现时代，除了资本主义体系以外还存在着一个社会主义世界体系，这个体系在不断发展并且鲜明地显示出巨大的优越性，因而使资本主义卫护者的处境愈来愈困难了。这是可以理解的。因为生活粉碎了过去资产阶级进行辩护的那些论据。资本主义制度的卫护者觉得日益站不住脚了，因此就拚命挣扎，力图使群众处在他们的影响之下。
    在近年来资产阶级辩护人为保护资本主义而发出的叫嚣中，马克思主义的叛徒，形形色色的修正主义者，特别卖力气。
    修正主义完全脱离了马克思主义，它把资产阶级影响传导给群众。修正主义的危险在于：修正主义者在反对马克思主义和社会主义的斗争中采用了狡猾的伪装手段，装扮成马克思主义的阐述者和社会主义的保护人。伪装有助于他们欺骗工人阶级中的某些阶层并在其中产生某些影响。
    共产党和工人党反对修正主义者的斗争的主要问题之一是现代资本主义的本质和发展特性的问题。马克思列宁主义的出发点是：资本主义及其基本特征和特点的发展表现为：劳动人民受到的剥削加重，生产的竞争和无政府状态加剧，劳资矛盾加深。现代资本主义是垄断资本主义，这里资本主义的矛盾和敌对阶级的斗争达到极端尖锐的程度。
    修正主义者歪曲了马克思主义，硬说资本主义在逐渐改变其基本特征：生产的竞争和自发性在消失，人剥削人的现象在消除，利润失去刺激作用，对满足劳动人民要求的关怀开始起着越来越大的作用，阶级界限和矛盾在磨灭，资产阶级国家在变成超阶级机构，变成阶级调和的工具。
    修正主义者，右翼社会党理论家，认为现代资本主义正在改变它的本质，因为现代资本主义的内部似乎正在逐渐生长出整“块”的社会主义。为了说明现代资本主义的性质，他们广泛地采用“混合经济”这个术语。垄断资本主义被粉饰成为：资本主义同社会主义间的界限正在消失，甚至说这是马克思主义的新发展。
    英国工党党员约翰·斯特拉彻的“现代资本主义”一书就是这种捏造的明显例子之一。斯特拉彻说他是马克思学说的阐明者。他写道：“马克思的经济观点的基础没有丝毫错误。他的政治观点是错误的。他没有能够看到这样一种重要的政治力量：这种力量已经在发达的资本主义国家中成长起来，必然会使得制度本身固有的趋势（即经济规律——作者注）”平衡起来，而且终于会开始超越这种趋势。斯特拉彻说，“导致资本主义自然发展变化的这些力量”今后将逐渐改变“资本主义的本性，并且改造整个资本主义”。这是些什么力量呢？这就是工会、合作社组织、国家等等。换句话说，斯特拉彻肯定认为，工会、资产阶级国家和其他“政治力量”可能使资本主义经济规律瘫痪，改变它们，并且使它们不发生作用，不过不必越出资本主义范畴。
    斯特拉彻究竟怎样解释资本主义积累的一般规律，这是很值得注意的。斯特拉彻断言，“马克思在分析的时候假如把他关于资本主义积累的后果的原理看成是一种趋势而不是一种不变的‘规律’的话……”，这个原理“就可能是正确的而不是错误的了”。他接着写道，“……由于马克思所没有看到的那种极其重要的超经济力量”，这种趋势“开始不起作用了”。因此，马克思关于在资本主义条件下阶级两极化的原理、关于劳动人民绝对贫困化的原理和关于对无产阶级剥削加重的原理，都被认为是过时的了。不用说，这种原则同马克思主义没有任何共同之处。
    资本主义经济规律，正如所有经济规律一样，具有客观性，它们体现着现存的生产关系。所以工会的活动，特别是维护剥削者利益的资产阶级国家的活动，都不能使这些经济规律在资本主义经济范畴内瘫痪或失去作用。由于不同国家在各个时期发展的具体条件不同，资本主义经济规律的作用当然可能发生变化。人们可能认识这些规律并在自己的政治经济斗争中考虑它们的作用。例如，资本主义国家的工人，如果条件有利，就可能通过紧张的斗争来达到提高工资和改善劳动条件的目的，如果情况不利，只可能制止工资下降。但是，马克思在指出无产阶级的经济斗争对保证自己的生活条件具有重大意义的同时强调指出，工人阶级在这种情况下“斗争只是反对后果，而不是反对产生这些后果的原因；它只是制止使他们状况恶化的趋势，而不是改变这种趋势的方向；它只是服了止痛剂，而没有治好疾病”。因此，马克思指示工人阶级去进一步发展和深入反对资产阶级的斗争，采用革命的手段来推翻资本主义。而斯特拉彻之流却企图硬要工人阶级对这个斗争作改良主义的理解，从而束缚住它的力量，把它更紧地绑在资本主义的车轮上。
    资本主义经济规律不是永恒的，它可能退出舞台，但是只有用革命手段推翻资产阶级政权后才可能这样。根据具体条件和资产阶级的行动，这一转变在个别国家中也可能以和平方式进行，但是决不等于说因此这就不是革命的转变了，因为原来的生产关系和社会的阶级结构要起根本的变化。这样的结果，资本主义经济规律就丧失效力。在社会主义生产关系的基础上产生新的经济规律——社会主义经济规律。
    马克思列宁主义这一原理已经为资本主义发展的整个历史和工人阶级的革命斗争、特别是近五十年的革命斗争实践所证实。大家知道，苏联由于进行社会主义革命而建成社会主义，现在正在胜利地向共产主义逐步过渡。欧洲和亚洲许多国家的劳动人民已经走上了社会主义道路。
    改良主义者和修正主义者、尤其是最发达的资本主义国家如英国、美国、法国和其他国家的改良主义者和修正主义者所大肆吹嘘的
  “政治力量压力”的改良主义道路结果如何呢？结果首先是大垄断资本的独裁加强了，对劳动群众的剥削加重了，资本主义经济的不稳定性加深了，军国主义日益猖狂了，资本主义矛盾明显地尖锐起来了。
    改良主义者和修正主义者现在特别重视国家垄断资本主义。他们从关于资产阶级国家是决定性的、独立的超阶级力量这种论调出发，歪曲地、不真实地描述了垄断资本和国家的关系。修正主义者硬说，国家垄断资本主义的发展使垄断资本越来越服从于反映整个社会利益的国家。根据这种说法，资产阶级国家能够严格地限制垄断组织，贯彻国民经济的计划工作，同生产的无政府状态和危机作斗争；美国斯坦纳教授说，它还能维护“经济上弱者”的利益而“反对强者”，保证工人阶级日益广泛地参加生产管理，保证他们完全就业，保证他们生活水平不断提高等等。
    不用说，这同实际情况毫无共同之处。资产阶级国家过去和现在都是资产阶级实行阶级统治、维护垄断组织和资本主义制度的利益的机构。在帝国主义时代，资产阶级国家机器越来越被大垄断组织的代表所占据。国家垄断资本主义的发展，不外就是资产阶级国家机器日益从属于垄断组织以达到增加利润和巩固财政资本统治的目的的过程。国家垄断资本主义的加强导致资产阶级国家机器的膨胀和加强，导致最最黑暗的反动势力、帝国主义压迫和独裁的加强。现代帝国主义国家中的国家机器是垄断资本的工具，是镇压工人阶级革命斗争、镇压各国人民民族解放斗争的工具。
    修正主义者和改良主义者关于资本主义性质根本改变、关于资本主义国家的“原则上新的”作用的论点，同他们关于向社会主义过渡的道路的原理是紧密相连的。他们认为国家垄断资本主义的发展就是逐渐向社会主义过渡的道路。修正主义者认为，既然随着生产力的发展和资产阶级国家的加强、社会主义可能在资本主义内部成熟起来，那就是说，向社会主义过渡是一个局部改革的缓慢的渐变过程，而决不是一个革命的过程；革命非但不合规律，而且是有害的；无产阶级专政也没有必要。
    这种论断同建成社会主义社会的现实前景显然是矛盾的，其目的是要使工人阶级脱离马克思列宁主义理论给他们指出的正确道路。马克思列宁主义教导说，国家垄断资本主义的发展一方面表明资本主义生产的社会化达到了高度水平，而实际上也是为社会主义准备物质条件。但这决不是说，国家垄断资本主义就是过渡到社会主义的途径，因而好像就不需要进行革命了。列宁就曾经对这种改良主义的论调进行过不调和的斗争，他强调指出，国家垄断资本主义的发展并不意味着资本主义长入社会主义。在资本主义的范畴内社会主义的物质条件日益成熟，但是不可能产生现成的社会主义结构的形式。因此，从资本主义过渡到社会主义只能通过革命的道路。而工人阶级夺取政权、粉碎资产阶级国家机器、建立无产阶级专政，是在经济领域内进行社会主义改造的必不可少的条件。但是修正主义者却打着社会主义的幌子，极口赞扬资产阶级专政的最反动的形式。
    当英国在某些工业和交通运输部门采取国有化措施的时候，资本主义的辩护人发出了多么热烈的叫嚣！这不就是那些标榜一时的“政治力量”有可能作为改变所有制的工具而施展威风的场所吗？但是，一切问题在于，资本主义社会的这种“政治力量”、即国家，不是掌握在工人的手里，而是掌握在资产阶级的手里，因此，英国所实行的资产阶级国有化就不仅没有破坏、而相反地却巩固了大资本所有制的地位。就连工党领袖盖次克尔在他所写的小册子“社会主义与国有化”中也不得不承认这一点。
    盖次克尔指出，工人感到不满，因为国有化企业所有主领到巨额赔偿，还因为现在坐在国有化部门理事会交椅上的正是这些过去的所有主，而工人自己却一如往昔，被远远地排斥在生产管理之外。
    右派社会党集团直到现在还一而再、再而三地重弹这一整套的“理论”，高喊通过在工人中间推销小额股票的方法来实行“资本民主化”。但是，多年的经验表明，在工人中间发行小额股票并没有剥夺一个资本家的所有权，也没有使一个工人成为资本家。此外，这一措施一方面被利用来加紧剥削和欺骗工人，另一方面是作为动员资本的一种形式和资本家发财致富的一种手段。
    现在有人在大谈其所谓“厂长革命”或“经理革命”。右翼社会党的理论家企图证实，资本家好像已经成为光靠利润生活的人，已经完全不再是企业的所有者了，而由拿公司薪水的、对榨取利润不关心的经理和厂长这样一些职员代替了他们的位置。的确，帝国主义时代把中小股东以及许多中小企业主变成了空头的所有者。而另一方面，金融大王却攫取了更大的权力。至于说经理和厂长，他们都是垄断组织的忠实仆从，而且其中大多数人本身就是大垄断资本家。
    战后，改良主义者和修正主义者为了自己的目的，利用了资本主义生产有某些增长和一些国家的工人阶级在争取提高生活水平的斗争中取得了某些成就这一事实。“永久繁荣”、“无危机的资本主义”等等理论又重新抬头了。但是，美国正在开始的经济危机再次表明了这些“理论”是无根据的谰言。再说，虽然在一些资本主义国家里，工人经过紧张的斗争后，他们在战争期间大大降低了的工资有所提高，但在许多国家里工资还是低于战前，同时其他一些劳动条件也明显地恶化了。美国的经济危机在开始的时候就已经使工人的处境大大恶化：失业急剧增长，劳动强度加剧，实际工资下降。
    现阶段反修正主义斗争的尖锐化是同资本主义总危机及其加深联系着的。列宁在1908年写道，无产阶级及其政党一定要“在更大得无比的范围内”同修正主义进行斗争，“因为无产阶级革命将使一切争论的问题尖锐化，将把一切分歧都集中到对于决定群众行动有最直接意义的各点上，将迫使我们在斗争激烈时区分友敌，抛开那些恶劣的同盟者，以便给敌人以致命的打击。”
    修正主义和改良主义也对共产党和工人党内的一些不坚定分子发生了影响。共产主义运动内部的修正主义者企图诽谤马克思列宁主义学说，粉饰资本主义，破坏劳动人民对于必须以革命手段改造资本主义和建成社会主义的信心。修正主义者歪曲马克思列宁主义理论，攻击无产阶级国际主义原则，他们千方百计地破坏团结，削弱世界社会主义阵营的威力。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言向全世界宣布了社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结、社会主义阵营矢忠于马克思列宁主义，并且强调了修正主义的危险性。宣言中说，“在反对教条主义的同时，共产党认为，在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”
    在思想斗争尖锐化的今天，不断揭露马克思列宁主义敌人的阴谋诡计，不调和地对待形形色色脱离马克思列宁主义基本原理的现象，尖锐地、原则性地批评修正主义混淆是非的做法，有着巨大的意义。
    共产党和工人党同修正主义进行着不调和的斗争，坚决地反击一切歪曲工人阶级革命理论的企图，捍卫伟大的马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁。
