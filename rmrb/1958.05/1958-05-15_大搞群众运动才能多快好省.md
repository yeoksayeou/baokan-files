The fundamental issue in implementing the general line of socialist construction is to rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and launch large-scale mass movements. Only by launching large-scale mass movements can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our Shaanxi region has undergone a great rectification movement over the past year or so. The relationships between people have been greatly improved, and their thinking has been greatly liberated. Based on this, we have launched a vigorous mass movement, which has powerfully promoted the leap-forward development of socialist construction and demonstrated the enormous power of mass movements. Before liberation, only more than 3 million mu of irrigated land were built over thousands of years. In the eight years after liberation, only more than 6 million mu of irrigated land were built. However, in the magnificent water conservancy movement of last winter and this spring, more than 15 million mu were built, which is equivalent to an increase of more than one mu of irrigated land for each rural person in the province. The Hanzhong Special District achieved water conservancy in less than a month. In the mass movement for agricultural technology reform, "living Lubans" emerged everywhere. In the Guanzhong area alone, the masses created and invented more than 2,000 kinds of improved agricultural tools, covering everything from sowing to harvesting and from mountainous areas to plains. Agricultural cultivation techniques have been further improved, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected this year. The mass movement for running industries by the whole people has been widely launched, and more than 3,000 small factories and mines have been newly established in a very short period of time. The output value of the original state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines increased by 27.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. Reports of new records being created and old quotas being broken are coming in every day. The experience of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School in carrying out the work-study program has been widely promoted. The movement to eliminate illiteracy and eliminate the "four pests," as well as the self-remolding movement of intellectuals, are being carried out extensively and deeply. Whether in urban or rural areas, in government offices or enterprises, in schools or in the army, a thriving scene has emerged everywhere, filled with joyous songs.

At present, the Party organizations and people in the Shaanxi region, inspired by the general line of socialist construction, are fighting to achieve the "Twenty Striving Goals for Changing the Face of the Entire Province in Three Years." Within three years, our production of grain, cotton, and oil crops will more than double, and the production and income of agricultural cooperatives will exceed those of local well-to-do middle peasants. The cultural and technical level of the broad masses will be generally improved. Every cooperative will have eight personnel (agricultural technicians, water conservancy technicians, forestry and horticulture workers, agricultural machinery workers, midwives, health workers, veterinarians, and breeding workers). Every township will have a middle school, every cooperative will have a primary school, there will be no illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and there will be no "four pests" in urban and rural areas. By 1962, the output value of local industry can exceed that of agriculture, the foundation for the industrialization of the entire province can be laid, agricultural cultivation can be basically mechanized, most rural areas can be electrified, and the "no need for cattle to cultivate land, no need for oil to light lamps" that the peasant masses have been looking forward to will become a reality in most areas.

In order to promote the leap forward in social productivity and promote the upsurge of the technological and cultural revolutions, we must follow the mass line and launch large-scale mass movements. The mass line, where everyone participates in matters that concern everyone, is a fundamental line for us to accomplish any revolutionary task and also a fundamental line for carrying out socialist construction. And launching large-scale mass movements is the main method of accomplishing revolutionary and construction tasks, and also the main form of following the mass line. Some people believe that mass movements can be launched on a large scale during the revolutionary period, but it seems that mass movements are not needed or impossible to launch on a large scale during the construction period. This view is obviously wrong. Revolution is a matter for millions upon millions of the masses themselves, and construction is also a matter for millions upon millions of the masses themselves. We should maximize the strength and wisdom of the masses and launch large-scale mass movements. If we want to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, and if we want to seize time and compare speeds with imperialism, it will not work to do things slowly and step by step. Only by boosting our energy, breaking with conventions, and fully exerting people's subjective initiative can we promote the overall leap forward in construction. And launching large-scale mass movements is precisely the main method of fully exerting people's role and ensuring that socialism is built more, faster, better, and more economically. Especially today's masses of people, who have been liberated economically, politically, and ideologically, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and their subjective initiative in transforming nature has increased a thousandfold, the power of mass movements is even more powerful. Countless facts prove that only by launching large-scale mass movements can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economically; without launching large-scale mass movements, we will achieve less, slower, worse, and more expensively. As long as we fully and deeply mobilize the masses and launch large-scale mass movements, things that could not be done in the past for many years can be done in a short period of time, or even in just a few days. From the period after cooperativization to before last winter, because water conservancy construction did not form a widespread and deep mass movement, the result was that the entire province only expanded irrigation by 3.61 million mu in one year and nine months, and each mu required an average of more than two yuan of state investment. But last winter and this spring, a mass water conservancy movement was launched on a large scale, and more than 15 million mu were irrigated in seven months, and the state did not spend much money. Habits such as people and livestock living together, people not having toilets, and stoves not having chimneys, which were left over from history in the Hanzhong Special District, could not be changed for a long time. Recently, a movement to change customs and habits was launched, and 95 percent of peasant households have achieved separation of people and livestock. Some townships achieved people having toilets and pigs and cattle having pens in two or three days. Other work, such as streamlining institutions and eliminating the "four pests," has not achieved significant results until a massive mass movement has been formed.

Some people also believe that mass movements can be launched to lead agricultural production, but it seems that mass movements cannot be launched to lead industrial production; class struggle can launch mass movements, but technological revolution cannot launch mass movements. Some people even sigh, "When will the wind of movement stop?" These views are also incorrect. Different methods should be adopted to solve problems of different natures. Leading industrial production should be different from agricultural production; carrying out technological revolution should be different from class struggle. This is certain. However, mobilizing the masses and pooling the wisdom of the masses is a fundamental method. In factories and mines, launching large-scale mass movements will not only not affect the completion of production plans, but will also promote the early completion or overfulfillment of production plans; it will not only not hinder the necessary balanced production, but will also help active balanced production. Facts have proved that the rectification movement, the increase production and practice economy movement, and the advanced producer movement in factories and mines have all played a great role in improving production. As for the technological revolution, we must also follow the mass line and launch large-scale mass movements. We must not only attach importance to the role of experts, but also attach importance to the strength and wisdom of the broad masses; experts cannot be separated from the masses, otherwise, it is impossible to become true experts. At present, the agricultural tool reform movement that is widely carried out throughout the province is developing from the masses, and thousands of "living Lubans" have also emerged from the workers and peasants. This also shows that only by launching large-scale mass movements can a large number of inventions and creations be produced for the technological revolution.

Some people ridicule us as "eating by relying on movement" and being "athletes." Yes! We are precisely relying on mass movements to build a better socialist society, and we are precisely striving to be pioneers in the socialist construction movement. We Communists have always been proponents of continuous revolution. In the past, during the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, it was one task after another, one movement after another; now, during the socialist construction period, during the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, it is still one task after another, one movement after another. In the past, we relied on mass movements to win the victory of the revolution; in the future, we will still rely on mass movements to win the victory of construction.

To launch mass movements, we must be specific, clear, and enthusiastic. As early as 1920, Chairman Mao pointed out that any movement in human society should have three conditions: specificity, clarity, and enthusiasm. Chairman Mao's thesis still has great practical significance today. In order to achieve these requirements, judging from the current situation of mass movements in the Shaanxi region, what should be emphasized at present is:

The tasks should be clear, the measures should be specific, and we should be good at concentrating the most universal and urgent demands of the vast majority of the masses. Chairman Mao's "Eleven Movements" launched in 1944 calling on the people of Yan'an City—each household having more than one year of surplus grain; each district having a blacksmith shop, each township having a blacksmith stove; each township having a private school and night school, a literacy group and reading group; each district having a health cooperative; each household planting and surviving one hundred trees, etc.—is an example. Based on this spirit, we put forward the "Twenty Striving Goals for Changing the Face of the Entire Province in Three Years" this year, which quickly became a household name and an action slogan for everyone to do. The Shangluo Special District's movement of planting one liter of walnuts and one hundred economic forest trees per household quickly overfulfilled its task because the tasks were clear and the measures were specific. If the tasks are not clear, the measures are not specific, or there are only advanced indicators but no specific and effective measures, the movement will often easily form a situation that is superficially vigorous but actually empty.

The movement should have planning and rhythm, and always pay attention to maintaining the vigorous emotions of the masses. This year, Ankang County, in terms of agricultural production, planned twenty "battles" in accordance with the spirit of the overall leap forward, including water conservancy, accumulating manure, spring plowing, summer harvesting and planting, autumn harvesting and planting, and eliminating the "four pests," and paid attention to appropriately adjusting the high tide and intermission of the movement, the battle and rest, and the rush work and regular work. Doing so will help maintain the vigorous emotions of the masses and make the development of the movement enthusiastic and powerful. If we do not pay attention to the necessary rest and do not cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, the movement cannot develop healthily.

Widely organize competitions and correctly promote the collective sense of honor of the masses. Create an atmosphere where everyone strives to be advanced and everyone catches up with the advanced, so that the movement is widespread, deep, lively, and colorful. In the competition, the role of establishing advanced banners is very important; breaking through weak links and allowing latecomers to surpass the former is also very important, which can not only give the laggards enough energy, but also promote the advanced to be more advanced. Like the old revolutionary base areas in northern Shaanxi, the progress of work was relatively slow in the past, but since last year, there have been significant changes in the work. The masses in the Yulin Special District fought hard for a month in minus 20 degrees, digging 400,000 drought wells. Yulin County has seen a large area of high-yield ditches with a yield of 1,000 catties per mu, and Yan'an Special District has become the first "four noes" special district in the province, which has greatly promoted the work of other regions in the province. Organizing competitions should focus on praising the advanced and disseminating advanced experience. Praising the advanced is actually criticizing and motivating the backward, and it will not frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses. The masses call it "civilized criticism." Organizing competitions should not only compare speed and quantity, but also compare quality and economy, advocate not seeking empty fame, pay attention to reality, and prevent formalism.

The above is just a simple explanation of some issues on how to make the mass movement specific, clear, and enthusiastic. Of course, the fundamental issue in carrying out the mass movement well is the issue of Party leadership. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the issue of strengthening political and ideological work, first of all, the issue of liberating the minds of cadres and the masses. Crush the conservative formula of "dare not think—do not think—dare not think" and "cannot do—do not do—cannot do," and advocate boldly thinking and doing things boldly. If those old brains, old rules, old styles, old habits, and old paces cannot be discarded, then new ideas, new rules, new styles, new creations, and new energy cannot be developed. Without ideological liberation, one dares not create and cannot leap forward. We must also be good at turning the Party's resolutions into the actions of the broad masses, oppose any form of coercion and commandism, and more widely adopt the methods of great airing of views, great debate, and big-character posters, and advocate what to do, what to debate, and constantly improve the masses' awareness of participating in the movement, and constantly give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, so that the masses feel that the more they do, the more interested they are, and the more they do, the more energetic they are.

　　大搞群众运动才能多快好省
　　中共陕西省委员会第一书记　张德生
    贯彻执行建设社会主义总路线的一个根本问题，就是依靠群众，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动。只有大搞群众运动，才能多快好省。在中央和毛主席的正确领导下，我们陕西地区一年多以来，经过了伟大的整风运动，人们的相互关系大大地改善了，思想大大解放了，并在这个基础上，开展了热火朝天的群众运动，有力地促进了社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，显示了群众运动的巨大威力。解放前几千年只修了三百多万亩水地，解放后八年也只修了六百多万亩水地，而在去冬今春规模壮阔的水利运动中，就修了一千五百多万亩，等于全省每个农村人口新增加了一亩多水地，汉中专区不到一个月就实现了水利化。在群众性的农业技术改革运动中，“活鲁班”到处涌现，仅关中地区群众创造发明的各式各样的改良农具就有两千多种，从播种到收割、从山区到平原都有了改良农具。农业耕作技术有了进一步改进，今年小麦大丰收大有希望。全民办工业的运动，已经广泛展开，在很短的时间内，新办起了三千多个小型厂矿。原有的国营和地方国营厂矿，今年第一季度产值比去年同期增长了百分之二十七点九。每天都有创造新纪录、冲破旧定额的捷报。西安第一航空技工学校开展勤工俭学运动的经验已经普遍推广。扫除文盲和消灭“四害”以及知识分子的自我改造运动等正在广泛、深入地开展着。无论城市和农村，机关和企业，学校和军队，到处都出现了欣欣向荣的景象，洋溢着欢乐的歌声。
    目前，陕西地区的党组织和人民群众，正在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，为实现“苦战三年改变全省面貌的二十条奋斗目标”而战斗着。三年内，我们的粮食、棉花和油料的产量将增加一倍以上，农业社的生产和收入将超过当地富裕中农；广大群众的文化技术水平将普遍提高，社社有八员（农业技术员、水利技术员、林艺园艺员、农械员、接生员、保健员、兽医员、配种员），乡乡有中学，社社有小学，青壮年无文盲，城乡无“四害”。地方工业产值到一九六二年可以超过农业产值，全省工业化的基础就可以奠定了，农业耕作基本上实现机械化，大部分农村电力化，农民群众盼望的“耕地不用牛，点灯不用油”，在大多数地区将会变成现实。
    为了促进社会生产力的跃进，促进技术革命和文化革命的高涨，就必须走群众路线，大搞群众运动。走群众路线，大家的事大家办，这是我们实现任何革命任务的一条根本路线，也是进行社会主义建设的一条根本路线。而大搞群众运动正是完成革命和建设任务的主要方法，也是走群众路线的主要形式。有人认为，在革命时期，可以大搞群众运动，在建设时期，似乎不需要或者不可能大搞群众运动了。这种看法显然是错误的。革命是千百万群众自己的事，建设同样是千百万群众自己的事，都应当最大限度发挥群众的力量和智慧，大搞群众运动。我们要多快好省地建设社会主义，要同帝国主义抢时间、比速度，慢腾腾地、按步就班地办事情是不行的，只有鼓起干劲，打破常规，充分发挥人的主观能动性，才能促进建设事业的全面跃进。而大搞群众运动，正是充分发挥人的作用，保证多快好省地建设社会主义的主要方法。特别是今天的人民群众，已经在经济上、政治上和思想上得到了解放，敢想敢说，敢作敢为，在改造自然中的主观能动作用千百倍地增长了，群众运动的力量就显得更加强大。无数事实证明：只有大搞群众运动，才能多快好省；不大搞群众运动，就会少慢差费；只要充分深入地发动群众，大搞群众运动，过去多少年办不到的事情，在短时间内甚至只要几天就办到了。我们在合作化以后到去年冬季以前，由于兴修水利没有形成广泛深入的群众运动，结果全省一年零九个月只扩灌了三百六十一万亩，每亩平均还要国家投资两元多；而去冬今春大搞了群众性的水利运动，七个月就扩灌了一千五百多万亩，国家并没有花多少钱。汉中专区历史上遗留下来的人畜同居、人无厕所、灶无烟囱等习惯，长期不能改变，最近开展了移风易俗运动，百分之九十五的农户实现了人畜分居，有些乡两三天就实现了人有厕所、猪牛有圈。其它如精简机构、消灭“四害”等工作，没有一项不是在形成了声势浩大的群众运动后，才收到了宏伟的成果。
    也有人认为，领导农业生产可以搞群众运动，领导工业生产似乎不能搞群众运动；阶级斗争可以搞群众运动，技术革命不能搞群众运动，甚至有人慨叹“运动之风何时了”，这些看法也是不正确的。解决不同性质的问题，应当采取不同的方法，搞工业生产应当不同于农业生产；搞技术革命应当不同于阶级斗争，这是肯定的。但是，发动群众，群策群力，却是一个根本的方法。在厂矿中，大搞群众运动，不仅不会影响生产计划的完成，而且会促进生产计划提前完成或超额完成；不仅不会妨碍必要的均衡生产，而且有助于积极的均衡生产。事实证明，厂矿中的整风运动、增产节约运动和先进生产者运动，都对提高生产起了很大的作用。至于技术革命，同样要走群众路线，大搞群众运动。既要重视专家的作用，更要重视广大群众的力量和智慧；专家也不能脱离群众，否则，就不可能成为真正的专家。目前，在全省范围内广泛开展的农具改革运动，正是从群众中发展起来的，成千上万个“活鲁班”也是从工农群众中涌现出来的。这又说明，进行技术革命，只有大搞群众运动，才能够产生大量的发明创造。
    有人讥笑我们是“靠运动吃饭”，是“运动员”。是的！我们正是要靠群众运动来建设美好的社会主义社会，我们正是要当个社会主义建设运动的先锋队员。我们共产党人从来就是不断革命论者，过去，在民主革命时期和社会主义革命时期，是一个任务接着一个任务，一个运动接着一个运动；现在，在社会主义建设时期，在技术革命和文化革命时期，仍然是一个任务接着一个任务，一个运动接着一个运动。过去，我们依靠群众运动，赢得了革命的胜利；今后，我们还要依靠群众运动，去赢得建设的胜利。
    搞群众运动，必须做到具体、鲜明、热烈。毛主席远在一九二○年就曾经指出：人类社会中无论那一种运动，都应该具有具体、鲜明、热烈这三个条件。毛主席的这一论断，至今仍有重大的实际意义。为了达到这些要求，从陕西地区群众运动的现状来看，当前应当强调的是：
    任务要明确，措施要具体，要善于集中最大多数群众最普遍、最迫切的要求。一九四四年毛主席号召延安市人民开展的“十一运动”——每户有一年余粮；每区一个铁匠铺，每乡一个铁匠炉；每乡一个民办学校和夜校，一个识字组和读报组；每区一个卫生合作社；每户种活一百棵树等——就是一个范例。我们根据这种精神，在今年提出了“苦战三年改变全省面貌的二十条奋斗目标”，很快就成了家喻户晓、人人动手的行动口号。商雒专区每户种一升核桃和一百棵经济林木的运动，就是由于任务明确、措施具体，很快地超额完成了任务。如果任务不明确，措施不具体，或者只有先进的指标，而没有具体有效的措施，运动就往往容易形成表面上轰轰烈烈，实际上空空洞洞。
    运动要有规划，有节奏，始终注意保持群众旺盛的情绪。安康县今年在农业生产方面，根据全面跃进的精神，规划了水利、积肥、春耕、夏收夏种、秋收秋播、除“四害”等二十个“战斗”，并且对运动的高潮与间歇、战斗与休整，突击工作与经常工作，注意了适当地调节。这样做，就会有利于保持群众的旺盛情绪，使运动的发展热烈、有力。如果不注意必要的休整，不爱护群众的热情，运动就不可能健康的发展。
    广泛地组织比赛，正确地发扬群众的集体荣誉感。造成处处争先进、人人赶先进的风气，使运动广泛深入、有声有色。在比赛中，树立先进旗帜的作用很大；突破薄弱环节，使后来者居上，作用也很大，它既能给后进的鼓足干劲，又能促进先进的更加先进。像陕北老区，过去一个时期工作进展比较迟缓，但在去年以来，工作有了显著变化，榆林专区群众去冬在零下二十多度，奋战一月，打成旱井四十万眼。榆林县出现了亩产千斤的大面积丰产沟，延安专区成为全省第一个“四无”专区，对全省其它地区的工作起了很大的促进作用。组织比赛，要着重表扬先进，传播先进经验。表扬先进实际上又是批评和激励落后，并且不致挫伤群众的积极性，群众把它叫做“文明的批评”。组织比赛，既要比多快，又要比好省，提倡不务虚名，讲求实际，防止形式主义。
    上面只是简单说明如何使群众运动做到具体、鲜明、热烈的一些问题。当然，搞好群众运动的根本问题，还是党的领导问题。这里值得特别提出的是加强政治思想工作问题，首先是解放干部和群众的思想问题。粉碎那种“不敢想——不去想——不敢想”和“办不到——不去办——办不到”的保守主义的公式，提倡大胆地想、放手地干。那些老脑筋、老规矩、老作风、老习惯、老步伐丢不掉，新思想、新章程、新风格、新创造、新干劲就兴不开。思想不解放，就不敢创造，不能跃进。还要善于把党的决议变成广大群众的行动，反对任何形式的强迫命令，更加广泛地采用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方式，提倡做什么，鸣辩什么，不断地提高群众参加运动的自觉性，不断地发挥群众的创造性和积极性，使群众感到越干越有兴味，越干越有劲头。
