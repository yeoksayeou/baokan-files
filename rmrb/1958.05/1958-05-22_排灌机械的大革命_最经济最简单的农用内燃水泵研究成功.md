Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: An economical and simple irrigation and drainage power machine most suitable for agriculture in our country – the internal combustion water pump – has been successfully researched and trial-produced. This is a major revolution in irrigation and drainage machinery in our country. Its widespread use will greatly accelerate the development of agricultural water conservancy mechanization in our country.

This agricultural internal combustion water pump, called the parallel double-cylinder short-tube short-stroke type, is completely different from other water pumps driven by gas engines, diesel engines, locomobiles, and gasoline engines. It has no separate power machine, nor a separate water pump, but is designed using the principle of directly using the force of gas combustion and explosion in the water pipe to push the water to a higher place. According to the records obtained in the preliminary tests of the first internal combustion water pump that has been made, under the condition of a water lifting height of 4.5 meters, it can discharge 200 tons of water per hour, consuming about 1.5 kilograms of anthracite coal. It is estimated that at a water lifting height of 10 meters, its water pumping capacity is equivalent to that of a 25-horsepower gas engine driving a water pump, while fuel consumption is only one-half to one-third of that of the gas engine, and the thermal efficiency is higher than that of any kind of thermal engine – whether steam engine or internal combustion engine driving a water pump.

The structure of this water pump is very simple. In addition to the gas generator, the machine itself is basically a cylinder head equivalent to that of an internal combustion engine and a water pipe. Many complex transmission mechanisms and centrifugal water pumps such as pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, flywheels, etc., are all omitted.

The machine is also very convenient to operate. People only need to shake the air drum once to inject gas into the cylinder, and then pull its ignition device (the power source is a simple carbon-zinc primary battery), and the machine will start. From then on, it will "manage itself," and the work of intake, compression, ignition, explosion, and exhaust of waste gas will be automatic. The machine's movement is stable and gentle, but the water output is as turbulent as a waterfall.

Because this water pump has a simple structure and no friction from any transmission machinery, the machine is not easily damaged. Manufacturing is also very easy. The materials used are mainly pig iron (of which cast iron pipes, which account for 80% of the total weight of the machine, can also be replaced with ceramic or cement pipes after testing). No alloy steel is used, and there are no parts that require precision machining. The machine's "food" is also wide-ranging; anthracite, charcoal, firewood, biogas, etc. can all be burned. No engine oil is needed either. Therefore, its economy is far superior to water pumps driven by gas engines, diesel engines, locomobiles, etc.

The results of research and experimentation also show that this internal combustion water pump is not only the most ideal irrigation and drainage machine for rural areas in our country, but can also be developed into a piston-less "hydraulic transmission type" internal combustion engine, providing the vast rural areas of our country with a most economical and convenient source of thermal energy. It can be used to drive water turbines for agricultural and sideline processing such as grinding flour and cutting grass. If a generator is installed on the water turbine, it can generate electricity. It can be used as a booster for hydroelectric power stations in the dry season to ensure full-load power generation throughout the year. Even in areas lacking water sources, this method can be used to build a pool and use an internal combustion water pump to extract water from the pool to directly impinge on the water turbine for hydroelectric power generation. The water after power generation is then allowed to flow back into the pool. If it is installed on a ship, changing the water lifting to spraying water from the stern will make it a "jet-propelled ship." Experts who inspected the design and testing of this internal combustion water pump pointed out that this internal combustion water pump breaks away from the old circle of the world's existing two major categories of thermal engines (piston type, turbine type), using liquid (water) transmission to replace complex mechanical transmission. As far as the transmission mechanism of the engine is concerned, this is a revolution.

People are full of confidence that as long as they continue to intensify experiments and research, conduct tests for various uses, and widely manufacture and use it, this new type of engine will make a significant contribution to the mechanization and electrification of rural areas in our country.

This internal combustion water pump was trial-produced by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, according to the plan researched and designed by Professor Dai Guirui of Changchun Automotive Tractor College, and under his guidance.

After the recent success of this internal combustion water pump, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission Nie Rongzhen, Acting Director of the National Technology Commission Han Guang, Deputy Director Zhang Youxuan, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Liu Ding, and First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Wang Renzhong and First Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Jianxun, who are attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, all went to visit the demonstration.

It is reported that, according to the spirit of Vice Premier Nie's instructions on the scene, the First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to immediately concentrate a group of technical forces to establish a special organization to further study this internal combustion water pump and carry out the work of finalizing the design and serial design. In these few days, a group of technicians have been gathered to rush to make drawings, ready to be distributed to provinces and cities for widespread trial production. Use it on one hand, and research on the other. Beijing has decided to first replicate two units. (Attached picture)

### 排灌机械的大革命  最经济最简单的农用内燃水泵研究成功

    排灌机械的大革命
    最经济最简单的农用内燃水泵研究成功
    据新华社20日讯　新华社记者报道：一种最适合我国农业使用的经济而简单的排灌动力机械——内燃水泵，已经研究试制成功。这是我国排灌机械上的一项重大革命，它的广泛的使用，将要大大加速我国农村水利机械化事业的发展。
    这种称做并列双缸短管短程式的农用内燃水泵，同其他用煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机、汽油机带动的水泵，完全不同。它没有单独的动力机，也没有单独的水泵，而是利用燃气在水管中燃烧爆炸的力量，直接把水冲向高处的原理来进行设计的。根据目前已经做出的第一台内燃水泵在初步试验中获得的纪录，在打水高度为四点五公尺的条件下，它每小时可以出水二百吨，耗无烟煤约一点五公斤；估计，在打水高度为十公尺时，它相当于二十五马力煤气机带动水泵的抽水能力，而燃料消耗只相当于煤气机的二分之一至三分之一，热效率比任何一种热力发动机——蒸汽机和内燃机带动的水泵，都要高得多。
    这种水泵的结构很简单。除了煤气发生炉以外，机器本身基本上就是一个相当于内燃机的汽缸盖和一个水管。活塞、连杆、曲轴、飞轮等等许多复杂的传动机构和离心水泵，全部省掉了。
    机器操作起来也很方便。人们只要摇动一次风鼓，把煤气打进气缸里面，接着拉一下它的点火装置（电源是简单的炭锌原电池），机器就开动起来，从此，它就会“自己管理自己”，进气、压缩、点火爆炸和排除废气等工作都是自动的。机器的动作平稳、和缓，但出水就像瀑布那样汹涌。
    由于这种水泵结构简单，没有任何传动机械的摩擦，因而机器不容易损坏。制造也很容易，所用的材料主要是生铁（其中占全部机器重量80％的铸铁管，还可以经过试验，采用陶瓷或者洋灰管子代替）。完全不用合金钢，没有需要精密加工的零件。机器的“食料”也很广，无烟煤、木炭、木柴、沼气等都可以烧。也不用机油。因此，它的经济性要远远超过煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机等所带动的水泵。
    研究试验的结果还表明，这种内燃水泵不仅是我国农村最理想的排灌机械，而且还可以发展成为一种无活塞的“液压传动式”内燃发动机，为我国广大农村提供一种最经济而简便的热能动力。它可以用来推动水轮机进行磨面、铡草等农副业加工，如果在水轮机上装上个发电机，就可以发电。它可以作为水力发电站在枯水季节的加力设备，保证全年满负荷发电。甚至在缺乏水源的地方，也可以按这种方法，搞一个水池，利用内燃水泵从水池中提水直接冲击水轮机，进行水力发电。发完电的水又让它流回水池里面。如果把它装在船上，将提水改为从船尾喷水，就成为“喷水式轮船”。考察了这台内燃水泵的设计和试验的专家指出：这种内燃水泵，跳出了世界上现有两大类热力发动机（活塞式、涡轮式）的旧圈子，用液体（水）传动代替了复杂的机械传动。就发动机的传动机构说来，这是一个革命。
    人们满怀信心地认为，只要继续加紧进行试验研究，进行适用于各种用途的试验，广为制造使用，那么，这种新型的发动机对我国农村机械化和电气化将要作出重大贡献。
    这种内燃水泵是按照长春汽车拖拉机学院戴桂蕊教授研究设计的方案，并在他指导下在第一机械工业部北京农业机械研究所试制成功的。
    这台内燃水泵在最近取得成功后，国务院副总理兼科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻、国家技术委员会代主任韩光、副主任张有萱，第一机械工业部副部长刘鼎以及正在北京参加中共八大二次会议的中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、中共广西僮族自治区第一书记刘建勋等人，都前往参观表演。
    据悉，第一机械工业部根据聂副总理在现场指示的精神，已经决定立即集中一批技术力量，成立专门的机构，对这种内燃水泵作进一步研究并且进行定型设计和系列设计的工作。这几天，已经集中了一批技术人员赶制图纸，准备分发到各省市供各地广泛试制。一面使用，一面研究。北京市已经决定先仿制两台。（附图片）
