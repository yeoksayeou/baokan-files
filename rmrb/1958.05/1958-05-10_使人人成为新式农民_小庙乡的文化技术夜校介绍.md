Make Everyone a New Type of Farmer
—Introduction to the Cultural and Technical Night School in Xiaomiao Township
Hubei Daily Reporter Nie Bin

Three years ago, Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County was rife with illiteracy and backward production techniques. When it came to establishing agricultural cooperatives, the entire township couldn't find a single accountant. At that time, people not only didn't believe in advanced cotton planting techniques, but also considered cotton pests as "heavenly fire."

Over the past three years, the cultural and technical night school has thoroughly changed this backward situation in Xiaomiao Township, ushering in a new rural landscape, which is truly:

Cultural and technical flowers bloom, cotton yields soar.
Labor fills the fields, song and dance fill the villages;
By day, they are farmers, by night, they enter school;
Hard work plus diligence, a guarantee for the Great Leap Forward.

In today's Xiaomiao Township, if you want to understand production techniques, you can traverse the entire township and hear everyone, from teenagers to people in their seventies, talk about them extensively. If you want to see cultural activities, young girls can immediately tie red and green ribbons around their waists and start singing and dancing. Every day at dusk, men and women, young and old, three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, carry their satchels and go to school with smiles on their faces.

The cultural and technical night school equips all the working people of the township with cultural and technical knowledge. In the past, the agricultural cooperatives couldn't find a single accountant. Now, four hundred and forty-nine people can serve as accountants, some of whom have become night school teachers. Another one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine people have improved from being completely illiterate to semi-literate, able to recognize and write "one form" (members' work point record), "two books" (economic handbook, labor handbook), "three tickets" (grain, oil, and cloth tickets), and "four notes" (receipts, disbursements, loans, and withdrawal slips). With the masses mastering culture, their lives have also become more joyful. The masses say that in the past, they were blind to the world, but today they can see the world at a glance (reading newspapers). There are one hundred and fourteen newspaper reading groups throughout the township, reading newspapers year-round. There are also fifteen clubs, twenty-eight creative writing groups, and four hundred and eighteen actors, who constantly create and perform their own plays and songs. Especially in terms of production techniques, a complete set of technical knowledge and operational methods for the cotton growing process has been mastered by every worker, who can also explain the scientific principles. People have thoroughly understood a set of laws regarding cotton fertilization, pest control, irrigation, growth, and climate. In recent years, cotton production in Xiaomiao Township has consistently achieved large-scale yield increases with technological advancements, and has also created high-yield model examples. Seventy percent of the land in Xiaomiao Township is sandy soil. In 1953, the yield of ginned cotton was only twenty jin per mu. In 1955, the cultural and technical night school and demonstration fields were established to promote technological reforms, and the single-mu cotton yield in the township leaped by one and a half times. In 1956, it earned the title of "Hundred-Jin Cotton Township." In 1957, despite suffering a severe autumn drought that resulted in a 30% loss of cotton bolls, and the expansion of the township's area, it still achieved an excellent average yield of one hundred and ten jin of ginned cotton per mu. The cooperative members all believe that this is due to the "magic" of technology.

How was the cultural and technical night school in Xiaomiao Township established and developed? What experiences are worth learning from in various regions?

In May 1955, based on the strong desire of the majority of young people and poor peasants to escape cultural and technical backwardness, the Party branch instructed the Communist Youth League branch to establish a "Three-Personnel" (technician, accountant, farm tool operator) night school in Dengta Third Cooperative. At the same time, the young people of Dengta Second, Fourth, and Sixth Cooperatives also started their own, and even the Third Electoral District, which had no cooperative, "spontaneously" established one. The "Three-Personnel" night school was changed to the Youth Technical Night School.

Each night school cultivated a piece of experimental field (then called demonstration field). They learned techniques at night and put them into practice during the day. Everyone felt this method was very good. The young people who originally studied culture in the people's schools all rushed to the technical night school, and all twenty-nine people's schools collapsed. With the people's schools unable to operate, many agricultural cooperatives were worried about not being able to find accountants. The Party branch seized the masses' demands and decided to unify youth cultural learning and technical learning, changing it to the Youth Cultural and Technical Night School. At the same time, the Party branch decided to establish a Cultural and Technical Learning Guidance Group headed by the Deputy Secretary of the Party branch to unify leadership. In terms of teaching content, a set of cultural and technical textbooks was compiled.

Combining cultural learning with technical learning accelerated both the elimination of illiteracy and the popularization of technical knowledge. Zhang Yuexi, who was born as a child bride, didn't know a single word or understand production techniques in the past. After studying for half a year, she could recognize more than a thousand characters and became a technician in the township. She said, "When you do something, you recognize the characters related to it, and you remember them firmly. It's easier to understand technology with culture." The Youth Cultural and Technical Night School suddenly developed from six to sixty-six schools, and the number of students increased more than tenfold, with the demonstration fields also increasing twenty-fivefold. "Old Man Classes" and "Grandma Classes" appeared in the night school, along with moving examples of three generations of grandparents and grandchildren sitting in the same classroom. The Youth Cultural and Technical Night School had to remove the word "Youth" and was renamed the Cultural and Technical Night School.

"Do what you do, learn what you need, use what you learn, teach what you use," closely combining with production, serving production, and promoting production, implementing the principle of "learning for application," is a prominent experience of the Cultural and Technical Night School in Xiaomiao Township. In March 1956, because the wheat was growing too vigorously, cotton seedlings suffered from a linear growth phenomenon. The masses saw the cotton seedlings getting thinner day by day, couldn't find a good way to prevent it, and were worried about reduced production. At this critical moment, all the cultural and technical night schools in the township uniformly taught a technical lesson on "preventing linear growth in cotton seedlings." The next day, six hundred students mobilized to tie wheat bundles (a method to prevent linear growth in cotton seedlings) and passed the technique on to the masses, completing the task of tying wheat bundles throughout the township and stopping the linear growth. Students and people outside the school reflected that this lesson at the night school was equivalent to "planting" cotton.

"Every school runs a demonstration, every thing is a model," listening to lectures in the classroom at night, practicing in the fields during the day, learning and doing, doing and passing on, combining theory with practice, and combining the transmission of technology with the promotion of technology, combining "learning, seeing, doing." From the day it was established, the Cultural and Technical Night School in Xiaomiao Township has been combining demonstration fields to transmit and promote technology, and every school has several demonstration fields. These demonstration fields have three functions: first, to organize students to practice and master operational methods, so that theory guides practice, and practice consolidates and enriches theory. Second, to test new technologies and create new experiences. After learning the story of Michurin's breeding, the students of Dengta Fifth Cooperative cultivated a new variety named "Dengta Cotton." After representatives from the province, prefecture, and more than twenty counties visited and appraised it, they believed that this cotton variety had the advantages of being hairy, insect-resistant, suitable for close planting, fine fleece, long fleece, fertilizer-resistant, and drought-resistant. Third, to organize the masses to visit as an example, and comprehensively promote technology. According to the statistics of eighty-four demonstration fields, one hundred and thirty-two visits were organized throughout the year, educating ten thousand people and promoting more than ten kinds of technical experiences. The schools also adopted various forms that were welcomed by the masses in teaching, such as physical object teaching, "telling stories according to pictures," and the most widespread form was technological entertainment. For example, when selecting cotton seeds, the night school compiled the standards for seed selection into a rhyme: "Purple-red stalk, big peach, thin shell, crooked mouth, few pests, early bursting, choose it as the seed, excellent." The masses learned the technology of seed selection from singing. All year round, they make village painting boards, roadside hanging boards, and field insertion boards, giving people the opportunity to learn literacy and technology while walking. In this way, the Cultural and Technical Night School in Xiaomiao Township has persisted and consolidated, forming a mass movement of "every team runs a school, everyone learns culture, and everyone delves into technology."

Due to the great development of the night school and the large increase in the number of students, the question arose of who would serve as teachers. The contradiction also arose that the team leader had to hold meetings every night to arrange production and record work points, while the students had to study, which often caused disputes.

The Party branch adopted the method of "people teach people" and "learning while teaching," proposing that "team leaders run schools, civilian teachers teach, and cadres act as civilian teachers." That is, first, technical cadres teach township cadres, township cadres teach commune cadres, commune cadres teach night school students, layer by layer, one teaches ten, ten teach a hundred, and a hundred teach a thousand. The Party branch also stipulated in the system that the leadership from the township to the commune to the team should consistently "manage both" (production, school), "solve both" (teacher work loss subsidies and specific problems such as night school blackboards and lamp oil), "fix four" (teachers, students, leaders, study time), and "regularly do three" (arrange, check, and summarize). In implementing these resolutions and systems, Party Branch Secretary Cheng Chuanlin and District Committee Secretary Zou Zuyao both set an example, taking the lead in teaching, making examples, and creating experiences. Zou Zuyao, in the third team of Dengta Fifth Cooperative, worked in the fields with the cooperative members during the day and taught as a teacher in the evening, creating the method of "three minutes of work recording at the field head" and "arranging learning after work, and arranging production after school," completely solving the contradiction between learning and meetings. Then, Cheng Chuanlin created the experience of "turning the meeting place into a classroom" in the fourth team of Xingfu Cooperative. Just before sowing cotton seeds, Cheng Chuanlin gave a technical lesson on sowing to the students, transmitting technical specifications, proposing quality requirements, and arranging time tasks, which was both a class and an arrangement for production, solving the contradiction between leading production and leading learning.

Cadres act as both students and teachers, combining production and learning, leading production and leading learning, learning politics and learning culture and technology. In this way, not only was the contradiction that the people's schools were subject to the production season in the past, resulting in "enthusiasm in winter, relaxation in spring, little management in summer, and no questions in autumn" solved, so that the night school could persist in year-round learning and powerfully promote production, but at the same time, cultural technology was placed under the command of politics.

This year, Xiaomiao Township has established an intermediate-level amateur agricultural school on the basis of the cultural and technical night school; at the same time, it has further combined the cultural and technical night school with the mass "experimental fields," which has given the flower of the cultural and technical night school a solid foundation and made it bloom more luxuriantly. Three hundred and forty-eight cadres above the level of team leader and nearly a thousand cooperative members in the township have planted one thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven mu of experimental fields. The plans for these experimental fields include a yield of three thousand jin of seed cotton per mu, a yield of one thousand jin of ginned cotton per mu, and a goal to create "the best field in the world."

    使人人成为新式农民
    ——小庙乡的文化技术夜校介绍
    湖北日报记者　聂彬
    天门县小庙乡3年前文盲充斥，生产技术落后，要办农业社，全乡找不到一个会计；那时，人们不仅不相信先进的植棉技术，还把棉花的虫害也看成是“天火”。
    三年来，文化技术夜校彻底改变了小庙乡的这种落后状况，出现了一片新农村的新景象，这真是：
    文化技术开了花，棉花产量大高涨。
    劳动遍田野，歌舞满村庄；
    白天是庄稼汉，夜来进学堂；
    干劲加钻劲，跃进有保障。
    在今天的小庙乡，你要了解生产技术，纵横走遍全乡，从十多岁的少年到七十多岁的老人，都能谈出一大套；要看看文化活动，年青的姑娘们可随时把红绿绸带子往腰上一扎，唱起来跳起来；每天一到黄昏，男男女女，老老少少，祖孙三代，挟着书包含笑上学堂。
    文化技术夜校把全乡的劳动人民从文化技术上装备起来。当年，农业社找不到一个会计，现在，已经有四百四十九人都能担任会计，有的已经当了夜校教师；还有一千八百四十九人由纯文盲提高到半文盲，都会认会写一表（社员记工日记表）、二册（经济手册、劳动手册）、三票（粮、油、布票）、四便条（收、支、借、领条）。群众掌握了文化，生活的也更欢乐了。群众说，过去都是睁眼瞎，今天一眼看天下（读报）。全乡有一百一十四个读报组，常年读报。还有十五个俱乐部，二十八个创作组，四百一十八个演员，常年自编自演，自唱自乐。尤其在生产技术方面，棉花生长过程中的一套技术知识和操作方法，已为每个劳动者所掌握，而且还能讲科学道理。人们摸透了棉花施肥、虫害、排灌、生长以及气候等一套规律。几年来，小庙乡的棉花生产，一直是随着技术的跃进，年年获得大面积的增产，还创造了高额丰产典型。小庙乡有70％的土地是沙质，1953年才亩产皮棉二十斤，1955年创办文化技术夜校和示范田推行技术改革，全乡棉花单产跃进了一倍半；1956年获得了皮棉“百斤乡”的称号；1957年虽然遭受了严重的秋旱，棉桃损失30％，乡的范围又扩大了，然而仍然获得了平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤的优良成绩。社员们都认为这是技术“显灵”了。
    小庙乡的文化技术夜校是怎样创办和发展起来的呢？其中有那些经验值得各地学习呢？
    1955年5月，党支部根据当时广大青年和贫农对摆脱文化技术落后状况的强烈要求，责成团支部在灯塔三社创办一所“三员”（技术员、会计员、农具员）夜校。同时，灯塔二社、四社、六社的青年们也自己搞起来了，连没有合作社的第三选区也“自发”地办起了一所。并将“三员”夜校改成了青年技术夜校。
    每个夜校都搞了一块试验田（当时叫示范田），夜里学到技术，白天就实干，大家都觉得这办法很好。原来在民校学文化的青年纷纷往技术夜校跑，二十九班民校全部垮台。民校办不起来，许多农业社为找不到会计发愁。党支部抓住了群众的要求，决定把青年学文化和学技术统一起来，改为青年文化技术夜校。同时，党支部决定以党支部副书记为首成立文化技术学习指导小组，统一领导。在教学内容上，编了一套文化技术课本。
    学文化同学技术结合起来了，既加速了扫盲，又加速了技术知识的普及。过去一字不识、也不懂生产技术、童养媳出身的张月喜，学习半年，能认一千多字，还当上了乡里技术员，她说，“做什么事，认什么字，就认得牢固；有文化学技术容易懂。”青年文化技术夜校一下子由六所发展到六十六所，学员增加了十几倍，示范田也跟着翻了二十五翻。夜校里出现了“老头班”、“婆婆班”，祖孙三代同坐一课堂的动人事例。青年文化技术夜校不得不把“青年”二字去掉，改名为文化技术夜校。
    “做什么，学什么，用什么，教什么”，密切结合生产、服务生产、推动生产，贯彻“学以致用”的方针，这是小庙乡文化技术夜校突出的经验。1956年3月间，由于麦子生长太旺，棉花普遍发生了线苗现象，群众看着棉苗一天天瘦，找不到好的办法防止，耽心要减产。在这个重要环节上，全乡文化技术夜校，统一上了“防止棉花线苗”的技术课，第二天就有六百名学员出动扎麦把（防止棉花线苗的一种办法），并把技术传给了群众，完成了全乡扎麦把任务，制止了线苗。学员和校外群众反映，夜校上这课，等于“上”的棉花。
    “校校办示范，事事做样板”，夜晚课堂听课，白天田间实习，学了就做，做了就传，做到理论与实际结合，传授技术与推广技术结合，把“学、看、做”结合起来。小庙乡文化技术夜校从成立那天起就是结合示范田进行传授和推广技术的，校校都有几块示范田。这种示范田有三种作用：一是组织学员进行实习，掌握操作方法，让理论指导实践，让实践巩固、丰富理论。第二，试验新技术，创造新经验。灯塔五社学员学习了米丘林育种的故事后，培育了一种取名“灯塔棉”的良种。经省、专区和二十多县的代表参观鉴定，认为这号棉种有毛多、抗虫、宜于密植、绒细、绒长、耐肥、耐旱等好处。第三，做样子组织群众参观，全面推广技术。据八十四块示范田的统计，全年组织了一百三十二次参观，受到教育的人达一万人次，推广的技术经验达十多种。各校在教学上还采取了各种各样为群众喜闻乐见的形式，如实物教学，“照图说事”，最广泛的形式是技术娱乐化。如选棉种时，夜校把选种的标准编成顺口溜：“紫红杆，桃子大，壳子薄，歪嘴巴，害虫少，炸的早，选它做种呱呱叫。”群众从唱歌中学到了选种技术。常年四季做些村中画牌、路旁挂牌、田间插牌，让人们走路都有识字学技术的机会。这样，小庙乡的文化技术夜校就坚持和巩固起来了，形成了“队队办学校，人人学文化，个个钻技术”的群众运动。
    由于夜校的大发展，学员人数的大量增加，出现了谁来担任教师的问题；出现了队长每天晚上要开会布置生产和记工，学员要学习，经常发生争执的矛盾。
    党支部采取了“以民教民”“边教边学”的办法，提出“队长办学，民师教学，干部当民师”。即先由技术干部教会乡干部，乡干部教会社干部，社干部教会夜校学员，层层传授，一传十，十传百，百传千。党支部并从制度上规定，从乡到社到队的领导，要一贯到底地“两管”（生产、学校）、“两解决”（教师误工补助和夜校黑板、灯油等具体问题）、“四固定”（教员、学员、领导、学习时间）、“三经常”（布置、检查和总结）。在执行这些决议和制度中，党支部书记程传林和区委书记邹祖耀，都以身作则，带头教学，作出样子，创造经验。邹祖耀在灯塔五社三队，白天和社员一道下地生产，晚上当教师讲课，创造了“田头记工三分钟”和“放工布置学习，放学布置生产”的办法，完全解决了学习和会议的矛盾。接着，程传林又在幸福四社创造了“会场变课堂”的经验。正当播棉种之前，程传林向学员上了播种的技术课，传授了技术规格，提出了质量要求，布置了时间任务，既是上课，又是布置生产，解决了领导生产和领导学习的矛盾。
    干部既当学生，又当先生，把生产和学习、领导生产和领导学习、学政治和学文化技术结合在一起了。这样，不仅解决了以往办民校受生产季节支配出现的“冬起劲，春松劲，夏少管，秋不问”的矛盾，使夜校能坚持常年学习，有力推动生产，同时，把文化技术统帅于政治之下了。
    今年，小庙乡在文化技术夜校的基础上办起了中级业余农校；同时进一步使文化技术夜校和群众性的“试验田”结合起来，这就使文化技术夜校这朵花有了雄厚的基础，开得更茂盛。全乡三百四十八名队长以上的干部和近千名社员，种了一千九百六十七亩试验田。这些试验田的规划，有亩产籽棉三千斤的，有亩产皮棉一千斤的，有要创造“天下第一田”的。
