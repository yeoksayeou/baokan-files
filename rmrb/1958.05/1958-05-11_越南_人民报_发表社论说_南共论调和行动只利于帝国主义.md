Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 8th: The "People's Daily" today published an editorial entitled "Vigorously Strengthen the Unity of the International Communist Movement and the Workers' Movement," stating that the Vietnam Workers' Party cannot approve of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and once again declares its absolute loyalty to the Moscow Declaration.

The editorial pointed out that safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism is a task that the communist and workers' parties of all countries need to undertake in order to achieve the final victory of the communist ideal in their own countries and in the world. The unity of the proletariat is a necessary condition for the proletariat to achieve victory. The basis of this unity is the principles of Marxism-Leninism. At the time of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution last November, the communist and workers' parties of all countries held the Moscow Conference, which summarized the experience of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and issued two declarations of historical significance. True revolutionaries around the world regard these two declarations as their common program.

When the communist and workers' parties of the world completely agreed on the basis of the Moscow Declaration, the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia issued different voices. The position and viewpoint of the authors of the draft program of the South Communist Party have deviated from the position and viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism and are thoroughly the position and viewpoint of modern revisionism.

The editorial said that we believe that some of the arguments in the draft program of the South Communist Party have deviated from the revolutionary road and embarked on the road of "evolution." The draft program denies the necessity of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, confuses the essential difference between the world socialist camp and the capitalist camp, emphasizes "national characteristics," denies the universal laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, obliterates the interests of the international communist movement, and especially dilutes the interests of unity and cooperation among socialist brother countries in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

These arguments are contrary to the interests of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, which has been repeatedly confirmed by the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of socialist revolution. Especially at present, when international reactionary forces headed by American financial groups are actively encouraging revisionism and intensifying sabotage activities in many places, this kind of argument and action is particularly harmful to the proletariat and beneficial to international imperialism.

The editorial also refuted the claim in the draft program that Marxist ideas have fallen behind the development of modern society in recent decades. The editorial said, how can a true communist not understand that Marxism is inseparable from the developing reality? Marxism not only never lags behind real life at any time, but in this era, Marxism is precisely the torch that illuminates our path of life at all times. How can a loyal person who fights for the interests of his own country's proletariat and the world's proletariat not see the vigorous vitality of Marxist-Leninist thought embodied in the countless brilliant victories achieved in the Soviet Union, China, and various fraternal socialist countries, as well as the communist and workers' parties of the world?

The editorial then pointed out that the drafters of the draft program also attacked the only correct line of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, which has guided the revolutionary cause of the Soviet Union, China, the fraternal countries, and Vietnam to continuously move forward and achieve victory. This program issued many unfounded arguments such as so-called "ideological monopoly" and "political hegemony" against the consensus reached by the fraternal countries and fraternal parties. It can be seen that these arguments are completely distorting the facts and deliberately slandering and attacking the leading role of the Soviet Union.

The editorial said that since the proletarian revolutionary movement became an international movement, the proletariats of all countries have had a unified leading banner. In our era today, the Soviet Union is precisely the vanguard fighter holding high this banner. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the fraternal countries, and between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the fraternal parties, is a relationship of unity, mutual assistance, and close cooperation based on extremely close comradely feelings. The essence of the socialist system and ideals makes it impossible for this relationship to produce "ideological monopoly" or "political hegemony."

### 越南“人民报”发表社论说  南共论调和行动只利于帝国主义

　　越南“人民报”发表社论说
　　南共论调和行动只利于帝国主义
    新华社河内8日电　“人民报”今天以“大力加强国际共产主义运动和工人运动的统一性”为题发表社论说，越南劳动党不能赞成南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案，并且再一次宣布绝对忠诚于莫斯科会议宣言。
    社论指出，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性是各国共产党和工人党为了在自己国家和在世界上实现共产主义理想的最后胜利而需要担当起来的一项任务。无产阶级的统一是无产阶级取得胜利的必要条件。这种统一的基础就是马克思列宁主义的原则。在去年11月纪念十月革命四十周年的时候，各国共产党和工人党举行了莫斯科会议，曾经总结了国际共产主义运动和工人运动的经验，并且发表了两个具有历史意义的宣言。世界上真正的革命者都把这两个宣言当作自己的共同纲领。
    当世界各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科宣言的基础上完全取得一致的时候，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会却发出了不同的声调。南共的纲领草案的作者的立场和观点已经脱离了马克思列宁主义的立场和观点，是彻头彻尾的现代修正主义的立场和观点。
    社论说，我们认为南共纲领草案的一些论点离开了革命的道路而走上“进化”的道路。纲领草案否认在从资本主义过渡到社会主义时期中的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的必要性，混淆了世界社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营的本质区别，强调“民族特点”，否认社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的普遍规律，抹煞国际共产主义运动的利益，尤其是冲淡了社会主义各兄弟国家之间按无产阶级国际主义精神团结一致的利益。
    这些论点是违背国际共产主义运动和工人运动的利益的，这一点已经屡次为马克思列宁主义的理论和社会主义革命的实践所证实。尤其是在目前，当以美国财阀为首的国际反动势力正在积极地为修正主义打气，并且在许多地方加紧进行破坏活动的时候，这种论调和行动特别有害于无产阶级而有利于国际帝国主义。
    社论还驳斥了纲领草案提出的关于近几十年来马克思主义思想已经落后于现代社会发展的说法。社论说，一个真正的共产主义者，怎么会不懂得马克思主义同正在发展着的现实生活是密不可分的呢？马克思主义不仅在任何时候都不会落在现实生活的后面，而且在这个时代里，马克思主义正是时刻照耀着我们的生活道路的火炬。一个忠诚的、为自己本国无产阶级和世界无产阶级的利益而战斗的人，又怎么能看不见在苏联、中国和各个兄弟的社会主义国家以及世界各国共产党和工人党所取得的无数的辉煌胜利里面，所体现出来的马克思列宁主义思想的旺盛的生命力呢？
    社论接着指出，纲领草案的起草人还攻击国际共产主义运动和工人运动的唯一正确的路线，这个路线曾经引导苏联、中国、各兄弟国家和越南的革命事业不断地向前发展和取得胜利。这个纲领针对各兄弟国家和各兄弟党所达成的一致看法，发出了许多毫无根据的所谓“思想垄断”、“政治霸权”等论调。可以看出，这些论调是完全歪曲事实、故意诽谤和攻击苏联的领导作用。
    社论说，自从无产阶级革命运动成为一个国际运动以来，各国无产阶级就已经有了一面统一领导的旗帜。在我们今天的这个时代里，苏联正是高举着这面旗帜的先锋战士。苏联同各兄弟国家之间、苏联共产党同各兄弟党之间的关系，是建立在无比亲密的同志感情的基础上的一种团结互助和紧密无间的关系。社会主义制度和理想的本质，使得这种关系从未产生、也不可能产生“思想垄断”或“政治霸权”。
