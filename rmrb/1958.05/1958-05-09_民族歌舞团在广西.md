After participating in the performance for the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe was divided into two sub-groups in mid-March, going deep into mountainous areas, rural villages, construction sites, factories and mines, towns, and army companies, touring and performing over 400 shows. The second sub-group, while in the Baise area, climbed over mountains and ridges to the hometown of martyr Wei Baqun, to give comfort performances to the people of the old revolutionary base and the workers at the reservoir construction site.

During the intense performance activities, the members of the song and dance troupe showed a high degree of political enthusiasm for serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The most popular Uyghur dancer, Mina, once performed continuously 56 times in a day, and the audience praised her as "a person who knows no fatigue."

    民族歌舞团在广西
    中央民族歌舞团在参加了广西僮族自治区成立大会演出后，在3月中旬分成两个分团，分别深入山区、农村、工地、厂矿、市镇、连队，巡回演出四百多场。第二分团在百色专区时，曾经爬山越岭到韦拔群烈士的故乡，为革命老根据地人民和水库工地民工们进行慰问演出。
    在紧张的演出活动中，歌舞团团员们表现了高度的为工农兵服务的政治热情。最受群众欢迎的维吾尔族舞蹈家米娜娃曾经一天连续演出五十六次，观众称赞她是“不知疲劳的人”。
