    Semiconductor Computer Can Solve Mathematical Equations

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: According to the fourth issue of the Soviet magazine "Young Technician," the Soviet Institute of Computer Manufacturing Science has recently created the world's first semiconductor "MH-10" type mathematical simulator.

　　This new type of computer, capable of solving advanced mathematical equations, is made entirely of semiconductors and contains no vacuum tubes. It weighs only 45 kilograms, and its area has been reduced to about half the size of a writing desk.

　　The new mathematical simulator can calculate various problems at extremely high speeds. For example, to calculate the flight trajectory of an aircraft in 100 seconds, it would take a human calculator almost a month to complete, but with this computer, the answer can be obtained in just a few hours.

    Plastic Car - Lightweight and Flexible

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: Staff at the Bauman Higher Technical School in Moscow have trial-produced a car with a body made entirely of plastic.

　　This body is not only as strong as a metal body, but also superior to a metal body in many ways. For example, the total weight of this plastic body is 47 kilograms, while a metal body of the same size weighs 140 to 150 kilograms. Therefore, the use of a plastic body not only makes the car lighter and more flexible, but also reduces gasoline consumption. The new body is more durable than metal because it is corrosion-resistant, and its heat and sound insulation performance is also much better than metal.

    半导体计算机能解数学方程式
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　据苏联“少年技术家”杂志第四期报道，苏联计算机制造科学研究所最近制成了世界上第一架半导体的“MH——一○”型数学模拟机。
    这种能够解高等数学方程式的新型计算机，是用半导体制成的，没有一个电子管。它只有四十五公斤重，面积也缩小到像写字台半个桌面那样大。
    新型的数学模拟机能够以极高速度演算各种算题。例如要计算出一架飞机在一百秒钟内的一种航行轨迹，一个计算员差不多要花一个月时间才能算完，而用这种计算机，只消几个钟头便能得出答案。
    塑料汽车　轻便灵活
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　莫斯科鲍曼高等技术学院的工作人员试制成了一辆全部车身用塑料制成的汽车。
    这种车身不仅坚固程度不下于金属车身，而且在许多方面还优于金属车身。例如，这种塑料车身的重量总共是四十七公斤，而同样大小的金属车身重量却要达到一百四十到一百五十公斤。因此，使用塑料车身，不仅汽车更加轻便灵活，而且汽油消耗量也降低许多。新车身由于不怕腐蚀，比金属制的更加经久耐用，隔热、隔音性能也比金属好得多。
