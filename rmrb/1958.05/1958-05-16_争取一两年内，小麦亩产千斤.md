Strive for a Thousand Jin per Mu of Wheat Within One or Two Years
Shen Hanmin, First Secretary of the CPC Gucheng County Committee, Hubei Province

　　Old Man Shi is Convinced
　　The old man is over sixty, has seen two or three emperors pass,
　　Seen quite a bit of the world, but never seen wheat like this.
　　Years of old habits, broken all at once this year.
　　In the past, plows barely scratched three inches of soil, this year they plowed more than eight.
　　In the past, every mu was broadcast sown, this year every mu is strip-sown.
　　In the past, there was little fertilizer in the fields, this year more than two hundred (dan) per mu.
　　Wheat ears are long and grains are full, each mu can yield more than a thousand (jin).
　　This is thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party, this is thanks to the many methods of the cooperative…
　　This doggerel was written by Shi Xingchang, an old member of the Dongsheng Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei.

　　Shi Xingchang is an experienced old farmer. Everything is fine with him, except he has a head full of conservative ideas. When the cooperative asked for a thousand jin per mu of wheat this year, he said: "Get a thousand jin?! I think you are like the egret shedding tears, dreaming of fish (being foolish)!" From the beginning of winter sowing last year, he has been strongly opposed to all new production increase measures, until recently, when he saw the wheat yielding a thousand jin per mu right before his eyes, he wrote this doggerel.

　　The Dongsheng Cooperative has a large population and little land, but the soil is good and the work foundation is also good. The director of the cooperative and the secretary of the Party branch is Rao Yunfu, a national model agricultural laborer. This year, the cooperative has 2,149 mu of wheat. After multiple inspections and appraisals by agricultural technicians, it was determined that each mu of wheat land has an average of more than 400,000 ears, and each ear has an average of 35 grains. It is estimated that each mu can yield about a thousand jin of wheat. Among them, 26 mu of wheat land have more than 800,000 ears per mu, with the potential to yield double the thousand jin per mu.

　　According to the recent inspections and mass appraisals by the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee, and the County Party Committee: the 446 cooperatives in the county have 260,000 mu of wheat land, each mu has an average of about 300,000 ears, each ear has an average of about 30 grains of wheat. Calculating 15,000 grains of wheat per jin, the average yield per mu of wheat in the county can reach 500 to 600 jin. The county will have more than 40 "thousand-jin wheat cooperatives", 50,000 to 70,000 mu of thousand-jin mu, and more than 200 mu of double-thousand-jin mu.

　　The Key to Doubling Production

　　Looking at the growth of wheat yield per mu in the county, it was less than 100 jin before liberation. After liberation, it was 108 jin in 1949. In 1955, after the realization of cooperativization, it reached 162 jin, 252 jin in 1956, and 274 jin in 1957. This year, the total output of wheat can be doubled compared to last year. Even calculating the yield per mu at only 500 jin, it is still a great leap forward compared to last year. Why was there no great leap forward in the past few years, and only this year did we have a great leap forward? The key to determining the great leap forward in production lies in the great ideological liberation and great transformation of work style of the entire Party.

　　The terrain of the county is different, with high mountains, hills, and plains, and the soil quality is good and bad. More than 110,000 mu of land has poor soil quality. Farmers describe this poor land as: "A knife in sunny weather, a mess in rainy weather." In 1957, the high yield record of good land reached 1,400 jin per mu, while the lowest yield per mu of bad land was less than 60 jin. There were only more than 40 advanced cooperatives and more than 30 backward cooperatives in the county. How to let the backward cooperatives catch up with the advanced cooperatives, how to turn land with poor soil quality into land with good soil quality, how to turn key experiences into universal experiences, that is, how to achieve a combination of points and areas, and strive for balanced production increases over a large area, this has been a knot in the ideology of our county party committee for several years.

　　In 1957, agricultural production in the county achieved a bumper harvest. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, under the influence of the upsurge of the socialist revolution throughout the province and the country, the entire county's rural areas carried out a mass rectification movement through extensive airing of views, debates, and big-character posters. The ideology of cadres throughout the county was greatly liberated, the work style was greatly transformed, they took the lead in everything, and engaged in experimental fields. They constantly organized visits, comparisons, and debates, boosted their energy, and strived to go upstream. The general principle and general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results became the actual actions of the Party organizations and agricultural cooperatives in the county. The entire county launched a production campaign centered on water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement on an unprecedented scale, and launched a production campaign of unprecedented scale in agricultural tool reform and technological innovation. A socialist competition heatwave of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced was stirred up among townships, cooperatives, teams, and people.

　　Under such circumstances, the advanced and backward quickly transformed each other. Some branch secretaries said, "In this day and age, being a little careless will make you fall behind." The vast majority of people were unwilling to lag behind and were striving to go upstream, comparing, catching up, and working hard. Take a township as an example, cooperatives were competing with each other, catching up with each other, and encouraging each other to work hard.

　　Hugang Township is like that. The cooperatives in this township launched a "compare," "catch up," and "work hard" competition. The 7-1 Cooperative caught up with the Sanhe Cooperative, the Sanhe Cooperative caught up with the Gongtong Cooperative, the Gongtong Cooperative caught up with the Dongsheng Cooperative, and the Dongsheng Cooperative caught up with the 8-1 Cooperative. In such competitions, people showed unprecedented courage and a sweeping style.

　　Here, let me tell the story of the Sanhe Cooperative catching up with the Gongtong Cooperative.

　　In Hugang Township, many people would not believe that the Sanhe Cooperative could catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative. Because the work foundation of the Sanhe Cooperative was relatively poor, the soil was not good, and the yield has always been very low, especially some ridge land, which once had the joke of "one hundred mu of one jin of cotton" (that is, only one jin of cotton was harvested per mu of land). And the Gongtong Cooperative? The work foundation was relatively good, the soil was also relatively good, and it has always been one of the high-yield cooperatives in the county. At the winter sowing conference held in the county last July, Zhu Guoyun, the 22-year-old director of the Sanhe Cooperative and secretary of the Party branch, challenged the Gongtong Cooperative at the meeting. The director of the Gongtong Cooperative smiled and said, "Wait two years before catching up!" Zhu Guoyun said, "We will catch up with you in 1958!" Since then, the two cooperatives have been "comparing" with each other.

　　The Art of Persuasion

　　After returning to the cooperative from the county, Zhu Guoyun found more than 50 key members overnight to discuss how to catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative. The meeting was a clamorous affair. Some said it would work, some said it wouldn't. Old technician Chen Daoyin has always been an "opponent" of Zhu Guoyun. He opposed whatever Zhu Guoyun advocated. He was an "old hand" at production, and relying on his own experience, he disdained Zhu Guoyun. He often said to Zhu Guoyun: "Gold is still gold, silver is still silver, boy is still boy, girl is still girl!" Zhu Guoyun also had a set of methods for him. If you don't understand, I will persuade you. If you still don't understand, I will do it for you to see. If you still don't understand, I will let everyone debate, and when everyone understands, I will persuade you again. From the time of running the advanced cooperative in 1955, she used this set of methods to fight with her "opponents." The result of each struggle was like this: Chen Daoyin shook his head in the face of living facts, sighed, conceded defeat in his heart, but did not accept it in his mouth. When Zhu Guoyun proposed a new measure, he repeated his maxims: "Gold is still gold, silver is still silver...." That night, when he heard Zhu Guoyun say that she would catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative in 1958, he was annoyed. He said: "Director, you are talking in your sleep! What kind of land is the Gongtong Cooperative's land? You can step on it and oil comes out! What kind of land is our cooperative's land? You shit and no maggots grow!..." After he said this, about half of the people at the meeting did not agree to catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative. Zhu Guoyun said: "Our cooperative also has high-yield typical examples!" She cited the example of the fourth team harvesting 300 jin of wheat from three fen of land. Many people still did not understand, because that three fen of land was good land! Zhu Guoyun said: "Our cooperative also has typical examples of bumper harvests on bad land!" She cited the example of the first team having ten mu of land, which was the worst land in the entire cooperative, and last year the average yield per mu was 370 jin of wheat. Many people's thinking was clear. After three days of debate, everyone understood except Chen Daoyin. Then, a great debate to catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative was launched in the entire cooperative. The central topic of the debate was: Can bad land produce high yields? How can we achieve high yields? After two months of debate, the confidence of the members was sufficient, the enthusiasm was great, and a heatwave of catching up with the Gongtong Cooperative was set off throughout the cooperative. Zhu Guoyun herself also expressed her greatest determination to the members: "I will not get married until I catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative!"

　　In the process of "catching up," there were many difficulties.

　　To change from broadcasting to strip sowing, we encountered a drought. Many people began to waver. Chen Daoyin said to Zhu Guoyun: "Broadcast it! ...We won't catch up this year, let's talk about it next year!" Zhu Guoyun insisted on drought-resistant strip sowing. Chen Daoyin said: "Bad land can only be broadcasted, but you insist on strip sowing. Why don't you 'adapt to local conditions'? You don't accept the opinions I put forward, why don't you 'transform your work style'?" You see, "adapting to local conditions" and "transforming work style," these kinds of good words, here, have become the "weapons" for the "conservatives" to attack the "revolutionaries."

　　Experimental Fields - A Powerful Weapon Against Conservatism

　　The most powerful weapon for Zhu Guoyun and her comrades to counter the conservatives was to run experimental fields. She and the Youth League Secretary Pi Guozhang led the youth shock team to carry out wheat high-yield experiments on the famous bad land of "one hundred mu of one jin of cotton." She and other farmers also conducted experiments on wheat yield of one thousand jin per mu on land with better soil quality. In a series of production processes such as deep plowing, applying base fertilizer in layers, wide-strip dense planting, topdressing, transplanting seedlings to replenish missing seedlings, drought-resistant seedling protection, and pest control, obstacles of conservative thinking represented by Chen Daoyin were encountered at every link. However, the innovators represented by Zhu Guoyun not only did not relax any production link because of this, but also grasped every production link more tightly. Make a model in the experimental field, ask everyone to come and see, compare, criticize, and debate. Letting the experimental field speak, letting everyone speak, is ten thousand times better than the cadres themselves talking a lot. I will only give one example:

　　Near the Lunar New Year, the wheat seedlings in the cooperative turned yellow, including the experimental fields. Chen Daoyin and Zhu Guoyun sang a counter-drama. He also ran an experimental field. He was against dense planting and insisted on sparse planting. At this time, he saw this trend and came with "energy" again. He sang a playful doggerel:

　　"Don't be afraid of your density,
　　Don't look at my sparsity,
　　Sparse wheat will still sit at the head of the table..."

　　Obviously, Chen Daoyin attributed the yellowing of wheat seedlings to "dense planting." Zhu Guoyun calmed down and inquired at the Gongtong Cooperative, where they were launching topdressing and drought resistance. She determined that the yellowing of wheat seedlings was due to lack of fertilizer and drought. She first topdressed and watered the experimental field, and the wheat seedlings turned green. She mobilized everyone to do the same. However, many people represented by Chen Daoyin did not agree. The reasons were that there was no fertilizer for topdressing, and there was no habit of watering wheat fields for drought resistance. Besides, after working hard for a winter, wouldn't you let us rest during the New Year?

　　Under such circumstances, Zhu Guoyun launched another debate. The Gongtong Cooperative is topdressing and drought resisting. We want to catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative, what should we do? The result of the debate was that we must catch up with the Gongtong Cooperative, we must topdress, and we must resist drought. If there is no fertilizer, tear down the earthen walls of the old houses! To resist drought, we must resist drought while celebrating the New Year. Zhu Guoyun and her comrades took the lead.

　　"Taking the lead," this is the first step in following the mass line. If you can't take this first step, you can't talk about following the mass line. Running experimental fields is taking the lead. Setting an example and being in the forefront is taking the lead. No matter what you do, as long as the Communist Party members take the lead, everything can be done well! Let's talk about tearing down the earthen walls of old houses to make fertilizer. This is not a simple matter. At this time, it was very cold and the New Year was approaching. No one was willing to tear down the earthen walls of their own houses. What to do? Pi Guozhang persuaded a family to tear down the earthen walls of their own house, and led the members to do so automatically. The entire cooperative tore down the earthen walls of 162 old houses and topdressed more than 700 mu of wheat land twice. In terms of the quantity and quality of topdressing, it exceeded the Gongtong Cooperative.

　　Then, there was drought-resistant seedling protection. Zhu Guoyun launched another debate: How to celebrate the New Year? Just eating, drinking, and celebrating the New Year, or resisting drought while celebrating the New Year? The result of the debate was unanimous that we should resist drought while celebrating the New Year. On the first day of the New Year, Zhu Guoyun wore a floral dress and led all the women in the cooperative, all wearing floral dresses, to celebrate the New Year while pumping water. Celebrating the New Year in this way was also full of happiness, and the wheat seedlings that suffered from drought also drank their fill of water. In terms of drought resistance, they also caught up with the Gongtong Cooperative.

　　The situation changed. The site of the township's on-site meeting was transferred from the Gongtong Cooperative to the Sanhe Cooperative. The people of the Gongtong Cooperative panicked. The captain of the eighth team shouted: "It's terrible, the sky has turned over, the wheat seedlings of the Sanhe Cooperative are growing better than ours, we must work harder!" Under such stimulation, the Gongtong Cooperative worked hard.

　　The Backward Catches Up with the Advanced

　　Who exactly surpassed whom between these two cooperatives? According to the results of the county party committee's inspection, it should be said that the Sanhe Cooperative has basically caught up with the Gongtong Cooperative. Its total wheat output is more than the Gongtong Cooperative, and the yield per mu is only a hundred or so jin less. Last year, the wheat yield per mu of the Sanhe Cooperative was 268 jin, and this year it may reach more than 750 jin, and there are also more than 100 mu of "thousand-jin mu." What is particularly noteworthy is that the famous ridge land of "one hundred mu of one jin of cotton" can also harvest 800 jin of wheat per mu! Zhu Guoyun seized this typical example and mobilized all the members to strive to become a thousand-jin wheat cooperative next year. Chen Daoyin stood in front of this wheat field and looked at it again and again. The wheat seedlings were old and tall, the ears were old, many, and big, and the grains were round and full. He had nothing to say, but said one sentence: "I really didn't expect that this bad land could grow such good wheat!"

　　Of course, there are many more things that Chen Daoyin "didn't expect." Not to mention that there are high-yield typical examples in plains and ridge land, there are also high-yield typical examples in mountain land. The seventh team of the Millionaire Cooperative alone has 16 mu of thousand-jin mu!

　　The fact that there are thousand-jin mu in mountain land, ridge land, and plains tells us that all parts of the county have the possibility and should reach the level of a thousand jin per mu of wheat. The Sanhe Cooperative with poor soil quality may become a thousand-jin wheat cooperative next year. Why can't the entire county become a thousand-jin wheat county in one or two years? This year, there are more than 200 mu of double-thousand-jin mu. Why can't there be a larger area of double-thousand-jin next year?

　　Unlimited Prospects for Agricultural Production

　　During this major inspection, we discovered a very mind-opening thing, that is: double-thousand-jin mu also has many shortcomings, for example, the plowing is not deep enough, the seeds are not pure enough, the fertilizer is not evenly applied, the density is not uniform enough, and pests and diseases have not been eradicated, etc. Looking at the ears, the large ones have a hundred grains of wheat, the small ones only have twenty or so grains, and some good wheat also has the phenomenon of lodging. Double-thousand-jin mu also has shortcomings, that is to say, there are still loopholes and potential. Not to mention those below double-thousand-jin. In the past, we had never seen "double-thousand-jin," and we not only didn't dare to conduct experiments on double-thousand-jin, but we didn't even dare to think about it. Now, having seen "double-thousand-jin" with our own eyes has further liberated our thinking. If, by next year, we overcome these shortcomings of the existing double-thousand-jin mu, then how much can the wheat yield per mu be increased? With the improvement of basic conditions such as water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, and seeds, with the development of agricultural science and technology, and with the improvement of the production technology level of agricultural cooperatives, how much wheat can be harvested from one mu of land in the future? In our county, one piece of land not only harvests wheat, but also harvests cotton. Last year, there was already a bumper harvest typical example of double-thousand-jin cotton and wheat. This year, we may see a larger area of double-thousand-jin cotton and wheat. In another two or three years, can our county become a county of double-thousand-jin cotton and wheat?

　　All these questions must be given affirmative answers in our future agricultural production practice. We have the possibility and should provide better answers to these questions. We believe that the leading force of the Party is endless, the collective wisdom and collective strength of the people are endless, and the superiority of the socialist-communist system is endless, therefore, the prospects for agricultural production development are also limitless.

　　After discussions by the Party organizations and agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, we are determined and confident to increase the wheat yield per mu in the county to 1,000 jin within one or two years, and at the same time, strive to have a larger area of double-thousand-jin per mu of wheat and double-thousand-jin of cotton and wheat, so that wheat, a low-yield crop, will become a high-yield crop, and fundamentally remove the hat of low yield from our county. Whether or not this goal can be achieved, the key issue lies in leadership. It lies in the combination of leadership and the masses, better implementing the general principle and general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, launching a more in-depth and more extensive mass movement of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced throughout the county, and setting off a mass technical revolution and cultural revolution on the basis of the upsurge of mass rectification, to further promote a great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　争取一两年内，小麦亩产千斤
　　中共湖北省谷城县委第一书记　沈汉民
    石老汉心服了
    老汉今年六十多，皇帝过了两三个，
    见的世面也不少，这号麦子未见过。
    多少年的老规矩，今年一下被打破。
    往年犁无三寸土，今年犁了八寸多。
    往年亩亩是撒播，今年亩亩改条播。
    往年地里没啥肥，今年每亩两百多（担）。
    麦穗长来麦粒饱，每亩能收一千多（斤）。
    这是共产党的领导好，这是合作社的办法多。……
    这首顺口溜，是湖北谷城县东升社的一个老社员石兴昌作的。
    石兴昌是一位有经验的老农。什么事都好，就是满脑袋的保守思想。当社里要求今年全社小麦亩产千斤的时候，他说：“搞千斤！？我看你们是白鹤子流泪，想鱼（愚）了！”从去年冬播开始，他对于一切新的增产措施，都极力反对，直到最近，眼看亩产千斤的麦子到了手，他才做了这首顺口溜。
    东升社，人多地少，土质好，工作基础也好。社主任、党支部书记是全国农业劳动模范饶运富。这个社今年的小麦有二千一百四十九亩，经过农业技术人员多次检查鉴定，全社每亩麦地平均有四十多万穗子，每个穗子平均有三十五粒，预计每亩可以收到千把斤麦子。其中二十六亩麦地，每亩的穗子在八十万以上，大有亩产双千斤的可能。
    据最近省委、地委、县委的检查和群众性的评比鉴定结果：全县四百四十六个合作社二十六万亩麦地，每亩平均有三十万个左右的穗子，每个穗子平均有三十粒左右的麦子，以一万五千粒麦子为一斤计算，全县小麦的亩产量可以达到五百到六百斤。全县将有四十多个“小麦千斤社”，有五万亩到七万亩千斤亩，有两百多亩双千斤亩。
    产量翻一番的关键
    从全县小麦单产增长情况来看，解放以前，不到一百斤。解放以后，1949年是一百零八斤，1955年实现了合作化，达到了一百六十二斤，1956年是二百五十二斤，1957年是二百七十四斤。今年小麦的总产量可以比去年翻一番。单产，只照五百斤算账，也比去年有了很大的跃进。为什么过去几年没有大跃进，直到今年才大跃进？决定生产大跃进的关键，在于全党的思想大解放，作风大转变。
    全县的地势不同，有高山，有丘陵，有平原，土质有好有坏。土质坏的地有十一万多亩。农民形容这种坏地是：“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”。1957年，好地的高额丰产纪录，达到亩产一千四百斤，坏地的最低亩产量还不到六十斤。全县的先进社只有四十多个，落后社有三十多个，如何让落后社赶上先进社，如何让土质坏的地变成土质好的地，如何让重点的经验变成普遍的经验，也就是说，如何实现点面结合，争取大面积的平衡增产，这是几年来，在我们县委思想上一直没有解开的一个疙瘩。
    1957年，全县的农业生产得到了丰收。在上级党委的领导下，在全省、全国的社会主义革命高潮的影响下，全县农村经过大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报，开展了全民整风运动。全县干部思想大解放，作风大转变，遇事带头干，都搞试验田，不断的组织参观评比和辩论，鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针，总路线，变成了全县党组织和农业合作社的实际行动。全县开展了空前规模的兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤为中心的生产运动，开展了空前规模的农具改革和技术革新运动。在乡、社、队和人与人之间，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛的热潮。
    在这样的形势下，先进和落后迅速地互相转化，有的支部书记说，“这年头，稍为马虎一点就落后了”。绝大多数的人都不愿自甘落后，都在力争上游，都在比、在赶、在干。就一个乡来说，社与社之间也在互相比，互相赶，互相鼓干劲。
    胡岗乡就是这样。这个乡的合作社，开展“比”、“赶”、“干”的竞赛。七一社赶三合社，三合社赶共同社，共同社赶东升社，东升社赶八一社。人们在这样的竞赛中，表现了前无古人的气概和势如破竹的风格。
    在这里，说一说三合社赶共同社的故事吧。
    在胡岗乡，要说三合社能赶上共同社，许多人是不会相信的。因为三合社的工作基础比较差，土质不好，向来的产量很低，尤其是有一部分岗地，曾经有过“百亩百斤棉”（即每亩地只收了一斤棉花）的笑话。而共同社呢？工作基础比较好，土质也比较好，向来是全县的高产社之一。去年7月，在县里召开的冬播会议上，三合社的主任、党支部书记、二十二岁的姑娘朱国蕴，在会上提出了赶共同社的挑战。共同社的主任笑了笑说：“等二年再赶吧！”朱国蕴说：“就在1958年要赶上你们！”从此以后，这两个社就“比”起来了。
    说服的艺术
    朱国蕴从县里回到社里，连夜找了五十多个骨干分子来商量如何赶共同社的问题。会上七嘴八舌，吵了一通。有的说行，有的说不行。老技术员陈道银，一向是朱国蕴的一个“对立面”。朱国蕴提倡什么，他就反对什么。他是个生产的“老把式”，凭着自己有经验，一个劲儿瞧不起朱国蕴。他常常冲着朱国蕴说：“金子还是金子，银子还是银子，儿娃子（即男孩）还是儿娃子，?子（即女孩）还是?子！”朱国蕴对他也有一套办法，你不通，我说服你，你还不通，我做给你看，你老是不通，我让大家辩论，等大家都通了，再说服你。从1955年办高级社的时候，她就是使着这套办法和她的“对立面”进行斗争。每一次斗争的结果都是这样，陈道银在活生生的事实面前，摇摇头，叹口气，心里认输，口里不服。一到朱国蕴提出新的措施的时候，他又重复他那几句格言：“金子还是金子，银子还是银子……。”这一天夜晚，他听到朱国蕴说要在1958年赶上共同社，他可恼了。他说：“主任，你是在说梦话！人家共同社的地是什么地？一脚踩的出油来！我们社的地是什么地？屙屎不生蛆！……”。经他这一说，会场大约有一半人不赞成赶共同社。朱国蕴说：“我们社里也有高产典型哪！”她举出了四队有三分地收了三百斤小麦的例子。许多人还是搞不通，因为那三分地是好地呀！朱国蕴说：“我们社里也有坏地能丰收的典型哪！”她举出了一队有十亩地，是全社最坏的地，去年每亩平均收了三百七十斤麦子的例子，许多人的思想通了。经过三天的辩论，除了陈道银以外，都通了。接着，在全社发动了一场赶共同社的大辩论。辩论的中心题目是：坏地能不能高产？如何才能高产？辩论了两个月，社员的信心足了，干劲大了，全社掀起了一个赶共同社的热潮。朱国蕴本人也向社员们表示了最大的决心：“不赶上共同社，不结婚！”
    在“赶”的当中，碰到了重重的困难。
    要改撒播为条播，偏偏碰上了天旱。许多人动摇起来了。陈道银对朱国蕴说：“撒播了吧！……今年赶不上了，明年再说吧！”朱国蕴坚持要抗旱条播。陈道银说：“坏地只能撒播，你偏要条播，你为什么不‘因地制宜’？我提的意见，你不接受，你为什么不‘转变作风’？”你看，“因地制宜”、“转变作风”这类好话，在这里，却成为“保守派”攻击“革命派”的“武器”了。
    试验田——反保守的有力武器
    朱国蕴和她的战友们反击保守派最有力的武器是搞试验田。她和团支书皮国章带领青年突击队在那块有名的“百亩百斤棉”的坏地上进行小麦高产的试验。她又和其他农民在土质较好的地上进行小麦亩产千斤的试验。在深耕、分层施底肥、宽幅条播密植、追肥、移苗补苗、抗旱保苗、治虫等一系列的生产过程中，每一个环节上都要遇到以陈道银为代表的保守思想的障碍。然而，以朱国蕴为代表的革新派，不仅没有因此而放松任何一个生产环节，而且更加紧地抓住了每一个生产环节。在试验田做出样子，请大家来看，来比，来批评，来辩论。叫试验田说话，叫大伙儿说话，比光是干部自己哇啦哇啦地讲一大套要强过一万倍。这里只举一个例子：
    快到旧历年的时候，社里的麦苗发了黄，连试验田也不例外。陈道银和朱国蕴唱对台戏，他也搞了一块试验田，他是反对密植，坚持稀植的。这时，他一看这种势头，又来“劲儿”了。他唱着一首俏皮的顺口溜：
    “不怕你的密，
    莫看我的稀，
    稀麦还要坐上席，……”
    很显然，陈道银把麦苗发黄归咎于“密植”。朱国蕴沉住气，到共同社打听，那里正在发动追肥和抗旱。她断定麦苗发黄是由于缺肥和受旱，她首先在试验田里追了肥，浇了水，麦苗转青了，她动员大伙也这样做。可是，以陈道银为代表的许多人不同意，理由是，追肥，没有肥；抗旱，哪有麦地浇水的习惯；再说，忙了一个冬，临过年，还不叫休息休息？
    在这样的情况下，朱国蕴又发动了一场辩论。共同社在追肥，在抗旱，我们要赶共同社，该怎么办？辩论的结果是，一定要赶上共同社，一定要追肥，要抗旱。没有肥料，把旧房子的土墙拆掉！要抗旱，就得边过年，边抗旱。朱国蕴和她的战友们带头干起来了。
      “带头干”，这是走群众路线的第一步。迈不开这第一步，就谈不上走群众路线。搞试验田是带头干，以身作则，身先士卒，是带头干，无论干什么，只要共产党员带头干，一切事情都能干的好！就说拆旧房子的土墙作肥料吧，这不是一个简单的事情。这时候，天很冷，又快过年，拆谁家的土墙谁也不乐意。怎么办，皮国章说服了一家人，拆掉了自家的土墙，带动了社员们也自动地这样做，全社拆了一百六十二间旧房子的土墙，给七百多亩麦地追了两次肥。在追肥的数量和质量上，都超过了共同社。
    接着，就是抗旱保苗。朱国蕴又发动了一场辩论：怎么过年？光是吃喝过年，还是边抗旱边过年？辩论的结果，一致认为应当边抗旱边过年。年初一，朱国蕴穿着花衣服，领着全社的妇女都穿着花衣服，边车水，边过年，这样过年，人也满快活，受了干的麦苗也饱饱地喝了一顿水。在抗旱这方面，也赶上了共同社。
    情况变了。乡的现场会议的地点从共同社转移到三合社来了。共同社的人着了慌，八队队长大喊大叫：“不得了，天翻过来了，三合社的麦苗长的比我们好，我们要加劲儿呀！”共同社在这样的刺激之下，大干起来了。
    落后的赶上了先进的
    这两个社究竟是谁赛过谁？照县委检查的结果，应当说，三合社已经基本上赶上了共同社。它的小麦的总产量比共同社多，单产也只差百把斤。三合社的小麦单产，去年是二百六十八斤，今年可能达到七百五十斤以上，而且还出现了一百多亩的“千斤亩”。特别令人注意的是那块有名的“百亩百斤棉”的岗地，每亩也能收八百斤麦子！朱国蕴抓住了这个典型，动员全体社员努力争取明年成为小麦千斤社。陈道银站在这块麦地面前看了又看，麦苗老高，穗子老多老大，粒子圆鼓鼓地，他没有什么说的，只说了一句：“真不防这坏的地也长出这好的麦子！”
    当然，为陈道银所“不防”的事情还多的很。别说平地、岗地有高产典型，就是山地也有高产典型，光百万富翁社第七队就有十六亩千斤亩呀！
    山地、岗地、平地都有千斤亩的这个事实告诉我们，全县各地都有可能也应当达到小麦亩产千斤的水平。土质不好的三合社，明年可能成为小麦千斤社，为什么全县在一两年内不可能成为小麦千斤县呢？今年出现了二百多亩双千斤亩，为什么明年不能出现更大面积的双千斤呢？
    农业生产前途无限
    我们在这次大检查当中，发现了一件很开脑筋的事情，这就是：双千斤亩也还有许多缺点，比如说，耕的还不够深，种子还不够纯，肥料施的不够均匀，密度也不够均匀，病虫害还未断根等等。从穗子看，大的有百把粒麦子，小的只有二十几粒，而且，有的好麦子还有倒伏的现象。双千斤亩还有缺点，就是说，还有漏洞，还有潜力，双千斤以下的就不用说了。在过去，没有看见过“双千斤”，不仅不敢搞双千斤的试验，而且连想也不敢想。现在，亲眼看到了“双千斤”，更加解放了我们的思想。如果到明年，克服了现有的双千斤亩的这些缺点，那末，小麦的亩产量还能够提高多少呢？随着水利、肥料、土壤和种子等等基本条件的改善，随着农业科学技术的发展，随着农业社生产技术水平的提高，到将来，一亩地到底能够打多少小麦？在我们县，一块地不光是收小麦，还要收棉花，去年，已经有过棉麦双千斤的丰产典型，今年我们可能看到更大面积的棉麦双千斤。再过两三年，我们县能不能成为一个棉、麦双千斤的县呢？
    所有这些问题，都必须我们在今后的农业生产实践当中给予肯定的回答。我们有可能也应当对于这些问题提供比较好的答案。我们相信，党的领导力量是无穷无尽的，人民群众的集体智慧和集体力量是无穷无尽的，社会主义——共产主义制度的优越性是无穷无无的，因而，农业生产发展的前途也是不可限量的。
    经过全县党组织和农业合作社的讨论，我们有决心、有信心争取在一、两年内把全县小麦的亩产量提高到一千斤，同时，争取出现更大面积的小麦亩产双千斤和棉麦双千斤，使小麦低产作物变成高产作物，从根本上摘掉我县的低产帽子。能不能达到这个目的，关键问题在于领导。在于领导和群众相结合，更好地执行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线，在全县范围内展开一个更加深入、更加广泛的比先进、学先进、赶先进的群众运动，在全民整风高潮的基础上掀起群众性的技术革命、文化革命高潮，进一步地推动农业生产大跃进。
