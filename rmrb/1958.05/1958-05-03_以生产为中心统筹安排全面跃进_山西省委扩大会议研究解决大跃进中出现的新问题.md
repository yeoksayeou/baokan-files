Taking Production as the Center to Comprehensively Arrange the Great Leap Forward
The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Expanded Meeting Studies and Resolves New Problems Arising in the Great Leap Forward

(This newspaper) Taiyuan Dispatch: Reporter Ma Ming reports: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an expanded meeting of all members from April 8th to 16th, focusing on discussing how to continue promoting the comprehensive Great Leap Forward movement centered on industrial and agricultural production and ensuring good spring planting to strive for a full year of agricultural harvest.

According to reports from various regions (cities) committees, the overall situation in Shanxi Province is very good. There is not only the industrial and agricultural production Great Leap Forward leading the way, but also the comprehensive Great Leap Forward with all forces surging forward. The entire province is filled with vibrant and intensely working scenes. The quantity and quality of various production and construction tasks completed in the province this past winter and spring are something that could not be achieved in the past few years or even decades. The vast majority of rural cadres have also changed their work styles, going deep into the fields to plant experimental plots and taking the lead in working, and actively helping agricultural cooperatives improve labor organization and carry out tool reforms. Many places have also started mass tool reform movements. Commerce, eliminating the four pests, cultural education, and other work have also achieved great results.

In the province's comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on production, some new problems have also emerged. For example, in some areas, the production center is isolated, and a comprehensive leap forward has not been achieved; in some areas, forces are used equally, and all tasks are advancing simultaneously, with no prominent center; and some are simply relying on increasing labor intensity while neglecting to solve problems from production measures. The meeting pointed out that full attention must be paid to these new problems, the overall arrangement of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on production must be strengthened, and those phenomena of insufficient measures and insufficient mass line must be quickly corrected.

The meeting believes that May, June, and July are important junctures for completing the annual industrial and agricultural production and other tasks. It requires leaders at all levels to establish the guiding ideology of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on industrial and agricultural production, working hard for three months throughout the province to set off a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production. In order to meet the needs of this year's agricultural production increase for irrigation and drainage machinery, chemical fertilizers, and tool reforms, carrying out cultural and technological revolutions has become an urgent task.

How to ensure good spring planting and strive for a good agricultural harvest this year is another important issue discussed at the meeting. At present, some townships and cooperatives in the province have high enthusiasm, but have not yet reached the requirements of "planning to the team, measures to the land." Some townships and cooperatives have insufficient measures and drive. A very small number of townships and cooperatives still have conservative targets. The meeting believes that the main problem at present is still right-leaning conservatism, and the complacent and conservative thinking of "almost there" and "better than those below, but not as good as those above" must be overcome. It is required to make spring planting the most important central task at present, completing it early and well, while launching a rectification movement against conservatism and waste, combined with a major production inspection, to promote spring plowing production, so as to ensure the quality of spring planting, and that seedlings are complete and strong. At the same time, solve the problem of water lifting tools, strive for newly built water fields to benefit in the current year, increase fertilizer application, cultivate meticulously, reform tools, and do a good job in the management and harvesting of wheat.

The meeting pointed out that the fundamental key to solving the above problems lies in improving the leadership at all levels: First, establish a division of labor and responsibility system under collective leadership; second, when making overall arrangements for various tasks, adhere to taking industrial and agricultural production as the center, uniformly arrange, and organize mass shock movements in stages, such as eliminating the four pests; third, organize socialist cooperation between regions and departments to solve new problems in the Great Leap Forward; fourth, promote new leadership methods of cross-inspection combined with on-site meetings, competitions, and exhibitions.

The meeting also requested that leading organs at all levels establish and improve offices, use the fastest methods to promptly understand the overall situation, and solve new problems. After leading cadres at all levels frequently go deep into the grassroots, they should also pay attention to grasping the overall situation and guiding the work in various places according to local conditions.

    以生产为中心统筹安排全面跃进
    山西省委扩大会议研究解决大跃进中出现的新问题
    本报太原电　记者马明报道：中共山西省委员会4月8日到16日举行了全体委员扩大会议，着重讨论了继续促进以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进运动和保证做好春季播种、力争全年农业丰收等问题。
    根据各地（市）委的汇报，山西省当前总的形势好得很，既有一马当先的工农业生产大跃进，又有万马奔腾的全面大跃进。全省到处充满了生气蓬勃、紧张劳动的景象。去冬今春全省各项生产建设任务完成的数量和质量，都是过去几年来甚至几十年办不到的。绝大部分农村干部也转变了作风，深入田间种试验田和带头干活，并且积极帮助农业社改进劳动组织和进行工具改革。许多地方还开始了群众性的工具改革运动。商业、除四害、文化教育等工作，也取得了巨大成绩。
    在全省以生产为中心的全面大跃进中也出现了一些新的问题。比如有的地区生产中心孤立，没有做到全面跃进；有的地区平均使用力量，各项工作齐头并进，中心不突出；也有的单纯依靠增加劳动强度而忽视从生产措施上去解决问题。会议指出：必须充分注意这些新的问题，必须加强以生产为中心的全面跃进的统筹安排，并且迅速纠正那些措施不足、走群众路线不够的现象。
    会议认为，5、6、7三个月是全年工农业生产和其他各项工作完成的重要关头。要求各级领导必须树立以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的指导思想，在全省范围内，苦战三个月，掀起工农业生产的新高潮。为了满足今年农业增产对排灌机械、化学肥料和工具改革的需要，进行文化革命和技术革命已成为当前的迫切任务。
    如何保证作好春季播种、力争今年农业丰收，是会议讨论的另一个重要问题。目前全省有些乡、社热情很高，但是还没有达到“计划到队、措施到地”的要求。有些乡、社则是措施、干劲都不足。有极少数乡、社的指标仍然保守。会议认为：当前的主要问题仍然是右倾保守，必须克服“差不多”、“比上不足比下有余”的自满保守思想。要求把春播做为当前最重要的中心工作，又早又好地完成，同时开展反保守反浪费的整风运动，结合生产大检查，推动春耕生产，以便保证春播质量，苗全苗旺。同时，解决提水工具，力争新修水地当年受益，增施肥料、精耕细作、改革工具，并且做好小麦的管理和收获工作。
    会议指出：解决以上问题的根本关键在于改进各级的领导：一、建立集体领导下的分工负责制；二、在统筹安排各项工作时，坚持以工农业生产为中心，统一安排、分期组织群众性的突击运动，如除四害等；三、各地区、各部门之间组织社会主义大协作，解决大跃进中的新问题；四、推行交叉大检查结合现场会议、评比展览的新的领导方法。
    会议还要求各级领导机关都要建立、健全办公室，用最快的方法及时了解全面情况，解决新的问题。各级领导干部经常深入基层以后，还要注意掌握全面情况，因地制宜地指导各地工作。
