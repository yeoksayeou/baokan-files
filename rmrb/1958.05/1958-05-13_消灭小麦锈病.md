Eliminate Wheat Rust

    Anhui Province has recently experienced continuous rain, and wheat rust has occurred in some areas. Party and government organs at all levels immediately launched a mass campaign to prevent and control the disease in a combat-ready manner. A mass movement to eliminate diseases has taken shape in the Fuyang area. In many parts of the Anqing area, a large number of disease reporters have also been organized to organize forces to eliminate rust as soon as it is discovered.

    In the process of fighting wheat rust, in addition to ditching and draining water in wheat fields, some areas have applied fire manure, plant ash, and stove soil to wheat fields to absorb ground water and moisture. Various places also used lime-sulfur mixture to spray diseased plants to extinguish the disease. After the rescue, the phenomenon of wheat plant death in many places has been stopped.

    In order to support Anhui in eliminating wheat rust, the central government decided to airlift six million catties of sulfur blocks from Guangzhou, Chongqing and other places to Anhui.

    消灭小麦锈病
    安徽省最近阴雨连绵，部分小麦发生了锈病。各地党政机关立即以战斗的姿态，发动群众，突击防治。阜阳专区一个群众规模的消灭病害的运动已形成。安庆专区很多地方还组织了大批病情报告员，一发现锈病，就组织力量去消灭它。
    在同小麦锈病开展斗争的过程中，各地除在麦田内抽沟排水外，有的在麦田里施火粪、草木灰、锅台土等干粪，以吸收地面水份和潮气。各地还采用石灰硫磺合剂喷射病株，扑灭病害。经过抢救，不少地方小麦病株枯死现象已被制止。
    中央为支援安徽消灭小麦锈病，决定从广州、重庆等地空运六百万斤硫磺块来安徽。
