Strive for Ten Thousand Jin of Sweet Potatoes per Mu, 1,500 Jin of Rice per Mu
Changsha and Liling Farmers Pledge to Leap Forward

(Our newspaper, Changsha, May 29th, reporter Hu Jian) Farmers in Changsha, Liling, and other counties in Hunan Province, who are currently engaged in rice cultivation and fertilizer application, have revised their summer production plans after hearing the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in order to work even harder to realize the general line of socialist construction.

Farmers in Gaoling, Bailu, Hexin, and other townships in Changsha County, who were the first to hear the news of the conference's closing, organized discussions among commune members overnight and held several mass rallies of hundreds of people to pledge an early realization of the Forty Articles of Agriculture program. At a rally of more than two hundred people in Gaoling Township, it was decided to drain the waterlogged areas and replant rice seedlings in a concentrated effort over two days to heal the damage caused by waterlogging. Inspired by the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress," the number of people working in Changsha County increased from more than 350,000 to 400,000 every day. Many agricultural cooperatives have revised their summer production plans. The county's planned area for summer sweet potatoes has been increased from the original 50,000 mu to 100,000 mu, striving to achieve the goal of "ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes per mu."

The Babuqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, which aims to achieve a yield of 1,500 jin of rice per mu this year, organized its members on the evening of the 27th, based on the cooperative's situation, to discuss specific measures for implementing the general line of socialist construction. It was decided that the 540 mu of early rice in the cooperative would be fertilized three times instead of the original plan of two times. Eighty mu of rice seedlings that are growing poorly will be fertilized with 100 dan of concentrated fertilizer per mu, requiring all seedlings to catch up to the best quality. The original plan to apply 1,000 dan of fertilizer to late rice has now been increased to 1,200 dan.

    力争亩产万斤薯　水稻亩产一千五
    长沙醴陵农民誓师跃进
    本报长沙29日电　记者胡坚报道：正在进行水稻中耕追肥的湖南省长沙、醴陵等县农民，在听到中共“八大”二次会议闭幕的消息后，纷纷修订夏季生产计划，为实现社会主义建设总路线，更出色地劳动。
    最早听到会议闭幕消息的长沙县高岭、百禄、合心等乡农民，都连夜组织社员进行了讨论，并召开了好几百人的提前实现四十条纲要的跃进誓师大会。高岭乡在二百多人的誓师大会上决定两天突击排干渍水，进行重插禾苗，医治水害创伤。长沙全县在“八大”会议精神的鼓舞下，每天出勤人数由三十五万多人增加到四十万人。很多农业社都修订了夏季生产计划。全县夏红薯由原计划五万亩增加到十万亩，力争实现“红薯万斤县”。
    要求今年实现水稻亩产一千五百斤的醴陵县八步桥农业社，在27日晚上，根据社里情况组织社员讨论了贯彻社会主义建设总路线的具体措施。决定全社五百四十亩早稻，由原计划?两次改三次；对八十亩生长较差的禾苗，每亩追精肥一百担，要求都赶上一类禾。原计划晚稻施肥一千担，现在增加到一千二百担。
