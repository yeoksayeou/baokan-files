Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The Learning Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today notified the learning committees of CPPCC in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to organize people from all democratic parties and industrialists and businessmen to study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).

The notification from the Learning Committee of the CPPCC National Committee stated that the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China formulated a general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and criticized modern revisionism. This is a great event of historical significance. The notification suggests that local CPPCC organizations, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the local Party committees, should organize people from all democratic parties and industrialists and businessmen to study the two documents of the session in conjunction with the rectification movement: the work report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to the session and the resolution of the session on the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow.

The notification pointed out that this study is closely and inseparably linked to the current rectification movement and is also the most powerful weapon and basis for further deepening the rectification, conducting personal ideological examinations, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The learning method must be closely integrated with reality, focusing on issues existing in the local area, and adopting the method of rectification, which is to say, vigorously airing views, fully expressing opinions, engaging in extensive debates, and using big-character posters, supplemented by necessary enlightening reports and answering questions. The organization of learning at the county, city, and municipal district levels, as well as the arrangement of learning time, shall be determined independently by the learning committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality within the scope uniformly prescribed by the local Party committees.

    政协全委会通知各地组织
    结合整风运动学好八大文件
    新华社29日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会今天通知政协各省、自治区、市学习委员会，组织各界民主人士和工商业者学习中共八大二次会议的文件。
    政协全国委员会学习委员会的通知说，中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，批判了现代修正主义。这是具有历史意义的伟大事件。通知建议各地政协在当地党委统一领导和布置下，组织各界民主人士和工商业者，结合整风运动，学习会议的两个文件：刘少奇同志代表中共中央向会议所作的工作报告以及会议关于在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的决议。
    通知指出，这一学习是同当前的整风运动密切不可分割的，也是进一步深入整风、进行个人思想检查和展开批评与自我批评的最有力的武器和依据。学习方法必须密切结合实际，就当地存在的问题选择重点，采用整风的方法，也就是大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法来进行，辅以必要的启发报告和解答问题。县、市和市辖区的学习如何组织及学习时间的安排，由各省、自治区、市学习委员会在当地党委统一规定范围自行商定。
