    Never Put Down the Gun
  　Lieutenant Xu Xianguo
    Thank you, Elder Guo, for the praise.
    We will go to war against the Earth.
    Raise high the banner of science and technology,
    Overcome difficulties and conquer nature.
    A red heart dedicated to the Party,
    Heroes disarm and return to the battlefield.
    Not like the old days, fully armed on ships,
    Not like the old days, holding spears to cross the Yangtze River.
    Our children leave the team to go north,
    Responding to the call to expedition the Great Northern Wilderness.
    Using the hand that held the gun to pick up the hoe,
    Forcing the land to yield food.
    Let the blood-stained military uniform
    Receive the reward of machine oil and mud.
    Let the scars pierced by bullets
    Glow red on the black earth.
    A red heart dedicated to the Party,
    Heroes disarm but never put down the gun.

    永不放下枪
  　少尉　徐先国
    感谢郭老称赞
    我们去向地球开战
    举起科学技术大旗
    冲过艰难战胜自然
    一颗红心交给党
    英雄解甲重上战场
    不是当年整装上舰艇
    不是当年横戈渡长江
    儿女离队要北上
    响应号令远征北大荒
    用拿枪的手把起锄头
    强迫土地交出食粮
    让血迹浸染的军装
    受到机油和泥土的奖赏
    让子弹穿透的疤伤
    在黑土地上泛红发光
    一颗红心交给党
    英雄解甲永不放下枪
