The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, after hearing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries held from November 14 to 16, 1957, and the Meeting of Representatives of 64 Communist and Workers' Parties held from November 16 to 19 in Moscow, unanimously approved the declarations adopted by these two meetings and expressed satisfaction with the work carried out by the Chinese Communist Party delegation, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, during these two meetings.

The Moscow meetings of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the two declarations adopted opened a new stage in the modern international communist movement and gave tremendous encouragement to the working people of the world and all forces for peace, democracy, and progress. These two declarations have been welcomed and supported by communist parties around the world. The Communist Party of the United States, after clearing out the revisionist elements like Gates, also agreed with the views of the declaration. Only the League of Communists of Yugoslavia not only openly opposed the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries but also adopted a completely revisionist program against Marxism-Leninism at its Seventh Congress to confront the Moscow meeting's declaration. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, such as Tito, in order to defend their anti-Marxist-Leninist, completely revisionist program, launched a series of malicious attacks at their congress on the international communist movement and the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union, while expressing flattery and gratitude to the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism.

Upholding the views in the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, defending the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, and opposing modern revisionism are major tasks of the current international communist movement.

The declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries summarized the experiences of the international communist movement over the past century, especially the last forty years, elucidated the common principles that communist parties in various countries must abide by in socialist revolution and socialist construction, put forward the fundamental policies for communist parties in various countries to unite the broad masses of the people to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism, laid the ideological and political foundation for the unity of communist parties in various countries, and strengthened the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This is a programmatic document of epoch-making significance in the international communist movement.

The declaration analyzed the current international situation, pointing out that "the development of the world depends on the process and outcome of the competition between two opposing social systems"; pointing out that "socialism is developing upward, while imperialism is declining"; pointing out that the colonial system is collapsing; pointing out that "capitalist economy cannot avoid new, profound shocks and crises." The declaration pointed out that the fundamental question of world politics has become whether it is war or peaceful coexistence, and that the existence of imperialism is the source of aggressive wars; pointing out that the imperialist aggressive groups of the United States have become the center of reactionary forces around the world and the most ferocious enemy of the masses of the people of all countries, "The policies pursued by these anti-people imperialist aggressive forces are digging their own graves and creating their own gravediggers." At the same time, the declaration also pointed out that the forces of peace have grown greatly and that there is a practical possibility to prevent war, and standing at the forefront of this force of peace is the indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The declaration pointed out: "The union of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war. If the imperialist warmongers insist on launching a war regardless of everything, then imperialism is doomed to destruction, because the people will never continue to tolerate a system that brings them such pain and sacrifice."

The "Peace Declaration" adopted by the Meeting of Representatives of 64 Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out that the threat to the cause of peace and to the safety of the people of all countries comes from "monopoly capital groups that have made huge fortunes in the two world wars and in the current arms race." The declaration called on all good people around the world to organize and strive for peace.

The correctness of the assessment of the international situation in the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries is being proven by the development of facts. In the past six months, in the socialist camp, the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet Union, China, and many other fraternal countries has shown a booming situation. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements against imperialism and its lackeys have made new developments, and in some countries, fierce struggles are underway. At the same time, the imperialist countries have entered a new, serious, and profound economic crisis. This economic crisis first occurred in the most developed capitalist country, the United States, and the economic crisis in the United States is impacting the entire capitalist world. On the issue of peace and war, the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and other fraternal countries have put forward a series of peace proposals. The Soviet Union has taken the lead in suspending nuclear weapons tests, and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and our government have jointly decided to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. These facts show to the people of the world that the countries of the socialist camp are willing to make the greatest efforts to strive for peace. However, the aggressive group headed by US imperialism, despite the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, continues to refuse to stop nuclear weapons tests, refuse to stop the Cold War, refuse to reduce armaments, refuse to withdraw troops from Korea, and does everything possible to delay the holding of summit meetings. US imperialism has always occupied our country's Taiwan. The US imperialists openly interfere in the internal affairs of Indonesia, providing aid and assistance to the rebel groups in Indonesia, and now they want to interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon. It should be vigilant that US imperialism and the imperialist group headed by the United States are still actively carrying out war threats, preparing for new wars, and intensifying political, economic, and cultural aggression against many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, undermining the internal unity of these countries, and even directly suppressing national liberation movements by force. Our task is to unite all peace-loving forces in the world to safeguard peace and crush the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive group headed by the United States.

The declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries pointed out that in order to adhere to the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of revolution and construction in various countries, it is necessary to pay attention to overcoming revisionism and dogmatism. The declaration emphasized the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism—dialectical materialism—opposing metaphysics and idealism, believing that "applying dialectical materialism in practical work and using Marxism-Leninism to educate cadres and the broad masses is one of the urgent tasks of communist and workers' parties." Regarding the question of what is the current main danger in the international communist movement, the declaration clearly answered: "Under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism. It is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, which paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism." The declaration pointed out: "The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism. Succumbing to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign root of revisionism." The declaration paid special attention to the emergence of modern revisionism, pointing out: "Modern revisionism attempts to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is 'outdated' and seems to have lost its significance for social development at present. Revisionists try to corrupt the revolutionary soul of Marxism and undermine the confidence of the working class and working people in socialism. They deny the historical necessity of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, deny the leading role of Marxist-Leninist parties, deny the principles of proletarian internationalism, and demand the abandonment of Leninism's basic principles of party building, especially the abandonment of democratic centralism, demanding that the communist party be transformed from a fighting revolutionary organization into some kind of disputing club."

We, the Chinese communists, like the communists of all countries, are pleased to see that since the declaration was issued, the fraternal parties of the socialist camp have made new achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, in ideological and political work, and in unity and cooperation. The fraternal parties of capitalist countries have also made new progress in the struggle against revisionism and right-wing traitors, in consolidating their own ranks, defending the Marxist-Leninist unity of the party, strengthening the party's combat effectiveness, and in establishing close ties with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other working people.

Obviously, for the common cause of the world proletariat and the common struggle against imperialism, the unity of communist parties of various countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism is particularly important. Fraternal parties should strengthen their mutual ties. All words and actions that are detrimental to unity are harmful and must be resolutely opposed.

The declaration's assertion that the current main danger is revisionism, that is, right-wing opportunism, has also been proven by the facts. Recently, the "Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia" adopted by its Seventh Congress betrayed the principles of Marxism-Leninism on a series of fundamental issues, opposed the declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, and violated the "Peace Declaration" of the Meeting of Representatives of 64 Communist and Workers' Parties, which was signed by the representative of the League of Communist of Yugoslavia. The LCY Congress has the right to adopt its own program, and the communist parties of various countries also have the right, and the responsibility, to criticize the LCY's revisionist program and fight to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on the one hand, asserts that "the vigorously developing state capitalist trend in the capitalist world proves extremely clearly that mankind is irresistibly entering the socialist era through various paths"; and asserts that the state organs of the capitalist world are "regulators of labor relations and property relations, social rights and social services, and other social relations," and are increasingly "restricting the role of private capital" and "depriving private capital owners of certain independent functions in the economy and society." On the other hand, the LCY program describes the ownership by the whole people, that is, state ownership, in socialist countries as "state capitalism," believing that "bureaucracy and bureaucratic state-ism tendencies" are directly produced on the basis of this so-called "state capitalism." The LCY program thus uglifies socialism while beautifying capitalism, and uglifies the dictatorship of the proletariat while beautifying the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believes that "socialist elements" are being formed within capitalist countries, and that the working class can "ensure the development of socialism" as long as it "constantly exerts pressure" on the bourgeois state apparatus and strives to "gain a decisive influence" in this state apparatus. Here, the LCY program spreads the fallacies of not wanting proletarian revolution, not smashing the capitalist state apparatus, and not establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to corrupt the revolutionary will of the working class in capitalist countries.

The leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia flaunts itself as being above the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, but this is not actually the case; the spearhead of their attack has always been directed at the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, while they dare not touch US imperialism at all. They describe the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, two fundamentally different world political and economic systems, as "the world being split into two hostile military-political blocs," and try their best to uglify the socialist camp while beautifying the imperialist camp. It should be pointed out that many countries, although they are not socialist countries, adopt a neutral policy of opposing war and supporting peace, which is of positive significance for maintaining world peace, is opposed by the forces of imperialist aggression, and is sympathized with by the peace-loving people of all countries. However, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's so-called non-bloc stance of undermining the unity of socialist countries caters to the policy of the US-led imperialist anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and anti-socialist camp, and therefore receives the cheers and bonuses of US imperialists.

The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia cites some words and phrases of Marxism-Leninism merely to put on the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, making it easier to deceive others. In terms of ideological methods, this program uses sophistry that reverses black and white and confuses right and wrong to replace revolutionary materialist dialectics; in politics, it uses a reactionary supra-class theory of the state to replace the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, and uses reactionary bourgeois nationalism to replace revolutionary proletarian internationalism; in political economics, it defends monopoly capital and confuses the fundamental differences between capitalism and socialism. The Yugoslav revisionists have betrayed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the proletarian class struggle, proletarian revolution, and proletarian dictatorship, and they have also completely abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on proletarian political parties. They promote a set of fallacies that abolish the leading role of the Communist Party in socialist revolution and socialist construction, attack the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, and slander the communist parties of capitalist countries as "no longer revolutionary and creative driving forces promoting social development in their own countries," with the aim of attempting to undermine and disintegrate the communist parties of various countries.

This completely revisionist program was put forward in order to split the international communist movement, precisely at a time when the general crisis of capitalism is deepening and when the paralyzing effect of the revisionism of right-wing social democrats on the working class and working masses is weakening, so this program's service to imperialism, especially US imperialism, is like "sending charcoal in the snow."

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China believes that the criticism made in the Cominform's "Resolution on the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" in 1948, which criticized the Communist Party of Yugoslavia for abandoning the principles of Marxism-Leninism and embarking on the wrong path of bourgeois nationalism, was basically correct and necessary, but there were shortcomings and errors in the methods used to handle this issue at that time. Our party agreed with and supported this criticism at that time. The second resolution on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia adopted by the Cominform in 1949 was erroneous, and the communist parties of various countries participating in the Cominform meeting later revoked this resolution. Since 1954, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, initiated the improvement of relations with Yugoslavia and took a series of measures to this end, which was completely necessary and correct. This initiative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was approved by all socialist countries and communist parties of various countries. We also took steps consistent with the Soviet Union and established relations between the two parties and two countries of China and Yugoslavia. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and some relevant communist parties made necessary self-criticisms of the shortcomings in the past in dealing with the issue of relations with Yugoslavia, out of a desire for unity. Since then, the communist parties of various countries have made sincere and exhaustive efforts to improve relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, patiently waiting for the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to return to the Marxist-Leninist position. However, leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia completely disregarded the goodwill efforts of the communist parties of various countries, never recognized their own mistakes, and did not make any self-criticism. Not only that, they have also constantly attacked and slandered socialist countries and communist parties of various countries, even going so far as to echo the imperialist attacks on the socialist camp and the international communist movement. In the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, they played a very disreputable role as a provocateur and intervener, and it was only because the leading comrades of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party consistently adhered to a solemn and correct stance in suppressing the rebellion and after quelling the rebellion that their conspiracy did not succeed. And now, after the Moscow meeting strengthened the unity of communist parties of various countries, they have expressed their stubborn anti-Marxist-Leninist position in their own program, and are filled with hostility towards socialist countries and communist parties of various countries. There is no doubt that this position and behavior of the Yugoslav leaders shows that they have cut themselves off from the international communist ranks, which is completely unfavorable to the sincere communists of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav people.

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China fully agrees with the decision of the Central Committee of the Party not to send a delegation but only to send observers to attend the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. And it unanimously believes that it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism that has emerged in the international communist movement. To thoroughly crush modern revisionism politically and theoretically together with the fraternal parties of various countries, to defend Marxism-Leninism, and to defend the unity of the international communist movement on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism, is our party's sacred duty to the international working class.

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China fully believes that the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism will surely overcome any obstacles and achieve new and great victories worldwide.

    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议
    关于在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的决议
    （一九五八年五月二十三日）
    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议，听取了邓小平同志关于一九五七年十一月十四日至十六日在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议和十六日至十九日举行的六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议的报告以后，一致同意这两个会议所通过的宣言，对于以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党代表团在这两个会议期间所进行的工作表示满意。
    各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议和所通过的两个宣言，开辟了现代国际共产主义运动的新阶段，给了全世界的劳动人民和一切和平民主进步的力量以极大的鼓舞。这两个宣言得到了全世界共产主义政党的欢迎和拥护。美国共产党在清除了修正主义分子盖茨之后，也同意了宣言的观点。只有南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟不但对社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言公开地表示反对的态度，而且在它的第七次代表大会上通过了一个反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，来同莫斯科会议的宣言相对抗。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人铁托等，为着替他们的反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领辩护，在他们的代表大会上，对于以苏联为中心的国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营进行了一系列恶意的攻击，而对于全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美国帝国主义则表示了逢迎和感恩戴德。
    坚持社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中的观点，保卫马克思列宁主义的根本原则，反对现代修正主义，是当前国际共产主义运动的一个重大任务。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言，总结了一百年来特别是近四十年来的国际共产主义运动的经验，阐明了各国共产党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中必须遵守的共同原则，提出了各国共产党团结广大人民群众为和平、民主和社会主义事业而奋斗的根本方针，奠定了各国共产党团结的思想政治基础，加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。这是国际共产主义运动中具有划时代意义的纲领性的文件。
    宣言分析了当前的国际形势，指出了“世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果”；指出了“社会主义在向上发展，而帝国主义却在衰退”；指出了殖民主义体系正在瓦解；指出了“资本主义经济不能避免新的、深刻的震动和危机”。宣言指出了，是战争还是和平共处已经成为世界政治的根本问题，而帝国主义的存在是侵略战争的根源；指出了美国的帝国主义侵略集团已经成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为各国人民群众的最凶恶的敌人，“这些反人民的帝国主义侵略势力所实行的政策使它们自取灭亡，自己造成埋葬自己的掘墓人”。同时，宣言又指出了，和平的力量已经大大成长，已经有实际的可能来防止战争，而站在这个和平力量的最前列的，是不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。宣言指出了：“这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议所通过的“和平宣言”指出：对于和平事业的威胁，对于各国人民安全的威胁，是来自“在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团”。宣言向全世界一切善良的人们呼吁：组织起来，争取和平。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言对于国际形势的估计的正确性，正被事实的发展所证明。半年以来，在社会主义阵营里，苏联、中国和其它许多兄弟国家的经济建设和文化建设都出现了蒸蒸日上的形势。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，反对帝国主义及其走狗的民族解放运动有了新的发展，而且在一些国家中，正在进行激烈的斗争。同时，帝国主义国家却进入新的严重的深刻的经济危机。这个经济危机是首先在资本主义最发达的美国发生的，美国的经济危机正在冲击着整个资本主义世界。在和平与战争的问题上，苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚和其他兄弟国家提出了一系列的和平建议，苏联已经首先停止了核武器试验，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和我国政府共同决定从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军，这些事实在全世界人民面前表示了社会主义阵营各国为争取和平愿意尽最大的努力。但是以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，却至今不顾世界各国人民的和平愿望，继续拒绝停止核武器试验，拒绝停止冷战，拒绝裁减军备，拒绝从朝鲜撤兵，千方百计拖延最高级会议的召开。美帝国主义一直霸占着我国的台湾。美帝国主义者居然公开干涉印度尼西亚的内政，接济和援助印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，现在又要干涉黎巴嫩的内政。应该警惕，美帝国主义和以美国为首的帝国主义集团还在积极进行战争威胁，准备新的战争，加紧对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的许多国家进行政治、经济、文化的侵略，破坏这些国家内部的团结，以至直接用武力镇压民族解放运动。我们的任务，是要团结全世界一切爱好和平的力量来维护和平，粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团的战争阴谋。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言指出，为了坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同各国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的原则，必须注意克服修正主义和教条主义。宣言强调马克思列宁主义的理论基础——辩证唯物论，反对形而上学和唯心论，认为“在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育干部和广大群众，是共产党和工人党的迫切任务之一”。关于什么是国际共产主义运动中当前主要危险的问题，宣言明确地答复说：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”宣言指出：“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源。”宣言特别注意到现代修正主义的出现，指出：“现代修正主义企图诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，说它是‘过了时的’，似乎目前对于社会发展已经丧失了意义。修正主义者力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，破坏工人阶级和劳动人民对于社会主义的信心。他们否认在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期实行无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史必要性，否认马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，否认无产阶级国际主义原则，要求放弃列宁主义关于党的建设的基本原则，首先是放弃民主集中制，要求把共产党从一个战斗的革命组织变成某种争论不休的俱乐部。”
    我们中国共产党人同各国共产党人一样，高兴地看到，宣言发表以来，社会主义阵营各国的兄弟党，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业方面，在思想政治工作方面，在团结合作方面，都有了新的成就。资本主义各国的兄弟党，在反对修正主义和右派叛徒的斗争中，在巩固自己的队伍，保卫党的马克思列宁主义的统一，加强党的战斗力的工作中，在同工人和农民以及其他劳动人民广大群众建立亲密联系的工作中，也有了新的进展。
    显然，为着全世界无产阶级的共同事业，进行反对帝国主义的共同斗争，各国共产党在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结一致是特别重要的。各兄弟党应该加强相互间的联系。一切不利于团结的言论和行动都是有害的，都必须坚决反对。
    宣言关于当前主要危险是修正主义即右倾机会主义的断定，也被事实所证明。最近南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领”，在一系列的根本问题上背叛马克思列宁主义的原则，对抗社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言，并且违反南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表所曾经签字的六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议的“和平宣言”。南共代表大会有权利通过自己的纲领，各国共产党同样有权利，也有责任，批判南共这个修正主义的纲领，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而斗争。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的这个纲领，一方面断言，“资本主义世界蓬勃发展的国家资本主义趋势极其明显地证明：人类正在通过各种途径不可阻挡地深深地进入了社会主义时代”；并且断言，资本主义世界的国家机构是“劳动关系和财产关系、社会权利和社会服务以及其他社会关系的调节者”，正在日益“限制私人资本作用”和“剥夺私人资本所有者在经济和社会中的某些独立职能”。另一方面，南共纲领又把社会主义国家的全民所有制即国有制，说成是“国家资本主义”，他们认为在这种所谓“国家资本主义”的基础上直接产生“官僚主义和官僚国家主义偏向”。南共纲领就是这样，丑化社会主义而美化资本主义，丑化无产阶级专政而美化资产阶级专政。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领，认为“社会主义因素”正在资本主义国家内部形成起来，工人阶级只要对资产阶级国家机构“不断施加压力”，争取在这种国家机构中“取得决定性的影响”，就能够“保证社会主义的发展”。南共纲领在这里散布不要无产阶级革命、不要打碎资本主义的国家机器、不要建立无产阶级专政的谬论，企图腐蚀资本主义国家工人阶级的革命意志。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导集团标榜自己是超出于社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之外，实际上并不是如此；他们攻击的矛头一直是对着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，而对于美帝国主义却丝毫不敢触动。他们把社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营这两种根本不同性质的世界政治经济体系，说成是“世界分裂为两个敌对的军事政治集团”，并且尽量丑化社会主义阵营而美化帝国主义阵营。应当指出，有不少国家，虽然不是社会主义国家，但是它们采取反对战争、拥护和平的中立政策，对于维持世界和平是有积极意义的，是受到帝国主义侵略势力的反对的，是得到各国爱好和平的人民的同情的。而南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团的破坏社会主义国家团结的所谓超集团的立场，却是迎合了以美国为首的帝国主义反共、反苏、反社会主义阵营的政策，因而得到了美国帝国主义者的喝采和奖金。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领援引马克思列宁主义的一些词句，仅仅是为了披上马克思列宁主义的外衣，便于欺骗别人。这个纲领在思想方法上是用颠倒黑白、混淆是非的诡辩代替革命的唯物辩证法，在政治上是用反动的超阶级的国家论代替马克思列宁主义的国家论，用反动的资产阶级民族主义代替革命的无产阶级国际主义，在政治经济学上是为垄断资本辩护，混淆资本主义和社会主义的根本区别。南斯拉夫修正主义者背叛了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级的阶级斗争、无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论，他们也就完全抛弃了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级政党的学说。他们宣传一套取消共产党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的领导作用的谬论，攻击社会主义各国的共产党和工人党，并且诬蔑资本主义国家的共产党“在本国不再是促进社会发展的革命性、创造性的推动因素”，其目的是妄图破坏和瓦解各国共产党。
    这个彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，是为了分裂国际共产主义运动而提出来的，是恰恰在资本主义总危机加深的时候，在右翼社会党人的修正主义对工人阶级和劳动群众的麻痹作用日益减弱的时候提出来的，因而这个纲领对于帝国主义特别是美国帝国主义的效劳，等于“雪中送炭”。
    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议认为，一九四八年，共产党情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的决议”中，对于南斯拉夫共产党背弃了马克思列宁主义原则而走上了资产阶级民族主义的错误道路所进行的批评，基本上是正确的和必要的，但是当时在处理这个问题的方法上有缺点和错误。我们党当时同意和支持了这次批评。一九四九年，共产党情报局所通过的关于南斯拉夫共产党的第二个决议则是错误的，参加情报局会议的各国共产党后来撤消了这个决议。一九五四年以来，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央创议改善同南斯拉夫的关系，并且为此采取了一系列措施，这是完全必要的和正确的。苏联共产党的这个创议得到了所有社会主义国家和各国共产党的赞同。我们也采取了同苏联一致的步骤，建立了中南两国两党的关系。苏联共产党和一些有关的共产党从团结的愿望出发，对过去在对待南斯拉夫关系问题上的缺点作了必要的自我批评。从那时以来，各国共产党为了改善同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系，作了仁至义尽的努力，耐心地等待南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人重新回到马克思列宁主义的立场上来。但是，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人完全无视各国共产党的善意的努力，始终没有认识自己的错误，没有作任何自我批评。不但如此，他们还不断地对社会主义各国和各国共产党进行攻击和诬蔑，甚至不惜附和帝国主义对社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的进攻。他们在匈牙利反革命叛乱事件中，扮演了一个挑拨者和干涉者的很不光彩的角色，只是由于匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导同志在镇压叛乱中和平定叛乱后一贯地坚持了严正的正确的立场，才使他们的阴谋没有得逞。而现在，在莫斯科会议增强了各国共产党团结之后，他们却在自己的纲领中表示了自己的顽强的反马克思列宁主义的立场，并且对于各社会主义国家和各国共产党充满了敌意。毫无疑问，南斯拉夫领导人的这种立场和行为，表明他们自己自绝于国际共产主义队伍，这对于南斯拉夫真诚的共产主义者和南斯拉夫人民是完全不利的。
    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议，完全同意党的中央委员会不派代表团而仅派观察员列席南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的决定。并且一致认为，必须同国际共产主义运动中出现的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。同各国兄弟党一起，在政治上和理论上彻底粉碎现代修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上的统一，是我们党对国际工人阶级的神圣义务。
    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议完全相信，和平、民主、社会主义事业一定会克服任何阻碍，在世界范围内取得新的伟大的胜利。
