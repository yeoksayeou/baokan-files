Wangcheng County Party Committee Acts Quickly:
    Grasping New and Old Factories Simultaneously
    Changsha, May 8th (reported by this newspaper) - The Wangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly adopted effective measures to quickly reverse the tendency of focusing on building new factories and mines while neglecting the leadership of old factories and mines in the development of local industry.
    In the recent period, the county has shown great enthusiasm for developing local industry. By mid-April, it had built nearly six hundred small factories, manufacturing and repairing 120,000 pieces of various agricultural implements and tools, and producing 6,721 dan of granular fertilizer, which strongly supported the great leap forward in agricultural production. However, while building new factories, it relaxed its leadership over the original fifteen factories, resulting in these factories only completing slightly more than one-tenth of their annual leap forward plan for the first quarter. After discovering this situation, the Wangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a field meeting of all township Party committee secretaries and factory and mine Party branch secretaries, identified the reasons why these fifteen small factories had failed to complete their leap forward plans, and immediately decided to transfer twenty-two cadres to strengthen factory and mine leadership. Now, the county committee has re-arranged the leadership cadres for the fifteen old factories that have not performed well in completing their plans and is vigorously addressing the weak links. The factories have also adopted some specific measures internally to improve production management. (Cheng Kun)

    望城县委眼快手快
    新厂老厂一齐抓
    本报长沙8日电　中共湖南望城县委及时采取有效措施，迅速扭转了在发展地方工业中抓了新建厂矿，放松领导老厂矿的偏向。
    这个县在最近一段时期发展地方工业劲头很大，到4月中旬已新建近六百个小厂，制造修配各种农具工具十二万件，颗粒肥料六千七百二十一担，有力地支援了农业生产大跃进。但是，在建设新工厂的时候，却放松对原有的十五个工厂的领导，致使这些工厂第一季度生产总值只完成全年跃进计划的十分之一强。中共望城县委发现这一情况后，最近召开了全县乡镇党委书记、厂矿党支部书记战地会议，找出这十五个小厂没有完成跃进计划的原因，并立即决定抽调二十二名干部充实厂矿领导。现在县委对完成计划不好的十五个老厂的领导干部力量重新作了安排，并大力抓薄弱环节。各厂厂内也采取了一些具体办法，改进生产管理工作。　（程坤）
