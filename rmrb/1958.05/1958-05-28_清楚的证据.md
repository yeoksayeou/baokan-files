Notes

    Clear Evidence
    On the evening of May 26th, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said at a Conservative Party gathering that there was "clear evidence" that "outside forces" were interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. Lloyd did not announce which country the "outside forces" referred to, nor what the so-called "evidence" actually consisted of.
    In fact, besides the United States, it is precisely Britain itself that is interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. Just two days before Lloyd made this statement, a spokesman for the British Ministry of Defence publicly announced that British troops in Cyprus were on standby, ready to enter Lebanon at any time. At the same time, Britain, like the United States, is constantly airlifting weapons to the Lebanese government to be used to massacre the people. Isn't this clear evidence of Britain's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs?

    清楚的证据
    5月26日晚，英国外交大臣劳埃德在一次保守党的集会上说，有“清楚的证据”可以证明“外界”干涉黎巴嫩内政。劳埃德并没有宣布，“外界”是指的那一个国家，所谓“证据”到底是些什么内容。
    其实，除了美国以外，干涉黎巴嫩内政的正是英国自己。就在劳埃德讲这段话的前两天，英国国防部的发言人公开宣布，塞浦路斯的英国军队已整装待命，准备随时进入黎巴嫩。同时，英国也和美国一样，不断空运武器给黎巴嫩政府，以用来屠杀人民。难道这还不是英国干涉黎巴嫩内政的清楚的证据么？
