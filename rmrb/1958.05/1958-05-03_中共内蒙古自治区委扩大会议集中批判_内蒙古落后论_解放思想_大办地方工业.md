(Our newspaper, Baotou, 2nd dispatch) "The whole party runs industry, all levels run industry, comprehensive planning, strengthen leadership, follow the mass line, while vigorously realizing the autonomous region's great leap forward plan for agriculture and animal husbandry, make local industry bloom everywhere in the autonomous region and develop in an all-round way." This was the central topic of the Sixth Plenary Committee Enlarged Meeting of the CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee held in Baotou City from April 16th to 27th. The meeting believes that the great leap forward in industry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is conditional, and the key lies in breaking through the shackles of dogmatism, empiricism, and right-leaning conservative thinking, twisting the enthusiasm of hundreds of thousands of cadres and nine million people of all ethnic groups into one rope, exerting full effort, striving for advancement, and building with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Comrades attending the meeting listened to the important instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao conveyed by Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, they put forward sharp criticisms and improvement opinions on the excessively strict basic construction procedures, the overly rigid postal and telecommunications and banking regulations, and some unreasonable systems in enterprise management. The meeting focused on analyzing and criticizing the "Inner Mongolia Backwardness Theory." Everyone pointed out that there are two views on the actual situation in Inner Mongolia: one is to realistically acknowledge backwardness in some aspects and actively try every means to change backwardness, which is in line with the socialist construction line of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, exerting full effort, and striving for advancement. This is communist thought. The other is to shout difficulties everywhere, bow down to backwardness, and even protect backwardness. This belongs to the line of less, slower, worse, more expensive, and cold and cheerless, which is non-communist thought. Those who believe in the backwardness theory think that everything in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is backward and nothing is good. They excessively emphasized Inner Mongolia's backward economic foundation, poor natural conditions, and lack of work experience. Therefore, they always emphasized unfavorable objective conditions in their work and even carried the backward economic foundation and culture as burdens, using them as shields for not doing their work well.

The meeting also analyzed the reasons for the emergence of the Inner Mongolia backwardness theory through specific examples. The historically backward economic foundation had an impact on people. When objective conditions changed, these people could not see new things, and their thinking lagged behind reality. Second, they were afraid of difficulties and bowed down to difficulties. Third, Han chauvinism and local nationalism were also one of the ideological roots of the Inner Mongolia backwardness theory. People with remnants of Han chauvinism always felt that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was not as good as the interior; people with remnants of local nationalism often clung to old ways and were unwilling to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced.

The meeting also criticized dogmatism and empiricism. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region spans the three northern regions (Northeast, North China, Northwest), and cadres come from all directions. The good aspect is that it has absorbed advanced experience from various places and accelerated the construction of the autonomous region. The bad thing is that many comrades rely on the experience they brought from various places and have not integrated well with the actual situation in the autonomous region. They rely on dogma and old experience and do not even read the Inner Mongolia Daily. The meeting believes that if the above-mentioned incorrect thoughts are not overcome, it will hinder the early realization of the socialist construction line of exerting full effort, striving for advancement, and building with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, the meeting believes that it is necessary to seriously study the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carry out the ideological liberation movement, and further deeply and widely publicize the construction achievements and construction prospects of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

After analyzing the current situation of the leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia, the meeting pointed out that Inner Mongolia will reach 6.334 million hectares of cultivated land within five years, and the average yield per mu of grain will reach 400 jin; the number of livestock will reach 40 million head. It is also possible to realize settled nomadic life and establish feed bases with sufficient water sources in pastoral areas, and to carry out pasture improvement work on the basis of cooperation. In particular, the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base will be completed ahead of schedule within five years, the Greater Khingan Range Forest Industrial Base will expand its construction, and the Chifeng Coalfield will be mined on a large scale. These all require local industries to quickly catch up. The meeting believes that as long as the mysterious view of industrialization is broken, the construction guidelines stipulated by the central government are seriously implemented, and the total output value of local industries exceeds twelve times the current total output value within five years, exceeds the total output value of agricultural and sideline production, and strives to make the output value of local industries catch up with the output value of agricultural and animal husbandry production within three years is entirely possible.

The meeting believes that to accelerate the development of industry in the autonomous region, existing cities with more industries—Baotou, Hohhot, Hailar, etc.—must be used as economic cooperation zones and technical reform centers, and existing enterprises must be fully utilized to further establish a cooperation system and form an industrial network that combines points and areas, urban and rural areas, and large, medium, and small enterprises. This year, it is necessary to actively carry out exploration and design work, and actively develop factories that are small in scale, require little investment, are quick to build, and have large returns, especially those for improving agricultural tools, manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery and small and medium-sized industrial equipment, as well as non-ferrous metals, small coal mines, small smelters, and small fertilizer plants. For enterprises with larger investments and more complex technologies, such as fertilizer plants, chemical plants, and oil shale oil refineries, specific personnel should also be quickly designated to carry out specific preparatory work so that factories can be started and built in a timely manner. The meeting believes that to vigorously develop industry, it is also necessary to organize a team for vigorously developing industry (including training ethnic minority workers). First of all, the industrial leadership institutions of party and government at all levels must be established immediately, cadres must be immediately equipped, and the training of technical personnel must be accelerated, striving to train more than 200,000 various workers within five years. The method is that old factories help new factories, large factories help small factories, state-owned factories help local factories, banners and counties help townships and communes, establish cooperative relationships, divide up responsibilities, and old factories "lay eggs."

    中共内蒙古自治区委扩大会议集中批判“内蒙古落后论”
    解放思想  大办地方工业
    本报包头2日电　“全党办工业，各级办工业，全面规划，加强领导，走群众路线，在大力实现自治区农牧业大跃进规划的同时，使
  地方工业在自治区遍地开花，全面发展起来。”这是中共内蒙古自治区委员会4月16日到27日在包头市举行的第六次全体委员扩大会议的中心议题。会议认为，内蒙古自治区工业大跃进是有条件的，关键在于要冲破教条主义、经验主义和右倾保守思想的束缚，把十数万干部和九百万各族人民的积极性拧成一股劲，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行建设。
    出席会议的同志听取了自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫传达的中央和毛主席的重要指示以后，以批评与自我批评的精神，对基本建设程序规定太严，邮电、银行的规章制度订得过死，企业管理中某些不合理的制度都提出了尖锐的批评和改进意见。会议着重分析和批判了“内蒙古落后论”。大家指出对内蒙古的实际情况有两种看法，一种是实事求是的承认在某些方面落后，积极地千方百计地改变落后，这是符合多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游的社会主义建设路线的。这是共产主义思想。另一种到处叫喊困难，向落后低头屈膝，甚至保护落后。这是属于少、慢、差、费、冷冷清清的路线，是非共产主义的思想。落后论者认为内蒙古自治区什么都落后，什么都不好。他们过分强调了内蒙古经济基础落后，自然条件不好，工作没有经验等，因此在工作中老强调客观条件不好，甚至把经济基础和文化落后当成包袱背起来，并拿做工作没有作好的挡箭牌。
    会议还通过具体的事例分析了产生内蒙古落后论的原因、历史上落后的经济基础给了人们以影响，当客观情况起了变化以后，这些人看不见新的事物，思想落后于实际。二、怕困难，向困难低头。三、大汉族主义思想和地方民族主义思想也是产生内蒙古落后论的思想根源之一。有大汉族主义残余的人老感到内蒙古自治区不如内地好；有地方民族主义思想残余的人则往往故步自封，不愿意学先进赶先进。
    会议还批判了教条主义和经验主义。内蒙古自治区地跨三北（东北、华北、西北），干部来自四面八方。好的方面是吸收了各地的先进经验，加速了自治区的建设。不好的是不少同志凭着各地带来的一套经验办事，没有和自治区的实际很好地结合起来。他们靠教条和老经验吃饭，甚至连内蒙古日报也不看。会议认为如果不克服上述不正确的思想，将会妨碍鼓足干劲力争上游多快好省的建设社会主义路线的早日实现。因此，会议认为必须认真学习党中央和毛主席的指示，开展思想解放运动，进一步深入地广泛地宣传内蒙古自治区的建设成就和建设前途。
    会议分析了内蒙古目前工农牧业生产跃进的情况后指出：内蒙古在五年内，耕地面积将达到六百三十三万四千公顷，粮食平均每亩产量将达到四百斤；牲畜达到四千万头。牧区在合作化的基础上实现定居游牧和建立有充足水源的饲料基地，并进行牧场改良工作，也是能够实现的。特别是在五年内，包头钢铁工业基地将提前建成，大兴安岭森林工业基地将扩大建设，赤峰煤田将大规模地开采。这些都要求地方工业必须迅速迎头赶上去。会议认为，只要打破对于工业化的神秘观点，认真执行中央规定的建设方针，在五年内使地方工业的总产值超过现在总产值的十二倍，超过农牧副业的生产总值，并力争在三年内使地方工业的产值赶上农牧业的生产总值是完全可能的。
    会议认为，要加速自治区工业发展速度，必须以现有工业比较多的城市——包头、呼和浩特、海拉尔等作为经济协作区和技术改革的中心，充分利用现有企业，进一步建立协作制度，形成点面结合、城乡结合、大中小企业相结合的工业网。今年必须积极进行勘探设计等工作，积极发展那些规模小、投资少、建设快、收效大，特别是对于改良农具、制造和修配农业机械和中小型工业设备的工厂，以及有色金属、小煤窑、小型冶炼厂、小肥料厂等。对于投资较大、技术较复杂的企业如化肥厂、化工厂、油母页岩炼油厂等，也应当迅速指定专人进行具体准备工作，以便及时动工建厂。会议认为要大办工业，还必须组织大办工业的队伍（包括培养民族职工）。首先把各级党政领导工业的机构马上建立起来，把干部马上配备起来，加速技术人员的训练，争取在五年内培养各种职工二十多万人。办法是老厂帮新厂、大厂帮小厂、国营帮地方、旗县帮乡社，建立协作关系，分片包干，老厂下“蛋”。
