Human Joy Drunk on the East Wind
    ——On Rural Cultural Activities in Xiyang County, Shanxi
    By Our Reporters Shui Tiansheng and Fan Yinhuai

    "Everyone learns culture, everywhere there is singing and dancing." This is a moving depiction of the rural cultural life in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province.

    Seeing is believing. In late April, we went from Taiyuan to Xiyang. Entering Xiyang County, a spring rain had just passed. Farmers were busy with spring plowing and planting; newspapers and books were placed on the edges of the fields along the highway. The walls of villages and streets were decorated with a dazzling array of colorful murals and slogans. A pleasant song floated in the spring breeze. We were captivated by this joyful spring plowing scene.

    We followed a mountain path to the Xiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang Huaiying, the First Secretary of the County Committee, introduced us to the new situation of cultural activities in Xiyang County. Since last winter and this spring, with the arrival of the high tide of agricultural production, mass cultural activities here have become unprecedentedly active. Clubs have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, increasing from 200 last year to 350. Of the 160,000 people in the county, more than 70,000 men, women, and children have participated in cultural activities. In the fields, streets, and homes, everywhere are farmers writing poetry, dancing, singing, and learning culture.

    After the advanced stage of cooperativization, Xiyang farmers have become even more eager for culture. While focusing on production and politics, the County Committee has also taken up culture. Party committees at all levels in Xiyang County attach great importance to rural cultural work. From the County Committee Secretary to the grassroots cadres of townships and communes, all are active participants in rural cultural activities. The directors of rural clubs are all Party branch secretaries or propaganda committee members. The County Committee Secretary and the Minister of Propaganda not only study and lead cultural work, but also write songs and collect materials for the farmers. In carrying out cultural work, the Xiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolutely implemented the principle of being small, diverse, and serving production and politics, strengthening the combat effectiveness and political nature of the Party's leadership over cultural work.

    Today, rich, diverse, and profound cultural activities that are welcomed and loved by the farmers themselves are being carried out everywhere in the rural areas of Xiyang County. Farmers wrote in a clapper talk describing their own cultural life: "Blackboard newspapers, loudspeakers, short plays, spread throughout the village. Reading books and newspapers in the fields, very active inside and outside the department; hanging pictures, displaying cartoons, and watching slides at night; drum lyrics and yangko dances speaking quick boards, performing troupes constantly come to perform. Production and culture advance side by side, happily engaging in production."

    Songs, Qin Sounds, Reading Sounds

    Since the great leap forward in agricultural production, the culture-loving Xiyang farmers continue their cultural activities as usual. Everywhere here are songs, Qin sounds, and reading sounds. At the fields of the Zixin Agricultural Cooperative in Bazhou Village, we visited a wide variety of field cultural activities. On a sandy beach opposite the village, the members were opening up a rice paddy. Conspicuous "mobilization boards" were hung on the construction site, with a limerick written on them, introducing the experience of developing rice paddies in arid areas. When the members sat down to rest, Li Chunyuan, the captain of the Fifth Production Team, sang a limerick he had just written: "Iron shovels and hoes resound to the sky, Cooperativization transforms nature, Dry land can become paddy fields, Water land will become rice paddies..." Then, another member said a segment of clapper talk praising the old farmers Li Mengying and Gao Maoyun for offering ingenious production plans. The members resting in the nearby fields were singing, reading newspapers, or reading books. The field activities ended in about half an hour. The members continued to work with invigorated spirits.

    We participated in a street evening party held in Beiguan Township. This street evening party was very unique, with no stage, no layers of curtains, and no scenery. People simply stood on the village street, hung up a gas lamp and a piece of white cloth - a screen, and the evening party began. During the slide show, the words "Leap Forward Flowers Bloom" were projected on the screen. Then, a production team dedicated its plans and skills to spring plowing and production, and finally completed the spring sowing task very well. An agricultural cooperative member happily said that the slide show praised the production team he was in. At the evening party, four young people beat gongs and drums, using humorous and witty singing and talking to describe the harm of mice and sparrows vividly. This wonderful evening party lasted only a little over an hour. This evening party played a great role in boosting production morale and educating farmers. The Party branch secretary of Beiguan Village led us to visit a newly completed canal. He said, "This canal has a relationship with the Monkey King." We were puzzled. After his explanation, we suddenly understood. It turned out that when the cooperative mobilized its members to repair this canal some time ago, some members lacked confidence because repairing the canal had to pass through a green stone ridge. In response to this situation, the club showed the slide "Flaming Mountain." The scene of the Monkey King defeating the Flaming Mountain infected the members, and someone immediately expressed that they would take out the courage and strength exceeding the Monkey King to split the green stone ridge and build the canal.

    Farmers' Own Poets and Singers

    "Men and women are mobilized, old and young work together; block the water in the sky, dig out the underground spring; make the Dragon King glare angrily, scare the Earth God into trembling." This is a street poem written by a farmer in Xiyang. In Xiyang, many rural streets are filled with street poems. Street poems are very popular among the masses, and people often stop in the streets and read them aloud. Street poems are rich in content and very combative. When farmers feel something in production and life, they immediately write short poems, paste them on the walls, and quickly spread them among the masses.

    Now, there are more than 12,000 active rural art and cultural activists in the county. Shi Zhangyuan, a farmer in Lianyanggou Village, and his family of three generations are all active in cultural activities. He himself can compose clapper talk, write lyrics and compose music, play the erhu, and play the transverse flute. Recently, he wrote two more songs reflecting the great leap forward in agriculture. Such families and such farmers are not individual cases in Xiyang. From last year to the present, farmers have created more than 18,000 literary and artistic works, totaling about 8 million words.

    Socialist Ideological Education and Culture
    The Position of Scientific Education—The Club

    The Xiyang Rural Club has become a position for conducting socialist ideological education to farmers; an important garden for disseminating scientific and technological knowledge and improving the cultural level of the masses. Praising good people and good deeds, and criticizing bad people and bad deeds, has been clearly reflected in the literary and artistic activities of Xiyang farmers. In the Bazhou Village Club, we saw two clay sculptures: one is the image of a rural woman in rags like a beggar; the other is the image of a disgusting, richly dressed landlord. These two clay figures are, one, the mother of Li Runcheng, a farmer in this village before liberation, and the other, the local bully landlord. There is a reason why the farmers shaped these two figures: it turns out that Li Runcheng, a turned-over farmer, said something in the great debate such as "the life of farmers is too hard" and "cooperativization is not free." The club then held an exhibition comparing the old and new societies, displaying these two statues. After seeing these two statues, Li Runcheng remembered the tragic scene of his mother being oppressed and exploited by the landlord before liberation, which gave him a great education. He painfully examined his ungrateful thoughts to the members. Xiyang farmers are also good at using literary and artistic forms to criticize the backward and praise the advanced. When Liuzhuang Village was in urgent need of women to deliver manure during spring plowing and sowing, some women were unwilling to go to work in the fields, saying something like "marrying a man to rely on him is for food and clothing." The club immediately composed a limerick and sang it along the street: "Song Xiaoni in the fourth team, is a model of labor. She gets up early every day, sweeps the streets and cooks, carries manure all day long, and earns eight and a half points. Xiaoni is a hero, some people are soft eggs, relying on men and eating men, thoughts are feudal, all these people, quickly look at Xiaoni." This limerick quickly took effect. The woman Kong Qingyun said: Xiaoni is not simple, she is on the radio and on the blackboard, I want to show my skills and compare with Xiaoni.

    Xiyang farmers have a high enthusiasm for learning cultural, scientific and technological knowledge, and the club is a garden where they often receive cultural, scientific and technological education. Many clubs use physical comparisons, charts, and models to publicize advanced agricultural science and technology and production technology in each period to farmers. We have seen many exhibition activities centered on spring plowing and sowing techniques and new agricultural tools in many rural areas. Beiguan and other townships have recently proposed indicators for a new leap forward in agriculture and water conservancy, and some members lack technology and lack confidence. The club then exhibited comic strips of water conservancy, models of pot-camel machines irrigating the land, and how to build the Zhuanshan Canal. After seeing the exhibition, the members all expressed that they would realize water conservancy before autumn this year. Aiming at the fact that some members are not accustomed to using new agricultural tools, the Bazhou Village Club exhibited more than ten different new and old agricultural tools, and used charts to explain the structure and usage of these agricultural tools. After visiting, the old farmer Li Honglai modified a grain drill suitable for dense planting. Xiyang's rural clubs also often introduce technical books to members, hold technical lectures, and compile various agricultural technology singing materials.

    In Xiyang, we saw many farmers with fountain pens in their upper pockets, and carrying new word cards and books. The enthusiasm of the farmers for learning culture has almost reached the point of forgetting to eat and sleep. They learn wherever they go, and ask wherever they go. On the eve of our farewell to Xiyang County, good news of illiteracy elimination spread to the Bureau of Culture and Education from all directions. Now, Xiyang County has become a "no blind" county for young people, and 86% of the county's young people have been freed from illiteracy.

    人间欢乐醉东风
    ——记山西昔阳县的农村文化活动
    本报记者　水天生　范银怀
    “人人学文化，处处有歌舞”。这是人们对山西省昔阳县农村文化生活的一幅动人的描绘。
    闻名不如见面。4月下旬，我们从太原到昔阳。进入昔阳县界，一场春雨刚过。农民们正忙着春耕点种；公路两旁的地头放着报纸和书本。村落、街头的墙壁上，装饰着琳琅满目的彩色壁画、标语。阵阵春风送来了悦耳的歌声。我们被这幅欢乐的春耕图迷住了。
    我们沿着山坡小道来到中共昔阳县委会。县委第一书记张怀英同志给我们介绍了昔阳县文化活动的新局面。去冬今春以来，随着农业生产高潮的到来，这里的群众文化活动空前活跃。俱乐部如雨后春笋般地建立起来，由去年的二百个增加到三百五十个。全县十六万人中，有男女老幼七万多人参加了文化活动。在田间、街头、家庭，到处是写诗、跳舞、唱歌、学文化的农民。
    高级合作化后，昔阳农民对文化的要求更加迫切，县委在抓生产、抓政治的同时，也抓起了文化。昔阳县各级党委都很重视农村文化工作，从县委书记到乡社基层干部都是农村文化活动的积极参加者。农村俱乐部的主任都是由党支部书记或宣传委员担任。县委书记、宣传部长不仅研究和领导文化工作，而且为农民编写歌曲、搜集材料。沾尚乡党支部宣传委员郭维扣，利用文艺形式开展宣传工作，经常和自己的女儿化装演唱，他的大儿子给他们伴奏。中共昔阳县委在开展文化工作中，坚决贯彻了小型多样，为生产为政治服务的方针，加强了党领导文化工作的战斗性和政治性。
    如今昔阳县农村到处开展着为农民自己喜闻乐见、丰富多采、思想内容深刻的文化活动。农民在描写自己的文化生活的快板中写道：“黑板报，广播筒，小活报，传遍村。地头看书又看报，部内部外很活跃；挂图片，展漫画，晚上还把幻灯看；鼓词秧歌说快板，剧团不断来表演。生产文化齐头进，高高兴兴闹生产。”
    歌声　琴声　读书声
    农业生产大跃进以来，热爱文化的昔阳农民照样进行着文化活动。这里到处是歌声，琴声，读书声。我们在巴洲村自新农业社的地头，参观了一次花样繁多的田间文化活动。在村对面的一片沙滩上，社员们正在开辟一片稻田。工地上悬挂着醒目的“鼓动牌”，上边写着一首顺口溜，介绍了干旱地区开发稻田的经验。社员们坐下来休息时，第五生产队队长李春元给大家演唱了他刚才编写成的顺口溜：“铁锨镢头响连天，合作化改造大自然，旱地能够变水田，水地又要变稻田……。”接着，另一位社员说了一段赞扬老农李孟英、高茂云献出生产妙计的快板。在附近地头休息的社员们，有的在唱歌，有的在读报，有的在看书。田间活动约半小时便结束了。社员们一个个精神振作地继续劳动。
    我们参加了北关乡举行的街头晚会。这个街头晚会很别致，没有舞台，没有层层帐幔，也没有布景，人们只是站在村街，挂起一盏汽灯和一块白布——银幕，晚会就这样开始了。幻灯演出时，银幕上映出了“跃进花儿朵朵开”的字样，接着，一个生产队在春耕生产中献计、献技，最后很好地完成了春播任务。一位农业社社员高兴地说，幻灯表扬的就是他所在的那个生产队。晚会上，四个青年敲锣打鼓，以幽默诙谐的说唱，把老鼠和麻雀的害处，形容得淋漓尽致。这个精采的晚会只用了一个多小时。这个晚会对鼓舞生产情绪，教育农民起了很大的作用。北关村党支部书记领我们参观一条刚完工的水渠，他说：“这条水渠与孙悟空”有关系。我们迷惑了。经他解释我们才恍然大悟。原来前些日子社里发动社员们修这条水渠的时候，有些社员信心不足，因为修水渠必须经过一道青石岭。俱乐部针对这种情况，映出了幻灯“火焰山”，孙悟空战胜火焰山的画面，感染了社员们，当场就有人表示要拿出超过孙悟空的勇气和力量，劈开青石岭，修建水渠。
    农民自己的诗人和歌手
    “男女总动员，老少一齐干；拦住天上水，挖出地下泉；气得龙王干瞪眼，吓的土地打战战。”这是昔阳一个农民写的街头诗。在昔阳，不少农村的街头墙壁上贴满了街头诗。街头诗很受群众欢迎，不时有人驻足街头，大声朗读。街头诗内容丰富，战斗性很强，农民诗人在生产中和生活中有所感触，立即写成短诗，贴在墙壁上，很快传播在群众中。
    现在，全县有一万二千多个农村文艺活动积极分子。里安阳沟村农民史掌元一家三代都是文化活动积极分子，他本人会编快板，会作词谱曲，会拉胡琴，会吹横笛。最近他又写了两首反映农业大跃进的歌曲。像这样的家庭，这样的农民，在昔阳并不是个别的。从去年到目前，农民共创作了一万八千多件文艺作品，约八百多万字。
    社会主义思想教育和文化
    科学教育的阵地——俱乐部
    昔阳农村俱乐部已经成为向农民进行社会主义思想教育的阵地；传播科学技术知识和提高群众文化水平的重要园地。歌颂好人好事，批评坏人坏事，在昔阳农民的文艺活动中得到了鲜明的反映。我们在巴洲村俱乐部里看到两个泥塑：一个是衣衫褴褛形同乞丐的农村妇女的形象；另一个是面目可憎、衣锦肉肥的地主形象。这两个泥塑人像，一个是解放前本村农民李润成的母亲，一个是本村的恶霸地主。农民们塑造这两个人像是有原因的：原来翻身农民李润成在大辩论中说什么“农民生活太苦”，“合作化不自由”，等等。俱乐部便举办了一个新旧社会对比的展览会，展出了这两尊塑像。李润成看了这两尊塑像后，想起了他母亲在解放前受地主压迫剥削的悲惨景象，使他受到极大的教育，他痛苦地向社员们检查了自己的忘本思想。昔阳农民还善于利用文艺形式，批评落后，表扬先进。留庄村在春耕播种时，急需妇女送粪。但有些妇女却不愿上地劳动，说什么“嫁汉靠汉为的是穿衣吃饭”。俱乐部立即编了一首顺口溜沿街说唱：“四队宋小妮，劳动称模范。每天起的早，扫街又做饭，担粪一整天，挣下八分半。小妮是好汉，有些人是软旦，靠汉又吃汉，思想带封建，凡是这些人，快向小妮看。”这个顺口溜很快发生了作用。妇女孔庆云说：小妮不简单，上了广播又上黑板，我要显身手，来和小妮比比看。
    昔阳农民对文化科学技术知识的学习热情很高，俱乐部便是他们经常接受文化科学技术教育的园地。许多俱乐部用实物对比、图表、模型，向农民宣传先进的农业科学技术和每个时期的生产技术。我们在不少农村看到了以春耕下种技术、新式农具等为中心内容的展览活动。北关等乡最近提出了农业、水利再跃进的指标，有些社员缺乏技术，信心不足。俱乐部便展出水利化的连环画、锅驼机浇地和转山渠如何修建的模型。社员们看了展览后，都表示要在今年秋前实现水利化。巴洲村俱乐部针对一些社员不习惯使用新式农具的情况，展出十多种新旧不同的农具，并用图表说明这些农具的构造和使用方法。老农李洪来参观后，改制了一种适用于密植的种谷耧。昔阳的农村俱乐部还经常向社员介绍技术书籍，举办技术讲座，编写各种农业技术的说唱材料。
    在昔阳，我们看到许多农民的上衣口袋里，插着水笔，装着生字卡片和书本。农民们学习文化的劲头几乎达到废寝忘食的地步。他们走到哪里，学到哪里，问到哪里。当我们告别昔阳县的前夕，扫盲捷报从四面八方传到文教局。现在，昔阳县已成为青年“无盲”县，全县86％的青年已摆脱了文盲状态。
