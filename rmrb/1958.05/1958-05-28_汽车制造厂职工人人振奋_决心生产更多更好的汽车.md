Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 27th: The general line for socialist construction proposed by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has greatly inspired the workers and staff of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

These days, the workers of the First Automobile Plant are excited and encouraged that Chairman Mao rode in the "East Wind" sedan they dedicated to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and regard it as the supreme glory and the highest reward from the Party. After the announcement of the closing of the conference, the Party's proposed general line for socialist construction made them even more excited. The workers immediately held discussions, and they unanimously expressed their determination to realize the Party's general line with greater determination. Li Weixin, an old worker in the chassis workshop, said at the discussion that after reading this general line, he felt that the goals were clear and things were easier to handle. The working class will definitely realize the Party's general line. Another old fitter, Sun A'hong, said: "The Party's general line is very comprehensive. With the development of both industry and agriculture, and factories blooming everywhere, socialist construction will be much faster."

In the past few days, the Party and administrative leaders of this factory have been studying measures to produce more and better cars in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, as an important action to implement the general line. Guo Li, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer, told reporters today: "Since the beginning of this year, we have completed the trial production of five types of vehicles ahead of schedule: sedans, dump trucks, gas vehicles, sprinkler trucks, and agricultural dump trucks. According to national regulations, we will only complete the trial production of sedans this year and put them into production next year. Now, according to the leap forward situation of the entire factory and the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, we can produce 100 sedans this year. The output of off-road vehicles, dump trucks, and gas vehicles will be increased compared to the original plan. The original plan to design and trial-produce nine new cars this year has been increased to twelve. Among them, a larger, more advanced sedan than the 'East Wind' brand has already begun to be designed." (Attached picture)

The general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results encourages the workers of Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory. They are resolutely implementing this general line with practical actions. In the past, it took a week for the assembly workshop of this factory to assemble a steam turbine, but on May 27, two units were assembled. This is a steam turbine being assembled by workers.

    汽车制造厂职工人人振奋
    决心生产更多更好的汽车
    新华社长春27日电　中共“八大”第二次会议提出的社会主义建设总路线极大地振奋了第一汽车制造厂的职工。
    这几天，第一汽车厂的职工正在为毛主席乘坐了他们献给“八大”二次会议的“东风”牌小轿车而兴奋鼓舞，并引为无上的光荣和党对他们的最高的奖赏。会议闭幕的消息发表后，党提出的社会主义建设总路线使他们更加激动。职工们立即举行了座谈，他们一致表示要以更大的决心来实现党的这一总路线。底盘车间的老工人李维新在座谈会上说，看了这条总路线后，觉得目标明确，事情更好办了。工人阶级一定能实现党的这一总路线。另一个老钳工孙阿红说：“党的这一总路线很全面。工农业都发展了，工厂遍地开花，社会主义建设就快得多了。”
    这几天，这个厂的党和行政领导干部，都在研究采取措施，以多快好省的精神，生产出更多更好的汽车，作为贯彻总路线的重要行动。副厂长兼总工程师郭力今天对记者说：“今年以来，我们已提前完成了小轿车、翻斗车、煤气车、洒水车和农业翻斗车五种汽车的试制任务。按国家规定，我们今年只完成小轿车的试制任务，明年投入生产。现在根据全厂的跃进形势和‘八大’二次会议的精神，今年就可以生产出一百辆小轿车。越野车、翻斗车、煤气车的产量，都将较原计划有所增加。原计划今年设计和试制的新汽车已经由九种增加到十二种。其中有一种比‘东风’牌更高级的大型轿车，已经开始设计。”（附图片）
    多快好省建设社会主义的总路线鼓舞着上海汽轮机厂工人。他们正以实际行动坚决贯彻这个总路线。这个厂的装配车间过去装配一台汽轮机要一个星期，而5月27日这一天，却装配了两台。这是工人正在装配汽轮机。
