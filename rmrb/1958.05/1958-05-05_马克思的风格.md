Marx shouted the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" and established the scientific foundation for the union of the world's proletariat—scientific communism.

Establishing such a science is no ordinary feat, so the world's proletariat praises Marx as a great revolutionary genius of mankind. But "genius is effort." Only with extraordinary energy and working ability, and tireless dedication to research, can one become a genius. Marx worked tirelessly throughout his life, often forgetting to eat and sleep, so he became a great revolutionary scientist who made a genius contribution to mankind.

To create a revolutionary science, one must first have a scientific attitude oneself. Everything is scientifically demonstrated, and everything seeks a scientific basis. This is Marx's work attitude that is most worthy of our study. Marx and Engels believed that science is the guiding light for the revolutionary struggle of the working people, and the spiritual weapon of the proletariat in its struggle for communism. In the irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeois ideological system, Marx and Engels discovered and developed the science of natural development laws and social development laws. Marx and Engels dedicated their lives to the revolution, were firm and unyielding, and remained consistent for decades, precisely because they had a profound understanding of the laws of historical development and a firm belief in the inevitable arrival of the communist era. This spirit of fortitude and optimism, generated on the basis of scientific faith, is an important style that we should learn from Marx.

Marx had this spirit of fortitude and optimism. From a young age, he was full of vigor and dared to express his opinions. He showed his talent in his doctoral dissertation at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two. At the age of twenty-four, as editor-in-chief of the "Rheinische Zeitung," he boldly attacked the reactionaries and enthusiastically defended the interests of the people. Then he wrote (some in collaboration with Engels) such masterpieces as "The Holy Family," "Theses on Feuerbach," "The German Ideology," and "The Poverty of Philosophy," bravely attacking contemporary philosophical authorities. When he and Engels co-wrote "The Communist Manifesto," which made the entire bourgeois world tremble, he was only twenty-nine years old.

Marx's life was the life of a revolutionary. Neither the persecution of the reactionary governments of various countries at the time, nor the slander of the bourgeois press, nor the deliberate disregard of his works, nor the vicissitudes and poverty in life, could shake him in the slightest from the revolutionary cause.

Daring to act and to do is Marx's consistent style. According to Liebknecht's recollection, Marx always fully expressed his thoughts and feelings without reservation on any occasion. He was not good at faking, and when objective circumstances required him to conceal his emotions, he would appear helpless like a child, and his friends would laugh when they saw it. His wife often called him a big child, also because he was not good at concealing himself, and sometimes blushed completely like a child.

Everyone who came into contact with Marx liked to listen to his knowledgeable, logical, and concise talks. His speeches had great appeal and persuasiveness. In order to convince the other party, he always cited many scientific bases. Any figure or fact he cited was confirmed by the most reliable original materials.

Marx's excellent style lies not only in his ability to meticulously present genuine evidence to convince others, but also in his ability to bravely abandon his own opinions. According to Liebknecht's recollection: "Apart from worshiping the truth, he knew of no other worship. He could abandon his hard-won and cherished theories without hesitation, as long as he confirmed that these theories were wrong."

Marx left us with many examples to learn from. His revolutionary style of forging ahead, studying diligently, always being full of vigor, not fearing any authority, and daring to break with old conventions and create new theories based on scientific evidence; and his scientific style of adhering to his own correct opinions unswervingly and abandoning his own wrong opinions without hesitation, taking truth as the criterion, are even more worthy of our good study.

    马克思的风格
    林陵
    马克思喊出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的口号，并且为全世界无产者联合起来创立了科学的基础——科学的共产主义。
    创立这样的科学不是一件寻常的事情，所以全世界无产阶级都称赞马克思是人类伟大的革命天才。但是“天才就是努力”，只有超乎常人的精力与工作能力，孜孜不倦地钻研，才能成为天才。马克思一生毫不倦怠地工作，往往是废寝忘食地工作，所以他成为给人类做出天才贡献的伟大革命科学家。
    创立革命的科学，首先自己要有科学的态度。一切都经过科学论证，事事寻求科学根据，这是最值得我们学习的马克思的工作态度。马克思和恩格斯认为科学是劳动人民革命斗争的指路明灯，是无产阶级为共产主义进行斗争的精神武器。马克思和恩格斯在同资产阶级思想体系进行不调和的斗争中，发现和发展了自然发展规律和社会发展规律的科学。马克思和恩格斯终生献身于革命，刚强坚毅、从不动摇，数十年如一日，就是由于对历史发展规律有深刻的理解，对共产主义时代必然到来有坚定的信念。这种基于科学的信仰而产生的刚强和乐观精神，是我们应该向马克思学习的重要风格。
    马克思具有这种刚强乐观的精神，从年轻时候起就充满朝气，敢于发表自己的意见，在他二十一二岁所写的博士论文里就初露锋芒，二十四岁主编“莱茵报”就大胆攻击反动派，热烈捍卫人民利益，接着写出（有的是和恩格斯合作的）“神圣的家族”、“费尔巴哈论提纲”、“德意志思想体系”、“哲学的贫困”等巨著，勇敢地进攻当代哲学权威。当他和恩格斯合写使整个资产阶级世界发抖的“共产党宣言”时，还只有二十九岁。
    马克思的一生是革命家的一生。无论是当时各国反动政府的迫害，资产阶级报刊的诽谤或故意对他的著作毫不理睬，无论是生活上的颠沛和贫困，都不能使他对于革命事业有丝毫动摇。
    敢作敢为是马克思的一贯风格。据李卜克内西回忆说，马克思在任何场合总是毫无顾忌地充分表露自己的思想和感情，他不善于作假，在客观情况需要他掩饰感情时，他会像小孩子似的显得手足无措，朋友们看了都要发笑。他的夫人常常把他唤做大孩子，也是因为他不善于掩饰自己，有时面红耳赤地完全像个小孩。
    凡是和马克思接触过的人，都喜欢听他学问渊博、逻辑性很强和言简意赅的谈话。他的讲话有巨大的感染力和说服力，他为了说服对方，总要旁征博引地提出许多科学根据，他所引证的任何一个数字或任何一件事实，都是经过最可靠的原始材料证实的。
    马克思的优良风格不仅在于他能一丝不苟地拿出真凭实据说服别人，还在于他能够勇敢地抛弃自己的意见。据李卜克内西回忆说：“除了崇拜真理之外，他不知道还要崇拜别的，他可以毫不犹疑地抛弃他辛苦得到的他所珍爱的理论，只要他确认这些理论是错误的。”
    马克思给我们留下学习的榜样很多，他那种勇往直前，刻苦钻研，永远充满朝气，不怕任何权威，敢于破除陈规旧说而创立有科学根据的新学说的革命风格，绝不动摇地坚持自己正确意见和毫不犹疑地放弃自己错误意见的以真理为依归的科学风格，更值得我们好好学习。
