Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: According to a Polish Press Agency report: Polish shipyards' production work has been guaranteed due to the agreement signed with the Soviet Union to provide ships.

Currently, the economic recession in the capitalist world is greatly affecting the shipbuilding industry and shipping in the capitalist world, but it has not affected the socialist Poland's shipbuilding industry.

By 1960, ships built by Poland for the Soviet Union will account for 54% of its total shipbuilding volume.

During the period from 1961 to 1965, about half of the ships produced by Polish shipyards will be supplied to the Polish merchant fleet, and the remaining half will mainly be sold to the Soviet Union.

In this way, Poland has fully booked shipbuilding order lists for the next eight years.

The news said that China is also increasingly becoming an important customer of the Polish shipbuilding industry.

    兄弟国家互相支援
    苏联提供长期大量订货  波兰造船业生产获保证
    新华社5日讯　据波兰通讯社报道：由于同苏联签订了提供船只的协定，波兰造船厂的生产工作获得了保证。
    目前，资本主义世界的经济衰退正在很大程度上影响着资本主义世界的造船工业和航运，但它没有影响到社会主义波兰的造船业。
    到1960年为止，波兰为苏联建造的船只将占它的总造船量的54％。
    在1961年到1965年期间，波兰造船厂生产的船只约有一半将供给波兰商船队，其余的一半主要也是售给苏联。
    这样，波兰在今后八年内就有着排得满满的造船订货单。
    消息说，中国也在越来越成为波兰造船业的重要顾主。
