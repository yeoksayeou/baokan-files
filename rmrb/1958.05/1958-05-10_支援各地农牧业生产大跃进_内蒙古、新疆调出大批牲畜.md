    Supporting the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural and Livestock Production Across Regions
    Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Transfer Large Numbers of Livestock
    According to Xinhua News Agency, this year, herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the Inner Mongolian grasslands will support farmers in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces with 250,000 head of strong draft animals, nearly double the total number of draft animals supported to all parts of the country during the First Five-Year Plan period.
    To ensure spring plowing production in various regions, the first batch of more than 25,000 head of draft animals has now been transported to rural areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces. The remaining more than 220,000 head of draft animals will be successively transported from pastoral areas such as Xilin Gol, Ulanqab, Hulunbuir, and Chahar to rural areas in Henan, Anhui, and other provinces in the future.
    This year, herdsmen in the autonomous region are also preparing to support Hebei, Shanxi, and other places with a batch of ewes and camels.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, in order to support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in the interior and the development of animal husbandry production in mountainous areas, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will supply more than 100,400 head of horses, cattle, and sheep to sixteen provinces and autonomous regions, including Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei, Hubei, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. Among these livestock, about 40% are the famous Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, Xinjiang hybrid sheep, and Kuqa breeding rams, and 38,600 are workhorses, breeding stallions, oxen, and dairy cows. At present, some of the livestock have been shipped from pastoral areas such as Ili, Tacheng, and Bortala, and it is expected that all the livestock will be shipped out by the end of the third quarter.
