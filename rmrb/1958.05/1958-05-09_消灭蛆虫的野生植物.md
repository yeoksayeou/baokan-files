    The Anhui Province Eliminate Four Pests Headquarters recently collected eight kinds of wild plants that can kill maggots. These plants have been identified by the Provincial Department of Health's Drug Inspection Institute as having very good maggot-killing effects and do not affect fertility.

    These eight kinds of wild plants are:

    (1) *Qinglehui*, also known as Trumpet Creeper. It contains four kinds of alkaloids, including *qinglehui* alkali, with the stems and leaves containing more alkali. Adding half a catty of dry leaf powder to each dan (approx. 50 kg) of manure can kill maggots.

    (2) *Yangnaohua*, also known as Azalea. The leaves and flowers contain rhododendron toxin, and it can also kill snails and various agricultural pests.

    (3) *Zuiyucao*, also known as Fish Scale or Square Hemp. Its stems and leaves contain alkaloids, and it is used by the people to poison fish.

    (4) *Lilu*, the rhizome contains highly toxic alkaloids.

    (5) *Zeqi*, also known as Cat's Eye or Candelabra Plant, has a very strong maggot-killing power.

    (6) *Mazui Mu*, an evergreen shrub, contains *mazui mu* toxin and can kill maggots and rats. When collecting, prevent the tree sap from coming into contact with the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, eyes, etc., to avoid poisoning.

    (7) *Muli Lu*, a deciduous shrub, the leaves contain veratrine. Adding one catty of leaves to each dan of manure can kill maggots. When collecting, also prevent the tree sap from coming into contact with the mucous membranes of the body.

    (8) *Maliao Cao*, the leaves and flowers are very toxic. Putting it into manure containing maggots and mixing it with the manure can kill 70% of the maggots after two days.

    消灭蛆虫的野生植物
    安徽省除四害总指挥部最近搜集到八种能杀蛆的野生植物。这些植物经省卫生厅药品检验所鉴定，杀蛆效力很好，不影响肥力。
    这八种野生植物是：
    （一）情乐回，又名号筒草，它含有情乐回碱等四种生物碱，茎和叶含碱较多。每担粪中放进半斤干叶粉，就能杀灭蛆虫。
    （二）羊闹花，又名杜鹃花，叶和花含有杜鹃毒素，它还能杀钉螺和农业上的各种害虫。
    （三）醉鱼草，又名鱼鳞子、四方麻，它的茎叶含生物碱，民间用它毒鱼。
    （四）藜芦，根茎含有毒性强烈的生物碱。
    （五）泽漆，又名猫儿眼、灯台草，杀蛆力很强。
    （六）马醉木，常绿灌木，含有马醉木毒素，能杀蛆、杀鼠。采集时要防止树浆接触人体的口、鼻、眼等粘膜部分，以免中毒。
    （七）木藜芦，落叶灌木，叶部含有藜芦素，每担粪便只要放进一斤叶子，就能杀蛆。采集时，也要防止树浆接触人体粘膜部分。
    （八）马蓼草，叶和花毒性很大，把它放进有蛆的粪内，和粪便拌合起来，两天后可杀蛆70％。
