Title: Czechoslovak "Red Rights Daily" Points Out That the Revisionist Views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia Must Be Strictly Criticized; It is Not That Parties of Various Countries Want to Isolate the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, But That the Leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia Exclude Themselves from the International Revolutionary Movement

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th. The "Red Rights Daily" here published a long article on the 8th entitled "The Results of the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," which criticized the revisionist views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The article, in explaining why the Czechoslovak Communist Party did not send a delegation to the congress, said that in estimating the international situation, the relations between socialist countries, the state of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, and in certain questions concerning socialist construction put forward in the draft program, especially certain questions concerning socialist countries, the views held by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia violated Marxist-Leninist principles.

The article said that on many important issues, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia stood outside the ranks of the international communist front. The Communist Parties of all countries have the right to express their views on this matter. The article mentioned a passage from Kadar's speech at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia: the League of Communists of Yugoslavia cannot recognize anyone's right to decide which things in the program are Marxist and which are not. The article said that all Marxists and all communists not only have the right, but also the obligation to express their attitude, especially when the issue in question is the issue of revising Marxism-Leninism.

The article refuted Tito's fallacy of attempting to blame the international tension on "Stalin's stubborn foreign policy." The article wrote that all peace-loving people in the world have been deeply convinced for the forty years since the founding of the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy of peace.

The "Red Rights Daily" article criticized the various anonymous and vague references in the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, such as "certain people" or "individual figures." The article said that this can only be understood from the point of view that Yugoslavia wants to maintain a "special status" between the blocs.

The article emphasized that the congress did not directly condemn the aggressive plans of the ruling groups of American imperialism, especially the aggression plans against world socialism, but instead tried to restore their reputation in the eyes of world public opinion. The "cooperation" between Yugoslavia and the United States was described as an "example": "The basis of our relations with the United States is: mutual respect, equal cooperation and non-interference in internal affairs." The "Red Rights Daily" article asked: Perhaps Yugoslavia, as a socialist country, has better experience in this regard with the United States than many capitalist countries? And the United States is very openly propagating its intention to eliminate the socialist system in Eastern European countries (of course, a very absurd intention).

After criticizing the entire spirit of the discussion on international issues at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the article mentioned that Rankovic complained at the congress that the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries did not first pay attention to the socialist development of their own countries, but instead criticized the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The article pointed out that this is ridiculous. Rankovic does not like the struggle against revisionism. However, all parties that signed the Moscow Declaration and support this declaration believe that their primary task is to fight against the main danger in the current international revolutionary movement - revisionism. They believe that it is their duty to carry out the struggle against revisionism, no matter where revisionism appears, whether it appears in the ranks of their own party or other parties, or in the ranks of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The article also accused the congress of disregarding the extremely rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is of principled significance for the struggle for peace and socialism.

The article said that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia only emphasizes the independence and equality of relations between socialist countries, as if the cooperation and joint action of socialist countries are irreconcilably contradictory to their independence. Socialist countries take the principles of equality and independence for granted, and they also implement these principles in their relations with non-socialist countries. The principle of proletarian internationalism cannot be limited to the principles of equality and independence, and the touchstone of proletarian internationalism is the comprehensive mutual assistance and high ideological unity of socialist countries based on the consistency of their interests and goals. "This belief prevents the Communist Parties of various countries from estimating the socialist construction issues of their own countries in isolation or regardless of other brotherly countries."

"It can also be noted that the congress adopted a negative attitude in estimating the cooperation between the Communist Parties of various countries. Objective analysis is replaced by subjective distortion."

The article pointed out that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the speeches at the congress all glossed over the great significance of the Moscow Conference held during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and even did not mention the peace declaration signed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia itself.

The "Red Rights Daily" article pointed out that some people complained at the congress and insisted that the Communist Parties of various countries wanted to "isolate" the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In fact, it is the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that is isolating themselves and "voluntarily placing themselves outside the united struggle and efforts of the international revolutionary movement."

The article also pointed out that on the issues of the world political situation, the experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and their mutual relations, and the common cooperation of the Communist Parties, the position of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has essential differences with the position of the Communist Parties of various countries, and has deep contradictions with the documents of the Moscow Conference. This is not, and cannot be, a non-essential difference of opinion, nor is it merely a difference in how to understand the forms and methods of the struggle for peace and socialism. The article emphasized: "This is indisputably a violation of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

The article said that opportunistically distorting the nature of modern capitalism and advocating the spontaneous generation of socialism, negating the Leninist teachings on the role of the state and the party, etc., are all non-Marxist theories, and all of this constitutes a complete ideological system, which has essential differences with Marxist-Leninist thought and is absolutely incompatible with Marxism-Leninism, because they distort Marxism-Leninism with revisionist views. The article then said that no one can say anything about interfering in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia or its party, because Marxism-Leninism has international universal significance, and remaining silent about distorting Marxism-Leninism means weakening the combat effectiveness of our movement and endangering its unity. The article said that the editorial of the Chinese "People's Daily" on May 5 very correctly pointed out these issues and other issues.

The "Red Rights Daily" article concluded by saying that the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people welcomed the normalization of relations with Yugoslavia in the past, and have also taken many steps to develop the relations between the two parties for each other's benefit and for the benefit of the entire communist movement. However, the relations between the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia can only be developed on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. "The results of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia show that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia intends to continue to invariably take a 'their own' path different from the path of Marxism-Leninism."

### 捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”指出  南共修正主义观点必须严格批判  并非各国党想要孤立南共，而是南共领导人自外于国际革命运动

    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”指出
    南共修正主义观点必须严格批判
    并非各国党想要孤立南共，而是南共领导人自外于国际革命运动
    新华社布拉格8日电　这里的“红色权利报”8日刊载了一篇题为“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会的结果”的长篇文章，对南共的修正主义观点作了批判。
    这篇文章在解释捷克斯洛伐克共产党为什么没有派代表团参加这次代表大会时说，在估计国际形势、社会主义国家的关系、国际共产主义运动和工人阶级运动的状况方面，以及在纲领草案中所提出的关于社会主义建设的某些问题、特别是社会主义国家的某些问题上，南共所持的看法违背了马克思列宁主义原则。
    文章说，在许多重要问题上，南共是站在国际共产主义阵线行列之外的。各国共产党有权利对这件事表示他们的观点。文章提到了卡德尔在南共代表大会上说的一段话：南共不能承认任何人有权决定纲领中哪些东西是马克思主义的，哪些不是。文章说，一切马克思主义者和一切共产党不仅有权利、而且也有义务表示态度，尤其是当引起争执的问题是修正马克思列宁主义的问题的时候。
    文章驳斥了铁托企图把国际紧张局势归罪于“斯大林的顽固的外交政策”的谬论。文章写道，全世界所有爱好和平的人民在苏联成立的四十年来都深信苏联是在奉行和平政策。
    “红色权利报”的文章指责南共代表大会上各种匿名的、含糊的提法，如“某些人”或“个别人物”。文章说，这只能从这样的观点来理解，那就是南斯拉夫想要在集团之间保持“特殊地位”。
    文章着重指出，代表大会并没有直接谴责美帝国主义统治集团的侵略计划、首先是针对世界社会主义的侵略计划，相反却力图在世界公众的眼中挽回他们的声望。南斯拉夫和美国之间的“合作”被说成是“范例”：“我们同美国关系的基础是：互相尊重、平等合作和互不干涉内政。”“红色权利报”的文章问道：也许南斯拉夫、作为一个社会主义国家，同美国在这方面有着比许多资本主义国家还更好的经验吗？而美国却是十分公开地宣传它要消灭东欧国家的社会主义制度的意图（当然是十分荒谬的意图）的。
    在对南共代表大会关于国际问题的讨论中的整个精神作了批判以后，文章谈到，兰科维奇在代表大会上曾经埋怨社会主义国家的共产党和工人党不首先注意自己国家的社会主义发展而却批评南共的纲领草案。文章指出，这是荒谬可笑的。兰科维奇不喜欢反对修正主义的斗争。然而，所有签署莫斯科宣言和支持这个宣言的党都认为它们的首要任务是对当前国际革命运动中的主要危险——修正主义——进行斗争。它们认为进行反对修正主义的斗争是它们的义务，不管修正主义在什么地方出现，不论是在它们自己的党或其他党的队伍中出现，在南共队伍中出现也是一样。文章还指责代表大会漠视对争取和平和社会主义的斗争具有原则意义的苏联共产党的极其丰富的经验。
    文章说，南共只是强调社会主义国家关系上的独立和平等，就好像社会主义国家的合作和联合行动同它们的独立有着不可调和的矛盾似的。社会主义国家认为平等和独立的原则是理所当然的，它们在对非社会主义国家的关系上也在执行这种原则。无产阶级国际主义的原则并不能限于平等和独立的原则，而无产阶级国际主义的试金石则是社会主义国家从它们的利益和目的一致出发的全面互助和高度的思想上的一致。“这种信念使各国共产党不能孤立地或者不顾其他兄弟国家而‘独立地’估计它本国的社会主义建设问题。”
    “也可以注意到代表大会在估计各国共产党之间的合作时所采的否定态度。客观的分析为主观主义的歪曲所代替。”
    文章指出，南共纲领草案以及代表大会中的发言都对在庆祝十月革命四十周年时举行的莫斯科会议的伟大意义略而不谈，甚至连南共自己参加签署的和平宣言也没有提到。
    “红色权利报”的文章指出，在代表大会上有人抱怨、硬说各国共产党想要“孤立”南共。事实上是南共在孤立他们自己和“自愿把他们自己置身于国际革命运动的统一斗争和努力之外”。
    这篇文章还指出，在世界政治局势、苏联和其他社会主义国家的经验及它们的相互关系、以及共产主义政党共同合作的问题上，南共领导人的立场同各国共产党的立场有本质上的分歧，并且同莫斯科会议的文件有深刻的矛盾。这不是、而且也不可能是一个非本质的观点分歧问题，也不仅是对争取和平和社会主义的斗争形式和方法如何理解的分歧问题。文章强调说：“这是无可争辩地违背了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则的问题。”
    文章说，机会主义地歪曲了现代资本主义的性质并提倡自发地产生社会主义，否定关于国家和关于党的作用的列宁主义教导等等，这些都是非马克思主义的理论，所有这一切构成了一个完整的观念体系，它们同马克思列宁主义思想有着本质上的分歧并且是同马克思列宁主义绝对不相容的，因为它们用修正主义的观点歪曲了马克思列宁主义。文章接着说，谁也不能说什么干涉南斯拉夫或它的党的内部事务，因为马克思列宁主义具有国际普遍意义，而对歪曲马克思列宁主义不作声就意味着削弱我们的运动的战斗力、危害它的团结。文章说，中国“人民日报”5月5日的社论非常正确地指出了这些问题和其他问题。
    “红色权利报”的文章最后说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民过去欢迎同南斯拉夫的关系的正常化，并且也已经采取了许多步骤来使两党的关系为着彼此有利和有利于整个共产主义运动而发展。然而捷共和南共间的关系只有在马克思列宁主义的基础上才能得到发展。“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的结果表明，南共打算继续不变地采取同马克思列宁主义道路不同的另外一条‘他们的’道路。”
