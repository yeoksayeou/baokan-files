Xinhua News Agency, 15th - The southern early rice is currently a sea of green. Most of the seedlings are growing luxuriantly and strongly, and many areas have seen unprecedented good harvests. All regions are vigorously carrying out field management, seizing the time for inter-tilling and topdressing, and making a concentrated effort to deal with third-class seedlings, striving for a bumper harvest.

This year, all regions have carried out large-scale changes from middle rice to early rice, from intercropping to continuous cropping, and from dry land to paddy fields, greatly expanding the planting area of ​​early rice. Hubei's early rice area has more than doubled compared to last year, Sichuan has expanded by more than 60%, and Jiangxi has planted more than 24.3 million mu, an increase of 47% over last year.

This year's early rice in all regions generally has more water, sufficient base fertilizer, early planting, and dense planting. Most areas have planted ten to twenty days earlier than in previous years. More than 45 million mu of early rice in Guangdong and Sichuan were planted by the end of April. In the Pearl River Delta plain, which has historically been late in planting and harvesting, no seedlings had been planted by the Qingming Festival in previous years, but this year most of it was planted by the Qingming Festival. Hunan broke the traditional "Qingming soaking seeds, Guyu sowing mud, Lixia transplanting" custom and roughly planted more than 20 million mu of early rice by the end of April. In the past, Hunan generally planted less than 10,000 seedlings per mu, but this year most of them planted 20,000 to 40,000 seedlings per mu; in the past, they generally cultivated shallowly at about three inches, but this year they cultivated deeply to four or five inches; the base fertilizer was also increased four to five times compared to last year.

Sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, early planting, and dense planting are only the beginning of high-yield measures. To ensure a bumper harvest, it is necessary to carry out more complex struggles in the longer field management stage. In addition, this year's widespread dense planting and early row closure of seedlings make it extremely easy for diseases and insect pests to spread, so all regions are paying special attention to field management. Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Jiangxi and other places are strengthening field management through field inspections and evaluations, discovering problems, and organizing discussions. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also put forward the battle cry of "implementing technical measures 100% and thoroughly passing the field management barrier" to the entire province.

The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have entered the plum rain season, which poses a greater threat to rice growth. Some areas of Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces are fighting against the plum rain, vigorously clearing ditches and draining waterlogging, and replanting.

Guangxi, Yunnan and other places have suffered from severe drought this spring, and most of the early rice was planted against the drought. Now farmers of all ethnic groups are trying every means to strengthen the management of rice fields.

### 水多、肥足、早插、密插  南方早稻一片翠绿

　　水多、肥足、早插、密插
    南方早稻一片翠绿
    新华社15日讯　南方早稻目前已是一片翠绿。大多数禾苗生长繁茂、壮旺，许多地区出现了从未有过的好禾。各地正在大力进行田间管理，抓紧中耕、追肥，突击处理三类禾苗，争取大丰收。
    今年各地大规模地进行了中稻改早稻，间作改连作，旱田改水田，大大扩大了早稻种植面积。湖北早稻面积比去年扩大了一倍以上，四川扩大了60％以上，江西已插下的二千四百三十多万亩比去年增加了47％。
    今年各地早稻一般是水量多，底肥足，插的早，插的密。大部分地区都比往年早插了十天到二十天。广东、四川的四千五百多万亩早稻，早在4月下旬就已插完。历来迟播晚收的珠江三角洲平原，往年清明还没有插上一棵禾，今年清明却已大部插完。湖南打破了历来流行的“清明浸种、谷雨下泥、立夏插秧”的陈规，4月底就把两千多万亩早稻大体插完。湖南过去一般每亩插秧不到一万蔸，今年每亩大多插到两万到四万蔸；过去一般都是浅耕三寸左右，今年深耕到四、五寸；底肥也比去年增加了四倍到五倍。
    水足、肥丰、插早、插密仅仅是丰产措施的开始，要确保丰收，还要在较长的田间管理阶段进行更复杂的斗争。加以今年普遍密植，禾苗封行早，病虫害极易蔓延，所以各地都特别抓紧田间管理工作。湖北、湖南、四川、广东、江西等地正通过田间检查评比，发现问题，组织讨论，加强了田间管理。最近，中共广东省委还向全省提出了“百分之百地执行技术措施，彻底过好田间管理关”的战斗口号。
    长江中下游地区已进入低温多雨的霉雨季节，对于水稻生长威胁较大。浙江、湖南、湖北等部分地区正在同霉雨作斗争，大力进行清沟排渍和补种重插工作。
    广西、云南等地今春旱情较重，大多数早稻都是抗旱抢插的，现在各族农民正在千方百计地加强稻田管理工作。
