    Where Does "Demeanor" Come From?
    Mu Zhi
    At the anti-waste exhibition of the Ministry of Railways, two intact garments were on display. One was a blue serge uniform worth 18 yuan, and the other was a gray paletot uniform worth more than 70 yuan. Both garments were worn by the actor playing Hua Yun in the railway cultural troupe's play "Sharing Sweetness and Bitterness." The difference was that the one worth more than 70 yuan was newly made after March of last year.
    Why did Hua Yun have to change clothes?
    It turned out that in March of last year, when the actor playing Hua Yun appeared on stage wearing the blue uniform, some audience members commented that Hua Yun was a division-level cadre, but the actor's demeanor did not convey that adequately. A few days later, the actor asked the leadership to approve the making of the gray uniform costing more than 70 yuan. It was said that the expensive clothes would allow her to better express the demeanor of a division-level cadre. However, the expensive clothing did not help her portray the role, and she eventually returned to wearing the original garment.
    The demeanor of a character in a play is the concentrated expression of how the actor understands the character's thoughts and feelings. This actor, upon hearing criticism, did not consider the problem from the perspective of her own creation of the role, but instead pursued the character's clothing, which is simply putting the cart before the horse. In her view, the clothing of leading cadres who come from the masses should be directly proportional to their position. The higher the position, the more expensive the clothing should be. No wonder she still failed to express the demeanor of a leading cadre even after putting on expensive clothing.

    “风度”哪里来？
    穆志
    在铁道部反浪费展览会上，展出了两件完好的衣服。一件是价值十八元的蓝色青年呢制服，另一件是价值七十多元的灰色派力斯制服。这两件衣服，都是铁路文工团在话剧“同甘共苦”中，让饰演华云的演员穿的。不同的是，七十多元的那一件是去年3月以后新做的。
    为什么华云非要换衣服呢？
    原来，在去年3月，饰演华云的演员穿着那件蓝制服出现在舞台上的时候，有的观众反映说，华云是处级干部，但是演员的风度表现的不够。过了几天，这位演员就请领导上批准她做了那身七十多元的灰制服。据说，贵重的衣服能让她更好地表现处级干部的风度。但，高贵的服装，并没帮助她表现角色，以后她还是穿上了原来的服装。
    剧中人的风度，是演员怎样体会角色的思想、感情的集中表现。这位演员听到批评，不从自己对角色的创造上去考虑问题，反而去追求角色的衣饰，这简直是本末倒置。在她看来，来自群众的领导干部，衣饰应该同职位成正比。职位越高，衣饰就应该更高贵。这就难怪她在穿上高贵的外衣后，依旧表现不好领导干部的风度了。
