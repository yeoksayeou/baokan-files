    Dunhuang Has Water Sources
    (Our report) Dunhuang County has large tracts of fertile land, but it cannot be developed due to scarce rainfall.
    In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire county formed a water source survey team and went deep into the snow mountains. They first surveyed Yanchiwan and Shuixiakou in the upper reaches of the Dang River. It was confirmed that the annual water volume in the upper reaches of the Dang River is about 700 million cubic meters, all of which are collected in Yanchiwan, forming a large 800-square-kilometer grass lake evaporation area. After the undercurrent converges at Shuixiakou downstream, the water volume has been greatly reduced. According to preliminary calculations, 500 to 600 million cubic meters of water can be diverted. Another water source is Hala Lake, located in the upper reaches of the Dang River. It is a large basin in the mountains, and about 300 million cubic meters of snow water can be diverted to the Dang River.
    The total amount of Qilian Mountains water source that Dunhuang can utilize is about 1.3 billion cubic meters, plus 100 million cubic meters of Nanhu spring water and the widespread groundwater. If it can be economically utilized, 5 million mu of land can be developed. (Duan Zijing)

    敦煌有了水源
    本报讯　敦煌县有大片肥沃土地，因为雨量稀少而不能开发。
    1958年全县人民在党的领导下，组成水源查勘队，深入雪山，首先查勘了党河上游的盐池湾、水峡口等地，证实了党河上游年水量约有七亿立公方左右，均汇集于盐池湾，形成八百平方公里的大面积草湖蒸发区。潜流在下游水峡口汇集后，水量已大大减少。根据初步计算，可引用五亿到六亿公方的水量。另一个水源是哈拉湖，位于党河上游，是山中一个大盆地，可以引到党河的雪水约三亿立公方。
    以上总计敦煌可以利用的祁连山水源约在十三亿立公方左右，加上南湖泉水一亿立公方和普遍存在的地下水，如能经济利用后，即可开发土地五百万亩。（段子敬）
