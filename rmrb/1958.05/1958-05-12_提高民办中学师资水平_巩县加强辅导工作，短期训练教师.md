　　Improving the Quality of Teachers in Private Middle Schools
    Gong County Strengthens Guidance Work, Short-Term Training for Teachers
    (Our reporter Chen Jian) Henan Province's Gong County's newly established 74 private middle schools are gradually resolving some pressing issues encountered after their establishment. These issues mainly include improving the quality of teachers, appropriately arranging the balance of study, labor, and rest, and achieving self-sufficiency.
    These private middle schools were established in the context of the Great Leap Forward in culture. There are nearly 10,000 students, including all the county's graduates from higher and elementary schools over the years, 50% of whom are township and commune cadres who are not detached from production. Most of the teachers are students who graduated from junior high school. In the early stages of establishing the schools, many commune cadres were afraid of affecting the work and production of the commune, students and parents did not believe that junior high school graduates could teach junior high school, and in particular, teachers and students could not reasonably arrange study and production. This made the schools appear chaotic for a time, and some students who had registered did not go to school. Gong County first grasped the key link of improving the quality of teachers. They established a guidance network system throughout the county. The county, with nine public middle schools as the center, established nine guidance groups, which were led by the principals or teaching directors of the respective public middle schools. All private middle schools established fixed relationships with the various guidance groups based on the region. The nine guidance groups regularly convened guidance meetings in each guidance area according to different situations, and specifically helped the teachers of private middle schools prepare lessons. The guidance group of Gong County No. 1 Middle School also explained the first-grade literature textbook lesson by lesson, section by section, and printed it into an mimeographed booklet, which was distributed to the language teachers of various private middle schools for reference, and the effect was very good. Most of the guidance groups also established a mobile guidance system, where counselors would go to the private schools to listen to the teachers' lectures and provide specific assistance to the teachers of the private schools at any time. The guidance groups also organized the teachers of the private schools to visit and learn from the private schools with good lectures. Each private middle school also established teaching and research groups and established a system of professional and political study. Many teachers of private middle schools also participated in the "Red and Expert" school in the township for study. Recently, the county also established an intermediate normal school to train a batch of teachers for private middle schools in the short term. Now, a small number of students who had registered and dropped out have returned to school.
    Regarding the arrangement of study, labor, and rest time, most private middle schools have adopted the new every-other-day school system. A large amount of material proves that students attend classes one day and labor the next, which not only reduces the excessive fatigue caused by concentrated labor, but also solves the contradiction between study and work for half of the students; it also solves the contradiction that commune cadres are afraid that concentrated classes will affect production too much. When stipulating class hours, all private middle schools fully considered the characteristics of students living scattered, and the class starting time in the morning was after 8:30. In order to take care of more than half of the students who bear social work and have less time to review, most schools set aside a class every afternoon for review, which is very popular among students.
    All private middle schools that adopt the every-other-day system have students collectively carry out voluntary labor on Sundays, and the proceeds are uniformly allocated by the school. Generally, 20% is used for students' pens, ink, paper, and other expenses; 20% is controlled by the class to order newspapers and magazines; and 60% is used for school administrative expenses and teachers' salaries. The income from voluntary labor of the seventy-four private middle schools in the county can all achieve self-sufficiency. Recently, all schools have successively held end-of-month tests, and the scores of 80% of the students in each subject are between 70 and 80 points. The masses praised this kind of middle school as "perfect in all aspects" and "satisfactory to the state, agricultural cooperatives, parents, and students."

### 提高民办中学师资水平  巩县加强辅导工作，短期训练教师

　　提高民办中学师资水平
    巩县加强辅导工作，短期训练教师
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省巩县新开办的七十四所民办中学，正在逐步解决建校后所遇到的一些迫切问题，这些问题主要是：提高师资水平；学习、劳动和休息三者的适当安排，以及自供自给等问题。
    这些民办中学是在文化大跃进的形势下建立起来的。学生近万人，包括全县历年来的高、初小学毕业生，其中50％是不脱离生产的乡、社干部。教员多数是初中毕业的学生。建校初期，很多社干部怕影响社里的工作和生产；学生和家长不相信初中毕业生能教初中；特别是教员和学生不能合理安排学习和生产。使学校一度表现较乱，有些报了名的学生不去上学了。巩县首先抓住提高师资水平这一关键环节。他们在全县建立了辅导网制度；全县以九个公立中学为中心，成立九个辅导组，辅导组都由各公立中学的校长或教导主任领导。所有民办中学分地区和各个辅导组建立固定的关系。九个辅导组根据不同情况定期召开各辅导区的辅导会议，具体帮助民办中学的教员备课。巩县第一中学的辅导组还把一年级的文学课本，逐课逐节加以解释，并印成油印小册子，发给各民办中学的语文教员作参考，效果很好。大部分辅导组还建立了巡回辅导制度，辅导员到民校听教员讲课，随时给民校教员具体帮助。辅导组还组织民校教员到讲课好的民校去参观、学习。各民办中学也成立教研组，建立了业务、政治学习制度。不少民办中学的教员还参加乡里的“红专”学校学习。最近，该县还成立了一所中级师范学校，短期为民办中学训练一批教员。现在，少数报了名又退学的学生又入学了。
    关于学习、劳动和休息的时间安排问题，多数民办中学采取了隔日制新学制。大量的材料证明，学生一天上课，一天劳动，不仅减少集中劳动所引起的过度疲劳，也解决了半数学生的学习和工作的矛盾；解决了社干部怕集中上课过多影响生产的矛盾。各个民办中学在规定上课时间时，都充分的注意到学生居住分散的特点，上午上课时间都在八点半以后。为了照顾半数以上的学生负担社会工作，复习时间较少，大部分学校每天下午都抽出一节课作复习，很受学生们的欢迎。
    凡是采取隔日制的民办中学，星期日学生集体进行义务劳动，收益由学校统一支配，一般是20％作为学生的笔墨纸张费用；20％归班级掌握订购报纸杂志；60％作为学校行政开支和教员工资。全县七十四个民办中学利用义务劳动的收益，可以全部达到自供自给。最近各校都先后举行过月终测验，有80％的学生各科成绩在七十分和八十分之间。群众称赞这样的中学“四全其美”“国家、农业社、家长、学生均满意”。
