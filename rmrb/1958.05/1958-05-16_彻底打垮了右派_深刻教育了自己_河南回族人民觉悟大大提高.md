Thoroughly Defeated the Rightists, Profoundly Educated Themselves: The Awareness of the Hui People in Henan Has Greatly Increased

(Our Correspondent Fang Huang reports) Since Henan Province launched the anti-Rightist struggle among the upper-level figures of the Hui ethnic group and Islamic circles, it has achieved great victories. After more than five months of struggle, the Hui masses in various parts of the province have exposed a group of Rightists, including Xie Xisan, Mai Mingdao, Bai Qingzhang, and Wan Jinrong. These Rightists have consistently used the banner of ethnicity and the cloak of religion, appearing under the hypocritical guise of safeguarding ethnic interests, to carry out the heinous activities of opposing the Party, opposing the people, opposing socialism, and undermining ethnic unity.

During the period of great blooming and contending last year, when Rightists in various parts of Henan frantically attacked the Party, Rightists hidden among the upper-level figures of the Hui ethnic group and Islamic circles took the opportunity to spread reactionary remarks inciting ethnic division and slandering the Party's ethnic policies. Some Rightists even conspired to organize riots, attempting to establish independent kingdoms and undermine national unity. According to the masses' exposure, the reactionary remarks of these Rightists are mainly manifested in four aspects: First, they incited ethnic relations, slandered the Party's ethnic policies, and obliterated the achievements of the Party's ethnic work over the past few years. They also created various disputes to provoke relations between the Hui and Han ethnic groups, and vigorously promoted reactionary fallacies such as "Hui people all over the world are one family" and "Compete for religion, not for country."

Second, these Rightists consistently opposed the socialist system, hated the new society, and depicted the current society as a scene of utter darkness, saying that before liberation there were "few poor people and many rich people," while after liberation there were "many poor people and few rich people," slandering the socialist system as a "starvation system," and saying that "the more and larger the cooperatives, the narrower the road for the Hui people." They undermined the country's policies and laws, slaughtered farming cattle privately on a large scale, and obtained cooking oil and grain through deceptive purchasing. Rightist Bai Qingzhang shouted last year in the second half of the year that the policy of unified purchase and sale was starving people, but on the other hand, he sold more than a thousand catties of surplus grain at high prices on the black market, disrupting the country's grain market. During the Corban Festival last year, Rightist Mai Mingdao slaughtered more than ten head of cattle, and also slandered the government for discriminating against ethnic minorities and not respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, even restricting the slaughter of cattle.

Third, they hated Hui cadres and Party and League members, and insulted activists. They scolded Hui cadres as "Dusiman" (i.e., enemies) and "Hui traitors," and said that progressive Ahongs were "people without religion." Rightist Xie Xisan openly cursed Party and League members while lecturing, and prevented his Helifan (students) from joining the Communist Youth League, saying, "Joining the League means becoming Iblis (devil)."

Fourth, a large number of facts exposed by the masses prove that these Rightists, in order to realize their personal political ambitions, were also carrying out various counter-revolutionary actions to undermine the unification of the motherland, organizing anti-Party and anti-socialist groups. Rightist Bai Qingzhang had twice incited Hui riots in 1953, causing losses to the masses. The government gave him leniency, but Bai Qingzhang still did not repent. During the period of great blooming and contending, he slandered the Party's ethnic policies everywhere, attempting to incite trouble again among the Hui people. Yuan Changxiu, an Ahong and Rightist in Ningling County, incited Hui people to fight the Communist Party, and even frantically instigated Hui people to first attack their own villages and communities, then attack the county seat, and finally establish an Islamic kingdom. The Hui people in Nanyang Prefecture exposed the counter-revolutionary crimes of Wan Jinrong, an Ahong in Fangcheng County. Wan Jinrong participated in counter-revolutionary activities as early as 1948. After liberation, he received lenient treatment from the government, but he still did not repent, gathered a group of counter-revolutionaries, and prepared to riot. He also attempted to incite riots among the Hui people in Xi'an, saying that the main thing was to plant the green flag in Xi'an, and he also prepared to kill all the Ahongs who did not agree with his riot. Mai Yongxin and Li Jinkai, Ahongs and Rightists in Taikang County, organized a counter-revolutionary group, proclaiming themselves as king, premier, chief of staff, and minister of foreign affairs, and conspired to riot.

After the Rightists hidden among the ethnic minorities and wearing the cloak of ethnicity and religion were exposed, it aroused the anger of the Hui people and the heads of Islamic circles, Ahongs, and Helifan throughout the province. In January, the Ethnic Affairs Committee of Henan Province convened the fourth enlarged meeting of the province, and more than 100 Ahongs, heads of Islamic circles, and Helifan who attended the meeting focused on criticizing and exposing Rightists such as Xie Xisan, Bai Qingzhang, and Mai Mingdao. The Hui masses in various prefectures, counties (cities) in the province also actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle. At the anti-Rightist struggle rallies held in various places, everyone sternly refuted the reactionary fallacies of the Rightists who slandered the Party and slandered the new society with their own experiences and the comparison between the old and new societies. Many Hui people in Zhengzhou City shed tears at the meeting to expose Xie Xisan when they accused the Kuomintang of the cruel oppression and exploitation they suffered before liberation. When the Hui people in Taikang County refuted the lies of Rightists such as Mai Yongxin who slandered that "the lives of Hui people have become more and more bitter after liberation," they cited the example of the South Gate Town in the urban area of the county. Before liberation, the Hui people in South Gate, Taikang County, lived a very difficult life. There were 37 households begging for food, and five households starved to death during the great famine in 1943. At that time, there were only four literate Hui people in the entire South Gate. After liberation, the Hui people in South Gate were given 544 mu of land and 38 head of livestock, and their lives were very prosperous. There were also more than 140 Hui children attending middle and primary schools. At the meeting, the masses questioned the Rightists: Is this not an improvement in the lives of the Hui people? Zhu Xianzhen, who had been rumored by Rightist Ma Jinxing to have a swollen face from starvation, also rushed to the meeting to expose the Rightists. He said angrily: "I eat very well all year round, and my face is white and plump. Why do the Rightists want to use me to attack the Party?" At the meeting to expose Rightist Bai Qingzhang, many Hui people in Shangqiu Prefecture accused Bai Qingzhang of the losses he brought to the Hui people in creating ethnic disputes. Many people wanted to settle accounts with Bai Qingzhang and ask him to compensate for the losses. Through reasoning and struggle, the Hui masses and upper-level figures in various places also criticized the local nationalism and pan-Islamism promoted by the Rightists. The Hui people in Shangqiu Prefecture refuted the fallacies of "competing for religion, not for country," "Hui people all over the world are one family," and "Hui ethnicity is Islam" promoted by the Rightists with a large number of facts, and pointed out that the purpose of the Rightists in spreading these fallacies was to blur the Hui people's patriotic concepts, class concepts, and concepts of the enemy and ourselves, so that they could continue to carry out their reactionary rule over the Hui people.

Through the anti-Rightist struggle and in-depth criticism of local nationalism, the Rightists have been isolated among the Hui people, and the socialist awareness of the broad masses of Hui people has also been greatly improved. A new scene has emerged in the Hui ethnic group and Islamic circles throughout the province. A self-transformation movement has been universally launched among the upper-level figures in ethnic and religious circles. A high tide of comparison and competition has formed throughout the province, with everyone formulating plans and everyone wanting to transform themselves. On the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle in Kaifeng City, the Ahongs, heads of Islamic circles, and Helifan in the city have all formulated great leap forward plans and advocated competition among the Ahongs in the Islamic circles of the whole country and the whole province. In the past, Ahongs never participated in production and relied on the support of the Hui people, but after the anti-Rightist struggle and socialist education, they all voluntarily requested to participate in production. All the Ahongs in Kaifeng City are determined to be self-reliant and participate in production within two years. In order to express their determination, they also voluntarily invested more than 1,000 yuan to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and happily reported the good news to the Party committee with gongs and drums. Ma Yuxiang, an Ahong in Ningling County, guaranteed that two laborers in his family would participate in production and complete 200 to 300 labor days this year. The ethnic relations have also been unprecedentedly harmonious. In some places, the "knots" between the Hui and Han people for many years have been resolved, and the ethnic joint cooperatives have been further consolidated. The phenomenon of private slaughter of farming cattle and panic buying by the Hui people has also been greatly reduced. A new ethos of labor production, diligence and thrift, patriotism and law-abiding has been established everywhere among the Hui people.

　　彻底打垮了右派　深刻教育了自己
    河南回族人民觉悟大大提高
    本报讯　记者方徨报道：河南省在回族和伊斯兰教界上层人士中开展反右派斗争以来，已经取得了巨大胜利。经过五个多月来的斗争，全省各地的回族群众揭发了谢锡三、买明道、白清章、宛金荣等一批右派分子。这些右派分子一贯打着民族招牌，披着宗教外衣，以维护民族利益的伪善面貌出现，进行反党、反人民、反社会主义和破坏民族团结的罪恶活动。
    在去年大鸣大放期间，当河南各地的右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，隐藏在回族和伊斯兰教界上层人士中的右派分子，更乘机活动，散布挑拨民族团结、诬蔑党的民族政策的反动言论。有的右派分子还阴谋组织暴动，企图搞独立王国，破坏国家的统一。根据群众揭发的，这些右派分子的反动言论主要表现在四个方面：首先，他们挑拨民族关系，诬蔑党的民族政策，抹煞几年来党的民族工作的成绩。他们还制造各种纠纷，挑拨回、汉族的关系。竭力宣传什么“天下回民是一家”、“争教不争国”等反动谬论。
    第二，这些右派分子一贯的反对社会主义制度，仇恨新社会，把现在的社会描绘得一团漆黑，说解放前是“穷人少、富人多”，解放后是“穷人多、富人少”，诬蔑社会主义制度是“挨饿制度”，说什么“合作社越多越大，回民的路就越窄”，他们破坏国家的政策法令，大肆私宰耕牛，套购食油和粮食。右派分子白清章在去年下半年一面叫喊统购统销政策饿死人，一面却把一千多斤余粮在黑市高价出售，扰乱国家的粮食市场。右派分子买明道去年宰牲节时，他宰了十多头牛，还诬蔑政府歧视少数民族，不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，连宰牛也要限制。
    第三，仇视回民干部和党团员，辱骂积极分子。他们骂回民干部是“都士曼”（即敌人），是“回奸”，说进步阿訇是“没有教门的人”。右派分子谢锡三在讲经时公开的谩骂党、团员，阻止他的海里凡（学生）参加共青团，说“入团就成了伊不里斯（魔鬼）了”。
  第四，群众揭发的大量事实证明，这些右派分子为了实现个人的政治野心，还进行着各种破坏祖国统一的反革命行动，组织反党、反社会主义的集团。右派分子白清章在1953年曾两次煽动回民暴动，使群众遭受损失，政府给予宽大处理，但是白清章仍不悔改，在大鸣大放期间，到处诬蔑党的民族政策，企图在回民中又煽动闹事。宁陵县阿訇、右派分子袁长修煽动回民和共产党拼，并且丧心病狂地唆使回民要先打本乡本社，再打县城，最后成立伊斯兰王国。南阳专区回民揭发了方城县阿訇宛金荣的反革命罪行。宛金荣在1948年就参加了反革命活动，解放后，受到政府的宽大处理，但是他仍不悔改，纠合一批反革命分子，准备暴动。还企图要到西安回民中煽动暴乱，说主要把绿旗插到西安，他还准备把不同意他暴动的阿訇都杀死。太康县阿訇、右派分子买永新、李金凯等组织反革命集团，自封为国王，总理，参谋总长，外交部长，阴谋暴动。
    隐藏在少数民族中，披着民族、宗教外衣的右派分子被揭发出来以后，引起了全省回民和伊斯兰教界的社头、阿訇、海里凡等的愤怒。1月份，河南省民族事务委员会召开了全省第四次扩大会议，参加会议的一百多个阿訇、社头、海里凡，集中批判、揭发了谢锡三、白清章、买明道等右派分子。全省各个专、县（市）的回民群众，也积极参与了反右派斗争。在各地召开的反右派斗争大会上，大家都以自己的亲身经历和新旧社会的对比，严厉地驳斥了右派分子诬蔑党、诬蔑新社会的反动谰调。郑州市回民在揭发谢锡三的大会上很多人在控诉解放前遭受国民党的惨酷压迫和剥削时，都声泪俱下。太康县回民在驳斥右派分子买永新等诬蔑“解放后回民生活越过越苦”的谎言时举出了该县城关区南关镇的例子。太康县南关回民解放前生活非常困苦，要饭的就有三十七户，1943年大灾荒时，曾经饿绝了五户，那时候，整个南关识字的回民只有四个人。解放后，南关回民分到了五百四十四亩土地，三十八头牲口，生活都很富裕，回民子弟入中、小学的也有一百四十多人。在大会上，群众质问右派分子：这是回民生活没有提高吗？曾经被右派分子马仅行造谣说饿肿了脸的朱仙真，也赶到大会上来揭发，他愤怒地说：“我一年到头吃得很好，脸长得白白胖胖，为什么右派分子要拿我向党进攻呢？”在揭发右派分子白清章的大会上，商丘专区回民多人控诉了白清章在制造民族纠纷中给回民带来的损失。很多人要找白清章清算，要他赔偿损失。通过说理斗争，各地回民群众和上层人士还批判了右派分子宣扬的地方民族主义和大伊斯兰主义。商丘专区回民用大量事实驳倒了右派分子宣传的“争教不争国”、“天下回民是一家”、“回族即回教”等谬论，并且指出，右派分子散布这些谬论的目的，在于模糊回民的爱国观念、阶级观念和敌我观念，以便他们继续进行对回族人民的反动统治。
    通过反右派斗争和深入批判了地方民族主义以后，右派分子在回民中已经孤立，广大回民的社会主义觉悟也大大提高。在全省的回族和伊斯兰教界中已经出现了一片新的景象。在民族和宗教界的上层人士已经普遍开展自我改造运动。在全省范围内形成了人人订规划，个个要改造的评比竞赛高潮。开封市在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，全市的阿訇、社头和海里凡都订了大跃进的规划，向全国和全省的伊斯兰教界阿訇倡议竞赛。过去阿訇从来都不参加生产，依靠回民的供养，但是在反右派斗争和社会主义教育以后，都纷纷自动要求参加生产。开封市全市阿訇决心在两年内做到自食其力，参加生产，为了表示决心，他们还自动投资一千多元，支援工农业生产大跃进，敲锣打鼓地向党委报喜。宁陵县阿訇马玉相保证全家两个劳动力都参加生产，今年做二百到三百个劳动日。在民族关系上也空前融洽，有些地方回、汉民之间多年的“疙瘩”解除了，民族联合社进一步巩固了。回民中私宰耕牛，抢购套购的现象也大大减少，在回民中已经到处都树立了劳动生产、勤俭持家和爱国守法的新风尚。
