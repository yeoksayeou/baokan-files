Albanian Children

Healthy and Lively

Albania now has a total of two thousand seven hundred and fifty schools. The number of children in school has tripled compared to before liberation. In addition, nearly four hundred new kindergartens and nurseries have been built.

The state cultivates children to be healthy and lively. Children regularly undergo physical examinations at hospitals. In the summer, many students go to Young Pioneer summer camps and children's sanatoriums for vacations. Children often spend their free time in well-equipped youth centers and sports fields.

    阿尔巴尼亚的儿童
    又健康又活泼
    阿尔巴尼亚现在共有两千七百五十所学校。在学的儿童比解放前增加了三倍。此外，还新建了将近四百所幼儿园和托儿所。
    国家把儿童培养成又健康又活泼的人。儿童们经常到医院进行体格检查。夏天，许多学生都到少先队夏令营和儿童休养所去度假。儿童们常在设备完善的少年之家和运动场度过课余时间。（附图片）
