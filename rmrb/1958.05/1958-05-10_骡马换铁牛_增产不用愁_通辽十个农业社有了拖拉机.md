Mules and Horses Traded for Iron Oxen: Increased Production No Longer a Worry
    Ten Agricultural Cooperatives in Tongliao Now Have Tractors

    (Our Dispatch) The ten agricultural cooperatives in Qianjiadian Town and Jiaoganningzi Township, Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, recently acquired their own tractors. Since late March, the cooperatives have been using eleven tractors for stubble removal, sowing, and other operations. The members happily said, "Mules and horses traded for iron oxen, increased production is no longer a worry!"

    In recent years, these agricultural cooperatives have been helped by nearby state-owned tractor stations and have achieved increased production through machine farming. The members have been eagerly hoping to have collectively owned and managed tractors. This year, in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agriculture, the cooperatives, after a decision by the members' congress, used the cooperatives' public accumulation funds and adopted a payment-in-installments method to entrust the Qianjiadian Tractor Station to purchase eleven tractors. After Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative purchased two tractors, it increased its per-mu yield target from 660 jin to 800 jin, and the collective pig raising target also jumped from the original 400 to 2,000. Advanced No. 3 Cooperative spent 6,500 yuan to buy a tractor, which can save six large carts, twenty-four draft horses, and 3,600 man-days. The cooperative organized these carts, horses, and manpower into transportation brigades and brick kilns, etc., and it is estimated that it can increase net income by 19,000 yuan within the year.

    骡马换铁牛　增产不用愁
    通辽十个农业社有了拖拉机
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区通辽县钱家店镇和角干营子乡的十个农业社，最近有了自己的拖拉机。从3月下旬开始，社里就使用十一台拖拉机进行灭槎、播种等作业。社员高兴地说：“骡马换铁牛，增产不用愁！”
    近年来，这些农业社曾得到附近国营拖拉机站的帮助，用机器耕作得到增产，社员们一心盼望能够有社有社营的拖拉机。今年各社为适应农业大跃进需要，经过社员大会决定，用社内公共积累资金，采取分期付款办法，委托钱家店拖拉机站买进了十一台拖拉机。红星一社买到两台拖拉机后，已将亩产量指标由六百六十斤提高到八百斤，集体养猪指标也从原来的四百口跃到两千口。先进三社花六千五百元买来一台拖拉机，可省出六台大车、二十四匹耕马、三千六百个人工，社里把这些车马人力编成运输大队和开砖窑等，预计年内能增加纯收入一万九千元。
