Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 24th. The Director of the News Bureau of the United Arab Republic, Afra, said on the evening of the 23rd that Lebanon's complaint to the Security Council against the United Arab Republic is a continuation of the imperialist conspiracy against Syria and Egypt, and later against the United Arab Republic, since the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact in 1955.

He specifically accused the United States of instigating Lebanon to file the complaint. He said that Dulles, in order to support the rulers of Lebanon, groundlessly accused the United Arab Republic, and the responsible authorities in the United States expressed their support for it even before Lebanon's complaint was submitted to the Security Council and the content of the complaint was announced.

Afra pointed out that when the people of Lebanon rose up against their domestic rulers and demanded the rejection of the Eisenhower Doctrine, imperialism, in order to maintain its policy of aggression and its own survival, attempted to create an opportunity for blatant foreign intervention and to sow discord among the Arab people and nations. In order to cover up their interference in Lebanese affairs, the imperialists tried to make the situation appear as if the United Arab Republic was interfering.

    阿拉伯联合共和国新闻局长
    指责美国唆使黎巴嫩诬告
    据新华社开罗24日电　阿拉伯联合共和国新闻局长阿弗拉23日晚上说，黎巴嫩向安全理事会控诉阿拉伯联合共和国的做法，是1955年巴格达条约缔结以来帝国主义反对叙利亚和埃及以及后来反对阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋的继续。
    他特别指责美国唆使黎巴嫩提出控诉。他说，杜勒斯为了给黎巴嫩的统治者撑腰，无凭无据地指责阿拉伯联合共和国，而美国的负责当局甚至在黎巴嫩的控诉还没有向安全理事会提出和控诉的内容还没有公布以前，就对它表示支持。
    阿弗拉指出，当黎巴嫩的人民起来反对他们国内的统治者，并且要求拒绝艾森豪威尔主义的时候，帝国主义为了维护它的侵略政策和它本身的生存，竟企图为赤裸裸的外国干涉制造机会，并且在阿拉伯的人民和国家中散播不和。为了掩饰他们对黎巴嫩事务的干涉，帝国主义者力图把局势说得好像是阿拉伯联合共和国方面在进行干涉。
