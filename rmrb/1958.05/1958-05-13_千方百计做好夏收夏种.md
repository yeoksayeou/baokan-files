Do Everything Possible to Ensure a Good Summer Harvest and Planting

This year's summer crops are growing very well. Whether it's wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, or peas, the yields will exceed any previous year in history. According to current estimates, the provinces and cities where winter wheat production is expected to increase by 80% to more than double compared to 1957 account for about one-quarter; those with an increase of 30% to 50% account for about one-third; and the remaining provinces and cities are also expected to increase by 15% to 30%. It is expected that the first battle in the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 will achieve a great victory. Winning this battle will not only lay a solid material foundation for the great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the year, but will also greatly enhance the courage and confidence to achieve the national agricultural development program's production targets ahead of schedule. Of particular note is that, during the wheat production process this year, approximately 100 million mu of high-yield fields were cultivated on a large scale, and there are already quite a few wheat fields with a potential yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. These high-yield fields have set an example for the rapid increase in wheat yield per unit area in the future and pointed out the way forward. The current prosperous scene is the result of the hard work of the vast number of farmers in various regions under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, fighting hard throughout the winter and working vigorously in the spring.

However, it must be pointed out that the bumper harvest of summer crops is still an estimate. Although this estimate is well-founded, we must fully consider all possible unexpected events before we finally get the crops in hand. We must now be vigilant against complacency and paralysis that may arise in the face of a bumper harvest. Before harvesting, the management of wheat fields cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Several million mu of wheat fields in Jiangsu Province have already suffered from wind, rain, and hail. Pests and diseases are still serious in some areas. All possible methods must be taken to reduce losses. The lodging phenomenon in high-yield fields must continue to be prevented. The closer we get to the harvest season, the greater the losses caused by disasters. We must continue to mobilize the masses to advance victoriously, redouble our efforts, overcome all disasters, and resolutely get the fruits of the bumper harvest into our hands. Wheat matures quickly, and the harvest time is very tight. Party and government leaders at all levels and all the people must immediately take action, make preparations for the summer harvest, harvest and thresh in a timely manner, and ensure high yields and bumper harvests.

The characteristics of this year's summer harvest are heavy tasks, high requirements, and tight time. The workload of summer crop harvesting has greatly increased compared to previous years. At the same time, the task of expanding paddy fields in various provinces has also greatly increased. In the new rice-growing areas, stubble rice accounts for about 70%, which requires immediate land preparation, flooding, and transplanting after wheat is harvested. Summer-sown sweet potatoes and corn should be universally deep-plowed, with sufficient base fertilizer applied and sown as early as possible. Field management of spring-sown crops cannot be relaxed. In order to do a good job in both summer harvesting and planting at the same time, more than 8,000 agricultural cooperatives in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, are mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and rationally arrange labor; at the same time, they are rushing to complete various agricultural tasks that can be done in advance, such as delivering manure and preparing threshing grounds. In order to improve labor efficiency, this prefecture is vigorously promoting new-style farm tools, continuing to carry out tool reforms on a large scale, expanding warehouses, and making preparations for the wheat harvest as early as possible. The Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province launched a mass debate on the summer harvest and planting throughout the region. The main contents of the debate were: the role of doing a good job in the summer harvest and planting in ensuring a bumper harvest throughout the year; the new situation and new tasks of this year's summer harvest and planting; preparing early versus preparing late; harvesting and planting early versus harvesting and planting late; how to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, returning every grain to the granary; and how various departments and systems support the summer harvest and planting. This is the ideological and political guarantee for fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to do a good job in the summer harvest and planting. Party and government leaders at all levels must devote greater efforts to leading this movement to ensure a good harvest and planting, not dropping a single grain of wheat, and not missing a single day of autumn.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, it is necessary to summarize and vigorously promote various experiences such as careful harvesting and clean threshing, and preventing rain damage, improve harvesting speed and quality, and strive to harvest one piece of yellow field after another, achieving "four fasts" (fast harvesting, fast bundling, fast pulling, fast threshing) and "four cleans" (clean harvesting in the field, clean threshing on the threshing ground, clean winnowing of wheat grains, clean picking up of wheat ears), and avoid all losses. In Luyi County, Henan Province, in 1956, the per-mu yield of wheat harvested before the rain was 135 jin, the per-mu yield of wheat harvested early after the rain was 115 jin, and the per-mu yield of wheat harvested late after the rain was less than 100 jin. This fact fully illustrates the importance of seizing the summer harvest.

To do these things well, the first is to strengthen political and ideological education for the commune members. In the past, some agricultural cooperative members only sought work points and did not seek quality, only willing to harvest the good crops and unwilling to harvest the bad crops, only willing to harvest the standing crops and unwilling to harvest the fallen crops, leaving high wheat stubble, dropping many wheat ears, and even holding back a hand and not threshing cleanly. These bad phenomena must be overcome. We must educate all commune members to work together with one heart, harvest and thresh carefully and meticulously, and ensure that every grain returns to the granary. Secondly, we must make a good summer harvest labor plan, rationally organize labor and animal power according to the needs of agricultural work, give full play to the labor potential of commune members, and ensure that men, women, old, and young all participate, everyone has something to do, and everything has a specific responsibility; we must also carry out labor competitions with fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed quality. When wind and rain disasters strike, we must also have the preparation of shock forces. At the same time, we must pay attention to organizing socialist cooperation to ensure that if one team has difficulties, the whole commune will support it. If one commune has difficulties, the whole township will support it. Townships and communes, plains and mountains, can all support each other. Thirdly, we must carefully do a good job in the pre-harvest distribution, reasonably estimate production based on actual conditions, and rationally distribute, so as to further improve the production enthusiasm of the masses. Fourthly, we must vigorously organize organs, schools, troops, and urban residents to actively participate in the summer harvest. Anhui Province mobilized all urban transportation vehicles to support farmers in harvesting wheat during the tense wheat harvest season last year, which is a good experience. The potential of urban mechanical power is very great. Universal mobilization has a great effect on solving the difficulties of labor and animal power during the wheat harvest season and ensuring a good harvest and planting.

To do a good job in the summer harvest and planting, it is also necessary to actively create and improve the tools for summer harvesting and planting, and give full play to the effectiveness of new-style tools. Recently, more than 20 counties and cities in Henan have successively trial-produced various summer harvest farm tools. These new farm tools generally improve work efficiency by several times or more than ten times. The man-powered harvester successfully trial-produced in Yiyang County improves efficiency by 14 to 19 times compared with the use of old-style farm tools. The manpower harvester successfully trial-produced in Song County can harvest 10 mu of wheat per day by one person. The thresher successfully trial-produced in Zhengzhou City can thresh 20,000 jin of wheat per day. In Zhamu Township, Jianli County, Hubei Province, 14 cooperatives were vehicularized and 4 cooperatives were vehicularized and boat-ized during this year's wheat harvest, and the flail threshing was changed to chaffing and rolling. These can greatly improve efficiency. In short, all available advanced tools and advanced experiences must be fully utilized to do the summer harvest work as soon as possible.

While harvesting wheat, we must also prepare for next year's wheat harvest, arrange for seed selection as soon as possible, organize visits and comparisons, summarize high-yield experiences, study autumn (winter) sowing, and prepare for a bumper harvest of summer crops next year.

The total planting area of wheat and barley in China is about 500 million mu. If the average yield per mu can be increased by 100 jin on the original basis, the total output can reach more than 100 billion jin, which is equivalent to more than one-quarter of the total national grain output in 1957. The experience of the great leap forward in agricultural production this year—seizing the first season and striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops—will be an important step in the great leap forward in agricultural production in the future. Grasping this link will have a very important effect on changing the face of agricultural production in my country, accelerating socialist construction, and improving people's lives.

　　千方百计做好夏收夏种
    今年夏收作物生长很好。不论小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆和豌豆，产量都将超过历史上任何一年。根据目前情况估计，今年冬小麦产量比1957年增产八成到一倍以上的省、市约占四分之一，增产三成到五成的省、市约占三分之一，其余省、市的增产也都在一成半到三成。可以预期，1958年农业生产大跃进中第一个战役将获得伟大的胜利。这一仗打胜了，不仅将为全年农业生产大跃进打下可靠的物质基础，而且将大大增强提前实现全国农业发展纲要的生产指标的勇气和信心。尤其值得注意的，是今年小麦生产过程中培育了约一亿亩左右大面积丰产田，亩产可能达到千斤以上的麦田已经不在少数。这些丰产田为今后小麦单位面积产量的迅速提高树立了榜样，指出了前进的道路。目前所呈现的丰收景象，是各地广大农民在各级党委和政府领导下苦战一冬、大干一春的结果。
    但是，必须指出，夏收作物丰收还是一种估计，尽管这种估计是有充分根据的，在没有最后把东西拿到手之前，对一切可能发生的意外事件必须充分考虑到。现在必须警惕在丰收面前可能产生的自满和麻痹情绪。在收割之前，麦田管理不能丝毫放松。江苏省已经有几百万亩麦田遭受风雨和冰雹。病虫害在某些地区还是严重的。必须采取一切可能的方法减少损失。丰产田的倒伏现象还要继续防止。愈到收获季节临近的时候，遭受灾害所带来的损失愈大，愈要继续动员群众乘胜前进，再鼓一把劲，战胜一切灾害，坚决把丰收的果实拿到手里。小麦成熟很快，收割时间十分紧迫，各地党政领导和全体人民必须立即行动起来，做好夏收准备工作，及时收割脱粒，确保丰产丰收。
    今年夏收的特点是任务重，要求高，时间紧。夏收作物收获工作量比往年大为增加。同时，各省扩大稻田任务也大大增加。在新稻区麦茬稻占70％左右，需要在割麦以后立即进行稻田整地、放水泡田和插秧。夏播红薯、玉米要普遍深耕，施足底肥，及早下种。春播作物田间管理又不能放松。为了同时做好夏收夏种工作，湖北襄阳专区八千多个农业社正在发动群众献计献策，合理安排劳动力；同时把各种可以提前做的农活如送粪、整理麦场等提前赶出来。为了提高劳动效率，这个专区正在大力推广新式农具，继续大搞工具改革，增修仓库，提早做好各项麦收准备工作。中共河南省商丘地委，在全区范围内开展了一次群众性的夏收夏种大辩论，辩论的主要内容是：搞好夏收夏种对保证全年丰收的作用；今年夏收夏种的新情况和新任务；早准备还是晚准备；快收早种还是慢收迟种；怎样作到细收细打，颗粒还家；各部门各系统如何支援夏收夏种等问题。这是充分发动群众依靠群众作好夏收夏种的思想政治保证。各级党政领导必须拿出更大的力量来领导这个运动，保证收好种好，不掉一粒麦，不误一天秋。
    为了确保小麦丰产丰收，必须及时总结并大力推广细收净打、防止雨害等各种经验，提高收获速度和收获质量，争取黄一片收一片，做到“四快”（快收、快捆、快拉、快打）、“四净”（地里收净、场上打净、麦粒扬净、麦穗拾净），避免一切损失。河南省鹿邑县1956年雨前收的小麦亩产一百三十五斤，雨后早收的一百一十五斤，雨后晚收的还不到一百斤。这个事实充分说明了抓紧夏收的重要性。
    为了做好这些，首先是要对社员加强政治思想教育。过去有些农业社社员只求工分，不求质量，只愿割好的，不愿割坏的，只愿割立的，不愿割倒的，麦茬留的高，麦穗掉的多，甚至还有留一手不打净的，这些不好的现象必须克服。要教育全体社员大家一条心，认真细收细打，保证颗粒还仓。其次，要做好夏收劳动规划，按照农活需要合理组织劳畜力，充分发挥社员劳动潜力，做到男女老少齐动手，人人有事做，事事有专责；还要开展定时、定量、定质的劳动竞赛。在风雨灾害袭来的时候，还要有突击力量的准备。与此同时，要注意组织社会主义的协作，保证一队有困难，全社支援。一社有困难，全乡支援。乡乡社社，平原山区，都能互相支援。第三，认真做好夏收预分工作，按实估产，合理分配，进一步提高群众生产积极性。第四，大力组织机关、学校、部队和城镇居民积极参加夏收。安徽省去年麦收紧张季节把城市运输工具全部动员起来支援农民收麦，这是一条好经验。城镇机械动力的潜力很大，普遍动员起来，对于解决麦收季节劳畜力困难，保证收好种好，有极大的作用。
    要做好夏收夏种，还必须积极创造和改进夏收夏种的工具，充分发挥新式工具的效用。河南最近有二十多个县市先后试制成功各种夏收农具，这些新农具一般能提高工作效率几倍或十多倍。宜阳县试制成功的人推收割机，较使用旧式农具提高效率十四倍到十九倍。嵩县试制成功的人力收割机，一人操作每天可收小麦十亩。郑州市试制成功的脱粒机，每天能打麦两万斤。湖北省监利县柘木乡今年麦收中有十四个社车子化，四个社车船化，并改槤枷打场为铡穗磙碾。这些都能大大提高效率。总之，要把一切可能利用的先进工具和先进经验，都充分利用起来，尽快地把夏收工作做好。
    在收麦的同时，还要为下一年小麦丰收做好准备，及早布置选种，组织参观评比，总结丰产经验，研究秋（冬）播，为明年夏收作物大丰收作好准备。
    我国小麦大麦种植面积计约五亿亩左右。如果能在原有基础上每亩平均增产一百斤，总产量即可达一千亿斤以上，约相当于1957年全国粮食总产量四分之一以上。今年农业生产大跃进的经验——抓住头季，力争夏收作物丰收，将是今后农业生产大跃进的重要的一步。抓住这个环节，对于改变我国农业生产面貌，加速社会主义建设和改善人民生活，都将发生极其重要的作用。
