Bi-Weekly International Review
(April 19th to May 3rd)

	The Capitalist World is Unstable

	The decline of the U.S. economy continues to worsen. In April, for the week ending the 19th, the operating rate of the steel industry had fallen to 48%. In the first sixteen weeks of this year, construction contracts were down 9% compared to 1957. The agricultural surplus is also very serious. It is estimated that, for wheat alone, this year there will be an excess of 180 million bushels (one bushel equals 36 liters) beyond domestic and foreign sales, with no way out. These all indicate the blind development of U.S. productivity, causing cyclical economic crises, and this phenomenon of overproduction is deepening due to the continually decreasing number of new orders. By early April, the output of major industrial products in the U.S. had fallen sharply. Compared with the same period in 1957, steel production was down 45%, coal 24%, oil 16%, automobiles 40%, and machinery and equipment 20%. The number of factory closures increased by 21% compared to February, with 1,495 closures in March.

	However, the U.S. ruling group is promoting the idea that there will be a new surge in industrial production this autumn. Will there really be a new surge? According to a survey by the U.S. "McGraw-Hill" publishing company of industrial, transportation, and trading companies, over the next four years, investments by U.S. companies to expand and update fixed capital will continue to decline from the proposed $34 billion in 1958 to $29.6 billion in 1961. The conclusion that can be drawn from this material is the exact opposite. The decline in U.S. industrial production is only in its initial stage and will inevitably continue for a considerable period.

	The economic crisis is having a chain reaction throughout the capitalist world. The U.S. economic crisis has increased the economic difficulties of other countries, and the economic difficulties of other countries have deepened the U.S. crisis. In recent years, among capitalist countries, West Germany in the West and Japan in the East have had "good luck" in production. However, the expansion of fixed capital and the scope of construction in West Germany have both been shrinking, and 3 million tons of coal have accumulated in the Ruhr; Japan's boasted "Jimmu Boom," an unprecedented prosperity since Emperor Jimmu, has disappeared, and it faces a crisis of overproduction. Japan's steel production in 1957 was 12.57 million tons. Due to product accumulation and a sharp drop in prices, it has been decided to reduce production in the first quarter of this year by 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 1957. Signs of crisis have also appeared in other capitalist countries. The number of unemployed in Britain accounts for 2% of the total number of registered workers. On April 1st, 218 merchant ships, totaling more than one million tons, were idle in Britain. In France, prices are soaring, exports are declining, and import surpluses are skyrocketing. In Canada, the number of unemployed has reached more than 880,000, accounting for 15% of the national labor force. Latin American countries, due to the U.S. raising tariffs and lowering raw material prices, have put some countries, such as Brazil, on the verge of economic bankruptcy. A wave of closures has swept through tin mines in Malaya. The price of wool in Pakistan has fallen by 50%, and 90% of its wool is sold to the U.S. and Britain, but now it cannot find buyers.

	In stark contrast to the turbulent situation in the capitalist world, socialist countries are showing a flourishing scene, all overfulfilling their first-quarter production plans. This is already something that even capitalist countries cannot deny. At the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe conference, which closed in Geneva on April 24, the report "On the State of the European Economy in 1957" pointed out that economic recession is continuing to develop in the United States, Western European countries have entered a difficult period, while the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies have achieved great development. Even U.S. spy chief and CIA Director Allen Dulles cannot but admit that the Soviet Union's industrial development is exceeding that of the United States. In the first quarter of this year, Soviet industrial production increased by 11% compared to a year ago, while the U.S. declined by 11%. He said that the steel production of the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European countries in the first quarter of this year exceeded that of the United States for the first time in history.

	Economic crisis inevitably leads to political crisis. Workers, driven by the need to survive, have significantly increased their strike struggles. London's 500,000 bus workers are preparing to strike from the 4th, which is one of the larger recent strikes. In France, strike events have occurred one after another, and after the fall of the Gaillard cabinet, a new government is still difficult to produce. The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government also announced the dissolution of the Diet on April 25 under the pressure of a no-confidence motion from the Socialist Party. The class struggle within the capitalist world, especially within major capitalist countries, will become increasingly fierce with changes in the economic situation.

	New Provocations for Peace by the U.S. and Britain

	Regarding the summit conference to promote the easing of international tensions, although Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko has already made contact with the U.S., British, and French ambassadors in Moscow, Western countries are still adopting delaying tactics on the summit. On the one hand, they are afraid of openly preparing for the meeting; on the other hand, until now, Western countries have not expressed their opinions on where, when, and which countries will participate. They take a passive attitude towards preparations for the meeting, but are very active in activities that threaten peace. U.S. planes carrying hydrogen bombs have flown several times towards the Soviet border. After rejecting the Soviet proposal, Britain, disregarding the expectations of people around the world, began hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island on April 29.

	Since the Soviet Union exposed the fact that U.S. planes carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs, under the command of the U.S. command, had flown more than once through the Arctic region to the Soviet border, seriously threatening world peace, world public opinion has unanimously condemned and protested against this crazy and dangerous provocative behavior by the United States. The United Nations Security Council has already held two meetings to discuss this issue. The Soviet Union demanded that the United States stop this provocative behavior and also demanded that the threat of sudden attack be prevented through a summit meeting. However, the United States used its majority in the Security Council to obstruct the continuation of the discussion of this issue in the first meeting, and in the second meeting, it proposed a so-called "Arctic inspection" issue, attempting to use the pretext of ensuring "security" and "establishing trust" to allow U.S. planes to fly over Soviet territory in the name of "Arctic inspection." The United States is attempting to use this proposal to divert attention, evade its responsibility for threatening peace, and once again demonstrates that the United States has no interest in easing tensions.

	The Soviet Union has already decided to stop testing nuclear weapons, and on April 23, Khrushchev wrote to the U.S. President again, requesting that an agreement be reached with the U.S. and Britain on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing, indicating that the Soviet Union will no longer detonate an atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb in the future, unless the U.S. and Britain force the Soviet Union to do so. Therefore, whether to permanently end nuclear weapons testing or continue testing will depend on the United States and Britain. However, the U.S. and Britain have repeatedly claimed that they refuse to accept the Soviet Union's proposal. The British government blatantly disregarded the wishes and expectations of the British people and the hundreds of millions of people around the world, and conducted a hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island on April 29. This is a provocative act by the British government against peace-loving people all over the world, against the British people, and also against the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing.

	Faced with new provocations for peace by the U.S. and Britain, the Soviet Union is strengthening its struggle from all aspects, exposing to the world the U.S. and British policies of adhering to the "Cold War," and at the same time, continuously issuing warnings to the U.S. and Britain. On April 30, Khrushchev said at a banquet welcoming Nasser's visit to the Soviet Union: We will strive to ease international tensions, eliminate the "Cold War," and resolve the issue of disarmament. However, we must remain vigilant and cannot relax our attention to consolidating our own country, so that when aggressors attempt to cross the boundaries of the "Cold War" and turn the "Cold War" into a "hot war," the Soviet Union can give the aggressors a powerful counterattack.

	At the same time, the Soviet Union signed economic and trade agreements and consular treaties with West Germany, and Mikoyan and Adenauer issued a joint communique stating that both sides would strive to improve relations through peaceful means. Mikoyan also repeatedly stated that as long as West Germany does not build missile bases, even if a military conflict involving West Germany occurs in the future, the Soviet Union will not use nuclear weapons against West Germany. This statement further demonstrates that the Soviet Union is willing to take all measures to build international trust in order to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons to mankind. This statement by the Soviet Union makes it impossible for all those who create various excuses for atomic war preparations to find any reason. People all over the world will be even more encouraged by these facts to continue to persist in the struggle against nuclear weapons testing and to strive to ease international tensions.

	On the Front Against Colonialism

	From April 15th to 22nd, the eight independent African countries, Ghana, the United Arab Republic, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Liberia, held a meeting in Accra. The slogan "Don't interfere in Africa, Africa must be free" put forward by this meeting reflected the strong desire of the African people to strive for independence and freedom and to defend their independence and freedom. The meeting declared that the independent African countries were loyal to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Bandung Conference Declaration, determined to protect their hard-won independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and decided to vigorously support the struggle for independence by Algeria and the people in non-independent parts of Africa. The meeting also strongly condemned the colonialists' policy of racial discrimination. This meeting fully demonstrated the unity of the independent African countries and the awakening of the African people.

	Less than a week after the end of the African Independent States Conference, the main political organizations of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria held the "Tangier Unity Conference" in Tangier, the capital of Tunisia. During the four days from April 27th to 30th, the meeting passed resolutions supporting Algeria's anti-French struggle, condemning France's intensification of the Algerian war and its policies of using force and provocation in Tunisia and Morocco, demanding that France negotiate on the issue of a ceasefire in Algeria, proposing the establishment of an Algerian government, and proposing the establishment of a "North African Consultative Assembly" as a transitional stage before the establishment of a federation in North Africa. The leader of the Algerian National Liberation Front, Abbas, who attended the meeting, said that the Algerian people will continue to fight and will never give up until they achieve independence. The leader of the Moroccan Istiqlal Party, Fassi, said when talking about the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Morocco and Tunisia: "French troops, Spanish troops, and American troops are all birds of a feather." Undoubtedly, the Tangier Conference will strengthen the struggle of the North African people against imperialism.

	In Indonesia, the government army, with the support of the people, has achieved a decisive victory, and the rebels will eventually fail. However, U.S. imperialism has not given up. Recent events have shown that the United States is attempting to fully support the rebels entrenched in North Sulawesi to continue their resistance. Adventurers from the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are directly participating in the rebellion, using aircraft to help the rebels attack some ports and ships in Indonesia. Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda issued a statement on April 30, condemning foreign interference in Indonesia's affairs. Djuanda pointed out that the Indonesian government has sufficient evidence to show that it is due to the assistance of adventurers from the United States and Taiwan that the rebels have been able to carry out air raids on several towns in Indonesia. The blatant interference of U.S. imperialism in Indonesia is causing increasingly widespread indignation among the Indonesian people.

	British colonialists, in addition to continuing to attack nationalists in Oman, have recently intensified their bloody massacre of the people of Aden. The British Governor of Aden, on the one hand, invited the Sultan of the Lahej Sultanate for talks, and on the other hand, suddenly launched a raid on the Lahej Sultanate, attacking and looting the city. After encountering the heroic resistance of the local people, it dispatched warships to reinforce and also carried out a frantic bombing of the Zara Sultanate, using 1,000-pound bombs to massacre the local people. Yemeni Crown Prince Badr issued a statement condemning the British aggression and expressed that the Lahej Sultanate is a brother of Yemen, and the struggle of the Lahej people is the struggle of the Yemeni people themselves.

	All conspiracies of imperialism to undermine nationally independent countries and suppress national independence movements in Asia and Africa can only be a dying struggle before the arrival of the end of colonialism. The flames of anti-colonialism are spreading from Asia to Africa, and are also shaking the land of Latin America, the backyard of the United States.

    半月国际述评
    （4月19日到5月3日）
    资本主义世界动荡不安
    美国经济继续下降的情况越来越严重了。4月份，到19日为止的一个星期，钢铁工业的开工率已下降到48％。建筑工业在今年前十六个星期里，建筑合同比1957年减少了9％。农业生产过剩也十分严重，据估计，光是麦子一项，今年除了内销和外销之外，要多出一亿八千万蒲式耳（一蒲式耳为三十六公升）没有出路。这些，都表明了美国生产力的盲目发展，造成了周期性的经济危机，而这种生产过剩的现象正由于目前逐日在继续减少的新订货数目，继续加深。到4月初，美国主要工业品的产量，急剧下降。同1957年同期比较，钢铁已减产45％，煤24％，石油16％，汽车40％，机器设备20％。工厂倒闭的数目比2月份增加了21％，3月份倒闭了一千四百九十五家。
    不过，美国的统治集团却在宣传今年秋天工业生产上会出现新的高涨。会不会真的有什么新的高涨呢？据美国的“麦克格劳·希尔”出版公司对工业、运输业和贸易公司的调查，今后四年，美国各公司用来扩大和更新固定资本的投资，将继续由1958年拟定的三百四十亿美元，逐年下降到1961年的二百九十六亿美元。从这个材料所能得出的结论，正好相反。美国工业生产的下降，现在还不过是开始的阶段，今后必然会继续一个相当长的时期。
    经济危机，在整个资本主义世界，正发生着连锁的反应。美国的经济危机，增加了别的国家的经济困难，而别的国家的经济困难，又加深着美国的危机。几年来，资本主义国家中，生产交着“好运”的，在西方要数西德，在东方要数日本。可是，西德的固定资本的扩大和建筑范围，已经都在缩小，煤在鲁尔已积压了三百万吨；日本吹嘘的“神武景气”，就是自从日本神武天皇以来空前未有的繁荣，已经消失，面临生产过剩的危机。日本钢的产量1957年为一千二百五十七万吨，由于产品积压，价格猛跌，已决定今年第一季度比1957年第四季度减产20％。危机的迹象，也已在其他的资本主义国家中出现。英国失业人数已占全部登记工人总数的2％，4月1日，在英国闲置未用的商船已达二百一十八艘，一百多万吨。法国物价飞涨，出口减少，入超激增。加拿大失业人数已达八十八万多人，占全国劳动力的15％。拉丁美洲国家，由于美国提高关税，压低原料价格，使得有些国家，如巴西，已处在经济破产的边缘。马来亚锡矿卷起一片倒风。巴基斯坦的羊毛价格下降50％，而它的羊毛90％是卖给美国和英国的，现在已找不到买主。
    同资本主义世界风雨飘摇情形完全相反，社会主义国家呈现一片兴盛气象，纷纷超额完成第一季度生产计划。这已经是连资本主义国家也不能不承认的了。4月24日在日内瓦闭幕的联合国欧洲经济委员会会议上，“关于1957年欧洲经济情况”的报告中指出，经济衰退情况正在美国继续发展，西欧国家已进入困难时期，而苏联和东欧人民民主国家的经济，却获得很大发展。连美国的特务头子、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯也不能不承认，苏联的工业发展有超过美国之势。今年第一季度，苏联工业生产比一年前增加了11％，而美国却下降了11％。他说苏联、中国和东欧国家今年第一季度的钢产量，在历史上第一次超过了美国。
    经济危机必然将引起政治危机。工人为生活所迫，罢工斗争已有了显著的增加。伦敦五十万公共汽车工人准备从4日开始罢工，是最近规模较大的一次。在法国，罢工事件此起彼伏，盖伊阿内阁倒台以后，新的政府还在难产中。日本岸信介政府也在社会党不信任案的压力下，于4月25日宣布解散国会。资本主义世界特别是主要资本主义国家内部的阶级斗争，将随着经济情况的变化而日趋剧烈。
    美国和英国对和平的新挑衅
    关于促进缓和国际紧张局势的最高级会议，虽然在莫斯科已经由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同美、英、法三国大使进行了接触，但是，西方国家对最高级会议仍采取着拖延的手段。它们一方面害怕对会议进行公开的准备工作；另一方面，直到现在，西方国家连对于在什么地方、什么时候开会，以及哪些国家参加，都没有表示意见。它们对会议的准备工作采取消极的态度，而对威胁和平的活动却十分积极。美国载着氢弹的飞机曾几次飞向苏联边境，英国在拒绝苏联建议之后，不顾全世界人民的期待，4月29日，在圣诞岛开始了氢弹试验。
    自从苏联揭穿了美国载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机，奉美国指挥部之命，曾经不止一次地通过北极地区向苏联边界飞行，严重地威胁了世界和平以后，全世界舆论一致谴责和抗议美国这种疯狂的危险挑衅行为。联合国安全理事会已经开过两次会议讨论这个问题。苏联要求停止美国这种挑衅行为，并且要求通过首脑会议来防止突然袭击的威胁。可是美国却利用了安理会中的多数，在第一次会议上，阻挠继续讨论这个问题，在第二次会议上，又提出一个所谓“北极视察”问题，企图借口保障“安全”和“建立信任”，以允许美国飞机借“北极视察”为名，飞行苏联领土上空。美国企图用这个提案来转移视线，逃避美国威胁和平的责任，又一次说明了美国对于缓和紧张局势，是丝毫没有兴趣的。
    在苏联已经决定停止试验核武器，并且在4月23日，由赫鲁晓夫又一次写信给美国总统，要求同美英就停止核武器试验这个问题达成协议，表示今后苏联将不再爆炸一枚原子弹，也不爆炸一枚氢弹，如果美国和英国不迫使苏联这样做的话。因之，是永远终止核武器试验呢？还是继续进行试验？这个问题将取决于美国和英国。但是，美国和英国，却一再声称拒绝接受苏联的建议。英国政府竟悍然不顾英国人民以及全世界千千万万人民的愿望和期待，于4月29日在圣诞岛进行了氢弹的试验。这是英国政府向全世界爱好和平的人民、向英国人民、也是向苏联停止核武器试验的决定的挑衅行为。
    面对着美英对和平的新挑衅，苏联正从各个方面加强斗争，向全世界揭穿美英坚持“冷战”的政策，同时，向美英不断发出了警告。4月30日，赫鲁晓夫在欢迎纳赛尔访苏的宴会上说：我们将争取使国际紧张局势得到缓和，消除“冷战”，解决裁军问题。然而，我们必须保持警惕，不能放松对巩固自己国家的注意力，以便当侵略者企图跨过“冷战”的界线而把“冷战”变成“热战”的时候，苏联能够给侵略者以有力的反击。
    在这同时，苏联同西德签订了经济贸易协定和领事条约，米高扬同阿登纳发表了双方尽力通过和平方法改善关系的联合公报。米高扬并且一再声明，只要西德不建立导弹基地，即使在将来发生了西德参加的军事冲突，苏联也将不对西德使用核武器。这个声明，进一步表明了苏联为消除核武器对人类的威胁，是不惜采取一切方法，来建立国际间的信任的。苏联的这个声明，使一切制造各种借口进行原子备战的狂人，再也拿不出一点理由了。全世界人民从这些事实里，将会得到更大的鼓舞，来继续坚持反对核武器试验，争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争。
    在反对殖民主义的战线上
    4月15日到22日，非洲的八个独立国家加纳、阿拉伯联合共和国、利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚，在阿克拉举行了会议。这个会议提出的“不要干涉非洲，非洲必须自由”口号，反映了非洲人民要求争取独立自由和保卫独立自由的强烈愿望。会议宣布了非洲独立国家忠于世界人权宣言和万隆会议的宣言，决心保障得来不易的独立、主权和领土完整，决定大力支持阿尔及利亚以及非洲未独立地方人民争取独立的斗争。会议还严厉谴责了殖民者的种族歧视政策。这个会议，充分表现了非洲独立国家的团结一致和非洲人民的觉醒。
    非洲独立国家会议结束不到一周，摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的主要政治组织又在突尼斯首都丹吉尔举行了“丹吉尔团结会议”。从4月27日到30日的四天里，会议通过决议，支持阿尔及利亚的反法斗争，谴责了法国加紧进行阿尔及利亚战争和在突尼斯和摩洛哥采取武力和挑衅的政策，要求法国就阿尔及利亚境内的停火问题进行谈判；建议阿尔及利亚成立政府，并建议成立“北非谘询议会”，作为在北非成立联邦之前的过渡阶段。参加会议的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖阿巴斯说，阿尔及利亚人民将继续战斗，不取得独立决不罢休。摩洛哥独立党领袖法席在谈到撤退驻扎在摩洛哥和突尼斯的外国军队的时候说：“法国军队、西班牙军队和美国军队都是一丘之貉。”无疑的丹吉尔会议将会加强北非人民反对帝国主义的斗争。
    在印度尼西亚方面，政府军在人民支持下已经取得了决定性的胜利，叛军终将最后失败。可是，美帝国主义并没有死心。最近的事情说明了，美国正在企图全力支持盘踞在北苏拉威西的叛乱分子继续顽抗，美国和蒋介石集团的冒险分子直接参加叛乱，以飞机帮助叛军袭击印度尼西亚的一些港口和船只。印度尼西亚总理朱安达在4月30日发表谈话，谴责了外国干涉印度尼西亚的活动。朱安达指出，印度尼西亚政府有足够的证据说明，由于美国和台湾的冒险分子的援助，叛乱分子才有可能对印度尼西亚的几个城镇进行空袭。美帝国主义对印度尼西亚的露骨干涉正引起印度尼西亚人民越来越普遍的愤慨。
    英国殖民者，最近除了继续进攻阿曼的民族主义者以外，又加紧了对亚丁人民的血腥屠杀。亚丁的英国总督，一方面请了拉赫杰酋长国的苏丹进行会谈，另一方面就突然向拉赫杰酋长国进行了突袭，攻城掠地。在遭到当地人民英勇的抗击以后，它调了军舰去增援，并且还对扎拉酋长国进行了疯狂的轰炸，用一千磅重的炸弹去屠杀当地的人民。也门王太子巴德尔发表声明，谴责英国的侵略行为，并且表示了拉赫杰酋长国是也门的兄弟，拉赫杰人民的斗争，就是也门人民自己的斗争。
    帝国主义破坏民族独立国家的一切阴谋活动，对于亚非地区民族独立运动的镇压，都只能是殖民主义末日到来前的垂死挣扎，反殖民主义的烈火，正由亚洲烧遍非洲，也震撼着美国的后院——拉丁美洲的大地。
