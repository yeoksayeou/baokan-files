Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd:  With the rapid development of the great leap forward in production, non-governmental cultural centers and stations in Jiangsu Province have sprung up like mushrooms after rain.  Up to now, 167 non-governmental cultural centers and 2,047 non-governmental cultural stations have been established in 2,100 townships throughout the province, along with a large number of clubs.

The non-governmental cultural centers and stations in Jiangsu were established by relying on the masses, running the stations thriftily, and adapting to local conditions. In towns with a population of around 10,000, non-governmental cultural centers are established. In general townships, non-governmental cultural stations are established. Some townships have several small market towns, and non-governmental cultural stations are established with the small market towns as units.  The equipment funds for non-governmental cultural centers and stations are resolved through voluntary productive labor by cultural activity backbone personnel and assistance from various departments, based on the principle of running the stations "poorly" and making do with whatever is available. For example, the Shuoji non-governmental cultural station in Funing County has 10 yuan per month for operating expenses, which is the money from the manure of a large public toilet allocated by the township government.

The non-governmental cultural centers and stations all focus on current production, publicizing the Party and state policies and laws, popularizing agricultural science and health knowledge, organizing mass cultural and recreational activities, and making every effort to serve production.  Focusing on the key issues in production, they hold various exhibitions such as "Great Leap Forward in Production," "Close Planting of Rice," and "Eliminating the Four Pests."  They organize local artistic talents to write jingles and small performances, so that there are poems on every wall, calligraphy and paintings everywhere, entertainment and storytelling everywhere, and everyone sings about the Great Leap Forward.  In order to adapt to the characteristics of production, cultural activities are also taken to the fields and delivered to the door, organizing mobile exhibitions, book bags, and cultural boxes in the fields and construction sites for the commune members to carry out recreational activities during breaks.  The non-governmental cultural centers and stations in Changshu County, focusing on the county party committee's requirements of ten points for targets, twelve points for measures, and twenty-four points for effort, compiled production newsletters, arranged glory rooms and glory stages, and delivered good news to carry out various publicity activities.

    依靠群众　因地制宜　勤俭办馆站
    江苏有两千多个民办文化馆站
    据新华社南京23日电　随着生产跃进形势的飞跃发展，江苏省民办文化馆站像雨后春笋似的蓬勃发展，到目前为止，已在全省二千一百个乡镇上建立了一百六十七个民办文化馆，二千零四十七个民办文化站，还有大量的俱乐部。
    江苏民办文化馆站是依靠群众勤俭办站和因地制宜建立起来的，在一万人口左右的市镇上，建立民办文化馆，一般乡镇建立民办文化站，也有一乡有几个小集镇的，以小集镇为单位建立民办文化站。民办文化馆站的设备经费，在“穷”办站、因陋就简的原则下，由文化活动骨干义务生产劳动以及各部门帮助解决的。如阜宁县硕集民办文化站每月有十元钱的业务费，是乡政府划给的一个大毛厕的粪钱。
    民办文化馆站都围绕当前生产，宣传党和国家的政策法令、普及农业科学和卫生知识，组织群众性的文化娱乐活动，千方百计，为生产服务。以生产中的关键问题为主，分别举办“生产大跃进”、“水稻密植”、“除四害”等各种展览会。组织当地文艺人才编写顺口溜、小演唱，做到墙墙有诗，处处有字画，到处有文娱说唱，人人歌唱大跃进。为了适应生产特点，又把文化活动挑下地，送上门，在田头、工地组织流动展览、图书袋、文化箱，供社员们在休息时进行文娱活动。常熟县民办文化馆站围绕县委提出的十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲的要求，编写生产快报，布置光荣室、光荣台、送喜报等开展各种宣传活动。
