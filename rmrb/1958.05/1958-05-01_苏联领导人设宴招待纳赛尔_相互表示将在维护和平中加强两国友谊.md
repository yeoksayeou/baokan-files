    Soviet Leaders Host Nasser at Banquet
    Mutual Intention to Strengthen Friendship Between the Two Countries in Maintaining Peace
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: TASS reported from Moscow: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, hosted a banquet in the Kremlin on the 29th in honor of the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser.
    Also attending the banquet on the side of the United Arab Republic were Vice Presidents Boghdadi and Hourani, as well as other members of the President's entourage.
    Attending the banquet on the Soviet side were Aristov, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Kosygin, and other leaders of the Soviet state.
    Voroshilov and Nasser delivered speeches at the banquet.
    In his speech, Voroshilov pointed out that the heroic struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic to consolidate their independence and safeguard their sovereignty is a brilliant and inspiring example for the people of all countries in Asia and Africa.
    Voroshilov said that during the difficult days of Egypt, during the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, the Soviet people stood shoulder to shoulder with the Egyptian people. Voroshilov stressed that our Arab friends can rest assured that in the future, the Soviet Union will also strive in every way to ensure peace and security in the Near and Middle East.
    In his speech, Nasser said that the people of the United Arab Republic deeply appreciate the friendly feelings and cooperative spirit of the Soviet Union towards all the problems facing the Arabs.
    Referring to Egypt's struggle for independence and against imperialism, Nasser said, "Friends, I would like to reiterate that your support for our cause has played a huge role in ensuring our victory in this battle. The policy you have adopted of supporting the Arab countries in defending their freedom and independence has given hope to the people of those countries that are still fighting for their liberation. Imperialism panicked and could find no other way but to launch a war to bring the Arab countries in the Middle East under its submission. Your support and your ultimatum were a factor in safeguarding the freedom and public opinion in this region of the world. The people of the countries in this region then began to fight for their rights, feeling that they were not isolated in this struggle, that there were friendly countries standing by them, defending their rights, and helping them to cope with political and economic warfare. In this way, the cause of freedom for the people of all countries hoping to gain independence has been consolidated."
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: TASS reported from Moscow: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic and Soviet leaders held talks in the Kremlin on the 30th.
    Accompanying President Nasser at the talks on the side of the United Arab Republic were Vice Presidents Boghdadi and Hourani, Minister of Education Hussein, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fawzi, etc.
    Participating in the talks on the Soviet side were Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mukhitdinov, and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.
    Today, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, hosted a banquet in the Kremlin in honor of Nasser. Attending the banquet were Soviet leaders and other distinguished guests from the United Arab Republic accompanying President Nasser.

    苏联领导人设宴招待纳赛尔
    相互表示将在维护和平中加强两国友谊
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫29日在克里姆林宫设宴招待阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔。
    阿拉伯联合共和国方面出席宴会的还有副总统波格达迪和胡拉尼以及总统的其他随行人员。
    苏联方面出席宴会的有阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、布尔加宁、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、柯西金和苏维埃国家其他领导人。
    伏罗希洛夫和纳赛尔在宴会上讲了话。
    伏罗希洛夫在讲话中指出，阿拉伯联合共和国人民为巩固他们的独立和维护他们的主权而进行的英勇斗争是亚洲和非洲各国人民的光辉的、令人鼓舞的榜样。
    伏罗希洛夫说，在埃及的艰难日子里，在英、法、以三国对埃及发动武装侵略的期间，苏联人民同埃及人民并肩站在一起。伏罗希洛夫着重指出，我们的阿拉伯朋友可以安心相信，在将来，苏联也将努力以一切方式保障中近东的和平和安全。
    纳赛尔在讲话中说，阿拉伯联合共和国人民深深体会到苏联对待阿拉伯人面临的一切问题的友好感情和合作精神。
    纳赛尔在谈到埃及争取独立、反对帝国主义的斗争时说，朋友们，我愿意重提一下，你们对我们的事业的支持，对保证我们在这场战斗中的胜利，起了巨大的作用。你们采取的支持阿拉伯国家保卫它们已经获得的自由和独立的政策，使那些迄今还在为自己的解放而斗争的各国人民产生了希望。帝国主义发了慌，找不到其他办法，只好发动战争，来使中东地区阿拉伯国家屈从于它。你们的支持和你们的最后通牒是维护了世界这个地区的自由和民心的一个因素。这个地区的各国人民当时开始为自己的权利而斗争，他们感觉到他们在这场斗争中并不是孤立的，感觉到有友好的国家跟他们站在一边，保卫他们的权利，帮助他们对付政治和经济战争。这样，希望得到独立的各国人民的自由事业就得到了巩固。
