Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, May 27th: According to geological exploration personnel recently returned to the Yumen Oilfield from Turpan, the area is a basin with high oil-bearing potential. Twenty-nine oil-bearing structures and possible oil-bearing structures have been discovered, and oil sand and oil seepages are found in many places.

　　The "Flaming Mountains" described in "Journey to the West" are located within the basin. Three oil-bearing structures have been discovered on the Flaming Mountains in the past, and the Shengjinkou structure, which has a high oil-bearing potential, is located in the western part of the mountains. Oil-bearing sandstone and thick crude oil outcrop intermittently for fifteen kilometers on the eastern part of the Flaming Mountains. The Flaming Mountains are about one hundred and twenty kilometers long, composed of red rock formations, rising five hundred to seven hundred meters above the ground. The mountain tops are often shrouded in sand and mist, and under the sunlight, the entire mountain turns red, resembling a furnace fire. The weather here is very hot; in March, when they went up the mountain to observe the terrain, they were sweating even in thin clothes.

　　This year, the Yumen Oilfield will vigorously drill on six structures in the Turpan Basin.

    “火焰山”上储油多
    据新华社玉门27日电  据最近从吐鲁番返回玉门油矿的地质勘探人员说，那里是一个含油希望很大的盆地。已发现的储油构造和可能储油构造有二十九个，许多地方发现有油砂和油苗露头。
    “西游记”中描述的“火焰山”就在盆地内。在火焰山上过去就发现三个储油构造，含油希望较大的胜金口构造就在山的西部。在火焰山东部露出地面的含油砂岩和浓稠原油断断续续达十五公里。火焰山长约一百二十公里，由一些红色的岩层组成，高出地面五百到七百公尺，山顶常为沙雾笼罩，在日光照射下，遍山通红，宛如炉火。这里天气很热，三月间他们上山察看地形，穿着单衣还浑身流汗。
    玉门油矿今年将在吐鲁番盆地六个构造上大力钻探。
