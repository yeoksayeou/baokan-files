Xinhua News Agency: Part of the ashes of Dr. Edouard, the former leader of the Indian Medical Team to China and Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, were scattered in the Yellow River outside the east gate of Tongguan County town on the morning of the 17th, according to the deceased's will. The Sino-Indian Friendship Association telegraphed the Indo-Chinese Friendship Association on the 17th to inform them of this matter and relay it to Dr. Edouard's family.

At 7:00 a.m. on the 17th, facing the rising sun, Dr. Li Deqi, a friend of Dr. Edouard during his lifetime, held the urn containing the ashes, and, escorted by the Tongguan County Party and government leaders, solemnly scattered the ashes of the deceased into the Yellow River facing east. The ashes immediately flowed downstream.

As early as the anti-Japanese war in 1938, Dr. Edouard led the Indian Anti-Japanese Aid China Medical Team to work in Yan'an and the Jin-Southeast front lines. When Dr. Edouard revisited China last year, he unfortunately passed away in Beijing on December 1st. Before his death, the doctor left a will to scatter half of his ashes at the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna rivers according to Indian customs, and the other half in a river in the Chinese land where he had worked, to forever commemorate the friendship between the people of India and China.

When Dr. Edouard's ashes were transported from Beijing to Tongguan on May 15, Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, Chen Hansheng, Vice President, Singh, the Indian Chargé d'Affaires in China, and responsible personnel from the Ministry of Health and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, went to the Beijing Railway Station to bid farewell to the ashes of the deceased.

In order to permanently commemorate Dr. Edouard's contributions and friendship to the Chinese people, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association decided to erect a memorial to Dr. Edouard next to the tomb of Kothiwala, a member of the former Indian Medical Team to China, in the North China Martyrs Cemetery in Shijiazhuang.

　　爱德华博士的部分骨灰洒入黄河
    新华社讯　前印度援华医疗队队长、全印和平理事会副主席爱德华博士的一半骨灰，根据死者生前的遗嘱，17日早晨在潼关县城的东门外洒入黄河。中印友好协会17日已打电报把这件事通知印中友好协会，并转告爱德华博士的家属。
    17日晨七时，迎着初升的太阳，爱德华博士的生前友好李得奇医生捧着骨灰罐，在潼关县党政负责人护送下，面向东方，肃穆地将死者的骨灰洒入黄河，骨灰立即顺流而下。
    早在1938年的抗日战争期间，爱德华博士曾率领印度抗日援华医疗队到延安和晋东南前线工作。去年爱德华博士重访中国时，不幸在12月1日病逝北京。博士生前曾留下遗嘱，要把他的一半骨灰按照印度风俗洒在恒河和朱木拿河的汇合处，另一半洒在他工作过的中国土地上的一条河流中，以永远纪念印中两国人民的友谊。
    爱德华博士的骨灰5月15日由北京启运前往潼关时，中印友好协会会长丁西林、副会长陈翰笙，印度驻华临时代办辛格，以及卫生部和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的负责工作人员，曾到北京车站同死者的骨灰告别。
    为了永久纪念爱德华博士对中国人民的功迹和友谊，中印友好协会决定在石家庄华北烈士陵园内的前印度援华医疗队队员柯迪华墓旁，立爱德华博士纪念碑。
