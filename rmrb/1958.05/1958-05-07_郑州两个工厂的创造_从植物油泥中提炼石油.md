    The Creation of Two Factories in Zhengzhou
    Extracting Petroleum from Vegetable Oil Sludge
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th: The Zhengzhou Oil Factory and the Xianghua Soap Factory, after numerous experiments, have recently extracted high-quality petroleum from vegetable oil sludge.
    The suggestion of extracting petroleum from vegetable oil sludge was put forward by Tian Shaowen, a technician at the Xianghua Soap Factory. This suggestion received the active support of the factory's Party branch. The Party organizations of the Xianghua Soap Factory and the Zhengzhou Oil Factory belong to the same branch. As soon as Tian Shaowen's suggestion was made, the Party branch mobilized workers and technicians from both factories to work with Tian Shaowen to solve the technical difficulties in extraction. They first used peanut oil sludge from the Zhengzhou Oil Factory for experiments, and on April 29th, the experiment was successful, extracting forty jin of crude oil from every hundred jin of oil sludge. According to the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, they analyzed the crude oil. The results showed that gasoline accounted for 12.5%, kerosene accounted for 20%, light diesel accounted for 8.7%, medium diesel accounted for 38.75%, and the rest was asphalt and vaseline oil. Now, these two factories are also preparing to continue experiments using other vegetable oil sludge to extract petroleum.
    Oil sludge is a waste material from the oil pressing industry. It accounts for 2%-3% in soybean oil, sesame oil, and cottonseed oil, and about 0.5% in peanut oil. The three oil factories in Zhengzhou alone filter out 1,660 tons of oil sludge from oil every year. In the past, except for a small portion needed for making soap, farmers did not like to use the rest as fertilizer. If all these oil sludge were used to extract petroleum, more than 660 tons of crude oil could be extracted, which would not only increase the economic value of the oil sludge by more than nine times, but also open up a new way for the comprehensive utilization of raw materials in the oil pressing industry.

    郑州两个工厂的创造
    从植物油泥中提炼石油
    新华社郑州6日电　郑州油厂和祥华肥皂厂一起经过多次试验，最近从植物油泥中提炼出了质量很好的石油。
    用植物油泥提炼石油的建议，是祥华肥皂厂技师田绍文提出来的。这一建议得到了工厂党支部的积极支持。祥华肥皂厂和郑州油厂的党组织同属一个支部，田绍文的这个建议一提出，党支部就发动两厂工人和技术人员同田绍文一道，来解决提炼技术上的困难。他们先用郑州油厂的花生油泥进行试验，在4月29日试验成功，从每百斤油泥中提炼出原油四十斤。他们根据石油工业部规定的标准，对原油进行了分析，结果汽油占12.5％，煤油占20％，轻柴油占8.7％，中柴油占38.75％，剩下的是沥青和凡士林油。现在，这两个厂还准备继续试验用其它植物油泥来提炼石油。
    油泥是榨油工业中的废弃物资。它在豆油、芝麻油、棉籽油里占2％—3％，花生油里也有0.5％左右，仅郑州市的三个油厂，每年从油中过滤出的油泥就有一千六百六十吨。这些油泥过去除了做肥皂需要一小部分以外，其余的做肥料农民都不喜欢要。这些油泥如果全部用来提炼石油，可以提取原油六百六十多吨，不仅经济价值比油泥提高九倍多，而且还为榨油工业开辟了原材料综合利用的新门路。
