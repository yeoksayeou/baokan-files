Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th: Indonesian Army Press Officer Piengaidi announced on the 28th that Indonesian government forces had launched a large-scale mopping-up operation in the Gorontalo region of North Sulawesi, killing seventy-seven rebels. He also stated that since the army landed in the Gorontalo region on May 20th, they had seized a rebel ship weighing seventy tons and a large number of weapons.

It was announced that in Baligi, Central Sulawesi, government forces launched a mopping-up operation near the town on May 24th, killing three rebels. Baligi was recovered on May 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th: After the American criminal Pope was escorted to Jakarta and it became impossible to disguise this crime as the action of a so-called ordinary "American civilian," the US Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones, had to issue a formal statement on the 28th expressing "regret" over the incident.

The "Independent Daily" published a commentary today stating that this direct attack on the Indonesian nation is a serious crime that cannot be covered up, and it is not enough for the United States to simply express "regret."

"Indonesian News" also demanded today that Washington provide a responsible response to this matter.

    印度尼西亚政府军乘胜追击
    扫荡哥伦打洛地区叛军
    雅加达报纸要求美国就美俘事件作出交代
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处处长皮恩加迪28日宣布，印度尼西亚政府军在北苏拉威西哥伦打洛地区展开了一个大规模的扫荡战，已经打死了七十七名叛军。他还说，陆军5月20日在哥伦打洛地区登陆以后，曾经缴获了一艘重七十吨的叛军船只和一大批武器。
    据宣布，在中苏拉威西的巴里吉，政府军5月24日在这个城镇附近展开了扫荡战，打死了叛军三人。巴里吉是在5月23日收复的。
    据新华社雅加达29日电　在美国罪犯鲍普被押解到雅加达并且在不可能再把这项罪行当作所谓普通“美国平民”的行动来加以掩饰以后，美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯28日不得不发表正式声明对这个事件表示“遗憾”。
    “独立报”今天发表评论说，这种对印度尼西亚国家的直接进攻是无法掩盖的严重罪行，美国仅仅表示“遗憾”是不够的。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”今天也要求华盛顿方面对此作出负责的答复。
