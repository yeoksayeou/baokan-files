Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st - The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has formed three industrial inspection groups, which will go to Zhangye, Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi and other regions and Lanzhou and Baiyin cities on the 19th and 20th to inspect the development of local industries.

The inspection groups are composed of cadres drawn from the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Department of Industry, the Geological Bureau, the Mining Bureau, the Urban Construction Bureau, the Lanzhou Hydropower Design Institute, the Statistics Bureau, and the Planning Commission, totaling more than sixty people, led by Provincial Party Secretaries Qiang Zixiu, Jiao Shanmin, Standing Committee member Wang Yaohua and other comrades.

Before the inspection groups set off, Provincial Party Secretary Jiao Shanmin made a mobilization report to all the cadres participating in the inspection group. He said that the content of the inspection work should be both substantial and realistic. First, it is political. It is necessary to check the implementation of the general line of socialist construction of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and to check the situation of relying on the masses to vigorously develop local industries. The second is to check the measures, find advanced experiences, and grasp both ends to bring along the middle. At the same time, it is also necessary to check the energy of the leading comrades and see whether the party committee secretary personally takes charge of local industry. In the old industrial and mining enterprises, it is necessary to check the progress of the "double-anti" movement (anti-corruption, anti-waste). The method of inspection requires the use of on-site meetings to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, and to promote good experiences on the spot. Through this inspection, we must summarize the experience of the province in vigorously developing local industries in the past six months, so as to further set off a new upsurge in local industrial construction.

    总结经验掀起新高潮
    甘肃检查地方工业
    新华社兰州21日电　中共甘肃省委组成三个工业检查团，在19、20两日分别到张掖、天水、平凉、定西等专区及兰州、白银两市检查兴办地方工业的情况。
    检查团由中共甘肃省委、省工业厅、地质局、矿务局、城市建设局、兰州水电设计院、统计局、计划委员会等部门抽调的干部组成，共有六十多人，由省委书记强自修、焦善民、常务委员王耀华等同志率领。
    在检查团出发之前，省委书记焦善民向参加检查团的全体干部作了动员报告。他说，检查工作的内容要虚实并举，首先是政治，要检查贯彻执行多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的社会主义建设路线的情况，检查依靠群众大办地方工业的情况。其次是检查措施，找先进经验，抓两头带中间。同时还要检查领导同志的干劲，看党委书记是否亲自挂帅抓地方工业。在老工矿企业，要检查双反运动的进展情况。检查的方法要求采用现场会议的形式，及时发现问题、及时解决，好的经验当场推广。通过这次检查，要总结出半年来全省大办地方工业的经验，从而进一步掀起地方工业建设的新高潮。
