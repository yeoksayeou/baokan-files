　　Water-Powered Processing Plants in Every Township

　　Huanren County, Liaoning Province, is vigorously developing water-powered processing plants by utilizing water resources. Currently, 53 wooden water turbines that utilize water energy have been installed throughout the county. Every township has one to three water-powered processing plants that cost little, are highly efficient, and generate substantial income.

　　The power source for these processing plants is the year-round flowing water, which costs nothing. The water turbines are all made by local carpenters using locally produced miscellaneous wood. Each turbine costs no more than 70 yuan. In places like Yahekou, Erhucai, and Wujiajie, these water turbines are used to drive rice milling machines. This not only increases the efficiency of rice milling by more than 20 times compared to manual and animal power but also increases the rice yield by more than 20% due to the rapid and uniform rotation. These water-powered processing plants have created conditions for the construction of small hydropower stations. Currently, the county's five existing small hydropower stations have been built on the basis of water-powered processing plants, and the generators were purchased with funds accumulated by the water-powered processing plants. The Huanren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calls this "production before lighting, water power before electrification."

    乡乡都有水动力加工厂
    辽宁省桓仁县利用水力资源大力发展水动力加工厂。现在全县已安装好五十三台利用水能的木制水轮机，每个乡都有了一座到三座花钱少、效率高、收益大的水动力加工厂。
    这些加工厂的原动力都是四季长流、一钱不花的水，水轮机都是本地木匠用当地产的杂木制造的，每台造价不超过七十元。雅河口、二户采、吴家街等地用这种水轮机带动磨米机加工大米，不但比人工和畜力磨米效率提高二十多倍，而且因为转动迅速、均匀，出米率提高20％以上。这种动力加工厂为建设小型水电站创造了条件。现在全县已有的五座小型水电站就是在水动力加工厂的基础上建设起来的，发电机都是用水动力加工厂积累的资金购买的。中共桓仁县委把这叫作“先生产后照明，先水动力化后电气化”。
