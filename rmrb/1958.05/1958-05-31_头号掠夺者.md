Notes

    Top Plunderer
    The American "Newsweek" recently admitted that anti-American sentiment is growing around the world. It said that the reason foreign countries hate the United States is because the United States has a "smell of warmongering." This is still the truth. However, "Newsweek" also said that because the United States is a "top rich man," it is also easy to arouse resentment from those countries that are "not so well off economically." This is not honest. "Newsweek" dares not explain how the United States became the "top rich man." In fact, the so-called "top rich man" is just a euphemism for "top plunderer."

    头号掠夺者
    美国“新闻周刊”最近承认，世界各地的反美情绪正在增长。它说，外国所以憎恨美国，是因为美国有“好战的气味”。这还算是老实话。不过，“新闻周刊”又说，由于美国是一个“头号阔少”，所以也容易引起那些“经济不怎么宽裕”的国家的反感。这就不老实了。“新闻周刊”不敢说明美国是怎样成为“头号阔少”的。其实，所谓“头号阔少”不过是“头号掠夺者”的代名词而已。
