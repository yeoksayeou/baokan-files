Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 26th Dispatch: Faced with the grave danger of a fascist rebellion further expanding to the French mainland, all democratic and republican forces in France are urgently mobilizing, preparing to take all necessary measures to defend the republican system. Although the 25th was a Sunday and also the Feast of Pentecost, the offices of various democratic parties, social organizations, and trade unions were busy from morning till night.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a call on the 26th, demanding that workers be ready to use a general strike to counter the fascist's sinister conspiracy. It also called on workers to widely establish anti-fascist committees and hold demonstrations.

The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) convened a meeting of its Executive Committee on the evening of the 25th. After the meeting, it called on members working in government arsenals to "immediately hold meetings to discuss various possible ways to deal with the fascist offensive." The Railway Workers' Union, which participates in the CGT, announced that railway workers and railways will consistently serve the Republic. The union called on members to establish anti-fascist committees and be ready to take action to stop all attempts to incite opposition to the republican system. In addition, the Federation of Journalists' Unions participating in the CGT, as well as the French Federation of Education Workers and the Teachers' Union, issued similar calls.

The "Workers' Force" trade union and the Catholic Labor Confederation also issued separate communiqués, calling on their members to hold meetings on the 26th to mobilize everyone against the conspiracy threatening the Republic.

The left-wing minor party "Socialist Left League" issued a statement to the press on the 25th, demanding that the government immediately disband the paratrooper units, replace unreliable senior generals and officials, and organize the people's strength.

The "Committee for National Action and Defense of the Republic," organized by six "middle" parties in Parliament, also issued an appeal on the same day, asking its members to be ready to respond to unforeseen events at any time.

After the Corsica rebellion, although the French cabinet held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, announced the suspension of sea and air links with Corsica, and promulgated an order on "severely punishing" all officers and officials involved in the rebellion, it did not take any truly effective measures to oppose the increasingly rampant fascist coup conspiracy. On the contrary, news from Paris said that the compromise activities between the Pflimlin government and De Gaulle were still continuing behind the scenes.

    反击法西斯的颠覆活动
    法共号召工人准备总罢工
    劳动人民和民主党派加紧动员力量保卫共和
    据新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：面临着法西斯暴乱进一步扩大到法国本土的严重危险，法国一切民主和共和的力量正在紧急动员，准备采取一切必要的手段来保卫共和政体。尽管25日是星期日，又正逢降灵节日，但是各个民主党派、社会团体和工会的办事处从早到晚都在紧张地忙碌着。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局在26日发出号召，要求工人们随时准备用总罢工来反击法西斯的罪恶阴谋。它还号召工人们广泛成立反法西斯委员会和举行示威。
    法国总工会在25日晚上召集了执行委员会会议。会后它号召在政府兵工厂里工作的会员们“立即举行会议来讨论对付法西斯进攻的各种可能的办法”。参加总工会的铁路员工工会宣布：铁路员工和铁路将始终一贯地为共和国服务。这个工会号召会员们成立反法西斯委员会，并且随时准备采取行动来制止一切煽动反对共和政体的企图。此外，参加法国总工会的新闻工作者工会联合会以及法国教育工作者联合会和教师联合会也发出了类似的号召。
    “工人力量”总工会和天主教劳工联盟也分别发表公报，号召自己的会员在26日举行会议，以便动员大家反对威胁共和国的阴谋。
    左翼小党派“社会主义左翼联盟”25日向报界发表声明，要求政府立即解散伞兵部队、撤换不可靠的高级将领和官员，并且把人民的力量组织起来。
    由议会中六个“中间”党派组织的“民族行动和保卫共和国委员会”也在同一天发出呼吁，要求它的成员随时准备应付不测事件。
    在科西嘉暴乱事件发生后，法国内阁虽然在25日下午举行了紧急会议，宣布中断同科西嘉岛的海空联系，并且公布了一项关于将“从严惩处”一切参与暴乱的军官和官员的命令，但是，它并没有采取任何真正有效的措施来反对日益猖狂的法西斯政变阴谋。相反地，从巴黎传出的消息说，弗林姆兰政府同戴高乐之间的妥协活动仍在幕后继续进行中。
