    No Wheat in Hand, the Struggle Doesn't Stop
    The campaign to protect wheat by conquering the "three pests" of disease, insects, and waterlogging is unfolding across the rural areas of Jiangsu Province. Currently, the greatest threats to the three wheats (wheat, barley, and naked barley) are scab and stem rust. Due to the heavy rainfall in March, scab spores began to develop. In April, just when the naked barley was heading and flowering, continuous rainy weather provided an opportunity for scab to invade, and it began to occur and spread in some areas at the end of April. Stem rust has also begun to show signs in some areas. Aphids and armyworms have also been discovered. Since the end of April, the weather has been continuously rainy with insufficient sunlight, and various diseases, especially stem rust, are about to enter a period of severe harm. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels promptly held telephone conferences and broadcast rallies, issuing battle calls to mobilize the entire population to conquer the "three pests" and ensure a bumper harvest of the three wheats. The farmers in the wheat-growing areas of Jiangsu have put forward the slogan "No wheat in hand, the struggle doesn't stop" and have universally taken action, determined to win the first battle for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year.

    麦不到手　斗争不停
    战胜病、虫、雨涝“三害”的保麦斗争，正在江苏全省农村展开。当前对三麦（大小麦，元麦）威胁最大的是赤霉病和秆锈病。由于3月份雨水较多，赤霉病菌胞子开始发生，4月份正当大元麦抽穗扬花时又逢连续阴雨，赤霉病病菌乘机侵入，4月底部分地区发生和蔓延。秆锈病在部分地区也已经露了苗头。蚜虫、粘虫也有发现。4月底以来，天气又连续阴雨，日照不足，各种病害特别是秆锈病也即将进入严重危害时期。中共江苏省委和各级党委及时召开了电话会议、广播大会发出战斗号召，全民动员战胜“三害”，确保三麦大丰收。江苏麦区农民已经提出“麦不到手，斗争不停”的口号，普遍行动起来，立志打胜今年全面丰收的第一仗。　（古　平）
