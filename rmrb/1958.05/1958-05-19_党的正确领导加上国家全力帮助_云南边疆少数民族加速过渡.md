　　Correct Leadership of the Party Plus Full State Support
　　Accelerates the Transition of Ethnic Minorities in Yunnan's Border Areas

　　(Our Correspondent Huang Changlu) The ethnic minorities in Yunnan's border areas, including the Lisu, Kawa, Jingpo, Blang, Lahu, Nu, and Dulong, numbering approximately 660,000 people and existing in a primitive state, have leapt to a new stage in history as they directly transition to socialism.

　　The slash-and-burn agricultural production methods passed down through generations by these ethnic groups have been fundamentally changed. The water conservancy irrigation area developed last winter and this spring averages half a mu per person, and 160,000 mu of paddy fields have been opened up. Nearly a hundred types of advanced production tools have been learned and created. For generations, they never used fertilizer, but now tens of thousands of toilets are spread across the border regions, and this year, each household has accumulated an average of over 21,000 jin of fertilizer. More than 30,000 farm households from these ethnic groups have joined cooperatives, accounting for 29% of the total households. Many backward customs and superstitious beliefs that hindered the development of these ethnic groups have been swept away by the mass revolutionary torrent.

　　In the past few years, the state has successively allocated 5.7 million yuan in special funds to help ethnic minorities in Yunnan's border areas develop production, most of which has been distributed to ethnic minorities in directly transitioning areas to purchase agricultural tools, draught animals, seeds, and food. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, the primitive and backward farming techniques of various ethnic groups began to improve. Starting in 1954, cooperatives were established on a trial basis among some ethnic groups. By the end of last year, the number of households joining cooperatives accounted for 7% of the total households. Eighteen production and cultural stations were established successively in the Jingpo and Youle regions to unify leadership over trade, health, education, and other work to coordinate the promotion of cooperatives and production. Production among all ethnic groups has increased many times over, and some backward and exploitative factors that were detrimental to socialism and hindered production development have begun to be weakened and eliminated.

　　Last winter, encouraged and promoted by the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, the Party committees at all levels in Yunnan's border areas promptly led the masses of all ethnic groups to launch a large-scale production movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. Hundreds of thousands of people worked every day, the front line stretched for thousands of miles, red flags filled the mountains during the day, and bonfires illuminated the sky at night. The Kawa people, whose socio-economic conditions were the most backward, blew horns themselves before dawn to go to work and continued until midnight. The Jingpo people, who live on the Gaoligong Mountains, have traditionally "dawdled through the first month, dawdled through the second month, muddled through March and April, and only started working in May." This time, regardless of men, women, old, or young, all went to the construction sites, and they spent the "production labor year" on the construction sites during the New Year. This was an unprecedented feat in the border areas and created unprecedented miracles. The Kawa mountains, which previously had almost no paddy fields, opened up more than 50,000 mu of paddy fields in just over three months. Cangyuan Kawa Autonomous County opened up an average of eight fen of paddy fields per person. The large-scale opening of paddy fields triggered a series of revolutions in production technology. Land cultivation changed from rotational to fixed, from not fertilizing to fertilizing. The Kawa, Jingpo, Blang, and other ethnic groups, who previously only knew slash-and-burn agriculture, learned new production techniques such as plowing and transplanting. A large number of technical innovators emerged among various ethnic groups, learning and creating a large number of advanced production tools, opening up a broad space for the rapid development of productive forces.

　　After the production upsurge was launched, most areas simultaneously experienced a high tide of cooperativization on the basis of past pilot cooperative efforts. Under the conditions that the masses gained experience in running cooperatives through their own practical experience and leadership, the Lisu people in the Nujiang area were the first to achieve cooperativization. The number of households joining cooperatives among the Kawa people in Cangyuan and the Jingpo people in Dehong jumped from 6.5% and 12% of the total households to 48% and 36%, respectively. The Blang, Lahu, Nu, and other ethnic groups, who had fewer cooperatives in the past, also established a large number of cooperatives. The number of households joining cooperatives in the entire direct transition area jumped from 7% to 29%. The socialist economy has formed a magnificent mainstream among these ethnic groups and has taken firm root.

### 党的正确领导加上国家全力帮助  云南边疆少数民族加速过渡

　　党的正确领导加上国家全力帮助
　　云南边疆少数民族加速过渡
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：云南边疆处于原始状态的傈僳、佧佤、景颇、布朗、拉祜、怒、独龙等约有六十六万人口的少数民族在直接向社会主义过渡中，已跃进到历史上新的阶段。
    这些民族世代相传的刀耕火种的生产方式已经基本改变，去冬今春兴修的水利灌溉面积平均每人就有半亩，还开出了十六万亩水田，学习和创造了近百种先进的生产工具，他们祖祖辈辈不施肥料，现在几万个厕所遍布边疆，今年平均每户已积肥二万一千多斤；在这些民族中，已有三万多农户加入了合作社，占总户数的29％；许多束缚民族发展的落后习俗和迷信思想已被群众性的革命洪流冲破。
    过去几年中，国家陆续拨发了五百七十万元专款帮助云南边疆的少数民族发展生产，其中大部分发给直接过渡地区的少数民族购买农具、耕畜、籽种和口粮。在当地党委领导下各民族原始落后的耕作技术开始改进，从1954年起，在部分民族中试办合作社，去年底入社农户占总户数的7％。在景颇族地区和攸乐人地区先后建立了十八个生产文化站，统一领导贸易、卫生、文教等工作来配合推动办社和生产。各民族生产都成倍地增加，开始削弱和取消了一部分不利于社会主义和妨碍生产发展的落后因素和剥削因素。
    去年冬天，在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞和推动下，云南边疆各级党委即抓紧领导各族群众掀起一个以水利积肥为中心的大生产运动，每天出工几十万人，战线长达数千里，白天红旗漫山，入夜篝火映天。社会经济最落后的佧佤人早上天不亮便自己吹牛角出工，一直干到午夜。居住在高黎贡山上的景颇人自古以来是“正月晃过，二月晃过，三月四月混过，五月才把活作”，这次无论男女老幼齐上工地，过年也在工地上过“生产劳动年”。这是边疆空前的壮举，也创造出空前的奇迹。过去几乎没有水田的佧佤山上三个多月共开了水田五万多亩，沧源佧佤族自治县平均每人开了八分水田。大开水田引起生产技术上的一系列革命，耕地由轮歇变为固定，由不施肥而施肥，以前只会刀耕火种的佧佤人、景颇人、布朗人等学会了犁田、栽插等新的生产技术，各民族中涌现出大批的技术革新者，学习和创制了大量的先进生产工具，为生产力飞速发展开辟了广阔的天地。
    在生产高潮掀起之后，大部分地区同时在过去试点办社的基础上出现了合作化高潮，群众通过了自己的实践经验和领导取得了办社经验的条件下，怒江地区的傈僳族第一个实现了合作化，沧源的佧佤族与德宏的景颇族入社农户分别由占总户数的6.5％和12％跃进到48％和36％，过去办社较少的布朗、拉祜、怒等民族，也都大批建立了合作社，整个直接过渡地区入社农户由占总户数的7％跃为29％。社会主义的经济已在这些民族中形成气势磅礴的主流，扎下了坚实的根子。
