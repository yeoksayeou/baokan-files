Orienting Transportation Towards Rural Areas, Relying on the Masses to Maintain Highways
Songbu Bus Station's Outstanding Work

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, May 8th) The Songbu Automobile Center Station, by closely relying on the local Party and government leadership, and relying on the masses to maintain highways, comprehensively supported agricultural production, and strengthened and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance experience. This was greatly valued at the South China thirteen provinces and cities local transportation work symposium held in Wuhan.

The Songbu Automobile Center Station is located in Songbu Town, Macheng County, Hubei Province, and is responsible for the import and export of materials for Macheng, Hong'an, and Xinzhou counties. In the past, the station's employees lacked sufficient understanding of relying on local Party and government and the masses to manage transportation well, and their understanding of the close relationship between local transportation and agricultural production was also inadequate. As a result, some phenomena of disrespecting local Party and government leadership and being detached from the masses occurred. After the rectification campaign, the ideological awareness of the station's employees greatly improved. They regularly reported and requested instructions from the county and town Party committees. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the transportation plan, they uniformly arranged extra-plan urgent transportation tasks proposed by the local authorities according to the degree of urgency and tried their best to carry out the transportation in advance. After September of last year, the employees overcame various difficulties, and an average of twelve cars insisted on running day and night shifts every day, meeting the needs of the local temporary tasks.

During the land revolution, the old revolutionary base area of Tanshugang in Hong'an County had difficulty transporting peanuts in 1956 due to inconvenient transportation and a shortage of labor, resulting in hundreds of pounds being damaged by insects and mold. That autumn, the masses repaired the road themselves, hoping that cars could enter the mountains. Last spring, the station's employees drove cars into this mountainous area for the first time, and the local people were very happy. In October of last year, more than 300,000 catties of high-quality peanut seeds had to be transferred to other places. However, some people believed that taking this road was both fuel-consuming and laborious, and they were afraid of losing money and thought it was not worthwhile. The station's Party organization realized that this was a political task related to the future production enthusiasm of the farmers and also saw the country's need to develop oil crops. They believed that transporting these high-quality peanut seeds out was worthwhile even if it cost more gasoline. Therefore, they educated the employees and organized forces to transport them, and finally completed the transportation task ahead of schedule.

The Songbu Automobile Center Station has also established close relationships with surrounding agricultural cooperatives, farms, and farm implement repair stations. In the second half of last year alone, the maintenance workshop repaired rubber-wheeled carts, water pumps, diesel engines, etc., for farms and agricultural cooperatives more than seventy times, totaling more than two thousand work hours. The employees turned Sundays into labor days. Every Sunday, some went to the countryside carrying tools, and some stayed at the station, all busy repairing agricultural machinery for farms and agricultural cooperatives and imparting technology. The road maintenance workers living in the homes of cooperative members consciously demanded themselves according to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Army, actively helping the masses with weeding, accumulating fertilizer, pumping water, fighting drought, and gathering firewood and carrying water.

The employees' enthusiastic help and proactive concern deeply moved the agricultural cooperative members. The cooperative members took extra care of the roads. Macheng County organized more than forty mass road maintenance groups, which maintained the roads very well. The director of the Jinban Agricultural Cooperative in Pengfan Township automatically organized cooperative members to go to the road to remove the accumulated sand at the bridgeheads and on the approach roads after every flood and strong wind. After heavy snow, he also led cooperative members to sweep snow and spread sand on the road. The director of the Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative in Lisheng Township once mobilized cooperative members to contribute one hundred and sixty voluntary workdays to fill in more than 2,200 meters of roadbed, ensuring the safe passage of vehicles.

The Macheng County Party Committee and the Songbu Town Party Committee also treated the center station as one of their own working departments, strengthening their leadership over the station. When deploying work, all tasks related to both the center station and the local area were always deployed together, turning the work of the center station into the work of the broad masses. Macheng County also actively helped the center station organize freight sources and paid attention to organizing return cargo. With the help and support of all parties, the center station, which failed to complete the transportation plan in 1956, overfulfilled the transportation plan in 1957, and the vehicle integrity rate remained above 94%.

    面向农村搞运输　依靠群众养公路
    宋埠汽车站工作做得出色
    本报武汉8日电　宋埠汽车中心站紧密依靠当地党政领导，依靠群众养公路，全面支援农业生产，加强和巩固了工农联盟的经验，在南方十三省、市地方交通工作武汉座谈会上受到了重视。
    宋埠汽车中心站设在湖北省麻城县的宋埠镇，担负麻城、红安、新洲三县进口、出口物资的运输。过去，这个站的职工对依靠当地党政和群众办好交通，认识不足；对地方交通和农业生产血肉相联的关系，也认识不够清楚。因而出现了一些不尊重地方党政领导、脱离群众的现象。整风以后，这个站的职工思想觉悟大大提高，他们定期向县委、镇委汇报和请示工作，在保证完成运输计划的前提下，对地方提出计划外的紧急运输任务，都按照需要缓急统一安排，尽量进行提前运输。去年9月以后，职工克服种种困难，平均每天有十二辆汽车坚持开日夜双班，满足了地方上临时任务的需要。
    土地革命时的老根据地红安县檀树岗，因交通不便、劳动力少，1956年种的花生运不出来，虫蛀和霉烂了几百斤。这年秋天，群众自己修了路，迫切希望汽车进山。去年春天，这个站的职工第一次把汽车开进了这个山区，当地群众非常高兴。去年10月，这里又有三十多万斤花生良种要调往外地。但有些人认为走这条路既亏油又费劲，怕赔钱划不来。这个站的党组织认识到这是一个关系到农民今后生产积极性的政治任务，也看到整个国家发展油料作物的需要，认为把这些花生良种运出来，即使多费点汽油也划算。便一面教育职工，一面组织力量运输，终于提前完成了运输任务。
    宋埠汽车中心站还和周围的农业社、农场、农具修配站建立了密切的关系，仅去年下半年，保养场为农场和农业社修理胶轮马车、抽水机、柴油机等达七十多次，计两千多个工时。职工变星期天为劳动日，每到星期天，有的背着工具下乡，有的留在站上，都忙着为农场、农业社修理农业机械和传授技术。住在社员们家里的养路段的道班工人都自觉地按照人民军队的三大纪律、八项注意来要求自己，积极帮助群众锄草、积肥、车水、抗旱以及打柴、挑水等。
    职工们这种热情帮助和主动关怀，使农业社社员们非常感动。社员们对公路备加爱护。麻城县组织了四十多个群众养护公路小组，把公路养护得很好。彭畈乡金畈农业社主任每逢洪水和大风后自动组织社员上路清除桥头下、引道上的积沙，大雪后，又带领社员上路扫雪撒沙。李胜乡红星一社主任曾发动社员用一百六十个义务工，填补了二千二百多公尺的路基，保证车辆安全行驶。
    麻城县委、宋埠镇委也把中心站当成自己的一个工作部门，加强对这个站的领导。在布置工作时，凡是中心站和地方有关的工作，总是一并布置下去，使中心站的工作变成广大群众的工作。麻城县还积极帮助中心站组织货源，注意组织回头货。在各方面的帮助支持下，1956年没有完成运输计划的中心站，1957年超额完成了运输计划，汽车完好率保持在94％以上。
