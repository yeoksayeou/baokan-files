China's wheat is one of the main foods of the people. The national planting area is more than 400 million mu, accounting for 22% of the total grain area, occupying an important position in grain production. In 1954, autumn grain production was reduced due to flooding, but wheat bumper harvests made up for the losses, resulting in an overall increase in total grain output for that year.

Winter wheat is one of the main overwintering crops in China, with the characteristic of being harvested early. Winter wheat can be combined with autumn-harvested crops to increase the multiple cropping index and increase total grain output.

Wheat is widely distributed in China. From the coast of the East China Sea to the Tianshan Mountains, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, it is cultivated everywhere. From the perspective of climatic and cultivation conditions, China's wheat region can be divided into three: north of the Great Wall and west of the Liupan Mountains is the spring wheat region, with a wheat field area accounting for more than 10% of the total wheat field area; south of the Great Wall, east of the Liupan Mountains, and north of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River is the northern winter wheat region, with a wheat field area accounting for more than 60% of the total wheat field area, and is the main wheat producing area in China; south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River is the southern winter wheat region, with a wheat field area accounting for more than 20% of the total wheat field area, and is the main base of commercial wheat in China.

Although China's wheat planting area is very wide, only a dozen or so provinces have relatively concentrated wheat fields. These provinces (regions) are: Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. The wheat fields in these provinces (regions) account for about 90% of the total wheat field area in the country.

In recent years, due to agricultural cooperation and improvements in agricultural technology, wheat production levels have increased. In 1956, wheat completed the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule: the area exceeded 2.2%, the yield per unit exceeded 2%, and the total output exceeded 5%.

    我国的小麦资源
    小麦是我国人民主要粮食之一，全国播种面积四亿多亩，占粮食总面积的22％，在粮食生产中占重要地位。1954年秋粮受水灾减产，但因小麦丰收，弥补了损失，使这年的粮食总产量仍有增长。
    冬小麦是我国主要越冬作物之一，有早收特点。冬小麦可以同秋收作物配合增加复种指数，提高粮食总产量。
    我国小麦分布很广，我国从东海沿岸到天山，从黑龙江到海南岛，到处都有栽培。从气候条件和栽培条件看，我国麦区可分为三个：长城以北，六盘山以西是春麦区，麦田面积约占麦田总面积的10％以上；在长城以南，六盘山以东，秦岭、淮河以北为北方冬麦区，麦田面积占麦田总面积60％以上，是我国小麦主要产区；秦岭、淮河以南是南方冬麦区，麦田面积占麦田总面积20％以上，是我国商品小麦的主要基地。
    我国种麦区域虽然很广，但麦田比较集中的只有十几个省。这些省（区）是：河南、山东、安徽、河北、江苏、陕西、甘肃、山西、四川、湖北、黑龙江、内蒙古和新疆。这些省（区）的麦田，约占全国麦田总面积的90％左右。
    几年来，由于农业合作化和农业技术的改进，小麦生产水平有了提高，在1956年，小麦就提前超额完成第二个五年计划的指标：面积超过2.2％，单位产量超过2％，总产量超过5％。
