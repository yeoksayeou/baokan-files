Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 22nd. The Romanian "Spark" newspaper published an editorial in two consecutive days, the 18th and 20th, entitled "Commentary on the Draft Program of the Yugoslav Communist League."

The editorial stated, "After learning about the contents of the draft program, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, including our Party, clearly and unanimously expressed their differing opinions. In its letter to the Yugoslav Communist League, the Romanian Workers' Party expressed its position on the draft, pointing out that many of the arguments in the draft, such as the estimation of international relations and the world communist movement, are contrary to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, the theory and practice of the world communist movement, and the declaration of the November 1957 meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries."

It was precisely for this reason that the Romanian Workers' Party, like almost all fraternal parties, could not send a delegation to attend the Congress of the Yugoslav Communist League.

At that time, everyone wanted to wait for the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League to carefully and kindly study the criticisms of the draft raised by fraternal parties of various countries. These criticisms had conducted a profound analysis of the draft, pointing out its erroneous nature and possible adverse consequences in a calm, patient, comradely, and principled manner.

The editorial pointed out, "Although the Yugoslav Communist League made some revisions to the draft, the revisionist and anti-Marxist viewpoints in the draft were made even more prominent by the speeches of the main Yugoslav leaders at the congress. These leaders re-presented the relevant arguments and views, and made them even more acute and egregious. The criticisms of the draft raised by fraternal parties were rejected in general, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries were subjected to fierce and unjust attacks. Ranković's speech was representative in this regard."

"Of course, it would be an illusion if we thought that the fundamental differences and disagreements between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and the Yugoslav Communist League would be eliminated in a day or two. The facts have proven that although the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League have declared their willingness to develop friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, they have prepared a program that revises the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. This can only bring confusion to the cause of socialism and peace."

"Spark" then criticized some of the main arguments in the draft separately.

The first part of the editorial pointed out, "Ignoring objective facts, the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program blindly disregard the following conclusion arising from the division of the world into two systems according to the laws of social development: the fundamental contradiction between the socialist system and the capitalist system, and the necessity of solidarity among socialist countries. They regard the existence of two fundamentally different socio-political camps—the socialist camp and the capitalist camp—only as the division of the world into two opposing military-political blocs."

According to the method of sophistry, the fact that the two camps coexist is said to be the result of a position-of-strength policy. And this position-of-strength policy is said to be not only the policy implemented by the imperialist camp, but also the policy implemented by the socialist camp. How peculiar this is to anyone who can judge the issue somewhat objectively. This is obviously putting the cart before the horse, confusing cause and effect, and turning black and white upside down.

The editorial stated, "In order to defend their theory, which violates historical reality, the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program deliberately distort the historical facts of the war and completely distort the history after the war."

The editorial wrote: "In his speech at the Congress, Tito, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist League, mentioned the Tehran Conference, the Yalta Conference, and the Potsdam Conference, and said that at these conferences, the fate of other independent nations was discussed without letting the people of those nations know or agree, and that this practice was based on the principle of the power of great powers, not on the principle that all nations have the right to decide their own destiny.

"Equating the attitude taken by the Soviet Union at these historical conferences with the attitude taken by Western countries at these conferences means disregarding the most obvious historical facts. For the people of the whole world, especially for the people of all countries now building socialism, it was a happy event that the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, participated in the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam negotiations. The Soviet Union opposed the imperialist policy of dividing spheres of influence pursued by Western countries, which aimed to forcibly implement political rule and obtain economic conquest in those countries temporarily occupied by the Hitlerites. The Soviet Union used all its influence and authority to defend the democratic goals declared by the anti-fascist alliance, first and foremost the right of all nations to decide their own destiny.

"The above statement seems even more strange when one considers that the Soviet Union has always been equally attentive to defending the legitimate rights of the Yugoslav people. As everyone knows, British and American government officials had long supported the reactionary Mihailović and the royal government in exile, who attempted to forcibly change the government led by Marshal Tito. British and American imperialists attempted to ensure that elements linked to the exploiting classes and foreign imperialists prevailed in this government in order to drag Yugoslavia into their sphere of interests. The Soviet government, for the sake of Yugoslavia's free and independent development, opposed British and American attempts to interfere and issue 'absolute orders,' and supported the Yugoslav people's liberation struggle. Historical documents specifically prove that in 1945, when the United States and Britain wanted to force the Yugoslav army to withdraw from the Trieste-Istria region it had liberated, the Soviet Union firmly opposed this conspiracy. Stalin emphasized in his correspondence with Churchill that no action should be allowed that disregarded the legitimate rights of Yugoslavia and the contribution of the Yugoslav armed forces to the common cause of the Allies—fighting against Hitler's Germany."

The editorial stated, "Of course, people can forget certain facts, and can oppose history regardless of the facts, but facts are facts after all, and they cannot be denied."

"Spark" said: "The leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League interpret the emergence and development of the Cold War policy with the same lack of objective judgment." In refuting Tito's point of view on this issue, the editorial pointed out: "The people of all countries cannot and will not forget that atomic blackmail, the re-revival of West German militarism, the implementation of economic discrimination, and the policy of military blocs were initiated by the United States."

"Spark" asked: "Who ignited the flames of war in Korea, Vietnam, and Egypt? Who organized a series of conspiracies under the guise of the Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine to oppose the national liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries?"

"People will ask, why is there no mention of the fact that the American imperialist aggressive bloc is the initiator of the Cold War and the center of reactionary international imperialism and war conspiracies? Why try to shift the responsibility for international tensions from the shoulders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and distort the persistent peace policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries? We cannot but point out that this way of looking at problems has aroused strong dissatisfaction among our people."

In the second part of the editorial, "Spark" said: "Although there are declarations on proletarian internationalism in the program of the Yugoslav Communist League, its understanding of internationalism and its position on a series of major issues are contrary to Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the practice and interests of the workers' movement."

"The program of the Yugoslav Communist League not only does not strive for the unity of socialist countries, but opposes this unity and launches various attacks on the socialist camp."

"Spark" said, "Ignoring the division of the world into two opposing socio-economic systems, ignoring the fundamental contradiction between capitalism and socialism, makes the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program depart from the class position on the issue of internationalism, and they also deny that every communist should make it their task to support the socialist system throughout the world."

"Spark," in discussing the vicious attacks on the fraternal relations of socialist countries in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League and in a series of speeches at the congress, said: "The leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League cannot fail to understand that the imperialist aggressive blocs are precisely using this to slander the countries of the socialist camp, calling these countries 'satellite states' and 'countries that have lost their independence' in order to find excuses for their arrogant attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, to subvert their systems, and to undermine their independence."

The editorial stated: "The principles of equality of rights, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs are fully observed among socialist countries."

"Spark" pointed out: Among countries that are building socialism, internationalism cannot be reduced to the level of good neighborliness and commercial reciprocity between countries with different systems. With such a view of internationalism, socialist countries could not have achieved achievements that have shocked the world. Whether in times of peace or turmoil, fraternal mutual assistance should be "everyone for one, and one for everyone." This is the characteristic of the relations between countries of the socialist camp, especially between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

The editorial gave a high appraisal of the Soviet Union's internationalist policy. The editorial said: "In the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League and in the speeches of Yugoslav leaders at the congress, there are consistent attacks on socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, but there is no mention of the real danger that endangers the independence and existence of socialist countries—the aggressive policy of international imperialism headed by the United States, which is unexpected."

The third part of the editorial pointed out, "The revision of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in the program of the Yugoslav Communist League is most clearly manifested in the issues of the development of capitalism, the essence and role of the state under state-monopoly capitalism, and the transition from capitalism to socialism."

The editorial said, "The draft program abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine that the state is a tool for one class to rule another, whether it is a capitalist state or a socialist state. The draft program re-presented the old, anti-scientific, and supra-class theory of the state that had been refuted by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. What we clearly see is the idyllic beautification of the bourgeois state and the slander of the socialist state."

The editorial refuted the fallacy in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League that under state-monopoly capitalism, the bourgeois state serves both the interests of monopoly giants and the interests of workers.

In criticizing the erroneous viewpoints on the transition from capitalism to socialism in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League, the editorial said: "Communists and revolutionary workers can only treat this kind of statement with condemnation. Because these statements not only do not prompt the working people in capitalist countries to more clearly understand the revolutionary tasks before them, but on the contrary, plant harmful illusions in their minds."

The editorial said: "Under the conditions that the bourgeoisie holds political power, state capitalism does not mean 'socialism' or 'near socialism' in the slightest."

The editorial pointed out: "Life shows that in countries where political power is in the hands of the imperialist bourgeoisie, including those countries where social democratic parties controlled by reformist and revisionist ideas have been in power for a long time, no fundamental changes have taken place in the capitalist countries' mode of production and in the social class structure. The capitalists are still the capitalists and masters of production, and the workers continue to be the exploited proletarians."

The editorial believed: "In these countries, just like in any other country, socialism can only triumph by realizing the historical mission of the proletarian revolution."

The editorial then pointed out that in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League, the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat is in many places contrary to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. These arguments have long been peddled by some well-known figures of the right-wing social democrats. The editorial said: "Whether to openly and clearly recognize that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a necessary historical stage in the transition from capitalism to socialism is a touchstone for every revolutionary Marxist."

The editorial, in discussing the incorrect views in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League on the workers' movement in capitalist countries, asked: "Don't the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program know about the countless forms of persecution of the workers' movement in Britain, the ban on communist activities and the various persecutions taken in West Germany? Don't the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program know that the Communist Parties of more than thirty countries are struggling with difficulty under illegal conditions? How is it possible that in the program of a Communist Party of a country, there is not a single word against this brutality? Fraternal parties, the vanguard of the working class, are being arrested and persecuted!"

In the fourth part of the editorial, "Spark" pointed out that the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League believes that with the development of socialism, the state is increasingly becoming a "factor of stagnation and hindering social development," which is incorrect. The editorial said: "The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies are precisely contrary to this assertion of the Yugoslav Communist League. As everyone knows, socialism cannot be the result of spontaneous development." The editorial believes that the socialist state has the task of comprehensively developing the productive forces, attracting millions of small producers onto the socialist path, raising the consciousness of the masses, and opposing all backward tendencies and anti-socialist tendencies. The task of the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to defend the revolutionary fruits of the working people and to oppose enemies at home and abroad."

The editorial said that the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League affirms that in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, the state machine has a tendency to become an independent and supra-social force, which is re-presenting the reactionary theory of the supra-class state. Ignoring actual circumstances, the drafters of the program describe bureaucracy as a phenomenon inherent in the dictatorship of the proletariat, "which is essentially no different from the propaganda used by imperialism to slander the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The editorial pointed out that the issue of the socialist state raised in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League is completely contrary to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state. As everyone knows, Marx, Engels, and Lenin believed that the state is a historical product of class society, and that the elimination of classes in communism will lead to the elimination of the state. But at the same time, it is pointed out that the demise of the state will be gradually realized and will be the result of long-term development. This development process will only end at the highest stage of communist construction, when classes and class differences no longer exist, and there is no longer a need for collective and strict supervision of each person's labor and consumption. "Spark" disagreed with the accusations against Stalin in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League on this issue. And it wrote: "Stalin, in expounding the evolution of the functions of the socialist state during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, followed the basic principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat formulated by Marx, Engels, and Lenin; on the contrary, the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program truly overthrew these basic principles of Marxism." "Spark" asked: "Who is revising the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state? Isn't it those who declare that weakening the state is the central task of the transition period?"

Life itself most clearly negates the fallacy in the draft program about the demise of the state. In the socialist countries that emerged after World War II, the domestic class struggle still continues, and the imperialist blocs abroad are trying every means to undermine the people's democratic countries. At this time, if one begins to weaken the socialist state, "it will only please the imperialists." Because in this way, "we will easily become their prey." The editorial emphasized: "The experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries shows that during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, and even in socialist society, there is no question of weakening the socialist state. During this period, the state has both the function of suppressing the resistance of internal enemies to the new system and the function of defending the state from imperialist aggression, as well as the organizational function in the economic sphere and the educational function in the cultural sphere. After the victory of socialism, on the basis of the elimination of the exploiting classes, the function of suppressing internal enemies is gradually reduced, because it is limited to dealing with imperialist agents, while the organizational function in the economic sphere becomes increasingly important with the progress made in building socialism and communism. The function of militarily defending the country from foreign aggression is fully retained. If the danger of imperialist military offensive has been eliminated, this latter function will disappear in the communist era."

The editorial said: "Our task is not to deprive the socialist state of its organizational function in the economic sphere, but on the contrary, to develop this function, to make it more perfect, and to increasingly and widely absorb the masses to participate in the leadership of public affairs. Therefore, it is unfounded and incompatible with Marxism-Leninism to view the development of socialist democracy as opposed to the development of the socialist state, and to find forms of public leadership of the economy outside and opposed to the state at any cost."

The editorial criticized the statement in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League about reducing the leading role of the Party. The editorial pointed out: "Contrary to the statements of the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program, in the process of transition from capitalism to socialism, the state machine and state organs must never become independent things; they can only either serve the interests of the working class or become tools of forces hostile to socialism. The guarantee that the state realizes the policies required by the interests of the working class is the Party's leadership over the state. This role not only does not gradually decrease, but on the contrary, will gradually strengthen as the masses increasingly and widely participate in the leadership of public affairs. Without the role of the Party as the leading force of the people and the country, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot have a practical nature."

The editorial felt very strange about the program's avoidance of mentioning the common laws in revolution and socialist construction, and its confinement to talking about some individual characteristics. In the last part of the editorial, "Spark" pointed out: "Developing close cooperative and fraternal relations between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and strengthening their unity on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought and proletarian internationalism has played a huge role in leading the modern world towards socialism." "But the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League insists that there is a tendency of subordination in this relationship, that there is so-called 'ideological monopoly' and 'political hegemony' within the international communist movement, and denies the necessity for the international workers' movement to have a center. This position, in fact, contradicts the strengthening of the unity of the communist movement."

The editorial continued: "The Moscow Conference held in November 1957 showed that these fraternal cooperative relations were established on a completely equal basis, and the declaration adopted was the result of a broad and fruitful exchange of views. In the process of exchanging views, the delegations participating in the meeting expressed their opinions very freely and frankly, and everyone made their own contribution to the talks on the basis of equal rights. But the representatives of the Yugoslav Communist League refused the invitation and were unwilling to participate in this discussion."

The editorial pointed out: "Everyone knows what happened later. The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries adopted the declaration, and it was supported by more than 30 million party members and hundreds of millions of people. But the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League used their own program to confront it, putting forward a whole set of arguments that completely contradict Marxism-Leninism and modern historical facts."

"Spark" condemned the actions of the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League in interfering in the internal lives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of other countries. The editorial said that it is not the first time that Yugoslav leaders have lectured and issued instructions to the world communist and workers' movement, and have expressed opinions on the internal problems of other countries and other parties. The Communist Parties of various countries have very firmly pointed out that the demand to make the "new policy pioneered by Yugoslavia" win in the communist movement is not permissible.

The editorial advised the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League to be a little more modest when talking about their own experiences. The editorial said: "In our opinion, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League should be less subjective and pay more attention to grasping the sense of proportion when estimating the international nature of their experiences." The editorial also criticized the disrespect for the Communist Parties of various countries shown in the program of the Yugoslav Communist League.

"Spark" said that the drafters of the Yugoslav Communist League program insist that Marxist thought has fallen behind the current development of socialism. But just when Marxist-Leninist doctrine has won great prestige all over the world, just when Marxist-Leninist thought has guided the workers' revolutionary movement to achieve epoch-making victories, just when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in the world are carrying out unprecedented creative activities and making huge contributions to scientific Marxism-Leninism, how can one insist on this statement? Is it possible to deny all this, and is creatively developing Marxism-Leninism just the "monopoly" of the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League?

The editorial said that it can be seen from the entire content of the draft program that they are attacking the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and the international unity of the Communist Parties of various countries under the guise of opposing dogmatism.

The editorial believes that the large-scale competition between socialism and capitalism in the world is the characteristic of our era. In view of the growth of socialist forces and peace forces, the imperialist reactionary bloc, especially the American imperialist reactionary bloc, has launched a rampant offensive to weaken the strength of the socialist camp and undermine the unity of the international communist movement. Under these circumstances, the sacred duty of the Communist Party is to criticize revisionism and nationalistic remnants, and to strengthen the unity of socialist countries and the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries.

The editorial said, "Ideologically, the program of the Yugoslav Communist League is a revisionist program."

Many of the arguments in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League are in the same vein as the arguments of old revisionists such as Bernstein and Kautsky. Therefore, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League cannot blame the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries for their criticism of their draft program.

The editorial believed: "The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries cannot but take a firm stand on such a draft program, and they believe that making a public criticism of this draft program is not only an obligation that they owe to the working class in their own countries, but also an obligation that they owe to the Yugoslav Communist League and its leaders."

The editorial said, "The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries have made unremitting efforts to develop and improve cooperative relations with the Yugoslav Communist League. They believed that this position would be correctly assessed by the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League, and that through common efforts, the points of disagreement would gradually be eliminated on the basis of Marxism-Leninism."

"In the face of this fact, the claim of the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League that Yugoslavia is 'isolated' is without any basis. The fact that the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist League themselves have currently taken a position inconsistent with the entire communist movement should not be the responsibility of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries." The editorial concluded: "Marxist-Leninist thought and the principles of proletarian internationalism are the solid foundation of the unity between the Communist Parties and socialist countries. Our Party has been, and will continue to work hard to further strengthen the unity of the communist and workers' movement, and to strengthen the unity of all socialist countries."

    罗马尼亚“火花报”社论指出
    南共纲领完全违反马列主义和现代史实
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”在18日和20日两天连续发表了题为“评南共纲领草案”的社论。
    社论说，“各国共产党和工人党，其中包括我党，在知道了纲领草案的内容以后，明确和一致地表明了自己的不同意见。罗马尼亚工人党在给南共的信件中表示了它对草案的立场，指出草案中的许多论点，如对国际关系和对世界共产主义运动问题的估计，都是同马克思列宁主义基本原则、同世界共产主义的理论和实践、同1957年11月社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言相违背的。”
    正因为这样，罗马尼亚工人党和几乎所有的兄弟党一样，就不能派代表团参加南共代表大会。
    当时大家总想等待南共领导人仔细和善意地研究各国兄弟党对草案所提出的批评意见。这些批评意见都曾对草案进行了深刻的分析，冷静、耐心、同志式地和有原则性地指出草案的错误性质以及可能产生的不良后果。
    社论指出，“尽管南共对草案作了某些修改，但是草案中的修正主义和反马克思主义的观点，却通过南斯拉夫主要领导人在大会上的讲话而显得更为突出，这些领导人重新提出了有关的论点和看法，并且把它们讲得更加尖锐和恶劣。各兄弟党对草案提出的批评意见被笼统地拒绝了，各国共产党和工人党受到了猛烈的和不正当的攻击。兰科维奇的讲话在这方面具有代表性。”
    “当然，如果我们以为各国共产党和工人党同南共之间的基本分歧和不同看法会在一两天内就消除，这将是幻想。事实证明，尽管南共领导人曾经声明愿意在马克思列宁主义基础上发展友好和合作关系，可是他们准备了一个修正马克思列宁主义基本原则的纲领。这只能给社会主义和和平事业带来混乱。”
    “火花报”接着对草案中的一些主要论点分别作了批判。
    社论的第一部分指出，“南共纲领起草人，不顾客观事实，一味无视按照社会发展规律，世界分裂为两个体系所产生的下述结论：社会主义体系同资本主义体系之间的基本矛盾和社会主义国家团结的必要性。他们把存在着两个基本不同的社会政治阵营——社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营——只看成是世界分裂为两个对立的军事政治集团。”
    根据诡辩的方法，两个阵营共存这一事实，被说成是由于实力地位政策的结果。而这种实力地位政策又被说成不但是帝国主义阵营所实行的政策，而且也是社会主义阵营所实行的政策。这对任何一个多少能客观地判断问题的人来说是多么的奇特。这显然是本末倒置、因果不清和颠倒黑白。
    社论说，“为了替他们的违背历史实际的理论辩护，南共纲领起草人有意地曲解了战时的历史事实，并且完全歪曲了战后的历史。”
    社论写道：“南共中央总书记铁托在代表大会上发表的演说中提到德黑兰会议、雅尔塔会议和波茨坦会议，并且说，在这些会议上曾经在既不让其他独立国家人民知道，也没有经过他们同意的情况下讨论他们的命运，并且说，这种做法所依据的是大国力量的原则，而不是所有国家人民都有权决定自己命运的原则。
    “把苏联在这些历史性的会议上采取的态度和西方国家在这些会议上采取的态度等同起来意味着毫不考虑最明显的历史事实。对于全世界人民、首先是对现在正在建设社会主义的各国人民来说，有伟大的社会主义国家苏联参加德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨坦谈判是一件喜事。苏联反对西方国家所推行的目的在于在那些暂时被希特勒分子占领的国家里强制实行政治统治和取得经济征服的地位的帝国主义划分势力范围的政策，苏联利用了它的一切影响和权威来保卫反法西斯联盟所宣布的民主目的，首先是一切民族决定自己命运的权利。
    “当人们考虑到苏联曾经同样坚定地注意保卫过南斯拉夫人民的合法权利的时候，上面的那种说法就显得更加奇怪了。大家知道，英美政府人士曾经长期支持反动的米哈洛维奇和流亡在外的王家政府，它们企图强行改变铁托元帅所领导的政府。英美帝国主义者试图保证使同剥削阶级和外国帝国主义者有联系的分子在这个政府里占上风，以便把南斯拉夫拖进它们的利益范围。苏联政府为了南斯拉夫的自由、独立的发展，曾经反对英美进行干涉和发布‘绝对命令’的尝试，支持南斯拉夫人民的解放斗争。历史文件特别证明，1945年美国和英国要想强迫南斯拉夫军队退出他们所解放的亚里雅斯特—伊斯特里地区，苏联坚决反对了这个阴谋。斯大林在他同丘吉尔的通讯中强调说明，决不应该允许有任何不考虑南斯拉夫的合法权利和南斯拉夫武装部队对盟国的共同事业——对希特勒德国作战——所作的贡献的行动。”
    社论说，“当然，人们可以忘掉某些事实，可以不顾事实地反对历史，但事实终究是事实，它们是否认不掉的。”
    “火花报”说：“南共领导人以同样缺乏客观判断的精神来解释冷战政策的产生和发展过程。”社论在驳斥铁托对这一问题所持的论点时指出：“各国人民，过去不能、现在也不能忘记原子讹诈、重新复活西德军国主义、实行经济歧视和军事集团政策正是由美国倡议的。”
    “火花报”问道：“是谁燃起了朝鲜、越南和埃及的战火？是谁在杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义的幌子下组织了一系列的阴谋活动来反对殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动呢？”
    “人们会问，为什么丝毫也没提到美国帝国主义侵略集团是冷战的倡议者，是反动的国际帝国主义和战争阴谋的中心这一事实呢？为什么要企图把国际紧张局势的责任从北大西洋公约集团的肩上卸下来，并对苏联和其他社会主义国家的坚持不渝的和平政策进行歪曲？我们不能不指出，这种看问题的方法在我国人民中引起了强烈的不满。”
    “火花报”在社论的第二部分中说：“虽然在南共纲领中有关于无产阶级国际主义的声明，但是它对国际主义的理解，对一系列主要问题的立场，都是同马克思列宁主义学说、同工人运动的实践和利益相违背的。”
    “南共纲领不仅没有为社会主义国家的团结而奋斗，反而反对这种团结，对社会主义阵营进行各种攻击。”
    “火花报”说，“无视世界分裂为两个对立的社会经济制度，无视资本主义与社会主义之间的根本矛盾，就使得南共纲领起草人在国际主义的问题上离开了阶级立场，他们也就否认每个共产主义者应把支持全世界的社会主义制度作为自己的任务。”
    “火花报”在谈到南共纲领草案以及在代表大会上的一系列发言对社会主义国家的兄弟关系进行恶毒攻击时说：“南共领导人不会不懂得，帝国主义侵略集团，正是这样来诬蔑社会主义阵营各国的，他们把这些国家说成是‘卫星国’、‘失去独立的国家’，以此来为他们干涉这些国家内政的狂妄企图寻找借口，以此来颠覆这些国家的制度，破坏它们的独立。”
    社论说：“在社会主义国家之间、权利平等、尊重国家独立和主权、不干涉他国内政的几项原则是被充分遵守着的。”
    “火花报”指出：在正在建设社会主义的各国之间，国际主义不能被降低到不同制度国家之间互为睦邻和商业互惠的水平。以这样的观点来了解国际主义，社会主义国家就不可能有震惊世界的成就。无论在和平时期或动荡时期，兄弟般的互助都应该是“大家为一人，一人为大家”。这就是社会主义阵营国家之间，特别是苏联和人民民主国家之间关系的特点。
    社论对苏联的国际主义政策给予了很高的评价。社论说：“在南共纲领草案和南斯拉夫领导人在代表大会上的发言中，一致攻击社会主义国家，特别是苏联，但是却避而不谈危及社会主义国家的独立和存在的真正危险——以美国为首的国际帝国主义的侵略政策，这是令人意料不到的。”
    社论的第三部分指出，“南共纲领中对于马克思列宁主义基本原理的修正最明显地表现在关于资本主义的发展、关于在国家垄断资本主义条件下国家的本质和作用、关于资本主义向社会主义的过渡等问题上。”
    社论说，“纲领草案背弃了马克思列宁主义关于国家是作为一个阶级统治另一个阶级的工具的学说，无论资本主义国家、还是社会主义国家都是这样。纲领草案又重新提出了当时曾经被马克思、恩格斯、列宁所驳斥过的、旧的、反科学的、超阶级的国家论。我们清楚地看到的是对于资产阶级国家的田园诗式的美化和对于社会主义国家的诽谤”。
    社论驳斥了南共纲领草案中所谓在国家垄断资本主义条件下，资产阶级国家既为垄断巨头的利益服务、也为工人利益服务的谬论。
    社论在批判南共纲领草案中关于从资本主义向社会主义过渡的错误论点时说：“共产主义者，革命的工人只能以谴责来对待这种说法。因为这些说法不但不能促使资本主义国家的劳动人民更清楚地认识到摆在他们面前的革命任务，相反地，在他们的脑子里种下了有害的空想。”
    社论说：“在资产阶级掌握政权的条件下，国家资本主义丝毫也不意味着‘社会主义’或者‘接近社会主义’。”
    社论指出：“生活表明，在政权掌握在帝国主义资产阶级手里的国家里，包括那些被改良主义和修正主义思想控制的社会民主党长期执政的国家在内，在资本主义国家的生产方式上和在社会阶级结构上，没有发生过任何一种根本改变。资本家仍旧是资本家和生产的主人，工人继续是被剥削的无产者”。
    社论认为：“在这些国家，就像在任何其他国家一样，只有通过实现无产阶级革命的历史使命，社会主义才能胜利。”
    社论接着指出，在南共纲领草案中关于无产阶级专政问题在很多地方都是与马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说相违背的。这些论点是右翼社会民主党的一些著名人物早已贩卖过的。社论说：“是否公开明确地承认无产阶级专政是从资本主义向社会主义过渡的必要历史阶段，对每一个革命的马克思主义者都是一块试金石”。
    社论在谈到南共纲领草案对资本主义国家工人运动的不正确看法时问道：“南共纲领起草人，难道不知道英国的数不胜数的迫害工人运动的形式，西德禁止共产党活动和所采取的种种迫害么？南共纲领起草人难道不知道有三十多个国家的共产党在非法的情况下困难地进行着斗争吗？在一个国家的共产党纲领中竟没有说一句反对这种暴行的话，怎么是可能的呢？兄弟党、工人阶级的先锋战士是在被逮捕和受着迫害啊！”
    “火花报”在社论的第四部分指出，南共纲领草案认为，随着社会主义的发展，国家日益成为“停滞和妨碍社会发展的因素”，这个论点是不正确的。社论说：“马克思列宁主义的学说，苏联和人民民主国家的经验都同南共这种论断恰好相反。大家知道，社会主义不可能是自流发展的结果”。社论认为，社会主义国家负有这样的任务，即全面发展生产力，把千百万小生产者吸引上社会主义轨道，提高群众的觉悟和反对一切落后倾向及反社会主义的倾向。无产阶级专政的国家的任务，在于保卫劳动人民的革命果实，反对国内外敌人。”
    社论说，南共纲领草案肯定，在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，国家机器有变成独立和超社会力量的倾向，这就是重新提出了超阶级国家的反动理论。纲领起草人毫不顾实际情况，把官僚主义说成是无产阶级专政所固有的现象，“这在本质上与帝国主义利用这点来诽谤无产阶级专政的宣传没有什么区别”。
    社论指出，南共纲领草案中所提出的社会主义国家问题，是同马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说完全相违背的。大家知道，马克思、恩格斯、列宁曾认为，国家是阶级社会的历史产物，认为共产主义中阶级的消灭将导致国家的消灭。但同时指出，国家的消亡将是逐渐实现的，将是长期发展的结果。这个发展过程只有到共产主义建设的最高阶段，当阶级和阶级差别已不再存在，已不再需要对每个人的劳动和消费量进行集体的严格监督时才宣告结束。“火花报”不同意南共纲领草案在这个问题上对斯大林的指责。并写道：“斯大林在阐明从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的社会主义国家职能的演变问题时，是遵循了马克思、恩格斯、列宁所制定的关于无产阶级专政的基本原则的；相反，南共纲领起草人才真正推翻了马克思主义的这些基本原则。”“火花报”问道：“是谁在修改马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说呢？难道不是宣布把削弱国家作为过渡时期的中心任务的那些人吗？”
  生活本身最明确地否定了纲领草案中的关于国家消亡的谬论。在第二次世界大战后出现的社会主义国家中，国内的阶级斗争还继续存在，国外的帝国主义集团想尽办法破坏人民民主国家。在这个时候，如果开始削弱社会主义的国家，“将只能使帝国主义者感到高兴”。因为这样，“我们就很容易成为他们的猎获物”。社论强调指出：“苏联和其他社会主义国家的社会主义建设经验表明，在资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，甚至在社会主义社会里，都丝毫谈不到削弱社会主义国家。在这个时期，国家既具有镇压内部敌人对新制度的反抗的职能和保卫国家不受帝国主义侵略的职能，又有经济方面的组织职能和文化方面的教育职能。在社会主义胜利后，在剥削阶级消灭的基础上，镇压内部敌人的职能就逐渐缩小，因为它只限于对付帝国主义特务，而经济方面的组织职能则随着在建设社会主义和共产主义道路上取得的进展而变得愈来愈重要。在军事上保卫国家不受外来侵略的职能是完全保留着的。如果帝国主义军事进攻的危险已经消除，后面这一职能到了共产主义时代就会消失。”
    社论说：“我们的任务不是要剥夺社会主义国家的经济方面的组织职能，而相反的是要发展这种职能，使它更完善，日益广泛地吸收群众参加对公共事务的领导。因此，把发展社会主义民主和发展社会主义国家对立起来看待，不惜以任何代价来寻找国家以外的、和国家对立的公共领导经济的形式的倾向是没有根据的，是与马克思列宁主义格格不入的。”
    社论批判了纲领草案中对降低党的领导作用的说法。社论指出：“与南共纲领起草人的说法相反，在从资本主义向社会主义的过渡过程中，国家机器和国家机构绝不能成为独立的东西，它们只能或者为工人阶级的利益服务，或者成为社会主义敌对力量的工具。使国家实现工人阶级利益所要求的政策的保证就是党对国家的领导。这一作用不仅不日益降低，相反，将随着群众日益广泛参加对公共事务的领导而逐渐加强。没有作为人民和国家的领导力量的党的作用，无产阶级专政就不可能具有实际的性质。”
    社论对纲领避而不谈革命和社会主义建设中的共同规律，而只局限于谈一些个别特点，感到非常奇怪。“火花报”在社论最后一部分指出：“在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义的基础上，发展各国共产党和工人党之间的密切合作的兄弟般的关系，加强它们之间的团结，对使现代世界走向社会主义起了巨大的作用。”“但南共纲领草案硬说，在这一关系中有从属倾向，在国际共产主义内部有所谓‘思想垄断’和‘政治霸权’，并且否认国际工人运动应当有一个中心的必要性。这种立场，事实上是同加强共产主义运动的团结相矛盾的。”
    社论继续说：“1957年11月召开的莫斯科会议，表明了这些兄弟般的合作关系是建立在完全平等的基础上的，所通过的宣言是广泛地卓有成效地交换意见的结果。在交换意见的过程中，参加会议的各代表团，十分自由而坦率地表达了自己的意见，大家都在权利平等的基础上对会谈作出了自己的贡献。而南共的代表们却拒绝邀请，不愿参加这次讨论。”
    社论指出：“大家都知道后来的情况，各国共产党和工人党通过了宣言，并受到三千多万党员和数亿人民的支持。而南共的领导人却用自己的纲领来和它相对抗，提出了整套同马克思列宁主义和现代历史事实完全相矛盾的论点。”
    “火花报”谴责了南共领导人干涉其他国家的共产党和工人党的内部生活的行为。社论说，南斯拉夫领导人给世界共产主义和工人运动上课、发指示，并就他国和他党的内部问题发表意见，这并不是第一次。各国共产党已经十分坚定地指出，想使“南斯拉夫首创的新方针”在共产主义运动中得胜的那种要求是不能被容许的。
    社论劝告南共领导人在谈自己的经验时放谦虚一点。社论说：“在我们看来，南共领导人在估计他们经验的国际性时，应该少主观一点，多注意掌握分寸。”社论还批评了南共纲领中所表现的对各国共产党的不尊重行为。
    “火花报”说，南共纲领起草人硬说，马克思主义思想已落后于当前社会主义的发展。但是正当马克思列宁主义学说已经在全世界赢得了巨大威望，正当马克思列宁主义思想已经引导工人革命运动取得了划时代的胜利，正当苏联共产党、中国共产党和世界各国共产党及工人党进行空前未有的创造性的活动，对科学的马克思列宁主义作出巨大贡献的时候，怎么能坚持这种说法呢？难道能否认这一切，而创造性地发展马克思列宁主义只是南共领导人的“垄断品”吗？
    社论说，从纲领草案的整个内容中可以看出，他们是在反对教条主义的幌子下，来攻击马克思列宁主义的基础和各国共产党的国际团结。
    社论认为，社会主义和资本主义之间在世界上所进行的规模巨大的竞赛，是我们时代的特点。鉴于社会主义力量和和平力量的增长，帝国主义反动集团，首先是美帝国主义反动集团，展开了猖狂的进攻，以削弱社会主义阵营的力量，破坏国际共产主义运动的团结。在这种情况下，共产党的神圣职责就是要批判修正主义、民族主义残余，加强社会主义国家的团结和各国共产党和工人党的团结。
    社论说，“从思想上看，南共纲领是一个修正主义的纲领。”
    南共纲领草案中的许多论点是和伯恩斯坦、考茨基这样一些老修正主义者的论点一脉相通的，因此，南共领导人不能责怪各国共产党和工人党对他们的纲领草案的批判。
    社论认为：“各国共产党和工人党不能不对这样一个纲领草案采取坚定的立场，而且它们认为，对这一纲领草案作公开的批判不但是他们对自己国家的工人阶级应尽的义务，而且也是对南共及其领导人应尽的义务。”
    社论说，“各国共产党和工人党曾进行了坚持不懈的努力，以发展和改善同南共的合作关系。它们以为这种立场将受到南共领导人的正确估价，并以为通过共同的努力，分歧点将在马克思列宁主义基础上逐渐消除。”
    “在这一事实面前，南共领导人的所谓‘孤立’南斯拉夫的说法是没有任何根据的。目前南共领导人自己采取了同整个共产主义运动不一致的立场这一事实，不应由各国共产党和工人党负责。”社论最后指出：“马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则是各国共产党和社会主义国家之间团结的坚实基础。我党曾经、并且将继续努力进一步加强共产主义和工人运动的团结，加强所有社会主义国家的团结。”
