　　“Hunger Has Not Abated!”
　　Large Numbers of American Workers Hold Anti-Unemployment Demonstrations
　　American Newspapers Believe the American Economic Crisis Continues to Develop
　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th, New York dispatch: Under the threat of economic crisis, unemployment and hunger, the broad masses of American workers are rising up to fight against unemployment and strive for the right to live.
　　In Springfield, the capital of Illinois, more than a thousand members of the United Automobile Workers held a meeting yesterday demanding that the local legislature immediately convene a special session to deal with the unemployment problem. These workers then held a demonstration, their signs reading: "Eisenhower says now is the time to buy things. Tell us what to buy with," "Hunger has not abated, we cannot fill our stomachs with (government) promises!"
　　The demonstrators posted signs in front of Governor Stratton's gate and demanded that he come out to meet the workers. But Stratton was not at home, and his representative, Labor Commissioner Cummins, met with the workers. Cummins gave these suffering workers a long lecture on the harm of overestimating the severity of the economic crisis and taking hasty measures. His words were repeatedly interrupted by the angry demonstrators. When Cummins said that "the economic recession has bottomed out or is about to bottom out," a chorus of ridicule arose from the demonstrators.
　　Similar events occurred in Michigan a few days ago. Four thousand unemployed workers from Detroit and other industrial cities in Michigan held a rally in Lansing, the state capital. They put forward demands such as increasing unemployment benefits, deferring debts, and building public works to increase employment. They sent a delegation to the state capitol to negotiate with state legislators, but the heavy doors of the House and Senate were tightly closed. The legislators, who were in session, were afraid to meet face-to-face with the unemployed and hurriedly adjourned the meeting and ran away. Later, newspapers reported that most of the legislators went to a suburban club for a banquet, as "guests" of Todd, a broker for "Chrysler Motors."
　　Mass actions against unemployment have also taken place in other cities.
　　Regarding examples of American workers opposing the deterioration of living conditions: the CIO organization in Cook County, Chicago, passed a program of action calling on all trade unions to fight together against unemployment. The Chicago area meatpacking workers' union demanded that political action and various forms of mass activity be used to improve the lives of unemployed workers. Trade union organizations in many states have recently sent delegations to visit members of Congress, demanding that they take prompt measures to solve the increasingly serious unemployment problem, and so on.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, New York dispatch: Despite the U.S. official's best efforts to reassure people, opinions from all sides in the United States still believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to deteriorate.
　　The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on April 29 that the number of unemployed in the United States in April was 5.12 million, a decrease of 78,000 from March. This news did not cause jubilation in the American bourgeois press, but aroused some suspicion. Because according to convention, the unemployment figures for each month are jointly released by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor in the middle of the following month, but this time the Department of Commerce exceptionally released them separately and in advance.
　　At a press conference on April 30, U.S. President Eisenhower continued to gloss over reality on the one hand, insisting that the economic recession "is easing," but when asked if he thought the decrease of 78,000 unemployed in April meant that the economic situation was improving, he did not dare to give a definite answer.
　　Temple, the vice president of the First National City Bank of New York, said at the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on April 30 that "the view that the economy is about to enter the final stage of recession must still be based on belief rather than on clear facts, because in the current news, there is nothing to indicate that the recession has been stopped."
　　Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, emphasized that the recession has not bottomed out and is continuing to worsen.
　　"U.S. News & World Report" magazine analyzed in its May 2 issue that if seasonal factors are put aside, then it can be seen that the downward trend is continuing. Steel production is still less than half of its production capacity, and automobile production is being further reduced because sales are slow; at the same time, the recession, coupled with rising prices, has reduced the total purchasing power of American residents, so it cannot be concluded that the recession has bottomed out.

### “饥饿并没有缓和下来！”  美广大工人举行反失业示威  美报认为美国经济危机在继续发展

    “饥饿并没有缓和下来！”
    美广大工人举行反失业示威
    美报认为美国经济危机在继续发展
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：在经济危机、失业和饥饿的威胁下，美国广大工人群众正在奋起为反对失业、争取生活权利而斗争。
    在伊利诺斯州首府斯普林菲尔德，昨天有一千多名汽车工人工会会员举行了集会，要求地方议会立即召开特别会议来对付失业问题。这些工人接着举行了示威游行，他们的标语上写着：“艾森豪威尔说现在应该买东西。告诉我们用什么来买”“饥饿并没有缓和下来，我们不能靠（政府的）诺言来充饥！”
    游行的人在州长斯特拉顿的大门前贴上标语，并且要求他出来见工人。但是斯特拉顿不在家，他的代表劳工局长柯明斯接见了工人。柯明斯对这些深受痛苦的工人大讲什么过高估计经济危机严重性和匆忙采取措施的害处，他的话多次被示威工人愤怒地打断。当柯明斯说到“经济衰退已经到底或者快要到底”时，示威群众中响起了一片嘲笑声。
    前些日子在密执安州也发生过类似事件。底特律市和密执安州其他工业城市的四千名失业工人在州首府兰星举行了集会。他们提出了增加失业救济金、债务延期和兴建公共工程以增加就业等要求。他们派了一个代表团前往州府大楼，想同州议会议员谈判，但是众议院和参议院的沉重的大门紧闭着。正在开会的议员害怕同失业者面对面地会见，便匆忙地停止了会议跑掉了。后来据报纸报道，大多数议员跑到市郊俱乐部去赴宴，到“克莱斯勒汽车公司”的经纪人托德那里作“客”去了。
    在其他一些城市也有反失业的群众行动。
    关于美国工人反对生活恶化的事例还有：芝加哥地区柯克县的产联组织通过了一个行动纲领，号召各工会共同为反失业而斗争。芝加哥地区的屠宰工人工会要求通过政治行动和各种形式的群众活动来改善失业工人的生活。许多州的工会组织最近派出代表团访问国会议员，要求迅速采取措施来解决日益严重的失业问题等等。
    据新华社3日讯　纽约消息：尽管美国官方竭力设法安慰人心，美国各方面舆论仍然认为美国经济还在继续恶化中。
    美国商务部4月29日宣布，美国4月份的失业人数是五百十二万人，比3月份减少了七万八千人。这个消息并没有引起美国资产阶级报刊的欢跃，却引起了一些怀疑。因为按照惯例，每一个月的失业数字都是由美国商务部和劳工部在下一个月的月中联合发表的，而这次却例外地由商务部单独提前发表。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔4月30日在记者招待会上一方面继续粉饰现实，硬说经济衰退“正在缓和下来”，但是当有人问他是否认为4月份失业人数减少七万八千人意味着经济情况正在好转时，他也不敢作肯定的回答。
    纽约第一花旗银行副总经理坦普耳4月30日在美国商会年会上说，“认为经济即将进入衰退的最后阶段的看法一定仍然是根据信念而不是根据清楚的事实得出的，因为在目前的消息中，没有什么能够说明衰退已经被制止”。
    “劳联—产联”的主席米尼强调说，衰退还没有到底，它正在继续恶化着。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在5月2日一期中分析说，如果撇开季节性的因素，那么可以看出下降的趋势仍在继续着。钢产量仍然不到生产能力的一半，汽车产量正在进一步缩减，因为销售很慢；同时，衰退再加上上涨着的物价，已经使得美国居民的全部购买力下降，因此不能作出结论，认为衰退已经到底。
