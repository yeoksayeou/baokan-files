    Chair
    Yan Yizhong, worker at Shijingshan Power Plant
    After dinner, Wu Xicai and I went to attend the propaganda worker meeting. The conference room was full, leaving only a small stool empty. I took the lead and happily sat down comfortably. These past two days, I've been spinning around the furnace like a top to catch up with the advanced workers, and my legs are a bit sore. It's okay at work, watching the fiery red furnace and the dancing flames, which make my heart jump too; plus, the indicators are getting closer and closer to the most advanced benchmark, so I forget the leg pain. After work, my feet feel like stones, too clumsy to walk. I was so happy to be able to sit for a while. I put my right leg on my left leg and said in a victorious tone, "Little Wu, come on, let's sit together." I moved out a corner, thinking, you always snatch seats, don't you? Today I snatched it first. If you weren't honest today, I wouldn't let you, no matter what. I looked at him, and he smiled at me. I went from being puzzled and strange to astonished and ashamed.
    Just as I was contemplating and feeling ashamed, the chairman of the labor union spoke: "Propaganda workers, let's compete in enthusiasm, in the spirit of being advanced. The atmosphere of learning from the benchmark and from the hardworking veteran masters is everywhere. Let me give you an example: Wu Xicai, the young stoker of the high-pressure furnace, used to sit for six hours out of eight; now it's all changed, he doesn't even stick his butt to the chair for eight hours a shift. He wanted to hand in his chair a few days ago, what kind of spirit is this? With this spirit, the combustibles in the ash have dropped from 20% to 8%, only 2% away from the benchmark. I say, propaganda worker comrades, we must also show some enthusiasm and keep up..."
    I understood. When I was helping Little Wu back to the dormitory after the meeting, I said, "Little Wu, that was meaningful." Little Wu said shyly, "It's nothing. Master Liu has been working for decades, and he still keeps turning around the furnace, his legs are like cast iron, he doesn't know what tired is, the chair has become a decoration, he doesn't even lean on it. Who is he doing it for! Our skills are not good, if we don't put in more effort, how can we catch up with the benchmark? It's not okay to seek comfort and only look for easy things. When will we catch up with England?"
    I jokingly asked, "Didn't you put up a big-character poster asking the leaders to issue leather chairs when the rectification campaign just started?" Little Wu lowered his head, then looked at me and said, "What are you kidding? This is also a Great Leap Forward. I used to get angry when I saw the factory director sitting on a sofa, but now I understand that the Party Secretary also gets sick from blowing ash in the boiler room! Once I understood, I wanted to chop up the chair." I asked, "Why?" Little Wu continued, "Before, when I saw it, I wanted to lean on it and rest. Now it has become a knot in my heart. If it weren't for it, our backwardness wouldn't be so obvious. If it's gone, won't my legs be sore? I'll stand all the time, and see how sore they get. I must train myself into Master Liu's iron legs, and see whose iron legs are stronger!"
    I said good, "I'll race you first." I patted my legs, the soreness was gone, and I felt very relaxed, a surge of energy ran from the top of my head straight to the soles of my feet.

    椅子
    石景山发电厂工人　阎一忠
    吃完饭我和吴喜才去参加宣传员会。会议室座满了，只剩下一个小方凳，空着，我抢先一步，心里乐滋滋的舒舒服服的坐下去。这两天为了赶先进，走马灯似的围着炉转，腿有些酸疼了。在班上还好，看着火红火红的炉膛和跳跃飞舞的火苗，将我的心也引得跳跃起来；再加上指标渐渐离最先进的标杆越来越近，腿酸也就忘了。下了班，两只脚就像石头一样，笨得走不动。能坐会儿我太高兴了。我把右腿放在左腿上，以胜利者的口气，买好说：“小吴，来，咱俩一块坐。”我移出一个角，心想，往常你不是抢座吗，今儿我先抢着了，要不是你今儿老实，说什么也不让你。我看他，他向我笑了笑。我由纳闷、奇怪，变得愕然和惭愧了。
    我正沉思和愧悔的当儿，工会主席发言了：“宣传员们，咱们比干劲，比先进的劲头来喽。向标杆看齐，向不辞劳苦的老师傅学习的风气到处都是。举个例看吧，高压炉新司炉吴喜才这个小伙子，过去八小时坐六小时；现在全变啦，一班八小时屁股也不粘凳子，前两天要把椅子交了，你看这是什么劲头？就这劲头，灰中可燃物由20％降到8％，和标杆才差2％。我说宣传员同志们，咱们也要来个干劲，跟上去……”。
    我明白了。开完会我扶着小吴的肩膀回宿舍的时候，我说：“小吴，够意思啊。”小吴腼腆的说：“算什么，人家刘老师父，干了几十年，现在还老围着炉转，两条腿像铁铸的一样，不知道累，椅子成了摆设，靠都不靠，人家为谁！咱们技术不行，不多卖点力气，怎么能赶上人家标杆呢？图安逸不行，净找舒坦事，多会儿赶上英国呢？”
    我又打趣的问：“整风刚开始，你不是贴大字报要领导发皮椅子吗？”小吴低了头，随又望着我说：“逗什么，这也是跃进，过去见厂长坐沙发生气，现在明白了，党委书记不也一样到锅炉间吹灰累病了！我明白过来就想把椅子劈了。”我问“为啥？”小吴接着说：“从前我看见它就想靠靠、歇会儿，现在变成我心中的疙瘩，要不是它，还显不出咱们的落后劲呢。去了它，腿不是酸吗？我老站着，看酸到哪去。非练成刘师傅的铁腿不可，看谁的铁腿结实！”
    我说好：“我先和你赛赛。”我把腿撢了一下，酸疼没有了，觉得很轻松，一股劲头，由头顶直贯到脚根。
