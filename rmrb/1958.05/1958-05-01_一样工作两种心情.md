    Same Work, Two Moods
    Huang Yuying, Yuhua East Road Department Store, Baoding City

    In 1954, I was transferred from the cultural troupe to work as a saleswoman in the department store, but I couldn't settle into the work for a long time. I always felt that this job had no future, so I worked sloppily, often arriving late and leaving early. Managing more than seventy kinds of goods, I hadn't even memorized the names and prices of the items in nearly five years. When customers came, I would get annoyed if they didn't pick out two items quickly and would start arguing. As a result, the customer feedback book often contained criticisms of me, but I didn't care. I thought, "Anyway, they can't fire me for this."

    During the Two Antis Campaign, my comrades put up many big-character posters about me. Relatives, classmates, and friends would always praise the revolutionary spirit of our store when they met me. My uncle, who came from the countryside, also told me: the peasants worked through the night repairing reservoirs in the winter, and they got more and more energetic as they worked. My brother, who is an officer, also criticized me for being backward. One thing after another around me constantly stimulated me, causing me to have ideological struggles. One day, we studied and discussed the People's Daily editorial "Everyone for Me, Me for Everyone." After going back that evening, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. I thought: every day I wake up, I have to eat, wear, and use a lot of things. I don't know how many people are serving me every day, and the only service I provide to others is just handling goods, such a small thing. If I don't do it well, who am I letting down? Once the ideological problem was solved, my work mood completely changed. Now, I don't want to leave the store, and I can't stand being at home. When I see the goods displayed untidily, I feel uncomfortable from the bottom of my heart. Whenever I have time, I study with our team leader to familiarize myself with the specifications and quality of various goods. When customers come, I always feel that my service is not thorough enough. On March 30, I received a written commendation from a customer for the first time, and I felt an indescribable joy in my heart.

    一样工作两种心情
    保定市裕华东路百货公司　黄玉英
    1954年，我由文工团调到百货商店来当售货员，长期不能安心工作。总觉得，这个工作谈不上什么前途，因此，工作马马虎虎，经常早退迟到，管着七十多种商品，将近五年连品名牌价都没有记住；顾客来了，没挑上两样，就嫌厌烦，争吵起来，这样，在顾客意见薄上，时常可以看到对我的批评，但我却满不在乎。心想：“反正为这个也不能开除我。”
    双反运动中，同志们给我贴出了很多大字报；亲戚、同学、朋友们见面，总是赞扬我们商店的革命精神。舅舅从农村里来也向我谈：农民冬天修水库，拿黑夜当白天，越干越劲足，哥哥是个军官，也批评我不该落后。周围一件又一件的事不断的刺激着我，使我产生了思想斗争。那天，我们学习讨论人民日报“人人为我，我为人人”的社论，回去以后，晚上翻来复去睡不着觉，我想：我每天一起来就得吃、穿，用很多东西，不知有多少人在天天为我服务，而我为别人服务，不过就是拿拿货这么一小点。还不好好干，对得住谁呢？思想问题解决了，工作的心情也就完全改变了。现在，我不愿离开商店，在家呆不下去。看到商品陈列不整齐，从心眼里觉得不舒服；一有时间就跟我们的组长学习熟悉各种商品的规格、质量；顾客来了，总觉得自己服务得不周到。3月30日，我第一次得到了顾客的书面表扬，心里真有说不出的高兴。
