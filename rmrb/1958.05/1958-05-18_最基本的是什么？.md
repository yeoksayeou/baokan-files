    What is most fundamental?
    In doing anything, one must consider what the most fundamental issue is, that is, what the principal contradiction is.
    Considering basic questions is not just a matter of method, but also a matter of guiding ideology.
    Developing local industry, in terms of tasks, has four aspects. First, serving agricultural production; second, serving national heavy industry; third, serving the lives of urban and rural people; and fourth, meeting the needs of exports. All four aspects of these tasks are important and need to be done well. But which aspect is the most fundamental? Without a doubt, serving agricultural production is the most basic.
    Frequently considering what the basic issues are in one's work can clarify the direction of one's work. When Ding County started running local industries, it only cared about products with high output value and high profits, while neglecting the most basic issue of serving agriculture. As a result, the direction was not clear, and it took a detour. However, after grasping the basic point of serving agricultural production, the situation was completely different. From this, it can be seen that learning to grasp the most basic problems in work is the key to doing a good job.

    最基本的是什么？
    做任何事情，都得要考虑一下最基本的问题是什么，也就是主要矛盾是什么。
    考虑基本问题，这不仅仅是个方法问题，而且也是个指导思想问题。
    发展地方工业，从任务来说，它有四个方面。一是为农业生产服务，二是为国家大工业服务，三是为城乡人民生活服务，四是为满足出口的需要。这四方面的任务都是重要的，都是需要做好的。但是哪一方面是基本的呢？毫无疑问，为农业生产服务是最最基本的。
    经常考虑工作中的基本问题是什么，就能使自己的工作方向明确。定县开始办地方工业时，只顾搞产值大、利润高的产品，而忽视了为农业服务这个最基本的问题，结果方向不明确，走了一段弯路。而抓住了为农业生产服务这个基本点以后，情况就完全不同了。由此可见，学会抓工作中的最基本的问题，是做好工作的关键。
