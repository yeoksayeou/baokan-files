    South American People Universally Hate American Plunderers
　　Nixon Again Subjected to Spitting in Bogotá
    Xinhua News Agency, May 12th: Bogotá dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon encountered spitting from the masses again in Colombia.
    Nixon arrived in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, on May 11th, to begin his visit. The night before, posters had already been plastered all over the streets of Bogotá with slogans like "Down with Nixon," "Nixon, twelve million Colombians thank you for supplying the weapons that kill the Colombian people!" "Nixon, twelve million Colombians suffering from hunger and unemployment salute you!" The authorities took strict precautions, announcing a ban on mass demonstrations and arresting some people.
    Despite this, when Nixon arrived at the hotel after being officially welcomed at the airport, hundreds of angry people held a demonstration in front of the hotel. The demonstrators burned pictures of Nixon and shouted slogans like "Who stole our coffee?" "Who stole Panama?" "Death to Nixon!" The authorities used mounted police to disperse the crowd, injuring some and arresting others.
    In Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, the next country Nixon is scheduled to visit, hundreds of university students held an hour-long demonstration on campus on May 11th. The marching crowd led a donkey with a paper figure symbolizing Nixon sitting on it. The paper figure was inscribed with: "Down with Nixon!"
    Venezuelan military junta leader Larrazábal said at a press conference on the evening of May 10th that during Nixon's visit to Venezuela, he would discuss with Nixon the issue of the United States restricting the import of Venezuelan oil and the issue of former Venezuelan dictator Jiménez residing in the United States. Larrazábal said he hoped the United States would no longer allow Jiménez to continue living in the United States.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 12th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on May 11th: American newspapers, in commenting on the anti-American demonstrations that occurred when Nixon arrived in Peru, had to admit that the problem arose from the U.S. policy of disregarding the economic interests of Latin American countries.
    The Spanish-language newspaper "Diario de Nueva York" published in New York pointed out in an editorial that Nixon visited Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia before Peru, and Peru only expressed more strongly the phenomena that had appeared in these countries.
    A United Press reporter explained why Peru harbored such strong and growing hostility towards the United States. In his dispatch from Peru, he wrote:
    "During World War II, the United States demanded aluminum, zinc, sugar, cotton, and oil from this country. But after the war, Peru could not find a market for these products. The United States closed its doors to these goods, imposed quotas on imports, threatened to raise tariffs, and sold American cotton on the world market at dumping prices.
    "At the same time, the (U.S.) State Department repeatedly discussed the issue of free trade, attempting to persuade Peru and other Latin American countries to reduce tariff barriers on the import of American manufactured goods."
    The reporter pointed out that Peru's economic situation has deteriorated, especially in the past year, with the country's dollar reserves falling from 40 million to 4 million U.S. dollars. The reporter wrote that "ordinary people" blame all this on "American economic policy."

    南美人民普遍痛恨美国掠夺者
　　尼克松在波哥大又遭唾骂
    新华社12日讯　波哥大消息：美国副总统尼克松在哥伦比亚又遭遇到群众的唾骂。
    尼克松11日从厄瓜多尔到达哥伦比亚首都波哥大访问。前一天晚上，波哥大全市各街已经贴出了
  “打倒尼克松”、“尼克松，一千二百万哥伦比亚人为了你们供给的杀害哥伦比亚人民的武器而感谢你！”“尼克松，一千二百万深受饥饿和失业痛苦的哥伦比亚人向你致敬！”等标语。当局采取了严密的防范措施，宣布禁止群众举行示威游行，并且逮捕了一些人。
    尽管如此，当尼克松在飞机场受到哥伦比亚官方的欢迎以后来到旅馆时，仍然有几百个愤怒的群众在旅馆面前举行了示威。示威群众焚烧了尼克松的像片，并且高呼“谁窃取了我们的咖啡？”“谁窃取了巴拿马？”“打死尼克松！”等口号，当局用骑警驱散了群众，使一些人受伤，还有一些人被捕。
    在尼克松下一个要访问的国家委内瑞拉的首都加拉加斯，11日已经有几百个大学生在校园里举行了一小时的示威游行，游行的队伍牵了一头驴子，上面坐着一个象征尼克松的纸人，纸人上写着：“打倒尼克松！”
    委内瑞拉军政府首脑拉腊萨巴耳10日晚在记者招待会上说，在尼克松访问委内瑞拉时，他将同尼克松讨论关于美国限制输入委内瑞拉石油问题和委内瑞拉前独裁者希门尼斯在美国居留的问题。拉腊萨巴耳说，他希望美国将不再准许希门尼斯继续住在美国。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：美国报纸在评论尼克松到达秘鲁时发生的反美示威时不得不承认，问题是由于美国的不顾拉丁美洲国家经济利益的政策而产生的。
    纽约出版的西班牙文报“每日新闻报”在社论中指出，尼克松到秘鲁之前访问了阿根廷、乌拉圭和玻利维亚，在秘鲁只不过是把在这几个国家出现过的现象表现得更强烈而已。
    合众社记者说明为什么秘鲁对美国怀着如此强烈而且日益增长的敌意，在他从秘鲁发出的电讯中写道：
    “在第二次世界大战期间，美国向这个国家索取了铝、锌、糖、棉花和石油。但是战争结束后，秘鲁这些产品就找不到市场了。美国对这些货物关上了大门，对进口规定了限额，用提高关税来进行威胁，并且按照倾销价格在世界市场上出售美国棉花。
    “与此同时（美国）国务院一再讨论自由贸易问题，企图劝说秘鲁等拉丁美洲国家在进口美国制成品时减少关税上的障碍”。
    这个记者指出秘鲁经济情况恶化，特别是最近一年来这个国家的美元贮备从四千万美元降到四百万美元。记者写道，“一般人”都把这一切归罪于“美国的经济政策”。
