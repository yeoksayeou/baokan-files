　　There's Always Someone Better

　　Cui Zhongming Operates Six Milling Machines

　　Relying on ambition and deep study, Cui Zhongming, a young milling machine operator at a state-owned factory in Xi'an, has surpassed Yu Wanlai by operating six milling machines.

　　Cui Zhongming is a fourth-grade milling machine operator in the tool workshop. He used to work in the same factory as Liao Shigan, a nationally famous young milling machine operator from Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, and Yu Wanlai, a young milling machine operator from the state-owned Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory who was the first in Xi'an to implement multi-milling machine operation. When he first arrived at a state-owned factory last year, he had difficulty managing one milling machine. During the Great Leap Forward this year, he was greatly inspired after Yu Wanlai created a record of operating five milling machines. He resolved to catch up with Yu Wanlai. At that time, some people said that general products are mass-produced and can be operated with multiple machines, but tool production is single-piece production, and the shapes and sizes of the products are not fixed, so multi-machine operation may result in more rejects and accidents. He said, if Yu Wanlai can do it, why can't I? He set a plan to learn from Yu Wanlai, finding tricks and methods from all aspects, and studying and improving tools and operating methods in various ways. With the strong support of the factory and workshop Party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders, and with the assistance of technicians, he carried out eight improvements and innovations in machine tools and operating methods. From April 20 to May 4, he continuously expanded from operating one milling machine to six. Coupled with improvements in tools and operating methods such as multi-loading and multi-clamping, and reducing the number of milling cutter passes, it is preliminarily estimated that work efficiency can be increased by twenty-eight to fifty times. Moreover, by strengthening preparatory work, auxiliary time has been greatly reduced. After the number of machines being watched expanded day by day, under the circumstances that the machine's revolutions and feed rate were not reduced, and the milling cutter amount was actually increased, not only were the material clamping and unloading of several milling machines connected in an orderly manner, but the operation did not appear particularly tense and laborious. Without an apprentice to help, the machines did not idle. Furthermore, in the past half month, there have been no rejects or accidents.

### 强中还有强中手  崔忠明操纵六台铣床

    强中还有强中手
    崔忠明操纵六台铣床
    一靠有志，二靠深钻，西安国营某厂青年铣工崔忠明后来居上，一个人操纵六台铣床，赶过了操纵五台铣床的余万来。
    崔忠明是工具车间的四级铣工，跟重庆建设机床厂全国著名的青年铣工廖世刚和西安市第一个实行多铣床操作的国营西安机器制造厂青年铣工余万来曾经在一个厂里工作过。去年他刚到国营某厂时，一个人看好一台铣床还有困难；今年大跃进中，余万来创造了一个人操纵五台铣床的纪录以后，对他启发很大。他下定决心要赶上余万来。当时，有些人说，一般产品是大量生产，可以搞多机床操作，工具生产是单件生产，产品的形状和尺寸不固定，多机床操作可能废品多，事故多。他说，余万来能作到，我为什么作不到？他订了学习余万来的规划，从各方面找窍门、想办法，多方钻研改进工具和操作方法。在厂和车间党政工团领导的大力支持和技术人员的协助下，他先后在机具上和操作方法上进行了八项改进和革新，从4月20日到5月4日，他由原来操纵一台铣床连续扩大到六台，加上多装多卡，减少铣刀次数等工具和操作方法上的改进，初步估计可把工作效率提高二十八倍到五十倍。而且由于加强了准备工作，大大压缩了辅助时间，看台逐日扩大以后，在机器的转数和走刀量没有减少、铣刀量反而增大的情况下，不但几台铣床的卡料和卸活衔接得有条不紊，操作中并不显得特别紧张费力。没有徒工帮忙，机器并没有发生空转现象；而且半个月来没有出过废品，没有发生事故。
