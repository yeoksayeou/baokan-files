Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 12th - The history of China not being able to manufacture sedans has come to an end: The first domestically produced "Dongfeng" sedan was born today at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

This medium-sized sedan has a novel style, is beautiful and comfortable, and has a brand-new streamlined body. The interior is equipped with heating, cooling, and various modern equipment. The upper part of the hood is silver-gray, and the lower part is purple-red. To maintain a national style, the front and rear lights use palace lanterns, and there is a silver dragon on the front of the car as a decorative trademark. It weighs 1.23 tons, has a maximum engine power of 70 horsepower, and a top speed of 128 kilometers per hour. Its fuel consumption is also relatively low, consuming about 9 to 10 liters per 100 kilometers. This sedan can seat six people, including the driver.

This afternoon, the sedan drove out of the workshop to the cheers of the people. Road tests around the factory proved that the engine was running well.

The newly produced "Dongfeng" sedan will be transported to Beijing on the 14th as a gift to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The "Dongfeng" four-wheeled, six-seater sedan is one of the basic models stipulated by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in the Second Five-Year Plan. It began to be designed in the fourth quarter of last year and was originally planned to be successfully trial-produced in the third quarter of this year. However, in order to present a gift to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the workers overcame unimaginable difficulties and successfully trial-produced it ahead of schedule. During the trial production process, with the assistance and support of dozens of units inside and outside the factory, the workers worked day and night, displaying unparalleled heroic spirit. More than 1,500 main parts and assemblies of the sedan were originally planned to take at least three months to complete the trial production. However, more than 500 workers, designers, and engineers responsible for the processing tasks worked continuously for more than ten nights, and after many failures, finally solved more than 240 key technical problems, and completed the trial production task in less than twenty days.

The trial-produced sedan will undergo a certain period of testing, and after national approval, will be finally finalized and mass-produced.

    我国汽车制造史又揭开新页
    东风牌小轿车出世
    新华社长春12日电　我国不能制造轿车的历史已宣告结束：国产的第一部“东风牌”轿车今天在第一汽车制造厂诞生。
    这部中型的小轿车式样新颖，美观舒适，有着全新式的流线型车身，车厢内装有冷、热风及各种现代设备，车盖的上部为银灰色，下部为紫红色。为保持民族风格，前后车灯采用的是宫灯，车头上有一个银色的小龙，作为装饰商标。它自重为一点二三吨，发动机的最大功率为七十马力，最高车速每小时为一百二十八公里。它的耗油指标也比较低，每百公里耗油约九公升到十公升。这种小轿车连同司机在内能坐六人。
    今天下午，这部小轿车在人们的欢呼中开出了车间。经绕厂跑行试验证明，它的发动机的运转情况良好。
    新产的这部“东风牌”小轿车将在14日运往北京，作为向中共“八大”第二次会议的献礼。
    “东风牌”四轮六座的小轿车是第一汽车制造厂在第二个五年计划中规定的基本车型之一，去年第四季度开始设计，原计划在今年第三季度试制成功。但是职工们为了向“八大”二次会议献礼，尽管遇到了难以想像的困难，还是提前胜利地把它试制成功了。在试制过程中，职工们在厂内外几十个单位协助和支持下，废寝忘食、通宵苦战，显示出无比的英雄气概。小轿车上的一千五百多种主要零件和合件，原计划至少需要三个月才试制完成，但是担负这些零件加工任务的五百多名职工和设计师、工程师们，一道连续苦战了十几个通宵，经过多次失败以后，终于解决了二百四十多个技术关键问题，只用了不到二十天便完成了试制任务。
    已经试制的轿车经过一定时期的试验，待国家批准便最后定型和成批生产。
