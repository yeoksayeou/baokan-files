Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 21st: The Japanese electorate will vote on May 22nd to elect 467 members of the next House of Representatives.

The election campaign among the various parties has been fierce. On the eve of the election, Nobusuke Kishi, following the United States, has accelerated the transformation of Japan into a base for atomic warfare, and his hostile policy toward China has led to a deterioration in Sino-Japanese relations. Nobusuke Kishi is also trying to amend the constitution after the election to freely revive militarism. Under these circumstances, the issues concerning Japan's peace, independence, and democracy have become the main issues of greatest concern to the Japanese public in this election campaign.

The Japanese Communist Party represents the wishes and interests of the Japanese people, and in its election slogans, it proposes: upholding peace, issuing a declaration prohibiting Japan from nuclear armament; striving for national independence, abolishing traitorous treaties; restoring diplomatic relations with China; opposing constitutional revision, opposing the revival of militarism. The Japan Socialist Party, in its election platform, also advocates the implementation of an independent and peaceful neutral foreign policy, and upholds the peaceful constitution. The Socialist Party advocates the restoration of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on the basis of not recognizing "two Chinas." It has also recently issued two declarations advocating the prohibition of nuclear armament for Japan.

On the other hand, Nobusuke Kishi, at the end of his campaign tour on the 18th, said that he would not change the basic direction of his foreign policy of cooperating with the "free nation" group, especially with the United States. At the same time, Nobusuke Kishi has repeatedly stated that he will not change his hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. Nobusuke Kishi has also tried in every possible way to cover up and deny his actions of assisting the United States in turning Japan into an atomic base.

The Kishi Nobusuke group's policy of following the United States and reviving militarism is being met with increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese people. "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government" has become a common cry of the broad strata of the Japanese people. One of the central slogans of the "May Day" celebration held by more than 600,000 working people in Tokyo this year was "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government." When the Japanese working class held the second "May Day" activity on May 17, more than 1.5 million workers across Japan held rallies to protest the reactionary rule of the Kishi Nobusuke government. The movement to demand the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan has flourished during this period. Many Japanese political parties, organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life have taken various ways to condemn Kishi Nobusuke for currying favor with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, being hostile to the Chinese people, and undermining Sino-Japanese trade. A mass rally held in Tokyo on May 20 demanded the opening of the tense situation in Japan-China relations. Japanese youth have also expressed a high sense of responsibility for the future development of the country. On May 15, more than 400,000 students in 59 cities across the country held rallies and demonstrations simultaneously to protest the nuclear weapons testing by the United States and Britain in the Pacific, and to protest Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards China. University students in Tokyo stated in their declaration that Japanese students must unite, resolutely launch a struggle to defend peace and democracy, and express their support for the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, working together to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

According to Kyodo News, there are a total of 952 candidates participating in this election for members of the House of Representatives, including 413 from the Liberal Democratic Party, 246 from the Socialist Party, 114 from the Communist Party, 34 from small parties, and 145 independents.

Nobusuke Kishi has repeatedly boasted that he will increase the seats of the Liberal Democratic Party in the general election from the original 290 to 310. These seats are close to the two-thirds majority in the Diet required to amend the Japanese Constitution. The Liberal Democratic Party also attempted to seize a two-thirds majority in the House of Councillors election in July 1956. However, this ambition was defeated by the left-wing parties who opposed amending the constitution at that time. According to an estimate by the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" on the 20th, the Liberal Democratic Party will lose some seats in this general election, and the Socialist Party will increase some seats.

The Kishi Nobusuke group is taking various measures to control this general election by taking advantage of its ruling position. According to a recent revelation by "Nihon Shimbun" Weekly, the Liberal Democratic Party is colluding with various influential figures and rich peasants in rural areas to control rural elections. Nobusuke Kishi and the Liberal Democratic Party are also using various deceptive promises, such as tax cuts, the implementation of a pension system, and the expansion of social insurance, to confuse the people and obtain votes. At the same time, the Liberal Democratic Party relies on the election funds of the Japanese monopoly capital groups to bribe votes. According to a recent estimate by "Nihon Shimbun" Weekly, the Liberal Democratic Party has received more than 10 billion yen in election funds from Japanese monopoly capital groups. As of May 19, nearly 170 people have been arrested by the police for exposing vote-buying activities.

On the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke group is also taking various measures to crack down on and isolate progressive forces. Nobusuke Kishi has recently taken the lead and mobilized the bourgeois newspapers and other propaganda machines to spread the fallacy of a "two-party system" consisting of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, in order to crack down on and isolate the Japanese Communist Party and alienate the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Nobusuke Kishi has also abused attacks on the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than 3 million members, and has persecuted trade union cadres on a large scale.

Kishi Nobusuke is thus taking various despicable means in an attempt to control the general election, so that the Liberal Democratic Party can continue to rule, and to strengthen the power of the Kishi Nobusuke group in the Liberal Democratic Party. Kishi Nobusuke has also publicly stated that after the general election, he will bring Hayato Ikeda, a well-known pro-American and former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's right-hand man, into the new cabinet. Kishi Nobusuke's plan shows that he intends to merge the pro-American factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, implement a more pro-American reactionary policy after the general election, and lead the Japanese people onto a dangerous path. This conspiracy of Kishi Nobusuke has aroused the vigilance of the Japanese public.

The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the "Akahata" newspaper on the 21st, calling on all Communist Party members and party supporters to redouble their efforts on the last day of the election campaign to win more people to vote for Communist Party candidates, in order to consolidate the foundation for Japan to become an independent, democratic, and peaceful country.

The appeal pointed out that the conspiracy of Kishi Nobusuke, with the support of US imperialism, to realize his militaristic ambitions, has been completely exposed due to his hostile attitude towards China. The appeal pointed out that the task of giving a serious blow to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of betraying the country and harming the people through tomorrow's vote rests on the shoulders of the Japanese Communist Party and all democratic forces in Japan.

    日本大选前夕形势
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本全国选民即将在5月22日投票选举下届众议院四百六十七名议员。
    这次各党派的竞选斗争十分激烈。大选前夕，岸信介追随美国加紧把日本变成原子战争基地，他的敌视中国的政策使中日关系恶化。岸信介还力图在选举后修改宪法以放手复活军国主义。在这种形势下，有关日本的和平、独立和民主的问题，在这次竞选斗争中已经成为日本公众所最关心的主要问题。
    日本共产党代表日本人民的意愿和利益，在它的竞选口号中提出：拥护和平，发表禁止日本进行核武装宣言；争取民族独立，废除卖国条约；和中国恢复邦交；反对修改宪法，反对复活军国主义。日本社会党在它的竞选纲领中也主张推行独立自主和和平中立的外交政策，拥护和平宪法。社会党主张在不承认“两个中国”的立场上和中华人民共和国恢复邦交。它最近还两次发表了主张禁止日本进行核武装的宣言。
    另一方面，岸信介在18日结束他的竞选旅行的时候还说，他将不改变同“自由国家”集团、特别是同美国合作的外交政策基本方针。同时，岸信介并且一再表示，他不改变敌视中国人民的态度。岸信介还多方掩饰和抵赖他协助美国把日本变成原子基地的行为。
    岸信介集团的追随美国和复活军国主义的政策，正在遭到日本人民越来越强烈的反对。“打倒岸信介政府”已经成为日本广泛阶层人民的共同呼声。六十多万劳动人民今年在东京举行“五一”节的中心口号之一就是“打倒岸信介反动政府”。当日本工人阶级在5月17日举行第二次“五一”节活动的时候，日本全国各地有一百五十多万工人举行集会，抗议岸信介政府的反动统治。要求恢复中日正常关系的运动，在这个期间有了蓬勃的发展。日本的许多政党、团体和各界知名人士采取各种方式谴责岸信介讨好美国和蒋介石集团，敌视中国人民，破坏中日贸易。5月20日在东京举行的群众大会，要求打开日中关系紧张局面。日本青年也表示了他们对国家发展前途的高度责任感。5月15日，四十多万学生在全国五十九个城市同时举行集会和示威游行，抗议美英两国在太平洋试验核武器，并且抗议岸信介采取敌视中国的政策。东京的大学生在他们发表的宣言中表示，日本学生要团结起来，坚决展开维护和平和民主的斗争，并且表示支持日本共产党和社会党，共同努力打倒岸信介政府。
    据共同社报道，参加这次众议员竞选的候选人共有九百五十二人，其中自由民主党占四百十三名，社会党二百四十六名，共产党一百十四名，小党派三十四名，无党派人士一百四十五名。
    岸信介一再吹嘘说，他要使自由民主党的议席在大选中从原有的二百九十席增加到三百一十席。这些席位接近修改日本宪法所必需的国会中的三分之二多数。自由民主党在1956年7月的参议院选举中也曾经企图攫取三分之二的多数。但是这个野心当时被反对修改宪法的左翼党派所击败。据日本资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”20日的估计，在这次大选中自由民主党将要失去一些议席，社会党将要增加一些议席。
    岸信介集团利用执政的地位采取各种办法控制这次大选。据“日本新闻”周刊最近揭露，自由民主党正在通过农村的各种有势力人士和富农勾结起来控制农村的选举。岸信介和自由民主党还利用各种欺骗性的诺言，如减税、实行养老金制度、扩大社会保险等来迷惑人民，骗取选票。同时，自由民主党依靠日本垄断资本集团的选举资金的援助来贿买选票。据“日本新闻”周刊最近估计，自由民主党从日本垄断资本集团得到的选举资金达十亿日元以上。到5月19日为止，已经有将近一百七十人因为收买选票的行为暴露而被警察逮捕。
    另一方面，岸信介集团还采取种种措施来打击和孤立进步力量。岸信介近来自己带头并且动员资产阶级报纸和其他宣传机器散布所谓由自由民主党和社会党构成“两大政党”制度的谬论，来打击和孤立日本共产党，离间社会党和共产党的关系。岸信介还对拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会滥施攻击，并且大规模迫害工会干部。
    岸信介就是这样采取种种卑鄙手段企图控制大选，使自由民主党继续执政，并且加强岸信介集团在自由民主党中的势力。岸信介还公开表示在大选以后他要把著名亲美派前首相吉田茂的左右手池田勇人拉入新内阁。岸信介的这种计划表明，他打算使自由民主党内的亲美派系合流，在大选后执行更加向美国一边倒的反动政策，把日本人民引向危险的道路。岸信介的这种阴谋，已经引起日本公众的警惕。
    日本共产党中央常任干部会在21日的“赤旗报”上发表呼吁，号召全体共产党员和党的支持者在竞选运动的最后一天，加倍努力争取更多的人投共产党候选人的票，以巩固日本成为独立、民主、和平的国家的基础。
    呼吁指出，岸信介在美帝国主义的支持下企图实现军国主义野心的阴谋，由于它采取敌视中国的态度已经完全被暴露出来了。呼吁指出，要通过明天的投票给岸信介内阁推行的卖国、反人民的政策以严重的打击，这个任务落在了日本共产党和日本所有的民主力量的肩上。
