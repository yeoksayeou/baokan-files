Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 27th: In Zhejiang Province, in recent days, responsible comrades from the Chinese Communist Party committees and governments in many areas have personally gone to the streets to sell newspapers, promoting the Party's general line for socialist construction.

On the 26th, Tao Zhenmin, Deputy Secretary of the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the CPC, Cui Wenbin, a person in charge of the Special Zone, Xu Yongsan, Secretary of the Jiaxing County Committee, and Ding Shenning, Deputy Secretary, and others hawked newspapers carrying news of the closing of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" on the streets of Jiaxing City, and promoted the spirit of this meeting to the masses. People rushed to buy newspapers from them and listen to their propaganda. When these enthusiastic volunteer newspaper sellers arrived at the dormitory of actors participating in the regional modern drama festival, the newspapers in their hands were immediately snapped up by the actors. Tao Zhenmin, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, encouraged the actors to read the newspapers carefully, study the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," follow the Party's general line for socialist construction, and reflect real life more and better, and to make drama creation prosper and serve production. The actors were very moved and presented him with a big-character poster: "Secretary Tao is full of energy, values politics and sells Party newspapers, takes newspapers to promote them, and every troupe runs to him. Such things are rarely seen, thanks to the secretary for selling newspapers. Politics takes command, be red and expert, emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past and compete to create, attaching importance to reading newspapers is the first rule, we won't forget the secretary selling newspapers."

Shortly after one o'clock this morning, when a train from Shanghai to Guangzhou passed through Hangzhou Station, passengers saw the May 27th Zhejiang Daily carrying Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report even earlier than the citizens of Hangzhou. This was delivered by Yu Guanxi, Editor-in-Chief of Zhejiang Daily, and four editors. When they learned the time the first train on the 27th passed through Hangzhou, they rushed to the station with the first batch of newly printed newspapers and boarded the train to sell them.

A wave of studying the documents of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" has already formed in the cities and villages of Zhejiang Province. Telephones and telegrams from all over the province requesting more newspaper subscriptions are endless. The Zhejiang Daily has been printing newspapers overnight for days. To get the newspapers to the readers as soon as possible, in addition to the entire staff of the newspaper, it has also organized cadres from government departments and students to volunteer to help promote sales.

    书记街头卖报  宣传“八大”精神
    群众增订报纸  电话电报频繁
    浙江城乡人民形成学习“八大”文件热潮
    新华社杭州27日电　浙江省许多地区的中共党委和政府负责人这几天亲自到街头售报，宣传党的社会主义建设总路线。
    26日，中共嘉兴地委副书记陶振民、专区负责人崔文彬，嘉兴县委书记徐永三、副书记丁慎宁等在嘉兴市街上叫卖刊登有关“八大”第二次会议闭幕消息的报纸，并且向群众宣传这一次会议的精神。行人都争先来向他们买报和听他们的宣传。这些热情的义务卖报人一来到参加全区现代剧会演的演员宿舍，他们手上的报纸就立即被演员们抢购一空。地委副书记陶振民鼓励演员们要好好读报，学习“八大”文件，遵循党的社会主义建设总路线，更多更好地反映现实生活，繁荣戏剧创作为生产服务。演员们听了非常感动，就送给他一张大字报：“陶书记劲头高，重视政治卖党报，拿了报纸来推销，各个剧团都跑到。这样事情少见到，感谢书记来卖报。政治挂帅红又专，厚今薄古竞创造，重视读报第一条，书记卖报忘不了”。
    今晨一时多，一列从上海到广州的列车经过杭州车站时，旅客们比杭州市民更早地看到了刊有刘少奇同志报告的27日的浙江日报。这是浙江日报总编辑于冠西和四个编辑人员送来的。当他们知道27日第一班列车经过杭州的时间后，便带着刚印好的第一批报纸赶到车站，登上列车叫卖。
    浙江省的城市和乡村中已经形成了学习“八大”二次会议文件的热潮。各地增订报纸的电话和电报应接不暇，浙江日报连日来通宵赶印报纸，为了让报纸早日送到读者手里，除报社全体人员出动外，还组织了机关干部、学生义务帮助推销。
