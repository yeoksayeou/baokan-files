Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, Paris Dispatch: To counter the increasingly serious fascist threat, the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor called for a general strike on the 26th. On the 27th, workers in many industries across the country responded to the call of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor and began a large-scale strike.

    As de Gaulle delivered his statement in Paris attempting to seize power, hundreds of thousands of workers laid down their tools as their firm response to the fascists. The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor held a meeting on the morning of the 26th and issued a communique afterward, calling on all workers and all trade unions to strike from 2:00 PM on the 27th. The General Confederation of Labor called on male and female workers to transform the afternoon of the 27th into a powerful demonstration of workers' solidarity, anti-fascist action, and defense of the republican system. The General Confederation of Labor also called on workers to: convene meetings after the strike to elect or expand workers' vigilance committees; hold demonstrations against the riotous groups, demanding that the government rigorously use the special powers granted to it to ruthlessly strike down the conspirators; strengthen workers' organizations and measures to resolutely and immediately counter all demonstrations or actions by the conspirators; unite, regardless of opinions or union affiliation, to achieve a united front among unions of various tendencies.

    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party then also issued a call, urging the entire working class to rise up and hold a strike. The French Communist Party also called on all members and all party organizations to strive to make this strike a massive and powerful one.

    The calls of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor were widely responded to by various trade union federations participating in the General Confederation of Labor. After receiving the call, the railway workers' union and the miners' union immediately issued instructions to hold a 24-hour general strike in their respective industries. Miners in many coal mines in northern, central, and Lorraine France began striking in the morning. The postal workers' union, the machinery manufacturing workers' union, and the civil servants' union all decided to participate in the general strike. Workers of the Paris Metro, buses, and suburban railways, according to the decision of the Municipal Transport Workers' Union, will begin a full-day strike from 11:00 AM. The taxi drivers' union decided to stop operating from 2:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning. (Attached picture)

    法国工人开始总罢工  反击法西斯暴乱阴谋
    新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：为了反击日益严重的法西斯威胁，法国共产党和法国总工会26日号召举行总罢工。27日，全国许多行业的工人纷纷响应了法国共产党和法国总工会的号召，开始举行大罢工。
    正当戴高乐在巴黎发表他的企图窃取政权的声明的时候，几十万工人放下了工具，作为他们对法西斯分子的坚决回答。法国总工会行政委员会26日上午举行会议，会后发表了公报，号召全体劳动者和所有工会从27日下午二时开始罢工。总工会号召男女工人把27日下午变为工人力量大团结，反法西斯的行动和保卫共和制度的有力示威。总工会还号召工人：在罢工以后召开大会，选举或扩大工人的警惕委员会；举行示威游行，反对暴乱集团，要求政府严厉地使用给予它的特别权力来无情地打击阴谋者；加强工人的组织和措施，坚决地立即反击阴谋者的一切示威或行动；不分意见或所属工会如何，团结起来，实现各种倾向的工会之间的统一战线。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局接着也发出号召，号召整个工人阶级起来举行罢工。法共还号召所有党员和一切党组织努力使这次罢工具有声势浩大的规模。
    法共和法国总工会的号召获得了参加总工会的各个工会联合会的广泛响应。铁路员工工会和矿工联合会在接到号召之后就立即分别发布了在它们行业中举行二十四小时大罢工的指令。法国北部、中部和洛林的许多煤矿的矿工从上午就开始了罢工。邮政员工工会、机器制造业工人工会和公务员工会都决定参加总罢工。巴黎地下铁道、公共汽车和市郊铁路的工人根据市运输工人工会的决定将从上午十一时开始一整天的罢工。出租汽车司机工会决定从下午两点到次晨六点期间停止出车。（附图片）
