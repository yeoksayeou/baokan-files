Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: According to a TASS report: Today, a military parade and mass rally celebrating "May Day" were held on Red Square in Moscow.

Before the start of the parade, the stands were filled with representatives of the Soviet working people and foreign guests.

When the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government ascended the reviewing stand on the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum, prolonged applause resounded across Red Square. Also on the reviewing stand were the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, and the Chairman of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, Sürenjav, who were visiting the Soviet Union at the invitation.

The parade began at ten o'clock in the morning. Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky, accompanied by parade commander Marshal Moskalenko, inspected the Soviet troops neatly lined up on Red Square and the surrounding streets. Marshal Malinovsky then ascended the reviewing stand and delivered a speech to the Soviet army, guests, and all Soviet working people.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the Soviet state has consistently pursued a policy of peace. He said that as a socialist country, the Soviet Union has never launched and will never launch a war. However, love of peace is not a sign of weakness. The Soviet armed forces have become powerful enough to crush any attempt by the reactionary imperialists to undermine the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the unity of the socialist camp.

Malinovsky mentioned the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing. He said: The ruling circles of Western countries stubbornly refuse our proposals aimed at eliminating the threat of war. The United States and Britain continue to expand their armaments, strengthen their military bases, conduct experimental explosions of nuclear weapons, and arm the West German army. They are doing everything possible to obstruct the convening of a summit meeting in the near future.

Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that the flights of U.S. Air Force planes carrying hydrogen bombs toward the Soviet border pose a serious danger to the cause of peace. He said that we protest against this threat and will take all measures to increase vigilance and be ready to repel such threats at any time.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the Soviet Union is celebrating "May Day" in a situation of creating strength, development, and achieving new leaps forward. The Soviet people are closely united around the Communist Party, practically solving the main economic task: to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production. People's China and other countries of the socialist camp are advancing unswervingly along the road of building a new life. No hostile forces can undermine the unity of the socialist countries.

Subsequently, the march-past began. As usual, the students of the various Soviet military academies led the way. Then came the motorized regiments of the Taman Division, renowned during the Patriotic War, the Marine Corps, the tank columns of the famous Kantemirovka Division, which liberated Poland and Czechoslovakia from the Hitlerite bandits, motorized artillery, various self-propelled guns, various calibers of guns, and rocket launchers similar to the famous "Katyusha" of the Patriotic War.

The parade lasted for forty minutes. Then, the bugles announced the start of the laboring people's parade.

As usual, a motorcycle team led the way in the front of the mass procession. The young men and women on the motorcycles held bright bouquets of flowers, which were a symbol of the socialist countries beginning their forty-first spring. Following closely behind were thousands of athletes, who performed graceful gymnastics while marching.

The marching columns entered the square in ten routes. Above the seething crowds were countless flags, portraits of party and government leaders, bouquets of flowers, placards and charts reflecting the achievements of the Soviet people. The numbers on the placards held by the farmers from the suburbs of Moscow showed that the Soviet collective farms and state farms had made initial achievements in the struggle to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of milk, butter, and meat.

Teams of young workers, students, scientists, and cultural workers successively passed through Red Square. Those standing on the reviewing stand gave a particularly warm welcome to Soviet scientists.

The marching columns held up placards with slogans for peace, such as "Stop Nuclear Weapons Testing." The slogan "Give Peace to the World" resounded across Red Square. Muscovites extended fraternal greetings to the people of all countries striving for peace, democracy, and socialism. Voices of congratulations to the laboring people of great China and other socialist countries resounded across the square. The mass rally in Moscow lasted for several hours. (Attached Images)

    “给世界以和平”的口号声响遍红场
    莫斯科举行阅兵和群众游行
    马利诺夫斯基发表演说苏军随时准备回击战争威胁
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社报道：今天，莫斯科的红场上举行了庆祝“五一”节的阅兵和群众游行。
    在阅兵开始以前，观礼台上就站满了苏联劳动人民的代表和外国来宾。
    当苏联共产党和政府领导人登上列宁和斯大林陵墓上的检阅台时，红场上响起了经久不息的掌声。在检阅台上的还有应邀访问苏联的阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔和蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔主席苏伦扎布。
    阅兵在上午十时开始。苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅由阅兵指挥官莫斯卡连科元帅的陪同，检阅了整齐排列在红场和附近街道上的苏联部队。接着，马利诺夫斯基元帅登上了检阅台，向苏联军队、来宾和苏联全体劳动人民发表了演说。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，苏维埃国家始终不渝地执行着和平的外交政策。他说，作为社会主义国家，苏联过去和将来都不会发动战争。但是，热爱和平并不是软弱的表现。苏联武装部队已经强大得足以粉碎帝国主义反动派破坏苏联人民和平劳动和社会主义阵营团结一致的任何企图。
    马利诺夫斯基提到了苏联关于单方面停止试验核武器的决议。他说：西方国家统治集团顽固地拒绝我们提出的旨在消除战争威胁的建议。美国和英国继续扩充军备，增强军事基地，进行核武器的试验性爆炸，武装西德军队。它们百般阻挠在最近期间召开最高级会议。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，美国空军载着氢弹向苏联边境飞行，这对和平事业具有严重的危险。他说，我们抗议这种威胁手段，而且要采取一切措施提高警惕，随时准备回击这种威胁。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，苏联在创造力量发展和取得新的跃进的情况下庆祝“五一”节。苏联人民紧密地团结在共产党周围，实际解决主要的经济任务：在按人口平均计算的产品生产方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。人民中国和社会主义阵营其他国家正在沿着建设新生活的道路确信不移地前进。任何敌对势力都破坏不了社会主义国家的团结。
    随后，阅兵的分列式开始。按照惯例，苏联各军事学院的学员走在最前面。接着是卫国战争中威名卓著的塔曼师的摩托化兵团、陆战队、从希特勒匪徒手中解放了波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的著名的康捷米罗夫斯克师的坦克队、摩托化炮兵、各种自动推进炮、各种口径的炮、近似卫国战争中著名的“喀秋莎”的火箭炮。
    阅兵式共历时四十分钟。接着，号角声宣布劳动人民的游行开始。
    按照惯例，摩托车队走在群众队伍最前列。摩托车上的男女青年拿着鲜艳的花束，这些花束是社会主义国家开始第四十一个春天的象征。紧跟在后面的是数千运动员，他们一边行进，一边表演着姿态优美的体操。
    游行的队伍分十路走进了广场。在沸腾的人群上面是数不清的旗帜、党和政府领导人的画像、花束、反映苏联人民的成就的标语牌和图表。莫斯科郊区农民所举的标语牌上的数字表明，苏联集体农庄和国营农场在争取按人口平均计算奶类、油脂和肉类生产方面赶上美国的斗争中已经取得了初步的成就。
    青年工人、学生、科学家、文化工作者的队伍陆续走过红场。站在观礼台上的人们特别热烈地欢迎苏联的科学家。
    游行队伍举着“停止核武器试验”等争取和平的标语牌。“给世界以和平”的口号声响遍红场。莫斯科人向争取和平、民主和社会主义的各国人民致以兄弟的敬礼。广场上响起了向伟大的中国和其他社会主义国家的劳动人民祝贺的声音。莫斯科的群众游行持续了数小时。（附图片）
