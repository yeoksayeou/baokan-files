Party Committee Takes Command, Four Combinations:
    Technical Reform Blossoms Throughout Beizhen County

    (Reported by this newspaper) Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, during the spring plowing and sowing season, with the Party committee taking command, and with the county, township, and commune-level agricultural technology research committees as advisory bodies, adopted the method of "Four Combinations," launching a mass technical reform movement involving the entire Party and all the people. This has brought about an unprecedented new situation of good technology, high quality, and rapid progress in this year's spring plowing and sowing work.

    The Beizhen County Committee of the Communist Party of China, while concentrating its efforts on vigorously promoting water conservancy and manure collection last winter and this spring, also paid attention to strengthening leadership over agricultural technical reform. First, it strengthened agricultural technical work organizationally. The number of comprehensive agricultural technical service stations in the county increased from three last year to seven; mass agricultural technical research organizations are even more widespread. Every township and commune has an agricultural technology research committee, and every production team has a technical group (or technician). Participants in the agricultural technology research committees at all levels include leading cadres responsible for production, agricultural technicians, and experienced old farmers. During the preparatory plowing and spring plowing production, the Party committee, through the agricultural technology research committees, adopted the mass line working method of "Four Combinations – combining agricultural technicians with old farmers, combining the promotion of new scientific technologies with local inherent production-increasing experiences, combining the reform of farming systems with the improvement of production tools, and combining the formulation of technical plans, the training of technical backbones, and the organization of mass technical debates and inspections" to vigorously promote technical reform, forming a mass technical innovation upsurge in the rural areas of the county.

    Before the start of spring plowing, the County Agricultural Technology Research Committee first studied the technical reform issues in the spring plowing and sowing stage, and proposed five major technical reform measures: actively promote intercropping, mixed cropping, and row intercropping; universally implement shortening ridges and increasing rows; seize the opportunity to prepare the land and conserve moisture; adopt scientific methods to strictly treat seeds; and sow in a timely manner when soil moisture is suitable to improve operation quality and eliminate underground pests. Each township and agricultural commune, based on the technical plans proposed by the County Agricultural Research Institute, combined with local conditions to formulate implementation plans for technical innovation in their respective townships and communes, enabling the masses to clarify the direction, master the methods, and fully invest in the spring plowing and sowing technical innovation movement. "Shortening ridges, increasing rows, and rational close planting" is an important part of the technical reform plan and is an effective production-increasing experience that has been practiced for several years. However, with the spring plowing time approaching, the large-scale ridge modification work encountered difficulties due to insufficient labor and animal power and the old-fashioned plows being too wide and having low tillage efficiency. In order to break through this difficulty, the County Party Committee promptly put forward the call to Party organizations at all levels to rely on the masses to reform and create new tools, stimulating the creative enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and the masses. Zhong'an Commune in Zhong'an Township took the lead in creating the "two-horse, three-plow" ridge modification tool, which increased ridge modification efficiency by more than double compared to the old-fashioned two-horse, one-plow. Subsequently, the Wu'er Commune in Liu Ren Township created and modified the "two-horse, three-ridge plow," which further improved the tillage efficiency by half compared to the "two-horse, three-plow." After these tools were promoted throughout the county, the ridge modification progress was greatly accelerated.

    In order to ensure the extensive development of the spring plowing and sowing technical reform movement, each township, with the agricultural technology service station as the core, conducted large-scale general training of technical backbones in batches and by region. According to incomplete statistics, the county has trained more than 50,000 farmer technicians since the preparatory plowing, with an average of less than one farmer technician with single-item technical training for every three male and female laborers in the county. At the same time, various townships and communes also used the evenings to organize the masses to learn new farming techniques, and through technical debates, the new farming techniques basically reached every household. Many agricultural communes also put up wooden signs on each plot of land, writing the crop area, yield targets, technical measures, and responsible persons on them, achieving technical implementation and blossoming everywhere.

    Due to the Party committee taking command, adopting the "Four Combinations," and comprehensively carrying out the agricultural technical innovation movement, the spring plowing and sowing situation in this county has been completely renewed this year.

    党委挂帅　四大结合
    北镇县技术改革遍地开花
    本报讯　辽宁省北镇县在春耕播种中党委挂帅，以县、乡、社三级农业技术研究委员会为参谋部，采取“四大结合”的方法，全党全民大搞技术改革，使今年春耕播种工作出现了史无前例的技术好、质量高、进度快的新面貌。
    中共北镇县委在去冬今春集中力量大抓水利和粪肥同时，便注意加强对农业技术改革工作的领导。首先从组织上加强了农业技术工作。全县的综合性农业技术服务站由去年的三个增加到七个；群众性的农业技术研究组织更是普遍。乡乡社社都有农业技术研究委员会，每个生产队都有技术小组（或技术员）。参加各级农业技术研究委员会的，有负责生产工作的领导干部、农业技术人员和经验丰富的老农。在备耕和春耕生产中，党委便通过农业技术研究委员会采用“四大结合——农业技术人员与老农结合，推广新的科学技术与本地固有的增产经验结合，改革耕作制度与改良生产工具结合，制订技术方案、培训技术骨干与组织群众技术辩论、检查结合”的群众路线的工作方法大搞技术改革，在全县农村形成了群众性的技术革新高潮。
    在春耕开始前，县农业技术研究委员会便先研究了春耕播种阶段的技术改革问题，提出五大技术改革措施：积极推广套种、混种、间种；普遍推行缩垅增行；抓紧时机整地保墒；采用科学方法，严格种籽处理；适时趁墒播种，提高作业质量，消灭地下害虫。各乡和农业社根据县农研究会提出的技术方案，分别结合本地情况，层层制订了本乡、本社的技术革新执行措施方案，使群众明确方向，掌握作法，全力投入春耕春播技术革新运动。“缩垅增行，合理密植”是技术改革方案中的一项重要内容，是几年来行之有效的增产经验。但是，春耕时间迫近，要大规模地进行改垅工作，便遇到了劳畜力不足和旧式犁铧过宽、耕作效率低的困难。为了冲破这一难关，县委及时向各级党组织提出了依靠群众改革和创造新工具的号召，激发了广大干部和群众的创造热情。中安乡中安社一马当先，创造了“二马三犁”的改垅工具，比旧式二马一犁提高改垅效率一倍以上；接着刘任乡五二社又创造改制出“二马三垅犁”，比“二马三犁”的耕作效率又提高一半。这些工具在全县推广后，改垅进度大大加快。
    为了保证春耕播种技术改革运动的广泛开展，各乡以农业技术服务站为核心，分区分批大规模地普训了技术骨干。据不完全统计，全县从备耕以来共训练了农民技术员五万多人，全县男女劳动力平均不到三人中就有一人受过单项技术训练的农民技术员。同时，各个乡、社还利用晚间组织群众学习新的耕作技术，并通过技术大辩论，使新的耕作技术基本上达到家喻户晓。很多农业社并且逐地逐块订上了木牌，把作物面积、产量指标、技术措施和负责人都写在上边，达到了技术落地，遍地开花。
    由于党委挂帅，采用“四大结合”，全面开展农业技术革新运动，今年这个县的春耕播种面貌焕然一新。
