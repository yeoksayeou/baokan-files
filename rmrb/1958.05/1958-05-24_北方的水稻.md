Northern Rice

Rice cultivation in northern regions has a history of over four thousand years. In the Huai River basin, irrigation projects for tens of thousands of acres of paddy fields were built more than two thousand five hundred years ago. The cultivation of dryland rice in the Songliao Plain of Northeast China has been ongoing for over three hundred years, and the cultivation of paddy rice for over one hundred years. However, due to restrictions imposed by successive ruling classes and frequent natural disasters, the development of rice production in northern regions was extremely slow, reaching only over 14 million mu by 1949.

After liberation, rice production in the north experienced rapid development. In the three years from 1950 to 1952, it increased by more than 3.6 million mu, expanding the paddy field area to over 17.6 million mu. Following continued development after 1952, the area of rice in northern China reached 30 million mu in 1957, accounting for 6.27% of the total rice planting area in the country. In the eight years since liberation, the total rice planting area nationwide increased by 27.8%, while the rice area in northern China increased by 116% during the same period. The yield per unit area of rice in northern regions is also very high. Last year, the average yield per mu of rice in the suburbs of Tianjin reached more than 600 jin. In Shuoyuan Village, Yingkou County, Liaoning, 900 mu of rice yielded more than 1,100 jin per mu. Last year, the Beidagang Mutual Aid Agricultural Cooperative in Huanghua County, Hebei, cultivated 9,000 mu of reclaimed land for rice planting, averaging 1,023 jin per mu; the Qinghe Agricultural Cooperative in Yijun County, northern Shaanxi, produced 1,150 jin per mu on 40 mu of rice. In small areas of high-yielding fields in northern regions, there have also been high-yield records of over 1,600 jin of rice per mu. It can be seen that the expansion of the rice area in northern regions plays an important role in increasing grain production in the north and achieving the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

Rice in northern regions is generally divided into spring rice and stubble rice. In Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other regions, spring rice, which is transplanted around the Grain Full (Xiaoman) solar term, is mainly cultivated. Stubble rice, which is transplanted after wheat harvest, is mostly cultivated in areas outside the aforementioned regions. Is it possible to grow double-cropping rice in northern regions? The Tianjin Municipal Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station is continuing to conduct experiments in this area on the basis of previous years' experiments.

Most of the rice in northern regions is japonica rice. "Yinfang," "Ishikari Hakumo," "Weiguo," "Aomori No. 5," and "Atomic No. 2," etc., are some of the many fine varieties of japonica rice here.

    北方的水稻
    北方地区栽培水稻已有四千多年的历史。淮河流域远在二千五百多年前就兴建了灌溉稻田万顷的水利工程。东北松辽平原种植陆稻已有三百多年，栽培水稻也有一百多年了。但是由于历代统治阶级的限制和自然灾害的频繁，北方地区的水稻生产发展极为缓慢，到1949年才有一千四百多万亩。
    解放以后北方水稻生产有了快速发展，1950——1952三年里就增加了三百六十多万亩，稻田面积扩大到一千七百六十多万亩。经过1952年以后的继续发展，1957年北方水稻的面积已有三千万亩，占全国水稻播种总面积的6.27％。解放以后八年来，全国水稻播种总面积增加了27.8％，北方水稻面积，在这个期间增加116％。北方地区的水稻单位面积产量也很高。天津市郊去年水稻平均亩产量达到六百多斤。辽宁营口县水源村九百亩水稻亩产一千一百多斤。去年，河北黄骅县北大港互助农业社开荒九千亩种稻，平均每亩收到一千零二十三斤；陕北宜君县清河农业社四十亩水稻，亩产一千一百五十斤。在北方地区的小面积丰产田上，也出现过一些亩产稻谷一千六百斤以上的高产纪录。由此可见，北方地区的水稻面积的扩大，对北方粮食增产，提前实现农业发展纲要规定的粮食增产指标，是有重要作用的。
    北方地区的水稻一般分春稻和麦茬稻两种。东北地区、内蒙古、新疆等地区，种植的都是小满前后插秧的春稻。小麦收获以后插秧的麦茬稻，多在上述地区以外的地区。北方地区能不能种双季稻呢？天津市农业综合试验站正在前两年的试验基础上继续进行着这一方面的试验。
    北方地区的水稻大部是粳稻。“银坊”“石狩白毛”“卫国”“青森五号”“原子二号”等就是这里许多粳稻良种的一部分。
