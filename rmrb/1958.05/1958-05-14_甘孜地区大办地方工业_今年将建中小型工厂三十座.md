Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th. The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province is making every effort to develop local industry. This year, it plans to build thirty small and medium-sized factories in various counties, including hydroelectric power plants, copper plants, asbestos plants, lead-zinc plants, and ammonium sulfate plants. Construction of all of them has begun, some have already started, and some have been put into production. The thirteen gold mines newly built in Dege, Kangding and other places have recently started production ahead of schedule and have dug out the first batch of gold.

After the thirty new factories are put into production this year, the total industrial output value will increase by more than four times compared with last year. The Autonomous Prefecture has extremely rich underground resources. More than 20 kinds of mineral deposits have been identified, including gold, silver, copper, crystal, and Iceland spar. Gold is found almost everywhere. A newly established geological team and geophysical exploration team are searching for underground resources in the towering mountains.

　　甘孜地区大办地方工业
    今年将建中小型工厂三十座
    据新华社成都12日电　四川省甘孜藏族自治州正在千方百计地兴办地方工业，今年计划在各县新建的水电厂、铜厂、石棉厂、铅锌厂、硫酸铵厂等三十座中小型工厂，都已开始筹建，有的已经动工兴建或投入生产。在德格、康定等地新建的十三个黄金厂，最近都已提前开工生产，挖出了第一批黄金。
    今年新建的三十个工厂投入生产以后，工业总产值将比去年增加四倍多。自治州地下蕴藏极为丰富，现已查明的就有金、银、铜、水晶、冰洲石等二十多种矿藏，黄金几乎各地都有。一个新成立的地质大队和地球物理勘探队，正在崇山峻岭间寻找地下资源。
