Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: The synchrophasotron for 10 billion electron volts at the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research has new improvements. Due to many studies, the intensity of the accelerated proton beam has been increased several times. New experimental devices for searching and studying new particles have also been established here. Professor Wang Ganchang of China and Professor Pontecorvo of the Soviet Union, leading a group of scientists, have made important contributions to this matter.

    This was stated by Professor Blokhintsev, Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, in a report to the fourth meeting of the Academic Council of the Institute on the 20th. The five-day meeting opened on the 20th in Dubna, near Moscow. In his report, Blokhintsev talked about the Institute's work in the past six months. He pointed out that the construction speed of some new laboratories of the Institute has been greatly accelerated. Before the end of the year, the reactor building, hydrogen station, multi-charge ion accelerator hall, and radiochemistry laboratory will all be completed. Scientists from twelve countries have greater opportunities to conduct research in modern physics.

    兄弟国家科学家通力合作
    联合原子核研究所工作进展很快
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：联合原子核研究所高能实验室一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器有了新的改进。由于进行了许多研究，加速质子束的强度提高了好几倍。这里还建立了探寻和研究新粒子的新的实验装置。中国王淦昌教授和苏联庞特科沃教授领导的一组科学家对这件事做出了重要贡献。
    这是联合原子核研究所所长勃洛欣采夫教授，20日在研究所学术委员会第四次会议上作报告时说的。这次历时五天的会议20日在莫斯科近郊杜布纳开幕。勃洛欣采夫在报告中谈到了研究所半年来的工作。他指出，研究所一些新实验室的建设速度大大提高了。年底以前，反应堆大楼、氢站、多电荷离子加速器大厅和放射性化学实验室都将建成。十二个国家的科学家有更大的可能性在现代物理学方面进行研究。
