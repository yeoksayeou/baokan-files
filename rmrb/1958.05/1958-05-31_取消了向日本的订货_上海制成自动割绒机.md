    Orders to Japan Cancelled
    Shanghai-Made Automatic Velvet Cutting Machine

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th. China's first automatic velvet cutting machine has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai No. 1 Velvet Factory. Using this automatic velvet cutting machine eliminates the need for manual cutting of velveteen and corduroy, thus increasing production tenfold.

    Velveteen and corduroy are both high-grade fabrics with elegant patterns and good elasticity, and are a popular clothing material among consumers at home and abroad. In the past, manual cutting was used, resulting in extremely low production and high labor intensity. The dyeing and printing industry departments had ordered two machines from Japan this year, and planned to continue purchasing forty more. However, due to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's sabotage of Sino-Japanese trade, the orders were cancelled. Now, the workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Velvet Factory have risen up to produce an automatic velvet cutting machine whose quality is even better than the Japanese products currently in use domestically. They have now begun small-scale production.

    取消了向日本的订货
    上海制成自动割绒机
    新华社上海30日电　我国第一台自动割绒机最近在上海第一割绒厂试制成功。使用这种自动割绒机，可以不再用手工割制平绒、灯芯绒，因此可以提高产量十倍。
    平绒、灯芯绒都是高级织物，花纹雅致，富有弹力，是国内外消费者普遍爱好的一种衣料。过去用手工割制，产量极低而劳动强度很高。印染工业部门今年曾向日本订购二台，并准备继续购四十台，由于岸信介内阁破坏中日贸易，取消了订货。现在上海第一割绒厂工人奋起制成的自动割绒机，质量比国内现在用的日本货还好。他们现已开始小量生产。
