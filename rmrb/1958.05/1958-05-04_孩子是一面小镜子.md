　　Children are small mirrors
　　Gu Wen
　　Children often resemble their parents in appearance, and some are so similar that acquaintances can immediately tell whose child they are. This is the innate influence of parents on their children.

　　Parents also have a postnatal influence on their children. Children have a natural inclination to imitate; they like to imitate adults' every move. Parents are the closest people to their children, and they constantly influence them with their behavior, thoughts, habits, and interests. This influence is reflected in the child's temperament and behavior, allowing people to see their family environment, understand their parents, and know the education they have received.

　　A three-year-old boy threw a temper tantrum at the nursery, slapping the table and hitting the benches, and throwing the small chair he was sitting on to the ground. When the teacher told him that he shouldn't do that, he retorted with perfect confidence, "That's how my dad is at home!" This showed us the terrible influence of a father with a violent temper who cannot control himself in front of his child.

　　Another child, just over two years old, tiptoed to the neighbor's door and asked in a small voice, "Is your little brother sleeping?" This was because when his little brother at home was sleeping, his mother taught him not to make loud noises. This showed us that correct education can enable a young child to understand how to care for others.

　　When we see a child who is rude and undisciplined, can we say that they are naturally naughty? No, we can conclude that they grew up in a family where no one cares about them, and the parents either spoil them or leave them unattended. Conversely, when we see a child who is polite, loves to work, is disciplined, and is also innocent and lively, we can be sure that they are receiving the correct education in a family that cares about their physical and mental health.

　　Children are small mirrors, reflecting the family's way of life, the parents' character, and the methods of educating their children. If parents can observe calmly, they will see their own shadows in their children and discover their own strengths and weaknesses. As the saying goes, "Like father, like son," and "Like mother, like daughter," which is the reason for this. To educate children into a healthy generation, to cultivate good living habits and new moral qualities in children, parents should often look at themselves in the small mirror of their children, examine their own behavior, and set a good example for their children.

    孩子是一面小镜子
    谷文
    孩子的相貌大多是像父母的，有的还相似得使认识的人一看就知道是谁家的孩子。这是父母对孩子的先天的影响。
    父母对孩子还有后天的影响。孩子有模仿的天性，他们喜欢模仿大人的一举一动。父母是孩子最亲近的人，他们时时刻刻都以他们的行为、思想、习惯和兴趣影响着孩子。这种影响反映在孩子的性情和举止上，使人们可以从孩子的性情和举止上看出他们的家庭环境，了解他们的父母，知道他们所受的教养。
    一个三岁多的男孩在托儿所发起脾气来就拍台打凳，拿起他坐的小椅子朝地上摔。教养员告诉他不应该这样，他却理直气壮地回答说：“我爸爸在家里就是这样的！”这使我们看到了一个性情暴躁，在孩子面前不能克制自己的父亲对他的孩子的恶劣影响。
    又有一个两岁多的孩子曾轻手轻脚地走到邻家门口，小声地问道：“你家小弟弟睡觉了吗？”这是因为他家里的小弟弟睡觉时，母亲教他不要大声吵闹。这就使我们看到了：正确的教养能使一个幼小的孩子也懂得关心别人。
    当我们看到一个行为粗野、不守纪律的孩子时，我们能说他是生性顽劣吗？不，我们可以断定他是生长在一个无人管束的家庭，父母对他不是娇纵溺爱，必是放任不管。反之，当我们看到一个有礼貌、爱劳动、守纪律，同时又天真活泼的孩子时，我们就可以肯定他是在一个关心孩子的身心健康的家庭里受着正确的教养。
    孩子是一面小镜子，家庭的生活方式，父母的为人和对孩子的教养方法都会在里面反映出来。父母如果能够冷静地观察，就会在孩子身上看到自己的影子，发现自己的优点和缺点。俗语说“有其父必有其子”、“有其母必有其女”，就是这个道理。要把孩子教育成健康的一代，使孩子养成良好的生活习惯和新的道德品质，作父母的应该常常对着孩子这面小镜子，检点自己的行为，给孩子作出好的榜样。
