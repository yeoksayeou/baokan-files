Baotou, May 28th (Reporter Lin Tian) -- The Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, which has begun to scale the peak of construction, has decided to accelerate its construction pace.

During the Double-Anti Campaign, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, following the general line indicated by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, called on the workers on the iron and steel industry construction front to "double the speed and use one investment as two," and delegated the investment originally planned for the first phase of the Baogang project to the Baotou Iron and Steel Company for contract use, tasking Baogang with considering how to increase its production capacity. All Baogang employees were greatly encouraged by this. The Baotou Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly put forward the slogan "Use one investment as two, double the output, and complete the eight-year task in five years." Initially, a significant number of leading cadres had many concerns about realizing this slogan, fearing that the contracted investment would be insufficient and that cutting major construction projects or reducing Baogang's advanced technological level would "cause serious harm," etc. Therefore, the Baogang Party Committee organized more than 100 leading cadres from the entire company to launch a thought liberation movement, guided by the general line, focusing on "emptiness" to lead "reality." After more than ten days of heated debate, they broke free from the shackles of conservatism, dogmatism, and empiricism, and everyone saw the positive factors for accelerating construction speed and the potential for saving investment. They also recognized the significance of accelerating Baogang's construction in the struggle to catch up with Britain in steel production. At the same time, after repeated balancing and calculation of the investment in dozens of factories and mines, it was proven that "using one investment as two" was possible. This eliminated the concerns of some comrades and strengthened their confidence. On this basis, the general company's various departments and the Baogang Design Institute, after extensive discussion and research, formulated the ways and measures to achieve the above plan.

(1) Change the design and equipment budget management: First, the main factories, workshops, and main equipment must resolutely maintain the original design scale and advanced technological level; second, non-main projects and non-main equipment, as well as auxiliary facilities and living facilities, should be resolutely reduced or postponed if possible. For example, in the Bayan Obo Iron Mine, some non-main projects were reduced or postponed while keeping the output and the automation and electrification of the main equipment unchanged. Another example is the postponement of the construction of two large gantry cranes in the coal storage yard of the coking plant, using steam cranes and other substitutes. The factory building structure, except for the main workshops of the steelmaking and rolling systems, will change the steel structure to a prestressed reinforced concrete structure. In terms of non-productive construction, the standards will be greatly reduced, and reductions will be made as much as possible, resolutely eliminating the thought of building a large and luxurious factory.

(2) Tap potential from "living" factors, that is, fully mobilize the subjective initiative of Baogang itself and all its employees. For example, try every possible means to speed up the construction progress and strive to put some factories and mines into production ahead of schedule. For example, appropriately expand the production capacity of the mechanical repair system, so that the eight or nine workshops in this system can not only undertake the mechanical repair and maintenance tasks of other production systems, but also manufacture some metallurgical industry equipment. Most of the non-standard equipment needed by Baogang's factories and mines can be manufactured by themselves, saving more than half of the cost compared to purchasing equipment externally. At the same time, it is necessary to greatly reduce construction costs and save administrative expenses.

In order to achieve the above requirements and ensure the realization of investment contracting, the general company has determined several important measures: (1) Implement "investment contracting, decentralization of power" and reform the internal construction system. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has delegated the investment to the Baogang General Company for contracting; the general company has decided to further delegate the investment to the various major factories and mines for contracting. In this way, the sense of responsibility, initiative, and enthusiasm of each factory and mine can be fully utilized. From the beginning of the plant construction, learn to run enterprises diligently and frugally and change the old practice of being ignorant of the investment, taking things one step at a time, and asking the higher authorities for money when it is not enough. To adapt to this measure, it was decided to change the construction management system within Baogang. It was decided to merge the two parties, A and B, into one unit, taking the project of each major factory and mine as a unit, so that the strength of the two parties could be twisted into one rope, and the forces of both production and construction could be arranged in a unified manner. The construction personnel are concerned about the future production, and the people in charge of production participate in the construction before the factory and mine are completed, and jointly take responsibility for building the factory and mine quickly, well, and economically.

At the same time, under the principle of unified planning of the construction of various factories and mines, the general company has delegated the specific modification of construction designs, the specific use of investment, technical supervision, and the approval of rationalization proposals to the various factories and mines. The various factories and mines have the power to maneuver in terms of finance, planning, and human and material resources, ensuring the realization of investment contracting.

(2) Streamline the organization again and reform unreasonable rules and regulations. The recent practice of the First Engineering Company has resulted in a reduction of full-time management cadres from the original 15.6% of the total number of workers to 8.2%, and a reduction of various procedures and reports by about 70%, while the work efficiency has increased by one to ten times. The general company is mobilizing all employees to comprehensively streamline the organization and reform the rules and regulations.

At present, the Bayan Obo Iron Mine, the No. 1 Blast Furnace, the Coking Chemical Plant, the Mechanical Repair Area, the Water Source Project, etc., are all under intense construction. The general company's design, equipment, finance, and administrative departments are all rearranging their work according to the above plan and measures. The design institute is stepping up its efforts day and night to modify some construction designs. At the same time, a socialist debate on "for whom to labor" has also been launched among the vast number of workers; among the technical and professional personnel, a heart-to-heart movement has been launched. From the organs to the construction sites, from people's thinking to the appearance of the project, the entire company is changing with each passing day, and all employees are confident and energetic in completing the above tasks.

    包钢决定加快建设步伐
    产量增一倍工期缩三年
    本报包头28日电　记者林田报道：开始跨上了施工高峰的包头钢铁联合企业，决定加快建设步伐。
    双反运动中，冶金工业部按照中央和毛主席指示的总路线，向钢铁工业建设战线上的职工提出了“速度快一倍、投资一当二”号召，并把包钢原计划第一期工程的投资下放到包头钢铁公司包干使用，由包钢考虑如何加大它的生产能力。包钢全体职工对此大为振奋。中共包头钢铁公司委员会及时提出了“投资一当二、产量加一翻，八年任务五年完”的口号。开始，相当一部分领导干部对实现这个口号存在不少忧虑，一怕包干的投资不够用，二怕砍掉主要工程项目或降低了包钢最新技术水平，“伤筋动骨”等等。于是包钢党委组织全公司一百多名领导干部展开了思想解放运动，以总路线为指导思想，重点论“虚”，以“虚”带“实”。经过十多天的热烈辩论，打破了保守主义、教条主义和经验主义的束缚，大家看到了加快建设速度的积极因素和节约投资的潜力，也认识到了加速包钢建设在钢铁产量赶上英国的奋斗中的重大意义。同时，经过对几十个厂矿的投资进行反复的平衡、计算，证明“投资一当二”是可能的。这样就消除了一部分同志的顾虑，坚定了信心。在这个基础上，总公司各部门和包钢设计院经过广泛讨论和研究，制定出了实现上述方案的途径和措施。
    （1）改变设计和设备预算管理：一是主要厂矿车间和主要设备，坚决保持原设计的规模和先进技术水平；二是非主要项目和非主要设备以及辅助设施和生活设施等，能削减和缓建的，坚决削减和缓建。如白云鄂博铁矿山，在产量和主要设备的自动化、电气化不变的条件下，削减和缓建一些非主要项目。又如焦化厂贮煤场缓建两台大型门式吊车，用蒸汽吊车等代替。厂房结构除炼钢、轧钢等系统的主要车间外，把钢结构改为预应力钢筋混凝土结构。在非生产性建设方面，大大降低标准，能减的尽量减，坚决去掉大厂阔气思想。
    （2）从“活”因素中挖掘潜力，即充分发挥包钢本身和全体职工的主观能动性。如千方百计地加速施工进度，力争部分厂矿提前投入生产。如适当扩大机械修理系统的生产能力，使这个系统的八、九个车间不仅能担负其他生产系统的机械修理、维护的任务，并可制造一部分冶金工业设备，包钢各厂矿所需的非标准设备很大部分就可自己制造，比外购设备节约一半以上。同时，要大力降低施工成本，节约行政开支。
    为了达到上述要求，保证实现投资包干，总公司确定了几项重要措施：（1）实行“投资包干，权力下放”和改革内部建设体制。冶金工业部把投资下放到了包钢总公司，由包钢包干；总公司决定再把投资下放到各个主要厂矿，由各个厂矿包干。这样就可以充分发挥各厂矿的责任感和主动性、积极性。从建厂开始，就学会克勤克俭办企业、改变过去那种对投资心中无数、走着瞧、钱不够就伸手向上级要的旧例。和这一措施相适应，决定在包钢内部改变建设管理体制。决定以每个主要厂矿的工程为单位，把甲乙双方合并在一起，把两方的力量拧成了一股绳，可以统一安排生产和施工两方面的力量，施工的人关心将来的生产，管生产的人在厂矿建成前参加施工，共同对多快好省地建成厂矿负责。
    同时，总公司在统一规划各厂矿建设的原则下，把施工设计的具体修改、投资的具体使用、技术监督、批审合理化建议等权力，都下放给各厂矿，各厂矿在财务、计划以及人力、物力方面都有了机动权，实现投资包干有了保证。
    （2）再次精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度。第一工程公司最近实践的结果，脱产管理干部从原来占工人总数的15.6％减到8.2％，各种办事手续和表报减掉70％左右，工作效率却提高了一倍到十倍。总公司正发动全体职工全面进行精简机构和改革规章制度。
    目前，白云鄂博铁矿山、第一高炉、焦炭化学厂、机械修理区、水源工程等，都在紧张施工。总公司的设计、设备、财务、行政等部门，都在按上述方案和措施重新安排工作。设计院昼夜加紧修改一些施工设计。与此同时，广大工人中，还展开了“为谁劳动”的社会主义大辩论；技职人员中，开展了交心运动。全公司从机关到工地，从人的思想到工程的面貌，日新月异，全体职工完成上述任务的信心坚定，干劲十足。
