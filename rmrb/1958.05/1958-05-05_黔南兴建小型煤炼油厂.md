    Qiannan to Build Small Coal-to-Oil Plants
    The first small coal-to-oil plant in the Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture – the Duyun Coal-to-Oil Plant – began construction on the 1st. Once completed, this plant can produce 75 tons of coal-to-oil annually for refining gasoline, engine oil, and lubricating oil. The investment is only about 200 yuan, and it is expected to be fully operational within this month.
    The Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has abundant reserves of high-quality coal underground, but they were not well utilized in the past. Now, the competent authorities have decided to build fourteen small coal-to-oil plants this year. After the first plant is put into production and initial production experience is gained, the remaining thirteen plants will be built successively.

    黔南兴建小型煤炼油厂
    黔南布依族苗族自治州第一个小型煤炼油厂——都匀煤炼油厂1日动工兴建。这个厂建成以后，可以年产供提炼汽油、机油和润滑油用的煤炼油七十五吨，投资只有二百元左右，预计在本月内就可以全部投入生产。
    黔南布依族苗族自治州境内地下储藏着丰富的优质煤，但是过去没有很好利用。现在主管部门决定，在今年内兴建十四个小型煤炼油厂；待第一个厂投入生产取得初步生产经验以后，其余十三个厂将陆续兴建。
