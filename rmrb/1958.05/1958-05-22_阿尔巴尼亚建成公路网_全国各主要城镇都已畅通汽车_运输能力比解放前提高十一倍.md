Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 20th: Albanian Deputy Minister of Transportation, Kirko, recently stated that Albania's highway transportation capacity is now 10.6 times higher than before liberation, the highway freight turnover is 23 times higher than before liberation, and passenger traffic has increased 67 times.

Albania is a mountainous country, and transportation was extremely inconvenient before liberation. At that time, Albania was the only country in Europe without a railway. Although there were several highways, most of them were built by Italian fascists for military purposes and plunder. Now, all major towns in the country are accessible by car, and there is also the first railway.

Kirko pointed out that last year alone, the transportation tools under the jurisdiction of the Albanian Ministry of Transportation transported 1.89 million tons of goods and 1.78 million passengers. Compared with 1938, the current freight volume in nineteen days is equal to the entire year's freight volume at that time; the number of passengers transported in one year in 1938 can now be transported in nine days.

Kirko spoke about these situations at a recent national conference of advanced drivers. These drivers participated in the "safe driving 100,000 kilometers without major repairs" campaign. Thanks to this campaign, which started in 1951, the state has saved 21 million lek. Some drivers have already created a record of safe driving 300,000 kilometers without major repairs.

    阿尔巴尼亚建成公路网
    全国各主要城镇都已畅通汽车
    运输能力比解放前提高十一倍
    新华社地拉那20日电　阿尔巴尼亚交通部副部长基尔科最近说，阿尔巴尼亚公路运输能力现在比解放前提高了十点六倍，公路货物周转量比解放前增加了二十三倍，客运量增加了六十七倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚是一个多山的国家，解放前交通极为不便。当时，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲唯一没有铁路的国家；虽然有几条公路，但大多是意大利法西斯为了军事目的和进行掠夺而修建的。现在，全国各主要城镇都已经畅通汽车，并且有了第一条铁路。
    基尔科指出，去年，仅阿尔巴尼亚交通部所管辖的运输工具就运输了一百八十九万吨货物和一百七十八万名旅客。如果同1938年相比，现在十九天的货运量就等于那时全年的货运量；1938年一年运送的旅客，现在九天就可以运送完。
    基尔科是在最近召开的先进司机全国代表会议上谈到这些情况的。这些司机参加了安全行车十万公里不大修的运动。由于在1951年开始的这个运动，国家已经节省了两千一百万列克。有些司机已经创造了安全行车三十万公里不大修的纪录。
