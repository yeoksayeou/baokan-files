　　Nixon's South American Stumbling Diary
　　Jin Feng
    April 27th, New York
    Today, the boss handed down a task. The "backyard" is having a storm, and he wants me to appease it. This is clearly a thankless task. To be honest, the boss's methods of raking in money in the "backyard" are a bit too harsh. In recent years, we've invested nearly 10 billion there (accounting for more than one-third of private overseas investment), and the money we've made is truly astonishing. Last year alone, we earned more than one billion. Some companies' profits are as high as 3000%—9375% of the total investment, truly breaking the world's record for making money. But the people there are said to hate us quite a bit. Especially with this year's unlucky economic "recession," the bosses have lowered the prices of coffee, sugar, lead, tin, zinc, and copper, restricted the import of non-ferrous metals and oil, and are selling off surplus cotton in large quantities, preparing to throw some of the losses caused by the "recession" onto their heads. No wonder they're making a fuss. I recall a saying from that experienced old fox, Dulles. He said: "I have a feeling that the situation in South America, Latin America is somewhat similar to the situation in China in the mid-1930s... Yes, if we are not vigilant, we will eventually wake up one morning and read in the newspaper that something similar to what happened in China in 1949 has happened in South America." Thinking of this, I clearly see that the boss's money bag and my political future are both threatened. I readily agreed to this task. I assured the boss: With my Nixon's silver tongue, I will surely win back hearts and minds!
    April 28th, Montevideo, Capital of Uruguay
    The first day of the mission had an ominous sign. As I got off the plane, amidst a few scattered cheers, I distinctly heard catcalls of ridicule. I couldn't help but feel a chill in my heart. That's not all. At a banquet held for me by the Uruguayan business community, I spoke at length, as one of their own, on the theory that "private capital has no smelly money," promising them more private investment to comfort their wounded hearts. Unexpectedly, they didn't appreciate it at all. Chairman Sanguietti even contradicted me, saying that the United States had set "unreasonable prices" for Latin America's raw materials and products (true enough, but can you blame me?). He also said that the United States buys less from Uruguay and sells more, and Uruguay's foreign trade deficit is nearly 100 million US dollars. Uruguay's foreign exchange reserves are less than 80 million US dollars, and prices have risen by 28%. This is also blamed on the United States. Moreover, he even implied that due to urgent needs, they would use wool and meat to exchange for oil and cotton from the Russians. This is what the boss fears most!
    May 3rd, Buenos Aires, Capital of Argentina
    Opening the newspaper, I'm filled with anger. The cartoon in the newspaper satirized my lateness to President Frondizi's swearing-in ceremony the day before. This newspaper must be subsidized by the Communist Party. But recalling the scene that day, it was really annoying. Originally, this presidential inauguration ceremony was not necessarily something I cared about. But since this was an appeasement mission, I had to try my best to satisfy their national pride. So I ate breakfast early and took a car to go. Unexpectedly, a large group of workers were crowded at the door, shouting and blocking me from entering. With great difficulty, I squeezed in, but I was already late! In order to win back hearts and minds, I planned to visit students and workers as much as possible, but I suffered another great humiliation. Today, during my meeting with faculty and students of the University of Buenos Aires, the students constantly questioned me about the role the United States played in overthrowing Guatemalan President Arbenz, and said that Puerto Rico is "an American colony that demands freedom." I know very well that Allen Dulles's moves were too blatant. He used money, guns, mercenaries, and American planes to overthrow the legitimate government of Guatemala, forced Brazilian President Vargas to death, and assassinated Panamanian President Remón..., but he was also acting on the boss's orders, and there was nothing to blame him for. But under these students' aggressive questioning, I had to admit that the United States had made mistakes in its past policies towards Latin America; considering that our gunboat policy is still difficult to change, I also said that we may make mistakes in the future. As for Puerto Rico, I said that they had already voted to continue their relationship with the United States rather than independence. Unexpectedly, this sentence led to a burst of ridicule. As I left the venue, I was greeted with boos and shouts of "Nixon, go home!"
    May 8th, Lima, Capital of Peru
    Today is a day I will never forget. The Vice President of the United States (and very likely the future President) was actually beaten. I really wonder if I am still living in the Western world under the American flag. It turned out that I went to San Marcos University to give a report today. As soon as the car arrived at the school gate, it was surrounded by thousands of students. Before I had time to speak, stones, orange peels, and garbage flew like rain. My adjutant, poor Jack, had a tooth knocked out, and I, my neck was also swollen from the beating. But I still maintained the greatest courage and tried to explain American policy under the stones and garbage.
    May 9th, Quito, Capital of Ecuador
    I have finally decided to abandon my plan to continue visiting students and worker leaders. I don't have to risk my life for the boss's money bag. Today, arriving in Quito and seeing that there were no slogans or cartoons mocking me on the streets, I couldn't help but secretly rejoice. Unexpectedly, Jack quietly told me that this was the result of the police working all night and half the morning. They finally washed away all the posters that were plastered all over the streets saying "Nixon, go home!" I was happy too early. And the Minister of Economy handed me a list of aid that Ecuador hoped to receive from the United States. Bah, to hell with him, does he naively think that the boss would open his money bag for nothing?!
    May 11th, Bogotá, Capital of Colombia
    As I attended the Country Club banquet in the hotel in Bogotá, the damn shouts of "Down with Nixon" and "Kill Nixon" reverberated in the air outside the hotel. Although I tried to remain calm, I still couldn't swallow the food. My wife was even more frightened and her face was pale. She kept begging me (even in front of the Colombians) to go back early. This is really a woman's short-sightedness. I must persevere to the last stop in Venezuela.
    May 13th, Caracas, Capital of Venezuela
    Compared to today's disaster, the impolite reception I received in the previous few days is simply nothing. I never imagined that Venezuelans would hate us to this extent! Naturally, I am very clear that this oil-rich country brings the boss a huge profit of 300 million US dollars every year, and each Venezuelan has to take out 50 US dollars on average. And recently we have restricted oil imports, which is equivalent to tightening the belts of about six million Venezuelans. But they can't go crazy either!
    If I have ever had a moment of not envying my own position as Vice President of the United States, it is today! God bless me, I was really scared.
    Today, as soon as I got off the plane, the first thing I saw was a huge white flag hanging in the center of the airport, with the words "Goodbye, Nixon, we won't keep you!" written on it in bright red. I knew things were bad. Looking further, the airport was surrounded by a dense crowd of people waving anti-American slogans. Just as I was about to get into the car, the crowd rushed forward, and eggs, tomatoes, avocados, and saliva were thrown at me. The saliva actually landed on my face and body, and I was trembling with anger. What grieved me even more was that my wife also suffered. As she was about to get into the car, a young man dared to grab her hand and shout: "Little Rock, what about the black children in Little Rock?" My wife was both angry and scared. God bless this woman, she actually remained calm and tried to make a smile. I admire her courage. After getting into the car, the disaster was not over. A large number of demonstrators surrounded the car and kept throwing stones, canes, tobacco pipes, cans, and spitting saliva. Our car was a mess, full of wounds. The windows were broken. I finally wasn't injured, but my translator, Lieutenant Colonel Vernon Walters, who was sitting next to me, had his mouth cut. "Nixon, go home, we won't forget Guatemala. No, we don't want you, Latin America will not accept American interference." These slogans pierced my eyes. I originally planned to go to the Venezuelan National Memorial first to lay a wreath at the tomb of their liberator, Simón Bolívar, to win back hearts and minds. But hearing that there were four thousand demonstrators there, I hurriedly cancelled this route. When I found out that there were no demonstrators around the American Embassy, I ordered the car to drive into the embassy quickly.
    All official visit programs to Venezuela were cancelled. I can't leave the embassy a step. I hope to arrive safely in Washington at ten o'clock the day after tomorrow, Amen!
    May 14th, Caracas
    In ten minutes, my wife and I will be leaving this burning land, if nothing unexpected happens.
    Now, fifty military police equipped with rifles and machetes are still guarding the embassy, and a dozen secret service personnel with pistols are around me. At this time, forty-nine American planes carrying a thousand paratroopers and Marines have arrived at the American base not far from here. Nevertheless, from yesterday to today, I have actually been trapped in the embassy, unable to move a step. It is said that yesterday, while I was sweating like rain under the siege of Venezuelans in the Western Hemisphere, anti-American demonstrations also took place in Rangoon in the remote Eastern Hemisphere. Our days are not easy. I really don't know if I will have the courage to go to Europe again in the second half of the year. There, Ike and Nixon have both suffered, and were cursed by the crowd to go home!

　　尼克松南美碰壁日记
　　金凤
    4月27日　纽约
    今天老板交下差使，“后院”起了风暴，要我去安抚一番。这明明是件吃力难讨好的差使。说实话，老板在“后院”捞的手段也忒辣一点。几年来我们在那里投资将近一百亿（占私人海外投资三分之一以上），赚的钱实足惊人。单是去年就赚了十亿多。有些公司的利润高达投资总额的3000％—9375％，真打破世界赚钱的纪录。但那里的人据说对我们也恨得不轻。特别是今年倒霉的经济“衰退”一来，老板们压低了咖啡、糖、铅、锡、锌、铜的价格，又限制有色金属和石油的进口，大量兜售剩余棉花，准备把“衰退”引起的损失抛一部分到他们的头上。难怪那边要吵嚷起来了。我想起有经验的老狐狸杜勒斯的一番话。他说：“我有这么一种感觉，南美洲、拉丁美洲的情况跟三十年代中叶的中国情况有点相似……。是的，如果我们不警惕，我们终会有一天一早醒来在报上读到南美洲发生同1949年发生于中国同样的事情的。”想到这里，我明明白白看到老板的钱袋和我的政治前途都受到威胁。我一口应承下这趟差使。我向老板保证：凭我尼克松三寸不烂之舌，定能收拾人心！
    4月28日　乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚
    出师头一天，兆头不妙。一下飞机，在零零落落的几声欢呼声中，我分明听到表示奚落的猫叫。我不由得心头一冷。这且不说。在乌拉圭工商界为我举行的宴会上，我以自己人的身份，发挥了一通“私人资本是没有臭味的钱”的理论，预许给他们更多的私人投资来安慰一下他们那颗受了创伤的心。岂料他们全不领情，主席桑基?蒂先生还顶撞起我来了，说什么美国为拉丁美洲的原料和产品规定了“不合理的价格”（诚然如此，这能怪我吗？）还说美国对乌拉圭购得少，卖得多，乌拉圭对外贸易逆差将近一亿美元了。乌拉圭外汇储备不到八千万美元，物价高涨28％，这笔账也算到美国头上。而且，他还居然暗示由于迫切的需要，他们将用羊毛和肉类向俄国人换取石油和棉花。这可是老板最怕的一着！
    5月3日　阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯
    打开报纸，就是一肚皮气。报纸上的漫画讽刺我前天在弗朗迪西总统宣誓仪式上的迟到。这家报纸定然受了共产党的津贴。不过想起那天情景，委实恼人。本来这个总统的就职典礼，也未必放在我的眼里。无奈此番这趟安抚差使，要尽量满足他们的民族自尊心。我就早早吃过早饭，坐车赶去。岂料门口拥着一大群工人，他们又喊又叫，堵住门不让我进去。好容易我挤得进去，已经迟到了！为了收拾人心，我计划尽可能的访问学生和工人，岂知又受老大一番窘辱。今天在我同布宜诺斯艾利斯大学的教职员和学生会见时，学生们不断责问我，美国在推翻危地马拉总统阿本斯的勾当中究竟扮了什么角色，还说波多黎各是“美国的殖民地，它要求获得自由”。我明知道艾伦·杜勒斯这几手干的太露骨，他用金钱、枪炮、佣兵和美国飞机推翻了危地马拉的合法政府，逼死了巴西总统瓦加斯，刺死巴拿马总统里蒙……，但他也是奉老板之命，没有什么好责备他的。不过在这些学生咄咄逼人的责问下，我只好承认美国过去在对拉丁美洲的政策中犯过错误；考虑到我们那种炮舰政策还难改变，我又说在今后我们也可能犯错误。至于波多黎各，我说他们已经投票决定宁愿继续维持他们对美国的关系而不愿独立。不料这句话竟引致哄堂的讥笑。在我离开会场时，迎接我的是一片嘘声和“尼克松滚回去”的叫喊声。
    5月8日　秘鲁首都利马
    今天这一天令我终身难忘。堂堂美国副总统（而且极有可能是未来的大总统）居然挨打，我真怀疑我是不是还生活在美国旗照耀下的西方世界上。原来我今天去圣马科斯大学作报告，汽车一到达校门口，就被黑压压数千学生围住。我还没有来得及开口，石子、橘子皮、垃圾如雨片般飞来，我的副官——可怜的杰克被打掉了一个牙，而我，我的脖子也被打肿了。但是我还保持住最大的勇气，在石子和垃圾下努力解释了美国的政策。
    5月9日　厄瓜多尔首都基多
    我终于决定放弃我的继续访问学生以及工人领袖的计划了。我犯不上用我的性命去为老板的钱袋冒险。今天到达基多，看到街头居然没有挖苦我的标语和漫画，我心中不禁暗喜。不料杰克悄悄告诉我，这是警察工作了一个通宵和半个上午的结果，他们总算把贴得满街的
  “尼克松滚回去”的标语洗刷一光。我高兴得未免太早了。而经济部长又交给我一份厄瓜多尔希望从美国得到援助的清单。呸，真是见他的鬼，难道他天真到以为老板会白白打开他的钱袋？！
    5月11日　哥伦比亚首都波哥大
    当我在波哥大的旅馆内参加乡村俱乐部的宴会时，旅馆外那一声声该死的“打倒尼克松”和“打死尼克松”的喊叫声在空中震响。尽管我还强作镇静，毕竟也食不下咽。我的夫人更吓得脸色惨白。她不断地求我（甚至当着哥伦比亚人的面）提早回去。这真是妇人之见。还有委内瑞拉的最后一站我是一定要坚持到底的。
    5月13日　委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯
    比起今天的灾难来，我前些天所受到的不客气的接待简直算不得一回事。我万万想不到委内瑞拉人对我们竟仇恨到这地步！自然我很清楚这个石油国家每年给老板带来三亿美元的巨额利润，平均每个委内瑞拉人得拿出五十美元。而最近我们限制了石油进口，这就等于束紧了约六百万委内瑞拉人的裤腰带。但是，他们也不能发了疯啊！
    如果我曾有过一刹那不羡慕我自己的美国副总统的位置的话，那就是今天！上帝保佑我，我可真吓坏了。
    今天，当我一下飞机，第一眼就看到挂在机场正中的一面巨大的白旗，上面用鲜红的字写着：“再见，尼克松，我们不留你！”我就知道事情不妙。再望过去，机场周围满是密密层层挥舞着反美标语的人群。我正想钻进汽车，人群直拥过来，鸡蛋、番茄、鳄梨和唾沫纷纷向我身上扔来。唾沫竟落到我的脸上和身上，我气得浑身发抖。更叫我痛心的是我的夫人也遭难了。她刚要走上汽车时，一个年青人竟敢一把抓住她的手嚷着：“小石城、小石城的黑人孩子怎么啦”？我的夫人又气又怕，上帝保佑这个妇女居然还保持镇静，并且努力作出笑脸。我佩服她的勇气。上了汽车之后，灾难并没有完结。大批的示威者围着汽车不断扔来石块、手杖、烟袋、罐头和吐来唾沫。我们的汽车一塌糊涂，满身创伤。玻璃窗打烂了，我总算没有受伤，而坐在我旁边的我的翻译弗农·华斯特中校的嘴巴被划破了。“尼克松滚回去，我们忘不了危地马拉。不，我们不要你，拉丁美洲不受美国的干涉。”这些标语刺痛着我的眼睛。我原来准备先到委内瑞拉国家纪念馆，向他们的解放者西蒙·博利瓦坟墓献花圈，来笼络一下人心。但听说那里有四千个示威者，我慌忙取消这一路线。当我打听到美国大使馆周围总算没有示威者时，我命令汽车赶快开进大使馆。
    所有对于委内瑞拉的正式访问的节目都取消了。我不能离开大使馆一步。我期望后天上午十时能够平安地到达华盛顿，阿门！
    5月14日　加拉加斯
    再过十分钟，我就要和我的妻子离开这块燃烧着的土地，如果没有什么意外的话。
    现在，配备着步枪和弯刀的五十名宪兵还守卫在大使馆的周围，我的身边是十几名佩带手枪的特务人员。这个时候，四十九架美国飞机载运着一千名伞兵和海军陆战队已经来到离这里不远的美国基地。尽管如此，从昨天到今天，我实际上是被困在大使馆，无法行动一步。据说在昨天，当我在西半球的委内瑞拉人的包围中汗下如雨时，在遥遥相对的东半球的仰光也发生了反美示威游行。我们的日子很不好过啊。我真不知道自己还有没有勇气下半年再到欧洲去走一遭。在那里，艾克和李奇?都吃过苦头，被群众骂过滚回去！
