Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 25th: The Lebanese northern insurgent people's armed forces have achieved significant victories and are expanding their offensive to control the entire northern Lebanese region north of the Baalbek-Tripoli line.

According to broadcasts this morning from Damascus Radio and the insurgent forces' "Free Lebanon Radio," the People's Army engaged in fierce battles with government troops on the 24th in Halba and Ihden in the Akkar region of northern Lebanon, and in Abdeh in the south. Newspapers reported that Lebanese government authorities used American-piloted aircraft to bomb the People's Army in the northern and southern regions of Lebanon, but "Free Lebanon Radio" stated that the People's Army had taken control of the entire Akkar region after occupying Halba.

Sabri Hamadi, the leader of the Baalbek region insurgency in central Lebanon, has already controlled the areas north and east of Baalbek. On the 23rd, he led insurgent troops with ample captured equipment to Halba, northeast of Tripoli, preparing to join forces with the insurgent troops controlling Tripoli. After the two armies join forces, all Lebanese territory north of the Baalbek-Tripoli line will be under the control of the insurgent forces.

Currently, only the last batch of government troops on the Beirut-Baalbek highway are stubbornly resisting at the American University of Beirut, ten miles from Baalbek. Chamoun's army and gendarmes no longer dare to attack the insurgent forces in Tripoli and Baalbek.

The insurgent forces in the Baalbek region and Tripoli have captured large quantities of weapons from the government army and gendarmes. American-made and French-made weapons seized by the insurgent forces from the government army were displayed in Tripoli.

Fouchalab Yaghi, the acting commander of the insurgent forces in the Baalbek region, also seized fifty rifles, two automatic rifles, three light trucks, and one jeep from the gendarmes.

The situation in Beirut remains tense. According to Beirut Radio on the evening of the 24th, the Lebanese government ordered a curfew in the Beirut area from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.

Chamoun hurriedly consulted with Lebanese Army Commander-in-Chief Shehab on the evening of the 24th, after which an immediate cabinet meeting was held to discuss the current situation. Sources say the government will declare a state of emergency in an attempt to "restore order." The cabinet meeting decided to mobilize and organize militias to assist the government army. This measure is seen as a reflection of the government's lack of confidence in whether its 9,000-strong army will "unconditionally support" the government. It is said that Shehab is unwilling to deploy the entire army for suppression, fearing a split within the military.

According to Damascus newspapers today, Chamoun again met with the US, British, and French ambassadors to Lebanon on the evening of the 24th, urging their governments to intervene in Lebanese internal affairs based on the 1950 Tripartite Declaration by the United States, Britain, and France.

Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt accused Iraq on the 24th of shipping four thousand rifles to the Lebanese government to suppress the people's uprising.

    黎巴嫩起义军扩大攻势
    加紧控制巴尔贝克到的黎波里一线以北全部地区
    新华社大马士革25日电　黎巴嫩北部的起义人民武装部队获得了重大的战果，正在扩大攻势，以控制从巴尔贝克到的黎波里一线以北的整个黎巴嫩北部地区。
    据大马士革电台和起义部队的“自由黎巴嫩电台”今天上午广播，人民军24日在黎巴嫩北部奥卡尔地区的哈勒巴和伊赫登以及南部的阿卜达同政府军队发生了激战。据报纸报道，黎巴嫩政府当局在黎巴嫩北部和南部地区的战斗中使用了由美国人驾驶的飞机轰击那里的人民军，但是，“自由黎巴嫩电台”说，人民军在占领了哈勒巴以后已经控制了整个奥卡尔地区。
    黎巴嫩中部巴尔贝克地区的起义领导者萨布里·哈马迪已经控制了巴尔贝克以北和以东的地区。他已经在23日率领带着充足的缴获的装备的起义部队开往的黎波里东北 的哈勒巴，准备和控制着的黎波里的起义部队会师。两军会师以后，从巴尔贝克到的黎波里一线以北的全部黎巴嫩地区将置于起义部队的控制之下。
  目前，从贝鲁特到巴尔贝克公路上只剩下最后一批政府军在离巴尔贝克十英里的贝鲁特美国大学负隅顽抗。夏蒙的陆军和宪兵已经不敢向的黎波里和巴尔贝克的起义部队进攻。
    巴尔贝克地区和的黎波里的起义部队都缴获了大批政府陆军和宪兵方面的武器。在的黎波里展出了起义部队从政府军缴获的美国造和法国造武器。
    起义部队巴尔贝克代理司令富查来卜·亚吉的部队也从宪兵那里缴获了五十支步枪、两挺自动步枪、三辆轻型卡车和一辆吉普车。
    贝鲁特的局势仍然紧张。据贝鲁特电台24日晚上说，黎巴嫩政府24日下令在贝鲁特地区从晚上八时到次晨五时实行宵禁。
    夏蒙24日晚上慌忙同黎巴嫩陆军总司令谢哈布进行会商，在这以后立即举行了内阁会议讨论了当前的局势。有消息说，政府将宣布紧急状态以图“恢复秩序”。内阁会议决定要动员组织民兵来帮助政府军。这个措施被认为是政府对它的九千人的陆军是否会“无条件地支持”政府缺乏信心的表现。据说谢哈布不肯把陆军全部出动来进行镇压，他害怕军队中将会发生分裂。
    据大马士革报纸今天报道，夏蒙在24日晚上再次会见了美国、英国和法国的驻黎巴嫩大使，要求他们的政府赶紧根据1950年美、英、法三国宣言干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特24日指责说，伊拉克运了四千支步枪给黎巴嫩政府来镇压人民的起义。
