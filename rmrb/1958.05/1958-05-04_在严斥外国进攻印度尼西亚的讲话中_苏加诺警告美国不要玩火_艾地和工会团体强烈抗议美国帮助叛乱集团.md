Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 3rd - Indonesian President Sukarno said on the evening of the 2nd that foreign countries are not only interfering in Indonesia, but also attacking Indonesia.

President Sukarno pointed out in a speech to students and government officials in Bandung that in West Sumatra, there are tens of thousands of American-made weapons and hundreds of American-made heavy weapons, which the rebels cannot afford. President Sukarno pointed out that planes piloted by Americans and elements of Chiang Kai-shek's group from Taiwan have also attacked Indonesian territory.

Sukarno warned the United States in his speech not to play with fire in Indonesia. He said that the current U.S. policy "overemphasizes the interests of the Cold War." He hoped that the United States would "re-evaluate" its policies toward Asia and Indonesia.

Speaking of Indonesia's disappointment with the attitude of the United States, President Sukarno said that it is understandable that the Indonesian people have now turned their expectations to other areas. Many people sympathize with Moscow because Moscow supports Indonesia's demand to recover West Irian. Moscow agrees with the Bandung Afro-Asian Conference's views, and Moscow welcomes Indonesia's pursuit of an independent and active policy. He said, in this case, how can the Indonesian people not sympathize with Moscow?

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 3rd - Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit sent a telegram to the U.S. government on the 2nd, strongly protesting U.S. aid to Indonesian rebel groups, especially helping rebel groups to carry out air raids on some parts of Indonesia. The telegram has been handed over to U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Jones and asked him to forward it to the U.S. government.

Aidit demanded in the telegram that the United States immediately stop providing open or secret assistance to the rebels.

At the same time, many Indonesian people's organizations expressed support for Prime Minister Djuanda's statement condemning the interference of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek's group in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation issued a statement on the 2nd, calling on all members to support the government, oppose the increasingly intensified interference by the United States, strengthen cooperation with the armed forces, and heighten national vigilance. The statement also called on trade unions and workers around the world, especially in Asia and Africa, to strengthen their support for the struggle of the Indonesian people and workers, and to condemn the despicable interference of American imperialists. The statement also called on the government to take action without hesitation to crush the subversive activities of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek's group in Indonesia.

The Central Working Committee of the Indonesian Veterans Legion passed a resolution at a meeting on May 1, expressing support for Prime Minister Djuanda's statement on April 30.

The Oil Workers' Union telegraphed Djuanda on the 2nd on behalf of 35,000 members, expressing support for his statement. The telegram said that Prime Minister Djuanda's statement correctly and clearly exposed the interference activities of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek's group. The union also telegraphed the U.S. government, protesting the aid of American adventurers to rebel groups and the bombing of Indonesian territory.

    苏加诺警告美国不要玩火
    艾地和工会团体强烈抗议美国帮助叛乱集团
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺2日晚上说，外国不仅在对印度尼西亚进行干涉，而且还在进攻印度尼西亚。
    苏加诺总统在对万隆学生和政府官员发表讲话时指出，在西苏门答腊，有数以万计的美国制造的武器和好几百件美国制造的重型武器，而叛乱分子是买不起这些武器的。苏加诺总统指出，由美国人和台湾蒋介石集团分子驾驶的飞机还袭击了印度尼西亚国土。
    苏加诺在讲演中警告美国不要在印度尼西亚玩火。他说，美国目前的政策“过分侧重冷战的利益”。他希望美国“重新估计”它对亚洲和印度尼西亚的政策。
    在谈到印度尼西亚对美国的态度所感到的失望时，苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚人民目前已经把他们的期望转到其他方面去，这是可以理解的。许多人对莫斯科表示同情，因为莫斯科支持印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的要求。莫斯科同意万隆亚非会议的意见，莫斯科欢迎印度尼西亚奉行独立和积极的政策。他说，在这种情况下，印度尼西亚人民怎么能不对莫斯科表示同情呢？
    据新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地2日致电美国政府，强烈抗议美国援助印度尼西亚叛乱集团，特别是帮助叛乱集团空袭印度尼西亚的一些地方。这个电报已经交给了美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯，并要他转交给美国政府。
    艾地在电报中要求美国立即停止对叛乱分子的公开或秘密的帮助。
    同时，许多印度尼西亚人民团体表示支持朱安达总理谴责美国和蒋介石集团分子干涉印度尼西亚内政的声明。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会2日发表声明，号召全体会员支持政府，反对美国日益加紧的干涉，加强同武装部队的合作，提高民族警惕。声明还要求全世界，特别是亚非国家的工会和工人们，加强他们对印度尼西亚人民和工人的斗争的支持，并且谴责美帝国主义者的卑鄙干涉。声明还要求政府毫不迟疑地采取行动粉碎美国和蒋介石集团分子在印度尼西亚的颠复活动。
    印度尼西亚退伍军人团中央工作委员会在5月1日的集会上通过了一项决议，表示支持朱安达总理4月30日的声明。
    石油工人工会2日代表三万五千名会员打电报给朱安达，表示支持他的声明。电报说，朱安达总理的声明正确和清楚地揭露了美国和蒋介石集团分子的干涉活动。这个工会也打电报给美国政府，抗议美国冒险分子帮助叛乱集团和轰炸印度尼西亚领土。
