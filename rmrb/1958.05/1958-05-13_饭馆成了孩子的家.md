　　Last October, my younger son was sent to a nursery, leaving a nine-year-old daughter at home, who is in primary school. Because there wasn't much to do at home, I dismissed the nanny and arranged for her meals at the Xinfengyuan Restaurant in Xizhushikou, not far from our dormitory. At first, I was very worried, afraid that the service staff would be too busy to take care of the child's meals, and also that the child would be greedy and spend too much money. However, the past six months have proven that the service staff at this restaurant have taken very good care of my child. They helped her choose economical and delicious food; she had different dishes for two meals a day, and didn't spend much money.

　　As soon as my daughter walks into Xinfengyuan, it's like she's at home. As soon as she sits down, an uncle or aunt will immediately smile and help her choose a meal that will fill her up for no more than 25 cents. Sometimes the child wants to eat fried pancakes or more expensive stir-fried dishes, but a plate of fried pancakes is too much for her to finish in one meal; a stir-fried dish is too expensive, costing more than 25 cents. The service staff would then save half of the fried pancakes or stir-fried dish for her to eat next time. If the dish wasn't enough for the next meal, they would automatically add a bowl of clear soup.

　　Thanks to the enthusiastic care of the comrades at Xinfengyuan, my child eats well, is in a good mood, and hasn't been sick. Whenever I see her chubby, rosy cheeks, I deeply realize that only under the leadership and education of the Communist Party would restaurant service staff care for other people's children as if they were their own.

### 饭馆成了孩子的家

　　饭馆成了孩子的家
    去年10月，我的小儿子送进了托儿所，家里只剩下一个九岁的女儿，她在上小学。因为家事不多，就辞退了保姆，在离宿舍不远的西珠市口新丰园饭馆给她包了饭。开始的时候，我很不放心，怕服务员同志的业务忙，没有时间照顾孩子吃饭，又怕孩子贪吃花钱多。但是，半年来事实证明，这个饭馆的服务员同志对孩子照顾得非常周到，他们帮助孩子选择既经济又好吃的饭菜；一天两顿饭换着样儿吃，花钱也不多。
    我的女儿一走进新丰园，就好像到了自己家里一样，刚刚坐下，马上就会有一位叔叔或阿姨笑着帮助她选择不超过二角五分就能吃饱的饭菜，有时孩子想吃炒饼或钱多的炒菜，可是一盘炒饼太多，一顿吃不了；一个炒菜太贵，超过了两角五分钱，服务员同志就把一半炒饼或炒菜留起来给她下顿再吃。下顿菜如果不够，就自动的给加一碗高汤。
    由于新丰园的同志们热情照顾，我的孩子吃得好、心情愉快，没有生过病。每当我看到她那胖胖的红脸蛋时，就深深地体会到唯有在共产党领导和教育下，饭馆的服务员同志才会对别人的孩子像对自己的孩子一样的关心和爱护。
