Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 6th: Kalla, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, delivered a report on the Party's cultural policy at the Party Central Political Academy on the 5th. He stated that Hungary has taken the first steps in vigorously raising the cultural level of the people and educating the working masses with the Marxist-Leninist worldview.

In his report, Kalla first described the achievements Hungary has made in the cultural field since liberation. He pointed out that in 1957, there were 1.26 million primary school students, 160,000 middle school students, and 33,000 university students nationwide. About half of the teachers and engineers were trained after liberation. In general, intellectuals trained after liberation account for 30% of the total number of intellectuals in the country.

Kalla then discussed some of the mistakes made by the Party leadership in cultural construction in the past. He pointed out that the Party had neglected regular ideological education work in the past.

When discussing the manifestations of revisionism in the cultural sphere, Kalla said that revisionism is first manifested in vigorously exaggerating past mistakes. Revisionists diminish or even obliterate the great achievements made in the cultural revolution, re-propose the old slogan of bourgeois cultural "freedom" disguised with Marxism-Leninism, and disguise it with Marxist phrases, attacking Lenin's principle of the Party spirit of culture, and denying the necessity of the leadership role of the Party and the state. Secondly, revisionists put forward the slogan of "democracy for all," denying class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thirdly, revisionists one-sidedly emphasize national characteristics and "national roads," abandoning the cultural definition of "socialist content and national form" and replacing it with the nationalist slogan: "culture with national and socialist content." Kalla said that after November 4, 1956, revolutionary forces also launched a counter-offensive on the cultural front. After crushing the counter-revolutionary forces, counter-revolutionaries were forced to retreat in cultural life. However, the influence of counter-revolution has not been completely eliminated. Now the time has come to launch a comprehensive ideological and cultural offensive.

Kalla then pointed out that although new relations of production have been established in Hungary, socialism has not yet triumphed on the ideological and cultural front. He said that completing this task will require a considerable period of time.

When discussing cultural education, Kalla emphasized the importance of conducting moral and political education for young students and cultivating a labor perspective.

Kalla then pointed out that in the fields of literature and art, it is necessary to support the development of socialist cultural buds. To this end, it is very necessary to correctly resolve the anti-Marxist-Leninist views of revisionists such as Lukács on issues such as class struggle, Party spirit, and Party leadership in the summer of 1956.

Kalla also talked about relying primarily on Party member writers in literary and artistic life, while strengthening the unity of Party members and non-Party writers on the basis of principles.

Kalla then pointed out that at present, a certain part of the writers in Hungary hold erroneous views on the three political issues of working class leadership, proletarian dictatorship, and the socialist transformation of agriculture. He said that it is necessary to win over these people, so that some of them can break away from reactionary views and use their works to serve the cause of social progress.

Kalla also talked about the importance of transforming old intellectuals, educating new young intellectuals, and cultivating a group of intellectuals from the working class.

    卡拉伊谈匈社会主义工人党文化政策
    要清除修正主义在文化界的影响
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员卡拉伊5日在党中央政治学院做了关于党的文化政策的报告。他说，匈牙利在大力提高人民文化水平和用马克思列宁主义的世界观教育劳动群众方面已经迈出了第一步。
    卡拉伊在报告中首先叙述了解放以来匈牙利在文化方面所取得的成就。他指出，1957年，全国有一百二十六万名小学生、十六万名中学生和三万三千名大学生。在教师和工程师中，约有一半是解放后培养出来的。整个说来，解放后培养出来的知识分子占全国知识分子总数的30％。
    卡拉伊接着谈到过去党的领导在文化建设方面犯过的一些错误。他指出，党过去曾经忽视了经常的思想教育工作。
    在谈到修正主义在文化界的表现时，卡拉伊说，修正主义首先表现在亟力夸大过去的错误上。修正主义者缩小甚至抹煞文化革命中所取得的伟大成就，重新提出了用马克思列宁主义伪装着的资产阶级文化“自由”的老口号，并且用马克思主义的辞句把它伪装起来，攻击列宁关于文化的党性的原则，否认党和国家的领导作用的必要性。其次，修正主义者提出了“给一切人以民主”的口号，否认阶级斗争和无产阶级专政。第三，修正主义者片面地强调民族特点和“民族道路”，抛弃了“社会主义内容和民族形式”的文化定义，而代之以民族主义的口号：“民族和社会主义内容的文化”。卡拉伊说，1956年11月4日以后，革命力量在文化战线上也发起了反攻。在粉碎了反革命力量以后，反革命分子在文化生活中被迫退却了。但是，反革命的影响并没有完全消除。现在展开一个全面的思想和文化攻势的时期已经到来了。
    卡拉伊接着指出，在匈牙利新的生产关系虽然已经确立，但是在思想和文化战线上社会主义还没有取得胜利。他说要完成这一任务还需要一个相当长的时期。
    卡拉伊在谈到文化教育的时候强调了对青年学生进行道德和政治教育以及培养劳动观点的重要性。
    卡拉伊接着指出，在文学、艺术方面要扶助社会主义文化幼芽的发展。为此，就很有必要正确解决1956年夏天修正主义者们卢卡奇等在阶级斗争、党性和党的领导等问题上的反马克思列宁主义的观点。
    卡拉伊还谈到在文艺生活中，首先要依靠党员作家，同时要加强党员和非党作家在原则基础上的团结。
    卡拉伊接着指出，目前在匈牙利的某一部分作家中在工人阶级的领导作用、无产阶级专政和农业的社会主义改造这三个政治问题上存在着错误的观点。他说，必须争取这些人，使他们中的一些人摆脱反动观点，并且用自己的著作服务于社会进步事业。
    卡拉伊还谈到改造旧知识分子、教育新的年青的知识分子和从工人阶级中培养出一批知识分子的重要性。
