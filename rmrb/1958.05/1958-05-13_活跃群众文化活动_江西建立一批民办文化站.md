　　Jiangxi Establishes a Batch of People-Run Cultural Stations

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 12th – In Jiangxi Province, Yongxiu, Duchang, Xiushui, Ruichang and other counties have recently established thirty-eight people-run cultural stations. Every evening and night, these cultural stations are filled with male and female commune members. Some are reading popular books and newspapers in the library, while others are singing, playing the huqin, and rehearsing small singing performances in the recreation room.

　　These people-run cultural stations were set up after only one or two days of preparation. The equipment is very simple, generally consisting of only two or three hundred popular books, three or five magazines, and some recreational equipment. Some cultural stations have dedicated personnel in charge of management. It doesn't cost much money to establish such cultural stations. The funds come from the commune members' sideline occupations during work breaks, or a small portion is subsidized from the agricultural cooperative's public welfare fund. After the cultural stations were established, they also promoted the central work and production in the countryside.

　　"Lecture Notes on Agricultural Knowledge" Published

　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Shanghai Miaohang Township Agricultural Middle School, which was only established forty days ago, has already compiled and printed a set of two volumes of "Lecture Notes on Agricultural Knowledge," which is now being publicly sold by the Xinhua Bookstore.

　　This new textbook was written by cadres from the Shanghai People's Publishing House and the Science and Technology Publishing House who were sent down to Miaohang Township in the northern suburbs of Shanghai, taking time out of their intense labor. The lecture notes include more than ten units of agricultural basic knowledge such as fertilizer, rice planting, cotton planting, cattle raising, and pig raising. Each chapter has detailed annotations and is rich in illustrations.

    江西建立一批民办文化站
    据新华社南昌12日电  江西省永修、都昌、修水、瑞昌等县农村最近建立了三十八个民办文化站。每天傍晚和夜晚，这些文化站里挤满了男女社员们。他们有的在图书室阅读通俗书报，有的在游艺室唱歌、拉胡琴、排演小演唱节目。
    这些民办文化站都是在筹备了一两天后就办起来的，设备很简单，一般只有二、三百本通俗图书，三、五分杂志，和一些文娱用具。有些文化站有专人负责管理。建立这样的文化站花钱不多，经费是社员们在工余搞副业得来的，或由农业社公益金中补助一小部分。文化站办起来后，也推动了农村中心工作和生产。“农业知识讲义”出版
    据新华社讯　创办才四十天的上海庙行乡的农业中学，已经编印出一套两册“农业知识讲义”，开始由新华书店公开发售。
    这套新课本是由上海人民出版社和科学技术出版社下放到上海北郊区庙行乡的干部在紧张劳动中抽空编写的。讲义内容包括农业基础知识肥料、种稻、植棉、养牛、养猪等十多个单元，每章都有详细注解，图文并茂。
