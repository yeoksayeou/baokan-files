Representatives from five provinces—Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang—and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, among the first 2,300 delegates to visit the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, after five days of diligent observation and learning, believe that they have achieved a great ideological liberation and are confident in further promoting the agricultural tool reform movement.

    Representatives from the Baoding Special District in Hebei Province said that the most important gain from this visit was the ideological liberation. Everyone saw that the various tools created by the masses across the country were simple to make, inexpensive, and highly efficient, solving many problems. After returning, these things should be manufactured and promoted on a large scale. Representatives from Henan Province said that the visit dispelled complacency. In the past four months, Henan manufactured more than 1,100 tools and thought it was doing well. After seeing the exhibition, they felt that they were still not good enough and needed to continue their efforts and reform agricultural tools on a large scale. Representatives from Inner Mongolia said that Inner Mongolia's technological reform was lagging behind because they believed that technology was a matter for a few people and was out of reach. After the visit, they believed that technology was not mysterious and could be done by the broad masses.

    In addition to ideological gains, the representatives from various places selected various tools suitable for their current and future needs and drew a large number of drawings, preparing to imitate and promote them after returning. The representatives from Inner Mongolia selected more than 300 agricultural tools suitable for promotion and use in their region. These included water lifting tools suitable for farmland irrigation in the Hetao area, various soil transportation tools and well-drilling tools for water conservancy construction, some weeding and hoeing machines suitable for pastoral areas, and deep plows suitable for deep plowing. The masses themselves can manufacture about 90% of these 300-plus tools, or they can be manufactured in the region, and only about 10% need to be ordered from other places.

    The visiting representatives from various places are mostly responsible party and government cadres and technicians from iron and woodworking cooperatives from various provinces, special districts, and counties. They all carefully observed and drew detailed diagrams with the attitude of "collecting treasures." They visited during the day and held discussions at night, learning and consolidating bit by bit. Some held on-the-spot meetings to exchange experiences at any time. From the 27th, 2,500 representatives from eight regions, including Liaoning, Anhui, and Yunnan, began their visits and studies.

    内蒙古河北等地代表说：
    参观农展会思想大解放
    本报讯　河北、河南、山西、江苏、黑龙江五省和内蒙古自治区首批参观全国农具展览会的二千三百多名代表，经过五天认真地参观和学习后，认为在思想上获得了大解放，有信心进一步把农具改革运动开展起来。
    河北省保定专区的代表说，这次参观最重要的收获是思想上的解放，大家看到了全国各地群众创造的各式各样的工具简单好造，价钱便宜，效率很高，很解决问题。回去后，这些东西要大量地制造，大量地推广。河南省的代表说，经过参观打掉了自满思想。河南在过去的四个月里，制造了一千一百多件工具，认为自己搞的不错。在展览会上一看，感到自己还不行，需要继续努力，大量地改革农具。内蒙古的代表说，内蒙古的技术改革落后，原因是认为技术是少数人的事情，高不可攀，参观后则认为技术并不是神秘的，是广大群众都可以办到的事情。
    各地参观的代表除思想上的收获外，在会上都选择了适合他们本地区当前和今后需要的各种工具，并绘制了大量的图纸，准备回去仿制推广。内蒙古的代表共选出了三百多件适合他们地区推广使用的农具。其中有适合河套地区农田灌溉用的提水工具，兴修水利用的各种运土工具和打井工具，有的适合牧区用的耧草、锄草机，有的适合深耕用的深耕犁。这三百多件工具90％左右群众自己可以制造或本区可以制造，只有10％左右需要向外地订货。
    各地参观代表多为各省、专、县的党政负责干部和铁木业社的技术人员。他们都以“取宝”的态度，仔细观察详细绘图。他们白天参观，晚上座谈，学习一点巩固一点。有的开阵地会，随时交流经验。从27日起，辽宁、安徽、云南等八个地区的二千五百名代表，开始进行参观学习。
