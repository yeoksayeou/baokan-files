　　A Good Example in the Taihang Mountain Valley
　　Guxian Town Regional Hospital in Qin County Thinks of the Masses in Every Way
　　(Our dispatch) This reporter Shui Tiansheng reports: "Bringing your own rice and flour to stay in the hospital, acupuncture treatment costs little money, and they can do open abdominal surgery, truly a good hospital for the people." This is what the farmers in the Taihang Mountains say in praise of the Guxian Town Regional Hospital in Qin County. Recently, the representatives of this hospital attending the Shanxi Provincial Advanced Producers Conference spread their advanced experiences at the conference. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Health believes that Guxian Town Hospital has set a good example for all hospitals in Shanxi Province.
　　The Guxian Town Regional Hospital in Qin County was established in a small mountain valley in the Taihang Mountains. This hospital works hard and thinks of the masses in every way, which is deeply loved by the people in the mountainous areas. When the hospital was changed from a health center to a regional hospital in 1956, it only had a dilapidated house, two medicine cabinets, and equipment worth four thousand yuan. The staff did not ask the state for money, and decided to run the hospital diligently and thriftily, building while working, and assisted workers in repairing more than 30 houses. They set up operating rooms, acupuncture rooms, nursing rooms, ten beds, and two earth platforms (kang).
　　After the hospital was born in this mountain valley, it took on the task of prevention and medical treatment for nearby villages. With few people and many things to do, all ten employees of the hospital adopted the method of division of labor and cooperation, with both full-time and part-time positions. At the same time, various methods were adopted to solve the difficulties in equipment. Without an operating table, an examination bed was used instead. Originally, there was no oxygen supply device, so doctor Zhang Xiuqing trial-produced a device using salt bottles filled with Mengbu, and then used alcohol to burn and dissolve it to replace the oxygen transfer equipment. All the staff of the hospital were diligent and thrifty in this way, serving the people in the mountainous areas.
　　This hospital also took various measures to reduce the medical expenses of patients. In medical treatment and medication, they also adopted treatment methods of more acupuncture, less medication, and combining acupuncture and medication.
　　The hospital staff also overcame the working style of "slow doctors for acute illnesses" and achieved "being there whenever called." Doctors also carried medicine bags on their backs, climbed mountains and ridges, and went deep into villages and construction sites for mobile medical treatment. In the past year alone, they went deep into 150 villages to treat farmers. They also took time to carry out prevention and treatment of local disease goiter for the local people, and cured most of the patients.

　　太行山沟里的好榜样
　　沁县故县镇地区医院处处为群众着想
    本报讯　记者水天生报道：“自带米面住医院，针灸医疗少花钱，开脏剖肚都能干，真是人民的好医院。”这是太行山区的农民对沁县故县镇地区医院的赞语。最近，这个医院出席山西省先进生产者会议的代表，在会议上传播了先进经验。山西省卫生厅认为故县镇医院为山西省所有的医院树立了良好的榜样。
    沁县故县镇地区医院建立在太行山的一个小山沟里。这个医院艰苦奋斗，处处为群众着想，受到了山区人民的热爱。该院还在1956年由卫生所改为地区医院时，只有一所破烂房子和两个药柜和四千元的设备费。职工没有向国家伸手要钱，决定勤俭办院，边建设、边工作，协助工人修补了三十多间房屋。设置了手术室、针灸室、护理室，十张病床，两盘土炕。
    医院在这个山沟里诞生后，担负附近各乡的预防和医疗任务。在人少事多的情况下，全院十个职工采取分工合作，专任兼职的作法。同时，还采取了各种办法，解决设备上的困难。没有手术床就用检查床代替，原来没有装氧装置，医生张秀清试制了用食盐瓶装入孟卜，再用酒精烧化代替了转氧设备。全院职工就这样克勤克俭，为山区人民服务。
    这个医院还采取种种办法，减轻病人的医疗费用。在医疗、用药上还采取了多针灸，少吃药，针药配合的治疗方法。
    医院职工还克服了“急病慢大夫”的工作作风，做到了“有叫就到”。医生还背上药包，翻山越岭，深入村庄、工地巡回医疗。仅在去年一年内，就深入一百五十个村庄为农民治病。他们还抽空为当地群众进行防止和治疗地方病甲状腺肿，治愈了大部分患者。
