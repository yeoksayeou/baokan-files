In the four months, Henan Province put into production more than 6,000 newly built enterprises, including more than 4,000 iron and wood factories and machinery repair factories; in addition, there are more than 70,000 industrial production units run by agricultural cooperatives (of which more than 60,000 produce granular fertilizer). The industrial production units put into production in Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces in the four months (including those run by agricultural cooperatives) were 30,000 and 10,000 respectively.

The retail sales of commodities in 31 large and medium-sized cities across the country increased by 5.6% compared with the previous month. The commodity inventories of state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative commerce in these cities increased by 3% compared with the previous month and 37% compared with the same period last year.
