    Stop Building Record Factories

    Based on our factory's existing equipment capacity, we can produce 210,000 record players a year. However, due to insufficient raw material supply, we can only produce 60,000 this year. Records are also experiencing sluggish sales, and we recently changed from a three-shift (day and night) production schedule to a single-shift production schedule.

    Our factory's production capacity cannot be fully utilized, yet five places, including Hengyang, Chengdu, Anhui, Luoyang, and Kaifeng, have recently sent people to our factory to learn the record player production process, preparing to return and build record player factories. As far as I know, building a record player factory with an annual output of 30,000 units requires an investment of at least 600,000 yuan. To save the state's investment and enable existing record player factories to fully utilize their production capacity, I suggest that the aforementioned regions consider reducing the construction of record player factories. If they need record players and records, they can place orders with our factory.

    不要再建立唱片厂了
    根据我们厂现有的设备能力，一年能产二十一万架唱机。但是，由于原材料供应不足，今年只能生产六万架。唱片也因为滞销，最近把日夜三班生产改为一班生产。
    我们一个厂的生产能力还不能充分发挥，然而，最近衡阳、成都、安徽、洛阳和开封等五个地方先后派人来我厂学习唱机生产过程，准备回去建立唱机工厂。据我了解，建立一个年产三万架唱机的唱机工厂，至少要投资六十万元，为了节省国家投资，使现有唱机厂充分发挥生产能力，我建议上述地区考虑削减建立唱机工厂，如果他们需要唱机、唱片可向我厂订货。
