    Absurd to the Extreme
    Dulles publicly clamored at a press conference on May 20 that the United States could "take action" against Lebanon based on the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He further explained that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" includes several clauses, and even if one clause does not apply to Lebanon, there is always one that can.
    Of course, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is something the United States created itself, and Dulles can interpret it however he wants. However, the people of the Middle Eastern countries have never recognized any clause of this aggressive "doctrine." No matter which clause the United States uses to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, it is illegal. Moreover, no matter how many clauses the "Eisenhower Doctrine" includes, none of them fit the current situation in Lebanon. Today, the Lebanese people have risen up in arms, and what they oppose is precisely the "Eisenhower Doctrine" itself. May I ask Dulles, can this also become an excuse for the United States to take action by invoking the "Eisenhower Doctrine"? Dulles wants to use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to save the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which is as absurd as someone trying to lift themselves up by pulling their own hair.

    荒唐之至
    杜勒斯在5月20日记者招待会上公开叫嚷说，美国可以根据“艾森豪威尔主义”对黎巴嫩“采取行动”。他并且解释说，“艾森豪威尔主义”包括几个条款，即使某一个条款对黎巴嫩不适用，但是总有一个条款可以适用。
    当然，“艾森豪威尔主义”是美国自己制造的东西，杜勒斯要怎么解释就可以怎么解释。可是中近东各国人民却从来没有承认这个侵略“主义”的任何条款。不管美国根据哪一条来干涉中近东国家内政，都是非法的。何况，不管“艾森豪威尔主义”包括多少条款，毕竟没有任何一条会符合今天黎巴嫩的情况。今天黎巴嫩人民揭竿而起，他们所反对的恰恰就是“艾森豪威尔主义”本身。试问杜勒斯，难道这也可以成为美国援用“艾森豪威尔主义”采取行动的借口吗？杜勒斯想用“艾森豪威尔主义”来挽救“艾森豪威尔主义”，这真像有人抓自己的头发想把自己提起来一样的荒唐。
