Hydroelectric Power Primary, Thermal Power Secondary
Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power to Survey and Design Over a Hundred Engineering Projects

(Our dispatch) The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently decided to vigorously strengthen the survey and design of hydroelectric power stations as an important measure to implement the future development policy of the power industry, which is "hydroelectric power as the primary source and thermal power as the secondary source."

This year, the ministry plans to carry out survey and design work on a total of one hundred and fourteen hydropower projects. Among them, fifty-six projects are to prepare for construction this year, while the remaining fifty-eight projects are in preparation for vigorously developing hydroelectric power stations during the second and third five-year plans. The total installed capacity of these hydropower projects will reach more than 18.8 million kilowatts.

China's largest river, the Yangtze River, is the focus of survey and design this year. Currently, there are twelve hydropower station sites on the main stream and tributaries of this river that are undergoing vigorous surveys. The planning work for the famous Three Gorges Hub Project on the Yangtze River has been largely completed, and data collection for preliminary design will begin this year. The dam sites of the Danjiangkou in Hubei, Wujiangdu in Guizhou, Wan'an in Jiangxi, and Zhexi and Wuqiangxi in Hunan, all with an installed capacity of over 300,000 kilowatts, will also enter the dam body selection stage this year. The preliminary designs of the Danjiangkou and Zhexi hydropower stations can be completed ahead of schedule this year.

Of the forty-six cascade stages stipulated in the overall plan for the Yellow River, in addition to the Sanmenxia Hub Project already under construction, twelve dam sites are also undergoing intensive survey and design. Among them, the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, which has a design capacity second only to Sanmenxia, can complete its preliminary design in the first half of this year. The preliminary surveys of Renjiadui, downstream of Sanmenxia, and Wanjiazhai, near Baotou, will be completed this year, and the preliminary design can be submitted one year ahead of schedule next year, earlier than originally planned.

In addition, it has been decided that ninety hydropower stations will be surveyed and designed this year. They are distributed on more than sixty rivers spanning China's vast territory, from the Pearl River in the south to the Heilongjiang River in the north, from the Fuchun River in the east to the Kashgar River in Xinjiang in the west. The smallest power generation capacity is only a few thousand kilowatts, and the largest can reach more than 1.5 million kilowatts. After these hydropower stations are completed, they will not only generate a large amount of cheap electricity, but also have benefits such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation. According to incomplete statistics, after all the hydropower stations surveyed and designed this year are completed, the irrigated area nationwide alone can be expanded by more than 200 million mu.

China is the country with the richest hydropower resources in the world, with a total reserve of 540 million kilowatts. The hydropower resources of the rivers in the Yangtze River system alone are more than the total hydropower resources of the entire United States. Moreover, due to superior natural conditions, uniform distribution of resources, and good topography and geology, the construction volume of hydropower stations is small, the cost is low, and the construction time can be accelerated. The cost of hydropower is also one-fifth to one-tenth lower than that of thermal power. Therefore, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy of "hydropower as the primary source" for the development of the power industry at the beginning of this year, it has been widely supported by the masses of people across the country, who generally believe that this is an important way to develop China's power industry at a high speed, realize the electrification of urban and rural areas in China, and enable the power industry to catch up with the United Kingdom in fifteen years.

In order to realize this major measure, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has formulated a series of specific measures. The original survey and design forces belonging to both water conservancy and hydropower will be unified and adjusted to ensure the progress of major engineering projects. At the same time, it is prepared to rely on the local survey and design forces to complete some small and medium-sized hydropower stations. Many improvements have also been made in the methods and procedures of survey and design. Large hydropower stations with a capacity of more than 500,000 kilowatts, which originally took more than four years to survey and design, can now be completed in only fifteen to seventeen months; hydropower stations with a capacity of less than 100,000 kilowatts can be completed in less than one year. The conference of survey and design institute directors held in Beijing not long ago also decided to boldly adopt technological innovations so that the average cost per kilowatt of hydropower stations surveyed and designed during the second five-year plan will be reduced by more than 50% compared to the hydropower stations built during the first five-year plan. In other words, the cost that could only build one hydropower station in the past can now build at least two hydropower stations.

### 水电为主　火电为辅  水利电力部将勘察设计百多个工程项目

　　水电为主　火电为辅
    水利电力部将勘察设计百多个工程项目
    本报讯　水利电力部最近作出决定，将以大力加强水电站的勘测设计作为贯彻今后以“水电为主、火电为辅”的电力工业发展方针的重要措施。
    今年这个部计划进行勘测设计的水力发电工程项目共有一百十四个，其中除了五十六个是为今年施工的工程作准备外，其余五十八项都是为第二和第三个五年计划期间大力发展水电站准备的。这些水电工程的总发电设备容量共达一千八百多万瓩。
    我国最大的河流——长江是今年进行勘测设计的重点。目前，这条河流的干支流上正在大力进行勘测的水电站地址共有十二个，著名的长江三峡枢纽工程的规划工作已大体完成，今年开始为初步设计搜集资料。装机容量都在三十万瓩以上的湖北的丹江口、贵州的乌江渡、江西的万安和湖南的柘溪、五强溪等水电站的坝址，今年也都要进入坝体选定阶段。其中丹江口和柘溪两水电站的初步设计在今年都可提前完成。
    黄河综合规划规定的四十六个梯级，现在除已在施工的三门峡枢纽工程外，还有十二个坝址也都已在进行紧张的勘测设计。其中设计能力仅次于三门峡的刘家峡水电站，今年上半年就可以完成初步设计。三门峡下游的任家堆、包头附近的万家寨今年在初步勘测完毕以后，明年也可以比原定计划提前一年提出初步设计。
    除此以外，决定在今年进行勘测设计的水电站还有九十个。它们分布在纵横我国广大国土的六十多条河流上。南自珠江北至黑龙江、东从富春江、西到新疆的喀什河。最小的发电能力只有几千瓩，最大的可达一百五十万瓩以上。这些水电站建成以后，不但可以发出大量廉价的电力，同时还有防洪、灌溉、航运等效益。据不完全统计今年勘测设计的水电站全部建成后，仅全国灌溉的面积就可扩大二万万亩以上。
    我国是世界上水力资源最丰富的国家，总蕴藏量达五亿四千万瓩。其中仅长江水系各河流的水力资源，就比美国全国的水力资源还多。而且由于自然条件优越，资源的分布均匀，地形地质也很好，水电站建筑工程量小，造价便宜，建设时间可以加快。水电的成本又比火电低五分之一到十分之一。因此，中共中央在今年年初提出今后电力工业的发展以“水电为主”的方针以后，得到了全国各地广大群众的拥护和支持，普遍认为这是高速度发展我国电力工业，实现我国城乡电气化和使电力工业在十五年内赶上英国的重要途径。
    为了实现这一重大措施，目前水利电力部已经制定了一系列的具体办法。原有属于水利和水电两方面的勘测设计力量，都将统一调整使用，保证重大工程项目的进度，同时准备把一部分中小型的水电站，依靠地方的勘测设计力量来完成。在勘测设计的方法和程序方面，也进行了很多改进，使原来需要四年多才能勘测设计完的五十万瓩以上的大水电站，现在只需十五到十七个月就能完成；十万瓩以下的水电站不需一年就能完成。不久以前在北京举行的勘测设计院长会议还作出决定，要大胆地采用技术革新，使第二个五年计划期间勘测设计的水电站，平均每瓩的造价要比第一个五年计划期间建设的水电站降低50％以上。也就是说，原来只能建设一个水电站的费用，今后至少可建二个水电站。
