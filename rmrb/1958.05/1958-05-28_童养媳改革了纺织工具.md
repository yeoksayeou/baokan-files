    Child brides in the old society, how easy was it for the people to create inventions? But more than six hundred years ago, a child bride named Huang Daopo, reformed our country's textile tools in her long-term labor.
    Huang Daopo was born in Wunijing, Songjiang Prefecture (now within Jiangsu Province) at the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty. Due to the hardship of life and in order to resist the abuse of her parents-in-law and husband, Huang Daopo fled her hometown and drifted to Yazhou (Yaxian County, the southern end of Hainan Island). There, she learned from the Li people how to use cotton-making tools and weave Yazhou quilts, and returned to her hometown in 1296. After returning to her hometown, she passed on the tools of cotton ginning, spinning, and weaving, such as "bows, gins, spindles, and looms" to the people of her hometown.
    Before Huang Daopo returned to her hometown, the people of Songjiang were very poor because of the poor tools and methods, and the low production technology, and the products were rough. Therefore, people's lives were very poor. Because Huang Daopo reformed the textile technology and established a new set of methods from cotton seed removal to weaving, it not only improved the lives of the local people, but also powerfully promoted the textile handicraft industry in Songjiang, Qingpu and other places, laying a good foundation for China's cotton weaving industry in the Jiangnan area.

    童养媳改革了纺织工具
    旧社会，人民群众要创造发明谈何容易。但是在六百多年前，一个名叫黄道婆的童养媳，却在自己长期的劳动中，革新了我国的纺织工具。
    黄道婆出生于宋末元初时，松江府乌泥泾（今江苏省内）人。由于生活困苦和为了反抗公婆与丈夫的虐待，黄道婆便逃离了家乡，流落到崖州（海南岛南端的崖县）。在那里向黎人学会了用制棉工具和织崖州被的方法，在1296年返回了故乡。回乡以后，把弹花、纺织、织布的工具“捍、弹、纺、织”等传给家乡群众。
    黄道婆回乡以前，松江地方人民因为工具和方法不良，生产技术低劣，产品粗粝。因此人民生活很贫困，由于黄道婆革新了纺织技术，建立了从去棉籽到织布过程的一套新的方法，不但提高了当地人民生活，有力推动了松江、青浦等地的纺织手工业，使我国棉织业在江南地带奠定了良好的基础。
