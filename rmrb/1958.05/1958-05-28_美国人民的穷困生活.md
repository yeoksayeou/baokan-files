Xinhua News Agency, May 27th Dispatch from New York:

    The Heavy Burden of Oppressive Taxes
    Currently averaging $658 per person

According to a report by United Press International reporter Shortel on May 27th, citing materials from the Tax Foundation, the current average tax burden per person in the United States is $658, reaching an unprecedented peak.

Shortel said that of this $658, $468 is collected by the federal government, $101 by state governments, and $89 by local governments. In 1915, the total tax burden per person in the United States was only $25; in 1940, it was $100; and in the first year after the war, it was $375.

    Rural Areas Shrouded in Recession
    Even farmers in productive areas are in trouble

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th Dispatch from New York: The American magazine "The Nation" published an article on May 3rd entitled "Farmers in Trouble," stating that the current situation in rural America is reminiscent of "the scenes of the economic depression of the 1930s."

The article cites materials pointing out that in 1957, the total net income of American farm households fell from $23.1 billion to $20.2 billion. According to the index in mid-March of this year, the prices of agricultural products were still 8.5% lower than the level in 1952. However, agricultural costs increased by 5%.

The article points out that this recession in rural areas is unavoidable even in some productive areas. For example, the southwest and west of Minnesota, where the land is most fertile and there has never been a crop failure, are experiencing "unparalleled distress and poverty." In total, Minnesota's net agricultural income in 1957 fell by nearly $20 million, while agricultural costs increased by $2.8 million. In some areas, crop income fell by 13%.

Unable to make a living, American farmers are leaving the countryside in droves. According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, between April 1956 and April 1957, the rural population decreased by 1,861,000 people, a decrease of 8%. From 1950 to 1957, the rural population decreased from 25,058,000 to 20,396,000, a decrease of 18.6%.

    Increased Savings are a Myth
    Many families are in debt rather than saving

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th Dispatch from Washington: The "Economic Review" magazine published by the AFL-CIO on May 26th exposed the myth of the U.S. government's claim of a "huge increase" in the savings of the American people.

The magazine said that the average savings of ordinary workers in the United States is currently less than $250, and millions of Americans have no savings at all. As for those Americans who have lost their jobs or had their working hours reduced, they are also spending their past savings and starting to go into debt. The claim that Americans have "increased savings" is a "bitter mockery."

    美国人民的穷困生活
    苛捐杂税重如山
    目前平均每人负担658美元
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：据合众国际社记者肖特耳27日引用赋税基金会的材料说，美国目前平均每人的捐税负担是六百五十八美元，达到空前未有的高峰。
    肖特耳说，在这六百五十八美元当中，有四百六十八美元是联邦政府征收的，一百零一美元是州政府征收，八十九美元是地方政府征收。而在1915年，美国平均每人的全部捐税负担只是二十五美元，1940年是一百美元，战后的第一年是三百七十五美元。
    农村笼罩不景气
    即使丰产区农民也陷入困境
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：美国“民族”周刊5月3日发表一篇题为“陷入困境的农民”的文章说，目前美国的农村情况使人想起“三十年代经济萧条时期的景象”。
    文章引用材料指出，在1957年，美国农户全部净收入从二百三十一亿美元下降到二百零二亿美元。根据今年3月中旬的指数，农产品的价格仍比1952年的水平低8.5％。但是农业费用却增加了5％。
    文章指出，农村这种不景气情况即使在一些丰产区也不能幸免，例如在明尼苏达州土地最为肥沃、从未发生过歉收的西南部和西部那里也正经历着“无比的忧患和贫困”。总计1957年明尼苏达州农业净收入下降将近二千万美元，而农业费用却增加了二千八百美元。有些地区的农作物的收入下降了13％。
    由于无法生活下去，美国农民正纷纷离开农村。据美国人口调查局的报告说：在1956年4月到1957年4月之间，农村人口减少了一百八十六万一千人，就是说减少了8％。从1950年到1957年，农村人口从二千五百零五万八千人减少到二千零三十九万六千人，下降了18.6％。
    储蓄增加是神话
    许多人家不是存钱而是欠债
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：“劳联—产联”出版的“经济评论”杂志26日揭穿美国政府所谓美国人民的储蓄有“巨大增加”的神话。
    这家杂志说，目前美国的普通工人平均每人的储蓄不到二百五十美元，数以百万计的美国人甚至还完全没有储蓄。至于那些失了业或者工作时间被削减的美国人，他们也正在花完过去的储蓄而开始负债。所谓美国人“储蓄增加”的说法真是一个“刻薄的嘲弄”。
