　　Ways to Make Clothes Last Longer
  　Xu Anquan
    Paying attention to protecting clothes and making them last longer can not only save personal expenses but also save the country's consumption of cotton cloth. In addition to frequent friction, the damage to clothes is mainly due to the corrosion of cloth by sweat stains and other excretions from the human body.
    To make clothes last longer, it is necessary not only to make the clothes fit well and pay attention to preventing wear and tear (such as adding an old jacket or work clothes to the outer garment; people who often lie on the table to write or work should wear sleeves), but also to extend the wearing time of clothes by changing and washing them frequently and washing them properly.
    Human skin is constantly secreting sweat, and some of the sweat is quickly absorbed by the fibers of the clothes. In addition to containing 98% water, sweat also contains fat, uric acid, salt, etc. These things corrode the fibers of cotton cloth. Therefore, if the underwear we wear is not changed and washed frequently, it is easily corroded and torn. Some people think that frequent changing and washing of clothes can easily damage them, which is not correct. Because clothes worn for a long time are not only easily corroded by sweat stains, but also the grease, dust and other things that are stained will harden the soft clothes and make them easily worn. At the same time, the grease sticking to the clothes will also rot the clothes. Therefore, frequent changing and washing and proper washing can make the clothes last longer.
    There are several ways to wash clothes. Some people wet the clothes with water and put them on a stone and beat them with a wooden stick. This can only remove some of the dust from the clothes and cannot remove sweat stains, oil stains, and fruit juice from the clothes. Due to the forceful beating, the firmness of the fibers will also be damaged over time. Some people use hard brushes to scrub when washing clothes, which is also most likely to damage the fibers of the clothes. Some people also like to soak the clothes in water for one or two days before washing them. This method is also not good, because the fibers are easily damaged by being immersed in water for a long time.
    The best way to wash clothes is to wash the clothes in clean water first to remove dust, etc., then apply soap and rub evenly, leave for about half an hour, and then rub. This will easily remove general sweat, grease, etc., and finally rinse with clean water. If there are many clothes, you can first put a little soda ash in hot water, dissolve the soap in hot water, then soak the clothes in it and stir, then gently rub them with your hands, wash them, squeeze out the water slightly, and finally rinse them with clean water.

　　使衣服耐穿的办法
  　徐安全
    平常注意保护衣服，使衣服多穿一些时间，不但可以节省个人开支，同时也可以节省国家棉布的消耗。衣服的损坏，除了由于经常的摩擦外，主要是人体排泄的汗渍等腐蚀了布。
    使衣服耐穿，不但要把衣服做得合适，和注意防止摩损（如在外衣上加旧罩衫或工作服，经常伏在桌上写字、工作的人，做一副套袖等），而且应该从勤换勤洗和洗法得当来延长衣服穿用的时间。
    人的皮肤经常不断地在分泌汗液，一部分汗液很快地被衣服的纤维吸收。由于汗液中除了含98％的水分外，尚有脂肪、尿酸、盐分等。这些东西，都会腐蚀棉布的纤维。所以我们穿的内衣，如果不常换洗，就容易被腐烂、撕破。有些人认为衣服常换洗容易损坏，这是不对的。因为衣服穿的时间长了，不但易被汗渍腐蚀，而且沾染的油腻、灰尘等东西，会使柔软的衣服变硬而容易被摩破，同时油腻粘在衣服上，也会腐烂衣服，因此勤换勤洗和洗衣得法，就能使衣服耐穿。
    洗衣服的方法有好几种。有人用水把衣服沾湿后，放在石头上用木棒打，这样只能除去衣服上沾染的一部分灰尘，不能把衣服上的汗渍、油渍和果汁等除去。由于用力捶击，时间长了也会损伤纤维的牢固。有人洗衣服时用硬刷子刷洗，这样也最容易损伤衣服的纤维。还有人喜欢把衣服放在水中浸一、二天后再洗，这种办法也不好，因为纤维受到水的长时间的浸渍而易损坏。
    最好的洗衣方法，是把衣服先在清水中洗一遍，将灰尘等洗去，然后再用肥皂涂抹揉匀后放上半小时左右再揉搓，这样就容易使一般的汗液、油垢等除去，最后再用清水洗净。如果衣服多，可以先在热水内放少许纯碱，并把肥皂溶化在热水里，然后将衣服泡在里面，并搅动，然后轻轻地用手揉搓，洗净后稍微压去水分，最后再用清水漂洗就可以了。
