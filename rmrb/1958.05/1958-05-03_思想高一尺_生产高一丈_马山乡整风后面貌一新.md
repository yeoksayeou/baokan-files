Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th - Through the rectification movement, Mashan Township in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, has ushered in a brand-new situation of "thoughts rise one foot, production leaps ten feet."

Before the rectification movement, the work in Mashan Township was relatively backward, and the cadres and commune members were not very motivated. In February, the original plan was to accumulate 200 dan of fertilizer per week, but only half of it was actually completed. Commune members reflected that the cadres had "too much of two things and too little of one": too much time spent going to the streets and sitting in teahouses, too much time spent sleeping in late, and too little time spent on production. After studying this situation, the township Party committee decided to launch a rectification movement throughout the township to mobilize the masses to speak out freely. The commune members exposed many problems, from the work style of cadres, business management, extravagance and waste, to the illegal and undisciplined behavior of individual cadres. At the beginning, commune members wrote big-character posters to the cadres, and later, commune members also started writing to each other. Cai Dixiu, a member of Xingsheng Cooperative, never went to the fields. Her son, Zhang Wanbao, personally drew a cartoon and secretly posted it at the door of her house at night. It read: "Telling you to work but you don't, using your soles to loaf on the job; telling you to produce but you don't, trying every means to be lazy; if you don't work now, you'll drink the north wind in the future."

The township and cooperative Party organizations organized debates based on the opinions of the masses, and immediately and thoroughly corrected what should be corrected. Now, the cadres in the township have changed their appearance. They take production tools with them whenever they go out and take the lead in everything.

### 思想高一尺  生产高一丈  马山乡整风后面貌一新

    思想高一尺  生产高一丈
    马山乡整风后面貌一新
    据新华社武汉30日电　通过整风运动，湖北江陵县马山乡出现了思想高一尺、生产高一丈的崭新局面。
    整风以前，马山乡工作比较落后，干部和社员干劲不大。2月间，原来计划每周积肥二百担，实际只完成了一半。社员反映干部有“两多一少”：上街坐茶馆的多，睡早床的多，搞生产的少。研究了这种情况，乡党委决定在全乡开展整风运动，发动群众大鸣大放。社员们从干部作风、经营管理、铺张浪费一直到个别干部的违法乱纪，揭发出了许多问题。开始的时候，社员给干部写大字报，后来，社员之间也互相写开了。兴胜社社员蔡迪秀，一贯不下田，她的儿子张万宝亲自画了一张漫画，晚上偷偷地贴在家门口，上写着：“叫你上工不上工，拿着鞋底磨洋工；叫你生产不生产，千方百计想偷懒；现在不做工，将来喝北风。”
    乡、社党组织根据群众意见组织辩论，应改的立即狠狠地改。现在，乡里干部变了样了，一出门就带上了生产工具，事事带头干。
