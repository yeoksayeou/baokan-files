Farmers' Labor Enriches Agricultural Science
	Wang Baojing Hired as Research Fellow
	(Our Newspaper) News: Wang Baojing, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model and director of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, has been hired as a special research fellow at the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Institute. This was announced by Li Ping, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Institute, at a meeting of cooperative cadres held in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative on the 15th. Yu Qibao, member of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Institute, and Kang Di, vice president of the Northwest Agricultural College, attended the meeting to congratulate Wang Baojing.
	Wang Baojing is twenty-seven years old this year. He and the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative he leads have made great achievements in the breeding of varieties and scientific cultivation experiments for crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton in recent years. They have selected and cultivated as many as seven or eight varieties of crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton, and are currently testing 112 varieties of wheat. In addition, they are continuing to experiment with double cropping of wheat and cotton, and cultivation techniques for a yield of 5,500 jin of grain per mu. This spring, Wang Baojing proposed to experiment with a yield of 5,500 jin per mu, which some people did not believe. He went to Northwest Agricultural College to study with professors. After returning to the cooperative, he plowed one mu of land to a depth of one chi and five cun, and applied thirty large carts of manure, and selected excellent corn and sweet potato seeds. Through the above-mentioned scientific and technological research activities, the entire cooperative has trained 25 members with certain scientific and technological knowledge. These people have generally learned the techniques of sexual and asexual hybridization of various crops. Due to their active learning and application of agricultural science and technology cultivation methods, the yield of grain crops has been continuously improved, with the highest yield per unit area reaching more than 2,300 jin. The total grain output of the entire cooperative has also increased by two times compared with the pre-liberation period.
	Wang Baojing humbly accepted the appointment. He said at the meeting: "My being hired as a special research fellow at the Provincial Agricultural Science Institute is an honor for the entire cooperative, and it is due to the leadership of the Party and the support of scientific research institutions. In the future, we will have more opportunities to learn."

    农民的劳动创造丰富了农业科学
    王保京被聘为科学研究员
    本报讯　著名全国的农业劳动模范、陕西省醴泉县烽火农业社主任王保京，已经被聘请为陕西省农业科学研究所特约研究员，这是由陕西省农业科学研究所副所长李平15日在烽火农业社召开的社干部会上宣布的。中国科学院陕西分院院务委员、陕西省农业科学研究所所长俞启葆、西北农学院副院长康迪等都到会祝贺王保京。
    王保京今年二十七岁。他和他领导的烽火农业社，近年来在小麦、玉米和棉花等作物品种培育和科学耕作试验方面，取得了很大的成绩。他们选育和培育出来的小麦、玉米和棉花等作物品种，达七、八种之多；正在试种的小麦品种有一百一十二种。另外，他们还在继续试验麦棉两熟和亩产五千五百斤粮食的耕作技术。今年春，王保京提出了要试验亩产五千五百斤，有些人不相信。他去西北农学院同教授们作了研究。回社后把一亩地翻了一尺五寸深，又上了三十大车粪，并且选了优良的玉米和红薯种子等。通过上述科学技术研究活动，全社已经培养了具有一定科学技术知识的社员二十五名。这些人一般都学会了各种作物的有性和无性杂交。由于他们积极学习和运用农业科学技术耕作方法，粮食作物的产量得到不断提高，单位面积产量最高的已经达到二千三百多斤。全社的粮食总产量也比解放前提高了两倍。
    王保京谦虚地接受了这个聘请。他在会上说：“我被聘请为省农业科学研究所的特约研究员，这是全社的光荣，是由于党的领导和科学研究机关的支持。今后我们就有了更多的学习机会。”
