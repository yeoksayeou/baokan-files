Agricultural Production Must Adapt to Industrial Production
Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, Chu Fengqi
Develop Agriculture, Guarantee Supply

The task of Liaoning Province to "achieve self-sufficiency in grain, pork, and vegetables within one year" was proposed and determined at the Provincial Rural Work Conference held by the Provincial Party Committee in early March this year. This is a concrete manifestation of the Party Central Committee's general guideline of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way on the agricultural front of our province. At the same time, it is also a fighting goal put forward boldly on the basis of ideological liberation after repeatedly and continuously fighting against right-leaning conservative thinking.

Under the correct leadership of the Central Government, our Liaoning Province has made great achievements in developing agricultural production in recent years. However, compared with the development of industrial production and the growth rate of the urban population in our province, it is very incompatible. The urban population of our province was 4.03 million in 1952 and increased to 8.4 million in 1957, an increase of more than double in five years. In terms of agricultural production, grain output in 1957 increased by only 21% compared to 1952; the number of live pigs increased by only 15%; and the sown area of vegetables increased by 86% in five years. Agricultural production is obviously lagging behind. This has made the original situation of supply falling short of demand even more tense, and the deficit is widening. In recent years, the state has needed to supply about 1.2 million tons of grain annually and transfer about 20,000 tons of pork and about 80,000 tons of vegetables from fraternal provinces to barely make ends meet. This not only increases a lot of burden on the state and causes great losses, but also affects the normal supply to consumers, affects the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, affects the high-speed development of industry, and puts much of our work in a passive state. We have calculated the following accounts: the grain, pork, and vegetables that the state transfers to our province from other places every year require more than 50,000 train carriages; the state loses more than 20 million yuan annually in managing these materials; if the 1.2 million tons of grain and 20,000 tons of pork supplied to our province by the state were used for export, they could be exchanged for more than 1 million tons of steel. Because a large amount of grain is transferred from other places, the people of our province often change their food varieties due to the harvests of other provinces. If Jilin and Heilongjiang have good harvests, they will eat more coarse grains; if the provinces in North China have good harvests, they will eat more white flour; if the provinces in South China have good harvests, they will eat more indica rice. Consumers often have no choice in the variety of food, which is a major complaint. Therefore, whether it is from the perspective of reducing the state's burden, supporting the high-speed development of industry, or improving people's lives, striving to achieve "three self-sufficiencies" as soon as possible has become an extremely urgent and realistic task on the agricultural production front of our province.

The goal of "three self-sufficiencies" was put forward relatively early, but there was a process of ideological struggle in adopting what speed to achieve this goal. Not long ago, we still wanted to spend three or even five years to achieve this goal. At that time, we were still bound by various right-leaning conservative ideas. In the past, we only saw that the proportion of industry in our province was large, the urban population was large, and the demand for staple and non-staple foods was increasing rapidly. Agricultural production was affected by natural conditions, and the growth was not fast and not stable. We underestimated the potential for agricultural production increase, and underestimated the enthusiasm and creative power of the peasants who had been liberated after cooperation; in the past, we only passively saw that the leadership was concentrating on industry and not taking enough care of agriculture, and did not pay attention to the very favorable side of using industrial forces to support agriculture for the development of agricultural production; in addition, there was also the fear of "rash advance" due to the lack of correct assessment of past work, the idea of "only conditions" in areas with poor natural conditions, and the complacency of being content with the status quo in areas with better conditions or foundations, etc. It is precisely because of the existence of these ideological obstacles that the scale and speed of the agricultural production upsurge in our province last winter were far behind many fraternal provinces. At the Provincial Rural Work Conference held in early March of this year, based on the Central Government's spirit of criticizing "anti-rash advance" and going all out and aiming high, and combined with the enthusiasm of the masses mobilized after the rectification movement, we thoroughly examined and criticized the conservative thinking of leaders at all levels. The task of "three self-sufficiencies in one year" was proposed and passed under the circumstances of further overcoming right-leaning tendencies, liberating thinking, boosting morale, and enhancing confidence. At the same time, based on the specific conditions of our province, we also proposed "water conservancy in two years, greening in three years, and mechanization and electrification in five years" as the specific fighting goals in our province for "fighting hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of production." Therefore, it can be said that "three self-sufficiencies in one year" is the victorious result of the "double anti" movement of rectification, and the product of great ideological liberation.

Task is Arduous, Implementation is Based
The task of achieving "three self-sufficiencies" in one year in our province is very arduous, but through hard work and good work, there is a full basis for achieving this goal. First of all, the quantity required to achieve "three self-sufficiencies" in production is: 9 million tons of grain, 8 million pigs, and 6 million tons of vegetables. These quantities represent increases of 34.3%, 70%, and 28% respectively compared to the actual completion figures in 1957. Can such a large increase in production be achieved? In terms of grain, we have calculated two accounts: one is the account of production increase measures. The main measures we implement to increase production are: (1) Vigorously develop farmland water conservancy. This year, it is planned to expand the irrigated area by 1.9 million hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu), of which 360,000 hectares of new paddy fields will be opened. Calculated at an increase of 1.5 tons per hectare, it can increase production by 540,000 tons; the irrigated area will be expanded by 1.54 million hectares, with 500,000 hectares benefiting significantly. Calculated at an increase of 0.5 tons per hectare, it can increase production by 250,000 tons. The two items total an increase of 790,000 tons. (2) Increase the application of manure fertilizer. This year, it is planned to expand the fertilizer application area by 1.2 million hectares, with an increase of 0.4 tons per hectare, which can increase production by 480,000 tons; the unit fertilizer application rate will increase by half compared to last year, with an increase of 0.3 tons per hectare, which can increase production by 900,000 tons. The two items total 1.38 million tons. (3) Expand the planting area of high-yield crops by 1 million hectares, of which 800,000 hectares are corn and 200,000 hectares are potatoes. Calculated at an increase of 1 ton per hectare, it can increase production by 1 million tons. (4) Expand the multiple cropping area by 300,000 hectares, with an increase of 1 ton per hectare, which can increase production by 300,000 tons. (5) Restore 90,000 hectares of wasteland, with an increase of 1.5 tons per hectare, which can increase production by 135,000 tons. The above measures can increase production by a total of 3.6 million tons. Adding the base of 6.7 million tons in 1957, the total can exceed 10 million tons. The other account is calculated by the unit area yield of various crops: in the 3.6 million hectares of grain crop area, it is estimated that 600,000 hectares of rice will be planted. Calculated at 8,000 catties per hectare, it can produce 2.4 million tons; 1.5 million hectares of corn, calculated at 6,000 catties per hectare (including intercropping and multiple cropping yields), can produce 4.5 million tons; 300,000 hectares of potatoes, calculated at 8,000 catties per hectare (converted to grain), can produce 1.2 million tons; 1.2 million hectares of miscellaneous grains (including sorghum), calculated at 3,000 catties per hectare, can produce 1.8 million tons; plus 700,000 hectares of soybeans, calculated at 2,800 catties per hectare, can produce 980,000 tons. The total can also exceed 10 million tons. In terms of pig production, although the growth rate is even greater, some breeding pigs were retained last winter and this spring, and great achievements have also been made in promoting the use of coarse feed to raise pigs. In the future, as long as the policy of collective raising as the main method is correctly implemented, the promotion of green and coarse feed for pig raising is continued, and the prevention and control work is strengthened, it is still very possible to have 8 million to 10 million pigs in stock by the end of the year. As for vegetable production, as long as the planting area of vegetable fields is expanded by 20,000 hectares, efforts are made to improve the unit area yield, and the purchase and sales work is done well, it is more certain to achieve self-sufficiency. Therefore, while proposing "three self-sufficiencies in one year," we revised the production increase target for 1958 to: grain must reach 10 million tons, pigs must reach 10 million heads, and vegetables must reach 6 million tons.

"Three self-sufficiencies in one year" and "water conservancy in two years, greening in three years, and mechanization and electrification in five years" concentratedly reflect the demands of the broad masses of people. Therefore, when this combat plan was conveyed to the people of the province, it immediately aroused a warm response from the broad masses of cadres and peasants, and became a new and huge driving force for mobilizing millions of people to action. Since last winter, on the basis of the victory of the rural rectification movement, the agricultural production upsurge centered on farmland water conservancy and manure accumulation has since then become more widespread, in-depth, and rapidly developed. In order to seize the time and create the necessary conditions for a great leap forward in agricultural production, local leaders proposed "major work for 50 days" and "hard work for 60 days," and the masses proposed "one target, double the measures." These became the united fighting slogans of leaders and the masses. Many comrades described the characteristics of this movement as: strong momentum, rapid action, high morale, and sufficient energy. The area involved in this movement is very broad. In the countryside, those who participate in labor are "up to ninety-three and down to the Young Pioneers." The labor attendance rate can no longer be calculated based on the registered labor force, but is calculated based on the total population, with some areas as high as 70% or more. In many places, the daytime scene is: "Pigs and dogs guard the door, the Kitchen God is in charge of the house, doors and windows are closed, and it is quiet," and the night scene is: "Lights illuminate the mountains red, and the sound of shovels and picks sparks." Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, urban agency employees, school students, and industrial and commercial circles also volunteered to go to the countryside to contribute their labor and enthusiastically participate in voluntary labor. A lively situation of "leap forward everywhere, leap forward for everyone" has truly formed. Poems full of fighting atmosphere and inspiring people's energy are circulating everywhere in the countryside. 32,000 people in Xinmin County rushed to build the Mahushan Reservoir in the freezing cold. They sang on the construction site in the biting north wind: "The cold weather cannot penetrate our determined hearts, the frozen ground cannot freeze the enthusiasm of the people, the cool water cannot penetrate the revolutionary bones, and the slippery soil cannot knock down the heroes." In just half a month, a reservoir with a storage capacity of 80 million cubic meters was completed. Due to the enthusiasm and soaring energy of the broad masses of people, they not only exerted their labor intensity, but also used their wisdom and created a variety of improved tools. As a result, task targets were repeatedly broken, and production increase measures were increasing day by day. Some areas summarized that "one week is more than what was done in the past month," and some said "fifty days can top one year." In fact, what was done in one winter and spring surpassed the past few thousand years. As of April 20, statistics showed that the newly expanded irrigated area in the province has reached 1.25 million hectares, which is 2.7 times the sum of all irrigated areas in history, and 5.7 times the expanded irrigated area in the first upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction in 1956. The newly added paddy field area is 335,000 hectares, which is 1.4 times the original paddy field area. In terms of increasing the application of manure fertilizer, the fertilizer application area this year can be increased by 20% compared to last year, basically reaching full fertilization; the unit fertilizer application rate is increased by 1.2 times compared to last year, and the total fertilizer application rate is increased by 1.4 times compared to last year. This year's spring plowing and sowing are earlier, faster, more meticulous, and better than in previous years. The sowing period is generally shortened by about half a month, and high-yield crops are widely promoted (judging from the enthusiasm below, the expansion of the planting area of high-yield crops will greatly exceed the estimated number), and the farming system has been more generally reformed. All of this has laid a solid foundation for achieving the task of "three self-sufficiencies in one year." We believe that if we continue this revolutionary energy in the future, the task of "three self-sufficiencies in one year" can definitely be achieved without the occurrence of major disasters.

Ideological Revolution Promotes Production Upsurge
The great leap forward in agricultural production is a production movement, and it is also a great ideological liberation movement. It not only promoted the great development of social productive forces, but also caused profound changes in people's spiritual outlook and social customs. The victory of the all-people rectification and ideological revolution has promoted the high tide of production and construction. The forward development of the production upsurge has further consolidated and developed the achievements of the rectification movement. In the great leap forward in production, the political life in the countryside is unprecedentedly active, and people's ideological state has also undergone extraordinarily rapid changes. After people have achieved invincible and unconquerable results in production actions, they have truly broken free from the shackles of conservative thinking, become more confident in their wisdom and strength, and become more daring to think, speak, and act. For the first time, the broad masses of peasants felt that they had broken away from the position of servants of nature and become the masters of nature. The confidence in conquering nature and marching towards nature has been greatly strengthened. In the process of collective labor, people's collectivist thinking is also growing rapidly. They have been able to correctly combine immediate interests with long-term interests, individual interests with collective interests, and partial interests with overall interests. Under the desire of "suffering for a few years first, and enjoying happiness for ten thousand years later," they not only "treat the dark sky as daytime, the moon as the sun, and one day as two days," and muster the greatest energy in labor, but also many people consciously and voluntarily take out their financial resources and material resources to support production and construction. The elderly took out the coffin money they had accumulated for many years, young women took out the money to buy clothes and wedding money, and children took out the New Year's money; in the past, they competed to buy the four major items (watches, bicycles, sewing machines, radios), but now they save money and actively invest in construction. In the comparison and competition spontaneously launched by the leadership organization and the masses, it not only showed a spirit of comparing the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and striving for the upstream, and revolutionary heroism, but also fully demonstrated the socialist spirit of mutual aid and love. Many advanced areas and units actively and voluntarily used manpower, material resources, and technology to support backward units in order to achieve "common leap forward." In order to support large-scale water conservancy projects, many areas organized labor support throughout the county. The people who went to work took their own firewood and grain, and did not count work points. Not only did they have no complaints, but they were also enthusiastic. "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me," and "Socialist affairs are handled by everyone" have become the common belief of the broad masses of people and are considered to be the noble virtues of socialism. In the great leap forward in production, many customs-changing deeds also occurred. In many areas, when large-scale water conservancy projects were being built and preparations were being made for mechanization, the masses spontaneously moved their graves or practiced deep burial, which reduced cultivation obstacles and expanded the cultivated land area. The changes in the thinking of the broad masses of peasants can be described by Marx's saying that "one day is equal to twenty years" without exaggeration.

Cadres' Actions Inspired the Masses
In the great leap forward in agricultural production, leaders at all levels have also gained tremendous gains in transforming their work style and improving their leadership methods. In addition to generally adopting the practices of secretaries taking the lead, dividing battle lines and war zones, dividing areas for contracting, establishing responsibility systems, and widely using large-scale publicity to mobilize the whole people, leaders and the masses directly meeting, and inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to maintain the rapid and full development of the movement, the more important thing is to more thoroughly transform the leadership style. First of all, leaders at all levels have generally adopted the practice of "putting politics in command, centering on production, and driving all tasks forward together." The forms of large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, large-character posters used in the rectification movement continue to be powerful weapons for solving ideological problems and inspiring combat will in production. In addition, forms such as visits, on-site observations, comparison and competition are used as supplements. "If you don't understand, debate; if you don't believe, look; if you don't know, learn; if you learn, use." This effectively promoted the forward development of the upsurge. Due to the strengthening of political and ideological work, the centrifugal tendencies of many departments' work have also been effectively overcome, truly achieving "twisting into one rope" with production as the center, and promoting socialist cooperation among various departments. Secondly, leading cadres at all levels can often go deep into the grassroots, go to the front line of combat, closely contact the masses, contact production reality, and eat, live, and work with the masses. Many county-level agencies moved to the countryside to work, implementing "offices are located in the countryside, and meetings are held in the countryside," making work more closely integrated with production reality. The democratic style of cadres has been greatly strengthened, and the working method of the mass line has become more conscious. Bureaucracy and stagnation have been greatly reduced, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. The masses generally reflected: "The cadres' work style has greatly changed, they take the lead in labor and production, the leadership work is more specific, and our energy has also broken through the sky." Throughout the movement, it was precisely the actions of the cadres that inspired the masses, and the energy of the masses profoundly educated the cadres. Such mutual promotion has continuously improved the awareness of cadres and the masses, and unity has also been strengthened day by day. This political situation of a happy mood and liveliness has become an infinite force for promoting the rapid development of productive forces. This is also the main reason why we have unparalleled confidence in achieving the production increase plan and the arduous task of "three self-sufficiencies in one year."

Of course, the development of the movement is still not balanced, and there are still many difficulties on our road forward. Various natural disasters are still threatening us. If we are satisfied with the achievements we have made and stop moving forward, we will make various mistakes. Therefore, we must also guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to go all out on the basis of the achievements we have made, continue to boost our morale, overcome shortcomings, and overcome difficulties. Our fighting goals can be fully realized.

    农业生产要与工业生产相适应
    辽宁省副省长　褚凤岐
    发展农业　保证供应
    辽宁“一年实现粮食、猪肉、蔬菜三自给”的任务，是今年3月初省委召开全省农村工作会议上提出和确定下来的。这是中央关于鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针在我省农业战线上的具体体现，同时也是反复不断地和右倾保守思想作斗争，在思想解放的基础上；大胆提出来的战斗目标。
    我们辽宁省几年来在中央的正确领导下，在发展农业生产上是有很大成绩的。但是和我省工业生产发展、城市人口增长速度来比较，则是很不相适应的。我省1952年的城市人口是四百零三万人，1957年增加到八百四十万人，五年来增长了一倍以上。而在农业生产方面，粮食产量1957年比1952年仅增长21％；生猪头数仅增长15％；蔬菜播种面积五年来增加86％。农业生产很显然是落后了。这样就使得原来就供不应求的局面更加紧张，逆差越来越扩大。近年来，每年都需要国家供应一百二十万吨左右的粮食，和从兄弟省份调进二万吨左右猪肉和八万吨左右蔬菜，才能勉强过活。这样做，不仅给国家增加很多负担和造成很大损失，而且也影响对消费者的正常供应，影响工农联盟的巩固，影响工业的高速度地发展，并使我们许多工作常常处于被动状态。我们算了这样几笔账：国家每年从外地向我省调进的粮食、猪肉、蔬菜，共需要占用五万多个火车皮；国家经营这些物资，每年要亏损二千万元以上；如果将国家供给我省的一百二十万吨粮食和二万吨猪肉用来出口，可以换回一百多万吨钢材。由于大量的粮食是从外地调入的，我省人民在食粮品种上就常常因外省的丰歉而转移，吉林、黑龙江丰收了，就要多吃些杂粮；华北各省丰收了，就要多吃些白面；南方各省丰收了，就要多吃些籼米。消费者对食粮品种常常没有选择的余地，是有很大意见的。所以不论是从减轻国家负担，支援工业高速度地发展，或是从改善人民生活着想，争取尽快地做到“三自给”，就成为我省农业生产战线上的极端迫切的现实任务。
    “三自给”的奋斗目标是比较早的就提出来了，但是采取什么样的速度来实现这个目标，则有一个思想斗争发展的过程。我们在不久以前还设想要花三年甚至五年的时间来实现这个目标，那时我们还是被各种各样的右倾保守思想束缚着。过去我们只是看到本省工业比重大，城市人口多，主食和副食品需要量增加的快，农业生产则受自然条件影响，增长的不快和不够稳定，而低估了农业增产的潜力，低估了合作化后解放了的农民的积极性和创造力量；过去我们只是消极地看到领导力量集中搞工业，对农业照顾不够的一面，而没有重视运用工业力量支援农业对发展农业生产非常有利的一面；此外，还有由于对过去工作缺乏正确估价因而存在怕“冒进”的思想，在自然条件较差的地区存在“唯条件论”的思想，在条件或基础较好的地区有安于现状的自满情绪等等。正因为存在着这样一些思想障碍，所以去年冬季我省农业生产高潮的规模、速度，是远远落后在许多兄弟省份的后面。在本年3月初召开的全省农村工作会议上，我们本着中央批判“反冒进”和鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，并同整风运动后发动起来的群众的积极性相结合，彻底检查批判了各级领导的保守思想。“一年三自给”的任务是在这样进一步克服了右倾，解放了思想，鼓起了干劲，增强了信心的情况下提出和通过的。与此同时，还根据我省具体情况，提出了“二年水利化，三年绿化，五年实现机械化、电气化”做为“苦战三年，基本改变生产面貌”在我省的具体奋斗目标。因此，可以说“一年三自给”是整风“双反”运动胜利的成果，是思想大解放的产物。
  任务虽艰巨　实现有根据
    在我省一年实现“三自给”的任务是很艰巨的，但是经过努力做好工作，实现这个目标还是有充分根据的。首先，做到“三自给”在生产上所需要达到的数量是：粮食九百万吨，生猪八百万头，蔬菜六百万吨。这些数量比1957年实际完成数分别增长：粮食为34.3％，生猪为70％，蔬菜为28％。能否实现这样大幅度的增产呢？在粮食方面我们算了两笔账：一笔是增产措施账，我们实现增产的主要措施是：（1）大搞农田水利。今年计划扩大灌溉面积一百九十万垧（一垧合十五市亩），其中新开水田三十六万垧，按每垧增产一吨半计算，可增产五十四万吨；水浇地扩大一百五十四万垧，受益显著的以五十万垧计算，每垧增产半吨，可增产二十五万吨，两项合计增产七十九万吨。（2）增施粪肥。今年计划扩大施肥面积一百二十万垧，每垧增产零点四吨，可增产四十八万吨；单位施肥量比去年增加半倍，每垧增产○点三吨，可增产九十万吨，两项合计为一百三十八万吨。（3）扩大高产作物面积一百万垧，其中苞米八十万垧，薯类二十万垧，按每垧增产一吨计算，可增产一百万吨。（4）扩大复种面积三十万垧，每垧增产一吨，可增产三十万吨。（5）恢复撩荒地九万垧，每垧增产一吨半，可增产十三万五千吨。综合上述措施共可增产三百六十万吨，加上1957年的基数六百七十万吨，则总数可以超过一千万吨。另一笔账以各种作物品单位面积产量计算：在三百六十万垧粮谷作物面积中，预计播种水稻六十万垧，以垧产八千斤计算可产二百四十万吨；苞米一百五十万垧，以垧产六千斤计算（包括套种复种产量在内），可产四百五十万吨；薯类三十万垧，以垧产八千斤计算（折粮），可产一百二十万吨；杂粮一百二十万垧（高粮在内），以垧产三千斤计，共产一百八十万吨；外加七十万垧大豆，以垧产二千八百斤计算，共产九十八万吨，总数也可以超过一千万吨。在生猪生产上，虽然增长幅度更大些，但由于去冬今春多留了一些种猪，在推广粗饲料养猪上也取得很大成绩，今后只要正确地贯彻以集体饲养为主的方针，继续推行青、粗饲料养猪，加强防疫工作等，则年底圈存猪数达到八百万到一千万头还是有很大可能的。至于蔬菜生产，只要在播种面积上扩大菜田二万垧，努力提高单位面积产量，再加上做好购销工作，做到自给是更比较有把握的。因此，我们在提出“一年三自给”的同时，把1958年的增产指标修订为：粮食要达到一千万吨，生猪达到一千万头，蔬菜达到六百万吨。
    “一年三自给”和“二年水利化，三年绿化，五年实现机械化、电气化”，这是集中的反映了广大人民群众的要求，所以当这个战斗规划向全省人民传达后，立即引起了广大干部和农民群众的热烈响应，成为发动千百万群众行动的新的巨大的动力。去冬以来，在农村整风运动胜利基础上，所形成的以兴修农田水利和积肥为中心的农业生产高潮，自此以后就更加普遍、深入，迅猛异常地开展起来。为了争取时间，创造农业生产大跃进必要的条件，各地领导提出了“大干五十天”，“苦干六十天”，群众提出了“一份指标，双倍措施”，这些成为领导与群众上下一致的奋战口号。许多同志形容这个运动的特点是：来势猛，行动快，情绪高，劲头足。这次运动所牵动的面非常广泛，农村里参加劳动的是“上至九十三，下至红领巾”。劳动出勤率已不能按登记的劳动力来计算，而是按总人口来计算了，有的地区高达70％以上。许多地方出现了白天是：“猪狗看门，灶王爷当家，关门闭户，鸦雀无声”，夜晚是：“灯火照的满山红，锹镐响的冒火星”。解放军指战员、城镇的机关职工、学校学生、工商业界也纷纷自动到农村献工，热情地参加了义务劳动。真正形成了一个“处处跃进，人人跃进”的生动局面。农村到处传诵着富有战斗气氛、鼓舞人们干劲的诗歌，新民县三万二千人乘冻突击修建马虎山水库，他们在北风凛冽的工地上歌唱着：“天冷冷不透坚决的心，地冻冻不了热心的人，水凉凉不透革命的骨，土滑滑不倒英雄汉”，前后只用半个月，一座蓄水八千万方的水库即告建成。由于广大群众的热情奔放、干劲冲天，不仅发挥了劳动强度，而且运用了智慧，创造了多种多样的改良工具，因而任务指标屡被突破，增产措施日有增加。有的地区总结说“一个星期比过去一个月做的事要多”，有的讲“五十天可以顶上一年”，实际上是一个冬春所干的事，胜过了过去的几千年。截至4月20日统计，全省新扩大的灌溉面积已达一百二十五万垧，为有史以来全部灌溉面积总和的二点七倍，等于1956年第一次农田水利建设高潮扩大灌溉面积的五点七倍。新增加水田面积三十三万五千垧，为原有水田面积的一点四倍。在增施粪肥方面，今年的施肥面积较比去年可提高20％，基本达到满粪化；单位施肥量较去年增加一点二倍，总的施肥量比去年增长一点四倍。今年的春耕播种较历年都早、快、细、好，播种期一般的缩短约半个月，并且大量地推广了高产作物（从下边的劲头看，扩大高产作物面积会大大超过预计数），较普遍地改革了耕作制度。所有这一切，已为实现“一年三自给”任务，打下了坚实的基础。我们相信，今后如果持续这种革命的干劲，在没有特大灾情降临的情况下，“一年三自给”的任务，是肯定可以实现的。
    思想革命促成生产高潮
    农业生产大跃进，是个生产运动，同时也是思想大解放运动。它不仅促进了社会生产力的大发展，而且也引起人们精神面貌和社会风尚的深刻变化。全民整风，思想革命的胜利，促成了生产建设高潮形势，生产高潮的向前发展，又更加巩固和发展了整风运动的成果。在生产大跃进中，农村中的政治生活空前活跃，人们的思想状态也发生异常迅速的变化。当人们在生产行动中，取得了战无不胜，攻无不克的战果以后，已真正地摆脱了保守思想的羁绊，更加相信了自己的智慧和力量，变得越来越敢想、敢说、敢做。广大农民第一次感到自己已脱离开自然界奴仆的地位，变成了自然界的主宰。征服自然，向大自然进军的信心大大加强了。在集体劳动的过程中，人们的集体主义思想也迅速地成长着。他们已经能够把眼前利益和长远利益、个人利益和集体利益、局部利益和整体利益正确地结合起来。在“先吃几年苦，后享万年福”的愿望下，他们不仅“黑天当白天，月亮当太阳，一天顶两天”，在劳动中鼓起最大的干劲，而且许多人自觉自愿地拿出自己的财力、物力来支援生产建设。老年人拿出了多年积蓄的棺材本钱，青年妇女拿出了买衣服钱和结婚用钱，儿童拿出来押岁钱；过去是争相购买四大件（手表、自行车、缝纫机、收音机），现在则是省吃俭用踊跃投资搞建设。在领导组织和群众自发的展开评比竞赛当中，不仅表现了一种比先进、赶先进、力争上游的精神和革命的英雄气概，而且还充分发挥了友爱互助的社会主义协作精神。许多先进地区和单位，主动的、自愿的以人力、物力、技术来支援后进的单位，以达到“共同跃进”。为了支援大型水利工程，许多地区是在全县范围组织劳力支援，出工的人是自己拿柴带粮，不计工酬，不但毫无怨言，而且热情高涨。“我为人人，人人为我”，“社会主义的事大家办”，成了广大群众的共同信念，被认为是社会主义高尚的美德。在生产大跃进中，也发生了许多移风易俗的事迹。许多地区在大修水利工程和准备实现机械化的情况下，群众已自发地迁移了坟墓或实行了深葬，既减少了耕作障碍，又扩大了耕地面积。广大农民群众思想情况的变化，用马克思所讲的“一天等于二十年”来形容它，是并不过分的。
  干部的行动鼓舞了群众
    在农业生产大跃进中，各级领导在转变作风和改进领导方法方面的收获也是巨大的。除了一般地都采取了书记挂帅，划分战线、战区，分片包干，建立责任制；广泛运用了大张旗鼓全民动员，领导和群众直接见面，鼓舞群众的革命热情，以保持运动的迅速饱满发展外，更主要的则是比较彻底地转变了领导作风。首先是各级领导普遍采取了“政治挂帅，生产中心，带动各项工作一道前进”的做法。在整风中所采用的大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的形式，在生产中继续成为解决思想问题，鼓舞战斗意志的有力武器。此外还辅之以参观访问，现场观摩，评比竞赛等形式。“不通就辩，不信就看，不会就学，学了就用”，从而有力地推动了高潮的向前发展。由于政治思想工作的加强，还有效地克服了许多部门工作的分散主义偏向，真正做到了以生产为中心“拧成一股子绳”，推动了各部门之间的社会主义大协作。其次，各级领导干部都能经常深入基层，亲临作战的第一线，密切联系群众，接触生产实际，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。许多县级机关搬到了乡下办公，实行“公在乡下办，会在乡下开”，使工作更加结合生产实际。干部民主作风大为加强，群众路线工作方法更加自觉。官气、暮气大大减少，因而干群关系大为改善。群众普遍反映：“干部作风大转变，劳动生产带头干，领导工作更具体，我们的干劲也冲破了天”。在整个运动中，就是这样的以干部的行动鼓舞了群众，群众的干劲又深刻地教育了干部，如此相互促进，使干部、群众觉悟不断提高，团结也日益加强。这种心情舒畅，生动活泼的政治局面，就成为推动生产力迅速发展的无穷的力量。我们对实现增产计划，实现“一年三自给”的艰巨任务有无比信心，主要原因也正在于此。
    当然，目前运动的发展还是不够平衡的，在我们前进的道路上，还是有许多困难的，各种自然灾害还在威胁着我们，如果我们满足于已得成就，因而裹足不前，还会犯各种各样的错误。因此，我们还必须戒骄戒躁，在已取得成绩的基础上，再接再厉，继续鼓足干劲，克服缺点，战胜困难，我们的奋斗目标是完全可以实现的。
