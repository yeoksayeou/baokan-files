    Rabbit Nanny
    By Fu Dong, Our Reporter
    I went to visit the Anhui Province Finance and Trade System's Exhibition of Production Achievements of Transferred Cadres.

    A staff member named Yu Youyi explained things to me. He led me to a long row of rabbit cages and said, "The rabbits in here were all raised by me."

    The first two cages contained two white, fluffy rabbits about a foot long. These rabbits looked really strange; their fur was four or five inches long. From a distance, they looked like large balls of cotton. It was the first time I'd seen such unique rabbits. Yu Youyi said, "These are Angora rabbits, a foreign breed."

    The rabbit next to them was coffee-colored, with short fur, but it was shiny like a piece of satin. This rabbit was biting the cage with all its might. Yu Youyi said, "This kind of rabbit is called Rex, also a foreign breed. Its fur is like otter fur. This rabbit is usually very well-behaved and rarely loses its temper, but after coming to Beijing, the environment is unfamiliar, and it doesn't have anything hard to eat, so its teeth are itchy, that's why it's biting the cage."

    We walked to a dark blue Rex rabbit. Yu Youyi reached in to touch it, but as soon as he touched it, the rabbit jumped and hopped inside. He said, "This rabbit is hungry, looking for its mother!" He moved the basin of bean dregs closer to the rabbit and continued, "Look, the rabbit has wrinkles on its body, that tells you it's not full yet!" He told me that this rabbit was only a few days old when it was bought back from Zhejiang, and he fed it drop by drop with soy milk using a dropper. Feeding it really took effort, feeding it once every hour, and watching it grow up little by little.

    The rabbit in the last cage looked very distinctive, with a snow-white body, but its limbs and ears were pitch black. The sign said "Himalayan Rabbit," a rabbit from the Himalayas in our country. The rabbit was lying quietly, resting. Yu Youyi said, "This rabbit's belly is red and shiny, which means it's full and resting!"

    We went around in a circle and returned to the Angora rabbits. Yu Youyi suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "This rabbit doesn't look right. In just a little while, its expression has changed. Look closely, the rabbit's eyes are glazed over, and it looks listless." He opened the door, reached in to touch the rabbit's ears, and turned them over to look. He said, "The rabbit is sick, its ears are burning hot, and its veins are also turning purple. It needs to get out and move around, bask in the sun, and eat some green grass." As he spoke, he let the rabbit out.

    "At home, I have forty adult rabbits and two hundred and seventy baby rabbits. I really miss them when I'm away. In the past few days, I've been dreaming about my little rabbits almost every day. I've written several letters! I don't know why, but no letter has come back. My little guys are so much fun! After being with them for a long time, I know each one's temper well! Which one eats a lot, which one eats a little, which one has a bad temper, which one gives birth to more babies, which one is a good breed, I can tell you each one. I can even point out each rabbit's father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, great-grandfather, and great-grandmother.

    "When I left, one rabbit had just given birth to nine baby rabbits, but it didn't have enough milk to feed them. I fed them every day with a dropper. I wonder how they are now?"

    This young man looked no more than twenty-four or five years old, but I never expected him to be an expert on rabbits!

    "How many years have you been raising rabbits?" I asked.

    "Only one year."

    As we spoke, we walked to a chart with eight or nine photos on it. He pointed to the people in the photos and said, "Look, this group of people is smiling as they wash the rabbits' utensils, mix their food, and check their physiques… These are photos of our work. A year ago, if you had come to see us, we wouldn't have been like this…"

    He talked about the past.

    He used to work at the People's Bank of Anhui Province. Last March, his superiors notified him to go down to the Wushanling Farm to raise rabbits. When he heard this news, he really couldn't understand it. He was happy to be transferred; a young man should get some training. But training should be either farming or working in a factory! What's the point of raising rabbits? Raising rabbits is a light job for old ladies, old men, and children. It's really pointless for a young man in his twenties to do this!

    His superiors sent him to a training class at the Huzhou Livestock Company in Zhejiang Province to study.

    The first time he entered the rabbit house, he felt nauseous and wanted to vomit. He couldn't describe the smell; it gave him a headache. The rabbits looked white and clean, like snow, but in reality, they were filthy from pooping and peeing all the time. He kindly reached out to touch a rabbit, but unexpectedly, the rabbit bit him, drawing blood. People say that dogs understand human nature. If you feed them and give them water, they'll get to know you and wag their tails when they see you. You're not raising them for nothing. But no matter how good you are to rabbits, they bite you at the slightest provocation. Rabbits have such big tempers. If you're even a little late to give them food, they'll roar like thunder in their cages. If you walk up to them, they'll deliberately pee all over your face, which is infuriating!

    This was already annoying enough, but who knew that these rabbits were so delicate. If they didn't eat enough, they'd make a fuss. If they ate too much, they'd get diarrhea. If you didn't take good care of them, they'd die in a few days. If a rabbit was pregnant, you had to touch it gently. One wrong move, and you'd either kill the babies or cause the mother rabbit to miscarry. They were as fragile as paper!

    Others jokingly called them "Rabbit Nannies," and he would blush when he heard it. He thought, "Anything is better than raising rabbits! You can master a set of skills in farming, forestry, or beekeeping, but what can you master in raising rabbits!"

    At this time, he received a letter from home. His older brother, who worked on the railway, had been crushed to death by a train. His thoughts were even more turbulent. His brother was dead, so his family must be going hungry. The more he thought about it, the more upset he became, so he wrote a letter to his superiors requesting to be transferred back to his hometown to work.

    One day, a teacher named Lu Zhemin came to give a lecture to everyone. He said, "Don't underestimate raising rabbits. Although rabbits are small, nothing about them is waste. Their fur can be used to make fur coats, fur hats, and fur gloves. Their wool can be used to knit sweaters and make woolen serge. Their meat can be eaten. Their blood can be used to make serums. Their bones can be used to make bone meal. Rabbit manure is the best fertilizer." Lu Zhemin said, "The Soviet Union needs fifty to one hundred tons of our rabbit wool every year! The export of rabbit wool alone can bring back a lot of steel and tractors!"

    Lu Zhemin talked about the economic value, prospects, and history of raising rabbits, as well as the techniques. He said, "Raising rabbits requires knowledge, and it's very interesting to delve into."

    These words moved Yu Youyi a little, but he wasn't completely convinced. When he returned to the farm, he kept asking to be transferred back to his hometown.

    His superiors tried to persuade him in every way, but he wouldn't listen. Finally, his superiors approved his request to go home for two weeks.

    When he got home, everything was different from what he had imagined. The railway sent more than forty yuan to his family every month, and the fellow workers sent coal to his family on time every month. When his sister-in-law was in confinement, the workers came to see her and brought a lot of noodles, brown sugar, and eggs. They couldn't finish eating the hundreds of eggs. His sister-in-law said, "The workers treat us like family and take care of us better than anyone else. Don't worry about home. Work hard at the farm."

    Yu Youyi didn't sleep all night. He thought of his brother's death. It wasn't his brother's shift on the night he died. But another comrade was sick, and his brother volunteered to take his place. In fact, he himself had a high fever, and he was delirious, but he didn't say anything, and as a result, he was crushed to death by a train.

    His brother was so selfless, so why was he always turning around in his own little circle? He thought of the worker named Sha Fasheng at the livestock company training class. That worker never seemed to know what fatigue was. He was busy all day long, but he wasn't busy with his own affairs! He was busy boiling water, sweeping the house, cutting grass, and carrying water for the rabbits. He was busy feeding the rabbits and washing their utensils. He carried more than a dozen loads of water for the rabbits every day! Who was Sha Fasheng busy for?

    He also thought of the villagers who lived near the farm. They also went to the fields before sunrise and came back after sunset. Who were they doing it for?

    He thought of what Farm Director Ma Yunzhang had told him: "Why did the female nurse in the movie 'Shangganling' risk her life to carry the wounded to the trenches? Why were Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang willing to risk their lives to fight the enemy?"

    He understood. The next day, without saying a word, he packed his bedding and returned to the farm.

    He only stayed home for six days out of his two-week leave.

    After Yu Youyi came back, he seemed like a different person. Strangely enough, he didn't find the rabbit house smelly anymore. He didn't feel tired when he was working. He washed the rabbits' utensils, built cages for the rabbits, and mixed their feed. He didn't sleep at noon, but went to the fields in the hot sun to find tender weeds for the rabbits.

    When rabbits give birth to baby rabbits, they pull out a lot of fur from their bodies to pad the nest. This is a big waste! A pound of fur costs several yuan. Could they use old cotton instead? They tried it, and it worked very well. This saved the country a lot of money!

    They explored and discovered that rabbits eat certain things that make it easier for them to give birth to baby rabbits. They used "double mating" and "triple mating" methods to make the rabbits give birth to more and more babies. Before, giving birth to five or six babies per litter was good, but now giving birth to seven has become common! The most they can give birth to is twelve in one litter. They also used hybridization methods to breed many beautiful, strong, and never-before-seen baby rabbits.

    Yu Youyi said, "There's so much to learn about raising rabbits. The more you study it, the more you realize how much there is to it. We are now trying to get the rabbits to give birth to baby rabbits once a month and have them give birth to a dozen at a time each time. We used to shear the rabbit wool once a season, but now we are trying to get the rabbits to grow more wool so that we can shear them once a month."

    This young man became more and more enthusiastic as he spoke. He said, "I have already planned for myself. I plan to be a rabbit nanny for the rest of my life!" (Attached photo)

    兔子保姆
    本报记者　傅冬
    我去安徽省财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会去参观。
    一位名叫于游艺的工作人员给我讲解。他带我走到一长排兔笼子跟前，说：“这里面的兔子都是我一手养大的。”
    头两个笼里关着两只一尺来长的白茸茸的兔子。这兔子长得真怪，毛有四、五寸长，远远看去，活像一大团棉花。我头一次见这么特别的兔子。于游艺说：“这是安哥拉兔，外国种。”
    旁边一只兔子是咖啡色，毛短短的，但亮光光的像块缎子。这兔子正用力咬笼子。于游艺说：“这种兔子名叫力克斯，也是外国种，它的皮毛活像水獭皮。这兔子性情本来挺好，常不发脾气，来了北京，环境生，加上没硬东西吃，牙发痒，才咬笼子。”
    我们走到一只靛蓝色的力克斯兔子面前，于游艺伸进手指去摸它，那知一碰，兔子在里面乱蹦乱跳。他说：“这兔子饿了，找母亲呢！”他把盛豆渣的盆盆往兔子跟前挪了挪，接着说：“你瞧，兔身上有了绉纹，这就是告诉人说它还没吃饱呢！”他告诉我，这兔子从浙江买回来时才生下没几天，是他拿滴管一滴一滴用豆浆把它喂大的。喂它可真花了功夫，一点钟喂一次，真是一点一点看它长大起来。
    最后一个笼子里的兔子长得很别致，身子雪白，可四肢、耳朵却黑漆漆的，牌子上写着：“喜马拉雅山兔”，是我国喜马拉雅山上的兔子。兔子正静静地躺着休息。于游艺说：“这兔子的肚子又红又光，这就是说它吃饱了，休息呢！”
    我们绕了一圈，又走回安哥拉兔子跟前，于游艺忽然吃惊地说：“这兔子神气不对了，才这么一会功夫，它神气就变了，你仔细瞧，兔子的眼睛发呆，没精打彩的。”他打开门伸进手去摸兔子的耳朵并翻过来看了看，他说：“兔子是病了，耳朵滚烫，筋也发紫，得出来活动活动，晒晒太阳，吃点青草。”说着他把兔子放了出来。
    “家里，我还有四十只大兔子，二百七十只小兔子。出来怪想的慌，前些天几乎天天都梦见我的小兔子，我写了几封信去啦！不知怎的，一直没信来，别提我的那些小家伙多好玩啦！和它们处久了，一个个的脾气我都摸透啦！哪一个吃的多，哪一个吃的少，那个脾气坏，那个生的娃娃多，那个品种好，我都能一个个说上来。连每个兔子的父亲、母亲、祖父、祖母、外祖父、外祖母我都能指出来。
    “我来时，有一只兔子一窝生了九个小兔子，可奶不够吃，我天天用滴管喂，现在不知怎样了？”
    这个年青人看上去也不过二十四、五岁的样子，想不到是个兔子行家呢！
    “你养了几年兔子了？”我问。
    “才一年。”
    说着，我们走到一个图表前，图表上贴着八、九张照片。他指照片里的人说：“你看这一群人正笑眯眯地给兔子洗食具、调食料、检查体格……这是我们工作的照片，一年前，你要是来看，我们可不是这样子……”
    他谈起了过去。
    他本来在安徽省人民银行做事。去年3月，领导上通知他，叫他下放到巫山岭农场养兔子。当他听到这个消息时，思想上实在搞不通。下放，他很高兴，一个年青人应该锻炼锻炼，但是，锻炼，要么去种地，要么去工厂干活！养兔子干什么？养兔子这轻活，是老太太、老爷子和小孩子的事，一个二十多岁的年青小伙子干这真没出息！
    领导上派他去浙江湖州牲畜公司一个训练班去学习。
    头一次进兔房，他噁心得想吐，说不出是股什么味儿，熏得人头痛。兔子看起来白白的，像雪一样干净，实际上一会拉屎一会撒尿脏得一蹋糊涂。他好心好意地伸手去摸兔子，却不料兔子反咬了他一口，咬得鲜血直流。人家说，狗通人性，你给它吃，你给它喝，熟了，它见了你，摇头摆尾，你养它不白养。可兔子你对它再好，它动不动就咬你。兔子的脾气真大，你稍稍晚一点给它送饭，它就在笼里咆哮如雷。你走到跟前，它故意撒你一嘴一脸的尿，真气死人！
    这已经够让人生气了，谁知道这兔子还娇得不得了，吃不饱，它闹，吃多了，它又拉稀，照顾不好，几天就呜呼哀哉。兔子怀了娃娃，你轻轻去摸，一个不小心，不是把娃娃?死了，就是弄得大兔子小产了。真是娇得像张纸！
    别人开玩笑，见面喊他们“兔子保姆”，他一听，脸就发烧。他想：“干什么都比养兔子好！种地、造林、养蜂都能钻出一套技术，可养兔子能钻出什么名堂！”
    正在这时候，他接到一封家信。在铁路上作工的哥哥叫火车压死了。他思想上波动得更厉害了。哥哥死了，家里的人一定饿肚子了，他越想越心烦，便给领导写了封信，请求调回家乡工作。
    有一天，一个名叫陆哲民的老师来给大伙上课。他说，别小看养兔子，兔子虽小，可一身没废物，它的皮可以做皮大衣、皮帽子、皮手套，它的毛可织毛衣，作呢绒哔叽，它的肉可吃，它的血可制血清，它的骨头可以做骨粉，兔粪是最好的肥料。陆哲民说，苏联一年就要我们五十吨到一百吨的兔毛，光兔毛出口可换回不少钢材和拖拉机！
    陆哲民从养兔的经济价值、前途、历史，谈到养兔的技术。他说：“养兔要有文化，钻进去很有意思。”
    这一番话，说得于游艺心动了一动，但他思想还没全通。回到农场他还是一个劲儿地要求调回家乡。
    领导上左说右说，他听不进去。最后领导上批准他回家两个星期。
    到家一看，一切和想的都不一样。铁路上月月给家里送四十多块钱，工人同志们月月按时给家里送煤。嫂子坐月子，工人们你来看，我来瞧，还送来一大堆挂面、红糖、鸡蛋，几百个鸡蛋吃都吃不完。嫂子说：“工人兄弟把咱当自家人，照护得再好没有了，你别惦记家，好好在农场工作。”
    于游艺一夜没睡觉。他想到哥哥的死。死的那晚，并不该哥哥值班。但别的同志病了，哥哥主动提出来去替班，实际上他自己也正在发高烧，烧得迷迷糊糊，但他不吭声，结果叫车压死了。
    哥哥这样舍己为人，为什么自己老在个人的圈子里打转转？他想起牲畜公司训练班那个叫沙发生的工人，那个工人好像从不知道疲倦是什么，他一天到晚在忙，但他忙的不是个人的事！他忙着给大伙烧水、扫屋子，忙着给兔子割草、挑水，忙着给兔子喂吃的、洗食具。他一天光给兔子挑水就挑十几担！沙发生这样忙，为的是谁？
    他又想起住在农场跟前的那些老乡，他们也是顶着星星上地，披着星星回来，他们为的是谁？
    他想起了马云章场长给他讲的话：“‘上甘岭’影片里那位女护士为什么要冒着生命危险到战壕里去背伤员？董存瑞和黄继光为什么愿意用生命去和敌人拼？”
    他想通了，第二天，二话没说，背着铺盖回农场了。
    两个星期的假，他住了六天就回来了。
    于游艺回来以后，就像变了个人，说也怪，现在进兔房也不觉臭了。干起活来，也不觉累了。他给兔子洗食具，给兔子造笼子，给兔子配食料。中午他不睡觉，顶着火红的太阳到野外去给兔子找嫩野草。
    兔子生小兔子，把身上的毛拉下一大堆，垫在窝里。这是个大浪费！一斤毛要好几块钱，能不能用旧棉花代？他们试了一下，很好，这一下，又给国家省了不少钱！
    他们摸索摸索，发现兔子吃几样东西特别容易生小兔子，他们用“双交配”“三交配”的法儿，使小兔子越生越多，以前一胎生五、六只就不错了，现在一下子生七只变成了常事！最多一胎能生十二只。他们还用杂交的法儿生出许多又漂亮、又结实、从没见过的小兔子。
    于游艺说：“养兔子的学问真大，越研究越觉这里面的玩意多，我们现在正在想法叫兔子一个月生一回小兔子，每次都叫它生十几只，原先我们一季剪一次兔毛，现在我们想法叫兔子多长毛，以后一个月剪一次。”
    这位年青人越说越起劲，他说：“我已给自己安排好了，我打算一辈子当兔子保姆！”（附图片）
