Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on the 28th, specifically examining and studying the development speed of Jiangxi's local industry in accordance with the spirit of the General Line.

The meeting held that the completion of this year's industrial production and capital construction plans was better than in any previous year, but according to the requirements of this year's Great Leap Forward plan, the current speed was still unsatisfactory. Especially in capital construction, some things that could be done quickly were not, some things that could be done faster were not, and some things that could be done more were not. The reason for this was that the mind was not completely liberated, the understanding and implementation of the General Line was insufficient, the principle of simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises was not adhered to, and there were problems of emphasizing large over small, emphasizing mechanization over indigenous methods, and waiting for mechanization. In response to this situation, the meeting decided to immediately launch a new high tide of accelerating industrial construction in the province. In terms of production, it was required to resolutely complete more than 45% of the annual Great Leap Forward plan in the first half of the year. Capital construction projects that met the conditions should be started quickly, and those already started should work harder to accelerate construction. Conditions that were not yet met should be created in every possible way to strive for early completion of preparatory work. In short, whether production or construction, time should be seized to strengthen leadership, strengthen collaboration, and accelerate speed.

The meeting studied measures to accelerate the speed of industrial construction, believing that the first step was to vigorously publicize the General Line and resolutely implement it. Through large-scale publicity, the General Line should be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and become a driving force for promoting a new high tide of industrial production and realizing the Great Leap Forward plan. The meeting held that resolutely implementing the principle of simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises was an important aspect of accelerating industrial construction at present. To this end, the meeting decided that while building large and medium-sized steel plants, oil refineries, and fertilizer plants, it was necessary to actively build small factories and mines. For example, for small iron smelting plants, the meeting decided to build 189 in the province this year, with an annual output of more than 220,000 tons, and to build 89 small oil refineries, with an annual output of 55,000 tons. These small factories and mines require little investment and simple equipment, which can be solved within the province, so they can be quickly built and put into production. Grasping the construction of nine key projects in light of the province's conditions in the overall leap forward and comprehensive development is another measure taken by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee to accelerate the speed of industrial construction. The meeting decided to concentrate efforts this year on developing the production of agricultural machinery, power, fuel, and steel raw materials in order to support the agricultural Great Leap Forward and ensure future industrial development. To this end, the meeting adjusted the use of industrial funds and the allocation of equipment this year. In order to accelerate the speed of industrial construction, the meeting decided to establish and improve the industrial leadership organizations of Party committees at all levels, and to transfer cadres to strengthen the industrial front. In addition, the meeting preliminarily reviewed and revised some unreasonable rules and regulations that affected the speed of construction.

Accelerating the speed of industrial development is an issue that the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has been paying attention to and studying recently. A few days ago, the Provincial Party Committee held a provincial telephone conference, calling on Party committees at all levels and the people of the province to accelerate the speed of industrial construction. Subsequently, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting attended by 40 counties on the development of small factories and mines. At this meeting, the principle of focusing on small-scale local industry was further discussed, and a plan for vigorously developing small factories and mines was made.

    具备条件的要赶快上马　已经上马的要快马加鞭
    江西掀起加快建设速度新高潮
    省委研究了地方工业发展速度问题，认为还要快搞、多搞、抓紧搞
    新华社南昌29日电　中共江西省委在28日召开常委扩大会议，根据总路线的精神专门检查和研究了江西地方工业的发展速度问题。
    会议认为，今年工业生产和基本建设计划的完成情况比以往任何一年都好，但根据今年跃进计划的要求，现在的速度还是不能令人满意的；尤其在基本建设方面，有些可以抓紧搞起来的没有抓紧搞起来，有些可以快搞的没有快搞，有些可以多搞的没有多搞。其原因是思想没有彻底解放，对总路线的领会和贯彻不够，对大中小型企业同时并举的方针坚持不够，有重大轻小、重机械化轻土办法和坐等机械化的毛病。针对这种情况，会议确定立即在全省掀起一个加快工业建设速度的新高潮，在生产方面，要求上半年坚决完成全年跃进计划的45％以上，基本建设项目要求凡是具备了条件的要赶快上马，已经上马的要快马加鞭加快建设速度，条件还不具备的要千方百计地创造条件争取早日完成准备工作。总之，无论生产或建设，都应抓紧时间加强领导，加强协作，加快速度。
    会议研究了加快工业建设速度的措施，认为首先要大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，坚决贯彻总路线，通过大规模的宣传，使总路线深入人心，成为推动新的工业生产高潮、实现跃进计划的动力。会议认为，坚决贯彻执行大中小型企业同时并举的方针是当前加快工业建设速度一个重要方面，为此会议确定，在兴办大中型的钢铁厂、炼油厂、化肥厂的同时，要积极兴办小型厂矿。如小型炼铁厂，会议确定今年全省要兴建一百八十九个，年产量达到二十二万多吨，兴建小型炼油厂八十九个，年产量达到五万五千吨。这些小型厂矿投资少、设备简单，省内自己可以解决，因此它可很快建成投入生产。在全面跃进全面发展中根据本省的条件抓紧九个重点项目的建设，是江西省委加快工业建设速度所采取的另一个措施。会议确定，今年集中力量发展农业机械、动力、燃料和钢铁原材料的生产，以便支援农业大跃进和保障今后工业的发展。为此，会议对今年工业资金的使用和设备的分配作了调整。为了加快工业建设的速度，会议确定建立和健全各级党委的工业领导机构，并抽调干部加强工业战线。此外，会议还对若干影响建设速度的不合理的规章制度初步进行了审查和修订。
    加快工业发展的速度，是中共江西省委近来一直在注意研究的问题。前几天省委召开了全省电话会议，向各级党委和全省人民提出了加快工业建设速度的号召。接着，省委又召开了有四十个县参加的发展小型厂矿的会议，在这个会议上进一步讨论了地方工业以小型为主的方针，并作出了大力发展小型厂矿的规划。
