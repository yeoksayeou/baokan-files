U.S. Provocative Conspiracy Against Lebanon
　　Commentator of This Newspaper
    In recent days, the United States' intervention activities and provocative conspiracies against Lebanon have become increasingly evident. The U.S. Sixth Fleet is conducting so-called "exercises" in the Eastern Mediterranean, and many warships have even sailed to within two nautical miles of the Lebanese coast to demonstrate. At the same time, a large number of U.S. military transport aircraft have flown from the United States to West Germany. A U.S. Air Force spokesman said that these aircraft "will be ready to fly to Lebanon at any time." According to the "Washington Post and Times Herald," U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated in a secret report to the bipartisan leaders of the Senate that the United States is "prepared to land U.S. armed forces in Lebanon."
    What exactly is the United States trying to achieve by deploying troops to Lebanon? It makes excuses, as if Lebanon is under external threat. However, this argument is extremely absurd. The Lebanese people have recently launched a vigorous demonstration movement, and what they oppose is precisely the U.S. aggression and threats against Lebanon, especially the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine." Therefore, this excuse of the United States is nothing more than "the thief crying 'stop thief.'" The United States has no right to interfere in the Lebanese situation, and its recent activities only prove that the United States is planning to provoke Lebanon.
    The reason why the United States wants to provoke Lebanon is obviously to suppress the national independence movement of Arab countries and save the bankruptcy of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and all its colonialist plans. In recent years, due to the development of the national independence movement of the countries in the Middle East, the United States' colonialist plans in this region have been constantly frustrated. The United States' attempt to pull many Arab countries into the Baghdad Pact has not succeeded. Moreover, even the Baghdad Pact itself has been paralyzed. The United States wanted to carry out military aggression against Syria, but it was rebuffed. The United States wanted to undermine and obstruct the unity of Arab countries, but Egypt and Syria finally established the United Arab Republic. Now, in Lebanon, with a population of less than two million, the broad masses of the people have raised the banner against the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and their heroic struggle has greatly undermined the "prestige" of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East. It is this situation that has made the U.S. ruling clique, which insists on an aggressive policy, jump up and down. They are shouting and yelling, sharpening their knives, preparing to attack Lebanon and carry out new adventures in the Middle East.
    It should be seen that the United States' recent dangerous intervention activities in Indonesia and its preparation to play with fire in Lebanon are by no means accidental. At present, the U.S. economic crisis is becoming increasingly pressing, and many of the artificial measures taken by the U.S. ruling clique to save the economic crisis have failed. Under such circumstances, the aggressiveness of U.S. foreign policy is strengthening, and some groups in the United States are not only doing their utmost to oppose the relaxation of international tensions, but also plotting to find opportunities to undermine peace in certain regions and create so-called "limited wars." This is something that people should pay attention to and be vigilant about.
    The United States' adventurous plans in Southeast Asia and the Middle East have threatened world peace, so peace-loving people all over the world cannot sit idly by. China and the Soviet Union have separately warned the United States not to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. On May 18, TASS also issued a solemn condemnation of the activities of the United States and other Western countries in interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. The Lebanese people, like the Indonesian people, are not isolated in their struggle. A statement issued by the Lebanese National United Front on the 17th pointed out that Western imperialist countries are preparing to conduct military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, thinking that this will scare the Lebanese people, but, "We can guarantee that the conspirators will find that Lebanon is a country determined to fight against any foreign interference and to achieve the goals of the people." Indeed, with the support of the people of all countries, as long as the Lebanese people strengthen their unity, resolutely oppose U.S. interference, and safeguard the independence and sovereignty of their country, any U.S. interference and provocation can be repelled and defeated.

　　美国对黎巴嫩的挑衅阴谋
　　本报评论员
    最近几天，美国对黎巴嫩的干涉活动和挑衅阴谋已经越来越明显。美国的第六舰队在东地中海举行所谓“演习”，有许多军舰竟开到离黎巴嫩海面二海里的地方示威。同时，大批美国军用运输飞机也由美国飞到西德。美国空军发言人说，这些飞机“将随时准备着飞往黎巴嫩去”。据“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯在向参议院两党领袖所作的秘密报告中曾经表示，美国“准备派美国武装部队到黎巴嫩登陆”。
    美国究竟为了什么要向黎巴嫩调兵遣将呢？它制造借口说，仿佛黎巴嫩受到了外来的威胁。但是，这种论调实在荒唐之至。最近黎巴嫩人民发动轰轰烈烈的示威运动，他们所反对的恰恰是美国对黎巴嫩的侵略和威胁，特别是恶名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”。所以美国的这种借口不过是“做贼喊贼”而已。美国根本没有任何权力干涉黎巴嫩局势，它最近的这些活动只能证明美国是在有计划地向黎巴嫩挑衅。
    美国所以要向黎巴嫩挑衅，显然是想镇压阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动，挽救“艾森豪威尔主义”以及它的全部殖民主义计划的破产。近年以来，由于中近东各国人民的民族独立运动的发展，美国在这个地区的殖民主义计划不断遭受挫败。美国想把许多阿拉伯国家拉入巴格达集团的做法没有成功。而且，就连巴格达集团本身也已经陷于瘫痪状态。美国想对叙利亚进行军事侵略，结果碰了壁。美国想破坏和阻挠阿拉伯国家的团结，但是埃及和叙利亚终于建立了阿拉伯联合共和国。现在，在人口不到两百万的黎巴嫩，广大人民群众又举起了反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗帜，他们的英勇斗争给美帝国主义在中近东的“威风”带来很大的打击。正是这种局势使坚持侵略政策的美国统治集团暴跳起来。他们大喊大叫，磨刀霍霍，准备向黎巴嫩开刀，在中近东进行新的冒险。
    应该看到，美国最近一边在印度尼西亚进行危险的干涉活动，一边又准备在黎巴嫩玩火，这绝对不是偶然的事情。目前美国经济危机正日益逼人，美国统治集团挽救经济危机的许多人为措施都已经失灵了。在这种情况下，美国对外政策的侵略性正在加强，美国某些集团不但竭力反对缓和国际紧张局势，而且阴谋寻找机会，在某些地区破坏和平，制造所谓“有限战争”。这是值得人们注意和警惕的。
    美国在东南亚和中近东的冒险计划，已经威胁了世界和平，因此全世界爱好和平人民对此不能坐视不顾。中国和苏联已分别向美国提出警告，不许干涉印度尼西亚内政。5月18日，塔斯社又对美国及其他西方国家干涉黎巴嫩内政的活动提出了严正的谴责。黎巴嫩人民，也正同印度尼西亚人民一样，他们的斗争不是孤立的。黎巴嫩民族统一阵线17日的声明指出：西方帝国主义国家正在准备在地中海东部进行军事演习，它们以为这样就能吓倒黎巴嫩人民，但是，“我们可以保证，阴谋家们将会发现，黎巴嫩是一个决心为反对任何外国干涉和实现人民的目标而进行战斗的国家”。的确，在各国人民的支持下，只要黎巴嫩人民加强团结，坚决反对美国干涉，维护自己国家的独立和主权，那么美国的任何干涉和挑衅都是能够打退和打败的。
