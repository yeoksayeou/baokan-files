Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 13th. Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia, Fuente Bella, recently revealed that Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano supported the rebels in Indonesia.

　　Fuente Bella pointed out at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives on the 6th that Serrano refused to take a non-interventionist stance when the rebellion occurred in Indonesia. He said that Serrano once stated that the Philippine government would recognize the "regime" established by Indonesian rebels after their "victory."

　　Fuente Bella also accused Serrano of allowing Sumual, the head of the Indonesian rebels, to conduct activities in Manila without interfering or deporting him.

　　Fuente Bella was recalled to the country by Serrano in mid-April because he was considered more sympathetic to the Indonesian government. It is reported that the Philippine government's action to recall Fuente Bella was directed by the US State Department. Philippine Senator Mabánag requested the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee to investigate this matter in late April. Recently, the Philippine Congress is listening to reports from Fuente Bella and Serrano and has begun a debate.

　　菲律宾驻印度尼西亚大使揭露菲外长支持叛乱分子
    新华社13日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾驻印度尼西亚大使弗恩特贝拉最近揭露菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺支持印度尼西亚的叛乱分子。
    弗恩特贝拉6日在菲律宾众议院外交委员会会议上指出，在印度尼西亚发生叛乱的时候，塞兰诺拒不采取不干预的立场。他说，塞兰诺曾经表示菲律宾政府将承认印度尼西亚叛乱分子在“胜利”后建立的“政权”。
    弗恩特贝拉还指责塞兰诺让印度尼西亚叛乱分子头目苏穆阿尔在马尼拉进行活动而不加以干涉和驱逐。
    弗恩特贝拉是在4月中旬被塞兰诺召回国内的，由于他被认为比较同情印度尼西亚政府。有消息说，菲律宾政府召回弗恩特贝拉的行动是受美国国务院指使的，菲律宾参议员马巴纳格在4月下旬曾经要求参议院外交委员会对这件事进行调查。最近菲律宾国会正在听取弗恩特贝拉和塞兰诺的报告，并且展开了辩论。
