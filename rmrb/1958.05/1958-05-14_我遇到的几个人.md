　　Some People I Met
　　Liu Jinju
    Old Grandpa Wang Heting
    After I was sent to the countryside, I worked with him a lot, he cared about me and taught me farm work. When I first started working, I used brute force, and the old man told me: there's a lot of farm work, and it takes a long time, it won't be finished in a day or two, you can't use brute force. When there was heavy or difficult work, he would rush to do it first, letting me do the light work. Once, when making straw mats for the sweet potato cellar, he was afraid my hands would hurt, so he wouldn't let me stack them, but asked me to hand him bundles of straw. I insisted on trying, but as a result, because I didn't know how to use the strength, my hands blistered in less than two hours. The old man felt as distressed as if it were his own hands, and he wouldn't let me stack them no matter what. He also taught me how to work by showing me how. When making straw mats, he patiently taught me how to thread the hemp warp, how to hand over the straw, even every crucial step of the process. In this way, in ten days, he taught me seven or eight kinds of farm work such as mixing manure, spreading manure, planting fields with a roller, and building sweet potato cellars. He was truly a good old man!
    Sister-in-law Liu
    I lived in Sister-in-law Liu's house. The second day I participated in labor, I went to the fields to dig up weeds. Sister-in-law Liu knew I would be thirsty, so at around ten o'clock in the morning, she asked her daughter to bring me a cup of boiled water. Another time, I went to the township for a meeting. Sister-in-law Liu was afraid I would be hungry, so she insisted that I take food with me. I thought the meeting would be over in half a day, so I didn't take any. Unexpectedly, the meeting went on until after ten o'clock in the afternoon. Just after noon, Sister-in-law Liu asked her daughter to bring me steamed sweet potato slices. When I came back, Sister-in-law Liu said to me: You can't do this next time, you must take food with you when you go out.
    Grandpa Ma
    I went to the northern mountains, fifteen miles from home, to plant trees. After it was finished, I walked back with two other sent-down comrades along a mountain path. This mountain path was indeed difficult to walk, we had to cross four ridges, and they were all rugged paths. We crossed one ridge, then another, not knowing which path was the right one. Just as we were getting anxious, we discovered a small village at the foot of the mountain – Little River Village. Five villagers were building sweet potato cellars, so we went up and asked them. After we started climbing the ridge, the five villagers were still watching us. As we walked to the top of the mountain, they shouted loudly from behind: Go up and you'll find a clear path! Take the path going due south! We couldn't hear clearly, so an old man in his fifties, Grandpa Ma, ran to the top of the mountain, pointed out the path for us, and insisted on escorting us home. After we left, the old man was still watching us from the top of the mountain.

　　我遇到的几个人
　　刘进举
    王鹤亭老大爷
    下放后，我跟他一起干活的时候多，他关心我，教我农活。我初一干活是楞劲，老大爷就告诉我：农活多着呢，长着呢，不是一天两早晨就完了，不能使楞劲。有重活或不好干的活，他先抢着干了，让我干轻活。一次，打盖薯炕的草帘子，他怕我手疼，不叫我摞，叫我给他递草把，我坚持要试试，结果，因为我不会使这股劲儿，不到两个钟头，手就出了泡，大爷就像疼他自个一样难受，无论如何再也不叫我摞了。干活也是掰着手教我，打草帘子时，把怎样摞麻经，怎样递草，甚至连每一个工序的节骨眼都耐心地教给我。就这样，十天的工夫，教会了我捣粪、送粪、种地拉滚子、上薯炕等七、八种农活。真是个好老大爷！
    刘大嫂
    我住在刘大嫂家里。参加劳动的第二天，下地去打圪拉，刘大嫂知道我准渴，上午十点多钟，就叫他女儿拿一杯开水给我送去了。又一次，我到乡去开会，大嫂怕我饿，非叫我带饭不可。我以为半天就能开完会，没带去。没想到，会一直开到下午十点多钟。刚过午，大嫂又叫他女儿把蒸好的白薯干给我送去了。回来大嫂对我说：下回可不能这样作了，出门一定得带饭去。
    马大爷
    我到离家十五里地的北山去造林。造完了，和另外两个下放的同志走山道回来。这个山道确实不好走，得翻四道岭，还都是崎岖小道。我们过一道岭，又过一道岭，不知道走那条道对了。正着急，发现山脚下一个小村庄——小河庄，有五个老乡在打薯炕，就上前打听了一下。我们上岭走了，这五位老乡还在望着我们。我们走上山头，他们在后面高声喊着：往上走就有明道！走正南去的道！我们听不清，一位五十多岁的马老大爷，就跑上山头，指给了我们道，还一定要送我们到家，我们走了，老大爷还在山顶上看着我们。
