Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: More than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the CPPCC Auditorium this evening to warmly welcome the messengers from the fraternal neighboring country – the Korean People's Delegation to China.

The meeting hall was adorned with the national flags of China and Korea, and the rostrum was decorated with blooming flowers and evergreen palms. At 8:00 PM sharp, delegation leader Xu Zhenshu, deputy leader Jin Tianhai, and all the distinguished guests of the delegation, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and others, entered the venue. At this moment, the band played welcoming music, and a torrential downpour of applause reverberated throughout the hall for a long time.

Also seated on the rostrum with the distinguished guests were Chen Shutong and Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress, Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice Shi Liang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs Wang Yifu, Korean Ambassador to China Li Yonghao, and the heads of the three northeastern provinces who cared for Korean war orphans – Jilin Province Governor Li Youwen, Liaoning Province Vice Governor Li Tao, and Heilongjiang Province Vice Governor Li Yanlu.

The welcoming rally began with the band playing the national anthems of Korea and China. Chairman Guo Moruo first delivered a speech, warmly welcoming the distinguished guests from heroic Korea on behalf of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people. He said that the Korean people are the closest friends of the Chinese people. The brotherly friendship between our two peoples is forged in blood. Both our countries are socialist countries guided by Marxism-Leninism, and both are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the friendship between our two peoples is even more intimate and unbreakable.

Guo Moruo then spoke about the efforts made by China and Korea to ease the tense situation in the Far East and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. He pointed out that the first phase of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers has been successfully completed. On the contrary, the American imperialists have not only failed to take any positive measures in terms of troop withdrawal, but are also constantly carrying out various provocative activities. This shows that the American imperialists are一心想阻挠朝鲜和平统一、继续制造远东紧张局势. However, at present, the call for maintaining world peace is getting louder and louder, and the proportion of peaceful forces is becoming more and more dominant. Any aggressive conspiracy of the United States is bound to be defeated.

Guo Moruo finally emphasized that the Chinese people will always work together with the heroic Korean people to oppose imperialist aggression and safeguard peace in the Far East. He said that the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland has been supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. We firmly believe that through the continuous efforts of the Korean people and the continuous support of peace-loving people all over the world, the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely achieve peaceful reunification.

Next, delegation leader Xu Zhenshu delivered a long speech amidst prolonged applause. She said that in the great Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against imperialism and its lackey, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, the fraternal Chinese people sent their outstanding sons and daughters to Korea, forming the Volunteer Army, and used their blood to assist the Korean people. The profound love and support of the Chinese people for the Korean people is only possible under such circumstances. This is because internationalist thought has tightly linked the two peoples together and forged a friendly and united relationship in the long-term common struggle against imperialist aggressors.

Xu Zhenshu sternly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in undermining Korean reunification, occupying the southern half of the Republic, and occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and pointed out that the struggle of the Korean people to unify their country and the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will surely achieve final victory.

She said that we, the Korean people, with the support of the great Soviet Union, China, and the fraternal socialist countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, will surely drive the American imperialists out of our territory, will surely defend forever the socialist achievements achieved through creative labor struggles, and will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

Delegation leader Xu Zhenshu's enthusiastic speech constantly won long and warm applause. After the speech, the Korean People's Delegation to China presented a banner to the China People's National Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, thanking the Chinese people for their care of Korean war orphans. At this time, the sounds of music and applause merged into one in the venue, lasting for a long time.

After the rally, the distinguished guests watched a performance of Peking Opera.

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and four others were awarded the highest honor of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – the First Class National Flag Order – in Beijing this evening.

The other four recipients are Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai, Liaoning Province Governor Du Zheheng (accepted by Vice Governor Li Tao on his behalf), Jilin Province Governor Li Youwen, and Heilongjiang Province Governor Ouyang Qin (accepted by Vice Governor Li Yanlu on his behalf).

The grand award ceremony was held at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China.

At the award ceremony, Jin Tianhai, Deputy Leader of the Korean People's Delegation to China, read the decree of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on awarding the Order to citizens of the People's Republic of China who have made contributions to the protection and care of Korean war orphans and children of patriotic martyrs.

Then, delegation leader Xu Zhenshu, entrusted by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, pinned the gleaming gold medals, which embodied the gratitude of the entire Korean people, on the chests of Guo Moruo and others. At this moment, more than a thousand people participating in the award ceremony all stood up, with thunderous applause, and the band played joyous music.

Delegation leader Xu Zhenshu delivered a congratulatory speech amidst warm applause. She said: The Korean People's Delegation to China is entrusted by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and feels supremely honored to be able to award the Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comrades who have protected and cared for many Korean orphans who lost their beloved parents due to the barbaric atrocities of American executioners and the Li Chengwan bandit gang, as if they were their own flesh and blood.

Xu Zhenshu said: More than 22,000 Korean war orphans, since 1952, under the close-as-flesh-and-blood care of the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, have entered 47 primary colleges and nurturing homes set up in the northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and have been cultivated into outstanding talents who are physically and mentally healthy, educated, and skilled. Among them, 7,000 have already returned to their country and are working in various departments as a great army for national construction. The many orphans you have nurtured are the crystallization of your blood and sweat; they will live forever in the hearts of the Korean people as a link and symbol of the friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples.

Xu Zhenshu said: The Korean people will pass on the proletarian internationalist achievements established by the comrades, generation after generation, to their descendants forever. I firmly believe that this glorious achievement will make a significant contribution to further deepening and strengthening the friendship and solidarity between the two peoples.

Xie Juezai delivered a reply speech. He expressed his deep gratitude and high respect to the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean People's Delegation to China headed by delegation leader Xu Zhenshu on behalf of the recipients. He said: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has given us such a lofty honor, which makes us feel very honored. We believe that this honor should belong to the broad masses of the Chinese people. In the work of caring for Korean war orphans, although certain achievements have been made in recent years, this is mainly due to the joint efforts of Chinese and Korean personnel based on the agreement between the governments of China and Korea. The role we individuals have played in this work is negligible. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has awarded us the First Class National Flag Order, which is another manifestation of the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people. We will continue to work together with the entire Chinese people to continuously strengthen the friendship and solidarity between China and Korea. Xie Juezai said: Although we Chinese people have done some work for the care of Korean war orphans for six years, we deeply know that there are still many shortcomings in our work, and we need to continue to work hard, especially to do a good job in all the work before the Korean war orphans return to their country, in order to thank the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the honor and encouragement given to us.

    首都各界人民举行盛大集会
    欢迎来自英雄朝鲜的贵宾
    朝鲜最高人民会议常委会授予郭沫若等五人以最高勋章
    据新华社6日讯　首都各界人民一千多人今晚在政协礼堂举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎来自兄弟邻邦的使者——朝鲜人民访华代表团。
    大会会场高悬着中朝两国国旗，主席台上摆着盛开的鲜花和常青的棕榈。八时正，许贞琡团长、金天海副团长和代表团全体贵宾由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若等人陪同进入会场。这时，乐队奏起欢迎乐曲，急雨般的掌声长时间地振荡在整个会场。
    陪同贵宾们在主席台上就坐的，还有和大副主席陈叔通、廖承志，内务部长谢觉哉，司法部长史良，外交部副部长曾涌泉，内务部副部长王一夫，朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐，以及抚育朝鲜战灾孤儿的东北三省的负责人——吉林省省长栗又文，辽宁省副省长李涛，黑龙江省副省长李延禄。
    欢迎大会在乐队高奏朝中两国国歌后开始。郭沫若主席首先致词，以和大和中国人民的名义热烈欢迎来自英雄朝鲜的贵宾。他说，朝鲜人民是中国人民最亲密的朋友。我们两国人民兄弟般的友谊是用鲜血凝结成的。我们两国都是以马克思、列宁主义为指导思想的社会主义国家，都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员。因此，我们两国人民的友谊更是亲密无间、牢不可破的。
    郭沫若接着谈到了中朝两国对和缓远东紧张局势和和平解决朝鲜问题所作的努力。他指出，中国人民志愿军第一批撤军工作已顺利结束，相反的美帝国主义在撤军方面不仅没有采取任何积极的措施，反而还在不断地进行各种挑衅活动。这就说明，美帝国主义一心想阻挠朝鲜和平统一、继续制造远东紧张局势。但是，在目前维护世界和平的呼声正越来越响亮，和平力量的比重正越来越占优势，美国的任何侵略阴谋是必然会遭受失败的。
    郭沫若最后强调指出，中国人民将永远同英雄的朝鲜人民一道，为反对帝国主义的侵略和保卫远东的和平而努力。他说，朝鲜人民争取自己祖国和平统一的正义斗争，是得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持的。我们坚决相信：经过朝鲜人民的不断努力和全世界爱好和平人民的不断支持，朝鲜的三千里锦绣河山是一定能够实现和平统一的。
    接着，许贞琡团长在经久不息的欢迎掌声中发表了长篇讲话。她说，在朝鲜人民反对帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的伟大的祖国解放战争中，兄弟般的中国人民派遣了自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军到朝鲜，用鲜血援助朝鲜人民。中国人民对朝鲜人民的深厚热爱和支援，只有在这种情况下才有可能，这就是国际主义思想已经把两国人民紧紧地联结在一起，并且在反对帝国主义侵略者的长期共同斗争中结成了友好团结关系。
    许贞琡严厉地谴责了美帝国主义破坏朝鲜统一、霸占共和国南半部和中国领土台湾的罪行，并且指出朝鲜人民统一祖国和中国人民解放台湾的斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。
    她说，我们朝鲜人民，在伟大的苏联、中国和兄弟般的社会主义阵营各国的朋友以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会把美帝国主义赶出我们的疆土，一定会永远捍卫住通过创造性的劳动斗争所取得的社会主义成果，一定会达成祖国的和平统一。
    许贞琡团长的热情讲话，不断博得长时间的热烈掌声。讲话结束后，朝鲜人民访华代表团向中国人民抗美援朝总会献旗，感谢中国人民对朝鲜战灾孤儿的抚育。这时，会场上乐曲声和掌声融成一片，经久不息。
    大会结束后，贵宾们观看了京剧表演。
    新华社6日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若等五人，今晚在北京接受了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会授予的最高荣誉——一级国旗勋章。
    另外四位受勋的人是内务部部长谢觉哉，辽宁省省长杜者蘅（由副省长李涛代为接受），吉林省省长栗又文，黑龙江省省长欧阳钦（由副省长李延禄代为接受）。
    隆重的授勋仪式是在首都各界人民欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团大会上举行的。
    在授勋仪式上，朝鲜人民访华代表团副团长金天海宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会关于授予在保护和抚育朝鲜战灾孤儿和爱国烈士子女工作中有功的中华人民共和国公民勋章的政令。
    接着，许贞琡团长受朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会的委托，把凝结着全体朝鲜人民感谢盛意的金光闪闪的勋章佩戴在郭沫若等人的胸前。这时，参加授勋仪式的一千多人，全体起立，掌声雷动，乐队奏起了欢乐的乐曲。
    许贞琡团长在热烈的掌声中致祝词。她说：朝鲜人民访华代表团
  受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议的委托，能够把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的勋章授给像亲骨肉一般保护和抚育由于美国郐子手和李承晚匪帮的野蛮暴行而失去亲爱父母的朝鲜许多孤儿的有功同志，感到无上光荣。
    许贞琡说：数达两万二千多的朝鲜战灾孤儿，从1952年起，在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民亲如骨肉般的关怀下，进入设在贵国东北辽宁、吉林和黑龙江等省的四十七个初等学院和爱育院，被培养成为身心健康、有教养又有技术的优秀人才，其中有七千名已经归国，作为祖国建设的大军，在各个部门工作。你们抚育的这许多孤儿，就是你们的血汗结晶；他们将作为朝中两国人民友谊的纽带和标志，永远活在朝鲜人民心中。
    许贞琡说：朝鲜人民将把同志们所建立的无产阶级国际主义业绩，一代一代地永远传给自己的后代。我深信，这种光辉业绩，将对进一步加深和加强两国人民的友谊和团结作出重大贡献。
    谢觉哉致答词。他代表受勋人向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会和以许贞琡团长为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团表示深切的感谢和崇高的敬意。他说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会给予我们这样崇高的荣誉，使我们感到非常光荣。我们认为这种光荣应该属于广大中国人民。在抚养朝鲜战灾孤儿的工作中，几年来虽然获得了一定的成绩，但这主要是根据中朝两国政府的协议，经过中朝两国工作人员的共同努力获得的。我们个人在这一工作中所起的作用是微不足道的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会把一级国旗勋章授予我们，这是朝鲜人民对中国人民的深厚友谊的又一表现，我们今后将继续同全中国人民一道，为不断加强中朝两国的友谊和团结而努力工作。谢觉哉说：六年来，我们中国人民为抚养朝鲜战灾孤儿虽然作了一些工作，但是，我们深深知道，我们工作中还有很多缺点，还需要继续努力工作，特别是应该作好朝鲜战灾孤儿回国前的一切工作，以答谢朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会所给予我们的荣誉和鼓励。（附图片）
