    Respectable People's Teacher
    On the afternoon of April 28th, a fierce wind raised a huge amount of yellow sand, filling the entire sky above Baiyin City. It was difficult to see people coming towards you, and walking was very difficult. I returned home from the office after 6 o'clock. When I entered the house, I saw that the eldest child, Ru Lin, had not yet returned. I thought that maybe she was walking slower because of the wind, and she would be back in a while. But two hours passed, and she still hadn't returned. It was getting dark, and I was getting worried. Could something have happened? The more I thought about it, the more anxious I became. I wanted to go look for her, but there were still two young children at home with no one to look after them. But the clock had struck past nine o'clock, and my mood became even more uneasy as time passed. Just as I was in this state of anxiety, Ru Lin returned. I opened the door and saw that four teachers had brought her back, with a teacher's cotton jacket draped over her. At that moment, I was so moved that I didn't know what to say.
    After the teachers left, Ru Lin told me: When school was dismissed, the wind was blowing fiercely. The teachers were afraid that we would be blown away by the wind, so they kept several of us who lived far away behind. The teachers were afraid that we were hungry, so they went to the cafeteria to buy some food and steamed buns for us to eat. The teachers originally said they would let a few of us stay at the school, but later they considered that our parents might be worried, so they decided to brave the wind and send us home. On the road, taking one high step and then one low step, the teachers helped us walk. When the wind and sand attacked our faces, the four teachers stood side by side and told us to hide behind them. The teacher saw that I was wearing too little clothing, so she took off her own cotton jacket and put it on me. Teacher Jin was probably freezing.
    Hearing this, I deeply felt the superiority of the new society and the noble qualities of being a people's teacher in the new China. The teachers' ability to wholeheartedly and diligently dedicate everything to cultivating the next generation for the country is inseparable from the Party's education and cultivation.
    People's teachers like these are truly admirable and are also good examples for other teachers and comrades to learn from. Li Ziduan (with picture)

    可敬的人民教师
    4月28日下午，激烈的狂风扬起了万丈黄沙，弥漫了整个白银市的上空。迎面看不见人，行路都非常困难。我从办公室回到家里已是六点多了。进屋一看，大孩子如林还没有回家。我想可能是因风大走得慢一些，等一会就会回来的。可是两个钟头过去了，她还没有回家。天色已渐渐黑了，我心里有些着急起来，是不是出了意外呢？我越想越着急，去找吧，家里还有两个小孩没有人看，可是时钟已敲过了九点，我的心情随着时间的消逝，更加忐忑不安。正在这焦急万分的时候，如林回来了。我开门一看，是四位老师送她回来的，身上披着一件老师的棉上衣，当时使我感动得不知说什么是好。
    老师们走后，如林告诉我：放学的时候风刮的正紧，老师怕我们被风刮丢了，便将我们几个道远的同学留下来了。老师怕我们肚子饿，又到食堂买了一些菜和馒头给我们吃了，本来老师说留我们几个人住在学校里，后来又考虑到怕家长担心着急，所以又决定冒风送我们回家。在路上，一脚高一脚低的，老师搀着我们走，当风沙迎面袭来的时候，四个老师就并排的站着，叫我们躲在他们的后面。老师见我穿的少，就将自己的棉衣脱下来给我披上，可能金老师自己都冻坏了。
    我听到这里，深深感觉到新社会的优越性，和做一个新中国的人民教师的高贵品质。老师们能够全心全意勤勤恳恳为国家培养第二代献出一切力量是与党的教育与培养分不开的。
    像这样的人民教师实在是使人敬佩，也是其他教师们和工作同志们学习的好榜样。　李子端（附图片）
