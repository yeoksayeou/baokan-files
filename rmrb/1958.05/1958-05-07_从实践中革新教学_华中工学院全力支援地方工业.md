    Reforming Teaching Through Practice
    Huazhong Institute of Technology Fully Supports Local Industry
    (Our newspaper, reporter Yin Ping) Huazhong Institute of Technology is actively reforming its teaching and scientific research work, adopting various methods to serve local industry, and powerfully supporting the development of local industry.
    Since early April, Huazhong Institute of Technology has begun to pay attention to the issue of serving local industry. They have successively organized four work groups, dispatched to Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, and Hubei, to understand the local industrial development and the urgent scientific and technological problems to be solved. Immediately afterwards, various activities to support local industry were launched at the school. More than seven hundred graduating students enthusiastically threw themselves into this activity, and they changed all of their graduation designs for this semester to meet the needs of local industrial production. Under the guidance of teachers, they assisted various regions in designing small and medium-sized hydropower stations, factory buildings, motors, electrical appliances, and other equipment. In the school's practice factories, about four hundred teachers and students worked busily and happily every day. They are producing more than a dozen products such as bench drills, lathes, shapers, tractor gears, and generators, preparing to produce more than 7 million yuan worth of industrial products for local industry this year. Scientific and technological cooperation groups for tractors, hydropower generation, and chemical fertilizers, with teachers from more than a dozen teaching and research groups participating, have also begun to collect information and carry out various specific research work to help solve some technical problems in local industry.
    Huazhong Institute of Technology has adopted a variety of methods to support local industrial activities. The most important is to combine scientific research and teaching. They incorporate the technical problems related to local industry raised by various regions into teaching and scientific research plans, organize forces to jointly study and solve them, and all graduation designs, course designs, teaching internships, and other activities are combined with local industrial production, which not only enriches teaching content, but also helps solve the technical problems of local industry. Secondly, is to widely carry out work-study programs to support local industry through the production of practice factories. This year, about 80% or more of the industrial products they produce are used to meet the needs of local industry. Another method is to train cadres for local industry in various ways. They have decided to expand enrollment and hold old cadre classes, specialized courses, correspondence schools, and evening schools to train engineers, senior technicians, and management personnel for local industry without increasing faculty or equipment. In order to meet the urgent needs of local industry, they are also preparing to hold half-month or one-month short-term training courses to train a group of technicians who can be responsible for the installation and management of small hydropower stations.
    After Huazhong Institute of Technology has been oriented toward local industry, it has not only helped local industry solve some technical problems, but also enriched the teaching content. The most urgent problem for local industry at present is that the technical strength of design, etc., cannot keep up. The masses in many places raise funds to automatically build hydropower stations, thermal power stations, and various small factories, but they cannot start construction because there are no personnel to undertake the design tasks of factory buildings and equipment. After learning about this situation, Huazhong Institute of Technology immediately set out to solve this problem. They have already contracted eleven hydropower stations, six thermal power stations, and the design tasks of combined machine tools, generators, etc., and are collecting data and conducting design work. For a small number of places with particularly weak technical strength, they not only undertake the design tasks, but also contract all the survey and installation work. In order to quickly and timely meet the needs of local industry, they have also studied the popular standard design problems of various types of hydropower stations, combined machine tools, etc., and are preparing to create a set of design models and drawings in the short term to help various regions solve the difficulties of starting local industries. The supply of various small agricultural tools and generators is also very urgent for various regions. In addition to making full use of practice factories to produce products for local industry, Huazhong Institute of Technology is also conducting trial production of new products such as small tractors and generators. Huazhong Institute of Technology is also signing contracts with factories in various places to solve the various technical problems in production and the training of technical cadres in a timely manner. When carrying out these activities, many teaching and research groups have changed their past practices of not going to factories and not combining with practice, and have begun to be linked to factories, often taking turns to participate in actual operations and study the technical problems in production, and then use practical production knowledge to enrich or streamline teaching content. In order to change the phenomenon of theory being divorced from reality, the Production Organization Teaching and Research Office has moved entirely to the practice factory, determined to improve teaching through practice. The graduation designs and course designs made by the students have also been generally improved in quality due to their close combination with production, and they have begun to be used to solve practical problems.
    The activities of Huazhong Institute of Technology to support local industry were proposed during the Double-Anti Movement. In the Double-Anti Movement, they not only calculated economic accounts and found that the utilization rate of teaching equipment was not high and there was potential to serve local industry. They also settled ideological accounts, exposed erroneous tendencies such as teaching being divorced from production and theory being divorced from practice, launched a great debate, initially criticized various bourgeois teaching thoughts, and decided to face local industry and reform teaching and scientific research work. At this time, local industry in various regions developed rapidly, and the Party committee timely called on everyone to recognize this new situation and contribute to the development of local industry. At the same time, worker representatives, commune members, and management cadres from factories and enterprises also came to the school to request the school to provide technical support to local industry. These have further encouraged the enthusiasm of teachers and students to support local industry. At present, Huazhong Institute of Technology is further revising its teaching and scientific research plans, continuing to criticize the idea of not attaching importance to serving local industry, and clearly incorporating the support of local industry into the teaching and scientific research plans, and carrying out fundamental reforms in content and methods. In scientific research, we must not only solve the various problems in the development of local industry in a timely manner, but also further solve the problem of scientific collaboration with factories and enterprises; in teaching, we must implement the "one, three, eight" system (that is, one month of rest, three months of labor, and eight months of study), so that students can regularly participate in production labor, and all professional courses will be added or streamlined in combination with the actual needs of industrial production, and students' experiments, internships, and course designs will all be combined with local industrial production.

    从实践中革新教学
    华中工学院全力支援地方工业
    本报讯　记者殷平报道：华中工学院积极革新教学和科学研究工作，采取各种办法来为地方工业服务，有力地支援了地方工业的发展。
    4月初旬以来，华中工学院就开始注意为地方工业服务的问题了。他们先后组织了四个工作组，分赴江西、湖南、河南和湖北等地，了解地方工业发展情况和亟待解决的科学技术问题。紧接着，支援地方工业的各种活动就在这个学校里展开了。七百多个应届毕业学生热情地投入了这一活动，他们把本学期要作的毕业设计全部改为结合地方工业生产需要来作。在教师指导下，帮助各地进行中、小型水电站、工厂厂房、电机、电器等各种设备的设计工作。在院内的实习工厂里，每天都有四百左右的教师和学生紧张、愉快地劳动着，他们正在制作台钻、车床、牛头刨床、拖拉机齿轮、发电机等十多种产品，准备在今年内为地方工业生产出七百多万元的工业产品。有着十多个教研组教师参加的拖拉机、水力发电、化学肥料等科学技术协作小组，也已开始进行收集资料的准备工作和各项具体的研究工作，帮助解决地方工业中的一些技术问题。
    华中工学院在支援地方工业活动中，采取了多种多样的方法。最主要的是结合科学研究和教学进行，他们把各地提出的有关地方工业的技术问题，纳入教学和科学研究计划中，组织力量共同研究和解决，所有毕业设计、课程设计、教学实习等活动，都结合着地方工业生产进行，既丰富了教学内容，又帮助解决了地方工业的技术问题。其次，就是广泛地开展勤工俭学活动，从实习工厂的生产上来支援地方工业。今年，他们生产的工业产品，约有80％以上都是用来满足地方工业的需要的。另一种办法就是采取多种方式为地方工业培养干部。他们决定在不增加师资、设备的情况下，扩大招生名额，举办老干部班、专修科、函授学校、业余学校，来为地方工业培养工程师、高级技术员和管理人员。为了适应地方工业的迫切需要，还准备举办半月、一月的短期训练班，培训一批能够担任小型水电站安装、管理任务的技术工人。
    华中工学院在面向地方工业以后，既帮助地方工业解决了一些技术问题，又丰富了教学内容。当前地方工业最迫切需要解决的问题是设计等技术力量跟不上，许多地方群众集资自动地兴建水电站、火电站和各种小型工厂，但因没有人员承担厂房设备等的设计任务，不能动工兴建。华中工学院在了解这一情况后，立即着手解决了这个问题。他们已经承包了十一个水电站、六个火电站和联合机床、发电机等设计任务，正在收集资料和进行设计工作。对少数技术力量特别薄弱的地方，他们不仅承担设计任务，还把勘测、安装等工作全部包下来。为了迅速、及时地满足地方工业的需要，他们还研究了各种类型水电站、联合机床等的通俗化标准设计问题，准备在短期内制出一套设计模型和图纸，来帮助各地解决创办地方工业的困难。各地对各种小型农具、发电机的供应也是十分迫切的，华中工学院除了充分利用实习工厂为地方工业生产产品外，还正在进行小型拖拉机、发电机等新产品的试制工作。对生产中的各种技术问题和培训技术干部工作，华中工学院也正在与各地的工厂订立合同，及时地来加以解决。在进行这些活动时，许多教研组改变了过去不下工厂、不与实际相结合的作风，开始与工厂挂上了钩，经常轮流到工厂参加实际操作，研究生产中的技术问题，再根据实际生产知识来充实或精简教学内容。生产组织教研室为了改变理论脱离实际的现象，已经全部搬到了实习工厂，决心从实践中改进教学。学生们所作的毕业设计、课程设计，也由于紧密地结合生产进行，质量普遍有了提高，开始能够用来解决实际问题了。
    华中工学院支援地方工业的活动是在双反运动中提出来的。他们在双反运动中，不仅算了经济账，发现教学设备利用率不高，有潜力为地方工业服务。而且清算了思想账，揭发出教学脱离生产、理论脱离实际等错误偏向，开展了大辩论，初步批判了形形色色的资产阶级教学思想，决定要面向地方工业，改革教学和科学研究工作。就在这时，各地的地方工业有了飞速的发展，党委及时地号召大家认识这一新的形势，为地方工业贡献力量。同时，各地的工人代表、社员代表和工厂企业的管理干部也都纷纷来到学校，要求学校从技术上支援地方工业。这些都更加鼓舞着师生们支援地方工业的热情。目前，华中工学院正在进一步修订教学、科学研究计划，继续批判不重视为地方工业服务的思想，明确地把支援地方工业列入教学计划和科学研究计划里，从内容、方法上进行根本改革。科学研究方面不仅要及时解决地方工业发展中的各种问题，而且要进一步解决与工厂企业进行科学协作的问题；教学上要实行“一、三、八”制（即一月休息、三月劳动、八月学习），让学生能够定期地参加生产劳动，所有专业课程都将结合工业生产实际需要进行增添或精简，学生的实验、实习和课程设计也将全部结合地方工业生产进行。
