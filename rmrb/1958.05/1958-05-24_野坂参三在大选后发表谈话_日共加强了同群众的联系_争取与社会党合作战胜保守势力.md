Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered a speech today, after the results of the Japanese general election were announced. He called on all party members to learn from the experiences of the election struggle, and to continue working hard to strengthen the party's power and stand at the forefront of the mass struggle.

　　When talking about the election results, Nozaka Sanzō said that the Communist Party had greatly strengthened its ties with the masses during the election process and had received support from trade union organizations and other democratic groups. He said that, however, due to the reactionary forces' hostile propaganda and suppression, the Communist Party was not able to obtain the number of seats it had anticipated. This was due to objective reasons, but also to some subjective reasons. He said that we should face the facts and improve our work with the masses. When talking about the need to strengthen the unity of democratic forces, he pointed out that, based on the lessons learned from this election, the Communist Party has set itself the task of striving to cooperate with the Socialist Party in establishing a united front of democratic forces in order to defeat the conservative forces.

　　At the same time, Shiga Yoshio, who was elected as a member of parliament by the Japanese Communist Party, said in Osaka that the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet to be formed is bound to encounter various difficult issues, such as the relationship between Japan and China. It will also attempt to revise the constitution, implement a single-seat constituency system, and expand armaments. Under these circumstances, in order not to betray the expectations of the masses, the Communist Party must join hands with the Socialist Party to launch a struggle to defeat these conspiracies.

    野坂参三在大选后发表谈话
    日共加强了同群众的联系
    争取与社会党合作战胜保守势力
    据新华社23日讯　日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三在日本大选揭晓的今天发表谈话，号召全体党员从大选斗争中学习经验，进一步为加强党的力量，站在群众斗争的前列而继续努力。
    野坂参三在谈到选举结果时说，共产党在竞选过程中大大加强了同群众的联系，并且得到了工会组织和其他民主团体方面的支持。他说，但是，由于反动势力的敌对宣传和镇压，共产党没有能够获得它所预计得到的席位。这是客观原因。但是也有一些主观上的原因。他说，我们应当正视事实，改善群众工作。他在谈到有必要加强民主力量的团结时指出，共产党根据这一次选举中取得的教训，为自己提出了这样一个任务：在建立民主力量统一战线方面争取同社会党进行合作，以便战胜保守势力。
    同时，日本共产党当选为议员的志贺义雄在大阪发表谈话说，即将成立的自由民主党内阁势必要碰到日中关系等种种困难问题。它还将企图修改宪法、实行小选举区制度以及扩充军备等。在这种形势下，共产党为了不辜负人民群众的期望，要同社会党携起手来，展开斗争，击破这些阴谋。
