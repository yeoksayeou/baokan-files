    "Industrial Enterprise Electricity Saving Technology Experience Compilation"
    The Industrial Enterprise Electricity Saving Technology Experience Compilation, compiled by the Electricity Consumption Supervision Department of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, is published in six volumes categorized by industry: Coal Mining and Petroleum, Steel, Machinery, Chemical and Cement, Textile, and Light Industry.
    The electricity-saving technology experiences introduced in the book are closely integrated with enterprise production. For example, some measures to improve heat treatment processes, such as covering a layer of high-melting-point graphite powder on the surface of a medium-temperature salt bath furnace, can reduce insulation power consumption by 40%. Rapid quenching methods and improved resistance furnace heat source devices can increase output while saving electricity. In addition, several improvements in fixtures and tools are also introduced.
    However, the implementation of some measures is not specific enough and needs to be studied in conjunction with the specific circumstances of each factory. Although the effectiveness of some measures is certain and has been reviewed by relevant industrial departments, the methods are not perfect enough and it is hoped that further improvements will be made in practical trials and promotion in the future. There are also some measures whose effects and relationship to output and quality may not be suitable for every enterprise. However, it is still a good reference book for carrying out electricity saving work and researching and tapping the potential for electricity saving.

### “工业企业节约用电技术经验汇编”

    “工业企业节约用电技术经验汇编”
    电力工业部用电监察处汇编的工业企业节约用电技术经验汇编是按工业类别分编为采煤与石油、钢铁、机械、化学与水泥、纺织、轻工业六册出版。
    书中介绍的这些节电技术经验都是与企业生产密切结合的。如一些改进热加工工艺的措施，中温盐浴炉在溶液面上盖一层高溶点石墨粉可以减少保温用电40％，快速淬火法及改进电阻炉热源装置等，都能在节约电力的同时提高产量，此外，还介绍了夹具及刀具的几项改进。
    但是，有些措施的做法还不够具体，需要结合各厂具体情况进行研究。有些措施的效果虽是肯定的，也曾经过有关工业部门进行审查，但作法还不够完善，希望今后在实际试验推广中进一步改进；也还有些措施的效果和对产量、质量的关系不一定适合于每一企业。但对于开展节约用电工作，研究挖掘节约用电潜力来讲，仍然是一本很好的参考书。
