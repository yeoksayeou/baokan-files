My Suggestion

    To Make the Best Use of Everything
    Judging from the situation revealed in the recent "double-anti" movement, some units have an astonishing amount of surplus furniture and supplies. The Beijing Sixth Construction Company alone has a surplus of four to five hundred various office desks, nearly a thousand chairs, more than three hundred abaci, a large number of school desks, forty electron tubes, and valuable audio volume controllers, and so on. To make the best use of everything, the Municipal People's Committee must take unified responsibility for allocation.

    要做到物尽其用
    从最近双反运动中清查出来的情况看，有些单位积压的家具用品，实在是很惊人的。单北京市第六工程公司，就多余各种办公桌四、五百张，椅子近千把，算盘三百多个，还有大量的课桌，四十只电子管及贵重的分具音量器等等。要做到物尽其用，非由市人民委员会统一调配不可。
