　　Observing Flowers and Planting Flowers
　　Yi Huai
　　The Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, after planting an "experimental plot" in the workshop for a while, said to people: "Taking a fleeting glance at flowers is not as good as dismounting to observe them closely, and dismounting to observe them closely is not as good as planting them yourself." What this Deputy Director said is very true. On the road to the Great Leap Forward, new problems will inevitably emerge one after another. If leaders only use the method of observing flowers to find good experiences to solve these problems, it is not enough, and some problems cannot be solved for a while. Personally "planting flowers" purposefully, like the Deputy Director of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, can make up for the shortcomings of "observing flowers." This is indeed a good method.
　　Planting "experimental plots" is naturally a good way to "plant flowers." Leaders can gain a complete set of experiences from sowing to cultivating to harvesting. However, reports from central government agency leaders going deep into the grassroots (see page 4 of the People's Daily on the 12th) show that while "taking a fleeting glance at flowers" and "dismounting to observe flowers closely" in various places, leading cadres can also "plant flowers," acting as gardeners while observing and evaluating flowers, contributing effort and sweat to the growth and flourishing of flowers and trees. Good experiences in actual work are not like the precious flowers in a park, pruned by gardeners to have lush branches and leaves, and labeled, placed in flower rooms for people to admire. When these "good flowers" have not yet been discovered, they are often mixed with ordinary "flowers" and "weeds"; or although they have been recognized as "good flowers," they do not grow luxuriantly and strongly due to improper care and cultivation; or because gardeners have all kinds of concerns in their minds, they dare not cultivate them boldly.... Under such circumstances, if leaders also "plant flowers" while "observing flowers," pruning, removing branches, weeding, catching pests, and applying sufficient fertilizer to these "good flowers," they can make them grow more luxuriantly, so that everyone can see at a glance that they are truly good flowers. The fact is indeed like this, many of the leading cadres who went to various places to "observe flowers" have already done so, therefore, good experiences and good creations emerge one after another. The Director of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, when inspecting work in Wu'an, discovered that the geological explorers there had a serious tendency towards technical conservatism and dared not assert that Wu'an had a large amount of iron ore reserves. The Director helped everyone break through conservative thinking and affirmed that Wu'an's iron ore reserves were not millions of tons but hundreds of millions of tons. Based on this situation, the Director wrote a well-founded article commenting on breaking the technical conservatism tendency in geological exploration work, which had a great impact among engineering technicians and management cadres. This proves that although the time for taking a fleeting glance or dismounting may not be too long, as long as the leaders have the spirit of promoters, they can also grow good flowers!

　　观花和种花
    易槐
    大连机车车辆厂的副厂长兼总工程师在车间种了一阵“试验田”以后，对人说：“走马观花不如下马观花，下马观花不如亲自种花。”这位副厂长的话很对。在跃进的道路上，新问题必然一个连一个的出现，如果领导者只是用观花的办法去寻找解决这些问题的好经验，是不够的，有些问题就一时无法解决。像大连机车车辆厂的副厂长那样有目的的亲自“种花”，就能弥补“观花”的不足。这的确是好办法。
    种“试验田”自然是一种“种花”的好办法。领导者可以从播种到耕耘到收获取得成套的经验。可是，从中央国家机关领导干部深入下层的报道（见人民日报12日第四版）中说明了，到各地去“走马观花”和“下马观花”的同时，领导干部也同样可以“种花”，一边观花、评花，一边充当园丁，为花木的成长繁茂出力流汗。实际工作中的好经验，并不像公园中的名贵花卉一样，被园丁们修整得枝叶繁茂而且插上标签，安放在花房中任人赏玩。当这些“好花”还没有被人发现的时候，往往是和普通的“花”和“杂草”混在一起；或者虽然已被人认出是“好花”，但因为护理和培育不当，生长得并不繁茂茁壮；或者因为园丁的思想上有各种各样的顾虑，而不敢大胆培植……。在这种情况下，领导者如果在“观花”的同时也动手“种花”，为这些“好花”整枝打杈，剪去枝蔓，除去杂草，捉去害虫，施足肥料，就能使它们生长得更为茂盛，使大家一眼都能看出它是真正的好花。事实正是这样的，到各地去“观花”的领导干部，不少人已经这样做了，因此，好经验好创造就层出不穷。冶金部的地质局局长到武安检查工作，发现那里的地质勘探工作者在技术上有严重的保守倾向，不敢肯定武安有大量的铁矿储量。这位局长就帮助大家打破保守思想，肯定了武安的铁矿储量不是几百万吨而是几亿吨。这位局长根据这一情况写了一篇有根据地评述打破地质探勘工作中技术保守倾向的文章，在工程技术人员和管理干部中发生了很大的影响。这证明，虽然走马、下马的时间不会太长，但是，只要领导者具有促进派的精神，同样也能种出好花来！
