    Ancient Huiju Opera

    The successors of ancient Huiju Opera—the children trainees of the Anhui Provincial Huiju Opera Troupe, recently performed more than ten traditional plays such as "Broken Bridge," "San Dang," and "Dragon and Tiger Fight" in Hefei City, bringing a new lease of life to this almost lost Huiju Opera, and received warm welcome from the audience.

    Huiju Opera originated and was popular in the Huizhou and Chizhou areas of Anhui. It occupies an important position in the history of Chinese drama. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Huiju Opera enjoyed a high reputation in Beijing, and it had a great influence on the emergence and development of Peking Opera. After the formation of Peking Opera, Huiju Opera gradually declined and has not been performed for nearly 30 years.

    In order to rescue this opera genre, the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau invited more than a dozen old Huiju Opera artists from 1950 to sort out and collect repertoires, and recruited more than 40 high school graduates in the spring of last year and the beginning of this year to cultivate successors to Huiju Opera.

    古老的徽剧
    古老的徽剧的后继人——安徽省徽剧团儿童学员，最近在合肥市演出了“断桥”、“三挡”、“龙虎斗”等十多个传统剧目，使这个即将失传的徽剧枯木逢春，受到观众热烈的欢迎。
    徽剧发源和流行在安徽的徽州、池州一带，在中国戏剧史上占有重要地位，清朝乾隆年间，徽剧在北京享有盛名，它对京戏的发生和发展有很大影响。京戏形成后，徽戏逐渐雕零，近三十年来没有上演过。
    安徽省文化局为了抢救这个剧种，从1950年就邀请十几位徽剧老艺人，进行整理和搜集剧目的工作，并在去年春和今年年初，先后招收四十多名高小毕业生，培养徽剧的后继人。
