A New Page in the History of Sino-Cambodian Cultural Exchange
丁西林

On the eve of our National Day last year, at the invitation of the Chinese government, the Kingdom of Cambodia sent a Cambodian cultural and artistic delegation to China, headed by Princess Norodom Bopha Devi and Prince Norodom Chakrapong, and led by His Excellency Fang Bingzhen, Deputy Secretary of State of the Cambodian Ministry of Education. The Cambodian classical dance, with a long history and rich national style, performed by the highly accomplished artists of the Kingdom of Cambodia, was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. In particular, the artistic talent of Princess Norodom Bopha Devi and Prince Norodom Chakrapong received unanimous praise from Chinese artists.

In order to thank the Cambodian cultural and artistic delegation for their friendly visit, the Chinese government sent a Chinese cultural and artistic delegation to the Kingdom of Cambodia in early November last year, on the eve of Cambodia's National Day. Similarly, it was warmly welcomed by the Cambodian people. The Chinese music, dance, and drama performed by the relatively young members of the Chinese delegation were also honored to receive the appreciation of the Cambodian people. There is no doubt that these mutual visits by the two cultural and artistic delegations of China and Cambodia have written a new page in the long history of cultural exchange between the two countries.

Recently, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held an exhibition in Beihai, showcasing photos of the mutual visits of the Chinese and Cambodian cultural and artistic delegations, as well as some of the gifts presented by Cambodia to the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation. I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief report on the visit and performance of the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation in Cambodia.

During its visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation received a warm welcome and grand hospitality from the King, Queen, royal family members, many government officials, and the broad masses of the Cambodian people. This fully reflects the long-standing friendly relations between the peoples of China and Cambodia. In order to do a good job in receiving the delegation, the Royal Government established a reception committee with representatives from various relevant departments, personally led by Fang Bingzhen, the head of the previous delegation to China. On November 6, as the Chinese delegation's plane landed at Phnom Penh Airport, the capital of Cambodia, it was warmly welcomed by Princess Norodom Bopha Devi, Minister of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ok Chhun, Minister of State of the Ministry of Information Ting Dong, other senior government officials, the Director of the National Theatre, some members of the Royal Palace Art Troupe, and tens of thousands of people. The delegation's arrival in Phnom Penh coincided with Cambodia's annual Water Festival and the fourth anniversary of the Kingdom of Cambodia's independence. In order to invite the Chinese delegation to watch the dragon boat race of the Water Festival, the reception committee specially built a floating pavilion for the Chinese delegation, and Princess Norodom Bopha Devi and Prince Norodom Chakrapong accompanied them. On the morning of the 9th, all members of our delegation were invited to attend the Independence Day military parade and mass procession. That evening, Princess Norodom Bopha Devi held a reception at Prince Norodom Sihanouk's Sangkum Reastr Niuk别墅, welcoming our delegation. On the evening of the 11th, the Royal Palace Dance Troupe and the National Theatre jointly performed "The Life of Sakyamuni" especially for our delegation. On the evening of the 12th, our delegation performed for the King and Queen at the Royal Palace. After the performance, the King personally awarded medals to the head and deputy head of our delegation, and shook hands with all the members; the Princess and Prince presented flowers to the head and deputy head; and the Royal Palace Dance Troupe presented flowers to all the members. Before the delegation left Phnom Penh to visit the provinces, the King received all the members of the delegation and held a grand banquet to entertain them.

The Chinese cultural and artistic delegation received such grand hospitality in Phnom Penh; from the King, the attitude was so kind; the Queen's care was even more meticulous; all this made everyone in our delegation feel as comfortable and happy as if they were living in a relative's home.

In addition to Phnom Penh, the delegation visited the four provinces of Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Battambang, and Kampot, and performed eight shows. Everywhere they went, the delegation was welcomed by crowds lining the streets, and warmly received by the reception committee jointly formed by the provincial government and local overseas Chinese. When the delegation traveled by car from Phnom Penh to Kampong Cham, the Deputy Governor of Kampong Cham greeted them at the provincial border, more than ninety kilometers from the provincial city; when they traveled from Siem Reap to Battambang, the Governor of Siem Reap and his wife drove their own car to send them to the provincial border, more than fifty kilometers from the provincial city. When visiting other provinces, the governor or the governor's representative also met and saw them off from a long distance. Everywhere they went, in addition to the delegation's performances and the governor's grand reception banquet, the reception committee arranged sightseeing programs for the delegation, usually accompanied by the governor in person. The Governor of Kampong Cham accompanied the delegation to visit what is said to be Asia's first and largest rubber factory and rubber plantation. The rubber plantation covers an area of 30,000 hectares. The Governor of Siem Reap accompanied the delegation to visit the world-famous Angkor monuments. In Battambang, the acting governor accompanied the delegation to visit the city's largest chicken farm; the deputy governor accompanied the delegation to visit the famous Buddhist temples and orchards in the suburbs. In Kampot Province, members of the delegation stayed in several summer villas on the beach of Bokor. Bokor is more than 20 kilometers from Kampot City, backed by mountains and facing the sea, with a cool climate and beautiful scenery.

After returning to Phnom Penh from Kampot Province, in order to meet the demands of the citizens, the delegation added three more performances; one of which was a charity performance to help the victims of a fire in the suburbs of Phnom Penh. On the evening of December 6, Fang Bingzhen, Director of the reception committee, held a farewell banquet for the delegation; at this last banquet, with a feeling of reluctance to part, the delegation expressed its heartfelt gratitude to all the staff of the reception committee, and through them, to the King, Queen, government, and people of Cambodia.

In summary, the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation stayed in Cambodia for more than a month, performing nineteen official performances, with an audience of more than 60,000 people. The performance programs included Peking Opera, folk dance, folk song solo, and national musical instrument performance, as well as Cambodian classical dance learned from the Cambodian delegation to China and Cambodian folk songs learned during the visit to Cambodia. Almost every one of these programs was warmly welcomed by the audience. The evaluation of our artistic level by all parties was also very high. The Cambodian National News Agency and the major newspapers published in Phnom Penh, such as "People's Daily", "Motherland Daily", and "Friendship Daily", wrote editorials and commentaries, not only praising the Chinese art performed by the delegation, but also believing that through the expression of art, one could see the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people after liberation and their sincere friendship with the Cambodian people. The Cambodian classical dance "Fairies in a Blooming Garden" performed by the delegation, although only a superficial understanding was acquired and was not proficient enough, received unanimous praise from all parties. At the first performance at the Royal Palace, the King appreciated and said: "Europeans have also learned Cambodian dance, but no one has been able to learn it so well." When the general audience first saw this program performed, they often mistakenly thought it was performed by Cambodian actors. Why did the Cambodian audience appreciate this program so much? What impact did the Chinese delegation's performance of this program in Cambodia have on the Cambodian people? The "Friendship Daily" in Phnom Penh answered these questions in a short article. This article is very friendly and profound, and is worthy of reflection by young workers in our country engaged in music and dance; therefore, I quote a paragraph from the article below: "Whether they are artists or not, everyone who has seen the performance of the Chinese art delegation unanimously praises the Chinese artists for being able to dance this Cambodian classical dance as skillfully as Khmer artists. Why can Chinese artists absorb and express the tradition and form of Khmer art so deeply? (1) Because China and Cambodia have a long history of close exchanges in culture and art; (2) Because Chinese female artists are familiar with the art of their own country, they can quickly grasp and absorb everything when they learn Cambodian or other countries' art; (3) Because of a good ideological education that correctly understands and loves foreign art and truly understands the value of foreign art, instead of being limited to the circle of their own country's art; this idea has driven Chinese artists to seriously work hard to learn and absorb the art of their friendly countries to serve their own people; (4) Because of the correct leadership of the Chinese government in culture and art and the love for the artists." The last paragraph of the article said: "Being able to see the powerful China learning Khmer art so attentively makes us understand the value of our own art even more. We used to think that no country would learn our art."

The members of the Chinese cultural and artistic delegation also rehearsed the Chinese lotus dance and tea-picking butterfly dance with Princess Norodom Bopha Devi, Prince Norodom Chakrapong, and members of the Royal Palace Dance Troupe with the same excitement. Under the personal guidance of the King and Queen, they learned these two folk dances in a very short period of time, adding a new page to the history of cultural exchange between China and Cambodia.

Indeed, the friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between China and Cambodia did not start today. Looking at the photos and gifts exhibited in Beihai, we will naturally think of the long history of friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between China and Cambodia. Two thousand years ago, China and Cambodia established friendly relations. Historical records tell us that during the Three Kingdoms period in China, Sun Quan of Eastern Wu sent envoys to visit Cambodia (Funan), and Cambodia also sent envoys to visit China, and brought musicians with them. Later, the successive dynasties of Cambodia maintained traditional friendly relations with the Chinese dynasties of Jin, Southern Dynasties, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming. For more than a thousand years, the exchanges of envoys were sometimes quite frequent; for example, during the years of Yuanjia eleven to fifteen (434-438 AD) in the Southern Dynasties Song Dynasty, King Chilipamo of Funan sent envoys to China three times; during the reign of Emperor Liang Wu, who was fond of Buddhism (502-549 AD), King Jayavarman of Funan and his successors sent special envoys to visit and monks to China to help translate Buddhist scriptures more than ten times. During the reign of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1398), Cambodia sent envoys more than ten times. In addition to the envoys sent, during the Kaiyuan and Tianbao periods of Emperor Tang Xuanzong (713-755 AD), the Cambodian prince led 26 followers to China. During the Dali period of Emperor Tang Daizong (766-779 AD), the Cambodian Deputy King Pomie and his wife came to China together. These envoys brought what they considered the most precious gifts. China presented Cambodia with silk, gold, silver, porcelain, etc., and Cambodia presented China with ivory, coral, glass, tortoiseshell and other products, as well as raw rhinoceros horns, white pheasants, elephants, etc. Assuming that our ancestors could take pictures two thousand years ago, imagine if the photos of friendly visits between China and Cambodia in successive dynasties and the gifts given to each other could also be collected for today's exhibition in Beihai, Beihai, although large, I am afraid it would also have the feeling of many books requiring many oxen to carry. Because these gifts are not only exquisite, but also numerous; Cambodia once sent 59 elephants and 60,000 catties of incense to China; China once sent Cambodia 32 pieces of "woven gold silk" and 19,000 pieces of porcelain. The grandeur can be imagined. But how can it be compared with the peaceful and friendly relations developed between the two peoples today on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? The Chinese people deeply expect and firmly believe that the economic and cultural life of the Kingdom of Cambodia and all its people, who have freed themselves from colonial rule, will become increasingly prosperous and prosperous, and that the friendly relations between the two countries will continue to be consolidated and developed.

    中柬两国文化交流史上新的一页
    丁西林
    在去年我国国庆的前夕，柬埔寨王国应中国政府的邀请，派遣了一个以帕花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子为首、由柬埔寨教育部副国务秘书方秉祯阁下领导的柬埔寨文化艺术代表团访问了中国。柬埔寨王国具有高度艺术造诣的艺术家们为中国人民演出的有悠久历史、富有民族风格的柬埔寨古典舞蹈，得到中国人民的热烈欢迎。尤其是帕花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子的艺术天才获得了中国艺术家们一致的称赞。
    为了答谢柬埔寨王国文化艺术代表团那一次的友好访问，中国政府于去年11月初柬埔寨国庆的前夕，派遣了一个中国文化艺术代表团访问了柬埔寨王国。同样地受到柬埔寨人民的热烈欢迎。比较年青的中国代表团团员们为柬埔寨人民演出的中国音乐、舞蹈和戏剧，也荣幸地得到柬埔寨人民的赞赏。毫无疑问，中柬两国这两个文化艺术代表团的相互访问已经在中柬两国悠久的文化交流史上写下了新的一页。
    最近，中国对外文化联络委员会在北海举办了一个展览会，展出了中柬两国文化艺术代表团相互访问的照片和柬埔寨赠送中国文化艺术代表团的部分礼品。让我趁这个机会，把中国文化艺术代表团在柬埔寨的访问和演出经过，作一个简略的报道。
    中国文化艺术代表团在访问柬埔寨王国期间，受到了王国的国王、王后、王室要员、许多政府官员以及柬埔寨的广大人民的热烈欢迎和隆重款待。这充分体现了中柬两国人民之间历史悠久的友好关系。为了要做好接待工作，王国政府成立了一个有各有关部门代表参加的接待委员会，由前访华代表团团长方秉祯亲自领导。11月6日中国代表团的飞机一落到柬埔寨首都金边飞机场，即受到帕花·黛维公主、外交部国务员屋春大臣、新闻部国务员丁东大臣和其他政府高级官员、国家剧院院长、王宫艺术团部分团员，以及上万群众的热烈欢迎。代表团到达金边的时期，适逢柬埔寨每年一度的送水节和柬埔寨王国独立第四周年纪念国庆。为了邀请中国代表团参观送水节的龙舟竞赛，接待委员会特为中国代表团修建了一个浮亭，届时并由帕花·黛维公主和夏卡朋王子相陪。9日上午，我团全体团员被邀参加参观独立节阅兵典礼和群众游行。当天晚上，帕花·黛维公主在西哈努克亲王的桑园别墅举行酒会，欢迎我代表团。11日晚，王宫舞蹈团和国家剧院专为我团联合演出“释迦牟尼的一生”。12日晚，我团在王宫为国王、王后演出。演出结束后，国王向我团正副团长亲授勋章，和全体团员一一握手；公主、王子向正副团长献花；王宫舞蹈团向全体团员献花。代表团离金边出发到外省访问之前，国王接见了代表团全体团员，并举行了一个隆重的宴会招待全体团员。
    中国文化艺术代表团在金边受到了如此隆重的款待；从国王起，态度是那样的亲切；王后的关怀，更是无微不至；这一切使我代表团每个人都感觉到如同住在一个亲戚家中那样的舒适和愉快。
    除了金边之外，代表团访问了磅湛、暹粒、马德望、贡不四个省份，并演出八场。每到一处，代表团也都受到群众的夹道欢迎，和由省政府和当地华侨联合组成的接待委员会的殷勤招待。代表团坐汽车由金边去磅湛时，磅湛副省长到距省市九十余公里的省界迎接；由暹粒去马德望时，暹粒省长和夫人开了自己的汽车把我们送到距省市五十余公里的省界。访问其他省份时，也同样地有省长或省长的代表远途接送。每到一处，除了代表团的演出和省长盛大的招待宴会之外，接待委员会都替代表团安排了参观游览节目，一般也都有省长亲陪。磅湛省长陪代表团参观了据说是亚洲第一个最大的树胶厂和树胶林。树胶林两处的面积占地三万公倾。暹粒省长陪代表团参观了举世闻名的吴哥古迹。在马德望，代理省长陪代表团参观了市内规模最大的饲鸡场；副省长陪代表团参观了市郊有名的佛寺和果园。在贡不省，代表团团员分住在白马海滨几所避暑的别墅中。白马离贡不市二十余公里，背山临海，气候凉爽，风景幽美。
    由贡不省回金边后，为满足市民的要求，代表团增加了三场演出；其中一场是为救济金边市郊火灾灾民的义演。12月6日晚，接待委员会方秉祯主任为代表团饯行；在这最后一次宴会上，代表团以依依惜别的心情，向接待委员会的全体工作人员，并通过他们，向柬埔寨国王、王后、政府和人民，表示了衷心的感谢。
    总起来说，中国文化艺术代表团在柬埔寨停留了一月有余，正式演出十九场，观众六万余人。演出的节目包括京剧、民间舞蹈、民歌独唱、民族乐器演奏四部分，以及从柬埔寨访华代表团初步学会的柬埔寨古典舞蹈和在访柬期间学会的柬埔寨民歌。这些节目的演出，差不多每一个都受到观众的热烈欢迎。各方对我艺术水平的评价也很高。柬埔寨国家通讯社、金边出版的主要报纸人民报、祖国报、友谊报都写了社论和评论，不仅赞美代表团演出的中国艺术，并认为透过艺术的表现，可以看到中国人民在解放后的精神面貌和对柬埔寨人民的真诚友谊。代表团所演的柬埔寨古典舞“百花盛开花园中的仙子们”尽管学到的仅仅是一点皮毛，而且不够熟练，但它特别获得各方面一致的好评。在王宫第一次演出时，国王欣赏地说：“欧洲人也曾有学过柬埔寨舞的，但从没有能学得这样好”。一般的观众初次看见这个节目演出时，常误认为是由柬埔寨演员演出的。为什么柬埔寨观众这样地欣赏这个节目呢？中国代表团在柬埔寨演出了这个节目，对柬埔寨人民产生了什么影响呢？对上面这几个问题，金边的友谊报在一篇短文中作了答复。这篇文章写得非常友好、深刻，很值得我国从事音乐舞蹈的青年工作者的思考；因此我节引该文的一段于后：“不管是艺术家与否，只要看过中国艺术代表团演出的人，都一致赞叹中国的艺员们能如同高棉艺员那样熟练地跳着这个高棉古典舞。为什么中国艺员们能够如此深深地吸取高棉艺术的传统和形态而表现出来呢？（1）由于中棉两国在文化艺术方面曾有着密切交流的长久历史；（2）由于中国女艺员们熟悉了她们自己祖国的艺术，所以当她们学高棉或其他国家艺术的时候，很快就能掌握和吸取一切；（3）由于有着正确认识和热爱外国的艺术及真正懂得外国艺术的价值，而不是限于在自己本国的艺术的圈子里的良好思想教育；这个思想推动了中国艺员们认真地努力学习及吸取他们各友好国家的艺术来为他们自己的人民服务；（4）由于中国政府对文化艺术的正确领导和对艺员们的爱护所致。”文章最后的一段说：“能看到强大的中国这样用心地来学习高棉的艺术，使我们更加了解了自己艺术的价值，从前我们曾以为不会有哪一个国家来学习我们的艺术的。”
    中国文化艺术代表团的团员们也曾怀着同样兴奋的心情辅导帕花·黛维公主、夏卡朋王子和王宫舞蹈团团员们排练了中国的荷花舞和采茶扑蝶舞。在国王、王后亲自指导之下，她们在很短时期内学会了这两个民间舞蹈。为中柬两国文化交流史上添了新的一页。
    诚然，中柬两国的友好来往和文化交流不是从今天开始的。看了在北海展出的照片和礼品，我们很自然地会想起中柬两国友好来往和文化交流的悠久历史。两千年前，中柬两国就建立了友好关系。历史的记载告诉我们，在中国三国时代，东吴孙权就曾派了使者去访问柬埔寨（扶南），柬埔寨也派了使者访问中国，并且还带了乐工同来。以后柬埔寨列代王朝同中国晋、南朝、隋、唐、宋、元、明各王朝一直保持着传统的友好关系。千余年之间，使者来往有时候是相当频繁的；例如南北朝宋元嘉十一至十五年间（公元434—438年），扶南王持黎拔摩曾派使者来中国三次；好佛的梁武帝在位期间（公元502—549年），扶南王闍耶拔摩和他的继承人等曾派遣访问的专使和来中国帮助翻译佛经的僧侣不止十次。明太祖朱元璋在位期间（公元1368—1398年），高棉曾派遣使者十余次。除派遣的使者外，唐元宗开元天宝时（公元713—755年），高棉王子率领随员二十六人来中国。唐代宗大历时（公元766—779年），高棉副王婆弥和他的妻子同来中国。这些使者的来往，都带着自己认为最珍贵的礼品。中国赠送柬埔寨的有绸绫、金银、瓷器等，柬埔寨赠送中国的有象牙、珊瑚、琉璃、玳瑁等制品和生犀、白雉、大象等。假定我们的祖先在两千年前就会照相，设想把列代中柬两国友好访问的照片和相互赠送的礼品也能收集到今天北海的展览会，北海虽大，恐也要有汗牛充栋之感。因为这些礼品不但精，而且多；柬埔寨有一次就送中国大象五十九只，香六万斤；中国有一次送柬埔寨“织金文绮”三十二件，磁器一万九千件。气魄之大，可以想见。但若同现代两国人民之间在五项原则的基础上发展起来的和平友好关系，又岂能同日而语？中国人民深切期望并深信摆脱了殖民主义统治的柬埔寨王国及其全体人民的经济文化生活日益昌盛，日益繁荣，两国的友好关系不断地巩固和发展。
