Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The State Council held its 77th plenary meeting this morning, discussing and adopting the State Council's proposal to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regarding the cessation of issuing national economic construction bonds from 1959 onwards, and allowing provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to issue local economic construction bonds. It also adopted the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Local Economic Construction Bonds (Draft)," which will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

The meeting pointed out that since 1954, the state has issued a certain amount of economic construction bonds each year. With the enthusiastic support of the people nationwide, the issuance plan has been overfulfilled every year. This has played a certain role in raising construction funds and ensuring the smooth progress of the construction plan. This year, an unprecedented upsurge of production and construction has emerged throughout the country. In order to better solve the funding problems needed by various regions in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, and to further implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the unified leadership of the central government, developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously, the State Council believes that appropriate changes need to be made regarding the issuance of bonds. The nationwide bonds are planned to be discontinued from 1959 onwards, and a relatively short-term local bond will be issued by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. This has the following two major benefits: (1) Funds can be raised according to local construction needs and the people's ability to purchase bonds, as a supplementary method of concentrating idle funds to support local construction; (2) Raising funds locally and using funds locally can be more closely integrated with the interests of the local people, and the role of bonds can be brought into fuller play.

The meeting discussed and adopted the report submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Civil Aviation Administration of China regarding China's accession to the "Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air" signed in Warsaw in 1929, and decided to submit it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

The meeting passed the following decisions: to abolish the five counties of Tongxian, Fangshan, Liangxiang, Daxing, and Shunyi in Beijing Municipality, and establish Tongzhou District, Zhoukoudian District, Daxing District, and Shunyi District; to merge Gaoyi and Yuanshi counties in Hebei Province into Gaoyuan County; to abolish Yuci County in Shanxi Province; to abolish the Moridawa Banner and Solun Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and establish the Daur Autonomous Banner and the Ewenki Autonomous Banner; to abolish Dongtou and Yunhe counties in Zhejiang Province; to abolish Lianshan County in Guangdong Province and establish the Lianshan Zhuang and Yao Autonomous County; to establish the city of Karamay in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; to abolish Wensu County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; to establish the cities of Anshun and Duyun in Guizhou Province; to establish Luchun County in Yunnan Province; to abolish Changbai County in Jilin Province and establish the Changbai Korean Autonomous County; to merge Xi County and Daning County in Shanxi Province into Xinning County, and Huo County and Fenxi County into Huofen County. Finally, the meeting passed the list of appointments and removals.

    就地筹集资金就地办事
    建设公债将由地方发行
    国务院通过议案，将提请人大常委会审议决定
    新华社29日讯　国务院在今天上午举行了第七十七次全体会议，讨论和通过了国务院向人大常委会提出的关于从1959年起停止发行国家经济建设公债和允许各省、自治区、直辖市发行地方经济建设公债的议案，并且通过了“中华人民共和国地方经济建设公债条例（草案）”，这个草案将提请人大常委会审议决定。
    会议指出，从1954年开始，国家每年发行一定数量的经济建设公债。在全国人民的热烈支持下，每年都超额完成了发行计划。这对于筹集建设资金，保证建设计划的顺利进行，起了一定的作用。今年在全国范围内出现了一个规模空前的生产建设高潮。为了更好地解决各地在社会主义建设大跃进中所需要的资金问题，进一步贯彻执行在中央统一领导下发展工业和发展农业同时并举、发展中央工业和发展地方工业同时并举、大型企业、中型企业和小型企业同时并举的方针，国务院认为关于公债的发行需要作适当的改变，全国性的公债准备从1959年起停止发行，而由各省、自治区、直辖市发行一种比较短期的地方公债。这样做，有以下两大好处：（一）可以根据当地建设需要和人民购买公债的能力，因地制宜地筹集资金，作为集中闲散资金支援地方建设的一种辅助方法；（二）就地筹集资金就地办事，可以同当地人民的利益更加密切地结合起来，更充分地发挥公债的作用。
    会议讨论和通过了外交部和中国民用航空局提出的关于我国加入1929年在华沙签订的“为统一有关国际空运某些规定的公约”的报告，并且决定提请人大常委会审议决定。
    会议通过了以下决定：撤销北京市的通县、房山、良乡、大兴、顺义五个县和通州市设立通州区、周口店区、大兴区、顺义区；将河北省高邑、元氏两县合并为高元县；撤销山西省榆次县；撤销内蒙古自治区莫力达瓦旗和索伦旗设立达斡尔族自治旗和鄂温克族自治旗；撤销浙江省洞头、云和两县；撤销广东省连山县设立连山僮族瑶族自治县；设立新疆维吾尔自治区克拉玛依市；撤销新疆维吾尔自治区温宿县；设立贵州省安顺市、都匀市；设立云南省绿春县；撤销吉林省长白县设立长白朝鲜族自治县；将山西省隰县、大宁两县合并为隰宁县，霍县、汾西两县合并为霍汾县。最后，会议通过了任免名单。
