    Chief Engineer Always With the Workers
    Yan Chunhong is a chief engineer from the Tianjin Bicycle Factory who started as a worker. In 1952 and 1955, he was twice named an advanced producer in Tianjin. In his daily work, he not only studies diligently himself but also often works with the workers to research problems in production.
    Recently, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory trial-produced a new type of Flying Pigeon brand bicycle. Yan Chunhong worked with the workers to solve the structural and quality problems of the bicycle, completing the product, which was originally planned to be trial-produced in two years, in less than ten days. After appraisal, this new type of Flying Pigeon bicycle has reached the level of the British Raleigh bicycle.
    This is Yan Chunhong inspecting the blueprints of the new product.

    经常同工人在一起的总工艺师
    阎春洪是天津自行车厂工人出身的总工艺师，在1952年和1955年，曾两次被评为天津市先进生产者。在日常工作中，他不仅仅自己苦心钻研，还经常和工人在一起研究生产中的问题。
    天津自行车厂最近试制新型飞鸽牌自行车，阎春洪和工人一道解决了车子的结构和质量问题，使这个原计划在两年内才试制成的产品，不到十天就完成了。经过鉴定，这种新型的飞鸽牌车已经赶上英国凤头牌自行车的水平。
    这是阎春洪在检查新产品的图纸。
