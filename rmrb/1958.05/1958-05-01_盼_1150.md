    Hoping for 1150
  　Yan Chen
    In order to catch up with England in fifteen years, the workers and technicians of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant are working hard to manufacture the 1150 primary rolling mill as soon as possible. The 1150 plays an important role in steel production. Its successful manufacture will demonstrate a new level of industrialization in our country. Recently, the model of the 1150 has been completed and will be transported to Beijing for exhibition.
    In order to let our steel production,
    Be like the Yangtze River, with its rolling waves;
    In order to fully arm as soon as possible
    The steel capital under the Daqing Mountains;
    We anxiously await you,
    Like a drought-stricken land awaits dark clouds,
    1150!
    In the milky yellow design building,
    Pale blue lights burn brightly every night,
    How many designers face blueprints,
    Using collective wisdom and ingenuity.
    Like staff officers on the eve of battle,
    They work tirelessly for you, 1150!
    Let the carpenters' nimble hands,
    First make a 1:2 model,
    Fresh paint shines brightly,
    Also shining with our unparalleled excitement.
    You are the first purple swallow,
    Bringing the good news of spring, 1150!
    "People's Republic of China"
    "Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant,"
    The silver-gray lettering set against a red background,
    Represents the glory and pride of the motherland.
    We have waited for you for decades,
    Today, we will finally make you with our own hands, 1150!
    Your tens of millions of tons of body,
    Like a majestic mountain peak,
    The flexible roller table operates automatically,
    The thick steel ingot becomes as soft as dough.
    Because of you, railways can be as dense as spiderwebs,
    Machines will roar everywhere, 1150!
    In order to catch up with England in fifteen years,
    Showing our high level of technical expertise;
    In order to completely change the face of life,
    To defend the world's lasting peace;
    We stretch out 600 million arms,
    Welcoming your early birth, 1150! (with picture)

    盼1150
  　严辰
    为了十五年赶上英国，富拉尔基重型机器厂的工人技术人员们，正为早日制造出1150初轧机而努力。1150对钢铁产量有重要作用，它的制造成功，将显示我国工业化的新的水平，最近1150的模型已经做好，将运往北京展览。
    为了让我们的钢铁产量，
    像长江大河波涛滚滚；
    为了早日去全副武装
    那大青山下的钢铁都城；
    我们焦急地盼望着你，
    像大旱的日子盼望乌云，
    1150！
    乳黄色的设计大楼里，
    浅蓝的灯光夜夜通明，
    多少设计师面对图纸，
    运用着集体的智慧和匠心。
    像大战前夜的参谋人员，
    他们为你废寝忘食，1150！
    让木工们灵巧的手，
    先做好1∶2的模型，
    新鲜的油漆闪耀着光亮，
    也闪耀着我们无比的兴奋。
    你是第一只紫燕，
    带来了春天的喜讯，1150！
    “中华人民共和国”
    “富拉尔基重机厂”，
    那衬着红底的银灰的字样，
    代表了祖国的光荣和骄矜。
    我们曾等待了你几十年，
    今天，终于要把你亲手制成，1150！
    你千万吨重的身体，
    像一座雄伟的山峰，
    灵活的辊道自动地运转，
    粗大的钢锭变得面团般柔韧。
    由于你，铁道可以密如蛛网，
    机器将会到处轰鸣，1150！
    为了十五年赶上英国，
    显示我们高度的技术水平；
    为了整个改变生活的面貌，
    保卫世界的持久和平；
    我们伸开六万万双手臂，
    迎接你早日诞生，1150！（附图片）
