    Cultivating Red Experts from the Working Class
    Many National Universities Strengthen Work with Old Cadre Classes

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) To cultivate a technical cadre force of their own from the working class, many universities across the country have recently strengthened the work of special classes for old cadres, diligently assisting them in studying science and technology and specialized skills, to truly cultivate them into red experts who are both red and expert.

    Currently, thirteen higher engineering institutes, including Tsinghua University, Tianjin University, and Northeast Institute of Technology, and eight higher medical colleges, including Shanghai First Medical College and Hubei Medical College, have special classes for old cadres. Since 1950, Renmin University of China has held one-year specialized courses in political science, law, and finance to specifically train old cadres in the finance, economics, political science, and law systems. In addition, many amateur colleges have also started special classes for old cadres. Recently, many universities, including Nanjing Institute of Technology, Shandong Institute of Technology, Central China Institute of Technology, Taiyuan Institute of Technology, Nanjing Agricultural College, Northeast Agricultural College, Northwest Agricultural College, Southwest Agricultural College, Nanjing Forestry College, Beijing Medical College, and Shenyang Medical College, have decided to open special classes and refresher courses for old cadres. Many schools with special classes for old cadres are preparing to expand enrollment of old cadres this summer to better and more systematically train them to become experts who are both red and expert.

    In light of the current learning situation and existing problems of students in the old cadre classes, the Party and administrative leaders of many universities have conducted serious research on the teaching work of the old cadre classes and have taken many measures to run the special classes well and effectively help the old cadres improve their learning quality. Some schools have even appointed a vice-principal to personally lead the work of the special classes for old cadres. Many schools, based on the learning characteristics of old cadres, such as high political consciousness, diligent and assiduous study, rich experience in revolutionary struggle, strong ability to understand problems, relatively low level of education, and relatively poor memory, have further strengthened the teaching and tutoring work for old cadres and have specifically formulated teaching plans that are tailored to the situation of old cadres. For example, Tianjin University, Hubei Medical College, and other schools have specifically assigned experienced teachers to teach the old cadre classes and regularly provide them with various types of tutoring. Many schools organize teachers to systematically help old cadre students review their lessons before exams and regularly hold learning seminars for old cadre students to solicit their opinions on teaching and appropriately reduce their social work. Thanks to the emphasis placed on running the special classes for old cadres by the school Party committees and administrative leaders, as well as the diligent study and hard work of the old cadre students themselves, they have made great strides in science and technology and professional knowledge. In recent years, the academic performance of the students in the old cadre classes has improved greatly. Now, many old cadre students have not only mastered basic scientific knowledge such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, but have also learned various professional knowledge. Some of the old cadres studying at the Beijing Mining College and the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology have already begun working on their graduation designs this year. Many old cadre students at Hubei Medical College originally had a very poor foundation in medical knowledge when they entered the school, but now their academic performance has surpassed that of general high school graduate medical students, and many of them have even achieved "excellent" grades.

    培养工人阶级红色专家
    全国许多高等院校加强老干部班工作
    本报讯　为了培养工人阶级自己的技术干部队伍，最近全国各地许多高等学校都加强了老干部特别班的工作，认真帮助老干部学习科学技术和专门业务，以便把他们真正培养成为又红又专的红色专家。
    目前，全国已有清华大学、天津大学、东北工学院等十三所高等工科院校和上海第一医学院、湖北医学院等八所高等医科院校设有老干部特别班。中国人民大学从1950年起就举办了政法和财经专业的一年制专修科，专门培养财经和政法系统的老干部。此外，许多业余高等学校也举办了老干部特别班。最近，南京工学院、山东工学院、华中工学院、太原工学院、南京农学院、东北农学院、西北农学院、西南农学院、南京林学院、北京医学院、沈阳医学院等许多院校又都决定开设老干部特别班和进修班。许多设有老干部特别班的学校正在准备今年暑假扩大招收老干部入学，以更好地有计划地培养老干部成为又红又专的专家。
    针对目前老干部班学员学习的情况和存在的问题，许多高等学校的党政领导都对老干部班的教学工作作了认真的研究，对办好老干部特别班和有效地帮助老干部提高学习质量采取了不少措施，有些学校并指定了一名副校长亲自领导老干部特别班的工作。许多学校都根据老干部的学习特点，如政治觉悟高，学习刻苦钻研，革命斗争经验丰富，理解问题的能力强，文化程度比较低，记忆力比较差等特点，进一步加强了对老干部的教学辅导工作，专门制定了切合老干部情况的教学计划。如天津大学、湖北医学院等校都专门指定了有经验的教师担任老干部班的教学工作，并经常对他们进行各种辅导。许多学校在考试前都组织了教师系统地帮助老干部学员复习功课，并定期召开老干部学员的学习座谈会，征求他们对教学的意见，并适当减轻了他们的社会工作。由于学校党委和行政领导上对办好老干部特别班的重视，以及老干部学员自己的刻苦钻研，向科学技术和专业知识大进军，几年来，老干部班的学员们学习成绩很大。现在不少老干部学员不仅掌握了数学、物理、化学等基础科学知识，并且学会了各种专业知识。在北京矿业学院和北京钢铁工业学院学习的老干部，有的今年已经开始在作毕业设计。湖北医学院的许多老干部学员入学时原来医学基础知识很差，可是现在他们的学习成绩已经超过了一般高中毕业的医科学生，其中许多学员还获得了“优良”的成绩。
