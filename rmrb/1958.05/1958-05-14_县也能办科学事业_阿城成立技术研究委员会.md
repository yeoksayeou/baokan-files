Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 13th. Acheng County in Heilongjiang Province has set a precedent in developing scientific research at the county level by establishing a Technical Research Committee. This technical committee is composed of more than 20 scientific and technical personnel from factories, schools, and health departments throughout the county. It has three subgroups: machinery, chemical fertilizers, and electrical engineering. These groups are conducting research on the trial manufacture and reform of agricultural machinery, the production of chemical fertilizers, and biogas power generation, to promote and support the great leap forward in agricultural production.

	Since its establishment in early April, the Technical Research Committee has accomplished a great deal in just over a month. The machinery research group has trial-manufactured and imitated more than ten kinds of new agricultural implements, such as wind turbines, hydro-generators, feed crushers, rice transplanters, threshers, and bean harvesters. It is currently researching new-style tools such as pulleys and tampers for agricultural water conservancy construction. The chemical fertilizer group has successfully researched and developed phosphorus-nitrogen bacteria fertilizer and has begun small-scale production. The electrical research group's research on biogas power generation has also been basically successful.

	To ensure that these new products are put into production as soon as possible, Acheng County is organizing technical collaboration and production collaboration between factories to help arrange preparatory work before production. At the same time, to facilitate farmers' rapid mastery of the operation techniques of the new agricultural implements, short-term training classes have been established to train agricultural technical personnel to teach in rural areas.

　　县也能办科学事业
　　阿城成立技术研究委员会
    新华社哈尔滨13日电　黑龙江省阿城县在发展县一级的科学研究工作上开了先例，成立了技术研究委员会。这个技术委员会是吸收全县的工厂、学校和卫生部门的二十多名科学、技术人员参加组成的，下设机械、化学肥料和电气等三个小组，分别进行农业的机械试制和改革、化学肥料的生产以及沼气发电等项研究工作，来促进和支援农业生产大跃进。
    技术研究委员会从4月初成立到现在一个多月来已作了不少工作。机械研究小组已试制和仿制了风动机、水轮发电机和饲料粉碎机、水稻插秧机、脱谷机、割豆机等十余种新式农具；现在正为农业水利化施工研究滑车、打夯机等新式工具。化学肥料组已研究成功了磷氮菌肥料，并已开始小规模生产。电气研究组研究沼气发电也已基本成功。
    为使这些新产品及早投入生产，阿城县正在组织各厂间的技术协作和生产协作，帮助安排生产前的准备工作。同时，为了便于农民很快掌握新农具的操作技术，还成立了短期训练班，培养农业技术人材到农村传授。
