    National Painting Exhibition
    The fourth exhibition of the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association has opened at the Painting Boat Studio in Beihai Park.

    Over 320 works are on display. Many works have broken through the old constraints in terms of content, reflecting the new people and new things of socialism. This is the result of the competition among more than 200 national painters in the capital, under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," developing different styles, different genres, and different schools of painting.

    国画展览会
    北京中国画研究会第四届展览会，已在北海公园画舫斋展出。
    展出的作品共三百二十余件。不少作品在内容上突破了旧有的束缚，反映了社会主义的新人新事。这是首都二百余位国画家在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的文艺方针指导下，开展不同的风格、不同体裁和不同画派的竞赛的结果。（殷伯衡）
