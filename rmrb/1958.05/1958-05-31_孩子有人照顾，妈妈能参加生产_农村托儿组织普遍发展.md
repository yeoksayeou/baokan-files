Xinhua News Agency report: Driven by the current great leap forward in agricultural production, rural childcare organizations are developing rapidly in various regions. According to statistics from 349 counties in Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Guizhou and the suburban areas of Beijing, these regions have established more than 659,000 childcare organizations of various types, with more than 6.4 million children in care, enabling millions of women who were previously unable to work due to the burden of childcare to join in production. The development of childcare organizations in Henan, Hunan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang provinces has been the fastest, with basically every commune and team having a childcare organization, more than 80% of children enrolled, and all women with the ability to work now participating in production.

After the establishment of these childcare organizations, children's health and safety have been better guaranteed. Since the beginning of this year, the incidence of injuries and deaths among children due to lack of care has been significantly reduced in various regions.

In establishing childcare organizations, all regions have adhered to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, and have adopted various methods such as fixed, temporary, mobile, and nighttime nurseries, childcare groups, and kindergartens, as well as mutual assistance among relatives and neighbors and individual foster care, based on the needs of production and the masses. As for the location of nurseries, groups, and kindergartens, some are in houses vacated by agricultural cooperatives and the masses, while others are simple sheds built next to the fields, ensuring that wherever mothers are producing, childcare organizations are there too. The equipment for childcare organizations and the children's toys are mostly provided and manufactured by the masses themselves.

    孩子有人照顾，妈妈能参加生产
    农村托儿组织普遍发展
    据新华社讯　在当前农业生产大跃进的推动下，各地农村托儿组织正在迅速发展。据河北、山西、江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、广东、黑龙江、贵州等省三百四十九个县和北京市郊区的统计，这些地区已建立了各种托儿组织六十五万九千多处，受托的孩子有六百四十万多个，使几百万有孩子拖累而不能出工的妇女投入了生产。河南、湖南、河北、黑龙江四省的托儿组织发展最快，已经基本上做到社社队队有托儿组织，80％以上的孩子入托，有劳动能力的妇女已全部出勤。
    这些托儿组织建立后，孩子的健康和安全更有了保障。今年以来，各地因孩子无人照管而发生伤亡的现象已显著减少。
    各地建立托儿组织都本着勤俭办一切事业的精神，根据生产和群众的需要，采用固定、临时、流动、夜间等形式的托儿所、托儿组和幼儿园，以及亲邻相帮、个别寄托等多种办法。托儿所、组和幼儿园的场所，有的由农业社和群众自行腾出一部分房子，有的就在田地旁边搭个窝棚，做到妈妈在那里生产，托儿组织就到那里。托儿组织的设备和孩子的玩具大都由群众自备和制造。
