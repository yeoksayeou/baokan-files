　　A Good Girl at the Train Station

　　On the evening of May 3rd, I witnessed a moving event at Binjiang Railway Station. In the waiting room, there was a blind passenger loudly calling for the child who was supposed to guide him, but after calling several times, no one answered. He then felt his way along the wall as he walked and called out. At that moment, a young female service worker at the station was sweeping the floor. When she heard the blind man calling, she went over and asked, "Do you need to buy a ticket? I'll buy it for you." The blind man replied, "No, I'm looking for the child to lead me to the restroom." Seeing that he was having difficulty walking, the female service worker immediately led him to the restroom and, after he came out, took him back to his original seat. After asking him where he was going, the female service worker bought him two tickets and brought them back to him. The blind man was so grateful that he repeatedly thanked her. The passengers at the station all praised this female service worker as a truly good girl.

　　车站上的好姑娘
    5月3日晚，我在滨江车站看到一件动人的事。候车室里有个双目失明的旅客，在大声叫唤给他领路的孩子，喊了几声没人答应，他就抚着墙一边走一边喊。这时，车站的一位青年女服务员正在扫地，她听见这位盲人叫喊，就走上前来问道：“你要买车票吗？我给你买去。”盲人回答说：“不是，我找孩子领我上厕所。”这个女服务员看他走路很不方便，立刻把他领到厕所，等他出来以后，又把他送到原来的座位上。这个女服务员问明他的去处后，又给他买了两张车票送回来。这个盲人感激得连声道谢。车站上的旅客都赞扬这个女服务员真是个好姑娘。
