Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: The National Agricultural Implement Exhibition officially opened at 9:00 AM on May 5th. In front of the exhibition hall, located east of the Agricultural Mechanization Institute in the northern suburbs of Beijing, red flags fluttered, welcoming a steady stream of visitors.

This morning, Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Chen Zhengran, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, visited the exhibition accompanied by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture.

On the reflecting screen in front of the General Hall, visitors first saw a large picture of Chairman Mao visiting Hangzhou and personally using a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, illustrating that China's technological revolution in agriculture has begun comprehensively under the leadership of the Party. Large characters on both sides of the picture read: "Implement reform blossoms everywhere; mass wisdom is infinite." Behind the General Hall's plaza was a sea of various agricultural implements and machinery. On display here are mainly agricultural implements, tools, and simple machinery for cultivation, irrigation, transportation, and construction, which have been created, reformed, and refitted by the masses themselves during the current national agricultural implement reform movement. Also on display are new agricultural implements and machinery created for farmers by urban workers and handicraft workers in the past six months, supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. Their common characteristics are that they are invented and created by the broad masses of workers and peasants using their own hands and brains, are made from local materials, are efficient, low-cost, simple, and practical. They adapt to the different cultivation requirements of various regions, are able to improve the quality of cultivation, accelerate the speed of construction, promote the great leap forward in agricultural production, and realize the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. They are a concentrated manifestation of the budding mass wisdom.

The General Hall uses charts and diagrams to introduce ancient Chinese agricultural implements and the current development of mechanized farming in China, but mainly focuses on introducing various water lifting tools, transportation tools, agricultural implements for dry land, paddy fields, and mountains, various machinery, and tractors created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward.

What most excited the audience were the Farmland Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Hall, the Rural Transportation Tool Hall, and the Cultivation Machinery Hall. These three halls displayed the most creations of the masses. Around a newly built large pool, there were about a hundred kinds of water lifting tools powered by manpower, animal power, power, and wind power. It was a chorus of pumping sounds, with various water lifting tools demonstrating their effectiveness. Various construction tools for water conservancy projects were also diverse, including various earth-moving wooden rails, cableways, cranes, conveyor belts, transmission buckets, automatic loading and unloading earth-moving devices, lever tamping machines, and so on. The Cultivation Hall also had various double-wheeled, double-furrow plows that had been modified to reduce weight, deep plows, mountain bidirectional plows, and the high-quality, high-efficiency August 1st tractor manufactured in Jiangxi, as well as a set of mechanized farming implements for paddy fields.

The Agricultural and Sideline Product Processing Machinery Hall, Economic Crop Machinery Hall, Plant Protection Machinery Hall, Agricultural Fixed Power Machinery Hall, Animal Husbandry Machinery Hall, and Forestry Machinery Hall all displayed machinery modified and refitted by workers and peasants.

The exhibition hall also displayed a low-water level hydroelectric power station in the plains near Tianjin, a biogas digester, and solar water heaters manufactured in Shanghai and Gansu. The power station was not a model but was generating electricity and lighting lamps. Some visitors even drank boiled water from the solar water heater.

During their visit, Tan Zhenlin, Bo Yibo, Chen Zhengran, and other comrades praised the various water lifting tools created by the masses. They tried many of the foot-operated and hand-cranked water wheels and believed that through this exhibition, these self-made water lifting tools of the masses could be quickly promoted to solve the major problem of current farmland irrigation. They made detailed inquiries and watched demonstrations of the underground tile pipe irrigation created by the Dongduozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, various wooden rails, the crane automatic unloading device in Anhui Province, and the earth-moving conveyor belt in Zhejiang Province. They highly praised the hand-cranked and power-driven automatic soil dumping device created by He Ting, a member of the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Sunzhuang Township, Tanghe County, Henan Province. This soil dumping device automatically moves back and forth and automatically dumps soil at a high speed, making it the best of various earth-moving cranes. They inquired in detail about the process of invention and creation from the inventor He Ting, warmly shook his hand to congratulate him, and encouraged him to continue improving it.

Also visiting today were leading comrades and cadres from the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Forestry, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Second Ministry of Commerce, teachers and students from Beijing municipal organs and various universities, scientific and technical personnel from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences and related agricultural and agricultural machinery research institutes, visitors from Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang and other provinces, the Beijing press, and some foreign guests.

    农业技术革命全面进军
    全国农具展览会上群众智慧大放异彩
    新华社5日讯　5日上午九时，全国农具展览会正式开幕。在北京市北郊农业机械化学院的东面，展览馆门前红旗飘扬，欢迎着源源不断的观众。
    今天上午，中共中央书记处书记谭震林、国务院副总理薄一波、中共中央农村工作部副部长陈正人，在农业部部长廖鲁言陪同下，参观了展览会。
    在综合馆前面的照壁上，人们首先看到毛主席在杭州市参观并亲自扶双轮双铧犁耕地的大幅图片，说明我国农业的技术革命，在党的领导下全面开始了。图片两旁的大字写着：“工具改革，遍地开花；群众智慧，无穷无尽”。综合馆后面的广场上，便是一片多种多样的农具和农业机械的海洋。这里陈列的主要是当前全国农具改革运动中群众自己创造、改造、改装的耕作、排灌、运输、施工等方面的农具、工具和简单的机械。也陈列着各地城市工人、手工业工人为支援农业生产大跃进，在最近半年间为农民创造的新式农具和机械。它们共同的特点是广大工农群众自己动手动脑筋发明创造的，是就地取材就地制造的，是效率高成本低而又简便适用的，它们适应各地区不同的耕作要求，是能够提高耕作质量、加快施工速度、促进农业生产大跃进和提前实现农业发展纲要的。它们是初露锋芒的群众智慧的一次集中表现。
    综合馆以图表介绍了我国古代的农具，介绍了我国当前的机械耕作发展情况，而主要的是集中介绍大跃进中群众创造的各种提水工具，运输工具，旱地、水田和山地的农具，各种机械和拖拉机。
    最使观众感到兴奋的是农田灌溉排水机具馆、农村运输工具馆和耕作机具馆。这三馆陈列的群众创造的东西最多。一个新建的大水池周围，人力、畜力、动力、风力的各式各样的提水工具达百种左右，这里是一片抽水声，各种提水工具都在施展自己的效力。兴修水利工程的各种施工工具也是多种多样的，有各种运土木轨、天线、吊车、传送带、传送斗、自动装卸运土器、杠杆打夯车等等。耕作馆中还有各种改装因而减轻了的双轮双铧犁、有深耕犁、有山地双向犁和江西制造的质量好效率高的八一拖拉机和一套水田的机耕农具。
    其他农产品副业加工机具馆、经济作物机具馆、植物保护机具馆、农用固定动力机械馆、畜牧机械馆、林业机械馆都陈列了工农群众改制改装的机具。
    展览馆还陈列着天津附近的平原低水位水力发电站，沼气发生池、上海和甘肃制造的太阳能烧水器等等。发电站不是模型，而是就发着电，点着灯。有的观众还喝到了太阳能烧水器烧的开水。
    谭震林、薄一波、陈正人等同志在参观中，对群众创造的各种提水工具赞声不绝。很多脚踏的、手摇的水车他们都试了一试，认为通过这次展览，这些群众自造的提水工具迅速推广，就可解决当前农田灌溉的大问题。他们对河南省偃师县东夺庄农业社创造的地下瓦管灌溉、各种木轨、安徽省的吊车自动卸土器、浙江省的运土传送带等等都详细地作了询问，看了表演。他们对河南省唐河县孙庄乡红星农业社社员贺亭创造的手摇、动力两用的自动倒土器极为称赞。这种倒土器自动来回、自动倒土速度很高，是各种运土吊车中最好的一种。他们详细地向发明者贺亭询问了发明创造的过程，并热烈地和他握手道贺，鼓励他继续改进。
    今天参观的还有国家经济委员会、农业部、农垦部、水利电力部、林业部、第一机械工业部、第二商业部等部的首长和干部，北京市机关、各高等院校的师生，农业科学院和有关农业、农业机械研究所的科学技术人员，河北、山东、陕西、辽宁、黑龙江等省的参观人员，北京新闻界和一些外宾。
