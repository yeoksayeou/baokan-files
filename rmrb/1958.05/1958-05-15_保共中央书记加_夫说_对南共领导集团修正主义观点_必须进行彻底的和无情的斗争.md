Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 14th. Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau Member and Secretary Gavrov said, "A thorough and ruthless struggle should be waged against the modern revisionism clearly manifested in the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, because this revisionism is the mortal enemy and main danger of the current communist movement." Gavrov made the above remarks on May 11th at the unveiling ceremony of a revolutionary martyr monument in Silistra, northeastern Bulgaria.

Gavrov pointed out that in the current international situation, "there is only one way to defend peace, and that is the greatest unity of the socialist camp—the only real force capable of stopping the war maniacs—the greatest unity of the ranks of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, as well as all progressive and peace-loving forces in the world. Therefore, any practice that goes against this cannot be regarded as anything other than a direct betrayal of the cause of peace. Any such action will only benefit the imperialists in realizing their sinister intentions. If those who claim to be communists make such attempts, then this is an open betrayal of the cause of communism. The actions of the Yugoslav communist leadership group cannot be seen as anything else. They stubbornly try to revise the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the unity of the communist and workers' movements.

Gavrov also said, "Based on the historical experience of the Soviet Union, our own experience, and the experience of other socialist countries, we know very well how important the dictatorship of the proletariat is for the success of socialist construction and communist construction; and how important the Communist Party plays as the leader and organizer of the working class and the working masses." Gavrov went on to point out that therefore, the Bulgarian communists firmly oppose the Yugoslav revisionists' claims that the state begins to wither away during the transition from capitalism to socialism and that they oppose the leading role of the Communist Party. Gavrov said, "When they say this, they are actually trying to disarm the people in the face of imperialist plunderers, imperialist spies in socialist countries, and the remnants of the overthrown bourgeoisie. In the future, we will continue to do everything possible to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the Communist Party, and strengthen our people's democratic country."

Gavrov also pointed out that the Bulgarian communists firmly fight back against any attempt to slander the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's leading role in the socialist camp. He said, "The Soviet Union is pursuing a true Leninist foreign policy. Its relations with other socialist countries are completely fraternal and equal. Thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, socialist countries, including our country, are advancing rapidly. This is not only seen by the people of socialist countries, but also by the working masses and oppressed masses all over the world. This is also seen by the Yugoslav people. Only those who are unwilling to see this cannot see it. Attempts to shake the unity of the socialist camp and divide socialist countries only benefit the imperialists. Therefore, we demand that all efforts be made to strengthen the unity and power of the socialist camp, and to strengthen the unity of the international communist movement and the workers' movement on the basis of proletarian internationalism. This is the attitude of the Bulgarian communists, who will never give in to or compromise with opportunism and revisionism in ideology."

　　保共中央书记加?夫说
    对南共领导集团修正主义观点
    必须进行彻底的和无情的斗争
    新华社索非亚14日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员、书记处书记加?夫说：“应该同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会明显表现出来的现代修正主义进行彻底的、无情的斗争，因为这种修正主义是现今共产主义运动的死敌和主要的危险。”以上的话是加?夫11日在保加利亚东北部的西利斯特拉市举行的革命烈士纪念碑揭幕典礼上讲的。
    加?夫指出，在目前的国际形势下，“要保卫和平只有一条道路，这就是社会主义阵营——能够制止战争狂人的唯一现实的力量——的最大的团结，国际共产主义运动和工人运动以及世界上一切进步和爱好和平的力量的队伍的最大的团结。因此，对于任何背道而驰的作法，我们不能看作别的，而只能看作是直接背叛和平事业的作法。任何这样的行动都只会有利于帝国主义者实现他们的罪恶意图。如果自命为共产党人的人作这种尝试，那末这就是公开背叛共产主义事业。南共领导集团的行为不能看成是别的，他们十分顽固地力图修正马克思列宁主义学说的基本原则，破坏社会主义阵营的团结，破坏共产主义运动和工人运动的团结。
    加?夫还说：“根据苏联的历史经验，根据我们自己的经验和其他社会主义国家的经验，我们很清楚地知道，无产阶级专政对于社会主义建设和共产主义建设的成功具有多么巨大的意义；共产党作为工人阶级和劳动群众的领导者和组织者起着多么巨大的作用。”加?夫接着指出，因此，保加利亚共产党人坚决反对南斯拉夫修正主义者鼓吹的国家在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时候就开始消亡和反对共产党的领导作用的论点。加?夫说：“他们这样说，实际上是想叫人民在帝国主义掠夺者、在社会主义国家中的帝国主义特务和被打倒的资产阶级残余面前解除武装。今后，我们将继续尽一切努力来加强无产阶级专政，加强共产党，加强我们的人民民主国家”。
    加?夫还指出，保加利亚共产党人坚决反击任何污蔑苏联和苏联在社会主义阵营中的领导作用的企图。他说：“苏联执行的是真正的列宁主义的外交政策。它同其他社会主义国家之间的关系，完全是兄弟和平等的关系。由于苏联的无私援助，社会主义国家，其中包括我国，正在迅速地前进。这一切不仅社会主义国家的人民看到，就是全世界劳动群众和被压迫群众也都看得到。这是南斯拉夫人民也看到的。只有那些不愿意看到这一点的人才看不到。动摇社会主义阵营的团结和分裂社会主义国家的尝试只是对帝国主义者有利。因此，我们要求尽一切努力，来加强社会主义阵营的团结和威力，以无产阶级国际主义为基础来加强国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致。这就是保加利亚共产党人的态度，他们在思想上决不向机会主义和修正主义让步和妥协”。
