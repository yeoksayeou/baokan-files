A Salute to the Valiant People of Lebanon

The whole world is watching Lebanon. There, the heroic struggle of patriotic people against imperialism and its agents has persisted for three weeks. Currently, the insurgent people have occupied important cities such as Tripoli, Halba, Mina, and Baalbek, and control the entire northern part of Lebanon, as well as large areas in the central and southern regions. Despite the pro-Western Chamoun government using planes, artillery, and tanks supplied by imperialism to launch massive attacks on the insurgent people, despite the United States directing Jordanian and Iraqi troops to illegally enter Beirut to assist the Lebanese government, and despite the United States and Britain themselves displaying their Mediterranean fleets to demonstrate against the Lebanese people, the valiant Lebanese people have not been intimidated. They are continuing to fight, holding high the banner of patriotism.

The Lebanese people's patriotic struggle was triggered by the assassination of Matni, the director of the "Telegraph" newspaper. However, the Matni incident was only a fuse. In Lebanon, the contradictions between imperialism and its agents and the Lebanese people have long been very sharp, and it was bound to develop into open conflict. The Lebanese people's slogan of "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine" and the burning of some American aggressive institutions in Lebanon are by no means accidental. For many years, the vast majority of the Lebanese people have personally felt that American aggression, especially the "Eisenhower Doctrine," has dragged Lebanon into an abyss of disaster. This situation cannot but sadden every Lebanese patriot, and the anger that has accumulated in their hearts for a long time has finally erupted. Precisely because of this, in this patriotic struggle, the main opposition parties in Lebanon were able to unite unanimously, and people from all walks of life in Lebanon were able to unite widely, launching a nationwide and vigorous battle against imperialism and its agents.

Lebanon has a population of only 1.5 million and is under the control of several imperialist powers. Imperialism uses various ropes of military, political, and economic power, and strengthens the enslavement of the Lebanese people through its long-cultivated agents in Lebanon. Therefore, imperialist spokesmen have always called Lebanon a "Western fortress" in the Middle East. Last spring, the United States forced Lebanon to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine," intending to use this "Western fortress" to implement its colonial aggression plan in other Arab countries. However, in this "Western fortress," in this country with a population of only 1.5 million, an anti-imperialist struggle that has shaken the world has erupted. This is an event of profound significance. It most vividly proves that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has lost all popular support in the Middle East, and the prestige of American imperialism has plummeted. No wonder the "New York Times" exclaimed that the situation in Lebanon was "distressing"!

From the very beginning of the Lebanese people's patriotic struggle, the United States has continuously interfered in Lebanon's internal affairs. The U.S. fleet has sailed to the waters near Lebanon. Recently, the United States has also instigated the Lebanese authorities to submit a so-called "accusation" to the Security Council, slandering the United Arab Republic, in an attempt to create an excuse for further intervention. Dulles and Eisenhower have also repeatedly stated that the United States has the "right" to take military action against Lebanon using the "Eisenhower Doctrine." At the same time, the United States is also carrying out various political conspiracies in Lebanon, attempting to divide the various opposition parties in Lebanon and paralyze the Lebanese people's fighting spirit, in order to maintain the pro-Western regime headed by President Chamoun, or to achieve this goal by changing the medicine but not the prescription.

The United States' interference and provocation in Lebanon is not only an attempt to salvage the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and suppress the national independence movement, but also an attempt to take the opportunity to create tension in the Near and Middle East. Driven by the economic crisis, some reactionary groups in the United States are trying to find a way out by launching wars. Recently, the discussion by American military authorities about "limited wars" has become increasingly public. Their so-called "limited war" is actually to take action against a certain country in a certain region. The United States' conspiracy of intervention activities in Lebanon has constituted a serious threat to the cause of peace. The United States' attempt to use the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to interfere in Lebanon is completely illegal. If the United States dares to carry out military intervention, it must bear all the guilt for launching aggression and undermining peace.

The Lebanese people are not only fighting to defend their national independence, but also to defend the cause of peace. We, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world stand with the heroic Lebanese people. If imperialism provokes the Lebanese people, it will inevitably be opposed by the peace-loving people of the world. Imperialism is a paper tiger, and the Lebanese people have once again proved this truth with their heroic struggle. We firmly believe that the Lebanese people will become stronger and stronger in their just struggle against imperialism and for the defense of national independence, and will achieve a glorious victory.

### 向英勇的黎巴嫩人民致敬

    向英勇的黎巴嫩人民致敬
    全世界都在注视着黎巴嫩。在那里，爱国人民反对帝国主义及其代理人的英勇斗争已经坚持三个星期了。目前起义人民已经占据了的黎波里、哈勒巴、米纳和巴尔贝克等重要城市，控制了黎巴嫩的整个北部以及中部和南部的大片地区。尽管亲西方的夏蒙政府使用帝国主义供给的飞机、大炮、坦克，向起义人民大举进攻，尽管美国指使约旦和伊拉克部队非法开往贝鲁特援助黎巴嫩政府，尽管美国和英国自己也摆出了它们的地中海舰队向黎巴嫩人民示威，但是，英勇的黎巴嫩人民并没有被吓倒，他们正在高举着爱国主义的旗帜继续战斗。
    黎巴嫩人民这次的爱国斗争，是由“电讯报”社长马特尼被害的事件所引起的。然而，马特尼事件只是一个导火线。在黎巴嫩，帝国主义及其代理人同黎巴嫩人民之间的矛盾，早已十分尖锐，它必然要发展为公开的冲突。黎巴嫩人民高呼“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”的口号，烧毁了美国在黎巴嫩的一些侵略机构，这决不是偶然的。多年以来，黎巴嫩的广大人民都亲身感觉到，美国的侵略活动，特别是“艾森豪威尔主义”，已经把黎巴嫩拖向灾难的深渊。这种情况不能不使每一个黎巴嫩的爱国人民感到痛心，长期积压在他们心头的愤怒终于爆发出来了。正是因为这样，在这次爱国主义斗争中，黎巴嫩的主要反对党能够一致地联合起来，黎巴嫩各阶层人民能够广泛地团结起来，向帝国主义及其代理人展开了全国规模的声势浩大的战斗。
    黎巴嫩只有一百五十万人口，并且处于几个帝国主义的控制之下。帝国主义利用军事、政治和经济的种种绳索，并且通过自己在黎巴嫩长期培植的代理人，加强对黎巴嫩人民的奴役。所以，帝国主义的代言人一向把黎巴嫩叫做中东的一个“西方堡垒”。去年春天，美国强迫黎巴嫩接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，也就是想利用这个“西方堡垒”，把它的殖民侵略计划推行到其他的阿拉伯国家去。但是，就在这个“西方堡垒”里，就在这个只有一百五十万人口的国家里，爆发了震动全世界的反帝国主义的斗争。这是一个具有深刻意义的事件。它最生动地证明了“艾森豪威尔主义”在中东已经丧尽人心，美帝国主义的威风已经一落千丈。无怪乎“纽约时报”大叫黎巴嫩局势是“令人苦恼的”！
    美国从黎巴嫩人民展开爱国斗争的一开始，就不断地对黎巴嫩内政进行干涉。美国舰队已经开到黎巴嫩附近海面。最近，美国又策动黎巴嫩当局向安理会提出了污蔑阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓“控诉”，企图制造进一步干涉的借口。杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔并且一再声称，美国有“权”利用“艾森豪威尔主义”对黎巴嫩采取军事行动。同时，美国也在黎巴嫩进行种种政治阴谋，企图分化黎巴嫩的各反对党，麻痹黎巴嫩人民的斗争情绪，以便维持以夏蒙总统为首的亲西方政权，或者用换汤不换药的办法来达到这个目的。
    美国对黎巴嫩的干涉和挑衅，不仅是企图挽救“艾森豪威尔主义”，镇压民族独立运动，而且企图乘机在中近东制造紧张局势。由于经济危机的逼迫，美国某些反动集团正想用发动战争的办法谋求出路。近来美国军事当局关于“有限战争”的议论是越来越公开了。他们所谓的“有限战争”实际上就是在某一个地区，向某一个国家开刀。美国对黎巴嫩的干涉活动阴谋，已经构成了对于和平事业的严重威胁。美国想利用“艾森豪威尔主义”来干涉黎巴嫩，是完全非法的。如果美国胆敢进行军事干涉，那它必须承担发动侵略、破坏和平的全部罪责。
    黎巴嫩人民不但是为了保卫自己民族独立而战斗，而且也是为了保卫和平事业而战斗。我们中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民一道，是站在英勇的黎巴嫩人民一边的。帝国主义如果向黎巴嫩人民挑衅，那就必然要遭到全世界和平人民的反对。帝国主义是纸老虎，黎巴嫩人民以他们的英勇斗争又一次证明了这个真理。我们深深相信，黎巴嫩人民在他们反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立的正义斗争中，将会越战越强，并且得到光辉的胜利。
