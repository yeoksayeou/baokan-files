Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The first farmer-run film projection teams in Chinese history have recently been established in the Wanhuzhijia Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province, and the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Chiyangkou Township and the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jing'an Township, Changli County.

　　These agricultural cooperative-run film projection teams were established with the assistance of the government's cultural departments. Funding is self-raised from the public welfare fund by one or several cooperatives jointly, and projection personnel are temporarily allocated with the assistance of the government's cultural departments. These projection teams first meet the needs of the members of their own village and cooperative, while also taking into account the needs of audiences in other townships and cooperatives, striving to establish projection points in every village and deliver movies to their doorsteps. These projection teams all implement enterprise management, and currently adopt a unified charging method of "half a day's (or one day's) labor for a year of movie viewing" (that is, all cooperative members work for half a day or a day without receiving labor remuneration, and the cooperative uses this money as the members' movie viewing expenses for the year).

　　Currently, members are welcoming the birth of their own film teams by carrying out crash anti-drought measures and completing spring planting tasks ahead of schedule. Farmers are very welcoming of the work of the projection teams. They say: "Movies are delivered to our homes, happy flowers bloom in the countryside, we have sufficient enthusiasm for building water conservancy, and we will realize high agricultural production." When the people-run film projection teams were established, these cooperatives all held celebrations. Hong Wenzhen, an old woman from the Shuguang Cooperative, watched the color film "Blessing" at the celebration and said with tears in her eyes: "Before liberation, we lived a hard life like Xianglin Sao. Today's happy life is the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us on the road of collectivization."

　　电影送到了农家门上
    沙河农民自办电影放映队
    据新华社13日讯　中国历史上第一批农民自办的电影放映队，最近先后在河北省沙河县万户之家农业社和昌黎县赤洋口乡红星农业社、靖安乡曙光农业社里诞生了。
    这几个由农业社办的电影放映队是在政府文化主管部门协助下建立起来的。经费由一个社或几个社联合在公益金中自筹，放映人员暂时由政府文化主管部门协助调配。这些放映队首先满足本村本社社员的要求，同时也照顾其他乡、社观众的需要，争取在村村建立放映点，把电影送上门去。这些放映队都实行企业管理，目前采取“劳动半天（或一天），看电影一年”的统一收费办法（即全体社员劳动一天或半天，不领劳动报酬，社里将这笔钱作为社员们一年看电影的经费）。
    目前社员们正以突击抗旱和提前完成春播任务来迎接自己电影队的诞生，农民对放映队的工作十分欢迎。他们说：“电影送到咱们家，农村开放幸福花，兴修水利干劲足，实现农业高产化”。民办电影队成立时，这几个社都开了庆祝会，曙光社社员洪文珍老大娘在庆祝会上看了彩色片“祝福”以后感动得流着眼泪说：“解放前咱就是过着祥林嫂那样的苦日子，今天的幸福生活是共产党和毛主席领导咱们走合作化道路得来的”。
