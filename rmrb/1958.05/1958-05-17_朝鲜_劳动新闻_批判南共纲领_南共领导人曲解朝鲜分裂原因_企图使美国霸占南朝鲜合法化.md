Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 15th: The "Rodong Sinmun" today published an article criticizing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, entitled: "Against Modern Revisionism."

　　The article first pointed out that modern revisionism is concentratedly manifested in the draft program adopted at the recent Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the speeches made by the LCY leaders at the meeting. The article pointed out that the LCY leaders described the criticism of them by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the communist and workers' parties of various countries as "interference in internal affairs" and stubbornly insisted on their revisionist views.

　　The article said that the "creative" theories put forward by the LCY leaders while denigrating the revolutionary activities of Marxist-Leninist parties as "dogmatism" are by no means new. In essence, it is nothing more than a rehash of the anti-Marxist theories of Bernstein, Kautsky, and other revisionists of the Second International.

　　The article refuted the absurd views on socialist revolution put forward in the draft program of the LCY. The article pointed out that the draft program does not recognize the class nature of bourgeois states. According to the draft program, it seems that the process of transition from capitalism to socialism can also be completed through state capitalism; it seems that the bourgeois state, which oppresses and exploits the working people, will abandon its class position and automatically carry out socialist transformation for the liberation of the working people. The draft program of the LCY believes that it is possible to peacefully enter socialism through state capitalism and the gradual growth of so-called "socialist factors." Obviously, this is no different from Bernstein's theory of the "peaceful growth" of socialism.

　　The article refuted the attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat and democratic centralism in the draft program of the LCY. The article said that if the principles of democratic centralism and the function of suppressing counter-revolutionaries are removed from the dictatorship of the proletariat, it would be tantamount to abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The claim of the drafters of the LCY program is essentially a denial of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The article emphasized that the Korean people, who have been engaged in fierce class struggle and socialist construction in the face of U.S. imperialism for more than ten years, can never agree with the view of the drafters of the LCY program that bureaucracy is more dangerous than class enemies.

　　The article said that the most fundamental issue in the dictatorship of the proletariat is the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party. However, the Yugoslav revisionists do not believe that the leadership of the party is indispensable to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The article pointed out that denying the party's leadership over the dictatorship of the proletariat is, in fact, denying the dictatorship of the proletariat itself.

　　The article refuted the erroneous assessment of the international situation in the draft program of the LCY and the crude distortion of the causes of the Cold War and international tensions. The article pointed out that the LCY leaders deny the fact that today's world is divided into two camps with different socio-economic systems, but wrongly describe it as the "existence of two military-political blocs," and believe that the root cause of today's international tensions and the danger of war lies not in the aggressive policies of the imperialist countries, but in the "existence of two military-political blocs." This argument is a slander and defamation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union's active peace-loving policy, which is a perfidious act against the "Peace Declaration" signed with the participation of LCY representatives.

　　The article emphasized that the LCY leaders' declaration of being outside all "blocs" is actually a surrender to the imperialists who are scheming to undermine the socialist countries. The article said that we still clearly remember the counter-revolutionary face of Nagy, who wanted to neutralize Hungary, and the consequences he brought about.

　　The article continued, "It is particularly strange that the draft program of the LCY attributes the division of Korea to the 'confrontation of two military-political blocs.'" To the Korean people who have been fighting against U.S. imperialism for the unification and independence of their motherland for more than ten years, this claim by the LCY leaders is absurd.

　　The article said that the division of Korea and the continuation of this situation are because the U.S. imperialists have forcibly occupied South Korea, violated international conventions, obstructed the unification of Korea, pieced together a puppet regime in South Korea, and attempted to permanently divide Korea. U.S. imperialism used force to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, established according to the will of the Korean people, and after being defeated in the war, it still tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful unification of Korea. U.S. imperialism's colonial policy of plundering South Korea and its ambition to monopolize Korea's resources and markets and turn Korea into a bridgehead for aggression in Asia are well known.

　　The article said that the LCY program also places great hopes on the "aid" of the United States and promotes its "fairness." However, the Korean people have long learned about the consequences of U.S. aid. The result of U.S. "aid" in South Korea is that the national industry has been completely destroyed, agriculture has been abandoned, and the people have been plunged into misery.

　　The article said that the LCY leaders' view on the division of Korea and on the "aid" of imperialism objectively legitimizes the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and gives an incorrect assessment of the arduous and just struggle of the Korean people for the freedom and independence of their motherland and for peace in Asia.

　　The article said that today, the attitude of the workers' parties towards proletarian internationalism has become one of the fundamental criteria for defining the nature of this party. However, the draft program of the LCY and the speeches of the LCY leaders describe the internationalist solidarity between the countries of the socialist camp as a kind of "master-subordinate relationship," which is exactly the same as the clamor made by the U.S. imperialists in South Korea every day.

　　The article said that in the forty years since the great October Revolution, the experience of the international workers' movement and the lessons of various international events in recent years have proved how precious the unity between fraternal parties and the people of all countries is. The Korean Workers' Party deeply feels through its own experience how valuable it is to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in opposing imperialist aggression, safeguarding national independence, and building socialism. The Korean people were liberated by the Soviet army and have been continuously assisted by the Soviet people since liberation. How can the LCY leaders confuse the great assistance given to the Korean people by the Soviet people with the relationship of domination and subordination between imperialist countries?

　　The article also refuted the malicious propaganda carried out by the LCY leaders against the leading role of the Soviet Union in the international workers' movement. The article said that the LCY leaders' slander and vilification of the Soviet Union further reveals their anti-Marxist essence.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”批判南共纲领  南共领导人曲解朝鲜分裂原因  企图使美国霸占南朝鲜合法化

　　朝鲜“劳动新闻”批判南共纲领
    南共领导人曲解朝鲜分裂原因
    企图使美国霸占南朝鲜合法化
    新华社平壤15日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表了一篇批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的文章，题目是：“反对现代修正主义”。
    文章首先指出，现代修正主义集中地表现在最近举行的南共第七次代表大会所通过的纲领草案和南共领导人在会上所发表的演说中。文章指出，南共领导人把苏联共产党以及各国共产党和工人党对他们的批判说成是“干涉内政”，并且固执地坚持他们的修正主义见解。
    文章说，南共领导人在诋毁马克思列宁主义的革命性的党的活动为“教条主义”的同时所提出的“创造性”的理论，绝不是什么新的东西。它实质上只不过是伯恩斯坦和考茨基等第二国际修正主义者的反马克思主义理论的翻版。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案中提出的对社会主义革命的荒谬见解。文章指出，纲领草案不承认资产阶级国家的阶级本质。从纲领草案的说法看来，好像通过国家资本主义也可能完成从资本主义过渡到社会主义的过程；好像压迫和剥削劳动人民的资产阶级国家会离开它的阶级立场，为了劳动人民的解放而自动地进行社会主义改造。南共纲领草案认为，通过国家资本主义和通过所谓“社会主义因素”的逐渐成长，也可以和平地进入社会主义。很显然，这是同伯恩斯坦的社会主义的“和平生长说”没有区别的。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案对无产阶级专政和民主集中制的攻击。文章说，如果从无产阶级专政中删除了民主集中制的原则和镇压反革命的机能，那就等于取消了无产阶级专政，南共纲领草案起草人的主张实质上是否认无产阶级专政的。文章强调说，十多年来在同美帝国主义相对峙的情况下进行着激烈的阶级斗争和社会主义建设的朝鲜人民，决不能同意南共纲领草案起草人关于官僚主义比阶级敌人还要危险的见解。
    文章说，无产阶级专政中最根本的问题是马克思列宁主义政党的领导。但是，南斯拉夫的修正主义者却并不认为党的领导对无产阶级专政是不可缺少的。文章指出，否认党对无产阶级专政的领导，实际上是否认无产阶级专政本身。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案中对国际形势的错误的评价以及对冷战和国际紧张局势的原因的粗暴的歪曲。文章指出，南共领导人否认今天的世界分成具有不同的社会经济体系的两个阵营这一事实，而错误地说成是“两个军事政治集团的存在”，并且认为今天国际紧张局势和战争危险的根源不在于帝国主义国家的侵略政策，而在于“两个军事政治集团的存在”。这种论调是中伤和诽谤以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的积极爱好和平的政策，这是违背有南共代表参加签署的“和平宣言”的背信行为。
    文章强调指出，南共领导人宣布处于一切“集团”之外，这实际上是向处心积虑地企图破坏社会主义国家的帝国主义者投降。文章说，我们还清楚地记得要使匈牙利中立化的纳吉的反革命面目和他所招致的后果。
    文章继续说，特别奇怪的是，南共纲领草案把朝鲜分裂的原因说成是“两个军事政治集团的对立”。在十多年来为了祖国的统一独立同美帝国主义者进行着斗争的朝鲜人民看来，南共领导人的这种主张是荒谬绝伦的。
    文章说，朝鲜的分裂以及这种状况的持续是因为美帝国主义者强占了南朝鲜，并且违反国际公约，阻挠朝鲜的统一，在南朝鲜拼凑傀儡政权，企图永久分裂朝鲜。美帝国主义用武力进攻了根据朝鲜人民的意志建立的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在战争中遭到失败以后，仍然千方百计地阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。美帝国主义这种掠夺南朝鲜的殖民政策和企图独霸朝鲜的资源和市场，并且把朝鲜变为侵略亚洲的桥头堡的野心是尽人皆知的。
    文章说，南共纲领还对美国的“援助”寄予很大的期望，并且宣扬它的“公正性”。但是，朝鲜人民对美援的后果早已领教过了。美国“援助”在南朝鲜造成的结果是：民族工业破坏无余，农业荒废，人民陷于水深火热之中。
    文章说，南共领导人对朝鲜分裂和对帝国主义的“援助”的看法，客观上是使美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜合法化，并且给予朝鲜人民为祖国的自由独立，为亚洲的和平而进行的艰苦、正义的斗争以不正确的评价。
    文章说，今天，工人阶级的政党对无产阶级国际主义采取什么态度成为规定这个党的性质的根本性的标准之一。但是南共纲领草案和南共领导人的演说把社会主义阵营各国之间的国际主义团结说成是某种“主从关系”，这同美帝国主义者在南朝鲜天天发出的叫嚷完全相同。
    文章说，从伟大的十月革命以来的四十年间，国际工人运动的经验和近年来各种国际事件的教训证明，各国兄弟党和各国人民之间的团结是多么宝贵。朝鲜劳动党通过自己的经验深切地感到，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，在反对帝国主义的侵略、维护民族独立和建设社会主义方面是多么宝贵。朝鲜人民是由苏联军队解放的，解放以后不断得到苏联人民的援助。怎么能够像南共领导人那样把苏联人民给予朝鲜人民的巨大援助同帝国主义国家之间的统治和隶属关系相混同呢？
    文章还驳斥了南共领导人针对苏联在国际工人运动中的领导作用所进行的恶毒宣传。文章说，南共领导人对于苏联的中伤和污蔑进一步显露出他们的反马克思主义的本质。
