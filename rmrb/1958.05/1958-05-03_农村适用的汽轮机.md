    A 7.5-kilowatt small steam turbine suitable for rural use has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Joint State-Private Machine United Machinery Factory. The total weight of this small steam turbine does not exceed 250 kilograms. If the electricity generated by it to drive a generator is used entirely for lighting, it can meet the electricity needs of 300 households. It can also drive machinery for rice milling, threshing, chopping straw, irrigation, and other work.
