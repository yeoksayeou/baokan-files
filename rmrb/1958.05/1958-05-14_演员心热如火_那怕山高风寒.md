　　Actors' Hearts Burn Like Fire, Undaunted by High Mountains and Cold Winds
    Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Beijing Opera Troupe and the National Song and Dance Troupe traveled over a thousand kilometers, crossing mountains four to five thousand meters above sea level, bringing short, concise, and production-integrated theatrical programs to the workers and staff of the industrial and mining areas in the Qaidam Basin and Datong. They performed programs such as "Flowers and Youngsters," Shandong fast talk, and folk song performances, which were extremely popular.
    Since the beginning of this year, the Qinghai Provincial Beijing Opera Troupe and the National Song and Dance Troupe have also visited the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Qaidam Basin to provide performance for the workers. The members of these two troupes often braved the cold winds and snow in an environment of low air pressure and unpredictable weather, persisting in performing for the troops, workers, and Tibetans.

　　演员心热如火  那怕山高风寒
    青海省京剧团和民族歌舞剧团，最近跋涉千余公里，越过拔海四五千公尺的高山，把短小精悍结合生产的剧目带给了柴达木盆地和大通等地工矿区的职工们。他们演出了“花儿和少年”、山东快书、民歌演唱等节目，极受欢迎。
    今年以来，青海省京剧团和民族歌舞剧团还曾先后到玉树藏族自治州和柴达木盆地慰问演出。这两个剧团的团员们在气压低，天气变化莫测的环境里，常常冒着寒风和雪，坚持为部队、工人、藏民演出。
