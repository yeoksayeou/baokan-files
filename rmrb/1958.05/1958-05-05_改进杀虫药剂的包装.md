Letter to the Editor:

    The 1605 insecticide produced by Tianjin Pesticide Factory is highly toxic, and it is easy to break when packed in glass bottles, which is very unsafe. On April 20th, when we were cleaning up the broken medicine bottles, three people were poisoned. Fortunately, they received timely first aid, and no personal accidents occurred. The manufacturing unit should consider using sturdy containers for packaging to ensure safety.

    改进杀虫药剂的包装
    天津市农药厂出产的1605杀虫药剂毒性很大，用玻璃瓶装容易撞碎，很不安全。4月20日，我们在清理被撞碎的药瓶时，有三个人中毒，幸及时急救，未造成人身事故。生产单位应该考虑改用坚固的容器盛装，以保证安全。
