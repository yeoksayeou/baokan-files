Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Korean People's Delegation, led by Head of Delegation Xu Zhen-suk and Deputy Head of Delegation Kim Chun-hae, arrived in Beijing by train tonight for a friendly visit to our country. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by over a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital at Beijing Railway Station.

    The Beijing Railway Station flew the national flags of China and Korea tonight, and huge banners with "Salute to the heroic Korean people" and "Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people" were hung high. When the distinguished guests stepped off the train at about 10 o'clock, the band played welcome music, and continuous applause and cheers erupted on the entire station platform, and young women from the capital presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

    Head of Delegation Xu Zhen-suk addressed the welcoming crowd amidst thunderous applause. Speaking about the purpose of the delegation's visit to China, she said: "In the most difficult period for our Korean people, the Chinese people have long protected and nurtured the children of our patriotic martyrs and war orphans. Our Korean People's Delegation is visiting your country to convey the greatest gratitude of the Korean Labor Party and the Republic Government and the Korean people to the Chinese people for this."

    Xu Zhen-suk said: "The friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples, forged through a long history, have been further consolidated and developed in the struggle against the common enemy, Japanese imperialism, and in the common struggle to repel the American imperialist aggression against Korea and to safeguard peace and socialism." The full support of the Government of the People's Republic of China for the February 5 statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea have opened up new prospects for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, which is a great contribution to maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world."

    Xu Zhen-suk concluded: "The people of Korea and China are closely united in the great socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and have made great achievements in socialist construction. In our common great cause, the people of Korea and China will always be together and will gloriously defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp."

    Before Xu Zhen-suk's speech, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered a speech on behalf of the Chinese people, warmly welcoming the Korean guests and wishing them complete success in their visit to our country. He said: "The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people has a long history. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression, our two peoples fought side by side and won a great victory. In recent years, the friendly cooperative and mutual assistance relations between our two countries have developed greatly. We firmly believe that the visit of the Korean People's Delegation to our country will further enhance the long-standing deep friendship between our two peoples."

    Also present at the station tonight to welcome the distinguished guests were the responsible persons of relevant departments Liao Chengzhi, Xie Juezai, Shi Liang, Zhang Xiruo, Li Dequan, Kang Keqing, Wang Ziyi, Chen Qiyuan, Wang Yifu, Xia Yan, Liu Zhijian, Le Songsheng, Wu Yunfu, Tong Ying, Chen Boqing, etc., as well as the returned representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun and Major General Zhong Guochu.

    北京车站今晚飘扬着中朝两国国旗，高悬着“向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬”和“中朝人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁”的巨幅标语。当贵宾们在十时许步下火车后，乐队高奏欢迎乐曲，整个车站月台上爆发出连绵不断的掌声和欢呼声，首都女青年向贵宾们献了鲜花。

    许贞琡团长最后说：“朝中两国人民紧紧地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭里，在社会主义建设中都取得了伟大的成就。在我们共同的伟大事业中，朝中两国人民将永远在一起，将光荣地捍卫社会主义阵营的东方前哨。”
