　　Guangdong and Henan Expand Sweet Potato Area
    (By our correspondents) Guangdong Province is putting as much effort into sweet potato production as it is into rice production, taking it as a particularly important measure to increase production and achieve a per-mu grain yield of 800 jin ahead of schedule.

    Sweet potato is the highest-yielding grain crop in Guangdong. Most areas can plant it in spring, autumn, and winter. All regions of the province have high-yield sweet potato records. Therefore, while emphasizing rice production, grasping the key to massively increasing sweet potato production is of great significance for the rapid leap forward in grain yield per mu. One method Guangdong Province is using to greatly increase sweet potato production is to increase yield per unit area, ensuring an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu for spring-planted and winter-planted sweet potatoes, and 3,000 jin per mu for autumn-planted sweet potatoes. Another measure is to expand the sweet potato planting area. This year, the province will plant 29 million mu (not including 3 million mu of newly reclaimed land), an increase of 12 million mu over last year. Currently, the province has planted 3 million mu of spring sweet potatoes, and preparations for planting 11 million mu of autumn sweet potatoes are underway. (Zheng Shiwen)
    (By our correspondents) Henan Province has decided this year to expand the sweet potato planting area from 16 million mu last year to more than 25 million mu, without squeezing out economic crops. In order to increase the yield per unit area of this crop, Party and government organizations at all levels are organizing the masses to find ways and tap potential, widely carrying out activities such as deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, and cultivating and adjusting seed potato seedlings, so as to ensure that sweet potatoes are planted early and well.

　　广东河南扩大甘薯面积
    本报讯　广东省正以领导水稻生产的劲头，大搞甘薯生产，把它作为提前完成亩产粮食八百斤的一个特别重要的增产措施。
    甘薯是广东粮食作物中的最高产作物，大部分地区都可以在春、秋、冬三季种植。全省各地区都有甘薯高产记录。因此，在强调稻谷生产的同时，抓住大量增产甘薯的关键，对粮食亩产量的迅速跃进具有重大意义。广东省大搞甘薯生产的一个办法是提高单位面积产量，保证春种甘薯和冬种甘薯平均亩产二千斤，秋种甘薯三千斤。另一条措施是扩大甘薯种植面积。今年全省种植二千九百万亩（另开荒三百万亩不在内），比去年增加了一千二百万亩。现在，全省已经种下三百万亩春种甘薯，一千一百万亩秋植甘薯的准备工作正在紧张进行中。　（郑世文）
    本报讯　河南省今年决定在不挤掉经济作物的前提下，把甘薯种植面积由去年的一千六百万亩扩大到二千五百万亩以上。为了提高这项作物的单位面积产量，各级党政组织正组织群众千方百计找窍门、挖潜力，广泛开展深翻土地，增施肥料，培育与调剂种薯苗等活动，务使红薯种早，种好。（曲明振）
