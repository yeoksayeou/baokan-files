New Provocations Against the People of North Africa
Commentator of this newspaper

    The fascist riots in France have further intensified the situation in North Africa. For several days, the French colonial army has repeatedly invaded Tunisian territory and attacked Tunisian military strongholds. On May 25th, the French air force stationed in Algeria dispatched a large number of aircraft to carry out a frenzied bombing and strafing of southern Tunisia.
    This series of events in Tunisia is by no means an accidental conflict, but a planned provocation. According to the "Daily Express" correspondent in Algeria, Smith, after the military coup in Algeria, the French army was prepared to "arrange the entire North African situation themselves"; 35,000 paratroopers and 120,000 French regular soldiers were on standby on the Tunisian border, ready to launch an offensive as soon as the order was given. The current French army is constantly creating incidents, obviously to find an excuse to invade Tunisia. Salan, the commander-in-chief of the French colonial army stationed in Algeria, publicly clamored on the 21st that if "border incidents" continue to occur, he would "not hesitate" to order the French army to "counterattack" and enter Tunisia.
    Fascism means war! This is a truth that has been fully proven by history. The fascist forces currently rampant in France have gradually risen in the course of years of colonial wars. Therefore, their intention is not only to establish a dictatorial rule in France, but also to carry out colonial suppression more frantically, to expand the Algerian war to the entire North Africa, and currently to expand it to Tunisia first.
    Just as the fascists try to hide their conspiracy to overthrow the republican system, they also try to hide their attempt to expand the colonial war. Because they understand that these activities will arouse the anger of the North African people and peace-loving people of all countries. In order to confuse the masses, the fascists have long been propagating that de Gaulle's rise to power will adopt a "free" and "enlightened" policy towards North Africa. The rioters in Algeria even used guns to force Muslim civilians to express "loyalty" to the "Committee of Public Safety," trying to make people believe that the Algerian people and the French colonialists were filled with a "spirit of unity."
    Of course, these shameless methods cannot deceive anyone with a brain. And the current provocative actions of the French army in Tunisia have completely exposed the nonsense of so-called "enlightened policies" and "spirit of unity."
    Faced with the French fascist group's conspiracy to expand the colonial war, the North African people are urgently mobilizing. The Algerian National Liberation Front has issued a statement condemning the French fascists' abuse and insults of Muslim civilians, and expressing its determination to use "increasingly resolute" fighting to smash the French colonialists' "last-ditch" military adventure. The Tunisian government has declared a state of emergency throughout the country and called on the people to "remain vigilant and prepare to deal with possible aggression." The Moroccan government has also closed the border to prevent the French army from carrying out provocations. In addition, in Tunisia and Morocco, the struggle for the withdrawal of French troops is unfolding.
    France has already suffered serious setbacks in its colonial war in Algeria. Now, the strength of the Algerian people is much greater than in the past, and the unity of the North African people has been further strengthened. The French fascist forces' attempt to expand military adventures and spread the flames of war to the entire North Africa will obviously have no other result than accelerating their failure.

    对北非人民新的挑衅
    本报评论员
    法国的法西斯暴乱，使北非局势进一步紧张起来了。几天以来，法国殖民军队一再侵犯突尼斯的领土，袭击突尼斯的军事据点。5月25日，法国驻阿尔及利亚的空军又出动大批飞机，对突尼斯的南部地区进行了疯狂的轰炸和扫射。
    在突尼斯发生的这一系列事件，决不是偶然的冲突，而是一种有计划的挑衅活动。据英国“每日快报”驻阿尔及利亚记者史密斯透露，在阿尔及利亚军事政变发生以后，法国军队就准备好“由他们自己来安排整个北非局势”；有三万五千名伞兵和十二万法国正规军人已经在突尼斯边境枕戈而待，只要一下命令就可以发动进攻。目前法国军队不断制造事件，显然就是要为侵略突尼斯寻找借口。法国驻阿尔及利亚殖民军总司令萨兰在21日已经公然叫嚣：如果“边境事件”继续发生，他将“毫不迟疑地”命令法国军队“反攻”，进入突尼斯。
    法西斯主义就是战争！这是已经被历史所充分证明了的真理。目前在法国猖狂活动的法西斯势力，是在经年的殖民战争中逐渐抬头的。因此，它们的企图不但是要在法国建立独裁统治；而且是要更加疯狂地进行殖民镇压，把阿尔及利亚战争扩大到整个北非，而在目前首先扩大到突尼斯去。
    正如法西斯分子力图隐藏推翻共和制度的阴谋一样，他们也力图隐藏扩大殖民战争的企图。因为，他们懂得，这些勾当将激起北非人民和各国爱好和平人民的愤怒。为了迷惑群众，法西斯分子很久以来就一直宣传说，戴高乐上台后将会对北非采取一种“自由的”和“开明的”政策。在阿尔及利亚的暴乱者甚至还用枪杆子逼迫穆斯林平民对“救国委员会”表示“忠诚”，企图使人相信在阿尔及利亚人民和法国殖民主义者之间是充满着“团结精神”的。
    当然，这些无耻的手法决不能骗过任何有头脑的人。而法国军队目前在突尼斯的挑衅行动，更是完全戳穿了所谓“开明政策”和“团结精神”的那些鬼话。
    面对着法国法西斯集团扩大殖民战争的阴谋，北非人民正在紧急动员。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经发表声明，谴责法国法西斯分子对穆斯林平民的虐待和侮辱，并且表示用“越来越坚决”的战斗来粉碎法国殖民主义者“孤注一掷”的军事冒险。突尼斯政府已经宣布全国处于紧急状态，并且号召人民“保持警惕，准备对付可能的侵略”。摩洛哥政府也已经封锁边境，防止法国军队进行挑衅。此外，在突尼斯和摩洛哥两国，要求法国军队撤退的斗争正在展开着。
    法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争中已经遭到了严重的挫折。现在，阿尔及利亚人民的力量比过去壮大得多了，北非人民的团结也进一步加强了。法国的法西斯势力企图扩大军事冒险，把战火烧到整个北非，除了加速他们的失败而外，显然是不会有其它结果的。
