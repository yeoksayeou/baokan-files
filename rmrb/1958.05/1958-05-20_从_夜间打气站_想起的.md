　　Thoughts Inspired by the "Night-Time Tire Inflation Station"
    A few days ago, I went to the Tianqiao Theater to see a play. After the play ended, it was already midnight. I rode my bike towards Fuxingmenwai. After a few steps, the tire went flat, and I had no choice but to push it back. But when I walked to Qianmen Street, I saw a "Night-Time Tire Inflation Station" on the west side of the road. It was a bicycle repair production cooperative. The door was already closed, but there was a hole in the threshold, and an air pump was pulled out with an iron chain attached. A sign was posted on the doorpost, reading "Night-Time Tire Inflation Station," and a small electric light was installed for illumination. I was overjoyed and inflated the tire. Looking back, the room was pitch black, and the owner was already sound asleep. It occurred to me: although this matter is ordinary, it has a very deep meaning, because the members of the bicycle repair production cooperative came up with this method so that it can still serve others in the late night after they go to sleep. I felt a new kind of interpersonal relationship being established in our socialist country. I hope that the comrades in other service industries will also try their best to come up with various ways to serve the people.

　　从“夜间打气站”想起的
    前几天，我到天桥剧场去看戏，散戏后已是半夜，我骑车回复兴门外，走了几步后车胎泄了气，没办法只好推着回去。但走到前门大街，看见路西有一个“夜间打气站”，那是一家修理自行车生产合作社，门早已关闭，从门槛上掏了个窟窿，拉出一根铁链子拴着一个气筒，门柱子上贴了一张条子，写着“夜间打气站”，还装着一盏小电灯来照明。我喜出望外地打上了气，回头看了一眼，屋里漆黑一片，主人早已酣睡。我想到：这件事情虽然平凡，但却具有很深含义，因为修理自行车生产合作社的社员们想出这个办法，使它在自己睡觉以后的深夜里，仍然能为别人服务。我感到了一种新的人与人之间的关系在我们的社会主义国家里建立起来。希望其他各服务行业的职工同志，也千方百计地想出各种各样为人民服务的方法来。
