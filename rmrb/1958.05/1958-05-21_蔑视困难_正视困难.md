Despise Difficulties, Face Difficulties
Wu Lü

Starting today, the national railway system will implement a new train schedule. Passengers traveling east-west and north-south can greatly reduce their travel time. Journeys that previously required overnight travel can now be completed from morning till evening. The average speed of freight trains can also be increased by about three kilometers per hour. This is a piece of good news brought to the people of the whole country by the great leap forward of railway workers.

Accelerating the speed of trains is not an easy task. The permissible speed of the tracks, the technical condition of the locomotives, the operating time of the stations, and the organizational work of the entire transportation system all affect the improvement of running speed. In particular, such a large-scale shortening of train running time across the country is a very difficult thing. However, such a "very difficult" and "very challenging" task has quickly become a reality. Has it not only been a few months since the Beijing Railway Administration first organized test runs to accelerate the speed of trains on the Beijing-Tianjin line? In a matter of months, the seeds of advancement have blossomed and borne fruit across the country, achieving rapid results, truly like a horse galloping to success.

Since the Great Leap Forward, it has become commonplace for very difficult and very challenging things to be quickly realized. Is there any secret to this? Judging from the railway's acceleration of train speeds, the most important things are probably two points: despising difficulties and facing difficulties.

Difficulties can be real or imagined. False difficulties are purely the excuses of conservatives and do not exist in life. But besides this, there are also real difficulties, and these difficulties are also abundant, which are the contradictions for which no solution has yet been found in the work. We must despise these objectively existing difficulties! Marxists have always believed that the various aspects of contradictions can be transformed under certain conditions. Weakness can be transformed into strength, unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors, and contradictions that seem impossible to solve today can be completely solved tomorrow. The problem lies only in people, in giving play to people's subjective initiative, and in following the laws of motion of contradictions to promote the transformation of the various aspects of contradictions. Therefore, all objectively existing difficulties are not at all frightening. As long as we have the courage to despise them, it is possible to overcome them. If railway workers did not have the courage to despise difficulties, to dare to think and dare to act, it would be impossible to greatly increase the speed of trains.

However, while despising difficulties, we must also face difficulties. Since difficulties are the reflection of objectively existing contradictions for which no solutions have yet been found, they cannot be simply erased. On the contrary, we must face difficulties and raise them. Some people are now afraid to raise difficulties, as if raising difficulties is "right-leaning conservatism." In fact, admitting difficulties is not a bad thing. Acknowledging difficulties, like despising difficulties, is the prerequisite for overcoming difficulties, and its purpose is to overcome difficulties. Why were so many new technical measures taken and so much detailed organizational work carried out in implementing the new train schedule? This is to recognize objectively existing difficulties and use these technical measures and organizational work to overcome them.

### 蔑视困难　正视困难

    蔑视困难　正视困难
    吴滤
    从今天起，全国铁路实行新的火车时刻表了。东来西往、南下北上的旅客们花费在旅途上的时间可以大大减少，从前需要在火车上过夜的，现在朝发夕至。货物列车平均每小时也可以多跑三公里左右的路程。这是铁路职工大跃进给全国人民带来的喜讯。
    加快列车的运行速度，这件事很不容易。线路的允许速度，机车的技术状况，车站的作业时间和整个运输的组织工作，在在都影响运行速度的提高；特别是在全国范围内来这样一次大规模的缩短列车运行时间，更是非常困难的事情。然而，这样一件“很不容易”的、“非常困难”的事情，却已很快地变成眼前的事实了。从北京铁路管理局首次在北京至天津的线路上组织加快运行速度的试车以来，不是只过了几个月的时间吗？几个月的时间，先进的种子已在全国开花结果，收效神速，真如马到成功一般。
    大跃进以来，很不容易的、非常困难的事情，很快地付诸实现，已经是屡见不鲜的了。这里，有没有什么秘诀呢？从铁路加快列车运行速度这件事来看，恐怕最重要的还是两点：蔑视困难，正视困难。
    困难有真、有假。假的困难，纯粹是保守主义者的借口，生活中并不存在。但除此以外，还有真的困难，并且这些困难也是大量存在的，这就是工作中还没有找到解决办法的矛盾。对这种客观存在的困难，我们要蔑视它！马克思主义者从来就认为矛盾的诸方面是可以在一定的条件下转化的，弱可以转化为强，不利的因素可以转化为有利的因素，今天看来是没有办法解决的矛盾，明天完全可以有办法解决。问题只在于人、在于发挥人的主观能动性，循看矛盾的运动规律，来促进矛盾诸方面的转化。因此，一切客观存在的困难都毫不可怕，只要我们有胆量去蔑视它，就有可能去克服它。铁路工人若没有蔑视困难的气魄，敢想敢为，是不可能把列车运行速度大加提高的。
    然而，一方面蔑视困难，一方面又要正视困难。困难既然是客观存在的还没有找到解决办法的矛盾的反映，就不可一笔抹煞。相反地，要正视困难，把困难提出来。现在有些人不敢提困难，好像一提困难就是“右倾保守”。其实，承认困难并不是坏事。承认困难同蔑视困难一样，是克服困难的前提，其目的是为了去战胜困难。为什么实行新的火车时刻表曾采取了许多新的技术措施，进行了许多细致的组织工作呢？这就是认识客观存在的困难，用这些技术措施和组织工作去战胜困难。
