Spring Arrives, Silkworm Rearing is Busy

　　This newspaper reports that the silkworm rearing season has arrived in the vast silkworm areas. 1.99 million sheets of silkworm eggs have been distributed to various silkworm areas as scheduled. The silkworm egg distribution this year increased by 4.2% compared with last year. Henan Province increased by 15,000 sheets, Anhui Province increased by 23,000 sheets, and Guangdong Province increased by 15,000 sheets. Silkworm areas outside Guangdong have successively started the work of removing and hatching silkworm eggs from warehouses since the end of March, and some areas have entered the tense stage of receiving silkworms and raising silkworms.

　　Tussah silkworm areas have also released silkworms onto the mountains. The growth of tussah silkworms and tussah trees is generally better this year than last year.

　　This year, all localities have strengthened mulberry garden management to increase leaf production. In Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, the average fertilizer application per mu in many mulberry gardens has increased by more than two times. In Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, all 70,582 mu of mulberry gardens have been fertilized. In Wu Xing County, mulberry trees are sprouting well and are expected to increase production by 25% compared with last year. Linqu County, Shandong Province, launched a movement to water mulberry trees to combat drought. These are all unprecedented measures. While supplementing and renewing existing old mulberry gardens, all localities are also actively developing new mulberry gardens. In the past winter and this spring, incomplete statistics from provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, and Hubei show that 1.61 million mu of new mulberry trees have been planted, an increase of about 60% compared with the original mulberry field area.
