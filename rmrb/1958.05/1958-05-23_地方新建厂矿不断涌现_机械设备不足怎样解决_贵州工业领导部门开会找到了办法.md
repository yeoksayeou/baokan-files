Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 22nd (Xinhua Reporter Zhao Jialie): With the continuous emergence of new local factories and mines, the demand for mechanical equipment is exceeding supply. This is an urgent problem to be solved in Guizhou Province after the whole Party and all people began to run industry. Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Industrial Leadership Department convened a meeting of leading cadres in charge of industrial development from various special districts (autonomous prefectures) and responsible cadres from ten larger machinery factories to discuss solutions to this problem.

The meeting determined that, based on Guizhou's resource situation and the existing production capacity of the machinery industry, the mechanical equipment problems of new factories and mines should be solved according to priorities. First, priority should be given to providing complete sets of equipment for smelting pig iron, to ensure the realization of the plan to increase pig iron production from 90,000 tons to 150,000 tons this year, so that the machinery industry itself can obtain sufficient raw materials for production. Second, manufacture complete sets of smelting equipment for copper, lead, zinc, and mercury, to provide more raw materials for the country's large-scale industry. Third, manufacture complete sets of equipment for factories producing synthetic oil, cement, and chemical fertilizers. Fourth, supplement the necessary machinery lacking in some factories and mines. At the same time, the meeting required new factories and mines in various places to start with indigenous methods first, and then gradually move towards mechanization.

The meeting made specific arrangements for the production cooperation of various machinery factories, determining that under the principle of not greatly changing the production tasks arranged by the state and the province, the product lineup should be appropriately adjusted, so that the ten larger machinery enterprises can fully utilize the production potential of their original equipment. For example, the production task of the Tai Ciqiao Iron Factory in Guiyang for wheel-less single-blade plows was assigned to the special district's farm tool factory. The Tai Ciqiao Iron Factory accepted the production tasks of hand winches, small mine cars, etc. from the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, and mainly produced small complete sets of smelting equipment. The Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory concentrated on producing medium-sized winches, crushers and other mining machinery, and also increased the production of complete sets of equipment for more than ten synthetic oil plants, fertilizer plants, and cement plants. Other factories all devolved the production of some products that directly serve the people's lives to smaller factories. After such adjustments, the province can increase the production of 70 sets of iron smelting furnace equipment with a volume of 6.5 cubic meters this year (including complete sets of components such as hot blast pipes, blowers, and gas engines), 25 sets of mercury smelting equipment, 17 sets of lead smelting equipment, as well as the equipment for more than ten small and medium-sized synthetic oil, fertilizer, and cement plants. It can also increase the production of nearly 100 winches, rock drills, gas engines, motors and other machinery.

Through the meeting, the leading cadres of various factories who attended learned about the urgent needs of various places, and bravely undertook orders exceeding the planned tasks. The leading cadres of various new factories and mines who attended, after understanding the existing machinery industry's resources, no longer made excessive demands.

    地方新建厂矿不断涌现  机械设备不足怎样解决
    贵州工业领导部门开会找到了办法
    据新华社贵阳22日电　新华社记者赵家烈报道：随着地方新建厂矿的不断涌现，机械设备显得供不应求，这是贵州省全党全民办工业以后急待解决的问题。贵州省工业领导部门最近召集各专区（州）兴办工业的领导干部和十个较大机械工厂的负责干部开会，讨论了解决这个问题的办法。
    会议确定：根据贵州的资源情况和现有机械工业的生产力量，解决新建厂矿的机械装备问题，要分轻重缓急地进行。首先要重点提供冶炼生铁的成套设备，以保证实现今年生铁产量由九万吨跃进到十五万吨的计划，使机械工业本身得到充足的原料来进行生产。第二，制造铜、铅、锌、汞的成套冶炼设备，以便为国家大工业提供更多的原料。第三，制造合成油、水泥、化学肥料等工厂的成套设备。第四，补足一些厂矿缺少的必需机械。同时，会议要求各地新建厂矿先用土法上马，然后逐步地走向机械化。
    会议对于各机械工厂的生产协作问题作了具体安排，确定在不大变动国家和省所布置的生产任务的原则下，适当调整生产品，使十个较大的机械企业能充分发挥原有设备的生产潜力。如把贵阳太慈桥铁工厂无轮一铧犁的生产任务交给专区农具厂去完成，由太慈桥铁工厂接受贵阳矿山机器厂生产手绞车、小矿车等生产任务，并且主要生产小型全套冶炼设备。贵阳矿山机器厂则集中生产中型卷扬机、破碎机等矿山机械，另外增产十多座合成油厂、化肥厂、水泥厂的成套设备。其他各厂都把一些直接为人民生活服务的产品下放到小厂去生产。经过这样调整，省内今年可以增产六点五立方公尺容积的炼铁炉设备七十套（包括热风管、鼓风机、煤气机等全套机件），炼汞设备二十五套，炼铅设备十七套，以及十几座中小型合成油、化肥、水泥厂的设备，还可以增产近百台卷扬机、锻钎机、煤气机、电动机等机械。
    通过会议，使到会的各厂领导干部知道各地急需以后，都勇敢地承担起超过计划任务的订货。到会的各新建厂矿的领导干部，了解现有机械工业的家底后，也不再提出过高要求。
