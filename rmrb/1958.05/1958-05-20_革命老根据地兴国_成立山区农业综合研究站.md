    Revolutionary Old Base Area Xingguo
    Establishes Mountainous Agricultural Comprehensive Research Station

    (By our newspaper) A mountainous agricultural comprehensive research station has been established in Butou Township, Xingguo, an old revolutionary base area. This station is composed of a group of agricultural scientific research personnel drawn from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, and the Gannan Administrative Office. Fang Cuinong, Deputy Director of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, serves as the director of the station.
    This station focuses on agriculture and conducts comprehensive research on agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and fisheries. It implements the working principle of combining investigation and summarization, experimental research, and demonstration and promotion. Specific projects include crops, soil, fertilizer, plants, fruits, protection, animal husbandry, agricultural economics, tea, afforestation, meteorology, plants, and other items.
    This station has also established three agricultural scientific research groups in the state-owned Junfushan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm, Yinfu Farm, and Jiangbei Soil and Water Conservation Experiment and Promotion Station within the county.
    In order to better organize and lead the development of this research work, the "Xingguo County Agricultural Science Comprehensive Research Committee" was established on April 22. Li Yishu, the First Secretary of the Xingguo County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, serves as the chairman, and Fang Cuinong, Zhang Qishan, Xu Da, and County Head Li Ming serve as the vice chairmen.

    这个站以农业为主，对农、林、水、牧、渔进行综合研究，贯彻执行调查总结，试验研究，示范推广相结合的工作方针。具体项目包括有：作物、土壤、肥料、植物、果树、保护、畜牧、农业经济、茶叶、造林、气象、植物等项目。
    这个站还分别在该县境内的国营均福山综合垦殖农场、殷富农场、江背水土保持试验推广站设立了三个农业科学研究组。
    为了更好的组织和领导这一研究工作的开展，4月22日又成立了“兴国县农业科学综合研究委员会”，由中共兴国县委第一书记李贻树任主任委员，方粹农、张岐山、徐达和县长李明任副主任委员。
