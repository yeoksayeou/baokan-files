For Whom to Design? How to Design?
    – A Record of the Debate on "Three-izations" Among Designers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
    By Our Correspondent Gao Jie
    The technical personnel of the design section of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant recently, while discussing how to realize their proposed great leap forward target of trial-producing 40 new products and designing 100 new products this year, put forward the "three-izations" measures of product serialization, component generalization, and part standardization. However, on how to achieve "three-izations"? What kind of "three-izations" to carry out? A heated debate unfolded among all the design personnel in the section.
    The design personnel called this debate a dispute over how to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in design work. It was an ideological exchange among designers, further expanded on the issue of "how to design" after they had resolved the issue of "for whom to design" during the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle.
    Originally, the so-called "three-izations" had been proposed by some in the section as early as before 1956, but it didn't work. In addition to the lack of firm support from the plant and section leadership, a large part of the reason was that the designers themselves had a strong tendency to separate design from politics and reality.
    I interviewed the plant's chief designer and several chief designers. Chief Designer Ke Gengshen said: Before the rectification campaign, we had not resolved the issue of "designing for whom." A relatively common atmosphere in the section was to design for personal fame and gain, to show off personal talents. Therefore, the more complex and novel the design, the better; old products were considered bad, only new designs were good; designs by others were considered bad, only one's own were good. As for how convenient the design was for production and what the economic benefits were, few people considered it. An engineer designed a universal grinder. He could have improved the old Qiu 13 universal grinder, but he started from scratch and designed the new universal grinder to be very complex. The trial production cost was more than double that of the old product, but the effect was not much better. On weekdays, engineers were not convinced by each other and did not consult each other. Sometimes, even if they knew the design was wrong or wasteful, they would not point it out, but instead would praise each other.
    Under such ideological guidance, the section had two attitudes towards the issue of series design in the past. One was to be detached from China's reality, unilaterally pursuing the world's advanced level, believing that seriesization required a "hundred-year plan" and must be done slowly. The other was to be keen on original self-design. For example, a group was responsible for designing a horizontal spindle rotary table surface grinder. Many parts and components could have been mutually interchangeable with other surface grinders, but they still started from scratch when designing. The plant had already produced dozens of types of feed mechanisms and bearings for various machine tools. Designers were still innovating in self-design, saying, "Let's make it and see." Some even designed parts without knowing where they would be used and asked the leadership to approve trial manufacturing, saying, "This is a new technology, let everyone see it when it's made." During the rectification and the "double anti" movement, the entire section posted more than 12,000 big-character posters criticizing this individualism that was divorced from politics and reality. When everyone now looks back on the gains of this movement, they say: "The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle solved the problem of for whom we serve, and the 'double anti' solved the problem of how to serve."
    Therefore, when the great leap forward target was put forward, everyone further studied how to realize the great leap forward target, considering that design is the first process. It is necessary not only to ensure that the design drawings come out, but also to consider the production conditions and economic benefits, and to consider the future development of the machine tool industry. After everyone's horizons broadened, they discovered a pressing problem: they could no longer continue to design one by one in the old way of "processing with supplied materials." Therefore, the issue of "three-izations" was re-proposed. However, how to achieve "three-izations"? Some people in the section were afraid of difficulties, thinking that only 23 new products were designed last year, and this year, with some personnel being sent to lower levels, 100 types had to be designed, which was too heavy a task! They were also worried that brother departments would not cooperate. Others believed that since the country urgently needed to develop varieties, it could not be done slowly. If the design force was insufficient, everyone could go all out. In fact, since the "double anti" movement, the design cycle has been shortened by more than half. They believed that the method of treating a headache when the head hurts and treating a foot when the foot hurts cannot cure a major illness. To solve the contradiction, a major operation is needed. They advocated immediately ranking all types of machine tools, studying reasonable specifications and layouts, and then considering the design of standard parts and components on this basis.
    At the end of March, a responsible comrade from the Industry Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China went to the factory and, upon learning of the situation, immediately supported the opinions of the revolutionaries. He invited the main technical personnel of the entire factory to a discussion, and presented to everyone the current situation of the rapid industrial development of domestic counties running industries in every county and townships opening factories in every township. He encouraged everyone to accelerate the realization of "three-izations," pointing out that this was "a major event related to the development of the national economy" and "a major event to liberate productive forces and open up roads for technological revolution." His words encouraged the design personnel. Within four hours, everyone fiercely criticized the conservative ideas of the reformists, and at the same time criticized the past practice of being detached from China's reality, unilaterally pursuing the world's advanced ideas, and discarding old products to create a new set. They believed that if they disregarded old products and slowly investigated the situation and collected data all over the country, east, west, north, and south, and then designed and manufactured them, how could they achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Comrades from the production section and other sections also expressed their full support for the design section at the meeting.
    The encouragement of the leadership and the support of brother departments made the design personnel very excited. People who were originally hesitant and conservative on this issue are now also actively involved. They held a meeting overnight that day and continued to discuss it for half a day the next day. Finally, everyone unanimously decided: to do it thoroughly, to do it on a large scale, and to do it quickly. Two days later, the design section came up with the first preliminary plan for the series design of cylindrical grinders. The three main engineers responsible for this design visited professors, experts, and workers to solicit opinions on the design plan. Engineer Yang Daling said: "This is the first time we have truly followed the mass line." They plan to continue to solicit opinions from experts and workers during the design process until it is completed. For many days, people have seen the lights in the design section shining brightly at 9 or 10 o'clock at night. The designers are working late into the night! Many people who used to only care about technology and not about politics now feel that technology and politics, technology and economy must be unified, and that technical work must be "led by politics" in order not to lose direction. Many design personnel have recently formulated personal "red and expert plans" in their spare time from their busy work, listing regular reading of newspapers, subordination of personal interests to national interests, and demanding themselves according to the conditions of Communist Party members as the main contents of the "red and expert plans."

    为谁设计？怎样设计？
    ——记上海机床厂设计人员关于“三化”的争论
    本报记者　高洁
    上海机床厂设计科的技术人员最近在讨论他们如何实现自己提出的今年试制四十种、设计一百种新产品的跃进指标的时候，提出了产品系列化、部件通用化和零件标准化的“三化”措施。但是，对于如何实现“三化”？进行怎样的“三化”？全科设计人员展开了一场异常热烈的争论。
    设计人员称这场争论是关于设计工作如何贯彻多快好省方针的争论，是设计人员在整风和反右斗争中解决了“为谁设计”的问题以后，又在“怎样设计”这个问题上，进一步展开的一次思想交锋。
    原来，所谓“三化”，早在1956年以前，科里就有人提出过，但是，行不通。原因除了厂和科的领导没有坚决支持以外，很大部分是设计人员本身存在着浓厚的设计脱离政治、脱离实际的思想。
    我访问了厂里的总设计师和好几位主任设计师。总设计师柯庚申说：整风以前，我们没有解决“为谁设计”的问题。科里比较普遍的风气是设计为了个人名利，为了表现个人的才华。因此，设计出来的东西越复杂越新奇就好；认为老产品都不好，新设计的才好；别人设计的都不好，自己搞的才好。至于设计出来的东西怎样便利生产，经济效果如何，很少有人考虑。一个工程师设计一台万能磨床，本可以对老的虬13式万能磨床加以改进就行了，可是他另起炉灶，把新的万能磨床设计得非常复杂，试制成本比老产品高出一倍多，而效果好不了多少。平日，工程师之间互不服气，互不请教。有时明知设计错误或是浪费也不提出，还要互相吹捧一通。
    在这样的思想指导下，过去科里对待系列设计问题，有两种态度。一种是脱离中国实际，片面追求世界先进水平，认为搞系列化就得“百年大计”，必须慢慢来。另一种是热中于独出心裁的自行设计。例如一个小组负责设计一种卧轴圆台平面磨床，很多部件、零件本可以与其他平面磨床互相通用，但是设计时仍然从新做起。各种机床的进刀机构和轴承，厂里已生产了好几十种，设计人员在自行设计中，仍然花样翻新，说是“做了试试看”。甚至有的机件设计出来不知用在什么地方，就要求领导批准试造，说：“这是新技术，做出来大家看看”。整风与双反运动中，全科贴了一万二千多张大字报，批评这种脱离政治、脱离实际的个人主义。大家现在回顾这次运动的收获时说：“整风和反右派斗争解决了我们为谁服务的问题，双反解决了怎样服务的问题。”
    因此，当跃进指标提了出来，大家进一步研究怎样实现跃进指标的时候，考虑到设计是第一道工序，不仅要保证设计图纸出来，还要考虑生产条件和经济效果，要考虑机床工业今后的发展。当大家眼界开阔以后，发现了一个逼人的问题：不能再照老办法那样用“来料加工”的方式一个一个地单个设计下去了。于是，重新提出了“三化”的问题。但是，怎样实现“三化”呢？科里有的人畏难，认为去年只设计二十三种新产品，今年部分人员下放，要设计一百种，任务太重了！他们还耽心兄弟科室不配合、不协作。另一些人则认为国家既然迫切需要发展品种，就不能慢慢来。设计力量不足，大家可以鼓足干劲。事实上“双反”以后，设计周期已经缩短了一半以上。他们认为头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法除不了大病，要解决矛盾就要动大手术，主张立即将各类机床排队，研究出合理的规格和布局，然后在这个基础上考虑设计标准部件和零件。
    3月末的一天，中共上海市委工业工作部的一位负责同志去到厂里，知道了这些情况，立即支持了革命派的意见。他邀请全厂主要技术人员座谈，向大家提出了当前国内县县办工业、乡乡开工厂的工业化飞跃发展形势，鼓励大家加快实现“三化”，指出这是“关系到国民经济发展的大事”，是“解放生产力和为技术革命开拓道路的大事”。他的话鼓舞着设计人员，四个钟头之内，大家猛烈地批评了改良主义者的保守思想，同时批判了过去那种脱离中国实际、片面追求世界先进的想法，批判了过去丢开老产品，独出心裁另搞一套的做法，认为丢开老产品不顾，而到全国东西南北慢条斯理地调查情况、搜集资料，然后再设计、再制造，又如何能够做到多快好省呢？生产科同其它科室的同志，也在会上表示全力支持设计科。
    领导的鼓励，兄弟科室的支持，使设计人员非常兴奋。原来在这个问题上犹豫、保守的人，现在也积极起来。他们当天晚上连夜开会，第二天又接着讨论了半天。最后，大家一致决定：彻底搞，大搞，快搞。两天之后，设计科拿出了第一个外圆磨床的系列设计初步方案。三个主要负责这项设计的工程师分头拜访教授、专家和工人，征求对设计方案的意见。工程师杨大龄说：“这是我们第一次真正走群众路线。”他们打算在设计中途到完成，还要继续征求专家和工人的意见。好多天来，人们入夜以后，晚间九、十点钟，还看到设计科里灯火通明。设计人员们在挑灯夜战呢！许多过去只管技术、不问政治的人，现在感到技术与政治、技术与经济必须统一了，技术工作必须以“政治做统帅”，才不会迷失方向。很多设计人员最近在紧张工作之余，制订了个人的“红专规划”把经常读报、个人利益服从国家利益、以共产党员条件要求自己等等，列为“红专规划”的主要内容。
