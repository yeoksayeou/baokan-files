Industrial Production Great Leap Forward What to do about insufficient manpower?
Digging Potential Locally—Yangquan's Path is Correct
    (By Our Correspondent) This newspaper reported from Shanxi: In the great leap forward in industrial production, how to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor? Yangquan City adopted twelve measures and excavated 10,000 laborers, which basically solved the difficulty of insufficient labor this year.
    According to the Great Leap Forward plan, Yangquan City's total industrial output value this year increased by 66.05% compared with last year, the investment in capital construction increased by nearly doubled, and more than a dozen larger enterprises are to be expanded, and dozens of new factories and mines are to be put into production. According to this plan, the city needs to increase more than 20,000 laborers. This number is equivalent to more than two-thirds of the city's existing total number of workers. How to solve this difficulty? Some enterprises are reaching out to ask for people from their superiors, believing that "there can be no Great Leap Forward without increasing people," and "more people do more things, fewer people do fewer things." At the beginning, the city leaders also favored recruiting new workers from the countryside. However, agriculture is also undergoing a Great Leap Forward, and the path of relying solely on the countryside is not feasible. The result of labor cooperation with Yuci Special Zone in February was that, despite thinking of many ways and expanding the scope of labor allocation from six counties to nine counties, only 10,000 person-times could be transferred from the countryside. Where would the remaining 10,000+ laborers come from? The situation was pressing, and the city leaders began to shift to tapping potential from within enterprises and the city itself. In early March, the Municipal People's Committee conducted a thorough investigation of the labor situation in various enterprises in the city and found that there was great potential to be tapped within enterprises, and also found that many units could still achieve a Great Leap Forward with fewer people, and that there were many good ways to solve the shortage of labor. The city leaders summarized these experiences and, at the same time, conducted a thorough analysis of the social forces in the city, and proposed ten measures to tap the potential of labor. In mid-April, a labor balance and cooperation conference was held, which once again criticized the erroneous ideas of "more people can do more things," "fewer people cannot achieve a Great Leap Forward," and departmentalism, while exchanging experiences in tapping labor potential. After everyone's discussion, the ten measures for tapping labor potential were increased to twelve measures.
    1. Adjusting labor organization and promoting mixed work teams and comprehensive coal mining teams can save more than 870 laborers.
    2. Advocating that one person learns multiple technologies and that everyone becomes a master of all trades, with two people doing the work of three, can save more than 470 people.
    3. Organizing labor allocation and cooperation among enterprises. Units that need temporary labor and units that are temporarily idle should report to the Labor Bureau at any time, regardless of the number, and the Labor Bureau will promptly allocate mutual support. In the first quarter, the city has mutually allocated 500 person-times.
    4. Promoting technological reform, vigorously improving tools, and replacing manual labor with machinery can free labor from heavy physical labor. It is estimated that the city can save nearly 1,000 laborers.
    5. Streamlining non-production personnel, odd-job personnel, tea stove workers, guards, gatekeepers, etc. can be greatly reduced, and some work can be replaced by cadres participating in physical labor, which can reduce more than 700 people in the city.
    6. Improving attendance rates and streamlining non-quota personnel. In the past, due to low attendance rates, many production teams and groups had many over-quota personnel. If the attendance rate can reach 90%, the city can streamline more than 400 people.
    7. Supporting the initiatives of capital construction workers to change the big weekend, etc., can relatively increase more than 1,150 people.
    8. Widely organizing scattered urban laborers and urban residents to participate in production. The neighborhood committees organize residents with labor ability and work requirements, contract with enterprises for earthwork, gravel, and transportation of raw materials and finished products, etc.; there is no limit to labor time, and half-day or full-day labor is acceptable, and wages are distributed according to labor efficiency. At present, hundreds of citizens have signed up, and many streets are preparing to set up nurseries and sign mutual assistance contracts for housework in order to allow more male and female citizens to participate in labor. The most conservative estimate is that more than 1,500 organized citizens can regularly participate in labor.
    9. Incorporating the work-study programs of various secondary schools into the city's labor plan. More than 3,000 middle school students in the city can participate in four hours of labor every day on average. The schools separately sign contracts with enterprises that lack labor, and adopt the method of contracting to allow students to participate in labor. As of April 4, the city's two middle schools had already completed more than 6,300 labor days.
    10. Replacing the old with the young and women with men, and rationally using labor. The Yangquan Municipal People's Committee has issued a notice that young and middle-aged odd-job personnel in various units can sign up to become workers, and odd-job work will be undertaken by older people with poor physical strength or by absorbing women. At present, more than 100 people have signed up.
    11. Organizing family members of employees to participate in coal picking, packaging products, and other work is expected to replace more than 640 laborers in the city.
    12. Utilizing various criminals who can participate in labor to participate in labor.
    Now that these twelve measures have all begun to be implemented, a total of 10,000 laborers have been excavated, basically solving the city's labor shortage.

### 工业生产大跃进　人力不足怎么办？  就地挖潜力——阳泉的路走对了

    工业生产大跃进　人力不足怎么办？
    就地挖潜力——阳泉的路走对了
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：在工业生产大跃进中，如何解决劳动力不足的困难？阳泉市采取了十二项措施，挖掘出了一万个劳动力，基本上解决了今年劳动力不足的困难。
    按照跃进计划，阳泉市今年的工业总产值比去年增加了66.05％，基本建设投资增加了近一倍，有十余个较大的企业要进行扩建，有数十个新建厂矿要投入生产。按照这个计划，全市需要增加两万多个劳动力。这个数字等于全市现有工人总数的三分之二还多。怎样解决这个困难呢？有些企业是伸手向上级要人，认为“不增加人就不能跃进”，“人多多办事，人少少办事”。市领导上开始时也偏重于从农村招收新工人。但是农业也在大跃进，单纯依靠农村的路子走不通，2月份和榆次专区进行劳力协作的结果，尽管想了许多办法，把劳力调配范围由六个县扩大到了九个县，也只能从农村调进一万人次。其余的一万多个劳动力从哪里来呢？形势逼人，市领导上开始转向从企业内部和城市本身去挖掘潜力。3月上旬，市人民委员会对全市各企业的劳动力情况进行了摸底，发现企业内部的劳动力有很大的潜力可挖，而且发现不少单位人少同样也能跃进，有许多解决劳动力不足的好办法。市领导上总结了这些经验，同时对全市的社会力量进行了摸底分析，提出了挖掘劳动力潜力的十大措施。4月中旬，召开了劳动力平衡协作会议，再次批判了“人多好办事”，“人少不能跃进”和本位主义等错误思想，同时交流了挖掘劳动潜力的经验。经过大家讨论，把挖掘劳动力潜力的十项措施增加为十二项措施。
    一、调整劳动组织，推行混合工作队、综合采煤队，可以节省劳动力八百七十余名。
    二、提倡一人学会多种技术，人人学成全把式，两个人做三个人的活。可以节省四百七十余人。
    三、组织各企业之间的劳动力调配与协作。临时用人的单位和临时窝工的单位，不管数字大小随时报告劳动局，由劳动局及时调拨互相支援。第一季度全市已经互相调配劳动力五百人次。
    四、推行技术改革，大力改进工具，以机械代人工，把劳动力从重体力劳动中解放出来。预计全市可以节省劳动力近一千人。
    五、精简非生产人员、勤杂人员、茶炉工、警卫人员、门房管理员等，可以大大缩减，有些工作由干部参加体力劳动来代替，全市可以减少七百余人。
    六、提高出勤率，精简非定额人员。过去因为出勤率低，许多生产队、组有许多超定额人员，如果出勤率能达到90％，全市即可精简四百余人。
    七、支持基本建设工人提出的改大礼拜等倡议，可以相对地增加一千一百五十余人。
    八、广泛组织城市分散劳动力和城市居民参加生产。由居民委员会把有劳动能力而又有工作要求的居民组织起来，给企业包工、挖土方、打石子、运搬原料和成品等；没有劳动时间的限制，半日或全日劳动都可以，按劳动效率分工资。目前，报名的市民已有数百人，许多街道正筹办托儿所、订立家务互助合同，以便让更多的男女市民参加劳动。最保守的估计，全市可以有一千五百余名有组织的市民经常参加劳动。
    九、把各中等学校的勤工俭学计划，纳入全市的劳动计划中。全市三千余名中学生，每天平均有四百人可以参加四小时劳动。由各学校分别和缺少劳动力的企业订立合同，采取包工的办法让学生参加劳动。截至4月4日，全市的两座中学，已经做了六千三百余个劳动日。
    十、老换少、女换男，合理使用劳动力。阳泉市人民委员会已发出通知，各单位的青壮年勤杂人员，可以报名当工人，勤杂工作一律由年纪较大、体力较差的人或吸收妇女来担任。目前报名的已达一百余人。
    十一、组织职工家属参加拣煤、包装产品等工作，预计全市可以顶替出劳动力六百四十余人。
    十二、利用可能参加劳动的各种犯人参加劳动。
    现在这十二项措施已经全部开始推行，总共挖掘出一万个劳动力，基本上解决了全市劳力不足的困难。
