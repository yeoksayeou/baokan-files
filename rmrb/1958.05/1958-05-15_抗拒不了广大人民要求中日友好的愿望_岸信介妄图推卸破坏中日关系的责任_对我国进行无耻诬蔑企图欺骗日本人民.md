Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th. After Nobusuke Kishi's subservience to the US-Chiang clique and his hostile attitude towards China met with China's stern condemnation, Nobusuke Kishi's true colors were exposed, and he was extremely embarrassed. This prime minister then hurriedly resorted to double-dealing tactics, portraying himself as an active "supporter" of promoting Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade, while at the same time making all kinds of shameless slanders against China, attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade onto China, in order to confuse right and wrong, incite anti-China sentiment, and deceive the Japanese people.

After the publication of Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi's talk on Sino-Japanese relations, Nobusuke Kishi hurriedly urged leading cadres of the Foreign Ministry to hold a meeting on the morning of the 10th to discuss countermeasures, and spread various fallacies in the form of "unofficial opinions" of the Foreign Ministry. In this "unofficial opinion," the Kishi government was heavily promoted as having taken "possible measures" such as trade and cultural exchanges with China within the scope of not recognizing China as a basic policy, and the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement was "also taking realistic and reasonable measures within the scope of promoting trade as much as possible." It also listed the Kishi cabinet's "resolution" of the fingerprint issue that the Hatoyama cabinet and the Ishibashi cabinet had failed to resolve, and the stipulation in the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement that private business representative offices would be established, as "proof" of the Kishi cabinet's "enthusiasm" for "promoting" trade and friendly relations with China.

Japanese Foreign Ministry experts have racked their brains to falsely report Nobusuke Kishi's "achievements" in "promoting" Sino-Japanese relations. While the method is laughable, its malicious intentions must be exposed. Promoting Sino-Japanese trade and friendly relations between the two countries is the ardent desire of the vast number of Japanese people and an irresistible trend. Although Nobusuke Kishi is full of hostility towards China in his bones, he still wants to steal this attractive banner in the general election to win votes.

However, facts are the best witness. Facts show that Nobusuke Kishi has done nothing but bad things on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations since he came to power more than a year ago, and this is his contribution to the United States. Indeed, in recent years, Sino-Japanese economic, cultural, and friendly ties have greatly developed, but this is the result of the efforts of the people of China and Japan, and this effort has been actively supported by the Chinese government. Nobusuke Kishi not only did not support it, but also sabotaged it in many ways. The recent crime was sabotaging the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Talking about the fingerprint issue, everyone knows that this is the result of the long-term efforts of people from all walks of life in Japan to seek a solution. However, Nobusuke Kishi did not oppose Japan making the same modification until last year when the United States revised the regulation that foreigners entering the country and staying for more than sixty days must have their fingerprints taken to staying for more than one year. But this does not mean that the so-called fingerprint law no longer exists, but it has only been extended from two months to one year, and the problem of permanent residence of Chinese business representatives in Japan to carry out trade business has not been resolved. Therefore, this so-called "solution to the fingerprint problem" is nothing more than a clumsy deception. Regarding the issue of mutual establishment of business representative offices, Nobusuke Kishi has always been opposed to it. One of the main purposes of the so-called four "understandings" put forward by Nobusuke Kishi during the negotiation and conclusion of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement between China and Japan was to obstruct and sabotage the mutual establishment of business representative offices. After China and Japan signed the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, which included provisions for the mutual establishment of business representative offices, after great efforts, Nobusuke Kishi not only opposed the right of the Chinese business representative office to fly the Chinese national flag, and refused to guarantee the safety and convenience of the office and its staff, but even fundamentally overturned the fourth Sino Japanese trade agreement. The third Sino-Japanese trade agreement concluded in May 1955 was supported at the time by the then Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama. This alone is enough to show what role Nobusuke Kishi is playing in Sino-Japanese relations.

Another intention of Nobusuke Kishi in expressing his "achievements" in "promoting" Sino-Japanese relations through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to attempt to shirk his responsibility for sabotaging Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade, slander China, and further sabotage Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade. The "unofficial opinion" of the Foreign Ministry said that the Chinese side said, "If the national flag issue is not resolved, Sino-Japanese trade cannot be carried out." Japan believes that "If events that are not directly related to trade are used to condemn, it will make people doubt whether they are truly sincere in promoting trade." This kind of deliberate slander against China by the Japanese Foreign Ministry is the same as Nobusuke Kishi's argument of "separating trade from politics." China's sincerity in carrying out Sino-Japanese trade has long been unanimously recognized by a wide range of Japanese sectors, including business people. This is a fact that cannot be destroyed by any slanderous remarks from the Nobusuke Kishi group. However, under the circumstances that Nobusuke Kishi has taken a series of anti-China atrocities, including condoning thugs tearing down the Chinese national flag, the conditions for carrying out Sino-Japanese trade have been undermined. After condoning the thugs to insult the Chinese national flag, Nobusuke Kishi shamelessly said, "Only the Chinese national flag was taken down, not damaged," "If the Chinese are angry because the national flag is insulted, then it is best not to hang the national flag." He even said that Japan cannot recognize the national flag of the People's Republic of China as the Chinese national flag. Nobusuke Kishi's words and deeds of insulting the People's Republic of China with an imperialist attitude are deliberately provoking the Chinese people, and are a method of sabotaging Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade, as well as a way of pleasing the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The Nobusuke Kishi group spread slanderous propaganda everywhere, saying that China's accusation against Nobusuke Kishi during the Japanese general election period has "political purposes," is "to alienate the government from the people," and "interfere in Japan's internal affairs," and so on. In fact, Nobusuke Kishi's reversal of black and white does have his political purposes. Everyone knows that the time of the Japanese general election is not determined by others, but by the Nobusuke Kishi group itself. It was Nobusuke Kishi himself who chose such a time to completely sabotage the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement and condone and protect the thugs who insulted the Chinese national flag during the general election. Nobusuke Kishi chose such a time to openly be hostile to our country precisely to please the United States and want to get its strong support in the general election. It is only natural that his behavior of undermining Sino-Japanese relations in order to gain election capital has been countered by the Chinese side. Therefore, there is no issue of China "choosing" the Japanese general election as an opportunity, and there is no issue of China "interfering in Japan's internal affairs." It is Nobusuke Kishi, not China, who is trying to achieve political goals by taking advantage of the general election. However, this time Nobusuke Kishi shot himself in the foot and then wanted to bite China back.

Another purpose of Nobusuke Kishi's various slanders mentioned above is to attempt to use these slanders to deceive and incite some Japanese people who have vague understanding or are unaware of the essence of the issue to be dissatisfied with China, so that they will turn to support Nobusuke Kishi and the Liberal Democratic Party in the general election, and facilitate the Liberal Democratic Party to defraud more seats in the general election. However, Nobusuke Kishi's plot is being seen through by more and more Japanese people.

According to a Kyodo News report on the 11th on the election situation in the Kansai region centered on Osaka, the Sino-Japanese trade issue has become a matter of great concern to voters in Kansai. "You cannot conduct election activities in the Kansai region without discussing this issue." A Socialist candidate pointed out that "The Kishi cabinet is very cunning. It wants to implement the 'appropriate utilization' that it cannot do itself—making money in Beijing and diplomatic relations in Taipei." He said, "The fundamental issue is to immediately recognize China." Kyodo News said that his opinion "resonates with quite a few people." On the other hand, although Liberal Democratic Party candidates can take advantage of the vague understanding of some voters, their situation is still "seems very difficult." A certain candidate of the Liberal Democratic Party who made a splash in the last general election by using Sino-Japanese trade as an attractive slogan, this time "took great pains" to explain the Kishi cabinet's sabotage of the Japan-China trade agreement. He told voters: "I will work hard to ensure that (Japan's) trade with China can be carried out in the near future." According to Kyodo News, this candidate probably felt that it was not powerful enough to say this alone, so he also published some opinions that were "similar" to the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party. He admitted that Nobusuke Kishi's "so-called trade can be carried out without a national flag is too much." He said: "China should be admitted to the United Nations." He asked voters: "How about setting aside the government and having civil society groups issue a Japan-China peace declaration?" Kyodo News said that this remark by the Liberal Democratic Party candidate "was strongly ridiculed by workers and students."

　　抗拒不了广大人民要求中日友好的愿望
　　岸信介妄图推卸破坏中日关系的责任
　　对我国进行无耻诬蔑企图欺骗日本人民
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：在岸信介屈从美蒋、敌视中国的作法遭到中国严正的斥责以后，岸信介面目暴露，十分狼狈。这位首相又慌忙耍起两面三刀的手法，把自己说成是对促进中日关系和中日贸易的积极“支持者”，同时对中国进行种种无耻的诬蔑，妄图把破坏中日关系和中日贸易的责任推到中国身上，以混淆是非，煽动反对中国的情绪，欺骗日本人民。
    在中国副总理兼外交部长陈毅关于中日关系的谈话发表以后，岸信介急忙催促外务省领导干部在10日上午举行会议商量对策，并且以外务省的“非正式意见”的方式散布各种谬论。在这个
  “非正式意见”中，大肆宣传岸信介政府在不能承认中国这个基本方针的范围以内，一直采取了同中国进行贸易和文化交流等“可能采取的措施”，并且对第四次中日贸易协定“也尽可能地在促进贸易的范围内采取了现实而合理的措施”。它还列举了岸信介内阁“解决了”鸠山内阁和石桥内阁都未能解决的指纹问题以及在第四次中日贸易协定规定了设置民间商务代表机构这两件事情，作为岸信介内阁“热心”于“促进”同中国进行贸易和友好相处的工作的“证明”。
    日本外务省的专家们绞尽脑汁为岸信介虚报在“促进”中日关系的工作中的“功劳”，作法固然可笑，但其用心恶毒，则是必须加以揭发的。促进中日贸易和中日两国友好相处是日本广大人民的热烈要求，是一股不可抗拒的潮流。尽管岸信介在骨子里充满了对中国的敌视，但是，他还想在大选中窃取这面吸引人的旗子，骗取选票。
    然而，事实是最好的见证人。事实说明，岸信介上台一年多以来，在中日关系问题上是坏事做尽，这是他对美国的功劳。的确，这几年来中日两国在经济、文化和友好联系方面有了很大的发展，但是，这是中日两国人民努力的结果，这种努力受到了中国政府的积极支持。岸信介不仅不加以支持，并且多方破坏，最近的罪行就是破坏第四次中日贸易协定。谈到按指纹的问题，大家知道，这是日本各界人士长期努力谋求解决的结果。而岸信介一直拖到去年美国把外国人入境停留六十天以后要按指纹的规定修改为停留一年以上者要按指纹以后，才不再反对日本作同样的修改。但是这并不等于所谓指纹法已经不存在，不过是由两个月延长到一年而已，还是没有解决中国商务代表机构人员常驻日本执行贸易业务的问题。因此，这所谓“指纹问题的解决”，无非是一个拙劣的骗局。关于互设商务代表机构的问题，岸信介自始就是反对的，岸信介在中日有关双方谈判缔结第四次中日贸易协定的期间提出的所谓四条“谅解事项”，主要目的之一就是阻挠和破坏互设商务代表机构。而中日有关双方经过极大的努力签订了包括规定互设商务代表机构的第四次中日贸易协定以后，岸信介不仅反对中国商务代表机构悬挂中国国旗的权利，拒绝保证这个机构及其所属人员的安全和工作方便，甚至从根本上推翻第四次中日贸易协定。而在1955年5月缔结的第三次中日贸易协定却是得到过当时的日本首相鸠山一郎的支持的。只此一端就足以说明，岸信介在中日关系上所起的是什么作用。
    岸信介通过外务省表白他在“促进”中日关系上的“功劳”的另一方面的用意，是企图推卸他的破坏中日关系和中日贸易的责任，诬赖中国，借此进一步破坏中日关系和中日贸易。外务省的“非正式意见”中说，中国方面说，“如果国旗问题得不到解决，就不能进行中日贸易”，日本认为，“假如提出同贸易没有直接关系的事件来加以谴责，那就会使人怀疑是否对促进贸易真正抱有诚意。”日本外务省这种故意中伤中国的论调，是和岸信介的“把贸易和政治分开”的论调出于一辙的。中国对进行中日贸易的诚意早已为包括企业界人士在内的日本广泛阶层所一致公认，这是岸信介集团的任何中伤言论所破坏不了的事实。但是，在岸信介采取包括纵容暴徒扯下中国国旗在内的一系列敌视中国的暴行的情况下，进行中日贸易的条件已经遭到破坏。岸信介在纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗之后，居然无耻地说，“只是取下中国国旗，并未损毁”，“如果中国人因为国旗被侮辱而生气，那末最好就不要悬挂国旗”。他甚至还表示日本不能承认中华人民共和国的国旗是中国国旗。岸信介的这种以帝国主义态度侮辱中华人民共和国的言行，是蓄意向中国人民挑衅，是破坏中日关系和中日贸易的一种手法，也是讨好美国和蒋介石集团的一种做法。
    岸信介集团到处散布污蔑宣传，说什么中国趁日本大选期间这样指责岸信介是有“政治目的”，是为了“要离间政府与人民”，“干涉日本内政”等等。其实，岸信介这样颠倒黑白，倒的确有他的政治目的。谁都知道，日本大选的时间并不是别人决定的，而是由岸信介集团自己决定的。选择在大选这样一个时机彻底破坏第四次中日贸易协定、纵容和包庇暴徒侮辱中国国旗的也不是别人，而是岸信介自己。岸信介选择这样一个时机公开敌视我国，正是为了讨好美国，想在大选中得到它的大力支援。他这种为了捞取竞选资本，不惜损害中日关系的行为遭到中国方面的反击，那是很自然的。因此，并不存在中国“选择”日本大选为时机的问题，更不存在中国“干涉日本内政”的问题，利用大选时机企图达到政治目的正是岸信介而不是中国。不过，这次岸信介弄巧成拙，搬石头压了自己的脚，然后又想反咬中国一口罢了。
    岸信介进行上述种种污蔑的另一个目的，是企图用这些污蔑来欺骗和煽动一部分认识模糊或是不明问题实质的日本人对中国不满，使他们在大选中转而支持岸信介和自由民主党，便利自由民主党在大选中骗取更多的议席。但是，岸信介的这种图谋正在被越来越多的日本人民看穿。
    据共同社11日报道以大阪为中心的关西地方的竞选情况时透露，目前中日贸易问题已经成为关西选民非常关心的事情，“在关西地方不谈论这个问题，就不能进行竞选活动”。一个社会党候选人指出，“岸内阁很狡猾。它想实行自己做也做不到的‘适当利用’——赚钱在北京，外交关系在台北。”他说，“根本问题是立即承认中国。”共同社说，他的意见“得到相当多的人的共鸣”。另一方面，自由民主党的候选人虽然可以利用某些选民的认识模糊，但是他们的处境还是“好像很艰苦”。在上次大选中把中日贸易作为吸引人的口号出了风头的自由民主党的某候选人，这次为了对岸信介内阁破坏日中贸易协定问题进行解释，“煞费苦心”。他对选民说：“我要努力使（日本）同中国的贸易能够在最近进行。”据共同社说，这位候选人大概是觉得光是这样说还嫌没有力量，于是他又发表一些“类似”日本社会党和共产党的意见。他承认，岸信介的“所谓没有国旗也能进行贸易的话是说得过分了”。他说：“应当接纳中国进入联合国”，他问选民：“把政府抛开，光由民间团体发表日中和平宣言怎样？”。共同社说，自由民主党这位候选人的这番话“受到了劳动人民和学生的强烈的嘲笑”。
