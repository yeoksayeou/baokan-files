　　Water Pestles and Waterwheels Transformed into Hydropower Stations

　　(Our report) Xingning County, Guangdong Province, is promoting the experience of Huangpi Township and Yonghe Township in mountainous and hilly areas to transform water pestles and waterwheels into small hydropower stations, aiming to achieve hydropower in mountainous areas before the end of May. The Sanxi Agricultural Cooperative in Huangpi Township uses a hydropower station rebuilt from a water pestle, installing seventy electric lights. This hydropower station is also a versatile hydraulic processing plant. Its water turbine can simultaneously drive eight kinds of processing tools, including a water pestle, water mill, water grinder, seedling cutter, slicer, fertilizer mixing barrel, windmill, and bamboo sieve. The total equipment cost for the hydropower station is only over 600 yuan. Xingning County currently has 142 water pestles and waterwheels. Adding more than 200 new ones built using old dikes, the mountainous area will have 356 small hydropower stations.

　　According to calculations by industrial departments, water pestles and waterwheels can generally be converted into 2 to 10 horsepower water turbines. (Note: Pestle - a tool used in rural southern China for pounding rice and making paper pulp, some are powered by water, others are foot-operated.)

　　水碓、水车变成了水电站
    本报讯　广东兴宁县在山区和丘陵区推广黄陂乡和永和乡的经验，把水碓、水车变成小型水电站，在5月底以前实现山区水电化。黄陂乡三溪农业社利用水碓改建的水电站，装七十盏电灯。这个水电站又是一个万能水力加工厂，它的水轮机可以同时带动水碓、水磨、水研、切苗机、切片机、制肥桶、风车和竹筛等八种加工工具。水电站的全部装备费用才六百多元。兴宁县现有水碓、水车一百四十二个，加上利用旧陂头新建二百多个，就可使山区有三百五十六个小型水电站。
    据工业部门计算，水碓、水车一般可以改成二到十马力的水轮机。（注：碓——是南方农村用来舂米、做纸浆的工具，有的用水作动力，有的用脚蹬。）
