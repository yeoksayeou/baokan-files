　　"Neues Deutschland" Publishes Article Pointing Out That the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is Incompatible with Marxism
　　It Openly Promotes Revisionism and Provides Cover for the Enemy
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – The following is a summary received here of a lengthy article by Georg Hansen, a member of the editorial board of "Neues Deutschland," published on the 10th, commenting on the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The article is titled "Incompatible with Marxism-Leninism."
　　The article dedicated a significant amount of space to commenting on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The author asked: "For what reason did the leading bodies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia put forward such a program that serves the camp opposing the Marxist-Leninist policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other communist and workers' parties? For what reason, in the current stage of international development, precisely when it is necessary to use all forces to oppose the common enemy, the atomic war politicians of the North Atlantic Treaty, is it providing cover for the enemy? The leading bodies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are clearly moving in the opposite direction. Do they not see that the atomic war policy of the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty is the main danger? Where do the leading bodies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia want to go?"
　　The article stated, "The draft program believes that the existence of two military blocs—the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty—is the cause of world tension, but it does not emphasize the fundamentally different reasons for and goals of these two treaties." The article argued that the draft program’s explanation of the reasons for the emergence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization provides ammunition for the "psychological warfare" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
　　The article then discussed a recurring argument in the draft program, namely that a process of capitalism gradually growing into socialism is currently emerging in various capitalist countries. The article stated that this argument was advocated by the British Fabian Society and Bernstein. "One cannot help but get the impression that the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia wants to please everyone. For example, liberal professors of the American bourgeoisie can completely use the above program to support their arguments about people's capitalism."
　　The article, in criticizing the draft program’s revision of Marxist state theory, wrote that the view that the capitalist system itself will automatically lead to the socialist system, "without going through the decisive stage of the working class seizing power," runs like a red thread through the entire section of the draft program on modern capitalism. The article argued that although some words negating the theory of automatic transition to socialism were added to this section, these words do not change the essence of the erroneous arguments in the entire section.
　　The article stated that instead of the clear and unambiguous definitions of the struggle for seizing power, destroying the state apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat given by Marx, Engels, and Lenin, what appears here is another formulation that can be interpreted by both the revisionist leaders in the workers' movement and the bourgeois liberals according to their own opinions. According to Kardelj, the working class can obtain its political power in a relatively long evolutionary process and gradually use part of the bourgeois state apparatus to serve itself. This is contrary to the lessons Marx drew from the Paris Commune and what Lenin said in "State and Revolution." Disarming the bourgeoisie in revolutionary action and completely depriving the bourgeoisie of its power remains the foremost prerequisite for establishing the power of the working class. Anyone who intends to achieve this in an evolutionary process will soon see that the ruling class will thereby gain ample time and opportunity to reorganize and strengthen their armed forces.
　　Regarding the issue of denying the leading role of workers' parties, the article stated: "The draft program attempts, in an extremely arrogant manner, to point out to communist parties of all countries that they have ‘no monopoly on the socialist development of society.’ Here, the leading role of the working-class party in the struggle to seize power and build socialism is simply denied. Unfortunately, Kardelj and others have not responded to the criticisms raised against this argument." The article asked: Which parties and organizations would attack the Communist Party’s "monopoly"? Is it the leadership of the American trade unions? Is it reformist leaders like the leaders of the British Labour Party? Or even those liberal professors? The article stated that Tito himself unintentionally refuted the absurdity of this part of the draft program. According to Tito, the leaders of the reformists are trying to re-implement capitalism in Yugoslavia. So, can people expect these leaders to seriously fight for socialism in their own countries? The article pointed out that although the Yugoslav leaders later attempted to delete and supplement certain sentences, the draft program still showed no true spirit of fraternal relations between socialist countries.
　　The article forcefully pointed out: The statement that certain socialist countries or people may also conduct economic exploitation of other socialist countries or people in the initial stage of socialist development is the most absurd part of the draft program. The article pointed out that the basic prerequisite for the final victory of the world working class is the ideological and political unity of communist and workers' parties. This unity has been manifested in the Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries. However, the draft program proposed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a welcome tool for all reactionary forces. "Reactionary forces are doing their utmost to create unrest and confusion in the ranks of the world workers' movement."
　　When discussing Yugoslavia’s economic policy, the article wrote: "The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that ‘Yugoslavia’s path to socialism’ is the best of all paths. A completely unbiased person reading their fairly extensive program would also be surprised that Yugoslavia's most pressing economic problems receive little attention." "At the Ljubljana Congress, even the figures for the implementation of the 1957-1961 five-year plan were not mentioned." After listing some serious problems existing in Yugoslavia's industry and agriculture, the article pointed out that the working people of Yugoslavia still need to make great efforts to reach a production level commensurate with the socialist social system.
　　The article said: "The leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is trying to alleviate its economic difficulties by requesting loans from the United States, but loans from capitalist countries do not come without political influence on Belgrade."
　　The article concluded that, in short, the discussion of the program at the Ljubljana Congress was an open promotion of revisionism, which is contrary to the Marxist-Leninist declarations issued by communist and workers' parties of socialist countries. The revisionism of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will hinder the socialist development of Yugoslavia and at the same time promote social-democratic ideas in capitalist countries. The draft program adopted at the Ljubljana Congress will absolutely not be beneficial to the people of all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, and in particular, the enemies of peace will use it against the forces of peace.

　　“新德意志报”发表文章指出
　　南共纲领同马克思主义不相容
    它公开宣扬修正主义并且替敌人打掩护
    新华社北京13日讯　这里收到了“新德意志报”10日刊载的该报编辑委员会委员格奥尔格·汉森写的评论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的长文章的摘要。文章标题是“同马克思列宁主义不相容”。
    文章用了很大的篇幅评论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案。文章作者问道：“南共的领导机构是出于何种原因提出了这样一个为反对苏联共产党和其他共产党、工人党的马克思列宁主义政策的营垒服务的纲领呢？它是出于何种原因要在目前的国际发展阶段中、即正当需要用一切力量来反对共同敌人、反对北大西洋公约的原子战争政客们的时候，替敌人打掩护呢？南共的领导机构显然是走上了相反的方向。它难道没有看到美国和北大西洋公约的原子战争政策是主要危险吗？南共的领导机构要往何处去呢？”
    文章说，“纲领草案认为两个军事集团——北大西洋公约和华沙防御条约——的存在是造成世界紧张局势的原因，但是没有强调指明这两个条约的截然不同的产生原因和目标。”文章认为，南共纲领中关于北大西洋集团产生的原因的说法是替北大西洋公约集团从事“心理战”提供了弹药。
    文章接着谈到在纲领草案中多次重复的一个论点，即在各资本主义国家中目前正在出现促使资本主义逐渐长入社会主义的过程。文章说，这种论点是英国费边学社以及伯恩斯坦所主张过的。“人们不能不由此获得这样的印象：南共的领导是想讨好所有的人，譬如美国资产阶级自由派的教授们就完全可以拿上述纲领来支持自己关于人民资本主义的论点。”
    文章在批判纲领草案对马克思主义国家学说的修正时写道，认为资本主义制度本身会自动导致社会主义制度，而“不必经过由工人阶级夺取政权的这个决定性阶段”的看法就像一根红线似地贯穿着纲领草案中整个关于现代资本主义的那一部分。文章认为，尽管在这一段里添上了一些否定自动过渡到社会主义的理论的词句，但是这些词句并不能改变整个这一部分的错误论点的实质。
    文章说，代替马克思、恩格斯、列宁对夺取政权的斗争、毁灭资产阶级的国家机构和建立无产阶级专政所下的清楚明确的定义，在这里出现的却是另外一种提法，这种提法既可以被工人运动中的修正主义领袖、又可以被资产阶级的自由主义者按照他们的意见来作解释。依照卡德尔的说法，工人阶级可以在一个较长的进化过程中获得它的政治权力，并且可以逐步地使资产阶级国家机构的一部分来为自己服务，这是同马克思就巴黎公社所取得的教训和列宁在“国家与革命”中所说的话正相违反的。在革命行动中解除资产阶级的武装和全部剥夺资产阶级的权力，这仍然是建立工人阶级政权的最先决的条件。谁要是打算在进化过程中来实现这一点，谁就会很快地看到统治阶级会由此而获得充分的时间和机会来改组和加强他们的武装力量。
    关于否认工人政党的领导作用问题，文章说：“纲领草案以极其傲慢的方式企图向各国共产党指明它们对‘社会的社会主义发展没有垄断权’，这里干脆否定了工人阶级政党在夺取政权和建设社会主义的斗争中的领导作用。遗憾的是，卡德尔和其他的人都没有就对于这个论点所提出的批评作出回答。”文章问道：是哪一些党和组织会攻击共产党的这种“垄断”呢？是美国的工会领导机构吗？是像英国工党领袖们那样的改良主义者领袖吗？或者甚至是那些自由主义的教授们吗？文章说，正是铁托自己完全无意地反证了纲领草案这一部分的荒谬性。按照铁托的话，改良主义者的领袖们力图在南斯拉夫重新实现资本主义。那么，难道人们能够期望这些领袖们会在他们自己的国家里认真地为社会主义而斗争吗？文章指出，尽管南斯拉夫领导人后来曾试图对某些词句作了删改和补充，但是纲领草案仍然丝毫没有表明社会主义各国间兄弟关系的真正精神。
    文章有力地指出：关于在社会主义发展的最初阶段某些社会主义国家或人民也可能对其它社会主义国家或人民进行经济剥削的说法，是纲领草案中最荒谬的一部分。文章指出，世界工人阶级最后胜利的基本前提是共产党和工人党思想上和政治上的团结一致。这种团结一致已经表现在社会主义国家共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言以及和平宣言里。可是南共所提出的纲领草案对一切反动势力来说却是一个值得欢迎的工具。“反动势力是竭力要在世界工人运动行列中制造不安和混乱的”。
    文章在谈到南斯拉夫的经济政策问题时写道：“南共的领袖们相信‘南斯拉夫走向社会主义的道路’是所有道路中最好的一条。一个完全没有偏见的人在读了他们的范围相当广泛的纲领之后也会感到奇怪，何以南斯拉夫的最迫切的经济问题却较少受到注意。”“在卢布尔雅那的代表大会上连关于1957—1961年的五年计划执行情况的数字都没有提到”。文章在列举了南斯拉夫工农业中存在的一些严重问题后指出，南斯拉夫劳动人民为了达到同社会主义社会制度相称的生产水平还需要作巨大的努力。
    文章说：“南共领导集团试图通过向美国请求贷款来减轻其经济困难，但是资本主义国家的贷款对贝尔格莱德是不无政治影响的。”
    文章最后指出，总之，卢布尔雅那代表大会上对纲领进行的讨论是公开宣扬修正主义，同社会主义各国共产党和工人党所发表的马克思列宁主义的宣言正相违背。南共领导集团的修正主义会阻碍南斯拉夫的社会主义发展，同时会助长资本主义国家的社会民主思想。卢布尔雅那代表大会上通过的纲领草案对于南斯拉夫各族人民来说绝对不会有什么好处，特别是和平的敌人将会利用它来反对和平力量。
