　　Lu Xun attached great importance to children's books, and he also paid attention to pictures for children. He said: "Children are admirable. They often think of realms beyond the stars and moon, of situations beneath the ground, of the uses of flowers, and of the languages of insects; they want to fly into the sky, they want to dive into ant nests... Therefore, books for children must be very carefully considered, and making them is very difficult." ("Qiejieting Essays," People's Literature Publishing House, page 37)

　　This passage is worth remembering forever by those who write and paint for children.

　　Children like "narration" in painting; children's paintings are a form of visualized "story." Therefore, if we are to create paintings for children, to create paintings suitable for children to appreciate, it is appropriate to select story paintings with content to narrate. In detail, paintings that are merely beautiful in shape, color, lines, and brushwork, but simple, lacking, and empty in content, such as Western European Impressionist paintings depicting a few haystacks or a patch of water light and a few water lilies, are of no interest to children and are also of no benefit to them. Conversely, paintings that are beautiful in shape and color, and also rich in content, such as Repin's "Unexpected Return" and Reshetnikov's "Another Two," are of interest to children and beneficial to them. Broadly speaking, a painting does not necessarily have to tell a story, as long as it does not focus solely on form but "has something to say," it is a painting that children love and is of educational significance.

　　In China's thousands of years of history, there are many respectable and lovable heroic figures and moving deeds, many of which are understandable to children and have educational significance as painting materials. Especially in the vigorous War of Liberation, countless heroic deeds, such as those of Liu Zhidan, Liu Hulan, and Huang Jiguang, that are worth singing and weeping over, and in the brilliant and splendid socialist construction, the surprising and delightful new atmospheres and new figures emerging in all aspects of industry and agriculture, all need painters to select and create works for children to see. In terms of fables and fairy tales, we also have many in China. To give the most common examples, such as the snipe and clam fighting, the foolish old man moving mountains, waiting for a rabbit to fall into a trap, and Mr. Zhongshan Wolf, are all of interest to children and are good subjects for children to appreciate paintings. In short, regardless of ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, any story whose content and meaning conforms to children's five loves—love of the motherland, love of the people, love of labor, love of science, and love of public property—can be created into various forms of art works to supply the vast number of children to appreciate.

　　Painters, create more works for children!

    为儿童作画
    丰子恺
    鲁迅先生是很重视儿童读物的，他也很注意给儿童看的图画。他说过：“孩子是可以敬服的，他常常想到星月以上的境界，想到地面下的情形，想到花卉的用处，想到昆虫的言语；他想飞上天空，他想潜入蚁穴……所以给儿童看的图书就必须十分慎重，做起来也十分烦难。”（“且介亭杂文”人民文学出版社，第三十七页）
    这段话是值得为孩子们写书作画的人永远记住的。
    儿童对绘画喜欢“叙述”；儿童画是一种形象化的“故事”。所以我们要替儿童作画，要创作适于儿童欣赏的绘画，宜乎选取有内容可叙述的故事画。详言之，仅乎形状、色彩、线条、笔法很美丽，而内容简单、贫乏、虚空，例如西欧印象派之类的绘画，描写几个稻草堆或一片水光和几朵睡莲的绘画，是儿童所不感兴味的，同时也是对他们没有益处的。反之，形状色彩很美丽，同时内容又很丰富，例如列宾的“不期而至”、列舍特尼科夫的“又是一个两分”等，才是儿童所感兴味而对他们有益处的绘画。广义地说，绘画不一定要有一个故事，只要不专讲形式而“言之有物”，都是儿童所喜爱而富有教育意义的绘画。
    在我国数千年的历史中，有许多可敬可爱的英雄人物和动人的事迹，其中有许多是儿童所能了解而富有教育意义的画材。特别是在轰轰烈烈的解放战争中，例如刘志丹、刘胡兰、黄继光等无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹，和在辉煌灿烂的社会主义建设中，工农业各个方面涌现出的可惊可喜的新气象与新人物，都需要画家们去选择并创作出作品来给儿童们看。在寓言和童话方面，在我们中国也多得很。举最普通的来说，例如鹬蚌相争、愚公移山、守株待兔、中山狼等等，都是儿童所感兴趣的，都是儿童欣赏画的好题材。总之，不论古今中外，凡是内容意义符合于儿童五爱——爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物——的故事，都可以创作出各种形式的美术作品来，供给广大的儿童们欣赏。
    画家们，为儿童多创作些作品吧！
