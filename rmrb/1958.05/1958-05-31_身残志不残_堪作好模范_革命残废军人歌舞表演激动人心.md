Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The Sichuan Province Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen's Recuperation Center Performance Troupe, currently visiting Beijing, gave a special performance for Beijing's literary and art circles today. The performances by actors who were disabled in their limbs or blind were full of revolutionary optimism, greatly inspiring the audience. The congratulatory message presented to them on the spot by Beijing's literary and art circles read: "You dedicate yourselves wholeheartedly, disabled but not stopping; you are the good sons and daughters of the motherland, the good fighters of the Party. If the disabled are like this, how can those with arms, legs, and eyes dare to be less than you?"

The disabled "actors" performed a total of nineteen folk songs and dances, as well as instrumental solos and ensembles. Gou Zhongyu, a first-class disabled revolutionary soldier who had both hands amputated, performed "Harmonica Ensemble." Zhang Jiachen, a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier who also had both hands amputated, played "I Love My Motherland" on the reed organ. He Changjun, a first-class revolutionary disabled soldier with lower limb paralysis, sang beautiful Sichuan folk songs, accompanied by Yang Chaoan, a first-class disabled soldier who was blind. Many people were moved to tears during their performances. At the end of the performance, the entire audience stood up, and the enthusiastic applause lasted for a long time.

Before the performance began, Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, gave a speech, saying, "You are disabled but not demoralized, and your revolutionary optimism can truly serve as a model for us." At the end of the performance, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Tian Han, Chairman of the China Dramatists Association, and Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, went on stage to shake hands with the actors. Xia Yan presented the performance troupe with a certificate of merit from the Ministry of Culture. The certificate read: "You have made meritorious contributions to the Party and the people on the battlefield, and you have also demonstrated the spirit of heroic struggle of revolutionary soldiers in socialist construction, striving to carry out literary and artistic activities, making outstanding achievements in educating the people to cooperate with socialist production and construction, and setting a brilliant example for carrying out mass literary and artistic activities."

The performance troupe consists of thirty-eight people. They recently came to Beijing to give a report performance for the National Civil Affairs Work Conference. Most of the team members are heroic soldiers who were wounded in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. More than ten of them were originally illiterate, but now most have reached the cultural level of senior primary school and junior high school, and can write their own lyrics and compose music. Some of the programs they played today were their own creations.

    身残志不残　堪作好模范
    革命残废军人歌舞表演激动人心
    新华社30日讯　正在北京访问的四川省革命残废军人教养院课业演出队今天为北京文艺界举行了一场招待演出。手足残废、双眼失明的演员们充满着革命乐观主义的表演使全场观众受到极大的鼓舞。北京文艺界当场向他们赠送的贺词上写道：“你们鞠躬尽瘁残而不已，你们是祖国的好儿女，党的好战士，残废者尚且如此，有胳膊、腿有眼睛的好意思不如你？”
    这些残废的“演员”们今天共表演了十九个民间歌舞和器乐独奏合奏等节目。截断了双手的一等残废革命军人苟中玉等演出了“口琴合奏”，截断了双手的一等革命残废军人张家琛用风琴演奏了“我爱我的祖国”，下肢瘫痪的一等革命残废军人何长俊演唱了优美的四川民歌，担任伴奏的是双目失明的一等残废军人杨朝安等。他们演出时许多人激动得流了眼泪，演出结束的时候，全场起立，热烈的掌声久久不息。
    在演出开始以前，内务部副部长陈其瑗讲了话，他说，你们身残志不残，你们的革命乐观主义的思想，真可以做为我们的模范。在演出结束时，文化部副部长夏衍，中国文联秘书长阳翰笙，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉，中国音乐家协会主席吕骥等上台同演员们握手，夏衍把文化部的一面奖状赠给演出队。这面奖状上写道：“你们在战场上为党和人民立了功，在社会主义建设中也发挥了革命战士英勇奋斗的精神，努力开展文艺活动，为教育人民配合社会主义生产建设做出了优异的成绩，为开展群众性文艺活动树立了光辉榜样”。
    这个演出队共有三十八人，他们是为了向全国民政工作会议汇报演出而在最近来到北京的。全队之中大部分人都是在抗美援朝战争中负伤的英雄战士，他们之中原先有十多个人是文盲，但是现在大部分已经有了高小和初中的文化水平，并且能自己做词作曲，他们今天演奏的节目中有一部分就是自己创作的。
