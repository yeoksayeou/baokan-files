Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 22nd: Anti-fascist organizations to defend the republican system are being established throughout France.

As of May 22nd, provincial vigilance committees had been formed in twenty-one provinces, including Ardèche, Basses-Alpes, and Bas-Rhin. These committees are jointly composed of all parties and groups that uphold the republican system, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" General Confederation of Labor, the National Education Federation, the National Teachers' Union, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and the Secular League of Education.

At the same time, new local anti-fascist committees are being established every day. It has been announced that eighty-seven such committees have been established in the Seine province. Anti-fascist committees have also been established in enterprises in some cities, including the Saint-Brieuc railway workers and the Bordeaux-Mérignac airport staff. Students in Clermont-Ferrand have also organized a liaison committee to defend the republican system.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 21st: The French Anti-Fascist Resistance Committee has issued an appeal to French Prime Minister Pflimlin, urging the Pflimlin government to "defend the Republic" and "not be intimidated by the Algerian rebel army."

The appeal pointed out that the government should implement the state of emergency law to deal with all rebels who are engaged in anti-republican conspiracies on French soil. To this end, the government should allow "the people to have the right to act freely to defend freedom and oppose fascism."

The committee finally called on all democratic organizations and all freedom-loving French people to be vigilant and make various useful contacts to support the government's anti-fascist resistance and to counter all attempts to stifle freedom, so that a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue would be possible.

Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report on the 21st, the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, expressing solidarity with the French working people's anti-fascist struggle. The telegram said that in this historic struggle, the French working class has once again proved that it is the most resolute force in France in defending democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 21st: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor, saying that the workers of the world are watching with great sympathy the struggle of the French working class and all French democrats against the conspiracies of fascism and colonialism, and warmly salute them.

The World Federation of Trade Unions assured the French General Confederation of Labor that it would provide full support.

The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions also sent similar telegrams to the French Workers' Force General Confederation of Labor and the French Confederation of Christian Workers. (Attached picture)
