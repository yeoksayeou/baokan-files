Everything is for the Sick Child
——Remembering the Beijing Children's Hospital
    Yao Di
    Going west from Fuxingmen, along the moat to the north, you can see a series of very beautiful gray buildings, which is the Beijing Children's Hospital.
    Beijing Children's Hospital has internal medicine, surgery, ENT, and traditional Chinese medicine departments, with more than one hundred doctors and six hundred beds. The ward equipment is designed according to the psychological and physiological characteristics of children. The walls are hung with brightly colored pictures of bears taking baths, elephants acting as doctors, and rabbits eating. Each ward faces south with plenty of sunshine. In the wards for older children, there are comic books and simple books. In a delicate playroom, there are also various toys such as rocking horses, small pedal cars, playing cards, chess pieces, and clay figures, making it feel like a nursery.
    Since its establishment in 1955, this hospital has treated various diseases for 150,000 children. There was a premature twin, weighing only 1,150 grams upon admission, who also suffered from pneumonia. After the medical staff's patient treatment and care, the child's weight increased to 2,800 grams when discharged. A Korean child had four large bedsores on his body. The medical staff took great care of him, and specially made nutritious food that he loved to increase his appetite. Many medical staff members showed meticulous care and concern when treating and caring for sick children. Nurse Liu Yufen saw that the patients in the night clinic were too cold, so she put her own quilt on the sick child. Once, a sick child was having difficulty breathing, so she sucked the phlegm out of the child's mouth with her own mouth. Nursing staff member Yu Jushan fed her own milk to the sick child in order to help him recover as soon as possible.
    Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the medical staff has been further improved through rectification, and a series of reforms have also been carried out in the diagnosis and treatment system.
    What the parents of patients are most satisfied with is that now they can take their children to the Children's Hospital for treatment at any time, day or night, within 24 hours a day. In the past, there were always many people registering during the morning clinic hours, often waiting for half a day. Now, parents can choose different times to bring their children to see a doctor according to their own situation, and the hospital is no longer crowded, and they can see a doctor as soon as they arrive.
    In order to ensure the nutrition of sick children, the Children's Hospital originally stipulated that breastfeeding mothers could stay in the hospital, but because the mothers had to leave after feeding, the mothers could not actually take care of their children themselves. As for children who do not breastfeed, parents are generally not allowed to stay with them. After rectification, this system has also been changed. Now the hospital stipulates that parents can stay with children under the age of three, and can stay with the sick child all the time except for rest. In this way, the children recover faster because their parents take care of them personally. In order to make it more convenient for parents to stay in the hospital, the hospital also built a cafeteria specially for parents, and reduced the original accommodation fee from 45 cents to 20 cents.
    In the past, when a sick child was hospitalized, from the initial diagnosis, hospitalization, to recovery and discharge, it often had to go through the hands of several doctors, and each doctor always had to look through the medical records when he first saw it, which was a waste of time and manpower. Now, the hospital stipulates a consistent doctor responsibility system, that is, a sick child is responsible by one doctor from admission to discharge. This strengthens the doctor's sense of responsibility and overcomes the phenomenon of mutual shirking of responsibility in the past when problems arise, which has had a good effect on the treatment of sick children.
    Recently, the vast majority of staff at the Children's Hospital have further improved their ideological awareness through heart-to-heart movements, established the proletarian medical thought, and will better serve the second generation of the motherland.

    一切为病儿着想
    ——记北京市儿童医院
    姚堤
    西出复兴门，沿护城河往北，可以看到一幢幢相连的十分美丽的灰色大楼，这里就是北京市儿童医院。
    北京市儿童医院分内科、外科、五官科、中医，有一百多位大夫，六百张病床。病房设备都是根据儿童的心理和生理的特点设置的，墙壁上挂有小熊洗澡，小象当大夫，小兔子吃饭等色彩鲜艳的图片。每间病房都朝南，阳光充足。大孩子的病房里有连环画和浅近的书籍。在一间精致的游戏室里，还有木马、小脚踏车、扑克、棋子、泥人等各种玩具，走进去就好像到了托儿所。
    这所医院从1955年成立以来，已经为十五万儿童治疗了各种疾病。有一个双胎早产儿，入院时体重只有一千一百五十克，又患肺炎，病情危急，经过医务人员耐心地治疗和护理，病儿出院时体重增加到二千八百克。有个朝鲜小孩，身上患了四处大褥疮，医务人员非常细心地护理他，为了增加他的食欲，还专门给他做出他又爱吃又有营养的食物。不少医务人员在治疗和护理病儿时，表现了无微不至的体贴和关怀。护士刘玉芬看到夜间门诊病人太冷，就把自己的被子盖在病孩身上。一次，有个病儿喘蹩得很难受，她就用嘴把病孩的痰吸出来。护理人员俞掬珊，为了使病孩早日痊愈，把自己的奶喂给病孩吃。
    在全国大跃进的形势下，经过整风，医务人员的积极性进一步提高了，诊疗制度也有了一系列的改革。
    首先使病人家长们感到满意的是，现在他们带孩子到儿童医院看病，不管是在白天还是黑夜，在一天二十四小时内，可以随到随看。过去每天上午门诊时间，挂号的人总是很多，往往一等就是半天。现在，家长们可以根据自己的情况选择不同的时间带孩子看病，医院里不拥挤了，来了就看病。
    为了保证病儿的营养，儿童医院原规定喂奶的母亲可以陪住医院，但是由于母亲喂完奶就要走开，因此妈妈们实际上不能亲自照料孩子。至于不吃奶的孩子，一般是不让家长陪住的。经过整风，这一制度也改变了。现在医院规定三周岁以下的幼儿住院，家长都可以陪住，而且除休息外，可以一直陪侍在病儿身旁。这样一来，由于家长亲自照料，孩子痊愈得更快了。为了使家长住院更方便，院里还专门为家长们盖了一所食堂，并且把原来的陪住费由四角五分减到二角。
    过去，一个病儿住院，从初诊、住院，一直到病愈出院，往往要经过好几个大夫的手，而每一个大夫初看时总要翻一下病历，无论在时间上、人力上都有些浪费。现在，医院规定了大夫一贯负责制，即一个病儿从入院到出院，一直由一位大夫负责。这样加强了大夫的责任心，克服了过去遇有问题时互相推卸责任的现象，对病儿的治疗发生了良好的效果。
    最近，儿童医院的绝大多数工作人员经过交心运动，更进一步提高了思想觉悟，树立无产阶级的医疗思想，将更好地为祖国第二代服务。
