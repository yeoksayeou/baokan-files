Transforming Low-Yielding Fields into High-Yielding Fields, and High-Yielding Fields into Even Higher-Yielding Fields
Guangdong Province Launches Mass Soil Identification Campaign

(Our newspaper Guangzhou dispatch, May 25th) A province-wide mass soil identification campaign is gradually unfolding in Guangdong Province, and is expected to be fully completed within the year. This measure will promote the transformation of all low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields within the province, and enable high-yielding fields to achieve even higher yields.

The current problems that need to be solved are: How to rationally utilize land and fully exploit soil potential? What standards should be used to improve the soil? What types of soil are suitable for planting which varieties of crops? The overall question is: How to transform all low-yielding fields in the province into high-yielding fields, and high-yielding fields into even higher-yielding fields. Therefore, by identifying the soil, understanding the nature, characteristics, and nutrient content of various soils, a reliable scientific basis will be provided for solving the above problems.

Before the end of April, Guangdong Province had already completed pilot soil work in 149 agricultural cooperatives, covering a total land area of 1 million mu. The experience gained shows that: Largely training peasant technicians and transferring technology to the masses can guarantee the completion of this major task quickly, efficiently, and economically. Nearly 400 peasant technicians trained in the pilot work are not only able to excellently undertake technical projects such as field surveys, soil classification, and mapping, but also able to master practical scientific basic knowledge such as soil improvement, scientific farming, and rational land use. Currently, technical training classes are being held everywhere. In the future, the general survey will be led by the masses, with scientific and technical cadres acting as advisors.

The soil identification campaign launched in Guangdong Province starts with summarizing production, closely integrates with current production, takes both short-term and long-term considerations into account, and adopts the measures of "identifying, acting, and reforming simultaneously." Therefore, it has aroused the widespread attention of agricultural cooperatives and is very popular among the masses.

### 让低产田变高产　高产田更高产  广东省开展群众性的土壤鉴定工作

    让低产田变高产　高产田更高产
    广东省开展群众性的土壤鉴定工作
    本报广州25日电　广东省全省规模的群众性的土壤鉴定工作，正在全省逐步展开，将在年内全面完成。这项措施将促使省内全部低产田变高产，高产田达到更高产。
    当前需要解决的问题是：如何合理利用土地、充分发挥土壤潜力？根据什么标准进行改良土壤？什么土壤适宜种植什么品种作物？总的问题是，如何使省内全部低产田变高产，高产田达到更高产。因此，通过土壤鉴定，摸清各种土壤的本质、特性和所含养分，对解决上述问题将提供可靠的科学根据。
    广东省在4月底以前，已完成了一百四十九个农业社、土地总面积一百万亩的土壤试点工作，获得的经验表明：大量培养农民技术员、把技术交给群众，就能够保证多快好省地完成这项重大的任务。在试点工作中培养起来的近四百名农民技术员，他们不仅能够出色地担负起田土普查、土壤分类和绘图等技术项目，而且也能够掌握改良土壤、科学耕作、合理利用土地等实际科学基础知识。现在，各地正纷纷举办技术训练班。将来普查工作即由群众当主将，科学技术干部当参谋。
    广东省展开的土壤鉴定是从总结生产入手，与当前生产紧密结合，近远兼顾，采取“边鉴定、边行动、边改革”的措施，因此引起了农业社的普遍重视，很受群众欢迎。
