Comrade Kang Bocheng, First Secretary of the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province.

　　The ancient battlefield, Jinsha Beach, is located in the triangular area of Daren, Yingxian, and Shanyin in northern Shanxi. It covers a total area of 210 square kilometers and has more than 85,000 mu of arable land, including 35 villages, 33 cooperatives, and a population of 21,349. According to historical records and existing ancient buildings, the original appearance of Jinsha Beach was: the majestic Hongtao Mountain in the northwest, with dense forests; and Huanghua Liang in the southeast, with towering old cypresses. The mountains and ridges face each other, forming two natural green barriers, protecting the forty-li Jinsha Beach and the plains on both sides of the Sanggan River. In the fourth year of Dade in the Yuan Dynasty, tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians were organized to cultivate here, proving that it was a fertile field at that time. However, due to the devastation of the Song-Jin War and subsequent wars, this fertile land was repeatedly destroyed, and the forests were felled, turning Jinsha Beach into a boundless beach and sand dune. Because the forests were cut down, it caused a dry climate with strong winds and sand. People say that the climate here is: "Wear fur coats in the morning and gauze at noon, hug the stove and eat watermelon." The wind and sand are described as: "People walk on the roof, dung circles don't transport soil, no wind in early summer, wind buries people," "A wind all year round, two or three years of crop failure." Indeed, this severe wind and sand erosion directly affects the development of agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives. Starting from this fundamental situation, mobilizing the masses, greening Jinsha Beach, and fighting against wind and sand has become an important measure for developing agricultural production locally.

　　In view of the above situation, in 1953, we began to conduct overall planning in Jinsha Beach, delineating state-owned forest areas and creating windbreak forest networks, starting with experiments. However, in the beginning, due to lack of experience and failure to grasp the characteristics and laws of the wind and sand areas, the same afforestation methods as in general areas were adopted. The survival rate of tree planting was only 40% to 60%, and the growth was not good. The hundreds of mu of apricot trees sown in Huanghua Liang failed due to drought, lack of seedlings, and the accumulation of wind and sand. There were many discussions among the people, who said, "The weather outside Yanmen Pass is dry, and a small tree as thick as a bowl takes decades." Saying "Planting trees but not seeing trees, afforestation but not seeing forests," "Looking at the sea on a dry mountain, distant water cannot quench near thirst," and so on. However, we did not abandon this fundamental measure of transforming nature because of failure, nor were we shaken by those right-leaning pessimistic arguments. After research and summing up lessons, we continued to persevere and finally achieved success. The facts gave a powerful answer to people's doubts, "It's not that the weather outside Yanmen Pass is dry, and a small tree as thick as a bowl takes decades," but rather: "Ten years can make an oak, fifteen years can make a purlin." It's not "Planting trees but not seeing trees, afforestation but not seeing forests," but rather: "Rows of green belts, patches of forests." This banner of successful state-owned afforestation experiments not only educated the leadership and enhanced confidence and determination, but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, tree planting, and wind and sand prevention.

　　After two years of experimentation and three years of intensive efforts, by the spring of 1958, the entire beach had been basically greened. The desolate appearance of strong winds and sand in the past has been initially changed. A total of more than 118,000 mu of forest have been planted (including 66,000 mu of state-owned afforestation and more than 52,000 mu of mass cooperative afforestation), and there are 1,110 mu of economic forests such as fruit trees. This accounts for 33.7% of the total area, with an average of 22 mu of young forest per household. In Tianzhuang Village, 152 households have an average of 30 mu of young forest. In the autumn of 1953, windbreak forest networks were created on the 30,000 mu of severely windy and sandy areas on Jinsha Beach. A total of 77 main and secondary forest belts were built, with a length of 109 kilometers, a width of 17 meters, and 11 rows of trees, forming a grid of 77 squares, each protecting 337 mu of farmland, totaling 26,000 mu. A green net was woven in the sand, forming rows of forest belts in both directions. In 1956, the masses in Liu Yanzhuang and Shang Xizhuang began to use the land in the grid to sow seeds. Due to the windbreak effect of afforestation in Huzhai Village, the population and arable land have been stabilized. In 1952, only eight households remained in the village, and now 32 households have settled down. The historically grain-deficient society was already self-sufficient in 1957. Three windbreak forest belts were built in Huanghua Liang, with a total length of 90 li and an area of 45,000 mu, turning the bare ridge into rows of green belts and dense young forests, and beginning to play the role of "preventing wind and fixing sand, accumulating snow and settling mud." Therefore, the masses happily said, "The ridges are full of pasture, and there are trees to block the wind." The unit yield per mu of the Hujialing and Caozhuang cooperatives has increased by more than 30% compared with the past. At present, the young forests are growing well, with straight trunks and lush branches and leaves, reaching a height of one to three meters. In a few years, the people living on Jinsha Beach will be able to own a great fortune with just trees alone.

　　The measures we have taken to green Jinsha Beach in the past five years are:

　　First, overall planning, prevention according to harm, combining state-owned afforestation with mass afforestation.

　　The primary task of transforming Jinsha Beach is afforestation and greening to prevent the harm of wind and sand as quickly as possible. However, the area here is vast, the population is sparse, and labor is lacking. In order to solve this problem, when we planned in the beginning, we followed the principle of combining state-owned afforestation with mass afforestation, and determined two forms of afforestation. Huanghua Liang has an area of 80,000 mu, which is suitable for developing coniferous forests, which the masses cannot achieve. Therefore, it is planned as a state-owned forest base. First, plant fast-growing trees so that they can play a role in preventing wind and sand as soon as possible, and then gradually change to coniferous forests. Jinsha Beach is suitable for developing fast-growing trees. Some economic forests can also be appropriately developed in the forest network and around villages, which can quickly prevent wind and sand and can also be used for timber in the near future, which the masses can also do. Therefore, in addition to the 30,000 mu of severely windy and sandy areas being the responsibility of the State-owned Afforestation Bureau to build windbreak forest networks, the rest is completely designated as mass afforestation areas. On this basis, according to the principle of overall planning and prevention according to harm, we took the entire area of 210 square kilometers as a whole and carried out regional forestry design. The setting of forest networks and forest belts, the matching of tree species, the configuration of protective forests, timber forests, and economic forests, and the order of cultivation of various forests were all uniformly arranged. As a result of the planning, a total of 150,000 mu of forest need to be planted in the entire area, of which 15,000 mu can be developed into economic forests such as apples, betel nuts, and grapes. In the past five years, 80% of the original planned tasks have been completed. The forests that have been planted are now connected into points, belts, and nets.

　　Second, relying on the masses, supporting each other, and organizing joint societies, joint townships, and joint county cooperation.

　　The work of greening Jinsha Beach began in 1953, first with state-owned large-scale experiments. Mass afforestation was still mostly small-scale cultivation. After the cooperativization, a new type of collectivized economic system was adopted, with the community as the unit to carry out centralized afforestation under unified planning. This is the main form of greening Jinsha Beach.

　　This spring, after the great rectification movement, criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, and inspired by the overall great leap forward situation, we also seriously summarized the experience of organizing 200,000 people in the entire region in 1956 to green the Sanggan River for half a month, and proposed the slogan of greening Jinsha Beach in one year. Mobilizing 15,000 people from the three counties of Daren, Yingxian, and Shanyin to march towards the sand. After eight days and nights of hard work, the entire beach was basically greened, with a total of more than 54,000 mu of forest planted. Eight days of time is almost equal to the sum of afforestation tasks in the past five years.

　　The facts of greening Jinsha Beach show that the entire afforestation work must be carried out according to the new method of concentrated construction by mountain range and river system. Especially in deep mountains and barren slopes with vast areas, sparse population, and lack of labor, in addition to planning a part of the state-owned forest afforestation base in a planned way, as long as we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and are good at organizing the masses, supporting each other, and cooperating with each other, we will greatly accelerate the greening speed of these places.

　　Third, learn from experience, summarize mass experience, and strengthen technical guidance.

　　There were lessons in technical guidance. The main reason for the low survival rate of tree planting in the spring of 1953 was the lack of specific technical measures adapted to local conditions. We accepted this lesson and summarized the successful afforestation experience of some local people. The following five measures were taken technically:

　　1. The drought-resistant, wind-resistant, and fast-growing Populus simonii was selected as the main tree species for the first step of greening, and strong seedlings with strong germination ability were carefully selected before planting trees.

　　2. According to the arid characteristics of sand beaches and sand dunes, land was turned and prepared one season or one year before afforestation, so that the soil could retain moisture to facilitate tree survival.

　　3. The method of layering was promoted, that is, the three essentials of deep burial, shallow exposure, and solid stepping for afforestation were implemented. According to the masses, it is called: "The pit is two and a half feet deep, the cooked soil is padded at the bottom of the pit, the burial is deep and the exposed head is short, and the backfill is stepped three times."

　　4. Close planting is implemented to enhance wind resistance.

　　5. In the cultivation of young forests, the method of planting trees in the same year and deep plowing and loosening the soil in the second year is implemented, and then the young forests are flattened, which not only promotes the growth of young forests, but also solves the difficulty of insufficient seedlings. People call it a "natural nursery."

　　As a result of the implementation of the above five measures, the survival rate of tree planting reached more than 95%. And before each season of sowing, technical training classes are held with the construction site as the school and the project as the teaching material, training more than 2,000 mass technicians successively. Now everyone understands and can do afforestation technology.

　　The greening project completed in Jinsha Beach is only the first step. In order to completely change the desolate appearance, basic water conservancy has been realized on the 65,000 mu of basic farmland this spring. According to the original plan, the second step is to build 15,000 mu of economic forests within the scope of the 36 villages. Pasture is sown on the open space of the forest network to improve the soil and develop animal husbandry. We can predict that in a few years, the wind and sand of the forty-li Jinsha Beach will be completely defeated, and this barren land will surely be built into a rich, beautiful, and happy paradise.

　　绿化金沙滩
　　中共山西省雁北地委第一书记　康伯成
    古战场——金沙滩，位于雁北大仁、应县、山阴三角地带。总面积为二百一十平方公里。现有耕地八万五千余亩。其中包括有三十五个村庄，三十三个合作社，二万一千三百四十九口人。根据历史记载和现存的一些古建筑证明，金沙滩原来的面貌是：西北有巍峨雄壮的洪涛山，森林密布；东南有黄花梁，苍柏参天。山梁相对，形成两座天然的绿色屏障，保护着四十里的金沙滩和桑干河两岸的平原。元朝大德四年，曾组织军民万人，在这里屯垦，证明那时候这里是一片肥沃的田野。但由于宋、金大战和后来历代战争的摧残，使这一块肥美的地方一次又一次遭到破坏，森林被洗伐。使金沙滩变成一望无际的沙滩沙丘了。由于森林被砍伐，便造成气候干旱，风大沙多的荒凉面貌。人们说这里的气候是：“早穿皮袄午穿纱，抱住火炉吃西瓜”。形容这里的风沙是：“人在房上走，垫圈不运土，立夏不起风，起风埋住人”，“一年四季一场风，三年两头没收成”。的确这种风沙侵袭的严重情况，直接地影响着农业生产的发展和人民群众的生活改善。从这一根本情况出发，发动群众，绿化金沙滩，向风沙斗争，就成为当地发展农业生产的一项重要措施。
    鉴于上述这种情况，于1953年我们即在金沙滩着手进行全面规划，划定国营林区，营造防风林网，首先进行试验。但是开始由于缺乏经验，没有掌握了风沙区的特点和规律，采取了与一般地区相同的造林方法，植树的成活率只达40％至60％，而且生长不好。黄花梁播种的数百亩杏树，因干旱没有出苗和风沙的积压而失败了。人们的议论很多，他们说：“雁门关外天气干，碗口粗的小树也得几十年”。说什么“种树不见树，造林不见林”，“干山头上望大海，远水不解近渴”等等。但我们并没有因失败而放弃这一改造自然的根本措施。也没有被那些右倾悲观的论调而动摇决心。经过研究，总结教训，还是继续地坚持了下来，终于获得了成功。事实对于人们的怀疑作了有力的回答，“不是雁门关天气干，碗口粗的小树还得几十年”，而是：“十年可以成橡，十五年可以成檩”。不是“种树不见树，造林不见林”，而是：“条条绿带，片片成林”。国营造林试验成功的这一面旗帜，既教育了领导，增强了信心和决心，也大大的激发了群众造林植树防御风沙的积极性。
    经过两年试验，三年突击，到1958年春季，全滩已经基本绿化。过去风大沙多的荒凉面貌，初步得到改观。总计造林十一万八千余亩（其中国营造林六万六千亩，群众合作造林五万二千余亩），并有果树等经济林一千一百一十亩。占到总面积的33.7％，每户平均现在幼林二十二亩，田庄村一百五十二户每户平均已达三十亩幼林。1953年秋季，在金沙滩上三万亩严重风沙区的面积上营造护田林网。计造主副林带七十七条，长一百零九公里，带宽十七公尺，造林十一行，构成方格网眼七十七个，每网护田三百三十七亩，共计护地二万六千亩，在沙滩中编织成一张绿网，形成横竖成行的林带。1956年刘晏庄、尚希庄群众开始利用网眼土地进行播种。胡寨村由于造林防风的作用，人口和耕地已经固定。1952年全村仅留八户，现在三十二户群众都定居下来。历史上的缺粮社，1957年已经自给。黄花梁营造三条防风林带，全长九十华里，面积四万五千亩，使光秃秃的梁头，变为条条绿带和茂密的幼林，开始起到了“防风固沙，积雪沉泥”的作用。所以群众高兴的说：“牧草长满梁，刮风有树挡”。胡家岭、曹庄合作社，单位亩产量比过去提高30％多。目前幼林生长良好，干形通直，枝叶茂盛，高达一到三公尺。再待几年，住在金沙滩上的人们，只树一项就可以拥有万贯家产了。
    五年来绿化金沙摊，我们所采取的措施是：
    第一，全面规划，因害设防，国营造林与群众造林相结合。
    改造金沙滩的首要任务是造林绿化，以最快的速度防治风沙的危害。但是这里地区辽阔，人口稀少，劳力缺乏。为了解决这个问题，当初我们规划的时候，就本着国营造林和群众造林相结合的原则，确定为两种造林形式。黄花梁面积八万亩，适宜于发展针叶林，群众力量达不到。因此就规划为国营林基地。先造速成树，使其早日起到防治风沙的作用，然后逐步更易为针叶林。金沙滩适宜于发展快速树，在林网内和村庄周围还可以适当的发展一些经济林，既能很快的防治风沙，又能近期得利用材，群众也办得到。所以除了三万亩严重的风沙区由国营造林局负责营造防风林网外，其余完全划为群众造林区。在此基础上，根据全面规划，因害设防的原则，我们将全滩二百一十平方公里的面积作为一个整体，进行了区域性的营林设计。对林网、林带的设置，树种的搭配，防护林、用材林和经济林的配置，各种林的先后培植次序，都作了统一安排。规划的结果，整个面积内需要造林十五万亩，其中可发展苹果、槟果、葡萄等经济林一点五万亩，五年来已经完成原定规划任务的80％。目前所造之林，已经是连点成带，连带成网。
    第二，依靠群众，相互支援，组织联社、联乡、联县协作。
    绿化金沙滩的工作，从1953年开始，先由国营大面试验。群众造林，还多是小片栽培。合作化以后，与集体经济制度相适应的一种新的即以社为单位在统一规划下，实行集中成片造林。这是绿化金沙滩的主要形式。
    今年春天经过伟大的整风运动，批判了右倾保守思想，并在全面大跃进形势的鼓舞下，我们又认真的总结了1956年全区组织二十万人半月绿化桑干河的协作经验，提出一年绿化金沙滩的口号。动员大仁、应县、山阴三个县一万五千人向沙滩进军。苦战八昼夜，基本绿化全滩，共造林五万四千余亩。八天的时间，几乎等于过去五年造林任务的总和。
    绿化金沙滩的事实表明，整个造林工作，必须是按山脉、按河系，集中营造的新的方法。尤其是在地区辽阔，人口稀少，劳力缺乏的深山、荒坡，除了有计划的规划一部分国有林的造林基地外，只要相信群众，依靠群众，发扬广大群众的革命干劲，善于组织群众，互相支援，互相协作，必将大大的加快这些地方的绿化速度。
    第三，接受教训，总结群众经验，加强技术指导。
    在技术指导上不是没有教训的。1953年春季植树成活率不高的主要原因是没有因地制宜的具体的技术措施。我们接受了这个教训，并总结了当地群众中一些造林成功的经验。在技术上采取了以下五条措施：
    1、选定了以当地耐旱、抗风力强、生长快的小叶杨，作为第一步绿化的主要树种，并在植树前精选青壮发芽能力强的秧苗。
      2、根据沙滩、沙丘的干旱的特点，在造林前一季或一年，进行翻地整地，使土壤保蓄水分，以利树木成活。
    3、推广压条的办法，即实行深埋、浅露、踏实的造林三要诀。按照群众说法叫做：“坑深二尺半，熟土坑底垫，埋深露头短，复土踏三遍”。
    4、实行密植，增强抗风能力。
    5、在幼林抚育上，实行当年植树，第二年深耕松土的方法，然后将幼林平茬，既促进了幼林的成长，又解决了树苗不足的困难。人们称之为“天然苗圃”。
    推行上述五项措施的结果，植树成活率达到95％以上。并且每季播种以前，即以工地为学校，以工程为教材，开办技术训练班，先后共训练群众技术员二千余人。如今在造林技术上已经是人人皆懂，个个都会了。
    金沙滩所完成的绿化工程，还是第一步，为彻底改变荒凉面貌，今春在六万五千亩的基本农田面积上，已经实现基本水利化。按照原定的规划，第二步在三十六个村庄范围之内，营造经济林一点五万亩。在林网的方格网眼空地上播种牧草，以改良土壤，发展畜牧业。我们可以预言，再过几年，四十里的金沙滩的风沙，必将被彻底战胜，这块荒凉不毛之地，一定会建设成为富饶美丽幸福的乐园。
