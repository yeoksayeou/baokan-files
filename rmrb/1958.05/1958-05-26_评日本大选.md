    A Critique of the Japanese General Election

    On May 22nd, Japan held its seventh post-war general election for the House of Representatives. The results of this election show that left-wing parties secured more than one-third of the seats in the 467-member House of Representatives. The votes obtained by left-wing parties accounted for 35.6% of the total votes, an increase of 3.4% compared to the previous general election. Among them, the Socialist Party held 166 seats, an increase of eight seats; although the Japanese Communist Party suffered continuous persecution by the Japanese reactionaries and its seats decreased from two to one, the votes it obtained increased from over 730,000 in the previous general election to 1.1 million in this election, an increase of over 300,000 votes, a sharp increase of nearly 50% compared to the previous general election. On the other hand, the Liberal Democratic Party, which represents the interests of Japanese monopoly capital, lost three seats and retained 287 seats; the proportion of votes it obtained in the total votes decreased by 5.4% compared to the previous election. In addition, small parties occupied one seat, and independent candidates occupied twelve seats.

    In this election, the goal of the Kishi Nobusuke group was to attempt to obtain two-thirds of the seats in order to create conditions for amending the current Japanese Constitution, so as to reorganize armaments on a relatively large scale in the future and deprive the Japanese working people of their meager democratic rights. The American reactionaries fully supported the Kishi Nobusuke group, so they launched their kept media to cheer them on. Kishi Nobusuke himself also boasted to the whole country before the election that the Liberal Democratic Party "must get" 310 seats in this election. In other words, they attempted to use the goal of winning more than two-thirds of the seats to maximize the mobilization of supporters of monopoly capital and reactionary policies. However, as a result of the election, the Liberal Democratic Party not only failed to obtain 310 seats, but also failed to maintain the number of seats it had before the election. This has once again seriously frustrated the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to amend the Constitution, which they had painstakingly prepared for several years. This is a gradual rise of Japanese democratic forces advocating that Japan get rid of American control and take the path of peace, independence, and democracy, and another major victory for the Japanese people against the reactionary forces headed by Kishi Nobusuke. Even the United States had to admit this victory. A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on the 23rd stated: "This has indeed shattered Kishi Nobusuke's plan to amend the Constitution so as to more easily establish Japan's self-defense forces and give the Emperor more power."

    Secondly, before this election, the American and Japanese reactionaries had been hoping to strengthen the power of the Kishi Nobusuke group within the parliament and the Liberal Democratic Party through this election, in order to establish the so-called "Kishi regime," a relatively stable reactionary regime, centered on the Kishi Nobusuke group, which would externally carry out expansion and internally intensify the exploitation of the people. However, the results of the election dashed the hopes of the American and Japanese reactionaries as well. As a result of Kishi Nobusuke and his group implementing a policy of relying on the United States, being hostile to our country, and reviving Japanese militarism, through this election, the Kishi Nobusuke group's position within the Liberal Democratic Party was not further strengthened, but weakened. This election proves that the factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party will become increasingly acute and complex, and therefore Japan's future political situation will also become more unstable. In this election, the seats occupied by the Kishi Nobusuke faction within the Liberal Democratic Party have decreased from more than 70 in the past to more than 60, a decrease of about 10 seats. Many capable reactionary elements of the Kishi Nobusuke faction, such as the head of the Japanese fascist police, the current Minister of Justice in the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, Toshiki Karasawa, the former Minister of Home Affairs in the first Yoshida Cabinet and current Supreme Advisor to the Liberal Democratic Party, Etsujiro Uehara, the former Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the war, who was once detained as a Class A war criminal after the war, and Yoshio Suma, who sang in tune with the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, and the former Minister of Transportation in the first Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, Taneo Miyazawa, and others, were all defeated, which also reflects the Japanese people's aversion to die-hard reactionaries, and at the same time, it also shows the weakening of the Kishi Nobusuke faction's power. It can be affirmed that the struggle for power and profit among the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party will become increasingly strange and developed. The Tokyo broadcast on the 23rd of this month expressed concern about the increasing instability of Japan's future political situation, which also expressed the unusually anxious voice of Japanese bourgeois "public opinion."

    The struggle in this election was quite acute. Kishi Nobusuke's prestige among the Japanese people is not high. Japanese bourgeois newspapers pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's prestige is far inferior to that of Tanzan Ishibashi and Ichiro Hatoyama. With the deepening of the Japanese economic crisis, Kishi Nobusuke's prestige has declined even further. Kishi Nobusuke's American masters once expressed serious concern about this. Therefore, from the very beginning, the Kishi Nobusuke group used the police and procuratorial organs in the hands of the Japanese government and the huge campaign funds provided by his backer, the monopoly capital group, to concentrate its forces to attack the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party through various despicable means. The trade unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan suffered very blatant oppression. The Japanese government and police even carried out a series of shameful slanders and frame-ups against the Japanese Communist Party. However, workers, students, youth, and women in the cities cast their votes against Kishi Nobusuke, either for the Japanese Socialist Party or for the Japanese Communist Party. The populations of major and medium-sized industrial cities were mobilized, and it can be said that the Japanese working class expressed its common desire with actual unified action, preventing Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy to amend the Constitution and rapidly revive militarism. This is a great victory in any case.

    However, Kishi Nobusuke made full use of their bases in rural villages and mountain villages. Although more than 20% of the rural population abstained in this election, and the abstention rate of farmers in Hokkaido was even higher, Kishi Nobusuke still relied on deceptive influence in the countryside to barely maintain the Liberal Democratic Party's more than 280 seats, which also shows from another aspect that the Japanese working class and the broad masses of peasants still need to engage in arduous work to establish a solid alliance.

    The situation in which the Liberal Democratic Party failed to obtain two-thirds of the seats and the weakening of the Kishi Nobusuke group's power in this general election shows the victory of the Japanese democratic forces and the failure of Kishi Nobusuke and his group's attempt to amend the Constitution. However, the American reactionaries will never relax their control over the Kishi Nobusuke group and the Japanese political situation. Based on the current situation, there are many issues worthy of attention in Japan's domestic and foreign policies with Kishi Nobusuke continuing to be in power.

    In order to strengthen its position within the Liberal Democratic Party to implement the intentions of the United States and Japanese monopoly capital with potential imperialist desires, the Kishi Nobusuke group is actively plotting to unite the reactionary forces in the Liberal Democratic Party. A prominent manifestation of this is to bring Hayato Ikeda, an extreme pro-American element in the Liberal Democratic Party, into the new cabinet. At the same time, after the election, Kishi Nobusuke openly declared that he would establish a so-called "government that cooperates strongly with the United States." On the other hand, under the instigation of the United States, Kishi Nobusuke's collusion with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee has become more frequent day by day. From these signs, it is not difficult to see that Japan has a tendency to be further dragged onto a dangerous road.

    评日本大选
    本月22日，日本举行了战后第七次众议院选举。这次选举的结果，在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，左翼政党取得了超过三分之一的席位。左翼政党所获票数占全部选票的35.6％，比上届大选中所占的比例提高了3.4％。其中社会党占一百六十六席，比过去增加了八席；日本共产党由于连续遭受日本反动派的迫害，议席虽由过去的两席降为一席，但所得选票却由上届大选时的七十三万余票增至本届的一百一十万票，增加了三十余万票，比上届大选时激增了将近50％。另一方面，代表日本垄断资本利益的自由民主党，比过去减少三席，保有二百八十七席；所获票数在总票数中的比例，比上一届减少了5.4％。此外，小党派占一席，无党派人士占十二席。
    在这次选举中，岸信介集团的目标，是企图取得三分之二的议席，为修改日本现行宪法制造条件，以便在今后比较大规模地重整军备和剥夺日本劳动人民仅有的某些民主权利。美国反动派完全支持岸信介集团，因此发动御用舆论，为他们助威。岸信介本人在选举前也向全国吹嘘说，在这次选举中，自由民主党“一定得”三百一十个席位。换言之，就是企图用争取超过三分之二议席作为目标，对垄断资本和反动政策的拥护者们作了最大的动员。可是选举的结果，自由民主党不仅没有取得三百一十个议席，而且连选举前的席数也没有保住。这样就使岸信介集团数年来处心积虑准备修改宪法的阴谋，又一次遭受严重的挫折。这是主张日本摆脱美国控制、走和平、独立、民主的道路的日本民主力量的逐渐上升，日本人民对以岸信介为首的反动势力所取得的又一次重大胜利。这一胜利连美国方面也不得不承认，合众社东京23日电称：“这样一来确实打破了岸信介所希望的修改宪法、以便比较容易地建立日本的自卫队和给予天皇更多的权力”的图谋。
    其次，在这次选举举行以前，美日反动派一直期望通过这次选举，加强岸信介集团在议会内部和自由民主党内部的力量，以便建立以岸信介集团为中心的对外实行扩张、对内加紧压榨人民的所谓“岸体制”，即比较稳定的反动政权。可是选举的结果使美日反动派的希望也同样落空了。由于岸信介及其集团执行投靠美国、敌视我国和复活日本军国主义的政策的结果，通过这次选举，岸信介集团在自由民主党内的地位不仅不是进一步加强，而是被削弱了。这次选举证明，自由民主党内部的派系斗争将日趋尖锐复杂化，因而日本今后的政局也将随之更加不稳。在这次选举中，自由民主党内岸信介派所占的议席，已由过去的七十余席降至六十余席，减少了十席左右。岸信介派的很多得力反动分子，如日本法西斯警察头子、现任岸信介内阁法务大臣唐泽俊树，曾任第一次吉田内阁内务大臣、现任自由民主党最高顾问植原悦二郎，战前曾任日本外务省情报部部长、战后曾一度以甲级战犯罪被拘捕的并和台湾蒋介石集团一鼻孔出气的须磨弥吉郎，曾任第一次岸信介内阁运输大臣的宫泽胤男等人，都落选了，这也反映了日本人民对死硬反动派的厌弃，同时这也说明了岸信介派的力量的削弱。今后可以肯定地说，自由民主党内各派的争权夺利的斗争，将会越出越奇、越来越发展。本月23日的东京广播，对今后日本政局的更加不稳，表示了忧虑，也就说出了日本资产阶级“舆论”的异常焦急的心声。
    这次选举的斗争是相当尖锐的。岸信介在日本人民中声望是不高的。日本资产阶级报纸指出，岸信介的声望实远不如石桥湛山和鸠山一郎。随着日本经济危机的深入，岸信介的声望更加低落。岸信介的美国主子对此曾经表示严重忧虑。因此，岸信介集团从一开始就利用掌握在日本政府手里的警察、检察机构，和他的靠山垄断资本集团所提供的庞大竞选资金，通过各种卑鄙手段，集中力量向日本社会党和共产党进攻。总评系统的各工会遭受非常露骨的压迫。而日本政府和警察更对日本共产党进行了一系列可耻的诬蔑和陷害。但是，城市中的工人、学生、青年和妇女，纷纷投了反对岸信介的票，或则投日本社会党，或则投日本共产党的票。各大中工业城市的人口都动起来了，可以说是日本的工人阶级以实际的统一行动表达了共同的愿望，阻止了岸信介企图修改宪法和急促地复活军国主义的阴谋。这无论如何是一个巨大的胜利。
    但是，岸信介却充分利用了他们在农村、山村中的地盘。尽管农村人口在这次选举中有20％以上的人弃权，并且北海道的农民的弃权率更高，但岸信介还是依靠在农村中的欺骗影响来勉强维持了自由民主党的二百八十多席的席位，这也从另一方面说明了日本工人阶级和广大农民建立巩固的联盟，仍须要从事艰巨的工作。
    这次大选产生的自由民主党未能获得三分之二议席的局面和岸信介集团力量的削弱，说明了日本民主力量的胜利和岸信介及其集团企图修改宪法的失败。但是美国反动派也决不会放松对岸信介集团和对日本政局的控制。根据目前情况来看，今后在岸信介继续执政中，在日本的对内对外政策方面，有不少值得注视的问题。
    岸信介集团为了加强自身在自由民主党内的地位来执行美国和具有潜在帝国主义欲望的日本垄断资本的意旨，正积极地图谋团结自由民主党中的反动力量，其显著表现就是要把自由民主党内的极端亲美分子池田勇人拉入新阁。同时，选举结束后，岸信介公开声称要建立一个所谓“强有力的同美国合作的政府”。另一方面，在美国的驱使下，岸信介和蒋介石、李承晚的勾搭已一天比一天频繁。从这些迹象里，不难看出日本有进一步被拖向危险道路的趋势。
