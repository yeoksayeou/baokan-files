Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, May 7th: U Nu, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, said in a radio address on the evening of May 6th: "The current situation is that the conflicting factions (within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League) have now embarked on an irreversible path of division. In this split, I and my supporters within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League have irrevocably decided to join the faction of Thakin Tin and Thakin Kyaw Tun."

In his speech, U Nu publicly announced for the first time that the opposition faction within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League that opposes the Thakin Tin faction is the faction of U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein.

U Ba Swe, U Kyaw Nyein, and Thakin Tin are all vice-chairmen of the Executive Committee of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. U Nu is the chairman, and Thakin Kyaw Tun is the general secretary.

He said that in order to split peacefully, he made the following suggestions to the U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein faction: the property of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League should be divided equally between the two factions. The Supreme Council of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League will decide which faction is qualified to take over the league. Although the Prime Minister has the power to dismiss cabinet ministers at any time, he is unwilling to exercise this power in the current situation. All ministers will continue to serve until Parliament convenes. He said that during this period, both sides will gather their strength in Parliament. When Parliament convenes, someone may try to overthrow the government led by me. If we fail, we will become the opposition party. If the other side cannot defeat us, they will become the opposition party.

At a press conference on May 7th, U Nu suggested that the Supreme Court establish a commission of inquiry to investigate the behavior of senior leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, including U Ba Swe, U Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Tin, and himself. He said that he and Thakin Tin are willing to be subject to public investigation. He hoped that U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein could make the same decision.

    吴努宣布缅执政党分裂
    据新华社仰光7日电　缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努5月6日晚上发表广播演说时说：“目前的形势是，（反法西斯人民自由同盟内）互相冲突的各派现在已经走上无可挽回的分裂的道路。在这种分裂中，我和反法西斯人民自由同盟内我的支持者们已经无可挽回地决定参加德钦丁和德钦觉顿派。”
    吴努在演说中第一次公开宣布，在反法西斯人民自由同盟内反对德钦丁派的反对派是吴巴瑞和吴觉迎派。
    吴巴瑞、吴觉迎和德钦丁都是反法西斯人民自由同盟执行委员会的副主席，吴努是主席，德钦觉顿是总书记。
    他说，为了和平分裂，他向吴巴瑞和吴觉迎派提出了这样几个建议：反法西斯人民自由同盟的财产在两派之间平分。反法西斯人民自由同盟的最高委员会将决定那一派有资格接管这个同盟。虽然总理有权随时解除内阁部长的职务，但是他不愿在目前情况下行使这种权力。所有部长将继续任职到国会举行会议时为止。他说，在这段时期内，双方将集合他们在国会中的力量。当国会举行会议的时候，可能有人试图推翻我所领导的政府。如果我们失败的话，我们就将成为反对党。如果对方不能击败我们的话，他们就将成为反对党。
    吴努5月7日在记者招待会上建议最高法院成立一个调查委员会，来调查包括吴巴瑞、吴觉迎、德钦丁和他本人在内的反法西斯人民自由同盟高级领袖的行为。他说，他和德钦丁愿意受到公众的调查。他希望吴巴瑞和吴觉迎能够作出同样的决定。
