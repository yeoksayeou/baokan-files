    Should Be Red in the Countryside, Expert in the Countryside

    After reading Comrade Yu Zhiming's letter to the editor, I feel that it actually reflects such a view, namely: "Red in the countryside, expert in the city"; and it seems that "red" can be achieved as long as one labors well for "a year and a half." I don't want to express any opinions on whether "red" can be achieved in "a year and a half," I just want to talk about my views on the issue of being "expert" in the city.

    First of all, I believe that transferred cadres should not only be red in the countryside, but also expert in the countryside. Transferred cadres learning agricultural production and delving into agricultural technology is precisely the only way to become both red and expert. It can help us establish the ideological feelings and noble qualities of loving labor, loving farmers, loving the countryside, and loving the motherland, and transform our thoughts of despising labor, despising workers and peasants, and despising agriculture, thereby further changing our non-proletarian standpoints and viewpoints, and firming up our proletarian standpoints and revolutionary outlook on life. This is the basic requirement of our labor training. However, some transferred cadres do not recognize this. They believe that as long as they are not lazy in their labor, they can become red. They think there is nothing to delve into in the countryside. Therefore, they are not interested in learning and studying agricultural production technology. Some hold on to their professional books and are smug, saying: Red during the day, expert at night. Their logic is that they can only be red in the countryside and not expert. This kind of thinking is the same as Comrade Yu Zhiming's thinking, and obviously does not correctly understand the Party's policy of transferring cadres.

    I feel that a revolutionary cadre should open up his own "red" and "expert" front wherever he is assigned; this is a conscious action of a revolutionary. From two months of labor training in the countryside, I deeply realized that rural knowledge is infinite, and it is full of learning and experience. It is not only a melting pot for "red," but also a good place for "expert." In the past, many problems that were not noticed or considered simple have now become the objects of our study and research. Taking carrying manure as an example, although it largely relies on physical strength, it also has skills and the principles of leverage.

    Secondly, I believe that we should not only be "expert in the countryside," but also combine it with the agricultural production at that time and place and the production tasks assigned by the commune and team, and not be divorced from reality. Only in this way can we more firmly grasp agricultural production technology, promote agricultural production at that time and place and in the commune and team, and also temper our ideological style. Some transferred comrades are very interested in agricultural technology, but they do not study diligently and aim too high. They often study based on their own interests and do not do the work of their own profession. During labor time, when they are supposed to be plowing the ground, they don't do it, but go to other fields to practice harrowing and raking. Some comrades get tired after doing similar work for a few days and think they can't become experts. However, the peasant brothers have been doing these jobs year after year and do not feel bored. On the contrary, because they have been engaged in productive labor for a long time, they have not only mastered rich production experience and skilled agricultural technology, but also cultivated their honest and down-to-earth excellent style. This is exactly what we need to learn from them. From labor training, I also realized that down-to-earth work is not only a process of becoming "red," but also a process of becoming "expert."

    Finally, I also believe that in order to become both red and expert, transferred cadres should not only actively delve into agricultural production technology, but also actively participate in the social activities of the local agricultural cooperative, tell the peasant brothers about socialist construction and socialist revolution, explain the Party's various policies, teach peasants to read, carry out recreational activities, and so on. On the one hand, this can improve the political awareness and cultural level of the peasants and enliven rural cultural life, so as to achieve the goal of transforming the countryside; on the other hand, through the above-mentioned social activities, we can also strengthen extensive contact with the peasant brothers, deepen the revolutionary feelings between each other, and over time, bring about a major change in our thinking, so as to achieve the goal of transforming ourselves.

### 应该红在农村专在农村

    应该红在农村专在农村
    读了余志明同志给编辑部的信，我觉得实际上反映了这样一种观点，即：“红在农村、专在城市”；而且“红”似乎只要“一年半载”劳动得好就可以达到了。对于“红”是否“一年半载”就可达到，我不想发表什么意见，我只想就“专”在城市的问题谈谈我的看法。
    首先，我认为下放干部不仅应该红在农村，而且也应该专在农村。下放干部学习农业生产和钻研农业技术正是红、专的必由之路。它能帮助我们树立热爱劳动、热爱农民、热爱农村、热爱祖国的思想感情和高尚品质，改造我们轻视劳动、轻视工农、轻视农业的思想，从而进一步改变我们的非无产阶级立场、观点，坚定无产阶级立场和革命人生观。这是我们劳动锻炼的基本要求。但是，有的下放干部不是这样认识，他们认为只要自己劳动不贪懒就可以红了，农村是没有什么可钻的，因此，对学习钻研农业生产技术不感兴趣，有的抱着本行业务书不放，还洋洋得意地说：白天红，晚上专。他们的逻辑就是在农村只能红不能专。这种思想和余志明同志的思想是一样的，显然没有正确地理解党的下放干部政策。
    我觉得一个革命干部应该分配到那儿就要在那儿开辟自己“红”“专”的阵地；这是一个革命者的自觉行动。我从农村两个月的劳动锻炼中，深切体会到农村的知识是无穷的，到处充满了学问和经验，不但是“红”的熔炉，也是“专”的好场所。过去有许多不被人注意的问题或认为简单的事情，现在竟成了我们学习和研究的对象。拿担粪来说，虽然很大程度上拼体力，但也有技巧，也有杠杆的原理。
    其次，我认为不但应该“专在农村”，而且还应该结合当时当地的农业生产和社、队分配的生产任务来“专”，不能脱离实际。只有这样，才能更巩固的掌握农业生产技术，也才能促进当时当地和社、队的农业生产，也才能锻炼我们的思想作风。有些下放同志虽然对农业技术很感兴趣，但学习不踏实，好高鹜远，往往单凭兴趣进行学习，不干本行的活。在劳动时间里，本来是刨地，他不干，而去旁的地里去练习耢地、耙地。有的同志多干几天相似的活就厌了，认为专不了。但是，农民兄弟长年累月尽干这些活并没有觉得腻烦。相反的，由于他们长期的从事生产劳动，不但使他们掌握了丰富的生产经验和熟练的农业技术，而且还培养了他们诚朴、踏实的优良作风。这正是我们需要向他们学习的。从劳动锻炼中，我还体会到踏踏实实的工作，不仅是“红”的过程，也是“专”的过程。
    最后，我还认为下放干部要做到又红又专，除了积极地钻研农业生产技术外，还要积极地参加当地农业社的社会活动，给农民兄弟讲社会主义建设和社会主义革命，讲党的各项政策，教农民认字，开展文娱活动等等。这一方面可以提高农民政治觉悟和文化水平，活跃农村文娱生活，达到改造农村的目的；另一方面通过上述社会活动，也可加强与农民兄弟的广泛接触，加深彼此之间的革命感情，久而久之，使自己思想上来一个大转变，可以达到改造自己的目的。
