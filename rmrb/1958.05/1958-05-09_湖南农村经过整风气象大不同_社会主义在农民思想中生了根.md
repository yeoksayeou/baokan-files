Report from our newspaper: Journalists Fu Zhen and Xu Changrong report: Thanks to the deepening of socialist ideology, Hunan is now witnessing a massive upsurge in socialist production and construction, and the mental outlook of the broad masses of farmers has undergone significant changes. These changes are notably manifested in six aspects: first, resolutely taking the socialist road; second, actively participating in collective labor; third, correctly handling the relationship between the individual and the collective; fourth, greatly improved relations between cadres and the masses; fifth, a new social atmosphere is emerging; and sixth, significant changes in the ideological work style of cadres. Recently, Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, received reporters and systematically described the situation in this regard.

"People in the commune, but their hearts are at home," constantly thinking about engaging in spontaneous activities is a thing of the past. The broad masses of farmers are resolutely blocking the capitalist road and are determined to take the socialist road.

Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou said: Hunan experienced a capitalist "disaster" last spring and summer. There were right-wing attacks in the cities, and spontaneous forces were on the rise in the countryside. Some agricultural cooperative members were clamoring to withdraw from the cooperatives, some were unwilling to participate in production within the cooperative, engaging in individual production or speculation, and some, after consuming seven or eight hundred catties of grain, still shouted "grain shortage." In response to these situations, in August of last year, the Provincial Party Committee decided to carry out rectification in the countryside and launched a socialist education movement. With the deepening of this movement, the socialist consciousness of the farmers rapidly increased, the broad masses resolutely took the socialist road, opposed the capitalist road, and proposed many ways to block the capitalist road. For example, the "three-combination" method implemented by the Dacheng No. 1 Cooperative in Yongxing County made specific provisions for the workdays invested by cooperative members, fertilizer investment, and the basic rations left for cooperative members. This method played an extremely significant role in ensuring the collective production of the cooperative, consolidating the cooperative system, and restricting the growth of spontaneous forces. Now, this three-combination method has been promoted throughout the province.

Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou said that after a series of tasks, especially with the vigorous development of agricultural cooperative production, the broad masses of farmers are determined to take the socialist road. Last year, many farmers were "people in the commune, but their hearts were at home." They wanted to rely on their private plots and "spontaneous" activities, so they constantly clamored to withdraw from the cooperatives and shouted "grain shortage." This year, the situation has fundamentally changed. They said that if there was less grain, they would not blame the government or the commune, but only blame the poor production and lack of savings last year. Seeing the huge scale and vigorous prosperity of agricultural cooperative production this year, they firmly linked themselves to the cooperative, placed their hopes in the commune, and also invested their labor and energy in collective labor. Conversely, they felt that private plots were nothing. They said: Now the socialist system has taken root, and there is no second road in front of us. We must move forward on this bright road.

The phenomenon of coming to work late, leaving work early, and resting for two hours in the middle is gone; now it is coming to work early, leaving work late, and even working under the stars.

In terms of work attitude, there is also a big difference between last year and this year. Last year, spontaneous forces were rampant, and many cooperative members were unwilling to work in the agricultural cooperatives. Taking Liling County, which had a relatively high attendance rate, as an example, an average laborer only worked one hundred and forty to fifty days in the commune last year, and even the most active only worked one hundred and seventy to eighty days. Even when working in the agricultural cooperatives, it was "coming to work late, leaving work early, and resting for two hours in the middle." This year, the number of people working in agricultural cooperatives has increased unprecedentedly, and men, women, old, and young have all come out. The total rural population in Hunan Province is 32 million. Last year, the average number of people working in agricultural cooperatives only accounted for slightly more than 20% of the total population, and in some cases, even only 10%. This year, the number of people working in agricultural cooperatives has reached 50% or 60% of the total population. In terms of workmanship quality, last year many places had many people but not unified minds, and some cooperative members were perfunctory, resulting in poor workmanship quality. This year, everyone's labor enthusiasm is very high. They said: We will no longer do "people fooling the land, the land fooling the belly" things. Many cooperative members not only come to work early and leave work late, but even work under the stars, and even carry out production at night. In the construction of water conservancy projects, many city gas lamps are out of stock.

Actively participate in collective labor, regard the property of the commune as their own property, and farmers combine personal interests with collective interests.

In the relationship between the individual and the collective, there is also a clear contrast between last year and this year. Last year, due to the small momentum of production, the province only accumulated 6 billion dan of fertilizer, an average of about 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, of which only about 1 to 2 dan were accumulated fertilizer; also, because some cooperative members applied fertilizer to their private plots, some agricultural cooperatives had "sanitary fields" that were not fertilized at all. This year, in the Great Leap Forward in production, the masses accumulated a large amount of fertilizer. The province has now accumulated 35 billion dan of fertilizer, an average of nearly 600 dan of fertilizer per mu, including more than a dozen dan of refined fertilizer. All these fertilizers have been invested in the collective production of paddy fields and dry land. In terms of protecting public property, last year, some public property of agricultural cooperatives was only used, and no one managed it. Like waterwheels and draught cattle, many were not well managed. This year, cooperative members truly feel that they are members of the agricultural cooperative collective, realize the relationship between the development of the agricultural cooperative and themselves, and naturally combine personal interests with collective interests, so they cherish the property of the agricultural cooperative as their own property.

Some masses used to scold cadres, but now they care about cadres. The masses say that to eat well and dress well depends entirely on the leadership of cadres.

In terms of the relationship between cadres and the masses, this year is much better than last year. Last year, many masses scolded cadres. Of course, some cadres did have problems in their work style, but on the other hand, which is also the main aspect, some people were not yet accustomed to and resisted the socialist system, so they took the opportunity to vent their anger on the cadres. In the rectification, after full airing of views, a commune put forward thousands of opinions. Among these opinions, some criticized the work style of the cadres. The cadres seriously reviewed themselves to the masses and completely changed their work style. Some criticized some of the masses' erroneous understanding of socialism, which also made these masses sober. Cadres' participation in labor has a great impact on the masses. The masses see that the cadres are very hard-working and care about them very much. During the Spring Festival, many masses invited cadres to eat. They said that to eat well and dress well, they must rely on the leadership of cadres.

The phenomenon of quarreling and fighting has been eliminated, political enthusiasm has been enhanced, young people are at ease in the countryside, and girls are willing to marry farmers.

In terms of social atmosphere, in the past, there were many quarrels and fights in the countryside. After the Spring Festival last year, gambling was very prevalent in various places. Now everyone is concentrating on production, and these phenomena have naturally been eliminated. In the past, some people simply did not come to meetings in the commune or township, and some came very late, sometimes the time spent waiting for people was longer than the time of the meeting. This year, when there is something to meet about, not only do people come fully, but they also come quickly. The masses say that to make a great leap forward in thinking, more meetings must be held. At the meeting, the masses can correctly carry out criticism. In the Five-Star Cooperative of Baitian Township, Xiangxiang County, there are a father and son. The son is the production team leader, and the father is a general cooperative member. Once, the production team leader assigned his father to accumulate fertilizer, but his father went to collect firewood for his family. The production team leader raised his opinion to his father at home, but his father did not accept it. In the evening, he raised the criticism at the meeting. He said, at home you are my father and I am your son, and I should listen to you. In the commune, I am the team leader and you are a cooperative member, and you should listen to my assignment. Other cooperative members also pointed out that the cooperative is a large collective, and family affairs are personal affairs, and personal affairs should obey the large collective. In the past, rural youths were not at ease with agricultural production, and rural girls were unwilling to find partners in the countryside. Now these situations have greatly changed. Young people are at ease in rural production, and girls are also willing to marry farmers. In Daxing No. 1 Cooperative in Pingjiang County, which is a mountainous area, seventeen girls have married farmers here in the past few months, which was also rare in the past.

Cadres are no longer wearing shoes, holding notebooks, and walking with an official air; but barefoot and bald, holding hoes, and leading production.

The ideological work style of cadres has also undergone great changes. In the past, some cadres' work style was not down-to-earth and not in-depth. The masses said they were "three-character cadres": wearing shoes, holding notebooks, and walking with an official air. Now, the vast majority of cadres have walked out of the office and eat, live, and work with the masses. This year, a total of 100,000 cadres from the provincial, county, and township levels have been transferred to lower levels, with an average of two or three cadres in each commune, serving as leaders in the commune or participating in labor training. Last year, county and township agencies were in housing shortages; now, most county and township agencies are empty houses. Cadres planting experimental fields has also become a trend. A total of 350,000 cadres in the province have planted 550,000 mu of experimental fields, and they generally do well. Many advanced farming techniques have been promoted by cadres through experimental fields. Through experimental fields, problems have also been discovered and solved in a timely manner, truly driving the masses. Recently, the Xiangtan County Party Committee has combined experimental fields with technology and scientific experiments, which is a very meaningful development and is being prepared for promotion throughout the province. The "three-character cadres" have changed into "three-head cadres." The masses praised them and said: Chairman Mao's land reform cadres are here again. They are barefoot and bald, holding hoes, and leading production!

Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou finally said with particular significance: Although some wealthy middle peasants still deeply regret that they cannot take the capitalist road, they now deeply feel that "this road is not easy to take." Judging from the current situation, if there are no unexpected natural disasters this year, an increase in agricultural production is certain. In this way, people's socialist ideological consciousness will be further enhanced, and socialist construction will advance by leaps and bounds. (Photo attached)

### 湖南农村经过整风气象大不同  社会主义在农民思想中生了根

    湖南农村经过整风气象大不同
    社会主义在农民思想中生了根
    本报讯　记者傅真、徐长荣报道：由于社会主义思想深入人心，湖南正掀起一个声势浩大的社会主义生产建设高潮，广大农民群众的精神面貌发生了重大的变化。这些变化显著地表现在六个方面，即：一、坚决走社会主义道路；二、积极地参加集体劳动；三、正确地处理个人和集体的关系；四、干部和群众的关系大为改善；五、新的社会风气正在出现；六、干部思想作风有了很大转变。最近，中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟同志接见了记者，系统地叙述了这方面的情况。
    “人在社里心在家”，念念不忘搞自发已经是过去的事了，广大农民坚决堵塞资本主义道路，一心要走社会主义道路。
    周小舟同志说：湖南去年春夏有个资本主义“灾”，城市有右派进攻，农村自发势力抬头。农业社员有的人闹退社，有的人不愿参加社内的生产，进行个人的生产或投机活动，有的人吃了七八百斤粮食，还要叫喊“缺粮”。针对这些情况，去年8月，省委决定在农村进行整风，开展了一个社会主义教育运动。随着这个运动的深入展开，农民的社会主义觉悟迅速提高，广大群众坚决走社会主义道路，反对资本主义道路，并且提出了许多办法来堵塞资本主义的道路。如永兴县大城一社实行的“三结合”办法，对社员投入社内的劳动日、肥料投资和留给社员的基本口粮都做了具体规定，这个办法对保证合作社的集体生产、巩固合作社制度、限制自发势力的滋长各方面起了极其显著的作用，现在这个三结合的办法，已在全省范围内推行。
    周小舟同志说，经过一系列的工作，特别是农业社生产蓬勃发展，广大农民都决心走社会主义的道路。去年，不少农民是“人在社里心在家”，他们想依靠自留地，依靠“自发”，所以不断闹退社，喊“缺粮”。今年，情况是根本改观了。他们说，粮食少了，不怪政府不怪社，只怪去年生产不好，没有节约。他们看到今年农业社生产的巨大规模和蓬勃兴旺的气象，因而坚定地把自己和合作社联结了起来，把希望寄托在社里，把劳力和精力也投入到集体劳动中，反过来认为自留地算不了什么。他们说：现在社会主义制度生了根，摆在面前没有第二条路，一定要向这条光明大道前进。
    迟出工、早收工、中间休息两点钟的现象没有了；现在是早出工，晚收工，甚至披星戴月地劳动。
    表现在劳动态度上，去年和今年也有很大不同。去年，自发势力泛滥，许多社员不愿在农业社出工，以出工率较高的醴陵县为例，一个劳动力去年平均只在社内出工一百四五十个，多的也只有一百七八十个。就是在农业社出工时，也是“迟出工，早收工，中间休息两点钟”。今年，在农业社的出工人数空前增加，男女老少都出来了。湖南全省农村人口共三千二百来万，去年一年中，在农业社出工人数平均只占总人口数的20％稍多，少的甚至只有百分之十几。今年，在农业社出工的人数已达到总人口数的50％或者60％。在工夫质量上，去年许多地方是人多心不齐，有的社员敷衍塞责，工夫质量差。今年，大家劳动情绪都很高涨，他们说：再也不干“人哄地皮、地哄肚皮”的事了。许多社员不仅是早出工，晚收工，甚至是披星戴月，夜里还进行生产。在兴修水利工程中，许多城市的煤汽灯都脱销了。
    积极参加集体劳动，把社的财物当自己的财物，农民把个人利益和集体利益结合起来了。
    在个人和集体的关系上，去年和今年也是鲜明的对比，去年，由于生产劲头小，全省只积肥六十亿担，平均计算，每亩田约上肥一百担，其中积肥约一至二担；还因为有的社员将肥料上在自留地里，所以有的农业社就出现了根本不上肥料的“卫生田”。今年，在生产大跃进中，群众大量积肥，全省现已积肥三百五十亿担，每亩平均约可上肥近六百担，其中有精肥十几担。这些肥料都投入到集体生产的稻田和旱土里了。在爱护公共财物方面，去年，农业社一些公共财物只有人用，没有人管。像水车、耕牛有许多管理的不好，今年，社员真正感到自己是农业社集体中的一员，认识到农业社的发展和自己的关系，把个人利益和集体利益自然地结合起来，所以对农业社的财物也像对自己的财物一样地爱护了。
    有些群众过去骂干部，现在关心干部。群众说，要想吃好穿好，全靠干部领导。
    在干部和群众关系上，今年比去年有很大的改善。去年，不少群众骂干部，当然，有些干部作风上确实有毛病，但是另一方面也是主要的方面，却也有一部分人因为对社会主义制度还不习惯和有抵触情绪，所以借机向干部发泄。在整风中，经过大鸣大放，一个社提了几千条意见。在这些意见中，有批评干部作风问题的，干部认真向群众检讨，彻底改变自己的作风。有批评一些群众对社会主义的错误认识的，也使这些群众清醒过来。干部参加劳动，对群众影响很大。群众看见干部很辛苦，对干部非常关怀，春节时，许多群众请干部吃饭，他们说：要想吃好穿好，就要靠干部领导。
    吵嘴打架现象消除了，政治积极性增强了，青年安心在农村，姑娘愿意嫁农民。
    在社会风气方面，过去，农村里打架吵嘴现象不少，去年春节以后，各地赌风很盛，现在大家都把精力集中在生产上，这些现象都自然地消除了。过去，社里、乡里开会有的人根本不来，有的人来得很迟，有时等人的时间比开会的时间还长。今年，有事开会时，不但人来得齐，而且来得快。群众说：要思想大跃进，就要多开点会才行。在会议上，群众能够正确地开展批评。湘乡白田乡五星社有父子两人，儿子是生产队长，父亲是一般社员。一次，生产队长分配他的父亲去积肥，可是，他的父亲却给自己家里去打柴。生产队长在家里向他父亲提出意见，他的父亲不接受，晚上，他就在会上提出批评，他说，在家你是父亲，我是儿子，我应当听你的，在社里，我是队长，你是社员，你应当听我的分配。别的社员也提出，合作社是个大集体，家里的事是个人的事，个人的事应当服从大集体。过去，农村青年不安心农业生产，农村姑娘不愿在农村找对象。现在这些情况都大大改变了，青年们安心在农村生产，姑娘们也愿意和农民结婚。平江县大兴一社是个山区，几个月来就有十七个姑娘和这里的农民结婚，这在过去也是少有的事。
    干部不再是脚穿鞋子、手拿本子、走路是官架子；而是赤脚光头，手拿锄头，生产带头。
    干部思想作风，也有了很大的转变。过去，有些干部的作风不踏实，不深入。群众说他们是“三子干部”：脚穿鞋子，手拿本子，走路是官架子。现在，广大干部都走出办公室，和群众同吃，同住，同劳动。今年，全省的省、县、乡三级干部共下放了十万人，平均每个社都有两三个干部，担任社里的领导工作，或参加劳动锻炼。去年，县乡机关都闹房荒；现在县乡机关多是空房。干部种试验田，也成了风气。全省三十五万个干部，共种了五十五万亩试验田，而且一般都做得很好。许多先进耕作技术，都是干部通过试验田推广的。通过试验田，也及时发现和解决了问题，真正带动了群众。最近，湘潭县委把试验田和技术、科学试验结合起来，这是一个很有意义的发展，准备要在全省推广。“三子干部”一变而为“三头干部”，群众赞扬说：毛主席的土改干部又来了，他们是赤脚光头，手拿锄头，生产带头！
    周小舟同志最后特别深有意义地说道：现在虽然还有一些富裕中农对不能走资本主义道路仍然深致惋惜，但是他们现在已经深深地感觉到“此路不大好走”了。从现在情况看来，今年如果不遇意外灾荒，农业增产是可以肯定的。这样，人们的社会主义思想觉悟将会更加提高，社会主义的建设将会大踏步前进。（附图片）
