　　Shandong Criticizes the Right-Leaning Ideology of Simply Waiting for Mechanization
　　Mobilizes the Masses to Create Urgently Needed Tools
    Gansu Peasants Create Over 10,000 Types of Mountain Tools
    (From Our Newspaper) The Shandong Provincial People's Committee held a province-wide conference on the promotion of simple water-lifting tools and improved farm implements from the 7th to the 10th of this month. The conference, after seriously criticizing the rather widespread right-leaning and conservative thinking in various places of simply waiting for mechanization and not paying attention to mobilizing the masses to create and promote simple water-lifting tools and improved farm implements, decided to immediately launch a mass movement throughout the province to create and promote simple water-lifting tools and improved farm implements in order to solve the current urgent needs for water-lifting tools, summer harvesting and planting tools, transportation tools, and tools needed for farmland water conservancy construction.
    The conference put forward the "four on-the-spots" principle of obtaining materials locally, manufacturing locally, promoting locally, and using locally for how to promote simple water-lifting tools and improved farm implements in the future. It required all localities to adhere to the principles of easy manufacturing, low cost, high efficiency, and ability to reduce physical labor, as well as creating, trial-producing, and using simultaneously. Through holding on-site meetings and mass debates and other methods, a mass movement to promote simple water-lifting tools and improved farm implements should be quickly launched. (Wang Ying)
    (From Our Newspaper) Since Gansu Province launched the movement for everyone to reform tools, in just a few months, the masses in various places have created 11,000 kinds of new tools, mainly for use in mountainous areas.
    The cultivated land area in mountainous areas of Gansu Province accounts for 84% of the total cultivated land area of the province. Although more than 300,000 pieces of new agricultural implements have been promoted in recent years, human carrying and the "two oxen lifting the pole" plow still exist in large numbers. Under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, in order to solve the problem of insufficient labor and backward production tools in arid mountainous areas, the masses in various places enthusiastically created and reformed new tools. Jiang Yunzhong of Gangu County created an artificial rainfall machine, which can irrigate 40 mu of land per day, so that the slopes that could not be irrigated by canals and cellars can also be irrigated. Liu Zhongqin of Jingyuan County created a three-purpose seed drill for water, fertilizer, and seeds, which overcame the difficulties of drought resistance and sowing in mountainous areas this spring. Chen Jie of Qin'an County invented the animal-powered wheeled Chen Luo mill, which only requires one person to watch, and one animal to pull two grinding discs, the efficiency is equivalent to seven people and six animals, and it can also automatically sweep, automatically screen, and automatically load, effectively solving the problem of grain processing for the masses in mountainous areas. In addition, the creation of new tools such as high-line automatic transporters, canal cranes, tampers, and hand-cranked manure crushers can increase labor efficiency by several times to dozens of times.
    In the tool reform movement, party committees at all levels in Gansu Province, headed by the party secretary himself, grasped ideology, grasped typical examples, solved the difficult problems in the tool reform, and praised and supported the invention and creation activities of the masses through various forms. The province, special districts, and counties respectively held tool reform exhibitions, promotion meetings, symposiums, and experience exchange meetings, organized evaluations and observations, and promoted them on the spot. At the same time, research institutions for tool reform were established to introduce advanced tools from other places and guide the creation of new tools, and a large number of technicians and mobilized teachers and students went deep into the countryside to study and create new tools with the peasants.

### 山东批判单纯等待机械化右倾思想  发动群众创制当前急需工具  甘肃农民创造山地工具一万多种

　　山东批判单纯等待机械化右倾思想
　　发动群众创制当前急需工具
    甘肃农民创造山地工具一万多种
    本报讯　山东省人民委员会7日到10日召开了全省推广简易提水工具和改良农具会议。会议在严肃地批判了各地较为普遍存在的单纯等待机械化，而不注意发动群众创造和推广简易提水工具和改良农具的右倾保守思想的基础上，决定立即在全省范围内掀起一个群众性的创造和推广简易提水工具和改良农具运动，以解决当前迫切需要解决的提水工具、夏收夏种工具、运输工具和农田水利建设需要的工具等方面的困难。
    会议对今后如何推广简易提水工具和改良农具工作，提出了就地取材、就地制造、就地推广和就地使用的“四就”方针，要求各地本着制造容易、成本低、效率高又能减轻体力劳动和边创造、边试制、边使用的原则，通过召开现场会议和群众辩论等办法，迅速掀起一个群众性的推广简易提水工具和改良农具运动。　（王影）
    本报讯　甘肃省自从发起人人动手改革工具运动以后，在短短的几个月中，各地群众创造出以山地使用为主的新工具一万一千种。
    甘肃省山区耕地面积占全省耕地总面积的84％，几年来虽然推广了三十余万件新农具，但是，人背肩挑和“二牛抬杠”犁仍然大量存在。在大跃进的新形势下，为解决干旱山区劳动力不足和生产工具落后的问题，各地群众便热火朝天地创制和改制新工具。甘谷县蒋蕴中创造的人工降雨机，一天浇地四十亩，使原来渠窖浇灌不到的山坡地也能得到灌溉之利。靖远县刘忠勤创造的水粪籽三用耧，克服了今春山区抗旱播种的困难。秦安县陈杰发明的畜力车轮陈箩磨，只要一个人看，一头牲口拉两矿磨，效率相当于七个人力和六头畜力，还能自动扫，自动筛，自动装，有效地解决了山区群众粮食加工的问题。此外，像高线自动运输器，渠道起重机、打夯机、手摇碎粪机等新工具的创造，可提高劳动效率几倍到几十倍。
    甘肃省各级党委在改革工具运动中，由党委书记亲自挂帅，抓思想、抓典型，解决改革工具中的困难问题，通过各种形式表扬和支持群众的发明创造活动。省、专区和县分别召开了工具改革展览会、促进会、座谈会和经验交流会，组织评比观摩，现场推广。同时成立改革工具的研究机构，介绍外地先进工具与指导创制新工具，并派出大批技术员和发动教员、学生深入农村，与农民研究创造新工具。（翟其寅）
