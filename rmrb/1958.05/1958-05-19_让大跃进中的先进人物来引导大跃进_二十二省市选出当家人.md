Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Currently, twenty-two provinces and cities across the country have completed grassroots elections. Shanghai, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, four provinces and cities currently conducting grassroots elections, will also complete them all before the end of May.

The district jurisdictions, townships and ethnic townships, towns, and other grassroots units in various localities that have completed elections have all convened the first meeting of the Third People's Congress, and elected new members of the People's Committee and representatives to the county-level People's Congress. In areas where election work is progressing faster, nearly three hundred county-level units have completed election work.

During the election days, cities and villages were filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, a festive atmosphere everywhere. Inspired by the rectification movement and the great leap forward in production, voters have very high political enthusiasm. They cherish their democratic rights even more and actively participate in election activities. Many voters in Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places who were away from home also wrote letters or sent telegrams to participate in the voting. The proportion of voters participating in the election is generally higher than in 1956. In six counties and cities in Liaoning Province, including Shenyang, Anshan, and Fengcheng, the proportion of voters participating in the election averaged 98.1%. In Chongqing, more than 99% of voters cast their ballots, and in 373 electoral districts, the proportion of voters participating in the election reached 100%.

This year, many areas used methods of full airing of views and posting of big-character posters to put forward many criticisms and opinions on government work, and used this method to select and identify representative candidates. Many areas also launched a "compare stances, compare thoughts, compare work, compare production, compare connections with the masses" evaluation campaign when discussing representative candidates. Among the newly elected people's representatives, there are many labor models, activists and other advanced figures who emerged in the rectification movement and the great leap forward in socialist construction. In Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, a total of 1,605 township and town people's representatives were elected, of which production models and activists accounted for approximately 40%. Among the 246 people's representatives elected in Hedong District, Tianjin, approximately 51% were outstanding figures who emerged during the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, and in the great leap forward in production. For example, Liu Shulan, a stem-removing worker at the cigarette factory, is a labor model in Tianjin. Since 1953, she has not produced a single unqualified product for five consecutive years. During the "double-anti" movement, she led workers to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, enabling the entire work section to produce more than 120 batches of superior products in the first quarter. In this election, voters in the cigarette factory unanimously elected her as a district people's representative. Guangzhou also elected many production innovators who dared to think and dare to act as people's representatives. For example, Li Guangyao, a member of the Tongjian Camphor Production Cooperative, a newly elected people's representative from the southern district of the city, worked hard for seven days and nights during this year's great leap forward in production, making the quality of camphor exceed international standards.

After the rectification and anti-rightist struggles, voters' vigilance has been improved. When examining voter qualifications, they exposed the sabotage activities of some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and some were deprived of their right to vote according to law. During the election period, people's courts in some areas also sent people to grassroots units to form people's tribunals to handle issues related to voter qualifications and voter appeals, protecting voters' democratic rights and exerting the power of the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　让大跃进中的先进人物来引导大跃进
　　二十二省市选出当家人
    新华社18日讯　目前全国已有二十二个省市完成基层选举。正在进行基层选举的上海、云南、新疆、青海四个省市，也将在5月底以前全部完成。
    各地已完成选举的市辖区、乡和民族乡、镇等基层单位，都召开了第三届人民代表大会第一次会议，选出了人民委员会的新的组成人员和县人民代表大会代表。在选举工作进行较快的地区，已有近三百个县级单位完成了选举工作。
    在选举的日子里，在城市和乡村，到处是锣鼓喧天，喜气洋洋。选民们经过整风运动和在生产大跃进形势的鼓舞下，政治热情很高，他们更加珍视自己的民主权利，积极参加选举活动。广州、天津等地许多外出的选民，还写信或打电报回来参加投票。选民们参加选举的比例一般地都比1956年高。辽宁省的沈阳、鞍山、凤城等六个县市，选民参加选举的比例平均达到了98.1％。重庆市有99％以上的选民投了票，并有三百七十三个选区选民参加选举的比例达到100％。
    许多地区的选民今年用大鸣大放、贴大字报办法，对政府工作提出了很多批评和意见，并用这种办法，挑选和鉴别代表候选人；许多地区在讨论代表候选人时，还展开了“比立场、比思想、比工作、比生产、比联系群众”的评比运动。在新选出的人民代表中，有许多是在整风运动和社会主义建设大跃进中涌现的劳动模范、积极分子等先进人物。吉林省蛟河县共选出乡、镇人民代表一千六百零五名，其中生产模范、积极分子约占40％。天津市河东区选出的二百四十六个人民代表中约有51％是在整风和反右派斗争中，在生产大跃进中，涌现出来的优秀人物。如卷烟厂除梗工人刘淑兰是天津市劳动模范，从1953年以来连续五年没有出过一次不合格的产品。在双反运动中，她带动工人比先进、学先进、赶先进，使整个工段在第一季度中出现了一百二十多次优等品。这次选举，卷烟厂选民一致选她为区人民代表。广州市还选出了许多敢想、敢干的生产革新者当人民代表，如这个市的南区新选出的人民代表、同建樟脑生产合作社社员李广耀，在今年生产大跃进中苦战七昼夜，使樟脑的质量超过了国际水平。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，选民们的警惕性提高了。在审查选民资格时，他们揭发出一些地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动，有些被依法剥夺了选举权。有些地区的人民法院在选举期间，还派人到基层单位组成人民法庭处理有关选民资格和选民上诉等问题，保护了选民的民主权利，发挥了人民民主专政的威力。
