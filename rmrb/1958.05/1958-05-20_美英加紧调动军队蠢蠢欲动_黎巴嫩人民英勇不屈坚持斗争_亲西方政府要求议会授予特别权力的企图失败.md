Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 19th: Despite American interference, the rebellious people of Lebanon continue their heroic struggle against the pro-Western current government.

　　The general strike and market strike in Beirut have continued for a week. As of today, most shops remain closed. Gunfire is heard from time to time in the city. A huge explosion occurred near the port of Beirut this morning.

　　News received in Damascus states that as of the afternoon of May 18th, the people and government security forces in Tripoli and the Al-Shouf region were still engaged in fierce fighting. Damascus Radio said on the evening of May 18th that the people in the Tripoli region had seized three armored vehicles from government troops.

　　According to Damascus newspapers today, the insurgents in Tripoli are now working to eliminate the extremely reactionary National Socialist Party members in the city. The People's Court has sentenced three National Socialist Party members to death for killing two children during the conflict in the city.

　　Reports from Sidon, Tyre, Nabatieh, and Bint Jbeil indicate that strikes and market strikes are continuing, and traffic between these cities and Beirut has been cut off because bridges and roads have been blown up.

　　With the support of the United States, the Lebanese government continues to brutally suppress patriotic people. In Beirut, government security forces raided civilian houses on May 18th, killing more than fifty residents, including many women, children, and elderly people.

　　The Lebanese government attempted to convene a parliamentary session on the evening of May 17th to grant it special powers, but the meeting failed to achieve a quorum and did not take place. A statement issued by the opposition said that this was because people had lost confidence in the government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: Washington news: The United States and Britain are intensifying troop movements in an attempt to use force to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs and intimidate the Lebanese people who are safeguarding national sovereignty and independence.

　　Two of the US Air Force's eighteen C-124 troop transport planes had already flown to West Germany on the 18th, landing at the US Air Force base at Rhein-Main in Frankfurt, West Germany. The rest will arrive in West Germany one after another. According to a local Air Force spokesman, the US planes will be "ready to fly to Lebanon" if the situation there "deteriorates."

　　In addition, there are reports that a US fleet of twelve ships is already stationed near Lebanon. This fleet has at least one thousand US Marines on board.

　　The British Mediterranean Fleet Headquarters announced on the evening of May 18th that British ships had been anchored at "various stations in the Eastern Mediterranean." It also said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization fleet exercise scheduled to begin on the 19th had been "rearranged" so that the British Mediterranean Fleet could sail to the vicinity of Lebanon.

　　News from Cyprus indicates that the Tymbou heavy airport on the island will be used as a base for intervention in Lebanon.

    贝鲁特的总罢工、罢市已经继续了一星期，到今天为止，大多数商店仍然关门停业。市内不时听到枪声。今天早上贝鲁特港附近又发生巨大爆炸。
    在大马士革得到的消息说，到18日下午为止，的黎波里和阿勒—舒弗地区的人民和政府保安部队仍然在进行激烈的战斗。大马士革电台18日晚间说，的黎波里地区的人民从政府军队手里缴获了三辆装甲车。
    据大马士革报纸今天报道，的黎波里的起义者现在正在进行肃清这个城市中的极端反动的国家社会党党徒的工作。人民法庭已将三名国家社会党徒判处死刑，因为他们在这个城市发生冲突期间杀害了两个儿童。

    黎巴嫩政府在美国的支持下继续对爱国人民进行残酷镇压，贝鲁特的政府保安部队18日袭击了民房，有五十多名居民被杀害，其中有不少是妇女、儿童和老人。
    黎巴嫩政府曾经企图在17日晚间要议会开会授予它特别权力，但是由于未能凑足法定人数，会议没有开成。反对派发表的一项声明说，这是因为人们对政府已经失去信心。

    另外有消息说，在黎巴嫩附近已经驻有美国的一支由十二艘舰只组成的舰队。这支舰队至少拥有一千名美国海军陆战队人员。
    英国地中海舰队总部18日晚宣布，英国舰只已经停泊在“地中海东部的各站”。它还说，预定在19日开始的北大西洋公约组织舰队的演习已经“重新作了安排”，以便英国的地中海舰队开到黎巴嫩附近。
    来自塞浦路斯的消息说，这个岛上的泰姆包重型机场将被用作干涉黎巴嫩的一个基地。
