    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: At a meeting held today, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party decided to issue an appeal to the Japan Socialist Party, various trade groups, labor unions, and cultural organizations, calling for joint action to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and restore normal relations in Sino-Japanese trade.
    The content of this appeal was released at a press conference held by the JCP today. The appeal stated that Sino-Japanese trade has reached its most serious state due to the Nobusuke Kishi government's unfriendly policy towards China and its undermining of Sino-Japanese trade agreements. The appeal stated that Japanese trade will face a long-term crisis, which will be a serious blow to small and medium-sized enterprises and their workers, as well as other relevant parties.
    The appeal pointed out that this is entirely due to the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China. Therefore, the Nobusuke Kishi government must be overthrown.
    This appeal will soon be delivered to the leaders of the Japan Socialist Party and various organizations.

    日共呼吁社会党和工会等团体
    联合起来打倒岸信介政府
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央常任干部会在今天举行会议上，决定向日本社会党、各贸易团体、工会和文化团体等发出呼吁书，呼吁展开联合行动，以打倒岸信介内阁，恢复日中贸易的正常关系。
    这项呼吁书的内容已经在今天由日共举行的记者招待会上发表，呼吁书说，由于岸信介政府对中国采取不友好政策和破坏日中贸易协定，日中贸易已经出现了最严重的局面。呼吁书说，日本的贸易将面临长时期的危机，这对中小企业和它们的工人以及其他各有关方面将是严重的打击。
    呼吁书指出，这完全是由于岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策所招致的。因此必须打倒岸信介政府。
    这项呼吁书即将递交给日本社会党和各团体负责人。
