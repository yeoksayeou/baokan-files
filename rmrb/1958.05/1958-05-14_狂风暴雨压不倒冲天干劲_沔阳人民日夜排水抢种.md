Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 13th: Mianyang County, Hubei Province, which was recently severely hit by gales and torrential rain, has basically returned to normal production order after ten days of intense and arduous struggle. At present, most of the houses in some areas of the county that were blown down by strong winds have been repaired; most of the accumulated water in summer harvest crops, cotton fields, and seedling fields has been drained. The farmers of Mianyang County, who have been fighting against the wind and rain for days, are now racing against time day and night to plant, replant, and transplant seedlings, striving to achieve this year's agricultural production increase plan. The number of people in the county engaged in rush planting and replanting every day has reached more than 100,000. Up to now, farmers have replanted more than 20,000 mu of middle rice and single-season late rice seedlings on the fields that have just been drained, and transplanted early rice on more than 40,000 mu. The replanting of cotton has ended, and more than 300,000 mu of cotton have been thinned. More than 500,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the county have also been ditched for drainage.

During the gale and torrential rain, leading cadres at all levels immediately went deep into the disaster areas and drained water, rushed to plant, and replanted with the disaster victims. Ma Jie, the first secretary of the county party committee, led more than 20 cadres to Caiyuan Township and Duliu Township on the evening of the disaster, braving the rain to direct the rescue of seedlings. When Jiang Zuoqiang, the deputy county magistrate, arrived at Wangchang Township that night, it was already 3:30 in the morning. At this time, the torrential rain was still pouring down. Seeing that more than 20 mu of seedling fields in Hexing Cooperative would be completely submerged, he led the members to rescue them and was the first to jump into the water, digging mud and building ridges, persisting until dawn. In these days, many cadres wore raincoats and walked barefoot all day long, leading everyone to drain water, replant, and transplant seedlings. These have played a great role in stabilizing the emotions of the masses and inspiring the morale to overcome natural disasters.

During the flood season, non-disaster-stricken cooperatives also actively supported the heavily disaster-stricken cooperatives.

　　狂风暴雨压不倒冲天干劲
　　沔阳人民日夜排水抢种
    据新华社武汉13日电　不久前遭到狂风暴雨严重袭击的湖北沔阳县，经过十来天的紧张而艰苦的战斗，现已基本恢复正常的生产秩序。目前，这个县部分地区被大风吹倒了的房屋大部业已修整；夏收作物、棉田以及秧田中的积水大部分已经排出。连日与风雨搏斗的沔阳县农民，现在正夜以继日地抢插抢种，补苗移栽，力争实现今年农业增产规划。全县每天投入抢插抢种的人数达十万人之多。到目前止，农民已在刚排出渍水的田地上，补种中稻和一季晚稻秧苗二万多亩，插早稻四万多亩。棉花补种已经结束，并且有三十多万亩棉花间了苗。全县有五十多万亩夏收作物也进行了开沟滤水。
    各级领导干部在狂风暴雨袭击时立即深入灾区，与灾民一道排渍抢插抢种。县委第一书记马杰在受灾的当天晚上，带领了二十多名干部，冒雨赶到菜园乡和杜柳乡，指挥抢救秧苗。副县长姜作强当晚赶到王场乡时，已经是深夜三点半钟了，这时倾盆大雨仍然倒个不止，眼看合兴社有二十多亩秧田就将全部被淹，他带领社员急忙抢救，并且自己第一个跳下水中，挖泥筑埂。一直坚持到天亮。在这些日子里，许多干部成天披着蓑衣、赤着脚，带领大家排渍、补种、插秧。这些都对稳定群众情绪，鼓舞战胜自然灾害士气，起了很大作用。
    防汛期间，非灾社也积极支援重灾社。
