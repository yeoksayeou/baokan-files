Xinhua News Agency, 30th – According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of the end of March, the number of hogs raised nationwide reached 163,730,000, already exceeding the state plan for hog production this year by 9.2%. Currently, the national number of hogs is advancing towards the goal of over 200 million.

The first quarter of this year saw a leap in the number of hogs. 1957 was a year of relatively rapid development for hogs; the end of March last year saw an increase of 3% compared to the end of December 1956; while the end of March this year saw an increase of 12.2% compared to the end of December 1957, more than tripling the rate of development. Due to the large increase in the number of hogs, the national average number of hogs raised per farmer household has increased from 0.8 at the end of March 1957 to 1.3; the average number of hogs raised per hundred mu of cultivated land has also increased from six to 9.8.

However, looking at the situation in various regions, the development of the number of hogs nationwide is still very uneven. Guangdong Province, which has the fastest development, saw an increase of 39% in the number of hogs at the end of March compared to the end of December last year. Guizhou and Henan provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region all increased by more than 20%; while Beijing and Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Zhejiang and other provinces not only did not increase, but actually decreased compared to the end of December 1957. At the same time, the number of hogs raised collectively by agricultural cooperatives has not made much progress. According to statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, the number of hogs raised by agricultural cooperatives at the end of March this year only accounted for 10.1% of the total number of hogs in these provinces and cities, an increase of only 1.6% compared to the end of December 1957. In the context of the great development of hog production, increasing the proportion of hog raising by agricultural cooperatives is a matter worthy of attention in the current development of hog production, and this issue has already received the attention of leaders in various localities.

### 生猪生产超额完成今年计划  农业社集体养猪比重还需注意提高

    生猪生产超额完成今年计划
    农业社集体养猪比重还需注意提高
    新华社30日讯　据农业部最近统计，截至3月底全国养猪头数达到一亿六千三百七十三万头，已提前超额9，2％完成今年生猪生产的国家计划。目前全国养猪头数正向两亿头以上的目标前进。
    今年第一季度生猪头数有了飞跃的发展。1957年是生猪发展较快的一年；去年3月底比1956年12月底增加3％；而今年3月底却比1957年12月底增加12.2％，发展速度加快了三倍多。由于生猪头数大量增加，全国平均每户农民养猪头数已由1957年3月底的零点八头增加到一点三头；平均每百亩耕地养猪头数也由六头增加到九点八头。
    但是从各个地区情况来看，全国生猪头数发展得还很不平衡。发展最快的广东省，3月底生猪头数比去年12月底增加39％，贵州、河南两省和内蒙古自治区都增加20％以上；而北京市和陕西、甘肃、山东、浙江等省不仅没有增加，反而比1957年12月底减少了。同时，农业社集体养猪头数也进展不大，据河北等十六个省、市统计，今年3月底农业社养猪头数只占这些省、市生猪总头数的10.1％，仅比1957年12月底增加1.6％。在生猪大发展的情况下，提高农业社养猪的比重，是目前发展生猪生产中值得注意的事，这个问题已经受到各地领导的重视。
