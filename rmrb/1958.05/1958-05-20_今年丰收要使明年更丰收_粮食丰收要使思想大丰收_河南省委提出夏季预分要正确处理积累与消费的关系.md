This Newspaper Reports: According to the Henan Daily, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently issued "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in Summer Pre-Distribution."

The instructions first pointed out that the wheat harvest is approaching, and the broad masses are looking forward to a bumper harvest. How to lead the masses to harvest well and distribute well is of decisive significance for further encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production and promoting the continuous development of the all-round Great Leap Forward. For this reason, the Provincial Party Committee has given principled instructions on this year's summer pre-distribution work:

The instructions said that correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption is the central link in doing a good job in summer pre-distribution and ensuring a bumper harvest throughout the year. Through publicizing the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," we should loudly put forward the slogan of "hard struggle for three years, expanding public accumulation, expanding reproduction, and storing more reserve grain" among the masses. After airing views, debating, and discussing, most of the increased production should be used as public accumulation for expanding reproduction, and a small portion should be distributed to commune members to improve their lives, in order to accelerate socialist agricultural construction.

The instructions also said that conscientiously implementing the policy of distribution according to work and rationally sorting out work points are the basic guarantees for improving commune members' enthusiasm and creativity in labor. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses, inspect and revise labor quotas, and correct some unreasonable phenomena of high or low work points. Labor for various farmland capital construction projects can generally participate in pre-distribution. Work points for supporting production and construction in other areas and other communes, and work points for non-direct production, can generally be shared out. Which ones participate in distribution and which ones are shared out should be discussed with the masses. The remuneration for nursery staff, midwives, and volunteer teachers in the commune should generally be shared by the beneficiaries, or appropriate subsidies can be given from the public welfare fund. Commune members who delay work due to various inventions and creations should be compensated for their work, and those who succeed in inventions and creations should be rewarded. The remuneration of commune members engaged in special technical production should not be less than that of upper-middle-level labor.

The instructions said that this year's summer production tasks are exceptionally tight and arduous. Therefore, to do a good job in summer pre-distribution, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, follow the mass line, and launch extensive debates among the masses to discuss how to distribute, how to expand public accumulation, and how to distribute quickly and well. It is also necessary to correctly implement the reward and punishment system, according to the spirit of "more rewards and fewer punishments." At the end of pre-distribution, the results of pre-distribution should be announced to the commune members, and new production tasks should be arranged to further launch a production competition upsurge of "learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced."

The instructions finally pointed out that pre-distribution work is not only a meticulous and complex economic work, but also an extremely important political work. Through summer pre-distribution and grain purchase work, we should further raise the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members, criticize capitalist, individualist, and departmentalist ideas, prevent concealment of output and private distribution, and establish a good distribution order. Party committees at all levels must pay close attention to the leadership of pre-distribution work, formulate plans and make arrangements as early as possible, so that pre-distribution work and summer harvesting and planting are closely integrated and promote each other, and the grain purchase work and summer pre-distribution work are unified, calculated together, and resolved at once.

　　今年丰收要使明年更丰收
    粮食丰收要使思想大丰收
    河南省委提出夏季预分要正确处理积累与消费的关系
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：最近，中共河南省委发出了“关于做好夏季预分工作的指示”。
    指示首先指出，目前，麦收将届，广大群众眼望着丰收，如何领导群众收得好，分得好，对于进一步鼓舞群众生产热情，促进全面大跃进的高潮持续发展，具有决定的意义。为此，省委对今年夏季预分工作作了原则性的指示：
    指示说，正确处理积累和消费的关系是搞好夏季预分工作，保证全年大丰收的中心环节。通过宣传“多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游”建设社会主义的总路线，在群众中响亮提出“苦战三年，扩大公共积累，扩大再生产，多搞储备粮”的口号，经过鸣放辩论，把增产的大部分作为公共积累用于扩大再生产，小部分分给社员改善生活，以加速社会主义的农业建设。
    指示又说，认真贯彻执行按劳取酬政策，合理清理工分，是提高社员劳动积极性和创造性的基本保证。因此，必须深入发动群众，检查修订劳动定额，纠正记工中的某些偏高偏低的不合理现象。对于各种农田基本建设用工，一般均可参加预分。支援外地外社生产建设的工分，和非直接生产的工分一般可以推摊。究竟那些参加分配，那些推摊，都要与群众商量。社内保育员、接生员、义务教员的报酬，一般应由受益者分摊，也可以从公益金中给以适当补助。社员因各种创造发明误工者，应当补工，创造发明成功者，并要给以奖励。从事特种技术生产的社员，其劳动报酬不得少于上中等劳动力。
    指示说，今年夏季的生产任务异常紧张和繁重，因此，要做好夏季预分工作，要充分发动群众，走群众路线，发动群众广泛展开辩论，讨论如何分配，如何扩大公共积累，如何分配的快、分配的好。并要正确地贯彻执行奖惩制度，根据“多奖少罚”的精神。预分结束时，要向社员公布预分结果，布置新的生产任务，进一步掀起“学先进、比先进、赶先进”的生产竞赛热潮。
    指示最后指出，预分工作，不仅是一项细致复杂的经济工作，而且是一项极其重要的政治工作。通过夏季预分和粮食征购工作，进一步提高广大社员的社会主义觉悟。批判资本主义、个人主义、本位主义思想，防止瞒产私分，建立良好的分配秩序。各级党委必须切实重视预分工作的领导，及早地定出计划，作好安排，使预分工作和夏收夏种密切结合，互相促进，把粮食征购工作和夏季预分工作，统一安排，统一计算，一次解决。
