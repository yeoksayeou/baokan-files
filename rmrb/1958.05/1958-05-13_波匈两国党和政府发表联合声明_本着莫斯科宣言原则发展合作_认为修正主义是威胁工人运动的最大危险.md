　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 12th: A joint statement signed yesterday by the delegations of the Polish Party and Government and the Hungarian Party and Government was released here today.

    The joint statement said that the talks between the two delegations, conducted in a cordial and friendly atmosphere, exchanged views on the most important issues concerning the current international situation, the international working-class movement, and the development of relations between Poland and Hungary, and reached a complete consensus on all the issues discussed.

    The statement said that the two countries believe that countries with different social systems should practice peaceful coexistence. The two countries fully support the initiatives and activities of the Soviet Union, other socialist countries, and peace forces around the world aimed at halting and eliminating the arms race and establishing relations based on mutual trust between countries. They fully support the Soviet government's initiative to hold a summit meeting. At the same time, they believe that the attempt by certain reactionary and imperialist forces in the West to include issues related to the systems of European People's Democracies on the meeting agenda is irresponsible and a manifestation of attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries.

    Both sides believe that the key issue in the current international situation is eliminating the threat of atomic war. Both sides affirmed their full support for the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing. Both sides also believe that the practice of arming West Germany with atomic and rocket weapons in Europe is particularly dangerous.

    The joint statement emphasized that the Hungarian government fully supports Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone. The two delegations believe that until a collective security system is established, the Warsaw Pact, which is purely defensive, must continue to serve as a necessary guarantee for the security of socialist countries.

    The statement continued that the goal of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is to develop cooperation between the two parties in the spirit of the principles stipulated in the Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto of the twelve Communist and Workers' Parties.

    The Polish delegation was pleased to see the achievements made by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in overcoming the serious difficulties caused by domestic and foreign reactionary forces, who had exploited past mistakes to incite counter-revolution against the people's regime.

    Both sides believe that in order to consolidate world peace, the unity of socialist camp countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism is extremely important. Unity and a permanent alliance with the Soviet Union, the first and most powerful socialist country in the world, is a fundamental factor for the common security and independence of socialist countries. Both parties resolutely oppose revisionism, believing that revisionism is the greatest danger threatening the workers' movement; both parties also resolutely oppose dogmatism and sectarian tendencies that isolate the party from the masses.

    The two delegations expressed their belief that the continued bilateral contacts between the Polish United Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, multilateral meetings of Communist and Workers' Parties when necessary, and the exchange of information and experience are important factors in strengthening and consolidating our friendship and fraternity.

    The two delegations stated that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between Poland and Hungary should continue to exist in order to facilitate the development of comprehensive friendly relations between Poland and Hungary. The two delegations also expressed their desire to further develop economic relations between the two countries.

    The two delegations believe that, in addition to the long-term trade agreement for 1958 to 1960 signed in March of this year, it is necessary to conclude several other protocols and to draft and sign a general trade agreement by the end of this year stipulating mutual deliveries of basic goods from 1961 to 1965. The two delegations agreed that the two governments will establish a Polish-Hungarian Economic Cooperation Committee in the near future. Both sides decided to conclude agreements on legal assistance, social welfare and insurance, and a consular treaty to further develop mutual relations and cooperation between the two countries.

    The statement concluded that the two delegation are deeply convinced that the visit of the Polish Party and Government delegation to Hungary will greatly enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples and will further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 11th: Thousands of working people in Budapest gathered at the gymnasium today to welcome the Polish Party and Government delegation. Kadar and Gomulka spoke at the meeting respectively.

    In his speech, Kadar pointed out that in 1956, the imperialists had illusions about the riots in Poland and directly aided the Hungarian counter-revolution. After the failure of the Hungarian counter-revolution, they also attempted to provoke relations between the Polish and Hungarian parties and between the two countries. Therefore, the visit of the Polish Party and Government delegation has special significance. Now there is further understanding between the two countries. The enemy's attempt to sow discord in Polish-Hungarian friendship will not succeed. Because the current Polish-Hungarian friendship is a genuine and sincere friendship between the people, we are raising the internationalist banner of the Polish and Hungarian workers, peasants and intellectuals who are loyal to socialism.

    Kadar said that the October counter-revolutionary events gave us a lesson. We believe that the main enemy of the international workers' movement today is revisionism.

    In his speech, Kadar also expressed support for Poland's struggle against West German militarism and supported Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.

    In his speech, Gomulka conveyed the congratulations of the Polish Party, government, and people to the Hungarian working people. Speaking of the friendship between the two peoples, he said that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Poland and Hungary has become the foundation for the establishment of new relations between the two peoples. He emphasized that whatever helps strengthen the Hungarian People's Republic also helps strengthen socialism worldwide.

    Gomulka then talked about the situation of socialist construction in Poland. He pointed out that revisionism had caused some ideological confusion within the Polish Party and has become the most important danger. Gomulka also talked about the issue of the unity of socialist countries.

　　波匈两国党和政府发表联合声明
    本着莫斯科宣言原则发展合作
    认为修正主义是威胁工人运动的最大危险
    据新华社布达佩斯12日电　今天这里发表了波兰党和政府代表团和匈牙利党和政府代表团昨天签署的一项联合声明。
    联合声明说，两个代表团在亲切友好的气氛中进行的会谈，就当前国际局势、国际工人阶级运动以及波匈两国关系发展的最重要问题交换了意见，并且在所讨论的一切问题上都取得了完全一致的看法。
    声明说，两国认为具有不同社会制度的国家应当实行和平共处。两国完全支持苏联、其它社会主义国家和全世界和平力量的目的在于制止和消除军备竞赛以及建立以各国之间互相信任为基础的关系的倡议和活动。它们完全支持苏联政府关于举行最高级会议的倡议。同时，它们认为，西方的某些反动势力和帝国主义势力企图把有关欧洲人民民主国家的制度的问题列入会议议程，这是不负责任的，是企图干涉这些国家的内政的表现。
    双方认为，目前国际局势中的关键问题是消除原子战争的威胁，双方肯定它们完全支持苏联最高苏维埃关于单方面停止核武器试验的决定。双方还认为在欧洲以原子武器和火箭武器武装西德的做法是特别危险的。
    联合声明强调说，匈牙利政府完全支持波兰关于建立无原子武器地区的建议。两国代表团认为，在集体安全制度建立以前，完全是防御性的华沙条约必须继续作为社会主义国家的安全的必要保证。
    声明接着说，波兰统一工人党和匈牙利社会主义工人党的目标是本着十二国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言和和平宣言规定的原则的精神发展两党之间的合作。
    波兰代表团满意地看到匈牙利社会主义工人党在克服国内外反动势力造成的严重困难方面取得的成就，这些反动势力曾经利用过去的错误煽动反对人民政权的反革命。
    双方相信，为了巩固世界和平，建立在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的社会主义阵营国家的团结一致是十分重要的。同世界上第一个、也是最强大的一个社会主义国家苏联团结一致和结成永久的联盟是社会主义国家的共同安全和独立的基本因素。两党都坚决反对修正主义，认为修正主义是威胁工人运动的最大危险；两党也坚决反对教条主义和使党同群众隔离的宗派主义倾向。
    两国代表团表示相信，波兰统一工人党和匈牙利社会主义工人党继续进行双边接触、共产党和工人党在必要时举行多边会议、以及交换情报和交流经验是加强和巩固我们的友谊和兄弟情谊的重要因素。
    两国代表团声明，波兰和匈牙利的友好合作互助条约应当继续存在下去，以利于发展波兰和匈牙利之间的全面友好关系的事业。两国代表团还表示要进一步发展两国经济关系。
    两国代表团认为，除了在今年3月签订的1958年至1960年的长期贸易协定之外，有必要另行缔结几个议定书，并且在今年年底以前拟就并且签订一项规定从1961年到1965年相互交付基本货物的一般贸易协定。两国代表团同意，两国政府在最近将成立一个波匈经济合作委员会。双方决定缔结关于法律协助、社会福利和保险的协定以及缔结一项领事条约，以便进一步发展两国的相互关系和合作。
    声明最后说，两个代表团深信波兰党和政府代表团对匈牙利的访问将大大加强两国人民的传统友谊，并且将更加巩固社会主义阵营的团结。
    新华社布达佩斯11日电　布达佩斯劳动群众数千人今天在体育馆集会欢迎波兰党和政府代表团。卡达尔和哥穆尔卡在会上分别讲了话。
    卡达尔在讲话中指出，1956年帝国主义者对波兰的暴乱抱着幻想，并直接帮助了匈牙利反革命。在匈牙利反革命失败后还企图挑拨匈波两党和两国间的关系。因此，波兰党和政府代表团的来访就有着特别的意义。现在两国间已经有了进一步的了解。敌人挑拨波匈友谊的企图是不会得逞的。因为现在的波匈友谊是真正的人民之间的诚挚的友谊，我们举起的是匈波工人、农民和忠实于社会主义的知识分子的国际主义的旗帜。
    卡达尔说，十月反革命事件给了我们教训，我们认为，国际工人运动当前主要的敌人是修正主义。
    卡达尔在讲话中还表示支持波兰反对西德军国主义的斗争，支持波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中向匈牙利劳动人民转达了波兰党、政府和人民的祝贺。他在谈到两国人民的友谊时说，波匈友好合作互助条约成了两国人民建立新关系的基础。他强调指出，凡是有助于加强匈牙利人民共和国的事情同样也有助于加强全世界的社会主义。
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到了波兰社会主义建设的情况。他指出，修正主义在波兰党内曾引起某些思想上的混乱，它成为最主要的危险。哥穆尔卡还谈到社会主义国家的团结问题。
