    We have a total of twenty or thirty people, big and small, old and young, in our courtyard. Others call us "Unity Courtyard." Indeed, our whole courtyard is like a big family.

    After the rectification and great debate in the neighborhood, we understood that unity and mutual assistance can not only improve household affairs but also allow our loved ones to work and produce with peace of mind; we understood that "unity is strength."

    In the morning, just as everyone is tidying up their houses, Chen Zengshu's clear voice comes from the courtyard: "I'm going to buy groceries, does anyone want to come along?" By the time Chen Zengshu brings back the groceries for several families, Sister-in-law Sun, Sister-in-law Qin, and others have already swept the courtyard clean. Someone has already lit the stove for Chen Zengshu's family, and the fire is burning brightly.

    Grandma Jia is old, so everyone doesn't let her do strenuous work like fetching water or emptying dirt. However, the old lady doesn't sit idle either. She boils water, pot after pot, and always fills everyone's thermos bottles. At the end of last month, the machine-made coal briquettes were delivered, and they asked which family wanted them. Everyone didn't have any extra money on hand and said they didn't need them. Sister-in-law Sun, who had some extra money, quickly went into the house and took out ten yuan, saying, "I have money here. You can buy them, so the coal briquette deliveryman doesn't have to make another trip!"

    Whenever someone in the courtyard is sick, everyone rushes to take care of them. I remember one day last year when it was drizzling, Chen Zengshu got sick, and her son wasn't home. The room was crowded with people from the same courtyard. Everyone felt that she needed to be sent to the hospital. Sister-in-law Sun, even though she was pregnant, volunteered to send Chen Zengshu to the hospital.

    Because everyone has exerted the power of unity and mutual assistance, they are able to complete the tasks assigned by the neighborhood committee very well. Everyone feels that the rectification is really good. It has raised ideological understanding and further strengthened unity. (Attached photo)

### “团结院”更加团结

    “团结院”更加团结
    前门区裘家街棉花下四条三号院　刘冰清
    我们院里大大小小、老老幼幼共有二、三十人，别人都叫我们“团结院”。的确，我们全院真像个大家庭。
    经过街道整风大辩论，我们懂得了团结互助既能搞好家务，又能使自己的亲人安心生产安心工作；懂得了“团结就是力量”。
    早晨，各家正在收拾屋子的时候，从院子里传来了陈增淑清脆的声音：“我去买菜啦，谁有带的？”等陈增淑把好几家的菜买回来时，孙大嫂、秦大嫂等早已把院子打扫得干干净净，陈增淑她家的炉子已有人代她生好，火烧得旺旺的。
    贾奶奶年岁大了，大家不让她干打水、倒土等用力气的活，但是，老奶奶也不闲着，左一壶、右一壶地烧开水，把各家的暖水壶总是灌得满满的。上月底，送机器煤球的来了，问谁家要？大家手头都没有余钱，都说不要，手头有余钱的孙大嫂连忙去屋里拿出十块钱来，说：“我这儿有钱，你们买吧，免得送煤球的再跑一趟了！”
    只要院子里有人病了，大家就抢着照顾。记得去年有一天正下着蒙蒙雨，陈增淑病了，她儿子也不在家，屋里挤满了同院的人。大家觉得需要送医院，孙大嫂虽然怀着孩子，但是自告奋勇送陈增淑进医院。
    由于大伙发挥了团结互助的力量，对于居民委员会布置的工作，都能够很好的完成。大伙感到整风真正好，提高了思想认识，又进一步增强了团结。（附图片）
