Only Actively Developing Production Can Solve the Difficulties in the Great Leap Forward in Production
　　Wu Lü
　　The Great Leap Forward in local industry is now encountering some difficulties. One of them is the shortage of raw materials. For example, in Shaanxi Province, according to preliminary estimates, there is a shortage of more than 50,000 tons of steel, more than 60,000 tons of iron, and a large amount of cement and wood.

　　Faced with such difficulties, is there a solution? Yes. One solution is to use the perspective of developing production to solve the difficulties in production. Isn't there a shortage of raw materials? Then, we should strengthen the construction of raw material industries as soon as possible, build small-scale indigenous blast furnaces, build low-grade cement plants, and so on. Shaanxi Province's vigorous development of local heavy industry is to solve the difficulty of raw materials. This method is worth promoting.

　　The perspective of developing production has always been one of the fundamental perspectives of our Party's economic policy. Comrade Mao Zedong's two excellent articles, "Be Concerned with Economic Work" and "The Economic Problem and Financial Problem in the Anti-Japanese War," fully embody this perspective. This perspective of developing production is completely a Marxist perspective. Marxists believe that productive forces are the most active factor in social development, and the proletarian revolution is to change the old relations of production and establish new relations of production to suit the development of productive forces. After the proletariat seizes power, the important task also lies in developing productive forces, strengthening the material foundation of the new social system, and enabling productive forces to develop more rapidly. The red areas during the domestic revolutionary war, and the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, although they only solved the problem of the proletariat seizing power in local areas, and although they were still faced with serious military wars and had no possibility to completely solve the shackles of the old relations of production on productive forces, they still regarded developing productive forces as an important task. With the development of productive forces and the improvement of social production, the regime can be consolidated and the victory of the revolutionary war can be materially guaranteed.

　　However, this perspective of developing production is not easily accepted. For example, during the Anti-Japanese War, when the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was in financial difficulty, some comrades only circled around the simple issue of financial revenue and expenditure, trying to solve the financial difficulty by contracting financial expenditures, but they did not know that the quality of financial policy could certainly affect the economy, but it was the economy that determined finance. Only by developing the economy can the financial difficulties be fundamentally solved.

　　Reviewing these historical experiences, establishing the perspective of developing production, and understanding how to use the perspective of developing production to solve production and financial difficulties still has very significant practical significance for today's economic work. Because today, not everyone has the perspective of developing production, especially when encountering certain difficulties in the economy, this perspective is even completely forgotten. Some comrades' erroneous "anti-adventurism" in the second half of 1956 violated the policy of developing production.

　　Seeing a slight deficit in finance, they contract production; seeing that certain raw materials are in short supply, they also contract production. What does this mean? It means that the development of production is only possible after there is enough capital, enough raw materials, and everything is prepared perfectly. Our country's economy is backward, capital is always limited, and raw materials are always insufficient. If this is the case, can't we never develop production?

　　Using the perspective of developing production to deal with difficulties in capital and raw materials leads to completely different conclusions. We acknowledge that developing production requires capital and raw materials. But we also acknowledge that only by developing production can we accumulate more capital and produce more raw materials. Whether or not one has the perspective of developing production is the touchstone for distinguishing promoters and obstructors. Understanding how to use the perspective of developing production to solve difficulties in production can be universally beneficial; attempting to solve difficulties in production by reducing production is never possible.

　　Because the economy is backward, we must develop production to prosper the economy; because there is insufficient capital, we must develop production to accumulate capital; because there is a shortage of raw materials, we must develop production to increase the production of raw materials. This is the unity of opposites. We are pleased to see that more and more comrades understand this dialectic and have clarified the perspective of developing production. Shaanxi Province's vigorous development of raw material industries is one example.

    只有积极发展生产，才能解决生产大跃进中的困难
　　吴滤
    地方工业的大跃进，现在遇到一些困难。其中之一，就是原材料不足。如陕西省，据初步估计，共缺五万多吨钢，六万多吨铁，还缺大量的水泥、木材。
    面对着这样的困难，有没有办法呢？有。办法之一，就是用发展生产的观点去解决生产中的困难。不是原材料不足吗？那么，就尽快加强原材料工业的建设，搞小型土高炉，搞低标号水泥厂等等。陕西省大力发展地方的重工业，就是为了解决原材料的困难。这个办法值得提倡。
    发展生产的观点，从来就是我党经济政策的根本观点之一。毛泽东同志两篇卓越的论文：“必须注意经济工作”和“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”，充分地体现了这种观点。这个发展生产的观点，完全是马克思主义的观点。马克思主义者认为生产力是社会发展中最积极的因素，无产阶级革命，是为了改变旧的生产关系，建立新的生产关系，使之适合生产力的发展，无产阶级夺取政权之后，重要的任务也在于发展生产力，壮大新的社会制度的物质基础，使得生产力能够得到更快的发展。国内革命战争时期的红色区域，抗日战争时期和解放战争时期的解放区，虽然只解决了局部地区无产阶级夺取政权的问题，虽然还面临着严重的军事战争，还没有可能来彻底解决旧的生产关系对生产力的束缚，但同样要把发展生产力当作一个重要任务。生产力发展了，社会生产提高了，政权才能巩固，革命战争的胜利才有物质保证。
    但是，这个发展生产的观点，并不是很容易就被接受的。例如当抗日战争时期，陕甘宁边区财政困难的时候，有些同志就只在单纯的财政收支问题上打圈子，企图用收缩财政开支的办法去解决财政困难，却不知道财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济。只有发展经济才能根本解决财政困难。
    重温这些历史经验，树立发展生产的观点，懂得用发展生产的观点去解决生产上的、财政上的困难，对于今天的经济工作，仍然有着十分重大的现实意义。因为今天发展生产的观点也不是人人都具有了的，特别是在经济上遇到某些困难的时候，这种观点甚至完全被人忘却了。1956年下半年有些同志错误地进行“反冒进”，就是违背了发展生产的方针。
    见财政上有少许赤字，就收缩生产，见某些原材料供不应求，也收缩生产。这是什么意思呢？意思是：发展生产只有在有了足够的资金，足够的原材料，一切都准备完善之后才有可能。我们的国家经济落后，资金总是有限的，原材料也总是不足的，照这样看来，我们岂不是永远也不能发展生产了吗？
    用发展生产的观点，来对待资金上的、原材料上的困难，就得出完全不同的结论。我们承认发展生产需要资金、需要原材料。但是我们更承认只有发展生产才能积累更多的资金，生产更多的原材料。有没有发展生产的观点，是区别促进派和促退派的试金石。懂得用发展生产的观点去解决生产中的困难，可以无往而不利；企图用缩小生产的办法来解决生产中的困难，则是永不可能的。
    因为经济落后，才要发展生产来繁荣经济；因为资金不足，才要发展生产来积累资金；因为原材料不足，才要发展生产来增产原材料。这是对立的统一。我们欣喜地看到已经有愈来愈多的同志懂得了这个辩证法，明确了发展生产的观点。陕西省大力发展原材料工业就是其中一例。
