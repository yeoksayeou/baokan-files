Tree Planting

Column: Streets and Alleys

Resident Committee member Auntie Zhuang got up early and, along with Auntie Jin and Old Gong, led the tree-planting team towards the Bell Tower. Suddenly, a little-footed old lady, carrying a coal shovel, rushed over from the west, running and shouting, "You didn't call me, but I insist on coming! I'm going to plant two trees to show you all!" Everyone laughed and said, "Come on! Come on! You're welcome!"

Upon reaching the destination, the strong young men shouted loudly, "Let's have a competition! See who can plant trees the fastest, the most, and the best..." The girls were not convinced and, before he could finish, said, "Okay! Let's compete!" The little-footed old lady also said, "This old woman wants to compete with you too!"

Now, under the low wall of the Bell Tower, locust trees, lilacs, and pearl bushes have been planted. How happy the residents here must be, living in an environment they have greenified themselves!

    植树
    居民委员庄大妈一早起来，就和金大妈、老龚率领植树小组向钟楼出发了。突然一位小脚大娘拿把煤铲子，从西边赶来了，连跑带喊的说：“你们不叫我，我偏要来，倒要栽两棵树给你们看看。”说得大伙都笑了说：“来！来！欢迎你。”
    到了目的地，身强力壮的小伙子们大声直嚷：“咱们来比赛呀！看谁的树种得又快又多又好……”姑娘们不服气，没等他说：“嗯！比就比吧！”小脚大娘也说：“我老人家也要和你比一比呢！”
    现在钟楼矮墙下，已经栽起了槐树、丁香和珍珠梅了。这儿的居民生活在自己绿化的环境中，该是多么快活啊！
