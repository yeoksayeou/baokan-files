A Note

    Nixon's "Mistake"
    According to American news agencies, U.S. Vice President Nixon, when meeting with faculty and student leaders of the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, said that "the United States has made mistakes in its policies toward Latin America in the past," and that the United States "may also make mistakes in the future."
    These are two truths. One immediate piece of evidence is: Nixon said at a press conference that "the United States approves of the steps to merge the Latin American economy into a common market similar to the European Common Market." For the people of Latin American countries, this is one of the "mistakes" made by the United States. This kind of "common market" with U.S. participation, which reduces or even eliminates tariffs, only makes it easier for the U.S. to shift its economic crisis and make the economies of Latin American countries even more subordinate to U.S. interests.
    It seems that the United States is very willing to continue to make this kind of "mistake."

### 尼克松的“错误”

    尼克松的“错误”
    据美国通讯社报道，美国副总统尼克松在会见阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯大学教职员和学生领袖时说，“美国过去在对拉丁美洲的政策中犯过错误”，而且他还说，美国“在今后也可能犯错误”。
    这是两句实话。眼前证据之一就是：尼克松在一次记者招待会上说，“美国赞成把拉丁美洲经济合并成一个和欧洲共同市场相类似的共同市场的步骤”。这对拉丁美洲各国人民说来，就是美国犯的“错误”之一。这种有美国参加的、减低关税甚至没有关税的“共同市场”，只不过是更便于美国转嫁经济危机，并使拉丁美洲各国的经济更加从属于美国的利益罢了。
    看来，美国是很愿意继续犯这种“错误”的。
