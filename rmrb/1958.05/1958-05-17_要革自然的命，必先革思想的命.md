　　To Revolutionize Nature, We Must First Revolutionize Thought
　　Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee
　　Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao over the past three years, we have achieved significant accomplishments in both socialist revolution and socialist construction. By continuously overcoming the various difficulties posed by nature, Gansu has transformed from a historically grain-deficient province into a grain-surplus province. The threat of drought that has plagued the people of Gansu for thousands of years will soon disappear forever!
　　Looking back at the path Gansu has taken in socialist construction over the past three years, we have deeply realized the great significance of "ideological work and political work always being the soul and commander of all work." Facts have taught us that to transform society and carry out socialist revolution, we must put politics and ideology in command; similarly, to transform nature and carry out socialist construction, we must also put politics and ideology in command. People are always a decisive factor. To transform society, we must first transform people's thoughts; to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize people's thoughts. Without the liberation of people's minds and the unleashing of people's enthusiasm, it is unimaginable to build socialism, to correctly understand nature, and to transform nature on a large scale. The facts of the past few years have repeatedly proven this truth.
　　Before the autumn of 1955, when right-leaning conservative thinking was prevalent, Gansu's agricultural cooperativization faltered like a woman with bound feet. After the autumn, following Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, we concentrated on criticizing the main manifestation of right-wing opportunist thinking in Gansu – the "Gansu backwardness theory." A revolution in thinking immediately sparked a high tide of socialist transformation, which then developed into a high tide of socialist construction. During the construction high tide of 1956, over 4.3 million mu of irrigated land were developed, exceeding the total for the six years after liberation. One-third of the province's drought-stricken villages basically escaped the threat of drought, and total grain output increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
　　However, this ideological revolution was not thorough. The criticism of the "Gansu backwardness theory" was not deep or penetrating enough. Therefore, in May 1956, right-leaning thinking resurfaced. Right-wing elements inside and outside the Party took advantage of individual shortcomings in our work and launched a massive attack on the Party. They said that "the five million mu of irrigated land were exchanged for human lives" and were "Qin Shi Huang grinding the people"; that all the work in 1956 was "rashly advanced" and that "technical reform measures were ruined," and that these "were all caused by the leadership's hotheadedness"; that criticizing the "Gansu backwardness theory" was "shooting at a non-existent target"; and that the district committee secretary conference held in the spring of 1956 was a "rash advance" meeting, and so on. Amid this clamor, some people within the Party with serious right-leaning thoughts echoed and sang a different tune. Under these circumstances, although the provincial party committee's leadership core insisted on criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and the correct line of criticizing the "Gansu backwardness theory," and opposed the "anti-rash advance" slogan they put forward, they made some concessions to right-leaning thinking, given that most comrades were in an unconscious state. This concession was quickly exploited by right-wing elements who still held Party membership, and they launched an organized and planned attack on the Party. As a result, the achievements of 1956 could not be affirmed, and the tasks for 1957 could not be assigned. The provincial party committee originally planned to develop three million mu of irrigated land in 1957, but due to their opposition, the target could not be set for a long time. After four provincial party committee meetings, it was finally set at 1.35 million mu. Even then, only 75% of the target was completed. Facts have proven that in ideological struggles, a forceful counterattack must be launched against all anti-Marxist-Leninist ideas at any time. Mere defense or concession will inevitably lead to retreat. If the proletariat does not occupy the ideological front, the bourgeoisie will, and there is no vacuum.
　　After the nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, especially after conveying the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and after clearing out the right-wing anti-Party clique headed by Sun Diancai (former Standing Committee member and Deputy Governor of the Provincial Party Committee), Chen Chengyi (former Secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Party Group and Deputy Governor), and Liang Dajun (former member of the Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the Yinchuan Prefectural Party Committee), the situation changed dramatically. A magnificent high tide of socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. The results of water conservancy projects in the first six months of 1958 are equivalent to ten times that of 1957. The original wish to basically get rid of the threat of drought in ten years now seems to be achievable in just three years of hard work.
　　In recent months, with the deepening of the "double anti" movement, the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres for building socialism has risen unprecedentedly. Things that they did not dare to think about in the past, they dare to think about now. Things that they did not dare to do in the past, they dare to do now. Things that they thought would take a long time to accomplish in the past, they are now accomplishing in a short period of time. The Party's leadership is like a neutron, allowing the atomic energy of cadres and the masses to be released in large quantities. Now, the working people of the province are marching towards nature with heroic spirit. From cities to the countryside, there is a new atmosphere of construction everywhere. The speed of development is like ten thousand horses galloping, and the richness and color are like a hundred flowers blooming. Since the water conservancy high tide in October of last year, there have been successive high tides of accumulating manure, planting trees and grass, establishing local industries, improving farm tools, and eliminating the "four pests" while studying culture, forming an overall great leap forward in socialist construction. Two-thirds of the province's counties have announced that they will achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu this year. The central mountainous area is opening up the more than 2,000-li Yintao Project. The Hexi Corridor is building a 3,000-li green Great Wall. By the end of April, more than 10 million mu of new irrigated land had been developed, more than 28 million mu of trees had been planted, more than 24,000 square kilometers of soil and water had been conserved, and more than 3,000 new local industrial plants and mines had been put into production. Technical inventions and creations and tool improvements and innovations have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain. These vivid facts show that 1958 will undoubtedly be a year of unprecedented great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and all kinds of work.
　　The path we have experienced in the past three years is like this. To sum up, this path is: leap forward - slackening - leap forward. This path is also a process of continuous struggle between two lines: one is the correct line that reflects objective laws, striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, and going all out; the other is the line that violates objective laws, striving for less, slower, worse, and more expensive results, and being content with backwardness. This obvious contrast eloquently proves that without an ideological revolution, it is impossible to revolutionize nature. Only when people's minds are liberated can they become masters of nature and promote the great development of social productive forces, and the great development of social productive forces will inevitably in turn promote further liberation of people's minds.
　　People's thoughts often lag behind the development of the objective situation, and this situation is even more obvious during the period of socialist construction. However, within the Gansu Party organization, an extremely erroneous argument has long been circulating, as if only surpassing reality is subjectivism, and lagging behind reality does not count as subjectivism. In practical work, they advocate "everything comes slowly", believing that "slow is better than fast", and "if you go too far to the left, you will cause trouble, but if you go too far to the right, it doesn't matter much". In their views on people, they always regard those with serious right-leaning thoughts as people who "grasp policy well and are stable", while they regard some people with vitality and drive as "simple, impatient" and "reckless". This argument is actually the "air raid shelter" and "amulet" of right-leaning conservative thinking, and must be criticized.
　　Now, the most pressing task facing the Gansu Party organization is to further carry out the ideological revolution. According to our typical investigation, the ideological situation of cadres at the county, township, and commune levels in implementing the general line of building socialism falls into the following four categories:
　　The first category is those who are full of confidence, brave and resourceful, dare to boldly imagine, and dare to let go and mobilize the masses. This category accounts for about 30%.
　　The second category is those who actively support but lack methods and cannot deploy their work. This category accounts for about 40%.
　　The third category is those who are skeptical, hesitant, and full of doubts, watching as they go. This category accounts for about 20%.
　　The fourth category is those who are passive in attitude, seriously infected with "five airs," and have a declining will. They believe that everything has "reached its peak", saying that we have "committed the 'rash advance' error of 1956 again," and even that eliminating the "four pests" is also "leftist." And they proclaim, "We'll settle the score after the autumn harvest." This category accounts for about 10%.
　　This shows that the struggle has not ended, and ideological revolution must be continuously carried out.
　　We thank those of the “settle the score after the autumn harvest” faction for issuing us the warning signal. Having this opposing side allows us to better grasp ideology, grasp measures, and grasp new things so that we can conscientiously and earnestly realize various indicators and certainly beat them when settling the score after the autumn harvest. The current problem is that party organizations at all levels must closely rely on the 30% of people, support all their initiatives, specifically help the 40% of people liberate their minds, trust the masses, learn skills, and do their work well. For the 20% of people who hold skeptical attitudes, we must adopt the method of unity-struggle-unity to push them forward. The remaining 5% to 10% of people, although small in number, have a considerable impact, which we cannot ignore. We must fully mobilize the masses, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, continue to adopt the methods of great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters, launch a communist ideological liberation movement, thoroughly burn away the three winds and five airs, and strive for the complete victory of the rectification movement. Currently, the outstanding problem in industrial and agricultural production is that measures cannot keep up with the targets. In order to solve this problem, we have launched a mass comparison movement throughout the province focusing on comparing hard work, comparing measures, comparing progress, and comparing practical results. Through mutual inspection, on-site comparison, and grasping both ends to bring along the middle, we can do both the rectification and production with equal vigor.
　　The weapons for carrying out the ideological revolution must be obtained from two aspects: one is theory, and the other is practice. In order to better closely integrate theory and practice, we must also pay attention to work methods and learning methods. That is: in terms of theory, we must constantly study Marxism-Leninism, especially diligently study Chairman Mao's works. Only in this way can we continuously acquire the theoretical weapons for correctly understanding the objective world and transforming the objective world. In the past, we did very poorly in this regard, often unconsciously taking many detours. Looking back and carefully studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we suddenly feel enlightened. In terms of practice, the main thing is to go deep into the masses, rely on the masses, and resolutely overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism.
　　Our country is a "poor and blank" country, and Gansu is even poorer and blanker. Thus, on the one hand, the task of changing the social landscape and changing the natural landscape is particularly arduous; on the other hand, the people's demand to change the "poor" and "blank" situation is even more urgent. As long as we continuously carry out ideological revolution, continue to carry forward the revolutionary courage of communists, boldly imagine, work hard in a down-to-earth manner, and let go and mobilize the masses, we can overcome all difficulties and build a new socialist Gansu with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 要革自然的命，必先革思想的命

　　要革自然的命，必先革思想的命
　　中共甘肃省委第一书记　张仲良
    三年来，我们在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，不论在社会主义革命或社会主义建设方面，都取得了重大的成就。由于不断地战胜了大自然给我们造成的种种困难，甘肃已由历史上的缺粮省变成了余粮省。几千年来，甘肃人民遭受的干旱威胁，将要永远地消逝了！
    回顾三年来甘肃在社会主义建设方面所经历的道路，使我们深深地体会到“思想工作和政治工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅”的伟大意义。事实教育我们：改造社会，进行社会主义革命，要政治思想挂帅；同样，改造自然，进行社会主义建设，也必须政治思想挂帅。人，始终是一个决定性的因素，要改造社会，必先改造人们的思想；要革大自然的命，必先革人们思想的命。没有人的思想解放，没有人的积极性的发挥，要建设社会主义，要正确认识自然和大规模的改造自然，是不可想像的。几年来的事实反复地证明了这一真理。
    1955年秋季以前，当右倾保守思想严重的时候，甘肃的农业合作化像小脚女人一样摇摆不前；秋季以后，我们根据毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和七届六中全会的精神，对右倾机会主义思想在甘肃的主要表现形态——“甘肃落后论”，进行了集中的批判。思想上革了一次命，立即掀起了社会主义改造高潮，接着发展为社会主义建设高潮。在1956年建设高潮中，兴修了水地四百三十多万亩，超过了解放后六年的总和，全省三分之一的干旱乡，基本上摆脱了干旱的威胁，粮食总产量也较上一年增长了31％。
    但是，这次思想革命是不彻底的，对“甘肃落后论”的批判还不深不透，因此，到了1956年5月间，右倾思想又重新抬头。党内外的右派分子便利用我们工作中的个别缺点，大肆向党攻击。说“五百万亩水地是人命换来的”，是“秦始皇磨民”；说1956年的各项工作都“冒进了”，“技术改革措施搞坏了”，这些“都是领导上脑袋发热造成的”；说批判“甘肃落后论”是“无的放矢”；说1956年春季召开的区委书记会议是一个“冒进”会等等。在这一片叫喊声中，党内一些有严重右倾思想的人，也随声附和，同唱反调。在这种情况下，省委领导核心虽然坚持了批判右倾保守思想，坚持了批判“甘肃落后论”的正确路线，并反对了他们所提出的“反冒进”的口号。但是鉴于当时大多数同志处于不自觉状态，对右倾思想又作了某些让步。这个让步很快地被当时还挂着党员称号的右派分子所利用，有组织、有计划地向党展开了进攻。以致1956年的成绩肯定不下来，1957年的任务布置不下去，省委原计划1957年兴修水地三百万亩，由于他们的反对，很长时间定不下来，经过四次省委会议，最后才定为一百三十五万亩。即使这样，也只完成了75％。事实证明：在思想斗争中，对于一切反马克思列宁主义的思想，都必须随时进行有力的反击；只是单纯的防御，或者让步，必然就要败退。思想阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级必去占领，真空是不存在的。
    经过全民整风运动和反右派斗争，特别是经过了传达八届三中全会的精神，在党内清除了以孙殿才（原省委常委、副省长）、陈成义
  （原政法党组书记、副省长）、梁大均（原省委委员、银川地委第一书记）为首的右派反党集团，情况大变。一个波澜壮阔的社会主义建设高潮，一日千里地向前迈进。1958年的水利工程六个多月的成绩就等于1957年的十倍。原来准备十年基本上摆脱干旱威胁的愿望，现在看来，只要苦战三年就可以实现。
    近几个月来，结合双反运动的深入开展，广大群众和干部建设社会主义的积极性又进一步空前高涨起来。过去不敢想的事情敢想了，过去不敢做的事情敢做了；过去认为长期办不到的事情，现在短期内就办成了。党的领导更像中子一样，使干部和群众的原子能就大量地放射出来。现在，全省劳动人民正以豪迈的气概向大自然进军，从城市到农村，到处是一片新的建设气象，发展速度有如万马奔腾，丰富多采，有如百花齐放。从去年10月份的水利高潮开始，相继出现了积肥高潮、植树种草高潮、兴办地方工业高潮、改良农具高潮、除四害学文化高潮等，形成了社会主义建设的全面大跃进。全省已有二分之一的县宣布，要在今年亩产达到四百斤，中部山区正在开辟两千多里的引洮工程；河西走廊正在营造三千里的绿色长城。到4月底，已新修水地一千多万亩，植树造林二千八百余万亩，保持水土二万四千余平方公里，新办的地方工业，已有三千多个厂矿投入生产。技术上的发明创造，工具上的改良革新，像雨后春笋一样涌现出来。这些生动的事实，说明1958年无疑的将是工农业生产和各项工作空前大跃进的一年。
    三年来我们经历的道路就是如此。这条道路概括地说来，那就是：跃进——松劲——跃进。这条道路也就是两条路线不断斗争的过程：一条是正确地反映了客观规律的多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游的路线；一条是违反客观规律的少慢差费，甘于落后的路线。这个明显的对比，雄辩地证明：没有思想上的革命，就不可能革大自然的命。只有人们的思想解放了，才能成为自然界的主人，才能促进社会生产力的大发展，而社会生产力的大发展，又必然会反过来促使人们思想上进一步的解放。
    人们的思想，往往落后于客观形势的发展，这种情况在社会主义建设时期更为明显。可是，在甘肃党组织内，却长期流传着一种极其错误的论调，仿佛只有超越了现实才是主观主义，而落后于现实就不算主观主义。在实际工作中主张“一切慢慢来”，认为“慢比快好”，“左了会出乱子，右了关系不大”。在对人的看法上，总是把有严重右倾思想的人，当作是“掌握政策稳”的人；而把一些有朝气、有干劲的人，却认为是“简单急躁”、“冒失鬼”。这种论调实际上就是右倾保守思想的“防空洞”和“护身符”，必须加以批判。
    现在，摆在甘肃党组织面前最迫切的任务，就是要进一步进行思想革命。根据我们的典型调查，目前县、乡、社三级干部中对执行建设社会主义总路线的思想状况，有以下四类：
    第一类，信心充沛，有勇有谋，敢于大胆设想，敢于放手发动群众。这类人约占30％。
    第二类，积极拥护，但缺少办法，工作上摆布不开。这类人约占40％。
    第三类，将信将疑，欲行又止，疑虑重重，边走边看。这类人约占20％。
    第四类，态度消极，五气严重，意志衰退。他们认为一切都“到顶了”，说我们“又犯了1956年的‘冒进’错误”，甚至“除四害”也“左”了。并且扬言“秋后再算账”。这类人约占10％。
    这就说明，斗争并没有结束，还须不断地进行思想革命。
    我们感谢那些“秋后算账派”向我们发出的警号，有了这个对立面，就可以使我们更好地抓思想、抓措施、抓新生事物，以便切实认真地实现各项指标，在秋后算账时一定算赢他们。现在的问题是，各级党组织必须紧紧依靠30％的人，支持他们的一切创举，具体帮助40％的人解放思想，相信群众，学会本领，做好工作；对于20％持有怀疑态度的人，必须采取团结、斗争、团结的方法，推动他们前进；所余5％到10％的人，虽然数量不大，但影响不小，不容我们忽视。必须充分地发动群众，开展群众性的批评与自我批评，继续采用大放大鸣、大争大辩、大字报的方法，掀起一个共产主义思想解放运动，彻底烧掉三风五气，争取整风运动的全胜。当前，工农业生产上突出的问题，是措施赶不上指标的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们已在全省范围内展开了一个以比苦干、比措施、比进度、比实效为中心的群众性评比运动，通过相互检查，现场评比，抓两头、带中间的方法，把整风、生产两套锣鼓都打好。
    进行思想革命的武器必须从两方面去取得，一方面是理论，一方面是实践。而要使得理论与实践更好地紧密结合，还必须讲究工作方法和学习方法。那就是：在理论方面，要不断地学习马克思列宁主义，特别要认真钻研毛主席的著作。只有这样，才能使我们不断获得正确认识客观世界、改造客观世界的理论武器。过去我们在这方面作得很差，往往不自觉地走了很多弯路，回过头来再细细研究毛主席的指示，顿觉豁然开朗。在实践方面，主要是深入群众、依靠群众，坚决克服主观主义和官僚主义。
    我国是一个“一穷二白”的国家，在甘肃来说就更穷更白。这样：一方面改变社会面貌和改变自然面貌的任务特别艰巨，另一方面人民群众要求改变“穷”、“白”的状况也就更加迫切。只要我们不断地进行思想革命，继续发扬共产主义者的革命胆略，大胆设想，踏实苦干，放手发动群众，我们就能战胜一切困难，就能多快好省地建设一个社会主义的新甘肃。
