    Zhang Guangyi Teaches and Learns Simultaneously

    Peasant inventors and skilled agricultural tool reformers from all over the country not only impart their techniques without reservation, but also actively learn from others. Zhang Guangyi, a model agricultural laborer from Henan Province, is one of them. Now, he has drawn dozens of agricultural tool designs, both planar and three-dimensional.

    Zhang Guangyi's hometown, Lei Village Township in Dengfeng County, has basically achieved water conservancy. What is urgently needed now are water lifting tools. Therefore, he drew seventeen designs for water lifting tools at the exhibition. He also figured out a novel contraption called a clockwork waterwheel, which is designed based on the principle of a pendulum. Agricultural product processing tools are also something that his hometown needs to start reforming immediately, so creation in this area has become his second learning focus. Among the designs he drew are shredders, slicers, high-speed slicers, corn threshers, and wind-powered grinding mills.

    Since the opening of the agricultural tool exhibition, Zhang Guangyi has been patiently introducing the tools he created to the peasant brothers and sisters on site, and humbly listening to their suggestions for improvement. One day, a comrade from Anguo County, after measuring the dimensions of the three-ridge soil dividing ridger created by Zhang Guangyi, suggested that adding two grooved wooden wheels could compact the field ridges. Zhang Guangyi thought this suggestion was very good, so he immediately made improvements after returning home. (Gu Yeshi)

    张广义边传授边学习
    来自各地的农民发明家和改革农具的能手们不仅毫无保留地传授技术，而且积极主动地向别人学习。河南省农业劳动模范张广义就是其中的一个。现在，他已经绘出几十个农具图样，有平面的，也有立体的。
    张广义的家乡登封县雷村乡基本上实现了水利化，当前迫切需要的是提水工具。因此，他在展览会上绘了十七幅提水工具的图样，他还捉摸出了一种新鲜玩艺儿，叫做钟表式水车，是根据钟摆的原理设计的。农产品加工的工具也是他家乡需要立即着手改革的，这方面的创造也就成为他第二个学习重点。在他画的图样中有切丝切片机、花生脱壳机、跃速切片机、玉米脱粒机、风力碾等。
    农具展览会开幕以来，张广义经常在现场上耐心地向农民兄弟们介绍他创造的工具，并且虚心地听取别人提出的改进意见。有一天，安国县有一个同志把张广义创造的三垅分土式打畦机量完了尺寸后，提了个建议，再安上两个带槽的木轮就可以使田埂受到镇压。张广义认为这个意见很对，回去后就马上改进。　　　（顾也是）
