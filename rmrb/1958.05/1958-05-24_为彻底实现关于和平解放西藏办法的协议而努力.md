    Strive to Thoroughly Implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    Dalai Lama
    Today, May 23, 1958, is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" by representatives of the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government. As people from all walks of life in Tibet hold commemorative celebrations, I also commemorate and celebrate and make auspicious wishes. Since the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet seven years ago, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and with the direct assistance of the CPC Tibet Work Committee, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, and Han cadres, and the joint efforts of Tibetan cadres and people, not only have agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, medicine, transportation, and communications in Tibet gradually developed well, but also enterprises such as power plants have been built. In order to develop Tibetan culture, many schools have been widely established in various places, and cadres have been educated in politics and the domestic and international situation, improving their political and ideological levels. All these tasks, which conform to the actual situation in Tibet, have promoted the development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture. In the future, everyone should, like the upsurge of rectification in the interior, raise the achievements of the great leap in production. According to the spirit of building the country through diligence and frugality, improve work ability, implement various patriotic and progressive measures, study hard, improve the concept of unity, mutual trust between all nationalities, and on the basis of abandoning the idea of division and bias, thoroughly implement the seventeen-article agreement, and make unremitting efforts for the construction of a politically and religiously prosperous Tibet.

    为彻底实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议而努力
    达赖喇嘛
    今天，1958年5月23日，是中央人民政府和西藏地方政府双方的代表签订“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”七周年的节日，当此西藏地区各界人民举行纪念庆祝的时候，我也要纪念庆祝和进行吉祥的发愿。自从关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订后，七年以来，在中国共产党、伟大领袖毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，在中共西藏工委、进藏人民解放军和汉族干部的直接帮助下，西藏干部和人民的共同努力下，不但西藏地方的农业、牧业、林业、医药、运输交通等，都日益有了良好的发展，还进行了发电厂等企业建设，为发展西藏藏族文化而广泛在各地设立许多学校，对干部进行了政治和国内外局势方面的学习，提高了政治思想水平，所有这些符合于西藏地区实际情况的工作，使西藏的政治、经济、文化等方面，都获得了发展。今后大家更应该像内地掀起整风高潮以提高生产跃进的成绩一样，根据勤俭建国的精神，提高工作能力，实现爱国进步的各种措施，努力学习，提高各民族团结互相信任的思想，在抛弃分裂和有偏向的思想基础上，彻底实现协议十七条，为政教两全幸福繁荣的西藏建设进行不懈的努力。
