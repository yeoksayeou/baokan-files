Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Encouraged by the general line of socialist construction, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are bursting with enthusiasm and are determined to improve their military technology and combat skills to safeguard the country's safe implementation of the general line of socialist construction.

The officers and soldiers of the 4th Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit on the Fujian front, who are currently on combat duty, cheered and said after hearing the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the general line of socialist construction formulated by the meeting, "This is a great event. We must resolutely implement the spirit of the general line and make a great leap forward in training and combat to destroy all enemy planes that dare to invade and protect the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production." Yang Guozhen, the company commander of the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company, who had won four battles and shot down or damaged five enemy planes since the spring of this year, was even more excited. He put forward a "red and expert" plan for a great march towards military science and technology and launched a revolutionary competition with the company commanders of two brother companies. On the 27th, the Qingdao Naval Unit convened some combat heroes, meritorious servants, models, advanced workers, and technical experts from various ships, companies, organs, and hospitals to discuss the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In the discussion, people unanimously believed that the Party's general line of socialist construction is also the guideline for various aspects of military construction. In order to respond to the Party's call for a technical revolution, the deputy regimental commander of a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment put forward a guarantee at the meeting that "medium repairs of artillery will not leave the regiment, and minor repairs will not leave the company." He said: "Technology is not mysterious. What others can do, we can definitely do too." A certain tank regiment not only completed five technical innovations during the meeting but also completed two technical creations in succession since the meeting closed. According to the Party Central Committee's call for technical and cultural revolutions, the leading organs of the engineering corps also decided to immediately launch a vigorous technical innovation movement in the construction units.

The officers and soldiers participating in the construction of the motherland have even greater enthusiasm. On the day of the closing of the meeting, the officers and soldiers of a certain railway engineering unit, who were busy laying rails on the Sandaokan-Sanshenggong section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, created a new record of 6.15 kilometers of manual rail laying per day on the Baotou-Lanzhou line. The 5th Company of a certain unit adopted the method of rapid beam dropping, and in eight hours and thirty-one minutes, erected seven 12-meter-long reinforced concrete T-beams, creating the latest record for railway engineering bridge construction. Inspired by the general line of construction, the officers and soldiers working on the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site have been sending letters of determination to the construction site headquarters day after day, striving to complete the reservoir project in a faster, better, and more economical way. The staff and workers of an automobile repair plant of a certain unit on the Fujian front are determined to cooperate with local factories to strive to complete and exceed the task of manufacturing 1,000 tractors this year while ensuring the completion of national defense repair and assembly tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army has decided to immediately launch extensive publicity and study activities on the Party's general line of socialist construction throughout the army.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, arranged the dissemination, publicity, and study of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China at a meeting of heads of propaganda departments of units stationed in Beijing on the 27th. He emphasized that the general line of socialist construction is a brilliant example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution and is the fundamental guarantee for accelerating China's socialist construction at high speed. It is necessary to conscientiously organize dissemination, publicity, and study.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian said that a vigorous campaign to publicize the general line should be launched immediately throughout the army, mobilizing responsible cadres at all levels, and organizing a large number of report teams to make reports to cadres and soldiers; at the same time, all publicity tools and various forms, such as newspapers and periodicals, cultural troupes, film projection teams, slideshows, radio broadcasts, reading newspapers, big-character posters, wall newspapers, small-scale discussions, etc., should be used to publicize the content of the general line, the correctness and great significance of the general line, and the conditions and guarantees for realizing the general line in a popular way, so that everyone knows the general line and it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and combined with the actual work and ideological situation of each unit, it will become a material force to further boost morale and promote a great leap forward in the army's combat readiness training, work, and ideology, pushing the army's comprehensive leap forward centered on combat readiness training to a new climax.

In recent days, the leading organs of the Guangzhou and Nanjing Military Regions have also launched activities to publicize and study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in their affiliated units. The Party Committee of the Guangzhou Military Region stipulated that a publicity month for the general line of socialist construction will be carried out in the affiliated units from the end of May to the beginning of July to further improve the understanding of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, unify their thinking, inspire their enthusiasm and dedication, and push the leap forward to a new climax.
