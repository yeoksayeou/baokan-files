　　For Peace, Democracy, and Independence!
　　——International Labor Day in Japan
    On May 1, 1958, Japan held the 29th "May Day" celebration rallies and demonstrations in 580 locations nationwide, starting from Tokyo and Osaka, and centered on major cities. More than five million working people, including workers, farmers, students, and housewives, participated in the "May Day" celebration rallies. The number of people participating in the rally this year increased by approximately 800,000 compared to last year, setting a historical record for "May Day" activities in Japan.

    At venues across the country, in addition to economic demands such as raising wages and social welfare, many banners and flags also carried slogans such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet, immediately and unconditionally ban nuclear weapons," "Oppose the import of nuclear weapons," and "Resolutely oppose the war policy pursued by the US-Japan reactionary group."

    On this day, more than 600,000 working people participated in the central celebration rally for "May Day" held at Meiji Jingu Gaien in Tokyo (see above picture). The venue was filled with tens of thousands of red flags, complementing the fresh green of the oak, beech, and maple trees. This year's "May Day" celebration was attended by workers and unions with various political and ideological tendencies. Their representatives sat together on the rostrum. This marks the increased determination of Japanese workers in their struggle for unified action.

    At 10:00 AM, the conference was declared open. After speeches by representatives of political parties and social organizations such as the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, the conference adopted the "May Day" resolution to "unite all forces to strive for the realization of workers' political demands and the development of progressive forces." From 11:00 AM, the rally participants divided into five routes and conducted demonstrations in Tokyo for several hours.

    The day of the "May Day" celebration coincided with the first day of the election campaign after the dissolution of the Japanese House of Representatives. Candidates from the Communist Party and the Socialist Party who had registered to participate in the election also participated in the rally and demonstration, delivering their first campaign speeches to the workers.

    First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, said in his speech at the rally: "The world has now entered an era of transition from capitalism to socialism. Peaceful coexistence has become a huge trend. However, the Kishi Cabinet of the Liberal Democratic Party, in defiance of the global trend, is pursuing a traitorous policy of following the United States in expanding its arms race and war preparations, and as a result, its domestic and foreign policies have reached a dead end. Due to the increasing opposition of workers and the people across the country to the government, the government finally had to dissolve the House of Representatives. Currently, the Japanese government is creating various incidents to attack the Japanese Communist Party, while also targeting various labor unions. This is a provocation by US-Japan monopoly capital against all of our progressive and democratic forces, and it is also a blatant means of undermining the participation of democratic forces in the election. However, this does not mean that they are strong, but rather that they are weak. We should strive to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party in this election, so that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party can win a majority of votes, overthrow the Liberal Democratic Party government that creates corruption, poverty, and violence, and lay the foundation for the establishment of a democratic government aimed at peace, independence, democracy, and improving people's lives." The Chairman of the Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, also called on the masses in his speech: "Fight to overthrow the Kishi Cabinet and develop progressive forces."

    The slogans put forward by various labor unions, such as "Down with the Kishi Cabinet," "Establish a democratic government," and "Let the representatives of workers enter the Diet," demonstrated their determination to fight for the election. Labor unions such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union and the All-Japan Transport Workers' Union coincidentally made large models of the National Diet Building and carried them to the venue.

    The slogans and models held by the workers vividly reflected their hatred for the Kishi Cabinet's war policy and the United States' atomic arms buildup policy. These slogans read: "Demand that the United States and Britain follow the Soviet Union in immediately ceasing nuclear weapons testing," "Support the convening of a summit meeting," and some read: "Oppose the establishment of missile bases in Japan" and "Oppose the import of nuclear weapons into Japan." Most of the slogans exposed the Kishi Cabinet's policy of following the United States in implementing arms expansion and war preparation.

    Missile models were carried into the venue one after another, reminding people to be vigilant and oppose war. The most noteworthy of these was the one made by the Tokyo Metropolitan Transportation workers. This model depicted a worker, the same size as a real person, throwing Nobusuke Kishi, missiles, and bombs into a trash can. A young worker, while rotating the model, said happily: "This was conceived by everyone together, and because it was made during breaks from work, it took more than a week. In this election, we must throw the reactionaries into the trash can like this!"

    Among the economic demands put forward by the workers, there were also many slogans reflecting the current characteristics. Many banners read "Demand the establishment of a minimum wage system"; and many other banners read slogans such as demanding higher wages, opposing unemployment, opposing factory closures, and demanding shorter working hours. In the face of the capitalist economic crisis caused by the capitalist economy, these demands of the working class also have a more urgent nature. These banners that appeared at the "May Day" rally vividly foreshadowed that the struggle of the Japanese working class this year will be even more intense.

    Before "May Day" and in the face of the general election, the Kishi Nobusuke government also intensified its suppression of the labor movement. The Kishi Nobusuke government fabricated a series of fabricated incidents by means of framing and slander, such as saying "spying on state secrets" and "organizing a secret fleet for entering and leaving the country," etc., attempting to portray the Japanese Communist Party as a conspiratorial group that undermines the country, spreading an atmosphere of distrust in the Japanese Communist Party among the Japanese people, and using this as an excuse to arrest many cadres of the Japanese Communist Party, including members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. At the same time, before "May Day," the Kishi Nobusuke government also carried out a large number of "dispositions" against members of public corporations and government offices and labor union organizations such as the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union, the National Electrical Communication Workers' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, and the National Judicial Civil Servants' Union who participated in the spring struggle. More than 100,000 workers have been subjected to administrative sanctions such as suspension, salary reduction, warning, and reprimand, and more than 20 union cadres have also been dismissed. In addition, the Kishi Nobusuke government also tried its best to persecute teachers and staff who opposed the revival of militaristic education. Before "May Day," the Japanese government authorities searched 77 organizations belonging to teachers and staff unions in Tokyo, and spread the word that they would arrest activists from teachers and staff unions in the near future. Faced with this suppression, this year's "May Day" also more strongly demonstrated the combativeness of the working class. Workers from the government office labor union system held high banners with "Oppose sanctions," and workers from other labor unions also held many banners with slogans such as "Defend the right to union activities" and "Oppose suppression." The workers of the Central Post Office Branch of the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union, who had carried out the most intense struggle under government suppression, carried a red flag in front of their demonstration procession with the names of the dismissed union cadres written on it, expressing their determination to fight against suppression. On April 30, on the eve of "May Day," organizations across the country belonging to the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union and the National Electrical Communication Workers' Union held rallies in their workplaces at the same time to protest the government's suppression; on May 2, the National Tax Workers' Union also held the same protest struggle.

    The offensive launched by the Kishi Nobusuke government against the Japanese working class before and after "May Day" will inevitably be strengthened with the development of the election struggle. However, the great strength shown by the Japanese working class in celebrating "May Day" also shows that as long as they unite and fight, they have the potential to defeat the reactionary forces and lead Japan onto a path of peace, democracy, independence, and prosperity.

### 要和平，要民主，要独立！——“五一”国际劳动节在日本

　　要和平，要民主，要独立！
　　——“五一”国际劳动节在日本
    1958年5月1日，日本全国从东京、大阪开始，以各主要城市为中心，在五百八十处举行了第二十九次“五一”节庆祝大会和示威游行活动。包括工人、农民、学生、家庭主妇在内的五百多万劳动人民，参加了“五一”节庆祝大会。今年参加大会的人数比去年大约增加八十万人以上，创日本纪念“五一”节活动的历史上的最高纪录。
    在全国各地的会场上，除了提出提高工资及社会福利等经济要求外，还有不少标语牌、旗帜上写着“打倒岸内阁、立即无条件地禁止核武器”、“反对运进核武器”以及“坚决反对美日反动集团所奉行的战争政策”等口号。
    这一天，有六十万以上的劳动群众参加了在东京明治神宫外苑举行的庆祝“五一”节的中央庆祝大会（见上图）。会场上布满了数万面红旗，同一片新绿的樫树、榉树和枫树交相辉映。今年参加“五一”节庆祝大会的有具有各种政治、思想倾向的工人和工会。他们的代表一同坐在主席台上。这标志着日本工人为统一行动而进行的斗争更加坚定了。
    上午十时，大会宣布开会。在社会党、共产党、全日本农民协会联合会等政党和社会团体的代表致词后，大会通过了“团结一切力量为实现工人的政治要求和发展革新势力而奋斗”的“五一”决议。从上午十一时起，大会队伍分五路在东京都内进行了数小时的示威游行。
    庆祝“五一”的当天，正是日本众议院解散之后开始进入选举活动的第一天。已经报名参加竞选的共产党、社会党的候选人，也参加了大会和示威游行，向工人们发表了第一次竞选演说。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三在大会上的讲话中说：“现在世界已经进入了由资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代。和平共处成了巨大的潮流。但是，自由民主党的岸内阁违背世界大势，奉行追随美国扩军备战的卖国政策，结果它的国内外政策都已陷于穷途末路。由于工人和全国人民反对政府的情绪日益加强，政府终于不得不解散众议院。目前，日本政府正在制造各种事件攻击日本共产党，同时还把攻击的矛头指向各个工会。这是美日垄断资本对我们全体革新势力和民主力量的挑衅，也是露骨的破坏民主力量参加竞选的手段。但是，这决不说明它们强大，相反地却是它们脆弱的表现。我们应该努力在这次选举中击败自由民主党，使社会党和共产党获得多数选票，打倒制造贪污、贫困和暴力的自由民主党政府，为建立一个以和平、独立、民主和提高人民生活为目标的民主政府打下基础。”社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在讲话中也号召群众：“为打倒岸内阁和发展革新势力而奋斗”。
    各个工会提出的“打倒岸内阁”、“建立民主政府”、“让劳动者的代表进入国会”等口号，表明了为选举而斗争的决心。东京都职员工会和全日本交通运输工会等工会组织不约而同地都作了国会议事堂的大模型，把它们抬到会场来了。
    工人们举着的标语牌和抬着的模型，鲜明地反映了对于岸内阁的战争政策和美国的原子备战政策的憎恶。这些标语牌上写着：“要求美英两国效仿苏联立即停止试验核武器”“拥护召开最高级会议”等口号，有的写道：“反对在日本建立导弹基地”“反对把核武器运进日本”。大部分标语口号都是揭露岸内阁追随美国实行扩军备战政策的。
    导弹模型一个一个地抬进会场来，向人们提醒应该提高警惕，反对战争。其中最引人注意的是东京都交通工人们制造的一个。这个模型塑造了一个同真人一般大小的工人，他正在把岸信介和导弹、炸弹一起扔到垃圾箱里去。一位年轻的工人一面转动着模型，一面愉快地说：“这是大家共同想出来的，因为是利用工作空隙作的，所以花了一个多星期的时间。这次大选，我们一定要像这样把反动派扔到垃圾箱里去！”
    在工人们提出的经济要求中，也包括了不少反映当前特点的口号。有很多标语牌上写着“要求建立最低工资制度”；还有不少标语牌写着要求提高工资、反对失业、反对关闭工厂、要求缩短劳动时间等口号。在资本主义经济引起的资本主义世界经济危机面前，工人阶级的这些要求也带有更加迫切的性质。出现在“五一”节大会会场上的这些标语牌，鲜明地预示着今年日本工人阶级的斗争，将有更加剧烈的开展。
    在“五一”节之前和面临大选的情况下，岸信介政府对工人运动的镇压也加剧了。岸信介政府以栽赃诬陷的手段，?造了一系列莫须有的事件，如说“刺探了国家机密”“组织了秘密出入国境的舰队”等等，企图把日本共产党说成是个破坏国家的阴谋集团，在日本人民中间散布不信任日本共产党的气氛，并且以此为借口，逮捕了许多日本共产党的干部，其中还包括了日共的中央委员。同时，在“五一”节之前，岸信介政府还对参加了春季斗争的全递信从业员工会、全国电气通信工会、国营铁道工会、全国司法职员工会等公共企业和官公厅工会组织的会员，进行了大批“处分”。受到停职、减薪、警告、训斥等行政处分的工人已达十万名以上，有二十名以上的工会干部还遭到了解雇。此外，对于反对复活军国主义教育的教职员，岸信介政府也极力加以迫害，“五一”节前，日本政府当局在东京曾搜查了七十七处教职员工会所属的组织，并且放出风声说，最近还要逮捕教职员工会的积极分子。面对着这种镇压，今年的“五一”节也更强烈地显示了工人阶级的战斗性。官公厅工会系统的工人手里高举着“反对处分”的标语牌，其他工会的工人们也举着很多写有“保卫工会活动权利”“反对镇压”等口号的标语牌。曾经在政府镇压下进行过最激烈斗争的全递信从业员工会中央邮局支部的工人们，在自己的示威游行队伍前面，打起一面红旗，上面写着被解雇的工会干部的名字，表示了他们反对镇压的战斗决心。“五一”前夕，在4月30日，全递信从业员工会和全国电气通信工会所属的全国各地组织，同时在工作场所举行集会，抗议政府的镇压；5月2日，全国税务工会也举行了同样的抗议斗争。
    岸信介政府在“五一”前后对日本工人阶级所展开的进攻，随着选举斗争的开展，必然还会加强。但是日本工人阶级在庆祝“五一”活动中所显示的巨大力量，也说明了只要团结一致地进行斗争，他们是有可能击败反动势力，把日本引上一条和平、民主、独立、繁荣的道路的。
