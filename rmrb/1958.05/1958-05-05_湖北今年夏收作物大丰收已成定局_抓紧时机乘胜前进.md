    Hubei's Summer Harvest is Set for a Bumper Year: Seize the Opportunity and Advance Victoriously

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its expanded meeting of the Standing Committee held from April 26th to 28th, decided to mobilize the people of the province to further boost their efforts, find solutions, seize the opportunity, and advance victoriously.

    The meeting pointed out that, according to the Provincial Committee's recent inspection of agricultural production across various regions, Hubei Province's summer harvest is definitively headed for a bumper year. Many areas are experiencing a more than twofold increase in summer harvest crops compared to last year, with some counties seeing a summer harvest yield exceeding their total grain output for the entire previous year. The Xiangyang region estimates its summer harvest crop yield to reach around 3 billion jin, a more than twofold increase compared to last year's summer harvest. Rapeseed crops are generally growing well across the region. Songzi County's 70,000 mu of rapeseed are expected to yield an average of over 200 jin per mu, with 30,000 mu of "Victory Rapeseed" reaching 270 jin per mu, and some areas exceeding 600 jin per mu. This marks the first significant victory in this year's Great Leap Forward in production. Furthermore, spring planting conditions are generally better than in the past, characterized by well-prepared fields, deep plowing, dense planting of rice, and timely transplanting of cotton. Base fertilizer application for rice and cotton has generally exceeded 200 dan per mu, a one- to twofold increase compared to the past.

    The meeting also pointed out that, based on recent inspections, it is necessary to prevent complacency and relaxation among some individuals in the face of victory. For example, some agricultural cooperatives, having increased their wheat yield twofold compared to last year, are reluctant to humbly learn from advanced regions. Additionally, some counties, having completed their annual production increase plan and more than half of their annual grain production plan with just the summer harvest, have failed to promptly propose new goals to the masses based on the new circumstances.

    The meeting believes that Party leaders at all levels must fully recognize the immense significance of these victories already achieved in the Great Leap Forward in production, prevent complacency, and, based on the new situation, promptly and realistically propose new goals to inspire the people to continue the Great Leap Forward. The Provincial Committee believes that the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has demonstrated a spirit of revolutionary momentum in addressing this issue. This region originally planned for a total grain production of 6 billion jin for the entire year, a 50% increase compared to 1957. At the time, this was considered a plan for a Great Leap Forward. However, the region is expected to harvest around 3 billion jin in the summer harvest alone, accounting for one-half of the planned total annual grain production. The ratio of summer to autumn grain in this region is generally one to two, meaning that if the summer harvest reaches 3 billion jin, the autumn harvest should yield at least 6 billion jin. Based on this new situation, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently proposed a new goal to cadres and people across the region: to further increase annual grain production by 2 billion jin, bringing the region's total annual output to 8 billion jin. This call was immediately met with enthusiastic response from the vast majority of cadres and people in the region. Upon hearing this call, the Sui County Committee and district and township Party committees held meetings overnight, further breaking down conservative thinking through detailed calculations and proposing the slogan of striving to be the top county in the province in terms of total grain production. The county originally planned for a total annual grain production of 1.3 billion jin, an increase of over 60% compared to last year; the current goal is to reach 1.6 to 1.8 billion jin in total annual grain production, doubling last year's output.

    The meeting believes that, to ensure continuous leaps forward in agricultural production this year, leaders at all levels must highly concentrate and concretely focus on the current production, grasping each link tightly. The important links in current production are taking all measures to ensure the successful completion of the summer harvest; timely sowing of cotton and oil crops; and dense planting of rice. The second key link in annual production is strengthening field management and harvesting of autumn crops. The third is seizing the opportunity to sow late-autumn crops. Disaster prevention and drought resistance should be implemented throughout the year.

    The meeting believes that to strive for increased yields in next year's summer harvest crops, preparatory work should begin now, including summarizing and evaluating the experiences of high-yield summer harvest crops, and doing a good job in seed selection and preservation. To this end, the Provincial Committee will convene an on-site meeting in Gucheng County, Xiangyang Region, in early May, to summarize the experiences of high-yield summer harvest crops, arrange winter planting, and lay the foundation for striving for even greater yields in next year's summer harvest crops.

    湖北今年夏收作物大丰收已成定局
    抓紧时机乘胜前进
    本报讯　中共湖北省委在4月26日至28日召开的常委扩大会议上，决定动员全省人民进一步鼓干劲，想办法，抓紧时机，乘胜前进。
    会议指出，根据省委最近对各地农业生产检查的情况表明：湖北省今年夏收作物大丰收已成定局。很多地区今年的夏收作物比去年增产一倍多，有些县夏收这一季的产量就比去年全年粮食产量还多。据襄阳专区预计，今年夏收作物产量可达三十亿斤左右，比去年夏收作物产量增产一倍多。各地油菜普遍生长良好。松滋县七万亩油菜平均每亩可产二百斤以上，其中三万亩胜利油菜每亩可达二百七十斤，最高的每亩可产六百斤以上。这是今年生产大跃进中的第一个巨大胜利。同时，今年春耕播种情况普遍比过去好，其特点是大部耕田整得好，而且进行了深耕和水稻密植，棉花插秧适时，一般水稻棉花所施底肥都在二百担以上，比过去增加了一、二倍。
    会议同时指出，根据最近检查的情况来看，应当防止某些人在胜利面前产生满足和松懈的情绪。如有的农业社今年小麦增产比去年提高了二倍，因此不愿虚心到先进地区去学习先进经验。另外，有的县夏收一季就完成了全年的增产计划，完成了今年全年粮食计划产量的一半多，但并没有根据新的情况及时向群众提出新的奋斗目标。
    会议认为：党的各级领导必须充分认识在生产大跃进中已经取得的这些胜利的巨大意义，防止自满松劲思想，在胜利的基础上，根据新的情况，及时地、实事求是地提出新的奋斗目标，鼓舞人民继续大跃进。省委认为，中共襄阳地委在解决这个问题上表现了势如破竹的革命精神。这个地区原来规划今年全年粮食生产总产量是六十亿斤，比1957年增产50％。在当时看来，这是一个大跃进的计划。但是这个专区仅夏收一季即可收粮三十亿斤左右，占全年计划粮食总产量二分之一。而这个地区的夏粮和秋粮的比例，一般是一与二之比，即夏粮如果收三十亿斤，秋粮最少收六十亿斤。根据这一新的情况，最近中共襄阳地委向全区干部和人民提出全年粮食再增产二十亿斤的奋斗目标，即使全区全年产量达到八十亿斤。这个号召提出后，立即得到全区广大干部和群众的热烈响应。随县在听到这个号召后，县委和区乡党委都连夜开会，用算细账的方法，进一步打破了保守思想，提出了争取以县为单位占全省粮食总产量的第一位的口号。这个县原来计划全年粮食总产量为十三亿斤，比去年增产60％以上；现在提出的奋斗目标是全年粮食总产量要达到十六亿至十八亿斤，比去年翻一翻。
    会议认为，为了保证今年农业生产能够不断跃进，各级领导必须十分集中和十分具体地抓住目前的生产，而且要一环扣一环地抓紧。目前生产的重要环节是采取一切措施保证胜利完成夏收；棉花、油料作物及时播种和水稻密植。全年生产的第二环是加强秋收作物的田间管理和收获。第三要抓住播种晚秋作物。至于防灾防旱要贯彻全年。
    会议认为，要争取明年夏收作物增产，现在就应开始作准备工作，总结评比夏收作物的丰产经验，搞好选种、留种工作等。为此，省委将于5月上旬在襄阳专区谷城县召开现场会议，总结夏收作物丰产经验，布置冬播，为争取明年夏收作物更大丰收打下基础。（海波）
