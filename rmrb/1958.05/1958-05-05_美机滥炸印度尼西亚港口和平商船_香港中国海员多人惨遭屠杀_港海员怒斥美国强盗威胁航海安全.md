Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 4th. The incident of American planes assisting Indonesian rebels in bombing Hong Kong merchant ships docked in Indonesian ports and massacring Hong Kong Chinese seamen has aroused great indignation among Hong Kong seamen and the families of the deceased.

According to Hong Kong newspapers on the 3rd, the "Flying Goose," belonging to Hong Kong's Chee Hwa Company, was bombed by an aircraft of "unidentified nationality" while docked in Ambon, Indonesia, on April 28th. Of the 26 Hong Kong Chinese seamen on board, nine have been confirmed dead, and six are missing. In recent days, several merchant ships have been bombed by aircraft of "unidentified nationality" in Indonesian waters. Survivors of these bombed ships have confirmed that the attacking aircraft were American "Mitchell" bombers.

On the 3rd, the person in charge of the Hong Kong Seamen's Union told Xinhua News Agency that the American planes' assistance to Indonesian rebels in bombing peaceful merchant ships and massacring Hong Kong Chinese seamen was an extremely brutal act that seriously threatened the safety of Hong Kong seamen traveling on Indonesian routes. The deaths of nine Hong Kong seamen have aroused great anger among Hong Kong seamen.

Many seamen on the 3rd condemned the atrocities that occurred in Indonesian waters. A worker with thirty years of sailing experience said that the American planes' indiscriminate bombing of merchant ships engaged in peaceful transportation was a serious violation of international law and posed a serious threat to the safety of our seamen's lives.

The families of the deceased seamen have been very saddened and angered since receiving the news on the afternoon of the 2nd. A family member of a deceased seaman said that this was completely a despicable murder of seamen by international robbers.

    港海员怒斥美国强盗威胁航海安全
    新华社香港4日电　美国飞机协助印度尼西亚叛乱分子，轰炸停泊在印度尼西亚港口的香港商船，屠杀香港中国海员工人的事件，在香港海员和死难海员家属中激起了极大愤慨。
    据香港报纸3日报道，香港捷和公司所属的“飞雁轮”，4月28日停泊在印度尼西亚安波港时，遭到一架“国籍不明”的飞机的轰炸，全船二十六个香港中国海员工人中，已证实有九人被炸死，六人失踪。最近几天，已经有好几艘商船在印度尼西亚海面受到“国籍不明”的飞机的轰炸，据这些被炸商船的生还者证实，这些行凶的飞机是美国“密契尔”式轰炸机。
    香港海员工会负责人3日对新华社记者发表谈话说，美国飞机协助印度尼西亚叛乱分子轰炸和平商船，屠杀香港中国海员工人，是一件非常残暴的行为，严重地威胁着行走印度尼西亚航线的香港海员的安全，九个香港海员的死难事件，已经引起香港海员工人的极大愤怒。
    许多海员工人3日都对这次在印度尼西亚海面发生的暴行提出谴责。一个经历了三十年航海生活的工人说，美国飞机对从事和平运输的商船滥肆轰炸，严重违反了国际法，对我们海员工人的生命安全构成严重威胁。
    死难海员家属从2日下午接到消息后就非常悲痛和愤怒，一个死难海员的家属说，这完全是国际强盗对海员的卑鄙的谋杀。
