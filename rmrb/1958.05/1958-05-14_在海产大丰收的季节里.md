　　Unprecedented Yields in the South China Sea Fishing Grounds
　　This newspaper reports that hundreds of fishing fleets scattered across the South China Sea fishing grounds have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics from relevant departments in more than thirty major fishing ports along the coast of Guangdong Province, such as Nan'ao, Jiazi, and Beihai, the total fish catch this spring has reached more than 2.07 million dan (1 dan = 50 kg), an increase of more than 370,000 dan compared to the same period last year, breaking the historical record for the same period.
　　This spring, the climate in the South China Sea was warm, and the water temperature was high, which was suitable for early spawning. The fish season came earlier than in previous years. Many fishing cooperatives in ports such as Qinglan and Bu'ao set sail more than a month earlier. A batch of fishing boats that recently returned to port averaged more than 30,000 fish caught per boat in two days, several times more than in previous years.
　　Yellow Croaker Schools "Croaking"
　　This newspaper reports that the annual small yellow croaker season has arrived. At the docks along the Huangpu River in Shanghai, aquatic product company fishing vessels are returning fully loaded every day. After unloading the fresh fish from the hold, the fishing workers load up with refrigerated ice, food, and vegetables, and rush back to the fishing grounds.
　　During the spring fishing season, upon entering the fishing grounds, people can faintly hear the "croaking" sounds, which are the yellow croakers calling during the spawning period. The fishermen cast their nets and slowly drag them forward, catching tens of thousands of kilograms in one haul.
　　This newspaper reports that the spring fishing season has arrived on the coast of Fujian. Along with the "croaking" calls of the yellow croaker schools, sharks and krill have also begun to appear. Over one hundred thousand fishermen in the province have set sail to hunt down the fish schools day and night. Although the various fishing grounds here are often harassed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Matsu, Kinmen, and Taiwan islands, the resourceful and brave fishermen, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces, are persisting in maritime production and have generally achieved bumper harvests. Fishermen in the northeast Fujian fishing grounds caught more than 14.4 million kilograms of fish and shrimp in a month and a half, an increase of 45% compared to the same period last year.
　　Shrimp Schools Appear in Dagu Estuary Fishing Grounds
　　This newspaper reports that the first batch of prawn schools this year has entered the Dagu Estuary fishing grounds in the Bohai Bay. The fishing cooperatives in Tanggu District have caught more than 450,000 kilograms in ten days. Currently, in the Dagu Estuary fishing grounds, which are 120 kilometers long and about 30 kilometers wide, thousands of sails are gathered, and tens of thousands of nets are cast, with over four thousand fishing households working day and night to welcome the first peak season of the year. This year's shrimp season came a week earlier than in previous years, and the area is extensive. On the third day after the discovery of the prawns, the shrimp schools appeared successively on the sea surface for a length of about 100 kilometers.
　　Southward-Moving Kelp Begins Harvest
　　This newspaper reports that the four hundred platforms (five platforms per mu/667 m2) of kelp cultivated by the Fujian Provincial Aquatic Products Department in Lianjiang, Xiapu, Pingtan, and Xiamen, etc. at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, are growing well. Currently, the kelp seedlings in various places have grown to more than 1.5 to 2 meters in length. The Xiamen kelp farm, where the season is earlier, has already begun harvesting. It is estimated that the province can produce about 200,000 kilograms of fresh kelp this year. The kelp trial-cultivated in Shengsi, Shenjiamen, Ninghai, Yuhuan, Nanjishan and other places along the coast of Zhejiang are currently being harvested, with an estimated yield of about 3,000 kilograms of fresh kelp per mu.
　　Nutritious kelp was originally only produced in Qingdao and Dalian in our country. Last year, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces moved a batch of seedlings for trial cultivation along the coast, and the results were good, thus breaking the saying that "kelp production cannot cross the Yangtze River."
　　Hunting Great Sharks
　　This newspaper reports that fishermen in the southeast coastal areas of Zhejiang Province have caught more than 150 sharks. The sharks generally weigh five to six thousand kilograms, with the largest reaching 20,000 kilograms.
　　This year, the great sharks have appeared early and abundantly. Thousands upon thousands of great shark schools are migrating in the fishing grounds. The fishermen are currently driving thousands of fishing boats to continue hunting on the ocean surface. This year, the fishing boats are equipped with several sets of shark hooks, and some have even brought shark harpoon guns. Some Zhoushan fishermen who have never caught great sharks before have also brought shark hooks to chase them in the Dongtou waters this year.

　　在海产大丰收的季节里
　　南海渔场产量空前
    本报讯　遍布在南海渔场上的几百个捕鱼船队，获得了历年来未有的大丰收。据广东省沿海的南澳、甲子、北海等三十多个主要渔港有关部门的统计，今年春季捕鱼总量已达两百零七万多担，比去年同期增加三十七万担以上，突破历史上同期捕鱼量的最高纪录。
    今年南海春汛气候温暖、水温高、适于早产卵，鱼汛比往年来得早。清澜、卜鳌等港许多渔业社，都提早一个多月出海。不久以前回港的一批渔船，平均每船在两天内就捕鱼三万多条，比往年多几倍。
    黄鱼群呱呱叫
    本报讯　海洋上一年一度的小黄鱼汛又到来了。上海黄浦江边的码头上，现在每天都有水产公司的渔轮满载归来。捕鱼工人们卸完船舱里的鲜鱼，装上冷藏冰，带了粮食和蔬菜，又匆匆驾船奔向渔场。
    在春季鱼汛里，人们一进入渔场，就隐约传来阵阵的“呱呱”声，这是产卵期中的黄鱼在叫，渔工们撒下网，缓缓地拖着前行，一网就能捕到上万斤。
    本报讯　春季鱼汛已经来到福建沿海，随着黄鱼鱼群“呱呱”声的叫唤，沙鱼、毛虾等也开始出现。全省上十万渔民都已扬帆出海，日夜围捕鱼群。这里各个渔场，虽然经常遭受盘踞马祖、金门和台湾岛上的蒋军的袭扰，但机智勇敢的渔民们，在人民解放军海防部队保护下，坚持海上生产，普遍获得了丰收。闽东北渔场渔民们在一个半月中共捕到鱼虾一千四百多万斤，比去年同期增产45％。
    大沽口渔场出现虾群
    本报讯　今年的首批对虾群已进入渤海湾的大沽口渔场，塘沽区的渔业社，十天内已捕获四十五万多斤。目前，在长达一百二十公里、宽约三十公里的大沽口渔场，千帆云集，万网齐张，四千多户渔民正夜以继日地迎接今年第一个捕捞旺季。今年的虾汛比往年早来了一星期，同时面积广，发现对虾的第三天，虾群就在长约一百公里的海面上相继出现。
    南移的海带开始收割
    本报讯　去年年底和今年1月初，福建省水产部门在连江、霞浦、平潭和厦门等地养殖的四百台（五台合一亩）海带，生长良好。目前各地海带苗已长达一点五公尺到两公尺以上，季节较早的厦门海带养殖场已经开始收获。预计今年全省可以产鲜海带二十万斤左右。在浙江沿海嵊泗、沈家门、宁海、玉环、南麂等地试养的海带，目前正在收割，每亩估计可产鲜海带三千斤左右。
    富有营养的海带，我国原来只有青岛、大连一带出产，去年，福建浙江两省移去一批幼苗，在沿海试验养殖，结果生长良好，从而打破了“海带生产不能过长江”的说法。
　　追捕大鲨鱼
    本报讯　浙江省东南沿海渔民已捕鲨鱼一百五十多条。鲨鱼体重一般都在五、六千斤，最大的达两万斤。
    今年大鲨鱼发得早，发得旺。成千上万条大鲨鱼群在渔场洄游。渔民们目前正驾驶着几千只渔船在洋面上继续追捕。今年渔船上都备了好几套鲨鱼钩，有的还带了鲨鱼镖枪。有些从来没有捕过大鲨鱼的舟山渔民，今年也带了鲨鱼钩在洞头洋面追捕。
