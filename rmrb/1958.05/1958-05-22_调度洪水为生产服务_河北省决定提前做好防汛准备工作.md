Scheduling Floods to Serve Production
Hebei Province Decides to Make Early Preparations for Flood Prevention

This Newspaper Reports: The Hebei Provincial Flood Prevention Work Conference, which closed on the 19th, put forward a new task for the people of the province: to prevent any complacency and make early preparations for flood prevention to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.

Since last winter, Hebei Province's water conservancy construction has greatly developed, and some of the masses and cadres have developed a sense of complacency, believing that so many water conservancy projects have been built that there will be no problems even if floods occur. Therefore, the conference required all localities to carry out a major debate among the masses and cadres centered on the implementation of this year's flood prevention tasks and requirements, so that people can recognize the natural law of spring drought and autumn floods in Hebei Province, raise vigilance, summon up their energy, strengthen preparations, and ensure the complete victory of the flood prevention struggle.

The conference pointed out that in flood prevention work, it is necessary to further promote the communist spirit of cooperation that has emerged since the water conservancy construction last winter. In the event of particularly large floods, all localities must break down county and township boundaries in accordance with the spirit of considering both upstream and downstream areas, combining surface and linear areas, and unified arrangements, and jointly support areas with difficulties. The contradictions between drainage and water use during the flood season should also be reasonably resolved in the spirit of communist cooperation.

The conference decided that this year's flood prevention work in Hebei Province should undergo a strategic shift, from the past passive defense of points and lines to a comprehensive and active offense, scheduling floods to serve production. The conference conducted detailed research and deployment on this, and required flood prevention command organizations above the county level in all localities to be established and put into action by June 1st, and to complete a major inspection of flood prevention preparations before June 10th.

    调度洪水为生产服务
    河北省决定提前做好防汛准备工作
    本报讯　19日闭幕的河北省防汛工作会议向全省人民提出了新的任务：防止任何麻痹自满思想，提前作好防汛准备，保证农业大丰收。
    去冬以来，河北省水利建设有了极大的发展，有部分群众和干部产生了麻痹自满思想，认为水利工程修了这样多，发生洪水也不会出什么问题。因此，会议要求各地在群众和干部中开展以贯彻今年防汛任务和要求为中心的大辩论，让人们认识到河北省历来春旱秋涝的自然规律，提高警惕，鼓足干劲，加强准备，保证防汛斗争的全面胜利。
    会议指出：在防汛工作中要进一步发扬去冬兴修水利以来出现的共产主义协作精神，各地在特大洪水时，必须根据上、下游兼顾、面线结合、统一安排的精神，打破县、乡界限，合力支援有困难的地区，汛期中的排水和用水矛盾问题，也要本着共产主义大协作精神求得合理解决。
    会议决定今年河北省的防汛工作要来一个战略性的转变，要由过去点线的消极的防御，转变为全面的积极的进攻，调度洪水为生产服务，会议对此进行了详细的研究和部署，并要求各地县以上的防汛指挥机构在6月1日建立好和行动起来，6月10日以前完成防汛准备工作大检查。
