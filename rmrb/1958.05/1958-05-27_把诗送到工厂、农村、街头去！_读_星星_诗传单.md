Send Poetry to Factories, Villages, and Streets!
　　-- Reading "Stars" Poetry Flyers
　　An Qi
　　Poetry is always most active whenever a revolutionary upsurge arrives.
　　During the upsurge of the Anti-Japanese War, during the upsurge of the Liberation War, many revolutionary poets went to the countryside, went to factories, went to the streets, went to the war-torn mountains and fields, writing their fiery and sharp verses on walls, on cliffs, on the main roads that the enemy had to pass, and in the hearts of the people. Many short and pithy verses, we can still remember today.
　　Now, we have arrived at a new revolutionary high tide period – the period of the socialist Great Leap Forward, our poetry has inherited its glorious fighting tradition, and together with the workers' and peasants' Great Leap Forward folk songs, it has appeared again in factories, villages, and streets.
　　"Street Poetry" has appeared at the entrance of the Chinese Writers Association in Beijing, and "Poetry and Painting Windows" co-created by poets and painters have appeared on the streets of Chongqing. The "Stars" poetry magazine, with a completely new look after the downfall of the Rightists, scattered tens of thousands of poetry flyers on the "May Day" holiday.
　　The advertisement for this poetry flyer is also a poem. In this poetic advertisement, it explains the task of the poetry flyer very clearly and neatly:
　　Stars Poetry Flyer, made for workers and peasants to see;
　　Go up the mountains and down to the countryside, to the workshops, please post it and pass it around.
　　On this poetry flyer, there is an unusual photograph. What appears before us is the foot of Qingcheng Mountain. Below the mountain, the Min River flows in the mist, and the ancient suspension bridge is like a dragon spanning the Min River. At the foot of the mountain stands our most beloved Chairman Mao. Next to this photo is a poem – "Chairman Mao Arrived at Dujiangyan" by Lü Bing, which not only depicts the scene of Chairman Mao visiting Dujiangyan, but also conveys the ecstatic feelings of the Sichuan people towards Chairman Mao's arrival.
　　The names of the poets who excited people with their street poetry during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War have now reappeared here with the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward: Tian Jian gave us a "Socialist Flyer," and Ge Bizhou gave us a poem "Support." We also see young poets Gu Gong and Fu Chou here, they have now also become a vital force in street poetry.
　　Whether they are old poets, new authors, workers, or peasants, a common characteristic of their poems is that they are short and pithy, all filled with the enthusiasm of the Great Leap Forward, exuding the rough and bold atmosphere of battle, and reflecting the current hot and lively reality.
　　Of course, we are not yet satisfied with this poetry flyer. We hope that the poems on the flyer will have more abundant emotions, louder syllables, and more concise and pithy forms, so that they will not only be printed on the flyer, but also be printed in the hearts of the people; so that they will not only play an encouraging role in the current production, but also play a demonstrative role in creatively learning folk songs and ballads.
　　We hope that more poets will write street poetry, and that more literary publications will print and distribute poetry flyers, sending poetry to factories, villages, and streets!

### 把诗送到工厂、农村、街头去！——读“星星”诗传单

    把诗送到工厂、农村、街头去！
    ——读“星星”诗传单
  　安旗
    每当革命高潮到来时，诗歌总是最活跃的。
    在抗日战争的高潮中，在解放战争的高潮中，许多革命诗人走向农村，走向工厂，走向街头，走向战火迷漫的山野，把他们的火热的犀利的诗句写在墙头上，写在岩壁上，写在敌人必经的大路上，写在老百姓的心上。有许多短小精悍的诗句，我们至今还能记住。
    现在，我们又到了一个新的革命高潮时期——社会主义大跃进时期，我们的诗歌继承了它的光荣的战斗传统，和工人农民的大跃进的歌谣一起又出现在工厂、农村和街头了。
    在北京中国作家协会的门首出现了“街头诗”，在重庆的街头出现了诗人与画家合作的“诗画窗”，而反掉右派以后的面貌焕然一新的“星星”诗刊，又在“五一”节撒出了成千上万的诗传单。
    这张诗传单的广告也是诗，在这则诗广告中，它把诗传单的任务交代得很明白，而且干净利落：
    星星诗传单，办给工农看；
    上山下乡到车间，请你张贴请传观。
    在这张诗传单上，有一张不同寻常的照片，出现在我们眼前的是青城山麓。山下，岷江在烟霭中奔流，古老的索桥像一条苍龙横跨在岷江上。山麓上立着我们最敬爱的毛主席。紧靠着这幅照片旁边有一首诗——履冰的“毛主席到了都江堰”，不但给我们描绘出毛主席参观都江堰的画面，而且传达出了四川人民对毛主席到来的狂喜的心情。
    在抗日战争、解放战争时期，就以他们的街头诗激动过人心的诗人们的名字，现在又随着大跃进的高潮出现在这里：田间给了我们一张“社会主义传单”，戈壁舟给了我们一首“支援”。我们在这里还看见青年诗人顾工和傅仇，他们现在也成了街头诗的生力军。
    不论是老诗人，新作者，工人，农民，他们的诗的一个共同的特点就是短小精悍，都洋溢着大跃进的热情，散发着粗犷的战斗的气息，反映着当前的热火朝天的现实。
    当然，我们对这张诗传单还不满足，我们希望传单上的诗，情绪更饱满一些，音节更响亮一些，形式更短小精悍一些，好让它们不仅仅印在传单上，而且要让它们印在人民的心上；好让它们不仅仅对当前的生产起一种鼓舞作用，而且在创造性地学习民歌民谣上也能起一种示范作用。
    希望更多的诗人来写街头诗，更多地文艺刊物来印发诗传单，把诗送到工厂、农村、街头去！
