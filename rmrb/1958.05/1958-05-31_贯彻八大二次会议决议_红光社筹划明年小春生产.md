Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Huandou reports: The Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, which Chairman Mao visited two months ago, expects its total output of spring grain crops this year to reach more than 1.3 million jin, an increase of more than two times compared to last year. Now, all members of the cooperative have proposed the battle cry of "Thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress," "Go all out, aim high, and strive for progress, to further respond to Chairman Mao's concern," aiming to become a "double-thousand jin cooperative" this year, and they have already taken action.

　　When the reporter arrived at the cooperative on the 27th, it felt like encountering a victorious army, with all the members in high spirits. The main force of the spring production has already shifted to the great spring production, with only semi-able-bodied laborers transporting wheat and potatoes. On a small path in the fields, I met a group of female members returning from transplanting rice seedlings, led by a girl named Wang Zuyun. Chairman Mao had noticed an infected hand of hers and instructed the doctor to cure it thoroughly. Her sister told me that after Chairman Mao's visit, Wang Zuyun has been even more active in labor. These days, as soon as she finishes work, she rushes to the reading room to read the newspapers, wanting to know about Chairman Mao's meetings in Beijing. She plans to actively lead women to work and participate in activities such as literacy campaigns, eliminating the "four pests," and breeding superior seeds, to support the cooperative in achieving the agricultural development program.

　　Lin Saihua, who is fifty-seven years old and planting sweet potatoes in the field, has recently experienced an unusual ideological struggle, but has now emerged victorious. She had long intended to use the new sweet potato planting techniques she learned from her maiden home, but she was worried that planting them poorly would reduce production. The cadre stationed in the cooperative learned about this and went to explain to her the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, encouraging her to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Now, Lin Saihua has decided to boldly promote this new technology.

　　That evening, the cooperative cadres, based on the spirit of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's work report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, boldly planned for next year's spring crop production. After the meeting, everyone recalled the moment when Chairman Mao visited the Hongguang Cooperative and entered a rapeseed field, holding the rapeseed with his left hand and raising his right hand to chest height, asking, "Can it grow this tall?" Then he compared it to neck height, asking, "Can it grow this tall?" Finally, he compared it to the height of a person, asking, "Can it grow this tall?" Talking about this, they encouraged each other, saying that they must be people who dare to think and dare to act, people who dare to break superstitions and innovate.

    贯彻八大二次会议决议
    红光社筹划明年小春生产
    新华社成都28日电　新华社记者王焕斗报道：毛主席在两个月前到过的四川省郫县红光农业社，今年小春粮食作物总产量可以达到一百三十多万斤，比去年增产两倍以上。现在全社社员又提出“全力贯彻八大二次会议决议”、“鼓足干劲、力争上游，进一步回答毛主席的关怀”，今年成为双千斤社的战斗口号，并且已经行动起来。
    27日，记者来到这个社的时候，仿佛遇见了一支打了胜仗的部队，社员们个个兴高彩烈。小春生产的主力军已经转入大春生产，只有半劳力在搬运小麦和马铃薯。在一条田间小路上，我遇见了一队刚刚薅秧回来的女社员，打头的是个名叫王祖运的姑娘。她那时有一只化了脓的手被毛主席发现了，当时主席就嘱咐医生给她彻底治好。她的姐姐告诉我，毛主席来过以后，王祖运劳动更加积极了，这几天她一收工回来，就赶到阅览室看报，她是要看毛主席在北京开会的事情。她准备积极带动妇女出工，并且参加扫盲、除四害、繁殖良种等活动，支持社里实现农业发展纲要。
    正在田里栽红薯的林赛华今年五十七岁了，她在最近经历了一番不平常的思想斗争，现在已经胜利了。她早就有意把从娘家学来的栽红薯的新技术使用上，可是又担心栽得不好要减产。驻社干部知道了，就去给她讲解“八大”第二次会议的精神，鼓励她要敢想、敢说、敢做。现在林赛华已决定大胆推行这项新技术。
    这天晚上，社干部根据刘少奇同志在“八大”第二次会议所作的工作报告的精神，大胆筹划了明年的小春生产。会后大家回忆起毛主席在红光社的时刻，曾经走进一块油菜田，左手握着油菜，右手伸到齐胸的高度问：“能不能长这么高？”又比到齐颈的高度问：“能不能长这么高？”最后一次比到一人来高问：“能不能长这么高？”谈到这里，他们互相勉励说，一定要当一个敢想敢为的人，敢于破除迷信、革新创造的人。
