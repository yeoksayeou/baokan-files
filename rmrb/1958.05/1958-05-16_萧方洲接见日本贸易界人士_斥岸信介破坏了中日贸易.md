Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Xiao Fangzhou, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, met with representatives from twenty Japanese trading companies before their departure from Beijing and discussed the current state of Sino-Japanese trade.

Xiao Fangzhou told the Japanese trade representatives: The trade edifice built by the people of China and Japan through more than six years of effort has been toppled by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. We cannot help but feel extremely indignant about this.

After reviewing the development of Sino-Japanese trade over the past few years, Xiao Fangzhou pointed out that the Chinese government has consistently given active support to the efforts made by the people of both countries in developing bilateral trade. However, Nobusuke Kishi has always held a hostile attitude towards China. Recently, in order to ingratiate himself with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Nobusuke Kishi openly sabotaged the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and condoned thugs insulting our national flag in Nagasaki. This shows that the Kishi government's hostile attitude towards China has reached an intolerable level. The conditions for trade between the people of the two countries based on equality, mutual benefit, and friendship have been completely undermined by the Kishi government. Xiao Fangzhou said that under these circumstances, the Chinese government's decision to suspend the issuance of import and export licenses to Japan, in accordance with the demands of the Chinese people, is entirely correct. As for when bilateral trade will resume, this depends on Nobusuke Kishi's thorough change of his hostile attitude towards China.

Xiao Fangzhou reiterated that the Chinese people have friendly aspirations towards the Japanese people. This has been the case in the past and present, and will not change in the future.

Xiao Fangzhou said that after the Sino-Japanese trade was undermined by the Kishi government, it will undoubtedly cause considerable losses to Japanese business and trade circles. It must be pointed out that this responsibility should be entirely borne by Nobusuke Kishi.

During the meeting, the Japanese trade representatives expressed their concern about the losses that the Japanese economy would suffer after the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade and expressed their strong dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and his undermining of Sino-Japanese trade. The Japanese trade representatives also stated that after returning to Japan, they would work with the Japanese people to demand that the Japanese government change its unfriendly attitude towards China as soon as possible, so as to restore Sino-Japanese trade as soon as possible.

Xiao Fangzhou finally expressed his belief that the efforts of Japanese trade friends will surely be successful.

    萧方洲接见日本贸易界人士
　　斥岸信介破坏了中日贸易
    新华社15日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会副秘书长肖方洲在日本二十个贸易公司的代表离开北京回国前夕接见了他们，就目前中日贸易局面问题进行了谈话。
    萧方洲对日本贸易界人士说：中日两国人民经过六年多努力建筑起来的贸易大楼，已经被日本首相岸信介推倒了。对此，我们不能不感到万分的愤慨。
    萧方洲回顾了几年来中日发展贸易的经过以后指出，中国政府对于两国人民在发展两国贸易方面所作的努力，一贯给予积极的支持。而岸信介则始终对中国抱着敌视的态度。最近岸信介为讨好美国和蒋介石集团，公然破坏了中日第四次贸易协定，并且又在长崎纵容歹徒侮辱我国国旗。这说明岸信介政府敌视中国的态度已经到了令人不能容忍的地步。两国人民间在平等互利和友好基础上进行贸易的条件，已经被岸信介政府彻底破坏。萧方洲说，在这种情况下，中国政府根据中国人民的要求，停止签发对日进出口许可证，这是完全正确的。至于两国贸易何时恢复的问题，这要由岸信介彻底改变敌视中国的态度来决定。
    萧方洲重申，中国人民对日本人民是有着友好愿望的。过去和现在如此，将来也不会改变。
    萧方洲说，中日两国的贸易被岸信介政府破坏以后，对日本工商界、贸易界，不成问题会造成相当大的损失，必须指出，这一责任完全应由岸信介承担。
    在接见的时候，日本贸易界人士在发言中，对中日贸易中断后对日本经济将要受到的损失表示忧虑，对岸信介敌视中国人民、破坏中日贸易的行为十分不满。日本贸易界人士还表示，回日本以后要和日本人民一起进行努力，要求日本政府早日改变对中国的不友好态度，从而尽早恢复中日贸易。
    萧方洲最后相信，日本贸易界朋友的努力一定会有所成就。
