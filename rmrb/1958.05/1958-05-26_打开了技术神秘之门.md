Opened the Door to Technical Mystery
Li Xingfa, Director of Changxing Refractory Material Factory, Zhejiang

After three years of arduous and tortuous road without capital, equipment, and workers who do not understand technology, the Changxing Refractory Material Factory in Zhejiang Province has now become a high-grade refractory material manufacturing factory with a preliminary scale. This was indeed something that many people dared not imagine at the beginning. Well-meaning people were once worried about us, and some ill-intentioned people also ridiculed us. However, we have overcome many difficulties and broken through the door of technical mystery.

Hard Work, Starting from Scratch

In September 1954, several of our demobilized soldiers returned to our hometown of Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, from Korea and Tibet. Under the education of the Party, we abandoned selfish plans such as preparing to establish a small family and doing small business, and with the ideal of being a "Golden Star Hero," we came to participate in the socialist construction of our motherland. According to the shortage of refractory material production in our country, we put together 3,700 yuan of demobilization pay as factory construction funds, and prepared to set up a refractory material factory. When this idea of ​​ours was spread, many people held a skeptical attitude and talked about it: "It's really whimsical to think that running a factory is too simple. Without the three capitals of funds, equipment, and technology, it is impossible to succeed." Some people were infinitely worried about us and advised us: "With this little money of yours, you should do something else!" Indeed, our only three thousand yuan was not enough to build a factory building or a kiln, nor was it enough to build a large chimney. However, our ideas have received great support from the Party. The Changxing County Party Committee has vigorously encouraged us to overcome difficulties and must run the factory well. The county civil affairs section and the conscription bureau specifically helped us, greatly encouraging our courage. We invited twenty-two comrades who returned from the army together, and established a factory construction preparatory committee. We had no money to build a factory building, so we borrowed a dilapidated temple; we couldn't afford to build a kiln, so we rented the kiln of a nearby pottery factory; we had no tools, so we made wooden hammers and wooden models with our own hands. Our twenty-two people, plus two technical workers we hired, were all the workers in this factory. The factory director and managers were all concurrently held by workers. After three or four months of running around, the factory was built in a dilapidated temple.

We started manufacturing the simplest fire clay fittings, porcelain bottles, white materials, and other products. However, apart from the two technical workers, most of us could only undertake some auxiliary work. Everyone had never even seen refractory materials. Even manufacturing such products was very difficult. During the trial production of the first batch of products, all 24 workers in the factory squatted beside the kiln for fifteen days and nights, but three kilns were burned and failed. This was like a basin of cold water poured on our heads. At the same time, because the products could not be sold, the working capital was used up shortly after the start of work, and even the factory's food could not be solved. At this time, there was a lot of discussion in the society, accusing us of "messing around" and "demobilized soldiers can't make a name for themselves, and they will definitely collapse in less than three months." Some people in the factory also began to waver, asking to disband and seek other livelihoods; some people also proposed that the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Conscription Bureau provide relief or find a way to loan to maintain the factory. Although most people wanted to continue running the factory, they had no way to do it. At this time, the factory's Party branch united some of the backbone of the factory, resolutely opposed this wavering and erroneous proposition, and proposed a method of self-reliance and overcoming difficulties, and mobilized everyone to discuss it. After a fierce ideological struggle, everyone unified their thinking and realized that we have no experience in construction, and difficulties are inevitable. The problem is to dare to overcome difficulties. Everyone said: "Revolutionary soldiers can win battles on the battlefield, how can they be deserters on the industrial front?" Facing difficulties and overcoming difficulties, this heroic spirit of revolutionary soldiers encouraged everyone, and some people who had wavered before also expressed their determination to run the factory well. In this way, everyone unanimously chose the road of self-reliance and overcoming difficulties. Under the mobilization of the Party branch, everyone increased their investment in the factory, some sold watches and bicycles, some sold houses and beds, and some borrowed the remaining demobilization subsidy to the factory. The branch also put forward the slogan of "save every penny and strive to accumulate factory funds," and everyone tightened their belts, only eating and not taking wages, and the cost of food was reduced to the lowest standard; if there were no raw materials, they would mine themselves; in order to save transportation costs, from the factory director to the cook, they personally transported raw materials to other places day and night, crossing mountains and ridges. Comrades with family burdens, the branch organized everyone to help each other, organized family members to go up the mountain to cut firewood and engage in sideline businesses, pick wild vegetables and dig kudzu vines to fill their stomachs, and took the food that one person ate in the factory home for two people to eat. All the workers in the factory, not afraid of hardship, encouraged each other, and were determined to run the factory well. Technical workers worked hard day and night, and in the absence of experience and rudimentary tools and equipment, they spent their efforts to trial-produce products. Finally, after the Spring Festival in 1955, the trial production of the first batch of products was successful, and was adopted by the using unit, and received their praise, and continued to order two hundred sets from us. This enabled us to break through the first difficulty.

"Destroy Capitalism and Promote Proletarian Ideology", Raise Awareness

When the factory was still in difficulty, the comrades lived a hard life, but everyone had no complaints. However, when the production developed slightly and there was a surplus, some people were unwilling to continue to be so arduous. There were two different views among the people: one was that most of the Party members and a part of the masses advocated enduring hardship first and then enjoying happiness, continuing to fight hard for a period of time, accumulating more funds, and laying a solid foundation for the great development of the factory; the other was that a small number of Party members and a small number of workers believed that now that production was normal and conditions were good, running a factory had to pay wages, and they demanded to divide the only accumulation. Some workers even wanted to withdraw their investment and go home to do business. It was very obvious that if we divided the only accumulation at that time, the factory would still be in a difficult situation and there was a risk of collapse at any time; if we wanted to make the factory continue to develop, we could only continue to fight hard and invest the accumulation in expanding reproduction. The debate over which of the above two views would win or lose had become the key to whether the factory could continue to move forward at that time. The Party branch organized Party members to discuss these two views, and went deep into the masses to listen to their opinions. Most of the Party members and workers said: "We have worked like we are on the battlefield, and the factory has not been finally completed, how can we divide this little money? Absolutely not!" At the workers' meeting, we let everyone discuss this matter together, and announced the total account of income and expenditure since the establishment of the factory. The workers' awareness was therefore raised, and they severely criticized the erroneous thinking of a small number of workers who wanted to divide the accumulation and attempt to take the capitalist road. In particular, those workers who had sold their property to help the factory solve its difficulties more resolutely opposed the proposition of dividing the accumulation. They said: "All our hopes are pinned on the future of the factory. Today, production is just normal, and some people actually want to separate the family. This is actually dismantling our home." In this way, on the basis of the unanimous thinking of the vast majority of Party members and the masses, we invested the only accumulation in expanding reproduction, expanded two high-temperature down-draft kilns, built new factory buildings, and purchased a part of the tools, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of the factory.

Hard Study and Hard Work, Improve Technology

In the early stage of running the factory, the factory could only produce some ordinary refractory materials. In order to produce more products, it was necessary to improve technology. Whether or not we could study hard, work hard, and improve technology became another difficulty standing in front of us. Many people doubted us and laughed at us: how can these rough soldiers master profound technology? But we don't believe these superstitions. The workers brought into play an amazing spirit of hard study and hard work, and adopted the method of master teaching apprentice, and apprentice teaching apprentice. Everyone quickly learned the operating technology. Every time a new product is made, the technical workers must first act as teachers, make models, explain while demonstrating on the spot, and the apprentices learn to do the same. After learning, they operate independently. In production, those who learn technology well help those who are poor to improve their technology together. At the same time, the method of regular sampling inspection and collective evaluation of products is also used to encourage everyone to improve technology. If a product is made badly, a production research meeting will be held to jointly "suppress the enemy." Everyone looks for the reasons and thinks of ways. When encountering complicated problems that the "native engineers" cannot solve, they run to Shanghai to ask the Metallurgical Ceramics Research Institute, Xinyie Electric Furnace Factory and other units for technical guidance; and they take back the imported materials left over from the big factories and study them as learning specimens. In this way, after only more than a year, the technical level of the whole factory has been greatly improved, and four technicians have been trained; the original twenty-two demobilized soldiers have been able to independently master the operation of the thirteen processes of the whole factory's production, of which fifteen people have reached the technical level of four to six, and some comrades can also understand process design drawings.

Bold Trial Production, Two Thousand Varieties

Our technology and product quality have been improving day by day, and we have gained the trust of all parties. At the same time, with the large-scale development of national economic construction and science and technology, all parts of the country require us to manufacture new products with higher quality and new varieties with multiple specifications, especially many special products that our country could not make in the past. We have not only never produced these products before, but have never even seen them. To trial-produce such products is undoubtedly a great difficulty for this small factory with low technology and poor equipment. Can we carry out the trial production of these new high-grade products in large quantities? Some people have worried about this problem. They said: There is no technology and no decent equipment. To make products like imported goods is really absurd. Isn't the scientists of other countries eating dry food? We have no scientists and no engineers. How can we succeed?! They suggested: We should be more stable, produce some ordinary products and live a peaceful life, otherwise the products will not be produced, and not only will the plan not be completed, but the fines will bring down the factory. To be honest, we are not completely sure about trial-producing these new products. But how can we watch the needs of the country and not try? We saw many telegrams from units ordering from us, some even brought banners to order from us, and some stipulated that the goods should be sent by plane to catch up with the construction task. The needs of the country encouraged our enthusiasm and enabled us to boldly accept orders from all parties and carry out trial production. Our method is to rely on the hard work of all the workers in the factory and think of local methods. Many new products have not been seen by workers before trial production. Most of them only have a two-dimensional drawing and usage requirements, and it is rare to attach a foreign-made waste old object. We have no information, and we can't test foreign-made samples ourselves, so we ask the Shanghai Academy of Sciences to help test. We look at foreign reference materials, and if we don't understand English, we ask middle school teachers to help translate. If there is no testing equipment for the products made, we send them to the user unit for testing once, so we test and improve them at the same time. All the workers in the factory brought into play their revolutionary drive and perseverance, and made great achievements under the simple equipment and manual operation. For example, the thermocouple tubes used by the Shanghai Instrument Factory used to be products from West Germany, and their temperature resistance was only 1,300 degrees Celsius, which did not meet the production requirements. They asked us to trial-produce them. This kind of electric couple tube requires no softening, strong abrupt change, and must be able to withstand rapid heating and rapid cooling, which is very difficult to manufacture. We failed after more than a year of continuous testing. We were fined and suffered a lot of sarcasm. But we are still not discouraged, and finally succeeded in making it with local methods. The temperature resistance reached 1,750 degrees Celsius, and the abrupt change performance exceeded that of West German products by one time. Another example is the trial production of high-temperature molybdenum wire furnace tubes, which requires a fire resistance of 1,870 degrees Celsius, but the highest temperature of our down-draft kiln can only burn to 1,400 degrees Celsius. One kiln was burned out during the trial production. It took half a year and did not succeed. The workers were still full of confidence. They said: "If we don't try, others won't try either. No one will make advanced refractory materials. Since it is made by humans, if foreigners can do it, we can do it too." Finally, with the joint efforts of technicians and workers, it was made, and the quality was very good. Now this product has been sold to more than 50 factories across the country. In January this year, units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Central Iron and Steel Research Institute studied the use of alumina balls to refine iron, which can increase the melting capacity by 4% and reduce coke by 4%. This is the latest steelmaking method. In order to obtain alumina balls, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant went to Tangshan, Anshan, Shandong and other places to order them, because some factories were unwilling to trial-produce them, so they asked us to trial-produce them. When the workers knew that there would be many difficulties in trial-producing this product, the Party branch of the factory mobilized everyone: If others can't do it, we must make it. As long as we break the mysterious concept, study hard and work hard, we can succeed. In this way, under the trial and research of everyone, the key of "sintering" was solved, and the alumina balls were successfully trial-produced in March and put into mass production in April. There are also glass fiber crucibles, which used to use foreign-imported platinum crucibles, each costing 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the quantity was very small, which could not meet the domestic demand. We broke the mysterious concept of "no substitutes can be found" and also made substitute alumina crucibles with local methods, each costing only 80 yuan.

In the past three years, with the help of all parties, we have trial-produced and produced more than 2,000 new products and new varieties with poor methods and local methods, which has played a certain role in saving national foreign exchange and supporting industrial construction.

Unite and Cooperate, Catch Up with Britain

The achievement of trial-producing new products has opened up a broad prospect for the factory. At present, more than 400 large-scale factories, mines, and scientific and chemical research units in China have established regular processing and ordering relationships with us. Now the face of our factory has been greatly changed. The whole factory has nearly 200 employees, the factory building covers an area of ​​nearly 10,000 square meters, and the production equipment has also been greatly improved. In the past three years, the output value has increased 30 times. Recently, all our employees further discussed and revised the second five-year plan, and unanimously decided that the annual output value will reach 38 million yuan in 1962, an increase of 87 times compared with 1957. In terms of products, we require to catch up with or surpass Britain in one to three years respectively, and strive to sell some important products to foreign countries. From our personal experience in the past three years, we have deeply realized that poverty is not terrible, and not understanding technology is not terrible. These difficulties can be overcome. As long as we can break superstitions, liberate our minds, what foreigners can do, we can do; what foreigners cannot do, we can also do. We firmly believe that as long as we resolutely follow the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical, boosting our energy, and striving for the upper reaches" proposed by the Central Committee, we will surely be able to catch up with or surpass Britain in a short period of time.

    打开了技术神秘之门
    浙江长兴耐火器材厂厂长　李兴发
    浙江省长兴耐火器材厂在没有资金、设备、工人不懂技术的情况下，经过三年艰难曲折的道路，现在已经成了一个具有初步规模的高级耐火器材制造厂。这在当初的确是许多人所不敢设想的。好心肠的人们曾经为我们忧虑过，一些不怀好意的人也曾嘲笑过我们。但是，我们走过了重重难关，打破了技术的神秘之门。
    艰苦奋斗，白手起家
    1954年9月间，我们几个复员军人从朝鲜、西藏等地回到了故乡——浙江长兴县。我们在党的教育下，丢弃了准备建立小家庭、做小买卖等自私的打算，抱着“金星英雄”一样的理想，来参加祖国的社会主义建设。我们根据本国耐火器材生产缺乏的情况，凑起三千七百元复员费作为建厂资金，准备办一个耐火器材厂。当我们这种设想一被传开的时候，有很多人抱着怀疑的态度，纷纷谈论：“真是异想天开，把办工厂看得太简单了，没有资金、设备、技术这三套本钱，休想成功”，也有些人为我们抱着无穷的忧虑，规劝我们：“你们这一点钱，还是做些其他事情吧！”的确，我们这仅有的三千多元钱既不够造一间厂房或者一个窑，也不够造一个大烟囱。但是，我们的想法却得到了党的极大的支持，长兴县委竭力鼓励我们克服困难，一定要把工厂办好。县民政科、兵役局具体帮助了我们，大大地鼓舞了我们的勇气。我们邀集了二十二个部队里一起回来的同志，成立了建厂筹备委员会。我们没有钱造厂房，就借用破庙；造不起窑，就租用附近陶器厂的窑；没有工具，就用自己双手做木锤和木模型。我们二十二个人加上请来的两个技术工人，就是这个工厂的全部工人，厂长、管理人员都由工人兼任。经过了三、四个月的奔波，就这样在一个破庙里把工厂建立起来了。
    我们开始制造最简单的火泥配件和瓷瓶、白料等产品。但是我们除了两个技术工人外，大多数人只能担任一部分辅助工作，大家连耐火器材也没有见过，即使是制造这样的产品，也很困难。在首批产品试制的时候，全厂二十四个工人蹲在窑旁度过了十五个昼夜，但是连烧了三窑都失败了。这像一盆冷水泼在我们的头上。同时，由于产品卖不出去，开工后不久，流动资金就用完了，连厂里的伙食也没法解决了。这时社会上议论纷纷，指责我们“瞎弄、胡闹”，“转业军人搞不出名堂来，不出三个月保险垮台”。厂内有的人也开始动摇了，要求散伙另谋生计；也有些人提出要民政局和兵役局救济或设法贷款来维持工厂。多数人虽然想把工厂办下去，但也没有办法。这时，厂党支部团结了一些办厂的骨干，坚决反对了这种动摇和错误的主张，提出了自立更生、克服困难的办法，并且发动大家讨论。经过了激烈的思想斗争，大家才统一了思想，认识到我们搞建设没有经验，困难是难免的，问题就在要敢于克服困难。大家说：“革命军人在战场上能打胜仗，在工业战线上怎么可以当逃兵？”正视困难、战胜困难，这种革命军人的英雄气概，鼓舞了大家，一些原先动摇的人，也表示决心要办好工厂。这样大家一致选择了自力更生、克服困难的道路。在党支部的发动下，大家纷纷增资办厂，有的变卖了手表、脚踏车，有的变卖了房屋、床铺，也有的把多余下来的一点转业资助金借给工厂。支部还提出了“节省每一分钱，为积累工厂资金而奋斗”的口号，大家都节衣缩食，只吃饭不拿工资，每天两粥一饭，菜金降到了最低标准；原料没有，自己开矿；为了节省搬运费，从厂长到炊事员都不分昼夜翻山越岭到外地亲自搬运原料。有家庭负担的同志，支部就组织大家互助互济，组织家属上山砍柴、搞副业，采野菜、挖葛藤当饭充饥，并且把工厂里一个人吃的伙食拿回家两个人吃。全厂职工，不怕艰苦，互相鼓励，决心要把工厂办好。技术工人们夜以继日地苦学苦练，在没有经验和工具设备简陋的情况下，花尽心血试制产品。终于在1955年春节后，首批产品试制获得成功，被使用单位采用了，并且得到了他们好评，向我们继续订货二百套。这就使我们突破了第一道难关。“灭资兴无”，提高觉悟
    当工厂还处在困难的情况下，同志们过着艰苦的生活，但大家都毫无怨言。可是，当生产发展稍有盈余的时候，有些人就不愿再这样艰苦下去。人们中间有两种不同的主张：一种是大部分党员和一部分群众，主张先苦后甜、继续苦战一个时期，积累更多的资金，为工厂的大发展打个牢固的基础；另一种是少数党员和少部分职工却认为现在生产正常了，条件好了，办工厂就得给工资了，要求分掉仅有的一点积累。有的工人并且要抽出投资回家做生意。十分明显，那时如果我们把仅有的一点积累分了，工厂就会仍然处于困难的情况下，随时有垮台的危险；要使工厂继续发展只有继续苦战，把积累投入扩大再生产。以上这两种主张的争论，谁胜谁败，在当时已经成了工厂能否继续前进的关键。党支部组织党员讨论了这两种主张，并且深入到群众中去听取群众的意见。大多数党员和工人说：“我们像上战场一样的干过，工厂还没有最后办成，怎能把这一点点钱分了呢？坚决不成！”在职工大会上，我们又把这件事让大家来共同讨论，并且公布了建厂以来的收支总账。职工们的觉悟因此提高了，严厉地批判了少数工人想分掉积累企图走资本主义道路的错误思想。特别那些曾经变卖财产帮助工厂解决困难的工人更坚决地反对了分掉积累的主张。他们说：“我们一切希望都寄赖于工厂的前途，今天生产刚刚正常，居然有人要分家，这实际上是要拆我们的家”。这样就在绝大多数党员和群众思想一致的基础上，我们把仅有的积累投入了扩大再生产，扩建了二座高温倒焰窑，新建了厂房，并且购置了一部分工具，为工厂的发展建立了初步基础。
    苦学苦钻，提高技术
    办厂初期厂里只能生产一些普通的耐火材料，为了要生产更多的产品，必须提高技术。能不能苦学苦钻、提高技术，成了横在我们面前的又一道难关。许多人怀疑我们，嘲笑我们：这些当兵的大老粗，怎么能掌握高深的技术呢？但是我们不相信这些迷信。职工们发挥了惊人的苦学苦钻的精神，采取了师傅带徒弟，徒弟又带徒弟的办法，大家迅速学会了操作技术。每作一个新产品，必先由技术工人作老师，作出模型，一边讲解，一边现场表演，徒弟照样学着做，学会后才各自单独操作。在生产中技术学得好的人帮助差的人共同提高技术。同时还用定期抽查、集体评比制品的办法，鼓励大家提高技术。作坏了一件产品就召开生产研究会，会师“剿敌”，大家找原因、想办法。遇到复杂的、“土工程师”解决不了的问题，就跑到上海请冶金陶磁研究所、新业电炉厂等单位作技术指导；并把大厂用剩下来的进口货材料要回来琢磨，作为学习标本。这样，仅仅经过一年多的时间，全厂的技术水平有了很大的提高，培养出了四个技师；原来的二十二个复员军人，对全厂生产的十三道工序已经都能单独掌握操作，其中十五个人已经分别达到了四——六级的技术水平，有的同志还能看懂工艺设计图样。
    大胆试制，品种二千
    我们的技术和产品的质量日益提高，得到了各方面的信任。同时，随着国家经济建设和科学技术大规模的发展，全国各地都要求我们制造质量较高的新产品和多种规格的新品种，特别是许多本国过去不能自制的特殊产品。这些产品我们过去不仅没有生产过，也没有看见过。要试制这样的产品，对于这个技术低、设备差的小工厂不能不说是极大的困难。我们能不能大量地进行这种新的高级产品的试制工作呢？有人曾经耽心过这个问题，他们说：没有技术，又没有一点像样的设备，要造出进口货一样的产品，真是太荒唐了，人家的科学家不是吃干饭的，我们既无科学家，又无工程师，怎么能成？！他们提出：应该稳当一些，生产一些普通产品过过平安日子，否则产品出不了，不仅计划完不成，而且罚起款来会把工厂搞垮了。说实在话，我们试制这些新产品确实也是没有完全把握的。但是怎么可以看着国家的需要不去尝试呢？我们看到许多单位向我们订货的电报，有的甚至带了给我们的锦旗来订货，有的限定日期要把货用飞机送去赶建设任务。国家的需要鼓起了我们干劲，使我们大胆接受了各方面的订货任务，进行了试制工作。我们的办法是依靠全厂职工苦干、想土办法。许多新产品在试制前，工人没有见过实物，大都是只有一张平面图纸和使用要求，难得附寄一只外国制的废旧实物。我们没有资料，外国制的样品自己不会化验，就请上海科学院帮助化验。看外国的参考资料，不懂英文，就请中学教师帮助翻译。做出来的产品没有检验设备，就做一次送到使用单位试验一次，这样边试验、边改进。全厂职工发挥了革命的干劲和钻劲，在简陋的设备和手工操作之下，做出了很大的成绩。例如，上海仪表厂用的热电偶管，过去是用西德的产品，耐温度只有摄氏一千三百度，不合生产要求，他们要我们试制。这种电偶管要求不软化、急变性强，要能急热急冷，制造十分困难，我们经过一年多连续的试验都失败了，被罚了款，也遭受了不少冷言冷语。但是我们仍不灰心，终于用土办法制造成功了，耐温度达到摄氏一千七百五十度，急变性能比西德产品超过一倍。又如试制高温钼丝炉管，耐火度要达到摄氏一千八百七十度，但是我们倒焰窑最高温度只能烧到摄氏一千四百多度，试制中一只窑被烧坏了，时间花了半年，没有成功，工人们还是信心百倍，他们说：“我们不试，人家也不试，高级耐火材料就没有人做了，既然是人做的，外国人能做，我们也能做”，最后在技术员和工人的共同努力下制成了，并且质量很好。现在这种产品已经行销全国五十多家工厂了。今年一月，石景山钢铁厂、中央钢铁科学院等单位，研究用氧化铝球炼铁，熔量可提高4％，减少焦炭4％，这是一种最新的炼钢法。为了要氧化铝球，石景山钢铁厂曾到唐山、鞍钢、山东等地方去订货，因为有些厂不愿试制，他们要我们试制。职工知道在试制这一产品中会有很多困难，厂党支部动员大家：人家不会做，我们也要做成它；只要我们打破神秘观念，苦学苦钻，就能成功。就这样，氧化铝球在人人试、人人参加研究下，解决了“烧结”关键，在三月份试制成功了，四月份大批投入了生产。还有玻璃纤维坩埚，过去都用外国进口的白金埚，每只价四、五万元，而且数量很少，不能满足国内需要，我们打破了“无法找到代用品”的神秘观念，也用土办法制成了代用的氧化铝坩埚，每只价只有八十元。
    三年来，我们用穷办法、土办法，在各方面的帮助之下，试制与生产了二千多种新产品和新品种，对节省国家外汇，支援工业建设起了一定的作用。
    齐心合力，赶上英国
    试制新产品的成就，为工厂开辟了广阔的前途，目前国内已有四百多家大型厂矿和科学、化学研究单位和我们建立了经常的加工订货关系。现在我们工厂的面貌，已经大大改观。全厂有职工近二百人，厂房场地面积近一万平方公尺，生产设备也有很大改进，三年来产值增加了三十倍。最近，我们全体职工进一步讨论修订了第二个五年计划，一致决心在1962年年产值达到三千八百万元，比1957年增加八十七倍。在产品方面，我们要求分别在一至三年内赶上或超过英国，并争取某些重要产品远销国外。我们从三年来的切身经历，深刻地体会到：穷并不可怕，不懂技术也不可怕，这些困难都可以克服，只要我们能破除迷信，解放思想，外国人能做到的，我们也能做到；外国人不能做到的，我们也能做到。我们深信只要坚决遵循中央提出的“多快好省、鼓起干劲、力争上游”这条总路线，一定可以在短时期内赶上或超过英国。
