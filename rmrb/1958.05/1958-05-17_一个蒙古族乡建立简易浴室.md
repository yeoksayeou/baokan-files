A Mongolian Ethnic Township Builds Simple Bathhouses
    (Our dispatch) The fifty-seven production teams of the five agricultural cooperatives in Haode Mongolian Ethnic Township, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have recently built simple bathhouses, where male and female members can take turns enjoying hot baths.
    In the past, local farmers, limited by economic conditions and the cold climate, had mostly never been to a bathhouse. In winter, there was nowhere to bathe, and only in the brief summer could they cleanse themselves in rivers and ditches. Even this opportunity was rare for women. Therefore, the cooperative members were very enthusiastic about building bathhouses.
    These bathhouses were built by the masses themselves, utilizing available resources and local conditions. They used cooperative housing, with large vats and troughs as bathtubs, and large pots for heating water. The firewood was gathered by the members themselves. Each bathhouse only cost five or six yuan to build. Cooperative members do not pay any fees for bathing.

　　一个蒙古族乡建立简易浴室
    本报讯　黑龙江省肇源县浩德蒙古族乡五个农业社的五十七个生产队，最近都建立了简易浴室，男女社员都可以轮流洗到热水澡。
    过去当地农民因受经济条件限制和寒冷气候的影响，绝大部分没进过澡塘，冬季无处洗澡，只有短暂的夏季能在河沟里净净身，而妇女连这个机会也很难得，因而社员对修建浴室非常积极。
    这些浴室都是群众自己动手因陋就简地建立的，利用社里的房屋，用大缸、水槽等作浴盆，用大锅烧水，柴是社员自己弄的，每个浴室只花五、六元钱。社员洗澡不付任何费用。
