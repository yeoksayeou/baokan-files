    To Protect Large Trees
    During the large-scale afforestation campaign, some units, due to a shortage of saplings, cut off all the branches of large trees to use as cuttings, seriously damaging the growth and appearance of the large trees and destroying existing landscaping achievements.
    For example, the large trees on both sides of the Beijing-Baotou Railway line were stripped of all their branches by agricultural cooperatives along the railway line in Huai'an County, Hebei Province, and Daren, Yanggao, and Tianzhen Counties in Shanxi Province. Some trees became bald, and others looked like children's pigtails. The reasons for the indiscriminate felling and cutting of large trees, in addition to the shortage of saplings, included the desire of individual commune members to cut more for rice transplanting and earn more work points.
    Forestry departments in various regions should immediately take measures to stop and reverse the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling and cutting of large trees in order to ensure existing landscaping achievements.

    要保护大树
    在大规模造林运动中，有的单位由于树苗缺乏，就把大树枝全部砍掉作插穗，严重地损坏了大树的发育与美观，破坏了已有的绿化成果。
    例如京包铁路线两侧的大树，被河北省怀安县、山西省大仁、阳高、天镇等县沿铁路线的农业社将树枝全部砍掉，有的树成了秃子，有的就像小孩的发辫。造成滥伐乱砍大树的原因，除树苗缺外，还有个别社员是为了多砍插秧，多赚工分。
    各地林业部门应该立即采取措施，制止和扭转滥伐乱砍大树的现象，以保证已有的绿化成果。
