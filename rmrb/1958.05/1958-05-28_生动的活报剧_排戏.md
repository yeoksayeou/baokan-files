    Lively Living Newspaper “Rehearsal”
    Zhang Jichun

    After seeing the programs of the "Beijing Municipal Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Performance," many comrades praised the "Rehearsal" created and performed by the workers of the Xingping Machinery Factory, calling it an interesting living newspaper, a clever combination of comic dialogue and drama.

    Indeed, "Rehearsal" is a good play.

    Its theme is closely linked to the third stage of the rectification movement, dealing with the handling of mass-produced big-character posters. It frankly points out that some people, when dealing with big-character posters, do not humbly adopt the opinions put forward by the masses, but instead shirk their responsibilities, pushing away what they should handle. The play criticizes this kind of person by using the method of having off-stage and on-stage characters appear at the same time, and through the off-stage characters' views on the behavior of the on-stage characters, it implies that in the current era of rapid progress, this attitude is incompatible with the great socialist leap forward; it is necessary to change this shortcoming and add strength in order to catch up.

    The main character in the play is a section chief. The time is after the climax of the big-character poster campaign. This section chief and one of his staff members are diligently counting the number of big-character posters in order to compete with other units, constantly worrying about how to achieve the processing target of 80% or more, so as not to fall behind others. But the question is whether to honestly and cautiously handle the opinions put forward by the masses, or to perfunctorily muddle through? The two characters in the play did not clearly distinguish between these two approaches.

    The play ingeniously arranges a frank and straightforward off-stage character who relentlessly exposes the loopholes in the on-stage characters' handling of the big-character posters, thus creating a conflict between the on-stage and off-stage characters, turning the dull scenes of expressing thought processes into lively and dramatic effects. When the plot develops to the end, and the section chief is criticized by the masses in the play, the original contradictions in the play suddenly become clear and the rights and wrongs are clearly distinguished.

    The play begins very simply, with a person walking in front of the curtain to introduce that he is going to rehearse a play. Then a second person comes up and asks the first person: "What play are you rehearsing?" The answer is: "Rehearsing a play, just rehearsing a play."... With this question and answer, the audience thinks that it is a performance of a two-person comic dialogue. Then, the first person arranges seats for the second person and himself in the two corners of the stage, and explains that they should sit down quietly to watch the rehearsal. Only then, when the curtain is drawn open and the stage is revealed, do people realize that it really is a play being performed; the two people who have already appeared are actually a director and an audience member. What they are watching is the play performed by the section chief and the staff member. This technique of having a play within a play brings the benefit of being fascinating.

    I believe that short plays with such healthy content and lively forms, especially with simple performance conditions, are conducive to popularization and promotion. At the same time, it also demonstrates the precious amateur creative labor of the workers.

    生动的活报剧“排戏”
    张季纯
    看过“北京市群众文艺创作演出会”的节目以后，许多同志都称赞兴平机械厂工人同志们创作和演出的“排戏”，是一个有意思的活报剧，是相声和戏剧的巧妙结合。
    的确，“排戏”是一出好戏。
    它的题材紧密结合了整风运动第三阶段，对于群众性的大量大字报的处理问题。它直率地指出，有的人在处理大字报时不是虚心采纳群众提出的意见，而是推诿塞责，把自己应该办的事，推出去就算完了。这个戏对于这种人的批评运用了剧外人和剧中人同时出现的办法，通过剧外人对剧中人的行为所发表的观感，暗示出在当前激流涌进的时代中，这种态度是和伟大的社会主义大跃进的脉搏不相称的；必须改变这种缺点，增加一把力量，才能追上去，赶上去。
    剧中的主要人物是一位科长。时间是在大字报高潮以后。这位科长和他的一位科员为了和别的单位展开竞赛，正在辛勤地统计大字报的数字，时刻惦念着处理的指标如何达到80％以上，才不致于落在别人后边。可是问题却出在是老老实实、谦虚慎重地处理群众所提的意见呢？还是敷衍了事地蒙混“过关”呢？这两位剧中人正是在这样的问题上没有辨别清楚。
    这出戏别出心裁地安排了一位心直口快的剧外人，把他对剧中人处理大字报时的漏洞，随时都毫不留情地揭发出来，因而发生了剧中人和剧外人的矛盾，把那种表现思想过程的沉闷场面，变为活泼生动、富于戏剧性的效果了。当剧情发展到最后，那位科长受到剧中群众的指责时，剧中原来存在的矛盾便豁然开朗、是非分明。
    这出戏一开头非常平易，先是一个人走在幕前，向观众介绍他要排戏。接着上来第二个人，询问第一人：“排什么戏？”回答说：“排戏，就是排戏。”……这样一问一答，观众还以为是表演双人“相声”。接着，第一人给第二人和他自己在舞台两角安排好各人的座位，并且说明要静坐下来看排戏。再接下去是拉开幕布，显露出舞台面，人们才明白真是要演戏了；已经出场的两个人，原来是一位导演和一位观众。他们看的就是那位科长和科员演的戏。这种戏外有戏的手法，带来了引人入胜的好处。
    我认为像这样内容健康、形式活泼的短剧，特别是演出条件又简便，是有利于普及和推广的。同时，更表现了工人同志们珍贵的业余创作劳动。
