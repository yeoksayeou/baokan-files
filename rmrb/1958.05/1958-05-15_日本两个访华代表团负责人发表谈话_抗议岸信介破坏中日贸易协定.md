Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 14th:森健, the head of the Japanese Aichi Prefecture Peace Delegation, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters today protesting Kishida Nobusuke's measures to sabotage the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

森健 said that Kishida Nobusuke's actions to undermine Sino-Japanese trade are unsatisfactory to the Japanese people. Regarding the incident in which Kishida Nobusuke condoned Japanese thugs insulting the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki, 森健 believes that the opinion of the majority of Japanese people is that if Kishida Nobusuke views the current China with the perspective of twenty years ago and handles relations with China in the manner of twenty years ago, it will certainly not yield any results.

平冢信介, the deputy head of the Japan Youth Organization Council delegation visiting China, also told reporters that they are dissatisfied with the Kishida Nobusuke government's hostile attitude toward China. He said, "It can be asserted that Kishida Nobusuke's attitude is not based on equality to handle the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. If an equal attitude is adopted, even with the recent incidents, there could be better solutions."

　　日本两个访华代表团负责人发表谈话
　　抗议岸信介破坏中日贸易协定
    据新华社香港14日电　日本爱知县和平代表团团长森健今天对新华社记者发表谈话，抗议岸信介破坏日中第四次贸易协定的措施。
    森健说，岸信介破坏日中贸易的措施是日本人民不能满意的。对于岸信介纵容日本暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗的事件，森健认为，日本大多数人民的意见是，如果岸信介以二十年前的眼光看待现在的中国，以二十年前的方式来处理与中国之间的关系，是一定得不到结果的。
    日本青年团协议会访华代表团副团长平冢信介也对记者表示他们不满意岸信介政府敌视中国的态度。他说：“可以断言，岸信介的态度不是在平等的基础上来处理中日之间的关系问题的。如果采取平等态度的话，尽管最近发生了一些事件，也能够有更好的处理办法。”
