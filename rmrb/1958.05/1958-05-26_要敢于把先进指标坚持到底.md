    Dare to Persist in Advanced Indicators to the End
    Tian Lianqian
    Since the Dengxing Village Agricultural Cooperative in Jinping County, Guizhou Province, entered the intense spring plowing season, the difficulty of insufficient labor has become increasingly prominent. Despite rushing day and night, the farm work still cannot be completed. What to do? Some people advocate: "Rest wherever you get to, do as much as you can!" Some believe that the labor shortage is caused by the increased production target of 1,100 jin of grain per mu. Lowering the target would reduce the amount of labor required, and the labor force would be sufficient. In fact, these two opinions amount to the same thing: lowering the target, only expressed in different forms. Activists opposed this opinion, advocating that the original production increase plan must be achieved no matter what. However, there were two opinions on how to achieve the original target: one was "rest for a few days and continue the night battles"; the other was "use technological innovation to replace night battles." The Party branch supported the latter opinion and put forward a slogan: "Use the energy of night battles to engage in technological innovation, and transform heavy farm tools into lightweight farm tools!" After a great debate and careful calculation, everyone recognized that this was the path to achieve the production increase plan. In a very short period, more than one hundred tools were created and improved, greatly increasing labor efficiency and resolving the difficulty of insufficient labor. This made it possible to maintain the original production increase target.
    This incident tells us that there is not only ideological struggle when formulating plans, but also ideological struggle in the process of implementing them. If the focus of the debate in the previous period was on whether or not to dare to determine leaping indicators, then now the focus of the debate is on whether or not to dare to overcome various difficulties and persist in the original leaping indicators to the end, striving to achieve them. Since it is executing a leaping plan, of course it will encounter greater and more difficulties than executing an ordinary plan. Moreover, some difficulties cannot be fully anticipated when formulating the plan (such as the sudden attack of serious disasters), so the plan may not have measures to deal with such unexpected difficulties. This situation will indeed greatly threaten the realization of the original plan. The "reason" for those who advocate lowering the indicators lies here. They would say: "Since these difficulties were not sufficiently estimated at the time, the original production increase target should of course be lowered accordingly!" On the surface, these people are very good at adapting to circumstances based on actual conditions. However, they have not done one of the most important tasks, which is to try every possible means to find the possibility of overcoming this difficulty. In fact, at the beginning of a relatively complex task, it is difficult to anticipate all the difficulties in advance, and it is also impossible to fully see all the growing favorable factors. The main problem is not to yield to difficulties, not to retreat in the face of difficulties; to keenly discover favorable factors, develop favorable factors, to overcome difficulties and defeat difficulties.
    Spear and shield are interdependent, and the possibility of difficulty and overcoming difficulty exists simultaneously. The correct attitude is not to lower the target as soon as you encounter difficulties, but to constantly seek and create measures and conditions to overcome difficulties and ensure the realization of the leaping indicators!

    要敢于把先进指标坚持到底
    田连阡
    贵州省锦屏县灯星村农业合作社进入紧张的春耕以来，劳力不足的困难一天比一天突出，尽管不分昼夜地突击，农活还是干不完。怎么办呢？有人主张：“走到哪里就歇哪里，做多少就算多少吧！”有人认为，劳力不足是因为亩产一千一百斤粮食的增产指标造成的，把指标降低一些，就能减少劳力的需要量，劳力也就够用了。实际上这两种意见是一个主张：把指标降低，只不过表现形式不同罢了。积极分子反对这个意见，主张无论如何也要实现原订增产计划。不过在怎样实现原订指标的方法上，又有两种意见：一种是“休息几天继续夜战”；一种是“用技术革新来代替夜战”。党支部支持后一种意见，提出了一个口号：“用夜战的劲头来搞技术革新，变笨重农具为轻巧农具！”经过大辩论，算细账，大家认清了这是实现增产计划应走的道路，在很短的期间，创造和改良了一百多件工具，劳动效率大大提高，劳动力不足的困难解决了。从而使原订的增产指标坚持下来。
    这件事告诉我们：不但在制订计划的时候有思想斗争，在执行计划的过程中也有思想斗争。如果说前一时期争论的焦点在于敢不敢确定跃进的指标，那么现在争论的焦点就在于敢不敢战胜各种各样的困难，把原订的跃进指标坚持到底，力争实现。既然是执行一个跃进的计划，当然比起执行平平常常的计划要碰上更大更多的困难。而且，有些困难是制订计划时无法完全预料到的（如严重灾害的突袭等），因而计划里面也可能没有应付这类意外困难的措施。这种情况的确会使原订计划的实现受到很大威胁。那些主张降低指标的人的“理由”也就在这里。他们会说：“既然这些困难当时估计不足，原来的增产指标当然应该相应地降低呀！”表面上看来，这些人是很善于从实际情况出发来变通行事的。可是他们有一件最紧要的工作没有做，就是千方百计地去寻找克服这种困难的可能性。实际上，在一件比较复杂的工作开始时，固然很难把所有的困难都预先一一料到，同时也不可能把时刻在增长着的有利因素全部看清。主要的问题是不迁就困难，不在困难面前退却；锐敏地发现有利因素，发展有利因素，去克服困难，战胜困难。
    矛和盾是互相依存的，困难和克服困难的可能性是同时存在的。正确的态度不是一遇到困难就降低指标，而是不断地寻找和创造克服困难的措施与条件，保证跃进指标的实现！
