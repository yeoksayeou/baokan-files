Tianjin, May 14th (Reported by our correspondent Meng Fan): Following the implementation of cadre participation in manual labor, the Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory has further mobilized workers to participate in management and has correspondingly changed its organizational structure and regulations. This has effectively overcome the remnants of the old relations of production, resulting in a new situation where "everyone is a producer and everyone is a manager."

Although the Dagong Dyeing Factory is a small factory with only 193 workers, its management structure was very large. Under the leadership of the factory director, the five sections and three offices had 59 management personnel who controlled everything in the factory. At the same time, they emphasized mutual restriction between departments, and various rules and regulations were numerous and complex. As a result, conflicts constantly occurred between departments, and they shirked responsibility when things happened, preventing problems in the workshops from being resolved quickly.

During the "Double Anti" movement, employees posted over 30,000 big-character posters, most of which criticized the bureaucracy of the cadres and the chaotic and buck-passing phenomena in the management work of the departments. Based on the opinions of the masses, the factory leadership reduced the management structure to one section and three offices, leaving 23 management cadres, with the rest being sent to the workshops to participate in labor or transferred to support other factories. However, because the management authority and regulations were not changed, the effect was not very significant. Especially after the leading cadres implemented participation in manual labor, there was no leadership in the department work. The factory director worked in the workshop during the day and had to work overtime at night to handle business, resulting in long working hours. In this situation, the factory leadership felt that it was necessary to reform some rules and regulations and delegate some management power to the workshops.

At the end of April, after learning about the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province, their ideological understanding became clearer, and they immediately took action. After discussions by all the employees, they focused on workers participating in the management work of the group under the leadership of the workshop administration, and correspondingly changed the organizational structure and regulations. Within the workshop, in accordance with the characteristics of three-shift production, rotating shift directors were appointed, and technical cadres were sent to the workshop to closely integrate technical work and production management work. Under the leadership of the rotating shift director, workers in each production group elected "Five Great Personnel" to be responsible for attendance, technology, safety, storage, and rationalization proposals for their group, forming a mass management network. In order to meet the needs of production, the factory-level leaders also delegated some management authority to the workshops and groups. In terms of finance, based on past actual expenditures, the rotating shift director could approve 150 yuan per month, and the group leader could approve 7.5 to 50 yuan. The small items used by the group were also purchased by the workers themselves. In terms of personnel, the rotating shift director and the group leader could transfer all personnel in their shift or group and had the right to approve employee leave. In terms of production scheduling, the factory simplified the past procedures for issuing production plans at each level and changed it to direct issuance from the factory level to the group. The production quota was controlled by the group, and the change of operation methods was changed from approval by the factory director to approval by the technician and the rotating shift director. In this way, 150 out of the factory's 197 systems and forms were streamlined or changed.

The participation of workers in management, the delegation of authority, and the reform of some rules and regulations made it necessary to further streamline the department structure. After research by all cadres, it was determined that the original one section and three offices would be abolished, and a production office under the leadership of the factory director would be established, leaving five management personnel. Together with the factory director, the branch secretary, and the chairman of the trade union, there were a total of eight full-time cadres. The remaining management personnel were transferred to the workshop to strengthen the leadership of the shifts and groups or to participate in labor. After the organizational structure was streamlined, the factory's leading cadres continued to go to the workshop to participate in manual labor on a regular basis, and the five management cadres also spent half a day each week participating in labor.

Although the Dagong Dyeing Factory has only been reforming enterprise management for a week, the communist spirit of workers being masters, caring for the collective, and actively cooperating has already been brought into play. Workers are conscientious and responsible for their respective businesses, and the daily production records are accurate and timely. All eight types of comprehensive reports of the factory can be completed on time or ahead of schedule. In the past few days, the workers' attendance rate has reached 100%. After worker Ge Longhai was elected as the group's attendance clerk, he arrived early and left late every day. One morning, when he was going to work and crossing the railway, he was delayed because a train was passing. After the train passed, he ran all the way to the factory. When someone asked him, he said: "I am the attendance clerk, how can I tell others if I am late." In management work, efficiency has also been improved due to the simplification of procedures. For example, the material verification work in the workshop was changed from eight procedures to one procedure, and what used to take two days to complete now takes more than an hour.

### 学庆华  赶庆华  工人要当家  天津大功染厂一片共产主义气氛

　　学庆华  赶庆华  工人要当家
　　天津大功染厂一片共产主义气氛
    本报天津14日电　记者孟帆报道：天津大功染厂在领导干部实行跟班劳动的基础上，又进一步发动工人参加管理，并且相应地改变组织机构和规章制度，有效地克服了旧的生产关系的残余，出现了“人人是生产者、个个是管理者”的新局面。
    大功染厂虽然是个仅有一百九十三名工人的小厂，管理机构却很庞大。在厂长领导下的五股三室有五十九名管理人员，他们把工厂里的大小事情都抓在手里。同时，他们又强调科室互相制约，各种规章制度名目繁多，手续复杂。因此，在各科室之间不断发生矛盾，遇事互相扯皮、推诿，使车间发生的问题不能迅速解决。
    在“双反”运动中，职工贴出约三万多张大字报，绝大部分是批评干部的官气和科室管理工作的混乱、扯皮现象的。根据群众意见，工厂领导方面紧缩管理机构为一股三室，留下二十三名管理干部，其余下放车间参加劳动或外调支援其他工厂。但是由于管理权限和规章制度没有改变，得到的效果不很显著。特别是在领导干部实行跟班劳动以后，科室工作无人领导。白天厂长下车间劳动，晚上还得加班处理业务，工作时间很长。在这种情况下，工厂领导方面感到必须改革一些规章制度，把部分管理权下放到车间。
    4月底，他们知道了黑龙江省庆华工具厂的经验，思想认识更加明确了，就立即行动起来。经过全厂职工讨论，以工人在车间行政的领导下参加小组的管理工作为中心，相应地改变了组织机构和规章制度。在车间内按照三班生产的特点，任命了轮班主任，把技术干部下放到车间，使技术工作和生产管理工作紧密地结合起来。在轮班主任的领导下，各生产小组的工人选出“五大员”，分别担任本小组的考勤、技术、安全、保管、合理化建议等工作，形成了群众性的管理工作网。为了适应生产的需要，厂级领导干部把部分管理权限也下放给车间和小组。在财务方面，根据过去的实际开支，轮班主任每月可以批准一百五十元，小组长可以批准七元五角到五十元。小组使用的零星用品，也由工人自行购置。在人事方面，轮班主任和小组长可以调动本班或本组的所有人员，并有权批准职工假期。在生产调度方面，工厂简化了过去层层下达生产计划的手续，改由厂级直接下达到小组。生产定额由小组掌握，操作方法的改变由厂长批准改为由技师和轮班主任批准。这样，就把本厂一百九十七种制度和表报，精简或改变了一百五十种。
    工人参加管理、权限下放以及部分规章制度的改革，使科室机构有进一步紧缩的必要。经过全体干部研究以后，确定原有的一股三室全部取消，另成立一个在厂长领导下的生产办公室，留下五个管理人员，连同厂长、支部书记、工会主席共有八个脱产干部。其余管理人员抽调到车间加强班、组的领导或参加劳动。组织机构紧缩以后，工厂领导干部仍定期下车间跟班劳动，五个管理干部每周也抽出半天参加劳动。
    大功染厂改革企业管理工作虽然只有一周的时间，可是工人当家做主、关心集体、主动协作的共产主义精神已经发挥起来。工人们对于自己分管的业务认真负责，每天的生产记录都十分准确、及时，全厂的八种综合报表都能按时或提前做好。几天来，工人的出勤率达到了100％。工人葛龙海被选为小组考勤员以后，每天早来晚走。一天早晨，他上班过铁路时，因为有火车开过耽误了时间。等火车开过了，他一路飞跑到厂。当别人问他的时候，他说：“我是考勤员，要是迟到了怎么去说别人。”在管理工作中，由于简化了手续，效率也提高了。如车间的核料工作由过去的八道手续改为一道手续后，两天才能办完的事，现在有一个多小时就办好了。
