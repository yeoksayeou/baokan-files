    Use the Deeds of Revolutionary Heroes to Encourage the Masses
    In newspapers and periodicals, people often use ancient figures such as Wu Song, Zhao Zilong, Huang Zhong, Zhuge Liang, and Mu Guiying to compare with the enthusiasm, wisdom, and determination of the masses in the Great Leap Forward, but rarely mention modern examples, especially since the Party led the people's revolution. Of course, I am not against using the examples of the above ancient figures to encourage the broad masses of the people, but I believe that it is more important to use the deeds of modern revolutionary heroes to educate and mobilize everyone. For example, the determination of the 25,000-li Long March, the courage of the Eighteen Warriors crossing the Dadu River, Liu Hulan's will... the examples are simply too numerous to mention. Are these inferior to the deeds of the ancients?

    多用革命英雄的事迹鼓舞群众
    在报刊上常常看到人们用武松、赵子龙、黄忠、诸葛亮、穆桂英等古人来比拟大跃进中的群众的干劲、智慧和决心，很少提到近代的特别是自党领导人民革命以来的例子。我当然不反对用以上古人的事例来鼓舞广大人民，但我认为更要用现代的革命英雄事迹来教育和鼓动大家。比如两万五千里长征的决心，十八勇士强渡大渡河的勇气，刘胡兰的意志……简直不胜枚举。这些难道比古人的事迹逊色吗？
