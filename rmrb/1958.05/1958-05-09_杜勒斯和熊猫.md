    Notes

    Dulles and the Panda
    Giant pandas grow in our country, and people of all countries, including the American people, like this precious animal. The "New York Times" reported that many zoos in major American cities have requested to purchase them from our country.
    However, this request was poured cold water on by the US State Department. Dulles's State Department believes that giant pandas are "grown in Communist China", so they cannot be allowed. Even the "New York Times" couldn't help but lament: "Giant pandas have also been drawn into the 'Cold War' foreign policy." This also shows how astonishing the degree of Dulles's war mania has developed.

    杜勒斯和熊猫
    大熊猫生长在我国，各国人民，包括美国人民在内，都喜欢这种珍兽。“纽约时报”报道说，美国许多大城市动物园都要求向我国购买。
    但是，这种要求却被美国国务院泼了冷水。杜勒斯的国务院认为，大熊猫是“生长在共产党中国的”，所以不能允许。连“纽约时报”也不禁感慨地说：“大熊猫也被卷入‘冷战’的外交政策中了”。这也说明杜勒斯的战争狂发展到了多么惊人的程度。
