    Mirror

    "Crack!" Xue Jingping was startled, looked down, and thought, "Oh no!" A small mirror was broken. Whose was it? He looked at it carefully, and his heart immediately became tense: it was Zhang Baoqing's! It would be okay if it was someone else's, but it just had to be his!
    This mirror has quite a history! It was a souvenir from Zhang Baoqing's brother. His brother was a regimental-level cadre who died in action in Korea. Zhang Baoqing treasured the small mirror like a precious gem, and he felt bad even if a little bit of mud got on it. … This was only secondary. More importantly, Xue Jingping felt that Zhang Baoqing seemed to always deliberately make things difficult for him. Just take what happened a few days ago, for example: Xue Jingping wasn't very serious about practicing shooting, and Zhang Baoqing reported it. Although Xue Jingping knew that reporting it was the right thing to do, he still felt uncomfortable in his heart. Now he blamed himself: if you're sick, just stay in bed and rest, why did you have to get up and tidy up your personal belongings! See, now there's sure to be a big argument!
    He collected the fragments and carefully put them in the wooden box where he usually kept his needles and thread, and then tidied up his personal belongings again. The comrades would be back in a little while.
    "No matter what, I have to explain it to him first!" he thought as he walked back from fetching water.
    "Hey? Where's my mirror?" It was Zhang Baoqing shouting.
    "Oh no! It's broken! It's here!"
    "Who's so wicked?" Zhang Baoqing's voice was rough, obviously already angry.
    A real man takes responsibility for his actions. Xue Jingping immediately quickened his pace and shouted from outside, "I broke it!" He stepped into the doorway, straddling the threshold, and said impatiently, "I broke it, I wasn't paying attention!"
    The squad leader, afraid of making things worse, quickly came over to mediate. Xue Jingping explained how he broke the mirror. After he finished speaking, he said bluntly:
  "I broke it, I'll pay for it! What's so great about a small mirror!" These weren't his true feelings, but he stubbornly refused to admit defeat and had to say it. Because of his inner shame, he glanced at Zhang Baoqing, blushed, and lowered his head.
    A moment of silence. Zhang Baoqing looked around, as if he had discovered something, and hurried over, saying excitedly, "No, Jingping, it's not your fault. You're sick and still insisted on tidying up your personal belongings. My heart was too narrow, over a small mirror..." As he spoke, he suddenly grabbed Xue Jingping's hand, holding it tightly, "Forgive me, my attitude just now was wrong."
    "I, this—" Xue Jingping really hadn't expected this. He almost couldn't believe it was true. When he understood, shame and sadness filled his heart, and he muttered that he couldn't say anything.
    They reconciled. Xue Jingping felt that he broke one mirror, but he got another mirror in return, and this mirror illuminated his heart.

    “啪！”薛景平吓了一跳，低头一看，糟了！一个小镜子摔碎了。是谁的？他仔细看了一下，心立刻紧张起来：是张宝庆的！要是别人的还好说，偏偏是他！
    提起这个镜子，可有来历呢！这是张宝庆他哥哥的纪念品。他哥哥是个团级干部，在朝鲜作战时牺牲了。张宝庆把小镜子看的像宝贝一样，上面沾点泥他都心疼。……这还是次要的，更重要的是，薛景平觉得张宝庆好像总故意跟他为难。就拿前几天的事说吧，薛景平练习射击不大认真，张宝庆就汇报了。薛景平虽然知道汇报是对的，可是心里总觉着怪不舒服。现在他怨自己：生了病，就好好躺在床上休息吧，干么非起来整理内务不可呢！瞧吧，准是一场好吵！
    他把碎片收起来，小心地装进了自己平时放针线的木盒里，然后又收拾内务。再过一会儿同志们就回来了。
    “不管怎么样，我得先和他说明白！”在打水回来的路上，他一边走一边想。
    “哎？我的镜子呢？”是张宝庆在嚷。
    “哎呀！打坏了！在这儿哪！”
    “谁这么缺德？”张宝庆的声音很粗，显然已经冒火了。
    好汉做事好汉当，薛景平立刻加快了脚步，在外面喊：“是我打的！”他一脚迈到门里，跨在门槛上，没好气地说：“我打的，我没注意！”
    班长怕把事情闹大了，便赶快过来调解，薛景平就把打镜子的经过说了一遍。说完，他直统统地说：
  “我打的我赔！一个小镜子有什么了不起！”这不是他的心里话，可是嘴上硬不愿意服软，非这么说不可。由于内心的惭愧，他看了张宝庆一眼，红着脸低下了头。
    一阵沉默。张宝庆四下里看了看，好像发现了什么，便急忙走过来，激动地说：“不，景平，不怨你，你有病还坚持整理内务。我的心太狭了，为了一个小镜子……”说着，他猛地抓住薛景平的手，紧紧地握着，“你原谅我吧，我刚才的态度不对。”
    “我，这——”薛景平真没料到，他几乎不敢相信这是真的，等他明白过来，惭愧、难过塞满了心头，他喃喃地什么也说不出。
    他们和好了。薛景平觉得，他打了一面镜子，却又得到了一面镜子，这面镜子照亮了自己的心。
