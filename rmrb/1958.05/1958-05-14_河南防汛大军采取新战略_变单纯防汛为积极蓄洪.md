Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The recently concluded Henan Provincial Flood Control Work Conference called on all regions to take early action and strive for initiative. Before May 20th, flood control organizations at all levels and mass flood control teams should be established to prepare for flood control work in advance.

The meeting believes that this year's flood control is different from any previous year. This year is by no means simply flood control, but a continued development and improvement of water conservancy construction in the past six months, a strategic shift. In the past, flood control was only carried out on points and lines. Now, mountainous areas, hilly areas, and plain areas have a large number of water conservancy projects and soil and water conservation projects. These new projects must be managed and maintained, and flood control is also necessary. Not only should flood control be carried out along rivers, but also in mountainous areas, hilly areas, and plain areas with projects. According to these new situations and new problems, we must shift from passive defense of points and lines in the past to a comprehensive and active offensive, intercepting and storing floodwater on the spot and utilizing it. The meeting criticized the complacent and paralyzed thinking that there is no need for flood control with water storage projects.

The meeting decided that this year, point and line flood control should be combined with area flood control; each type of project should be the responsibility of a specific person. On the lines, there should be division of labor by segment; on the areas, there should be division of labor by zone. Water conservancy projects that have been completed but have not yet achieved the connection of ditches and ponds and the communication of reservoirs and canals should be systematized before the flood season to maximize the benefits of the projects. Water storage should be combined with drainage. Large reservoirs should store as much water as possible for reserve, and small and medium-sized reservoirs should control storage and discharge according to water situation forecasts. In principle, it is required to store fully and discharge in a timely manner, so that the projects can play their role without being damaged. Water conservancy projects that have not been completed should be completed before the flood season; if they cannot be completed before the flood season, they should be postponed until after the flood season; river dams built for irrigation on larger rivers should be demolished immediately. After the meeting, a major inspection of the projects should be carried out, and the problems existing in the projects should be solved before flood control.

### 河南防汛大军采取新战略  变单纯防汛为积极蓄洪

　　河南防汛大军采取新战略
　　变单纯防汛为积极蓄洪
    据新华社13日讯　最近闭幕的河南省防汛工作会议要求各地及早动手，争取主动，在5月20日以前把各级防汛组织和群众性防汛队伍建立起来，提早做好防汛工作。
    会议认为，今年的防汛和过去任何一年都不同，今年绝不是单纯的防汛，而是过去半年水利建设的继续发展和提高，是一个战略性的转变。过去的防汛，只在点线上进行。而现在，山区、丘陵区和平原区都有了大量的水利工程和保持水土的工程，这些新工程既要管理养护，也要防汛。不但沿河要防汛，有工程的山区、丘陵区和平原地区都要防汛。要根据这些新情况和新问题，由过去的点线的消极地防御，转为全面地积极地进攻，将洪水就地拦蓄起来，加以利用。会议批判了认为有了蓄水工程就不用防汛的自满麻痹思想。
    会议决定，今年要使点线防汛和面的防汛相结合；每种工程都要有专人负责。线上要分工划段，面上要分工划片。已做的水利工程，还没有达到沟塘相联、库渠相通的，要在汛期前加以系统化，以发挥工程的最大效益。蓄水要和排水相结合，大水库要尽量地蓄水备用，中小型水库要根据水情预报来掌握蓄泄。原则上要求蓄得充分，泄得适时，以达到工程起作用，不遭损坏。没有完成的水利工程，要加紧在汛期前做完；汛期前确实不能完成的，就推迟到汛期以后做；较大河流上为灌溉而打的拦河坝，要立即拆除；会议后，要对工程作一次大检查，工程中存在的问题要在防汛前就加以解决。
