Two Small Blast Furnaces in Henan Put into Production

The first iron and steel plant built in Henan Province—the Anyang Shuizhi Iron and Steel Plant—put two small blast furnaces into production on May 1.

Using blast furnaces to make iron is a first in Henan's history. Although more than 40 counties in Henan Province have iron ore, in the past there were only some native iron-smelting furnaces with low output. Now, there are already hundreds of small blast furnaces under construction and in preparation in areas with iron ore deposits in Henan. The Shuizhi Iron and Steel Plant has become a base for developing the steel industry in these areas. Before the two small blast furnaces in this plant were put into production, people from various places came to visit and entrusted the plant to train technical personnel; by the end of this year, the plant will train 800 to 1,000 technicians for various places.

The Shuizhi Iron and Steel Plant will build several more small blast furnaces this year to form an iron-smelting workshop. After all the construction projects this year are completed, this plant will produce 100,000 tons of pig iron and 60,000 tons of steel annually.

    河南两座小高炉投入生产
    河南省兴建的第一座钢铁厂——安阳水冶钢铁厂的两座小高炉1日投入生产。
    用高炉炼铁在河南历史上还是第一次。尽管河南省四十多个县有铁矿，但是以往只有一些产量不高的土法炼铁炉。现在，河南有铁矿蕴藏的地区正在兴建和筹建的小高炉已有好几百座。水冶钢铁厂成了这些地区发展钢铁工业的基地。在这个厂的两座小高炉投入生产前，各地就派人来参观，委托培养技术力量；到今年底，这个厂将为各地培养八百到一千名技工。
    水冶钢铁厂今年将再建设几座小高炉，组成炼铁车间。今年的建设工程全部完工以后，这个厂将年产生铁十万吨，钢六万吨。
