The “Communist International” collective farm in Michurinsk District of Tambov Oblast recently opened a cultural night university. The teaching plan of this university was formulated by the farm members themselves, and the subjects taught include politics, natural sciences, literature, and art. Professors from Tambov and Michurinsk Normal Colleges, teachers from the Michurinsk Vegetable Institute, heads of the state party organization, and reporters from the All-Union Association for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge take turns giving lectures at this university every Saturday.

On the opening day of the new university, the new night university students, the members of the collective farm, listened to the first lesson on the international situation.

Soviet peasants are widely known for their singing and dancing. With the prosperity of the Soviet rural economy, the peasants' demand for cultural entertainment is also increasing. In the "North Star" collective farm in Uzbekistan, 300 farm members and their family members are studying music in amateur groups. The farm has set up a special sheet music library for them, where music-loving farmers can borrow all kinds of sheet music and songbooks.

There are now five such sheet music libraries in the rural areas of Tashkent Oblast.

Last year, the cash income of collective farms in Ukraine increased by 2.5 billion rubles, and the public accumulation fund of the farms increased by more than 22%. Therefore, the collective farms in Ukraine have more favorable conditions to further improve the cultural life of the peasants. This year, Ukraine will build 1,600 rural clubs according to standard designs. Each club will have a theater, a library, a reading room, and activity rooms for various amateur groups.

    苏联农庄开办夜大学  建设成千标准俱乐部
    唐波夫州米丘林区的“共产国际”集体农庄最近开办了一所文化夜大学。这所大学的教学计划是庄员们自己制定的，教学的科目有政治、自然科学、文学和艺术。唐波夫和米丘林师范学院的教授、米丘林蔬菜学院的教师、州党组织的负责人以及全苏政治和科学知识普及协会的报告员，每个星期六轮流到这个大学来讲课。
    新大学开学的那一天，新的夜大学学生，集体农庄的庄员们，听了关于国际形势的第一课。
    苏联广大农民都能歌善舞。随着苏联农村经济的繁荣，农民对文化娱乐的要求也日益提高。在乌兹别克斯坦的“北极星”集体农庄，有三百个庄员和他们的家庭成员都在业余小组学习音乐。农庄为他们专门设立了一个乐谱图书馆，爱好音乐的农民可以在这里借到各种乐谱和歌本。
    这样的乐谱图书馆在塔什干州的农村里现在也有五个。
    去年，乌克兰集体农庄的现金收入增加了二十五亿卢布，农庄的公积金增加了22％以上。因此，乌克兰的农庄有了更优越的条件来进一步改善农民的文化生活。今年乌克兰将按标准设计盖一千六百个农村俱乐部。每个俱乐部里都有剧场、图书馆、阅览室和各种业余小组的活动室。（附图片）
