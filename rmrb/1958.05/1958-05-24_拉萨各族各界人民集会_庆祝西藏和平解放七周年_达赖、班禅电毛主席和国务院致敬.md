Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 23rd: Today is the seventh anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. More than 800 people from various organizations, groups, and ethnic groups in Lhasa held a grand celebration at the Lhasa Auditorium.

The central and Tibetan local representatives who participated in the negotiations on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and are now in Lhasa were invited to attend the celebration.

General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, and Zhang Guohua, leading comrade of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tibet Military Region, attended the meeting to congratulate the people of Tibet.

Also participating in the celebration were senior officials of the Tibetan local government, Kahlons and Tsongdupon, and Tibetan personnel from the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee and the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee in Lhasa.

The Tibetan youth and women who participated in the celebration wore neat and bright national costumes. Representatives of the religious community—elderly Living Buddhas and Khenpos—wore their kasayas.

Seven years ago today, the two central negotiators and the five Tibetan local negotiators who participated in the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in Beijing accepted "Hada" offerings from representatives of all sectors and flowers from Young Pioneers. At this time, the venue resounded with stormy applause, thanking them for doing a historically significant thing for the motherland and the people of Tibet.

General Zhang Jingwu spoke at the meeting, talking about the remarkable achievements in implementing the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet over the past seven years and the main tasks for the future. General Zhang Jingwu said that we must continue to strengthen patriotic education, raise political awareness, strengthen national unity, consolidate the unity of the motherland, resolutely fight against imperialism and a small handful of reactionary elements who betray the motherland and the interests of the Tibetan people, and gradually develop Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and educational construction.

Apei Awang Jinmei, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, used the specific facts of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region to talk about the many active measures taken by the central government to help the Tibetan people realize national regional autonomy and enable the Tibetan people to be masters of their own affairs.

Sokang Wangqing Gele, representative of the Tibetan local government, extended auspicious and satisfactory congratulations to the celebration. On behalf of the Tibetan local government, he thanked the central government for helping Tibet achieve great construction achievements over the past seven years. He said: "In the future, in order to get Tibet out of its backwardness and enter a socialist society with the people of the motherland, please continue to provide assistance and guidance like the advanced Han elder brother."

Those who spoke at the celebration also included Tibetan local negotiation representative Tubdan Danda, Wangde, deputy director of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee's Lhasa Office, and Pabala, honorary director of the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee. They unanimously praised the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet for bringing freedom and happiness to the Tibetan people, and expressed their determination to work hard for the continued and complete implementation of the agreement.

After the meeting, a celebration banquet was held. People offered toasts to the negotiation representatives.

Major towns in Tibet, such as Xigaze, Qamdo, Gyantse, and Heihe, also held celebrations today.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 23rd: Telegrams of respect from the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni to Chairman Mao and the State Council. The full text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao and the State Council:

On the occasion of the grand celebrations in major cities and towns in Tibet to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, I would like to extend my highest respect to you and the State Council on behalf of all the monks and lay people of Tibet.

Over the past seven years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, you, and the State Council, thanks to the active implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement by the People's Liberation Army and working personnel stationed in Tibet, as well as the monks and lay people of Tibet, Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings have achieved considerable success. In the future, on this basis, we must further oppose local nationalism and strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality, and work together to gradually and thoroughly implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

I respectfully wish respected Chairman Mao good health.
                                                                                                 Dalai Lama May 23, 1958

Respected Chairman Mao and the State Council:

On the happy occasion of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," with extremely excited and joyful feelings, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to the great savior of all ethnic groups - the Communist Party, you, and the State Council - on behalf of the monks and lay people of Tibet.

Over the past seven years, under the wise leadership and kind education of the Party and you, the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" is being gradually implemented, the unity within Tibet and between the Han and Tibetan peoples has been increasingly consolidated, the people's anti-imperialist and patriotic enthusiasm has also been increasing, and all aspects of work in the Tibet region have made significant achievements and development. The people fully enjoy the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief and happily build their homeland. Now, Han and Tibetan cadres, like the people of the whole country, are in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, with unparalleled revolutionary drive, comparing work, comparing learning, comparing labor, and comparing ideological progress. This year, Tibet's spring rain was timely, and the farmers have completed sowing. We will have another bumper harvest this autumn. Farmers generally reflect that this is the happiness brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so they are praying for you day and night, and some are even chanting longevity scriptures to pray for your longevity.

Chairman Mao! We will always closely unite around you, further consolidate unity, strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces, resolutely oppose the conspiracies and activities of pro-imperialist splittists and local nationalists, and resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland; in line with the principle of diligence and thrift in building the country, do a good job in various tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, create conditions for future reforms, and strive for the early establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
