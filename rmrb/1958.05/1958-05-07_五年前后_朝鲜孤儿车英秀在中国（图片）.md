    Five Years On
    Korean Orphan Cha Yingxiu in China
    The aggressive cannons of American imperialism took the lives of Korean child Cha Yingxiu’s parents. In the autumn of 1952, Cha Yingxiu came to study at the Wanjingtai Primary School in Jilin City, China, and received care and love from the Chinese people.
    Five years have passed again. How is Cha Yingxiu living today, five years later?
    This photo was taken in May 1953. Cha Yingxiu (right) is playing in Beishan with Chinese children from the Third District Central Complete Primary School in Jilin City.

    五年前后
    朝鲜孤儿车英秀在中国
    美帝国主义的侵略炮火夺去了朝鲜儿童车英秀的双亲。1952年秋天，车英秀来到我国吉林市万景台初等学院学习，受到我国人民的关怀和爱护。
    时光又流转了五年，五年后的今天，车英秀生活得怎样呢？
    这张照片是在1953年5月拍的。车英秀（右）正和吉林市第三区中心完小的中国儿童到北山去玩。
