Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th. The broad masses and medical personnel in schistosomiasis-prevalent areas of Anhui Province have displayed revolutionary vigor, making great achievements in a comprehensive encirclement and suppression of schistosomiasis by simultaneously advancing on snail eradication, treatment, and feces and water source management. According to statistics from the recent three months, Anhui Province has basically eliminated snails in eleven counties and cities and one hundred and eighty-nine townships, with a snail eradication area of more than 250 million square meters; treated more than 80,000 patients; and feces management has reached 96.4% of the households that should be managed.

Since the beginning of spring this year, under the command of Party and government leaders at all levels, schistosomiasis prevention and control work, combined with water conservancy construction and the elimination of the four pests, has mobilized 10,092,000 person-times to participate in snail eradication. In some places, the masses stayed at the construction sites with their luggage and tools, ensuring that they would move on to another area only after eradicating snails in the current one, and put forward the slogan "We will not withdraw until we eradicate all the snails." In the snail eradication work, most places have adopted the methods of digging new ditches, filling old ditches, and deepening and widening ditches that cannot be filled, and reinforcing them with earth, which has not only thoroughly eradicated snails but also facilitated water conservancy irrigation. In terms of treatment, various places have generally adopted the measure of mobile teams stationed in communes to promote the three-day treatment method, which has greatly improved work efficiency. Originally, each doctor could only be responsible for twenty to twenty-five patients, but now, in some places, each doctor has reached the point of treating fifty patients, and each nurse is caring for one hundred patients. Schistosomiasis-prevalent areas are vigorously establishing public toilets; boats are also equipped with chamber pots to ensure that feces are disposed of on land. Some places have also built new wells and washing pools to strengthen water source management. Currently, more than 660,000 households in the disease areas have access to safe water. In various places, 150,000 people have taken measures such as wearing leggings and cloth socks when going into the water for protection. When the masses in Zhide County go to the lake to cut grass, everyone has protective tools, preventing schistosomiasis infection.

　　灭螺、治疗、粪便和水源管理齐头并进
　　安徽全面围剿血吸虫病
    新华社合肥14日电　安徽省血吸虫病流行地区的广大群众和医务人员拿出革命干劲，在灭螺、治疗、粪便和水源管理等的工作上齐头并进，向血吸虫病全面大围剿，获得很大成绩。据最近三个多月的统计，安徽省已在十一个县、市和一百八十九个乡基本上消灭了钉螺，灭螺面积达二亿五千多平方公尺；治疗患者八万多人；粪便管理已达到应管户的96.4％。
    今年入春以来，血吸虫病防治工作在各级党政负责人指挥下，结合兴修水利和除四害，先后发动一千零九十二万人次参加灭螺。有些地方的群众带着行李和工具，驻在工地上，做到灭光一块再移一块，并提出“不灭光钉螺，决不收兵”。在灭螺工作中，绝大多数地方都是采取了开新沟、填旧沟和对不能填的沟挖深开宽、培土加固的办法，灭螺既彻底，又利于水利灌溉。在治疗工作方面，各地普遍采取了巡回驻社推广三日疗法的措施，工作效率大为提高。原来每个医生只能负责二十至二十五个病人，现在，有的地方每个医生已达到治疗五十个病人，一个护士护理一百个病人。血吸虫病流行地区大力建立公共厕所；船上也建立便桶，做到上岸倒粪。有的地方还新建了水井、洗涤池等，加强水源管理，病区目前做到安全用水的已有六十六万多户。各地已有十五万人做到下水打绑腿，穿布袜等办法进行防护，至德县群众下湖打草时，每人都有防护工具，杜绝了血吸虫病的感染。
