    Chen Shufang on the Banks of the Jialing River
    On May 7th, at the Chaotianmen Wharf, where the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers converge, a small team carrying a red flag emblazoned with "Street Performance Team" attracted hundreds and thousands of dockworkers and pedestrians coming and going on the high slopes along the river. This was the third street performance for the citizens by famous Sichuan opera actors Chen Shufang, Zeng Ronghua, and others. Chen Shufang performed a segment from "The Palace of Eternal Life" this time. (Attached image)

    陈书舫在嘉陵江畔
    5月7日在长江和嘉陵江合流处的朝天门码头，一支打着“街头演出队”红旗的小队伍吸引住了江边的成百成千个码头工人和临江高坡上来往的行人。这是川剧名演员陈书舫、曾荣华等为市民作第三次街头演出。陈书舫这次演出了“长生殿”中的一段。（附图片）
