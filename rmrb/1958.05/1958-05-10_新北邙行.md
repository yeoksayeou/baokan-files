    A New Trip to Northern Mang Mountain
    Zhao Puchu
    March 26, 1958, I climbed Northern Mang Mountain in Luoyang. The masses were opening canals to divert the Luo River up the mountain for irrigation.
    I come to Northern Mang Mountain, but see no ancient tombs. (Note)
    Why is the yellow earth piled so high? It's said to be the road for opening the canal.
    The fields stretch out endlessly, with deep ditches crisscrossing.
    Hoes and shovels dance high and low, the shouting like the roar of the tide.
    Waiting to see on April 1st, the Luo River will take high strides,
    The clear stream will come rolling in, not stopping from dawn till dusk.
    Once a drought-ridden barren hill, now a paddy rice granary,
    Who knew the mountains and rivers could change with just a snap of the fingers?
    Don't plant white poplars, plant millions of peach trees,
    Raise a glass to invite the bright moon, the bright moon shines on the ditches,
    Every ditch reflects rosy faces, every canal leaps with green fish,
    Every village celebrates the harvest, every household spreads joyous cheers.
    Tell the people underground, they should be happy for all eternity.
    (Note) Northern Mang Mountain was a famous ancient burial ground, with many tombs from the Han and Wei dynasties, all now sunk underground.

    新北邙行
    赵朴初
    一九五八年三月二十六日登洛阳北邙，群众方开渠道，引洛水上山溉田。
    我来北邙山，不见古人墓。（注）
    黄土何累累？云是开渠路。
    田畴望无尽，深沟纵横布。
    锄锸高下舞，邪许如潮怒。
    待看四月一，洛水迈高步，
    清流来滚滚，不舍旦与暮。
    昔为旱云冈，今为水稻库，
    谁知山川改，只在一指顾？
    莫种白杨树，种桃千万株，
    举杯邀明月，明月照沟渠，
    沟沟映红颜，渠渠跃青鱼，
    村村庆丰收，户户传欢呼。
    寄语地下人，万古应自娱。
    （注）北邙山为古代著名墓地，汉魏坟墓甚多，均已沉入地下。
