　　Why Must You Drink Milk When Eating Sesame Cakes?
    One day in early May, I went to the No. 1 Canteen in Taonan County to eat. As soon as I entered, I saw a large plate of sesame cakes displayed in the window and wanted to buy a few. Unexpectedly, the waiter standing inside the counter said, "We don't sell them individually. If you want to eat them, you must buy a set, which is two cups of milk and four sesame cakes, totaling 38 cents." I said I wasn't used to drinking milk, could I just buy the sesame cakes? The waiter shook his head and said, "This is the rule. We don't sell sesame cakes without milk." I asked again, "What about just one cup of milk?" The waiter said that wasn't possible either; it had to be two cups.
    No matter how I requested, the waiter insisted on not selling the sesame cakes and milk separately, so I had to switch to plain rice. But the waiter then said, "We don't sell plain rice alone either; you must order a stir-fried dish with a bowl of rice." Seeing the waiter making things so difficult for me, I simply didn't eat. On the way home, I couldn't figure it out. Why do restaurants have to set so many rules and regulations for customers? Why do they have to make things so difficult for people?

　　为什么吃烧饼一定要喝牛奶
    5月上旬的一天中午，我去洮南县第一食堂吃饭，一进屋看见橱窗里摆满一大盘烧饼，想买几个来吃。不料站在柜台里边的服务员却说：“零买不卖，要吃必须吃一套，一套就是两杯牛奶和四个烧饼，共三角八分。”我说我不习惯喝牛奶，光吃烧饼行不行？服务员摇摇头说：“这是制度，不喝牛奶就不卖烧饼。”我又问：“那么少喝一杯呢？”服务员也说不行，必须喝两杯。
    不管我怎样的要求，服务员始终坚持烧饼和牛奶不分开卖，我只好改吃白饭。但服务员又说：“光吃白饭也不卖，必须一碗饭配一个炒菜才卖。”看到服务员这样为难我，索性就不吃了。在回家的路上，我百思不解，为什么饭馆要给顾客制定这么多的清规戒律，干吗要这样的为难人呢？
