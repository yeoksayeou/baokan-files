Xinhua News Agency, May 14th, Caracas Dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon arrived in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela—the last stop of his eight-nation tour of South America—on the 13th, where he encountered the most intense anti-American mass demonstrations of his trip.

　　As Nixon disembarked from the plane at Caracas airport, the first thing he saw was a large white flag hanging at the airport, which read: “Goodbye, Nixon, we won’t miss you.”

　　As Nixon, accompanied by Venezuelan Foreign Minister García and other officials, walked towards his car, large numbers of demonstrators lined the street, spitting at Nixon and his entourage. The spit landed directly on Nixon. Angry crowds shouted slogans such as "Nixon, go home!" "No, Nixon! We don't want you!" They held up signs saying "We cannot forget Guatemala," "Latin America does not need American interference," and waved their fists, pushing towards Nixon's car. A large number of police guarding the car could not stop the demonstrators. Nixon himself had to use great effort to push through the crowd and get into the car.

　　After Nixon got into the car, sticks, stones, rotten fruit, eggs, garbage, etc. flew at his car from all directions. The car windows were smashed to pieces. Broken glass hit Nixon and cut his translator's mouth. The car was almost covered in spit, and the eggs and rotten fruit thrown by the people were stuck on the top and sides of the car. The American flag on the car was also torn off.

　　When Mrs. Nixon got into the car, a young man grabbed her and shouted: "What about the black children in Little Rock (an American city where outrageous persecution of black people occurred last year)?" Another black man shouted at Nixon: "Democracy! You don't like the blacks there!"

　　The police fired tear gas to rescue Nixon from the siege.

　　Nixon abandoned his plan to lay a wreath at the tomb of Venezuelan national hero Simón Bolívar at the Pantheon and hurriedly took refuge in the local American embassy. Because there were also about four thousand demonstrators waiting for him there.

　　At the same time, about a thousand people demonstrated around the Venezuelan presidential palace to protest Nixon's visit to Venezuela. The head of the Venezuelan military government, Larrazábal, spoke to the crowd from the balcony, asking them to remain calm, and he promised to personally take action on the outstanding issues between Venezuela and the United States.

　　Nixon cancelled all the social events scheduled for the two-day visit. He said at the American embassy, "I expect to arrive safely in Washington by ten o'clock the day after tomorrow morning."

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 14th, Washington Dispatch: After the news of U.S. Vice President Nixon being insulted by angry crowds in the capital of Venezuela, Caracas, on the 13th, reached Washington, the U.S. government was enraged and took threatening measures to put pressure on Venezuela.

　　According to reports, U.S. President Eisenhower was so angry after receiving the report that he "hit the roof" and immediately ordered U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to summon the Venezuelan Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Tachetti, demanding that the Venezuelan government "take all possible measures to protect Nixon" from further attacks. Dulles also threatened that if Venezuela "lacks the determination and strength" to carry out this task, the United States hopes to be notified immediately.

　　On the same evening, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would airlift two paratrooper companies and two Marine companies to certain U.S. bases in the Caribbean region, ready to be deployed at any time to "help" the Venezuelan government suppress the anti-American demonstrations there. White House spokesman Hagerty told reporters that the decision to send troops was approved by Eisenhower. He said that if the Venezuelan government requests assistance, these troops can work with the Venezuelan government to jointly "suppress the riots."

　　At the same time, some Democratic members of the U.S. Congress criticized the government's practice of dispatching troops near Venezuela to show "power." Senate Armed Services Committee members Kefauver and Jackson denounced the move as "unfortunate." Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Humphrey said, "I don't think this public demonstration of moving troops to that area will enhance our (American) prestige." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Russell told reporters: The anti-American demonstrations in Caracas "show the failure of our current foreign policy based on dollar aid."

　　委内瑞拉爆发反美大示威
　　尼克松在加拉加斯又挨揍
　　美国政府老羞成怒竟采取武力威胁
    新华社14日讯　加拉加斯消息：美国副总统尼克松13日到达委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯——他的南美八国之行的最后一站时，遇到了他这次旅行访问中最激烈的一次群众反美示威。
    尼克松在加拉加斯机场下了飞机以后，第一眼看到的就是悬挂在机场上的一面大白旗，上面写着：“再见，尼克松，我们不留你。”
    当尼克松在委内瑞拉外交部长加西亚等官员陪同下走向他的汽车时，大批示威者就夹道向尼克松一行吐唾沫，唾沫一直落到尼克松身上。愤怒的群众高呼“尼克松，滚回去！”“不，尼克松！我们不要你！”等口号，高举写着“我们忘记不了危地马拉”、“拉丁美洲不需要美国来干涉”等等的标语牌，挥舞着拳头，向尼克松的汽车挤去。守卫在汽车旁边的大批警察拦阻不住示威者，尼克松本人不得不用了很大气力推开人群钻进汽车去。
    在尼克松坐上汽车以后，棍棒、石子、烂水果、鸡蛋、垃圾等从四面八方飞向他的汽车，汽车上的玻璃窗全被打得粉碎。碎玻璃打中了尼克松，割碎了他的翻译的嘴巴。汽车四周几乎满是唾沫，人们扔的鸡蛋和烂水果都粘在汽车的顶上和四周。车上的美国国旗也被撕掉。
    当尼克松夫人上汽车时，一个青年抓住她，大喊道：“小石城（去年曾发生猖狂的迫害黑人事件的美国城市）的黑孩子怎么样了？”另一个黑人向尼克松高呼：“民主！你不喜欢那里的黑人！”
    警察施放了催泪瓦斯弹，才把尼克松救出重围。
    尼克松放弃了到伟人祠去向委内瑞拉民族英雄西蒙·博利瓦陵墓献花圈的计划，而匆忙躲入了当地美国大使馆。因为在那里也有大约四千人的示威者在等待他。
    与此同时，有大约一千个人在委内瑞拉总统府四周示威，抗议尼克松来委内瑞拉访问。委内瑞拉军政府首脑拉腊萨巴耳在阳台上向群众讲话，要求群众保持镇静，他保证亲自就委内瑞拉和美国之间悬而未决的问题采取行动。
    尼克松取消了预定的两天访问中要进行的一切社交节目，他在美国大使馆里表示说，“我期望在后天上午十时安全地到达华盛顿”。
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统尼克松13日在委内瑞拉的首都加拉加斯群众激烈的反美示威中遭到辱骂的消息传到华盛顿以后，美国政府老羞成怒，并且采取了威胁性的措施，对委内瑞拉施加压力。
    据报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔在接到报告后气得“暴跳如雷”，并且立刻命令美国国务卿杜勒斯召见了委内瑞拉驻美国代办塔切蒂，要求委内瑞拉政府“采取一切可能的措施来保护尼克松”不再受到攻击。杜勒斯还威胁说：如果委内瑞拉“缺乏决心和力量”去执行这项任务，美国希望立刻得到通知。
    同一天晚间，美国国防部宣布把两连伞兵和两连海军陆战队空运到加勒比地区的某些美国基地，准备随时出动，来“帮助”委内瑞拉政府镇压那里的反美示威。白宫发言人哈格蒂对记者说，派遣军队的决定是艾森豪威尔批准的。他说，如果委内瑞拉政府要求援助，这些军队就可以同委内瑞拉政府一起共同“镇压暴乱”。
    同时，美国国会的一些民主党议员抨击政府调遣军队到委内瑞拉附近显示“威力”的做法。参议院军事委员会委员克弗维尔和杰克逊指责这个行动是“不幸的”。参议院外交委员会委员汉弗莱说，“我并不认为这种调动军队到那个地区的公开示威会提高我们（美国）的威信”。参议院军事委员会主席鲁塞尔对记者说：加拉加斯的反美示威“表明我们以美元援助为基础的目前外交政策的失败”。
