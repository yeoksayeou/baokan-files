Wuhan, May 28th (by our reporter Feng Jian) - Three thousand production and construction workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, in order to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, have put forward a new and ambitious plan: striving to double the construction speed of Wuhan Iron and Steel and halve the construction investment; to build this large-scale steel base more, faster, better, and more economically.

The builders have decided that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, they will not only complete the first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel project according to the state plan, but also greatly increase production capacity under the condition of basically not increasing the original investment.

Since May this year, the workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel and the workers of Anshan and Wuhan Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institutes, who designed Wuhan Iron and Steel, have proposed hundreds of measures and plans that they had never thought of or dared to think of in the past, requesting to save investment in the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel and speed up the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel. These measures mainly include: adopting cheaper building structures and building materials without reducing the quality and effectiveness of buildings; increasing the proportion of daily output equipment from 60% to 80%, and reducing and postponing some non-urgent projects; building living facilities in a simple and economical way, and so on. Most of these measures have been implemented one after another. For example, after discussion by the employees of the coking chemical plant, the first phase of the project alone can reduce the state investment by about one-third.

Since this spring, the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel has been in an inspiring leap forward situation; this leap is a continuation and new development of the continuous leaps forward since this year. In January this year, according to the general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, the builders advanced the date of iron tapping from No. 1 blast furnace from the first half of 1959 to National Day 1958. In the months since then, the project has progressed extremely rapidly; and the quality of the project has been guaranteed. When the builders were building the furnace body of No. 1 coke oven, installing the equipment of No. 1 coke oven, and building the chimney of the sintering plant, they created the highest construction speed record in China.

The builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel entered the construction site in the autumn of 1955, and began the construction of major system projects in April 1957. So far, they have initially obtained the basic experience of building a large-scale steel base and cultivated and strengthened a strong construction team. Now the builders are seizing the opportunity to carry out large-scale rectification and reform, and thoroughly destroy the old and establish the new, strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, mobilize the masses of workers to carry out technical and cultural revolutions, and further implement the general line of socialist construction.

    武钢三万职工提出豪迈计划
    速度快一倍　投资减一半
    本报武汉28日电　记者冯健报道：武汉钢铁联合企业的三万名生产、建设职工，为了贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，已经提出了一个新的豪迈的计划：力争把武钢建设速度加快一倍，建设投资节省一半；更多、更快、更好、更省地建成这个大型钢铁基地。
    建设者们决定：在第二个五年计划期间，不仅要按照国家计划建成武钢的第一期工程，而且在基本上不增加原定投资的条件下，把生产能力大大提高。
    今年5月份以来，武钢的职工和为武钢设计的鞍山、武汉黑色冶金设计院的职工们，提出了成百上千项过去不曾想、不敢想的措施和方案，要求节约武钢建设投资，加快武钢建设速度。这些措施主要有：在不降低建筑物的质量和使用效能的原则下，采用价廉的建筑结构、建筑材料；把日产设备的比重由60％提高到80％，削减、缓建一部分不急需的工程；因陋就简地修建生活设施，等等。这些措施，大部分已经在陆续实施。如炼焦化学工厂职工经过讨论，仅第一期工程就可以比国家投资减少三分之一左右。
    今春以来，武钢建设就一直处在令人振奋鼓舞的跃进形势中；这一次飞跃则是今年以来不断跃进的继续和新发展。今年1月，建设者们就根据多快好省的方针，把一号高炉出铁的日期，从1959年上半年提前到1958年国庆日。从那时起的几个月来，工程进展得异常迅速；并且保证了工程质量，建设者们在砌筑一号炼焦炉的炉体，安装一号炼焦炉的设备和修建烧结厂的烟囱等工程时，都创造了我国建设速度的最高纪录。
    武钢建设者们从1955年秋天进入施工现场，1957年4月开始主要系统工程的建设。到目前，他们已经初步取得了建设一个大型钢铁基地的基本经验，培养壮大了一支强大的建筑队伍。现在建设者们正抓紧大整大改、大破大立，争取整风运动的全胜，发动职工群众进行技术革命和文化革命，进一步贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线。
