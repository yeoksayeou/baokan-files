In Newspapers Across the Country

    The Heroic Spirit of Youths in Xinhui
    The Southern Daily, on May 4th, published a special page dedicated to youths, filled with fighting spirit. This page showcased the exceptional heroism of youths in Xinhui County. Their battle cry was: "Go wherever there are difficulties! Every young commune member should contribute to achieving a 'thousand-jin county'!" Currently, the county has organized over 4,000 youth production teams, shock brigades, seed teams, and mountain-climbing teams, comprising over 60,000 individuals. They are charging ahead in all aspects of production. When oxen are insufficient, they replace them with human labor to plow the fields. In remote fields that are unattended, they bring their luggage and rations, living there and working hard day and night. The seed teams actively cultivate seeds, ensuring the supply of various improved varieties throughout the county.
    Backup Seedlings – “Peace Seedlings”
    In Yicheng and Gucheng Counties of the Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, a new and effective method for increasing production has been summarized. Local farmers cultivate a small plot of backup seedlings at the edge of each field when sowing winter wheat and cotton. This effectively ensures that no wheat or cotton field lacks a single seedling. This is one of their primary measures for achieving a bumper wheat harvest. The local people call these backup seedlings "Peace Seedlings." On May 6th, the Hubei Daily published a short commentary, "Let 'Peace Seedlings' Blossom Everywhere," to promote this new experience of increasing production throughout the province.
    Stink Out Departmentalism
    "One for all, all for one, care about the overall situation, cooperate to leap forward," is an extremely eye-catching slogan on the front page of the Beijing Daily on May 9th. This page published three news items related to opposing departmentalism. One reported that employees of the East Suburb Thermal Power Plant, during the rectification movement, broke down departmentalism and established an overall concept. A new atmosphere of mutual support immediately appeared on the construction site, and the progress of the project significantly accelerated. Another reported that Parties A and B at the Beijing Chemical Plant construction site trust and help each other, correctly handle contradictions, and have never had any "buck-passing" in the past two years. There was also a report that Parties A and B at the Beijing Glass Factory construction site distrusted each other, did not trust each other, and often shirked responsibilities, which caused serious harm to the work. On the same day, the newspaper published an editorial, sharply criticizing departmentalism, pointing out that "in order to build socialism quickly, well, and economically, it is necessary to thoroughly stink out departmentalism."
    "Mass Cultural Life" Special Publication
    On May 4th, the Wenhui Daily launched a new special publication: "Mass Cultural Life." In the "Launching Statement," the editors said that the purpose of establishing this special publication is to adapt to the new situation of the cultural revolution and promote the rapid progress of mass cultural work. The main target of the special publication is mass cultural work cadres, especially the vast number of grassroots cadres. Several articles published in the first issue introduced the vibrant cultural activities and experiences of units such as the Jinxing First Commune in Zaoyang, Hubei, the Yanglin Commune in Xuancheng, Anhui, and the Gaojuyuan Screw Factory in Shanghai.

专栏：在各地报纸上

    在各地报纸上
    新会青年的英雄气概
    5月4日的南方日报，刊出了一个充满着战斗精神的青年专页。在这个专页上，可以看出新会县的青年们表现得特别英勇。他们的战斗口号是：“那里有困难就到那里去！每个青年社员要为实现千斤县立功！”目前全县组织起来的青年生产队、突击队、种子队、上山队就有四千多个，六万多人。他们在生产的各个方面，冲锋陷阵、牛力不足，他们就以人代牛犁田，在无人管的远田，他们带了行李、干粮，住下来日夜苦干。种子队积极培育种子，保证了全县各种优良品种的供应。
    预备苗——太平苗
    在湖北襄阳专区的宜城县和谷城县，又总结出一项行之有效的增产新创举。当地农民在播种冬小麦和棉花的时候，在每块地头上都育了一小块预备苗。这样，就有效地保证了每块麦田和棉田不缺一棵苗。这是他们实现小麦丰产的主要措施之一。当地群众将这种预备苗誉为“太平苗”。6日湖北日报发表了“让‘太平苗’到处开花”的短评，向全省推广这项增产的新经验。
    搞臭本位主义
    “我为人人，人人为我，关心全局，协作跃进”，这是9日北京日报一版上的一个极为醒目的口号。这个版上发表了三条有关反对本位主义的消息。一条报道东郊热电站职工在整风运动中破本位主义，立整体观念，工地上立刻出现了互相支援的新气象，工程进度显著加快。另一条报道北京化工厂工地甲乙双方互相信任、互相帮助，正确处理矛盾，两年来始终没有发生“扯皮”现象。还有一条报道北京玻璃厂工地甲乙双方互相怀疑、互不信任，经常扯皮，给工作带来了严重危害。同日，报纸发表社论，对本位主义进行了尖锐的批评，指出“为了多快好省地建设社会主义，必须狠狠搞臭本位主义”。
    “群众文化生活”专刊
    4日文汇报上出现了一个新的专刊：“群众文化生活”。编者在“发刊辞”中说，创办这个专刊的目的，是适应文化革命的新形势，推动群众文化工作迅速前进。专刊的主要对象是群众文化工作干部，特别是广大基层干部。第一期上发表的几篇文章，介绍了湖北枣阳金星一社、安徽宣城扬林社和上海高聚源螺丝厂等单位生气勃勃的文化活动的情况和经验。
