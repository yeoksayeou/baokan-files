    Rural Underground Cinema
    A kind of economical and practical rural cinema has appeared in Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province. The farmers call it the "underground cinema." The construction method is to dig a basement, put a thatched roof on top, costing no more than 200 yuan, and it can accommodate more than 1,000 people. With such a screening venue, the work efficiency of rural projection teams can be increased by six to seven times. Last year, the projection teams in Shangqiu Special District screened an average of more than 200 films per team. This year, each team plans to screen more than 1,000 films. This kind of underground cinema can not only screen movies, but also perform plays, hold exhibitions, and hold mass meetings. It is a multi-purpose club and is currently being promoted in Shangqiu Special District.

    农村地下影院
    河南省商丘专区出现了一种经济实用的农村电影院，农民都叫“地下影院”。它的建筑方法是挖一个地下室，上面架起一个草屋顶，花钱不超过二百元，能容纳一千多人，有了这样的放映场所以后，农村放映队的工作效率，可以提高六、七倍以上，商丘专区的放映队去年平均一队放映二百多场电影，今年各队都计划在千场以上。这种地下影院不仅可以放映电影，而且还可以演戏，举办展览会，开群众大会，是一种多种用途的俱乐部，目前已在商丘专区推广。
