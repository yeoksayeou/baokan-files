　　Pétain's Followers
　　Those French ultra-rightists who launched the coup in Algeria have consistently called themselves "patriots," and their organization has also adopted a pleasant name, the "Committee of Public Safety." However, one of their leaders, Deléserny, couldn't help but admit what kind of person he really was at a press conference on the 21st. He respectfully referred to Pétain as the "head of state of France during the war" and lavished praise on him.
　　Pétain can be definitively judged: it was he who handed France over to Hitler with both hands; it was he, this "head of state of France during the war," who caused countless outstanding sons and daughters of France to sacrifice their precious lives! The rioters in Algiers carrying the banner of the "Committee of Public Safety" were already ineffective, but now they are praising their "head of state" Pétain, which further exposes their true colors, making it difficult to deceive people.

    贝当信徒
    在阿尔及利亚搞政变的那些法国极右翼分子一直以“爱国者”自称，他们的组织也取了“救国委员会”这样一个好听的名儿。可是，他们的领袖之一德塞里尼在21日的一次记者招待会上却情不自禁地承认了自己究竟是什么样的人物。他用尊敬的口吻把贝当叫做“法国战时的元首”，并且对他大加赞扬。
    贝当是可以盖棺论定的：是他，双手把法国献给了希特勒；是他，这位“法国战时的元首”使得法兰西无数的优秀儿女牺牲了宝贵的生命！阿尔及尔的暴乱分子扛着“救国委员会”的招牌本来就起不了什么作用，现在又赞扬起他们的“元首”贝当来了，这就更加使他们露出了狐狸尾巴，难以骗人。
