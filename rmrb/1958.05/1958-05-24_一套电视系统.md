    A Television System
    Six young teaching assistants from the Radio Department of Tsinghua University have successfully trial-produced a television system using a super-orthicon tube. Experiments have proven that its performance is very good, with the same effect as ordinary television equipment, and it can be used to transmit or receive images.
    This television system includes a super-orthicon camera, a synchronous oscillator, and amplification channels. Generally, television equipment in television stations transmits via radio waves, while this television system transmits via wired cables. After the successful trial production of this television system, it can be used by teachers and students for experiments and scientific research on television equipment, and provide experience for industrial departments to produce such television equipment.
    The trial production of this television system began last year. Soviet experts, Mr. and Mrs. Saprykin, who have now returned to their country, provided enthusiastic guidance, and relevant factories also helped solve some of the equipment problems.

    一套电视系统
    清华大学无线电系六个青年助教试制成功了一套超光电像管的电视系统。经过实验证明：它的性能很好，同普通电视设备的效果一样，可以用来发送或接受图像。
    这套电视系统包括超光电像管摄影箱、同步振荡器和放大信道等设备。一般电视台的电视设备是通过无线电发送的，而这套电视系统是通过有线电缆发送的。这套电视系统试制成功以后，可以给教师和学生们作电视设备的实验和科学研究用，并且为产业部门生产这种电视设备提供经验。
    这套电视系统的试制工作是从去年开始的，现在已经回国的苏联专家萨普雷金夫妇曾给予热情的指导，有关工厂也帮助解决了一部分器材问题。
