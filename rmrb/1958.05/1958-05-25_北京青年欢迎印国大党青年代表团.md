Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Fifteen hundred young people from all walks of life in Beijing gathered this evening to welcome the entire Indian National Congress Youth Delegation, headed by Ravindra Varma.

Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said at the meeting that Chinese youth are willing to work together with Indian youth to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, to safeguard and consolidate the national independence already achieved by both countries, and to develop Sino-Indian friendship.

Delegation leader Ravindra Varma also spoke amidst applause. He said that peace is absolutely necessary for human survival. As long as one country is still exploiting and oppressing another country, then even if they shout loudly about peace and freedom, they are actually just empty talk. He hoped that the youth of China and India would further promote mutual understanding and cooperation, a spirit of understanding and cooperation embodied in the Five Principles statement advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India.

    北京青年欢迎印国大党青年代表团
    据新华社23日讯　北京市各界青年一千五百人今天晚间集会欢迎以拉文德拉·瓦尔马为首的印度国大党青年代表团全体人员。
    中华全国青年联合会主席刘西元在会上讲话说，中国青年愿意和印度青年一道，为维护亚洲和世界的和平，为维护和巩固两国已取得的民族独立，为发展中印友好而共同努力。
    代表团团长拉文德拉·瓦尔马在掌声中也讲了话。他说，和平对人类生存来讲是完全必要的。只要一个国家还在进行剥削和压迫另外一个国家，那他们虽然高喊和平、自由，实际上却是空口讲白话。他希望中印两国青年进一步促进互相间的谅解和合作，这种谅解和合作的精神包含在中印两国总理倡导的五项原则的声明中。
