The rear of the car is equipped with a universal wheel that can drive electric rollers, water pumps, grass cutters, electric saws, etc., and can also be used for rice milling and flour grinding.

    第一部万能汽车
    据新华社包头3日电　包头汽车修配厂各族职工试制成功第一部万能汽车。这部汽车还可以当做一台可以移动的动力机使用。如果农业社买了这样的汽车，就能以每小时三十到四十公里的速度把社员们送到地头，在地里它又能代替拖拉机耕地、耙地、磙地。汽车尾部装有一个万能轮子，可以带动电滚子、水泵、铡草机、电锯等，也可以碾米、磨面。它的优点是轻便、灵活、便宜、用途广。
