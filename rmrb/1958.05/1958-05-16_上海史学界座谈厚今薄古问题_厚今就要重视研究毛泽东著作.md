　　Shanghai History Community Discusses the Problem of Emphasizing the Present and Devaluing the Past
　　Emphasizing the Present Requires Valuing the Study of Mao Zedong's Works
　　This newspaper reports: According to the *Jiefang Daily*, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Historical Society has recently held a series of symposiums to debate the issue of emphasizing the present and devaluing the past. At the meetings, participants deeply exposed the essence of the tendency to value the past and belittle the present that exists in the historical community, and further clarified that emphasizing the present and devaluing the past is the correct guiding principle for current historical science work. Emphasizing the present and devaluing the past requires valuing the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works.
　　History teachers attending the meeting believed that the tendency to value the past and belittle the present in history teaching is not only reflected in the proportion of textbook content, but also in the teaching ideology. For example, some people emphasize the role of Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and Emperor Taizu of Song, believing that this can enhance national pride; some even describe Emperor Taizong of Tang's acceptance of advice as being able to correctly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. This kind of anti-Marxist view of beautifying the ancients and praising emperors, generals, and ministers has had a very bad influence on young students.
　　The symposium focused on analyzing the essence of emphasizing the present and devaluing the past versus emphasizing the past and devaluing the present. Li Ya Nong's speech criticized the argument of opposing academic studies and politics, pointing out that Marxist historical science has both strong political character and high scientific character. Some people say that ancient history has strong academic character, while contemporary history has strong political character. In reality, they are attempting to deny the high academic character of contemporary history and completely obliterate the political character of ancient history. This argument is an excuse for escaping reality, an attempt to resist ideological remolding, and to preserve bourgeois ideology. Zhou Yutong said: "It is a deceptive statement to say that ancient history research has no political character; the reactionary scholar Qian Mu served the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty with ancient history, and Hu Shih used pragmatism to oppose Marxism in ancient history research. Our historical research must serve socialist construction."
　　Wu Ze believes that the bourgeois academic thought of substituting philology for history is indeed a relatively common problem in the historical community. It leads historical workers to delve into tedious textual research, detach themselves from reality, and work for the sake of antiquity, thereby greatly hindering the development of Marxist historical science. The historical community must thoroughly criticize it and must study Mao Zedong's works, adhering to the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to study history.
　　Cao Manzhi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Social Sciences, emphasized that it is necessary to understand the guiding principle of emphasizing the present and devaluing the past from its spiritual essence. Emphasizing the present and devaluing the past requires valuing the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, especially the theory of two types of contradictions, which is a creative development of Marxism, and everyone must study it well. Emphasizing the present and devaluing the past also lies in making ourselves truly socialist historical workers, so we must thoroughly transform bourgeois individualism.
　　Zhou Gucheng, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Historical Society and the host of the symposium, finally hoped that members would implement the decision of the Shanghai Federation of Social Sciences and conscientiously study Chairman Mao's theory of two types of contradictions. He said: "In historical science research and history teaching, politics must be in command, and Marxism must be in command. Older historians must overcome their sense of inferiority in learning Marxism, as this is a fundamental issue of direction. Only by studying Marxism and studying Mao Zedong's works can we contribute to socialist construction; otherwise, we will inevitably run counter to socialism."

### 上海史学界座谈厚今薄古问题  厚今就要重视研究毛泽东著作

　　上海史学界座谈厚今薄古问题
　　厚今就要重视研究毛泽东著作
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：中国史学会上海分会近日来连续举行座谈，争辩厚今薄古问题。会上，大家深刻地揭露了历史学界存在的厚古薄今的思想实质，并且进一步明确了厚今薄古是当前历史科学工作的正确方针。厚今薄古就要重视研究毛泽东同志的著作。
    到会的历史教师认为，历史教学中厚古薄今倾向，不仅表现在教材内容的比重上，教学思想方面的问题也是很突出的，例如有人强调秦皇、汉武、唐宗、宋祖的作用，以为这样可以提高民族自豪感；甚至把唐太宗的纳谏，说成是能够正确掌握批评和自我批评武器，这种美化古人，歌颂帝王将相的反马克思主义观点，在青年学生中起了很坏的影响。
    座谈会着重对厚今薄古和厚古薄今的实质进行了分析。李亚农的发言，批判了把学术和政治对立起来的论调，指出马克思主义历史科学既有强烈的政治性，又有高度的科学性，有人说古史学术性强，今史政治性强，实际上是企图否认今史的高度学术性，完全抹煞古史的政治性，这种论调是逃避现实的一种借口，是想抗拒思想改造，保存资产阶级思想。周予同说：“古史研究没有政治性，是一句骗人的话；反动学者钱穆是以古代史为蒋介石王朝服务的，胡适在古代史研究上是以实用主义来对抗马克思主义的。我们的历史研究必须为社会主义建设服务。”
    吴泽认为以史料学代替历史学的资产阶级学术思想，确实是史学界较普遍存在的问题，它使史学工作者钻到繁琐的考证工作中去，脱离现实，为古代而古代，从而大大阻碍了马克思主义历史科学的发展，史学界必须彻底予以批判，必须学习毛泽东著作，坚持以马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去研究历史。
    上海市社联秘书长曹漫之强调指出必须从精神实质上去理解厚今薄古的方针。厚今薄古就要重视研究毛泽东同志的著作，特别是关于两类矛盾的学说，这是马克思主义的创造性的发展，大家必须很好地学习。厚今薄古还在于使我们自己真正成为社会主义的史学工作者，因此必须彻底改造资产阶级个人主义思想。
    座谈会主持人、中国史学会上海分会主席周谷城最后希望会员执行上海社联的决定，认真学习毛主席的两类矛盾学说。他说：“在历史科学研究和历史教学中，政治必须挂帅，马克思主义必须挂帅。老年史学家要克服学习马克思主义的自馁情绪，这是一个基本方向问题；只有学习马克思主义，学习毛泽东著作，才能对社会主义建设作出贡献，否则必然与社会主义背道而驰。”
