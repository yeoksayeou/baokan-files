Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from TASS: UAR Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, Mr. al-Kouni, held a reception on the evening of the 14th for President Nasser. After Ambassador al-Kouni welcomed the Soviet leaders to the reception, Khrushchev and Nasser gave speeches at the reception.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said at the reception that we have always stood and will always stand on the side of countries fighting for their independence and freedom. We sympathize with the struggle of the Algerian Arabs, sympathize with Yemen, sympathize with Oman, and we sympathize with all countries that are fighting against colonialists for their own independence.

Khrushchev said: We know very well that some countries do not like our policy; even those countries with whom we are willing to improve relations do not like it. We hope to improve relations, but this does not mean turning a blind eye to their delusional actions of enslaving the people of other countries. This is not only not good for them, but also goes against our conscience. We have never done this in the past, and we will never do it in the future.

Khrushchev then said that the Soviet people joyfully and warmly welcomed President Nasser, the national hero of the Arab people. The Arab people have been fighting selflessly against the oppression of the colonialists, regardless of the very powerful colonialist forces that have opposed Egypt in the past and continue to do so now.

Khrushchev said to President Nasser, I think you are convinced of our selflessness, convinced of our loyalty to the cause of all peoples struggling for liberation and building their own independence. We sincerely hope that these countries will develop their own economies and cultures and utilize the achievements of modern science and technology.

President Nasser said in his speech that in the critical moment when we were resisting the aggression of the imperialist countries, the Soviet Union extended a hand of friendship and assistance to us.

Nasser continued, the Soviet Union stood by our side; in the United Nations and at various international conferences, the Soviet Union supported us. He said that when our people were subjected to aggression in Port Said, the Soviet Union defended us. The friendship between our two countries is a testament to the victory of the Bandung Conference principles, and a testament to the victory of the principle of establishing friendship and cooperation between countries with different social systems on the basis of peaceful coexistence.

Nasser pointed out that his visit to the Soviet Union was very beneficial and fruitful. He said that the Soviet people, who are engaged in peaceful labor and striving for the further development of their country and world peace, left a very deep impression on us.

Nasser concluded by saying that the United Arab Republic, as a peace-loving country, hopes for world peace, hopes for peaceful coexistence, and hopes that the leaders of all countries in the world will jointly discuss and reach peaceful agreements that guarantee the tranquility of the people of all countries.

Present at the reception were Voroshilov, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Kosygin, etc., as well as people from all walks of life and representatives of religious circles.

Accompanying President Nasser at the reception on the Arab side were Vice President Boghdadi, Vice President Hourani, Minister of Education Hussaini, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Fawzi.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Moscow were also invited to attend the reception.

　　赫鲁晓夫在阿联驻苏大使招待会上说
　　苏联永远支持反殖民主义斗争
    纳赛尔致词感谢苏联的友谊和援助
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：阿拉伯联合共和国驻苏联特命全权大使库尼14日晚为纳赛尔总统举行招待会。库尼大使对苏联领导人出席招待会表示欢迎后，赫鲁晓夫和纳赛尔在招待会上相互致词。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在招待会上说，我们过去和将来永远站在争取自己独立和自由的国家的一面。我们同情阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人的斗争，同情也门，同情阿曼，我们同情为争取自己的独立而反对殖民主义者的一切国家。
    赫鲁晓夫说：我们清楚地知道，某些国家是不喜欢我们的这种政策的；即使我们愿意与之改善关系的那些国家，也不喜欢这种政策。我们希望改善关系，但决不等于对它们的妄想奴役其他国家人民的行动置若罔闻。这种做法不仅对他们没有好处，而且也违背我们的良心，我们过去一直没有这样做过，今后也永远不会这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联人民欢欣鼓舞地殷切地接待了纳赛尔总统——阿拉伯人民的民族英雄。阿拉伯人民不顾非常强大的殖民主义势力从前和现在一直在反对埃及，他们奋不顾身地同殖民主义者的压迫进行斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫向纳赛尔总统说，我想您已经确信我们的大公无私，确信我们忠于各国人民争取解放和建立自己独立的斗争事业。我们衷心地希望这些国家发展本国的经济和文化，利用现代科学和技术的成就。
    纳赛尔总统在讲话时说，在我们反抗帝国主义国家侵略的严重关头，苏联向我们伸出了友谊和援助的手。
    纳赛尔接着说，苏联站在我们这一面；在联合国、在各种国际会议上，苏联都支持我们。他说，当我国人民在塞得港遭到侵略的时候，苏联维护我们。我们两国的友谊是万隆会议原则胜利的证明，是不同社会制度各国在和平共处的基础上建立友谊和合作的原则胜利的证明。
    纳赛尔指出，他对苏联的访问是非常有益和有收获的。他说，进行和平劳动、努力为自己国家的进一步发展和世界和平而奋斗的苏联人民给我们留下了非常深刻的印象。
    纳赛尔最后说，阿拉伯联合共和国作为一个爱好和平的国家，希望世界和平、希望和平共处、希望世界各国领导人共同讨论和达成保证各国人民安宁的和平协议。
    出席这次招待会的有伏罗希洛夫、科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、柯西金等，以及各界人士和宗教界代表。
    阿拉伯方面陪同纳赛尔总统出席招待会的有副总统波格达迪、副总统胡拉尼、教育部长侯赛尼、外交部长法齐博士。
    各国驻莫斯科的外交使节也应邀出席了招待会。
