Two Kinds of Tension
Kǒng Sāng
    The designers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant had a debate while discussing whether they could trial-produce 40 new products and design 100 new products this year. Some people only saw the difficult side and not the favorable side, thinking the task was too heavy and too tense, and advocated taking it slowly. Others fully estimated the favorable and unfavorable conditions, believing the task could be completed and opposing taking it slowly. After in-depth debate, they reached a consensus: they could not take it slowly; they had to do it on a large scale and quickly.
    In the Great Leap Forward in production, many difficulties will be encountered. We oppose concealing difficulties and denying difficulties. But we are even more opposed to fearing difficulties and conservative emotions that fear heavy tasks and tension. This kind of emotion is not only present in some engineering and technical personnel, but also in some enterprise leading cadres and among the masses of workers. These people verbally agree with the Great Leap Forward, but when discussing specific work, they often oppose speeding up, saying that it makes people too tense and that it is better to go slower.
    To organize a Great Leap Forward in production, to accelerate socialist construction, and to complete the path that capitalist countries have taken for more than a hundred years in a dozen or twenty years, we should of course go all out and be tense, not slow and methodical. This kind of tension is the tension of marching forward with great strides. However, would not accelerating the pace of construction and slowing down the pace cause tension? Not necessarily. Because if the pace of socialist construction is not accelerated, the material and cultural life of the 600 million people cannot be rapidly improved, and if the weather is unfavorable and there is a little flood or drought, the very low standard of living will not be guaranteed. This is also a kind of tension, and a terrible kind of tension, a tension that puts the 600 million people in a passive position.
    It can be seen from this that accelerating the pace of construction will certainly cause tension, and slowing down the pace of construction will also cause tension. It is either this kind of tension or that kind of tension; one of the two must be chosen. The Chinese people have already tasted enough of the taste of passive tension. Our Party led the people of the whole country in revolutionary struggles in the past, and now leads the people of the whole country in socialist construction, precisely in order to get rid of this passive tense situation. Therefore, between the two kinds of tension, we should consciously choose the tension of advancing, muster our energy, strive for the best, and avoid passive tension.
    Of course, the tension of advancing mentioned here does not mean tension without proper rest; it does not only mean increasing labor intensity, but also paying attention to improving production technology, improving production tools, and improving labor management and labor organization. It means exerting both physical and mental strength, and working hard and studying hard.

    两种紧张
    孔桑
    上海机床厂的设计人员，在讨论今年能不能试制四十种新产品和设计一百种新产品的时候，发生了争论。有的人只看到困难的一面，而看不到有利的一面，认为任务太重了，太紧张了，主张慢慢来。另外一些人对有利条件和不利条件做了充分的估计，认为任务可以完成，反对慢慢来。经过深入的争论，他们意见一致了：不能慢慢来，要大搞，快搞。
    在生产大跃进中，是要碰到许多困难的。我们反对讳言困难、否认困难。但是我们更反对畏惧困难，怕任务重，怕紧张的保守情绪。现在这种情绪不只是一部分工程技术人员有，就是在一部分企业领导干部和职工群众中也有。这些人口头上也赞成大跃进，但讨论到具体工作时，却往往反对加快速度，说这弄得人太紧张了，不如慢一点好。
    要组织生产大跃进，要加速社会主义建设，要在十几二十年内走完资本主义国家走一百多年的道路，当然应当鼓足干劲，应当紧张，不能慢条斯理。这种紧张是大踏步地前进中的紧张。然而，不加快建设速度，慢一点走就不会紧张吗？不见得。因为不加快社会主义建设速度，六亿人民的物质生活和文化生活就不能迅速提高，要是天公不作美，闹一点水灾或旱灾，很低的生活水平就得不到保证。这也是一种紧张，而且是一种可怕的紧张，是使六亿人民处于被动地位的紧张。
    由此可见，加快建设速度固然要紧张，放慢建设速度也要紧张。不是这种紧张，就是那种紧张，两者必择其一。被动的紧张的滋味，我国人民已经尝够了。我们党过去领导全国人民进行革命斗争，现在领导全国人民进行社会主义建设，正是为了摆脱这种被动的紧张局面。所以，在两种紧张之间，我们应该自觉地选择前进中的紧张，鼓起干劲，力争上游，避免被动的紧张。
    当然，这里讲的前进中的紧张，并不是不要适当休息的紧张；并不只是加强劳动强度，还要注意改进生产技术、改良生产工具、改善劳动管理和劳动组织。就是要拚体力也要拚智力，要苦干也要苦钻。
