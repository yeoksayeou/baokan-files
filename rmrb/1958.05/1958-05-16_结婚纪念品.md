　　Wedding Souvenir

    This day was market day. Although Fenglan and Quanfu arrived relatively early, there were already quite a few people at the market. They managed to squeeze their way to the entrance of a department store.
    “How about I get you a bolt of floral fabric first?” Quanfu suggested.
    “No, let me buy you a pair of sneakers first.”
    “I’m not in a hurry. You should buy some floral fabric for a new outfit first. You're a bride-to-be, after all!”
    “Stop joking around! – Or you could buy a fountain pen. Don't you want to buy a good fountain pen?”
    “Getting married isn't like going to school, what would I need that for!”
    The two argued for a long time, unable to reach an agreement. Finally, Fenglan said, "How about we look around a few more places?"
    There were more and more people on the street. They were squeezed together in the crowd and couldn't walk together. Fenglan looked back and didn't see Quanfu, so she thought quickly: I'll just buy it for him. She pushed through the crowd, wanting to get closer to the stall filled with various sneakers.
    “Excuse me! Excuse me!” someone shouted.
    Before Fenglan could move aside, a wheelbarrow bumped into her leg. She frowned, and was about to say something, when she saw a piglet for sale lying on the cart, its coat shiny and sleek. Fenglan was immediately attracted to the piglet. "This piglet is really good. It'll be more than a hundred catties of meat by the Mid-Autumn Festival."
    The wheelbarrow passed, but Fenglan's eyes were still fixed on the piglet.
    "Fenglan, where did you go? I've been looking for you for a long time! What are you doing here?" Quanfu walked over from the crowd in front.
    "I was thinking about what we should buy."
    "Have you decided? I've thought about it too."
    "Then you go first."
    "I'll go first, but I don't know if you'll agree. I turned around to look for you just now and saw a wheelbarrow with—"
    "A little piglet!" Fenglan couldn't help but interject.
    "It flashed in my mind, reminding me of our wedding souvenir."
    "What souvenir?"
    "A piglet! I wanted to buy you floral fabric, but you didn't want it; you wanted to buy me sneakers, but I didn't want them; right now, we're promoting pig farming, so if you agree to buy this piglet, then it'll be a souvenir that we both want."
    Fenglan burst out laughing, "We thought of the same thing. I also saw that piglet and was muttering to myself that I wanted to buy it, but I wasn't sure if you'd agree."
    "Then, let's go quickly. If we're late, that pig will definitely be gone. ..."

　　结婚纪念品
  　潘洛
    这一天是赶大集的日子。凤兰和全富虽然来得不晚，可是赶集的人已经不少。他俩好容易才挤到一家百货商店门口。
    “先给你扯一丈花布吧？”全富开了口。
    “不，先给你买双球鞋。”
    “我不着急，你得先买段花布做身新衣裳才对。当新娘子嚜！”
    “就没个正经的！——要不你就买支钢笔，你不是想买支好使的钢笔吗？”
    “结婚又不是上学，要那干吗！”
    两个人争论了半天，相持不下。最后还是凤兰说：“依我说，再多跑几家看看吧”。
    街上的人越来越多，他俩在人丛中挤来挤去，不能一块儿走了。凤兰回头一看，没见着全富，心里一闪：给他买了再说。她用手拨开人群，想走近摆满了各式球鞋的售货摊。
    “借光！借光！”有人嚷开了。
    凤兰还来不及让，一辆独轮小推车已经碰上她的腿。她眉头一皱，正想说句话，一眼看见推车上躺着一只出卖的小猪，身上油光毛亮。凤兰给这小猪一下子吸引住了。“这小猪真好，赶过八月节准能宰百多斤肉。”
    推车过去了，凤兰的眼睛还在瞅着那小猪。
    “凤兰，你哪儿去啦？找你好半天！你在这儿干什么？”全富从前面人群里走过来说。
    “我在想咱们买的东西。”
    “想好啦？我也想好了。”
    “那你先说。”
    “我就先说，不知道你同意不同意？我刚才回头找你，看见一辆推车上——”
    “一口小猪！”凤兰捺不住接下去说。
    “我脑子里这么一闪，想到咱俩的结婚纪念品。”
    “什么纪念品？”
    “小猪！我要给你买花布，你不要；你要给我买球鞋，我不要；当下正号召养猪，这口小猪如果你同意买，那就算咱俩都要的纪念品。”
    凤兰“噗哧”一声笑了出来：“咱俩想的正好一样。我也瞅见那口小猪来着，心里叨咕着想买，正不知道你会不会同意哩。”
    “那么，快走。晚了那口猪准没了。……”
