    Opening Doors to the Vast Ranks of Children
    Capital's Extracurricular Education Organizations Conduct Extensive Surveys of Children's Extracurricular Life
    (Our News) To better align extracurricular education organizations with the actual lives of the vast number of children, staff members from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau's directly affiliated extracurricular education organizations are conducting extensive surveys and research among teachers, parents, and students. Through these surveys, many problems in the work of extracurricular education organizations have been discovered, and a relatively broad and in-depth understanding of the lives and education of children outside of school and at home has been gained, which is of great benefit to further improving the work of extracurricular education organizations.
    Prior to 1956, Beijing's extracurricular education organizations only had one Children's Home. Now, according to incomplete statistics, there are more than eighty extracurricular education organizations, including thirty-four directly affiliated with the Municipal Education Bureau, such as the Children's Home and Children's Palace. These extracurricular education organizations cooperate with schools to conduct communist education for children, carry out various activities beneficial to their physical and mental development, and enrich their extracurricular lives. The work of extracurricular education organizations has been successful. However, in this survey, various parties raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding extracurricular education organizations. Among these opinions, some important criticisms and suggestions were made regarding the mass activities, group activities, and open activities of the Children's Home, pointing out the serious shortcomings of extracurricular education organizations being divorced from politics, reality, and the masses. For example, some Children's Homes have a phenomenon of "conducting activities for the sake of conducting activities," and group activities have a phenomenon of "art for art's sake," only paying attention to the cultivation of skills and neglecting to cooperate with schools in carrying out ideological and political education and labor education for children through activities; some emphasize improvement and neglect popularization, with only a small number of children participating in group activities, and only some more advanced activities. The Xuanwu District Children's Home's dance group excessively rehearses classical dances, and does not pay much attention to dances that combine children's actual lives. In terms of musical instrument activities, the flute and harmonica, which children like to play, are not pursued, but the violin is pursued instead. Through the survey, extracurricular education workers have received a great deal of education.
    This time, the extracurricular life of children was also widely understood. After surveying some primary and secondary schools that implement the three-shift system, the Beijing Children's Science and Technology Museum described the extracurricular life of children as "many, poor, and idle." "Many" refers to the large number of students and the large amount of time spent in extracurricular activities. For example, the No. 8 Middle School has six or seven hundred students in the first and second grades who implement the two-shift system. The extracurricular life of these students is very poor, and they have nothing to do in their spare time. Now, extracurricular activities at No. 8 Middle School have mostly come to a standstill, and only the aviation model group is still persisting in its activities, but it has only absorbed twenty participants. The extracurricular activities of other primary and secondary schools that implement the two-shift system are roughly the same. Because children are very idle outside of school and their lives are not properly satisfied, many children spend their time flipping cards, playing marbles, visiting temple fairs and dawn markets, listening to storytellers, telling fortunes, reading unsuitable books and movies, and some are even influenced by bad elements and engage in gang fights, hooliganism, theft, and other behaviors.
    This survey was very extensive. They surveyed 542 primary and secondary schools in two phases, interviewed 1,485 principals, directors of studies, teachers, and counselors, 252 parents, and 3,064 students. In addition, they also conducted surveys among district women's federations, street offices, residents' committees, work-study schools, and children's reformatories.
    The extensive survey and research work conducted by Beijing's extracurricular education workers this time is a major change in work style during the rectification campaign. Now, they are further studying these materials and discussing and formulating the future direction and tasks of extracurricular education organizations.

    向广大少年儿童开门
    首都校外教育机关广泛调查儿童校外生活
    本报讯　为使校外教育机关更好地面向广大儿童的生活实际，北京市教育局直属校外教育机关的工作人员广泛向教师、学生家长、学生等进行调查研究工作。通过调查，发现校外教育机关工作中的不少问题，比较广泛、深入地了解了少年儿童在校外、在家庭的生活和教育情况，对于进一步改进校外教育机关的工作有很大好处。
    北京市校外教育机关1956年以前只有一所少年之家。现在据不完全统计，校外教育机关已有八十多所，其中市教育局直属的少年之家、少年宫等就有三十四所。这些校外教育机关配合学校向少年儿童进行共产主义教育，开展多种有益于少年儿童身心发展的活动，丰富了他们的校外生活，校外教育机关的工作是有成绩的。但是，在这次调查中，各方面对校外教育机关提出了许多批评和建议。在这些意见中，对于少年之家的群众性活动、小组活动、开放活动等提出一些重要的批评和建议，指出校外教育机关脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众的严重缺点，例如有的少年之家有“为活动而搞活动”，小组活动有“为艺术而艺术”的现象，只注意技巧的培养，忽视通过活动配合学校对少年儿童进行思想政治教育和劳动教育；有的强调提高，不注意普及，参加小组活动的只是很少一部分少年儿童，而且是一些较高级的活动。宣武区少年之家舞蹈组过多的排练古典舞，不大重视结合儿童实际生活的舞蹈，在乐器活动方面，孩子很喜欢吹的笛子、口琴不去搞，偏偏搞提琴。通过调查，校外教育工作人员受到很大教育。
    这次还广泛了解了少年儿童在校外的生活情况。北京市少年科学技术馆在调查一部分实行三部制的中小学以后，把少年儿童的课余生活形容为“多、贫、闲”三个字。多是指学生的数量多，在校外活动时间多。如第八中学初一、二实行二部制的学生有六、七百人，这些学生的课外生活很贫乏，闲着无事可作，现在八中课余生活大都停顿，只有航空模型小组还在坚持活动，但仅仅吸收了二十人参加。其他实行二部制的中小学的课外活动情况大致与此相同。由于少年儿童在校外很空闲，生活得不到正当的满足，许多孩子把时间用到拍洋片、弹球、逛庙会和晓市、听说书、算卦、看不合适的书籍和电影，有的甚至被坏分子影响而发生打群架、耍流氓、偷窃等行为。
    这次调查工作非常广泛，他们前后两次调查了五百四十二所中小学，访问了校长、教导主任、教师和辅导员一千四百八十五人，学生家长二百五十二人，学生三千零六十四人，此外，还向区妇联、街道办事处、居民委员、工读学校、儿童教养院等方面进行调查。
    北京市校外教育工作者这次所进行的广泛的调查研究工作，是在整风当中工作作风的一大改变。现在，他们正在进一步研究这些材料和讨论、制定今后校外教育机关的方针和任务。
