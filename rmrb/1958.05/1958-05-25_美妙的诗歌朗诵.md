    Beautiful Poetry Recitation
    On the 11th, a poetry recitation meeting was held at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing, attended by more than a thousand workers, farmers, students, and cadres. Vivid poems and clear voices brought people to different poetic realms. People felt the torrent of steel surging, and seemed to see the moving scenes of farmers moving mountains and stopping rivers. Most of the more than twenty poems recited at the meeting were created and recited by workers, farmers, and students themselves.

    美妙的诗歌朗诵
    11日，在北京的天桥剧场举行了一个有一千多个工人、农民、学生和干部参加的诗歌朗诵会。生动的诗篇和清朗的声音，把人们带到各种不同的诗的境界。人们感到钢铁的洪流在汹涌澎湃，又仿佛看到了农民们让高山搬家、让河水止步的动人场面。会上朗诵的二十多首诗，大多是工人、农民和学生自己创作自己朗诵的。
