    Playing Deaf and Dumb
    On May 9, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that the United States, "in the capacity of the postal service," forwarded Indonesia's indictment to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and also forwarded the Chiang Kai-shek clique's reply to the Indonesian government. According to this statement, it seems that only the Chiang Kai-shek clique is aiding the rebel group and interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and it has nothing to do with the United States.
    People still remember that not long ago, when Indonesia seized American weapons, the United States said that its weapons are all over the world and can be bought everywhere. When the Indonesian government exposed American pilots for assisting rebel forces in bombing, the United States said that these were done by "individual adventurers" and that the U.S. government could not control them. Now it is using the Chiang Kai-shek clique to prevaricate the Indonesian government's accusations, attempting to evade its responsibility for helping the rebel group and interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. This trick of playing deaf and dumb can no longer deceive anyone. Everyone knows that what the Indonesian government and people are accusing is the US-Chiang elements; even the Chiang Kai-shek clique cannot accomplish anything without the support of the United States behind it!

    装聋作哑
    美国国务院发言人5月9日说，美国“以邮政局的身份”把印度尼西亚的指控书转交给台湾蒋介石集团，还把蒋介石集团的答复转交给印度尼西亚政府。按照这种说法，仿佛援助叛乱集团和干涉印度尼西亚内政的只有蒋介石集团，而同美国无关似的。
    人们还记得，就在不久以前，当印度尼西亚缴获了美国的武器时，美国说它的武器遍于世界，到处可以买到；当印度尼西亚政府揭发美国飞行员协助叛乱分子进行轰炸时，美国就说这是“个别冒险分子”干的，美国政府管不着。现在它又对印度尼西亚政府的指控，搬出蒋介石集团来搪塞，企图规避自己帮助叛乱集团和干涉印度尼西亚内政的责任。这种装聋作哑的诡计，再也骗不了人了。谁都知道，印度尼西亚政府和人民指责的是美蒋分子；就是蒋介石集团，它没有美国在背后的支撑，也是什么事情干不成的！
