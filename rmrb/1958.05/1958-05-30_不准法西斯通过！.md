"No Pasarán!"
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

The political situation in France is rapidly deteriorating. The current situation is characterized by several features: the Pflimlin government, which consistently adopted a policy of compromise and surrender to the fascists and has now resigned, has in effect paved the way for de Gaulle to come to power; US and British officials have changed their ambiguous attitude and openly expressed their support for de Gaulle; and, crucially, the French people have entered into action to save the republican system, displaying a majestic strength, delaying de Gaulle's timetable for taking power, and forcing the French reactionaries to engage in a contest of political forces.

The Pflimlin government, which lasted only fifteen days, adopted a policy of appeasement and tolerance towards the fascists. One of the consequences is that when Pflimlin stepped down, it created an excuse for the French reactionary forces: now, only de Gaulle can come to power to quell the rebellion and clean up the mess... "At the end of the road," "only this way". It was under these circumstances that de Gaulle was summoned by President Coty at 5 pm on the 28th.

De Gaulle, "guarded" by a small team of motorcycle police in front and behind, came to Paris from his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. But when this fascist dictator arrived in the French capital, the French working people and all those who supported the republic, breaking through the government's ban, were holding a massive demonstration of 500,000 people.

This demonstration was organized by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. 200,000 people gathered near the Place de la Nation, Place de la République, and Boulevard Voltaire, while another 300,000 formed a procession in rows of twenty, passing through the above locations and the main streets of Paris. They sang the Marseillaise, held high flags with the words "Defend the Republic" and "No Pasarán!", and shouted slogans calling for Jé-la-ffe (De Gaulle's nickname) to be sent to the zoo. Among those who participated in the demonstration were the leader of the French Communist Party, Duclos, leaders of social organizations such as the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, the "Workers' Force" trade union, the National Union of Students of France, the Teachers' Union, the League of Human Rights, as well as former Prime Minister Mendès-France and the Socialist Party's Pineau.

A significant development is that the unity and cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party is rapidly developing in factories and grassroots organizations. Following the call for a general strike by the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers and the "Workers' Force" trade union also issued a call for a symbolic strike on the 28th.

While the demonstration of 500,000 people was boiling over in Paris, the French Communist Party representatives in the Bourbon Palace National Assembly proposed to the National Action Committee for the Defense of the Republic: the parties participating in this organization should immediately consult and begin to organize a republican government. However, the Radical Socialist Party rejected this proposal.

It is worth noting the political attitude of the Socialist Party leader. On the 28th, Coty summoned the leader of the right-wing Independent Party, Pinay, the Christian Democratic Republican, Teitgen, and the Socialist Party member, Mollet. He directly raised the question: either de Gaulle comes to power, or there will be a Popular Front government. It is not yet clear whether Mollet has affirmatively answered this question to Coty. But the news says: he will use "the greatest effort" to persuade the Socialist Party members to accept de Gaulle's "leadership" rather than a Popular Front. Newspapers also revealed that the secret talks held between Pflimlin and de Gaulle on the 27th were largely facilitated by Mollet. Before the talks, he wrote a secret letter of up to six pages to this fascist leader. It is believed that the reason why Mollet has not publicly expressed his support for de Gaulle is, on the one hand, that he still has to bargain behind the scenes with de Gaulle (someone has suggested to de Gaulle: make some concessions to the Socialist Party in exchange for the party's support, so as to usurp power); on the other hand, he is afraid of the power of the mass movement. Will the Socialist Party leaders prepare to auction off France's democracy and peace to please de Gaulle, or will they cooperate with the French Communist Party to block de Gaulle's path to power? It seems that the answer to this mystery will be revealed in the next few days.

    “不准法西斯通过！”
    本报记者　潘非
    法国政局正在急转直下。目前形势的几个特点是：对法西斯分子始终采取妥协投降政策并业已辞职的弗林姆兰政府，实际上为戴高乐的上台铺平了道路；美英官方改变了它们的暧昧态度，公开地表示了对戴高乐的支持；而有决定意义的是，法国人民为了拯救共和国制度已进入行动，显示了雄伟的力量，推迟了戴高乐上台的时间表，迫使法国反动派不得不进行一次政治力量的较量。
    寿命只有十五天的弗林姆兰政府，对法西斯分子采取了姑息、纵容政策。其后果之一，是弗林姆兰下台的时候，为法国反动势力制造了这样一个借口：现在，只有戴高乐上台，才能平息叛乱，收拾残局……，“山穷水尽”，“唯此一途”。戴高乐就是在这样的情况下，在28日下午五点被戈蒂总统召见的。
    戴高乐由一小队摩托警察前拥后簇地“卫护”着，从科龙贝双教堂的寓所来到了巴黎。但当这个法西斯独夫到达法国首都的时候，法国劳动人民和所有拥护共和国的人士，突破了政府的禁令，正举行着有五十万人参加的大示威。
    这次示威是由共产党和社会党组织的。二十万人集合在民族广场、共和国广场和伏尔泰大街附近，另外有三十万人组成的游行队伍，以二十路纵队的行列通过了上述地点和巴黎的主要街道。他们唱着马赛曲，高举写着“保卫共和国”“不准法西斯通过”的旗帜，喊着把杰拉费（戴高乐的小名）送到动物园去的口号。参加示威的，有法共领导人杜克洛，法国总工会、天主教劳工联盟、“工人力量”总工会、全国学联、教师联、人权同盟等社会团体的领袖，以及前总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯、社会党的比诺等。
    一个有意义的发展是：在工厂及基层组织中，共产党和社会党的团结和合作，正在迅速发展。继法国总工会号召举行总罢工之后，天主教劳工联盟和“工人力量”工会，也在28日发出了举行象征性罢工的号召。
    当五十万人的示威沸腾着整个巴黎的时候，波旁宫法国国民议会中的法共代表，向保卫共和国全国行动委员会提出建议：参加这个组织的各党派立即进行协商，着手组织共和政府。但是，激进社会党拒绝了这一建议。
    值得注意的是社会党领袖的政治态度。戈蒂在28日召见了右翼独立派领袖比内、天主教人民共和党人戴尚和社会党人摩勒。他直截了当地提出了这样的问题：要么让戴高乐上台，要么将出现一个人民阵线的政府。摩勒是否已向戈蒂肯定地回答了这个问题，现在还不清楚。但是消息说：他将以“最大的努力”来说服社会党党员，要他们接受戴高乐的“领导”，而不要人民阵线。报纸还透露，弗林姆兰和戴高乐在27日举行的密谈，在很大程度上是由摩勒促成的。在会谈举行以前，他曾写了一封长达六页的密信给这个法西斯头子。人们认为，摩勒所以还没有公开表示拥护戴高乐，一方面是还要同戴高乐进行幕后的讨价还价（有人已向戴高乐提出建议：对社会党作些让步的姿态，以换取该党的支持，从而篡夺政权）；另方面是慑于群众运动的威力。社会党的领袖准备拍卖法国的民主和平来讨好戴高乐呢，还是同法共合作堵塞戴高乐上台的道路呢？看来，这个谜底即将在最近几天中揭晓的。
