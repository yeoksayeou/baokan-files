　　Fully Exploit Nature's Potential
　　——Introduction to the Agricultural Fixed Power Machinery Hall at the Agricultural Implement Exhibition
　　　　By our reporter Su Qun
In the great leap forward of agricultural production, the broad masses of workers in our country have not only rushed to produce a large number of mechanical equipment for farmers, but also improved and created many applicable power machinery and electrical products for farmers. In the Agricultural Fixed Power Machinery Hall of the National Agricultural Implement Exhibition, you can see biogas and air battery lamps suitable for large-scale promotion in rural areas, as well as various gas engines, boiler-camel engines, diesel engines, gasoline engines, electric motors, wind turbines, etc. suitable for rural use. More than sixty exhibits are displayed in this hall, all showing the rich wisdom of the working people.

When visitors arrive at this hall, they are most interested in biogas and air battery lamps. The commentator pointed to the biogas digester and introduced to the audience: Put human and animal excrement and straw into the biogas digester, add appropriate amount of water, and after about a week, biogas will be emitted. Biogas can be used for lighting, boiling water for cooking, as fuel for cars and tractors, and as power for generating electricity. Rural areas have sufficient biogas raw materials, and biogas stations can be built in every village and commune. After listening to this introduction, people unanimously praised biogas as a treasure.

Biogas was first successfully tested by the Zhongnan Building Materials Research Institute in Wuchang City, Hubei Province, and then tested and promoted in various provinces across the country. Fan County, Guangdong Province, has established 100 biogas power stations this year. By June, all 236 agricultural cooperatives in the county will have biogas power stations. Gansu Province strives to ensure that most rural and urban areas in the province can use biogas by the end of September.

The air battery lamps from Xinxiang, Henan, and Beijing here are extremely popular with the audience. The No. 1 air battery lamp, first successfully created by Xinxiang Battery Factory in Henan, can be used for more than 500 hours and sells for only 3.7 yuan. The invention and creation of air battery lamps has found a fast, economical, and good way for electricity use in vast rural areas. The production method of air battery lamps is simple: process cottonseed hulls, sunflower seed shells, peanut shells, etc. into activated carbon, add chemical raw materials (ammonium chloride, zinc chloride, mercuric chloride), put them into carbon rods to make batteries, and then connect the batteries in series and parallel to form the lamp. The raw materials for air battery lamps can be found in rural areas everywhere, and they are inexhaustible. Air battery lamps have six major advantages: Using air battery lamps can save the country a lot of kerosene; they are suitable for rural well digging, spring development, canal repair, pond digging, cave opening, and household lighting; the cost is low, cheaper than lighting kerosene lamps; brighter than kerosene lamps; not afraid of wind, suitable for outdoor use; safe and hygienic. Now Xinxiang Battery Factory in Henan has produced air battery lamps in large quantities, and Beijing, Harbin, Shenyang, Hebei and other places have also successfully trial-produced them, and they will be mass-produced soon.

Our country is the country with the richest hydropower resources in the world, with a total reserve of 540 million kilowatts. Last winter and this spring, a large number of water conservancy projects were built throughout the country, and now people are asking to build small hydropower stations on rivers and canals. This year, the power generation capacity of small hydropower stations will reach 900,000 kilowatts. How to build small hydropower stations quickly, well and economically? The audience can learn from the experience of the Plain Small Hydropower Station in Tianjin Special Zone, Hebei, exhibited here. Hydropower stations can be built on canals with a drop of about one meter; small water turbines are made of wood; civil engineering is done by local people themselves; the operation of the power station only requires four people to manage. The power generated by this economical and convenient hydropower station liberates people from heavy physical labor.

This year, workers on the industrial front in our country will produce 4 million horsepower of farmland irrigation and drainage machinery to supply rural areas. Because our country's oil sources are still being developed one after another, and oil production cannot fully meet the needs for the time being, in the recent period, various places have converted gasoline engines or diesel engines into gas engines. Most of the gas engines exhibited here have been modified to meet the current needs of farmland water conservancy. The biggest advantage of the 10-horsepower gas engine manufactured by Yangliuqing Iron Factory in Hebei Province is that it uses fire tube ignition instead of magneto ignition, and it has a simple structure, is strong and durable, and is easy to operate. It only takes a month to learn how to use and repair it. Gas engines can use various solid fuels, such as charcoal, wood, anthracite, rice straw, cotton stalks, and the shells of various seeds. This kind of gas engine is suitable for rural irrigation and drainage, power generation, and agricultural product processing.

The diesel engines, gasoline engines and electric motors exhibited in this hall have the advantages of being lightweight and high efficiency.

The boiler-camel engine exhibited here is called a "loyal and honest" machine by farmers. The boiler-camel engine has a simple structure, is easy to use, easy to accessorize, and has a wide range of fuel sources. It can burn anything. Among them, the 10-horsepower boiler-camel engine manufactured in Shijiazhuang has a light body and is equipped with four wheels, making it very convenient to move, which is very popular with the audience.

The exhibited wind turbine is driven by the natural wind power. In Northeast, Northwest and Inner Mongolia of our country, there are almost six months a year with wind power of level 3 or above that can be used. The three-horsepower "Leap Forward" wind turbine generator in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, has an automatic wind direction adjustment device, which can automatically adjust the wind direction according to different wind directions. It can be started with a level 3 wind or above, and is used for power generation, irrigation and drainage, and agricultural product processing. The 85-type wind motor manufactured by Hongxing Wood Industry Cooperative in Lutai Town, Ninghe County, Hebei Province, can drive a waterwheel to lift water for irrigation when the wind is at level 3, and can lift 88 tons of water per hour, and can drive a two-horsepower to three-horsepower generator. The advantages of this wind motor are: it has twelve canvas soft leaves, which can be fully opened when the wind is small, and can be opened less when the wind is strong, and there is a wind vane, which can adjust the size of the wind force at any time. This ensures the safety of the wind turbine.

The utilization of solar energy is also a source of rural power. Viewers can see solar water heaters and solar cookers that use solar energy to boil water and cook here. These are manufactured by Pingliang Solar Energy Machinery Factory in Gansu Province. In the Northwest region, there are eight months of sunshine a year, and solar water heaters and solar cookers can be used to boil water and cook, which can save a lot of wood and coal. At present, the use of solar energy is limited to household life applications. It would be better if solar energy could be further combined with semiconductors to generate electricity.

    充分发挥大自然的潜力
    ——农具展览会农用固定动力机具馆介绍
          本报记者  苏群
    在农业生产大跃进中，我国广大的职工群众，不仅为农民赶制了大量的机械设备，而且也为农民们改进和创造了不少适用的动力机械和电器产品。在全国农具展览会农用固定动力机具馆里，就可以看到适合农村大量推广使用的沼气、空气电池灯，还有适合农村用的各式各样的煤气机、锅驼机、柴油机、汽油机、电动机、风力机等等。在这个馆里共展出了六十多件展品，件件都显示着劳动人民丰富的智慧。
    参观的人到了这个馆里，最感兴趣的是沼气和空气电池灯。讲解员指着沼气发酵池向观众介绍说：把人畜粪便和秸秆放进沼气发酵池内，再加上适当的水，经过一周左右的时间，就会发出沼气来。沼气可以用来照明、烧水煮饭，可以作为汽车和拖拉机的燃料，还可以作为发电的动力。农村有充足的沼气原料，村村社社都可以建设沼气站。人们听了这番介绍后一致称赞沼气是个宝贝。
    沼气首先由湖北省武昌市中南建筑材料研究所试验成功，随后在全国各省进行试验推广。广东省番禺县今年已建立了一百个沼气动力站，到6月份，全县二百三十六个农业社社社都可有沼气动力站。甘肃省争取在9月底以前，全省大部分农村和城市都可使用沼气。
    这里来自河南新乡和北京的空气电池灯，受到观众们的极大欢迎。河南新乡电池厂首创成功的空气电池灯，一号的能用五百个小时以上，售价只三元七角。空气电池灯的发明和创造，为广大农村用电找到了一条多快好省的门路。空气电池灯制作方法简单，把棉籽皮、葵花子壳、花生皮等加工成活性炭，配上化学原料（氯化铵、氯化锌、氯化高汞），放进炭素棒制成电芯，再经过电池串并联就成了。空气电池灯的原料，各地农村都可找到，是取之不尽，用之不完的。空气电池灯具有六大好处：用空气电池灯可以为国家节省大量煤油；适于农村打井、下泉、修渠、挖塘、开山洞和家庭照明等用；成本低，比点煤油灯便宜；比煤油灯光亮；不怕风吹，适于室外使用；安全卫生。现在河南新乡电池厂已大量生产空气电池灯，北京、哈尔滨、沈阳、河北等地也已试制成功，不久就可大量生产。
    我国是世界上水力资源最丰富的国家，总蕴藏量达五亿四千万瓩。去冬今春全国各地兴修了大量的水利工程，现在人们要求在河流和渠道上建设小型水电站。今年小型水电站的发电能力将达到九十万瓩。如何多快好省地建设小型水电站，观众可从这里展出的河北天津专区平原小型水力发电站上学到经验。在跌水一公尺左右的渠道上即能建设水电站；小型水轮机是用木材做成的；土建工程是由当地群众自行施工的；电站的运行，只要四个人管理就行。这种经济、简便的水电站发出的动力，使人们从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来了。
    今年，我国工业战线上的职工将生产四百万马力的农田排灌机械供应农村。由于我国油源尚在陆续开发，油产量暂时还不能充分满足需要，因此，在最近一个时期各地把汽油机或柴油机改装成煤气机。在这里展出的煤气机中，绝大多数是为了适应当前农田水利的需要而改装的。河北省杨柳青铁工厂制造的十马力煤气机，最大的优点是用火管点火代替了用磁电器点火，而且构造简单，坚固耐久，容易操作，一个月就可以学会使用和修理。煤气机可以使用各种固体燃料，如木炭、木材、无烟煤、稻草秆、棉花秆和各种种子的外壳等。这种煤气机适于农村排灌、发电和农产品加工等使用。
    在这个馆里展出的柴油机、汽油机和电动机，具有轻便、效率高等优点。
    这里展出的锅驼机，农民们称它为“忠诚老实”机器。锅驼机的结构简单，使用方便，易于配件，燃料来源广泛，烧什么都可以。其中石家庄制造的十马力锅驼机机身轻，又装有四个轮子，移动很方便，很受观众们欢迎。
    展出的风力机是利用大自然的风力开动的。在我国的东北、西北和内蒙古等地，一年差不多有六个月的时间有三级以上的风力可以利用。黑龙江省安达县三马力“跃进号”风力发电机，有风向自动调整装置，可随风向的不同，自动调整风向。有三级以上的风就可以开动，供发电、排灌、农产品加工用的动力。河北省宁河县芦台镇红星木业社制造的八五型风动机，在三级风时，可以带动一辆水车提水灌溉，每小时可提水八十八吨，并能带动一部二马力到三马力的发电机。这部风动机的优点是：有十二个帆布软叶，风小可全张开，风大可少张开，并有风向杆，随时可以调整风力的大小。这就保证了风力机的安全。
    太阳能的利用也是农村动力的一个来源。观众可以在这里看到利用太阳能烧水和煮饭的太阳能热水器和太阳能灶。这些是甘肃省平凉太阳能机械厂制造的。在西北地区一年有八个月的时间阳光充足，可以利用太阳能热水器和太阳能灶烧水和煮饭，这样就可以节约大量的木材和煤炭。目前太阳能的利用仅限于家庭生活上的应用，若能进一步使太阳能与半导体结合发出电能，那就更好了。
