Using Newly Built Water Conservancy Projects to Raise Fish
Henan's Fish Production Will Increase Eightfold This Year
(Our report) Henan Province is making extensive use of newly built water conservancy projects and existing water surfaces to raise fish. The province's fish production this year will increase by eight and a half times compared to last year, and fish fry production will increase by nine times. Currently, various regions are working intensely on cultivating fish fry and surveying water surfaces.

Through the water conservancy movement last winter and this spring in Henan Province, the area of pits, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs across the province has increased from the original 3.6 million mu to over 10 million mu. Based on conditions in various areas, 5.5 million mu can be used for fish farming this year, producing 60 million jin of marketable fish.

In order to adapt to the rapid development of the fish farming industry, Henan Province is actively training technical fish farming cadres. The method of "county responsible for township, township responsible for commune" is adopted to ensure that every commune has technicians. In addition to the training classes opened by each special zone, fish breeding farms are signing contracts with agricultural cooperatives to provide instruction and learning, with commune members interning at the fish breeding farms. More than 3,000 people have already been trained, and it is estimated that 20,000 people can be trained by the end of the year.

In areas where fish farming has been determined, farmers are organizing the cleaning of reservoir bottoms and carrying out fish pond disinfection, fish seed disinfection, and feed disinfection.

    利用新修水利工程养鱼
    河南今年鱼产量将增加八倍
    本报讯　河南省利用新修的水利工程和原有水面大量养鱼。全省今年的鱼产量要比去年增加八倍半，鱼苗产量要增加九倍。现在各地正紧张地培育鱼苗，检定水面。
    河南省经过去冬今春水利化运动，全省的坑、塘、湖、泊、水库的水面，由原来三百六十万亩增加到一千多万亩。根据各方面的条件，今年可以利用五百五十万亩养鱼，生产成鱼六千万斤。
    河南省为了适应养鱼事业的迅速发展，积极训练养鱼技术干部。采取县包乡、乡包社的办法，达到社社都有技术员。除了各专区开训练班以外，鱼种养殖场与农业社签订包教包学合同，社员到鱼种养殖场实习，现在已训练了三千多人，预计到年底，可训练二万人。
    已确定养鱼的地区，农民们正在整理水库库底，进行鱼池消毒、鱼种消毒、饲料消毒等工作。
