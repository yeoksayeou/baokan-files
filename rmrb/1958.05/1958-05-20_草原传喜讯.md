    Good News from the Grasslands
    Good news has come simultaneously from the pastoral areas of Qinghai and the grasslands of Inner Mongolia: a high tide of pastoral cooperation has arrived. Many herdsmen, riding fine horses and wearing festive attire, are running around joining cooperatives. The news is encouraging!
    Facts have proven that as long as the Party Committee strengthens its leadership, deeply publicizes the principles and policies of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry to the masses, and publicizes the achievements already made in pilot pastoral cooperatives, making the broad masses of herdsmen realize that "joining the cooperative brings hope," they are willing to take the road of cooperation, and the socialist transformation of animal husbandry can be done faster and better. We look forward to even greater good news from the grasslands!

    草原传喜讯
    青海牧区和内蒙古草原同时传来了喜讯：牧业合作化高潮已经到来。许多牧民骑骏马、着盛装，东奔西走地串联入社。消息传来，令人鼓舞！
    事实证明：只要党委加强领导，深入地向群众宣传牧业社会主义改造的方针、政策，宣传试办牧业社已经获得的成就，使广大牧民认识到“入社就有了指望”，他们是愿意走合作化道路的，牧业的社会主义改造也是可以做得快些和好些的。我们期待着草原上传来更大的喜讯！
