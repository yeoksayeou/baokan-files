    Wang Shujin - Creator of the Hand-Operated Grinding Mill
    At the National Agricultural Implement Exhibition, there was a hand-operated grinding mill that won praise from the audience. An elderly woman with white hair, Jin Shufeng, circled around it and watched it for a whole afternoon, still reluctant to leave. She said, "This mill is so convenient; women no longer need to push the mill."
    This hand-operated grinding mill, operated by two people, can grind seventy to eighty catties of flour per hour, improving efficiency thirty times compared to an ordinary mill pushed by humans. Many viewers personally tested this hand-operated mill and indeed felt it was light, nimble, and also powered an automatic flour sifting box. Many people believe this is a significant creation and express admiration for the creator of the hand-operated mill; in fact, the person standing next to this hand-operated mill giving the introduction is the creator of the mill – Wang Shujin. He never attended school and is neither a carpenter nor a blacksmith, but just an ordinary working farmer.
    After the autumn harvest last year, the vigorous water conservancy movement began. Wang Shujin’s agricultural cooperative, the First Agricultural Cooperative of Xinying Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, planned to build two reservoirs, which was later increased to eight. Adding in fertilizer accumulation and sideline production, there was a serious shortage of labor. Wang Shujin thought about it countless times: where can we get more labor? One day he went to the brick kiln and passed a field where a Liberation-style waterwheel was placed at the wellhead. He went up and turned it a few times, which suddenly enlightened him. If the mill could be turned using the waterwheel, wouldn't that free up a batch of women to participate in production? So he started pondering at home, trying to figure out how to install the mill on the waterwheel. Later, with the support of Party Branch Secretary Wang Shigun, he and the cooperative’s carpenters, Wang Renshui, Dong Songlin, Meng Yujing, and Dong Zhutian, quickly installed the hand-operated mill. They also made a flour sifting box based on the principle of a foot-operated sieve, installed it next to the mill, and added a belt to drive it together, enabling automatic flour sifting. In this way, they finally perfected the hand-operated mill. After more than three months of experimentation and improvement, the hand-operated mill was successfully created in January of this year.
    After the hand-operated mill was successfully created, it was quickly promoted in the cooperative. The entire cooperative only made three hand-operated mills, and an average of six people came to grind flour each day, which was enough to supply the entire cooperative's population. Therefore, more than seventy women laborers were saved and put into water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production.
    The hand-operated mill has also been promoted throughout the county. By April, more than six hundred mills had been manufactured in the county. The carpenters Dong Songlin and Meng Yujing, who created the hand-operated mill with Wang Shujin, have been hired as experts on hand-operated mills and have gone to Shandong Province.

    王书金——手摇磨的创造者
    在全国农具展览会上，有一盘博得观众好评的手摇磨。一位白发苍苍的靳淑凤老太太，围着它整整看了一个下午，还是舍不得走开。她说：“这磨多省事呀，妇女再也不用推磨了。”
    这盘手摇磨，两个人操作，一个小时能磨面七十斤到八十斤，比人推的普通磨效率提高三十倍。不少观众亲自试验了这盘手摇磨，确实感到它轻巧灵便，而且还带动一个自动罗面箱。许多人认为这是一个重大的创造，对手摇磨的创造者表示钦佩；其实，站在这手摇磨旁边作介绍的人，就是磨的创造者——王书金。他从小没读过书，既不是木匠，也不是铁匠，只是一个普通的劳动农民。
    去年秋收以后，轰轰烈烈的水利运动开始后，王书金所在的河南省登封县新颖镇第一农业社计划修两座水库，后来又增加到八座。再加积肥、副业生产，劳动力很不够用。王书金脑子里不知翻腾过多少遍：从那里去要劳动力呢？有一天他到砖瓦窑里去，路过一块地里，井口放着一个解放式水车，他上去推着转了几圈，使他猛然大悟，要是把磨放在水车上转，不就能解放一批妇女参加生产了吗？于是他就在家捉摸开了，想法子把磨安装在水车上。后来，他在党支部书记王石棍的支持下，同社里的木匠王仁水、董松林、孟玉敬、董住田四个人，很快就把手摇磨装好了。他们又根据脚踩罗的道理，作了一个罗面箱，装在磨的旁边，另外加上一个皮带，一起带动就能自动罗面了，这样，终于使手摇磨逐步完善起来。前后经过三个多月的试验和改进，在今年1月份手摇磨创造成功了。
    手摇磨创造成功以后，很快在社里推行了。全社只作了三盘手摇磨，平均每天有六个人来磨面就可供应全社人口吃饭了。因此节省出七十多个妇女劳动力，投入了水利建设、积肥和副业生产。
    手摇磨在全县也推广开了，到4月份全县就制造了六百多盘。和王书金一块创造手摇磨的木匠董松林和孟玉敬，已经作为手摇磨的专家，被聘请到山东省去了。
