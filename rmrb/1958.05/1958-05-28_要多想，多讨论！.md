    Think More, Discuss More!
    Tan Qinglu
    Wang Baojing, a young farmer from Shaanxi, became a scientific researcher.
    All farmers should think about this and discuss it. Wang Baojing is a farmer, so why did he become a scientific researcher? Is he an ordinary person, or an extraordinary one? He is first and foremost an ordinary person: born into an ordinary poor farming family; did not study much? He is only twenty-seven years old, and other than a few months as a shop assistant (what people in Guanzhong call a "young gentleman") in a small rural town, he has always worked the land. But he is indeed extraordinary. He dares to think, speak, and act more than most people. Before liberation, as a teenager, he dared to take Party leaflets into the heavily guarded city of Xianyang and distribute them. In the new socialist era, he devoted his spirit of daring to think, speak, and act to the innovation of agricultural production technology. When new farm tools appeared, he tried to find ways to get them and try them out; when new varieties appeared, he tried to find ways to get them and plant them. He researched, he created, he broke with conventions, and did not let go of new things. As a result, they have cultivated seven or eight improved varieties of wheat, corn, and cotton; and are currently testing over one hundred varieties of wheat. As a result, they solved the problem of two crops a year of wheat and cotton. As a result, their commune has trained twenty-five members with a certain level of technical knowledge; most have learned various cultivation techniques. As a result, the total grain output of their commune has more than doubled compared to before liberation. As a result, he became a famous model worker, and as a result, he became a scientific researcher.
    If you think and discuss, you will understand: Wang Baojing's foundation was no different from ours, the only difference is that he dared to think, speak, and act more. As long as you dare to think, speak, and act, ordinary farmers can become scientific researchers. Improved varieties can be cultivated everywhere. Every commune can increase its total grain output by two or three times... What reason is there for others not to be able to do what Wang Baojing has already done?
    All young intellectuals who are determined to advance towards science should also think about and discuss what Wang Baojing's path of scientific research is. His research activities are creative labor in agricultural production; his creative labor contains elements of scientific research. Therefore, while their products are abundant, they also obtain the results of scientific research. This is a realistic, vivid, and lively path of scientific research. Then, are those researchers who shout about climbing the高峰 of science, but in reality only want to钻 in an ivory tower, right? What lessons should they learn, and should they combine with practice? At the same age, and using the same amount of time, Wang Baojing is actually ahead of most people. Isn't this because his direction is right and the path he takes is right?
    All cadres sent to the countryside should also think about and discuss this. Wang Baojing, being in the countryside, can achieve scientific research achievements and become a scientific researcher, so are those views that believe that in the countryside you can only be red but not expert correct? Are those plans to "grit your teeth and be red in the countryside for two years, and then go back to the city to be expert" correct? Whether it is possible and whether it should be red in the countryside and also expert in the countryside, etc.
    There are thousands of good things, and there will also be bad things. Every thing can become a key to enlighten our thinking. Don't let go of a good thing, and don't let go of a bad thing. Thinking more and discussing more is a means of liberating the mind, and it is also called "务虚" (focusing on principles). Only by thinking more and discussing more can we help us to recognize the direction, help us to open our minds and think big, open our mouths and speak big, and let go of our hands and work hard.
    Simplicity is not dullness, but only focusing on practicality without focusing on principles easily leads to dullness. Dullness is first of all not active enough, then it is slow, it is stagnation, and over time it will sink into backwardness.

    要多想，多讨论！
    谭清露
    陕西的青年农民王保京当了科学研究员。
    所有的农民都应该想一想，讨论一下。王保京是个农民，为什么又成了科学研究员？他是个普通人呢，还是个不普通的人？他首先是个普通人：一个普通的贫苦农家出身；没有读过什么书？现年只有二十七岁，除了在一个乡村小镇的店铺中，当过几个月的店员（关中人称这作相公娃）以外，一直是做庄稼活。但他确实又不普通。他比一般的人更敢想，敢说，敢作。解放前，十几岁的孩子，他敢把党的传单带进国民党重兵把守的咸阳城里去散发。到了社会主义的新时代，他把敢想、敢说、敢作的精神，全都投放在农业生产技术的革新上。哪里有了新农具，他要设法弄来试用，哪里有了新品种，他要设法弄来试种。他研究，他创造，他打破陈规，不放过新的东西。因此，他们培育出来了七八种优良品种的小麦、玉米、棉花；正在试种的小麦还有一百多种。因此，他们解决了麦棉一年两熟的问题。因此，他们全社培养了二十五名具有一定技术知识的社员；一般都学会了各种栽培技术。因此，他们全社的粮食总产量超过了解放前两倍。因此，他成了著名的劳动模范，因此他当了科学研究员。
    想了，讨论了，就会明白：王保京的底子，同我们原没有什么不同，不同的只是他更敢想、敢说、敢作。只要敢想、敢说、敢作，普通的农民就有可能成为科学研究员。所有的地方都可能培养出优良品种。所有的社都可能使粮食总产量提高两倍、三倍……。王保京已经作到的，别的人有什么道理作不到呢？
    所有立志向科学进军的青年知识分子，也都应该想一想，议论一下王保京的科学研究的道路是什么？他的研究活动，就是农业生产上的创造性劳动；他的创造性劳动，又都包含有科学研究的因素。因此，他们在产品丰收的同时，也获得了科学研究的成果。这是一条现实的、生动的、活泼的科学研究的道路。那末，那些大喊要攀上科学的高峰，而实际上只是想钻在象牙之塔里的研究者，对不对？他们应该接受什么样的教训，要不要去同实践结合？在同样的年岁，用了同样的时间，王保京实际上跨在了一般人的前头。这难道还不是因为他的方向对，道路走得对？
    所有下放到农村去的干部也要想一想，讨论一下。王保京身在农村，能获得科学研究的成就，当了科学研究员，那么，那些认为在农村只能红不能专的看法到底对不对？那些抱着“咬牙在农村红两年，然后回城市里去专”的打算对不对？能不能够和应不应该红在农村也专在农村等等。
    好事千千万，坏事也会有。每一件事都可以成为启发我们思想的钥匙。不放过一件好事，也不放过一件坏事。多想和多讨论，是一种解放思想的手段，也叫务虚。只有多想多讨论，才能帮助我们认明方向，才能帮助我们放开脑子大想，放开口大说，放开手大干。
    朴实并不是沉闷，但只务实不务虚，容易走向沉闷，沉闷首先是不够活跃，继而是迟缓，是停滞，久之也便会沉陷于落后了。
