An Admonition to the "Tide-Watching Faction"
　　Ji Fu
    In the upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward, the waves roll and the tides surge, awakening people's ideals and ambitions, and inspiring them to move forward continuously. But there are others who do not feel this way. Facing the surging waves, they only enjoy the spectacle, thinking that they can find complacency, peace, and satisfaction outside the vortex of this storm. Sometimes they can't help but shake their heads and comment: "The waves are too high, the tide is too fierce," "The waves will eventually pass, and the water will always be calm," and so on, thinking they are being clever. This kind of person can be given the elegant name of "Tide-Watching Faction."
    Although this "Tide-Watching Faction" is very rare today, it can still be encountered in work. The "Tide-Watching Faction" in work is even more gloomy and worse, because it is not just watching and sighing, but actually playing a negative and retarding role. Their main manifestations are: in the great mass revolutionary movement, especially in the current upsurge of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, they neither actively ignite the flames of revolution in their own work, nor are they willing to consciously set themselves on fire, but instead regard it indifferently and watch the fire from across the river. When the Party puts forward a great call, they do not invigorate their spirits, do their best, and participate in it vigorously, but instead have an ambiguous and skeptical attitude; when a great initiative emerges among the masses, they do not enthusiastically cherish and help it, but instead have a cold attitude, even nitpicking, finding fault, and pouring cold water. Almost all "Tide-Watching Faction" members have a common rule, that is, they never take a step at the beginning of a movement; in the middle of the movement, they are content to be in the middle of the stream, walking and watching, not sincerely praising achievements, not actively overcoming shortcomings, remaining silent, and again shelving matters; but when the movement is over and preparations are made to correct deviations, then, a few strands of hair are twisted into a braid, "attacking one point, exaggerating it as much as possible, and ignoring the rest," at which point they shamelessly say: "Heh heh, I told you so, it's a mess!" Although this "Tide-Watching Faction" superficially participates in the ranks of socialist builders, it is actually a very negative and harmful factor.
    The reasons for the emergence of this "Tide-Watching Faction" may be multifaceted, such as some may be due to cognitive reasons, developing a "slave character" and lacking the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to take responsibility. Some are caused by metaphysical views in their ways of thinking, opening their mouths with "never seen before" and closing them with "how it was in the past," only knowing how to look backward, not daring to look forward, unable to grasp the essence, and unable to distinguish between the primary and secondary. But the main reason is that they have developed into serious political rightism, unable to break through the shackles of individualism, and are half-hearted or even two-hearted with the Party. Therefore, this kind of person often leaks air from the inside when the climate is right, and even stirs up winds, and will degenerate into a countercurrent in the socialist cause.
    All the wishful thinking of the "Tide-Watching Faction" will be shattered today. This is because: first, with the general policy and general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" put forward by the Party Central Committee, we have the theoretical and ideological weapons to fight against the "Tide-Watching Faction." Second, without violating the general policy and line, the achievements and shortcomings in socialist construction are always in a ratio of nine fingers to one finger, and the idea of ​​only picking faults and waiting for corrections is bound to fail. If we discover shortcomings and errors, we must actively correct them, but this is to leap forward better, not to generalize, let alone to lose heart. Third, the Great Leap Forward is the common desire and determination of hundreds of millions of people, and the stuff of the "Tide-Watching Faction" has no market today. Fourth, we have gained experience in fighting against all retarding forces, including the "Tide-Watching Faction," and can resist and overcome any typhoon attacks.
    Now is the time for the "Tide-Watching Faction" to wake up. The only way to wake up is to immediately plunge into the tide of the mass movement, thoroughly wash oneself, and clear one's mind so that one can quickly catch up. Otherwise, closing one's eyes, stubbornly clinging to one's own views, and letting the waves roll forward, leaving oneself far behind, one will only be able to pity oneself and regret it too late.

　　奉劝“观潮派”
　　济夫
    在社会主义大跃进的高潮中，波涛滚滚，潮水奔腾，它唤起人们的理想和雄心，激励着人们不断前进。但是另一种人，并不这样体会，他们面对着汹涌澎湃的浪潮，却在那里一味玩赏，心目之中颇以为自己能在这风浪漩涡之外，得到苟安、宁静而满足。有时还不免摇头晃脑议论一番：“浪太高了，潮太猛了”，“浪潮终归会过去，水总是要平静的”，如此等等，自以为得计。这种人，送他一个雅号就叫“观潮派。”
    这种“观潮派”今天虽然极少，但是在工作中还可以碰到。工作中的“观潮派”，甚至更灰暗、更糟糕，因为它不只是观赏，慨叹而已，而是实实在在地起着消极、促退作用。他们的主要表现是：在伟大的群众性革命运动中，特别是当前的全面大跃进的热潮里，既不积极地在自己工作中燃起革命烈火，更不肯自觉地引火烧身，而是等闲视之，隔岸观火。当党提出一项伟大号召的时候，他们不是振奋精神，竭尽全力，轰轰烈烈参加进去，而是态度含糊，怀疑观望；当群众中出现了一件伟大创举时，他们也不是满腔热情地去爱护去帮助，而是态度冷淡，甚至吹毛求疵，挑毛病，浇冷水。差不多所有的“观潮派”都有一条共同法则，那就是运动开始时自己决不迈步；运动中甘居中流，边走边看，对成绩不衷心赞扬，对缺点不积极克服，不动声色，又是挂账；但等运动一过，准备纠偏，于是乎，几根头发扭成一股辫子，“攻其一点，尽量夸大，不及其余”，那时他们就大言不惭地说：“嘿嘿，我说嘛，糟了吧！”这种“观潮派”虽然表面上他们也参与了社会主义建设者的行列，但是实际上是一种非常消极有害的因素。
    产生这种“观潮派”的原因，可能是多方面的，如有的可能是由于认识上的原因，养成了一种“奴隶性格”，缺乏敢想敢做敢负责的精神。有的是思想方法上的形而上学观点作怪，张口“从来没见过”，闭口“过去如何如何”，只会向后看，不敢向前看，抓不着本质，分不清主次。但是最主要的原因是他们已经发展到政治上的严重右倾，冲不破个人主义的桎梏，同党半条心甚至两条心。因此，这种人常常一遇合适气候，就从内部泄起气来，甚至刮起风来，就会堕落成社会主义事业中的一股逆流了。
    “观潮派”的一切痴心梦想，在今天都是要破灭的。这是因为：第一、有了党中央提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义”的建设社会主义的总方针、总路线，这就使我们有了同“观潮派”作斗争的理论武器和思想武器。第二、在不违背总的方针路线的情况下，社会主义建设事业中的成绩和缺点，总是九个指头和一个指头的关系，那种专挑毛病、等待纠偏的想法是一定要落空的。发现了缺点和错误我们要积极改正，但这是为了更好地跃进，而不是以偏概全，更不是泄气。第三、大跃进是亿万人民的共同愿望和决心，“观潮派”那一套货色在今天已没有什么市场。第四、我们已取得了同包括“观潮派”在内的一切促退力量作斗争的经验，能够抵制和克服任何台风的袭击。
    现在是“观潮派”应该猛醒的时候了。猛醒的唯一办法就是要立即投入群众运动的浪潮，把自己彻底冲刷一下，使头脑清醒起来，以便能够快马加鞭急起直追。否则，闭着眼睛，固执己见，任凭波涛滚滚向前，把自己远远抛在后面，那就只有顾影自怜、悔之不及的份了。
