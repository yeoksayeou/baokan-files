Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 1st: A rally of 200,000 people was held in Jakarta's Merdeka Square on May 1st to celebrate International Labor Day. The resolution passed at the meeting expressed firm opposition to foreign interference, demanded decisive measures against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and supported the government in taking more resolute steps to liberate West Irian.

Representatives of various trade union tendencies unanimously condemned colonialism and imperialism in their speeches, praising the great efforts made by Indonesian workers and people in the struggle against Dutch colonialism and for the liberation of West Irian.

A.M. Datu, representative of the Indonesian Democratic Labor Federation influenced by the Indonesian Nationalist Party, said that imperialism was alarmed by the unity of the Indonesian workers and people, and therefore intensified its interference in Indonesia, supporting the rebel groups attempting to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia. However, the internal unity of Indonesian workers is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the national unity front is becoming wider and more consolidated. This unity has expanded into solidarity between Asian and African countries, thwarting all the conspiracies of imperialism.

Moenir, representative of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union influenced by the Indonesian Communist Party, condemned the interference of the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Indonesia. He said that Indonesian workers firmly support the government in suppressing the rebel groups. He paid tribute on behalf of the workers to the government forces fighting the rebels. Moenir also called on the government to continue taking over Dutch enterprises. He said that the Indonesian people are capable of raising and improving production.

He called on workers to actively participate in parliamentary and local elections, to enthusiastically prepare for next year's general election, and to oppose attempts to postpone the general election.

Labor Minister Sajoeno praised the role played by workers in the struggle to liberate West Irian and build the country in his speech. He called for promoting cooperation between workers, people of all strata, and the government, and for strengthening solidarity between Asian and African workers.

The congress finally adopted a five-point resolution. The resolution supported the government in taking more resolute steps to liberate West Irian, thoroughly eliminate the rebel groups, oppose foreign interference, and take measures to deal with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The resolution also called on the government to help raise the wages and social welfare of workers and staff, expand the freedom of trade unions, and improve the cultural level of workers.

The resolution called on the government to make more efforts in international solidarity to strengthen the struggle against imperialism; to stop wars of aggression and nuclear weapons testing; and to consolidate world peace on the basis of the ten principles of the Bandung Conference. The resolution also called on the people of the whole country to strengthen national unity against imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 1st: According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Labor Minister Sajoeno and Army Chief of Staff Nasution issued "May Day" statements today.

In his statement, Sajoeno expressed the hope that the Indonesian working class would assist the government in carrying out construction work and restoring normalcy to the disturbed areas.

In his statement, Nasution expressed his gratitude for the assistance given to the military authorities by Indonesian workers. He called on Indonesian workers to assist the military in other tasks, such as: liberating West Irian from Dutch colonial rule, eliminating the vestiges of colonialism in Indonesia, crushing the rebels and eliminating foreign subversive activities that threaten Indonesia's national survival.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 2nd: In his "May Day" congratulatory message to Indonesian workers, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit said that the Indonesian working class has recently once again proved that it is loyal to its national interests in the struggle to liberate West Irian.

Aidit said that the Indonesian working class is a staunch fighter against evil bourgeois chauvinism and against national nihilists who ignore the ideals and national interests of the motherland. Our response to bourgeois chauvinists and national nihilists is to hold high the banner of patriotism and proletarian internationalism.
