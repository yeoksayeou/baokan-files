　　Advance in Victory
　　By Editorial Board
    The patriotic health campaign, with the elimination of the Four Pests as its central task, has seen some new problems arise in many counties and cities that have achieved initial victories. One of the most important of these problems is whether or not to advance in victory.
    Judging from the current situation, most people's answer to this question is affirmative. On the basis of the achievements already made, they still maintain vigorous morale, strive to advance in victory, repeatedly sweep and thoroughly eliminate the Four Pests; some places even expand the elimination of the Four Pests to the elimination of Five Pests... eight pests; in terms of hygiene, from achieving Three Cleans to expanding to Four Cleans... Eight Cleans, the environmental sanitation is improved, a health system is established, and health habits are cultivated; after doing a good job in eliminating the Four Pests and emphasizing hygiene, the task of disease prevention and control is promptly enriched. In short, with the progress of the movement, combined with the local specific conditions, when a task is about to be completed, a new task is put forward, winning victory after victory, advancing step by step, as is done in Lixian County, Hebei Province. Recently, the Patriotic Health Movement Committee of Hebei Province issued instructions, mobilizing the 157 counties and cities in the province that have initially reported victories in eliminating the Four Pests one after another to carry forward the spirit of advancing and advancing again, to promptly add new content to the movement, and to put forward further goals of struggle, which is timely. Anhui, Hebei and other provinces carried out a province-wide inspection of the patriotic health movement. After the inspection, it was found that many areas still have dead corners, and some enterprises that are prone to breeding mosquitoes and flies have not eliminated the Four Pests well. Mobilization was promptly carried out in these areas and enterprises to ask them to make up lessons. After the inspection, some good experiences created by the masses were also discovered, such as the method of raising fish in rice fields to kill mosquito larvae in the Hua Dameng Agricultural Cooperative of Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, which can be promoted. Timely inspection is very necessary for further carrying out the elimination of the Four Pests. This can continuously encourage the enthusiasm of the masses and ensure the normal development of the movement.
    However, after some places achieved initial victories in eliminating the Four Pests, they believed that the Four Pests had been eliminated "almost completely" and the patriotic health movement had been carried out "almost completely," satisfied with the achievements they had made, and withdrew their troops without completely eliminating the Four Pests. This is taking the struggle against nature too lightly. The reason why pests can live on for generations is because they have a whole set of abilities to adapt to the environment. People must not be complacent, let alone not pay attention to the elimination of the Four Pests. Disregarding the elimination of the Four Pests is the primary reason why the Four Pests cannot be completely eliminated.
    Judging from the situation in the areas that have already reported victories and basically eliminated the Four Pests, the Four Pests have not been completely eliminated. In fact, it is difficult to completely eliminate them after a major annihilation battle. It is necessary to conduct serious inspections, to constantly discover problems, and to use facts to break people's complacency. From basically eliminating the Four Pests to completely eliminating the Four Pests, there is still an arduous journey, and it is necessary to repeatedly sweep and "mop up." Under such circumstances, if people seize the time to continue to eliminate the Four Pests, the result will be twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, if the Four Pests are not completely eliminated in time, the Four Pests will inevitably multiply more and more, resulting in the abandonment of previous efforts. Even if the Four Pests are completely eliminated, there is still a lot of work to be done. We must also fundamentally change the sanitary appearance of urban and rural areas and eliminate various diseases that seriously endanger people's health. The immediate achievements are only the beginning of victory, and there are still many tasks. New tasks must be put forward one after another, otherwise, the original high morale against the Four Pests will be relaxed.
    In order to make the current patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the Four Pests continue to advance in victory, all localities should, according to the general requirements, combine the specific conditions of the locality, constantly add new content to the movement, put forward new struggle indicators, reasonably allocate manpower during the busy farming season, and take various new measures. Never withdraw troops and wait for the Four Pests to breed in large numbers, so as to abandon previous efforts, which will harm both themselves and their neighbors.

　　乘胜前进
　　本报评论员
    以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，在许多已获得初步胜利的县市，出现了一些新的问题。其中一个最主要的问题，就是要不要乘胜前进。
    从目前的情况看，大部分人对这一问题的回答是肯定的。他们在已获得成绩的基础上，仍旧保持旺盛的士气，力求乘胜前进，反复扫荡，彻底地消灭四害；有些地方并把除四害扩大为除五害……除八害；在卫生方面，从做到三洁，扩大到四洁……八洁，环境卫生搞好了，建立卫生制度，锻炼卫生习惯；除四害讲卫生方面做得较好以后，又及时地充实关于防治疾病的任务。总之，随着运动的进展，结合当地的具体情况，一个任务将要完成，又提出一个新的任务，节节胜利，节节前进，如河北省的蠡县就是这样做的。最近，河北省爱国卫生运动委员会发出指示，发动全省除四害先后初步报捷的一百五十七个县市，发扬前进再前进的精神，及时为运动增加新内容，提出进一步奋斗的目标，这是适时的。安徽、河北等省，进行的全省爱国卫生运动大检查，经过检查，发现不少地区还有死角，有些容易孳生蚊蝇的企业还没有很好地消灭四害，就在这些地区和企业及时作了动员，要他们补课。经过检查，也发现一些群众创造的好经验，如安徽巢县花大门农业社的稻田养鱼灭孑孓的办法，就可加以推广。及时检查对进一步开展除四害来说，很有必要。这可以使群众的干劲得到不断的鼓舞，保证运动的正常发展。
    但是，有些地方在取得除四害的初步胜利以后，认为四害已消灭得“差不多了”，爱国卫生运动也搞得“差不多了”，满足于已得的成绩，没有彻底消灭四害，就收兵罢战。这是把向自然界作斗争看得太容易了。害虫之所以能子孙万代地生活下来，是因为它们有一整套适应环境的能力，人们千万不能自满，更不能对除四害不予重视。对除四害不重视，就是四害除不尽的首要原因。
    从目前已经报捷、基本上消灭四害的地区的情况看，四害并没有彻底地消灭干净，事实上经过一次大的歼灭战也很难完全消灭干净。要认真检查，要不断地发现问题，用事实来击破人们的自满情绪。从基本上消灭四害到彻底消灭四害，还有一段艰苦的路程，还要反复扫荡，还要“扫尾”。在这样的情况下，人们如抓紧继续除四害，则事半功倍。反之，如不抓紧彻底地消灭四害，四害又必然越繁殖越多，致使前功尽弃。即使把四害彻底消灭了，也还有很多工作要作。我们还要根本把城乡的卫生面貌改观，消灭危害人民健康严重的各种疾病。眼前的成绩，只是胜利的开始，任务还多得很，必须一个接一个地提出新的任务，否则，就会使原来对四害的昂扬斗志松懈下来。
    为使当前以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动在胜利中不断地前进，各地都应该根据总的要求，结合当地具体情况，不断给运动增加新的内容，提出新的奋斗指标，在农忙期间合理地调配人力，采取各种新的措施，千万不可收兵罢战，坐待四害大量繁殖，以致前功尽弃，既害自己又害四邻。
