Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: TASS reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda wrote to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev stating that the Indonesian government welcomes the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to unilaterally cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. It hopes that the United States and Britain will also make the same decision, and hopes that all other countries will work together to ensure that this decision is fully implemented.

Djuanda said that the Indonesian government and people hope that the Soviet initiative will soon lead to an agreement between the major powers on completely ceasing nuclear weapons testing through the establishment of effective international supervision. This agreement can later be extended to stopping the production of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons and completely destroying their stockpiles.

　　欢迎苏联停止核试验
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：印度尼西亚总理朱安达写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫说，印度尼西亚政府欢迎苏联最高苏维埃关于单方面停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的决议。它希望美国和英国也作出同样的决定，并且希望所有其他国家共同努力使这种决定得到圆满的实现。
    朱安达说，印度尼西亚政府和人民希望，苏联的倡议很快就会使得大国间就通过建立有效的国际监督来完全停止试验核武器的问题达成协议。这种协议以后也可以扩展到停止生产一切类型的原子武器和氢武器以及完全销毁它们的储备方面。
