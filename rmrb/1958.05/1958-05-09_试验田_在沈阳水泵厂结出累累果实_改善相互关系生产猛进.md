Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 8th: Reporter Lu Munong reports: Over the past month, the Shenyang Water Pump Factory has been using “experimental plots” to improve its leadership style, constantly grasping firsthand information about the factory's production, ideology, and central tasks. They have been using these "experimental plots" to test and boldly innovate on some of the major issues hindering the development of productive forces by pooling the wisdom of the masses. Without any investment or increase in personnel, the monthly output of water pumps has jumped from 500 to over 1,000, which is equivalent to adding a new water pump factory for the country.

After leading cadres and office staff changed their style and started working on “experimental plots,” they quickly discovered that some unreasonable rules and regulations were hindering the development of productive forces. Guo Yujiu, the First Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, discovered while working on the “experimental plot” that the relationship between workers and inspectors was very uncoordinated. Workers often spoke to inspectors in a sarcastic tone, and they often argued over minor issues unrelated to product quality, causing unnecessary work stoppages. This Party Secretary felt that what he had seen firsthand was much more profound than what he had heard in the past about "process disputes and inspection checkpoints." At the same time, he also discovered that the inspectors did not have much to do. After research by the Party Committee and experimentation in the “experimental plot,” it was decided to hand over all inspectors to the leadership of the workshops. After reasonable arrangement and use by each workshop, the enthusiasm of the inspectors was enhanced, and the unity between workers and inspectors was strengthened, which played a good role in controlling the occurrence of defective products. For example, inspector Li Wenxiang took the initiative to assist the work section in holding pre-shift quality inspection meetings and signed quality "mutual guarantee" contracts with the workers. Because the inspectors were skilled craftsmen with high technical skills, the workers guaranteed to diligently ask the inspectors for advice and guidance when they encountered difficulties in production; the inspectors guaranteed diligent inspection and guidance. As a result, the scrap rate of water pumps in Li Wenxiang's work section was reduced from 5% to zero on the first day.

After breaking the rules and regulations that constrained production, the workers' enthusiasm for production soared, and they broke quotas one after another. However, at the beginning, the vast majority of workers' enthusiasm was manifested in simply "fighting physically," so that some workers were so tired that they could not get out of bed. The leaders and workers who were working on the “experimental plot” in the Second Workshop studied this issue and believed that this enthusiasm of the workers must be guided to technical innovation. The “experimental plot” studied the experience of Yan Rongtang, who consistently guaranteed good product quality and high efficiency. All the work that passed through his hands was tapped for potential, and the "strengths" and "shortcomings" were found from it, and Yan Rongtang's operating methods were summarized and enriched. Leading cadres introduced this experience to the workers, guiding them to innovate technically. In one evening, the workers in this workshop and the members of the "experimental plot" put forward nearly four hundred suggestions.

Many of the workers' technical innovations urgently needed the help of technical personnel to enrich and improve. The members of the “experimental plot,” including the Deputy Chief Engineer, quickly organized a large number of factory and workshop technicians to participate and work with the workers, so that a wave of technical innovation quickly formed throughout the factory. Within three days, 6,767 technical innovation proposals were put forward, half of which were adopted, and many were implemented by the workers and technicians themselves. Among the technical innovations that have already been implemented, many have made it possible to guarantee 100% product quality, increase production efficiency by ten times, twenty times, or even fifty times, and solve many key production problems.

The workers' technical innovation wave broke the original production balance. The production capacity of each processing workshop has suddenly increased by more than one time, while the assembly workshop cannot adapt to this new situation. This workshop lacked workers, equipment, and more than 1,000 square meters of operating space. What to do? The leading cadres, engineers, and workers who were working on the "experimental plot" in the Third Processing Workshop finally solved this problem after research and experimentation. Their method was not to add anything, just change the process. They learned from the "experimental plot" that this processing workshop still had a lot of potential. After investigation, it was proved that the parts processed by the workshop did not need to be sent to the assembly workshop for assembly, painting, and packaging. The workshop could directly deliver the finished products. After the decision was made to implement this method, the situation of insufficient operating area in the assembly workshop was eased. Now, several processing workshops are experimenting with the method of assembly by the workshop itself. In the near future, this huge assembly workshop will also be transformed into a manufacturing workshop for processing and assembly, producing more water pumps for the country.

    “试验田”在沈阳水泵厂结出累累果实
    改善相互关系生产猛进
    本报沈阳8日电　记者鲁牧农报道：沈阳水泵厂通过“试验田”改进领导作风一个月以来，不断地掌握到全厂生产、思想和中心工作的第一手材料，把其中的一些重大问题拿到“试验田”来试验，集中群众智慧，大胆革新，一个接着一个地解决了阻碍生产力发展的重大问题。在不投资和不增人的情况下，使水泵的月产量由五百台跳到一千多台，等于给国家新增加了一个水泵厂。
    领导干部和科室人员转变作风，搞“试验田”以后，很快就发现一些不合理的规章制度在阻碍着生产力的发展。党委第一副书记郭余九在“试验田”劳动的时候，发现工人同检查员的关系很不协调，工人常用讽刺的口气对检查员讲话，相互之间常因一些和产品质量无关的细小问题争吵不休，造成不应有的间断工时。这位党委书记觉得过去经常听到“工艺扯皮、检查把关”这类事，都不如这次亲眼看的体会深，同时，他也发现了检查人员事情不多。经过党委会研究和“试验田”试验，决定把检查员全部交车间领导。各车间经过合理安排和使用，提高了检查员的积极性，加强了工人和检查员之间的团结，对控制废品的发生起到良好的作用。例如检查员李文祥主动协助工段举办班前质量检查会，并且和工人订立质量“互保”合同。因为检查员都是技术高的工匠，工人保证生产上有困难就向检查员勤问勤请教；检查员保证勤检、勤指导。这样，李文祥所在工段的水泵废品率第一天就由5％压缩到零。
    在打破束缚生产的规章制度以后，工人生产热情高涨，纷纷突破定额。但是开始绝大多数工人的干劲表现在单纯“拼体力”上，以致有的工人累得上不了炕。在二车间搞“试验田”的领导者和工人研究了这个问题，认为必须把工人的这种干劲引导到技术革新上来。“试验田”研究了一贯保证产品质量好和效率高的阎荣堂的经验，凡是从他手边过去的活，都挖一挖潜力，从中找出“长处”和
  “短处”，总结和丰富了阎荣堂的操作方法。领导干部向工人介绍这个经验，引导工人革新技术。一个晚上，这个车间的工人和“试验田”的成员一起就提出了近四百条建议。
    工人们的不少技术革新，迫切需要技术人员帮助丰富和提高。“试验田”的成员、副总工程师就很快组织厂的和车间的大批技术人员参加，同工人一起来搞，使技术革新热潮很快在全厂形成。三天之内就提出六千七百六十七件技术革新意见，其中有一半被采纳，还有许多被工人和技术员自己实现。在已经实现的技术革新中，有不少使产品百分之百地保证了质量，使生产效率提高十倍、二十倍甚至五十倍，解决了许多生产关键问题。
    工人的技术革新热潮，打破了原有的生产平衡。各个加工等车间的生产能力都突然提高一倍多，而装配车间适应不了这一新的情况。这个车间既缺工人、缺设备，又缺一千多平方公尺作业面积。怎么办？在第三加工车间搞“试验田”的领导干部、工程师和工人经过研究和试验，终于解决了这个问题。他们的办法是，什么也不要增添，只要改变一下工序就行了。他们从“试验田”里体验到这个加工车间的潜力还很多，经过考察证明，车间加工出的部件不必送到装配车间去装配、喷漆和包装，本车间就可以直接交出成品来。这个办法经决定实行后，装配车间作业面积不足的局面缓和了。现在，好几个加工车间都在试验由本车间装配的办法。不久以后，这个庞大的装配车间也将改变成为加工和装配的制造车间，给国家生产更多的水泵。（附图片）
