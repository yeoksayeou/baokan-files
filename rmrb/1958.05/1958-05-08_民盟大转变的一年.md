In the past year, the nationwide rectification movement initiated and led by the Chinese Communist Party has created countless miracles. Leaving aside the great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and in the political, economic, cultural, and educational fields, which have changed the face of our country, the democratic parties, including the China Democratic League, have also undergone tremendous changes and begun a process of fundamental transformation in the great rectification movement. This was almost unimaginable a year ago.

A year ago, people had different views on the democratic parties and their members. Some thought that the democratic parties had made certain contributions in the democratic revolution and should now be assistants to the Communist Party and a force truly serving socialism. Some mistakenly believed that after the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, the democratic parties would last forever, and transformation did not seem important. Still others believed that the democratic parties were empty signboards, memorial tablets, flower vases, eyebrows, or "prolonged life with illness," in short, dispensable and unable to play a role. Whether these views were well-intentioned or malicious, many people were unclear about what the democratic parties were and what they did. Even a large proportion of the members of the democratic parties had a vague understanding, being in Mount Lu and not recognizing its true face.

Before the anti-Rightist struggle, most members of the China Democratic League did not recognize the necessity of ideological transformation. The anti-Rightist struggle gradually awakened them, gradually made them realize their true colors, and also recognize the true colors of the party they participated in.

Then came the extraordinary spring of 1957. "Suddenly, dark clouds rolled in the Chinese sky." Among the "heroes" who were stirring up trouble, a large proportion were the backbone members of the democratic parties, with the China Democratic League under the control of the Zhang-Luo alliance appearing even more prominent. On June 8, the People's Daily first published the editorial "What is the reason for this?" Later, the People's Daily also published a news headline like this: "Noteworthy Trends in the China Democratic League." During the period of the Rightists' frantic attacks, the trends in the China Democratic League were not only "noteworthy," but also surprising. Obviously, at that time, the China Democratic League was not dispensable and unable to play a role, but played a particularly bad role. At that time, the China Democratic League was by no means an assistant to the Party, but rather hindering the Party; it was not serving socialism, but wanted to take the old road of capitalism.

From another perspective, the Rightists' attack on the Party and socialism was indeed a good thing. It made people begin to pay attention to and recognize the essence of the democratic parties; in particular, it enabled most members of the democratic parties to gradually wake up from a confused mental state, and through the anti-Rightist struggle and general rectification, gradually recognize their true colors, and also recognize the true colors of the party they participated in.

The democratic parties are basically composed of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, and are bourgeois political parties. The historical conditions of the Chinese revolution determined that in the democratic revolution stage, the democratic parties could jointly complete the task of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism under the correct leadership of the Communist Party; when the five types of economies of the New Democracy still existed, the democratic parties as bourgeois parties also had a certain representativeness. Although the contradictions and struggles between the two roads of the workers' class party still existed, they were not prominent. But when the socialist revolution had already achieved victory on the economic front, and the capitalist economy had become a reactionary economy, the democratic parties attached to the old foundation would either transform into a political force truly serving socialism through the fundamental transformation of organization and members, or would inevitably form a sharp opposition to the socialist system and the interests of the broad masses of working people.

Most members of the China Democratic League are bourgeois intellectuals. When the Chinese Communist Party announced the rectification, it gave the bourgeois intellectuals the sincere advice of "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" This meant that it required bourgeois intellectuals to change their political stance, combine with workers and peasants, and become worker-class intellectuals in order to truly serve socialism. However, those who spoke earnestly were ignored by those who listened casually. A large proportion of intellectuals had not truly recognized themselves or the necessity of ideological transformation, and did not give due attention to this advice. As for the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightists, they were even more unwilling to attach themselves to the new skin of the workers' class, and preferred to attach themselves to the old skin of reactionary capitalism.

Now it seems that the bourgeois Rightists are essentially agents of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Because after the disappearance of the capitalist economic base, the only way to take the capitalist road in China is to return to the old road of semi-colonial and semi-feudalism. The rampant attacks of the Rightists, on the one hand, reflected the intensification of class struggle on the political and ideological fronts after the high tide of the three major transformations, reflecting the resolute resistance of a part of the bourgeoisie; on the other hand, it was also due to the international influence of revisionist thought. The Rightist Zhang Bojun said: "After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, influenced by revisionism, once the rectification movement began, I exposed my Rightist face and carried out anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities." Indeed, in the second half of 1956, imperialists used the weapon of revisionism to incite a group of soulless bourgeois intellectuals in Hungary and Western countries, which for a time set off an anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave internationally, but as a result they suffered a miserable defeat. At that time, domestic Rightists in China picked up this set of old weapons and fanned the flames among Chinese bourgeois intellectuals, launching attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism. As a result, this turmoil did not cause real disaster, and what was burned was the Rightists themselves.

The reason why this turmoil was created in May and June 1957 was not only due to the agitation and incitement of a few Rightists, but also because the Rightists' reactionary stance and views still had a market among the broad masses of middle elements. For example, at that time, Rightists in the China Democratic League were only a minority, while most members were bourgeois intellectuals in an intermediate state, who had not yet abandoned the bourgeois stance, and still had two-sidedness, with one side accepting socialism and the other side leading to capitalism. In the general rectification, the understanding and awareness of the China Democratic League comrades were greatly improved. From the big-character posters, big blooming and contending, and big debates, especially from the recent movement of entrusting one's heart to the Party, the China Democratic League comrades themselves revealed some startling facts: many people resonated with the Rightists; many Rightist speeches and the erroneous viewpoints of revisionism had a broad market among bourgeois intellectuals. It should be admitted that the leftists within the China Democratic League did not fully recognize the class nature of the democratic parties and the two-sidedness of intellectuals at that time, and were not sensitive to the intensification of class struggle at that time. Due to the above reasons, only a few Rightists were able to usurp the leadership of the China Democratic League, tamper with the political direction of the China Democratic League, and use the legal organization of the China Democratic League to launch frantic attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism.

After the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification, the organization and members of the China Democratic League began to transform from the capitalist stance to the socialist stance, and the two-sidedness of intellectuals began to transform to the one-sidedness of socialism. It was recognized that the organization and members of the China Democratic League could not serve socialism without fundamental transformation.

The countless facts revealed by the China Democratic League comrades themselves and mutually revealed in the rectification movement undeniably show that the China Democratic League is a bourgeois political party, and most members of the China Democratic League have two-sidedness and have not completely abandoned the bourgeois stance. Therefore, before the organization and members of the China Democratic League have undergone fundamental transformation, not only can they not truly serve socialism, but to a certain extent, they contradict and oppose the socialist revolution that is being carried out in our country.

Chairman Mao instructed us: "The result of the mutual struggle of the opposing sides of the contradiction is that they transform each other under certain conditions." Bad things can be transformed into good things, failure can be transformed into success, and negative forces can be transformed into positive forces. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the rectification movement stated at the outset: "In order for our Party and the working class to be able to further and better lead the transformation of the entire society and the construction of a new society, to be able to better mobilize all positive forces, unite all who can be united, and transform negative forces into positive forces, and strive for the goal of building a great socialist country, it is necessary to transform ourselves at the same time."

As a result of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, the organization and members of the China Democratic League have begun to transform to the opposite side, from negative forces to positive forces, from the capitalist stance to the socialist stance, and from the two-sidedness of intellectuals to the one-sidedness of socialism. The process of transformation is the process of fundamental transformation. The correct leadership of the Communist Party and the new situation of the Great Leap Forward created by the nationwide rectification movement are the most favorable conditions for promoting transformation and accelerating transformation.

The rectification movement not only exposed, revealed, and criticized the Rightists who controlled the leading organs of the China Democratic League, and settled accounts with the Rightist line, but more importantly, educated and raised the middle and left factions within the China Democratic League. The rectification movement educated them, recognizing that the China Democratic League is still a bourgeois political party before it has been fundamentally transformed. The rectification movement educated most members of the China Democratic League, recognizing and acknowledging that they are still two-sided, still bourgeois intellectuals, before they have transformed their political stance. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between bourgeois political parties, bourgeois intellectuals and the socialist road. Therefore, it is impossible for the organization and members of the China Democratic League to serve socialism without fundamental transformation.

Bourgeois intellectuals began to consciously throw themselves into the revolutionary furnace, began to get used to criticism and self-criticism, got used to relying on the strength of the masses, and believed in the majority of the masses, thereby beginning to recognize themselves and demand to accelerate their transformation.

Through a series of rectification movements such as the anti-Rightist struggle, big-character posters, big debates, the establishment of self-transformation covenants, appraisal competitions, entrusting one's heart to the Party, and the formulation of personal plans, bourgeois intellectuals began to consciously throw themselves into the revolutionary furnace, began to get used to criticism and self-criticism, got used to relying on the strength of the masses, and believed in the majority of the masses, thereby beginning to recognize themselves. Recognizing oneself is not an easy task for most intellectuals. Recognizing oneself is a key, and with this key, the door to self-transformation is opened. As a historian in Shanghai said: "After entrusting my heart and recognizing myself, I have changed from not recognizing that I need transformation to demanding to accelerate transformation."

The great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has enabled the China Democratic League to begin a process of fundamental transformation.

"Entrust your heart to the Party and revolutionize your own life" is the loudest slogan among intellectuals today. Many people express this sincere demand from the depths of their hearts, and naturally there are others who echo it. But in any case, the great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has enabled the China Democratic League to begin a process of fundamental transformation, enabling a large proportion of intellectuals to begin the fundamental transformation of their political stance. A large proportion of comrades in the China Democratic League demanded that they change from wavering to wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party, from "not red or expert" and "expert but not red" to demanding "both red and expert, even redder and more expert," and from "valuing the past over the present" to demanding "valuing the present over the past." A year ago, these were unimaginable. I deeply realize that it is the great and correct leadership of the Party, the correctness of Marxism-Leninism, and the great role of the rectification movement that have made the great transformation of the democratic parties and the intellectuals among them possible in the past year.

Of course, the fundamental transformation is only the beginning, and the fundamental transformation of the organization and members of the democratic parties is far from being completed. But so far, we have achieved important achievements and experience. Two particularly valuable lessons are worth mentioning: First, the transformation of the organization and the transformation of people are necessary, and transformation is a necessary condition and foundation for implementing the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. Second, the organization can be transformed, and people can also be transformed, including Rightists.

    民盟大转变的一年
    胡愈之
    在过去一年中间，中国共产党发起和领导的全民整风运动，创造出无数奇迹。且不说工农业生产和政治、经济、文化、教育各方面的大跃进，使我们的国家改变了面貌，单说各民主党派，包含中国民主同盟在内，在伟大的整风运动中，也发生了翻天覆地的大变化，开始了脱胎换骨的大转变，这在一年以前几乎是不能想像的。
    一年以前，人们对民主党派及其成员，有各种不同的看法。有人以为民主党派在民主革命中有过一定贡献，现在应该是共产党的助手，已经是真正为社会主义服务的力量。有人错误地认为长期共存、互相监督的方针提出以后，民主党派千秋万岁，改造似乎不是重要的了。另有一些人又认为民主党派是空招牌、是灵位牌、是花瓶、是眉毛、是“带病延年”，总之是可有可无，起不了作用。不论这些看法，是善意、是恶意，总之很多人对于民主党派是什么，是干啥，认识不清。连民主党派的成员，也有很大一部分，认识模糊，身在庐山中，不识庐山真面目。
    在反右派斗争以前，民盟的大部分成员没有认识立场改造的必要。反右派斗争使他们逐步清醒过来，逐步认识了自己的真面目，也认识了自己所参加的党派的真面目。
    于是不平常的1957年春天到来了。“中国天空上忽然乌云乱翻。”在呼风唤雨，推涛作浪的“英雄好汉”中间，很大一部分是民主党派的骨干分子，章罗联盟篡夺之下的民盟显得更加突出。6月8日人民日报首先发表了“这是为什么？”的社论。以后，人民日报又登出这样的一个新闻标题：“可注意的民盟动向。”在右派分子猖狂进攻的时期，民盟的动向，不只是“可注意”而已，而是使人们大吃一惊的。显然，在当时民盟不是可有可无，起不了作用，而是起了特别恶劣的作用。在当时，民盟也决不是党的助手，而是替党帮倒忙；不是为社会主义服务，而是要走资本主义的旧道路。
    右派分子对党对社会主义的进攻，从另一个角度来看，确实是一件好事。它使人们开始注意并且认识到民主党派的实质；特别是它使民主党派的大部分成员，从迷迷糊糊的精神状态中，逐步清醒过来，并且通过反右派斗争和一般整风，逐步认识了自己的真面目，也认识了自己所参加的党派的真面目。
    民主党派基本上是由资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子所组成，是资产阶级性的政党。中国革命的历史条件决定，在民主革命阶段，民主党派在共产党的正确领导下可以共同完成反帝反封建的任务；在新民主主义五种经济还存在的时候，作为资产阶级性质的民主党派也还有一定的代表性，它们与工人阶级政党之间的两条道路的矛盾和斗争虽然存在着，但是还不突出。但是到了社会主义革命在经济战线上已经取得胜利，资本主义的经济已成为反动的经济，附着在旧的基础上的民主党派，要么经过组织和成员的根本改造，变成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量，不然就将不可避免地同社会主义制度和广大劳动人民的利益，形成尖锐的对立。
    民盟的大部分成员是资产阶级知识分子。中国共产党在宣布整风的同时，就向资产阶级的知识分子提出“皮之不存，毛将焉附”的忠告，这就是说，要求资产阶级知识分子，改变政治立场，与工农结合，成为工人阶级知识分子，才能真正为社会主义服务。但是言者谆谆，听者藐藐，很大一部分知识分子还没有真正认识自己，认识立场改造的必要，对于这一忠告，没有予以应有的重视。至于章罗联盟和其他右派分子，更加不愿依附工人阶级这一张新皮，宁愿依附在反动的资本主义的旧皮上面。
    现在看来，资产阶级右派分子，实质上是帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义的代理人。因为资本主义经济基础消失之后，要在中国走资本主义道路，只有是回到半殖民地半封建的老路。右派的猖狂进攻，一方面反映三大改造高潮以后，在政治战线和思想战线上的阶级斗争尖锐化，反映一部分资产阶级坚决反抗，另一方面也由于修正主义思潮的国际影响。右派分子章伯钧说：“到了苏共二十次代表大会以后，受了修正主义的影响，一旦在整风运动开始时，我就暴露了右派的面目，进行反党、反人民、反社会主义的活动。”的确，1956年下半年，帝国主义者，用了修正主义的武器，在匈牙利和西方国家内，煽惑一批没有灵魂的资产阶级知识分子，曾经一时间在国际掀起反苏反共的浪潮，可是结果他们得到了惨败。当时中国国内右派分子就拾取了这一套陈旧武器，在中国资产阶级知识分子中间，煽风点火，向党、向人民、向社会主义进攻。其结果，这一场风波没有造成真正的灾祸，而被烧掉的是右派分子自己。
    1957年5、6月之所以造成这一场风波，不只是由于少数右派的兴风作浪，煽风点火，而且是由于右派的反动立场和观点在广大的中间分子中还有市场，例如当时民盟右派分子只是少数，而大多数成员是属于中间状态的资产阶级知识分子，还没有抛弃资产阶级立场，还存在着两面性，有接受社会主义的一面，也有通向资本主义的一面。在一般整风中，民盟同志的认识和觉悟大大提高。从大字报、大鸣大放、大辩论中，特别是从最近的向党交心运动中，民盟同志们自己揭发出一些惊心怵目的事实：很多人和右派分子共鸣；很多右派言论主张和修正主义的错误论点，在资产阶级知识分子中间有广大市场。应该承认，民盟内部的左派，当时也没有充分认识民主党派的阶级本质和知识分子的两面性，对于当时阶级斗争的尖锐化，感觉不锐敏。由于上述各种原因才使少数右派分子有可能篡夺民盟领导权，窜改民盟政治方向，利用民盟的合法组织，以向党、向人民、向社会主义进行猖狂的进攻。
    经过反右派斗争和整风，民盟的组织和成员开始由资本主义立场向社会主义立场转化，由知识分子的两面性，开始向社会主义的一面性转化。认识到民盟组织和成员不进行根本改造，就不可能为社会主义服务。
    在整风运动中民盟同志们自己揭露和相互揭发的无数事实，无可争辩地说明：民盟是资产阶级性的政党，民盟的大部分成员具有两面性，没有完全抛弃资产阶级立场。因此，民盟的组织和成员，在没有经过根本改造之前，不但不能真正为社会主义服务，并且在一定程度上，是和我国正在进行的社会主义革命互相矛盾、互相对立的。
    毛主席指示我们：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。”坏事可以转化为好事，失败可以转化为成功，消极力量可以转化为积极力量。中共中央关于整风运动的指示开宗明义就说：“我们的党和工人阶级要能够进一步地更好地领导全社会的改造和新社会的建设，要能够更好地调动一切积极力量，团结一切可能团结的人，并且将消极力量转化为积极力量，为着建设一个伟大的社会主义国家的目标而奋斗，必需同时改造自己。”
    反右派斗争胜利的结果，民盟的组织和成员，已经开始在向对立面转化的过程中，由消极力量开始转化为积极力量，由资本主义立场开始向社会主义立场转化，由知识分子的两面性，开始向社会主义的一面性转化。转化的过程就是根本改造的过程。共产党的正确领导和全民整风运动所造成的大跃进的新形势，是促进转化和加速改造的最有利条件。
    整风运动不但暴露、揭发、批判了控制民盟领导机构的右派分子，清算了右派路线，更重要的是教育和提高了民盟内部的中间派和左派。整风运动教育了他们，认识到民盟在未经根本改造之前，仍然是资产阶级性的政党。整风运动教育了大多数民盟成员，认识并且承认了自己在没有改造政治立场之前，仍然是具有两面性的，仍然是资产阶级知识分子。资产阶级政党、资产阶级知识分子和社会主义道路之间，存在着不可调和的矛盾。因此民盟的组织和成员，不进行根本改造要想为社会主义服务是不可能的。
    资产阶级知识分子开始自觉地投到革命的熔炉里，开始习惯于批评和自我批评，习惯于倚靠群众的力量，相信群众的多数，从而开始认识了自己，要求加速改造自己。
    通过反右派斗争、大字报、大辩论、订立自我改造公约、评比竞赛、向党交心、订个人规划等等一系列的整风运动，资产阶级知识分子开始自觉地投身到革命的熔炉里，开始习惯于批评与自我批评，习惯于倚靠群众的力量，相信群众的多数，从而开始认识了自己。认识自己，从大多数知识分子来说，不是一件容易的事。认识自己，这是一把钥匙，有了这钥匙，自我改造的大门就打开了。正如上海一位历史学家所说：“交了心认识了自己，从不认识自己需要改造，变为要求加速改造了。”
    政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义大革命，使民盟开始了脱胎换骨的大转变。
    “把心交给党，革自己的命”，这是今天知识分子中间最响亮的口号。很多人是从心灵深处发出这种真挚的要求，自然也有另一些人是随声附和。但是无论如何，在政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义大革命已经使民盟开始了脱胎换骨的大转变，使知识分子中间很大一部分开始了政治立场的根本改造。民盟很大一部分同志要求自己从三心两意改变为一心一意接受党的领导，从“不红不专”、“专而不红”要求“又红又专、更红更专”，从“厚古薄今”、要求“厚今薄古”。在一年以前，这些都是不能设想的。我深深地体会到党的伟大的正确的领导、马克思列宁主义的正确性和整风运动的巨大作用，才使民主党派和它们中间的知识分子这一年来的大转变成为可能了。
    自然，脱胎换骨的大转变还不过是开端，民主党派组织和成员的根本改造还远没有达到完成的地步。但是到目前为止，我们已取得了重要的成就和经验。值得特别提出的两条极可宝贵的教训是：第一、组织的改造和人的改造是必要的，改造是贯彻长期共存互相监督的方针的必要条件和基础。第二、组织是可以改造的，人也是可以改造的，其中也包含右派分子在内。
