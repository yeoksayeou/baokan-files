    Guaranteeing Timely Water Supply for Crops
    Guangdong Fully Implements Scientific Water Use

    (Our Report) Guangdong Province will fully implement scientific water use and rational irrigation and drainage on its nearly 40 million mu of cultivated land with water conservancy facilities this year. This will ensure that various crops receive the necessary amount of water at all times. At the same time, through this approach, the province aims to expand the irrigated area by another 10% on cultivated land that already has a drought resistance capacity of more than 60 days. For cultivated land with drought resistance capacity less than 60 days, it should be raised to 60 days. This was decided at the recent Guangdong Provincial Water Conservancy and Irrigation Management Conference.

    Last year, after 150,000 mu of paddy fields in Guangdong Province implemented scientific water use, they generally yielded more than fields with the same soil quality, sunlight, and technical measures. According to the pilot results in key areas of scientific water use in Chaoan, Wuhua, Xinhui, Lianjiang, Maoming and other counties, its advantage is that it can guarantee a balanced water supply and supply water to crops according to the specifications of high-yield irrigation, which can achieve increased production. At the same time, it can also expand the irrigated area and improve drought resistance. Therefore, scientific water use and rational irrigation and drainage are important measures to fully utilize the capacity of water conservancy facilities and ensure increased agricultural production.

    Comrades at the meeting said that in the past few years, many areas in the province only focused on building water conservancy projects, neglecting the management and maintenance of water conservancy projects, resulting in huge water waste. According to estimates by the water conservancy department, the utilization rate of water storage in water conservancy projects throughout the province is generally around 50%. The rest is wasted in vain. After discussion, the participants decided that the province's current 38 million mu of cultivated land that has not yet implemented scientific water use should fully implement scientific water use this year. For all mechanical irrigation and drainage projects in the province, each horsepower originally irrigated 45 mu of cultivated land, which should be doubled this year.

    保证农作物适时得到必需水量
    广东全面推行科学用水
    本报讯　广东省近四千万亩有水利设备的耕地，今年要全部实行科学用水，合理排灌，保证各种农作物每个时间都得到需要的水量；同时通过这种做法，使全省现有六十天以上抗旱能力的耕地，今年再扩大灌溉面积10％，抗旱能力未达到六十天的则要提高到六十天。这是最近举行的广东省水利灌溉管理会议上决定的。
    广东省去年有十五万亩水田推行科学用水后，一般都比同样土质、阳光、技术措施的田地增产。根据潮安、五华、新会、廉江、茂名等县的科学用水重点地区试行结果，它的好处是能够保证供水平衡、农作物按照丰产灌溉规格进行供水，可以获得增产；同时还可以扩大灌溉面积、提高抗旱能力，因此，科学用水、合理排灌是充分发挥水利设备能力、保证农业增产的一项重要措施。
    与会同志说，过去几年，全省许多地区只抓兴建水利工程，忽视管养水利工程，水利浪费很大。根据水利部门的估计，全省水利工程储水量的利用率一般在50％左右。其余的白白浪费掉了。与会者经过讨论，决定全省目前尚未推行科学用水的三千八百多万亩耕地今年要全部实行科学用水；全省所有机械排灌工程原来每马力灌溉四十五亩耕地，今年要翻一翻。
