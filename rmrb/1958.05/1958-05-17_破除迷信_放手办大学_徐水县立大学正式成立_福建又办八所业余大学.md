　　Break Superstition, Let Go and Run Universities
    Xushui County University Officially Established
    Fujian Opens Eight More Spare-Time Universities
    (Reported in-house) After a short period of intense preparation, Xushui County University in Hebei Province was officially established on the 15th.
    Xushui County University currently has more than 170 students and faculty. The 150 students enrolled in the first semester are divided into two classes. The regular class includes liberal arts and sciences foundation courses, and also offers six disciplines such as soil and insects. The students study for a term of four years. This class currently has more than 40 students. In the future, disciplines will be appropriately added, and students will be increased. After the students in this class complete their studies, they will be assigned by the county authorities to engage in agricultural production and construction and agricultural scientific research in the local area. The university also has an affiliated agricultural middle school teacher training class. This class currently has more than 100 students, and the content of study mainly includes basic knowledge and operational skills such as soil improvement, agricultural irrigation, rational fertilization, the use and repair of locomotive boilers and gas engines, water conservancy, and biogas power generation. After the students complete their studies, they will be introduced by the county to agricultural middle schools to serve as teachers.
    The university currently has nine associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, all of whom are part-time. Three of them are cadres in the county's agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy departments who have graduated from universities and have certain production experience. The other six are scientific researchers, professors, and lecturers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hebei Agricultural College, and other departments who often come to Xushui County to conduct investigations, research, and teaching practice. The Xushui County Party Committee has appointed a deputy secretary to serve as the president. Responsible party cadres also serve concurrently as lecturers in the school's political theory courses. The students are recruited through on-the-spot selection, with some being in-service cadres and primary school teachers with junior and senior high school cultural levels, and others being liberal arts and science students who will graduate from the county's later normal school this summer. The quality of the students is also very good.
    The university will implement a half-work, half-study system according to the principle of diligence and frugality in education, combining production and learning. The school's expenses and student living expenses are all solved by their own production income. Teachers do not receive salaries or remuneration. At present, because the school does not have a large amount of production income, the county people's committee will allocate a portion of funds from the education funds to temporarily provide support. All the equipment of the university was allocated by the county normal school, and experimental machinery such as locomotive boilers and water pumps are also prepared to be temporarily borrowed from agricultural cooperatives.
    The rapid establishment of Xushui County University was decisively influenced by the Xushui County Party Committee taking the lead and the whole party mobilizing. After criticizing the superstitious idea of ​​not daring to interfere in running universities, the county party committee immediately assigned a secretary to be specifically responsible for planning and arranging. The party organizations of relevant departments such as the county party committee's culture and education department, the people's committee's education section, and the normal school also assigned cadres to be responsible for inviting teachers, recruiting students, and preparing sites and equipment, quickly completing various preparations for the establishment of the school.
    This university was established to meet the needs of production development. After Xushui County realized water conservancy last winter and this spring, it then drilled nearly a thousand machine wells, and established some hydropower stations and many biogas stations. It will soon realize the mechanization and electrification of irrigation and cultivation, but farmers lack the ability to use these new equipment and new technologies; at the same time, the county has also established many agricultural middle schools, and teachers are also very scarce. Based on the above situation, the Xushui County Party Committee quickly prepared to establish this university.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 15th. Following the establishment of three spare-time universities in Zhangzhou City, eight spare-time universities established by Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou and other cities and Putian County have also opened one after another. More than 3,000 people, including government officials, factory and enterprise employees, and administrative personnel from universities and middle schools, are studying in these eleven spare-time universities. After one or two years of spare-time study, the level of their main disciplines can be raised to the level of a university diploma.
    The presidents of these spare-time universities are the secretaries of the local municipal party committees, mayors, county party secretaries, and factory directors, and they hire teachers from nearby universities and middle school teachers with one or two decades of teaching experience. According to the needs of production and work, some of these spare-time universities are single-discipline and some are multi-disciplinary, and the courses include Marxist-Leninist theory, Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, foreign languages, factory and enterprise management, and educational administrative work. The relevant departments in Fuzhou City have also established a spare-time university office to strengthen organizational leadership.

### 破除迷信　放手办大学  徐水县立大学正式成立  福建又办八所业余大学

　　破除迷信　放手办大学
    徐水县立大学正式成立
    福建又办八所业余大学
    本报讯　经过短期的紧张筹备后，河北省徐水县立大学15日已正式成立。
    徐水县立大学现有学生和教职员一百七十多人，第一学期入学的一百五十名学生分两个班教学。其中的正规班除文理基础课程外，设有土壤、昆虫等六个学科，学生修业期限四年。这个班目前有学生四十多人，今后还将适当添设学科，增加学生。这个班的学生修业期满后，将由县主管机关分配在当地从事农业生产建设和农业科学研究。这个大学还附设一个农业中学师资训练班，这个班目前共有学员一百多人，学习内容主要是土壤改良、农业灌溉、合理施肥、锅驼机和煤气机的使用修理、水利和沼气发电等基本知识及操作技术。学生学习期满后由县介绍到农业中学去担任教师。
    这个大学现有副教授、讲师和助教九人，都是兼职，其中三人是县农业、畜牧、水利部门中曾在高等学校毕业并具备一定的生产经验的在职干部，另外六人是聘请的中国科学院、河北农学院等部门经常来徐水县作调查研究和实习教学的科学研究人员、教授和讲师。中共徐水县委确定了一名副书记担任校长。学校政治理论课的讲授也有党的负责干部兼任。学生是用就地抽选的办法招收的，一部分是具备初高级中学文化水平的在职干部和小学教师，另一部分是本县后期师范今年暑期即行毕业的文理科学生。学生的质量也很好。
    这个大学将根据勤工俭学的方针实行半工半读，生产和学习相结合。学校经费开支和学员生活费都用自己的生产收入来解决，教师都不拿薪金酬劳。目前，因为学校还没有大量的生产收入，县人民委员会将从教育经费中拨出一部分款项暂时予以支援。大学的一切设备都是本县师范筹拨的，锅驼机、水泵等试验机械也准备暂时向农业社借用。
    徐水县立大学能够迅速的办起来，中共徐水县委书记挂帅、全党动手起了决定性的作用，县委批判了不敢插手办大学的迷信思想后，即抽出一名书记专责筹划安排，县委文教部、人民委员会教育科、师范学校等有关部门的党组织也抽出干部来分头担任聘请教师、选收学生和筹备地址用具等工作，很快完成了建校的各种准备。
    这个大学是适应生产发展的需要建立的，徐水县去冬今春实现了水利化后，接着又打了近千眼机井，并建立了一些水电站和许多沼气站，不久就要实现灌溉耕作机械化和电气化，但农民都很缺乏使用这些新设备新技术的能力；同时这县还办了许多农业中学，教师也很缺少。根据上述情况，中共徐水县委才迅速筹办这个大学。
    新华社福州15日电　继漳州市举办三所业余大学之后，福州、厦门、泉州等市和莆田县举办的八所业余大学也已陆续开学。在这十一所业余大学学习的有机关干部、工厂企业职工和大中学校的行政人员等三千多人，他们在经过一、二年的业余学习后，主要学科的水平可以提高到大学专科水平。
    这些业余大学都由各地中共市委书记、市长、县委书记和工厂厂长担任校长，并聘请附近的大专学校的教师和有一、二十年教学经验的优秀的中学教师作教师。根据生产和工作需要，这几所业余大学有的是单科制，有的是多科综合，课程有马列主义理论、语文、数学、物理、化学、外语、工厂企业管理和教育行政工作等。福州市有关部门还专门设立业余大学办公室，加强组织领导工作。
