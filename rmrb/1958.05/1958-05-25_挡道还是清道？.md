    Obstacle or Paving the Way?
    The Pflimlin government has requested the French National Assembly to pass its draft amendment to the constitution. The main content of this draft is to reduce the role of the National Assembly and allow the government to monopolize power. According to Pflimlin, this will help block the path for De Gaulle to come to power.
    Can the road for fascists to come to power be blocked by restricting democratic rights? The answer is obviously no. Even Agence France-Presse had to admit in a news report that amending the constitution is essentially paving the way for De Gaulle to come to power. Because this will make the "constitutional government" in Paris not much different from the so-called "government of national salvation" demanded by the Algerian rebels, and De Gaulle can form a government through "normal" means.
    Since Agence France-Presse has seen this, the French people will certainly not fail to see it. What role Pflimlin is playing in the face of the fascist threat is something the French people should pay close attention to.

    挡道还是清道？
    弗林姆兰政府要求法国国民议会通过它的修改宪法的草案。这个草案的主要内容是，缩小国民议会的作用，而由政府来包揽大权。据弗林姆兰解释，这样做将有利于挡住戴高乐上台的道路。
    用限制民主权利的办法能够挡住法西斯上台的道路吗？答案显然是否定的。连“法新社”在一则新闻里也不得不承认，修改宪法实质上是为戴高乐上台扫清道路。因为，这将使巴黎的“宪法政府”和阿尔及利亚叛乱分子所要求的所谓“救国政府”没有多大区别，而戴高乐就可以通过“正常”的办法组织政府了。
    既然“法新社”看到了这一点，法国人民当然也不会看不到。弗林姆兰在法西斯威胁面前究竟充当什么角色，这是值得法国人民小心注意的。
