    Admitting Backwardness, Refusing to Lag Behind
    Zeng Zhi

    The development of things is unbalanced. In any place and in any work, there are advanced and backward elements. Being among the advanced is certainly a good thing and worth celebrating. However, being backward is not necessarily always a bad thing; it can be transformed from a bad thing into a good thing. The key lies in one's attitude towards backwardness: do you admit backwardness but refuse to be content with it, or do you admit backwardness and then simply accept it? If it is the former, the backward have the possibility of catching up with the advanced, and a bad thing can turn into a good thing; if it is the latter, then you can only go downhill, further and further away from the advanced.

    Advanced and backward are the results of comparison; they are objective facts. Not admitting it means not admitting objective facts. Generally speaking, it is easier to admit that you are advanced, but it is not so easy to admit that you are backward. Admitting backwardness means negating yourself and affirming that others are indeed better than you.

    Only by admitting backwardness can you see your own shortcomings, see the strengths of others, and only then is it possible to learn from their strengths to make up for your own weaknesses, and only then is it possible to eliminate backwardness and catch up with the advanced. However, admitting backwardness is only the first step, merely having the possibility of catching up with the advanced. To turn this possibility into reality requires further efforts. Therefore, admitting backwardness still requires refusing to be content with it. Only by refusing to be content with backwardness can you muster sufficient energy, strive for progress, and transform backwardness into advancement. In this regard, the Leading Group for Rectification in the Ministry of Railways is a good example.

    After the Ministry of Railways entered the third stage of the rectification campaign, whether during the period of extensive airing of views and debates, or the period of major rectification and reforms and in-depth rectification, it had always been a relatively advanced unit. However, recently, in the matter of being realistic and practical, compared with several advanced units, they have fallen behind. On April 18th, after the person in charge of the Ministry of Railways listened to the experience presentations on being realistic from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance, they immediately held discussions within the Leading Group for Rectification, admitting that they had fallen behind. But they were not content with backwardness, and put forward the slogan of "Admitting backwardness, refusing to be content with backwardness, mustering sufficient energy, and striving for progress," and then began to take action: organizing inspection teams for inspection, holding exhibitions, and so on.

    There are also some people who, when they see that others are indeed more advanced than themselves, although they can humbly admit that they are backward, do not regard admitting backwardness as a force to encourage themselves to catch up with the advanced, nor do they regard failure as the mother of success, and thus rise up to catch up. Instead, on the one hand, they admit backwardness, and on the other hand, they are depressed and dispirited, thinking, "Anyway, I'm already behind, I can't catch up, so let it go!" This situation, in common parlance, is called "losing heart." "Spirits can be encouraged, but not deflated." Once you lose heart, you naturally have no strength to catch up with the advanced, and you can only be content with the status quo and be content with backwardness.

    There are still some people whose situation is different from the previous two. They clearly know that they are backward, but they refuse to admit backwardness, and still want to pretend to be advanced, just like Ah Q clearly had ringworm on his head but was unwilling for people to call him "ringworm head." However, regardless of whether you admit it or not, whether you are willing or not, backwardness is still backwardness. To remove the label of backwardness, you can only do so when you have truly caught up with the advanced; and to transform backwardness into advancement, you must first admit backwardness. Only by admitting backwardness can you humbly learn from the advanced, and only then is it possible to catch up with the advanced.

    Therefore, if you are backward, the best way is to "Admit backwardness, refuse to be content with backwardness, muster sufficient energy, and strive for progress."

    承认落后，不甘落后
    曾志
    事物的发展是不平衡的，在任何地方、任何工作中都有先进与落后之分。名列先进，当然是件好事，值得高兴。但是，落后也不一定永远就是坏事，也可以由坏事变成好事。关键就在于自己对待落后的态度如何：是承认落后而不自甘落后呢，还是承认了落后就自甘落后？如果是前者，落后的就有可能赶上先进，坏事就会变成好事；如果是后者，那就只能走下坡路，离先进愈去愈远。
    先进与落后是对比的结果，是客观事实。不承认它，就是不承认客观事实。一般来说，要自己承认先进比较容易，要自己承认落后，就不那么容易了。承认落后，就意味着否定自己，肯定别人的确比自己高明。
    只有承认落后，才能看到自己的不足，看到别人的长处，才有可能取彼之长，补己之短，也才有可能消除落后赶上先进。不过，承认落后仅仅是第一步，仅仅是有了赶上先进的可能，要把这种可能变成现实，还需要作进一步的努力。因此，承认了落后还得不自甘落后。只有不自甘落后，才能鼓足干劲，力争上游，才能变落后为先进。在这方面，铁道部整风领导小组就是一个好榜样。
    铁道部在整风转入第三阶段以后，不论是大鸣大放还是大整大改和深入整改时期，一直是比较先进的单位，但是，最近在务虚务实的问题上，同几个先进单位比，他们却落后了。4月18日，铁道部的负责人在听了国家计划委员会和财政部务虚的经验介绍后，立即在整风领导小组内进行讨论，承认他们是落后了。但是他们不甘落后，提出了“承认落后，不甘落后，鼓足干劲，力争上游”的口号，接着就开始行动：组织检查组进行检查，举办展览会等等。
    另外有一些人，他们在看到别人确实比自己先进的时候，虽然也能虚心承认自己落后，但是不把承认落后当做激励自己赶上先进的一种力量，不是把失败看做成功之母，因而奋起直追迎头赶上，而是一方面承认落后，一方面心情沮丧、意志消沉，认为“反正已经落后了，赶也赶不上，随它去吧！”这种情况，用句通常的话说：就是“泄气”。“气可鼓而不可泄”，一泄了气，自然就没有力量赶上先进，也就只好安于现状、自甘落后了。
    还有一些人的情况，与前面两种情况都不同。他们明明知道自己落后了，但是硬不承认落后，还想假充先进，就像阿Q明明是癞痢头而偏偏不愿意人家叫他“癞痢头”一样。不过，不管承认不承认，愿意不愿意，落后终究还是落后。要摘掉落后的帽子，只有在你真正赶上了先进的时候；而要变落后为先进，首先还得承认落后。承认了落后，才能虚心向先进学习，才有可能赶上先进。
    因此，如果自己落后了，最好的办法便是“承认落后，不甘落后，鼓足干劲，力争上游”。
