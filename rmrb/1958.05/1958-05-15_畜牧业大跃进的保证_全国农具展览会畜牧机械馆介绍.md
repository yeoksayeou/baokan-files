Guaranteeing the Great Leap Forward in Animal Husbandry
——An Introduction to the Animal Husbandry Machinery Hall at the National Agricultural Implement Exhibition
By our reporter Jiang Qingzhao
    Entering the Animal Husbandry Machinery Hall, people are enthusiastically visiting over one hundred and sixty pieces of animal husbandry machinery. These new-style machines, coming from the vast countryside, factories, and grasslands of the motherland, shine with the infinite wisdom of the working people, interweaving into brilliant flowers of technological revolution in China's animal husbandry.
    In the Animal Husbandry Machinery Hall, people are first attracted by the simple, ingenious, and practical feed processing machinery.
    People deeply feel that it is no longer the era dominated by large choppers. Many farmers have used wood and waste materials to transform various chopping machines. Liu Darui of the Gaozhaoquan Agricultural Cooperative in Shen County, Hebei Province, successfully modified a chaff cutter using the flywheel of a calendering machine. Three people can chop more than 4,500 catties of grass per day. This chaff cutter can also be moved to the fields to drive a waterwheel for irrigation.
    The foot-operated shredder and slicer created by farmers in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province, is made entirely of wood except for the cutter and iron shaft. The structure is very simple. One person can cut 12,000 catties of livestock feed such as sweet potatoes and radishes in eight hours, increasing efficiency by 50 to 60 times compared to manual labor. The sweet potato shredder created by Zhang Shaohe of Kaiyuan County, Honghe Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is also welcomed and praised by visitors. It looks like a four-legged long stool. One person sits on the stool and steps on the left and right pedals. Working eight hours a day, they can cut more than 900 catties of potato feed, increasing efficiency by more than five times compared to manual labor. The slicer manufactured by Li Shusheng of Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, is modified using the large and small gears and rocker arm of a threshing machine. One person using it can slice 4,000 to 5,000 catties of potato feed per day, and the price is only five or six yuan.
    Workers in various places are enthusiastically concerned about and supporting the reform of animal husbandry technology, and have also manufactured a large number of machines with excellent performance for farmers and herdsmen. The "Chaff Cutter" manufactured by Nantong Machine Factory in Jiangsu Province produces evenly chopped fodder of uniform length. It can chop twelve different lengths of fodder according to the tastes of different livestock. Audiences love this machine, and its surroundings are often crowded with people every day.
    Many local factories and handicraft production cooperatives have also created various types of feed crushers according to the urgent needs of farmers to use substitutes to process livestock feed. For example, the hammer mill manufactured by Taizhou Iron Factory in Jiangsu Province, the force hammer mill created by Santai County People's Machinery Factory in Sichuan Province, the grinder mill created by Yexian Xinghua Iron Factory in Shandong Province, and the corn cob grinder created by Qiqihar Machine Iron Production Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province can all crush corn cobs, peanut shells, rice straw, etc. as fine as flour, and can produce hundreds to thousands of catties per hour. The cotton shell crushing five-purpose machine created by Xinxiang Agricultural Implement and Woodware Production Cooperative in Henan Province can crush cotton shells, peanut shells, grind rice flour, and also cut sweet potatoes, radishes, and potatoes into thin slices, shred them, and also process sweet potatoes and potatoes into starch. Most of its structure is wooden, the body is not large, and the use is light and convenient.
    Another part of the Animal Husbandry Machinery Hall is machinery generally more suitable for large grasslands and ranches. China has vast grasslands, with pastoral areas covering nearly four million square kilometers. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups are actively moving towards the cooperative and mechanized path of animal husbandry. Exhibited here are giant mowers, hay rakes, stackers, hay balers, and silage choppers. With these modern machines, it is possible to ensure the storage of perennial forage and feed for large herds of livestock and solve the difficulty of insufficient labor. Most of these large machines are manufactured by local factories, but many are also manufactured by herdsmen and local handicraft production cooperatives. The horse-drawn hay rake created by the Wuxing Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is operated by one person with two horses, and the hay raking area per hour can reach 10,000 square meters, which is 20 times more efficient than manual labor. A rotary mower created by Xinhua Woodware Cooperative in Guichi County, Anhui Province, is operated by one person sitting on it, and more than 10,000 catties of grass can be cut every day.
    Among the exhibits are also many exquisite and modern animal husbandry tools, such as milk separators, milking machines, artificial insemination devices, automatic shearing machines, and automatic drinkers. These things are very attractive to the general audience.

　　畜牧业大跃进的保证
　　——全国农具展览会畜牧机械馆介绍
    本报记者　姜庆肇
    走进畜牧机械馆，人们在这里兴致勃勃地参观了一百六十多件畜牧机械。这些来自祖国广大农村、工厂和草原上的新式机械，闪耀着劳动人民的无穷智慧，交炽成我国畜牧业技术革命的灿烂花朵。
    在畜牧机械馆里，人们首先被那些构造简单、灵巧适用的饲料加工机械所吸引。
    人们深深感到，现在已经不是用大铡刀为主的时代了。许多农民利用木料、废料改造了各种不同的铡草机械。河北省深县高赵圈农业社刘大瑞利用压花机的飞轮改制成功的一部铡草机，每天三个人可铡草四千五百多斤。这部铡草机还可搬到田地里，带动一部水车车水浇田。
    湖南省凤凰县农民创造的脚踏
    切丝切片机，除了切刀和铁轴以外，全是木质的，构造非常简单，一个人操作八小时就可切红薯、萝卜等牲畜饲料一万二千斤，比手工的效率提高五十到六十倍。受到观众欢迎和称赞的，还有云南省红河自治州开远县张绍河创造的薯类切丝机。它像个四脚长板凳，一个人坐在板凳上，双脚踩动着左右的踏板，一天工作八小时，就可切薯类饲料九百多斤，比手工效率提高五倍多。四川省永川县李述生制造的切片机，是用打谷机的大小齿和摇臂改造的。一个人使用它，每天可切薯类饲料四千到五千斤，而价格只需要五、六元。
    各地的工人们热情地关怀和支援着畜牧业技术的改革，也为农民和牧民们制造了大批的性能优良的机械。江苏省南通市机器厂制造的“铡草机”，铡出的饲草长短均匀，它可以按照大小牲畜的口味，铡十二种长短不一的饲草。观众们很喜爱这种机器，连日在它的周围常常挤满了人。
    许多地方工厂和手工业生产合作社还根据农民利用代用品加工牲畜饲料的迫切需要，创制了各式各样的饲料粉碎机。如江苏省泰州铁工厂制造的锤击式粉碎机，四川省三台县人民机器厂创造的劲锤式粉碎机，山东省掖县兴华铁工厂创造的磨式粉碎机和黑龙江省齐齐哈尔机铁生产合作社创造的玉米核粉碎机等，都能够把玉米核、花生壳、稻草等粉碎得像面粉一样细，并且在一个钟头内就可出产几百斤到上千斤。河南省新乡农具木器生产合作社创造的棉壳粉碎五用机，能粉碎棉壳、花生壳，磨米粉，也能把红薯、萝卜和马铃薯切成薄片、切成细丝，还能把红薯、马铃薯打成淀粉。它的构造大部分是木制的，体质不大，使用轻便。
    畜牧机械馆的另一部分，是一般较适用于大草原、牧场上的机械。我国有辽阔的草原，牧业区面积约近四百万平方公里。各族牧民正在积极地走向畜牧业合作化和机械化的道路。这里展览着巨型的割草机、打搂草机、垛草机、干草打捆机和青贮饲料切碎机。有了这些近代化的机械，就可以保证大群牲畜常年饲草和饲料的贮备，解决人工不足的困难。这些大型机械大部分是各地工厂制造的，但也有不少是牧民和地方手工业生产合作社制造的。内蒙古自治区五星牧业社创造的马拉搂草机，两匹马拉一人操作，每小时的搂草面积可达到一万平方公尺，比人工效率提高二十倍。安徽省贵池县新华木器社创造的一种旋转式割草机，一人坐在上面操作，每天割草一万多斤。
    展览品中还有许多精巧玲珑的现代化畜牧工具，如牛奶分离机、挤奶器、人工授精器、自动剪毛机和自动饮水器等。这些东西对广大观众都具有很大的吸引力。
