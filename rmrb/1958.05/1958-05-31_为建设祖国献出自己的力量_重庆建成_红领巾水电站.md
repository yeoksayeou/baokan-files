Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 30th. Chongqing's children are dedicating their efforts to building the motherland.

The children of Chongqing have long had this ideal: to use the income from their participation in the small Five-Year Plan activities to support agricultural cooperatives in building Young Pioneer Hydroelectric Stations and Young Pioneer Reservoirs. Starting last winter, they planted sunflowers and vegetables in corners of houses and roadsides, and collected orange peels, waste books and paper, and scrap copper and iron, accumulating their labor income, one cent at a time. Now, their ideal has been realized. They have used their accumulated money to build a Young Pioneer Hydroelectric Station and a Young Pioneer Reservoir. They have also cultivated a Young Pioneer Orchard on the edge of the reservoir of the hydroelectric station. Before the "June 1st" Children's Day, five more Young Pioneer Hydroelectric Stations will be completed and generating electricity throughout the city.

Within four months this year, the city's children have also collected more than 910,000 catties of scrap steel, and recently used this scrap steel to smelt the tenth furnace of "Youth Steel."

In eliminating the four pests and planting trees to protect forests, the children have played an even more active role. More than 100,000 children in the city have participated in "Hygiene Supervision Post" activities. The children also often help residents who are busy or lack labor to clean and arrange their rooms.

    为建设祖国献出自己的力量
    重庆建成“红领巾水电站”
    据新华社重庆30日电　重庆市少年儿童正在为建设祖国献出自己的一分力量。
    重庆市的少年儿童们早就有这样一个理想：要用自己开展小五年计划活动所得的收入，支援农业合作社建设红领巾水电站和红领巾水库。从去年冬天开始，他们就在屋角、路旁种植向日葵、蔬菜和收集橘柑皮、废书废纸、破铜烂铁等，把劳动所得的钱一角一分地积存起来。现在，他们的理想实现了，他们已经用积存的钱建成了一座红领巾水电站和红领巾水库。他们并在水电站的蓄水池上边，培植了一片红领巾果木林。“六一”儿童节以前，全市还有五座红领巾水电站要建成发电。
    全市少年儿童们在今年四个月内还拾到了九十一万多斤废钢铁，不久以前利用这些废钢铁已经炼出了第十炉“少年钢”。
    在除四害、植树护林等方面，少年儿童们更发挥了积极的作用。全市有十万多少年儿童参加了“卫生监督岗”的活动。孩子们还经常帮助事情忙和缺乏劳动力的居民打扫和布置房间。
