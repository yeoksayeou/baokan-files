Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: During the rectification movement, many medical workers stationed in the Nanjing Military Region proactively requested that their leaders organize large-scale collaborative scientific research efforts. According to the medical science research collaboration plan drafted by the Nanjing Military Region's health department, from late February to April 30th, the Nanjing Military Region General Hospital, the Ministry of Health's Institute of Inspection, three hospitals, and two military health battalions conducted the first phase of large-scale collaborative scientific research on the prevention and treatment of dysentery. These units unreservedly shared their case data and sent doctors to collectively analyze 1,800 cases in detail. They also fully debated issues such as the differentiation of various types of dysentery, various treatment methods, the efficacy of sulfaguanidine, and the criteria for cure, and reached a consensus. They then collectively wrote seventeen academic papers, preliminarily providing scientific arguments for the eradication of dysentery within the Nanjing Military Region in three to five years.
