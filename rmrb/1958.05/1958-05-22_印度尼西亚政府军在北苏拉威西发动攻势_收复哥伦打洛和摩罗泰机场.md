Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 21st: Indonesian Army authorities announced in a communique on the 21st that Indonesian government forces had recaptured the entire city of Gorontalo in North Sulawesi on May 20th. This city is approximately 225 kilometers southwest of Manado.

The communique stated that government forces seized a rebel ship during the battle, and more than 30 rebels surrendered with full arms, while the remaining rebels fled outside the city.

The communique said that the army, with the support of the air force, is continuing to mop up the rebels in Central Sulawesi.

The communique also stated that some of the captured rebel equipment and ammunition had Chinese markings. These were obviously supplies from the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Prior to this, the Indonesian Army Intelligence Office announced on the evening of the 20th that government forces had recaptured Morotai Airport in North Maluku on the afternoon of the 20th. Government paratroopers landed in Morotai on the morning of the 20th and joined forces with the armed forces of the Fifth Military Region and the marine corps that had landed along the coast. After defeating the rebel counterattack, government forces occupied Morotai Airport at 2:00 PM that day.

Before landing in Morotai, government forces shot down a rebel B-26 aircraft and captured two foreigners on board.

The above military operations confirm what Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution pointed out in his message to all officers and soldiers of the Indonesian armed forces on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Indonesian National Awakening Day, namely that government forces have launched an offensive against the rebel groups. This military offensive is a major blow to the American plot to use North Sulawesi as a base to utilize rebel groups to invade Maluku and other parts of East Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚政府军在北苏拉威西发动攻势
    收复哥伦打洛和摩罗泰机场
    据新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚陆军当局21日发表的公报说，印度尼西亚政府军在5月20日收复了北苏拉威西哥伦打洛全城，这个城离万鸦老西南大约二百二十五公里。
    公报说，政府军在这一战役中缴获叛军船只一艘，有叛军三十多人携带全副武装投诚，其余叛军逃亡城外。
    公报说，陆军在空军的支援下正在中苏拉威西继续扫荡叛军。
    公报还说，在缴获的叛军装备和军火中有些是带有中文标记的。这些显然是蒋介石集团的军需品。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚陆军情报处20日晚上宣布，政府军在20日下午收复了马鲁古北部的摩罗泰机场。政府军伞兵部队20日上午在摩罗泰降陆后，同第五军区的武装部队和在沿海登陆后的海军陆战队会了师。政府军在击溃了叛军的反攻以后在当天下午两点钟占领了摩罗泰机场。
    政府军在摩罗泰登陆以前，曾经击落了叛军的一架B—26型飞机，并捉到机上的两个外国人。
    上述军事行动证实了印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安在纪念印度尼西亚民族觉醒日五十周年时向印度尼西亚武装部队全体官兵发表的文告中所指出的，政府军已经对叛乱集团发动了进攻。这次军事进攻是对美国计划以北苏拉威西为基地利用叛乱集团来侵犯马鲁古和东印度尼西亚其他地区的阴谋的重大打击。
