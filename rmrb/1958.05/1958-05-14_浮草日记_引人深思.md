"Floating Weeds Diary" Provokes Deep Thought
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Feng Zi
    Anyone who has been in a theatrical troupe in the old society will naturally feel a sense of familiarity when watching "Floating Weeds Diary" today. Ichikawa Magogoro led a small troupe. Because of his love for and loyalty to art, in today's Japan, he and his troupe members are forced to live in dire straits. To survive, they have to sign a humiliating treaty with the capitalists, accept the expelled actor Kojinosuke back into the troupe to play the leading role, sell their adopted daughter to the capitalists, and perform burlesque shows. For the sake of his love for the theater, Magogoro endures a life of begging from the capitalists for food; however, when it comes to selling out the conscience of an artist, Magogoro would rather starve to death, or even disband the troupe, than do it.

    Some of the experiences of Magogoro and his troupe are not unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. Chinese theater has also reflected the lives of Chinese artists in the old society from different angles. "The Death of a Famous Actor," "Fang Zhenzhu," and Magogoro, although their social and historical backgrounds are not exactly the same, their fate of being "fellow sufferers in a fallen world" was determined by the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. In Magogoro and his troupe members, we see more of the shadows of opera and drama workers who struggled and fought through the old society.

    "Floating Weeds Diary" not only exposes the darkness of society and reflects the reality of the lives of Kabuki artists in Japan today, but the screenwriter and director also raise the question of who should dramatic art serve through the Magogoro troupe, and also solve the question of who it should serve. The Magogoro troupe has reached the end of its rope, and Magogoro himself has fallen ill. It seems that the only way out for this group is to disband. They came to the industrial and mining area, where the workers are on strike. However, the Kabuki actors, who are also oppressed, have no understanding of the essence of such a class society where people eat people, and instead blame the workers for going on strike for "making trouble out of nothing." However, in this desperate situation, the workers themselves, even though they are hungry, give the Magogoro troupe material and spiritual support, and share their meager rations. This support revives the Magogoro troupe actors. In particular, the performance of a play organized by the trade union to mobilize the families of the workers to persist in the strike, in which Kabuki, which had always performed ancient legends of heroes, suddenly had to perform a modern play with the theme of vivid class struggle, was a great struggle and a great revolution; however, artistic practice proved a truth: plays that faithfully reflect the struggle of the working people will definitely be loved and welcomed by the working people. Magogoro said it well: "The cheers of the audience made me feel on stage that I was playing a real hero." Times have changed, and in the people's century, the working people should of course be the heroes on stage today. The screenwriters and directors of "Floating Weeds Diary" clearly raised an important issue in artistic creation, and the fact that this issue was raised so forcefully also points out the positivity of the theme of the film "Floating Weeds Diary." I think this should be the most successful aspect of the film, and it is also worthy of our deep thought and study.

    I had a brief meeting with the author, Ms. Mayama Miho, when she came to Beijing. She mentioned this work to me. I didn't expect to see this film before seeing her performance in person. Mr. Yamamoto Satsuo's direction is familiar to us, and the success of the film shows the seamless cooperation between the screenwriter and director in artistic creation. At the same time, each actor also has his or her own unique way of portraying the characters.

　　“浮草日记”引人深思
　　凤子
    凡是在旧社会剧团呆过的人，今天来看“浮草日记”，自然会有亲切之感。市川马五郎领导了一个人数不多的剧团。因为他热爱和忠实于艺术，在今天的日本，他和他的剧团同人就被逼得活不下去。要活下去，就得同资本家订城下之盟，接受被开除的演员幸之助回团演主角，出卖寄女给资本家，演大腿戏。为了爱戏，马五郎忍受了像乞丐一样地向资方讨口饭吃的生活；可是，要出卖艺术家的良心，马五郎宁可饿死，甚至剧团散伙，也绝不干。
    马五郎和他的剧团所经历的一些生活，对中国观众说来也不是陌生的，中国舞台上也曾不同角度地反映过中国艺人在旧社会的生活，“名优之死”、“方珍珠”和马五郎，虽然他们所处的社会和时代背景不尽相同，但是，在半封建半殖民地的社会决定了他们的“同是天涯沦落人”的命运；在马五郎和他的剧团同人们的身上，我们更多的看到在旧社会挣扎和斗争过来的戏曲艺人和话剧工作者们的影子。
    “浮草日记”不只是暴露社会黑暗和反映今天日本歌舞伎艺人的生活真实，编剧和导演通过马五郎剧团提出了戏剧艺术为谁服务的问题，也解决了应该为谁服务这个问题。马五郎剧团已经到了山穷水尽的地步了，马五郎本人也病倒了，眼看这个团体只有解散的一条路了。他们来到工矿区，工人正在罢工，同是受压迫的歌舞伎演员们却对这样一个人吃人的阶级社会的本质毫无认识，反而责怪工人罢工是“没事找事”。可是，就在这个绝境里，工人们自己饿着肚子却给予马五郎剧团物质的和精神的支援，分出自己仅有的一点口粮。这一支援，使得马五郎剧团演员们苏生了。尤其是在工会组织下演出了一场动员工人家属坚持罢工的戏，一贯演古代传说中的英雄故事的歌舞伎，一变而要演出活生生的阶级斗争题材的现代戏，这是一个大的斗争，大的革命；可是艺术实践证明了一条真理：忠实地反映劳动人民斗争生活的戏，一定会受到劳动人民的热爱和欢迎的。马五郎说的好：“观众的欢呼，使我在台上感到我扮演的是一个真正的英雄。”时代不同了，人民的世纪里，劳动人民当然应该是今天舞台上的英雄，“浮草日记”的编导者明确地提出了艺术创造上的重要问题，这个问题提得如此有力，也就点出了“浮草日记”这部影片主题的积极性，我觉得这应该是本片最成功的一方面。也是值得我们深思、学习的。
    作者真山美保女士来北京时曾匆匆会晤过，她向我提到过她这部作品，不想未看到她本人的演出而先看到这部影片了。山本萨夫先生的导演是我们熟悉的，影片的成功说明编剧导演在艺术创造上的合作无间，同时每一位演员在人物的刻划上也都有独到之处。
