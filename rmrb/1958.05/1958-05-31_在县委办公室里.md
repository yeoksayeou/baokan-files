    In the County Committee Office
    Yu Xiang
    He is both the County Committee Secretary and an Ordinary Farmer
    The office of the CCP Hunan Province Liuyang County Committee had long since moved to the countryside.
    On April 3rd, we made a special trip to visit this office. After walking about five or six *li*, Comrade Qi Shenwang, the First Secretary of the County Committee who accompanied us, pointed to a paddy field ahead and said, "We're here, this is the County Committee's experimental field." Following his hand, we saw rice seedlings that were dark, lush, and neatly arranged, resembling a beautiful carpet. In the field, three or five people were bending over to apply fertilizer. As we approached the edge of the field, one person straightened up and walked towards us. This person was dressed in farmer's clothes, with a shaved head and bare feet, trousers rolled up above the knees, legs covered in mud, and hands also covered in manure. He was none other than Comrade Shi Weigang, the Second Secretary of the County Committee. He washed his hands in the ditch beside the rice paddy and then led us to the office.
    The office was located opposite the paddy field, across a road. The facilities inside were very simple, the ground was extremely damp, and in some places, a pit would appear if you stepped on it. The office had a total of seven people, led by Comrade Shi Weigang. In addition to handling daily work, a large part of their time was spent participating in physical labor, cultivating the experimental field. Comrade Shi Weigang was outstanding in his labor. Before transplanting the rice seedlings, he transported fertilizer to the field from eight *li* away, carrying 800 *jin* at a time, making four round trips a day, a total of sixty-four *li*. During the transplanting, he could earn up to fifteen work points a day, exceeding the average farmer in the area.
    Through the experimental field and physical labor, the County Committee constantly maintained a clear head. Comrade Shi Weigang said: "In the past, our work often floated on the surface, relying on reports. Many cadres also had a superficial understanding of production, and many ridiculous things happened during work reports." People gave these cadres a nickname, calling them "empty-hearted windbags." Now, the situation has completely changed. Whether it's transplanting, fertilizing, or preventing and controlling pests and diseases, we first try it out in the experimental field, identify problems, and then study solutions before promoting them comprehensively. For example, high-density planting is being promoted throughout the county for the first time this year. During transplanting, we found that there were many large clods of mud in the field, and the seedlings were easily killed when planted on the clods. This meant that we couldn't guarantee a rich harvest for every plant. Therefore, we experimented in the field ourselves, exploring the method of "three plows, seven harrows, and rolling with a *dai pu* roller," and promoted it throughout the county in a timely manner. Comrade Shi Weigang said meaningfully: "If we want to keep the leadership in our hands, we must learn something!"
    He is both a Politician and a Scientist
    While we were talking, a person came in with a rubber tube, saying that there was still a section of line missing and asking for instructions on what to do. From their conversation, we learned that their biogas experiment had been successful, and the County Committee office would be lighting biogas lamps that evening.
    Our attention quickly turned to the biogas, and we asked to visit the site. The on-site equipment was very simple: a pool of about four or five square meters, filled with cow dung and sealed on top. A gasoline drum stood next to the pool, with a rubber tube connecting it to the pool, and biogas entered the drum through the tube.
    Their biogas experiment was not solely for lighting. During the Great Leap Forward in Production, the County Committee put forward the slogan of afforesting the mountains. However, the main fuel for farmers' cooking was wood, which conflicted with the afforestation of the mountains. In order to solve this contradiction, the County Committee proposed that every township and commune should develop biogas. However, biogas was just something they had heard of and seen in newspapers, and no one had practical experience. Comrade Shi Weigang heard that there was someone in the county who had studied biogas, so he tried to find this person and personally "went into the water" to lead everyone in the experiment. They built the pool, filled it with cow dung, and waited quietly for the biogas to arrive. But ten days later, when the outside temperature had reached over twenty degrees Celsius, the pool was only twelve degrees. Was there a leak? After carefully checking the pool, there was none. They researched and pondered, but couldn't find the cause. Later, they heard that the place was originally a lime pond, which affected the fermentation of cow dung. They then used scrap iron to make a curved tube that passed through the pool, and then injected hot water. This quickly raised the temperature. A large amount of biogas spurted out along the rubber tube, and when ignited, produced long flames. At this moment, everyone's faces showed a smile of victory.
    After the biogas experiment was successful, six townships had sent people to visit the site, and some townships had also started experimenting. Comrade Shi Weigang told us: "Recently, we plan to write a booklet based on our own practical experience, designate someone to write it, and send it to each township so that they have something to follow. We plan to have biogas lamps in every commune by autumn this year!"
    What is admirable is not only this. Here, there are also goats from Europe and sheep from Xuzhou, as well as Angora rabbits from other places and local livestock. They all live in houses built by their owners, clean and comfortable. Comrade Shi Weigang said interestingly: "Local ewes are cheap, only ten *yuan* each, but the disadvantage is that they don't produce milk; European ewes produce milk, but including freight, they cost about three hundred *yuan* each. We want to cross northern rams with local ewes so that their offspring can both produce milk and provide us with a large amount of excellent wool!" The same is true for rabbits. Local rabbits have short, stiff fur, which can be compensated for by crossing them with Angora bucks.
  Bold Ideals, Beautiful Wishes
    After the visit, we returned to the office. In a casual conversation, Comrade Qi Shenwang talked about his ideas for the future of Liuyang. He said: In March, he led comrades from the County Committee's mobile office to Shuijia Commune to help them with planning. In the planning, they found that if the dry land there was well utilized, it would generate more income than paddy fields. For example, planting fruit trees and tea trees could generate at least two hundred *yuan* per *mu* per year, while paddy fields, even with a yield of 1,000 *jin* per *mu*, would only generate sixty *yuan*. From this, he also thought of the entire mountainous area. The county has 5.2 million *mu* of mountainous land, of which 1 million *mu* have a slope of less than 30 degrees. If 300,000 *mu* are terraced and planted with tea trees, and 700,000 *mu* are planted with fruit trees, the annual income would be 200 million *yuan*. At the same time, mountainous areas with slopes of 30 to 60 degrees can be used as economic forest areas, and those above 60 degrees can be used as timber forest areas.... The more he thought about it, the more confident he became, and a beautiful picture of the mountainous area was displayed before his eyes.
    In order to realize this beautiful wish, he has begun to study scientific knowledge related to fruit trees. He bought the Collected Works of Michurin, Fruit Tree Cultivation, and also bought Botany. He has already finished reading Botany, and has read most of the others. Originally, Comrade Qi Shenwang had only studied for half a year, and although his cultural level has improved, he still has difficulties reading. Whenever he encounters difficulties, he asks technicians for advice and goes to the field to experiment and solve them. Now, he has hybridized the Suhong, Nanfeng, and Pomelo orange varieties, and is preparing to further experiment with cross-species hybridization. He said: "I haven't seen cross-species hybridization in Michurin's books, but I am confident myself. I hope the leadership will not transfer my work, and let me work here for ten years, I must experiment and get a result."
    Finally, Comrade Qi Shenwang told us that they had also thought about other aspects. If everything can be realized, by 1962, the average annual income per person will reach more than 1,100 *yuan*. By then, Liuyang will be "mountains green, waters clear, scenery beautiful, and happy days will last forever!" (Attached picture)

    在县委办公室里
    于湘
    是县委书记，也是普通农民
    中共湖南省浏阳县委会的办公室，早就搬到乡下去了。
    4月3日，我们特地去参观了这个办公室。约走了五六里地，陪同我们的县委第一书记齐身旺同志，指着前面的一丘田说：“到了，这就是县委会的试验田。”顺着他的手望去，禾苗乌黑，茁壮整齐，宛似一张美丽的地毯。田间，三五人正在弯着腰施肥。快到田边时，一个人直起腰来，向我们走来。这人，身着农民衣服，光头赤脚，裤子卷到膝盖以上，腿上全是泥巴，两只手也沾满了粪。他，就是县委第二书记石维刚同志。在稻田边的水沟里，他洗了一下手，就领我们到办公室里去。
    办公室位于稻田的对面，穿过一条马路就到了。里面设备很简单，地下极为潮湿，有的地方用脚一踩，便出现一个坑。办公室共有七人，由石维刚同志领导。他们除了处理日常工作外，很大一部分时间都是参加体力劳动，种试验田。在劳动上，石维刚同志是出色的。插秧前，他从八里地以外的地方往田里运肥，一次拉八百斤，一天来往四次，共六十四里。插秧时，他最多每天能挣到十五个工分，超过了当地的一般农民。
    通过试验田，通过体力劳动，使县委经常保持着清醒的头脑。石维刚同志说：过去搞工作，常常是漂浮在上面，靠汇报办事。很多干部对生产也是一知半解，汇报工作时，出了不少笑话。人们给这些干部送了个绰号，叫“空心牛皮”。现在，情况完全变了。不管是插秧、施肥、防治病虫害，我们都通过试验田先试一下，发现问题，即研究解决的办法，再全面推广。比如高度密植，今年是第一次在全县范围内推广。在插秧时，我们发现田里有许多较大的泥巴，秧苗要插在泥巴上，很容易死掉。这样，就不能保证蔸蔸丰收。于是，我们就自己在田里试验，摸索出“三犁，七耙，带浦滚”的办法，及时在全县范围内推广。石维刚同志意味深长地说：“要想把领导权掌握在我们手里，非学点东西不可！”
    是政治家，也是科学家
    正谈话时，一个人拿着一根橡皮管走了进来，说是还差一段线路，请示怎么办。从他们的对话中，才知道他们试验沼气已经成功，当晚县委办公室就要点沼气灯了。
    我们的注意力，很快集中在沼气上面，并要求到现场参观一下。现场设备很简单：一个大约四五平方公尺的池子，里面堆满了牛粪，上面密封起来。池子旁边立着一个汽油筒，一根橡皮管连结到池子里面，沼气就通过管子进入筒内。
    他们试验沼气，并不是完全为了照亮。在生产大跃进中，县委提出了绿化山区的口号。但农民做饭时的主要燃料是木材，这就和绿化山区有了矛盾。为了解决这一矛盾，县委便提出要乡乡社社搞沼气。但沼气这玩艺儿，只是听说过，在报纸上看到过，谁也没有实践经验。石维刚同志听说本县有一个研究过沼气的人，他就设法将这个人找来，又亲自“下水”，领导大家进行试验。他们砌好了池子，装进去了牛粪，便静等着沼气的到来。但十天以后，外边的温度已达二十度以上，池子里才只有十二度。跑汽了吗？仔细检查一下池子，一点也没有。左研究，右琢磨，怎么也找不出原因。后来，才听说这个地方原来是石灰塘，对牛粪的发酵有影响。他们便利用废铁片，制了一个弯曲的管子，使管子穿过池内，然后注入热水。这样，温度很快便上升了。大量的沼气，顺着橡皮管喷出，用火燃烧，就发出长长的火苗。这时，每个人的脸上都露出了胜利的笑容。
    沼气试验成功后，已有六个乡派人来现场参观，有些乡也开始试验了。石维刚同志告诉我们：“最近，便准备根据自己的实践经验，指定专人写一本小册子，发到各乡去，使他们有所遵循。计划在今年秋季，社社都有沼气灯！”
    令人钦佩的还不只这些。这里，还有来自欧洲的山羊和徐州的绵羊，也有来自外地的安哥拉兔子和本地的牲畜。它们，都住在主人亲自为它们建造的房子里，清洁而舒适。石维刚同志说得很有趣：本地的母羊便宜，每只仅十元，缺点是不会下奶；来自欧洲的母羊虽会下奶，但连运费在内，每只却需三百元左右。我们要使北方的公羊和本地的母羊杂交，使它们的下代既能产奶，又能供给我们大量的、出色的羊毛！关于兔子，也是这样。本地的兔子毛短且硬，若和安哥拉公兔杂交后，即可弥补这一缺陷。
  大胆的理想，美丽的愿望
    参观后，我们回到了办公室。闲聊中，齐身旺同志谈到了他关于未来浏阳的想法。他说：3月间，他带领县委流动办公室的同志，到水佳社帮助他们搞规划。在规划中，发现那里的旱地若很好地利用起来，比水田收入还要多。比如，栽上果树和茶树，每亩每年至少可收入两百元，而水田若以亩产千斤计算，也不过只有六十元。由此，他又联想到整个山区。全县山地面积有五百二十万亩，其中坡度在三十度以下的有一百万亩，若把它修成梯土三十万亩种上茶树，七十万亩种上果树，每年就可收入两亿元。同时，坡度在三十度到六十度的山区，还可作为经济林区，六十度以上的，可作为用材林区……。他越想越有信心，一幅美丽的山区图画，顿时展现在他的眼前。
    为了实现这一美好的愿望，他已开始钻研有关果木方面的科学知识。他买了米丘林选集，果树栽培学，还买了植物学。植物学已经读完，其他也读了大半。原先，齐身旺同志只读过半年书，现在文化水平虽有提高，读起来仍有困难。困难一来，他就向技术员请教，并到现场中去试验解决。现在，他已使苏红、南丰、柚子等橘种杂交起来，并准备进一步试验异性杂交。他说：“异性杂交，在米丘林的书上还没看到，不过我自己是有信心的。希望领导上不要调动我的工作，在这里干它十年，一定要试验出一个结果来。”
    最后，齐身旺同志告诉我们，别的方面他们也想了一下。若能全部实现，到1962年，平均每人每年的收入，即可达一千一百元以上。到那时，浏阳将是“山青水秀风光好，幸福日子万年长！”（附图片）
