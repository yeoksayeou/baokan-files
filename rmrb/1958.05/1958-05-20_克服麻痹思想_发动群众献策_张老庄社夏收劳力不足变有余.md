Overcoming Complacency, Mobilizing the Masses to Offer Suggestions
　　Zhanglaozhuang Cooperative Transforms Labor Shortage into Surplus During Summer Harvest

(Our report) The Zhanglaozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xixian County, Henan Province, has over 6,200 mu of summer harvest tasks and over 5,800 mu of summer planting, requiring a total of more than 32,000 labor days. However, the entire cooperative has only over 1,100 laborers, and it is estimated that there will be a shortage of more than 15,000 labor days and 378 animal power days. The contradiction of few laborers and heavy tasks was clearly presented. However, by early May, some cadres and masses believed that it was still early for the summer harvest and planting, and that the cooperative was large and had many people, so no preparations were needed. Not only were no new tools added, but even the old broken carts and forks were not repaired. The Zhanglaozhuang Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, under the specific leadership of the higher-level Party committee, organized all cooperative members to conduct a mass airing of views on whether early harvest and planting were good and what to do if there was a labor shortage. After four days and nights of airing, more than 6,900 big-character posters were posted, with more than 21,000 opinions. On the basis of thorough airing, a nationwide mass investigation and debate was organized. At the debate and investigation meeting, people naturally recalled the lessons of the past. Last year, the wheat was not harvested at 80% maturity as instructed by the higher authorities, but was waited for until it was fully ripe. As a result, a strong wind blew and more than 10,000 jin of grain was lost. Last year, because there were few people and the harvest was rough, the cooperative lost more than 20,000 jin. Through this calculation, a total of more than 85,000 jin of wheat was lost in the past two wheat seasons. Last year, 650 mu of rice in the cooperative were planted late. Compared with ordinary rice, each mu yielded 180 jin less, totaling about 120,000 jin of rice less. The cooperative organized an exhibition of these losses and the methods and resolutions offered by the members, and organized the masses to visit. After seeing it, all members were greatly educated and immediately boosted their enthusiasm. On the basis of raising awareness, they demanded that the harvesting be completed in three days, the threshing in four days, and the planting in eight days, and launched a campaign to contribute ideas and suggestions. The members put forward more than 4,000 methods, which can be summarized into the following nine items. 1. Break the routine of sending manure after the wheat harvest and send the manure to the fields before the wheat is harvested; 2. Accumulate fertilizer in advance, using local materials, and accumulate fertilizer in the fields. 3. Improve tools. Convert 17 Liberation waterwheels into oil-pressing waterwheels, increasing efficiency fourfold for each wheel; convert 13 wooden waterwheels into dragon-bone waterwheels with ball bearings, increasing efficiency by onefold; add wooden waterwheels to replace water buckets; add ball bearings to more than 180 small carts, increasing efficiency by onefold; modify 60 stone rollers. 4. Organize socialist large-scale cooperation. Labor from late-maturing areas first supports early-maturing areas on high ground. After the high ground is harvested, it supports low-lying areas. 5. Contract wheat harvesting to individuals to improve efficiency. 6. Everything is arranged, and life is planned. Commercial departments deliver goods to the countryside to reduce trips to the market. 7. Do a good job in managing early autumn crops in advance to ensure that the crops will not be damaged even if they are not managed for 20 days during the harvest and planting season. 8. Organize farm busy season canteens and nurseries. 9. Use all possible forces to organize students and people with mild labor capacity to participate in the summer harvest and planting. In addition to solving the shortage of more than 15,000 labor days, these measures will also save more than 10,000 labor days. More than 1,700 animal power days will also be saved. Now they have been organized and have begun to take action to ensure that the summer harvest and planting tasks are completed on time with guaranteed quality and quantity.

    克服麻痹思想　发动群众献策
　　张老庄社夏收劳力不足变有余
    本报讯　河南省息县张老庄农业社，今年夏收任务有六千二百多亩，夏种五千八百多亩，共需要劳动日三万二千多个。但全社只有一千一百多个劳力，估计要缺少一万五千多个劳动日，三百七十八个畜力。劳力少任务重的矛盾，就明显的摆出来了。但到5月上旬，有一部分干部和群众认为离夏收夏种还早，社大人多，不需要什么准备。不但没添置什么新工具，而且连过去坏的小车、杈子等也没有修理。中共张老庄支部，在上级党委的具体领导下，组织全体社员就早收早种好不好？劳力不够怎么办？展开全社性的大鸣大放，经过四个昼夜的鸣放，贴出大字报六千九百多张，意见二万一千多条。在鸣深放透的基础上，组织一个全民性的大查、大辩。在辩论查算的会上，人们很自然地回忆起过去的教训。去年，没有按照上级八成熟就收麦的指示，等着熟透，结果刮了一场大风，少收粮一万多斤。去年因为人少收的粗糙，全社少收两万多斤。通过这一算，过去两个麦季共损失麦八万五千多斤。去年，全社有六百五十亩稻种得晚了，与一般稻相比，每亩少收一百八十斤，共约少收十二万斤稻谷。社里把这些损失事实和社员献出的办法和决心，组织了展览会，组织群众参观。全体社员看了以后，受到很大教育，立即鼓起了干劲。在提高认识的基础上，以三天收完，四天打完，八天种完的要求，并开展了献计、献策运动，社员们提出四千多条办法，综合起来分为以下九项。一、打破收麦后送粪的常规，在小麦收割前把粪送到地头；二、提前积肥，就地取材，地头积肥。三、改良工具。把十七辆解放水车改轧油水车，改后每辆提高工效四倍，十三辆木水车改龙骨水车加滚珠，提高工效一倍，添置木水车代替戽水斗，一百八十多把小车加滚珠，提高工效一倍，改石磙六十个。四、组织社会主义大协作，晚熟地区劳力首先支援高地早熟地区，高地收完后，再支援洼地。五、割麦包给个人提高工效。六、事事有安排，生活有打算，商业部门送货下乡，减少赶集。七、提前做好早秋作物管理，保证收种时二十天不管理，作物也不受损害。八、组织农忙食堂和托儿所。九、利用可能利用的力量，组织学生和有轻微劳动力的人投入夏收夏种。以上这些措施除解决缺少的劳动日一万五千多个以外，还结余劳动日一万多个。畜力工也节余一千七百多个。现在他们已经组织起来，开始行动，保证按质、按量适时完成夏收夏种任务。
