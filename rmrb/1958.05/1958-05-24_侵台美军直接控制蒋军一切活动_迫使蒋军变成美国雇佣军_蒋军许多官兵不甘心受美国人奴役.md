Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Taipei Dispatch - The United States is currently beginning to reorganize the Chiang Kai-shek troops, forcing them to become completely American mercenaries, with all actions of the Chiang troops being directly controlled by Americans.

To achieve this conspiracy, not long ago, the United States merged seventeen different affiliated aggressive institutions stationed in Taiwan, such as the "United States Military Assistance Advisory Group" and the "United States Taiwan Defense Command," into the "United States Taiwan Defense Command - Military Assistance Advisory Group Headquarters." The commander-in-chief of this new institution, Doyle, serves as the supreme commander of the US military and Chiang troops in the Taiwan region. The activities of American military advisors have extended to all grassroots units of the Chiang Kai-shek army, navy, and air force. Currently, all of the Chiang Kai-shek troops' transfers, appointments, removals, promotions, demotions of officers above the intermediate level, as well as troop training, exercises, and military supplies, must be approved by American advisors; the activities of Chiang Kai-shek warships and the use of ammunition and fuel must also be decided by American advisors. The US aggressor troops also have representatives stationed in the General Political Department of the Chiang Kai-shek army. Recently, when the Chiang Kai-shek army held an all-army political work conference, the US aggressor Taiwan commander Doyle and deputy commander Bowen also attended the meeting, gesticulating and giving orders. In order to further divide from within and tighten control over the Chiang Kai-shek army, the US military authorities in Taiwan are making every effort to penetrate the political work organs of the Chiang Kai-shek army in an all-round way. At the same time, the United States has also sent a large number of so-called "psychologists" and "experts" to foster pro-American forces in the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and has selected a large number of officers above the rank of major from the Chiang Kai-shek troops to go to the United States for training.

All military facilities in Taiwan are also manipulated by the Americans. The US military is now stepping up the construction of missile bases in Tainan, expanding the Kaohsiung military port, and is building the Taichung Kungkuan Airport at a cost of 25 million US dollars. When this airport is completed, it can be used by jets and strategic bombers.

Many officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army are extremely dissatisfied with these frenzied aggressive activities of the United States, and they are unwilling to be enslaved by Americans. In Taiwan, incidents of conflicts between the Chiang Kai-shek army and American advisors often occur, and incidents of beating and killing American military personnel are also often heard. Near many barracks of the Chiang Kai-shek army, slogans and leaflets such as "Down with the unreasonable Americans" and "We are unwilling to sell our lives for America" are often found, and some slogans are even posted on the walls of US military clubs and American advisors' residences.

    侵台美军直接控制蒋军一切活动
    迫使蒋军变成美国雇佣军
    蒋军许多官兵不甘心受美国人奴役
    新华社23日讯　台北消息，美国目前正在开始改编蒋军部队，迫使蒋军完全成为美国的雇佣军，蒋军一切行动都由美国人直接控制。
    为了实现这一阴谋，不久以前，美国已经把派驻在台湾的“美国军事援助顾问团”、“美国台湾防御司令部”等十七个不同统属的侵略机构，合并成为“美国台湾防卫司令部——军事援助顾问团总部”。这个新机构的总司令道伊尔，作为台湾地区的美军和蒋军的最高指挥官。美国军事顾问人员的活动已经伸展到蒋军陆、海、空军的各个基层单位。目前，举凡蒋军的调遣，中级以上军官的任免、晋级、降级，以及部队的训练、演习、军需供应等，都要经过美国顾问的同意或批准；蒋军舰艇的活动和弹药、油料等的动用，也要美国顾问作主。美国侵略军还在蒋军总政治部派有代表。最近，蒋军召开全军政工会议，美国侵略台湾司令道伊尔和副司令鲍恩等人，也到会上指手划脚、发号施令。为了进一步从内部分化和加紧对蒋军的控制，侵台美军当局正在千方百计地活动，企图全面打入蒋军的政工机构。与此同时，美国还派了大批的所谓“心理学家”和“专家”，在蒋军部队中扶植亲美势力，并且从蒋军部队中选调大批的校级以上军官，到美国去受训。
    台湾的一切军事设施也被美国人操纵。现在美军正加紧在台南建筑导弹基地，扩建高雄军港，并且以二千五百万美元在建筑台中公馆机场。这个机场建成后，可供喷气机和战略轰炸机使用。
  蒋军许多官兵对美国这些疯狂的侵略活动极为不满，他们不甘心受美国人的奴役。在台湾，经常发生蒋军与美国顾问冲突的事件，殴打和枪杀美国军事人员的事也时有所闻。在蒋军许多兵营附近时常发现“打倒蛮不讲理的美国佬”、“我们不愿为美国卖命”等标语传单，有的标语还贴在美军俱乐部和美国顾问住宅的墙壁上。
