Motorcycle sports are well-known at Chongqing University in Chongqing. They started their first motorcycle training class in 1955 and have now held nine sessions, training more than 500 motorcyclists. More than 20 of these athletes can perform skills such as crossing single-plank bridges, seesaws, concealed driving, two-person exchange, and jumping through fire hoops. In the Chongqing City college motorcycle skills competition, they almost always took the top six places.

In 1956, Chongqing University established a motorcycle sports team, and the athletes often perform at sports events in Chongqing. They have also driven long distances to Chengdu and Guiyang to give demonstration performances, which were warmly welcomed by the local people. In Sichuan and Guizhou, people know about the motorcycle sports at Chongqing University. They not only study hard and practice diligently themselves, but also actively help other units to develop this sport. They often go to colleges and universities and some grassroots units in Chongqing to provide guidance.

    重庆大学的摩托车运动在重庆市是有名的。他们自1955年开始办第一期摩托车训练班，到现在已办了九期，共训练了五百多名摩托手。其中有二十多名运动员可以作过独木桥、翘翘板，隐蔽驾驶、双人互换、钻火圈等技巧表演。在重庆市大专学校摩托车技巧比赛中，他们几乎包办了前六名。
    1956年，重庆大学成立了一个摩托运动队，运动员们经常在重庆市的运动会上作表演。他们并曾长途驾驶到成都和贵阳去作示范表演，受到当地的热烈欢迎。在四川和贵州一带，人们都知道重庆大学的摩托车运动。他们不仅自己勤学苦练，并且积极帮助别的单位开展这项运动。他们常到重庆的大专学校和一些基层单位去辅导。
