    Trade Unions of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany Jointly Issue Statement
    Opposing West German Atomic Rearmament
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th - According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on the 9th, representatives of trade unions from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic adopted a statement at a joint conference held in Warsaw. The statement said that, under the current circumstances, the struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace is the most important task of the trade unions.
    The statement believes that the decision of the West German Federal Parliament to equip the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, the preparations to build rocket launch sites in West Germany, the legalization of Hitler's military organizations, and many other measures to revive fascism are serious threats to peace in Europe.
    The trade unions of the three countries welcome the decision of the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany in April this year. The trade unions of the three countries demand the adoption of the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately cease atomic weapon tests by member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to unconditionally prohibit the use of all kinds of atomic weapons, demand the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, the implementation of universal disarmament, the removal of military bases in various countries, and the establishment of an effective security system in Europe.
    The trade unions of the three countries call on the West German Trade Union Federation to unite all the forces of the German working class and trade unions to fight against militarism and to safeguard peace, and express their readiness to immediately establish contacts and friendly cooperation with trade unions in West Germany.
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th - According to a report by the German News Agency, 20,000 citizens held a rally in Karlsruhe, West Germany, on the 10th to protest against equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. The propaganda posters and slogans they held aloft read: "Oppose Atomic Armament!" "Throw Away Karlsruhe's Rockets!" "Karlsruhe Must Not Become Hiroshima!"
    Martin Niemöller, President of the Evangelical Church in Germany, Veit, Minister of Economy of Baden-Württemberg (Social Democrat), and Werner, a member of the Social Democratic Party in the West German Federal Parliament, all spoke at the mass meeting, calling for a struggle against the policy of implementing atomic armament in West Germany.

    据新华社华沙11日电　据波兰通讯社9日报道：波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国工会代表在华沙举行的联合会议上通过了一项声明。声明说，在目前的情况下，争取维护和巩固和平的斗争是工会最重要的任务。
    声明认为，西德联邦议院关于用原子武器和火箭武器武装西德国防军的决定、在西德准备建造火箭发射场、希特勒军事团体的合法化、以及其他许多复活法西斯主义的措施是对欧洲和平的严重威胁。
    三国工会欢迎波、捷和民主德国三国外长今年4月的决定。三国工会要求采纳苏联关于北大西洋公约组织成员国立刻停止试验原子武器和无条件禁止使用各种原子武器的建议，要求在中欧建立无原子武器地区、实行普遍裁军、撤除在各国的军事基地和在欧洲建立有效的安全体系。
    三国工会呼吁西德工会联合会团结德国工人阶级和工会的一切力量共同为反对军国主义、为维护和平而斗争，并且表示准备立刻同西德的工会建立联系和友好合作。
    新华社11日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，西德卡尔斯卢厄10日有两万市民举行集会，抗议用原子武器装备西德军队。他们高举着的宣传画和标语上面写道：“反对原子武装！”“扔掉卡尔斯卢厄的火箭！”“卡尔斯卢厄决不能成为广岛！”
    德国基督教信义福音会会长马丁·尼穆勒、巴登—瓦登堡州经济部长（社会民主党人）法伊特、西德联邦议院社会民主党议员魏纳等人在群众大会上讲话时都号召为反对使西德实行原子武装的政策而斗争。
