Xinhua News Agency, 11th: To vigorously support the construction of local industries across the country and accelerate the development of China's industrialization, the design institutes under the First Ministry of Machine Building, after about a month of hard work, have rushed out a batch of typical designs for mechanical factories. These typical designs are on display at the Exhibition of Typical Designs for Small and Medium-Sized Mechanical Factories, which opened today.

The typical designs for various types of mechanical factories exhibited this time include general machinery factories, machine tool factories, power machinery factories, agricultural machinery and tractor factories, ball bearing factories, fertilizer equipment factories, foundries, electrical factories, light bulb factories, radio factories, as well as some non-mechanical chemical factories, artificial fiber factories, sawmills, and a total of 128 items.

The scale of these factories varies, mainly suitable for construction by special districts and counties; some are also suitable for construction by provinces and cities; in addition, there are some township agricultural implement repair stations, electrician repair stations, and so on.

In the process of designing this batch of factories, the various design institutes have specifically implemented the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The vast majority of factory investment is used for production equipment, and all other auxiliary facilities are simplified as much as possible, spending as little money as possible or not spending it at all. In terms of equipment selection, in addition to a small number of precision machine tools that must be used to ensure product quality, simple belt lathes or belt-motor dual-purpose machine tools are generally used. The factory building structure mostly adopts single-span brick and wood structure, and can be combined with adobe walls, bamboo walls, or straw sheds according to different local conditions. In this way, most of the equipment and building materials can be solved locally.

According to the design, the construction of these factories can generally be completed in one or two months to five months. The investment in special district and county-level factories generally only requires between one hundred thousand and one million yuan.

Considering that the characteristics of these small and medium-sized mechanical factories are mainly to serve agriculture, with a wide variety of products, and a construction process from small to large, the design also implements the principles of versatility, universality, and flexibility. Many factories can undertake both repair and manufacturing tasks. The layout of the factory area and workshops also takes into account the possibility of future development.

In order to meet the needs of local machinery industry construction, the exhibition also displays a batch of reusable drawings, product data, production equipment, and non-standard equipment drawings for selection by various regions.

### 一百多项中小机械厂典型设计出世

　　一百多项中小机械厂典型设计出世
    据新华社11日讯  为了大力支援全国各地建设地方工业，加速我国工业化事业的发展，第一机械工业部所属各设计院经过一个月左右的苦战，已经赶出一批机械工厂的典型设计。这些典型设计已在今天开幕的中小机械工厂典型设计展览会上展出。
    这次展出的各类机械工厂的典型设计有，通用机械厂、机床厂、动力机械厂、农业机械及拖拉机厂、滚珠轴承厂、化肥设备厂、铸工厂、电工厂、灯泡厂、收音机厂以及一部分非机械工业的化工厂、人造纤维厂、锯木厂等共一百二十八项。
    这些厂的规模，有大有小，主要是适合于专区和县建设用的；也有一些是适合于省市建设用的；此外还有一些乡的农具修配站、电工修配站等等。
    各个设计院在设计这批工厂的过程中，具体地贯彻了勤俭办企业的方针。工厂投资绝大部分都用于生产设备，其他一切辅助设施，都因陋就简，能少花钱的尽量少花或者不花。在选用设备方面，除了保证产品质量所必须采用的少数精密机床外，一般都采用结构简单的皮带车床或皮带马达两用机床。厂房建筑则大都采用单跨度的砖木结构，并且可以根据各地的不同条件，结合采用土坯墙、竹笆墙或席棚等办法。这样大部分的设备和建筑材料都可以就地解决。
    按照设计，这些工厂的建设一般只要一两个月到五个月就可以建成。专区和县级工厂的投资，一般只需要十几万到一百多万元。
    考虑到这些中小型机械工厂的特点主要是为农业服务，产品多种多样，建设步骤从小到大，所以在设计中还贯彻了通用性、万能性和灵活性的原则，许多工厂既能担负修理任务又能担负制造任务。在厂区和车间布置上，也考虑了将来发展的可能性。
    为了满足地方机械工业建设的需要，展览会还展出一批可供重复使用的图纸、产品资料、生产设备和非标准设备图纸，供各地选用。
