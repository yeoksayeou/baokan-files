Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 20th: Economic cooperation between Poland, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries is expanding daily.

Poland's trade with the Soviet Union ranks first in Poland's foreign trade, accounting for 30.3% of Poland's total foreign trade value. The Soviet Union supplies Poland with large quantities of industrial raw materials and machinery equipment. Three-quarters of the iron ore required by the Polish metallurgical industry is supplied by the Soviet Union. This year, the Soviet Union plans to continue supplying Poland with 4.4 million tons of iron ore. The machinery and equipment needed for the expansion of the Lenin Metallurgical Combine and the construction of the Warsaw High-Quality Steel Smelting Plant are also supplied by the Soviet Union. According to Polish newspapers, no Polish heavy industry sector has not received Soviet assistance. At the same time, Poland supplies the Soviet Union with coal, coking coal, metal products, sugar, and other products.

The economic cooperation agreement signed between the Soviet and Polish governments in Moscow in April determined the further expansion of economic cooperation between the two countries. The Soviet Union will supply the Turów Thermal Power Station with machinery and equipment with a generating capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts and will also supply the Vistula River hydroelectric power station with machinery and equipment with a generating capacity of 150,000 kilowatts. Poland will also further expand its exports to the Soviet Union.

Poland's commodity exchanges with neighboring East Germany and Czechoslovakia rank second and third respectively in Poland's foreign trade. Economic cooperation between these two countries and Poland is becoming increasingly close. East Germany provided loans to help Poland build the Turów Thermal Power Station. Czechoslovakia provided loans to help Poland develop its sulfur mining industry. The two countries also helped Poland increase brown coal production.

Poland's commodity exchange with Bulgaria this year will be greatly expanded compared to last year. Poland supplies Bulgaria with railway factory equipment, vehicles, and other machinery, while Poland receives ores, tobacco, fruits, furs, and other products from Bulgaria. The long-term trade agreement recently signed between Poland and Hungary stipulates that by 1960, trade between the two countries will greatly increase. Hungary will expand its supply of bauxite, aluminum, and daily industrial products to Poland, and Poland will increase its supply of lathes and coal mining machinery to Hungary. Poland's commodity exchange with Romania will increase by 15% this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague: After negotiations between government delegations from Czechoslovakia and Poland here, an agreement on expanding economic cooperation between the two countries was signed on the 17th by Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister Ďuranský and Polish Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Jaroszewicz on behalf of both parties.

The protocol specifically stipulates the further expansion of cooperation between the two countries from 1961 to 1965 in coal, machinery manufacturing, metallurgy, and the chemical industry, as well as in basic construction and production coordination.

Both parties agreed that within this year, the 1959-1960 trade agreement between the two countries would be further expanded. A supplementary protocol signed by both parties stipulates that the exchange of goods between the two countries will increase by 100 million foreign exchange rubles this year. Both parties also signed an agreement on the joint construction of a Polish brown coal mine. According to the agreement, Poland will receive a loan of 250 million rubles from Czechoslovakia.
