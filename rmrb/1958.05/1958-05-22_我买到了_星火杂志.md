    I Bought "Spark Magazine"
    On April 24th, I went to the Wangfujing International Bookstore to buy the fourteenth issue of the Soviet "Spark Magazine." However, this magazine was sold out because it contained four watercolor paintings by the Soviet artist Comrade Klimashin. Due to a sense of responsibility to her job and care for the readers, the bookstore saleswoman, Comrade Dong Yilan, searched tirelessly in the bookshelves and in the back warehouse for a long time but couldn't find it. Although I didn't buy the magazine, I felt very satisfied because of Comrade Dong's enthusiasm for the readers. However, just as I was about to step out of the bookstore door to express my gratitude, Comrade Dong caught up from behind and said, "Comrade, wait a moment! Please leave your office telephone number. We will contact other foreign magazine outlets in the city. If we have it, we will call you to notify you." The next day, I received a call from Comrade Dong to notify me to buy the magazine. When I walked happily out of the bookstore door with my beloved magazine in hand, I couldn't help but think that the spirit of hard work and dedication to the readers of comrades like Dong Yilan has given great comfort to many readers. I hope that other bookstore sales comrades can learn from Comrade Dong.

    我买到了“星火杂志”
    4月24日，我到王府井国际书店买第十四期苏联“星火杂志”，然而这本杂志由于里面刊载了四幅苏联画家克里马申同志的水彩画，已经全卖光了。由于工作的责任感和对读者的关怀，图书售货员董以兰同志不厌其烦地在书柜中、后面书库中寻找了很久并未找到。我虽然没有买到杂志，但由于董同志对读者的热情，我感到已经十分满足了。但是，当我表示谢意刚要踏出书店大门时，董同志从后面又赶上来说：“同志，等一等！请把您机关电话号码留下，我们再向本市其它出售外文杂志门市部联系一下，有的话我们再打电话通知您。”第二天我接到了董同志通知买杂志的电话。当我拿着心爱的杂志愉快地走出书店大门时，我不禁想到像董同志这样不辞辛苦、一切从读者出发的工作精神不知给予了多少读者以极大的欣慰。我希望其它图书售货员同志能更好地向董同志学习。
