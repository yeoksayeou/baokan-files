	The history of relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is written with friendship. The Soviet Union is the most sincere and reliable friend of the people of the United Arab Republic in their struggle for and defense of national independence. As early as 1924, the Soviet Union condemned the British ruling clique's suppression of the Egyptian people's struggle for national independence. In 1947, when the Egyptian government requested the Security Council to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, only the Soviet representative firmly supported this just demand. The Soviet Union resolutely supported Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company and opposed the imperialist conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to "internationalize" the canal. The Soviet Union's just stand and timely warning finally forced Britain, France, and Israel to stop their war of aggression against Egypt. Therefore, President Nasser once said very pertinently: "Since the Second World War, we have deeply felt the Soviet Union's help to us. Whenever someone in the United Nations attempts to infringe upon Egypt's freedom, the Soviet Union supports us."
	When Syria was seriously threatened by American subversion and preparations for a war of aggression in 1957, the Soviet government issued warnings to the United States and Turkey one after another, stating that it would impose sanctions on the aggressors. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Syrian people and the strong support of the Soviet Union, the US imperialist conspiracy of aggression was declared bankrupt.
	At the same time, the economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the UAR has also greatly developed. In March 1954, the Soviet Union and Egypt signed a trade agreement on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. This agreement stipulates that each party shall grant the other most-favored-nation treatment in trade and shipping. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union supplies Egypt with industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, automobiles, steel products, petroleum products, timber, grain, medicine and other commodities that are difficult to buy from imperialist countries. Egypt sells cotton, rice, leather products, etc., that need to be exported to the Soviet Union.
	In November 1957, the Soviet-Egyptian talks reached an agreement that the Soviet Union would provide Egypt with a preferential loan of 700 million rubles as economic assistance for Egypt's industrialization plan. This January, the two countries signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement. The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" said, "This agreement is great in both form and content. The agreement is based on mutual respect and complete equality. The Soviet Union is willing to meet Egypt's demands and has not imposed any political conditions on it in this regard." The Soviet Union also provides Egypt with the latest scientific and technological assistance. According to the Soviet-Egyptian agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy signed in July 1956, the Soviet Union is helping Egypt design and build an atomic physics laboratory and carry out other projects for the peaceful use of atomic energy.
	In 1955, the Soviet Union signed a trade and payment agreement with Syria. The Soviet Union supplies Syria with machinery, industrial equipment, automobiles, agricultural machinery, etc. that are needed for its economy, and purchases Syrian cotton, wool, leather, and other commodities traditionally exported by Syria. The Syrian "Al-Fajr" wrote in its commentary on the Soviet-Syrian trade agreement: This agreement is the first step in liberating Syria from foreign monopoly capital.
	In October 1957, the Soviet Union and Syria further signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will help Syria with design, surveying and research work, supply machinery, equipment and materials, and send experts to help with construction. At the same time, the Soviet Union will also provide Syria with the necessary loans at an annual interest rate of only 2.5% for a period of twelve years to pay for the above-mentioned expenses.
	The Soviet Union and Syria also signed a cultural cooperation agreement in August 1956. The agreement stipulates a wide exchange of experience and achievements in literature, art, science, higher education, education, sports and other aspects between the two countries.
	The development of friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is conducive to the smooth progress of the United Arab Republic along the path of independence and self-reliance, and is also in the interests of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. President Nasser's visit to the Soviet Union this time will further consolidate the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United Arab Republic, making it everlasting.

　　苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊
    苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国两国关系史是用友谊编写的。苏联是阿拉伯联合共和国人民在争取和保卫民族独立斗争中最真诚可靠的朋友。早在1924年，苏联就曾谴责英国统治集团对埃及人民争取民族独立斗争的镇压行为。1947年，当埃及政府向安理会提出英军撤出埃及的要求时，唯有苏联代表坚决地支持这一正义要求。苏联坚决支持埃及收回苏伊士运河公司，反对美英法帝国主义“国际管制”运河的阴谋计划。苏联的正义立场和及时警告，终于迫使英、法和以色列停止侵埃战争。所以，纳赛尔总统曾十分中肯地说：“第二次世界大战以后，我们深深地感到苏联对我们的帮助，每当联合国内有人企图侵犯埃及的自由时，苏联就支持我们”。
   1957年叙利亚受到美国颠覆和准备发动侵略战争的严重威胁时，苏联政府先后向美国和土耳其发出警告，表示将对侵略者予以制裁。由于叙利亚人民的英勇斗争和苏联的有力支持，美帝国主义的侵略阴谋宣告破产。
    与此同时，苏、阿两国的经济文化合作关系，也有了很大的发展。1954年3月，苏埃签订了平等互利的贸易协定。这个协定规定，给予对方在贸易上和航运上最惠国待遇。根据这个协定，苏联供给埃及在帝国主义国家那里很难买到的工业设备、农业机器、汽车、钢铁制品、石油产品、木材、粮食、医药和其它商品。埃及则把需要出口的棉花、大米、皮革制品等售给苏联。
    1957年11月，苏埃会谈达成协议，苏联提供埃及七亿卢布优惠贷款，作为对埃及工业化计划的经济援助。今年1月，两国签订了经济技术合作协定。埃及“金字塔报”说，“这项协定无论在形式或是在内容上都是伟大的。协定是以互相完全尊敬和完全平等为基础的。苏联愿意答应埃及的要求，并且在这方面没有对它强加任何政治条件”。苏联还给埃及以最新的科学技术援助。根据1956年7月签订的苏埃和平利用原子能合作协定，苏联帮助埃及设计和建设原子物理实验所和进行其它和平利用原子能的工程。
    1955年，苏联同叙利亚签订了贸易和支付协定。苏联供给叙利亚经济上所需要的机器、工业设备、汽车、农业机器等，并购买叙利亚的棉花、羊毛、皮革和叙利亚传统出口的其它商品。叙利亚“先锋报”在评论苏叙贸易协定时写道：这个协定是使叙利亚从外国垄断资本解放出来的第一步。
    1957年10月，苏联和叙利亚进一步签订了经济和技术合作协定。根据这项协定，苏联要帮助叙利亚进行设计、勘察和调查研究工作，供应机器、装备和材料，派遣专家帮助建设。同时苏联还给叙利亚年息仅2.5％、为期十二年的必要贷款，以便偿付上述有关的费用。
    苏联和叙利亚还在1956年8月签订了文化合作协定。协定规定广泛地交换两国在文学、艺术、科学、高等教育、教育、体育运动和其他方面所获得的经验和成就。
    苏联同阿拉伯联合共和国的友好合作关系的发展，有助于阿拉伯联合共和国顺利地沿着独立自主的道路前进，同时也符合于苏联和全世界爱好和平人民的利益。这次纳赛尔总统访问苏联，将使苏联人民和阿拉伯联合共和国人民的友谊更加巩固，万古长青。　（映）
