　　Ox and Horse Driven Generator
    Animal-powered generators have recently been successfully trial-produced in Chifeng, Tongliao, Ulanhot, and Ongniud Banner in Inner Mongolia.

    This type of generator is characterized by its simple structure, low cost, ease of mastery and repair, and is very suitable for agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. The dual-purpose animal-powered generator manufactured by the workers of the Ongniud Banner Iron Factory only requires one horse, one ox, or two donkeys to pull, and each unit costs only the equivalent of two horses.

    Animal husbandry is quite developed in Inner Mongolia, and each agricultural and pastoral cooperative has many draught animals. The emergence of animal-powered generators will promote the early realization of rural and grassland electrification plans.

    Xinhua News Agency reports: The ox-drawn generator trial-produced by the Kunming Municipal Handicraft Industry Cooperative Electrical Repair Factory, only requires one ox pulling a lever to rotate, and can generate 1,500 watts of alternating current or 1,100 watts of direct current for rural lighting, broadcasting, radio listening, water pumping, and other uses. This type of ox-drawn generator has the characteristics of being small, lightweight, not easily damaged, simple to maintain, and easy to manage.

　　牛马拉的发电机
    畜力发电机最近在内蒙古赤峰、通辽、乌兰浩特、翁牛特旗等地相继试制成功。
    这种发电机具有结构简单、成本低廉、容易掌握和修理的特点，很适合于农牧业社用。翁牛特旗铁工厂职工制造的两用畜力发电机，只要一匹马或一头牛或两头驴就能拉动，每台造价只合两匹马的钱。
    内蒙古的畜牧业相当发达，每个农牧业社都有不少役畜。畜力发电机的出现，将促进农村和草原电气化计划早日实现。
    昆明市手工业联社电器修造厂试制成的牛拉发电机，只要一头牛拉着杠杆转动，就能发出一千五百瓦的交流电或一千一百瓦的直流电，供农村照明、广播、收听收音机、抽水等用。这种牛拉发电机有体小轻便、不易损坏、维护简单、管理方便等特点。　（据新华社讯）
