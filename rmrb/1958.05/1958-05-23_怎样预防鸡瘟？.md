    How to Prevent Fowl Plague?
    Recently, we have received letters from some readers requesting information on how to prevent fowl plague. Now, let's discuss how to prevent fowl plague.
    The term "fowl plague" as used in rural areas has a broad scope, encompassing all acute epidemic diseases such as Newcastle disease, fowl cholera, and fowl typhoid, which cause a large number of deaths. In fact, fowl plague refers specifically to Newcastle disease, which is currently the most harmful disease to chickens.
    Newcastle disease (named after the place "Newcastle" in England where the disease was first discovered), also known as Asian fowl plague, is a disease transmitted by a filterable virus. This disease spreads quickly and has a high mortality rate; approximately ninety out of a hundred infected chickens will die. Affected chickens initially lose their appetite, become lethargic, and want to sleep. Their combs and wattles change from bright red to dark red and reddish-black, and gray scales appear on their skin. Their eyes are tightly closed, and red mucus flows from their mouths and noses. They often shake their heads, make strange noises, and may have diarrhea with yellow-green feces. Finally, their heads bend backward, they experience difficulty breathing, become paralyzed, and die.
    Currently, there is no good treatment for this chicken disease, but it can be prevented. The prevention method is to use Newcastle disease vaccines to inoculate the chickens, so they do not get the disease. All areas that have previously experienced fowl plague and areas with convenient transportation for export tasks should do vaccine preventive inoculation work as early as possible. According to the inoculation situations in many regions, the effect is very good. Fuxi District of Fushun City and Shahe Township of Changping District in Beijing, fowl plague was very popular before 1956, but after two years of prevention work, fowl plague has not occurred again. Giving chickens vaccine inoculation is similar to people being vaccinated against smallpox in principle, and the method is simple and easy to learn. After the chicks hatch, you can drop one drop of Newcastle disease II strain attenuated vaccine into the chick's nostrils, or it is more convenient to concentrate many chicks in the house and spray them with a disinfectant sprayer. Then, when the chicks grow to four or five months old, use a pen nib or a large needle to dip a drop of diluted vaccine and prick it two or three times under the skin on the inside of the chicken's wing (it is best to wipe this area with cotton dipped in alcohol or shochu first). After two vaccinations, the chicken will be immune for life and will no longer get fowl plague. As for vaccines, the animal husbandry and veterinary departments of each province and city are responsible for supplying them. If agricultural cooperatives in various places want to vaccinate, they can contact the local animal husbandry and veterinary stations directly.
    In addition to vaccination, prevention of fowl plague should also include cleaning and disinfecting chicken coops and chicken farms and properly disposing of the carcasses of diseased chickens. 1. Usually pay attention to observing the chicken flocks: If you find a sick chicken, you should immediately isolate the sick chicken from the healthy chickens and prevent them from running around; 2. Chicken coops and courtyards should be cleaned regularly and disinfected regularly (using 2% Lysol, 5% lye water, or 20% hot wood ash water); 3. Dead chickens should be buried deeply or burned and cannot be thrown away, let alone eaten, to avoid spreading the infection.

### 怎样预防鸡瘟？

    怎样预防鸡瘟？
    最近我们接到一些读者来信，要求介绍一些预防鸡瘟的方法。现在我们就来谈谈怎样预防鸡瘟的问题。
    农村中所说的鸡瘟，包括范围很广，凡是发生鸡新城疫、鸡霍乱、鸡伤寒等急性流行病，并造成大量死亡的都说是鸡瘟。其实鸡瘟仅仅是指鸡新城疫，当前对鸡危害最大的也就是这种鸡病。
    鸡新城疫（因此病最初发现在英国一个叫“新城”的地方，故得这个名称）又叫亚洲鸡瘟，是由一种过滤性病毒传染的疾病。这种病传得快、死亡率高，一百只鸡得了病，差不多要死九十多只。得病的鸡，起初不想吃东西，没精神，想睡，冠及垂肉由鲜红色变为暗红色、红黑色，皮肤上发生灰色鳞片，眼紧闭，口鼻有红色粘液流出，常摇头，发出怪声，间有腹泻，粪为黄绿色，最后头向后弯，呼吸困难，麻痹而死亡。
    目前对于这种鸡病还没有很好的治疗方法，但是可以预防。预防办法，就是用鸡新城疫疫苗接种，使鸡不得这种病。凡是以往发生过鸡瘟的地区和交通方便有出口任务的地区，都应及早的做好疫苗的预防接种工作。根据许多地区接种的情况来看，效果很好。抚顺市扶西区和北京市昌平区沙河乡，在1956年以前鸡瘟很流行，但经过两年的预防工作，再没有发生过鸡瘟。给鸡进行疫苗接种，和人种牛痘的道理差不多，方法简便，容易学会。在小鸡孵出后，可以用鸡新城疫Ⅱ系弱毒疫苗滴一滴到小鸡鼻子里，或者将许多小鸡集中在屋内，用消毒喷雾器喷撒更是方便。然后等小鸡生长到四、五个月时，再用钢笔尖或大头针蘸一滴冲淡了的疫苗，在鸡翅膀内侧皮下（此处最好先用棉花蘸酒精或烧酒擦一擦）扎两三下就成了。经过两次接种以后，这只鸡就可终身免疫，不再得鸡瘟了。至于疫苗，各省市的畜牧兽医部门都负责供应。各地农业社如要接种疫苗，可直接跟当地畜牧兽医站联系。
    预防鸡瘟，除了接种疫苗以外，还应做好鸡舍、养鸡场的清洁卫生和病鸡的尸体处理工作。一、平常注意观察鸡群：如发现病鸡，应立即将病鸡与好鸡隔离，不让乱跑；二、鸡窝和庭院应经常打扫干净，并作到定期消毒（用2％的来苏儿，5％的石碱水或20％的热草木灰水均可）；三、死鸡应深埋或烧掉，不能乱扔，更不能吃，以免扩大传染。　　编者
