Farmers Can Also Do Scientific Research
		Jin Wen
Science comes from practice, from the accumulation of people's labor experience, and is extremely ordinary. Later, science was mystified, which was deliberately created by the exploiting classes, especially the bourgeoisie. Their purpose was to "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." They deprived the laboring people of the right to education, separated mental labor from physical labor, and boasted about science as being unattainable, so that the laboring people would forever be exploited and forever be ruled. Thus, people were made superstitious. People thought that science was only a matter for scholars and experts, and that people who had not received formal higher education, especially the laboring people, could not even inquire about it.

The liberated people must be freed from this mystical concept intentionally created by the exploiting classes. The farmers of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, used practical actions to expose this mystical concept. They established experimental fields and scientific research laboratories, and engaged in scientific research on a large scale.

The behavior of the farmers of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative is very ordinary, but it is also very extraordinary. The farmers of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative summed up and improved their production practice experience, which is scientific research, and this is of course an ordinary thing. However, such an ordinary thing, farmers of other agricultural cooperatives do not even dare to think about, but the farmers of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative dare to think and dare to do, which is very extraordinary. We should praise them and support them!

The broad masses of peasants are building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Their leap forward targets are constantly being increased, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has inspired the people of the whole country. But to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, in addition to having full revolutionary drive, we must also innovate and innovate in agricultural production technology, and we must carry out a technical revolution. The technical revolution is a mass undertaking, which must rely on scientific and technical personnel, and even more on the broad masses of working people. Farmers engaging in scientific research is an important aspect of the technical revolution. Among the broad masses of peasants, people are spontaneously and relatively simply engaged in scientific research, and various inventions and creations are constantly emerging. Establishing scientific research organizations like the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative, mobilizing more research forces, and conducting research in a planned way will result in more, faster, better, and more economical research, and will lead to newer research results.

The scientific research laboratory of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative is the first scientific research organization of an agricultural cooperative in our country! It can be imagined that the second, the third, and even thousands of agricultural cooperative scientific research organizations will be born one after another. The establishment of such scientific research organizations means that the people will develop into laborers who use both their hands and brains and are capable of both literary and military skills, and it means that we are moving towards the great communist ideal.

    农民也能研究科学
    金文
    科学来自实践，来自人们劳动经验的积累，是极平凡的。后来科学被神秘化了，那是剥削阶级、特别是资产阶级故意造成的。他们的目的在于使“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”。他们剥夺了劳动人民受教育的权利，又把脑力劳动和体力劳动分割开来，把科学吹嘘得高不可攀，使劳动人民永远受剥削、永远被统治。于是人们被弄得迷信起来。人们以为科学只能是学者、专家的事，没有受过正规的高等教育的人，尤其劳动人民，是不能闻问的。
    解放了的人民，必须从剥削阶级有意制造的这种神秘观念中解放出来。陕西醴泉县烽火农业社的农民，用实际行动揭穿了这种神秘观念。他们建立试验田、建立科学研究室，大搞起科学来。
    烽火农业社农民们的行为，是很平凡的，但又是很不平凡的。烽火农业社的农民们总结、提高自己的生产实践经验，这就是科学研究，这当然是平凡的事。可是，这样平凡的事，别的农业社的农民们甚至还不敢想，烽火农业社的农民们敢想敢作，这就很不平凡。我们应该歌颂他们、支持他们！
    广大农民群众正多快好省地建设社会主义。他们的跃进指标一加再加，他们的革命干劲已经使全国人民受到了鼓舞。但是要达到多快好省，除了鼓足革命干劲，还必须在农业生产技术上革新再革新，必须进行技术革命。技术革命是一件群众性的大事，要依靠科学技术人员，更要依靠广大的劳动群众。农民进行科学研究是技术革命的重要方面。在广大农民群众中，人们在自发地、比较简单地进行着科学研究，各种各样的创造发明不断地涌现。像烽火农业社那样正式建立科学研究组织，动员更多的研究力量，有计划地进行研究，会研究得更多、更快、更好、更省，并得到更新的研究成果。
    烽火农业社科学研究室是我国第一个农业社的科学研究组织！可以设想，第二个、第三个以至成千成万个农业社科学研究组织将相继诞生。这样的科学研究组织的建立，意味着人民将发展成为手脑并用、能文能武的劳动者，意味着我们正向着伟大的共产主义理想前进。
