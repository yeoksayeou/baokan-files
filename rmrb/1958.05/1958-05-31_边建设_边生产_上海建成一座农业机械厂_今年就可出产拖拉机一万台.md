Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th: An agricultural machinery factory in Shanghai, with an annual production capacity of 20,000 tractors, is starting production while still under construction. It is expected to produce 10,000 universal tractors of four, seven, eight, and twenty-seven horsepower this year.

On March 1st of this year, the four-horsepower universal tractor was only initially trial-produced successfully in Shanghai. According to conventional practices, a considerable amount of time is needed from the initial successful trial production of a product to its finalization, and then one would start considering building a factory and arranging production. This step-by-step approach would not only make it impossible for the new factory under construction to be put into production this year, but even expanding an old factory using existing equipment, manpower, and technical conditions would not lead to mass production this year.

The Shanghai Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries adopted revolutionary measures: on the one hand, it conducted assessments of the successfully trial-produced small universal tractors through actual use by farmers and concentrated technical forces to make urgent modifications; at the same time, it decided to immediately merge three small factories with about 100 people each with the students and equipment from the First Technical School supported by the Labor Bureau and relocate and expand the factory. To speed up the pace, it also utilized the buildings vacated by the Commercial Cadre School to carry out factory building renovation projects. In just over a month, the four units completed the relocation work, which was half a year ahead of building new factory buildings. The total investment for the expansion was less than two million yuan.

### 边建设　边生产  上海建成一座农业机械厂  今年就可出产拖拉机一万台

    边建设　边生产
    上海建成一座农业机械厂
    今年就可出产拖拉机一万台
    据新华社上海30日电　一座年产两万台拖拉机的上海农业机械厂正在一边建设、一边开始生产；预计今年能生产四、七、八和二十七马力的万能拖拉机一万台。
    今年3月1日，四马力的万能拖拉机才在上海初步试制成功。按照常规，产品初步试制成功到最后定型，还需相当长的时间，然后着手考虑建厂问题，安排生产。这种按部就班的做法，不仅筹建的新厂今年不可能投入生产，就是利用老厂的设备、人力、技术条件进行扩建，今年也不可能大量生产。
    上海机电工业局采取了革命措施，一面将试制成功的小型万能拖拉机，通过农民实际使用进行鉴定，集中技术力量，突击修改；同时决定将三家百人左右的小厂，同劳动局支援的第一技工学校的学员和设备，立即合并，迁厂扩建。为了加快步伐，又利用商业干部学校让出的房屋，进行厂房的改建工程。在短短一个多月时间内，四个单位便完成了迁厂工作，这比新建厂房要提前半年时间。扩建的全部投资不到二百万元。
