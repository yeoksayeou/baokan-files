Xinhua News Agency, May 30th dispatch from Paris: News: In the past two days, many French cities have continuously held anti-fascist strikes, teaching boycotts, and demonstrations.

The National Education Federation and the National Teachers' Union, affiliated with the Catholic Labor Confederation, held a teaching boycott today involving 240,000 primary and secondary school teachers. On the same day, miners in the coal regions of Nord and Pas-de-Calais provinces also went on strike, with the vast majority of miners in the coal regions participating.

On the 29th, a demonstration of 30,000 people was held in Lyon. The procession marched from the employment agency to the Republic Monument in the central square, singing the Marseillaise and the Internationale along the way. In Denain, Nord province, a demonstration of 10,000 people took place. In Tarbes, southwestern France, workers held a protest march against De Gaulle, shouting slogans such as "De Gaulle will never succeed" and "Down with Soustelle." On the same day, anti-fascist demonstrations and rallies were also held in Lorient, Nice, and La Rochelle. In some places, workers held short strikes while holding demonstrations.

On the 29th, the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) passed a resolution criticizing President Coty for asking De Gaulle to form a cabinet, considering this to be "a challenge to the emotions and will of the people of the Republic," and demanding that the parliament refuse to authorize De Gaulle to form a cabinet. The CGT called on the working people to hold strikes, work stoppages, and demonstrations and to be ready at any time to give a heavy blow to the rioters who attempt to threaten the Republic.

At the same time, many groups issued statements on the evening of the 29th, expressing their determination to defend the Republic. The National Federation of Former Resistance Fighters issued a communique calling on former resistance fighters to actively participate in the committees for the defense of the Republic. The Auschwitz and Buchenwald Concentration Camp Deportees Friendship Association, the Movement Against Racism, Anti-Semitism, and for Peace, and the National Union of French Students all issued similar statements.

According to Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The working people of the German Democratic Republic are vigorously supporting the struggle of the French people against fascist forces.

A mass rally of several thousand working people was held in Berlin on the 29th to support the French people's struggle against fascism. Workers and staff from various enterprises and institutions in Berlin participated in the rally. Otto Grotewohl, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Bach, Chairman of the Chamber of the States, Correns, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic German, and representatives of various democratic parties and mass organizations attended the rally.

One hundred and eighty thousand intellectuals from the German Democratic Republic, including scientists, artists, technicians, and doctors, sent a telegram to French anti-fascist intellectuals, saying: "We believe that the French people, loyal to the republican, democratic, and revolutionary traditions, will certainly fight back against this attack on peace and democracy, and will unite to act in unison."

Lecturers in the economics department of Humboldt University in Berlin said in a telegram to the president and all staff of the University of Paris: "Germans know the darkness of fascism well. Use all your strength to prevent fascism from gaining power in France!" The telegram said, "We support you! Fascists must not succeed!"

Workers at the Rethewisch Cement Factory in Neubrandenburg State held a meeting on the 29th, and they wrote a letter to the French General Confederation of Labor, expressing their solidarity with the French workers.

Female workers at a factory in Dresden wrote a letter to Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, supporting the heroic French women, French mothers, and all loyal patriots who are fighting to defend the Republic.

According to Xinhua News Agency, London, May 30th: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, demanded at a mass rally held here on the 29th that the British labor movement take action to support the struggle of the French people against the rebellious actions of De Gaulle and other generals who endanger democracy and the republican system.

The resolution unanimously passed by the rally, organized by the London Communist Party District Committee, said: "We welcome the growing unity shown by the French working class and all republican forces, and we believe that the united front of communists, socialists, radicals, and other democrats will have the will and power to thoroughly defeat any attempt to impose a dictatorship."

In his speech, Pollitt pointed out that the conspiracy of the French fascists to usurp power is not only a serious threat to democracy but also a serious threat to peace because the generals in Algiers hope to wage a full-scale war in Algeria and invade Tunisia.

Pollitt also pointed out that the British Conservative newspapers are praising the rebellious actions of De Gaulle and other generals. These newspapers used to support Hitler and the German fascists, and people remember the enormous price the world paid for that. (Attached picture)

    据新华社伦敦30日电　英国共产党总书记高兰29日在这里举行的群众集会上要求英国劳工运动采取行动，声援法国人民反对戴高乐和其他将军们危害民主和共和制度的叛乱行为的斗争。
    这次由伦敦共产党区委员会组织的集会一致通过的决议说：“我们对法国工人阶级和所有共和力量日益显示出来的团结一致表示欢迎，我们相信，共产党人、社会党人、激进党人和其他民主人士的联合阵线将具有彻底打垮硬要实行独裁制度的一切企图的意志和力量。”
    高兰在演说时指出，法国法西斯分子篡夺政权的阴谋不但是对民主的严重威胁，而且也是对和平的严重威胁。因为在阿尔及尔的将军们希望在阿尔及利亚进行全面战争，并且侵犯突尼斯。
