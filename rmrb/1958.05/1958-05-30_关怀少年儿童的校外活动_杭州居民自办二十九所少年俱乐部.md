Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 29th. Residents of Hangzhou have recently established twenty-nine "Children's Clubs" without spending a penny of state funds, initially satisfying the desire of children for enriching after-school lives. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this is an effective way to carry out extracurricular education for children, and plans to establish children's clubs in all of the city's four hundred residential areas after Children's Day on June 1st. It also plans to establish a city-wide "Children's Palace" and a "Children's Home" in each of the six urban districts by the end of the year. In this way, together with the original extracurricular education institutions, the city will form a mass extracurricular education network for children.

Hangzhou currently has approximately 200,000 children under the age of fifteen, of which approximately 150,000 are of school age, accounting for about one-seventh of the city's population. In recent years, the Party and the state have opened city-wide public activity places for the city's children, such as children's science and technology stations, children's parks, children's reading rooms, and amateur sports schools for children. However, the number of these activity places is small and far from meeting the needs of children's extracurricular activities, especially after the implementation of the two-shift system. Many children lack extracurricular activity venues and rich after-school lives, causing them to wander the streets, gamble with picture cards, play poker, and make noise. More seriously, a small number of children are lured and exploited by hooligans and bad elements to engage in theft and other activities, which disturb social order. This issue has aroused widespread attention from all sectors of society. During the rectification movement, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, in accordance with the demands of the masses, decided that in addition to improving the work of existing extracurricular education institutions, they would further carry out mass extracurricular activities for children throughout the city. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched discussions on the establishment of "Children's Clubs" among residents of various districts, which received a wide and enthusiastic response and support. The Baishifang residential area of ​​Hefang Street in Shangcheng District established the city's first "Children's Club" during the street rectification, and through observation, learning, and holding on-site meetings, other districts also established "Children's Clubs" one after another.

The "Children's Clubs" in various residential areas of Hangzhou are built in accordance with the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. The masses raise funds for houses, equipment, utensils, and expenses themselves. The size and equipment of the clubs vary. The larger ones have two or three rooms and an activity park; the smaller ones have only one room. Each residential area has a committee member responsible for leading the club, and the day-to-day activity management of many clubs is handled by the Young Pioneer organizations of nearby elementary schools. The clubs are open every afternoon and evening, and children can participate in activities with an "activity card." Activities include reading, chess games, rope skipping, and ball sports. Some clubs invite combat heroes and advanced producers to join them for evening gatherings every week, or have the Young Pioneer team from a nearby school show slides.

The establishment of "Children's Clubs" has significantly reduced the phenomena of children loitering in the streets, engaging in gang fights, and cursing, and has won the support of the majority of residents. Many female workers said: "In the past, my body was in the workshop, but my heart was with my children. Now that the children have clubs, we can work in the workshop with peace of mind."

    关怀少年儿童的校外活动
    杭州居民自办二十九所少年俱乐部
    新华社杭州29日电　杭州市居民最近没有花国家一个钱，自己办起了二十九所“少年俱乐部”，初步满足了少年儿童丰富课余生活的愿望。中共杭州市委认为这是开展校外儿童教育工作的有效办法，计划在“六一”儿童节后，在全市四百多个居民区都建立起少年俱乐部；并计划到年底以前建立一个全市性的“少年宫”，六个市区各建立一个“少年之家”。这样，连同原来的校外教育机关，全市将组成一个群众性的少年儿童校外教育网。
    杭州市现有十五岁以下的少年儿童约二十万人，其中学龄儿童约十五万人，占全市人口七分之一左右。几年来，党和国家为全市少年儿童开辟了少年科技站、儿童公园、儿童图书阅览室、少年业余体育学校等全市性的公共活动场所。但是这些活动场所数量少，还远远满足不了儿童校外活动的需要，尤其在实行二部制后，许多孩子由于缺乏校外活动场地和丰富的课余生活而逛大街、赌洋片、打扑克、乱吵乱闹。更严重的是，有少数少年儿童受到流氓分子和坏分子的引诱和利用，进行偷窃等活动，妨害社会秩序。这一问题引起了社会各界人士的普遍重视。在整风运动中，中共杭州市委和共青团市委根据群众的要求，决定除了改进现有校外教育机构的工作外，进一步开展全市群众性的少年儿童校外活动工作。中共杭州市委曾把建立“少年俱乐部”的问题发动各区居民讨论，得到了广泛热烈的响应和支持。上城区河坊街百岁坊居民区在街道整风中建立了全市第一个“少年俱乐部”，通过观摩学习和召开现场会议，其他各区也纷纷建立起“少年俱乐部”。
    杭州市各居民区的“少年俱乐部”是根据多快好省，勤俭办一切事业的精神兴建的，群众自筹房屋、设备、用具和经费，俱乐部的规模大小、设备多少不一。大的有两三间房子，一个活动园地；小的只有一间房子。各居民区都有一个委员负责领导俱乐部，许多俱乐部的日常活动管理都是由附近小学的少先队组织负责。俱乐部每天上下午都开放，儿童凭“活动卡”就可以参加活动。活动内容有图书阅览、赛棋、跳绳和球类运动等。有的俱乐部每周有一个晚上邀请战斗英雄和先进生产者来联欢，或者由附近学校少先队来放映幻灯片。
    “少年俱乐部”的成立，使少年儿童中逛街、打群架、骂人等现象显著减少，得到了广大居民的拥护。不少女工说：过去人在车间、心在孩子，现在孩子有了俱乐部，我们在车间里生产也安心了。
