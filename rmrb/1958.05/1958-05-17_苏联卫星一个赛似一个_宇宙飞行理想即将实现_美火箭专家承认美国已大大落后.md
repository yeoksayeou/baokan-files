　　Soviet Satellites Are Better Than the Last: Space Flight Ideals Are About to Be Realized
    American Rocket Experts Admit the US is Far Behind
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - Soviet academician Sedov, a famous cosmonautics expert, wrote in "Pravda" today that the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite has a large capacity and payload, and its interior is fully capable of freely accommodating a person and all the food and equipment he needs.
    He said that the satellites launched by the Soviet Union are more and more perfect in design, and each satellite has brought new qualitative progress. It is entirely realistic to realize the ideal of flying to Mars and revealing the fascinating secrets of this planet in the next two decades. The transition from artificial earth satellites to rockets capable of interplanetary flight is not far away.
    Today, Moscow newspapers published interviews with scientists, praising the characteristics and great progress of the new satellite.
    Academician Blagonravov emphasized that this is the first satellite that can include the entire high-altitude exploration program of the International Geophysical Year. He said that the new satellite convincingly proves the new great victory of Soviet science. The volume of the third satellite is so large and contains so many instruments that it can be called a space combine or an automated sky laboratory.
    Corresponding academician Fedorov published an article in "Soviet Russia" saying that the new satellite is one and a half times heavier than the second satellite. This very astonishing fact proves the rapid progress of Soviet rocket construction technology. Anyone knows that every extra kilogram of high-altitude rockets plays a big role, it requires greatly increasing the power of the rocket engine, and the weight of our rocket has increased by several hundred kilograms at once.
    The new satellite is huge in weight, so it can be filled with various instruments, and the number of instruments determines the scientific value of the space laboratory.
    Fedorov detailed the instruments on the satellite. He said that there are two categories of instruments, one is the basic measuring device for observing natural phenomena, and the other can supply power to the instrument, manipulate the instrument, and turn the materials measured by the instrument into telegraph signals to send back to the ground.
    Fedorov emphasized that the third satellite will measure the earth's magnetic field strength for the first time. Scientists can obtain direct materials about the atmospheric composition and pressure in the very high altitude for the first time, so that they can explore the edge of the uppermost layer of the atmosphere.
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th - TASS Moscow: Sternfeld, a famous Soviet expert in interstellar transportation and winner of the International Astronautical Encouragement Award, said when commenting on the third Soviet satellite that calculations show that if the third satellite is replaced by a single-stage rocket of the same weight equipped with all necessary scientific instruments, the speed can be increased by another 3.5 kilometers per second, so that the rocket can reach the moon, Mars or Venus.
    In this interview with a TASS reporter, Sternfeld also pointed out that the third Soviet satellite can already be used as a manned spacecraft, and in terms of its size, it is already close to a link in an inhabitable extraterrestrial scientific station.
    The simplest calculations can show that such a huge satellite cannot be launched even with two multi-stage rockets like the one that launched the second Soviet satellite. Obviously, the new rocket is much more perfect than the past, and the thrust is incomparably greater.
    He said that everyone knows that it is impossible to study and conquer the universe with small, unmanned satellites. The weight comparison of the first three Soviet satellites is a clear indicator of the speed of Soviet progress in rocket technology. This speed of progress makes people full of confidence in realizing the long-standing ideal of human space flight. Now all that remains is to solve the problem of the satellite returning to the ground.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 16th - TASS Moscow: Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, who is visiting the Soviet Union, told reporters from the "Moscow Evening News" on the 15th that the launch of the third artificial earth satellite by the Soviet Union is a huge success and a brilliant victory. He said that the new outstanding achievements of Soviet science will surely make the whole world and the entire civilized human race happy.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The launch of the third artificial satellite by the Soviet Union has caused a strong reaction in the scientific community in Western countries. When commenting on the weight of the Soviet satellite and the power of the rocket launching the satellite, many American experts had to admit that the Soviet Union has undeniable advantages in rocket technology.
    Braun, a famous American rocket expert and designer of the "Explorer" satellite, said that the launch of the third Soviet satellite proves that "the Russians are indeed ahead of us in this race." He believes that sending the third artificial satellite into space may be a powerful intercontinental ballistic rocket with a thrust of at least 135,000 kg to 225,000 kg. Medaris, head of the US Army Missile, also admitted that the third satellite launched by the Soviet Union confirmed that they have mastered the technology to launch rockets to the moon.
    Many British scientists praised Soviet rocket technology. Gartland, chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, said that the weight of the new Soviet satellite shows that the Soviets already possess a rocket that is more powerful than an intercontinental missile.

　　苏联卫星一个赛似一个  宇宙飞行理想即将实现
    美火箭专家承认美国已大大落后
    新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联著名宇宙飞行专家塞道夫院士今天在“真理报”上著文说，苏联第三个人造卫星容量和载重量很大，内部完全足以自由地容纳一个人和他所需要的食物及全部装备。
    他说，苏联发射的卫星，一个比一个的设计更加完善，每一个卫星都带来了新的质的进步。在今后二十年中实现飞到火星的理想，揭示这个行星引人入胜的秘密，是完全现实的。人造地球卫星过渡到可以从事行星之间飞行的火箭，为期已经不远了。
    今天莫斯科各报都登载了科学家的谈话，赞扬新卫星的特点和巨大进步。
    布拉冈拉沃夫院士着重指出，这是第一个能把国际地球物理年全部高空考察计划包括进来的卫星。他说，新卫星令人信服地证明了苏联科学的新的伟大胜利。第三个卫星的体积是这样大，容纳的仪器这样多，以致完全可以称之为宇宙联合机或自动化的天空试验室。
    费多罗夫通讯院士在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上发表文章说，新卫星比第二个卫星重一倍半。这个非常惊人的事实证明了苏联火箭建造技术进步的迅速。任何人都知道，高空火箭每多一公斤所起的作用都很大，它要求大大增加火箭发动机的威力，而我们火箭的重量一下就增加了好几百公斤。
    新卫星重量巨大，因而可以放进各式仪器，仪器的多少是决定宇宙实验室的科学价值的。
    费多罗夫详细介绍了卫星上的仪器。他说，这些仪器一共有两类，一类是对自然现象进行观测的基本测量装置，一类可以给仪器供电，操纵仪器、把仪器测量的材料变成电报讯号发回地面。
    费多罗夫强调指出，第三个卫星将第一次对地球磁场强度进行测量。科学家可以第一次获得有关很高的高空中大气组成及压力的直接材料，从而能够探查到大气层最上层的边缘。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名星际交通专家、国际宇宙飞行鼓励奖获得者斯特恩菲尔德在评论苏联第三个卫星时说，计算表明，如果把第三个卫星换成一个装有一切必要科学仪器的同样重量的单级火箭，就能够使每秒速度再增加三·五公里，这样，这个火箭就能够到达月球、火星或金星了。
    斯特恩菲尔德在对塔斯社记者发表的这次谈话中还指出，第三个苏联卫星已经可以用作载人的宇宙飞船，就其大小来说，已经接近于可以住人的大气层外科学站的一个环节了。
    最简单的计算都可以表明，这样巨大的卫星，如果用发射苏联第二个卫星的那种多级火箭来发射，即使用上两个也发射不上去。显然，新火箭比过去的完善得多，推力大得无法比拟。
    他说，大家知道，利用不大的不载人的卫星，是不可能研究和征服宇宙的。苏联头三个卫星的重量对比，是苏联在火箭技术方面进展速度的明显指标。这种进展速度使人们对实现长久以来的理想——人类在宇宙空间飞行，充满了信心。现在剩下的只是解决卫星回到地面上来的问题了。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：正在苏联访问的世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里15日对“莫斯科晚报”记者说，苏联发射第三个人造地球卫星是一个巨大的成功和辉煌的胜利。他说，苏联科学新的卓越成就一定会使全世界、使整个文明的人类感到高兴。
    据新华社16日讯　苏联发射第三个人造卫星，在西方国家科学界中引起强烈的反应。美国许多专家在评论苏联卫星的重量以及发射卫星的火箭的威力时，不得不承认苏联在火箭技术方面有着无法否认的优势。
    美国著名的火箭专家、“探险者”人造卫星设计人布劳恩说，苏联第三个卫星的发射证明，“俄国人在这场竞赛中确是跑在我们的前面。”他认为，把第三个人造卫星送上天，可能是一个推力至少是一十三万五千公斤到二十二万五千公斤的强大的洲际弹道火箭。美国陆军导弹负责人梅德拉斯也承认，苏联发射的第三个卫星证实了他们已掌握向月球发射火箭的技术。
    英国许多科学家对苏联的火箭技术表示赞扬。英国星际协会主席加特兰说，苏联新卫星的重量说明了苏联人已拥有一种威力超过洲际导弹的火箭。
