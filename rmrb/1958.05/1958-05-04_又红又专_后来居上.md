Our country is in the midst of the two great high tides of rectification and construction. It is particularly gratifying to commemorate the thirty-ninth anniversary of the great historical "May Fourth" Movement at this time of vigorous national leap forward.

The victories brought to us by the Great Leap Forward make it clearer that socialism can not only be built, but can be built ahead of schedule. Since socialism can be built ahead of schedule, the days of building communism are not far off. There is no doubt that this generation of young people in our country will shoulder the task of building communism. This generation of young people in our country should have such aspirations, to completely and cleanly eliminate poverty and backwardness from our land, and to make our country stand at the forefront of the world. This is a greater and more arduous task than the opposition to imperialism and feudalism in the "May Fourth" era. Great goals produce great strength, and this generation of young people in our country must become the most loyal, most resolute, and most capable team to realize this great task.

Our current era is the socialist era, the greatest era in human history. The socialist era must produce new people who are suitable for the needs of their era. One of the characteristics that distinguishes this new type of person from all past heroes and heroines is that they are thoroughly imbued with the spirit of collectivism, and have the determination and practical skills to realize the communist ideal. This is the unity of red and expert, the unity of politics and profession, and the unity of physical and mental labor.

Socialism does not allow the existence of bourgeois individualism. Those who cling to this kind of thinking will only play a negative and destructive role in socialism, and will eventually become the gravediggers of capitalism. Therefore, everyone who sincerely wants to move towards socialism must first make the most thorough break with bourgeois individualism. There are still some young people who have such a wrong idea that although individualism is not good, it can sometimes be used as a driving force for their own progress. These young people do not understand that individualism has no revolutionary nature in the socialist era, only reactionary nature. Some people with serious individualism have finally degenerated into rightists, which is the best proof. Individualism is like a lone boat in the sea, which capsizes at the first touch of wind and waves. Collectivism is like an atomic icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean, which can destroy any solid ice. Is it better to sit in a small boat and wobble, or to sit on an atomic icebreaker and ride the wind and waves forward? The matter is indeed very clear.

The struggle between individualism and collectivism is prominently manifested in the issue of red and expert. After the great debate on red and expert, most of the young people in our country have realized that politics is the commander, and politics is the soul. Ignoring politics and being only expert but not red is a dangerous road. However, some young people have not completely abandoned the idea of "expert first, then red." They say that some intellectuals from the old society can still serve socialism because they have some expertise. They think that they can still take this road today. Therefore, they are always not enthusiastic and thorough in transforming themselves. In fact, they want to be only expert but not red, and want to bring bourgeois ideas into socialist society. This idea is contrary to the laws of historical development. These young people do not understand that some people took the road of being only expert but not red, and did not make up for the lesson until after liberation, and only slowly became red. That was a product of the old society. When they made up for the lesson, they experienced a painful process. Others, because of the needs of the cruel class struggle, became experts in military affairs, politics, and mass movements, and gradually became scientific and technological experts in a certain field after liberation through hard study. These people have also gone through a much more arduous struggle than young people when they re-learned. The situation has fundamentally changed now. This generation of young people has good social conditions that are many times better than their predecessors. They should and can be both red and expert at the same time. There is no need to repeat the painful road of the past.

Red and expert cannot be separated, nor can they be prioritized. For example, after the Party Central Committee put forward the call to march towards science in 1956, it aroused a wave of hard study among the vast number of young people. But with the same hard study, there were two different attitudes and, as a result, two different results. Some people marched towards science for the sake of socialism, so they always put the needs of the country first, and closely integrated learning with doing a good job and improving their professional skills. As a result, both their work and study progressed rapidly. Some people marched towards science for the sake of personal fame and gain, so they started from personal fame and gain, were unwilling to study political theory, were unwilling to take on social work, and did not seriously improve their professional skills. They were worried about gains and losses all day long, and always thought the grass was greener on the other side. As a result, they did not do a good job in either work or study. If it is said that in the past, people lived in the old society and could focus on being expert through individual efforts, then today, in a collectivist society, an individualist who works alone can never be more expert or deeper than a collectivist. Red and expert are inseparable. It is wrong to oppose red and expert.

In the socialist era, we must wage war against the earth and wage war against the universe. As a young person in the socialist era, it is naturally very important to be proficient in one's own profession and to do one's job diligently, but it is not enough. The mission that history has given to this generation of young people in our country is to master all the latest scientific achievements in the world, otherwise catching up with and surpassing Britain will become empty talk. How can we achieve this? The method is to study hard and practice bravely. Use politics to drive professional work, and use revolutionary drive to promote revolutionary dedication. The ancients cherished every inch of time, and we should cherish every minute. We must learn seriously, diligently, humbly, and respectfully from workers and peasants, from revolutionary predecessors, from scientists, from all knowledgeable people, and from our predecessors, and inherit all useful knowledge. Any arrogance or lack of humility in this regard is unacceptable. People who are arrogant, conceited, and think they know everything will not achieve great things. Moreover, it should also be recognized that the world is constantly progressing, knowledge is constantly enriched, and past experience is inevitably limited. Therefore, this generation of young people must not be satisfied with learning from past experience and inheriting old culture, let alone lying on books, finding answers from books, and living on other people's conclusions. This means that we must both inherit and create. Without inheritance, history will not be interrupted. Without creation, society cannot develop. To create, we must break superstitions, practice bravely, and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. We must bravely throw ourselves into labor and various struggles to be tempered, to increase knowledge, to increase talent, and to create new things. Civilization is created by people. As long as it conforms to the laws of the development of things and is not wild speculation, people have the power to realize their ideals. The people can not only liberate themselves, but also liberate the endless power of nature. In the "May Fourth" Movement that took place thirty-nine years ago, people proposed to overthrow imperialism and feudalism. At that time, many people thought it was impossible, but later it was done. Later, people shouted to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek. Some people were not confident at that time, but later it was also done. When Marx was alive, he said that the whole world would take the road of communism. At that time, many people did not believe it, and some even regarded it as heresy. But now more and more people believe it, because there are already more than a dozen countries in the world, and one-third of the world's population has embarked on this road. Social phenomena are like this, and natural phenomena are also like this. People want to go to heaven, and as a result, there will be airplanes and rockets; people want to have clairvoyance, and there will be television and fax; people want to have sharp ears, and there will be radio. Which of these things was not thought of and done by people? Youth is the era of people's vigorous energy and brilliance. As long as the direction is right, as long as they are willing to work hard, they can do earth-shattering things.

Since ancient times, many of those who have made great achievements, established new schools of thought, and new sects have been young people. Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty was the commander-in-chief at the age of eighteen, Yue Fei of the Southern Song Dynasty built the Yue Family Army in his twenties, Marx drafted the Communist Manifesto at the age of twenty-nine, and most of the leaders of our party were also engaged in revolution when they were young. Today is very different from the past. It is not that "today is not as good as yesterday" as the rightists say, but that today is incomparable to the past. The socialist era is an era of emerging heroes. This kind of hero is different from those individualist heroes who "seek fame and fortune" for themselves. They are true collectivist heroes who dare to go through fire and water for the benefit of the people. All those who cherish the lofty ideal of communism always place their hopes on young people, hoping that this generation will be better than the previous generation, and that the next generation will be stronger than this generation; hoping that their descendants can grow into thousands of such heroes. The young people of our country must have the spirit of surpassing their predecessors, must advance towards the goal of being red and expert, must surpass their predecessors, and create great achievements for the lofty cause of communism. Then people will say: "To count the outstanding figures, look to this day."

### 又红又专　后来居上

    又红又专　后来居上
    我们的国家正处在整风、建设两大高潮中。在这生气蓬勃、全民大跃进的时候，我们来纪念具有伟大历史意义的“五四”运动三十九周年，特别使人感到高兴。
    全民大跃进给我们带来的胜利，使人更清楚地看到社会主义不但可以建成，而且可以提早建成。既然社会主义可以提早建成，那么建设共产主义的日子也就不是很远的了。我国这一代青年将担负起建设共产主义的任务，是没有疑问的了。我国这代青年应当有这样的抱负，把贫穷落后从我们的国土上彻底干净地消灭掉，使我们的国家站在世界各国的前列。这是比“五四”时代反对帝国主义、封建主义更加伟大更加艰巨的任务。伟大的目的产生伟大的力量，我国这代青年一定要成为实现这个伟大任务的最忠诚、最坚决、最能干的一支队伍。
    我们今天的时代，是社会主义的时代，是人类历史上最伟大的时代。社会主义时代要产生适合自己时代需要的新人。这种新人区别于过去一切英雄豪杰的一个特色，是全身都浸透着集体主义精神，有为实现共产主义理想的决心和实际本领。这也就是红和专的统一，政治和业务的统一，体力劳动和脑力劳动的统一。
    社会主义不允许资产阶级个人主义思想存在。死抱着这种思想的人，只会对社会主义起消极的和破坏的作用，最后成为资本主义的殉葬者。因此，每一个想真诚走向社会主义的人，必须首先对资产阶级个人主义思想作最彻底的决裂。现在还有些青年有这样一种错误的想法，他们认为个人主义虽然不好，但有时还可以作为自己前进的动力。这些青年不了解，个人主义在社会主义时代已经没有一点革命性，而只有反动性了。一些有着严重的个人主义终于堕落成为右派的人，就是最好的证明。个人主义好比大海中的孤舟，遇到风浪，一碰就翻。集体主义好比北冰洋里的原子破冰船，任凭什么坚冰都可以摧毁。是坐在小船里摇摇晃晃好呢，还是坐在原子破冰船上乘风破浪一往直前好呢，事情的确是再清楚不过了。
    个人主义和集体主义的斗争，突出地表现在红与专的问题上。经过红与专的大辩论，我国青年大部分已经认识到政治是统帅，政治是灵魂。忽视政治，只专不红，这条道路是危险的道路。可是有些青年却还没有完全抛掉“先专后红”的想法。他们说，从旧社会来的一些知识分子，因为有些专长，还不是照样可以为社会主义服务。他们以为今天还可以走这条路。所以他们对改造自己就总是不热心，不彻底，这实际上是想只专不红，想把资产阶级思想带进社会主义社会。这种想法是违背历史发展规律的。这些青年不了解，有些人走了只专不红的道路，直到解放后才来补课，才慢慢红起来，那是旧社会的产物，在他们补课的时候，经历的是痛苦的过程；而另一些人因为残酷的阶级斗争的需要，成了军事、政治和群众运动的专家，到解放后刻苦学习又逐渐成为某一方面的科学技术专家。这些人在重新学习的时候，也经过了比青年人要艰苦得多的斗争。现在的情况已经根本改变，这一代的青年有着比前辈不知优越多少倍的良好的社会条件，应当而且有可能同时作到又红又专，不必再去重走过去那样痛苦的道路了。
    红和专是不能分开来的，也是不能分先后的。比如1956年党中央提出向科学进军的号召以后，在广大青年中曾经激起努力学习的热潮。但同是刻苦学习，却有两种不同的态度并由此而产生两种不同的结果。有的人是为了社会主义而向科学进军，所以他一切先看国家的需要，使学习和搞好工作、搞好业务密切结合，结果是工作学习都进步得很快。有的人却是为了个人的名利向科学进军，所以他就从个人名利出发，不愿学习政治理论，不愿担任社会工作，也没有认真地搞好业务，整天患得患失，这山望着那山高，结果工作、学习都搞不好。如果说在过去，人们生活在旧社会，个人努力，可以专一点的话，那末，今天，在集体主义的社会，个人主义的单干户，无论如何也不能比集体主义的人专得更好更深。红和专是分不开的。把红和专对立起来是不对的。
    社会主义时代，要向地球开战，向宇宙开战。作为一个社会主义时代的青年精通自己本行业务，勤勤恳恳地做好自己份内的工作，自然是很重要的，但是还不够，历史给我国这代青年的使命是要掌握世界一切最新的科学成就，否则赶上和超过英国就会成为空谈。怎样才能够做到这一点呢？办法就是刻苦的学习，勇敢的实践。通过政治去带动业务，用革命的干劲来推动革命的钻劲。古人惜寸阴，我们应当惜分阴。要认真、刻苦、虚心、恭恭敬敬地向工人农民学习，向革命前辈学习，向科学家学习，向一切有知识的人学习，向我们的前人学习，把一切有用的知识都继承下来。在这方面有一点骄傲，有一点不谦虚，都是要不得的。自高自大、目空一切的人是不会有大成就的。而且，还应该认识到，世界是不断进步的，知识是不断丰富的，过去的经验，总不免有它的局限性。因此，这一代的青年决不能以学习过去的经验、继承旧有文化为满足，更不能躺在书本上，从书本上找答案，靠别人的结论生活。这就是说，我们既要继承，又要独创。有继承，历史才不会中断，有独创，社会才能发展。而要独创，就必须破除迷信，勇敢实践，要敢想、敢说、敢干。要勇敢地投身到劳动中、各种斗争中去受锻炼，去增长知识，增长才干，创造新事物。文明是人创造出来的，只要合乎事物发展规律，不是胡思乱想，人是有力量实现自己的理想的。人民不仅可以解放自己，也可以解放自然界无穷无尽的力量。三十九年以前发生的“五四”运动，人们提出打倒帝国主义、封建主义，当时许多人认为办不到，后来办到了。以后人们又喊出要打倒国民党蒋介石反动统治，当时有些人也是没有信心的，后来也办到了。马克思在世时，说全世界都要走共产主义的道路，当时很多人不相信，有的人还把它当作异端邪说，但是现在相信的人大大多起来了，因为世界上已有十几个国家，全世界三分之一的人口走上了这条道路了。社会现象如此，自然现象也如此。人们想上天，结果就会有飞机和火箭的出现；人们想有千里眼，就有电视传真的出现；人们想有顺风耳，就有无线电的出现。所有这些，哪一件不是人想出来做出来的。青年时代，是人的精力充沛、才华焕发的时代，只要他方向对头，只要他肯钻肯干，是可以干出惊天动地的事情来的。
    从古以来，建大功立大业的，创立新学派、新教派的，很多都是青年人。唐朝李世民十八岁当总司令，南宋岳飞二十几岁建岳家军，马克思二十九岁起草共产党宣言，我们党的大部分领袖也是年轻时候闹革命的。今天和过去的时代已经大不相同了，不是右派分子所说的“今不如昔”，而是今非昔比。社会主义时代是英雄辈出的时代，这种英雄和那些为了个人“扬名显身”的个人英雄主义者不同，是真正的集体主义英雄，是为了人民的利益而敢于赴汤蹈火的英雄。而一切怀有共产主义崇高理想的人，也总是把希望寄托在青年身上，希望这一代比上一代好，下一代又比这一代强；希望自己的后代能生长出成千成万这样的英雄。我国青年一定要有后来居上的气概，一定要向红透专深的目标前进，要青出于蓝而胜于蓝，为共产主义的崇高事业创造出丰功伟绩，那时人们将会说：“数风流人物，还看今朝”。
