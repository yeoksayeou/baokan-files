　　Soviet Rocket Technology Expert in Poland Says
　　Soviet Union Prepares to Launch Third Satellite
    Also Prepares to Launch Rocket to the Moon
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 14th. According to a Polish Press Agency report: Yuri Pobedonostsev, a Soviet rocket technology expert currently visiting Poland, said on the 12th that the Soviet Union intends to launch more artificial satellites during the International Geophysical Year. The work of launching the third artificial satellite is currently under preparation. It will be equipped with instruments that the previous two artificial satellites did not have, and it will also be heavier than before. At the same time, Soviet scientists are preparing to launch a rocket to the moon.
    Pobedonostsev made these remarks at a meeting of the Polish Astronautical Society. In his speech entitled "The Launch of Soviet Artificial Satellites and Some Observation Results," he said that Soviet scientists have fully mastered the technology of strictly controlled, long-term combustion processes in rocket combustion chambers. Because of this, they are able to launch rockets with very large payloads into space. For example, in February of this year, the Soviet Union launched a single-stage rocket carrying instruments weighing one and a half tons to an altitude of 470 kilometers. In addition, a rocket weighing 2,200 kilograms was also launched.

　　苏联火箭技术专家在波兰说
　　苏联准备发射第三个卫星
    同时也准备向月球发射一个火箭
    新华社华沙14日电　据波兰通讯社报道：正在波兰访问的苏联火箭技术专家尤里·波别多诺斯切夫12日说，苏联打算在国际地球物理年期间发射更多的人造卫星。发射第三个人造卫星的工作目前正在准备，它将装备前两个人造卫星没有装过的仪器，而且也将比以前的重。同时苏联科学家正在准备向月球发射一个火箭。
    波别多诺斯切夫是在波兰宇宙飞行协会的一次会议上说这番话的。他在题为“苏联人造卫星的发射及某些观测结果”的演说中说，苏联科学家完全掌握了火箭燃烧室中的受到严格控制能够长期进行的燃烧过程的技术。正因为如此，他们就有可能将载重量很大的火箭发射上天，例如今年2月间，苏联就曾将一个载有重达一吨半的仪器的单级火箭发射到四百七十公里的高空。此外，还发射过一个重达二千二百公斤的火箭。
