Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Jie reports: After the rectification campaign and the “Double Anti” movement, the ideological and political consciousness of Shanghai workers has greatly improved, and the spirit of independent innovation of daring to think and act has been greatly promoted, fully demonstrating the unique style of the working class.

First create, then write it in books

Daring to think and act, to do things that no one has done before, is a very distinct characteristic after the liberation of workers' minds. Xu Zuying, an ordinary electroplating worker at the Huafu Fountain Pen Factory, proposed last year to study reducing the amount of gold in the gold-plating composition of the Hero pen cover. However, the technicians in the factory told him: "It's impossible. There is no such theoretical basis in books at home and abroad." The night school teacher also said that he only had a junior high school education and lacked the basic knowledge to study these issues. However, he was unconvinced. He thought: Mr. Lu Xun said that the road is made by people, why must we follow the rules only when it is in books? Can't we create first and then write it in books? Do we have to wait a few years before reducing the amount of gold used? The factory director and the secretary of the Party branch supported his idea and encouraged him to be bold in creating. He and the ingredient worker, Gu Zhenhua, experimented again and again, failed again and again, and after more than thirty consecutive experiments, they finally recently reduced the amount of gold in the gold-plating composition of the pen cover from 92% to 80%. The Huafu Fountain Pen Factory alone can save four hundred taels of gold a year.

The story of Pan Ayao, an old worker at Yongxin Hardware Factory, improving the "mandrel" of the seamless steel pipe piercing machine is also a widely circulated example of this period. The "mandrel" of the seamless steel pipe piercing machine in this factory is often prone to softening (becoming soft) at high temperatures, and the piercing efficiency is very low. Because of this, the factory had great difficulties in production this year. The factory leaders ran to more than a dozen large and small steel factories in Shanghai, and consulted experts from Anshan Iron and Steel and professors from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, but none of them solved the problem. However, Master Pan Ayao silently solved the problem through many experiments. He put a hole in the "mandrel" and passed in a cold water pipe to prevent the "mandrel" from softening, which immediately increased the production efficiency of each "mandrel" by 149 times. As a result, the factory's output of small seamless steel pipes this year jumped from 860 tons to 7,000 to 10,000 tons; and the "mandrel" does not need to be made of expensive alloy steel, but can be made of heat-resistant steel.

Breaking old rules and bad habits, establishing a spirit of cooperation

Treating production with the communist spirit of collaboration is another sign of the great improvement of the ideological consciousness of the Shanghai working class. Under the general slogan of "Striving to shorten the cycle of ship repair and construction," the employees of Jiangnan Shipyard have developed a high degree of revolutionary initiative, eliminated many rules and regulations that are incompatible with production, and liberated productive forces. In the past, workers worked according to the work order (construction order). The lifting and transportation workshop, which specializes in serving other workshops, used to have three "don'ts": don't do it without a work order, don't do it if the plan isn't submitted three days in advance, and don't do it if you contact them after 4 pm. Now, everyone has abandoned the work order, and under the general goal of the factory, the lifting and transportation workshop proposed "There are vehicles when you need them, there are people when you need them, and we are available whenever you call." And the power of dispatching is delegated to the team. The technical personnel of the process and design departments all went to the production site to direct, "The ship does not leave the dock, the people do not leave the ship," and worked with the workers. The sales staff brought the inventory books to settle in the workshop, and if they needed any materials, they could get them quickly with just a word. In this way, six ships in the factory went out of the dock ahead of schedule for the first time in March. It used to take eighteen months to build a 5,000-ton freighter, but now they are striving to complete it in nine months.

Many factories competing with each other cooperate and support each other in the new spirit. China Paper Company knew that Lihua Paper Factory was catching up with its competitors, but when it heard that Lihua Factory's No. 4 paper machine was speeding up and lacked a speed-changing motor, it took the initiative to send one of its own 25-horsepower motors. Lihua Paper Factory also lent a 90-horsepower speed-changing motor on a calendering machine to Hezong Paper Factory to support them in speeding up to catch up with the advanced.

Compressing working hours to remove the stumbling block to the Great Leap Forward

The nationwide agricultural production Great Leap Forward that began in the winter of last year brought unprecedentedly heavy tasks to Shanghai's industrial production, especially the electromechanical industry. This year, Shanghai's total industrial output value is expected to increase sharply by 35% compared with last year, and the output of many heavy industrial factories is jumping up by multiples, several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times. Faced with this situation, the workers of many factories took the initiative to request the compression of working hour quotas to ensure "increased production without increasing manpower" to support the leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production. In mid-March, after discussion by the workers, fifteen heavy industrial factories in Jiangning District compressed more than 4.5 million working hours this year, compressing more than 50% of the original working hour quota. The workers of the Shanghai Motor Factory called the old working hour quota a stumbling block to the Leap Forward. If this stumbling block is not removed, production cannot continue to leap forward. They recently compressed the working hour quota by 24%.

Building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically

The workers' general slogan is to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. The wood press produced by the jointly owned Da'an Machine Factory has increased its planned target from four sets to nine sets this year. The factory's traveling crane was not enough, so the workers used their spare time to design, prepare materials, and manufacture one themselves. If the machine equipment was insufficient, they went to the old goods store to buy old machine tool frames to modify.

Many small factories with unknown names and large factories have launched a friendly competition of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. When China Mineral Raw Materials Factory, with only 83 employees, sent a challenge letter to Jiangnan Shipyard, the entire Jiangnan factory was shocked, and they all proposed to learn the spirit of diligence and thrift from China Mineral Raw Materials Factory.

The Tongren Alloy Factory, which manufactured the first batch of manganese copper wire and seamless nickel tubes and other important new products for our country, is a typical "lane factory" in Shanghai. In the past few years, it has produced many new products urgently needed by the country in its factory building with an area of only 760 square meters. For example, their silver-tungsten alloy powder packaging workshop was converted from a bathroom, and the factory director's office is located in a small building made of wooden boards, with a total area of only 40 square meters, but they proudly call it the "office building". Last year, the factory's total output value increased by more than double compared with the previous year, and the profits turned over to the state increased by nearly six times. This year, they have put forward a heroic plan: strive for a profit target of one million yuan, and earn back ten Tongren Alloy Factories with one year's profit.

    上海工人的共产主义风格
    敢独创重协作能克己尚勤俭
    据新华社上海2日电　新华社记者高洁报道：经过整风和双反运动，上海工人的思想政治觉悟大大提高，敢想敢作的独创精神大大发扬，充分显示了工人阶级特有的风格。
    先创造，再把它写到书本上去
    敢想敢干，做前人所未有的事业，这是工人思想解放以后一个十分鲜明的特点。华孚金笔厂的一个普通电镀工徐祖英，去年就提出想研究把英雄笔套镀金成分中的黄金用量减少。可是，厂里的技术人员告诉他：“不行的，中外书本上都没有过这种理论根据。”夜校教师也说他只有初中程度，研究这些问题还缺乏基础知识。可是他听了很不服气。他想：鲁迅先生讲过，路是人走出来的，为什么一定要书本上有了才去照章办事？难道我们不能先创造，然后再把它写上书本吗？难道要等几年再来降低黄金用量吗？厂长和党支部书记支持了他的想法，鼓励他大胆创造。他和配料工顾振华一起，试验一次又一次，失败一次又一次，连续试验了三十多次，终于在最近把笔套镀金成分中的黄金用量从92％减少到80％。单是一个华孚金笔厂，一年就可以节约四百两黄金。
    永鑫五金厂的老工人潘阿耀改进无缝钢管穿孔机“顶头”的事，也是这一时期人们传颂很广的例子。这个工厂的无缝钢管穿孔机“顶头”，在高温下常常容易发烊（变软），穿孔效率很低。由于这一原因，这个厂今年生产发生了很大困难。工厂领导干部跑遍了上海的十多个大小钢厂，请教过鞍钢的专家和北京钢铁工业学院的教授，都没有解决。可是，潘阿耀老师傅不声不响地经过多次试验解决了这个难题。他把“顶头”穿上孔，通进冷水管，防止“顶头”发烊，一下就使每只“顶头”的生产效率提高了一百四十九倍，全厂今年的小型无缝钢管产量因而从八百六十吨一跃到了七千吨到一万吨；制造“顶头”也不须用贵重的合金钢，用耐热钢就可以了。
    破陈规陋习　立协作精神
    以共产主义的协作精神对待生产，这是上海工人阶级思想觉悟大大提高的另一个标志。江南造船厂职工们在“一切为了缩短修造船周期而斗争”的总口号下，发挥了高度的革命主动精神，破除了许多和生产不相适应的规章制度，解放了生产力。过去，工人们按派工单（施工命令）办事。专门为其他车间服务的起重吊运车间，以往是三不做：没有派工单不做，三天以前不提计划不做，下午四点钟以后联系的事不做。现在，大家抛弃了派工单，在全厂总的奋斗目标下，起重吊运车间提出“要车有车，要人有人，随叫随到。”并且把调度权力下放到小组。工艺、设计科的技术人员都去到生产现场指挥，“船不离坞，人不离船”，和工人一起干。供销人员带着库存账册到车间落户，要什么材料，只要说一声，很快就可以拿来。就这样，全厂3月份有六条船破天荒地提前出了坞，造一条五千吨的货轮，过去要十八个月，现在九个月就要争取完成。
    很多互相竞赛的厂在新的精神下，互相协作，互相支持。中国版纸公司知道利华造纸厂是赶自己的对手，但当听到利华厂的四号造纸机加快车速后缺少一只变速马达时，就主动把自己厂里的一只二十五马力的马达送去。利华造纸厂也把一只轧光机上的九十变速马达借给合众造纸厂，支援他们加快赶先进。
    压缩工时定额搬掉跃进的绊脚石
    从去年冬季开始的全国农业生产大跃进，给上海工业生产，特别是机电工业带来空前繁重的任务。今年上海工业总产值预计比去年猛增35％，很多重工业工厂产量成倍、几倍、十几倍、甚至几十倍地往上跳。面对这样的形势，很多厂的工人主动提出要求压缩工时定额，保证“增产增事不增人”，来支援全国工农业生产的跃进。江宁区十五个重工业工厂在3月中旬就经过工人群众讨论，今年可以压缩四百五十多万个工时，压缩了原工时定额的50％以上。上海电机厂工人称旧的工时定额是跃进中的绊脚石，不搬掉这块绊脚石，生产就不能继续跃进。他们最近压缩了工时定额24％。
    多快好省地建设社会主义
    工人们的总口号是多快好省地建设社会主义。公私合营大安机器厂生产的木压机，今年计划指标从四套增加到九套，厂里的行车不够用了，工人们就利用业余时间，自己设计，自己备料，自己制造了一架，机器设备不足，他们就到旧货商店买了旧的机床架子来改装。
    许多名不经传的小厂和大厂展开了勤俭办企业的友谊竞赛。只有八十三名职工的中国矿产原料厂把挑战书送到江南造船厂的时候，使江南厂全厂震惊，纷纷提出要向中国矿产原料厂学习勤俭节约的精神。
    为我国制造出第一批锰铜丝、无缝镍管等重要新产品的铜仁合金工厂，是上海一个典型的“弄堂工厂”，他们几年来在仅有七百六十多平方公尺面积的厂房里，因陋就简地生产出来许多国家迫切需要的新产品。例如他们的银钨合金粉包装车间是一间浴室改的，厂长办公室设在一座用木板钉成的小楼上，总共面积不过四十平方公尺，他们却自豪地称之为“办公大楼”。去年，这个厂的生产总值比前年增加一倍多，上缴利润增加近六倍。今年，他们又提出了豪迈的计划：争取利润指标达到一百万元，要以一年的利润挣回十个铜仁合金厂。
