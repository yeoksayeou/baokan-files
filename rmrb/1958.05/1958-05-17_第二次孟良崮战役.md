On the eve of the eleventh anniversary of the Menglianggu Campaign, this reporter, accompanied by Major Liu Wenlong of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who participated in the main attack on Menglianggu, climbed the recently treated Menglianggu and its surrounding hills. This place was once world-renowned for the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's "Royal Forest Army," the 74th Division; now, it has been enhanced by the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers launching a second battle here—a battle against nature.

Our party of five, starting from Daizhuang and ascending the main peak of Menglianggu, followed a route that resembled a horseshoe. Although eleven years have passed, on any hill in this area, one can still find the remnants of the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's "Royal Forest Army": human bones, horse bones, Thompson submachine gun shells, Chiang's army collar badges and cap badges... Major Liu Wenlong also saw a Yixing clay teapot spout, and he smiled and said that this was likely a "gift" airdropped by Chiang's army planes back then.

Within the horseshoe-shaped area we traversed, in stark contrast to the remnants of Chiang's army's annihilation, were: fish-scale pits, interception ditches, and water storage ponds covering the mountains and plains like lines of defense, surrounding Menglianggu and other peaks. From a distance, they resembled the scale armor worn by ancient warriors. These new projects were arranged in an orderly and aesthetically pleasing manner. In the mountain gullies, the newly built sand dams and valley terraces were mostly made of huge stones, with dam walls about one meter thick and a suitable slope, making it impossible for even a particularly large flood to move them.

As we walked and talked, we discussed the soil erosion situation in this mountainous area. Guo Shuji, director of the Office of the Yinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that according to the recollections of elderly people in their sixties and seventies, there used to be trees and crops growing on the mountains in this area. The Sha River from Daizhuang to Menglianggu was only ten to twenty meters wide decades ago, but now it is more than four hundred meters wide. Since liberation, the local people have put in tremendous labor to manage the Menglianggu mountainous area. The more than two thousand mu of pine trees planted on the west side of the main peak of Menglianggu in 1952 are now more than one person tall, a lush green. However, due to the lack of manpower in the mountainous area, it is difficult for them to fundamentally manage it on their own.

In March of this year, Shandong Province convened a provincial mountainous area construction conference, where it was decided that the troops would be responsible for the management of Menglianggu. After accepting the task, the entire army regarded the management of Menglianggu as the second Battle of Menglianggu. At the mobilization meeting for the march to Menglianggu and in subsequent practical actions, all officers and soldiers expressed their determination to fight against nature and conquer Menglianggu with the spirit of the old big brother troops annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's "Royal Forest Army," the 74th Division.

Throughout the entire mountain management battle, commanders at all levels, just like during wartime operations, set up their command posts on the mountain. At the beginning of the project, the command post issued a call: all officers should work hard for three days to become mountain management technicians; all soldiers should work hard for seven days to become mountain management experts. All officers also led by example in their labor. Wang Anping, the company commander of a certain company, led a five-person shock team and created a record of 57.8 cubic meters of earth moved per person on the last day of the project, which was more than seven times the labor efficiency of civilian workers. Jing Yonghe, the company commander of the command company of a certain unit, led eleven soldiers and built two valley terraces capable of storing more than one hundred and fifty cubic meters of water in three days.

Driven by the exemplary actions of the officers, the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of soldiers was even higher. Ninety-five slightly ill patients from a certain unit insisted on participating in the construction. They said, "When the old big brothers attacked Menglianggu, they didn't leave the front line with minor injuries. Today, when we build Menglianggu, we won't leave the mountain with minor illnesses."

In the last few days of the project, the main peak of Menglianggu was filled with the sound of clanging hammers and continuous artillery fire, just like the general offensive against Chiang's army back then. This was the continuous artillery fire set off by the first and second companies of a certain unit responsible for managing the main peak of Menglianggu for opening mountains and quarrying stones. They used the more than two thousand cubic meters of stone blasted and the stones left on the mountain from Chiang's army's construction of fortifications to build two retaining walls to slow down water and prevent sand erosion. They also built roads with steps around the main peak of Menglianggu.

On Qingming Festival, before starting construction, all troops lined up in companies facing the main peak of Menglianggu to pay their respects to the revolutionary martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves to annihilate Chiang's army. They swore that they would learn from the spirit of the martyrs in eliminating harm for the people, transform Menglianggu from a poor mountain and bad water into a green mountain and clear water, and turn the root of disaster into the root of happiness.

This Menglianggu campaign, like previous campaigns, received enthusiastic support from the local government and the vast number of people. The people of Yinan, hearing that the troops were going to manage the mountains, rushed to widen the roads for several nights as early as late March; on the day the troops set out, welcome slogans were posted on the walls and trees of villages along the seventy-mile route north from Qingtuo Temple; many villages set up tea stations, and grandfathers and grandmothers poured tea and water for the troops just like they did when supporting the front lines in the past; when the troops arrived at Daizhuang, they were greeted by nearly a thousand people in the rain.

In the second Battle of Menglianggu, the People's Liberation Army, with selfless labor, spent more than 59,000 workdays in just thirteen and a half days, building a complete flood control and sand retention system on ten thousand mu of barren mountains according to different terrains, digging 91,960 fish-scale pits, interception ditches, horizontal ditches, and interception troughs, building 6,641 dikes and valley terraces, and consolidating 2,063 reverse-slope terraced fields, completing 213,336 and a half cubic meters of earthwork, which gave the people of Shandong Province, especially the people in the Yimeng mountainous area, unlimited confidence in mountain management. The people of Yinan County are determined to complete the task of managing 350,000 mu of mountains in the county before the flood season. In some of the fish-scale pits dug by the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on Menglianggu and in the consolidated reverse-slope terraced fields, the local people have sown tree seeds and other seeds, and they are determined to turn the heroic Menglianggu into a flower and fruit mountain, and turn the terraced fields and valley fields in this area into rice and grain fields, so that the land where the heroes have worked so hard will bear fruitful results.

　　第二次孟良崮战役
　　新华社记者　林麟　王建林
    在孟良崮战役十一周年前夕，记者由当年参加主攻孟良崮的中国人民解放军刘文龙少校等陪同，登上了刚刚治理不久的孟良崮和它附近的山头。这里曾因全歼蒋家“御林军”七十四师而闻名于世；如今，又由于解放军官兵在这里发起第二次战役——向大自然作战，而使它增添光彩。
    我们一行五人，由岱庄跨上孟良崮主峰的路线恰像一个马蹄形。虽然时间已过去十一年，在这一带的任何一个山头上，仍然可以发现蒋家“御林军”复没的遗迹：人骨、马骨、汤姆枪弹壳、蒋军领章和帽徽……。刘文龙少校还看到一个宜兴泥壶嘴，他笑着说，这很可能是当年蒋军飞机空投的“礼物”。
    在我们走过的马蹄形地区内，和蒋军复没遗迹形成鲜明对照的是：漫山遍野的鱼鳞坑、截水沟、蓄水池像一道道的防线将孟良崮和其它山峰团团围住，远远看去，它又像古代武士身上披的鳞甲。这些新工程排列有序，整齐美观。在山沟，新修的拦沙坝和谷坊，大都用巨石砌成，坝墙厚约一公尺，坡度适宜，不是特大洪水，休想动它一下。
    我们边走边谈，谈到这一带山地的水土流失情况。中共沂南县委办公室郭淑吉主任说，据六、七十岁的老人回忆，这一带的山上本来是有树木、长庄稼的。从岱庄到孟良崮的沙河，数十年前只一、二十公尺宽，而现在它已有四百多公尺宽了。解放以来，当地人民群众对治理孟良崮山区，曾付出了巨大的劳动。1952年在孟良崮主峰西面种植的二千多亩松树，现在已有一人多高，一片青翠。但是，由于山区人力不足，要靠他们自己的力量来根本治理，是有许多困难的。
    今年3月间，山东省召开了全省山区建设会议，会上确定由部队包治孟良崮。他们接受任务后，全军上下都把治理孟良崮当作第二次孟良崮战役。在向孟良崮进军的誓师大会上以及以后的实际行动中，全体官兵都表示要以老大哥部队歼灭蒋家“御林军”七十四师的精神，向大自然作战，征服孟良崮。
    在整个治山战斗中，各级指挥员也像战时指挥作战一样，把指挥所设在山上。工程一开始，指挥所就提出号召：全体军官苦战三天，成为治山技术员；全体士兵苦战七天，成为治山能手。所有军官在劳动中也都以身作则，某连连长王安平率领的五人突击组，曾在工程最后的一天，创造了每人平均出土五七·八立方的最高纪录，超过民工劳动效率的七倍以上。某部指挥连连长敬永褐率领十一个战士，在三天内修起可蓄水一百五十多方的谷坊两座。
    在军官的模范行动带动下，广大士兵的劳动热情更加高涨。某部九十五名轻病号坚持参加施工，他们说：“当年老大哥攻打孟良崮时轻伤不下火线，今天我们建设孟良崮要轻病不下山”。
    在工程的最后几天，孟良崮的主峰上到处响起铿锵的锤钎冲击声和连珠般的排炮声，像是当年对蒋军发起总攻一样。这是包治孟良崮主峰的某部一、二连为开山采石而放的连珠炮。他们用炸裂的二千多立方石料和遗留在山上的当年蒋军修工事的石头，筑起两道围山缓水拦沙墙；他们还在孟良崮主峰的四周修上有阶梯的道路。
    在清明节那天，所有部队在开始施工前，分别以连为单位列队面向孟良崮主峰，向为歼灭蒋军而英勇牺牲的先烈们致哀。他们宣誓：要学习先烈们为民除害的精神，使孟良崮这穷山恶水变为青山绿水，使灾祸之根变为幸福之根。
    这次孟良崮战役也像历次战役一样，是得到地方政府和广大人民热情支援的。沂南人民听说部队要去治山，早在3月下旬就突击几个晚上加宽道路；在部队出发的那天，自青驼寺向北长达七十里的沿途村庄的墙上和树上，都贴了欢迎标语；许多村庄设有茶水站，大爷大娘仍像过去支援前线一样为部队倒茶倒水；部队到达岱庄时，受到近千群众的冒雨欢迎。
    解放军在第二次孟良崮战役中，以忘我的劳动，在短短十三天半内付出五万九千多个劳动日，在万亩荒山上依据不同地形修建了完整的防洪拦沙体系，共挖鱼鳞坑、截水沟、水平沟、截水槽九万一千九百六十个，筑塘坝、谷坊六千六百四十一个，整理倒坡梯田二千零六十三块，完成土方二十一万三千三百三十六又二分之一立方，给全山东人民特别是沂蒙山区人民治山增加了无限信心。沂南县人民决心在汛期前完成全县三十五万亩治山的任务。孟良崮上由解放军官兵挖成的部分鱼鳞坑和经过整理的倒坡梯田内，当地人民已播下树种和其它种子，他们决心把英雄的孟良崮变成花果山，把这一带的梯田、峪田变成米粮川，让英雄们辛勤劳动过的土地结出丰硕的果实。
