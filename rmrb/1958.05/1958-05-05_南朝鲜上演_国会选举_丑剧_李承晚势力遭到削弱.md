Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th - Seoul dispatch: The fourth "National Assembly election" in South Korea, held on the 2nd, has, as of tonight, revealed the results for two hundred and twenty-seven of the two hundred and thirty-three seats to be elected. Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party only secured one hundred and twenty-two seats, maintaining a slim majority exceeding half the seats, thus enabling them to continue to govern; the right-wing opposition Democratic Party secured seventy-seven seats, and independent candidates secured twenty-seven seats.

Prior to this "election," Syngman Rhee formulated a "National Assembly Election Law" favorable to his Liberal Party and carried out large-scale suppression and arrests, attempting to secure one hundred and fifty-six seats for his Liberal Party in the "election," that is, two-thirds of all seats in the National Assembly, in order to forcibly amend the constitutional provisions regarding the succession of the "presidential" position. Syngman Rhee wanted his confidant, "Speaker of the National Assembly" Lee Ki-poong, to be his successor so that the current "Vice President," Democratic Party leader Chang Myon, would not be able to succeed to the "presidency" upon Syngman Rhee's death, according to the current South Korean constitution.

The "election" results show that Syngman Rhee's conspiracy has failed. The Liberal Party will certainly not be able to maintain its one hundred and thirty-one seats in this "election" out of the two hundred and three seats it held in the previous "National Assembly" (which had thirty more seats than the previous one); while the Democratic Party is likely to jump from forty-six seats in the previous session to seventy-seven or more. United Press International said that the results of this "election" were a "major setback for Syngman Rhee's party."

The results of this election reflect the loss of popular support for Syngman Rhee's dark rule. United Press International said that many South Koreans were pleased with the weakening of Syngman Rhee's group's power.

    南朝鲜上演“国会选举”丑剧
    李承晚势力遭到削弱
    据新华社平壤4日电　汉城消息：2日举行的南朝鲜第四次“国会选举”，截至今天晚间，在预定选出的二百三十三个议席中已经有二百二十七席揭晓。李承晚的自由党只获得一百二十二席，以微弱多数超过半数议席而得以继续执政；右翼的反对党民主党获得七十七席，独立人士获得二十七席。
    在这次“选举”以前，李承晚制定了有利于他的自由党的“国会选举法”，并且进行了大规模的镇压和逮捕，企图使他的自由党在“选举”中获得一百五十六席，即国会全部议席的三分之二的法定多数，以便强行修改宪法中关于“总统”职位继任问题的规定。李承晚是想由他的亲信、“国会议长”李起鹏作为他的继承人，以使现任“副总统”的反对党民主党领袖张勉不能按照南朝鲜现行宪法的规定，在李承晚一旦死去时继任“总统”。
    “选举”结果表明，李承晚的阴谋已经遭到失败。自由党在这次“选举”中肯定不能维持住它在上届“国会”的二百零三个席位（这届国会较上届增加了三十席）中所把持的一百三十一席；而民主党则有可能由上届的四十六席跃至七十七席以上。美国的国际新闻社说，这次“选举”结果是“李承晚的党的重大挫折。”
    这次选举结果是李承晚黑暗统治丧失人心的反映。合众社说，许多南朝鲜人为李承晚集团势力的削弱感到高兴。
