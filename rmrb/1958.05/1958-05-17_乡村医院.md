　　Rural Hospital
　　By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao
    Leaving Qin County, going southwest for fifty li, you reach the old site of Gutongdi County – Gu County Town.
    This is a “four-nothing town”. The "Gu County District Hospital" is at the east end of the town. Farmers within a radius of dozens of miles can roll up their bedding and bring their own food to be hospitalized at any time, paying only five cents a day for hospitalization.
    I don't know if there are such hospitals in other places? But the "Gu County District Hospital" is indeed a very outstanding hospital in the countryside today, and it embodies the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in all aspects.

    Starting a Business with Diligence and Frugality, Running a Hospital with Diligence and Frugality
    The "Gu County District Hospital" was established on the basis of the original health center, according to the county's instructions. That was in August 1956.
    Though the sparrow is small, it has all its organs. The top name is a hospital, so it must have the business and equipment of a hospital. But at that time, there was no money or anything. What to do? They had to do it themselves. Their slogan was "One person is used as two, the business is not delayed, and people are freed up to work!" From then on, from the president to the chef, everyone started to carry water, mix mud, carry bricks and lift stones. In two months, they built the string of dilapidated courtyards allocated by the government. Inside, there were operating rooms, acupuncture rooms, and laboratories, as well as seven wards and isolation wards. In addition, an outpatient department and pharmacy were set up on the street.
    The hospital had a total of only ten staff members, each of whom also held other positions. For example, the president was also a doctor, the doctor was also an accountant, the nurse was also a lab technician, the pharmacist was also an outpatient registrar and cashier, and the chef was also a steward, etc. Although they were few in number, their tasks were not light. They were responsible for the prevention and treatment of diseases within eighty li of Gu County Town. This range included a total of eight townships, seventy-nine agricultural cooperatives, three hundred and eighty-five natural villages, eight thousand one hundred and sixteen households, and twenty-four thousand eight hundred and thirteen people.
    Among the five full-time or part-time Chinese and Western medicine doctors, only one graduated from a regular medical school – Taiyuan First Health School; the other four either practiced medicine while farming, or opened a pharmacy or worked as an apprentice in a health center. Their common characteristics were: they could adapt to the rural environment, consider the patients, and try to take the simplest and most economical methods to treat diseases, so they were generally welcomed and loved by the farmers.

　　Diligent Legs and Feet, Medicine Going to the Countryside and Up the Mountains
    As soon as the Gu County District Hospital was established, it determined its working policy, called "prevention first" and "diligent legs and feet, medicine going to the countryside and up the mountains." In the past year or so, they have organized a total of eight mobile treatments, carrying stethoscopes and medicine chests, traveling to more than one hundred and fifty small mountain villages and four water conservancy construction sites; during the busy farming season, doctors and other assistants, except for those on duty, all went to the countryside and up the mountains to mingle with the masses, treating diseases if there were any, and if not, participating in production while publicizing health knowledge.
    Usually, regardless of day or night, distance, as long as someone comes to ask, they are always there when called. In January this year, on a cold night, everyone was lying down, and suddenly someone knocked on the door. The doctors at the district hospital knew there was another emergency, and hurriedly got up. Young doctor Ma Shiliang took the lead and rushed to Li Xiaoer's house with him. At this time, the baby with a high fever was already unconscious. Ma Shiliang gave him gas with a self-made "native oxygen", and the baby slowly recovered. After some necessary diagnosis and treatment, the baby was completely well. Now, Li Xiaoer and his wife often say to people: "Thanks to the diligent legs and feet of the district hospital, our child's life was saved!"
    In the short three months from November last year to February this year, doctors at the district hospital made 164 house calls, an average of 32 calls per person. Even some things that didn't seem to be their responsibility, they always tried their best to do as long as they knew about them. Not long ago, a woman was returning to her old home in Tunliu County from southern Shanxi. When she passed by Gu County, her child suddenly fell ill. The district hospital immediately sent someone to the rescue upon hearing the news. At that time, it seemed that there was no hope. The child was convulsing all over, his lips were purple, and his eyes were rolling upwards. But the doctor still made every effort to save him, injecting antipyretics and performing acupuncture, which finally made the child slowly recover.

　　Simple Wards at Five Cents a Day
    In the countryside, in addition to emergency illnesses requiring house calls, there are many illnesses that require hospitalization. However, in the past, hospitals had too many rules and cost too much. When farmers got sick, they would rather delay at home than go to the hospital.
    In order to solve this problem, Gu County District Hospital built seven "simple wards." These wards are indeed extremely simple. Two of the seven rooms have two kang beds, and the remaining rooms each have two wooden plank beds, for a total of twenty beds. If farmers get sick and need to be hospitalized, they can register at the outpatient department (free for members of agricultural cooperatives with health care relations, and a registration fee of one cent for others) and move in; in case of emergency, they can be admitted first and then register. There are two ways to be hospitalized: one is to bring your own food, and the other is to eat with the hospital staff, which the patient can choose freely. Those who take the first method bring their bedding rolls and rice noodles to the hospital from home, and cook their own meals. The hospital does not make special requirements for the patient's diet, and completely follows local customs and suggests that they eat some easy-to-digest Sanhe noodles, Hezi rice, Ca Gedou, corn porridge, etc., which costs about the same as at home. In addition, they pay a hospitalization fee of five cents a day, which includes kang mat, lamp oil (now changed to electric lights), diagnosis and treatment, nursing, and all other expenses. Family members of seriously ill patients can also be hospitalized for nursing, and each person only pays five cents.
    In Shentou Village, fifteen miles away from Gu County, a young girl named Yang Yufang suffered from open pulmonary tuberculosis, with a daily sputum volume of four to five hundred CC. She couldn't eat anything, and was as skinny as a skeleton. Her family said she was dying. Dr. Zhang Xiuqing from the district hospital went to see her and felt there was still a glimmer of hope, but she needed to be hospitalized. Her family was worried about not being able to afford it. After the doctor's repeated explanations, they moved in. Under the careful treatment and nursing of the doctors and nurses, the girl's condition gradually improved. When she was discharged from the hospital, the affected area had completely calcified, and she had grown white and fat, weighing sixty-two kilograms. In addition to a small amount of medicine fees such as streptomycin, the food costs were about the same as at home.
    Last year, the "simple wards" admitted a total of 183 patients, of which 141 were completely cured (accounting for 77.05%), 21 had improved (accounting for 11.47%), and 14 had not deteriorated (accounting for 7.65%). The patients' illnesses were of all kinds. For example, a cowherd named Xu Hushan accidentally fell off a cliff and broke the back of his head. After the doctors at the district hospital performed emergency treatment, they performed a suturing operation, and he recovered and was discharged from the hospital in less than half a month. The farmers were very satisfied and said: "I never thought that our small hospital in this mountain ravine could perform abdominal surgeries and repair heads!" "Hospitalization includes rice and noodles, acupuncture for treatment costs less, simple wards are too convenient, really a good hospital for our farmers!"

　　The Center of Rural Health Care
    The outstanding feature of the Gu County District Hospital is that it is not only a hospital, but also the center of health care in the surrounding countryside.
    In the past year or so, the district hospital has trained a total of 118 health workers, 122 midwives, 37 acupuncturists, and 13 reserve medical officers for eight townships and 79 agricultural cooperatives; in addition, it has helped 29 doctors in the township to arrange work and establish health responsibility sections. In the eight large-scale mobile treatments and the busy farming season when they went to the countryside and up the mountains for treatment, they all absorbed local doctors in the township to participate.
    In May and June 1957, the district hospital also organized six doctors to conduct investigations on endemic diseases in eleven agricultural cooperatives and one middle school in Nanren Township. They found that 775 members (accounting for 19.60% of the total number of members) and 155 students (accounting for 48% of the total number of students) suffered from varying degrees of goiter due to iodine deficiency in drinking water. In addition, they found 42 children suffering from cretinism (rickets). The district hospital cooperated with the Gu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to produce more than 140 kilograms of iodized salt, which was distributed to patients with goiter. After three courses of treatment, half of the patients had improved. For patients with cretinism, the district hospital sent people to Changzhi to get some bone meal and dry thyroid and distributed them to them to eat, which was also very effective.
    Zhang Liusuo, the president of the district hospital, said that they will launch an attack on another endemic disease – childhood kala-azar this year.

　　乡村医院
　　本报记者　展潮
    出沁县城关，一直向西南走五十里，就到达古铜鞮县的旧址——故县镇了。
    这是个“四无镇”。镇子东头就是“故县地区医院”。方圆几十里地内的农民有了病，随时都可以卷上铺盖、带上粮食来住院，每天只缴五分钱的住院费。
    我不知道其他地方有没有这样的医院？但是“故县地区医院”确实是目前乡村里一座很出色的医院，它在各个方面都贯串着“多、快、好、省”的精神。
    勤俭起家，勤俭办医院
    “故县地区医院”是按照县里的指示，在原来卫生所的基础上建立起来的。那是1956年8月里的事。
    麻雀虽小五脏俱全，顶名叫个医院就得有医院的业务和设备。但是当时要钱没钱、要东西没东西。怎么办？只好自己动手干，他们的口号是“一人顶两人用，业务不耽误，腾出人手去劳动！”从此，自院长到大师傅人人动手挑水、和泥、担砖抬石、两个月功夫就把政府拨的一串破院建设好了，里面有手术室、针灸室、化验室，还有七间病房和隔离病房，另外在大街上还设立了一个门诊部和药房。
    这个医院全体工作人员只有十名，每个人都兼任别的职务。例如院长兼医生，医生兼会计，护士兼化验员，司药兼门诊挂号员和收费员，大师傅兼事务长，等等。他们人虽不多，任务可不轻。故县镇方圆八十里地内的疾病预防和治疗全归他们管。在这个范围里，总共包括八个乡、七十九个农业社、三百八十五个自然村里的八千一百十六户、二万四千八百十三口人。
    在五位专职或兼职的中、西医生里面，只有一位从正规医务学校——太原第一卫生学校毕业出来；其他四位不是过去边务农边行医，就是开药铺或在卫生所里见习出来的。他们共同的特点是：能适应农村环境、替病人着想，尽量采取最简便和最省钱的办法治病，因此普遍受到农民的欢迎和爱戴。
　　腿勤脚勤，医药下乡上山
    故县地区医院一成立，就确定自己的工作方针，叫作“预防为主”、叫作“腿勤脚勤、医药下乡上山。”一年多来，他们总共组织了八次巡回治疗，带着听诊器和药箱，走遍了一百五十多个小山庄和四处水利建设工地；在农忙时，医生和其他助理人员除值班的，都分头下乡上山，跟群众打成一片，有病治病，没病便一面参加生产一面宣传卫生常识。
    平时，不管白天黑夜、路途远近，只要有人来请，总是随叫随到的。今年1月间，在一个严寒的夜里，大家都躺下了，突然有人叫门，地区医院的医生们知道又有了急病，急急忙忙爬起来，青年医生马士良抢先一步，跟农民李小二赶到他家里去，这时发高烧的婴儿已经昏迷过去，马士良便用自制的“土氧气”给他输气，那婴儿慢慢地缓过来了，随后又作了些必要的诊治，婴儿就完全好了，现在，李小二夫妇见人常好说：“亏得腿勤脚勤的地区医院，我们孩子这条命才保住了！”
    从去年11月到今年2月短短三个月里，地区医院医生出诊达一百六十四次，平均每人出诊三十二次。甚至有些看来不是他们份内的事，只要知道了总是尽力去做的。不久前有位妇女从晋南回屯留县老家去，路过故县，孩子忽然发病，地区医院得到消息马上派人去急救，当时看来已经没有希望了，孩子全身抽搐、嘴唇发紫、眼珠往上翻，可是医生还尽一切努力拯救，注射退热剂又进行了针灸，终于使孩子慢慢平复过来了。
　　五分钱住一天的简易病房
    乡村里除了急病需要出诊外，还有许多病是要住医院治疗的。但是过去的医院规矩太多、花费太大，农民有了病宁愿在家里拖着，也不肯进医院。
    为了解决这个问题，故县地区医院修了七间“简易病房”。这些病房真是简易极了。七间里面有两间盘着两个炕，其余每间摆着两张木板床，合起来共有二十个床位。农民害病要住院，在门诊部挂个号
  （有保健关系的农业社社员免费，其他人收一角钱挂号费），就可以搬来了；遇上急病，就先进院再挂号。住院办法有两种：一是自带伙食，一是跟医院工作人员合伙吃饭，随病人自由挑选。采取第一种办法的，从家里带上铺盖卷和米面到医院里来，自己起火作饭，医院对病人的伙食不作特别要求，完全按照当地习惯和病情建议他们吃些容易消化的三和面、和子饭、擦圪斗、玉米粥等，每天花费跟家里差不多。此外每天缴五分钱的住院费，包括炕席、灯油（现在改成电灯）和诊治、护理等一切费用在内。重病号家里人也可随同住院护理，每人也只缴五分钱。
    离故县十五里的神头村，有个叫杨玉芳的青年姑娘害开放性肺结核，每天排痰量四、五百CC，什么都不能吃，干瘦得皮包骨，家里人都说不行了，地区医院医生张秀清去看，觉得还有一线希望，不过要住院治疗，她家里人都发愁开了，怕花不起钱，经过医生一再解释后搬去了。这个姑娘在医生和护士细心的治疗和护理下，病情逐渐好转，出院时患处已完全钙化了，人长得又白又胖，体重六十二公斤，除了链霉素等不多的药费外，伙食费跟在家里差不多。
    去年一年，“简易病房”总共接受一百八十三位病人，其中完全好的一百四十一位（占77.05％）、有好转的二十一位（占11.47％）、没有恶化的十四位（占7.65％）。病人的病是各色各样的。例如有一位叫许虎山的牧童，失足跌落崖下，把后脑皮碰破了，地区医院医生进行急救后，又作了缝合手术，不到半月就痊愈出院了。农民群众很满意，说：“想不到咱这山沟里的小医院，又能开肚子、又能补脑袋！”“住院自带米和面，治病针灸少花钱，简易病房太方便，真是咱农民好医院！”
　　乡村卫生医疗工作的中心
    故县地区医院出色的地方在于它不仅是个医院，而且是周围乡村卫生医疗工作的中心。
    在过去一年多的时间里，地区医院总共替八个乡、七十九个农业社训练了一百十八名保健员、一百二十二名接生员、三十七名针灸员、十三名预备医士；另外还帮助在乡的二十九名医生安排了工作，建立起卫生责任地段，在八次规模较大的巡回治疗和农忙下乡上山治疗的时候，都吸收了各地在乡医生参加。
    1957年5、6月间，地区医院还组织了六位医生，深入到南仁乡十一个农业社和一个中学校进行地方病调查，发现因为吃水缺碘患有不同程度甲状腺肿的社员七百七十五人（占社员总数19.60％）、学生一百五十五人（占学生总数48％），另外还发现小孩患克丁病（佝偻病）四十二人。地区医院便和故县供销社合作制成加碘食盐一百四十多斤，分发给甲状腺肿患者吃，经过三个疗程，已有半数病人有了好转。对于克丁病患者，地区医院派人到长治去弄了一部分骨粉和干甲状腺回来，分给他们吃用，也很见效。
    地区医院院长张留琐说，他们今年将要对另一种地方性疾病——小孩的黑热病开火。
