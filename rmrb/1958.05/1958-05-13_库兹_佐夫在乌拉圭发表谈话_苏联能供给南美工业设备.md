Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo: According to TASS, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov, who is visiting Uruguay, said at a press conference in Montevideo on the 10th that the Soviet people and government sincerely desire to strengthen mutual understanding and friendly cooperation with the Uruguayan people and the people of other countries around the world in order to safeguard and consolidate universal peace and security.

Regarding the argument that the Soviet Union has some kind of "special interest" in Latin American countries, Kuznetsov emphasized that the Soviet Union's only "interest" lies in strengthening peace and friendship between the Soviet people and the people of Latin American countries. In this spirit, the Soviet Union advocates establishing and developing normal relations with all Latin American countries and strengthening political, economic, and cultural ties with Uruguay.

Kuznetsov pointed out that the visit of the Uruguayan parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1956 promoted better mutual understanding between the Soviet and Uruguayan peoples. He believes that continuing to send delegations for mutual visits is in line with the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union is able to supply Latin American countries with industrial equipment and machinery necessary for industrialization, as well as various raw materials and commodities, and purchase Latin American export commodities.

Kuznetsov has already left Buenos Aires for Mexico on the same day.

　　库兹?佐夫在乌拉圭发表谈话
    苏联能供给南美工业设备
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚讯：在乌拉圭访问的苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫10日在蒙得维的亚举行的记者招待会上说，苏联人民和政府真诚地渴望同乌拉圭人民以及同世界上其他国家的人民加强相互了解和友好合作，来维护和巩固普遍和平和安全。
    库兹?佐夫就所谓苏联对拉丁美洲国家有某种“特别兴趣”的论调着重指出，苏联的唯一“兴趣”在于加强苏联人民和拉丁美洲国家人民之间的和平和友谊。本着这种精神，苏联主张同一切拉丁美洲的国家建立和发展正常关系，主张加强同乌拉圭的政治、经济和文化的联系。
    库兹?佐夫指出，1956年夏天乌拉圭议会代表团对苏联的访问，促进了苏联和乌拉圭人民更好的互相了解。他认为，继续互派代表团进行访问是符合两国经济贸易关系的发展的。苏联能够供给拉丁美洲各国工业化所必须的工业设备和机器以及各种原料商品，并购买拉丁美洲的出口商品。
    库兹?佐夫已经在同一天经布宜诺斯艾利斯前往墨西哥。
