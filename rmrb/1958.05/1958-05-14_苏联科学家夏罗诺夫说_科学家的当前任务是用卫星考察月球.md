Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: Soviet Professor Sharonov said in a recent article published in "Young Technician" that the most recent task for scientists is to launch artificial celestial bodies near the moon. These artificial celestial bodies, like the first two Soviet artificial satellites, will not return to Earth.

Sharonov said that as long as the satellite has a speed of ten kilometers per second, it can reach the moon. The current satellite speed has already reached eight kilometers per second.

Sharonov believes that the first stage is to conduct explorations near the moon. After the exploration period is over, the era of human conquest of the moon will arrive.

　　苏联科学家夏罗诺夫说
　　科学家的当前任务是用卫星考察月球
    据新华社莫斯科13日电 苏联夏罗诺夫教授在最近一期“少年技术家”发表文章说，科学家们最近的任务是把人造宇宙体发射到月球附近，这种人造宇宙体将像苏联头两个人造卫星一样，不回到地球上来。
    夏罗诺夫说，只要使卫星具有每秒十公里的速度，卫星就可到达月球。目前卫星速度已经达到每秒八公里。
    夏罗诺夫认为，第一个阶段是在月球附近进行考察。在考察时期结束以后，人类征服月球时期就到来了。
