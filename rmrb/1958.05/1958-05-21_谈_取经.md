    On "Seeking Sutras"
　　By Zeng Zhi
    A relatively good leader is not one who is good at sitting in the office thinking of solutions and ideas, but one who is good at concentrating and applying the wisdom and experience of the masses. This is what Chairman Mao said: being good at concentrating the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) (after research, transforming them into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then going to the masses to publicize and explain them, transforming them into the opinions of the masses, enabling the masses to persist in them, putting them into action, and testing in the actions of the masses whether these opinions are correct...
    To concentrate and apply the wisdom of the masses, one must step out of the office and go deep into the grassroots and among the masses. This leadership method, where leading cadres go deep into the grassroots and among the masses to discover good opinions and experiences among the masses, study and improve them, and then promote them among the masses, is the leadership method of "seeking sutras" that leading cadres of central state organs are now using when they go to the grassroots and among the masses.
    Although the Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly pointed out that "seeking sutras" from the grassroots and the masses is our "basic leadership method," and although many good leaders in the past have mastered this leadership method, the fact that "seeking sutras" from the grassroots and the masses has become such a widespread trend is a new phenomenon that emerged only after the rectification campaign eliminated bureaucracy.
    By "seeking sutras" from the grassroots and the masses, leading cadres can overcome the shortcomings of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality in the past, enabling leading cadres to hear and see some situations and problems that could not be understood by sitting in the office; it can also eliminate the estrangement between superiors and subordinates, leaders and the masses, and greatly strengthen the connection between superiors and subordinates, leaders and the masses.
    The main benefit lies in "seeking sutras." The wisdom of the masses is infinite, and the masses contain countless good opinions and experiences. By concentrating these things, studying and improving them, and then promoting them to more of the masses, we can greatly promote our various tasks and accelerate their development. Not only that, but "seeking sutras" from the grassroots and the masses can also enrich leadership thought and improve leadership skills. Some things that leading cadres could not have thought of sitting in the office, the masses not only thought of, but also achieved; some problems that were originally considered difficult to solve, the masses not only found ways to solve, but also solved very well. For leading cadres to go down and discover and concentrate these good opinions, good methods, and good experiences of the masses is an improvement of their own leadership level and a liberation of their own leadership thinking. The leading cadres of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have a relatively deep understanding of this point. In the metallurgical industry, some people have always believed that the iron content of iron ore concentrate powder reaching 61% and the metal recovery rate reaching 80% to 81% could not be improved any further, because the contradiction between improving the iron content of iron ore concentrate powder and improving the metal recovery rate could not be resolved technically. However, at the on-site meeting held in Benxi this time, the Nanfen Concentrator resolved this contradiction and provided the experience of achieving an iron content of 65% in concentrate powder and a metal recovery rate of 90%. The experience of the Nanfen Concentrator liberated leadership thinking and enriched the leadership itself, and the leading cadres of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry can use the experience of Nanfen to vigorously promote the improvement of work in other concentrators. The Second Ministry of Commerce's finding of its own direction of work from summarizing the experience of using wild fibers and waste product utilization in Santai County, Sichuan and Wuji County, Hebei, is also a good example. Such examples can be found in many organs where leading cadres have already gone deep to "seek sutras."
    All these examples show that "seeking sutras" from the grassroots and the masses is a good leadership method and deserves to be greatly promoted.

    谈“取经”
　　曾志
    一个比较好的领导者，不在于他善于坐在办公室里想办法、出主意，而在于他善于集中和运用群众的智慧、经验。也就是毛主席所说的：善于将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确……。
    要集中和运用群众的智慧，就必须走出办公室深入到基层到群众中去。而这种领导干部深入基层、深入群众去发现群众中好的意见、好的经验，加以研究、提高，然后在群众中加以推广的做法，就是现在中央国家机关领导干部到基层到群众中去“取经”的领导方法。
    到基层到群众中去“取经”这个走群众路线的领导方法，虽然党和毛主席早就一再指出过是我们“基本的领导方法”，过去，也有不少好的领导者掌握了这个领导方法，但是，到基层到群众中去“取经”能够成为这样普遍的风气，却还是经过整风打掉了官气以后才出现的新气象。
    到基层、到群众中去“取经”，领导干部就可以克服过去脱离群众、脱离实际的缺点，使领导干部听到、看到一些过去坐机关所无法了解到的情况和问题；还可以消除上级和下级、领导和群众之间的隔阂，大大加强上级和下级、领导和群众之间的联系。
    好处主要在于“取经”。群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，群众中蕴藏着不知多少好的意见、好的经验，把这些东西集中起来，加以研究、提高，再推广到更多的群众中去，就可以大大推动我们的各项工作，促使它们加速地发展。不但如此，到基层到群众中去“取经”，还可以丰富领导思想，提高领导水平。有些本来领导干部坐在办公室里想不到的事，群众不但想到了，而且做到了；本来认为难以解决的问题，群众不但设法解决了，而且解决得很好。领导干部下去发现、集中群众中的这些好意见、好办法、好经验，对自己的领导水平就是一次提高，对自己的领导思想也是一次解放。这一点，冶金部的领导干部就有比较深刻的体会。在冶金工业中，过去有人一直认为铁矿精选粉含铁量达到61％，金属回收率达到80％到81％，就不能再提高了，因为在技术上提高铁矿精选粉含铁量和提高金属回收率的矛盾解决不了。但是，这次在本溪召开的现场会议上，南芬选矿厂就解决了这个矛盾，提供了精选粉含铁量达到65％和金属回收率达到90％的经验。南芬选矿厂这个经验，就解放了领导思想，充实了领导本身，冶金部的领导干部就可以用南芬的经验，有力地推动其他选矿厂改进工作。第二商业部从总结四川三台县和河北无极县利用野生纤维和废品利用的经验中，找出了自己的工作方向，也是一个好例子。这样的例子，在领导干部已经深入下去取过“经”的机关，还可以找到很多。
    这些例子都说明，到基层到群众中去“取经”是个好的领导方法，值得大大提倡。
