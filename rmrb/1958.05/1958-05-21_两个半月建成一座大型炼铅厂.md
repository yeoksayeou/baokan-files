    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 20th - The city of Gejiu, Yunnan Province, has built a large lead smelting plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons of crude lead in two and a half months, with a total investment of only 500,000 yuan.
    From the time the Gejiu Lead Smelting Plant was determined to be built, the Gejiu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that it was necessary to proceed from the specific situation and boldly break through all outdated regulations. Lead smelting must first go through a "sintering" process. According to the "standard" design, a sintering machine should be used, but the sintering machine had to be ordered from abroad. They then designed six sintering furnaces to replace the sintering machine, which saved money and guaranteed time. In the design process, they eliminated all formalism and cumbersome procedures. After some issues of principle were determined, the engineers, technicians, and veteran workers took care of the rest themselves. During construction, both parties worked together. The engineering designers were responsible from design and construction to putting the plant into production. In this way, any problems that occurred during construction could be resolved quickly.

    两个半月建成一座大型炼铅厂
    据新华社昆明20日电  云南省个旧市用两个半月的时间建成了一座年产粗铅万吨的大型炼铅厂，全部投资仅五十万元。
    个旧炼铅厂从确定办厂的时候起，中共个旧市委就强调要从具体情况出发，大胆冲破一切陈旧的规章。炼铅必须先经“烧结”过程，按“标准”设计是用烧结机，可是烧结机要到国外定货。他们就设计了六个烧结炉来代替烧结机，既省钱又保证了时间。在设计过程中，他们取消了一切形式主义的烦琐手续，一些原则性的问题确定下来以后，就由工程师、技术员和老工人自己搞去。在施工中，甲方、乙方大家一起干。工程设计人员从设计、施工直到投入生产，一直管到底。这样，施工中发生什么问题，就可以很快地得到解决。
