    The Flower and Fruit of the Fig
    Jia Qi
    Many people think that the fig bears fruit without flowering, so they call it the "unflower fruit" (无花果, literally "flowerless fruit"). In fact, it must first flower before it can bear fruit. The fig's appearance looks like a normal fruit, but from a botanical point of view, it is not a true fruit, but mostly formed by the enlargement of the "receptacle." Its true flowers all grow inside the "receptacle," that is, inside the fruit. If we cut a fig in half, we can see countless small protrusions inside, and these are its flowers. These flowers are very small and can only be seen clearly with a magnifying glass. Among them are female flowers and male flowers. Each female flower can also bear a very small fruit. These very small fruits are also contained within the large receptacle. What we eat is mainly the receptacle, not the true fruit.
    Figs also need insects to pollinate, but the insect that pollinates figs is a very small wasp, usually invisible to the naked eye. Some varieties of figs often have poor fruit set if they are not pollinated by these small wasps.
    Figs all grow from the leaf axils. Those that grow early mature in summer, and those that grow late mature in autumn. When it matures, the small opening at the top of the fig gradually opens, and the surrounding skin also cracks. At this time, it can be picked and eaten raw, which has a special flavor. It would be even sweeter if white sugar is added. In addition to being eaten raw, it can also be processed into candied fruit and dried fruit, and it can also be made into canned food.
    The fig is a deciduous shrub or small tree of the mulberry family, and can grow to more than ten feet tall. It originated in the Mediterranean coast of Europe and has a long history of cultivation. It has been cultivated in Egypt for thousands of years. It was introduced to China before the Tang Dynasty, and it has been more than a thousand years now. At present, all countries cultivate it, and it is suitable for cultivation in the Jiangnan area of China. The north is cold, so most are cultivated in pots, and must be moved indoors in winter.

    无花果的花与果
    加其
    不少人认为无花果是不开花就结果的，所以叫它是无花果。其实它还是要先开花而后才结果。无花果的外形看起来像一般水果一样，但是从植物学来看，它不是真正的果实，而大部分是由“花托”膨大而成的。它的真正的花都长在“花托”里面，也就是在果子里面。若是我们把一个无花果从中间切开，就可以看出来在里面有无数的小凸起，这就是它的花。这些花很小，须用放大镜才能看得清楚，其中有雌花有雄花。每一个雌花还能结成一个很小的果实。这很小的果实也同样包藏在大的花托里面。我们吃的主要是花托，不是真正的果实。
    无花果也需要昆虫来传粉，不过这种给无花果传粉的是一种极小的蜂子，通常用眼睛看不出来。有一些无花果的品种，若没有这些小的蜂子给它传粉的时候，往往结实不良。
    无花果都从叶腋里生出来，生出早的在夏天成熟，晚的在秋天成熟。当成熟的时候，在无花果上端原有的小口就渐渐张开，四周的皮也随着裂开。这时候就可以采下来生吃，有一种特别的风味。若将白糖夹进去吃，那就更甜了。除了生吃外，还可以加工制成蜜饯和干果，也可以制成罐头。
    无花果是桑科的一种落叶灌木或小乔木，高者可达一丈多高。它原产在欧洲地中海沿岸，栽培历史很久了，埃及栽培已有数千年，我国在唐朝以前就已传入，到现在也有一千多年了。目前各国都有栽培，在我国适宜在江南地区培植。北方天寒，大多用盆栽培，在冬季必须移到室内去。
