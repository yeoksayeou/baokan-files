Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th. Elementary education has been universalized in the revolutionary old base area of Jiangxi Province, with 98.9% of school-age children attending elementary school. At the same time, the province has basically achieved the goal of having a people-run middle school in every township, and literacy classes and night schools have been established everywhere, enabling most young and middle-aged illiterates to participate in cultural learning.

Now, this revolutionary old base area, where mountainous areas account for 60% of the province's total area, is experiencing a situation where "everyone is learning culture and there is the sound of reading everywhere."

Simultaneous to the great leap forward in agricultural production, Jiangxi Province launched a movement involving the entire Party, the entire people running schools, and the entire people eliminating illiteracy. Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead, educational departments worked hard, closely integrated with production, and adopted the method of simultaneous propaganda, planning, enrollment, schooling, classes, and solving specific problems to organize the masses to run schools and eliminate illiteracy, achieving great results. Under the leadership of the First Secretary of the Ruijin County Party Committee, the red capital of Ruijin County drew on the experience of diligently running Lenin Elementary Schools in the past and universalized elementary education in five days. Immediately afterward, it quickly established eighty-eight agricultural middle schools. Shi Yuqian, the First Secretary of the Yichun County Party Committee, went deep into primary and secondary schools and literacy classes of the people-run schools to understand the situation and lead the masses in running schools and eliminating illiteracy. Now, this county has established illiteracy elimination associations in every township, illiteracy elimination sub-associations in every commune, and illiteracy elimination leading groups in every team, with dedicated personnel responsible at every level. As a result, the county has universalized primary and secondary education and all young and middle-aged people have entered literacy classes to learn in a short period of time. Xingguo, Suichuan, Ninggang, Yongxin, Lianhua, Yiyang, Hengfeng and other old revolutionary base areas, which were culturally backward in the past, now have middle schools in every township and primary schools in every commune and village. In order to accelerate the progress of the illiteracy elimination movement, Jiangxi Province has fully mobilized literate people to participate in illiteracy elimination teaching work. After Anyuan County mobilized more than 20,000 literate people to participate in illiteracy elimination teaching work, the pace of the illiteracy elimination movement was greatly accelerated.

Jiangxi Province now has 19,090 newly established people-run primary schools, with 542,455 students. Together with the students in the original public and people-run primary schools, the province has a total of 2,392,556 primary school students. In addition, 3,319 new people-run agricultural middle schools and other vocational middle schools have been established, with nearly 100,000 students; a number of spare-time middle and primary schools have also been developed.

At present, Jiangxi is taking measures to consolidate the newly established people-run primary and secondary schools and night school literacy classes.

　　江西普及小学教育
　　大部分青壮年文盲参加了文化学习
    新华社南昌19日电　革命老根据地江西省已经普及小学教育，占98.9％的学龄儿童都已进了小学。同时，全省已经基本上实现乡乡有民办中学，并且到处办起了识字班、夜校，使大部分的青壮年文盲参加了文化学习。
    现在这个山区面积占全省总面积60％的革命老根据地，已经是“人人学文化，处处读书声”了。
    在农业生产大跃进的同时，江西省掀起了全党动手、全民办学和全民扫除文盲的运动。各地党委书记挂帅，教育部门鼓起干劲，紧密结合生产，采取边宣传、边规划、边招生、边入学、边上课、边解决具体问题的突击方法，组织群众办学和扫盲，取得了很大成绩。红色故都瑞金县在中共县委第一书记的领导下，吸取了过去勤俭办列宁小学的经验，在五天内就普及了小学；紧接着又迅速办起了八十八所农业中学。中共宜春县委第一书记史玉谦深入中、小学和民校识字班了解情况，领导群众办学和扫盲。现在这个县已经乡乡成立了扫盲协会，社社成立了扫盲分会，队队有扫盲领导小组，层层有专人负责，因而在短时期内全县便普及了中小学教育，全部青壮年都进了识字班学习。兴国、遂川、宁冈、永新、莲花、弋阳、横峰等革命老根据地县，过去文化落后，现在也已经是乡乡有中学，社社、村村有小学。为了加速扫盲运动的进展，江西省曾全面发动识字的人参加扫盲教学工作。安远县发动两万多名识字的人参加扫盲教学工作以后，大大加快了扫盲运动的进展速度。
    江西全省现在已有一万九千零九十所新办的民办小学，学生达五十四万二千四百五十五人。加上原有公立小学和民办小学的学生，全省已有小学生二百三十九万二千五百五十六人。另外，新办了民办农业中学和其他职业中学三千三百一十九所，学生近十万人；还发展了一批业余中、小学。
    目前，江西各地正在采取措施巩固新办的民办中小学和夜校识字班。
