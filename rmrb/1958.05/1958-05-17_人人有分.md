Everyone Gets a Share (Pamphlet Poem)
　　Zheng Chengyi, Shanghai Dafeng No. 2 Factory

    Technical innovation,
    Everyone gets a share,
    The Great Leap Forward hasn't reached its peak,
    We still need to use our brains.
    As long as you dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do,
    And discuss it more with everyone;
    Creation and invention are not difficult,
    It's truly the majority who rule.

    人人有分（传单诗）
    上海达丰二厂　郑成义
    技术革新，
    人人有分，
    跃进没有到顶，
    还要大动脑筋。
    只要敢想、敢说、敢做，
    加上大家多商量；
    创造发明并不难，
    实在人多为王。
