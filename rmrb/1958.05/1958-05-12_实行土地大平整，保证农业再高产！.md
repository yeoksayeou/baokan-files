Implement Large-Scale Land Leveling to Ensure Further Increases in Agricultural Production!
	Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Guangdong Province

	Since the realization of cooperativization, agricultural production in the Shantou Special Zone has achieved comprehensive increases in production year after year, and the average per-mu yield of grain has exceeded 800 jin. The task before us now is not only to maintain the existing output without decline, nor can we be satisfied with an increase of only thirty or fifty jin per mu per year. Instead, we must strive for continuous leaps forward on the basis of high yields, aiming to become a thousand-jin special zone this year, and a fifteen-hundred-jin special zone in about three years, to meet the requirements of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.

	To achieve this goal, we need to explore a new path to achieve even higher yields. Land leveling is one of the crucial new measures. Although our region has improved the soil on some cultivated land in the past few years and correspondingly increased yields, it has not completely changed the land conditions of small-scale farming that have been historically left behind. Therefore, it cannot yet meet the needs of large-scale rotation of dry and wet crops, the adoption of higher cultivation techniques, and the realization of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, which are precisely the necessary paths for our region's future agricultural production to achieve even higher yields. At present, there are more than ten types of low-yield fields in the entire region's cultivated land that urgently need improvement, such as clay fields, shallow grid fields, sandy fields, mountain pit fields, cold bottom fields, lake and ocean fields, anti-acid fields, saline-alkali fields (sandy fields), and sandy dry land. Moreover, many cultivated lands are uneven, the fields are fragmented, the irrigation and drainage are poor, and the roads are narrow and winding; especially the competition for land between the living and the dead, with tombs standing everywhere, many graves and barren tombs occupy large areas of cultivated land (some occupying more than 10%), dividing the cultivated land into fragments, which seriously hinders the great leap forward in agricultural production and urgently needs to be reorganized. Therefore, last winter and this spring, while fiercely attacking the water conservancy barrier and the fertilizer barrier, our region also launched a large-scale land leveling movement to transform nature and change customs, from the plains to the hills, from the coast to the mountains. After more than two months of intensive struggle, by the time of spring plowing, more than 3,486,500 mu of soil had been leveled and improved, completely changing the face of more than half of the region's land. Farmers in Jieyang County said, "People take the socialist road, and the fields must also become socialist fields to look like socialism!" This reflects the masses' views and evaluations of the land leveling movement.

	Implementing large-scale land leveling and thoroughly changing the backward state of cultivated land is not only a serious struggle to transform nature, but also an ideological revolution to break down feng shui geography and feudal superstition. Therefore, ideological struggles between materialism and idealism, advanced and backward, promoting and hindering, have been carried out from beginning to end among Party members and Youth League members, cadres and the masses. Should we do it or not? Should we do it on a small scale or a large scale? Are there ghosts or not? Should we preserve the "sacred and inviolable" ancestral tombs and let the living obey the dead, or should we resolutely relocate them and let the dead obey the living? Everyone's views were very inconsistent. But one point was completely consistent, and that was the demand for rapid increase in production. This is the most common and large amount of opinion, and the most essential thing in the masses' opinions. Under the correct leadership and encouragement of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, the Party organizations in the Shantou region grasped the essence of this issue, educated and guided the masses from a positive perspective, criticized various erroneous ideas, and organized it into a conscious action of millions of people. The movement adopted the method of secretaries taking action, mobilizing the whole people, cadres taking the lead, focusing on demonstrations, breaking through one point, organizing visits, and conducting simultaneous discussions, planning, and actions, with comprehensive blossoming. In the plains area, the experience of the Guanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Shanghua Township, Chenghai County, was universally promoted, adopting comprehensive measures such as leveling the plains and filling the depressions, moving graves up the mountains, expanding cultivated land; cutting high and filling low, leveling the cultivated land; applying miscellaneous fertilizers according to different soil types, conducting soil improvement, adding mud, and adding sand; repairing canals and digging ditches, rectifying irrigation and drainage; straightening and rectifying roads; modifying field ridges, merging large plots of land, and rationally dividing cultivated areas, so that dry gardens became paddy fields, wasteland became plains, and waste land became fertile land. In the hilly areas and mountainous areas, the experience of the Qipan Agricultural Cooperative in Yunlu Township, Jieyang County, was universally promoted, adopting methods of digging Wangtian Ponds, Houkan ditches, and field-side water storage ponds, raising field ridges, and building gully dams, storing water everywhere, combining diversion and storage, rectifying irrigation and drainage systems, doing a good job in soil and water conservation, and realizing the water conservancy of dry gardens and slopes; leveling high and filling low in cultivated land, migrating graves, deepening soil layers, conducting soil improvement, applying miscellaneous fertilizers; and combining with the rectification of roads, comprehensively rectifying cultivated land, and fully exploiting the production potential of land in hilly areas. Each county, township, and cooperative, proceeding from the requirements of further developing agricultural production and preparing for agricultural mechanization, conducted comprehensive planning according to the cultivated land conditions of different regions, adopted the principles of comprehensive rectification, centralized rectification, perennial rectification, and gradual improvement, so that land leveling became a regular mass movement, and it was necessary to continuously improve land conditions to meet the needs of continuous leaps forward in agricultural production.

	Because the large-scale land leveling is a basic measure for our region to achieve even higher yields, reflecting the urgent demand of the masses to further develop agricultural production, the experience of Guanshan Cooperative and Qipan Cooperative blossomed everywhere in the whole region once it was promoted. In the vast rural areas, enthusiastic crowds could be seen everywhere, with flags and decorations, gongs and drums, holding solemn and grand oath-taking meetings to change nature and change customs. In this labor army, there were not only young people, old people, children, teachers, students, urban residents, and local troops, but even overseas Chinese dependents and rural women who had never dared to touch coffins and dead people's bones were involved in the movement and personally moved graves. The movement often maintained 800,000 people, who seized sunny days and cloudy days, eating in the fields, living in the fields, working in the fields, working day and night to attack the work, determined to level the cultivated land before transplanting rice seedlings. Therefore, the movement was like a broken bamboo, swift and abnormal. Every night, the Chaoshan Plain was lit up with lights, like daytime. In many places, what were still uneven, scattered graves and barren tombs in the morning became a flat and fertile field in the evening. In the short period of more than two months, more than 1 million graves were leveled; more than 2 million sets of bones were moved up the mountains, and most of them "joined the cooperative" (built public cemeteries); 1.4 million rats and 160,000 snakes hidden in the barren graves were eliminated; 600,000 curved old field ridges were removed; more than 18,000 waste pits and countless barren ditches were filled; large pieces of wasteland turned into fertile land; and uneven, small and fragmented cultivated land became a large, neat and flat piece. This made it better to turn large areas of dry land into paddy fields and carry out large-scale dry-wet rotation, and fully realize the basis for three or even four crops a year; after the irrigation and drainage system was rectified, the conditions for implementing large-scale scientific water use became more favorable; the cultivated land was expanded (a total of more than 71,000 mu was expanded); the cultivation and three-guarantee management were greatly facilitated; the flat cultivated land and wide and straight roads were more suitable for mechanization. In a word, the preliminary results of land leveling and soil improvement have greatly improved the productivity of agricultural cooperatives, and the great leap forward in agricultural production is more guaranteed. The members of Liaoyuan Township in Puning County saw a large area of flat cultivated land after leveling, and praised that only socialism can produce "socialist fields", and compared the present with the past, singing such songs:

	Remembering the past: Field ridges are uphill and downhill,
		Tombs are stacked like sesame cakes;
		Plowing the field is less than digging the corners,
		Triangles and six ears are like Guan Dao.

	Looking at today: The road is straight and newly built,
		Ditches are flowing with water;
		The fields are connected in pieces,
		Magpies are singing for a good harvest.

	Land leveling has far more than a significant role in developing agricultural production. At the same time, it has also enabled the Party to obtain immeasurable and huge ideological gains. Among the peasants, a new moral and ethical concept has rapidly grown up. Many peasants have recognized that agricultural cooperatives are "good feng shui" and "good geography". Only by relying on agricultural cooperatives and relying on their own hard work to build socialism well can they improve their material and cultural living standards. Once some members looked at the levelled field with a sigh which indicates that the private thoughts in the minds of farmers, just like the small patches of land that are starting to be levelled. The feudal superstition ideas among the masses in the Chaoshan area were originally very deep, and the feudal clan disputes were more prominent than in other areas of the province. After the land leveling movement, the masses' thoughts were greatly liberated, and the deep-rooted feng shui geography concept of thousands of years was also violently impacted. More and more people believed in atheism. Many old and backward customs were abandoned. In the past, there was an old concept popular among the peasants to choose a good feng shui for ancestors, parents, and themselves to protect future generations. Now it is replaced by the new concept of "suffering a little today in exchange for the happiness of future generations." The long-standing grievances accumulated by some backward farmers in history due to superstitious feng shui were resolved more thoroughly this time. The ancestral tombs that were considered sacred and inviolable for thousands of years were removed by the masses themselves. In many places, the ancestral tablets, together with the statues of Chenghuangye, Leishenye, Fudelaoye, Tianhou Niangniang ... were swept away. Once people's minds are liberated, they immediately receive practical benefits. The original waste of many properties for the dead and for gods and ghosts has now become another arrangement for the dead according to the living and the production needs of agricultural cooperatives. The wasteland of tombs has become a good raw material for improving the soil, and a large number of stone materials, ash shells, and coffin boards and other waste materials in the tombs have become good materials for agricultural cooperatives to carry out water conservancy construction and build pig houses, toilets, build cars, build boats, make manure buckets, make melon racks, and make small water gates on the fields (Guanshan Cooperative in Chenghai County can save 50,000 yuan for waste utilization by leveling tombs alone), and the gold (242 taels), silver (1,222 taels), and jade (3,898 pieces) in the tombs have become the production funds of agricultural cooperatives; the temples that used to be filled with many idols have now become pig houses or processing plants of agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives have saved a large amount of expenditure here. At the same time, a large amount of superstitious goods wasted for worshiping gods and ancestors have also been greatly saved (Raoping County reduced the waste of superstitious goods by 85,000 yuan around the Spring Festival this year), and the members of agricultural cooperatives have also saved an expense here. At the same time, since the land leveling fully demonstrated the superiority of cooperativization, the fact that individual farmers could not do things in the past can be done by cooperatives in a very short period of time, and agricultural production has developed rapidly. This fact has also educated a small number of wealthy middle peasants who still have wavering emotions about the road of cooperativization, strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road, and urged a small number of individual farmers who are still outside the cooperatives to apply to join the cooperatives. For example, in Caitang Township, Chao'an County, 147 individual farmers joined the cooperatives during the land leveling. The wealthy middle peasant Huang Zhizhi persisted in individual farming for three years, and also joined the cooperative in this land leveling. In the production practice of land leveling, people not only changed the backward appearance of the land, but also changed the backward appearance of their own thoughts. All cadres have experienced a sharp ideological struggle and improved their socialist consciousness. All these great achievements in ideological revolution have been transformed into material power, promoting the development of production.

	Our region has achieved preliminary results in the first battle of the land leveling movement before spring plowing, but the problem has not been completely solved. The second battle of the movement will be launched soon. We are preparing to organize the third battle after summer planting and before autumn harvest, and organize a surprise sweep this winter to strive to comprehensively rectify all 6.6 million mu of cultivated land in the region this year, to ensure that agricultural production is high-yielding and leaping forward!

　　实行土地大平整，保证农业再高产！
　　中共广东省汕头地委第一书记　罗天
    汕头专区的农业生产，在实现合作化以来，连年获得全面增产，粮食平均亩产量已超过八百斤。现在摆在我们面前的任务，既不是保住现有产量不下降，也不能满足于一年一亩增产三几十斤，而必须在高产的基础上，连续跃进，争取在今年成为千斤专区，三年左右成为一千五百斤专区，以适应多快好省地建设社会主义的要求。
    为了达到这个目的，需要摸索一条获得再高产的新途径，平整土地，就是其中一项关系重大的新措施。几年以来，我区虽曾在部分耕地上进行了改良土壤，相应地提高了产量，但是还没有彻底改变历史上遗留下来的小农经营的土地状况，因而还不能适应大规模的水旱轮作、采用更高的耕作技术与实现农业机械化半机械化的需要，而这些恰恰是我区今后农业再高产的必由之途。目前全区的耕地，不但存在着粘土田、浅格田、沙质田、山坑田、冷底田、湖洋田、反酸田、咸渍田（沙田）、沙旱地等十多种低产田急需改良；而且不少耕地高低不平，田丘零碎，排灌不良，道路细小弯曲；特别是死人与活人争地，到处坟堆林立，很多坟墓、荒冢占用了大片耕地（多的占地10％以上），将耕地分割得支离破碎，严重地障碍着农业生产的大跃进，急需整理。因此，去冬今春，我区在猛攻水利关、肥料关的同时，还从平原到丘陵、从沿海到山区，开展了一个改造自然、移风易俗的土地大平整运动。经过两个多月的紧张奋战，到春耕前为止，已经平整和改良土壤达三百四十八万六千五百多亩，使全区一半以上的土地面貌完全改观。揭阳县的农民说：“人走社会主义路，田也要变成社会主义田，才像个社会主义样！”反映了群众对平整土地运动的看法和评价。
    实行土地大平整，彻底改变耕地的落后状态，不只是一场改造自然的严重斗争，同时又是一个破除风水地理、封建迷信的思想革命。因此，在党员与团员、干部与群众中，自始至终展开着唯物与唯心、先进与落后、促进与促退的思想斗争。要搞还是不搞小？搞还是大搞？有鬼还是没有鬼？保留住“神圣不可侵犯”的祖宗坟墓，让活人服从死人，还是坚决予以迁移，让死人服从活人？大家的看法很不一致。但是有一点是完全一致的，那就是迅速增产的要求。这是最普遍大量的意见，是群众意见中最本质的东西。汕头地区党的组织在广东省委的正确领导与鼓舞下，抓住了这一问题的本质，从积极方面教育引导群众，批判各种错误思想，把它组织成千百万群众自觉的行动。运动采取书记动手，全民动员，干部带头，重点示范，突破一点，组织参观的办法，边鸣放、边辩论、边规划、边行动，全面开花。在平原地区，普遍推广澄海县上华乡冠山农业社的经验，采用平埔填堀，移坟上山，扩大耕地；削高填低，整平耕地；分别不同土质，增施杂肥，进行客土、入泥、加沙，改良土壤；修渠挖沟，整顿排灌；裁弯取直，整理道路；修改田埂，并大田块，合理划分耕作区等综合措施，使旱园变水田，埔堆变平原，废地变良田。在丘陵地区与山区，则普遍推广揭阳县云路乡棋盘农业社的经验，采用挖望天池、后坎沟、田头积水池，培高田埂，建筑谷坊的办法，处处蓄水，引蓄结合，整理排灌系统，做好水土保持，实现旱园坡地水利化；在耕地上平高填低，迁移坟墓，翻深土层，进行客土，增施杂肥，改良土壤；并结合整理道路，综合整理耕 地，充分发挥丘陵地区土地的生产潜力。各县、乡、社，都从进一步发展农业生产，为农业机械化做好准备的要求出发，根据不同地区的耕地条件，进行全面规划，采取综合整理、集中整理、常年整理、逐步提高的方针，使平整土地成为经常的群众性的运动，务必要使土地条件不断改善，以适应农业生产不断跃进的需要。
    由于土地大平整是我区取得再高产的一项基本措施，反映了群众进一步发展农业生产的迫切要求，因此，冠山社、棋盘社的经验一经推广，即在全区处处开花。在广大的农村里，到处都可以看到热情洋溢的人群，张旗结彩，敲锣打鼓，举行着庄严隆重的改变自然移风易俗的誓师大会。在这支劳动大军里，不仅有青年、有老人、有小孩、有教师、有学生、有城镇居民、有当地驻军，而且连从来不敢碰一碰棺材和死人骨头的侨眷和农村妇女都卷入运动，亲自动手迁坟了。运动经常保持八十万人，他们抓晴天，抓阴天，吃在田间，住在田间，工作在田间，夜以继日地突击工作，决心在插秧前整好耕地。因此，运动势如破竹，迅猛异常。每至夜间，潮汕平原一片灯火，如同白昼。很多地方早上还是高低不平、星罗棋布的坟埔荒冢，晚上就变成一片平坦的良田。在短短的两个多月中，有一百多万座坟墓被平掉；二百多万付的骸骨被迁移上山，并且多数“入了社”（搞公墓）；隐藏在荒坟中的一百四十万只老鼠和十六万条蛇被消灭了；六十万条弯曲的旧田埂被铲掉；一万八千多个废堀和无数的荒沟被填平；大块荒埔变成良田；高低不平、细小零碎的耕地连成齐整平坦的一大片。这样就使得大片旱地变成水田，进行大规模的水旱轮作，全面实现一年三熟甚至四熟的基础更好了；排灌系统经过整顿后，实行大面积科学用水的条件更加有利了；耕地扩大了（共扩大七万一千多亩）；耕作和三包管理大为方便了；平坦的耕地和宽阔笔直的道路，更适合于机械化的需要了。一句话，平整土地和改良土壤的初步结果，使农业社的生产力大大提高了，农业生产大跃进更加有保证了。普宁县燎原乡的社员看到了平整后的一大片平坦耕地，都称道只有社会主义才能出“社会主义田”，并以今比昔，唱出了这样的歌：
    忆昔日：田塍上坡接下坡，
            坟堆叠叠似饼桃；
            犁田少过掘田角，
            三角六耳像关刀。
    看今朝：大路直直是新修，
            沟渠条条水长流；
            田园块块连成片，
            喜鹊声声兆丰收。
    平整土地远不止在发展农业生产上具有重大的作用，它同时还使党获得了难以估量的巨大的思想丰收。在农民中，一种新的道德伦理观念迅速地成长起来了。很多农民已认定农业社就是“好风水”、“好地理”，只有依靠农业社，依靠自己的辛勤劳动把社会主义建设好，才能提高自己的物质生活和文化生活水平。曾经有个别社员望着被平毁的田基深深地叹了一口气，这一声叹息具有重大的意义，它表明农民头脑中的私有观念也像小块土地上的田基一样开始平毁了。潮汕地区群众中的封建迷信观念原来是很深厚的，封建宗派纠纷也比省内其他地区突出。经过土地大平整运动，群众的思想得到很大解放，几千年来根深蒂固的风水地理观念同样受到猛烈的冲击，相信无神论的人越来越多了。许多旧的落后的风俗习惯被废弃了。以前在农民中流行着为祖宗、为父母、为自己选择一座好风水来荫庇后代的旧观念，现在被“今天吃点苦，换来子孙万年福”的新观念所代替了。历史上部分落后农民因为迷信风水发生纠纷积存下来的宿怨，这一次比较彻底地解决了。千百年来认为神圣不可侵犯的祖宗坟墓被群众亲自动手移掉了，不少地方的家神牌，连同城隍爷、雷神爷、福德老爷、天后娘娘……的神像一起扫光了。人们的思想一经解放，就立即收到实际效益。原来活人为死人、为神鬼浪费许多财物，现在已变成死人根据活人和农业社的生产需要而另作安排了。坟墓的埔土变为改良土壤的好原料，坟墓中大量的石料、灰壳和棺材板等废物变成农业社进行水利建设和建筑猪舍、厕所、造车、造船、造粪桶、做瓜架、做田头小水闸的好材料了（澄海县冠山社单平坟废物利用一项即可节约五万元），坟墓中的黄金（二百四十二两）、银子（一千二百二十二两）、玉器（三千八百九十八件），变为农业社的生产资金了；以前装着许多神像的庙宇，现在变为农业社的猪舍或加工厂了，农业社从这里节约了一大笔开支。还有为拜神祭祖所浪费的大量迷信品亦大大地节省了（饶平县今年春节前后即减少迷信品的浪费达八万五千元），农业社的社员也从这里节约了一笔开支。同时，由于平整土地中充分地显示了合作化的优越性，过去个体农民办不到的事情，合作社在很短的时间就能够办得到，并迅速发展了农业生产，这一事实，亦教育了对走合作化道路仍然存有动摇情绪的少数富裕中农，坚定了他们走社会主义道路的信心，促使少数还在社外的单干农民申请入社，如潮安县彩塘乡在平整土地中即有一百四十七户单干农民入了社，富裕中农黄治枝坚持了三年单干，在这次平整土地中也入社了。人们在平整土地的生产实践中，不仅改变了土地的落后面貌，而且也改变了自己思想的落后面貌。全体干部都经历了一场尖锐的思想斗争，提高了社会主义觉悟。所有这一切思想革命中的巨大成果又转化为物质力量，推动着生产的发展。
    我区在春耕前土地大平整运动的第一个战役中已取得初步成绩，但还没有彻底解决问题。运动的第二个战役即将在最近展开。我们准备在夏种后秋收前再组织第三个战役，并在今冬组织一次突击扫尾，争取在今年内把全区六百六十万亩耕地都进行一次综合整理，以保证农业高产再高产，跃进再跃进！
