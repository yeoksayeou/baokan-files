　　New Summer, New Style
    One day, the Wuhan Sports, Stationery, and Instruments Wholesale and Retail Store received a customer named Zheng Jiasheng. He was a worker at the Yellow River Survey and Design Institute and had come to Wuhan from Kaifeng on business. Zheng Jiasheng saw a Qinqin (a Chinese plucked string instrument) in the store's musical instrument cabinet, playing with it for a long time, unable to put it down. The salesperson, Li Wenguang, found it strange that he seemed to want to buy it but didn't, so he sincerely asked him if there were any difficulties. Zheng Jiasheng said that he had been looking for a long time in Kaifeng but had not been able to buy such a beloved Qinqin. Now that he had finally found it, he didn't have enough money with him. Upon hearing this, Li Wenguang immediately offered to lend him the money to help him fulfill his wish. Zheng Jiasheng declined repeatedly, but finally accepted Li Wenguang's kindness and wrote down Li Wenguang's name and address so that he could send the money back after returning to Kaifeng. This small incident that occurred in an ordinary store connected two strangers; later, Zheng Jiasheng and Li Wenguang corresponded and became friends from afar.
    Heartwarming stories like Li Wenguang treating customers like family and thoughtfully considering their difficulties are constantly emerging in Wuhan.

    Please Leave Your Name and Address
    This was an ordinary day. A customer came to the City Commercial Bureau's Experimental Store—Lifeng Department Store—to buy something. He was a purchasing agent from the Jingtoushan State-owned Farm in Yangxin County, Hubei. It just so happened that the store didn't have many raincoats he needed in stock, and the styles weren't quite to his liking. Li Zunzhi, a cadre of the City Commercial Bureau and a salesperson, seeing that he was unfamiliar with the area and it was getting late, asked the customer to leave his name and address, promising that he would deliver the goods before he left Wuhan. That evening, Li Zunzhi went to the warehouse to select raincoats. The next day, Li Zunzhi, in pouring rain, delivered a batch of raincoats to the customer on time as agreed. The customer was so moved that he thanked him repeatedly and requested to establish a long-term supply relationship with Lifeng Department Store. After completing the task, Li Zunzhi realized that he was soaked from head to toe and was sweating profusely, but he felt extremely happy because he had served the customer wholeheartedly once again.
    This "Please leave your name and address" service method is now being promoted in other stores. The Huangshi Road State-owned Retail Store has a register for customer's needed goods in each specialized counter, where customers can leave their name, address, and the name and quantity of the goods they want. When the goods are available, the store delivers them to their door.

    Open All Night
    Residents near Zhongshan Avenue and Huangshi Road in Hankou all know that there is such a retail store that can meet customer needs at any time. It turns out that this store has opened an early morning and late night service window. Whether it is in the middle of the night or at dawn, as long as customers knock on the window, the salesperson on duty sleeping in the store will immediately get up to sell them goods. In the month since the service window opened, it has received an average of more than a dozen extra customers every morning and evening. One night, two women rushed to buy milk powder because their children were waiting to be fed, and they couldn't buy it elsewhere. The salesperson quickly met their urgent need.

    Seamstresses Roaming the Streets and Alleys
    A new atmosphere has appeared in the streets and alleys of Wuhan: seamstresses in groups of two or three, carrying sewing machines and holding red flags, go to government agencies, enterprises, and neighborhoods to sew clothes for customers, turn collars, or mend holes.
    These are the mobile production service teams of the sewing industry. Through the rectification and commune movement, the sewing industry has changed its business style, adopting a business model of roaming the streets and alleys and providing door-to-door service, which is quite popular. The Hongxiang Woolen Fabric Production Cooperative's mobile service team implements "ten guarantees," including guaranteed acceptance, guaranteed delivery, guaranteed alteration, and guaranteed washing. One day, it met a customer at the street corner who was holding an old shirt. The service team proactively learned that he was planning to have it mended, so they set up a stall and replaced the collar with a new one for him in ten minutes. (Tao Jinzi) (Attached picture)

　　新夏新作风
    有一天，武汉市体育文具仪器批发兼零售商店接待了一个顾客，名叫郑家声。他是黄河勘测设计院的工作人员，有事从开封来到武汉。郑家声在商店乐器柜看中了一只秦琴，玩弄许久，爱不释手。营业员黎文广见他想买而又不买的样子很觉奇怪，就诚恳地问他有什么困难。郑家声说，他在开封找了很久，一直没有买到这样心爱的秦琴，现在好容易找到了，却又少带了钱。黎文广一听，马上表示要替他垫钱，帮助他实现宿愿。郑家声推让再三，最后终于接受了黎文广的好意，并且记下了黎文广的姓名和地址，等他回开封后，好把钱汇来。这件发生在一个普通商店里的生活小事，把两个素不相识的人联在一起；以后郑家声和黎文广通信来往，结成了远方的朋友。
    像黎文广这样待顾客如亲人，处处体贴顾客困难的动人事例，正在武汉市不断涌现出来。
    请你留下姓名和地址
    这是一个平常的日子。一个顾客来到市商业局试验商店——丽丰百货商店买东西，他是湖北阳新县荆头山国营农场的采购员。刚巧他需要买的雨衣商店里存货不多，式样也不太合他心意。市商业局干部、营业员李遵志见他人地生疏，天色也不早了，就请顾客留下姓名和地址，答应他一定在他离开武汉前把货送到。当天晚上，李遵志就赶到仓库去挑选雨衣。第二天，李遵志又在滂沱大雨中，按照约定时间，把一批雨衣送到了顾客手里，顾客感动得连声道谢，要求和丽丰百货商店建立长期供应关系。李遵志完成任务后，才发现自己混身上下都被雨水淋湿透了，额头还冒着热汗，但是他觉得无比愉快，因为他又尽心尽意地为顾客服务了一次。
    这种“请你留下姓名、地址”的服务方式，现在已开始在其他商店中推行。黄石路国营零售商店每个专业柜备有一本顾客需要商品登记簿，由顾客留下姓名、地址和要货名称、数量，等到有了货，商店就替他们送上门去。
    通宵营业
    汉口中山大道、黄石路附近的居民都知道有这样一家零售商店，它随时都可以满足顾客需要。原来，这家商店开设了一个早晚营业窗，不管在半夜还是拂晓，只要顾客敲一下窗，睡在店堂里值班的营业员就立即起身卖东西。营业窗开设一个多月来，平均每天早晚多接待了十几个顾客。有天晚上，两个妇女匆匆赶来买奶粉，因为小孩等着哺乳，别处又买不到。营业员很快满足了她们的急需。
    缝纫师游街串巷
    武汉市的街头巷尾，出现了一种新气象，缝纫师们三三两两地带着缝纫机，打着红旗，到机关企业、里弄中去给顾客缝衣服，翻领子或者补破洞。
    这些就是缝纫业的流动生产服务组。通过整风整社，缝纫业改变经营作风，采取游街串巷、服务上门的经营方式，颇受欢迎。虹翔呢绒生产社的流动服务组实行包接、包送、包改、包洗等“十包”。有天，它在街口遇见一个顾客，手里拿着一件旧衬衣；服务组主动了解到他准备拿去修补，便摆开摊子，花了十分钟时间就替他换好一条新领。（陶锦子）（附图片）
