President Ho Chi Minh said that the main characteristic of the current world situation is that the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war. It is possible to defend world peace. He added that the main factors conducive to peace and prosperity in Asia are: the expanding influence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the rising movement against colonialism and to safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and the unity of the Asian and African peoples and their love of peace.
