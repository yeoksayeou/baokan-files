    Nettles and Others

    In Comrade Ai Wu's article "Let Me Also Talk About Broken Bowl Flower" published in this newspaper on April 17th, he mentioned "a wild grass called 'He Ma' in Sichuan." This wild grass is also abundant in various parts of Guizhou, which is adjacent to Sichuan. It can be found everywhere not only in the mountains and fields, but also in the open spaces within small county towns and in the corners of people's backyards. It usually grows to about three feet tall, with oval leaves and serrated edges. The stems and leaves are covered with fine fluff. People will immediately feel a burning pain from the prick of these fine hairs upon touching it. When we were children, we didn't know of any medicine to treat it, so we could only rub the stung area of our hands vigorously on the coarse cloth clothes we wore. Fortunately, it would naturally heal after a short time.
    Comrade Ai Wu said that the name of this wild grass is He Ma, and also said "perhaps it should be called Ge Ma (割麻)." In the Guizhou dialect, there is a verb pronounced like "He" (according to dictionaries, it should be written as 蠚), which means being stung by something with coarse hair, but the tone is weaker than "刺" (to prick). This wild grass pricks people, so it is also called He Ma. In fact, its original name should be called Nettle (荨), also written as (燖) Ma. Because of its stinging characteristics, it had already attracted attention a long time ago. The great Tang Dynasty poets Du Fu and Bai Juyi both wrote about it in their poems. Song Dynasty Song Qi's "Yi Bu Fang Wu Lue Ji" and Zhang Bangji's "Mo Zhuang Man Lu", as well as Qing Dynasty Tian Wen's "Qian Shu", Chen Ding's "Qian You Ji" and Li Zongfang's "Qian Ji", all have records of nettles. In addition, there must be many records in the local chronicles of Sichuan and Guizhou. Here, let's take a look at a passage from Tian Wen's "Qian Shu", Volume 4: "Nettle grass, also known as Xun Ma, is found in Qian and Shu. It grows between fences and streams. The leaves are like hemp, with many stinging hairs that cause unbearable swelling and pain when they sting human hands and feet. Du Zimei's so-called 'Grass is harmful to people; why was its growth not stopped; Its poison is even worse than bees and scorpions; Its abundance fills the roads' is what he meant. Those who do not know often fall victim to it. Comparing its poison to that of bees, scorpions, and vipers is hardly an exaggeration. It should be hoed up and placed in water to prevent it from spreading. This is the way to keep it away. However, the locals collect it, pour boiling water on it to cure leprosy, and also to fatten pigs. The world has no useless things." This passage describes the nettle's shape, characteristics, and uses in great detail. Comrade Ai Wu said, "Farmers hate this grass the most and hoe it up when they see it, perhaps it has become extinct. I think it can also be researched to extract useful medicine from the poisonous grass." After reading Tian Wen's record, we know that it can indeed be used as medicine. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," Volume 17, also says that it mainly treats "snake venom" and "urticaria," and is a useful medicine. Tian Wen also said that it can "fatten pigs," which I already knew when I was in Guizhou. The farmers there sometimes cut it down, stems and leaves together, and mix it in the feed to boil and feed the pigs. It is not completely hoed up when seen. The fiber of its stem bark can also be used as a raw material for spinning and weaving. Although it is a very annoying weed, it has three uses: treating diseases, feeding pigs, and serving as a raw material for fabrics.
    In addition, I saw a message in the People's Daily and Beijing Daily on April 24 that a restaurant run by a supply and marketing cooperative in Fengjie County, Sichuan, uses only local wild animals and plants as raw materials, including braised noodles made with kudzu root powder and fern rhizome powder, which can be eaten as rice. These two wild plants are also found in Guizhou. We usually only eat kudzu root as a fruit. I remember when I was a child, I would meet people from the countryside who came to the city to sell kudzu root, carrying a bamboo basket with a chopping board, a knife, and kudzu roots as thick as arms. We would give them a copper coin, and they would cut off a slice or two for us. But because it has a very strong medicinal taste, we don't like to eat it very much. Fern rhizome, that is, fern sprouts, can be found almost everywhere in the mountains in spring. Its petioles are slightly as thick as chopsticks, and the tender leaves at the tip are curled up like fists, reddish-brown. After picking them, they are soaked in water for a day to remove the astringent taste, and then stir-fried as a vegetable. But I had never heard of these two things being made into braised noodles and sold in restaurants before. This is a completely new method that has been thought of now. From this, it can be seen that as long as we carefully study them, we can discover various new uses for the countless wild plants in various places. Our goal of asking for wine, powder, and cotton from the deep mountains and old forests will definitely be achieved.

    荨麻及其他
    林辰
    艾芜同志在4月17日本版发表的“我也来谈谈打破碗花花”一文中，曾经提到四川的“一种叫做合麻的野草”。这种野草，在同四川邻近的贵州各地也很多，不光是生长在山野，就是在小县城内的空地上和人家后园的角落里，也可以随处发现。一般大约不过三尺来高，叶卵形，有锯齿，茎叶上都长着茸茸的细毛，人们只要一碰到它，便立即被这种细毛刺得火辣辣地发痛。我们小时候被它刺着，不知道有什么药可治，只有将手上刺痛的地方放在身上穿的土布衣服上用力磨擦，幸而不消多久也就自然好了。
    这种野草的名称，艾芜同志说叫做合麻，又说“也许应该叫做割麻”。贵州方言中有个动词读如“呵”（照字书应写作蠚），意思是被粗毛一类的东西刺着，但语气较刺为弱，这种野草会刺人，所以也称为呵麻。其实它本来的名称应该叫做荨（一写作燖）麻。由于它具有这种刺人的特性，很早以前就已经被人注意，唐朝大诗人杜甫和白居易都曾将它写入诗中，宋朝宋祁的“益部方物略记”和张邦基的“墨庄漫录”以至清朝田雯的“黔书”、陈鼎的“黔游记”、李宗昉的“黔记”等书中，也都各有关于荨麻的记录，此外，在川黔各地方志中，一定还有很多记载。这里我们且看看田雯“黔书”卷四中的一则：“荨草，即燖麻，黔蜀有之，生于篱落溪崖间，叶类麻，毛多刺，螫人手足，肿痛至不可忍。杜子美所谓‘草有害于人，曾何生阻修；其毒甚蜂虿，其多弥道周’是也。不知者往往为其所中，比其毒于蜂虿蝎蝮，殆不为过，鉏而去之，置诸水中，勿使滋蔓，所以远恶也。然土人采之，沃以沸汤，则可已疯，亦可肥豕，世固无弃物哉。”这段文字记述荨麻的形态，特性和用途，相当详尽；艾芜同志说，“这种草农民最讨厌它，见了就锄去，可能已绝迹，我想也可以研究下子，在毒草中取出有用的药来。”看了田雯的记载，可知它的确可以做药，李时珍“本草纲目”卷十七也说它主治“蛇毒”和“风疹”，是一种有用的药物。田雯又说它可以“肥豕”，这是我以前在贵州时便早已知道的，那里的农民有时将它连茎带叶一同割下，混合在饲料里煮来喂猪，并不是完全一见就锄去。它的茎皮的纤维，还可供纺织作为原料。虽是一种很讨人厌的野草，却具备着治病、喂猪和作织物原料的三种用途。
    此外，在4月24日的人民日报和北京日报上又见到一则消息说，四川奉节县一个供销社所办的餐馆，完全是用当地野生动植物作原料，其中有用葛根粉、蕨台粉做的烩面，可当饭吃。这两种野生植物，贵州也有。葛根，我们通常只当它水果吃，我还记得小时候，遇见乡间到城里来卖葛根的人，手提竹篮，篮内放着一块砧板，一把刀，和一根根手臂粗的葛根，我们给一个铜板，他便切给一片或两片。但因为它带着极大的药味，我们都不大喜欢吃。蕨台，即蕨菜台，一到春天，几乎满山都有，它的叶柄略有筷子粗细，尖端嫩叶卷曲如拳，赤褐色，采来以后，先用水泡一天，去其涩味，然后炒来当菜吃。但这两种东西，我以前从来没有听说可以制成烩面在餐馆里出售，这完全是现在想出来的新办法。由此可见，只要仔细加以研究，就可发现各地无可计数的野生植物的种种新用途，我们向深山老林要酒、要粉、要棉……的目的，是一定可以达到的。
