    High-Frequency Electric Grinding Wheel Spindle
    A cutting-edge technology product in machine manufacturing—the high-frequency electric grinding wheel spindle for high-speed precision internal grinding machines—has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Bearing Factory.
    In the past, the Harbin Bearing Factory relied entirely on imports for this type of high-frequency electric grinding wheel spindle. At the beginning of this year, the First Ministry of Machine Building listed this product as one of the research topics during the Second Five-Year Plan period.
    The factory's deputy chief engineer originally believed that the factory's equipment and technical level were not capable of producing such an advanced product. As a result, the workers broke down superstitions during the Great Leap Forward and finally trial-produced it. To this end, the workers held a short celebration meeting in the batch workshop. The deputy chief engineer said with emotion at the meeting: "I looked at technology too mysteriously. My understanding of the power of the masses was insufficient, and politics was not put in command."

    高频率电动砂轮轴
    机器制造业上的一种尖端技术产品——高速精密内圆磨床的高频率电动砂轮轴，最近在哈尔滨轴承厂试制成功。
    哈尔滨轴承厂使用的这种高频率电动砂轮轴，过去一直都是依靠国外进口。在今年年初，第一机械工业部曾经把这种产品列为第二个五年计划期间的研究课题之一。
    这个工厂的副总工程师原来认为工厂的设备和技术水平都不能做这样高级的产品。结果职工们在大跃进中破除迷信，终于把它试制出来了。为此，职工们在成批车间举行了一个简短的庆祝会。副总工程师在会上感慨地说：“我把技术看得太神秘了。对群众的力量认识不足、政治没挂帅。”
