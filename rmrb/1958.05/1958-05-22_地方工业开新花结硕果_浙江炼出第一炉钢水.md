    Local Industries Blossom and Bear Fruit
    Zhejiang Refines Its First Batch of Molten Steel

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Zhejiang Daily, on the morning of the 17th, the steelmaking workshop of the Zhejiang Steel Plant refined its first batch of molten steel.

    During the construction of the Zhejiang Steel Plant, conventional methods were broken, and simultaneous surveying, design, material preparation, and construction were adopted. It only took eight months to build the steelmaking workshop. Through technological innovation, No. 1 converter reasonably thinned the furnace lining, enlarged the furnace body, and its output could be increased by two-thirds. After the improvement of the blast furnace’s wind chamber, its height was doubled, and the steelmaking time was also greatly shortened.

    The newly built No. 1 converter is characterized by flexible operation and rapid steelmaking. It can refine 50 to 60 batches of steel in a day and night. Its first batch of steel is of good quality. The test results show that it is Grade A ordinary steel. The annual output of this workshop is 45,000 tons. In the future, this factory will continue to build steel casting, steel rolling, and coking workshops, and gradually build a joint iron and steel enterprise. (Attached picture)

    地方工业开新花结硕果
    浙江炼出第一炉钢水
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：17日晨，浙江钢铁厂炼钢车间炼出了第一炉钢水。
    浙江钢铁厂在建设过程中，打破常规，采取了边勘测、边设计、边备料、边施工的方法，建设炼钢车间的时间只花了八个月。一号转炉经过技术革新，合理减薄炉层，炉身扩大，产量可以增加三分之二。化铁炉的风室经过改进，加高了一倍，炼钢时间也缩短不少。
    新建一号转炉的特点是操作灵活，炼钢迅速，一昼夜可炼五十到六十炉钢。它的第一炉钢质量良好，检验结果，为甲级普通钢。这个车间的年产量达四万五千吨。以后这个厂还将继续兴建铸钢、轧钢、炼焦等车间，逐步建成一个钢铁联合企业。（附图片）
