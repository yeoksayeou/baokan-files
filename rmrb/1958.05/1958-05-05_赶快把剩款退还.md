    Return the Remaining Payment Quickly
    In August and September of last year, we sent a letter to the Beijing Daming Typewriter Company (No. 10 Guazidian Street, Qianmen District) to order some type. They replied that they had the goods and needed 50 yuan. We remitted the money in full, but the type sent back was only worth 22 yuan and 63 fen. The remaining money has not been returned. We have repeatedly written to them, but so far not only have we not received a refund, we haven't even received a reply. Do they intend to keep this money without returning it to us?

    赶快把剩款退还
    去年8、9月间，我们曾经给北京市大明打字机行（前门区瓜子店街十号）函购一部分铅字。他们回信说有货，需款五十元。我们把钱如数汇去，但发回来的铅字只值二十二元六角三分，剩下的款子一直没有寄还。我们一再去信要，至今不但没退款，连个回信都没有。难道说想把这笔钱不还给我们了吗？
