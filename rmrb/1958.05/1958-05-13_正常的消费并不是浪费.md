Normal Consumption Is Not Wasteful
By Our Newspaper Commentator

    Since the Central Committee of the Party issued the call for building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift last year, all parts of the country have successively convened representative meetings of activists in managing households with diligence and thrift. After extensive and in-depth publicity and education, a new atmosphere of advocating thrift has now formed among the people of the whole country. This is a very gratifying major change in the spiritual outlook of our society. This is of great significance not only economically but also politically.

    As everyone knows, our country was originally an economically backward country. It is not an easy task to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science, and culture; there are many difficulties. For example, construction requires a huge amount of investment, and our funds can only rely on our own internal accumulation. But as long as we rely on the masses, work hard, and resolutely implement the policy of practicing strict economy and opposing waste, we will have a way to overcome the difficulty of funding sources. The current situation is exactly like this. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his famous speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We want to carry out large-scale construction, but our country is still a very poor country. This is a contradiction. Comprehensively and persistently practicing economy is a way to resolve this contradiction."

    In the previous period, among some people, mainly among some young people, there was a dangerous tendency to pursue material enjoyment, spending a lot of energy on comparing lives and comparing treatment. This was very bad and detrimental to national construction and internal unity among the people. The current situation has greatly changed after the rectification movement. But this fact shows that our ideological and political education in this area in the past was very insufficient. Many young people, due to a lack of revolutionary training, do not understand the difficulties of starting a business, and it is not easy to deeply understand that building our country into a beautiful socialist society requires a hard effort. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly conduct ideological education on diligence and thrift among the masses so that all the people understand that to concentrate efforts on building socialism and make our country prosperous and strong, we must currently promote thrift and oppose waste in all aspects, including the people's lives.

    However, recently another noteworthy situation has emerged. That is, some people have a very one-sided understanding of managing households with diligence and thrift, opposing normal consumption and thrift, thinking that advocating thrift means you can no longer buy things, or treating making a new piece of clothing, buying a new pair of shoes, listening to a play, watching a movie, ordering an A-grade dish in the cafeteria, etc., all as waste and dishonorable. Some places criticize any consumption that exceeds the minimum standard of living as waste. As a result, some people dare not even buy legitimate necessities, and dare not even take out and use their existing clothes. This understanding is obviously not comprehensive and is detrimental to social production.

    As everyone knows, our country's economy is a socialist economy. The characteristics of a socialist economy are planned production and planned distribution. A part of socialist production is used for expanded reproduction, and a part is used to directly supply the people's living needs; and the part used for expanded reproduction is ultimately to meet the people's growing consumption needs. Therefore, Marxists believe that: production determines consumption, and production is also for consumption. Under the socialist system, the growth of consumption needs stimulates the development of production and becomes the driving force of production. At the same time, the development of production also stimulates the growth of consumption needs. Under socialist conditions, due to the fundamental change in the ownership of the means of production, all national income belongs to the working people. Of course, the principle that all national income belongs to the working people does not mean that every worker completely obtains all the value he creates from the state. Because if this were the case, the state would have no possibility of accumulation and expanded reproduction, and no possibility of meeting the people's indispensable public needs in cultural education, national defense, and many other aspects of society as a whole. Therefore, national income is divided into two parts, one part is accumulation, and the other part is consumption, that is, personal income. Under the socialist system, labor is a means of livelihood, everyone must work, and everyone's income depends on his work. Socialist relations of production guarantee that the income of the working people gradually increases with the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the continuous expansion of production. Therefore, people's concern for expanding and consolidating the state and collective economic undertakings, as well as their concern for the personal material interests of socialist production, is a huge driving force for socialist production. Objective laws are always like this: the growth of social production creates conditions for the improvement of people's consumption levels, and stimulates the production of new consumption needs; the growth of people's consumption needs and the increase in purchasing power opens up broad prospects for the development of production, thus stimulating the further development of production. This cycle promotes the development of the entire national economy to a continuous upswing, and the scope of people's material and spiritual consumer goods continues to expand. Therefore, under the socialist system, the crisis of overproduction is fundamentally impossible to occur. Production and consumption mutually promote the development of social productive forces. Therefore, our economy is always rising. When more things are produced, the improvement of people's lives is guaranteed. This is the great superiority of the socialist economic system, which cannot be compared with the capitalist economy.

    From the current point of view, our country does not produce many things, and material reserves are not very abundant, and we cannot meet the requirements of greatly developing production and greatly improving the people's living standards. Therefore, in order to build socialism, we advocate hard work, and we advocate practicing strict economy in all aspects. However, in terms of people's daily lives, we only require the people to resolutely obey the state's distribution plan, educate the people to understand that improving living standards can only be gradual and cannot be achieved overnight, but it is not to say that everyone should not have legitimate food, clothing, and use, and it is not to reduce the existing living standards. If this is the case, it will be detrimental to the development of production. Therefore, things that should be bought should still be bought, and it is not impossible to buy some higher-quality goods if economic conditions permit and there is a need. Because the consumer goods produced by the state are for sale, and normal consumption is not waste. As for watching movies, listening to plays, etc. in addition to work, they are normal cultural life, and as long as they do not waste work and study, they should not be considered waste. Now many places and individuals have cancelled some newspapers and periodicals that should be subscribed to in the name of saving, which is obviously also a misunderstanding.

    In short, practicing strict economy and opposing waste is a policy that must be followed throughout the socialist construction period. Even in the future when we reach communism, wasting public wealth and squandering will not be allowed. But on the other hand, normal personal consumption under the state's planned distribution cannot be regarded as waste. Due to the different levels of income, there are some differences in consumption standards, which is also normal, and of course, the gap should not be too large.

### 正常的消费并不是浪费

　　正常的消费并不是浪费
　　本报评论员
    自从党中央在去年提出勤俭建国、勤俭持家的号召以后，全国各地都先后召开了勤俭持家积极分子代表会议，经过广泛深入的宣传教育，目前在全国人民中间已经形成了一种崇尚节俭的新风气。这是我国社会的精神面貌的一个十分可喜的大变化。这不但在经济上有重大意义，在政治上也有重大意义。
    大家都知道，我国原是一个经济上很落后的国家，现在要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，并不是一件轻而易举的事，是有不少困难的。比如要建设就要投入巨量资金，而我们的资金又只能靠自己的内部积累。但是只要我们依靠群众、艰苦奋斗，坚决执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针，我们就有办法克服资金来源的困难。现在的情况正是这样。正如毛泽东同志在他那篇著名的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中所指出的：“我们要进行大规模的建设，但是我国还是一个很穷的国家，这是一个矛盾。全面地持久地厉行节约，就是解决这个矛盾的一个方法。”
    前一个时期，在一部分人中间、主要是在一部分青年人中间，曾经滋长着一种追求物质享受的危险倾向，把很多精力用在比生活、比待遇上面，这是很不好的，是不利于国家建设和人民内部团结的。目前这种情况经过整风运动已经有了很大的改变。但是通过这个事实说明，过去我们在这方面的思想政治教育工作是很不够的，不少青年人由于缺乏革命锻炼，还不大懂得创业的艰难，不容易深切了解把我们这样一个国家建设成为一个美好的社会主义社会，必须要经过一番艰苦的努力。因此，需要在群众中间反复进行勤俭的思想教育，使全体人民都懂得要集中力量建设社会主义，使我国繁荣富强起来，目前我们就必须在各个方面其中也包括人民生活方面提倡节约，反对浪费。
    但是，近来也出现了另一种值得注意的情况。就是有些人对勤俭持家作了非常片面的理解，把正常的消费和节约对立了起来，以为提倡节约就不能再买东西了，或者把做一件新衣，买一双新鞋，听一场戏，看一场电影，在机关食堂吃饭要一个甲等菜等等，都一律看作是浪费和不光荣的。有的地方把凡是超过最低生活标准的消费都当作浪费来批评。因而有些人就连正当的必需消费品也不敢买了，连已有的衣物也不敢拿出来穿用了。这种认识显然是不全面的，对社会生产也是不利的。
    大家都知道我们国家的经济是社会主义经济。社会主义经济的特点就是计划生产和计划分配。社会主义生产的一部分用于扩大再生产，一部分用来直接供应人民生活需要；而用于扩大再生产的部分，归根到底也是为了满足人民日益增长的消费需要。因此马克思主义者认为：生产决定消费，生产也是为了消费。在社会主义制度下，消费需要的增长刺激生产的发展，成为生产的动力，同时，生产的发展也刺激消费需要的增长。在社会主义条件下，由于生产资料所有制的根本改变，全部国民收入都归劳动人民所有了。当然，全部国民收入归劳动人民所有这一原则，绝不是说，每个劳动者都从国家完全获得他所创造的一切价值。因为如果这样，国家就没有可能进行积累和扩大再生产，没有可能满足人们在文化教育、国防以及整个社会其他许多方面必不可少的公共需要。因此国民收入被分配作两个部分，一部分是积累，一部分是消费，也就是个人收入部分。在社会主义制度下，劳动是生活的手段，所有的人都必需劳动，每个人的收入决定于他的工作。社会主义生产关系，保证劳动人民的这种收入随着劳动生产率的不断提高和生产的不断扩大而逐渐增加。因此，人们对于扩大和巩固国家和集体经济事业的关心，以及对于社会主义生产的个人物质利益的关心，乃是社会主义生产的一种巨大的推动力量。客观规律总是这样：社会生产的增长，为人民消费水平的提高创造着条件，并且刺激新的消费需要的生产；人民消费需要的增长及其购买力的提高，为生产的发展开辟着广阔的前途，因而又刺激着生产的进一步发展。如此循环往复，就促使整个国民经济的发展趋于不断高涨，人民的物质和精神消费品的范围也随之不断扩大。所以，在社会主义制度下，生产过剩的危机是根本不可能发生的。生产和消费相互促进社会生产力的发展，因此，我们的经济总是不断上升的。生产的东西多了，人民生活的改善就有保障。这是社会主义经济制度的巨大优越性，是资本主义经济无法与之比拟的。
    从目前来看，我们国家生产的东西还不是很多，物资储备还不是很宽裕，还不能满足大大发展生产、大大提高人民生活水平的要求。所以，为了建设社会主义，我们提倡苦战，提倡从各个方面厉行节约。但是，在人民日常生活方面，只是要求人民坚决服从国家的分配计划，教育人民懂得改善生活只能是逐渐的，不可能一步登天，但也并不是要大家连正当的吃、穿、用都不要了，更不是要人民降低现有的生活水平。如果是这样，反而不利于生产的发展。因此，应该买的东西还是应该买，经济条件许可而又有需要购买一些质量较高的商品也并不是不可以的。因为国家生产出来的消费品就是为了卖的，而正常的消费并不是浪费。至于在工作之余看电影、听戏等等，则是属于正常的文化生活，只要不因此而荒废了工作学习，当然更不应当算是浪费了。现在不少地方和个人把一些应当订阅的报刊，也在节约的名义下取消了，这显然也是一种误解。
    总之，厉行节约、反对浪费，这是整个社会主义建设时期所必须遵循的方针。即使将来到了共产主义，浪费公共财富和大肆挥霍，也将是不容许的。但是另外一方面，在国家有计划分配下的个人的正常消费，是不能当作浪费的。由于各人的收入多少不同，因而消费的标准也多少有些差别，这也是正常的，当然也不应当悬殊过大。
