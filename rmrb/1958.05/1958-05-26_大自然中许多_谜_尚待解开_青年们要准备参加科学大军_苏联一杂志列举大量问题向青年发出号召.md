Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 25th. The Soviet magazine "Young Technician" recently published a special issue of questions, focusing on problems in geophysics, biology, archeology, and astronomy. It listed a large number of "mysteries" that have not yet been solved by the scientific community, calling on the younger generation of the Soviet Union to join the scientific army in the near future and attack these secrets of nature.

The magazine said that in the study of the origin of life, how to make artificial proteins and why simple molecules can act as carriers of genetic properties have not been resolved. Why did the huge mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and dinosaurs that were once so prosperous on Earth disappear?

There are also many mysteries in human history. Is the legendary Atlantis, a country with a high degree of culture that later sank entirely into the Atlantic Ocean, a fact? What is the meaning of the script found on Easter Island (Pasqua Island) in the Pacific Ocean? What is the meaning of the labyrinthine murals left over from ancient times in the suburbs of Cordoba, Argentina, and the areas of ?ken and Santa Cruz?

Soviet scientists have created the theory of superconductivity, explaining why certain substances allow current to pass freely at extremely low temperatures. However, is it possible to obtain superconductivity at relatively high temperatures? The use of nuclear energy is also a problem that needs to be further solved. Ball lightning in nature (a fireball that appears in the air after thunder, it can move up and down and back and forth, and it takes many minutes to disappear) is still a mystery. Animals such as dogs and butterflies can track by scent. Can humans create "odor locators"?

The Earth itself has many mysteries. For example, is Antarctica really a single continent? How did the thick ice layer of Antarctica form? Are the continents fixed or drifting slowly? Geologists have calculated that there are 522 volcanoes on Earth. How did these volcanoes form? Where do they get the energy needed for eruption? There is a so-called "sound channel" at the bottom of the ocean, which can ensure that sound travels thousands of kilometers away. How did this "sound channel" form? Why are there almost no creatures at a water depth of 800 to 1200 meters, while life is boiling above and below this layer? At one time, Australia was covered with ice floes, and tropical plants grew in the Arctic, which means that the Earth's poles can change, and the Earth's magnetic poles are also changing. How is the Earth's magnetism generated? Why does it change?

The universe is even more full of questions. In 1803, scientists discovered "Gegenschein," that is, at night, a very weak, greenish, elliptical bright spot sometimes appears in the sky directly opposite the sun. Soviet scientists have proved that this is the projection of the Earth's gas tail in the sky. However, since this tail is in the shadow of the Earth, why does it glow? Do other planets have such tails?

The surface of the moon has many craters, some of which have diameters of tens of kilometers. There are also some bright lines radiating from the craters, some of which are thousands of kilometers long. Some craters on the moon suddenly appear and suddenly disappear. Dark spots appear at the bottom of some craters, some dark spots are greenish, and their shape and position also change. What are the reasons for these?

What is the situation on the other side of the moon that we cannot see?

The 1956 Mars opposition (the closest moment to Earth) added many new mysteries to the scientific community. Why are there so many clouds on Mars when there is so little water? Why does the color of the "sea" on Mars change with the seasons? According to observations in 1956, the "canal" structure on Mars is more complex than previously depicted.

How did the many asteroids between Mars and Jupiter form? How were Saturn's rings formed? Why does the sun shine? What is the energy source of other stars? How do stars occur, develop, and die? A galaxy is composed of billions of stars, and hundreds of thousands of galaxies have now been discovered. These also need to be further understood.

    大自然中许多“谜”尚待解开  青年们要准备参加科学大军
    苏联一杂志列举大量问题向青年发出号召
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联“少年技术家”杂志最近出版了一期问题专辑，环绕地球物理、生物学、考古学和天文学等方面的问题，列举了大量科学界尚未解决的“谜”，号召苏联青年一代在不久的将来参加到科学大军中来，向这些大自然秘密冲击。
    杂志说，在研究生命的起源中，如何制成人造蛋白质，为什么简单的分子可以充当遗传性质的物质承担者，都未得到解决。在地球上盛极一时的巨大的沧龙、蛇颈龙、恐龙等为什么会消失？
    在人类历史上也存在不少的谜。传说纷纭的一个具有高度文化、后来整个陆沉于大西洋中的国家——阿特兰提斯（大西洲），究竟是不是事实？太平洋中复活节岛（帕斯库阿岛）上发现的文字是什么意思？阿根廷的科尔多瓦城郊和?肯、圣克卢斯地区一些古代遗留下来的迷宫式壁画究竟是什么意思？
    苏联科学家已经创造出了超导电理论，解释了某些物质在超低温时可以让电流全部自由通过的原因。但是，是不是能在比较高的温度下获得超导电效应呢？利用原子核能也是尚待进一步解决的问题。自然界中的球形闪电（打雷后在空中出现的火球，它可以上下前后移动，要过许多分钟才会消失）到现在仍然是谜。狗、蝴蝶等动物可以根据气味追踪，人类是否也可造出“气味定位器”？
    地球本身就有不少的谜。例如，南极到底是不是一块整体的大陆？南极的厚冰层如何形成的？各大洲是固定不动的还是缓慢漂移的？地质学家计算，地球上有五百二十二个火山，这些火山如何形成？从那里取得喷发所需的能？洋底有所谓“声道”，它可以保证声音传到几千公里远。这种“声道”如何形成的？为什么在水深八百到一千二百公尺的地方几乎没有生物，而在这一层以上和以下都沸腾着生活？有一时期，澳大利亚曾经积满浮冰，北极生长着热带植物，就是说地球两极是会变的，地球的磁极也在变化。地磁如何产生的？为什么会变化？
    宇宙中更是充满了问题。1803年，科学家就发现了“对日照”，即在夜间在天空中与太阳位置正相对的地方有时会出现一个极微弱的发绿色的椭圆形亮斑。苏联科学家证明，这是地球的气体尾巴在天穹中的投影。然而这个尾巴既然处于地球阴影中，为什么会发亮？其它行星是否也有这样的尾巴？
    月亮表面有许多环形山，有些环的直径达几十公里。还有一些亮线从环形山辐射开来，有的亮线长达几千公里。月面上有些环形山会突然出现，也会突然消失。一些环形山的底部会出现暗斑，有些暗斑带绿色，它们的形状和位置也会改变。这些都是什么原因造成的？
    我们看不到的月亮的另一面又是什么情况？
    1956年火星大冲（离地球最近的时刻）给科学界增加了许多新的谜。火星上水分少为什么云那么多？火星上的“海”的颜色为什么会随季节变化？根据1956年观察，火星上的“运河”结构比早先描绘的更复杂了。
    火星和木星之间的许多小行星怎样形成的？土星的环是怎样形成的？太阳为什么会发亮？其它恒星的能源是什么？恒星如何发生、发展和消亡？一个银河系由数以十亿计的恒星组成，而现在已经发现了几十万个银河系。这些也待进一步了解。
