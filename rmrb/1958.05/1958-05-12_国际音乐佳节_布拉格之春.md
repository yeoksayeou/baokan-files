　　International Music Festival "Prague Spring"

　　The famous international music festival "Prague Spring" was founded in 1946. In May of that year, the "Prague Spring" International Music Festival held in Czechoslovakia was widely welcomed by musicians from various countries. Subsequently, the Czechoslovak government decided to hold an "Prague Spring" International Music Festival every spring, during the most beautiful season in Prague, so that artists from all over the world could gather here and establish friendly connections. Initially, "Prague Spring" was just musical performances. Starting in 1953, it added opera, folk dances and other programs.

　　"Prague Spring" is a peaceful gathering of musicians regardless of nationality, race, or political belief. Every year, musicians from socialist countries and progressive musicians from capitalist countries participate in this grand event. Here, they perform classical and modern musical works with high artistic skills, and also introduce the latest works of musicians from various countries to audiences around the world. "Prague Spring" has become a powerful review of musicians around the world striving for international cooperation and peace. The symbol of "Prague Spring" - a blue flag printed with a white violin bow - has become a world-renowned flag of peaceful music.

　　Since 1947, an international competition for young musicians has also been held during the annual "Prague Spring" music festival. So far, the competition has been held ten times. The competition programs vary each year. In the past, there have been piano, wind instruments, singing, cello, violin and other events. During the past music festivals, international conferences of composers and music theorists have also been held several times. Musicians from various countries exchange opinions and interact with each other here, further deepening the friendship and unity between the people of various countries.

　　"Prague Spring" has always been a music festival that the people and musicians of our country value and care about. Since 1951, our country has sent musicians to participate every year. 1956 was the largest of all the music festivals. During the festival, the Chinese delegation held three large-scale concerts, introducing Chinese folk songs and music to audiences from various countries. These performances were warmly welcomed by the audience. In 1957, Li Mingqiang, a young pianist in the Chinese delegation, won the third prize in the third Smetana International Piano Competition held at the music festival.

　　国际音乐佳节“布拉格之春”
    著名的国际音乐佳节“布拉格之春”创立于1946年。当年5月，在捷克斯洛伐克举行的“布拉格之春”国际音乐节，受到了各国音乐家的普遍欢迎。之后，捷克斯洛伐克政府决定在每年春天，在布拉格最美丽的季节，举办一次“布拉格之春”国际音乐节，以便全世界的艺术家们在这里相聚，建立友谊的联系。在最初，“布拉格之春”只是音乐表演。从1953年开始，它又增添了歌剧、民间舞蹈等节目。
    “布拉格之春”是一个不分民族、种族和政治信仰的音乐家的和平大集会。每年参加这个盛会的有各社会主义国家的音乐家，也有各资本主义国家的进步音乐家。他们在这里以高度的艺术技巧，表演古典和现代的音乐作品，也把各国音乐家的最新作品介绍给各国听众。“布拉格之春”成了全世界音乐家争取国际合作与和平的强大检阅。“布拉格之春”的象征——印着白色提琴弓的蓝色旗帜，成为闻名世界的和平音乐旗织。
    从1947年起，在每年“布拉格之春”音乐节期间还举行青年音乐家的国际竞赛，到目前为止，竞赛已经举行了十次。竞赛节目每年不同，过去举行的有钢琴、管乐、歌唱、大提琴、小提琴等项。在历届音乐节期间，还几度举行了作曲家和音乐理论家的国际代表大会。各国音乐家们在这里交换意见和相互接触，进一步加深了各国人民之间的友谊和团结。
    “布拉格之春”一直是我国人民和音乐家们重视和关心的音乐节日。从1951年起，我国每年都派有音乐家参加。1956年是历届音乐节中规模最大的一次，我国代表团在节日期间举行了三次较大规模的音乐会，把中国民间的歌曲和音乐介绍给各国听众。这些表演受到听众热烈的欢迎。1957年，我国代表团中的青年钢琴家李名强在音乐节举办的第三次斯麦塔那国际钢琴比赛中获得三等奖。
