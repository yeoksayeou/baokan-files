Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on April 29 to discuss the issue raised by the Soviet Union regarding "taking urgent measures to stop American military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border."

During the Security Council's discussion of this issue on April 21, the US representative, Lodge, used his authority as chairman to obstruct serious discussion in every possible way. However, this Security Council meeting was convened at the insistence of the US delegation itself, which put forward a so-called Arctic inspection issue, attempting to use it to replace the Soviet Union's concern about the provocative flights of US aircraft.

The Soviet delegation submitted a proposal to the meeting stating that the Security Council believes that such flights by US aircraft exacerbate tensions between countries, pose a threat to the security of people of all countries, and that continuing such flights could undermine universal peace and trigger a devastating atomic war. Therefore, it requests the United States to stop such flights. The proposal also states that the Security Council notes with satisfaction that negotiations are underway between the relevant countries to reach an agreement on convening a meeting with the participation of heads of government to discuss pressing international issues, including the formulation of measures to prevent the threat of surprise attacks. The Security Council expresses the hope that a meeting with the participation of heads of government will be held in the shortest possible time.

After the meeting began, Soviet representative Sobolev asked the US representative Lodge, who was chairing the meeting, whether he intended to use a procedural rule whereby the chairman could temporarily hand over his chairmanship to other members of the Security Council when discussing issues related to his own country. Sobolev pointed out that it was difficult to determine in the last meeting when Lodge was speaking in his capacity as chairman and when he was speaking as the US representative.

Lodge replied that he did not intend to use this procedural rule. He then spoke in his capacity as the US representative. Lodge put forward a proposal to "establish international inspection in the Arctic region to prevent sudden attacks." According to the US proposal, the provocative flights of US aircraft would be legalized through the establishment of a so-called Arctic "international aerial inspection," and US bombers would continue to fly near the Soviet border in the Arctic region, only this time not under the US banner, but under the guise of the United Nations. The United States has repeatedly misappropriated the name and flag of the United Nations to take sinister provocative actions.

Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union's appeal to the Security Council has aroused widespread response around the world. Instead of taking a correct decision to stop US bombers from flying towards the Soviet Union, the US government is playing tricks to divert attention in the Security Council. The US proposal is intended to secretly replace the issue of preventing US aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from making provocative flights towards the Soviet border with a proposal on conducting Arctic inspections, attempting to shirk the responsibility of the US government for the tensions caused by the provocative actions of US aircraft.

Sobolev pointed out that the US proposal on international inspection of the region north of the Arctic Circle not only does not help to prevent the danger of sudden attacks and ease international tensions, but also shows that the people who put forward this proposal are trying to divert the Security Council away from the important issues raised by the Soviet Union. They also want to obtain intelligence data on a large part of Soviet territory, while the Soviet Union has neither sent bombers towards the US border nor posed any threat to the United States or any other country.

The tense situation is entirely caused by the United States sending aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs to fly towards the Soviet border. In order to eliminate this tense situation, it is only necessary to ask the US government to make a decision to immediately stop such flights.

Sobolev pointed out that the US proposal separates the Arctic inspection issue from the entire disarmament issue. The composition of the countries proposed in the US proposal to participate in the discussion of the Arctic inspection issue is more one-sided than the composition of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, and it discusses the inspection issue completely separate from any disarmament issues. By doing so, the US government is attempting to use a voting method in an organization where most member states have military agreements with the United States to make an imposed decision on a disarmament issue, rather than seeking mutually acceptable agreements between the relevant countries.

Sobolev said that it is impossible to solve disarmament issues by voting. The only realistic path is to conduct negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual recognition of the need to guarantee the security of both sides. The Soviet government believes that a meeting with the participation of heads of government can most effectively take practical measures to prevent the threat of war and shift the entire international situation towards normalization. The Soviet Union suggests that such major issues be discussed at this meeting, and that concrete measures be taken that, once agreed upon, would put the resolution of the entire disarmament issue on a practical track.

Representatives from Britain, France, and other countries that are subservient to the United States obscured the true purpose of the US proposal, attempting to portray the US proposal as a means of guaranteeing "security" and even "building trust." They ignored a very obvious fact: only when the US Air Force unconditionally stops provocative flights can genuine trust be established, which is necessary to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld spoke at the meeting. He expressed his support for the US proposal. His speech was unprecedented, because according to tradition the United Nations Secretary-General cannot support any one country.

The Security Council meeting ended after Hammarskjöld's speech. The discussion will continue on May 2nd.

### 安理会继续讨论美机在苏联边境挑衅问题  苏联要求通过首脑会议防止突袭威胁  美国玩弄所谓“北极空中视察”阴谋企图使挑衅飞行合法化

    安理会继续讨论美机在苏联边境挑衅问题
    苏联要求通过首脑会议防止突袭威胁
    美国玩弄所谓“北极空中视察”阴谋企图使挑衅飞行合法化
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会4月29日举行会议，讨论苏联所提出的“关于采取紧急措施来制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机向苏联边境飞行”的问题。
    在安全理事会4月21日讨论这一问题时，美国代表洛奇曾经利用他作为主席的职权，千方百计地阻挠会议进行认真的讨论。但是这一次安全理事会会议是美国代表团自己坚持要召开的，美国代表团提出一个所谓北极视察问题，企图用这来代替苏联所提出的关于美国飞机的挑衅飞行的问题。
    苏联代表团向会议提出一项提案，这个提案说，安全理事会认为美国飞机的这种飞行加剧国与国之间的紧张关系，对各国人民的安全造成威胁，继续进行这种飞行可能会破坏普遍和平和爆发毁灭性的原子战争，因此，要求美国停止这种飞行。提案还说，安全理事会满意地指出，有关国家之间正在进行谈判来达成召开有政府首脑参加的会议，以讨论一些迫切的国际问题，其中包括制定措施来防止突然袭击的威胁的问题。安全理事会表示希望，有政府首脑参加的会议将在最短期间内举行。
    会议开始之后，苏联代表索波列夫问担任会议主席的美国代表洛奇：是否打算利用这样一个程序规则，就是主席在讨论同他本国有关的问题时可以把他的主席职权暂时交给安理会的其他理事。索波列夫指出，在上次会议上很难确定什么时候洛奇是以主席的身份讲话，什么时候是以美国代表的身份讲话。
    洛奇回答说，他不打算运用这个程序规则。接着他以美国代表的身份发言。洛奇提出一项提案，建议“在北极地区建立国际视察以防止突然袭击”。根据美国的提案，美国飞机的挑衅性飞行将通过建立所谓北极“国际空中视察”而合法化，美国轰炸机将继续在北极地区苏联边境附近飞行，只不过是不用美国的招牌，而改用联合国的幌子罢了。美国已经多次盗用联合国的名义和旗帜来采取险恶的挑衅活动。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，苏联向安理会发出的呼吁引起了全世界的广泛响应。美国政府不但不采取正确的决定，停止美国轰炸机朝着苏联的飞行，反而在安理会上玩弄转移视线的手法。美国的提案就是想偷偷地把关于进行北极视察的建议来代替关于制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联国境作挑衅飞行的问题，企图以此来推卸美国政府对美国飞机挑衅行为所造成的紧张局势应负的责任。
    索波列夫指出，美国所提出的关于国际视察北极圈以北的地区的提案，不仅丝毫无助于防止突然袭击的危险和缓和国际紧张局势，而且表明提出这个建议的人企图使安理会离开苏联所提出的重要问题，他们还想获得有关苏联很大一部分领土的情报资料，而苏联既没有派轰炸机向着美国边境飞行，也没有对美国或其他任何国家有任何威胁。
    紧张局势完全是由美国派遣载有原子弹和氢弹的飞机飞向苏联边境所引起的，为了消除这种紧张局势，只需要要求美国政府做出马上停止这种飞行的决定。
    索波列夫指出，美国的提案把北极视察问题从整个裁军问题中单独提了出来，美国提案中所提出的参加讨论北极视察问题的国家组成比联合国裁军委员会的组成更为片面，并且是完全脱离任何裁军问题来讨论视察问题的。美国政府这样做是企图在一个大多数成员国同美国有军事协定联系的机构中用表决方法来就一个裁军问题作出强加于人的决定，而不是想寻求有关国家间互相能够接受的协议。
    索波列夫说，不可能用表决来解决裁军问题，唯一现实的道路就是在平等和互相承认必须保障双方安全的基础上进行谈判。苏联政府认为，在有政府首脑参加的会议上，可以最有效地采取实际措施，来防止爆发战争的威胁，使整个国际局势向正常化方面转变。苏联建议在这个会议上就这样一些最重大的问题进行讨论，并且采取具体措施，这些问题在取得一致同意后就能使整个裁军问题的解决走上实际轨道。
    英国、法国和其他听命于美国的国家的代表掩饰美国提案的真正目的，企图把美国的提案说成是保障“安全”甚至是“建立信任”的手段。他们无视一个十分明显的情况：只有美国空军无条件地停止挑衅性飞行，才能建立起消除爆发核战争的威胁所必须的真正的信任。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在会上发言。他表示支持美国提案。他的演说是没有先例的，因为按照传统联合国秘书长是不能支持任何一个国家的。
    安理会会议在哈马舍尔德发言以后结束。5月2日将继续讨论。
